WEBVTT

00:47.519 --> 00:50.520
- Mama?

02:06.301 --> 02:06.860
- Marcos?

02:08.336 --> 02:10.435
Thought you were giving
me the silent treatment.

02:10.470 --> 02:11.337
It's been months.

02:12.802 --> 02:15.770
- You could've said goodbye
when you left but I get it.

02:17.477 --> 02:19.906
Look, someone's messing with us,

02:19.941 --> 02:21.512
harassing the pickers.

02:22.515 --> 02:23.646
Harvest just started

02:23.681 --> 02:25.813
and people are leaving
left and right.

02:25.848 --> 02:27.287
- Is your mom okay?

02:27.322 --> 02:29.256
- No, not really.

02:30.820 --> 02:31.951
- Well, why call me?

02:31.986 --> 02:33.260
- You're a journalist, you're-

02:33.295 --> 02:34.525
- On hiatus.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.593
- I was gonna say nosy, but

02:36.628 --> 02:37.990
you could help us, Sloane.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.794
- Famous last words.

02:39.829 --> 02:41.400
- Look, you can't
stay away forever.

02:45.736 --> 02:49.243
Sloane, please.

02:53.282 --> 02:54.710
- I do have a small
opening in my schedule.

03:32.585 --> 03:33.485
Hey George.

03:36.985 --> 03:38.523
- Hey Sloane.

03:38.558 --> 03:40.723
Welcome back to Santa Lucia

03:40.758 --> 03:44.430
where it always smells like
cow shit and sour grapes.

04:23.504 --> 04:25.339
- Hey Sloane.

04:26.606 --> 04:29.706
- Oh, hey weirdly
grown-up Marcos.

04:41.049 --> 04:42.917
- But Arthur
can't hire new workers

04:42.952 --> 04:45.117
without giving them
a place to live.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.889
- He's building a spot
over on East Palm Court.

04:49.057 --> 04:50.958
- Has anyone talked to Arthur?

04:53.468 --> 04:54.566
- He won't fight back.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.339
And the cops won't
come downtown for us.

04:59.166 --> 05:01.034
- Any idea who's behind it?

05:01.069 --> 05:02.475
- There's so many
people in this town

05:02.510 --> 05:03.707
who wish we were invisible.

05:07.042 --> 05:08.382
- I've only got a few days.

05:08.417 --> 05:09.911
- Come on, Sloane.

05:09.946 --> 05:12.111
Mom's always talking about
your journalism and stuff.

05:14.918 --> 05:17.490
- I'm supposed to start
school next month,

05:17.525 --> 05:19.019
but I can't leave if
things are like this.

06:19.917 --> 06:23.215
- This is the blend that
put Gold Rush on the map.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.492
Let me know if you want
to revisit anything

06:25.527 --> 06:26.823
and please take your time.

06:30.092 --> 06:31.696
Oh, Dulce, meet Sloane,

06:31.731 --> 06:33.599
my one and only stepdaughter.

06:33.634 --> 06:34.534
This is Dulce,

06:34.569 --> 06:36.569
she's my right hand around here.

06:36.604 --> 06:37.803
- Pleasure.

06:37.839 --> 06:40.870
- Hey, they're on number four
and try and be nice, would ya?

06:40.905 --> 06:42.608
She writes for
"New World Wines".

06:42.643 --> 06:43.543
- Always.

06:43.578 --> 06:45.039
How'd they like the pinot?

06:45.074 --> 06:46.007
- She liked it.

06:46.042 --> 06:47.844
He thought it was peppery.

06:47.879 --> 06:49.747
- Wait till they try the 2016.

06:49.782 --> 06:50.682
- Exactly.

06:50.717 --> 06:51.749
- Nice to meet you Sloane.

06:51.784 --> 06:53.014
- Okay.

06:53.049 --> 06:54.521
Let me get this.

07:00.826 --> 07:01.957
- Didn't touch a thing.

07:04.533 --> 07:05.257
Just like your mom used to-

07:05.292 --> 07:06.533
- Thanks.

07:08.867 --> 07:10.735
Didn't see much of
a crew out there.

07:10.770 --> 07:12.671
- Ah, we are a
little shorthanded.

07:12.706 --> 07:13.672
Everybody seems to want to work

07:13.707 --> 07:16.136
for Mariela Vicuña this year.

07:16.171 --> 07:17.544
What's her secret?

07:17.579 --> 07:18.578
- You worried?

07:18.613 --> 07:19.777
- Never.

07:19.812 --> 07:21.273
As soon as our
new worker housing

07:21.308 --> 07:23.616
gets up and running next
week, we should be golden.

07:24.619 --> 07:26.586
Good to have you home, Sloane.

07:26.621 --> 07:27.653
Unexpected.

07:28.590 --> 07:30.216
- I won't stay for long.

07:30.251 --> 07:31.855
- Well, I'm honored to have you.

08:16.033 --> 08:18.297
- Oh hey, gotta be careful,

08:20.037 --> 08:22.609
there's a lot of fuel
for a fire out here.

08:28.177 --> 08:29.682
How long you worked for Arthur?

08:29.717 --> 08:31.618
- Worked on the
vines about two weeks

08:31.653 --> 08:34.313
and then we started talking.

08:34.348 --> 08:35.853
Been inside about a month.

08:36.823 --> 08:37.756
He's a good man.

08:38.891 --> 08:40.319
- Indeed.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.320
- I'm sorry about your mom.

08:43.093 --> 08:45.159
Arthur told me she passed
away in the spring.

08:45.194 --> 08:47.634
I'm sure she was
a wonderful woman.

08:47.669 --> 08:48.899
- Well, you didn't know her.

08:51.673 --> 08:53.607
You had any trouble since
you started working here?

08:53.642 --> 08:54.201
- Trouble?

08:55.710 --> 08:56.709
No.

08:58.405 --> 08:59.778
Trouble can't touch me here.

09:01.144 --> 09:02.242
- Heard any rumors?

09:02.277 --> 09:04.244
- I don't get out much.

09:04.279 --> 09:05.619
- Indoor cat, huh?

10:12.952 --> 10:13.984
Hey!

10:14.019 --> 10:14.820
Hey!

10:57.359 --> 10:58.490
- Watch it, pal.

10:58.525 --> 11:00.426
Hey, Sloane!

11:00.461 --> 11:03.198
- Gerry, nice bike.

11:03.233 --> 11:04.397
- Thanks.

11:04.432 --> 11:06.036
- Nice mustache.

11:06.071 --> 11:06.905
- Thanks.

11:08.777 --> 11:10.744
- Hey, you see a guy
all in black run past,

11:10.779 --> 11:12.438
smelled like dead meat?

11:12.473 --> 11:14.814
- I haven't seen
or smelled anybody

11:14.849 --> 11:17.014
out of the ordinary
tonight, Sloaney.

11:17.049 --> 11:18.752
- Okay.

11:18.787 --> 11:22.888
- Hey, I get why you left
without saying goodbye, I do.

11:24.122 --> 11:26.826
At the funeral, I just wanted
to tell you how sorry I am.

11:29.226 --> 11:32.997
But you know, it's like
my girlfriend says,

11:33.032 --> 11:35.461
you know, the past is the past,

11:35.496 --> 11:39.740
the future is a mystery and the
present is, well, a present.

11:44.076 --> 11:45.306
- It's good to see ya, Ger.

11:45.341 --> 11:46.175
- Yeah.

11:47.475 --> 11:49.508
- I have said repeatedly

11:49.543 --> 11:54.117
power lines within 8.75
yards of private homes

11:54.152 --> 11:57.252
means that each one
of us are guinea pigs

11:57.287 --> 12:00.321
for big telcom's
latest radiation tech.

12:00.356 --> 12:02.829
- Thank you for that, Alice.

12:02.864 --> 12:04.798
See you next week,

12:04.833 --> 12:05.766
I'm sure.

12:08.199 --> 12:11.805
And now Ms. Patty Ernst,
county supervisor.

12:13.171 --> 12:14.907
- Oh please, you can
just call me Super Patty.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.877
We can skip all the
fancy formalities, yeah.

12:20.508 --> 12:25.511
This is about safety,
neighborhood safety,

12:26.954 --> 12:29.152
the safety of our
precious community,

12:30.188 --> 12:33.453
safety and security,

12:33.488 --> 12:35.895
security for our children.

12:37.096 --> 12:38.392
We know how important

12:38.427 --> 12:40.328
farm workers are to
our little community,

12:40.363 --> 12:43.936
but commercial housing and
residential neighborhoods

12:43.971 --> 12:45.399
just do not mix.

12:47.271 --> 12:49.073
Arthur Stendhal's new facility

12:50.241 --> 12:52.406
would force over
a dozen strangers

12:52.441 --> 12:54.474
into a quiet neighborhood.

12:55.543 --> 12:56.476
For Joe Dunney's wife, Barb,

12:56.511 --> 12:59.952
home alone while he's
traveling for John Deere

12:59.987 --> 13:01.217
or for little Sue Ellen Mason

13:01.252 --> 13:03.582
who loves playing
outside with her dolls.

13:03.617 --> 13:08.961
I move to change
Zoning Law 647 tonight

13:10.096 --> 13:14.835
for the safety and
security of our community.

13:16.069 --> 13:18.102
- All in favor, say aye.

13:18.137 --> 13:20.599
- Aye.

13:20.634 --> 13:21.842
- All opposed.

13:26.376 --> 13:28.244
The motion is defeated.

13:34.252 --> 13:36.252
- Can you believe this?

13:36.287 --> 13:38.122
- It's hard to beat a
Stendhal around here.

13:38.157 --> 13:40.223
- God, you're telling me.

14:33.080 --> 14:33.914
- Hello?

14:34.741 --> 14:35.982
What?

14:37.414 --> 14:38.248
Sloane!

15:12.251 --> 15:13.712
You happy now?

15:13.747 --> 15:16.451
No more farm workers making
your neighborhood unsafe.

15:16.486 --> 15:17.386
- Arthur.

15:19.093 --> 15:20.719
- Oh Jesus.

15:50.256 --> 15:52.685
'06 Zin, best of the harvest.

15:56.460 --> 15:58.097
- Prefer an IPA.

15:58.132 --> 15:59.131
- Hmm?

15:59.166 --> 16:00.000
- Kidding.

16:00.936 --> 16:03.696
What are you gonna do
without that housing?

16:03.731 --> 16:05.038
- Oh, don't worry.

16:05.073 --> 16:06.699
They think this'll keep us down.

16:07.603 --> 16:08.569
It's just a hiccup.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.044
- Some hiccup.

16:12.674 --> 16:14.080
Who do you think did it?

16:15.316 --> 16:17.281
- I think it could have been
any one of those fine citizens

16:17.316 --> 16:18.546
at the meeting last night

16:19.714 --> 16:21.318
or maybe it really
was an accident.

16:22.321 --> 16:23.485
- Uh huh.

16:23.520 --> 16:24.586
- You know, I've been
working this land

16:24.621 --> 16:27.126
ever since I was old enough
to hold a pair of shears.

16:28.558 --> 16:31.064
Grandpa always wanted me
to concentrate on school,

16:31.099 --> 16:35.695
but I couldn't wait to race
home and work in the vines.

16:35.730 --> 16:37.136
- I know this story.

16:37.864 --> 16:38.730
- Yeah, did I ever tell ya

16:38.765 --> 16:41.173
your mom wanted me
to give the place up?

16:41.208 --> 16:43.142
"Take me to Tuscany," she'd say.

16:44.145 --> 16:45.210
But I couldn't do it.

16:46.543 --> 16:49.379
And so she became the
best damn co-owner

16:49.414 --> 16:50.578
I could ever imagine.

16:51.746 --> 16:52.646
- Low bar.

16:54.485 --> 16:57.090
- You used to race home
to work in the vines too

16:57.851 --> 16:59.620
and interview the pickers.

16:59.655 --> 17:01.787
I still have your first article.

17:01.822 --> 17:03.063
- Missed the Pulitzer by...

17:05.661 --> 17:06.660
- This place.

17:07.597 --> 17:08.827
- It's in your blood.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.202
- And it'll stay that way.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.001
Hey, have you seen Dulce?

17:17.037 --> 17:20.377
She was supposed to come in
early and stock up for us.

17:20.412 --> 17:21.873
- Not a glimpse.

17:21.908 --> 17:23.347
- Do you mind keeping an
eye on things for an hour?

17:23.382 --> 17:24.744
I've got to go down
to the cop shop

17:24.779 --> 17:26.185
and give a statement.

17:26.220 --> 17:27.615
- You think they're
gonna do anything?

17:27.650 --> 17:29.848
- I think they're probably
relieved it burned.

17:46.636 --> 17:49.274
- I was hoping you could help me

17:50.244 --> 17:52.145
once you've dried off.

17:52.180 --> 17:53.872
- We don't open till 10.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.808
- I'm not a customer.

17:58.945 --> 17:59.878
- He bite?

18:00.947 --> 18:02.848
- It depends.

18:02.883 --> 18:03.684
- On?

18:04.951 --> 18:05.984
- If I'm in danger.

18:06.019 --> 18:08.227
- You're safe here as
long as you like Cabernet.

18:08.262 --> 18:10.922
- I wouldn't know a
Cabernet from a fruit punch.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.264
- Just the man for me.

18:16.897 --> 18:21.207
- I'm looking for Dulce,
Dulce Lopez Castillo.

18:21.242 --> 18:22.637
My friend's sister. She
hasn't been home for weeks

18:22.672 --> 18:24.474
and they're worried.

18:24.509 --> 18:27.279
- Seems to handle
herself just fine.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.808
- So you know her?

18:28.843 --> 18:30.348
- I wouldn't say know.

18:30.383 --> 18:32.185
- What would you say?

18:32.220 --> 18:33.285
- She works here.

18:34.387 --> 18:36.288
- I need to talk to her.

18:36.323 --> 18:38.257
- Well, she didn't
come in today.

18:38.292 --> 18:39.687
- She's a sweet kid.

18:41.295 --> 18:42.954
She's kind of a magnet
for trouble though.

18:42.989 --> 18:45.165
Would you know
anything about that?

18:50.568 --> 18:53.437
Well, if she shows, could
you have her call me?

18:53.472 --> 18:54.438
I'm at Bettie B's.

18:55.441 --> 18:56.440
- Riverside Ave.

18:56.475 --> 18:58.277
- That's the one.

18:58.312 --> 18:59.179
What's wrong, bedbugs?

19:00.347 --> 19:01.346
- Not since the '90's.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.184
- Room 305.

19:05.913 --> 19:08.221
Tico, Tico Reyes.

19:09.752 --> 19:11.290
- Sloane Sawyer.

19:17.562 --> 19:19.463
- Just in case.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.039
- How'd it go?

19:33.075 --> 19:36.282
- Just small town cops trying
to do the least work possible.

19:37.846 --> 19:39.879
Hey, Gerry said he saw
you the other night,

19:39.914 --> 19:41.617
almost knocked him on his ass.

19:41.652 --> 19:42.816
- Sounds about right.

19:44.655 --> 19:46.919
- First the fire, now Dulce.

19:46.954 --> 19:49.790
It's not turning into
a great day, is it?

19:49.825 --> 19:51.759
- This kind of
thing happen often?

19:51.794 --> 19:53.266
- No, she's reliable.

19:54.698 --> 19:57.732
I used to let your mom have
the tough talks with employees.

19:57.767 --> 19:59.030
- Can we leave her out of this?

19:59.065 --> 20:01.373
- Sloane, we can talk about her.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.309
We should talk about her.

20:03.344 --> 20:04.277
You must have questions.

20:04.312 --> 20:06.708
- I don't want details
if that's what you mean.

20:06.743 --> 20:08.314
- Well, I barely saw
you at the funeral.

20:08.349 --> 20:10.250
- Well, I had to
get back to work.

20:11.418 --> 20:12.516
- Look, I know it
can't have been easy

20:12.551 --> 20:14.452
for you to be away
when she died.

20:15.323 --> 20:16.322
You can talk to me.

20:16.357 --> 20:17.455
- No, Jesus!

20:20.724 --> 20:21.921
- I just miss her, Sloane.

20:30.371 --> 20:31.865
- So you haven't
heard from Dulce?

20:31.900 --> 20:32.532
- No.

20:33.902 --> 20:36.342
- Do you know where she stays?

20:36.377 --> 20:37.673
- No, actually I don't.

20:40.040 --> 20:40.874
- Cell number?

20:42.350 --> 20:44.449
- Yeah, it's right
there on the register.

20:56.793 --> 20:58.397
- At the
tone, please record-

20:58.432 --> 20:59.464
- Voicemail.

21:01.468 --> 21:02.060
Catch you later.

21:19.750 --> 21:21.519
No room for the
competition, huh?

21:21.554 --> 21:24.621
- I just know what's best
for this town is all.

21:24.656 --> 21:26.359
- And what's that?

21:26.394 --> 21:27.723
- Safety and

21:27.758 --> 21:29.120
- Security.

21:29.155 --> 21:31.430
- You've been to
one of my rallies?

21:35.634 --> 21:36.996
Oh right.

21:38.065 --> 21:41.132
Well, I'm county
supervisor, Patty Ernst.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.540
- Sloane.

21:42.575 --> 21:44.069
- You registered to vote Sloane?

21:44.104 --> 21:46.412
- You heard about that fire
down on East Palm Court?

21:46.447 --> 21:48.139
- Yeah, it's a pity,

21:48.174 --> 21:50.383
but it's a good thing
they contained it

21:50.418 --> 21:52.583
before it jumped over
to anybody's home.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.651
Sloane what?

21:54.686 --> 21:55.784
- Sawyer.

21:55.819 --> 21:57.555
- Nora's girl.

21:57.590 --> 22:00.052
Yeah, I guess you
do look like her.

22:00.087 --> 22:01.724
She knew my brother pretty well,

22:01.759 --> 22:03.924
you know, before he
cleaned up, of course.

22:05.092 --> 22:07.092
He's working on my campaign now.

22:07.127 --> 22:09.864
Thinks I have a pretty
good shot at Congress.

22:09.899 --> 22:11.162
- Well, they can have you.

22:36.926 --> 22:37.558
- Hey!

22:40.160 --> 22:41.863
What are you playing at, girl?

22:43.603 --> 22:44.602
- I'm on my way out.

22:53.877 --> 22:54.711
Excuse me.

22:56.242 --> 22:57.450
- Hey, private property.

22:59.850 --> 23:01.179
- This okay?

23:01.214 --> 23:02.620
- Can't stop you.

23:05.119 --> 23:06.657
- Timothy.

23:06.692 --> 23:08.120
- Sloane.

23:08.155 --> 23:10.760
- I didn't recognize you
with all that artwork.

23:10.795 --> 23:12.795
- Yeah, it's
pretty cool, right?

23:14.227 --> 23:15.831
- You know that guy's name?

23:15.866 --> 23:17.470
- Nope.

23:17.505 --> 23:18.999
- You see the fire last night?

23:19.034 --> 23:21.639
- I was tucked in tight
all night, officer.

23:21.674 --> 23:23.069
There's seven people
who'd swear to it.

23:23.104 --> 23:24.708
- Chill dude, just asking.

23:25.711 --> 23:26.545
- Good riddance.

23:27.845 --> 23:28.943
- Seriously?

23:31.244 --> 23:34.718
- This is a residential
neighborhood.

23:34.753 --> 23:36.489
- Yeah and what'd you think
the workers were gonna do,

23:36.524 --> 23:37.985
reside here, right?

23:38.020 --> 23:39.690
- Be gone, college girl.

24:35.649 --> 24:36.747
- Hello?

24:36.782 --> 24:38.551
- Oh, looking for somebody?

24:38.586 --> 24:39.385
- Where is everyone?

24:39.420 --> 24:41.686
- Big wildfire down
past the canyon.

24:41.721 --> 24:43.314
They're saying it
might jump the freeway.

24:43.349 --> 24:45.316
So our boys headed
out this morning,

24:45.351 --> 24:47.692
left me here to
take care of things.

24:47.727 --> 24:50.156
- Is anyone investigating
the East Palm Court fire?

24:50.191 --> 24:51.696
- A doozy, huh?

24:51.731 --> 24:55.601
Lucky it didn't set that
whole neighborhood on fire.

24:55.636 --> 24:57.163
People are so reckless.

24:57.198 --> 24:58.637
- You think someone started it?

24:58.672 --> 25:01.739
- Do I look like I
work for the ATF?

25:01.774 --> 25:05.710
But I know an accelerated
fire when I see one.

25:05.745 --> 25:07.173
- They find anything
on the scene?

25:07.208 --> 25:08.647
- Haven't had a chance.

25:08.682 --> 25:11.650
God knows how long they'll
be on that wildfire.

25:11.685 --> 25:14.246
Worst I've seen in 40 years.

25:14.281 --> 25:15.115
- Thanks.

25:35.775 --> 25:36.367
- Hey.

25:36.402 --> 25:38.138
- Hey, you guys okay?

25:38.173 --> 25:40.140
- Well we're not on fire, yet.

25:42.815 --> 25:43.946
- Well, it's true.

25:46.148 --> 25:49.655
- I saw the fantasma,
but he got away.

27:01.762 --> 27:03.124
- Sloane Sawyer.

27:49.403 --> 27:51.502
- Bettie B's Motel?

27:51.537 --> 27:52.778
- Hi, could you put me through

27:52.813 --> 27:54.472
to Ms. Dulce Lopez
Castillo's room?

27:54.507 --> 27:56.012
- Oh, the phone's down in there.

27:56.047 --> 27:57.442
I'd try knocking.

27:57.477 --> 27:59.983
- Gosh, I just can't
remember which room it was.

28:00.018 --> 28:01.512
I know I have it here somewhere.

28:01.547 --> 28:04.823
- Might want to try writing
it in a safer place next time.

28:05.793 --> 28:06.759
- Thanks for the tip.

28:21.842 --> 28:22.973
- Hello?

28:23.008 --> 28:24.271
- It's
Sloane, Sloane Sawyer.

28:24.306 --> 28:25.503
- Hello, Sloane Sawyer.

28:25.538 --> 28:27.813
It's really nice
to hear from you.

28:27.848 --> 28:31.542
- Right, Dulce, she's actually
staying at your hotel.

28:31.577 --> 28:35.348
I'd check it out, but I'm busy.

28:35.383 --> 28:36.921
- I'll see what I can find out.

28:38.320 --> 28:40.859
- Meet me at the
Bar-with-No-Name, eight p.m.?

28:40.894 --> 28:42.894
- Should I wear my cowboy boots?

28:42.929 --> 28:45.292
- Just got a busted
sign, that's all.

28:45.327 --> 28:47.195
I think it's called Marvin's.

28:47.230 --> 28:49.461
- Yeah, it's a date.

29:22.529 --> 29:23.429
- Oh, hey Sloane.

29:25.004 --> 29:27.939
Hey listen, I'm real sorry
about earlier, you know?

29:27.974 --> 29:29.600
I hate to fight with you.

29:29.635 --> 29:31.272
- Always have.

29:31.307 --> 29:32.438
- I come in peace.

29:33.606 --> 29:36.013
- I wanted to see if
you heard from Dulce.

29:36.048 --> 29:37.146
- Dulce?

29:37.181 --> 29:38.378
I did.

29:38.413 --> 29:40.479
She called, she's laid
out with pneumonia.

29:40.514 --> 29:42.954
I told her to take all
the time she needed.

29:42.989 --> 29:44.923
Hey, are you free for dinner?

29:46.025 --> 29:47.024
I'm cooking.

29:48.159 --> 29:49.422
- Can't make it.

29:49.457 --> 29:50.456
- All right.

30:48.989 --> 30:49.988
- Hey!

30:51.288 --> 30:54.553
- You again, what's
your problem?

30:59.164 --> 31:00.966
- Mistaken identity.

31:20.152 --> 31:22.152
Are you following me?

31:22.187 --> 31:23.582
- It's a small town.

31:23.617 --> 31:25.925
- Well, you cruised
down the right street.

31:27.225 --> 31:30.490
Seems to be kind of an epidemic
around here, flat tires.

31:31.526 --> 31:33.031
- There's lots of sharp rocks.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.462
- Yeah, that must be it.

31:37.202 --> 31:38.135
- Work.

31:39.006 --> 31:40.434
So I bought Bettie a drink,

31:40.469 --> 31:44.075
diet orange soda to be
exact, loosened right up.

31:45.243 --> 31:47.507
Dulce left suddenly
a few nights back,

31:47.542 --> 31:49.740
emptied her room, paid her tab.

31:49.775 --> 31:51.016
She's gone.

31:51.051 --> 31:51.676
- Hmm.

31:53.053 --> 31:54.745
What can you tell
me about Dulce?

31:54.780 --> 31:57.451
- She had great penmanship.

31:57.486 --> 31:58.650
No, no, it's true.

31:58.685 --> 32:00.718
I saw her jotting
something down one day

32:00.753 --> 32:04.194
and it was, it was beautiful.

32:04.229 --> 32:07.131
She said she liked letters,
like little worlds.

32:07.166 --> 32:09.265
- So what'd, she want
to be a calligrapher?

32:09.300 --> 32:10.398
- She'd be good at it.

32:11.632 --> 32:13.764
- You're a pretty good
friend, aren't you?

32:13.799 --> 32:14.865
- What do you mean?

32:14.900 --> 32:17.042
- Well, you said she was
a friend's sister, right?

32:17.077 --> 32:19.440
It's a lot of trouble to
go to all by yourself.

32:20.608 --> 32:23.279
- He's working, I
had some free time.

32:26.548 --> 32:28.020
You getting in?

32:52.838 --> 32:54.475
- How are you doing Sawyer?

32:54.510 --> 32:56.642
- Hey Jen, long time-

32:56.677 --> 32:57.577
- Yeah, yeah.

32:57.612 --> 32:59.051
Nice to see your ugly mug, kid.

32:59.086 --> 33:01.053
Last time I saw her,

33:01.088 --> 33:04.056
let's just say someone
ended up in the hospital.

33:06.126 --> 33:10.095
So what can I get you and
this handsome fella here?

33:10.823 --> 33:12.526
- Bourbon, rocks.

33:13.562 --> 33:14.396
- Same.

33:17.764 --> 33:21.271
- Ah, so you put
somebody in the hospital?

33:26.806 --> 33:29.378
- One of her regulars was drunk,

33:29.413 --> 33:33.184
not that drunk, and
got a little fresh

33:33.219 --> 33:35.219
so I may have broken his arm.

33:37.388 --> 33:38.222
- Okay.

33:45.594 --> 33:46.660
You like to dance?

33:46.695 --> 33:50.729
- It makes me feel less
like I'm going to explode.

34:52.859 --> 34:53.660
One more drink?

34:54.861 --> 34:56.630
- No, no I better
not, I'm driving.

34:56.665 --> 34:57.297
- Where to?

35:00.207 --> 35:01.173
Man's best friend.

35:02.376 --> 35:05.672
- You're looking at
little flushed there, princess.

35:05.707 --> 35:06.475
- Bourbon.

35:06.510 --> 35:07.608
- Rocks.

35:10.877 --> 35:11.711
- Sorry.

35:13.286 --> 35:17.288
So I want to know what
makes a girl leave town

35:17.323 --> 35:18.256
without saying goodbye.

35:19.459 --> 35:22.359
- Were you nervous I wasn't
gonna be here when you got back?

35:22.394 --> 35:23.888
- Deflection.

35:23.923 --> 35:24.823
- Intrusion.

35:31.832 --> 35:33.337
- Thought I was getting
too deep on the first date

35:33.372 --> 35:34.503
eh, Sawyer?

35:38.344 --> 35:40.245
I hate the circumstances

35:40.280 --> 35:42.181
but I can't help
enjoying the company.

35:53.491 --> 35:54.523
Where did you find this?

35:54.558 --> 35:55.524
- It's Dulce's.

35:57.495 --> 35:58.956
There was a fire
the other night,

35:58.991 --> 36:01.266
my stepdad's new worker housing.

36:04.502 --> 36:05.336
- Let's go.

36:14.380 --> 36:16.380
What did the fire
department find?

36:17.416 --> 36:18.778
- The whole place

36:18.813 --> 36:20.285
went to fight that wildfire
south of the canyon.

36:21.750 --> 36:23.222
- And why didn't you tell
me about this earlier?

36:24.753 --> 36:26.357
- I didn't know if
I could trust you.

36:40.032 --> 36:41.999
- I'll let you know what
we find out, Ms. Sawyer.

36:42.034 --> 36:43.067
- You don't need
to miss me, Gerry.

36:43.102 --> 36:46.003
We've had bath time together,
I've seen you naked.

36:46.038 --> 36:49.413
- I'm a police officer
now, Sloane, Ms. Sawyer.

36:49.448 --> 36:51.547
I need to be proper,
professional and all.

36:52.715 --> 36:54.979
- Sorry, I'm just
a little shaken

36:55.014 --> 36:57.850
on account of that barbecued
human jaw I just unearthed.

36:59.524 --> 37:01.051
You think it's her?

37:01.086 --> 37:03.493
- The damage is too
extensive to tell.

37:03.528 --> 37:05.330
I'm sure fire will
send a team in,

37:05.365 --> 37:08.366
maybe they can figure
it out from the teeth.

37:09.402 --> 37:11.534
- What's the hold up, McDonnell?

37:11.569 --> 37:13.503
Quit flirting with the witness.

37:14.770 --> 37:17.034
- You should take
his job someday.

37:17.069 --> 37:17.903
- Thanks, Sloaney.

37:31.116 --> 37:32.786
- You know that guy.

37:33.954 --> 37:36.020
- Yeah, he's just a
friend of the family.

37:37.430 --> 37:39.793
- Doesn't seem to care much
about burned body parts.

37:53.413 --> 37:55.413
- Oh, I almost forgot,

37:56.548 --> 37:59.109
a little bit of orange
soda goes a long way.

37:59.144 --> 38:02.420
It's Dulce's, you want to see
if she left anything behind?

38:04.050 --> 38:07.623
- Why don't you check
it out and report back?

38:07.658 --> 38:09.361
- It's not far.

38:09.396 --> 38:10.956
- What, are you trying to
get me back to your place?

38:30.813 --> 38:33.847
I can't go in there.

38:36.489 --> 38:37.818
- Place must be haunted, right?

38:38.854 --> 38:40.084
Bettie B got to talking,

38:40.119 --> 38:43.461
said that some people
have died there.

38:43.496 --> 38:44.462
- Did she?

38:44.497 --> 38:46.662
- Yeah, a woman.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.368
- My mom.

38:53.704 --> 38:57.706
She'd been clean for years,

38:57.741 --> 39:01.138
but then one thing
led to another

39:01.173 --> 39:05.846
and then she overdosed there.

39:07.454 --> 39:09.553
- Oh my God, your mom.

39:11.557 --> 39:12.189
- She was here

39:15.495 --> 39:17.462
and I was a million miles away.

39:24.097 --> 39:24.931
Goodnight.

40:40.107 --> 40:41.271
- Car trouble?

40:41.306 --> 40:43.845
- That's why they've
got Gus's Banana Towing.

40:43.880 --> 40:45.616
- Best in town.

40:45.651 --> 40:47.618
You know, I was surprised to see

40:47.653 --> 40:49.114
you with the
competition last night.

40:49.149 --> 40:50.215
- What?

40:50.250 --> 40:53.558
- That slick fellow you
were with, Alejandro Vicuña.

40:53.593 --> 40:54.790
- Vicuña?

40:54.825 --> 40:57.628
- Yeah, aren't they Gold
Rush's biggest rivals?

40:57.663 --> 40:59.696
- He said his name was Reyes.

40:59.731 --> 41:01.533
- Alejandro Reyes Vicuña.

41:02.932 --> 41:04.096
I looked at his license.

41:04.967 --> 41:06.604
- Why don't I know him?

41:06.639 --> 41:08.837
- He went to some fancy
East Coast boarding school,

41:08.872 --> 41:10.641
but he's back now.

41:10.676 --> 41:12.137
Whole place will be his one day

41:12.172 --> 41:13.776
if Mariela ever .

41:15.648 --> 41:16.977
- Thanks Ger, I owe you one.

41:23.986 --> 41:25.150
Bettie B's Motel?

41:25.185 --> 41:27.251
- Can you put me
through to room 305?

41:27.286 --> 41:28.252
- Checked out.

41:28.287 --> 41:29.220
- What?

41:29.255 --> 41:30.958
- I'm
gonna miss that fella.

41:30.993 --> 41:31.893
He was cute.

44:02.144 --> 44:03.847
- Get that
for me, will ya?

44:14.761 --> 44:15.760
- She's dead.

44:16.896 --> 44:19.390
- , I don't believe you.

44:19.425 --> 44:20.732
- That's not gonna
change the facts, mother.

44:20.767 --> 44:23.295
They found her
bracelet at the fire.

44:23.330 --> 44:25.396
- What took you so long?

44:25.431 --> 44:28.036
- I was
gathering information.

44:28.071 --> 44:29.466
- Dancing at a bar.

44:29.501 --> 44:31.303
That's just what I heard.

44:31.338 --> 44:33.074
- You have little
birdies everywhere, don't you?

44:33.109 --> 44:36.473
- You make me sound like
I'm some sort of spy.

44:36.508 --> 44:38.750
Is it that Sawyer girl?

44:38.785 --> 44:40.818
I heard she's back in town.

44:40.853 --> 44:42.281
- She's nothing.

44:42.316 --> 44:44.085
- What
kind of nothing?

44:44.120 --> 44:46.318
- The nothing kind, mother.

44:46.353 --> 44:48.793
She's just a sad girl
in over her head.

44:59.069 --> 44:59.870
- Hello.

45:01.874 --> 45:03.467
- Alejandro, don't
just stand there.

45:06.406 --> 45:07.812
- Thanks, Alejandro.

45:16.581 --> 45:19.252
- If Arthur wanted to see
me he could've just called.

45:20.519 --> 45:21.518
I'm sure he has my number

45:21.554 --> 45:24.158
from the many times I
tried to buy that vineyard.

45:24.193 --> 45:25.896
- Arthur
doesn't know I'm here.

45:27.064 --> 45:27.898
- Huh.

45:29.935 --> 45:30.802
Alejandro, dale.

45:46.446 --> 45:50.283
Mezcal, it's my special recipe.

45:51.385 --> 45:52.989
I've been importing
it from Mexico

45:53.024 --> 45:54.958
long before it was so trendy.

45:58.491 --> 46:01.998
Alejandro was just telling
me about Arthur's fire,

46:02.033 --> 46:03.131
very unfortunate.

46:04.464 --> 46:06.167
- He didn't say
whose fire it was.

46:08.105 --> 46:10.534
- Little eavesdropper,
aren't you?

46:18.511 --> 46:22.183
Is it true that our
Dulce was there?

46:22.218 --> 46:27.221
That she, that she
died in the fire?

46:29.962 --> 46:34.965
- They, they have to examine
everything before they're sure.

46:36.628 --> 46:39.563
They only found parts.

46:41.237 --> 46:42.940
- She's been with us for years.

46:44.471 --> 46:48.176
You know, like a daughter to me.

46:48.211 --> 46:49.848
- She's not your daughter.

46:52.347 --> 46:54.083
- Alejandro,

46:54.118 --> 46:57.317
Alejandro please,
just give us a minute.

46:57.352 --> 47:00.155
Okay, please.

47:09.694 --> 47:10.869
Let me take a look.

47:17.273 --> 47:18.910
You're a tough cookie.

47:20.276 --> 47:21.946
- It may not be her.

47:21.981 --> 47:24.982
- I thought they found her
silver bracelet in the ashes.

47:26.216 --> 47:29.921
You know, that was a gift from
us, that is Bradley and me.

47:31.958 --> 47:33.320
- Your husband?

47:33.355 --> 47:37.995
- Yeah, he was a real
connoisseur of jewelry, wine,

47:41.726 --> 47:43.264
other things.

47:47.105 --> 47:48.335
Here, look,

47:49.602 --> 47:51.140
all found on the property.

47:52.242 --> 47:54.979
My great, great grandmother

47:55.014 --> 47:57.311
probably skinned a mountain
lion with one of these.

48:00.987 --> 48:02.217
Let me show you around.

48:02.252 --> 48:04.021
- Oh...
- Oh, I insist.

48:06.289 --> 48:08.960
- This dirt is in my bones.

48:13.098 --> 48:13.932
Limestone,

48:15.760 --> 48:20.136
gives our wines their
special minerality.

48:20.171 --> 48:21.005
Wow!

48:29.708 --> 48:33.149
- This is my favorite
place in the world.

48:34.350 --> 48:37.120
Nothing could ever take
me away from this land.

48:37.155 --> 48:38.385
- I hope nothing tries.

48:40.191 --> 48:41.685
- Will you help
me find our Dulce?

48:43.524 --> 48:44.490
I'm afraid for her.

48:45.790 --> 48:46.624
Please.

48:48.133 --> 48:49.165
- Fine, okay.

48:51.400 --> 48:54.731
- Well Sloane, it's
been a pleasure.

48:57.670 --> 48:58.636
- Oh .

49:45.091 --> 49:47.058
- Harvest time.

49:48.193 --> 49:49.027
- Hello.

49:52.164 --> 49:55.693
- Grapes everywhere
for the picking,

49:56.729 --> 49:59.169
hands stained red.

50:01.569 --> 50:03.239
Too much work to be done.

50:12.712 --> 50:15.119
- Hey Sloane,
listen please.

50:15.154 --> 50:16.714
- And why should I do that?

50:16.749 --> 50:18.221
- Because I can explain.

50:18.256 --> 50:18.848
- Pretty line.

50:18.883 --> 50:20.487
- I mean it.

50:20.522 --> 50:22.126
- You don't mean anything,
not even your name.

50:22.161 --> 50:24.194
- Tico is a nickname.

50:24.229 --> 50:25.228
- Cute.

50:25.264 --> 50:26.856
- It's what you call
somebody from Costa Rica.

50:26.891 --> 50:27.824
- Well, I heard it's
lovely this time of year.

50:27.859 --> 50:30.662
- It's where my dad is
from, okay my birth dad,

50:30.697 --> 50:32.763
until he skipped out years ago.

50:32.798 --> 50:34.831
- Let me know where to
send my condolences.

50:34.866 --> 50:38.835
- Bradley was a real
father to me my whole life

50:38.870 --> 50:40.672
until Mariela kicked him out.

50:41.840 --> 50:43.609
- She talks about
him like he's dead.

50:44.876 --> 50:47.877
- You don't know what you're
getting yourself into here.

50:47.912 --> 50:49.285
- Yeah, well funny
how that happens

50:49.320 --> 50:51.188
when you hang
around with a liar.

50:51.883 --> 50:52.750
- Okay, I deserve that.

50:52.785 --> 50:54.191
- Yeah and a lot more,

50:54.226 --> 50:56.193
but maybe I'm too sad
and too in over my head

50:56.228 --> 50:57.491
to know better.

50:57.526 --> 50:59.130
- I didn't, I didn't mean-

50:59.165 --> 51:00.659
- Sure, none of us meant.

51:01.563 --> 51:05.433
- Sloane.

51:05.468 --> 51:08.139
Vicuña blood runs
deep here, Sloane,

51:08.174 --> 51:09.734
as deep as it can get.

51:09.769 --> 51:11.472
Mariela chews people out

51:11.507 --> 51:12.704
and she spits them out,

51:12.739 --> 51:13.903
but they don't come
out looking the same,

51:13.938 --> 51:16.741
they look more like Picassos.

51:16.776 --> 51:18.710
- Hey, next time I need
an art history lesson,

51:18.745 --> 51:19.810
I'll call you.

51:19.845 --> 51:22.582
- Hey, I lied, okay,

51:24.289 --> 51:26.223
but not about everything.

51:29.459 --> 51:30.557
- Alejandro?

51:32.264 --> 51:34.231
- Run home, Alejandro.

51:34.266 --> 51:36.299
- Alejandro?

52:41.564 --> 52:42.860
- Seems like you're
the person to ask

52:42.895 --> 52:44.598
about history around here.

52:44.633 --> 52:45.863
- I just like to figure out

52:45.898 --> 52:48.602
how the puzzle fits
together, you know?

52:48.637 --> 52:51.341
And what kind of puzzle
are you piecing together?

52:51.376 --> 52:54.278
- What can you tell
me about the Vicuñas?

52:54.313 --> 52:56.511
- You're working with
your step-daddy, right?

52:56.546 --> 52:57.380
- That's right.

52:58.878 --> 53:02.253
- Here land is everything.

53:02.288 --> 53:04.552
The Vicuña family
had two branches,

53:04.587 --> 53:07.016
Chumash Indian and pure Mexican.

53:07.051 --> 53:11.020
So they think of the
land as doubly theirs.

53:11.055 --> 53:14.760
And then, well, you
know what happened.

53:14.795 --> 53:17.466
- European immigrants
like the Stendhals come in

53:17.501 --> 53:20.898
and grab whatever they can,
original owners be damned.

53:21.835 --> 53:24.341
- But the land remembers.

53:24.376 --> 53:25.672
- Remembers what?

53:25.707 --> 53:28.004
- Mariela's family history.

53:28.039 --> 53:31.414
Arthur's people?
Newcomers. Trespassers.

53:34.749 --> 53:36.287
Excuse me, dear.

54:58.536 --> 54:59.733
- Get the hell off me.

54:59.768 --> 55:02.131
- Don't you know this
is private property?

55:02.166 --> 55:04.408
Who's gonna pay for
all my tires, huh?

55:09.943 --> 55:10.876
You always were
asking to get hurt,

55:10.911 --> 55:12.009
weren't you, Timmy?

55:12.044 --> 55:13.450
- You're a bitch.

55:13.485 --> 55:14.946
Moving to LA just
made you worse.

55:14.981 --> 55:16.519
- Now I'm a professional bitch.

55:16.554 --> 55:17.850
- Doesn't look like it to me.

55:17.885 --> 55:19.115
You came crawling back home...

55:19.150 --> 55:21.084
You're no better than
the rest of us slugs.

55:21.119 --> 55:24.054
- Do you think it's funny
to terrorize farmworkers?

55:24.089 --> 55:25.627
Got a thing for dead skunks?

55:25.662 --> 55:26.529
- Smell better than you.

55:29.633 --> 55:30.929
- Tough guy, huh?

55:30.964 --> 55:32.502
Remember that I
once broke your arm?

55:32.537 --> 55:33.701
I can do it again.

55:33.736 --> 55:36.066
Out with it, what's
with the skunks?

55:36.101 --> 55:36.968
- Well, it was pretty funny.

55:37.003 --> 55:37.969
- Hilarious.

55:39.445 --> 55:40.741
- Good money too.

55:40.776 --> 55:42.413
- What?

55:54.185 --> 55:55.855
- Shit!

55:55.890 --> 55:57.428
I'm supposed to go out tonight.

55:57.463 --> 55:58.187
- Who's the lucky lady?

55:58.222 --> 56:00.596
- Okay, okay.

56:00.631 --> 56:02.631
Look, that pretty Mexican girl

56:02.666 --> 56:05.469
paid me 100 bucks every time
I messed with the wetbacks.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.099
Are you surprised it was her?

56:09.134 --> 56:12.740
See, girls can do
anything these days.

56:12.775 --> 56:14.478
- Did she say why?

56:14.513 --> 56:16.007
- She didn't say nothing.

56:16.042 --> 56:18.449
Keep my mouth shut
and get creative.

56:18.484 --> 56:19.483
- You're an artist.

56:19.518 --> 56:21.144
Did you set that fire too?

56:21.179 --> 56:22.013
- No.

56:24.655 --> 56:25.522
Shit, no!

56:25.557 --> 56:26.556
Are you kidding me?

56:26.591 --> 56:27.887
I'm from here.

56:27.922 --> 56:29.086
Look I'd never do
something so stupid

56:29.121 --> 56:30.461
as starting a fire
in dry season.

56:30.496 --> 56:31.858
My mom lives next door.

56:34.258 --> 56:36.995
- Fine, I should call the cops.

56:37.030 --> 56:38.931
- Good luck getting
them down here for me.

56:44.906 --> 56:49.447
- Don't ever mess with the
workers or my car ever again.

56:50.241 --> 56:52.450
I still know everyone
in this town, got it?

57:07.764 --> 57:08.928
Juana?

57:08.963 --> 57:11.260
Oh, hi Marcos.

57:11.295 --> 57:12.536
Hey, listen, I found
out who was doing

57:12.571 --> 57:14.538
all that stuff at the motel,

57:14.573 --> 57:16.606
a little chickenshit
named Timothy Fitnall.

57:17.840 --> 57:19.235
Yeah, from the neighborhood.

57:20.612 --> 57:22.810
Anyway, you guys can
rest easy tonight.

57:22.845 --> 57:26.649
No, don't thank me,
just get some sleep.

57:51.775 --> 57:52.576
Juana?

58:35.346 --> 58:37.247
- Oh Marcos, I'm sorry.

58:37.282 --> 58:38.314
- That son of a bitch.

58:38.349 --> 58:40.657
He needs to be
locked up for this.

58:40.692 --> 58:43.792
- Yeah, well I called the
chief on my way over here

58:43.827 --> 58:48.698
and he says his nephew,
Timothy, must've been provoked.

58:48.733 --> 58:50.634
They're not gonna
do a damn thing.

58:59.271 --> 59:00.138
It's a sin.

59:01.141 --> 59:03.075
- The workers are not safe.

59:03.110 --> 59:04.582
- And whose fault is that?

59:10.414 --> 59:12.722
- Brought you some
coffee with your sugar.

59:12.757 --> 59:13.591
- Oh thanks.

59:17.322 --> 59:19.157
Where'd you get that?

59:19.192 --> 59:20.763
- The fire.

59:20.798 --> 59:22.325
Have you really heard
from her, Arthur,

59:22.360 --> 59:23.799
or are you lying again?

59:26.265 --> 59:28.133
You know Dulce worked
for the Vicuñas?

59:28.168 --> 59:28.969
- What?

59:30.104 --> 59:32.401
- Mariela
wants me to find her.

59:32.436 --> 59:34.843
- Well I see you've
finally met Mariela, huh?

59:34.878 --> 59:37.307
- Yes, I had that
distinct pleasure.

59:37.342 --> 59:39.177
- She thinks it's
all hers, you know?

59:39.212 --> 59:40.046
Everything.

59:42.215 --> 59:43.852
- Do you know where Dulce is?

59:46.285 --> 59:47.691
- No.

1:00:02.774 --> 1:00:04.103
- Getting to be a
real pain, Alejandro.

1:00:04.138 --> 1:00:07.073
- Please, nobody calls me
that except for my mother.

1:00:07.108 --> 1:00:08.811
- Well, she's a peach.

1:00:08.846 --> 1:00:09.878
Is that her?

1:00:11.442 --> 1:00:14.751
- Have you heard
anything about Dulce?

1:00:14.786 --> 1:00:16.313
- What, your little stooge?

1:00:16.348 --> 1:00:17.314
Not yet.

1:00:17.349 --> 1:00:19.415
- What do you mean, my stooge?

1:00:19.450 --> 1:00:21.725
- Oh, you know how she
was paying angry locals

1:00:21.760 --> 1:00:23.760
to harass Arthur's pickers.

1:00:23.795 --> 1:00:25.190
Last night, one of them
beat my friend so bad

1:00:25.225 --> 1:00:26.862
he ended up in the hospital.

1:00:26.897 --> 1:00:29.997
Must've gotten a nice, pretty
bonus for that kind of blood.

1:00:30.032 --> 1:00:31.130
- That can't be true.

1:00:31.165 --> 1:00:32.428
I don't know
anything about that.

1:00:32.463 --> 1:00:34.771
- You don't know much, do you?

1:00:34.806 --> 1:00:36.234
- It's my mother, she-

1:00:37.468 --> 1:00:38.874
- Believes this land is hers,

1:00:38.909 --> 1:00:40.711
ancient feud, yada, yada.

1:00:41.912 --> 1:00:43.340
- I wouldn't exactly call
wholesale theft of native land

1:00:43.375 --> 1:00:44.176
a feud.

1:00:45.751 --> 1:00:47.685
- Yeah, you're right.

1:00:49.183 --> 1:00:51.722
But does that justify her
paying for felony assault

1:00:51.757 --> 1:00:52.723
on farmworkers?

1:00:54.122 --> 1:00:55.759
That's a cute trick sending
a sweet girl like Dulce.

1:00:55.794 --> 1:00:57.761
No one's gonna
suspect her, right?

1:00:57.796 --> 1:01:00.258
- She just does whatever
Mariela tells her.

1:01:00.293 --> 1:01:01.864
- Well there must be
something in the water

1:01:01.899 --> 1:01:04.328
over there at your
place, Vicuña.

1:01:04.363 --> 1:01:06.132
- I don't do
everything she says.

1:01:07.399 --> 1:01:08.904
- Okay.

1:01:08.939 --> 1:01:11.236
All right, you're a big
boy, a free thinker.

1:01:11.271 --> 1:01:12.336
- Yes.

1:01:12.371 --> 1:01:14.173
- So why do you lie for her?

1:01:17.244 --> 1:01:19.145
- Some lies are necessary.

1:01:20.181 --> 1:01:21.818
- Is that what she tells you?

1:01:24.218 --> 1:01:25.316
And you believe her?

1:01:27.155 --> 1:01:28.759
- I thought I did.

1:01:33.931 --> 1:01:34.765
Where's Dulce?

1:01:37.330 --> 1:01:38.164
- I don't know.

1:01:42.874 --> 1:01:45.171
- Well if you find anything
out, hear anything,

1:01:45.206 --> 1:01:46.469
could you please call me?

1:02:01.519 --> 1:02:02.958
- Back again?

1:02:02.993 --> 1:02:04.894
- Is everyone still gone?

1:02:04.929 --> 1:02:06.522
- Fire's still raging.

1:02:06.557 --> 1:02:07.457
- And what about
East Palm Court?

1:02:07.492 --> 1:02:09.063
They found a body?

1:02:09.098 --> 1:02:11.065
- You bet, big fella.

1:02:11.100 --> 1:02:12.902
- You mean it was a man?

1:02:12.937 --> 1:02:15.069
- Sure was, bad teeth.

1:02:56.607 --> 1:02:58.915
- Hey, you seen George lately?

1:02:58.950 --> 1:03:00.180
- Not for a few days.

1:03:00.215 --> 1:03:01.181
- How long exactly?

1:03:02.382 --> 1:03:04.481
- Monday, no Sunday.

1:03:04.516 --> 1:03:05.889
- You know where he sleeps?

1:03:05.924 --> 1:03:07.385
- Abandoned buildings mostly,

1:03:07.420 --> 1:03:08.892
said he found a
new place recently,

1:03:08.927 --> 1:03:10.025
it was under construction.

1:03:11.226 --> 1:03:12.896
What are you trying
to do here, Sloane?

1:03:12.931 --> 1:03:16.900
Look, you are number one on the
chief's shit list right now,

1:03:16.935 --> 1:03:17.734
I'm not supposed to help you,

1:03:17.769 --> 1:03:19.100
I'm not even supposed
to talk to you.

1:03:19.135 --> 1:03:20.563
- I wish you'd seen
Marcos last night.

1:03:20.598 --> 1:03:22.136
He's lucky he lived
to tell the tale.

1:03:22.171 --> 1:03:23.071
- Keep your voice down.

1:03:23.106 --> 1:03:24.336
- Why, what's going on in there?

1:03:24.371 --> 1:03:26.877
Why was your chief so
chummy with Alejandro?

1:03:30.509 --> 1:03:32.883
Mariela owns the police.

1:03:34.051 --> 1:03:35.347
- What are you doing here?

1:03:36.955 --> 1:03:40.616
- Remember that little arson
you all forgot to solve?

1:03:40.651 --> 1:03:42.992
I think the body was George.

1:03:43.027 --> 1:03:45.621
- No. Shit.

1:03:45.656 --> 1:03:48.459
- Yeah cow shit and sour grapes.

1:03:48.494 --> 1:03:50.494
You need to arrest
Timothy Fitnall.

1:03:51.695 --> 1:03:54.201
- You've got to get
outta here, Sloane.

1:03:54.236 --> 1:03:56.005
I don't think you
can win this one.

1:03:58.669 --> 1:04:00.878
- Well, neither can she.

1:04:19.030 --> 1:04:20.964
Juana, are you packing?

1:04:24.035 --> 1:04:24.627
- What?

1:04:36.443 --> 1:04:37.277
- No.

1:06:32.823 --> 1:06:33.822
- Here's your food.

1:06:33.857 --> 1:06:34.756
- What's wrong?

1:06:34.792 --> 1:06:36.330
- You must
think I'm pretty stupid.

1:06:36.365 --> 1:06:38.266
- What are
you talking about?

1:06:38.301 --> 1:06:40.136
- Well, I'm
done protecting you.

1:06:40.171 --> 1:06:41.037
- What do you mean?

1:06:41.072 --> 1:06:42.369
- I mean I
called your patrona.

1:06:42.404 --> 1:06:43.568
- Mariela?

1:06:43.603 --> 1:06:44.404
- Goodbye.

1:06:44.439 --> 1:06:45.669
- No Arthur, please.

1:06:45.704 --> 1:06:50.707
Please, help me get
away from here, please.

1:07:14.337 --> 1:07:15.171
- Talk.

1:07:19.408 --> 1:07:21.177
- We had a plan.

1:07:21.212 --> 1:07:22.145
- You and?

1:07:22.180 --> 1:07:23.575
- Mariela.

1:07:23.610 --> 1:07:27.315
It was her idea to
harass the workers.

1:07:27.350 --> 1:07:28.877
- How could you do that?

1:07:28.912 --> 1:07:31.715
- It's easier to scare them
than to pay them more money.

1:07:33.191 --> 1:07:35.092
- That reminds me,

1:07:36.755 --> 1:07:38.689
you owe me a couple
of spare tires.

1:07:43.729 --> 1:07:45.696
- I did it for my daughter.

1:07:47.271 --> 1:07:48.270
- Your daughter?

1:07:51.209 --> 1:07:52.901
Well, where's she?

1:07:52.936 --> 1:07:54.540
- I don't know.

1:07:54.575 --> 1:07:59.215
Mariela, she took her away.

1:07:59.250 --> 1:08:00.447
- And why is that?

1:08:04.387 --> 1:08:08.719
- It was her husband's
baby... with me.

1:08:11.262 --> 1:08:13.592
So she said the baby
should have been hers.

1:08:15.233 --> 1:08:18.300
But she is flesh of my
flesh, she is everything.

1:08:18.335 --> 1:08:19.101
- Okay so...

1:08:22.438 --> 1:08:23.338
So Mariela kicked
her husband out

1:08:23.373 --> 1:08:25.670
and she took your kid?

1:08:25.705 --> 1:08:28.673
- Told me I had to help
her get Arthur's land.

1:08:28.708 --> 1:08:31.346
And when I told her I
was sick of it, she said

1:08:32.514 --> 1:08:35.152
if I burned down
Arthur's building,

1:08:36.287 --> 1:08:38.881
I could have my baby back.

1:08:38.916 --> 1:08:43.919
And instead she sent her
sicario with a gun to kill me.

1:08:44.790 --> 1:08:47.527
So I escaped back to Arthur.

1:08:48.695 --> 1:08:49.496
- Arthur.

1:08:51.302 --> 1:08:54.303
- I told him I was being
stalked by a boyfriend

1:08:55.735 --> 1:08:57.207
so he helped me hide out here.

1:08:59.475 --> 1:09:04.445
He told me about your mom, how
beautiful and smart she was.

1:09:06.482 --> 1:09:08.548
- Yeah well, here we are.

1:09:10.915 --> 1:09:12.189
- Forgive her.

1:09:13.423 --> 1:09:14.686
Forgive yourself.

1:09:15.887 --> 1:09:18.261
- And why should I take
advice from an arsonist?

1:09:19.759 --> 1:09:21.330
- I never hurt anyone.

1:09:22.861 --> 1:09:24.597
I just wanted my baby back.

1:09:26.029 --> 1:09:27.270
- Except George.

1:09:27.998 --> 1:09:29.239
- Who?

1:09:29.868 --> 1:09:31.208
- In the fire.

1:09:35.940 --> 1:09:37.214
- It was empty.

1:09:38.646 --> 1:09:39.480
- No.

1:09:44.883 --> 1:09:46.223
- Oh my God.

1:09:50.328 --> 1:09:52.295
- Hey, stop it!

1:09:53.991 --> 1:09:56.024
How is this better
for your child?

1:10:03.737 --> 1:10:06.936
- You can't just decide
not to be a mother!

1:10:20.853 --> 1:10:23.260
- You don't know what
Mariela is capable of.

1:10:24.362 --> 1:10:25.394
- Well, you better hurry.

1:10:27.365 --> 1:10:28.529
Come on, go get your stuff.

1:11:36.500 --> 1:11:37.928
- You've
reached Arthur Stendhal.

1:11:37.963 --> 1:11:39.864
Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

1:12:03.186 --> 1:12:04.427
- Sloane.

1:12:06.794 --> 1:12:07.628
Oh Jesus.

1:12:08.796 --> 1:12:10.598
- Somebody took Dulce.

1:12:10.633 --> 1:12:11.533
He's a big guy,

1:12:11.568 --> 1:12:12.765
I've seen him somewhere before.

1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:15.504
- It must've been
Cuco, by mom's muscle.

1:12:16.540 --> 1:12:18.408
- Sleeps on the job.

1:12:18.443 --> 1:12:20.641
- Sloane, I can't believe
that she did this to you.

1:12:20.676 --> 1:12:21.576
- Well believe it.

1:12:23.448 --> 1:12:24.414
- Dulce's back at our place.

1:12:24.449 --> 1:12:25.712
She's contrite as all hell.

1:12:25.747 --> 1:12:27.549
Mariela won't say a word to her.

1:12:28.783 --> 1:12:30.684
Shit, if I had known that
she was hiding out here-

1:12:30.719 --> 1:12:32.180
- What would you have done?

1:12:32.215 --> 1:12:34.457
- Where you trying to help her
get her or back for Mariela?

1:12:37.594 --> 1:12:39.924
- I thought Dulce
was a homewrecker,

1:12:41.191 --> 1:12:43.191
sleeping with my stepdad and
breaking up my happy family.

1:12:43.226 --> 1:12:44.259
- Dulce's a child.

1:12:44.294 --> 1:12:47.767
She was eaten alive by
this happy family of yours

1:12:47.802 --> 1:12:50.638
and now Mariela's
holding her baby hostage.

1:12:50.673 --> 1:12:52.409
- Sloane, I made a mistake.

1:12:54.204 --> 1:12:55.445
I'm not like her.

1:12:57.108 --> 1:12:57.942
- I know.

1:12:59.242 --> 1:13:00.549
- I need to fix this.

1:13:02.080 --> 1:13:04.080
- We have to find that baby.

1:13:04.115 --> 1:13:08.216
♪ Oh I wonder
who's buying the wine ♪

1:13:08.251 --> 1:13:13.463
♪ For lips that I
used to call mine ♪

1:13:15.500 --> 1:13:19.964
♪ And I wonder if she
ever tells him of me ♪

1:13:22.771 --> 1:13:27.774
- 1978, the year I took
over my grandaddy's farm,

1:13:29.547 --> 1:13:33.516
also my first vintage. And
this is the last bottle.

1:13:34.981 --> 1:13:39.489
I was saving it for the day
I retired but what the hell?

1:13:39.524 --> 1:13:43.856
Grapes rotting on the
vines, houses on fire.

1:13:48.291 --> 1:13:49.224
- Arthur.

1:13:49.259 --> 1:13:50.962
- What is it, Sloane?

1:13:51.833 --> 1:13:53.030
Gonna give me another one

1:13:53.065 --> 1:13:55.164
of your trademark
withering looks?

1:13:56.541 --> 1:13:57.540
- We need your help.

1:13:57.575 --> 1:13:58.739
- You and?

1:13:58.774 --> 1:14:01.038
- I'm Alejandro Vicuña,

1:14:01.073 --> 1:14:03.073
but most everyone calls me Tico.

1:14:05.682 --> 1:14:08.078
- Get off my land, Alejandro.

1:14:08.113 --> 1:14:09.981
- Arthur, he's with us.

1:14:11.556 --> 1:14:13.116
Can we talk about Dulce?

1:14:13.151 --> 1:14:15.283
Mariela took her kid
and now she's holding it

1:14:15.318 --> 1:14:17.527
like some sick ransom.

1:14:17.562 --> 1:14:18.561
We need to help her.

1:14:20.158 --> 1:14:21.564
- I'm tired, Sloane.

1:14:22.292 --> 1:14:23.500
- It's her child.

1:14:24.932 --> 1:14:26.635
- Yeah, why don't you get
the police to do something?

1:14:26.670 --> 1:14:28.670
- They're dirty, you know that.

1:14:28.705 --> 1:14:29.337
- I'm tired.

1:14:31.741 --> 1:14:34.170
- It's just grape juice, Arthur.

1:14:34.205 --> 1:14:35.512
- No, you're wrong there.

1:14:36.614 --> 1:14:38.273
It's earth and sand and water.

1:14:38.308 --> 1:14:39.615
It's poetry in a bottle.

1:14:39.650 --> 1:14:41.782
- It's grape juice.

1:14:41.817 --> 1:14:44.686
Is it worth separating
another mother from her child,

1:14:44.721 --> 1:14:47.183
getting innocent people
beaten up and worse?

1:14:47.218 --> 1:14:49.284
Is it worth holding
my mom hostage?

1:14:49.319 --> 1:14:50.659
- That's not fair.

1:14:50.694 --> 1:14:52.661
- You could have
taken her to Tuscany.

1:14:52.696 --> 1:14:54.828
You could have
taken her anywhere.

1:14:56.997 --> 1:14:58.931
- She gave me a life.

1:15:00.638 --> 1:15:01.637
She gave me you.

1:15:03.168 --> 1:15:04.772
This land's all I've ever known.

1:15:06.072 --> 1:15:08.842
But maybe it's not a
blessing, maybe it's a curse.

1:15:12.276 --> 1:15:14.012
Why don't you get
out, Sloane, huh?

1:15:14.916 --> 1:15:16.014
Get out while you can.

1:15:20.284 --> 1:15:21.250
- I'm here now.

1:15:24.662 --> 1:15:25.287
- All right.

1:16:01.765 --> 1:16:02.564
- You go in first
and don't let on-

1:16:02.599 --> 1:16:04.128
- Never seen you
before in my life.

1:16:04.163 --> 1:16:05.195
- Exactly.

1:16:05.230 --> 1:16:06.636
- Find Dulce.

1:16:06.671 --> 1:16:07.263
- I will.

1:16:09.135 --> 1:16:10.101
- What's your plan?

1:16:11.302 --> 1:16:14.171
- We're adults, it's
time to act like it.

1:16:25.118 --> 1:16:26.689
Nicely done.

1:16:26.724 --> 1:16:27.756
Very clever.

1:16:28.692 --> 1:16:30.418
Stole my harvest right
out from under me.

1:16:33.698 --> 1:16:35.291
- You are
hurting innocent people.

1:16:36.393 --> 1:16:37.227
- Am I?

1:16:38.131 --> 1:16:39.130
- Where's the child?

1:16:40.430 --> 1:16:42.067
- What child?

1:16:42.102 --> 1:16:44.267
- Don't play games
with me, Dulce's child.

1:16:50.341 --> 1:16:52.682
- Arthur, there
never was a child.

1:16:52.717 --> 1:16:55.047
It was a still birth.

1:16:55.082 --> 1:16:59.689
Poor girl went half
crazy with grief.

1:16:59.724 --> 1:17:01.955
- Just let the child go, please.

1:17:05.730 --> 1:17:06.927
And you can have it all.

1:17:09.228 --> 1:17:10.799
- Tell me,

1:17:10.834 --> 1:17:15.837
tell me what we've longed
to hear for 100 years.

1:17:18.908 --> 1:17:22.041
- You can have the
whole rotting valley.

1:17:26.850 --> 1:17:30.984
- Arthur, there
never was a child,

1:17:32.790 --> 1:17:35.758
just a very, very sick girl.

1:17:36.893 --> 1:17:38.959
She's so manipulative.

1:17:39.995 --> 1:17:42.732
Weak old men are her specialty.

1:17:44.835 --> 1:17:48.738
Now what were you saying
about that precious vineyard?

1:17:57.947 --> 1:17:59.012
- What is that?

1:18:00.345 --> 1:18:02.884
- Cries all night.

1:18:02.919 --> 1:18:04.512
- What? Who?

1:18:04.547 --> 1:18:05.887
- Must miss her mother.

1:18:06.549 --> 1:18:08.021
Can't sleep.

1:18:08.056 --> 1:18:09.484
- Where is she?

1:18:09.519 --> 1:18:10.859
- So much crying.

1:18:12.159 --> 1:18:15.864
Someone should
really shut her up.

1:20:46.445 --> 1:20:47.279
- Sloane.

1:20:53.617 --> 1:20:55.617
- Look Dulce, I found her.

1:20:57.291 --> 1:20:59.027
What's wrong with her?

1:20:59.062 --> 1:21:01.997
- Mariela gave me
something for the pain.

1:21:03.594 --> 1:21:04.901
- We got to get out of here.

1:21:07.136 --> 1:21:09.939
- She told me my baby was dead.

1:21:09.974 --> 1:21:11.006
- She's right here.

1:21:42.765 --> 1:21:45.469
- Give me back my child.

1:21:45.504 --> 1:21:46.734
Damela!

1:21:46.769 --> 1:21:48.109
Alejandro?

1:21:48.144 --> 1:21:50.309
We are a family.

1:21:50.344 --> 1:21:51.310
This is your fight.

1:21:53.644 --> 1:21:54.445
- No, they're my fight,

1:21:54.480 --> 1:21:56.117
not you or this land.

1:21:57.483 --> 1:21:59.252
- What have I always taught you?

1:22:00.090 --> 1:22:01.419
- Violence.

1:22:01.454 --> 1:22:03.091
- Mariela, please.

1:22:03.126 --> 1:22:06.754
- You and your family have sunk
your teeth into stolen land

1:22:06.789 --> 1:22:09.361
for too many generations.

1:22:09.396 --> 1:22:11.066
You taught me to fight dirty

1:22:11.101 --> 1:22:15.037
and I will fight until
I can no longer breathe.

1:22:20.044 --> 1:22:21.736
- Let's go.

1:22:26.149 --> 1:22:27.049
- Get them.

1:22:31.748 --> 1:22:33.385
- I'm right behind you.

1:22:49.370 --> 1:22:50.633
- Where's Arthur?

1:22:50.668 --> 1:22:51.469
I need to find him.

1:22:51.504 --> 1:22:58.476
I think he's hurt.
