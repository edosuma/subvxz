02:00.633 --> 02:03.167
Says he's very proud
of himself.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.600
He was pursued by
the Coast Guard.

02:05.633 --> 02:08.767
Says he was
very cool,
very smart,

02:08.800 --> 02:12.433
very careful not to
dump the merchandise
in deep water,

02:12.467 --> 02:14.867
but waited
till they were
over the reef

02:14.900 --> 02:18.533
and took great pains
to make sure
the cargo was not seen.

02:19.233 --> 02:21.100
We have
the coordinates.

02:21.133 --> 02:24.200
That's nice.
But here's
the problem.

02:24.233 --> 02:29.267
I have a very important
customer that has spent
a very large sum of money

02:29.300 --> 02:32.667
for merchandise
which I now
cannot deliver on time.

02:32.700 --> 02:36.500
Dumping the cargo
was not part
of our contract.

02:36.533 --> 02:40.967
So, I'm thinking maybe
you and I should
renegotiate our deal.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.067
Good. Pay the man
what I feel
he's owed.

02:50.900 --> 02:52.767
The others?
Already done.

02:52.800 --> 02:55.333
Get rid of the boat
and the bodies.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.567
Here you go.
Thank you.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.100
Mmm-hmm.

05:16.133 --> 05:17.867
You sure you don't
wanna get dive certified
while you're here?

05:17.900 --> 05:20.500
No, I'm sure.
Sounds like
too much work.

05:20.533 --> 05:23.033
I'm just here
to relax.

05:23.067 --> 05:25.267
What exactly is it
that you do
in the real world?

05:25.300 --> 05:27.600
Actually,
I'm a heart surgeon.

05:28.633 --> 05:29.667
Wow.

05:29.700 --> 05:32.167
I'm just kidding,
I'm a model.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.433
Mostly print ads,
couple of commercials.

05:34.467 --> 05:37.367
When I get a break,
I just need
some open space.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.300
Well, we got
plenty of that.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.100
That's for sure.

05:41.133 --> 05:44.100
You know, Sebastian always
says we don't make as much
money as some people,

05:44.133 --> 05:46.667
but we've got
one hell of an office.

05:48.133 --> 05:50.867
Of course,
this is all
just temporary.

05:50.900 --> 05:54.167
I mean, we've got
bigger plans
for down the road.

05:54.200 --> 05:57.967
Whatever the case,
I think you guys have it
pretty great out here.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.200
I mean, I look around
and it's like heaven,

Well, you have to admit,
you've got a sexy boss.

07:00.133 --> 07:01.467
Right?

07:04.633 --> 07:05.800
True.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.800
And the dress code
is liberal.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.033
That's true.

07:17.300 --> 07:20.633
And the health benefits
are pretty good.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.600
I feel like I'm being
sexually harassed.

07:26.800 --> 07:27.900

Kimi didn't say much
of anything. Kimi is,
uh, still sleeping.

09:52.500 --> 09:53.867
What are you
gonna tell her?

09:53.900 --> 09:57.100
We are going to tell her
that I slept on the couch.

09:57.133 --> 09:59.667
And being the nice and kind
and thoughtful person I am,

09:59.700 --> 10:02.100
didn't wanna disturb her
and got
an early start. Yeah?

10:02.133 --> 10:03.367
Yeah.
Yeah.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.467
And what
really happened?

10:04.500 --> 10:06.200
Nothing happened.

Technically,
nothing happened.

10:10.467 --> 10:13.333
Then you got nothing
to worry about, do you?

10:15.233 --> 10:18.867
Now, if you have to know,
I was at the bar last night.

10:18.900 --> 10:21.200
I was having a few beers
and I was
waiting for Kimi.

10:21.233 --> 10:23.600

my own business,
okay?

that I took surfing
this weekend came...

here we go.

you have to be polite
and nice to the client.

And I'm telling you,
nothing happened.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.100
So, anyway, one of
these girls, she asked me
if I wanted to dance.

10:36.133 --> 10:37.667
And what was I gonna say?
Was I gonna say no?

10:37.700 --> 10:41.100
Could have, yeah.
"No" falls within
even your vocabulary.

10:41.133 --> 10:44.867
Well, I did not say no
because I am
a gentleman, okay?

10:44.900 --> 10:47.367
So, anyway,
I'm out on the dance floor
with this girl.

It's hot in there.

all down my chest,

and this Parvati girl,
she just starts
licking it,

10:58.133 --> 11:00.767
licking it off of my chest,
right there in the middle
of the dance floor.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.500
I hate it when that happens.
Hate it when that happens.

11:02.533 --> 11:04.033
And then,
perfect timing. Ha!

caressing your manly pecs.

So what did
Kimi do?

11:12.667 --> 11:15.033
Well, that's just the thing.
I mean, Kimi,
she didn't do anything.

11:15.067 --> 11:16.967
She came and she saw.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.667
She didn't say anything,
she didn't do anything.

11:18.700 --> 11:22.167

and looked and...

Then why is this
freaking you out?

What do you mean,
why is that
freaking me out?

You just let me know.

licking rum off your chest...

gonna do?

never happen.

to talk to if we want
to dive the North Reef.

We were looking
to hire someone privately
for the week.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.200
A week?

12:49.300 --> 12:50.367
Uh, let me see.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.433
We'll have to, uh...

12:51.467 --> 12:52.833
We might have to
rearrange some stuff.

12:52.867 --> 12:54.500
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, let me
flip through
the schedule here.

12:54.533 --> 12:57.833
You usually have to book
a little further in advance.

12:57.867 --> 13:01.433
Yeah, we could do a week.
What kind of diving
you looking to do?

13:01.467 --> 13:03.200
Reef diving?
Wall diving?

13:03.233 --> 13:04.633
Perhaps a bit
of both.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.467
The truth is,
I'm looking
for something.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.167
The San Cristobal.

13:08.200 --> 13:09.367
(LAUGHS)

13:09.400 --> 13:10.433

He's practically
obsessed with it.

13:14.333 --> 13:15.800
We've been poking
around in the sand,

13:15.833 --> 13:17.700
looking for that
for four years.
There's nothing down there.

13:17.733 --> 13:19.800
Maybe you've been looking
in the wrong place.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.100
Or maybe
it's just a legend.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.100
Oh, no, it's more
than a legend, sir.

13:23.133 --> 13:25.433
The San Cristobal
was one of the largest
ships of its age.

13:25.467 --> 13:26.500
Over 2,000 tons
and...

I know the story.

Left Acapulco in 1623,
headed to
the Philippines.

13:30.800 --> 13:35.800

of ivory, jewels,
Spanish doubloons.

13:35.833 --> 13:38.367
Just like this one.

about a year ago
off the North Reef.

13:41.533 --> 13:44.000
Well, clearly my information
was correct.

We won't know till
we get it in a solution and
dissolve all the crud off.

16:27.800 --> 16:32.467
But it could be...
I don't know, part of
a sword or scepter.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.367
You think
it's from
San Cristobal?

16:36.400 --> 16:37.567
Doubtful.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.167
Well, whatever it is,
hopefully
we can use it.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.367
We wanna furnish our
Someday Boat with things
entirely from under the sea.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.800
Your "Someday Boat"?

16:48.800 --> 16:51.167
I'm impressed.

16:51.200 --> 16:55.000
You've got it down
to the bolts and
the wiring, haven't you?

CARLTON: Now, these
revolved sections,

16:57.000 --> 16:58.367

aren't they?

You know design?

16:59.633 --> 17:02.167
I took a few courses
in my day, yeah.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.967
But this, this is
goddamn beautiful.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.567
You really did this
all yourself?

17:06.599 --> 17:08.500
Every inch.

17:08.532 --> 17:11.166
Ever since I was a kid,
I wanted to make boats.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.599
I worked for
some yacht maker
on the mainland,

17:13.633 --> 17:15.200
but it didn't take
me long to realize

17:15.233 --> 17:18.433
I didn't wanna spend
the rest of my life making
someone else's dreams.

17:18.467 --> 17:20.267
That's what
it's all about,
isn't it?

17:20.300 --> 17:23.633
Having a dream
and chasing it
any way you can?

17:23.666 --> 17:27.267
I guess. It gets hard
sometimes, though,
you know?

17:27.300 --> 17:30.767
I mean, this is a great gig,
but none of it's ours.

17:30.800 --> 17:34.767
This equipment,
it's all leased.
We're in it up to here.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.833
But we have
the dream, right?

17:36.867 --> 17:39.167
The San Cristobal?

17:39.200 --> 17:43.000
Sure, that's one way.
I wouldn't
rule out any others.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.433
No, of course not.

17:45.467 --> 17:47.700
So, Azra and I
were wondering

17:47.733 --> 17:50.967
what you two were doing
for dinner tonight.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Well, we can do
whatever you want.
What are you in the mood for?

17:53.033 --> 17:55.600
We've rented
a little house
up the road.

17:55.633 --> 18:00.067
Why don't you just
come up there?
Our chef will cook.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.300
This is amazing.

Hi.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.367

Thank you.

18:38.833 --> 18:39.967

18:40.000 --> 18:43.433
Azra doesn't drink.
It's a control thing.

18:43.467 --> 18:46.267
Well, we'll make up
for that.

18:46.300 --> 18:48.967
Call me crazy,
but this doesn't suck.

is unbelievable.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.267

So, while you guys
are here, did you wanna
do any night diving?

19:15.800 --> 19:17.200
No.
Good.

19:18.633 --> 19:21.367
I take it you don't
like diving at night.

agree with you more.

I'd like to be able
to see whatever
might want to kill me.

Do you enjoy it?

19:40.300 --> 19:41.833

Yeah, I do.

19:41.867 --> 19:43.433
It doesn't
scare you?

There's nothing wrong
with fear, right?

Fear can keep you alive,
especially underwater.

of his buddies, Mace,

29:55.800 --> 29:58.467
He gets so obedient.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.767
Hey, what's so funny
over here?

30:00.800 --> 30:03.000
Uh, nothing,
just girl talk.

30:03.033 --> 30:05.967
That's cool. My friends
and I are having
a little party later on.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.600
Why don't
you come on by?

30:07.633 --> 30:09.200
You know what?
We're here
with our boyfriends.

30:09.233 --> 30:10.600
Yeah.
So...

30:11.000 --> 30:12.500
Whoa, wait.

30:14.800 --> 30:16.900
She said we have to go.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.800
You are my new hero.

30:29.667 --> 30:32.833
DANI: So, after we dissolved
the sediment from our find,

30:32.867 --> 30:34.833
here's what we got.

30:34.867 --> 30:37.267
It's a Caravaca Cross carried
by the priests of the time.

30:37.300 --> 30:40.000
Now, apparently,
there were chips of wood
from Christ's cross

30:40.033 --> 30:42.167
within each one of them
that gives it powers,

30:42.200 --> 30:43.267
kind of like an amulet.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.100
And the priests
were on the boats,

30:45.133 --> 30:46.633
not just for the spread
of Christianity

30:46.667 --> 30:49.367
but also for good luck
because they were
attacked so frequently.

30:49.400 --> 30:50.767
It's part of the
ship's manifest.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.767
This is the first thing
we have found

30:52.800 --> 30:55.700
that could definitely
have been on
the San Cristobal,

30:55.733 --> 30:57.000
so we need to
go back exactly...

30:57.033 --> 30:59.533
No. We're not
going to do that.

30:59.567 --> 31:00.900
You don't understand.

31:00.933 --> 31:02.967
There's a very specific
area right here,
where we were diving.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.167
The undercurrents...

31:04.200 --> 31:05.500
I said no.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.033
All right,
I'm confused.

31:09.067 --> 31:11.600
You specifically said
when you hired us that
you were searching for the...

31:11.633 --> 31:14.200
San Cristobal.
Yes, I know.

31:15.900 --> 31:17.633
I think we should
tell them.

31:18.467 --> 31:21.033
Tell us what?

31:21.067 --> 31:24.500
Some associates of mine
connected with the
US government were in Iraq,

31:24.533 --> 31:26.467
and they
discovered quite
a sizable portion

31:26.500 --> 31:28.267
of Saddam Hussein's
hidden fortune

31:28.300 --> 31:31.100
in the form of
cash money,
gold and jewelry.

31:31.133 --> 31:32.500
How sizable?

31:32.533 --> 31:34.667
Upwards of
60 million dollars.

31:34.700 --> 31:35.967
Jesus.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.967
Yeah, now, they could
have reported
their findings

31:39.000 --> 31:40.600
to the proper
authorities, but...

31:40.633 --> 31:41.667
DANI:
But they didn't.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.967
No, they came to me.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.067
SEBASTIAN: Why you?

31:45.100 --> 31:47.633
Because Carlton
is known to have
a certain expertise

31:47.667 --> 31:49.833
in moving goods
in and out of places.

31:49.867 --> 31:51.167
He's a smuggler,
you mean.

31:51.200 --> 31:54.267
No, I like to think
of myself as
an importer/exporter.

31:54.300 --> 31:56.167
Smuggler sounds
so low-rent.

31:56.200 --> 31:59.100
These officers managed
to get the merchandise
as far as Hong Kong,

31:59.133 --> 32:01.767
after which they hired
Carlton to bring
it into the States.

32:01.800 --> 32:04.000
First stop was Honolulu,
but while
they were coming in,

32:04.033 --> 32:05.800
they got into
some trouble
with the Coast Guard.

32:05.833 --> 32:07.100
The men
he hired panicked.

32:07.133 --> 32:08.767
And they threw
our containers
overboard.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.967
Somewhere out
by the North Reef.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.500
So that's what
you're really
looking for?

32:12.533 --> 32:14.367
The two
containers, yes.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.367
And if you help us
find those containers...

32:16.400 --> 32:17.667
What are we
paying you again?

32:17.700 --> 32:18.967
Five hundred a day.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.867
Thirty-five hundred
a week.
Tell you what.

32:24.033 --> 32:25.433
You help us find
those containers,

32:25.467 --> 32:27.833
and we will up your fee
to $500,000.

32:29.200 --> 32:31.467
$500,000?

32:35.000 --> 32:36.100
Is this a joke?

32:36.133 --> 32:37.833
No, sir.

32:37.867 --> 32:40.200
What's really
in those containers?

32:40.233 --> 32:41.767
You think it's drugs,
don't you?

32:41.800 --> 32:43.433
Thought had crossed
my mind, yeah.

32:43.467 --> 32:45.700
It isn't drugs.
I promise you.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.133
Tell them the rest of it.
You owe them the truth.

32:51.833 --> 32:54.267
Okay, look.

32:54.300 --> 32:57.500
The $500,000 isn't just
for services rendered,

32:57.533 --> 32:59.467
it's also an apology.

33:01.533 --> 33:04.967
The men who hired Carlton,
they're rather
serious individuals.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.300
They made it quite clear
that if he didn't find their
merchandise within the week,

33:08.333 --> 33:09.767
or if someone
should find it
before him,

33:09.800 --> 33:11.733
then they...
Then I will die.

33:12.833 --> 33:15.033
They will kill me.

33:15.067 --> 33:17.000
It's as plain
and as simple as that.

33:17.033 --> 33:20.200
AZRA: Except it's not
so plain,
nor so simple, is it?

33:20.233 --> 33:21.733
No, it's not.

33:22.867 --> 33:25.633
Look, these men,
they know your names.

33:25.667 --> 33:29.667
They know who you are.
They know
you've been helping me.

33:29.700 --> 33:30.967
So, we're
in danger, too?

33:31.000 --> 33:33.800
Only if we don't
find those containers.

33:47.833 --> 33:49.667
YORKIN: Yo, scuba stud.

33:50.700 --> 33:53.567
Got a complaint
in my office
this morning.

33:53.600 --> 33:56.467
A guy at the club
got a little
roughed up.

33:56.500 --> 34:00.167
Yeah, where were you?
Too busy
busting underage girls?

34:00.200 --> 34:02.600
Very funny.
Anything I need
to worry about?

34:02.633 --> 34:06.767
No, some guy was harassing
one of my clients,
and she took care of it.

34:06.800 --> 34:11.000
Yeah, I heard.
Heard all about it.
You guys doing some diving?

34:11.033 --> 34:12.100
That's right.

34:12.132 --> 34:13.632
Yeah? What kind?

34:13.667 --> 34:15.400
Underwater, mostly.

34:17.132 --> 34:20.167
Sure you're not
out there looking
for something?

34:20.199 --> 34:22.199
Okay, now you're
harassing my clients.

34:22.233 --> 34:23.300
I'm just
doing my job.

34:23.333 --> 34:25.100
Really?
What's the occasion?

34:25.132 --> 34:27.867
Look, Officer,
maybe there's
a misunderstanding.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.600
I'm just doing
some sport diving
with a friend,

34:29.632 --> 34:31.833
and Sebastian's
guiding us.

34:31.867 --> 34:33.567
Who's guiding him?

34:33.600 --> 34:34.699
Sorry?

34:34.733 --> 34:36.033
(LAUGHS)

34:36.067 --> 34:37.567
I'm just kidding,
I'm just kidding.

34:37.600 --> 34:40.433
Actually, he's the best
dive master
on the island, aren't you?

34:40.467 --> 34:41.766
(LAUGHING)

34:41.800 --> 34:43.367
I just like to
give him a hard time.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.000
You're an ass,
you know that,
Yorkin?

34:45.033 --> 34:46.600
Yes, I do.
All right, you guys.
Dani!

34:46.632 --> 34:49.199
Get out of here,
good luck. Hey, Dani.

34:50.300 --> 34:51.632
DANI: Hey, Paul.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.766

(DISTRESS SIGNAL ON RADIO)

35:24.133 --> 35:25.267
What's that?

35:25.300 --> 35:26.633
Sounds like an SOS.

35:33.133 --> 35:35.200
Dani Girl, Dani Girl.
Over.

35:37.400 --> 35:39.433
This is the Dani Girl,
what's the problem? Over.

AVERY ON RADIO:
Be advised, be advised.

35:48.733 --> 35:52.833
I've got Icy Hot
all over my balls
and it feels good. Over.

35:52.867 --> 35:56.267
ON LOUDSPEAKER: I repeat,
Icy Hot on the balls,
it feels good.

35:56.300 --> 35:57.700
Would you like
some, dude?

35:57.733 --> 35:59.333
It's not a toy.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.300
What was that about?

36:07.333 --> 36:08.967
Just Avery
being an asshole.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.033
What's he
doing here?

36:10.067 --> 36:11.433
He's our main competition.
I told you.

36:11.467 --> 36:15.567
Hey, yo, Sebastian,
you want that Icy Hot?

36:15.600 --> 36:17.967
Competition isn't something
we can have right now.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.767
AZRA: Get rid of him.

36:19.800 --> 36:23.000
(SCOFFS) I wish I could.
It doesn't exactly
work that way.

36:23.700 --> 36:25.267
Let me put it this way.

36:25.300 --> 36:27.467
Dipshit over there finds
the containers before we do,

36:27.500 --> 36:29.433
guess who's retiring early
and buying
the nicest new yacht

36:29.467 --> 36:31.600
on the island,
and guess who's not.

36:31.633 --> 36:34.000
If we chase him off,
he'll know
we're onto something.

36:34.033 --> 36:36.800
We'll have Avery
and half the other divers
out here by the afternoon.

36:36.833 --> 36:38.300
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, you don't want that.

36:38.333 --> 36:41.367
Look, he knows
I have a thing for the
San Cristobal, all right?

36:41.400 --> 36:43.767
He mocks me for it.
Let him keep mocking me.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.867
Let him think
I'm taking you on the usual
wild goose chase.

36:45.900 --> 36:49.000
That's how
you get rid of him,
do nothing.

36:50.133 --> 36:53.833
AVERY: It's not that bad
if you put it on
before you shave.

36:53.867 --> 36:54.967
It gets rubbed
in a little bit.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.600
All right.

36:56.633 --> 37:00.100
You don't get that chafed
feeling, you know,
that you got the other day.

37:00.133 --> 37:03.000
You should try it out.
You want to try this out?

37:03.633 --> 37:05.700
No.

37:05.733 --> 37:08.733
Stay on your boat, pal.
I'll be over here.

39:20.667 --> 39:25.100
One down, one to go.
We're halfway home.

39:25.133 --> 39:26.433
DANI: So, what
do you want to do
with this one?

39:26.467 --> 39:28.767
We could go back
and get some
equipment, bring it up.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.867
No, I think it's fine
right where it is.

39:30.900 --> 39:33.367
We'll find the other one,
then we'll bring them
both up together.

39:33.400 --> 39:36.767
Not to bust anyone's bubble,
but the second one
might be harder to find.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.067
Why is that?

39:38.100 --> 39:40.367
You saw where this one
was, right on
the edge of the reef.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.600
If it's off the reef...

39:41.633 --> 39:42.967
Got to dive deeper,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.767
less time underwater,
cover less ground.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.600
No matter,
as long as we find it.

39:48.633 --> 39:51.267
AZRA: We need
both containers.

39:51.300 --> 39:52.833
Whatever you say.

39:52.867 --> 39:55.767
But if we have to dive
over the reef, we have
to refill these tanks,

39:55.800 --> 39:59.267
and it's almost 2:00 now.
We should get
a fresh start tomorrow.

39:59.300 --> 40:01.833
Very well.
Well, then, you're coming
to our house.

40:01.867 --> 40:03.767
Milos will cook
one of
his usual feasts,

40:03.800 --> 40:05.267
and we'll stay relaxed
and stay focused.

40:05.300 --> 40:07.433
No, you know what,
uh, we'd love to,

40:07.467 --> 40:09.667
but we promised Mace and Kimi
we'd go to dinner tonight.

40:09.700 --> 40:12.200
Oh, no problem.
They can come, too.

40:13.833 --> 40:15.133
Perfect.

40:30.300 --> 40:32.967
KIMI: Mace, you are
a total ass!

40:33.000 --> 40:34.633
What about
those messages
from Parvati, huh?

40:34.667 --> 40:36.100
MACE: Jesus, Kimi!
Are you even
listening to yourself,

40:36.133 --> 40:37.433
because you're not
making any sense.

40:37.467 --> 40:38.600
My sense?
I'm not
making sense?

40:38.633 --> 40:40.200
I don't know
what it is

40:40.233 --> 40:42.633
that you want from me.
You wanna figure
stuff out, figure it out,

40:42.667 --> 40:44.200
because I'm frigging
out of here.

40:44.233 --> 40:46.967
Oh, fine, leave!
MACE: Jesus Christ!

40:47.000 --> 40:48.800
MACE: What are you
looking at, old man?

40:49.467 --> 40:54.200
I hate you. I hate...

40:54.233 --> 40:55.367
Kimi, what's wrong?

40:55.400 --> 40:56.467
Well, I'm just
packing his stuff!

40:56.500 --> 40:58.167
I am pissed, okay?

40:58.200 --> 41:01.667
If he wants to leave,
fine, but I am
not taking him back.

41:01.700 --> 41:02.667
(SOFTLY) I'll be...
Yeah.

41:02.700 --> 41:03.767
This is all
his stuff!

41:03.800 --> 41:06.100
He loves to read,
so he can take it with him.

41:06.133 --> 41:07.600
Okay,
what happened?

41:07.633 --> 41:09.867
What happened?

41:09.900 --> 41:11.500
What happened?
Um, let's see.

41:11.533 --> 41:14.567
Text messages
at 1:00 in the morning,
okay? Him flirting...

41:14.600 --> 41:18.067
l have been with him
for four years.
Four years, and...

41:24.233 --> 41:28.067
I'm tired.
Oh, I'm tired.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.300
I, uh...

41:34.000 --> 41:35.800
I put on a good face.

41:36.067 --> 41:37.433
I know.

41:37.467 --> 41:39.467
But I don't know
how long I can do this.

41:39.500 --> 41:42.300
I mean, I don't
need much, but...

41:44.233 --> 41:46.167
I need something.

41:46.200 --> 41:48.233
Listen to me,
Mace loves you.

41:49.300 --> 41:50.367
Okay?

41:50.400 --> 41:52.233
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

41:57.133 --> 41:58.900
It's time to move on.

It's about Kimi,
right?

No thanks, bro.
Kind of all talked out
on that subject.

this time?

43:03.133 --> 43:05.167
What did I do? Thank you.
Thank you, friend,

43:05.200 --> 43:07.700
for immediately jumping
to the conclusion that
it's something that I did.

43:07.733 --> 43:12.100
You know, just so you know,
this was totally
not my fault, all right?

43:12.133 --> 43:13.600
Whose fault was it?

43:13.633 --> 43:15.467
Parvati's fault.

43:15.500 --> 43:17.167
You know, she texted me
yesterday, asking me

43:17.200 --> 43:20.633
when I was gonna come
pick up some surfboard
that Kimi won, and...

43:20.667 --> 43:24.267
I don't know, you know,
"Oh, so good to see you
at the beach," all this stuff.

43:24.300 --> 43:27.100
Yeah, you know, she might
have written
a couple of things that,

43:27.133 --> 43:31.000
if you read them
out of context, they could
have been misunderstood.

43:31.033 --> 43:32.267

going around.

I don't know, I flirt.

I like flirting, so what?
You know, it's no big deal.

43:41.600 --> 43:44.067
Maybe she's getting
fed up with it.

43:48.533 --> 43:52.233
Maybe it has to do
with the fact that
for some crazy reason,

43:54.200 --> 43:55.767
she actually loves you.

43:55.800 --> 43:59.033
Yeah, well,
she's got a funny way
of showing that.

43:59.067 --> 44:01.700

have to learn how
to get along without me,

44:01.733 --> 44:04.367

and for real this time.

finally meet you.

01:03:27.733 --> 01:03:30.167
So, I gotta ask,

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:33.967
what the hell
was she doing out there,
a mile off shore?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.400
No boat.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.967
No boyfriend.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.467
Yeah, I know.

01:03:40.067 --> 01:03:41.200
Um...

01:03:42.633 --> 01:03:44.400
We got into a fight.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:48.267
She got a text message
from some guy,

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.967
and I got jealous
and started
yelling at her,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.867
and next thing I know,
she's running
out the door.

01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:56.133
I guess she must have
gone night diving.

01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:58.167

01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.733

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.767
Hmm?

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.433
Well, if she went
night diving, the boat
that got her out there...

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:07.833
Nothing else
has washed up
except for her.

01:04:07.867 --> 01:04:10.500
And I know she didn't
swim that far.

01:04:10.533 --> 01:04:12.233

I'm the one
who put her here,

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:25.500
so I wanna answer
your questions,
but I can't.

01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:33.000

who was texting her
can help you out.

You know, it's been
a rough morning.

01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:41.200

Yeah.

like this.

alone, okay?

anything at all,
let me know. All right?

I was bullshitting

a story for him.

to the boat.
I'll stay here.
