WEBVTT

00:03.237 --> 00:04.372
Well, you know what?

00:04.372 --> 00:05.673
Since you guys showed up,

00:05.673 --> 00:07.975
nothing's been right
around here.

00:07.975 --> 00:10.311
I got my eye on you.

00:10.311 --> 00:12.012
I know the SEC
is initiating

00:12.012 --> 00:14.982
a fraud investigation
for misleading investors.

00:14.982 --> 00:17.185
$15 million could be
pretty tempting

00:17.185 --> 00:19.653
to somebody
in a financial situation.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.722
I made a mistake, but I thought
it would all be cleared up,

00:21.722 --> 00:22.756
and it will be.

00:22.756 --> 00:23.857
When we get back
into town,

00:23.857 --> 00:25.025
Emily and I
are gonna get a hotel.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.194
I need some space.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.395
Where's the money?

00:27.395 --> 00:28.862
The account's
heavily encrypted.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.532
You fail,
I won't ruin your life.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.033
But Carla and Emily...

00:36.437 --> 00:38.572
I unlocked
Paige's account.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.709
Sheriff's department!

00:43.211 --> 00:45.413
Hands where we can see them.

00:45.413 --> 00:46.747
Who is he?

00:46.747 --> 00:48.416
His name's Walter.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.251
He's your brother.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.885
I hid him away.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.355
I gave him
a safe place to call home.

00:54.355 --> 00:55.956
I protected him!

00:55.956 --> 00:56.890
Where's Paige?

00:58.292 --> 00:59.760
Is she alive?

00:59.760 --> 01:01.295
I killed her.

01:01.295 --> 01:02.563
You have
a beautiful voice.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.703
Paige?

01:09.703 --> 01:11.272
Sunny.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.073
Well, you're
a helluva surprise.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.408
I bet.

01:15.776 --> 01:20.047
I thought you high-tailed it
back to civilization.

01:20.047 --> 01:22.550
I figured you'd be sitting
on a beach somewhere,

01:22.550 --> 01:24.885
sipping a Mai Tai
with your toes in the sand.

01:24.885 --> 01:27.087
You left out the dead part.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.657
- I never thought that--
- What did you think?

01:29.657 --> 01:31.625
I'm just glad you didn't
fall in a ravine

01:31.625 --> 01:33.561
or get eaten up
by a grizzly bear.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.696
Thanks to your son.

01:38.699 --> 01:39.867
Walter.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.337
Walt took you in?

01:44.872 --> 01:47.107
He saved me.

01:47.107 --> 01:50.444
Well, you should know
that Walter's in jail.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.080
He confessed
to murdering you.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.682
Why would he do that?

01:54.682 --> 01:57.084
Yeah, that's the same question
I've been asking myself.

01:57.084 --> 01:59.119
The only thing
I can come up with

01:59.119 --> 02:02.656
is that you tricked him into
sacrificing himself to save you.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.025
He said he could help me
with a little problem I have,

02:05.025 --> 02:07.928
but confessing--
that wasn't part of the plan.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.363
Well, he's still
in jail,

02:09.363 --> 02:12.433
and he'll stay there
until you show yourself.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.134
- Now, let's go.
- First, I need to know

02:14.134 --> 02:15.969
where my bag is.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.638
I know you took it.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.341
I imagine that Sheriff Beau
or that Jenny Hoyt has it.

02:22.576 --> 02:25.213
So, what's so important
about that bag of yours?

02:25.213 --> 02:26.647
There's something in it
I need.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.850
My journal.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.821
That have something to do
with the money you took?

02:35.423 --> 02:38.025
And if it does, I may have
a pretty good idea

02:38.025 --> 02:39.893
who got to it
before the police did.

02:39.893 --> 02:43.130
Help me get it back

02:43.130 --> 02:45.065
and I'll help you
get Walter out.

03:06.454 --> 03:07.855
Ooh.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.257
Fancy food.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.860
Thanks.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.195
I think.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.265
Ooh.

03:17.265 --> 03:19.267
Any idea
what's in this?

03:19.267 --> 03:21.435
No, I don't.
Sorry.

03:21.435 --> 03:24.037
Here goes.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.840
<i>When it comes to me ♪</i>

03:26.840 --> 03:27.741
<i>♪ You can't seem
to concentrate ♪</i>

03:27.741 --> 03:30.611
Tasty.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.112
I'm Mo.

03:32.112 --> 03:34.014
Or Deputy Poppernak
when I'm on duty,

03:34.014 --> 03:36.049
which I'm not, so, Mo.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.519
Natalie.
I'm Skylar's bridesmaid.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.921
- Oh, that's pretty.
- Thank you.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.590
I used to collect stones
when I was a kid.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.692
I had a rock polisher tumbler.

03:44.692 --> 03:45.793
Oh, cool.
It's actually--

03:45.793 --> 03:47.461
It's not stone.

03:47.461 --> 03:48.762
It's, uh, bone.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.531
- Oh.
- Yeah.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.600
Who are you here for?
Bride or the groom?

03:52.600 --> 03:54.968
Bride. Skylar, yeah.
Family friends.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.770
Never met Austin,
but he's a lucky guy.

03:56.770 --> 03:57.805
How about you?

03:57.805 --> 04:00.908
Uh, both, kind of.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.578
Austin and I are actually
working on a project together.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.213
I'm all ears.

04:06.213 --> 04:07.881
Help!
Somebody, help!

04:07.881 --> 04:11.652
Help, somebody!

04:15.889 --> 04:17.391
What happened?
Are you hurt?

04:17.391 --> 04:18.726
- I...
- Sky.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.127
Skylar.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.329
Hey.
It's gonna be okay.

04:21.329 --> 04:23.331
Sky, tell me
what happened.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.633
Austin--
Austin's dead.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.570
Somebody killed him.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.281
Hiya, Walter.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.184
Well, we figured out
your secret.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.055
20 years ago, you murdered
your parents in a house fire.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.163
They weren't my parents.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.368
Ah.
Well, according to this,

05:00.368 --> 05:02.302
there was another kid
in that house.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.171
A little girl
named Meredith.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.274
She was never found.

05:07.274 --> 05:09.042
Did you kill her too?

05:09.042 --> 05:11.679
I was protecting her.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.647
From them.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.784
They hurt her
worse than me.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.819
Where is she now?

05:20.488 --> 05:22.523
I set her free.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.825
You mean you killed her.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.294
It's not what you think.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.229
Well, here's what I think--
I think you killed her

05:29.229 --> 05:31.365
just like you killed Paige,

05:31.365 --> 05:34.468
or "set her free"
in your parlance.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.836
Same damn thing.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.538
Yeah, I know what
you're trying to do.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.540
Do you?

05:39.540 --> 05:41.375
Okay, let's talk
about something else.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.243
You were just a kid
when this happened.

05:43.243 --> 05:44.912
You been out in the woods
all this time?

05:46.079 --> 05:47.848
- Yes.
- Hmm.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.883
So you expect us to believe
that you built that cabin

05:49.883 --> 05:52.352
and you made supply runs
into town

05:52.352 --> 05:54.254
all these years
all by yourself?

05:54.254 --> 05:56.390
Who was helping you,
Walter?

05:56.390 --> 05:58.191
Is it the same person that
helped you hide Paige's body?

05:58.191 --> 06:00.060
Was it Sunny
and Buck Barnes?

06:00.060 --> 06:01.429
We know you were
in Buck's truck.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.263
No. No.
It was just a coincidence.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.567
So you do know
who they are.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.909
Why don't you leave
Sunny out of this?

06:15.909 --> 06:19.079
Okay, well, if Sunny
and Buck are lying

06:19.079 --> 06:21.449
about knowing Walter,
there has to be a reason.

06:21.449 --> 06:22.916
Okay.
What are you thinking?

06:22.916 --> 06:24.785
Maybe Buck's
his accomplice.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.855
Walter did have Mark Woodman's
body in his old truck.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.724
He told us to leave Sunny
out of it.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.292
There has to be
a connection.

06:32.292 --> 06:34.394
Well, right now,
we got nothing concrete,

06:34.394 --> 06:36.564
and Walter is due to be
transferred to County.

06:36.564 --> 06:39.700
So, we need to ask our questions
while we have the time.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.902
The girl that went missing
after the fire, Meredith--

06:41.902 --> 06:43.937
Walter said
he was protecting her.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.906
He said the same thing
about Paige.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.274
Hmm.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.076
You guys,
maybe Paige isn't dead.

06:51.278 --> 06:52.546
We still don't have a body.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.614
That's true.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.248
Just his word.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.150
The more we learn,
the messier this gets.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.252
Yeah, maybe we need to start
from the beginning,

06:59.252 --> 07:00.954
before all the lies.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.322
You want to find
Meredith?

07:02.322 --> 07:03.624
Yeah.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.892
Way ahead of you.
Already ran the name.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.760
Big old pile of nothing.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.996
Then we look harder.

07:10.798 --> 07:11.865
Hey, Pops, what's up?

07:15.302 --> 07:16.937
Okay, sit tight.
I'll be right there.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.338
What's up?

07:18.338 --> 07:19.439
There was a murder
at a wedding.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.474
Come on.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.576
It happened at a ranch
near Birdseye.

07:22.576 --> 07:25.613
Okay. Um...

07:25.613 --> 07:27.615
You good to take it?
I'll stay with Cassie,

07:27.615 --> 07:28.916
'cause clock's ticking
on this Walter thing.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.918
For sure.
I'll let you know if I need you.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.186
So, wait, does this mean you're
Pop's plus-one at a wedding?

07:33.186 --> 07:36.023
Hmm. Jealous?

07:36.023 --> 07:37.157
Yeah.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.626
I want to be
Pop's plus-one.

08:04.417 --> 08:07.187
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.822
You were, uh,
up at the campgrounds.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.991
Yeah, I was.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.392
- What for?
- Oh, just...

08:12.392 --> 08:14.194
tidying up.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.496
Yeah? I thought we paid people
to do that.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.298
Yeah.

08:18.298 --> 08:21.401
Well, you remember you left
your saddles up at the stable?

08:21.401 --> 08:23.003
- Yeah.
- I just swung by there

08:23.003 --> 08:25.205
and picked them up for you,
saved you a trip.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.974
Aww, honey,
that's very sweet of you.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.676
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

08:28.676 --> 08:29.677
You sure that's all?

08:29.677 --> 08:30.878
Yeah. Why?

08:30.878 --> 08:34.047
Well, just checking.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.016
We agreed to put Walter
behind us,

08:36.016 --> 08:38.886
and Paige, too.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.821
Yeah, we did.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.023
Just making sure
we're on the same page.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.058
Okay.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.060
- Come here.
- Mm.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.429
Mm.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.431
Everything's gonna be
just fine.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.072
Just fine.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.351
Victim is
Austin Chambers, 28.

09:11.351 --> 09:15.188
His bride-to-be, Skylar Sharpe,
found the body.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.524
I'm so sorry, Pops.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.593
Were you close
with the bride?

09:19.593 --> 09:21.528
Uh, went to her christening.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.363
Our families
have always been tight.

09:23.363 --> 09:26.199
Especially Eli,
Skylar's father.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.368
Was anyone with her
when she found the body?

09:28.368 --> 09:30.704
Yep.
The wedding photographer.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.773
She and the victim were due
to have a photo session

09:32.773 --> 09:35.475
before the ceremony,
but he didn't show.

09:35.475 --> 09:38.278
Do we have
a time of death?

09:38.278 --> 09:40.113
Crime techs narrowed it down
to the early morning,

09:40.113 --> 09:41.749
sometime before
the wedding guests arrived.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.884
Who had access to the property
during that time?

09:43.884 --> 09:45.753
That would be
the wedding party.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.655
They all stayed overnight
after the rehearsal dinner.

09:47.655 --> 09:50.090
Uh, more than one person
mentioned that

09:50.090 --> 09:52.660
Skylar's dad got into
a big fight with the victim.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.428
Okay, keep
the wedding party here.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.563
Send the rest
of the guests home.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.298
Copy that.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.500
Looks like he was hit
with something sharp.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.103
Crime techs are still looking
for the murder weapon.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.938
What can you tell me
about the victim's family?

10:04.938 --> 10:06.339
Cattle ranchers.

10:06.339 --> 10:07.908
Yeah, this property
actually belongs

10:07.908 --> 10:09.677
to the victim's father,
Mr. Chambers.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.415
Property like this
must be worth a fortune.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.918
I wonder if the victim
and the bride-to-be

10:17.918 --> 10:19.953
- stood to inherit.
- Yeah.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.889
Something tells me this one
ain't gonna be easy.

10:23.556 --> 10:26.526
Weddings never are.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.934
So, we couldn't find anything
on Meredith Levinson

10:33.934 --> 10:36.003
in the system either.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.105
Mm, so you basically did
the same thing

10:38.105 --> 10:40.941
I had a desk jockey do earlier,
with the same results.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.210
Good thing you're not billing
the Sheriff's Department.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.513
You're not billing the
Sheriff's Department, are you?

10:46.513 --> 10:48.015
I wasn't finished,
Bo-Bo.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.183
- Okay.
- Bo-Bo?

10:50.183 --> 10:52.352
Yeah, it's the cringiest
of all time.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.887
It's a harmless term
of endearment.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.689
- Hmm.
- All right?

10:55.689 --> 10:57.490
What do you got,
Denisey-poo?

10:57.490 --> 11:00.560
Well, anyway,
so, unlike your desk jockey,

11:00.560 --> 11:03.163
- we don't give up, do we, Em?
- Nope.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.632
Instead, we're changing course
and looking into the possibility

11:05.632 --> 11:08.969
that Meredith Levinson
might have changed her name.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.304
Oh.
I'm listening.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.406
I mean, it's taking
forever, but--

11:13.406 --> 11:15.675
But you know what they say--
patience is a, uh...

11:15.675 --> 11:17.745
- Virtue.
- No.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.679
It's just an eight-letter
word starts with P.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.983
Oh, no.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.684
Okay, I'm going through
change of name requests

11:24.684 --> 11:26.419
with the state.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.822
Oh, I'm with ya. Okay.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.357
So, what if we back-trace
the name with the birthdate

11:30.357 --> 11:32.793
in the Montana
Vital Statistics?

11:37.064 --> 11:38.866
Um...

11:38.866 --> 11:40.200
Ooh, I think we got her.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.269
Yeah, Meredith Levinson.

11:42.269 --> 11:45.873
She's still alive, except now
she goes by Madeline Lowe.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.875
Nice work, Em.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.377
That's my girl.
That one.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.691
Everything okay?

12:04.691 --> 12:08.095
Yeah, I just keep getting calls
from a blocked number.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.197
Ignore it. Spam.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.866
- Car warranty, condos.
- Maybe.

12:12.866 --> 12:15.602
My mom always calls
from a blocked number.

12:15.602 --> 12:16.636
Answer it, then.

12:18.671 --> 12:20.307
The bride's dad
is waiting.

12:20.307 --> 12:23.343
Let's do this first.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.447
Hey, Eli.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.916
Hey.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.284
This is my partner,
Jenny Hoyt.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.652
Can we make this quick?

12:32.652 --> 12:34.554
I really need to be
with my daughter.

12:34.554 --> 12:37.958
You want to ask me about the
fight with the groom, I suppose?

12:37.958 --> 12:39.893
Can you tell us
what it was about?

12:39.893 --> 12:43.730
All that family
cares about is money.

12:43.730 --> 12:44.832
And you thought
the rehearsal dinner

12:44.832 --> 12:45.966
for your daughter's wedding

12:45.966 --> 12:48.501
was an appropriate time
to bring that up?

12:48.501 --> 12:51.404
The timing choice was theirs,
not mine.

12:51.404 --> 12:52.772
At dinner,
my daughter told me

12:52.772 --> 12:55.508
that Austin made her sign
a last-minute prenup.

12:55.508 --> 12:59.679
So, yes, I approached him
at the rehearsal dinner.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.014
What'd you think
about the wedding

13:01.014 --> 13:02.482
moving forward
after that?

13:02.482 --> 13:06.119
It didn't sit well
with me.

13:06.119 --> 13:09.622
But it was Skylar's choice
to make, not mine.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.459
Bringing two families together
is complicated.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.161
It's only natural you wanted
to protect her.

13:17.730 --> 13:20.167
You don't get it.

13:20.167 --> 13:24.771
After Skylar lost her mother,
she stopped smiling.

13:24.771 --> 13:28.942
Austin was good for her,
despite his family.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.343
She was happy.

13:32.379 --> 13:35.949
So, if you think I was gonna
take that away from her--

13:35.949 --> 13:37.584
not a chance.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.723
I've said my piece,
and that's all.

13:43.723 --> 13:46.994
And for Skylar's sake, you
better find out who did this.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.197
Order up.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.132

14:10.083 --> 14:13.586

14:25.032 --> 14:26.266
That's a lot of money.

14:27.467 --> 14:30.037
Too bad we don't have
Paige's journal.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.071
No deal.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.440
What he means is that

14:33.440 --> 14:36.109

A dinosaur.

How big a specimen
are we talking?

18:00.747 --> 18:02.549
I don't know.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.584
I didn't know about
the dinosaur fossil

18:04.584 --> 18:07.987
until Austin asked me
to sign the prenup.

18:07.987 --> 18:10.123
Did that bother you?

18:10.123 --> 18:12.091

this discovery a secret?

Yeah.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.353

about dinosaurs?

18:40.353 --> 18:41.921
Not much.

18:41.921 --> 18:45.458
He had to ask a friend to help
him figure out what to do.

What can you tell us

19:20.860 --> 19:22.695

19:22.695 --> 19:24.130
Well, we were hoping to talk
to you about a house fire

19:24.130 --> 19:25.164
that happened
20 years ago.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.235
And our condolences.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.502
We know your parents

19:29.502 --> 19:31.671
They weren't my parents.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.340
Right, well, they--
they adopted you,

19:33.340 --> 19:35.508
along with another boy.
Walter?

19:37.677 --> 19:39.746
Why are you asking me
about Walter?

19:39.746 --> 19:42.982
'Cause he's currently in police
custody, on murder charges.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.885
Wow. Okay.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.554
We were hoping you could
shed some light

19:47.554 --> 19:48.921
on what happened
the night of the fire

19:48.921 --> 19:52.124
just so we can understand
who we're dealing with.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.429
Walter set the fire,

19:56.429 --> 19:59.866
but the Walter I know
wasn't a killer.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.768
He was gentle.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.404
Kind, protective.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.005
He killed
your adoptive parents.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.040
You-- You saw him
do that.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.976
Yes, but...

20:12.545 --> 20:14.447
The things that went on
in that house...

20:17.216 --> 20:19.719
We were beaten, starved.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.090
I didn't think it was ever
going to end.

20:24.090 --> 20:27.460
Trust me, he did what he did
so that we could escape.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.462
Where did Walter take you
after the fire?

20:31.831 --> 20:34.701
His birth mother
picked us up.

20:34.701 --> 20:37.036
She told me to change my name
and start fresh.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.371
I haven't looked back.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.440
And what was her name?

20:40.440 --> 20:44.176
I don't remember,
but she sang to us.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.249
Oh, and she had
the most beautiful red hair.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.516
I said I need
more time.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.485

24:37.009 --> 24:39.512
Hello?

24:39.512 --> 24:40.880
Anybody around?

25:16.415 --> 25:18.818
This is private property.
Who are you?

25:18.818 --> 25:20.887
Jenny Hoyt,
Sheriff's Department.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.054
Who are you?

25:23.856 --> 25:25.491
I'm Carson Price.

25:25.491 --> 25:26.826
Oh.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.327
You're Austin's best man.

25:28.327 --> 25:29.996
I was looking for you.

25:29.996 --> 25:32.865
Sorry, I thought
you were trespassing.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.601
Wanna help me up?

25:40.773 --> 25:43.042
Right now,
this site's still a secret,

25:43.042 --> 25:45.244
and so we always gotta worry
about thieves.

25:45.244 --> 25:47.914
Mm. We requested
the wedding party to stay put.

25:47.914 --> 25:51.083
You're the only one
who did not.

25:51.083 --> 25:54.286
So, your friend's dead,
the bride is grieving,

25:54.286 --> 25:56.723
and you're out here
digging around in the dirt.

25:56.723 --> 26:00.226
I know how it looks,
but, you know, winter's coming.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.895
With the fossil weathering
out of the ground like it is

26:02.895 --> 26:04.530
and the rain
and the snow on the way,

26:04.530 --> 26:05.932
we-- we don't have
any time to waste.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.068
Wow.

26:14.473 --> 26:16.542
Tyrannosaurus rex.

26:16.542 --> 26:17.576
You know your theropods.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.145
Mm.

26:19.145 --> 26:20.512
My son was
a dinosaur freak.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.216
That's not why you came
out here, though, is it?

26:24.216 --> 26:26.886
Skylar told us that Austin
asked you for help.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.721
- Are you some kind of expert?
- Hardly.

26:28.721 --> 26:31.323
This is-- This is like
a side hustle, I guess.

26:31.323 --> 26:32.925
Yeah, this one day
on a job site,

26:32.925 --> 26:35.561
I found
a Spinosaurus tooth.

26:35.561 --> 26:39.165
- And the rest is history.
- Any money in that?

26:39.165 --> 26:41.634
I mean, I made 350 bucks
on the tooth.

26:41.634 --> 26:43.569
What about your T. rex?
How much is that worth?

26:43.569 --> 26:45.271
I mean,
it's too early to say.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.907
- Well, just a ballpark.
- Okay.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.475
Uh, I mean,
if this thing's intact,

26:49.475 --> 26:50.609
it could be worth millions.

26:53.813 --> 26:55.715
Carson, where were you
early this morning?

26:57.817 --> 27:01.187
- I was asleep in my room.
- Mm.

27:01.187 --> 27:02.321
Anyone else
who can verify that?

27:02.321 --> 27:03.956
No. Sorry.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.524
But it's the truth.

27:13.700 --> 27:16.435
The way Madeline described
Walter's birth mom--

27:16.435 --> 27:18.470
- Oh, Sunny Barnes.
- It has to be.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.272
It explains a lot.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.441
He had help hiding
all those years.

27:22.441 --> 27:25.377
Yeah, it does. Yeah, we
definitely got to talk to her.

27:25.377 --> 27:26.979
What about Cormac?

27:26.979 --> 27:28.681
Think he knows
anything about this?

27:31.684 --> 27:34.020
I don't know.

27:34.020 --> 27:36.155
Ah, that's my ex.
Hang on.

27:37.890 --> 27:40.359
- Hey.
- Beau, thank God.

27:40.359 --> 27:41.828
I don't know what's going on,
but it's really bad.

27:41.828 --> 27:44.063
Whoa, whoa.
Slow down.

27:44.063 --> 27:45.965
- What happened?
<i>- It's Avery.</i>

27:45.965 --> 27:48.901
I-I think something terrible
might've happened.

27:48.901 --> 27:50.870
I just need you to come.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.805
- Okay, where are you?
- At his hotel.

27:52.805 --> 27:54.974
<i>- I'm on my way.</i>
- Okay.

27:54.974 --> 27:56.475
I'm gonna need Emily to hang out
with you a little longer.

27:56.475 --> 27:59.245
- Is that cool?
- Yeah, whatever you need.

28:03.149 --> 28:04.283
Thank you.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.588
- You talk to the vendors?
- Sure did.

28:09.588 --> 28:11.891
And I have decided that I am
never getting married.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.928
For the right guy,
I might try again.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.898
For the right guy, huh?
Have you met him yet?

28:21.100 --> 28:23.669
- What do you got, Pops?
- Let's change the subject.

28:23.669 --> 28:25.738
All right, so the florists,
they, uh, had a crew

28:25.738 --> 28:27.406
on-site at the ranch
early this morning.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.175
Somebody see something?

28:29.175 --> 28:31.210
One of the crew noticed a person
leaving Austin's room.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.879
Fits our timeline
for the murder.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.713
Any chance they can
I.D. the suspect?

28:34.713 --> 28:36.248
Doubtful.
It was still pretty dark.

28:36.248 --> 28:37.850
But they got a look
at a jacket.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.585
It had this reflective
mountain logo on it.

28:41.287 --> 28:42.922
Carson had a jacket
just like that.

28:42.922 --> 28:44.090
The best man?

28:45.457 --> 28:48.027
Our bone collector
might be hiding something.

28:50.262 --> 28:52.799
I put Paige over here.

28:52.799 --> 28:54.466
Come on.

28:57.636 --> 28:58.971
Paige!

29:00.239 --> 29:01.140
Hey!

29:07.880 --> 29:09.415
Where is she?

29:09.415 --> 29:11.583
I don't know.
She couldn't be far.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.619
I told her to stay put.

29:13.619 --> 29:15.421
Or you're lying to us.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.824
Why would I do that and bring
you all the way out here?

29:17.824 --> 29:20.426
- I'm not stupid.
- No...

29:20.426 --> 29:23.595
but you are desperate
for some reason.

29:23.595 --> 29:26.232
Aim for the larger part
of the leg, right there.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.067
I tell you,
Paige was here.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.635
Well, we'll see
about that.

29:31.337 --> 29:32.604
Go look for her.

29:37.109 --> 29:41.313
If he can't find Paige,
we are all in big trouble.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.215
Especially you.

29:45.551 --> 29:48.787
Carson, gonna need you
to step out of the vehicle.

29:53.559 --> 29:56.195
You were seen leaving
Austin's room this morning.

29:56.195 --> 29:58.664
That's impossible,
but okay.

29:58.664 --> 30:00.599
A witness said that the person
leaving Austin's room

30:00.599 --> 30:02.935
was wearing the jacket
you have on right now.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.170
Austin and I
aren't the only ones

30:04.170 --> 30:05.437
with this jacket, all right?

30:05.437 --> 30:07.306
I had them made for the whole
crew when we started the dig.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.475
- Cuff him.
- Yeah.

30:09.475 --> 30:12.011
I didn't kill him.
Wait, wait, hold on.

30:13.679 --> 30:15.481
I think maybe I know
who was in Austin's room.

30:15.481 --> 30:16.849
Who?

30:16.849 --> 30:20.552
Austin wasn't always
the most faithful.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.989
I thought he had ended things
with her, but maybe not.

30:22.989 --> 30:25.457
Ended things with who?

30:25.457 --> 30:28.861
With Natalie,
Skylar's bridesmaid.

30:28.861 --> 30:31.130
She and, uh-- she and Austin
found the dinosaur together.

30:31.130 --> 30:32.564
I met her.

30:32.564 --> 30:34.133
She said her and Austin
were working on a project.

30:34.133 --> 30:36.335
Yeah, and she was part
of our crew.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.570
Did you ever confront him
about the affair?

30:38.570 --> 30:39.805
When I tried to talk to him,
he just told me

30:39.805 --> 30:41.140
to mind my own business.

30:41.140 --> 30:43.209
Let's go.

30:48.747 --> 30:51.317
Okay, so maybe Natalie
goes to Austin

30:51.317 --> 30:52.584
the night before
his wedding,

30:52.584 --> 30:54.887
a last-ditch effort
to convince him to be with her.

30:54.887 --> 30:56.188
He chooses Skylar,

30:56.188 --> 30:58.157
and she kills him
in a jealous rage.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.325
Well, there's more.

30:59.325 --> 31:01.894
Natalie discovers
the dinosaur with Austin,

31:01.894 --> 31:03.729
but it's on
his family's land.

31:03.729 --> 31:05.231
She has no legal claim
to it.

31:05.231 --> 31:06.532
It's gotta be her.

31:08.434 --> 31:10.502
Unless...

31:10.502 --> 31:12.038
What are you thinking?

31:12.038 --> 31:14.206
Skylar didn't know
about the dinosaur

31:14.206 --> 31:16.842
until Austin asked her
to sign the prenup.

31:16.842 --> 31:19.078
She thought he was spending
all that time

31:19.078 --> 31:21.047
digging for buried treasure
on his own.

31:22.248 --> 31:24.050
What if,
on your wedding day,

31:24.050 --> 31:25.384
you're betrayed
by the two people

31:25.384 --> 31:26.852
supposed to love you
the most?

31:26.852 --> 31:29.255
Oh, God.

31:29.255 --> 31:32.091
It's Skylar.

31:32.091 --> 31:34.026
Do you know where she is?

31:34.026 --> 31:35.794
I saw her getting into
Austin's truck.

31:35.794 --> 31:37.964
I have an idea where
she might be headed.

31:47.106 --> 31:50.709
Cormac, I-I have
something I need to tell you.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.578
It might be hard to hear.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.713
It's about your mother.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.115
I already know.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.219
Walter's my brother.

32:00.219 --> 32:02.188
Half-- Half-brother.

32:05.357 --> 32:07.559
How long have you known?

32:07.559 --> 32:10.762
Found out yesterday.

32:10.762 --> 32:15.034
I'm still processing,
otherwise I woulda told ya.

32:22.141 --> 32:24.010
She's been lying to me
my entire life.

32:27.546 --> 32:29.181
But she's my mother.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.990
I don't know
what to do, Cass.

32:37.990 --> 32:40.759
If you don't have
any part in this,

32:40.759 --> 32:41.994
you need to do
what's right.

32:44.463 --> 32:48.167
I promise you, I didn't know
anything about this.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.678
I want you to know
that, um...

32:59.678 --> 33:02.648
whatever you find...

33:02.648 --> 33:04.783
I'm my own man.

33:11.190 --> 33:14.993
Convinced the front desk clerk
to let me in.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.228
Huh.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.733
He got a gun.

33:21.733 --> 33:24.203
Avery hated guns.

33:24.203 --> 33:26.505
His voice
when he called me--

33:26.505 --> 33:28.540
I'm telling you,
something is wrong.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.876
Hey, it's okay.

33:30.876 --> 33:32.978
We'll have a look around,
see what it tells us.

33:32.978 --> 33:34.880
- Okay?
- Okay. Uh-huh.

33:39.618 --> 33:42.188
Well, he was definitely
working on something.

33:42.188 --> 33:44.490
Avery never left
his computer unlocked.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.492
Wait, what is this?

33:46.492 --> 33:48.760
I've never seen it before.

33:48.760 --> 33:53.365
It looks like a recovery phrase,
maybe, or a password.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.933
He was going after that money
that Luke and Paige stole,

33:54.933 --> 33:56.535
wasn't he?

33:56.535 --> 33:57.936
How the hell
should I know that?

33:57.936 --> 34:00.139
- I don't know!
- All right. Hey.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.710
Listen to me.
I'm gonna find him, okay?

34:04.710 --> 34:06.145
- I will.
- Okay.

34:08.814 --> 34:09.915
Come here.

34:11.283 --> 34:13.885
More importantly, I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you

34:13.885 --> 34:15.287
or to Emily.

34:17.456 --> 34:18.724
- Okay.
- You got it?

34:18.724 --> 34:20.025
Yeah.

34:26.298 --> 34:28.367
There she is.

34:37.843 --> 34:39.678
Skylar, step away
from the ledge.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.249
Put the weapon down.

34:48.387 --> 34:50.256
Stay away from her.
She deserves this.

34:50.256 --> 34:52.158
You don't have to do this.

34:52.158 --> 34:55.294
They weren't just
sleeping together, Mo.

34:55.294 --> 34:57.463
They were in love.

34:57.463 --> 34:58.930
He lied to me
about everything.

34:58.930 --> 35:01.600
He named the dinosaur after her.
I found the paperwork.

35:03.302 --> 35:04.770
I gotta get in there, Pops.

35:07.439 --> 35:11.943
Skylar. Skylar.
Look at me. Look.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.445
Okay, look at me.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.681
Think of your dad.
He's lost everything.

35:15.681 --> 35:18.317
He can't lose you, too.
She-- She's not worth it.

35:18.317 --> 35:20.186
Right? Neither was he.
All right?

35:21.119 --> 35:23.522
No! Stop! Aah!

35:23.522 --> 35:25.123
Natalie.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.124
Natalie, wake up.

35:29.528 --> 35:30.662
