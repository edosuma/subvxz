WEBVTT

00:24.721 --> 00:26.674
Is this even on?

00:26.675 --> 00:28.301
Yes, it is.

00:28.302 --> 00:28.798
Really

00:28.799 --> 00:30.780
Please don't
shake it too much.

00:30.981 --> 00:32.198
Well, how do you
use this thing?

00:32.200 --> 00:33.661
You are somewhat
amateurish aren't you.

00:33.741 --> 00:37.501
I don't know how to operate a camera.
I just know how to be in front of a camera.

00:37.581 --> 00:39.661
Well you get what you pay
for these days right .

00:39.662 --> 00:40.721
You didn't even pay me!

00:40.731 --> 00:41.841
That's what I'm getting at.

00:41.901 --> 00:45.112
Look, you wouldn't even know
about this thing is, without me.

00:45.113 --> 00:46.841
I didn't even know what this thing is.

00:46.921 --> 00:48.873
But anyways, I got to get to my
introduction, so let's turn to me.

00:48.874 --> 00:49.761
Okay.

00:51.401 --> 00:52.801
To the millions around the world.

00:52.881 --> 00:53.635
Millions?

00:53.660 --> 00:55.896
You only have 12 subscribers!

00:55.897 --> 00:58.481
Okay, but I've got like 20 views.

00:58.561 --> 01:01.612
Anyways this is Brandon.
Thanks for tuning in again.

01:01.613 --> 01:03.681
We are in Dallas, Texas.

01:03.861 --> 01:05.876
I don't know if you people
are familiar with that.

01:05.877 --> 01:07.141
And what takes place down here.

01:07.521 --> 01:08.675
I don't really know either.

01:08.676 --> 01:11.282
Other than the fact that we are
about to make magic happen.

01:11.362 --> 01:13.988
So tell us, give us a little
bit about whats going on here.

01:13.989 --> 01:14.942
Turn it to you.

01:15.022 --> 01:17.349
We are going to Michael's Place.

01:17.350 --> 01:20.622
Which is Calvin, my hot
boyfriend's friend.

01:20.902 --> 01:24.462
Oh great. I'm turning off the car.
So here we go.

01:25.842 --> 01:28.983
Is Michael going to be okay
with you having the camera on?

01:29.084 --> 01:29.790
Really ?

01:30.191 --> 01:31.142
Yah..

01:31.922 --> 01:33.982
It's okay. I'll sweet talk him.

01:34.062 --> 01:35.981
Do not forget that
Calvin is the star.

01:35.982 --> 01:38.662
Calvin is the star!
I'll be sure to document that.

01:40.862 --> 01:42.137
Coming.

01:44.862 --> 01:46.586
- Hey!
- Hi!

01:46.642 --> 01:47.167
La'Nette?

01:47.192 --> 01:48.866
Yah, I'm La'Nette.

01:48.891 --> 01:49.437
- Brandon

01:49.462 --> 01:50.410
- Hey Brandon.

01:50.442 --> 01:50.901
Film class?

01:50.926 --> 01:52.786
Guys, come in.
Film class?

01:52.842 --> 01:54.216
Yah! Final cut!

01:54.241 --> 01:56.963
Oh, I remember. I think.

01:56.988 --> 01:57.708
Okay, just making sure.

01:57.763 --> 01:58.907
No problem.

01:58.932 --> 02:00.907
Em.. and you are?

02:01.063 --> 02:03.505
I'm Shay, I'm
Calvin's girlfriend.

02:03.506 --> 02:05.023
I'm Calvin's sister.

02:05.103 --> 02:07.760
Oh! Nice to meet you!
My god, you are gorgeous!

02:07.761 --> 02:08.763
Oh, thank you!

02:08.842 --> 02:12.314
Such resemblance .
It must be in the genes!

02:12.315 --> 02:14.503
Oh yah. Calvin's in there.

02:14.883 --> 02:16.793
Oh right.
So real quick.

02:16.818 --> 02:18.307
- Okay.
- Follow me.

02:18.363 --> 02:21.153
So uh, Brandon, I know you
love the whole film thing.

02:21.154 --> 02:23.143
But Michael.. not so much.

02:23.323 --> 02:25.763
Calvin: Big black guy, buff.
Love it.

02:25.764 --> 02:28.283
He'll be all in front of the camera.
He thinks he's a star.

02:28.363 --> 02:31.825
Michael.. kind of you know.. arrogant .

02:32.350 --> 02:34.043
Michael!
Here's Brandon .

02:34.044 --> 02:35.007
Who ?

02:35.663 --> 02:37.213
Brandon, Brandon is my name.

02:37.338 --> 02:38.517
Hey..

02:38.518 --> 02:38.987
And your name is?

02:39.043 --> 02:41.284
- Michael... Glad to have you.
- Nice to meet you, thanks for having me.

02:41.364 --> 02:44.003
What's that? You 're.. welcome.
What is that.

02:44.128 --> 02:45.788
I'm sure we'll have a good time.

02:45.844 --> 02:46.914
You're sure excited,
I appreciate that.

02:46.915 --> 02:50.184
I'm so excited, and
Michael's cute too.

02:50.364 --> 02:52.557
Oh, how're you doing.
I'm Calvin the man.

02:52.558 --> 02:54.404
You know, 100 grand.

02:54.484 --> 02:57.877
Hey, and this is my beautiful ...
Roxanne.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.364
Great. Can you go help?

02:59.444 --> 03:02.109
I'm just playing.
I will be right back baby.

03:02.110 --> 03:04.604
He just make me speechless.
I'm so sorry.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.745
She makes me feel alright.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.812
If I can get this table in
here and put down. Excuse me.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.388
- I'm sorry.
- Come on, come on.

03:10.444 --> 03:12.011
Okay so, we are all here.

03:12.012 --> 03:15.144
Can anyone tell us exactly, why..
we are here?

03:15.224 --> 03:18.510
I can, uh in fact I
would love to

03:18.611 --> 03:21.184
but first of all, that's..
got to go.

03:21.264 --> 03:23.025
I don't like it.
I can't have the camera.

03:23.026 --> 03:24.665
We can possibly get
one million views.

03:24.745 --> 03:25.771
No, turn it off please.

03:25.772 --> 03:26.458
Who wants to be a millionaire?

03:26.483 --> 03:28.009
- Brandon!
- Yes.

03:28.065 --> 03:29.254
Thank you, Calvin!

03:29.255 --> 03:30.325
Turn it off.

03:31.105 --> 03:32.925
- Relax, baby.
- Thanks.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.885
Oh look, the camera in my face again.

03:36.965 --> 03:38.873
Look, all I need is 30 seconds.
That's all I'm asking.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.805
Something
interesting, please.

03:40.985 --> 03:42.872
30 seconds..

03:43.197 --> 03:44.289
Go!

03:44.345 --> 03:45.648
You know Shay out there?

03:45.649 --> 03:46.600
I do know Shay.

03:46.625 --> 03:48.929
We're both in the NYFA.
And we can't fail.

03:48.985 --> 03:49.753
What is NYFA?

03:49.754 --> 03:51.084
New York Film Academy.

03:51.109 --> 03:52.414
New York Film Academy?

03:52.415 --> 03:52.849
Yes.

03:52.905 --> 03:53.918
Isn't this Dallas?

03:53.919 --> 03:56.348
Dump logistics make
such interesting topics.

03:56.373 --> 03:57.649
I don't know what that means.

03:57.705 --> 04:00.081
With the camera here.
For what I wanna do. I just don't think

04:00.082 --> 04:02.265
it's going to help.
In fact I don't think it will work.

04:02.345 --> 04:04.018
What won't work?
I need specifics.

04:04.019 --> 04:05.012
I know you do but..

04:05.037 --> 04:07.189
Just give me this, we can't fail.

04:07.245 --> 04:09.056
I'll make you a deal,
If it will shut you up.

04:09.081 --> 04:10.356
I'll tell you something. Deal?

04:10.381 --> 04:10.829
Deal.

04:10.830 --> 04:11.470
Great.

04:11.526 --> 04:13.356
What we are going to do
is actually going be

04:13.357 --> 04:14.845
a uh...

04:14.946 --> 04:15.606
Ouija board.

04:15.686 --> 04:16.620
Oh my God, are you serious?

04:16.946 --> 04:18.277
I know I know, right? Shh...

04:18.278 --> 04:18.890
Perfect!

04:18.946 --> 04:20.392
I know, I am excited
too but shh....

04:20.394 --> 04:22.466
That's why I don't want
that camera here. I mean...

04:22.846 --> 04:25.896
Ghost popped out. They are not going
to popped out in front of a camera.

04:25.897 --> 04:28.486
I mean have you ever seen a good
picture or video of a ghost.

04:28.566 --> 04:29.451
"Twilight."

04:29.476 --> 04:32.230
That's a movie and it's vampires.
So you're not even in the same room.

04:32.286 --> 04:33.580
I just need you to cut it off.

04:33.581 --> 04:35.926
Can you just give me something
while we are out there?

04:36.006 --> 04:37.459
I'll give you this.

04:37.484 --> 04:40.550
There are somethings I have to go over,
there's couple of rules I got to touch on.

04:40.606 --> 04:43.401
Em.. I'll let you film that.

04:43.426 --> 04:44.984
But once we start
playing the board,

04:44.985 --> 04:45.889
No more filming.

04:45.890 --> 04:46.790
Sound good?

04:46.846 --> 04:47.481
hat works. Thank you.

04:47.482 --> 04:48.306
You're welcome.

04:50.226 --> 04:52.050
Auto focus, good.

04:52.075 --> 04:53.553
Light, great.

04:53.578 --> 04:54.951
A lot of exciting things
are about to happen.

04:55.007 --> 04:56.458
I'm learning whats happening tonight.

04:56.483 --> 04:58.635
I've learned there's going to
be a Ouija board involved.

04:58.661 --> 05:01.551
So there's going to be some creepy things,
ghost adventures.

05:01.807 --> 05:03.850
Who knows whats gonna happen here tonight.

05:03.875 --> 05:06.012
But you won't find out
unless you stay tune.

05:06.067 --> 05:07.747
You know you really are
pushing the boundaries.

05:07.772 --> 05:10.011
I said I give you some camera
time and now you want interviews.

05:10.367 --> 05:15.087
Michael has been around forever.
You know he is Calvin's best friend so..

05:15.167 --> 05:17.784
Well Calvin and La'Nette, I
mean I've known them forever.

05:17.809 --> 05:18.891
I mean the longest time

05:18.947 --> 05:20.218
In fact since I moved here,

05:20.243 --> 05:22.805
Calvin was the first few
people I met when I got here

05:22.807 --> 05:27.647
I don't know. I don't even like
him like that. He's so silly!

05:29.207 --> 05:31.207
Uh, me and Calvin had gone to the club.

05:31.287 --> 05:34.675
We met at a nightclub,
and it's the Luna Lounge.

05:34.700 --> 05:38.011
- Luna lounge, and she..
- And it was about a month ago.

05:38.067 --> 05:41.143
And uh.. we were both kind of
flirting with this one girl.

05:41.168 --> 05:43.208
And.. I broke off and
I went to the bar,

05:43.233 --> 05:44.476
cos I wanna get a drink.

05:44.508 --> 05:46.241
And I actually met Shay first .

05:46.242 --> 05:48.588
And we actually chatted
up for a minute.

05:48.668 --> 05:49.885
And I was going to
buy her a drink.

05:49.886 --> 05:53.108
And then you know, here comes too
small for his body shirt Calvin.

05:53.188 --> 05:57.524
She had that beautiful satin red
dress that was fitted to her body.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.628
And it was just like banging it.

05:59.808 --> 06:03.296
I was not wearing
a red fitted dress.

06:03.297 --> 06:04.168
Em..

06:04.648 --> 06:07.768
And you know, he's around
nobody else gets seen, so...

06:07.848 --> 06:09.307
Him and Shay started
talking and uh.

06:09.308 --> 06:10.688
So that's kinda
what that is, so..

06:10.768 --> 06:14.408
Oh, yes, yes . You remembered
when I talked to you.

06:14.433 --> 06:18.272
And I told you I had a dream about me and
you on a beach, salsa dancing?

06:18.328 --> 06:21.843
He is the most ridiculous thing ever.

06:21.868 --> 06:25.813
And how a woman can sit there
and believe what comes out of his mouth.

06:25.869 --> 06:26.326
Okay ...

06:26.327 --> 06:27.970
I was thinking about that night.

06:27.995 --> 06:30.053
That night you was ..
what color were you wearing?

06:30.109 --> 06:31.024
It was blue.

06:31.025 --> 06:32.790
- Yes, yes. - Strapless?

06:32.815 --> 06:34.893
That's right, blue
strapless dress.

06:34.949 --> 06:37.589
It was wonderful...

06:38.269 --> 06:39.945
She's the financial girlfriend.

06:39.970 --> 06:41.593
You are wearing the watch.

06:41.649 --> 06:45.449
Yes, oh yes. She bought me this watch.
Beautiful.

06:45.929 --> 06:48.049
- Look!
- A Rolex!

06:48.129 --> 06:52.889
Then you have a hottie girlfriend,
a sex girlfriend , a cute girlfriend..

06:52.969 --> 06:55.133
I got a new car
girlfriend,

06:55.134 --> 06:57.169
drive me around the block girlfriend.

06:57.249 --> 06:58.429
Oh, do that again.

07:01.369 --> 07:03.271
How much you want to bet.

07:03.296 --> 07:06.113
Wait till she turns her head.
He was doing stuff like.

07:06.169 --> 07:08.347
Hey, what's that over there?

07:08.348 --> 07:09.350
What?

07:09.930 --> 07:12.204
She's ... poor girl.

07:12.229 --> 07:13.434
She is blind.

07:13.490 --> 07:15.052
Is that it?
Are we done.

07:15.077 --> 07:15.588
Sure.

07:15.589 --> 07:17.174
Great,
thanks.

07:19.170 --> 07:23.166
I know you are all excited to find out
why I gathered everybody here for tonight.

07:23.191 --> 07:25.354
- Yes please..
- So here it is.

07:25.410 --> 07:27.003
Drum roll please.

07:27.028 --> 07:29.974
- Yah, sure.
- What we got here.

07:30.930 --> 07:32.765
- Won't you hold that for me?
- Yup.

07:32.790 --> 07:34.674
Thank you. I'll get it.
Thank you.

07:34.930 --> 07:36.883
And one of... this.

07:36.908 --> 07:38.196
Oh shut the front door.

07:38.197 --> 07:39.174
Hey, hey ,hey..

07:39.230 --> 07:41.076
You don't even even know what it is.

07:41.101 --> 07:44.094
I'm not crazy. I can look at it.
It's is a Ouija board.

07:44.150 --> 07:45.524
But, Haven't you ever
been a bit just curious.

07:45.549 --> 07:45.978
No!

07:45.979 --> 07:47.351
Not even just a little?

07:47.352 --> 07:47.894
No!

07:47.950 --> 07:49.914
Well I am.
So I'm very excited in this.

07:49.915 --> 07:51.424
Do you know why
I'm not curious?

07:51.425 --> 07:51.990
Why is that La'Nette?

07:52.070 --> 07:56.471
Because Grand mama never raised no fool.
I'm not suppose to be here.

07:56.551 --> 07:57.582
Isn't your grand mama dead?

07:57.607 --> 07:59.095
Yah, probably
from a Ouija board.

07:59.151 --> 08:00.018
That's not possible.

08:00.019 --> 08:01.335
Would you like to
say hello thou?

08:01.360 --> 08:02.075
No!

08:02.731 --> 08:03.681
I'm excited!

08:03.682 --> 08:06.191
Thank you, Shay.
Shay is excited.

08:06.271 --> 08:08.132
Did they just high-five?

08:08.157 --> 08:10.775
Now, first of all I just want to make sure
everybody is in at least.  Okay.

08:10.831 --> 08:11.446
Are you in?

08:11.471 --> 08:13.291
- I'm here.
- Thank you La'Nette.

08:13.315 --> 08:13.881
Shay ?

08:13.906 --> 08:14.470
- I'm in.
- Thank you.

08:14.471 --> 08:17.367
Calvin, on his phone right,
all night, imagine that.

08:17.368 --> 08:18.811
Calvin? Are you in?

08:18.891 --> 08:20.053
Okay, okay, okay,
yah yah, yah..

08:20.054 --> 08:21.331
I'm in, I'm in..

08:21.411 --> 08:24.118
Alright. Now this is what
we are working with here.

08:24.143 --> 08:25.755
This is our Ouija board, okay.

08:25.811 --> 08:29.091
We ask it questions and
it will gives us answers base on the..

08:29.171 --> 08:31.529
Yes or no.
Letters if it wants to spell it out,

08:31.554 --> 08:33.715
or numbers if it wants
to give us numbers.

08:33.770 --> 08:36.731
And of cos "goodbye".
Alright.

08:36.811 --> 08:38.600
2nd piece we got is the..

08:38.601 --> 08:39.552
Pointer.

08:39.732 --> 08:42.948
Right. This is what it's
going be kind of showing

08:42.950 --> 08:45.652
us the answers when
we ask the questions.

08:45.732 --> 08:48.481
We asked some questions
and we move it according

08:48.482 --> 08:50.893
to what we think the
spirit is telling us.

08:50.918 --> 08:52.916
Kind of. We don't move it though.

08:52.972 --> 08:55.215
You see, the whole point is
if we do this right.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.475
When we are touching it,

08:56.476 --> 08:57.456
It should it move on its own.

08:57.512 --> 08:59.756
In another words, I think it's the
spirits will move through us.

08:59.757 --> 09:00.203
Oh my God!

09:00.204 --> 09:01.132
You know what I mean.

09:01.612 --> 09:03.538
There are some rules that
do need to be covered.

09:03.563 --> 09:05.056
We should start
with it, come on.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.410
- Okay, ready. Rule number 1,
there is three of them.

09:07.435 --> 09:10.636
Number 1, Never ask a
spirit how it died. Okay.

09:10.692 --> 09:12.292
Okay, uh, why?

09:12.572 --> 09:16.867
Well uh. because let's say the spirit
has this traumatic tragic death.

09:16.892 --> 09:17.556
Right.

09:17.612 --> 09:18.933
You asking it, you don't want
it to relive that death.

09:18.946 --> 09:20.277
over and over
and over.

09:20.302 --> 09:21.276
Okay.

09:21.332 --> 09:24.225
So it may freeze the board up
and then it won't talk to us anymore.

09:24.226 --> 09:25.628
Then we just wasted everything.

09:25.653 --> 09:26.937
- Alright, got it.
- Okay.

09:26.993 --> 09:31.113
Rule Two. Never ask the Spirit
how youâ€™re going to die. Okay.

09:31.393 --> 09:32.149
Why ?

09:32.150 --> 09:35.173
Well, because number 1
partly you don't want to know.

09:35.253 --> 09:37.261
And num 2. They say that if
you asked it how you are

09:37.262 --> 09:39.193
going to die, then you mind
is going to create it.

09:39.273 --> 09:42.516
Subconsciously , when the day they
say you are going to be there.

09:42.517 --> 09:43.793
it's going to happen. so.

09:43.873 --> 09:44.575
I'm out of here.

09:44.576 --> 09:46.913
Where are you going?
You said you are going to stay.

09:46.993 --> 09:50.016
Okay, donâ€™t forget.
I'm just going to the bathroom.

09:50.017 --> 09:51.353
I'll be right back...

09:51.433 --> 09:55.785
Okay last rule. Alright guys this is the
most important rule. So please. Okay.

09:55.786 --> 09:56.873
Alright.

09:57.053 --> 09:59.117
If nothing else,
follow this one for me.

09:59.118 --> 09:59.693
Okay man.

09:59.773 --> 10:04.462
You never ever leave the board
without saying goodbye.

10:04.463 --> 10:06.593
Alright, not ever.

10:07.373 --> 10:08.963
Apparently If you don't
say goodbye,

10:08.964 --> 10:11.216
all it does is leave
this board open.

10:11.217 --> 10:11.654
Alright.

10:11.734 --> 10:15.334
And that means they are open
from their world to our world.

10:15.414 --> 10:18.646
And..
I don't know what they can do.

10:18.647 --> 10:19.454
Okay.

10:21.954 --> 10:22.974
Boo!

10:23.454 --> 10:25.946
I'm just wanna go on the record saying

10:25.947 --> 10:27.274
that everybody
in here jumped.

10:27.354 --> 10:29.241
Okay so,

10:29.242 --> 10:30.213
alright so.

10:30.238 --> 10:33.140
Everyone kind of put their uh hand...

10:33.165 --> 10:34.498
Just coming for a
little close-up.

10:34.554 --> 10:37.449
This is going to be that cut moment.
Like remember what we talked about.

10:37.450 --> 10:39.264
Where it's ..
this is going to be that moment.

10:39.265 --> 10:40.894
Can I just have a few
more seconds, please?

10:40.974 --> 10:43.639
No. This is..this is that
spot, remember I was like,

10:43.640 --> 10:46.154
I let you film everything
else, Now we are done.

10:46.234 --> 10:47.174
Okay.

10:50.714 --> 10:53.235
Is anybody there?

10:53.375 --> 10:55.200
- Idah.. !
- What is that?

10:55.225 --> 10:56.113
What?

10:56.138 --> 10:58.999
I asked, 'Is anybody there' in
a different language.

10:59.055 --> 11:03.595
I figure it hadn't understand English,
maybe another language might work.

11:03.875 --> 11:05.798
You are so sexy...

11:06.023 --> 11:08.619
- Oh ...
- Hey, come on.

11:08.675 --> 11:12.179
We have been doing this for a while now,
asking the same same question.

11:12.204 --> 11:13.581
Alright. Yo..yo..yo.

11:13.582 --> 11:14.499
Is anybody there?

11:14.555 --> 11:16.639
Brother.
Respect the board, remember.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.515
I respect.
I'm just being myself.

11:18.995 --> 11:20.429
Are you sure we are
asking the right thing?

11:20.430 --> 11:21.635
I'm not..
Is it the right question?

11:21.715 --> 11:24.376
Just try, we try it one hand.
maybe we got too much going on.

11:24.377 --> 11:25.915
- Okay.
- I told you it don't work.

11:25.995 --> 11:26.798
Okay uh.

11:26.823 --> 11:28.968
- Nothing here is real.
-Let's see.

11:28.993 --> 11:30.300
Is that on still?

11:30.355 --> 11:32.075
Michael! Michael! Michael!

11:33.500 --> 11:34.539
Yes..

11:34.695 --> 11:36.013
Wow.

11:36.026 --> 11:37.354
Who moved it? I know it's
one of y'all. Calvin..?

11:37.355 --> 11:38.616
No, La'Nette moved it.

11:38.696 --> 11:40.005
Why would I move it

11:40.030 --> 11:41.900
Because I can see the
white of your fingernails..

11:41.925 --> 11:45.440
from the pressure you are pushing down
on the plank and whatever it's call.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.164
Just ask another question.

11:47.189 --> 11:48.262
Uh..uh..

11:48.263 --> 11:49.580
What's your name?

11:52.136 --> 11:54.318
Oh, oh my gosh !

11:56.043 --> 11:58.100
Oh man. No way.

12:00.116 --> 12:02.536

- I don't know.. Gracie.

12:02.616 --> 12:06.140
Uh..uh..
How old are you?

12:08.865 --> 12:10.780
She is just a little girl.

12:10.796 --> 12:13.436
Where are you?

12:20.276 --> 12:23.917
- R-T-R?

12:23.997 --> 12:26.797
"Right Here" (Right here)?

12:34.017 --> 12:36.877
This staff don't work.
Good job acting like a baby.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.957

13:31.378 --> 13:33.658

13:39.498 --> 13:40.698
Bad.

13:48.418 --> 13:51.338
Beware.
Bad. Beware. Oh man.

13:52.018 --> 13:55.059
Can you guys. can you guys ask one spirit
how another spirit died?

13:55.339 --> 13:57.232
Uh.. It didn't say you couldn't.

13:57.257 --> 13:58.403
- It didn't say you could .

13:58.459 --> 14:00.679
Yah, but.. I don't know.

14:27.454 --> 14:28.822

14:28.823 --> 14:29.343
Yah.

14:35.899 --> 14:36.815

14:39.040 --> 14:40.740
- Oh!
- Jesus, man!

14:40.820 --> 14:42.755
- It's is my phone.

14:42.780 --> 14:45.284

Calvin, come on man.

14:46.549 --> 14:49.464
Put your hand back on the board ..

14:55.600 --> 14:59.366
Hold on.
Can I have a little bit of privacy, please?

14:59.391 --> 15:01.044
Get out of here man.

15:02.800 --> 15:03.700
Turn off the ...

15:04.840 --> 15:07.620
You know. We can all still play
I mean I don't want to lose it.

15:07.621 --> 15:10.400
We actually have something here,
I do want to lose what we got.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.364
- Yah, that's a great idea!
- Let's ask another question.

15:12.389 --> 15:13.724
Let me go ask a question.

15:13.725 --> 15:14.664
Okay! Go ahead.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.354
Who is he texting?

15:16.379 --> 15:21.124
Oh no.
This is not going to be good.

15:25.061 --> 15:26.318
Girl.. girl.

15:26.343 --> 15:29.065
So uh, what's her name ?

15:32.801 --> 15:34.752
It's still going.

15:36.077 --> 15:37.645
(whisper) Do something.

15:37.901 --> 15:41.898
You know its .. these thing don't even
always tell the true. For all we know.. so

15:42.023 --> 15:42.785

15:42.841 --> 15:45.688
Alright I'm back! So what did I miss?
What's going on?

15:45.713 --> 15:47.746
We are glad you can join us.
-Thank you, thank you.

15:47.771 --> 15:49.581
Yes.. very glad,
you can join us.

15:49.601 --> 15:51.921
- Hey, beautiful!
- So who were you texting?

15:52.001 --> 15:54.002
Oh I was texting my mother.

15:54.327 --> 15:57.365
Oh your mom.
Okay, what's her name?

15:57.521 --> 16:00.401
My mother?
Her name is Theresa.

16:00.481 --> 16:04.651
Oh really, that's funny, because
the board said it's "B-L-R".

16:04.676 --> 16:06.541
B-L-R..

16:06.581 --> 16:09.421
Yah, I asked who were you
texting and the board said

16:09.422 --> 16:12.422
your were speaking with a
girl name initials of B-L-R.

16:13.002 --> 16:15.282
Why are you asking a board
about who I am talking too?

16:15.362 --> 16:17.949
There is nothing wrong with that.

16:17.974 --> 16:22.006
I mean, every time I ask you
in person, you get mad.

16:22.862 --> 16:25.815
And you say, oh it's nothing
and you just blew me off.

16:25.840 --> 16:26.966
And just like when..

16:27.022 --> 16:30.077
Well first of all. I don't get mad.

16:30.102 --> 16:33.206
You always ask me who I am talking too and
I'm telling you, I'm handling business.

16:33.262 --> 16:35.500
Now I don't walk away
every time I get texted.

16:35.501 --> 16:37.262
I talk in front of
you all the time.

16:37.342 --> 16:39.254
How come you said
your mother's name

16:39.255 --> 16:41.062
is Theresa, and
this says "B-L-R"?

16:41.142 --> 16:42.997
Ooh, such a conversation.

16:43.022 --> 16:45.246
Maybe you should have alone.

16:45.302 --> 16:47.073
Yes, we should..
alone in the car.

16:47.098 --> 16:49.986
We should. That's right,
I apologize. I'm sorry.

16:50.142 --> 16:51.527
That's fine. You can do
this some other time.

16:51.540 --> 16:52.936
We can just get back to
the game and we can...

16:52.961 --> 16:54.851
Where are you going?

16:54.876 --> 16:55.631
Shay! Its..

16:55.663 --> 16:57.376
- Nice meeting you, Shay!
- Yes.

16:57.401 --> 16:59.327
- Same here.
- Calvin, come on man.

16:59.383 --> 17:01.535
Calvin, you have a lot of
explanation to do to me.

17:01.536 --> 17:03.206
I'll be in the
car, I'm coming.

17:03.607 --> 17:04.343
That's right

17:04.423 --> 17:05.634
You felt that thing moved.

17:05.659 --> 17:06.973
Okay, okay.
Hello!

17:06.973 --> 17:09.527
Excuse me, uh..
is anybody there?

17:09.583 --> 17:11.269
Hello, is anybody there.

17:11.294 --> 17:12.814
You know, you know..

17:12.815 --> 17:14.219
Better yet

17:14.243 --> 17:15.646
why don't you show yourself.

17:15.703 --> 17:18.127
Huh, thank you! Michael.

17:18.153 --> 17:19.243
Some friend, some friend!

17:19.244 --> 17:21.022
Come on, this is not my fault.

17:21.103 --> 17:22.053
Yah, okay.

17:22.078 --> 17:23.166
- Bye, brother.
- Bye.

17:23.623 --> 17:25.171
You know he is not going to talk to me for
at least another ...

17:25.195 --> 17:25.598
Whoa .

17:25.624 --> 17:26.830
Are you doing that?

17:27.063 --> 17:28.056
Why would I do that?

17:28.080 --> 17:28.848
I don't know.

17:28.873 --> 17:32.147
I didn't know this thing could
move if it was just the two of us.

17:32.203 --> 17:35.543
Well, it is. So just.. keep watching it.

17:37.483 --> 17:39.562
BDRM?
I didn't even ask it a question.

17:39.587 --> 17:41.179
I didn't either?

17:41.204 --> 17:41.932
Did you?

17:41.964 --> 17:44.417
Why would I? You guys have not
appreciated my work all night.

17:44.442 --> 17:46.349
Of course.

17:46.404 --> 17:48.902
Calvin. Right before he left.

17:49.227 --> 17:52.328
"Why don't you show yourself."

17:53.484 --> 17:56.284
BDRM.
Who is BDRM?

17:57.009 --> 18:00.008
Bdrm, it's short for bedroom
(bedroom).

18:01.384 --> 18:03.560
- Out of the question.
- Alright, alright,

18:03.585 --> 18:05.608
- We'll both go. Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

18:05.764 --> 18:06.625
Both going to leave me?

18:06.650 --> 18:08.348
Oh no. That's that part
where the black girl

18:08.373 --> 18:09.709
gets killed, because the
two white people left.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.068
I'm on my way
with you

18:11.124 --> 18:13.891
Okay, we'll all go. But we
have to come right back

18:13.916 --> 18:15.868
and say goodbye to the board.
Okay.

18:15.924 --> 18:17.974
Not a problem. I'm
down with the rules.

18:17.999 --> 18:18.948
Okay.

18:20.004 --> 18:21.226
So let's go.

18:21.251 --> 18:22.269
Okay

18:24.365 --> 18:25.490
It's fine, It's fine.

18:25.515 --> 18:27.549
Okay.
Please wait.. wait.. wait..

18:27.605 --> 18:29.529
- I'm right here.
- Okay.

18:29.554 --> 18:32.449
- I'm just scare.
- I know. I know.

18:33.905 --> 18:35.380
- So dark, can we turn on the light?
- Yes.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.767
I got to recovered it.

18:37.792 --> 18:39.418
I need this arm.

18:39.443 --> 18:40.813
Okay.

18:41.045 --> 18:42.304
Jesus! You are scaring me.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.335
Sorry. It's still dark.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.693
Do you have another light?

18:45.725 --> 18:48.385
Yah, I do. I'll get it.

18:53.765 --> 18:55.452
Oh god. There is nothing here.

18:55.477 --> 18:56.689
Okay, we are getting

18:56.714 --> 18:59.469
all freak out for nothing.
We are good, Brandon.

18:59.525 --> 19:00.725
Yes!

19:00.805 --> 19:02.350
Brandon, were you in my room?

19:02.375 --> 19:03.195
No, I wasn't.

19:03.220 --> 19:04.993
What's wrong?

19:05.025 --> 19:06.838
Why, I don't put my picture down.

19:06.963 --> 19:08.330
Or maybe you knocked it down
when you got out of bed or something.

19:08.386 --> 19:09.217
No, I didn't knock it down.

19:09.218 --> 19:10.127
You sure you weren't in here?

19:10.128 --> 19:11.726
No, I wouldn't do
something like that.

19:12.406 --> 19:14.776
Really Brandon? If you
did, it's not cool.

19:15.001 --> 19:15.990
No..

19:16.446 --> 19:17.406
This  ...

19:19.986 --> 19:21.534
Alright seriously!

19:22.835 --> 19:23.546
My pictures.

19:23.726 --> 19:25.802
I mean, why is it upside down?

19:26.527 --> 19:28.161
And you weren't in here?

19:28.162 --> 19:29.230
No, I wasn't.

19:29.386 --> 19:31.227
Brandon, seriously .
You don't come to

19:31.228 --> 19:33.115
someone's house and
do stuff like this.

19:33.140 --> 19:34.170
I'm gone, I'm leaving.

19:34.226 --> 19:37.055
- La'Nette, hold on, we got to.
- Look out, look out.

19:37.580 --> 19:38.750
We got to say goodbye to the board.

19:38.806 --> 19:40.409
Fine, I'll say goodbye
to the board.

19:40.410 --> 19:42.316
But I'm telling you
after that I'm leaving.

19:42.341 --> 19:43.550
That's fine.

19:43.906 --> 19:45.746
Are you still there?

19:49.026 --> 19:50.626
Shit.

19:50.706 --> 19:53.012
Uh, well you know it's
late and we really

19:53.013 --> 19:55.427

19:58.967 --> 20:02.396
Hey uh. We promise we'll

20:02.421 --> 20:03.991
If you say "Goodbye".

20:08.667 --> 20:09.827
Got it.

20:09.907 --> 20:11.764
Alright, so uh.. goodbye.

20:11.765 --> 20:12.767
Goodbye.

20:16.627 --> 20:18.103
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

20:18.128 --> 20:19.651
We have to play with it tomorrow now.

20:19.707 --> 20:21.514
I don't care about playing
with it tomorrow.

20:21.515 --> 20:23.080
I didn't want to play
with it tonight.

20:23.105 --> 20:24.582
I just want wanna go home.

20:24.583 --> 20:26.571
This has been all
kinds of weird.

20:26.927 --> 20:28.555
Fine, fine. Tomorrow thou.

20:28.580 --> 20:31.425
Yah, definitely . I'll be here tomorrow.
Good night Michael.

20:31.450 --> 20:32.075
Goodnight La'Nette.

20:32.107 --> 20:34.090
Good night, Brandon.

20:34.115 --> 20:35.423
Jesus.

20:35.449 --> 20:38.996
Oh my gosh,

20:39.228 --> 20:42.268
No. It's been a long night.
That's it.

20:42.293 --> 20:43.932
That's what you call a wrap,
alright.

20:44.188 --> 20:45.536
Can I say one more thing?

20:45.561 --> 20:46.243
Yah.

20:46.468 --> 20:47.776
Dude, you're screwed.

20:49.908 --> 20:53.658
Alright ... I got this set up.

20:53.683 --> 20:54.932
Thing's good.

20:54.988 --> 20:57.492
Hey, now I'm about

21:03.028 --> 21:04.906
Alright, now check it out.
It's about to be sweet.

21:04.919 --> 21:06.808
Alright, good,

21:08.388 --> 21:12.248
Okay, so you all can see everything? Good?

21:12.328 --> 21:15.068

21:16.108 --> 21:18.732
- Hi, baby!
- Hi baby. How you doing.

21:18.757 --> 21:20.432
You ready to go?

21:20.488 --> 21:23.369
- You look good.
- Oh, thank you.

21:23.649 --> 21:25.089
Are we going to have dinner?

21:25.169 --> 21:27.910
Well, see. First baby,
that was my plan.

21:27.935 --> 21:30.633
I wanted to eat before I left.

21:31.489 --> 21:34.969
Oh! You're so naughty!

21:35.049 --> 21:37.743
You know I'm just saying.
You know how I feel.

21:37.768 --> 21:38.913
So what do you say?

21:39.529 --> 21:40.449
For you.

21:40.474 --> 21:41.489
For me.

21:41.514 --> 21:42.433
Anything.

21:42.489 --> 21:46.189
Anything, well that's
what I like to hear baby.

21:46.269 --> 21:47.730
What's that?

21:47.755 --> 21:49.093
What?

21:49.149 --> 21:50.953
That, that thing over there!

21:50.978 --> 21:52.973
No, it's just my clothes over there.
What's you talking about.

21:53.029 --> 21:57.085
No, I'm not talking about the clothes.
I know that over there, that's a camera.

21:57.089 --> 21:59.625
That old thing.
That's just a toy story camera.

21:59.650 --> 22:01.407
I was playing toys and house today.

22:01.431 --> 22:02.257
No, it isn't!

22:02.289 --> 22:03.124
It is.

22:03.149 --> 22:05.653
It is on. And why is it on?

22:05.709 --> 22:07.844
I learned about
that from Brandon.

22:07.869 --> 22:09.454
That red dot right there.

22:09.510 --> 22:12.111
Oh.. that red dot.

22:12.136 --> 22:13.851
I was playing with a girl.
That's finger nail polish baby.

22:14.276 --> 22:15.134
That's like nothing.

22:15.190 --> 22:17.796
- No, it is not!
- Baby..

22:17.821 --> 22:20.914
Look baby,
I don't want this on Youtube.

22:20.970 --> 22:24.185
I like to go and take a
nice hot shower with you,

22:24.210 --> 22:26.074
but I don't know about that.

22:26.130 --> 22:28.158
Baby, I promise you.

22:28.183 --> 22:29.948
Its not going to be on Youtube.

22:29.973 --> 22:30.919
It's not going to be on Xtube.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.197
The only place it's going to be,

22:34.222 --> 22:35.834
is on my tube, baby.

22:36.190 --> 22:36.906
Okay.

22:36.931 --> 22:38.934
Alright.

22:44.870 --> 22:45.481

22:45.606 --> 22:46.894

to the L, to the V-I-N.

22:52.861 --> 22:54.635

22:56.736 --> 22:59.896

22:59.921 --> 23:02.219
Alright, baby.

23:02.251 --> 23:04.411

23:04.436 --> 23:07.675
Ah, you know I'm coming.
Now and later.

23:11.691 --> 23:12.636
Come on.

23:12.661 --> 23:13.465
I'm coming baby.

23:13.490 --> 23:16.335

23:17.011 --> 23:19.511
Alright, I'm coming, I'm coming.

23:21.491 --> 23:23.545
Oh.. oh.. oh..oh baby ...

23:23.570 --> 23:24.555
What ?

23:24.611 --> 23:26.815
I can't take no shower without my hair cap.
Can you go get

23:26.840 --> 23:29.115
the shower cap off the bed please.
I forgot it out there.

23:29.171 --> 23:30.228
Are you serious ?

23:30.253 --> 23:32.012
Yes, baby.
I'm serious.

23:32.537 --> 23:33.895
Where is it.

23:33.951 --> 23:34.867
It's on the bed?

23:35.692 --> 23:36.986
Where on the bed?

23:37.011 --> 23:40.216
It's on the bed, It's under some
clothes or something baby.

23:40.572 --> 23:43.852
Hurry up. I can't wait, I'm so anxious.

23:43.932 --> 23:46.292
Uh, you talking about this ...

23:47.372 --> 23:50.112
Clear, wrinkled ..

23:50.792 --> 23:52.547
- Yah.
- Plastic.

23:52.572 --> 23:53.156
Yah.

23:54.012 --> 23:55.466
Are you sure?

23:55.491 --> 23:57.356
Yes, it's condom.

23:57.412 --> 23:58.807
It is not, it's too big.

23:58.832 --> 24:01.156
That's what I said.
It's a condom.

24:01.972 --> 24:05.387
Ha, ha, girl I'm just playing.
Come on, hurry up.

24:05.412 --> 24:07.530
Cos I've got nothing
but love for you baby.

24:07.555 --> 24:08.360
Come on.

24:10.184 --> 24:14.184
Calvin's in the house.
Calvin's in the house.

24:15.512 --> 24:16.972
Baby, hurry up!

24:17.997 --> 24:19.036
Yah.

24:19.892 --> 24:22.061
Come on now, roll it.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.637
(card - BLR )

24:25.773 --> 24:27.230
Brandon, What are
we doing here?

24:27.255 --> 24:28.357
We are going online.

24:28.413 --> 24:30.829
- And why do you have so many computers?
- I noticed, this

24:30.854 --> 24:33.397
is.. really weird.
- I want one, you got bunch of them.

24:33.453 --> 24:35.970
Hey, hey. You guys everheard this before.

24:35.995 --> 24:39.116
Uh, don't ask questions you
don't know the answer to.

24:39.141 --> 24:39.918
Got it.

24:39.973 --> 24:41.007
I got to go with you on that one.

24:41.032 --> 24:41.407
Thanks.

24:41.432 --> 24:42.020
So rude.

24:42.053 --> 24:44.664
Anyways, remember we were playing
with the Ouija-board the other night?

24:44.689 --> 24:45.306
- Yup.
- Got it.

24:45.331 --> 24:47.181
Yah, so, there is this
girl I know from Youtube.

24:47.213 --> 24:49.353
- Youtube.
- I love Youtube.

24:49.433 --> 24:52.163
And oh .. "It's So Cold in the D...
(T.baby) "

24:52.188 --> 24:52.877
That's how hilarious.

24:52.903 --> 24:54.235
Did you see the girl
in the background?

24:54.260 --> 24:57.321
She just like : "Bang, bang".
Then she got her eyes like ...

24:57.553 --> 24:59.141
(chicken sound) No, not quite.
There are only

24:59.154 --> 25:00.753
three people on Youtube.
you need to know about.

25:01.133 --> 25:02.964
Number 1, Lonely Island Boys.

25:02.989 --> 25:04.478
Number 2, Cigarobsession ...

25:04.503 --> 25:05.541
I don't know anything about that.

25:05.573 --> 25:07.055
Yah, no you wouldn't because you are
not man enough.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.067
Jesus.

25:08.092 --> 25:08.622
Yah, right.

25:08.654 --> 25:11.101
And finally number 3, KC.

25:11.326 --> 25:12.319
KC and Jojo!

25:12.344 --> 25:15.622
Uuu yeah.. ! baby yeah...!
Uuu.. yeah..

25:15.634 --> 25:17.783
Yeah, you know, time out,
time out, time out. I'm more

25:17.808 --> 25:19.838
of a Boyz 2 Men type fan.
Anyways back back to KC.

25:20.094 --> 25:20.768
Are they still a band?

25:20.793 --> 25:21.779
Yah, they are still a band,

25:21.804 --> 25:23.858
They are still around.
Do you watch the "Tosh. O".

25:24.014 --> 25:25.589
Guys can we please
get through this .

25:25.614 --> 25:26.678
She's about to be
online any second now.

25:26.734 --> 25:28.288
And I want to look my best.

25:28.313 --> 25:30.569
Because, she does not know
it but I havea crash on her.

25:30.594 --> 25:31.862
- Oh..Brandon
- Its not stalkerish. Its not stalkerish.

25:31.894 --> 25:33.319
It's not even a
real person probably.

25:33.344 --> 25:35.218
It is a real person.
Just wait, wait, wait...

25:35.274 --> 25:36.305
Hello ..

25:36.330 --> 25:37.460
- Hey, KC!
- Hi.

25:37.461 --> 25:38.184
Hey.

25:38.185 --> 25:39.361
I'm Michael.

25:39.386 --> 25:40.386
I'm La'Nette.

25:40.394 --> 25:42.344
Great. We are here to talk
about the Ouija board right.

25:42.369 --> 25:44.178
Yah, we are here to talk
about the Ouija board.

25:44.534 --> 25:46.671
So anyways, the 3 of us and
a couple of other people.

25:46.696 --> 25:48.318
We were playing with
it the other night.

25:48.374 --> 25:50.737
Let's stop right there.

25:50.762 --> 25:52.889
First of all you don't
play withthe Ouija board.

25:52.902 --> 25:55.039
You played with the
cards or a Nintendo.

25:55.095 --> 25:58.715
A Ouija board is a medium used
to communicate with the dead.

25:58.795 --> 26:00.484
But why would you want to
communicate with the dead?

26:00.509 --> 26:01.879
Why would you want
to talk to anybody?

26:02.135 --> 26:04.775
Because, typically they
have something to say.

26:04.955 --> 26:08.715
The Ouija board itself is just one of the
unexplained phenomenons in the world.

26:08.795 --> 26:12.328
Think about the Bermuda Triangle.
Planes, boats disappearing mysteriously

26:12.353 --> 26:14.899
with no evidence or what so ever.

26:15.024 --> 26:16.063
Yah, I heard about
stuff like that.

26:16.095 --> 26:19.994
Even in west Texas, a farmer
being watched by his family,

26:20.019 --> 26:21.699
vaporized into thin air.

26:21.755 --> 26:23.135
What? That actually happen?

26:23.160 --> 26:25.899
Yah, yah. Yes, it's just one of those
things you really can't explain.

26:25.955 --> 26:28.032
But why are the
spirits here then?

26:28.757 --> 26:31.499
Because they have a message
that they want to convey.

26:31.555 --> 26:34.615
Not necessary all spirits are bad.

26:34.695 --> 26:37.687
I like to think of
spirits as good.

26:37.712 --> 26:39.940
You know, guardian angels
or protectors even.

26:39.996 --> 26:42.287
Uh. Are they dangerous?

26:42.312 --> 26:43.756
I feel that

26:43.781 --> 26:47.800
danger is more in the eye of the beholder.
The eye of the user of the board.

26:47.856 --> 26:51.381
I mean, If you are sitting there
trying to conjure up you know,

26:51.406 --> 26:54.820
a satanic type spirit then that's
probably what you will get.

26:54.876 --> 26:59.423
I think the best example is ...

26:59.448 --> 27:02.940
There is this chick named
Doris from California.

27:02.996 --> 27:05.496
And this is one of the
most vulgar documented

27:05.497 --> 27:08.336
paranormal activities
still known to men.

27:08.816 --> 27:12.051
She was in her house
and she had been

27:12.076 --> 27:15.480
sexually assaulted and
beaten by ghosts.

27:15.536 --> 27:19.576
She have a bunch of ghost adventure type
people come up with recorded videos.

27:19.656 --> 27:21.937
They got photos, the whole shebang.

27:23.017 --> 27:23.947
Wait.

27:23.972 --> 27:26.761
Wait, isn't it.. isn't it they made
the movie "The Entity" about that.

27:26.817 --> 27:30.386
Yes. But you don't have to worry
about any of that as long as

27:30.411 --> 27:33.921
you follow the rules and you
always remember to say goodbye.

27:33.977 --> 27:36.489
I did. I make sure I lay the
rules out.

27:36.514 --> 27:37.833
And we definitely said
goodbye afterwards.

27:37.858 --> 27:38.273
We did.

27:38.298 --> 27:39.925
But okay, I have a question then.

27:39.957 --> 27:42.519
Uh, so we said goodbye and
we did everything normal.

27:42.544 --> 27:45.201
Do we have nothing, so we
have nothing to worry about?

27:45.357 --> 27:47.258
No. It's just..

27:47.283 --> 27:49.701
The board itself is not
only used to communicate.

27:49.757 --> 27:50.941
It's also...

27:51.142 --> 27:52.812
a portal.

27:52.837 --> 27:55.061
It's a door to a whole
another dimension.

27:55.317 --> 27:56.793
If you don't say goodbye

27:56.818 --> 27:59.561
That's like leaving
your front door open.

28:00.017 --> 28:01.648
Anyone can come in.

28:01.673 --> 28:02.681
Oh.

28:04.137 --> 28:07.838
- You mean like.. to get raped?
Like that Youtube 'Antoine.'

28:07.918 --> 28:10.158
"hide your kids, hide your wife
, everybody is getting raped."

28:10.238 --> 28:11.676
Thank you guys, bye.

28:11.677 --> 28:12.918
Hey..hey..hey..

28:12.998 --> 28:15.794
Guys guys guys...

28:15.819 --> 28:17.300
I want to schedule something
for tomorrow night.

28:17.325 --> 28:18.586
- With who?
- She's already gone.

28:18.718 --> 28:19.739
You're so silly.

28:19.764 --> 28:21.451
Look up that
Youtube video thou,

28:21.476 --> 28:23.182
look I think it's 'Antoine'.
- 'Antoine', yeah.

28:23.238 --> 28:25.938
- I'll do it, don't worry.
- Hide your kids, hide your wife, hahaha..

28:27.578 --> 28:28.465
You ready?

28:28.466 --> 28:30.018
Yup. Let's do it.

28:30.098 --> 28:32.401
Oh man, I hope you
don't get creepy again.

28:32.402 --> 28:33.578
Oh no, that was bad.

28:33.658 --> 28:34.780
Go ahead.

28:34.781 --> 28:35.698
Okay.

28:36.078 --> 28:39.278
Is anybody there?

28:40.978 --> 28:42.261
Maybe we lost it.

28:42.262 --> 28:45.098
Well, we got to keep
trying, don't we?

28:45.678 --> 28:48.698
Hello. Anybody there?

28:52.419 --> 28:54.859
- Oh, it's creepy.
- Everytime.

28:54.939 --> 28:57.419
Hey, Gracie! Is that you?

29:03.819 --> 29:07.219
Who are we talking to?

29:18.359 --> 29:19.659
Lisa.

29:20.739 --> 29:22.998
Okay. Hi, Lisa.

29:22.999 --> 29:24.859
Hey, Lisa.

29:25.039 --> 29:25.667
Uh..

29:25.668 --> 29:28.179
Can we talk to Gracie?

29:39.620 --> 29:42.109
- 'NOT'
- What that mean?

29:42.110 --> 29:44.300
No, like not her.

29:44.380 --> 29:45.756
Oh, oh, okay.

29:45.757 --> 29:50.960
Uh, Lisa, it's not that we
don't want to talk to you.

29:51.040 --> 29:55.220
We were just uh wondering if it is ok
with you that we that we talk to Gracie.

29:55.300 --> 29:58.933
Since we promised her we would
you know talk to her today.

29:58.934 --> 30:03.000
So, can we speak to Gracie
and then we'll talk to you?

30:03.200 --> 30:06.240
- That's weird.
- Yah, I think so.

30:06.320 --> 30:07.840
She agree.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.699
I cannot get used to that.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.002
I know, right.

30:17.003 --> 30:19.280
Hi, Gracie, is that you?

30:21.361 --> 30:22.418
No..?

30:22.419 --> 30:24.321
Lisa..?

30:27.641 --> 30:30.121
Who could it be?

30:30.701 --> 30:33.361
Oh. It moving, it moving ...

30:33.541 --> 30:35.225
J ...?

30:35.226 --> 30:37.541
Joseph?

30:37.721 --> 30:39.601
It's probably is...

30:39.681 --> 30:40.176
Jesus!

30:40.477 --> 30:41.901
Oh, we are screwed.

30:42.481 --> 30:43.453
Brandon, can you go
get the door please.

30:43.454 --> 30:44.021
Go!

30:47.241 --> 30:48.141
Hello?

30:50.501 --> 30:51.401
Hello?

30:52.981 --> 30:55.029
Hi

30:55.030 --> 30:55.541
Hi.

30:55.542 --> 30:56.181
Oh hey, Shay.

30:56.261 --> 30:59.641
- Perfect!
- I mean we are suppose to..

31:00.221 --> 31:02.161
It's perfect. Who are you guys talking to?

31:02.241 --> 31:04.046
Uh, I think it's
Joseph, we think.

31:04.047 --> 31:05.963
Oh good. I like to join in.
I have a question.

31:05.976 --> 31:07.902
Okay.

31:07.982 --> 31:11.872
So uh.. The other night,
you said Calvin was

31:11.873 --> 31:14.351
talking to this girl, Blair.

31:14.352 --> 31:15.502
Who is she?

31:30.362 --> 31:31.026
- Friend.
- Friend

31:31.027 --> 31:32.722
Its a friend..
it's a friend of Calvin's.

31:33.202 --> 31:35.839
That night it said girl.
And this time I said who is she,

31:35.840 --> 31:37.215
it says it's a friend
its a girlfriend.

31:37.216 --> 31:38.262
That's suppose to be me.

31:38.642 --> 31:42.442
Did Calvin meet this girl
the same night he met me?

31:52.283 --> 31:54.143
Was she.. was she wearing a red dress?

32:06.603 --> 32:09.683
Does Michael know about this girl?

32:16.203 --> 32:19.203
Yah, I mean ...

32:19.283 --> 32:21.975
Does Michael know that
Calvin was talking

32:21.976 --> 32:24.603
to this girl and to
me at the same time?

32:30.563 --> 32:33.512
Yes. I do, I knew.

32:33.513 --> 32:35.723
- Wow! Really, Mike?
- You knew.

32:35.803 --> 32:36.806
What? Yes, I knew.

32:36.807 --> 32:39.364
You know all about this
and you didn't tell me!

32:39.444 --> 32:42.287
Why would I tell you.
Calvin is my best friend.

32:42.288 --> 32:43.424
What am I to you?

32:43.504 --> 32:45.404
Shay, come on..we just met.
This has nothing to do with it.

32:45.405 --> 32:47.304
I thought we were friends ...
I thought we were friends.

32:47.484 --> 32:49.000
Look, I known
Calvin a lot long...

32:49.013 --> 32:50.539
And all these time you
pretended he's texting somebody.

32:50.540 --> 32:52.404
Classic, classic.
Absolutely classic. This is Smooth.

32:52.684 --> 32:53.309
And you were sitting down
there asking who is she.

32:53.322 --> 32:53.958
No, you don't know.

32:53.971 --> 32:55.255
You pretended like you
don't know anything.

32:55.256 --> 32:57.144
- I didn't know. Shay, I'm not about to
throw my best friend under the bus just..

32:57.224 --> 32:58.902
Don't yell at her, don't yell at her.
She's already upset.

32:58.915 --> 33:00.604
I'm not
yelling at her.

33:00.684 --> 33:02.932
La'Nette, why you got to
be involve in this anyway?

33:02.945 --> 33:04.063
Oh my god. I'm not trying
to be involve in this.

33:04.076 --> 33:05.204
This is ridiculous.

33:05.284 --> 33:06.882
What kind of guy, what kind of guy
pretends like that. It's not right.

33:06.895 --> 33:07.688
You sat here. We were just at the board.
And you knew, you just..

33:07.701 --> 33:08.504
- It's not my business to be
involved in their business.

33:08.784 --> 33:09.515
Shay wait.

33:09.516 --> 33:11.026
Shay come on.

33:11.027 --> 33:11.404
Shay wait.

33:11.484 --> 33:15.844
So, final thoughts with Brandon here.
That went really well, I think.

33:16.024 --> 33:19.384
We got a lot of great stuff.
I hope you guys out there are enjoying it.

33:19.464 --> 33:22.945
Below. Click on the link for "Cheaters",
they have brought you here, this tonight.

33:23.225 --> 33:25.012
- And tomorrow night we are
going to hope to contact the

33:25.025 --> 33:26.822
ghost who uh.. looking for alimony check.
- Brandon !

33:26.823 --> 33:27.585
Yes, can I help you?

33:27.665 --> 33:30.256
- Come on. Put that thing down, let's go!
- No, I can't.

33:30.257 --> 33:32.665
Come on. It's chaos out here.
This is ridiculous!

33:32.745 --> 33:33.525
Did somebody die?

33:33.526 --> 33:35.905
It doesn't matter.
Come on before someone does die ...

33:35.985 --> 33:38.038
Alright fine,
just hold on a second.

33:38.039 --> 33:40.565
- Oh, hurry up!
- I got to put down my camera.

34:05.645 --> 34:09.234
Oh, what a night. Every night.
It's always on me.

34:09.246 --> 34:12.846
Cause I know
what's going on.

34:12.926 --> 34:17.386
Calvin can't keep his dick in his pants.
That's my fault. Sure, why not?

34:20.126 --> 34:21.946
The board.

34:25.286 --> 34:26.366
Hello.

34:29.585 --> 34:31.866
Uh.. I'm going to say goodbye.

34:32.346 --> 34:35.646
So I going to put this here.

34:36.045 --> 34:37.886
Goodbye?

34:38.766 --> 34:42.426
I said it. You said it.

34:43.106 --> 34:45.525
Everyone is happy. Right?

34:46.926 --> 34:51.186
Yah . That's it.
That will be fine.

34:57.187 --> 34:58.387
Brandon, what's up?

35:00.067 --> 35:00.819
Yah man.

35:00.820 --> 35:03.827
Heh, thanks again,
for taking her.

35:04.207 --> 35:06.127
I don't know man. It's not my problem.

35:06.907 --> 35:10.467
The piano? Oh, there it is.
Yah, you did leave it.

35:11.047 --> 35:13.511
Yah, I'm looking right at it.

35:13.512 --> 35:14.127
Yup.

35:16.367 --> 35:18.207
Okay. Yah, I'll hold it.
Just come get it tomorrow.

35:19.587 --> 35:21.587
Alright, thanks.

35:23.727 --> 35:25.407
A camera, huh?

35:27.208 --> 35:28.607
Oh, look at that .

35:31.008 --> 35:32.027
Huh.

35:35.007 --> 35:38.668
Oh hey guys.
Welcome back to the Brandon show.

35:38.748 --> 35:40.219
I'm still stuck in the closet.

35:40.220 --> 35:43.308
That's why I'm so pissed off at
the world and hate everybody.

35:43.988 --> 35:45.908
Haha. Whatever.

35:52.688 --> 35:55.688
Is that a joke?
Brandon, is that you?

35:56.608 --> 36:00.568
Come on. Are you playing a trick on me?
Come on.

36:22.149 --> 36:26.889
All right. It's a trick. It's a trick.
He is messing with you.

36:49.369 --> 36:53.209
"GREETINGS. GREETINGS.
PLEASE MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME. "

36:53.389 --> 36:59.289
"Don't mind the open grave.
We'll let you know if its for you."

37:00.370 --> 37:01.710
Oh my god.

37:07.334 --> 37:11.534
You know what Brandon.
I hate you.

37:13.650 --> 37:19.050
Okay, Mr. Camera. You are here because
I just got a phone call from Mike.

37:19.130 --> 37:23.410
All weird out saying he is hearing things.
Because we forgot to say goodbye.

37:23.490 --> 37:26.730
How did we possibly forget to say goodbye?
It's the first rule.

37:26.810 --> 37:29.578
Now Shay is over here,
irritating me to death.

37:29.591 --> 37:32.370
Because of
my brother.

37:32.850 --> 37:36.010
I'm sorry, Michael.

37:36.890 --> 37:38.890
Yah.

37:39.970 --> 37:43.490
Okay, talk to you tomorrow. Goodbye.

37:45.050 --> 37:45.946
I'm sorry.

37:45.947 --> 37:49.352
I was just really
hurt and confused.

37:49.353 --> 37:51.951
And I don't know what to do.

37:52.031 --> 37:55.051
I understand, don't worry.
You don't have to keep apologizing.

37:55.131 --> 37:58.310
All I'm saying is, if we start
hearing stuff over here.

37:58.311 --> 38:00.411
You better Jackie
Chan their asses.

38:01.191 --> 38:02.377
But I'm not Chinese.

38:02.378 --> 38:04.085
Oh girl don't worry about it.

38:04.110 --> 38:06.875
You know you Asians know
all the same karate.

38:06.971 --> 38:09.103
How about I just make it up?

38:09.104 --> 38:11.311
Tomorrow we'll say goodbye.

38:11.491 --> 38:14.552
Oh, you damn right we're
going to say goodbye.

38:14.553 --> 38:16.571
Somebody going to say goodbye.

38:24.891 --> 38:26.832
Alright. I'll record everything.

38:26.833 --> 38:29.013
This'll teach you to leave the
camera in my house.

38:29.014 --> 38:30.831
Douche.

38:33.191 --> 38:35.992
That shows that I'm man for that.
You might know what it is.

38:46.712 --> 38:49.760
This is my La'Nette doll.
Uuu...

38:49.761 --> 38:50.712
Shhh...

38:51.092 --> 38:53.276
La'Nette, if you
do ever see this

38:53.277 --> 38:55.332
I just want you to know that...

38:56.292 --> 38:59.026
I may have just a little..

38:59.027 --> 39:02.052
teeniest, teeniest, tiniest...

39:02.532 --> 39:03.512
*uck.

39:09.992 --> 39:12.072
What was that?

39:12.152 --> 39:14.592
I heard something.

39:14.672 --> 39:16.952
La'Nette?

39:17.332 --> 39:19.752
Is this you?

39:27.973 --> 39:29.953
Where did you go?

39:40.077 --> 39:41.277
What?

39:42.893 --> 39:44.973
La'Nette?

39:45.053 --> 39:47.313
Is this you?

40:08.734 --> 40:11.374
La'Nette?

40:35.014 --> 40:37.354
(Scream) Ah...!

40:37.934 --> 40:41.354
Oh god. What was that?
I saw something!

40:45.054 --> 40:46.994
I saw something.

40:56.750 --> 40:58.650
(Scream)  Ahh....!

40:59.775 --> 41:01.815
- Oh, God!
- Oh, God.

41:01.895 --> 41:03.362
- I'm Sorry.
- Oh my God.

41:03.363 --> 41:04.855
Where were you?

41:05.335 --> 41:08.495
I was out getting the patty on!
You are losing your mind girl.

41:08.575 --> 41:10.830
Oh my gosh. I was on the phone.

41:10.831 --> 41:12.575
I was talking to Mike.

41:12.655 --> 41:15.455
I saw something.
Over there.

41:17.375 --> 41:19.774
You saw something, where?

41:19.775 --> 41:21.195
Right there.

41:22.655 --> 41:24.935
There's nothing out there.

41:25.015 --> 41:30.375
Girl, you got us..
It's probably all this Ouija-board talk.

41:30.455 --> 41:34.415
Oh my God, girl.
You almost scared my jaws off.

41:34.496 --> 41:37.216
Okay. You're probably right.
I'm sorry.

41:37.796 --> 41:39.243
Go to bed.

41:40.144 --> 41:42.456
-Good night.
- Good night.

41:46.136 --> 41:49.216
Here we are again Youtube.
It's Brandon. I found my camera.

41:49.296 --> 41:51.106
And we are going back to
the devil's den tonight.

41:51.107 --> 41:53.096
Who knows what's going to
happen with the Ouija board.

41:53.176 --> 41:55.678
Somebody could be cheating.
Somebody could be missing.

41:55.679 --> 41:57.351
I don't know, you
got to stay tune.

41:57.352 --> 41:57.816
Let's go.

41:57.896 --> 41:59.426
Too crazy. How's Shay doing?

41:59.427 --> 42:01.976
I mean she's good.
She sounds better than you.

42:02.056 --> 42:03.282
What's wrong with your voice?

42:03.283 --> 42:05.656
All the yelling and screaming
just got me all irritated.

42:05.736 --> 42:07.912
What's up nerd?
What are you doing here?

42:07.913 --> 42:10.696
Hey guys, I got my camera
back so I'm ready to film.

42:10.776 --> 42:12.748
I see that.
You know what I'm going to do?

42:12.749 --> 42:16.096
I'll take a roll of duct tape and just
tape that literally to your face.

42:16.176 --> 42:17.686
I was try to do another
Witchboard (movie).

42:17.699 --> 42:19.219
What's a
Witchboard?

42:19.220 --> 42:20.043
I don't know

42:20.044 --> 42:22.261
Tawny Kitaen,
Whitesnake video girl.

42:22.262 --> 42:23.937
Here I go again on my own..

42:23.957 --> 42:27.115
If, if you just
agree to shut up.

42:27.116 --> 42:29.437
We let you keep filming.

42:29.717 --> 42:30.639
That's was a, that was a great idea.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.817
Alright,
let's do it the right way.

42:33.197 --> 42:34.063
- That's why you are here.

42:34.064 --> 42:36.157
- Here to serve.
- Okay, go ahead.

42:36.237 --> 42:39.397
Alright.
Is anybody there?

42:39.477 --> 42:41.957
Is anybody there?

42:42.037 --> 42:43.607
- That's fast.
- Yah.

42:45.008 --> 42:46.737
Who are we speaking to?

42:51.797 --> 42:52.734
It's Gracie.

42:52.735 --> 42:53.906
Oh it's Gracie.

42:53.907 --> 42:55.077
Hey, girl, hey!

42:55.157 --> 42:56.770
It's a ghost, La'Nette.

42:56.771 --> 42:59.157
- I think we are cool.
- Whatever.

42:59.637 --> 43:02.756
So, Gracie, last night we
were talking to Joseph.

43:02.757 --> 43:04.877
And we didn't say
goodbye to him.

43:04.957 --> 43:07.741
So we are actually wondering,
if it'll be alright

43:07.742 --> 43:09.105
if we say goodbye to him today.

43:09.106 --> 43:10.358
Is he around?

43:17.358 --> 43:19.798
Let's play. She wants to play.

43:19.799 --> 43:22.238
Oh, honey. You are so sweet.

43:22.318 --> 43:23.415
Still a ghost!

43:23.416 --> 43:25.198
Still think it's cool.

43:25.878 --> 43:28.230
But uh, like Michael
said, sweety.

43:28.231 --> 43:32.078
We really didn't get the chance to
say goodbye to Joseph last night.

43:32.158 --> 43:34.924
And that's really important.
So if we could.

43:34.925 --> 43:37.198
Can we just speak
to him real quick.

43:42.618 --> 43:43.298
N-T, neither...

43:43.299 --> 43:44.098
- Not.
- Neither.

43:44.178 --> 43:45.687
N-T.
Not, not.

43:45.688 --> 43:48.138
- Not.. oh.
- N-T. Not.

43:48.218 --> 43:50.028
H-R.
Not hour.

43:50.029 --> 43:51.499
Not here!

43:51.579 --> 43:55.299
You don't think we let him out, do you?

43:55.579 --> 43:58.074
- Every time.   -Keeps happening.
Brandon, will you get the door please.

43:58.075 --> 43:58.999
I can't

43:59.079 --> 44:00.291
- Just get the door.
-Come on. Do your job

44:00.292 --> 44:01.859
- Alright, alright.
- Jesus.

44:02.939 --> 44:04.079
The door is open!

44:04.080 --> 44:05.939
- Thanks, Brandon.
- Thanks.

44:08.199 --> 44:09.445
Oh look, it's Calvin.

44:09.446 --> 44:10.645
Hey, what's up Cal.

44:10.646 --> 44:11.559
Hey brother.

44:12.719 --> 44:15.359
- Hey, brother.
- ... or not.

44:16.839 --> 44:18.838
Get that damn camera
out of my face.

44:18.839 --> 44:20.735
Get that damn camera
out of my face!

44:20.736 --> 44:22.939
Yo! Alright, you
seem a little tense.

44:24.519 --> 44:26.024
- Michael.
- Ya.

44:26.049 --> 44:28.375
You got something to say to me?

44:28.376 --> 44:29.339
No.

44:29.419 --> 44:30.165
Then uh..

44:30.190 --> 44:32.402
Shay came over here
the other night?

44:32.403 --> 44:33.619
Yah, she came by.

44:33.699 --> 44:35.361
Okay. What you talk about?

44:35.362 --> 44:39.220
We didn't talk about anything.
She wants to use the board.

44:39.300 --> 44:40.271
What you tell her?

44:40.272 --> 44:42.020
I didn't tell her anything.
Why?

44:42.100 --> 44:45.451
Why..Wow, you even like you
don't even know whats going on.

44:45.452 --> 44:47.180
I don't know what's going on.

44:47.260 --> 44:49.225
Okay, you know we
broke up, right?

44:49.226 --> 44:50.075
No, I didn't.

44:50.076 --> 44:51.816
And..

44:51.829 --> 44:53.580
Yah, we broke up last night.
You want to know why?

44:53.660 --> 44:54.355
Yah ?

44:54.356 --> 44:57.137
Cos somebody been running their mouth,
telling her about Blair!

44:57.138 --> 44:59.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You said it's my fault?

44:59.560 --> 45:00.765
Yah, it's your fault!

45:00.766 --> 45:03.280
No, it's not my fault.
I didn't do anything.

45:03.360 --> 45:04.584
How she know about Blair, huh?

45:04.585 --> 45:06.134
How she know that night at the club.

45:06.135 --> 45:07.560
Whoa, I didn't
tell Shay nothing.

45:07.840 --> 45:09.760
Please man! You were the one
who tried to talk to her first.

45:09.761 --> 45:11.620
- Don't talk to me in my face.
- Get your hands off me man.

45:11.700 --> 45:12.784
You were the one who tried
to talk to her first.

45:12.797 --> 45:13.891
Guys, guys...!
Stop it, stop it!

45:13.892 --> 45:14.853
Yah, so what.

45:14.854 --> 45:17.172
That's the reason why!

45:20.073 --> 45:21.890
Okay, you know what.

45:22.091 --> 45:24.021
Calvin, how long have
we known each other?

45:24.101 --> 45:27.144
10 years? Huh.

45:27.545 --> 45:30.781
How many girlfriends I
ever stole from you?

45:30.861 --> 45:33.201
None!
Zero!

45:34.881 --> 45:37.131
Do you think I'm going
to do that to you now?

45:37.132 --> 45:39.821
We are boys. Calvin.
I've known you for way too long .

45:39.901 --> 45:41.897
I am not going to steal
your girlfriend.

45:41.898 --> 45:44.721
I don't give a shit about who
wants to talk to her first.

45:44.801 --> 45:47.519
You think I care about
some girl at the club.

45:47.520 --> 45:50.001
10 years of friendship over that?
Please.

45:51.061 --> 45:54.694
I have known you way too long.
I always have your back.

45:54.695 --> 45:56.641
Just like you always have my.

45:57.621 --> 45:59.921
Over some girl?

46:02.241 --> 46:04.382
Are you going to talk to me?

46:18.222 --> 46:21.362
So how she find out?

46:24.442 --> 46:26.602
She asked the board.

46:27.482 --> 46:29.611
I know it sounds like nut,
but she asked the board thou.

46:29.612 --> 46:30.143
The board.

46:30.144 --> 46:32.582
Yah. She asked the board.
That's what she was doing over here.

46:32.662 --> 46:36.642
All right. Okay, it's fine.
Excuse me.. Excuse me.

46:36.722 --> 46:38.042
What are you you doing?

46:38.122 --> 46:41.547
What I don't understand,
is how a piece of board

46:41.548 --> 46:44.902
with a what, bifocal
magnifying glass in there.

46:44.982 --> 46:49.190
Has some type of magical powers, to
tell somebody about something I did.

46:49.191 --> 46:50.282
I don't know man.

46:50.283 --> 46:51.603
I don't understand.

46:51.683 --> 46:53.333
It was the board.
Why talk to me.

46:53.334 --> 46:54.697
Okay. Alright. That's fine man.
It was the board.

46:54.710 --> 46:56.083
Yes.

46:56.163 --> 46:58.280
Okay. Excuse me, excuse me.

46:58.281 --> 47:00.543
Where are you going? Yo!

47:00.723 --> 47:02.289
- Look man.
- Let him go.

47:02.290 --> 47:04.043
Don't walk upon me man.

47:04.123 --> 47:07.066
You know what. When you are ready.
When you are ready

47:07.067 --> 47:10.063
to tell the truth to me.
You can come get your board.

47:10.143 --> 47:11.924
Because it's going
with me right now.

47:11.925 --> 47:13.167
So, it's going
to be like that?

47:13.168 --> 47:14.283
It's like that.

47:15.243 --> 47:20.642
Oh. Oh God.
What was that?

47:20.643 --> 47:22.046
Are you okay?

47:22.047 --> 47:23.003
Yah, I'm fine.

47:23.083 --> 47:24.993
All this is ..is out of control.

47:24.994 --> 47:26.843
Everything is out of control.

47:27.223 --> 47:30.523
It's not good.
So it's going to be my fault.

47:30.603 --> 47:32.431
Stupid game. It's just
a board that he took.

47:32.444 --> 47:34.283
He took the board.

47:34.684 --> 47:37.644
- Oh, shit!
- We didn't say goodbye.

47:37.724 --> 47:39.532
Who were we talking to?

47:39.533 --> 47:41.872
The creepy little girl ghost.

47:41.873 --> 47:43.004
Oh, Gracie.

47:43.084 --> 47:46.238
I like to take this time to
thank Casper the friendly

47:46.239 --> 47:48.924
ghost who brings this,
this beautiful moment.

47:49.004 --> 47:50.564
Why are you here?

47:50.644 --> 47:52.512
Because apparently
between the two of you.

47:52.513 --> 47:54.944
Someone got an F in following
the directions in school.

47:55.024 --> 47:58.799
How about this for direction.
Direct your ass out of my house.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.840
Fine, that's fine.
I've got all the footage that I need.

48:00.841 --> 48:02.424
- I don't need to see you guys again.
- Perfect. How about this for footage.

48:02.504 --> 48:03.452
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
I'll trip you..

48:03.465 --> 48:04.424
How about this
for footage.

48:06.584 --> 48:07.983
Okay , Mr. Camera.

48:07.984 --> 48:12.024
So my pig headed brother
decides to get all upset.

48:12.104 --> 48:13.791
And he takes the board.

48:13.792 --> 48:16.944
Which means we don't
say goodbye - again.

48:17.024 --> 48:18.863
This is getting ridiculous.

48:18.864 --> 48:20.565
And you know what else.

48:20.945 --> 48:26.505
I don't need no weird little spirit ghost
running around my house.

48:26.985 --> 48:28.696
So this is what I'm going to do.

48:28.697 --> 48:30.275
I'm going to keep you on, and

48:30.276 --> 48:31.745
you're going to watch me.

48:32.125 --> 48:36.365
Because I know for a fact,
that they don't like to be on film.

48:36.965 --> 48:41.298
And now I got to be up here getting
my paranormal activity on.

48:41.299 --> 48:42.605
Shoot one and two.

48:42.685 --> 48:44.825
This is getting crazy.

48:46.605 --> 48:48.605
Alright.

48:49.405 --> 48:53.065
So, got to keep you up all night.

48:55.385 --> 48:58.305
Got a full battery.

48:59.025 --> 49:00.845
Good night.

50:33.627 --> 50:36.508
Holy shit.
Wait, wait, wait ....

50:50.448 --> 50:54.108
What?
What?

51:00.848 --> 51:04.368
Okay ...
Keep it together.

51:04.448 --> 51:07.808
Keep it together.
This is my house.

51:07.888 --> 51:09.868
Keep it together.

51:25.949 --> 51:29.149
What.
Hell no...!

52:30.010 --> 52:33.510
Okay ..
Okay..

52:41.710 --> 52:43.562
Please, Mr. Camera.

52:43.563 --> 52:45.803
Tell me you got that.

52:45.804 --> 52:47.850
Tell me you got it.

52:48.830 --> 52:51.131
I got to tell Mike

52:52.811 --> 52:54.171
Shit.

52:56.031 --> 52:58.031
The board works.

53:00.831 --> 53:04.151
You're not going to believe what
I just found on the internet.

53:04.152 --> 53:05.887
Gracie..
is the daughter of Lisa.

53:05.888 --> 53:07.151
What !

53:07.531 --> 53:10.738
Yah. Lisa..
is the mother of Gracie.

53:10.739 --> 53:14.291
And Joseph was their
next door neighbor.

53:14.671 --> 53:16.858
He was a little
slow, rain manish.

53:16.859 --> 53:19.295
But here, here's the
interesting part.

53:19.296 --> 53:20.451
What?

53:20.951 --> 53:23.614
Joseph drowned Gracie.

53:23.615 --> 53:24.391
No.

53:25.391 --> 53:27.157
And Gracie's mother, Lisa.

53:27.158 --> 53:29.671
She..
she killed Joseph in revenge.

53:29.751 --> 53:31.085
Have you told anyone else yet?

53:31.086 --> 53:34.152
No, not yet. I thought about calling
KC and just running it by her.

53:34.232 --> 53:36.742
Yah, maybe.
She knows more about this than us.

53:36.743 --> 53:39.572
Um, my stuff is really weird on my end.
Alright so..

53:39.952 --> 53:42.512
I'm going to call La'Nette to see if
anybody else got weird stuff going on.

53:42.592 --> 53:45.322
And find out what you can
and get back to me. Okay.

53:45.323 --> 53:46.232
I will, I will.

53:46.312 --> 53:47.456
Alright, thanks Brandon.

53:47.457 --> 53:48.552
Alright, see you man.

53:50.252 --> 53:51.952
Alright cool and here we go.

53:52.032 --> 53:55.366
Alright, look Michael.
Now I'm setting up this camera because

53:55.367 --> 53:58.432
you said the Ouija-board was
saying this, this and that.

53:58.512 --> 54:00.692
And I'm telling you, I
don't believe it worked.

54:00.693 --> 54:02.436
So, I'm about to try
it out right now.

54:02.437 --> 54:02.872
Alright.

54:03.652 --> 54:05.752
Yah, I don't believe this work.

54:06.032 --> 54:06.711
Okay.

54:06.712 --> 54:09.292
Is anybody there?

54:10.572 --> 54:11.568
No?

54:11.569 --> 54:15.552
Is.. anyone there?

54:21.713 --> 54:22.684
Hold on a bit.

54:22.685 --> 54:23.793
Be right back.

54:36.933 --> 54:38.413
Immature.

54:40.973 --> 54:43.579
Alright, alright, alright.
Michael.

54:43.580 --> 54:47.633
Since you're the what, the
genius on the Ouija-boards.

54:47.713 --> 54:49.243
Look, I just tried it.

54:49.244 --> 54:50.633
I don't believe it.

54:50.713 --> 54:52.133
It don't work.

54:52.313 --> 54:53.843
So that tells me.

54:53.844 --> 54:56.813
That you told Shay about Blair.

54:59.773 --> 55:00.973
Hold on.

55:03.353 --> 55:05.674
Hey. Who're there?

55:05.954 --> 55:07.479
Shay, is that you?

55:07.480 --> 55:10.950
Did you come back for daddy?
Hey, hey..

55:10.954 --> 55:11.994
Hey!

55:12.374 --> 55:13.386
Hey.

55:14.687 --> 55:16.014
Who're here?

55:16.694 --> 55:20.774
Look, I don't know karate,
but I know crazy.

55:23.194 --> 55:24.354
Hey!

55:30.254 --> 55:32.174
Ha!

55:34.454 --> 55:38.774
Michael, Michael, Michael!

55:39.114 --> 55:44.454
See man, I know you
told Shay about Blair.

55:44.555 --> 55:46.574
Because there ain't no
other way she would know.

55:47.474 --> 55:49.515
I tried the Ouija-board.

55:49.995 --> 55:51.252
I don't believe it.

55:51.253 --> 55:53.435
So you know what that tells me?

55:54.015 --> 55:56.135
That Ouija-board don't ...

56:16.675 --> 56:18.835
Yah. I'm setting it up right now.

56:21.815 --> 56:24.215
Okay. Go ahead.

56:24.935 --> 56:26.335
Slow down.

56:28.215 --> 56:29.376
Whose in your house?

56:29.377 --> 56:32.335
I have been hearing stuff,
but nothing like that.

56:32.415 --> 56:34.876
Come on La'Nette. There
has been a lot going on.

56:35.456 --> 56:37.515
Yah, like the Ouija
board and the fighting.

56:37.516 --> 56:39.996
Are you sure maybe you didn't
hallucinated a little?

56:40.776 --> 56:41.876
Okay, okay.

56:41.877 --> 56:44.676
You didn't hallucinate it.

56:45.596 --> 56:46.594
Oh, Shay also.

56:46.595 --> 56:49.376
So I talked to Brandon
earlier today.

56:49.456 --> 56:50.333
Long story short.

56:50.334 --> 56:51.985
Basically, he was saying that,

56:51.986 --> 56:54.256
there is a connection
through all of this.

56:54.536 --> 56:58.236
And I think, that could be it.
I do not know.

56:58.416 --> 57:00.536
I mean I found my own stuff out.
I did some research

57:00.537 --> 57:03.056
and I found something out
that's very creepy today.

57:03.096 --> 57:05.046
Yah, alright.
So you know Gracie?

57:05.047 --> 57:07.216
The little girl you
think you saw.

57:07.496 --> 57:10.520
The little girl you
saw in your house.

57:10.521 --> 57:11.276
Yah.

57:13.536 --> 57:14.981
She..

57:14.982 --> 57:16.504
actually died,

57:17.305 --> 57:18.160
on my birthday.

57:18.261 --> 57:19.537
April 29.

57:19.617 --> 57:21.837
Your birthday. Our birthday.

57:23.617 --> 57:26.925
Yah. I don't know.
I don't know if it means anything.

57:26.926 --> 57:28.457
I doubt it. But still..

57:29.837 --> 57:32.212
Yah, I'll keep the camera going.

57:32.213 --> 57:33.697
Yes, all the time.

57:34.177 --> 57:36.497
Yes, it's on right now.

57:37.477 --> 57:39.093
Alright, you'll do the same.

57:39.494 --> 57:41.624
And Shay's going to do also.

57:41.625 --> 57:42.457
Okay.

57:42.997 --> 57:46.877
Alright I guess, If you see
something, just let me know.

57:47.757 --> 57:48.675
All right.

57:48.676 --> 57:50.877
Alright, bye La'Nette.

57:52.337 --> 57:53.577
Jesus ...

57:59.753 --> 58:02.780
You need to clean up your bows too.
You've been playing

58:02.781 --> 58:05.753
with them too long.
You need to get the dirt outside.

58:06.078 --> 58:08.495
Do they know how to swim?

58:08.496 --> 58:10.778
They swim forwards
and backwards?

58:18.918 --> 58:21.118
Alright I don't
know what it was,

58:21.119 --> 58:23.318
but I heard something
back there.

58:24.098 --> 58:26.078
Let's see if I can find out what it is.

58:33.778 --> 58:36.858
- They swim forward and backward?
- Yes.

58:36.938 --> 58:38.843
So, you taught them
how to swim huh.

58:38.844 --> 58:41.091
Uh huh.
They..they know how to swim.

58:41.092 --> 58:43.338
But the other day, but then
I taught them more.

58:43.418 --> 58:46.428
Yah. Well, that's pretty good.

58:46.429 --> 58:50.039
You're smart.
You are a smart kid.

58:52.919 --> 58:54.259
What the *uck?

58:56.139 --> 58:57.919
What the hell is this?

59:05.819 --> 59:07.319
What the hell?

59:10.559 --> 59:12.799
Oh man. This is too weird.

59:17.719 --> 59:19.039
Oh Jesus!

59:19.119 --> 59:21.719
All right. I hope you guys are seeing this.

59:21.999 --> 59:25.679
I don't know what's going on,
but this is some really weird shit.

59:29.959 --> 59:31.159
What was that?

59:47.480 --> 59:49.060
Hello?

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:25.401
- Go up!
- Whoa !

01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:28.721
- What I got to do?
- Do not touch that.

01:00:28.801 --> 01:00:32.071
- I will hit your hands with
a yard stick young man!

01:00:32.072 --> 01:00:33.181
- Really? - Yes.

01:00:33.961 --> 01:00:34.939
You are so weird.

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:37.101
Boarding school 101.
Just to be bored.

01:00:37.181 --> 01:00:38.856
Hey, can I watch
over here thou?

01:00:38.857 --> 01:00:40.961
Yes of cos.
That's what it is there for.

01:00:41.041 --> 01:00:43.134
Uu... Where is the
popcorn extra butter!

01:00:43.135 --> 01:00:45.081
- Come on. Just pay attention.
- Okay.

01:00:45.161 --> 01:00:45.790
Alright, here we go.

01:00:45.791 --> 01:00:46.694
I'm sorry okay. It's
just really really weird.

01:00:46.707 --> 01:00:47.621
It's okay.

01:00:47.701 --> 01:00:51.581
- Okay. So I just..  Yah, alright.
Now go ahead.
- Don't scare me.

01:00:52.041 --> 01:00:57.201
- Here.
- I just heard something back there.

01:00:57.381 --> 01:00:59.581
This is right after I heard the noise.

01:00:59.661 --> 01:01:01.548
This is good stuff
you got here.

01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:04.942
Just... watch. Fast...
will you fast forward to this..

01:01:06.622 --> 01:01:07.982
Okay, right here!

01:01:08.062 --> 01:01:09.750
This is where the
pink stuff is?

01:01:09.751 --> 01:01:11.122
- Yah, watch!
- Okay.

01:01:14.242 --> 01:01:15.292
Look at...

01:01:15.293 --> 01:01:17.042
That ain't pink.

01:01:18.022 --> 01:01:21.913
What.. What the hell is this?
No, that 's not right.

01:01:21.914 --> 01:01:24.042
No, that was all different.

01:01:24.122 --> 01:01:25.513
You have a hamper
under the commode.

01:01:25.514 --> 01:01:27.647
Dude. That was all different.
Everything on this.

01:01:27.648 --> 01:01:28.673
Everything was different.

01:01:28.674 --> 01:01:30.642
Look, all these were pink.
The towel was pink.

01:01:30.722 --> 01:01:32.342
What the hell?

01:01:34.722 --> 01:01:36.902
What?
I know what I saw!

01:01:38.082 --> 01:01:39.082
Okay.

01:01:39.262 --> 01:01:41.394
Alright. I don't know if
you guys can see this ...

01:01:41.395 --> 01:01:42.762
Right here.. Watch the door.

01:01:42.842 --> 01:01:43.648
Okay, I'm watching.

01:01:43.649 --> 01:01:45.722
- Something came into the bathroom.
- I'm watching.

01:01:45.746 --> 01:01:46.601
There!

01:01:48.302 --> 01:01:49.228
There is more.

01:01:49.229 --> 01:01:51.543
No, there is more,
there is more.

01:01:51.623 --> 01:01:53.963
No, that's it. That's all there is.

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:56.463
No, there's more!
Go back, go back!

01:01:59.663 --> 01:02:01.483
Here?
Yah, watch!

01:02:02.263 --> 01:02:03.063
No?

01:02:03.064 --> 01:02:06.263
Okay, let's just go
backs, let's just..

01:02:06.343 --> 01:02:09.503
- La'Nette?
- I'm not seeing anything. I'm trying.

01:02:09.583 --> 01:02:10.860
Can you slow it down?

01:02:11.161 --> 01:02:12.663
Frame by frame.

01:02:14.563 --> 01:02:16.083
Now, that's weird.

01:02:20.043 --> 01:02:23.103
No. I know what I saw.
Okay.

01:02:23.183 --> 01:02:25.314
Right then something
walks into the bathroom.

01:02:25.315 --> 01:02:26.583
It's not there man.

01:02:26.663 --> 01:02:29.368
And there is no more?
Cos there's more afterwards too.

01:02:29.369 --> 01:02:29.948
That's it.

01:02:29.949 --> 01:02:32.263
I went into the hallway
and there is this...

01:02:32.543 --> 01:02:34.864
On that note, I want to go
to the little girl's room.

01:02:34.865 --> 01:02:36.971
Something a little more
exciting may take place.

01:02:36.996 --> 01:02:37.768
Good luck to you.

01:02:37.824 --> 01:02:39.587
You believe me, right?

01:02:39.588 --> 01:02:42.524
Of course, I believe you.
Of course.

01:02:43.004 --> 01:02:44.104
Thanks.

01:02:47.384 --> 01:02:49.175
Alright,

01:02:49.176 --> 01:02:51.264
so I want you all to see this.

01:02:51.544 --> 01:02:52.822
After last night,

01:02:52.823 --> 01:02:54.260
I know you all think I am crazy.

01:02:54.261 --> 01:02:55.964
But I know what I saw, alright.

01:02:56.044 --> 01:02:58.833
"A spirit might tell the
truth about the future

01:02:58.834 --> 01:03:01.564
event or past to gain the
trust of the user. "

01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:03.967
"And never use the Ouija
in a grave yard or

01:03:03.968 --> 01:03:06.184
place where terrible
death had occurred."

01:03:06.264 --> 01:03:10.344
Playing in these places might
cause terrible manifestations. "

01:03:10.924 --> 01:03:13.007
This is really important thou.

01:03:13.008 --> 01:03:16.964
"Some believe that certain
spirits remain on our plane"

01:03:17.144 --> 01:03:21.085
And contact the living for the purpose
of relaying certain messages.

01:03:21.165 --> 01:03:25.085
"Those messages usually pertain to
unresolved conflicts or issues"

01:03:25.365 --> 01:03:31.165
"Now these spirits, can range
from being gentle or passive - "

01:03:31.645 --> 01:03:36.385
- by noises, voices or even
appearing into the users.

01:03:36.425 --> 01:03:39.730
To forceful or aggressive,
by moving things

01:03:39.731 --> 01:03:42.885
or even physical contact
with the living.

01:03:43.265 --> 01:03:45.845
"Others also believe that ..."

01:03:47.505 --> 01:03:48.616
Something just happened.

01:03:48.617 --> 01:03:50.005
There's a noise in the back.

01:04:04.586 --> 01:04:06.626
Gracie? Is it you?

01:04:31.446 --> 01:04:32.922
Calvin!

01:04:35.423 --> 01:04:36.845
Where are you?

01:04:37.646 --> 01:04:38.826
Where is Blair?

01:04:39.646 --> 01:04:42.006
What is she doing here?

01:04:43.526 --> 01:04:47.267
You have a lot of explaining to do to me.

01:04:49.447 --> 01:04:52.607
What's this?

01:04:56.527 --> 01:04:58.567
Is this even on?

01:05:03.867 --> 01:05:05.059
Calvin?

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:07.107
Why are you calling me?

01:05:07.187 --> 01:05:08.795
I knew it was you.

01:05:09.496 --> 01:05:10.297
What ?

01:05:10.298 --> 01:05:14.227
Gracie and I are just getting ready
for our weekend trip as a family.

01:05:14.407 --> 01:05:15.587
Is this Blair?

01:05:15.988 --> 01:05:17.947
Why are you playing games?

01:05:18.027 --> 01:05:20.587
Don't be silly.
Don't talk like that.

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:22.223
Where is Calvin?

01:05:22.224 --> 01:05:24.947
Put him on the phone. Now!

01:05:25.027 --> 01:05:26.420
You know what?

01:05:26.421 --> 01:05:29.307
That's it. I'm coming over.

01:05:42.608 --> 01:05:44.248
What's this?

01:05:46.872 --> 01:05:47.872
Calvin?

01:06:01.968 --> 01:06:03.328
Hey!

01:06:17.928 --> 01:06:19.889
What is going on?

01:06:30.869 --> 01:06:34.569
Stop gooffing around. This isn't funny.

01:06:36.389 --> 01:06:38.189
We need to talk.

01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:45.049
Calvin?

01:06:46.129 --> 01:06:47.767
Baby, what is it?

01:06:49.068 --> 01:06:50.577
Are you OK?

01:06:52.078 --> 01:06:53.129
You can tell me.

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:54.349
What is it?

01:06:57.073 --> 01:06:58.573
You Okay...?

01:07:05.497 --> 01:07:06.597
(Scream) Ahh....!

01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:15.470
Gracie?

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:47.611
Gracie? Is that you?

01:07:51.511 --> 01:07:53.649
I see you, Gracie!

01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:55.431
Ready or not.

01:07:59.131 --> 01:08:00.171
Yah!

01:08:03.011 --> 01:08:04.031
Whoa.

01:09:53.792 --> 01:09:55.153
Huh!

01:09:56.033 --> 01:09:59.553
'Turn back now. Before it is too late.'

01:09:59.633 --> 01:10:03.654
'If not, may you rest in peace.'

01:10:14.094 --> 01:10:15.294
What is that?

01:10:20.074 --> 01:10:21.154
(Scrapbook)

01:10:26.294 --> 01:10:31.214
'Girl Dies in Drowning'
'Drown Girl's Mother Found Dead'

01:10:35.474 --> 01:10:38.554
'Girl Dies in Drowning'

01:10:38.555 --> 01:10:41.634
It looks like Gracie... Gracie Mendoza.

01:10:45.614 --> 01:10:48.109
I'm getting sick.
Well, what's going on?

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:49.855
Look, we're on our
way to Calvin's house.

01:10:49.935 --> 01:10:51.572
We have to burn the board.

01:10:51.573 --> 01:10:53.075
Calvin..? First of all, wait.

01:10:53.155 --> 01:10:55.886
You are not driving anywhere
with me, holding the camera.

01:10:55.887 --> 01:10:56.875
Now what's going on?

01:10:57.155 --> 01:10:58.581
- April 29.
- Yah, my birthday.

01:10:58.582 --> 01:10:59.915
That's when Gracie died.

01:10:59.995 --> 01:11:01.860
Look, 44 days later, on June 12

01:11:01.861 --> 01:11:03.459
That's when Joseph died.

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.955
No, Joseph got shot that day.

01:11:06.035 --> 01:11:08.843
No, no. Joseph was in a coma
after the gunshot.

01:11:08.844 --> 01:11:11.475
He died on June 12,
which is Shay's birthday.

01:11:11.555 --> 01:11:13.421
Shay?
Calvin's girlfriend Shay?

01:11:13.422 --> 01:11:14.995
- Yes
- Oh my God.

01:11:15.075 --> 01:11:18.740
Oh. And she got all freaked out about
how she kept saying she saw something.

01:11:18.741 --> 01:11:21.215
And I didn't know ...
Do you think she saw Joseph?

01:11:21.295 --> 01:11:23.674
Maybe, I don't know.
But you know what ties this all together?

01:11:23.675 --> 01:11:24.383
What ?

01:11:24.384 --> 01:11:26.435
1166 Cooper Street.

01:11:26.715 --> 01:11:29.315
1166.. what?   Cooper Street.
What..?

01:11:29.595 --> 01:11:31.191
What are you talking about?

01:11:31.192 --> 01:11:32.676
That's Michael's house.

01:11:32.756 --> 01:11:37.376
"Gracie Mendoza, 6 of Dallas,
died Friday, April 29 in east Dallas. "

01:11:38.056 --> 01:11:41.716
When was that?
1976?

01:11:42.836 --> 01:11:47.236
"Drown girl's mother found dead.
Lisa Mendoza... Lisa?

01:11:47.316 --> 01:11:50.524
Mother of Gracie Mendoza was
found dead in her kitchen

01:11:50.537 --> 01:11:53.756
by a family friend. At
around noon on Friday.

01:11:53.936 --> 01:11:56.664
" Also found in the home
was the bodies of daughter

01:11:56.677 --> 01:11:59.416
Gracie Mendoza and
neighbor Joseph Wheeler"

01:11:59.996 --> 01:12:01.476
Are you sure we are
at the right place?

01:12:01.477 --> 01:12:02.557
Of course I am.

01:12:02.558 --> 01:12:03.716
He's my brother, you idiot.

01:12:03.796 --> 01:12:05.944
Okay, So what are we getting
ready to do here exactly?

01:12:05.945 --> 01:12:07.716
We got to get the board,
we have to burn it.

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.740
Okay, get the board. Burn it.
Got it.

01:12:12.536 --> 01:12:14.056
Brother?

01:12:17.016 --> 01:12:19.078
Doesn't seems like
anyone's here..

01:12:19.079 --> 01:12:19.917
Calvin?

01:12:23.437 --> 01:12:25.797
- Huh.. !
- What? What is it?

01:12:27.077 --> 01:12:28.097
Brother?

01:12:30.521 --> 01:12:31.696
Brother?

01:12:32.197 --> 01:12:33.557
Calvin.

01:12:35.277 --> 01:12:36.857
Shay.

01:12:37.437 --> 01:12:38.936
Come, get up.

01:12:38.937 --> 01:12:40.897
Get up, please.

01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:42.621
Get. Ahh....!

01:12:45.237 --> 01:12:48.077
- No, not again.
- What was that?

01:12:50.257 --> 01:12:53.097
I don't want to go out there.

01:12:56.597 --> 01:13:00.797
Get the board. There's the board.
Get the board. Go get the board.

01:13:05.098 --> 01:13:07.881
What's going on in here?
Go.. go.. go..

01:13:07.882 --> 01:13:09.538
- We got to go.
- Go..!

01:13:10.618 --> 01:13:13.318
Let's go.
Let's get the hell out of here!

01:13:18.898 --> 01:13:21.778
"Mendoza murder investigation continues."

01:13:22.158 --> 01:13:26.178
"Mentally challenge neighbor suspected."
Joseph?

01:13:26.758 --> 01:13:30.262
"Fingers quickly point toward
Joseph Wheeler after test showed

01:13:30.287 --> 01:13:33.902
that Lisa Mendoza's DNA was found
on the knife in the kitchen. "

01:13:33.958 --> 01:13:36.998
"More in her daughter's drowning."

01:13:37.078 --> 01:13:40.818
Need to get the dirt outside
Do they know how to swim?

01:13:40.998 --> 01:13:42.042
- Yes,

01:13:42.043 --> 01:13:46.218
- Yah.
They swim forward and backward?

01:13:46.398 --> 01:13:48.915
- Yes.
- You taught them how to swim, huh?

01:13:48.916 --> 01:13:49.559
- Uh huh.

01:13:49.639 --> 01:13:51.007
They.. they know how to swim.

01:13:51.008 --> 01:13:53.319
But the other day, but
then I taught them more.

01:13:53.499 --> 01:13:56.254
Yah. Well, that's pretty good.

01:13:56.255 --> 01:13:59.559
You're smart.
You are a smart kid.

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:03.972
Andele (hurry up).

01:14:03.973 --> 01:14:06.039
Come on.
We need you all clean up.

01:14:07.099 --> 01:14:09.151
Let me get you behind your ears.

01:14:09.152 --> 01:14:11.779
You don't want to
make us late, do you?

01:14:12.259 --> 01:14:15.966
George has been planning on going
to his farm all month long.

01:14:15.967 --> 01:14:18.059
And he doesn't want
us to be late.

01:14:18.739 --> 01:14:21.779
All the chickens and goats
and baby ducks.

01:14:21.859 --> 01:14:23.540
Won't you like that?
All weekend?

01:14:23.541 --> 01:14:25.679
I don't want to go!

01:14:26.359 --> 01:14:27.180
Como Que no? (Why not)

01:14:27.181 --> 01:14:29.779
Of course
you want to go.

01:14:29.859 --> 01:14:33.500
Picnics and pony rides.
You're going to love it.

01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:35.047
He doesn't like me!

01:14:35.048 --> 01:14:38.260
Stop talking like that.
Of course he does.

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:41.900
That's nonsense. He loves me.

01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:44.020
He loves us.

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:46.780
And he wants this weekend to be perfect.

01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:50.257
So I don't want you acting
up and being a brat,

01:14:50.258 --> 01:14:53.300
and messing it up for me.
Do you hear me?

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.140
George is going to be here any minute so..

01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:59.920
We need to get you all pretty
with your new dress. Okay?

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.500
Can Joe come with us?

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.540
Joseph Wheeler next door?

01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:08.625
Honey, you got to
stop playing with him.

01:15:08.626 --> 01:15:10.260
I love playing with him.

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:11.867
Baby, he is stupid.

01:15:12.168 --> 01:15:15.140
And you need to
stay away from him.

01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:18.741
Has he ever touched you?

01:15:29.921 --> 01:15:30.881
Hello?

01:15:30.882 --> 01:15:33.521
Lisa. It's George.

01:15:33.601 --> 01:15:34.772
I know it was you.

01:15:34.773 --> 01:15:39.261
Gracie and I are just getting ready
for our first trip as a family.

01:15:39.541 --> 01:15:42.041
Lisa, I told you I can't.

01:15:42.042 --> 01:15:44.341
Why do you keep
bringing this up?

01:15:44.421 --> 01:15:47.081
I'm on call all weekend, you know this.

01:15:47.105 --> 01:15:48.399
I know you are on call, but..

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.960
you can be away
for a little bit.

01:15:49.961 --> 01:15:52.921
We can have a picnic go
and I can bake a pie.

01:15:53.001 --> 01:15:54.971
Lisa, stop it.

01:15:54.972 --> 01:15:59.081
You see. That's why, that's
why I am calling. I mean..

01:16:00.261 --> 01:16:02.953
Lisa. The reason I'm call is ...
because..

01:16:02.954 --> 01:16:05.582
I don't think this is
going to work out.

01:16:05.662 --> 01:16:07.067
Don't be silly.

01:16:07.068 --> 01:16:09.222
Don't talk like that.

01:16:10.362 --> 01:16:12.512
Gracie is going to be crashed.

01:16:12.513 --> 01:16:14.662
You don't want that, do you?

01:16:14.742 --> 01:16:17.054
And see.
That's , that's another thing. I..

01:16:17.055 --> 01:16:19.682
I don't think I'm ready to settle down.
I mean..

01:16:19.706 --> 01:16:21.061
I need time to do my own thing.

01:16:21.062 --> 01:16:22.368
And.. on top of that.

01:16:22.369 --> 01:16:25.602
I'm not really sure I'm
ready to be a father too .

01:16:25.982 --> 01:16:27.558
George,

01:16:27.559 --> 01:16:29.102
please..

01:16:30.382 --> 01:16:32.121
She loves you.

01:16:32.122 --> 01:16:33.602
She adores you.

01:16:33.603 --> 01:16:35.122
We both do.

01:16:36.502 --> 01:16:37.466
We ...

01:16:37.467 --> 01:16:41.322
She's all clean up
and ready to go.

01:16:43.462 --> 01:16:45.822
I'll see you around, bye.

01:17:35.844 --> 01:17:36.980
Look at you,

01:17:36.981 --> 01:17:38.784
You are still dirty.

01:17:39.464 --> 01:17:42.788
No matter how times
I bathe you .

01:17:42.789 --> 01:17:44.744
You're still dirty.

01:18:02.564 --> 01:18:03.784
Gracie?

01:18:20.485 --> 01:18:21.685
Gracie?

01:18:25.085 --> 01:18:26.545
It's me, Joe.

01:18:30.165 --> 01:18:32.925
Are we going to have a tea party?

01:18:45.845 --> 01:18:47.925
Gracie?

01:19:06.346 --> 01:19:09.506
Gracie, you need to get dress.

01:19:14.786 --> 01:19:16.706
Here, put this on.

01:19:19.266 --> 01:19:20.674
Gracie!

01:19:20.675 --> 01:19:22.686
Wake up.

01:19:30.546 --> 01:19:32.126
Gracie.

01:19:33.406 --> 01:19:35.326
Please.. wake up.

01:19:40.966 --> 01:19:42.966
Oh..
Oh no..!

01:19:44.726 --> 01:19:47.807
Gracie.
Please wake up.

01:19:55.207 --> 01:19:55.902
Joseph.

01:19:55.903 --> 01:19:57.987
Step away from her.

01:19:59.727 --> 01:20:02.327
What happened to Grace?

01:20:04.007 --> 01:20:08.667
She's not moving.
We need to call a doctor to help her.

01:20:09.147 --> 01:20:11.087
I said, step away from her.

01:20:16.207 --> 01:20:18.007
You did this.

01:20:18.687 --> 01:20:20.927
You killed Grace.

01:20:24.827 --> 01:20:26.827
I'm going to tell.

01:20:26.851 --> 01:20:28.604
l'm going to tell mom.

01:20:28.605 --> 01:20:31.551
I'm going to tell mom what you did.

01:20:36.488 --> 01:20:38.748
l'm going to tell mom.

01:20:39.528 --> 01:20:41.368
Joseph. Wait!

01:20:43.548 --> 01:20:45.208
Do you hear her?

01:20:47.788 --> 01:20:49.928
Do you hear her crying?

01:20:50.708 --> 01:20:52.588
Gracie?

01:22:13.770 --> 01:22:15.170
Oh, man.

01:22:15.250 --> 01:22:20.270
I know... I know who the killer is.
Oh, man.

01:23:02.194 --> 01:23:03.194
*uck.

01:23:14.051 --> 01:23:17.061
Okay. Okay, we are here now.
We're here, it's right over there.

01:23:17.062 --> 01:23:19.420
Alright, give me the
camera, give me the camera.

01:23:19.421 --> 01:23:20.391
Alright, let's go.

01:23:21.071 --> 01:23:22.131
Oh, my God.

01:23:22.211 --> 01:23:24.291
Come on.
We got to find Michael.

01:23:29.031 --> 01:23:30.611
Michael?

01:23:39.052 --> 01:23:40.592
Mike?

01:23:44.452 --> 01:23:46.452
Are you here?

01:23:49.512 --> 01:23:51.332
Shit.. say something.

01:23:55.032 --> 01:23:58.932
I don't know where else he can be.
It's only here.

01:24:02.392 --> 01:24:03.108
What ?

01:24:03.109 --> 01:24:05.972
What the heck ... was that?

01:24:12.192 --> 01:24:13.012
Hey!

Where is Brandon? Where is he?

01:25:33.965 --> 01:25:35.232
We have to burn the board.

01:25:35.533 --> 01:25:37.454
I know that, I know that.

01:25:39.094 --> 01:25:41.154

Okay, where's Brandon ?

Brandon's dead, Michael..

01:25:55.594 --> 01:25:56.295

01:25:56.319 --> 01:25:57.517
Brandon's dead.

01:25:57.518 --> 01:25:58.574
Oh, my god.

01:25:58.575 --> 01:26:00.515
Where is the board?

01:26:01.955 --> 01:26:03.715
It's near his head.

01:26:05.095 --> 01:26:06.170
We're going to go..

01:26:06.171 --> 01:26:07.755
and get the board, alright?

01:26:07.779 --> 01:26:08.634
Wait.. wait.. wait..

01:26:10.176 --> 01:26:10.826
We have to.

01:26:10.827 --> 01:26:12.262
