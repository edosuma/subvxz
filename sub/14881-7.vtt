00:03.703 --> 00:05.005
I think she's going to go see Todd.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.112
I'm going to e-mail this to Mom.

04:02.141 --> 04:03.376
This is going to kill me.

05:11.244 --> 05:12.345
That's absurd.

05:22.088 --> 05:23.623
We got to lock this door.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.414
It's pretty shocking.

07:42.495 --> 07:43.596
Is that possible?

08:03.182 --> 08:04.183
No, thank you.

08:04.784 --> 08:05.985
We'll have dinner later.

08:51.831 --> 08:54.534
Hi. How are you?

12:11.197 --> 12:12.665
Can I sit next to Mason?

12:13.399 --> 12:14.300
Yeah.

12:16.135 --> 12:17.470
Look what I'm doing.

12:17.536 --> 12:20.239
-Oh, my gosh, you're making music.
-Yeah.

13:30.242 --> 13:31.710
For a teenager.

14:05.010 --> 14:05.978
I'm not a little kid.

14:06.045 --> 14:09.481
I don't even f****** want to be
on these stupid family trips anyway.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.280
Scott, you're not leaving.

14:45.017 --> 14:47.019
I literally hate staying with this family.

15:08.274 --> 15:10.643
You're a rat. You're a real, like, snitch.

20:30.762 --> 20:32.364
So, like, here.

20:34.132 --> 20:37.536
So, like, I, could take off my thing
and lay, like, here.

21:11.303 --> 21:13.305
Want to learn how to shake your ass
in the water?

21:47.306 --> 21:48.240
Oh, no.

21:55.881 --> 21:56.715
Oh, no.

40:43.474 --> 40:46.010
Us dancing, like, just being cool.
