00:09.176 --> 00:10.632
LUCY: Previously
on Killjoys...

00:12.304 --> 00:14.010
What do you see
in those nightmares?

00:14.473 --> 00:16.464
And why does someone
here want you dead?

00:17.142 --> 00:18.518
PAWTER: Look, ifyou care
at all about yourself

00:18.602 --> 00:19.842
or your team,
you need to get help.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.598
Can you treat me?
What's in it for me?

00:21.688 --> 00:23.679
I don't like most doctors.
I like you.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.438
If you have any business
that you need squared away...

00:25.567 --> 00:26.602
|'|| square it away.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.524
Hello, little bird.
DUTCH: How did you find me?

00:28.612 --> 00:29.727
/ never let you go.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.322
From the time you
receive the box,

00:31.406 --> 00:33.488
you'll have one week
to do as I've asked.

00:34.076 --> 00:36.818
Khlyen wants you dead.
And I want to know why.

00:39.331 --> 00:41.037
DUTCH: I love you.
But you're an idiot.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.785
JOHN: l have a real
feel for asteroids.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.832
And I'm telling you,
the ship is behind that one.

00:47.256 --> 00:48.666
Okay, then.

00:49.716 --> 00:50.751
Fifty Joy.

00:50.842 --> 00:53.094
One, no one has
a feel for asteroids.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.714
And two, this is
the last time I take

00:54.805 --> 00:56.386
a C and C after
you've been
into the Hokk.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.972
LUCY: ID beacon
location confirmed.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.679
John’s selection of
asteroid is correct.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.386
Hey, Lucy always
takes your side.
You're her favorite.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.972
She's a systems
computer, Dutch.
She doesn't have favorites.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.648
LUCY: Correct again, John.

01:10.821 --> 01:13.733
Or we could make
this interesting.

01:15.659 --> 01:16.694

01:24.710 --> 01:26.621

01:32.384 --> 01:34.420
(COMPUTER BEEPING)
Damn it!

01:36.888 --> 01:39.675
Hey, our therapy session
was supposed to start
an hour ago, Jaqobis.

01:39.766 --> 01:40.801
Are you okay?

01:40.892 --> 01:43.383
Yeah, I lost
track of time. Sorry.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.055
Are you still having
the memory issues?

01:45.147 --> 01:46.182
I'm fine.
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:46.273 --> 01:47.934
A lot of people
with trauma don’t want

01:48.025 --> 01:49.606
to remember what
traumatized them.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.607
Maybe you aren’t
ready to try.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.185
No, it's, uh...

01:54.114 --> 01:55.399
It's just...
(KNOCKING)

01:56.700 --> 01:58.565
Hey, we found
an abandoned ship.

01:58.660 --> 01:59.740
Um...

01:59.828 --> 02:03.286
Pawter. I'm sorry.
I can, uh, come back.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.704
Um...

02:04.791 --> 02:06.122
Sorry. Duty calls.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.707
Next time.

02:09.463 --> 02:12.125
Is the ship's signal
coming from Arkyn?
Arkyn's empty.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.127
It's a dead moon,
thanks to the Company.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.341
We were passing
the Graveyard
when Lucy...

02:16.428 --> 02:17.463
The Graveyard?

02:17.554 --> 02:18.589
Asteroid belt.

02:18.764 --> 02:22.097
Lucy picked up
a repeating lD beacon,
over a decade old.

02:23.727 --> 02:24.842
Hey.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.061
You said Hokk Pong,
whoever wins gets
to go onboard first.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.138
You left. I made
an executive decision.

02:30.442 --> 02:33.024
(SCOFFS) You told me to go
get D'av to be a judge,
and then you scooped me?

02:33.320 --> 02:35.902
That was my decision.
It's a C and C warrant.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.149
Claim and...
Claim and clear.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.322
Any abandoned vessel found
in non-territorial space

02:39.409 --> 02:41.786
can be boarded by
any RAC agent
in good standing.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.953
Any and all items found
on said ship can be
claimed by said agent,

02:45.040 --> 02:46.200
after which time...

02:46.291 --> 02:47.906
He reads instruction
manuals, too.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.493
I don't know
who's more annoying,

02:50.587 --> 02:52.543
him or you having to
be first all the time.

02:52.631 --> 02:53.837
It's my thing.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.206
So, how are we boarding?

02:55.300 --> 02:57.461
Mobile bridge to the ship's
emergency airlock.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.510
I'll make sure that
life support's online.
You guys follow.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.429
Then, we grab
everything we can find.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.723
Lucy, decrypt
that beacon yet?

03:05.811 --> 03:09.804
LUCY: Affirmative.
The Aegir is classified
as a cargo ship.

03:09.898 --> 03:14.437
Planet of origin unspecified.
GWT of 20, 000.

03:14.736 --> 03:17.523
Grav weight of 20,000?
Must be hauling heavy.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.572
Right? Under no colors?
I mean, who knows
what we're going to find.

03:20.659 --> 03:21.990
John, why don't you
do the honors,

03:22.077 --> 03:24.113
what with your
"feel for asteroids."

03:24.246 --> 03:25.281
(CLICKS TONGUE) Oh.

03:26.581 --> 03:29.038
JOHN: All right, Lucy,
time for a little
treasure hunting.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.082
LUCY: With pleasure, John.

03:34.423 --> 03:35.583
JOHN: Whoa.

03:36.425 --> 03:37.835
LUCY: Airlock bridge
extended.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.137
Gravity at 96 percent.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.051
I'm in the mobile bridge.

03:56.445 --> 03:58.777
Approaching the Aegir’s
emergency airlock now.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.938
Well, that's great
to hear, Dutch.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.898
I'm so happy for you.
Really.

04:04.327 --> 04:07.410
Come on, Johnny.
First cool thing
I find is all yours.

04:08.206 --> 04:10.538
Lucy,anyluck
opening the airlock door?

04:10.751 --> 04:14.960
LUCY: Limited system
interface, unable to
override security protocol.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.253
Bet you'd find a way
if John was doing it.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.546
Dutch.

04:18.717 --> 04:21.754
All right, let's see
if the default
Company code works.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.961
(KEYPAD BEEPING)

04:25.015 --> 04:26.175
(ALARM BLARING)
Shit.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.884
LUCY:
Aegir security initiated.
Return to ship immediately.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.141
Dutch, get back here.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.436
You don't know what kind of
defense system this ship has.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.059
It could set off
thermals or a gas cloud.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.811
If they go off when
Lucy's opening

04:36.902 --> 04:38.813
her door for me,
we're all screwed.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.314
Setting a directional
charge.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.485
Dutch, what are you doing?

04:41.573 --> 04:43.234
If this bitch won't open
on her own, I'll make her.

04:43.325 --> 04:44.906
Dutch, no.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.195
(ALARM BLARING)

04:48.914 --> 04:50.074
LUCY: Charge deactivated.

04:50.165 --> 04:51.905
Dutch, what happened?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.080
I don't know.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.498
It just stopped.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.006
JOHN: /don’t like this.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.754
Lucy, scan again
for life forms.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.594
LUCY: Still reading
zero life forms.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.680
I'm in.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.683
Grav is online.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.856
Lucy, check the 02 levels
on my suit sensor.

05:19.069 --> 05:22.436
LUCY: Oxygen optimal.
No toxins detected.

05:24.658 --> 05:28.901
Well, all right, then.
Let's get this
party started, shall we?

05:30.705 --> 05:31.740
(SlGHS)

05:32.249 --> 05:34.661
Time for some
treasure hunting, boys.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.079
JOHN:
Well, Lucy’s plugged in.
We 7/ be right over.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.953
D'AVlN: Protocol says
we clear the ship,
then detonate it.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.296
So. Mines?

05:42.968 --> 05:45.050
Oh, yeah. Big ones.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.218
How can you
not love this job?

05:47.305 --> 05:49.261
Let's go find some
treasure and blow shit up.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.659
Come, come, come uninvited

06:11.872 --> 06:14.614
Run, run, run
till / find you

06:14.708 --> 06:17.415
I don’t care which side
that you’re fighting

06:17.502 --> 06:19.663
Gonna get you gone

06:20.589 --> 06:21.954
Best guess
what's onboard?

06:22.048 --> 06:23.504
Hard to say.
And that's assuming

06:23.592 --> 06:25.378
the ship pickers
haven't already
gotten to her.

06:31.474 --> 06:32.805
Look out, space rats!

06:36.479 --> 06:38.606
Grow up, Johnny.
Space rats? Really?

06:38.690 --> 06:40.931
Yeah, it's...
It's an old familyjoke.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.106
Hilarious.

06:42.319 --> 06:45.311
System status? Any idea
what happened to this rig?

06:45.864 --> 06:48.105
Plugged into
the top-level BIOS.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.905
Telemetric engine's cacked.

06:49.993 --> 06:52.985
The drive blew out
and the crew
hightailed it out.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.529

where she's from?

06:55.624 --> 06:57.489
Haven't seen any
markings I recognize.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.824
Beyond the Quad maybe?

06:58.919 --> 07:01.376
Planet of origin
info should be printed
on the transponder,

07:01.463 --> 07:03.294
which we will need
for proof of our claim.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.965
So, you go find
the transponder,
Sugar Pants.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.633

the explosives,

07:08.720 --> 07:10.256
while I go look
for some booty.

say something?
No.

when I find
something pretty.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.918
You know, there were
never any actual space rats.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.288
Dad just made them up
to scare you away
from the junkyard.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.498
Me?

07:47.634 --> 07:50.376
I thought he made them up
to keep you from joining
Nova Cadets.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.210
Well, didn't exactly work
for either of us, did it?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.296
Yeah, like pretty
much everything he did.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.515
But, hey.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.268
He was just trying his best
like we all do, right?

08:01.773 --> 08:03.604

have a moment, John?
No.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.339

the transponder,

08:30.427 --> 08:32.338
and then we should go see
if we can go find something

11:42.160 --> 11:44.401
Buddy, do not even think
of entering my ship.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.113
What the...

11:49.292 --> 11:50.532
I don't understand.

11:52.587 --> 11:53.872
Stop. What are you doing?

12:05.725 --> 12:07.056
Lucy, do not open...

12:07.727 --> 12:08.887
No!

12:09.062 --> 12:10.097
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

12:12.315 --> 12:13.350
Lucy.
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

12:13.441 --> 12:17.275
Lucy, return to ship
and re-engage. Acknowledge.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.560
Lucy. This is Dutch.
Acknowledge.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.737
JOHN: Somebody talk to me.
Anybody.

12:22.367 --> 12:23.607
John? Where are you?

12:23.701 --> 12:25.407
Dutch. Lucy went
into quarantine.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.360
I can't get a response.
She retracted the bridge.

12:27.455 --> 12:28.911
What the hell is going on?

12:30.083 --> 12:31.573
l have no idea.

12:33.461 --> 12:36.077
JOHN: Lucy's barely
50 meters away.
But without a bridge,

12:37.382 --> 12:38.838
she might as well be 50,000.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.041
Why can't we get her
to respond?
Why won't she come back?

12:41.135 --> 12:43.797
I don't know.
It's like she sensed
some kind of contamination

12:43.888 --> 12:45.219
and went into
full quarantine.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.051
That’s deeply unnerving.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.882
Plus, my deep suit's
gone missing.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.931
At least our comms
are working again.
Thanks for that.

12:52.063 --> 12:54.679
And I do have full access
to all the security
cam feeds.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.856
And I'm working on
access to Lucy now.

12:56.985 --> 12:58.600
Be careful with that
guy D’avin apprehended.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.609
We're just about
to interrogate him.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.693
You want to tell us
what's going on, Mister...

13:05.660 --> 13:06.695
Hogan.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.778
We were just
ship pickers.
Me and Wilson.

13:09.872 --> 13:13.410
HOGAN: We picked up a beacon.
Same as you. Cargo ship.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.085
Origins unknown.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.254
Sounded like a big payday.

13:17.672 --> 13:20.709
Once we boarded,
our ship's
anchor line retracts.

13:21.509 --> 13:25.422
No way back. No engines.
No comms. Nothing.

13:25.722 --> 13:26.802
How long ago was this?

13:27.974 --> 13:29.965
(SlGHS) Couple of years,
maybe. More.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.094
You lose track.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.808
We would have been happy
to get you out of here

13:32.895 --> 13:35.386
if your pal wasn't too busy
trying to hijack my ship.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.097
Lady, you see what
he did to my leg?

13:38.818 --> 13:42.231
His fingers?
Poor bastard was spaced.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.862
Seen enough of it
in the service.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.234
D'AVlN: You an officer?

13:46.326 --> 13:48.066
I worked for a living, son.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.198
Infantry. First and Seventh,
Howling Mavs.

13:51.289 --> 13:55.157
The Mavs, from Korel.
You guys were in
the ass end of the 'J'.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.957
Skyborne.
Royal Syndicate.

13:57.045 --> 13:59.878
Well, you don't say.
Cavalry has arrived.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.295
Lead on, son.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.542
D'av.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.801
Before we go
bringing this guy onboard,
what's your gut on him?

14:10.892 --> 14:12.848
Considering how long
he's been stranded?

14:12.935 --> 14:14.846
I'm not sure
I'd be any better off.

14:15.563 --> 14:16.848
Plus, he's infantry.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.895
They're usually not known
for their personalities.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.936
I heard that.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.689
But as soon as you're done
insulting my beloved corps,

14:23.780 --> 14:26.647
maybe we want to figure out
how to get
the hell off of this coffin.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.234
I'm all ears.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.988
We have no contact
with our ship,
and my deep suit's gone.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.990
It must have been Wilson.

14:33.331 --> 14:37.620
Well, lstill got
the ones me and Wilson used
when we first boarded.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.951
You have deep suits,
and you never used
them to get away?

14:40.046 --> 14:43.709
Ship was gone,
so where to?
The nearest rock?

14:43.800 --> 14:45.381
Here. Let me show you
where they are.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.344
Oh. Sorry.

14:47.929 --> 14:49.760
Leg. Damn it.
You need that looked at.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.129
You got an infirmary on board?

14:51.224 --> 14:52.839
Yeah, yeah, but it's...

14:53.101 --> 14:54.682
It's on a lower deck.

14:55.103 --> 14:58.061
Suits are on
upper level, aft.

14:58.523 --> 15:02.107
Look, I'll take
Mr. Hogan to the infirmary.
Get him patched up.

15:02.193 --> 15:05.026
You go get the suits.
We meet back up
in the engine room.

15:07.532 --> 15:10.319
Omega clearance required.
Oh, you...

15:10.993 --> 15:13.370
Fine. Be that way.

15:20.461 --> 15:21.496
(COMPUTER BEEPING)
Mmm-hmm.

15:24.507 --> 15:25.542
(SlGHS)

15:26.968 --> 15:28.424
Hey, hey. Hang on.

15:30.221 --> 15:32.758
Dutch? I think
I got something here.

15:33.683 --> 15:34.843
Any luck with Lucy?

15:35.309 --> 15:37.516
Not yet. I’m resetting
the ship’s signal systems.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.519
But I don't think
that this is
a cargo vessel at all.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.721
What does "lMUR"
mean to you?

15:41.816 --> 15:44.899
Imperial Marines of
the United Republic,
out near the rim.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.317
Exactly. And that's
why there's no cargo.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.439
lt's military.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.236
Military.
What kind of mission?

15:49.323 --> 15:51.655
I'll go through the logs
while the array resets.

15:51.742 --> 15:55.405
Well, just do it fast.
As soon as | find these
deep suits, we are off.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.330
Dutch?

16:00.251 --> 16:01.331
You okay?

16:01.836 --> 16:03.167
Stand by.

16:03.629 --> 16:06.871
I thought the old man
said the infirmary was
on the lower deck.

16:13.598 --> 16:14.633
(EXHALES)

16:18.936 --> 16:21.973
Any chance
you can put the heat
on in the infirmary?

16:22.940 --> 16:24.225
The room's an icebox.

16:24.775 --> 16:27.767
JOHN: Sure. Soon as
I’m done with the logs
and reconnecting to Lucy.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.399
Hey, you want me
to make you some lunch, too?

16:30.490 --> 16:32.026
That would be nice.

17:08.486 --> 17:09.692
HOGAN: Always amazes me.

17:10.404 --> 17:14.864
Meet a new guy,
serves on another planet,
whole other system even.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.907
Same jokes, same crap.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.155
Military's nothing
if not predictable.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.282
What about you?

17:21.374 --> 17:26.289
Ah! You know. Same old story.
Looking for fame and fortune.

17:27.421 --> 17:28.922
Nice, safe retirement.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.833
And now that
we have received
the final batch,

17:33.928 --> 17:37.091
/ am very excited
to begin our first
procedure on live subjects.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.634
Oh, just over there, please.

17:39.725 --> 17:40.885
Stop.

17:43.813 --> 17:44.973
What?

17:45.231 --> 17:46.437
Hogan.

17:48.609 --> 17:49.644
Oh!

17:50.444 --> 17:52.480
My guys all told me
it was a dumb idea.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.315
Miss those idiots.

17:55.366 --> 17:56.572
Well, you know
what they say.

17:56.659 --> 17:59.822
You join for your nation,
but you stay for your squad.

18:02.540 --> 18:03.825
It's all right, son.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.244
You're here now.

18:06.711 --> 18:10.374
Whatever you were
looking for,
this is the answer.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.172
Excuse me?

18:13.259 --> 18:15.170
JOHN: D’av, it’s John.
Don’t respond.
Just listen.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.840
Trust me.
This old guy
is not what he says.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.967
Get to the engine room, now.
Give me a signal you copy.

18:21.058 --> 18:24.016
How is this ship
for space rats?

18:24.395 --> 18:26.101
Hmm. Nice.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.471
See you soon.
Space rats?

18:28.649 --> 18:30.560
The hell you
talking about?
Sorry.

18:30.651 --> 18:33.393
Old Skyborne slang.
We got a problem
in the engine room.

18:33.487 --> 18:34.647
The sooner I can
swing by there,

18:34.739 --> 18:36.195
the sooner we can get you
to the infirmary.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.410

to the engine room. Why?

19:35.925 --> 19:37.790
How deep is
this engine room?

19:38.344 --> 19:39.504
Don't worry.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.631
When we get there,
you'll understand.

24:39.228 --> 24:41.640
It's the ship's crew.
What the hell
did this to them?

24:41.730 --> 24:44.187
That cloud,
it's like some
kind of drug?

24:44.400 --> 24:47.984
What kind of drug
puts a hole in your head?
Or these other ones.

24:48.070 --> 24:50.152
These people died from
massive brain trauma.

24:51.073 --> 24:52.563
D'av? Dutch, it's him.

24:55.869 --> 24:56.904
DUTCH: Where is that?

24:57.037 --> 24:58.072
I don't know.
The feed's blanked.

24:58.163 --> 25:01.496
This is just what's
coming through raw.
Come on, give me some sound.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.992
D'AVlN: No, wait.
Please don’t.

25:04.086 --> 25:05.417
We have to go.
We have to get him.

25:05.546 --> 25:07.082
Yes, we do. Butwe
don't know where he is.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.829
And we don't know
what the hell is
happening to him.

25:09.008 --> 25:12.091
That console is our
only link to him. Use it.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.422
Stop. I don't know anything.
There's no point.

25:14.596 --> 25:16.848
The captain said
the same thing.

25:16.932 --> 25:20.845
"I don't know what happened.
It was an accident.
You'rejust a guard."

25:20.936 --> 25:23.222
So, I showed him the way.
Gave him his turn.

25:23.439 --> 25:24.849

25:24.940 --> 25:26.271
No! I helped him.

I was scared, too.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.429
Oh, yeah?
What do you know?

26:04.146 --> 26:07.434
You start with
simple questions.
Then, you get personal.

26:07.733 --> 26:08.973
Looking for weak spots.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.808
Good. That's right.

26:10.944 --> 26:13.105
Until you break them down.

26:13.989 --> 26:17.823
So, then, you know
there's no point
lying about anything.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.327

26:21.288 --> 26:22.824
Unless you've got
something to hide.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.122

There was nothing.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.226

I can't.

26:50.484 --> 26:52.020

I can ’t.

26:52.402 --> 26:55.360

I can't!
I mean I can't remember!

26:55.489 --> 26:57.650
I don't know
what it was about
or how it started!

26:57.741 --> 26:59.356
Then, what do you remember?

26:59.993 --> 27:02.405

I killed them!

shut down that machine.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.521

Follow me.

27:37.739 --> 27:39.275

I don't know.
Whatever it is, it...

27:55.215 --> 27:57.376
It breaks things down,
but then it builds
them back up again.

28:00.429 --> 28:01.760
It's her.
She might give
us something.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.763
This is Dr. Lyra Grange.
This is my final report.

28:05.767 --> 28:08.224

28:12.733 --> 28:14.598
It’s the head guard, Hogan.

28:14.735 --> 28:17.147
After the accident,
he completely decompensated.

28:17.279 --> 28:19.611
He lured the captain,
the crew,
there was a fight...

28:19.740 --> 28:23.449

You are currently in

28:23.619 --> 28:25.405

28:25.495 --> 28:26.655
There. Sublevel 1.
I'm going.

28:26.788 --> 28:27.994
No, I'm going.
He's my brother.

28:28.123 --> 28:30.705
John, you still need to
figure out what the hell
we're dealing with here.

28:30.792 --> 28:31.872
Dutch, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.496
He used the nanites
on all of us.

28:33.629 --> 28:34.618
Nanites.

28:34.755 --> 28:36.336
There's no way
to override them.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.001

program won’t stop.

28:38.133 --> 28:40.169
It just keeps going.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.179
There's no other way.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.129

28:48.518 --> 28:50.258
Well. That's one way
to beat it.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.236

28:58.320 --> 28:59.685
You figure out
how to shut it off?

WOMAN: Advances in
sub-microscopic technology

29:02.491 --> 29:04.948

to break down
any organic matter

29:05.035 --> 29:06.866
in ways that mimic
disease or trauma.

29:06.995 --> 29:09.111
We can't shut it off.
It's just microscopic robots

29:09.206 --> 29:12.164
programmed to tear us down,
and then build us up
again and again.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.533
I mean, it's the perfect
torture device, really.

29:14.670 --> 29:16.456
But the program running them,
when does it stop?

29:16.546 --> 29:18.047
That's the thing.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.879
The accident didn't
just ruin the engine.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.589
lt fried the whole system.
It's on a loop.

29:21.677 --> 29:22.883
Torture, heal,

29:23.011 --> 29:24.171

how to stop.

29:26.223 --> 29:27.929
So, unless we
destroy the program,

29:28.016 --> 29:30.678
the only way out
is to die faster
than it can fix you.

29:31.228 --> 29:32.809
That's why Mr. Crazy
went out the airlock.

trying to steal Lucy.

29:41.196 --> 29:43.983
I'm telling you,

29:44.366 --> 29:45.401
Unacceptable.

29:45.534 --> 29:46.569
Come on, son.

This is what it's all about.
We've all been there.

29:48.870 --> 29:53.034
What do you mean, "we"?
I'm the one on the inside
of this glass.

29:53.542 --> 29:58.002
You don't think
I'd spare myself, do you?
That would be very unfair.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.919

30:01.883 --> 30:03.384
Affirmative.

30:04.094 --> 30:06.426
Well, Idid.

30:08.432 --> 30:09.547
After the crew,

30:10.350 --> 30:13.012

took the coward's way out.

30:13.103 --> 30:14.559
l was the only one left.

30:15.564 --> 30:17.054
Every day, I'd come in.

30:18.525 --> 30:21.062
And every day,
he asked me
the same question.

30:21.737 --> 30:23.273
Red 17.

30:24.865 --> 30:26.355
And when I didn't answer...

30:26.575 --> 30:29.658
Okay. Okay, then. At least
tell me what Red 17 is.

what you're looking for?

30:39.379 --> 30:42.086
Shouldn't matter.
The program will know.

30:42.924 --> 30:44.755

30:45.761 --> 30:48.924

I didn't have the answer...

30:50.640 --> 30:52.426
One day, itjust...

30:54.936 --> 30:56.267

35:11.109 --> 35:12.895
When they're done fixing her,
they'll tear her apart again.

35:13.028 --> 35:14.859
There's no oxygen,
there's no time...

35:15.238 --> 35:17.024
COMPUTER: Prisoner 248—A.
(GROANlNG)

35:17.115 --> 35:20.699
You will now face
ongoing persuasion until
you return to your cell.

35:22.537 --> 35:24.528
I'm sorry.
But I love you.

35:24.623 --> 35:25.703
No, wait, don't.
(GUNSHOT)

35:26.207 --> 35:27.242
(GRUNTS)

35:27.375 --> 35:29.536
How was that in
any way loving me?

35:29.628 --> 35:32.210
Because it can't fix you
and torture you
at the same time.

35:32.297 --> 35:34.253
Massive injury
triggers the repair phase.

35:34.382 --> 35:36.088
Subject wounded.
Commencing reconstruction.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.206
See?

35:37.719 --> 35:39.584
And when they're
done fixing me?

35:42.641 --> 35:44.051
Fine, but give me the gun.

35:44.225 --> 35:47.433
Don't bother.
It won't help you.

35:48.563 --> 35:49.894
Oh, for the love of...

35:50.565 --> 35:52.101
How are you not dead?

35:52.567 --> 35:53.556
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

35:54.569 --> 35:56.901
Lucy, open the door
to the hold.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.229
LUCY: I’m sorry,
but quarantine
protocol states

35:59.324 --> 36:00.905
you must remain
in airlock one...

36:00.992 --> 36:03.028
Lucy, I'm in
serious pain here!

36:03.119 --> 36:04.950
There are protocols,
Dutch.

36:05.455 --> 36:06.490
(GROANS)

36:08.667 --> 36:10.623
Lucy, I need to
blow up that ship

36:10.752 --> 36:12.413
before these things
rip me a new one.

36:12.754 --> 36:16.463
I’m sorry, but
quarantine protocols state
you must remain in airlock

36:16.591 --> 36:18.752
one full hour before...
Lucy, John's in trouble.

36:20.929 --> 36:21.964
(EXHALES)

36:22.263 --> 36:25.755
No favorites, my ass.
I'm taking over,
you mechanical bitch.

36:25.975 --> 36:27.636
HOGAN: You belong here.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.767
You'rejust like me.

36:31.106 --> 36:32.596
No, I'm not.

36:32.941 --> 36:34.522
A good soldier.

36:34.943 --> 36:38.606
You killed your men, son.
You have to atone.

36:38.947 --> 36:42.439
Here, you can face the past.

36:43.368 --> 36:44.858
Remember what you did?

36:45.620 --> 36:46.609
(GRUNTS)

36:48.832 --> 36:50.618
That guy talks
way too much.

36:50.709 --> 36:51.789
DUTCH: I’ve connected
the bridge

36:51.876 --> 36:53.867
to the Aegir's airlock.
Let’s go.
Let's go.

36:54.295 --> 36:56.035
We've got to
get out to Lucy.

36:57.340 --> 36:58.375
(PANTlNG)

37:02.887 --> 37:05.629
JOHN: Dutch, we’re aboard.
Mines are about to blow.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.305
Everyone good?

37:07.726 --> 37:10.968
Ready? Body about to explode?

37:12.981 --> 37:14.221
Let's go.

37:22.157 --> 37:23.146
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

37:32.375 --> 37:33.831
How much longer, John?

37:34.043 --> 37:36.034
Decon gas has to get in deep.

37:36.296 --> 37:37.957
You know how many millions
of those things are in you?

37:38.047 --> 37:39.207
Fine.

37:42.552 --> 37:44.338
I swear
Lucy's enjoying this.

37:44.846 --> 37:47.087
LUCY: Decontamination
sequence complete.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.547
Finally!

37:49.058 --> 37:51.344
Session two will
commence in 10 minutes.

37:51.478 --> 37:52.888
Oh, come on.

37:53.146 --> 37:54.682
It’s not my fault
you’re filthy.

37:54.814 --> 37:56.145
Watch it.

38:02.489 --> 38:03.524
So.

38:07.827 --> 38:09.442
Just, whatever you
want to say, go ahead.

38:09.537 --> 38:10.697
Ask.

38:15.418 --> 38:16.498
VVhy?

38:16.586 --> 38:18.668
Like I said on the ship,
I can't remember
what I did...

38:18.755 --> 38:20.871
No, no, no, that's not
what I mean. I mean,

38:21.716 --> 38:23.252
why didn't you tell me?

38:23.510 --> 38:25.216
Why carry this
all on your own?

38:25.845 --> 38:27.005
Is this why you ran
away from all of us?

38:27.096 --> 38:28.256
John.

38:30.183 --> 38:31.764
You heard what I did.
Yeah.

38:33.228 --> 38:35.935
I can help,
D'av, I can do something.

38:36.231 --> 38:38.096
How are you going
to help me, John?

38:43.112 --> 38:45.068
Well, there's something
to figure out.

38:45.198 --> 38:47.029
There's something to fix.
I mean...

38:47.784 --> 38:49.775
I like fixing things,
remember?

38:50.787 --> 38:51.947
Yeah, I remember.

38:52.455 --> 38:53.740
Space rats.
(CHUCKLES)

38:54.916 --> 38:57.077
You know, you really
have to work
on your moments.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.956
Yeah.
But, John.

39:02.090 --> 39:03.546
Thanks.

39:12.809 --> 39:14.595
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

39:18.606 --> 39:19.982
You know, when you told me
to take my shirt off,

39:20.108 --> 39:21.894
this is not exactly
what I had in mind.

39:21.985 --> 39:23.145
Shut up, Jaqobis.

39:23.278 --> 39:24.768
You owe me a session.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.904
Last time I ran this,
you had scarring
all along the frontal cortex.

39:31.995 --> 39:33.576
I assumed it was trauma,
concussions.

39:33.663 --> 39:34.994
But now,
it's all cleared away.

39:35.123 --> 39:36.158
Well, I told you
what those things

39:36.291 --> 39:37.576
were doing to me,
fixing stuff.

39:37.667 --> 39:39.282
I know. But look here.

39:39.669 --> 39:42.832
All right, help me out.
I missed neuro class
in basic training.

39:43.089 --> 39:45.455
Here. Here. And here.

39:46.676 --> 39:50.840
Those are neuro dampeners.
Memory blockers.
Very sophisticated.

39:51.514 --> 39:52.754
How long have
they been there?

39:52.849 --> 39:54.009
Hard to say.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.684
Do you remember
having any surgery at all?

39:56.477 --> 39:57.466
No.

39:57.645 --> 40:00.261
Well, at least
now we know you don't
have traumatic amnesia.

40:00.481 --> 40:02.142
Someone doesn't
want you to remember.

40:02.358 --> 40:04.974
Great. I'm sick of
chasing dead ends.

40:05.486 --> 40:06.612
I need to know why.

40:06.696 --> 40:09.153
We will, okay?

40:11.117 --> 40:12.482
I promise.

40:15.163 --> 40:16.323
What?

40:18.833 --> 40:20.664
You seem different.

40:21.294 --> 40:23.535
Different better?
Or different worse?

40:25.882 --> 40:27.122
Let's find out.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.386
You didn't think
I'd fall for that
trick of yours, did you?

41:20.311 --> 41:22.518
It wasn't a trick.
It was a message.

41:22.897 --> 41:24.398
Here's another. Get out.

41:24.524 --> 41:25.684
I can't.

41:26.067 --> 41:27.307
I could make you.

41:27.402 --> 41:30.735
Oh, that would be fun.
But not today.

41:31.197 --> 41:32.232
Today, I need you.

41:32.365 --> 41:33.571
VVhy?

41:34.158 --> 41:38.367
Why are you here?
In my ship,
in my head, everywhere.

41:39.706 --> 41:41.492
Why can't you
just leave me alone?

41:43.042 --> 41:44.748
Because without me,

41:46.045 --> 41:47.251
you're becoming weak.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.671
Vulnerable.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.589
lam not vulnerable.

41:53.511 --> 41:54.591
No?

41:56.264 --> 41:57.879
Don't you even look at him.

41:58.349 --> 42:00.010
Oh, little bird.

42:00.601 --> 42:04.560
If I have to, I can do
so much more than just look.

42:07.108 --> 42:08.439
Get your things.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.520
We're going.
