00:02.306 --> 00:03.960
[female narrator]
Gossip Girl here,
your one and only source

00:04.047 --> 00:05.092
into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.179 --> 00:06.832
You must really want this.

00:06.919 --> 00:08.486
Yeah. Yeah,
I really, really do.

00:08.573 --> 00:09.618
Where's that story of yours?

00:09.705 --> 00:11.054
Noah Shapiro at
the "Paris Review"

00:11.141 --> 00:12.490
is looking forward to it.

00:12.577 --> 00:13.883
I-I know, I tried to write.

00:13.970 --> 00:15.754
You'll get no letter
of recommendation from me.

00:15.841 --> 00:17.321
[sighs]
I need a friend.

00:17.408 --> 00:19.932
I'm sorry, Lily, you made
your choice to be Mrs. Bass.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.325
You need to go do that.

00:21.412 --> 00:23.023
You're a born queen.
This is your year to rule.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.155
Being queen
is Blair's whole thing.

00:25.242 --> 00:27.636
Well, well.
Look who's back on top.

00:27.723 --> 00:28.811
I wonder how that happened.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.337
[gossip girl]
And who am I

00:33.424 --> 00:35.165
That's one secret
I'll never tell

00:36.775 --> 00:38.473
You know you love me

00:38.560 --> 00:40.214
XOXO

00:40.301 --> 00:42.520
Gossip Girl

00:42.607 --> 00:44.957
When the white tents blossom
in Bryant Park

00:45.045 --> 00:46.220
it can only mean one thing

00:46.307 --> 00:48.091
Fashion week.

00:48.178 --> 00:50.311
The time of year when
any Park Ave princess

00:50.398 --> 00:52.008
would trade
her last Prada pochette

00:52.095 --> 00:54.271
for front row seats
to the best shows.

00:54.358 --> 00:55.446
♪ ...New York City
where you gonna go ♪

00:55.533 --> 00:56.621
♪ with a head that empty ♪

00:56.708 --> 00:58.667
♪ Gone gone from New York City ♪

00:58.754 --> 01:00.712
♪ Where you gonna go
with the heart that gone ♪

01:00.799 --> 01:03.628
And we hear the seating chart
for Eleanor Waldorf's show

01:03.715 --> 01:06.240
is being made
by our very own B.

01:06.327 --> 01:08.329
This art director
just ran off

01:08.416 --> 01:10.461
with the husband
of this photo editor.

01:10.548 --> 01:12.202
So I sat all of "Vanity Fair"
between them.

01:12.289 --> 01:13.377
[sighs]

01:13.464 --> 01:14.726
I figured
we'd want to avoid

01:14.813 --> 01:16.728
a catfight in front
of the catwalk.

01:16.815 --> 01:18.556
I told Laurel,
my daughter could make

01:18.643 --> 01:21.603
a better seating chart than
that drug addled publicist.

01:21.690 --> 01:23.518
It's a blessing
she was hauled off to rehab

01:23.605 --> 01:25.650
for stealing
her son's Ritalin.

01:25.737 --> 01:27.739
I'm more than happy
to step in.

01:27.826 --> 01:30.568
And you and Serena will be
with me backstage, of course?

01:30.655 --> 01:32.135
Of course.
It's our tradition.

01:32.222 --> 01:33.919
Now I hope you don't mind,
but I sat the girls

01:34.006 --> 01:35.399
from school
in the second row.

01:35.486 --> 01:39.534
Well, since they are
your friends, why not?

01:39.621 --> 01:41.188
Besides, they'll worship
you for it.

01:41.275 --> 01:42.450
I know.

01:42.537 --> 01:44.016
[scoffs]

01:46.715 --> 01:48.195
Oh, school.

01:48.282 --> 01:50.545
Another day of reading,
writing and aristocrats.

01:50.632 --> 01:52.460
- You back to "Invisible Boy?"
- Invisible suits me.

01:52.547 --> 01:54.157
I can go
to school unshowered.

01:54.244 --> 01:56.420
I can forget to dress.
Nobody cares.

01:56.507 --> 01:57.813
And now I have all the time
in the world

01:57.900 --> 01:59.075
to focus on my
Yale application, so--

01:59.162 --> 02:00.294
Don't you mean Dartmouth?

02:00.381 --> 02:01.643
Yeah, well,
it seems that

02:01.730 --> 02:02.905
Dartmouth's whole
English department

02:02.992 --> 02:04.080
was poached by Yale.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.256
Wow. When's that
application due?

02:06.343 --> 02:07.692
Monday, Noah Shapiro's
helping me

02:07.779 --> 02:09.216
choose which stories
to submit.

02:09.303 --> 02:10.739
Wait. What happened
to that Jeremiah Harris guy?

02:10.826 --> 02:12.784
Oh, yeah. He, uh,
well, after he fired me

02:12.871 --> 02:15.004
I went ahead and sent
my story to Shapiro anyway

02:15.091 --> 02:16.179
and he, he-he loved it.

02:16.266 --> 02:17.354
That's great!

02:17.441 --> 02:18.616
Why haven't you told
me any of this?

02:18.703 --> 02:20.009
Well, I've barely seen you.

02:20.096 --> 02:21.880
You're always off
at your internship.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.186
Hey. You have French
first period.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.145
- Aren't you gonna be late?
- Uh..

02:25.232 --> 02:27.625
...uh, we have a sub,
and he always starts late, so..

02:27.712 --> 02:29.192
Okay. Well, I'm really late
for Italian

02:29.279 --> 02:31.151
so ciao, sorella mia.

02:32.195 --> 02:33.414
[cellphone ringing]

02:38.114 --> 02:39.420
Hi, Laurel?

02:39.507 --> 02:41.813
Yeah, it's me. Sorry.
I got stuck in traffic.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.685
I'll see you at Eleanor's
in five, okay?

02:45.382 --> 02:47.384
Kiki Smith greeting you
in the foyer.

02:48.951 --> 02:51.345
Elm and Drag pulling you
into the main room.

02:51.432 --> 02:52.998
I love that.

02:53.085 --> 02:56.611
And making a statement on the
stairwell, Richard Phillips.

02:58.308 --> 03:00.528
Hi, mom, I borrowed
your necklace.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.225
[Lilly]
'Oh, it's stunning.
Serena, do you think--'

03:02.312 --> 03:03.792
It's a necklace, mom.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.968
Oh, but I'm talking
about the art collection.

03:06.055 --> 03:07.839
Isn't it just breathtaking?

03:07.926 --> 03:09.276
Any museum
would be thrilled.

03:09.363 --> 03:10.625
Let's hope Bart
is when he gets back

03:10.712 --> 03:12.540
from Luxembourg this week.

03:12.627 --> 03:14.019
It's really great, mom.

03:14.106 --> 03:16.065
Your art consultant
has exquisite taste.

03:16.152 --> 03:17.632
You got in late
last night.

03:17.719 --> 03:21.026
Oh, yeah. I had the MoMA event
with, uh, Poppy.

03:21.113 --> 03:23.551
We were perfect ladies, though.
We sipped on sodas all night.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.509
Oh, Poppy Lifton,
the socialite?

03:25.596 --> 03:27.859
Yes, they met at
a charity affair the other week

03:27.946 --> 03:30.645
and they've been attached
at the hip ever since.

03:30.732 --> 03:33.865
- Now, for over here.
- Ah, yes, the Ryan McGinley.

03:33.952 --> 03:36.085
[Lily]
'Yes. Uh, something else.'

03:36.172 --> 03:38.522
There's a Mapplethorpe that's
coming up for auction, uh--

03:38.609 --> 03:40.959
Wait, Mapplethorpe,
isn't that the one

03:41.046 --> 03:42.918
who took all the pictures
of the naked guys?

03:43.005 --> 03:45.529
Yeah. Um, not just guys.

03:46.487 --> 03:48.271
Wait.

03:48.358 --> 03:50.273
- Mom, did you?
- Well.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.709
You modeled for Mapplethorpe?

03:51.796 --> 03:53.363
Well, I kept it a secret,
but I think

03:53.450 --> 03:54.799
you and Eric are old
enough now--

03:54.886 --> 03:56.540
No, but it's not
one of those artsy shots

03:56.627 --> 03:58.063
where you can't tell
if it's a belly button or a--

03:58.150 --> 03:59.935
Well, it's very tasteful,
I assure you.

04:00.022 --> 04:03.155
You just became the coolest mom
on the upper east side.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.635
Mm. Thank you.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.422
[Chuck]
'Ah, the besieged queen.'

04:08.509 --> 04:10.728
- What do you want, Chuck?
- To help.

04:10.815 --> 04:12.382
Your throne's in danger,
and you can't wage war

04:12.469 --> 04:14.645
on Serena without an ally.

04:14.732 --> 04:17.648
- You need me.
- There is no war.

04:17.735 --> 04:19.520
Now that Marcus has been
booted back to Brighton

04:19.607 --> 04:21.870
I'm free to focus
on my old life.

04:21.957 --> 04:23.567
Serena's just been
keeping my seat warm.

04:23.654 --> 04:26.657
And how do you plan on making
the girls fall at your feet?

04:26.744 --> 04:27.963
You going to trip them?

04:28.050 --> 04:30.444
A true monarch bestows favors.

04:30.531 --> 04:32.968
It's fashion week, and I'm the
only Constance girl with clout.

04:34.535 --> 04:36.188
Ladies..

04:36.276 --> 04:40.584
...I trust tomorrow night
you won't embarrass me.

04:40.671 --> 04:43.108
Oh, my God. Second row seats
to your mother's show?

04:43.195 --> 04:45.285
Oh, my God. Those are
total movie star seats.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.940
Serena is
in "Women's Wear Daily"...

04:49.027 --> 04:50.594
with Poppy Lifton.

04:50.681 --> 04:53.031
[chuckles]
Serena could, like, die now

04:53.118 --> 04:54.337
knowing that she's lived
a fulfilled life.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.296
[Serena]
'Hey, guys.'

04:56.383 --> 04:58.385
[Hazel]
'Oh, my gosh. Is Poppy nice?
She looks so nice.'

05:00.387 --> 05:01.736
Oh, gosh. I haven't
even seen that.

05:04.173 --> 05:06.393
Blair, where are you going?

05:06.480 --> 05:08.046
I'll just leave you
to your fans.

05:11.093 --> 05:12.877
So, when can I meet her?

05:12.964 --> 05:16.490
Watching you fail spectacularly
gives me so much joy.

05:16.577 --> 05:19.623
And you know what you give
to everyone, Chuck? Misery.

05:19.710 --> 05:21.538
There's a reason
you're always out here alone.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.888
Nate just happens to be away
at his grandparents'.

05:23.975 --> 05:26.238
Nate's only friends
with you out of habit.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.023
The only person
with fewer friends

05:28.110 --> 05:29.677
than you
is Dan Humphrey

05:29.764 --> 05:32.332
and at least his lame,
'90s dad likes him.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.899
And that's because he's
something you'll never be.

05:34.986 --> 05:36.248
A human being.

05:38.990 --> 05:40.992
Let me be blunt, Humphrey.

05:41.079 --> 05:43.343
These stories are no good.

05:43.430 --> 05:44.822
What?

05:44.909 --> 05:46.737
Uh, you-you-you said
my last one was--

05:46.824 --> 05:48.478
[Noah]
'It wasn't bad.'

05:48.565 --> 05:51.046
These are just
more of the same.

05:51.133 --> 05:52.656
[exhales deeply]

05:52.743 --> 05:53.962
Okay.

05:54.049 --> 05:56.268
[Noah]
'You sent me five stories.'

05:56.356 --> 06:00.055
All about a sheltered young man
with girl trouble

06:00.142 --> 06:02.666
'who lives with his daddy
in Brooklyn.'

06:02.753 --> 06:05.321
You think that's gonna knock
the Yale English Department

06:05.408 --> 06:07.454
off their tenured asses?

06:07.541 --> 06:09.847
I-I just-I thought a writer

06:09.934 --> 06:12.067
was supposed to write what he
knows. This is what I know.

06:12.154 --> 06:16.419
Then learn something new.
Get out of your comfort zone.

06:16.506 --> 06:17.986
A cardinal rule of writing.

06:18.073 --> 06:22.164
If your work's too safe,
do something dangerous.

06:22.251 --> 06:23.774
I-I wouldn't know
where to begin.

06:23.861 --> 06:25.559
Then find someone
who does know.

06:26.821 --> 06:28.562
'When I was young'

06:28.649 --> 06:31.260
Bukowski put a shot glass
on my head

06:31.347 --> 06:33.567
and blew it off
with a pistol.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.700
Find your Bukowski,
then get back to me.

06:39.703 --> 06:43.315
When I said "'50s hemline",
I meant like flirty Marilyn

06:43.403 --> 06:45.535
not long,
dowdy poodle skirt.

06:45.622 --> 06:46.928
I'm so sorry, Eleanor.

06:47.015 --> 06:49.060
[sighs]
Fix this thing before I faint.

06:49.147 --> 06:50.453
[Isabel]
'Eleanor.'

06:50.540 --> 06:52.412
This seating chart is weak.

06:52.499 --> 06:53.935
Where are all
our "It" girls?

06:54.022 --> 06:55.284
They're there. Look.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.417
Well, Kirsten Dunst?

06:57.504 --> 06:59.723
So2007.

06:59.810 --> 07:02.465
Her rehab stint
barely made the radar.

07:02.552 --> 07:05.599
Blair says we can't get
A-list girls

07:05.686 --> 07:08.253
because our show is
the same time as Marc Jacobs.

07:08.340 --> 07:11.039
But those girls bring press.

07:11.126 --> 07:13.520
Without them..

07:13.607 --> 07:16.174
Eleanor, Serena has
some new friends.

07:16.261 --> 07:18.829
- I bet she could help.
- New friends?

07:23.443 --> 07:24.748
[elevator bell dings]

07:27.272 --> 07:29.231
It's like the plague.

07:29.318 --> 07:31.146
Only instead of vermin
on my doorstep

07:31.233 --> 07:32.930
I get the "human being."

07:33.017 --> 07:35.498
Beat it, Humphrey. My sister
doesn't dig stalkers.

07:35.585 --> 07:37.892
Actually, as strange as it
sounds, I'm here to see you.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.371
I-I know we don't like
each other.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.722
You think I'm a boring,
sheltered nobody.

07:41.809 --> 07:43.027
I don't think of you.

07:43.114 --> 07:44.420
Oh, right. Of course
you don't. but, uh

07:44.507 --> 07:45.943
but I'vebeen
thinking of me

07:46.030 --> 07:47.641
and-and I've come
to the conclusion

07:47.728 --> 07:49.294
that I need to get
out of my comfort zone.

07:49.381 --> 07:51.688
I-I need to experience
new things.

07:51.775 --> 07:54.212
Are you gay?

07:54.299 --> 07:56.345
Now, that would be out
of my comfort zone, but no.

07:56.432 --> 07:59.174
Uh, I just need to get out
of Brooklyn for one night.

07:59.261 --> 08:01.219
I'd like to experience
the world of Chuck Bass.

08:04.309 --> 08:05.528
You're lucky, I'm bored.

08:07.225 --> 08:08.749
Is that a yes?

08:08.836 --> 08:10.577
Get in before
I change my mind.

08:18.193 --> 08:20.238
Don't ever go
to high school, Dorota.

08:20.325 --> 08:23.154
The girls are spoiled,
stupid and ungrateful.

08:23.241 --> 08:24.591
One snapshot
with a socialite

08:24.678 --> 08:26.941
and it's all,
"Serena! Serena! Serena!"

08:27.028 --> 08:28.246
Some tea
will calm your nerves.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.813
Don't they know
that without me

08:29.900 --> 08:32.250
they'd never see
the inside of a fashion tent?

08:32.337 --> 08:34.905
They'd be stuck behind
the barricades with PETA.

08:34.992 --> 08:37.342
In fact, I willleave them
outside with PETA.

08:37.429 --> 08:39.344
Maybe that'll teach them
some manners.

08:41.042 --> 08:43.174
[sighs]

of putting Serena

Poppy and her crowd

And Serena would
never watch the show

09:36.924 --> 09:38.142

but backstage with me.
