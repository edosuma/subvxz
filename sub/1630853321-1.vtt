your lunch money.

- Wait.

08:56.762 --> 08:58.111
What the police?

08:58.187 --> 09:00.096
Annie, what did he say
to do to the police?

09:00.115 --> 09:01.689
- He didn't.
Maybe respect them?

09:01.767 --> 09:02.932
Feed them? I don't know!

09:02.951 --> 09:05.026
- Somebody's putting bleeps
over words

09:05.045 --> 09:07.045
that are critical
to the artists' message!

09:07.122 --> 09:08.880
- But who?

09:09.032 --> 09:10.865
- It's the tight-ass wife

09:10.942 --> 09:13.200
of our computer nerd
vice-president!

09:13.220 --> 09:16.279
- Jack, you have crime
in your eyes.

09:16.339 --> 09:19.966
<i> - That night, we came back</i>
<i> to the store with a purpose.</i>

09:20.043 --> 09:22.209
- This feels like kind of
an overreaction, Jack.

09:22.229 --> 09:25.046
Can't we just, like,
buy the explicit version?

09:25.123 --> 09:27.807
- And trash our nails
peeling stickers off?

09:27.884 --> 09:30.794
Let's see 'em censor this!

09:30.812 --> 09:32.629

[siren chirps]

09:34.482 --> 09:37.967
- Be cool, my baby.
Let Jackie boy do the talking.

09:37.986 --> 09:41.228
Good evening, pigs.

09:41.306 --> 09:44.749

09:44.901 --> 09:47.160

- But we learned our lesson,
and we're model citizens today.

09:50.498 --> 09:51.497
Story over.

09:51.574 --> 09:53.425
- Wait, that doesn't
make sense, Mom.

09:53.501 --> 09:55.485
You tell us before bed
every night that if you have

09:55.503 --> 09:58.004
a criminal record, you can't be
in law enforcement.

09:58.156 --> 09:59.931
- And you are
in law enforcement.

10:00.008 --> 10:02.008
And I'm five,
and that don't add up.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.677
- Yeah, that don't add up.

10:04.754 --> 10:06.479
- [groans]

10:10.927 --> 10:12.852
- Wow, you own that island?

10:12.946 --> 10:14.929
- Actually, I split the rent
with the guy

10:14.948 --> 10:16.448
who invented the Scrub Daddy.

10:16.599 --> 10:17.449
You guys ready to jump?

10:17.600 --> 10:18.858
- Jump?
- Yeah, baby!

10:19.010 --> 10:20.452
We're dropping in
"Fornite" style!

Let's get it!

10:22.030 --> 10:25.439

10:25.533 --> 10:28.293
- This is how I'm traveling
everywhere from now on.

10:28.370 --> 10:31.296
- Listen, I'm not gonna be able
to work my shift today.

10:31.447 --> 10:35.050
I'm having lady issues.
Don't be sorry. It's okay. Bye!

10:36.786 --> 10:38.953
- "And crew." That's me.

10:39.030 --> 10:40.121
- Duncan, I am so proud of you

10:40.215 --> 10:41.956
for keeping your
scammin' mouth shut.

10:42.033 --> 10:45.201
Now if you'll excuse me,
barrel roll!

10:45.203 --> 10:47.294
- I'm not scammin'!
[grunts]

10:47.372 --> 10:50.631
I'm delaying the truth!

10:50.633 --> 10:52.150
- Ah, hola, Bex!

10:52.301 --> 10:55.545
- Wait, if you're here,
what happens to the chopper?

10:55.563 --> 10:56.446
- I don't know.

10:58.808 --> 11:00.825
- Oh, I see. Cool.

11:00.902 --> 11:02.160
[all grunt]

11:02.237 --> 11:03.828
- And superhero landing!

11:03.905 --> 11:06.331
- [grunting]

11:11.838 --> 11:12.987
- I'm back, Mom.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.840
- Hi, Dennis.
- Slayer, Mom! Come on.

11:15.917 --> 11:18.251
- Sorry, pookums.
- Ugh.

11:18.327 --> 11:20.161
Come on,
I'll show you my gaming studio.

11:20.238 --> 11:21.996
It's soundproof, waterproof,
and fartproof.

11:22.073 --> 11:24.307
- Oh, we'll see about that.

11:28.522 --> 11:29.979
[all gasp]

11:31.358 --> 11:33.692
- Welcome back, Slayer.
Energy drink?

11:33.768 --> 11:35.101
- Whoa! A robot servant?

11:35.253 --> 11:37.603
- Actually, it's just
a hologram of a robot servant.

11:37.756 --> 11:40.089
See?
all: Ooh!

11:40.091 --> 11:41.274
- See, this is how you know

11:41.350 --> 11:43.609
you're making
just the right amount of money.

11:43.762 --> 11:46.353
- Who's a ticklish hologram?

11:46.431 --> 11:48.540
- Ow. Those are my genitals.

11:49.935 --> 11:51.601
- Ugh! This place is so cool!

11:51.603 --> 11:55.196
- Not as cool as the ten grand
you donated to Operation Wag.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.365
- Yeah, about that, uh,
there's something I need to--

11:58.385 --> 12:01.794
- Boom! Slayer swag.
Take what you want, guys!

12:01.871 --> 12:03.722
- First dibs!
It was my ten grand.

12:03.873 --> 12:05.965
- I got a gaming
hemorrhoid pillow!

12:06.117 --> 12:08.968
- I got a PlayStation 10!
- I got a Slayer hat.

12:09.045 --> 12:10.303
[all groan]
[Wolf sniffs]

12:10.455 --> 12:11.563
And it smells like his head.

12:11.714 --> 12:12.972
- Gimme! See, Mia?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.958
You do something good
and good things happen.

12:14.976 --> 12:16.735
- Duncan, this is dope as hell,

12:16.886 --> 12:18.403
but you didn't
do anything good.

12:18.554 --> 12:19.553
You cheated a charity!

12:19.631 --> 12:21.314
Just get the keyboard
and get out.

12:21.390 --> 12:23.575
But to reiterate,
this is dope as hell.

12:23.802 --> 12:25.243
Look at all the Rollies I got!

12:25.394 --> 12:26.411
- Ugh, you're right.

12:26.596 --> 12:29.138
- Slayer, it's really been cool
coming here,

12:29.140 --> 12:30.415
jumping out of a chopper,

12:30.566 --> 12:33.901
and fondling your hologram
robot, but we gotta bounce.

12:33.979 --> 12:35.812
So if you could just give us
your keyboard...

12:35.830 --> 12:38.739
- I am absolutely going to
give you that keyboard.

12:38.817 --> 12:39.816
- Hmm?

12:39.818 --> 12:41.593
- When I present it to you

12:41.744 --> 12:45.671
as a part of my
livestream charity event!

12:45.748 --> 12:46.990
[all gasp]

12:46.992 --> 12:48.933
all:
Huh?

12:49.160 --> 12:51.418
[cheers and applause]

12:51.438 --> 12:54.255
- I want the world to meet
the generous donors

12:54.274 --> 12:57.016
that are gonna make it possible
for these little guys

12:57.168 --> 13:00.094
to one day
raise their tails in pride.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.355
<i> [cheers and applause]</i>

13:02.431 --> 13:06.326
- Wow, Duncan,
you played yourself this time.

13:08.363 --> 13:12.031
- So I spent the whole weekend
in jail, and you didn't?

13:12.183 --> 13:13.941
- Jack, you have to understand.

13:14.019 --> 13:15.442
I've always wanted to tell you,

13:15.462 --> 13:18.779
but I haven't been able to
because I haven't wanted to.

13:18.857 --> 13:21.633
- Continue talking, lady.
- Okay, okay.

13:21.784 --> 13:25.211
It all started the night
those mugshots were taken.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.696
- We know.

13:26.698 --> 13:27.713
- Tipper Bore?!

13:27.790 --> 13:28.881
When I drive past Sam Goody,

13:29.034 --> 13:30.809
how am I supposed to explain
that to my kids?

13:30.960 --> 13:32.218
- Trash talking the first lady?

13:32.295 --> 13:35.814
Yeah, I could understand,
but the second lady?

13:35.965 --> 13:37.723
- Please, I can't go to jail!

13:37.876 --> 13:39.375
I have a dream of someday

13:39.394 --> 13:41.653
working at a very low level
of law enforcement!

13:41.729 --> 13:43.988
- Then pin this on your
hothead hippie boyfriend,

13:44.140 --> 13:45.048
and you're free
to walk out of here.

13:45.050 --> 13:46.382
- Never.

13:46.551 --> 13:49.235
- You really wanna give up
your future for some loser?

13:49.312 --> 13:52.646
- Sorry, pigs!
She doesn't speak oink!

13:52.666 --> 13:54.724
[laughing]

13:54.726 --> 13:58.127
- So, again, who sullied
Tipper Gore's name?

13:59.655 --> 14:01.564
- Oink! Oink!

14:01.583 --> 14:03.091
- [sighs]

14:04.402 --> 14:06.219
[panting]

14:07.496 --> 14:10.515
- Annie, how could you!?
- I'm so sorry, Jack.

14:10.666 --> 14:13.500
- Sorry?! You sold me out!

14:13.578 --> 14:16.245
[sobbing]

14:16.264 --> 14:18.022
- Mommy's a snitch.

14:19.267 --> 14:22.085
- So in honor of your
incredible generosity,

14:22.087 --> 14:23.969
here is my personal keyboard.

14:24.047 --> 14:26.105
And yes, it smells
like my hands.

14:26.182 --> 14:27.532
- I knew it.
- Okay, we gotta go.

14:27.683 --> 14:30.109
Uh, can we take
any helicopter, or...?

14:30.261 --> 14:32.428
- Hang on,
it looks like Banjo's

14:32.521 --> 14:33.763
got a little thank you note!

14:33.765 --> 14:35.114
all:
Aww.

14:35.266 --> 14:38.126
- See, Mavis?
That dog appreciates his life.

14:39.287 --> 14:42.271
- Fray-yood?
- It's "fraud."

14:42.290 --> 14:44.048
- That's right--I know
you don't have the money.

14:44.275 --> 14:45.532
Your card was declined.

14:45.610 --> 14:47.868
It's only authorized
for bully-related expenses.

14:47.946 --> 14:49.203
- Oh, my God!
You knew the whole time?

14:49.280 --> 14:50.371
I'm so sorry.

14:50.615 --> 14:52.724
- You lied to me,
and on the Internet, no less.

14:52.875 --> 14:55.560
all:
Ooh!

14:55.711 --> 14:57.303
- Duncan, is this true?

14:57.455 --> 14:58.955
- Cheating me is one thing,

14:58.973 --> 15:00.957
but cheating dogs
with limp tails?

15:00.975 --> 15:01.882
What kind of psychopath
does that?

15:01.902 --> 15:03.884
- You think you know a guy.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.144
- There can only be
one punishment.

15:05.296 --> 15:07.313
- A warning?
- One giant island.

15:07.465 --> 15:10.149
All weapons unlocked.
Last man standing wins.

15:10.301 --> 15:13.578
- Uh, what?
- I'm gonna hunt your ass.

15:13.729 --> 15:14.654
Oh, and kill you.

15:14.806 --> 15:15.997
- [gasps]

15:18.567 --> 15:20.143
A Kaboom Bow?

15:20.145 --> 15:22.253
- The splash damage
on that thing is epic!

15:22.330 --> 15:24.830
Ah, which is not good for us.
Right.

15:24.983 --> 15:27.500

Three, two, one!

15:27.576 --> 15:31.003

[all yelling]

15:41.441 --> 15:42.665
- This is crazy.

15:42.684 --> 15:44.442
Do you think Slayer
really wants to kill us?

15:44.593 --> 15:45.851
- You figure it out.

15:45.928 --> 15:48.595
Joker hair, island compound,
his name is Slayer!

15:48.615 --> 15:52.283
- And his hair,
it's like the Joker's!

15:52.435 --> 15:55.161
Aw, I'm sorry, is that
what you were just saying?

15:56.790 --> 15:58.181
- Can't we work this out?

15:58.199 --> 15:59.865
I don't know, I could do, like,
a payment plan

15:59.942 --> 16:01.275
or mow your island.

16:01.352 --> 16:02.293
- I could tutor you!

16:02.445 --> 16:04.111
Video games
aren't gonna last forever.

16:04.205 --> 16:05.630
Don't you wanna be a success?

16:05.707 --> 16:06.798
- Are you kidding?

16:06.949 --> 16:08.949
My thumbs are insured
for two mil each!

16:08.969 --> 16:10.617
Aren't you? Yes, you are.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.803
- I've wasted my life.

16:12.030 --> 16:14.213
- That's it. Weapon time.

16:14.365 --> 16:15.214
Ooh.

16:15.366 --> 16:16.215
Mm.

16:16.367 --> 16:17.308
Ah!

16:17.460 --> 16:18.884
Mom!

16:18.961 --> 16:21.646
- I don't know if this changes
your mind, but my biggest fear?

16:21.873 --> 16:23.130
Being hit by a lunch bag.

16:23.132 --> 16:24.315
- Headshot!

16:24.467 --> 16:25.558
[all yell]

16:25.634 --> 16:27.801
[all panting]

16:27.821 --> 16:31.047
- [grunting]

16:31.065 --> 16:33.049
- I can't believe
you flipped on Dad to the cops

16:33.067 --> 16:34.158
and then he went
to the sporting goods store,

16:34.310 --> 16:35.901
bought a heavy bag,
came home, set it up,

16:36.054 --> 16:37.386
and now he's trying
to punch the hurt away.

16:37.480 --> 16:39.055
- I know it seems
like I did wrong,

16:39.073 --> 16:41.165
but because
I turned in your Dad,

16:41.242 --> 16:43.668
I was able to pursue
my dream job

16:43.819 --> 16:47.063
that provides so many
great things for this family,

16:47.156 --> 16:48.748
like our limited HMO.

16:48.900 --> 16:51.250
You kids love that limited HMO.

16:51.327 --> 16:53.494
- But my Stanley
the Stinkless Skunk book

16:53.571 --> 16:56.014
says that you always stand
by the person you love--

16:56.165 --> 16:58.758
even if it stinks for you.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.000
- Let me see that.

17:00.078 --> 17:02.411
[muttering indistinctly]

17:02.430 --> 17:03.354
Crap.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.084
- I can't believe I'm gonna die

17:08.086 --> 17:10.361
just because
I love flavored caffeine!

17:10.438 --> 17:12.772
- Bet you guys wish
you were Christian now.

17:12.924 --> 17:17.518
Almighty Lord, my savior,
beam my butt outta here.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.494
[grunts]

17:19.781 --> 17:21.614
Aw, come on, dude!

17:21.690 --> 17:23.099
- We're not gonna die!

17:23.192 --> 17:24.950
Nobody knows
video games like us.

17:25.027 --> 17:26.360
- Yeah, we've been
wasting our lives

17:26.379 --> 17:28.120
for a situation just like this.

17:28.197 --> 17:30.531
- All we gotta do is run-jump.
Run-jump.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.865
Run-jump. Run-jump.

17:31.943 --> 17:33.700
Ugh, forget it, we're dead.
- No!

17:33.795 --> 17:36.946
Video games always have
supplies hidden somewhere.

17:36.964 --> 17:39.448
Look under every rock,
bush and crate!

17:39.467 --> 17:41.634
- There's gotta be ammo
and rations underneath--

17:41.786 --> 17:43.352
[yelps]
- [yelps]

17:45.065 --> 17:47.214
- Oh, my God,
our friends are gone!

17:47.233 --> 17:49.383
- Yeah, we're alone
on this island.
