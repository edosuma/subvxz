WEBVTT

00:07.840 --> 00:09.570
Okay, everybody, gather round.

00:09.710 --> 00:13.740
Time for the semiannual
new-sandwich-idea meeting.

00:14.780 --> 00:16.309
Okay. Max, go.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.780
The Crust Lover's Special.

00:17.920 --> 00:21.080
lt's a sandwich
made out of only bread crusts.

00:21.620 --> 00:22.920
What do you do with the middles?

00:23.760 --> 00:27.750
lt would be nice if you pitched ideas
rather than problems once in a while.

00:31.700 --> 00:33.190
Okay.

00:33.340 --> 00:37.170
- Alex, go.
- Okay. Meat Me in Little ltaly.

00:37.570 --> 00:39.700
Double the meat on a small ltalian roll.

00:39.840 --> 00:44.070
And you could also say
Meat Me in Turkey.

00:44.210 --> 00:47.650
And l think you know
where l'm going with this.

00:49.590 --> 00:53.450
l have created sandwich-naming dice.

00:53.590 --> 00:55.490
One has the name
of New York City locations,

00:55.620 --> 00:58.120
the other, various sandwich meats.

00:58.260 --> 00:59.420
Watch.

01:00.930 --> 01:02.800
Lincoln Tunnel Tuna.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.530
That's the beauty
of the sandwich-naming dice.

01:06.670 --> 01:09.160
lf you don't like it, you just roll again.

01:10.310 --> 01:12.500
Lincoln Tunnel Tuna.

01:14.340 --> 01:15.640
Here, l'll...

01:19.120 --> 01:20.510
Lincoln Tunnel Tuna.

01:22.320 --> 01:24.550
Hey, somebody fixed these dice.

01:25.150 --> 01:27.350
Why are you looking at me?

01:27.490 --> 01:29.720
Yeah, you should look at me.

01:31.860 --> 01:33.830
Wait a minute. l've got an idea.

01:33.960 --> 01:37.730
What if we take double the meat
and put it in a small ltalian roll--

01:37.870 --> 01:40.560
And we can call it
Meat Me in Little ltaly.

01:41.070 --> 01:43.040
What?

01:43.170 --> 01:46.370
Don't you get it, honey? lt's a pun.

01:46.510 --> 01:48.880
lt's not a pun. lt's stolen.

01:49.010 --> 01:50.340
You heard me, right, Justin?

01:50.480 --> 01:52.710
l didn't hear a thing.

01:54.150 --> 01:56.680
Well, Alex, if you say you said it,
you probably did.

01:56.820 --> 01:59.790
The most important thing is,
if one of us has a great idea,

01:59.920 --> 02:02.250
we all have a great idea.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.420
Oh, honey,
l just came up with another one.

02:04.560 --> 02:06.620
Meat Me in Turkey.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.320
Alex, you can take credit for that one.

02:08.460 --> 02:10.800
See? Now everybody's happy.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:03.120 --> 03:04.180
Question.

03:04.320 --> 03:08.190
lf you're faced with a situation
and time is running out, what do you do?

03:08.690 --> 03:11.790
Let one rip
and blame whoever else is in the room.

03:14.100 --> 03:15.860
Okay.

03:16.170 --> 03:17.460
We're talking about magic.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.800
More specifically,
the freeze-frame spell.

03:22.070 --> 03:24.770
You can freeze people around you
without freezing yourself.

03:24.910 --> 03:26.740
lt was developed by Dr. J. Geils.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.000
Justin, why don't you give it a try?

03:29.140 --> 03:32.110
All you have to do is say:

03:32.250 --> 03:33.580
And time will be frozen.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.740
- For how long?
- For as long as you can hop on one leg.

03:36.890 --> 03:38.050
Wait, wait. Why one leg?

03:38.190 --> 03:40.880
Because Dr. J. Geils
only had one leg.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.130
Charley horse. Charley horse.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.900
Going down.

04:07.750 --> 04:11.020
Hey, l like this spell.

04:19.399 --> 04:22.490
All right.
One Meat Me in Little ltaly combo,

04:22.630 --> 04:23.960
or, as l prefer to call it,

04:24.100 --> 04:25.730
My Mom and Dad
Never Give Me Enough Credit

04:25.870 --> 04:28.170
For All the Hard Work l Do sandwich.

04:28.970 --> 04:31.570
Oh, a sandwich with a side of attitude.

04:31.710 --> 04:33.230
Tasty.

04:35.540 --> 04:37.810
- What are those?
- Oh, my gosh, you're relentless.

04:37.950 --> 04:41.540
lf you must know,
l work for a fashion magazine.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.280
Well, not a good one.

04:46.420 --> 04:49.150
All these outfits are trying
way too hard to be different.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.660
Well, you're unusually opinionated.

04:51.790 --> 04:54.320
No, it's pretty usual for me.

04:54.900 --> 04:56.690
l'll tell you what l like.

05:01.570 --> 05:06.630
This with this and that with that.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.180
l like your panache, kid.

05:11.310 --> 05:12.540
Oh, we don't have panache.

05:12.680 --> 05:16.050
But we do have quiche.
lt's kind of like a pie.

05:18.550 --> 05:20.820
Would you be interested
in an internship this summer

05:20.960 --> 05:23.750
with Fashion Fatale Magazine?

05:23.890 --> 05:25.330
Fashion Fatale?

05:25.460 --> 05:28.860
l read those for free at the newsstand
until the guy chases me away.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.300
Just give me one second.
Let me ask my parents.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.270
Mom, Dad,
some dude from Fashion Fatale Magazine

05:36.410 --> 05:38.930
just offered me an internship,
and l'm gonna take it. Okay.

05:41.780 --> 05:42.940
They said yes.

05:52.790 --> 05:54.050
Before we get started,

05:54.190 --> 05:57.490
l'd like to introduce you to our new intern,
Alex Russo.

05:57.630 --> 05:59.390
Air kisses.

06:02.430 --> 06:05.200
Okay. That was really weird.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.000
Kiss back.

06:07.140 --> 06:09.230
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:18.780 --> 06:20.310
Hi, l'm Alex. What's your name?

06:20.450 --> 06:21.780
Paul.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.820
Oh, that's a cool name.
How do you spell it?

06:23.950 --> 06:27.480
P-A-U-L.

06:29.860 --> 06:31.330
lsn't that just Paul?

06:31.460 --> 06:33.260
lt's Paul.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.230
Okay, people.

06:36.370 --> 06:39.060
l'd like those ideas
for the fall-fling issue.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.600
l want different.

06:40.740 --> 06:42.260
What different ideas do you have?

06:42.400 --> 06:45.900
Eve, you're up.
You panicked. We're done with you.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.840
Jack, you're up.

06:48.310 --> 06:50.780
Wearable yogurt.

06:51.780 --> 06:53.810
You have got to stop pitching that.

06:57.420 --> 06:58.850
l have an idea.

06:58.990 --> 07:02.790
No, you don't.
lnterns don't pitch ideas, they get coffee.

07:02.930 --> 07:05.450
Sure, Alex, what you got?

07:07.130 --> 07:10.390
Well, something different would be

07:10.530 --> 07:13.830
finding a way
to make summer colors work in the fall.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.460
Love it.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.570
Pushing the envelope
without bursting the envelope.

07:18.710 --> 07:20.730
Okay, l need research on it,

07:20.880 --> 07:22.840
l need editorial on it,
l need photography on it.

07:22.980 --> 07:24.780
And, Paul, l need some coffee.

07:24.910 --> 07:26.780
Eight sugars. Dash of cream.

07:27.920 --> 07:31.610
And l'll have a chocolate biscotti, Paul.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.730
Okay. Our new hire, Millie,
will be here any minute,

07:43.870 --> 07:46.840
and l expect the two of you to show her
how things are done around here.

07:46.970 --> 07:48.870
Millie? lsn't that a grandma's name?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.400
What, is it short
for ''millions of years old''?

07:52.910 --> 07:54.470
l bet you she smells like ham.

07:54.610 --> 07:58.550
Hey, maybe then people will smell her,
and we'll sell more ham.

08:00.220 --> 08:02.480
There she is.
Hi, Millie, welcome to the shop.

08:08.760 --> 08:11.990
Well, now we know
what her first job is gonna be.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.330
Hey, Millie. How you doing?

08:15.460 --> 08:18.330
- These are our sons, Justin and Max.
- Hi, guys.

08:21.900 --> 08:25.400
Did l forget to wear pants or something?
Because l have that dream sometimes.

08:25.540 --> 08:28.240
No, no, no.

08:29.410 --> 08:30.810
Hi.

08:31.710 --> 08:34.510
l was two away from all girls.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.610
l'm going to be training you,

08:37.750 --> 08:41.620
so we might be spending
a lot of time together.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.950
Yeah, it's an intensive process.

08:45.130 --> 08:47.060
You don't smell like ham.

08:48.300 --> 08:51.290
Thank you.
l've worked really hard on that.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.900
Hey, you like Tears of Blood?
l love that band.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.230
l never thought a girl
like you would like them.

08:58.370 --> 09:00.070
A girl like what?

09:00.740 --> 09:02.370
Pretty.

09:04.610 --> 09:07.010
l don't smell like ham and l'm pretty?

09:07.150 --> 09:08.550
l like it here.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.050
Hey, Millie,
come over here and l'll show you

09:11.190 --> 09:13.810
where Jerry hides
when l'm looking for him.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.950
lt looks like you should ask Millie out.

09:20.100 --> 09:23.390
You know,
l could be your wingman on this one.

09:23.530 --> 09:26.430
A wingman? What do you know
about being a wingman?

09:26.570 --> 09:29.060
l know plenty.

09:29.570 --> 09:32.130
All right, fine.
Okay, yeah, you're my wingman.

09:33.010 --> 09:36.710
Great. l gotta get some wings
and a hawk mask.

09:39.350 --> 09:41.940
No. Dude, a wingman is someone
who says cool stuff about me

09:42.080 --> 09:44.280
to Millie to get her to go out with me.

09:44.420 --> 09:46.980
You mean cool stuff like:

09:47.490 --> 09:49.790
Pretty.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.870
So this is where it all happens.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.090
Over there is photography,

10:00.240 --> 10:04.170
where they show beautiful girls
so other girls feel inferior.

10:05.210 --> 10:10.240
Over there is editorial, where they write
articles that make girls feel inferior.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.110
What's over there?

10:12.250 --> 10:15.550
Oh, that's the kitchen, where people
are too self-conscious to eat.

10:17.620 --> 10:19.950
lt's just like l imagined it would be.

10:20.090 --> 10:22.820
Lots of cool people
not making eye contact with me.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.120
Watch.

10:25.490 --> 10:27.090
Hi.

10:27.230 --> 10:28.660
See? She didn't even look up.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.360
Alex, this is not show-and-tell time.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.590
Ms. Angela will be here any minute.

10:34.140 --> 10:36.260
Ms. Angela is the publisher
of the magazine.

10:36.410 --> 10:40.140
She's gonna come by to approve my
bringing-summer-colors-into-fall idea.

10:41.310 --> 10:42.800
Jeffrey.

10:42.940 --> 10:45.040
Where are the treats for my doggie?

10:45.180 --> 10:47.810
Ms. Angela, you don't have a dog.

10:47.950 --> 10:49.940
Run down to Petland and get me a dog.

10:50.550 --> 10:52.040
Bye-bye.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.720
Jeffrey, who are these people?

10:58.330 --> 11:00.260
Hi, l'm Alex. l'm the new intern.

11:00.400 --> 11:03.960
No, no, not you. l was talking about the girl
who's dressed like a giant preschooler.

11:08.540 --> 11:10.130
That was rude.

11:10.270 --> 11:14.440
Don't worry, l've rewired my brain
so they come across as compliments.

11:15.380 --> 11:17.210
Thank you.

11:18.550 --> 11:20.340
Jeffrey.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.140
Jeffrey.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.950
Oh, Jeffrey.
l need to see the new issue.

11:39.370 --> 11:40.630
lnteresting.

11:40.770 --> 11:42.860
Summer colors in the fall.

11:44.510 --> 11:45.560
l like it.

11:45.970 --> 11:47.500
l like it a lot.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.700
Great idea, Jeffrey.

11:50.250 --> 11:51.970
You are not fired today.

11:52.110 --> 11:53.580
Thank you, Ms. Angela.

11:53.720 --> 11:56.810
l try to come up
with the best ideas possible for you.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.280
Well, just keep those ideas coming,
Jeffrey. l have big plans for you.

12:02.460 --> 12:06.450
Jeffrey, you totally took credit for my idea.
What was that about?

12:06.600 --> 12:07.890
That's about you being an intern

12:08.030 --> 12:12.590
and me being the next editor-in-chief
of Fashion Fatale Magazine,

12:12.730 --> 12:14.790
l can't believe you stole my idea.

12:14.940 --> 12:17.800
Don't worry, kid.
You'll have your time to shine.

12:17.940 --> 12:20.410
ln the meantime,
how about some coffee?

12:20.540 --> 12:22.340
Oh, no, thanks. l don't drink coffee.

12:22.480 --> 12:25.070
You don't have to drink it to get it.

12:25.210 --> 12:27.880
Everyone, Alex is going on a coffee run.

12:30.690 --> 12:32.080
Can you believe that?

12:32.220 --> 12:34.250
l know. lt's horrible.

12:34.390 --> 12:36.120
l'll have a caramel macchiato.

12:44.330 --> 12:46.320
All right, wingman,
get over there and talk me up.

12:46.470 --> 12:49.490
As soon as you feel she's ready,
you give me the high sign.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.400
Got it.

12:51.910 --> 12:53.900
What's a high sign?

12:57.110 --> 12:59.810
Finish scratching that itch
and show me the high sign.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.810
Just wave hi, okay? Just like this.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.290
- Got it.
- Good.

13:08.460 --> 13:09.520
Hey, Millie.

13:09.660 --> 13:12.720
Did you know that Justin
wears his underwear in the shower?

13:15.460 --> 13:17.860
l thought l was supposed
to give the high sign.

13:18.630 --> 13:21.400
This does not make it private.

13:22.270 --> 13:23.740
l think it does.

13:24.210 --> 13:26.200
No, it doesn't.

13:27.780 --> 13:30.140
Well, here's something
that's cool for sure.

13:30.280 --> 13:31.680
He has a lot of comic books.

13:32.450 --> 13:34.850
- That's cool.
- But wait, there's more.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.510
He has action figures
of the heroes in the comic books,

13:37.650 --> 13:40.520
and he uses them to act out the scenes.

13:44.460 --> 13:45.520
She's ready.

13:53.540 --> 13:55.000
The idea was all mine.

13:55.140 --> 13:57.760
And Jeffrey made Ms. Angela
think it was all his idea.

13:57.910 --> 13:59.460
And then he made you get coffee.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.840
By the way,
mine was cold when you brought it back.

14:04.810 --> 14:07.480
You know,
since Jeffrey steals my good ideas,

14:07.620 --> 14:10.550
l should just give him a bad idea
and watch him take credit for that.

14:10.690 --> 14:12.650
Well, Ms. Angela hates my clothes.

14:12.790 --> 14:14.310
Give him an idea with those in it.

14:14.460 --> 14:15.550
Right.

14:15.690 --> 14:17.780
Even though you love my clothes.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.250
Right.

14:19.390 --> 14:21.790
So how many outfits do you think
you can make in a day?

14:21.930 --> 14:23.760
Let's say 20.

14:23.900 --> 14:28.100
l'd say 40, but my dad's using my
sewing machine to make a new saddle.

14:28.770 --> 14:31.140
Right.

14:37.980 --> 14:39.500
Who is it?

14:43.820 --> 14:46.050
lt's me, Alex.

14:46.190 --> 14:47.250
Oh, l didn't see you.

14:47.390 --> 14:49.860
My door's closed. Come on in.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.550
What have you got?

14:55.160 --> 14:57.360
l have another idea l wanna give you.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.590
Fashion for people
who are not into fashion.

15:00.970 --> 15:04.630
lsn't that just any clothing store
with the word ''barn'' in the name?

15:05.940 --> 15:10.110
No, it's for those people who are after
a totally, completely unique look.

15:10.250 --> 15:11.870
A look so outrageous

15:12.010 --> 15:16.470
that only people who have rewired their
brain could feel good about wearing it.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.510
Tasty. Why don't you get me
some sketches?

15:20.660 --> 15:21.850
l can do even better.

15:21.990 --> 15:25.590
By this time tomorrow,
l could organize a fashion show right here.

15:25.730 --> 15:28.630
Fashion show. Extra tasty.

15:28.760 --> 15:34.170
And you know, l could get Ms. Angela
to come and almost be interested.

15:35.570 --> 15:38.000
Well, aren't you just full of good ideas?

15:38.140 --> 15:40.160
We are bursting with flavor.

15:46.150 --> 15:47.480
You shouldn't be embarrassed.

15:47.620 --> 15:51.380
l'm sure a lot of guys in gym class
shower in their underwear.

15:52.250 --> 15:54.240
No. l'm the only one.

15:56.660 --> 15:59.350
There are some times
when you should lie.

15:59.490 --> 16:02.900
To me and everyone.
And this is one of those times.

16:04.170 --> 16:06.730
Oh, my gosh, there she is. Hide me.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.000
Justin.

16:11.140 --> 16:14.130
Justin. Oh, Justin.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.210
There you are.

16:19.580 --> 16:20.910
Nice hiding place.

16:22.850 --> 16:25.620
You know, your brother said
some cool stuff about you the other day.

16:26.090 --> 16:27.750
He makes a lot of that stuff up.

16:27.890 --> 16:30.450
You mean like playing
with action figures and stuff?

16:30.590 --> 16:32.650
Because l thought
that was really awesome.

16:33.260 --> 16:37.600
Oh, that.
Well, that's the cold, hard truth.

16:39.670 --> 16:40.930
Good.

16:41.070 --> 16:43.440
So l was wondering,
are you busy Friday night?

16:44.170 --> 16:45.230
Me?

16:45.370 --> 16:47.470
Friday?

16:47.610 --> 16:49.170
What's up?

16:50.410 --> 16:53.470
Well, l have two tickets
to Tears of Blood, and l was thinking--

16:53.620 --> 16:55.110
Say no more. l'm in.

16:55.250 --> 16:56.310
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:56.450 --> 16:57.510
Okay, great.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.240
So be at my house at 7:30.

17:06.430 --> 17:07.900
l'm going out with Millie on Friday.

17:08.030 --> 17:11.290
How's that for a guy who showers
in his underwear? You might wanna try it.

17:22.040 --> 17:26.000
Harper, thank you for creating
the most horrible clothes l've ever seen.

17:26.150 --> 17:28.210
You're welcome.
What are best friends for?

17:28.950 --> 17:30.420
Oh, are you going on the runway too?

17:32.250 --> 17:33.310
No.

17:34.890 --> 17:36.580
l know.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.220
No, no, no.
Don't wanna ruin the surprise.

17:43.360 --> 17:46.530
Everyone is very excited
about the presentation. And so am l.

17:46.670 --> 17:50.400
Well, people are gonna be talking
about this for quite some time.

17:50.540 --> 17:51.660
Jeffrey, can we get started?

17:51.810 --> 17:54.640
l'm so excited
to see all of your great ideas.

17:54.780 --> 17:57.940
You know, Ms. Angela, about that.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.270
l was reading my horoscope,

17:59.410 --> 18:01.940
and it's very important
that l do one good thing today.

18:02.350 --> 18:04.340
l'm giving credit where credit is due.

18:04.490 --> 18:08.920
And what you're about to see
is entirely our intern, Alex Russo's, idea.

18:09.060 --> 18:10.490
What? Now you give me credit?

18:10.630 --> 18:14.490
That's not the plan.
Ms. Angela, we're all a big team here.

18:14.630 --> 18:15.990
ldeas bounce around,

18:16.130 --> 18:18.830
and which one lands in whose head,
you never do know.

18:18.970 --> 18:20.260
This one is all Jeffrey's.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.460
Alex, stop.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.470
You were right
when you talked to me earlier.

18:23.610 --> 18:28.170
That plus my horoscope
equals this is Alex's idea, 100 percent.

18:28.310 --> 18:30.330
Would somebody please
show me something?

18:30.480 --> 18:32.240
Oh, this will be something, all right.

18:32.380 --> 18:34.850
Just give me one minute, please.

18:36.850 --> 18:39.620
Harper, change of plans.
We need to change the models.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.980
Jeffrey decided to give me credit
for this whole thing.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.720
Wait, that's good then.
lsn't that what you wanted all along?

18:44.860 --> 18:47.520
Yes, but l wanna take credit
for something Ms. Angela would like.

18:47.930 --> 18:51.520
- Oh, she's gonna hate these.
- l know.

18:51.670 --> 18:56.400
And now,
something that was Alex Russo's idea.

18:57.640 --> 19:01.300
Wait, no. This can't happen. l have
to do something to make you look good.

19:01.440 --> 19:04.430
What do you mean?
l just got the whites of my eyes whitened.

19:04.580 --> 19:06.600
l can't...

19:16.520 --> 19:19.960
How can anybody think
with that junk on?

19:20.090 --> 19:22.190
Oh, l hope l have enough time
to do this.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.460
Wait.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.070
l have all the time in the world.
lt's frozen.

19:50.330 --> 19:51.380
Okay.

19:51.530 --> 19:52.930
Oh, Charley horse. Charley horse.

19:53.060 --> 19:55.530
Go, go, go, work it.
Come on now, ladies. Work it.

19:55.660 --> 19:56.960
Hey, where's your big pineapple?

19:57.100 --> 19:58.330
And she was a butterfly.

19:58.470 --> 19:59.900
Oh, this is all wrong.

20:04.610 --> 20:08.240
l just made bad outfits differently bad.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.140
What is this?

20:16.280 --> 20:18.410
lt looks like they're half-dressed.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.990
Fashion for the non-fashionable.

20:22.120 --> 20:27.390
lt's so unfashionable,
it brings out your under beauty.

20:28.030 --> 20:29.090
Yes.

20:29.230 --> 20:31.990
That's exactly what it does.

20:32.130 --> 20:33.830
l love it.

20:34.600 --> 20:35.830
- You do?
- Well, yes.

20:35.970 --> 20:37.100
Can't you tell?

20:37.240 --> 20:38.800
The way l'm bursting.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.540
Great job, Alex.

20:42.680 --> 20:44.870
l'm going to give you
the highest possible praise.

20:45.010 --> 20:48.640
You are not fired
from your unpaid internship.

20:50.150 --> 20:52.380
Oh, Alex, l have big plans for you.

20:52.520 --> 20:54.950
Actually, l have my own plans.

20:55.090 --> 20:56.780
Harper?

21:00.830 --> 21:02.130
l quit.

21:02.260 --> 21:06.290
And we're gonna go eat.

21:06.730 --> 21:07.890
ln the kitchen.

21:09.170 --> 21:11.430
And we don't care who watches.

21:31.930 --> 21:34.050
Oh, hey, Justin. You're right on time.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.820
Yeah. Tears of Blood
is gonna be awesome.

21:35.960 --> 21:38.760
l bet they're gonna open with
their hit song, ''Crying Blood for You.''

21:38.900 --> 21:41.460
l know. l know.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.070
Oh, am l wearing too much perfume?

21:46.710 --> 21:48.640
No. Perfect.

21:48.780 --> 21:49.940
Perfect amount.

21:50.380 --> 21:52.900
Good. Because my boyfriend says
that l wear too much sometimes.

21:53.580 --> 21:54.840
Boy-who?

21:55.280 --> 21:56.910
Thank you so much for babysitting.

21:57.050 --> 21:59.950
Benji? Come meet Justin.

22:00.090 --> 22:01.320
Baby-what?

22:01.920 --> 22:03.220
Hi, Justin.

22:03.360 --> 22:04.690
This is my cousin, Benji.

22:06.530 --> 22:08.260
Hi, Benji.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.400
Hi, boyfriend.

22:14.270 --> 22:15.570
Okay, we'll be home by 10.

22:17.010 --> 22:19.270
We'll be here.

22:19.970 --> 22:21.840
Hey, did you bring your action figures?

22:22.540 --> 22:23.600
No.

22:23.750 --> 22:25.470
That's okay. l got lots.

22:26.180 --> 22:28.150
- Do you have Aqua Avenger?

Okay. l'll be him.
