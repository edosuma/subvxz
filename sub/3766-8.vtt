WEBVTT

00:09.677 --> 00:11.412
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

00:13.581 --> 00:16.950
-Where am I?
-Grey House.

00:16.984 --> 00:20.020
-I don't understand.
-Brian, we're trying
to help you.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.855
-I need to go.
-Yeah, we're working on it.

00:21.889 --> 00:25.326
-(GROANING) Now...
-No. Not now.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.195
-Honey, honey, lie down.
-(SIGHS)

00:28.529 --> 00:29.763
Where is the ambulance?

00:36.003 --> 00:37.805
(SNORING)

00:39.373 --> 00:40.841
-Martha? What are you doing?
-(GASPS)

00:40.874 --> 00:42.943
Waiting for my briefing.
Waiting for my briefing.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.778
-(CLEARS THROAT)
-You stayed here?

00:44.812 --> 00:49.117
Yes! As commander-in-chief,
I need to be here
to lead my men to victory.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.219
All right, well,
we're not invading a country.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.754
We're just trying to help
these people get through
this winter storm.

00:53.787 --> 00:57.458
And I am on the front lines,
standing shoulder-to-shoulder
with our men in...

00:58.126 --> 00:59.360
-White?
-Blue.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.028
Blue.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.564
I've called all our
volunteer snowplowers,
and we don't have enough.

01:03.597 --> 01:06.033
I mean, not nearly enough.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.735
But you have to
clear the roads.

01:07.768 --> 01:10.538
But I'm clearing these roads
so that our people
can get through,

01:10.571 --> 01:13.607
not so that media can get here
to interview you.

01:13.641 --> 01:16.377
The people of Middleton
are scared, trapped.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.079
Their...
Their roads are impassable!

01:19.113 --> 01:22.015
I need to do what I do best,
which is get
the message out there

01:22.049 --> 01:24.752
that I'm on the job
and that everything
is going to be fine.

01:24.785 --> 01:28.122
And for that to happen,
I need the media here. So...

01:29.323 --> 01:32.126
What can I do?
I'm at your disposal.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.695
You could call
Mayor Blankenship.

01:34.728 --> 01:40.100
Ask him if he can
lend us his plows, his crews.
Uh, we have so few.

01:40.134 --> 01:44.772
Blairsville has so many.
The storm totally missed them.

01:44.805 --> 01:49.810
It's all just sitting there!
I mean, they're waiting
to be called into action.

01:49.843 --> 01:52.313
What can I do?
I'm at your disposal.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.148
(SIGHS)

02:06.760 --> 02:09.497
(SIGHS) I got hold of my mom.

02:10.498 --> 02:11.932
And?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.601
We're just supposed
to stay put.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.237
Should we tell him?

02:16.270 --> 02:19.740
I don't even think he cares
whether we're stuck or not.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.944
I don't think he wants
to go home.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.416
ANTHONY:
It's really coming down.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.385
(SIGHS) It is.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.922
You worried?

02:35.956 --> 02:36.990
Yeah.

02:37.725 --> 02:38.892
Brandon?

02:40.228 --> 02:43.631
I can't shake this feeling
that he's hurt,

02:46.099 --> 02:48.001
and that he's going
to get hurt even more.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.437
How?

02:50.771 --> 02:51.872
I don't know.

02:54.107 --> 02:57.678
Hey, he's a policeman.
He knows how to
take care of himself.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.046
(CHUCKLES)

03:07.087 --> 03:08.322
(SIGHS)

03:08.789 --> 03:10.491
(CLICKING)

03:11.792 --> 03:14.895
ABIGAIL: Lay still. You don't
want to hurt your back more.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.233
I thought you left.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.469
-I wouldn't leave you.
-Why?

03:22.770 --> 03:25.373
Because I told you I wouldn't.
(SIGHS)

03:27.608 --> 03:30.210
The power went out
on the whole block.

03:38.352 --> 03:41.154
-(EXHALES SHARPLY)
It is treacherous out there.
-Oh.

03:41.188 --> 03:43.357
My car slid right down
the driveway into the street.

03:43.391 --> 03:46.760
Still no word from Brandon.
Derek sent him out a while ago
to get the kids.

03:46.794 --> 03:50.498
-The kids?
-Yeah, they're still
at the library, waiting.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.500
So we can't drive Brian
to the hospital?

03:52.533 --> 03:56.870
Well, it's not going to do him
or us any good to get stuck
out there on the road.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.807
-And if we can't get out...
-The ambulance can't get in.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.209
-(GRUNTS)
-What? What's going on?

04:02.242 --> 04:07.080
His blood pressure is low,
really low. He's dizzy,
light-headed, confused...

04:07.114 --> 04:11.585
I think Brian's got
a slow bleed in the abdomen.
I think it's his spleen.

04:11.619 --> 04:15.088
But he would have had to have
some trauma to the spleen
to cause internal bleeding.

04:15.122 --> 04:18.959
-And he hasn't. Has he?
-No, they've been antiquing
and sightseeing.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.328
(SCOFFS) That wouldn't do it.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.330
(SIGHS) But you feel
that's what it is?

04:22.363 --> 04:24.898
Without tests, blood work,
X-rays,

04:24.932 --> 04:27.468
it's not definitive,
it's an educated guess
at best.

04:27.501 --> 04:28.869
No, it's more than that.

04:28.902 --> 04:31.372
I wish it were, but it's not.

04:31.405 --> 04:34.875
You can't feel your way
into deciding if someone
requires surgery.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.844
I'm not saying
you could or should.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.946
What are you saying?

04:38.979 --> 04:43.384
That just like your medical
skills, your instincts have
been honed over the years.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.719
They're there as a tool,
to guide you.

04:47.254 --> 04:51.258
I need a lab,
or go to the hospital.
An ambulance would be nice.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.094
Trust yourself, Sam. I do.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.996
(SIGHS) Well, it goes
without saying

04:56.029 --> 04:57.531
we need to keep
both of them calm.

04:58.466 --> 04:59.567
Us, too.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.088
(WIND HOWLING)

05:25.426 --> 05:27.561
No, thanks, I'm not hungry.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.199
(GROANS)

05:32.232 --> 05:33.266
(SIGHS)

05:36.637 --> 05:37.838
Drink.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.910
I don't need you disabled
and dehydrated.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.211
(COUGHING)

05:46.146 --> 05:48.281
Help's on the way.

05:48.315 --> 05:51.485
(SIGHS) I feel like you're
a better liar than that.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.754
Come on,
put your back into it.

05:57.591 --> 05:58.692
What do we do now?

05:59.092 --> 06:00.761
Um...

06:00.794 --> 06:03.130
Wait for the
fire department to arrive
and hope they're all single?

06:04.498 --> 06:06.266
(GROANING)

06:13.541 --> 06:15.743
-Checking the weather?
-Yeah.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.145
Luckily, it missed us
here in Blairsville,

06:18.178 --> 06:20.380
-but Middleton's being
hammered.
-Mmm-hmm.

06:20.414 --> 06:21.915
I'd say you're
spending the night.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.852
I've got a hotel room,
but I just want to
get back there.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.421
As soon as the road's clear,
I'm gonna head home.

06:27.455 --> 06:28.822
Girlfriend?

06:30.558 --> 06:33.794
Someday, maybe, yeah.
She's a little gun-shy.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.630
Come off a bad relationship?

06:36.664 --> 06:40.000
No, a perfect marriage.
She's a widow.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.736
-She lives in Middleton?
-Yup.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.205
Owns Bell, Book & Candle.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.507
Cassie Nightingale?

06:47.775 --> 06:49.342
She's renting that building.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.146
She has a long lease.

06:53.180 --> 06:57.050
Uh-huh. You and I know
leases can be broken.

06:57.084 --> 07:00.020
What I know is that
that shop and that building

07:00.053 --> 07:03.123
is a part of her,
and vice versa.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.597
What I'm bringing you
into here,

07:09.630 --> 07:11.899
you're not selling
houses anymore.

07:11.932 --> 07:15.536
It's about packaging an idea.
Dreams, possibilities.

07:17.304 --> 07:22.510
This mall will change the face
and the economic makeup
of Blairsville forever.

07:22.543 --> 07:27.581
There will be no time
for girlfriends or wives
or friends or family,

07:27.615 --> 07:30.618
-and you're gonna
need some help.
-I'm good.

07:30.651 --> 07:34.254
Frankie is better. Best man
in the Chicago office.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.256
Okay, I'll call Frankie.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.527
No need. Frankie's going
to meet you here tonight.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.095
Flew in yesterday
to go over numbers.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.666
And if you can make
Frankie happy,

07:46.366 --> 07:47.868
I'll be happy.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.639
Well, then I better
make Frankie happy.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.550
What's with the Internet?

08:03.884 --> 08:05.986
-It's alive!
-(CHUCKLES)

08:06.019 --> 08:09.356
Seriously, what are we
supposed to do?

08:09.389 --> 08:11.792
Well, we are in a library.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.595
-Read?
-Yeah.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.698
You know, people have been
doing it for centuries.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.567
Because they didn't
have the Internet.

08:19.600 --> 08:23.804
Okay, so Shakespeare wouldn't
have written Romeo and Juliet
if he'd had the Internet?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.773
No, he would have written it,

08:25.806 --> 08:28.776
but everybody would have
waited for it to be made
into a movie

08:28.809 --> 08:33.046
-and then streamed it.
-(SCOFFS) Okay,
so until this storm passes,

08:35.282 --> 08:38.151
it looks like
we're on our own.

08:38.185 --> 08:41.088
-It's going to be okay.
-Are you kidding me?

08:42.155 --> 08:45.325
This is not Lord of the Flies,
it's an ice storm.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.695
I just hope I don't die
of boredom.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.500
And then there were two.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.468
(CHUCKLES)

09:00.774 --> 09:03.076
(INDISTINCT)

09:03.110 --> 09:06.379
-Well?
-We found the cruiser,
but no Brandon.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.015
There's blood
on the door handle

09:08.048 --> 09:10.584
-and tracks leading away
from the vehicle.
-Oh, no!

09:10.618 --> 09:12.552
If he's hurt
and he took off for help,

09:12.586 --> 09:15.222
that means he's disoriented,
he's roaming around
in the cold.

09:15.255 --> 09:18.258
-He could freeze
before we find him.
-We have to find him!

09:18.692 --> 09:19.893
We will.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.330
Right now, we've got
half the people in town

09:23.363 --> 09:26.199
without cell service,
without power, all right?

09:26.233 --> 09:30.503
The roads are practically
impassable. We need to
implement a temporary curfew.

09:30.537 --> 09:32.472
People do not need to be
on the roads tonight.

09:32.505 --> 09:36.209
But number three on my
10-part emergency plan says,
"Make your way to a shelter."

09:36.243 --> 09:40.748
I know, but you haven't
allocated and identified which
buildings to use as shelters.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.483
If we tell people
not to leave their homes
and they have no heat...

09:43.516 --> 09:45.986
If you tell people to go
to shelters that don't exist,

09:46.019 --> 09:49.723
and then they
get stuck in the snow
trying to get there...

09:49.757 --> 09:52.660
-Excuse me.
I have to brief everyone.
-Oh!

09:52.693 --> 09:55.128
Perhaps I should
address the troops.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.097
-Why?
-I'm the Mayor.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.531
I'm the Chief.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.403
Everyone! Guys.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.940
I give you the honorable
Mayor Martha Tinsdale.

10:06.974 --> 10:10.177
Thank you. Officers, staff,

10:10.210 --> 10:12.813
man I don't know
standing in the back
by the water cooler,

10:12.846 --> 10:14.682
lend me your ears.

10:14.715 --> 10:19.219
We have been hit
by a gigantic winter storm
and I am here to...

10:20.387 --> 10:21.421
To...

10:23.090 --> 10:26.159
To introduce
the Chief of Police,
who has an update for you.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.198
All right, guys,
here's the plan.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.707
-I don't understand.
-(SIGHS)

10:39.740 --> 10:42.375
-Did Brian take a fall
yesterday?
-No.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.577
Was he in an accident before
he came to Middleton?

10:44.611 --> 10:48.381
No. What's going on?

10:48.415 --> 10:50.884
I'm getting really worried.
Is Brian going to be okay?

10:50.918 --> 10:54.287
Yes, he is. But we need
to keep an eye on him.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.730
(SIGHS) No cell service.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.265
Ah, me either. Landline?

11:06.099 --> 11:08.468
-Dead.
-The storm.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.704
Yeah, well, Derek knows
we need help.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.973
Yeah, he just doesn't
know that Brian's condition
is getting worse.

11:17.711 --> 11:18.812
(SIGHS)

11:20.047 --> 11:22.549
-All right, what do you got?
-(SIGHS)

11:23.450 --> 11:25.052
-Lip gloss...
-Mmm-hmm.

11:25.085 --> 11:29.923
...toothbrush, uh,
four sticks of gum,
a box of mints and...

11:31.058 --> 11:32.760
-A candy bar.
-(CHUCKLES)

11:32.793 --> 11:33.827
What about you?

11:37.798 --> 11:39.399
Come on, what do you have?

11:40.500 --> 11:43.070
Twenty bucks and an iPod.

11:43.103 --> 11:47.207
-No food?
-No, I stayed with
my dad last night.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.910
And my mom
always does that stuff.

11:49.943 --> 11:52.412
My dad and I, we eat
a lot of bachelor steak.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.848
"Bachelor steak?"

11:54.882 --> 11:57.650
(SIGHS) Yeah, cereal. No milk.

11:57.684 --> 12:00.253
-Yum. (CHUCKLING)
-Hmm.

12:00.287 --> 12:04.557
-Where do you think Nick is?
-(SIGHS) Who knows?

12:04.591 --> 12:07.627
But he'll be back.
When he's hungry.

12:07.660 --> 12:10.063
-He can eat the mints.
-No. We should save the mints.

12:10.430 --> 12:11.531
Gum?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.902
-One stick.
-(LAUGHING)

12:16.136 --> 12:17.237
Here.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.739
(SNAPS)

12:19.773 --> 12:21.308
I'm keeping the bigger piece.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.844
-Of course. As usual.
-(CHUCKLING)

12:30.984 --> 12:32.252
(GROANS)

12:32.552 --> 12:33.821
(COUGHS)

12:35.055 --> 12:36.556
That's good. What is it?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.792
I can't give you
my chef secrets.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.393
(CHUCKLES)

12:43.030 --> 12:45.065
You don't want Sam and I
to be together, do you?

12:47.234 --> 12:49.536
You and Sam are fighting
the natural order of things.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.006
And Cassie and Ryan?

12:53.040 --> 12:57.878
There's a lot of fighting
the natural order of things
around here.

12:57.911 --> 13:00.848
You hired and fired me
because you don't trust me.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.483
Because you want
to control me.

13:03.516 --> 13:06.753
People often want to control
the uncontrollable,

13:06.786 --> 13:07.821
like me.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.523
I trust you.

13:10.557 --> 13:13.493
You didn't even trust me
to move some furniture
or change the menu.

13:14.794 --> 13:15.795
Why is that?

13:18.031 --> 13:19.799
(PANTING)

13:30.310 --> 13:31.845
He's resting.

13:33.613 --> 13:34.915
Sam's with him.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.484
How are you holding up?

13:37.517 --> 13:39.920
(SIGHS) I've had
better vacations.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.991
You make plans and then...

13:44.024 --> 13:46.927
-And then life happens.
-Exactly.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.630
Brian's been under
so much stress at work

13:50.663 --> 13:54.167
that I insisted
we get away from the city,
from everything,

13:55.568 --> 13:56.870
and now look at us.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.872
Lots of stress?

13:58.906 --> 14:00.773
The only relief
he gets is running.

14:03.310 --> 14:07.380
-Brian went running yesterday?
-Hmm. In the afternoon.

14:07.414 --> 14:10.283
He came back early.
It was getting cold already.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.718
Excuse me.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.658
He went running
yesterday afternoon.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.961
It was slick out
even before the storm hit.

14:20.994 --> 14:23.763
-BOTH: He fell.
-But he didn't tell Eve.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.199
Stubborn, manly,
ignored the pain.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.336
I'm familiar with the type.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.038
What are your instincts
telling you?

14:31.071 --> 14:33.240
A small tear. That's why
the bleeding's so slow.

14:33.273 --> 14:36.009
So he fell just hard enough
to hurt his spleen.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.112
Brian needs
emergency surgery.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.826
-(EXHALES) Thanks.
-Yep.

14:53.860 --> 14:56.329
Well, I can start an IV,
get some fluids in him.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.999
That'll buy us
and him some time.

14:59.032 --> 15:02.635
I'm still not used to ordering
supplies myself. Those came
to the house by mistake.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.638
-Oh, lucky mistake.
-Well, we're due
a little good luck.

15:05.672 --> 15:09.542
We just gotta keep him stable
until some help gets here.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.345
-Help is here.
-(CHUCKLES) More help.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.414
What's going on?

15:18.485 --> 15:19.586
(SIGHS)

15:24.791 --> 15:27.227
You look very dashing
in that fire blanket.

15:28.561 --> 15:32.032
You have sprinklers,
so why do you have
a fire blanket?

15:34.334 --> 15:35.969
The sales guy looked like
George Clooney.

15:37.804 --> 15:41.074
Ugh, it is so cold in here!

15:41.108 --> 15:42.275
I know.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.876
We still don't have power.

15:43.910 --> 15:46.913
Which means we don't
have heat. (SIGHS)

15:46.946 --> 15:48.815
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You need to stay awake.

15:48.848 --> 15:50.350
I'm just gonna close my eyes
for a minute.

15:50.383 --> 15:53.186
-No.
-I'm cold and tired.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.722
So am I, but you might
have a concussion.

15:55.755 --> 15:59.459
-I should get back
to the station.
-You're not going anywhere,

15:59.492 --> 16:01.995
and you're not gonna
close your eyes.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.864
(RATTLING)

16:06.766 --> 16:09.636
-Hey!
-Nick!

16:11.638 --> 16:13.240
You're gonna bust me
for this?

16:13.273 --> 16:16.609
-That's public property.
-I'm starved and I don't
have any change.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.011
Well, we have gum.

16:20.713 --> 16:21.781
You missed a spot.

16:23.183 --> 16:26.686
-What?
-Upper right lip. Chocolate.

16:28.121 --> 16:31.624
-I'm guessing you two didn't
have gum for dinner.
-Okay, fine.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.627
-We should've shared.
-I can take care of myself.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.563
-(RATTLING)
-NICK: Oh!

16:39.332 --> 16:41.301
Victory.

16:41.334 --> 16:45.505
I have to say, I would have
expected such selfish
behavior from him.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.275
But you? Grace.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.611
I have to say,
I'm disappointed.

17:02.422 --> 17:05.658
Hey, Cassie, it's me.
It's, like, the fourth time
I've called.

17:05.692 --> 17:09.262
I tried calling Grey House,
but I keep getting
a busy signal.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.998
I hope you're okay.
I'm getting a little worried.

17:12.031 --> 17:16.269
Call me, please.
I'm gonna head home
as soon as it clears.

17:18.071 --> 17:20.173
Okay, bye.

17:22.475 --> 17:25.011
WOMAN: Pardon me,
are you Ryan?

17:25.044 --> 17:26.779
-Yeah.
-I'm Frankie.

17:27.447 --> 17:28.615
Frankie?

17:29.616 --> 17:33.320
Ben sent me. Mr. Jones.
I'm here to help.

17:34.321 --> 17:35.855
You're Jones' best man
in Chicago.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.091
-I am.
-Yeah.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.127
And since we've got
some time, let's go over
some of the figures

17:40.160 --> 17:42.895
from the mall project
that just don't add up.

17:43.530 --> 17:44.697
Uh...

17:45.798 --> 17:47.634
Uh, you've got something
better to do?

17:49.102 --> 17:50.637
It's just that it's late.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.406
Yeah, well,
you need to realize that Ben
doesn't keep regular hours,

17:53.440 --> 17:54.741
and neither do I.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.075
That affects me how?

17:56.876 --> 17:59.045
I'm your new partner on this.

18:01.681 --> 18:02.782
"Partner?"

18:06.853 --> 18:09.656
-(CLICKS)
-(SOFTLY) Oh. Thanks.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.878
(HYPERVENTILATING)

18:33.346 --> 18:34.414
Eve?

18:35.515 --> 18:37.250
I... I can't...
I can't breathe.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.686
Okay, all right, Eve,
we're going to do
some breathing.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.554
(SOBBING) Brian's gonna die.

18:41.588 --> 18:44.591
-No. Sam's not going to let
that happen, are you?
-No.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.058
He's bleeding. He's...

18:46.092 --> 18:48.795
Your baby needs you
to stay calm and breathe.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.663
I don't want
to lose my husband.

18:50.697 --> 18:53.633
Sam's one of the best trauma
surgeons in the country.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.736
He just moved here
and he's taking care of Brian,
okay?

18:56.769 --> 18:59.339
How lucky is that?
Brian's in very good hands.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.509
All right, now take
a deep breath in.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.544
(BREATHING SHAKILY)

19:04.577 --> 19:07.180
You can do better than that.
Come on.

19:07.214 --> 19:09.015
Sam, why don't you
show her how it's done?

19:09.649 --> 19:11.651
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

19:11.684 --> 19:13.753
-Oh, look. See, he's even
worse than you are!
-(BOTH LAUGH)

19:13.786 --> 19:16.923
Okay, all right, come on,
let's do this together, okay?

19:16.956 --> 19:20.026
(BREATHING TOGETHER)

19:28.768 --> 19:31.471
Yes, thank you.
Please keep me informed.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.307
How's the situation
at Grey House?

19:34.341 --> 19:36.142
Still can't get them
on the phone,

19:36.175 --> 19:39.178
but we've got every plow
working to get through.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.080
There was an accident
on the interstate,

19:41.113 --> 19:45.318
so now all the Blairsville
snowplow drivers have to take
back roads to get to us.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.520
It's taking a while.

19:47.554 --> 19:50.457
But thank you for calling
the mayor of Blairsville.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.493
Well, at least I didn't
have to see Darryl
and his smug face

19:53.526 --> 19:57.063
-when I asked for his help.
-How does that guy keep
getting re-elected?

19:57.096 --> 19:59.031
-I...
-(PHONE RINGING)

19:59.065 --> 20:02.335
Mayor Tinsdale. Darryl!

20:02.369 --> 20:06.506
I stand corrected.
Mayor Blankenship.
My apologies.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.008
Yes. Yes.

20:11.278 --> 20:14.881
No, I... Oh, yes, I know,
it was very...

20:14.914 --> 20:17.850
Well, I wouldn't call it
"heroic," exactly.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.820
Yes, I know that Blairsville
is the fifth largest city
in the state,

20:20.853 --> 20:22.722
but thank you
for reminding me yet again.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.091
(CLICKS)

20:25.124 --> 20:28.895
Looks like we're having
phone trouble
at City Hall, too.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.129
What if he calls back?

20:30.162 --> 20:33.566
Ah, I feel like his line
may be dropped all night.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.802
Another casualty of the storm.

20:36.836 --> 20:37.870
(CHUCKLES)

20:40.139 --> 20:43.175
-Eve, I'm cold.
-I'm here. I'm here.

20:43.710 --> 20:44.811
Here.

20:55.087 --> 20:58.991
(SOFTLY) He's getting worse.
I can't just stand here and
watch him bleed to death.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.460
Sam!

21:00.493 --> 21:04.531
For him to have
any chance at all,
I have to stop the bleeding.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.866
And we need to get
Eve's consent.

21:09.702 --> 21:14.106
No. Absolutely not.
How can you do surgery here?

21:14.140 --> 21:17.610
I don't want to,
but if I can just get in there
and clamp off the leak,

21:17.644 --> 21:19.579
-stop the bleeding...
-I don't want you to.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.315
-Eve...
-No.

21:22.349 --> 21:25.117
You are not operating
on my husband here.

21:26.052 --> 21:28.087
An ambulance will arrive.

21:51.611 --> 21:53.946
-Boy, I'm stuffed.
-(SCOFFS)

21:53.980 --> 21:58.451
Chips, cookies,
two candy bars,
and I'm on my third soda.

22:01.888 --> 22:04.424
You guys look hungry.
How's the gum?

22:04.457 --> 22:06.225
-Great.
-Not very filling.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.262
-I'm not going to beg.
-(SIGHS)

22:14.734 --> 22:16.936
-(CRUNCHING)
-(SNIFFS)

22:16.969 --> 22:20.072
So crunchy, so salty...

22:21.508 --> 22:23.342
So good.

22:25.111 --> 22:27.246
Okay, fine, I'll beg.
Please!

22:27.279 --> 22:29.782
-(SIGHS)
-How much you got?

22:31.083 --> 22:34.921
-What?
-Money. Cash.
Coins will also be accepted.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.189
(SCOFFS)

22:37.223 --> 22:40.259
You're seriously going
to take money from us?

22:40.292 --> 22:43.830
Yeah. I was wrong,
this is Lord of the Flies.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.999
See, I do read.
Pay up or starve.

22:47.033 --> 22:50.670
-It's not worth it, Grace.
-(WHISPERING)
There's chocolate.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.040
-Can you break a 20?
-Yup.

22:58.511 --> 22:59.779
(SIGHS)

23:02.449 --> 23:05.518
Where's my change?
You said you could break a 20.

23:06.285 --> 23:08.455
I can, but I'm not going to.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.921
I'm not gonna change my mind.

23:42.889 --> 23:44.123
I know.

23:47.193 --> 23:50.930
What would you do
if it was your husband
lying here?

23:52.932 --> 23:54.166
I trust Sam.

23:54.967 --> 23:57.103
-With your life?
-Absolutely.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.673
With my husband's life?

24:01.040 --> 24:02.141
Yes.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.885
BRANDON: Well, in her defense,
you told her to keep me awake.

24:12.919 --> 24:15.655
You never mentioned
keeping herself awake.

24:15.688 --> 24:16.956
(CHUCKLES)

24:18.157 --> 24:20.292
-You look better.
-Thanks.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.864
-And worse.
-Excuse me?

24:26.232 --> 24:27.967
Something's weighing
heavily on you.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.604
I hate being stuck in here
when I know I'm needed
out there.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.473
That's not what's really
got you worried.

24:36.843 --> 24:37.977
How's your wife?

24:39.245 --> 24:41.080
Tara.

24:41.113 --> 24:42.882
She's away
working on her PhD, right?

24:45.652 --> 24:46.853
Tara?

24:54.426 --> 24:56.763
So, I've got
back-to-back appointments
with local retailers

24:56.796 --> 24:58.665
who are very interested
in space in the mall.

24:58.698 --> 25:02.635
-Great. Let me vet them.
-I've already made
the appointments.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.904
-But I need to approve them.
-Says who?

25:05.371 --> 25:06.472
Ben.

25:08.307 --> 25:10.342
Frankie, I didn't
ask for help.

25:10.376 --> 25:13.012
No, I was sent here
by your boss.

25:13.045 --> 25:16.816
-My partner.
-I think he'd disagree
with that.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.851
The way that I like to work
with all my clients

25:18.885 --> 25:22.054
is that I respectfully steer
them in the right direction.

25:22.088 --> 25:26.726
Hmm. Ben doesn't like to be
steered, and neither do I.

25:26.759 --> 25:27.960
He'll never know.

25:28.795 --> 25:30.830
-I'll tell him.
-Why?

25:30.863 --> 25:33.633
Because when it comes
to business,
I tell my father everything.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.835
Your father?

25:38.270 --> 25:39.438
(SCOFFS)

25:41.674 --> 25:42.875
(CLANGS)

25:44.777 --> 25:46.512
-It's still coming down.
-Yeah.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.748
Thank you, Captain Obvious.

25:49.749 --> 25:50.783
What's wrong?

25:52.585 --> 25:55.487
I'm stuck in a library with
you two and no Internet.

25:55.521 --> 25:57.624
No, it's something else.

25:58.925 --> 26:00.760
It's not.

26:00.793 --> 26:03.095
You were in a much better mood
a couple of days ago.

26:03.129 --> 26:05.364
-How could you tell?
-Anthony!

26:07.233 --> 26:08.500
So what happened?

26:10.436 --> 26:12.104
-Nothing.
-You're lying.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.507
Well... You're just...

26:18.745 --> 26:19.812
Your mom.

26:21.413 --> 26:26.619
I heard that she was coming.
But she's not, is she?

26:26.653 --> 26:30.923
And that's why you don't seem
to care if you're going home.

26:30.957 --> 26:33.259
-Man, that stinks.
-I'm not you.

26:35.061 --> 26:36.195
I'm just trying...

26:36.228 --> 26:38.430
Just leave me alone, okay?

26:46.538 --> 26:47.573
Ooh, it's cold!

26:51.377 --> 26:55.114
-Hello? Come in? Anyone?
-(DOOR OPENS)

-MARTHA: Hi, honey.

26:57.183 --> 27:00.052
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to walk
from our home to here?

27:00.086 --> 27:01.320
It's practically a whiteout.

27:01.353 --> 27:04.123
Well, Sam did say
you need to do more cardio.

27:04.156 --> 27:07.860
I don't think he meant
in a blizzard.
Why am I here?

27:08.527 --> 27:09.696
I need you, Tom.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.098
For the photo op?

27:12.131 --> 27:16.002
No, no. I need you.
Here, with me.

27:16.035 --> 27:20.206
-You're nervous?
-It's the first big test
of my leadership abilities.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.573
And you're doing great.

27:21.607 --> 27:23.876
Oh, you have to say that
because you're married to me.

27:23.910 --> 27:26.846
I'm saying it
because it's true.

27:26.879 --> 27:31.417
You are a born leader
and this town is lucky
to have you at the helm.

27:33.352 --> 27:34.553
Oh...

27:36.455 --> 27:38.290
-Follow me.
-Where are we going?

27:38.324 --> 27:41.694
To the lost-and-found.
And let's hope somebody
lost a suit, preferably blue.

27:41.728 --> 27:44.897
-Why?
-Because eventually
the cameras will be here

27:44.931 --> 27:48.034
and I need you looking
like the man I married,

27:48.067 --> 27:50.402
not the man I passed
hitch-hiking on
the interstate.

28:08.454 --> 28:11.858
(SNIFFLES)
Is there any other way?

28:11.891 --> 28:16.562
Yes. An ambulance
gets him to the hospital
and we do the surgery there,

28:16.595 --> 28:19.398
but I'm afraid he's losing
too much blood.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.804
I don't want him to die.

28:24.837 --> 28:28.474
If we wait much longer,
there's a point of no return
for the body.

28:33.579 --> 28:34.814

I don't know
what I'm going to find
when I open him up.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.194
Hopefully I can cap off
the bleeder with a clamp

28:48.227 --> 28:51.163
and they somehow
get an ambulance here
and get him to the hospital.

28:51.197 --> 28:54.400
It'll buy him some time,
but not a lot.

he'll be in recovery.

31:51.510 --> 31:52.979

No, once I got in there,
I was able to run some tests.

Turns out it was
hemolytic anemia.

of the red blood cells.
It causes the spleen to bleed.

where you can do this work
that you obviously love?

40:00.298 --> 40:02.768
Well, I'm a single dad.

40:02.801 --> 40:06.237
In New York, I had
housekeepers and doormen,

40:07.405 --> 40:10.141
and it was just time
to put my son first.

40:12.544 --> 40:14.780
Running an ER,
working in a hospital,

40:14.813 --> 40:17.483
it's not exactly
family-friendly...

40:17.516 --> 40:20.218
Not Nick-friendly.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.589
Something had to give.
Turns out that something
was me.

40:26.492 --> 40:29.260
-Tea?
-I thought you'd never ask.

40:29.294 --> 40:31.630
-(BOTH CHUCKLE)
-CASSIE: Thanks.

40:37.302 --> 40:38.436
Sir...

40:42.541 --> 40:46.077
The door was open,
but no one was here.

40:49.515 --> 40:53.051
I'm late, but I'm hoping that
my reservation is still good.

40:54.686 --> 40:55.921
This is Grey House?

40:56.888 --> 40:58.256
Linda.

40:58.289 --> 40:59.491
Linda Wallace.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.493
My ex-wife.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.062
Hello, Sam.
