00:05.300 --> 00:08.730
My government will assist
you in any way you wish.

00:08.780 --> 00:12.330
Mr Segundus has it in mind to
establish a school for magicians.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.610
I think this will suit
our purpose nicely.

00:14.660 --> 00:16.329
You of all people should know that

00:16.379 --> 00:18.970
Gilbert Norrell does not look
favourably on other magicians.

00:19.020 --> 00:22.220
But you are his equal, Mr
Strange. You are his equal.

00:24.700 --> 00:27.690
Look at what one magician
has been able to accomplish.

00:27.740 --> 00:30.420
Only consider what two might do.

00:32.020 --> 00:34.730
No, I must NOT go to sleep.

00:34.780 --> 00:36.650
The doctors found nothing?

00:36.700 --> 00:39.440
I'm sorry. Magic cannot cure madness.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.090
'Send him to Portugal?'

00:42.140 --> 00:44.170
I'm astonished you would
suggest such a thing.

00:44.220 --> 00:46.930
Every man must be prepared to
make sacrifices for his country

00:46.980 --> 00:47.970
in time of war.

00:48.020 --> 00:50.650
Jonathan, when I saw Lady Pole
at Harley Street, I promised her

00:50.700 --> 00:52.130
that I should tell you something.

00:52.180 --> 00:54.210
~ What is it?
~ She told me that...

00:54.260 --> 00:56.810
He awoke to find the carpet covered
in legions of tiny people

00:56.860 --> 00:58.330
about two inches high.

00:58.380 --> 00:59.730
They rode white polecats.

00:59.780 --> 01:01.730
Lady Pole is not in her wits.

01:01.780 --> 01:03.770
She hates Mr Norrell, Jonathan.

01:03.820 --> 01:07.010
Mr Strange should know what kind
of a man he is dealing with.

01:07.060 --> 01:09.730
What a strikingly attractive woman.

01:09.780 --> 01:11.020
Sir.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:24.220 --> 01:29.090
The bargain is done. Half her life.

01:31.420 --> 01:34.620
I have need of new companions.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.250
Lady Pole!

01:40.140 --> 01:42.060
LADY POLE!

03:46.140 --> 03:49.130
Mrs Strange! Oh, do
you visit Lady Pole?

03:49.180 --> 03:53.140
How very Christian
of you. How is she?

03:54.700 --> 03:56.050
She's very well.

03:56.100 --> 03:59.090
Sir Walter puts me off with
one excuse after another.

03:59.140 --> 04:02.490
It is always the same - Her Ladyship
is unwell or a little better,

04:02.540 --> 04:04.690
but never quite well
enough to see anybody.

04:04.740 --> 04:06.810
Apart from you, it would seem.

04:06.860 --> 04:09.530
If she is ill, then, of course,
the rabble must be kept away,

04:09.580 --> 04:12.170
but I saw her when she was a corpse.

04:12.220 --> 04:13.890
Oh, yes.

04:13.940 --> 04:17.769
You know, some people think that
her resurrection has made her proud

04:17.820 --> 04:20.730
and unwilling to mix
with ordinary mortals,

04:20.779 --> 04:23.410
but I think the truth
is quite different.

04:23.460 --> 04:28.250
I think it has bred in her a
taste for morbid experiences.

04:28.300 --> 04:29.890
What do YOU say?

04:29.940 --> 04:31.730
I beg your pardon, Mr Drawlight,

04:31.780 --> 04:34.650
but I am quite unable to give you
the information that you require.

04:34.700 --> 04:37.300
It'll be found out in the end.

04:40.140 --> 04:42.420
I ALWAYS find it out.

04:45.140 --> 04:47.340
Odious, odious little man.

04:49.940 --> 04:52.130
I am cheered to see you
so occupied, my Lady.

04:52.180 --> 04:55.730
This would look very pretty with
a little flower sewn on the sleeves.

04:55.780 --> 04:58.120
You may cut up those dresses.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.450
But they are so very fine.

05:01.500 --> 05:04.210
Perhaps. I have a more
important use for them now.

05:04.260 --> 05:05.770
Is this your wedding dress?

05:05.820 --> 05:07.290
Cut it up.

05:07.340 --> 05:11.010
M-My Lady, it may seem
a long time distant,

05:11.060 --> 05:14.130
but you may have a daughter one day.
It would give you great sorrow...

05:14.180 --> 05:15.930
I will have no daughter.

05:15.980 --> 05:18.370
I would not offer up a child,
least of all a little girl.

05:18.420 --> 05:21.290
They save up all their children
to pay off their tithes

05:21.340 --> 05:23.280
to the Lord of Hell.

05:24.740 --> 05:27.010
What does Your Ladyship sew?

05:27.060 --> 05:28.530
Lost-Hope.

05:29.540 --> 05:31.740
And who do you sew it for?

05:32.700 --> 05:34.260
For you.

05:38.820 --> 05:41.410
She is as secret as the grave, sir.

05:41.460 --> 05:44.450
There is no gossip to be had about
Lady Pole anywhere in town.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.660
I fear we shall never
discover her secrets.

05:54.260 --> 05:55.530
There.

06:19.140 --> 06:20.410
May I?

06:22.300 --> 06:24.650
If you're done with me
relieving folks of letters,

06:24.700 --> 06:27.700
I'll be off to see
a man about a school.

06:28.660 --> 06:29.970
Mrs Strange.

06:30.020 --> 06:32.090
Oh, Mr...

06:32.140 --> 06:35.410
How is your husband? Is he still...

06:35.460 --> 06:37.580
wherever he is?

06:39.460 --> 06:42.060
I, er... I have not heard from him.

06:43.060 --> 06:45.970
He is sure to be bored
at home, Madam,

06:46.020 --> 06:48.650
as soon as he has tasted war.

07:15.420 --> 07:16.890
Over here.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.730
Excuse me? Excuse me?

07:21.780 --> 07:23.920
Hello, I am the magician.

07:26.500 --> 07:29.090
I wonder where in Lisbon
I might find Wellington?

07:29.140 --> 07:31.770
LORD Wellington is not in Lisbon.

07:31.820 --> 07:33.090
Well, where am I to find him?

07:33.140 --> 07:35.450
Lord Wellington does not
stay in one place, sir.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.610
Lord Wellington goes
wherever he is needed.

07:37.660 --> 07:40.600
And Lord Wellington
is needed everywhere.

07:43.060 --> 07:45.170
His Lordship's in the Lines, sir.

07:45.220 --> 07:47.690
Ah, the Lines. Capital, capital.

07:48.820 --> 07:50.850
Altogether, come on.

07:50.900 --> 07:54.100
Can we get one of your friends and
find out what the Lines are, hmm?

08:13.940 --> 08:16.280
Excuse me, my good man. Er...

08:17.620 --> 08:18.820
Yes.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.040
Er... excuse me, I say...

08:23.460 --> 08:27.570
Winespill! The gunpowder! Winespill!

08:27.620 --> 08:29.820
Yes, sir! Right away, sir!

08:31.820 --> 08:34.010
Hello. I'm the magician.

08:34.059 --> 08:36.970
Are you indeed? Winespill!

08:37.020 --> 08:38.419
Yes, sir!

08:41.860 --> 08:44.530
Do you, by any chance, know when
Lord Wellington will come back?

08:44.580 --> 08:46.530
I do not. Lord Wellington is...

08:46.580 --> 08:48.980
In the Lines, yes. Yes, I know.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.370
They're only shooting squirrels.

08:58.620 --> 09:00.130
Norrell was quite correct -

09:00.180 --> 09:03.130
the position of magician is, by
no means, well enough respected.

09:03.180 --> 09:04.820
Winespill!

09:07.340 --> 09:09.450
I have them, sir.

09:09.500 --> 09:11.970
Some idiot was sitting in front.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.100
Attention!

09:32.940 --> 09:36.650
My orders were perfectly clear. I
think you were to take the cannon

09:36.700 --> 09:39.090
~ into the caves at Cartaxo.
~ In fairness to ourselves

09:39.140 --> 09:42.250
~ and the Portuguese...
~ Senator Hawkins, ask him how he considers

09:42.300 --> 09:44.450
~ we feed 200 men on eight chickens.
~ Yes, my Lord.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.970
You and the Portuguese drew
attention to the convoy,

09:47.020 --> 09:49.530
got my new artillery captured.
I had considered you my best

09:49.580 --> 09:50.930
Intelligence Officer, Grant.

09:50.980 --> 09:54.490
I'm gravely disappointed. Who
the devil do you think YOU are?

09:54.540 --> 09:57.490
~ The magician, my Lord.
~ Norris?
~ Um, Norrell, my Lord.

09:57.540 --> 10:00.290
But he is in London. I am Strange.

10:00.340 --> 10:03.530
Indeed. Grant, talk
to Capitan Saornil

10:03.580 --> 10:06.050
and the Guerrilleros.
Offer them as much gold

10:06.100 --> 10:07.810
as they can fill their pockets with.

10:07.860 --> 10:11.290
~ I must have those guns for the advance.
~ My Lord.
~ Er... my Lord.

10:11.340 --> 10:14.130
What I chiefly require, sir,
is more artillery and more men.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.810
~ Can you make them appear?
~ An interesting question, my Lord.

10:16.860 --> 10:19.450
In the book De Generibus
Artium Magicarum...

10:19.500 --> 10:22.490
I don't care about the book De
Generibus Artium Magicarum, sir.

10:22.540 --> 10:25.930
~ Can you make them appear or not?
~ I can make it rain, my Lord.

10:25.980 --> 10:28.930
It's rained all winter. It's
only just stopped raining.

10:28.980 --> 10:31.490
You and this other gentleman
have been a great nuisance

10:31.540 --> 10:34.210
to the army, sir. These visions
you've shown the ministers

10:34.260 --> 10:37.690
have convinced them they know
how matters stand in Portugal.

10:37.740 --> 10:40.650
They do not. Only I know what needs
to be done in Portugal, sir,

10:40.700 --> 10:43.090
because only I am acquainted
with all the circumstances.

10:43.140 --> 10:45.090
What I say is, I have no
need of a magician here.

10:45.140 --> 10:48.410
I could bring down a plague of
locusts upon the French, my Lord.

10:48.460 --> 10:51.970
~ Or frogs.
~ You'd do just as good to drop
roast chickens on them, sir!

10:52.020 --> 10:53.490
Goodnight!

11:04.140 --> 11:06.410
It looks very splendid, sir.

11:09.980 --> 11:11.520
Childermass.

11:14.660 --> 11:19.410
You cannot do this, sirs. You
must give up this notion.

11:19.460 --> 11:20.770
He'll get to know, sirs.

11:20.820 --> 11:24.330
And it would be better that you wind
up the business before he does.

11:24.380 --> 11:25.810
I did not sign that agreement.

11:25.860 --> 11:29.290
Do you think it matters? You
must choose some other business,

11:29.340 --> 11:31.010
not a school for magicians.

11:31.060 --> 11:33.650
The next time I hear that a lord

11:33.700 --> 11:35.930
or a lady has need of such a place,

11:35.980 --> 11:38.180
I will send them your way.

11:38.980 --> 11:41.250
I do not want another
kind of business.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.930
I'll be seeing you.

11:42.980 --> 11:46.410
This is tyranny, sir. This
is tyranny, pure and plain!

11:46.460 --> 11:48.130
Damn you, sir, and damn Mr Norrell!

11:48.180 --> 11:51.340
This way of doing business
will come back and haunt him!

11:54.020 --> 11:56.850
Well, my Lady, your tapestry
has come a long way.

11:56.900 --> 12:01.290
It is for you... to show the freedom
that has been taken from me.

12:01.340 --> 12:03.680
Come closer, I will show you.

12:04.260 --> 12:07.690
This is Stephen. This is
Stephen, the king-to-be.

12:07.740 --> 12:09.930
Here I am, with a rose at my mouth.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.850
The reason I cannot
speak clearly of it.

12:13.220 --> 12:15.290
Will you write to your
husband of this?

12:15.340 --> 12:18.340
Well, I write to my
husband of everything.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.530
I hope my letters cheer him.

12:20.580 --> 12:23.530
One from him would
certainly cheer me.

12:23.580 --> 12:26.370
We live in blackness and misery,
all the days of our lives.

12:26.420 --> 12:30.770
My Lady, you are surrounded
by many wonderful things.

12:30.820 --> 12:34.650
The love of your husband - do
you not consider it a blessing?

12:34.700 --> 12:37.330
My husband's love has
never done me any good.

12:37.380 --> 12:40.450
Never shortened a dreary
ball by so much as a minute.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.530
Do you consider your husband's love

12:42.580 --> 12:45.320
to have ever saved you from anything?

12:47.740 --> 12:51.240
Well, I think I am more in
the habit of saving HIM.

12:51.660 --> 12:53.610
Mr Strange is not the
most patient of men.

12:53.660 --> 12:55.810
Often, when people hector
him about magic...

12:55.860 --> 12:58.970
You will tell him. You
will write to Mr Strange.

12:59.020 --> 13:01.450
If Your Ladyship wishes, of course.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.780
Yes.

13:04.540 --> 13:07.380
He is the King of Lost-Hope.

13:09.940 --> 13:11.810
It's very striking.

13:12.940 --> 13:15.730
I thought I had explained myself.
I am making it for you.

13:15.780 --> 13:16.930
And I am very flattered...

13:16.980 --> 13:19.650
It is not a present for you because
you are my particular friend.

13:19.700 --> 13:21.930
It is because you are the
only person who will see me.

13:21.980 --> 13:24.170
It is because your
husband is who he is.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.690
~ My Lady!
~ Shh, Stephen!
~ Um... Perhaps I should, um...

13:26.740 --> 13:29.650
Mrs Strange, if I cannot say
it to you, I must show it.

13:29.700 --> 13:31.930
~ Lady Pole is there.
~ Mm-hm.

13:31.980 --> 13:34.810
Tell your husband!
Stephen, does she see?

13:34.860 --> 13:37.450
~ She doesn't see.
~ My Lady...

13:37.500 --> 13:39.240
She doesn't see.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.210
She doesn't see.

13:42.260 --> 13:43.730
'It is not easy for me to ask,'

13:43.780 --> 13:47.180
Sir Walter, I... I hope
you do not take it amiss.

13:48.660 --> 13:52.450
But it is a very hard thing
for a lady, or anyone,

13:52.500 --> 13:54.610
to fix their mind upon
cheerful thoughts

13:54.660 --> 13:58.530
when their circumstances
are so enclosed and dreary.

13:58.580 --> 14:01.210
Do you suppose I have not done
everything I can for my wife?

14:01.260 --> 14:04.530
~ No, I merely...
~ She does not have the will to go out.

14:04.580 --> 14:10.380
Bells, crowds, society - all these
things distress her. And if...

14:11.860 --> 14:15.210
Forgive me, Mrs Strange, this is to
remain strictly between ourselves.

14:15.260 --> 14:18.290
If she is allowed freedom
to go about the house,

14:18.340 --> 14:21.290
she has more than once
hurt herself very badly.

14:21.340 --> 14:22.930
Can you not speak to Mr Norrell?

14:22.980 --> 14:27.650
Mr Norrell says that magic
cannot cure... madness.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.370
She was not mad before the magic.

14:30.420 --> 14:32.170
She was dead, Madam.

14:32.220 --> 14:35.730
Perhaps there was some
irregularity with the spell?

14:35.780 --> 14:37.850
I asked Mr Strange about that.

14:37.900 --> 14:40.810
He could not bring himself to broach
the subject with his tutor.

14:40.860 --> 14:44.970
Your wife has asked me to
write to my husband, sir,

14:45.020 --> 14:47.730
and to tell him, well,
of the details of her...

14:47.780 --> 14:50.770
To the world beyond the doors
of Harley Street, Madam,

14:50.820 --> 14:55.380
beyond ourselves, Norrell and her doctors,
my wife is... merely unwell.

14:57.140 --> 15:00.010
You made me a promise when you asked
if you might continue to visit her

15:00.060 --> 15:01.930
that you would say nothing
of what she told.

15:01.980 --> 15:06.250
I expect you to keep that promise.
Even between husband and wife.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.220
Good afternoon.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.330
Whatever are we doing here, sir?

15:23.380 --> 15:25.210
This is the magician's house.

15:25.260 --> 15:28.250
Why, to discover her heart's
desires, Stephen.

15:28.300 --> 15:32.780
The very thing that she
would give her world for.

15:34.740 --> 15:37.930
Sir, must you take people like this?

15:37.980 --> 15:41.970
From the order of their house,
from those who love them?

15:42.020 --> 15:48.050
Oh, who loves her, Stephen? Not the
magician, he has abandoned her.

15:48.100 --> 15:52.700
Who loves Lady Pole with
her dreary disposition?

15:54.100 --> 15:55.900
And who loves you?

15:57.180 --> 16:01.130
No, it is best for you all to be
at my house, where it is known

16:01.180 --> 16:05.100
you are of kingly birth
and no-one frowns at this.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.290
I am so very tired, sir.

16:08.340 --> 16:10.930
We must listen to her, Stephen.

16:10.980 --> 16:17.660
We must pay very close attention
to what she says and what she does.

16:19.100 --> 16:22.380
We must find the correct moment.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.460
And when we have it...

16:30.060 --> 16:35.170
.. we can carry her to Lost-Hope,
where she will be loved

16:35.220 --> 16:42.660
and admired as no man has
loved or admired her before.

16:56.220 --> 16:58.180
Evening, gentlemen.

17:04.660 --> 17:06.900
Evening, Ned, Winespill.

17:14.780 --> 17:20.260
~ A devil of a job keeping
the dust out of one's tobacco.
~ It is, sir.

17:22.780 --> 17:25.050
Would you like some of mine?

17:26.700 --> 17:29.130
Thank you, sir. Drink, sir?

17:29.180 --> 17:31.140
~ Thirsty?
~ Thank you.

17:43.820 --> 17:47.140
Winespill, what is it
that you chiefly desire?

17:48.380 --> 17:50.290
What could a chap help you with?

17:50.340 --> 17:52.490
I know it is an odd question...

17:52.540 --> 17:54.170
Magic woman, sir.

17:54.220 --> 17:56.290
Toasted bloody cheese.

17:56.340 --> 17:58.050
Here, sir.

17:58.100 --> 18:00.100
Oh, thank you, Jeremy.

18:08.260 --> 18:09.930
Excuse me, sir?

18:10.540 --> 18:13.730
Er... you're the fella with
all the books, isn't it?

18:13.780 --> 18:15.810
Do... do you need... magic?

18:15.860 --> 18:18.300
Er, no.

18:23.220 --> 18:24.580
Sir.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.130
"My dearest Ned.

18:29.180 --> 18:32.460
"It pains my heart to say
it to you, my love, but..."

18:34.500 --> 18:35.940
But what?

18:37.340 --> 18:40.770
".. but I have spoiled
our wedding china

18:40.820 --> 18:44.050
"by spilling a pan of jam upon it."

18:45.900 --> 18:47.700
Bloody old bitch.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.090
Who is it, then?

18:51.140 --> 18:54.610
Thomas Potter, eh?
Bloody Thomas Potter.

18:54.660 --> 18:56.300
Sorry, Ned.

19:02.540 --> 19:04.170
I am expecting a parcel.

19:04.220 --> 19:06.250
Does she not say anything
about me boots?

19:06.300 --> 19:09.050
~ Boots?
~ I asked her to send new boots, sir.

19:09.100 --> 19:12.330
I'm sorry, she... she
merely sends her love.

19:12.380 --> 19:16.570
Damn Portuguese roads, they
tear a man's boots to ribbons.

19:16.620 --> 19:20.290
What's the use in love, when
she could have sent boots?

19:20.340 --> 19:23.380
Break it up, lads. Heads
down, heads down.

19:25.820 --> 19:27.490
Goodnight, sir.

19:28.420 --> 19:29.890
Goodnight.

20:01.660 --> 20:04.770
.. Reverend Wilson called
out, "Vive la France!"

20:07.580 --> 20:11.810
Ah, been sleeping in the mountains,
have you? Have some breakfast.

20:11.860 --> 20:13.730
Thank you, my Lord.

20:15.300 --> 20:18.040
How do you like the war, Mr... um...?

20:19.380 --> 20:23.050
Oh, it was rather confusing at
first, but I grow used to it.

20:23.100 --> 20:26.930
I have been robbed once.
I have been shot at once.

20:26.980 --> 20:30.130
Once I found a Frenchman in the
tent and had to chase him out.

20:30.180 --> 20:32.650
And once, the house I was
sleeping in was set on fire.

20:32.700 --> 20:33.770
By the French?

20:33.820 --> 20:36.130
No. No, sir. By the English.

20:36.180 --> 20:39.250
It was a company of the 43rd,
who were very cold that night.

20:39.300 --> 20:41.490
Set fire to the house,
to warm themselves.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.170
Oh, that always happens.

20:43.220 --> 20:45.530
Finest fellows in the
world, the British Army.

20:45.580 --> 20:49.620
I heard Your Lordship refers to
them as "the scum of the earth".

20:50.780 --> 20:53.970
Well, they're both. At
one and the same time.

20:54.020 --> 20:57.730
We've been talking - arguing, rather
- about magic, how it's done.

20:57.780 --> 21:00.170
Major Grant here says you and
this other chap have given

21:00.220 --> 21:01.970
every word in the Bible a number.

21:02.020 --> 21:04.650
And then you think of
words to make up a spell

21:04.700 --> 21:06.770
and you add up the
numbers and then...

21:06.820 --> 21:08.530
That... That is not
what I said, my Lord.

21:08.580 --> 21:10.650
You have not understood, at all.

21:10.700 --> 21:13.330
I'm afraid I've done
nothing resembling it.

21:13.380 --> 21:17.410
It seems rather complicated and
I do not think it would work.

21:17.460 --> 21:20.970
As to doing magic, my Lord,
there are many procedures,

21:21.020 --> 21:23.130
as many, I dare say,
as for making war.

21:23.180 --> 21:24.770
Good and evil.

21:24.820 --> 21:27.420
Can a magician kill a man by magic?

21:28.780 --> 21:31.120
I suppose a magician might...

21:32.340 --> 21:35.060
.. but a gentleman never could.

21:38.300 --> 21:42.890
This road, sir, which you have
been so good as to offer us -

21:42.940 --> 21:45.340
what sort of road would it be?

21:58.380 --> 22:00.520
Give me Stokesy, Jeremy.

23:22.740 --> 23:24.370
Very good.

23:24.420 --> 23:26.220
That should do it.

23:28.300 --> 23:30.170
Come on, Jeremy.

23:44.340 --> 23:47.250
No, really, I have hardly
any criticisms to make.

23:47.300 --> 23:48.530
It's an excellent road.

23:48.580 --> 23:54.570
Only, make it a little straighter
tomorrow, if you will, Merlin(!)

23:54.620 --> 23:57.770
Er...not Merlin, my
Lord, if you please.

23:57.820 --> 23:59.890
~ Why ever not?
~ Well...

23:59.940 --> 24:03.330
Merlin, if indeed he existed,
was a very vagabonding type,

24:03.380 --> 24:05.610
not the modern kind
of magician, at all.

24:05.660 --> 24:09.130
Mr Norrell and I are endeavouring
to make magic respectable, my Lord.

24:09.180 --> 24:11.330
You'll have a job, sir. This is war.

24:11.380 --> 24:14.250
Besides, I've got to
call you something.

24:15.140 --> 24:16.410
~ Strange?
~ Ah.

24:16.460 --> 24:18.690
Merlin, it is, then.

25:02.780 --> 25:04.490
What are you tutting at?

25:04.540 --> 25:06.050
This post-boy, is he to be trusted?

25:06.100 --> 25:09.300
I'm giving him a pound a week.
What does the letter say?

25:12.580 --> 25:14.380
A deal about love.

25:16.260 --> 25:19.530
He writes to her of love
and doggerel poems

25:19.580 --> 25:22.250
and she writes to him of
heartache and dresses...

25:22.300 --> 25:25.400
I'm not easy about this
business, Mr Norrell.

25:25.940 --> 25:27.210
I have to say it.

25:27.260 --> 25:28.610
There, you have said it.

25:28.660 --> 25:31.260
I want to know what the matter is.

25:32.220 --> 25:36.090
If you wish my assistance
in these matters...

25:36.140 --> 25:39.650
These concerns are not frivolous
or prurient, Childermass.

25:39.700 --> 25:41.450
I should think you knew me better.

25:41.500 --> 25:43.500
I know you very well.

25:46.380 --> 25:48.720
I am concerned Lady Pole m...

25:49.900 --> 25:52.410
Well, as you know, she
is visited by Mrs Strange.

25:52.460 --> 25:54.530
I am concerned that they talk.

25:54.580 --> 25:58.890
Well, naturally they
talk. They are women.

25:58.940 --> 26:02.380
What should they talk about that
might harm you, Mr Norrell?

26:04.980 --> 26:08.740
If you tell it me,
it may be I can help.

26:11.940 --> 26:13.820
There is something.

27:41.820 --> 27:44.970
There's another encampment over the
other side of the forest, my Lord.

27:45.020 --> 27:47.370
French soldiers of the 9th.
And they have with them

27:47.420 --> 27:49.290
all of the armaments from Cartaxo.

27:49.340 --> 27:51.850
My cannon? My pretty new artillery?

27:51.900 --> 27:54.930
Exactly so, my Lord. Now, if we were
to take the 7th up along the hill...

27:54.980 --> 27:57.410
No, that would take too much
time. I am in a hurry.

27:57.460 --> 27:58.490
Where's the magician?

27:58.540 --> 28:02.170
~ Here, sir.
~ I would counsel against
placing too much reliance...

28:02.220 --> 28:04.690
Yes, Grant, I'm sure you
would. Ah, there you are.

28:04.740 --> 28:08.530
There, the assorted gentlemen
of the 7th Division,

28:08.580 --> 28:12.610
and here, General D'Erlon's French,
with their backs to us.

28:12.660 --> 28:16.170
Now, if you'd be so kind as
to move this forest, I think

28:16.220 --> 28:18.930
we might very well give them
an unpleasant surprise.

28:18.980 --> 28:21.570
~ A forest, my Lord?
~ Hmm.

28:21.620 --> 28:24.730
That is a different kind
of magic to that which...

28:24.780 --> 28:26.690
~ It is not modern magic.
~ So?

28:26.740 --> 28:28.130
It is not straightforward.

28:28.180 --> 28:30.610
I would think one would have
to negotiate with the trees.

28:30.660 --> 28:33.210
You've moved churches and rivers.
I cannot think it would be

28:33.260 --> 28:35.530
so difficult to move a forest
- it is not so very large.

28:35.580 --> 28:37.010
These are living things, my Lord.

28:37.060 --> 28:39.010
They will have humours of their own.

28:39.060 --> 28:40.810
They may not care for soldiers.

28:40.860 --> 28:44.050
Perhaps we have reached the limits
of your abilities, Mr Strange.

28:44.100 --> 28:47.250
Grant. Daylight, take a few men and
escort Mr Strange into the forest.

28:47.300 --> 28:49.250
Do your best to see he's not shot...

28:49.300 --> 28:51.490
~ at least till he's moved it.
~ My Lord.

28:51.540 --> 28:53.940
We wait your convenience, sir.

28:59.380 --> 29:02.660
~ Jeremy, pack my books.
~ Which ones, sir?
~ All of them.

29:11.780 --> 29:14.970
Must you crunch and crackle
like that, Mr Strange?

29:15.020 --> 29:17.690
I have no wish to disturb
the French. It is lunchtime.

29:17.740 --> 29:19.330
They will not be happy.

29:19.380 --> 29:21.650
I must find the oldest tree.

29:22.060 --> 29:24.450
I can't see much of an age from here.

29:24.500 --> 29:27.940
Perhaps we should cut them all
down and count the rings(!)

29:34.860 --> 29:36.660
This one, perhaps?

29:36.940 --> 29:38.280
Jeremy.

29:43.580 --> 29:45.260
Heavensy.

30:20.980 --> 30:22.380
Is he...

30:23.460 --> 30:25.600
.. talking to the trees?

30:36.940 --> 30:40.610
His Lordship asked you to move these
trees, not lead them in song.

30:40.660 --> 30:42.490
Do your work quietly, sir.

30:42.540 --> 30:44.260
I am trying.

30:46.820 --> 30:50.010
~ Les Anglaises sont la!
~ Mr Strange!
~ Quiet!

30:50.060 --> 30:52.770
~ You have drawn their notice!
~ Quiet!

30:52.820 --> 30:54.620
Commence firing!

30:56.100 --> 30:58.040
On your right, fire!

30:58.860 --> 31:00.490
Steady!

31:00.540 --> 31:02.080
Stand fast!

31:04.300 --> 31:09.210
~ Mr Strange, move this forest!
~ Can I not call down a mist?
~ No!

31:09.260 --> 31:12.610
They are turning their cannon
about. Follow your orders.

31:12.660 --> 31:14.820
Jeremy, find me Ormskirk.

31:18.380 --> 31:20.020
Artillery!

31:56.060 --> 31:58.140
Argh!

32:03.260 --> 32:07.540
~ Jeremy.
~ Oh, sir. Your books.

32:09.260 --> 32:11.860
I'm sorry for it, sir.

32:13.580 --> 32:15.980
Here is one... that's left.

32:26.740 --> 32:28.890
Stand your ground!

32:28.940 --> 32:31.410
Captain, let's fill this flank!

32:31.460 --> 32:33.300
Hold your places!

32:52.460 --> 32:57.130
Mr Strange. Mr Strange,
this mist - is it yours?

32:57.180 --> 32:59.260
Mr Strange!

33:02.500 --> 33:04.810
General D'Erlon and the
French have fled, my Lord.

33:04.860 --> 33:08.570
Singing trees and sudden miasmas
seemed to be too much for them.

33:08.620 --> 33:13.490
Taking my cannon with them. I
did not ask for mist, Merlin.

33:13.540 --> 33:16.010
I asked you to move those trees.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.650
I lost my books, my
Lord. I apologise.

33:18.700 --> 33:20.650
I've exhausted everything I know.

33:20.700 --> 33:24.400
~ I've a good mind to put you on a charge.
~ Well, do it!

33:24.900 --> 33:28.050
You've made me rely upon you. I will
not have you let me down again.

33:28.100 --> 33:30.730
I regularly demand the impossible
of my engineers, generals

33:30.780 --> 33:33.980
and officers. I see no reason to
make an exception in your case.

33:35.260 --> 33:38.460
~ I'm at the limit of my magic.
~ Find other magic!

33:45.340 --> 33:47.330
Do not give yourself too much grief.

33:47.380 --> 33:53.570
Your mist may have lost him his
cannon, but... it saved our lives.

33:53.620 --> 33:55.340
Most of us.

33:59.860 --> 34:04.380
Come. Mackenzie has a burial detail.
He'll see your man right.

34:39.060 --> 34:40.929
How has she been, Stephen?

34:40.980 --> 34:42.449
Madam...

34:42.500 --> 34:46.250
I know it's not my place,
but may I speak frankly?

34:46.300 --> 34:47.969
Of course.

34:48.020 --> 34:51.300
I do not think it's wise for
you to visit Her Ladyship.

34:53.980 --> 34:56.650
I thought you were my friend
in this, Mr Black.

34:56.699 --> 34:59.250
I am your friend, please believe it,

34:59.300 --> 35:01.900
but I fear there is danger for you.

35:06.180 --> 35:10.420
Lady Pole. Madam, please,
will you help me?

35:17.140 --> 35:19.580
Oh, God.

35:22.220 --> 35:23.890
Get Sir Walter.

35:31.220 --> 35:32.730
My dear, Sir Walter...

35:32.780 --> 35:36.420
~ Er, Sir Walter. If you'd be so kind.
~ Please excuse me.

35:54.460 --> 35:56.800
What is your distress, Madam?

35:59.300 --> 36:01.380
I am sad for my friend.

36:02.820 --> 36:04.170
Why in the world

36:04.220 --> 36:06.250
would you be sad for her?

36:06.300 --> 36:09.900
Because she is beset by such horrors.

36:11.380 --> 36:14.250
Lady Pole has no horrors.

36:14.300 --> 36:16.250
She merely has a rose...

36:16.300 --> 36:17.690
at her mouth.

36:17.740 --> 36:19.580
A rose?

36:22.260 --> 36:25.090
Why, I could take that away...

36:25.140 --> 36:26.610
as easy as breathing.

36:26.660 --> 36:30.130
~ What do you mean?
~ That I could remove what they please to call

36:30.180 --> 36:31.720
my Lady's...

36:32.780 --> 36:34.320
.. madness.

36:35.100 --> 36:37.300
And how would you do that?

36:38.380 --> 36:41.810
I would need your help, Madam.

36:41.860 --> 36:44.140
Your... assent.

36:46.020 --> 36:50.770
But I should not ask for anything
that would not be exquisitely

36:50.820 --> 36:55.130
desirable to you.

36:55.180 --> 36:57.940
You ask for something in return, sir?

36:59.900 --> 37:01.370
If you can do such a thing,

37:01.420 --> 37:04.660
if it is with in your power to help,
then, for the love of God, do it.

37:06.220 --> 37:09.090
But do not make a bargain
of my friend.

37:09.620 --> 37:11.760
You will forgive me, sir.

37:13.060 --> 37:16.660
We should not meet again
without my husband present.

37:35.020 --> 37:38.170
General Caffarelli was intending
to bring the cannon to the French

37:38.220 --> 37:41.970
at Vitoria. The good news is
that the cannon never arrived.

37:42.020 --> 37:46.090
Caffarelli made up his escort of the
first 30 soldiers that came to hand.

37:46.140 --> 37:48.930
10 of those 30 were Neapolitan.

37:48.980 --> 37:52.010
~ Were they indeed?
~ It is my view that they killed the others

37:52.060 --> 37:54.610
and will shortly try to sell the
cannon to the highest bidder.

37:54.660 --> 37:57.570
~ Why have we not heard from them?
~ They have been sending messages

37:57.620 --> 38:00.730
to their relatives in the French
army to desert and join them.

38:00.780 --> 38:02.690
They believe that, with the money
they will get for the cannon,

38:02.740 --> 38:06.010
they will all be able to sail back
to Naples together in a golden ship.

38:06.060 --> 38:08.250
And they do not wish to return
home to face their mothers

38:08.300 --> 38:10.730
and aunts without bringing their
relatives back with them.

38:10.780 --> 38:13.090
Yes, I've always heard Italian
women are rather fierce.

38:13.140 --> 38:16.090
But we cannot wait for
100 Neapolitans to desert.

38:16.140 --> 38:18.450
All we need do is find some
Neapolitans and question them.

38:18.500 --> 38:21.930
They will have been informed of where the thieves
are and where they have put the guns.

38:21.980 --> 38:24.290
Unfortunately, the only
Neapolitans we've encountered

38:24.340 --> 38:26.050
have been dead ones
on the battlefield.

38:26.100 --> 38:28.210
Sir, make yourself useful.

38:28.260 --> 38:31.050
I require a vision of some
Neapolitans and some guns.

38:31.100 --> 38:35.010
As I said, my Lord, visions are
precisely the wrong kind of magic
for this sort of thing.

38:35.060 --> 38:37.130
I must have the location
of my guns, by morning.

38:37.180 --> 38:39.450
Kindly bend yourself to it.

38:45.780 --> 38:47.370
Do you recognise anything, Merlin?

38:47.420 --> 38:52.450
Olive groves and pine trees. Could
be anywhere within 100 miles.

38:52.500 --> 38:55.370
Perhaps they're saying
something useful.

38:59.500 --> 39:01.210
I do not understand the language.

39:01.260 --> 39:04.450
It mostly concerns the food
they wish they were eating

39:04.500 --> 39:07.240
and the charms of their absent wives.

39:09.460 --> 39:11.170
Are you married, Major Grant?

39:11.220 --> 39:13.210
A soldier has no business
marrying, sir.

39:13.260 --> 39:16.170
It is unfair on the man
and unfair on the wife.

39:16.220 --> 39:19.850
You did not think to come to war
for jokes and picnics, Mr Strange?

39:19.900 --> 39:21.900
I did not consider it.

39:24.660 --> 39:27.490
I'm sorry, Major Grant, I
can think of nothing else.

39:27.540 --> 39:30.370
Perhaps you have some Neapolitans
among the prisoners?

39:30.420 --> 39:35.210
No, sir, we do not. You might
expect that we checked.

39:35.260 --> 39:39.160
We have some dead ones, for
all the good that will do us.

39:40.820 --> 39:42.620
What? What is it?

39:51.620 --> 39:55.610
The magic I will do this night
is not... modern magic.

39:55.660 --> 39:58.180
In fact, it is very ancient.

40:00.020 --> 40:02.620
It is the magic of the Raven King.

40:04.260 --> 40:07.300
I do not wish it to be
mentioned in dispatches.

40:08.700 --> 40:10.840
You have my word, Merlin.

40:16.980 --> 40:18.980
Enough. That's enough.

40:20.300 --> 40:22.050
Is that for the magic?

40:22.100 --> 40:24.040
It is for the smell.

40:25.140 --> 40:27.810
I thought I told you no-one was
to interfere with these corpses.

40:27.860 --> 40:31.060
None of the lads has touched
them, Mr Strange.

40:32.740 --> 40:35.530
I do not see they are so mutilated.
Does it matter if they are?

40:35.580 --> 40:38.580
I suppose not. Only,
I have to look at them.

40:39.740 --> 40:41.880
Sharp knife, please, Ned.

41:05.420 --> 41:07.220
Borrowed life.

41:08.220 --> 41:10.370
Borrowed life.

41:10.420 --> 41:12.450
Borrowed life.

42:10.420 --> 42:12.900
Dear God. What language is that?

42:14.500 --> 42:18.060
I believe it may be one
of the dialects of Hell.

42:20.300 --> 42:23.820
They've learnt it very quickly.
Can YOU speak this language?

42:32.380 --> 42:34.810
~ Signore.
~ Is that Italian?

42:34.860 --> 42:37.610
~ Be my guest.
~ Ah, that's more like it.

42:37.660 --> 42:40.250
Come along, Grant, ask
them where our guns are.

42:40.300 --> 42:47.050
Quindici cannoni - tuo amico ha rubato
dal Generale Caparelli. Dove sono?

42:54.220 --> 42:56.770
Dove hanno viso i cannoni?

42:56.820 --> 43:00.210
La chiesa... San Giacomo...

43:00.260 --> 43:03.170
We have it, sir. It's in a
small town called San Giacomo

43:03.220 --> 43:06.210
on the road to Vitoria. They've
hidden it by the church.

43:06.260 --> 43:08.490
We shall have the guns by morning.

43:08.540 --> 43:10.810
This is it, my dear Merlin!

43:12.140 --> 43:13.810
That was easy. Come on.

43:13.860 --> 43:16.060
Good man, Merlin.

43:42.540 --> 43:45.450
~ You.
~ My Lady. You have murdered me.

43:45.500 --> 43:46.970
No, that was not my intention.

43:47.020 --> 43:48.570
Do you know what you did, sir?

43:48.620 --> 43:50.290
Madam, I was tricked.

43:50.340 --> 43:54.090
Were it not for the very particular
circumstances, I would...

43:54.140 --> 43:56.930
What I did, I did to further
the cause of English magic

43:56.980 --> 44:00.530
and to help win this war in which
innocent people must suffer, too.

44:00.580 --> 44:03.610
~ What can be done?
~ I cannot free you of
this enchantment, my Lady.

44:03.660 --> 44:05.170
No!

44:05.220 --> 44:09.170
You have opened a door to Hell and
invited the devil into England.

44:09.220 --> 44:10.610
Shh... I beg you.

44:10.660 --> 44:13.130
I beg you to stop trying to persuade
Mrs Strange or anyone else

44:13.180 --> 44:15.410
to understand your
predicament. Please, please...

44:15.460 --> 44:19.050
Do not try to communicate using
tapestries or the like.

44:19.100 --> 44:23.050
It cannot do you any good and
it may cause you further harm.

44:23.100 --> 44:24.330
And it...

44:24.380 --> 44:26.570
Further harm?!

44:26.620 --> 44:29.090
How old are you, my Lady? Forgive me.

44:29.140 --> 44:30.770
I am 19.

44:30.820 --> 44:33.690
I may tell you that you
will live another 75 years

44:33.740 --> 44:35.940
under these circumstances.

44:36.660 --> 44:41.060
~ No.
~ I'm sorry.
~ No! Mr Norrell. Mr Norrell!

44:43.700 --> 44:47.210
Mr Norrell! Mr Norrell!

44:47.260 --> 44:49.780
Nothing at all has changed.

44:50.900 --> 44:53.240
Thank you for your help, sir.

44:55.460 --> 44:58.330
Nothing can be gained
by her excitement.

44:59.220 --> 45:03.210
I understand that certain ladies
wish to occupy themselves

45:03.260 --> 45:05.610
in what they consider charity.

45:05.660 --> 45:09.410
But it seems to me that all that
has been achieved has been

45:09.460 --> 45:11.770
to harm Her Ladyship even further.

45:11.820 --> 45:18.580
I worry that these two ladies merely
exercise one another's emotion.

45:20.180 --> 45:23.480
I would suggest that these
visits are curtailed.

45:38.540 --> 45:39.930
Merlin?

45:43.820 --> 45:47.370
Merlin? Merlin, where are you?

45:47.420 --> 45:50.010
What the devil are
you doing up there?

45:50.060 --> 45:53.060
I do not know how to
make them dead again.

45:53.660 --> 45:56.330
Set them loose and let
them wander in the bushes.

45:56.380 --> 45:58.690
We have the French on the
run and we need to press on.

45:58.740 --> 46:00.410
His Lordship is asking for you.

46:00.460 --> 46:03.000
We haven't seen you in days, man.

46:04.260 --> 46:06.930
Look at them, poor wretches
- what do they say?

46:06.980 --> 46:10.650
They, er... plead with you
not to send them back to Hell.

46:10.700 --> 46:14.420
They ask you to send them home to
their little sons and daughters.

46:15.900 --> 46:18.500
There is such power in this magic.

46:19.020 --> 46:21.410
I cannot in any way reverse
it. I've tried everything.

46:21.460 --> 46:23.780
Everything?

46:32.580 --> 46:36.050
Merlin, oblige me by leaving
off trying to kill people

46:36.100 --> 46:38.210
who are already dead,
cheering yourself up

46:38.260 --> 46:40.490
and moving the bridge at
the end of the valley.

46:40.540 --> 46:44.690
The bridge, sir - away from
General D'Erlon's French

46:44.740 --> 46:46.250
and where my cannons may cross.

46:46.300 --> 46:50.450
Victory is within our sights and
we may lance this Spanish ulcer

46:50.500 --> 46:53.370
and return home to our
wives and mistresses.

46:53.420 --> 46:55.220
That is an order.

46:57.100 --> 46:59.240
At your command, my Lord.

47:01.900 --> 47:05.850
Grant, lock these corpses
in and set the mill on fire.

47:05.900 --> 47:09.180
~ They're distracting my magician.
~ My Lord.

47:44.380 --> 47:46.930
I'll lead your horse around, sir.

47:46.980 --> 47:48.980
Thank you, Winespill.

48:25.860 --> 48:27.690
May I come in?

48:27.740 --> 48:29.650
What is the matter, Stephen?

48:29.700 --> 48:33.930
I am instructed that Lady Pole
is not to receive visitors.

48:33.980 --> 48:37.050
~ Let me through, Stephen. This is ridiculous.
~ Madam, please.

48:37.100 --> 48:40.690
Believe me when I tell you
that it is for the best.

48:40.740 --> 48:45.180
~ Stephen...
~ Madam, in 1349 there was
a parson called Dundridge.

48:47.460 --> 48:50.250
He was followed by a tiny
man that dragged him

48:50.300 --> 48:53.730
into a pot to meet his many wives.

48:53.780 --> 48:55.980
I'm sorry, madam.

49:15.220 --> 49:19.020
You were right. It is
best she does not come.

49:51.020 --> 49:54.690
I have been meaning to offer
you an apology, Stephen,

49:54.740 --> 49:56.290
and an explanation.

49:56.340 --> 49:58.210
No explanation is necessary, sir.

49:58.260 --> 50:03.130
My recent concern for the magician's
wife has rather prevented us

50:03.180 --> 50:07.940
discussing the matter
of you becoming a king.

50:09.700 --> 50:14.820
But I have begun to realise how
very useful such a thing might be.

50:16.940 --> 50:23.770
It has been the cruellest thing in
the world, how she has spurned me.

50:23.820 --> 50:26.130
I cannot break her resolve.

50:26.180 --> 50:29.850
The husband will soon return,
and I am sorry to say,

50:29.900 --> 50:33.850
a magician is not an
easy thing to kill.

50:33.900 --> 50:39.460
Especially not one who seems
intent on monopolising me.

50:41.180 --> 50:44.300
But if you were to be a king...

50:46.420 --> 50:49.250
Sir, I have been for some years

50:49.300 --> 50:52.410
the king of my own little
land in Harley Street.

50:52.460 --> 50:56.170
I flatter myself known amongst
the best servants in London.

50:56.220 --> 50:58.490
If you wish to do me a kindness...

50:58.540 --> 51:04.770
It is not unusual, Stephen, for
a slave to take his master's side.

51:04.820 --> 51:09.770
The Raven King himself began
life as a nameless slave

51:09.820 --> 51:13.690
in a fairy kingdom, and
rose to great heights.

51:13.740 --> 51:15.250
I am not a slave, sir.

51:15.300 --> 51:18.740
No man who stands on English
soil can be a slave.

51:20.100 --> 51:23.060
Sir Walter's father
- he was kind to me.

51:24.660 --> 51:26.690
He had me christened and educated.

51:26.740 --> 51:28.660
Christened?

51:30.860 --> 51:33.370
What was the name...

51:33.420 --> 51:36.420
your mother gave you?

51:39.180 --> 51:40.500
I...

51:43.940 --> 51:45.930
I don't know.

51:45.980 --> 51:47.740
Indeed.

51:51.780 --> 51:53.540
Come.

51:54.620 --> 51:57.210
Out of my love for you, Stephen,

51:57.260 --> 52:01.770
I have prised guts out of dying men

52:01.820 --> 52:03.960
to discover your future.

52:06.020 --> 52:10.540
Magic cannot tell the future
but it can throw shadows.

52:11.540 --> 52:16.180
It is said you are to kill
the king and take his place.

52:25.100 --> 52:26.970
What is this place?

52:28.060 --> 52:31.900
Why, this is the place
of your birth, Stephen!

52:37.940 --> 52:40.010
There is your mother...

52:41.580 --> 52:44.420
.. about to whisper your name.

52:56.260 --> 52:58.770
My...

52:58.820 --> 53:01.540
mother.

53:07.820 --> 53:10.930
This is the ship of
Sir Walter's family,

53:10.980 --> 53:14.250
where you were born a slave

53:14.300 --> 53:17.740
and your mother died a slave.

53:18.900 --> 53:21.500
This is what has been done to you.

53:22.540 --> 53:25.570
This is what has been taken from you.

53:25.620 --> 53:29.540
I can make you king.

54:11.300 --> 54:13.290
Oh, madam!

54:13.340 --> 54:15.170
What is it?

54:15.220 --> 54:17.100
Mary?

54:25.620 --> 54:27.490
I am home.

54:29.900 --> 54:31.700
Oh...

54:35.500 --> 54:37.380
Oh...

54:42.380 --> 54:44.450
Oh, G...

54:57.460 --> 55:00.820
Jonathan, I cannot keep my countenance
if you stare at me like that.

55:02.220 --> 55:04.970
Sorry to disappoint you, but you
never do look at me so very often.

55:05.020 --> 55:07.410
You always had your nose
in some dusty old book.

55:07.460 --> 55:10.970
I had entirely forgotten how
quarrelsome you are, Mrs Strange.

55:13.020 --> 55:14.410
Jonathan...

55:14.460 --> 55:17.740
Beg pardon, sir. Mr
Norrell to see you.

56:02.140 --> 56:04.690
Some water!

56:04.740 --> 56:07.610
It's all very well for you, Henry,

56:07.660 --> 56:09.330
you have periodicals to edit.

56:09.380 --> 56:11.410
You're writing your book about him.

56:11.460 --> 56:12.930
I need some new lorgnettes.

56:12.980 --> 56:15.170
Answer some of his letters,
I will give you a guinea.

56:15.220 --> 56:17.370
Tell them Mr Norrell does
not accept commissions.

56:17.420 --> 56:19.850
~ What on earth are you doing?
~ Has Strange been here?

56:19.900 --> 56:21.010
Of course he's not.

56:21.060 --> 56:24.460
Where's Norrell? Someone
is doing magic here.

56:31.260 --> 56:33.700
Childermass.

56:41.580 --> 56:44.690
I'm so glad that you're home,
sir. I am so relieved.

56:44.740 --> 56:47.370
Lascelles and Drawlight have
been in my house a great deal.

56:47.420 --> 56:48.810
I'm sure of it.

56:48.860 --> 56:50.970
But there is no talking
to them of magic.

56:51.020 --> 56:54.250
No. No, you must come to my
house tomorrow. You must...

56:54.300 --> 56:57.170
Thank you... You must
come for breakfast, sir.

56:57.220 --> 57:00.330
And you can tell me in great detail
all the different types of magic

57:00.380 --> 57:03.930
that you employed and
you can return my books.

57:03.980 --> 57:06.220
Yes. Yes.

57:08.380 --> 57:10.860
Your books.

57:14.860 --> 57:17.090
