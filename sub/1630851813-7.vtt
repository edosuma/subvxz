19:22.073 --> 19:24.250
wants one,
it could be to reassess a bail

19:24.293 --> 19:27.209
that was previously denied
or set too high,

19:27.253 --> 19:29.951
or if the arresting officer
did something wrong,

19:29.994 --> 19:32.780
they could get the whole trial
thrown out.

19:32.823 --> 19:33.868
Well, who arrested Serano?

19:34.869 --> 19:36.436
James, Micki and Cordi.

19:36.479 --> 19:37.567
I mean,

19:37.611 --> 19:40.222
I... filed the false report

19:40.266 --> 19:41.571
when we went up
north together

19:41.615 --> 19:44.357
for the Serano case.But he has nothing to do

19:44.400 --> 19:45.880
with your false report, right?

19:45.923 --> 19:47.838
♪ Whoa, the sun has gone
to burnin'... ♪

19:47.882 --> 19:49.840
So stupid.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.233
What?

19:51.277 --> 19:54.105
I just kept replaying
what I did wrong,

19:54.149 --> 19:55.498
but if I don't make
that statement,

19:55.542 --> 19:57.935
they're gonna use
Cordi's past misconduct

19:57.979 --> 19:59.763
to say that he is lying.

19:59.807 --> 20:02.331
And then they can throw out
Serano's whole case.

20:02.375 --> 20:05.116
Okay, you have to take me
to Ranger HQ.You're blitzed.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.683
I'm not taking you anywhere.They... they
have coffee

20:06.727 --> 20:08.207
at HQ.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.991
James will be there.
He set up my statement

20:10.034 --> 20:11.297
for today.

20:11.340 --> 20:12.602
Please.

20:12.646 --> 20:14.735
Otherwise, I got
to call a ride.

20:14.778 --> 20:15.736
Give me a break.

20:15.779 --> 20:16.911
Fine.

20:16.954 --> 20:18.565
All right, fine.

20:18.608 --> 20:21.307
Okay, but you are driving.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.400
Pallino thrown!

20:27.443 --> 20:28.705
Let's go, Stella Blue!

20:28.749 --> 20:30.707
Nice job with the lingo, Dad.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.318
You know, honestly,
I am at a disadvantage

20:32.361 --> 20:33.971
because this was
your mom's game.

20:34.015 --> 20:36.583
I'll do my best,
but you might have
to go easy on me.

20:36.626 --> 20:38.672
It's a game-- it's
supposed to be relaxing.

20:38.715 --> 20:40.021
Relaxing?Mm-hmm.

20:40.064 --> 20:42.023
Please.
Your mother was cutthroat.

20:42.066 --> 20:43.067
[laughs]: Yeah.

20:43.111 --> 20:45.766
So, because your ball is closer

20:45.809 --> 20:48.159
to the little ball there,
the pallino...

20:48.203 --> 20:49.596
I get to go next.

20:49.639 --> 20:51.250
And, you know,
you want to get your guys

20:51.293 --> 20:52.990
as close to it as possible,

20:53.034 --> 20:54.905
but...

20:54.949 --> 20:56.820
you also want
to make sure

20:56.864 --> 20:58.039
that your opponent

20:58.082 --> 20:59.606
stays far away.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.782
Mom, that is so mean.

21:01.825 --> 21:03.305
Well, as your Granny Nancy
used to say,

21:03.349 --> 21:05.525
it's not mean, it's strategic.
[laughs]

21:05.568 --> 21:07.091
Okay, so, now...

21:07.135 --> 21:09.050
you want to look
at all the pieces on the court,

21:09.093 --> 21:12.009
and you decide
how you want to play.

21:14.621 --> 21:17.624
So, your mom taught you
all that, huh?

21:18.494 --> 21:20.191
Smart lady.

21:20.235 --> 21:23.891
She always said it was about
how it all worked together.

21:23.934 --> 21:26.894
And maybe...

21:26.937 --> 21:29.026
don't make
a bad choice

21:29.070 --> 21:30.724
just to spite the other person.

21:31.768 --> 21:35.381
Are you trying to, uh, double-
meaning a round of boccie?

21:36.382 --> 21:38.384
Well, if I were...

21:38.427 --> 21:40.516
[electronic ding]...whatever could it
possible relate to

21:40.560 --> 21:42.388
in our own lives?

21:44.738 --> 21:46.043
Yeah.

21:46.087 --> 21:47.567
[clears throat]

21:47.610 --> 21:48.785
All right, I get it,

21:48.829 --> 21:50.309
Stella, I do.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.875
I mean, everyone wants me
to talk with Uncle Liam,

21:51.919 --> 21:53.094
and it's not
like I haven't tried.

21:53.137 --> 21:55.444
[sighs]

21:55.488 --> 21:57.968
Stel...
Yes.

21:58.969 --> 22:01.058
I hope you know
how much it matters to me,

22:01.102 --> 22:02.973
what's going on in your world.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.671
I know.

22:04.714 --> 22:07.369
I just, I don't know how to say
what's up sometimes,

22:07.413 --> 22:10.416
but... spending time with
you actually helped.

22:10.459 --> 22:11.765
I mean,

22:11.808 --> 22:13.810
you made me feel better, and...

22:13.854 --> 22:15.725
all you did was lose.

22:15.769 --> 22:17.727
Yeah, it was close.[laughs]

22:17.771 --> 22:19.512
So...

22:19.555 --> 22:21.165
where do we go from here?

22:21.209 --> 22:23.254
Well, that was Bret
who just texted me.

22:23.298 --> 22:26.040
He said that he and Liam
are headed to Ranger HQ.

22:28.042 --> 22:30.392
I guess we'll start
with going there.

22:30.436 --> 22:31.785
Come on.

22:31.828 --> 22:33.308
JAMES:
Okay, folks,

22:33.352 --> 22:34.918
it all comes down to this.

22:34.962 --> 22:36.311
I live for these moments.
Let's go.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.704
I'm about to catch
this interception!

22:37.747 --> 22:39.662
No, no, no, no, no!Oh!

22:41.838 --> 22:44.624
Beautiful, beautiful.

22:44.667 --> 22:48.062
I'm not even gonna lie, bro,
that was a masterful play.

22:48.105 --> 22:49.672
[chuckles]
Whew!

22:49.716 --> 22:51.021
Yeah.

22:51.065 --> 22:52.371
Magic thumbs, huh?

22:53.415 --> 22:55.852
We gonna talk about Micki
or what, man?

22:57.463 --> 22:58.942
Uh...

22:58.986 --> 23:00.901
I don't know what to say.

23:00.944 --> 23:03.599
Right. So we're
on the same page.

23:06.646 --> 23:08.430
I, uh...

23:08.474 --> 23:11.781
I keep running
scenarios...

23:11.825 --> 23:14.001
what I could
have changed.

23:14.044 --> 23:16.220
Yeah. I recruited her,
you know.

23:16.264 --> 23:18.092
Yeah, I know.

23:20.007 --> 23:23.489
And I don't know,
I just keep coming back to...

23:23.532 --> 23:26.056
I think this is what she needed.

23:27.057 --> 23:28.450
She was taking care

23:28.494 --> 23:30.757
of herself, even though it hurt.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.236
Mm.
[phone ringing]

23:32.280 --> 23:33.847
Just a sec.

23:33.890 --> 23:35.544
Sorry, this is HQ.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.722
What took you so long?

23:40.723 --> 23:42.856
Got it. Thanks.

23:42.899 --> 23:46.686
We need to go on a beer run.

23:46.729 --> 23:50.211
[chuckles]
Cap, I got
plenty of beer.

23:50.254 --> 23:51.691

23:52.866 --> 23:54.433
We got to go.

You thought you had me, man.
I'm the comeback kid.

23:58.045 --> 24:00.526
Man, it was 14-nothing
at the half.

24:00.569 --> 24:02.832
Right, and I came back.
That's what I'm saying.

24:02.876 --> 24:06.227
Unbelievable, dude.It was unbelievable,

24:06.270 --> 24:08.316
now that you mention it.

24:13.713 --> 24:15.497
All right, what's the situation,
Cap?

24:15.541 --> 24:17.456
I ran the plates
on that car.

24:17.499 --> 24:20.067
You are being watched by one of
Serano's guys. Are you serious?

24:20.110 --> 24:23.505
I'm taking you to HQ.

24:23.549 --> 24:24.767
All right.

Whoa, y-you know this song?

25:03.284 --> 25:04.590
I didn't think
that was a thing.

25:04.633 --> 25:06.243
My mom used to
sing that to me.

25:06.287 --> 25:08.289
That makes sense.
Marv used--

25:08.332 --> 25:10.073
uh, your grandfather
used to sing it.

25:10.117 --> 25:12.336
Must be a family song.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.863
Can you say anything more
about that?

25:16.906 --> 25:18.821
I mean, I didn't
hear too much

25:18.865 --> 25:20.997
about y'all until we talked
about moving here.

25:21.041 --> 25:22.521
And once Austin came up,

25:22.564 --> 25:24.087
all I heard about
were the Walkers.

25:24.131 --> 25:26.394
Kind of made you guys
sound like

25:26.437 --> 25:28.135
super villains,
if I'm being real.

25:28.178 --> 25:30.137
Like, my dad hadn't
even met you guys,

25:30.180 --> 25:31.530
and he was amped to hate you.

25:31.573 --> 25:33.183
Yeah, what...
what was up with that?

25:33.227 --> 25:34.968
Well, his...

25:35.011 --> 25:36.578
his family was crap,

25:36.622 --> 25:39.146
from what I hear.

25:39.189 --> 25:41.496
It's part of why
they adopted me.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.585
They just wanted to do
right by someone else.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.892
Hmm. I didn't know that.

25:45.935 --> 25:48.111
I mean, I'm sure you guys
think my dad's a di-- well,

25:48.155 --> 25:51.071
a jerk or whatever.

25:51.114 --> 25:52.507
Um, look,

25:52.551 --> 25:55.510
it's just been a little
rough, moving.

25:55.554 --> 25:56.816
And when we got here,

25:56.859 --> 25:58.339
my parents had started
talking divorce.

26:00.994 --> 26:03.692
I can't imagine it's been easy.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.784
Colton...

26:08.828 --> 26:11.221
whatever has passed
between our families,

26:11.265 --> 26:14.877
it's clear that your parents
are good people,

26:14.921 --> 26:16.575

26:19.099 --> 26:20.317
Thank you, Mrs. Walker.

What do you think they want with
me? Nah, it's too early to tell.

26:26.715 --> 26:28.369
We're gonna figure it out,
though, don't worry about it.

26:28.412 --> 26:30.676
Hey, Captain James.
Good to see you. Uh, Bret Nam.

26:30.719 --> 26:32.025
I'm not sure if
you guys remember.

26:32.068 --> 26:33.548
Yeah, no, Bret,
yeah, of course.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.463
Liam's here to give
his statement.

26:36.812 --> 26:39.336
Uh, maybe in a little bit.

26:39.380 --> 26:40.773
Got it. Um...

26:40.816 --> 26:43.297
Serano's lawyers are
actually already here.

26:43.340 --> 26:45.908
Noted. Roger that.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.133
[engine shuts off]

26:54.482 --> 26:57.354
You look worried.

26:57.398 --> 26:58.747
Are you worried?
No.

26:58.791 --> 27:00.444
No, I'm n--
I'm, um...

27:00.488 --> 27:04.013
Funny enough,
I'm-I'm thinking about a time

27:04.057 --> 27:06.059
Liam and I got called
into the principal office.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.539
And what happened?

27:09.932 --> 27:12.152
Your uncle, uh...

27:12.195 --> 27:14.067
The kids at school,

27:14.110 --> 27:16.504
they-they put him
through the wringer.

27:16.547 --> 27:17.636
You know, he knew who he was,

27:17.679 --> 27:19.028
and not everyone loved that.

27:19.072 --> 27:20.595
So kids came after him.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.119
Uh...

27:23.163 --> 27:27.036
so, one day I...
picked a fight with him.

27:27.080 --> 27:30.387
A fight I was gonna make sure
he won. Know what I mean?

27:30.431 --> 27:32.651
You mean he beat you up.

27:32.694 --> 27:35.784
I mean, we-we beat
each other up.

27:35.828 --> 27:39.614
But that shut everyone else up.

27:41.007 --> 27:43.270
I know it probably
doesn't make any sense.

27:43.313 --> 27:46.621
Guys are weird.
Yeah. [clears throat]

27:46.665 --> 27:49.015
Okay, but why are you
thinking about it now?

27:51.670 --> 27:54.673
Because I think
I might be the person

27:54.716 --> 27:56.805
who taught him to do
something stupid

27:56.849 --> 27:58.981
in the name
of doing something right.

28:00.635 --> 28:03.072
You know who I hear has the best
coffee over here in Austin?

28:03.116 --> 28:04.639

So, uh...Yes, that is true.
By the way,

28:06.772 --> 28:09.252
do we still consider this
the holidays?

28:09.296 --> 28:12.734
Because I could go
for a peppermint Woo Woo.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.170
Okay, that's fantastic.
Let's go this way, guys.

28:14.214 --> 28:16.782

Yeah, I could.
William Walker?

28:16.825 --> 28:18.305

Okay, we'll let you guys know
when we're ready

28:19.480 --> 28:20.437
to make a statement, all right?

28:20.481 --> 28:21.874
Ah, no need to waste time.

28:21.917 --> 28:23.658
It's pretty cut and dry,
isn't it? You filed

28:23.702 --> 28:25.965
a false report--

a more official capacity.Can I actually ask you...

Let's......where you come off
being that smug.

28:32.014 --> 28:34.800

who you represent?

28:34.843 --> 28:37.803
We do. And do you know that
despite your leave of absence,

28:37.846 --> 28:39.674
you still work for
the District Attorney's Office?

28:39.718 --> 28:41.458
All the more reason that

28:41.502 --> 28:45.201
I want to bring
closure to this case.

28:45.245 --> 28:47.726
You're a joke, William Walker.

28:47.769 --> 28:49.466
Your outfit is a joke.Okay.

28:49.510 --> 28:50.816
No, no, no, no, no. You know weneeded that statement.

28:50.859 --> 28:52.339
Whoa, whoa, whoa.That's enough.

28:52.382 --> 28:53.862
That's enough. And this is
how you show up?

28:53.906 --> 28:54.776
We're not doing this.Just hold on a minute.

29:13.447 --> 29:14.840
[door shuts]

29:14.883 --> 29:16.145
Okay, first of all,

29:16.189 --> 29:17.451
I shouldn't have
to say any of this.

29:17.494 --> 29:19.583
Well, you don't have to.Apparently I do.

29:19.627 --> 29:21.194
I can't believe
you showed up here

29:21.237 --> 29:22.978
in the state that
you're in right now.

29:23.022 --> 29:24.980
You told me to come.I didn't think that

29:25.024 --> 29:27.330
Grizzly Adams was gonna go on
a bender before he showed up.

29:27.374 --> 29:29.289
It wasn't a bender,
Larry, okay?

29:29.332 --> 29:31.421
Look, this isn't great...

29:31.465 --> 29:33.510
You think?I just wanted

29:33.554 --> 29:35.948
so much to be right,
and to be

29:35.991 --> 29:40.300
so spectacularly wrong
is embarrassing.

29:40.343 --> 29:42.432
We're past that.Okay.

29:42.476 --> 29:45.871
Okay. And I'm thinking
maybe there's something more

29:45.914 --> 29:46.872
going on here.

29:46.915 --> 29:48.612
It just seems like...

29:48.656 --> 29:51.050
[sighs]

29:51.093 --> 29:52.878
It seems like ever since
you lost the D.A. race,

29:52.921 --> 29:54.096
you've been spinning.

29:54.140 --> 29:55.924
I lost D.A. to a man

29:55.968 --> 29:58.492
who killed
my sister-in-law, so...

29:58.535 --> 30:00.581
I know. I know.
I just need you to

30:00.624 --> 30:03.671
really think about
what it is that you want.

30:03.714 --> 30:05.151
Do you really want
to be A.D.A.?

30:06.892 --> 30:10.634
'Cause there are other places
you can do good, Liam.

30:10.678 --> 30:14.073
But it would be a damn shame
to lose you altogether.

30:14.116 --> 30:15.683
You hear me?

30:18.294 --> 30:19.469
I know.

30:20.862 --> 30:24.344
All right, listen.

30:24.387 --> 30:27.782
You stay the hell away
from Serano's lawyers

30:27.826 --> 30:29.218
until you sober up,
all right?

30:29.262 --> 30:30.219
Mm-hmm.

30:30.263 --> 30:32.134
Okay?Okay. Yes.

30:34.006 --> 30:37.270
Go home, man.
All right.

30:37.313 --> 30:38.706
STELLA:
I should have made Uncle Liam

30:38.749 --> 30:39.968
talk to me.

30:40.012 --> 30:41.491
I should have seen it coming.

30:41.535 --> 30:44.886
Hey, hey, that's
not your job.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.322
I swear, you got
more compassion

30:46.366 --> 30:48.803
than some folks
twice your age.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.805
I could tell you right now
there's been plenty of stuff

30:50.849 --> 30:52.241
that I should have seen coming,

30:52.285 --> 30:54.504
and I just stepped
right out of the way.

30:54.548 --> 30:56.202
Are you talking about Micki?

30:57.725 --> 30:59.858
I'm sorry, I just--

30:59.901 --> 31:01.381
I know my dad misses her.

31:01.424 --> 31:03.209
I do, too.

31:03.252 --> 31:07.126
She made me appreciate
the mental health benefits

31:07.169 --> 31:08.562
of target practice.

31:08.605 --> 31:10.912
[laughing]:
Of course she did.

31:10.956 --> 31:12.740
Ah.
I just--

31:12.783 --> 31:15.482
I wish there was something
I could do to fix it or...

31:15.525 --> 31:19.965
Hey, hey, you can't do anything.
And that's okay.

31:20.008 --> 31:23.838
You know, I think maybe

31:23.882 --> 31:25.579
you panicked earlier
because you feel like

31:25.622 --> 31:28.234
you don't have the right
to think about your own future.

31:28.277 --> 31:31.715
Something that's just for you.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.152
But you do.

31:44.728 --> 31:47.296
Hey.
Hey.

31:47.340 --> 31:49.124
I kind of made
a mess of things,

31:49.168 --> 31:51.387
and then you came all
this way to clean it up.

31:51.431 --> 31:52.736
Oh, please.
I came all this way

31:52.780 --> 31:54.782
for migas from Veracruz.

32:00.353 --> 32:02.659
What are we doing?

32:02.703 --> 32:05.924
I am not entirely
sure, Liam.

32:05.967 --> 32:10.276
You know, I miss you
every day.
Me, too.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.584
So, what are we doing?

32:14.628 --> 32:17.892
Well, I think that
we are waiting for me

32:17.936 --> 32:20.329
to be a person who's worth
making a promise to.

32:20.373 --> 32:23.811
And I'm waiting for you
to see that

32:23.854 --> 32:25.552
you are worth being
that person, okay?

32:25.595 --> 32:28.729
So we're on the same page
here, all right?

32:35.954 --> 32:37.433
Hey, Bret.

32:37.477 --> 32:39.696
Sorry. Yeah.
It's okay.

32:41.133 --> 32:43.439
Good to see you.
It's been a while.

32:43.483 --> 32:45.485
You mind if I
take over from here?Yeah, yeah.

32:45.528 --> 32:47.095
Of course, of course.

32:47.139 --> 32:49.228
Uh, you want me to take Stella
home? That'd be great.

32:50.403 --> 32:51.317
Thank you.

33:09.465 --> 33:10.727
Legend has it
that the troubles

33:10.771 --> 33:11.946
with the Walkers
and the Davidsons

33:11.990 --> 33:14.818
date back all the way
to the 1870s.

33:14.862 --> 33:16.081
What, for real?

33:16.124 --> 33:17.473
Oh, yeah.
Apparently,

33:17.517 --> 33:21.434
for real, but
believe it or not,

33:21.477 --> 33:23.784
Gale and I used to be friends.

33:23.827 --> 33:26.482
Which I think is missing
from the family history.

33:26.526 --> 33:27.831
No, it's-it's not missing.

33:27.875 --> 33:29.877
My gammy did mention that once.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.835
She also mentioned that you
and Gramps used to talk

33:31.879 --> 33:33.402
after you called off
the engagement.

33:33.446 --> 33:37.276
Well, I don't want you
to get any wrong ideas.

33:37.319 --> 33:38.712
He loved your gammy.

33:38.755 --> 33:40.670
Oh, she just said
you guys kept in touch.

33:42.542 --> 33:45.545
I'm sorry you never got
to meet him, Colton.

33:45.588 --> 33:47.460
I truly am.

33:47.503 --> 33:50.202
He was... human.

33:50.245 --> 33:52.421
It sounds like
a simple thing to say,

33:52.465 --> 33:56.208
but to be human...
is a gift.

33:59.950 --> 34:02.214
Aren't y'all supposed
to be working on a song?

34:02.257 --> 34:04.172
Yeah, it's been longer
than ten minutes.

34:04.216 --> 34:06.696
You know, you play your song,
and I'll make more nachos.

34:06.740 --> 34:08.394
Thank you.

about Grandpa Marv.

34:15.140 --> 34:17.272

Hey, um...

34:21.581 --> 34:23.017
don't say anything,
but I, um,

34:23.061 --> 34:25.933
I found something
at the burnt-out barn.

34:25.976 --> 34:27.413
Oh. What do you mean?

34:27.456 --> 34:30.677
I found a lantern
with my family's brand.

34:30.720 --> 34:33.549
Well, why would it be
in there?
