25:45.936 --> 25:48.528
So you enjoy that for me.

25:48.622 --> 25:50.606
- I definitely will.

25:50.624 --> 25:53.108
So are you, like,
looking forward to, like,

25:53.201 --> 25:55.886
Going and meeting
with my family?

25:56.038 --> 25:59.039
- Yeah, like, they were
super cool last night.

25:59.133 --> 26:01.450
- Yeah, I'm sure they went and
thought of plenty of questions

26:01.468 --> 26:03.468
Over the night.

26:03.621 --> 26:04.878

26:04.972 --> 26:07.289

26:07.382 --> 26:08.715

stamp of approval

26:08.809 --> 26:10.809
Is very important for me.

26:10.961 --> 26:13.979
- Yeah, so I think your meeting
will go smooth with my mom.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.815
Val, I mean, I feel like
she was, like, hesitant

26:16.967 --> 26:19.076
And had some reservations
about this whole process, but--

26:19.303 --> 26:20.578
- She expressed that
to me last night.

26:20.805 --> 26:21.804
- Yeah.

26:21.822 --> 26:24.306
- I thought he was crazy.

26:24.399 --> 26:26.417
No, this just came
out of nowhere.

26:26.644 --> 26:28.644
He woke up one day,
and he was getting married.

26:28.662 --> 26:33.757
This just seem, like, a little
over-the-top or extreme.

26:33.909 --> 26:35.818

like, all the way

26:35.836 --> 26:37.486

26:37.504 --> 26:39.488

27:39.383 --> 27:41.307
And still this morning.

27:41.402 --> 27:44.662
And we had a conversation last

27:47.500 --> 27:49.558

- Yeah, for me.

27:49.576 --> 27:51.059
- Yeah.

27:51.078 --> 27:53.153
I don't want to be
married to someone

27:53.172 --> 27:55.898
And we never see each other,
or he's tired

27:55.991 --> 27:56.823
And won't be able
to spend time with me.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.676
- Right.

27:58.827 --> 28:00.235
- I'm very supportive
and I'm very understanding,

28:00.254 --> 28:02.012
But I don't want to be
too supportive

28:02.239 --> 28:03.739
And too understanding
to where we're--

28:03.757 --> 28:04.923
- Right, he put you
on the back burner.

28:05.075 --> 28:07.242
- Yeah.

28:07.261 --> 28:09.244
- I'm going to tell you,
shaquille, one thing that just

28:09.263 --> 28:12.431
Is not settled for me
is making sure

28:12.583 --> 28:16.176
That you are intentional about
this marriage and kirsten.

28:16.195 --> 28:19.254
She was very intentional
about this process.

28:19.273 --> 28:20.531
She wanted to be married.

28:20.758 --> 28:22.607
She wants children.

28:22.760 --> 28:25.110
So I just want to make sure
that this is what you truly

28:25.262 --> 28:27.687
Believe was the means you
had to go through to find

28:27.781 --> 28:29.540
Your wife and to be married.

28:29.691 --> 28:32.025
And I just--
I'm not quite settled

28:32.119 --> 28:34.712
Right now with where I am.

28:34.863 --> 28:36.213
- I would agree.

28:36.440 --> 28:37.381
I didn't seek out
this opportunity.

28:37.532 --> 28:38.941
I saw the ads.

28:38.959 --> 28:40.792
I saw the billboards
and everything else.

28:40.945 --> 28:42.294
And I was like, no.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.054
But it kept appearing.

28:44.281 --> 28:45.614
Like, this is what--

28:45.632 --> 28:47.632
I think our lives is
already preordained.

28:47.727 --> 28:50.710
And for me, it's kind of like
it just fell in my lap.

28:50.730 --> 28:52.304
- It seems like everything
is coming to you.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.047
What if kirsten doesn't
come right to you?

28:54.066 --> 28:56.124
What if she doesn't warm up
right to you right away?

28:56.143 --> 28:57.793
What happens when y'all
get back from the honeymoon

28:57.811 --> 28:59.570
And she's super reserved?

28:59.721 --> 29:00.812
How do you plan on dealing
with that, if she doesn't

29:00.965 --> 29:02.481
Land right in your lap?

29:02.633 --> 29:04.483
- I think it's
all about balance.

29:04.635 --> 29:06.226
Like,
we're learning each other.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.636
Even though our families
mesh together,

29:07.654 --> 29:09.729
We may not mesh together.

29:09.749 --> 29:13.417
And we have to build
that bond between us.

29:13.568 --> 29:16.402
- Well, I'm hesitant because
we don't know if it's,

29:16.497 --> 29:18.571
I want to say the right things,

29:18.591 --> 29:20.424
I want to show up and be the
guy that I want kirsten to be,

29:20.651 --> 29:23.168
Instead of being the real
shaquille that we would

29:23.262 --> 29:25.245
Never know because,
you know, he's a stranger.

29:25.264 --> 29:29.157
- You have be very careful of
who you let into your heart.

29:29.251 --> 29:32.661
And so she will be
a little hesitant and slow.

29:32.679 --> 29:35.755
But as you be consistent,

29:35.775 --> 29:37.499
She's going to bloom
like a flower.

29:37.592 --> 29:39.926
But you're going
to be the driver in that,

29:39.945 --> 29:41.779
How you show up for her.

That's hungry for men.

30:29.644 --> 30:33.405
- [laughs] you know, I've had
a couple serious relationships.

30:33.499 --> 30:37.909
I have been a bit of a rambler
in my, you know, 20s.

30:38.062 --> 30:39.652

30:46.920 --> 30:50.330
And I think that's where I'm
at now and what makes me ready.

30:50.424 --> 30:52.165
I am looking for the real deal.

30:52.259 --> 30:54.500

dated a young lady

30:54.520 --> 30:57.020

30:57.247 --> 30:59.523
- I have mostly dated white
and latina women.

30:59.750 --> 31:01.507
- Mm-hmm.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.919
- I have gone out on dates
with black women.

31:04.012 --> 31:06.254
Honestly, I just haven't
had a lot of, uh,

32:40.942 --> 32:41.941

32:41.961 --> 32:43.518

32:43.537 --> 32:45.128

want to marry a stranger?

32:45.280 --> 32:46.871

me up initially.

32:47.024 --> 32:48.948

this would be, like,

- Good to see you.

Hey, kyle.

- How's it going?

34:26.807 --> 34:29.382
- How's this whole
experience been for you?

34:29.401 --> 34:31.234
- So many things have
gone through my mind

34:31.386 --> 34:33.628
In the past two weeks.

34:33.647 --> 34:36.464
Like, all the emotions
are just all over the place--

34:36.483 --> 34:40.302
The crazy negatives,
the super high expectations.

34:40.320 --> 34:42.061
Like, as soon as I saw gina,

34:42.155 --> 34:46.249
It's like it alleviated so much
of that anxiety that I had.

34:46.476 --> 34:48.993
- She's the whole package.
- She is. She's so cool.

34:49.088 --> 34:52.071
- Now that you've, you know,
been in a room with clint

34:52.091 --> 34:58.095
And probably seen him with,
certainly his jacket off,

34:58.246 --> 35:00.672
Do you think he's hot?
- I think he's hot, yeah.

35:00.766 --> 35:04.843
You know what's interesting--
so my, like, typical trait,

35:04.937 --> 35:07.938
Like, physical is,
like, tall, dark, handsome.

35:08.089 --> 35:09.606
I've just never been
someone that's been, like,

35:09.833 --> 35:11.757
Immediately attracted
to lighter hair,

35:11.777 --> 35:13.944
Like even blond, like,
or ginger hair.

35:14.171 --> 35:15.946
In my last relationship,
he was--like,

35:16.097 --> 35:18.431
He had blond hair
and a red beard.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.526
And it was like one of
those things that the physical

35:21.620 --> 35:23.011
Attraction--it wasn't someone
that I was immediately like,

35:23.029 --> 35:24.529
That's the one.
- Right.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.623
- But the personality,
like, everything made him

35:26.774 --> 35:27.866
So much more attractive.

35:28.018 --> 35:28.700
- It comes back
and grows on you.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.293
- Yeah.

35:30.520 --> 35:31.795
- What could be
a potential problem?

35:31.946 --> 35:34.038
I mean, you seem,
like, super chill.

35:34.133 --> 35:36.115
- Yeah.

35:36.135 --> 35:37.208
- But what could be a problem,
like, during this adventure

35:37.361 --> 35:39.970
That would maybe
make you shut down

35:40.197 --> 35:42.697
Or create any type
of problems where

35:42.716 --> 35:45.550
You'd be like, all right,
this was nice, but bye?

35:45.702 --> 35:47.811

and we're not trying

35:48.038 --> 35:50.129

other's viewpoints,

35:50.149 --> 35:51.723

you know, we're going

35:51.875 --> 35:54.542

some issues.

35:54.636 --> 35:56.060
There's going to
be some conflict.

35:56.213 --> 35:57.637
It's just natural.
- Yeah.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.972
- But it's how
you deal with it.

35:59.992 --> 36:02.550
And so we're going
to just talk it out.

36:02.569 --> 36:05.495

36:05.647 --> 36:07.647
<i> We'll know more</i>
<i> as time goes on.</i>

36:07.666 --> 36:09.166

36:09.317 --> 36:11.409
They're so similar,
they're so--

36:11.561 --> 36:15.230
I don't know, they really got
to sit down and figure out

36:15.248 --> 36:17.490
What they can learn
from each other

36:17.509 --> 36:19.825
And what the other one
can do better than the other.

36:19.845 --> 36:23.829
- What are some things that
I should be worried about?

36:23.849 --> 36:25.515
- She doesn't have a lot
of free time, right?

36:25.667 --> 36:28.018
So she dedicates
a lot of her time,

36:28.245 --> 36:31.354
You know, at her business,
making it grow bigger,

36:31.581 --> 36:33.673
And she does travel
quite frequently.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.417
So I mean, I guess
that would be my worry.

36:35.435 --> 36:37.861
Like, how are you guys
going to make that work

36:38.088 --> 36:40.697

your sailing,

36:40.848 --> 36:43.015

- yeah.

36:44.852 --> 36:46.536
- Have you guys
talked about, like, hey,

36:46.688 --> 36:48.538

to manage that and find

36:48.690 --> 36:50.022
