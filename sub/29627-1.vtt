00:51.250 --> 00:54.153
<i>Tex-52, wanna call it a day?</i>

00:55.186 --> 00:56.622
How's it looking by you?

00:57.856 --> 00:59.857
Dirt and rocks.

00:59.859 --> 01:03.860
Just like the last hour
and the hour before that.

01:03.862 --> 01:07.196
<i>All right, head out.
I'll be there in a few.</i>

01:07.198 --> 01:08.501
<i>Best part of the day.</i>

01:10.668 --> 01:12.104
Wait a minute.

01:14.305 --> 01:15.571
What is it?

01:15.573 --> 01:17.176
<i>Tracks at the mace.</i>

01:17.909 --> 01:19.776
One of ours?

01:19.778 --> 01:22.913
No, I don't think so.

01:22.915 --> 01:25.716
Storm drain dumps out on
the other side of the hill.

01:25.718 --> 01:27.353
<i>Let's link up over there.</i>

01:39.632 --> 01:42.231
865, two to three
sets of tracks

01:42.233 --> 01:45.401
moving into the storm drain
at Echo-31.

01:45.403 --> 01:47.106
Moving to pursue.

02:10.229 --> 02:14.298
865, tracks have split.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.370
Continuing pursuit one-half
mile north-east of Echo-31.

02:47.399 --> 02:50.299
865, requesting backup.

02:50.301 --> 02:52.668
Look like they
cut the road at the wash.

04:08.913 --> 04:11.316
Sully, you okay? Sully!

04:12.784 --> 04:15.352
Emergency response needed.

04:15.354 --> 04:17.923
One-half mile
northeast of Echo-31.

04:19.591 --> 04:21.494
One friendly down,
knife wound to the chest.

04:22.661 --> 04:23.762
One hostile in custody.

05:41.607 --> 05:43.173
They're taking him
back to base.

05:43.175 --> 05:45.509
Air lift him to UNC
from there.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.444
At least they
got him stable.

05:48.781 --> 05:50.115
You all right?

05:51.783 --> 05:52.951
Yeah.

05:54.586 --> 05:56.786
What's the story
on the girl?

05:56.788 --> 05:58.658
I'm sure it's nothing
you ain't already heard.

06:00.091 --> 06:02.425
Any documentation
on her?

06:02.427 --> 06:05.762
If she had, she wouldn't be trying
to squeeze through a storm drain.

06:05.764 --> 06:08.464
Says they were supposed to be
meeting up with her parents.

06:08.466 --> 06:10.933
They got by us
a couple of days ago.

06:10.935 --> 06:13.406
3-L took out her
older siblings.

06:15.107 --> 06:16.642
That explains a lot.

06:17.875 --> 06:20.043
What are we doing
with her, then?

06:20.045 --> 06:23.779
We'll hold her for the night,
but she'll be back in Mexico by morning.

06:23.781 --> 06:25.384
Think we should look
at the parents first?

06:26.819 --> 06:28.517
She's got nobody now.

06:28.519 --> 06:29.952
Ah, they're long gone.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.822
Especially with
a couple of days' head start.

06:31.824 --> 06:33.690
Probably deep inside
New Mexico.

06:33.692 --> 06:35.394
Hell, maybe even Texas.

06:37.528 --> 06:38.697
Sorry, Reyes.

06:39.798 --> 06:41.100
You know how
these things go.

06:41.867 --> 06:43.199
Go on home.

06:43.201 --> 06:45.137
There's nothing we can
do here now.

06:46.237 --> 06:47.774
All right, Chief.

07:31.516 --> 07:33.582
<i>The Clippers
will send Rodriguez to the mound.</i>

07:33.584 --> 07:36.118
<i>The three-game series
is even at one of these,</i>

07:36.120 --> 07:39.923
<i>after the Saints batted around twice
in the top of the ninth last night,</i>

07:39.925 --> 07:43.159
<i>scoring 12 runs to win
the game fifteen to four.</i>

07:43.161 --> 07:45.628
<i>In the West,
the levels of...</i>

07:45.630 --> 07:48.231
<i>Quick reminder
about next week's fun run.</i>

07:48.233 --> 07:50.199
<i>Attendance is mandatory.</i>

07:50.201 --> 07:52.269
<i>Check in
with your supervisor...</i>

07:52.271 --> 07:54.003
How's it out there?

07:54.005 --> 07:55.474
Prison 103.

07:56.807 --> 07:59.209
Fuck!

07:59.211 --> 08:02.114
Burke, you're back up.
You're covering for Reyes.

08:05.783 --> 08:07.250
- Chief?
- Morning.

08:07.252 --> 08:08.487
You got a minute?

08:09.687 --> 08:11.654
All day, apparently.

08:11.656 --> 08:13.289
Reyes, this is Ivan Sloane.

08:13.291 --> 08:15.161
He just transferred here
from Texas.

08:16.161 --> 08:18.762
You got three minutes.

08:18.764 --> 08:21.264
Ivan and his team specialize
in foreign and domestic

08:21.266 --> 08:23.033
counter-terrorism operations.

08:23.035 --> 08:24.868
Washington has cycled him
through here

08:24.870 --> 08:27.637
to assist us with a level
three classified threat.

08:27.639 --> 08:31.007
As of right now, their primary
focus in on the Chacal cartel.

08:31.009 --> 08:33.142
You know anything
about them?

08:33.144 --> 08:36.278
Nothing other than hearing something
about them making their way east.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.280
They had, but we
changing their game

08:38.283 --> 08:40.282
in the world of
narcotics trafficking.

08:40.284 --> 08:44.653
Washington's issued a state of
emergency for the entire Southwest.

08:44.655 --> 08:48.858
Ivan here's managed to push them out
of Texas, effectively cutting them off.

08:48.860 --> 08:53.265
He and his team have extensive experience
in these kind of containment things.

08:54.131 --> 08:55.967
Containment?

08:56.999 --> 08:59.201
Chacal cartel's brought
something new to the state.

08:59.203 --> 09:01.704
It's a nasty,
highly toxic substance.

09:01.706 --> 09:04.076
Rivals the effect of heroin
three times over.

09:06.177 --> 09:07.844
So what do you
need me for?

09:07.846 --> 09:09.746
Well, there's been
sightings of this shit

09:09.748 --> 09:11.948
as far as
the Texas-Louisiana border.

09:11.950 --> 09:14.883
Ivan and his team believe they've
seized all the supply of the product,

09:14.885 --> 09:16.319
pushed it out of Texas,

09:16.321 --> 09:18.722
through to New Mexico,
and now to right here.

09:18.724 --> 09:21.690
Now, we haven't had any
confirmed cases in Arizona yet,

09:21.692 --> 09:23.826
and by God,
I'd like to keep it that way.

09:23.828 --> 09:26.930
So they've asked that we put
our top guys onboard with Ivan.

09:26.932 --> 09:31.267
And seeing as how this will be the
cartel's last and probably hardest push,

09:31.269 --> 09:33.038
they could use
the extra hand.

09:35.039 --> 09:37.172
Something on your mind?

09:37.174 --> 09:39.611
Well, you think about it.
We can get back to it.

09:43.248 --> 09:45.585
What's a Mexican
doing in Border Patrol?

09:52.423 --> 09:54.757
What does that have
to do anything with it?

09:54.759 --> 09:56.258
The Chief gave me the rundown on
you, and that's all well and good.

09:56.260 --> 09:57.794
But if you wanna
roll with my guys,

09:57.796 --> 09:59.028
you're gonna
answer my questions.

09:59.030 --> 10:01.930
I didn't ask to roll
with anybody.

10:01.932 --> 10:03.800
Your family got
their citizenship,

10:03.802 --> 10:05.267
came over here legal.
That's great.

10:05.269 --> 10:08.206
But, land of opportunity,
and you chose this path?

10:09.140 --> 10:10.241
Why?

10:12.744 --> 10:16.079
You're right. My father did
get us our citizenship.

10:16.081 --> 10:19.715
But not before getting denied
twice on a 22 month waiting period.

10:19.717 --> 10:21.818
He fought to get us here.

10:21.820 --> 10:23.853
I wanted to do something
to contribute to a place

10:23.855 --> 10:26.256
he knew was gonna
give us a better way of life.

10:26.258 --> 10:28.992
I'm sorry my career choice
disappoints you.

10:28.994 --> 10:32.027
Not all of us come here to paint
your houses and build your fences.

10:32.029 --> 10:34.196
Reyes, nobody can be
assigned to this.

10:34.198 --> 10:36.232
You got to give it
a yes or a no.

10:36.234 --> 10:39.802
I'm also told you wanna work
your way up to NSA level someday.

10:39.804 --> 10:41.873
One word from me
and they'll come knocking.

10:43.140 --> 10:44.440
But if he doesn't
wanna do it,

10:44.442 --> 10:46.376
you can just throw
somebody else at me.

10:46.378 --> 10:47.947
We'll start again tomorrow.

10:49.346 --> 10:51.016
What did you say
you're here for again?

10:55.287 --> 10:58.121
We're small men teams
going after big targets.

10:58.123 --> 11:00.190
The reason this is such
a tier-one issue

11:00.192 --> 11:03.792
is because it produces a flesh-eating
virus, and viruses spread.

11:03.794 --> 11:06.061
This is still an entirely
foreign substance,

11:06.063 --> 11:09.065
and its cause of contraction,
other than direct use,

11:09.067 --> 11:10.269
s currently unknown.

11:12.370 --> 11:15.338
Seems like something we
can handle on our own.

11:15.340 --> 11:18.407
I seized over 600,000
pounds of narcotics,

11:18.409 --> 11:23.313
and shut down the largest human
trafficking circle Brazil has ever seen.

11:23.315 --> 11:26.148
I'm here to make sure that this nasty
shit doesn't get into our country.

11:26.150 --> 11:28.852
It rips the flesh
right off the bone.

11:28.854 --> 11:32.522
To the junkie, it's just the next
high, and they'll pay dearly for it.

11:32.524 --> 11:35.425
Poor bastards don't know the
difference until it's too late.

11:35.427 --> 11:37.493
And they'll make
a profit on it

11:37.495 --> 11:40.396
while the rest of the country
kills itself from the inside out.

11:40.398 --> 11:43.199
If it gets out and goes
widespread, your chief is right.

11:43.201 --> 11:46.368
A lot of innocent families try to
get into the country the right way.

11:46.370 --> 11:47.903
But they end up
getting denied,

11:47.905 --> 11:49.805
because they're already
infected by it.

11:49.807 --> 11:52.074
You'd be helping
to put a stop to that.

11:52.076 --> 11:55.044
But if he wants to stay where
he's at, it makes no difference to me.

11:55.046 --> 11:57.383
We'll just run down the list
until we find someone that sticks.

12:30.248 --> 12:32.084
You the new dick?

12:33.350 --> 12:34.550
What?

12:34.552 --> 12:36.286
Our new guy.

12:36.288 --> 12:37.423
Yeah. Reyes.

12:48.866 --> 12:51.401
So, you know the deal
for tonight?

12:51.403 --> 12:53.402
Ivan will fill us in.

12:53.404 --> 12:55.371
Try to keep up.

12:55.373 --> 12:56.509
Don't shoot any of us.

12:58.543 --> 13:00.243
And take that shit off.

13:00.245 --> 13:01.877
Keep your civvies on.

13:01.879 --> 13:03.115
Plate on your chest.

13:15.927 --> 13:19.863
All right. Neighbors called in on
suspicion of sheltering some undocs.

13:19.865 --> 13:22.065
We don't have a head count.
Could be two, maybe twenty.

13:22.067 --> 13:24.199
Hostile?
Weapons on sight?

13:24.201 --> 13:25.969
Also unknown.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.369
Neighbors say they only
leave the property after dark.

13:27.371 --> 13:29.071
So, stay sharp.

13:29.073 --> 13:31.373
Rules of engagement
are weapons-free.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.877
Is that necessary?

13:35.013 --> 13:38.113
Reyes, everyone.
Everyone, Reyes.

13:38.115 --> 13:40.249
Make no mistake.
These people are enemies of the state

13:40.251 --> 13:41.884
and should be
treated as such.

13:41.886 --> 13:43.254
All right?
Let's hit it.

13:47.259 --> 13:50.059
Reyes, your bean speak is
probably the strongest.

13:50.061 --> 13:51.297
So you're first
to the door.

14:33.705 --> 14:36.238
Don't fuck this up.
Cover yourself.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.043
You don't want these
fuckers seeing your face.

14:45.951 --> 14:47.316
Get on the fucking ground.

14:49.421 --> 14:50.522
Down!

14:52.389 --> 14:53.558
We're good!

14:55.393 --> 14:56.928
Don't fucking move!

15:04.068 --> 15:05.435
Is anyone else
here with you?

15:05.437 --> 15:07.005
- It's all clear.
- Copy.

15:09.740 --> 15:11.175
Make yourself useful.

15:17.481 --> 15:19.348
Yes.

15:19.350 --> 15:20.619
What are you
doing here?

15:22.019 --> 15:23.585
I'm here to work.

15:23.587 --> 15:25.488
That's all.

15:25.490 --> 15:27.025
I heard that one before.

15:36.533 --> 15:38.233
I have documentation.

15:38.235 --> 15:39.435
<i>Documentos.</i>
I'll show you.

15:39.437 --> 15:40.538
Don't move.

15:42.506 --> 15:43.675
Where is it you work?

15:45.210 --> 15:47.377
The man that
owns the house

15:47.379 --> 15:49.579
has small business.
Okay?

15:49.581 --> 15:53.516
I work there. He pay me very
little, but he let me stay here.

15:53.518 --> 15:55.053
Until I have money
for my own house.

15:55.552 --> 15:56.554
Okay?

15:58.389 --> 15:59.789
Please.

15:59.791 --> 16:01.593
I'll show you
my <i>documentos.</i>

16:24.481 --> 16:26.049
Follow this man
right here.

16:26.051 --> 16:27.449
We just have a few
papers for you to sign,

16:27.451 --> 16:29.120
and then we'll let you
get back to your evening.

16:29.687 --> 16:31.090
Reyes.

16:33.357 --> 16:34.425
Go.

17:12.163 --> 17:13.598
I think somebody's
here for you.

17:24.642 --> 17:26.608
Good evening, fellas.

17:26.611 --> 17:29.411
I'm taking that one in overnight,
but the place is yours.

17:29.413 --> 17:31.247
What's the story with him?

17:31.249 --> 17:33.115
His papers check out.
He works for the house owner.

17:33.117 --> 17:35.151
- Where's he?
- I don't know.

17:35.153 --> 17:36.521
So, maybe you should
run his papers.

17:37.788 --> 17:39.755
All right, I'll be in and out.

17:39.757 --> 17:41.360
Copy that.

17:43.528 --> 17:45.428
Hey.

17:45.430 --> 17:47.596
What are they
doing here?

17:47.598 --> 17:49.632
All calls originating from neighborhoods
like this go to us and the PD,

17:49.634 --> 17:52.134
but they still
have jurisdiction.

17:52.136 --> 17:53.538
It's all good though.
I told 'em my deal.

18:09.854 --> 18:11.289
- Yeah.
- Hey.

18:13.758 --> 18:15.727
I need you to get him
out of the vehicle.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.535
Step out.

18:24.903 --> 18:26.238
Get out of here now.

18:27.438 --> 18:29.305
Hands behind your back.

18:29.307 --> 18:30.706
- What?
- Do not move.

18:30.708 --> 18:32.507
Hey, hey.
What's happening?

18:32.509 --> 18:34.813
Found an unregistered weapon
and narcotics under the bed.

18:38.383 --> 18:39.849
That's not mine.

18:39.851 --> 18:41.183
I checked the bed.

18:41.185 --> 18:42.485
And look what
you missed.

18:42.487 --> 18:43.822
Wait. No, no, no, no.

18:46.324 --> 18:48.391
You can't do this.
You can't do this to me.

18:48.393 --> 18:50.559
I've done nothing.
Fuck you!

18:50.561 --> 18:51.896
Fuck you, <i>puto.</i>

19:11.215 --> 19:13.516
Where are they
taking him?

19:13.518 --> 19:15.621
He'll spend the night in county,
then headed back to Mexico.

19:18.222 --> 19:19.488
What about his papers?

19:19.490 --> 19:20.957
You know how long
it took him to get those?

19:20.959 --> 19:23.292
Probably less
than an hour. They're fake.

19:23.294 --> 19:24.960
- What?
- Fake, forced, void.

19:24.962 --> 19:26.362
Whatever you wanna call it.

19:26.364 --> 19:27.963
And you know that
for sure?

19:27.965 --> 19:31.299
I wouldn't be in
my position if I wasn't.

19:31.301 --> 19:33.302
Cartel boys have been
swapping tactics lately.

19:33.304 --> 19:36.005
Sending innocent civvies
as scouts.

19:36.007 --> 19:38.744
This right here proves they can
provide passable documentation.

19:45.415 --> 19:46.782
I'd like to see
his papers.

19:46.784 --> 19:49.251
What?

19:49.253 --> 19:50.385
His papers.
Can I see them?

19:50.387 --> 19:51.853
No can do.

19:51.855 --> 19:53.458
PD already has them
in evidence.

19:54.358 --> 19:57.860
Listen, Reyes.

19:57.862 --> 20:01.764
You're gonna have to pick up on some
things if you wanna stick around.

20:01.766 --> 20:04.834
You wanna get the bad guys?
They wanna get you more.

20:04.836 --> 20:07.702
Think about this as
a learning experience.

20:07.704 --> 20:10.541
You should just soak up how desperate
they are to keep their teeth dug into us.

20:11.442 --> 20:12.574
Get that, Ivan.

20:12.576 --> 20:14.043
What about the homeowner?

20:14.045 --> 20:15.544
There's a chance that stuff
could have been his.

20:15.546 --> 20:17.947
Not likely.

20:17.949 --> 20:19.518
But PD will be
following up with him.

20:22.787 --> 20:24.386
I know how you feel
about these people,

20:24.388 --> 20:25.988
and I understand why.

20:25.990 --> 20:28.559
But if you let your emotions
rule your trigger finger,

20:29.760 --> 20:31.363
they will take
advantage of you.

21:03.327 --> 21:05.297
We're going out again soon.
You ready to roll?

21:06.330 --> 21:07.365
Yeah.

21:08.732 --> 21:10.699
Yeah, listen, um...

21:10.701 --> 21:12.971
Sorry that your first day out
with us had to be like that.

21:14.338 --> 21:15.770
You care about these people.

21:15.772 --> 21:17.907
I'm nobody to judge that.

21:17.909 --> 21:20.875
Unfortunately, days like that
are the nature of the beast.

21:20.877 --> 21:23.447
You got to learn to expect that
not everybody is what they seem.

21:24.882 --> 21:27.115
I know.

21:27.117 --> 21:28.753
It's just the look
in his eyes, you know.

21:29.886 --> 21:31.453
You think he's innocent?

21:31.455 --> 21:33.756
You got to keep that inside,
lock it away.

21:33.758 --> 21:36.558
These monsters will take everything
from you that they can possibly get,

21:36.560 --> 21:38.596
regardless of the fact that
you share a skin tone.

21:39.931 --> 21:41.963
They're not monsters.

21:41.965 --> 21:44.635
But when you put that uniform
on, you became one of them.

21:47.137 --> 21:49.671
You father was a proud citizen
of this country, I'm sure.

21:49.673 --> 21:51.940
I know that you are, too.

21:51.942 --> 21:54.413
You just gotta be willing to uphold
that, whatever the cost.

21:56.646 --> 21:57.816
See you outside, yes?

21:58.782 --> 22:00.115
Yeah.

22:00.117 --> 22:01.419
All right.

22:34.786 --> 22:36.084
Your first cookout?

22:36.086 --> 22:38.053
My what?

22:38.055 --> 22:39.557
You'll adjust.

22:41.925 --> 22:43.726
Check the size.
I wager they drove off

22:43.728 --> 22:45.096
at three, four mil in profit.

22:46.631 --> 22:47.966
Took every cent with 'em.

22:48.965 --> 22:50.368
All of it untaxed.

22:50.801 --> 22:52.036
No, sir.

22:53.604 --> 22:54.673
Not all of it.

22:59.676 --> 23:01.811
- That's a good one.
- Mmm-hmm.

23:01.813 --> 23:03.749
Clear and not
a cloud in sight.

23:10.488 --> 23:11.490
Hey!

23:14.959 --> 23:16.394
What the hell is that?

23:17.028 --> 23:19.562
Easy there, spick.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.930
- Eyes on the line.
- Fuck you.

23:21.932 --> 23:23.798
I saw what the hell
you did.

23:23.800 --> 23:24.566
- All right, everyone. Dial it down.
- Oh, yeah?

23:24.568 --> 23:26.802
We got a problem?

23:26.804 --> 23:29.103
You're gonna have a fucking
problem when Morris finds out about this.

23:29.105 --> 23:30.773
That's gonna be real hard to do when the
next bus back to red, white and green

23:30.775 --> 23:32.507
is dragging your brown,
lifeless ass behind it.

23:32.509 --> 23:33.909
- The fuck you talking about, bitch?
- Enough!

23:33.911 --> 23:34.913
Take a walk.

23:35.846 --> 23:37.081
Walk.

23:41.486 --> 23:42.954
And you, come with me.

23:52.963 --> 23:55.096
Now let's talk about
what you thought you saw

23:55.098 --> 23:57.932
before you do something stupid like
dragging your captain into this.

23:57.934 --> 23:59.934
There's nothing
to talk about.

23:59.936 --> 24:02.705
A member of whatever
branch of the U.S. Government

24:02.707 --> 24:04.509
has an illegal
substance in his system,

24:05.076 --> 24:07.075
while on duty.

24:07.077 --> 24:08.878
This will be
reported to Morris.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.778
Well, I'd think long and
hard before doing that.

24:10.780 --> 24:12.216
Especially when
you have no proof.

24:14.151 --> 24:15.250
I watched him do it.

24:15.252 --> 24:16.518
Maybe he
watched you do it.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.286
Maybe we all did.

24:18.288 --> 24:20.625
And you don't think they could
find their way around a piss test?

24:22.259 --> 24:23.825
What the hell is this?

24:23.827 --> 24:26.562
This is whatever
you want it to be.

24:26.564 --> 24:28.296
It can be your ticket
upstairs with the big boys,

24:28.298 --> 24:29.832
or the end of
your time at BP.

24:29.834 --> 24:31.199
But what it won't be
is finger pointing,

24:31.201 --> 24:33.003
because you're a little
shy in the sheets.

24:34.838 --> 24:37.773
You run a different kind of
show around here, and I get it.

24:37.775 --> 24:40.042
Nothing makes sense
to you now.

24:40.044 --> 24:42.745
But I can assure you that all that was
was a field op at the top of his game

24:42.747 --> 24:44.613
testing the purity
of our friend's product.

24:44.615 --> 24:45.980
Bullshit.

24:45.982 --> 24:48.284
We got people for
that kind of thing.

24:48.286 --> 24:50.084
You're not gonna dangle
a pay raise in front of me

24:50.086 --> 24:51.953
and expect to pull the shades
over my eyes that easily.

24:51.955 --> 24:54.023
Sometimes, to get into
the mind of a monster,

24:54.025 --> 24:55.894
you have to dine
at the same table.

24:57.127 --> 24:58.661
Now, you don't
have to be here.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.796
I told you that from
the very beginning.

25:00.798 --> 25:02.197
So suck it up, gut it up
until we're done

25:02.199 --> 25:04.099
and get my recommendation,
or jump ship.

25:04.101 --> 25:05.637
But don't threaten me.

25:07.738 --> 25:10.241
I guarantee you that'll be
the last mistake you make.

25:12.742 --> 25:13.944
Come on.

25:16.012 --> 25:17.182
Done here.

26:06.797 --> 26:08.930
Chief, you got a minute?

26:08.932 --> 26:12.934
Sure. I'd like to hear
about that cook site anyway.

26:12.936 --> 26:16.005
Everything run smooth,
I take it?

26:16.007 --> 26:18.373
That's what I wanted to
talk to you about, actually.

26:18.375 --> 26:20.843
Ivan and those guys
are the best, aren't they?

26:20.845 --> 26:22.777
We're lucky to have 'em.

26:22.779 --> 26:24.313
Where exactly are they
from, Chief?

26:24.315 --> 26:26.114
I know they spent
some time in Texas.

26:26.116 --> 26:28.249
But beyond that,
what?

26:28.251 --> 26:30.719
Are we looking at DOD? CIA?

26:30.721 --> 26:32.388
Something even
above that?

26:32.390 --> 26:35.923
May I ask why you're
suddenly so interested?

26:35.925 --> 26:39.428
I just wanna know what
we're dealing with, Sir.

26:39.430 --> 26:43.065
Well, to be perfectly honest with
you, your guess is good as mine.

26:43.067 --> 26:45.933
They're here to help with
the never-ending struggle.

26:45.935 --> 26:48.703
And for that reason alone,
I don't ask that question.

26:48.705 --> 26:50.207
None of
the station chiefs do.

26:53.443 --> 26:55.443
I think it's in our best
interest if we ask them to leave

26:55.445 --> 26:56.647
and let us handle this.

26:58.082 --> 27:00.982
What the hell are you
talking about, Reyes?

27:00.984 --> 27:04.053
This is a shot any one of your
colleagues would love to have.

27:04.055 --> 27:07.088
And it's an opportunity for
you to rock it up the ladder.

27:07.090 --> 27:09.091
Beyond that, it's Washington

27:09.093 --> 27:12.061
finally admitting that we have
a serious issue down here.

27:12.063 --> 27:14.830
They've listened and
now they've answered.

27:14.832 --> 27:18.267
Now, unless Ivan's done something that
would warrant me calling up the chain,

27:18.269 --> 27:20.001
I've got no power over him.

27:20.003 --> 27:21.905
They stay
until the job's done.

27:24.942 --> 27:26.076
Reyes?

27:27.178 --> 27:28.844
No, nothing, Sir.

27:28.846 --> 27:31.013
They just work
a little differently.

27:31.015 --> 27:32.715
I'm not sure
it's where I want to be.

27:32.717 --> 27:34.949
You're an outsider to 'em.

27:34.951 --> 27:37.719
We're all on the same team
and they know that.

27:37.721 --> 27:39.488
You could learn a lot
from Ivan.

27:39.490 --> 27:42.391
Now, if you want off the
assignment, I can't make you stay.

27:42.393 --> 27:44.727
But I'd like to
see you finish.

27:44.729 --> 27:46.862
They could use
a guy like you.

27:46.864 --> 27:48.930
Thank you, Chief.

27:48.932 --> 27:50.734
You got a visitor,
by the way.

28:15.125 --> 28:16.525
Back from the dead.

28:16.527 --> 28:19.428
You can't get rid of me
that easy.

28:19.430 --> 28:21.162
So, what's it
looking like, man?

28:21.164 --> 28:22.998
That fucker missed my hart
by a fraction of an inch.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.099
Can you believe that?

28:24.101 --> 28:25.234
What heart?

28:26.871 --> 28:29.138
- Well, you look good.
- Oh.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.038
It hurts to put
a shirt on.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.208
But sitting on my ass at home?
That's the real killer.

28:33.210 --> 28:34.479
I hear that, man.

28:35.846 --> 28:36.847
Listen...

28:38.281 --> 28:39.884
I fucked up out there.

28:41.018 --> 28:42.817
I didn't have your back.

28:42.819 --> 28:44.920
It may be one of those
backs that wasn't for you.

28:44.922 --> 28:46.854
You saved my ass.

28:46.856 --> 28:48.556
We are all ready
for you to be back.

28:48.558 --> 28:50.327
I should be cleared for light
duty in a couple of days.

28:53.163 --> 28:55.432
They definitely don't look
like they're from around here.

28:56.567 --> 28:58.267
Transfers from Texas.

28:58.269 --> 29:00.001
I'll tell you
about that later.

29:00.003 --> 29:01.338
We're over-staffed
the way it is.

29:02.573 --> 29:04.873
So why don't you
come by tomorrow?

29:04.875 --> 29:07.042
Jen's having a get-together,
and Haley keeps bugging me about you.

29:07.044 --> 29:08.446
- Oh, man. Wouldn't miss it.
- All right.

30:55.551 --> 30:57.288
You still have a few years
by my count.

31:00.089 --> 31:01.225
Are you gonna
tell on me?

31:02.660 --> 31:04.359
Couldn't look
the other way.

31:04.361 --> 31:07.028
I need something
to sway my decision.

31:07.030 --> 31:08.497
That beer would be
a good start.

31:08.499 --> 31:10.201
Your gut says otherwise.

31:12.336 --> 31:14.001
How is summer school
treating you?

31:14.003 --> 31:15.403
Six hours a day,

31:15.405 --> 31:17.940
on top of dad giving me
the daily guilt trip

31:17.942 --> 31:19.941
about having to cancel
our vacation.

31:19.943 --> 31:22.276
Wow. Your dad wasn't
the best in school either,

31:22.278 --> 31:24.613
but you didn't
hear that from me.

31:24.615 --> 31:26.213
Try to hit the range
this weekend,

31:26.215 --> 31:27.949
if you wanna get
schooled again.

31:27.951 --> 31:30.986
As soon as you can convince
him to take me off the chain.

31:30.988 --> 31:33.488
You've been pretty good.
I'll see what I can do.

31:33.490 --> 31:36.158
I just have to get through senior
year, and I'm gone.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.559
Well, whenever you decide
to break that news to him,

31:38.561 --> 31:39.563
take it easy.

31:40.497 --> 31:41.566
He's been through
a lot.

31:42.499 --> 31:44.001
He cares about you.

31:46.670 --> 31:48.038
Still gonna need that.

31:51.642 --> 31:52.677
There he is.

31:55.112 --> 31:56.678
She's getting tall.

31:56.680 --> 31:57.981
I know.

31:58.648 --> 32:00.716
It's funny.

32:00.718 --> 32:03.751
Sometimes it seems like she'd
rather live with you than with us.

32:03.753 --> 32:05.519
When are you gonna have
some of your own?

32:05.521 --> 32:08.356
Ha! He'd have to
get a date first.

32:08.358 --> 32:11.258
That hole in your chest hasn't
affected your ability to cut me down.

32:11.260 --> 32:13.461
Don't pay any
attention to him.

32:13.463 --> 32:17.665
That's just him covering up that he
actually missed you the other night.

32:17.667 --> 32:20.270
- Is that right?
- I'm on a lot of medication.

32:22.271 --> 32:24.006
Mind if I steal him
for a minute, Jen?

32:24.008 --> 32:25.009
Sure.

32:28.244 --> 32:30.511
It's good to see everything's solid
on the homefront with you, man.

32:30.513 --> 32:32.279
Yeah, I can't complain.

32:32.281 --> 32:34.351
How about you?
Morris said you're running solo.

32:35.118 --> 32:36.183
Not quite.

32:36.185 --> 32:37.352
The transfers from Texas.

32:37.354 --> 32:38.489
Are you training them
or what?

32:39.789 --> 32:42.257
No.

32:42.259 --> 32:44.328
Something's going on that needs
to stay between us right now.

32:45.229 --> 32:46.761
Can't tell anyone.

32:46.763 --> 32:49.197
Not even Jen.

32:49.199 --> 32:52.267
Chacal hit something new at us and it
spread through the Southwest already.

32:52.269 --> 32:54.005
Is it on the
methamphetamine shelf?

32:55.405 --> 32:57.139
I don't know.

32:57.141 --> 32:59.708
But it got Washington to
issue a state of emergency.

32:59.710 --> 33:01.509
Those guys
you saw yesterday?

33:01.511 --> 33:03.545
They're leading a containment
effort against it.

33:03.547 --> 33:05.247
Damn.

33:05.249 --> 33:07.215
Morris say where
they're operating out of?

33:07.217 --> 33:08.482
Feds maybe?

33:08.484 --> 33:10.451
I've been asking that
for two days.

33:10.453 --> 33:12.319
So far,
no straight answer.

33:12.321 --> 33:15.157
But this definitely has
"cartel" stamped all over it.

33:15.159 --> 33:16.824
I'd give anything
to go out with those guys.

33:16.826 --> 33:18.528
See some real shit.

33:20.463 --> 33:22.530
You know I can't ask that
from you or Jen.

33:22.532 --> 33:23.700
Not after what happened.

33:24.768 --> 33:26.668
I let you down once.

33:26.670 --> 33:29.371
I can't let that
happen again.

33:29.373 --> 33:31.440
Think doc will be good with
you on your feet tomorrow?

33:31.442 --> 33:33.107
Fuck if I care.

33:33.109 --> 33:35.045
Most action I've seen
is walking to the mailbox.

33:36.680 --> 33:38.180
I hear you, man.

33:38.182 --> 33:39.448
How's that shoulder?

33:39.450 --> 33:40.451
It's all right.
It'll be good.

33:45.655 --> 33:47.488
<i>We're
also learning this morning</i>

33:47.490 --> 33:49.591
<i>more about the killing
of a U.S. Border Patrol agent</i>

33:49.593 --> 33:52.160
<i>along the Mexico-Arizona
border Tuesday.</i>

33:52.162 --> 33:53.694
<i>Josh, good morning to you.</i>

33:53.696 --> 33:56.163
<i>This is a very famous
drug-trafficking corridor.</i>

33:56.165 --> 33:58.866
<i>One of the most famous,
in fact, of the entire border.</i>

33:58.868 --> 34:02.203
<i>And for that reason, investigators
suspect what happened to Agent Ivy</i>

34:02.205 --> 34:05.507
<i>could be connected
to narco-trafficking.</i>

34:05.509 --> 34:07.843
<i>This morning,
these hills in Nago, Arizona,</i>

34:07.845 --> 34:10.777
<i>just three miles
from the U.S.-Mexico border,</i>

34:10.780 --> 34:12.581
<i>remain a crime scene.</i>

34:12.583 --> 34:14.583
<i>Agent Ivy died
in the line of duty.</i>

34:14.585 --> 34:18.518
<i>Protecting our nation against
those who threaten our way of life.</i>

34:18.521 --> 34:20.722
<i>This morning
is a search for his killer.</i>

34:20.724 --> 34:24.362
<i>Border Patrol agents are remembering
the life of one of their own.</i>

36:27.851 --> 36:29.820
Quite a haul.
Where did you pick these guys up from?

36:43.266 --> 36:45.769
<i>Gray
sedan, heading east down on 155.</i>

36:46.637 --> 36:48.603
<i>One mile out.</i>

36:53.876 --> 36:56.447
Hey, uh, what's
that plate again?

36:58.614 --> 37:00.514
All right.

37:00.516 --> 37:01.652
Last name?

37:03.820 --> 37:05.222
Got him.

37:14.563 --> 37:16.000
Where the fuck
are you going?

37:39.088 --> 37:41.558
That piece of paper your
daddy got you don't mean shit.

37:43.726 --> 37:44.961
You wanna wear my stripes?

37:46.463 --> 37:47.598
Show me why.

37:52.402 --> 37:53.503
Stay here.

38:46.389 --> 38:48.523
Ask for their papers.

40:15.945 --> 40:17.010
What's the hold up?

40:22.719 --> 40:24.121
Sir, may I see
your papers?

40:29.960 --> 40:31.429
Get him out of here!

40:44.007 --> 40:45.773
What are you doing?

40:45.775 --> 40:46.907
They were fake.

40:46.909 --> 40:48.909
And how the hell
do you know that?

40:48.911 --> 40:51.147
You practically made that kid
shit herself into not talking.

41:44.800 --> 41:46.166
Sure this is cool?

41:46.168 --> 41:48.869
Fresh cook site,
tents in the area.

41:48.871 --> 41:50.905
If we run into the heat,

41:50.907 --> 41:52.874
they're gonna have the extra
hand, whether they want it or not.

41:52.876 --> 41:55.275
If there's something you're not telling
me, now's the time.

41:55.277 --> 41:56.880
These guys work
a little differently.

42:00.050 --> 42:01.615
Who's this?

42:01.617 --> 42:03.617
This is Sully.
He just got back from med leave.

42:03.619 --> 42:05.086
And what's he
doing here?

42:05.088 --> 42:06.588
Active site.

42:06.590 --> 42:07.825
We can use an extra
gun with us.

42:09.592 --> 42:11.261
Made that decision
on your own, huh?

42:14.630 --> 42:16.363
These are my guys.

42:16.365 --> 42:18.833
And their lives are my
responsibility, not yours.

42:18.835 --> 42:21.170
You don't get to decide who
comes into the circle. I do.

42:22.072 --> 42:23.137
Hostile cook site,

42:23.139 --> 42:24.905
or a fucking game
of hopscotch,

42:24.907 --> 42:26.907
I'm not about to let somebody
I don't know tag along.

42:26.909 --> 42:28.675
I'm sorry he told you one thing
and I'm telling you another,

42:28.677 --> 42:30.047
but there's no room
for you here.

42:32.081 --> 42:33.217
Let's go.

42:35.217 --> 42:37.318
He stays, I stay.

42:37.320 --> 42:39.720
You wanna go in
shorthanded, that's fine.

42:39.722 --> 42:41.824
I don't have to be the Fed
to know when to call in help.

42:44.927 --> 42:46.827
All right.

42:46.829 --> 42:47.998
But he's your baggage.

43:48.023 --> 43:51.958
<i>We got a white
male, black tank top, black pants.</i>

43:51.960 --> 43:54.330
<i>Wandering around two miles
east off the road.</i>

44:14.918 --> 44:17.284
How you doing today?

44:17.286 --> 44:19.420
Can't complain
other than this heat.

44:19.422 --> 44:22.389
The chopper spotted you
wandering around out here.

44:22.391 --> 44:24.291
You mind telling me what
you're doing out here?

44:24.293 --> 44:26.293
I'm just coming
from San Lucas.

44:26.295 --> 44:28.398
Me and my wife doing the
resort thing for a week.

44:29.431 --> 44:30.898
Your wife?

44:30.900 --> 44:32.833
Yeah, she forgot
something back home,

44:32.835 --> 44:34.936
so I just came
to go get it.

44:34.938 --> 44:36.938
And you were looking for it
out there?

44:36.940 --> 44:38.840
No, I didn't have
a signal,

44:38.842 --> 44:41.809
so I was just hoping
to get a bar or two.

44:41.811 --> 44:44.144
Well, it's a hell of a drive.
Where you heading to?

44:44.146 --> 44:46.447
Uh, we live just
in Sahuarita.

44:46.449 --> 44:49.052
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you what
you're doing all the way over here then.

44:50.152 --> 44:51.485
Living in Sahuarita,

44:51.487 --> 44:54.054
you'd wanna pass through
our Nogales station.

44:54.056 --> 44:56.289
Same one you came through
on your way in.

44:56.291 --> 45:00.193
You're in Agua Prieta.
115 miles east of where you should be.

45:00.195 --> 45:02.262
Look, it's our
first time down here.

45:02.264 --> 45:05.032
I probably just
got turned around.

45:05.034 --> 45:07.934
This is a major quarter
for drug activity.

45:07.936 --> 45:10.237
A lot of people wanna
pass through here.

45:10.239 --> 45:12.405
People you don't wanna
run into.

45:12.407 --> 45:13.474
I understand.

45:13.476 --> 45:15.142
I'm very sorry.

45:15.144 --> 45:19.412
Well, I'm happy to get you
where you need to be.

45:19.414 --> 45:20.981
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

45:20.983 --> 45:22.784
Well, you got a GPS
or anything like that?

45:22.786 --> 45:24.722
Uh, I should.

45:28.958 --> 45:30.557
Well...

45:30.559 --> 45:32.795
I guess no vacation would be
complete without it, right?

49:16.518 --> 49:19.519
Any more of your buddies running
around I should know about?

49:19.521 --> 49:21.789
What are you guys
cooking up out here?

49:21.791 --> 49:24.025
If it's anything like
that last site we found,

49:24.027 --> 49:25.494
I'd venture to say your outfit
needs a new chef. Shit was weak.

49:29.164 --> 49:30.534
No.

49:36.539 --> 49:37.674
Get him some water.

51:08.264 --> 51:09.597
Miguel...

53:32.440 --> 53:33.909
Don't drink that.

53:47.489 --> 53:48.958
Jesus fuck.

53:50.326 --> 53:51.561
Shane.

53:56.431 --> 53:58.434
They aren't pedaling bottom
shelf product anymore.

54:05.407 --> 54:07.574
What the hell is that?

54:07.576 --> 54:09.409
No official name
in the books yet,

54:09.411 --> 54:12.313
but for now, they're calling
it Krokodil with a "K",

54:12.315 --> 54:15.849
gets its name from the pattern
it leaves on the victim's skin.

54:15.851 --> 54:18.818
We weren't sure if it had made
its way out of New Mexico yet,

54:18.820 --> 54:21.354
- guess we just got our answer.
- Is there a vaccine?

54:21.356 --> 54:23.423
Something we can administer
to at least fight it?

54:23.425 --> 54:25.358
Doubtful.

54:25.360 --> 54:26.526
Obviously, this little one
didn't mean for it to happen,

54:26.528 --> 54:27.927
so it was probably
an accident.

54:27.929 --> 54:29.530
Small amount in water,

54:29.532 --> 54:32.865
hell, maybe even
the constant fumes did it.

54:32.867 --> 54:34.767
Supposed to be the best
high in the market,

54:34.769 --> 54:36.936
but as you can see,
it comes with a cost.

54:36.938 --> 54:39.373
I don't suppose
you'll be sampling then.

54:39.375 --> 54:41.608
The more a person does,
the further it spreads over the body.

54:41.610 --> 54:43.976
You do enough of it,
she'll eat right through to the bone.

54:43.978 --> 54:47.447
It could be prone to spread through
saliva, maybe even contact.

54:47.449 --> 54:49.115
We'll get them in
to see somebody,

54:49.117 --> 54:51.418
get the little girl up
there, get the dad fixed up.

54:51.420 --> 54:53.653
You two come back
to HQ with me.

54:53.655 --> 54:56.592
Shane and the boys can wait for
emergency response to arrive.

01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:05.151
Sir?

01:02:05.153 --> 01:02:06.519
Hell of a day
from what I hear.

01:02:06.521 --> 01:02:09.789
- Y'all headed out for the night?
- Yeah.

01:02:09.791 --> 01:02:12.092
And it's more than
I can say for you.

01:02:12.094 --> 01:02:13.392
All good things in this job

01:02:13.394 --> 01:02:16.028
come with a whole
shit storm of paperwork.

01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:19.833
And with this 240lb seizure
of Croc this afternoon,

01:02:19.835 --> 01:02:23.068
it's created a whole
new list of problems.

01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:24.336
If that transport
hadn't been caught

01:02:24.338 --> 01:02:26.972
with a bag of cheap weed
in the glove box,

01:02:26.974 --> 01:02:29.275
this would all be sold
on every corner

01:02:29.277 --> 01:02:31.146
in the south barrio
by sundown.

01:02:33.014 --> 01:02:34.449
I took Sully along today.

01:02:35.583 --> 01:02:37.550
And?

01:02:37.552 --> 01:02:41.021
Well, Ivan's definitely a personality
that takes some getting used to.

01:02:41.023 --> 01:02:43.590
I mean,
his whole team is.

01:02:43.592 --> 01:02:46.927
But he did everything by the
book as far as I could tell.

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:49.362
Matter of fact,
he's the one that spotted it.

01:02:49.364 --> 01:02:52.833
If it hadn't been for him,
we might all be in the ICU right now.

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:55.434
Has he filled you in on the
rest of Ivan's activities

01:02:55.436 --> 01:02:57.537
- since his arrival?
- Yes.

01:02:57.539 --> 01:02:59.905
And I'm no way
defending him, sir.

01:02:59.907 --> 01:03:01.842
Good, don't.

01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:04.411
'Cause I called the station
chief over in Texas,

01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:06.412
he had the same
problems there.

01:03:06.414 --> 01:03:08.481
Cleaned up
a hell of a mess

01:03:08.483 --> 01:03:11.617
but he's a loose cannon when it
came to handling other affairs.

01:03:11.619 --> 01:03:13.485
So, how did
they handle him?

01:03:13.487 --> 01:03:16.423
From what I hear, the best thing
we can do is just wait him out,

01:03:16.425 --> 01:03:19.860
and that's exactly
what we're gonna do here.

01:03:19.862 --> 01:03:23.162
They'll move on from here
just like they did in Texas.

01:03:23.164 --> 01:03:25.197
What I don't
understand is,

01:03:25.199 --> 01:03:27.467
how something like this has been
allowed to go on for so long.

01:03:27.469 --> 01:03:29.936
I mean, I know
these are some higher-ups,

01:03:29.938 --> 01:03:33.606
but someone even above them
must've heard something by now.

01:03:33.608 --> 01:03:35.242
Unfortunately,
in cases like this,

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:37.577
where the primary objective
is being met,

01:03:37.579 --> 01:03:39.512
all else is forgiven.

01:03:39.514 --> 01:03:43.016
Ivan produces results,
so he's left alone.

01:03:43.018 --> 01:03:46.556
I can't say whether or not his
promise to boost NSA is true,

01:03:47.588 --> 01:03:49.421
what I can say is this,

01:03:49.423 --> 01:03:53.159
after what you've seen,
nobody, I mean, nobody,

01:03:53.161 --> 01:03:56.162
including me,
can expect you to stay with this guy.

01:03:56.164 --> 01:03:59.599
That's decision that's yours
and yours alone.

01:03:59.601 --> 01:04:03.637
Thank you, sir. But I have to
stay, and not for his offer.

01:04:03.639 --> 01:04:05.972
- Reyes...
- I want him to know that

01:04:05.974 --> 01:04:07.941
everything he's done
has been witnessed,

01:04:07.943 --> 01:04:10.209
and will be documented for the
day he has to answer to it.

01:04:10.211 --> 01:04:11.514
I don't want you
doing this.

01:04:14.215 --> 01:04:15.981
Is that an order?

01:04:15.983 --> 01:04:18.217
No, it's not an order.

01:04:18.219 --> 01:04:20.452
If this is something you feel
like you need to see through,

01:04:20.454 --> 01:04:22.155
then you do it together.

01:04:22.157 --> 01:04:24.925
But you stay back.
That is an order.

01:04:24.927 --> 01:04:27.026
Unfortunately,
we live in a time

01:04:27.028 --> 01:04:30.262
where the sun doesn't have to be
down for bad people to come out.

01:04:30.264 --> 01:04:31.299
You know what I mean?

01:04:33.268 --> 01:04:35.001
I'd like to speak with
the family from today,

01:04:35.003 --> 01:04:36.105
see how the kid
is holding up.

01:04:36.972 --> 01:04:38.371
What family?

01:04:38.373 --> 01:04:40.974
The family we retrieved
from the cook site today.

01:04:40.976 --> 01:04:42.979
Ivan's guys brought
the girl in for treatment.

01:04:45.112 --> 01:04:46.882
Reyes, they
came back alone.

01:04:55.289 --> 01:04:56.291
Reyes!

01:05:06.969 --> 01:05:08.371
Reyes!

01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:18.644
What the fuck
is your problem?

01:05:18.646 --> 01:05:20.315
- Where are they?
- Who?

01:05:21.615 --> 01:05:23.717
Don't fuck with me.

01:05:23.719 --> 01:05:25.318
You were supposed
to bring them in.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.720
What the fuck
did you do, Ivan?

01:05:26.722 --> 01:05:28.357
That's enough, Ivan.
Let him up

01:05:30.358 --> 01:05:33.059
Go back inside, Chief.

01:05:33.061 --> 01:05:36.528
I said let him up.

01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:38.630
You sure
you wanna do that?

01:05:38.632 --> 01:05:41.400
I doubt my people would
like hearing about this,

01:05:41.402 --> 01:05:42.769
not that it would
affect me any.

01:05:42.771 --> 01:05:44.604
You're the one who's
gonna be out of a job.

01:05:44.606 --> 01:05:46.740
That's a risk
I'm willing to take.

01:05:46.742 --> 01:05:48.340
At least we'd get
the answer to where

01:05:48.342 --> 01:05:50.677
a piece of shit
like you comes from.

01:05:50.679 --> 01:05:53.313
Now, I've asked you
twice to let him up.

01:05:53.315 --> 01:05:54.983
I won't ask a third time.

01:06:04.659 --> 01:06:07.092
You were supposed to
bring them back.

01:06:07.094 --> 01:06:10.195
- You saw the shape the kid was in.
- Exactly.

01:06:10.197 --> 01:06:12.664
We're dealing with an element
we don't understand.

01:06:12.666 --> 01:06:14.534
If we had
brought them in,

01:06:14.536 --> 01:06:16.436
this entire facility would
be on lock down right now

01:06:16.438 --> 01:06:17.771
under a plastic bubble,

01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:21.273
and we'd all be getting
scrubbed down by hazmat.

01:06:21.275 --> 01:06:25.378
Getting you to leave was the only way
I could do what needed to be done.

01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:28.615
- You mean killing them?
- Transporting them to CDC.

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:31.316
- That's bullshit.
- If you wanna go back out

01:06:31.318 --> 01:06:33.787
and dig through ditches,
be my guest.

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:36.722
But something like this
can't be taken lightly.

01:06:36.724 --> 01:06:39.059
If this proves
to be airborne,

01:06:39.061 --> 01:06:41.494
then they're exactly where
they need to be right now,

01:06:41.496 --> 01:06:44.166
with the lab coats
at disease control.

01:06:47.635 --> 01:06:50.135
You're too attached.

01:06:50.137 --> 01:06:51.804
Grow the fuck up
and realize that

01:06:51.806 --> 01:06:54.307
it's not about you wanting
to do the humane thing.

01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:56.543
- If it was up to me...
- If it was up to you,

01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:59.711
we'd all be in
jeopardy right now.

01:06:59.713 --> 01:07:03.749
I am this close to finally
putting this thing to bed forever

01:07:03.751 --> 01:07:05.651
and if you or you

01:07:05.653 --> 01:07:08.456
get in my way,
I will run you over.

01:07:14.362 --> 01:07:16.065
I think it's best

01:07:17.599 --> 01:07:21.133
that we just
run our course,

01:07:21.135 --> 01:07:23.139
finish this and then
we'll be on our way.

01:07:24.371 --> 01:07:26.271
No sense in anyone
getting hurt

01:07:26.273 --> 01:07:28.043
when we're all playing for the same side.
Right, Chief?

01:07:36.284 --> 01:07:38.450
Let's not let all
of this hide the fact

01:07:38.452 --> 01:07:40.153
that we did
solid work today

01:07:40.155 --> 01:07:42.458
getting intel on
a hot spot for resupply.

01:07:44.159 --> 01:07:46.391
We're hitting that
tomorrow,

01:07:46.393 --> 01:07:48.494
but tonight,
we celebrate.

01:07:48.496 --> 01:07:49.664
Celebrate what?

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:55.434
Another day that we get to
come home from this job.

01:07:55.436 --> 01:07:57.105
That's reason enough
for me.

01:08:53.426 --> 01:08:55.229
Hard time
finding the place, ladies?

01:09:12.247 --> 01:09:13.314
You made it.

01:09:14.649 --> 01:09:15.850
What do you think, slugger?

01:09:17.586 --> 01:09:19.952
Certainly not your first rodeo.

01:09:19.953 --> 01:09:21.390
Keg's over there.

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:24.593
- You good?
- Yeah.

01:09:28.662 --> 01:09:31.399
Sit or take a walk,
but don't just fuckin' stand there.

01:09:43.877 --> 01:09:45.447
You good for tomorrow?

01:09:46.014 --> 01:09:47.314
Why?

01:09:47.948 --> 01:09:49.816
Big day for you,

01:09:49.818 --> 01:09:52.551
first time running your
luck with the Chacal boys.

01:09:52.554 --> 01:09:54.387
What makes you say that?

01:09:54.389 --> 01:09:56.623
Those guys back at the
cook site were cartel guys.

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:58.260
No.

01:09:59.426 --> 01:10:00.994
Those were pissant
errand boys,

01:10:00.996 --> 01:10:02.864
"pledges" if they have
such a thing.

01:10:04.765 --> 01:10:08.000
And I know it's your first time.
I see it in your eyes.

01:10:08.002 --> 01:10:11.336
There's still a lot
they haven't seen.

01:10:11.338 --> 01:10:13.839
Been in this long enough to tell
who's everything, and who hasn't.

01:10:13.841 --> 01:10:14.876
Same for Sully.

01:10:16.778 --> 01:10:18.710
Something happened
that almost took him away,

01:10:18.712 --> 01:10:19.981
now it's carved
in his face.

01:10:21.382 --> 01:10:22.784
and it'll never change.

01:10:24.786 --> 01:10:26.454
I don't know what it was,

01:10:27.454 --> 01:10:28.690
but he came close.

01:10:30.658 --> 01:10:32.525
It wasn't Cartel,
if that's what you think.

01:10:32.527 --> 01:10:35.294
I know that.

01:10:35.296 --> 01:10:38.563
I don't glorify them the
way everyone else seems to.

01:10:38.565 --> 01:10:39.866
The only thing that
separates them

01:10:39.868 --> 01:10:42.468
from any other bad person
out there with a gun

01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:44.771
is numbers and organization.

01:10:44.773 --> 01:10:46.071
Anybody can pull a trigger.

01:10:46.073 --> 01:10:47.842
It's not all you gotta
be prepared for.

01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:51.009
It's the aftermath,

01:10:51.011 --> 01:10:53.812
shit they leave
in their wake.

01:10:53.814 --> 01:10:55.850
That kind of inhumanity
stays with you.

01:10:57.952 --> 01:11:01.620
Sometimes, I think I could
have stayed where I was at.

01:11:01.622 --> 01:11:05.458
Nice desk job in DC, steady paycheck.
Really steady.

01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:08.361
Stayed married.

01:11:08.363 --> 01:11:11.833
But after 14 years of the same
shit, a man wants more.

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:15.735
She said she'd leave.

01:11:15.737 --> 01:11:18.340
if I took the job.
She thought it'd change me.

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:21.010
Did it?

01:11:24.511 --> 01:11:26.446
No, Reyes.

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:29.115
I've always
been a patriot.

01:11:29.117 --> 01:11:31.483
I have the old man
to thank for that.

01:11:31.485 --> 01:11:34.454
I just grew tired of...

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:37.089
hearing about
the same fuckin' people

01:11:37.091 --> 01:11:39.959
helping themselves
to my home, my...

01:11:39.961 --> 01:11:41.195
home, my opportunities.

01:11:44.099 --> 01:11:46.699
That's when I decided to put
myself on the very front line

01:11:46.701 --> 01:11:48.470
and do anything
I could to stop it.

01:11:51.739 --> 01:11:55.644
Give up anything including...
a 14 year-old marriage.

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.147
Sounds like
quite the decision,

01:12:01.149 --> 01:12:02.518
leaving that all behind,

01:12:03.385 --> 01:12:05.020
somebody that loves you.

01:12:06.654 --> 01:12:08.888
I'm just trying to
ask myself...

01:12:08.890 --> 01:12:11.327
was I happy,
or just unaware.

01:12:13.494 --> 01:12:18.030
When you give up everything
except that one thing...

01:12:18.032 --> 01:12:20.732
that you really care about,

01:12:20.734 --> 01:12:24.771
you're able to be the very
best at that one thing.

01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:26.842
You protect it from anything
that comes in its path.

01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:30.645
That one thing
for me is country.

01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:34.650
I bet a lot of people have
been caught in your path.

01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:37.920
Mm-hm.

01:12:40.854 --> 01:12:43.856
And you don't remember
a single face, do you?

01:12:43.858 --> 01:12:45.558
They're all
a stack of papers.

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.563
Well, that's not
entirely true, Reyes.

01:12:49.029 --> 01:12:51.097
The coyotes transporting

01:12:51.099 --> 01:12:53.936
a truck load of shooters to
a checkpoint for an ambush,

01:12:54.868 --> 01:12:56.438
I remember their faces.

01:12:57.671 --> 01:12:58.706
The woman...

01:12:59.807 --> 01:13:01.107
dragging the filthy mattress

01:13:01.109 --> 01:13:02.741
stuffed with
three dead infants

01:13:02.743 --> 01:13:04.645
back to the family
they've been abducted from.

01:13:05.979 --> 01:13:09.417
Not good with names,
but I remember her, too.

01:13:10.518 --> 01:13:12.552
Just the bad ones then.

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:14.553
What about anybody legal

01:13:14.555 --> 01:13:16.491
that's been unfortunate enough
to come in contact with you?

01:13:18.059 --> 01:13:19.862
Oh, I remember you.

01:13:27.167 --> 01:13:28.903
Fine, fine.

01:13:30.171 --> 01:13:31.640
El Paso.

01:13:33.841 --> 01:13:36.107
Shane and I had been...

01:13:36.109 --> 01:13:39.678
holed up with the guys
in a shit ass motel

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.983
with no AC
for about eight days,

01:13:43.184 --> 01:13:44.753
waiting to...

01:13:46.253 --> 01:13:48.487
get a tip on
the whereabouts of

01:13:48.489 --> 01:13:51.123
Nesto "The Diamond" Padilla.

01:13:51.125 --> 01:13:53.862
Nesto was number three
on the Chacal chain.

01:14:28.095 --> 01:14:31.597
- Ivan?
- I don't know what happened.

01:14:31.599 --> 01:14:34.866
Adrenaline from the fight,

01:14:34.868 --> 01:14:39.705
being cooped up with
four guys in a hotel,

01:14:39.707 --> 01:14:41.810
a wound still fresh
from a divorce.

01:14:44.679 --> 01:14:48.817
Even seeing
your friend get shot.

01:14:50.150 --> 01:14:52.186
But something
came over me, Reyes.

01:16:22.409 --> 01:16:25.177
I did the right thing.

01:16:25.179 --> 01:16:26.379
The husband
didn't even fight us

01:16:26.381 --> 01:16:27.783
putting him on
the back of a bus.

01:16:28.682 --> 01:16:30.715
More importantly,

01:16:30.717 --> 01:16:34.120
cartel have one less
place to hide from me.

01:16:34.122 --> 01:16:37.626
Do you know why they
called him "The Diamond"?

01:16:38.426 --> 01:16:39.895
Motherfucker has a...

01:16:40.962 --> 01:16:43.632
14-carat rock for a tooth.

01:16:45.667 --> 01:16:47.869
I bet that shit's
a blood diamond, too.

01:16:49.936 --> 01:16:51.640
Never did catch him.

01:16:59.814 --> 01:17:00.983
Hey, Reyes.

01:17:02.850 --> 01:17:04.319
Thanks for coming by.

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:06.721
Really.

01:18:17.457 --> 01:18:18.993
You sure about this?

01:18:21.762 --> 01:18:23.896
You don't have to come.

01:18:23.898 --> 01:18:28.134
I'll tell them you're too hungover
from last night or whatever,

01:18:28.136 --> 01:18:31.771
but I'm going,
even if you don't have my back.

01:18:31.773 --> 01:18:33.074
It's not what I'm saying.

01:18:37.244 --> 01:18:38.345
Really?

01:18:40.347 --> 01:18:42.514
'Cause I kinda think it is.

01:18:42.516 --> 01:18:44.086
This isn't what
you and I do.

01:18:45.185 --> 01:18:47.253
Kicking down doors,

01:18:47.255 --> 01:18:48.724
fire fights,

01:18:51.125 --> 01:18:52.761
we don't have
the training for it,

01:18:53.493 --> 01:18:55.894
to survive it.

01:18:55.896 --> 01:18:57.963
You're the one who wanted to
go out with these guys so bad.

01:18:57.965 --> 01:18:59.898
What happened?

01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:02.237
I just don't have a good
feeling about today, okay, man.

01:19:03.436 --> 01:19:05.407
- I'm scared.
- So am I.

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:09.308
But that and fear aside,

01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:12.076
you didn't have to hear
the things he said to me.

01:19:12.078 --> 01:19:14.580
If I don't do something while
I have him in my sights,

01:19:14.582 --> 01:19:16.418
he's gonna
disappear forever.

01:19:21.154 --> 01:19:22.923
I need you on this, man.

01:19:37.505 --> 01:19:38.806
Reyes.

01:19:39.873 --> 01:19:41.574
You're here early, Chief.

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:43.942
Yeah, I came to
see y'all off.

01:19:43.944 --> 01:19:46.445
Listen, be careful
out there today.

01:19:46.447 --> 01:19:48.379
Hang back,
let Ivan do this thing

01:19:48.381 --> 01:19:50.351
so he can get out of here
as soon as possible.

01:19:54.488 --> 01:19:57.455
Listen, do not draw a line
in the sand with this man

01:19:57.457 --> 01:20:00.459
unless you're prepared to
have him step across it.

01:20:00.461 --> 01:20:01.797
Read me?

01:20:04.097 --> 01:20:06.067
All right. See y'all
when you get back.

01:20:15.309 --> 01:20:17.476
All right, guys,
the day is here.

01:20:17.478 --> 01:20:19.410
Since beefing up the two
main arteries at the border,

01:20:19.412 --> 01:20:21.981
Three Points has become the
biggest trafficking corridor.

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:23.249
That's where we're going.

01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:26.117
Our target sits in
a very open area of land,

01:20:26.119 --> 01:20:29.053
which leaves a lot of room for
hazard and none for mistakes.

01:20:29.055 --> 01:20:31.257
BP has been kind enough
to convoy with us,

01:20:31.259 --> 01:20:33.358
but in order to maintain
the element of surprise,

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:36.227
we're gonna have to break it
off and hoof it a mile out.

01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:38.998
This is a large resupply hub
for the Chacal Cartel,

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.002
headed over by
our boy, Javier Arturo.

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:44.969
We don't know what
we'll be walking into,

01:20:44.971 --> 01:20:47.406
our objective is to cut off any resources
they have when crossing the border,

01:20:47.408 --> 01:20:49.674
and prevent any more of this
nasty shit from coming in.

01:20:49.676 --> 01:20:52.644
If you find any of
the substance on site,

01:20:52.646 --> 01:20:54.146
back the fuck off.

01:20:54.148 --> 01:20:56.518
<i>That's a hazmat issue,
not ours.</i>

01:20:58.653 --> 01:21:01.120
<i>We're going in to clear,</i>

01:21:01.122 --> 01:21:03.121
<i>gather information on any more of
the little motels that they have,</i>

01:21:03.123 --> 01:21:05.023
<i>and get the fuck out.</i>

01:21:05.025 --> 01:21:08.329
As always, hope for the
best, prepare for worst.

01:28:38.412 --> 01:28:40.077
Go out the back.

01:29:32.632 --> 01:29:34.199
Do I look familiar?

01:29:34.201 --> 01:29:35.733
I'm here anyway.

01:29:35.735 --> 01:29:38.503
What the fuck, you hit me!

01:29:53.619 --> 01:29:56.455
- Everybody else all right?
- House is clear.

01:29:56.457 --> 01:29:58.659
Do another sweep,
see what you can find.

01:30:01.994 --> 01:30:03.497
- It's clear.
- Good.

01:30:09.101 --> 01:30:11.439
Any more of your friends
running around out there, Pablo?

01:30:13.105 --> 01:30:15.773
No <i>Ingles?</i>

01:30:15.775 --> 01:30:18.045
You should learn it by now,
help you fit in well with the locals.

01:30:19.479 --> 01:30:21.780
Who else is out here?

01:30:21.782 --> 01:30:23.548
I really don't like
surprises, so tell me now,

01:30:23.550 --> 01:30:26.183
and you might
get out of this alive.

01:30:26.185 --> 01:30:28.155
'cause it's not looking
so good for you right now.

01:30:31.123 --> 01:30:33.126
What about shipment? Kroc?

01:30:35.194 --> 01:30:37.798
I know you didn't come up here
for sightseeing, so where is it?

01:30:38.564 --> 01:30:41.066
Where's it going?

01:30:41.068 --> 01:30:43.538
How many more of these little
vacation spots you got, hmm?

01:30:45.905 --> 01:30:47.171
Come up here,
little fiesta,

01:30:47.173 --> 01:30:48.943
blow each other
in the back room.

01:30:53.579 --> 01:30:55.780
We hit a funny bone,
didn't we?

01:30:55.782 --> 01:30:57.851
I think you do <i>habla ingles</i>
just fine, don't you?

01:31:01.555 --> 01:31:04.688
How 'bout I skin you and your
little fuckin' boyfriends,

01:31:04.690 --> 01:31:07.291
hang you out and leave the
vultures to get at you, huh?

01:31:07.293 --> 01:31:11.263
I think that'd wipe the fuckin'
grin off your stupid fuckin' face.

01:31:11.265 --> 01:31:14.532
You think their deaths
weigh heavy on me?

01:31:14.534 --> 01:31:17.835
You don't get attached
in this business.

01:31:17.837 --> 01:31:22.107
Any day, any damned day
can be your last.

01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:24.276
So, if you're gonna
threaten me,

01:31:24.278 --> 01:31:26.311
you're gonna have to
try harder.

01:31:26.313 --> 01:31:28.216
Place is clean.

01:31:33.185 --> 01:31:34.721
Know what's nice
about this?

01:31:35.889 --> 01:31:38.322
It doesn't run
out of bullets.

01:31:38.324 --> 01:31:41.028
I can stick this anywhere
until the sun goes down.

01:31:47.701 --> 01:31:49.737
I know you have
more supply stops.

01:31:50.237 --> 01:31:52.771
Where?

01:31:52.773 --> 01:31:56.840
Even if I told you,
you'd still kill me.

01:31:56.842 --> 01:31:59.143
See, I've know
men like you.

01:31:59.145 --> 01:32:02.046
Your country has monsters

01:32:02.048 --> 01:32:06.317
- worse than ours.
- That's how we're able to to protect it.

01:32:06.319 --> 01:32:10.220
You will not leave this life
without paying for your crimes.

01:32:10.222 --> 01:32:12.260
- Tell me where!
- That's enough, Ivan.

01:32:19.733 --> 01:32:22.032
What are you doing, Reyes?

01:32:22.034 --> 01:32:25.070
- Putting and end to this.
- To what?

01:32:25.072 --> 01:32:28.009
Getting intel from the enemy?
Doing the job we all signed up to do?

01:32:28.942 --> 01:32:31.279
No. To you.

01:32:33.346 --> 01:32:37.182
Reyes, without me,
there's no NSA boost.

01:32:37.184 --> 01:32:39.587
You'll stay right where you
are birdwatching at the fence.

01:32:41.054 --> 01:32:42.821
I can live with that.

01:32:42.823 --> 01:32:44.321
Letting you leave

01:32:44.323 --> 01:32:46.290
and continue doing
what you're doing...

01:32:46.292 --> 01:32:48.862
- is something I can't.
- So what?

01:32:49.863 --> 01:32:51.696
You'll bury us all,

01:32:51.698 --> 01:32:53.868
drag him back to big daddy
Morris, be the hero.

01:32:54.266 --> 01:32:56.034
That it?

01:32:56.036 --> 01:32:58.937
He's more valuable
to us alive than dead.

01:32:58.939 --> 01:33:01.275
I'm not gonna waste the fucking
energy digging you a grave.

01:33:07.247 --> 01:33:09.147
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:33:09.149 --> 01:33:11.383
Now that that's off the
table, what are you gonna do?

01:33:11.385 --> 01:33:13.785
Drop the gun.
Drop it!

01:33:13.787 --> 01:33:17.222
Fine.

01:33:17.224 --> 01:33:19.159
But only because
I know this isn't you.

01:33:22.996 --> 01:33:25.830
You're not gonna
shoot anyone.

01:33:25.832 --> 01:33:28.900
You have no escape plan
and you know it.

01:33:28.902 --> 01:33:31.803
Six of us go in and only
two of you come out?

01:33:31.805 --> 01:33:34.873
Might look a little suspect
when my people come knocking.

01:33:34.875 --> 01:33:36.808
Especially, when four of
their senior tasks agents

01:33:36.810 --> 01:33:39.410
couldn't handle five of these
little lanky motherfuckers?

01:33:39.412 --> 01:33:40.814
Not likely.

01:33:41.715 --> 01:33:42.946
You say five.

01:33:42.948 --> 01:33:46.918
Maybe I say 15
and the others got away,

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:48.154
but not before
mowing your team down.

01:33:49.890 --> 01:33:51.759
Guess I taught you something
after all, didn't I?

01:33:53.726 --> 01:33:55.259
But you're not gonna
pull that trigger

01:33:55.261 --> 01:33:57.163
because that'll make you
on step closer to being me.

01:33:59.099 --> 01:34:01.232
You put down that gun down,

01:34:01.234 --> 01:34:03.101
and there's a chance everybody
can get out of here alive

01:34:03.103 --> 01:34:04.872
and we'll put it all
behind us.

01:34:06.238 --> 01:34:09.040
You did a hell of a thing
today, both of you.

01:34:09.042 --> 01:34:11.809
Cut off a major artery
to the enemy,

01:34:11.811 --> 01:34:14.478
and now, they'll slowly
funnel south

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:16.016
until they're back
on their own side.

01:34:17.917 --> 01:34:19.718
Damn fine work
for two guys

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:21.385
who were just watching
the fence three weeks ago.

01:34:33.466 --> 01:34:35.099
I had every intention
of keeping my word

01:34:35.101 --> 01:34:36.804
and moving on
when the job was done.

01:34:37.369 --> 01:34:38.706
I really did.

01:34:44.911 --> 01:34:48.879
You are where you are because of
the decisions that you made, Reyes.

01:34:48.881 --> 01:34:50.717
And now you put somebody
else's life on the line.

01:34:53.386 --> 01:34:54.922
How's that make you feel?

01:34:56.823 --> 01:34:59.456
You're a good man, Reyes.

01:34:59.458 --> 01:35:04.461
You stand up for your values and your
beliefs, just as I do. I respect that.

01:35:04.463 --> 01:35:06.867
Which is why I hate that
you put me in this position.

01:35:09.002 --> 01:35:10.771
But that's the nature
of the job,

01:35:12.204 --> 01:35:13.871
to do what
other people won't do,

01:35:13.873 --> 01:35:16.443
to remove yourself
from right and wrong.

01:35:18.011 --> 01:35:19.811
It's what the people
don't see

01:35:19.813 --> 01:35:22.813
that keeps
the country safe.

01:35:22.815 --> 01:35:26.084
Unfortunately,
now you've had to see those things.

01:35:26.086 --> 01:35:29.320
So, murdering a child and her
father is keeping us safe?

01:35:29.322 --> 01:35:30.858
- Collateral damage.
- No.

01:35:31.358 --> 01:35:32.557
Don't.

01:35:32.559 --> 01:35:34.159
I know what you are.

01:35:34.161 --> 01:35:36.361
Morris knows what you are.

01:35:36.363 --> 01:35:38.196
Morris is smart and
wants to keep his desk.

01:35:38.198 --> 01:35:40.365
Every station head
is the same.

01:35:40.367 --> 01:35:43.802
They keep their mouth shut
and let me pass through.

01:35:43.804 --> 01:35:45.436
Well, you can believe
I'm gonna talk,

01:35:45.438 --> 01:35:47.138
make sure this whole
fucking thing spills.

01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:49.977
No. You won't.

01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:52.376
Yeah.

01:35:52.378 --> 01:35:53.948
Every fucking word.

01:35:59.819 --> 01:36:01.054
Sully...

01:36:04.090 --> 01:36:05.156
I don't know
the story on you,

01:36:05.158 --> 01:36:07.157
but you seem
like a nice guy.

01:36:07.159 --> 01:36:09.593
Were you married?
Have kids?

01:36:09.595 --> 01:36:10.864
Yeah.

01:36:11.931 --> 01:36:14.001
- A daughter.
- How old?

01:36:16.136 --> 01:36:17.602
Teenager.

01:36:17.604 --> 01:36:18.438
That's nice.

01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:22.440
Anything you want
your partner to tell her

01:36:22.442 --> 01:36:23.875
since you won't be
coming home?

01:36:23.877 --> 01:36:25.576
He won't say anything, Ivan.

01:36:25.578 --> 01:36:27.148
This is between us.

01:36:30.583 --> 01:36:32.252
It's all right, man.

01:36:39.259 --> 01:36:42.460
Have you swayed your stance
on the situation yet?

01:36:42.462 --> 01:36:44.195
Get you back to HQ,
get you fixed up,

01:36:44.197 --> 01:36:46.464
you'll be back at
the fence in six weeks.

01:36:46.466 --> 01:36:49.968
Tell the NSA what a fine
upstanding agent Reyes Abeyta is,

01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:51.870
worthy of promotion,

01:36:51.872 --> 01:36:54.141
and most importantly,
you never have to see me again.

01:36:56.643 --> 01:36:59.579
All this can be yours for
the promise of silence.

01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:04.048
What do you say?

01:37:04.050 --> 01:37:07.117
I say you're a piece of shit
disgrace to your nation,

01:37:07.119 --> 01:37:09.519
who doesn't
deserve this freedom.

01:37:09.521 --> 01:37:11.589
Just like the man
who raised you.

01:37:29.442 --> 01:37:31.108
And yours
would be disappointed

01:37:31.110 --> 01:37:32.179
that you gave up everything
that you worked for.

01:38:27.333 --> 01:38:28.402
No.

01:38:31.237 --> 01:38:34.539
You don't speak to me
in the language

01:38:34.541 --> 01:38:37.508
of the people you abandoned.

01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:41.448
And you've been fighting
the war against my product.

01:38:42.649 --> 01:38:44.318
I think you know
who I am.

01:38:46.252 --> 01:38:48.719
I sure know
who you are.

01:38:48.721 --> 01:38:51.621
One of our own in uniform.

01:38:51.623 --> 01:38:53.193
I had to see it
to believe it.

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:57.131
And here you are.

01:39:02.202 --> 01:39:04.736
A lot of bloodshed,

01:39:04.738 --> 01:39:07.441
not likely the work
of two people.

01:39:09.042 --> 01:39:11.045
Where's the rest
of your boys?

01:39:12.511 --> 01:39:14.414
They left you, didn't they?

01:39:17.417 --> 01:39:21.184
You chose
the wrong side, Pocho.

01:39:21.186 --> 01:39:23.489
You have to be
feeling that now.

01:39:28.261 --> 01:39:29.663
Definitely now.

01:39:32.765 --> 01:39:34.233
Do what you're here to do.

01:39:38.304 --> 01:39:40.106
When I first heard of you,

01:39:41.173 --> 01:39:43.074
I was...

01:39:43.076 --> 01:39:46.611
sickened, disgusted
to my core.

01:39:46.613 --> 01:39:50.083
You would turn away your
own kind for a better life.

01:39:52.385 --> 01:39:54.052
I wouldn't want to live here.

01:39:54.054 --> 01:39:55.221
I love my country,

01:39:56.088 --> 01:39:57.421
my home,

01:39:57.423 --> 01:39:59.525
but... I get it

01:40:01.194 --> 01:40:02.826
You don't know
anything about me.

01:40:02.828 --> 01:40:05.362
But I do.

01:40:05.364 --> 01:40:07.799
Your family wanted
to get out,

01:40:07.801 --> 01:40:11.501
come live with
the gringos, that's fine.

01:40:11.503 --> 01:40:14.675
But... to put on
this uniform,

01:40:16.475 --> 01:40:19.277
take that oath against us,

01:40:19.279 --> 01:40:23.283
even to a guy like me,
that's... cold blooded.

01:40:24.216 --> 01:40:26.052
Unforgivable.

01:40:27.319 --> 01:40:30.254
After I got through
the phase of

01:40:30.256 --> 01:40:34.224
what I'd do to you
if I ever found you,

01:40:34.226 --> 01:40:37.564
I started to see you
as a blessing in disguise.

01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:40.197
Why kill you,

01:40:40.199 --> 01:40:44.037
when I could finally have
eyes and ears on the inside.

01:40:45.671 --> 01:40:48.873
You made a long trip
to be disappointed.

01:40:48.875 --> 01:40:50.210
Did I?

01:40:53.179 --> 01:40:56.347
A gun in my face
won't sway me.

01:40:56.349 --> 01:41:00.718
The same way it didn't when the last
one of you fucks tried it on my father.

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:02.588
And he's dead.

01:41:03.890 --> 01:41:07.094
These aren't your beliefs,
they're his.

01:41:08.261 --> 01:41:10.160
You're a free man,

01:41:10.162 --> 01:41:14.132
able to make his own
choice, walk his own road.

01:41:14.134 --> 01:41:16.334
His was a selfish one

01:41:16.336 --> 01:41:19.539
that left your mother
on her own.

01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:23.674
How is Elena, by the way?

01:41:26.645 --> 01:41:28.345
No.

01:41:28.347 --> 01:41:30.214
I won't kill her.

01:41:30.216 --> 01:41:32.782
She'll come work for me.

01:41:32.784 --> 01:41:36.320
I'll put Elena
on her own corner

01:41:36.322 --> 01:41:38.559
on the busiest street
in the entire city,

01:41:39.893 --> 01:41:41.694
buy her some new clothes,

01:41:42.561 --> 01:41:45.595
show a little skin.

01:41:45.597 --> 01:41:49.235
My girls have been known to pull
in $4,000 to $5,000 in a week.

01:41:52.505 --> 01:41:56.577
Sometimes...
I'm guilty of sampling myself.

01:41:57.644 --> 01:42:00.777
I'm a gentle soul.

01:42:00.779 --> 01:42:03.649
But I can't say the same
for these pigs.

01:42:08.253 --> 01:42:10.623
I can make you
a very wealthy man, Reyes.

01:42:11.957 --> 01:42:15.293
You won't have to pull
a single trigger.

01:42:15.295 --> 01:42:19.296
Whenever a move is made,
you just let me know, okay?

01:42:19.298 --> 01:42:20.598
That's it.

01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:23.567
You can continue
living where you are,

01:42:23.569 --> 01:42:26.704
be financially
secure forever,

01:42:26.706 --> 01:42:29.275
you never even have to
see me ever again.

01:42:30.909 --> 01:42:32.479
What do you say?

01:43:06.576 --> 01:43:11.576
