00:15.016 --> 00:16.415
Can't you hold it?

00:16.417 --> 00:18.150
No, I can't.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.585
Why the hell not?

00:19.587 --> 00:22.121
See, you're
just like my wife.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.356
When we go to Jones Beach
with the kids,

00:24.358 --> 00:26.625
she stops six times
along the way.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.360
So I tell her,
"Put a cork in it."

00:28.362 --> 00:32.364
She says,
"No, no, pull over.
I have to go."

00:32.366 --> 00:33.799
Maybe if you had
put a cork in it,

00:33.801 --> 00:35.801
she wouldn't have
had six kids

00:35.803 --> 00:37.369
and ruined
her plumbing.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.637

MAN:
What's going on?
Why are you doing this?

00:41.509 --> 00:43.809
WOMAN:
Well, what did you think
that I would do?

00:43.811 --> 00:45.377
(<i> man and woman</i>
<i>continue arguing</i> )

00:45.379 --> 00:47.646
Would you
do me a favor--

00:47.648 --> 00:49.615
get me a cruller?

00:49.617 --> 00:54.286
WOMAN:
Why don't you just try
to figure it out?

00:54.288 --> 00:56.388
I have no idea
why you're so upset,
and that's why...

00:56.390 --> 00:58.524
Come out of there
this minute. Come out!

00:58.526 --> 01:00.559
Hey, sister,

01:00.561 --> 01:02.361
got some spare change?

01:05.833 --> 01:09.435
Can I get a cruller
and a coffee regular?

01:09.437 --> 01:10.569
<i>I want you to marry me.</i>

01:10.571 --> 01:11.670
<i>Why would I...?</i>

01:17.144 --> 01:20.479
That will be
a buck and a quarter.

01:26.153 --> 01:28.687
<i> You can't ask me</i>
<i> to marry you</i>

01:28.689 --> 01:31.390

Your change.

01:48.676 --> 01:53.145
I don't think we can
start all over again, Nathan.

01:53.147 --> 01:54.413
Let's do it.
Let's just do it.

01:54.415 --> 01:55.681
We'll do it tonight.

01:55.683 --> 01:56.682
Oh, God,
stop bugging me.

01:56.684 --> 01:57.683
"Bugging you"?

01:57.685 --> 01:59.651
Is that what you call this?

01:59.653 --> 02:01.353
Mimi!

02:03.624 --> 02:06.658

Hey!

02:06.660 --> 02:08.360

02:17.238 --> 02:19.204

(<i> siren wails )</i>

04:23.397 --> 04:24.663
And night before last,

04:24.665 --> 04:27.499
there was a naked man
with a crossbow

04:27.501 --> 04:30.269
running up and down
west 74th Street.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.504
Where did he
keep the arrows?

Why don't some of you people
move to Nebraska?

04:38.579 --> 04:40.512
I'm from Nebraska, sweetie.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.347
How do you think I got this way?

04:42.349 --> 04:44.783
All right, did anybody see
the actual stabbing?

04:44.785 --> 04:46.451
The one we're talking about?

05:11.445 --> 05:13.495
The Sherry
Netherland--

05:13.496 --> 05:15.546
a little<i> pied-a-terre</i> for those
gala Dumpster parties.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.481
Riverside Park
in 80s.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.417
I got to go.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.551
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.420
I didn't see anything.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.587
CERRETA:
Of course not.

05:22.589 --> 05:24.389
Was she in the box?

05:24.391 --> 05:25.891
I didn't see anybody
in the box.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.960
Okay, but you all did see
Mr. Robbins fall to the ground?

05:30.464 --> 05:33.498
You were all standing there.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.668
There...<i> was</i> a guy.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.403
LOGAN:
Fine.

05:38.405 --> 05:39.771
Describe him.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.640
5'10".

05:41.642 --> 05:43.642
Uh-uh.
6'2" at least.

05:43.644 --> 05:44.643
Ma'am?

05:44.645 --> 05:46.645
A man went running away.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.847
He was well over six feet.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.549
What was he wearing?

05:50.551 --> 05:51.883
HATCH:
a red parka.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.386
A greasy red parka.

05:54.388 --> 05:55.654
A parka?

05:55.655 --> 05:56.921
I'm sitting here,
I'm sweating like a pig,

05:56.924 --> 05:59.424
and you're telling me
this guy was in a ski parka?

05:59.426 --> 06:00.425
No, no, no,
no, no.

06:00.427 --> 06:01.927
He was wearing overalls.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.796
I've seen this slob before,
sleeping in cardboard boxes.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.598
Miss Murdoch?

06:06.600 --> 06:08.734
It happened too fast.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.502
Did you get a look at the man
in the box?

06:10.504 --> 06:12.554
I need new glasses.

06:12.555 --> 06:14.605
They told me at Social Services
I could get some, but...

06:14.608 --> 06:17.008
I saw a red parka

06:17.010 --> 06:19.644
with a torn pocket.

06:19.646 --> 06:20.779
Okay.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.447
The red parka, huh--

06:22.449 --> 06:24.649
was he in the box?

06:24.651 --> 06:25.884
No.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.552
Running away.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.171
Oh, man.

06:29.172 --> 06:30.789
I just talked to the people
in E.R.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.557
The kid was D.O.A.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.764
Isn't it funny
how three bystanders

06:38.766 --> 06:42.401
failed to notice a stabbing
right under their noses?

06:42.403 --> 06:44.836
Where was the girlfriend
during all this?

06:44.838 --> 06:46.838
She was inside
the coffee shop.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.473
Or just coming out.
Whatever.

06:48.475 --> 06:50.509
Everything everyone saw
is contradictory.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.577
Okay, it was
a lovers' quarrel.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.880
But she shivs him
three witnesses?

06:54.882 --> 06:56.581
Well, they were<i> great</i>
witnesses.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.916
Crime of passion
could explain

06:57.918 --> 06:59.985
why he still had
the wallet on him.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.453
Or a botched robbery.

07:01.455 --> 07:02.721
Yeah, all right,
forget the girlfriend.

07:02.723 --> 07:03.989
Let's say it was a mugger.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.724
He got scared off before
he could get to the money.

07:05.726 --> 07:06.725
Or maybe he just got mad

07:06.727 --> 07:08.493
because somebody
kicked his box.

07:08.495 --> 07:09.461
Well, wouldn't you?

07:09.463 --> 07:10.729
Don't you kick my box.

07:10.731 --> 07:14.599
Let's  got find out if
that girl's recovered.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.538
All right, Mimi.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.540
You were
in the coffee shop.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.808
Then you came out.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.776
What's the first
thing you saw?

07:24.778 --> 07:25.777
I don't know.

07:25.779 --> 07:26.812
I don't remember.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.713
Did you see the guy
in the box?

07:28.715 --> 07:30.015
No.

07:30.017 --> 07:34.486
Did you see a man
in a red jacket?

07:34.488 --> 07:37.055
All I saw
were Nathan's feet--

07:37.057 --> 07:41.493
his legs sticking out
from under that box.

07:42.529 --> 07:45.797
What were you and Nathan
arguing about?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.532
We weren't arguing.

07:47.534 --> 07:52.704
We... we never fought,
hardly ever.

07:52.706 --> 07:56.708
We were just having
a discussion, okay?

07:56.710 --> 07:57.943
Okay.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.845
What were you discussing?

08:01.582 --> 08:03.782
It was private.

08:03.784 --> 08:06.051
Miss Sternhagen,

08:06.053 --> 08:09.588
I know it's a very rough time
for you right now,

08:09.590 --> 08:12.824
but this
is a homicide
investigation,

08:12.826 --> 08:16.995
and from here on,
very few things will be private.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.064
Well, we weren't fighting.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.967
You were animated?

08:21.969 --> 08:23.502
Maybe.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.504
All right,
all right.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.739
About anything in particular?

08:27.741 --> 08:29.140
Um...

08:29.142 --> 08:32.544
well, we were at a party,

08:32.546 --> 08:34.813
and we were both kind of bombed.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.049
I just...

08:38.051 --> 08:42.521
I didn't want to be proposed to
like that.

08:42.523 --> 08:45.156
I always thought it would be

08:45.158 --> 08:48.960
on a boat sailing to Paris
or something,

08:48.962 --> 08:52.097
not him waving
a ring around, going

08:52.099 --> 08:55.767
"Let's do it,
let's do it."

08:55.769 --> 08:57.802
Then what happened?

08:59.740 --> 09:01.640
(<i> sighs )</i>

09:01.642 --> 09:03.942
I walked into the coffee shop.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.077
I walked out.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.046
Nathan was gone.

09:08.048 --> 09:12.117
Mimi, the ring-- the one he's
waving-- what happened to it?

09:12.119 --> 09:14.152
I don't know.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.061
Did you ever see him
with a knife?

09:23.063 --> 09:25.063
If I say yes,

09:25.064 --> 09:27.064
does that get him
out of my doorway permanently?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.167
Hey, listen, you help us,
we'll help you, all right?

09:29.169 --> 09:30.802
Tony, take this.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.938
Look, the guy is crazy.

09:32.940 --> 09:36.608
He thinks everybody he sees
is a KGB agent.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.578
I told him the Cold War
was over, kaput,

09:39.580 --> 09:42.013
so he thinks
I'm a KGB agent,

09:42.015 --> 09:43.114
trying to fake him out.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.115
The knife?

09:44.117 --> 09:46.184
I never saw a knife.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.953
Okay, describe him.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.955
5'10", crewcut.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.590
That makes it
a lot easier.

09:51.592 --> 09:52.591
Color?

09:52.593 --> 09:53.725
Yellow.

09:53.726 --> 09:54.858
What do you mean, yellow,
like Chinese?

09:54.861 --> 09:56.161
Like jaundice.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.229
A lot of these street people
have hepatitis

09:58.231 --> 10:00.098
and God knows what else.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.100
Does he usually
wear a red parka?

10:02.102 --> 10:04.836
No, overalls.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.838
Do you have any idea

10:06.840 --> 10:10.108
where else
he might hang out?

10:10.110 --> 10:11.943
Actually, he told me
one time

10:11.945 --> 10:14.980
I should stay away from the lake
in Central Park.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.948
Did he say why?

10:16.950 --> 10:18.617
Yeah.

10:18.619 --> 10:21.886
It's CIA. Headquarters
in New York.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.054
Lemonhead.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.106
Got to be.

10:25.107 --> 10:27.157
'Cause his head
looks like a lemon.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.894
Does he have
a last name?

10:29.896 --> 10:30.929
Tyler.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.163
No, no, Taters.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.131
What?

10:33.133 --> 10:34.132
Taters.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.133
Lemonhead Taters?

10:35.135 --> 10:36.735
MAN:
Tatum.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.136
Christian Tatum.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.137
Drinking scotch.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.839
That's right.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.842
This doesn't look like
the scotch and soda crowd to me.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.777
Yeah, yeah, not too many
social drinkers

10:45.779 --> 10:47.779
sleeping in the park.

10:47.781 --> 10:51.683
Son of a bitch
wouldn't pass it around.

10:51.685 --> 10:52.751
He's selfish?

10:52.753 --> 10:54.219
He got up
in my face.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.121
He said he'd killed
one guy already

10:56.123 --> 10:57.889
and he'd do me two

10:57.891 --> 11:01.126
if I didn't get my hands
off of his booze.
That's RIGHT.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.160
You think he did?

11:02.162 --> 11:04.162
Kill a guy?

11:04.164 --> 11:06.031
Last week
he said he cut
the privates

11:06.033 --> 11:08.933
off somebody
from the CIA.

11:08.935 --> 11:12.037
Mm-hmm. You have any idea
where he is now?

11:12.039 --> 11:13.938
He had a meeting
with...

11:13.940 --> 11:15.173
what's his name?

11:15.175 --> 11:16.174
William Casey.

11:16.176 --> 11:20.779
Down at
the Dunsmore Arms.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.254
(<i> coughing )</i>

11:29.256 --> 11:32.290
What can I do for you?

11:32.292 --> 11:35.193
You know a guy by the name
of Christian Tatum?

11:35.195 --> 11:36.695
Yeah.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.930
Would you mind
pointing him out to us?

11:38.932 --> 11:41.232
He's not there.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.134
Try room 40.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.088
Mr. Tatum?

12:03.090 --> 12:05.090
Lemonhead!

12:05.092 --> 12:08.159
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.836
LOGAN:
Well, no lemonhead.

12:17.838 --> 12:21.106
But we got a red jacket.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.108
Torn pocket?

12:23.110 --> 12:24.275
Yep.

12:29.850 --> 12:30.849
CERRETA:
Hey!

12:30.851 --> 12:32.050
Hey!

12:36.323 --> 12:38.857
Are you
Christian Tatum?

12:38.859 --> 12:40.992
Answer me,
yes or no.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.127
Yep.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.129
You have the right
to remain silent

12:44.131 --> 12:45.930
and refuse to answer
any questions.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.516
Do you understand that?

12:48.517 --> 12:51.101
¶ Oh, the monkey wrapped
his tail around the flagpole ¶

12:51.104 --> 12:52.871
¶ 'Round the flagpole... ¶

12:52.873 --> 12:55.340
Take your time.

12:55.342 --> 12:59.844
I want the good-looking one--
bachelor number two.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.183
Number two,
step forward, please.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.321
A romantic weekend in Miami.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.290
All expenses paid.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.826
Get her
the hell out of here.

13:15.796 --> 13:19.130
Number two,
step back.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.168
Number four, step back.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.903
Earth
to number four!

13:24.905 --> 13:26.905
Step back.

13:27.908 --> 13:28.973
Step back.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.843
For the record,
I'd like it noted

13:31.845 --> 13:33.111
that your witness

13:33.113 --> 13:35.113
isn't exactly
grounded either.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.148
LOGAN:
So noted,
Miss Fahey.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.218
All right, Sal.

13:40.220 --> 13:43.254
Could you have them
turn around?

13:48.195 --> 13:54.032
Turn around
and face the rear.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.471
Number three.

14:00.473 --> 14:04.175
I never forget
a nice behind.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.944
Was he or was he not

14:05.946 --> 14:08.079
in the vicinity
of the stabbing?

14:08.081 --> 14:09.214
Well, no, but...

14:09.216 --> 14:10.882
Next.

14:12.219 --> 14:15.153
LOGAN:
Okay, you can
face forward.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.902
No.

14:30.904 --> 14:33.972
Are you sure?

14:33.974 --> 14:36.207
Absolutely.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.476
The one you saw
running away--

14:38.478 --> 14:41.112
the one
in the red parka?

14:41.114 --> 14:43.181
He's not there.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.219
Although...

14:48.221 --> 14:49.921
Yes?

14:52.926 --> 14:55.059
Number four.

14:58.531 --> 15:01.099
He was there, too.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.233
Too?

15:02.235 --> 15:04.202
Two guys.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.104
Two<i> different</i> guys.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.171
Yeah.

15:11.344 --> 15:15.079
What can you tell us
about the ring?

15:15.081 --> 15:18.082
When is Mr. Rehnquist
getting here?

15:18.084 --> 15:21.185
Oh, listen, he's caught up
in a Supreme Court thing.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.520
Hang tight.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.426
Miss Fahey.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.162
Crosstown traffic.
I'm sorry.

15:31.164 --> 15:34.098
We were just about
to extract a confession
from your client.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.100
Extract this, Logan.

15:37.337 --> 15:40.238
Miss Fahey's
a hell of a lawyer.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.307
You don't have
to say anything

15:42.309 --> 15:44.175
you don't want to.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.176
Don't worry.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.177
He hasn't.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.579
Uh, all right, Christian,

15:48.581 --> 15:51.049
your attorney is here now.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.584
So what
about it, hmm?

15:53.586 --> 15:55.386
Hmm?

15:57.057 --> 15:59.190
It was
in your jacket--

15:59.192 --> 16:00.992
the ring.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.540
It's not my jacket.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.542
You were wearing it.

16:17.544 --> 16:20.411
James put it over me.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.047
Would you explain that?

16:25.518 --> 16:31.022
I was safeguarding it
till I saw him again.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.224
Okay.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.493
You told your friends
in the park

16:35.495 --> 16:37.128
you stabbed a man.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.596
Was James in on that?

16:38.598 --> 16:42.166
You should know.

16:43.370 --> 16:47.271
But, uh, I don't know.

16:51.277 --> 16:53.544
I didn't stab anybody.

16:53.546 --> 16:56.180
James did.

16:56.182 --> 16:59.584
But I... helped him.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.325
How?

17:10.163 --> 17:12.430
I was a lookout.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.671
In your box?

17:20.673 --> 17:23.408
In my box.

17:29.115 --> 17:31.149
Problem?

17:31.151 --> 17:32.283
Maybe.

17:32.285 --> 17:35.119
Look, this other guy theory...

17:35.121 --> 17:38.289
I thought that was solid based
on the old lady with the dog.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.557
Yeah, Miss Hatch.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.492
But the second guy,
coming from Lemonhead,

17:41.494 --> 17:44.228
it sounds like a kid's
imaginary playmate.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.330
You know, "my friend James
who lives in the park"?

17:46.332 --> 17:47.565
Or outer space.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.168
Well, see if you can find out

17:50.170 --> 17:52.570
whether "friend James"
is real or not.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.239
If that doesn't work,
call Dr. Olivet.

17:56.709 --> 18:00.178
I didn't stab anybody.

18:00.180 --> 18:04.315
Well, you told your friends
in the park you did.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.086
That's for protection.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.187
Oh.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.289
You mean you made it up?

18:13.093 --> 18:15.159
Anything's possible.

18:18.098 --> 18:22.100
What about that CIA agent
last week?

18:22.102 --> 18:25.403
You told your friends
that you chopped off his...

18:25.405 --> 18:27.271
Stop that!

18:28.141 --> 18:29.407
Sorry.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.647
I've killed lots of people.

18:36.649 --> 18:39.183
Including Nathan Robbins?

18:54.734 --> 18:58.269
Word out is, there's a reward.

18:58.271 --> 19:02.306
I wouldn't know about that.

19:03.376 --> 19:06.177
You in a position to claim it?

19:06.179 --> 19:09.180
¶ Maybe yes, maybe no ¶

19:09.182 --> 19:13.317
¶ Anything is possible. ¶

19:15.221 --> 19:17.321
I know you don't want
to hear this,

19:17.323 --> 19:19.724
but I don't believe
he stabbed Robbins.

19:19.726 --> 19:22.460
You think
he's capable of it?

19:22.462 --> 19:25.229
He told me
he's killed 17 people,

19:25.231 --> 19:26.797
give or take a few.

19:26.799 --> 19:29.567
Well, so he exaggerates.

19:29.569 --> 19:30.801
He's delusional.

19:30.803 --> 19:33.538
He sees and hears things
that aren't there.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.673
He remembers things
that never happened.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.542
What about all the stuff

19:37.543 --> 19:39.410
with the red parka
and the imaginary homeboy?

19:39.412 --> 19:41.412
That sounds on the level.

19:41.414 --> 19:44.415
The way he described
wearing that red jacket--

19:44.417 --> 19:47.618
it's... it's like
a badge of honor with him.

19:47.620 --> 19:51.189
There is honor
among these people, you know.

19:51.191 --> 19:53.257
CRAGEN:
Fine. Great.
I'll accept that.

19:53.259 --> 19:56.694
So, what happened is,
he's a psychopath,

19:56.696 --> 19:58.729
and he thought
Robbins was attacking him

19:58.731 --> 20:00.598
when he started kicking his box,
so he comes out,

20:00.600 --> 20:01.832
flies into a rage.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.434
He's psychotic.

20:03.436 --> 20:04.802
He's not psychopathic.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.771
What's the difference?

20:06.773 --> 20:08.773
Psychotic
is when you believe

20:08.775 --> 20:10.775
the doorman was sent
from Planet X

20:10.777 --> 20:13.377
to put mind control devices
in your teeth.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.780
Psychopathic is when you
blow the doorman away

20:15.782 --> 20:17.782
and take out 20 other people
while you're at it.

20:17.784 --> 20:20.251
Now, come on,
you guys.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.420
You're making me late.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.656
And remember,
in a moment of lucidity,

20:25.658 --> 20:28.759
he told me James lives
under a big tree

20:28.761 --> 20:31.329
near the Bridle Path.

20:36.536 --> 20:39.870
And she said, she said,
"What about Tuesday?"

20:39.872 --> 20:43.741
And then she said,<i> you</i> said,
"What about Thursday?"

20:43.743 --> 20:44.875
(<i> chuckling</i> )

20:44.877 --> 20:47.478
And then she said,
she said,

20:47.480 --> 20:51.349
(<i> imitating sound of crowd ):</i>
"Da-ryl, da-ryl, da-ryl..."

20:51.351 --> 20:54.352
(<i> imitating announcer ):</i>
Security in section three,

20:54.354 --> 20:56.754
row 12, seat five-a,
seat five-a, seat...

20:56.756 --> 20:59.557
I want the reward.

20:59.559 --> 21:02.360
I thought this guy James
was your friend.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.630
I'm flexible.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.531
Crazy,
but not stupid.

21:07.533 --> 21:08.866
Yeah, okay, listen.

21:08.868 --> 21:11.869
You help us find James,
and he's guilty,

21:11.871 --> 21:13.838
you'll get your reward, okay?
How's that?

21:32.892 --> 21:34.592
(<i> chuckles</i> )

21:39.365 --> 21:40.831
CERRETA:
Well, somebody
lives here.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.333
Maybe you?

21:42.335 --> 21:43.601
James.

21:43.603 --> 21:44.902
I told you.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.342
Ugh!

22:01.821 --> 22:04.689
Oh. Aha.

22:04.691 --> 22:07.825
Social Services I.D.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.628
James Joseph Polesky.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.465
Good.

22:16.402 --> 22:19.804
Well, he's got 28 bucks
in a savings account

22:19.806 --> 22:22.340
at Manufacturers Hanover.

22:22.342 --> 22:26.410
Well, well, well,
what have we here?

22:28.981 --> 22:30.715
It's a match.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.850
Blood on the handle is B-neg.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.619
Chest hair, hair samples
match Robbins'.

22:35.621 --> 22:38.622
The size of the wound
is consistent.

22:38.624 --> 22:39.790
That's all?

22:39.792 --> 22:42.827
Would Polesky's prints
be overkill?

22:43.996 --> 22:49.400
CERRETA:
No. One thing I'm not really
clear on, Lem... Christian?

22:50.570 --> 22:52.002
If this was a robbery,

22:52.004 --> 22:53.604
then how come
your friend James

22:53.606 --> 22:55.673
didn't take
Mr. Robbins' wallet?

22:58.010 --> 23:00.010
He didn't see the wallet.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.912
He saw the ring.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.547
(<i> laughs</i> )

23:03.549 --> 23:04.782
If only he'd given James
what he wanted,

23:04.784 --> 23:06.684
then everything
would have been fine.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.486
CERRETA:
But he didn't
do that, huh?

23:08.488 --> 23:10.888
He held on to it.

23:10.890 --> 23:14.558
And then?

23:14.560 --> 23:16.827
And then
James stabbed him.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.502
Is that a yes?

23:24.504 --> 23:27.405
(<i> snickering</i> )

23:27.407 --> 23:28.639
FAHEY:
Christian?

23:32.779 --> 23:34.678
Yes, yes, yes.

23:36.783 --> 23:38.783
I think, uh...

23:38.785 --> 23:41.952
I'm going to get
an arrest warrant.

23:46.692 --> 23:48.826
CERRETA:
James J. Polesky!

23:48.828 --> 23:50.661
What's going on?
What's going on?

23:50.663 --> 23:52.830
I got him
Phil, you see him?

23:52.832 --> 23:54.498
Yeah.

23:54.500 --> 23:55.599
There he is!

23:57.637 --> 23:58.803
There he is!
Guys!

23:58.805 --> 24:00.838
You ain't going
anywhere.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.873
Get your hands
behind...!

24:02.875 --> 24:04.475
You're under arrest.

24:04.477 --> 24:06.577
You have the right
to remain silent

24:06.579 --> 24:08.813
and to refuse
to answer questions.

24:08.814 --> 24:11.048
Anything you do say
may be used against you
in a court of law.

24:13.085 --> 24:15.119
If we put you
in a lineup,

24:15.121 --> 24:17.488
we're gonna get
a positive make, James.

24:17.490 --> 24:20.958
So why don't you just
help yourself out, okay?

24:20.960 --> 24:23.127
Is there a deal
on the table?

24:23.129 --> 24:24.228
No.

24:24.230 --> 24:26.197
You want me
to sign this?

24:26.199 --> 24:27.699
Yes.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.200
Go pee up a rope.
(<i> chuckles )</i>

24:29.202 --> 24:32.670
I will, and then
I'm going to wrap it

24:32.672 --> 24:35.039
around your scrawny little neck.

24:35.041 --> 24:40.110
If this guy hits me,
I'm off the hook, right?

24:45.084 --> 24:47.017
We've got irrefutable physical
evidence,

24:47.019 --> 24:48.769
we've got an eyewitness.

24:48.770 --> 24:50.520
You tell me, why would I
want to make a deal?

24:50.523 --> 24:52.039
My client was drunk,

24:52.040 --> 24:53.556
and he has a history
of impulsiveness.

24:53.559 --> 24:57.161
If you can sell that to a jury,
try, Mr. Scoler,

24:57.163 --> 24:59.096
but I think they'll see it
as I do:

24:59.098 --> 25:02.266
an opportunistic,
cold-blooded killer.

25:02.268 --> 25:03.634
No deal.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.272
See you in court, then.

25:12.545 --> 25:14.612
He's going to turn this

25:14.614 --> 25:16.947
into a forum
on the rights of the homeless.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.649
So let him.
What's wrong with that?

25:18.651 --> 25:20.901
I'm seeing editorials
in my head--

25:20.902 --> 25:23.152
<i> "Power of state</i> v.<i> Victim of</i>
<i> Society, "</i> that kind of thing.

25:23.155 --> 25:24.989
We're going to get it
from the other side, too.

25:24.991 --> 25:27.091
"Homeless lunatics--
they kill innocent citizens.

25:27.093 --> 25:29.126
Is the State powerless
to protect us?"

25:29.128 --> 25:31.295
Let's stop worrying about the
ink we're getting, all right?

25:31.297 --> 25:33.998
I'm not, but the public's
perception of us.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
We could have made a deal,
saved a lot of bad feelings.

25:36.002 --> 25:38.202
I'm flexible on Lemonhead--
he's crazy--

25:38.204 --> 25:41.038
but Polesky, he killed a man
in cold blood,

25:41.040 --> 25:43.207
and homeless or not,
we get a conviction,

25:43.209 --> 25:45.042
the public will see us

25:45.044 --> 25:47.144
in a very kindly light,
believe me.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.246
The charge is murder
in the second degree.

25:49.248 --> 25:50.714
How does
the defendant plead?

25:50.716 --> 25:52.049
Not guilty, Your Honor.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.118
Do the People wish
to set bail?

25:54.120 --> 25:56.120
Mr. Polesky is a transient,
Your Honor.

25:56.122 --> 25:58.122
He has no ties to the community

25:58.124 --> 26:00.257
and given the viciousness
of this crime...

26:00.259 --> 26:02.993
JUDGE:
Bail is denied;
defendant is remanded.

26:02.995 --> 26:07.164
In the case
of<i> People</i> v. Christian Tatum,

26:07.166 --> 26:09.233
charge is murder
in the second degree,

26:09.235 --> 26:10.968
conspiracy and larceny.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.937
Your honor, the People
have turned nothing over to us.

26:12.939 --> 26:15.105
No bonds or disclosure forums,
no...

26:15.107 --> 26:16.640
JUDGE:
Mr. Robinette?

26:16.642 --> 26:19.310
The People were never asked
for V.D.F.s, Judge.

26:27.253 --> 26:31.622
Statement, witness I.D.,
arrest warrant...

26:31.624 --> 26:34.158
No search warrant?

26:38.230 --> 26:39.964
So, what happened?

26:39.966 --> 26:43.033
The judge had a problem
with no search warrant.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.134
Come on, Paul!

26:44.136 --> 26:46.237
We took him
where we found him.

26:46.238 --> 26:48.339
Look, I told him all that,
Mike. He didn't buy it.

26:48.341 --> 26:49.974
We were concerned
about securing the area,

26:49.976 --> 26:51.826
not worrying about
some search warrant.

26:51.827 --> 26:53.677
For all we knew,
that guy was in a closet
with a hunting knife.

26:53.679 --> 26:56.046
I understand.
I need one of you guys

26:56.048 --> 26:57.681
to testify
at the suppression hearing.

26:57.683 --> 26:59.249
I'll do it.

27:00.753 --> 27:02.219
As I was saying,

27:02.221 --> 27:05.222
the desk clerk directed us
to a vacant room.

27:05.224 --> 27:06.824
Lemonhead was not there.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.993
The jacket
was in plain sight...

27:08.995 --> 27:11.345
I understand, Detective.

27:11.346 --> 27:13.696
Nevertheless, I am going to
grant the motion to suppress

27:13.699 --> 27:16.700
on the illegal search
of the defendant's jacket.

27:16.702 --> 27:18.736
The ring belonging
to the victim

27:18.738 --> 27:21.138
is hereby ruled
inadmissible as evidence

27:21.140 --> 27:23.774
in<i> The People</i> v.
<i>Christian Tatum.</i>

27:26.212 --> 27:28.045
No ring, no case.

27:28.047 --> 27:31.181
I don't understand why
you're being so obstinate.

27:31.183 --> 27:33.717
I'm not allowed
to plea down that far.

27:33.719 --> 27:35.219
Besides, he confessed.

27:35.221 --> 27:37.221
The man's<i> non compos mentis.</i>

27:37.223 --> 27:39.040
There's no way he
understood his rights.

27:39.041 --> 27:40.858
Your client is
an accomplice to murder.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.127
How about
attempt rob two?

27:43.129 --> 27:45.630
Rob two.

27:45.631 --> 27:48.132
He testifies against Polesky,
he can get whatever help

27:48.134 --> 27:51.235
the system still has left
to offer him.

27:51.237 --> 27:53.404
All right. Deal.

27:53.406 --> 27:55.339
In writing.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.145
He was losing it.

28:01.147 --> 28:04.214
I thought I'd better
get him out of sight.

28:05.851 --> 28:08.185
Hello, Mr. Tatum.
(<i> gasps )</i>

28:08.187 --> 28:11.221
I saw James
out there.

28:11.223 --> 28:13.040
I saw him!

28:13.041 --> 28:14.858
You didn't tell me
James was gonna be here.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.161
James is the one
who's on trial, Mr. Tatum.

28:17.163 --> 28:18.896
Where do you think he'd be?

28:18.898 --> 28:21.732
Maybe I could, uh,
just get the reward

28:21.734 --> 28:24.201
and... and leave now, huh?

28:24.203 --> 28:26.370
James has a knife,
you know that.

28:26.372 --> 28:29.173
I don't want him to see me.

28:29.175 --> 28:32.142
James doesn't have the knife
anymore--  we have it.

28:32.144 --> 28:33.377
You just tell the court
what you saw James...

28:33.379 --> 28:35.145
He's going to kill me!
Don't you understand?

28:35.147 --> 28:36.880
He's going to slice me!

28:36.882 --> 28:39.883
He's going to feed me
to the pigeons!

28:39.885 --> 28:41.151
Quiet, okay?
Mr. Tatum...

28:41.153 --> 28:43.487
knock it off!

28:46.192 --> 28:47.224
Stand up.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.195
Your psychiatrist
tells me

28:51.197 --> 28:54.264
that you have moments
of rational thought.

28:54.266 --> 28:57.267
Now, we're going to go
back in there

28:57.269 --> 28:59.436
and we'll take care of you

28:59.438 --> 29:04.308
and<i> you</i> are going to have
one of those moments.

29:04.310 --> 29:09.213
Mr. Tatum,
were you offered a plea bargain

29:09.215 --> 29:14.218
in exchange
for today's testimony?

29:14.220 --> 29:15.486
Yes.

29:15.488 --> 29:18.455
And you have admitted
your part

29:18.457 --> 29:21.125
in the robbery
of Nathan Robbins.

29:21.127 --> 29:23.744
Is that correct?

29:23.745 --> 29:26.362
Yes, I was standing out front
of the coffee shop,

29:26.365 --> 29:30.234
looking for somebody to rob.

29:30.236 --> 29:31.802
Somebody easy.

29:31.804 --> 29:34.505
STONE:
Would you explain that?

29:34.507 --> 29:38.509
Well, somebody, you know,
who was drunk or high,

29:38.511 --> 29:41.945
you know, so they...
weren't thinking straight.

29:41.947 --> 29:45.182
Was this plan your idea?

29:45.184 --> 29:46.350
No.

29:46.352 --> 29:48.185
It was... was James'.

29:48.187 --> 29:51.255
Is James
in this courtroom?

29:57.229 --> 30:00.798
STONE:
Let the record indicate
that the witness is pointing

30:00.800 --> 30:03.967
at the defendant,
James Polesky.

30:03.969 --> 30:06.470
What was James doing the night

30:06.472 --> 30:07.871
of the murder?

30:07.873 --> 30:09.306
He was hanging out.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.875
I saw this guy and this girl.

30:11.877 --> 30:14.011
They... they...
weren't paying attention,

30:14.013 --> 30:18.515
so I go up to James--
"That's them."

30:18.517 --> 30:21.985
Then I went inside for a while.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.888
Inside
the cardboard box?

30:24.890 --> 30:28.592
Then I see James
going for the guy.

30:28.594 --> 30:31.495
And he went after him why?

30:31.497 --> 30:32.863
Well, the guy had a ring

30:32.865 --> 30:34.231
he wanted to give
to his girlfriend.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.238
Is this the ring?

30:43.209 --> 30:45.609
Your Honor,
I offer into evidence

30:45.611 --> 30:48.045
People's Exhibit
Number 25.

30:48.047 --> 30:49.046
Objection:
inadmissible.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.581
Sustained.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.516
Your Honor,
may we approach?

30:53.452 --> 30:57.020
This ring was suppressed
re<i> Tatum,</i> not...

30:57.022 --> 30:58.255
I'm well aware of that.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.324
I made the ruling.
Anything else?

31:00.326 --> 31:02.860
Then it's perfectly admissible
against Polesky.

31:02.862 --> 31:05.028
I'll make that determination,
Mr. Stone.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.331
Thank you, your witness.

31:14.273 --> 31:16.607
(<i> whispering ):</i>
<i> What an idiot.</i>

31:18.611 --> 31:21.278
Would you describe what happened

31:21.280 --> 31:24.548
after Mr. Polesky
approached Mr. Robbins?

31:26.085 --> 31:29.653
He pulled out his knife
and he pig-stuck him!

31:29.655 --> 31:31.021
(<i> wheezing laughter</i> )

31:31.023 --> 31:33.624
would you describe the knife,
please?

31:33.626 --> 31:35.592
Yeah!

31:35.594 --> 31:39.630
Like the one you showed me,
the one you got on the table.

31:41.267 --> 31:44.034
And then he pulled
the knife right out.

31:44.036 --> 31:46.670
No more questions
of this witness, Your Honor.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.975
Mr. Tatum.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.447
Has the CIA

31:57.449 --> 32:00.317
ever tried
to assassinate you?

32:05.958 --> 32:08.742
Yes.

32:08.743 --> 32:11.527
And when was the last attempt
on your life?

32:12.998 --> 32:14.564
Tuesday.

32:14.566 --> 32:15.933
Objection, Your Honor.

32:18.037 --> 32:22.940
SCOLER:
Now, why would the CIA
want to kill you, Mr. Tatum?

32:24.009 --> 32:26.343
Eastern Europe.

32:26.345 --> 32:30.580
I briefed Mikhail Gorbachev
several times last year

32:30.582 --> 32:32.950
before... it all happened.

32:32.952 --> 32:35.018
So you, um...

32:35.020 --> 32:37.020
you made them look bad.

32:37.022 --> 32:39.690
Yes. They don't like that.

32:39.692 --> 32:41.992
Thank you, Mr. Tatum.

32:43.395 --> 32:44.661
No further questions.

32:52.604 --> 32:54.972
How old are you,
Miss Hatch?

32:54.974 --> 32:56.673
Objection: relevance.

32:56.675 --> 32:58.442
Eyesight fades
as we grow older,
Your Honor.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.444
Overruled.

33:00.446 --> 33:02.179
SCOLER:
How<i> is</i> your eyesight,
Miss Hatch?

33:02.181 --> 33:05.382
I need glasses to read.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.451
Otherwise, it's fine.

33:07.453 --> 33:10.053
This is your sworn statement
to the police

33:10.055 --> 33:13.056
in which you claim
to have seen the defendant

33:13.058 --> 33:15.525
in from of Ezra's coffee shop.

33:15.527 --> 33:16.760
So?

33:16.762 --> 33:20.030
Do you see the same man
in court today?

33:24.770 --> 33:27.471
SCOLER:
I'm impressed.

33:27.473 --> 33:31.408
There's a mural behind me,
Miss Hatch.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.643
Will you describe it
for the court?

33:33.645 --> 33:37.147
Staten Island and the narrows.

33:40.152 --> 33:41.485
You're, uh...

33:41.487 --> 33:45.055
you're familiar
with the Staten Island

33:45.057 --> 33:47.057
of the 19th century, Miss Hatch?

33:47.059 --> 33:48.759
I can read the legend.

33:48.761 --> 33:51.161
I hope your eyesight

33:51.163 --> 33:53.597
is better than your manners,
young man.

33:57.603 --> 33:59.536
It was in the clearing
under a mattress

33:59.538 --> 34:01.104
where Mr. Polesky sleeps.

34:01.106 --> 34:03.106
What did you do
with the knife,
Sergeant?

34:03.108 --> 34:04.107
I bagged it

34:04.109 --> 34:05.776
and took it to the lab.

34:05.778 --> 34:08.245
STONE:
Did you read the lab report?

34:08.247 --> 34:10.714
Yes, of course. The blood
matched, the hair matched,

34:10.716 --> 34:12.783
and the size of the knife
was consistent with the wound.

34:12.785 --> 34:14.818
There were fingerprints
on the knife?

34:14.820 --> 34:17.788
One set--
those of the defendant.

34:17.790 --> 34:19.456
Thank you, Sergeant.

34:22.795 --> 34:24.795
Upon your conviction,

34:24.797 --> 34:27.798
of the crime of murder
in the second degree,

34:27.800 --> 34:30.467
the court sentences you to a
maximum term of imprisonment

34:30.469 --> 34:32.803
of 25 years to life.

34:32.805 --> 34:35.605
(<i> gavel bangs</i> )

34:39.845 --> 34:43.180
ROBINETTE:
Victim was assaulted
with a copper saucepan.

34:43.182 --> 34:44.848
STONE:
His wife?
A<i> sous</i> chef.

34:44.850 --> 34:49.152
The guy complained of too much
salt in the bechamel-- bam!

34:49.154 --> 34:51.788
Notice of appeal
on Polesky.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.794
Give me a break.

35:05.838 --> 35:09.106
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

35:09.108 --> 35:11.108
Everybody appeals everything.

35:11.110 --> 35:12.642
Why come way down
all the way down here?

35:12.644 --> 35:14.845
I just wanted to see
your faces.

35:14.847 --> 35:16.546
So what is it?

35:16.548 --> 35:19.583
The appeal is based on
the Fourth Amendment.

35:19.585 --> 35:21.218
You didn't have a warrant

35:21.220 --> 35:23.720
when you searched
the appellant's place of abode.

35:25.157 --> 35:27.124
Place of abode, huh?

35:27.126 --> 35:30.127
It was in the damn bushes.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.765
"...based on an illegal search

35:35.767 --> 35:40.337
of appellant's non-traditional
place of residence."

35:40.339 --> 35:42.439
Got to hand it to Scoler.

35:42.441 --> 35:44.207
That's pretty good.

35:44.209 --> 35:47.410
It wasn't Scoler.

35:47.412 --> 35:49.446
Norman Ackerman, ACLU.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.581
His brief in Skokie
was 120 pages.

35:51.583 --> 35:54.451
His buddies on Wall Street
do his research

35:54.453 --> 35:56.853
out of the goodness
of their hearts.

35:56.855 --> 35:59.289
Wall Street lawyers
doing<i> pro bono?</i>

35:59.291 --> 36:00.590
Makes them feel good.

36:00.592 --> 36:03.260
I don't care
who wrote the brief.

36:03.262 --> 36:06.429
No way the court can extend
Fourth Amendment protection

36:06.431 --> 36:08.231
to a bush in the park.

36:08.233 --> 36:09.299
Thought it was a shack.

36:09.301 --> 36:11.501
Makes their argument
more compelling.

36:11.503 --> 36:14.337
Actually, a cardboard box
in a clearing.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.389
The question is,

36:16.390 --> 36:18.440
can we take the temperature
of the appellate court?

36:18.443 --> 36:20.210
Well, the U.S. Supreme Court

36:20.212 --> 36:22.345
has gone pell-mell
to the right,

36:22.347 --> 36:24.347
and the local
magistrates

36:24.349 --> 36:27.918
haven't been
overly sympathetic
to the indigent,

36:27.920 --> 36:31.588
but the Manhattan
appellate judges

36:31.590 --> 36:34.858
may be the last
liberal activists

36:34.860 --> 36:37.227
sitting on any bench anywhere.

36:37.229 --> 36:39.329
Ackerman wrote
a hell of a brief,

36:39.331 --> 36:41.364
but case history
is on our side.

36:41.366 --> 36:42.866
That's encouraging.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.435
All the way back to 18th century
England. Blackstone.

36:45.437 --> 36:47.871
An open field
is not private property

36:47.873 --> 36:49.306
and is not protected.

36:49.308 --> 36:51.208
What's Ackerman
relying on?

36:51.210 --> 36:54.211
Sympathy and the 1967
Supreme Court decision,

36:54.213 --> 36:55.345
<i>Katz</i> v.<i> U.S.</i>

36:55.347 --> 36:57.297
The majority held

36:57.298 --> 36:59.248
that the police could not
tap a public phone

36:59.251 --> 37:00.417
without a warrant.

37:00.419 --> 37:01.551
"The Fourth Amendment

37:01.553 --> 37:03.353
protects people,
not places."

37:03.355 --> 37:05.989
I quoted Potter Stewart
in law school and won
an argument.

37:05.991 --> 37:07.290
but things change.

37:07.292 --> 37:08.925
Schiff may be right
about this court.

37:08.927 --> 37:11.394
The press says they're looking
to make a case.

37:11.396 --> 37:13.430
Mr. Polesky stabbed
an innocent victim

37:13.432 --> 37:14.931
for no other reason
than greed.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.600
This is the wrong case
to make a point, isn't it?

37:22.274 --> 37:24.407
(<i> reporters clamoring )</i>

37:24.409 --> 37:27.410
Mr. Stone, given the extent
of homelessness,

37:27.412 --> 37:29.279
don't you think the court
will jump at the chance

37:29.281 --> 37:31.131
to write new law
in this case?

37:31.132 --> 37:32.982
Homelessness may be the greatest
tragedy of our time,

37:32.985 --> 37:35.018
but I don't think the cure is
allowing a convicted felon

37:35.020 --> 37:36.320
to wander the streets,

37:36.321 --> 37:37.621
and I'm sure
the court will agree with me.

37:37.623 --> 37:39.289
You've got a tough job

37:39.291 --> 37:41.324
defending a patently
unconstitutional search.

37:41.326 --> 37:44.694
Nothing is patently anything
until the appeals court says so,

37:44.696 --> 37:47.564
and my job is to preserve
a solid murder conviction.

37:47.566 --> 37:50.400
Thank you.
REPORTER:
What about the rights
of the homeless?

37:55.307 --> 38:01.378
ROBINETTE:
The<i> Times</i> called Ackerman
the modern Clarence Darrow.

38:01.380 --> 38:04.447
I'm sure Darrow
had his off days.

38:07.319 --> 38:09.319
Ben.

38:09.321 --> 38:10.821
Oh, hi, Norman.

38:10.822 --> 38:12.322
It's been what, four,
five years.

38:12.324 --> 38:14.191
At least.

38:14.192 --> 38:16.059
You've stopped attending
our fund raiser.

38:16.061 --> 38:20.063
Defending the Nazis at Skokie
didn't sit right with me.

38:20.065 --> 38:23.466
Our only client is the U.S.
Constitution, you know that.

38:23.468 --> 38:26.036
In theory, but there are
practical consequences

38:26.038 --> 38:28.371
to every one of your crusades;
people get hurt-- real people.

38:28.373 --> 38:32.375
Ah. You don't want
the great unwashed
camping on your doorstep.

38:32.377 --> 38:34.711
Norman, this is about
James Polesky

38:34.713 --> 38:36.446
and, no, I don't want him

38:36.448 --> 38:38.615
hanging around my lobby
at night.

38:38.617 --> 38:41.351
ACKERMAN:
In<i> Katz,</i>
Mr. Justice Stewart wrote

38:41.353 --> 38:45.355
that "Whatever a person seeks
to preserve as private,

38:45.357 --> 38:48.325
"even in an area accessible
to the public,

38:48.327 --> 38:50.727
may be constitutionally
protected."

38:50.729 --> 38:54.331
The defendant here
did everything in his power

38:54.333 --> 38:56.099
to preserve his private space.

38:56.101 --> 38:58.001
JUDGE:
Excuse me, Mr. Ackerman,

38:58.003 --> 39:01.371
but the issue in<i> Katz</i>
was whether public telephones

39:01.373 --> 39:03.073
could be tapped
without a warrant.

39:03.075 --> 39:05.041
JUDGE #2:
And the same court in<i> Oliver</i>

39:05.043 --> 39:07.510
specifically refused to extend
Fourth Amendment protection

39:07.512 --> 39:08.945
to open fields.

39:08.947 --> 39:10.380
I'm well aware of<i> Oliver,</i>
Your Honor.

39:10.382 --> 39:12.515
But I'm also aware
that at that time

39:12.517 --> 39:15.051
of that decision, there weren't
a million homeless people

39:15.053 --> 39:16.619
wandering this country.

39:16.621 --> 39:18.088
JUDGE #3:
You would have us

39:18.090 --> 39:19.656
afford the same protection

39:19.658 --> 39:21.791
to a man
sleeping in Central Park

39:21.793 --> 39:24.661
as we would to a man
in the comfort of his home?

39:24.663 --> 39:27.030
Central Park<i> is</i> his home,
Your Honor.

39:27.032 --> 39:28.365
It is also

39:28.367 --> 39:30.767
public ground,
paid for by local taxes.

39:30.769 --> 39:33.069
The same taxes
that were supposed

39:33.071 --> 39:35.372
to build shelters
to house these people

39:35.374 --> 39:36.639
and hospitals
to care for them.

39:36.641 --> 39:39.509
Once the state abdicated

39:39.511 --> 39:42.379
its responsibility
to care for the homeless,

39:42.381 --> 39:46.750
the public parks, the alleys
and the streets

39:46.752 --> 39:48.551
became their homes.

39:48.553 --> 39:51.087
Just as we wouldn't allow

39:51.089 --> 39:53.490
governmental intrusion
into your bedrooms,

39:53.492 --> 39:55.024
we shouldn't allow intrusion

39:55.026 --> 39:56.426
into the private corner
of the world

39:56.428 --> 39:58.661
James Polesky calls home

39:58.663 --> 40:05.135
even if it is the dirt, bushes,
and rubble of Central Park.

40:05.137 --> 40:07.103
Thank you, Your Honors.

40:07.105 --> 40:09.572
Whether or not the state
is responsible

40:09.574 --> 40:10.840
for the homeless...

40:10.842 --> 40:12.842
Mr. Stone?
You don't think it is,

40:12.844 --> 40:15.445
What I think is not
at issue here.

40:15.447 --> 40:19.149
What is at issue is the scope
the Constitution affords.

40:19.151 --> 40:21.751
You don't think
it reaches Mr. Polesky?

40:21.753 --> 40:24.721
Balanced against
the People's interest

40:24.723 --> 40:28.024
in seeing a killer
put behind bars, no.

40:28.026 --> 40:29.559
Suppose it wasn't a knife

40:29.560 --> 40:31.093
found under that mattress,
Mr. Stone.

40:31.096 --> 40:35.698
Suppose it was Mr. Polesky's
personal diary.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.834
Should the police be allowed

40:37.836 --> 40:40.103
to invade
what is clearly private,

40:40.105 --> 40:43.139
or do only those
who can afford a home

40:43.141 --> 40:45.608
have the expectation of privacy?

40:45.610 --> 40:48.711
Mr. Justice Harlan wrote in his
concurring opinion on<i> Katz</i>

40:48.713 --> 40:51.581
that the expectation of privacy
must be one

40:51.583 --> 40:55.118
that society is prepared
to recognize as reasonable.

40:55.120 --> 40:58.521
And it's your position that
society would be unreasonable

40:58.523 --> 40:59.756
in allowing the defendant

40:59.758 --> 41:01.858
to call a dirty mattress
his home?

41:01.860 --> 41:04.561
One of the attributes
of private property

41:04.563 --> 41:06.596
is the right to exclude others.

41:06.598 --> 41:08.131
And Mr. Polesky cannot exclude
others from his home

41:08.133 --> 41:10.099
since his home is
by definition public property.

41:10.101 --> 41:12.669
Really, Councelor,
would it have been so difficult

41:12.671 --> 41:14.537
for the police
to obtain a warrant?

41:14.539 --> 41:17.240
GREEN:
Thank you,
Mr. Stone.

41:21.913 --> 41:23.213
No, I can't say

41:23.215 --> 41:25.849
that I'm at all surprised
by the decision.

41:25.851 --> 41:28.551
Mr. Ackerman, will your victory
affect the problem
of the homeless?

41:28.553 --> 41:29.686
Wait a second.

41:29.688 --> 41:31.554
This is not my victory.

41:31.556 --> 41:33.873
It is a victory

41:33.874 --> 41:36.191
for the Constitution
of the United States.

41:36.194 --> 41:37.560
The opinion is good.

41:37.562 --> 41:40.096
There was nothing
you could have done.

41:40.098 --> 41:42.832
The court was predisposed
against it.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.235
Still, we got
a three-two decision.

41:45.237 --> 41:47.837
I thought the Constitution
was supposed protect society.

41:47.839 --> 41:50.673
And the rights of individuals;
sometimes they clash.

41:50.675 --> 41:53.676
It's a sad commentary, isn't it?
It's as if the court is saying

41:53.678 --> 41:55.512
you have a right
to a wretched existence.

41:55.514 --> 41:57.180
What are you going to do?

41:57.182 --> 41:58.781
We could appeal
to Albany, but...

41:58.783 --> 42:00.550
What about a retrial?

42:00.552 --> 42:02.819
Without the murder weapon,
we ain't got a prayer.

42:02.821 --> 42:04.554
We still have the ring.

42:04.556 --> 42:06.656
O'Malley excluded it,
remember?

42:06.658 --> 42:08.224
I know, and he's
still wrong about it.

42:08.226 --> 42:10.126
Polesky has no standing

42:10.128 --> 42:12.295
to challenge the warrant
??seizure of the parka.

42:12.297 --> 42:15.565
I cannot believe how O'Malley
have been so out to lunch?

42:15.567 --> 42:18.234
You think you can engineer
a change of heart?

42:18.236 --> 42:19.769
If not mind.

42:19.771 --> 42:20.737
I'll handle it.

42:20.739 --> 42:21.838
New trial.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.239
Lemonhead testifies

42:23.241 --> 42:25.875
that he got the ring
from Polesky and...

42:25.877 --> 42:27.744
It's circumstantial,
but it should be enough.

42:27.746 --> 42:30.179
If we find Lemonhead.

42:36.988 --> 42:40.723
(<i> man mumbling</i> )

42:41.726 --> 42:46.963
(<i> mumbling )</i>

42:46.965 --> 42:49.699
FBI.

42:49.701 --> 42:51.234
CIA.

42:51.236 --> 42:55.004
MAN:
Yesterday he was screaming
for his lawyer.

42:55.006 --> 42:57.640
Something
about<i> habeas corpus.</i>

42:57.642 --> 42:58.908
What the hell is that?

42:58.910 --> 43:01.978
It means you can't hold him
against his will.

43:01.980 --> 43:05.949
Every nut case
has his day in court,
I guess.

43:05.951 --> 43:08.284
I guess.

43:08.286 --> 43:11.287
ROBINETTE:
I doubt he even knows
his own name.

43:11.289 --> 43:13.756
No way we can
put him on the stand.

43:13.758 --> 43:15.592
He was competent the first time.

43:15.594 --> 43:16.960
I saw him, Ben.

43:16.962 --> 43:19.262
Believe me, it's over.

43:19.264 --> 43:22.932
Maybe Olivet
can snap him out of it.

43:24.369 --> 43:26.736
You got my message?

43:26.738 --> 43:27.837
Yes.

43:27.839 --> 43:29.238
You saw Lemonhead?

43:29.240 --> 43:30.907
I saw Christian Tatum.

43:30.909 --> 43:32.241
We didn't...

43:32.243 --> 43:34.978
It wasn't much
of a conversation.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.714
I know the man's in trouble...

43:37.716 --> 43:39.382
The man's on anti-psychotics,
did you know that?

43:39.384 --> 43:42.785
Which leaves him nauseous,
listing to one side

43:42.787 --> 43:44.988
and in danger of choking
to death on his own tongue.

43:44.990 --> 43:47.991
I feel sorry
for Mr. Tatum's condition,

43:47.993 --> 43:51.394
but his testimony is crucial,
and what I need to know from you

43:51.396 --> 43:53.363
is, will he be able
to take the stand

43:53.365 --> 43:54.831
for just a few minutes?

43:54.833 --> 43:57.634
Will he be able
to say a simple yes or no?

43:57.636 --> 43:59.953
Nothing is that simple.

43:59.954 --> 44:02.271
Last time he was in the court,
he was terrified of James,

44:02.273 --> 44:04.007
and you pushed him
into taking the stand.

44:04.009 --> 44:05.808
Now wait a minute. I pushed him
into telling the truth

44:05.810 --> 44:08.411
in a murder trial
in which he entered
into a plea bargain.

44:08.413 --> 44:10.079
He may be
on some other planet, Ben,

44:10.081 --> 44:11.814
but the guy's hurting,

44:11.816 --> 44:14.283
and I don't think
he can survive
another circus.

44:17.355 --> 44:20.323
You asked for my opinion.

44:22.961 --> 44:25.028
I understand.

44:28.967 --> 44:31.701
Did you read the People's
bench memo, Your Honor?

44:31.703 --> 44:32.969
I did.

44:32.971 --> 44:35.472
And?

44:35.473 --> 44:37.974
You're right. I was in error
in excluding the ring.

44:37.976 --> 44:40.376
Getting back to the
issue at hand, Judge,

44:40.378 --> 44:42.945
the Sixth Amendment
guarantees my client

44:42.947 --> 44:46.382
the right to confront
all witnesses against him.

44:46.384 --> 44:47.850
Mr. Stone?

44:47.852 --> 44:50.853
"Testimony given by a witness
at a prior trial

44:50.855 --> 44:52.855
"may be received into evidence

44:52.857 --> 44:54.957
"when the witness
is unable to attend

44:54.959 --> 44:57.894
by reason of death,
illness or incapacity."

44:57.896 --> 44:59.429
C.P.L., Article 670.

44:59.431 --> 45:01.097
And your witness
is incapacitated?

45:01.099 --> 45:04.867
He's institutionalized,
Your Honor.

45:04.869 --> 45:06.869
He's psychotic.

45:06.870 --> 45:08.870
His testimony in court
was practically hallucinatory.

45:08.873 --> 45:11.374
He was competent then
and as you recall,

45:11.376 --> 45:14.410
Mr. Scoler made no objection
to his testifying at the time.

45:14.412 --> 45:16.713
I'm going to grant
Mr. Stone's motion.

45:16.715 --> 45:18.748
Mr. Tatum's prior testimony

45:18.750 --> 45:20.149
will be read
into evidence.

45:20.151 --> 45:22.018
Your objection

45:22.019 --> 45:23.886
is duly noted for
the record, Mr. Scoler.

45:23.888 --> 45:25.988
Feel free to have another go
with the five wise men uptown

45:25.990 --> 45:28.024
if you like.

45:28.026 --> 45:31.060
I'm thinking... man two.

45:31.062 --> 45:33.362
I'm thinking murder two.

45:33.364 --> 45:34.931
He gets 25 to life.

45:34.933 --> 45:36.065
I'll appeal.

45:36.067 --> 45:37.834
We'll start over.

45:37.836 --> 45:39.068
I'll be here.

45:40.371 --> 45:41.904
Manslaughter one.

45:41.906 --> 45:45.141
All right,
but Mr. Polesky does the max.

45:45.143 --> 45:47.076
My client
won't be very happy,

45:47.078 --> 45:49.846
but at least he'll have
a roof over his head

45:49.848 --> 45:51.347
for the next 25 years.

45:51.349 --> 45:54.517
So does Lemonhead--
a rubber cell at Bellevue.

45:54.519 --> 45:56.486
And then
there's Nathan Robbins.

45:56.488 --> 45:58.121
He's got six feet of dirt
over his head.

45:58.123 --> 46:01.023
So what's happy
got to do with it?
