WEBVTT

00:02.569 --> 00:06.238
- I gotta make a change,
like a big change

00:06.307 --> 00:09.707
'cause I'm single--it's fine--
I'm over 40, and I'm soon to be

00:09.744 --> 00:11.844
An empty nester.
So I just gotta make

00:11.979 --> 00:13.445
A bold move.

00:14.648 --> 00:16.181
Yep, I'm gonna cut my hair.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.883
You're probably
one of those guys that thinks,

00:18.018 --> 00:19.651
"oh yeah, all women
should have long hair,"

00:19.687 --> 00:21.720
But guess what, honey,
you get to a certain age,

00:21.855 --> 00:24.857
And women, they do not care.
They do not care what you think.

00:24.992 --> 00:27.026
Long hair--top tip--
it drags your face down,

00:27.161 --> 00:29.728
It gets all up in your mouth,
you know. You have no idea

00:29.863 --> 00:32.397
What it's like
chewing your own hair.

00:32.466 --> 00:35.200
The strange thing is though,
you know, when I was a kid,

00:35.335 --> 00:37.402
I used to chew on my hair
all the time, I didn't think
it was disgusting at all.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.338
Ok, I have a theory.
Hair attached to your head

00:39.473 --> 00:41.273
Is just not as disgusting
as hair detached from your head.

00:41.342 --> 00:44.009
Because if a hair attached
to your head gets in your mouth,

00:44.011 --> 00:46.078
You're like, prtt! What? I don't
care. Is that even there?

00:46.147 --> 00:48.613
Would you ever take
a wad of hair from a brush?

00:48.649 --> 00:50.349
It could be your hair.
- (man): Stop talking.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.417
- Your lover's hair. A dog hair.
Could be a pubic hair in there.

00:52.453 --> 00:55.020
- Stop talking! Stop talking!
- Would you eat it? No.

00:55.155 --> 00:57.422
Ok, fine. It's just my--
- please. I don't want to get

00:57.425 --> 00:59.958
In the way of your equal rights
here, but trust me,

00:59.960 --> 01:02.761
I happen to like a woman
with a hairy armpit,

01:02.896 --> 01:05.564
Ok, but long hair on a lady
makes them seem,

01:05.633 --> 01:07.566
Oh, I don't know,
more attractive.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.368
- What?!
- Did you bring coffee?

01:09.503 --> 01:11.470
- Obviously. Here.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.838
- Look at miss piggy.
- Ok.

01:13.874 --> 01:17.675
- She was a pig but that hair...
(chuckling)

01:20.180 --> 01:21.847
- Ok, ok,
eyes on the seller.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.248
Look at this.
Same time, same bench.

01:23.383 --> 01:26.518
- Makes our job easier.
(funky music)

01:30.924 --> 01:33.025
- Ok. Here we go.

01:33.027 --> 01:34.993
Ten bucks says
that's his runner.

01:35.029 --> 01:38.697
Why aren't you in school,
young man?

01:38.699 --> 01:41.400
(camera clicking)
(woman speaking indistinctly)

01:41.535 --> 01:44.002
What's this now?
- (man): What's she doing?
Get out of there!

01:44.038 --> 01:45.237
- Uh-oh!

01:45.372 --> 01:47.906
- You shopping
at the fresh farm. I know

01:47.908 --> 01:49.942
You got a little extra change
in those pockets.

01:49.944 --> 01:52.277
Come on! Come on!
A little extra change, please?

01:52.279 --> 01:54.413
- Alright, yeah. Extra change
here. Take it, get out of here.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.148

I'm talking about!

Listen, I am so sorry to

05:03.270 --> 05:05.069
With rafi bowen,
but on the bright side,

05:05.105 --> 05:07.005
You and I, we're gonna get
a chance to talk.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.407
- Who's rafi?
- Rafi, the youngest

05:09.543 --> 05:11.509
Of the three bowen brothers.
Stock was named

05:11.545 --> 05:14.245
Back then for the narcotic
known as cocaine.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.116
Which I specialize in.
- I was just meeting a friend.

05:18.185 --> 05:20.652
- Detective duff, it's ok.
You know what? I have got this.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.889
Um, mr. Dubman,
let's get real.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.891
You are a member
of the stockwood crew.
- I'm not part of any crew.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.559
- And how about "gang"?
Is that better?

05:28.595 --> 05:30.662
A network of associates
who make their money

05:30.664 --> 05:33.165
By conducting illegal activity,
which constitutes

05:33.300 --> 05:35.767
A gang in my eyes. My eyes
being all the eyes that matter.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.435
- For the record,
my eyes also matter,

05:37.471 --> 05:38.936
And I was thinking--
- here's what I'm thinking.

05:40.974 --> 05:43.709
Thank you.
There's a bunch of fish

05:43.844 --> 05:45.644
In the stockwood pond.
There's big fish,

05:45.779 --> 05:47.979
There's small fish. There's
piranhas and there's guppies.

05:47.981 --> 05:50.515
These are the piranhas,
the bowen brothers.

05:50.650 --> 05:53.251
Randy bowen, steph bowen.
- Piranhas aren't big fish;

05:53.287 --> 05:55.654
They're actually small fish.
- But they are ferocious though.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.656
Even more so
because they swim in schools,

05:57.791 --> 06:00.125
Otherwise known as gangs.
- If you want to get technical,

06:00.194 --> 06:03.128
Gang is called a shoal.
- I'm an expert on fishing.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.197
I grew up visiting
my uncle travis on lake simcoe,

06:05.199 --> 06:07.265
And, believe me, I have spent
many an hour on a lake.

06:07.334 --> 06:09.401
- Mm-hmm. Obviously
not catching piranhas.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.137
- Correct. I was catching
smelts. Are you a smelt, davis?

06:12.139 --> 06:13.939
- I'm cool
with piranha actually.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.807
- Yeah, of course you are 'cause
you think you're a tough guy,

06:15.942 --> 06:18.176
But too bad, you are a guppy.
And what I want to know is

06:18.245 --> 06:21.346
Who is the shark? And my money
is on steph bowen. Am I right?

06:21.481 --> 06:23.181
- See? When we "caught" you,

06:23.183 --> 06:25.016
You went from--
- guppy to fish food.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.217
Now you're gonna go to prison
where a shoal of piranhas

06:26.286 --> 06:28.753
Are gonna eat you alive.
Either way, ta-da!

06:28.822 --> 06:30.288
I am the fisherwoman,
I am throwing you a worm.

06:30.324 --> 06:31.756
You work with us to get
the bowens off the street,

06:31.792 --> 06:33.625

secretly fudging the rules.

In this day and age, we need
to forego the grey zone.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.835
We have to lean
into those rules.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.170

ring any bells?

This banana?
- I guess, technically god

08:17.264 --> 08:19.797
Or a god made the banana.
- Isn't that adorable.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.733

god made the banana.

31:39.932 --> 31:41.731
Shot to the head
probably shouldn't be

31:41.767 --> 31:43.700
Our strategy.
- Yeah. Remember that seminar

31:43.835 --> 31:45.402
We went to?
Old school versus new school?

31:45.537 --> 31:48.472
- Fine. Fine! We'll do it
the boring way, alright?

31:48.474 --> 31:50.807
We'll put this narco in
to stay close to the girl,

31:50.876 --> 31:53.944
And we'll just wait
for rafi to show up.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.946
- So, do we have a plan or not?
- Yes, ma'am!

31:55.948 --> 31:57.747
- I got a plan.
- I have got the plan.

31:57.816 --> 31:59.615
- Obama, you're driving.

32:00.686 --> 32:02.686
- Let's...

32:05.123 --> 32:07.357
- No, don't take the gardiner
this time of day,
take lakeshore.

32:07.492 --> 32:09.826
(cell phone ringing)
- hey, it's elliott.

32:09.962 --> 32:11.695
Could you grab it, please?
- Excuse me?

32:11.697 --> 32:13.697
- Please. I said please.

32:13.699 --> 32:15.698

Hey, sweetie, what's up?
(duff growling)

32:19.538 --> 32:21.104
- [hi, mom.
Don't freak out, ok?]

32:21.106 --> 32:23.106
- Ok, go on.
- [I... I got jumped.]

32:23.241 --> 32:25.208
[totally not my fault,
but you gotta come.]

32:25.210 --> 32:27.210
- Ok, where are you?
- [I'm at school.]

32:27.246 --> 32:29.713
[I'm with the... The principal.]
(tires screeching)

32:29.782 --> 32:31.782
- Whoa, what the hell, woman?!

32:31.917 --> 32:33.784
- I will be right there.
- It is 4 o'clock;

32:33.786 --> 32:35.651
We gotta be in place by 6!
- You know what?

32:35.688 --> 32:37.354
You were right,
the driver is in control.

32:46.465 --> 32:47.998
- He sounded fine on the phone.
I don't know

32:48.067 --> 32:49.932
Why you're panicking.
- Because he's my son

32:49.969 --> 32:52.001
And he got jumped. Ok?
- Can't the dad deal with this?

32:52.037 --> 32:54.071
- Oh, is that what dads do?
Sweep in like heroes when

32:54.206 --> 32:56.940
There's trouble? Why don't you
show me one of those fancy dads.

32:57.075 --> 32:59.275
- I take it your divorce
didn't go smoothly.

32:59.277 --> 33:01.577
- Marriage didn't
go smoothly.

33:02.982 --> 33:05.348
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

33:05.351 --> 33:07.484
Elliot...
- It's two-day suspension

33:07.553 --> 33:09.953
For this guy.
- No, no. No, he was jumped!

33:09.955 --> 33:12.756
- Ok. Well, mom, look, this guy
was a total asshole, right?

33:12.891 --> 33:14.891
- No. No. He got
into a fight.

33:14.893 --> 33:18.095
It sounds like
tyler fantino paid elliott

33:18.230 --> 33:20.230
$300 for a pair of sneakers

33:20.299 --> 33:22.866
And never received
said sneakers.

33:22.868 --> 33:25.235
So, they got into it.
- That sounds really terrible.

33:25.304 --> 33:29.372
Listen, is there anything
we can do about the suspension?

33:29.441 --> 33:31.641
It's just that this year
is so important

33:31.643 --> 33:33.110
For elliot's college future.

33:33.245 --> 33:35.045
- Ah, so it's
miss I-don't-break-the-rules

33:35.180 --> 33:36.713
Until my son gets involved.

33:36.715 --> 33:39.149
- I'm sorry,
who are you?

33:39.218 --> 33:40.684
- This is my colleague.
- Kelly duff.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.218
- Fine! Do you know what? Fine!
- Detective...

33:42.254 --> 33:44.387
- The suspension holds,
but could you please send me

33:44.390 --> 33:46.356
Tyler's contact details
because I'm going

33:46.358 --> 33:48.658
To e-transfer the money out
of elliott's savings account,

33:48.694 --> 33:50.726
Ok? Elliott...
- Thank god.

33:50.763 --> 33:53.396
- I want you to go
straight home.
- Yo.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.331
Look, he deserved it, ok?
I mean, he did the same thing

33:55.367 --> 33:57.134
To a bunch of my friends.
- Two wrongs don't make a right.

33:57.269 --> 34:00.003
- Look, I was levelling, ok?
I shouldn't be suspended
for that.

34:00.138 --> 34:02.539
- So your kid wants $300
and his sneakers?

34:02.608 --> 34:04.407
Are you kidding?

34:04.443 --> 34:06.542
We done.
- It isn't on you to level,

34:06.578 --> 34:08.812
And did I pay for that shirt?
- Uh, no.

34:08.814 --> 34:10.947
But yo, can I have,
like, $20 for food?

34:10.949 --> 34:12.682
I didn't get lunch.

- "cheesed"?

35:08.474 --> 35:10.874
- Likely derived from
the cheese-making process.
It's when the milk sours--

You'll be alright.

38:49.961 --> 38:52.395

years. I knew he had secrets,

38:52.464 --> 38:54.898
But I just thought
it was another woman.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.432
- Is rick a part
of your trucking company?

38:56.568 --> 38:58.468

- Already looking into that one.
- Go ahead.

39:02.207 --> 39:04.741
She could have a record?

No, no, no.
Elliott, that's not what we--

I didn't know he was your--
- you knew rafi was dealing.

Goddammit, jackie,
who needs you anyway?

40:01.466 --> 40:03.632

40:05.203 --> 40:07.837
Otherwise, my company would be
tits up by now!

Then you go and blow it all up

on a goddamn plate!

40:11.009 --> 40:12.842
- Yeah. Because I would have
been arrested

41:58.416 --> 42:00.617
- Get out of here!
(keegan laughing)

42:00.752 --> 42:03.419
- Oh! And, uh...
This youth program thing,

42:03.421 --> 42:05.288
I don't know
what we're gonna do.

42:07.158 --> 42:09.925
They said I can't run it
until I'm clear.

42:12.664 --> 42:14.497
- Alright, it's fine.

42:14.632 --> 42:16.499
You know what?
I'll run it for now.

42:16.568 --> 42:18.133
- Thank you.

42:20.138 --> 42:22.572
You are such a wuss!

42:22.707 --> 42:24.840
- Shut up!
(keegan laughing)

42:26.111 --> 42:29.111
- I got your back here.
- Thanks.

42:29.147 --> 42:30.713
- And listen,

42:30.715 --> 42:33.917
When they do finally
give me my job back,

42:34.052 --> 42:35.851
You can't abandon me, ok?

42:39.124 --> 42:40.790
- No. Of course not.

42:42.527 --> 42:44.794
You gotta dance with the one
who "brung" you in, right?

42:46.798 --> 42:48.931
- That's right.

42:48.967 --> 42:52.268
