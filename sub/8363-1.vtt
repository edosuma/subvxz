04:07.847 --> 04:08.996
Happy Birthday, Princess!

04:12.527 --> 04:13.642
Is this for me?

04:14.247 --> 04:15.521
Certainly, Princess.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.524
It's for you.
Here.

04:20.966 --> 04:22.639
Congratulations... and Happy Birthday.

04:23.887 --> 04:24.922
Thank you.

04:25.127 --> 04:26.321
Where did you get it?

04:26.607 --> 04:28.086
What a nice bicycle!

04:29.207 --> 04:30.481
Yes it's fantastic,

04:31.007 --> 04:33.646
And it has a basket, side pockets,
and it's 18 speed.

04:34.527 --> 04:36.483
These friends of yours,
who are they?

04:37.607 --> 04:39.359
They help me with stuff, mom.

04:39.607 --> 04:40.756
Yeah? What stuff?

04:42.527 --> 04:43.960
Answer me, what kind of stuff?

04:47.327 --> 04:48.442
Why!

04:49.927 --> 04:53.044
We take tourist on tours around the city,
I do it in english.

04:54.007 --> 04:55.007
What else?

04:55.247 --> 04:56.600
I got many brains!

04:58.247 --> 04:59.566
Later, Princess.

05:00.287 --> 05:02.357
All right, come with me,
and I'll show you around.

05:03.447 --> 05:06.166
No, it's too dangerous,
with all these foreigners.

05:06.447 --> 05:07.926
Why do you act like this?

05:08.647 --> 05:10.603
Mom, I bought it, it's paid for.

05:11.127 --> 05:14.403
Why can't you behave,
like your sister for an example..

05:14.607 --> 05:19.679
You wouldn't talk to me like this,
if your father was here.

05:20.007 --> 05:21.326
Well he's not here!

05:28.487 --> 05:29.522
Be back later, mom.

05:30.487 --> 05:33.126
Will you be back later today to spend the night?

05:33.527 --> 05:35.916
You will be back later, no?

05:38.047 --> 05:40.242
You can't use this bike, I forbid it.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.840
Why not?
The Lord created bicycles for this purpose.

05:44.087 --> 05:47.238
The Lord did not create bicycles,
and I wont let you ride it!

05:52.367 --> 05:54.358
Time is money, my friends!
I got to run!

06:06.767 --> 06:09.122
My name is Veronica.
How are you?

06:10.407 --> 06:11.476
And?

06:13.447 --> 06:15.199
I am happy to be here.

06:15.527 --> 06:17.995
That's real good, you're getting better.

06:26.807 --> 06:28.007
Welcome to Mexico city.

06:28.008 --> 06:29.042
Thanks you.

06:29.207 --> 06:30.242
Attention please!

06:30.487 --> 06:34.526
Passenger Ramona Lopez, please go
to the nearest pager phone...

06:35.007 --> 06:36.406
Is this it?

06:36.727 --> 06:39.001
Ok. Girls let's go.
This way

06:43.367 --> 06:47.443
Girls, this is Vadim Yochenko
head of the Agency

06:47.527 --> 06:49.597
And this is...
- Manuel

06:49.927 --> 06:51.918
Manuel.
He will be escorting you to Los Angeles.

06:52.127 --> 06:54.401
Welcome to Mexico.

06:55.527 --> 06:58.040
What a pretty smile.

07:00.167 --> 07:03.556
Let's go, we'll talk in the car.

07:06.087 --> 07:08.806
Oh I forgot... can I get your passports please.

07:11.167 --> 07:14.318
It's ok.
Thanks you.

07:16.007 --> 07:18.360
Excuse me, but there's something wrong?

07:18.487 --> 07:20.522
What's wrong?

07:20.767 --> 07:24.802
The passports.

07:25.087 --> 07:28.682
Forgive me, but why have you taken our passports?

07:29.327 --> 07:30.521
Visas.

07:32.087 --> 07:33.884
But we already have visas.

07:38.007 --> 07:42.762
Shut up, don't forget we know where your parents live,
and we also know about your little son.

08:20.487 --> 08:24.320
Hey! What's up my friend?
You're alone?

08:24.427 --> 08:27.702
I can show you around,
museum of fertility?

08:27.807 --> 08:29.340
No thank's... I'm cool

08:29.387 --> 08:30.087
What?

08:30.127 --> 08:32.240
Mui... cool... suave?

08:32.246 --> 08:35.938
Hey! But you got to take a look Mr. Cool.
Look, just look.

08:36.327 --> 08:39.080
Please, look... look... just a second.

08:39.327 --> 08:42.520
Here... please

08:43.607 --> 08:46.357
You want a true Mexican experience?

08:47.327 --> 08:50.521
We got treasures that look better
than these fucking pyramids.

08:52.047 --> 08:54.800
Your dollars will go a long long way down here.

08:55.727 --> 08:58.321
The one on the left there
- Rosita, La Ra Rosita.

08:59.007 --> 09:03.363
She's first class,
she gives real good head.

09:11.247 --> 09:15.559
Come on!
We're close.

09:27.527 --> 09:30.758
Forgive me my friend, you wont get
to taste today any Mexican pussy.

09:31.287 --> 09:32.402
Don't kill me.

09:32.607 --> 09:36.680
Yes sir you'll be giving us everything, ok.

09:36.887 --> 09:39.957
You know what, if I was you?
I bet you hate all Mexicans right now.

09:40.847 --> 09:45.443
Guys, what do we do to Gringos?
Who disrespect the Mexicans?

09:48.487 --> 09:49.715
Show him!

09:52.967 --> 09:54.480
Die bitch.

10:42.367 --> 10:44.403
Down with Americans, America sucks!

10:48.727 --> 10:51.002
To my brother with love, from Adriana.

12:19.927 --> 12:22.600
No! No! No!

12:41.687 --> 12:43.120
Look's like they're enjoying themselves.

12:44.007 --> 12:45.360
You're not kidding!

12:48.127 --> 12:50.402
Hey!
This bicycle looks familiar.

12:52.127 --> 12:55.516
Hey! Hey...
stop!

13:00.047 --> 13:01.799
What's the matter?
What's going on?

13:04.327 --> 13:05.396
What's the matter?

13:09.287 --> 13:12.482
Hey you, son of a bitch,
you stole my sister bicycle.

13:12.487 --> 13:13.881
No! I found it in the street!

13:13.887 --> 13:15.202
Tell that to your mother!

13:15.447 --> 13:16.596
Really!
Really!

13:16.807 --> 13:17.842
I found it,
believe me!

13:18.167 --> 13:19.395
Alright!
Alright!

13:19.767 --> 13:21.995
I'll show you where I found it!

13:22.167 --> 13:24.395
Let's go!
Hurry up move! Faster!

13:30.167 --> 13:31.486
Show me where you found it?

13:31.767 --> 13:33.882
Right there.

13:48.867 --> 13:50.882
Hey!

14:17.167 --> 14:18.236
Hey!
Where you going?

14:18.487 --> 14:20.159
Jorge, what are you doing?
That was my sisters!

14:22.207 --> 14:23.720
Why?, why?

14:26.167 --> 14:28.078
Did you see the girl on the bicycle?

14:28.567 --> 14:31.320
My son is a sleep, and I can't...
God help you.

14:32.367 --> 14:36.121
Nobody saw a damn thing,
it's time to go and see Don Victor.

14:39.007 --> 14:40.326
Let's go!

14:48.767 --> 14:51.076
If she was taken in this part of city,
it means the Russian took her.

14:51.487 --> 14:52.966
Russian?

14:53.207 --> 14:54.322
They're animals.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.438
They buy and sell anything
they get there hands on.

14:57.727 --> 14:59.797
A pretty girl, like your sister,
it's very possible,

15:00.047 --> 15:02.436
And for them a virgin...
is solid gold.

15:04.607 --> 15:08.066
She's only 13, Don Victor.
Please tell me, where I can find her!

15:08.087 --> 15:10.520
Help me please!
With the Russian?

15:10.527 --> 15:12.042
They're everywhere.

15:12.247 --> 15:14.044
Heard about globalization?
It's ridiculous.

15:15.967 --> 15:18.276
How about in Mexico City, Don Victor.

15:18.527 --> 15:21.758
What are you gonna do?
Go there and knock on his door?

15:22.567 --> 15:24.922
I am not afraid of them.
Besides, my friends will back me up.

15:30.727 --> 15:34.163
These two blockheads?
Look at them!

15:34.647 --> 15:36.797
You don't have any idea about the Russian!
You guys wont be a treat to them

15:37.487 --> 15:38.681
They will go with me!

15:45.007 --> 15:47.999
Why the long faces?
Are we not in fact brothers?

15:48.247 --> 15:50.761
She is my sister, God Damn!
You chickenshits!

15:50.927 --> 15:55.876
It's my sister, for Christ sake!
Kiss my ass, jerkoffs!

15:57.007 --> 15:58.520
Calm down!
Calm down!

16:00.247 --> 16:03.159
Calm down right now!
Stay calm!

16:04.087 --> 16:05.645
Take it easy...
easy.

16:09.687 --> 16:12.838
If they really taken her,
she's probably in route by now.

16:13.847 --> 16:15.041
In route where?

16:16.927 --> 16:19.487
After they kidnap the girls,
they get'm across the border

16:19.967 --> 16:27.521
As soon as possible and there they sell them,
they do the same thing over and over again.

16:28.487 --> 16:32.196
If it is who I think it is,
they always use the same routine.

16:32.807 --> 16:34.923
They stay usually in a
place close by the airport.

16:35.847 --> 16:41.202
And they get more money if
they sell them to... pedophiles.

16:56.927 --> 16:57.962
Thanks you

16:58.927 --> 17:00.962
In there

17:09.327 --> 17:10.999
Don't touch me, please.

17:11.487 --> 17:18.837
Come on, lay down and enjoy yourself.
We know, where your son is.

17:53.567 --> 17:55.523
Mexico - The cheapest way there?

18:00.287 --> 18:02.437
This here is the best choice.

18:06.007 --> 18:09.124
I need to make some money,
so I can take my son to America.

18:19.327 --> 18:20.919
Mom is back!

18:24.167 --> 18:29.605
You'll be very happy with this travel package,
I agree it's the best way,

18:31.567 --> 18:34.206
The names and the address of my parents,
is that really necessary?

18:34.487 --> 18:36.796
Usual bureaucratic procedure.

18:48.087 --> 18:49.087
It's here.

18:54.367 --> 18:58.076
Why! Is it necessary for us to be here?

18:59.767 --> 19:01.246
No it's not necessary.

19:50.447 --> 19:51.641
Take this.

20:21.807 --> 20:27.245
Vitamins... It'll help for the pain.

20:32.807 --> 20:36.277
Take it,
understand!

21:34.367 --> 21:36.244
Do you speak spanish?

21:41.887 --> 21:43.286
English?

21:44.687 --> 21:46.166
A little.

21:46.527 --> 21:49.200
Me too... a little.

21:59.847 --> 22:01.724
I wish all this would end.

22:04.007 --> 22:09.081
I want to go home, I miss my mother.

22:22.167 --> 22:23.919
You believe in it?

22:28.647 --> 22:30.319
You pray to it?

22:32.607 --> 22:36.236
Yes.
Very strong.

22:37.367 --> 22:41.918
She's great,
she'll make my brother to find me.

22:43.367 --> 22:44.800
You have a brother?

22:46.127 --> 22:47.640
That's good.

22:58.847 --> 23:00.439
Hey! Hello!

23:01.527 --> 23:03.995
Did you see a girl,
about this tall, with long hair?

23:04.527 --> 23:06.916
Dark hair, brown eyes, very pretty?

23:07.287 --> 23:08.800
No.
- Thanks.

23:14.247 --> 23:17.500
This tall, long dark hair,
with a ribbon?

23:18.067 --> 23:19.002
No.

23:19.167 --> 23:20.295
Did you see her?

23:21.087 --> 23:21.822
No.

23:22.087 --> 23:24.218
Dark hair, dark eyes, like yours.

23:24.227 --> 23:26.924
We got to go, hurry up, hurry...

23:27.527 --> 23:29.165
Did you see a little girl?

23:29.807 --> 23:31.365
Did you see a little girl, that tall?

23:31.687 --> 23:33.961
No, no, no, I didn't see her.

23:33.967 --> 23:35.266
With a ribbon.

23:35.467 --> 23:38.242
Watch where you're going,
why don't you look?

23:38.447 --> 23:39.846
Keep a look out and watch them

23:40.447 --> 23:43.165
Let's get going, get a move on.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.239
Come on sweety.

23:53.487 --> 23:57.825
Here we go, get in there,
let's move it.

24:20.887 --> 24:21.956
This guy has some fucking nerve!

24:24.807 --> 24:26.235
Shit!

24:26.247 --> 24:27.441
That asshole!

24:28.247 --> 24:31.521
Where the hell's he going, that bastard?

24:31.807 --> 24:33.081
Fuck!

24:35.727 --> 24:37.206
That motherfucker!

24:43.487 --> 24:45.318
Where is this place wheelbarrow?

24:49.247 --> 24:50.680
Thank you
thank you

25:34.047 --> 25:36.117
You got to take these pills.
You understand me?

25:50.727 --> 25:52.718
What flowers have you brought us today?

26:03.367 --> 26:05.835
How you all doing?
Will they behave and not cause a problem?

26:10.527 --> 26:12.404
Which one do you like?

26:12.967 --> 26:15.276
The nice blonde.

26:15.527 --> 26:16.926
She's very young.

26:20.687 --> 26:23.326
You, you and you, get out.
You too.

26:24.007 --> 26:25.838
Let's go! Hurry up! Let's move it!

26:26.807 --> 26:30.959
Very well, they wont be any trouble.

26:35.127 --> 26:38.403
Over here! Let's go!

26:42.767 --> 26:44.519
Good morning, senorita.

27:05.327 --> 27:06.327
Put this on.

27:07.207 --> 27:09.243
Right here, let's go, hurry up!

27:18.247 --> 27:20.124
The documents have to be
ready by tomorrow.

27:21.087 --> 27:24.966
Forgive me, my friend,
but nothing get's done here without money.

27:36.007 --> 27:39.556
Here are a lot of scoundrels.
Really, how about the officer?

27:43.607 --> 27:44.801
Probably.

27:50.487 --> 27:55.607
Come here, stand right there.

28:01.127 --> 28:06.121
Pose.
Pose, like a cover girl for a magazine.

28:11.927 --> 28:13.440
Pose, and smile damn it!
Do it right,

28:13.687 --> 28:15.166
I understand!

29:05.687 --> 29:14.686
What the fuck?
Don't stop now! Shit...

29:19.527 --> 29:20.527
Fucking shit!

30:21.447 --> 30:26.237
It's good, yes?
You must to eat.

30:42.607 --> 30:44.006
Mommy no eat.

30:46.647 --> 30:47.875
Hey, mommy.

30:48.127 --> 30:51.961
I don't know when, but one day you'll suffer
from the same cruelty, you've been giving us.

31:05.607 --> 31:11.523
Fucking communists.
Sure it was hard, yes?

31:13.127 --> 31:14.799
Devil's communists.

31:27.527 --> 31:28.846
Can I use your phone please?

31:29.727 --> 31:31.080
Sure, you can make a call.

31:48.487 --> 31:51.206
Hello?
Who is it?

31:54.167 --> 31:55.725
Hello? Why?

31:58.047 --> 31:59.605
Why?

34:05.367 --> 34:06.367
Hello?

36:08.487 --> 36:09.681
Everybody down!
Stay down! Stay down!

36:18.087 --> 36:19.236
We're on the border.

36:29.527 --> 36:30.721
Be careful.

36:31.167 --> 36:32.361
Good luck, let's go.

36:40.487 --> 36:41.522
What?

37:34.887 --> 37:36.843
Well, we made it across

37:45.887 --> 37:47.843
Shut your mouth or your
family will end up dead.

37:49.607 --> 37:51.916
Police!
Hands up! Don't move!

38:10.567 --> 38:12.762
Ray, is it you?

38:12.967 --> 38:13.967
Hi, honey.

38:14.167 --> 38:16.317
What's going on?
Where are you?

38:16.607 --> 38:19.041
I'm in Juarez.
I'll be home tomorrow.

38:19.687 --> 38:20.915
How is Ramona doing?

38:21.087 --> 38:24.363
Not so good,
I had to take her to the Vet again.

38:26.127 --> 38:27.958
What you're doing in Juarez?

38:29.967 --> 38:33.642
Nothing really, get some sleep.
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:05.367 --> 39:07.642
Delivering a speech from the oval office, the President
emphasized the importance of security at the border

39:07.967 --> 39:11.403
Now it's a 1.9 billion dollar
campaign to tighten border security.

39:12.687 --> 39:17.158
He hopes to win the backing from conservatives
to overhaul the immigration laws.

39:17.767 --> 39:20.759
And plans to order thousands
of troups to the Mexican border.

39:20.967 --> 39:22.002
Welcome back, sir.

40:27.567 --> 40:29.762
Everybody fallow me.
What will happen to them?

40:30.087 --> 40:33.124
They'll send them back to Mexico,
and release them.

40:33.407 --> 40:35.682
Most of them will cross
the border again tomorrow.

40:37.427 --> 40:42.715
Hello, I'm a student from
El Paso High

40:43.607 --> 40:47.806

42:45.767 --> 42:46.802
Where are we going?

42:47.007 --> 42:48.007
Going to the Police.

42:48.247 --> 42:49.396
Fuck!

42:49.607 --> 42:53.077
You broke the law, son.
And you got real unlucky, because I'm a cop.

42:53.527 --> 42:54.880
Fuck that!

42:55.167 --> 42:58.407
Watch your language in my car.
Fasten your seat belt.

42:58.408 --> 42:59.442

42:59.607 --> 43:01.279
Your belt!
Put it on!

43:02.087 --> 43:03.156

43:06.207 --> 43:07.481
Watch your language.

43:07.807 --> 43:09.126

43:24.247 --> 43:27.523
Look Mr... you can't take me to the police.

43:28.407 --> 43:29.920
Well I have to.

43:30.247 --> 43:32.477
They'll send me back,
I got to stay here!

43:32.727 --> 43:34.683
I'm looking for my little sister!
She was kidnapped!

43:34.685 --> 43:35.322
I'm not kidding, man!

43:36.527 --> 43:37.596
Sure.

43:37.927 --> 43:39.326
My little sister she's just 13!

43:40.607 --> 43:44.236
They took her in Mexico city, and I followed
them all the way up to that house in Juarez!

43:45.647 --> 43:46.966
What house?

43:48.167 --> 43:50.237
You know the house,
you were there.

43:55.367 --> 43:57.517
Please, Mr... I need to get to New Jersey?

43:57.967 --> 43:59.195
Why New Jersey?

43:59.407 --> 44:02.046
To find her!
It's my fault she got taken!

44:02.567 --> 44:04.239
If your a cop?
Why can't you help me?

44:04.687 --> 44:08.440
I not that kind of cop.

44:11.247 --> 44:14.045
If your telling the truth,
the police will help you.

44:14.447 --> 44:15.960
Sure the will the fucking police!

44:16.807 --> 44:18.081
This isn't Mexico.

44:18.807 --> 44:21.002
Yeah right,
like the cops are so different here!

44:21.527 --> 44:25.236
They'll do nothing but send me back,
then my sister will be here all alone!

44:27.767 --> 44:31.043
Don't you understand?
They will do something terrible to her!

44:31.767 --> 44:33.598
She is pure!
She never...

44:33.807 --> 44:35.206
All right!

44:35.447 --> 44:36.800
So what you gonna do?

44:37.087 --> 44:39.396
Go to the police.
I hate liars.

44:41.487 --> 44:44.684
Forgive me, last time we had some problem.
This time I am more informed.

44:44.967 --> 44:48.322
Stay back, let me take a look.

45:21.847 --> 45:23.439
Let's go! Move it.

45:34.807 --> 45:35.956
Sacred Virgin, Sacred Maiden,

45:36.487 --> 45:38.796
The Lord be with you,
and blessed are thee...

45:39.367 --> 45:41.039
Forgive me for what I have done...

45:41.487 --> 45:45.002
Sacred Mary, Sacred Virgin,
pray for us sinners...

45:56.247 --> 45:57.247
Can I help you ma'am?

45:57.487 --> 45:58.487
Somebody broke in.

45:59.607 --> 46:00.960
The back was door was locked.

46:01.367 --> 46:03.722
My husband is out of town,
and we moved in recently.

46:03.967 --> 46:06.401
Can somebody come out to the house...

46:06.687 --> 46:08.247

46:20.247 --> 46:21.919
We'll try to get somebody
out there right the way

46:22.167 --> 46:25.159
Sorry to interrupt.
I need to see your Commanding Officer.

46:25.447 --> 46:27.597
I got a boy here,
he says his sister been kidnapped.

46:27.687 --> 46:28.687
Which boy?

46:42.767 --> 46:45.520
Come here.
Where're you going?

46:45.927 --> 46:47.440
New Jersey, I told you.

46:47.727 --> 46:49.797
If you're going to I
you're going the wrong direction.

46:50.087 --> 46:51.156
It is that way.

46:53.727 --> 46:55.319
You just gonna take me back to the cops.

46:55.447 --> 46:56.447
No, I won't

46:58.167 --> 47:00.237
Listen, if your sister is in New Jersey,

47:00.487 --> 47:03.206
I know someone there,
who might be able to help us.

47:03.887 --> 47:05.002
Us!

47:05.367 --> 47:07.278
A guy I went to the academy
with he's a good man.

47:07.767 --> 47:09.359
Come on we should try to see him.

47:13.647 --> 47:15.080
Is it far away from here?

47:17.127 --> 47:20.836
It's a little out of the way,
but... I'll take you.

47:22.327 --> 47:23.760
Why should I trust you?

47:24.007 --> 47:25.326
I don't think you a have choice.

47:33.447 --> 47:34.562
Come on.

47:42.847 --> 47:44.485
Please change the music.

47:46.327 --> 47:49.683
You don't like that?
Put your seat belt on.

47:57.647 --> 47:59.160
What for, it's stupid.

48:12.967 --> 48:16.243
Middle of the damn day?
Don't do it again stupid.

48:16.607 --> 48:18.563
You think the cops taking a nap?

48:19.207 --> 48:20.401
Are you crazy?

48:23.087 --> 48:24.406
That ain't bad.

48:25.007 --> 48:32.357
We are here, aren't we?
And I'm not crazy.

48:36.207 --> 48:39.324
Hurry, hurry, let's go!
Pick up a knot! Move!

48:52.287 --> 48:56.838
You got a name?
I thought, even Mexicans have name's.

48:57.247 --> 48:58.726
Fuck!
What's your problem?

49:06.007 --> 49:07.725

49:09.887 --> 49:12.526
How come you speak english so well?

49:13.807 --> 49:15.638
I work in tourist industry.

49:17.207 --> 49:18.401
Put your foot down!

49:18.647 --> 49:20.877
My god!
What's the big deal!

49:21.647 --> 49:22.841
The car can be cleaned!

49:23.047 --> 49:24.639
Exactly.

49:34.327 --> 49:35.840
That's yours now.

49:40.247 --> 49:42.238
So... how come you there
in that house in Juarez?

49:42.727 --> 49:44.206
Private investigation.

49:46.127 --> 49:48.038
What kind of investigation Ray,

49:49.047 --> 49:51.959
It's private.
That means I don't want to talk about it.

49:52.007 --> 49:53.007
Why not?

49:53.207 --> 49:54.356
Because I don't!

49:54.687 --> 49:58.043
Oh, Jesus!
Why you getting so pissed off?

50:02.967 --> 50:04.685
We got to find a rest stop.

50:07.127 --> 50:08.958
When's the last time you took a shower?

50:09.487 --> 50:10.522
What?

50:10.727 --> 50:12.922
If you haven't noticed it, you stink.

50:19.767 --> 50:22.564
Stop here, we'll make some real
good pocket change off of this

50:27.647 --> 50:29.080
They're not real busy yet.

50:29.527 --> 50:30.960
You stay with the rest of them.

50:42.407 --> 50:43.920
You, come here.

50:44.847 --> 50:46.447
No!
Take me!

50:46.448 --> 50:47.487
Let her go.

50:47.488 --> 50:48.488
Take me!

50:48.489 --> 50:49.622
Hey! Let her go!
Take me!

50:50.727 --> 50:54.322
She's really scared, don't take her,
let me go instead,

51:01.327 --> 51:02.840
Veronica!

51:11.567 --> 51:13.444
You will be called Princess,
that's your new name

51:28.607 --> 51:31.804
But no fucking this one.
I have to keep her a real virgin.

51:33.087 --> 51:34.156
How much?

51:34.407 --> 51:35.556
$80.00

52:20.207 --> 52:22.481
I'm a virgin.

53:42.707 --> 53:44.424
It's only 14 more kilometers.

54:30.442 --> 54:32.000
Patty is something wrong?

54:34.840 --> 54:37.717
Why?
How's Ramona?

54:40.477 --> 54:43.274
The Vet had to put her to sleep.

54:46.274 --> 54:47.752
When?

54:48.353 --> 54:49.785
This afternoon.

54:51.751 --> 54:55.537
If you've taken your God-Damn cell phone
with you, I could have reached you.

54:58.188 --> 54:59.586
I'm so sorry Patty.

55:01.266 --> 55:05.257
It's good to hear that.
It's really good to hear that.

55:06.523 --> 55:09.422
Patty?
I can't talk anymore Ray.

55:12.820 --> 55:14.094
Good night.

55:14.659 --> 55:16.038
Let's eat.

55:16.039 --> 55:17.273
Who's Ramona?

55:17.278 --> 55:18.546
It's our cat.

55:19.097 --> 55:20.332
You have a cat?

55:21.176 --> 55:22.813
Yeah, people do have pets, you know.

55:23.415 --> 55:24.449
I hate cats.

55:24.774 --> 55:25.809
Okay.

55:26.054 --> 55:27.122
Any kids?

55:27.373 --> 55:28.600
Kids? No.

55:34.049 --> 55:35.562
So you guys live alone with a cat?

55:36.808 --> 55:37.922
Yeah.

55:38.083 --> 55:40.118
That's cool?

55:46.202 --> 55:49.751
New T-shirt, pretty cool huh?

55:55.239 --> 55:58.991
Listen, I only have pesos.
Are you going to pay?

55:59.356 --> 56:01.311
Do I have a choice?
You order what you want.

56:01.515 --> 56:02.789
Okay then.

56:03.594 --> 56:05.185
Are you guys all ready to order?

56:06.113 --> 56:10.309
Yes I'll have orange juice, coffee
an omelette with cheese and bacon.

56:10.711 --> 56:11.745
Thank you.

56:12.070 --> 56:17.141
I want a cup of coffee too, an orange juice, an
omelette with cheese, ham, mushrooms and onions.

56:17.187 --> 56:22.122
A fruit salad with yogurt, and a New York
ribeye steak medium rare with fries,

56:22.185 --> 56:26.937
Pancakes with blueberries and
a strawberry milk shake please.

56:31.900 --> 56:33.218

56:34.138 --> 56:36.093
You said I could order what ever I want.

56:36.497 --> 56:37.850
Right.

56:42.014 --> 56:44.285
I know that kid.

57:03.523 --> 57:06.399
Hey! Stay away from my van,
you God-Damn little punk!

57:10.079 --> 57:13.433
What's going on here?

57:14.197 --> 57:15.471
I'm looking for somebody!

57:15.676 --> 57:16.711
Let me see some I.D.

57:17.276 --> 57:18.947
I left them at home sir.

57:19.195 --> 57:20.263
Where do you live?

57:20.314 --> 57:20.849
I live...

57:20.893 --> 57:22.062
Allen, Texas.

57:22.073 --> 57:24.090
This is my son, Officer.
Where the hell have you been?

57:24.112 --> 57:25.080
Allen P.D.

57:25.151 --> 57:27.269
I'm looking all over for you.

57:27.270 --> 57:30.146
No problem.
Have a nice night.

57:30.149 --> 57:31.941
Thank you,
you too.

57:34.907 --> 57:35.975
What the hell is going on?

57:36.186 --> 57:37.221
I knew that kid!

57:37.266 --> 57:38.334
From where?

57:38.705 --> 57:40.820
He was with my sister!
I saw him!

57:41.024 --> 57:43.298
He's one of the kids that they took.

57:43.542 --> 57:45.930
Excuse me sir,
can I talk to you for a second?

57:46.220 --> 57:49.659
Hey, you! I wanna ask you a question,
is this boy your son?

57:49.660 --> 57:50.660
I'm sorry?

57:50.859 --> 57:52.177
I asked you if this boy is your son?

57:52.578 --> 57:53.692
There's a misunderstanding.

57:53.897 --> 57:55.454
Sure. Come on.

57:55.656 --> 57:57.646
I'm trying to find the boys parents!
I didn't do anything!

57:58.135 --> 57:59.806
Listen!
Where did you get the boy?

57:59.894 --> 58:00.974
I don't know what you're talking about.

58:00.975 --> 58:02.053
You son of a bitch!

58:03.212 --> 58:04.327
Where's my sister,
you son of a bitch!

58:04.532 --> 58:05.759
You fucking bastard!
I hope, you'll die!

58:06.971 --> 58:08.198
Calm down!
Calm down!

58:09.430 --> 58:16.280
I want you to take the boy
outside and give him to the police.

58:16.430 --> 58:17.280
Go with him outside...

58:18.604 --> 58:21.595
I hope you'll die, motherfucker!

58:26.121 --> 58:30.191
Okay we got two possibilities here?

58:30.878 --> 58:32.196
There's cops out there.

58:32.437 --> 58:36.223
If you like, we scan go out there
and let them handle this whole thing.

58:36.675 --> 58:38.744
And you know,
they love guys like you.

58:39.754 --> 58:42.346
Or we can handle this just between us?

58:43.791 --> 58:45.429
What do you want from me?

58:46.070 --> 58:47.469
All I want is information.

58:49.389 --> 58:51.344
You okay?
Can you understand what I'm saying?

58:52.427 --> 58:53.905
Can you tell what happened?

58:54.506 --> 58:55.779
I'll be back in a second.

58:56.385 --> 58:57.453
What we got?

58:57.664 --> 58:58.779
Possibly child molester.

58:58.984 --> 59:00.177
So?

59:01.502 --> 59:02.537
Nothing.

59:02.862 --> 59:04.010
Nothing?

59:05.020 --> 59:06.692
He doesn't know where
the other kids are.

59:08.179 --> 59:09.372
Hands on your head!

59:09.698 --> 59:11.130
Enough we gotta roll.

59:11.417 --> 59:12.645
Yes, yes.

59:52.636 --> 59:57.502
Okay don't cry.
Tell me.

59:59.033 --> 01:00:04.343
I want to go home.
My mom don't love me no more.

01:00:05.309 --> 01:00:08.856
Your mom always loves you.
Always.

01:00:14.425 --> 01:00:16.494
It's party time.

01:00:16.703 --> 01:00:19.262
Leave us alone,
we don't want.

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:26.174
It's no question about
volunteering, bitch.

01:00:32.975 --> 01:00:36.522
You see?
Well, good gal.

01:00:38.572 --> 01:00:41.926
Swallow now, swallow,

01:00:56.003 --> 01:00:57.674
Good gal.

01:01:08.637 --> 01:01:09.910

Just come to get you. I need your help.

01:02:13.643 --> 01:02:17.236
Sir... that's my sister.

01:02:20.919 --> 01:02:22.715
Her name is Adriana not Maria.

01:02:41.309 --> 01:02:43.696
Bidding starts at $500.00 coming soon

01:02:44.107 --> 01:02:45.460
Stay tuned!

01:02:47.026 --> 01:02:52.700
I'm gonna kill the motherfucker
who does this. I kill them.

01:02:56.901 --> 01:02:59.174
Yeah, yeah.
I tried the password, it checks out

01:03:01.538 --> 01:03:03.732
Bidding starts.
Probably, in a day.

01:03:04.297 --> 01:03:06.526
I leave it up to you.
Alright.

01:03:16.850 --> 01:03:20.761
So... what did your friend say?

01:03:21.168 --> 01:03:22.566
Good news,
he's on the case.

01:03:22.767 --> 01:03:25.075
I gave him all the information.
The password all that stuff.

01:03:26.365 --> 01:03:29.162
He's gonna pass it on to his
friend at the Internet Crime Unit.

01:03:29.604 --> 01:03:31.400
They'll take care of it.

01:03:32.282 --> 01:03:35.398
Password? That's what the
guy gave you in the bathroom.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.832
Yeah,
he bought that kid on the Internet.

01:03:39.799 --> 01:03:43.028
He was the highest bidder,
he flew all the way from Thailand.

01:03:43.277 --> 01:03:45.709
He paid $25,000.00,
that's how it works.

01:03:47.754 --> 01:03:49.709
I am sorry I didn't tell you before.

01:03:50.953 --> 01:03:53.227
I just wanted to make sure.
I'm just trying to protect you.

01:03:53.471 --> 01:03:54.471
Thanks.

01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:57.748
Jorge this is good news.

01:03:58.509 --> 01:04:02.625
Jesus!
You don't trust anybody, do you?

01:04:04.426 --> 01:04:08.463
Not everyone is your enemies, you know.
Try a little optimism sometime.

01:04:09.063 --> 01:04:10.178
It wont kill you.

01:04:11.502 --> 01:04:13.378
And be like you,
and end up with a cat?

01:04:23.576 --> 01:04:26.169
Sorry, I didn't mean it like that.

01:04:30.972 --> 01:04:32.120
When is the auction?

01:04:32.371 --> 01:04:36.123
Soon, I like to be in New Jersey
when it happens, wouldn't you?

01:04:37.049 --> 01:04:38.083
Do you drive?

01:04:38.568 --> 01:04:40.239
You want me to drive?

01:04:40.487 --> 01:04:41.522
I'm tired.

01:04:41.766 --> 01:04:43.643
But if I drive,
we need to play another music.

01:04:43.925 --> 01:04:45.358
What is your problem with my music?

01:04:46.124 --> 01:04:48.557
It puts me to sleep,
you want us to get killed or something?

01:04:55.399 --> 01:04:56.798
You can't stay here.

01:04:56.999 --> 01:04:59.830
Two guys and three girls, that's to many!
It's gonna look suspicious!

01:05:02.475 --> 01:05:04.864
It's only two girls.

01:05:05.193 --> 01:05:08.831
Have you gone crazy?
Look, I know that, we leave tomorrow.

01:05:11.751 --> 01:05:12.785
What?

01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:14.184
Nothing.

01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:24.661
Hello? How you doing?

01:05:27.023 --> 01:05:31.572
Listen, we've been on the
road day and night, simply...

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:36.412
Okay calm down, calm down.

01:05:38.377 --> 01:05:39.855
All right, I've got it. Yeah.

01:05:42.415 --> 01:05:49.045
Son of a bitch. They set up
the next auction for tomorrow.

01:05:49.452 --> 01:05:50.725
You've got to be kidding me.

01:05:50.971 --> 01:05:54.757
That's what they want, she's next.

01:05:55.728 --> 01:05:58.036
We have to be in New Jersey by tomorrow.

01:06:00.166 --> 01:06:02.201
That's unreal.

01:06:05.683 --> 01:06:06.718
Get up.

01:06:09.521 --> 01:06:11.112
Get up!

01:06:21.875 --> 01:06:23.148
Good morning.

01:07:10.770 --> 01:07:16.125
Good morning.
What kind of cop are you?

01:07:16.886 --> 01:07:18.921
I'm in the Fraud Department.

01:07:19.125 --> 01:07:20.194
What kind of fraud?

01:07:20.484 --> 01:07:21.803
Insurance, mainly.

01:07:22.763 --> 01:07:24.957
You work for insurance companies?

01:07:25.522 --> 01:07:26.590
Well, yes.

01:07:27.161 --> 01:07:29.628
I think, you work for the wrong side.

01:07:43.593 --> 01:07:45.105
You have Mexicans friends?

01:07:45.352 --> 01:07:48.023
I have Mexican friends.
A very good friend in fact.

01:07:48.270 --> 01:07:51.341
He works in the office
right next to mine.

01:07:51.788 --> 01:07:53.584
You only have one Mexican friend?

01:07:55.346 --> 01:07:56.859
A good friend.

01:07:58.385 --> 01:08:01.295
How can you live in Texas, and not
have hundreds of Mexican friends?

01:08:04.182 --> 01:08:07.172
Okay wise ass do you have
a hundred American friends?

01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:08.972
All my friends are Americans.

01:08:09.139 --> 01:08:10.174
Really?

01:08:10.459 --> 01:08:11.493
Yes.

01:08:11.698 --> 01:08:17.372
All Mexicans are Americans, and all my friends
are Mexicans, so, all my friends are Americans.

01:08:17.935 --> 01:08:21.050
It's Northern America, Central
America and South America.

01:08:21.453 --> 01:08:25.569
That's America. And not
just you, in one country?

01:08:35.593 --> 01:08:37.707
Heeeyyy...

01:08:59.593 --> 01:09:00.707
Now!

01:09:25.939 --> 01:09:27.054

01:09:27.979 --> 01:09:30.207
What did I tell you!
What did I tell you!

01:09:32.736 --> 01:09:33.850
Stupid son of a bitch!

01:09:34.255 --> 01:09:36.051
You idiot! Let's go,

01:10:15.275 --> 01:10:19.312
Go... I call my family.

01:10:19.432 --> 01:10:21.740
Look there, the police. Look.

01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:24.421
Run.

01:10:40.061 --> 01:10:41.335

01:10:41.581 --> 01:10:42.808

01:10:47.697 --> 01:10:49.016
This is international can I help you?

01:10:49.217 --> 01:10:50.365
Yes... collect to Poland.

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:51.495

7, 3, 7, 5, 5, 1, 5

01:10:55.813 --> 01:10:56.712

01:10:57.812 --> 01:10:59.580
One moment please.

01:11:01.134 --> 01:11:02.134
Mamma?

01:11:02.169 --> 01:11:04.361
Veronica, where are you?

01:11:05.128 --> 01:11:09.438
Mamma, I'm glad to hear your
voice. Listen, I have a problem.

01:11:10.165 --> 01:11:12.155
Is everything alright?
Mamma! Mamma!

01:11:12.404 --> 01:11:14.495
You need to leave there.
You and dad are in danger!

01:11:15.363 --> 01:11:17.839
Have you made it to America yet?

01:11:18.082 --> 01:11:19.081
Go!

01:11:19.641 --> 01:11:21.870
What are you saying?
With what?

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:26.310
People from Agency came by.
They have shown me documents.

01:11:26.557 --> 01:11:28.036
They've taken them from me.

01:11:28.516 --> 01:11:32.951
Mamma they're gangsters.
Mamma they're holding me... help!

01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:45.663
Get them in the van! Hurry!

01:11:47.246 --> 01:11:49.754
Who did you call?
Who the fuck did you call?

01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:53.182
Who do you think she called asshole?
She called the cops!

01:11:53.703 --> 01:11:56.535
Who did you call?
Well you can forget it, you will now pay for this.

01:11:56.782 --> 01:11:58.214
And your son.

01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:22.448
Get your ass out there,
and keep it out of site.

01:13:14.222 --> 01:13:18.770
You pay for this, I will show you.

01:13:29.294 --> 01:13:38.846
No! No! No!

01:16:33.919 --> 01:16:34.953
Come in.

01:16:40.155 --> 01:16:41.190
You're late, Manuel.

01:16:43.034 --> 01:16:44.102
Here.

01:16:51.469 --> 01:16:52.663
Sit down.

01:16:59.185 --> 01:17:00.504
You're, probably Adriana, yes?

01:17:02.864 --> 01:17:03.898
Yes.

01:17:04.783 --> 01:17:12.174
What a beautiful name.
Is this what everyone calls you?

01:17:15.457 --> 01:17:18.254
You have no idea,
how to deal with young girls, do you?

01:17:20.295 --> 01:17:21.807
Where are the other girls?

01:17:29.970 --> 01:17:32.163
You hear me?
Where are the other girls?

01:17:33.048 --> 01:17:40.041
The Brazilians kept one of them,
and the other...

01:17:40.684 --> 01:17:43.754
We lost on the way here,

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.994
She had an accident.

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:48.994
Which one?

01:17:51.119 --> 01:17:52.346
Which one?

01:17:52.598 --> 01:17:54.110
The one from Poland.

01:17:54.957 --> 01:17:56.594
Another accident?

01:17:58.115 --> 01:18:02.868
One more accident, and we wouldn't
have any business at all

01:18:03.352 --> 01:18:04.831
Looks like you can't handle this job.

01:18:05.191 --> 01:18:09.068
You have to deal with Vadim on this
and it's not going to be very pleasant.

01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:11.896
What a loser.

01:18:15.666 --> 01:18:17.098
You're an imbecile.

01:18:19.264 --> 01:18:21.493
Let's go Adriana,
we got things to do.

01:18:22.702 --> 01:18:25.579
I'm leaving got to take care of business.

01:18:37.055 --> 01:18:39.329
Hello! Welcome to the Holiday Inn,
how may I help you?

01:18:39.933 --> 01:18:41.809
I need two rooms if you got them.

01:18:42.052 --> 01:18:43.246
Single or double, sir?

01:18:43.492 --> 01:18:44.606
Let's see what you got..

01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:51.323
It's fake.
You have internet here?

01:18:51.647 --> 01:18:53.239
Sure, in the amusement center over there.

01:18:54.046 --> 01:18:55.922
The passwords is (?), right?

01:18:57.324 --> 01:18:59.200
Would you like to pay on a credit card?

01:19:01.522 --> 01:19:05.115
Excuse me,
my wallet is here.

01:19:06.522 --> 01:19:08.115
Be right out.

01:19:11.416 --> 01:19:13.754
Hey... 2 pm

01:19:14.755 --> 01:19:17.347
Here is your room key,
you go up and get some rest.

01:19:17.834 --> 01:19:19.869
I'll be in his office,
I'm going over there now.

01:19:22.272 --> 01:19:25.228
Detective Sheridan, how exactly
did you get involved in this case?

01:19:25.630 --> 01:19:27.859
Ray not only investigates insurance fraud.

01:19:28.069 --> 01:19:30.627
But in resent occasions he also get's involved with...

01:19:31.547 --> 01:19:35.663
Detective Jefferson, no offense, but I like
to hear the story from Detective Sheridan himself.

01:19:36.544 --> 01:19:39.894
The bottom line is, this girl
will be auctioned of in a few hours,

01:19:39.942 --> 01:19:43.939
And I need to know what you
guys gonna do about that auction,

01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:48.455
Look we've been monitoring this
group for quit some time.

01:19:49.378 --> 01:19:51.492
We know where there Jersey operations are.

01:19:52.176 --> 01:19:54.928
Ray, the real problem is
that this thing is global

01:19:55.734 --> 01:19:59.850
Even though this group might be based in Mexico City,
they have operations all over the US..

01:20:00.492 --> 01:20:01.890
And over every one of the continents.

01:20:02.091 --> 01:20:05.001
Their server for example,
is located somewhere in Maldives.

01:20:05.529 --> 01:20:07.280
Their banking is in South Africa.

01:20:07.808 --> 01:20:09.718
There are many jurisdictions at work here

01:20:09.927 --> 01:20:12.917
CIA, State Department, the
Interpol etc... etc...

01:20:13.445 --> 01:20:19.152
So what we do is follow the money, connect
all the dots and we'll come up with the source.

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:25.670
I get all that, but you know
where the operation is in New Jersey.

01:20:26.039 --> 01:20:27.038
Yeah.

01:20:27.838 --> 01:20:31.955
But you can't be bothered and do
anything about this little Mexican girl,

01:20:31.996 --> 01:20:34.863
You got bigger plans.

01:20:35.993 --> 01:20:40.030
That's what you're saying,
or did I hear you wrong?

01:20:41.391 --> 01:20:43.108
Well gentlemen, if you excuse me?

01:20:44.829 --> 01:20:45.863
Thanks you

01:20:46.428 --> 01:20:47.746
We are the fucking Gringos, aren't we?

01:20:49.027 --> 01:20:50.061
Sorry?

01:20:50.786 --> 01:20:53.617
I said we are the fucking Gringos!

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:42.869
Hi Patty, I'll be home in a few more days.

01:21:45.238 --> 01:21:48.930
I want you to take out a big hunk
of money from our savings.

01:21:48.936 --> 01:21:51.870
But I don't wanna do it unless
you say it's alright.

01:21:52.254 --> 01:21:54.823
I guess I wont have to ask what it's for.

01:21:55.712 --> 01:22:00.830
I'll tell you all about it when I get home,
and I promise no more secrets.

01:22:01.869 --> 01:22:03.142
Have you found her?

01:22:05.507 --> 01:22:06.781
Karla?

01:22:08.346 --> 01:22:10.415
Karla that's her name?

01:22:13.143 --> 01:22:14.212
Yeah.

01:22:15.582 --> 01:22:22.098
Ray... if you find your daughter,
I want you to bring her home.

01:22:29.615 --> 01:22:32.111
If I do, I will.

01:22:32.932 --> 01:22:35.451
Patty...
Yeah?

01:22:38.490 --> 01:22:40.081
Thanks you

01:22:41.129 --> 01:22:43.358
You shouldn't thank me
for loving you, Ray.

01:22:45.087 --> 01:22:46.565
Bye bye.

01:22:56.541 --> 01:22:58.689
Hey, hey,
what's going on?

01:22:58.690 --> 01:23:02.717
I got us some money,
you and me gonna do the auction.

01:23:02.798 --> 01:23:03.932
And what about your friend?

01:23:04.437 --> 01:23:05.755
Forget about him.

01:23:09.054 --> 01:23:11.891
Sure you got tell to me something Gringo.

01:23:15.231 --> 01:23:16.788
Why are you doing this?

01:23:27.465 --> 01:23:28.533
Who is it?

01:23:29.984 --> 01:23:31.177
It's my daughter.

01:23:31.423 --> 01:23:32.696
Your daughter?

01:23:33.182 --> 01:23:34.296
Yeah.

01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:38.619
This is what you've been looking for?

01:23:39.419 --> 01:23:42.807
That picture was taken 10 years ago,
I really don't know what I'm looking for.

01:23:51.253 --> 01:23:56.005
I met her mother just after I was married

01:23:56.330 --> 01:24:00.965
To Patty my wife,
and I was a happily married man

01:24:02.767 --> 01:24:08.301
And then I met Eleanore,
and everything changed. She was...

01:24:12.888 --> 01:24:20.192
Oh she was so... wild and alive.

01:24:23.916 --> 01:24:27.350
I don't know what I was expecting
but I was ready to give up everything.

01:24:29.033 --> 01:24:35.024
My marriage, everything,
so stupid!  Stupid...

01:24:36.269 --> 01:24:42.453
And then she met this other guy and...

01:24:42.945 --> 01:24:48.736
He was everything I wasn't, I mean...
she found him exiting... and alive...

01:24:50.822 --> 01:24:56.655
Anyway and then she told to me,
that she was pregnant with his child. And a...

01:24:58.538 --> 01:25:04.893
That kind of did it, I left and a...
went back to Patty

01:25:05.134 --> 01:25:06.408
Did Patty take you back?

01:25:07.613 --> 01:25:08.613
Yep.

01:25:10.532 --> 01:25:11.930
Go figure.

01:25:12.531 --> 01:25:14.202
That would never happen in Mexico.

01:25:21.006 --> 01:25:25.713
Just a few days ago I get a knock at my door from a
couple of officers and they told me that Eleanore has died.

01:25:25.864 --> 01:25:27.881
From an overdose.

01:25:28.522 --> 01:25:31.558
And they found this letter
in her apartment with my name on it.

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:35.557
That she's written 10 years
before, but never sent.

01:25:36.598 --> 01:25:46.991
And she says she needs money,
and that Karla is my daughter.

01:25:48.032 --> 01:25:51.503
Which I always... wondered about.

01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:54.539
You didn't know she had a daughter did you?

01:25:57.267 --> 01:25:58.461
I did.

01:26:03.984 --> 01:26:06.019
We had our ups and downs years

01:26:06.303 --> 01:26:09.179
We helped her out all we could,
but she's always in trouble

01:26:09.621 --> 01:26:10.621
And the daughter?

01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:14.931
In foster homes mostly,
but I always managed to get her back.

01:26:17.377 --> 01:26:18.775
After you.

01:26:27.252 --> 01:26:31.526
She went over the border to
Juarez about ten years ago.

01:26:31.730 --> 01:26:33.924
Probably at the time when she
wrote you that letter.

01:26:34.688 --> 01:26:35.916
Was her daughter with her?

01:26:36.447 --> 01:26:37.846
We have no idea.

01:26:38.406 --> 01:26:42.920
We do know, that she got back here
two years later,

01:26:43.106 --> 01:26:44.320
The girl was gone

01:26:44.442 --> 01:26:47.791
And the house was still a mess.
Did you...

01:26:47.819 --> 01:26:52.826
Did you ask her what happened to the daughter.

01:26:54.317 --> 01:26:57.549
She told us that she left her with her daddy.

01:26:57.574 --> 01:27:03.626
We didn't know what kind of daddy she was talking about?
We couldn't prove anything, what are you talking about?

01:27:03.633 --> 01:27:09.982
We think, she sold the girl
I don't know, but with junkies that happens

01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:14.979
She sold her.

01:27:18.746 --> 01:27:25.623
If I... if I gotten that letter 10 years before,
everything would be different.

01:27:26.063 --> 01:27:29.834
Me and Patty always wanted a child.

01:27:32.418 --> 01:27:33.976
She's pretty, ain't she?

01:27:35.737 --> 01:27:37.947
Yes, she has beautiful eyes.

01:27:38.775 --> 01:27:41.412
Green.. Like her mothers.

01:27:46.811 --> 01:27:49.983
So, that's what you where
doing in the house in Juarez.

01:27:50.409 --> 01:27:55.986
Well, by the time you climbed in to my trunk,
I've pretty much givin' up on everything.

01:27:56.807 --> 01:28:03.801
But now I realized I gave up to soon.
Which is something I do a lot of...

01:28:04.807 --> 01:28:05.801
I guess.

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:14.710
Veronica, I hope, you are happy in heaven.
If you can talk to Virgin Mary for me,

01:28:14.757 --> 01:28:19.908
And ask her to have a good and
kind person buy me at the auction.

01:28:20.754 --> 01:28:25.064
I'm very scared. Please help me.

01:28:29.754 --> 01:28:30.064
Be well.

01:28:39.184 --> 01:28:40.377
It's started already.

01:28:41.663 --> 01:28:44.858
We need a name. Write: World Traveler.

01:28:45.341 --> 01:28:46.409
Okay.

01:28:54.216 --> 01:28:55.568
Alright we're in.

01:28:55.775 --> 01:28:57.844
One bidder is on line, at $8,000.00,

01:28:58.374 --> 01:28:59.772
Go $10,000.00

01:29:10.488 --> 01:29:12.239
Little Buddha goes to twelve.

01:29:12.766 --> 01:29:15.085
Try... try thirteen.

01:29:24.981 --> 01:29:26.332
It's fifteen now

01:29:26.399 --> 01:29:28.071
Go to eighteen.

01:29:36.394 --> 01:29:38.861
A new one from South Africa went to...

01:29:38.872 --> 01:29:41.371
All right. All right
21?

01:29:41.376 --> 01:29:42.264
Yeah.

01:29:54.065 --> 01:29:57.056
Please, god help, I promise, no more tricks.

01:29:57.503 --> 01:29:59.538
I shall not steal any more.

01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:04.813
Go 25.

01:30:12.616 --> 01:30:14.207

01:30:14.655 --> 01:30:19.721
All right, all right go twenty
nine. No, go to 32,000.00.

01:30:19.812 --> 01:30:23.325
But wait till there's only 2 seconds left

01:30:32.765 --> 01:30:33.834

01:30:40.921 --> 01:30:43.036
The auction is closed! The winner:
World Traveler.

01:30:43.959 --> 01:30:45.187
Thanks!

01:30:47.038 --> 01:30:48.436
Let's find out where she is

01:30:48.557 --> 01:30:49.591
Okay.

01:30:52.995 --> 01:30:54.063
They wanna know where we are.

01:30:54.394 --> 01:30:59.987
All right give them the address of the hotel
and tell them to ask for World Traveler

01:31:01.150 --> 01:31:02.265
Yes.

01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:03.743
Congratulations.

01:31:03.949 --> 01:31:05.142

01:31:09.666 --> 01:31:10.859
Okay.

01:31:11.105 --> 01:31:13.140
Why are you in hotel?

01:31:13.504 --> 01:31:15.573
Yeah, I'm on the road a lot

01:31:15.943 --> 01:31:17.421
What do you do?

01:31:17.702 --> 01:31:19.020
I'm a sales rep.

01:31:19.261 --> 01:31:22.093
Well you sure got a lot of dough for a sales rep.

01:31:23.419 --> 01:31:26.216
You must really like virgins pussy ha?

01:31:26.497 --> 01:31:28.691
Oh yeah.

01:31:30.136 --> 01:31:33.206
You gonna get an address in your computer

01:31:33.774 --> 01:31:36.684
You bring the money,

01:31:57.841 --> 01:31:58.910

01:32:01.639 --> 01:32:02.867
You got the money?

01:32:06.757 --> 01:32:08.109

01:32:08.316 --> 01:32:09.589
Not far from here.

01:32:12.394 --> 01:32:14.145
Leave your car here,

01:32:14.473 --> 01:32:15.700
No, I follow you.

01:32:15.912 --> 01:32:17.185
No, no, no.

01:32:17.471 --> 01:32:22.747

01:33:10.324 --> 01:33:12.041

01:33:24.237 --> 01:33:25.715

01:33:25.916 --> 01:33:26.984
Follow me.

01:33:34.191 --> 01:33:35.191
Hello.

01:33:38.589 --> 01:33:39.941
How you doing?

01:33:40.508 --> 01:33:42.065
Fine, how are and you?

01:33:42.267 --> 01:33:45.144
Good, have a seat.

01:34:01.457 --> 01:34:03.890
No, no, no, give him the money.

01:34:14.690 --> 01:34:18.477
So? Do you like her?

01:34:19.168 --> 01:34:21.203
Better in person, ha?

01:34:22.047 --> 01:34:24.241
Very.

01:34:24.445 --> 01:34:26.594
Adriana say hello to the Senor.

01:34:31.362 --> 01:34:32.589
It's all there.

01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:36.953
The money is all there

01:34:37.359 --> 01:34:40.190
Good.
Come here.

01:34:41.357 --> 01:34:43.153
She's a little shy.

01:34:50.912 --> 01:34:52.902
Sit next to him.

01:35:06.724 --> 01:35:08.922
Where you from?

01:35:09.022 --> 01:35:11.240
Why you wanna know?

01:35:11.421 --> 01:35:13.219
No reason.

01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:14.135
No reason.

01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:17.727
Look you remind me of someone

01:35:17.898 --> 01:35:19.296
Who would that be?

01:35:20.137 --> 01:35:21.928
Some one I knew a long time ago.

01:35:22.136 --> 01:35:24.251
You're very nosey

01:35:24.314 --> 01:35:26.566
Are you a cop?

01:35:26.613 --> 01:35:28.567
No I'm not a cop.

01:35:28.612 --> 01:35:31.060
What do you think Manuel?
I think he's a cop.

01:35:31.212 --> 01:35:32.060
Get up!

01:35:34.029 --> 01:35:38.988
Look why don't you just give me the girl,
I'm telling you I'm not a cop

01:35:39.407 --> 01:35:40.481
Sit down.

01:35:40.486 --> 01:35:43.541
You're gonna prove you're not a cop

01:35:43.645 --> 01:35:45.816
Prove it how? How would I prove it?

01:35:45.824 --> 01:35:49.594
Easy, first fuck is here.

01:35:54.559 --> 01:35:55.359
Sorry?

01:35:55.519 --> 01:35:58.347
You gonna fuck the little virgin right here.

01:35:58.716 --> 01:36:01.553
That's not part of the deal.

01:36:01.555 --> 01:36:07.528
I know. But let's say it's kind
of my insurance policy.

01:36:07.593 --> 01:36:11.689
If you're not a cop, it means once
you've been with her you won't talk.

01:36:11.710 --> 01:36:15.187
But if you're a cop you wont
fuck her and then you're fucking death.

01:36:19.586 --> 01:36:21.018
You want some water?

01:36:25.344 --> 01:36:28.414
So, what's it gonna be?

01:36:32.459 --> 01:36:35.734
I think, for this amount of money
I deserved a little private.

01:36:35.977 --> 01:36:41.007
Sure,
you can get your very own room

01:36:41.068 --> 01:36:42.520
No, no, no,

01:36:56.068 --> 01:36:58.920
Go with him.

01:37:03.083 --> 01:37:05.038
You go and be a nice little girl.

01:37:08.441 --> 01:37:14.558
Oh and ah...
I wanna see blood on the sheets.

01:37:52.538 --> 01:37:57.052
It's okay...
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:37:59.774 --> 01:38:05.049
Amigo...
I'm a friend of your brothers.

01:38:06.074 --> 01:38:07.849
Jorge...

01:38:08.170 --> 01:38:12.521
Jorge your brother, he's here with me.
We're gonna get you out.

01:38:12.528 --> 01:38:14.677
I'm not sure how exactly

01:38:23.562 --> 01:38:24.710
Wait.

01:38:45.751 --> 01:38:50.517
I don't trust this guy,
go check up them!

01:38:51.051 --> 01:38:52.017
Let's go!

01:39:30.063 --> 01:39:31.029
Manuel!

01:39:39.763 --> 01:39:44.629
Remember, Veronica is watching,
it's not to late.

01:40:39.212 --> 01:40:40.406
And?

01:40:51.966 --> 01:40:55.842
That son of a bitch has already justified
your so called insurance policy.

01:41:10.556 --> 01:41:15.068
Just what I like to see a satisfied customer

01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:17.468
Manuel is gonna take you back to your car.

01:41:37.542 --> 01:41:41.658
Adios Adriana,
good bye World Traveler.

01:41:55.213 --> 01:41:57.248
What a nice daddy.

01:42:12.037 --> 01:42:13.271
Jorge!

01:42:25.837 --> 01:42:28.271
Police! Police!
Drop your weapons!

01:42:35.353 --> 01:42:37.024
Don't move!
On the ground now!

01:42:40.469 --> 01:42:42.821
