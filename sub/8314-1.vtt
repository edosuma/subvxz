WOMAN: 'Big Ears, aye.

'This is Gathered Punch. Here we go.

00:50.080 --> 00:53.640
'Stay on the deck and keep it tight.
This is it.'

00:53.640 --> 00:56.000
'Rapid Angel, commence sortie.'

00:56.000 --> 00:57.880
'Rapid Angel, aye.'

01:01.680 --> 01:07.360
'Wow! Did you see that one? That'll
wait them up!' 'Perfect! Rotate out.

01:15.680 --> 01:23.320
'Very clean! Blockbuster, unload
the racks.' 'Blockbuster, aye.'

01:23.320 --> 01:26.520
'Let's see a nice tight pattern.'

01:26.520 --> 01:28.960

'Cross back over

01:55.120 --> 01:58.240
'Hit secondary targets

02:00.920 --> 02:03.840
'What was that?!'
'There's another one.

02:03.840 --> 02:09.039
'Someone, anyone, hit that missile
pad on the harbour. Who's got him?'

02:09.039 --> 02:13.520
'I see him! I'll take him

Get some heat flares out.'

02:27.280 --> 02:31.280
'I'm hit!' 'Can you get out to sea,
Rapid Angel?' 'I can manoeuvre,

02:31.280 --> 02:36.680

'Someone get that missile site now!'

02:36.680 --> 02:41.520
'My wing man is hit!'
'Rapid Angel, where are you?'

02:41.520 --> 02:47.160

me?' 'I copy, group leader.

on him, Nighthawk.' 'Roger that.'

03:11.680 --> 03:14.800

Captain.

03:16.480 --> 03:22.160
'Landfall. Someone's tracking me.
I'm losing power.' 'Stay with it.'

Andrei.

03:24.040 --> 03:27.440
'I'm losing power.'
'I've lost him. Splashdown!'

03:27.440 --> 03:31.160
RUSSIAN ACCENT: Your ship
was near the attack?

03:31.160 --> 03:38.120
The Leontiev was steaming
10km west of the USA Sixth Fleet.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.440
'Gibraltar...'

03:39.440 --> 03:45.240
Alert Naval Affairs, Captain.
A simple yes will do.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.960
I tracked the US plane
to crashpoint.

03:47.960 --> 03:52.400
I can estimate
its position to within 5km.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.960
You'll show me?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.280
You may want
to change your clothes.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.880
Captain, quick! We don't know
how much the Americans know.

04:05.920 --> 04:11.040
'Losing fuel.' 'Stay with him.'

04:11.040 --> 04:12.920
'There's landfall ahead.'

04:12.920 --> 04:15.520
'Someone's tracking me.
I'm losing power.'

04:15.520 --> 04:18.440
Come on! 'Stay with him.'

04:18.440 --> 04:21.360
'I'm losing power.' Come on!

04:21.360 --> 04:23.080
'I've lost him! Splashdown!'

04:23.080 --> 04:24.920
Man!

04:26.680 --> 04:29.640
Scratch 50 million worth
of F1-11!

04:29.640 --> 04:36.400
We lost more than that, Henderson.
Three of those planes had secret
laser guidance systems.

04:38.960 --> 04:44.840
And with our luck, one of those
babies is at the bottom
of the Mediterranean.

04:44.840 --> 04:50.840
We did a computer run
and it put splashdown three miles
south of Swatter Point, Malta.

04:50.840 --> 04:58.800
I'm gonna love Malta this time of
year. Not with the Soviet trawler
the Leontiev in the area.

04:58.800 --> 05:04.040
Fishing must be good! Do you want
to bet that I find that F1-11 first?

05:04.040 --> 05:09.200
I want to know the Leontiev
wasn't with the Sixth Fleet.

05:09.200 --> 05:14.280
Just track the trawler, Steve. Don't
be a hero. We're all heroes, Dean.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.960
That's why you love us.

05:22.760 --> 05:25.640
Is he the best man?

05:25.640 --> 05:28.640
Best man available.

05:28.640 --> 05:30.160
Explain that.

05:30.160 --> 05:36.800
Well, the best man for the job
is Ken Tani, codename Black Eagle.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.600
But he's on assignment.

05:40.360 --> 05:44.240
I don't care what it is,
pull him out.

05:44.240 --> 05:46.800
He's not available.

05:46.800 --> 05:51.440
Every year at this time,
he has two weeks to see his kids.

05:51.440 --> 05:54.000
That's our deal.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.680
He can see his kids later. You tell
him that. I won't tell him anything.

05:59.680 --> 06:04.000
Dean, make it happen...NOW!

06:14.000 --> 06:16.920
Get Patricia Parker for me.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.920
TANNOY: 'All passengers
on Pan-Am flight...'

06:21.920 --> 06:23.000
Boys!

06:26.080 --> 06:31.640
Patricia Parker is taking you to
your father. Hi! You must be Denny.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.120
Hi. And Brian? Hello.

06:34.120 --> 06:39.920
I know your dad was supposed to be
here but he has a project on Malta.

06:39.920 --> 06:43.320
So get your things,
we've got a plane to catch.

06:44.480 --> 06:49.800
'Passengers on Flight 228
from Madrid, please proceed to...'

07:02.680 --> 07:03.880
Buongiorno.

07:03.880 --> 07:07.080
Buongiorno. Sono Padre Bedelia.

07:07.080 --> 07:11.040
Devo incontrare Monsignor Carraldi.

07:11.040 --> 07:15.080
Oh, that monsignor
won't be joining us today.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.160
I have a bottle of white wine,
unless you'd prefer coffee.

07:28.560 --> 07:29.960
What the hell do you want?!

07:29.960 --> 07:34.440
How's your research project
coming along?

07:34.440 --> 07:37.280
Maltese giving you much assistance?

07:37.280 --> 07:44.320
I was through with you 12 years ago.
14. Something's come up.

07:44.320 --> 07:48.040
I don't want to hear about it.
I'm a priest.

07:48.040 --> 07:51.280
A research oceanographer?

07:51.280 --> 07:54.120
Working on a grant
from Georgetown University?

07:54.120 --> 07:57.720
You Jesuits do take care of your own!

07:57.720 --> 08:00.960
Get someone else, Rickert.

08:03.440 --> 08:10.520
His name is Ken Tani. For all
intents and purposes, a marine
biologist at Hawaii University.

08:10.520 --> 08:13.440
You never let go.

08:15.560 --> 08:19.640
We may both get lucky.
I have a man on the scene.

08:19.640 --> 08:23.480
I may not need you or Tani.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.960
Get them alongside!

08:49.320 --> 08:51.080
Who sent you to my boat?

08:51.080 --> 08:52.720
Go fuck yourself!

08:54.000 --> 08:56.160
Captain! >

08:56.160 --> 09:00.440
Get back. Get back! Get back!

09:00.440 --> 09:05.080
Do you like wasting your time?
Wasting my time?!

09:05.080 --> 09:07.400
This was on the hull!

09:07.400 --> 09:11.960
So what? You know who he is
and what he wants.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.320
Are you in pain?

09:17.320 --> 09:19.320
Kiss my ass!

09:20.760 --> 09:23.800
Captain,

09:23.800 --> 09:27.440
where is your paramedic?
Argh!

09:40.960 --> 09:42.840
CRUNCH

09:49.600 --> 09:51.200
Captain, damn careless!

09:51.200 --> 09:55.160
How often do we get
a live one like him?

10:02.800 --> 10:05.280
He was not alone.

10:05.280 --> 10:09.280
Take this body away! Captain!

11:20.240 --> 11:22.600
THEY CHEER

12:06.040 --> 12:08.920
Why was I pulled out two days early?

12:08.920 --> 12:13.000
You're not going to New York.
Whatever it is - no!
You're going to Malta.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.320
Dean, I get two weeks off
every summer, no matter what.

12:18.320 --> 12:24.920
Here's the gen on the SX1 laser
guidance system. I don't wanna know!

12:24.920 --> 12:26.640
I don't do enough for my kids!

12:26.640 --> 12:32.600
We know where the plane went down.
All you have to do
is get the guidance pod.

12:32.600 --> 12:39.800
Are you kidding? Malta's never easy.
It's crawling with spies
from all over the world.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.080
And the Leontiev.

12:42.080 --> 12:48.080
You think I'm walking into that?
You're out of your mind!
I'm going to meet my kids.

12:48.080 --> 12:51.200
That's exactly what you'll do, Ken.

12:51.200 --> 12:54.480
I know that tone of voice.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.560
Your kids are already in Malta.

12:56.560 --> 13:02.320
What?! At the Dragonara Palace
Hotel. Your luggage is there.
You registered yesterday.

13:09.960 --> 13:13.080
Brian? Brian!

13:13.080 --> 13:18.080
I bet my dad's never coming.
You're wrong. He's just busy.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.040
He's always busy!

13:21.840 --> 13:26.680
Let's try and enjoy ourselves.
We can go see the museum.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.000
Terrific(!)

13:29.000 --> 13:30.360
DISTANT CARNIVAL MUSIC

13:40.320 --> 13:43.120
Let's go watch the parade.

14:33.960 --> 14:38.600
I've got unidentified traffic
15 miles off Luca, heading west.

14:38.600 --> 14:43.680
Unidentified traffic north-east
of Malta, identify yourself.

14:43.680 --> 14:48.240
'Unidentified traffic north-east
of Malta, identify yourself.'

14:50.920 --> 14:54.200
'Malta Centre again.'

14:54.200 --> 14:58.800
The unidentified traffic is now
ten miles off Luca, heading west.

14:58.800 --> 15:02.680
Unidentified aircraft off Malta,
identify yourself!

15:12.360 --> 15:14.120
Open your chute!

15:14.120 --> 15:16.440
Pull, dammit!

15:45.640 --> 15:48.560
'The unidentified aircraft
has turned out to sea.'

16:12.080 --> 16:14.640
Hello. This is Chief Inspector Borg.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.360
Yes.

16:18.080 --> 16:23.800
Right. Give the area to my sergeant.
I'll send an officer.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.360
Hold the line.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.360
For you! Inspector?

16:29.040 --> 16:32.000
I don't want to hang around here.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.520
You are Father Joseph?
Clothes are in that duffle bag.

16:38.480 --> 16:41.880
Wallet, credit cards, passport -
all the goodies money can buy.

16:43.040 --> 16:49.320
Rickert said there was another
man - Henderson. Steve Henderson.

16:49.320 --> 16:52.560
He was to attach a homing device
to the Leontiev.

16:52.560 --> 16:56.000
Rickert gave me an assistant
to monitor it.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.440
What about it? Nothing, nada, niet!

17:00.440 --> 17:02.920
Nobody's seen Henderson.

17:04.200 --> 17:10.079
For what it's worth, I'm an
oceanographer. I study currents.

17:10.079 --> 17:11.520

17:49.880 --> 17:54.320
Dr Tani?
You work for Father Joseph.

17:54.320 --> 17:57.720
I do, but I'm employed by Mr Rickert.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.640
My boys are on the island?

18:00.640 --> 18:03.880
They're at the Medina Museum.

18:03.880 --> 18:09.760
This picture shows the Grand Master
defeating the Turks in 1565.

18:09.760 --> 18:12.520
A city is named after him.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.120
Daddy!

18:14.120 --> 18:18.960
How are you doing? I am very glad
to see you. Both of you!

18:20.400 --> 18:23.720
How long have you worn glasses?
Don't ask!

18:23.720 --> 18:27.600
Remember me? Patricia Parker.
Dean's friend.

18:27.600 --> 18:32.880
The tour's over. Let's step outside.

18:32.880 --> 18:36.920
We've been hoping you could join us.
That work wasn't too difficult.

18:36.920 --> 18:44.000
We've been here two days, Dad!
I'm sorry. I was busy, OK?

19:06.080 --> 19:09.960
Dr Tani, you may want to see this.

19:09.960 --> 19:13.120
I'll wait for you in the boat.

19:16.120 --> 19:21.280
Who is he? Vladimir Klimenko -
colonel in KGB. Sector commander.

19:21.280 --> 19:25.800
He flew in two days ago.
Now on the Leontiev. Hmm.

19:26.800 --> 19:31.560
Be careful, Doctor.
He's dangerous business.

this is where the F1-11 went down.

20:28.520 --> 20:32.080
I'm not getting anything from
the F1-11's emergency transponder.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.840
Let me help you with your tank.

20:37.840 --> 20:39.880
I don't use it.

20:39.880 --> 20:44.680
I've heard about divers who lower
their heart rate to stay underwater.

20:44.680 --> 20:47.520
Tell me about it sometime.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.240
It's a research vessel,

21:14.240 --> 21:18.280
chartered by Father Bedelia
of Georgetown University.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.760
That's an unusual operation here.

21:27.800 --> 21:31.960
Captain, diver in the water -
220m dead ahead.

21:31.960 --> 21:34.720
Shall I arm the depth charges?

21:36.680 --> 21:38.080
I'll let you know.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.840
Take us alongside!

22:16.920 --> 22:19.120
Have you been on this duty long?

22:25.480 --> 22:27.200
Do you like this job?

22:30.160 --> 22:31.360
I do now.

22:39.160 --> 22:40.600
Andrei!

22:49.200 --> 22:51.240
Get the camera.

22:53.360 --> 22:57.680
Ahoy there! Ahoy, Leontiev!

22:57.680 --> 23:03.160
Ahoy, Leontiev! Bear off!

23:14.320 --> 23:18.520

We're fine!

23:19.600 --> 23:21.440
Who is we?

23:21.440 --> 23:27.000
My research associate - Dr Tani.
Look at this!

23:27.000 --> 23:29.120
We have visitors.

23:32.040 --> 23:35.000
Marine life?

23:35.000 --> 23:36.920
Nothing to interest you, sir.

23:36.920 --> 23:39.520
Hardly of
a commercial size or grade,

23:39.520 --> 23:44.200
but then, these waters aren't
noted for their productivity.

23:44.200 --> 23:52.040
It's been six years since fishing
was a factor in the economic life

23:52.040 --> 23:55.080
of this island...

23:55.080 --> 23:57.040
Thank you!

23:57.040 --> 24:01.600
I shall pass the information
on to the Ministry of Fisheries.

24:01.600 --> 24:06.400
Unfortunately, the Ministry
waits a long time to take action.

24:07.120 --> 24:09.760
What's your project? Turpidity.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.640
Turpidity?

24:12.640 --> 24:16.120
These waters here...
Excuse me! Excuse me!

24:16.120 --> 24:21.480
Are you familiar with the 1983
Oceanography Congress in Stockholm?

24:21.480 --> 24:23.840
I'll look it up!

24:23.840 --> 24:26.920
What have you found on turpidity?

24:26.920 --> 24:33.600
I'll know when I collate the data.
But you will be gone by then, sir?

24:34.720 --> 24:37.440
You will know how to find us.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.000
All engines back!

24:54.640 --> 24:57.160
His name's Bedelia?

24:57.160 --> 25:01.120
B-E-D-E-L-I-A.

25:06.480 --> 25:12.280
Bedelia, Joseph. Born Connecticut.
Graduate Fordham University.

25:13.720 --> 25:16.440
But no Intelligence contact.

25:18.640 --> 25:22.440
Served in Vietnam from 1970-73.

25:22.440 --> 25:26.000
Entered seminary in 1974.
Ordained.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.040
Now this one.

25:35.160 --> 25:38.720
Kenji Tani. Born Nara, Japan.
US citizen.

25:38.720 --> 25:40.600
I can read it!

25:41.880 --> 25:44.000
Not enough information.

26:00.680 --> 26:04.160
I'm returning to station.
We can still put divers down.

26:04.160 --> 26:06.960
Where we saw the Japanese.

26:06.960 --> 26:09.080
Your people said there!

26:09.080 --> 26:12.800
My own people are not on the sea!

26:12.800 --> 26:15.320
'Get word to the Embassy,

26:15.320 --> 26:19.560
'I want a surveillance team in place
when Bedelia's boat comes in.'

26:25.040 --> 26:31.280
TOUR GUIDE: This is
the Grand Masters' Palace.
It was built in 1574.

26:31.280 --> 26:37.320
Here's a statue of Neptune.
Follow me and I'll show you
the rest of the palace -

26:37.320 --> 26:41.840
the dining room, the bone room
and the tapestry chamber.

26:48.600 --> 26:53.120
All the weapons and suits of armour
are original

26:53.120 --> 26:58.360
and were used during the Great Siege
of 1565 against the Turks.

26:59.440 --> 27:04.400
It's more fun with you, Daddy.
There are things I had to do.

27:07.600 --> 27:10.720
I just have one more thing
to do tomorrow.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.120
Hey! If I'm lucky, that's it!

27:14.120 --> 27:16.920
My time will be all yours.

27:16.920 --> 27:23.120
Promise? I'll do the best I can.
That's all I can promise. OK, Daddy.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.400
We have company.

27:28.400 --> 27:31.320
The one with a moustache
and the one with a beard.

27:33.640 --> 27:40.440
Peter can handle this. I'll take
care of it. I'll stay with the boys.

27:41.720 --> 27:49.120
We have had 28 Grand Masters
and the first Grand Master...
Wow! Look at those guys!

27:49.120 --> 27:56.040
Excuse me, please.
The Grand Master here is a head
of state, a prime minister...

28:03.640 --> 28:10.040
Hey, where's my dad?
He'll catch up with us later.
Him and his promises!

31:33.320 --> 31:34.680
GUNSHOT

32:18.600 --> 32:21.560
Arghhh!

32:22.440 --> 32:24.240
WOMAN SCREAMS

32:48.440 --> 32:54.280
Here's your father. Where did you
go? I had to make a phone call.

32:54.280 --> 33:00.320
Can we go back to the beach now?
Back to the hotel now.
We'll hit the beach tomorrow.

33:00.320 --> 33:04.880
Sure you can make it(?)
I'll be there.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.960
Stop!

33:22.960 --> 33:24.920
Sonia,

33:24.920 --> 33:27.840
superimpose the tape
from the palace.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.560
Patricia Parker. Born 1960.

33:36.560 --> 33:41.280
Employee of Central Intelligence
Agency since 1981.

33:41.280 --> 33:44.200
Assigned to Korea, escort duties.

33:44.200 --> 33:49.960
Qualified in small arms,
automobile, aircraft, explosives
and electronic transmissions.

33:52.840 --> 33:55.320
I don't think she's important.

33:55.320 --> 33:58.440
Uh-uh, but now we know that HE is.

33:59.480 --> 34:06.000
Aren't you suspicious
that these Russians
both died violent deaths?

34:06.000 --> 34:09.600
I make no assumptions.
Excuse me.

34:11.600 --> 34:14.560
'But this national security case...'

34:14.560 --> 34:19.320
Hey! That was interesting!
Come on, you need your sleep.

34:19.320 --> 34:22.400
Goodnight, boys.

34:26.159 --> 34:32.840
Hey, Dad! How did you get here on
the island? By plane, same as you.
See you in the morning.

34:36.840 --> 34:40.920
Peter will look after the boys.
Am I going somewhere?

34:40.920 --> 34:46.800
We both are. There was a message
for us to be at the casino at 9pm.

34:46.800 --> 34:49.199
I don't know who sent it.

34:49.199 --> 34:51.760
Let's find out. Uh-huh.

35:02.160 --> 35:05.560
THEY SPEAK RUSSIAN

35:07.360 --> 35:09.880
Here they come.

35:12.120 --> 35:17.520
CROUPIER: Rien ne va plus!
Place your bets.

35:20.960 --> 35:23.480
Make a play, Andrei.

35:23.760 --> 35:26.000
Your play.

35:26.000 --> 35:31.520
Part of your project, Dr Tani?
Is it Captain Klimenko?

35:31.520 --> 35:33.560
Colonel.

35:33.560 --> 35:36.720
This is Miss Patricia Parker.

35:36.720 --> 35:40.400
I know quite a bit about Miss Parker.

35:40.400 --> 35:47.720
It's not often I meet a woman who
scores 96 on a Langley firing range.

35:47.720 --> 35:51.320
And is rated triple-A1
as a radio operator.

35:53.280 --> 35:57.200
You're confusing me
with someone else, Colonel.

36:01.720 --> 36:04.520
Make a play!

36:05.680 --> 36:07.640
I don't gamble, Doctor.

36:07.640 --> 36:14.720
It goes against logic
to take unnecessary risks
with so little chance of success.

36:21.880 --> 36:25.880
Tac-toe. Le rouge.
Evens in red.

36:25.880 --> 36:30.320
What do you know,
we came up a winner!

36:30.320 --> 36:33.120
Of course! You backed red!

36:38.200 --> 36:40.240
Let's go back to the hotel.

36:55.920 --> 36:59.400
We're ahead!
The best time to cash in your chips!

36:59.400 --> 37:04.280
Besides, I know a warning
when I hear one.

37:05.600 --> 37:09.840
Shall I check on the kids?
No, I'll do it. OK.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.680
Goodni...

37:15.880 --> 37:17.760
SHE MOUTHS

37:20.840 --> 37:23.680
Would you like a nightcap? Sure.

37:59.120 --> 38:01.760
GUNSHOTS

38:07.520 --> 38:10.880
Huh! Get the boys out!
Let's get out of here!

38:16.640 --> 38:22.320
Sit down, kids. Give me a minute. I
want to be sure we have no problem.

38:56.200 --> 38:58.080
ENGINE REVS

39:11.280 --> 39:14.440
SIREN WAILS

39:20.160 --> 39:22.200
I can't take it any more.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.720
I'm scared!

39:25.720 --> 39:28.440
Relax. Don't panic.

39:51.880 --> 39:56.200
Go on, go on! Everything's ready!

40:05.280 --> 40:07.600
I must check
something.

40:07.600 --> 40:10.480
Is everything OK? Yes. Good.

40:15.680 --> 40:21.640
Dad? Go with Peter, Brian.
Get some rest.

40:21.640 --> 40:24.200
Dad, is someone trying to hurt you?

40:25.240 --> 40:31.160
I am doing a job for our country.
They asked me to find something.

40:31.160 --> 40:34.880
But some people
don't want you to find it?

40:34.880 --> 40:36.680
Yes.

40:36.680 --> 40:39.640
They are bad men, aren't they?

40:39.640 --> 40:42.720
They probably think we are bad men.

40:46.080 --> 40:48.400
There's a lot you're not telling me.

40:48.400 --> 40:51.320
There is a lot I cannot tell you.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.160
Please understand.

41:05.560 --> 41:07.320
Goodnight, Dad.

41:13.280 --> 41:15.200
Goodnight.

41:25.240 --> 41:28.960
Tell Rickert, I don't care
where they come from,

41:28.960 --> 41:33.520
I want more people here
to look after my boys!

41:47.240 --> 41:51.920
I understand you are
to be congratulated.

41:51.920 --> 41:59.160
That can wait till the
laser system is on board
one of our submarines.

41:59.160 --> 42:01.040
There's been a change.

42:02.920 --> 42:06.920
You are to deliver
the apparatus on the Gorky.

42:08.800 --> 42:10.520
I wish to protest.

42:11.400 --> 42:14.880
The Americans would have
no compunction

42:14.880 --> 42:17.960
blowing a fishing
trawler out of the water.

42:17.960 --> 42:23.680
The Gorky is
a 10,000-tonne cargo vessel.

42:23.680 --> 42:27.000
Almost a luxury vessel.

42:28.920 --> 42:31.640
I'll see it's done.

42:42.240 --> 42:44.240
Come on, boys.

42:46.880 --> 42:50.360
This is business. Go with Peter. OK?

43:19.560 --> 43:21.640
You did pretty good.

43:21.640 --> 43:25.600
Another of your skills? Not me!
I'm scared shitless of heights.

43:26.640 --> 43:28.320
Be careful.

43:28.320 --> 43:31.400
Don't worry. You be careful.

43:31.400 --> 43:36.320
Dean's sending more men. He didn't
want to use anyone from the Embassy.

43:36.320 --> 43:39.640
I'll look after your sons for you.

47:10.920 --> 47:15.040
IN RUSSIAN

47:28.480 --> 47:34.120
How many times?! Father Joseph wanted
samples! There are his flasks!

47:39.040 --> 47:41.680
HE SHOUTS IN RUSSIAN

48:24.760 --> 48:28.040
HE SHOUTS IN RUSSIAN

48:44.120 --> 48:45.640
Urgh! Come on!

49:02.280 --> 49:04.720
EXPLOSION

49:16.280 --> 49:18.080
Come on. Hup!

49:20.360 --> 49:22.640
Arrgh! OK!

49:30.640 --> 49:33.800
THEY PANT

49:42.400 --> 49:45.840
All right? I'm alive, thanks to you.
HORN BLARES

49:47.360 --> 49:50.760
Let's go.
Father Joseph should be waiting.

50:08.800 --> 50:11.200
There's a hidden entrance
to the grotto.

50:18.120 --> 50:23.720
Look for it now. There it is!

50:40.800 --> 50:44.440
CHURCH BELLS RING

50:46.520 --> 50:53.040
Welcome to the Malta Subways.
There's no graffiti! Give us time!

50:54.200 --> 50:56.560
Father! Father!

50:56.560 --> 51:00.400
My mother enjoyed the service today.

51:00.400 --> 51:04.240
Grazzi. Grazzi.
Please give her your blessing.

51:04.240 --> 51:06.920
Thank you, Father.

51:06.920 --> 51:10.080
Father! Father...

51:10.080 --> 51:16.480
You'll never believe it!
I didn't doubt you for a second!
Right up those steps.

51:16.480 --> 51:20.120
IN MALTESE

51:20.120 --> 51:22.000
Bless you. Grazzi.

51:22.000 --> 51:26.040
Peace be with you.
Thank you, Father. I must go.

51:35.800 --> 51:38.600
WATER DRIPS

52:02.680 --> 52:06.080
Ken? Ken?

52:06.080 --> 52:08.200
Tani?

52:08.200 --> 52:11.800
I'm right here. Come on.

52:17.880 --> 52:22.680
I was only inches from you -
I didn't hear or feel anything!

52:22.680 --> 52:25.480
You weren't supposed to.

52:43.240 --> 52:46.280
PARADE MUSIC PLAYS

53:16.400 --> 53:20.960
Dean Rickert sent me! He did?!
He flew in this morning.

53:24.800 --> 53:27.960
Let's go down to the beach. OK? Yes.

53:35.560 --> 53:43.040
Your father can take care of
himself, Brian. This is what he
does? Things like this?

53:44.400 --> 53:45.640
We really should go.

53:45.640 --> 53:50.160
You work with him. Please, Brian.

53:52.280 --> 53:56.600
That's all you care about -
your jobs. Nothing else matters.

53:56.600 --> 54:03.320
A great deal matters -
the people we're connected to,
the people at home.

54:03.320 --> 54:07.840
Your father loves you.
That's what he cares about.

54:07.840 --> 54:10.240
Then where is he?

54:10.240 --> 54:13.320
Doing his best for you and Denny.

54:15.680 --> 54:17.280
Please, Brian.

54:24.040 --> 54:26.160
Here he comes.

54:26.160 --> 54:30.080
I hope you have some souvenirs
for me. Only one -

54:30.080 --> 54:34.080
the warhead guidance system,
from pathway to missile.

54:35.080 --> 54:39.360
Dammit, I want Rapid Angel.
So do the Russians!

54:39.360 --> 54:42.760
The bay compartment was empty.

54:42.760 --> 54:45.640
It's still here on these islands!

54:45.640 --> 54:49.600
Did you get a flash from Klimenko?
We intercepted a message

54:49.600 --> 54:55.120
sending the Gorky back to Odessa as
soon as it leaves dry dock in Malta.

54:58.160 --> 55:06.640
You're grasping at straws. Rapid
Angel may be in a diplomatic pouch
or on an Ilyushin going to Moscow.

55:06.640 --> 55:11.120
We have every plane covered
in this area.

55:11.120 --> 55:15.600
If Klimenko has Rapid Angel,
he'll put it aboard the Gorky,

55:15.600 --> 55:19.640
then onto to a sub
between here and the Black Sea.

55:19.640 --> 55:23.440
Where did the sub come from?
Odessa.

55:23.440 --> 55:28.800
It's now passing through the
Hellespont. You have two days.

55:28.800 --> 55:31.920
My deal was the F1-11. I delivered.

55:31.920 --> 55:36.720
The job is only half done!
You'll tell me how it turns out.

55:36.720 --> 55:41.720
Dammit, people have died! Tell me
about it! I killed six of them!

55:41.720 --> 55:49.400
Tell him to put his gun away,
Rickert! I don't want
to punch his fucking lights out.

55:52.640 --> 55:55.240
All right. Come on!

56:05.120 --> 56:09.040
All right, call it! I want my kids
off this island.

56:09.040 --> 56:11.520
Come on, you son of a bitch!

56:11.520 --> 56:17.040
It paid off for you. They got me
here, but now it's phase two time.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.560
You send them home.

56:18.560 --> 56:23.200
You know what can happen
if we don't stop Klimenko.
You don't have time for this.

56:24.560 --> 56:29.640
All right. They fly out with me.
I'll put men on them
and put them anywhere you like -

56:29.640 --> 56:35.240
Rome, London, New York. They are due
at Fort St Michael at one o'clock.

56:35.240 --> 56:40.760
Call the Embassy. You meet the kids
and pick up their luggage.
Yes, sir.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.560
Want to go for another boat ride?

56:51.560 --> 56:53.560
Boys!

56:54.600 --> 56:56.040
Boys!

56:56.040 --> 56:59.680
That's it for beach time.
Let's go.

57:00.720 --> 57:03.640
Take that! Hey!

57:08.920 --> 57:15.400
SHIP'S TANNOY:
'We are now entering the creek and
in the harbour is the dry dock.

57:15.400 --> 57:18.960
'It's the main industry in Malta.'

57:18.960 --> 57:21.320
You can just see the ship.

57:21.320 --> 57:25.920
INDISTINCT SPEECH OVER TANNOY

57:31.360 --> 57:34.600
HORN BLARES

57:44.560 --> 57:46.640
Here they come. Let's go.

57:52.240 --> 57:57.160
CHILDREN SCUFFLE AND GIGGLE

58:03.640 --> 58:06.040
Be ready!

58:07.320 --> 58:08.760
We'll be there soon.

58:08.760 --> 58:11.600
Not too close yet! Not too close!

58:16.240 --> 58:19.880
That large merchant ship
on the left is the Gorky.

58:19.880 --> 58:23.000
There should be very tight security.

58:32.360 --> 58:35.440
What are you guys doing?!

58:38.520 --> 58:42.280
Peter, will you pass
that car in front? Sure.

58:47.720 --> 58:52.400
The white car in back of us,
did it pass too? Yes.

58:54.360 --> 58:59.840
Boys, I want you to get down!
Brian, get down now!

59:00.880 --> 59:03.000
I think we got company!

59:03.000 --> 59:06.560
You said you were a good driver -
prove it!

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:23.080
Take the ones in back.
Put the gun on the floor.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:28.160
Now!
GUN CLATTERS TO THE FLOOR

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.000
MEN SHOUT ORDERS

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:43.760
You son of a bitch!

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:02.000
Miss Parker, I want Tani.
Right now, so do I!

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.960
Get inside. Come on.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:13.440
Take them to the fort outside
Medina. I'll see Klimenko. Get in.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.600
Denny...
SHE SPEAKS JAPANESE

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:51.400
DENNY SOBS

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.440
What's wrong?
Why's he crying?

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:57.840
The boys are frightened.
I'm trying to calm them.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:02.320
SHE SAYS A WORD IN JAPANESE
AND DENNY'S SOBS INCREASE

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.320
SHE SPEAKS JAPANESE

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.520
HORN TOOTS

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.920
Oh, my God,
I think he's gonna be sick.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.920
Get off!

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.920
Get after him, you fool!

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.120
I'm sorry. There's a guy chasing me.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:56.640
BOAT'S ENGINE DROWNS SPEECH

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:24.640
They're coming.
Ah - Dr Tani.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:31.920
I should like to know what you can
tell me about this. Nothing.

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:35.920
Nothing.
You checked out of the hotel.

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:39.000
A window was smashed. I paid for it.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.520
There are some bodies at the morgue
you might look at.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:47.200
I wouldn't know them.
You wouldn't know them(!)

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.480
Where are your children, Dr Tani?

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.560
Are you all right, Brian?

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.440
What did you tell to the police?

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:07.080
Nothing. I didn't want to till
I'd talked to you. You did right.

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:12.320
Do you know where Denny
and Patricia are? Yes.

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.240
Ssh!

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.760
HE SPEAKS JAPANESE

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:37.520
What he say? He says he has to go
to the bathroom.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:41.480
It's not the first time you wet your
pants. Come on.

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:45.000
You stay right there.
I wasn't gonna jump!

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.520
What was that?

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.920
Ha! Too skinny.

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:47.880
There's a landing
over by the west end.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.600
Hey! Somebody's thinking!

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:13.200
What were you doing?!
You're nothing but trouble.

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.680
CLINK!

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:45.320
CRUNCH!

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:01.240
Last time - you understand that?

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:03.600
Shut up!

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:27.120
THUD!
Vigo?

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:30.200
Vigo! >

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.439
< Vigo!

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.160
That way.

01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:01.439
Don't move.

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.840
SHE PANTS

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:25.640
Where's Denny? Right here. He's OK.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.680
We've got the boat.
We're going out here - come on.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.480
HE SHOUTS AN ORDER

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:06.160
Igor! >

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.920
Shit!

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.440
Hey! Aagh!

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.960
SHOT

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.880
GUNSHOT

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:36.240
GUNSHOT

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:01.920
Hyah!

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.880
Tsah!

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:09.200
THEY GRUNT

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:14.920
TANNOY: ..Present your passports
at gate two in the departure lounge.

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:20.080
Dad, when are you coming to Rome?
Soon. Make it quick.

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:24.600
TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:33.960
Come on. You can help me brush up
my Japanese. We'd better. You have
a terrible New York accent.

01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:59.800
I spoke to Dean. We're off the hook.
Where do you want to go now?

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:04.800
I want to scout out the Gorky.
OK. I can arrange that.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.480
GULLS CRY

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.120
Guess who's here.

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:19.360
WORKERS CHATTER

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:35.680
You didn't have to come.
Priests the world over
have put their lives on the line.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:38.280
I've been running away. That's over.

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:41.000
I haven't verified all these men!

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.920
If you want to get under way at 2200
hours, you'll need all these men.

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:50.640
Well, it's your responsibility.
Come on, lads.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:09.720
If they're sailing tonight,
Rapid Angel has to be on board.

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:14.920
There isn't time. We will make time.
I will check the captain's cabin.

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:19.520
Do your best to slow them down.
I'll check the navigation circuitry.

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.800
DOOR SQUEAKS

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:50.760
SNAP!

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:06.400
What are you doing?
Put your hands up!

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.600
CLATTER

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:17.720
They'll find him and know
we're here. No. They won't.

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:21.240
SNAP!

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:39.520
SHIP'S WHISTLE BLOWS

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:46.560
They'll find him. Not till morning.

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:59.880
Where to now? I will leave you here.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:03.680
Tell Lino to be in the harbour
at 2030 hours. And me?

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:08.280
You've done enough. You can't take
on Klimenko's people by yourself.

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:11.200
It calls for speed and timing.

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:18.960
One person - only one margin
for error. Two people...
There must be SOMETHING I could do.

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:37.320
WHISTLE BLOWS

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:52.920
BELL RINGS TWICE

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:57.280
We'll be getting under way
in ten minutes.

01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:59.840
I want no delays.

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:17.080
We are ready - OK.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:19.600
Ready for sea, Captain.

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:29.960
Prepare to cast off!

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.240
Casting off!

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:36.320
Prepare to cast off! >
BELL RINGS

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:48.120
All engines start.
Commence sweeping. Power all units.

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:52.240
There's a malfunction, sir.
I report the same, sir.

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:55.800
Something's wrong.
Check on it - now.

01:20:55.800 --> 01:21:00.400
Check below. Electronics and
communications officers to bridge.

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:35.160
All communications and navigation.
Tell the port authority
there's a ten-minute delay.

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:49.920
Give me the key to your cabin.
Your package is safe.
The key!

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:02.760
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:09.120
How bad is it?
It's sabotage to our
navigation equipment.

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:12.840
We cannot leave.
We must go.

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:19.280
Repairs will take 12 hours.
We can steer manually.
You have magnetic compasses.

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.960
It's impossible.
Impossible?!

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:33.640
Captain, I have seen governments
fall, nuclear weapons vanish
and captains disappear at sea.

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:36.120
There is nothing impossible.

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:42.560
HE SPITS

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.960
Are you mad?

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.440
ALARM WAILS

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:50.440
ALARM CONTINUES

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:14.440
Cut the power!

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:17.600
Andrei?

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.400
Let's leave it all.

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:36.040
HE SHOUTS AN ORDER

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:54.040
ALARM BLARES AGAIN AND MEN SHOUT

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:56.080
Look what I got!

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.360
Stay where you are!

01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:04.400
Don't shoot. Don't move!

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:05.840
Ken!

01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:14.120
What's going on? Kill them!

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:23.960
THEY SPEAK RUSSIAN

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:03.440
Hah!

01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.760
Andrei! >

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.880
I'm gonna blow it.

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.760
Natasha! Jump!

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:20.600
Get away! Jump now!

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:23.320
Jump!

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.080
Andrei?

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.440
Andrei!

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:44.920
Aagh!

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:48.880
No! No!

01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:26.080
It's loaded. One hundred per cent.

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:42.520
Swim, now.

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:44.440
To the boat.

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:35.280
We meet again, Dr Tani.

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:38.960
I take it your research project
is completed.

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:45.560
Quite. Then may I suggest
you leave these islands
by your first opportunity?

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:48.480
As you say, Inspector.
