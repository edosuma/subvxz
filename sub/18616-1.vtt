02:30.728 --> 02:32.595
- No, I don't know.
- A few people.

02:36.328 --> 02:38.260
I was... it was terrible.

02:38.261 --> 02:39.628
Tomorrow's will be better.

02:50.361 --> 02:52.027
I don't think I can say that.

02:52.028 --> 02:53.826
Say it in a public forum.

02:53.827 --> 02:55.568
I need... I need evidence.

03:13.397 --> 03:14.729
It's big, no?

03:20.263 --> 03:21.788
Ever since I entered physics,

03:22.161 --> 03:24.762
people have been talking about
this machine.

03:24.763 --> 03:27.430
The Large Hadron Collider,

03:27.431 --> 03:30.094
the biggest machine
ever built by human beings,

03:30.095 --> 03:32.562
is finally going to turn on.

03:32.563 --> 03:36.662
And after many, many years

03:36.663 --> 03:39.029
of waiting and theorizing

03:39.030 --> 03:40.828
about how matter got created

03:40.829 --> 03:43.695
and about what
the deep fundamental theory

03:43.696 --> 03:45.396
of nature is...

03:45.397 --> 03:49.028
all those theories
are finally going to be tested,

03:49.029 --> 03:50.863
and we're gonna know something.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.863
And we don't know
what it's gonna be now,

03:52.865 --> 03:54.230
but we will know,

03:54.231 --> 03:55.915
and it's gonna change
everything.

03:58.162 --> 04:01.764
And if the LHC
sees new particles,

04:01.765 --> 04:04.031
we're on the right track.

04:04.032 --> 04:07.898
And if it doesn't, not
only have we missed something,

04:07.899 --> 04:13.665
but we may not ever know
how to proceed.

04:14.664 --> 04:16.562
We are at a fork in the road,

04:16.563 --> 04:20.264
and it's either going to be
a golden era...

04:20.265 --> 04:21.930
Oh!

04:21.930 --> 04:24.864
Or it's going to be quite stark.

04:24.865 --> 04:29.331
And I've never heard of
a moment like this in history,

04:29.332 --> 04:34.197
where an entire field
is hinging on a single event.

04:34.198 --> 04:35.498
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:35.499 --> 04:36.764
- I'm David.
- I'm Fabiola.

04:36.765 --> 04:38.398
Fabiola, nice to meet you.

04:38.399 --> 04:41.865
- So, look, I have suggested
to be on this side

04:41.866 --> 04:44.830
because this big wheel
is quite spectacular.

04:44.831 --> 04:47.332
Yeah, yeah.

04:47.333 --> 04:48.730
More than ever,

04:48.731 --> 04:50.565
this will require
the collaboration

04:50.566 --> 04:52.598
between the theory
and experimentalists,

04:52.599 --> 04:53.879
so it would be
a very nice period

04:54.065 --> 04:55.998
where we work together and,
uh...

04:55.999 --> 04:59.397
- Well, it's fun to finally
interact with experimentalists.

04:59.398 --> 05:01.533
I mean, I used to be
just in my office,

05:01.534 --> 05:04.706
coming up with, you know,
crazy ideas.

05:10.699 --> 05:12.499
It's a big thing.

05:12.500 --> 05:15.499
There is a general sense waiting
for this machine to start,

05:15.500 --> 05:19.833
this massive machine that has
taken so many years to build.

05:19.834 --> 05:23.533
We are all in great anticipation
of what it might find.

05:23.534 --> 05:25.899
And every time
there's even a rumor

05:25.900 --> 05:28.166
that a new particle
is discovered...

05:28.167 --> 05:30.365
even before it turns on...

05:30.366 --> 05:34.932
the entire field
goes into a fever pitch.

05:34.933 --> 05:39.934
The experiment was designed
initially in the mid '80s

05:39.935 --> 05:43.100
and has taken
this long to construct.

05:43.101 --> 05:47.900
There are 10,000 people
of over 100 nationalities.

05:47.901 --> 05:49.666
That includes countries

05:49.667 --> 05:51.767
which are mortal enemies
of each other,

05:51.768 --> 05:55.533
like India and Pakistan,
and Georgia and Russia,

05:55.534 --> 05:57.234
and Iran and Israel.

05:57.235 --> 06:00.167
All have physicists
working on this machine.

06:00.168 --> 06:03.003
These big blue things
are 7-ton

06:04.002 --> 06:05.768
superconducting magnets,

06:05.769 --> 06:08.435
which have to be cooled
with liquid helium

06:08.436 --> 06:10.601
to the coldest temperatures
on Earth,

06:10.602 --> 06:12.001
colder than empty space.

06:13.001 --> 06:16.402
There are 100,000 computers

06:16.403 --> 06:20.101
connected all over the world
to deal with the data.

06:20.103 --> 06:22.868
In fact, the worldwide web
was invented at CERN

06:22.869 --> 06:24.402
so that physicists
all over the planet

06:24.403 --> 06:26.234
could share the data.

06:26.235 --> 06:29.902
The United States was building
a machine just like this,

06:29.903 --> 06:33.069
in fact, a bigger machine,
in Texas,

06:33.070 --> 06:37.535
but they ran into
a small technical difficulty.

06:37.536 --> 06:42.269
- I doubt anyone believes
that the most pressing issues

06:42.270 --> 06:48.035
facing the nation include
an insufficient understanding

06:48.035 --> 06:50.935
of the origins of the universe.

06:50.935 --> 06:54.270
- Unfortunately, the
Superconducting Super Collider

06:54.271 --> 06:57.769
was canceled by Congress
in 1993.

06:57.770 --> 06:59.834
- And finally, he's saying,
"Well, if we don't do it,

06:59.836 --> 07:01.535
the Europeans will do it."

07:01.536 --> 07:03.403
Let them do it!

07:03.404 --> 07:05.569
We'll steal their technology
like they steal our technology.

07:05.570 --> 07:08.335
It got very political.

07:08.336 --> 07:13.003
It was very expensive,
very complicated.

07:13.004 --> 07:15.337
It's hard for physicists
to explain

07:15.338 --> 07:18.069
why we do
these kinds of experiments.

07:18.070 --> 07:22.268
The purpose of the machine
is not military application.

07:22.270 --> 07:24.436
It's not commercial application.

07:24.437 --> 07:28.270
It's to understand something
about the basic laws of physics.

07:28.271 --> 07:31.371
There are two kinds
of particle physicists:

07:31.372 --> 07:33.271
there are the experimentalists.

07:33.272 --> 07:37.070
They built the big machines,
run the experiments,

07:37.071 --> 07:39.905
analyze the data,
and try to discover things,

07:40.905 --> 07:43.405
like new particles;

07:43.406 --> 07:46.905
And then there are
the theorists, like me.

07:47.903 --> 07:50.037
We construct the theories

07:50.038 --> 07:53.537
that try to explain everything
we see in nature.

07:53.538 --> 07:58.037
Without us, the experimentalists
are in the dark,

07:58.038 --> 08:00.105
but without them,

08:00.106 --> 08:02.541
we'll never know the truth.

08:05.672 --> 08:07.737
- I mean, if you go,
it won't be so terrible.

08:07.738 --> 08:10.005
When I was at Stanford,
I had a mentor:

08:10.006 --> 08:12.437
Savas Dimopoulos.

08:12.438 --> 08:16.672
Savas only likes to work
on the biggest puzzles.

08:16.673 --> 08:18.539
Now, just for fun,

08:18.540 --> 08:21.671
I wanted to tell you that the
enabling technologies that...

08:21.671 --> 08:24.272
- He has
some of the most famous theories

08:24.273 --> 08:26.405
that will be tested at the LHC,

08:26.406 --> 08:30.240
but he doesn't know
if any of them are true,

08:30.241 --> 08:33.773
so there's an intensity with
which he approaches physics.

08:33.774 --> 08:37.405
If he works on a paper that
could result in a Nobel Prize,

08:37.407 --> 08:40.272
he doesn't allow more
than three people on the paper,

08:40.273 --> 08:42.337
because you can only share
the Nobel Prize

08:42.339 --> 08:44.005
with three people.

08:44.006 --> 08:47.506
That's the level
at which he's operating

08:47.507 --> 08:49.541
and the impact
he's trying to have.

08:49.542 --> 08:52.066
- Takes us beyond the
confines of atomic physics.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.507
In particle physics,

08:54.508 --> 08:58.072
you have to have a threshold
amount of intelligence,

08:58.073 --> 09:00.739
whatever that means.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.272
But the thing
that differentiates scientists

09:03.273 --> 09:06.874
is purely an artistic ability

09:06.875 --> 09:11.507
to discern what is a good idea,

09:11.508 --> 09:13.173
what is a beautiful idea,

09:13.174 --> 09:15.607
what is worth spending time on,

09:15.608 --> 09:18.739
and, most importantly,

09:18.740 --> 09:23.840
what is a problem that
is sufficiently interesting,

09:23.842 --> 09:26.174
yet sufficiently difficult

09:26.175 --> 09:28.873
that it hasn't yet been solved,

09:28.874 --> 09:34.574
but the time
for solving it has come now?

09:58.177 --> 10:00.741
- So people have been waiting
for this experiment,

10:00.742 --> 10:02.778
the LHC, for a very long time.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.174
Nothing like it
has ever happened.

10:05.175 --> 10:06.674
All the superlatives
are justified.

10:06.675 --> 10:09.842
This is the case
where the hype is...

10:09.844 --> 10:11.741
the hype
is approximately accurate.

10:11.742 --> 10:14.276
To get, you know, 3,000 people

10:14.277 --> 10:15.708
to work
on an experiment together,

10:15.709 --> 10:17.408
whose goal is to understand

10:17.409 --> 10:19.575
what's going on at distances
a thousand times smaller

10:19.576 --> 10:21.242
than the proton...

10:21.243 --> 10:24.210
this is... this is a really
extraordinary testament

10:24.211 --> 10:28.842
to what...
to some of the highest ideals

10:28.843 --> 10:31.109
we can have as human beings.

10:31.110 --> 10:32.777
It's...

10:32.778 --> 10:35.776
- Nima and I got our PhDs
around the same time.

10:35.776 --> 10:37.575
He's a couple years ahead of me.

10:37.576 --> 10:41.711
And Nima
is the star of our generation,

10:41.712 --> 10:45.611
and he's the guy we all followed
and looked up to

10:45.612 --> 10:47.008
and tried to keep up with

10:47.009 --> 10:50.082
and tried to outpace
if we could.

10:54.078 --> 10:55.842
Since the mid '70s,

10:55.843 --> 10:58.577
we've had an amazingly
successful theory of nature

10:58.578 --> 11:01.211
that we call the Standard Model
of particle physics.

11:01.212 --> 11:03.877
But sitting in the heart
of the theory is a sickness,

11:03.878 --> 11:07.444
very, very glaring
conceptual problems

11:07.446 --> 11:09.654
that infected
this fantastic understanding.

11:11.544 --> 11:13.877
Why is the universe big?

11:13.878 --> 11:16.544
Why is gravity so much weaker
than all the other forces?

11:16.545 --> 11:19.277
The kinds of answers that this
theory gives to these questions

11:19.278 --> 11:21.878
seems so patently absurd

11:21.879 --> 11:26.111
that we think that we're missing
something very, very big.

11:26.112 --> 11:28.244
And on top of all of that,

11:28.245 --> 11:30.412
there is one prediction
of this theory...

11:30.413 --> 11:32.011
absolutely crucial
for it to even make

11:32.012 --> 11:34.111
internal theoretical sense...

11:34.112 --> 11:36.578
and this is
the famous Higgs particle.

11:36.579 --> 11:38.378
The Higgs, or something like it,
must show up.

11:38.379 --> 11:39.880
If it doesn't show up,

11:39.881 --> 11:42.211
there's something
truly, deeply wrong,

11:42.212 --> 11:43.545
very, very, deeply wrong

11:43.546 --> 11:45.412
with the way
we think about physics.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.846
There are strong reasons

11:46.847 --> 11:48.211
to think that some
of these questions

11:48.212 --> 11:50.279
will find answers at the LHC.

11:50.280 --> 11:51.711
There's been no shortage
of ideas

11:51.712 --> 11:54.079
for what they might be,

11:54.080 --> 11:57.546
but this is really
this generation of people's...

11:57.547 --> 11:59.545
my generation of people's...
only shot.

12:12.414 --> 12:14.580
Ah, so the boss comes.

12:23.249 --> 12:26.613
I first came to CERN in 1987.

12:26.614 --> 12:29.745
I was a very young
undergraduate student,

12:29.746 --> 12:32.748
and I remember the first time
I entered the site.

12:32.749 --> 12:35.281
I was a bit scared
by the corridors

12:35.282 --> 12:37.781
in the CERN main site,

12:37.782 --> 12:40.548
so I was almost lost
in those corridors.

12:40.549 --> 12:42.280
For me, it has been
a wonderful experience,

12:42.281 --> 12:44.013
because I had the chance
of being involved

12:44.014 --> 12:45.780
right from the beginning

12:45.781 --> 12:49.781
and to see, really, an
experiment from starting and...

12:49.782 --> 12:51.448
from zero, essentially.

12:51.449 --> 12:53.248
- I've seen two inventors
place out of the ten,

12:53.249 --> 12:54.681
and we probably have seen...

12:54.682 --> 12:56.215
- I don't think
I can describe right now

12:56.216 --> 12:58.080
the excitement about first beam.

12:58.081 --> 13:00.514
I mean, the entire control room

13:00.515 --> 13:04.948
is like a group
of six-year-olds

13:04.949 --> 13:07.416
whose birthday is next week,
you know,

13:07.417 --> 13:08.782
and there's going to be cake,

13:08.783 --> 13:10.381
and there's going to be
presents,

13:10.382 --> 13:12.047
and all their friends
are going to be there,

13:12.048 --> 13:13.517
and they just, you know...

13:13.517 --> 13:16.115
they just know
it's going to be great.

13:16.116 --> 13:18.181
You know,
they're kind of scattered,

13:18.182 --> 13:20.414
and I can't imagine, 'cause
they're not that big, right?

13:20.415 --> 13:21.849
I've been a postdoc here
for a year,

13:21.849 --> 13:23.214
so I'm a relative newcomer.

13:23.215 --> 13:24.898
But my timing
is sort of perfect.

13:25.583 --> 13:27.283
I mean,
to be on the ground floor

13:27.284 --> 13:28.882
when the data first comes...

13:28.883 --> 13:30.115
it's awesome.

13:30.116 --> 13:32.549
That means I have 5,000 emails.

13:32.550 --> 13:34.915
There's a huge difference

13:34.916 --> 13:37.783
between theorists
and experimentalists.

13:37.784 --> 13:39.849
I mean, when I started college,

13:39.850 --> 13:43.382
I absolutely did not
want to do physics.

13:43.383 --> 13:45.803
Physics meant to me
everything that was boring:

13:46.550 --> 13:50.516
textbooks, theories, proofs.

13:50.517 --> 13:52.779
But then I discovered
the experimental side,

13:53.551 --> 13:57.518
and the experimental side
is the hands-on aspect.

13:57.519 --> 13:59.382
It's about taking a theory,

13:59.383 --> 14:03.250
which is abstract,
and making it real.

14:03.251 --> 14:04.829
How do you build an experiment

14:05.551 --> 14:09.385
to discover something
that the theory predicts?

14:09.386 --> 14:12.552
And that aspect is what I love.

14:27.253 --> 14:29.951
Of course, when constructing
the whole thing,

14:29.952 --> 14:31.884
we several times thought,

14:31.885 --> 14:34.784
"What if the whole thing
just does not work?"

14:34.785 --> 14:36.718
I really believe now
this will work,

14:36.719 --> 14:39.750
but the next thing is,
will we ever find something?

14:39.751 --> 14:42.752
So maybe we will
just find nothing new.

14:42.753 --> 14:45.052
It would be a catastrophe
for physics.

14:45.053 --> 14:46.917
We would, somehow...

14:46.918 --> 14:49.584
none of the open questions
which we have at the moment

14:49.585 --> 14:52.718
would've been answered.

14:52.720 --> 14:58.851
- So the LHC is basically the
most fundamental of experiments.

14:58.852 --> 15:01.620
It's like what any child
would design as an experiment.

15:01.621 --> 15:05.753
You take two things,
and you smash them together.

15:05.754 --> 15:08.684
And you get a lot of stuff that
comes out of that collision,

15:08.685 --> 15:11.919
and you try
to understand that stuff.

15:11.921 --> 15:13.785
Now, in this case,

15:13.786 --> 15:16.851
what we're smashing together
is tiny protons,

15:16.852 --> 15:20.353
which are inside the center
of every atom.

15:20.354 --> 15:23.118
And in order to get them
going as fast as possible,

15:23.119 --> 15:27.185
we have to build
this huge 17-mile ring,

15:27.186 --> 15:30.753
and we run those protons
around the ring multiple times

15:30.754 --> 15:34.420
to build up speed,
almost to the speed of light,

15:34.420 --> 15:37.719
and then we collide two beams
going in opposite directions

15:37.720 --> 15:39.621
at four points,

15:39.622 --> 15:42.953
and at those four points
are four different experiments:

15:42.954 --> 15:47.920
ATLAS, LHCb, CMS, and ALICE.

15:47.921 --> 15:49.888
Now, I work
on the ATLAS experiment.

15:49.889 --> 15:52.423
And ATLAS is like
a huge seven-story camera

15:53.421 --> 15:57.588
that takes a snapshot
of every single collision,

15:57.589 --> 16:00.355
and that's billions
of collisions.

16:00.356 --> 16:04.288
And the hope is that we'll see
the very famous Higgs particle.

16:04.289 --> 16:07.088
But every time we've turned on
the new accelerator

16:07.089 --> 16:08.521
at a higher energy,

16:08.522 --> 16:10.288
we've always been surprised.

16:10.289 --> 16:13.788
So the real hope
is that we'll see the Higgs,

16:13.789 --> 16:16.157
but that there's also something
amazingly new.

16:18.723 --> 16:23.889
- You can liken it to
when we put a man on the moon.

16:23.890 --> 16:25.586
It's that level
of collaborative effort.

16:25.587 --> 16:27.555
I would say,
even bigger than that.

16:27.556 --> 16:29.221
This is closer to something like

16:29.222 --> 16:31.954
human beings
building the Pyramids.

16:31.955 --> 16:33.422
Why did they do it?

16:33.423 --> 16:34.723
Why are we doing it?

16:34.724 --> 16:36.422
We actually have two answers.

16:36.423 --> 16:38.689
One answer
is what we tell people,

16:38.690 --> 16:41.523
and the other answer
is the truth.

16:42.757 --> 16:44.622
I'll tell you both.

16:44.623 --> 16:47.421
And there's nothing incorrect
about the first answer.

16:47.422 --> 16:50.355
It's just... it doesn't... it's
not the thing that drives us.

16:50.356 --> 16:52.122
It's not how we think about it,

16:52.123 --> 16:54.122
but it's something
you can say quickly,

16:54.358 --> 16:57.756
and the person you're talking to
won't, you know,

16:57.757 --> 17:01.123
<i>get diverted or pass out
or pick up the SkyMall catalog</i>

17:01.124 --> 17:03.555
if you happen to be next to them
on an airplane.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.089
Answer number one:

17:05.090 --> 17:09.189
we are reproducing the physics,

17:09.190 --> 17:12.191
the conditions,
just after the big bang.

17:12.192 --> 17:14.056
We're doing it in this collider,

17:14.057 --> 17:16.856
and we're reproducing that
so we can see what it was like

17:16.857 --> 17:18.623
when the universe just started.

17:18.624 --> 17:20.055
This is what we tell people.

17:20.057 --> 17:22.723
Okay, answer two:

17:22.723 --> 17:25.391
we are trying to understand
the basic laws of nature.

17:25.392 --> 17:27.957
It sounds slightly more mild,

17:27.958 --> 17:31.791
but this is really where we are
and what we're trying to do.

17:31.792 --> 17:35.223
We study particles,
because just after the big bang,

17:35.224 --> 17:37.424
all there was was particles,

17:37.425 --> 17:42.524
and they carried the information
about how our universe started

17:42.525 --> 17:45.391
and how it got to be
the way it is

17:45.392 --> 17:48.756
and its future.

17:48.757 --> 17:51.225
At the beginning of the 1900s,

17:51.226 --> 17:54.791
it became clear
that all known matter,

17:54.792 --> 17:56.591
everything that we know about,

17:56.592 --> 17:58.092
is made of atoms,

17:58.093 --> 18:01.626
and that atoms are made
of just three particles:

18:01.627 --> 18:05.628
the electron, the proton,
and the neutron.

18:07.626 --> 18:11.358
In the '30s,
other particles were discovered,

18:11.359 --> 18:13.426
and by the 1960s,

18:13.427 --> 18:15.459
there were hundreds
of new particles,

18:15.460 --> 18:18.426
with a new particle discovered
every week.

18:18.427 --> 18:21.058
And there was mass confusion,

18:21.059 --> 18:25.192
until a number
of theorists realized

18:25.193 --> 18:27.427
that there was a simple
mathematical structure

18:27.428 --> 18:30.225
that explained all of this,

18:30.226 --> 18:32.025
that most of these particles

18:32.026 --> 18:33.793
were made of the same
three little bits

18:33.794 --> 18:35.794
we call quarks,

18:35.794 --> 18:37.073
and that there are only
a handful

18:37.260 --> 18:39.126
of truly fundamental particles,

18:39.127 --> 18:42.058
which all fit together
in a nice, neat pattern.

18:42.059 --> 18:45.029
And there was born
the Standard Model.

18:48.026 --> 18:50.925
Eventually, all the particles
in the theory

18:50.926 --> 18:55.062
were discovered,
except one: the Higgs.

18:57.060 --> 19:01.226
And the Higgs
is unlike any other particle.

19:01.227 --> 19:04.559
It's the linchpin
of the Standard Model.

19:04.560 --> 19:08.294
Its theory was written down
in the 1960s by Peter Higgs

19:08.295 --> 19:10.760
and a number of other theorists.

19:10.761 --> 19:13.528
We believe
it is the crucial piece

19:13.529 --> 19:16.459
responsible
for holding matter together.

19:16.460 --> 19:20.760
It is connected to a field
which fills all of space

19:20.761 --> 19:24.261
and which gives particles,
like the electron, mass

19:24.262 --> 19:27.295
and allowed them
to get caught in atoms

19:27.296 --> 19:30.196
and thus is responsible
for the creation of atoms,

19:30.197 --> 19:32.795
molecules, planets, and people.

19:32.796 --> 19:36.230
Without the Higgs, life
as we know it wouldn't exist.

19:38.228 --> 19:40.061
But to prove that it's true,

19:40.062 --> 19:43.395
we have to smash particles
together at high enough energy

19:43.397 --> 19:48.062
to disturb the field
and create a Higgs particle.

19:48.063 --> 19:49.928
If the Higgs exists,

19:49.929 --> 19:53.128
the LHC is the machine
that will discover it.

19:53.128 --> 19:55.761
- Let's assume you're successful
and everything comes out okay.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.861
- Sure.
- What do we gain from it?

19:57.862 --> 19:59.463
What's the economic return?

19:59.463 --> 20:01.060
How do you justify all this?

20:01.061 --> 20:02.962
By the way, I am an economist.

20:02.963 --> 20:06.029
I don't hold it against you.

20:06.030 --> 20:10.030
The question
by an economist was,

20:10.031 --> 20:13.930
"What is the financial gain of
running an experiment like this

20:13.931 --> 20:17.529
and the discoveries that we
will make in this experiment?"

20:17.530 --> 20:19.963
And it's a very,
very simple answer.

20:19.964 --> 20:23.230
I have no idea.

20:23.231 --> 20:24.762
We have no idea.

20:24.763 --> 20:26.796
When radio waves
were discovered,

20:26.797 --> 20:28.728
they weren't called radio waves,

20:28.729 --> 20:30.629
because there were no radios.

20:30.630 --> 20:33.563
They were discovered
as some sort of radiation.

20:33.564 --> 20:37.362
Basic science
for big breakthroughs

20:37.363 --> 20:39.062
needs to occur at a level

20:39.063 --> 20:41.798
where you're not asking,
"What is the economic gain?"

20:41.799 --> 20:44.097
You're asking,
"What do we not know,

20:44.098 --> 20:45.898
and where
can we make progress?"

20:45.899 --> 20:49.062
So what is the LHC good for?

20:49.063 --> 20:52.963
Could be nothing other than
just understanding everything.

21:03.299 --> 21:06.364
- The first time
I ever saw ATLAS was in 2005.

21:06.365 --> 21:08.697
I had come out just to see
what ATLAS would look like

21:08.698 --> 21:11.231
because there was a possibility
that I could be working on it

21:11.232 --> 21:14.264
as a postdoc.

21:14.266 --> 21:17.931
I can remember walking in
and just being like...

21:17.932 --> 21:19.564
You know, just stunned.

21:19.565 --> 21:21.398
I mean, me, stunned,
you know, just, you know,

21:21.399 --> 21:23.464
already kind of having an idea
of the magnitude.

21:23.465 --> 21:25.764
People tell you,
"Oh, it's five stories tall."

21:25.765 --> 21:27.431
And you go, "Oh, okay,
five stories tall."

21:27.432 --> 21:29.298
And then you see.

21:29.299 --> 21:34.969
Five stories completely filled
with microelectronics...

21:37.967 --> 21:41.632
All custom designed,
all hand-soldered.

21:41.633 --> 21:46.267
You know, it's like as if
it's a five-story Swiss watch.

23:51.272 --> 23:53.604
- There was this issue
about the BCIDs.

23:53.605 --> 23:55.237
- We had our extended barrel
out earlier,

23:55.238 --> 23:58.403
but it should be back in,
and we should be...

23:58.404 --> 24:00.702
everything running normal.

24:00.704 --> 24:03.037
- Okay, so one more
announcement.

24:03.038 --> 24:05.738
We have to be extremely careful

24:05.740 --> 24:06.770
what we do to the system.

24:06.970 --> 24:08.471
I mean, we know that anybody

24:08.472 --> 24:10.770
who's even updating
a number somewhere

24:10.771 --> 24:13.570
might stop our system for
more than an hour quite easily.

24:13.571 --> 24:17.204
So please be absolutely sure
that you yourself

24:17.205 --> 24:19.737
and everybody in your system
is not touching the system,

24:19.738 --> 24:23.037
unless it's been agreed
by the shift leader, yeah?

24:23.039 --> 24:26.206
Nothing should be touched, yeah?

24:26.207 --> 24:27.639
And that includes all things

24:27.640 --> 24:29.105
that you're absolutely
dead certain

24:29.106 --> 24:30.790
they will not do anything wrong.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.106
Especially those things.

24:34.872 --> 24:38.603
- It's being called the
largest scientific experiment

24:38.604 --> 24:40.105
in history,

24:40.106 --> 24:43.038
and some say
one that could cause Armageddon.

24:43.039 --> 24:45.372
- It's the strangest
experiment ever:

24:45.373 --> 24:47.272
mankind's most ambitious attempt

24:47.273 --> 24:50.407
to understand
how we all got here.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.639
- Thousands of scientists
from around the world

24:54.640 --> 24:58.238
spent 20 years designing
an extraordinary machine.

24:58.239 --> 25:02.771
It cost £5 billion
and will switching on very soon.

25:02.772 --> 25:04.873
This is a genesis machine,

25:04.874 --> 25:06.141
a window on creation.

25:11.206 --> 25:14.140
Five months of testing on...

25:17.214 --> 25:20.107
- They're looking for something
called the God Particle,

25:20.108 --> 25:22.540
but skeptics are saying nobody
knows what will happen

25:22.541 --> 25:24.275
when they turn on the switch.

25:24.276 --> 25:27.207
- A group of French scientists
believe the collider

25:27.208 --> 25:28.705
might create a black hole

25:28.706 --> 25:30.607
that could swallow up the earth,

25:30.608 --> 25:34.110
and they filed suit to stop
the project from going forward.

25:38.041 --> 25:40.375
Hello?

25:40.376 --> 25:42.107
No, absolutely not.

25:42.108 --> 25:45.239
Well, no, there is no scientific
ground to what they say.

25:45.240 --> 25:48.274
It's not possible that the LHC
is going to destroy the world.

25:48.274 --> 25:49.808
It's absolutely ridiculous.

25:49.809 --> 25:52.040
Okay, it is 9:15.

25:52.041 --> 25:55.940
We are 15 minutes away
from beam.

25:55.941 --> 25:58.309
We've been sitting here,
about 7:00,

25:58.310 --> 26:01.642
and absolutely nobody
brought food.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.407
Again, 15 minutes to beam.

26:03.408 --> 26:04.775
<i>- Ciao, ciao.
- Stress levels are high.</i>

26:04.776 --> 26:06.375
<i>Ciao.</i>

26:06.376 --> 26:08.041
- But since I'm in a room
full of Italians,

26:08.042 --> 26:09.541
the stress level's
pretty cool here.

26:09.542 --> 26:10.942
But we have no coffee either.

26:10.943 --> 26:12.708
No coffee.
Who didn't bring coffee?

26:12.709 --> 26:14.240
What we're going to see today

26:14.241 --> 26:17.908
is the launch
of the first beam of protons

26:17.909 --> 26:20.409
around this enormous ring.

26:21.943 --> 26:25.408
Very shortly, Lyn Evans,
the project director,

26:25.409 --> 26:28.074
is going to be addressing
CERN staff,

26:28.075 --> 26:30.108
who are gathered
at different points

26:30.109 --> 26:33.475
around this massive complex.

26:33.476 --> 26:39.309
- It's just the first glimpse
at the fact the machine can run.

26:39.310 --> 26:40.877
I mean, so what you need,
really,

26:40.878 --> 26:42.576
is, you need two beams
colliding together

26:42.578 --> 26:44.276
for quite a few...

26:44.277 --> 26:46.209
quite a long period of time
before you calculate,

26:46.210 --> 26:47.743
get enough...

26:47.744 --> 26:50.443
sufficient statistics
in which to actually

26:50.444 --> 26:52.576
be able to look
for the new physics.

26:52.577 --> 26:54.643
But single beam,
the first beam, isn't even that.

26:54.644 --> 26:56.277
You're not even getting
any collisions.

26:56.278 --> 26:58.744
It's just one beam
going around in a circle,

26:58.745 --> 27:00.409
not even at the high energies.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.376
Just one beam going
around in the low energy circle,

27:02.377 --> 27:04.544
that sort of says, "Okay,
we made it around the ring once

27:04.545 --> 27:05.576
for the first time."

27:05.777 --> 27:07.311
And it's a huge event.

27:07.312 --> 27:09.311
Right, after 19 years,
you've been waiting

27:09.312 --> 27:10.975
for this first step.

27:10.976 --> 27:12.709
Let's get started, everybody.

27:12.711 --> 27:15.643
Now comes the day of reckoning.

27:15.644 --> 27:19.810
Five, four, three,

27:19.811 --> 27:22.743
two, one...

27:22.744 --> 27:25.143
Now.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.644
No beam.

27:28.610 --> 27:30.076
Yeah.

27:30.077 --> 27:33.977
So where are we
with the injection kicker?

27:33.978 --> 27:36.812
Oh, well...
they're out.

27:36.813 --> 27:39.811
Okay, never mind.

27:39.812 --> 27:41.310
Let's go.

27:41.311 --> 27:45.077
Five, four, three,

27:45.078 --> 27:49.245
two, one, zero.

27:56.746 --> 27:58.311
We get a beam on this pulse?

27:58.311 --> 28:00.646
I hope so.

28:13.481 --> 28:13.979
Yes!

28:30.014 --> 28:32.480
- Well, last night I was,
like, waking up constantly.

28:32.481 --> 28:34.045
Like, "Did we set that right?

28:34.046 --> 28:36.360
What about... did we disable...
oh, my gosh!"

28:40.079 --> 28:41.480
Marzio.

28:41.481 --> 28:44.212
I have a plot for you.

28:44.213 --> 28:46.311
Okay, check this out.

28:46.312 --> 28:47.714
This is Z.

28:47.715 --> 28:49.981
This is timing, in nanoseconds,

28:49.982 --> 28:51.815
which we knew
from the cosmic data.

28:51.816 --> 28:53.948
- That is very nice.
- Yes.

28:53.949 --> 28:56.379
- Upstairs, I think people
were more excited about this.

28:56.380 --> 28:59.146
- If you're in Google,
that means... that's the world.

28:59.147 --> 29:01.047
This is the most important thing
today.

29:01.048 --> 29:02.314
This is the first,

29:02.315 --> 29:03.648
and this tells us
a lot of things.

29:03.649 --> 29:05.313
It tells us that
the magnetic properties

29:05.314 --> 29:06.613
of the machine are good,

29:06.614 --> 29:08.313
that the aperture is clear.

29:08.314 --> 29:10.780
There's nothing is sticking into
the beam pipe anywhere.

29:10.781 --> 29:14.814
So a very, very encouraging sign
and remarkable progress.

29:14.815 --> 29:16.714
- Did you guys see
our beautiful plot?

29:16.715 --> 29:18.447
- What?
- Okay, I want to show you this.

29:18.647 --> 29:20.147
Come on, show them the plot.

29:20.148 --> 29:22.114
You can take a picture of...
here you go.

29:22.115 --> 29:24.481
Well, see if you can get it.

29:24.482 --> 29:25.815
I don't think
there's anyone else

29:25.816 --> 29:27.880
I can show my plot to, so...

29:27.882 --> 29:29.248
It worked.

29:29.249 --> 29:31.048
It just worked.

29:31.049 --> 29:33.315
And there are so few times
in life where it just works.

29:33.316 --> 29:35.715
And there are so
even fewer times in life

29:35.716 --> 29:38.549
where it just works great.

29:38.549 --> 29:39.816
We rocked.

29:39.816 --> 29:42.152
I mean, Tile, first beam...

29:44.151 --> 29:46.050
We destroyed that shit.

29:46.051 --> 29:48.382
They got a beam circulating.

29:48.383 --> 29:52.048
They've had beams circulating
for a full 30 seconds.

29:52.049 --> 29:53.283
So let me understand.

29:53.284 --> 29:56.382
This is one beam going one way?

29:56.383 --> 29:58.148
- They have one beam
going one way,

29:58.149 --> 30:00.282
and then they went to the
other beam going the other way.

30:00.282 --> 30:01.387
Well, does it work?

30:01.587 --> 30:03.216
The second beam,
did it go fully around?

30:03.217 --> 30:05.449
- Everything...
- they both went around.

30:05.450 --> 30:07.649
I think
they had the beam go around

30:07.650 --> 30:08.915
about a million times.

30:08.916 --> 30:10.384
Something like that.

30:10.385 --> 30:13.782
- Yeah, their Twitter feed
said 10 million.

30:13.783 --> 30:17.783
- Now we'll become, you know,
CERN Twitter junkies.

30:21.218 --> 30:23.249
I guess this is exciting.

30:23.250 --> 30:26.949
My logical self
wants to be excited.

30:26.950 --> 30:31.397
My psychological self
is very cautious.

30:45.384 --> 30:47.149
My parents are both Iranian

30:47.151 --> 30:50.251
and both physicists,

30:50.252 --> 30:54.418
and my father in particular
had real political difficulties

30:54.419 --> 30:55.553
with the regime,

30:56.552 --> 30:59.418
and we had to go underground
for a number of years,

30:59.418 --> 31:02.653
and we ended up escaping
from Iran

31:02.654 --> 31:06.819
through the border of Turkey.

31:06.820 --> 31:11.418
But then, through
a number of wonderful accidents,

31:11.419 --> 31:13.218
we ended up in Canada.

31:13.219 --> 31:15.917
I got interested in physics

31:15.918 --> 31:17.918
when I was 13 or 14 years old.

31:17.919 --> 31:21.451
It just offered the way
to combine the two things

31:21.452 --> 31:22.952
I really loved:

31:22.953 --> 31:25.753
mathematics
and things in the natural world.

31:25.754 --> 31:27.285
You almost done?

31:27.286 --> 31:29.051
Yeah.

31:29.052 --> 31:31.250
- It's just saying "What if?"
- It's, uh... yeah.

31:31.251 --> 31:33.118
- You're preparing
a broader audience for this.

31:33.119 --> 31:35.651
- Okay, now I'm going
to just do something fun.

31:35.652 --> 31:37.319
Just do something fun.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.453
What would be fun?

31:39.454 --> 31:41.086
- No, don't write "hell."
It's a public...

31:41.087 --> 31:42.587
All right, I'm sorry!

31:43.787 --> 31:45.417
- How about that?
- There we go.

31:45.418 --> 31:47.885
- Thinking about the LHC
has been the center

31:47.886 --> 31:53.584
of my intellectual life
for about 15, 16 years now.

31:53.585 --> 31:56.219
Depending on what happens
with the LHC,

31:56.220 --> 31:57.820
you know, these are 15 years

31:57.820 --> 31:59.952
I could come to see
as the best possible thing

31:59.953 --> 32:01.952
I could've been doing
with this time,

32:01.953 --> 32:04.653
or it could just be
that the entire 15 years

32:04.654 --> 32:06.053
might as well have not happened,

32:06.054 --> 32:07.653
had no impact,

32:07.654 --> 32:09.920
and then that's just 15 years
that are gone.

32:09.921 --> 32:11.289
It's not the sort of thing

32:11.488 --> 32:14.254
where there's
a consolation prize.

32:14.255 --> 32:18.788
You know,
it's a fairly binary situation.

32:18.789 --> 32:20.788
I definitely won't feel,
"Oh, well,

32:20.789 --> 32:22.621
"I gave it
a good old college try.

32:22.622 --> 32:23.887
"It's all fine anyway.

32:23.888 --> 32:25.120
It's just trying that counts."

32:25.121 --> 32:26.753
I don't believe that.

32:26.754 --> 32:28.320
I don't believe
it's just trying that counts.

32:28.321 --> 32:29.820
I believe getting it right
is what counts.

32:29.821 --> 32:32.555
Okay, please take your seats.

32:32.556 --> 32:36.321
Now it's time
for the entertainment part.

32:36.322 --> 32:39.753
So as with every
great physics event,

32:39.754 --> 32:42.822
we're going to start
with a big bang,

32:42.822 --> 32:44.821
the ATLAS big bang event,

32:44.823 --> 32:48.221
and that's going to follow
with music all evening,

32:48.222 --> 32:50.823
people from ATLAS, who are
going to be performing for you.

32:50.824 --> 32:53.222
So let's get started.

32:53.223 --> 32:57.721
- Take 2,000 intelligent,
ambitious,

32:57.722 --> 32:59.290
type "A" personalities.

32:59.291 --> 33:02.456
You make them work 16-hour days,

33:02.457 --> 33:06.487
high-pressure situation,
lots of stress.

33:06.488 --> 33:10.056
You know, that's the recipe
for disaster.

33:10.057 --> 33:13.108
Or at least it's a recipe for
a reality television program.

33:14.123 --> 33:15.756
But all that physics,

33:15.757 --> 33:20.255
Higgs, extra dimensions,
supersymmetry,

33:20.256 --> 33:22.889
microscopic black holes,
macroscopic black holes,

33:22.890 --> 33:25.723
Z-primes, you name it,

33:25.724 --> 33:31.057
the physics that the theorists
only dream of

33:31.058 --> 33:32.891
is ours to discover.

33:34.323 --> 33:37.657
Thank you.

34:15.891 --> 34:16.838
♪ Oh, yeah ♪

34:22.791 --> 34:25.091
♪ Thanks to
the Large Hadron Collider ♪

34:25.092 --> 34:27.333
Thank you, ATLAS!

34:36.324 --> 34:39.658
- I grew up in Turkey
from Greek parents

34:39.659 --> 34:43.891
and a middle-class family,

34:43.893 --> 34:48.226
and then, in the '60s,
we became refugees.

34:48.228 --> 34:49.827
We had to leave Turkey

34:49.828 --> 34:52.792
because of ethnic tensions
between Greeks and Turks

34:52.793 --> 34:55.625
over the island of Cyprus,

34:55.626 --> 34:59.159
and there were a lot
of political cross currents,

34:59.160 --> 35:00.758
left, right,

35:00.759 --> 35:03.927
and I was a young,
impressionable 13-year-old

35:03.928 --> 35:06.659
hearing the pro-left
and pro-right arguments,

35:06.660 --> 35:09.560
so one day I would be convinced
that one side was right.

35:09.561 --> 35:10.960
The other day,
I would be convinced

35:10.961 --> 35:12.592
the other side was right.

35:12.593 --> 35:14.127
And then I was getting confused.

35:14.128 --> 35:15.927
How could both of these things
be true

35:15.928 --> 35:18.325
if they were contrary
to each other?

35:18.326 --> 35:22.160
So I decided to focus on a field

35:22.161 --> 35:26.093
where the truth didn't depend
on the eloquence of the speaker.

35:26.094 --> 35:27.929
The truth was absolute.

35:29.927 --> 35:31.993
Of course, when I started out,

35:31.994 --> 35:34.959
I thought that within
maybe five years

35:34.960 --> 35:37.760
the theories
that I was working on

35:37.761 --> 35:39.660
were going to be tested

35:39.661 --> 35:42.961
and I was going to know
the experimental truth

35:42.962 --> 35:46.228
and move on to the next round
of ideas after that.

35:46.229 --> 35:49.126
Little did I know
that the experiments

35:49.127 --> 35:50.762
would take far longer,

35:50.763 --> 35:53.394
and here I am, 30 years after,

35:53.395 --> 35:56.432
still not knowing the truth.

36:01.428 --> 36:03.960
Peter?

36:03.961 --> 36:05.662
- I can show you
here a nice event.

36:05.662 --> 36:07.093
Did you see this from...

36:07.094 --> 36:08.961
- Ah, no.
- Andreas showed me this.

36:08.962 --> 36:10.993
- I haven't seen it.
- This is from yesterday night.

36:10.994 --> 36:13.962
This is now a real
beam gas event.

36:13.963 --> 36:16.495
So you see the tracks
also bent...

36:16.496 --> 36:18.628
- Bent by the field?
- Very nice.

36:18.629 --> 36:19.943
Ah, no, I haven't seen...

36:20.143 --> 36:22.262
In some sense, I started
form the wrong perspective

36:22.263 --> 36:23.929
and in the wrong way,

36:23.930 --> 36:26.296
because I'd been studying
a lot of literature

36:26.298 --> 36:28.895
when I was at high school level.

36:28.896 --> 36:32.295
So literature, art,
philosophy, history,

36:32.296 --> 36:35.262
and very little physics
and mathematics.

36:35.263 --> 36:36.929
I'd also been studying music,
piano,

36:36.930 --> 36:39.297
and so I was very much
attracted by art.

36:41.963 --> 36:45.830
There are many similarities
between music and physics.

36:45.831 --> 36:49.496
Classical music
follows rules of harmony,

36:49.497 --> 36:52.631
which are really rules
of physics and mathematics.

36:55.264 --> 36:58.630
But, also, I was fascinated
by big questions.

36:58.631 --> 37:00.497
That is the possibility
of addressing

37:00.498 --> 37:04.064
and answering big questions
about nature, the universe,

37:04.065 --> 37:06.297
why, when, how,

37:06.298 --> 37:08.463
and when I finished high school,

37:08.464 --> 37:11.796
I thought that physics allow us

37:11.797 --> 37:13.932
to address this big question

37:13.933 --> 37:17.832
in a more practical way
than, for instance, philosophy.

37:17.832 --> 37:20.631
That's why I decided
to study physics.

37:39.232 --> 37:41.433
- Yes, we lost
these two there...

37:52.382 --> 37:54.064
I managed to go through, like,

37:54.065 --> 37:57.011
the four gallons of milk
that I had in the fridge, but...

38:00.052 --> 38:01.998
- We were just waiting
for collisions,

38:01.999 --> 38:03.432
waiting for collisions.

38:03.433 --> 38:06.832
and finally,
then this helium leak,

38:06.833 --> 38:10.899
which really, uh...
it's really frustrating.

38:10.899 --> 38:15.933
We cannot even go there
and investigate what happened.

38:15.934 --> 38:19.098
You have to warm up the magnets,

38:19.099 --> 38:21.667
and warming up the magnets
needs to be done

38:21.668 --> 38:26.165
on a very slow pace and...
in order not to break them...

38:26.166 --> 38:28.743
then you can investigate
and cool them down again.

38:50.267 --> 38:52.401
- The world's largest
atom smasher,

38:52.402 --> 38:55.267
the Large Hadron Collider,

38:55.268 --> 38:57.400
is to be shut down
for at least two months.

38:57.401 --> 38:59.668
CERN, the European Organization
for Nuclear Research...

38:59.669 --> 39:02.333
- Scientists at CERN are trying
to put on a brave face.

39:02.333 --> 39:05.334
A faulty electrical connection
between two magnets

39:05.335 --> 39:06.900
led to a ton of liquid helium

39:06.901 --> 39:09.668
being leaked into
the 27-kilometer tunnel.

39:09.668 --> 39:11.768
The first high-speed
particle collisions

39:11.769 --> 39:13.802
were due to take place
later this month.

39:13.803 --> 39:15.501
The goal now

39:15.502 --> 39:20.786
is simply to get this
vastly complex machine working.

40:08.137 --> 40:09.736
Fucking hell, look at that.

40:09.737 --> 40:11.771
This is just unbelievable.

40:11.772 --> 40:14.937
You've got magnets
just sheared off their jacks.

40:14.938 --> 40:16.725
We've actually
put in enough energy

40:17.003 --> 40:21.135
to melt it and to vaporize
a whole tube of...

40:21.136 --> 40:24.505
- And the stuff's all covered in
a sort of black, metallic dust.

40:24.506 --> 40:25.770
Completely catastrophic, eh?

40:25.771 --> 40:27.436
Completely catastrophic.

40:27.437 --> 40:29.403
- There's no more vacuum
in the beam vacuum,

40:29.404 --> 40:32.270
so can as well open it up and
see whether there's any dust,

40:32.271 --> 40:33.604
because if there's dust,

40:33.605 --> 40:35.736
it means
we have to clean all the way

40:35.737 --> 40:37.169
until it's...

40:37.170 --> 40:38.837
I hope, in the worst case,

40:38.838 --> 40:44.947
we have not to take out
more than 20 or so magnets.

40:53.938 --> 40:58.138
Both my family and my students

40:58.139 --> 41:02.171
detect a definite level of...

41:02.172 --> 41:05.509
let's say pessimism
and disappointment.

41:08.506 --> 41:10.671
The built expectation

41:10.672 --> 41:14.271
that now we were going to know
the truth,

41:14.272 --> 41:16.605
it fizzled and delayed,

41:16.606 --> 41:19.010
and it's just, uh...

41:24.005 --> 41:26.909
I thought
I was stronger than this.

41:28.907 --> 41:31.971
It surprised me.

41:31.972 --> 41:34.172
- I did say that I thought
it was a mistake

41:34.174 --> 41:35.906
for CERN to have
this gigantic celebration

41:35.906 --> 41:38.573
for things just when
it just had a few protons

41:38.574 --> 41:40.973
wandering around in one
direction around the ring,

41:40.974 --> 41:43.407
that it was just a bad idea
to have so much hoopla

41:43.408 --> 41:45.106
before anything
was actually happening.

41:45.108 --> 41:46.606
At the time
when people were asking me

41:46.607 --> 41:48.005
if I was going to CERN
to celebrate,

41:48.006 --> 41:49.572
I said, "I'm going to go to CERN

41:49.574 --> 41:51.439
"when there's a reason
to celebrate, you know,

41:51.440 --> 41:53.238
"when things are colliding
into each other,

41:53.239 --> 41:54.840
"when something
is starting to happen,

41:54.841 --> 41:57.773
not for some crappy PR reason."

41:57.774 --> 41:59.340
And that backfired.

41:59.341 --> 42:01.140
That, I think... really,
that really backfired,

42:01.141 --> 42:03.075
and I think
that was a PR disaster.

42:03.075 --> 42:05.273
It was a PR disaster
largely of CERN's own making.

42:05.274 --> 42:06.974
You don't go around, you know,

42:06.975 --> 42:09.708
having gigantic parties
before anything has happened.

42:36.242 --> 42:39.941
- So the magnets that have
come out are being refurbished,

42:39.942 --> 42:41.808
and so they're sort of
trundling through

42:41.809 --> 42:43.508
about six magnets a week now.

42:43.509 --> 42:46.242
So that's no longer
the bottleneck.

42:46.243 --> 42:48.274
Now they're kind of
getting to the state

42:48.275 --> 42:50.808
where they're ready to start
redoing the interconnects

42:50.809 --> 42:52.642
in the tunnel,

42:52.643 --> 42:56.107
and they're already about a week
or two behind on that.

42:56.108 --> 42:57.608
Given the complexity...

42:57.609 --> 42:59.276
- The other thing
is that they're drilling

42:59.277 --> 43:00.975
these bloody holes
in the magnets.

43:00.976 --> 43:03.508
- Because they, like...
- what I heard this last time,

43:03.509 --> 43:05.741
they were saying that
all their tools are breaking

43:05.742 --> 43:07.175
and that sort of business.

43:07.176 --> 43:08.342
- But it begs the question,
of course,

43:08.343 --> 43:09.941
you know, what are the risks?

43:09.942 --> 43:11.741
I mean, you kind of basically,
you're going...

43:11.742 --> 43:12.976
I don't know.

43:12.977 --> 43:14.509
We didn't actually think so much

43:14.510 --> 43:16.275
about the collateral effects
of the helium.

43:16.276 --> 43:17.510
- Nobody has.
- Yeah, nobody.

43:17.510 --> 43:19.009
- Yeah.
- Nobody.

43:19.010 --> 43:20.742
Well, there's been
a lot of investigations

43:20.743 --> 43:22.342
into the cause
of the original problem,

43:22.344 --> 43:24.308
and the general agreement
is that we run

43:24.309 --> 43:26.642
at half design energy.

43:26.643 --> 43:29.909
- Experimentalists
aren't going to be happy.

43:29.910 --> 43:31.411
Well...

43:31.412 --> 43:34.576
- So, yeah...
so the latest schedule is this:

43:34.577 --> 43:36.611
we just put out is D-Day,

43:36.612 --> 43:38.742
beams back on
the 21st of September.

43:38.743 --> 43:40.975
Isn't that a bit optimistic?

43:40.976 --> 43:43.610
Isn't that a bit
optimistic for, uh, this year?

43:43.611 --> 43:45.610
- When you're dealing
with something

43:45.611 --> 43:47.276
that is a long-term project...

43:47.277 --> 43:49.578
and the LHC
is a long-term project.

43:49.579 --> 43:52.177
It's a 20-year project.

43:52.178 --> 43:54.077
You can't think about the end.

43:54.078 --> 43:55.516
Ever.

43:58.512 --> 44:01.177
If you start out
a marathon thinking,

44:01.178 --> 44:03.077
"I can't wait
to get to the finish line;

44:03.078 --> 44:05.910
"I'm gonna have my Gatorade
at the finish line;

44:05.911 --> 44:09.077
I'm gonna have my greasy french
fries at the finish line,"

44:09.078 --> 44:11.311
or whatever motivates you...

44:11.312 --> 44:13.245
if you start thinking that
at mile one

44:13.246 --> 44:16.078
and it's, like,
ten minutes into the race,

44:16.079 --> 44:17.744
and you're thinking to yourself,

44:17.745 --> 44:20.345
"Wow, I'm only at mile one.

44:20.346 --> 44:26.079
I've got 25.2 miles to go."

44:26.080 --> 44:28.344
And if you're thinking that
at the start,

44:28.345 --> 44:29.612
then you're done.

44:29.613 --> 44:30.946
Mentally, you are done.

44:32.479 --> 44:34.793
- This is what doing
discovery physics means.

44:35.779 --> 44:37.746
This is what doing
discovery means.

44:59.314 --> 45:01.979
Why do people have curiosity?

45:01.980 --> 45:06.414
Why do we care about how
distant parts of the universe,

45:06.415 --> 45:08.512
things that happened
billion years ago,

45:08.513 --> 45:09.980
like the big bang,

45:09.981 --> 45:11.581
why do we find them
that interesting?

45:11.582 --> 45:14.279
It doesn't affect
what we do day-to-day.

45:14.280 --> 45:17.947
But nevertheless,
once you have curiosity,

45:17.948 --> 45:19.913
you can't control it.

45:23.814 --> 45:26.014
- It'll ask questions
about the universe.

45:26.015 --> 45:29.746
It will ask questions
about harmonic patterns

45:29.747 --> 45:34.447
that create art, music.

45:34.448 --> 45:36.415
- That's a sculpture?
- That's a sculpture.

45:36.415 --> 45:38.482
- Yeah, doesn't it look like
a bunch of broken tiles?

45:38.483 --> 45:40.146
- That's what it's supposed
to look like.

45:40.147 --> 45:41.980
And it's, uh...
and when I saw it,

45:41.982 --> 45:44.282
I thought it was just rubble
left over from the construction.

45:44.283 --> 45:45.515
Right, yeah.

45:45.516 --> 45:46.848
- You can, in principle,
move it.

45:46.849 --> 45:48.448
- So people go up
and move pieces?

45:48.449 --> 45:51.447
- No, people don't.
- But people could.

45:51.448 --> 45:53.248
Why would they have it
so you can move it around

45:53.249 --> 45:54.781
if you weren't going
to move it around?

45:54.782 --> 45:56.248
No, I think you're right.

45:56.248 --> 45:57.913
- I think you're allowed
to move it around.

45:57.914 --> 45:59.814
- It's certainly
a different experience of it.

45:59.815 --> 46:01.180
I agree.

46:01.182 --> 46:03.114
See, I thought
that that belonged here.

46:03.115 --> 46:04.483
It's just...
it's the perfect spot.

46:04.484 --> 46:05.915
- It certainly
changes everything.

46:05.916 --> 46:08.515
- It does.
- Slate and granite.

46:08.516 --> 46:11.647
I guess that's the granite,
and that's the slate.

46:11.648 --> 46:13.419
Hmm.

46:16.417 --> 46:19.015
It's interesting.

46:19.016 --> 46:20.683
- There's something
philosophically

46:20.684 --> 46:23.349
about this piece of art
that bothers me.

46:23.350 --> 46:25.682
It's taking a lot of
sort of random things

46:25.683 --> 46:26.982
and making some order out of it.

46:26.983 --> 46:28.515
Yes.

46:28.516 --> 46:30.282
- It's trying to make order
out of something

46:30.283 --> 46:31.816
where there isn't any,

46:31.817 --> 46:33.849
instead of taking things
that don't seem ordered

46:33.850 --> 46:36.615
and figuring out
that there is order.

46:36.616 --> 46:40.251
- The way we try to reduce
the complexity of the world

46:40.252 --> 46:43.748
is by looking for patterns,

46:43.749 --> 46:46.016
what we call symmetries.

46:46.017 --> 46:49.316
We take all the particles
we know today,

46:49.317 --> 46:50.749
and we attempt to fit them

46:50.750 --> 46:52.748
into some kind
of underlying structure.

46:53.651 --> 46:57.085
Are they the remnants
of some more beautiful

46:57.086 --> 47:01.286
and complete picture
of the laws of nature?

47:03.284 --> 47:07.951
It's like, you go to Egypt,
and you see ruins.

47:07.952 --> 47:10.484
If you look at it the right way,

47:10.485 --> 47:11.641
I could draw a pyramid

47:12.618 --> 47:14.650
and see that
these chunks of stone

47:14.651 --> 47:17.983
are actually the remains
of something very clean

47:17.985 --> 47:19.483
and very symmetric,

47:19.484 --> 47:22.417
very beautiful.

47:22.418 --> 47:25.753
We know that the Standard Model
is incomplete.

47:27.751 --> 47:29.984
We know that there's
other stuff out there,

47:29.985 --> 47:33.185
that there are other particles
that we haven't seen yet.

47:33.186 --> 47:36.285
Dark matter
is a speculated particle

47:36.286 --> 47:39.917
which we think
actually dominates the universe,

47:39.918 --> 47:42.418
and yet we've never seen it
directly,

47:42.419 --> 47:45.118
and it's not part
of the Standard Model.

47:45.119 --> 47:47.851
That's one of those rocks.

47:47.852 --> 47:50.519
We think, possibly,

47:50.520 --> 47:54.185
that that and many other
particles are still out there

47:54.186 --> 47:56.588
and are all part
of a much bigger symmetry,

47:57.587 --> 47:59.252
a much bigger theory

47:59.253 --> 48:02.124
that includes the Standard
Model, but much more.

48:08.118 --> 48:11.953
The most popular theory
is called supersymmetry,

48:11.954 --> 48:14.119
or SUSY for short.

48:14.120 --> 48:18.320
Supersymmetry was a theory
that sort of started to develop

48:18.321 --> 48:19.785
in the late '70s.

48:19.786 --> 48:22.352
Savas was one
of the first authors

48:22.353 --> 48:26.620
of the first theories
of supersymmetry.

48:26.621 --> 48:29.821
- It is the unfathomable
depths of...

48:29.822 --> 48:35.688
- Supersymmetry is our best
guess of what else is out there,

48:35.689 --> 48:37.787
the bigger theory
that incorporates

48:37.788 --> 48:39.354
our current theories,

48:39.355 --> 48:41.653
the Standard Model.

48:41.654 --> 48:43.786
But for it to be true,

48:43.787 --> 48:47.364
we have to discover
those other particles.

48:57.351 --> 48:59.454
- If I could choose a dream
of any theory

48:59.455 --> 49:01.187
that the LHC could find,

49:01.188 --> 49:03.821
actually, I would love
for them to see supersymmetry.

49:03.822 --> 49:09.755
Supersymmetry says,
for every type of particle,

49:09.756 --> 49:11.287
say the electron,

49:11.289 --> 49:13.955
there's a heavy superpartner.

49:13.956 --> 49:15.653
So you have the...

49:15.654 --> 49:17.622
and they have really stupid
names, unfortunately,

49:17.623 --> 49:19.154
called the selectron.

49:19.155 --> 49:21.354
You just add an S to the name.
The squark.

49:21.355 --> 49:25.422
Uh, the sup, the sdown.

49:25.422 --> 49:27.255
Supersymmetry, or SUSY,

49:27.257 --> 49:30.522
is extremely important
for the theoretical community

49:30.523 --> 49:33.156
because it solves
many mathematical problems

49:33.157 --> 49:35.088
with the Standard model.

49:35.089 --> 49:38.822
Now, experimentally, it would be
the experimentalists' dream.

49:38.823 --> 49:42.022
You know, tons of particles
that are just coming out,

49:42.023 --> 49:43.855
and you just don't even know
what to do with...

49:43.856 --> 49:45.689
you know, can't even
write the data fast enough

49:45.690 --> 49:47.022
in order to discover them.

49:47.023 --> 49:50.293
So that'd be my dream.

49:53.095 --> 49:55.356
It used to be
that in the control room life,

49:55.357 --> 49:56.656
it was kind of a luxury.

49:56.657 --> 49:58.488
You know, you could kind of...

49:58.489 --> 50:00.521
you could, you know, kind
of style your hair for the day

50:00.523 --> 50:02.655
because you didn't have to wear
a hard helmet all day.

50:02.656 --> 50:04.357
You could wear nice shoes,
you know,

50:04.358 --> 50:06.425
because you were in
the control room environment.

50:06.426 --> 50:09.090
Now, it's all back to, you know,

50:09.091 --> 50:11.257
bring the dirtiest clothes
that you own to work

50:11.458 --> 50:13.756
because you're gonna be crawling
around in, like,

50:13.757 --> 50:15.457
you know, hard helmets,
steel-toed boots.

50:15.458 --> 50:16.823
Not the most attractive shoes,

50:16.824 --> 50:18.611
but, you know,
I kind of like them.

50:21.258 --> 50:23.091
We're pulling out
the electronics.

50:23.092 --> 50:25.190
We're fixing things that
we didn't actually have time

50:25.191 --> 50:28.358
to get to
during the last shutdown.

50:28.358 --> 50:30.456
The goal of this is
that it would be

50:30.457 --> 50:33.828
in even better shape
for next beam.

50:36.824 --> 50:43.325
Okay, so that is, I think,
all that I have to say.

50:43.326 --> 50:47.091
Hope the theorists
aren't driving you crazy.

50:47.092 --> 50:49.424
Don't listen to them,
by the way,

50:49.425 --> 50:51.357
because theorists,

50:51.358 --> 50:55.259
they can sometimes...

50:56.259 --> 50:57.858
Just telling you.

50:57.859 --> 50:59.624
You got to come back
to the experimental world

50:59.625 --> 51:03.759
so that you can touch bases
with reality.

51:03.760 --> 51:06.793
All right,
I'll talk to you soon.

51:11.020 --> 51:13.492
- One of the most basic facts
about the universe

51:13.493 --> 51:14.693
is that it's big.

51:14.694 --> 51:17.191
So you might wonder,

51:17.192 --> 51:21.025
"Why is the universe big?"

51:21.026 --> 51:23.092
There's actually
a single number,

51:23.093 --> 51:24.692
called
the cosmological constant,

51:24.693 --> 51:26.760
that plays a crucial role

51:26.761 --> 51:29.325
in determining
what the universe looks like.

51:29.326 --> 51:32.093
In fact, around ten years ago,

51:32.094 --> 51:34.925
astronomers discovered
a really remarkable fact:

51:34.926 --> 51:37.826
the universe is getting bigger
and bigger

51:37.827 --> 51:40.262
at a faster and faster rate.

51:42.260 --> 51:45.660
But this rate
is a million, billion,

51:45.661 --> 51:50.292
billion, billion, billion,
billion, billion times slower

51:50.293 --> 51:52.529
than what we'd actually predict.

51:54.127 --> 51:56.695
When you're off by
a factor of a million, billion,

51:56.696 --> 51:58.861
billion, billion, billion,
billion, billion,

51:58.863 --> 52:00.528
there's something very wrong

52:00.529 --> 52:04.794
with your understanding
of basic physics.

52:04.795 --> 52:06.260
Even worse,

52:06.261 --> 52:08.294
this one number,
the cosmological constant,

52:08.295 --> 52:10.626
needs to have
this extremely precise value.

52:10.627 --> 52:13.760
And if the value
is different even by a tiny bit,

52:13.760 --> 52:17.197
we would radically change what
the world looks like around us.

52:20.194 --> 52:22.428
If you saw a situation where,

52:22.429 --> 52:24.794
if the parameter
has a very dangerous value

52:24.795 --> 52:26.828
and you change it a little bit,

52:26.829 --> 52:28.194
the world
would change radically,

52:28.195 --> 52:29.460
and we'd be dead.

52:29.461 --> 52:31.328
We couldn't possibly live.

52:31.328 --> 52:33.160
You would wonder
where that came from.

52:33.161 --> 52:35.661
You know, how is that possible?

52:35.662 --> 52:37.262
So just on the face of it,

52:37.264 --> 52:39.096
you would look at the situation
and say,

52:39.097 --> 52:42.328
"Wow, someone really cared
to put this parameter

52:42.329 --> 52:44.828
"at just the right value
so that we get to be here

52:44.829 --> 52:46.963
"and that
it's a pleasant universe

52:46.964 --> 52:50.197
and really cares a lot."

52:52.195 --> 52:55.366
This is the sort of thing that
really keeps you up at night.

52:56.964 --> 52:59.529
It really makes you wonder,
"Maybe we've got something

52:59.530 --> 53:01.696
"about the whole picture,
the big picture,

53:01.697 --> 53:03.381
totally, totally,
totally wrong."

53:19.264 --> 53:21.963
- Before I went
to elementary school,

53:21.964 --> 53:27.128
my mother started telling me
biblical stories.

53:27.129 --> 53:29.364
She told me that if we are good,

53:29.365 --> 53:31.029
we'll go to paradise,

53:31.030 --> 53:33.534
and we will stay there forever.

53:35.531 --> 53:38.262
And when she said "forever,"

53:38.263 --> 53:41.697
I started panicking.

53:41.698 --> 53:43.196
I kept asking, "Forever?"

53:43.197 --> 53:44.462
"Forever?"

53:44.463 --> 53:46.163
You mean, it never ends?

53:46.164 --> 53:48.798
Like, you wake up,
and you know that then,

53:48.799 --> 53:50.129
you go back to sleep,

53:50.130 --> 53:52.364
and this never ends, never ends,

53:52.365 --> 53:53.836
never ends.

53:57.832 --> 53:59.831
I started crying.

53:59.832 --> 54:01.498
She told me,
"What's wrong with you?

54:01.499 --> 54:02.764
"This is paradise.

54:02.765 --> 54:05.130
"It will be a lot of fun.

54:05.131 --> 54:06.707
You'll be very happy there."

54:15.699 --> 54:18.864
But this idea of eternity,

54:18.865 --> 54:21.699
something infinite,

54:21.700 --> 54:23.998
scared me.

54:47.534 --> 54:49.433
- There is
a scientific alternative

54:49.434 --> 54:51.833
to believing there's
someone out there who loves us,

54:51.834 --> 54:55.499
twiddling the dials very finely
for things to work out.

54:55.500 --> 54:57.932
And this alternative,
said briefly,

54:57.933 --> 55:00.367
is that everything we see
in our observed universe

55:00.368 --> 55:02.532
is actually a very small part

55:02.533 --> 55:06.666
of a much,
much vaster multiverse.

55:06.667 --> 55:08.434
You might
literally imagine that,

55:08.435 --> 55:10.199
from some bird's eye
point of view,

55:10.200 --> 55:13.033
if you went
to enormous distances,

55:13.034 --> 55:15.667
you would see that our universe
is actually a little pocket

55:15.668 --> 55:19.104
inside a vastly bigger space.

55:22.102 --> 55:24.868
In this picture,
these mysterious numbers,

55:24.869 --> 55:26.600
like the cosmological constant,

55:26.601 --> 55:29.837
are actually basically random.

55:31.835 --> 55:35.433
And out there in the multiverse,
next to us somewhere,

55:35.434 --> 55:38.434
is another region
where these numbers take on

55:38.436 --> 55:39.666
some other random value,

55:39.667 --> 55:41.334
and then another region

55:41.335 --> 55:43.535
where they take on
some other random value still.

55:43.536 --> 55:46.268
Only in a tiny sliver,
a minuscule part

55:46.269 --> 55:47.969
of this gigantic multiverse,

55:47.970 --> 55:50.367
for completely
accidental reasons,

55:50.368 --> 55:53.134
do these numbers take on
the very, very special values

55:53.135 --> 55:54.833
which allows structures to grow,

55:54.834 --> 55:58.435
stars to form, galaxies to form.

55:58.436 --> 56:00.307
Ultimately,
things like us to form.

56:03.303 --> 56:07.134
This is the really
opposite extreme interpretation

56:07.135 --> 56:09.269
of the presence of fine-tuning

56:09.270 --> 56:12.703
as intelligent designers
would want to give.

56:12.704 --> 56:15.134
If you believe
that someone out there cares

56:15.135 --> 56:18.001
and twiddles the parameters
so that you can exist,

56:18.002 --> 56:21.604
that puts our existence
at the very core of reality.

56:21.604 --> 56:24.469
If you believe
that our entire universe

56:24.470 --> 56:27.036
is a tiny, little,
minuscule spec

56:27.036 --> 56:30.003
in a gigantic multiverse
which is mostly lethal,

56:30.004 --> 56:32.169
that's a polar opposite
philosophy

56:32.170 --> 56:35.870
for what the universe
looks like.

56:35.871 --> 56:39.336
In fact, it's an idea
that many physicists loathe,

56:39.337 --> 56:41.669
because certain questions
then become things

56:41.670 --> 56:45.040
that we will not hope
to be able to understand.

56:47.038 --> 56:50.836
- Nima is now an advocate
for this idea

56:50.837 --> 56:53.104
that the laws of physics
are different

56:53.105 --> 56:56.170
in different parts
of this multiverse,

56:56.171 --> 56:59.171
that what we measure
in experiments

56:59.172 --> 57:02.671
are not deep mysteries
of nature,

57:02.672 --> 57:06.004
but they're just random
accidents in our universe,

57:06.005 --> 57:08.270
that maybe even the Higgs itself

57:08.271 --> 57:11.302
is a random accident that
has occurred in our universe

57:11.304 --> 57:14.871
and let's life exist,
but has no explanation.

57:17.937 --> 57:20.809
In a sense,
it's the end of physics.

57:23.805 --> 57:26.203
- On the one hand,
we have the direction

57:26.204 --> 57:28.638
that we've been on
for the last 400 years,

57:28.639 --> 57:33.770
towards increasing beauty,
simplicity, symmetry,

57:33.771 --> 57:36.339
and a path
that has time and time again

57:36.340 --> 57:38.605
paid off with deeper
and deeper insights

57:38.606 --> 57:40.279
about the way the world works.

57:46.271 --> 57:50.271
On the other hand, we have
the idea of the multiverse,

57:50.273 --> 57:53.272
which would move us
to a real picture

57:53.273 --> 57:56.506
not of symmetry and beauty
and order,

57:56.507 --> 58:01.510
but fundamentally of chaos
on enormous distances.

58:04.506 --> 58:08.440
This is the really
very, very big-scale question

58:08.441 --> 58:10.281
which the LHC
is going to push us in

58:10.974 --> 58:13.822
one way or the other.

58:33.972 --> 58:35.708
- What happens, for example,
if...

58:35.710 --> 58:36.975
Oh, blimey.

58:36.976 --> 58:38.607
Yeah, there's a lot of...

58:38.608 --> 58:40.813
Hi, Katja.
You all right?

58:47.508 --> 58:49.508
Oh, you're not recording this,
huh?

58:49.509 --> 58:50.876
Yes, we're all on the...

59:00.207 --> 59:02.521
- Yeah, don't worry
about all the other crap.

59:06.008 --> 59:08.442
We've got the beams
going around again.

59:08.443 --> 59:10.141
The magnet repairs
are holding up well,

59:10.142 --> 59:12.108
and our next challenge
is to take these beams

59:12.109 --> 59:13.475
up to high energy
and collide them.

59:13.476 --> 59:14.976
Okay.

59:14.977 --> 59:17.942
- We're very, very aware
of the damage we can do.

59:17.943 --> 59:19.608
Here we go.

59:19.609 --> 59:22.986
- That's what worries me stiff
at the moment.

59:32.977 --> 59:38.543
- The original proposal
for ATLAS was in 1989.

59:38.544 --> 59:40.543
And you're kind of riding
this idea.

59:40.544 --> 59:43.209
You've got this dream
of physics.

59:43.210 --> 59:45.276
This dream of physics
is what pulled everyone along

59:45.277 --> 59:46.277
for those 19 years.

59:46.877 --> 59:50.376
And so here, now, today,
finally,

59:50.377 --> 59:52.843
with high-energy collisions,

59:52.844 --> 59:57.977
we can start to look
for that dream of new physics.

59:57.978 --> 59:58.878
Uh, blue.

59:59.877 --> 01:00:02.774
The control room, yes.

01:00:02.775 --> 01:00:04.043
The control room.

01:00:04.044 --> 01:00:05.451
This is the control room.

01:00:12.444 --> 01:00:16.810
- The pressure of it being
an event, of course, is there.

01:00:16.811 --> 01:00:20.510
And, of course, anything
can go wrong, and it has.

01:00:20.511 --> 01:00:23.544
Last weekend
was a complete disaster.

01:00:23.545 --> 01:00:24.977
We were discussing
the possibility

01:00:24.978 --> 01:00:27.310
that we do collisions
during the night

01:00:27.311 --> 01:00:30.111
rather than the plan,
9:00 in the morning.

01:00:30.112 --> 01:00:33.043
Of course,
this has caused major,

01:00:33.044 --> 01:00:35.611
sort of knock-ons for,
one, the experiments,

01:00:35.612 --> 01:00:38.701
and two, for the media service.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.112
Good morning, everybody.

01:01:03.113 --> 01:01:04.645
I propose we start.

01:01:04.646 --> 01:01:06.380
I will take you briefly
over the whole summary

01:01:06.381 --> 01:01:07.845
of the weekend,

01:01:07.845 --> 01:01:09.945
just to get you
up to date what happened.

01:01:09.946 --> 01:01:11.712
During the night,
we tried to set up again

01:01:11.713 --> 01:01:12.979
for high intensities,

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:14.512
for 450 GeV collisions,

01:01:14.513 --> 01:01:15.980
but then we were cut short

01:01:15.981 --> 01:01:18.144
because we encountered a vacuum.

01:01:18.145 --> 01:01:21.880
- What everybody wants,
from a physics point of view

01:01:21.881 --> 01:01:23.179
and from being sure,

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.179
is doing it secretly before

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:27.212
and showing it to the media
during the day.

01:01:27.213 --> 01:01:29.345
And I think this was also
the wish of Fabiola.

01:01:29.346 --> 01:01:31.312
It's the wish of everybody,

01:01:31.313 --> 01:01:33.613
because this is, of course,
then you're much more certain.

01:01:33.614 --> 01:01:36.311
But this does not work nowadays.

01:01:36.313 --> 01:01:37.946
Media wants to see
this little risk.

01:01:37.947 --> 01:01:39.446
I understand.

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:41.881
So that means
we have to adapt to that.

01:01:41.882 --> 01:01:42.782
Let's see.

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:47.313
This...
this is not it.

01:01:47.314 --> 01:01:48.681
It doesn't seem like...

01:01:48.681 --> 01:01:50.180
You got to hit the reload.

01:01:50.181 --> 01:01:52.613
I'm reloading it.

01:01:52.614 --> 01:01:55.478
Yeah, I wonder
if we should stop.

01:01:55.479 --> 01:01:57.281
Everyone is reloading it.

01:01:57.281 --> 01:01:59.017
Maybe we should stop.

01:02:01.015 --> 01:02:02.281
There you go.

01:02:02.282 --> 01:02:04.381
- Hey!
- All right.

01:02:04.382 --> 01:02:06.483
Okay, now.

01:02:08.481 --> 01:02:10.347
And, indeed, welcome to CERN,

01:02:10.348 --> 01:02:12.347
the European Organization
for Nuclear Research,

01:02:12.348 --> 01:02:13.646
in Geneva.

01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:15.449
Welcome to
the CERN control center.

01:02:43.483 --> 01:02:45.015
And here on the screen

01:02:45.016 --> 01:02:47.114
we can see the four
different experiments:

01:02:47.115 --> 01:02:51.481
ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, and ALICE.

01:02:51.482 --> 01:02:55.683
And the program for today
is to first send one beam

01:02:55.684 --> 01:02:58.550
in one direction, a second
beam in the opposite direction.

01:02:58.551 --> 01:03:01.449
They will circulate
in parallel for a while,

01:03:01.450 --> 01:03:04.481
and when everything is ready
and under control,

01:03:04.482 --> 01:03:06.183
the separation
is going to be removed,

01:03:06.184 --> 01:03:09.350
and the beams
are going to be made to collide

01:03:09.351 --> 01:03:12.115
in the four points
around the LHC machine.

01:03:12.116 --> 01:03:14.115
- I just think to myself,
if you imagine, like,

01:03:14.116 --> 01:03:16.182
Thomas Edison, like,
inventing the lightbulb...

01:03:16.183 --> 01:03:18.317
if he had tried to invent
the lightbulb with, like,

01:03:18.318 --> 01:03:20.182
a hundred camera crews
in his workshop,

01:03:20.183 --> 01:03:21.849
and they would've been like,
"Oh, my God,

01:03:21.850 --> 01:03:23.148
"you can't even turn it on?

01:03:23.149 --> 01:03:24.516
"Come on!
Turn it on now!

01:03:24.517 --> 01:03:26.350
"Come... ugh,
we're still waiting?

01:03:26.351 --> 01:03:28.449
Come on. Ah, come on.
What's wrong with this guy?"

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:34.350
- So the violet... there's always
one vertical, horizontal beam.

01:03:34.351 --> 01:03:35.785
One beam.

01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:40.518
Shh!

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:43.149
Please.

01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:44.950
So a few minutes.

01:03:44.951 --> 01:03:45.793
Okay, thank you.

01:03:46.652 --> 01:03:48.222
Thank you, bye.

01:03:53.219 --> 01:03:54.484
Wow.

01:03:54.485 --> 01:03:56.024
Everybody hear?

01:04:02.017 --> 01:04:05.351
Few minutes away.

01:04:05.353 --> 01:04:08.851
- So we should watch that one,
our trigger rate,

01:04:08.852 --> 01:04:11.385
this one, the separation bumps,
and the event displays.

01:04:11.386 --> 01:04:13.152
Okay, these are
the three screens to watch.

01:04:13.153 --> 01:04:14.885
If you have three eyes,
one there, one here,

01:04:14.886 --> 01:04:18.118
and one over there.

01:04:18.119 --> 01:04:20.886
- So, okay,
both beams are at 3.5 TeV,

01:04:20.887 --> 01:04:23.784
and we've just collapsed
the separation bumps

01:04:23.785 --> 01:04:25.385
and brought the beams
into collision

01:04:25.386 --> 01:04:26.718
inside the four experiments.

01:04:26.719 --> 01:04:28.020
- Starting.
- They're starting.

01:04:28.021 --> 01:04:29.652
They're starting.

01:04:29.653 --> 01:04:32.319
- Oh.
- Ooh.

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:35.951
Okay, they're starting.

01:04:35.952 --> 01:04:38.285
- Two beams,
one in blue, one in red,

01:04:38.286 --> 01:04:42.153
each circulating
in opposite directions.

01:04:42.154 --> 01:04:44.685
They have
to get closer and closer.

01:04:44.686 --> 01:04:48.520
When the numbers
on the four readers say zero,

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:51.655
it means that the beams
are finally aligned.

01:05:12.021 --> 01:05:14.703
This is the historical moment
we were all expecting.

01:05:15.555 --> 01:05:18.191
It can be anytime now.

01:06:19.156 --> 01:06:22.155
Wow! Wow!

01:06:22.156 --> 01:06:23.390
Fantastic!

01:06:23.391 --> 01:06:25.356
Beautiful.

01:06:25.357 --> 01:06:28.625
- Wow.
- We are ready.

01:06:38.625 --> 01:06:39.890
First things first.

01:06:39.891 --> 01:06:43.457
I just have to say:
"data."

01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:48.625
It's... it's unbelievable
how fantastic data is.

01:07:07.797 --> 01:07:09.323
You have this invariant mass.

01:07:09.324 --> 01:07:11.124
This is for the Z
to mu-mu channel.

01:07:11.125 --> 01:07:12.891
And you have this mass peak
of the Z,

01:07:12.893 --> 01:07:14.868
in order to estimate
your backgrounds.

01:07:23.859 --> 01:07:28.724
It's like the world
at ATLAS and LHC and CMS

01:07:28.725 --> 01:07:30.557
and all those places
has suddenly changed.

01:07:30.558 --> 01:07:33.025
I mean, it's like,
all of a sudden, there's data.

01:07:33.026 --> 01:07:34.959
And after so many years
of not having data

01:07:34.959 --> 01:07:36.324
and new data, new physics,

01:07:36.325 --> 01:07:37.958
there's just so much
possibility,

01:07:37.959 --> 01:07:39.558
and even though
you're rediscovering

01:07:39.559 --> 01:07:41.490
the Standard Model,
that is more exciting.

01:07:41.491 --> 01:07:43.691
But the most exciting thing
about the data

01:07:43.693 --> 01:07:45.557
is not the first collision.

01:07:45.558 --> 01:07:47.291
Because the first collision,
okay, great.

01:07:47.292 --> 01:07:49.857
First collision,
everyone loves the first.

01:07:49.858 --> 01:07:52.826
But the most exciting thing
about the data is the, you know,

01:07:52.827 --> 01:07:54.860
1 millionth collision
or the 2 millionth collision

01:07:54.861 --> 01:07:57.026
or the fact that collisions
just keep coming and coming

01:07:57.027 --> 01:07:58.560
and coming and coming,

01:07:58.561 --> 01:08:00.560
and the more and more
collisions we have,

01:08:00.561 --> 01:08:02.192
the more and more chance we have

01:08:02.193 --> 01:08:04.024
to look
at the interesting physics,

01:08:04.025 --> 01:08:07.193
because it just means more
and more and more data for us.

01:08:07.194 --> 01:08:08.626
The running is pretty good.

01:08:08.627 --> 01:08:10.658
- But right now,
it's running amazingly.

01:08:10.659 --> 01:08:12.193
Yeah, right now,

01:08:12.194 --> 01:08:13.992
but the day of reckoning
is in several months.

01:08:13.993 --> 01:08:15.494
We heard rumors on that.

01:08:15.495 --> 01:08:17.060
- Well, we should be hearing
rumors now.

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.693
We really should be
hearing rumors now.

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:20.027
- I'm a little worried,
actually.

01:08:20.028 --> 01:08:21.727
Yeah.

01:08:21.728 --> 01:08:23.661
- Well, we're hearing murmurs.
- What, what's...

01:08:23.662 --> 01:08:25.060
Murmurs.
We're hearing murmurs.

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:26.826
There either...
there isn't much there,

01:08:26.827 --> 01:08:28.894
or they're doing a very good job
keeping a poker face.

01:08:28.895 --> 01:08:30.727
- Or they're still at the point
where half of...

01:08:30.728 --> 01:08:32.361
where they're still trying
to figure out

01:08:32.362 --> 01:08:34.225
what's a murmur
and what's a rumor, internally.

01:08:34.227 --> 01:08:36.060
And I think
that's probably actually true.

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:37.328
Right.

01:08:37.328 --> 01:08:38.626
The problem is that, also,

01:08:38.627 --> 01:08:40.326
I take completely innocent
remarks

01:08:40.327 --> 01:08:42.158
and vastly over-interpret them.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.526
- Obviously, we're going to
learn about the first discovery

01:08:44.528 --> 01:08:46.127
on Twitter and Facebook.

01:08:46.127 --> 01:08:47.627
- That's so sad,
but I think it's true.

01:08:47.627 --> 01:08:49.126
It is.

01:08:49.127 --> 01:08:50.960
- You mean, I shouldn't check
the arXiv

01:08:50.961 --> 01:08:53.161
first thing in the morning...
I need to check my Facebook?

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:55.294
- The arXiv is the last thing.
- The arXiv is the last...

01:08:55.295 --> 01:08:56.995
- First, like,
check Nima's Twitter feed.

01:08:56.995 --> 01:08:58.327
Then check the arXiv.

01:08:58.328 --> 01:09:00.060
If Nima has a Twitter feed,

01:09:00.062 --> 01:09:02.270
then there's something
has been discovered.

01:09:03.895 --> 01:09:08.794
It is August 7, 2011,

01:09:08.795 --> 01:09:14.895
and, this is a significant time
for the LHC.

01:09:14.895 --> 01:09:17.161
The first big set of data

01:09:17.162 --> 01:09:21.461
was presented
at the end of July.

01:09:21.462 --> 01:09:25.828
The data
has little extra bits in it

01:09:25.830 --> 01:09:29.229
which could be interpreted
as a Higgs.

01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:32.495
Even though the LHC
is running at half power,

01:09:32.495 --> 01:09:35.662
it actually has gotten data
much, much faster

01:09:35.662 --> 01:09:37.529
than anybody expected.

01:09:37.529 --> 01:09:41.895
And that allowed them to be
sensitive to the Higgs boson.

01:09:41.897 --> 01:09:43.728
It's fucking cool right now.

01:09:43.729 --> 01:09:45.627
There was huge excitement

01:09:45.629 --> 01:09:48.462
because the Higgs' results
of the two main detectors,

01:09:48.462 --> 01:09:50.363
CMS and ATLAS, were first shown,

01:09:50.363 --> 01:09:52.696
together, in the same meeting.

01:09:52.697 --> 01:09:54.530
For me, as Run Coordinator,

01:09:54.531 --> 01:09:56.099
I discussed every little problem

01:09:56.299 --> 01:09:58.030
where we lost here
a little bit of data

01:09:58.031 --> 01:09:59.663
and there a little bit of data,

01:09:59.664 --> 01:10:03.862
so somehow I really feel
attached to this data set.

01:10:03.863 --> 01:10:07.698
So somehow it makes me proud
if the Higgs is found

01:10:07.699 --> 01:10:09.299
or not with this data set.

01:10:10.299 --> 01:10:12.696
- The three, two, ones,
so the effect...

01:10:12.697 --> 01:10:16.163
- The mass of the Higgs,
namely the weight of the Higgs,

01:10:16.164 --> 01:10:18.730
can actually tell us
or give us a hint

01:10:18.731 --> 01:10:20.064
about what comes next.

01:10:20.065 --> 01:10:25.331
If the mass
is on the lighter side,

01:10:25.332 --> 01:10:28.632
then that's consistent
with some of the standard things

01:10:28.632 --> 01:10:30.031
we've been looking for.

01:10:30.033 --> 01:10:33.364
Supersymmetry generally favors

01:10:33.365 --> 01:10:35.464
that the Higgs
is as light as possible.

01:10:35.465 --> 01:10:38.498
About 115 times
the mass of the proton.

01:10:38.499 --> 01:10:40.664
It's 115 GeV:

01:10:40.665 --> 01:10:42.633
Giga electron volts.

01:10:42.634 --> 01:10:47.030
If, on the other hand,
the Higgs is 140 GeV,

01:10:47.031 --> 01:10:49.697
140 times the mass
of the proton,

01:10:49.698 --> 01:10:50.803
it's a terrible mass,

01:10:51.232 --> 01:10:55.798
because 140 GeV
is associated with theories

01:10:55.799 --> 01:10:58.164
that rely on the multiverse.

01:10:58.165 --> 01:11:00.997
ATLAS has a little bump here,

01:11:00.998 --> 01:11:04.132
a small excess visible near 140.

01:11:04.133 --> 01:11:06.166
And now, holy crap.

01:11:06.167 --> 01:11:08.031
It's 140!

01:11:08.032 --> 01:11:11.131
It's starting to look like
nature has made its choice.

01:11:11.132 --> 01:11:13.365
- What do we learn
if the LHC does discover

01:11:13.366 --> 01:11:15.465
a Higgs at 140 and nothing else?

01:11:15.467 --> 01:11:17.731
Chaos. Okay?

01:11:17.732 --> 01:11:19.364
- The problem
with the multiverse

01:11:19.366 --> 01:11:20.833
is that it says the Higgs

01:11:20.834 --> 01:11:23.201
might be the last particle
we ever see.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.332
- So what we should do...
- I think the Higgs mass issue...

01:11:27.333 --> 01:11:30.301
- If we don't see any new
particles besides the Higgs,

01:11:30.301 --> 01:11:33.131
we don't get any explanation
for dark matter.

01:11:33.132 --> 01:11:36.534
We don't know
how the Higgs itself got a mass.

01:11:36.535 --> 01:11:41.000
We never get access
to the deeper theory.

01:11:41.001 --> 01:11:42.868
All that information

01:11:42.869 --> 01:11:46.004
could be in the other universes.

01:11:48.002 --> 01:11:51.699
We may be at the end
of the road.

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:54.069
That's it.

01:11:56.067 --> 01:12:00.570
I guess, um...

01:12:01.569 --> 01:12:05.734
Well, if it's right
at that number,

01:12:05.735 --> 01:12:07.733
then it would be
so fucking astounding.

01:12:08.167 --> 01:12:10.200
Where the F is SUSY, right?

01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:11.667
I mean, there's nothing.

01:12:11.668 --> 01:12:13.066
I mean,
where's all the other stuff?

01:12:13.067 --> 01:12:14.467
Where are the other particles?

01:12:14.468 --> 01:12:16.301
What happened to dark matter?
I mean...

01:12:16.301 --> 01:12:18.134
- I've heard of many theories
saying that new particles

01:12:18.135 --> 01:12:19.400
might be
at even higher energies, so...

01:12:19.401 --> 01:12:21.069
Right.

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:23.302
- Who knows? I mean,
it always comes differently.

01:12:23.303 --> 01:12:24.968
Who knows if there
are other interesting things.

01:12:24.969 --> 01:12:26.501
You know, somehow
it always comes differently

01:12:26.502 --> 01:12:28.167
than you expect.

01:12:28.168 --> 01:12:30.669
- I know that the theorists
are all up in arms,

01:12:30.670 --> 01:12:32.401
because, you know,
it could be a heavy Higgs,

01:12:32.402 --> 01:12:33.966
but, you know,
I've always said, like,

01:12:33.967 --> 01:12:35.336
the worst-case scenario,

01:12:35.337 --> 01:12:37.502
I think,
would be Higgs and Higgs only.

01:12:37.503 --> 01:12:39.002
- Who knows?
- I know. I know.

01:12:39.003 --> 01:12:40.635
- Come on,
it's just a little excess.

01:12:40.637 --> 01:12:42.502
- If this doesn't show up
by the end of next year,

01:12:42.503 --> 01:12:44.068
then we can change subject,
I think.

01:12:44.069 --> 01:12:46.069
If you don't see
any supersymmetric signal...

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:48.301
- Well, but if it's 140,
that would be serious.

01:12:48.302 --> 01:12:49.701
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:49.702 --> 01:12:51.980
Yeah.

01:13:02.970 --> 01:13:04.904
Don't tell me.

01:13:04.905 --> 01:13:06.705
This is my nightmare.

01:13:08.703 --> 01:13:11.538
It's only 30 for me.

01:13:15.837 --> 01:13:17.571
At the moment, it's scary.

01:13:17.572 --> 01:13:19.726
- At the moment, it's scary.
- It's scary.

01:13:29.305 --> 01:13:32.503
- Yes, then we have to wait
another couple of years

01:13:32.504 --> 01:13:34.641
for the next round.

01:13:36.639 --> 01:13:38.909
No, another two years,
I'm saying...

01:13:42.574 --> 01:13:44.204
But still, it doesn't matter.

01:13:44.205 --> 01:13:45.576
You'll be working harder.

01:13:48.459 --> 01:13:50.037
No, but independent of that,

01:13:50.038 --> 01:13:54.505
I think you'll know the truth.

01:13:54.506 --> 01:13:56.238
Yes, yes, no.

01:13:56.239 --> 01:13:58.707
- And that's
the important thing.

01:13:59.706 --> 01:14:02.974
No, you're right.
Yes, of course.

01:14:05.971 --> 01:14:07.760
- Coffee
is a very serious business

01:14:08.039 --> 01:14:10.171
in the life of a theorist.

01:14:10.172 --> 01:14:12.304
It's not like physics research,

01:14:12.305 --> 01:14:14.172
where you can wait for 30 years

01:14:14.173 --> 01:14:18.805
before you know
if you are right.

01:14:18.806 --> 01:14:22.739
Within a few minutes,
it pays off.

01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:26.041
If you succeed, it's great.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.972
If you fail,
you get to try another one

01:14:29.973 --> 01:14:31.906
in another minute.

01:14:31.907 --> 01:14:33.840
In particle physics,

01:14:33.842 --> 01:14:37.838
you construct
a theory 20 years ago,

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.840
and it may take that long

01:14:39.841 --> 01:14:42.872
before you know
if you're on the right track.

01:14:42.874 --> 01:14:45.373
Jumping from failure to failure

01:14:45.374 --> 01:14:47.805
with undiminished enthusiasm

01:14:47.806 --> 01:14:51.972
is the big secret to success.

01:14:51.973 --> 01:14:58.307
- Well, the hint
that the Higgs was 140 GeV

01:14:58.308 --> 01:15:01.039
has disappeared.

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:06.174
All of the new data
that just came in

01:15:06.175 --> 01:15:08.674
didn't make the peak bigger.

01:15:08.675 --> 01:15:11.474
It sort of filled in the gaps.

01:15:11.475 --> 01:15:15.640
And now the peak
doesn't look very good.

01:15:15.641 --> 01:15:19.841
In fact, the belief
is that it's gone away

01:15:19.842 --> 01:15:25.175
and that the Higgs
can't be 140 GeV.

01:15:25.176 --> 01:15:28.475
In order for us to believe
that we've discovered it,

01:15:28.476 --> 01:15:30.175
that peak needs to be big

01:15:30.175 --> 01:15:33.408
and basically keep growing
as the data comes in.

01:15:33.409 --> 01:15:36.241
It's a statistical thing.

01:15:36.242 --> 01:15:38.675
We call it the Greek letter
"sigma."

01:15:38.676 --> 01:15:42.008
If you reach a height
of 5 sigma,

01:15:42.009 --> 01:15:45.407
that's when you know
that you've seen something.

01:15:45.408 --> 01:15:48.875
And the probability that
that just happens by accident

01:15:48.876 --> 01:15:52.379
is 1 in 31/2 million.

01:15:55.375 --> 01:15:59.241
But the Higgs, it's not at 140,

01:15:59.242 --> 01:16:01.642
which is a bit of a relief,

01:16:01.643 --> 01:16:06.309
because there's still hope
it might be down around 115.

01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:07.910
We like 115,

01:16:07.911 --> 01:16:10.309
because if the Higgs
is that light,

01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:13.308
the theory says
there has to be new particles,

01:16:13.309 --> 01:16:15.208
like supersymmetry,

01:16:15.209 --> 01:16:19.876
otherwise the universe
is unstable.

01:16:19.877 --> 01:16:22.679
It wouldn't have survived
this long.

01:16:24.976 --> 01:16:29.041
- This is one of the one
of the few truly perfect

01:16:29.042 --> 01:16:30.676
academic institutions
in the world.

01:16:30.677 --> 01:16:32.977
I mean, there's no excuse...

01:16:32.978 --> 01:16:34.676
no excuse at all...

01:16:34.677 --> 01:16:39.210
not to think and work

01:16:39.211 --> 01:16:40.810
and get things done.

01:16:40.810 --> 01:16:42.143
That's its only problem.

01:16:42.144 --> 01:16:43.743
There's no excuse at all
not to think

01:16:43.744 --> 01:16:45.643
and work and get things done.

01:16:45.644 --> 01:16:47.877
You can't blame it on anything
if it doesn't work.

01:16:47.878 --> 01:16:51.810
- Okay, supersymmetry
versus multiverse.

01:16:51.811 --> 01:16:54.044
Oh, boy.

01:16:57.211 --> 01:16:58.645
All right.

01:16:58.645 --> 01:17:00.144
That's, uh...

01:17:00.145 --> 01:17:01.543
If we're going to start
doing that,

01:17:01.544 --> 01:17:03.680
this is going to be interesting.

01:17:05.678 --> 01:17:08.511
We have been anticipating
that whatever happens

01:17:08.512 --> 01:17:10.845
is going to throw the field
in one direction or another.

01:17:10.846 --> 01:17:13.645
Oh, shit!

01:17:13.646 --> 01:17:15.344
Now that we're really
on the doorstep

01:17:15.345 --> 01:17:18.245
of actually knowing
the actual number,

01:17:18.246 --> 01:17:22.513
I really care intensely
about what that number is.

01:17:35.979 --> 01:17:38.012
Well, faster than we thought,

01:17:38.013 --> 01:17:40.913
there's news that there's
going to be another announcement

01:17:40.914 --> 01:17:43.178
about the Higgs.

01:17:43.179 --> 01:17:44.913
I've heard tons of rumors,

01:17:44.914 --> 01:17:46.812
and I've heard
they're things on blogs,

01:17:46.813 --> 01:17:49.579
and there's already stuff
in the newspaper.

01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:52.177
- 18 hours or so
until the announcement,

01:17:52.178 --> 01:17:56.313
so I'm really looking forward
to what they're going to say,

01:17:56.314 --> 01:17:58.546
and I want to be there.

01:17:58.547 --> 01:18:01.179
Actually, I'm thinking
of going early in the morning,

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:04.045
or I'll send
my young colleagues,

01:18:04.046 --> 01:18:09.413
who have more stamina to sit
and occupy a chair for me.

01:18:09.414 --> 01:18:12.178
It is July 3rd...

01:18:12.179 --> 01:18:15.048
the night of July 3, 2012,

01:18:15.049 --> 01:18:19.347
and I am driving to Princeton,
to the Institute,

01:18:19.348 --> 01:18:22.413
to hang out with Nima
and a big crowd,

01:18:22.414 --> 01:18:26.146
who are all staying up
until 3:00 in the morning

01:18:26.147 --> 01:18:30.547
because they're going to
present the Higgs data at CERN

01:18:30.548 --> 01:18:33.248
at 9:00 in the morning
Geneva time.

01:18:33.249 --> 01:18:35.381
Certainly the biggest thing
that's happened...

01:18:35.382 --> 01:18:37.748
the discovery
of new fundamental particles...

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:39.346
in my lifetime.

01:18:39.347 --> 01:18:42.180
And the Higgs is a particle
like no other,

01:18:42.181 --> 01:18:44.380
like nothing
we've ever seen before,

01:18:44.381 --> 01:18:46.914
and it is weird,
and we do not understand it,

01:18:46.915 --> 01:18:50.246
but...

01:18:50.247 --> 01:18:53.850
but, uh...
and I missed my exit.

01:19:57.651 --> 01:20:03.017
<i>Cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf.</i>

01:20:03.018 --> 01:20:04.583
- You need quite some skills
to sit on it.

01:20:04.584 --> 01:20:06.084
- It's possible.
- Okay.

01:20:06.085 --> 01:20:07.651
- You know,
there's one ball missing.

01:20:07.652 --> 01:20:09.984
Oh, it's, uh... exactly.

01:20:09.985 --> 01:20:11.550
No, there's one ball missing,

01:20:11.551 --> 01:20:15.350
so it's... you always
think you fall down.

01:20:15.351 --> 01:20:17.852
Okay.

01:20:17.853 --> 01:20:19.917
- Look at some of these people,
like, totally asleep.

01:20:19.918 --> 01:20:22.318
- Yeah, no,
those are the sleeping bags.

01:20:40.853 --> 01:20:42.351
My volume is up.

01:20:42.352 --> 01:20:44.186
I don't know why
I'm not getting sound.

01:20:44.187 --> 01:20:47.218
There isn't like, a thing
on here with sound, is there?

01:20:47.219 --> 01:20:49.751
Who reads lips here?

01:20:49.752 --> 01:20:52.253
- Can anyone see
if they get sound?

01:20:52.254 --> 01:20:54.453
Try streaming it
in their offices or something?

01:20:54.653 --> 01:20:57.281
Many apologies, guys.
I don't know what's going on.

01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:06.819
- Ah, Peter Higgs.
- Ah, there he is.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:08.555
- Here he is.
- Very good.

01:21:13.152 --> 01:21:16.320
Someone with an iPad.

01:21:28.854 --> 01:21:30.921
- Not as well seated
as my summer student.

01:21:30.922 --> 01:21:32.220
- No!
- Right.

01:21:33.383 --> 01:21:35.486
Peter Higgs doesn't even get
a good seat.

01:21:35.487 --> 01:21:38.153
- Good morning,
everybody here in Geneva.

01:21:38.154 --> 01:21:39.921
Today is a special day:

01:21:39.922 --> 01:21:42.353
we hear two presentations
from the two experiments

01:21:42.354 --> 01:21:43.921
ATLAS and CMS.

01:21:43.922 --> 01:21:46.420
We are starting
in a non-alphabetical order,

01:21:46.421 --> 01:21:50.855
and I ask Joe Incandela
from CMS to take the floor.

01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:53.859
Okay.

01:21:57.855 --> 01:21:59.487
Okay.

01:21:59.488 --> 01:22:03.888
So I will give the status
of the CMS Higgs search.

01:22:03.889 --> 01:22:06.388
I want to really dedicate this
to the CMS collaboration.

01:22:06.589 --> 01:22:08.521
This is a picture
we took last week.

01:22:08.522 --> 01:22:09.855
We had a party.

01:22:09.856 --> 01:22:11.519
This is only 400 or 500 people.

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:14.421
Remember, there are 4,000 people
in the experiment.

01:22:14.422 --> 01:22:16.854
This is not
the real CMS detector.

01:22:16.855 --> 01:22:18.354
That's down underground.

01:22:18.355 --> 01:22:20.406
This is the spare
that we keep upstairs.

01:22:22.323 --> 01:22:24.055
So one page for the theorists.

01:22:24.056 --> 01:22:26.522
That's all they deserve.
No, I'm kidding.

01:22:26.523 --> 01:22:29.988
The Standard Model is here...
is shown here.

01:22:29.989 --> 01:22:32.888
This is what we know.

01:22:39.658 --> 01:22:41.924
And we have now...

01:22:52.559 --> 01:22:54.822
But one of the big stories
of this year was,

01:22:54.823 --> 01:22:56.391
as you know...
those of you in the field...

01:22:56.392 --> 01:22:57.756
is pile-up.

01:22:57.757 --> 01:22:59.589
We had to deal
with very intense beams

01:22:59.589 --> 01:23:01.490
like never before seen
in the field

01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:02.723
with many, many interactions,

01:23:02.724 --> 01:23:04.557
and this slide shows...

01:23:04.558 --> 01:23:08.557
the colors correspond to tracks
from different particles.

01:23:08.558 --> 01:23:10.556
And it was in these
kind of events

01:23:10.557 --> 01:23:14.057
that we're looking for one of
the rarest particles ever made,

01:23:14.058 --> 01:23:16.025
and that's what we call
the Higgs.

01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:19.190
And so this is where
things stood last week.

01:23:19.191 --> 01:23:22.083
As you know, if you look
at the radiative corrections...

01:23:26.661 --> 01:23:28.924
So if you know the W
and top mass very well,

01:23:28.925 --> 01:23:30.924
you can actually predict
a long band.

01:23:30.925 --> 01:23:32.557
- Yeah, yeah,
so we're there at four.

01:23:32.558 --> 01:23:34.057
One at the Tevatron.

01:23:34.058 --> 01:23:35.990
They really had
a tour de force measurement.

01:23:35.991 --> 01:23:39.858
Ah, sorry, yeah, here it is.

01:23:39.859 --> 01:23:41.658
- And we end up
with four event classes...

01:23:41.659 --> 01:23:42.990
Ah, there it is!

01:23:42.991 --> 01:23:45.024
- Okay, so, to wrap up,
in summary:

01:23:45.025 --> 01:23:47.091
we conclude by saying
that we have observed

01:23:47.092 --> 01:23:51.494
a new boson with a mass
of 125.3 plus or minus 0.6 GeV

01:23:52.493 --> 01:23:54.358
at 4.9 standard deviations.

01:23:54.359 --> 01:23:55.593
Thank you.

01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:00.225
125.3.

01:24:00.226 --> 01:24:01.691
Okay, so now...

01:24:01.693 --> 01:24:02.494
Wow, 125?

01:24:03.494 --> 01:24:04.913
Do you know ATLAS's result?

01:24:05.493 --> 01:24:06.927
This isn't...

01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:09.871
You heard about this?

01:24:14.492 --> 01:24:16.258
Okay.

01:24:16.259 --> 01:24:18.825
I think I can only say
congratulations to everybody.

01:24:18.826 --> 01:24:21.259
I will say a few words more
later.

01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:24.426
Now we go immediately to ATLAS.

01:24:24.427 --> 01:24:25.892
Fabiola Gianotti, please.

01:24:25.893 --> 01:24:27.227
Thank you.

01:24:30.927 --> 01:24:32.425
Good morning.

01:24:32.426 --> 01:24:36.927
ATLAS is very pleased to present
here today

01:24:36.928 --> 01:24:39.492
updated results
on Standard Model Higgs searches

01:24:39.493 --> 01:24:44.259
based on up to 10.7
inverse femtobarn of data

01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:47.927
recorded in 2011 and 2012,

01:24:47.928 --> 01:24:51.360
and it's a big honor
and a big emotion for me

01:24:51.361 --> 01:24:55.227
to represent this fantastic
collaboration at this occasion.

01:24:55.228 --> 01:24:57.859
So let's go to the results
for this channel.

01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:02.359
You can see here
the results for the 2011 to 2012

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.759
and the combination of the two.

01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:06.827
The gamma jet
and jet-jet background

01:25:06.828 --> 01:25:08.594
with one or both jet...

01:25:08.595 --> 01:25:10.093
requirement that the energy

01:25:10.094 --> 01:25:12.661
in a cone around the photon
is below...

01:25:12.662 --> 01:25:14.494
a structure
which reproduces very well

01:25:14.495 --> 01:25:16.527
the LHC bunch rate
with three bunch,

01:25:16.528 --> 01:25:17.929
small gaps...

01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:19.613
so then, of course,
we collect...

01:25:25.530 --> 01:25:27.227
Yeah.

01:25:27.228 --> 01:25:30.694
- A few GeV and a few hundred
GeV at the level...

01:25:30.695 --> 01:25:32.894
is fit in the nine
different categories

01:25:32.895 --> 01:25:36.563
with an exponential function
to model the background,

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:38.160
so, no theoretical prediction,

01:25:38.161 --> 01:25:40.228
no Monte Carlo.

01:25:40.229 --> 01:25:43.194
The background is determined
from the side bands

01:25:43.195 --> 01:25:44.429
of the possible signal.

01:25:44.430 --> 01:25:46.329
From this spectrum,

01:25:46.330 --> 01:25:49.762
the background fit,
you get this plot here.

01:25:49.763 --> 01:25:51.428
Now the grand combination.

01:25:51.429 --> 01:25:52.994
Here it goes.

01:25:52.995 --> 01:25:54.727
- So this distribution
is extremely clean,

01:25:54.728 --> 01:26:01.095
except one big spike here...
in this region here.

01:26:01.096 --> 01:26:04.229
Excess with a local significance
of 5.0 sigma

01:26:04.230 --> 01:26:07.664
at a mass of 126.5 GeV.

01:26:30.365 --> 01:26:32.063
Good.

01:26:39.699 --> 01:26:42.830
As a layman, I would now say,

01:26:42.831 --> 01:26:45.198
"I think we have it."

01:26:52.231 --> 01:26:55.598
- Come, Lyn, come here.
- Come here!

01:27:06.232 --> 01:27:07.665
Okay.

01:27:07.666 --> 01:27:09.565
- There's Peter.
- Peter is there.

01:27:09.566 --> 01:27:11.564
- Yeah. Get Peter.
- Peter's there.

01:27:11.565 --> 01:27:13.365
Peter!

01:27:23.033 --> 01:27:25.665
- Well, I would like to add
my congratulations

01:27:25.666 --> 01:27:29.199
to everybody involved
in this tremendous achievement.

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:33.530
For me, it's really
an incredible thing

01:27:33.531 --> 01:27:35.666
that it has happened
in my lifetime.

01:27:35.667 --> 01:27:37.568
- Not only in your lifetime,
Peter.

01:27:48.066 --> 01:27:50.532
That's a great day, huh?

01:27:50.533 --> 01:27:51.932
That's a great day.

01:27:51.933 --> 01:27:53.732
And I think all of us,

01:27:53.733 --> 01:27:57.066
and all of the people
outside watching it

01:27:57.067 --> 01:27:59.333
in the different meeting rooms,

01:27:59.334 --> 01:28:02.166
everybody who was involved
and is involved in the project

01:28:02.167 --> 01:28:03.483
can be proud of this day.

01:28:04.233 --> 01:28:05.535
Okay, enjoy it.

01:28:08.233 --> 01:28:09.866
We found the Higgs!

01:28:14.901 --> 01:28:17.266
- Scientists
this morning announced

01:28:17.267 --> 01:28:19.066
they are almost certain
they have discovered

01:28:19.067 --> 01:28:21.001
what's being
called the "God Particle."

01:28:21.002 --> 01:28:22.500
It is not every day

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:24.167
that you see a whole bunch
of scientists

01:28:24.168 --> 01:28:27.366
standing up with champagne
bottles and cheering.

01:28:27.368 --> 01:28:29.534
- Now, the God Particle,
we physicists wince

01:28:29.535 --> 01:28:31.033
when we hear those words...

01:28:31.034 --> 01:28:32.902
- It's the last piece
of the puzzle

01:28:32.903 --> 01:28:34.534
physicists have been looking for
for decades.

01:28:34.535 --> 01:28:36.035
- Thank you all.
- Thank you for your attention.

01:28:36.036 --> 01:28:37.534
Thanks to everybody
on the panel.

01:28:37.536 --> 01:28:39.101
If I could just ask you all
to remain seated

01:28:39.102 --> 01:28:40.567
just for a few minutes.

01:28:40.568 --> 01:28:42.833
Clear passage here, please.

01:28:42.834 --> 01:28:44.533
Clear passage here, please.

01:28:44.534 --> 01:28:46.868
Can we have a clear passage?

01:28:46.869 --> 01:28:48.434
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:28:48.435 --> 01:28:49.835
Congratulations.

01:28:49.836 --> 01:28:52.570
Thank you. Thank you.

01:29:24.037 --> 01:29:31.002
- I did feel a sense of pride
when the Higgs was announced,

01:29:31.003 --> 01:29:34.869
but I felt a sense of pride
for humanity,

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:38.835
that, you know, we little people
on a little planet

01:29:38.836 --> 01:29:40.702
with tiny brains

01:29:40.703 --> 01:29:43.936
can go so deep
and understand what happens.

01:29:43.937 --> 01:29:47.404
Now we're talking
about subnuclear distances

01:29:47.405 --> 01:29:50.370
a thousand times smaller
than an atomic nucleus.

01:29:50.371 --> 01:29:52.870
Nevertheless,
we can get things right,

01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:56.175
and just the power
of the human mind.

01:29:59.171 --> 01:30:03.871
It's astonishing that there are
any laws of nature at all,

01:30:03.872 --> 01:30:07.939
that they're describable
by mathematics,

01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:13.071
that mathematics is a tool
that humans can understand,

01:30:13.072 --> 01:30:17.203
that the laws of nature
can be written on a page.

01:30:17.204 --> 01:30:20.840
It's the greatest
of all mysteries.

01:30:23.838 --> 01:30:30.604
There is a strong sense that we
are hearing nature talk to us.

01:30:30.605 --> 01:30:32.871
Turns out, the Higgs mass

01:30:32.872 --> 01:30:35.371
is about as interesting
as it could be.

01:30:35.372 --> 01:30:38.204
It's sort of in no man's land.

01:30:38.205 --> 01:30:40.372
It doesn't prefer symmetries,

01:30:40.373 --> 01:30:42.238
and it doesn't prefer
multiverse,

01:30:42.239 --> 01:30:43.940
but it's right in the middle.

01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:47.838
The data is puzzling enough

01:30:47.838 --> 01:30:52.705
that it hasn't excluded
any of the theories

01:30:52.706 --> 01:30:54.205
I was involved with,

01:30:54.206 --> 01:30:56.439
but it hasn't
confirmed them either.

01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:00.705
But until we look at detailed
properties of the Higgs,

01:31:00.706 --> 01:31:04.005
and until we have
the high-energy version

01:31:04.006 --> 01:31:07.172
of the LHC in a couple of years,

01:31:07.173 --> 01:31:10.674
we will not be able
to make a stronger statement.

01:31:13.341 --> 01:31:15.204
- The most important,
first lesson

01:31:15.205 --> 01:31:17.272
of the discovery of the Higgs

01:31:17.273 --> 01:31:20.105
is that physics works.

01:31:20.106 --> 01:31:21.774
The Higgs, on the one hand,

01:31:21.775 --> 01:31:24.074
completes the most successful
scientific theory

01:31:24.075 --> 01:31:25.408
we've ever had,

01:31:25.409 --> 01:31:27.240
on the other hand,
opens the door

01:31:27.241 --> 01:31:32.607
to some very major paradoxes
that we now must address.

01:31:32.608 --> 01:31:35.506
We're at a fork in the road,
and the LHC

01:31:35.507 --> 01:31:38.105
is steadfastly refusing
to push us

01:31:38.106 --> 01:31:40.242
in one direction or the other:

01:31:40.243 --> 01:31:42.007
the multiverse on the one side,

01:31:42.008 --> 01:31:46.608
and some beautiful symmetry
on the other side.

01:31:46.608 --> 01:31:50.415
It's cranking up the suspense
as much as it possibly can.

01:31:56.174 --> 01:31:58.541
- Before the LHC started,
we would always say,

01:31:58.542 --> 01:32:00.908
"New physics
is just around the corner."

01:32:00.909 --> 01:32:02.241
And now we're kind of like,

01:32:02.242 --> 01:32:03.942
"New physics
is still out there."

01:32:03.943 --> 01:32:07.174
And, for one,
I'm not discouraged by this,

01:32:07.175 --> 01:32:10.776
by any means, because we know

01:32:10.777 --> 01:32:12.778
that new physics
has to be out there.

01:32:14.776 --> 01:32:18.443
The next step is,
the LHC goes into a shutdown,

01:32:18.444 --> 01:32:22.108
stays off for two years
for improvements and upgrades,

01:32:22.109 --> 01:32:25.208
and when it returns, it's
going to be twice the energy.

01:32:25.209 --> 01:32:29.013
And for sure,
my vote's for supersymmetry.

01:32:33.009 --> 01:32:34.841
Jesus.

01:32:34.842 --> 01:32:36.108
That was exciting.

01:32:37.376 --> 01:32:39.876
If this is true,

01:32:39.877 --> 01:32:43.708
the Higgs is about 125 GeV,

01:32:43.709 --> 01:32:47.508
and that means...

01:32:47.509 --> 01:32:52.008
um, yeah, actually
almost all of my models

01:32:52.009 --> 01:32:53.709
are ruled out,

01:32:53.710 --> 01:32:56.610
which...
all the supersymmetry models,

01:32:56.611 --> 01:32:59.710
which is pretty cool.

01:32:59.711 --> 01:33:02.510
I mean, supersymmetry
could still be true,

01:33:02.511 --> 01:33:07.110
but it would have to be a very
strange version of the theory.

01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:09.510
And if it's the multiverse...

01:33:09.511 --> 01:33:13.210
well, other universes
would be amazing, of course,

01:33:13.211 --> 01:33:18.844
but it could also mean no
other new particles discovered,

01:33:18.845 --> 01:33:22.376
and then
a Higgs with a mass of 125

01:33:22.377 --> 01:33:27.244
is right at a critical point
for the fate of our universe.

01:33:27.245 --> 01:33:29.744
Without any other new particles,

01:33:29.744 --> 01:33:31.876
that Higgs is unstable.

01:33:31.877 --> 01:33:33.945
It's temporary.

01:33:33.946 --> 01:33:36.912
And since the Higgs
holds everything together,

01:33:37.911 --> 01:33:41.848
if the Higgs goes,
everything goes.

01:33:44.846 --> 01:33:46.511
It's amazing that the Higgs,

01:33:46.512 --> 01:33:48.711
the center
of the Standard Model,

01:33:48.712 --> 01:33:50.510
the thing we've all
been looking for,

01:33:50.511 --> 01:33:53.917
could actually also be the thing
that destroys everything.

01:33:58.913 --> 01:34:02.284
The creator and the destroyer.

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.110
But we could discover
new particles,

01:34:10.111 --> 01:34:12.716
and then none of that
would be true.

01:34:14.714 --> 01:34:17.766
And anyway,
we have something to do.

01:34:36.748 --> 01:34:41.179
<i>- There is a very nice sentence
in the Divine Comedy by Dante</i>

01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:44.779
<i>who says, "Nati
non fummo a viver come bruti,</i>

01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:48.681
<i>ma per seguir
virtute e canoscenza,"</i>

01:34:48.682 --> 01:34:51.014
which means, "We were not born

01:34:51.015 --> 01:34:52.512
"to live as animals,

01:34:52.513 --> 01:34:56.214
but to pursue knowledge
and virtue."

01:34:56.215 --> 01:34:58.913
So science and knowledge
are very important,

01:34:58.914 --> 01:35:02.248
like art is very important.

01:35:02.249 --> 01:35:05.246
It's a need of mankind.

01:35:05.247 --> 01:35:07.782
I just saw, two weeks ago,

01:35:07.783 --> 01:35:10.181
Werner Herzog talking about

01:35:10.182 --> 01:35:13.180
and then screening
his new movie.

01:35:13.181 --> 01:35:14.781
But it was about
these incredible caves

01:35:14.782 --> 01:35:17.014
that they discovered
a few years ago in France.

01:35:17.015 --> 01:35:18.513
Stunningly beautiful.

01:35:18.514 --> 01:35:21.715
Gorgeously drawn horses, bison,

01:35:21.716 --> 01:35:24.448
rhinoceros, lions,

01:35:24.449 --> 01:35:26.582
because, 40,000 years ago,

01:35:26.583 --> 01:35:28.416
this is what was going on there.

01:35:45.417 --> 01:35:50.115
- In exploration...
- and science is exploration...

01:35:50.116 --> 01:35:52.785
there needs to be
the set of people

01:35:53.784 --> 01:35:55.515
who have no rules,

01:35:55.516 --> 01:35:58.784
and they are going
into the frontier

01:35:59.783 --> 01:36:03.249
and come back
with the strange animals

01:36:03.250 --> 01:36:06.616
and the interesting rocks
and the amazing pictures,

01:36:06.617 --> 01:36:09.415
and to show us what's out there,

01:36:09.416 --> 01:36:11.624
discover something.

01:36:17.618 --> 01:36:20.083
Why do humans do science?

01:36:20.084 --> 01:36:22.784
Why do they do art?

01:36:22.785 --> 01:36:28.084
The things that are least
important for our survival

01:36:28.085 --> 01:36:30.743
are the very things
that make us human.
