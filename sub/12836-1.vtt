02:23.500 --> 02:25.658
I live for the World series, right?

02:25.794 --> 02:28.250
I grew up in California,
so I follow the Angels.

02:28.380 --> 02:31.001
But I was born in Chicago, right?
so I don't know who to root for!

02:31.133 --> 02:32.413
The Angels or the Cubs.

02:32.551 --> 02:36.501
If I say Angels, my dad'll kill me.
If I say Cubs, my friends'll kill me.

02:36.639 --> 02:40.138
I just can't wait!
so I've got seats behind home plate.

02:40.267 --> 02:44.265
...closed at 23 and MKR Industries
closed up at 48.

02:44.396 --> 02:47.682
It's a warmer 53 October degrees
in Chicago this morning.

02:47.817 --> 02:51.020
We have early morning low clouds
which should be clearing midday,

02:51.153 --> 02:53.526
and we should see a high of 65.

02:53.656 --> 02:56.906
But for now, let's return
to early morning classics.

03:06.252 --> 03:09.289
You're like a case study
in obsessive behaviour.

03:09.422 --> 03:11.462
l'm shaving.

03:13.259 --> 03:16.379
And l'm messing up
your shaving schedule.

03:19.599 --> 03:24.427
Just tell me you are not going
to do any work this weekend.

03:24.563 --> 03:26.602
l promise, no work.

03:27.357 --> 03:31.901
Last weekend was an emergency.
This weekend it's you and me

03:32.029 --> 03:36.358
and Lake Winnebago,
and l can't wait.

03:36.492 --> 03:39.243
Do you realise how long it's been?

03:39.370 --> 03:41.991
Let's see.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.119
spencer!

03:47.294 --> 03:51.162
As l recall...
it was very good.

04:00.600 --> 04:01.928
Elizabeth!

04:08.316 --> 04:10.143
Yes!

04:10.276 --> 04:11.936
- Oh, my God!
- Yes!

04:12.320 --> 04:13.779
- Oh, my God!
- Yes!

04:13.905 --> 04:16.610
- Oh, my God!
- Yes!

04:19.744 --> 04:22.449
promise me one more thing.

04:22.581 --> 04:25.950
l won't bring my filofax. l promise.

04:27.878 --> 04:30.914
The hometown fans need to
rally behind our Angels.

04:31.048 --> 04:33.539
I'll be down there to greet them
and I urge you to join me

04:33.675 --> 04:35.882
in welcoming them home
tomorrow morning at lAx.

04:36.011 --> 04:38.170
For one fan I have an added incentive.

04:38.305 --> 04:40.464
cream of shit, seven days a week.

04:40.599 --> 04:44.679
...correctly, two tickets to game 6
sunday in Anaheim will be yours.

04:44.812 --> 04:49.391
so, in honour of the Cubs, it's ''What
two Cubs pitched no-hitters in 197 2?''

04:49.525 --> 04:50.984
milt pappas. burt hooton.

04:51.110 --> 04:52.854

05:04.165 --> 05:05.957

05:06.084 --> 05:08.409

alone here, would l?

05:08.545 --> 05:10.454
come on, speech!

05:20.599 --> 05:23.304

winning the World series.

05:25.646 --> 05:27.804
And to big tits!

05:32.569 --> 05:34.692
hey, Warden!

05:34.822 --> 05:36.150
how you doing?

05:36.281 --> 05:40.529
Gentlemen, this is
an unauthorised festivity.

05:40.661 --> 05:45.122
These guys are just throwing
a going-away party, nothing big, special.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.705
Well, it's over.

05:49.462 --> 05:51.704
pull that banner down.

05:57.804 --> 06:01.552
mr Dworksi, this is a prison.

06:01.683 --> 06:04.174
not a discotheque.

06:04.310 --> 06:08.439
You're my responsibility until
your release time sunday night at 6:00.

06:08.565 --> 06:11.898
That's 60 hours.
understood?

06:13.361 --> 06:15.271
Yes, sir.

06:15.405 --> 06:16.650
Thank you.

06:18.241 --> 06:20.946
before he gets out of here,
l'll burn that troublemaker.

06:21.078 --> 06:22.453
Don't worry about it, Jimmy!

06:22.579 --> 06:25.117
We're still looking for a winner
for those tickets to game 6.

06:25.248 --> 06:27.407
now, this morning's question again,

06:27.543 --> 06:31.457
''What two Cubs pitched
no-hitters in 197 2?''

06:31.588 --> 06:35.088
The number to call, 555-77 20.

06:35.217 --> 06:37.922
They're giving tickets away

06:40.306 --> 06:45.762

Don't forget my frozen yogurt, baby.

07:03.997 --> 07:05.455

08:03.641 --> 08:05.848
he hopes the sale of the fifth
will be easier

08:05.977 --> 08:09.393
now that they've been widely advertised.

08:09.522 --> 08:10.518
Walter.

08:10.648 --> 08:12.725
This is such a shock.

08:12.859 --> 08:14.733
Ah, that's part of business, spencer.

08:16.738 --> 08:20.736
Listen, what do you know
about the high quality foods account?

08:21.660 --> 08:24.993
l read this morning that
sakamoto's Japanese syndicate

08:25.122 --> 08:27.873
bought high quality
and 86ed the GpG Agency.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.001
That's a huge account. huge account!

08:31.128 --> 08:32.955
spencer, l want it.

08:34.006 --> 08:36.626
l need you to take my place this weekend.

08:36.759 --> 08:38.751
- This weekend?
- You're going to L.A.

08:38.885 --> 08:42.669
You're going to pitch our ideas
for their new national campaign.

08:42.807 --> 08:46.341
something dynamic.
something with pretty girls.

08:47.853 --> 08:49.098
something wrong?

08:49.230 --> 08:52.147
Elizabeth and l were going to Wisconsin...

08:52.275 --> 08:55.608
sakamoto is flying out
just to see our campaign.

08:56.904 --> 09:00.404
They'll work through the weekend.
You'll meet him at the malibu Tennis club.

09:00.533 --> 09:03.203
sort of a ''get to know you'' kind of game.

09:03.328 --> 09:06.697
lt'll be a strategy review meeting
with the president.

09:06.831 --> 09:07.946
Diane connors.

09:08.083 --> 09:09.791
she's a nightmare.

09:09.918 --> 09:13.998
but you compliment her left and right,
you be very nice to her.

09:14.130 --> 09:15.755
You kiss her ass.

09:15.882 --> 09:20.295
- my wife and l were going to Wisconsin...
- lf you pull this thing off...

09:21.680 --> 09:25.381
you're looking at a senior vice-presidency.

09:25.517 --> 09:28.008
l'll cancel it.

09:33.192 --> 09:34.769
- Good one!
- very good.

09:36.654 --> 09:41.316
Warden, this is the first time in my life
that l've ever had good luck.

09:41.450 --> 09:42.992
l only got two days left.

09:43.119 --> 09:45.610
Jimmy, please.

09:46.747 --> 09:49.951
besides, if l let you go,
l'd have to let everybody go.

09:50.084 --> 09:54.378
lf l let everybody go,
this isn't a prison, it's a country club.

09:54.505 --> 09:58.254
l understand.
That's a good point, but you know

09:58.384 --> 10:01.385
it's the cubs in the World series.
lt's a dream of mine, sir.

10:01.512 --> 10:02.971
l know, l know.

10:03.097 --> 10:07.047
All right, l'm not gonna stand
in the way of anybody's dream, Jimmy.

10:08.395 --> 10:09.972
- l'll tell you what...
- What?

10:10.105 --> 10:13.106
lf l sink this putt, you can go.

10:13.233 --> 10:16.768
- What do you think of that?
- keep your head down,

10:16.903 --> 10:20.023
arms straight, drop your shoulder,
concentrate, focus.

10:20.157 --> 10:22.445
Think of the hole,
get the ball in the hole.

10:22.576 --> 10:26.075
smell the hot dogs, the crack of the bat,
the roar of the crowd.

10:26.204 --> 10:28.992
You can order your tickets now.

10:33.504 --> 10:36.670
Oh, shit! shit, shit, shit!

10:36.799 --> 10:40.250
Look, l'm sorry,
l know l deserve those 36 months.

10:40.386 --> 10:43.470
but l've been good, l haven't hurt anybody,
l've been good in here.

10:43.597 --> 10:45.839
mostly, a lot.

10:47.226 --> 10:50.393

A half a day. l'll make it up when

11:07.288 --> 11:10.657
Lighten up, will ya?
This game is so important to me.

11:10.792 --> 11:14.920
This is just a minimum security prison,
for christ's sake.

11:15.046 --> 11:18.712
l mean, a maximum minimum security
prison. lt's a tough prison.

11:18.842 --> 11:20.669
Take away his Tv privileges.

11:20.802 --> 11:24.752
You can't take away my Tv.

11:29.686 --> 11:33.435
- l didn't call him an asshole, did l?
- Yep.

11:33.565 --> 11:37.646
Take away everyone's Tv privileges
and let them know whose fault it is.

11:37.778 --> 11:39.985
no one is gonna watch the game.

11:40.114 --> 11:41.489
no, you can't...

11:42.450 --> 11:45.367
- no one watches the game!
- l didn't mean to call you an asshole.

11:45.494 --> 11:48.199
That's not what l meant.
l meant asswipe!

11:48.331 --> 11:50.407
And you, you look like an asshole!

11:50.541 --> 11:52.415
You look like another asshole!

11:54.587 --> 11:57.374

of the yellow page.

11:57.507 --> 12:01.125

Thanks, brenda.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.868

12:45.056 --> 12:49.053
Elizabeth, no, don't!
You love balloons!

12:49.185 --> 12:52.139
l have no choice.
What would you have said? no?

12:52.271 --> 12:57.064
maybe you would have said no, but this
could mean a senior vice-presidency.

12:57.193 --> 13:00.942
he's been dangling that
senior vice-presidency at you for years.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.444
- This is different.
- Again?

13:03.575 --> 13:04.689
Don't you see?

13:04.826 --> 13:09.868
he could have chosen clay or chris
or richard, but he chose me.

13:09.998 --> 13:13.449
Where are you going?
l've worked hard to work this hard.

13:13.585 --> 13:18.543

- A hotel.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.017
What hotel?

13:35.816 --> 13:37.773
All right!

13:43.824 --> 13:46.232

for the minimum security system.

14:14.648 --> 14:16.687
shut the fuck up, hamilton!

14:17.442 --> 14:21.107
We don't need violence.
What we need is organisation.

A work stoppage maybe?

14:28.996 --> 14:30.276
Out of here!

14:31.331 --> 14:34.167

Oh, my God!

15:55.960 --> 15:57.917
You used to cheat off me in history.

15:58.046 --> 15:59.041
That's right!

15:59.172 --> 16:02.541
You got me into
chicago community college.

16:02.675 --> 16:03.790
You did, thank you.

16:03.927 --> 16:05.919
so, are you two together?

16:06.054 --> 16:08.462
no? because my seat's over there.

16:08.598 --> 16:11.089
Why don't we switch
so spencer and l can reminisce?

16:11.226 --> 16:13.598
- Great!
- Ok.

16:13.728 --> 16:16.433
- l've got a lot of work.
- lt's Ok, l'll help you!

16:16.565 --> 16:18.937
- This is an event.
- no problem.

16:19.067 --> 16:21.356
- l'm happy to.
- You mind? l don't mind!

16:21.486 --> 16:23.728
You never know when
you'll bump into people.

16:23.864 --> 16:26.818
no. lt's amazing.

16:26.950 --> 16:28.824
Great! l love the window!

16:28.952 --> 16:31.194
- so, how are you?
- Oh, l'm...

16:31.330 --> 16:32.575
You know l'm in makeup?

16:32.706 --> 16:35.197
l was in chicago
for a moisturiser convention.

16:35.334 --> 16:39.663
so, what have you been up to
for the last 25 years? What?

16:41.966 --> 16:44.920
- They've barricaded themselves inside.
- What the hell do they want?

16:45.052 --> 16:46.796
To watch the World series.

16:46.929 --> 16:50.927
They've taken Jimmy Dworski hostage,
and won't let him go till after the game.

16:51.058 --> 16:54.593
- They love Dworski!
- not since you took away their Tv.

16:54.729 --> 16:56.009
Ah, shit!

16:56.939 --> 17:00.273
To watch the game, huh?
All right...

17:00.401 --> 17:02.608
This is the warden!

17:03.822 --> 17:05.280
This is the warden!

17:05.406 --> 17:07.198
cool it, it's the warden!

17:09.994 --> 17:11.453
What the hell's going on?

17:11.579 --> 17:14.035
Warden! Is that you?

17:14.165 --> 17:15.280
This is me.

17:15.416 --> 17:19.746
This is j.B.
We got a list of demands for you.

17:20.547 --> 17:24.296
First, we want a refrigerator in every cell.

17:29.765 --> 17:34.226
And oatmeal cookies
every Tuesday and Thursday.

17:39.859 --> 17:43.808
We want a laptop computer for hamilton.

17:48.159 --> 17:49.155
safe!

17:49.285 --> 17:52.120
And we're gonna watch
the World series game!

17:52.246 --> 17:56.493
And if you come in here,
we're gonna kill dworski.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.587
help me, man. help me.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.802
They've got me tied up, man.
They're gonna kill me.

18:07.929 --> 18:10.503
I don't want to die!

18:10.640 --> 18:12.763
I'm scared! help!

18:13.768 --> 18:15.097
hear that?

18:15.979 --> 18:21.021
We're not gonna surrender, Warden,
until after the game.

18:32.037 --> 18:35.204
Take me out to the ball game

18:35.332 --> 18:38.748
Take me out to the crowd

18:44.383 --> 18:47.883
Then l got divorced again last year,
but everyone saw that one coming.

18:48.012 --> 18:51.595
Alan worked for nAsA,
but he was no rocket scientist.

18:51.724 --> 18:55.224
now l'm on the prowl.
lt's hard to find a good man.

19:06.865 --> 19:08.774
Yeah... Yeah!

19:11.161 --> 19:13.866
l gotta shop here more often.

19:24.383 --> 19:25.296
hey!

19:25.425 --> 19:27.963
Do you have a favourite designer?

19:28.095 --> 19:31.796
You should. mine's carl Lagerfeld.
l think he's great.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.642
lt's the Angels.

19:35.144 --> 19:36.686
Oh, my God!

19:38.272 --> 19:42.317
l love baseball players.
They're so big.

19:45.321 --> 19:49.319
here you go, Jimmy.
congratulations. Enjoy the game.

19:49.450 --> 19:52.321
Any words to the Angel fans
out here, Jimmy?

19:53.579 --> 19:54.777
Yeah, stu.

19:54.914 --> 19:58.698
cubs are gonna kick butt! Yeah!

20:07.761 --> 20:09.884
Where is he?

20:11.431 --> 20:14.052
- need a ride, spencer?
- no, thanks. l'm being met.

20:16.978 --> 20:19.932
There's a reason
we were on that flight together.

20:20.065 --> 20:22.141
We were both going to LA.

20:24.194 --> 20:26.816
l'm talking about karma, spencer.

20:26.947 --> 20:29.782
About infinite possibility.

20:29.908 --> 20:31.071
About us.

20:32.494 --> 20:35.246
l understand about this natalie person.

20:35.372 --> 20:36.321
Elizabeth.

20:36.457 --> 20:39.624
All l'm saying is,
l think you're on the rebound.

20:39.752 --> 20:42.622
no, l'm happily married, honestly.

20:42.755 --> 20:44.997
All l'm saying is...

20:48.302 --> 20:51.387
l'm your friend in LA.
l want you to have my number.

20:53.015 --> 20:55.637
- Thanks.
- Don't be afraid to call me.

20:55.768 --> 20:57.808
Thanks a lot.

20:57.937 --> 21:00.013
Ok.

21:00.148 --> 21:02.105
- l appreciate it.
- call me.

21:02.233 --> 21:04.309
Goodbye.

21:07.322 --> 21:09.315
Ah, no...

21:12.619 --> 21:17.032
The white zone is for loading and
unloading of passengers only.

21:17.165 --> 21:18.790
no parking.

21:31.722 --> 21:35.423
You've reached the barnes' residence.
please leave a message.

21:35.559 --> 21:39.557
Elizabeth, l just want to say
l love you.

21:39.688 --> 21:42.606
l miss you already
and l'm really sorry.

21:42.733 --> 21:46.601
l'm in the terminal
and l love you very much.

21:46.737 --> 21:48.362
l'll try to be better.

21:48.489 --> 21:51.574
l love you very much.
Talk to you soon.

22:00.376 --> 22:03.164
- hello?
- brenda, listen, my luggage is lost.

22:03.296 --> 22:06.416
The car's not here.
l can't be late for these meetings.

22:06.549 --> 22:09.883
t ou're lucky you caught me.
I'm on my way out.

22:10.011 --> 22:12.502
hold on, I have to get the limo number.

22:12.639 --> 22:14.632
l see him! l'll talk to you later.

22:15.934 --> 22:17.974
Driver! chauffeur driver!

22:18.103 --> 22:19.597
barnes!

22:29.823 --> 22:31.863
Yeah, baby, yeah.

22:32.576 --> 22:35.696
no, l swear l wasn't cheating on you.

22:36.247 --> 22:38.619
no, it was just a friend.

22:52.096 --> 22:55.014
¤1 ,000 reward?

22:55.141 --> 22:56.421
1 ,000 bucks!

23:00.480 --> 23:02.271
What the hell's wrong with you?

23:02.398 --> 23:04.806
We're not getting any younger!

23:05.443 --> 23:07.650
This is a mess.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.199
- hello.
- spencer.

23:13.326 --> 23:14.702
how are you feeling?

23:14.828 --> 23:18.956
rotten. When you play tennis
with sakamoto, lose.

23:19.082 --> 23:20.874
he's really competitive.

23:21.001 --> 23:23.207
Your losing will show respect.

23:23.337 --> 23:24.747
Absolutely.

23:25.506 --> 23:31.378
That's great because l'm going
to be tested... for a bypass.

23:31.512 --> 23:33.754
Oh, Walter, a bypass?

23:33.889 --> 23:36.807
now don't worry, spencer.

23:36.934 --> 23:40.220
You get the account and l'll live.

23:40.354 --> 23:41.683
consider it done.

23:42.481 --> 23:44.640
- bye.
- goodbye.

23:54.494 --> 23:56.570
- have you seen my filofax?
- nope.

23:56.704 --> 23:58.827
Oh, my God! my life is in there.

24:05.755 --> 24:07.166
meet me at the terminal!

24:07.298 --> 24:10.216
l can't. l've got
an important pickup in 45 minutes.

24:32.908 --> 24:33.939
Wow!

24:34.076 --> 24:36.863
This guy's loaded!

24:36.996 --> 24:37.991
man.

24:38.122 --> 24:39.237
Thanks.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.583
- have a nice day!
- lf the cubs win, it'll be a great day.

25:04.482 --> 25:07.317
The flintstones must live here.

25:07.444 --> 25:09.520
big lake!

25:16.328 --> 25:18.036
Yes, sir!

25:19.164 --> 25:20.623
surf's up!

25:37.975 --> 25:39.517
Ok, thank you.

25:41.145 --> 25:43.019
membership has its privileges.

25:43.147 --> 25:45.899
They Oked your credit
even without your card.

25:46.025 --> 25:46.641
Great!

25:50.071 --> 25:52.028
- Today's not your day.
- Why?

25:52.156 --> 25:56.617
lt's the World series weekend
and we're all out of cars.

25:56.744 --> 25:59.152
no, l must have a car!

25:59.289 --> 26:02.492
ln 20 minutes, l have
the most important business meeting.

26:02.625 --> 26:05.911
l must have a car. Anything, please!

26:06.046 --> 26:09.000
- Well, there is one.
- l'll take it!

26:09.132 --> 26:13.130
- but it's due for body work.
- That's all right. Let me have it.

26:30.529 --> 26:32.985
''spencer barnes.''

26:33.115 --> 26:35.986
credit cards.

26:36.118 --> 26:37.778
more credit cards.

26:38.662 --> 26:40.240
Lots of credit cards.

26:41.707 --> 26:43.664
phone numbers.

26:46.462 --> 26:48.087
power words.

26:48.214 --> 26:49.957
first-rate.

26:50.091 --> 26:51.419
phenomenal.

26:51.551 --> 26:53.508
superlative.

26:54.512 --> 26:56.220
benevolent.

26:56.347 --> 26:57.925
bullshit.

27:00.059 --> 27:04.353
Alarm instructions?

27:11.238 --> 27:12.483
All right.

27:17.995 --> 27:20.236
Yeah! sweet.

27:29.882 --> 27:31.293
Wow!

27:34.595 --> 27:36.255
l'm on fuckin' dynasty.

27:38.140 --> 27:42.886
Yeah! All right!

28:18.724 --> 28:20.266
cute.

28:25.439 --> 28:27.645
That's a weird couch.

28:44.792 --> 28:47.117
l bet the chicks dig this place.

28:49.505 --> 28:54.333
...at the Milton K. prochik
Correctional Facility for a live update

28:54.469 --> 28:56.212
on the World series strike.

28:56.346 --> 28:58.422
no violence has yet been reported.

28:58.556 --> 29:01.641
still, this minimum security prison
World series strike

29:01.768 --> 29:05.848
could be the most unique
human interest story of the year.

29:05.981 --> 29:09.480
To get a better assessment,
let's talk with the warden,

29:09.609 --> 29:13.477
Mr. Frank Toolman, at
the Milton K. prochik Correctional Facility.

29:13.613 --> 29:16.899
let me get your appraisal
of what's going on here.

29:17.034 --> 29:20.284
This is not a serious situation.
It does not call for violence.

29:20.412 --> 29:23.911
They're men of good will
and we're currently talking.

29:24.041 --> 29:26.413
so, there's no reason for violence.

29:27.795 --> 29:29.668
This is relaxing.

29:29.797 --> 29:34.423
not at all. It's indicative
of a slight miscommunication.

29:38.722 --> 29:43.266
We're currently in negotiations.
The situation will be under control soon.

29:43.477 --> 29:45.885
l don't think so!

29:46.022 --> 29:49.438
A small demand. small concession.

29:50.985 --> 29:54.152
t ou're certain the situation
can be handled without violence?

29:54.280 --> 29:55.276
Don't move.

30:00.370 --> 30:02.991
- Yeah?
- Airline, l got your luggage.

30:03.123 --> 30:04.533
my luggage?

30:04.666 --> 30:06.041
You spencer barnes?

30:06.167 --> 30:07.330
That's me.

30:07.460 --> 30:09.702
Great. nice place.

30:09.838 --> 30:11.036
no shit.

30:35.406 --> 30:36.651
Excuse me?

30:36.782 --> 30:38.656
pardon me!

30:38.784 --> 30:40.409
Excuse me?

30:40.536 --> 30:44.035
could you direct me
to the san Diego freeway?

30:48.503 --> 30:52.121
Yeah... Go two blocks down
and take a right.

30:52.256 --> 30:54.463
Two blocks down and take a right?

30:55.718 --> 30:57.213
Thanks a lot.

30:57.345 --> 30:59.551
l appreciate it. Thanks a lot.

31:03.518 --> 31:06.389
- no money?
- l lost my filofax. l lost all my money.

31:06.521 --> 31:07.896
he's clean, man.

31:08.023 --> 31:09.137
- no money?
- no money.

31:13.487 --> 31:15.360
What? no!

31:16.448 --> 31:19.021
no!

31:30.254 --> 31:33.374
man, l need to get one of these in my cell.

31:33.507 --> 31:36.045
sometimes he's the most loving guy,

31:36.177 --> 31:39.213
and sometimes he's inconsiderate
of my feelings.

31:39.346 --> 31:40.971
Talk to him.

31:41.098 --> 31:44.302
But tell him that you
really would like to have

31:44.435 --> 31:50.639
a straightforward talk
and see what the results would be.

31:50.775 --> 31:53.147
I tried, I really tried.

31:53.277 --> 31:55.603
he's a very hard person to talk to.

31:55.738 --> 31:58.027
I really love him...

31:58.157 --> 32:00.316
Ditch him. find a better guy.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.528
Confront him in an honest way.

32:02.662 --> 32:05.200
Be straightforward and talk.

32:05.332 --> 32:07.657
By ignoring your situation,

32:07.792 --> 32:10.497
you are lying to yourself.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.835
If this really matters to you,

32:12.964 --> 32:17.543
get it clear in your head
what you want to say.

32:17.678 --> 32:20.548
Then tell him.
don't play games.

32:20.681 --> 32:21.760
not bad.

32:21.890 --> 32:26.433
I think you're right.
Maybe I just haven't been honest.

32:26.562 --> 32:29.053
This guy is worth it.

32:29.189 --> 32:31.182
spencer barnes, where are you?

32:48.876 --> 32:50.952
- spencer barnes.
- hi, ned bradford.

32:51.087 --> 32:54.373
Junior vp, high quality foods.

32:54.507 --> 32:57.923
mike stewart, assistant to the president.
lt's a pleasure.

32:58.052 --> 33:01.552
- so, you ready for the big game?
- Yeah, l won two tickets!

33:04.267 --> 33:06.805
Walter wanted to get these
to you as soon as possible.

33:13.193 --> 33:15.980
l think there's a high quality girl
in there.

33:16.113 --> 33:19.564
These are high quality girls, all right.
check this one out.

33:19.700 --> 33:20.898
nice, huh?

33:21.034 --> 33:23.407
sakamoto wants
to choose the girl himself.

33:23.537 --> 33:26.953
but l'm sure he's curious to hear you
dimensionalise once you meet them.

33:27.082 --> 33:30.368
me? l get to meet these girls?

33:30.502 --> 33:32.127
You get to meet all of them.

33:32.254 --> 33:34.745
l got a great fucking job, don't l?

33:34.882 --> 33:37.005
Listen, we ought to get going.

33:37.134 --> 33:39.886
You know how important punctuality
is to mr sakamoto.

33:40.012 --> 33:42.717
You really should put on your togs.

33:44.559 --> 33:45.554
Togs?

33:47.353 --> 33:49.013
This is gonna be fun, guys.

33:49.147 --> 33:50.475
Don't go away.

33:51.691 --> 33:55.060
Togs? What the hell are togs?

33:55.194 --> 33:57.271
Togs!

33:58.573 --> 34:00.649
Where the hell are my togs?

34:27.770 --> 34:29.393
Oh, my God.

34:36.112 --> 34:37.820
We're happy with the new plan.

34:37.947 --> 34:42.656
With expanded exposure, we're confident
we can increase our net-net by 30%%.

34:42.784 --> 34:43.781
Whatever.

34:43.911 --> 34:48.620
- What about the new slogans?
- first-rate, phenomenal.

34:48.748 --> 34:52.368
superlative. Diane is very anxious
to hear them. so is big sak.

34:52.503 --> 34:54.377
- big mac?
- no, mr. sakamoto.

35:01.304 --> 35:03.878
- What's up?
- Glad to meet you, mr. barnes.

35:04.015 --> 35:05.759
Yes.

35:09.646 --> 35:11.639
Where are the girls?

35:14.151 --> 35:17.068
l thought we could meet the girls now
and play ball later.

35:17.195 --> 35:19.437
Tennis now. business later.

35:21.158 --> 35:23.827
l haven't checked out tennis in a while.

35:24.536 --> 35:27.988
modesty. An admirable quality.

35:30.417 --> 35:32.077
l can't play worth a shit.

35:32.211 --> 35:35.331
That's good.
remember, this is client tennis.

35:35.464 --> 35:37.753
You ready for a little action?

35:37.883 --> 35:40.339
You bet your ass l am.

35:43.431 --> 35:44.889
spencer, we're on this side.

35:47.018 --> 35:49.473
Tennis relaxes the nerves.

35:50.063 --> 35:52.814
prepares us for better business.

35:52.940 --> 35:54.518
may the best man win.

36:24.098 --> 36:25.508
Good catch!

36:25.641 --> 36:28.013
slippery handle!

36:31.855 --> 36:33.136
nice catch.

36:35.276 --> 36:37.482
l got it, just give me a second.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.738
l'm up to bat.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.525
You need any talc?

36:44.827 --> 36:45.741
Ok.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.115
Ok, shoot!

36:54.629 --> 36:56.207
Defective shot!

36:57.090 --> 36:59.960
All right. Let's play ball!

37:00.802 --> 37:04.052
This is a disaster.
Everything was in my filofax.

37:04.180 --> 37:06.138
my schedule, my sales charts.

37:06.266 --> 37:09.386
l don't even have Walter's number.
he's unlisted.

37:09.519 --> 37:11.227
my money, my credit cards.

37:11.354 --> 37:16.396
l knew you'd call. l got home,
looked at the phone and said, ''ring.''

37:16.526 --> 37:20.394
lt did. When the operator said,
''collect call from spencer barnes,''

37:20.531 --> 37:21.645
my face lit up.

37:21.782 --> 37:24.403
lf Walter hears how l screwed up,

37:24.535 --> 37:27.405
he'll have another heart attack.
Then imagine the guilt!

37:27.538 --> 37:31.322
california's so romantic.
Wanna go for a walk on the beach?

37:31.458 --> 37:33.083
l've got a meeting to go to.

37:33.210 --> 37:36.994
l've gotta face these people empty-handed.
l can't even remember the slogans.

37:37.131 --> 37:41.592
spencer, l used to have a crush on you.

37:46.432 --> 37:48.472
sorry!

37:48.601 --> 37:50.677
Learn how to drive. sorry.

37:52.772 --> 37:56.984
l don't know. sometimes,
l lose control of myself.

37:58.903 --> 38:02.818
l've been going through
a rough period lately, spencer.

38:02.949 --> 38:04.906
my dog maybelline died recently.

38:05.035 --> 38:10.029
she was so outgoing... and intelligent.

38:11.041 --> 38:14.291
she was... here, l've got this picture.

38:14.419 --> 38:16.328
she was a capricorn.

38:17.047 --> 38:18.506
lsn't she sweet?

38:18.632 --> 38:24.089
- she doesn't even look sick.
- That's an old picture.

38:24.221 --> 38:27.970
Let me cook dinner for you.
lt'll be a blast.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.425
come on... please!

38:30.561 --> 38:31.936
This is not a good time.

38:32.062 --> 38:34.600
- Why?
- Do you know how to get to malibu?

38:36.484 --> 38:38.975
maybe.

38:47.161 --> 38:48.703
l got it!

38:56.880 --> 39:00.664
- l'm bad. l'm really bad.
- Don't you think we ought to lose?

39:00.800 --> 39:03.042
- Lose? Why?
- because sakamoto wants to win.

39:03.178 --> 39:04.720
so do l, mike.

39:05.430 --> 39:07.008
come on, l'm bad.

39:12.521 --> 39:14.394
Triple set point.

39:35.002 --> 39:37.327
- What happened?
- We won.

39:37.463 --> 39:38.542
We won?

39:40.216 --> 39:41.378
We won!

39:41.509 --> 39:42.540
Well played, sir.

39:45.596 --> 39:47.803
- Good match, mr. barnes.
- Thank you.

39:47.932 --> 39:50.388
until this afternoon.

39:55.106 --> 39:56.648
What's with mr. Attitude?

39:56.774 --> 40:01.022
- has he never lost before?
- not to an employee.

40:01.154 --> 40:02.482
mr. spencer barnes!

40:02.614 --> 40:04.405
- me!
- Telephone.

40:04.532 --> 40:06.276
phone, yes.

40:07.160 --> 40:09.069
- Telephone, huh?
- for you, sir.

40:09.204 --> 40:10.864
l wonder who it could be.

40:15.961 --> 40:18.713
- Yeah, what's up?
- Thank god I found you.

40:18.839 --> 40:21.626
Walter's under anaesthetic.
We have an emergency.

40:21.758 --> 40:24.676
honey nut Bakery needs
their new slogan immediately.

40:24.803 --> 40:28.967
I know Walter had something in mind,
but I can't remember what.

40:30.434 --> 40:31.976
check out those buns!

40:32.102 --> 40:33.929
great. Thanks.

40:36.649 --> 40:37.929
hello?

40:40.695 --> 40:41.477

40:44.782 --> 40:46.157
Thanks a lot.

40:46.284 --> 40:49.119

- l'm sure.

40:49.245 --> 40:50.953
- Thanks a lot.
- have fun.

40:54.042 --> 40:55.915
- sorry!
- Watch it.

40:57.045 --> 40:58.504
l almost lost this baby.

40:59.255 --> 41:01.165
We have children in this house.

41:01.299 --> 41:04.502
- Broken glass is...
- Excuse me.

41:05.553 --> 41:06.668
could you help me?

41:08.640 --> 41:10.015
Oh, of course l can.

41:10.142 --> 41:12.467
here's a dollar.

41:12.602 --> 41:14.844
might be some leftovers
behind the restaurant.

41:14.980 --> 41:16.355
Leftovers?

41:16.481 --> 41:18.308

- Yes.

41:27.284 --> 41:30.451
- l'm spencer barnes.
- really? You're spencer barnes?

41:30.579 --> 41:35.372
some very important materials in a
suitcase were sent to mr. bentley's house.

41:35.501 --> 41:39.285
- l must have his address.
- l'm not authorised...

41:39.422 --> 41:42.541
- This is urgent!
- search the rolodex, l'll break your arms.

41:42.675 --> 41:45.759
- You'll break my arms?
- That's right.

41:45.887 --> 41:49.587
for your information, spencer barnes
was here and he just left.

41:49.724 --> 41:54.185

'cause l'm spencer barnes.

41:54.312 --> 41:56.305

41:56.439 --> 41:57.898
That's right!

41:58.024 --> 41:59.684
Take it outside!

41:59.818 --> 42:03.021
Anyway, l get home
and harold is sitting in his chair.

42:03.154 --> 42:04.530
not saying a word.

42:04.656 --> 42:06.945
he's watching Tv,
sitting like a turtle.

42:07.075 --> 42:11.369
l say to him, ''hello, harold!''

42:12.247 --> 42:13.528
he didn't answer.

42:13.665 --> 42:16.785
finally l say to him, look, harold,
it's been this way for a month.

42:16.919 --> 42:19.207
he says to me finally, ''Tuna fish.''

42:19.338 --> 42:23.252
Tuna fish, he's talking
about my damn tuna fish.

42:37.148 --> 42:39.271

42:55.667 --> 42:57.042

42:57.168 --> 42:58.164

43:04.301 --> 43:07.255

Thank you, God!

43:39.754 --> 43:42.459
Wow, this feels great!

43:43.674 --> 43:45.916
Water, you know.

43:46.052 --> 43:48.377
- Wanna join me?

44:01.609 --> 44:04.314

44:17.501 --> 44:19.209
That's me.

44:20.879 --> 44:22.290
That's a beauty.

44:22.423 --> 44:25.673
Yeah, this is the nEc powermate Two.

44:25.801 --> 44:28.885
286 cpu, two 8-bit full-size slots.

44:29.763 --> 44:34.010
40 mb internal tape drive back-up,
40 mb hard drive?

44:34.143 --> 44:35.518
80!

44:36.812 --> 44:39.101

44:40.107 --> 44:42.266
Do you mind? can l just take a look?

44:42.401 --> 44:43.860
not at all.

44:44.862 --> 44:48.990
- This is a real treat.
- lt's a real treat for me.

44:49.117 --> 44:51.240
no one ever comes in here.

44:56.583 --> 44:59.252
boy, we got a lot of members!

44:59.377 --> 45:00.836
There l am!

45:00.962 --> 45:02.421
Excuse me.

45:02.547 --> 45:04.872
lra breen. club accountant.

45:06.176 --> 45:07.635

45:10.138 --> 45:11.882
can l ask you something?

45:12.015 --> 45:14.055
- honestly.
- sure.

45:14.184 --> 45:17.102
What do you think about my father?

45:17.229 --> 45:20.645
l don't know.
l never really think of him.

45:27.531 --> 45:30.283
This heart attack thing
has really made me think.

45:30.409 --> 45:34.656
Just about the big picture,
about how superficial our relationship is.

45:36.374 --> 45:38.781
he's so involved in his work.

45:40.628 --> 45:43.499
lt's like he doesn't even know who l am.

45:44.173 --> 45:48.385
And if l ever sound unhappy,
he sends me a check.

45:48.511 --> 45:50.587
- A check?
- Well...

45:54.893 --> 45:58.677
- Why don't you try talking to him?
- no one talks to my father.

46:00.106 --> 46:02.063
You know that.

46:02.192 --> 46:04.564
he sits and does all the talking.

46:11.451 --> 46:13.907
Try confronting him in a honest way.

46:14.037 --> 46:18.165
be straightforward and true.

46:19.501 --> 46:21.375
With Walter bentley?

46:22.713 --> 46:26.663
by ignoring your own situation,
you're only lying to yourself.

46:27.635 --> 46:30.256
lf it really matters to you,

46:30.387 --> 46:33.472
get it clear in your head
what you want to say and say it.

46:33.599 --> 46:34.678
Don't play games.

46:43.985 --> 46:45.443
You think?

46:48.906 --> 46:51.611
There is something
very different about you.

46:52.327 --> 46:53.987
Yeah, there is.

46:58.249 --> 46:59.494
l don't know what it is,

46:59.626 --> 47:04.039
but you're not the typical anal
yuppie l guess l was expecting.

47:04.381 --> 47:07.086
Definitely not.
l've never been one of the those.

47:10.595 --> 47:13.169
- What are you doing for dinner?
- Dinner?

47:13.306 --> 47:16.972
- You've got plans.
- for dinner? plans? no way.

47:17.102 --> 47:19.308
l don't even have one plan.

47:19.438 --> 47:22.107
l'm available.

47:29.990 --> 47:33.194
Great. so... pick me up at 8:00?

47:34.578 --> 47:36.904
8:00 would be great!

47:43.671 --> 47:45.545
Yeah!

47:45.673 --> 47:47.215

47:59.270 --> 48:03.019

48:03.149 --> 48:07.017

and l'd like to speak to him now?

48:07.154 --> 48:09.193

48:09.322 --> 48:12.738
spencer, it's Elizabeth.

48:12.868 --> 48:15.988
Tell her l'll call her back.

48:17.581 --> 48:19.574
he's gonna have to call you back.

48:19.708 --> 48:22.875
Tell him not to bother.

48:25.923 --> 48:30.300
You have no idea how grateful l am.
Thank you very much.

48:30.427 --> 48:33.678
l was just leaving the house,
about to close the door...

48:33.806 --> 48:35.134
and l thought of you.

48:35.266 --> 48:37.009
Just then, the phone rang.

48:37.143 --> 48:39.301
l'm telling you, it's karma.

48:56.496 --> 48:58.287
Can you believe what I just said?

48:58.415 --> 49:02.199
If you've got a credit card,
you'd be crazy not to call now.

49:02.335 --> 49:06.997
For a limited time, we'll call it
our World series special.

49:07.132 --> 49:12.008

50:18.163 --> 50:20.370
We can't, really.
We don't have time.

50:20.499 --> 50:21.697
shall we?

50:21.834 --> 50:22.948
shall we what?

50:23.085 --> 50:26.121
- We've got a meeting.
- This is getting complicated.

50:26.255 --> 50:30.833
You ought to put your suit on.
Diane's pretty compulsive about her time.

50:34.597 --> 50:37.681
l'd love to go, guys,
but l've got a hot date.

50:37.808 --> 50:40.050
- A date?
- With a chick.

50:40.186 --> 50:43.519
We understand you do things
a little differently.

50:43.648 --> 50:47.562
Ted and l like it, but if you miss
this meeting, it's business suicide.

50:47.694 --> 50:49.236
l'll be in deep shit?

50:49.362 --> 50:50.690
precisely.

50:52.073 --> 50:54.825
- l get to ride in that?
- Yeah.

50:54.951 --> 50:56.860
homies, l'll be back in a sec.

50:58.288 --> 50:59.533
homies?

51:01.958 --> 51:05.826
Yes, sir. uh-huh.

51:05.962 --> 51:11.752
hmm... no. hmm... no.
no.

51:18.725 --> 51:21.929
no, no, no, no... yes.

51:29.528 --> 51:36.361
spencer barnes... You look first-rate.

51:36.494 --> 51:38.451
phenomenal.

51:38.579 --> 51:40.073
superlative.

51:40.206 --> 51:42.245
And benevolent.

51:44.752 --> 51:46.496
fuckin' A, man.

51:56.556 --> 51:58.632
...five four.

52:03.980 --> 52:05.012
Ok.

52:07.526 --> 52:09.234
Thanks a lot, Debbie.

52:09.361 --> 52:12.564
- sure you're not free for din-din?
- no, l really am.

52:12.698 --> 52:14.192
next time, l promise.

52:14.324 --> 52:19.911
lf you change your mind, l work
at the cosmetic counter at l magnin.

52:20.038 --> 52:22.197
- l take lunch between 1 :00 and 2:00.
- Goodbye!

52:22.332 --> 52:24.409
Ask for susan.
susan will come get me.

52:28.339 --> 52:30.497
Wait! l'm here!

52:30.633 --> 52:33.171
come back! l'm here!

53:00.914 --> 53:01.993
Oh, no!

54:25.167 --> 54:27.041
l'll kill him!

54:43.895 --> 54:45.638
- hello?
- spencer!

54:45.772 --> 54:49.900
- Walter!
- l told you to lose to sakamoto.

54:50.735 --> 54:54.234
l heard you beat him
in three straight sets.

54:54.364 --> 54:56.072
That wasn't me!

54:56.199 --> 54:58.772
What do you mean?
Take responsibility.

54:58.910 --> 55:00.950
lt was somebody else.

55:01.079 --> 55:06.702
Yes, and he's been screwing up.
l'm getting chest pains.

55:07.669 --> 55:12.331
Go out and get that account, damn it!

55:12.466 --> 55:14.458
Walter, let me explain...

55:17.513 --> 55:19.256
freeze!

55:20.891 --> 55:22.599
man, l don't know.

55:22.726 --> 55:25.264
- What's the matter? You nervous?
- kind of.

55:25.396 --> 55:28.562
Don't worry about Diane.
relax.

55:28.691 --> 55:30.933
- be yourself.
- Like us.

55:31.068 --> 55:34.271
Diane. ls philip there, please?

55:36.866 --> 55:38.858
l'll be with you in a minute.

55:38.993 --> 55:39.989
This one?

55:40.119 --> 55:42.906
l don't want excuses,
l want results.

55:43.039 --> 55:46.823
- l want you to finish that report...
- can l get you a drink?

55:46.959 --> 55:50.542
- l'll have a gimlet.
- same.

55:51.381 --> 55:53.872
Do you have that tequila
with the worms in it?

55:54.008 --> 55:57.840
- no.
- Then l'll have a gimlet.

55:57.971 --> 55:58.836
very good, sir.

55:58.972 --> 56:01.011
be in touch.

56:01.141 --> 56:02.849
l told you to proof-read this.

56:02.976 --> 56:05.549
There are two spelling errors,
the columns are off,

56:05.687 --> 56:08.392
and the staple is vertical not horizontal.

56:08.523 --> 56:12.687
spencer barnes, Diane connors.

56:12.819 --> 56:15.690
- l've heard good things.
- right.

56:18.826 --> 56:22.076
l like your strategy.

56:22.204 --> 56:27.080
beating the owner of the company
in tennis. smart way to get attention.

56:27.209 --> 56:30.044
l was just trying to win.

56:30.171 --> 56:33.504
Exactly.
We're all trying to win.

56:34.425 --> 56:39.467
When l heard you beat sakamoto,
l knew l was gonna like you.

56:42.809 --> 56:45.347
mr sakamoto.

56:46.270 --> 56:47.813
Good Evening, ms connors.

56:49.274 --> 56:52.607
hey, big sak!
What's up, man?

56:54.112 --> 56:56.864
l've never had such
a competitive opponent.

56:56.990 --> 56:59.659
You play an unusual game of tennis.

56:59.784 --> 57:02.240
unusual, but effective.

57:02.370 --> 57:04.446
You're not so bad yourself.

57:04.581 --> 57:06.953
You gotta choke up on that racket.

57:07.083 --> 57:09.409
Let's get down to business, shall we?

57:11.254 --> 57:16.497
now bentley is in first place
to take over our national ad campaign.

57:16.635 --> 57:19.885
now, here's the deal, spencer.

57:20.013 --> 57:24.011
friday's close was at 56.
One of the most active stocks traded.

57:24.143 --> 57:25.139
smoke?

57:27.646 --> 57:30.351
l don't smoke,
but a couple of my friends do.

57:30.483 --> 57:33.056
mind if l take some?

57:33.194 --> 57:34.771
Thank you.

57:34.904 --> 57:36.980
my point is this:

57:37.114 --> 57:40.863
As well as we're doing,
we want to do better.

57:40.993 --> 57:44.362
The bottom line after all is... money.

57:46.332 --> 57:47.910
l'd like to propose a toast.

57:50.336 --> 57:55.045
To international business, good
commercial relations between all countries,

57:55.175 --> 57:58.341
and to the healthy future
of high quality foods

57:58.470 --> 58:02.681
thanks to sakamoto Enterprises and
to bentley Advertising!

58:02.807 --> 58:03.839
hear, hear!

58:04.976 --> 58:09.520
A toast to competitiveness,
good management,

58:09.648 --> 58:11.973
profit and honesty.

58:14.987 --> 58:17.110
- spencer, do a toast.
- sure.

58:18.449 --> 58:20.322
A toast...

58:22.244 --> 58:25.779
To the cubs winning the World series
and big tits.

58:34.674 --> 58:38.458
l'm sure you're familiar
with our last campaign.

58:39.720 --> 58:40.752
Yes...

58:41.389 --> 58:43.346
high quality Foods
The best there is

58:43.474 --> 58:45.467
l watch Tv all the time.

58:45.601 --> 58:49.730
We've been using that for years.
We are looking for a new image.

58:49.856 --> 58:53.272
And we love what bentley did
for kerry's cookies.

58:53.401 --> 58:55.690
honesty is the key to success.

58:55.820 --> 58:58.655
l want an honest campaign.

58:58.782 --> 59:00.905
honesty? That's good.

59:01.743 --> 59:04.614
Are you familiar
with high quality's products?

59:04.746 --> 59:06.490
l eat the stuff every day.

59:06.623 --> 59:08.829
- What is your opinion?
- honestly?

59:10.502 --> 59:12.958
l think your oatmeal sucks.
nobody likes it.

59:13.088 --> 59:16.124
lt tastes like dirt.
chewy dirt.

59:16.967 --> 59:19.256
Your bologna tastes like rubber.

59:19.386 --> 59:21.675
You have to smother it with mustard,
so you don't taste it.

59:21.805 --> 59:26.349
but not your mustard
'cause your mustard tastes like shit.

59:26.477 --> 59:30.475
Your frosted flakes have half the sugar
that Tony the Tiger's does.

59:30.606 --> 59:32.184
And your bread just rips apart.

59:32.316 --> 59:35.234
Just try spreading peanut butter
on it... right in your hands.

59:35.361 --> 59:37.484
not your peanut butter 'cause it sucks.

59:37.613 --> 59:40.567
l don't think this is a good idea.

59:40.700 --> 59:42.408
- he asked me.
- ms connors...

59:42.535 --> 59:44.693
what do you think about what he's saying?

59:44.829 --> 59:49.372
lt's outrageous. lf this is your idea
of a joke, l don't find it funny.

59:49.500 --> 59:51.540
no, l'm just being honest.

59:51.669 --> 59:55.833
- You've been honest enough.
- no, please. Go on.

59:55.965 --> 59:59.251
ls there anything
about high quality foods you like?

01:00:00.512 --> 01:00:05.090
Your potato chips are pretty good,
but then again l like greasy food.

01:00:06.435 --> 01:00:08.511
lt's not bad that you sell cheap stuff.

01:00:08.645 --> 01:00:11.599
not everybody can afford
a ¤3.00 box of fruit Loops.

01:00:11.732 --> 01:00:14.602
but you shouldn't call it
high quality foods, 'cause it isn't.

01:00:14.735 --> 01:00:19.397
big sak, if you want to be honest,
you should call it Low quality foods.

01:00:19.531 --> 01:00:21.820
but you don't want to do that...

01:00:22.534 --> 01:00:26.579
Why don't you try calling it
something like Affordable foods.

01:00:26.705 --> 01:00:29.659
Or change the ''best there is'' thing to,

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:33.540
''high quality food
because you can afford it.''

01:00:33.671 --> 01:00:37.087
Or make your food really great,
then you can say,

01:00:37.216 --> 01:00:41.510
''Eat this because everybody
deserves high quality foods.''

01:00:41.637 --> 01:00:45.053
how dare you insult our product.

01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:49.430
mr. sakamoto, l am so sorry.
This is ridiculous.

01:00:49.562 --> 01:00:52.053
l've never seen anything
so unprofessional.

01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:56.852
Well, maybe l'm just not good
at these kinds of meetings.

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:58.730
All right?

01:01:00.115 --> 01:01:02.522
l got a hot date.
l'm out of here.

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:04.738
nice tits.

01:01:07.873 --> 01:01:10.993
l'm out of here also.
nice chi-chi.

01:01:12.044 --> 01:01:14.167
l've got the nurses' station.

01:01:14.296 --> 01:01:17.380
Get me Walter bentley on the phone now!

01:01:37.945 --> 01:01:39.321
bmW.

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.115
mercedes.

01:01:43.659 --> 01:01:44.822
Jaguar.

01:01:46.746 --> 01:01:48.406
hey, chico!

01:01:49.332 --> 01:01:51.241
Take care of her.

01:01:56.423 --> 01:01:59.340
Yeah.
l'll take care of her.

01:01:59.467 --> 01:02:02.385
l haven't robbed anyone.
l've been robbed.

01:02:02.512 --> 01:02:04.719
Look at me.
Do you think l dress this way?

01:02:04.848 --> 01:02:06.971
- l'm an executive.
- 383.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:10.552
l'd sue for false arrest,
but l'd probably end up in the electric chair.

01:02:10.687 --> 01:02:12.146
One comb.

01:02:12.272 --> 01:02:14.977
- Listen, l need a ride.
- shoelaces.

01:02:15.108 --> 01:02:18.691
hello. Earth to Little Abner.
l need a ride.

01:02:18.821 --> 01:02:21.987
- We're not a taxi service.
- One piece of paper.

01:02:25.536 --> 01:02:27.659
Oh, God.

01:02:27.788 --> 01:02:30.789
God, Debbie, l'm so sorry.

01:02:30.916 --> 01:02:33.752
Don't be silly.
lt was good to hear your voice again.

01:02:33.878 --> 01:02:37.496
l got to cancel my credit cards,
l got to call high quality foods.

01:02:37.632 --> 01:02:41.546
l got to call Elizabeth.
l need to go back to Walter's in malibu.

01:02:41.677 --> 01:02:44.299
- please take me there.
- first, l'm making us dinner.

01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:46.637
no! l have to get back there right now.

01:02:46.766 --> 01:02:48.557
spencer!

01:02:52.105 --> 01:02:55.723
l am not moving until you say yes.

01:03:00.322 --> 01:03:02.279
Yes!

01:03:07.370 --> 01:03:11.700
so, then... mitch tells me he's married.

01:03:15.754 --> 01:03:18.459
Obviously, he was not the man for me.

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:20.382
no way.

01:03:20.509 --> 01:03:23.593
he thought he could control me.

01:03:23.721 --> 01:03:27.054
l felt like...
like l was in prison.

01:03:28.434 --> 01:03:31.269
- man, l know that feeling.
- Yeah?

01:03:31.395 --> 01:03:34.147
Trapped, lonely.

01:03:34.273 --> 01:03:36.598
frustrated. You're stuck inside.

01:03:36.734 --> 01:03:40.317
You don't know how you got there,
but you're there.

01:03:40.446 --> 01:03:41.775
Yeah.

01:03:41.906 --> 01:03:44.942
l was in a relationship like that recently.

01:03:45.076 --> 01:03:47.745
lt lasted about three years.

01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:51.785
controlled by one person,
who could be so cruel.

01:03:51.916 --> 01:03:53.494
Exactly!

01:03:53.626 --> 01:03:57.327
All you want to do is experience
the things you can't reach.

01:03:57.464 --> 01:04:02.292
Like a baseball game or a...
a dinner with a pretty girl.

01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:12.184
l'm... shy.

01:04:13.188 --> 01:04:16.806
- You wouldn't know it.
- somehow, l...

01:04:16.942 --> 01:04:19.018
l feel free.

01:04:19.153 --> 01:04:22.735
l feel... open.

01:04:25.284 --> 01:04:26.778
l feel sexy.

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:30.075
check!

01:04:30.206 --> 01:04:31.830
check, please.

01:04:31.957 --> 01:04:35.955
As we await the sixth and
possibly final game of the World series,

01:04:36.087 --> 01:04:39.919
unless authorities decide
to forcibly remove the inmates

01:04:40.049 --> 01:04:41.793
from their barricaded prison cells,

01:04:41.926 --> 01:04:45.260
tomorrow while you're sitting at home
watching the game...

01:04:45.388 --> 01:04:48.472
These pants fit before
my cauliflower and radish diet.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:51.269
- Thanks a lot.
- l was a fashion disaster.

01:04:51.394 --> 01:04:55.226
l'd lost 70 pounds.
Gained back 20, lost 1 0.

01:04:55.356 --> 01:04:59.271
l used to be on an avocado diet
before l found out they were fattening.

01:04:59.402 --> 01:05:04.111
Did you know that?
You see them in health food stores.

01:05:04.241 --> 01:05:09.235
You never think of them as bad for you,
but they're very fattening.

01:05:09.371 --> 01:05:12.574
Then l started working
as a beauty consultant.

01:05:16.336 --> 01:05:19.752
You're so tense.
Take a deep breath.

01:05:19.882 --> 01:05:22.207
come on, take a real deep breath.

01:05:22.343 --> 01:05:25.877
lsn't that good? feel better?

01:05:26.013 --> 01:05:28.884
lt's amazing what a little bit
of make-up can do.

01:05:29.016 --> 01:05:32.017
lt can make anybody look beautiful.

01:05:32.144 --> 01:05:34.635
Guess l'm a people person.

01:05:34.772 --> 01:05:36.100
lt's the oven.

01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:40.359
stay.

01:05:45.491 --> 01:05:48.825
Damn it, Elizabeth.
Where are you?

01:06:19.485 --> 01:06:22.688
l hope you don't feel uncomfortable,
my being Walter's daughter.

01:06:22.821 --> 01:06:28.112
no... no. no.

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:34.785
Good.

01:07:24.093 --> 01:07:25.468
What?

01:07:29.181 --> 01:07:31.221
Well...

01:07:31.350 --> 01:07:36.890
You're the first man l've gone out with
that hasn't tried to jump on me.

01:07:37.023 --> 01:07:38.980
l am?

01:07:58.003 --> 01:07:59.960
Where is everybody?

01:08:03.925 --> 01:08:07.626
A little burned but edible, l think.

01:08:11.558 --> 01:08:15.093
We can't put the phone down
for a minute, can we?

01:08:21.944 --> 01:08:23.901
- What?
- You should get that.

01:08:24.029 --> 01:08:25.903
lt could be my father.

01:08:26.031 --> 01:08:29.068
- Your father! Where?
- no, the phone.

01:08:31.412 --> 01:08:34.117
The phone.

01:08:34.247 --> 01:08:35.243
hello?

01:08:35.374 --> 01:08:37.118
hello, who's this?

01:08:37.251 --> 01:08:40.417
- Who do you want to speak to?
- spencer.

01:08:41.798 --> 01:08:43.624
- This is spencer.
- spencer who?

01:08:43.758 --> 01:08:44.956
Who am l speaking to?

01:08:46.386 --> 01:08:47.880
he's there.

01:08:48.011 --> 01:08:50.254
l need you to drive me to Walter's.

01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:53.805
- You'll feel better after you've eaten.
- he's there!

01:08:53.935 --> 01:08:58.395
but we were just starting
to get funky.

01:08:58.523 --> 01:09:01.560
- l need you to drive me right away.
- how about after dinner?

01:09:01.693 --> 01:09:05.643
- no, l've got to go immediately.
- Oh, spencer!

01:09:05.781 --> 01:09:09.564
You know, all you've done
since l met you is complain.

01:09:09.701 --> 01:09:13.117
l can't take it anymore.

01:09:13.247 --> 01:09:17.031
l've been your chauffeur and your cook.

01:09:17.167 --> 01:09:19.456
- And your shrink!
- Debbie, really...

01:09:19.586 --> 01:09:22.421
l don't know what's happened to you
since high school,

01:09:22.548 --> 01:09:26.462
but you've become
this selfish, materialistic creep.

01:09:26.594 --> 01:09:28.836
- l need a ride.
- Get out!

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:31.426
- What?
- Get out!

01:09:31.557 --> 01:09:35.425
l never want to see you again! Get out!

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:39.808
And after you've dry cleaned those pants,
l want them back!

01:09:39.941 --> 01:09:41.933
perma-press!

01:09:42.068 --> 01:09:44.274
Oh, my God.

01:09:51.077 --> 01:09:53.615
- lt's raining.
- Yeah.

01:09:55.373 --> 01:09:57.200
Well...

01:09:57.334 --> 01:10:00.500
- l guess...
- l had a fabulous time.

01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:03.464
best safe sex l've ever had.

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:07.041
l had a fabulous time too.
l haven't had that much fun...

01:10:07.177 --> 01:10:11.923
in two years, eleven months,
three weeks and five days.

01:10:15.394 --> 01:10:19.178
l would stay but l feel uncomfortable
sleeping in my dad's bed.

01:10:19.314 --> 01:10:21.022
l don't.

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:26.189
he's got so many pillows.

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:30.154
- Are you sure l can take your rolls?
- Yeah, it's just a loaner.

01:10:31.619 --> 01:10:34.288
l guess l better...

01:10:45.091 --> 01:10:46.716
Wait!

01:10:49.804 --> 01:10:54.347
You think you'd like to go to the
World series with me tomorrow, maybe?

01:10:54.476 --> 01:10:56.848
l'd love to!

01:10:56.978 --> 01:10:59.896
- You want to go?
- l'd love to go.

01:11:00.023 --> 01:11:01.932
That's great.

01:11:02.067 --> 01:11:04.356
l think...

01:11:04.486 --> 01:11:07.191
l think l'm getting wet.

01:11:07.322 --> 01:11:11.616
- You better go inside.
- l'll meet you here about 1 2:00?

01:11:11.743 --> 01:11:14.531
1 2:00. park it around here, all right?

01:11:14.663 --> 01:11:17.747
- You come here.
- Ok.

01:11:25.966 --> 01:11:27.626
Yeah!

01:12:01.503 --> 01:12:02.962
spencer?

01:12:05.882 --> 01:12:07.258
spencer!

01:12:07.384 --> 01:12:11.298
l'll kill you!

01:12:12.472 --> 01:12:16.305
What the hell's the matter with you?
l was doing you a favour.

01:12:16.435 --> 01:12:18.511
l busted my ass for you.

01:12:18.645 --> 01:12:21.267
- All because of this little thing.
- Give me that!

01:12:21.398 --> 01:12:24.399
Take it. Just give me my reward
and l'm out of here.

01:12:24.527 --> 01:12:28.476
reward? Are you crazy? l should
sue you for everything you've got!

01:12:28.614 --> 01:12:31.022
l'd like to see that.
l got nothing.

01:12:31.158 --> 01:12:32.439
Excuse me.

01:12:33.411 --> 01:12:37.658
- hello?
- hello, spencer? It's me, Ted.

01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:40.875
lt's for you.

01:12:41.002 --> 01:12:42.829
- hello?
- spencer?

01:12:42.962 --> 01:12:45.038
- Yes?
- It's Ted.

01:12:45.173 --> 01:12:46.715
hi, Ted.

01:12:46.841 --> 01:12:51.468
I'm sure it's no surprise to you but diane's
officially turned down your agency.

01:12:51.596 --> 01:12:54.597
- What?
- Mike and I are sorry it didn't work out.

01:12:54.724 --> 01:12:57.725
- We really liked you.
- Get me Diane!

01:12:57.852 --> 01:13:01.304
Well, after that meeting
she won't take your calls, ever.

01:13:01.439 --> 01:13:02.768
Damn it!

01:13:02.899 --> 01:13:05.022
You said you were me.

01:13:05.736 --> 01:13:08.571
You beat sakamoto at tennis.

01:13:08.697 --> 01:13:11.484
You blew it with Diane connors!

01:13:11.617 --> 01:13:15.566
- That chick's a witch.
- l'll kill you!

01:13:18.207 --> 01:13:20.413
You look like shit.

01:13:20.542 --> 01:13:21.823
That hurt.

01:13:21.961 --> 01:13:25.626
- l didn't lose your filofax, you did.
- l'll kill you!

01:13:28.968 --> 01:13:31.506
now just calm down.

01:13:33.431 --> 01:13:36.716
- You ruined my life.
- l've been looking after you.

01:13:36.851 --> 01:13:39.259
And you keep yelling at me.

01:13:39.395 --> 01:13:43.179
Just give me my World series tickets
back and l'm out of here.

01:13:43.316 --> 01:13:44.858
World series tickets?

01:13:44.984 --> 01:13:47.606
Yeah, they're in your book.

01:13:49.113 --> 01:13:51.272
Give me my tickets, man.

01:13:51.407 --> 01:13:54.159
- These are the tickets?
- Yes.

01:13:54.285 --> 01:13:56.527
- You must be a big baseball fan.
- l am.

01:13:56.663 --> 01:14:00.114
can't wait to go to the World series.
Listen to me.

01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:03.619
You're coming with me and telling
everyone who you are and who l am.

01:14:03.754 --> 01:14:05.663
l'd really like to help you out.

01:14:05.797 --> 01:14:09.629
l've got a date with this beautiful girl
l'm taking to the World series.

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.630
l don't think so!

01:14:13.555 --> 01:14:16.640
Don't bite the seat number.

01:14:18.852 --> 01:14:22.720
follow me.
l can taste the excitement.

01:14:22.856 --> 01:14:25.348
stop biting my tickets, all right?

01:14:25.484 --> 01:14:27.524
All right.

01:14:27.653 --> 01:14:31.521
This is a Lotus.
You know what this thing does?

01:14:31.657 --> 01:14:35.275
This thing goes 1 60 miles an hour.
Over that.

01:14:35.411 --> 01:14:37.487
This is a nice set of wheels.

01:14:37.622 --> 01:14:39.994
Great, no keys.

01:14:40.124 --> 01:14:42.283
Who needs keys?

01:14:55.056 --> 01:14:59.136
Where can l get a pair of pants like that?
They come in different colours?

01:14:59.269 --> 01:15:02.472
hope this doesn't take long.
can't miss the national anthem.

01:15:02.606 --> 01:15:04.016
shut up.

01:15:04.524 --> 01:15:05.935
second floor.

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:11.193
- Who are you, anyway?
- Fourth floor, fifth floor.

01:15:11.323 --> 01:15:13.861
- l'm a car thief.
- very funny.

01:15:13.992 --> 01:15:16.530
no, really. l'm an escaped convict.

01:15:16.662 --> 01:15:22.118
l broke out of prison to see the cubs
in the World series.

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:24.920
- l'm serious.
- shut up.

01:15:25.045 --> 01:15:27.085
Lovely.

01:15:27.214 --> 01:15:30.880
sakamoto will be here any moment.
no unsolicited comments...

01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:33.216
- Diane connors?
- That's her.

01:15:33.346 --> 01:15:35.469
- What are you doing here?
- Watch it, she bites.

01:15:35.598 --> 01:15:38.089
What the hell's going on?
Didn't you get the message

01:15:38.226 --> 01:15:40.977
that we are not interested
in you or your agency?

01:15:41.104 --> 01:15:43.476
Tell her who you are.

01:15:43.606 --> 01:15:45.813
l'm Jimmy.

01:15:45.942 --> 01:15:48.314
Walter bentley's on teleconference.

01:15:48.444 --> 01:15:52.941
put him through.
l'm curious to hear what he has to say.

01:15:53.074 --> 01:15:56.028
Good. l can explain everything.

01:15:58.330 --> 01:16:00.821
hello, Diane. You're looking good.

01:16:00.957 --> 01:16:04.457
Look, l want to apologise for...
spencer!

01:16:04.586 --> 01:16:06.495
Walter, thank God.

01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:10.213
What the hell are you doing there?
You look awful.

01:16:10.342 --> 01:16:13.925
Like a bum at a costume party.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:16:14.054 --> 01:16:15.383
Like he looks great.

01:16:15.514 --> 01:16:19.179
how the hell could you come up
with this honey nut bakery slogan?

01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:23.770
They've already printed the billboards.
''check out those buns.''

01:16:23.898 --> 01:16:25.475
What buns?

01:16:25.608 --> 01:16:28.525
- These buns!
- l like that.

01:16:28.652 --> 01:16:32.353
l don't think your corporate and
personal problems are our concern.

01:16:32.490 --> 01:16:36.025
You have screwed up
in every possible way.

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.830
Walter, it wasn't me.

01:16:38.955 --> 01:16:40.829
That's not spencer, Walter.

01:16:40.957 --> 01:16:43.246
l'm disappointed in you.

01:16:43.376 --> 01:16:44.621
What's happening?

01:16:44.752 --> 01:16:46.330
beats the hell out of me.

01:16:46.462 --> 01:16:50.045
lf you think that you are getting
that promotion, forget it.

01:16:50.175 --> 01:16:53.875
You failed... totally!

01:16:54.012 --> 01:17:00.181
hey, all he did was lose his book.
l'm the one that screwed up.

01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:02.137
- Who's this guy?
- l'm Jimmy.

01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:06.932
lt's true. All you do is talk.
push people around.

01:17:07.067 --> 01:17:09.523
You know what? lt really pisses us off.

01:17:09.653 --> 01:17:14.066
spencer, l want you back here in 1 2 hours.

01:17:14.199 --> 01:17:17.070
- This is a mistake.
- Listen to me.

01:17:17.202 --> 01:17:19.658
You're the mistake.

01:17:20.623 --> 01:17:23.540
l'm the mistake.

01:17:23.918 --> 01:17:26.919
ln the last two days,
l've been mugged.

01:17:27.046 --> 01:17:33.001
l've been thrown into garbage,
l've been put in jail, my wife has left me.

01:17:33.135 --> 01:17:36.718
All because of this account.
l've been obsessed.

01:17:36.848 --> 01:17:41.675
The same way l've been obsessed
with every account l've gotten for you.

01:17:41.811 --> 01:17:45.891
- All l do is work.
- Work! Weekends, holidays.

01:17:46.024 --> 01:17:49.227
When l'm not working...

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:54.900
l don't know who l am.
l don't know what to do or think.

01:17:56.993 --> 01:18:01.406
- l hate my life.
- lt stinks.

01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:05.584
l've made my wife miserable,
l've made myself miserable.

01:18:06.712 --> 01:18:11.539
l don't want to end up like you.
l really...

01:18:11.675 --> 01:18:14.795
l can't do this anymore.

01:18:14.928 --> 01:18:18.262
The hell with all of it. l quit.

01:18:21.310 --> 01:18:25.224
Yeah... me, too.

01:18:25.356 --> 01:18:28.725
l quit. l'll see you later sometime.

01:18:28.859 --> 01:18:32.193
big sak. Work on your game.

01:18:32.321 --> 01:18:34.812
Don't lose that broom, witch.

01:18:36.284 --> 01:18:37.944
l want to apologise...

01:18:38.077 --> 01:18:40.864
Your firm has exhibited
gross incompetency.

01:18:40.997 --> 01:18:44.662
l am taking you out of my filofax.

01:18:44.792 --> 01:18:46.037
Don't!

01:18:48.171 --> 01:18:52.251
mr. sakamoto.
bentley isn't the only agency.

01:18:52.384 --> 01:18:55.550
l never had a good feeling
about them anyway.

01:18:55.679 --> 01:18:59.012
- Get me the bellflower August agency.
- no need.

01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:01.466
unless you're looking for a job.

01:19:01.601 --> 01:19:04.389
l'm not looking...
What?

01:19:04.521 --> 01:19:09.860
l came to the united states not just
to approve a new ad campaign,

01:19:09.985 --> 01:19:13.188
but to see you in action.
l've had complaints.

01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:16.649
What exactly are you saying?

01:19:16.784 --> 01:19:21.659
What l'm saying exactly, ms connors,
is that you are unprofessional,

01:19:21.789 --> 01:19:26.367
rude, and clearly incapable
of running my company.

01:19:26.502 --> 01:19:30.452
And what l am saying
is that you are terminated.

01:19:30.589 --> 01:19:32.878
Yay!

01:19:35.469 --> 01:19:39.882
spencer, game time.

01:19:42.226 --> 01:19:43.886
spencer?

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.155
Yo, spencer.

01:19:57.868 --> 01:20:01.071
spencer, you forgot this.

01:20:01.204 --> 01:20:05.416
- You were great back there.
- Great! l have nothing.

01:20:05.959 --> 01:20:07.916
You have your book.

01:20:08.045 --> 01:20:10.500
shut up, leave me alone.

01:20:10.631 --> 01:20:12.837
Ah, baby, baby, baby,
with the shut up.

01:20:12.966 --> 01:20:16.501
lf it wasn't for me, you wouldn't
realise your life was so rotten.

01:20:21.642 --> 01:20:24.678
- You want to go to the game?
- no.

01:20:24.812 --> 01:20:27.517
come on, what are you going to do?

01:20:27.648 --> 01:20:30.222
You don't have to be at work tomorrow.

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:35.857
That's true.

01:20:36.783 --> 01:20:38.822
Wait, don't move.

01:20:41.037 --> 01:20:45.082
hey, come on. Let's kick some butt.

01:20:45.208 --> 01:20:48.577
- You can use a little fun.
- fun?

01:20:48.711 --> 01:20:53.089
- my life is over.
- no, it's not. lt's just beginning.

01:20:53.216 --> 01:20:54.545
cubbies.

01:20:54.676 --> 01:20:58.508
lt's the chicago cubs. Did you know
you and l are both from chicago?

01:20:58.638 --> 01:21:01.343
- now that's exciting.
- lt is exciting.

01:21:01.475 --> 01:21:04.678
lt's a statistic. lt's a coincidence.

01:21:04.811 --> 01:21:07.931
lt's a divine right that
you and l should be here together,

01:21:08.065 --> 01:21:09.808
while the cubs are in the World series.

01:21:09.942 --> 01:21:14.734
We have to be at the cubs.
They need us.

01:21:17.366 --> 01:21:21.150
One leg over the other.
come on and there we go!

01:21:21.287 --> 01:21:23.778
That easy. come on, let's go.

01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:29.200
You really are an escaped convict.

01:21:29.337 --> 01:21:32.670
Yes, sir. 37 counts of Grand Theft Auto.

01:21:33.466 --> 01:21:37.049
And you really did break out of prison
to go to the World series.

01:21:37.178 --> 01:21:39.669
Yeah.

01:21:39.806 --> 01:21:45.144
That's the dumbest thing
l've ever heard.

01:21:46.271 --> 01:21:48.263
You want to hear dumb?

01:21:48.398 --> 01:21:52.098
l'm about to break a date with the most
beautiful girl l've seen in 5 years.

01:21:52.944 --> 01:21:54.984
That's dumb, spencer barnes.

01:21:55.113 --> 01:21:58.363
lt's all because of you 'cause
we're going to the cubs game.

01:21:58.491 --> 01:22:03.652
ln the car. hot dogs, hamburgers,
cokes, popcorn.

01:22:03.789 --> 01:22:04.951
cotton candy.

01:22:05.082 --> 01:22:10.123
Get in there. All right.
spence, you tight ass.

01:22:10.254 --> 01:22:11.878
Way to go.

01:22:18.971 --> 01:22:21.723
- hello.
- Jewel, it's me.

01:22:21.849 --> 01:22:24.470
spencer! Where are you? Are you okay?

01:22:24.602 --> 01:22:28.469
Listen, l'm really sorry,
but l have to cancel our date.

01:22:28.606 --> 01:22:31.642
l need to spend some time with a friend.

01:22:31.776 --> 01:22:36.319
God, spencer.
You're so sensitive.

01:22:36.447 --> 01:22:39.117
What are you doing tonight?
Are you busy?

01:22:39.242 --> 01:22:43.405
l got some plans for tonight,
but l'm free tomorrow.

01:22:43.538 --> 01:22:45.115
Tomorrow's fine.

01:23:00.096 --> 01:23:01.591
ls spencer barnes here?

01:23:01.723 --> 01:23:05.258
no, l'm afraid he's not here right now.
can l help you?

01:23:05.394 --> 01:23:07.433
l'm not sure.

01:23:08.730 --> 01:23:09.893
You are?

01:23:10.023 --> 01:23:11.601
l'm his wife.

01:23:11.733 --> 01:23:13.525
his what?

01:23:13.652 --> 01:23:17.353
O'er the ramparts we watched

01:23:17.489 --> 01:23:21.155
Were so gallantly streaming

01:23:21.285 --> 01:23:25.532
And the rockets red glare

01:23:25.664 --> 01:23:29.199
The bombs bursting in air

01:23:29.335 --> 01:23:33.036
gave proof through the night

01:23:33.172 --> 01:23:37.550
That our flag was still there

01:23:37.677 --> 01:23:42.884
Oh, say does that star-spangled

01:23:43.016 --> 01:23:49.553
Banner yet wave

01:23:49.689 --> 01:23:56.653
O'er the land of the free

01:23:56.780 --> 01:24:04.526
And the home of the brave

01:24:06.873 --> 01:24:09.543
Go cubs! kick some ass!

01:24:09.668 --> 01:24:13.119
Let's go. here's your hat. Let's go!

01:24:18.844 --> 01:24:20.255
play ball!

01:24:20.387 --> 01:24:22.214
All right! play ball.

01:24:22.348 --> 01:24:25.432
Then he took me downtown.
We went to a blues club...

01:24:25.559 --> 01:24:27.766
- blues club?
- Then we came back here...

01:24:27.895 --> 01:24:29.804
spencer hates blues.

01:24:29.939 --> 01:24:33.723
What do you mean? We had...

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:37.988
The guy you're describing sounds like
a totally different person.

01:24:39.824 --> 01:24:41.947
To be honest,
you don't look like

01:24:42.076 --> 01:24:44.864
the kind of woman that would be married
to a man with a tattoo.

01:24:44.996 --> 01:24:46.823
A what?

01:24:51.461 --> 01:24:52.576
hello.

01:24:52.712 --> 01:24:54.290
hello, is spencer there?

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:57.258
no, spencer's not here.
Who is this?

01:24:57.384 --> 01:24:58.333
lt's Debbie.

01:24:58.468 --> 01:25:02.133
Let me have it. Who's Debbie? Debbie?

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:03.544
- t es?
- What do you want?

01:25:03.682 --> 01:25:10.135
Tell spencer l'm sorry about last night
and l shouldn't have kicked him out.

01:25:10.272 --> 01:25:12.063
Tell him he can keep the pants.

01:25:12.191 --> 01:25:14.314
- What?
- What?

01:25:15.361 --> 01:25:19.145
come on, get your World series
souvenirs here.

01:25:24.286 --> 01:25:27.572
here, got you a coke and a dog.

01:25:27.707 --> 01:25:31.918
- Thanks.
- man, l love this game.

01:25:32.044 --> 01:25:34.618
What's wrong with you?

01:25:34.755 --> 01:25:40.094
nothing. l screwed up with everything.
l never got what l wanted.

01:25:41.179 --> 01:25:43.385
What did you want?

01:25:45.934 --> 01:25:48.092
l don't know.
You know what you want?

01:25:49.896 --> 01:25:53.347
l want the cubs to win the World series!

01:25:53.483 --> 01:25:54.598
nice hit.

01:25:54.734 --> 01:25:58.353
You better leave now.
You don't want to get stuck in traffic.

01:26:03.577 --> 01:26:05.616
What happened with your wife?

01:26:05.746 --> 01:26:08.367
You get caught cheating?
You banging the babysitter?

01:26:08.498 --> 01:26:11.334
- We don't even have any kids.
- how come?

01:26:13.295 --> 01:26:17.245
l never thought there'd be enough time
to raise them right.

01:26:17.383 --> 01:26:20.052
You got plenty of time now.

01:26:25.099 --> 01:26:28.468
call her. Give me that.

01:26:28.602 --> 01:26:32.054
Go ahead, call her.
she probably misses you.

01:26:32.189 --> 01:26:35.855
my wife thinks l'm a single-minded,
obsessive jerk.

01:26:35.985 --> 01:26:38.310
You are a single-minded, obsessive jerk.

01:26:38.446 --> 01:26:42.574
- You don't have to be if you don't want to.
- You sure?

01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:44.942
no, l'm not sure.

01:26:45.078 --> 01:26:48.945
- That's my dad's phone.
- he's a scout. he's calling the bullpen.

01:27:22.449 --> 01:27:23.363
What a play!

01:27:23.492 --> 01:27:25.200
Did you see that?

01:27:32.501 --> 01:27:35.171
- Let's get that guy for an interview.
- Ok.

01:27:36.714 --> 01:27:39.751
l got it! Did you see that?

01:27:39.884 --> 01:27:42.968
l just reached out, l snagged it.
The home run ball.

01:27:43.096 --> 01:27:45.219
mark Grace and the cubs
in the World series.

01:27:45.348 --> 01:27:48.883
Did you see that spectacular catch?

01:27:49.018 --> 01:27:52.185
You didn't see it? Why?

01:27:52.314 --> 01:27:54.721
- l was on the phone.
- You should've seen it.

01:27:54.858 --> 01:27:58.606
l was reaching out there and grabbed it.
lt was the catch of the day.

01:27:58.737 --> 01:28:02.817
- You told me to call home.
- You could have waited, put them on hold.

01:28:02.949 --> 01:28:05.867
- lt was a great catch!
- Elizabeth wasn't there.

01:28:05.994 --> 01:28:10.573
she wasn't there?
she didn't see it either.

01:28:10.707 --> 01:28:13.911
Elizabeth is your wife?
she called for you yesterday.

01:28:14.044 --> 01:28:15.669
she called yesterday?

01:28:15.796 --> 01:28:19.710
- Did she say anything?
- she apologised for kicking him out.

01:28:19.842 --> 01:28:23.709
for kicking him out last night?
l was with him. That can't be right.

01:28:23.846 --> 01:28:26.882
- What's she talking about?
- This isn't getting easier.

01:28:27.016 --> 01:28:30.100
my God! Look, it's spencer.

01:28:30.227 --> 01:28:33.264
- That's not spencer.
- Of course it's spencer.

01:28:33.397 --> 01:28:35.805
What's he doing on television?

01:28:35.942 --> 01:28:39.192
That's not spencer. That's spencer.

01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:42.357
That? That's not spencer.

01:28:42.490 --> 01:28:44.862
- Where did he get that shirt?
- What?

01:28:44.993 --> 01:28:48.362
my Elizabeth called yesterday?
What did she say?

01:28:51.416 --> 01:28:54.121
- They must have seen me on Tv.
- What did she say?

01:28:56.213 --> 01:28:58.419
l gotta go. lt was fun being you.

01:28:58.548 --> 01:29:00.920
What did she say? Wait a minute!

01:29:01.051 --> 01:29:02.878
Excuse me.

01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:06.423
Wait a minute!

01:29:13.772 --> 01:29:17.473
What's happening?
Why are we doing this?

01:29:17.610 --> 01:29:20.813
The cops.
They must have seen me on Tv.

01:29:20.946 --> 01:29:24.778
- When were you on Tv?
- When l made that catch you missed.

01:29:26.577 --> 01:29:29.780
- The cops wouldn't shoot us, would they?
- l don't think so.

01:29:29.914 --> 01:29:33.781
You don't think so?
What did Elizabeth say?

01:29:33.918 --> 01:29:36.409
- l'm missing the game!
- What did she say?

01:29:36.546 --> 01:29:39.749
- What?
- shit! What are you following me for?

01:29:39.882 --> 01:29:42.718
lf we get busted,
you'll get in trouble. Leave!

01:29:42.844 --> 01:29:45.798
l can't get arrested running
with an escaped con, can l?

01:29:45.930 --> 01:29:48.006
maybe.

01:29:48.767 --> 01:29:51.139
he's not down there.
he's probably up the ramp.

01:29:51.269 --> 01:29:54.887
Did Elizabeth say
to tell me anything?

01:29:55.023 --> 01:29:58.059
- Where did she call from?
- l didn't talk to her.

01:29:58.193 --> 01:30:01.277
- You didn't talk to her?
- Don't pitch to him, walk him!

01:30:01.405 --> 01:30:03.314
he got a hit.
The Angels are going to score.

01:30:03.448 --> 01:30:05.821
- Who talked to her?
- Jewel talked to her.

01:30:05.951 --> 01:30:07.778
Walter's Jewel?

01:30:07.911 --> 01:30:10.616
she's one hot lady.
Last night we did it.

01:30:10.747 --> 01:30:12.123
come on.

01:30:12.249 --> 01:30:15.665
You mean l slept with Walter's daughter?

01:30:15.794 --> 01:30:18.914
how was l?

01:30:19.048 --> 01:30:21.669
You were great!

01:30:21.801 --> 01:30:24.374
l knew l could be great in bed.

01:30:25.596 --> 01:30:26.675
That's him!

01:30:26.806 --> 01:30:29.641
- Let's get out of here.
- Guys, stop!

01:30:29.767 --> 01:30:32.056
come back, damn it!

01:30:35.606 --> 01:30:38.394
You got a credit card?
Give it to me.

01:30:42.655 --> 01:30:44.447
sweet.

01:30:58.547 --> 01:31:01.038
Damn it.

01:31:01.174 --> 01:31:02.633
shit!

01:31:03.385 --> 01:31:07.050
l can't... l can't believe it.

01:31:08.223 --> 01:31:12.303
l can escape out of jail, but l can't
escape out of a damn ballpark.

01:31:14.021 --> 01:31:17.105
l guess l'll just go back to jail, that's all.

01:31:17.232 --> 01:31:19.521
l'll just go back.

01:31:28.536 --> 01:31:31.406
- We know you're in there!
- come on, unlock this door!

01:31:31.539 --> 01:31:34.208
come here and hold onto me
before l change my mind.

01:31:34.333 --> 01:31:36.955
Go ahead, change your mind.

01:31:37.086 --> 01:31:39.209
come on!

01:31:39.339 --> 01:31:41.082
l'm coming!

01:31:41.215 --> 01:31:45.509
l always got A's in gym,
but this could be ridiculous.

01:31:45.637 --> 01:31:48.922
- This is a mistake!
- Yes, it is!

01:31:55.814 --> 01:31:57.142
Yeah!

01:31:59.568 --> 01:32:01.810
That was different, spencer.

01:32:04.906 --> 01:32:08.276
- Are you all right?
- That was batman.

01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:13.904
We can still hear the game on the radio.
Let's get in the car.

01:32:15.584 --> 01:32:18.206
And it's strike three
and the Cubs have won it!

01:32:18.337 --> 01:32:21.753
The 1990 World Champions
are the Chicago Cubs.

01:32:21.882 --> 01:32:24.089
- They did it!
- They won!

01:32:24.218 --> 01:32:28.512
All I can say is holy cow, joe.
t ou're witness to history.

01:32:28.639 --> 01:32:32.304
For the first time since 1908,
the Cubs have won the World series.

01:32:32.435 --> 01:32:35.389
I repeat, the Cubs have won the World...

01:32:35.521 --> 01:32:37.763
Why are you turning it off?

01:32:37.899 --> 01:32:39.726
They won.

01:32:39.859 --> 01:32:41.733
lt's over.

01:32:43.446 --> 01:32:46.364
The weekend's over.

01:32:49.411 --> 01:32:51.368
Was it so bad being me?

01:32:51.496 --> 01:32:53.904
no.

01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:56.080
no, l liked it.

01:32:56.209 --> 01:32:59.080
Everybody listened to me.
They took me seriously.

01:33:00.505 --> 01:33:03.672
Jewel, too. she took me seriously.
l like her.

01:33:04.468 --> 01:33:08.216
she was nice.
Yeah, l dug her.

01:33:09.848 --> 01:33:12.849
l just wonder if she'll like me
as Jimmy Dworski.

01:33:17.982 --> 01:33:22.311
lf the cubs can win the World series,
anything's possible, right?

01:33:22.445 --> 01:33:26.394
All right. now l got to think
how to break back into prison.

01:33:26.532 --> 01:33:28.608
Why would you want to do that?

01:33:28.743 --> 01:33:33.156
l got to. l escaped, now l got to
break back in so l can be released.

01:33:33.790 --> 01:33:37.408
l found it. lt was in my filofax.

01:33:37.543 --> 01:33:40.295
They should be in their car by now.

01:33:43.007 --> 01:33:46.127
Let me ask you something.
how will you get back in prison

01:33:46.261 --> 01:33:48.799
with the photographers
and reporters there?

01:33:48.930 --> 01:33:52.014
l can't believe l never thought of that.

01:33:52.142 --> 01:33:54.099
Why didn't l think of that?

01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:57.011
hello?

01:33:57.147 --> 01:34:00.812
All right. Jewel and l want to know
what the hell is going on.

01:34:00.942 --> 01:34:02.271
Where are you?

01:34:02.402 --> 01:34:04.312
- l'm at Walter's.
- Where?

01:34:04.446 --> 01:34:06.735
Answer me. What is going on?

01:34:06.865 --> 01:34:09.356
l lost my filofax.

01:34:09.493 --> 01:34:10.524
You what?

01:34:10.661 --> 01:34:11.906
And l quit my job.

01:34:12.037 --> 01:34:14.077
- Are you serious?
- What?

01:34:14.206 --> 01:34:18.204
Elizabeth, l miss you so much.

01:34:18.335 --> 01:34:22.416
l have so many things to tell you.
The most important thing is...

01:34:22.548 --> 01:34:25.300
l love you.

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:29.179
l love you, too.

01:34:30.932 --> 01:34:34.881
Will you ask my spencer
if we're still on for tomorrow?

01:34:35.019 --> 01:34:38.969
Jewel wants to know if she
and the spencer who caught the ball

01:34:39.107 --> 01:34:40.850
are still on for tomorrow.

01:34:40.984 --> 01:34:44.933
Are you and Jewel on for tomorrow?

01:34:45.071 --> 01:34:47.443
l don't know.

01:34:47.574 --> 01:34:50.694
how am l going to break back into prison?

01:34:50.827 --> 01:34:52.903
Wait a minute.

01:34:53.038 --> 01:34:56.620
Oh, my God. Yes!
Yes, they are on for tomorrow.

01:34:56.750 --> 01:35:00.201
- Yes, you're on.
- We are? Great!

01:35:00.337 --> 01:35:02.246
how about we go to hawaii?

01:35:02.381 --> 01:35:04.954
We leave tonight.

01:35:05.092 --> 01:35:06.088
We will.

01:35:06.218 --> 01:35:09.302
Why, for the first time,
do l really believe you?

01:35:09.429 --> 01:35:12.633
because like my pal here says,
l got a lot of free time.

01:35:12.766 --> 01:35:15.933
my calendar is blank.
ln fact, l don't even have a calendar.

01:35:16.061 --> 01:35:19.561
We leave tonight. but first,
there's something l have to do.

01:35:23.486 --> 01:35:25.562
Debbie...

01:35:27.156 --> 01:35:28.271
l'm sorry.

01:35:28.407 --> 01:35:30.614
spencer...

01:35:32.370 --> 01:35:36.783
Oh, spencer.

01:35:36.916 --> 01:35:39.241
hi, there.

01:35:43.173 --> 01:35:45.130
Thank you.

01:35:50.555 --> 01:35:52.464
The warden's expecting us.

01:35:52.599 --> 01:35:56.893
Just pull over there in front of that guard.
l'll call the warden.

01:36:03.735 --> 01:36:05.693
father barnes.

01:36:08.407 --> 01:36:11.194
That's quite a car.

01:36:11.326 --> 01:36:14.696
lt was a very kind donation to the parish.

01:36:14.830 --> 01:36:16.953
A red Lotus.

01:36:17.583 --> 01:36:19.622
Do you pray, my son?

01:36:19.752 --> 01:36:23.417
- not as much as l should, father.
- l can see it in your face.

01:36:24.298 --> 01:36:26.006
What is your given name?

01:36:26.133 --> 01:36:29.134
captain Toolman.
l hope you can help us.

01:36:29.262 --> 01:36:32.097
- Well, l'm not alone.
- l understand.

01:36:32.223 --> 01:36:35.426
no, l mean l brought someone with me.

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:37.766
Jimmy Dworski's mother.

01:36:43.568 --> 01:36:46.735
mrs. Dworski, captain Toolman.

01:36:48.114 --> 01:36:52.942
l hope you can help me.
l'm so worried about my poor Jimmy.

01:36:53.078 --> 01:36:56.447
What are you going to do?

01:36:56.581 --> 01:36:59.701
We'll send for somebody.

01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:09.632
Where in the hell is Jimmy at?
can't keep this up all night.

01:37:09.762 --> 01:37:12.881
gentlemen, listen up.
This is the warden.

01:37:13.015 --> 01:37:16.466
We have a professional mediator
who'd like to talk to you.

01:37:16.602 --> 01:37:17.681
mediator?

01:37:17.811 --> 01:37:20.018
- he's with jimmy's mother.
- Jimmy's mother?

01:37:20.147 --> 01:37:21.262
bad news.

01:37:21.398 --> 01:37:24.981
All right, father. she's all yours.

01:37:25.569 --> 01:37:27.977
hello, prisoners.

01:37:28.114 --> 01:37:29.442
It's Father Barnes.

01:37:29.574 --> 01:37:31.981
I'm here with jimmy's mother.

01:37:32.118 --> 01:37:34.573
Mrs. dworski.

01:37:34.704 --> 01:37:38.571
This must end.
We want to come in and talk to you.

01:37:38.708 --> 01:37:43.287
no way. We're not letting anyone in.

01:37:43.421 --> 01:37:46.375
Especially a mother.

01:37:46.508 --> 01:37:51.964
If you let us in, the warden
will promise complete forgiveness.

01:37:52.097 --> 01:37:54.386
- no punishment.
- What?

01:37:57.727 --> 01:38:00.397
- better food.
- better food.

01:38:00.522 --> 01:38:01.553
better what?

01:38:01.690 --> 01:38:07.859
''cast ye loaves across the water,
and they will return to the shore.''

01:38:07.988 --> 01:38:10.396
And I promise you better food.

01:38:16.163 --> 01:38:19.366
What the hell.
maybe we should let them in.

01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:22.121
- What about Jimmy?
- We can't give up.

01:38:22.253 --> 01:38:24.292
Jimmy's a homie.

01:38:26.173 --> 01:38:30.717
Forget it. t'all try to come in here,
we'll kill him dead.

01:38:33.765 --> 01:38:35.971
help me!

01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:38.259
I don't want to die.

01:38:43.858 --> 01:38:48.188
help me, man! I'm scared!

01:38:48.321 --> 01:38:51.322
l say we use the tear gas
and flush them out of there.

01:38:55.745 --> 01:38:58.949
They say they have a colour Tv
for Lebradford brown.

01:38:59.082 --> 01:39:01.490
ls that part of the strategy?

01:39:01.626 --> 01:39:05.209
home shopping club.
l used your credit card.

01:39:05.339 --> 01:39:08.090
Yes, we did. We ordered that.

01:39:08.217 --> 01:39:10.672
- What now?
- The governor's mediators are here.

01:39:10.803 --> 01:39:15.050
how many mediators
do they think we need?

01:39:15.182 --> 01:39:16.297
shit!

01:39:22.648 --> 01:39:25.139
You have no idea...

01:39:25.276 --> 01:39:29.060
how much l understand
what you're going through.

01:39:29.196 --> 01:39:31.106
Look at her, man.

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:34.111
- she look like the missing link.
- l think she's kind of cute.

01:39:34.243 --> 01:39:37.447
- Yeah, you would.
- Forget it! no one's coming in.

01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:39.822
Warden Toolman,
we're from the governor's office.

01:39:39.958 --> 01:39:41.500
- Gentlemen.
- Agent Jackson.

01:39:41.626 --> 01:39:43.619
pay attention, boys.

01:39:43.753 --> 01:39:47.502
You were specifically instructed not
to make any promises to the inmates.

01:39:47.632 --> 01:39:50.550
We're interrupting the proceedings
and taking over.

01:39:50.677 --> 01:39:53.927
Let me in, goddamn it!

01:39:54.055 --> 01:39:56.178
What the hell is she doing?

01:39:56.308 --> 01:39:58.846
she's signalling.

01:39:58.977 --> 01:40:03.141
how does she know our signal?
she ain't no homie!

01:40:03.273 --> 01:40:07.141
- ''steal home?''
- ''lntentional walk?''

01:40:07.277 --> 01:40:08.558
''Go home?''

01:40:08.695 --> 01:40:10.190
Let me in!

01:40:10.322 --> 01:40:12.564
That ain't no missing link.

01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:14.609
That's Jimmy.

01:40:18.247 --> 01:40:20.204
father, what is she doing?

01:40:21.876 --> 01:40:26.917
she is doing a special prayer
that l taught her. Excuse me.

01:40:27.048 --> 01:40:29.455
- We're going to go in.
- no, look.

01:40:36.140 --> 01:40:40.886
Ok. They can come in,
but only the mother and the father.

01:40:44.399 --> 01:40:45.810
close it!

01:40:45.942 --> 01:40:48.694
Where's my Jimmy?

01:40:50.697 --> 01:40:54.196
right this way, mrs. Dworski.

01:40:54.326 --> 01:40:57.529
Did you see that catch l made?

01:41:03.543 --> 01:41:06.414
These heels are killing me.

01:41:06.547 --> 01:41:08.373
Damn it, what took you so long?

01:41:08.507 --> 01:41:11.176
l was at the hairdresser
or l'd been here earlier.

01:41:11.301 --> 01:41:14.884
- no hair jokes.
- This is for you, heavy G.

01:41:15.014 --> 01:41:19.058
Get me out of these clothes.
lt's so hard to be a woman.

01:41:20.352 --> 01:41:23.603
All right, shut up!

01:41:25.107 --> 01:41:27.515
l'm going to keep the nails.

01:41:29.862 --> 01:41:34.939
spencer, come here.
Guys, this is spencer barnes, my friend.

01:41:35.827 --> 01:41:40.156
Good work, you got us in.
That Debbie's a talented girl.

01:41:40.290 --> 01:41:44.916
she gave me her number.
she wanted to make sure you had it.

01:41:45.044 --> 01:41:47.618
- she's a nice lady.
- she's good, isn't she?

01:41:47.756 --> 01:41:51.089
You take care of yourself
and try to stay out of trouble.

01:41:51.217 --> 01:41:55.085
- really, man. And thanks.
- Look me up when you get out.

01:41:55.222 --> 01:41:58.092
Ok. l get out in about 20 minutes.

01:41:58.225 --> 01:42:00.894
ln that case, forget it.

01:42:02.771 --> 01:42:05.060
All right. here, like this.

01:42:08.527 --> 01:42:11.730
There you go, spencer barnes.

01:42:15.743 --> 01:42:18.494

01:42:18.621 --> 01:42:21.491
Warden, l never thought l'd get out.

01:42:21.624 --> 01:42:24.459
l didn't know l'd get out
of that horrible place.

01:42:24.585 --> 01:42:28.417
- l thought l'd be there forever.
- You're wearing lipstick.

01:42:28.548 --> 01:42:32.248
- my mom gave me a big kiss.
- Where is your mom?

01:42:32.385 --> 01:42:35.302
- l smell perfume.
- Don't be stupid, the press is watching.

01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:37.636
- Thank you, everybody.
- You're welcome.

01:42:37.765 --> 01:42:40.173
he's the greatest warden
a guy could have.

01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:42.136
Just my job, Jim.

01:42:42.270 --> 01:42:45.141
Will l still be released today?

01:42:45.273 --> 01:42:47.942
- Will l?
- Of course you'll be released today.

01:42:48.068 --> 01:42:50.393
Thank you!

01:42:51.488 --> 01:42:52.947
You're the best!

01:42:53.073 --> 01:42:56.940
All right. Don't do that again, please.

01:42:58.245 --> 01:43:01.329
- Get out of here, man.
- hope l never see you again.

01:43:01.456 --> 01:43:03.496
Take it easy.

01:43:09.381 --> 01:43:13.379
- What are you doing here?
- figured you'd need a ride.

01:43:17.932 --> 01:43:20.090
Thanks a lot, man.

01:43:22.686 --> 01:43:25.522
And l needed someone to start the car.

01:43:27.817 --> 01:43:29.608

01:43:39.329 --> 01:43:41.487

I want you both to come work for me.

01:43:56.012 --> 01:43:59.797
- You want to hire us both?
- t ou make a good team.

01:43:59.933 --> 01:44:02.685
how much did you have in mind?

01:44:02.811 --> 01:44:05.646
I was thinking 25 a month.

01:44:05.772 --> 01:44:07.350
Thousand?

01:44:07.483 --> 01:44:10.270
t ou'd head my American
advertising operation.

01:44:10.402 --> 01:44:13.107
- A month?
- Of course we're flattered.

01:44:13.238 --> 01:44:16.026
We'll need a little time
to think that over.

01:44:16.158 --> 01:44:19.658
- no time. l know. Take it.
- We'll get back to you shortly.

01:44:19.787 --> 01:44:24.116
- Take your time. t ou need a vacation.
- Thank you. bye.

01:44:25.001 --> 01:44:26.163
What, are you nuts?

01:44:26.294 --> 01:44:29.544
business lesson number one.
never take your first offer.

01:44:32.091 --> 01:44:36.670
Yeah, right. That's just like baseball.
Don't swing at your first pitch.

01:44:36.804 --> 01:44:39.130
Wait a second.

01:44:39.265 --> 01:44:42.930
Just one quick second.

01:44:53.864 --> 01:44:56.983
l don't know where the Tv came from...

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.408
Ok, partner. Let's go.
