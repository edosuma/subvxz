00:00.000 --> 00:01.710
- Previously, on "Nashville"...

00:01.710 --> 00:03.750
- Get on your knees.

00:03.750 --> 00:05.210
- (screams)

00:05.210 --> 00:06.830
- You can see there's no motion.

00:08.290 --> 00:09.960
- Do you need anything?

00:09.960 --> 00:12.500
- I just need to be alone.
- Come to Texas. You could

00:12.500 --> 00:14.710
play some shows with us
or just come along for the ride.

00:14.710 --> 00:17.080
- You're close with Rayna's
daughter, Maddie, aren't you?

00:17.080 --> 00:19.920
Got a song I think
will be great for her.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.380
- I'm happy to pass it along.

00:22.380 --> 00:24.790
She just doesn't think that
it's quite right for her.

00:24.790 --> 00:26.250
J said it didn't
light your fire?

00:26.250 --> 00:27.880
- How could you?

00:30.000 --> 00:31.620
(cell phone dinging)

00:31.620 --> 00:33.040
(click)

00:35.170 --> 00:37.000
- Hey, Maddie!
- Hmm?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.210
- Maddie! Maddie, wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

00:38.210 --> 00:40.170
Guess what?
- What?

00:40.170 --> 00:41.920
- You are nominated
for an American Music Award!

00:41.920 --> 00:43.420
- What?
- Yes.

00:43.420 --> 00:45.000
- No way.
You're kidding me?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.540
- Favorite Song.
Pop Rock, that's the category.

00:46.540 --> 00:48.040
- What?!
No way!

00:48.040 --> 00:49.500
- Yes way.
- No way!

00:49.500 --> 00:51.790
- Justin Bieber won
that last year, Maddie!!

00:51.790 --> 00:54.080
- Who else is nominated?
- Katy Perry!

00:54.080 --> 00:56.460
- No!
- Yes, and Juliette Barnes.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.040
- That's awesome.

01:00.040 --> 01:02.420
Oh my God.

01:05.170 --> 01:07.500
AVERY: This is amazing.
You're back on top.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.290
- Yeah, it's great.

01:09.290 --> 01:11.080
- Juliette, it's more than that.

01:11.080 --> 01:12.960
And less than a year ago,

01:12.960 --> 01:14.790
you--you were never
going to walk again.

01:14.790 --> 01:16.120
Is everything okay?

01:16.120 --> 01:17.880
- Everything's great.

01:17.880 --> 01:19.580
Stop digging for something
that isn't there.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.960
- Okay, okay.

01:21.960 --> 01:24.330
Give Cadence a kiss for me
and tell her I miss her,

01:24.330 --> 01:25.830
Bye.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.960
- That's awesome about Juliette.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.420
- Yeah, it is.

01:34.830 --> 01:37.960
How are you holding up?

01:37.960 --> 01:39.960
You going to visit
the old stomping grounds?

01:39.960 --> 01:41.580
- I don't know.

01:41.580 --> 01:43.580
It's a good three hours
from Austin.

01:43.580 --> 01:45.830
- I'm playing
back-to-back shows.

01:45.830 --> 01:48.670
You have time.
- Yeah, I guess.

01:48.670 --> 01:49.960
Just my Grandma's
the only person

01:49.960 --> 01:51.620
that still lives in Aurora.

01:51.620 --> 01:54.500
She's not exactly a renowned
conversationalist.

01:56.330 --> 01:58.080
- You know, still,
she's family, right?

01:58.080 --> 02:00.540
You should go.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.710
(text message rings)

02:15.380 --> 02:17.500
(cell phone ringing)

02:21.750 --> 02:23.580
- I'm surprised you
know how to do this.

02:23.580 --> 02:25.290
- Yeah, well, you learn a lot

02:25.290 --> 02:26.710
when you got two
teenage daughters.

02:26.710 --> 02:27.960
- I guess so.

02:27.960 --> 02:29.330
- You going to
sing me that song?

02:29.330 --> 02:32.330
- No, actually, my home studio

02:32.330 --> 02:34.790
currently consists
of this iPhone.

02:34.790 --> 02:36.750
And I listened back
and my vocals just sound

02:36.750 --> 02:39.420
like scratchy
and--and thin, so.

02:39.420 --> 02:40.830
- Why don't you just
play it for me now then?

02:40.830 --> 02:42.750
- Now?
- Yeah.

02:42.750 --> 02:44.540
- Are you serious?
- I'm very serious.

02:44.540 --> 02:46.290
I want to hear some music.
- Ugh.

02:46.290 --> 02:47.670
- Come on.
- Okay, you know what?

02:47.670 --> 02:49.170
I'm going to do it.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.620
But only because it was
my New Year's resolution

02:51.620 --> 02:53.920
to never pass up
an opportunity to play.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.040
Hold on.

02:58.210 --> 02:59.540
Okay, this is officially

02:59.540 --> 03:01.080
the strangest thing
I've ever done.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.670
- You need to get out more.

03:02.670 --> 03:05.210
- Ha-ha, very funny.

03:05.210 --> 03:07.830
All right.

04:42.210 --> 04:43.670
- Grandma?

04:46.460 --> 04:48.830
It's me.

04:48.830 --> 04:52.120
It's Gunnar.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.210
Sorry I didn't call ahead.

04:55.210 --> 04:57.380
I thought it might be best
to surprise you.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.210
- Umph.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.170
- Oh, Grandma, I don't--I don't
think you should be--

05:05.170 --> 05:08.920
- I'm passing real soon.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.460
- You have to take care
of yourself.

05:11.460 --> 05:14.210
- What damn difference
does it make?

05:27.250 --> 05:30.460
(cell phone rings)

05:33.670 --> 05:34.790
- Hey.
GUNNAR: Hey.

05:34.790 --> 05:37.330
I'm in a motel in Aurora.

05:37.330 --> 05:40.500
- Oh, um, what's it like
being home?

05:40.500 --> 05:42.880
- Yeah, it's kind of
depressing actually.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.580
You'd think after
a couple of years

05:44.580 --> 05:45.880
my Grandma and I'd have
something to talk about.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.960
She did raise me and my brother.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.250
- Well, maybe she just doesn't
know what to say.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.290
I mean, I imagine
being old is hard.

05:52.290 --> 05:55.000
- Yeah...

05:55.000 --> 05:56.040
Anyway, how are you doing?

05:56.040 --> 05:58.120
- Uh, I'm okay.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.040
- Is that it?

06:00.040 --> 06:02.290
- Um, well I...

06:02.290 --> 06:04.380
I can't really explain
without, like,

06:04.380 --> 06:08.040
you know, so I'm okay.
(kettle whistling)

06:08.040 --> 06:09.920
Uh, you know what,
can I call you back?

06:09.920 --> 06:11.080
I got to get something
off the stove.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.380
- Uh, yeah. Sure.

06:13.380 --> 06:15.210
- Thank you. Bye.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.500
(clattering)

06:57.000 --> 06:59.500
- (exhales)

07:07.420 --> 07:08.960
(thumping)

07:19.500 --> 07:20.620
- Hey!
- You still flying high?

07:20.620 --> 07:22.420
- Hey.
- Yes, this is so incredible.

07:22.420 --> 07:23.710
- Just in time for ice cream!

07:23.710 --> 07:24.790
- Oh, (laughing).

07:24.790 --> 07:26.540
- Hey!
- Hi, how are you?

07:26.540 --> 07:28.250
- Good. You going on a trip?

07:28.250 --> 07:31.170
- Uh, no, I just--it got
real quiet at my house

07:31.170 --> 07:32.540
and I thought,
what better time

07:32.540 --> 07:34.250
to come and visit
my favorite family?

07:34.250 --> 07:36.000
- Yay.
- We're glad you did.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.460
- Do you want to sleep
in my room?

07:37.460 --> 07:39.000
- I would love that.
- Well, I know you two

07:39.000 --> 07:40.960
are going to be up
all night talking,

07:40.960 --> 07:42.250
so why don't you
go ahead and get ready

07:42.250 --> 07:43.710
for bed right now?
- Okay.

07:43.710 --> 07:46.540
- Taking the ice cream with you?
- Yeah.

07:48.460 --> 07:50.670
- Oh my goodness.
- You okay?

07:50.670 --> 07:52.670
- Yeah, totally fine.

07:52.670 --> 07:54.620
Just freaked out or something.

07:54.620 --> 07:57.580
I must've slept in that house by
myself about a 1,000 times

07:57.580 --> 08:00.250
and then all of a sudden,
I felt real vulnerable in it.

08:00.250 --> 08:03.710
- Yeah. Well, first off,
here's some ice cream.

08:05.420 --> 08:07.170
Second of all, I think you need
to cut yourself a break.

08:07.170 --> 08:09.420
You've been through a whole lot
recently, all right.

08:09.420 --> 08:12.170
You had a gun pulled on you,
darling.

08:12.170 --> 08:13.500
As if that wasn't enough.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.120
- This is embarrassing,
that's all.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.670
I mean, I'm--I've been
on this planet,

08:16.670 --> 08:18.420
what, almost three decades?

08:18.420 --> 08:20.500
I need to be able to exist here,
by myself, and be just fine.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.290
And apparently
I can't do that, so.

08:22.290 --> 08:24.830
- Well, maybe you should try
taking a self-defense class.

08:24.830 --> 08:26.330
This girl at the studio
has been raving

08:26.330 --> 08:28.080
about this course she took.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.670
She says she used to
be afraid to, like,

08:29.670 --> 08:31.580
jog around her park after dark.

08:31.580 --> 08:34.420
And now she's like got this
whole new outlook on it.

08:34.420 --> 08:35.580
- Wow.

08:35.580 --> 08:37.000
- Look at you with the wisdom.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.620
- I don't know.

08:38.620 --> 08:40.250
Seems like something
all women should do.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.960
- This whole media narrative
about you and Maddie

08:44.960 --> 08:47.420
being in the middle of some sort
of catfight isn't going away.

08:47.420 --> 08:49.380
And the nomination's
only adding fuel to the fire.

08:49.380 --> 08:52.080
- Cream?
- Please.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.420
In the interest to putting
this thing to bed

08:53.420 --> 08:54.830
before people start, you know,

08:54.830 --> 08:56.500
picking sides
and making t-shirts,

08:56.500 --> 08:59.000
I'd be happy to help
facilitate a conversation

08:59.000 --> 09:00.710
between the two of you.

09:00.710 --> 09:02.460
And we can bring in Deacon
to act as kind of a third--

09:02.460 --> 09:05.290
- No, I do not need
help talking to Maddie.

09:05.290 --> 09:07.830
I've known the girl since
she was a tater tot.

09:07.830 --> 09:11.580
- Yeah, I--well,
look, sometimes...

09:11.580 --> 09:14.420
with a miscommunication
as delicate as this--

09:14.420 --> 09:15.670
- Glenn, I stole her song.

09:15.670 --> 09:17.620
You know it. I know it.
Let's just call a spade a spade.

09:17.620 --> 09:19.670
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

09:19.670 --> 09:22.000
Maddie already had a hit song
about a tidal wave.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.380
For all we know,
she'd have passed

09:23.380 --> 09:25.040
on a song about waters rising.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.960
I mean, how much water
can a person sing about?

09:27.960 --> 09:31.620
(cell phone chirps)
- I just made nice on Twitter.

09:31.620 --> 09:33.540
Maddie's a big girl now.

09:33.540 --> 09:36.420
We don't need couples counseling
to get through this.

09:36.420 --> 09:38.790
It's going to be fine.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.290
- Gunnar Scott.
(laughs)

09:47.290 --> 09:48.420
Get out!
Is that you?

09:48.420 --> 09:49.920
- Kelly Walker.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.920
- And you even remember me.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.250
What are you doing here?

09:54.250 --> 09:57.000
- I'm just, uh,
just visiting some family.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.670
What about you?

09:58.670 --> 10:00.540
- Uh, well, if you can
believe it, I live here.

10:00.540 --> 10:02.250
- Really?

10:02.250 --> 10:04.210
- Yeah, I moved back
from Dallas about a year ago.

10:04.210 --> 10:05.380
But what about you though?

10:05.380 --> 10:07.460
I mean, you're legit famous now.

10:07.460 --> 10:09.460
- I don't know about that.

10:09.460 --> 10:10.710
- Oh come on.
I mean, in this town,

10:10.710 --> 10:12.790
you might as well be Tim McGraw.

10:12.790 --> 10:14.420
- Yeah, I never really
felt that way growing up.

10:14.420 --> 10:16.040
- Well, that's because
everyone was too busy

10:16.040 --> 10:17.540
watching a bunch of meatheads
pulverize each other

10:17.540 --> 10:18.750
on the football field.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.460
- If I remember correctly,

10:20.460 --> 10:21.920
weren't you dating
one of those meatheads?

10:21.920 --> 10:26.120
- Oh yeah.
Yep, the meatiest of them all.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.120
The choices we make, right?

10:29.120 --> 10:30.920
- You know I--
I kept up with you.

10:30.920 --> 10:32.500
Almost drove to Austin one time

10:32.500 --> 10:34.040
when I heard you
were playing there.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.040
- Almost?

10:35.040 --> 10:36.330
- Yeah, well, stuff came up.

10:36.330 --> 10:38.380
It's a long story.

10:38.380 --> 10:39.790
Um, but anyways,

10:39.790 --> 10:41.540
how long you in town for?

10:41.540 --> 10:44.620
- Well, to be honest, I was--
I was just leaving.

10:44.620 --> 10:46.540
- Oh-no, really?

10:46.540 --> 10:49.170
I mean, we haven't had
the chance to properly catch up.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.960
- Well, um,
what are you doing now?

10:51.960 --> 10:54.670
- Well, I have to
get back to the office.

10:54.670 --> 10:58.080
But I'm free this evening.
That is if you can stay?

11:00.210 --> 11:02.380
- I guess my schedule's
flexible.

11:02.380 --> 11:04.250
- Okay. Awesome.

11:04.250 --> 11:05.920
Hey, did you hear
about East Aurora?

11:05.920 --> 11:07.830
- No, what?
- They're tearing it down.

11:07.830 --> 11:10.120
- (scoffs) Wow.
- Can you believe that?

11:10.120 --> 11:11.670
We should go there tonight.

11:11.670 --> 11:13.580
You know, pour one out
for our misspent youth.

11:13.580 --> 11:15.670
- Yeah.

11:15.670 --> 11:17.620
- Are you staying at the motel?
- Yeah.

11:17.620 --> 11:19.960
- Okay. Well, I'll come
find you later then.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.000
- Sounds good.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.120
- Bye.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.080
- (sighs)
Hey, so sorry I'm late.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.750
- Hey, not a problem.

11:32.750 --> 11:34.250
Well, if I recall,
aren't you the girl

11:34.250 --> 11:35.710
that says she's always early?

11:35.710 --> 11:37.380
-I really am, yeah.
Barring catastrophe.

11:37.380 --> 11:38.920
- Oh. What happened?

11:38.920 --> 11:41.170
- Nothing, I'm exaggerating.
- No, what?

11:41.170 --> 11:43.380
- I was planning this
weekend with my son

11:43.380 --> 11:45.210
and I normally just get a day.

11:45.210 --> 11:49.790
So my ex made it seem like this
grand gesture on his part,

11:49.790 --> 11:51.580
which also means he gets to
cancel it at the last minute.

11:51.580 --> 11:54.420
- Oh. That sucks.

11:54.420 --> 11:57.120
- It does.
But, you know, I'm used to it.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.790
Will? Thank you.

11:59.790 --> 12:00.790
- Did you just order coffee?

12:00.790 --> 12:03.420
- I did, I come here a lot.

12:03.420 --> 12:06.170
- All right, well, you want
to talk about this song?

12:06.170 --> 12:07.330
- Not really.
- No?

12:07.330 --> 12:08.330
- No. I'm embarrassed.

12:08.330 --> 12:10.210
- Don't be. Seriously.

12:10.210 --> 12:11.620
Where'd it come from?

12:11.620 --> 12:12.960
- Oh, gosh,
where does anything, right?

12:12.960 --> 12:14.750
- Come on now.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.960
- I guess, it's that,
when people see me

12:16.960 --> 12:20.040
they expect some
lily of the field.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.880
And I'm just not that.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.170
So I guess it's kind of a--
a warning, you know.

12:24.170 --> 12:25.880
"Stay away, broken inside."

12:28.170 --> 12:30.080
- That's interesting.
I just think the difference

12:30.080 --> 12:33.960
between what we are inside
and what we seem to be outside

12:33.960 --> 12:36.620
that, you know, it's universal,
it speaks to people.

12:36.620 --> 12:39.580
It spoke to me.
- Really?

12:39.580 --> 12:42.000
Even through a phone
and choppy internet connection?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.580
- It's a good song.
Bad sound can't kill it.

12:44.580 --> 12:47.540
- Well, thank you,
I appreciate that.

12:47.540 --> 12:50.420
- That being said,
I got a little studio time

12:50.420 --> 12:51.960
I'm supposed to use on Juliette

12:51.960 --> 12:53.250
but she's not available
until next week

12:53.250 --> 12:54.420
if you want to get in
and lay it down.

12:54.420 --> 12:55.920
- Nah, I couldn't.

12:55.920 --> 12:57.710
- No? Just going to go
with that cell phone.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.500
- (laughs)
No, that's not the plan.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.920
And you don't--
you don't have to do that.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.620
I've got it covered.

13:02.620 --> 13:04.500
An engineer friend of mine
is recording a band all week

13:04.500 --> 13:07.000
and he said that he
could squeeze me in.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
- If there's any way I can help
you do right by that song,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.080
you let me know?
- All right.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.330
Well, the song says "Thank you,"
and sends its regards.

13:13.330 --> 13:15.620
- (laughs)

13:15.620 --> 13:17.040
- Thank you.

13:18.080 --> 13:22.080
(cell phone ringing)

13:23.500 --> 13:24.710
- Hey, what's up?

13:24.710 --> 13:26.620
- Just returning
your call, sorry.

13:26.620 --> 13:27.790
I had a weird night last night.

13:27.790 --> 13:29.670
- Oh yeah, what happened?

13:29.670 --> 13:32.420
- It's silly, but what I think
was a family of raccoons

13:32.420 --> 13:34.500
have inspired me
to take self-defense classes

13:34.500 --> 13:37.080
which is very much not me.

13:37.080 --> 13:40.000
But whatever, um,
where are you?

13:40.000 --> 13:43.460
- Uh, in Aurora, actually.

13:43.460 --> 13:46.500
- Oh wow. I thought you would've
gotten out of there by now.

13:46.500 --> 13:49.250
- Me too, but...

13:49.250 --> 13:52.000
- What's wrong?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.670
- Nothing it's just, you know,

13:53.670 --> 13:55.620
I thought we were trying to give
each other some space?

13:55.620 --> 13:59.460
- Gotcha, um, well,
I'll talk to you later or not.

13:59.460 --> 14:04.210
- Hey, no.
I'm not saying never.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.790
It's just this is a little
confusing for me.

14:06.790 --> 14:08.500
- Okay...well,

14:08.500 --> 14:11.750
I will try not
to be confusing moving forward.

14:13.210 --> 14:15.710
- Scarlett.
- I'll see you.

14:30.330 --> 14:32.290
- Hey sweetie.
- Hey.

14:32.290 --> 14:34.330
- Your sister home?

14:34.330 --> 14:36.250
- Uh, no. She's at Louise's.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.880
- I knew that.
- Yep.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.880
Well I am starving,
you want something to eat?

14:41.880 --> 14:42.960
- You didn't eat
at your meeting?

14:42.960 --> 14:45.670
- No. I had coffee.

14:45.670 --> 14:47.920
That's what you do at meetings,
you drink coffee.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.120
- Right.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.790
- You know that Jessie,
she's just a colleague, right?

14:55.790 --> 14:57.460
- I thought you
weren't signing her?

14:57.460 --> 14:59.080
- I'm not.
I just mean like a colleague

14:59.080 --> 15:00.670
in the broader sense
of the word.

15:00.670 --> 15:05.380
Like the club
of sad song writers.

15:05.380 --> 15:07.790
- How do I apply?

15:07.790 --> 15:08.880
- Sorry to tell you,
you don't have to.

15:08.880 --> 15:11.330
You are already a member.

15:11.330 --> 15:13.330
Just like Scarlett,
Gunnar, Avery and--

15:13.330 --> 15:16.000
- Dad?
- What?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.750
- I love you.

15:18.750 --> 15:21.460
Regardless.

15:25.330 --> 15:27.170
So we should talk about
what we're going to eat.

15:27.170 --> 15:28.750
- Yeah. (laughing)

15:33.830 --> 15:38.290
- Well, we started 6th grade
here, 18 years ago.

15:38.290 --> 15:40.670
It's funny how we've
known each other for that long

15:40.670 --> 15:43.080
but never had a conversation
as real as this one.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.290
- Yeah, well, you were always
part of the cool crowd, so.

15:45.290 --> 15:47.080
- No, I wasn't.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.880
- You absolutely were.

15:49.880 --> 15:52.120
I mean, it's not like
you were mean or anything.

15:52.120 --> 15:56.040
But you just had this--
this force field around you.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.210
- (scoffs)

15:57.210 --> 15:59.830
- All right, come on, do me.

15:59.830 --> 16:03.170
- Um, honestly I just--

16:03.170 --> 16:05.330
I remember feeling bad for you.

16:05.330 --> 16:06.750
- Oh, great.

16:06.750 --> 16:08.500
- No, I just mean,

16:08.500 --> 16:11.620
when my mom told me
how you lost your parents.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.880
I remember wanting
to talk to you about it

16:13.880 --> 16:16.830
but not really knowing how.

16:16.830 --> 16:19.540
You never really
had a crowd, did you?

16:19.540 --> 16:22.120
- Uh, I mean, I had my brother,

16:22.120 --> 16:24.080
until he kind of
went off the rails.

16:24.080 --> 16:27.380
But, uh...nope.

16:27.380 --> 16:30.210
- You always did have
some girlfriend though.

16:30.210 --> 16:31.460
- That's--that's not true.

16:31.460 --> 16:33.960
- Uh yeah,
since 9th grade, it was.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.380
You always had some girl

16:35.380 --> 16:37.330
who was sweet enough
but kind of plain.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.460
And you'd be
inseparable from her.

16:38.460 --> 16:40.380
- Yeah, well, not everybody

16:40.380 --> 16:41.580
could be with the prettiest
girl in Aurora.

16:41.580 --> 16:43.210
- Oh, just in the town?

16:43.210 --> 16:44.670
Not the whole county?

16:47.040 --> 16:48.880
- I mean, wasn't it obvious?

16:48.880 --> 16:51.580
- Wasn't what obvious?

16:51.580 --> 16:54.500
- That I liked you.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.040
- I mean, I had a hunch

16:57.040 --> 16:58.880
but you never asked me out.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.580
So I couldn't be sure.

17:02.750 --> 17:06.500
- Well, what are you
doing these days?

17:06.500 --> 17:10.460
- I...am breaking
into this school.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.540
- What?
- You want to join?

17:14.540 --> 17:16.580
- Uh, all right.

17:22.380 --> 17:24.710
- So, when I attack from behind,

17:24.710 --> 17:26.880
you grab the wrist,
strike the elbow to the face.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.170
If that fails,
good, turn around.

17:29.170 --> 17:31.580
Hit me with your knee.
Good, good.

17:31.580 --> 17:33.170
Now everybody.

17:42.250 --> 17:44.210
Try it with me.
Try it with me.

17:51.080 --> 17:52.420
- Um...

17:55.500 --> 17:57.830
- You're doing the motions,
but there's no aggression.

17:57.830 --> 18:01.670
- I guess I'm more interested
in the getting away part

18:01.670 --> 18:03.250
than hurting other people part.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.460
- And what if
there's no escaping?

18:04.460 --> 18:05.710
What are you doing then?

18:05.710 --> 18:07.830
Laying down
and hoping for the best?

18:07.830 --> 18:11.750
You must react in the instant
with overwhelming force.

18:11.750 --> 18:13.960
- Why not just enough
to get away?

18:13.960 --> 18:16.710
- Because, you must fight,
you must win.

18:16.710 --> 18:18.580
You strike first
and you do not stop

18:18.580 --> 18:21.880
until the person is
on the ground or unconscious.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.580
Try it. Hit me
with your knee when I attack.

18:27.120 --> 18:30.380
You want to learn self-defense,
but you still want to be nice.

18:30.380 --> 18:33.920
If you are defending yourself,
you're already past nice.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.460
- Yeah.

18:36.460 --> 18:38.170
You--you want to pick
on somebody else now?

18:38.170 --> 18:40.120
I--I got your point.

18:41.670 --> 18:44.830
- Okay, and what if
you're on the ground?

18:44.830 --> 18:46.290
- Why are they tearing
it down anyway?

18:46.290 --> 18:50.290
- Mm, it had, like,
off the charts levels

18:50.290 --> 18:53.420
of lead and mold
and other carcinogens.

18:53.420 --> 18:56.290
- Oh, suddenly
I feel light headed.

18:56.290 --> 18:57.580
- (laughs) Okay, okay.

18:57.580 --> 18:59.170
You're better off worrying

18:59.170 --> 19:01.920
about the seven years of
exposure you already got.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.710
- Yeah.
- Uh, hang on, I'm going to pee.

19:23.250 --> 19:26.790
- Come on, Gunnar.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.670
We just went through
this on Thursday.

19:28.670 --> 19:32.540
What do we do?
We combine like terms.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.960
After that, your job
is to isolate "X"

19:41.380 --> 19:44.960
Uh, Gunnar, you need to report
to the principal's office.

19:51.120 --> 19:52.580
- Beyond awful, boys.

19:52.580 --> 19:56.120
I'm so sorry to have to
give you this news.

20:04.710 --> 20:09.170
- Gunnar?
- Yeah, uh, in here!

20:11.620 --> 20:13.710
- Okay, super weird.

20:13.710 --> 20:15.580
I swear I just felt
my 7th grade braces

20:15.580 --> 20:17.170
brush against my gums
when I was in the girls room.

20:17.170 --> 20:20.750
- (chuckles) Crazy.

20:30.380 --> 20:32.210
- So...

20:32.210 --> 20:35.580
I have work in the morning
but can I see you tomorrow?

20:35.580 --> 20:37.920
- Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

20:37.920 --> 20:40.580
- Excellent, more trips
down memory lane to come.

20:47.620 --> 20:50.380

20:50.380 --> 20:53.380

20:55.670 --> 20:58.460

- Mm-hmm.

20:58.460 --> 20:59.880
(music continues in background)

20:59.880 --> 21:01.120
- Where were you thinking
of taking them?

21:01.120 --> 21:03.170
- Oh, the Great Smoky Mountains.

21:03.170 --> 21:05.040
- Oh.
- Which would've been a hoot.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.540
- Why is that?

21:06.540 --> 21:09.040
- Oh, because I haven't
pitched a tent since...

21:09.040 --> 21:11.540
I don't know,
Girl Scouts, maybe.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.000
But Jake has ADHD

21:15.000 --> 21:17.620
and something about nature
just agrees with him.

21:17.620 --> 21:19.500
Sort of slows him down.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.460
- It does the same thing for me.

21:26.540 --> 21:28.250

and go again from the top?
- Sure thing.

21:31.580 --> 21:33.040
- Doesn't sound like they're
going to be done any time soon.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.210
- Nope.
- I'm sorry Jessie.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.290
You ask me,
they already got it.

21:36.290 --> 21:37.500
But, it's their record.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.080
- Sam, don't apologize.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.710
You're the one that's
doing me a favor.

21:40.710 --> 21:42.920
I'm happy to wait, really.

21:42.920 --> 21:45.290
- Be back in a sec.

21:45.290 --> 21:47.040
- I'm not happy making you wait.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.420
- You're not making me wait.

21:48.420 --> 21:50.670
- I know but I just
feel uncomfortable

21:50.670 --> 21:52.420
making you sit around all day.

21:52.420 --> 21:55.250
Which is why I said I had it
covered in the first place.

21:55.250 --> 21:56.580
- Well, all right.

21:56.580 --> 21:58.710
I got some stuff
I need to do anyway.

21:58.710 --> 22:00.330
So I'll head on out.
- All right.

22:00.330 --> 22:01.710
- You let me know
how it goes, okay?

22:01.710 --> 22:03.580
- All right.

22:03.580 --> 22:05.710
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

22:07.750 --> 22:09.540
- Hey there.
How you doing?

22:09.540 --> 22:11.120
- Hey, what are you doing here?

22:11.120 --> 22:13.710
- Meeting with Alyssa,

22:13.710 --> 22:15.120
about what's happening next

22:15.120 --> 22:17.580
since The Exes are
on break or something.

22:17.580 --> 22:18.830
- Ya'll all come up
with anything?

22:18.830 --> 22:20.790
- Well, I'm--I'm writing.

22:20.790 --> 22:23.830
And, uh, I really
want to stay involved

22:23.830 --> 22:25.790
with the women's clinic.

22:25.790 --> 22:28.710
- You know it means
even more now after the...

22:28.710 --> 22:30.290
Sorry.

22:30.290 --> 22:33.960
- Oh, no, come on.
Come on, it's all right.

22:33.960 --> 22:36.170
- I cry eight times a day

22:36.170 --> 22:37.670
and I'm never going
to get over what happened.

22:37.670 --> 22:39.790
- Who says you should?

22:39.790 --> 22:42.790
You lost a baby, Scarlett.

22:42.790 --> 22:45.210
And a version of your future
that you'd fallen in love with.

22:45.210 --> 22:46.880
- Yeah.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.120
- You cry all you want.

22:52.330 --> 22:54.330
- You sit down, all right?
- Okay.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.670
- How's everything else,
otherwise?

22:59.670 --> 23:03.080
- Oh, I miss Gunnar
more than I thought I would.

23:03.080 --> 23:04.960
And I'm a failure
at self-defense.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.460
And I feel like a wimp
for coming to stay

23:06.460 --> 23:07.960
with you and the girls.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.000
- Come on now.
Would you cut yourself a break?

23:10.000 --> 23:12.080
- Just trying to do
everything alone.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.580
And be on my own.
And be okay.

23:13.580 --> 23:15.210
And so far, I'm just
screwing it all up.

23:15.210 --> 23:16.960
- What is this obsession
everybody has

23:16.960 --> 23:18.830
with doing everything
all by themselves?

23:18.830 --> 23:21.080
- What?
- Half a year ago,

23:21.080 --> 23:24.330
I could barely
put my own boots on.

23:24.330 --> 23:26.290
And more than a few people,
you most of all,

23:26.290 --> 23:28.710
stepped in,
in big ways.

23:28.710 --> 23:31.210
- That's different.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.830
- Not really.

23:33.830 --> 23:36.120
Sweetie, the opposite
of being with someone

23:36.120 --> 23:39.040
isn't doing
everything all alone.

23:39.040 --> 23:41.460
It's getting a lot
of different kinds of help

23:41.460 --> 23:44.580
from a lot of different people.

23:44.580 --> 23:46.000
- Never thought of it that way.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.830
- Yeah, well, neither did I.
It just...

23:48.830 --> 23:50.080
sounded good
so I went with it.

23:52.290 --> 23:53.920
- I appreciate it.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.830
- Hey, you know,
that's a really nice rug there.

24:00.830 --> 24:02.620
You know, it looks
really expensive.

24:02.620 --> 24:05.290
- You can't just
walk in here, Brad.

24:05.290 --> 24:07.170
- Where's Jake?
We're supposed to have dinner.

24:07.170 --> 24:08.500
Jake!

24:08.500 --> 24:11.080
- Told you,
I was dropping him off!!

24:11.080 --> 24:13.830
- Well, you know,
I was in the neighborhood.

24:13.830 --> 24:17.540
Thought I'd pop in and surprise
my two favorite people.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.120
- And how was I
supposed to know that?

24:19.120 --> 24:20.830
- Well, you weren't.

24:20.830 --> 24:23.000
You see, that's the definition
of a surprise--Jake!

24:23.000 --> 24:25.380
- He wants to stay at his
friend Kevin's tonight!

24:25.380 --> 24:27.420
- And you were going to let him?

24:27.420 --> 24:30.620
- Well, I was going to call you.
- When? Tomorrow?

24:30.620 --> 24:33.000
- Oh, come on,
he's 13 for heaven's sake.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.540
- Yeah, that's right,
he's 13 years old.

24:34.540 --> 24:36.420
And he knows the rules.
- Oh, here we go.

24:36.420 --> 24:39.040
- You have got to stop
enabling him, Jess!

24:39.040 --> 24:40.460
- And you've got
to stop treating him

24:40.460 --> 24:42.250
like he is in military school!

24:42.250 --> 24:43.620
- I am trying to
give him a future.

24:46.330 --> 24:50.460
- And what is it that you
think I am trying to do?

24:50.460 --> 24:53.460
- Oh man, I have
absolutely no idea--I don't.

24:53.460 --> 24:55.080
Unless it's to render him
as weak and helpless

24:55.080 --> 24:57.250
as you possibly can.

24:57.250 --> 24:58.920
- You need to leave.

25:02.540 --> 25:05.960
- So what, you going to
bring him over then or what?

25:05.960 --> 25:07.750
- You're really not going
to let him stay at Kevin's?

25:07.750 --> 25:09.290
- I expect him at 5:00 p.m.

25:09.290 --> 25:11.250
as per our court mandated
agreement!

25:14.330 --> 25:16.750
- He'll be there.
- Good girl.

25:16.750 --> 25:18.790
- Now get out.

25:24.080 --> 25:27.210
(cell phone ringing)

25:27.210 --> 25:29.170
- Hey, man.

25:29.170 --> 25:32.920
- Hey. Hadn't heard from you.
So I thought I'd check in.

25:32.920 --> 25:34.960
How are things going?
What are you up to today?

25:39.210 --> 25:41.080
- I'm sitting here
outside my old house.

25:41.080 --> 25:44.080
And it looks exactly the same.

25:44.080 --> 25:46.710
Except there's another
family living in it.

25:46.710 --> 25:49.120
- Well, you should
introduce yourself.

25:49.120 --> 25:51.040
Bet they'd invite you in.

26:05.790 --> 26:07.500
- Hello?

26:07.500 --> 26:09.420
- Hi, uh, my name's Gunnar.

26:09.420 --> 26:10.540
Um, Gunnar Scott, I--

26:10.540 --> 26:12.880
- We don't want to buy anything.

26:12.880 --> 26:14.920
- Oh, no, no-no.

26:14.920 --> 26:16.500
Um, I used to live here
when I was younger.

26:16.500 --> 26:20.540
I--I just came by because
I wanted to see it.

26:20.540 --> 26:22.670
But, uh, it's--it's okay.
Uh, I'm sorry to bother you.

26:22.670 --> 26:26.750
(Speaking Spanish)

26:28.330 --> 26:30.460
- I really did live here.

26:30.460 --> 26:33.710
Um, there's a little black stove
in the kitchen that burns wood.

26:37.080 --> 26:39.290
- Come in.
Come in.

26:39.290 --> 26:40.540
- Thank you.

26:41.580 --> 26:43.170
- I can give you a tour.

26:43.170 --> 26:45.040
- Oh yeah, thanks.

26:45.040 --> 26:47.040
- This is the living room.

26:48.420 --> 26:51.380
And this is the kitchen.

26:51.380 --> 26:53.540
And over there is the room
I share with my brother.

26:56.380 --> 26:58.040
- I used to share it
with my brother too.

26:58.040 --> 26:59.620
- Do you want to see it?

26:59.620 --> 27:01.380
- Is that okay?
- Of course.

27:01.380 --> 27:03.790
I sleep on the top bunk.

27:05.620 --> 27:10.080
(phone ringing)
MOM: Marisol, come.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.120

Please.

28:03.040 --> 28:04.170
You'll get in trouble.

28:04.170 --> 28:05.670

Mister?

28:19.790 --> 28:22.460
Are you done looking
at the room?

28:22.460 --> 28:24.460

- Hey.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.330
- You okay?
- Yeah, why?

28:35.330 --> 28:37.210
- Uh, I just didn't think
I'd hear from you

28:37.210 --> 28:40.290
unless something bad happened
or there was an emergency.

28:40.290 --> 28:42.000
So I--I got worried.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.460
- Oh, yeah, uh, no,
no emergency.

28:43.460 --> 28:47.080
- Good, um, uh, what's up?

28:47.080 --> 28:50.750
- Oh nothing, just being home
is really weird.

28:50.750 --> 28:52.960
Kind of tough.

28:52.960 --> 28:55.040
- Like how?
- Uh...

29:00.880 --> 29:02.330
Look, I--I'm sorry,
I know I called you

29:02.330 --> 29:03.620
but I--I should
probably just go.

29:03.620 --> 29:05.620
- You sure?
Because I'm here.

29:05.620 --> 29:08.080
- Yeah...yeah,
Sorry to bother you.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.620
- You--you're not a bother.

29:09.620 --> 29:11.960
- All right, thanks.

29:20.460 --> 29:21.620
- Hey.

29:21.620 --> 29:23.290
- Hey yourself.
How'd it go?

29:23.290 --> 29:25.250
- Uh, okay.

29:25.250 --> 29:27.380
- What does that mean?

29:27.380 --> 29:29.500
- Sam said that he was going to
make time for me next week.

29:29.500 --> 29:32.670
That's why I didn't call.

29:32.670 --> 29:34.040
- What are you doing at five?

29:34.040 --> 29:36.210
- Not sure.

29:36.210 --> 29:38.670
Why, what's up?
- Meet me at Tracks studio.

29:38.670 --> 29:41.120
Come on Jessie, it's just
sitting there empty.

29:41.120 --> 29:44.290
- Um, really?
You sure?

29:44.290 --> 29:46.080
- I consider that a yes.
I'll see you there.

29:48.500 --> 29:50.540
- Okay. Thank you.

30:20.290 --> 30:22.420
- It's like she's
conveniently forgotten

30:22.420 --> 30:24.830
all the things
that I've done for her.

30:24.830 --> 30:26.670
- Maybe she's just
saying thanks.

30:26.670 --> 30:28.330
- No, she is calling me a thief.

30:28.330 --> 30:32.040
She's just not saying it
outright...yet.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.960
- Well, why do you think
she hasn't said anything?

30:33.960 --> 30:35.710
- I don't know.

30:35.710 --> 30:37.830
Maybe she's trying to draw
it out, prolong the pain.

30:37.830 --> 30:39.330
- Or...

30:39.330 --> 30:41.790
- Maybe she's trying
to protect you.

Uh, let's just do
a couple in a row.

31:14.790 --> 31:16.330
- I'm not really feeling it.

31:16.330 --> 31:19.120
- Uh...okay, um,
what's wrong?

31:19.120 --> 31:21.830
- Mm...

31:21.830 --> 31:24.040
- Just a quick minute.
Thanks.

31:27.790 --> 31:29.620
- You know,
it's been a long day.

31:29.620 --> 31:32.040
And I just feel like I'm not
going to get it right now.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.920
- We got all the time
you need, Jess.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.620
And I mean, seriously,
right now,

31:36.620 --> 31:40.620
it feels like the only thing
in your way is...yourself.

31:42.080 --> 31:43.120
- So that's what you think?

31:43.120 --> 31:44.540
- It's not an insult.

31:44.540 --> 31:46.210
I'm just saying it can be scary

31:46.210 --> 31:48.210
when all the obstacles
to being here are cleared away

31:48.210 --> 31:49.620
and you're just standing there

31:49.620 --> 31:50.670
in front of that microphone
by yourself.

31:50.670 --> 31:52.080
I know, I've been there.

31:54.540 --> 31:55.920
Or we can come back tomorrow
if you'd like,

31:55.920 --> 31:58.790
- Yeah, cool, okay,
let's do that.

31:58.790 --> 32:00.250
- Uh-huh.
- Thanks.

32:06.790 --> 32:09.880
- Oh, my favorite student.

32:09.880 --> 32:11.080
- Don't get too attached.

32:11.080 --> 32:14.000
I think this is my last class.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.790
- Tell me, why are you here?

32:18.120 --> 32:20.580
- Um...

32:20.580 --> 32:23.620
me and my friend
were assaulted.

32:25.290 --> 32:27.460
- And what did you do?

32:27.460 --> 32:29.290
- Nothing.

32:29.290 --> 32:32.960
- What did you want to do?

32:32.960 --> 32:34.880
- I don't know.

32:34.880 --> 32:36.420
- You wanted to
do something, no?

32:38.500 --> 32:40.330
Come.

32:40.330 --> 32:42.830
Okay!
Class in session!

32:44.210 --> 32:47.040
(grunting)

32:47.040 --> 32:49.670
Good, good.
Next.

32:51.540 --> 32:53.250
Good, next.

33:01.790 --> 33:03.960
- (yelling)
- Yes!

33:03.960 --> 33:05.540
Yes! Yes!

33:07.920 --> 33:11.960
Yes! Yes!
That's how it's done!

33:11.960 --> 33:13.580
I'm tell you, people,
don't mess with this woman!

33:13.580 --> 33:15.000
She's stronger than she looks!

33:21.120 --> 33:23.380
(knocking on door)

33:23.380 --> 33:25.960
- Gunnar? You there?

33:29.960 --> 33:32.500
So, what kind of trouble
should we get into tonight?

33:32.500 --> 33:34.000
- I don't know.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.540
Um, honestly,
I--I'm kind of wiped, so.

33:37.540 --> 33:40.460
- Oh, okay.

33:40.460 --> 33:42.080
Um, you going to invite me in?

33:42.080 --> 33:44.460
Or shall we just keep hanging
out here in the doorway?

33:50.250 --> 33:52.460
You want to talk about it?

33:52.460 --> 33:53.580
- About what?

33:53.580 --> 33:56.210
- Whatever's on your mind.

33:59.750 --> 34:03.000
- Tell me something,
did I seem happy growing up?

34:03.000 --> 34:05.830
- Um...sometimes.

34:05.830 --> 34:08.000
I don't know.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.420
- I always thought I was
a pretty happy kid, you know.

34:10.420 --> 34:11.670
Sure some bad stuff happened.

34:11.670 --> 34:14.170
But I didn't act out or--or,

34:14.170 --> 34:15.620
you know, get in trouble
like my brother did.

34:15.620 --> 34:17.880
- Why are you asking this?

34:17.880 --> 34:20.040
- I don't know.
It's just...

34:20.040 --> 34:21.710
ever since I've been back here,

34:21.710 --> 34:23.710
I--I've been having these--
these memories.

34:23.710 --> 34:27.000
- Of what?

34:27.000 --> 34:29.330
- You know, it--
it doesn't matter.

34:29.330 --> 34:31.080
It's been a long day, you know,

34:31.080 --> 34:32.960
and I don't want to
get into all the...

34:32.960 --> 34:35.920
the silly details of it, so.

34:35.920 --> 34:38.960
- You lost your parents Gunnar.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.000
It's not a small thing.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.880
- Kelly, I--I just don't want
to talk about it right now.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.670
- Jill Scott, obviously you knew
her better than I did.

34:45.670 --> 34:47.000
But I crossed paths
with her enough times

34:47.000 --> 34:49.250
in the drug store
to get a sense--

34:49.250 --> 34:50.880
- I mean, it's not like
she hit me or anything.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.250
- Just because nobody hit you

34:52.250 --> 34:54.120
doesn't mean you
don't have scars.

34:57.830 --> 35:00.210
You're all alone.

35:01.670 --> 35:04.880
You were too young
for something like that.

35:06.750 --> 35:08.420
Hey.

35:12.420 --> 35:16.420
You know, when I used to see you

35:16.420 --> 35:19.880
all alone, looking lost.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.920
I never really
worried about you.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.460
You know why?

35:23.460 --> 35:25.250
Because I could tell that you

35:25.250 --> 35:26.580
were going to do
something great.

35:40.080 --> 35:42.880
What's wrong?
- Uh, sorry, it's just--

35:42.880 --> 35:45.620
- No, I understand.
It's okay.

35:45.620 --> 35:49.540
I probably shouldn't
either actually--I'm...

35:51.330 --> 35:55.080
I'm married.

35:55.080 --> 35:57.250
Yeah, Aaron Chambers.

35:57.250 --> 35:58.580
That meathead from high school.

35:58.580 --> 36:01.540
He sells appliances now.

36:01.540 --> 36:04.080
Washers, dryers...

36:04.080 --> 36:06.080
not very successfully but...

36:09.710 --> 36:12.920
I'm not the answer
to anybody's problems.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.880
I'm just a girl with my own.

36:14.880 --> 36:18.750
- (chuckles)

36:21.040 --> 36:22.040
- Think that'll be better.

36:22.040 --> 36:24.620
- Yep.
- All right.

36:24.620 --> 36:26.000
- Can I ask you something?

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
- Yeah, sure.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.040
- Why are you doing this?

36:29.040 --> 36:30.880
- I told you, Jessie,
because I want to.

36:30.880 --> 36:31.880
I like the song.

36:31.880 --> 36:33.580
- But the first time you offered

36:33.580 --> 36:35.500
I was pretty clear that
I couldn't accept your help.

36:35.500 --> 36:37.500
- Well, yeah, but--
- But what?

36:37.500 --> 36:38.960
- You weren't exactly
confidence inspiring

36:38.960 --> 36:40.580
in your plan to get it
done yourself were you?

36:40.580 --> 36:42.500
- Ok, so then you just come in
and do everything for me

36:42.500 --> 36:44.580
And I feel guilty
and then feel like we have to

36:44.580 --> 36:46.000
do everything your way.
- You don't have to do

36:46.000 --> 36:47.540
anything my way.
I never said you did.

36:47.540 --> 36:50.170
- It feels like you're
taking over though.

36:50.170 --> 36:52.540
- I'm sorry if I didn't
listen to you, okay.

36:52.540 --> 36:54.540
But honestly,
all that I want to do

36:54.540 --> 36:57.210
is just to give you a platform
to do your thing, okay.

36:57.210 --> 36:59.830
- Why?
- Because you're good.

36:59.830 --> 37:01.080
Because you deserve it.

37:06.710 --> 37:08.620
- Oh my God.

37:08.620 --> 37:10.460
- What?

37:10.460 --> 37:12.080
- (laughs)

37:12.080 --> 37:13.790
- What?

37:13.790 --> 37:16.620
- I just turned you
into my ex-husband.

37:16.620 --> 37:19.330
And I filtered everything
that you were doing through him

37:19.330 --> 37:21.170
and felt like you were
trying to control me.

37:21.170 --> 37:23.750
- I'm sure I was being
a little pushy,

37:23.750 --> 37:25.880
little too forceful--
- No, I'm so sorry.

37:25.880 --> 37:27.500
- Well, well then,
I'm sorry too.

37:27.500 --> 37:28.500
- Why, you didn't do anything?

37:28.500 --> 37:30.080
- No, I got my thing too.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.670
All right, my whole life
has been a series

37:31.670 --> 37:33.250
of me falling down
and other people coming along,

37:33.250 --> 37:35.580
helping me out,
picking me up.

37:35.580 --> 37:38.210
I think I probably just
got a little swept up

37:38.210 --> 37:40.420
in being on the other side
of that equation one time.

37:42.330 --> 37:45.170
What?

37:45.170 --> 37:47.580
- That's just really sweet.

37:49.620 --> 37:51.290
- So are we going
to do this song or what?

37:51.290 --> 37:52.540
- Yeah.

37:54.580 --> 37:56.790
(playing guitar)

38:10.170 --> 38:13.380
I know it was bad
circumstances for everyone.

38:15.420 --> 38:18.830
You didn't want to
raise two more boys.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.250
And you were grieving too.

38:20.250 --> 38:24.290
But I was 11 years old.

38:24.290 --> 38:26.960
And I felt like if I walked out
of that house

38:26.960 --> 38:28.920
and never came back,
you wouldn't even notice me.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.540
Let alone miss me.

38:34.170 --> 38:36.210
I guess what I'm trying to say

38:36.210 --> 38:39.080
is that sometimes it's--it's
hard to believe in yourself

38:39.080 --> 38:42.540
when no one else ever did.

38:42.540 --> 38:46.880
And I know it's
18 years later and...

38:46.880 --> 38:49.210
nothing's going
to change that.

38:49.210 --> 38:53.540
And I should
probably just move on.

38:53.540 --> 38:56.380
But I just--I needed
to say that to you.

38:56.380 --> 38:59.290
- I raised you the best
I knew how to.

39:13.580 --> 39:15.540
- You know, you never cared
to hear it when I was younger,

39:15.540 --> 39:18.210
so I don't know what the
difference will be now

39:18.210 --> 39:21.420
but I became
a damn good musician.

39:21.420 --> 39:23.210
I'm going to play
something for you

39:23.210 --> 39:26.170
that I wrote last night.

39:26.170 --> 39:27.670
