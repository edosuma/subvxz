WEBVTT

00:04.938 --> 00:08.076
Turns and burns out...

00:08.142 --> 00:09.910
Thousands stand by...

00:09.977 --> 00:13.647
Poised for action.

00:13.714 --> 00:17.885
Knowing that
every second counts.

00:17.951 --> 00:20.688
Always vigilant...

00:20.754 --> 00:23.191
Trying to save lives..

00:23.257 --> 00:25.426
While letting the race run.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.595
Yellow zone...

00:31.299 --> 00:34.335
Le Mans is a car race
like no other.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.736
It's an endurance test

00:35.803 --> 00:38.272
for drivers and cars
that literally

00:38.339 --> 00:41.909
takes 24 hours to complete.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.944
55 cars will start,

00:44.011 --> 00:47.081
but many fewer will
reach the checkered flag.

00:49.317 --> 00:50.918
With unprecedented access

00:50.984 --> 00:52.353
to six of the teams

00:52.420 --> 00:54.255
and the event itself,

00:54.322 --> 00:56.290
this is the story of a race

00:56.357 --> 00:59.493
that pushes technology
to the limit

00:59.560 --> 01:01.495
but where the ghosts of the past

01:01.562 --> 01:04.098
are never far from the present.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.820
Well, for those of you
just joining the race,

01:16.844 --> 01:19.680
Audi have been hit
by a few problems.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.415
Andre Lotterer in
the number 7 car

01:21.482 --> 01:23.384
is still struggling to
get back out front

01:23.451 --> 01:26.487
after he suffered a puncture
just after he took the lead.

01:26.554 --> 01:29.523
And as for the number 8 Audi...

01:32.860 --> 01:34.500
Well, this might look
a total write off,

01:34.528 --> 01:36.597
but the rules of the race say

01:36.664 --> 01:38.065
if you can get back
to the garage

01:38.132 --> 01:39.700
under your own power,

01:39.767 --> 01:41.835
you can repair it and
get back in the game.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.146
The 24 hours of Le Mans,

01:52.213 --> 01:54.014
possibly the only race
in the world

01:54.081 --> 01:57.185
where you can crash and still
have a chance of winning.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.122
Audi brought three cars
here to give themselves

02:02.190 --> 02:03.457
the best chance of victory.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.526
Now, I expect the
mechanics at Audi

02:05.593 --> 02:08.396
to get the number 8 back
on track but with the time

02:08.462 --> 02:09.839
that's been lost
you've gotta say,

02:09.863 --> 02:11.465
it's advantage Porsche.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.349
So as things stand,
it's Porsche

02:19.373 --> 02:21.842
in first and second place,
with the number 17

02:21.909 --> 02:24.512
of Brendon Hartley looking
to stretch his advantage

02:24.578 --> 02:27.248
at the top of the leaderboard.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.255
And if he's to stay up there,

02:34.322 --> 02:37.558
he's going to need to rely,
not just on his own skills

02:37.625 --> 02:39.493
but the large team behind him,

02:39.560 --> 02:41.595
and most importantly
his chief engineer

02:41.662 --> 02:45.233
who is in many ways
the brains of the car.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.674
We can see absolutely everything
that's happening to the car.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.477
Tire pressures,
tire temperatures,

02:56.544 --> 02:59.347
brake temperatures, engine rpm.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.967
I'm in my own little world,
just with me and Kyle,

03:10.991 --> 03:13.071
I mean he's, he's on
the radio speaking back to me...

03:22.370 --> 03:23.704
It's my only point of contact

03:23.771 --> 03:25.739
with...
with the outside world.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.147
We've got engine
adaption engineers,

03:34.214 --> 03:36.284
gearbox engineers,
aerodynamic guys,

03:36.350 --> 03:38.319
suspension guys, engine guys...

03:40.888 --> 03:42.656
They'll be analyzing
this data live

03:42.723 --> 03:45.759
which I then pass
back to the drivers

03:45.826 --> 03:47.661
to make setting
changes on the car.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.730
On the steering wheel
itself we've got lots

03:49.797 --> 03:51.064
of different switches,

03:51.131 --> 03:53.171
and these can change all
sorts of things on the car.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.870
We can change engine mappings,
we can change hybrid mappings.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.476
These fully optimize
the car to make sure

04:02.543 --> 04:04.244
it's running in the sweet spot.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.457
If you put any normal
person in the car

04:16.524 --> 04:18.592
and asked them to do
the amount of switch settings

04:18.659 --> 04:21.261
that we ask, there'd
be a total meltdown.

04:25.299 --> 04:28.068
Further back, Nissan
seem to be emerging

04:28.135 --> 04:29.337
from their nightmare.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.605
Jann Mardenborough in the 23

04:31.672 --> 04:33.350
heroically battling
his way back up the field.

04:33.374 --> 04:36.777
Remember, he started
15 minutes behind
everyone else

04:36.844 --> 04:38.612
when the car stopped on
the starting grid.

04:38.679 --> 04:41.415
He's still down
in 40th position, though.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.955
Everyone's been very, very
professional in the garage.

04:50.858 --> 04:52.726
This team of guys
in there deserve

04:52.793 --> 04:54.294
a finish in one of these cars

04:54.362 --> 04:56.002
and that's what we're
going to try and do.

05:02.235 --> 05:03.680
It's a 24 hour race,
we keep saying it,

05:03.704 --> 05:05.272
but um, we just gotta
keep plugging away

05:05.339 --> 05:06.507
and see what happens.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.821
Well that's the state of
play with the cars

05:11.845 --> 05:13.381
fighting for overall victory,

05:13.447 --> 05:14.682
but as we've said it before,

05:14.748 --> 05:16.350
one of the extraordinary things

05:16.417 --> 05:18.619
about the 24 hours of Le Mans

05:18.686 --> 05:20.020
is that it's not just one race,

05:20.087 --> 05:22.990
but several races going
on at the same time.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.863
And outside of the Le Mans
prototypes, there's something

05:29.930 --> 05:31.832
of a battle taking
place for the lead

05:31.899 --> 05:34.568
in the Grand Touring Pro
category.

05:36.169 --> 05:39.206
It's a proper tussle
out front now,

05:39.272 --> 05:40.608
between the leading Corvette

05:40.674 --> 05:42.242
and the rather
psychedelically painted

05:42.309 --> 05:44.445
Aston Martin, the 97 car.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.515
LMP1 and LMP2

05:47.581 --> 05:49.116
are very much
bespoke racing cars,

05:49.182 --> 05:52.252
whereas the GT obviously
is heavily based on a road car

05:52.319 --> 05:53.599
and that's where the value comes

05:53.654 --> 05:55.055
in for Aston Martin,

05:55.122 --> 05:56.882
so you can see Aston Martin
racing at Le Mans

05:56.924 --> 05:58.392
and on Monday morning you can go

05:58.459 --> 06:00.193
and buy one in the showroom
if you like.

06:00.260 --> 06:03.397
Aston Martin have
a great history in this race,

06:03.464 --> 06:05.332
They've been on
the podium nine times

06:05.399 --> 06:08.135
since they came back
here in 2005.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.337
The last few years have
been rather difficult

06:10.404 --> 06:12.105
particularly for
the number 97 car.

06:12.172 --> 06:15.075
Mechanical problems have
scuppered their chances

06:15.142 --> 06:17.010
year after year.

06:17.077 --> 06:20.080
So that 97 coming in now
for a driver change,

06:20.147 --> 06:22.516
and getting ready is
Darren Turner.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.232
I can't talk for every driver,

06:39.299 --> 06:42.470
but I'm presuming most drivers
think similar to how I think.

06:45.172 --> 06:48.909
'Cause we're pretty sort of
uh, same type of guys.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.545
Same sort of aggression
and competitiveness

06:51.612 --> 06:54.014
and desire to beat the next guy.

06:56.517 --> 06:59.453
Occasionally your mind wanders,

06:59.520 --> 07:00.988
your brain thinks
about something

07:01.054 --> 07:03.657
that's completely irrelevant
from driving the race car.

07:10.397 --> 07:16.537
So this our new wee man,
Dylan, who's a week old

07:16.604 --> 07:18.539
and doing pretty well
at the moment.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.776
I was already really proud
of our little daughter

07:22.843 --> 07:26.313
and now, got a little man
as part of our team.

07:26.379 --> 07:27.848
Yeah we can settle
in now to having

07:27.915 --> 07:29.917
our family life hopefully, so...

07:29.983 --> 07:31.394
But only for a couple
of days because...

07:31.418 --> 07:32.886
You're going.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.388
Yeah, two more days
and I'll be off to Le Mans.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.592
I'm obviously not looking
forward to Darren.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.928
You all right, sweetie?

07:40.994 --> 07:42.362
You all right?

07:42.429 --> 07:45.365
Um...

07:45.432 --> 07:46.900
Yeah, it will be hard and,

07:46.967 --> 07:49.469
and, funny enough,
when having a boy

07:49.537 --> 07:50.647
one of my friends said to me,

07:50.671 --> 07:52.172
"Oh your going to have another,

07:52.239 --> 07:54.450
your gonna have another little
racing driver on your hands."

07:54.474 --> 07:56.009
and I just thought,
"Oh my God."

07:56.076 --> 07:57.878
I've had to go through
it with my husband,

07:57.945 --> 07:59.122
there's no way
I could go through it

07:59.146 --> 08:00.748
with my son as well.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.888
I'd never tell him not
to race, ever dream of it,

08:07.955 --> 08:09.790
because that's,
that's who he is,

08:09.857 --> 08:11.625
that's the person
I fell in love with.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.394
What happened a couple
of years back,

08:14.461 --> 08:18.866
that was just such a...
a big shock.

08:18.932 --> 08:22.202
How they carried on that
year, I have no idea.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.605
I'm not sure what's
happened there.

08:24.672 --> 08:27.875
Simonsen has spun out and
got hit from behind

08:27.941 --> 08:28.876
as he was rolling forward.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.944
That looks very worrying.

08:31.011 --> 08:34.214
This is a huge blow for
the Aston Martin team.

08:36.817 --> 08:40.520
Everybody, shaken by this
accident for Allan Simonsen,

08:40.588 --> 08:43.891
class leader in the world
endurance championship

08:43.957 --> 08:47.360
has passed away because
of his injuries sustained

08:47.427 --> 08:51.431
in the early goings here at
the 24 hours of Le Mans.

08:51.498 --> 08:53.000
He was a champion driver

08:53.066 --> 08:55.535
and he would have been
35 years old next week.

08:55.603 --> 08:58.572
Our hearts and our prayers go...

08:58.639 --> 09:01.008
The accident with Allan
happened very early on,

09:01.074 --> 09:04.144
less than twenty
minutes into the race,

09:04.211 --> 09:08.181
and it's bizarre because
we're driving past it,

09:08.248 --> 09:11.685
and my mind was only thinking
about how I can sort of,

09:11.752 --> 09:13.754
keep pushing for
the lead of the race.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.091
We were probably the last guys
to know because

09:18.158 --> 09:19.803
we were out on track and
we didn't pit until

09:19.827 --> 09:21.729
3 hours into the race.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.599
The team had already
made the decision

09:25.666 --> 09:27.143
that we're going to carry on
and complete the race,

09:27.167 --> 09:28.035
and that was on the back

09:28.101 --> 09:30.237
of the wishes of AllAn's family.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.905
And then it was a case of,

09:31.972 --> 09:35.743
we need to try and win this
race and dedicate it to Allan.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.846
It wasn't to be.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.316
I don't look at the
dangers in our sport

09:43.383 --> 09:44.852
because they're just there.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.920
There are always
gonna be those dangers

09:46.987 --> 09:50.123
and it's part of the appeal.

09:50.190 --> 09:53.360
The idea of pushing to find
the maximum of yourself,

09:53.426 --> 09:55.562
you know, that's what most
driver are out there doing

09:55.629 --> 09:58.598
is trying to find
where their limit is.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.947
- Oh and a spin!
- Darren Turner spins!

10:03.971 --> 10:05.839
Aston spins out to second,

10:05.906 --> 10:08.408
Darren just having to,
I think, get off the brakes.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.077
That's exactly right, John...

10:10.143 --> 10:11.211
Exactly right.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.253
If you knew when your
checkout time was,

10:20.320 --> 10:22.255
and you was having
the best time right up to it,

10:22.322 --> 10:23.724
you'd take that as an option.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.560
Racing at Le Mans
has always been

11:28.588 --> 11:31.091
a dance between the
organizers' desire for safety

11:31.158 --> 11:34.828
and the competitors' unbridled
desire for speed and victory.

11:34.895 --> 11:37.430
And it's gone back all
the way through to 1923

11:37.497 --> 11:39.432
when the race started.

11:39.499 --> 11:43.804
Over the years there have
been 22 fatal accidents here.

11:49.176 --> 11:53.080
The biggest and most
infamous in 1955.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.350
The French driver
Pierre Levegh ploughed

11:57.417 --> 11:58.351
into the grandstand,

11:58.418 --> 12:01.154
83 spectators lost their lives.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.563
Well, ever since then,
modifications have been made

12:10.630 --> 12:13.934
to the race regulations in
a bid to control the speed

12:14.001 --> 12:15.779
of the cars through
the most perilous sections

12:15.803 --> 12:17.905
of the circuit.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.007
The track itself has
evolved to minimize

12:20.073 --> 12:22.175
the risk of serious injury.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.077
Straights have been shortened

12:24.144 --> 12:25.254
so the cars have less chance of

12:25.278 --> 12:27.514
getting into the air
over the crests,

12:27.580 --> 12:29.950
and chicanes have been added
to bring down

12:30.017 --> 12:31.785
the overall top speeds.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.756
Oh my goodness me.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.994
Allan Simonsen's
fatal accident in 2013,

12:41.061 --> 12:42.695
brought in new regulations

12:42.762 --> 12:45.498
and we're seeing them this year.

12:45.565 --> 12:48.235
To keep the race moving once
an accident has happened,

12:48.301 --> 12:51.004
slow zones have been
introduced around the wreckage

12:51.071 --> 12:54.307
with strict speed
limits enforced.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.543
And to warn drivers of
any accident,

12:56.609 --> 12:59.546
the Marshall's put out
boards and wave yellow flags,

12:59.612 --> 13:00.948
and when they are out,

13:01.014 --> 13:03.150
it's forbidden to
overtake anyone else,

13:03.216 --> 13:06.253
and anyone who does so
receives a heavy penalty.

13:16.096 --> 13:19.099
And we've got another
driver change taking place

13:19.166 --> 13:20.433
just down in the pits.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.302
Well, it's the moment

13:22.369 --> 13:24.513
we've all been waiting for,
Mark Webber is getting ready

13:24.537 --> 13:28.108
to get into the
Porsche number 17.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.985
Nine Time F1 Grand Prix
winner Mark Webber

13:38.051 --> 13:40.420
waiting to get
into the car there.

14:12.619 --> 14:16.423
Once you're in the car,
then that's your job.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.089
That's the window
that we enjoy you know,

14:18.125 --> 14:20.760
being in the car,
we have immense power

14:20.827 --> 14:22.762
with the 919 hybrid,

14:22.829 --> 14:25.565
fastest car in the
world on the straights.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.645
Mark Webber is in the race
for the first time.

14:29.669 --> 14:32.272
Porsche has saved
their ex-Formula 1 ace

14:32.339 --> 14:34.841
for the stint that's
going to take them

14:34.908 --> 14:36.376
from dusk to night.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.689
Mr. Webber into the
lead of this race,

14:49.756 --> 14:54.261
the 17 Porsche,
Mark Webber leads Le Mans.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.834
Being in the car at night,
just got the headlights,

15:01.901 --> 15:03.903
clearing the back markers...

15:05.505 --> 15:07.607
and you can see the fans
in the grandstands,

15:07.674 --> 15:10.910
and you can smell
the barbecues coming alight.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.013
It doesn't happen at
any other race.

15:15.882 --> 15:17.184
It's an incredible experience

15:17.250 --> 15:19.152
for a driver in the cockpit.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.624
Well, it's pretty close
to full darkness here.

15:24.691 --> 15:27.294
Most of the teams on
their second driver change,

15:27.360 --> 15:29.196
no doubt their teammates
trying to catch

15:29.262 --> 15:31.498
just a few winks
before getting back

15:31.564 --> 15:33.033
into the driver seat.

15:59.592 --> 16:02.695
In GT Pro, Rob Bell
has taken over

16:02.762 --> 16:05.298
from Darren Turner and
is just two seconds

16:05.365 --> 16:06.866
behind the leading Corvette.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.648
Not such good news
for Nissan,

16:12.672 --> 16:15.175
two cars in the garage
including that

16:15.242 --> 16:16.676
of Jann Mardenborough.

16:16.743 --> 16:19.946
Gotta say, they look set
for a long, hard night.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.432
The Toyota number 1
of Sebastien Buemi,

16:29.456 --> 16:31.824
behind the 8th placed Rebellion.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.435
Still at the head of the race,

16:42.502 --> 16:45.938
Mark Webber coming in
now for a quick refuel
in the red Porsche.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.221
Hot on his heels
the number 7 Audi,

16:52.245 --> 16:55.282
Marcel Fassler driving.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.585
The gap, 22 seconds now,
between first and second.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.903
Ooh! Big problems for one of
the Ferrari GT drivers!

17:16.969 --> 17:19.372
They'll need to get him out
of that car pretty quickly.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.574
Fire marshals are in attendance.

17:21.641 --> 17:24.077
Looks like they've had
some kind of a fuel spill.

17:24.144 --> 17:28.515
Maybe this'll help out our
friends in the Aston Martin.

18:09.222 --> 18:12.192
Down in 4th position,
the black Porsche number 18

18:12.259 --> 18:14.527
has been going well
but, oh dear, oh dear,

18:14.594 --> 18:16.829
that looks like a driver error.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.674
Yeah, he just missed
the turn completely

18:18.698 --> 18:20.400
and, well, now
that means Porsche

18:20.467 --> 18:22.402
is down to just two
bullets in their gun

18:22.469 --> 18:25.272
to battle for the overall race.

18:26.873 --> 18:30.510
Seeing more mistakes now
as fatigue sets in.

18:31.744 --> 18:34.347
Oh, that's an LMP2 car
crashing out.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.794
Well, we knew it was going to
be a tough race this year,

18:38.818 --> 18:44.191
we're down to 48 cars out
of the 55 that started.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.805
Rob?

19:03.610 --> 19:05.245
Oh shit!

19:05.312 --> 19:08.548
And we've got er,
one of the, perhaps,

19:08.615 --> 19:10.149
Aston Martin's has stopped?

19:10.217 --> 19:11.851
Rob Bell behind the wheel.

19:11.918 --> 19:15.355
Number 97 Aston,
it is, it's the, uh...

19:15.422 --> 19:19.158
it's the multicolored one.
Darren Turner's car.

19:33.906 --> 19:36.509
Huge disappointment.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.478
Effectively, we're game over,

19:38.545 --> 19:40.280
and we're not even halfway
in the race

19:40.347 --> 19:42.349
and you just wanna,

19:42.415 --> 19:44.451
you just wanna get to that
point and then, you know

19:44.517 --> 19:46.262
that you've at least had
a, a good run at it.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.087
But, you know,
effectively we're sort of out

19:48.154 --> 19:49.622
before we've really
got going and uh,

19:49.689 --> 19:51.157
that's the bitter
disappointment.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.793
We've now had three years
on the bounce,

19:53.860 --> 19:58.097
where our car 97 has had a,
sort of a technical problem,

19:58.164 --> 20:00.099
and I really thought this year,

20:00.166 --> 20:02.635
we'd have all the
luck in the world,

20:02.702 --> 20:05.505
and we'd be in good shape and
be able to get to the end.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.340
And it's just not to be.

20:34.667 --> 20:37.537
It's just,
it's just devastating.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.540
Yeah, I've had a
chat with Katie,

20:40.607 --> 20:42.342
she's always very
wise with her words.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.911
And it's nice, you know,
you're pretty low

20:44.977 --> 20:47.213
after getting the news
that you're out of the race

20:47.280 --> 20:49.349
and having a phone call
from Katie.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.726
It would have been nice
having her here

20:50.750 --> 20:53.019
because she would have
given a lot more support,

20:53.085 --> 20:55.988
but, you know, that phone call
meant a lot at the time.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.894
The whole team is disappointed.

21:01.961 --> 21:05.832
When it's all running perfectly,
then a split second,

21:05.898 --> 21:08.100
the smallest thing in
the shortest of times

21:08.167 --> 21:10.837
can go and that's difficult.

21:29.356 --> 21:31.099
Well, remember now,
Porsche's car was

21:31.123 --> 21:33.793
the fastest in qualifying,
but I tell ya, Audi,

21:33.860 --> 21:36.996
in spite of their problems
are not giving up.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.532
There's only one second
now between Mark Webber

21:39.599 --> 21:41.734
and the Audi number 7.

21:41.801 --> 21:46.038
We have got big news,
a one minute

21:46.105 --> 21:48.708
stop and go penalty
for car number 17

21:48.775 --> 21:52.011
for overtaking under the yellow.

21:52.078 --> 21:54.414
And that of course
is the Mark Webber car,

21:54.481 --> 21:57.316
the number 17 Porsche
which currently sits

21:57.384 --> 21:59.352
at the top of the screens so,

21:59.419 --> 22:04.023
that's going to throw a very
big cat amongst these pigeons.

22:06.959 --> 22:10.296
We're going to see a
stop and go penalty,

22:10.363 --> 22:12.865
that's half a lap and more.

22:12.932 --> 22:15.034
This is going to
balance it back out,

22:15.101 --> 22:16.736
this is going to be
advantage Audi.

22:18.605 --> 22:20.983
And we're actually hearing
that that penalty was given

22:21.007 --> 22:23.342
to Brendon Hartley for
overtaking under the yellow

22:23.410 --> 22:25.945
before Webber got in the car.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.515
So Mark Webber is
serving a penalty

22:28.581 --> 22:31.418
for his teammate's mistake.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.287
I was trying to
prove to the team

22:35.354 --> 22:36.623
that I could do a good job,

22:36.689 --> 22:38.401
and I was getting so
frustrated with the traffic.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.927
We had to talk a lot with
Brendon just to keep him up

22:40.993 --> 22:43.463
because he was the one
causing the penalty.

22:43.530 --> 22:47.534
I'm at a point where,
I just want to get it home.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.503
Gap to Porsche 25 seconds.

22:50.570 --> 22:53.540
I was giving it all,
but I don't know,

22:53.606 --> 22:57.076
our car is somehow a bit slow.

22:57.143 --> 22:59.679
Anybody who has studied
warfare will tell you

22:59.746 --> 23:02.081
that the best time to attack
is during the night.

23:02.148 --> 23:04.083
We're having some problems...
