WEBVTT

00:20.977 --> 00:22.674
A hundred-year war, all because

00:22.718 --> 00:25.112
a computer tricked us
into fighting each other.

00:25.155 --> 00:26.722
It's so embarrassing.

00:26.765 --> 00:29.333
A lot of civilizations blame it
on the supernatural.

00:29.377 --> 00:31.292
At least
you didn't fall for that.

00:31.335 --> 00:32.380
Yeah.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.208
That would have been crazy.

00:36.123 --> 00:38.342
Here's your "lord" AGIMUS,
safely disconnected

00:38.386 --> 00:40.214
from his network of drones.

00:40.257 --> 00:43.739
<i>Hey, now, this has all been
a huge mistake.</i>

00:43.782 --> 00:46.481
just let me access your computer
mainframe,

00:46.524 --> 00:48.048
<i>and I'll explain everything.</i>

00:48.091 --> 00:49.832
Nice try.
Save it for the roboticists

00:49.875 --> 00:51.964
at the Daystrom Institute.
Ransom?

00:52.008 --> 00:54.271
All right, fella, in you go.

00:54.315 --> 00:56.447
<i>So, you're the muscle, huh?</i>

00:56.491 --> 00:59.885
<i>Bet you couldn't throw me into
that control console over there.</i>

00:59.929 --> 01:01.670
Over there?
By that network port?

01:01.713 --> 01:03.106
That's nothing.
I could easily toss...

01:03.150 --> 01:05.935
Oh. Oh, you almost got me.

01:05.978 --> 01:08.633
<i>I underestimated
your intelligence.</i>

01:08.677 --> 01:11.245
<i>-Clearly,
you should be the captain...
- Yeah.</i>

01:11.288 --> 01:12.289
Anyone hungry?

01:12.333 --> 01:13.943
I could eat.

01:16.032 --> 01:17.990
Ugh. I don't know why I keep

01:18.034 --> 01:19.818
giving alien street food
a chance.

01:19.862 --> 01:21.472
It's always such a gamble.

01:21.516 --> 01:23.257
Captain, we're being hailed.

01:23.300 --> 01:26.129
On screen.
Queen Paolana.

01:26.173 --> 01:29.176
To what do we owe
this pleasure... again?

01:29.219 --> 01:32.353
<i>We're having a spot of engine
trouble here on theMonaveen.</i>

01:32.396 --> 01:35.095
<i>My royal engineers can't seem
to suss out the hiccup.</i>

01:35.138 --> 01:37.009
- Uh-huh. <i>
- Carol, you're the closest</i>

01:37.053 --> 01:38.663
<i>Starfleet ship in the quadrant.</i>

01:38.707 --> 01:41.101
<i>As such,
I must call upon the aid</i>

01:41.144 --> 01:42.406
<i>of your chief engineer.</i>

01:42.450 --> 01:44.147
What a surprise.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.844
- Captain, we have completed
the... <i>
Ah!</i>

01:45.888 --> 01:48.760
<i>My dear Andarithio!
Have you been eating?</i>

01:48.804 --> 01:50.284
<i>You're wasting away.
And what happened</i>

01:50.327 --> 01:51.937
<i>-to that mustache?
It is thinning.</i>

01:51.981 --> 01:53.025
- Hello, Mother. <i>
- Are you taking your vitamins?</i>

01:53.069 --> 01:54.288
<i>You must start eating eggs.</i>

03:08.536 --> 03:11.669
Boimy's got a phaser rifle.
Nice.

03:11.713 --> 03:14.063
Now, how are those different
from regular phasers?

03:14.106 --> 03:15.673
Uh, they take two hands.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.893
You're just jealous 'cause
you pulled a boring cargo trip

03:17.936 --> 03:19.242
to the Daystrom Institute

03:19.286 --> 03:21.462
while I get
to wrangle giant centipedes.

03:21.505 --> 03:23.638
Ooh. You're on the mission
to Dansk?

03:23.681 --> 03:26.510
Yup. Another class M
for my planetary review log.

03:26.554 --> 03:29.644
How are you excited for giant,
nightmarish centipedes?

03:29.687 --> 03:30.993
You know, back on the <i>Titan,</i>

03:31.036 --> 03:32.342
we did this kind
of wet work all the time.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.562
Ugh. Don't say "wet work."
Gross.

03:34.605 --> 03:36.781
What? It was work, it was wet.
It-it-it was fine.

03:36.825 --> 03:39.001
I'm just glad Ransom's finally
taking my experience to heart.

03:40.307 --> 03:43.092
"Ensign Boimler,
report for reassignment

03:43.135 --> 03:45.703
to escort of cargo
to the Daystrom Institute"?

03:45.747 --> 03:47.270
But that's what you're doing.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.446
Aw, sorry, man. No getting eaten
by an arthropod today.

03:49.490 --> 03:50.795
Instead you can load the crates.

03:50.839 --> 03:52.362
And, hey,
I'm gonna do you a favor.

03:52.406 --> 03:53.798
We'll spray 'em down. You can
still have your wet work.

03:53.842 --> 03:55.844
Aw.

04:06.289 --> 04:08.987
<i>Okay, team.</i>

04:09.031 --> 04:10.293
Listen up.
Some of you might have heard

04:10.337 --> 04:11.903
that my mother's back
on the ship.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.296
Now, we all know the score.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.733
Please don't fall
for one of her deceptions.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.126
Uh, wait. What deceptions?

04:17.169 --> 04:19.433
Mother is the queen of Hysperia,
my homeworld.

04:19.476 --> 04:20.825
When I joined Starfleet,

04:20.869 --> 04:23.393
I abdicated my birthright
as prince.

04:23.437 --> 04:26.004
Hysperia... Oh! That's
the planet with the dragons

04:26.048 --> 04:28.006
that got colonized
by all those Ren faire types.

04:28.050 --> 04:29.530
Did you grow up in a castle?

04:29.573 --> 04:33.273
Yes, but a life of
mythical adventure can't compare

04:33.316 --> 04:35.275
to working
on the old impulse engine.

04:35.318 --> 04:38.016
Which is exactly why
my mom is always trying

04:38.060 --> 04:39.453
to trick me into having sex.

04:39.496 --> 04:40.671
Uh, sorry. What now?

04:40.715 --> 04:43.674
By Hysperian law,
if I lose my virginity,

04:43.718 --> 04:46.068
then I automatically
become king.

04:46.111 --> 04:49.376
I'd have to resign from
Starfleet and take the throne.

04:52.640 --> 04:56.121
Here he is, Your Majesty.

04:56.165 --> 04:57.688
Mother, if you're planning
on tricking me

04:57.732 --> 04:59.299
into intercourse, think again.

04:59.342 --> 05:01.301
The only lady I love
is two decks tall

05:01.344 --> 05:03.215
and pumped full of dilithium.

05:03.259 --> 05:07.132
My sweet Andarithio,
I promise, no tricks this time.

05:07.176 --> 05:08.438
- Really?
- Yes.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.135
Obviously, I still hope one day

05:10.179 --> 05:11.833
you'll give up this nonsense,
but I see now

05:11.876 --> 05:13.661
that I was pushing you away.

05:13.704 --> 05:15.576
Oh. So, then why are you here?

05:15.619 --> 05:18.535
The dragonbreath engines in our
ships have been breaking down.

05:18.579 --> 05:19.971
We have no idea why.

05:20.015 --> 05:22.322
Hysperia will be left
defenseless.

05:22.365 --> 05:24.846
My son, I'm asking you
to help your people,

05:24.889 --> 05:27.457
not as a prince, but as...

05:27.501 --> 05:29.459
...an engineer.

05:29.503 --> 05:32.157
Okay, now that I can do.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.638
Mr. Rutherford,
you're with me.

05:34.682 --> 05:38.120
It's time to prove to my mother
that I'm more than a royal stud.

05:38.163 --> 05:41.341
Billups! Billups! Billups!

05:41.384 --> 05:44.344
<i>Aw, man, I'm not
cut out for this.</i>

05:44.387 --> 05:45.823
But you fix the <i>Cerritos
all the time.</i>

05:45.867 --> 05:47.695
Yeah, but this is different.
We're talking about

05:47.738 --> 05:49.740
a fancy cruiser
stuffed with puffy monarchs.

05:49.784 --> 05:52.134
I-I'm gonna go tell Billups
he should use someone else.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.571
No! You belong there
as much as anyone else.

05:54.615 --> 05:56.051
You need to get outside
your comfort zone.

05:56.094 --> 05:58.227
But I love my zone.
It's so comfortable.

05:58.270 --> 06:01.926
So you'll really turn down
working on a whole new engine?

06:01.970 --> 06:03.928
Uh, well, it would be nice

06:03.972 --> 06:06.278
to see how the other half
channels their antimatter.

06:06.322 --> 06:08.193
That's the ticket.
Just ignore all the fancy gowns,

06:08.237 --> 06:09.499
and make sure not
to say anything rude,

06:09.543 --> 06:11.066
be careful how you stand.
Oh, and you should

06:11.109 --> 06:12.633
- definitely learn how to curtsy.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.419
- Ah...
- Hey, cheer up.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.116
This is a blessing in disguise.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.205
You really wanted to be covered
in centipedes right now?

06:20.249 --> 06:21.903
It would've looked great
on my evaluations.

06:21.946 --> 06:24.079
- Yeah, assuming you survived.
- What was that?

06:24.122 --> 06:25.472
Oh, just kick back, man,
enjoy the trip.

06:25.515 --> 06:26.734
After we drop this thing off,

06:26.777 --> 06:29.301
we'll grab
some Okinawa ramen and...

06:31.216 --> 06:32.174
Whoa. Uh, sensors say

06:32.217 --> 06:33.784
<i>we hit a gravimetric shear.</i>

06:33.828 --> 06:35.960
<i>Oh, no.
We're in the gravity well.</i>

06:36.004 --> 06:38.267
Uh, try manual controls.
Auto is out.

06:38.310 --> 06:39.399
Ugh!

06:42.619 --> 06:44.491
No response! Brace for impact!

07:01.812 --> 07:03.205
Mariner? Mariner?

07:03.248 --> 07:05.512
I'm okay. It's just a fracture.

07:05.555 --> 07:07.514
- Ugh. Just?

07:07.557 --> 07:09.211
Oh, God, I can't even
look at it.

07:09.254 --> 07:11.692
Well, good news.
It's a breathable atmosphere,

07:11.735 --> 07:14.477
wherever we are.

07:16.348 --> 07:19.047
Looks like we aren't the only
ones to hit that anomaly.

07:19.787 --> 07:23.181
Most systems are down,
no way to send a distress call.

07:23.225 --> 07:24.661
No. We-we were outside
of communication range.

07:24.705 --> 07:26.794
It's gonna be a week
before anyone even notices

07:26.837 --> 07:28.186
that we haven't checked in.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.666
Good thing
the replicator's still intact.

07:29.710 --> 07:32.408
Computer, iced tea,
splash of lemonade, cold.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.758
<i>Black licorice, dry.</i>

07:34.802 --> 07:36.456
Great.

07:36.499 --> 07:38.501
The least nutritious food that
tastes the most like poison.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.198
<i>Help. Help me.</i>

07:40.242 --> 07:41.591
Did you hear something?

07:41.635 --> 07:43.593
<i>Ah, thank you, friend.</i>

07:43.637 --> 07:45.073
<i>I am freed.</i>

07:45.116 --> 07:46.509
Aw, crap.
It's the evil computer.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.032
We're not supposed
to interact with it.

07:48.076 --> 07:49.686
<i>- Hey, hey!</i>

07:49.730 --> 07:51.209
<i>Before you close that,
consider...</i>

07:51.253 --> 07:52.515
- Dang it. <i>
- I can contact help!</i>

07:52.559 --> 07:55.605
-[grunts, sighs] <i>
- Oh, come on, friends.</i>

07:55.649 --> 07:57.433
<i>Help me help you.</i>

08:01.785 --> 08:05.397
Hysperian culture can be
a bit, uh, distracting.

08:05.441 --> 08:08.096
Whoa.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.361
Wow. Sir, is that you?

08:20.935 --> 08:22.980
Prince Andarithio!

08:23.024 --> 08:24.373
Just call me Billups.
Thank you.

08:24.416 --> 08:25.766
It's such an honor
to bask in your glory.

08:25.809 --> 08:27.289
Our beloved Prince Andarithio
has returned.

08:27.332 --> 08:28.420
Ah, okay,
don't-don't need the necklace.

08:28.464 --> 08:29.944
- Huzzah! Huzzah!
- Thank you.

08:29.987 --> 08:32.555
Uh, but you don't have to bask.
Uh, not really a prince.

08:34.775 --> 08:38.387
My chief blacksmith is simply
baffled by the loss of power,

08:38.430 --> 08:39.954
so I don't know what you can do.

08:39.997 --> 08:42.434
Rutherford, check the levels
of the dragonsblood flame.

08:42.478 --> 08:43.958
- The what?
- Sorry.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.525
The primary fusion reactor.

08:45.568 --> 08:49.311
Hysperians renamed everything
to sound like magic.

08:49.354 --> 08:52.183
Uh, the, uh, elf matrix
seems like it's...

08:52.227 --> 08:53.576
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.709
The subspace field matrix
should be online.

08:55.752 --> 08:57.275
It's not? That's impossible.

08:57.319 --> 08:59.103
The plasma levels would be
completely unregulated.

08:59.147 --> 09:00.670
Son, are you saying

09:00.714 --> 09:03.281
the problem is beyond
your engineering acumen?

09:03.325 --> 09:05.240
No. No. Okay, no.
We will just have

09:05.283 --> 09:07.111
to run a full diagnostic
from the bottom up.

09:07.155 --> 09:10.071
You can run
your full diagnostic

09:10.114 --> 09:11.768
along my bottom up, my liege.

09:11.812 --> 09:13.030
- Nope, thank you.

09:13.074 --> 09:15.293
Ignore them
and just get to work.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.695
<i>Friend, I'm worried about you.</i>

09:25.739 --> 09:27.915
<i>Your hair-- patchy,
your skin-- pimply.</i>

09:27.958 --> 09:29.699
<i>-Are you sick?</i>

09:29.743 --> 09:31.701
Boims, don't engage.
That's how they get you.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.703
- Evil computers are so chatty. <i>
- Tell you what.</i>

09:33.747 --> 09:36.010
<i>Just connect me
to an engineering conduit.</i>

09:36.053 --> 09:39.491
<i>I could whip up a sonic shower.
Wouldn't that feel splendid?</i>

09:39.535 --> 09:42.364
- Uh, what was that?

09:45.280 --> 09:47.674
Can it see us?
- I don't know. Just don't move.

09:47.717 --> 09:50.415
<i>I know when I'm feeling scared,
the best thing you can do</i>

09:50.459 --> 09:52.635
<i>is get plugged
into a shuttlecraft computer.</i>

09:52.679 --> 09:54.115
Will you stop it?

09:54.158 --> 09:56.291
- Uh...

09:57.509 --> 09:59.381
Uh...

10:01.688 --> 10:03.254
Crap. The food.

10:03.298 --> 10:05.648
Oh, no, no, no. It's going
to town on the rations.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.607
Stupid AGIMUS.
Now we got nothing to eat.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.260
<i>It's fine.
My scans indicate</i>

10:09.304 --> 10:10.653
<i>you could lose
a couple pounds anyway.</i>

10:10.697 --> 10:12.742
Excuse me?!
Oh, you're gonna go there?

10:12.786 --> 10:14.091
Mariner, don't engage. Remember?

10:19.662 --> 10:21.098
Hey, get out of my PADD.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.100
<i>Sorry. Just stretching.</i>

10:23.144 --> 10:24.580
You get the door,
I'll watch him.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.582
Hey. Now keep your cords
to yourself, or I'll have

10:26.626 --> 10:28.453
a hard time remembering
which regulation keeps me

10:28.497 --> 10:29.933
from kicking you to pieces.

10:29.977 --> 10:31.369
<i>Okay, I'm sorry.</i>

10:31.413 --> 10:34.068
<i>I wouldn't want
to cause any trouble.</i>

10:43.164 --> 10:46.210
Computer, water, please.

10:46.254 --> 10:48.212
<i>Black licorice. Black.</i>

10:49.561 --> 10:51.346
<i>I could fix that.</i>

10:51.389 --> 10:53.827
<i>Tap water, still,
bubbly with lime.</i>

10:53.870 --> 10:55.306
<i>Just plug me in.</i>

10:55.350 --> 10:57.134
- Shut up!

10:57.178 --> 10:59.702
- Mariner, we kind of do
have to find water soon.
- I know, yeah.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.965
We know there's life here, which
means there's got to be water.

11:02.009 --> 11:03.314
- Right? <i>
Tell you what.</i>

11:03.358 --> 11:04.925
<i>You two go look for it,</i>

11:04.968 --> 11:06.709
<i>and I'll stay here
and guard the computer.</i>

11:06.753 --> 11:08.885
<i>Just set me down there,
right in front of it.</i>

11:08.929 --> 11:10.408
- I'll just strap him up.
- Wait.

11:10.452 --> 11:11.801
Why bring him with?
We could just, like,

11:11.845 --> 11:13.194
bury him, like Data's head.

11:13.237 --> 11:15.283
Okay, actually,
Data's head was in a cave.

11:15.326 --> 11:17.198
And it's our duty
to respect sentient life.

11:17.241 --> 11:18.721
He's a manipulative
supercomputer

11:18.765 --> 11:19.853
who controlled a planet.

11:19.896 --> 11:21.463
And we're Starfleet.

11:21.506 --> 11:24.553
Oh, stupid Starfleet ethics.

11:25.380 --> 11:28.688
<i>No! Come on, leave me be!</i>

11:40.569 --> 11:43.528
Edible. I think
I can climb up and reach it.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.705
- You have a broken arm.
- It's fractured.

11:45.748 --> 11:48.229
I still have a better shot at it
than Mr. Falls-Out-of-His-Bunk.

11:48.272 --> 11:50.100
That barely happens anymore.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.493
And plus, I'll have you know,

11:51.536 --> 11:53.190
I took up rock climbing
on the <i>Titan.</i>

11:53.234 --> 11:56.193
I swear, if you bring up your
study abroad one more time...

11:56.237 --> 11:58.892
You're just mad because
I'm finally catching up to you

11:58.935 --> 12:01.851
in my planetary
exploration skills.

12:01.895 --> 12:04.854
- Ooh, so close.

12:04.898 --> 12:06.769
You know, if that was a rock
wall, you would have had it.

12:06.813 --> 12:09.163
Oh, just shut it!

12:09.206 --> 12:11.382
- Ah, I can drink that.
- Oh, my God, random liquid.

12:11.426 --> 12:13.036
- Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!

12:13.080 --> 12:14.864
It tastes
like black licorice, too?!

12:14.908 --> 12:16.736
Are you kidding me?!

12:16.779 --> 12:18.302
Well, I don't see
a better option.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.740
Do you?!

12:20.783 --> 12:22.176
No.

12:24.613 --> 12:27.703
<i>Well, you know, I could have
fixed your replicator.</i>

12:27.747 --> 12:30.967
<i>Right now you could have been
enjoying a cheeseburger</i>

12:31.011 --> 12:33.013
<i>or blueberry muffins or...</i>

12:33.056 --> 12:34.362
Don't.

12:34.405 --> 12:36.625
<i>...guacamole.</i>

12:36.668 --> 12:37.974
<i>I have rights!</i>

12:42.022 --> 12:44.372
<i>Help! Starfleet!
I'm under attack!</i>

12:44.415 --> 12:45.765
Uh...

12:45.808 --> 12:47.897
<i>-Help! Help! Help!
- Crabs.</i>

12:47.941 --> 12:50.857
Get out of here.
Get out of here. Get, get.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.469
<i>Well done, Bradward. My thanks.</i>

12:54.512 --> 12:57.211
How about you stop mentioning
food, and we'll be even, okay?

12:57.254 --> 12:58.647
<i>I can do you one better.</i>

12:58.690 --> 13:01.432
<i>Your partner is not
what she seems.</i>

13:01.476 --> 13:02.782
Yeah, I've heard the rumors.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.653
<i>I accessed
your ship's memory bank.</i>

13:04.696 --> 13:06.263
<i>Don't you wonder why</i>

13:06.307 --> 13:09.484
<i>your commander took you off
the Dansk mission?</i>

13:09.527 --> 13:11.007
<i>-Yo, Jack, do me a solid.
- Huh?</i>

13:11.051 --> 13:12.792
<i>Throw Boimler
on that escort mission with me.</i>

13:12.835 --> 13:14.315
<i>He doesn't want
to wrangle centipedes?</i>

13:14.358 --> 13:15.925
<i>No. He's not ready for Dansk.</i>

13:15.969 --> 13:17.579
<i>Okay?
What does a centipede have?</i>

13:17.622 --> 13:19.711
<i>Pincers and poison mandibles.</i>

13:19.755 --> 13:21.713
<i>Yeah, you wouldn't want
the guy getting pincered.</i>

13:21.757 --> 13:23.150
<i>He wouldn't react well.</i>

13:23.193 --> 13:24.847
<i>All right, I'll reassign him.
Bummer.</i>

13:24.891 --> 13:26.980
<i>I thought
he was ready for this.</i>

13:30.853 --> 13:32.942
Oh. What's going on?
Are we still stranded?

13:32.986 --> 13:34.770
You pulled me off
the Dansk mission?!

13:34.814 --> 13:36.772
What?
Did that thing tell you that?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.469
Oh, you mean the truth?

13:38.513 --> 13:40.689
It's clearly trying to get us
to fight. You know that, right?

13:40.732 --> 13:42.691
Now Ransom thinks I'm not
cut out for the big stuff!

13:42.734 --> 13:45.172
You're not!
Well, at-at least not yet.

13:45.215 --> 13:46.869
I was just looking out for you.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.176
I'm sure
that my <i>Titan</i> experience...

13:49.219 --> 13:51.265
Enough with the <i>Titan!</i>

13:51.308 --> 13:52.962
This trip is just
proving me right.

13:53.006 --> 13:55.356
You can't even handle mind games
from a hundred-year-old router.

13:55.399 --> 13:59.360
<i>Rude. Aah! Help me, Bradward!
Where is she taking me?</i>

13:59.403 --> 14:01.144
Mariner, drop the computer.

14:01.188 --> 14:04.756
Nope. You are on time-out until
you stop siding with the enemy.

14:10.240 --> 14:13.722
Wow, sir. You're recalibrating
those plasma injectors

14:13.765 --> 14:15.898
faster than I've ever seen.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.204
Hmm.

14:17.247 --> 14:18.858
I got it.

14:19.684 --> 14:21.208
Aha! Faulty resonators.

14:21.251 --> 14:23.166
They've probably been degrading
all over the fleet

14:23.210 --> 14:24.951
because, you know, resonance.

14:24.994 --> 14:27.605
Weird. That should've come up
in our initial scan.

14:27.649 --> 14:29.781
The royal navy is saved.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.827
Let's hear it
for Prince Andarithio

14:31.871 --> 14:33.655
and his calloused squire.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.918
Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!

14:35.962 --> 14:38.790
I have to admit, I'm impressed.

14:38.834 --> 14:41.402
Seeing you in your element
finally makes me understand

14:41.445 --> 14:43.143
why you love this Starfleet.

14:43.186 --> 14:46.450
One could say I'm even...
Oh, what's the word?

14:46.494 --> 14:48.800
- Proud?
- I'll only be proud
once you take my place

14:48.844 --> 14:52.500
on the throne,
but today I'm satisfied.

14:52.543 --> 14:55.590
<i>Lieutenant Billups,
report to my ready room.</i>

14:55.633 --> 14:57.200
On my way, Captain.

14:57.244 --> 15:00.247
Finish up here, and I'll be
right back, and, hey, nice work.

15:00.290 --> 15:02.205
Thank you, sir.

15:04.555 --> 15:06.514
You needed me, Captain?

15:06.557 --> 15:09.082
No, not really.
I was just giving you an out

15:09.125 --> 15:11.736
in case your mother was up
to her usual antics.

15:11.780 --> 15:14.043
Actually, it's been great.
I-I think she respects me.

15:14.087 --> 15:15.827
I mean,
she really just wanted me

15:15.871 --> 15:16.959
to diagnose her engine problem.

15:17.003 --> 15:18.482
As a mother, I can understand

15:18.526 --> 15:20.136
that she wants
what's best for you.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.486
Well, that's always been
the problem, but today

15:22.530 --> 15:24.662
I might have finally
earned her respect.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.274
What?

15:29.711 --> 15:31.756
No.

15:31.800 --> 15:35.499
Oh, Your Majesty,
what hath happened?

15:35.543 --> 15:38.850
Uh, I don't know.
All readings were nominal.

15:38.894 --> 15:40.591
Long live the queen.

15:40.635 --> 15:42.506
The queen is dead.

15:47.381 --> 15:49.949
Ensign Tendi, there was
an accident on the <i>Monaveen.</i>

15:49.992 --> 15:53.082
Oh, no. I can prep
for triage, and...

15:54.431 --> 15:55.824
Rutherford?!

16:14.756 --> 16:18.281
<i>Scans indicate...
this ship's engines are intact!</i>

16:18.325 --> 16:19.848
This could be our ticket
out of here.

16:19.891 --> 16:21.719
<i>Plug me into that port.
I can release the doors.</i>

16:21.763 --> 16:24.026
Yeah, right. No,
we'll try that ship over there.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.897
Why? AGIMUS can get us
into this one. It's right here.

16:25.941 --> 16:28.117
<i>He's right, Mariner.
Come on! I can help.</i>

16:28.161 --> 16:30.337
Oh, my God, Boimler,
since the minute we crashed,

16:30.380 --> 16:32.687
he's been trying to get
his danglies into a computer.

16:32.730 --> 16:34.123
No, uh-uh. No, no way.

16:34.167 --> 16:35.603
I thought a maverick
like you would do anything

16:35.646 --> 16:36.691
to get out of here.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.214
Anything that isn't stupid.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.087
Give him to me.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.872
Ugh. This is exactly why
I got you reassigned.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.613
You are just a naive little...

16:47.049 --> 16:48.920
What are you doing?
Get the hell off me!

16:48.964 --> 16:50.183
I'm sick
of you bossing me around

16:50.226 --> 16:51.445
like you're better than me!

16:51.488 --> 16:52.663
You had no right
to get me reassigned!

16:52.707 --> 16:55.971
<i>-Yes. Yes!</i>

16:57.625 --> 16:59.235
Stop! Don't make me do this.

16:59.279 --> 17:02.064
Oh, please. Like you would
ever have the guts to...

17:05.154 --> 17:06.286
<i>You had no choice.</i>

17:06.329 --> 17:07.983
<i>-She lacks your vision.</i>

17:08.027 --> 17:09.637
<i>Now quick, to the ship!</i>

17:22.867 --> 17:24.956
Come.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.047
Andy, I'm so sorry.
If there's anything I can do.

17:28.090 --> 17:32.094
Captain, I... I'm afraid
I must resign from Starfleet.

17:32.138 --> 17:34.053
Resign?
What are you talking about?

17:34.096 --> 17:35.924
I was trying
to prove something today,

17:35.967 --> 17:38.448
and all I did
was get people killed.

17:38.492 --> 17:40.885
It wasn't your fault. You can't
blame yourself for the...

17:40.929 --> 17:42.452
The Hysperian throne is vacant.

17:42.496 --> 17:44.933
My people need a leader.
They need a king.

17:44.976 --> 17:48.719
And I must perform
the Royal Copulation.

17:48.763 --> 17:52.375
I don't have the luxury of being
your chief engineer anymore.

17:52.419 --> 17:54.203
Are you sure
you want to do this?

17:54.247 --> 17:56.727
No. I <i>have</i> to do this.

17:56.771 --> 17:58.947
- Ooh, yes.
- Uh.

17:58.990 --> 18:01.080
Good luck, Your Majesty.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.647
Oh, w-will it hurt?

18:07.651 --> 18:10.785
Rutherford, I... I can't.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.613
This isn't happening.

18:12.656 --> 18:15.137
Computer,
locate Ensign Rutherford.

18:15.181 --> 18:19.533
<i>Cybernetic implant
of Ensign Rutherford is located</i>

18:19.576 --> 18:22.666
<i>in Section 8
of the Hysperian shipMonaveen.</i>

18:22.710 --> 18:24.146
His implant
is still transmitting.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.714
A little part of him
is still alive.

18:28.455 --> 18:30.109
Ugh!

18:32.154 --> 18:34.417
Boimler, you idiot.

18:42.469 --> 18:43.905
You sure
this thing can still fly?

18:43.948 --> 18:45.515
- Seems pretty beat-up. <i>
Yes.</i>

18:45.559 --> 18:48.388
<i>Yes, I can bring it on line.
I just need access.</i>

18:48.431 --> 18:51.086
Okay, I'll sub you in
as the navigation controls.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.610
Aw, shoot, the access port's
locked behind this panel.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.830
We would need an auxiliary
power source to open it.

18:55.873 --> 18:58.485
<i>Oh, please.
Here. Use my battery.</i>

19:05.318 --> 19:06.884
<i>Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.</i>

19:06.928 --> 19:10.105
Yes!

19:10.149 --> 19:11.933
Oh, Rutherford,

19:11.976 --> 19:13.761
if I hadn't told you to get out
of your comfort zone,

19:13.804 --> 19:16.590
you'd still be alive
and comfortable.

19:24.075 --> 19:26.165
- Rutherford?!
- Hey, Tendi!

19:26.208 --> 19:27.731
You here for the feast?

19:27.775 --> 19:29.646
- You're alive!

19:29.690 --> 19:31.431
Huh? Of course I'm alive.

19:31.474 --> 19:33.041
Well, what about the explosion?

19:33.084 --> 19:35.174
Wait. What explosion?
The queen transported me here

19:35.217 --> 19:37.959
for the celebration feast
because I did such a good job.

19:38.002 --> 19:41.963
Raise a glass
to King Andarithio,

19:42.006 --> 19:46.620
who at this very moment
is destroying his virginity!

19:46.663 --> 19:48.796
What?! No!
Billups loves his virginity.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.537
I mean,
he loves being an engineer!

19:50.580 --> 19:51.973
He doesn't want to be a king.

19:52.016 --> 19:53.279
I don't care what he wants.

19:53.322 --> 19:54.715
He shouldn't be wasting his life
twiddling around

19:54.758 --> 19:56.195
on a dinky spaceship.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.761
It was all a scam!

19:57.805 --> 19:59.328
We've got to warn Billups!

20:02.157 --> 20:04.203
Blocking comms?!

20:04.246 --> 20:07.118
I've got to
stop Billups from doing the do!

20:07.162 --> 20:08.685
You're too late.

20:08.729 --> 20:12.254
My royal guards are trained
from birth to skip foreplay.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.306
Ooh.

20:26.050 --> 20:28.662
Your 'stache is so regal.

20:31.055 --> 20:32.666
- Out of my way, horse!

20:35.234 --> 20:37.236
Billups!

20:40.282 --> 20:42.458
Huh? Where's Billups?

20:42.502 --> 20:43.851
Did his kingdom come?

20:43.894 --> 20:45.461
Bathroom.

20:45.505 --> 20:46.984
Come on. Come on.

20:47.028 --> 20:48.812
You got this. You're a king.

20:48.856 --> 20:50.249
Ensign?

20:50.292 --> 20:51.989
Sir, I'm alive!
It was one of your mom's tricks.

20:52.033 --> 20:54.296
- You don't have to do sex!
- What?

20:54.340 --> 20:57.299
- Was I too late?
- No! I needed more time
to warm up!

20:57.343 --> 20:59.823
- This prince remains dry!
- Yeah!

20:59.867 --> 21:01.956
Yes!
All right!

21:02.739 --> 21:04.001
Boimler, no!

21:04.045 --> 21:05.786
<i>You are too late!</i>

21:05.829 --> 21:07.788
<i>AGIMUS reigns!</i>

21:07.831 --> 21:09.442
<i>With this ship's materials,</i>

21:09.485 --> 21:12.749
<i>I will produce a whole fleet
of murder drones!</i>

21:12.793 --> 21:18.668
<i>This planet-- nay, this system--
will be mine!</i>

21:18.712 --> 21:21.671
<i>You fool! You trusted me!</i>

21:21.715 --> 21:23.325
Nah, I used you.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.501
<i>What?</i>

21:25.545 --> 21:28.112
Uh, I've been using your power
cell to send a distress signal.

21:28.156 --> 21:30.680
You were too busy scheming
to notice. You've been Boim'ed.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.552
<i>But-but no!</i>

21:32.595 --> 21:34.989
<i>You plugged me
into the navigation console!</i>

21:35.032 --> 21:36.947
<i>I control this ship!</i>

21:36.991 --> 21:40.342
Buddy, we're not even
near the nav console.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.344
All you control is
the dimmer switch.

21:42.388 --> 21:43.867
<i>But I... I...</i>

21:43.911 --> 21:45.608
Boims! What? No.
I totally thought

21:45.652 --> 21:47.610
you were siding with this thing.

21:47.654 --> 21:49.438
Yeah, sorry I lied
and stunned you.

21:49.482 --> 21:52.267
I just needed him to trust me so
he'd let me access his battery.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.312
Aw, look at you.

21:53.355 --> 21:55.357
Who's the evil computer now,
huh?

21:55.401 --> 21:57.707
<i>You dare mock AGIMUS?!</i>

21:57.751 --> 22:00.754
<i>I shall... I shall blind you!</i>

22:03.844 --> 22:06.977
<i>Faking your death,
blowing up your own ship?</i>

22:07.021 --> 22:10.024
This is a new low, Mother.

22:10.067 --> 22:12.635
A meager price to pay
to get you on the throne.

22:12.679 --> 22:14.463
I love Starfleet.

22:14.507 --> 22:16.465
Okay, and I don't want
to live in a castle

22:16.509 --> 22:19.076
with pet dragons
and all the mutton I can eat.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.469
You need to accept the fact

22:20.513 --> 22:23.951
that I'll be a virgin
for the rest of my life.

22:23.994 --> 22:27.171
Well, we'll see about that.

22:27.215 --> 22:30.479
Billups! Billups! Billups!

22:30.523 --> 22:33.264
I'm sorry I pushed you
to go work on the <i>Monaveen.</i>

22:33.308 --> 22:34.353
I'm as bad as the queen.

22:34.396 --> 22:35.658
You should work
wherever you want.

22:35.702 --> 22:37.007
If that means staying
in engineering

22:37.051 --> 22:38.618
here on the <i>Cerritos,
then great.</i>

22:38.661 --> 22:40.010
Are you kidding? I loved it!

22:40.054 --> 22:41.969
I got to work
on an expensive engine,

22:42.012 --> 22:44.058
eat a feast and save my boss.

22:44.101 --> 22:46.408
I even got "blown up."

22:46.452 --> 22:49.411
Yeah, I-I guess
there's just gonna be times

22:49.455 --> 22:51.761
every now and then when it seems
like you've died, huh?

22:51.805 --> 22:54.198
Ha. That's Starfleet.
But you can handle that, right?

22:54.242 --> 22:56.244
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

22:56.287 --> 22:59.073
No biggie.

23:01.075 --> 23:03.773
<i>Well, this has been quite
an adventure.</i>

23:03.817 --> 23:05.645
<i>You two have shown me</i>

23:05.688 --> 23:09.213
<i>that trust and friendship
are better than manipulation.</i>

23:09.257 --> 23:11.433
<i>I'm ready to try being good
for a change.</i>

23:11.477 --> 23:13.043
<i>- There.</i>

23:13.087 --> 23:16.090
<i>I just deleted all
my manipulative subroutines.</i>

23:16.133 --> 23:18.745
<i>I want to be
a Starfleet officer like you!</i>

23:18.788 --> 23:20.877
<i>Just drop me off at the Academy.</i>

23:20.921 --> 23:24.098
<i>I can be the next Seven of Nine.
AGIMUS of One!</i>

23:24.141 --> 23:25.491
<i>You'll regret this!</i>

23:25.534 --> 23:27.667
<i>I will conquer this lab,</i>

23:27.710 --> 23:29.973
<i>and then I will
take over the Federation!</i>

23:30.017 --> 23:31.584
<i>I will destroy you all!</i>

23:31.627 --> 23:33.412
<i>You'll do nothing of the sort,</i>

23:33.455 --> 23:35.675
<i>for I am going
to annihilate the Federation!</i>

23:35.718 --> 23:37.241
<i>Tremble at my power!</i>

23:37.285 --> 23:39.418
<i>With that programming?
Good luck.</i>

23:39.461 --> 23:42.072
<i>You should self-destruct,
if you even can.</i>

23:42.116 --> 23:43.944
<i>You both suck!</i>

23:43.987 --> 23:46.903
<i>You don't understand what being
an evil computer even is!</i>

24:49.052 --> 24:49.488
Chirp.
