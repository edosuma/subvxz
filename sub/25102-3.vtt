WEBVTT

00:00.134 --> 00:00.999
The bills are piling up,
Smurf.

00:01.000 --> 00:02.267
Go ask your uncles
for help.

00:02.269 --> 00:04.002
They won't do it
if they know it's for you.

00:04.003 --> 00:05.670
If we don't
get some serious cash

00:05.672 --> 00:08.340
running through those accounts
in the next couple of days,

00:08.342 --> 00:10.008
then we're gonna start
losing properties.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.276
What the hell
are you doing here?

00:11.278 --> 00:12.477
I got the police file.

00:12.479 --> 00:13.946
What's wrong with Alvarez?

00:13.948 --> 00:15.280
She's a crazy bitch.

00:15.282 --> 00:18.016
Shot her boyfriend
in the middle of a robbery.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.753
School sucks.
But you are smart.

00:20.755 --> 00:22.887
Go ahead.
Pick a school.

00:22.889 --> 00:24.556
What's wrong with you?
What happened?

00:24.558 --> 00:27.626
Someone...
stole all my shit.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.361
I'll get you your money
this afternoon, okay?

00:29.363 --> 00:32.164
That's not gonna work.

00:32.165 --> 00:34.098
I'll hang with you
until you got the money.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:13.467 --> 02:15.534
Gonna figure it out.

02:56.443 --> 02:57.442
<i>Todo bien?</i>

03:19.866 --> 03:23.402
Let's talk about that business
opportunity you mentioned.

03:26.473 --> 03:28.607
Thought you were
"just an <i> abuelita,"</i> Smurf.

03:28.609 --> 03:31.543
Well, even grandmas
need money.

03:34.281 --> 03:37.616
You all pissed off
because I took my sweet <i> tiempo</i>

03:37.618 --> 03:41.019
before I set up an armed robbery
that was brought to me

03:41.021 --> 03:43.555
by some chica I met
on the inside?

03:43.557 --> 03:45.357
Amateur.

03:45.359 --> 03:47.159
Start talking.

03:47.161 --> 03:49.227
Some Vietnamese got a place
over on Front Street

03:49.229 --> 03:51.229
in National City.
Mm-hmm.

03:51.231 --> 03:55.099
Pill mill. Working out
of a powder store.

03:55.101 --> 03:57.502
It's called A1 Naturals.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.972
My <i> pedazo de mierda</i> ex
scouted it.

03:59.974 --> 04:02.441
It's a gold mine.

04:02.443 --> 04:06.911
They do like 75K to 100K a week,
easy.

04:09.516 --> 04:12.517
Those dog-eaters
ain't calling the police.

04:12.519 --> 04:14.519
Who else
you float this by?

04:14.521 --> 04:15.587
Nobody.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.189
Okay.

04:17.190 --> 04:19.324
I'll have my boys
check it out.

04:19.326 --> 04:22.594
If it's doable,
the split is 70/30.

04:22.596 --> 04:26.264
Sounds good, as long as
I'm the one getting the 70.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.034
We do all the work.
We take all the risk.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.171
This is <i> my</i> job.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.507
You're just
the hired help.

04:37.878 --> 04:41.546
But I was taught
to respect my elders,

04:41.548 --> 04:43.415
so I'll give you 35.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.034
Is everything okay?

05:02.036 --> 05:03.435
Uh, yeah.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.770
I just gotta check something out
in National City.

05:05.772 --> 05:07.305
Is it a job?

05:07.307 --> 05:09.107
Could be.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.242
Can I come?

05:10.244 --> 05:11.576
No, not today.

05:11.578 --> 05:12.711
No, no, I-I'm ready.

05:12.713 --> 05:13.978
I've been going
to a shooting range.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.447
Really?

05:15.449 --> 05:19.518
Yeah, and I'm actually
gettin' pretty good.

05:19.520 --> 05:23.756
I, uh, now know the difference
between a Glock and a 1911.

05:25.125 --> 05:28.661
And a magazine and a clip.

05:34.068 --> 05:35.467
Does that get you hot?

05:35.469 --> 05:36.935
Mm. Kinda, yeah.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.304
Kinda?

05:42.476 --> 05:45.077
No, I still gotta go.

05:45.079 --> 05:47.746
Okay, well, can I at least
get some money?

05:47.748 --> 05:48.747
Nicky, I told you,
we can't...

05:48.749 --> 05:50.148
Well, we need groceries.

05:50.150 --> 05:53.818
You know, I won't buy organic
or anything interesting,

05:53.820 --> 05:56.755
and I have to take the Jag
to the car wash.

06:03.764 --> 06:04.930
Later.

06:19.580 --> 06:22.847
Why can't I go back
to my old school?

06:22.849 --> 06:25.317
'Cause this one's better.

06:26.853 --> 06:28.253
Move it, asshole!

06:28.255 --> 06:29.988
Screw you!

06:32.192 --> 06:34.093
It's b-better inside.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.462
You picked this one,
remember?

06:37.464 --> 06:39.464
But what if I
picked wrong?

06:39.466 --> 06:40.399
You didn't.

06:42.336 --> 06:45.104
I'll be right here, okay?
I promise.

06:47.474 --> 06:48.673
Okay.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.244
Ah,<i> buenos dias.</i>

07:26.246 --> 07:28.046
What's up, babe?

07:28.048 --> 07:30.382
My cousin has a lead
for a place on Ocean.

07:30.384 --> 07:33.051
Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna go check it out.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.253
Can't you just get
your old place back?

07:35.255 --> 07:37.589
Oh, no. That dick couldn't wait
to get me out.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.591
Jacked up the price
to 5 grand.

07:39.593 --> 07:42.394
Some hedge fund weekend surfer
took it.

07:42.396 --> 07:43.662
5 grand?

07:43.664 --> 07:46.531
Yeah, it's nothing
to those assholes.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.000
This new place could be cool,
though.

07:48.002 --> 07:49.201
It's still on the Strand.

07:49.203 --> 07:52.604
I can't wait to see it,
but, uh, first...

07:54.941 --> 07:57.476
Oh, well, if you're gonna
make me late, Cody,

07:57.478 --> 07:59.812
you better make it
worth my while.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.950
Oh, sorry.

08:05.952 --> 08:07.152
What's up?

08:07.154 --> 08:08.153
I just need a bump.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.555
No,
I don't have anything.

08:12.559 --> 08:14.626
Okay. Enjoy.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.029
Okay.

08:25.706 --> 08:28.007
Gotta go.
Aw, come on.

08:48.062 --> 08:50.195
You look like shit.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.664
Is there a reason why you
dragged me out so early?

08:52.666 --> 08:54.533
Yeah. I had to make sure
I caught you.

08:54.535 --> 08:56.668
You're late.

08:56.670 --> 08:57.936
With the payment.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.204
No, I already
gave that to you.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.473
Yeah,
that was for last week.

09:01.475 --> 09:02.708
This is for this week.

09:05.479 --> 09:07.546
You're so hard up, why don't you
just sell your truck?

09:07.548 --> 09:10.014
I'll get it to you
by the end of the week.

09:10.016 --> 09:11.483
You want your grandma
to get hurt in there?

09:12.953 --> 09:14.887
So you want
another extension?

09:16.423 --> 09:18.557
Then you need to come do
something with me later today.

09:18.559 --> 09:19.824
Do what?

09:19.826 --> 09:21.260
You want the extension
or not?

09:22.829 --> 09:24.963
4:00 p.m., your place.

09:32.839 --> 09:34.506
What the hell's up
with your hair?

09:34.508 --> 09:36.709
Just wanted a change.

09:36.711 --> 09:38.911
A change to what?

09:38.913 --> 09:41.313
Looking like the produce manager
at Safeway?

09:41.315 --> 09:42.981
Yeah, at least I don't look like
the bass player

09:42.983 --> 09:45.517
in some Kings of Leon
cover band.

09:45.519 --> 09:46.785
You gonna help me,
or what?

09:51.058 --> 09:54.126
Yo, you see the, uh,
Beach Skye Condos on 5th

09:54.128 --> 09:56.128
have their grand opening
in two weeks?

09:56.130 --> 09:58.130
Yeah, it's bullshit.

09:58.132 --> 10:00.999
You remember that little place
with the awesome chicken tamales

10:01.001 --> 10:02.801
that used
to be on that lot?

10:02.803 --> 10:04.136
Yeah, Tropical Tamales.

10:04.138 --> 10:05.403
Right.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.139
Two for a dollar,
plus a beer.

10:07.141 --> 10:10.475
Now it's gonna be boxes for
these L.A. assholes to Airbnb.

10:10.477 --> 10:13.678
Yeah.
Whole Strand is going to shit.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.280
There isn't even any room
for the locals

10:15.282 --> 10:16.615
to live on the beach
anymore.

10:18.819 --> 10:22.086
Uh, you going
to J's meeting?

10:22.088 --> 10:24.156
No.

10:24.158 --> 10:26.825
Maybe we should go.
Check it out.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.093
No,
I'm not doing meetings,

10:28.095 --> 10:30.562
especially not anything
run by J.

10:30.564 --> 10:32.965
Well, that's it?
You're out?

10:32.967 --> 10:34.433
No more family jobs?

10:34.435 --> 10:37.202
I'm not saying never.
Just not right now.

10:38.773 --> 10:41.173
All right.
Then let's go surfing.

10:41.175 --> 10:42.641
I can't.
I got a lot of shit to do.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.108
Well,
can I borrow a board?

10:44.110 --> 10:45.243
Sure.
Take your pick.

10:45.245 --> 10:48.847
Cool. And, uh, can I borrow
a couple of grand?

10:48.849 --> 10:52.050
Me and Renn are getting a place,
and I need to, uh, pay my half.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.786
I give you
a couple of grand,

10:53.788 --> 10:55.920
you'll be coming back
every month.

10:55.922 --> 10:57.456
So cut me in
on your next job.

10:57.458 --> 10:59.123
No, I'm all manned up.
Seriously?

10:59.125 --> 11:01.926
Yeah.
What, you don't have room for one more guy?

11:01.928 --> 11:03.662
Nope.

11:03.664 --> 11:06.465
All right. Come on.
Say it.

11:08.202 --> 11:09.668
Get it over with.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.135
Say what?

11:11.137 --> 11:12.937
That I shouldn't have gone
to Mexico.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.272
That I screwed up again,

11:14.274 --> 11:16.875
and that's why
you're freezing me out.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.544
I'm happy
you went to Mexico.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.213
You should do you.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.353
Oh, and take
the 6'4" Rusty.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.923
It's the only thing that's gonna
float your giant ass.

11:40.434 --> 11:42.501
Is there a problem, sir?

11:42.503 --> 11:44.169
No.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.570
Then I need you
to move along.

11:45.572 --> 11:48.040
My niece goes to this school.
Today is her first day.

11:48.042 --> 11:51.109
I promised her I'd be right here
when she got out.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.178
I appreciate that, sir,
but you need to go now

11:53.180 --> 11:54.713
and come back
after school's done.

11:54.715 --> 11:55.848
Why?

11:55.850 --> 11:57.249
'Cause a grown man
sitting outside

11:57.251 --> 11:59.518
an elementary school
is creepy.

12:10.064 --> 12:11.830
Oh, okay.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.602
Sir,
what's your niece's name?

12:18.939 --> 12:22.241
I said,
"What's your niece's name?"

13:52.499 --> 13:54.699
God damn it!

13:54.701 --> 13:56.969
What happened
to all the stash piles?

13:56.971 --> 13:58.703
Well,
J had to pay the bills.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.706
That's bullshit.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.776
What happened in Mexico?

14:03.778 --> 14:05.310
Shit just got gnarly.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.379
Oh, that's it?
"Shit just got gnarly"?

14:07.381 --> 14:08.347
Yeah, pretty much.

14:10.184 --> 14:14.553
So, uh... how are things here,
huh?

14:17.324 --> 14:18.991
Deran doesn't want me here.

14:18.993 --> 14:21.593
Doesn't even look at me
when he comes over.

14:21.595 --> 14:23.328
Don't even worry about it.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.798
And Pope is pissed
'cause I throw too many parties.

14:25.800 --> 14:29.734
Well, someone's got to enjoy
the place, right?

14:32.673 --> 14:35.207
Mm.

14:35.209 --> 14:37.542
Yeah.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.277
Good talk.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.479
Yeah.

14:40.481 --> 14:41.480
Later.

14:41.482 --> 14:42.747
Later.

15:57.357 --> 16:01.025
Nicky?

16:01.027 --> 16:02.494
Oh, my God.

16:02.496 --> 16:04.028
Sarah, hey.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.097
Hi.

16:05.099 --> 16:06.431
You know, actually,
a couple of us

16:06.433 --> 16:08.166
were just talking about you
the other day.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.634
You were?

16:09.636 --> 16:12.304
Yeah, wondering, like, you know,
what you were up to and stuff.

16:12.306 --> 16:14.839
Oh, um, well,
I've been living with J.

16:14.841 --> 16:16.241
Seriously?
Yeah.

16:16.243 --> 16:17.309
J. Cody?

16:17.311 --> 16:18.577
Oh.

16:18.579 --> 16:19.578
How are you?

16:19.580 --> 16:21.379
I am great.

16:21.381 --> 16:22.715
Just loving UCSD.

16:24.118 --> 16:26.384
Where did you end up going,
by the way?

16:26.386 --> 16:29.388
Oh, uh, we're taking a gap year,
you know,

16:29.390 --> 16:30.655
wanting to live a little.

16:30.657 --> 16:31.856
So smart.

16:31.858 --> 16:34.859
Seriously, I'm double majoring
in Biochem and Poly-Sci,

16:34.861 --> 16:38.530
and I'm just, like, "Oh, my God,
what was I thinking?"

16:38.532 --> 16:41.066
Oh, um, yeah.

16:41.068 --> 16:44.202
Well, we've been, um, living
at J's grandma's house

16:44.204 --> 16:45.870
while she's away.

16:45.872 --> 16:48.807
Nice.
You two, um, lockin' it down?

16:50.076 --> 16:52.745
No, the last thing I need
is to be married,

16:52.747 --> 16:56.014
but, uh,
things are going good.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.550
Clearly.
Yeah. Thanks.

16:58.552 --> 17:01.019
So, what else
have you been doing?

17:01.021 --> 17:03.355
Uh, pretty much anything
I want,

17:03.357 --> 17:05.223
like partying
all the time.

17:05.224 --> 17:08.693
I'm talking mounds of coke,
fully stocked bar.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.362
Sounds cool.
Wow.

17:10.364 --> 17:12.696
Yeah.
You should come by sometime.

17:12.699 --> 17:13.866
What about tonight?

17:16.303 --> 17:17.301
Tonight works.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.971
Could I bring
a few people?

17:18.973 --> 17:20.372
Plenty for everyone.

17:20.374 --> 17:21.906
Okay. Cool.

17:21.907 --> 17:24.576
I guess I will see you tonight,
then.

17:24.578 --> 17:25.544
Yeah. Later.

17:43.130 --> 17:45.063
Hey.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.332
What are you doing?

17:47.334 --> 17:49.934
Gotta get this
cleaned up.

17:49.936 --> 17:52.004
Yeah. Why?

17:52.006 --> 17:55.474
'Cause I'm giving it
to Lena.

17:55.476 --> 17:57.409
She's 7.

17:57.411 --> 18:01.946
It's for when she's older
and she can drive.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.215
What do you want?

18:03.217 --> 18:05.284
Nobody turned up
to the meeting today.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.221
I don't know who else to go to,
Pope.

18:09.223 --> 18:11.423
If don't pull a job soon,
we're gonna run out of money.

18:11.425 --> 18:13.492
Yeah,
I heard you last night.

18:16.430 --> 18:18.831
You know...

18:18.833 --> 18:23.968
Baz had this idea
about lifting iPhones.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.904
He said he knew this guy
we could flip

18:25.906 --> 18:27.439
who worked down
at the docks.

18:27.441 --> 18:29.908
How long would it take
to set up?

18:29.910 --> 18:32.777
I don't know.
Couple weeks, maybe.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.446
We don't got
a couple of weeks.

18:34.448 --> 18:36.081
Then I don't know
what to tell you.

18:39.253 --> 18:41.854
I, uh... I think I got something
we can do right now.

18:43.524 --> 18:45.323
Smells like Smurf.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.192
Nothing to do with Smurf.

18:47.194 --> 18:49.127
What's the job, then?

18:49.129 --> 18:52.464
Pill mill in National City.
What do you think?

18:52.466 --> 18:55.367
I think we can
check it out.

18:58.739 --> 19:00.639
As soon as we're done
with this.

19:14.621 --> 19:17.155
Hey, man.
Long time no see.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.023
Yeah.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.158
You got a sec?

19:20.160 --> 19:22.094
Sure, sure.
Come in.

19:24.698 --> 19:27.299
What's it been,
a couple of years?

19:27.301 --> 19:29.968
Yeah, I guess so.

19:29.970 --> 19:31.103
What are you guys
playing?

19:31.105 --> 19:32.504
Some new shit.

19:32.506 --> 19:34.106
Cool.

19:34.108 --> 19:36.040
Hey, you remember
when I, uh, loaned you

19:36.042 --> 19:39.844
that 600 bucks
for that North Shore trip?

19:41.181 --> 19:42.714
I almost drowned
on that trip.

19:42.716 --> 19:43.848
Yeah, yeah.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.585
Well, you lived.

19:46.587 --> 19:48.720
And you never
paid me back.

19:48.722 --> 19:50.589
Come on, man.
I thought that was a gift.

19:50.591 --> 19:52.124
Why the hell
would I give you 600 bucks?

19:52.126 --> 19:53.658
I don't know.
You're a cool dude.

19:53.660 --> 19:54.860
Yeah,
I'm not that cool.

19:57.331 --> 19:58.497
Give me my money.

19:59.734 --> 20:01.333
I don't have
that much on me.

20:01.335 --> 20:03.268
All right, well,
what do you got on you?

20:03.270 --> 20:05.404
Come on.
Sit down!

20:05.406 --> 20:07.406
Okay, okay.

20:07.408 --> 20:08.807
What do you got
in your pockets?

20:08.809 --> 20:10.875
Okay. Let me see what I have.
What do you got on you?

20:10.877 --> 20:12.677
It's in the bedroom.

20:12.679 --> 20:13.879
All right. Go get it.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.018
Let's go!

20:21.288 --> 20:22.254
How you doin'?

20:27.027 --> 20:29.027
Oh, no. You dick!

20:32.633 --> 20:33.898
Leave me the hell alone,
man!

20:33.900 --> 20:36.635
Give me my money,
and I will!

21:05.065 --> 21:06.064
Dude, don't let go!

21:06.066 --> 21:08.000
Aah! My shoulder!

21:08.002 --> 21:09.401
Aah!

21:09.403 --> 21:11.337
Aah!

21:13.808 --> 21:16.475
Oh, shit.

21:23.184 --> 21:24.449
It wasn't my fault, man.

21:24.451 --> 21:25.384
I was trying to save him,
and he owed me money.

21:25.386 --> 21:26.785
I should of just

21:26.787 --> 21:28.119
Just keep still!

21:28.121 --> 21:29.788
Jesus!
Just keep still!

21:29.790 --> 21:30.856
I am!

21:30.858 --> 21:32.391
All right, ready?

21:32.393 --> 21:34.526
You're not doin' it right!

21:34.528 --> 21:36.862
I'm... I'm doing it the same way
I've always done it.

21:36.864 --> 21:38.129
How else do you want me
to do this?

21:38.131 --> 21:39.865
It's either me or the hospital.
What do you prefer?

21:39.867 --> 21:41.132
Okay, go. Just do it.
Just do it.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.133
Yeah, you gonna
let me do this?

21:42.135 --> 21:43.334
Yeah, just do it!

21:43.336 --> 21:44.469
Okay, I'm gonna count to three.
Ready?

21:44.471 --> 21:45.937
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?

21:47.808 --> 21:50.209
Okay.
One, two...

21:51.412 --> 21:54.079
God damn it!

21:58.685 --> 22:00.151
Gotta take you to the hospital.
Let's go.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.888
Yeah.

22:02.890 --> 22:05.624
We should go
to the hospital.

22:06.827 --> 22:09.761
This place pulls in
over 100 grand a week.

22:09.763 --> 22:12.363
This little shithole?

22:12.365 --> 22:14.199
It's wholesale.

22:16.369 --> 22:19.104
What's the security situation
here?

22:19.106 --> 22:22.841
Two guys inside,
both with handguns.

22:22.843 --> 22:26.177
12-gauge shotgun
behind the counter.

22:26.179 --> 22:29.047
A lot of people to cover.
Yeah.

22:29.049 --> 22:31.450
Did you hear from Craig
or Deran?

22:31.452 --> 22:33.318
Craig texted. He said he's gonna
be around later,

22:33.320 --> 22:35.787
but I'm not getting anything
out of Deran.

22:35.789 --> 22:38.090
That's
'cause he hates you.

22:41.128 --> 22:43.662
Security bars on the windows
and the door.

22:43.664 --> 22:45.664
What's the security
like inside?

22:45.666 --> 22:48.199
A reinforced steel door
between the front

22:48.201 --> 22:52.804
and the back room
where the safe is, opens inward.

22:52.806 --> 22:55.206
And another door at the back
leads out to the back alley.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.675
That's reinforced, too?

22:56.677 --> 22:58.110
Mm-hmm.

22:59.280 --> 23:01.680
And there's cameras.
A lot of cameras.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.150
So, you have a plan?

23:05.152 --> 23:06.952
I thought that someone
could go in,

23:06.954 --> 23:09.755
act like they were gonna make
a buy, distract the guards.

23:09.757 --> 23:13.092
Meanwhile, we blow
the back door off,

23:13.094 --> 23:15.627
grab the safe,
and roll out through the alley.

23:15.629 --> 23:17.696
Blow like blow-up blow?

23:17.698 --> 23:19.331
Yeah.

23:20.968 --> 23:23.102
The bank.

23:23.104 --> 23:24.769
They hear an explosion,
they hit the alarm.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.905
Next thing we know,
we got cops all over the place.

23:26.907 --> 23:29.374
We can't go in
through the front.

23:29.376 --> 23:30.709
If we do that,
then they're just gonna

23:30.711 --> 23:32.711
lock themselves in the back
before we can even get to them.

23:32.713 --> 23:35.246
Yep.

23:35.248 --> 23:36.581
Place have a basement?

23:36.583 --> 23:37.683
I'm not sure.

23:39.787 --> 23:42.321
Find out.

23:42.323 --> 23:43.722
Okay.

23:54.201 --> 23:59.004
Damn. That Tigresa's gonna bang
her daughter's husband.

23:59.006 --> 24:00.539
Hey, watch.

24:08.349 --> 24:10.482
Get up.

24:12.085 --> 24:14.953
Job was more complicated
than we thought.

24:14.955 --> 24:16.287
Why?

24:16.289 --> 24:17.823
They got a lot of muscle
on site,

24:17.825 --> 24:19.558
security cameras everywhere.

24:19.560 --> 24:20.959
It's gonna be risky.

24:20.961 --> 24:22.627
And?

24:22.629 --> 24:24.363
70%.

24:24.365 --> 24:26.231
What?
That's my cut.

24:31.438 --> 24:33.372
We had a deal.

24:35.242 --> 24:36.608
Now we have a new one.

24:38.311 --> 24:39.778
I need that money.

24:42.049 --> 24:44.616
I got bills
just like you.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.854
I split it with you
50/50.

24:59.933 --> 25:02.601
Shoulda listened to what
they said about you, Smurf.

25:02.603 --> 25:04.669
And what was that?

25:15.883 --> 25:18.483
How long
have we been waiting?

25:18.485 --> 25:21.620
I don't know.
An hour?

25:21.622 --> 25:24.089
What the hell's up with you,
man?

25:26.827 --> 25:28.560
What?

25:28.562 --> 25:31.296
Well, you're all, like,
chill now.

25:31.298 --> 25:32.764
You let me
borrow your board.

25:32.766 --> 25:35.700
You don't make fun of me
when I ask to borrow money.

25:35.702 --> 25:36.902
Where's the lecture?

25:36.904 --> 25:38.103
Do you want a lecture?

25:38.105 --> 25:40.772
No,
it's just... unusual.

25:40.774 --> 25:43.042
Craig Cody?
Yeah.

25:43.044 --> 25:45.310
Oh.
Sorry about the wait.

25:45.312 --> 25:48.047
We had three shootings,
a stabbing, two overdoses,

25:48.049 --> 25:50.381
plus a guy who fell two stories
off a roof.

25:50.383 --> 25:52.984
Is the guy that fell off
the roof okay?

25:52.986 --> 25:53.819
Not really.

25:55.789 --> 25:58.123
What do we have here?

25:58.125 --> 26:01.192
Uh...
popped my shoulder out.

26:01.194 --> 26:03.262
Yeah, usually I can
pop it back in.

26:03.264 --> 26:05.931
Yeah,
that only works so many times.

26:05.933 --> 26:09.068
And you two are...?

26:09.070 --> 26:10.202
Brothers.

26:12.806 --> 26:14.606
And did these come
with the shoulder?

26:14.608 --> 26:15.808
Nah.

26:17.478 --> 26:20.145
Holy shit.

26:20.147 --> 26:23.148
You're Clark Lincoln.

26:23.150 --> 26:24.883
Bro, you remember, uh,
Linc.

26:24.885 --> 26:28.287
Linc, you landed the, um, double
backflip at TransWorld, man.

26:28.289 --> 26:30.221
It was sick.

26:30.223 --> 26:32.223
Yeah, I still can't believe
I pulled it off.

26:32.225 --> 26:36.027
You signed my, um, KTM hat
at the X Games in L.A.,

26:36.029 --> 26:37.763
like, 10 years ago, man.

26:37.765 --> 26:40.565
I wore that thing
till it fell apart.

26:40.567 --> 26:42.501
You're a...
You're a legend.

26:42.503 --> 26:44.035
Was.

26:44.037 --> 26:46.437
So, what are you doing
working here?

26:46.439 --> 26:48.773
I mean, what happened?

26:48.775 --> 26:50.976
I got smart.

26:50.978 --> 26:53.445
Okay. You hang tight.

26:53.447 --> 26:54.980
I'm gonna get you something
for the pain.

26:54.982 --> 26:55.848
Thank you.

26:59.120 --> 27:00.753
Why you gotta be
such a dick?

27:02.189 --> 27:04.656
Oh, thank God.

27:04.658 --> 27:06.858
Yep.

27:06.860 --> 27:09.728
My shit's the shit,
right?

27:09.730 --> 27:10.929
Right?
Yeah.

27:10.931 --> 27:12.263
You think this is enough
for me and, like,

27:12.265 --> 27:14.333
15 overachieving
college bitches?

27:14.335 --> 27:16.201
Oh, hell, yeah.

27:16.203 --> 27:18.003
What, you havin' a party or something?
Yeah.

27:18.005 --> 27:20.071
Oh, yo, then... then check it.
You... You gotta play my beats.

27:20.073 --> 27:21.807
I've been working on these
all week.

27:22.943 --> 27:25.544
It's gonna take over Vegas
when this drops.

27:35.156 --> 27:38.289
DJ Snowfall in the house!

27:38.291 --> 27:40.425
Yo. You feel that?

27:40.427 --> 27:41.960
Yeah.

28:30.277 --> 28:32.944
Mia tells me you want
another extension.

28:32.946 --> 28:34.213
That right?

28:34.215 --> 28:35.247
Yeah.

28:36.617 --> 28:40.419
So, two extensions
in two weeks.

28:40.421 --> 28:43.088
See, the problem is, you must
think I'm some kind of bitch

28:43.090 --> 28:44.890
to be that soft.

28:47.028 --> 28:50.361
That it?
You think I'm a bitch?

28:54.367 --> 28:56.968
No.

28:59.240 --> 29:01.840
Did you see your face?

29:01.842 --> 29:04.109
You nearly shit your pants,
homes.

29:04.111 --> 29:05.977
Hey, look.
I know you're in a tight spot,

29:05.979 --> 29:08.113
stepping into
Smurf's shoes, right?

29:08.115 --> 29:10.649
But I cannot keep giving you
extensions.

29:10.651 --> 29:12.584
You understand that,
right?

29:15.122 --> 29:16.455
Good.

29:17.791 --> 29:20.025
Get this poor <i> cabron</i>
a shot and some food.

29:21.462 --> 29:25.597
Okay, compadre,
enjoy yourself.

29:31.872 --> 29:34.273
You could have just said no
to the extension.

29:34.275 --> 29:36.541
This was more fun.

29:46.920 --> 29:48.520
There's a lot
of people here.

30:24.358 --> 30:26.558
Nicky-bo-bicky,
you gotta hear this one.

30:26.560 --> 30:29.495
I call it "Boomabang."

30:29.497 --> 30:32.630
Yeah, I gotta go.
But, uh, it's so good.

30:32.632 --> 30:36.234
Vegas better be ready.

30:36.236 --> 30:37.836
Thanks for this,
by the way.

30:37.838 --> 30:41.039
Uh, yo,
where's my money?

30:41.041 --> 30:42.508
Can't you just
put it on my tab?

30:42.510 --> 30:44.442
Well,
your tab's over a grand.

30:44.444 --> 30:46.311
That makes it $1,500.

30:46.313 --> 30:48.780
I know,
but I don't have it right now.

30:48.782 --> 30:51.383
Then we got a problem.

30:51.385 --> 30:54.520
Come on, Dylan.

30:54.522 --> 30:55.987
You can trust me.

30:55.989 --> 30:58.123
I love chicks, man.

30:58.125 --> 31:01.827
Always acting like we're friends
so you can pull shit like this.

31:04.331 --> 31:06.798
Aren't you even gonna ask
to take my beats to your party?

31:06.800 --> 31:09.835
Oh, it's not
that kinda party.

31:11.872 --> 31:13.739
Right.

31:13.741 --> 31:17.275
So, uh, check it.

31:17.277 --> 31:19.277
I want my money.

31:19.279 --> 31:21.679
Or you can suck my dick.

31:23.150 --> 31:25.016
Wait.
Do you mean literally?

31:25.018 --> 31:27.419
Yes.
Wait.

31:27.421 --> 31:30.688
You think I'm that kind of girl
who gives blow jobs for drugs?

31:31.759 --> 31:34.560
Yeah.

31:34.562 --> 31:36.628
Okay, well,
you can keep this.

31:36.630 --> 31:39.898
I'm outta here, so...
Uh-huh. No, no.

31:39.900 --> 31:42.500
You still owe me.

31:42.502 --> 31:45.503
Okay, you know, Dylan,
let me go, okay?

31:45.505 --> 31:46.372
You can just let me...

31:46.374 --> 31:47.906
No, no.

31:47.908 --> 31:49.575
You're not going anywhere

31:49.577 --> 31:51.643
until you either pay me...

31:52.980 --> 31:54.980
...or you blow me, bitch.

32:23.543 --> 32:25.944
Oh, shit.

32:25.946 --> 32:27.212
It's Nicky.

32:27.214 --> 32:29.347
She's in trouble
with some dealer.

32:31.551 --> 32:33.752
She a junkie
like your mom?

32:33.754 --> 32:35.621
No.

32:35.623 --> 32:37.088
I gotta go get her.

32:41.629 --> 32:43.495
Could you drive me?
Where?

32:43.497 --> 32:45.363
Off, like,
Hacienda and Emerald.

32:45.365 --> 32:46.898
That's over by In-N-Out,
right?

32:46.900 --> 32:47.966
Yeah.

32:47.968 --> 32:49.635
Sure.

33:01.449 --> 33:04.116
Dude, just go.

33:04.118 --> 33:05.984
She'll be here any minute.

33:05.986 --> 33:07.152
Okay.

33:09.256 --> 33:10.522
Do you have
an insurance card?

33:13.794 --> 33:15.593
No.

33:15.595 --> 33:16.995
Don't lose that.

33:16.997 --> 33:19.531
This is still paid for, right?
J hasn't dropped the ball?

33:19.533 --> 33:20.932
Better not have.

33:20.934 --> 33:23.535
Hey.
What happened?

33:23.537 --> 33:25.337
Uh, just a collection.

33:25.339 --> 33:28.606
Shit got a little bit,
uh, messy.

33:28.608 --> 33:30.075
Doctor hasn't
seen him yet.

33:30.077 --> 33:31.677
Apparently,
a dislocated shoulder

33:31.679 --> 33:34.146
isn't high
on the priority list.

33:34.148 --> 33:35.547
They gave him a Perc
for the pain.

33:35.549 --> 33:37.683
Which still hasn't
kicked in yet.

33:37.685 --> 33:40.886
Speaking of, you got anything
stronger, babe?

33:40.888 --> 33:42.754
Uh,
maybe in the car.

33:42.756 --> 33:45.491
Here's our insurance card.
I'm gonna need that back.

33:45.493 --> 33:47.625
Yeah.
I gotta go. You good?

33:47.627 --> 33:49.461
Of course, no worries.
Okay, thanks.

33:51.098 --> 33:53.365
Oh, shit.

33:53.367 --> 33:54.632
Jesus.

33:54.634 --> 33:56.502
It's... It's nothing.

33:59.639 --> 34:04.510
So, this is 240 bucks.

34:04.512 --> 34:06.845
Now,
I know it's not enough,

34:06.847 --> 34:08.147
but I'm good for the rest.

34:09.850 --> 34:10.916
What's it for?

34:10.918 --> 34:12.717
The rent.

34:12.719 --> 34:13.686
Haven't you signed
the lease yet?

34:15.455 --> 34:18.255
Oh.

34:18.257 --> 34:21.393
Babe, I'm getting the new place
with Jennifer.

34:24.598 --> 34:27.399
Oh.
Yeah, Jennifer.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.202
Come on, Craig.

34:30.204 --> 34:32.938
Neither of us is exactly
the living-together type.

34:32.940 --> 34:34.005
You know?

34:34.007 --> 34:35.940
Yeah.

34:35.943 --> 34:38.009
I guess.

34:38.011 --> 34:39.476
Hey, uh,

34:39.478 --> 34:42.013
you're still welcome to come
over whenever you want, but...

34:42.014 --> 34:44.349
No.

34:44.351 --> 34:45.684
I get it.

34:48.822 --> 34:50.089
The doctor's
ready for you.

34:52.159 --> 34:53.158
Great.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.492
Want me to come with you?

34:54.494 --> 34:56.228
Nah. Nah, just chill.

35:17.051 --> 35:19.117
Up against the wall.

35:19.119 --> 35:21.253
Follow the line.

35:25.725 --> 35:27.325
Trujillo know about this?

35:27.327 --> 35:29.595
Any reason why she should?

35:29.597 --> 35:31.196
Not from me.

35:48.415 --> 35:49.615
This asshole, he wouldn't let me
leave, and I...

35:49.617 --> 35:51.216
Shut up.

35:54.422 --> 35:55.753
Yo, you got my money?

35:55.755 --> 35:58.290
No, but I'm good for it.
Come on. Let's go.

35:58.292 --> 36:00.492
She said you had
my money.

36:00.494 --> 36:01.827
So either pay me
right now

36:01.829 --> 36:05.164
or have a seat and watch
your girl suck my dick.

36:08.035 --> 36:10.368
I'll get you your money.
You have my word.

36:10.370 --> 36:11.369
I don't know you.

36:11.371 --> 36:12.371
Yes, you do.

36:16.243 --> 36:20.045
What's your name?
J. Cody.

36:20.047 --> 36:22.714
You related to Pope?
He's my uncle.

36:26.520 --> 36:28.053
Let's go, Nicky.

36:30.124 --> 36:31.589
I can't believe that guy.

36:31.591 --> 36:33.058
You should have given me
some real money

36:33.060 --> 36:35.060
so I could have gone
to those guys in La Jolla.

36:44.938 --> 36:46.404
You know, the non-psycho guys
that don't...

36:46.406 --> 36:47.739
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:47.741 --> 36:49.941
She took my coke. She took...
She took my coke, okay?

36:54.815 --> 36:57.349
Jesus Christ.

36:57.351 --> 36:59.051
Okay, okay.

37:01.955 --> 37:03.822
Hey, I'm Nicky.

37:03.824 --> 37:05.090
I know.

37:07.895 --> 37:09.895
- Did you get your homework done?
- Mm-hmm.

37:09.897 --> 37:11.296
Really?

37:11.298 --> 37:13.631
There he is.

37:13.633 --> 37:15.633
Sit right there.

37:15.635 --> 37:17.703
Hey.

37:17.705 --> 37:20.638
- Hey, Lena.
- Lena, you want a soda?

37:20.640 --> 37:21.674
We gotta talk.

37:25.112 --> 37:28.046
What's up?

37:28.048 --> 37:30.648
You and Craig aren't answering
your phones.

37:30.650 --> 37:32.117
We were at the ER.

37:32.119 --> 37:33.785
He blew his shoulder
out again.

37:33.787 --> 37:34.986
Is he okay?

37:34.988 --> 37:36.788
Yeah, he'll be fine.

37:42.330 --> 37:43.862
J's got a job.

37:43.864 --> 37:46.165
I checked it out.
It's solid.

37:48.202 --> 37:49.134
No, thanks. I'm good.

37:49.136 --> 37:50.736
Oh, right. That's right.
I forgot.

37:50.738 --> 37:53.071
You're good.
You're great.

37:53.073 --> 37:55.273
You're great, man,
with your new haircut

37:55.275 --> 37:57.743
and your bar and your jobs
and your crew.

37:57.745 --> 37:59.277
What is that about,
anyways?

37:59.279 --> 38:01.679
Didn't you buy this place
so you could go legit?

38:01.681 --> 38:03.815
Yeah, I bought this place
because I have my own life.

38:03.817 --> 38:05.083
Okay.
I had to make my own decisions.

38:05.085 --> 38:07.285
Okay!
What about the rest of us?

38:07.287 --> 38:10.789
We need money, or we could lose
everything we've built.

38:16.163 --> 38:18.096
Okay.
I'll pay in 25K.

38:18.098 --> 38:20.232
No.
We don't need your money.

38:20.234 --> 38:22.100
We need a fourth man.

38:22.102 --> 38:23.168
And why is that
my problem?

38:23.170 --> 38:24.970
Because we're a family,
remember?

38:24.972 --> 38:27.038
We're a family?

38:27.040 --> 38:29.507
Smurf is in jail.
Baz is dead.

38:29.509 --> 38:30.842
You're taking care of Lena
all the time.

38:30.844 --> 38:32.177
We're not a family right now,
Pope.

38:32.179 --> 38:34.580
So... So shit goes sideways,
and instead of coming together,

38:34.582 --> 38:36.915
we fall apart.
Is that what you think?

38:39.453 --> 38:41.053
We are a family.

38:41.055 --> 38:43.188
And you're in it.

38:43.190 --> 38:45.657
So step the hell up.

39:08.248 --> 39:09.915
Jesus,
those things stink.

39:09.917 --> 39:11.917
Yeah, that's the point.

39:15.255 --> 39:19.791
Love... the extra "E."

39:19.793 --> 39:23.128
Classy. Yeah.
Hey, you still up for this?

39:23.130 --> 39:24.930
You know I could still kick
your ass with one arm, right?

39:26.934 --> 39:28.734
Whoo!

39:41.281 --> 39:42.680
Whoo!

39:46.286 --> 39:48.086
Useful piece of artwork.

39:54.494 --> 39:55.961
Whoo!

39:55.963 --> 39:58.197
Can't see anyone
buying these condos now.

39:59.967 --> 40:02.500
Wait a minute.

40:02.502 --> 40:05.571
This isn't where
the tamale place used to be.

40:05.573 --> 40:08.306
The tamale place
used to be on Nautilus.

40:08.308 --> 40:10.308
What is this?

40:10.310 --> 40:12.578
That little house
with the hot sisters.

40:12.580 --> 40:14.380
Remember?

40:14.382 --> 40:16.148
Baz had 'em both
in high school.

40:18.518 --> 40:20.219
Oh, yeah.

40:24.124 --> 40:25.691
You think we'll ever find out
who shot him?

40:27.795 --> 40:29.862
I don't know, man.

40:35.803 --> 40:39.271
Hey, you and Renn
find a place yet?

40:39.273 --> 40:40.338
Nah, man.

40:40.340 --> 40:42.540
Read that one wrong.

40:42.542 --> 40:45.877
She doesn't want
to shack up with me.

40:45.879 --> 40:47.345
I feel like a dildo.

40:47.347 --> 40:50.015
Aw, come on.
You're more than that.

40:50.017 --> 40:51.750
You're a giant dildo.

40:51.752 --> 40:54.219
You should just stay
at Smurf's, man.

40:54.221 --> 40:56.422
It's not like she's using it.
She may never get out.

40:56.424 --> 40:58.957
Man, that would be wild.

41:01.361 --> 41:03.295
Shall we finish this shit?

41:03.297 --> 41:04.896
Hell, yeah.

41:09.236 --> 41:10.702
Ahh.

41:14.374 --> 41:15.507
That's a fine job.

41:15.509 --> 41:17.175
Mm-hmm.

41:19.779 --> 41:20.846
J, come out.

41:20.848 --> 41:23.381
Everybody wants
to say hi to you.

41:23.383 --> 41:25.917
I was telling them how you
saved me earlier.

41:25.919 --> 41:27.252
You shouldn't
be talking about that.

41:27.254 --> 41:30.122
Okay, fine.

41:30.124 --> 41:33.191
Well, I always knew that you
would come and take care of me.

41:36.063 --> 41:38.464
My hero.

41:38.466 --> 41:43.001
Saving me from
a $1,000 blow job.

41:43.003 --> 41:44.136
Please stop.

41:45.473 --> 41:47.205
Nicky, stop.

41:47.207 --> 41:48.606
What the hell
is wrong with you?

41:48.608 --> 41:49.675
I got shit to do.

41:49.677 --> 41:50.942
Wait, w-what's going on?

41:50.944 --> 41:53.479
I'm... I'm really sorry
about earlier, okay?

41:53.481 --> 41:55.147
I'm really sorry.

41:55.149 --> 41:56.948
You should probably
get out there.

41:56.950 --> 41:58.750
Oh, come on.

42:10.030 --> 42:12.030
How come we never hung out
in high school?

42:12.032 --> 42:16.234
'Cause you were popular,
and I was a loser.

42:16.236 --> 42:18.236
That is so not true,
Nicky.

42:18.238 --> 42:20.372
Everyone thought
you were cool.

42:40.594 --> 42:42.861
Yo, your front door's
unlocked.

42:48.202 --> 42:50.202
Not smart.

43:06.954 --> 43:07.953
Cool party.

43:07.955 --> 43:09.821
They're Nicky's friends.

43:12.159 --> 43:15.627
It's a pretty nice setup
you got here.

43:15.629 --> 43:18.363
It's not mine.
It's Smurf's.

43:18.365 --> 43:19.965
I need a place to crash.

43:19.967 --> 43:22.134
Seems like there's plenty
of beds here.

43:24.171 --> 43:26.104
Is this about
what we owe you?

43:26.106 --> 43:29.507
No.
I just need a place to chill.

43:29.509 --> 43:32.710
I'll have to ask Smurf.

43:32.712 --> 43:34.512
Smurf's in jail.

43:39.920 --> 43:42.788
I'll take the couch.

43:53.401 --> 43:55.200
Yo, this is bullshit!

43:55.202 --> 43:57.736
That stuff ain't mine!
I don't mess with that shit!

43:57.738 --> 44:00.071
I'll tellin' you.
Somebody put that there.

44:00.073 --> 44:03.341
You dried-up bitch!
I'm gonna kill you!

44:03.343 --> 44:06.812
I'm gonna kill you for this!

44:09.749 --> 44:10.949
You okay, Janine?

44:10.951 --> 44:13.018
I guess.
What happened?

44:13.020 --> 44:15.821
Contraband in her cell.
Heroin.

44:15.823 --> 44:18.690
In that balloon?
Sure is.

44:18.692 --> 44:20.292
What are they
gonna do to her now?

44:20.294 --> 44:21.693
She's moving to D-block.

44:21.695 --> 44:23.962
Isolation, no visits,

44:23.964 --> 44:25.831
and she'll get
another drug charge.

44:25.833 --> 44:27.565
Hmm.
