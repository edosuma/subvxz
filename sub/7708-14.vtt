(man on TV)
'And now, direct from his
tour of Canadian prisons'

00:06.307 --> 00:08.574
'Giggles in the valley
is very proud to present'

00:08.576 --> 00:11.543
the comedy of Larry Slotkin!

00:11.545 --> 00:12.845
Larry Slotkin!

00:12.847 --> 00:14.847
[applause]

00:16.951 --> 00:20.285
Thank you, Sid, and polyester's
definitely your color.

00:20.287 --> 00:23.055
[audience laughing]

00:23.057 --> 00:25.057
Well, I don't think so.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.458
[TV switches off]

00:26.460 --> 00:28.794
Oh, I'm sorry,
were you watching?

00:29.630 --> 00:31.263
No, we were just sitting here

00:31.265 --> 00:33.999
pretending to be throw pillows.

00:34.001 --> 00:36.502
Well, I think Kate's
doing the better job.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.372
ALF, we like this program.
We find it funny.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.041
Oh, come on!

00:42.043 --> 00:44.643
You could put anybody up
in front of prisoners

00:44.645 --> 00:46.412
and they're gonna laugh.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.614
Especially in Canada.

00:48.616 --> 00:51.517
I'm funnier than
anyone you saw tonight.

00:51.519 --> 00:53.252
No, you're not.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.586
Oh, really?

00:54.588 --> 00:57.656
A rabbi, a priest and an
atheist walk into a bar.

00:57.658 --> 00:58.757
You're funny, you're funny.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.393
Just don't tell that joke again.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.262
ALF, friends will
say you're funny

01:03.264 --> 01:05.597
even when you're really
not, as you just witnessed.

01:05.599 --> 01:08.767
Now, being a comedian takes
years of hard work

01:08.769 --> 01:11.570
and-and personal sacrifice.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.173
Well, I don't know
about sacrifice.

01:14.175 --> 01:18.143
But I've never been one to
shy away from hard work.

01:18.145 --> 01:21.213
(Both)
Ha ha ha ha.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.549
See? Made you laugh!

01:24.685 --> 01:27.886
[theme music]

[keys clacking]

02:31.218 --> 02:32.351
Ha ha ha!

02:32.353 --> 02:34.720
ALF! It's 1:00 in the morning!

02:34.722 --> 02:35.988
Not now, not now.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.590
Are you gonna type all night?

02:38.592 --> 02:39.892
Look, while you're here,

02:39.894 --> 02:42.194
let me run some
very hip jokes by you.

02:42.196 --> 02:45.597
When I'm done, there won't
be a dry seat in the house.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.935
There's a challenge I
never thought I'd face.

02:49.937 --> 02:52.905
Okay, let's get this over with.

02:52.907 --> 02:55.908
Good, you're psyched.

02:55.910 --> 03:00.345
Anyone here ever been
to a fast-food restaurant?

03:00.347 --> 03:02.881
On Melmac, they were the worst.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.617
You'd ask for extra crispy.

03:05.619 --> 03:08.554
They'd bring you a
cat with arthritis!

03:08.556 --> 03:11.323
Ha ha ha!

03:11.325 --> 03:14.693
ALF, take my advice.
Don't quit your day job.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.696
Which, in your case,
is just an expression.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.333
Aah.

03:21.335 --> 03:24.102
Like he knows
anything about comedy.

03:24.104 --> 03:28.173
Mr. "Oh, here's a
humorous paradox

03:28.175 --> 03:30.842
I read about in
"Scientific American"."

03:32.346 --> 03:35.214
I'm funny. I am.

03:35.216 --> 03:37.149
I could be a comic.

03:37.151 --> 03:38.684
I am funny.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.052
<i> I really am!</i>

03:40.054 --> 03:41.787
Hey, does anyone want
to hear a good gag?

03:41.789 --> 03:43.288
(audience)
Yeah!

03:43.290 --> 03:44.923
[gags]

03:44.925 --> 03:46.992
[audience groans]

03:46.994 --> 03:48.927
'I just bought a new car..'

03:48.929 --> 03:50.996
'It's not really new,
it's an old U.P.S. Truck.'

03:50.998 --> 03:52.931
Hi! I'm ALF.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.267
Stand-up comic extraordinaire.

03:55.269 --> 03:58.370
I go on right
before the fat guy.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.239
Whoops.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.107
My name's Howie Anderson.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.978
I sweat when I get nervous.

04:05.980 --> 04:08.380
I hope the stage
has good drainage.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.917
This is my first time
getting up there.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.518
I'm really nervous.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.121
You're not gonna faint, are you?

04:16.123 --> 04:18.357
I know you're just
starting out, too.

04:18.359 --> 04:22.628
But I can tell, you have star
quality written all over you.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.763
Any suggestions you can give me?

04:24.765 --> 04:26.832
Well, if I were you, babe.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.768
I'd use that weight
thing in my act.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.770
The weight thing.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.006
Yeah, that might work.

04:34.008 --> 04:34.873
Thanks.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.475
Ah, don't mention it.

04:36.477 --> 04:37.809
You're lucky.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.978
I don't have any
physical characteristics

04:39.980 --> 04:42.047
I could play off of.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.983
Okay, right now, I'd like you

04:44.985 --> 04:47.886
to give a very warm Giggles
welcome to a newcomer.

04:47.888 --> 04:52.157
He goes by the name of
Gordon ALF Shumway.

04:52.159 --> 04:53.292
[chuckles]

04:53.294 --> 04:56.295
[applause]

04:57.965 --> 04:59.398
- Thank you, Sid.
- Yeah.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.167
Just don't stink up the joint.

05:02.169 --> 05:06.438
So, anyone here ever been
to a fast food restaurant?

05:06.440 --> 05:08.740
On Melmac, they were the worst.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.375
You'd ask for extra crispy.

05:10.377 --> 05:12.844
They'd give you a
cat with arthritis!

05:12.846 --> 05:15.447
[audience laughing]

05:17.084 --> 05:20.352
You hear about the Melmacian
National Library burning down?

05:20.354 --> 05:23.121
They lost both books!

05:23.123 --> 05:25.624
And the second one
wasn't even colored in yet!

05:25.626 --> 05:26.925
Ha ha!

05:26.927 --> 05:29.127
[audience laughs and applauds]

05:31.398 --> 05:33.932
I'll tell you,
women...am I right?

05:33.934 --> 05:35.934
'Take my girlfriend, Rhonda.'

05:35.936 --> 05:38.136
I could always tell
when she was mad

05:38.138 --> 05:41.139
by the way the fur on
her back would stand up.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.041
Ha ha! Oh!

05:43.043 --> 05:45.210
[audience laughing]

05:45.212 --> 05:47.279
[laughing]
I've got to stop you.

05:47.281 --> 05:49.848
I mean, I've been running
comedy clubs forever.

05:49.850 --> 05:53.452
But you have redefined
comedy in America.

05:53.454 --> 05:56.455
[applause]

05:58.559 --> 06:00.992
Before we get back to your act,
there's somebody over here

06:00.994 --> 06:02.828
who is dying to meet you.

06:02.830 --> 06:06.298
Brandon Tartikoff! In my club!

06:07.668 --> 06:08.900
Hi.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.802
- Brandon who?
- Brandon Tartikoff.

06:10.804 --> 06:13.004
I'm head of programming at NBC.

06:13.006 --> 06:16.041
Yeah, uh, Brandon,
people are waiting.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.643
Alright, alright, alright.
I'll-I'll cut to the chase.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.011
You're a funny guy.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.046
We'd like to give you your own

06:21.048 --> 06:23.715
prime-time sitcom to star in.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.984
Gee, I don't know. TV?

06:25.986 --> 06:28.387
I always thought
my future was in film.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.857
So-so did Shelley Long.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.493
Listen, ALF, we'll give
you almost anything

06:34.495 --> 06:36.194
to get you on NBC.

06:36.196 --> 06:39.064
Frankly, uh, we're desperate.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.099
Hey, you don't
have to convince me.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.101
I saw "Nutt House"!

06:43.103 --> 06:45.237
(Audience)
'Ohh!'

06:45.239 --> 06:47.939
So what do you say?
Are you in or out?

06:47.941 --> 06:51.276
Out. And next time,
go through my agent.

06:51.278 --> 06:54.613
You've been in the business long
enough to know how it works.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.548
You're right. I-I'm sorry.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.383
I-I overstepped.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.652
Hey. How did he slip in?

07:00.654 --> 07:03.388
Who's watching the door?

07:03.390 --> 07:04.990
Come on, guys!

07:06.427 --> 07:07.926
ALF, you were wonderful!

07:07.928 --> 07:10.028
I had to dig my
nails into my chair

07:10.030 --> 07:12.964
to keep from laughing out loud!

07:12.966 --> 07:16.401
Willie, one day you're
going to explode.

07:16.403 --> 07:18.336
[everyone laughs]

07:18.338 --> 07:22.707
ALF, you really did
redefine comedy in America.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.309
I can't believe I doubted you.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.011
I mean, I am wrong
a lot of the time.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.547
But pff, I outdid myself here.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.848
It's okay.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.117
I don't expect that
much from you.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.486
[everyone laughs]

07:34.488 --> 07:38.089
Oh, ALF? Um, could you
start hanging out with me?

07:38.091 --> 07:41.126
That way, I could be
popular with the cool kids.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.062
Depends. What's in it for me?

07:44.064 --> 07:46.531
The knowledge you'd
be making them happy?

07:48.001 --> 07:49.668
No, really.

07:49.670 --> 07:50.802
Oh!

07:50.804 --> 07:51.837
[everyone laughs]

07:51.839 --> 07:53.071
Oh!

07:55.142 --> 07:58.343
[instrumental music]

08:11.825 --> 08:14.326
[telephone rings]

08:14.328 --> 08:16.628
This one's from a man in Texas.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.930
He calls you a genius four times

08:18.932 --> 08:20.632
and that's just on the envelope.

08:20.634 --> 08:23.235
Check it for money,
then throw it away.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.172
The people from "Charles in
Charge" are on the phone, sir.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.206
They'd like to know
if you'd like to be

08:28.208 --> 08:29.908
a regular on that show.

08:29.910 --> 08:34.179
Tell 'em if they dump Scott
Baio and call it "ALF in Charge"

08:34.181 --> 08:36.681
I'll think about it.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.550
Right. Thank you, Mr. ALF, sir.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.152
Barbara Walters needs an answer.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.488
Are you going to do her
Academy Award night special?

08:43.490 --> 08:45.156
Am I the only guest?

08:45.158 --> 08:48.627
No. Marlon Brando and Margaret
Thatcher will be on, too.

08:48.629 --> 08:49.995
Pass.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.329
[doorbell rings]

08:51.331 --> 08:56.034
When will it all stop?
I need my rest!

08:56.036 --> 08:58.003
ALF, do we have to
go into the kitchen?

08:58.005 --> 09:00.839
You know the rules, son.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.974
It's Mrs. Ochmonek.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.209
Stay!

09:06.246 --> 09:07.712
Where have you been keeping him?

09:07.714 --> 09:09.981
[gasps]
There he is! Oh!

09:09.983 --> 09:12.918
[laughs]

09:12.920 --> 09:14.786
I laugh just looking at you.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.054
Yeah, same back at you.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.089
Oh! Ho ho ho!

09:18.091 --> 09:20.258
Mr. Shumway, would you
be willing to come over

09:20.260 --> 09:23.094
and meet my bridge
club? They all adore you.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.564
Look, any other time,
I would have said "yes."

09:25.566 --> 09:27.465
But I have a life now.

09:27.467 --> 09:30.235
Oh! Ha ha ha!

09:30.237 --> 09:32.637
I love this funny man.

09:32.639 --> 09:36.007
Well, would you at least
autograph a picture for me?

09:36.009 --> 09:37.709
Brian!

09:37.711 --> 09:40.078
I don't do my own autographs.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.147
But I will touch the photo.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.719
Well, I'd better get back.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.988
Thank you, Mr. Shumway.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.256
Yeah. You're welcome.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.924
Check her for money
and get her out of here.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.492
Ha ha ha!

09:54.494 --> 09:58.029
He ad-libbed for me!
Oh, ho ho ho!

09:58.031 --> 10:01.266
Oh, I hope to see you around.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.335
Save me a fur ball.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.671
Well, I'm off to the track.

10:06.673 --> 10:10.041
I thought I'd fritter away
some more of my money.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.643
Ha ha ha ha!

10:11.645 --> 10:14.446
But what about the, uh,
lifetime achievement award

10:14.448 --> 10:16.214
you're being given tonight?

10:16.216 --> 10:18.683
Shouldn't you be working
on your acceptance speech?

10:18.685 --> 10:20.285
I'll wing it.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.288
Oh, and sorry I didn't
invite you to the ceremony.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.625
But you know why that is.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.827
Because once, we
said you weren't funny.

10:30.564 --> 10:32.097
That's right.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.899
Now, you know where you belong.

10:34.901 --> 10:36.334
(both)
The attic.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.339
And don't touch my things!

10:45.045 --> 10:48.246
[instrumental music]

10:50.917 --> 10:53.518
[applause]

10:54.454 --> 10:57.288
Thank you. Thank you very much.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.557
Tonight, the people's
choice awards

10:59.559 --> 11:02.961
has chosen to honor a
man who has revolutionized

11:02.963 --> 11:04.596
the field of comedy.

11:04.598 --> 11:07.465
Gordon "ALF" Shumway
has been responsible

11:07.467 --> 11:10.602
for a body of work
stretching back to Monday.

11:12.406 --> 11:15.907
Unfortunately, Gordon is
running just a little bit late.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.976
But he did call in on
his car phone, and--

11:17.978 --> 11:19.744
[drum roll]

11:19.746 --> 11:23.348
Ah, we've just received
word Gordon is in the building.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.151
[audience applauds]

11:26.153 --> 11:29.354
[fanfare plays]

11:31.291 --> 11:33.458
Thank you! Thank you!

11:33.460 --> 11:36.594
So, how's life after Bandstand?

11:36.596 --> 11:39.030
I'm afraid you have me
confused with somebody else.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.799
Oh, I'm so sorry.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.802
Don Cornelius, ladies
and gentlemen, huh?

11:43.804 --> 11:45.136
Ha ha!

11:45.839 --> 11:47.138
Go sit down, will you?

11:47.140 --> 11:48.740
Get out of here.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.544
Look, I'm not a speech maker.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.512
I'm a beloved entertainer.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.981
So I'm gonna do what I do best

11:56.983 --> 11:58.817
and tell a few jokes.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.785
[applause]

12:00.787 --> 12:04.956
Anyone here ever been
to a fast food restaurant?

12:04.958 --> 12:07.392
On Melmac, they were the worst!

12:07.394 --> 12:09.194
You'd ask for extra crispy.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.863
They'd give you a
cat with arthritis!

12:11.865 --> 12:13.131
Yadda yadda bing bing!

12:13.133 --> 12:15.667
[audience laughs]

12:15.669 --> 12:17.035
(male #1)
'Hey, Gordon!'

12:17.037 --> 12:19.070
'Let's hear some new stuff!'

12:19.072 --> 12:20.538
New stuff?

12:20.540 --> 12:22.540
'Yeah, like stuff you
haven't done before!'

12:22.542 --> 12:23.775
(audience)
'Yeah! Yeah!'

12:23.777 --> 12:25.543
Oh, oh, oh, new stuff!

12:25.545 --> 12:27.946
Oh, sure! Uh, did you hear about

12:27.948 --> 12:31.349
the Melmacian National
Library burning down?

12:31.351 --> 12:34.652
(audience)
'Yeah, they lost both books.'

12:34.654 --> 12:37.455
[audience boos]

12:37.457 --> 12:40.391
Okay, okay, stop me
if you heard this one.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.594
(audience)
'Stop! Stop!'

12:49.236 --> 12:51.069
That's what I get for
giving this business

12:51.071 --> 12:53.338
the three best days of my life.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.572
[audience boos]

12:54.574 --> 12:55.607
Ingrates!

12:59.379 --> 13:01.846
[instrumental music]

13:17.964 --> 13:21.699
Just tell Ms. Walters I'm
ready to do her show now.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.636
The name's ALF.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.906
A-L-F.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.811
Well, I was really big
a couple of days ago.

13:34.681 --> 13:37.615
You know as well as I do
it's never gonna freeze over!

13:39.686 --> 13:43.822
Is it just me, or did my
career fizzle all of a sudden?

13:43.824 --> 13:45.623
ALF, Woody Allen called.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.625
He said that you confirmed

13:47.627 --> 13:49.961
everything he thought
about television.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.330
Really?

13:52.332 --> 13:55.200
He said that about me?

13:55.202 --> 13:58.236
Let it go. You're washed up.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.839
No! I can't be washed up!

14:00.841 --> 14:02.540
Not yet!

14:02.542 --> 14:04.209
ALF, is it possible
that your fame

14:04.211 --> 14:06.144
lasted as long as
it was supposed to?

14:06.146 --> 14:10.415
Andy Warhol said that everyone
would be famous for 15 minutes.

14:10.417 --> 14:13.651
Well, I want more
than 15 minutes!

14:13.653 --> 14:16.988
I deserve at least as much
time as Gavin Macleod got.

14:18.325 --> 14:21.526
[instrumental music]

14:38.845 --> 14:40.545
[Rudolph sputters]

14:41.948 --> 14:43.081
Got it!

14:48.588 --> 14:50.221
Uh, time's up! Time's up!

14:50.223 --> 14:52.557
[plates shatter]

14:54.995 --> 14:57.262
[audience claps]

14:57.264 --> 14:58.296
Alright, alright.

14:58.298 --> 14:59.364
Don't encourage him.

14:59.366 --> 15:00.765
He'll come back.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.434
[coughs]

15:05.171 --> 15:07.739
Alright, I have a couple
of announcements to make.

15:07.741 --> 15:11.209
Bingo starts at
7 o'clock, not 6:00.

15:11.211 --> 15:14.646
Also, whoever's been
taking the "F" from my name

15:14.648 --> 15:16.080
better knock it off.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.449
It's "ALF," not "AL."

15:19.886 --> 15:23.554
So, anyone here ever been
to a fast food restaurant?

15:23.556 --> 15:25.657
On Melmac, they were the worst.

15:25.659 --> 15:27.292
You'd ask for extra crispy,
they'd give you

15:27.294 --> 15:29.494
a cat with arthritis.
No problem.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.535
Alright, folks.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.071
Gonna step out of
character for a second here

15:40.073 --> 15:41.806
and explain something.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.274
These are jokes.

15:43.276 --> 15:47.445
They were funny ten years
ago, they're funny now.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.114
So it wouldn't
kill you to laugh.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.649
Now back to the routine.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.252
Did you hear about the
Melmacian National Library?

15:54.254 --> 15:56.421
[blender whirs]

15:56.423 --> 15:58.456
Hey, hey! Hey, bartender!

15:58.458 --> 16:01.726
Excuse me! I'm in
the middle of my act!

16:01.728 --> 16:04.762
How many people would
rather listen to the blender?

16:04.764 --> 16:07.966
[audience laughing
and applauding]

16:09.135 --> 16:11.469
And where's my wife's margarita?

16:11.471 --> 16:14.472
Hey. When I'm finished,
I'll bring her a trough.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.509
What's that supposed to mean?

16:18.511 --> 16:22.113
[sighs]
It's a joke!

16:22.115 --> 16:25.583
Am I the only one in this room
who understands comedy?

16:25.585 --> 16:27.986
Are you trying to be funny?

16:27.988 --> 16:29.754
I knew you wouldn't
get this stuff.

16:29.756 --> 16:32.156
You barely understood
the buffet table.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.792
That's it.

16:34.794 --> 16:37.795
I'm gonna take that
microphone and I'm gonna--

16:37.797 --> 16:41.199
Hey! If there's any fighting in
here, I'm gonna throw you out!

16:41.201 --> 16:42.500
You tell him!

16:42.502 --> 16:44.569
I'm talking to you, Shumway!

16:46.873 --> 16:49.540
Go by table four and
clean up the vomit.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.442
Hey, Mr. Polniakoff.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.845
There are certain
things I won't do.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.247
Well, then, you're fired!

16:56.249 --> 16:59.150
However, cleaning up
vomit is not one of them.

17:00.954 --> 17:04.322
Hey, here's Howie Anderson,
the comedian!

17:04.324 --> 17:05.857
Ha! How-ie!

17:05.859 --> 17:07.792
(audience)
How-ie! How-ie!

17:07.794 --> 17:09.861
Oh, like I need this.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.196
Hey, tell some jokes, Howie.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.532
- Oh, I just dropped by.
- Ahh..

17:14.534 --> 17:16.300
Well, I wasn't
planning to perform.

17:16.302 --> 17:17.668
- But if you insist..
- Ha!

17:17.670 --> 17:19.871
(audience)
Yay! Yeah!

17:24.077 --> 17:26.577
Well. Now, I have an
aerobics class in the morning

17:26.579 --> 17:27.612
so let's get this over with.

17:27.614 --> 17:28.980
[audience laughs]

17:28.982 --> 17:31.115
No, actually, I don't
have time for aerobics.

17:31.117 --> 17:32.617
I have hobbies.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.252
I like to go to
all-you-can-eat buffets.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.554
That's one of my hobbies.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.189
Oh, not for the food.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.858
I go to horrify the management.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.560
'Cause I'm there
for about five minutes

17:42.562 --> 17:43.728
and they look at me like
I'm gonna eat the

17:43.730 --> 17:45.730
whole restaurant for $5.99.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.765
[audience laughs]

17:47.767 --> 17:49.434
If that's the way
they feel, that's fine.

17:49.436 --> 17:53.604
Now I go in, I kick down the
door and go "I'm starving!"

17:53.606 --> 17:55.940
"I'm starving!"

17:55.942 --> 17:59.177
Yeah? I could get laughs, too.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.279
If I were fat.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.614
I recognize that bitter voice.

18:03.616 --> 18:04.916
Do I know you?

18:04.918 --> 18:07.652
No. I just look
like a lot of people.

18:08.955 --> 18:10.321
You're ALF!

18:10.323 --> 18:12.090
We started out together.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.692
Comedians everywhere
owe him a debt.

18:14.694 --> 18:18.296
When we're tired, lazy, cocky..

18:18.298 --> 18:19.630
...we ask ourselves..

18:19.632 --> 18:21.632
..."Do we wanna
end up like ALF?"

18:21.634 --> 18:23.568
And we snap right out of it.

18:23.570 --> 18:24.602
Thank you, ALF.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.805
[audience laughs]

18:28.708 --> 18:30.308
Ahh, shut up.

18:34.347 --> 18:37.548
[instrumental music]

18:43.823 --> 18:44.856
Ohh.

18:47.994 --> 18:51.095
Maybe he knows where ALF is.

18:51.097 --> 18:53.564
Excuse me, old-timer..

18:53.566 --> 18:56.334
Hey. What are you doing here?

18:56.336 --> 18:58.703
ALF, I can't believe it!

18:58.705 --> 19:00.538
It's been ten years.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.540
How you been?

19:02.542 --> 19:04.308
[spits]
Uh, fine.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.544
Couldn't be better.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.279
ALF..

19:08.281 --> 19:09.647
Oh, this?

19:09.649 --> 19:11.949
This is a new comedy
bit I'm working on.

19:11.951 --> 19:15.553
Watch! It's a spit take.
It'll be funny!

19:15.555 --> 19:16.787
No, no.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.322
It's alright.

19:18.324 --> 19:21.058
We know you've been working
here for the last ten years.

19:21.060 --> 19:24.228
How come you
never called us, ALF?

19:24.230 --> 19:25.830
I was too proud.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.699
And after Lynn
became a studio head

19:28.701 --> 19:31.903
and Brian got
his own TV series..

19:31.905 --> 19:33.304
...thought you'd
think I was calling

19:33.306 --> 19:34.705
because I wanted something.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.408
No, no, we wouldn't
have thought that.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.676
Really?

19:38.678 --> 19:39.977
Hey, Bri!

19:39.979 --> 19:43.247
Can I have a guest
shot on your series?

19:43.249 --> 19:45.750
It's not up to me, Al.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.685
It's "ALF," Brian.

19:48.821 --> 19:52.190
Call the casting
person on my show.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.559
But if you want your old
room back, ALF, you're always--

19:54.561 --> 19:56.861
Not now, Willie.

19:56.863 --> 20:00.765
Hey, I've been hearing a lot
about M.G.M.-Lynn studios.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.433
Congratulations.

20:02.435 --> 20:06.037
Thank you. It just feels good
to get out of the steno pool.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.640
You think you can get me a film?

20:09.642 --> 20:12.977
I mean, John Candy must
turn down something.

20:14.614 --> 20:17.281
No, actually, he doesn't.

20:17.283 --> 20:18.316
Sorry.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.486
Eric!

20:22.488 --> 20:23.788
Where's Eric?

20:23.790 --> 20:26.824
Eric...well, Eric
has been pretty busy

20:26.826 --> 20:28.492
since he replaced
Scott Baio on--

20:28.494 --> 20:29.560
No!

20:29.562 --> 20:31.996
Don't even finish that sentence!

20:31.998 --> 20:34.031
[sighs]
That's it.

20:34.033 --> 20:38.636
Willie...what were you saying
about my room being ready?

20:38.638 --> 20:40.771
If you'd like your
old room back, ALF

20:40.773 --> 20:42.873
we'd like to have you.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.910
Oh, you mean that, palomino?

20:45.912 --> 20:47.612
Let's go home, ALF.

20:47.614 --> 20:48.846
(Polniakoff)
'Shumway!'

20:50.550 --> 20:52.717
Where do you think you're going?

20:52.719 --> 20:55.786
I'm going back to the
San Fernando valley.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.122
Where people think I'm funny.

20:58.124 --> 21:01.259
(all)
We don't think you're funny.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.094
Don't be a fool!

21:03.096 --> 21:04.996
You belong here!

21:04.998 --> 21:07.198
I'll start...paying you.

21:08.234 --> 21:09.700
You will?

21:10.470 --> 21:12.069
Don't listen to him, ALF.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.871
All he's offering
is a dingy nightclub

21:13.873 --> 21:16.374
full of faded dreams
and lonely nights.

21:16.376 --> 21:19.176
And four bucks an hour.

21:19.178 --> 21:23.714
It's a dead end filled with
hopelessness and humiliation.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.783
I'll give you back your F.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.886
Don't let him tempt you, ALF.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.656
Come home with us.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.858
What, and leave show business?

21:34.694 --> 21:35.860
Ha!

21:35.862 --> 21:37.461
I think not.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.432
I was funny!

21:41.434 --> 21:42.667
I was funny!

21:42.669 --> 21:44.502
I was funny!

21:44.504 --> 21:46.003
- I was funny!
- ALF!

21:46.005 --> 21:48.572
- Oh! Wha...? Oh.
- You alright?

21:48.574 --> 21:50.041
Oh, Willie!

21:50.810 --> 21:53.444
I had a nightmare.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.446
I was a stand-up comic

21:55.448 --> 21:57.982
and I had to clean up vomit!

21:57.984 --> 22:01.819
Listen, I've decided
I don't wanna be a comedian.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.055
I hope you're not
too disappointed.

22:04.057 --> 22:06.557
Oh, we dealt with you
giving up dirty dancing.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.559
I think we can deal with this.

22:08.561 --> 22:09.794
Thanks.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.463
I just realized..

22:12.465 --> 22:14.799
...I'm too pretty to be funny.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.867
I envy you, Kate.

22:18.237 --> 22:20.438
Thanks, AL.

22:21.341 --> 22:22.440
What?

22:22.442 --> 22:24.041
You heard me.

22:25.244 --> 22:27.411
Breakfast will be
ready in 15 minutes.

22:27.413 --> 22:31.649
Because you must be
"Starving! Starving!"

22:31.651 --> 22:33.351
Aah! Aah!

22:33.353 --> 22:36.754
Hurry up, because
"Eric in Charge" is on.

22:36.756 --> 22:39.957
No!
