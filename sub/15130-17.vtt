Well, all righty then.

My only advice to you

Alex, hey.
Can I talk to you?

00:57.458 --> 01:00.692
I have a consult
in emerg.

Oh, uh, okay, later on then,

01:02.663 --> 01:04.463
Um, I've got
some really good news.

Suffering from
severe abdominal pains.

Stable.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.684
Anyone come in
with her?

01:25.686 --> 01:27.653
Don't think so.
What did you give her?

01:27.655 --> 01:29.354
Couple milligrams
of lorazepam.

01:29.356 --> 01:31.657
She was pretty panicky
when they brought her in.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.258
Great. Thanks.

Mrs. Pernice?

Oh,
I'm getting old.

01:37.498 --> 01:38.664
That's what
the problem is.

I never should have cut out
cigarettes.

I just need to feel your belly,
if that's okay.

01:45.406 --> 01:46.405
Yeah.
Of course.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.873
I-I don't know
what happened.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.808
I was taking
my morning coffee and --

01:49.810 --> 01:52.311
Oh, I was watching
that ridiculous show "the view."

01:52.313 --> 01:53.812
And all of the sudden,
I just...

Oh, agony.

We both went down.

02:02.623 --> 02:03.722
The bet is off.

Okay, we need
an impartial judge here.

Doctor? Hey!

02:06.360 --> 02:08.560
That is just rude.
Sorry.

Is there anyone
that we can call?

02:11.265 --> 02:12.898
Any family members
to contact?

I lost my husband to cancer
in March.

I'm sorry
to hear that.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.905
Thank you. 30 years.

He was a good man,
though.

Why don't you lay back?
No, actually.

Mrs. Pernice,
I-I think that if you just --

02:49.336 --> 02:51.770
I got to move.
Why don't you lay back down?

02:51.772 --> 02:53.172

I'd have a technician do this,

That's so sweet.

Update my facebook status

We should probably tell
my parents before you do that.

to tell his mother

Have you ever thought
about obstetrics?

the same consult.

Uh, no,
they're two different patients.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.762

That's right.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.131

of that?

While racing
over a line of parked cars.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.644
Marcel:
It was a push.

09:05.646 --> 09:06.678
Sandy:
Sucker bet.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.314
So, by racing,
you mean you were running

09:09.316 --> 09:11.216
And jumping over
parked vehicles. Is that...?

09:11.218 --> 09:13.051
Turns out it looks way easier
in the movies

in real life.

That's true.
Hmm.

do you want?

your opposite shoulder for me.

I'm just gonna check
your sensation here.

Yeah, like a mother--
okay.

Okay, I'm just gonna check
your axillary nerve function.

to breakfast,

And then sandy bet me
that I couldn't beat him

Over a line
of parked cars.
Okay.

had a wager over this stunt?

And you can't blow your nose
for at least half an hour after.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.078
Okay, if either of you
does have a fracture,

10:13.080 --> 10:14.279
You're gonna require surgery.

Before you started
playing automobile leapfrog.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.726
Okay,
we'll get you into imaging.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.661
In the meantime, gentlemen,
why don't you just rehearse

10:29.663 --> 10:32.931
Some of the more quiet scenes
from "winter's tale"?

10:45.045 --> 10:47.946
Maybe she didn't like
the look of dr. Miller.

No, she suffered a hypertensive,
hyperkinetic attack.

to be more colloquial.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.326
What do I do
about my patient?

11:01.328 --> 11:03.695
Right, um, well,
I'll send her up for a head ct,

11:03.697 --> 11:06.731
But I don't think the problem
is with her brain.

11:06.733 --> 11:08.333
Call me
when you get the results.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.670
We just opened up

out front.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.973

The fava
is the most resilient bean.

11:17.678 --> 11:20.779
Take a deep breath
for me, sara, okay?

It's known
as the meat of the poor.

it's very serious stuff.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.452
Just like sara

11:27.454 --> 11:30.055
Sara's been adamant since the
beginning of her pregnancy --

Sara:
No c-section.

Yes.

from both sides.

Very good.

12:03.156 --> 12:06.291
Okay, well, imagine you have
a very small garage,

12:06.293 --> 12:07.892
But you own a motorcycle
and a car.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.394
Now, as long
as the motorcycle is parked

12:09.396 --> 12:10.762
At the back
of the garage,

12:10.764 --> 12:12.197
You can get the car out
just fine.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.732
The motorcycle
is the placenta?

12:13.734 --> 12:16.334
But if the motorcycle's parked
at the front of the garage

12:16.336 --> 12:17.936
And you try
and get the car out --

12:17.938 --> 12:19.471
The car is the baby?
Right.

to be conservative.

I'm not.

12:33.487 --> 12:35.386

to be worried about.

Okay, so, here's what
I'm gonna do to prevent that.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.896
I'm gonna sneak in
beside this pesky placenta

13:17.898 --> 13:20.298
And I'm gonna gently dilate
the inner-uterine segment.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.367
Then I'm gonna use
the baby's head

that suits you more.

You think
it could be a pheo.

35:39.171 --> 35:40.670
So her prognosis
is very good.

35:40.672 --> 35:43.640
That is
such good news.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.142
Thank you.

35:45.144 --> 35:46.676
You're welcome.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.145
Thank you.

35:48.147 --> 35:53.817
Um, I wanted to apologize to you
for earlier.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.419
Oh,
no apology necessary.

35:56.421 --> 35:57.888
Really.

36:01.592 --> 36:05.729
Did she, uh,
mention anything to you?

36:07.698 --> 36:09.533
A little.

36:11.869 --> 36:15.739
Just that she had met you
at a party once and was smitten.

36:15.741 --> 36:17.674
[ laughs ]

36:17.676 --> 36:21.878
Well,
it was very mutual.

36:21.880 --> 36:25.549
It was supposed to be
just a one-time thing.

36:25.551 --> 36:27.250
It wasn't.

36:27.252 --> 36:31.521
The affair
lasted almost a year...

36:31.523 --> 36:34.524
Until her husband
caught us.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.860
That must have been hard.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.429
Oh,
you have no idea.

36:39.431 --> 36:45.435
Our circle of friends
and our church.

36:45.437 --> 36:51.641
Mimi just chose
to bury it and me.

36:53.678 --> 36:58.515
[ voice breaking ] and I
stayed single all these years.

37:01.485 --> 37:04.788
I just never stopped
loving her.

37:07.658 --> 37:10.727
Claire,
I think you should know

37:10.729 --> 37:15.565
The adrenal tumor likely
caused her to go back in time.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.335
So now that it's gone...

37:20.404 --> 37:22.505
The fairy tale's over.

37:22.507 --> 37:23.807
Most likely.

37:26.377 --> 37:28.979
Well,
that's too bad.

37:28.981 --> 37:32.482
[ chuckles ]
I almost got kissed.

37:34.385 --> 37:38.321
She obviously loved you
very much.

37:38.323 --> 37:42.626
Yeah, I guess sometimes
that's just not enough.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.401
Dr. Lin,
word has it

37:51.403 --> 37:53.503
You saved
a young mother's uterus today.

37:53.505 --> 37:54.604
Word travels fast.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.673
You probably
also saved her life.

37:56.675 --> 37:57.707
Well done.

37:57.709 --> 37:59.676
What can I do
for you?

37:59.678 --> 38:03.013
There's no easy way
to say this.

38:03.015 --> 38:05.315
Um...
Dr. Kalfas?

38:05.317 --> 38:08.518
Yes.
What about him?

38:09.887 --> 38:12.522
He is abusing narcotics.

38:18.596 --> 38:19.863
This isn't
just a rumor?

38:19.865 --> 38:21.798
I-I saw it.

38:21.800 --> 38:22.866
I caught him.

38:22.868 --> 38:24.634
It's, uh,
it's not a rumor.

38:24.636 --> 38:26.803
It was very brave of you
to tell me.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.638
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.006
Okay.
Thank you.

38:30.008 --> 38:31.975
Maggie,
word to the wise.

38:31.977 --> 38:34.544
You might want
to change your scrubs first.

38:34.546 --> 38:35.712
The blood's
not such a great touch.

38:35.714 --> 38:37.747
I did change.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.582
Oh, my god.

38:39.584 --> 38:41.051
Maggie,
are you okay?

38:41.053 --> 38:43.053
Oh, my god.

38:46.724 --> 38:49.993
I, uh...I thi-- I think
I'm having a miscarriage.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.709
Alex: Hi.

39:05.711 --> 39:07.010
Your surgery
went well.

39:07.012 --> 39:09.112
I was able
to remove your adrenal tumor.

39:09.114 --> 39:11.748
Oh,
that's great news.

39:11.750 --> 39:12.949
Can you tell me
what year it is?

39:12.951 --> 39:13.950
2014.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.618
Good.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.587
Why did you ask me that?

39:17.589 --> 39:19.989
You experienced
a temporary memory lapse.

39:19.991 --> 39:22.992
These adrenal tumors
can do some remarkable things.

39:22.994 --> 39:24.094
Oh.

39:24.096 --> 39:26.062
Lucky for me,
so can you.

39:28.599 --> 39:30.600
Claire is outside
in the hall.

39:34.004 --> 39:35.905
I see.

39:38.442 --> 39:39.976
It's lovely
that she stayed,

39:39.978 --> 39:44.381
But I-I'm really not up
for visitors.

39:44.383 --> 39:48.017
â™ª even if we try

39:48.019 --> 39:51.921
You know, I met
this amazing free spirit today.

39:51.923 --> 39:55.525
And she said
you can't choose who you love.

39:55.527 --> 39:59.062
I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

39:59.064 --> 40:01.798
It isn't too late.

That crazy kiwi shoulder thing
one of these days.

41:39.064 --> 41:40.196
I don't know, man.

41:40.198 --> 41:42.031
You were
like seconds behind me

41:42.033 --> 41:43.967
With your dostoyevsky
and "ulysses"

41:43.969 --> 41:46.069
Or whatever the hell
literature you had.

41:46.071 --> 41:48.505
Okay,
what's it gonna be?

41:48.507 --> 41:51.574
Spoonful of cinnamon
or snort wasabi?

No, although I am very curious
to see that one day,

Come on, dude,
the suspense is killing me here.

42:00.519 --> 42:02.619
Actually,
there is something

to talk to you about.

Yeah?
Yeah.

you should give her some space,

The space
she deserves.

And we had the bet.

what I wanted.
