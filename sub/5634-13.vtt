00:01.502 --> 00:08.175
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.258 --> 00:11.845
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.929 --> 00:14.848
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:14.932 --> 00:18.310
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.393 --> 00:21.480
<i>Lucky there's a man who positively can do</i>

00:21.563 --> 00:22.898
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:22.981 --> 00:24.525
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.608 --> 00:30.072
<i>He's a family guy!</i>

00:39.414 --> 00:42.000
Oh, cool, somebody put
Billy Joel on the jukebox.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.503
Billy Joel? This is Daft Punk.

00:44.586 --> 00:47.673
Dappunk? Wh-- I-- What is that?
That's not even words.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.132
What are you saying? This is Billy Joel.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.134
It's "Anthony's Song,"
parentheses, "Movin' Out."

00:51.218 --> 00:54.346
First of all, it's "Movin' Out,"
parentheses, "Anthony's Song."

00:54.429 --> 00:57.099
And second of all,
this is 100% not Billy Joel!

00:57.182 --> 01:00.978
You know, when they recorded "Movin' Out,"
someone left the studio doors open,

01:01.061 --> 01:03.230
and that's why, at the end,
you hear that car sound.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.649
- That's not true either!
- No, this is it.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.568
He's talking about going
all around the world

01:07.651 --> 01:09.361
'cause this Anthony fella,
he's moving out.

01:09.444 --> 01:12.364
You know, to live with Mr. Cacciatore
down on Mulberry Street.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.783
And that's all I'm gonna
say about those two.

01:14.867 --> 01:16.535
Peter, I'm gonna punch
you with this beer mug

01:16.618 --> 01:17.870
till I'm holding just the handle!

01:17.953 --> 01:20.664
Guys, calm down.
There's one way to solve this.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.082
I'll just use my phone.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.794
It says "'Around the World' by Daft Punk."

01:25.878 --> 01:26.962
Thank you!

01:27.045 --> 01:28.547
God, you idiots are exhausting.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.132
Hey, Cleveland,
how'd you do that with your phone?

01:30.215 --> 01:31.300
I'm not an idiot.

01:31.383 --> 01:32.801
I used Shazam.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.095
It recognizes songs
and tells you their names.

01:35.179 --> 01:36.889
Yeah? Hey, what if I farted into it?

01:36.972 --> 01:38.932
I don't know. Be my guest.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.312
It says "Lana Del Rey."

01:43.395 --> 01:45.147
Wow, how do I get this on my phone?

01:45.230 --> 01:46.315
You just download it.

01:46.398 --> 01:47.774
- It's a app.
- What's an app?

01:47.858 --> 01:50.819
They're little programs you use
on your phone while driving.

01:50.903 --> 01:54.072
Oh, man, apps sound awesome!
This is a real game changer!

01:54.156 --> 01:57.201
Like the guy who invented
wearing a sport jacket with jeans.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.410
So, what can I do for you?

01:58.493 --> 01:59.953
Well, I've got to go to church,

02:00.037 --> 02:01.830
but I don't have time
to change from the rodeo.

02:01.914 --> 02:03.916
Excuse me, I thought
you were helping me find a look

02:03.999 --> 02:05.834
that'll let me cling
to my youth in my 40s.

02:05.918 --> 02:09.004
Yes, I'm interested in cheating on my wife
in Las Vegas.

02:09.087 --> 02:12.174
Gentlemen, I think I can
help all three of you.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.554
Brian, I'm in a bind.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.306
Joanne was supposed to
drive me to the club,

02:19.389 --> 02:20.849
but she's having throat surgery.

02:20.933 --> 02:22.768
20 years of menthol slims.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.353
I don't understand anything you just said.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.146
Just drive me to the racquet club.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.065
Since when do you belong
to a racquet club?

02:28.148 --> 02:30.192
You know, I do have a life
outside this house.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.861
For example,
I also write restaurant reviews

02:32.945 --> 02:35.322
for the newspaper
under the name Hugh Cornwallis.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.032
Hugh Cornwallis? He's, like...

02:37.115 --> 02:39.159
Super bitchy, I know.
Now come on, let's go.

02:39.243 --> 02:40.953
So, what?
You're gonna play tennis all day?

02:41.036 --> 02:43.872
No, I might also hit the treadmill
and watch <i>Kelly and Michael</i>

02:43.956 --> 02:45.666
on mute with closed captioning.

02:45.749 --> 02:50.087
It's like kale is everywhere
these days, am I right?"

02:50.170 --> 02:51.463
unintelligible."

02:51.547 --> 02:52.965
I love them.

02:53.048 --> 02:55.008
They have such an amazing chemistry.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.473
Yeah!

03:01.557 --> 03:02.766
Awesome!

03:02.850 --> 03:04.059
Peter, will you keep it down?

03:04.142 --> 03:06.103
I'm trying to look at lamps
I'll never buy.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.604
Oh, yeah, sorry.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.565
- Sweet!
- What are you doing?

03:09.648 --> 03:11.483
Well, I just found out about
these things called apps,

03:11.567 --> 03:13.193
so that's kind of all I do now.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.779
This one's a cool bowling app I got.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.281
Aw, yeah, strike!

03:17.364 --> 03:19.700
Peter, your phone's streaming to the TV.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.159
You're clearly watching porn.

03:21.243 --> 03:22.452
Will you turn it off?

03:22.536 --> 03:24.371
I'm already caught, Lois.
I'm gonna finish.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.914
- Peter, I'm...
- I'm gonna finish!

03:25.998 --> 03:27.624
Just go over there!

03:27.708 --> 03:30.252
We're gonna be fine, Lois, you and me.

03:34.590 --> 03:36.216
There you are, Dad.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.177
Where have you been?
I haven't seen you in days.

03:38.260 --> 03:40.095
Ugh. I went out of town
for a little while,

03:40.179 --> 03:43.390
but I made the mistake of using
this app called Bear B'n'B.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.100
We're so happy you're staying with us.

03:45.184 --> 03:48.103
Just a reminder, we ask that
you not use the DVD player,

03:48.187 --> 03:50.230
but you can watch any of the VHSs.

03:50.314 --> 03:52.733
We have <i>Clear and Present Danger,</i>
<i>Son of the Mask...</i>

03:52.816 --> 03:54.234
Oh, and here's most of a puzzle.

03:54.318 --> 03:56.111
Okay, well,
I don't want any of that stuff.

03:56.195 --> 03:57.696
Fine. Well, if the phone rings

03:57.779 --> 03:59.198
and we're not around, just take a message.

03:59.281 --> 04:00.824
I'm kind of on vacation.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.619
Oh, and just a heads up,
the dog doesn't like men.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.205
Now, we serve breakfast
from 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m.

04:06.288 --> 04:07.623
I'll skip breakfast.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.041
Uh, everyone eats breakfast.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.292
I'm on vacation.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.835
All the more reason to treat yourself.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.254
The house specialty is a half-chewed trout

04:14.338 --> 04:16.256
we yanked out of the river with our teeth.

04:16.340 --> 04:17.925
Ah, there's the bear stuff.

04:24.223 --> 04:25.307
Where are you going?

04:25.390 --> 04:28.060
Oh, I'm meeting up with someone
from my Grinder app.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.353
Isn't that for anonymous gay hookups?

04:29.436 --> 04:33.148
No, no, no. This one's a way for guys
who enjoy sandwiches to connect.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.778
- You "Meatballfreak"?
- Uh-huh.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.112
All right, let's do this.

04:43.075 --> 04:45.035
Are you also married?

04:50.082 --> 04:52.376
- My phone's broken.
- I'm not surprised.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.379
It's probably because of all those apps
you've been downloading.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.130
Don't say "apps" like you're young.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.507
No, I took it in the shower

04:58.590 --> 05:00.217
'cause I didn't know
you could pause a game.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.594
- Here, Chris. Your first cell phone!
- Yay!

05:02.678 --> 05:05.013
Something my dad held in the bathroom!

05:05.097 --> 05:07.516
You know, Chris,
you could probably salvage that phone.

05:07.599 --> 05:10.310
If you put it in a bag of uncooked rice,
it'll dry out.

05:10.394 --> 05:11.395
Really?

05:11.478 --> 05:14.815
Yeah. And then you can use the rice
to pretend someone wanted to marry you.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.191
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:16.275 --> 05:19.903
Mr. and Mrs. Dog
and Meg the Bounty Hunter!

05:28.412 --> 05:29.997
Holy moley!

05:30.080 --> 05:31.206
Marcy Miller!

05:31.290 --> 05:33.333
She bought feminine products
at my dad's pharmacy,

05:33.417 --> 05:35.377
so you know she's up and running.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.796
Yeah, I wish
I had the guts to talk to her.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.006
Talk to her?

05:39.089 --> 05:40.924
Chris, no one talks to each other anymore.

05:41.008 --> 05:44.511
If you want to get a girl's attention,
you text her a picture of your penis.

05:44.595 --> 05:45.929
What? Really?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.306
- Are-- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.141
People who send their daughters
to public high schools

05:49.224 --> 05:50.517
are basically asking for this.

05:50.601 --> 05:53.687
Well, I did just get
this new phone from my dad.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.067
All right, what could go wrong?

05:59.151 --> 06:00.235
It worked out great for...

06:12.998 --> 06:15.876
Ah. This is it, Bri.
The Quahog Racquet Club.

06:15.959 --> 06:19.546
Where frail old men
come to weigh themselves in the nude.

06:19.630 --> 06:23.217
Does that say 84 or 85?

06:23.300 --> 06:24.968
It says 63.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.261
Oh, dear.

06:26.345 --> 06:28.931
How'd you get all those cuts on your butt?

06:30.474 --> 06:32.684
Wow, they allow drinking here
at 10:30 in the morning?

06:32.768 --> 06:35.604
Oh, yes, half the bathroom trash
is thrown-up scrambled eggs.

06:35.687 --> 06:39.566
Okay, so this place has hot women,
morning booze and free vomit?

06:39.650 --> 06:41.568
- Maybe I'll join you.
- You don't play tennis.

06:41.652 --> 06:43.612
What are you talking about?
I'm a great tennis player.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.322
You are? Well, that's perfect.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.200
There's a doubles tournament coming up,
and I could really use a partner.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.368
Well, you found him!

06:49.451 --> 06:51.828
All right, all right,
I suppose we can make this work.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.831
Like that actress from <i>Rizzoli & Isles</i>
and her husband do.

06:54.915 --> 06:58.418
Honey, I thought we could do
a little role-playing tonight.

06:58.502 --> 07:00.420
Oh, yeah? What'd you have in mind?

07:00.504 --> 07:02.631
Maybe I could be
my character from the show.

07:02.714 --> 07:06.468
Oh! Yeah! From the show! Sure.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.345
Um... Oh, no!

07:08.428 --> 07:10.430
It's the...law enforcement woman.

07:10.514 --> 07:13.058
Part of that great team
of Rizzoli and Isles.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.893
You don't know what part I play, do you?

07:14.977 --> 07:17.354
Hey, look, you didn't marry me
because of my brains.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.649
You married me because I play
one of the main bad guys in <i>Blue Bloods.</i>

07:20.732 --> 07:24.111
Now let's just stop talking
and have idiot actor sex.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.908
Thank you for coming,
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.577
We've got a bit of a situation,

07:31.660 --> 07:34.079
which is why
I've asked Officer Swanson to join us.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.456
It appears Chris sent an
inappropriate photo of himself

07:36.540 --> 07:38.041
to one of his classmates.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.836
That's right.
He texted a picture of his peenie.

07:40.919 --> 07:41.920
Oh, my God!

07:42.004 --> 07:44.131
- And apparently the girl...
- Oh, thank God.

07:44.214 --> 07:47.718
...he sent it to doesn't like him back,
so she turned him in.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.262
Okay, I can see everybody's mad, but...

07:50.345 --> 07:51.847
What'd you think?

07:51.930 --> 07:53.765
Thank you for bringing this
to our attention,

07:53.849 --> 07:55.184
Principal Shepherd.

07:55.267 --> 07:58.478
We'll make sure Chris apologizes
to that little knob-tease.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.689
I'm sorry, Lois, but it's not that simple.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.482
When Chris sent that picture,

08:02.566 --> 08:05.861
he was technically
distributing child pornography.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.571
Child pornography?

08:07.654 --> 08:09.198
Joe, that's crazy!

08:09.281 --> 08:11.700
He's just a teenager
who made a bad choice.

08:11.783 --> 08:14.870
I don't know what to say,
but the laws just haven't caught up

08:14.953 --> 08:16.455
to how cool kids are now.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.957
I'm sorry, but this makes Chris
a sex offender.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.375
Oh, my God!

08:20.459 --> 08:21.502
Huh.

08:21.585 --> 08:24.171
Well, I'm not about to make
a Batman exit right now,

08:24.254 --> 08:26.548
but has that thing always been over there?

08:26.632 --> 08:28.133
Over where?

08:28.217 --> 08:29.551
What are you doing, Peter?

08:29.635 --> 08:31.345
Ah, you looked back too fast.

08:38.602 --> 08:40.103
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.

08:40.187 --> 08:43.148
Today, we bring you a disturbing
case of child pornography.

08:43.232 --> 08:47.110
Local teenage scumbag Chris Griffin,
whose name will be omitted here,

08:47.194 --> 08:50.572
was caught sending, quote-unquote,
"graphic selfies of his hog"...

08:50.656 --> 08:52.324
Not sure where that quote is from--

08:52.407 --> 08:54.117
...to another underage student.

08:54.201 --> 08:57.746
Coming up next, teleprompter guy
puts the period in a weird.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.456
Place.

08:59.540 --> 09:00.916
Oh, this is awful.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.502
Now everyone in town
knows I'm a sex offender!

09:03.585 --> 09:07.506
We know you didn't mean any harm, Chris.
We're just living in a different time.

09:07.589 --> 09:10.676
When I was your age,
boys used to just whip it out on the bus.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.554
Can't I just go on the news
and tell everyone I'm sorry?

09:13.637 --> 09:15.264
Oh, I wish you could, sweetie,

09:15.347 --> 09:17.432
but the law says that, as a sex offender,

09:17.516 --> 09:19.977
you have to complete
a rehabilitation course.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.937
Oh, that sounds awful.

09:22.020 --> 09:25.148
Eh, can't be any worse
than our trip to Hawaii.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.986
Okay, before you do anything else,
I'm deathly allergic to pineapple, pork,

09:29.069 --> 09:30.737
rum, macadamia nuts,

09:30.821 --> 09:35.242
stupid tiny guitars, overpriced golf,
sentimental military stuff, lava,

09:35.325 --> 09:37.452
people who I can't tell
are black or Asian,

09:37.536 --> 09:39.538
apostrophes, anyone twirling flames,

09:39.621 --> 09:41.582
second weddings and linen pants.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.375
Is there anything you're not allergic to?

09:43.458 --> 09:46.879
Yeah, the Epcot Center.
Where I <i>wanted</i> to go.

09:50.632 --> 09:53.177
Good evening,
I'm Glenn Quagmire, your instructor.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.636
Everyone look to your left.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.180
Now look to your right.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.973
All of you are sex offenders,

09:58.056 --> 10:00.267
and statistically
you will all be here again.

10:00.350 --> 10:03.270
Because this has never worked
in the history of doing this.

10:03.353 --> 10:06.106
Now, today, we have a new
member, giggity, Chris G.

10:06.190 --> 10:07.566
Hi, Chris.

10:07.649 --> 10:10.402
All right, before we begin,
whoever's driving a windowless van

10:10.485 --> 10:12.487
painted like an ice cream truck,
your lights are on.

10:14.990 --> 10:18.744
Okay, next, let's take a few minutes
to talk about our new, fake interests.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.245
Here's a clay pot I made.

10:20.329 --> 10:22.456
I've started following
girls' field hockey.

10:22.539 --> 10:23.582
No, come on.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.584
You're supposed to pick from the list.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.586
Mr. Quagmire, this is terrible.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.713
And do I really have to be here?

10:29.796 --> 10:31.673
Well, the law does give you a choice.

10:31.757 --> 10:33.175
This or chemical castration.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.135
- What's that?
- You take a ton of pills

10:35.219 --> 10:36.929
that completely wipe out all sexuality.

10:37.012 --> 10:38.597
Oh, is that what Michael Moore did?

10:38.680 --> 10:40.516
No, but I understand why you'd think that.

10:40.599 --> 10:42.643
Now, do you want to see the list?

10:42.726 --> 10:45.229
I could take a whack
at hand-distressing furniture.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.480
We don't say "whack."

11:01.703 --> 11:02.704
Very good, Stewie.

11:02.788 --> 11:04.665
You grunt like a Hungarian lesbian.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.041
Thanks, Dimitri.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.502
And, uh, your testicle's hanging
out of your shorts again.

11:08.585 --> 11:09.920
I am cooling it.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.713
But where is this partner of yours?

11:11.797 --> 11:14.299
I don't know. He was supposed
to be here 15 minutes ago.

11:14.383 --> 11:15.968
- You're right.

11:16.051 --> 11:17.511
So, anyway, my ex said,

11:17.594 --> 11:19.471
"If you bring home one more tennis trophy,

11:19.555 --> 11:20.722
I am out of here."

11:20.806 --> 11:22.266
Well, she was gone in two days.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.602
Oh, Brian.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.521
"O'Brien"? That's my Irish cousin.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.400
What are you doing?

11:31.483 --> 11:33.151
We're supposed to be practicing
for the tournament.

11:33.235 --> 11:36.405
Stewie, relax. I promise we'll practice,
but we just ordered bisque.

11:36.488 --> 11:37.739
How are you paying for that?

11:37.823 --> 11:39.074
Well, if you must know,

11:39.157 --> 11:41.076
we're putting it on Philippa's
husband's account.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.703
Does Burt know about this?

11:42.786 --> 11:44.913
He would if he wasn't
working all the time.

11:44.997 --> 11:46.623
Thank you, Brian.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.293
Now, come on, let's have more
hard liquor and creamy soups.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.669
Ugh.

11:54.590 --> 11:56.800
Meg, can you hand me the paper plates?

11:56.884 --> 11:58.886
I can't believe
we're having an ice cream cake

11:58.969 --> 12:01.430
to celebrate Chris graduating
from sex offender school.

12:01.513 --> 12:05.100
Well, the opportunities to celebrate
don't come often in this household.

12:05.184 --> 12:08.937
There he is, Mr. Former Sex Offender.

12:09.021 --> 12:10.606
But Mom, it's not that big a deal.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.733
All I did was finish those creepy classes.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.902
I know, but now your record is clear.

12:14.985 --> 12:18.614
You can go back to being a normal boy
and put all this behind you.

12:18.697 --> 12:20.908
Hey, Chris,
wait till you see the funny thing

12:20.991 --> 12:22.576
I had 'em put on your cake.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.578
"Happy sixth birthday, Timmy"?

12:24.661 --> 12:26.496
Uh-oh, they must have mixed them up.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.208
"Nice crank, you dirty little bastard"?

12:29.291 --> 12:30.417
Sorry, I'll take that.

12:30.501 --> 12:32.628
Here's your cake.
I ate a great deal of it.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.176
Oh, there you are.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.094
How was your first day out of rehab?

12:41.178 --> 12:42.387
It was terrible.

12:42.471 --> 12:44.139
Taking that class made no difference.

12:44.223 --> 12:46.350
Nobody wants anything to do with me.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.603
- Hi, Mr. Herbert.
- Oh, my God. Children, run!

12:49.686 --> 12:50.687
It's that pervert!

12:50.771 --> 12:53.273
- Everybody into my safety basement!

12:53.357 --> 12:54.483
- Oh!

12:54.566 --> 12:57.194
Oh, that was a bad snap. I'm hurt, kids!

12:57.277 --> 12:59.988
Don't eat those popsicles
till I get down there!

13:05.035 --> 13:07.704
Well, I'm glad we're finally
getting some practice in.

13:07.788 --> 13:11.500
Yeah, nothing like running around
after eating a seafood tower.

13:11.583 --> 13:12.793
What are you doing here?

13:12.876 --> 13:14.294
You're supposed to be at the baseline.

13:14.378 --> 13:15.796
Yeah, baseline, baseline.

13:15.879 --> 13:18.799
- Right, right.
- He's serving to you. Get back there!

13:24.513 --> 13:26.390
You've never played tennis, have you?

13:26.473 --> 13:27.808
- Not once.
- Damn it, Brian!

13:27.891 --> 13:31.061
I entered us in that tournament
because you said you could play!

13:31.144 --> 13:34.439
And I will not be humiliated
in front of shallow, rich alcoholics!

13:38.610 --> 13:40.028
Hey, Chris.

13:40.112 --> 13:43.407
I see you walked across the grass again
instead of using the walk.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.910
You're really wearing a path, aren't you?
We call that Chris's Trail.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.496
Right there. Chris's Trail.

13:49.580 --> 13:53.125
Mr. Quagmire, I completed that sex rehab
and I paid my debt to society,

13:53.208 --> 13:56.336
but people are still afraid of
me, like I'm some kind of creep.

13:56.420 --> 14:00.007
How do I get them to treat me
the way they did before all this happened?

14:00.090 --> 14:01.508
You can't. I'm sorry, Chris,

14:01.592 --> 14:03.719
but you're just gonna have to accept
that from now on,

14:03.802 --> 14:05.721
people are gonna see you
as a sex-crazed pervert.

14:05.804 --> 14:07.806
And there's nothing
you can do to change that.

14:07.890 --> 14:10.851
Wait a minute, maybe there is.

14:10.934 --> 14:13.103
- Thanks, Mr. Quagmire.
- No problem, Chris.

14:13.187 --> 14:15.522
- You keep that chin up, huh?
- I will.

14:15.606 --> 14:17.107
Hey, can I ring your doorbell?

14:17.191 --> 14:18.442
- No, I'd rather you...

14:18.525 --> 14:20.903
- That's why "no," Chris.

14:20.986 --> 14:22.029
That's why "no."

14:28.952 --> 14:31.163
Chris? What the hell happened to you?

14:31.246 --> 14:32.998
Mother, Father,

14:33.081 --> 14:35.501
I decided to have myself
chemically castrated.

14:35.584 --> 14:37.169
Why the hell would you do that?

14:37.252 --> 14:39.713
Now nobody will have
any reason to be afraid of me

14:39.796 --> 14:41.048
or think I'm a pervert,

14:41.131 --> 14:44.092
and everybody can just
treat me like normal again.

14:44.176 --> 14:47.596
Oh, my God, I can't believe
my son's some kind of weirdo!

14:47.679 --> 14:49.389
Oop, here comes another sandwich.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.560
I can't even look at you.

15:00.651 --> 15:02.569
Has anyone seen my sandals?

15:02.653 --> 15:04.530
Yeah, no, nobody's seen your sandals.

15:04.613 --> 15:06.782
Well, I'll just have to make another pair.

15:06.865 --> 15:09.743
Look, Chris,
I know you think chemical castration

15:09.826 --> 15:11.328
is gonna solve your problems,

15:11.411 --> 15:13.455
but you have to stop taking those pills.

15:13.539 --> 15:14.998
I don't have to do anything,

15:15.082 --> 15:17.709
besides get to the wind chime
store before it closes.

15:17.793 --> 15:19.294
There can't be a whole store.

15:19.378 --> 15:22.005
To be fair, they also have
a couple of kaleidoscopes.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.340
Ah, can I come?

15:23.423 --> 15:25.592
Lois, can I go to the store
with that thing?

15:25.676 --> 15:28.929
Splendid. I'll go get my burlap wallet.

15:29.012 --> 15:32.224
Wow, we rolled three gutter balls
on these kids, huh?

15:44.111 --> 15:47.781
My word, Brian, you're really improving.
We might actually win this thing.

15:47.865 --> 15:51.243
Thanks. You know, I just pretend
that tennis ball is Mitch McConnell

15:51.326 --> 15:53.704
trying to roll back subsidies
on the Affordable Care Act,

15:53.787 --> 15:54.830
and I'm like, "Nope!"

15:54.913 --> 15:56.832
Yeah, I-- I don't...
I don't need to hear your process.

15:56.915 --> 15:58.375
Look, I'm just happy you pushed me,

15:58.458 --> 15:59.877
'cause now I can't wait
for that tournament.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.628
I know, it's gonna be great.

16:01.712 --> 16:04.631
And I already know exactly
where I'm gonna put that trophy.

16:04.715 --> 16:05.924
So the baby died?

16:06.008 --> 16:07.467
Yeah, the baby died.

16:07.551 --> 16:09.136
But, look, first place.

16:13.724 --> 16:16.685
Chris, your mother and I
want you to stop taking them pills.

16:16.768 --> 16:19.271
There's a lot of great things
about having a sex drive

16:19.354 --> 16:21.273
- that you're missing out on.
- Like what?

16:21.356 --> 16:23.942
Well, there's the post-orgy
meals at a swingers party.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.361
Come on, let's eat
with these wonderful people.

16:26.445 --> 16:28.655
Hey, everybody, try my wife's ambrosia.

16:28.739 --> 16:31.742
If you liked my wife's snizz,
you're gonna love her ambrosia.

16:31.825 --> 16:35.996
I was thinking about this seven-layer dip
the whole time I was chowing Ronald.

16:36.079 --> 16:38.832
I don't like this. I want to go home.

16:38.916 --> 16:40.125
You know what's sad?

16:40.209 --> 16:42.753
There's hardly any other
fathers and sons here.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.091
I don't know, Lois.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.636
I just don't think Chris
is gonna change his mind.

16:50.719 --> 16:51.720
I know.

16:51.803 --> 16:54.640
It's only a matter of time
before he shaves one side of his head

16:54.723 --> 16:56.600
and swoops the rest of the hair over.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.019
Why, is that... Is that bad?

16:59.102 --> 17:02.898
Good early evening, everyone.
I have celebratory news.

17:02.981 --> 17:07.110
With all the free time,
I'm no longer devoting to onanism...

17:07.194 --> 17:08.862
- That's spanking it?
- Yes, Peter.

17:08.946 --> 17:11.907
...I have managed to redirect
that energy into my studies.

17:11.990 --> 17:15.202
In fact, today I received
the Kaplan Prize in biology.

17:15.285 --> 17:17.204
Chris, that's great!

17:17.287 --> 17:20.666
Not only that, I got the highest
score on my Spanish test,

17:20.749 --> 17:22.835
and I even joined the debate team.

17:22.918 --> 17:24.711
That's amazing!

17:24.795 --> 17:27.714
All right, well, I'm gonna
put some flowers in a wagon

17:27.798 --> 17:29.591
and walk around town.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.636
You know what, Peter?

17:32.719 --> 17:35.097
Maybe there's a silver lining
to this fiasco.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.099
Not thinking about sex all the time

17:37.182 --> 17:39.935
seems to have allowed Chris
to excel in other areas.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.103
He does seem sharper.

17:41.186 --> 17:43.021
Heck, the old Chris
couldn't even figure out

17:43.105 --> 17:45.023
the self-checkout at the supermarket.

17:45.107 --> 17:47.484
<i>Please place</i><i>the item in the bagging area.</i>

17:47.568 --> 17:49.987
<i>Please remove the item</i>
<i>from the bagging area.</i>

17:50.070 --> 17:52.990
<i>Please take a plastic bag</i>
<i>from the bagging area.</i>

17:53.073 --> 17:55.409
<i>Please put the bag over</i>
<i>your head and tighten.</i>

18:03.208 --> 18:05.085
<i>I told you I could make him do it.</i>

18:05.169 --> 18:08.130
<i>That's hard-core, man. You're hard-core.</i>

18:13.677 --> 18:16.513
All right, Brian, we win this set,
the tournament's ours.

18:16.597 --> 18:18.056
Yeah, come on, let's do this.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.392
I can already see our
names in the newsletter,

18:20.475 --> 18:22.895
right below the deaths
from the previous quarter.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.613
- Out.
- What!

18:32.696 --> 18:33.822
Your ball was long.

18:33.906 --> 18:36.116
Are you me? That thing was in!

18:36.200 --> 18:37.618
You're gonna penalize us

18:37.701 --> 18:40.579
because you're a blind
blue jacket !

18:40.662 --> 18:41.914
Stewie, calm down.

18:41.997 --> 18:43.373
I will drop you to your knees

18:43.457 --> 18:45.584
and shove my racket
so far down your throat

18:45.667 --> 18:47.628
you'll be my grip for a week!

18:47.711 --> 18:49.129
Warning, Mr. Griffin.

18:49.213 --> 18:51.340
Oh, you're warning me! I'm warning you!

18:51.423 --> 18:53.967
I'm gonna go to your house
and your wife!

18:54.051 --> 18:57.179
You proud of yourself,
tennis club security guard?

18:57.262 --> 18:58.972
Your kids look up to you? Big man.

18:59.056 --> 19:01.225
Throwing out a baby and a dog. Tough guy.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.769
Maybe I'll see you later
when you don't have that name tag on.

19:03.852 --> 19:06.730
- I thought your shot was in.
- Oh, hey, pound it, dude.

19:11.068 --> 19:13.028
So to find the area of this circle,

19:13.111 --> 19:16.240
we're going to need to use pi,
whose digits go on forever.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.826
Can you imagine
if our pi was endless?

19:19.910 --> 19:22.037
We'd all be changing our belt sizes.

19:24.122 --> 19:26.124
Thanks, Chris.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.835
Wow, that was really something.

19:27.918 --> 19:29.211
Marcy?

19:29.294 --> 19:32.047
I had no idea you were
such an amazing tutor.

19:32.130 --> 19:33.715
And I really like your pendant.

19:33.799 --> 19:37.052
Thanks, but why are you
being so nice to me?

19:37.135 --> 19:39.054
You got me in so much trouble before.

19:39.137 --> 19:40.973
Yeah, I'm really sorry about that.

19:41.056 --> 19:43.141
That was just my dumb, overprotective dad.

19:43.225 --> 19:44.393
Really?

19:44.476 --> 19:47.312
Yeah, he took my phone to look
at pictures of my friends,

19:47.396 --> 19:48.939
and he found the one you sent.

19:49.022 --> 19:51.900
- I bet that caught him by surprise.
- Definitely.

19:51.984 --> 19:55.237
Well, I hope you know
that's not who I am anymore.

19:55.320 --> 19:59.241
I do, and I hope I didn't
cause you too much trouble.

20:05.497 --> 20:06.915
This is not a drill!

20:06.999 --> 20:08.876
I repeat, not a drill!

20:10.544 --> 20:13.005
Good to be back
doing this again, huh, Bill?

20:13.088 --> 20:16.091
What, shoveling coal into a penis?
I was sleeping.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.635
What's happening?

20:18.719 --> 20:20.137
I don't know.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.264
Someone... Someone get me nude art books!

20:22.347 --> 20:24.183
I need nude art books!

20:24.266 --> 20:26.018
Oh, good, Chris.

20:26.101 --> 20:28.228
You can hang this
<i>New York Times</i> back on...

20:28.312 --> 20:31.023
Oh, a pee-pee!

20:34.776 --> 20:37.029
Well, Chris, you killed that librarian,

20:37.112 --> 20:39.531
but we're glad to have you
back to your old self.

20:39.615 --> 20:42.075
Mrs. Lapardo worked at that school
for 54 years.

20:42.159 --> 20:45.370
Well, at least she saw a little wang
before taking that dirt nap.

20:45.454 --> 20:46.455
Thanks, you guys.

20:46.538 --> 20:49.625
I guess chemical castration
isn't for everyone.

20:49.708 --> 20:52.544
I-- Is that...
Is that the lesson for this week?

20:52.628 --> 20:56.215
Uh, I guess it's that
or be kinder on the tennis court.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.841
Where have you been?
