WEBVTT

00:02.352 --> 00:05.287
<i>The kick is up, it's long enough.</i>

00:05.388 --> 00:07.185
<i>The kick is no good.</i>

00:07.257 --> 00:09.088
Yes!

00:09.192 --> 00:10.716
- Yeah!
- Who won?

00:10.860 --> 00:13.021
Who cares? We covered the spread.

00:15.031 --> 00:17.090
Charlie, call me an old-fashioned dad,

00:17.200 --> 00:19.930
but I was hoping my son
wouldn't start betting on sports

00:20.003 --> 00:22.335
until he was old enough
to have a drinking problem.

00:22.439 --> 00:26.102
He didn't really make a bet.
I just gave him a taste of my action.

00:26.176 --> 00:28.667
Nor do I want him tasting your action.

00:29.646 --> 00:32.581
Dad, without action, there's no juice.

00:33.483 --> 00:35.678
All of a sudden he's Frank Sinatra.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.345
- I bet that's the pizza.
- What's the spread?

00:38.455 --> 00:39.854
Pepperoni.

00:42.192 --> 00:45.025
What's next, Charlie?
You gonna teach him how to shoot craps?

00:45.128 --> 00:46.686
He already knows how to shoot craps.

00:46.796 --> 00:49.993
I just wish I could teach him
not to bet the hard eight.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.993
Mr. Harper, here you go, nice and hot.
I threw in some extra garlic puffs as well.

00:55.105 --> 00:56.538
Thanks, pal.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.300
Thank you, Mr. Harper.

00:58.374 --> 01:00.842
If there's anything at all you ever need,
please call.

01:00.944 --> 01:03.845
You know, pizza, dry-cleaning,
pot, women.

01:05.782 --> 01:09.047
- How much did you tip him?
- I don't know, I gave him $50.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.313
That's like a 300บบ tip.

01:11.387 --> 01:13.617
If you say so. I was never good at math.

01:13.690 --> 01:16.682
Yeah, but you can figure out
the point spread, the over-under

01:16.793 --> 01:19.353
and the vigorish
on every football game in the country.

01:19.462 --> 01:22.192
What can I tell you?
I've got a beautiful mind.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:32.842 --> 01:35.504
Morning, Berta. Need some help?

01:35.578 --> 01:38.138
Yeah. Come to my house
and explain to my daughter

01:38.214 --> 01:42.207
that we don't put up bail for cute guys
with Costa Rican passports.

01:42.986 --> 01:45.181
- Morning.
- I got your groceries, Charlie.

01:45.255 --> 01:46.745
You owe me $74.

01:46.856 --> 01:49.916
- Why didn't you just use my credit card?
- I tried.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.493
Funny story.

01:55.598 --> 01:57.498
My platinum card.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.768
Look what they did to my platinum card.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.934
They decapitated my holographic eagle.

02:04.774 --> 02:07.607
Yeah, that's sad. You owe me $74.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.701
Relax, I'll write you a check.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.876
Berta, I'm good for $74.

02:13.983 --> 02:17.544
There's an assistant store manager
with bad skin and a pair of scissors

02:17.654 --> 02:19.019
who begs to differ.

02:19.189 --> 02:23.353
He obviously made a mistake.
Leave it to me, I'll straighten it out.

02:25.495 --> 02:27.156
Alan, what do I do?

02:27.497 --> 02:30.660
Call the bank that issued the card
and figure out what's going on.

02:30.733 --> 02:31.893
Good idea.

02:34.103 --> 02:36.003
How do I get the number?

02:36.105 --> 02:38.437
It's usually on the back of the card.

02:42.879 --> 02:45.177
Okay, this may take a while.

02:48.218 --> 02:49.708
Are you sure?

02:50.053 --> 02:51.543
Okay, thanks.

02:52.355 --> 02:53.913
I don't believe it.

02:54.457 --> 02:56.687
None of my bills have been paid
in four months.

02:56.759 --> 02:59.387
My credit is shot. All my cards are dead.

02:59.462 --> 03:01.862
You don't have to worry
about paying me this week.

03:01.965 --> 03:03.091
Thank you, Berta.

03:03.199 --> 03:06.396
I'll just take this espresso maker
and be on my way.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.799
Call me when things pick up.

03:11.140 --> 03:13.370
Charlie, why haven't you been
paying your bills?

03:13.443 --> 03:16.606
Alan, I don't pay my own bills.
I've got a guy.

03:16.713 --> 03:18.806
Do you think you might want
to call your guy?

03:18.915 --> 03:21.247
Don't talk down to me, Alan.
I'm not stupid.

03:21.317 --> 03:22.784
That's the first call I made.

03:22.886 --> 03:24.945
- And?
- And

03:25.788 --> 03:28.655
his number is not in service at this time.

03:34.163 --> 03:35.994
Wonderful building.

03:36.566 --> 03:37.794
What's wrong with it?

03:37.901 --> 03:40.961
The phrase "reeks of urine"
comes to mind.

03:47.343 --> 03:48.674
Here we are.

03:50.179 --> 03:51.976
That's seldom a good sign.

03:55.251 --> 03:57.947
- Hello, Stan?
- Who wants to know?

03:58.788 --> 04:00.449
It's Charlie Harper.

04:01.958 --> 04:05.018
Charlie! Good to see you. Come on in.

04:05.128 --> 04:07.528
Just don't rip the tape, they check.

04:08.631 --> 04:10.929
So what's going on?
What can I do you for?

04:11.034 --> 04:12.831
Stan, I've got a problem.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.327
Yeah, I know the feeling.

04:15.772 --> 04:18.332
Sit down, talk to me. Come on.

04:19.608 --> 04:22.339
All of my credit cards are dead.

04:22.445 --> 04:25.881
And they tell me the bills
haven't been paid in four months.

04:26.482 --> 04:28.677
Yeah, that sounds about right.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.788
Excuse me,
maybe this is none of my business,

04:33.856 --> 04:35.847
but how does something like that happen?

04:35.959 --> 04:38.689
In layman's terms,
your brother ran out of money.

04:38.795 --> 04:41.286
What? How did I run out of money?

04:41.364 --> 04:43.457
I knew you'd ask that.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.131
Let me demonstrate.

04:48.037 --> 04:49.834
Think of this water as cash flow,

04:49.906 --> 04:52.966
which, for you, would be
royalties from your jingles, right?

04:53.042 --> 04:56.910
And this cup, your financial well-being.

04:58.414 --> 04:59.972
This little hole

05:01.985 --> 05:05.250
would be your expenses. You dig?

05:05.888 --> 05:09.016
Now, Charlie, with most people,

05:10.093 --> 05:11.822
when money comes in,

05:13.096 --> 05:15.894
it drips out and pays their bills

05:15.999 --> 05:19.560
with a healthy reserve for emergencies.

05:22.605 --> 05:26.871
But with you, however...
This is what I love about you, Charlie.

05:33.683 --> 05:37.175
You spend it as quick as you get it.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.782
You see, you don't drip,

05:41.691 --> 05:43.124
you hemorrhage.

05:47.363 --> 05:48.728
Look at that.

05:48.798 --> 05:52.461
But when the cash flow
starts to slow down,

05:53.770 --> 05:56.102
there's no reserve.

05:56.939 --> 05:58.099
Okay.

05:59.208 --> 06:01.142
But what happened to my money?

06:02.311 --> 06:05.769
Artists. Where would we be
without them?

06:07.483 --> 06:10.941
What I don't understand is why
you didn't warn him this was happening.

06:11.054 --> 06:12.749
<i>Okay, mea culpa.</i>

06:13.489 --> 06:18.085
Look, I've been a little distracted lately.
Slight problem with the feds.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.459
Are you embezzling from my brother?

06:20.563 --> 06:23.498
Embezzle what? Hello!

06:24.767 --> 06:26.394
I thought you were the smart one.

06:26.469 --> 06:29.495
No, this is a totally unrelated,

06:29.605 --> 06:32.267
import-export problem, all right?

06:32.975 --> 06:37.639
I just cannot believe that one of
the pi๑atas showed up at a kids' party.

06:40.483 --> 06:41.950
Oh, boy.

06:42.251 --> 06:44.481
This has been a blast.
Don't get me wrong,

06:44.587 --> 06:48.079
but I have a plane to catch right now.

06:48.458 --> 06:53.122
I'll tell you what, just feel free
and browse through all your files.

06:53.629 --> 06:57.759
Listen, Charlie, I'm running a little short
on cash, so maybe you...

06:57.834 --> 07:01.167
Look who I'm asking!

07:01.370 --> 07:04.100
It was great meeting you, sport. Ciao.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.544
And you were worried.

07:23.126 --> 07:26.152
The good news is
that a substantial amount of royalties

07:26.229 --> 07:28.356
is gonna come in
in the next couple of months.

07:28.464 --> 07:30.989
Great. Problem solved.
Let's go out to dinner.

07:31.067 --> 07:33.900
- No, problem not solved.
- But I'm hungry.

07:34.504 --> 07:35.994
Get used to it.

07:37.039 --> 07:40.998
It's going to take a while to pay off
all the bills your accountant ignored,

07:41.077 --> 07:43.136
so until then,
you're gonna have to cut back.

07:43.212 --> 07:46.841
- But you said I got money coming.
- Shall I go get the paper cup?

07:48.584 --> 07:50.518
Okay. What do we cut?

07:50.920 --> 07:52.820
Let's look at your expenses.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.653
First thing is,
we stop paying your accountant.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.216
That's a little cold, isn't it?

07:58.327 --> 08:01.819
He's great, I've known him for years.
He's going through a rough patch.

08:01.898 --> 08:04.765
- Charlie, you're broke.
- You're right, screw him.

08:04.867 --> 08:05.993
What's next?

08:06.068 --> 08:08.434
You have a gardener.
Why do you have a gardener?

08:08.538 --> 08:10.233
To tend my garden.

08:11.007 --> 08:14.374
Garden? You mean the two potted palms
on the deck?

08:15.511 --> 08:16.705
Water them yourself.

08:16.779 --> 08:20.738
Okay, but I'm gonna have to buy a hose
and one of those watering things,

08:20.850 --> 08:23.341
so isn't that kind of a push?

08:23.886 --> 08:26.946
Gone. Now,
"Ultimate Premiere Satellite package"?

08:27.089 --> 08:30.581
That's really cool.
I get every sporting event in the world.

08:30.693 --> 08:35.221
If a kid in Madagascar throws a rock
at a tree, I can see it and bet on it.

08:36.198 --> 08:37.563
It's gone.

08:37.633 --> 08:40.466
Oh, man.
We can keep the cable, though, right?

08:40.570 --> 08:42.299
You have satellite and cable?

08:42.405 --> 08:44.737
Sometimes there's solar flares.

08:44.874 --> 08:46.899
Okay, we can cut back to basic cable.

08:46.976 --> 08:50.309
Basic cable?
That's what they get in prison.

08:53.716 --> 08:56.378
- Hey, what you doing?
- Bad time, Rose.

08:56.452 --> 08:58.283
Money problems?

08:59.055 --> 09:02.320
- How did you know?
- I bought your espresso maker from Berta.

09:02.425 --> 09:06.088
I got a great deal 'cause she didn't want
to carry it on the bus.

09:06.162 --> 09:07.322
Wonderful.

09:07.463 --> 09:11.763
Charlie, "miscellaneous cash expenses"?
What exactly is that?

09:12.568 --> 09:16.231
I don't know. Go see a movie,
buy a hot dog, stuff like that.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.296
It was $80,000 last year.

09:19.976 --> 09:23.070
That. That's women and gambling.

09:24.447 --> 09:26.381
Gone and gone.

09:27.049 --> 09:29.779
Great. Why don't I just shoot myself?

09:29.885 --> 09:31.876
You can't afford a gun.

09:33.222 --> 09:35.383
You know,
I could lend you some money, Charlie.

09:35.458 --> 09:39.155
That's very sweet, Rose,
but I don't really want to shoot myself.

09:39.262 --> 09:42.254
The way I see it, you're either gonna
have to slash expenses,

09:42.331 --> 09:44.663
or find the money to pay your bills
someplace else.

09:44.767 --> 09:46.132
Okay.

09:46.669 --> 09:49.661
- I'll borrow on the house.
- You've already got three mortgages.

09:49.772 --> 09:52.468
- Is that a lot?
- Not if you have three houses.

09:53.242 --> 09:55.107
Let me ask you a tough question.

09:55.177 --> 09:59.170
What would you think about going
to Mom for a short-term loan?

10:00.449 --> 10:02.178
Interesting idea.

10:02.818 --> 10:07.016
I think I'd rather have a pack of hyenas
tear out and devour my intestines.

10:08.291 --> 10:11.089
Yeah, I know. I can't afford hyenas.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.321
Look, you know I'd help you if I could,

10:14.430 --> 10:17.331
but all my money's going
to my former wife, my former house,

10:17.433 --> 10:20.596
my former wife's current lawyers
and all their descendants.

10:20.670 --> 10:22.331
So if you don't want to go to Mom,

10:22.438 --> 10:25.305
you're gonna have to change your lifestyle
for a few months.

10:25.374 --> 10:26.898
Fine. You win.

10:27.176 --> 10:30.509
I win? What do I win?
How is this a win for me?

10:30.613 --> 10:32.774
Whatever. I'll cut back, like you said.

10:32.848 --> 10:35.942
Now come on, let's all go out
for a nice dinner. I'm buying.

10:36.018 --> 10:39.476
Great. Then after we can stop by my place
for espresso.

10:39.955 --> 10:43.015
Good idea. That's a money saver.

10:49.832 --> 10:53.199
"Save 50 cents on one regular-sized
Hamburger Helper

10:53.302 --> 10:56.465
"when you buy two of the following
10.5 ounce... "

10:56.539 --> 10:57.870
Screw it.

11:05.281 --> 11:07.181
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:07.950 --> 11:09.941
How do you like that cabernet?

11:10.686 --> 11:13.849
- It's very good.
- I'll have to try it sometime.

11:13.956 --> 11:17.790
And excuse me for saying so, but you
really don't need the Lean Cuisine.

11:17.860 --> 11:19.327
Thank you.

11:19.962 --> 11:22.453
So, how do you like this

11:24.500 --> 11:25.694
cheese?

11:26.068 --> 11:27.160
That.

11:27.236 --> 11:31.332
I do a little volunteer work making
sandwiches for a homeless shelter.

11:34.377 --> 11:37.813
I don't know if you know this,
but a lot of those homeless fellas

11:37.880 --> 11:40.144
like a little snort once in awhile.

11:41.584 --> 11:43.916
Okay. Seek and ye shall find.

11:44.019 --> 11:46.681
Twenty-four rolls of toilet paper for $3.99.

11:46.756 --> 11:48.621
I know what you're thinking,
it's single-ply,

11:48.691 --> 11:51.956
but at this price, you can double up,
triple up, go wild!

11:53.028 --> 11:55.019
Okay, have a nice day.

11:56.098 --> 11:58.532
I can't do this anymore, Alan. I quit.

11:58.601 --> 12:00.762
You can't quit poverty, Charlie.

12:02.605 --> 12:04.163
I want the good stuff.

12:04.240 --> 12:08.301
I want cheese that isn't air-dropped
into third-world countries.

12:08.377 --> 12:10.675
I want ouchless toilet paper.

12:12.014 --> 12:16.314
I want vodka that doesn't look like
Fred Flintstone would drink it.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.386
I want my life back.

12:19.488 --> 12:23.925
Fine, then swallow your pride, call Mom,
and ask her to lend you some money.

12:29.231 --> 12:30.858
Yabba-dabba-doo.

12:34.336 --> 12:36.031
Who's the favorite?

12:36.238 --> 12:38.502
- Green Bay.
- Did you bet them?

12:38.574 --> 12:39.666
No.

12:40.776 --> 12:42.437
You took the Redskins?

12:43.345 --> 12:45.279
- No action?
- None.

12:47.183 --> 12:50.414
- Then why are we watching?
- Beats the hell out of me.

12:52.121 --> 12:53.782
Anybody want a snack?

12:54.790 --> 12:56.280
Pizza's here.

12:56.525 --> 12:58.356
You ordered a pizza?

12:59.261 --> 13:01.889
Charlie, you're supposed to be
cutting back on expenses.

13:01.964 --> 13:04.455
Alan, it's a pizza, not a hooker.

13:07.803 --> 13:09.566
Hey, Mr. Harper. Good to see you.

13:09.638 --> 13:11.936
I threw in
some of those garlic puffs you like.

13:12.041 --> 13:15.238
Grabbed a bottle of house red.
I don't think they'll miss it.

13:15.311 --> 13:18.280
Thanks, buddy. Here's for the pizza and...

13:18.380 --> 13:19.608
Charlie.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.876
Can I speak with you for a minute?

13:24.053 --> 13:25.577
Hang on a sec.

13:26.956 --> 13:29.447
- What are you planning on tipping him?
- I don't know.

13:29.558 --> 13:31.583
Give him $2. That's 15บบ.

13:31.694 --> 13:33.719
- I can't do that.
- You have to.

13:47.743 --> 13:49.973
I can't. Did you see his face?

13:50.546 --> 13:51.740
Go.

13:55.484 --> 13:58.044
- There you go.
- Thank you, Mr. Harper.

13:59.421 --> 14:01.048
These are ones.

14:01.390 --> 14:02.550
Yeah.

14:03.158 --> 14:05.126
I can break $100.

14:05.227 --> 14:09.220
Yeah, I'm having
kind of a cash flow problem.

14:09.798 --> 14:12.426
Yeah. Well, we had a good run.

14:15.337 --> 14:16.634
Wait.

14:18.474 --> 14:20.567
- Here.
- No, keep it.

14:20.676 --> 14:22.507
You need it more than I do.

14:26.582 --> 14:30.245
So, Deborah said that Julie had
an addiction to cosmetic procedures.

14:30.319 --> 14:33.948
And I said, "Well, then she needs to go
to BOTOX detox. "

14:35.257 --> 14:36.747
Everyone laughed and laughed,

14:36.825 --> 14:40.818
but, of course, you couldn't tell
'cause none of their faces were moving.

14:41.230 --> 14:43.095
That's pretty funny, Mom.

14:43.799 --> 14:44.959
Listen...

14:45.234 --> 14:47.327
Right. You wanted to tell me something.

14:47.436 --> 14:50.132
Yeah. Maybe you should sit down.

14:51.173 --> 14:54.267
What now? You got some girl pregnant?

14:55.010 --> 14:57.069
You're gay? You're on drugs?

14:57.146 --> 14:58.909
$10 says pregnant.

14:59.682 --> 15:01.650
- Jake, go to your room.
- I'm giving odds.

15:01.750 --> 15:02.910
Go.

15:04.653 --> 15:06.985
Okay. Here's the thing.

15:10.793 --> 15:12.124
Would you like a drink?

15:12.194 --> 15:14.822
I suppose. A screwdriver might be nice.

15:19.034 --> 15:20.695
I can't go through with this, Alan.

15:20.803 --> 15:23.328
Sure you can. She'll make
a couple of snide comments

15:23.439 --> 15:27.136
about your frivolous lifestyle, which
luckily, she doesn't know the half of.

15:27.209 --> 15:31.111
You'll just suck it up, pay her back
in a couple of months and that'll be that.

15:31.180 --> 15:35.048
With Mom, "that" is never "that. "
The guilt is always there.

15:35.284 --> 15:38.481
To this day, she still reminds me
how much she had to sacrifice

15:38.554 --> 15:40.317
just so I could get braces.

15:40.389 --> 15:44.689
Like I deliberately had crooked teeth
so she'd be forced to drive a domestic car.

15:44.927 --> 15:47.452
- All right, then just drop it.
- It's dropped.

15:47.529 --> 15:48.621
- Don't ask her.
- I won't.

15:48.697 --> 15:49.789
- Let it go.
- It's gone.

15:49.865 --> 15:52.197
By the way,
they're about to repossess your Jaguar.

15:52.301 --> 15:53.632
Mommy?

15:57.272 --> 15:58.603
Very nice.

16:00.275 --> 16:01.674
So, how much do you need?

16:01.777 --> 16:04.678
I admit that my lifestyle
has been a little frivolous

16:04.780 --> 16:08.181
and I probably should have been
paying closer attention to my expenses.

16:08.283 --> 16:10.046
All right. How much do you need?

16:10.152 --> 16:13.019
This is just a temporary thing,
couple of months.

16:13.122 --> 16:15.022
- How much?
- You'll get it back.

16:15.124 --> 16:18.321
This isn't like the braces
and the Mercury Capri.

16:18.627 --> 16:20.959
Charlie, give me a number.

16:38.981 --> 16:40.471
I really appreciate this, Mom.

16:40.549 --> 16:42.915
No more need be said.

16:44.053 --> 16:46.044
You'll pay it back when you can.

16:46.155 --> 16:47.315
Thanks.

16:47.589 --> 16:51.923
All right. Now that that's taken care of,
why don't I take my boys out to dinner?

16:52.027 --> 16:53.392
There it is!

16:54.530 --> 16:56.225
Everything's got a price.

16:57.299 --> 16:58.789
- Charlie, what are you...
- No.

16:58.867 --> 17:01.995
She can't just do something nice,
there's gotta be strings attached.

17:02.071 --> 17:05.165
Nothing's given out of love.
Everything's got a hook in it!

17:05.240 --> 17:08.539
You can keep your money, lady,
because I'm a free man,

17:08.644 --> 17:10.578
and I can't be bought.

17:11.980 --> 17:15.176
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go hide my car.

17:30.666 --> 17:33.430
<i>They're gonna take my Jag away</i>

17:37.339 --> 17:40.069
Charlie, can I talk to you for a minute?

17:40.843 --> 17:42.140
I guess.

17:47.182 --> 17:48.911
How come it's so dark in here?

17:49.017 --> 17:51.508
Do you have any idea how much
electricity costs?

17:51.587 --> 17:52.713
No.

17:52.821 --> 17:56.154
I didn't, either,
but it turns out it's quite a racket.

17:56.725 --> 17:57.817
Listen.

17:57.893 --> 18:01.488
I know you're going through a tough time
and I really wanna help you out.

18:01.563 --> 18:03.929
So, please take this.

18:07.169 --> 18:11.196
This is a cashier's check.
Where did you get a cashier's check?

18:11.273 --> 18:13.400
From my dad's bank, silly.

18:14.376 --> 18:16.207
Your dad owns a bank?

18:16.879 --> 18:21.509
Not all by himself.
Me and my brother and sister own 49บบ.

18:22.251 --> 18:23.548
Really?

18:25.454 --> 18:26.716
What about your mom?

18:26.922 --> 18:28.514
She doesn't have a bank.

18:28.590 --> 18:30.558
- I see.
- She's in oil.

18:35.430 --> 18:38.627
- So you really have...
- Yep, more than God.

18:40.602 --> 18:43.366
Didn't figure that when you dumped me,
did you?

18:44.740 --> 18:46.765
Rose, it wouldn't have mattered.

18:46.875 --> 18:50.709
I know.
That's one of the things I love about you.

18:50.779 --> 18:54.044
You discard women
regardless of their financial status.

18:56.852 --> 18:59.719
Thanks. But I can't take this.

18:59.788 --> 19:02.188
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

19:04.259 --> 19:06.250
My dad and brother said I was crazy,

19:06.361 --> 19:11.264
but I think that was to form a power block
to squeeze me off the Board of Directors.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.224
Shame on them.

19:15.704 --> 19:18.605
I told them that you'd help me
if I needed it.

19:18.707 --> 19:22.541
I mean, you're the first guy I've ever met
who hasn't cared about my money.

19:22.611 --> 19:26.547
Who slept with me because he was drunk,
not because I was rich.

19:30.619 --> 19:34.783
I only wanted to help you
because I thought that we were friends.

19:35.290 --> 19:37.986
Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I am crazy.

19:38.093 --> 19:42.223
No, Rose, it's fine. I am your friend.

19:42.297 --> 19:45.425
And if it means that much to you,
I'll take the money.

19:47.402 --> 19:50.496
Thank you, Charlie.
How can I ever repay you?

19:52.441 --> 19:55.433
Don't worry about it.
And I will pay you back.

19:55.510 --> 19:56.738
I know that.

19:56.812 --> 20:00.805
Better I should owe you
than my manipulating, scheming mother.

20:01.683 --> 20:04.880
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

20:05.387 --> 20:07.753
Hang on, I'll grab you a tissue.

20:07.823 --> 20:09.222
Thank you.

20:45.027 --> 20:46.221
