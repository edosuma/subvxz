07:29.580 --> 07:31.181
WH--UH, WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

07:31.181 --> 07:33.724
STOMACH FLU.

07:33.724 --> 07:44.495
♪♪♪

07:48.939 --> 07:50.100
ZOLA HAS THE STOMACH FLU

07:50.100 --> 07:51.241
AND YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING?

07:51.241 --> 07:52.773
HOW COULD YOU? ARE--ARE YOU
TRYING TO SABOTAGE US ALL?

07:52.773 --> 07:55.075
IT'S NOT LIKE
IT'S THE BLACK PLAGUE.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.507
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
ARE FRIEND.

07:56.507 --> 07:58.248
OH, APRIL, CALM DOWN.
OH...

07:58.248 --> 07:59.750
Y-YOU STAY RIGHT
WHERE YOU ARE, TYPHOID MARY.

07:59.750 --> 08:01.852
COME ON.
LET'S GO REGISTER.

08:01.852 --> 08:04.154
MER, JUST SIT.

08:04.154 --> 08:07.017
AND I'LL GET
YOUR REGISTRATION PACKAGE.

08:07.017 --> 08:09.019
(man) NEXT IN LINE.
(speaks indistinctly)

08:09.019 --> 08:10.521
HEY, DR. ROBBINS,
IT'S ALEX.

08:10.521 --> 08:13.163
UH, LISTEN, I WAS
THINKING ABOUT TOMMY.

08:13.163 --> 08:15.596
UH, HAVE YOU TRIED
LIQUID VENTILATION?

08:15.596 --> 08:17.528
IT'S JUST AN IDEA.
LET ME KNOW.

08:17.528 --> 08:19.269
(beeps)

08:19.269 --> 08:21.101
DUDE, IS THAT YOUR MOM?

08:21.101 --> 08:22.202
(indistinct conversations)

08:22.202 --> 08:23.203
BABY.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.504
OH, NO.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.076
I KNOW.

08:26.076 --> 08:27.277
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE
YOUR MOTHER BEFORE THE BOARDS.

08:27.277 --> 08:28.609
BUT THEY ARE WEARING
THIS OLD GIRL OUT.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.180
GOT ME EXAMINING
THREE SESSIONS TOMORROW,

08:30.180 --> 08:31.742
AND I MIGHT NOT SEE YOU,

08:31.742 --> 08:34.514
SO I HAD TO SAY GOOD LUCK.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.686
OKAY.

08:35.686 --> 08:37.247
MWAH.
THANK YOU, MOM.

08:37.247 --> 08:39.219
OH, AND I BROUGHT IT.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.221
MNH-MNH. NO, NO, THAT'S FINE.
YOU DON'T--

08:41.221 --> 08:43.193
IT'S IN HERE SOMEWHERE.
THAT'S FINE. THAT'S OKAY.

08:43.193 --> 08:44.725
THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS SAY,

08:44.725 --> 08:46.226
BUT YOU ALWAYS WANT IT
IN THE END.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.599
MOM, I'M GOOD. I AM.

08:48.599 --> 08:51.602
I'M IN ROOM 809
WHEN YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.

08:51.602 --> 08:52.763
ALL RIGHT.

08:52.763 --> 08:55.566
ALL RIGHT. EXCUSE ME.

08:55.566 --> 08:56.807
MOMMY BRING YOU
YOUR BINKY?

08:56.807 --> 08:59.309
IT'S MY LUCKY PENCIL.
SHE BROUGHT MY LUCKY PENCIL.

08:59.309 --> 09:00.771
YOU KNOW THIS IS
AN ORAL TEST, RIGHT?

09:00.771 --> 09:02.272
YES, I KNOW, OKAY?

09:02.272 --> 09:03.774
IT'S JUST, I USED IT
FOR MY S.A.T.s,

09:03.774 --> 09:06.246
AND MY M.C.A.T.s,
AND MY INTERN EXAM.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.277
SO IT'S YOUR BINKY.

09:07.277 --> 09:08.649
IT'S...

09:08.649 --> 09:10.550
SORT OF LIKE MY BINKY,
YEAH.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.782
(elevator bell dings)

09:11.782 --> 09:13.283
OKAY.

09:13.283 --> 09:15.155
FILL THIS OUT.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.587
(indistinct conversations
continue)

09:16.587 --> 09:17.557
THERE MUST BE, WHAT,

09:17.557 --> 09:18.729
LIKE A HUNDRED PEOPLE
IN THIS ROOM?

09:18.729 --> 09:19.890
OKAY, IF KEPNER IS RIGHT,

09:19.890 --> 09:21.662
20 OF THEM ARE SCREWED.

09:21.662 --> 09:22.963
I'M GONNA PUKE.
RELAX. YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THEM.

09:22.963 --> 09:25.295
NO, ON YOU.

09:25.295 --> 09:27.297
(indistinct conversations
continue)

09:27.297 --> 09:30.601
(phone rings)

09:30.601 --> 09:32.172
(rings and buzzes)

09:32.172 --> 09:33.243
(beeps)

09:33.243 --> 09:35.245
SO... IT'S HIS BOWEL?

09:35.245 --> 09:36.607
AGAIN?

09:36.607 --> 09:38.348
WE WON'T KNOW HOW BAD IT IS

09:38.348 --> 09:40.210
WITHOUT OPENING HIM UP.

09:40.210 --> 09:43.153
OKAY.

09:43.153 --> 09:44.755
(sighs)

09:44.755 --> 09:46.356
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

09:46.356 --> 09:48.759
MORGAN, WE'VE ALREADY REMOVED
PART OF HIS BOWEL.

09:48.759 --> 09:50.090
THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE

09:50.090 --> 09:51.762
HE WON'T MAKE IT
THROUGH ANOTHER SURGERY.

09:51.762 --> 09:53.363
YOU'VE SAID THAT BEFORE.

09:53.363 --> 09:55.595
A LOT.
WE'LL DO IT.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.297
DO THE SURGERY.

09:57.297 --> 10:00.070
(beeping continues)

10:00.070 --> 10:03.133
WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU
TO PREP AN E.V.R.

10:03.133 --> 10:04.304
ALL RIGHT. WELL, WHY DON'T
YOU OPEN HIM UP,

10:04.304 --> 10:05.836
AND I'LL GET HIM PREPPED?

10:05.836 --> 10:07.277
YOU'RE GONNA FILL HIM
FULL OF BLOOD THINNERS,

10:07.277 --> 10:09.379
HIS ORGANS WILL BLEED OUT BEFORE
WE GET A CHANCE TO SAVE THEM.

10:09.379 --> 10:11.111
HE NEEDS DAMAGE CONTROL.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.612
OPENING HIS CHEST WILL CAUSE
MORE DAMAGE IN THE LONG RUN

10:12.612 --> 10:14.184
THAN WE CAN CONTROL.

10:14.184 --> 10:16.917
SHE'S RIGHT. THIS GIVES HIM
HIS BEST OPTIONS FOR RECOVERY.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.019
THIS SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD COMPROMISE.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.350
DR. HUNT, SIR, NO ONE'S TOLD US

10:20.350 --> 10:21.892
WHAT WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE PREPPING FOR?

10:21.892 --> 10:23.623
LAPAROTOMY.
E.V.R.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.756
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

10:25.756 --> 10:28.759
BOTH. NOW THAT'S A GOOD PLAN.
(slaps hands together)

10:28.759 --> 10:29.930
(sighs)

10:29.930 --> 10:31.061
BOTH.

10:31.061 --> 10:32.863
PREP HIM HEAD TO TOE.

10:32.863 --> 10:34.805
ALL RIGHT THEN.

10:34.805 --> 10:36.767
OKAY, PAGE ME FOR THE TIB-FIB
FRACTURE WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

10:36.767 --> 10:38.368
HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?

10:38.368 --> 10:40.210
OH, YOU WANT TO BE IN THE O.R.
WITH THOSE TWO?

10:40.210 --> 10:41.812
THEY HATE EACH OTHER.

10:41.812 --> 10:42.973
OH, THEY'RE PROFESSIONALS.
THEY'LL BE FINE.

10:42.973 --> 10:44.374
NO, IT'S AWFUL.

10:44.374 --> 10:45.716
IT'S TENSE AND IT'S COLD
AND IT'S DANGEROUS.

10:45.716 --> 10:47.277
IT FEELS LIKE
DEFUSING A BOMB

10:47.277 --> 10:49.980
IN A HAUNTED HOUSE
THAT'S BUILT ON A MINEFIELD,

10:49.980 --> 10:51.321
AND THERE ARE BEARS EVERYWHERE,

10:51.321 --> 10:52.652
AND THE BEARS HAVE KNIVES.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.324
UH, NOW I HAVE TO BE
IN HERE WITH 'EM

10:54.324 --> 10:55.926
FOR THE NEXT EIGHT HOURS.

10:55.926 --> 10:57.657
YOU HAVE TO TAME THEM
OR YOU WILL DIE.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.959
WE WILL ALL DIE.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.130
THEIR HATE WILL DESTROY
THE HOSPITAL,

11:00.130 --> 11:01.291
AND THEN THE WHOLE PLANET.

11:01.291 --> 11:02.662
I AM COUNTING ON YOU,
BAILEY.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.394
WE'RE ALL COUNTING ON YOU.

11:04.394 --> 11:06.336
GODSPEED.

11:06.336 --> 11:08.098
(door opens)

11:08.098 --> 11:09.339
(door closes)

11:09.339 --> 11:10.701
(sighs)

11:10.701 --> 11:12.342
(cable car bell dings)

11:12.342 --> 11:16.907
OKAY, 56 YEAR OLD PRESENTS WITH
PANCREATIC DUCTAL OBSTRUCTION...

11:16.907 --> 11:18.078
(cell phone beeps)

11:18.078 --> 11:20.350
AND DILATED
MAIN PANCREATIC DUCT.

11:20.350 --> 11:21.882
POST-OP PROCEDURE...

11:21.882 --> 11:23.183
YES.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.684
(beep)
DUDE, GIVE IT A REST.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.816
IF WE DON'T KNOW IT BY NOW,
WE'RE SCREWED.

11:25.816 --> 11:27.257
BESIDES, YOU'VE GOT
YOUR MAGICAL PENCIL

11:27.257 --> 11:28.418
TO SEE YOU THROUGH.

11:28.418 --> 11:31.161
HE'S GOT A MAGIC PENCIL?
OH, SAY MORE.

11:31.161 --> 11:32.993
HIS MOMMY BROUGHT IT.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.265
WAIT. HOW MAGICAL
IS THIS PENCIL?

11:35.265 --> 11:37.027
AND CAN IT STOP THAT?

11:37.027 --> 11:38.468
(crying) I'M SORRY.

11:38.468 --> 11:40.270
I'M SORRY.
THIS ALL JUST GOT

11:40.270 --> 11:42.232
REALLY, REALLY REAL.

11:42.232 --> 11:43.403
AND MAN DOWN.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.005
TWO MEN DOWN.
FIRST GREY, NOW--

11:45.005 --> 11:46.406
MEREDITH'S NOT DOWN.
SHE'S FINE.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.408
WHOA. SHUT UP.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.940
DR. ROBBINS.
Karev,

11:49.940 --> 11:51.341
WHY DO YOU KEEP CALLING ME?

11:51.341 --> 11:53.013
WELL, YOU DON'T ANSWER
MY TEXTS.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.015
I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF YOU GOT
TOMMY'S X-RAYS BACK YET.
Yes. Okay?

11:55.015 --> 11:56.716
YES, AND YOUR HUNCH
WAS CORRECT.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.388
HIS NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS
HAS RETURNED.

11:58.388 --> 12:00.791
IS MORGAN, UH, ARE--
ARE YOU GONNA OPERATE?

12:00.791 --> 12:01.992
Yeah.

12:01.992 --> 12:04.424
IN A FEW HOURS.
WE'RE PREPPING HIM SOON.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.196
LISTEN, I WILL TEXT YOU
WHEN I--
(beep)

12:06.196 --> 12:07.858
WAIT. KAREV?

12:07.858 --> 12:09.029
I GOTTA GO.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.260
GO WHERE, TO EAT?

12:10.260 --> 12:12.332
NO, I GOTTA GO
BACK TO SEATTLE.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.164
(door opens)

12:14.164 --> 12:15.335
(door closes)

12:15.335 --> 12:16.506
(cries) WHAT?

12:21.471 --> 12:22.843
(cell phone rings and buzzes)

12:22.843 --> 12:24.014
(rings and buzzes)

12:24.014 --> 12:25.175
(blows air)

12:25.175 --> 12:26.777
(rings and buzzes)

12:26.777 --> 12:28.518
(rings and buzzes)

12:28.518 --> 12:30.951
(rings and buzzes)

12:30.951 --> 12:32.122
(beeps)

12:32.122 --> 12:33.323
HI.

12:33.323 --> 12:35.325
YEAH, NO, JUST--
SORRY, I WAS NAPPING.

12:35.325 --> 12:38.258
I'M JUST, UH, I-I FEEL
A LITTLE TIRED IS ALL.
(Zola crying)

12:38.258 --> 12:39.429
HOW'S ZOLA?

12:39.429 --> 12:40.791
(continues crying)

12:40.791 --> 12:41.761
HER FEVER'S DOWN TO 100.
STOP WORRYING.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.533
I can hear her
screaming, Derek.

12:43.533 --> 12:45.465
NO, NO, SHE'S SCREAMING, "GO,
MAMA. KICK BUTT ON THE BOARDS."
(continues crying)

12:45.465 --> 12:47.097
IS SHE REALLY FEELING BETTER?
Yeah, you hear that?

12:47.097 --> 12:48.839
(Zola coughs)
SHE STOPPED CRYING.

12:48.839 --> 12:50.540
And now she's smiling

12:50.540 --> 12:52.202
THAT CUTE LITTLE SMILE
SHE DOES.
(cries)

12:52.202 --> 12:53.944
OH, YEAH.
I LOVE THAT SMILE.

12:53.944 --> 12:55.475
YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT
FOR TOMORROW?
Tomorrow? Yeah.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.848
I FEEL GREAT.
Listen, I made some calls.

12:57.848 --> 12:59.179
THERE IS AN OPENING
AT MASS GENERAL,

12:59.179 --> 13:00.350
AND WE COULD DO THIS.

13:00.350 --> 13:02.312
And Zola could grow up

13:02.312 --> 13:04.214
WITH A BOSTON ACCENT.
Whoa.

13:04.214 --> 13:06.887
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I WANT
THE JOB AT THE BRIGHAM.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.788
AND I HAVEN'T PASSED
MY TEST YET.
You will.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.220
(keypad beeping)
OH, DON'T TOUCH THE BUTTONS.

13:10.220 --> 13:11.391
Zola, I'm talking to
your m--

13:11.391 --> 13:12.562
(dial tone drones)

13:12.562 --> 13:13.894
(knock on door)
(sighs)

13:13.894 --> 13:15.465
(beep)

13:15.465 --> 13:17.327
(blows air)

13:17.327 --> 13:18.999
(groans)

13:18.999 --> 13:20.130
(gags)

13:22.032 --> 13:23.904
(knock)

13:23.904 --> 13:25.405
WH--

13:32.382 --> 13:33.383
NICE.

13:33.383 --> 13:34.915
I DON'T TAKE CHANCES.

13:34.915 --> 13:35.916
(sighs)

13:35.916 --> 13:37.417
MY KID JUST HUNG UP ON ME.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.850
YEAH,
THAT'LL HAPPEN AGAIN.

13:41.521 --> 13:44.855
W-WHERE DID YOU GET
AN I.V. AND FLUIDS?

13:44.855 --> 13:47.057
I'M A DOCTOR IN A HOTEL
FULL OF DOCTORS.

13:47.057 --> 13:48.498
ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVE.

13:48.498 --> 13:50.000
YOU'RE A NICE PERSON.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.231
AH, DON'T GET ALL MISTY.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.933
I'M OUTTA HERE
IN 60 SECONDS.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.034
THIS ROOM
IS LIKE A VIRAL CESSPOOL.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.435
OW.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.207
I TAKE THAT BACK.

13:58.838 --> 14:02.612
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:02.612 --> 14:06.516
ALL RIGHT. FLUORO OUT.

14:06.516 --> 14:07.978
OKAY.

14:07.978 --> 14:11.321
WHERE WERE WE?
CLAMP, PLEASE.

14:11.321 --> 14:13.853
I HOPE THAT WAS WORTH IT.
(suction gurgling)

14:13.853 --> 14:15.425
HEY, JUST CHECKING IN.
ALMOST DONE?

14:15.425 --> 14:17.527
ALMOST, BUT YOU SHOULD
ASK ALTMAN.

14:17.527 --> 14:19.329
UH, SHE USUALLY
DISAGREES WITH ME.

14:19.329 --> 14:22.332
I NEED TO CHECK
THE FINAL POSITION OF THE GRAFT

14:22.332 --> 14:24.034
SO, YEAH, I DISAGREE
WITH HUNT.

14:24.034 --> 14:25.635
OKAY THEN.

14:25.635 --> 14:27.467
I DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT
THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING HERE,

14:27.467 --> 14:29.269
FIXING THE PROBLEMS
THAT WE ALL WANT FIXED,

14:29.269 --> 14:31.041

14:31.041 --> 14:32.542
SO, UH, I'LL BE BACK.

14:32.542 --> 14:34.044
UH, YOU COULD STAY.

14:34.044 --> 14:36.606
THERE--THERE'S ROOM.
STAY!

14:36.606 --> 14:39.609
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

14:39.609 --> 14:42.552
(indistinct conversations)

14:42.552 --> 14:44.985
(crunches)
YOU MIND IF I JOIN YOU?

14:44.985 --> 14:45.956
NO. UH, PLEASE.

14:45.956 --> 14:48.058
I SENT MY IDIOT INTERN
TO GET ME LUNCH.

14:48.058 --> 14:49.659
I TOLD HIM TO GET ME ANYTHING
BUT LENTIL SOUP.

14:49.659 --> 14:52.022

22:25.675 --> 22:27.717
I--THIS IS OUR LAST NIGHT
AS RESIDENTS.

22:27.717 --> 22:29.048
LET'S HOPE.

22:29.048 --> 22:31.621
NO, STOP THAT! YOU JUST
STOP DOUBTING YOURSELF.

22:31.621 --> 22:33.553
WE FREAKIN' KICKED
THAT GUY'S ASS IN THERE.

22:33.553 --> 22:34.924
WE ARE GONNA
KICK THIS TEST'S ASS.

22:34.924 --> 22:36.386
HOW COME YOU'RE SO CONFIDENT
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

22:36.386 --> 22:38.458
I'M A SOLDIER.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.059
YEAH, I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS, BUT--

22:40.059 --> 22:42.762
♪ IT'S ALL, ALL, ALL, ALL ♪

22:42.762 --> 22:45.064
MM. APRIL.

22:45.064 --> 22:47.036
SHOULD I
NOT HAVE DONE THAT?

22:47.036 --> 22:48.798
I, UM...

22:48.798 --> 22:50.870
I...

22:50.870 --> 22:53.903
IF YOU WANT ME TO STOP,
JUST SAY SO,

22:53.903 --> 22:55.905
AND I'LL STOP.

22:55.905 --> 22:58.077
I JUST--YOU'RE...

22:58.077 --> 23:00.510
THE WAY YOU'RE KISSING ME
RIGHT NOW, YOU JUST--

23:00.510 --> 23:01.851
(whispers) YOU'RE A VIRGIN.
YOU'RE A VIRGIN.

23:01.851 --> 23:04.554
YES, BECAUSE MY WHOLE LIFE
SINCE I WAS A KID,

23:04.554 --> 23:07.987
I HAD THIS IDEA OF HOW
MY LIFE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE,

23:07.987 --> 23:10.690
THESE RULES THAT I WAS
SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW,

23:10.690 --> 23:12.391
BUT I'M NOT A KID.

23:12.391 --> 23:15.064
I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON I WAS
WHEN I STARTED MY RESIDENCY.

23:15.064 --> 23:17.727
I JUST PUNCHED A GUY.

23:17.727 --> 23:19.699
(laughs)
AND IT FELT REALLY GOOD.

23:19.699 --> 23:22.832
AND IF SOMETHING FEELS
REALLY, REALLY GOOD,

23:22.832 --> 23:24.874
IT CAN'T BE BAD, RIGHT?

23:24.874 --> 23:26.876
I, UH...

23:26.876 --> 23:29.739
JACKSON, HEY.

23:29.739 --> 23:33.082
IT'S OKAY.

23:33.082 --> 23:34.984
REALLY.

23:34.984 --> 23:36.446
IT'S OKAY.

23:39.889 --> 23:41.020
♪ IT'S ALL ♪

23:41.020 --> 23:42.191
I'M JUST SAYING,

23:42.191 --> 23:43.723
IF JACKSON
DOESN'T PASS TOMORROW,

23:43.723 --> 23:46.996
I'M HOLDING YOU
PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE.

23:46.996 --> 23:50.129
WELL, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT JACKSON.

23:50.129 --> 23:53.102
HE KEPT HIS HEAD DOWN.

23:53.102 --> 23:56.065
HE'S IN GOOD SHAPE.

23:56.065 --> 23:58.007
AND HOW ABOUT YOU?

23:58.007 --> 23:59.939
HOW'S ADELE?

23:59.939 --> 24:02.141
OKAY, I THINK.

24:02.141 --> 24:03.973
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
IN A WHILE.

24:03.973 --> 24:05.975
IT CONFUSES HER
MORE THAN ANYTHING

24:05.975 --> 24:07.477
WHEN I'M THERE.

24:07.477 --> 24:10.119
HOW ARE YOU WITH THAT?

24:10.119 --> 24:11.481
(clicks tongue)

24:11.481 --> 24:15.024
IT... IT'S THE RIGHT THING.

24:15.024 --> 24:16.926
ACTUALLY...

24:16.926 --> 24:18.858
SHE'S HAPPIER.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.760
(people speaking indistinctly)

24:20.760 --> 24:22.592
AT OUR AGE, YOU WOULD THINK

24:22.592 --> 24:25.835
WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO
GROW UP ANYMORE, HUH?

24:25.835 --> 24:28.868
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

24:28.868 --> 24:30.169
(door hisses)

24:30.169 --> 24:32.171
HEY. HOW ARE WE
DOING IN HERE?

24:32.171 --> 24:34.704
I AM NOT THE PROBLEM.
HE IS.

24:34.704 --> 24:36.976
I MEAN, HE IS COMPLETELY
UNWILLING TO COLLABORATE.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.248
HE SHOULD'VE BEEN IN HERE
FIXING THAT LEAK.

24:39.248 --> 24:40.610
OH, BUT, NO.

24:40.610 --> 24:43.853
HE IS JUST NOT WILLING
TO EVEN HEAR ME.

24:43.853 --> 24:45.555
I MEAN, IT'S OBSTRUCTING
PATIENT CARE...

24:45.555 --> 24:47.086
REALLY?
YOU HAD EIGHT HOURS.

24:47.086 --> 24:48.588
(tsks) WHY IS THIS ON ME?

24:48.588 --> 24:51.120
WELL, BECAUSE SHE'LL
LISTEN TO YOU.

24:51.120 --> 24:54.624
AND BECAUSE I ORGANIZED
LADIES NIGHT. IT'S YOUR TURN.

24:54.624 --> 24:55.965
...JUMP IN
AND SAVE THE DAY AGAIN.

24:55.965 --> 24:57.867
I CAN'T WORK WITH HIM IF HE IS
GONNA FIGHT ME

24:57.867 --> 24:59.969
ON EVERY SINGLE THING.

24:59.969 --> 25:02.532
OKAY,
HE IS NOT FIGHTING YOU.

25:02.532 --> 25:04.273
HE DISAGREED WITH YOU
ON A COURSE OF TREATMENT.

25:04.273 --> 25:06.636
THAT IS SOMETHING
DOCTORS DO.

25:06.636 --> 25:07.977
BUT YOU DON'T SEE HIM
AS A DOCTOR.

25:07.977 --> 25:10.039
YOU ONLY SEE HIM
AS THE MAN YOU BLAME

25:10.039 --> 25:12.542
FOR THE DEATH OF YOUR HUSBAND.

25:12.542 --> 25:15.645
AND YOU KNOW AND I KNOW,
THAT WAS NOT HIS FAULT.

25:15.645 --> 25:17.146
BUT HE'S ACCEPTED THAT BLAME

25:17.146 --> 25:18.818
BECAUSE HE THINKS
IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER.

25:18.818 --> 25:20.650
HE'S NOT FIGHTING YOU.

25:20.650 --> 25:23.122
BUT YOU KEEP FIGHTING HIM.

25:23.122 --> 25:26.055
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

25:27.897 --> 25:29.128
HE LOST YOU.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.100
HE LOST HIS FRIEND,

25:31.100 --> 25:32.231
AND NOW HE'S PROBABLY
LOSING HIS WIFE.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.663
HIS WORLD IS FALLING APART.

25:33.663 --> 25:36.235
SO I HOPE BLAMING HIM
IS HELPING YOU,

25:36.235 --> 25:39.168
'CAUSE IT
SURE ISN'T HELPING HIM.

25:40.610 --> 25:41.771
(door hisses)

25:49.719 --> 25:50.980
I'VE TURNED OFF
HIS PRESSORS

25:50.980 --> 25:52.952
SO WE WON'T BE ABLE TO MANAGE
HIS BLOOD PRESSURE ANYMORE,

25:52.952 --> 25:55.154
AND HIS T.P.N. AND HIS FLUIDS,

25:55.154 --> 25:58.027
SO HE WON'T BE GETTING
ANY MORE NUTRITION.

25:58.027 --> 25:59.158
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

25:59.158 --> 26:00.630
YOU OKAY?

26:00.630 --> 26:02.231
(sniffles)

26:02.231 --> 26:04.664
(beeping continues)

26:04.664 --> 26:05.995
I'M GONNA TURN OFF
HIS VENTILATOR

26:05.995 --> 26:08.267
AND REMOVE HIS E.T. TUBE.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.670
(cries)

26:10.670 --> 26:12.041
DO YOU NEED A MINUTE?

26:12.041 --> 26:15.044
(beeping continues)

26:17.176 --> 26:19.008
(switch clicks,
ventilator powers down)

26:19.008 --> 26:21.651
(beeps)

26:23.112 --> 26:24.954
(air hisses)

26:30.259 --> 26:33.763
(labored breathing)

26:41.971 --> 26:44.033
HIS BREATHING
WILL SLOW DOWN

26:44.033 --> 26:46.035
AND HIS HEART
WILL EVENTUALLY STOP.

26:46.035 --> 26:49.809
IT MAY TAKE MINUTES.
IT MAY TAKE HOURS.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.811
(crying)

26:51.811 --> 26:53.643
(sniffles)

26:53.643 --> 26:56.646
(labored breathing
continues)

27:04.053 --> 27:05.795
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

27:05.795 --> 27:07.797
I'VE EVER REALLY BEEN ABLE
TO HOLD HIM...

27:07.797 --> 27:08.958
(cries)

27:08.958 --> 27:11.400
WITHOUT THE TUBES
AND JUNK.

27:11.400 --> 27:14.403
IT'S NICE.

27:14.403 --> 27:17.366
STAY.

27:17.366 --> 27:18.938
PLEASE.

27:18.938 --> 27:22.041
(labored breathing
continues)

27:32.952 --> 27:34.123
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

27:34.123 --> 27:35.324
HEY.

27:35.324 --> 27:36.856
AH, WE MEET AGAIN.

27:36.856 --> 27:39.088
HEY.
(chuckles) THANKS.

27:39.088 --> 27:40.860
MM-HMM.
UH, BY THE WAY,

27:40.860 --> 27:41.991
IT WASN'T ME, WAS IT?

27:41.991 --> 27:42.962
WHAT?

27:42.962 --> 27:44.363
THAT SPLIT YOU TWO UP--

27:44.363 --> 27:46.065
THE FACT THAT AVERY AND I
ARE WORKING TOGETHER,

27:46.065 --> 27:47.967
THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO
SEE ME ALL THE TIME?

27:47.967 --> 27:49.939
I MEAN, I DON'T--I DON'T
MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE, DO I?

27:49.939 --> 27:51.070
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.872
I... NO, YOU DON'T.

27:52.872 --> 27:55.344
GREAT,
BECAUSE THIS IS NICE.

27:55.344 --> 27:57.777
TALKING TO YOU--
I MISS IT.

27:57.777 --> 27:58.948
I MISS YOU.

27:58.948 --> 28:01.280
I MISS YOU, TOO.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.782
AND...

28:02.782 --> 28:04.453
(people speaking indistinctly)

28:04.453 --> 28:07.156
THE REASON THAT JACKSON
AND I BROKE UP, IT--

28:07.156 --> 28:08.818
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE DON'T
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

28:08.818 --> 28:10.419
IT'S REALLY--IT'S NONE OF
MY BUSINESS SO FORGET I ASKED.

28:10.419 --> 28:11.961
WE CAN BE FRIENDS

28:11.961 --> 28:15.024
WHO DON'T TALK ABOUT
THAT STUFF, EVER.

28:15.024 --> 28:17.696
OKAY.

28:17.696 --> 28:21.400
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

28:21.400 --> 28:24.233
OH, BUT AS YOUR FRIEND,

28:24.233 --> 28:26.135
IF YOU'RE NOT OVER HIM,

28:26.135 --> 28:27.436
YOU SHOULD TELL HIM,

28:27.436 --> 28:30.479
BECAUSE SERIOUSLY,
YOU GUYS ARE GREAT TOGETHER.

28:32.782 --> 28:34.113
THANKS.

28:34.113 --> 28:36.385
DON'T STAY TOO LATE.

28:36.385 --> 28:40.119
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

28:40.119 --> 28:42.121
AND I LOOK JUST TO THE LEFT
OF THEIR HEAD.

28:42.121 --> 28:43.492
IT FREAKS 'EM OUT.
(laughs)

28:43.492 --> 28:44.854
YOU ARE TERRIBLE.

28:44.854 --> 28:46.125
OH, COME ON, NOW.

28:46.125 --> 28:48.928
YOU GONNA TRY AND TELL ME
YOU'RE ALL WARM AND MATERNAL?

28:48.928 --> 28:52.231
I AM SUPPORTIVE
AND I'M ENCOURAGING.

28:52.231 --> 28:55.264
MM-HMM. I'VE WATCHED YOU
WITH YOUR STUDENTS.

28:55.264 --> 28:56.836
I KNOW YOUR MOVES.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.167
(laughs)
OH, DO YOU NOW?

28:58.167 --> 28:59.138
I CERTAINLY DO.

28:59.138 --> 29:00.469
I DON'T KNOW.

29:00.469 --> 29:04.073
I MAY HAVE A MOVE OR TWO
THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN.

31:18.347 --> 31:22.281
THAT WAS REALLY GREAT.
THAT WAS REALLY--

31:22.281 --> 31:24.583
(laughs) YEAH. YES. YES.
YES, THAT WAS...

31:24.583 --> 31:27.286

31:39.198 --> 31:40.499

31:40.499 --> 31:41.630

31:43.002 --> 31:45.204
(chuckles)

31:45.204 --> 31:46.335

31:46.335 --> 31:50.539
YEAH, I'M FINE.
I'M JUST... TIRED.

31:50.539 --> 31:52.141
(chuckles) YEAH.

31:52.141 --> 31:54.984
YEAH.

31:54.984 --> 31:56.545
YOU SHOULD GET SOME SLEEP.

31:56.545 --> 31:59.618

I SHOULD GET SOME SLEEP.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.623
YEAH.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.695
YEAH.

32:06.695 --> 32:08.527
OR...

32:08.527 --> 32:11.330
OR YOU COULD GO.

32:11.330 --> 32:13.432
DON'T YOU HAVE TO GET

32:17.967 --> 32:19.138
RIGHT.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.270
YEAH.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

32:21.270 --> 32:23.012
I COULD GO IF YOU WANT.
