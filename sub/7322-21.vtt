WEBVTT

00:02.473 --> 00:05.536
(Meredith) THE SKIN IS
THE LARGEST ORGAN IN THE BODY.

00:05.536 --> 00:08.008
IT PROTECTS US,
HOLDS US TOGETHER...

00:08.008 --> 00:10.511
LITERALLY LETS US KNOW
WHAT WE ARE FEELING.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.513
UH, REACTION, OBSERVATION,
COMMUNICATION--

00:12.513 --> 00:15.316
ANY QUESTIONS SO FAR?

00:15.316 --> 00:16.687
(residents speak indistinctly)

00:16.687 --> 00:19.050
(sighs) WE ARE DOING THIS
BECAUSE CHIEF SHEPHERD

00:19.050 --> 00:21.792
SUGGESTS WE BRUSH UP ON OUR
PATIENT SENSITIVITY SKILLS,

00:21.792 --> 00:23.494
THAT'S WHY.

00:23.494 --> 00:27.558
AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS, THIS
MORNING WAS A VERY GOOD TIME,

00:27.558 --> 00:30.131
BESIDES, HALF OF YOU
WERE RAISED BY WOLVES.

00:30.131 --> 00:33.804
REACTION.

00:33.804 --> 00:36.267
"KEEP YOUR FACE IMPASSIVE.

00:36.267 --> 00:39.340
"WHETHER PROMPTED BY A PATIENT'S
APPEARANCE OR LAB RESULTS,

00:39.340 --> 00:42.343
"FACIAL EXPRESSIONS OF SURPRISE,
CONCERN, DISGUST, ETCETERA

00:42.343 --> 00:44.515
CAN BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE."

00:44.515 --> 00:46.677
UH, LA LA LA LA LA...

00:46.677 --> 00:49.049
JOKES.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.781
DON'T MAKE JOKES
ABOUT PATIENTS,

00:50.781 --> 00:53.124
NOT IN FRONT OF THEM,
NOT EVEN IN PRIVATE.

00:53.124 --> 00:54.785
WELL...
YANG?

00:54.785 --> 00:57.488
WHAT IF THE JOKE
IS REALLY FUNNY?
IT'S NOT.

00:57.488 --> 00:59.660
(residents laugh)
NEITHER WAS THAT ONE.
MOVING ON.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.733
WE ASSESS QUICKLY IN THE E.R.
AND GO TO RADIOLOGY.
WHAT IF HE
HAS TO BE ADMITTED?

01:02.733 --> 01:05.396
CAN WE GET TO
THE SURGICAL ELEVATOR?
WHAT ABOUT
THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR?

01:05.396 --> 01:07.398
RICHARD, ARE WE SET UP
FOR THIS?

01:07.398 --> 01:09.600
I MEAN, OUR TABLES...
DO WE HAVE ENOUGH?

01:09.600 --> 01:13.204
I DON'T KNOW. IS OUR EQUIPMENT
GONNA BE STRONG ENOUGH?
WELL,
THEY'RE FIVE MINUTES OUT.

01:13.204 --> 01:15.746
WE'LL HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT
AS WE GO.

01:15.746 --> 01:18.179
THE SKIN CAN BE SOFT
AND VULNERABLE...

01:18.179 --> 01:22.082
HIGHLY SENSITIVE...
EASY TO BREAK.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.855
IS THAT GARY CLARK?
HE'S FILED A WRONGFUL DEATH SUIT
IN HIS WIFE'S CASE.

01:24.855 --> 01:26.457
I'M BEING DEPOSED TODAY.

01:26.457 --> 01:28.819
CHIEF SHEPHERD. HI.
YEAH, HI.
WHATEVER YOU'RE SELLING,

01:28.819 --> 01:32.092
JUST LEAVE THE SAMPLES
IN MY OFFICE. THANK YOU.
I'M NOT A DRUG REP.
I'M YOUR LAWYER. LAUREN TURNER.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.865
GO. DON'T WORRY.
I GOT THIS.
OKAY.

01:34.865 --> 01:36.367
THANK YOU.
DR. SHEPHERD, LAUREN.

01:36.367 --> 01:37.868
LET'S--FOLLOW ME, PLEASE.

01:37.868 --> 01:39.870
OBSERVATION.

01:39.870 --> 01:42.133
(pager beeps)
YEAH.

01:42.133 --> 01:43.804
AH.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.776
OKAY, "USE REFLECTIVE LISTENING,

01:45.776 --> 01:47.778
REPEAT THE PATIENT'S FEELINGS
BACK TO THEM."

01:47.778 --> 01:50.711
"UM, I HEAR THAT YOU'RE
CONCERNED ABOUT THE SURGERY.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.713
LET ME EXPLAIN THE RISKS."

01:52.713 --> 01:55.216
"I CAN SEE YOU LIKE VEGETABLES.

01:55.216 --> 01:57.418
AFTER SURGERY,
YOU MIGHT BECOME ONE."
(laughing)

01:57.418 --> 02:00.551
COMMUNICATION.

02:00.551 --> 02:01.852
UH, "DON'T USE JARGON.

02:01.852 --> 02:03.854
"USE LANGUAGE THAT THE PATIENT
CAN UNDERSTAND.

02:03.854 --> 02:07.398
BE CREATIVE
IN USING METAPHORS."
(Charles) OH, I'M TERRIBLE
WITH METAPHORS.

02:07.398 --> 02:09.400
I CAN NEVER COME UP WITH 'EM.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.402
WHY, 'CAUSE YOU'RE DUMB
AS A BOX OF HAMMERS?

02:11.402 --> 02:13.404
YOU SEE, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

02:13.404 --> 02:15.806
YOU'RE AN ASS,
BUT THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.
"BE CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE.

02:15.806 --> 02:17.768
"EXPLAIN ALL RISKS
AND ALL PROBABLE OUTCOMES,

02:17.768 --> 02:21.212
LEAVING NOTHING OUT."
QUESTION--ADAMSON?
WHY ARE YOU GOING SO FAST?

02:21.212 --> 02:24.215
IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT WE HAVE
AN EMERGENT PATIENT ARRIVING

02:24.215 --> 02:26.847
WHO WILL NEED
A LITTLE EXTRA SENSITIVITY.

02:26.847 --> 02:30.181
SO REMEMBER TO EMPLOY YOUR...

02:30.181 --> 02:32.623
R-O-C,

02:32.623 --> 02:35.486
AND YOU WILL--HMM--
ROCK YOUR PATIENT'S WORLD.

02:35.486 --> 02:38.889
(residents groan and laugh)
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT.
FOLLOW ME TO THE PIT.

02:38.889 --> 02:40.391
HUSTLE!

02:40.391 --> 02:42.863
THE SKIN DOESN'T MATTER
TO A SURGEON.

02:42.863 --> 02:45.566
WE'LL CUT RIGHT THROUGH IT,
GO INSIDE...

02:45.566 --> 02:47.568
FIND OUT
THE SECRETS UNDERNEATH.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.201
SO DID YOU GET
IZZIE'S MESSAGE?

02:50.201 --> 02:53.244
DID YOU SIGN
THE DIVORCE PAPERS?
YEAH, I GOTTA FIND 'EM,
AND THEN I'LL SEND 'EM.

02:53.244 --> 02:54.875
IZZIE SENT YOU
DIVORCE PAPERS?

02:54.875 --> 02:57.248
YEAH. SO?
(siren wailing)

02:57.248 --> 03:00.411
NOTHING. JUST--CONGRATULATIONS.
OR... SOMETHING.

03:00.411 --> 03:01.952
EXCUSE ME.

03:01.952 --> 03:03.914
IT TAKES DELICACY
AND SENSITIVITY.

03:03.914 --> 03:06.417
WHAT'S HER PROBLEM?
SHE CARES.
THAT'S HER PROBLEM.

03:06.417 --> 03:08.889
SHE CARES ABOUT YOU.
SHE DOESN'T.
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE A THING.

03:08.889 --> 03:12.723
WELL, YOU SHOULD MAKE IT
A THING OR PUT A STOP TO IT.

03:12.723 --> 03:13.894
(siren whoops)

03:13.894 --> 03:15.866
(horn honks)

03:15.866 --> 03:19.730
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE, REMEMBER
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TAUGHT.

03:19.730 --> 03:21.272
USE IT THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

03:21.272 --> 03:23.934
THERE'LL BE CONSEQUENCES
IF YOU DON'T.

03:23.934 --> 03:25.906
(brakes squeal)

03:25.906 --> 03:28.379
WHAT THE HELL IS IT?
(man) ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.

03:28.379 --> 03:31.242
(men speaking indistinctly)

03:31.242 --> 03:33.914
(Reed) WHAT,
DID THE CIRCUS COME TO TOWN?

03:33.914 --> 03:35.946
(whirring)

03:35.946 --> 03:38.449
NO...
JUST THE ELEPHANT.

03:38.449 --> 03:40.651
AVERY,
YOU'RE OFF THE CASE. GO.

03:40.651 --> 03:42.723
OH... DAMN IT.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.825
CONSEQUENCES.

03:44.825 --> 03:47.258
(emergency radio chatter)

03:47.258 --> 03:49.930
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A BIGGER HOSPITAL.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.503
(laughs)
(gurney clatters)

03:52.503 --> 03:54.765
COMING THROUGH.

03:54.765 --> 03:55.966
(man) ALL RIGHT, ON THREE.
ONE, TWO...

03:55.966 --> 03:59.670
GO! OH!

03:59.670 --> 04:01.412
(Owen) EASY. THAT'S IT.

04:01.412 --> 04:04.615
LET'S GET HIM A CHEM PANEL,
C.B.C. AND L.F.T.s.
(Reed) GOT IT.

04:04.615 --> 04:07.718
(Richard) AND TYPE AND CROSS
FOR TWO UNITS.
NOW DOES THAT HURT?

04:07.718 --> 04:10.020
SWEETHEART,
I CAN'T EVEN FEEL THAT.

04:10.020 --> 04:12.723
I'M HAVING TROUBLE
FINDING A VEIN HERE.
OR ANYWHERE.

04:12.723 --> 04:15.286
I'M USING UP
ALL YOUR DOCTORS HERE.

04:15.286 --> 04:18.659
THERE'S PROBABLY
SOMEBODY DYING SOMEWHERE, RIGHT?

04:18.659 --> 04:20.991
X-RAY.

04:20.991 --> 04:22.633
(whirring)

04:22.633 --> 04:25.035
(lowered voice) NOW I UNDERSTAND
THE SENSITIVITY TRAINING.

04:25.035 --> 04:26.967
YEAH. NO FAT JOKES.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.700
YANG,
YOU'RE OFF THE CASE.
I SAID NO FAT J--

04:29.700 --> 04:31.542
GOOD-BYE.
ARE YOU KIDDING...

04:31.542 --> 04:33.043
(machine clicks and whirs)

04:33.043 --> 04:34.575
CLEAR.

04:34.575 --> 04:35.976
OKAY.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.478
UM, SIR, WHEN DID

04:37.478 --> 04:39.650
THE STOMACH PAINS
BECOME MORE ACUTE?

04:39.650 --> 04:42.853
OH, LAST COUPLE DAYS,
I GUESS.

04:42.853 --> 04:46.016
IT'S HARD TO KEEP TRACK.
I'M A REAL BUSY GUY.
(woman) I'M HERE. I'M HERE.

04:46.016 --> 04:47.888
(Owen) LET'S ROLL HIM.
BOBBY, ARE YOU OKAY?

04:47.888 --> 04:49.660
(grunts)
I'M SORRY. AND YOU ARE?

04:49.660 --> 04:51.922
I'M HIS WIFE.

04:51.922 --> 04:53.564
(Bobby sighs)

04:53.564 --> 04:55.065
(whispers)
FACIAL EXPRESSIONS.

04:55.065 --> 04:57.067
HON, I'M FINE.

04:57.067 --> 04:58.729
MELISSA WORRIES.

04:58.729 --> 05:00.971
SHE LIKES TO MOUNTAINS
OUT OF MOLEHILLS,

05:00.971 --> 05:03.934
AND I'M ALREADY A MOUNTAIN.
(laughing)

05:03.934 --> 05:05.576
(laughs)

05:05.576 --> 05:07.438
(continues laughing)

05:07.438 --> 05:09.910
MAN... TOUGH CROWD.

05:09.910 --> 05:13.444
MR. CORSO, WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO TURN YOU OVER AGAIN.

05:13.444 --> 05:15.416
(sighs)

05:15.416 --> 05:17.087
(grunts)
WHOA, WHOA.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

05:17.087 --> 05:18.889
DR. WEBBER.

05:18.889 --> 05:20.791
LOOK AT THAT.

05:20.791 --> 05:24.355
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

05:26.757 --> 05:29.500
YOU POPPIN' THE HOOD
DOWN THERE?

05:29.500 --> 05:32.062
(laughs)

05:34.064 --> 05:36.106
(whispers) FACIAL EXPRESSIONS.

05:36.106 --> 05:37.768
(Jackson) DR. ALTMAN.

05:37.768 --> 05:39.770
DIBS.
DO YOU NEED
ANY HELP TODAY?

05:39.770 --> 05:42.773
I'M FREE.
AREN'T YOU BOTH ON WEBBER'S
BIG EMERGENT PATIENT?

05:42.773 --> 05:45.776
OH, YEAH, HE GOT KICKED OFF
FOR MAKING A JOKE.
SHE GOT
KICKED OFF, TOO, SO--

05:45.776 --> 05:47.778
FOR NOT MAKING A JOKE,
SO DIBS.

05:47.778 --> 05:50.551
ALL RIGHT, BOTH OF YOU.
I'VE GOT A CONSULT IN THE PIT.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.483
(door opens)

05:52.483 --> 05:54.124
JAMIE ANDERS? HI.

05:54.124 --> 05:56.387
HI.
DR. TORRES.

05:56.387 --> 05:59.730
OOH, WOW. WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO TO YOUR KNEE?

05:59.730 --> 06:02.693
SOME JACKASS MOWED ME DOWN
ON MY BIKE AND THEN TOOK OFF.

06:02.693 --> 06:04.495
OH. HIT-AND-RUN? THAT SUCKS.

06:04.495 --> 06:06.897
OKAY, WELL, THIS IS PROBABLY
GONNA HURT A LITTLE,

06:06.897 --> 06:10.671
BUT... I NEED TO GET IN THERE
AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON, OKAY?
GO FOR IT.

06:10.671 --> 06:13.003
OW. OW. NO, NO, NO.
DON'T GO FOR IT. OH.

06:13.003 --> 06:14.945
SORRY. YOU OKAY?
WOW. THIS REALLY BLOWS.

06:14.945 --> 06:18.709
YEAH, THAT'S ONE
MESSED UP PATELLA.
PLUS, I'M OUT 20 BUCKS.

06:18.709 --> 06:22.052
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
MY FRIEND SAID THERE'S ALWAYS
AN UPSIDE TO AN INJURY,

06:22.052 --> 06:23.814
AND I SAID SHE WAS ON CRACK.

06:23.814 --> 06:25.956
AND SHE SAID, "WATCH,
THE DOCTOR WILL BE HOT."

06:25.956 --> 06:29.019
I SAID, "THE DOCTOR
WILL BE OLD AND GNARLY."
(chuckles)

06:29.019 --> 06:33.564
AND NOW YOU SHOW UP,
WHICH MEANS I OWE HER 20 BUCKS.

06:33.564 --> 06:35.065
(elevator bell dings)

06:35.065 --> 06:36.597
(chuckles)

06:36.597 --> 06:38.098
(monitor beeps)

06:38.098 --> 06:40.601
NANCY TEMPLE, 39, COMPLAINING
OF NAUSEA AND DIZZINESS

06:40.601 --> 06:42.603
SINCE WAKING TODAY.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.974
THEN SHE THREW UP, TWICE.

06:43.974 --> 06:47.508
AND KELLY SAID I HAD TO GO
TO THEDOCTOR, SO... (laughs)

06:47.508 --> 06:51.742
AT SCHOOL, YOU HAVE TO
IF YOU VOMIT.
GOOD CALL, KELLY.
LET'S HAVE A LISTEN.

06:51.742 --> 06:52.943
(machine whirring)

06:52.943 --> 06:55.185
HOW'S HER E.K.G. LOOK?

06:55.185 --> 06:57.918
UH, IT'S COMING UP RIGHT NOW.
ARE YOU HAVING
ANY CHEST PAINS

06:57.918 --> 07:00.491
OR NUMBNESS IN YOUR ARMS
OR FINGERS?

07:00.491 --> 07:02.092
NO, NOT AT ALL.

07:02.092 --> 07:05.055
WHY?
WELL, NANCY,
HEART ATTACK SYMPTOMS

07:05.055 --> 07:07.127
SHOW UP COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY
IN WOMEN THAN IN MEN.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.099
THEY'RE OFTEN MISSED.

07:09.099 --> 07:11.602
SOMETIMES THEY JUST LOOK
LIKE STOMACH PROBLEMS.
ARE YOU SAYING THAT--

07:11.602 --> 07:15.065
YOU'RE HAVING
A HEART ATTACK RIGHT NOW.
OH, MY GOD.

07:15.065 --> 07:17.107
LET'S HANG A NITRO DRIP
AND CALL THE CATH LAB.
MOMMY.

07:17.107 --> 07:19.109
WHAT ABOUT MY DAUGHTER?
WE'RE HERE ALONE.

07:19.109 --> 07:20.971
WE'RE FLYING BACK TO MIAMI
TONIGHT, AND MY HUSBAND NEEDS--

07:20.971 --> 07:23.844
WE'LL CALL YOUR HUSBAND AND LET
HIM KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON,

07:23.844 --> 07:27.117
AND DR. YANG WILL TAKE CARE OF
KELLY UNTIL YOUR TESTS ARE DONE.
MOMMY...

07:27.117 --> 07:30.450
NO. I MEAN, I-I SHOULD--
IT'S PATIENT SENSITIVITY DAY.
RIGHT, DR. YANG?

07:30.450 --> 07:32.653
IT'S NOT A DAY.
TAKE CARE OF KELLY,

07:32.653 --> 07:35.656
AND AVERY WILL PAGE YOU
WHEN WE'RE READY.
MOMMY!

07:35.656 --> 07:38.128
IT'S ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART.

07:38.128 --> 07:40.991
I WANT TO GO WITH HER.
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.

07:40.991 --> 07:43.193
SO DO I.

07:43.193 --> 07:46.637
NOW HOW LONG
HAS HE HAD THAT INFECTION?

07:46.637 --> 07:49.570
OH, I'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE.
NOTHING LIKE THAT.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.642
WHAT--WHAT IS IT?
(Richard) WE DON'T KNOW YET.

07:51.642 --> 07:54.074
IT COULD BE SUPERFICIAL
OR IT MIGHT BE

07:54.074 --> 07:55.976
SOMETHING WORSE
GOING ON INTERNALLY.
I'M GONNA BE FINE, BABY.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.949
OKAY.
DON'T WORRY.

07:58.949 --> 08:00.180
(groans)

08:00.180 --> 08:03.013
KAREV!
CRAP.
I THOUGHT WE'D CLEAR IT.

08:03.013 --> 08:04.815
LET'S TAKE THE SIDES OFF.

08:04.815 --> 08:07.658
YOU SHOULD PUT A "WIDE LOAD"
BANNER ON THIS THING. (laughs)
(laughs)

08:07.658 --> 08:10.761
WE HAVE A GURNEY RIGHT HERE.
CAN WE MOVE HIM ONTO THIS?

08:10.761 --> 08:13.223
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE HIM OUT--
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH.
I CAN DO THIS.

08:13.223 --> 08:15.726
(Miranda) NO, NO, NO, SIR.
LET US MOVE YOU.
NO, MR. CORSO--

08:15.726 --> 08:17.728
COME ON. COME ON.
IT'S ONLY TWO STEPS.

08:17.728 --> 08:21.501
OH, MY--
IT'S EITHER THAT OR YOU GOTTA
GREASE ME UP LIKE A STUCK PIG,

08:21.501 --> 08:25.175
AND NOBODY WANTS THAT JOB.
HE HASN'T WALKED IN A YEAR.
BOBBY--

08:25.175 --> 08:27.878
OH, OKAY. (panting)
(Richard) OKAY. EASY, EASY.

08:27.878 --> 08:29.980
COME ON, SIR.
OKAY.

08:29.980 --> 08:31.982
(laughs)

08:31.982 --> 08:33.984
I DIDN'T THINK
I COULD DO THIS.

08:33.984 --> 08:37.087
OH, MY GOD.
BABY, YOU'RE STANDING!

08:37.087 --> 08:39.590
(laughs) YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS REMINDS ME OF?

08:39.590 --> 08:40.721
HUH?

08:40.721 --> 08:43.594
OUR WEDDING.

08:43.594 --> 08:44.895
(crack)
AAH!

08:44.895 --> 08:46.827
AAH!
(thud)

08:46.827 --> 08:48.929
(Melissa) AAH!
AAH!

08:48.929 --> 08:51.131
OH! UH...
(Bobby groans)

09:00.040 --> 09:02.112
UM,
BIMALLEOLAR ANKLE FRACTURES.

09:02.112 --> 09:06.116
TO WEAK TO SUPPORT HIS WEIGHT.
HE CAN GO TO C.T. NOW.
HE'S NOT
GOING IN THAT C.T.

09:06.116 --> 09:09.920
LOOK, I THINK IF WE CAN
POSITION HIM, WE COULD--
IT'S RATED FOR HALF HIS WEIGHT.
IF IT BREAKS,

09:09.920 --> 09:11.982
HE GETS HURT AGAIN,
AND IT'S NOT AVAILABLE

09:11.982 --> 09:14.785
FOR THE 50 OTHER PATIENTS
WHO NEED IT TODAY.
(Charles) OH,
WHAT ABOUT THE ZOO?

09:14.785 --> 09:18.088
THEY GOTTA HAVE A C.T.
FOR, LIKE, RHINOS, RIGHT?
PERCY, YOU'RE OFF THE CASE.
GOOD-BYE.

09:18.088 --> 09:20.761
NO, THAT WASN'T A JOKE.
THAT WAS AN ACTUAL SUGGESTION.
GO.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.193
(elevator bell dings)
IT'S A PRETTY GOOD IDEA,
ACTUALLY.

09:23.193 --> 09:24.895
IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.

09:24.895 --> 09:26.667
(Richard)
WE WILL SPARE THIS MAN

09:26.667 --> 09:29.569
THE INDIGNITY OF TREATING HIM
LIKE A ZOO ANIMAL.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.842
IF WE CAN'T GET AN IMAGE,
THEN WE'LL GO

09:31.842 --> 09:34.845
WITH CLINICAL LABS
AND TESTS.
I COULD DO A NUCLEAR
STRESS TEST ON HIS HEART.

09:34.845 --> 09:38.649
I JUST WISH THAT I COULD
GET HIM ON A TREADMILL.
(chuckles) WELL,
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

09:38.649 --> 09:42.152
ALL RIGHT. I HAVE A LAWYER
WAITING FOR ME. I HAVE TO GO.

09:42.152 --> 09:44.314
BUT I WANT TO HAVE
A MEETING WITH ALL OF YOU

09:44.314 --> 09:46.116
WHEN HIS STUDIES COME BACK

09:46.116 --> 09:48.859
BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER
DOWN THIS ROAD, OKAY?
LET'S WORK HIM UP.

09:48.859 --> 09:50.160
(Owen) MM-HMM.

09:50.160 --> 09:53.824
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

09:53.824 --> 09:56.096
UH, SO JUST
A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.868
UM, HIS DIABETES,

09:57.868 --> 10:01.101
DID HE HAVE IT BEFORE
HE--HE WAS IM-IMMOBILIZED?

10:01.101 --> 10:04.234
NO, THAT'S SINCE
HE PUT ON THE WEIGHT.
AND THAT'S BEEN, UM...

10:04.234 --> 10:06.877
HOW LONG HAS--HAS--

10:06.877 --> 10:09.339
HOW LONG
HAS HE BEEN LIKE THIS?
YEAH.

10:09.339 --> 10:12.983
UH, 5 YEARS AGO, HIS COMPANY
LAID OFF 300 EMPLOYEES.

10:12.983 --> 10:14.985
HE TRIED TO FIND WORK
FOR TWO YEARS.

10:14.985 --> 10:17.117
NO ONE WAS HIRING.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.819
AND THEN HE STOPPED TRYING.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.821
IT WAS REAL HARD ON HIM,
AND FOOD--

10:20.821 --> 10:22.823
WELL, FOOD MADE HIM
FEEL BETTER, SO...

10:22.823 --> 10:24.995
I THINK HE'S BEEN IN PAIN
FOR A WHILE.

10:24.995 --> 10:28.098
HE'D TELL ME IT'S INDIGESTION,
BUT I-I COULDN'T IGNORE IT.

10:28.098 --> 10:31.161
(chuckles) AFTER THE NEWS,
I JUST HAD TO CALL.

10:31.161 --> 10:32.663
THE NEWS?

10:32.663 --> 10:35.135
WELL, WE'RE--WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A BABY. I'M PREGNANT.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.636
(laughs) HOW?

10:36.636 --> 10:40.040
UH... (stammers) UM...

10:40.040 --> 10:42.142
I MEAN, WOW.
CONGRATULATIONS.

10:42.142 --> 10:46.316
THAT IS--THAT'S--
THAT'S JOYOUS NEWS.

10:46.316 --> 10:49.119
(mouths words)
(sighs)

10:49.119 --> 10:50.650
(clears throat)

10:50.650 --> 10:52.823
MM.

10:55.726 --> 10:58.028
(elevator bell dings)

10:58.028 --> 10:59.329
HEY.
HEY.

10:59.329 --> 11:01.091
YOUR DEPOSITION'S TODAY.

11:01.091 --> 11:03.093
YEAH. HEY, LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

11:03.093 --> 11:05.395
TEDDY AND OWEN--
CAN THEY WORK TOGETHER?
UH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:05.395 --> 11:07.097
NOTHING.
I WAS JUST SURPRISED

11:07.097 --> 11:09.399
THAT HE DIDN'T GO TO BAT
FOR HER GETTING THE JOB.

11:09.399 --> 11:11.371
IT WAS LIKE
HE WANTED HER TO GO.
UH, REALLY?

11:11.371 --> 11:14.074
YEAH, I GOTTA GO.
I... GOOD LUCK.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.777
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:16.777 --> 11:18.909
UM, BOBBY CORSO'S LABS.

11:18.909 --> 11:20.911
YOU'RE STILL ON
FATTY FATTY 2x4?

11:20.911 --> 11:22.753
OH, NO FAIR.
UM, NAME-CALLING.

11:22.753 --> 11:25.215
WHO'S THIS?
OH, MY PATIENT'S KID. SOCIAL
WORKER WON'T RETURN MY PAGE.

11:25.215 --> 11:28.118
WELL, THAT'S NOT
VERY SOCIAL.
UH, WHERE'S CALLIE?

11:28.118 --> 11:31.191
SHE'S BEEN WHINING
FOR A KID.
CRISTINA.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.193
WHAT?

11:33.193 --> 11:36.226
UM... EH, NEVER MIND.

11:36.226 --> 11:40.170
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

11:40.170 --> 11:43.073
THEY HAVE NO CASE.
GARY CLARK IS GRIEVING.

11:43.073 --> 11:45.075
YOU CAN DO ME
ONE FAVOR IN THERE.

11:45.075 --> 11:47.377
TRY NOT TO REFER TO HER
AS "MRS. CLARK" OR "SHE."

11:47.377 --> 11:50.080
DON'T USE PRONOUNS.
JUST STICK TO "THE PATIENT."

11:50.080 --> 11:51.812
IT KEEPS IT
LESS EMOTIONAL.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.314
OKAY.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.288
SO WHY IS HE HERE?

11:58.288 --> 11:59.449
SORRY?

11:59.449 --> 12:01.221
GARY CLARK.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.094
HE SHOULDN'T BE HERE FOR THIS.
HE DOESN'T NEED TO HEAR THIS.

12:04.094 --> 12:06.426
HE'S THE PLAINTIFF.
IT'S HIS PREROGATIVE.

12:06.426 --> 12:09.199
DON'T LET IT BOTHER YOU.
I'M MORE WORRIED
IT'S GONNA BOTHER HIM.

12:09.199 --> 12:12.803
(pager beeps)
SORRY. I HAVE TO GO.

12:15.135 --> 12:18.068
HEY. IS THE MEETING
WITH SHEPHERD

12:18.068 --> 12:19.369
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM?

12:19.369 --> 12:21.371
MM-HMM.

12:23.874 --> 12:25.876
THANK YOU.

12:25.876 --> 12:28.278
MY CONTRACT CAME IN,
AND...

12:28.278 --> 12:31.281
CRISTINA TOLD ME THAT YOU
PUT IN A GOOD WORD, SO...

12:31.281 --> 12:33.123
THANKS.

12:33.123 --> 12:35.125
OF COURSE.

12:43.193 --> 12:44.795
WHAT?

12:44.795 --> 12:47.097
NOTHING.

12:51.201 --> 12:53.503
(Derek) WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT?
(Mark) PATIENT'S GOT

12:53.503 --> 12:55.906
A SEVERE DEEP TISSUE INFECTION
UNDER HIS BELLY.

12:55.906 --> 12:57.177
THERE'S
A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ABSCESS.

12:57.177 --> 13:00.050
HUNT AND I NEED TO
GET IN THERE AND DEBRIDE,

13:00.050 --> 13:02.252
CLEAR OUT THE INFECTED FAT.
THAT MUCH SUDDEN FAT LOSS
IS DANGEROUS.

13:02.252 --> 13:04.284
IT'S PREFERABLE TO HIM
DYING OF AN INFECTION.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.087
BUT IT'S A RISKY SURGERY,
YES.
(Mark) BUT WE'LL HAVE BAILEY
AND WEBBER ON STANDBY

13:07.087 --> 13:09.159
IN CASE HE GOES SOUTH.
WHAT IS
THE SURGICAL RISK CALCULATION

13:09.159 --> 13:11.862
ON A PATIENT LIKE THIS?
ALMOST TOO HIGH TO CALCULATE.

13:11.862 --> 13:13.393
FIVE TIMES THE RISK
OF HEART ATTACK,

13:13.393 --> 13:16.396
RESPIRATORY FAILURE,
AIRWAY COMPLICATIONS.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.969
(Owen) HE'S DIABETIC, SO THERE'S
A RISK OF KETOACIDOTIC COMA.

13:18.969 --> 13:21.801
HIGH RISK
OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM.
(Richard)
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

13:21.801 --> 13:24.134
HE'S MALNOURISHED,
WHICH LEADS TO SLOW HEALING,

13:24.134 --> 13:25.936
RENAL FAILURE--
(Mark) NERVE DAMAGE...

13:25.936 --> 13:28.879
POST-OP INFECTION.
I'M SAYING NO.
THE RISK IS TOO HIGH.

13:28.879 --> 13:31.441
THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
BUT THAT'S IT.
SO YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE GONNA
SEND HIM AWAY TO DIE?

13:31.441 --> 13:33.443
I'M SAYING WE SEND HIM
TO A BARIATRIC CENTER

13:33.443 --> 13:35.445
THAT'S PREPARED FOR
A TYPE OF PATIENT LIKE THIS

13:35.445 --> 13:37.447
INSTEAD OF US SPENDING
OUR TIME AND RESOURCES

13:37.447 --> 13:40.450
CARING FOR SOMEONE WHO OBVIOUSLY
DOES NOT CARE FOR HIMSELF.

13:40.450 --> 13:42.822
(scoffs)

13:58.909 --> 14:00.270
DEREK, HE'S ME,

14:00.270 --> 14:02.272
JUST SWAP OUT
THE BOOZE FOR THE FOOD.

14:02.272 --> 14:04.274
YOU DON'T THINK
I CARE ABOUT MYSELF?

14:04.274 --> 14:07.117
HE HAS AN ILLNESS
THAT HE CANNOT CONTROL.

14:07.117 --> 14:09.119
HE NEEDS HELP.
I'M SORRY. I...

14:09.119 --> 14:11.121
THAT WASN'T YOU IN THERE.

14:11.121 --> 14:13.123
AND THAT WASN'T ABOUT
BOBBY CORSO.

14:13.123 --> 14:14.985
IT WAS ABOUT GARY CLARK.

14:14.985 --> 14:17.157
YOU ARE SEEING
POTENTIAL LAWSUITS

14:17.157 --> 14:19.159
WHERE YOU
USED TO SEE PATIENTS.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.861
IT'S THE JOB, DEREK. THE JOB
CAN CHANGE YOUR PRIORITIES.
EXCUSE ME. SHEPHERD?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.633
DEREK, DON'T LET IT.

14:23.633 --> 14:27.167
TELL SLOAN TO GO AHEAD,
OPEN HIM UP.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.069
YES, HUNT.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.601
THAT CONVERSATION WE HAD
ABOUT ALTMAN,

14:31.601 --> 14:33.603
DID YOU SHARE THAT
WITH ANYONE?

14:33.603 --> 14:35.305
I--

14:35.305 --> 14:37.307
DID YOU SHARE THAT
WITH YOUR WIFE?

14:37.307 --> 14:41.051
DID MEREDITH SAY SOMETHING?
WHEN I MAKE

14:41.051 --> 14:43.053
A PROFESSIONAL RECOMMENDATION
ABOUT A FELLOW ATTENDING,

14:43.053 --> 14:45.015
I EXPECT IT
TO BE KEPT IN CONFIDENCE.

14:45.015 --> 14:48.018
I DO NOT EXPECT TO HEAR ABOUT IT
FROM ONE OF MY RESIDENTS.

14:48.018 --> 14:50.460
I THOUGHT
I COULD ASSUME THAT MUCH.
(exhales deeply)

14:50.460 --> 14:52.192
HOW'S YOUR DAY GOING?

14:55.065 --> 14:56.466
(Callie) DR. GREY.

14:56.466 --> 14:59.169
UH, YEAH. UH, JAMIE, WE ARE
GOING TO OPEN UP YOUR KNEE,

14:59.169 --> 15:02.202
AND WE'RE GONNA WIRE
ALL THE PIECES OF YOUR PATELLA

15:02.202 --> 15:04.234
BACK TOGETHER.
ARE YOU GONNA DO
THE OPERATION?

15:04.234 --> 15:06.937
YEP.
YOU'LL HOLD MY HAND
THROUGH THE WHOLE THING?

15:06.937 --> 15:09.279
(laughs) I THINK IT'S BETTER
IF I'M HOLDING THE SCALPEL.

15:09.279 --> 15:11.411
BUT I CAN HOLD YOUR HAND
RIGHT NOW.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.043
FINE.

15:13.043 --> 15:15.145
(laughs) OKAY.

15:15.145 --> 15:17.147
DO YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

15:17.147 --> 15:19.289
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING,
BUT, UH, I DON'T WANT

15:19.289 --> 15:21.251
THE HAND-HOLDING PART
TO END.
(chuckles)

15:21.251 --> 15:23.593
SO... CAN WE SIT HERE
A MINUTE?

15:23.593 --> 15:25.295
(laughs) YOU ARE SO BAD.

15:25.295 --> 15:27.257
(chuckles)
I WILL SEE YOU IN THE O.R.

15:27.257 --> 15:29.599
(laughs)

15:29.599 --> 15:31.431
(clears throat)

15:31.431 --> 15:33.563
(indistinct conversations)

15:33.563 --> 15:36.206
WOW. SHOULD WE HAVE
LEFT YOU TWO ALONE?

15:36.206 --> 15:37.337
WHAT?

15:37.337 --> 15:40.110
GETTING A LITTLE STEAMY
IN THERE.

15:40.110 --> 15:43.113
(laughs) OH, GIVE ME A BREAK.
I'M IN A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP.

15:43.113 --> 15:45.245
THAT WAS CHITCHAT.
YEAH, THERE WAS STEAM.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.247
IT WAS STEAMY CHITCHAT.
WITH HAND-HOLDING.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.249
YEAH, PHYSICAL CONTACT'S
AN IMPORTANT PART

15:49.249 --> 15:51.351
OF ESTABLISHING
A PATIENT'S TRUST.

15:51.351 --> 15:54.284
BAILEY DID PATIENT SENSITIVITY
THIS MORNING.

15:54.284 --> 15:58.158
DID SHE TEACH YOU NOTHING?
SO THERE WAS NO FLIRTING GOING
ON. I WAS JUST IMAGINING THAT.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.290
YEAH, SURE. SHE WAS KINDA
FLIRTY, AND I WAS FLIRTY BACK

16:00.290 --> 16:02.532
BECAUSE I'M TRYING
TO PUT HER AT EASE.

16:02.532 --> 16:05.295
TALKING TO THE PATIENT THE WAY
THE PATIENT TALKS TO YOU

16:05.295 --> 16:08.538
MAKES 'EM FEEL UNDERSTOOD
AND SAFE AND...

16:08.538 --> 16:11.341
YOU'RE MORONS.

16:11.341 --> 16:13.073
(elevator bell dings)

16:13.073 --> 16:16.346
OH, AND A LITTLE PERVY.
JEEZ.

16:16.346 --> 16:18.248
(chuckles)

16:18.248 --> 16:20.510
(woman) ♪ BE MY THRILL ♪

16:20.510 --> 16:21.681
(dings)

16:21.681 --> 16:23.353
PUT ME DOWN FOR 715.

16:23.353 --> 16:25.055
GOT IT.

16:25.055 --> 16:26.356
WHAT HAPPENS AT 7:15?

16:26.356 --> 16:28.058
715 IS HER BET.

16:28.058 --> 16:30.360
I'M MAKING A POOL
ON BOBBY CORSO'S ACTUAL WEIGHT.

16:30.360 --> 16:33.023
20 BUCKS, CLOSEST WITHOUT
GOING OVER WINS THE POT.

16:33.023 --> 16:34.324
YOU WANT IN?

16:34.324 --> 16:36.496
HOW ARE YOU
STILL ON THAT CASE?

16:36.496 --> 16:39.499
ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION.
IT HAD TO BE.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.502
WAIT. WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT?
BOBBY CORSO.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.705
HOW DID THEY MAKE A BABY?
(Cristina) HE HASN'T LEFT
THE HOUSE IN FIVE YEARS.

16:45.705 --> 16:48.308
IT TOOK A TRUCK TO GET HIM HERE.
HOW IS HE SUPPOSED TO GO

16:48.308 --> 16:51.211
TO A FERTILITY CLINIC
TO FILL UP A CUP?
HOW DOES HE FIND IT
TO FILL UP A CUP?

16:51.211 --> 16:54.314
(laughs)
YOU KNOW, THEY CAN STILL
DO IT THE REGULAR WAY.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.546
RIGHT?
HAVE YOU SEEN THE GUY MOVE?

16:56.546 --> 16:58.648
'CAUSE HE CAN'T, REALLY,
AT ALL.

16:58.648 --> 17:01.591
WELL, MAYBE HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.
MAYBE SHE DOES ALL THE WORK.

17:01.591 --> 17:03.293
BUT HOW? I MEAN--

17:03.293 --> 17:05.625
I'M FINISHED.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.598
OH, UM...

17:08.598 --> 17:10.400
GET YOURSELF SOME ICE CREAM.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.533
BUT I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO HAVE THAT MUCH SUGAR.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.106
(laughs)
WELL, GET
SOME ROAST BEEF THEN.

17:16.106 --> 17:17.567
(Meredith chuckles)
SHE CAN SIT.

17:17.567 --> 17:20.470
NO, SHE CAN'T.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT S-E-X.

17:20.470 --> 17:23.543
I'M 9,
AND YOU JUST SPELLED "SEX."

17:23.543 --> 17:25.545
(laughs) THAT'S GOOD.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.617
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S SAY...

17:27.617 --> 17:30.420
THIS IS THE WIFE.
NO. DON'T DO THAT.

17:30.420 --> 17:33.253
AND THIS IS... HIM.
(Lexie and Meredith laugh)

17:33.253 --> 17:36.256
GUESS I WON'T
BE EATING THAT NOW.
OKAY, WELL,
SHE'S GOTTA BE ON TOP.

17:36.256 --> 17:39.359
SHE MIGHT GET
ALTITUDE SICKNESS. (laughs)
(laughs)

17:39.359 --> 17:41.291
(Meredith laughs)
GUYS. (clears throat)

17:41.291 --> 17:42.762
(all stop laughing)

17:42.762 --> 17:44.394
(cash register dings)

17:44.394 --> 17:46.196
(Cristina) UH, S-SORRY.
UM...

17:46.196 --> 17:48.138

17:48.138 --> 17:50.140
YOU'RE--YOU'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

17:50.140 --> 17:52.472
HOW MY HUSBAND AND I MANAGED
TO GET A BABY IN HERE.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.174
THERE ARE
SOME LOGISTICS INVOLVED.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.446
YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU?

17:56.446 --> 17:58.708

HOW ABOUT YOU TELL ME

ANY FAVORITE POSITIONS?

18:04.384 --> 18:05.685
OR KINKS--

18:05.685 --> 18:07.687
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT,
BECAUSE I KNOW

18:07.687 --> 18:11.261
YOU ALL MUST HAVE A FREAK SHOW
OF YOUR OWN GOING ON.

18:11.261 --> 18:13.463

18:15.325 --> 18:18.268

18:18.268 --> 18:20.400
OKAY.

18:20.400 --> 18:25.335

18:39.689 --> 18:42.392
HAS--HAS DIED,

18:42.392 --> 18:45.395
AND THE INFECTION
IS EATING THROUGH YOUR SKIN.

18:45.395 --> 18:48.398
WELL, I SUPPOSE
IT HAD TO COME TO THAT.

18:48.398 --> 18:50.160
I'VE EATEN EVERYTHING ELSE.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.162
THE OPERATION
IS EXTREMELY RISKY.

18:52.162 --> 18:54.634
YOU HAVE
A HIGHER THAN NORMAL CHANCE

18:54.634 --> 18:58.308
THAT A SURGICAL COMPLICATION

19:06.376 --> 19:08.378
(Richard) MR. CORSO,

19:08.378 --> 19:10.250
YOU WANT THE SURGERY.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.721
YOU WANT TO TRY--

19:11.721 --> 19:14.924
I'VE TRIED...

19:14.924 --> 19:17.387
EVERYTHING.

19:17.387 --> 19:20.230
HIGH PROTEIN,
THE LOW CARBS,

19:20.230 --> 19:23.233
DRUGS, PILLS, HYPNOSIS--

19:23.233 --> 19:25.595
I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING.

19:25.595 --> 19:28.598
YOU HAVE A BABY ON THE WAY.
THINK ABOUT THAT.

19:28.598 --> 19:32.372
WHO DO YOU THINK
I'M THINKING ABOUT?

19:32.372 --> 19:34.374
YOU...

19:34.374 --> 19:37.176
YOU DREAM OF HAVING A KID.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.580
YOU PICTURE YOURSELF
PLAYING BALL WITH HIM.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.913
YOU PICTURE HER
STANDING ON YOUR FEET...

19:43.913 --> 19:46.586
WHILE YOU DANCE AROUND
WITH HER, YOU KNOW?

19:46.586 --> 19:49.759
YOU DON'T PICTURE THEM
BRINGING YOU FOOD AND...

19:49.759 --> 19:51.921
CLEANING YOU UP.

19:53.923 --> 19:58.298
I CAN'T WALK FOUR STEPS
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.800
YOU TELL ME...

20:00.800 --> 20:03.273
WHO DESERVES THAT GUY
AS A FATHER?

20:03.273 --> 20:06.336
NO...

20:06.336 --> 20:08.238
I JUST...

20:08.238 --> 20:12.312
WANT TO BE GONE BEFORE THE KID
HAS A CHANCE TO KNOW WHO I AM.

20:12.312 --> 20:15.615
DON'T TELL MY WIFE
ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

20:15.615 --> 20:20.420
LET'S JUST TELL HER
IT'S TOO RISKY.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.422
LET ME GO HOME.

20:27.357 --> 20:30.400
OH, HEY, PEANUT.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.263
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:38.308 --> 20:40.310
CAN WE SEE MY MOM NOW?

20:40.310 --> 20:42.512
I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT.
IS SHE GONNA BE OKAY?

20:42.512 --> 20:44.514
YOU WANT AN HONEST ANSWER?
YES.

20:44.514 --> 20:46.015
I DON'T KNOW.

20:46.015 --> 20:48.348
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING?

20:52.322 --> 20:53.623
I HEAR THAT YOU'RE SCARED.

20:53.623 --> 20:56.926
IT'S SCARY, UH, WHEN YOUR MOM
OR DAD GETS HURT

20:56.926 --> 20:58.558
AND YOU FEEL ALONE.

20:58.558 --> 21:01.361
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

21:02.792 --> 21:04.794
'CAUSE WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

21:04.794 --> 21:07.297
MY DAD AND I
WERE IN A CAR ACCIDENT,

21:07.297 --> 21:09.799
AND HE WAS HURT,
AND I WAS REALLY SCARED.

21:09.799 --> 21:12.842
SO I KNOW.

21:12.842 --> 21:14.844
WAS YOUR DAD OKAY?

21:16.946 --> 21:18.608
YEP. HE WAS FINE.

21:18.608 --> 21:20.850
NOW LET'S GO
SEE ABOUT YOUR MOM.

21:20.850 --> 21:23.413
(man) COMING THROUGH!
OH... HEY,
GET BACK, GET BACK.

21:23.413 --> 21:24.914
WHAT, UH, WHAT HAPPENED?

21:24.914 --> 21:26.916
ECHO SHOWS
A VENTRICULAR WALL RUPTURE.

21:26.916 --> 21:29.018
O.R. TWO IS READY.
THEY'RE WAITING.

21:29.018 --> 21:30.720
(Teddy) YANG, ARE YOU COMING?
YEAH.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.862
UM, UH, WHAT ABOUT THE KID?
I'LL TAKE HER.

21:32.862 --> 21:34.394
MOMMY?

21:34.394 --> 21:36.826
MOMMY!

21:36.826 --> 21:38.928
UM, UH, DO YOU NEED ME?

21:38.928 --> 21:40.900
WHAT?
YOU HAVE AVERY.
DO YOU NEED ME?

21:40.900 --> 21:43.072
YANG, IN OR OUT,
LET'S GO.
UM...

21:43.072 --> 21:44.474
(pants)

21:44.474 --> 21:45.875
YANG.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.612
(exhales)

22:02.091 --> 22:05.555
YOU WANTED ME TO SIGN
DISCHARGE PAPERS?

22:09.499 --> 22:11.701
MRS. CORSO, I...

22:11.701 --> 22:14.103
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE THING
IN THE--THE CAFETERIA.

22:14.103 --> 22:16.105
IT'S EASY TO MAKE JOKES
ABOUT HIM.

22:16.105 --> 22:18.938
YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM BEFORE.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.340
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
INSIDE ALL THAT

22:21.340 --> 22:24.414
IS THE SAME MAN
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN,

22:24.414 --> 22:27.517
WHO CAN MAKE ME LAUGH
TILL I CAN'T BREATHE.

22:27.517 --> 22:30.520
HE'S BEEN TRYING TO MAKE
YOU GUYS LAUGH ALL DAY,

22:30.520 --> 22:33.483
BUT YOU'RE TOO DISGUSTED
TO EVEN SMILE

22:33.483 --> 22:35.655
OR JOKE WITH HIM...

22:35.655 --> 22:38.488
MAKE HIM FEEL LIKE A PERSON.

22:38.488 --> 22:42.992
I BROUGHT HIM HERE BECAUSE
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD HELP HIM.

22:42.992 --> 22:46.796
(voice breaking) BUT YOU'RE ONLY
MAKING HIM FEEL WORSE.

22:46.796 --> 22:49.098
SO UNLESS YOU WANT TO
TELL ME THE NEXT STEP

22:49.098 --> 22:51.100
TO GETTING HIM OUTTA HERE
AND HOME,

22:51.100 --> 22:53.673
I DON'T NEED TO HEAR
ANYTHING FROM YOU.

26:05.294 --> 26:07.296
THE PATIENT HAD

IN HER EYES?

26:12.942 --> 26:14.944
THERE WAS
A PUPILLARY RESPONSE.

26:17.246 --> 26:18.978
ABSENCE OF

MINIMAL BRAIN ACTIVITY.

26:26.055 --> 26:27.917
NOW I'M SORRY.

26:27.917 --> 26:30.890
I TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO YOU
THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO--
SO SHE WAS ALIVE

26:30.890 --> 26:33.592
UNTIL YOU WITHDREW CARE,
UNTIL YOU PULLED THE PLUG?

26:33.592 --> 26:35.594
I'M SORRY.
I'M NOT BEING CLEAR.

26:35.594 --> 26:40.069
UM... ACCORDING TO THE LETTER
OF HER ADVANCED DIRECTIVE,

26:40.069 --> 26:43.633
THERE WAS
A LEVEL OF BRAIN ACTIVITY

26:43.633 --> 26:45.705
THAT I JUDGED TO BE--
YOU JUDGED?

26:45.705 --> 26:47.336
IT--
YOU DECIDED?

26:47.336 --> 26:50.209
IT WAS MY OPINION TO...

26:50.209 --> 26:51.781
SHOULD WE STOP NOW?

26:51.781 --> 26:54.644
(Lauren) YES, I'M GONNA SUGGEST
THAT WE TAKE A BREAK,

26:54.644 --> 26:56.646
GET OURSELVES TOGETHER,
RESUME LATER ON.

26:56.646 --> 26:59.989
DOES THAT SOUND ALL RIGHT?
(man) FINE.

27:04.023 --> 27:06.856
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU
THEY DON'T HAVE A CASE?
YES.

27:06.856 --> 27:08.357
WITH RESPECT, DR. SHEPHERD,

27:08.357 --> 27:10.359
PLEASE STOP TRYING
TO GIVE THEM ONE.

27:10.359 --> 27:12.631
DO NOT APOLOGIZE.

27:15.204 --> 27:17.306
OKAY.

27:19.909 --> 27:21.911
(Mark)
THE INFECTION'S REALLY DEEP.

27:21.911 --> 27:24.914
UNDERNEATH ALL THIS FAT
IS JUST--
MORE FAT.

27:24.914 --> 27:26.916
YEP.
I'M DOWN
TO THE ABDOMINAL WALL.

27:26.916 --> 27:29.048
(Richard) HOW'S THE FASCIA?
NOT TOO GOOD.

27:29.048 --> 27:31.751
WANT TO TAKE
A LOOK INSIDE?

27:31.751 --> 27:34.183
IT'S PROBABLY
A CAN OF WORMS,

27:34.183 --> 27:37.086
BUT... YEAH.

27:37.086 --> 27:42.131
LET'S HAVE
A... LITTLE PEEK.

27:44.063 --> 27:47.236
AH, DAMN IT.
GONNA HAVE TO GO IN.

27:47.236 --> 27:50.439
BAILEY, WEBBER, SCRUB IN...
FAST.

27:50.439 --> 27:52.071
OKAY.

27:52.071 --> 27:55.444
(monitor beeping erratically)

28:07.186 --> 28:09.358
SO THERE'S A HOLE
IN THE WALL?

28:09.358 --> 28:11.761
RIGHT, AND THE BLOOD
IS SUPPOSED TO GO

28:11.761 --> 28:13.763
FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER,
EXCEPT IT'S JUST...

28:13.763 --> 28:15.694
RUSHING OUTSIDE
THROUGH THE HOLE.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.696
AND IT CAN'T GET
TO HER BRAIN?

28:17.696 --> 28:19.268
GOT IT.

28:19.268 --> 28:21.971
YES. OR TO HER LUNGS.

28:21.971 --> 28:24.303
SO THEY'RE GOING TO
SEW UP THE HOLE.

28:24.303 --> 28:28.337
THEY'LL TRY TO,
BUT THE HEART HAS TO BE STRONG,

28:28.337 --> 28:32.041
LIKE, UM, LIKE NYLON,
LIKE YOUR SHOES.

28:32.041 --> 28:33.312
(cards clatter)

28:33.312 --> 28:37.186
YOUR MOM'S HEART IS WEAK,
LIKE PAPER.

28:37.186 --> 28:40.719
(cards shuffle)

28:40.719 --> 28:43.823
WHAT HAPPENS IF SHE DIES?

28:45.855 --> 28:48.357
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT
IF THAT HAPPENS.

28:48.357 --> 28:51.260
GOTCHA. MINE.

28:55.264 --> 28:57.937
(shuffles cards)

29:05.244 --> 29:08.477
IF YOUR MOM DIES...

29:08.477 --> 29:11.220
YOU'LL FEEL
A LOT OF THINGS.

29:11.220 --> 29:13.422
(card flicks)

29:13.422 --> 29:15.424
FIRST YOU'LL FEEL LIKE, UH,

29:15.424 --> 29:17.426
YOU COULDA DONE MORE
TO HELP HER,

29:17.426 --> 29:20.960
BUT... THAT'S NOT TRUE.
