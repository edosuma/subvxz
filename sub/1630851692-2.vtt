WEBVTT

00:01.301 --> 00:02.801
[Chantel] Now it's here,
and I'm finally graduating.

00:02.803 --> 00:04.303
[Pedro speaking]

00:04.305 --> 00:08.340
[Karen speaking]

00:08.342 --> 00:11.610
[River] Chantel is the first
person in my family...

00:11.612 --> 00:13.645
[River speaking]

00:13.647 --> 00:15.381
She's gonna be so mad.

00:16.449 --> 00:20.219
[Nicole in Spanish]

00:25.325 --> 00:27.559
[in Spanish]

00:27.561 --> 00:29.228
[in Spanish]

00:30.296 --> 00:32.331
[in Spanish]

00:32.333 --> 00:34.433
[in Spanish]

00:38.905 --> 00:40.172
[in Spanish]

00:40.174 --> 00:42.775
[Nicole in Spanish]

00:44.511 --> 00:47.046
[in Spanish]

00:48.248 --> 00:50.883
[Karen] After we got back
from the Philippines,

00:50.885 --> 00:53.118
Winter just moved back in
with Jah.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.453
[Chantel] Do you think
that Winter

00:54.455 --> 00:56.221
is gonna bring Jah to my party?

00:56.223 --> 00:57.956
[Karen] We'll just have
to play it by ear.

00:57.958 --> 00:59.425
[Winter]
<i>This is the first time</i>

00:59.427 --> 01:01.427
<i>that my family has seen Jah</i>

01:01.429 --> 01:03.328
since the big blowup.

01:03.330 --> 01:05.531
[Karen] Jah,
I know you have a son

01:05.533 --> 01:07.599
and I know Winter doesn't know.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.535
[Jah] Winter.

01:09.537 --> 01:12.171
[Winter] Like,
I just don't understand.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.505
- [speaking Spanish]
- [speaking Spanish]

01:13.507 --> 01:15.641
Winter should be here shortly.

01:19.212 --> 01:21.113
[Jah speaking]

01:21.115 --> 01:25.050
[Chantel] When Winter
walks in with Jah, I'm like...

01:25.052 --> 01:26.685
[Pedro speaking]

01:40.100 --> 01:42.067
Well, congratulations.

01:42.069 --> 01:44.203
Whoever she loves, I love.

01:45.071 --> 01:46.905
You did it.
You got through it.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.407
You stuck with it.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.375
- And here we are today...
- [Chantel] Yeah.

01:50.377 --> 01:51.710
you know, so...

01:57.817 --> 01:59.485
[River] Hold on.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.653
There is a big elephant
in the room, you know?

02:02.722 --> 02:03.922
[Chantel] That's right.
I agree.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.224
You can't just walk in here
and pretend

02:05.226 --> 02:06.558
like it's like all good 'cause
it's like, you know...

02:06.560 --> 02:08.494
Now, I'd like to get...
I'd like to get to something.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.631
<i>[Jah] I think they enjoy
putting me in the hot seat</i>

02:12.633 --> 02:14.399
<i>and interrogating me.</i>

02:14.401 --> 02:17.269
I just remember, you know,
what happened last time.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.004
The disrespect.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.939
[Karen] Jah, I wish you
had told Winter

02:20.941 --> 02:23.709
about your son a long time ago.

02:26.646 --> 02:27.813
- Come on.
- Stop.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.414
- Just...
- [Karen] Jah.

02:29.416 --> 02:31.917
[Jah] You can control her
but you can't control me.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.252
- Excuse me.
- [Karen] Jah, we need some answers.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.920
[Jah] Let me get by.
Excuse me.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.255
[Karen] How come you
didn't tell us?

02:36.257 --> 02:38.957
[Jah] No, I don't wanna talk
to you about anything.

02:38.959 --> 02:42.327
[Jah speaking]

02:42.329 --> 02:44.963
But I'm making an effort
to show Winter

02:44.965 --> 02:46.398
that this is what I want.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.066
<i>I want a future with Winter.</i>

02:48.068 --> 02:49.568
And I'm willing to, you know,

02:49.570 --> 02:51.537
even be around her family

02:51.539 --> 02:53.105
if that's what it takes.

02:54.941 --> 02:57.276
You kind of robbed each other
like to know like

02:57.278 --> 02:58.810
your whole story at the jump.

02:59.612 --> 03:01.613
You told her half the story.

03:03.049 --> 03:04.550
Did you not think Winter
was strong enough

03:04.552 --> 03:06.151
to handle that at that time?

03:08.087 --> 03:10.289
[Winter] Me and Jah,
we've already

03:10.291 --> 03:12.491
had these conversations
in private.

03:12.493 --> 03:13.992
I would have wanted to know

03:13.994 --> 03:16.628
and you guys already know that.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.797
-[Chantel] So what do you feel now?
-You know, I love Jah.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.766
I love Liani, you know?

03:20.768 --> 03:22.668
And I just didn't know
what to do.

03:24.003 --> 03:25.504
Like, I... At the beginning,

03:25.506 --> 03:27.072
I really wasn't able
to forgive Jah.

03:27.074 --> 03:28.440
I was beyond hurt.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.008
I felt betrayed.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.577
I felt betrayed by you guys too

03:31.579 --> 03:33.011
'cause I wish I would have known

03:33.013 --> 03:34.246
that you guys were going there.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.518
<i>[River] Who's at fault?</i>

03:39.520 --> 03:42.654
- Who's in the wrong?
- Everyone is at fault.

03:45.992 --> 03:47.426
Everyone, okay?

03:47.428 --> 03:49.061
<i>My sister and my mother,</i>

03:49.063 --> 03:50.562
they could have asked me

03:50.564 --> 03:51.863
or they could have talked to Jah

03:51.865 --> 03:53.465
simply if they wanted to know.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.566
- Jah should have...
- Would you have let...

03:54.568 --> 03:56.468
- But would you have let them?
- I would've let them.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.303
Jah should have told me
straight up

03:58.305 --> 04:00.072
from the beginning.
Everyone is at fault.

04:00.074 --> 04:03.108
There's a lot of just
moving variables.

04:03.110 --> 04:05.611
<i>-[River] I mean...
-[Winter] It was a messy situation.</i>

04:05.613 --> 04:07.546
It was a really messy situation,

04:07.548 --> 04:09.514
but at the same time...

04:16.189 --> 04:19.291
You should have told her
from the beginning.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.095
[Jah] I wish y'all would have
just like asked me

04:23.097 --> 04:24.496
'cause that was like
some sneaky...

04:24.498 --> 04:26.498
[Karen] Jah. Yeah,
it was sneaky,

04:26.500 --> 04:28.300
but, Jah, you were sneaky too.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.302
Sneaky peeky, tipping around.

04:30.304 --> 04:31.403
You were sneaky.

04:31.405 --> 04:33.038
How would I know what to ask?

04:33.040 --> 04:34.640
I thought this was a graduation,

04:34.642 --> 04:36.608
- not an interrogation.
- [Karen] It is, Jah, but I just...

04:36.610 --> 04:38.110
I know it's just my opportunity

04:38.112 --> 04:39.945
'cause I don't see you
that often

04:39.947 --> 04:41.947
- and this is my big chance...
- Okay. But, listen, you...

04:41.949 --> 04:43.515
- to talk to you as...
- But, listen, so this is what you're saying.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.651
You're saying you don't
see him too often...

04:45.653 --> 04:47.786
- I don't.
- but you're interrogating him,

04:47.788 --> 04:50.355
- making him not feel like he wants to see you.
- Right.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.794
<i>[Chantel] For Jah
to think that he's going</i>

04:55.796 --> 04:58.430
<i>to come and sit
at this table with us</i>

04:58.432 --> 05:03.235
and not be expected
to account for his lies,

05:03.870 --> 05:05.504
that's [bleep].

05:08.341 --> 05:09.775
- Yeah.
- I feel like right now,

05:09.777 --> 05:12.644
this is like not the environment

05:12.646 --> 05:14.413
where it should even be,

05:14.415 --> 05:16.882
you know, discussed. I mean,

05:16.884 --> 05:18.250
this is kind of like

05:18.252 --> 05:20.285
we arriving from the graduation.

05:20.287 --> 05:21.553
- At times, it was like extortion...
- [Chantel] Right.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.988
I feel like...
I would like nothing more

05:22.990 --> 05:25.490
than to understand why

05:25.492 --> 05:28.193
you kept this from her
for so long.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.395
You met Winter.

05:30.397 --> 05:32.531
You introduced her
to your daughter.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.232
- You introduce her to your son.
- Well, that's... You know,

05:34.234 --> 05:35.801
I'm saying it's my relationship.

05:35.803 --> 05:39.538
It's my decision, you know?

05:39.540 --> 05:41.606
[Chantel]
The main thing is that

05:41.608 --> 05:43.141
you should have told her

05:43.143 --> 05:44.276
- from the beginning.
- [Jah] I was.

05:44.278 --> 05:45.577
Y'all robbed me of my chance

05:45.579 --> 05:47.212
- to tell her.
- [Chantel] From the beginning.

05:48.548 --> 05:49.981
No?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.618
[Karen] I'm glad I spread all
my bull [bleep] repellent

05:53.620 --> 05:57.589
before I came out here
because I did not rob Jah

05:57.591 --> 06:00.125
of his opportunity
to tell Winter.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.661
He robbed himself
of the opportunity

06:02.663 --> 06:04.162
when he neglected to tell

06:04.164 --> 06:07.366
he had two kids six years ago.

06:07.368 --> 06:09.167
[Thomas] He was probably
gonna wait 14 years.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.402
He probably was.

06:12.105 --> 06:15.340
I felt like it was...
it was very nasty

06:15.342 --> 06:18.543
how you... how you guys
went about it.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.912
How would you feel like,
you know what I'm saying,

06:20.914 --> 06:22.347
you got a sister, you know,

06:22.349 --> 06:24.282
and then the guy
she's dealing with

06:24.284 --> 06:26.885
has another kid that
she didn't know about.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.720
How would you look
at the situation?

06:32.225 --> 06:34.226
Listen, if you intend
to be a part of our family,

06:34.228 --> 06:36.128
listen, this is... this is it.

06:36.130 --> 06:38.230
Come on now.
Love us or leave us.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.564
This is it.

06:43.469 --> 06:46.204
I have joint custody of my son

06:46.206 --> 06:48.673
and I've been going through
a lot of legal battles

06:48.675 --> 06:51.076
to just see my son
and be in his life,

06:51.078 --> 06:53.078
so I just felt like all of that

06:53.080 --> 06:55.046
was overbearing, you know?

06:55.048 --> 06:57.783
She was already, you know,
taking care of Liani.

06:57.785 --> 07:01.753
So I didn't want to have
too much on her plate.

07:02.822 --> 07:04.623
Y'all kind of set me up.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.225
Y'all was out creeping around

07:07.227 --> 07:10.862
looking through, you know,
unnecessary things.

07:10.864 --> 07:13.098
You know, I was gonna
already tell her.

07:18.037 --> 07:20.439
[Chantel] Jah only says that
he was gonna tell Winter

07:20.441 --> 07:21.706
- about his son...
- Mmm-hmm.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.341
because he was caught...

07:23.343 --> 07:24.643
Yeah. He was caught.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.144
in a lie.

07:29.081 --> 07:32.784
You had my sister
crying her eyes out. How...

07:32.786 --> 07:34.686
[Jah] Y'all had her crying
her eyes out too though.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.788
[Chantel] ...am I supposed
to feel comfortable

07:36.790 --> 07:38.557
with her living with you

07:38.559 --> 07:40.425
that you're not gonna pull

07:40.427 --> 07:42.093
something like this again?

07:50.937 --> 07:53.104
My hope is that you both

07:53.106 --> 07:55.006
get into some kind of
counseling.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.208
I don't know if
I need counseling.

07:56.210 --> 07:57.442
- I don't think so.
- [Karen] I think you need it.

07:57.444 --> 07:58.577
I think you guys need it.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.011
[Jah] She knows now

08:00.013 --> 08:01.913
and we're trying
to move forward.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.482
I'm coming here tonight

08:03.484 --> 08:05.417
to show support for her
and for...

08:05.419 --> 08:06.418
You know?

08:08.321 --> 08:10.255
I don't believe Jah when he says

08:10.257 --> 08:12.257
that he's trying to come
around more.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.392
<i>[Karen] He will have
to prove himself</i>

08:14.394 --> 08:16.795
not only to Winter but to us.

08:16.797 --> 08:19.030
How could he possibly
prove himself to us

08:19.032 --> 08:20.532
after seven years?

08:20.534 --> 08:22.467
- It's up to him.
- I feel like I already know

08:22.469 --> 08:27.105
he's not somebody
who I want for my sister.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.174
- Get some counseling.
- [Karen] Get some counseling.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.209
[chuckles]
I think you need it.

08:35.047 --> 08:36.948
[Thomas] Well,
I would like to say

08:36.950 --> 08:39.651
that the benjo burgers
and the beef burgers,

08:39.653 --> 08:40.986
they're ready.

08:45.658 --> 08:49.694

10:26.526 --> 10:30.362
I myself don't have any
surgeries on my body.

10:30.364 --> 10:31.997
[Pedro speaking]

10:31.999 --> 10:32.897
But...

10:41.308 --> 10:42.774
[Pedro makes sound]

10:42.776 --> 10:44.442
I think your sister...
As a nurse,

10:44.444 --> 10:46.311
I feel like your sister
is gonna be just fine

10:46.313 --> 10:49.981
as long as she follows
the doctor's orders

10:49.983 --> 10:52.250
and makes sure that her doctor
really know what he's doing.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.151
Yeah.

So last night,
it was so beautiful.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.889
Mmm-hmm. It really was.

18:44.891 --> 18:48.426
But, I mean, I didn't know
that you were gonna bring Jah.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.995

it was a good time

18:50.997 --> 18:52.497
to bring him to help celebrate.

18:52.499 --> 18:55.266
Why would you think that?

18:55.268 --> 18:57.468
I don't feel

18:57.470 --> 19:01.072
very easy about the way

19:01.074 --> 19:03.608
<i>Jah was responding
to our questions,</i>

19:03.610 --> 19:06.210
and I don't want for her to just

19:06.212 --> 19:09.413
be so naive as she
has been in the past

19:09.415 --> 19:12.049
and take Jah's word
for everything.

19:12.051 --> 19:14.986
[Winter] We have to start
mending somehow.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.087
[Chantel] He doesn't have
a relationship with me

19:16.089 --> 19:18.022
or anybody else.

19:18.024 --> 19:21.626
Well, that's what we're
trying to fix.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.795
<i>Chantel, she was
very hard on Jah last night,</i>

19:24.797 --> 19:27.932
and I thought that she
would be able to understand

19:27.934 --> 19:30.902
a little bit more given
the situation between her

19:30.904 --> 19:34.138
and Pedro and what happened.
I mean, she lied to us,

19:34.140 --> 19:38.142
<i>didn't tell us that she was
actually engaged to Pedro.</i>

19:38.144 --> 19:39.544
And so I would think
that she would be able

19:39.546 --> 19:41.979
to understand like
the fears of not

19:41.981 --> 19:44.615
coming forward with something,
you know?

19:44.617 --> 19:47.952
I should have brought that up.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.921
I love Jah.

19:49.923 --> 19:53.591
I mean, I would like
to get married to Jah.

19:56.562 --> 20:01.599
He should have proposed to you
like maybe the second year.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.334
[Winter] Well, I mean
he asked me but I said no

20:03.336 --> 20:04.969
'cause when I met him
I was like what,

20:04.971 --> 20:07.171
19, 18 years old?

20:07.173 --> 20:09.073
You never told me that.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.711
Well, yeah, that's happened
before but I said no

20:13.713 --> 20:17.215
- 'cause I didn't what to.
- Did he get you a ring?

20:17.217 --> 20:20.451
He did but I said no.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.354
[Chantel] Oh.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.989
<i>[Winter] No relationship
is perfect.</i>

20:24.991 --> 20:26.824
Mmm-hmm.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.993
And I'm not claiming that
my relationship is perfect,

20:28.995 --> 20:32.096
but I am saying that I'm happy.

20:32.098 --> 20:35.600
So constantly being reminded
of past mistakes

20:35.602 --> 20:38.202
and past hiccups
is definitely not the move,

20:38.204 --> 20:40.104
and that's not helping me.

20:41.406 --> 20:45.243
[Chantel] My intuition
is validated because

20:45.245 --> 20:49.413
he proposed to you before
he told you he had a son,

20:49.415 --> 20:52.717
so he could have never told you.

20:52.719 --> 20:55.319
He could be lying
that he was about to tell you.

20:55.321 --> 20:58.022
I mean,

20:58.024 --> 21:00.891
I know that you wanna marry
him but it took me

21:00.893 --> 21:04.028

to find out that he had a son

21:04.030 --> 21:08.399
before he even acknowledged it
and told you.

21:10.636 --> 21:15.239
When you say I do,
it's for better or worse.

21:15.241 --> 21:18.309
And if it's not already
good now,

21:18.311 --> 21:20.177
how is it gonna be better?

21:21.446 --> 21:24.649
Winter takes too much
of a backseat to her issues

21:24.651 --> 21:29.820

let's a lot of things slide.

26:13.940 --> 26:16.473
Thank you so much
for joining me today.

26:16.475 --> 26:18.876
My name is Rebecca Ammazi.

26:18.878 --> 26:21.946
I am an Atlanta

There are four bedrooms

I do believe that Pedro
and Chantel are gonna

26:33.826 --> 26:35.492
be able to find what they want.

26:35.494 --> 26:37.861

to be honest.

I hate the bathroom.

26:52.777 --> 26:55.679
So far, the houses
in my price range,

26:55.681 --> 26:57.481
I don't like any of them.

26:57.483 --> 27:00.784
[Pedro speaking]

27:03.121 --> 27:06.056

I can see that guy's hammock.

- [Chantel] ...we can get a crate for them,

go to New York if Alejandro

28:33.813 --> 28:35.145
and Nicole work out,

28:35.147 --> 28:38.382
so I'm not really considering

28:38.384 --> 28:42.186
that in my purchase of my home.

28:42.188 --> 28:45.322
[Pedro speaking]

28:47.459 --> 28:49.693
But think about how much money
it's gonna cost for us

to put all that work
into this basement, amore.

28:52.431 --> 28:55.532
[Pedro speaking]

28:57.135 --> 28:59.169
Are you gonna take a second job?

29:01.439 --> 29:04.108
I think that you're just being
a little hasty because

29:04.110 --> 29:06.810
you see the possibilities
in this basement.

29:08.646 --> 29:11.014
Think about it logically, amore.

29:52.123 --> 29:53.791
Yeah, but I just kind of wanted

29:53.793 --> 29:56.193
to see something that was
like, oh, not so ugly.

29:56.195 --> 29:57.995

30:07.006 --> 30:07.871
[Chantel] Yeah.

30:07.873 --> 30:10.340
[Pedro speaking]

30:10.342 --> 30:12.309
I told you don't let it expire.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.412
[Pedro speaking]

30:22.520 --> 30:23.987
[Chantel] Pedro, you didn't know

30:23.989 --> 30:25.255
that you couldn't fly back

30:25.257 --> 30:27.424
to the DR without your passport.

30:27.426 --> 30:31.528
You said, "I'm from the DR.
They're going to let me in."

30:31.530 --> 30:33.297
- I don't say that.
- Baby, yes, you did.

30:33.299 --> 30:35.165
I said, "Pedro, you need
to renew your passport..."

30:35.167 --> 30:36.667
- [Pedro speaking]
- "...because you

30:36.669 --> 30:38.101
won't be able
to go back to the DR."

30:38.103 --> 30:39.903
[Pedro speaking]

30:39.905 --> 30:42.339
And you say, "I Dominican.
I can go back to the DR."

30:42.341 --> 30:44.842
[Pedro speaking]

30:44.844 --> 30:46.543
- Yeah, you did.
- [Pedro speaking]

30:46.545 --> 30:48.879
- We had that conversation.

30:48.881 --> 30:50.414
[Chantel] You...
We were playing...

30:50.416 --> 30:54.017
We were watching TV,
you said, "I Dominican."

30:54.019 --> 30:58.021
And then I said, "Pedro,
the airline won't let you

30:58.023 --> 31:00.791
on the plane
to get to the DR."

31:00.793 --> 31:04.528
You said, "Oh. Oh, yeah.
That's right."

31:08.366 --> 31:10.234
Yeah, it does.

it's the right thing to do

to start a relationship
