00:36.640 --> 00:40.179
(The Lady in Dignity)

00:42.750 --> 00:46.890
I am building a second house in Gwacheon,

00:46.990 --> 00:49.750
so I want to change the art and paintings into something fresh.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.789
This is my home.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.960
You should know what style I prefer.

00:55.130 --> 00:58.429
Since this is your second house, I suggest a cozy atmosphere.

00:59.859 --> 01:00.899
For example,

01:00.899 --> 01:03.770
we can make this wall a plastered wall with a watercolor painting,

01:03.799 --> 01:05.640
and we can hang an oil painting here.

01:08.340 --> 01:12.739
I heard that you not only do house styling consultation,

01:12.739 --> 01:15.709
but also personal styling consultation.

01:21.250 --> 01:23.760
You are pretty famous in this line of work...

01:23.760 --> 01:27.060
since Ms. Morinake is a person who gives adequate reviews...

01:27.060 --> 01:28.760
to things she's impressed in.

01:28.790 --> 01:31.659
You are also liked among the women in Gangnam.

01:31.700 --> 01:35.170
I want you to make a bag for me. A clutch and a Boston bag.

01:35.530 --> 01:38.670
Okay. I know your style better than anyone else.

01:38.670 --> 01:41.640
I will design a one-and-only handbag...

01:41.640 --> 01:43.980
with your name, Seo Jin Kyung on it.

01:45.379 --> 01:47.409
A one-and-only handbag?

01:47.480 --> 01:49.579
Yes. You can count on it.

01:49.810 --> 01:50.980
Okay.

01:51.980 --> 01:54.250
When did you prepare all that?

01:55.519 --> 01:59.319
Right. Clothes, bags and shoes.

01:59.319 --> 02:01.260
You made them yourself, didn't you?

02:02.730 --> 02:05.730
By the way, is your father-in-law awake yet?

02:08.330 --> 02:09.500
Father.

02:12.939 --> 02:14.169
Park Bok Ja.

02:15.110 --> 02:17.240
Where is she now?

02:22.009 --> 02:26.719
Get her for me. Does she know that I passed out?

02:27.219 --> 02:28.419
Yes.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.289
But I don't think she's coming.

02:31.289 --> 02:33.259
I need an explanation.

02:33.830 --> 02:35.430
Please get her for me.

02:35.460 --> 02:36.699
Father.

02:37.759 --> 02:40.000
I divorced Jae Seok.

02:41.330 --> 02:45.099
I'm not in the position to meddle in your business.

02:45.199 --> 02:49.210
I have no one else to trust but you.

02:52.310 --> 02:54.610
I wanted to believe that her love was true.

02:55.080 --> 02:58.550
So, I gave all my shares to her.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.750
I thought...

03:01.150 --> 03:03.250
maybe she really liked me.

03:10.229 --> 03:13.300
I'm not going to wake up.

03:14.330 --> 03:18.569
Let's keep this as a secret between us.

03:24.740 --> 03:26.639
I'm sorry about Jae Seok.

03:27.379 --> 03:29.650
I didn't raise him right.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.750
Is your father-in-law awake?

03:35.889 --> 03:38.360
No. He's not awake yet.

03:39.090 --> 03:42.629
I see. Well, I guess it's no longer your business...

03:42.629 --> 03:43.960
since you're divorced.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.199
Hello, Hyo Ju.

03:54.009 --> 03:55.210
The hospital?

03:56.469 --> 03:57.840
Gi Ok.

03:59.710 --> 04:01.610
I am embarrassed.

04:01.879 --> 04:04.050
If a person is exposed to the world,

04:04.349 --> 04:06.419
who wouldn't be embarrassed?

04:11.689 --> 04:13.090
Gi Ok, are you okay?

04:13.930 --> 04:15.389
You must have been busy.

04:15.590 --> 04:16.930
Why did you come?

04:18.100 --> 04:19.399
- You're here. - Yes.

04:19.660 --> 04:20.930
Are you okay?

04:20.930 --> 04:22.769
Let's just talk about you today.

04:23.970 --> 04:25.970
Gi Ok, just lie down for a while.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.970
Okay. I'll lie down. You two have fun.

04:30.540 --> 04:32.040
Don't leave me though.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.350
I am very lonely.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.819
I checked that yesterday. Thank you, Hyo Ju.

04:43.959 --> 04:47.629
No problem. I will keep on advertising,

04:47.629 --> 04:49.790
so keep uploading the art,

04:49.790 --> 04:51.600
consulting pictures, and designing products.

04:51.600 --> 04:56.230
No. Just advertise bags and shoes on your blog.

04:56.230 --> 04:58.439
I think we should be focusing on a target.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.569
I am planning to launch my own brand.

05:02.769 --> 05:04.480
Do you want...

05:05.339 --> 05:07.350
a separate category just for yourself?

05:07.449 --> 05:08.810
Can you do that for me?

05:09.209 --> 05:11.350
If you can, I would be very thankful.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.949
I will give you sufficient commissions from the profits.

05:15.519 --> 05:17.259
You're great, A Jin.

05:17.790 --> 05:20.759
Ji Hu once told me...

05:21.829 --> 05:24.100
that the clouds may hide the sun,

05:24.329 --> 05:26.160
but the sun is always shining.

05:27.800 --> 05:31.500
It seems that the clouds are very thick.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.740
What are you going to do about your husband?

05:38.980 --> 05:40.350
I am divorced.

05:44.350 --> 05:46.050
I'm going to accept marriage and divorce...

05:46.750 --> 05:49.389
as a part of life's process.

05:51.459 --> 05:54.089
It made me think...

05:55.389 --> 05:56.959
about my life and myself.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.720
Are you okay?

06:21.790 --> 06:24.019
You're here. Come and sit.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.470
How dare you come here.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.470
I came to apologize.

06:37.670 --> 06:39.670
What? Apologize?

06:41.709 --> 06:45.009
Sorry for seducing your husband.

06:52.250 --> 06:54.089
I didn't know it would come to this.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.620
Please forgive me.

07:02.829 --> 07:04.000
I'm sorry.

07:16.339 --> 07:18.810
Is this brunch group about to be revived?

07:23.449 --> 07:25.250
I'd say this is...

07:25.350 --> 07:28.949
like a friendly gathering at the DMZ.

07:30.589 --> 07:34.259
Gyeong Hui and I will always be enemies.

07:38.029 --> 07:39.430
Be careful.

07:40.670 --> 07:42.629
The early stages of pregnancy is the most dangerous.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.170
No.

07:45.170 --> 07:46.339
What do you mean?

07:46.470 --> 07:50.139
Neither my husband nor Dr. Jang is the father.

08:03.519 --> 08:05.060
This is unbelievable.

08:06.089 --> 08:10.199
How can a caregiver mess up the whole family?

08:10.329 --> 08:11.959
It's all Jae Seok's fault.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.800
He cheated on A Jin,

08:14.800 --> 08:17.100
making her care less about family business.

08:17.439 --> 08:21.269
Honestly, she used to take care of all family matters.

08:21.370 --> 08:24.879
Was Ju Mi so useless?

08:24.879 --> 08:26.310
Ju Mi was nothing to Bok Ja.

08:26.379 --> 08:28.480
She ignored Ju Mi,

08:29.149 --> 08:31.720
but she listened to A Jin.

08:35.919 --> 08:38.519
Jae Gu. Let's get our company back!

08:39.289 --> 08:40.889
Let's get it back!

08:41.659 --> 08:42.960
My goodness.

08:43.799 --> 08:46.129
Do you want your company back?

08:48.830 --> 08:50.470
(Han Min Gi, CEO of MK Capital)

08:59.879 --> 09:01.750
How can you eat in this situation?

09:03.149 --> 09:04.350
Let's break up.

09:04.549 --> 09:07.990
I lost all my love for you in the court.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.590
Hey!

09:13.090 --> 09:14.259
Gosh.

09:14.629 --> 09:16.759
You shouldn't disturb someone who's eating.

09:17.730 --> 09:19.059
Make up for my ruined life.

09:19.500 --> 09:22.429
My life has been ruined after I met you.

09:22.429 --> 09:25.370
You're the one to talk! It's my life that has been ruined.

09:25.370 --> 09:26.840
You seduced me.

09:26.840 --> 09:29.210
How can you seduce me when you're married?

09:29.210 --> 09:32.139
I can't believe this. You're the one who seduced me.

09:32.139 --> 09:35.409
I divorced my wife because of you.

09:35.409 --> 09:38.320
Because of you, I got my pictures taken away...

09:38.320 --> 09:39.779
and people know about what I did.

09:40.690 --> 09:42.519
I haven't been this much humiliated in my life.

09:42.620 --> 09:45.320
Because of you, I lost my job,

09:45.320 --> 09:48.230
and I ended up like this.

09:48.230 --> 09:51.799
Because of you, I am done, screwed and destroyed.

09:51.799 --> 09:53.330
Because of you,

09:54.429 --> 09:56.669
I am neglected by everyone.

10:00.470 --> 10:03.409
I need a settlement. Give this house to me and we'll call it even.

10:03.409 --> 10:05.139
Then, I'll leave you be.

10:08.850 --> 10:11.720
Where is the other page? Give it to me.

10:13.590 --> 10:14.889
Aren't you going to give it?

10:18.789 --> 10:21.759
Hey! Didn't I tell you to stop this?

10:21.830 --> 10:23.960
Why should I listen to you?

10:23.960 --> 10:25.460
Why?

10:26.429 --> 10:27.870
I was out of my mind...

10:28.000 --> 10:30.240
to abandon my flower, A Jin,

10:30.269 --> 10:31.740
for someone stupid like you.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.610
- What? - I'm not giving you that document.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.210
Make up for my ruined life.

10:39.580 --> 10:41.210
Make up for it!

10:41.210 --> 10:42.850
You make up for my ruined life.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.450
Make up for my arm too. How dare you bite me?

10:47.049 --> 10:48.289
Get out of this house!

10:49.090 --> 10:50.590
I will never leave.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.220
Over my dead body!

10:52.220 --> 10:53.590
If you leave,

10:53.929 --> 10:55.659
A Jin will forgive me.

11:00.330 --> 11:01.529
Did you just...

11:02.000 --> 11:03.639
hit me?

11:03.639 --> 11:05.440
You bit me.

11:05.500 --> 11:08.110
Did you just hit me?

11:08.639 --> 11:11.779
- Did you just do that? - I'm going to get tetanus.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.149
I should hurry to the hospital.

11:15.980 --> 11:19.179
Love is but a dream. It's like a dirty towel.

11:59.059 --> 12:01.029
Did you say that you know my mother?

12:06.600 --> 12:08.100
35 years ago,

12:09.299 --> 12:11.840
a poor married couple who used to be tenants in this place...

12:12.970 --> 12:15.409
adopted a girl.

12:15.509 --> 12:18.379
She scratched my daughter's face and it will leave a scar.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.850
She stole this doll too!

12:21.009 --> 12:22.350
Sorry, ma'am.

12:22.909 --> 12:26.789
Why did you adopt such a brat? Send her back to the orphanage!

12:27.549 --> 12:31.419
Because she clawed at the landlord's daughter,

12:32.289 --> 12:35.659
she was sent back to the orphanage.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.129
The girl who was sent back...

12:40.269 --> 12:41.429
is me.

12:43.029 --> 12:45.700
Then, that doll...

12:46.500 --> 12:47.740
Yes.

12:48.340 --> 12:49.809
That doll...

12:50.240 --> 12:53.139
You accused me of stealing it.

12:57.879 --> 12:59.179
Don't worry.

12:59.620 --> 13:01.789
I'm not here to argue about that.

13:06.789 --> 13:08.090
I want you...

13:09.460 --> 13:10.799
to sell this house to me.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.970
Mom lost her consciousness because of a stroke.

13:17.970 --> 13:21.610
I got divorced ten years ago and I live with my family now.

13:22.139 --> 13:23.340
But this house...

13:24.210 --> 13:26.850
is about to be auctioned.

13:27.080 --> 13:30.950
I was going to get my revenge by buying that house,

13:31.379 --> 13:34.120
but how unlucky!

13:34.620 --> 13:35.919
This is disappointing.

13:37.620 --> 13:38.889
Where should I take you?

13:44.759 --> 13:46.299
Welcome!

13:51.139 --> 13:53.970
Give me this one, this one, this one,

13:54.509 --> 13:55.710
and this one.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.840
Just give me everything in this store.

14:35.509 --> 14:37.350
Be careful. Come on.

14:37.350 --> 14:38.649
Sorry.

14:40.450 --> 14:41.649
Stop it.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.620
You're out. You over there!

14:45.120 --> 14:46.490
I can't believe this.

14:49.759 --> 14:51.960
This one is hard to wear and take off.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.970
That one! Give that to me.

15:01.009 --> 15:03.309
How is this...

15:03.639 --> 15:07.110
Give me everything here.

15:09.350 --> 15:10.679
Move.

15:23.629 --> 15:25.460
That will be 19,800 dollars.

15:27.429 --> 15:29.600
I will deliver these...

15:29.600 --> 15:31.840
to your St. Palace Suite tomorrow morning.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.509
Okay. Get something to eat with the change.

15:35.610 --> 15:39.139
- She must be a nouveau riche. - She obviously lacks elegance.

15:51.659 --> 15:52.889
Goodness.

15:53.460 --> 15:55.460
It was Jae Hui, right?

15:56.830 --> 15:59.659
You and your siblings don't stand a chance against Park Bok Ja .

16:00.100 --> 16:02.269
- What did you say? - It's a different story...

16:02.470 --> 16:03.940
if someone helps.

16:05.669 --> 16:07.470
You should help us, Mr. Han.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.039
Please let us reclaim our company.

16:09.039 --> 16:11.309
Our goal is to sell the company back.

16:11.309 --> 16:13.980
We can sell Daesung Pulp for 80 million dollars.

16:14.009 --> 16:17.919
Taking the value of the assets and sales into account,

16:18.049 --> 16:21.789
it seems likely that 80 million can be recovered within 5 years.

16:22.519 --> 16:24.659
There's an investment bank that we do business with.

16:24.659 --> 16:27.190
Paying 10 million for the contract, 10 million for the first payment,

16:27.190 --> 16:29.960
and having the rest financed through initial public offering...

16:29.960 --> 16:33.259
are the ways to save your company.

16:34.529 --> 16:35.769
To put it simply,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.399
borrow 10 million dollars using the real estate...

16:38.399 --> 16:41.639
and the account receivables as collateral,

16:41.639 --> 16:44.110
finance the rest by investments, and then acquire the company.

16:44.879 --> 16:47.210
Where do I attract investments?

16:47.210 --> 16:49.049
I can do it for you.

16:49.850 --> 16:51.549
Just prepare the 10 million dollars.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.419
How do you expect me to prepare 10 million dollars?

16:54.419 --> 16:56.649
You can use Chairman Ahn's cash or real estate property...

16:56.649 --> 16:59.590
as a collateral and take a loan out from a bank.

17:00.789 --> 17:03.799
But why are you reinvesting in a company...

17:03.799 --> 17:07.130
that you have already bought to help us?

17:12.269 --> 17:16.210
My nickname in this industry is Hyena.

17:17.140 --> 17:19.339
But I have a critical weakness.

17:20.009 --> 17:23.210
I become weak-willed when I see a woman I'm attracted to.

17:24.779 --> 17:26.118
With nothing in return...

17:28.049 --> 17:29.619
From the moment I saw you,

17:30.119 --> 17:31.589
I wanted to help.

17:50.380 --> 17:51.609
Darn it.

17:59.950 --> 18:01.150
Hello?

18:01.220 --> 18:02.819
A Jin, it's me.

18:09.829 --> 18:12.130
- Ma'am. - How have you been?

18:12.299 --> 18:14.329
Why didn't you let yourself in...

18:14.430 --> 18:15.670
Is Ju Mi inside?

18:26.039 --> 18:28.480
So, I am the lady in charge of this house, right?

18:28.680 --> 18:32.519
You got divorced and the wench fled.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.619
That means I should be in charge.

18:37.819 --> 18:39.220
Where is the bank account?

18:39.660 --> 18:42.990
Where is the bank account of this house?

18:43.559 --> 18:44.960
Go upstairs.

18:47.369 --> 18:48.630
Did you eat yet?

18:48.970 --> 18:49.970
A Jin.

18:51.599 --> 18:53.369
What do I do with Un Gyu now?

18:54.509 --> 18:56.539
How can Father do this?

18:57.910 --> 19:01.609
Why did he give all his money to that wench?

19:02.950 --> 19:04.680
All of this is your fault!

19:05.579 --> 19:08.049
Why did you let her in this house?

19:08.450 --> 19:11.420
How can you leave without taking responsibility?

19:12.519 --> 19:16.490
A Jin. We should catch her and take back our money.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.299
Think about Ji Hu.

19:18.559 --> 19:19.799
She sold the company...

19:19.859 --> 19:21.700
and took all the money.

19:22.430 --> 19:23.799
Can you bear with that?

19:25.140 --> 19:28.140
Those assets weren't mine anyway.

19:28.140 --> 19:30.609
- What? - Those belonged to Father.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.109
I will manage by myself.

19:32.210 --> 19:35.880
I will raise Ji Hu myself and take responsibility...

19:36.079 --> 19:37.349
for my actions.

19:37.349 --> 19:39.849
Stop trying to act sophisticated!

19:40.319 --> 19:41.990
What a loser.

19:41.990 --> 19:45.220
But I will make her come back.

19:45.460 --> 19:47.930
Since I started this, I'll end it.

19:48.890 --> 19:51.460
So, hang in there.

19:51.460 --> 19:53.400
You can't be weak like this.

19:54.069 --> 19:55.329
It's over.

19:56.839 --> 20:00.410
There is a reason why I had to bear with this.

20:01.269 --> 20:03.269
Father passed out, so he's at the hospital.

20:03.269 --> 20:04.380
You should go and see him.

20:05.140 --> 20:07.509
That crazy old man. Why should I go there?

20:07.509 --> 20:08.849
What has he done for me?

20:10.349 --> 20:13.250
This is why Father gave all your assets to that woman.

20:14.549 --> 20:15.920
Maybe he knew...

20:16.720 --> 20:19.190
that this would happen.

20:19.890 --> 20:22.589
He probably thought that he would be better off giving his assets...

20:22.930 --> 20:25.059
to that woman rather than giving it to his children.

20:25.059 --> 20:27.599
That's why he is crazy!

20:29.099 --> 20:30.500
It's his choice.

20:31.039 --> 20:32.769
It's our fault.

20:35.269 --> 20:37.140
Are you in with her?

20:37.539 --> 20:38.940
Did both of you plot against us?

20:40.509 --> 20:41.809
I will never forgive...

20:42.349 --> 20:45.049
both Father and that wench...

20:46.519 --> 20:48.519
Tell him to just die!

20:49.089 --> 20:52.220
Just tell Mr. Chairman to die!

20:53.190 --> 20:54.789
Do you know...

20:55.789 --> 20:56.799
where she is?

21:03.670 --> 21:06.069
His pupillary reflex and electrocardiogram...

21:06.269 --> 21:07.470
show that he's fine,

21:07.710 --> 21:09.339
but why won't he wake up?

21:50.279 --> 21:52.720
Welcome. Did you make a reservation?

21:52.720 --> 21:54.650
- No. - Do you want consultation?

21:54.990 --> 21:56.890
Follow me to the consultation room.

21:57.220 --> 21:59.589
I want to consult with the head doctor right away.

22:00.130 --> 22:02.160
The procedure is to consult with me first,

22:02.160 --> 22:04.160
then you can meet the head doctor.

22:04.460 --> 22:07.000
The Gold Class Procedure here...

22:07.029 --> 22:09.269
A wealthy person I know...

22:09.269 --> 22:11.640
had an anti-aging treatment here priced at 150,000 dollars.

22:11.799 --> 22:13.670
I am interested in it.

22:13.670 --> 22:16.839
Okay. I will arrange a meeting with the head doctor right away.

22:16.839 --> 22:18.079
Please follow me.

22:23.420 --> 22:24.450
Hello.

22:25.119 --> 22:28.349
I heard that you are interested in the Gold Class Anti-Aging Procedure.

22:28.349 --> 22:31.259
Yes. How young would I look...

22:31.259 --> 22:33.319
and how fast?

22:34.230 --> 22:35.289
You are impatient.

22:35.589 --> 22:38.500
I will explain in detail about the procedure.

22:38.759 --> 22:39.759
If I may...

22:45.140 --> 22:48.170
First, we will transfer and rearrange the fat,

22:48.170 --> 22:50.309
then tighten the skin with a laser,

22:50.309 --> 22:53.450
give you 50 placenta shots and then 30 Cinderella shots.

22:53.450 --> 22:54.549
Also...

22:56.680 --> 22:59.079
You jerk! How dare you do this to me again.

22:59.720 --> 23:03.119
You treat your wife as a sandbag, you coward.

23:03.119 --> 23:05.089
Do you think you can mess around with me?

23:05.089 --> 23:06.160
Let go of me!

23:06.890 --> 23:09.789
Okay. I'll let go.

23:13.099 --> 23:14.099
Gosh.

23:14.099 --> 23:17.000
Don't get plastic surgery from him.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.410
This guy is a scumbag. He messed around with my wife.

23:20.869 --> 23:25.240
Call the police, you punk. Call the police.

23:26.039 --> 23:27.750
She went to the hospital for plastic surgery.

23:28.579 --> 23:29.579
Yes.

23:30.619 --> 23:33.119
Yes, sir.

23:43.289 --> 23:45.130
- Did you finish your business? - Go to the hotel.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.160
Yes.

23:47.829 --> 23:48.869
Gosh.

23:48.869 --> 23:53.200
The rich people in this country are total scums.

23:55.369 --> 23:57.180
How dull.

23:57.640 --> 23:58.940
My gosh.

24:04.019 --> 24:06.450
Your wife and the lawyer...

24:07.349 --> 24:09.150
looked pretty intimate.

24:09.950 --> 24:11.259
That's not true.

24:11.890 --> 24:13.660
You seem to wish it wasn't true,

24:13.730 --> 24:15.490
but the two are very close.

24:15.990 --> 24:20.869
He brought her home once in his arms when she was drunk.

24:22.329 --> 24:24.900
Nothing happened since I was there,

24:25.000 --> 24:26.470
but surely,

24:27.869 --> 24:31.309
something would have happened if I wasn't.

24:32.339 --> 24:36.349
Did he come inside the house?

24:37.380 --> 24:40.119
His eyes were full of affection.

24:45.319 --> 24:47.559
Come on. Why does she keep calling me?

24:49.660 --> 24:52.160
How do you expect to get back the company?

24:53.160 --> 24:54.700
Stop dreaming yourself.

24:55.700 --> 24:56.869
Goodness.

24:57.869 --> 24:59.970
What should I do with the punk?

25:04.809 --> 25:07.809
I am here to deliver the products Park Ji Yeong ordered to her suite.

25:08.210 --> 25:12.220
She's not here, but I got the notice. I'll show you the way.

25:43.750 --> 25:44.750
It's delicious today.

25:49.650 --> 25:50.920
What brings you here?

25:50.920 --> 25:53.460
Listen to me carefully. I will appeal!

25:53.660 --> 25:56.660
I cannot accept this divorce.

25:56.700 --> 25:58.599
I will take back my wife.

25:58.799 --> 26:01.000
This is not over until it's over.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.039
I won't divorce her. I will cancel this divorce.

26:04.140 --> 26:06.640
If you are going to appeal, hire a lawyer first.

26:06.869 --> 26:08.710
- Do you want me to recommend you? - Shut it!

26:09.069 --> 26:12.380
A lawyer that you recommend would be on your side, not mine!

26:13.380 --> 26:17.549
Hey. Stop flirting with my wife.

26:18.349 --> 26:19.380
Leave, please.

26:19.680 --> 26:23.019
Since you are appealing, I will prepare for my case too.

26:23.420 --> 26:26.059
I will protect her...

26:26.059 --> 26:30.599
from guys like you at all costs.

26:32.700 --> 26:33.730
Hey!

26:34.029 --> 26:37.539
A Jin has her own pride and emotions!

26:37.539 --> 26:39.640
You stay and leave as you please,

26:39.640 --> 26:42.039
and you live your life the way you want.

26:42.069 --> 26:43.480
You hurt her,

26:44.680 --> 26:46.240
and now, you want her back.

26:48.349 --> 26:52.279
I will protect her from you!

26:53.920 --> 26:56.690
Hey. What did you just say?

26:58.559 --> 27:01.289
I was right.

27:01.589 --> 27:03.160
You two are fooling around, right?

27:03.160 --> 27:06.000
Watch your words! Fooling around?

27:06.000 --> 27:08.269
- Sir. - Do you really...

27:09.529 --> 27:10.799
have feelings for my wife?

27:11.700 --> 27:12.799
Of course.

27:13.339 --> 27:16.240
How could a man not have feelings for a woman like her?

27:16.640 --> 27:18.910
I do like her very much.

27:19.579 --> 27:20.750
You scumbag!

27:21.980 --> 27:23.049
Do you...

27:25.950 --> 27:27.349
like her a lot?

27:28.089 --> 27:31.059
If you hurt her once more,

27:32.319 --> 27:33.930
you will die in my hands.

27:34.490 --> 27:35.660
Did you say appeal?

27:36.930 --> 27:38.430
Do as you wish.

27:38.529 --> 27:39.730
You little...

27:39.730 --> 27:41.500
Kill me!

27:41.500 --> 27:43.329
Kill me!

27:46.170 --> 27:47.609
Did you just hit me?

27:49.069 --> 27:51.210
Leave or I'll call the police.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.410
Police? Call the police.

27:53.480 --> 27:56.279
I should call the police since you hit me.

27:56.279 --> 27:57.750
Leave! Now!

28:06.059 --> 28:08.160
I want to ask you a favor.

28:08.589 --> 28:12.029
Please let A Jin and I get back together.

28:13.470 --> 28:15.670
Please, tall guy.

28:17.140 --> 28:20.710
Please...

28:34.420 --> 28:36.119
I'm planning to take a rest in the suite.

28:36.190 --> 28:39.119
So be here at the meeting with Mr. Han tomorrow morning.

28:39.119 --> 28:41.289
- I will escort you. - There's no need. Go.

29:13.829 --> 29:17.259
- She must be a nouveau riche. - She obviously lacks elegance.

29:48.730 --> 29:49.730
(Woo A Jin)

29:50.559 --> 29:54.369
I am heading to your hotel. We really need to meet.

29:59.569 --> 30:01.309
(Navigating to St. Palace)

30:01.309 --> 30:03.039
(Entrance, Parking Lot, Store, Restaurant)

30:15.750 --> 30:16.819
Hello?

30:17.019 --> 30:19.089
- Where are you? - None your business.

30:19.960 --> 30:20.990
A Jin.

30:21.259 --> 30:22.630
Let's get back together.

30:23.059 --> 30:25.799
It was my fault. I am officially asking you for forgiveness.

30:25.799 --> 30:27.200
Hang up. I'm busy.

30:27.329 --> 30:31.069
A Jin. Don't ever meet him!

30:31.569 --> 30:33.509
Can't you stop barking?

30:33.569 --> 30:36.109
What? Barking?

30:36.940 --> 30:40.609
I know you're saying such hurtful things to get over me.

30:41.250 --> 30:42.349
A Jin.

30:42.809 --> 30:45.579
You must be joking. We are divorced.

30:45.819 --> 30:48.720
If you keep insisting, I will ask for a restraining order.

30:48.750 --> 30:51.920
That guy hit me. I got hit.

30:52.119 --> 30:54.930
He's violent. He's very low quality.

30:56.160 --> 30:57.859
A Jin?

30:58.059 --> 31:00.599
Are you listening?

31:01.400 --> 31:05.000
A Jin!

31:29.859 --> 31:33.299
Destruction of property cases cannot be settled,

31:33.500 --> 31:34.869
so there will be a punishment.

31:34.900 --> 31:36.230
I will not settle.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.640
I won't either. It's his second time he did this to me.

31:41.039 --> 31:43.640
Then, is he the guy with the golf club before?

31:43.640 --> 31:45.339
It wasn't me, I swear!

31:45.339 --> 31:49.779
- If it wasn't you, who was it? - How dare you talk down to me!

31:52.480 --> 31:55.890
(Good deeds make a good place to live.)

32:07.299 --> 32:09.799
(The resident's been wreaking havoc on our residential environment.)

32:09.799 --> 32:12.640
"Good deeds make..."

32:12.640 --> 32:14.940
"a good place to..."

32:34.130 --> 32:36.859
Can you please tell Park Ji Yeong in the suite that I'm coming up.

32:36.859 --> 32:38.329
Sure. Wait a second.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.630
What's your name?

32:43.130 --> 32:44.200
Woo A Jin.

32:51.740 --> 32:54.380
What's the name of the person in the suite?

32:55.880 --> 32:57.349
It's Woo A Jin.

32:58.319 --> 32:59.380
Woo A Jin.

33:29.450 --> 33:31.519
Is this what you wanted?

33:37.059 --> 33:38.359
I am happy.

33:39.690 --> 33:44.130
Money is always so great.

33:44.630 --> 33:47.869
Your happiness won't last too long.

33:48.529 --> 33:51.400
Before you realize...

33:51.400 --> 33:55.069
that all you have wished for was nothing,

33:55.140 --> 33:56.710
you will fall into misfortune.

33:58.039 --> 33:59.039
Do you know why?

33:59.440 --> 34:02.380
It's because you know...

34:02.380 --> 34:05.819
what you did was wrong.

34:10.090 --> 34:12.260
You know...

34:12.960 --> 34:14.929
that you did something wrong, right?

34:19.630 --> 34:20.699
Woo A Jin.

34:21.300 --> 34:22.869
You got divorced, didn't you?

34:23.539 --> 34:27.809
You shouldn't talk like that when you insist on living in a house...

34:27.809 --> 34:29.570
that belongs to the woman...

34:30.079 --> 34:32.880
who took your husband.

34:34.980 --> 34:38.518
I only insist on taking what is mine.

34:39.119 --> 34:41.449
I have rights to that property.

34:42.289 --> 34:44.960
When I successfully placed Daesung Pulp products into a supermarket,

34:44.960 --> 34:49.230
Mr. Chairman gave me a performance fee.

34:49.230 --> 34:50.599
I used it to buy the property.

34:50.599 --> 34:52.199
That's where I draw the line.

34:52.530 --> 34:54.800
I only desire what is mine.

34:55.900 --> 34:58.070
That's the difference between us.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.110
If you wish for things that aren't yours,

35:01.369 --> 35:03.539
it will only end in destruction.

35:04.039 --> 35:05.079
Destruction?

35:06.710 --> 35:08.579
I will never end up in destruction.

35:08.909 --> 35:12.780
Money makes you king.

35:14.250 --> 35:15.320
Actually,

35:16.150 --> 35:20.360
I have enough money to make you kneel before me.

35:20.489 --> 35:23.960
No. I will never kneel before you.

35:24.530 --> 35:26.829
I found something much more valuable than money.

35:28.599 --> 35:30.239
Make everything go back to the way it was.

35:30.239 --> 35:31.239
I don't want to.

35:31.570 --> 35:32.670
Why should I?

35:33.139 --> 35:35.840
He gave you his shares with his impaired decision-making ability...

35:35.840 --> 35:37.710
caused by Alzheimer's disease.

35:39.840 --> 35:40.880
Alzheimer's disease?

35:42.980 --> 35:45.079
Why? You don't think so?

35:45.079 --> 35:48.219
Why are you being such an amateur?

35:49.050 --> 35:50.460
Amateur?

36:01.530 --> 36:02.969
(Diagnosis)

36:05.369 --> 36:07.610
An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.

36:07.639 --> 36:08.670
(Vascular Dementia)

36:08.769 --> 36:12.380
Didn't you think I'd prepare this when he gave you those share...

36:12.940 --> 36:15.849
to such a person like you?

36:18.780 --> 36:19.949
On behalf of my father-in-law,

36:19.949 --> 36:22.019
I'm going to sue you to retrieve our shares.

36:23.989 --> 36:24.989
What?

36:30.829 --> 36:32.230
(Message, Kang K Ho)

36:34.800 --> 36:39.400
(Chairman Ahn Tae Dong Gives 53.41 Percent of His Shares)

36:39.400 --> 36:41.039
One way is...

36:41.610 --> 36:44.579
If he gave those shares while he was impaired,

36:44.639 --> 36:45.809
the shares can be retrieved.

36:48.150 --> 36:52.449
I think he got dementia after his stroke.

36:59.789 --> 37:01.230
Is life that easy for you?

37:02.530 --> 37:05.559
Things that are gained easily will be taken away easily.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.400
That's how this world works.

37:08.300 --> 37:10.769
The money you took and that diagnosis.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.769
This is the reality.

37:13.409 --> 37:15.739
A fake deserves a fake.

37:18.710 --> 37:19.980
I will give you a chance.

37:20.409 --> 37:22.050
Father passed out.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.250
Make him wake up again.

37:25.250 --> 37:27.519
I'm saying that we should start over.

37:27.789 --> 37:30.159
Fair play. No more fraud.

37:30.690 --> 37:34.730
Wake him up and take what's yours...

37:35.289 --> 37:37.030
and no more!

37:43.199 --> 37:46.369
I will wait for your call. Park Bok Ja.

38:14.099 --> 38:15.900
You should have died.

38:16.840 --> 38:18.239
Why are you still alive?

38:22.869 --> 38:23.940
You're here.

38:27.880 --> 38:30.750
My father-in-law will wake up, right?

38:32.050 --> 38:35.920
He'll wake up whenever he wants to.

39:04.750 --> 39:06.550
Are things going well, Mr. Han?

39:07.889 --> 39:09.690
I am onto something.

39:44.590 --> 39:47.989
I'm here to end you.

39:49.530 --> 39:52.599
If you do anything stupid, I'll kill you and go to jail.

39:52.630 --> 39:53.699
That simple.

39:54.099 --> 39:55.900
So, don't think to do anything stupid.

39:58.239 --> 40:00.210
- What do you want? - Money.

40:00.639 --> 40:01.639
Give it to me.

40:03.309 --> 40:05.579
You will never kill me.

40:05.579 --> 40:06.780
Are you sure about that?

40:08.250 --> 40:10.480
I will call 911 on my way out of here.

40:10.880 --> 40:16.150
If they arrive on time, maybe you'll be able to keep your life.

40:20.329 --> 40:23.130
Okay, I'll give it to you.

40:23.230 --> 40:25.559
Let go!

40:25.860 --> 40:26.900
Let go!

40:45.880 --> 40:46.989
Password.

40:49.289 --> 40:50.690
Password!

40:54.460 --> 40:57.559
3, 5...

40:57.559 --> 40:58.559
Hey.

40:59.900 --> 41:01.230
If you are lying,

41:01.369 --> 41:04.139
I will take out your eyes before I kill you.

41:10.280 --> 41:13.010
3, 5, 8...

41:17.280 --> 41:20.190
- Where do you think you're going? - If I don't go, the police comes.

41:20.889 --> 41:23.989
I asked for protection.

41:24.159 --> 41:26.489
Ma'am, this is Secretary Oh.

41:26.730 --> 41:28.730
I urgently need to tell you something.

41:40.840 --> 41:42.210
Are you hurt?

41:44.110 --> 41:45.409
It's nothing serious.

41:48.280 --> 41:49.550
What's the matter?

41:50.550 --> 41:54.849
I think Mr. Han got his information from this woman until now.

41:56.960 --> 41:59.119
Do you know who she is?

42:00.889 --> 42:02.860
She does look familiar.

42:10.639 --> 42:13.940
Okay then. Let's talk again tomorrow.

42:14.239 --> 42:15.969
Okay. Have a good rest.

42:20.079 --> 42:22.010
An attacker has entered Ms. Chairman's suite.

42:28.949 --> 42:29.949
Hurry!

42:40.070 --> 42:43.199
So, it was Secretary Oh all along. I knew it. That scumbag.

42:43.199 --> 42:45.539
No wonder he told me where you were so willingly.

42:46.039 --> 42:48.909
You two were on the same side.

42:49.269 --> 42:52.409
Tell me the password. 3, 5, 8...

42:55.650 --> 42:58.719
Hey. I told you not to think of anything stupid!

42:59.420 --> 43:00.690
No!

43:02.019 --> 43:04.389
I went through all that to get my hands on this.

43:04.619 --> 43:06.829
No! Let go!

43:15.170 --> 43:16.369
Are you okay?

43:18.300 --> 43:20.070
Did you tell Mr. Han?

43:20.440 --> 43:21.469
Well...

43:24.440 --> 43:27.449
How much do you tell Mr. Han?

43:28.110 --> 43:30.650
That Secretary Oh was in my room

43:31.980 --> 43:34.119
or Jae Gu was in my room?

43:34.119 --> 43:36.449
Or do you tell him more than that?

43:41.030 --> 43:42.559
Don't be surprised.

43:42.889 --> 43:46.099
I'm not stupid. How can I not know?

43:46.800 --> 43:50.639
I asked Mr. Han for Mr. Lee.

43:51.800 --> 43:55.670
There are no sides,

43:56.909 --> 43:59.780
no enemies and no loyalty in this world.

44:01.349 --> 44:03.420
It's all about money.

44:19.559 --> 44:21.269
It's a relief that it ended just there.

44:24.739 --> 44:27.440
I think I am well qualified now.

44:27.440 --> 44:28.940
Who is the next target?

44:28.940 --> 44:31.340
But why was Secretary Oh...

44:31.639 --> 44:34.079
in your room last night?

44:37.349 --> 44:40.789
Can't you guess what happens when a man and a woman are in a hotel...

44:40.949 --> 44:42.019
that late?

44:43.289 --> 44:44.389
I see.

44:44.889 --> 44:46.519
I guess it was a dumb question.

44:48.989 --> 44:50.900
There is a problem.

44:51.530 --> 44:55.769
Woo A Jin has Mr. Chairman's diagnosis of dementia.

44:56.940 --> 44:59.969
She's trying to turn the table by claiming impairment.

45:00.969 --> 45:02.610
She is smarter than I thought.

45:03.110 --> 45:05.039
You said A Jin, right?

45:05.639 --> 45:08.949
The one whose husband cheated...

45:10.949 --> 45:14.690
I heard that he cheated on her by cycling every day in the morning.

45:15.619 --> 45:17.119
I heard that they divorced.

45:20.730 --> 45:22.190
How did you know that?

45:38.809 --> 45:42.610
Send me the picture of the woman who met Mr. Han.

45:44.849 --> 45:47.320
If you need any help, let me know.

45:47.590 --> 45:49.849
Speaking of which, would you like to go for a drink?

45:51.059 --> 45:53.690
You seem a bit different than what I have heard.

45:54.360 --> 45:55.630
What did you hear?

45:56.530 --> 45:59.630
What did you hear about me?

45:59.699 --> 46:01.969
Nothing. I must have been confused.

46:02.099 --> 46:03.539
I am saying that you are beautiful.

46:06.809 --> 46:08.239
(Mr. Oh)

46:12.579 --> 46:16.820
Who was it?

46:17.019 --> 46:19.420
Ms. Chairman, what do you want for food?

46:20.320 --> 46:23.190
Let's just have beef rib soup and radish kimchi.

46:25.260 --> 46:26.360
Wait...

46:31.460 --> 46:33.929
I remember who she is.

46:34.099 --> 46:35.099
Hey.

46:36.300 --> 46:38.500
I'll have lunch later. I need to go somewhere.

46:45.340 --> 46:48.409
He's not answering?

46:49.179 --> 46:52.219
Darn it. I worked before my payment.

46:52.750 --> 46:55.320
Where did he flee to after leaving us here?

46:55.349 --> 46:58.219
We won't get paid if we fail, right?

46:58.219 --> 46:59.820
Shut it, punk.

47:04.760 --> 47:06.869
Let us meet Jae Gu's wife.

47:09.170 --> 47:10.739
Excuse me, ma'am.

47:10.940 --> 47:12.639
Stop calling me that!

47:15.940 --> 47:17.010
Gosh.

47:25.320 --> 47:27.889
Ms. Jo.

47:28.820 --> 47:30.559
Didn't you clean up this room yesterday?

47:31.420 --> 47:33.219
Yes, I did.

47:36.530 --> 47:38.460
Did she come by yesterday?

47:38.460 --> 47:39.960
I'm not sure.

47:40.199 --> 47:44.239
I received a call from Bang Soon. Apparently, Jae Gu can't be reached.

48:06.320 --> 48:09.730
These were all styled by A Jin.

48:09.730 --> 48:12.730
I was wondering why you look so stylish.

48:12.929 --> 48:14.429
It was A Jin, of course.

48:14.429 --> 48:17.000
- I'm thinking of asking her. - Me too.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.500
Where is A Jin?

48:27.949 --> 48:30.619
Hello. I am Ahn Jae Seok, A Jin's husband.

48:30.619 --> 48:32.050
I am here to meet A Jin.

48:32.050 --> 48:35.150
You're not her husband. You got divorced.

48:35.190 --> 48:36.989
No. It's not over yet.

48:36.989 --> 48:39.320
A Jin's ex-husband?

48:39.320 --> 48:40.659
Not an ex...

48:41.230 --> 48:42.760
The cycling cheater?

48:42.829 --> 48:45.559
Yes. The cheating Armstrong.

48:45.559 --> 48:46.900
Why is it the cheating Armstrong?

48:46.900 --> 48:49.070
Armstrong is a professional cyclist.

48:50.440 --> 48:52.400
I see.

48:52.570 --> 48:55.239
A Jin is not here. She went on a business trip.

48:56.110 --> 48:59.280
It's probably not my business, but can I tell you something?

48:59.280 --> 49:01.280
No. I hate to hear those things.

49:02.250 --> 49:05.480
Should I find a man for A Jin?

49:05.820 --> 49:08.989
Well, she likes to be in a relationship.

49:09.320 --> 49:10.889
I don't think she'll accept.

49:20.900 --> 49:22.170
I need to use the bathroom.

49:24.139 --> 49:25.400
Why did he come here?

49:25.400 --> 49:28.070
I heard that he

49:28.070 --> 49:29.440
DKHP.

49:29.739 --> 49:31.280
What does that mean?

49:31.280 --> 49:34.380
It means that he doesn't know his place.

49:35.880 --> 49:37.980
My gosh, that's insane.

49:39.119 --> 49:43.019
The phone you have dialed is turned off...

49:48.559 --> 49:51.030
Goodness. What brings you here?

49:52.130 --> 49:53.369
Let's go inside.

49:55.869 --> 49:59.070
I'm sorry, but madams are not allowed here.

50:03.039 --> 50:04.440
I didn't know such a place...

50:05.210 --> 50:06.980
existed in this world.

50:07.079 --> 50:09.780
Yes. This is such a place.

50:10.380 --> 50:12.719
Only housemaids can enter this place.

50:32.940 --> 50:36.639
I thought low-class people can't enter areas meant for high class,

50:37.780 --> 50:40.750
but high-class people can enter...

50:41.610 --> 50:44.820
wherever the low-class people can go.

50:45.179 --> 50:46.719
Are you coming back again?

50:47.349 --> 50:49.219
I thought you left for good.

50:52.219 --> 50:53.559
I see.

50:53.590 --> 50:56.699
This is where all the rumors...

50:56.730 --> 50:59.230
and news were made.

51:01.530 --> 51:02.800
Why are you doing this?

51:02.929 --> 51:04.900
I have a question.

51:05.639 --> 51:09.639
What do you think the people of Daesung Pulp will do to me?

51:09.769 --> 51:11.980
- How could I know? - Hey.

51:12.739 --> 51:14.309
I bet you know.

51:14.510 --> 51:18.449
Didn't you get information from a man named Han Min Gi?

51:24.289 --> 51:26.119
Leeway and foul play.

51:26.760 --> 51:29.230
Those are the things that you need to survive in this place.

51:30.260 --> 51:33.869
That's what you need to move up in class.

51:37.570 --> 51:38.900
Since we're alone,

51:39.699 --> 51:41.039
do you want some tea?

51:48.809 --> 51:50.579
(Gu Bong Cheol, Age 36, Male)

51:52.949 --> 51:54.989
Was this person discharged from the hospital?

51:54.989 --> 51:57.489
Yes, he was discharged and left the hospital an hour ago.

52:15.070 --> 52:17.539
- Hello? - Hello, ma'am.

52:18.079 --> 52:19.579
This is Gu Bong Cheol.

52:20.510 --> 52:23.150
- Gu Bong Cheol? - I was the physical therapist...

52:24.150 --> 52:25.679
for Mr. Chairman. The tent incident...

52:26.820 --> 52:28.019
Why did you call me?

52:28.289 --> 52:30.159
I need to tell you something.

52:31.489 --> 52:33.789
Okay. Where do you want to meet?

52:34.460 --> 52:37.030
Do you know what the scariest emotion is?

52:37.230 --> 52:38.230
Desire?

52:39.099 --> 52:41.269
No. It's jealousy.

52:42.869 --> 52:46.469
All the housemaids in this room were jealous of you.

52:48.769 --> 52:51.309
Weren't you the one...

52:52.909 --> 52:54.349
who was the most jealous?

53:02.289 --> 53:04.489
Tell me everything you know about me.

53:05.159 --> 53:07.659
Based on all the information you have gathered,

53:08.559 --> 53:12.599
what do you think will end up happening to me?

53:14.900 --> 53:16.769
I think maybe,

53:19.039 --> 53:21.039
you will end up dead.

53:39.519 --> 53:41.190
There must be something you want to say.

53:47.030 --> 53:48.469
Park Bok Ja and I...

53:50.039 --> 53:52.139
knew each other from the orphanage.

54:44.960 --> 54:47.030
She forced me to do it.

54:47.260 --> 54:49.030
We strategically approached him.

54:49.889 --> 54:51.429
I gave Bok Ja...

54:52.659 --> 54:54.530
information about Mr. Chairman.

54:56.070 --> 54:58.900
The goal was to seduce Mr. Chairman and get something for ourselves.

55:00.909 --> 55:02.610
Indeed. I see.

55:02.940 --> 55:03.940
But...

55:05.239 --> 55:06.949
she knew about you.

55:08.050 --> 55:10.349
Even before I told her about you,

55:11.780 --> 55:13.719
she knew your name.

55:28.300 --> 55:30.670
You shouldn't have trusted me.

55:34.909 --> 55:37.610
You shouldn't have fallen for me.

55:49.519 --> 55:52.489
You can never make it to the upper class.

55:52.989 --> 55:55.190
Even though you have a lot of money,

55:55.260 --> 55:57.659
you're nothing more than a caregiver for the sick.

56:34.329 --> 56:36.940
- Hello? - I am looking for a caregiver.

56:39.369 --> 56:42.909
Just help him become more happy...

56:42.909 --> 56:44.380
and healthy.

56:44.809 --> 56:47.250
I will pay you more for that.

56:52.150 --> 56:55.219
This is your opportunity to repent your sins.

56:55.650 --> 56:57.690
Make everything right.

57:05.030 --> 57:06.500
But ma'am.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.699
Hiring a person is a big deal.

57:13.769 --> 57:16.570
You shouldn't be hiring people so easily.

57:19.579 --> 57:21.409
There must be some qualifications.

57:24.519 --> 57:28.349
A person who likes Matisse and Kandinsky would be nice.

57:48.409 --> 57:50.280
Park Bok Ja.

57:51.909 --> 57:53.139
Woo A Jin.

58:15.300 --> 58:19.670
I'm no longer a caregiver of your house.

58:19.670 --> 58:20.969
Why so late at night?

58:20.969 --> 58:23.010
Why else? Because I miss you.

58:23.010 --> 58:26.309
Who's the one person that your mom and dad cherish the most?

58:26.309 --> 58:27.309
It's you.

58:27.309 --> 58:31.219
If you knew that, why did you do it? You're still too immature.

58:31.219 --> 58:34.389
I will never give up on this house. I've lost too much because of you.

58:34.389 --> 58:35.389
You punk!

58:36.760 --> 58:39.289
Mr. Han is very sly.

58:39.289 --> 58:41.190
It seems like Mr. Han has a hidden agenda.

58:41.190 --> 58:42.530
Do you think I'm a joke?

58:42.530 --> 58:45.559
You're not suited for this world. You're too emotional.

58:45.599 --> 58:47.699
You're a piece of trash.

58:47.699 --> 58:49.300
Everything was planned.

58:49.300 --> 58:52.070
The uphill climb was easier than you thought, wasn't it?

58:52.070 --> 58:54.809
Your climb back down will be even easier. Look forward to it.

58:54.809 --> 58:57.780
- Where is my husband? - How am I supposed to know that?

58:57.780 --> 58:59.010
If you don't, who does?

58:59.010 --> 59:01.309
You kept Ahn Jae Gu alive, right?

59:01.309 --> 59:04.320
Give the money back! I have to give it back to the bank.

59:04.320 --> 59:05.980
If I don't, we'll all die!

59:05.980 --> 59:08.250
- Don't lay a finger on that house. - It's already too late.

59:08.250 --> 59:10.260
This household is done for.

59:10.260 --> 59:13.989
Jae Hui, that crazy wench gave this house to the bank as collateral!

59:13.989 --> 59:16.260
I'm the one who brought you into that house.

59:16.260 --> 59:18.760
I should take responsibility for what I've done.

59:18.760 --> 59:21.630
I will never have it taken away from me.
