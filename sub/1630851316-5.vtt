WEBVTT

00:35.774 --> 00:37.080
Is it too late
to change my mind?

00:37.124 --> 00:38.168
Out.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.743
So, like, where's
the facility, bruh?

00:47.786 --> 00:50.441
You're looking at it...
bruh.

00:50.485 --> 00:52.748
Where the hell
you come from?

00:54.924 --> 00:56.578
Let's go.

00:56.621 --> 00:59.668
No, there's no way
I'm going in there.

00:59.711 --> 01:01.365
Listen up.

01:01.409 --> 01:03.802
You all may be juvies,
but apparently

01:03.846 --> 01:06.588
you're all such badasses,
you're being charged as adults.

01:06.631 --> 01:08.590
But the court gave you a choice.

01:08.633 --> 01:11.375
In there with me
for a week...

01:11.419 --> 01:13.421
or the big house.

01:13.464 --> 01:14.987
Take your pick.

01:15.031 --> 01:17.512
I'm eating rabbit for dinner
either way.

01:24.171 --> 01:25.824
Yo, wait up!

01:27.043 --> 01:28.784
So what's the plan, exactly?

01:28.827 --> 01:31.265
We play <i>Survivor</i> for a week
and then become

01:31.308 --> 01:32.701
fine, upstanding citizens?

01:32.744 --> 01:33.876
Yeah, where do we sleep?

01:33.919 --> 01:35.007
Yeah, I'm not eating
no rabbit.

01:35.051 --> 01:37.271
Then you don't eat.

01:37.314 --> 01:38.881
And the plan is,
is that you learn

01:38.924 --> 01:40.404
to get your head on right, son.

01:40.448 --> 01:41.927
By murdering Thumper?

01:41.971 --> 01:43.842
By learning to live for
something besides yourselves.

01:43.886 --> 01:45.844
I read your psych evals.

01:45.888 --> 01:48.325
You all think the world
revolves around you.

01:48.369 --> 01:51.241
But out here,
if you don't work together,

01:51.285 --> 01:52.677
you die together.

01:52.721 --> 01:54.897
So you gonna learn
to become a team.

01:54.940 --> 01:56.638
No matter what comes our way,

01:56.681 --> 01:59.119
we stand as one.

02:04.646 --> 02:10.739
Run!

02:12.132 --> 02:14.264
Okay.
Wow.

02:14.308 --> 02:15.091
Nice.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.746
Dude, this looks so fake.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.396
Can you please
pace somewhere else?

02:59.440 --> 03:01.920
You are going to
wear down the carpet.

03:01.964 --> 03:04.358
Well, it needs replacing
anyways.

03:04.401 --> 03:05.620
Where is he already?

03:05.663 --> 03:07.099
Maybe text him
another ten times?

03:09.276 --> 03:10.494
Morning.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.801
Morning? Like, uh,

03:12.844 --> 03:14.106
just like everything's
normal morning?

03:14.150 --> 03:16.892
Why haven't you answered
any of my texts?

03:16.935 --> 03:18.763
I'm sorry, I just got back
from Alaska, okay?

03:18.807 --> 03:19.895
I'm a little jet-lagged.

03:19.938 --> 03:21.462
Guess what the next
question is.

03:21.505 --> 03:23.115
How could you leave
Gibbs behind?

03:23.159 --> 03:25.379
I didn't leave him behind,
okay, he wanted to stay.

03:25.422 --> 03:28.164
And you agreed to this...
why again?

03:31.428 --> 03:32.777
Because he seemed happy.

03:32.821 --> 03:34.823
- Happy?

03:34.866 --> 03:38.174
As in, like, <i>happy?</i>

03:38.218 --> 03:41.090
Well, I've got some more
of that to go around.

03:41.133 --> 03:44.963
Uh, I'm sure you'll all
probably be happy to hear

03:45.007 --> 03:47.705
that I've decided not to
take Director Vance up

03:47.749 --> 03:50.012
on his offer to join your team.

03:52.797 --> 03:55.670
And I'm guessing that's
the first you've heard of it.

03:55.713 --> 03:58.281
I was waiting for
Agent McGee to return

03:58.325 --> 03:59.456
before I filled them in.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.763
And you're early.

04:03.199 --> 04:06.246
Oops. Sidebar?

04:07.334 --> 04:10.554
Uh, I appreciate the offer,
Director, but I'm not ready

04:10.598 --> 04:12.295
to jump into anything new
just yet.

04:12.339 --> 04:14.645
Perhaps you'd like to spend some
time in the field with the team

04:14.689 --> 04:16.647
before you make your
final decision?

04:16.691 --> 04:17.953
I already made it.

04:17.996 --> 04:19.955
Plus, I got tickets to
a Simon and Garfunkel

04:19.998 --> 04:22.610
reunion concert later today,

04:22.653 --> 04:25.352
and I've been waiting
a long time for that baby, so...

04:25.395 --> 04:28.180
Hey, why are you guys
standing around here?

04:28.224 --> 04:29.834
- Haven't you guys heard?
- Whoa, what's up?

04:29.878 --> 04:33.534
A Navy petty officer apparently
turned into a zombie.

04:33.577 --> 04:34.883
- A zombie?
- Yeah.

04:34.926 --> 04:36.363
Crawled out of the ground
and everything.

04:36.406 --> 04:37.973
You guys really
didn't get the call?

04:38.016 --> 04:40.280
That kind of thing happen
a lot around here?

04:40.323 --> 04:41.585
First for me.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.674
Ooh. All right, get your gear.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.676
Well, it looks
like the train's leaving.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.765
I'd consider it
a personal favor

04:47.809 --> 04:50.072
if at least you'd spend
the morning on it.

04:50.115 --> 04:53.162
Well, I don't think I'll
change my mind, Director,

04:53.205 --> 04:56.296
but, uh, yeah, okay, sure.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.688
I still got time.

04:57.732 --> 05:00.561
Zombie it is.

05:02.214 --> 05:03.607
Not a zombie.

05:03.651 --> 05:06.175
Just a victim who suffered
from extreme dehydration

05:06.218 --> 05:07.655
and exposure before he died.

05:07.698 --> 05:08.830
Who is this guy again?

05:08.873 --> 05:10.179
Well, according
to his prints,

05:10.222 --> 05:12.790
he was Petty Officer First Class
James Bolton.

05:12.834 --> 05:13.835
Whoever dumped the body

05:13.878 --> 05:14.879
barely covered it up.

05:16.403 --> 05:17.491
Except he wasn't a body
when he was dumped.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.188
Apparently, this guy
was still alive.

05:19.231 --> 05:21.233
Died shortly after
Ranger Rick stepped on him.

05:21.277 --> 05:22.409
And he died of what?

05:22.452 --> 05:23.845
Based on the nasal froth,
I'd say it was

05:23.888 --> 05:25.368
poison that probably
put him into

05:25.412 --> 05:26.761
a cataplectic coma.

05:26.804 --> 05:28.893
Probably fooled whoever
tried to bury him here

05:28.937 --> 05:30.155
into thinking that
he was dead.

05:30.199 --> 05:32.593
It happens. I'll know
a little bit more

05:32.636 --> 05:34.508
when I get him back to autopsy.

05:34.551 --> 05:37.598
Speaking of which,
can I get a hand

05:37.641 --> 05:39.426
with the body and the gurney?

05:39.469 --> 05:41.906
I gave myself a grade-two sprain

05:41.950 --> 05:43.734
inflating a bouncy house.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.867
It happens.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.521
You need help
getting the Night King

05:47.564 --> 05:48.870
into the van, too?

05:48.913 --> 05:51.089
Well, aren't you thoughtful.
Yes, I do.

05:52.656 --> 05:54.223
Ready?

05:54.266 --> 05:56.791
You know, I-I looked up
how many injuries

05:56.834 --> 05:58.793
are caused
by bouncy houses.

05:58.836 --> 06:00.055
Hey, Tim.
It's a lot.

06:00.098 --> 06:03.406
When you said that
Gibbs was happy...

06:03.450 --> 06:04.494
what did you mean?

06:04.538 --> 06:06.975
I don't want to
talk about it.

06:07.018 --> 06:09.456
Look, you can't-- you can't
leave me hanging, bro.

06:09.499 --> 06:10.674
I'm sorry, it felt
kind of private.

06:10.718 --> 06:13.024
Well, is he gonna be okay?

06:14.765 --> 06:17.986
I think he probably hasn't
been this okay in a long time.

06:20.641 --> 06:22.947
What about that guy?

06:22.991 --> 06:24.166
Can you believe Director Vance

06:24.209 --> 06:26.908
offered him Gibbs' job already?

06:26.951 --> 06:29.214
He's a solid agent.
Experienced.

06:29.258 --> 06:30.781
The man's desk
is not even cold.

06:30.825 --> 06:33.610
Well, it's just gonna get colder
with Gibbs in Alaska,

06:33.654 --> 06:34.655
and we do need the body.

06:34.698 --> 06:36.178
McGee, help me out here.

06:37.832 --> 06:40.530
Tim, this is where
- you use more words.
- Sorry, I'm all out.

06:40.574 --> 06:42.097
And I'm all out of time.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.446
Oh, leaving us so soon?

06:43.490 --> 06:46.057
Yeah. And I'm sure you're
real broken up about it.

06:46.101 --> 06:48.190
But can't keep
Mrs. Robinson waiting.

06:48.233 --> 06:51.628
Agent McGee, I wish you
the best of luck.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.325
Been a blast.

07:05.468 --> 07:08.732
That kind of thing happen
a lot around here?

07:17.698 --> 07:19.743
Where are they?

07:21.397 --> 07:24.487
I've been worried sick.
Thank God you're okay.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.141
Don't worry,
Kasie, we're fine.

07:26.184 --> 07:27.316
What happened?

07:27.359 --> 07:28.360
Your vic had some kind
of bomb on him,

07:28.404 --> 07:29.492
that's what happened.

07:29.536 --> 07:30.798
Where's Knight?

07:30.841 --> 07:32.669
And what was the dead guy
doing with a bomb?

07:32.713 --> 07:34.889
She's towing what's left
of the van

07:34.932 --> 07:36.934
into the evidence garage, trying
to figure out what happened.

07:36.978 --> 07:39.067
- Feel free to go help.
- Roger that.

07:39.110 --> 07:41.722
This is all I could dig up
on your dead petty officer.

07:41.765 --> 07:43.027
It's not much.

07:43.071 --> 07:45.160
- Let's see what we got.
- Hey, it's Parker.

07:46.640 --> 07:47.945
Yeah, it's not much.

07:47.989 --> 07:50.121
Petty Officer Bolton,
born in St. Louis.

07:50.165 --> 07:52.036
Studied computer
science in college,

07:52.080 --> 07:53.342
and the rest is redacted.

07:53.385 --> 07:55.300
Uh, yeah, I'm gonna be
a little late.

07:55.344 --> 07:57.955
I don't even recognize
that assignment code.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.479
It's a transitional code

07:59.522 --> 08:02.003
that our new space force
just started using.

08:02.046 --> 08:04.614
Yeah. No, no.
No, I-I'll see you there later.

08:04.658 --> 08:05.572
Okay.

08:05.615 --> 08:06.834
And you know this how?

08:06.877 --> 08:09.227
I did some work integrating
their network

08:09.271 --> 08:12.361
into the FBI's Operational
Technology Division.

08:12.404 --> 08:14.102
Happy to hook you up
with a guy there I know.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.538
He can probably give you
some more intel

08:15.582 --> 08:16.931
on your petty officer.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.802
You know, it'd be faster
if you made the call.

08:18.846 --> 08:21.457
I'd love to, but, uh,
I'm already gonna miss

08:21.501 --> 08:23.720
half the warm-up act, so...

08:28.899 --> 08:32.163
Okay, I still got time.

08:34.644 --> 08:37.821
While we may never know
the true origin

08:37.865 --> 08:40.171
of the Humpty Dumpty
nursery rhyme,

08:40.215 --> 08:42.652
you can rest assured,
Petty Officer Bolton,

08:42.696 --> 08:45.089
we shall put you together again.

08:45.133 --> 08:49.398
Yes, lateral malleolus.

08:49.441 --> 08:52.836
Thanks for helping while
I have my own lateral issues.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.404
It's just
like old times, huh?

08:55.447 --> 08:59.408
I don't recall the M.E. van
blowing up before,

08:59.451 --> 09:01.323
so... no.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.543
Well, the good news is,
you'll be getting a new one.

09:03.586 --> 09:04.848
I kinda liked the old one.

09:04.892 --> 09:07.024
You shouldn't have
let it be blown up.

09:07.068 --> 09:08.286
Oh, we're doing that
again, are we?

09:08.330 --> 09:10.245
So, we were kinda hoping
for an update,

09:10.288 --> 09:11.855
but I can come back
if the two of you...

09:11.899 --> 09:13.814
Oh, no, no, no. It's fine.
It's fine. Dr. Mallard?

09:13.857 --> 09:16.556
Yes, well, one item
of note is an anklet

09:16.599 --> 09:20.037
that the petty officer was
wearing on his left foot.

09:20.081 --> 09:23.954
It appears to be some kind
of wearable USB device.

09:23.998 --> 09:26.740
Kasie is examining it now.

09:26.783 --> 09:29.917
She also identified the
explosive that destroyed, uh...

09:31.483 --> 09:32.789
...certain things.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.878
It was azidoazide azide,

09:34.922 --> 09:38.055
a compound so powerful
and unstable,

09:38.099 --> 09:39.796
only crazy people use it.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.885
And, apparently, criminals.

09:41.929 --> 09:46.586
Only a few ounces can
totally destroy a vehicle.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.936
Or a van.

09:48.979 --> 09:50.154
Ounces?

09:50.198 --> 09:51.678
No wonder we missed the bomb
on the body.

09:51.721 --> 09:52.940
Oh, we didn't miss the bomb,

09:52.983 --> 09:54.681
because it wasn't on the body.

09:54.724 --> 09:57.335
See, the blast trauma
to the thorax

09:57.379 --> 09:59.903
projects outwards,
meaning that the explosion

09:59.947 --> 10:02.427
emanated from inside
the G.I. tract.

10:02.471 --> 10:05.648
Are you saying our victim
swallowed the explosive?

10:05.692 --> 10:07.215
It appears so.

10:07.258 --> 10:09.609
Reminds me of a few heroin
smugglers I busted once.

10:09.652 --> 10:13.438
Except Petty Officer Bolton
wasn't smuggling heroin.

10:13.482 --> 10:16.267
He was concealing an explosive,

10:16.311 --> 10:21.142
presumably to get past
some sort of security.

10:21.185 --> 10:24.362
Agent Knight, we believe
that this was

10:24.406 --> 10:26.582
a bombing attempt gone wrong.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.628
Given the location
of the explosive,

10:28.671 --> 10:31.761
most likely a suicide
bombing attempt.

10:31.805 --> 10:35.417
By a member of the
United States military.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.680
<i>Yes, we're still trying
to figure out</i>

10:37.724 --> 10:40.074
the target, Madam Secretary.

10:40.117 --> 10:41.684
Yeah, I'll let you know
as soon as we do.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.686
Thank you.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.949
I heard we have
an official cause of death

10:45.993 --> 10:47.864
- for Petty Officer Bolton?
- Blood poisoning.

10:47.908 --> 10:49.170
Jimmy thinks that the explosive

10:49.213 --> 10:51.085
accidentally leaked
into his system

10:51.128 --> 10:53.043
and killed him before
he could detonate himself.

10:53.087 --> 10:55.219
Oh, this could have been
a lot worse.

10:55.263 --> 10:57.047
Uh, any idea
who dumped the body?

10:57.091 --> 11:00.877
Not yet, but Bolton was
obviously working with someone.

11:00.921 --> 11:04.446
All right, let me know
when you find out who.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.057
Is there something else?

11:07.101 --> 11:08.755
- You're not gonna like it.
- Try me.

11:08.798 --> 11:11.714
You should've never
offered Parker the job.

11:11.758 --> 11:14.151
And why is that?

11:14.195 --> 11:16.458
You gave up on Gibbs
too quickly.

11:16.501 --> 11:20.070
Nobody gave up on anyone.
Gibbs moved on.

11:20.114 --> 11:21.463
And you let it happen.

11:24.466 --> 11:27.599
I know that Gibbs is
a father figure to the team.

11:27.643 --> 11:30.254
And it's hard
when a father leaves,

11:30.298 --> 11:31.734
especially, perhaps, for you.

11:31.778 --> 11:32.735
If I needed a shrink,
I would have called

11:32.779 --> 11:34.432
Dr. Grace, Director.

11:34.476 --> 11:37.174
Agent Torres, may I remind you
that I'm free to hire

11:37.218 --> 11:38.654
who I want, when I want?

11:38.698 --> 11:39.916
Well, did you even
consider McGee?

11:39.960 --> 11:41.004
I did more than consider him.

11:41.048 --> 11:43.050
What is that supposed to mean?

11:43.093 --> 11:45.400
- That's outside your pay grade.
- Oh, okay.

11:45.443 --> 11:47.663
Well, I'm telling you
that Agent Parker is

11:47.707 --> 11:48.708
the wrong guy for the job.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.187
Then you should
tell that to Gibbs.

11:53.364 --> 11:55.497
He said he was the guy?

11:55.540 --> 11:57.368
We spoke just after
Eberhart's arrest.

11:57.412 --> 12:00.110
Let's just say I think Parker
made an impression on Gibbs

12:00.154 --> 12:02.722
in Alaska, as well as on me.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.290
So, we done?

12:14.211 --> 12:16.474
Director, we got a problem.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.433
And you're not gonna like it.

12:18.476 --> 12:21.436
Get in line.

12:21.479 --> 12:23.786
Whoever dumped
the petty officer's body

12:23.830 --> 12:25.440
took his wallet and keys.

12:25.483 --> 12:27.007
Well, it's no surprise.
It makes it harder

12:27.050 --> 12:28.269
to make an ID.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.837
But they left another
set of keys behind.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.274
It's the USB drive
Jimmy and Ducky found.

12:33.317 --> 12:36.103
The body dumper probably thought
it was just a piece of jewelry.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.801
'Cause Navy petty officers

12:38.845 --> 12:40.716
are so totally known
for wearing anklets.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.717
Okay, get to the point.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.197
The drive appears to be

12:43.240 --> 12:45.286
some kind of master key

12:45.329 --> 12:49.420
to an e-commerce site that
- Bolton runs on the dark web.
- Dark web?

12:49.464 --> 12:51.379
That's great.
What was he selling?

12:51.422 --> 12:53.598
Uh, it seems our
computer science major

12:53.642 --> 12:57.298
has been moonlighting as a
one-man Geek Squad for bad guys.

12:57.341 --> 12:58.603
This guy does everything.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.301
"Corporate hacking,
$1,000 an hour.

13:00.344 --> 13:02.303
- Ransomware attack"?
- Mm-hmm.

13:02.346 --> 13:05.480
Even has a weekend special
on tracking your spouse.

13:05.523 --> 13:07.308
You're right, Ms. Hines,
we got a problem.

13:07.351 --> 13:08.962
This isn't the problem.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.312
Most of Bolton's posts
have been about

13:11.355 --> 13:13.140
the finer points
of identity theft,

13:13.183 --> 13:14.489
until a few months ago.

13:14.532 --> 13:16.839
He mentions he got
a new partner.

13:16.883 --> 13:19.015
Then his posts started
getting political.

13:19.059 --> 13:20.756
Then extremist.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.498
Then he says he and his partner
have something big planned.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.979
Like "take down the system" big.

13:26.022 --> 13:28.808
And you know what
- that target is?
Maybe.

13:28.851 --> 13:32.420
And I hope we're wrong.
All right, thanks, Fish.

13:32.463 --> 13:35.727
My contact at DoD says that
Bolton's day job was

13:35.771 --> 13:37.164
working as a high-level coder

13:37.207 --> 13:39.731
for the Wideband Global
SATCOM system.

13:39.775 --> 13:40.994
One of the satellite networks

13:41.037 --> 13:42.822
our military uses
to communicate.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.084
Bolton's clearance level
gave him access

13:44.127 --> 13:45.694
to a highly sensitive
server room

13:45.737 --> 13:46.956
that runs the entire system.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.697
Not the sort of place you'd want

13:48.740 --> 13:50.655
a bomb to go off in,
I'd imagine.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.135
If that was Bolton's target...

13:52.179 --> 13:55.312
And you really have no choice
but to assume that it was.

13:55.356 --> 13:57.184
He's trying to take down
our satellites.

13:57.227 --> 13:59.490
And his partner's
still out there.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.109
You believe Petty Officer Bolton

14:09.152 --> 14:11.024
was planning an attack
on his own country?

14:11.067 --> 14:12.503
Why?

14:12.547 --> 14:14.679
Well, our working theory is
that Bolton got radicalized

14:14.723 --> 14:16.464
by this mystery partner
of his.

14:16.507 --> 14:18.727
Who clearly had some issues
with the military.

14:18.770 --> 14:21.382
SATCOM handles
tactical command,

14:21.425 --> 14:24.080
control comms,
missile targeting.

14:24.124 --> 14:26.082
And if any of those
systems go down,

14:26.126 --> 14:28.519
our troops' ability
to defend themselves abroad

14:28.563 --> 14:29.303
could be hobbled.

14:29.346 --> 14:30.652
Uh, if I may, General,

14:30.695 --> 14:32.959
I've worked with the SATCOM
system before.

14:33.002 --> 14:35.483
I recall.
You brought the scones.

14:35.526 --> 14:37.877
And if I recall, it uses

14:37.920 --> 14:40.227
Hyper-V clustering
for redundancy.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.707
Taking out any one facility
won't immediately

14:42.751 --> 14:45.449
degrade the system.
We have some time.

14:45.493 --> 14:47.495
Which we need,
'cause we might have

14:47.538 --> 14:49.062
more suicide bombers
out there.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.020
- Might?
- We found several posts

14:51.064 --> 14:52.979
indicating that Bolton
and his partner

14:53.022 --> 14:54.676
were trying to recruit
more people.

14:54.719 --> 14:57.418
What if they recruited
someone else with clearance?

14:57.461 --> 14:59.463
We can't be doing
full body searches

14:59.507 --> 15:01.291
at every federal facility.

15:01.335 --> 15:03.511
Director Vance,
I'm authorizing an emergency

15:03.554 --> 15:07.689
rapid response task force
- to be run out of NCIS.
- Understood.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.169
Agent Parker...

15:09.212 --> 15:10.779
Actually, it's <i>former
Agent Parker.</i>

15:10.822 --> 15:12.999
I don't care.
You know the systems,

15:13.042 --> 15:14.391
you're running the task force.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.045
If there's any recruits
out there,

15:16.089 --> 15:17.481
I want you to find them.

15:17.525 --> 15:20.049
Funny thing, I got tickets...

15:21.181 --> 15:26.099
Scratch that.
Understood, General.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.840
Well, that sucks for me.

15:28.884 --> 15:31.669
- You know the systems.
- Hyper-V clustering.

15:33.758 --> 15:34.890
Torres, mystery partner.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.718
McGee's already got
potential targets.

15:36.761 --> 15:38.285
Knight, we need to know if
anyone else has been recruited.

15:38.328 --> 15:39.416
Okay, let's go.

15:43.072 --> 15:46.075
Right. Um...

15:47.207 --> 15:50.253
...the 411 may play better
coming from you.

15:50.297 --> 15:52.168
Listen, guys, Agent Parker...

15:52.212 --> 15:53.735
Former.

15:53.778 --> 15:57.347
Former Agent Parker
has been assigned by the DoD...

15:57.391 --> 15:59.001
Let me guess.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.089
Be in charge?

16:00.133 --> 16:01.351
Temporarily.

16:01.395 --> 16:02.918
But for the record,
against my will.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.486
But here we are.

16:07.879 --> 16:12.188
Okay, so I'm not really sure
what I'm supposed to be doing,

16:12.232 --> 16:14.190
but if I'm the one
who's looking for

16:14.234 --> 16:15.626
new suicide bomber recruits,

16:15.670 --> 16:19.674
I've got Petty Officer
Bolton's laptop.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.241
But it's locked.

16:21.284 --> 16:24.200
It may have information on it
that's relevant to our case.

16:24.244 --> 16:28.596
I'm just waiting for someone
to... do that.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.337
I just needed to enable
route access.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.078
That's normally McGee's thing.

16:32.121 --> 16:34.210
Oh, I don't mean
to step on any toes.

16:34.254 --> 16:36.256
No, no, it's okay.

16:36.299 --> 16:37.648
But as long as you got it open,

16:37.692 --> 16:39.955
Kasie flagged a name
on Bolton's server.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.436
Told someone he was gonna
"check the guy out."

16:42.479 --> 16:43.654
- You thinking it's a recruit?
- If it is,

16:43.698 --> 16:45.395
Bolton should have
a file on him.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.571
And there you go.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.443
Royman Beesbo?

16:49.486 --> 16:51.967
You're being groomed to be
a suicide bomber, Royman?

16:52.011 --> 16:54.404
Let's see, he's single,
has no social life.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.363
Said he almost died
of a heart attack last year.

16:56.406 --> 16:58.887
Dying man, no family.
That fits the profile.

16:58.930 --> 17:01.890
Torres, Knight, check him out.
McGee, dig into the laptop.

17:01.933 --> 17:04.110
Find out who
Bolton's mystery partner was.

17:04.153 --> 17:06.547
And-and, hey, look, um,

17:06.590 --> 17:10.116
I just want you all to know
I-I know this is weird.

17:10.159 --> 17:11.813
Okay, I get it.
But we got to get

17:11.856 --> 17:14.076
past that so we can
get this job done.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.209
And with a team like you,

17:16.252 --> 17:18.950
we're gonna do it
better than anyone.

17:18.994 --> 17:21.083
The only question I have is,

17:21.127 --> 17:25.870
do you guys ever go to the
bathroom, and where is it?

17:25.914 --> 17:28.830
Because I'm literally
about to wet myself.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.708
Hey.

17:37.752 --> 17:39.145
Hey, bud, can I ask you
something?

17:39.188 --> 17:40.668
Uh, now?

17:40.711 --> 17:42.844
Well, time isn't really
on our side,

17:42.887 --> 17:44.541
and I wanted to clear the air.

17:44.585 --> 17:46.152
You know, I probably had,
like, three cups of coffee

17:46.195 --> 17:47.588
this morning, but...

17:47.631 --> 17:49.198
Why didn't you make a play
for Gibbs' job?

17:49.242 --> 17:52.332
Well, because it was
Gibbs' job.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.290
At least as of
a few days ago.

17:54.334 --> 17:55.987
Come on.

17:56.031 --> 17:58.381
The writing was
on the wall for months.

17:58.425 --> 17:59.861
You know, it was probably,
like, four cups...

17:59.904 --> 18:02.168
And you never thought
about making team leader

18:02.211 --> 18:03.647
a permanent gig?

18:03.691 --> 18:07.347
Um, yeah, yeah, sure.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.131
I-I imagined it happening
one day, yeah.

18:09.175 --> 18:14.005
And then Vance offered you
the job, and you said pass. Why?

18:14.049 --> 18:17.531
The job wasn't what
I thought it would be.

18:17.574 --> 18:20.316
You know, not,
not nearly as fun.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.013
Hours were even worse.

18:22.057 --> 18:24.581
Don't get to go out
- in the field as much.
- Uh-huh.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.627
Plus, there's all that
paperwork.

18:26.670 --> 18:31.022
- Nobody likes paperwork.
- Right?

18:31.066 --> 18:33.503
And that's it?

18:33.547 --> 18:35.157
Yeah, well, what else is there?

18:35.201 --> 18:37.028
You tell me.

18:37.072 --> 18:40.510
No, that's it.

18:44.297 --> 18:45.689
Hey, uh, next time
you want to have

18:45.733 --> 18:48.214
a private conversation with me,
maybe pick somewhere

18:48.257 --> 18:49.563
a little more appropriate.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.131
Maybe a stopped elevator
or something.

18:59.355 --> 19:01.966
That's got to be Royman.

19:04.273 --> 19:05.318
Ow.

19:08.190 --> 19:11.454
- Are we sure he's single?
- Don't be mean.

19:11.498 --> 19:14.762
I'm sorry, I'm feeling
a little mean.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.765
You got to give Parker a chance.

19:17.808 --> 19:19.332
Do I?

19:19.375 --> 19:21.290
After what he did
for Gibbs in Alaska,

19:21.334 --> 19:23.771
I'd say he earned it.

19:26.208 --> 19:30.299
Recruit me to be
a suicide bomber?

19:30.343 --> 19:32.823
Me?

19:32.867 --> 19:34.738
This is a joke, right?

19:40.918 --> 19:43.312
Has anybody strange
contacted you online recently?

19:43.356 --> 19:45.488
Pretty much nonstop
after I dipped my toe

19:45.532 --> 19:46.794
into online dating.

19:46.837 --> 19:48.317
It was like I had
a catfish target

19:48.361 --> 19:50.232
on my back for some reason.

19:50.276 --> 19:52.495
At least until I met Helen,

19:52.539 --> 19:54.410
and then I erased
all my dating apps.

19:54.454 --> 19:57.326
- So you're not single?
- Well...

19:57.370 --> 19:59.981
I mean, it's, it's kind
of hard to explain.

20:00.024 --> 20:01.983
Is Helen someone strange

20:02.026 --> 20:04.159
that you met online
by any chance?
No.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.117
At a bus stop.

20:06.161 --> 20:07.380
We just started talking.

20:07.423 --> 20:08.772
I don't know how that happened.

20:08.816 --> 20:11.949
Then she smiled,
and it was like

20:11.993 --> 20:14.735
a lightning bolt
went off in my head.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.171
And I know she felt it, too,

20:16.215 --> 20:19.479
because she gave me
her number.

20:19.522 --> 20:21.350
And then what happened?

20:21.394 --> 20:22.525
And then I lost it.

20:23.309 --> 20:24.571
I've been trying
to remember it, you know,

20:24.614 --> 20:28.052
by doing...

20:28.096 --> 20:29.576
Oh.

20:29.619 --> 20:32.405
So you are single.

20:32.448 --> 20:34.145
Do you recognize this guy?

20:34.189 --> 20:37.236
Yeah. Yeah, that's
the cable guy.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.411
He came by a few weeks ago,

20:38.454 --> 20:39.890
said I needed a new
router or something.

20:39.934 --> 20:42.284
That's not the cable guy.

20:42.328 --> 20:46.767
Wait, is that your suicide
bomber recruiter dude?

20:46.810 --> 20:49.726
Oh, my gobsmacker,
he-he was in my house.

20:49.770 --> 20:50.945
We had lemonade.

20:50.988 --> 20:53.252
Wh-Why-why was he
trying to recruit me?

20:53.295 --> 20:54.427
What do you do, exactly, again?

20:54.470 --> 20:56.211
Are you some kind of
a court reporter?

20:56.255 --> 20:58.735
Uh, not quite.

20:58.779 --> 21:02.086
Try a Silverstar-ranked
federal stenographer.

21:02.130 --> 21:03.262
What does that mean?

21:03.305 --> 21:05.002
I work on sealed cases only.

21:05.046 --> 21:08.267
I'm one of only 50 local stenos
cleared to record depositions

21:08.310 --> 21:09.920
that involve classified
material.

21:09.964 --> 21:13.097
Does that mean you go into
- high security federal buildings?
- Yep.

21:13.141 --> 21:14.273
Different ones every week.

21:14.316 --> 21:18.015
I see a lot of
really high-tech... Oh.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.930
Where are you going next?
It could be a target.

21:19.974 --> 21:23.325
I can't actually answer that
without a subpoena.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.153
That's part of being a Silver...

21:25.196 --> 21:27.329
Silverstar-ranked federal
stenographer. Got it.

21:27.373 --> 21:30.463
But you're more than welcome
to hang till you get one.

21:30.506 --> 21:33.422
I got, I got nachos. Huh?

21:34.728 --> 21:37.687
Well, how long's a subpoena
gonna take?

21:37.731 --> 21:39.080
That's too long, Judge.

21:39.123 --> 21:41.212
Anyplace this Royman
guy goes next

21:41.256 --> 21:42.910
could be a bombing target.

21:42.953 --> 21:45.086
Royman? I don't know, Irish?

21:45.129 --> 21:47.044
No, no, don't put me
on hold again!

21:47.088 --> 21:48.829
Well, what do you think?

21:48.872 --> 21:50.831
I think it's impressive
that an agent has

21:50.874 --> 21:52.572
finally gotten some
Bluetooth earbuds.

21:52.615 --> 21:56.837
I'm asking you about
Director Vance's offer

21:56.880 --> 21:59.492
to him to take over the team.

21:59.535 --> 22:01.363
Am I on hold? Did you
put me on hold again?

22:01.407 --> 22:03.191
Uh...

22:03.234 --> 22:05.933
I don't know.
It'd be different.

22:05.976 --> 22:09.502
Which would be, uh, you know...

22:09.545 --> 22:11.199
different.

22:11.242 --> 22:13.854
Yes, it would.

22:13.897 --> 22:17.379
Is that a problem for you?

22:17.423 --> 22:20.382
Speaking of the opposite of
different, how great has it been

22:20.426 --> 22:22.210
having you down here
this week, huh?

22:22.253 --> 22:23.994
What do you say we get
the band back together,

22:24.038 --> 22:25.692
like, permanently,
you and me.

22:25.735 --> 22:29.173
Autopsy is
your bailiwick now, Jimmy.

22:29.217 --> 22:31.611
Yeah, but it could
be ours again.

22:31.654 --> 22:32.612
They put me on hold.

22:32.655 --> 22:34.178
How can we help you?

22:34.222 --> 22:35.789
We're still trying
to track down

22:35.832 --> 22:37.181
Bolton's mystery partner.

22:37.225 --> 22:39.183
I heard you found something
that might help.

22:39.227 --> 22:42.709
We think we may have found
a piece of the bomb's detonator.

22:42.752 --> 22:44.493
- If so, then Kasie
may be able

22:44.537 --> 22:47.496
to trace it back to this partner
for whom you're looking.

22:47.540 --> 22:51.413
She's also made some headway
on tracing the actual explosive.

22:51.457 --> 22:55.765
An Albanian cartel is selling it
on the black market.

22:57.288 --> 22:59.290
- Goes for $30
- K a gram.

23:00.291 --> 23:01.684
Even with his side gig,
Bolton couldn't afford

23:01.728 --> 23:02.859
half of what was in it.

23:02.903 --> 23:04.165
So, either

23:04.208 --> 23:06.254
the mystery partner
had deep pockets, or...

23:06.297 --> 23:08.125
Or he won the lottery.

23:08.169 --> 23:11.433
- Or he won the lottery, sure.
- No, I'm saying

23:11.477 --> 23:14.305
our dead petty officer
won the lottery.

23:14.349 --> 23:15.568
Really?

23:15.611 --> 23:17.787
Three times,
three different states

23:17.831 --> 23:20.442
over the past year,
over 100 grand total.

23:20.486 --> 23:23.619
I don't know anyone who's
won the lottery three times.

23:23.663 --> 23:26.709
I don't know anybody
who's won the lottery once.

23:26.753 --> 23:30.060
It's actually four times,
if you count an hour ago.

23:30.104 --> 23:33.194
Which is, you know, impossible.

23:34.848 --> 23:38.504
This place is way more
interesting than the FBI.

23:45.728 --> 23:49.079
When I found out how much
Bolton's suicide bomb cost,

23:49.123 --> 23:51.908
I realized he must have
another source of income.

23:51.952 --> 23:53.606
Domestic terrorism
ain't cheap.

23:53.649 --> 23:56.783
Mm-hmm. Then, an agent
found these in his gun safe.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.088
They're lottery picker cards

23:58.132 --> 24:00.439
from all over the
Eastern Seaboard.

24:00.482 --> 24:01.831
And lo and behold,

24:01.875 --> 24:03.485
these three match
actual wins.

24:03.529 --> 24:05.792
Four, if you count
an hour ago.

24:05.835 --> 24:08.359
Which is, you know,
impossible.

24:08.403 --> 24:10.492
Except Bolton was a hacker.

24:10.536 --> 24:13.103
You think he hacked the lottery
to pay for those bombs?

24:13.147 --> 24:16.498
If he did, this guy is like
the Frank Abagnale of hackers.

24:16.542 --> 24:18.369
Remember, Leo--
oh, he was cute--

24:18.413 --> 24:19.545
played him in <i>
Catch Me if You Can?</i>

24:19.588 --> 24:21.329
He was a doctor,
he was a lawyer...

24:21.372 --> 24:24.332
And I was in the FBI.
I know who Frank Abagnale is.

24:24.375 --> 24:27.030
Thing is, if Bolton
did hack the lottery,

24:27.074 --> 24:29.555
he wasn't the one
cashing in the winning tickets.

24:29.598 --> 24:32.035
He had someone else do
the pickups for him.

24:32.079 --> 24:35.212
I'm thinking that's the partner
you've been looking for.

24:35.256 --> 24:36.736
Her name's Lillian Beck.

24:36.779 --> 24:38.607
And if there's any more
bombings planned,

24:38.651 --> 24:40.261
I imagine she'd know
about them.

24:40.304 --> 24:44.178
Luckily for us,
she has some new winnings

24:44.221 --> 24:45.440
to cash in tomorrow.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.268
It's stakeout time, baby.

24:47.311 --> 24:48.748
Nice work.

24:52.099 --> 24:55.232
- Uh, I'm gonna need this.
- Mm-hmm.

24:55.276 --> 24:57.974
Just one more thing.

25:00.411 --> 25:02.239
A little birdie told me
that you preferred to try

25:02.283 --> 25:05.939
and negotiate with LeMere at
this particular point in time.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.420
That's not quite... I don't know what's

25:09.464 --> 25:11.553
going on with you here
or whatever,

25:11.597 --> 25:13.642
but let's get
one thing straight.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.818
If there's ever
a crazy assassin

25:15.862 --> 25:17.733
holding a sharp object
to my neck again,

25:17.777 --> 25:19.343
I'm gonna need you
to shoot first,

25:19.387 --> 25:21.911
ask questions later.

25:24.131 --> 25:27.526
If you can do that,
then we're good.

25:27.569 --> 25:28.570
We good?

25:28.614 --> 25:31.486
We're good.

25:31.530 --> 25:34.620
Good.

25:41.627 --> 25:44.064
What do you think makes someone

25:44.107 --> 25:46.893
become a suicide bomber?

25:46.936 --> 25:48.982
Well, I think
if you're angry enough,

25:49.025 --> 25:50.984
you can get talked into
just about anything.

25:51.027 --> 25:51.985
Sitrep.

25:52.028 --> 25:53.769
Got eyes on our suspect.

25:53.813 --> 25:56.685
- In line. About to cash a ticket.
- Copy.

25:56.729 --> 25:59.645
You're getting good at that.
"Sitrep. Copy."

25:59.688 --> 26:01.647
Thanks.

26:01.690 --> 26:02.952
Been practicing
in the mirror.

26:02.996 --> 26:04.171
It's so good that
it makes me not buy

26:04.214 --> 26:05.781
what you told Parker
in the bathroom.

26:05.825 --> 26:07.261
He told you about that?

26:07.304 --> 26:09.306
No.

26:10.090 --> 26:11.570
Okay, then, what,
were you, like,

26:11.613 --> 26:13.615
listening at the
bathroom door?

26:14.660 --> 26:16.139
Oh, my God, seriously.

26:16.183 --> 26:17.532
- Were you listening at the door?
- It doesn't matter.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.055
The point is,
is all that noise about

26:19.099 --> 26:21.362
you not wanting the big chair
because of the extra hours.

26:21.405 --> 26:22.798
Yeah, homie don't buy that.

26:22.842 --> 26:24.147
I can't believe it--
you're sitting there, like,

26:24.191 --> 26:25.540
just listening through
the bathroom door.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.759
Hey, don't change the subject.

26:26.802 --> 26:27.977
What subject?
That I don't want

26:28.021 --> 26:29.588
to be team leader
because I'm not Gibbs?

26:29.631 --> 26:31.067
No, you're not Gibbs.

26:31.111 --> 26:33.156
But you're Timothy freakin'
McGee, you're a cyber ninja.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.984
When people shoot you,
you keep on coming, man.

26:35.028 --> 26:37.160
Yeah, except it was Gibbs
who shot me.

26:37.204 --> 26:39.772
Okay? Twice.
He put two bullets through me.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.469
And you know what,
it saved my life.

26:41.512 --> 26:44.341
It hurt like hell getting shot,
but I can't imagine

26:44.385 --> 26:46.517
what it felt like
pulling that trigger.

26:46.561 --> 26:49.346
I mean, who could do that?
Could I do that?

26:49.390 --> 26:52.828
For someone so smart,
you can be so dumb.

26:52.872 --> 26:55.048
- Thanks, that's helpful.
- Tim, the guy

26:55.091 --> 26:56.702
who shouldn't be in charge
is the guy

26:56.745 --> 26:58.442
who's not even asking
the question.

26:59.182 --> 27:02.011
Doubt is not weakness,
it's a strength.

27:02.055 --> 27:03.839
A leader without doubt?

27:03.883 --> 27:05.754
Now, that's a guy
I'd be worried about.

27:05.798 --> 27:07.669
Look, Nick, my point is,
I don't want to be

27:07.713 --> 27:09.758
the guy that can pull
that trigger.

27:09.802 --> 27:11.412
Okay?

27:11.455 --> 27:13.153
If there's anything I've
learned from Gibbs,

27:13.196 --> 27:15.546
it's that this job is
all-consuming.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.157
It completely consumes you.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.246
You know what the guy
had to do to escape?

27:19.289 --> 27:20.726
He had to go to Alaska!

27:20.769 --> 27:22.728
Like, Alaska.

27:22.771 --> 27:24.643
I got a family, Nick.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.557
That can't be me.
I can't do that.

27:26.601 --> 27:28.734
It's that simple.

27:31.780 --> 27:34.000
Go ahead, tell me again
how dumb I am.

27:38.744 --> 27:41.050
Well, I have no complaints
about that.

27:43.792 --> 27:46.142
Only respect.

27:47.753 --> 27:49.058
Thanks, brother.

27:50.233 --> 27:51.626
Suspect coming out.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.889
Repeat, suspect coming out.

27:57.371 --> 28:01.941
Now, what do you say we go
and arrest some bad guys?

28:01.984 --> 28:04.247
Sounds pretty good to me.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.123
Guess what I just heard.
We just caught

28:10.166 --> 28:12.081
Bolton's mystery partner.

28:12.125 --> 28:14.257
- What are you doing?
- Leaving.

28:14.301 --> 28:17.304
Aren't we gonna sterilize
the bone saw later?

28:17.347 --> 28:19.132
I remember that one time... Jimmy...

28:19.175 --> 28:23.397
Jimmy, it is time for me
to retake my rightful place

28:23.440 --> 28:26.313
as NCIS historian.

28:26.356 --> 28:28.141
Wait. Don't go.

28:28.184 --> 28:30.012
Stop, stop, stop.

28:32.014 --> 28:33.537
Is everything all right?

28:33.581 --> 28:36.018
Is everything...?

28:36.062 --> 28:39.674
No, no, it's not.
It's not at all.

28:39.718 --> 28:42.329
I've had just about enough
of people leaving this year.

28:42.372 --> 28:44.200
Just one after another.

28:44.244 --> 28:46.289
Breena.

28:48.857 --> 28:51.817
And then Bishop
and now Gibbs.

28:51.860 --> 28:53.340
So you are gonna
come back in here.

28:53.383 --> 28:55.646
You're gonna lose the hat,
and together we are gonna

28:55.690 --> 28:58.258
go sterilize that damn
bone saw.

28:58.301 --> 28:59.868
Jimmy... Bone saw!

28:59.912 --> 29:01.000
Just...

29:04.743 --> 29:06.527
Jimmy,

29:06.570 --> 29:08.921
yesterday is over,

29:08.964 --> 29:12.228
sad as that may seem.

29:12.272 --> 29:16.667
But change is
the essence of life.

29:16.711 --> 29:20.410
I know that, Doctor, but...

29:20.454 --> 29:21.890
this feels like a death.

29:21.934 --> 29:24.719
I miss him, too.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.853
But Jethro isn't dead.

29:27.896 --> 29:29.855
From what I hear,
it sounds as if

29:29.898 --> 29:32.422
he's starting to
live life again.

29:32.466 --> 29:37.688
Possibly for the first time
since losing his family.

29:37.732 --> 29:41.083
If that is the case,

29:41.127 --> 29:45.784
I don't mourn his departure.
I'm grateful for it.

29:47.873 --> 29:50.832
Our pain...

29:50.876 --> 29:52.921
is a small price to pay

29:52.965 --> 29:55.794
for his peace.

30:00.146 --> 30:02.931
I'm sorry.

30:02.975 --> 30:07.153
That was beautiful, Doctor.
Really beautiful.

30:07.196 --> 30:09.720
I almost hate to
totally ruin the moment

30:09.764 --> 30:11.157
by giving you this.

30:11.200 --> 30:14.682
It's the results from
the detonator fragment

30:14.725 --> 30:15.814
you found in our victim.

30:15.857 --> 30:18.555
Uh-oh.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.081
You know, I'm-I'm missing
my nephew's

30:22.124 --> 30:23.430
first Little League game.

30:23.473 --> 30:25.911
Yeah, I'm-I'm really sorry
about that.

30:25.954 --> 30:27.956
Um, there just seems to be

30:28.000 --> 30:30.829
a little misunderstanding
somewhere.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.134
You think?

30:32.178 --> 30:34.180
I bought a lottery ticket.
I won.

30:34.223 --> 30:37.096
I don't know anything
about any terrorist attack.

30:37.139 --> 30:40.142
What's he doing?
Did I miss it?

30:40.186 --> 30:42.492
He is, uh, doing
the "play dumb."

30:42.536 --> 30:45.931
Oh. That's boring.
Gonna be here all day.

30:45.974 --> 30:48.847
- So am I free to go?
- Yeah.

30:48.890 --> 30:52.111
Uh, just, um, one more question.

30:52.154 --> 30:54.548
You want to die
by lethal injection,

30:54.591 --> 30:56.942
or spend the rest of your life
rotting in a jail cell

30:56.985 --> 30:57.943
that smells like soup?

30:57.986 --> 30:59.248
Excuse me?

30:59.292 --> 31:01.555
We know you're been
working with Bolton.

31:01.598 --> 31:04.297
We know you're trying to
recruit more suicide bombers.

31:04.340 --> 31:06.125
And we know that you
funded your operation

31:06.168 --> 31:07.474
by hacking the lottery.

31:07.517 --> 31:10.129
What we don't know is
death or soup?

31:10.172 --> 31:12.435
That is not the "play dumb."

31:12.479 --> 31:14.916
"I am going to jail
for accessory to murder."

31:14.960 --> 31:16.962
Say it with me. "I..."Look, I-I...

31:17.005 --> 31:18.964
"...am going to jail..."Okay, I was working--

31:19.007 --> 31:20.313
I was working with Bolton.

31:20.356 --> 31:22.619
"...for accessory to..."Will you stop that?!

31:22.663 --> 31:24.665
I'm trying to confess.

31:24.708 --> 31:27.711
Not to murder.
I didn't kill anyone, okay?

31:27.755 --> 31:29.670
Let's hear it.

31:29.713 --> 31:31.890
And by the way, you don't
have any nephews.

31:34.849 --> 31:38.897
I'm a back-end coder for
the East Coast Lottery Group.

31:38.940 --> 31:42.422
We handle the lottery
in 13 states.

31:42.465 --> 31:46.861
About six months ago,
I found a flaw in the system,

31:46.905 --> 31:49.298
a-a way to preselect
the winners.

31:49.342 --> 31:51.953
But I needed a real hacker
to do the heavy lifting.

31:51.997 --> 31:53.520
A hacker like Bolton.

31:53.563 --> 31:55.391
I found him online.
The guy's basically

31:55.435 --> 31:57.567
the Frank Abagnale
of hackers.

31:57.611 --> 31:59.526
I've heard. Go on.

31:59.569 --> 32:01.049
That's it.

32:01.093 --> 32:03.965
We didn't hack the lottery
to fund a terrorist attack.

32:04.009 --> 32:08.274
We hacked the lottery to...
t-to hack the lottery. Duh.

32:09.057 --> 32:10.929
That actually is
pretty believable.

32:10.972 --> 32:12.365
Hey. We've got a problem.

32:12.408 --> 32:13.932
Yeah, a big problem.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.977
Our entire case
might have just fallen apart.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.718
Kasie found traces
of polydioxanone

32:17.761 --> 32:19.198
on the detonator
fragment.

32:19.241 --> 32:21.591
Plus bupivacaine
in his tox screen.

32:21.635 --> 32:23.724
I literally didn't understand
a word you just said.

32:23.767 --> 32:25.247
Wait, who-whose tox screen?

32:25.291 --> 32:28.685
Bolton's. Listen, the detonator
was a pacemaker battery.

32:28.729 --> 32:31.645
Bupivacaine is a local
anesthetic, and-- here.

32:31.688 --> 32:36.345
Okay, and polydioxanone
is used in surgical stitches.

32:36.389 --> 32:37.520
Surgical?

32:37.564 --> 32:39.392
Yeah, Dr. Mallard and I
were wrong.

32:39.435 --> 32:41.394
Bolton didn't swallow a bomb.

32:41.437 --> 32:43.309
It was surgically
implanted.

32:43.352 --> 32:45.311
And if it was a part
of a routine procedure,

32:45.354 --> 32:47.008
it's possible
he didn't even know

32:47.052 --> 32:48.879
he had a bomb inside of him.

32:49.663 --> 32:53.536
So, if there wasn't
a terrorist attack,

32:53.580 --> 32:56.235
what were you
recruiting people for?

32:56.278 --> 33:00.761
I couldn't keep winning
the lottery myself, genius.

33:00.804 --> 33:03.764
Oh, so you needed cutouts
to pick up the money for you.

33:03.807 --> 33:05.896
And we already
had ten lined up.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.768
We were about to be rich.

33:07.811 --> 33:10.640
Bolton was planning
on retiring to Cabo.

33:10.684 --> 33:12.773
The last thing
he ever would have done

33:12.816 --> 33:14.383
is blow himself up.

33:14.427 --> 33:16.777
Then how the hell did he end up
a human grenade?

33:17.560 --> 33:21.042
Sorry, that's...
that's not my department.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.360
- I spoke to three of the
recruits who were hired

33:34.403 --> 33:36.318
to, uh, pick up
the next lottery tickets.

33:36.362 --> 33:38.581
They confirm
our suspect's story.

33:38.625 --> 33:41.758
So, if Bolton's big plan
was to hack the lotto,

33:41.802 --> 33:44.935
how did he end up with
a suicide bomb in him?

33:44.979 --> 33:47.155
We're right back
at square one.

33:47.199 --> 33:48.591
Yeah, you get used to it.

33:48.635 --> 33:50.245
It's got to have something
to do with his website.

33:50.289 --> 33:51.986
We should dig into
the other bad guys

33:52.030 --> 33:53.205
who have hired him.

33:53.248 --> 33:54.902
McGee's going through
the weblogs now.

33:54.945 --> 33:56.164
And check this out.

33:56.208 --> 33:58.471
Most of those bad-guy names
were encrypted.

33:58.514 --> 34:00.821
But one name did pop up
on a wire transfer,

34:00.864 --> 34:03.737
and you are gonna love it.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.957
I told you, I thought
he was the cable guy.

34:07.001 --> 34:08.611
That-That's all I know.

34:09.395 --> 34:11.919
Please don't take this
the wrong way,

34:11.962 --> 34:14.226
but you are totally lying.

34:14.269 --> 34:16.793
Right after Bolton
paid you a visit,

34:16.837 --> 34:21.233
you took out a reverse mortgage
on your house for 20 grand.

34:21.276 --> 34:24.192
I'm doing a renovation.

34:24.236 --> 34:27.413
One week later,
- that same $20
- K ended up

34:27.456 --> 34:30.677
in Bolton's e-commerce account
in the Caymans.

34:30.720 --> 34:33.723
It was a Caribbean-themed
renovation?

34:33.767 --> 34:35.464
Now, that's a horrible liar.

34:35.508 --> 34:37.988
Where did you get
the Albanian explosive?

34:38.032 --> 34:39.338
I don't know what that is.

34:39.381 --> 34:42.036
How did it end up inside
Petty Officer Bolton?

34:42.080 --> 34:43.516
I don't know what that means.

34:43.559 --> 34:46.780
We have proof
that you paid Bolton $20,000

34:46.823 --> 34:49.261
- to his offshore account.
- He said we wouldn't get caught.

34:49.304 --> 34:50.566
He said we wouldn't get caught!

34:50.610 --> 34:52.699
And you are going to tell me
what it was for.

34:52.742 --> 34:53.830
It was for Helen.

34:53.874 --> 34:55.441
Okay?

34:56.659 --> 34:57.965
Helen.

34:58.008 --> 34:59.967
The...

35:00.010 --> 35:02.274
woman you met at the bus stop?

35:03.797 --> 35:05.712
Keep talking.

35:07.279 --> 35:09.324
Everything I told you was true.

35:09.368 --> 35:12.066
Your petty officer
came over,

35:12.110 --> 35:13.502
said he was the cable guy.

35:13.546 --> 35:16.505
Then we had lemonade,
just like I said.

35:16.549 --> 35:18.028
And then...

35:18.072 --> 35:20.030
And then you told him
about Helen?

35:20.074 --> 35:23.164
It may have come up.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.906
When I saw her smile... Skip that part.

35:27.081 --> 35:29.736
He told me he might be able
to hack into a traffic cam

35:29.779 --> 35:31.825
by the bus stop
where Helen and me met

35:31.868 --> 35:33.783
and get a photo of her face.

35:33.827 --> 35:35.176
And then, you know,

35:35.220 --> 35:38.310
do some facial recognition.

35:38.353 --> 35:40.660
Well, that's creepy.

35:40.703 --> 35:44.142
It's not stalking if she gave me
her number already, is it?

35:44.185 --> 35:45.752
I'm gonna go out on a limb

35:45.795 --> 35:48.537
and say this guy is not
our criminal mastermind.

35:48.581 --> 35:49.973
He's got to be
connected somehow.

35:50.017 --> 35:52.672
Otherwise, why would Bolton have
an entire dossier...

35:52.715 --> 35:56.154
Whoa.

35:56.197 --> 35:57.285
What?

35:57.329 --> 35:59.157
Bolton has this guy's
medical records.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.376
Ever wonder why?

36:04.640 --> 36:06.947
Have you had
- any surgery recently?
No.

36:06.990 --> 36:08.992
Well, I mean, sort of.
- A week ago.
- Where?

36:09.036 --> 36:12.170
My doctor called and said that
my pacemaker battery was low.

36:12.213 --> 36:14.607
You just got that last year.
It doesn't run low that fast.

36:14.650 --> 36:16.217
It just took
an hour to swap out.

36:16.261 --> 36:17.392
It wasn't a big deal.

36:17.436 --> 36:19.002
It might actually be a big deal.

36:19.046 --> 36:20.308
Evacuate the building.

36:20.352 --> 36:21.962
- Call the bomb squad.
- Wait, what?

36:22.005 --> 36:23.181
No, hold on.

36:23.224 --> 36:24.660
I don't understand.
What is happening?

36:24.704 --> 36:26.662
It's got to be connected
to one of your cases.

36:26.706 --> 36:28.664
You're a stenographer, right?
What's your next case?

36:28.708 --> 36:30.579
I can't tell you.
I'm a Silverstar-ranked...

36:30.623 --> 36:33.408
Look, I got your damn
subpoena approved, okay?

36:33.452 --> 36:35.671
They just haven't sent
the actual records yet.

36:35.715 --> 36:37.499
Now focus.
What's your next case?

36:37.543 --> 36:39.719
Okay, okay, there's
this guy...

36:39.762 --> 36:41.024
Come on, come on.

36:41.068 --> 36:43.026
Here they come,
Mr. Palmer. Look sharp.

36:43.070 --> 36:44.332
McGee filled us in.

36:44.376 --> 36:45.855
We are prepping for X-ray.

36:45.899 --> 36:47.944
We're gonna take a look
inside you.

36:47.988 --> 36:50.730
- This is not happening.
- You're gonna be okay.

36:50.773 --> 36:52.949
- Just lie down.
- I'm not gonna be okay,

36:52.993 --> 36:54.864
- according to your boss.
- You're our boss?

36:54.908 --> 36:57.389
I've been turned into a walking
time bomb by Tony Soprano.

36:57.432 --> 36:59.826
Apparently, Royman here
just got assigned a case

36:59.869 --> 37:03.046
against a pretty scary-sounding
Mafia kingpin.

37:03.090 --> 37:05.005
Four of the witnesses against
him have already disappeared,

37:05.048 --> 37:07.094
and the last one was moved
into witness protection.

37:07.137 --> 37:08.313
All right, hold your breath.

37:10.097 --> 37:12.317
He's in a hidden location--
tightest security possible.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.580
I'm supposed to record
his deposition tomorrow,

37:14.623 --> 37:16.321
and then I guess I blow up?

37:16.364 --> 37:18.105
Was that the freaking plan?

37:18.148 --> 37:19.454
There's the atrial lead.

37:19.498 --> 37:21.195
There's the
pulse generator.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.936
And something else.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.374
Based on density,
I would say

37:26.418 --> 37:28.246
that's our explosive.

37:28.289 --> 37:29.899
Oh, my gobsmacker.

37:29.943 --> 37:32.119
I've been turned into
an exploding Trojan horse.

37:32.162 --> 37:34.774
Okay, everybody,
- get out of here.
- What, you're leaving?

37:34.817 --> 37:37.211
- No, no. I'll stay
until the bomb squad's

37:37.255 --> 37:38.473
med techs arrive.

37:38.517 --> 37:39.518
We don't have that much time.

37:39.561 --> 37:41.346
This protrusion tells me

37:41.389 --> 37:43.609
that the explosive is leaking.

37:43.652 --> 37:45.437
Just like
Petty Officer Bolton here.

37:47.308 --> 37:48.962
How much time does he have?

37:49.005 --> 37:50.398
A day? A minute?

37:50.442 --> 37:52.922
I mean, we have
to get it out now.

37:55.708 --> 37:57.579
Well, what are you
looking at me for?

37:57.623 --> 37:59.842
Your body, your call.

37:59.886 --> 38:02.367
Um... get it out!

38:03.193 --> 38:05.544
We're already prepped
for extraction. Light.

38:05.587 --> 38:08.242
CHG locked and loaded.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.070
Prepping the surgical site.

38:10.113 --> 38:13.378
- Administering 10cc's
local anesthetic.

38:13.421 --> 38:15.380
It's okay, buddy.

38:15.423 --> 38:17.947
Okay. Relax.

38:17.991 --> 38:20.385
Dr. Palmer, would you care
to do the honors?

38:20.428 --> 38:22.430
Uh...

38:22.474 --> 38:25.346
Oh, you might want
to remove the decoration.

38:25.390 --> 38:26.782
Right.

38:26.826 --> 38:28.828
Oh, look at that.
It's feeling better already.

38:31.613 --> 38:34.137
All right. Do me a favor.

38:34.181 --> 38:37.315
- Mm-hmm.
- Stay very still.

38:40.100 --> 38:42.145
<i>In D.C. yesterday,</i>

38:42.189 --> 38:44.365
a murder attempt
against the star witness

38:44.409 --> 38:48.848
in a Mafia kingpin's trial
was thwarted by agents at NCIS.

38:48.891 --> 38:52.808
Sources say that Besnik Toptani,
the notorious Albanian kingpin,

38:52.852 --> 38:54.984
choreographed an elaborate plot to kill...

38:56.377 --> 38:58.379
Toptani's people knew
Petty Officer Bolton

38:58.423 --> 39:00.555
from his "Geek Squad
for bad guys" website.

39:00.599 --> 39:02.165
They came up with
the Trojan horse idea

39:02.209 --> 39:04.994
and hired Bolton to hack
into Roy's medical records.

39:05.038 --> 39:06.953
But they only had one shot
at taking the witness out,

39:06.996 --> 39:10.435
so they decided to use Bolton
as a guinea pig for the surgery,

39:10.478 --> 39:13.220
but... test run didn't
go so well.

39:13.699 --> 39:15.701
He died before
they could blow him up.

39:15.744 --> 39:17.398
- So the Albanians
ditched the body,

39:17.442 --> 39:18.791
worked out the kinks,

39:18.834 --> 39:21.402
and then forced Roy's doctor
to try again on Roy.

39:21.446 --> 39:24.013
I'll spare you
the Frank Abagnale comparison,

39:24.057 --> 39:25.188
and I'll just say

39:25.232 --> 39:27.365
this is one for the books.

39:28.104 --> 39:30.368
Agent Knight, will you
excuse us a moment?

39:34.807 --> 39:36.374
Very nice work.

39:36.417 --> 39:38.593
Thank you.
You know, I, um...

39:38.637 --> 39:40.247
I jumped online this morning

39:40.290 --> 39:41.857
to try to get you
replacement tickets

39:41.901 --> 39:45.861
for that Simon and Garfunkel
concert that you missed.

39:45.905 --> 39:47.559
Oh, yeah?

39:47.602 --> 39:49.909
Turns out there is no Simon
and Garfunkel reunion tour.

39:49.952 --> 39:51.432
And there's not gonna be.

39:51.476 --> 39:53.434
I heard they hate each other.

39:54.304 --> 39:56.698
I'm more of a Bowie guy anyway.

39:57.699 --> 39:58.787
I see.

40:00.485 --> 40:02.008
I just wanted to see what

40:02.051 --> 40:04.402
a regular day
around here was like,

40:04.445 --> 40:06.621
and I was told
it might spook the locals

40:06.665 --> 40:10.016
if they thought
I had plans to stay.

40:10.059 --> 40:12.018
Wasn't my idea, actually.

40:12.061 --> 40:13.019
Whose was it?

40:14.368 --> 40:16.152
I'm gonna take that one
to my grave.

40:16.196 --> 40:17.763
Well...

40:18.590 --> 40:20.809
You want the job or not?

40:32.647 --> 40:34.127
We did one last visual exam.

40:34.170 --> 40:35.433
Everything's all clear.

40:35.476 --> 40:37.478
That was the third sweep
in 24 hours.

40:37.522 --> 40:40.394
With azidoazide,
better safe than sorry.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.440
So, spoke to the D.A.

40:42.483 --> 40:43.919
They're willing to drop
the hacking charge

40:43.963 --> 40:45.878
in exchange for
community service.

40:45.921 --> 40:47.096
How much?

40:48.489 --> 40:51.449
Well, what do you think?

40:52.319 --> 40:53.886
Still thinking.

40:53.929 --> 40:56.018
I know the feeling.

40:56.062 --> 40:57.803
500 hours?

40:57.846 --> 40:59.500
Either that or jail.

40:59.544 --> 41:01.154
Well, it's not like
I have other plans.

41:01.197 --> 41:02.460

41:03.809 --> 41:05.463

You never called me.

41:13.819 --> 41:16.125
I-I lost your number.

41:16.169 --> 41:17.475
It was five-five...

41:17.518 --> 41:20.303
Five-oh-one-six-two.

41:20.347 --> 41:21.653
Oh.

41:21.696 --> 41:23.219
Oh, I can't believe it.

41:23.263 --> 41:25.004
I guess he
has plans now.

41:25.047 --> 41:27.702
- I kept going to
the same bus stop,

41:27.746 --> 41:29.617
and you weren't there.

41:29.661 --> 41:31.489
Oh, well,
'cause I changed routes.

41:31.532 --> 41:32.968
You want to know what I think?

41:33.012 --> 41:35.231
Hey, look, guys,
