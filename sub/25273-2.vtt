<i>Previously on "Claws"...</i>

00:01.416 --> 00:02.982
She's here.

00:02.984 --> 00:05.060
Hello, lovely family.

00:05.062 --> 00:06.131
Try to help...

00:06.133 --> 00:07.787
Stay in your lane!

00:07.789 --> 00:10.790
We're not in Georgia anymore.

00:12.226 --> 00:14.493
Hello, ladies.

00:14.495 --> 00:16.896
Riva was toxic.

00:20.468 --> 00:23.736
Hey! Is this...
Is this happening right now?!

00:23.738 --> 00:25.504
Where did you get that?

00:25.506 --> 00:26.939
We will have wedding now.

00:26.941 --> 00:28.774
Hey, wait. We got to talk about this.

00:28.776 --> 00:31.277
I can't marry my boy.

00:33.247 --> 00:35.915
That is what control looks like.

00:35.917 --> 00:37.783
That looks like chaos to me.

00:37.785 --> 00:40.753
Jennifer's house belongs to you now.

00:40.755 --> 00:42.421
I will let you tell her.

00:42.423 --> 00:45.357
Oh, no, no, no. I-I can't do that.

01:17.959 --> 01:20.793
Mac and cheese is $3.99 a box?

01:20.795 --> 01:22.394
Are they out of their minds?

01:22.396 --> 01:24.230
Momma, no. You cannot mix that
shit with tuna for my kids

01:24.232 --> 01:25.564
every night and call it a meal.

01:25.566 --> 01:27.421
Well, not at these prices.

01:27.998 --> 01:29.335
Did you get my text?

01:29.337 --> 01:30.836
Oh, stop freaking.

01:30.838 --> 01:32.204
I'm here to give you a hand

01:32.206 --> 01:34.133
and help you get your marriage
back on track.

01:34.133 --> 01:35.199
Okay.

01:35.201 --> 01:36.801
And when I go to my Million Moms meeting,

01:36.803 --> 01:39.103
I promise I will not leave
my grandbabies in the car

01:39.105 --> 01:40.638
if it's over 100 degrees.

01:44.210 --> 01:45.343
Oh, hey, babe.

01:45.345 --> 01:46.878
Hey. Whatcha doing?

01:46.880 --> 01:48.479
Um...

01:48.481 --> 01:50.248
I need to talk to you for a second.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.216
Danita. Oh, my God!

01:52.218 --> 01:54.051
How are you, Ms. Thang?!

01:54.053 --> 01:55.019
My mom's here.

01:55.021 --> 01:57.255
It's Desna, Brenda.

01:57.257 --> 01:59.590
I've only told you that
like 8 million times.

01:59.592 --> 02:02.326
Oh, right. Desna.
How would I forget that?

02:02.328 --> 02:07.665
Look at that jumpsuit
and those cute nails.

02:07.667 --> 02:10.467
I'm coming in and getting mine
done just like that.

02:10.470 --> 02:11.870
Oh, you want some fried bologna?

02:11.872 --> 02:13.138
She... I'm good.

02:13.140 --> 02:14.373
She doesn't.

02:14.375 --> 02:16.074
Alright, what's going on?

02:16.076 --> 02:18.076
You don't usually do drive-bys
unless the shit hits the fan,

02:18.078 --> 02:20.112
and, ooh, it feels a little early

02:20.114 --> 02:21.847
for turds to be blowing around.

02:21.849 --> 02:23.849
Actually, it's not.

02:23.851 --> 02:25.784
It's about this house.

02:27.421 --> 02:28.954
We need to talk.

02:34.091 --> 02:36.161
Don't tell me that Bryce wants this house

02:36.163 --> 02:37.629
'cause it's Dixie Mafia booty.

02:37.631 --> 02:39.197
Everything is someone else's booty.

02:39.199 --> 02:41.466
Hey, Momma, don't you think
Judge Jeanine's on?

02:41.468 --> 02:42.467
I do.

02:42.469 --> 02:44.169
Oh, my God.

02:44.171 --> 02:45.170
There you go.

02:45.172 --> 02:47.339
Yeah. It's not Bryce.

02:47.341 --> 02:48.540
It's Zlata.

02:48.542 --> 02:49.975
Well, she don't own this house.

02:49.977 --> 02:51.276
Well, technically, she does

02:51.278 --> 02:53.645
'cause she took over
all Uncle Daddy's assets.

02:53.647 --> 02:55.647
Ohhh, that bitch.

02:56.951 --> 02:58.817
Well, what would she want
with this house, anyway?

02:58.819 --> 03:01.420
Essentially, I am her lieutenant now.

03:01.422 --> 03:03.188
Oh, no, ma'am, ma'am.

03:03.190 --> 03:04.189
Ma'am.

03:04.191 --> 03:05.524
She wants to give you my house.

03:05.526 --> 03:07.159
She thinks I should live like a boss.

03:07.161 --> 03:09.261
But you already got a gold
necklace that says "Boss" on it.

03:09.263 --> 03:10.829
- Jenn...
- Des!

03:10.831 --> 03:12.864
My kids... FYI, your godchildren...

03:12.866 --> 03:14.666
are finally in a good school district.

03:14.668 --> 03:16.101
- I know.
- They give them art supplies,

03:16.103 --> 03:17.970
they don't treat ketchup
like a vegetable...

03:17.972 --> 03:19.204
I know.

03:19.206 --> 03:21.206
Well, so, just tell her
this ain't gonna work.

03:21.208 --> 03:23.175
I saw her shoot her sister in the face.

03:23.177 --> 03:25.143
I'm not telling that woman jack.

03:26.452 --> 03:28.051
Well, then, <i>I'll</i> tell her.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.449
You know what she's trying to do.

03:30.451 --> 03:32.084
She's trying to pit us
against each other.

03:32.086 --> 03:33.285
I don't know what she's trying to do,

03:33.287 --> 03:35.087
but I know that Dean and my black ass

03:35.089 --> 03:36.521
is coming up in this house.

03:36.523 --> 03:38.290
And we gon' live like some
boogie-down Brady Bunch?

03:38.292 --> 03:39.624
I guess.

03:39.626 --> 03:42.527
It's either that or get got.

03:42.529 --> 03:44.196
O...?

03:44.198 --> 03:45.230
O....

03:47.735 --> 03:49.368
I'm out.

03:49.370 --> 03:51.103
Tell you something, boys,
I don't know how much longer

03:51.105 --> 03:52.471
I can deal with being broke.

03:52.473 --> 03:54.840
Ruval needs to re-assess
this whole situation.

03:54.842 --> 03:57.642
Two weeks with that broad?
That's an eternity.

03:57.644 --> 03:59.244
I mean, in 24 hours, she, what...

03:59.246 --> 04:01.780
she murdered her sister and made
my baby boy here marry a commie.

04:01.782 --> 04:03.548
Well, maybe we can put
some pressure on them...

04:03.550 --> 04:04.883
you know, speed it up.

04:04.885 --> 04:06.184
Oh, Haitians don't feel pressure.

04:06.186 --> 04:07.786
Them Russkies took everything we got.

04:07.788 --> 04:08.887
We got to do something.

04:08.889 --> 04:10.789
Look, I hear you, Uncle Daddy,

04:10.791 --> 04:12.724
but we got to be smart about this.

04:12.726 --> 04:14.326
Zlata got armed guards.

04:14.328 --> 04:15.894
Plus, little Olga told me she got people

04:15.896 --> 04:17.661
all the way up in the Gremlin.

04:17.664 --> 04:19.096
It's the Kremlin, genius.

04:19.099 --> 04:20.932
Potato, tomato. You got to listen up.

04:20.934 --> 04:22.901
We got to be smart
before she take us down.

04:22.903 --> 04:24.636
Yeah, she can't take us down
much lower than this.

04:24.638 --> 04:27.305
We're driving a station wagon
like a bunch of Indigo Girls.

04:27.307 --> 04:30.108
Well, hey, what if we get some,
uh, some intel on her?

04:30.110 --> 04:32.010
You know, figure out what makes her tick.

04:32.012 --> 04:33.979
Intel? I ain't looking to spy.

04:33.981 --> 04:36.381
I want to get some automatics
and blow her freaking head off.

04:36.383 --> 04:38.817
No, no, Uncle Daddy, look,
w-we do a little recon,

04:38.819 --> 04:40.619
plant a bug, hand it over to Chip...

04:40.621 --> 04:43.155
or shit, Ruval... then we can
get out of this mess.

04:43.157 --> 04:45.323
Yeah? How we finna do that?

04:45.325 --> 04:46.458
You finna work.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.427
You ain't up in the big house
for nothing!

04:48.429 --> 04:50.228
Huh? Up top, Uncle Daddy.

04:53.133 --> 04:54.633
I'll get you in the car.

04:54.635 --> 04:56.334
So, I've been doing my research,

04:56.336 --> 05:00.072
and you gentlemen need dancer
names that will make women wet.

05:00.074 --> 05:04.176
Brad and Jeff? I'm simply not moist.

05:04.178 --> 05:06.878
They should highlight
your skills, you know?

05:06.880 --> 05:10.148
Brad, since you can grind
like nobody's business,

05:10.150 --> 05:13.685
I should like to name you after
my great-uncle's first film.

05:13.687 --> 05:14.920
Sweetback!

05:14.922 --> 05:17.322
Wait, Melvin Van Peebles is your uncle?

05:17.324 --> 05:18.390
Once removed.

05:18.392 --> 05:20.759
And, Jeff, on account of that anaconda,

05:20.761 --> 05:24.663
I should like to call you Double XL.

05:24.665 --> 05:25.730
Hey, holla!

05:28.202 --> 05:29.935
Don't let it go to your head.

05:32.272 --> 05:33.472
Wake up!

05:36.710 --> 05:38.655
Everything okay?

05:39.113 --> 05:42.280
Yeah, just not in the mood
for dancer diaries.

05:42.282 --> 05:43.535
That's all.

05:44.251 --> 05:45.650
So, um...

05:45.652 --> 05:48.587
you tell Desna about that bun
baking in your microwave?

05:48.589 --> 05:49.888
Shh.

05:52.126 --> 05:54.421
Nah, I haven't told her yet.

05:54.928 --> 05:57.429
Why do we have to tell Desna everything?

05:57.431 --> 05:59.531
She ain't Mother Teresa.

05:59.533 --> 06:03.568
I mean, don't you get tired of
her controlling our every move?

06:03.570 --> 06:04.736
Yeah.

06:04.738 --> 06:05.971
I mean, she's the reason

06:05.973 --> 06:07.706
Arlene and I ain't together anymore,

06:07.708 --> 06:09.508
but Dean is her brother.

06:09.510 --> 06:11.438
It's bound to get out.

06:11.712 --> 06:13.211
I'd rather slit my wrists

06:13.213 --> 06:16.014
than tell Desna
her brother got me pregnant.

06:16.016 --> 06:19.279
Well, Desna warned you
about falling on Dean's dick.

06:19.820 --> 06:21.453
You got to tell her.

06:23.824 --> 06:25.790
Trust me on that.

06:27.594 --> 06:31.396
First, you cheat on the father
of one of your babies,

06:31.398 --> 06:35.467
and now you're letting Dashica
and Davante take your house?

06:35.469 --> 06:36.935
Momma! God!

06:36.937 --> 06:38.703
Keep that shit to yourself.

06:38.705 --> 06:40.972
I asked you to come here so that
you could be supportive.

06:40.974 --> 06:42.974
Well, I <i> am</i> supporting you,
but this ain't right.

06:42.976 --> 06:45.510
Who is this commie skank, anyway?

06:45.512 --> 06:46.711
Hey!

06:46.713 --> 06:49.047
You are a Husser.

06:49.049 --> 06:51.416
You don't take orders from the KGB.

06:51.418 --> 06:52.350
Nanna!

06:52.352 --> 06:54.719
Oh, my goodness, sugarplums!

06:54.721 --> 06:56.821
Oh, my goodness! Ooh!

06:56.823 --> 06:58.790
Go on and run upstairs
and wait on Meemaw.

06:58.792 --> 06:59.824
"Nanna."

06:59.826 --> 07:01.126
Daddy loves y'all.

07:01.128 --> 07:02.627
Hey.

07:02.629 --> 07:03.795
Brenda.

07:03.797 --> 07:05.530
Bryce-y boo.

07:05.532 --> 07:08.800
Look, I need you to come home
and save your wife.

07:08.802 --> 07:12.003
A little extracurricular banging
never hurt a marriage.

07:12.005 --> 07:14.806
Just ask my three husbands.

07:16.076 --> 07:17.609
I said I was so sorry.

07:17.611 --> 07:19.244
Yeah, well, you should've thought of that

07:19.246 --> 07:21.446
before you slept
with the rabbi at the plaza.

07:21.448 --> 07:23.048
Wait, a rabbi? You slept with a Jew?

07:23.050 --> 07:24.583
That's not the point.

07:24.585 --> 07:28.286
Baby, I just feel like maybe
we could go to counseling or...

07:28.288 --> 07:29.788
we could even talk to a priest.

07:29.790 --> 07:31.756
That's a good idea. God can help.

07:31.758 --> 07:33.225
- Momma.
- Yeah.

07:33.227 --> 07:35.794
Can he help me forget
the rimjob you gave Hank?

07:35.796 --> 07:36.928
What are you talking about?

07:36.930 --> 07:38.496
Zlata showed me a video.

07:38.498 --> 07:39.693
No, she didn't.

07:41.001 --> 07:42.434
He cries when he comes.

07:44.304 --> 07:46.338
I guess she did.

07:46.340 --> 07:47.305
Yes, she did.

07:47.307 --> 07:49.574
L... Baby, listen. It was a while ago.

07:49.576 --> 07:52.410
And I don't know how many more
times I can say I'm sorry.

07:52.412 --> 07:54.446
Yeah, you know what? You <i> are</i> sorry!

07:54.448 --> 07:57.382
You're a sorry piece of shit!

07:57.384 --> 07:59.351
Every time you wonder why
your life went to hell,

07:59.353 --> 08:01.298
why don't you look in the mirror?

08:01.989 --> 08:04.189
<i>You</i> did this, Jennifer.

08:04.191 --> 08:05.290
You.

08:14.101 --> 08:17.602
So, um, it's a little slow midweek,

08:17.604 --> 08:20.238
until the pillbillies
get their government checks.

08:20.240 --> 08:23.695
I think your guards are
scaring away the foot traffic.

08:24.811 --> 08:26.678
They cause more pain.

08:26.680 --> 08:27.712
That's good.

08:27.714 --> 08:29.648
Really good.

08:35.621 --> 08:37.188
- Kenneth.
- I'm sorry.

08:37.190 --> 08:38.657
I got it. I got it.

08:45.766 --> 08:49.601
We work with the, uh, best
pharmaceutical sales reps.

08:49.603 --> 08:52.537
I mean, no one beats the deals
we get, right?

08:52.539 --> 08:53.571
Yes.

08:55.909 --> 08:58.063
Uh, that's my office.

08:58.445 --> 09:02.213
I just had it saged
and, uh, I got crystals.

09:02.215 --> 09:03.315
Got some Buddhas.

09:03.317 --> 09:04.549
T-That skeleton is...

09:04.551 --> 09:06.618
it's from, uh... We need privacy.

09:07.888 --> 09:08.987
Go.

09:11.291 --> 09:14.359
Is, um, everything okay, Zlata?

09:15.595 --> 09:18.063
In two weeks, we open new clinic.

09:18.065 --> 09:20.231
In five months, four more.

09:20.233 --> 09:23.568
We need to keep up foot traffic... ASPA.

09:23.570 --> 09:27.138
Okay, we will hit our target numbers.

09:27.140 --> 09:29.207
I can promise you that.

09:29.209 --> 09:31.576
Did you know that black women

09:31.578 --> 09:35.947
are largest-growing
entrepreneurs in the country?

09:35.949 --> 09:37.949
No, I didn't.

09:39.386 --> 09:42.053
But they don't get the loans
white men do.

09:42.055 --> 09:43.650
DO you know why?

09:44.057 --> 09:47.726
Because men sleep on women.

09:47.728 --> 09:49.227
They count us out.

09:49.229 --> 09:50.995
But I don't count us out.

09:50.997 --> 09:54.199
I see how you inspire your girls.

09:54.201 --> 09:56.735
I see how you care for your brother,

09:56.737 --> 09:59.137
and you get stuff done.

09:59.139 --> 10:03.007
You are a GOAT, Desna.

10:03.009 --> 10:04.976
You get our numbers up.

10:08.215 --> 10:09.314
I'm a GOAT.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.181
News flash.

10:17.183 --> 10:19.417
Zlata is putting pressure on us

10:19.419 --> 10:21.519
to get the traffic up down at the clinic.

10:21.521 --> 10:24.322
Or what? She'll put a cap in our ass?

10:24.324 --> 10:27.325
I love it when what you say and
how you look don't go together.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.605
Well, I'm not putting on
that pill costume again.

10:29.607 --> 10:30.795
That thing gave me vertigo.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.764
Yeah, that Lycra suit I had to
wear broke out my coochie.

10:33.766 --> 10:36.033
Pol, you are crazy.

10:36.035 --> 10:37.502
- It did!
- Unh-unh.

10:37.504 --> 10:39.170
What's really crazy
is this Russian renegade

10:39.172 --> 10:40.438
we got running around.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.173
Not only does she give you my house,

10:42.175 --> 10:44.909
she showed Bryce a video
of me giving Hank a rimjob.

10:45.845 --> 10:47.512
- You lying.
- I would not lie.

10:47.514 --> 10:51.582
Y'all, she is the definition
of a classic psychopath.

10:51.584 --> 10:55.820
She displays an inherent lack
of empathy, extreme narcissism,

10:55.822 --> 10:57.889
and no evidence of actual human emotion.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.624
- We are in trouble, y'all.
- I'm with Polly.

10:59.626 --> 11:02.059
Not only is she trying to pit us
against each other,

11:02.061 --> 11:03.694
babe, she's trying
to destroy my marriage.

11:03.696 --> 11:05.830
What she's trying to do
is strip the Hussers

11:05.832 --> 11:07.498
of all their dignity.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.001
What <i> I'm</i> trying to do is get us
on the other side of this

11:10.003 --> 11:12.136
before she ruins everything
we worked for.

11:12.138 --> 11:14.138
Oh, yeah, God forbid she wreck
this field of dreams.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.239
Oh! Pfft!

11:15.241 --> 11:17.642
Well, we are in the weeds now,

11:17.644 --> 11:19.810
so ideas... go.

11:19.812 --> 11:21.414
Uh...

11:22.015 --> 11:24.081
Hire a marketing person
and put up billboards.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.082
- Nice.
- Yeah.

11:25.084 --> 11:26.317
That stuff never works.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.152
Shanghai, cat got your tongue?

11:28.154 --> 11:29.487
Come on. Ideas.

11:29.489 --> 11:30.988
I'm pregnant.

11:30.990 --> 11:33.224
- What did you say?
- With Dean's baby.

11:36.462 --> 11:37.762
Run. Run!

11:54.514 --> 11:58.649
I cannot believe your mixed ass
wasn't on the pill!

11:58.651 --> 12:00.985
Listen, I was, but it made my feet swell

12:00.987 --> 12:02.286
and I couldn't put my heels on!

12:02.288 --> 12:04.488
Then why didn't you jimmy up, Virginia?

12:04.490 --> 12:06.835
They ran out of Magnums!

12:07.327 --> 12:10.294
So y'all was riding bareback?

12:10.296 --> 12:12.597
You could've gave my brother anything!

12:12.599 --> 12:13.998
Herpes or AIDS or...

12:14.000 --> 12:15.933
I promise you, I am clean.

12:15.935 --> 12:17.969
Bitch, you was giving happy endings

12:17.971 --> 12:19.570
behind the Steak 'n Shake!

12:19.572 --> 12:21.372
Your little ass is a lot of things,

12:21.374 --> 12:23.374
but clean ain't one of them.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.743
I cannot believe you did this to Dean.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.078
I'm sorry!

12:27.080 --> 12:29.413
I can't believe
you let him do this to you!

12:29.415 --> 12:32.149
Listen, we... we are going to
take care of it, okay?

12:32.151 --> 12:34.352
We found a really nice
abortion clinic in Sarasota.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.387
- What?!
- It's no big deal.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.122
Yes, it is!

12:38.124 --> 12:40.958
Virginia, do you know
what this is gon' do to Dean?

12:40.960 --> 12:42.960
He is the one that made the appointment!

12:42.962 --> 12:45.563
I don't give a damn, Virginia!

12:47.734 --> 12:50.501
I asked your ass to do <i> one</i> thing,

12:50.503 --> 12:53.137
and that was to stay away
from my brother.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.540
You couldn't even do that.

12:56.542 --> 12:57.842
I love him, Des.

12:57.844 --> 12:59.243
Shit.

13:00.246 --> 13:02.446
We just made a mistake!

13:09.255 --> 13:10.588
Hey.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.590
Um...

13:12.592 --> 13:15.226
You know, you don't have to take
<i>everything</i> to Jenn's house.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.862
Virginia already told me she told you.

13:17.864 --> 13:20.765
Why didn't <i> you</i> tell me, Dean? Huh?

13:20.767 --> 13:22.166
Look at me!

13:22.168 --> 13:24.869
H-How could you keep
something like this from me?

13:24.871 --> 13:26.170
We tell each other everything!

13:26.172 --> 13:27.605
Uh, n-no, we don't.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.040
W-W-When are you gonna explain
what's going on

13:29.042 --> 13:30.841
with the Russian people you work for?

13:30.843 --> 13:32.910
Oh, my God. D...

13:32.912 --> 13:34.505
Dean, it's not the...

13:35.548 --> 13:36.681
Dean.

13:36.683 --> 13:38.883
It is complicated, okay?

13:38.885 --> 13:40.785
But it is not the same thing as this.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.820
Yes, it is! S-Secrets are secrets, Desna.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.089
And you promised
you were always gonna be honest.

13:45.091 --> 13:46.726
I <i> am!</i>

13:47.360 --> 13:51.062
Okay, Dean, the Russians took
over the salon and the clinic.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.431
That's all. Okay?

13:53.433 --> 13:57.134
I want to know that you know
what you're doing on this.

13:57.136 --> 13:58.863
We're not ready to have a kid.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.605
Is it because of genetics, Dean?

14:01.607 --> 14:03.240
'Cause you have autism?
You'll pass it on?

14:03.242 --> 14:05.509
- Because it doesn't mean that.
- It's not about that!

14:05.511 --> 14:08.145
Okay, you know I got a good job now.

14:08.147 --> 14:10.114
I'm making money, Dean. I can help you...

14:10.116 --> 14:11.649
We don't want it!

14:12.885 --> 14:14.385
I know, Dean,

14:14.387 --> 14:16.520
but I just want to make sure
you thought this through.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.588
I am not dumb!

14:17.590 --> 14:18.556
I didn't say that.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.324
This is our decision, Desna!

14:20.326 --> 14:21.892
Y-You stay out of it!

14:21.894 --> 14:23.327
Dean...

14:23.329 --> 14:24.662
Dean!

14:25.998 --> 14:27.064
Damn it.

14:37.443 --> 14:38.976
<i>Here at Plaque Don't Crack,</i>

14:38.978 --> 14:41.906
<i>we make it our mission
to get the blaaack...</i>

14:43.049 --> 14:44.749
<i>off your stack!</i>

14:54.861 --> 14:56.460
Hey, girl. Hey.

14:56.462 --> 14:57.728
- You okay?
- Yeah.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.197
Just tired, is all.

15:00.199 --> 15:01.699
Was up all night with Momma,

15:01.701 --> 15:04.401
trying to get the house ready
for Dean and Desna.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.303
I can't stop thinking about
what you said about Zlata.

15:06.305 --> 15:08.572
Yeah, we got to keep an eye
on that psychopath.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.374
- Right.
- Don't you worry.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.276
There's a silver lining to everything.

15:12.278 --> 15:14.578
For example, the silver lining for me

15:14.580 --> 15:17.414
is that Desna's house is now free,

15:17.416 --> 15:19.583
and I might be able to
pop one off in private.

15:19.585 --> 15:23.320
And my silver lining is now that
Dean's gonna be living there,

15:23.322 --> 15:25.523
we can bang in your pool all the time.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.224
Ew! Sounds like fun.

15:27.226 --> 15:29.894
Don't worry. You'll find
your silver lining, girl.

15:30.863 --> 15:34.265
Um... can y'all actually start
Mrs. Dobson's silk wrap?

15:34.267 --> 15:35.466
I'ma be there in like two minutes.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.468
- Alright.
- Sure, girl. Mm-hmm.

15:55.087 --> 15:56.253
Ugh.

16:02.195 --> 16:05.830
So, uh, you want to play a video game?

16:08.267 --> 16:09.400
What do you got?

16:09.402 --> 16:11.468
"Assassin's Creed" or, uh...

16:11.470 --> 16:13.470
What you know about "Assassin's Creed"?

16:13.472 --> 16:16.774
I know I'm about to whup your ass.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.276
Huh? Yeah, okay.

16:19.278 --> 16:20.744
Shit.

16:20.746 --> 16:22.880
He wants the tits.

16:22.882 --> 16:25.716
I will be right back.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.285
Okay.

16:43.069 --> 16:45.035
I know it's a bold idea,

16:45.037 --> 16:48.272
but a commercial might be
just what we need.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.975
A commercial for illegal business?

16:52.078 --> 16:53.477
I don't like it, Desna.

16:53.479 --> 16:56.447
Look, we advertise
the pain-management part.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.550
I mean, that's a legit pursuit.

16:59.552 --> 17:03.254
Look, Russians are not like
your people, Desna.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.923
We disrupt quietly.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.392
Oh!

17:08.394 --> 17:10.761
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:10.762 --> 17:11.929
Don't shoot.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.364
Easy, now. Look.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.465
I'm just picking up a copy of the book.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.734
- Audiobook for baby bo'.
- Shh.

17:17.737 --> 17:21.672
You don't come into this office
without invitation.

17:21.674 --> 17:22.806
Clear?

17:22.808 --> 17:24.275
Crystal.

17:24.277 --> 17:27.176
Look, we're family now, right? You know?

17:27.179 --> 17:28.512
Sit down.

17:29.682 --> 17:33.884
And you, my friend,
go and shoot your commercial.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.019
Prove me wrong.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.320
Are you sure?

17:36.322 --> 17:38.422
I don't micromanage.

17:38.424 --> 17:40.591
But it better be good.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.426
You know how I feel about failure.

17:50.230 --> 17:52.096
Looking good, guys.

17:52.098 --> 17:53.731
Here you go, ma'am.

17:55.835 --> 17:59.737
I mean, don't you ever wish
you could press Rewind on life?

17:59.739 --> 18:03.241
Yeah... so we can do it all over again.

18:03.243 --> 18:04.809
That's not what I meant.

18:05.234 --> 18:07.245
Ever since we hooked up,
my life's gone to shit.

18:07.247 --> 18:09.547
Well, God doesn't want us to be unhappy.

18:10.617 --> 18:12.583
Was that on a bumper sticker
or something?

18:14.187 --> 18:16.120
I'm married.

18:16.122 --> 18:17.288
Okay?

18:17.290 --> 18:19.257
I got to put my life back together.

18:19.259 --> 18:21.259
My family means everything to me.

18:24.897 --> 18:26.063
Okay?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.533
Well, at least dance with me.

18:28.535 --> 18:30.378
Have you heard a word I said?

18:30.380 --> 18:32.058
Oh, we're just friends...
I get it, alright.

18:32.060 --> 18:34.826
But remember that square dancing
competition we were gonna enter?

18:34.828 --> 18:36.068
It's this Friday.

18:36.710 --> 18:39.911
Come on. It'll at least
make you smile again.

18:39.913 --> 18:41.746
- It won't.
- It will.

18:41.748 --> 18:45.516
I might not be able to work
on the Sabbath, but, uh,

18:45.518 --> 18:48.486
they can't stop me from dancing.

18:49.456 --> 18:50.538
Huh?

18:53.760 --> 19:00.565
So, Roller, what job
might be interesting for you?

19:07.374 --> 19:09.707
Well, I've always been good with numbers.

19:09.709 --> 19:11.275
Numbers?

19:12.145 --> 19:14.946
And Desna.

19:14.948 --> 19:16.280
That's true.

19:17.751 --> 19:21.018
She does have that effect on people.

19:21.588 --> 19:22.854
Doesn't she?

19:32.213 --> 19:34.713
Here we are.

19:36.584 --> 19:37.916
Okay.

19:37.918 --> 19:39.451
Virginia, where's your protection?

19:39.453 --> 19:41.019
I'm good. I got my flats on.

19:42.289 --> 19:44.022
Alright. Let's do this.

19:50.664 --> 19:52.965
Gird your loins!

20:02.676 --> 20:05.010
God sees everything!

20:05.012 --> 20:07.913
Yeah, can he see this?

20:09.783 --> 20:13.719
You will burn in hell
as your baby gets its wings!

20:13.721 --> 20:15.621
I was an unwanted baby, and it sucks!

20:15.623 --> 20:17.189
Go on, get married!

20:17.191 --> 20:19.725
Me and my sister got tossed
around from family to family,

20:19.727 --> 20:21.126
and nobody wanted us!

20:21.128 --> 20:24.196
W-We lived on food stamps and...
and we were abused,

20:24.198 --> 20:26.632
and not one of you was around to help us!

20:26.634 --> 20:28.133
You only care about babies in the womb.

20:28.135 --> 20:30.335
You don't care about them
when they... when they come out.

20:30.337 --> 20:33.505
If you did, you'd be fighting to
end human trafficking in Libya!

20:33.507 --> 20:34.673
And Sarasota!

20:40.114 --> 20:41.914
I can't do a commercial
for an illegal clinic.

20:41.916 --> 20:43.382
I'm a father now.

20:43.384 --> 20:47.019
Okay, I may have made it <i> sound</i>
like a request,

20:47.021 --> 20:48.387
but it's not, Kenneth.

20:48.389 --> 20:50.188
It's an order.
You're doing the commercial.

20:50.190 --> 20:52.424
- I'm not...
- So cut down on the fried foods,

20:52.426 --> 20:54.826
'cause HD sees right into your pores.

20:54.828 --> 20:56.061
It's true.

20:56.063 --> 20:58.697
But that's not possible! I use a serum!

20:59.700 --> 21:01.600
Um, hey, Des?

21:01.602 --> 21:03.235
I was wondering, um,

21:03.237 --> 21:05.904
could Marnie and I move into your house

21:05.906 --> 21:07.439
now that ♪ you're moving on up? ♪

21:07.441 --> 21:09.875
Of course you can. You know
I don't care about that.

21:09.877 --> 21:11.243
- Oh, thank you!
- Yeah.

21:11.245 --> 21:13.078
I just want to get back down to the salon

21:13.080 --> 21:15.347
so we can pitch some of these
commercial ideas with the girls.

21:15.349 --> 21:17.616
Yeah, but it's just gonna be
you and me and Jenn.

21:17.618 --> 21:19.017
Why?

21:19.019 --> 21:21.687
Well, Quiet Ann and Virginia
are at the... thing.

21:21.689 --> 21:23.822
The thing? That was today?

21:23.824 --> 21:25.724
Well, how come nobody said nothing?

21:25.726 --> 21:28.060
And they let Quiet Ann go and not me?

21:28.062 --> 21:30.664
I don't know, Desna. She's quiet
and you're judgy-judgy.

21:30.666 --> 21:31.704
Wow.

21:31.706 --> 21:34.333
I mean, you're super pretty, though.

21:34.335 --> 21:35.500
- Wow.
- You are.

21:35.502 --> 21:39.805
And, girl, you got
a body-oddy-oddy to die for!

21:46.213 --> 21:48.046
Thanks for standing with me today.

21:48.048 --> 21:50.582
Oh, yeah. Women... Women have
the right to choose.

21:50.584 --> 21:52.351
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:52.353 --> 21:53.418
You're right.

21:55.656 --> 21:58.323
I-I'm... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go across the street

21:58.325 --> 22:00.892
and get pencils from the art store.

22:00.894 --> 22:03.061
- Okay.
- Oh. Sorry.

22:09.737 --> 22:10.902
Okay.

22:10.904 --> 22:11.928
Be careful.

22:11.930 --> 22:13.338
Bye.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.218
Hey.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.377
You okay?

22:34.554 --> 22:36.321
Yeah. I'm good.

22:40.801 --> 22:42.334
This is just hard.

22:45.539 --> 22:47.339
Um...

22:47.341 --> 22:49.408
What are they saying about me
at the salon?

22:51.278 --> 22:53.111
This bitch is having an abortion.

22:53.113 --> 22:55.914
Girl, she'll be fine. I had two.
I didn't think twice about it.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.215
At least she can get one.

22:57.217 --> 22:59.418
Back in Texas, they were illegal.

22:59.420 --> 23:02.254
I had to go to that nice lady
in the deli for mine.

23:02.256 --> 23:05.223
Oh, my Lord. You are all going to hell.

23:05.225 --> 23:07.859
Where's my dad going?
He raped my babysitter.

23:07.861 --> 23:09.261
Thank God <i>she</i> could have one.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.096
Polly, you never told us that.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.564
You never asked.

23:12.566 --> 23:14.266
Look, I think women should have
the right to choose,

23:14.268 --> 23:16.201
but some need to choose a condom.

23:16.203 --> 23:17.669
I shouldn't have to pay for it.

23:17.671 --> 23:19.204
You're not paying for anything.

23:19.206 --> 23:21.339
My tax dollars are.

23:21.341 --> 23:23.175
That's some alt-right bullshit.

23:23.177 --> 23:25.277
Well, at least these women can have kids.

23:25.279 --> 23:27.279
It's about a woman's right to choose

23:27.281 --> 23:29.915
what she wants to do with her own body.

23:29.917 --> 23:31.850
Yeah, I got pregnant
when I was real young,

23:31.852 --> 23:33.452
and I didn't want to have a kid,

23:33.454 --> 23:36.421
but my parents were against
abortion, and they made me.

23:36.423 --> 23:38.790
And I got attached to that kid.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.092
Sofia.

23:40.094 --> 23:41.460
And one day I got home,

23:41.462 --> 23:43.962
and Sofia was sent to California

23:43.964 --> 23:46.283
to live with some church friends.

23:47.201 --> 23:49.067
I never saw her again.

23:49.069 --> 23:51.970
Ann, I'm... I'm so sorry.

23:55.742 --> 23:57.209
People got your back, girl.

23:59.680 --> 24:00.879
Thanks.

24:00.881 --> 24:02.514
I needed to hear that.

24:04.051 --> 24:08.954
What if it's, like, the next Obama?

24:08.956 --> 24:12.157
Or, like, that guy
that's always dreaming?

24:13.258 --> 24:14.459
Martin Luther King?

24:14.461 --> 24:15.894
Yeah.

24:15.896 --> 24:16.995
Girl...

24:16.997 --> 24:18.463
it's not. You're fine.

24:19.633 --> 24:20.799
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah.

24:20.801 --> 24:22.100
It's no Obama in there?

24:24.037 --> 24:25.904
Okay, so, this is saying
that the director

24:25.906 --> 24:28.140
is the one who yells out the orders

24:28.142 --> 24:29.741
and everybody else does the work.

24:29.743 --> 24:30.909
Well, that should be you, boo.

24:30.911 --> 24:32.410
Boom. Okay.

24:32.412 --> 24:36.982
The producer is the one who
hires everybody for the shoot,

24:36.984 --> 24:39.017
but don't get no credit for it.

24:39.019 --> 24:41.853
Well, that should definitely be me.

24:41.855 --> 24:43.155
Because when I was in jail,

24:43.157 --> 24:45.590
I taught Lorraine in the prison cafeteria

24:45.592 --> 24:47.726
how to make
my family's famous baked ziti,

24:47.728 --> 24:50.228
but when people started
complimenting her,

24:50.230 --> 24:51.630
I didn't get any credit at all.

24:51.632 --> 24:52.998
Don't you hate that?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.566
We women should be lifting each other up

24:54.568 --> 24:57.202
instead of knocking each other
off the monkey bars.

24:57.204 --> 24:58.670
Why it gotta be monkey bars, Brenda?

24:58.672 --> 25:01.339
Oh, goodness.
Everything offends you people.

25:01.341 --> 25:03.808
"You people"? Really? You see,
that's what I'm talking about.

25:03.810 --> 25:06.378
- Okay, alright, alright, y'all!
- Why you got to say "you people"?

25:06.380 --> 25:09.080
Y'all, y'all! Let's leave
the racism to the hipsters.

25:09.082 --> 25:11.283
Come on, now. This is gonna be fun.

25:11.285 --> 25:13.018
Dean can do the art department.

25:13.020 --> 25:15.854
Ooh! Quiet Ann can be
the cinematographer.

25:15.856 --> 25:18.690
And... oh, Brenda, do you still sew?

25:18.692 --> 25:21.993
I won best stitching
at the Eagle Forum Convention.

25:21.995 --> 25:23.195
Will you make the costumes?

25:23.197 --> 25:24.563
I would love to.

25:25.465 --> 25:27.098
You are gonna die when you see

25:27.100 --> 25:29.434
the dress I made Jennifer
for tomorrow night.

25:29.436 --> 25:30.602
Whoa!

25:30.604 --> 25:32.003
Hey!

25:32.005 --> 25:33.638
Do-si-do your partner!

25:33.640 --> 25:35.607
Yee... haw.

25:35.609 --> 25:38.577
You just gon' let
the Confederate flags fly, huh?

25:38.579 --> 25:40.612
Shit. I thought it was British.

25:40.614 --> 25:41.546
Mm.

25:41.548 --> 25:43.782
You look amazing, Jennifer.

25:43.784 --> 25:45.016
Thank you, Momma.

25:45.018 --> 25:47.752
When Bryce sees you at the soiree,

25:47.754 --> 25:50.288
he is gonna fill up
your whole dance card.

25:50.290 --> 25:52.691
I'm actually going with Hank.

25:52.693 --> 25:53.892
Jennifer!

25:53.894 --> 25:56.494
Bryce is a...

25:56.496 --> 25:59.631
a white knight in Levi's.

25:59.633 --> 26:02.467
He raised a baby who wasn't even his.

26:02.469 --> 26:05.604
I know. I'm just going with Hank
so I can avoid a breakdown.

26:05.606 --> 26:07.505
Okay, well, I'm gonna help you.

26:07.507 --> 26:09.174
You know what I'm gonna do?

26:09.176 --> 26:13.511
I am going home and I'm gonna
make my cracker casserole

26:13.513 --> 26:16.281
so that you can cook your way
into his heart.

26:16.283 --> 26:17.749
Momma, thank you!

26:17.751 --> 26:19.150
- Don't mess up.
- Okay.

26:19.152 --> 26:20.418
- Back to the film!
- Please.

26:20.420 --> 26:22.053
So, Jenn, what do you want to do?

26:22.055 --> 26:23.622
Want to be a gaffer? A gaffer?

26:23.624 --> 26:25.357
No, no, I took creative writing
in community college,

26:25.359 --> 26:27.192
so I feel that I could write
this commercial.

26:27.194 --> 26:28.526
Jennifer Roylance Husser,

26:28.528 --> 26:31.529
you know damn well
you didn't go to college.

26:31.531 --> 26:32.530
Fine!

26:32.532 --> 26:34.266
How hard can writing a commercial be?

26:34.268 --> 26:36.167
It's just words, and I know words.

26:36.169 --> 26:38.103
- Just put it down.
- Great.

26:38.105 --> 26:40.438
Jenn... scribe.

26:43.176 --> 26:44.586
Excuse me.

26:45.779 --> 26:46.878
You okay?

26:46.880 --> 26:49.049
Yeah. I'm good.

26:49.483 --> 26:52.183
I-I-I-I lied about getting pencils.

26:52.185 --> 26:54.219
Uh, a-a-and I got you this instead.

26:55.455 --> 26:58.256
Dean, thank you. I love these.

26:58.258 --> 27:01.126
I-I hope you love them
as much as I love you.

27:01.128 --> 27:03.528
You changed my life, Virginia.

27:03.530 --> 27:08.733
And... And I-I want to spend
the rest of my years with you.

27:10.103 --> 27:12.704
Uh, Dean, d-does your sister
know about this?

27:12.706 --> 27:15.073
Yeah. Yeah. I talked to her
about this a while ago.

27:15.075 --> 27:16.574
She gave me her blessing.

27:16.576 --> 27:18.746
So, what do you say, Virginia?

27:19.646 --> 27:21.079
Will you marry me?

27:25.185 --> 27:26.584
We're getting married, everybody!

27:28.989 --> 27:31.122
God is good!

27:31.124 --> 27:32.357
He heard our prayers.

27:32.359 --> 27:34.826
We still D&C'd that shit, bitch!

27:46.739 --> 27:49.573
Okay, so, should I have
Dr. Ken standing here,

27:49.575 --> 27:51.809
or, like, right in here?

27:51.811 --> 27:55.079
Uh, we can still replace him
and have somebody else do it.

27:55.081 --> 27:56.313
Stop it.

27:56.315 --> 27:57.915
This is good right here.

27:57.917 --> 28:01.919
Hey, so, I was thinking a soft,
dewy look and a natural lip.

28:01.921 --> 28:03.521
You take it easy, hear?

28:03.523 --> 28:05.990
We don't need you passing out and shit.

28:05.992 --> 28:07.558
I'm good, Des.

28:07.560 --> 28:11.462
Listen, I know I was hard on you
the other day, right?

28:11.464 --> 28:14.165
But when I see you going down
the wrong path, Virginia,

28:14.167 --> 28:16.300
I just want to slap you back on.

28:16.302 --> 28:18.836
My brother has a lot of potential.

28:18.838 --> 28:20.971
But so do you.

28:20.973 --> 28:22.373
Thank you.

28:22.375 --> 28:24.575
No one's ever looked out
for me like this.

28:27.180 --> 28:29.180
Um... I've got good news.

28:30.216 --> 28:31.782
Dean proposed.

28:32.785 --> 28:34.652
- You stupid bitch!
- Whoa!

28:34.654 --> 28:37.154
Why would you have an abortion
and then get married?!

28:37.156 --> 28:38.889
What kind of ghetto shit is that?!

28:38.891 --> 28:40.925
Just s-stop it! S-Stop it!
What are you... Stop!

28:40.927 --> 28:43.828
Dean, why didn't you tell me
you were getting married?

28:43.830 --> 28:45.596
I-I did! I told you
a couple of months ago.

28:45.598 --> 28:46.831
Y-You said it was okay.

28:46.833 --> 28:48.032
I had a gun to my head!

28:48.034 --> 28:51.302
But you said...
you said it was okay, Desna.

28:51.304 --> 28:53.337
V-Virginia's... Virginia's my life.

28:53.339 --> 28:55.539
Don't you want me to be happy? I'm happy.

28:57.343 --> 29:01.011
Little girl, do not hurt him.

29:01.013 --> 29:02.179
Do you understand me?

29:02.181 --> 29:03.814
- I won't.
- S-She won't hurt me.

29:03.816 --> 29:04.682
She won't hurt me.

29:04.684 --> 29:06.083
Dean.

29:06.085 --> 29:07.318
Yeah, Des.

29:07.320 --> 29:09.453
It's time for you to man up, baby.

29:09.455 --> 29:10.888
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

29:10.890 --> 29:14.024
- Time to be a man. Okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

29:14.026 --> 29:15.025
- Yeah.
- Okay.

29:15.027 --> 29:15.893
Okay.

29:15.895 --> 29:16.927
Okay. Okay.

29:16.929 --> 29:17.928
Desna?

29:17.930 --> 29:19.182
- What?!
- We got to move.

29:19.184 --> 29:20.331
"The Bachelor" is on tonight,

29:20.333 --> 29:21.699
and unless you're paying overtime...

29:21.701 --> 29:23.026
- Okay. Where's Polly?
- I don't know.

29:23.028 --> 29:24.468
Des, I don't know, but listen.

29:24.470 --> 29:25.903
What do you think
is the better catchphrase...

29:25.905 --> 29:28.072
"No pain, no gain" or "Stop the pain"?

29:28.074 --> 29:29.140
I-I don't know.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.141
Polly?

29:30.143 --> 29:31.208
- Pol!
- Polly?

29:31.210 --> 29:33.244
Yes, sir. Right here.

29:33.246 --> 29:35.513
Qu'est ce que c'est?

29:35.515 --> 29:38.482
Uh... can you get Ken out his office?

29:38.484 --> 29:39.884
We need to do this.

29:39.886 --> 29:41.152
Copy that.

29:46.792 --> 29:50.361
Boris, I would like you
to show our new family

29:50.363 --> 29:52.029
the ways of Georgia.

29:52.031 --> 29:53.192
No.

29:53.666 --> 29:55.032
Boris.

29:57.003 --> 29:58.536
Boris.

29:58.538 --> 30:01.338
I realize that the two of you
almost killed each other

30:01.340 --> 30:03.541
last month at the amusement park,

30:03.543 --> 30:06.410
but it's time to make up,

30:06.412 --> 30:08.445
put blood under the bridge, and move on.

30:08.447 --> 30:09.513
Understand?

30:09.515 --> 30:12.883
Show him the lay of the land.

30:12.885 --> 30:14.618
It's an order.

30:21.060 --> 30:22.092
Take off clothes.

30:23.095 --> 30:24.828
We'll begin.

30:24.830 --> 30:27.331
I ain't like my Uncle Daddy, playboy.

30:30.336 --> 30:32.269
The camera adds 10 pounds.

30:32.271 --> 30:33.671
In your case, maybe 20.

30:33.673 --> 30:35.706
So you might want to... suck in your gut.

30:35.708 --> 30:37.608
Okay. Thanks, Confetta.

30:37.610 --> 30:41.545
I still can't tell
which is your good side.

30:41.547 --> 30:43.547
You might want to just look
straight ahead.

30:43.549 --> 30:45.416
Oh, and P.S...

30:45.418 --> 30:48.485
I forgot my nose hair trimmers,
so good luck.

30:49.255 --> 30:51.422
Come on! What the hell
is taking so long?!

30:51.424 --> 30:54.225
I just... I'm not feeling
the script Jenn wrote.

30:54.227 --> 30:55.693
Oh. Yeah.

30:55.695 --> 30:57.561
I probably should've written it myself

30:57.563 --> 30:59.997
'cause I was a ghostwriter
on "Thelma & Louise."

30:59.999 --> 31:01.498
But there's no emotion.

31:01.500 --> 31:04.335
It doesn't like sound me,
and honestly, it's just...

31:04.337 --> 31:06.203
It's not fresh... it's not fresh at all.

31:06.205 --> 31:07.504
Alright, then just change it!

31:07.506 --> 31:09.273
I can't. I can't change it.

31:09.275 --> 31:11.742
Jennifer's gonna be like, "You
completely changed my script, Dr. Ken."

31:11.744 --> 31:13.510
I can't believe you're trying
to rewrite the script.

31:13.512 --> 31:14.979
I spent 25 minutes on it.

31:14.981 --> 31:16.280
It didn't sound like me.

31:16.282 --> 31:18.515
It's not supposed to sound like you!
It's a character.

31:18.517 --> 31:20.818
You know what? If I would've known
that you were gonna rewrite my ass,

31:20.820 --> 31:22.953
then I would've spent my time
practicing my square dancing moves

31:22.955 --> 31:25.089
and not trying to spin hay into gold.

31:25.091 --> 31:27.591
You call this gold?
"There's no 'I' in pain"?

31:27.593 --> 31:28.792
That doesn't even make sense.

31:28.794 --> 31:30.394
- Absolutely!
- There's an "I" in pain!

31:30.396 --> 31:32.162
And according to that YouTube video,

31:32.164 --> 31:34.031
notes are just part
of the Hollywood process.

31:34.033 --> 31:36.634
Polly, we're just a couple of
blue-collar bitches in Palmetto

31:36.636 --> 31:38.502
trying to shoot a commercial
on a jizz-stained porno camera.

31:38.504 --> 31:41.338
I have made this a very professional set!

31:41.340 --> 31:43.173
Will you guys knock it off?

31:43.175 --> 31:45.442
Zlata already doesn't think
we can pull this off.

31:45.444 --> 31:47.011
Uh, who cares what the Antichrist thinks?

31:47.013 --> 31:48.679
<i>Your</i> ass should care what she thinks!

31:48.681 --> 31:50.180
Polly, put your hand down!
Because if we don't do it,

31:50.182 --> 31:51.994
you're gonna be writing our obituaries.

31:51.996 --> 31:53.050
How about that?

31:53.052 --> 31:56.186
Now, please, everybody,
get in your places!

31:56.188 --> 31:57.521
Yes, places!

31:57.523 --> 31:58.956
I just said that, Poll!

31:58.958 --> 32:00.157
You are making me hot.

32:01.427 --> 32:03.394
How you holding up, son?

32:03.396 --> 32:04.995
You missing Jenn?

32:04.997 --> 32:06.241
I don't know.

32:09.635 --> 32:12.936
Can't compare to how you feel
about Aunty Momma.

32:14.807 --> 32:17.502
Yeah, it's... it's hard.

32:18.377 --> 32:21.812
I was with that woman 32 years.

32:23.549 --> 32:25.515
I ain't ever been
with anything that long.

32:25.517 --> 32:26.917
Shit.

32:26.919 --> 32:29.153
I didn't have my hair
on my head that long.

32:34.226 --> 32:35.592
What the hell?

32:35.594 --> 32:37.061
He's being tortured!

32:37.063 --> 32:39.029
God damn it! They're torturing Roller!

33:16.135 --> 33:18.502
Ahhh!

33:18.504 --> 33:19.670
What the hell?

33:24.143 --> 33:25.976
Baby boy played us.

33:28.748 --> 33:31.181
Okay, and sound.

33:34.136 --> 33:35.649
- Um...
- Girl...

33:35.651 --> 33:37.380
- Toby, what the hell?
- My bad.

33:37.382 --> 33:38.522
We ain't got all day. Come on.

33:38.524 --> 33:39.690
Take 1.

33:39.692 --> 33:41.670
Do I have... do I have drool?

33:42.161 --> 33:43.123
Action!

33:43.125 --> 33:44.762
Here at Suncoast Rejuvenation,

33:44.764 --> 33:46.263
we know pain.

33:46.265 --> 33:49.833
Hi, I'm Dr. Kenneth Brickman,
and if you are a j...

33:49.835 --> 33:52.035
Try it again. Sorry.

33:52.037 --> 33:54.304
- Action.
- Well, hello. I didn't see you there.

33:54.306 --> 33:55.873
This is Suncoast Rejuvenation,

33:55.875 --> 33:58.108
If you or a loved one have...

33:58.110 --> 33:58.942
Line?

33:58.944 --> 34:00.444
Hi, I'm Suncoast Rejuvenation,

34:00.446 --> 34:01.945
- and this is Dr...
- No.

34:01.947 --> 34:04.411
- Here at Suncoast Rejuvenation...
- No.

34:04.413 --> 34:07.084
Here at Suncoast Rejuvenation,
we know pain.

34:07.086 --> 34:08.918
Hi, I'm Dr. Ken... I'm so hot.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.922
Can you throw me something
to wipe? I'm so...

34:11.924 --> 34:14.891
Here at Suncoast... Gajuvenation...

34:14.893 --> 34:16.560
It's not Gajuvenation!

34:16.562 --> 34:17.761
Desna.

34:17.763 --> 34:19.563
He... He's really bad.

34:19.565 --> 34:21.098
And I'm Dr. Renneth...

34:21.100 --> 34:22.433
I'm...

34:22.435 --> 34:23.801
It's horrifying.

34:23.803 --> 34:25.302
And yet I can't look away.

34:25.304 --> 34:28.038
Here at Suncoast Rejuvenation,

34:28.040 --> 34:28.972
we know pain.

34:28.974 --> 34:30.974
Hello. I'm Dr. Kenneth Brickman.

34:30.976 --> 34:34.445
<i>This</i> is Suncoast Rejuvenation!

34:34.447 --> 34:36.179
And I'm Dr. Kenneth Brickman!

34:36.181 --> 34:39.248
Hi, I'm Suncoast Rejuve...

34:39.251 --> 34:40.484
No! Cut!

34:40.485 --> 34:42.252
I'm out of breath.

34:42.254 --> 34:43.120
Cut!

34:43.121 --> 34:44.588
- My zame is...
- Cut.

34:44.590 --> 34:45.556
Cut.

34:45.558 --> 34:46.489
No.

34:46.492 --> 34:48.158
Cut! Cut.

34:48.159 --> 34:49.493
No. Cut.

34:49.495 --> 34:50.561
Cut! Cut!

34:50.563 --> 34:51.728
Bahhhhh!

34:51.730 --> 34:53.697
That'll teach his ass to go off-book.

34:53.699 --> 34:55.199
Zlata is gonna kill us, y'all.

34:55.201 --> 34:56.867
Okay, can... can I get some water?

34:56.869 --> 34:58.535
- Please!
- Okay, some space.

34:58.537 --> 35:00.771
- Please!
- Space for the director!

35:03.209 --> 35:04.374
Here.

35:04.376 --> 35:06.009
Well, I know you asked for water,

35:06.011 --> 35:07.845
but I thought I'd be proactive.

35:15.588 --> 35:17.054
Pol.

35:17.056 --> 35:19.600
Can you get your boy toys
into hair and makeup?

35:19.625 --> 35:21.158
I got an idea.

35:36.491 --> 35:37.723
Stop the pain!

36:52.767 --> 36:55.280
<i>Stop the pain!</i>

36:55.650 --> 36:59.071
Yes! We did it, y'all.

36:59.073 --> 37:00.940
Th-Those dance moves
are really impressive.

37:00.942 --> 37:04.076
Y'all, calm down. We haven't
done anything yet, okay?

37:04.078 --> 37:05.978
Nobody is retweeting it.

37:05.980 --> 37:07.146
This might be all bad.

37:07.148 --> 37:08.710
Refresh the computer.

37:09.884 --> 37:11.384
That's not how it works, Des.

37:11.386 --> 37:13.285
Just hold on, Des.
These things take time.

37:13.287 --> 37:15.688
Oh, oh! Not too much time.

37:15.690 --> 37:16.922
We just got retweeted.

37:16.924 --> 37:18.224
- You lyin'.
- Nope.

37:18.226 --> 37:20.659
We goin' viral, y'all...
just like my sex tape.

37:20.661 --> 37:21.994
You lyin'!

37:22.997 --> 37:23.996
Put 'em in!

37:25.500 --> 37:26.399
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

37:30.371 --> 37:32.271
- Ah! Shit!
- You little shit!

37:32.273 --> 37:34.974
You're supposed to be
getting intel, God damn it!

37:34.976 --> 37:37.443
I did! Damn! Boris told me everything!

37:37.445 --> 37:39.678
They open up 10 clinics
at the end of the year,

37:39.680 --> 37:40.739
and they get the coke

37:40.764 --> 37:41.881
- from the Colombians.
- Wait... Colombians?

37:41.883 --> 37:44.521
What kind of Pablo Escobar
bullshit is that?

37:44.523 --> 37:47.153
The Colombians bring the coke
to Palmetto on fishing boats.

37:47.155 --> 37:48.521
Oh, hell no.

37:48.523 --> 37:50.122
Boy, hell no!

37:50.124 --> 37:51.490
We get nabbed by the Feds

37:51.492 --> 37:52.992
running drugs for the Colombians,

37:52.994 --> 37:55.327
we'll get our... our salads
tossed in South Bay

37:55.329 --> 37:57.329
for the rest of our lives,
you understand?

37:57.331 --> 38:00.266
On the bright side of things,
we don't got to use bugs.

38:01.035 --> 38:02.435
I'm in the game now, baby.

38:02.437 --> 38:04.136
Finna crush that whole operation.

38:08.209 --> 38:09.508
Clay Husser?

38:09.510 --> 38:11.210
Don't you look like a hot cup of tea.

38:11.212 --> 38:12.511
I know.

38:12.513 --> 38:15.848
Look, I'm here to see
my favorite son-in-law.

38:15.850 --> 38:17.583
I brought gifts.

38:29.197 --> 38:31.163
Desna, come in.

38:35.603 --> 38:39.004
So, your bold idea worked.

38:39.006 --> 38:41.807
I took a page out of your book, Zlata.

38:41.809 --> 38:44.944
I found a dick and rode it like a boss.

38:44.946 --> 38:46.145
Yes!

38:46.147 --> 38:49.048
Pussy power, girlfriend! I love!

38:54.288 --> 38:56.689
Ohhh! Whoo! God damn!

38:56.691 --> 38:58.557
You always could cook, Ms. Brenda.

38:58.559 --> 39:00.659
Well, people always forget
about the recipes

39:00.661 --> 39:03.729
on the back of the Ritz cracker
box, but <i> I</i> don't.

39:03.731 --> 39:05.998
Mm-hmm.

39:06.000 --> 39:10.169
Well, enough with the small talk.

39:10.171 --> 39:12.605
I think you know why I'm here,
Bryce-y boo.

39:13.574 --> 39:16.675
We need to chat about my daughter.

39:16.677 --> 39:18.089
She's a...

39:18.779 --> 39:22.114
complicated butterfly.

39:41.235 --> 39:42.468
Dr. Ken.

39:42.470 --> 39:45.471
I need to come by and see you.

39:45.473 --> 39:50.576
My back's hurtin' real bad,
and it needs to be fixed.

39:53.614 --> 39:56.048
Take my card. "Stop the pain."

39:58.953 --> 40:00.653
Ooh, Kenneth!

40:00.655 --> 40:02.087
You got a fan.

40:03.691 --> 40:05.991
You ever gotten a handie in public?

40:07.862 --> 40:09.328
Scooch your chair up.

40:19.340 --> 40:22.041
Can we get this white shit started?

40:22.043 --> 40:23.609
D.

40:26.414 --> 40:29.248
Just one foot
in front of the other, right?

40:29.250 --> 40:30.649
You got this, friend.

40:42.563 --> 40:47.199
Alright, ladies and
gentlemen, let's get this do-si-do going!

40:47.201 --> 40:49.301
Let's bring out the first group!

40:59.547 --> 41:01.680
All join hands in a big ol' ring.

41:01.682 --> 41:04.783
Circle around with your own dear thing.

41:04.785 --> 41:06.085
Go, Jenn!

41:06.087 --> 41:07.453
Whoo!

41:07.455 --> 41:09.655
Oh, my golly, oh, by Joe,

41:09.657 --> 41:11.991
take your partner by the left
and do-si-do.

41:14.762 --> 41:16.428
Partner left and corner right,

41:16.430 --> 41:18.931
then do-si-do with all your might.

41:23.304 --> 41:25.104
Now promenade like it's your job.

41:25.106 --> 41:28.607
You fell on his dick
like corn on the cob.

41:28.609 --> 41:30.643
Now allemande left with the corner maid.

41:30.645 --> 41:32.978
You screwed up your marriage
just trying to get laid.

41:35.483 --> 41:37.483
Why'd you go and shatter his world?

41:37.485 --> 41:39.652
He raised your other kid
like his own little girl.

41:42.923 --> 41:45.157
If temptation falls
and you give a rimjob,

41:45.159 --> 41:48.761
say "Sorry" to your husband
before you break down and sob.

41:50.331 --> 41:52.431
What happened to "'Til death do us part"?

41:52.433 --> 41:54.400
You took a knife and stabbed his heart.

41:54.402 --> 41:56.135
Look at you now, all alone.

41:56.137 --> 41:58.537
Remember, Luther Vandross sang
"A House is not a Home."

41:58.539 --> 42:00.172
You messed this up, poor little girl.

42:00.174 --> 42:02.941
Now you'll have to use Tinder,
like the rest of the world.

42:04.145 --> 42:06.211
Shalom, y'all!

42:10.651 --> 42:11.717
Shit.

42:21.663 --> 42:23.363
That Putin bitch has got to go.

42:23.365 --> 42:24.831
He's right, Ruval.

42:24.833 --> 42:27.567
We finna get twisted up
in some Colombian shit.

42:35.444 --> 42:37.444
Bryce!

42:37.446 --> 42:40.147
She ruined my businesses,
she killed my wife.

42:40.149 --> 42:41.915
I ain't taking this slowly!

42:43.626 --> 42:47.528
Clay, why do you think
your people abandoned you?

42:47.553 --> 42:49.753
You need to stick to the plan.

42:49.778 --> 42:51.444
I will take care of this.

42:51.593 --> 42:54.794
<i>Bryce! Baby, it's me!
Listen, we need to talk!</i>

42:54.796 --> 42:57.030
<i>I have so many things to say!</i>

42:58.800 --> 43:00.233
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

43:01.237 --> 43:02.236
Hey. What's happening?

43:02.261 --> 43:03.460
Where's my husband?

43:03.485 --> 43:04.785
Upstairs. Not feeling too well.

43:04.810 --> 43:06.509
Your mom's cooking's
a little questionable.

43:06.534 --> 43:08.301
Tell her to stick to the microwave.

43:08.326 --> 43:09.458
Babe, I ju...

43:09.483 --> 43:11.417
No way. Uh, uh...

43:11.442 --> 43:12.841
You filthy little skank.

43:12.866 --> 43:14.866
Oh, no. I was just prepping him for you.

43:29.331 --> 43:30.297
Hey.

43:30.299 --> 43:33.200
I was, um, just calling to see

43:33.202 --> 43:34.991
if I can make that dinner up to you.

43:34.993 --> 43:36.803
I would love that.

43:36.805 --> 43:38.171
What are you doing later?

43:38.173 --> 43:40.574
I'm doing <i> you</i> later if I'm lucky.

43:40.576 --> 43:41.608
Ohh! Ohh!

43:41.610 --> 43:43.076
Shut up!

43:45.147 --> 43:47.581
Let me call you when I get home.

43:47.583 --> 43:49.883
Come on, y'all.

43:54.456 --> 43:55.622
Oh, hell no!

43:55.624 --> 43:57.691
Hey! Get off!

44:20.983 --> 44:23.183
Whoa, whoa! Hey, get off! Get off!

44:23.185 --> 44:24.284
Get off!

44:41.870 --> 44:42.744
I'm real sorry, y'all.

44:42.769 --> 44:44.293
- I'm sorry y'all had to see that.
- No.

44:44.295 --> 44:48.308
I mean, she's not always been
the best momma, but, you know...

44:48.310 --> 44:50.343
I just didn't think she would
do something like that.

44:50.345 --> 44:53.079
She made me this outfit,
and she did my makeup.

44:53.081 --> 44:54.581
Why would she do that?

44:54.583 --> 44:57.008
Why did she do that?
Why would she do that?

44:57.010 --> 44:59.286
Why did she do that?!
