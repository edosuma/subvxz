WEBVTT

00:05.931 --> 00:06.999
You know what I was thinking?

00:07.034 --> 00:09.707
I want to compile
the most horrific

00:09.742 --> 00:11.610
scenes in comic book history,

00:11.645 --> 00:14.049
the ones that just hit you
right here when you read it.

00:14.084 --> 00:15.789
What's your gut punch?

00:15.824 --> 00:17.426
- Green Lantern 53.
- Oh.

00:17.461 --> 00:19.197
Woman in a refrigerator.

00:19.231 --> 00:20.767
- Major Force.
- Bad guy, Major Force.

00:20.801 --> 00:23.171
Bad guy, folded up
his girlfriend,

00:23.206 --> 00:24.743
tortured her and killed her,
and then

00:24.778 --> 00:26.414
stuffed her in a refrigerator.

00:26.448 --> 00:29.218
Can you top that?
Can you top that brutality?

00:29.253 --> 00:30.657
There's a lot of stuff from
the Watchmen.

00:30.692 --> 00:32.195
Uh, you know...

00:32.229 --> 00:34.503
- Dr. Manhattan's penis, maybe.
- What?

00:34.537 --> 00:35.808
[Laughter]
What are you talking about?

00:35.843 --> 00:37.245
You know, big, blue,
glowing guy.

00:37.279 --> 00:38.880
- Yes.
- But they go to a panel,

00:38.914 --> 00:40.048
he's not wearing any pants.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.450
You see everything,
full frontal.

00:41.484 --> 00:44.057
What about that?
That was pretty horrific.

00:44.092 --> 00:46.329
Mike brings me, "woman folded
up in a refrigerator,"

00:46.363 --> 00:47.698
you seen a blue [Bleep].

00:47.733 --> 00:49.001
Come on!

00:49.035 --> 00:50.170
Can you imagine if somebody
comes to the counter?

00:50.204 --> 00:51.875
They're, like, "sir, um..."
[Laughter]

00:51.909 --> 00:55.950
"I'm looking for a few panels
of... of horrific atrocities."

00:55.984 --> 00:56.951
[Laughter]

00:56.985 --> 00:58.119
"Let me tell you something.

00:58.154 --> 00:59.690
Have you heard
of the blue [Bleep]?"

00:59.724 --> 01:01.825
[Laughter]

01:34.653 --> 01:37.859
Hello, and welcome to another
episode of Comic Book Men,

01:37.893 --> 01:40.062
the only show that prefers
the negative zone

01:40.096 --> 01:42.699
to the erogenous zone.
I'm your host, Kevin Smith.

01:42.734 --> 01:44.335
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

01:44.369 --> 01:46.105
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.776
Walt, what has come through
the door this week?

01:54.286 --> 01:55.957
- Whoa.
- How you guys doing today?

01:55.992 --> 01:58.098
- What's up?
- This is the screen-used

01:58.132 --> 02:00.335
Rick Moranis pith helmet
from Spaceballs.

02:00.369 --> 02:02.038
- Ah.
- The movie?

02:02.072 --> 02:03.441
Yes.

02:09.517 --> 02:11.818
When he orders his troopers
to comb the desert,

02:11.853 --> 02:13.086
this is what he's wearing.

02:13.121 --> 02:15.521
Rick Moranis has touched it
and worn it?

02:15.555 --> 02:16.521
Yes.

02:16.556 --> 02:18.625
And how do we verify that?

02:18.659 --> 02:20.929
Well, I won it in a poker game

02:20.963 --> 02:23.700
from the guy who won it
in the auction.

02:23.735 --> 02:25.235
Oh, verified then.
Won it in a poker game.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.270
[Laughter]

02:26.304 --> 02:27.605
You got any paperwork
for this?

02:27.639 --> 02:29.574
Uh, the guy I won it from has
the paperwork.

02:29.608 --> 02:30.909
I can get it for you
if you need it.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.143
I don't remember this one,
do you?

02:32.178 --> 02:34.010
I've seen Spaceballs
like ten times.

02:34.044 --> 02:35.010
I don't... I don't really remember
this helmet, though.

02:35.044 --> 02:36.145
What?

02:36.179 --> 02:37.280
You've seen Spaceballs
ten times?

02:37.314 --> 02:38.515
I've seen it like
ten times, yeah.

02:38.549 --> 02:39.516
- How did you miss that scene?
- Oh, my God.

02:39.550 --> 02:40.550
- Yeah, seriously?
- Oh, my Lord.

02:40.584 --> 02:41.816
- Do you remember it?
- Of course.

02:41.851 --> 02:44.118
All right, well, talk to
the expert here then.

02:44.153 --> 02:45.353
There must have been,
like, what, like,

02:45.387 --> 02:46.487
a three-second scene
or something.

02:46.521 --> 02:48.121
It wasn't
a three-second scene.

02:48.156 --> 02:50.090
It was, like,
a five-minute scene.

02:50.124 --> 02:51.825
I mean, it must have been
so funny that I was...

02:51.860 --> 02:53.361
I was laughing so hard that I...

02:53.395 --> 02:55.030
I couldn't even look at
the screen then.

02:55.064 --> 02:56.966
Oh, you can't... don't...
don't sell out on Spaceballs.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.669
[Laughter]

02:58.705 --> 03:00.038
When you were a little boy,
it made you happy

03:00.072 --> 03:01.273
and smile in your heart
and stuff.

03:01.307 --> 03:02.675
- It did.
- And now you're, like,

03:02.709 --> 03:05.277
around these tough kids,
"I don't like Spaceballs."

03:05.312 --> 03:06.545
[Laughter]

03:06.580 --> 03:09.048
Now as a guy
who's seen this ten times,

03:09.082 --> 03:11.318
I can only imagine
you're frothing at the mouth

03:11.352 --> 03:12.419
to put this on.

03:12.454 --> 03:13.487
- Can I?
- Sure.

03:13.522 --> 03:16.023
- Just like this?
- There.

03:16.058 --> 03:18.026
[Laughter]

03:18.061 --> 03:19.962
- Imagine this is in the bushes.
- [Laughs]

03:19.997 --> 03:24.066
Popping up?
[Laughter]

03:24.100 --> 03:25.667
You would get tased
so quick, man.

03:25.702 --> 03:27.771
[Laughter]

03:27.805 --> 03:29.073
Oh, yet it felt comfortable.

03:29.107 --> 03:30.440
What are you looking
to get for it?

03:30.475 --> 03:32.074
The last helmet that came up
on auction

03:32.109 --> 03:35.146
went for $10,000 in 2006.

03:35.181 --> 03:39.382
I figure $6,000 for me
leaves plenty of room

03:39.417 --> 03:40.817
for the stash to make some cash.

03:40.851 --> 03:42.452
You're a bit
of a poker player, right?

03:42.487 --> 03:43.987
I've played a few hands.

03:44.022 --> 03:47.026
- Why don't we play for it?
- Mm.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.093
What are the odds?

03:48.128 --> 03:49.462
Whoever draws
the highest card.

03:49.496 --> 03:50.964
You draw the higher card,
we give you

03:50.999 --> 03:52.433
what you're looking for.
We draw the higher card,

03:52.468 --> 03:53.902
we win... we get it for free.

03:53.936 --> 03:55.471
No.
[All shouting]

03:55.505 --> 03:57.240
- What's up, Mr. High Stakes?
- Oh, yeah.

03:57.275 --> 03:58.508
Huh?

03:58.542 --> 03:59.910
Give me a little bit
more edge, and we might...

03:59.944 --> 04:01.445
we might pull...
pull high card for it,

04:01.480 --> 04:02.647
but it ain't...
[Laughter]

04:02.681 --> 04:05.281
It ain't 0 or 6,000,
that's for sure.

04:05.316 --> 04:07.083
- [Laughter]
- Oh, I like that.

04:07.117 --> 04:08.085
- I like that, though.
- Yeah?

04:08.120 --> 04:09.221
Yeah.

04:09.255 --> 04:10.323
Yeah, I'm gonna have
to pass on it.

04:10.358 --> 04:11.592
All right, man.
Well, thanks a lot.

04:11.627 --> 04:12.892
- All right.
- All right.

04:12.927 --> 04:14.126
- Appreciate seeing it, though.
- Good luck moving it.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.159
Yeah, thank you so much
for bringing it in.

04:15.194 --> 04:16.661
No problem, man.
No problem.

04:16.696 --> 04:18.700
Take it easy.

04:23.444 --> 04:26.013
How about Batwing?
How many we got over there?

04:26.047 --> 04:29.550
- Uh, zero.
- Let's bump that up then.

04:29.584 --> 04:31.415
Green Arrow?

04:31.449 --> 04:32.814
Six.

04:32.848 --> 04:34.514
All right.

04:34.549 --> 04:36.416
- Hello there.
- Hi.

04:36.450 --> 04:39.986
I'm looking for a Mego figure.

04:40.020 --> 04:43.086
- A Mego figure, okay.
- Of Uhura.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.487
- Lieutenant Uhura?
- Uh-huh.

04:44.522 --> 04:45.489
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

04:45.523 --> 04:47.257
- Are you Nichelle Nichols?
- Yes.

04:47.291 --> 04:49.258
- I am a huge fan.
- Oh, thank you very much.

04:49.292 --> 04:50.759
My name is Michael.

04:50.794 --> 04:54.531
Walt, this lady played
Lieutenant Uhura on Star Trek.

04:54.565 --> 04:55.566
Get out of here.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.070
- You played Uhura on TV?
- Of course.

04:58.104 --> 04:59.738
That's why I want the figure.

04:59.773 --> 05:03.346
Everybody's got one except me.
[Laughter]

05:03.380 --> 05:06.183
Oh, get out of here, man!
Nichelle Nichols?

05:06.217 --> 05:08.084
The very first woman of space.

05:08.118 --> 05:10.486
- She was looking for her Mego?
- She was looking for her Mego.

05:10.520 --> 05:13.390
Mike being the resident
trekkie of the group, man,

05:13.425 --> 05:16.361
a member of the original Trek
Bridge in the store,

05:16.395 --> 05:17.596
you must've been going crazy.

05:17.631 --> 05:19.498
I was geeking out
all over the place.

05:19.532 --> 05:23.231
Just, kind of,
phasers on "fun."

05:23.265 --> 05:25.032
[Laughter]

05:25.066 --> 05:26.567
You should have
a case of these.

05:26.601 --> 05:27.834
- I should.
- Yeah.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.301
But oddly enough, I don't.

05:30.336 --> 05:33.608
Oh, cheap bastards at Mego.
I'm telling you.

05:33.642 --> 05:35.107
Pardon my French.

05:35.141 --> 05:37.776
I imagine that you want
one that looks

05:37.811 --> 05:39.947
just like it looked in the '70s,

05:39.982 --> 05:40.949
- Just as you purchased it...
- Right off the rack.

05:40.983 --> 05:43.017
Was it that far ago?

05:43.052 --> 05:46.453
Uh, you know...

05:46.487 --> 05:47.553
you look fantastic.

05:47.588 --> 05:49.120
I mean, you know,
what is time?

05:49.155 --> 05:50.820
- And we'll give you the best.
- All right.

05:50.855 --> 05:52.454
- I mean, mint on card.
- All right.

05:52.488 --> 05:54.288
We'll get you the best one
we can find.

05:54.323 --> 05:56.186
How soon?

05:56.221 --> 05:57.520
Um...

05:57.554 --> 06:00.322
I'm only gonna be in town
for a couple more hours.

06:00.356 --> 06:02.357
You think you can get it
before then?

06:04.324 --> 06:05.723
- A couple more hours?
- Yeah.

06:05.758 --> 06:08.828
Um... Yeah.

06:08.863 --> 06:10.630
I think we could definitely
find one, right?

06:10.665 --> 06:12.567
- Okay.
- You want to pop back in and...

06:12.601 --> 06:14.270
- Very good.
- We'll get this done for you.

06:14.304 --> 06:15.637
- All right, okay.
- Thank you.

06:15.671 --> 06:17.270
Thank you.

06:17.304 --> 06:18.738
- Don't forget.
- I'm not... we're...

06:18.772 --> 06:20.007
- Forget?
- We're on it right now.

06:20.041 --> 06:21.007
We won't forget.

06:21.042 --> 06:23.374
This is a mission
from the stars.

06:23.408 --> 06:27.848
A 1974 Lieutenant Uhura
Mego mint on card?

06:27.882 --> 06:28.915
Two hours?

06:28.949 --> 06:31.083
- That's crazy.
- I am not disappointing

06:31.117 --> 06:32.919
a Lieutenant
in the starfleet command.

06:32.954 --> 06:35.859
I want you to tweet it,
Facebook it, text.

06:35.894 --> 06:37.627
I don't care what you got to do.
Find one.

06:37.661 --> 06:39.729
Mike, call Marco.

06:39.764 --> 06:41.198
- I'm gonna call Rob Bruce.
- Okay.

06:41.232 --> 06:43.099
Let's blanket this town, man.

06:43.133 --> 06:44.332
If we're going down,

06:44.366 --> 06:46.100
I'm not going down without
a fight.

06:46.134 --> 06:47.668
I'm looking for X-Men 101.

06:47.702 --> 06:49.037
- First Phoenix, right?
- Mm-hmm.

06:49.072 --> 06:50.507
There she is.

06:50.541 --> 06:52.242
I'm calling about
your Mego collection.

06:52.276 --> 06:54.144
Lieutenant Uhura is gonna
be back here in 45 minutes.

06:54.178 --> 06:55.179
Let's go!

06:57.897 --> 07:00.639
- Thanks, guys.
- Thank you.

07:01.973 --> 07:03.506
- How you doing?
- Hi.

07:03.540 --> 07:04.938
I'm looking for
a specific comic today.

07:04.973 --> 07:07.843
- All right.
- X-Men 101, from 1976.

07:07.877 --> 07:09.778
- First Phoenix, right?
- Mm-hmm.

07:09.812 --> 07:10.778
Can you grab that
for me, Mike?

07:10.813 --> 07:12.513
- I will.
- So, big Jean Grey fan?

07:12.548 --> 07:13.914
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

07:13.948 --> 07:15.581
Definitely my favorite book
and my favorite character.

07:15.615 --> 07:17.684
- Oh, there she is.
- Ah!

07:24.760 --> 07:26.093
Why Jean Grey?

07:26.127 --> 07:28.160
Well, she was, like,
the original X-Men girl.

07:28.195 --> 07:29.361
She was the first part of
the team,

07:29.396 --> 07:30.796
and when I was a kid,
I was dyslexic.

07:30.831 --> 07:32.964
So comics kind of got me
into reading more

07:32.999 --> 07:34.365
because of the pictures.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.634
So I've been reading it
pretty much my whole life.

07:36.668 --> 07:38.269
Check out her tattoo.

07:38.303 --> 07:40.738
- I'm a superfan. [Laughs]
- Oh, yeah.

07:40.772 --> 07:42.073
- Phoenix tattoo, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

07:42.107 --> 07:44.511
Definitely my all-time
favorite superhero.

07:44.546 --> 07:45.915
You were in love
with Jean Grey, right?

07:45.949 --> 07:48.384
She was an important character
to me, yeah.

07:48.418 --> 07:49.986
She was... uh, I felt...

07:50.020 --> 07:51.155
just admit it!
[Laughs]

07:51.189 --> 07:52.489
This is the one
you cried about, right?

07:52.524 --> 07:55.122
No, that was 137,
the death of Jean Grey.

07:55.157 --> 07:57.355
I thought you cried over
every book she was ever in.

07:57.390 --> 07:59.725
[Laughter]

07:59.759 --> 08:01.561
It was devastating to me.
I was in the middle of

08:01.595 --> 08:04.363
a comic book store,
standing by a squeaky rack,

08:04.398 --> 08:06.265
and one tear rolled down
my face.

08:06.299 --> 08:08.368
- No!
- I was, like, 12 years old.

08:08.402 --> 08:10.001
- [Laughter]
- No!

08:10.036 --> 08:11.569
That's comics, man.
That dude,

08:11.603 --> 08:13.203
he's righteous in his love
of comics.

08:13.238 --> 08:14.205
Is that... is that what
we're calling it?

08:14.239 --> 08:16.375
[Laughter]

08:16.409 --> 08:18.144
God, I've... I've heard
this story before,

08:18.178 --> 08:19.311
but I always thought
you were, like,

08:19.346 --> 08:21.314
at least alone in your bedroom.
[Laughter]

08:21.349 --> 08:25.651
You were out in public!
[Laughter]

08:25.685 --> 08:27.653
- What do you think?
- I love it.

08:27.687 --> 08:29.489
How much are you selling it for?

08:29.523 --> 08:30.490
What are we looking to get
for this, Mike?

08:30.524 --> 08:32.024
150.

08:32.058 --> 08:33.759
Would you be able to do 90
on it?

08:33.793 --> 08:35.227
Couldn't do 90.

08:35.261 --> 08:38.798
I could sell that at 150, easy.

08:38.832 --> 08:40.669
Uhyou can't do
any lower on it?

08:40.703 --> 08:44.042
Um, I'll knock 10 bucks off.
140.

08:44.076 --> 08:46.412
I'm happy with 140.

08:49.283 --> 08:50.249
There you go.

08:50.284 --> 08:51.251
- Thank you!
- All right, thanks.

08:51.285 --> 08:53.352
Enjoy it, as much as I did.

08:56.493 --> 08:57.664
Hey, how you doing?

08:57.698 --> 08:59.366
I'm calling about
your Mego collection.

08:59.401 --> 09:04.408
I'm looking for a mint on card
Star Trek Uhura figure.

09:04.442 --> 09:05.843
Time crunch, two hours.

09:05.877 --> 09:08.412
No, I can't use it loose.
I need it mint on card.

09:08.446 --> 09:10.013
Do you know anybody
who might have one?

09:10.047 --> 09:11.282
- Tell me something good, Ming.
- Yeah.

09:11.316 --> 09:12.285
I-I thought... I thought

09:12.319 --> 09:14.120
I found one in Trenton.
Nothing.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.621
All right, Ming.
Come on, man.

09:15.656 --> 09:18.091
Move on to the next one.
Stop with the convo.

09:18.126 --> 09:19.959
- I'm trying.
- All right, keep trying.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.226
I'm trying.
I'm on it.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.861
We are given
an impossible task.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.763
Two hours to find
a mint on card

09:25.798 --> 09:28.836
Mego doll is a Kobayashi Maru.

09:28.870 --> 09:33.542
The kobayashi maru, Walt,
is the unwinnable situation.

09:33.576 --> 09:36.312
It's what every captain has
to face in starfleet.

09:36.346 --> 09:37.313
Oh, this is a
Star Trek reference?

09:37.347 --> 09:38.481
- Yes.
- Oh, okay.

09:38.516 --> 09:39.850
Oh, yeah.
It's the no-win scenario,

09:39.885 --> 09:42.554
a test that you go through where
you're going to die

09:42.589 --> 09:44.990
and they just test
your reaction to it.

09:45.025 --> 09:47.926
Only Captain Kirk found
a way around the Kobayashi Maru.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.061
He reprogrammed the test.

09:50.095 --> 09:51.695
- He cheated.
- Yeah.

09:51.730 --> 09:56.833
Aha, who cares?
[Laughter]

09:56.867 --> 09:59.068
Yeah, an Uhura, mint on card.

09:59.102 --> 10:01.369
No, no, no.
I need somebody local.

10:01.404 --> 10:03.338
- I need it today.
- Come on, boys.

10:03.372 --> 10:06.444
Lieutenant Uhura is gonna
be back here in 45 minutes.

10:06.478 --> 10:08.546
- Working on it.
- T-minus 45, let's go!

10:08.580 --> 10:09.915
I'm trying.

10:09.950 --> 10:13.490
There is no "try."
There is only "do."

10:13.525 --> 10:15.827
Wrong movie.
That's Star Wars.

10:15.861 --> 10:19.096
[Bleep] you, Ming.

10:19.131 --> 10:20.464
We're making calls.

10:20.499 --> 10:21.766
I got Rob Bruce looking.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.667
I got all my connections

10:23.702 --> 10:26.037
checking up, down, left, right.

10:26.071 --> 10:29.210
I mean, we're exhausting
all avenues to find this mego.

10:29.244 --> 10:30.677
I'm looking everywhere I can.
I go online.

10:30.712 --> 10:32.411
I look for local collectors.

10:32.446 --> 10:34.115
I make some calls
to some customers.

10:34.150 --> 10:35.920
In all fairness,
he was walking around out

10:35.954 --> 10:38.125
on broad street,
just asking random people

10:38.160 --> 10:40.261
before Walt's like,
"would you go online, please?"

10:40.295 --> 10:43.198
[Laughter]

10:43.232 --> 10:44.634
And how much did
you want for it?

10:44.669 --> 10:46.204
Awesome.
Awesome.

10:46.238 --> 10:47.773
All right, I'll be there
in about 20 minutes.

10:47.807 --> 10:49.507
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

10:49.542 --> 10:51.278
I found one!

10:51.312 --> 10:52.614
- What?
- I found one.

10:52.648 --> 10:54.016
There's a private seller
in eatontown.

10:54.051 --> 10:55.417
- You're sure it's a Mego?
- It's a Mego.

10:55.452 --> 10:57.586
Mego, mint on card,
perfect cond... he said,

10:57.620 --> 10:58.751
"perfect condition," everything.

10:58.785 --> 10:59.784
All right, well,
she's gonna be back here

10:59.819 --> 11:00.784
in a half hour, man.

11:00.819 --> 11:01.786
You got time.
Let's go, man.

11:01.820 --> 11:02.788
- All right.
- Go!

11:02.822 --> 11:04.324
Great job.
Good work.

11:04.358 --> 11:06.892
Speed, Ming, speed!

11:06.927 --> 11:07.893
How you doing?

11:07.928 --> 11:09.027
I am looking to sell

11:09.062 --> 11:10.162
my pretty awesome He-Man statue.

11:10.196 --> 11:12.031
This is an impressive-looking
He-Man.

11:12.066 --> 11:13.533
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

11:13.568 --> 11:14.836
You got my Mego yet?

11:14.870 --> 11:15.971
Just give us
a few more seconds.

11:16.005 --> 11:18.006
It'll be here.

11:24.694 --> 11:25.692
Now the Star Trek TV show

11:25.727 --> 11:27.360
was always more
philosophically bent,

11:27.394 --> 11:29.194
as you were apt to point out.

11:29.229 --> 11:31.229
A lot of talking,
not a lot of fighting.

11:31.263 --> 11:33.731
So George Lucas sees Star Trek
and he goes,

11:33.766 --> 11:37.202
"I like the 'Star.'
I don't like the 'Trek' so much.

11:37.236 --> 11:39.302
If we're gonna go to space,
let's make a war."

11:39.337 --> 11:41.869
So he turns Star Trek
into Star Wars.

11:41.904 --> 11:45.172
Now J.J. Abrams, a big fan
of Star Wars as a kid,

11:45.207 --> 11:47.376
grows up to make
a Star Trek movie

11:47.411 --> 11:50.379
that is less like
the Star Trek TV show.

11:50.414 --> 11:52.683
They don't really philosophize
in the J.J. Star Trek movie.

11:52.717 --> 11:55.048
They're just like,
"Run, Spock!

11:55.083 --> 11:56.716
Things are dying!"
[Laughter]

11:56.751 --> 11:59.718
It's very active,
very action-oriented.

11:59.753 --> 12:04.323
And based on doing that, they
gave J.J. Abrams Star Wars.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.425
And we used to fight
about which was better,

12:06.460 --> 12:08.061
Star Trek or Star Wars.

12:08.096 --> 12:10.397
Now they're the exact
same thing, man.

12:10.431 --> 12:12.432
[Laughter]

12:18.278 --> 12:19.445
Have you guys ever been able
to use

12:19.479 --> 12:22.148
a catchphrase without sounding
like an idiot?

12:22.183 --> 12:23.451
You mean, like, an original?

12:23.485 --> 12:24.519
No, like, "Where's the beef?"

12:24.553 --> 12:25.620
"I'll be back."

12:25.654 --> 12:27.254
I've used that
a couple of times.

12:27.289 --> 12:28.589
When did you use it
and you thought you were cool?

12:28.624 --> 12:30.759
When, uh, when Terminator 2
was still out.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.229
- When it was still in theaters.
- Who'd you use it on?

12:32.263 --> 12:35.232
Oh, you know, my girlfriend at
the time, you know, or friends.

12:35.266 --> 12:36.267
And they...

12:36.301 --> 12:38.971
they enjoyed it?
[Laughter]

12:39.006 --> 12:40.472
Come on.
Do you have a favorite one?

12:40.507 --> 12:41.974
Very simple, one word.

12:42.008 --> 12:44.111
The fonz.
"'Ey."

12:44.145 --> 12:46.444
- Or "sit on it."
- "Sit on it" was a good one.

12:46.479 --> 12:48.012
I said "sit on it" once
in front of my parents.

12:48.046 --> 12:50.381
My father beat me unconscious,
so I never used it again.

12:50.415 --> 12:51.481
[Laughter]

12:51.516 --> 12:53.149
I went back to "hey"
after that.

12:53.183 --> 12:55.884
Do you remember what a low
blow it was just to tell someone

12:55.919 --> 12:57.085
"Up your nose
with a rubber hose"?

12:57.120 --> 12:58.420
- [Laughs]
- Yeah, those were popularized

12:58.454 --> 13:00.254
- by Vinnie Barbarino.
- Vinnie, yep.

13:00.288 --> 13:02.290
"Up your nose
with a rubber hose."

13:02.324 --> 13:04.526
To think that
only mere decades ago,

13:04.561 --> 13:08.159
that was the height of insult.
[Laughter]

13:08.194 --> 13:10.128
- How you doing?
- What's going on, man?

13:10.163 --> 13:13.065
I am looking to sell
my pretty awesome He-Man statue.

13:13.100 --> 13:16.300
Damn, man, this is
an impressive-looking he-man.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.477
Everybody remembers the he-man,

13:24.512 --> 13:26.414
you know, with the...
with the bowl cut.

13:26.449 --> 13:28.483
- Check this out, boy.
- This is the redesign

13:28.518 --> 13:29.751
for the 200x cartoon.

13:29.785 --> 13:31.519
Wow.
That's much more awesome.

13:31.554 --> 13:32.789
[Chuckling]

13:32.824 --> 13:33.792
Were you saying...
was that sarcastic?

13:33.826 --> 13:35.028
Yes.

13:35.062 --> 13:36.398
It's hard to tell with you.

13:36.432 --> 13:37.399
- It's hard to tell with you.
- You can't tell?

13:37.433 --> 13:38.400
No.
[Laughter]

13:38.434 --> 13:39.568
Usually you are slobbering

13:39.602 --> 13:41.003
over anything from
the '80s that comes in.

13:41.037 --> 13:43.039
- Yeah, not... yeah, not today.
- How come?

13:43.074 --> 13:45.309
It's He-Man.
You like He-Man?

13:45.343 --> 13:46.609
There's some things
I like about it.

13:46.643 --> 13:47.676
There's a lot of cool stuff

13:47.710 --> 13:49.345
- in that cartoon.
- Like what?

13:49.380 --> 13:51.082
- Skeletor.
- Okay, Skeletor was cool.

13:51.117 --> 13:52.150
Battle Cat.

13:52.184 --> 13:53.885
- Whatever, it wasn't that cool.
- What?

13:53.919 --> 13:55.519
Andand look at
the characters' names, like,

13:55.553 --> 13:58.353
He-Man, Man-at-Arms, Ram Man.

13:58.387 --> 14:00.955
Granted, the names were
not exactly the most creative.

14:00.989 --> 14:03.459
[Laughter]

14:03.493 --> 14:05.863
I have no love for he-man.
I just... it's something I...

14:05.898 --> 14:08.131
I know, but I have no love
for he-man either, but he's got

14:08.164 --> 14:10.630
a place in the world
in a comic book store.

14:10.665 --> 14:12.999
You can't make fun
of somebody else's interest.

14:13.033 --> 14:15.500
You're like, "He-Man is stupid.
I like Batman."

14:15.534 --> 14:16.801
You know, what's the diff?
[Laughter]

14:16.836 --> 14:18.804
And what kind of clerk is rude
to customers?

14:18.839 --> 14:20.540
[Laughter]

14:20.575 --> 14:22.507
I, imagine that.

14:22.541 --> 14:25.976
This statue is definitely not
your pappy's He-Man.

14:26.011 --> 14:27.178
Look at that, man.

14:27.212 --> 14:28.781
I don't remember him looking
like this, man.

14:28.815 --> 14:29.816
Pappy's like,
"We didn't have He-Man."

14:29.850 --> 14:30.949
Yeah. [Laughs]

14:30.984 --> 14:32.451
I mean, look at the veins in
his arms.

14:32.485 --> 14:36.325
I mean, this is, like, a He-Man
for the new millennium, man.

14:36.360 --> 14:37.862
I mean, did it take off
in 2002, though?

14:37.897 --> 14:39.329
I mean, kids got into this?

14:39.364 --> 14:41.098
Like, the fuzzy boots
and the, uh...

14:41.132 --> 14:42.799
I mean, I can...
I mean, can you imagine...

14:42.834 --> 14:43.934
look at that loin cloth.

14:43.969 --> 14:45.236
Look at that.

14:45.271 --> 14:46.738
Who knows what weapons he has
in this Fanny pack?

14:46.772 --> 14:47.972
[Laughter]

14:48.006 --> 14:49.672
He's the most powerful man in
the universe.

14:49.706 --> 14:51.373
- You're not into barbarians?
- No.

14:51.407 --> 14:52.607
- What?
- No. I mean, kind of...

14:52.642 --> 14:53.976
you're not into Conan?

14:54.010 --> 14:55.512
- I like Conan.
- What, you think that,

14:55.546 --> 14:57.745
it was He-Man versus Conan,
who wins?

14:57.780 --> 14:58.947
- Oh, Conan, by far.
- You're out of your mind.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.083
- Come on.
- Not a chance, right, bro?

15:00.117 --> 15:01.152
You're out of your mind.

15:01.188 --> 15:02.922
Conan was cool.
He killed people.

15:02.956 --> 15:05.522
He battled people.
He got the women.

15:05.556 --> 15:06.855
That's what it comes down to
for you.

15:06.889 --> 15:08.357
You're like,
"Conan got the women.

15:08.391 --> 15:10.461
- He-Man didn't get the women."
- [Laughs]

15:10.495 --> 15:12.029
Yeah, I don't remember a lot
of women in He-Man.

15:12.063 --> 15:13.227
Didn't he have...
wasn't he married...

15:13.262 --> 15:14.327
- She-Ra.
- Yeah, that's right, She-Ra.

15:14.361 --> 15:15.427
One woman, I mean,
there wasn't a...

15:15.461 --> 15:16.928
that was his sister, too,
which is...

15:16.962 --> 15:18.028
- [laughter]
- Was it really?

15:18.063 --> 15:20.827
Was it really?
[Laughter]

15:20.861 --> 15:23.027
All right, what are
you looking to get for him?

15:23.062 --> 15:24.929
I'm hoping to get around 275.

15:24.963 --> 15:27.735
Ooh.
What's it retail for nowadays?

15:27.769 --> 15:29.604
- 275.
- [Chuckles]

15:29.638 --> 15:30.972
- That's right, I'm asking you...
- That's interesting math.

15:31.006 --> 15:32.237
You know, I'm asking more
than it's...

15:32.272 --> 15:33.604
than... you know.

15:33.639 --> 15:36.575
So, you realize, bringing it
to the comic book store,

15:36.609 --> 15:38.642
we're going to have to try

15:38.677 --> 15:40.110
to make a little bit
of profit on it...

15:40.144 --> 15:43.783
- Right.
- So would you take 125?

15:43.817 --> 15:45.186
Meet me at 200.

15:45.220 --> 15:47.054
- No, I couldn't do 200, man.
- I go... if I drop 75,

15:47.088 --> 15:50.523
you go up 75 from the 125.

15:50.558 --> 15:52.827
I could do 175,
but that is it.

15:52.861 --> 15:54.364
I can't go any higher than that.

15:54.398 --> 15:55.965
- 175 is cool.
- You'll do 175?

15:55.999 --> 15:57.999
- Absolutely.
- All right, deal.

15:59.802 --> 16:01.070
All right, my friend.
Thank you.

16:01.104 --> 16:02.269
All right, guys.

16:02.303 --> 16:03.503
- Have a great afternoon.
- Thanks so much.

16:03.537 --> 16:05.637
Have a good one.

16:06.639 --> 16:08.073
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

16:08.107 --> 16:09.375
You got my Mego yet?

16:09.410 --> 16:11.613
Um, it's on its way.

16:11.647 --> 16:13.783
Okay.
I have a plane to catch.

16:17.512 --> 16:18.813
Can you please try him again?

16:18.847 --> 16:19.983
This is the third text to him,

16:20.017 --> 16:21.319
and the moron's not answering.

16:21.354 --> 16:24.856
- Oh, my God.
- Hi, guys.

16:24.890 --> 16:26.494
- Hi.
- You got my Mego yet?

16:26.529 --> 16:30.000
Um, well, the Mego figure
isn't here yet,

16:30.034 --> 16:31.101
but it's on its way.

16:31.136 --> 16:33.773
'Cause I have
a plane to catch.

16:33.808 --> 16:34.975
Just give us
a few more seconds.

16:35.010 --> 16:36.010
It'll be here.

16:36.045 --> 16:38.016
Okay.

16:38.050 --> 16:39.483
While Ming is out there,
you know,

16:39.517 --> 16:42.051
desperately trying to get back
before Lieutenant Uhura leaves,

16:42.086 --> 16:43.519
all I can think of is, like,

16:43.553 --> 16:45.654
the horrors that would befall
the Stash

16:45.688 --> 16:48.521
as we were the laughingstock
of the comic book community.

16:48.556 --> 16:52.424
Calm down there, Shakespeare.
[Laughter]

16:52.459 --> 16:55.595
- Any second, any second.
- You know what?

16:55.630 --> 16:58.799
I actually had a question
about an urban legend.

16:58.833 --> 17:00.369
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

17:00.403 --> 17:02.204
Is it true Martin Luther King

17:02.239 --> 17:05.040
persuaded you
to not quit Star Trek?

17:05.074 --> 17:07.175
- No, he ordered me.
- Really?

17:07.209 --> 17:08.977
- So it's true?
- [Laughs] Yeah.

17:09.011 --> 17:11.648
We had just met,
and he was saying how

17:11.683 --> 17:14.354
he and his family loved
the show and so forth.

17:14.387 --> 17:16.290
And I said,
"well, I'm leaving the show."

17:16.326 --> 17:20.130
And he said, "you can't!
You cannot."

17:20.165 --> 17:22.698
And I said, "what you talking
'bout, Dr. Martin Luther King?"

17:22.732 --> 17:24.897
[Laughter]

17:24.933 --> 17:26.031
The thing about
Nichelle Nichols is,

17:26.067 --> 17:28.566
she was the first woman of color
who was actually

17:28.601 --> 17:30.867
placed in a prominent position
on television.

17:30.901 --> 17:32.335
There she was, on the bridge.

17:32.369 --> 17:34.905
She was the translator.
She had a big job.

17:34.940 --> 17:36.206
She was part of the crew.

17:36.241 --> 17:37.841
So I can understand where

17:37.875 --> 17:40.245
Martin Luther King
would have felt like,

17:40.279 --> 17:42.477
"Yeah, you're portraying
a character which to you

17:42.512 --> 17:44.647
"could be silly,
but means something more

17:44.681 --> 17:46.951
to the greater good."

17:46.985 --> 17:50.685
I've often wondered
what would have happened to me

17:50.719 --> 17:52.353
if I had left, you know,

17:52.387 --> 17:55.192
and people would be looking
at me like...

17:55.226 --> 17:57.362
[Laughter]

17:57.396 --> 17:58.461
Ticktock.

17:58.496 --> 17:59.761
- Um, yeah, any... anything?
- Tick-tock.

17:59.796 --> 18:02.566
- Okay, you got anything?
- He's... he's...

18:02.601 --> 18:03.567
He says he's on his way.

18:03.601 --> 18:07.235
- Yeah?
- Um...

18:07.269 --> 18:09.035
Hmm.

18:09.070 --> 18:10.371
Um...

18:10.405 --> 18:11.373
- Oh, hey, Ming!
- I got it!

18:11.408 --> 18:12.476
- I got it.
- All right!

18:12.510 --> 18:13.544
I'm so sorry
for making you wait.

18:13.578 --> 18:14.778
- Oh!
- Why'd you make me wait?

18:14.813 --> 18:15.879
- You know.
- 'Cause... I...

18:15.913 --> 18:17.646
- there it is.
- Oh, that's just...

18:17.680 --> 18:19.414
the Mego
Lieutenant Uhura figure.

18:19.448 --> 18:20.450
- Oh!
- Great job, buddy.

18:20.485 --> 18:22.287
- Is that to die for?
- Thank you.

18:22.321 --> 18:23.688
- Thank you.
- Sorry it took so long. God!

18:23.723 --> 18:25.422
- I see...
- It's not nearly as beautiful

18:25.456 --> 18:27.222
- as you are.
- She wishes.

18:27.256 --> 18:30.057
[Laughter]

18:30.091 --> 18:32.730
See, Ming does not believe in
the unwinnable scenario, man.

18:32.765 --> 18:35.199
You broke the Kobayashi Maru,
dude.

18:35.234 --> 18:37.438
I did, I won.
I won!

18:37.472 --> 18:38.941
Oh, that is so cool.

18:38.975 --> 18:40.609
What do you think?
Is that like it came off

18:40.643 --> 18:42.541
- the shelf yesterday?
- Really.

18:42.576 --> 18:44.845
I'm so happy we could, you
know, find it for you today.

18:44.879 --> 18:47.986
Normally I would sell that
for $175,

18:48.020 --> 18:49.589
- but since it's you...
- Yes.

18:49.623 --> 18:52.726
I'm gonna let it go today
for 150.

18:52.760 --> 18:56.297
150?
But it's me.

18:56.332 --> 18:59.032
I have to pay for my own?

18:59.067 --> 19:02.000
Uh... All right.

19:02.034 --> 19:04.204
Well, how about 100 then?

19:04.238 --> 19:07.042
100?
Is that... is that cool?

19:07.077 --> 19:08.477
Doesn't look cool.

19:08.511 --> 19:09.779
It never occurs to you
to be, like,

19:09.813 --> 19:12.082
"for all the years of enjoyment
in space you gave us,

19:12.116 --> 19:13.217
we got this one."

19:13.251 --> 19:14.218
How long have you known him?
[Laughter]

19:14.252 --> 19:15.720
- I know!
- How long?

19:15.755 --> 19:17.023
I have to admit,
I was cringing.

19:17.057 --> 19:18.591
I mean, how could you try
to bargain with her?

19:18.625 --> 19:19.926
I mean, you're trying
to negotiate with her...

19:19.960 --> 19:21.527
that's what we're there for,
though, man.

19:21.561 --> 19:22.894
We're there to make money,
though.

19:22.928 --> 19:26.298
He was just looking to
transport money from her pocket,

19:26.333 --> 19:28.066
beam it into his.
[Laughter]

19:28.100 --> 19:29.299
That simple.

19:29.333 --> 19:30.499
How about 75 then?

19:30.534 --> 19:34.837
75, and everything's
still copacetic?

19:34.871 --> 19:36.973
That's... that's a great deal.

19:37.007 --> 19:39.343
- What if I gifted it to her?
- You would buy it for her?

19:39.378 --> 19:40.578
- Aha!
- On one condition, though.

19:40.612 --> 19:44.615
We reenact the first
interracial kiss.

19:44.649 --> 19:46.920
Me and you.
[Laughter]

19:55.891 --> 19:59.259
Suddenly, she's not
so interested, I think, anymore.

19:59.293 --> 20:00.694
- Ooh, look at this!
- Whoa!

20:00.728 --> 20:02.295
- No way!
- No.

20:02.330 --> 20:03.299
Mike, I'm about to kiss
your girlfriend.

20:03.333 --> 20:05.103
- [Laughter]
- Son of a bitch.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.204
- I always want...
- Look at this!

20:06.239 --> 20:09.341
I can't resist
a man with a beard.

20:09.376 --> 20:10.342
- Oh!
- Mm.

20:10.377 --> 20:11.679
- Ooh!
- Ooh.

20:11.713 --> 20:12.814
Thank you.

20:12.849 --> 20:13.949
I'll even go full-price
for that.

20:13.984 --> 20:15.584
- Thank you.
- Nice!

20:15.618 --> 20:18.086
- Whoo!
- No way.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.086
One more.

20:19.120 --> 20:21.491
- Oh!
- No way!

20:21.525 --> 20:23.959
- [Laughter]
- Have a great day.

20:23.993 --> 20:26.193
Thank you, guys.
Bye-bye.

20:26.227 --> 20:27.595
How does that happen?

20:27.629 --> 20:29.633
I'm stunned.

20:29.668 --> 20:31.702
Now that you've kissed Uhura,

20:31.736 --> 20:35.501
you just have to kiss Kirk,
Spock, Sulu, and Chekov,

20:35.535 --> 20:38.171
and you'll have them all.
And Scotty, for a bonus round.

20:38.205 --> 20:39.338
I probably got
a chance with Sulu.

20:39.373 --> 20:40.807
The rest of the guys,
I don't know.

20:40.841 --> 20:42.378
[Laughter]

20:42.412 --> 20:43.581
And that's it.

20:43.616 --> 20:46.351
Everything that starts
eventually ends, kids,

20:46.386 --> 20:48.453
just like this show,
unfortunately.

20:48.488 --> 20:50.622
For Comic Book Men,
I'm Kevin Smith.

20:50.657 --> 20:52.490
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:52.524 --> 20:53.791
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:53.825 --> 20:57.625
Other generations had
"George Washington slept here."

20:57.660 --> 21:00.929
Our generation has
"Lieutenant Uhura shopped here."

21:00.963 --> 21:03.330
[Laughter]
Good night!
