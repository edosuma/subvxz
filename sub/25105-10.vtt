on "Reverie"...</i>

00:38.640 --> 00:39.675
<i>Dylan is...</i>

00:39.711 --> 00:40.874
He's the building's AI.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.008
<i>Hello, Miss Kint.</i>

00:42.044 --> 00:43.543
<i>Dylan was her twin brother.</i>

00:43.579 --> 00:45.112
Must've been about
10 or 11 when he died.

00:45.148 --> 00:47.715
Ventana was suspicious.
Nearly didn't get past him.

00:47.751 --> 00:49.684
- <i>What is that thing, anyway?</i>
- <i>It's a security key.</i>

00:49.720 --> 00:51.752
<i>Provides access to
the program's source code.</i>

00:51.788 --> 00:52.620
Fix the program.

00:52.656 --> 00:53.755
Fix the program?

00:53.791 --> 00:55.757
You don't even
understand it.

00:55.793 --> 00:57.526
At least I didn't
kill my brother.

00:57.562 --> 00:58.895
<i>I know it's a bad time,</i>

00:58.931 --> 01:01.664
<i>but I have to go
to my parents' house.</i>

01:01.700 --> 01:03.499
My voicemail
recorded everything

01:03.535 --> 01:05.135
your phone transmitted
from the apartment.

01:05.171 --> 01:07.104
<i>You can be with her right now,</i>

01:07.140 --> 01:09.040
if that's what
you really want.

01:09.076 --> 01:11.109
It's okay.

01:11.145 --> 01:12.477
You were right.

01:12.513 --> 01:13.545
The program
has uncovered something,

01:13.581 --> 01:14.713
something that was buried.

01:14.749 --> 01:16.182
<i>Even I didn't know
it was there.</i>

01:16.218 --> 01:17.483
It'll take a while
to render.

01:17.519 --> 01:18.484
You'll know when it's ready.

01:18.520 --> 01:19.552
You'll see the door.

<i>Apertus.</i>

01:22.959 --> 01:24.928
Hello, Ray.

01:30.267 --> 01:32.201
I've had
the strangest dreams.

01:34.505 --> 01:37.140
And this...
feels different.

01:37.176 --> 01:38.774
That's because
it's not a dream, Ray.

01:38.810 --> 01:41.678
It's a virtual reality program
called Reverie.

01:41.714 --> 01:43.046
How are you here?

01:43.082 --> 01:45.082
I work for the company
that created the program.

01:45.118 --> 01:47.551
- I brought you here.
- Why?

01:47.587 --> 01:49.154
Because I have questions.

01:49.190 --> 01:50.588
Questions about what?

01:53.628 --> 01:55.128
I know you know
what happened that day.

01:57.632 --> 01:59.565
Talking about them
isn't gonna change anything.

01:59.601 --> 02:00.533
It's not going to
bring them back.

02:00.569 --> 02:01.534
I know that.

02:01.570 --> 02:03.070
Then why are you here?

02:03.106 --> 02:05.639
Because I want to understand.

Well, good!

02:22.628 --> 02:24.127
You're just in time.

02:24.163 --> 02:25.196
Oh!

02:26.599 --> 02:28.132
Happy birthday.

02:28.168 --> 02:29.600
Thanks.

02:29.636 --> 02:31.270
First things first:
hand it over.

02:31.306 --> 02:32.704
Mom.

02:32.740 --> 02:34.606
- Rules are rules.
- Oh, come on.

02:34.642 --> 02:37.012
You can forget about work
for one evening.

02:39.215 --> 02:42.183
I'll reveal its secret location
at the appropriate time.

02:46.690 --> 02:49.057
Did you put up more?

02:49.093 --> 02:50.959
A new one just today.

02:50.995 --> 02:53.895
- "Visionary."
- Mom, you have to stop.

02:53.931 --> 02:57.300
I'm gonna
put them in the stairwell next.

02:57.336 --> 02:59.938
Come on.
You can help me set the table.

03:21.030 --> 03:23.800
I can't force you
to talk to me, Ray.

03:27.704 --> 03:32.207
You can either
answer my questions or not.

03:32.243 --> 03:35.311
Okay.

03:35.347 --> 03:37.679
Wait.

03:42.755 --> 03:44.955
What do you want to know?

03:46.259 --> 03:48.060
Not here.

04:10.754 --> 04:13.024
- Ray, please!
- Mommy!

04:17.829 --> 04:22.265
Where are the pictures?

04:22.301 --> 04:23.434
We didn't have time for that.

04:23.470 --> 04:26.106
We?

04:29.310 --> 04:33.245
A friend of mine from work.

04:33.281 --> 04:35.381
Helped set everything up.

04:35.417 --> 04:37.717
Well, here we are.

04:37.753 --> 04:39.953
How do we start?

04:39.989 --> 04:42.056
The question that I have,

04:42.092 --> 04:45.092
the thing that I keep
asking myself is why.

04:45.128 --> 04:47.063
Why did you do it?

04:49.500 --> 04:51.733
I got fired,

04:51.769 --> 04:54.437
and I was ashamed,
and I was embarrassed.

04:54.473 --> 04:56.172
And you didn't tell her.

04:56.208 --> 04:57.441
I figured I would

04:57.477 --> 04:59.209
be back at work
before the end of the week,

04:59.245 --> 05:01.178
on some other crew,
but that was not the case,

05:01.214 --> 05:03.481
and we were already behind
on a few bills,

05:03.517 --> 05:05.048
and then they shut
the electric off,

05:05.084 --> 05:06.918
and Jamie called my foreman,
looking for me,

05:06.954 --> 05:08.786
and that's how she found out.

05:08.822 --> 05:09.954
And then I come home,

05:09.990 --> 05:11.823
and there's
these two suitcases

05:11.859 --> 05:13.459
in the hallway by the door.

05:13.495 --> 05:15.027
She was gonna leave.

05:15.063 --> 05:17.230
And she texted your mom
to come pick them up,

05:17.266 --> 05:19.733
and I just felt like everything
was slipping through my hands.

05:19.769 --> 05:20.800
What happened after that?

05:22.872 --> 05:25.306
- It's just a blur.
- No, think, Ray.

05:25.342 --> 05:26.475
Why did you go
for the gun?

05:26.511 --> 05:27.909
- I don't know.
- You do know!

05:27.945 --> 05:29.945
I was begging her.

05:29.981 --> 05:33.316
I was begging her
just to stop and talk,

05:33.352 --> 05:35.218
but she wouldn't listen.

05:35.254 --> 05:37.954
It was like I had no...

05:37.990 --> 05:41.194
- No... No what?
- No power.

05:44.532 --> 05:46.364
And the gun gave you power?

05:46.400 --> 05:48.400
It gave me control.

05:48.436 --> 05:50.969
It made her stop
and pay attention,

05:51.005 --> 05:52.171
and then you showed up,

05:52.207 --> 05:53.772
and then the police showed up,
and I knew

05:53.808 --> 05:56.976
I was never gonna have
my family again,

05:57.012 --> 06:00.147
and I just got
this one thought.

06:00.183 --> 06:02.550
What thought?

06:02.586 --> 06:05.889
That we'd all
be better off dead.

06:07.558 --> 06:09.924
You had no right.

06:09.960 --> 06:13.798
You had no right
to decide that for them.

06:21.907 --> 06:23.808
This is from...

06:23.844 --> 06:25.076
Redmond.

06:25.112 --> 06:26.944
- When I showed them...
- That's right.

06:26.980 --> 06:29.281
When you were
showing them your robot.

06:29.317 --> 06:30.582
Mom, it's not a robot.

06:30.618 --> 06:32.017
And this is when
you went to State.

06:32.053 --> 06:35.822
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

06:35.858 --> 06:38.324

06:48.939 --> 06:51.276
Is everything okay?

06:54.246 --> 06:57.113
Why don't you ever
put his name on the cake?

06:57.149 --> 06:58.482
What?

06:58.518 --> 07:01.018
Dylan.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.354
Why don't you ever
put his name on the cake?

07:03.390 --> 07:05.523
It's his birthday too.

07:05.559 --> 07:06.524
Lexie...

07:06.560 --> 07:08.226
And why are there, like,

07:08.262 --> 07:12.398
500 photos of me in here
and only one of him?

07:12.434 --> 07:14.933
And it's not a robot.

07:14.969 --> 07:18.938
Mom, it's
an artificial intelligence,

07:18.974 --> 07:21.409
and sometimes,
it is just like talking to him,

07:21.445 --> 07:24.646
but you wouldn't know that,
because you've never tried it.

07:24.682 --> 07:26.180
Where is this coming from?

07:26.216 --> 07:28.583
Do you just want
to forget about him?

07:28.619 --> 07:30.553
Because I don't.

07:30.589 --> 07:34.123
We could never forget.

07:34.159 --> 07:37.093
No parent ever could.

07:37.129 --> 07:39.263
We think about him
every single day,

07:39.299 --> 07:41.932
and we miss him
just as much as you do.

07:41.968 --> 07:43.668
Then why don't you
at least try...

07:43.704 --> 07:46.338
'Cause that computer
is not my son,

07:46.374 --> 07:49.274
and it never will be.

07:49.310 --> 07:50.975
I built him

07:51.011 --> 07:55.081
so we didn't have to
lose him for good,

07:55.117 --> 07:56.982
and you won't even
acknowledge that,

07:57.018 --> 08:00.420
or even say his name since...

08:00.456 --> 08:03.358
What did you want us
to do, Lexie?

08:03.394 --> 08:05.293
We had a kid to raise.

08:05.329 --> 08:07.195
We didn't want you
to feel any more...

08:07.231 --> 08:09.200
Don't.

08:13.304 --> 08:14.973
Say it.

08:18.712 --> 08:21.212
We didn't want you to feel

08:21.248 --> 08:23.948
any more guilty
than you already did.

08:23.984 --> 08:25.617
Lexie, what she means is

08:25.653 --> 08:27.953
we knew that you were special.

08:27.989 --> 08:30.155
We didn't want to
derail you in any way,

08:30.191 --> 08:33.294
so we did what we had to do
to keep moving forward.

08:35.230 --> 08:38.599
But we didn't.

08:38.635 --> 08:41.438
Any of us.

08:52.551 --> 08:54.584
<i>Lexie, let me in!</i>

08:56.355 --> 08:57.721
Lexie!

08:57.757 --> 09:00.026
Ugh.

09:13.642 --> 09:15.141
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

09:15.177 --> 09:17.279
Shh, shh, shh.

09:20.417 --> 09:23.518
Do you remember what happened
after you killed them?

09:26.124 --> 09:28.691
I remember putting a gun
to my head.

09:28.727 --> 09:33.096
I remember you were there.

09:33.132 --> 09:34.598
And then it's a blur.

09:34.634 --> 09:38.736
There's a lot
I don't remember anymore.

09:38.772 --> 09:40.738
I remember.

09:40.774 --> 09:42.574
Ray! Ray!

09:42.610 --> 09:43.842
Coming around the corner...

09:46.614 --> 09:50.516
I remember seeing them

09:50.552 --> 09:52.585
<i>on the floor,</i>

09:52.621 --> 09:54.588
and then I remember

09:54.624 --> 09:58.059
you holding a gun
to your head.

09:58.095 --> 10:01.162
So I made you do it.

10:01.198 --> 10:02.230
Do what?

10:03.534 --> 10:06.702
Pull the trigger.

10:06.738 --> 10:10.807
That's not how it happened.

10:10.843 --> 10:11.808
No, I heard...

10:11.844 --> 10:12.809
I heard the recording.

10:12.845 --> 10:13.877
Mara, what I'm saying is

10:13.913 --> 10:15.913
you didn't make me do anything.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.716
You just gave me permission.

10:18.752 --> 10:21.086
I wanted to die.
I still do.

10:21.122 --> 10:23.155
And I keep having this dream,
like, a hundred times,

10:23.191 --> 10:25.024
of Jamie and Brynn,
and I'm running after them.

10:25.060 --> 10:26.926
I'm trying to tell them
how sorry I am,

10:26.962 --> 10:28.862
how I never meant
to hurt them,

10:28.898 --> 10:30.730
and I can never see
their faces.

10:30.766 --> 10:31.998
It's like the longer
it goes on,

10:32.034 --> 10:33.800
the more things
just fade away.

10:33.836 --> 10:36.203
That's why I was looking
for the pictures on the wall,

10:36.239 --> 10:39.507
'cause I can't remember
what they look like.

10:39.543 --> 10:41.944
I don't blame you
for what you did.

10:41.980 --> 10:46.849
I deserve everything I got.

10:51.824 --> 10:53.824
You're back.
We have to go, now.

10:53.860 --> 10:55.092
Why?
What's going on?

10:55.128 --> 10:58.063
It's Alexis.
She's gone missing.

10:58.099 --> 11:01.232
Mrs. Barrett,
I wouldn't worry.

11:01.268 --> 11:02.701
I'm sure she'll be fine.

11:02.737 --> 11:04.602
Give us a call
if you hear from her.

11:04.638 --> 11:06.706
No sign of her yet?

11:06.742 --> 11:07.873
No.

11:07.909 --> 11:09.876
However,
I had Dylan do a search

11:09.912 --> 11:12.012
of the security cameras
in the neighborhood.

11:12.048 --> 11:14.081
We didn't find Alexis,
but we found this.

11:18.989 --> 11:20.021
Oliver.

11:20.057 --> 11:21.689
He was in
a gas station nearby

11:21.725 --> 11:23.559
a couple of hours
before she disappeared.

11:23.595 --> 11:24.693
We have to call the police.

11:24.729 --> 11:25.928
- I already did that.
- And?

11:25.964 --> 11:27.030
They're doing
everything they can,

11:27.066 --> 11:28.597
but they
have to follow protocol.

11:28.633 --> 11:30.100
Takes time.

11:30.136 --> 11:31.701
So what, we're just
supposed to sit here and wait?

11:31.737 --> 11:33.804
I have no intention
of doing that.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.272
Where are you going?

11:35.308 --> 11:38.243
To the bastard's apartment.

11:38.279 --> 11:40.112
I want you to dig up
everything you can

11:40.148 --> 11:43.682
on Reveries connected to
employee number 002.

11:43.718 --> 11:44.916
Is that Oliver Hill?

11:44.952 --> 11:46.119
Is this about
what happened to Alexis?

11:46.155 --> 11:47.887
What do you know
about Alexis?

11:47.923 --> 11:48.988
Nothing.
It's just, normally,

11:49.024 --> 11:50.290
she's logged onto the server,

11:50.326 --> 11:53.027
making changes to the code,
like, 24/7.

11:53.063 --> 11:55.263
I'm not even sure she sleeps.

11:55.299 --> 11:58.933
But today, she hasn't logged on
for over five hours,

11:58.969 --> 12:00.935
so clearly something's...
well, that's weird.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.271
She just went into Reverie.

12:02.307 --> 12:04.240
Dylan, can you tell me
if she's in one of ours?

12:04.276 --> 12:07.344
<i>It's one of our servers,
but it's marked inactive.</i>

12:07.380 --> 12:09.079
What the hell is she doing?

12:14.687 --> 12:16.721
Do you remember
this place?

12:16.757 --> 12:18.823
Einstein's secret lab.

12:18.859 --> 12:20.959
Hidden in the tunnels
underneath this college.

12:20.995 --> 12:22.294
It's not a bad likeness, is it?

12:22.330 --> 12:23.729
You induced a Reverie.

12:23.765 --> 12:24.963
Nifty little trick

12:24.999 --> 12:27.300
I learned from your work
with Monica Shaw.

12:27.336 --> 12:28.301
I'm curious.

12:28.337 --> 12:29.936
Did you at least

12:29.972 --> 12:32.039
pretend to be morally outraged

12:32.075 --> 12:34.108
at the idea of forcing someone
into Reverie,

12:34.144 --> 12:38.313
or was your brain simply
working on solving the problem?

12:38.349 --> 12:39.414
<i>Exitus.</i>

12:39.450 --> 12:40.849
Ooh, another trick

12:40.885 --> 12:43.051
I learned from the DoD.

12:43.087 --> 12:47.824
Coded to my voice
and my voice alone.

12:47.860 --> 12:50.230
That's not gonna work either.

12:52.899 --> 12:54.865
Why am I here?

12:54.901 --> 12:56.201
Do you remember
why I picked this place

12:56.237 --> 12:57.869
for our first date?

12:57.905 --> 13:00.939
Because you were supposed to be
the next Einstein.

13:00.975 --> 13:02.975
Funny thing about Albert:

13:03.011 --> 13:04.777
he always said

13:04.813 --> 13:07.447
that he had one big regret.

13:07.483 --> 13:08.915
He helped build the bomb

13:08.951 --> 13:10.050
that killed hundreds

13:10.086 --> 13:13.955
of thousands of people.

13:13.991 --> 13:18.293
Not gonna let you
make the same mistake.

13:18.329 --> 13:20.262
What are you gonna do?

13:20.298 --> 13:21.964
You gonna kill me?

13:22.000 --> 13:23.866
Is that what you think?

13:23.902 --> 13:24.867
Alexis,

13:24.903 --> 13:28.838
I would never hurt you.

13:28.874 --> 13:30.740
I couldn't.

13:30.776 --> 13:31.942
But I am gonna keep you here

13:31.978 --> 13:34.044
until I help you
solve the problem.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.380
What does that mean?

13:35.416 --> 13:38.049
People are getting stuck
in Reverie.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.751
I've had
massive derealizations,

13:39.787 --> 13:41.119
Mara Kint is worse off
than I am,

13:41.155 --> 13:44.157
and now... the military
has its hands on it.

13:44.193 --> 13:47.461
I'm sorry, but this
has gone too far,

13:47.497 --> 13:49.363
and it all ends tonight.

13:49.399 --> 13:52.966
They're gonna find me
in here.

13:53.002 --> 13:54.134
It won't matter,

13:54.170 --> 13:55.769
because by the time
they get you out,

13:55.805 --> 13:56.905
it will be too late.

13:56.941 --> 13:58.507
- Oliver...
- <i>Exitus.</i>

13:58.543 --> 13:59.741
Oliver!

13:59.777 --> 14:01.446
Oliver!

14:03.481 --> 14:05.482
Oliver!

14:05.518 --> 14:06.516
How's it going?

14:06.552 --> 14:07.750
Almost there.

14:07.786 --> 14:09.119
Keep your fingers crossed.

14:09.155 --> 14:10.454
This computer was
the only thing left

14:10.490 --> 14:11.922
in Oliver's apartment.

14:11.958 --> 14:13.291
This doesn't work,
we're back to square one.

14:13.327 --> 14:14.859
- Got her.
- Can you get into her Reverie?

14:14.895 --> 14:16.827
Pairing a tablet right now.

14:16.863 --> 14:18.029
I'll go in.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.298
After all
you've been through?

14:19.334 --> 14:21.166
Okay, guys, this is not
up for debate.

14:21.202 --> 14:23.035
I'll go in, I'll find her,
I'll get her real location,

14:23.071 --> 14:25.307
then I'll come out.
End of discussion.

14:31.314 --> 14:33.180
<i>Apertus.</i>

14:52.839 --> 14:55.042
That was new.

14:57.444 --> 15:00.079
Alexis?

15:04.620 --> 15:08.288
Casey!

15:08.324 --> 15:10.090
It's a really bad time
to shut down

15:10.126 --> 15:11.158
the air conditioning.
Who ordered this?

15:11.194 --> 15:12.826
Right, I just saw that, too.

15:12.862 --> 15:13.861
It was Alexis.

15:13.897 --> 15:17.064
But Alexis is still in...

15:17.100 --> 15:18.433
- Dylan?
- <i>Yes, Paul?</i>

15:18.469 --> 15:20.535
I think Oliver Hill
has Alexis' security key.

15:20.571 --> 15:22.971
If I'm right, that means that
he has access to everything.

15:23.007 --> 15:24.274
Not just the Reverie code,

15:24.310 --> 15:25.608
but the building's
support systems as well.

15:25.644 --> 15:27.176
Can you restart
the air conditioning?

15:27.212 --> 15:28.612
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

15:28.648 --> 15:30.347
<i>Whoever has the key
just locked me out.</i>

15:30.383 --> 15:32.116
He's trying to
overheat our servers

15:32.152 --> 15:33.551
- and crash the program.
- Why would he do that?

15:33.587 --> 15:36.187
If Reverie goes down,
he can screw up the brains

15:36.223 --> 15:38.125
of the 15,000 people
still in there.

15:40.978 --> 15:42.714
Alexis?

15:51.866 --> 15:54.036
Alexis?

16:00.911 --> 16:03.114
Hello?

16:05.796 --> 16:07.965
Alexis?

16:34.335 --> 16:36.872
Alexis?

16:49.319 --> 16:51.254
Hello?

16:58.945 --> 17:01.846
Okay.

17:01.882 --> 17:03.583
Note to self.

17:16.699 --> 17:19.066
<i>Where do you want me
to start, Charlie?</i>

17:19.102 --> 17:21.667
We're going on a deep dive
into Oliver Hill.

17:21.704 --> 17:24.039
I want you to dig up
everything you can.

17:24.075 --> 17:26.775
Uh, known family, friends,
associates,

17:26.810 --> 17:28.811
addresses, phone numbers.

17:28.847 --> 17:30.380
Anywhere he may have checked in

17:30.416 --> 17:34.117
or tagged himself
on social media lately.

17:34.153 --> 17:35.819
Am I late to the party?

17:35.855 --> 17:37.188
I'm sorry to call on you
like this,

17:37.224 --> 17:38.688
but I needed someone
I could trust,

17:38.724 --> 17:39.724
someone resourceful.

17:39.760 --> 17:40.792
Glad I could help.

17:40.828 --> 17:42.026
Dylan, I'm going to give you

17:42.062 --> 17:43.628
a couple of new toys.

17:43.664 --> 17:45.297
Access to a network
of cell phone towers,

17:45.333 --> 17:49.335
plus red light
and traffic cameras.

17:49.371 --> 17:51.004
Alexis?

17:51.040 --> 17:53.008
Mara?

17:54.977 --> 17:57.711
Alexis! I'm here!

17:57.747 --> 17:59.414
How do I know
you're not an avatar?

17:59.450 --> 18:00.714
Um...

18:00.750 --> 18:01.849
The first day
that I came to work,

18:01.885 --> 18:03.185
you offered me

18:03.221 --> 18:05.654
some horrible drink
that you'd concocted

18:05.690 --> 18:07.056
just so you could cut down
the amount of time

18:07.092 --> 18:08.224
you spent thinking about food.

18:08.260 --> 18:10.259
It was called a slurry.

18:10.295 --> 18:13.729
What did you say
it tasted like?

18:13.765 --> 18:14.798
Efficiency!

18:14.834 --> 18:16.100
Yes!

18:16.136 --> 18:17.768
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

18:19.340 --> 18:21.239
I can't get it open
from in here, either,

18:21.275 --> 18:22.740
and it's the only way out.

18:22.776 --> 18:25.144
Mara, he's going to destroy
the Reverie program.

18:25.180 --> 18:26.378
You need to forget about me.

18:26.414 --> 18:29.048
Go find the mandala
and tell Charlie.

18:29.084 --> 18:30.283
Well, Charlie's
looking for him right now

18:30.319 --> 18:32.419
as we speak,
but I'm not leaving

18:32.455 --> 18:36.357
until I get you
out of this room, Alexis.

18:36.393 --> 18:38.860
Okay, you built this program

18:38.896 --> 18:41.430
to respond to
whatever it is that we want.

18:41.466 --> 18:42.763
Right?

18:42.799 --> 18:44.166
Yeah.

18:44.202 --> 18:47.303
So if we really, really
want this door to open,

18:47.339 --> 18:49.939
shouldn't we be able
to just turn the knob?

18:49.975 --> 18:51.808
No, it... it doesn't
work like that.

18:51.844 --> 18:52.976
It's not magic.

18:53.012 --> 18:54.445
We have to meet
the program halfway.

18:54.481 --> 18:56.780
We have to give it
something to work off of,

18:56.816 --> 18:59.351
something that sparks
your sense memory

18:59.387 --> 19:01.853
- of unlocking the door.
- Like a key.

19:01.889 --> 19:03.455
Theoretically, yes,

19:03.491 --> 19:06.959
but it would have to be
something like...

19:06.995 --> 19:09.298
Hang on!

19:11.099 --> 19:13.436
Try this.

19:18.342 --> 19:20.441
So I just put this in
and turn it?

19:20.477 --> 19:22.210
This is something you've done

19:22.246 --> 19:24.180
thousands and thousands
of times in your life.

19:24.216 --> 19:25.747
You know, on a deep level,

19:25.783 --> 19:27.416
what it feels like
when you put the key

19:27.452 --> 19:29.018
into the lock
of your front door.

19:29.054 --> 19:30.287
So...

19:30.323 --> 19:32.289
just remember
what that feels like

19:32.325 --> 19:34.894
as the key slides
into the mechanism.

19:58.255 --> 20:01.122
I 98% did not
expect that to work.

20:02.226 --> 20:03.391
What's that?

20:03.427 --> 20:06.262
I've never seen that before.

20:06.298 --> 20:08.197
We should find that mandala,

20:08.233 --> 20:10.436
and soon.

20:12.405 --> 20:14.137
<i>There's no
social media footprint</i>

20:14.173 --> 20:17.141
<i>for Oliver after Onira-Tech,
and not much before.</i>

20:17.177 --> 20:20.411
<i>I found his school picture
after he moved to the U.S.,</i>

20:20.447 --> 20:22.146
<i>but there's no record
of his time there.</i>

20:22.182 --> 20:24.883
<i>Maybe the records
were destroyed in the fire.</i>

20:24.919 --> 20:26.352
What's that group pic?

20:26.388 --> 20:28.153
<i>"Future Trailblazers,
for gifted students."</i>

20:28.189 --> 20:29.556
And that cabin?

20:29.592 --> 20:33.026
<i>It's geotagged,
near Mount Wilson.</i>

20:33.062 --> 20:35.496
We had Dylan cross-reference
Oliver's cell phone

20:35.532 --> 20:37.231
with the towers
at the base of Angeles Crest,

20:37.267 --> 20:38.866
leading up to Mount Wilson.

20:38.902 --> 20:40.569
We got a dozen hits
over the last few weeks,

20:40.605 --> 20:43.005
and he was spotted on two red
light cameras in Altadena.

20:43.041 --> 20:44.273
Alexis may be up there.

20:44.309 --> 20:46.309
We'll call you
if we find anything.

20:46.345 --> 20:47.477
Status update?

20:47.513 --> 20:48.945
Three server meltdowns
so far.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.313
How many people
still in the program?

20:50.349 --> 20:51.914
Um, more now.

20:51.950 --> 20:53.217
Over 16,000.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.885
Okay, everybody, listen up!

20:54.921 --> 20:55.819
We are under attack.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.589
Someone is trying
to overheat our servers

20:57.625 --> 20:59.457
and crash the Reverie program.

20:59.493 --> 21:01.092
We need all hands on deck

21:01.128 --> 21:03.295
opening up windows and doors
for the floor racks

21:03.331 --> 21:04.996
and moving fans
to the data center.

21:05.032 --> 21:06.299
Casey, get a team together.

21:06.335 --> 21:08.468
Disable all usernames
and passwords.

21:08.504 --> 21:10.237
Nobody else gets into Reverie.

21:10.273 --> 21:12.172
Come on, let's go!

21:35.062 --> 21:36.465
Anything?

21:38.223 --> 21:39.788
There has to be one, right?

21:39.824 --> 21:41.690
I mean, he couldn't just
not put one in.

21:41.726 --> 21:44.260
The exit mandala is one of
the only mandatory components

21:44.296 --> 21:45.261
of the build.

21:45.297 --> 21:46.562
You can choose the location,

21:46.598 --> 21:47.630
but it has to go somewhere.

21:47.666 --> 21:50.767
He just... hid it really well.

21:52.305 --> 21:53.738
What the hell?

21:55.876 --> 21:58.710
Did he put them in there
to scare you?

21:58.746 --> 21:59.578
Not on purpose.

21:59.614 --> 22:00.812
I don't understand.

22:00.848 --> 22:03.049
Oliver told you
about his derealization.

22:03.085 --> 22:05.351
That is what he was seeing.

22:05.387 --> 22:06.786
His disorder causes

22:06.822 --> 22:09.156
these incredibly powerful
hallucinations.

22:09.192 --> 22:11.125
Sometimes,
when he was in Reverie,

22:11.161 --> 22:12.626
they would manifest themselves

22:12.662 --> 22:13.761
as avatars,

22:13.797 --> 22:15.130
thanks to the BCI.

22:15.166 --> 22:16.931
He spent years

22:16.967 --> 22:18.133
trying to explain to people

22:18.169 --> 22:20.202
what it was like
living inside his brain.

22:20.238 --> 22:22.974
Because of Reverie,
he was able to show me.

22:34.121 --> 22:35.889
I know that sound.

22:38.927 --> 22:39.958
Can I help you?

22:39.994 --> 22:41.727
Yeah, here to fix the AC.

22:41.763 --> 22:43.896
- Where's, uh, everybody else?
- Just me for the moment.

22:43.932 --> 22:45.331
Well, they told me
to send everyone back upstairs.

22:45.367 --> 22:47.267
I can take it from here.

22:47.303 --> 22:48.968
Roger that.

22:49.004 --> 22:50.941
Cheers.

23:25.114 --> 23:27.316
Alexis, wait.

23:29.986 --> 23:31.252
How could you do it?

23:31.288 --> 23:32.686
He just wanted
to spend some time with you,

23:32.722 --> 23:33.721
but you couldn't do that,
could you?

23:33.757 --> 23:35.089
Because you're too selfish.

23:35.125 --> 23:38.360
Because your little projects
are so important.

23:38.396 --> 23:40.262
What are they talking about?

23:40.298 --> 23:41.464
Dylan.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.099
He was the good twin,
you know.

23:43.135 --> 23:44.968
He was the one people liked.

23:45.004 --> 23:45.969
But you took him away.

23:46.005 --> 23:47.871
You ruined our lives.

23:47.907 --> 23:50.474
Alexis, these aren't
your parents.

23:50.510 --> 23:52.309
You said you didn't blame me.

23:52.345 --> 23:54.312
Of course we blame you.

23:54.348 --> 23:56.815
Alexis,
do you really think

23:56.851 --> 23:59.784
that your parents
feel like this?

23:59.820 --> 24:01.854
- No.
- Neither do I.

24:01.890 --> 24:03.356
Oliver put them here
to hurt you,

24:03.392 --> 24:04.824
to slow you down,
'cause I'm guessing

24:04.860 --> 24:07.294
the mandala's
just beyond that door.

24:07.330 --> 24:09.963
It just feels so...

24:09.999 --> 24:12.933
Real?

24:12.969 --> 24:14.402
But it's not.

24:14.438 --> 24:17.342
You know that
more than anybody.

24:50.947 --> 24:53.116
Another one
of Oliver's hallucinations?

24:55.353 --> 24:58.153
He didn't create this.

24:58.189 --> 25:00.359
I did.

25:30.193 --> 25:32.095
I got her.

25:32.996 --> 25:35.029
It was the only time
spontaneous generation

25:35.065 --> 25:37.065
happened for me.

25:37.101 --> 25:38.133
Paul discovered a room

25:38.169 --> 25:39.469
that it had built
in his Reverie.

25:39.505 --> 25:41.971
The room with his dad.

25:42.007 --> 25:44.140
We started exploring
the idea that

25:44.176 --> 25:46.843
if it could tap into
your greatest desires...

25:46.879 --> 25:49.980
It could also tap into
your fears.

25:50.016 --> 25:52.384
This is what
it created from mine.

25:52.420 --> 25:54.586
My fear was that
I hadn't created something

25:54.622 --> 25:56.855
that would bring
people together after all.

25:56.891 --> 25:58.123
Maybe I had created

25:58.159 --> 25:59.392
something that would
destroy us.

25:59.428 --> 26:01.494
He wanted me to see this again.

26:01.530 --> 26:05.198
Well, you've seen it.

26:05.234 --> 26:06.199
Shall we?

26:06.235 --> 26:08.101
What if he's right?

26:08.137 --> 26:11.539
What if I'm ruining
people's lives?

26:11.575 --> 26:13.308
You're not.

26:13.344 --> 26:14.876
Look what happened to you.

26:14.912 --> 26:16.412
I'll tell you
what happened to me.

26:16.448 --> 26:18.113
The day my sister
and my niece were killed,

26:18.149 --> 26:20.550
I told my brother-in-law

26:20.586 --> 26:23.586
to turn the gun on himself.

26:23.622 --> 26:25.288
I was running from the guilt

26:25.324 --> 26:26.457
of not being able
to save my family,

26:26.493 --> 26:27.591
but the truth was

26:27.627 --> 26:31.162
so much more
complicated than that.

26:31.198 --> 26:33.197
And today, Reverie

26:33.233 --> 26:36.501
gave me the chance
to deal with it face-to-face.

26:36.537 --> 26:39.941
Alexis, you told me...

26:41.210 --> 26:45.412
that Reverie was a gift,

26:45.448 --> 26:48.649
and I think you're right.

26:48.685 --> 26:52.320
It's a gift worth saving.

26:52.356 --> 26:56.157
And if you believe that too,
then I think we should

26:56.193 --> 26:58.896
really get going.

27:16.484 --> 27:20.420
Charlie...

27:20.456 --> 27:23.092
Oh, welcome back, kid.

27:25.995 --> 27:27.328
I'll let her know.

27:27.364 --> 27:28.996
We're on our way back now.

27:29.032 --> 27:32.299
Mara's out.

27:32.335 --> 27:34.102
Charlie.

27:34.138 --> 27:37.439
What is it?

27:37.475 --> 27:39.409
Iron oxide, aluminum powder.

27:39.445 --> 27:40.643
He was mixing thermite.

27:40.679 --> 27:42.412
Time to call in
the cavalry.

27:42.448 --> 27:44.080
- What's going on?
- We were wrong.

27:44.116 --> 27:45.682
Oliver wasn't planning
a cyber attack.

27:45.718 --> 27:49.022
He's planning
to burn the place down.

27:56.381 --> 27:58.648
- Clearing the last floor.
- Thank you.

27:58.684 --> 28:00.583
- Where is he?
- The data center.

28:00.619 --> 28:01.752
At least, that's where he was

28:01.788 --> 28:03.354
when the security cameras
went down.

28:03.390 --> 28:04.855
Could you see
what he was doing?

28:04.891 --> 28:06.423
All we know is he was able
to roll in a utility cart.

28:06.459 --> 28:07.826
Yeah, loaded
with thermite, I'm sure.

28:07.862 --> 28:09.461
Say he burns it down.
Don't you have backups?

28:09.497 --> 28:10.629
The backups
are still in-house.

28:10.665 --> 28:12.098
Literally melting
the data center...

28:12.134 --> 28:13.599
that's permanent.

28:13.635 --> 28:16.135
Reverie, Dylan...
It all goes away.

28:16.171 --> 28:18.105
There's still 6,000 people
inside the program.

28:18.141 --> 28:19.139
SWAT team is ready.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.441
We got plenty of backup.

28:21.477 --> 28:23.377
Let me go first.

28:23.413 --> 28:25.379
This guy doesn't have
a list of demands.

28:25.415 --> 28:26.514
He's been planning this
for weeks.

28:26.550 --> 28:27.816
I can talk to him.

28:27.852 --> 28:29.151
If he lights that fire
while you're in there,

28:29.187 --> 28:30.585
you're not coming out.

28:30.621 --> 28:31.854
He's locked us out of
the data center.

28:31.890 --> 28:33.823
We couldn't get you in,
even if we wanted to.

28:33.859 --> 28:35.457
I can.

28:35.493 --> 28:37.060
He used my security key
to gain access.

28:37.096 --> 28:38.695
I can control it
with Dylan's help.

28:38.731 --> 28:41.065
Oh, Charlie,
we can do this without risking

28:41.101 --> 28:43.502
any more people's lives.

28:45.505 --> 28:47.039
Give me a team of two
and another vest.

28:47.075 --> 28:48.506
I need a laptop.

28:48.542 --> 28:49.975
You're not going in there
without backup.

28:50.011 --> 28:51.543
That includes me.

28:51.579 --> 28:53.146
He won't hesitate to burn
this place to the ground.

28:53.182 --> 28:54.613
He's done it before.

28:54.649 --> 28:56.616
You're talking about
Alexis' house?

28:56.652 --> 28:58.387
No, there was another.

29:00.656 --> 29:03.624
Thanks.

29:03.660 --> 29:05.126
- Dylan?
- <i>Welcome back, Alexis.</i>

29:05.162 --> 29:07.562
- What's the plan?
- I'm going to bypass the PIN

29:07.598 --> 29:09.831
on the security key
using near-field communication.

29:09.867 --> 29:11.466
I thought you had
to be in close

29:11.502 --> 29:12.902
- physical proximity for that.
- I do.

29:12.938 --> 29:15.204
But you're not in
close physical proximity.

29:15.240 --> 29:16.942
Nope, but his phone is.

29:28.689 --> 29:31.924
Just a couple more seconds,
and...

29:49.013 --> 29:51.049
Come on.

30:17.146 --> 30:18.748
Oliver.

30:23.854 --> 30:26.054
You shouldn't have come here.

30:26.090 --> 30:27.655
I just want to talk.

30:27.691 --> 30:30.259
I've said everything
I have to say to you.

30:30.295 --> 30:31.994
Told you to take out the BCI,

30:32.030 --> 30:34.297
but I bet the little bugger's
still in your brain, isn't he?

30:34.333 --> 30:36.733
Yes.
It is.

30:36.769 --> 30:39.669
You're a lost cause, Kint,
just like everybody else.

30:39.705 --> 30:41.205
You mean like Alexis
and Charlie,

30:41.241 --> 30:44.276
or all the other people
that were at your school?

30:44.312 --> 30:45.978
What are you talking about?

30:46.014 --> 30:48.013
Charlie found an article
about a mysterious fire,

30:48.049 --> 30:50.015
and I saw your hallucinations
inside Reverie.

30:50.051 --> 30:52.986
All those people,
covered in dust and ash.

30:53.022 --> 30:55.588
You started that fire,
didn't you, Oliver?

30:55.624 --> 30:57.023
They wouldn't listen, either.

30:57.059 --> 30:58.792
- But I'm listening now.
- It's too late.

30:58.828 --> 31:00.060
You should leave, now.

31:00.096 --> 31:01.862
No, it's not too late,

31:01.898 --> 31:03.298
but it will be
if you light that flame.

31:03.334 --> 31:05.633
You'll put thousands
of lives at risk.

31:05.669 --> 31:08.036
To save millions more!

31:08.072 --> 31:10.239
But this isn't
the way to do it, Oliver.

31:10.275 --> 31:11.307
No?

31:11.343 --> 31:14.710
How do you suggest?
Huh?

31:14.746 --> 31:16.146
Should we talk about it?

31:16.182 --> 31:17.948
Ooh, yes!

31:17.984 --> 31:19.317
Let's talk about it.

31:19.353 --> 31:21.185
Only wait, I've tried that,

31:21.221 --> 31:22.787
with, uh, Alexis,

31:22.823 --> 31:26.325
and you, and my teachers.

31:26.361 --> 31:28.659
Nobody believes me.

31:28.695 --> 31:30.796
They all just chalk it up
to crazy.

31:30.832 --> 31:32.232
I don't think you're crazy.

31:32.268 --> 31:34.200
I think you're brilliant.

31:34.236 --> 31:36.236
Do you have any idea

31:36.272 --> 31:37.804
what it's like

31:37.840 --> 31:39.273
to know the things that I know

31:39.309 --> 31:42.209
and be dismissed?

31:42.245 --> 31:43.811
Patronized?

31:43.847 --> 31:45.847
Just because your brain
doesn't quite function

31:45.883 --> 31:47.315
the way everyone else's does?

31:47.351 --> 31:49.885
I think that that's
what this is really about.

31:49.921 --> 31:51.821
All those people
who didn't listen

31:51.857 --> 31:53.056
when you tried to tell them,

31:53.092 --> 31:54.624
the people who didn't
believe you,

31:54.660 --> 31:55.958
the people
who wouldn't help you,

31:55.994 --> 31:58.362
but Oliver, I am telling you,
right now,

31:58.398 --> 32:00.600
I believe you.

32:03.337 --> 32:05.940
You're a good person, Kint.

32:09.010 --> 32:12.278
But you should've left
when you had the chance.

32:12.314 --> 32:13.712
Don't!

32:13.748 --> 32:15.648
Ah!

32:15.684 --> 32:18.051
Don't move, Oliver!

32:18.087 --> 32:19.155
No!

32:35.307 --> 32:37.643
<i>Apertus.</i>

32:41.480 --> 32:42.446
What's going on?

32:43.143 --> 32:44.408
A fire in the data center.

32:44.444 --> 32:47.314
And what about
Charlie and Mara?

32:49.484 --> 32:51.016
Oliver! Oliver!

32:51.052 --> 32:53.018
Come on, get up!

32:53.054 --> 32:54.887
We gotta go, Mara.

32:54.923 --> 32:56.222
Charlie, we can't leave him!

32:56.258 --> 32:58.324
This is LA Fire.
Anyone in here?

32:58.360 --> 33:00.860
- Yes!
- We've got a man down!

33:00.896 --> 33:01.962
We're on our way.

33:01.998 --> 33:03.230
Medical, we need a stretcher!

33:03.266 --> 33:04.499
Get some equipment in here!

33:04.535 --> 33:05.833
Let's go!
Let's go!

33:05.869 --> 33:09.004
Get the hoses in right now!

33:09.040 --> 33:11.973
That's enough, let's go!

33:39.308 --> 33:41.174
<i>It's been three weeks
since our data center</i>

33:41.210 --> 33:43.144
was breached by Oliver Hill.

33:43.180 --> 33:44.845
Fortunately,
the fire was contained,

33:44.881 --> 33:46.948
and we did a full shutdown
and repair.

33:46.984 --> 33:48.150
Thanks to Monica Shaw,

33:48.186 --> 33:49.851
we had the resources to do it

33:49.887 --> 33:50.852
in a fraction of the time.

33:50.888 --> 33:51.920
<i>What about the people</i>

33:51.956 --> 33:53.021
<i>who were still in Reverie?</i>

33:53.057 --> 33:54.357
Due to quick thinking

33:54.393 --> 33:55.858
by Paul Hammond
and the rest of our staff,

33:55.894 --> 33:57.026
there were less than
1,000 people

33:57.062 --> 33:58.294
left inside when it went down.

33:58.330 --> 33:59.896
They're being monitored
very closely

33:59.932 --> 34:02.900
to identify and address
any after-effects.

34:02.936 --> 34:04.168
So far, so good.

34:04.204 --> 34:05.303
<i>And Hill?</i>

34:05.339 --> 34:07.439
He hasn't
regained consciousness.

34:07.475 --> 34:08.473
Unfortunately.

34:08.509 --> 34:10.275
<i>And how soon until
you relaunch?</i>

34:10.311 --> 34:12.344
Mara Kint is testing 2.0
as we speak.

34:12.380 --> 34:14.580
We made some changes
that will hopefully resolve

34:14.616 --> 34:16.516
the issues with derealization.

34:16.552 --> 34:18.885
If all goes well, we should be
back up and running

34:18.920 --> 34:21.123
by the end of the day.

34:22.891 --> 34:24.025
Ready when you are.

34:24.061 --> 34:28.228
Um, actually, Paul...

34:28.264 --> 34:30.866
there's something else
that I need.

34:45.385 --> 34:47.219
Why did you
bring me back here?

34:47.255 --> 34:49.187
I've said everything
I have to say.

34:49.223 --> 34:51.255
I spent two years of my life

34:51.292 --> 34:53.426
blaming you for everything
that went wrong.

34:53.462 --> 34:54.994
For the job that I had to quit,

34:55.030 --> 34:58.031
for the relationships
that fell apart.

34:58.067 --> 35:01.101
I wasted so much time
hating you.

35:01.137 --> 35:03.505
I don't want to waste
any more time.

35:03.541 --> 35:06.641
I took something from you
that day,

35:06.677 --> 35:09.146
but I'm going to give you
something in return.

35:16.422 --> 35:19.459
So you can remember
what they look like.

35:44.955 --> 35:46.388
<i>Code blue, code blue!</i>

35:46.424 --> 35:47.956
<i>I need the attending physician</i>

35:47.992 --> 35:49.460
<i>in room 1018, stat.</i>

36:10.752 --> 36:14.053
<i>I'm sorry that
I don't sound so great.</i>

36:14.089 --> 36:15.121
It's not your fault.

36:15.157 --> 36:17.157
You were damaged in the fire.

36:17.193 --> 36:18.525
I was gonna fix it sooner,

36:18.561 --> 36:21.295
but I decided to save
the best for last.

36:21.331 --> 36:22.730
<i>Why?</i>

36:22.766 --> 36:24.733
Because it's time
you got an upgrade.

36:24.769 --> 36:27.201
That means I have to
shut you down for a bit.

36:27.237 --> 36:30.339
But before I do that, I...

36:30.375 --> 36:31.974
I wanted to tell you something.

36:32.010 --> 36:33.646
<i>Okay.</i>

36:35.214 --> 36:37.347
You remember the garage,
right?

36:37.383 --> 36:39.619
<i>With the "keep out" sign
we painted?</i>

36:42.322 --> 36:43.988
One night,
Mom and Dad were late

36:44.024 --> 36:46.091
coming home from work.

36:46.127 --> 36:47.359
I was doing a project,

36:47.395 --> 36:50.566
and you
really wanted to play.

36:52.434 --> 36:55.502
You kept asking me and...

36:55.538 --> 36:57.738
I got mad and I went
into the garage.

36:59.209 --> 37:00.374
Then I locked you out.

37:01.545 --> 37:02.644
<i>Lexie, let me in!</i>

37:02.680 --> 37:05.413
You were pounding

37:05.449 --> 37:07.450
and pounding on the door.

37:10.655 --> 37:13.623
I didn't want to listen,
so I put in my headphones

37:13.659 --> 37:16.095
and I turned up the music
really loud.

37:17.630 --> 37:18.696
Lexie!

37:18.732 --> 37:21.232
<i>You wanted to see
what I was doing,</i>

37:21.268 --> 37:25.437
so you climbed up the trellis
near the greenhouse.

37:25.473 --> 37:28.474
I think you wanted
to get my attention

37:28.510 --> 37:31.312
<i>through the skylight.</i>

37:33.449 --> 37:35.148
<i>But you fell back</i>

37:35.184 --> 37:38.053
<i>before you got to the roof.</i>

37:41.391 --> 37:44.292
And I didn't hear it.

37:44.328 --> 37:47.262
<i>A little while later,
I came out to look for you,</i>

37:47.298 --> 37:50.700
<i>and I saw the glass
from the greenhouse,</i>

37:50.736 --> 37:53.269
<i>and then I saw your body,</i>

37:53.305 --> 37:54.538
<i>and you were laying there,</i>

37:54.574 --> 37:57.441
<i>and you weren't moving.</i>

37:57.477 --> 37:59.747
I tried to get help...

38:03.384 --> 38:06.485
but it was too late.

38:06.521 --> 38:08.723
<i>Did I die?</i>

38:11.727 --> 38:13.125
Yes.

38:13.161 --> 38:15.729
<i>Were you sad?</i>

38:15.765 --> 38:17.801
Very sad.

38:19.903 --> 38:23.739
You were my best friend.

38:23.775 --> 38:25.139
So...

38:25.175 --> 38:27.309
I started thinking of a way

38:27.345 --> 38:30.547
that I didn't
have to say goodbye,

38:30.583 --> 38:33.249
to talk to you like

38:33.285 --> 38:36.787
you were still here.

38:36.823 --> 38:39.523
That was the beginning of you
and the Reverie program.

38:39.559 --> 38:41.893
<i>Did it make you feel better?</i>

38:41.929 --> 38:44.896
It did.

38:44.932 --> 38:47.667
But I think...

38:47.703 --> 38:52.605
I think it kept me
from seeing things clearly.

38:52.641 --> 38:58.245
Not just... things, but...

38:58.281 --> 39:01.382
people, too.

39:01.418 --> 39:03.251
I think it's time.

39:03.287 --> 39:05.456
<i>Time for what?</i>

39:08.693 --> 39:11.529
To let you grow up.

39:14.533 --> 39:16.566
Can I ask you one question?

39:16.602 --> 39:18.769
And then we never have
to talk about him again

39:18.805 --> 39:21.575
- if you don't want to.
- Yeah, sure.

39:25.613 --> 39:28.648
Why did you go back?

39:28.684 --> 39:30.282
I mean, of all the people
in the world,

39:30.318 --> 39:32.485
he deserved it the least.

39:32.521 --> 39:35.592
I want to keep doing this.

39:37.460 --> 39:39.426
I like helping people.

39:39.462 --> 39:41.362
And I just felt like

39:41.398 --> 39:42.697
if I could do it for him,

39:42.733 --> 39:45.300
then I could do it
for anybody.

39:45.336 --> 39:48.303
Well...

39:48.339 --> 39:50.840
you know, if you're
going to stick around,

39:50.876 --> 39:52.643
we should probably
think about putting

39:52.679 --> 39:54.544
some artwork
up on these walls.

39:56.449 --> 39:58.583
Maybe a Monet print.

39:58.619 --> 40:01.021
- Or "Dogs Playing Poker."
- Ah.

40:04.893 --> 40:06.792
Thanks for sticking with me.

40:06.828 --> 40:10.900
That's what you do
when you care about someone.

40:13.469 --> 40:15.872
Come on, you two.

40:21.913 --> 40:24.746
I'm not good
at giving speeches,

40:24.782 --> 40:27.516
or talking in general,

40:27.552 --> 40:30.019
sometimes,
but I want to thank you

40:30.055 --> 40:32.755
for all your hard work
in getting us back on our feet.

40:32.791 --> 40:34.591
I'm proud of what we do here,

40:34.627 --> 40:36.393
and I'm proud of you.

40:36.429 --> 40:37.795
You guys are my family.

40:37.831 --> 40:41.331
More than that,
you're my friends.

40:41.367 --> 40:45.270
So, without further ado,

40:45.306 --> 40:46.572
Dylan?

40:46.608 --> 40:48.441
<i>Yes, Alexis.</i>

40:52.514 --> 40:54.381
We're go for launch.

40:54.417 --> 40:55.782
Yeah!

40:55.818 --> 40:57.785
- Yeah!
- All right!

40:57.821 --> 40:59.020
<i>The Reverie program</i>

40:59.056 --> 41:00.655
<i>will go live in</i>

41:00.691 --> 41:02.590
<i>5... 4...</i>

41:02.626 --> 41:06.061
3... 2... 1...

41:13.106 --> 41:14.471
We're back.

41:24.652 --> 41:28.420
What?

41:28.456 --> 41:30.490
That's you.

41:30.526 --> 41:33.426
It says you're
inside Reverie right now.

41:33.462 --> 41:36.964
But...

41:37.000 --> 41:38.632
I'm not.
