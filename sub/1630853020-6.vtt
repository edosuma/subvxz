00:14.040 --> 00:17.320
<i>Aethelhelm plotted to unseat King Edward</i>

00:17.400 --> 00:20.200
<i>and put his grandson Aelfweard</i>
<i>on the throne.</i>

00:20.280 --> 00:24.920
You are a fine and true young man
who will one day be a mighty king.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.480
<i>He planned to have the visionary Aalys</i>
<i>killed on her pilgrimage to Lindisfarne.</i>

00:29.560 --> 00:32.360
<i>- And blamed the murder on the Danes.</i>

00:32.440 --> 00:35.360
You do realize this could start a war
between Christian and Dane.

00:35.440 --> 00:36.840
Hopefully, yes.

00:36.920 --> 00:42.080
<i>But unknown to him, his daughter,</i>
<i>Queen Aelflaed, journeyed with Aalys.</i>

00:42.160 --> 00:43.640
I am the visionary!

00:44.240 --> 00:45.160
Who did this?

00:45.240 --> 00:49.640
They were sent from the king of Jorvik.
They said Sigtryggr wanted vengeance.

00:50.280 --> 00:53.440
<i>Despite Brida taking Father Pyrlig</i>
<i>as her prisoner,</i>

00:53.520 --> 00:55.280
<i>a bond has formed between them.</i>

00:55.360 --> 00:58.080
I accept your offer of safe passage
and protection.

00:58.160 --> 00:59.400
Take me to Uhtred.

00:59.480 --> 01:03.720
<i>Aelswith has made a new plan</i>
<i>to protect her granddaughter, Aelfwynn.</i>

01:03.800 --> 01:08.520
I have chosen you a husband,
someone you know. I will explain.

01:08.600 --> 01:13.000
<i>Aethelhelm’s men marched</i>
<i>on the Danes of Rumcofa in revenge</i>

01:13.080 --> 01:15.680
<i>- for the attack on the pilgrims.</i>

01:16.880 --> 01:20.920
<i>Osferth was among those</i>
<i>who fell defending them.</i>

01:21.680 --> 01:25.000
<i>Aethelhelm has discovered</i>
<i>what his plotting has cost him.</i>

01:25.080 --> 01:27.400
Your daughter was traveling
with the pilgrims.

01:27.480 --> 01:28.880
And was also slaughtered.

01:28.960 --> 01:33.320
<i>And ow, both King Edward</i>
<i>and Sigtryggr prepare for war.</i>

01:33.400 --> 01:36.200
His wife... for mine.

01:36.280 --> 01:39.160
Sigtryggr! Sigtryggr!
Sigtryggr...

01:39.240 --> 01:41.800
<i> Destiny, is all!</i>

01:56.040 --> 01:58.600
Edward knows nothing
of what he’s unleashed.

01:58.680 --> 02:00.800
Truly he has stirred the hornet's nest.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.640
Two days!

02:04.640 --> 02:10.400
In two days we mount the heads
of Saxon turds on spikes!

02:14.000 --> 02:15.080
Brother...

02:15.759 --> 02:20.000
I have spoken with the men and all agree.
We should surprise them on the road.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.640
No. The king has chosen the battle site.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.280
Sigtryggr, they outnumber us.

02:24.360 --> 02:27.560
If Edward thinks numbers will win this,
his arrogance will be his undoing.

02:27.640 --> 02:30.200
- He believes we’re at his mercy.
- It is not wise, brother.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.120
But it is necessary,
Rognvaldr.

02:32.200 --> 02:35.040
Our people will paint the land
with Saxon blood.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.000
If you’re afraid, you may stand down.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.400
All who fight as brothers, fight as one.

02:40.480 --> 02:43.360
We attack from the high hill!

02:59.200 --> 03:03.080
<i>Sigtryggr hopes that by attacking</i>
<i>from high terrain, he can overwhelm us.</i>

03:03.160 --> 03:05.280
But we will turn his attack
to our advantage.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.240
We launch our assault here with 300 men.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.040
Danes attack, yes, but it will give us
the time to move here

03:12.120 --> 03:13.240
and take out their vanguard.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.880
Those men will most likely be lost.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.240
Then they shall be lost with honor.

03:21.560 --> 03:25.120
It is the price we must pay to protect
our kingdoms from the heathens.

03:26.440 --> 03:29.480
Ensure Lord Aethelhelm is located
and told of our intentions.

03:33.320 --> 03:36.760
King Edward is camped 20 miles
from here and the Danes are marching.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.960
The men grow tired of waiting,
but they remain loyal.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.320
Good. Then we wait.

03:44.120 --> 03:47.280
In Edward's hour of need,
we ride to the Saxons' aid.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.840
We must watch the young Aethelstan.
Keep him close.

03:50.920 --> 03:54.200
There are those
that have ambitions for the boy.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.680
You are now Aelfweard's one true ally.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.360
Yes.

04:01.800 --> 04:07.800
Let us therefore pray my daughter’s
sacrifice may yet bear fruit.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.000
Keep an eye on Aethelstan.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.600
Lord, we must rest the horses.

04:30.680 --> 04:33.520
Eat faster. We have men to kill.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.160
Edward will have camped north.

04:38.160 --> 04:41.400
- What if he’s already moved on?
- Then we catch up to him.

04:41.880 --> 04:45.680
We find the king
and then we seize Aethelhelm.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.800
Each man take a limb
and we tear him into quarters.

04:51.440 --> 04:53.120
There are only three of us, Lord.

04:57.720 --> 04:59.760
Osferth's spirit will stand in place.

04:59.840 --> 05:02.800
His spirit is busy taunting
the fool that got him killed.

05:02.880 --> 05:05.000
You’re not guilty of this, Finan.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.600
- Save your anger for the ones that are.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.560
Aethelhelm will get what is coming to him.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.960
But first we must avert this war.

06:08.800 --> 06:13.360


06:18.800 --> 06:21.440
We cannot linger here.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.400
Where is Cynlaef?

06:23.480 --> 06:26.040
Perhaps he resists the offer of my hand.

06:26.120 --> 06:30.720
Unlikely. You allowed him to touch you.
He will want more.

06:31.400 --> 06:34.040
That is just the way of young men.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.640
Besides, he has been given an order.

06:38.640 --> 06:40.680
Do not pull that face.

06:40.760 --> 06:43.920
We all want this whole ghastly affair
to be over.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.120
I'm sure Cynlaef will not let you down.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.280
My lady,
one of your guard approaches.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.640
I know this man. He is loyal.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.080
Redwald, what news do you bring?

07:03.160 --> 07:06.320
There has been
a massacre in Rumcofa, my lady.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.160
Countless Danes put to the sword.

07:08.240 --> 07:11.000
Men and women both,
children and the elderly.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.920
- Who carried out this attack?
- We cannot be certain.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.160
But there have been rumors.
Some say war is coming.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.560
These lands are no longer safe.

07:19.640 --> 07:23.400
- Cynlaef may yet still live.
- We cannot linger here longer.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.680
I must get you to safety.

07:35.440 --> 07:38.040
- Shh, there are men in the trees.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.000
Warriors.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.560
They are merely scouts,
resting on their journey.

07:52.840 --> 07:56.440
- I thought it was an ambush.
- They won't harm us.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.600
Did you think I intended to murder you?

08:00.680 --> 08:02.480
The thought did cross my mind.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.800
- You’re no use to me dead.
- So why did you stay just now?

08:07.200 --> 08:09.240
I need you to speak for me
when I stand before Uhtred.

08:09.320 --> 08:12.040
Or perhaps you despise me
less than I thought.

08:14.120 --> 08:17.560
Your company’s torturous.
I've had boils I liked better.

08:18.480 --> 08:19.440
I see.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.440
I'll go and speak with them.
Perhaps they have news.

08:27.160 --> 08:30.080
I will not let you lock me away
in a convent!

08:30.160 --> 08:31.280
It is safe there.

08:31.360 --> 08:32.960
This morning I was to be wedded

08:33.040 --> 08:36.880
and now I am being banished to a place
of chastity and prayers at dawn!

08:36.960 --> 08:39.799
Things have changed.
It is our only option.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.720
You would not treat my mother
with such torment.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.799
You are not her.

08:46.799 --> 08:49.120
You simply wish to be rid of me.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.120
How can you say such things?

08:52.200 --> 08:56.800
- I have done my very best to protect you--
- And you have utterly failed me.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.120
As you did my mother.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.720
Gather your things.
We depart before the day is ended.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.160
If we have to travel by darkness,
so be it!

09:09.360 --> 09:12.240
- Ensure she does not leave this room.
- Yes, my lady.

09:13.240 --> 09:14.720
I shall not go!

09:15.760 --> 09:18.600
And you cannot keep me here
against my will!

09:21.320 --> 09:23.320
It saddens me to hear of this massacre.

09:24.600 --> 09:29.400
- Rumcofa was a haven for many.
- No longer. We ride now for Aegelesburg.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.880
We wish to be as far as possible
from this bloodshed.

09:31.960 --> 09:35.120
- And Edward is coming north?
- He’s already on the road.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.720
The kingdoms are in turmoil.

09:36.800 --> 09:40.400
The peace that existed between
Saxon and Dane has ended.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.440
They’re at war.

09:42.560 --> 09:47.200
It is time for us to take our leave,
unless you need any assistance.

09:50.000 --> 09:50.960
No.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.840
My companion and I have all we need.

09:58.680 --> 10:00.200
What news did he offer?

10:00.280 --> 10:03.880
Nothing of importance,
but we should set out at once.

10:03.960 --> 10:05.240
What’s the hurry?

10:05.720 --> 10:10.200
Honestly...
I cannot wait to escape this blasted cold.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.240
Besides, the sooner
we meet with Uhtred the better.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.120
More sent from the northern burhs.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.400
We look strong.

10:53.080 --> 10:56.000
Lord King, we bring grave news.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.240
Sigtryggr did not kill the queen.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.640
It was the work of Aethelhelm's men.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.480
- Send for Sigtryggr!
- Yes, Lord.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.400
Our scouts say
it's not Edward’s camp.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.480
The banners belong to one of his lords.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.560
Perhaps the gods are speaking to us.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.320
Perhaps we can use this.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.320
Edward's chances dwindle
with fewer allies on the field.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.320
The king’s forces
can afford to lose men.

11:48.400 --> 11:49.280
Can we?

11:52.800 --> 11:55.840
They have scouts.
They’ll see you coming around the lake.

11:57.680 --> 12:01.280
We need not go around the lake.
It’s frozen.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.880
We could go over it.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.880
<i>No Saxon would ever condemn</i>
<i>his daughter to such an end.</i>

12:09.960 --> 12:11.840
He did not order her death.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.120
It was the visionary Aalys
he sought to kill.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.400
When the moment came, the queen
sacrificed herself to save the girl.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.600
- Do you have proof of this?
- I have spoken to Aalys.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.400
- I've seen the horror in her eyes.
- And Sigtryggr had no part in this?

12:25.480 --> 12:27.800
He could not have planned it.
No one knew the Queen traveled.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.440
The country is full of spies.

12:29.520 --> 12:32.960
What reason would Sigtryggr have to attack
a farm girl and then deny it?

12:35.800 --> 12:40.440
Lord, Aethelhelm must be hunted down
and brought to justice.

12:40.520 --> 12:42.480
Aelflaed's blood is on his hands.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.600
As is Osferth's...

12:47.960 --> 12:49.600
your father's natural son.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.160
He was one of my most loyal men.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.040
He fought at my side for Wessex
through countless battles.

13:01.360 --> 13:02.960
I’m sorry to hear it.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.640
Only Aethelhelm benefits from this chaos.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.480
He wants you to turn
to him and his armies,

13:08.560 --> 13:11.120
so he may strut again
in the palace in Winchester.

13:18.680 --> 13:20.440
He must be apprehended.

13:21.840 --> 13:25.000
A rider was dispatched to find him
and will soon return.

13:25.080 --> 13:26.560
Send word to Aegelesburg.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.360
Aelfweard is to be shielded
from his grandfather's influence

13:29.440 --> 13:31.200
and protected by my personal guard.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.720
That order should extend to Aethelstan.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.960
He stands between
Aelfweard and the throne.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.200
I sent Aethelstan to find Aethelhelm.

13:40.760 --> 13:41.840
Then he is in danger.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.600
What of the war with Sigtryggr?

13:46.960 --> 13:48.840
Tell Sigtryggr our conflict is over.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.920
My quarrel now is with Aethelhelm.

13:55.080 --> 13:59.200
Your strategy at Lindcylne was a good one.
Why abandon it for uncertainty?

13:59.280 --> 14:01.240
Because I hear your words.

14:01.320 --> 14:03.080
We do not have men to spare.

14:03.880 --> 14:08.000
This stealth attack could destroy hundreds
of Saxons with little loss of Dane life.

14:08.720 --> 14:09.560
It is a gift.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.280
Or a trap! What if the ice doesn’t hold?

14:12.360 --> 14:13.240
It will.

14:17.680 --> 14:19.200
I can see from here it will.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.320
I have crossed frozen fjords in Iceland,

14:26.400 --> 14:29.560
- slept before the ice rivers of Irland--
- This is Mercia.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.360
The weather of these lands
is as unpredictable

14:32.440 --> 14:33.880
as the Saxons who live on them.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.920
That does not change the nature of ice,
my queen.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.440
But it is, as she says, a risk.

14:41.520 --> 14:42.600
All is a risk.

14:46.120 --> 14:47.880
Let me show you I am right.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.280
I will walk upon the ice
to measure its strength.

14:53.720 --> 14:55.200
You tested me once.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.560
I survived.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.280
Let me show you I can lead in battle.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.480
Gods offer you this, Sigtryggr.

15:12.080 --> 15:13.800
Do not slight them by refusing it.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.840
It is a risk.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.840
But we will at least test it.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.360
Once night falls, have him test the ice.

15:34.800 --> 15:38.320
- I will take word to the Danes.
- We will find you there.

15:38.400 --> 15:42.120
Aethelhelm shall be found and tried
before Saxons and Danes.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.440
We can forge a new union with Daneland.

15:44.520 --> 15:45.800
For that, I am glad.

15:49.200 --> 15:52.840
I am sorry for Osferth,
even though I did not know him well.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.800
He was still your blood.

15:58.080 --> 16:02.000
- You were his true brother.
- Yes. And I will avenge him.

16:14.320 --> 16:15.440
Lord Aethelhelm.

16:17.320 --> 16:21.760
As requested, I’ve stationed men to patrol
the east and the west perimeters.

16:22.920 --> 16:27.000
With the lake at our backs and ample eyes
to the trees, our camp may rest soundly.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.760
Look, I wish to inspire my men,
maintain their spirits, but…

16:36.240 --> 16:37.600
I fear I’m falling short.

16:41.640 --> 16:46.120
On the contrary,
you are an inspiration to them.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.440
You are proving yourself a true leader.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.120
Any minute now he'll pull a miracle
out of his saintly arse.

16:58.200 --> 17:02.080
He is both righteous and pompous,
just like his father.

17:02.160 --> 17:05.760
I have news. The ladies Aelswith
and Aelfwynn have been spotted.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.960
They travel with a personal guard.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.440
- Where are they?
- South of Buccstan.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.400
They were seen by Mercian monks.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.920
Silver is a god all men serve.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.680
Well,
the ladies will have to be rescued.

17:20.760 --> 17:24.160
The princess is important to us.
Her safety is our greatest concern.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.000
We need to get rid of him.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.400
Accidents can happen.

17:31.079 --> 17:32.240
Even at night.

17:34.080 --> 17:37.280
We are leaving for the nunnery
before the sun sets.

17:37.360 --> 17:40.360
The sooner we move on
from this place the better.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.960
- Lady Aelswith.
- Eadith?

17:47.040 --> 17:50.840
I’ve come to warn you
and Lady Aelfwynn. You are in danger.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.040
A man is tracking you.

17:52.120 --> 17:55.640
A man who seeks to exchange news
of your whereabouts for coin.

17:55.720 --> 17:56.880
You are certain of this?

17:56.960 --> 17:59.320
I would not have journeyed
all this way if I was not.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.720
Come with me.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.840
We are leaving before the day is over.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.920
You cannot wait even that long.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.520
Go now. Whoever this man is,
you do not want to meet him.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.800
Then we must go where he will not find us.

18:11.880 --> 18:15.280
In truth,
it should comfort Aelfwynn to see you.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.760
Where is Lady Aelfwynn?

18:24.840 --> 18:27.400
- How could you let her leave?
- I did not know.

18:29.520 --> 18:30.720
She has fled.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.440
She has taken her horse.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.680
This assault makes me uneasy.

18:55.760 --> 18:59.560
Is it the assault that troubles you,
my love, or the one I chose to lead it?

19:00.160 --> 19:01.720
You’re entrusting him with too much.

19:01.800 --> 19:05.720
He seeks atonement by facing danger,

19:05.800 --> 19:08.000
a danger that will be great, which is why…

19:09.400 --> 19:13.600
I need you to go straight to the safety of
the surrounding trees as soon as we cross.

19:16.880 --> 19:20.400
Your plan is a good one.
You placed your trust in it.

19:21.880 --> 19:23.120
Brother.

19:24.360 --> 19:27.680
- It is as we hoped.
- We may have found a way across the ice.

19:28.920 --> 19:32.520
Then the gods have answered us.
Tell the men.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.720
We rise before dawn and we attack them
in their deepest sleep.

19:37.880 --> 19:40.080
When we cross over,
make for the high ground.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.480
Strike down those Saxons
as they try to flee.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.920
- Lord Uhtred!
- It is one of Edward’s scouts.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.480
What news do you bring?

20:05.560 --> 20:08.560
Lord Aethelhelm
is camped in a valley north of here,

20:08.640 --> 20:10.640
on the banks of a frozen lake.

20:10.720 --> 20:14.000
- He has raised a vast army.
- Edward is on the road behind us.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.720
Find him and tell him
where Aethelhelm is camped.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.080
We must get to the lake.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.160
That way.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.680
Let’s go.

25:16.200 --> 25:19.560
- Help! Help!

26:15.400 --> 26:17.200
This cannot be.

26:17.280 --> 26:18.440
Forget them!

26:19.120 --> 26:22.120
Protect me at all costs!

26:22.800 --> 26:25.320
Shield Wall!

27:06.920 --> 27:08.160
Watch out, brother!

27:13.760 --> 27:15.880
Dear god, we’re too late.

27:15.960 --> 27:17.960
We must find a way to stop this,
Lord.

27:18.040 --> 27:19.880
- Stiorra!

27:20.880 --> 27:24.040
- You must help Sigtryggr.
- No, I must stop him.

27:24.120 --> 27:27.280
Aethelhelm was the one responsible
for the massacre at Rumcofa.

27:28.040 --> 27:31.760
This is his camp. Edward is coming
with 1,000 men to apprehend him.

27:32.600 --> 27:35.560
He sought to restore the peace,
but when he sees this…

27:35.640 --> 27:37.240
We must tell Sigtryggr.

27:37.320 --> 27:38.640
He has seen reason before.

27:38.720 --> 27:39.720
Stay here.

27:41.120 --> 27:44.280
Get Aethelstan to safety
and cut a path to Sigtryggr.

27:44.360 --> 27:45.840
It’s the only way to stop this.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.360
And Aethelhelm is to be taken alive!

28:10.560 --> 28:11.840
Aethelstan!

28:17.040 --> 28:18.000
Aethelstan!

28:32.920 --> 28:35.560
Aethelhelm! Why do you not fight?

28:48.280 --> 28:49.520
Aethelstan!

29:23.640 --> 29:25.120
Aethelstan!

29:40.640 --> 29:42.520
Sihtric, get him to safety!

29:43.320 --> 29:45.720
You find Sigtryggr,
I’ll deal with Aethelhelm!

30:08.840 --> 30:10.480
I rode for peace.

30:10.560 --> 30:13.560
And Sigtryggr has repaid us
with more bloodshed!

30:13.640 --> 30:15.240
Lord, what would you have us do?

30:16.440 --> 30:20.680
We must trust, Uhtred.
There is still time for him to stop this.

30:28.400 --> 30:29.560
Sigtryggr!

30:31.400 --> 30:32.480
Aethelstan.

30:33.400 --> 30:34.480
Where is my father?

30:34.560 --> 30:37.400
He’s still searching for Sigtryggr.

30:41.280 --> 30:44.360
- Stop fighting me!

30:46.720 --> 30:50.640
- I don’t want to kill you!

30:50.720 --> 30:53.040
Stop! Sigtryggr!

30:54.600 --> 30:57.320
Many more lives will be lost
if we do not act now.

30:57.400 --> 31:01.720
Those men, your men, they are
Christian souls, the future of England.

31:02.640 --> 31:04.920
That is what Aethelhelm wishes to destroy.

31:07.880 --> 31:08.800
Yes.

31:10.120 --> 31:12.160
Aethelhelm cannot be allowed to succeed.

31:13.520 --> 31:14.880
They must be saved.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.560
Edward is coming!

31:51.320 --> 31:53.400
Men! With me!

31:54.040 --> 31:55.080
Hold them!

31:59.040 --> 32:02.240
Men! With me!

32:18.480 --> 32:20.880
Aethelhelm, I'm coming for you!

32:20.960 --> 32:22.320
You’re a dead man!

32:22.400 --> 32:24.120
Fight me!

32:24.200 --> 32:26.400
I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you!

32:26.480 --> 32:27.880
Get me away from here!

32:27.960 --> 32:29.800
- Fight me!
- Pull back!

32:29.880 --> 32:31.360
Too many protect him!

32:53.360 --> 32:54.560
Now surrender!

33:19.320 --> 33:20.800
Sigtryggr!

33:29.360 --> 33:30.280
Get back!

33:31.720 --> 33:33.920
Retreat! Get back!

33:35.640 --> 33:39.120
Retreat! Fall back!

33:48.560 --> 33:50.080
Hold on!

33:50.160 --> 33:51.200
Sigtryggr!

34:18.199 --> 34:20.239
Rognvaldr! Rognvaldr!

34:26.760 --> 34:28.840
- Sigtryggr!

34:28.920 --> 34:30.480
- Sigtryggr!

34:30.560 --> 34:33.000
Stop! No more slaughter!

34:34.480 --> 34:36.760
No more slaughter!
Put down your swords!

34:41.960 --> 34:44.360
- Sigtryggr must not be harmed!
- Look around!

34:44.440 --> 34:48.080
- Look at what his anger has wrought!
- Aethelhelm is to blame!

34:49.239 --> 34:50.400
Put down your swords!

34:50.480 --> 34:51.960
It is over!

35:00.000 --> 35:01.800
- No, Stiorra!
- Let me go!

35:01.880 --> 35:03.080
You cannot save them.

35:04.480 --> 35:05.560
It’s done.

35:05.640 --> 35:07.440
No.

35:14.520 --> 35:15.440
Stiorra!

35:18.440 --> 35:21.240
A king should always heed the good counsel
of his queen.

35:22.360 --> 35:25.800
- I should not have forgotten this.
- You have time to make it up to me still.

35:27.880 --> 35:32.440
Aethelhelm provoked this.
The massacre in Rumcofa was his doing.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.200
Edward was never your enemy.

35:36.120 --> 35:38.920
I was riding to tell you
he was calling for a truce.

35:39.480 --> 35:42.880
In the midst of battle,
Aethelhelm escaped.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.360
It is over for us, then.

35:48.560 --> 35:49.720
No. It is not.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.440
Lord King.

35:57.080 --> 35:58.640
I’ve come to speak for Stiorra.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.560
She has killed no Saxons in this fight.

36:03.280 --> 36:05.080
Lord, I appeal to you as her father.

36:07.040 --> 36:07.960
Spare her.

36:13.960 --> 36:14.960
Then she is spared.

36:16.000 --> 36:16.960
You have my word.

36:19.000 --> 36:19.880
Thank you, Lord.

36:21.680 --> 36:22.520
Thank you.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.040
What of Sigtryggr?

36:26.920 --> 36:28.320
His fate is to be decided.

36:32.880 --> 36:34.400
Swear a new alliance with him.

36:34.480 --> 36:38.400
You would have me pardon a man who
slaughtered so many innocent Christians?

36:38.480 --> 36:40.840
You have won some favor
with the Lords here today.

36:41.440 --> 36:44.160
- Do not risk it.
- Favor is not only won with the sword.

36:44.880 --> 36:46.680
Your men know that you can fight.

36:46.760 --> 36:48.600
Show them that you also know mercy.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.680
Our people must be assured
of your leadership.

36:50.760 --> 36:54.680
They are not the only ones, Lord.
The Danes are also your people now.

36:54.760 --> 36:58.000
You must unite them all,
ensure that this does not happen again.

37:03.880 --> 37:04.920
Do not despair.

37:05.960 --> 37:08.160
There is still much for our kin
to sing of.

37:29.600 --> 37:32.440
For many years there was peace
between Saxon and Dane...

37:33.240 --> 37:37.360
until one emerged who has sown hatred
between our God and yours.

37:38.200 --> 37:39.960
This battle shattered that peace.

37:43.040 --> 37:44.640
I have decided to restore it.

37:46.280 --> 37:49.720
I give you my word
as King of all the Saxons.

37:52.440 --> 37:53.480
In exchange...

37:54.840 --> 37:56.800
you must accept the gift of baptism.

37:58.280 --> 38:01.000
All shall be welcomed
into the family of Christ.

38:01.920 --> 38:04.480
Never again
will our people face such division.

38:07.240 --> 38:08.360
We will be united.

38:09.200 --> 38:12.000
You ask to strip them of their gods,
of who they are.

38:12.880 --> 38:13.920
It is too much.

38:14.600 --> 38:16.000
It is an offer of peace.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.760
A Dane stripped of his gods
is no longer a Dane.

38:24.840 --> 38:29.400
Your people will be safe,
but under the rule of a Christian king.

38:31.240 --> 38:32.600
We must do it.

38:38.480 --> 38:39.920
It is over, brother.

38:43.040 --> 38:44.440
Stiorra was right.

38:47.240 --> 38:48.600
You are a coward.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.160
I will not swear.

38:57.680 --> 38:58.520
I cannot.

39:07.120 --> 39:07.960
So be it.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.400
It does not have to come to this.

39:13.480 --> 39:17.040
He has chosen, Uhtred,
and I cannot go back on my word.

39:23.720 --> 39:27.280
- He is not the one to blame.
- Aethelhelm is responsible.

39:27.360 --> 39:28.840
And yet he has fled the battlefield.

39:28.920 --> 39:31.880
Aethelhelm worked
to destroy the peace you created.

39:32.640 --> 39:35.360
If Sigtryggr dies, he has won.

39:36.520 --> 39:37.640
Do not let him.

39:53.360 --> 39:54.480
What did the king say?

39:58.560 --> 39:59.680
You have been spared.

40:03.480 --> 40:06.040
But Edward is to be Overlord of Eoferwic.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.600
And Sigtryggr is sentenced to death.

40:24.320 --> 40:25.240
I am to die.

40:27.320 --> 40:28.320
I’m sorry.

40:31.240 --> 40:33.880
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

40:33.960 --> 40:34.880
Do not be.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.120
I have failed.

40:38.760 --> 40:40.560
I let them take everything.

40:40.640 --> 40:41.840
You have not failed.

40:43.560 --> 40:45.040
I will take back Eoferwic.

40:46.400 --> 40:49.200
Danes will live there in peace
for countless generations.

41:01.720 --> 41:03.200
You must be the one to do it.

41:08.960 --> 41:11.880
- Do not ask me to do this.
- Uhtred.

41:13.880 --> 41:16.600
I only wish for an honorable death...

41:18.160 --> 41:19.760
at the hands of a great warrior.

41:23.920 --> 41:26.280
I wish to the gods we were not here.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.280
Perhaps we would not be.

41:32.640 --> 41:34.200
You brought Edward here.

41:34.280 --> 41:36.400
If you had done nothing,
we would have won.

41:44.480 --> 41:46.520
They will cheer for you in Valhalla.

41:48.280 --> 41:50.280
And I will sing for you here on earth.

41:52.320 --> 41:55.560
I will wait for you
in the halls of our ancestors.

41:56.720 --> 41:57.680
Will you find me?

42:23.840 --> 42:25.760
They may butcher our bodies…

42:28.560 --> 42:30.720
our souls are Odin's own.

44:26.440 --> 44:28.240
- We should stop to rest soon.
- Wait.

44:29.480 --> 44:30.480
Stand back.

44:33.960 --> 44:35.880
Do not be afraid.
We mean you no harm.

44:35.960 --> 44:38.760
- You’re one of Sigtryggr’s men.

44:39.520 --> 44:40.600
Who did this?

44:40.680 --> 44:43.720
Saxons. They slaughtered us.

44:43.800 --> 44:46.960
We fought only
to avenge our people.

44:47.040 --> 44:49.880
Was Uhtred Ragnarson
at the battle? Uhtred Ragnarson?

44:49.960 --> 44:53.920
He fought with the Saxons.

45:09.440 --> 45:12.320
- Brida.
- You promised me a path to forgiveness.

45:14.480 --> 45:16.200
Is this the peace you speak of?

45:17.440 --> 45:19.360
- What you have with Uhtred--
- Is worse!

45:20.600 --> 45:23.360
The Danes lived with the Saxons
in harmony for years.

45:23.840 --> 45:25.240
Uhtred's daughter was their queen

45:25.320 --> 45:28.160
and yet they slaughtered them like dogs.
What will they do to me?

45:28.240 --> 45:31.520
The conflict between Edward and Sigtryggr
is entirely separate.

45:34.120 --> 45:35.040
Conflict?

45:37.320 --> 45:40.320
What conflict?
Did you know that this would happen?

45:40.400 --> 45:43.800
The scout mentioned
that Edward was riding north. That is all.

45:47.880 --> 45:49.640
- You lied to me.
- No.

45:49.720 --> 45:51.560
You used my grief for Vibeke to disarm me?

45:51.640 --> 45:54.200
- No, that is not true--
- You’re leading me into a trap!

45:55.320 --> 45:57.440
I only sought to help you find redemption.

45:58.040 --> 45:59.200
Redemption?

45:59.880 --> 46:00.880
Peace?

46:01.880 --> 46:04.520
Mere words used to mask your true motives.

46:05.760 --> 46:07.560
There can be no reconciliation.

46:09.200 --> 46:11.760
- You wish to help me, Father Pyrlig?

46:11.840 --> 46:13.840
Then give Uhtred a message if you live.

46:15.840 --> 46:17.240
Tell him I’m coming for him.

46:47.160 --> 46:49.040
We should not
have left Rumcofa.

46:51.080 --> 46:53.280
Perhaps then Osferth may still be with us.

46:57.800 --> 47:00.240
I wish to go back to my old life, Uhtred.

47:01.600 --> 47:02.760
That time is over.

47:04.400 --> 47:06.160
Men look to you now as a leader.

47:08.480 --> 47:09.560
I wish they did not.

47:18.040 --> 47:20.400
I wish
that this had not come to pass.

47:22.360 --> 47:25.600
Yet, there is hope,
even in all this despair.

47:27.200 --> 47:29.200
Eoferwic is yours, Lord King.

47:30.240 --> 47:32.680
The dream of England
has never been closer.

47:48.640 --> 47:51.200
- I will ensure you’re safe in Eoferwic.
- How?

47:52.000 --> 47:56.200
You have broken the spirits
of my kin. It is no longer a refuge.

47:58.320 --> 47:59.640
You still have family.

48:00.480 --> 48:01.680
I’m also your kin.

48:02.560 --> 48:03.760
We can build a new home.

48:04.800 --> 48:06.120
I knew love, Father.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.640
I left a queen and now I have nothing.

48:11.080 --> 48:13.120
Edward's victory has been my undoing.

48:35.480 --> 48:38.640
We can lie low here,
set out at first light.

48:38.720 --> 48:41.800
Find the nearest port town and bribe
our way in a ship bound for Frankia.

48:41.880 --> 48:45.480
I have no intention
of slinking off into the shadows.

48:46.400 --> 48:49.120
Lord, you have lost your army...

48:49.920 --> 48:51.920
your reputation with the king.

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
My grandson now stands alone.

48:55.080 --> 48:58.480
Securing his legacy
has never been more urgent.

49:01.280 --> 49:04.040
- What about you?
- Complete the task I was set.

49:04.120 --> 49:08.880
I was sent to secure an alliance
with the King of Scotia.

49:08.960 --> 49:11.120
I intend to turn it to my advantage.

49:11.200 --> 49:17.000
Only Constantin of Scotia,
the true Christian king,

49:17.080 --> 49:20.240
has power to end Edward's tyranny.

49:22.200 --> 49:25.960
King Constantin will be expecting a gift.

49:27.320 --> 49:28.880
We shall give him one.

49:30.920 --> 49:34.080
<i>The Lady Aelfwynn is without allies.</i>

49:35.480 --> 49:36.920
<i>You must retrieve her.</i>

49:57.440 --> 50:00.440
The Northumbrians share much news,
Lord King.

50:00.520 --> 50:03.360
The Saxon Edward has routed Sigtryggr.

50:03.440 --> 50:06.840
Then we were wise to invite
the Northumbrians as our guests.

50:07.960 --> 50:09.880
Will we be executing any of them?

50:11.400 --> 50:14.320
We’ll make one an example
and the other lords will swear.

50:17.480 --> 50:20.320
All stand for King Constantin of Scotland!

50:24.880 --> 50:27.880
Welcome, Lords of Northumbria...

50:28.760 --> 50:30.800
to this feast of friendship.

50:31.760 --> 50:37.320
Whilst our ale is strong and plentiful,
the day comes with sobering news.

50:37.400 --> 50:42.960
Edward turned on his greatest ealdormen
and he turned on his ally Sigtryggr.

50:43.720 --> 50:47.840
From this we assume
we must prepare for hostilities.

50:49.280 --> 50:52.480
We fear he will turn his gaze northward

50:52.560 --> 50:57.040
and add Northumbria and Alba
to his conquests.

50:58.480 --> 51:03.920
This is a moment to join as one

51:04.840 --> 51:08.200
and confront the threat
from over-mighty Wessex

51:08.280 --> 51:13.680
before our lands are swallowed
by this dream of England.

51:16.560 --> 51:19.320
- What say you, Lord Edmund of Jarrow?
- Aye.

51:19.400 --> 51:22.200
- Aelfgar of Berwick?
- I will swear also.

51:24.280 --> 51:25.240
What’s your name?

51:27.400 --> 51:29.240
Wihtgar, my lord.

51:30.280 --> 51:31.520
Wihtgar of Bebbanburg.
