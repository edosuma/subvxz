00:06.320 --> 00:08.860
* Michael Rennie was ill *

00:08.960 --> 00:11.710
* The day the earth stood still *

00:11.920 --> 00:16.140
* But he told us where we stand *

00:17.110 --> 00:19.820
* And Flash Gordon was there *

00:19.940 --> 00:22.500
* In silver underwear *

00:22.670 --> 00:26.700
* Claude rains was
the invisible man *

00:27.880 --> 00:30.470
* Then something went wrong *

00:30.550 --> 00:33.100
* For fay Wray and king Kong *

00:33.260 --> 00:37.560
* They got caught
in a celluloid jam *

00:38.410 --> 00:41.379
* Then at a deadly pace *

00:41.380 --> 00:44.170
* It came from outer space *

00:44.470 --> 00:48.400
* And this is how
the message ran *

00:51.300 --> 00:54.710
* Science fiction *

00:56.700 --> 01:00.150
* Double feature *

01:05.190 --> 01:10.310
* To the late night
double feature *

01:10.350 --> 01:15.080
* Picture show. *

01:23.150 --> 01:25.750
* In the velvet darkness *

01:25.810 --> 01:28.020
* Of the blackest night *

01:28.270 --> 01:31.000
* Burning bright *

01:31.380 --> 01:37.080
* There's a guiding star *

01:37.470 --> 01:40.130
* No matter what *

01:40.810 --> 01:43.190
* Or who *

01:43.260 --> 01:48.640
* Who you are *

01:49.050 --> 01:52.710
* There's a light *

01:52.930 --> 01:57.050
* Over at the frankenstein place *

01:57.100 --> 02:03.480
* There's a light *

02:03.530 --> 02:07.480
* Burning in the fireplace *

02:07.570 --> 02:10.600
* There's a light *

02:10.710 --> 02:16.040
* Light in the darkness *

02:16.100 --> 02:19.870
* Of everybody... *

02:20.160 --> 02:22.529
Schuester, you messing
with my woman?

02:22.530 --> 02:24.060
I... I thought we had a deal.

02:25.630 --> 02:28.510
This is the face of a
guy who stepped in it.

02:28.580 --> 02:29.720
How did it get to this?

02:29.721 --> 02:32.010
How did a production of
Rocky Horror turn into...

02:33.380 --> 02:34.970
Ugh...My horror?

02:35.150 --> 02:36.610
It all started a week ago.

02:36.820 --> 02:37.870
Hey, Em. Hi.

02:38.010 --> 02:40.830
What's with your crusts?

02:41.050 --> 02:42.410
You-you always cut them off.

02:44.440 --> 02:45.962
I must have forgotten
this morning.

02:46.440 --> 02:47.110
Forgot?

02:48.470 --> 02:50.350
Carl and I had the
most amazing weekend.

02:50.410 --> 02:51.570
We hit the revival theater

02:51.571 --> 02:54.780
downtown for the midnight
show of Rocky Horror.

02:55.900 --> 02:56.580
You're kidding.

02:56.640 --> 02:57.490
No.

02:57.491 --> 02:59.720
Isn't that where everyone
dresses up and yells stuff?

02:59.721 --> 03:00.680
Yes, yeah.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.072
I mean, well, we don't dress up.

03:02.590 --> 03:03.700
At least not yet.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.240
Wait, isn't that
theater a total dive?

03:07.241 --> 03:08.430
It's disgusting, it's horrible.

03:08.431 --> 03:09.160
I know. I mean, there isn't

03:09.161 --> 03:10.050
a surface that isn't

03:10.051 --> 03:11.590
covered in spilled soda,
so you'd think

03:11.591 --> 03:12.800
it'd be a nightmare for me, right?

03:12.801 --> 03:14.869
But I don't know,
I'm having so much fun

03:14.870 --> 03:16.140
that I don't even notice.

03:23.330 --> 03:24.540
Mm. And get this.

03:24.541 --> 03:25.560
You know how I've always been

03:25.561 --> 03:26.600
very anti-Halloween

03:26.601 --> 03:28.770
'cause it totally freaks me out
to think about eating candy

03:28.771 --> 03:30.139
that someone else
has touched, right?

03:30.140 --> 03:33.529
Well, Carl and I are gonna
dress up as characters

03:33.530 --> 03:35.520
from the show,
and we're actually gonna

03:35.521 --> 03:36.440
go trick-or-treating!

03:36.570 --> 03:37.700
The sandwich,

03:37.890 --> 03:41.000
the dirty theater...
he's actually making her better.

03:41.001 --> 03:42.260
...Go as Janet, because obviously,

03:42.261 --> 03:44.050
she's a ginger... he's winning.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.009
Why the hell didn't I think of
taking her to that damn show?

03:47.270 --> 03:49.429
Oh, it's so weird

03:49.430 --> 03:50.990
that you brought up how
much you love that show,

03:50.991 --> 03:53.300
because just last weekend,

03:53.330 --> 03:56.229
I decided to have the glee
club perform Rocky Horror

03:56.230 --> 03:57.665
for the school musical this year.

03:58.380 --> 03:59.829
Wow, Will. Yeah.

03:59.830 --> 04:02.169
Cool, right? It's very, very cool.

04:02.170 --> 04:03.469
That's so... I mean,

04:03.470 --> 04:05.960
who knew that Rocky Horror was
so important to both of us?

04:05.961 --> 04:08.030
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

04:10.020 --> 04:12.039
Isn't there some
pretty risqué material

04:12.040 --> 04:13.040
in there, though?

04:14.568 --> 04:16.089
Yeah, I mean,
I'll probably have to

04:16.091 --> 04:17.230
make some edits here and there,

04:17.231 --> 04:18.700
but it's worth it to
expose the kids to

04:18.701 --> 04:21.149
one of my favorite
musicals of all time.

04:21.690 --> 04:22.970
Yeah. I love that show.

04:22.971 --> 04:23.990
Wow, yeah. Mm.

04:25.006 --> 04:27.789
Well, I'm thinking you're gonna
have to edit the whole thing out

04:27.790 --> 04:29.919
if you're gonna get Sue and
Figgins to sign off on it.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.380
But, um, that's really exciting.

04:32.990 --> 04:33.760
Right.

04:33.890 --> 04:35.190
Let's go, Rocky Horror.

04:36.390 --> 04:37.970
Oh, um, yep. Yeah.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.570
So what are you gonna be
for Halloween this year?

04:47.720 --> 04:49.530
I'm going as a peanut allergy.

04:50.130 --> 04:51.620
Great news, guys.

04:52.050 --> 04:53.490
I've had a little inspiration.

04:53.610 --> 04:56.510
This week's musical lesson
isn't really a lesson.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.320
It's a musical.

04:58.321 --> 04:59.780
Oh, please be Evita,
please be Evita...

04:59.781 --> 05:00.870
Rocky Horror.

05:01.870 --> 05:02.990
I've never seen it.

05:03.840 --> 05:04.970
Mr. Shue. Yep?

05:05.090 --> 05:06.769
While I admire your choice

05:06.770 --> 05:08.380
of the groundbreaking
'70s musical,

05:08.381 --> 05:10.100
aren't you worried
that the adult themes

05:10.101 --> 05:11.389
might be a point of controversy?

05:11.390 --> 05:13.760
Seriously. A school in Texas
couldn't even do rent.

05:13.761 --> 05:15.959
It caused an outrage and
they had to cancel the show.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.569
Isn't that the whole
point of the arts?

05:17.570 --> 05:19.199
Pushing boundaries, doing things

05:19.200 --> 05:20.570
people say you can't
do for the sake of

05:20.571 --> 05:21.550
self-expression?

05:22.050 --> 05:23.430
I got it all figured out.

05:23.431 --> 05:25.349
I cut out some of the
more risqué sections.

05:25.350 --> 05:28.059
And I'm sending home
permission slips

05:28.060 --> 05:30.259
to all your parents to make
sure that they're okay with it.

05:30.260 --> 05:34.109
And we're going to charge
admission and use the proceeds

05:34.110 --> 05:35.010
to help pay for transportation

05:35.011 --> 05:37.040
to nationals in New York.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.790
Okay, let's talk about casting.

05:40.890 --> 05:42.629
Oh, finn and I will
play Brad and Janet.

05:42.660 --> 05:44.469
Ah! And I'll be playing

05:44.470 --> 05:45.810
the guy in the wheelchair, right?

05:45.811 --> 05:46.799
That's what I was thinking.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.509
And I thought Kurt could play

05:48.510 --> 05:49.579
the role of Frank-n-furter.

05:49.580 --> 05:51.119
No. There's no way

05:51.120 --> 05:53.970
I'm playing a transvestite
in high heels and fishnets

05:54.210 --> 05:55.240
and wearing lipstick.

05:55.241 --> 05:57.200
Why? 'Cause that
look was last season?

05:57.640 --> 05:58.460
I'll do it.

05:59.100 --> 05:59.970
Really?

06:00.020 --> 06:01.380
It's, like, the male lead.

06:01.450 --> 06:03.949
I know, but I'm feeling
a little more confident

06:03.950 --> 06:05.909
about my singing voice
after our duets project.

06:05.910 --> 06:07.900
Great! I have no
problem with that.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.860
Now, we're a little
short on female roles,

06:09.910 --> 06:12.606
so we're going to have to double
up on columbias and magentas.

06:12.630 --> 06:14.180
It's standard
practice on Broadway.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.820
It'll preserve your voices.

06:16.110 --> 06:17.330
I'd like to preserve you.

06:17.390 --> 06:18.410
In a jar.

06:18.550 --> 06:19.670
In my basement.

06:19.710 --> 06:20.540
Sam.

06:21.050 --> 06:23.050
I'd like you to play the
role of the creature.

06:23.060 --> 06:24.400
From the black lagoon?

06:24.450 --> 06:26.999
Rocky. He's like the
frankenstein character,

06:27.000 --> 06:28.920
but blond. You'll kill the part.

06:28.970 --> 06:30.530
He's cute, just like you.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.189
Better start working on those abs.

06:32.190 --> 06:34.712
Are you kidding me? You could
cut glass with these babies.

06:34.860 --> 06:36.512
I have no problem
showing off my body.

06:37.190 --> 06:40.140
Okay. Looks like we
got ourselves a show.

06:41.950 --> 06:44.949
So then after the time warp,
riff raff aka Kurt

06:44.950 --> 06:46.730
takes us to Frank-n-furter's lab.

06:48.070 --> 06:50.289
I have no idea what's
going on in this script,

06:50.290 --> 06:52.180
and it's not in a cool
inception kind of way.

06:52.181 --> 06:52.910
Just try, okay?

06:52.980 --> 06:55.250
All right, so, then they
take off our wet clothes,

06:55.251 --> 06:57.381
and we do the rest of the
scene in our underwear.

06:58.370 --> 07:00.029
Wait, I'm in my tighty-whities?

07:00.030 --> 07:00.540
Yeah.

07:01.990 --> 07:04.179
I can't be on stage,

07:04.180 --> 07:05.110
in front of the whole school

07:05.111 --> 07:06.459
in my tighty-whities. They're...

07:06.460 --> 07:08.260
Gonna be able to see my whole...

07:09.300 --> 07:10.050
Business.

07:10.051 --> 07:12.169
Come on. It will just be
like going to the pool.

07:12.170 --> 07:13.670
I wear a swim shirt at the pool.

07:13.810 --> 07:16.027
I tell everybody it's because
I burn easily, but...

07:17.470 --> 07:18.920
Look... I know I'm a big athlete,

07:18.921 --> 07:20.450
and it's not manly or anything...

07:22.930 --> 07:24.830
But I'm kind of insecure
about how I look.

07:28.130 --> 07:29.190
Come on. You just...

07:30.190 --> 07:31.973
You know, you have a
different body type.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.740
I don't look like
Brittany or santana,

07:33.741 --> 07:35.263
but you still think
I'm hot, right?

07:36.180 --> 07:37.420
Yeah, of course.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.320
So, then...

07:38.620 --> 07:40.580
You're just going
to have to trust me

07:40.581 --> 07:43.260
that you're the
hottest guy in school.

07:44.930 --> 07:45.620
Okay?

07:45.800 --> 07:46.580
Okay. Come her

07:48.100 --> 07:48.930
all right.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.740
So, then after that,

07:50.758 --> 07:52.280
Frank-n-furter's
going to come down

07:52.281 --> 07:54.550
and elevator,
and when he comes down,

07:54.600 --> 07:55.700
we are scared.

07:55.740 --> 07:57.330
I might faint.
Maybe a couple times.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.319
...Making it the zoo's first

08:01.320 --> 08:04.859
unitarian chimp wedding
in over six years.

08:04.860 --> 08:07.550
And we certainly
wish the couple well.

08:08.330 --> 08:11.670
And now, let's mosey on
over to Sue's corner.

08:12.030 --> 08:13.340
Take it away, Sue.

08:13.350 --> 08:14.410
Thanks, .

08:14.540 --> 08:16.910
You know, Halloween
is fast approaching,

08:16.950 --> 08:18.890
the day when parents
encourage little boys

08:18.891 --> 08:20.450
to dress like little girls,

08:20.490 --> 08:22.540
and little girls to
dress like whores,

08:22.590 --> 08:25.499
and go door-to-door,
browbeating hardworking Americans

08:25.500 --> 08:26.890
into giving them free food.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.630
Well you know what, Western Ohio?

08:28.670 --> 08:31.490
We've lost the true
meaning of Halloween.

08:31.710 --> 08:32.520
Fear.

08:33.090 --> 08:35.188
Halloween is that
magical day of the year

08:35.190 --> 08:37.590
when a child is told their
grandmother's a demon

08:37.650 --> 08:39.450
who's been feeding
them rat casserole

08:39.451 --> 08:41.890
with a crunchy garnish
of their own scabs.

08:41.919 --> 08:43.470
Children must know fear.

08:43.510 --> 08:45.539
Without it, they won't
know how to behave.

08:45.540 --> 08:46.820
They'll try frenching
grizzly bears

08:46.821 --> 08:48.290
or consider living in Florida.

08:48.530 --> 08:51.240
So, moms, skip
trick-or-treating this year,

08:51.270 --> 08:53.620
and instead, sit your little
toddler down and explain

08:53.621 --> 08:55.050
that daddy's a hungry zombie,

08:55.200 --> 08:57.400
and before he went out
to sharpen his pitchfork,

08:57.480 --> 09:01.120
he whispered to mommy
that you looked delicious.

09:01.930 --> 09:04.590
And that's how Sue sees it.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.700
Sue, you're the cat's pajamas.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.040
And we'll be right back.

09:12.000 --> 09:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:21.260 --> 09:22.939
Hello, Sue. I'm Barry Jeffries.

09:22.940 --> 09:23.880
This is Tim Stanwick.

09:23.881 --> 09:26.519
We're the new local station
managers down at Wohn.

09:26.520 --> 09:27.400
Do you mind if we sit?

09:27.401 --> 09:29.510
We loved Sue's corner last night.

09:29.834 --> 09:30.660
Oh, yeah. You know,

09:30.661 --> 09:32.560
we come from the
world of cable news.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.769
And we have... ideas.

09:34.770 --> 09:37.190
You see, good news
is about information.

09:37.230 --> 09:39.890
But great news is about fear.

09:39.990 --> 09:41.540
For example... Tim! Hmm?

09:41.760 --> 09:44.969
Did you hear about the swarm
of africanized killer bees?

09:44.970 --> 09:46.449
No. Wouldn't it be awful

09:46.450 --> 09:48.659
to see an entire town overrun

09:48.660 --> 09:49.550
by killer bees?

09:49.551 --> 09:51.010
I'm sorry, did you just say, Tim,

09:51.011 --> 09:54.089
"an entire town overrun
by killer bees"?

09:54.090 --> 09:56.369
Well, I ju... there's your quote.

09:56.370 --> 09:57.690
And you can replace "killer bees"

09:57.691 --> 10:00.010
with whatever you want!
Terrorists!

10:00.050 --> 10:00.990
Mexicans!

10:00.991 --> 10:02.809
Mexican terrorists!

10:02.810 --> 10:03.590
Ants!

10:03.720 --> 10:06.190
Mexican terrorist ants!

10:16.250 --> 10:18.100
So, what can I do for you?

10:18.190 --> 10:21.040
Someone at this school is
seeking the stage rights

10:21.490 --> 10:25.320
to Rocky Horror as
this year's musical.

10:26.540 --> 10:28.170
I take it you know the show.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.860
When I was younger,
I took my sister to the show.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.759
The audience was so enraged

10:35.760 --> 10:38.100
at having a disabled
person in their midst,

10:38.320 --> 10:39.430
you know what they did?

10:39.540 --> 10:41.610
They threw toast at us.

10:45.133 --> 10:46.350
You want me to shut it down?

10:46.351 --> 10:48.530
No. No.

10:49.390 --> 10:52.779
We want you to do an expos?
Proving that the secular

10:52.780 --> 10:55.770
progressive agenda has
finally arrived here

10:55.810 --> 10:57.999
in the Lima, Ohio,
school district.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.560
Sue, it's got a local
Emmy written all over it.

11:03.050 --> 11:03.940
We have a deal?

11:11.010 --> 11:13.399
All right, places,
Finn and Rachel.

11:13.400 --> 11:14.659
I want to start with
"damn it, Janet."

11:14.660 --> 11:16.079
Oh! I cannot wait till

11:16.080 --> 11:18.970
Finn takes his top off so we can
all see the hotness underneath.

11:18.971 --> 11:21.160
What are you talking about?
You can't have sloppy Joes

11:21.161 --> 11:23.552
every day for lunch and think
you can get away with it.

11:23.580 --> 11:25.480
Um... that's incredibly rude.

11:25.540 --> 11:27.400
Is it? Guys whisper
behind our backs

11:27.401 --> 11:29.330
about how we girls look every day.

11:29.340 --> 11:30.690
They objectify us all the time.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.909
He sort of has a point.
Yeah, earlier today,

11:32.910 --> 11:35.049
Artie asked if he could
make a gigantic omelet

11:35.050 --> 11:38.360
when I'm done with the ostrich
eggs I'm smuggling in my bra.

11:39.770 --> 11:42.990
I'm super looking forward to
seeing Sam in his gold bikini.

11:43.030 --> 11:44.570
It's gonna be ab-ulous.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.010
Can we get on with rehearsal,
please? Yeah!

11:46.011 --> 11:47.289
I agree! Yes.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.849
Let's stay focused, guys.
All right...

11:48.850 --> 11:51.929
Riff raff and Columbia
and magenta, team one.

11:51.930 --> 11:52.980
Take your places.

11:53.030 --> 11:54.850
Let's rock and roll.

11:56.440 --> 11:57.280
Hey, Janet...

11:57.340 --> 11:58.220
Yes, Brad?

11:59.230 --> 12:00.580
I've got something to say.

12:03.620 --> 12:04.840
I really loved the...

12:06.170 --> 12:07.240
Skillful way...

12:09.060 --> 12:10.750
You beat the other girls...

12:11.930 --> 12:13.330
To the bride's bouquet

12:14.150 --> 12:15.250
oh, Brad!

12:18.500 --> 12:21.460
* The river was deep,
but I swam it Janet... *

12:21.500 --> 12:24.630
* The future is ours,
so let's plan it Janet *

12:24.660 --> 12:27.720
* So please don't tell
me to can it Janet *

12:27.740 --> 12:29.020
* I've one thing to say *

12:29.021 --> 12:32.010
* And that's damn it,
Janet, I love you *

12:34.490 --> 12:37.539
* The road was long,
but I ran it Janet... *

12:37.540 --> 12:40.569
* There's a fire in my heart
and you fan it Janet *

12:40.570 --> 12:43.710
* If there's one fool for you,
then I am it Janet... *

12:43.760 --> 12:45.169
* I've one thing to say *

12:45.170 --> 12:48.260
* And that's damn it,
Janet, I love you *

12:50.730 --> 12:55.090
* Here's a ring to prove
that I'm no joker *

12:56.810 --> 13:02.230
* There's three ways
that love can grow *

13:02.800 --> 13:08.150
* That's good, bad or mediocre *

13:08.510 --> 13:12.680
* Oh, j-a-n-e-t, I love you so *

13:14.830 --> 13:18.190
* It's nicer than Betty Munroe had *
* Oh, Brad *

13:18.230 --> 13:21.300
* Now we're engaged and
I'm so glad Oh, Brad *

13:21.340 --> 13:24.309
* That you've met mom and
you know dad Oh, Brad *

13:24.310 --> 13:25.520
* I've one thing to say *

13:25.521 --> 13:29.410
* And that's Brad,
I'm mad for you, too... *

13:33.164 --> 13:33.990
What made you think

13:33.991 --> 13:36.643
you could get away with doing
this show without my knowledge?

13:37.910 --> 13:40.849
I didn't; I was hoping
just to run out the clock

13:40.850 --> 13:42.090
until it was too late to stop us.

13:42.091 --> 13:43.510
Who says I want to stop you?

13:44.020 --> 13:46.900
I appreciate how Rocky
Horror pushes boundaries.

13:48.139 --> 13:49.489
So you're not gonna fight us?

13:49.490 --> 13:50.940
Perhaps not.

13:51.090 --> 13:52.830
I just want to be involved, Will.

13:52.920 --> 13:54.330
The arts matter.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.830
Fine. Join us.

13:59.020 --> 14:00.920
Play the part of
the criminologist.

14:00.921 --> 14:02.130
We need someone with authority.

14:02.131 --> 14:02.980
Done. Great.

14:03.980 --> 14:05.090
We rehearse tonight.

14:05.091 --> 14:07.550
Fantastic. Give me
time to do my rewrites.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.789
I'm sorry? Yeah,
it says right here in my contract

14:10.790 --> 14:11.970
that I get final script approval.

14:11.971 --> 14:13.830
And I wouldn't fight it, Will.

14:14.110 --> 14:17.270
I'm a notary public.
See you on the boards, buddy.

14:24.060 --> 14:25.050
75...

14:25.390 --> 14:28.690
Chicken, egg whites,
fish... no salmon...

14:28.790 --> 14:31.460
oatmeal, brown rice,
but not after 6:00 P.M.

14:31.570 --> 14:34.430
No butter or oil and no soda.

14:35.650 --> 14:36.610
That's all you eat?

14:38.120 --> 14:39.880
Ain't no carpool lane to sexy.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.120
Damn straight.

14:41.330 --> 14:44.049
I don't know, man, I never
used to think about this stuff.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.439
I mean, we're guys.

14:45.440 --> 14:46.699
When did this start to matter?

14:46.700 --> 14:48.390
I personally blame the Internet.

14:48.391 --> 14:51.020
Once Internet porn was invented,
girls could watch without having

14:51.021 --> 14:53.200
to make that embarrassing
trip to the video store.

14:53.310 --> 14:55.229
Internet porn altered

14:55.230 --> 14:56.180
the female brain chemistry,

14:56.181 --> 14:57.311
making them more like men.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.720
And thus more concerned
with our bodies.

14:59.721 --> 15:02.279
But doesn't it get exhausting
thinking about what you eat,

15:02.280 --> 15:04.350
like, working out
like a madman? Nah.

15:05.080 --> 15:08.459
I mean, if I miss a workout or
eat a hot dog, I hate myself

15:08.460 --> 15:09.980
for a few days, but the fact is,

15:10.500 --> 15:14.269
if I want to be cool,
if I want to get Quinn for good,

15:14.270 --> 15:15.270
I got to look the part.

15:16.228 --> 15:17.880
You get up on that
stage and look like

15:17.881 --> 15:20.229
the Pillsbury doughboy,
no way you're staying popular.

15:21.060 --> 15:22.364
Come on, let's do some squats.

15:29.460 --> 15:32.025
I think maybe that's why Sue's
been such a bully all along.

15:32.210 --> 15:33.890
She really just wants
to be included.

15:38.840 --> 15:39.680
Listen...

15:40.230 --> 15:41.999
I really don't want to

15:42.000 --> 15:44.710
overstep my boundaries here,
but I really need your help.

15:45.220 --> 15:47.120
I-I need to find
all these costumes,

15:47.121 --> 15:49.010
and nobody knows Rocky
Horror like you.

15:51.010 --> 15:52.010
I don't know, would you

15:52.050 --> 15:54.070
mind coming on board
as my costume designer?

15:55.030 --> 15:57.840
Are you serious?
You're not kidding?

15:58.330 --> 16:00.360
I would love to! I'd love to!

16:00.450 --> 16:02.449
Well, it's gonna be a lot of work,

16:02.450 --> 16:04.150
and we're gonna be spending
a lot of time together.

16:04.151 --> 16:05.470
Yes, it's a dream come true!

16:05.840 --> 16:08.120
I mean, the costume designing
is a dream come true;

16:08.121 --> 16:10.200
Not the spending a lot of time...
not that spending a lot of time

16:10.201 --> 16:12.810
wouldn't be, but it... because
of Carl... I've got the Carl.

16:13.160 --> 16:14.690
Yeah, Carl. Yeah.

16:15.910 --> 16:18.019
Mr. Shue? My parents
read the script,

16:18.020 --> 16:19.890
and they're pulling me
out of Rocky Horror.

16:20.000 --> 16:20.790
What?

16:21.180 --> 16:23.759
I really want to do it,
but they're just not cool

16:23.760 --> 16:25.238
with me dressing up like a tranny.

16:25.970 --> 16:28.240
I hate to let you down,
but I'm out.

16:34.800 --> 16:35.590
Becky...

16:35.810 --> 16:37.590
That is the best Halloween costume

16:37.730 --> 16:38.900
I've ever seen.

16:38.901 --> 16:39.900
Thanks, coach.

16:40.320 --> 16:41.870
There's only one thing missing.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.140
Go scream at some fatties.

16:44.655 --> 16:47.090
Oh, and Becky, next year,
when you trick or treat as me,

16:47.091 --> 16:50.280
you'll need to be clutching a bright,
glittering local Emmy.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.580
Uh, Sue, I've got some bad news.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.850
We lost our Frank-n-furter,
and I can't find a replacement.

17:01.980 --> 17:02.950
Musical's canceled.

17:08.849 --> 17:11.470
Yeah, that's cute, that's good.
Look at this. See?

17:11.471 --> 17:12.888
I'm gonna have to
squeeze into this.

17:12.890 --> 17:14.569
They were out of the
latex panties, so I got

17:14.570 --> 17:15.930
the see-through, see? Look.

17:16.170 --> 17:20.660
Take your sick, perverted sex
games out of this school!

17:20.661 --> 17:21.959
No, no, no, Sue,
this is not what it looks like...

17:21.960 --> 17:23.010
I should have known.

17:23.060 --> 17:25.819
People who dress like librarians...
all sex addicts.

17:25.819 --> 17:26.819
I'm sorry. And you are?

17:27.680 --> 17:28.430
Oh, okay.

17:28.520 --> 17:30.609
Carl, meet Sue. Sue, this is

17:30.610 --> 17:31.580
my boyfriend Carl.

17:31.650 --> 17:34.130
Sue, how do you do?

17:35.610 --> 17:36.540
Okay.

17:36.630 --> 17:38.649
I was just showing Emma
my Halloween costume.

17:38.650 --> 17:40.600
We're both sort of
Rocky Horror fans.

17:40.601 --> 17:41.500
Sort of? Well...

17:41.501 --> 17:43.200
Yeah! Sort of? Please!

17:43.240 --> 17:46.259
Carl knows the lyrics to every
single song. Every song.

17:46.260 --> 17:47.720
He has an amazing voice,
too, so...

17:47.721 --> 17:49.480
Well, for a dentist.
For a dentist...

17:53.060 --> 17:53.890
You okay?

17:55.270 --> 17:56.579
Yeah, Carl, it's just...

17:56.580 --> 17:59.100
My heart is, uh...
is breaking just a little bit.

17:59.101 --> 18:00.760
I'm not sure if you
know this about me,

18:00.761 --> 18:03.720
but I am a huge proponent
of the arts in schools,

18:03.750 --> 18:06.010
and, well,
even at this very school,

18:06.050 --> 18:08.479
gosh, we're failing,
and, uh, you know,

18:08.480 --> 18:10.915
when the kids don't have arts,
they turn to drugs and...

18:10.990 --> 18:13.370
With drugs comes tooth loss and...

18:14.020 --> 18:16.220
Are you ready for a
chilling statistic?

18:17.150 --> 18:20.590
70% of all teeth in
this school are wooden.

18:20.890 --> 18:22.310
Seventy percent?

18:23.080 --> 18:24.602
Is there anything
I can do to help?

18:27.670 --> 18:28.780
I don't understand.

18:29.048 --> 18:30.570
Well, you guys have
a hole to fill,

18:30.571 --> 18:32.136
and I'm just trying
to help fill it.

18:32.420 --> 18:33.910
Wanky. Santana!

18:35.410 --> 18:38.710
Well, you know,
I can't just give you a role.

18:39.050 --> 18:40.060
You'd have to try out.

18:40.760 --> 18:42.970
Fair enough, but I'll
need a lady to sing to.

18:43.140 --> 18:43.930
Ems?

18:44.320 --> 18:45.040
Okay.

18:46.060 --> 18:47.420
"Hot patootie." B-flat.

18:54.050 --> 18:56.610
* Whatever happened
to Saturday night *

18:57.150 --> 18:59.520
* When you dressed up sharp
and you felt all right? *

18:59.670 --> 19:02.370
* It don't seem the same
since cosmic light *

19:02.570 --> 19:05.580
* Came into my life,
I thought I was divine *

19:05.780 --> 19:08.340
* I used to go for a ride
with a chick who'd go *

19:08.410 --> 19:11.230
* And listen to the
music on the radio *

19:11.310 --> 19:14.160
* A saxophone was blowin'
on a rock and roll show *

19:14.220 --> 19:17.240
* You'd climb in the back seat,
really had a good time *

19:18.710 --> 19:21.260
* Hot patootie, bless my soul *

19:21.870 --> 19:24.370
* I really love
that rock and roll *

19:24.640 --> 19:27.230
* Hot patootie, bless my soul *

19:27.650 --> 19:30.090
* I really love
that rock and roll *

19:38.920 --> 19:39.640
Come on.

19:39.641 --> 19:41.858
* My head used to swim from
the perfume I smelled *

19:41.880 --> 19:44.750
* My hands kind of fumbled
with her white plastic belt *

19:44.830 --> 19:46.560
* I'd taste her
baby pink lipstick *

19:46.561 --> 19:47.749
* And that's when I'd melt *

19:47.750 --> 19:50.330
* She whispered in my ear
tonight she really was mine *

19:50.950 --> 19:53.590
* Get back in front,
put some hair oil on *

19:53.720 --> 19:56.390
* Buddy holly was singing
his very last song *

19:56.520 --> 19:59.230
* With your arms around your girl,
you'd try to sing along *

19:59.310 --> 20:02.300
* You felt pretty good, whoo,
you really had a good time *

20:03.880 --> 20:06.540
* Hot patootie, bless my soul *

20:06.920 --> 20:09.350
* I really love
that rock and roll *

20:09.810 --> 20:12.360
* Hot patootie, bless my soul *

20:12.720 --> 20:15.320
* I really love
that rock and roll *

20:21.260 --> 20:23.890
* Hot patootie, bless my soul *

20:24.440 --> 20:26.930
* I really love
that rock and roll *

20:27.310 --> 20:29.820
* Hot patootie, bless my soul *

20:30.200 --> 20:32.830
* I really love
that rock and roll *

20:33.330 --> 20:35.750
* Hot patootie, bless my soul *

20:36.010 --> 20:38.530
* I really love
that rock and roll *

20:38.830 --> 20:41.480
* Hot patootie, bless my soul *

20:41.630 --> 20:44.370
* I really love that
rock and roll! *

20:49.050 --> 20:50.030
Yeah!

20:54.660 --> 20:56.430
No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.693
This will not do.

20:57.739 --> 20:58.913
Excuse me? For this musical

20:58.914 --> 21:01.659
to continue, we need a
Frank-n-furter, not an Eddie.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.711
Eddie was eliminated
in my rewrites.

21:04.381 --> 21:05.186
Sue's right.

21:05.668 --> 21:08.492
You want to play in our sandbox,
sing a Frank-n-furter number.

21:08.723 --> 21:11.095
Well, I'm sorry, bro,
but I think it's fine to wear

21:11.096 --> 21:13.442
that Frankie bustier in the
privacy of your own home...

21:13.443 --> 21:15.411
I'm freaky like that...
but don't you think it's a little

21:15.412 --> 21:17.912
inappropriate in a high school musical?
I mean, at least if I

21:17.913 --> 21:20.105
play Eddie, I won't have to
grind up against the students.

21:20.106 --> 21:22.117
You know, Eddie's
an important role.

21:22.118 --> 21:24.379
If I did it, I'd be showing
my support for the arts.

21:25.787 --> 21:27.570
Are you telling me how
to direct my show?

21:27.571 --> 21:28.646
Will, Will...

21:28.647 --> 21:29.468
Mr. Shue...

21:31.586 --> 21:34.130
I'd like to play Frank-n-furter.

21:34.945 --> 21:37.891
I was rereading the script
yesterday, and it said

21:37.892 --> 21:39.490
"don't dream it, be it."

21:39.924 --> 21:41.576
And it's my dream
to play a lead role,

21:41.577 --> 21:43.773
so I figure, why not me?

21:43.774 --> 21:46.275
I mean, I'd be all kind of
crazy sexy in that outfit.

21:46.276 --> 21:47.606
And I can reinterpret the

21:47.607 --> 21:49.895
number a little bit...
make it more modern.

21:51.657 --> 21:53.556
I'd really like the chance,
Mr. Shue.

21:53.887 --> 21:55.887
Well, there you go, Will.
You killed two birds

21:55.888 --> 21:58.099
with one stone here today...
congratulations.

21:58.100 --> 22:00.073
Look, you got yourself
a Frank-n-furter

22:00.074 --> 22:00.872
and an Eddie.

22:01.363 --> 22:02.566
This is outstanding.

22:11.039 --> 22:13.580
You ready for our first
dress rehearsal? Mm-hmm.

22:14.168 --> 22:16.300
Okay, guys... places!

22:20.568 --> 22:21.939
Uh, Mr. Shue?

22:22.710 --> 22:24.177
Uh... I know I'm supposed to be

22:24.245 --> 22:27.764
in my underwear for this scene,
and I'm totally down with that.

22:27.982 --> 22:31.001
I thought maybe I would save it
for the opening, if that's okay.

22:32.620 --> 22:34.687
Um, also, miss Pillsbury, is there

22:34.755 --> 22:36.188
a way I could...

22:36.189 --> 22:38.772
Wear, like, some gold
board shorts or something?

22:38.773 --> 22:39.651
These are really short.

22:39.652 --> 22:42.262
I'm afraid I'm gonna
show off some nuttage.

22:42.329 --> 22:43.596
Well... we'll take a note.

22:43.664 --> 22:44.964
We can't stop, guys.

22:45.372 --> 22:46.399
It's a dress rehearsal.

22:46.467 --> 22:47.834
Come on, keep going.

22:48.312 --> 22:49.380
And...

22:49.381 --> 22:50.065
Action!

22:50.066 --> 22:52.171
Oh, Brad, let's get out of here.

22:52.172 --> 22:55.794
I'm cold, I'm wet and
I'm just plain scared.

22:55.795 --> 22:56.569
Well, I'm here.

22:56.570 --> 22:57.918
There's nothing to worry about.

23:01.777 --> 23:03.801
* How do you do, I *

23:03.975 --> 23:06.079
* See you met my *

23:06.080 --> 23:08.515
* Faithful handyman *

23:09.376 --> 23:12.394
* He's just a little broke down *

23:12.771 --> 23:14.522
* 'Cause wouldn't you know *

23:14.920 --> 23:17.482
* He thought you
were the candy man *

23:19.396 --> 23:21.255
* Don't get strung out *

23:21.849 --> 23:23.842
* By the way I look *

23:23.843 --> 23:26.801
* Don't judge a
book by its cover *

23:28.319 --> 23:30.282
* I'm not much of a girl *

23:30.503 --> 23:31.789
* By the light of day *

23:31.790 --> 23:35.456
* But by night,
I'm one hell of a lover *

23:36.008 --> 23:39.648
* I'm just a sweet transvestite *

23:40.775 --> 23:43.956
* From sin... sational *

23:44.102 --> 23:46.839
* Transylvania *

23:49.338 --> 23:51.662
* Why don't you
stay for the night *

23:51.663 --> 23:52.341
Night.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.003
* Or maybe a bite *

23:54.004 --> 23:54.528
Bite.

23:54.983 --> 23:57.853
* I could show you my
favorite obsession *

23:58.525 --> 24:01.094
* I've been making a man *

24:01.095 --> 24:03.267
* With blond hair and a tan *

24:03.268 --> 24:06.818
* And he's good for
relieving my tension *

24:07.129 --> 24:10.218
* I'm just a sweet transvestite *

24:10.219 --> 24:11.952
* A sweet transvestite *

24:11.953 --> 24:15.064
* From sin... sational *

24:15.065 --> 24:18.271
* Transylvania *

24:18.272 --> 24:20.559
* Hey, hey *

24:20.560 --> 24:23.574
* I'm just a sweet transvestite *

24:23.575 --> 24:25.256
* A sweet transvestite *

24:25.257 --> 24:28.183
* From sin... sational *

24:28.418 --> 24:31.680
* Transylvania. *

24:35.278 --> 24:37.744
So, come up to the lab...

24:39.013 --> 24:40.980
...And see what's on the slab.

24:42.549 --> 24:44.884
I see you shiver with antici...

24:47.855 --> 24:48.755
...Pation! Pation!

24:49.823 --> 24:51.691
* But maybe the rain *

24:52.693 --> 24:54.694
* Isn't really to blame *

24:55.729 --> 24:57.997
* So I'll remove the cause *

25:01.268 --> 25:05.435
* But not the symptom! *

25:14.381 --> 25:15.657
Now that's an entrance.

25:15.658 --> 25:18.776
Mr. director,
I take that wall out right?

25:18.777 --> 25:20.620
You're two acts early, Carl.

25:20.621 --> 25:21.688
You're supposed to bust through

25:21.689 --> 25:22.689
the dinner party scene.

25:23.475 --> 25:24.408
Oh... well, actually,

25:24.409 --> 25:27.085
I was sort of feeling my
entrance in this scene.

25:27.451 --> 25:30.226
Such good, good,
interesting impulses.

25:30.227 --> 25:30.954
Emma: Oh!

25:31.254 --> 25:33.495
Bravo, Carl, bravo.

25:36.970 --> 25:38.231
Will?

25:38.232 --> 25:39.895
Hey, I got your note
you wanted to see me.

25:39.896 --> 25:41.316
We have a problem with the show.

25:41.375 --> 25:42.685
It's Carl.

25:43.184 --> 25:44.155
Really?

25:44.611 --> 25:46.471
I thought he was perfect.

25:46.677 --> 25:48.583
I agree, but, uh...

25:49.183 --> 25:50.650
What he said during his audition,

25:50.718 --> 25:52.719
it's-it's-it's-it's haunted me.

25:53.233 --> 25:54.244
He's right.

25:54.418 --> 25:57.007
Some of these parts are just
too adult for kids to play.

25:57.669 --> 26:00.291
Oh, yeah, well,
I have to agree, Will.

26:00.292 --> 26:01.568
You know? Especially Sam.

26:01.569 --> 26:02.312
Sam! Right.

26:02.313 --> 26:03.715
He seems so uncomfortable.

26:03.716 --> 26:04.764
I know. I... yeah.

26:04.832 --> 26:06.099
So I spoke with him.

26:06.100 --> 26:07.700
Is there something
wrong with my body?

26:07.701 --> 26:08.768
Your body's fine, Sam.

26:09.202 --> 26:11.089
But, frankly, I think the role's

26:11.090 --> 26:13.330
a little too risqué for a student.

26:14.842 --> 26:18.338
I did feel kind of... embarrassed.

26:19.646 --> 26:21.314
Who's gonna play Rocky?

26:23.047 --> 26:25.164
Uh, I guess I have to.

26:25.165 --> 26:26.192
I'm-I'm sorry?

26:26.855 --> 26:29.342
I figured if Carl can
play Eddie, then...

26:29.976 --> 26:31.788
I can play Rocky. Hmm.

26:31.789 --> 26:34.026
Thing is, I'm not as familiar

26:34.094 --> 26:35.395
with the libretto as you are,

26:35.462 --> 26:37.730
and I can really use
your help rehearsing.

26:38.578 --> 26:42.769
Uh... I'm... are-are you
sure that's a good idea?

26:42.770 --> 26:44.337
I mean, you'll be a great Rocky.

26:44.405 --> 26:47.473
You look really,
really great... h-healthy,

26:47.532 --> 26:49.282
but I mean, you're a teacher.

26:49.476 --> 26:51.208
Which is why I should do it.

26:51.209 --> 26:53.446
It will give the show a little
more credibility, you know?

26:53.447 --> 26:54.747
Oh.

26:54.799 --> 26:57.283
So... think you could help me out?

26:57.284 --> 26:58.851
I mean, I have to have
"touch-a touch me"

26:58.852 --> 27:00.853
down by rehearsal tomorrow.

27:03.893 --> 27:04.855
Yeah, okay.

27:04.856 --> 27:05.641
Okay?

27:06.904 --> 27:09.586
Um... well, I guess,

27:09.587 --> 27:11.687
if you want to start over there,

27:11.688 --> 27:13.487
and I will start here.

27:13.488 --> 27:14.479
Right. Good, good,
good, good. Good.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.299
So let's just, uh, just imagine

27:16.300 --> 27:19.502
that we're all alone in
Frank-n-furter's laboratory...

27:19.503 --> 27:20.451
Alone. Okay.

27:23.644 --> 27:26.479
* I was feeling done in *

27:27.929 --> 27:29.573
* Couldn't win *

27:31.183 --> 27:35.823
* I'd only ever kissed before... *

27:36.657 --> 27:38.420
You mean she...?
Uh-huh.

27:38.421 --> 27:41.694
* I felt there's no use getting *

27:42.221 --> 27:45.565
* Into heavy sweating *

27:45.632 --> 27:49.996
* It only leads to trouble and *

27:50.165 --> 27:52.407
* Bad fretting *

27:52.408 --> 27:54.945
* Now all I want to know *

27:55.822 --> 27:58.526
* Is how to go *

27:58.527 --> 28:02.066
* I've tasted blood
and I want more *

28:02.067 --> 28:04.453
* More, more, more *

28:04.619 --> 28:07.376
* I'll put up no resistance *

28:07.377 --> 28:10.448
* I want to stay the distance *

28:10.449 --> 28:13.514
* I've got an itch to scratch *

28:13.515 --> 28:16.112
* I need assistance *

28:16.113 --> 28:18.863
* Touch-a, touch-a,
touch-a touch me *

28:18.864 --> 28:21.505
* I want to be dirty *

28:21.506 --> 28:24.303
* Thrill me, chill me,
fulfill me *

28:24.304 --> 28:27.310
* Creature of the night *

28:31.747 --> 28:34.407
* Then if anything shows *

28:34.955 --> 28:37.625
* While you pose *

28:37.626 --> 28:40.999
* I'll oil you up
and drop you down *

28:41.000 --> 28:43.387
* Down, down, down *

28:43.571 --> 28:46.739
* And that's just
one small fraction *

28:46.906 --> 28:49.199
* Of the main attraction *

28:49.200 --> 28:52.156
Oh! *I want a friendly man *

28:52.637 --> 28:55.210
* And I need action *

28:55.211 --> 28:57.770
* Touch-a, touch-a,
touch-a touch me *

28:57.972 --> 29:00.754
* I want to be dirty *

29:00.755 --> 29:03.469
* Thrill me, chill me,
fulfill me *

29:03.470 --> 29:06.239
* Creature of the night *

29:06.240 --> 29:08.927
* Touch-a, touch-a,
touch-a touch me *

29:08.928 --> 29:11.816
* I want to be dirty *

29:11.817 --> 29:14.645
* Thrill me, chill me,
fulfill me *

29:14.646 --> 29:16.168
* Creature of the night *

29:16.169 --> 29:17.337
Uh-huh! Oh!

29:17.338 --> 29:19.764
* Touch-a, touch-a,
touch-a touch me *

29:19.765 --> 29:22.932
* Oh, I want to be dirty *

29:22.933 --> 29:25.516
* Thrill me, chill me,
fulfill me *

29:25.517 --> 29:28.385
* Creature of the night... *

29:28.386 --> 29:31.199
* Creature of the night *

29:31.200 --> 29:33.747
* Creature of the night *

29:33.978 --> 29:36.284
* Creature of the night *

29:36.794 --> 29:39.038
* Creature of the night*

29:39.712 --> 29:42.046
* Creature of the night *

29:42.406 --> 29:44.833
* Creature of the night *

29:44.834 --> 29:47.231
* Creature... of the night *

29:47.918 --> 29:50.390
* Creature of the night! *

29:53.660 --> 29:54.988
I...

29:55.262 --> 29:56.329
I, uh...

29:56.396 --> 29:57.430
I... I, uh...

30:09.074 --> 30:10.041
Whoa, whoa...

30:10.108 --> 30:11.042
Ah, wow, yeah.

30:11.109 --> 30:12.077
I would've had it.

30:12.078 --> 30:13.844
Yeah, sure. Not that big.

30:13.845 --> 30:14.831
Where you been? You're late.

30:14.832 --> 30:16.232
Sorry. I spaced.

30:17.237 --> 30:19.199
I'm not playing Rocky anymore.

30:19.440 --> 30:21.238
You're kidding. Who is?

30:21.698 --> 30:22.977
Mr. Shue.

30:23.908 --> 30:24.971
I totally blew this.

30:24.972 --> 30:27.388
I shouldn't have made all those
demands about my costume.

30:27.389 --> 30:28.568
I just feel, I feel fat,

30:28.569 --> 30:31.695
like I had rolls hanging
over those gold shorts.

30:31.763 --> 30:33.330
But you're in perfect shape, dude.

30:34.167 --> 30:35.274
Wait, since I said

30:35.275 --> 30:36.855
I'm uncomfortable in
the tighty-whities,

30:36.856 --> 30:38.311
does that mean I'm gonna
get replaced next?

30:38.312 --> 30:39.548
No, you don't have
to worry about that.

30:39.549 --> 30:41.020
The "Brad" part isn't
about looking hot.

30:41.021 --> 30:43.596
It's about being confident in
who you are and how you look,

30:43.597 --> 30:45.083
no matter how douchey you are.

30:45.410 --> 30:47.727
That's guy's totally
cool being uncool.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.919
Yeah, I'm definitely not there.

30:50.193 --> 30:52.193
I actually started
showering with my shirt on.

30:52.194 --> 30:53.464
Look, stop knocking
yourself out in here.

30:53.465 --> 30:56.462
Just be you and the
sexy will flow through.

30:56.463 --> 30:57.441
Yeah.

30:58.692 --> 31:00.038
Yeah, you're right.

31:02.209 --> 31:04.470
I don't need to hide behind
my muscles, like you do.

31:04.471 --> 31:05.228
Awesome.

31:06.692 --> 31:07.407
I think.

31:07.623 --> 31:08.731
Are you insulting me?

31:09.067 --> 31:10.300
Where are you going?

31:11.486 --> 31:13.924
To show everyone how
hot and sexy I am.

31:19.644 --> 31:20.965
Oh, wow.

31:21.325 --> 31:23.861
Damn those cool ranch doritos.

31:23.973 --> 31:26.973
Eddie... I've seen him.

31:27.085 --> 31:28.326
Eddie?

31:28.327 --> 31:31.597
What do you know of Eddie,
Dr. Scott?

31:31.598 --> 31:32.823
I happen to know a great deal

31:32.824 --> 31:34.200
about a lot of things.

31:34.201 --> 31:35.377
You see...

31:35.605 --> 31:38.395
Eddie happens to be my nephew.

31:38.953 --> 31:40.123
This play is terrible.

31:40.124 --> 31:41.524
Finn's line: "Dr. Scott!"

31:42.152 --> 31:42.860
Janet!

31:42.861 --> 31:44.695
Dr. Scott! Will:
Finn's line: "Janet!"

31:44.696 --> 31:46.442
I'm so bored I just
fell into a micro-sleep.

31:46.443 --> 31:47.736
Brad! Rocky!

31:48.594 --> 31:50.939
Janet. Dr. Scott!

31:50.940 --> 31:52.176
Still being Finn: "Janet!"

31:52.177 --> 31:54.077
Brad! None of this is plausible.

31:54.078 --> 31:54.979
Rocky!

31:55.692 --> 31:56.960
Janet! Dr. Scott!

31:56.961 --> 31:58.558
Finn's line: "Janet!" Brad!

31:58.559 --> 31:59.274
Rocky.

32:00.378 --> 32:02.469
This play has incredible
pacing problems.

32:02.470 --> 32:04.063
Mr. Shue, it is pointless

32:04.064 --> 32:05.815
to rehearse this
scene without Finn.

32:05.816 --> 32:06.765
We don't have a choice.

32:06.766 --> 32:08.280
He's late and he's not
answering his phone.

32:08.281 --> 32:10.177
We gotta get this
timing down, guys.

32:10.720 --> 32:14.406
And would you please stop
interjecting your opinions, Sue?

32:14.407 --> 32:16.665
Opinions? These are my rewrites.

32:17.094 --> 32:20.266
William, I'd like to see
you in my office, please.

32:22.971 --> 32:24.395
Suspended? For what?

32:25.967 --> 32:28.858
I sort of walked down the hall
in my Rocky Horror costume.

32:46.051 --> 32:48.671
Whoa! Nice panties, baby Huey!

32:48.672 --> 32:50.238
Hey, my grandpa Murray called.

32:50.239 --> 32:51.845
He wants his boxers back.

32:56.192 --> 32:57.349
Why would you do that?

32:57.350 --> 32:59.584
I was trying to get
comfortable in my costume.

32:59.585 --> 33:01.435
You don't understand how
hard it is for us guys

33:01.436 --> 33:03.065
to be exposed like that.

33:03.672 --> 33:05.889
Just thought maybe it would
make me feel hot enough

33:05.890 --> 33:08.106
to get up on stage and
sing in my underwear.

33:08.107 --> 33:10.250
I'm recommending one
month's suspension

33:10.251 --> 33:14.472
and summer school to make
up for any lost class time.

33:14.646 --> 33:16.561
Can we have a moment alone please?

33:20.250 --> 33:21.571
You can't do this to him.

33:21.572 --> 33:23.074
He was just coming to
rehearsal in his costume...

33:23.075 --> 33:24.136
that's not a crime.

33:24.137 --> 33:26.401
Nine children have
already signed up

33:26.402 --> 33:27.698
for after-school therapy.

33:27.699 --> 33:29.548
I had to bring in
a grief counselor.

33:29.549 --> 33:31.875
Last year when the cheerios!
Won the national championship,

33:31.876 --> 33:33.233
Santana pantsed Brittany,

33:33.234 --> 33:35.711
and she was wearing a lot
less than her underwear.

33:35.762 --> 33:37.110
Neither of them were suspended.

33:37.111 --> 33:39.210
That was in the middle
of a celebration.

33:39.211 --> 33:41.355
But there's still a precedent.

33:41.356 --> 33:41.986
Huh?

33:41.987 --> 33:43.764
Fine. A warning.

33:43.765 --> 33:44.654
Thank you.

33:44.655 --> 33:45.722
William?

33:46.295 --> 33:47.348
To be honest,

33:47.349 --> 33:50.425
your motivations for doing this
production are murky to me,

33:50.426 --> 33:52.235
considering all
that you're risking

33:52.236 --> 33:53.814
if something goes too far.

33:53.815 --> 33:54.637
What are you saying?

33:54.638 --> 33:56.678
I'm saying that you're welcome
to continue with this,

33:56.679 --> 33:58.687
but if you get any heat about it,

33:58.688 --> 34:00.372
I won't be able to protect you.

34:00.373 --> 34:02.411
You're putting you
and your glee club

34:02.412 --> 34:05.145
on the line,
and I want you to be sure

34:05.146 --> 34:07.767
that whatever you're
doing it for is worth it.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.196
Finn & Rachel: *There's a... *

34:13.197 --> 34:14.043
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:14.045 --> 34:16.512
Schuester, you messing
with my woman?

34:16.513 --> 34:17.795
I thought we had a deal.

34:18.918 --> 34:19.975
I, uh...

34:19.976 --> 34:21.538
I-I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

34:21.539 --> 34:22.447
Yes, you do,

34:22.447 --> 34:23.060
because Emma and I have

34:23.061 --> 34:25.732
a full disclosure policy...
total honesty.

34:25.733 --> 34:26.880
Something that allows us
to have a little thing

34:26.882 --> 34:28.868
I like to call intimacy.

34:28.869 --> 34:30.701
Something you clearly
know nothing about.

34:30.956 --> 34:32.261
Look, we were just rehearsing.

34:32.262 --> 34:33.438
Stop it, bro.

34:33.638 --> 34:35.585
Man-to-man, you gave me your word.

34:35.886 --> 34:37.414
So, what, you quitting the show?

34:37.415 --> 34:38.335
No, no, no, no.

34:38.335 --> 34:40.451
Unlike you I believe in
the power of the arts.

34:40.452 --> 34:42.713
I don't just use them to
pick up other guys' chicks.

34:54.659 --> 34:56.126
Trick or treat!

34:57.074 --> 35:01.288
Oh, geez, Becky, I forgot that
"take back the night club"

35:01.289 --> 35:02.996
was going door-to-door
this evening.

35:02.997 --> 35:04.800
I want my chocolate bar.

35:04.801 --> 35:06.223
I'm sorry.

35:06.224 --> 35:08.074
I've been working so
hard on Rocky Horror,

35:08.075 --> 35:09.741
I forgot to buy candy.

35:09.742 --> 35:13.090
Rocky Horror is an abomination.

35:14.838 --> 35:16.035
What did you just say?

35:16.036 --> 35:19.080
That's what coach Sue
says on her tape.

35:19.081 --> 35:21.900
It's in her office. I'll show you.

35:24.703 --> 35:26.407
So I went undercover to expose

35:26.408 --> 35:29.034
what your tax dollars are
funding in our public schools

35:29.035 --> 35:31.129
in the name of the arts.

35:31.484 --> 35:33.499
Now, I'm all about
personal freedom.

35:33.500 --> 35:34.775
I've publicly voiced my support

35:34.776 --> 35:37.363
for that lady who wants
to marry her own sores.

35:37.364 --> 35:39.840
But just because you're free
to say whatever you want,

35:39.841 --> 35:41.509
doesn't always mean you should.

35:41.510 --> 35:44.175
Artists are free to push
boundaries to make art.

35:44.176 --> 35:46.486
But when pushing boundaries
is their only aim,

35:46.487 --> 35:48.354
the result is usually bad art.

35:48.355 --> 35:50.187
There's a time and a
place for everything,

35:50.188 --> 35:51.362
and squeamishness about what

35:51.363 --> 35:54.750
we want our children exposed
to is not the same as bigotry.

35:54.751 --> 35:56.744
Freedom-loving adults are
free to have an open,

35:56.745 --> 35:59.909
lively debate about what
we want our society to be.

35:59.910 --> 36:03.630
But let's not make our children
fight the culture war for us.

36:03.719 --> 36:05.589
They deserve a little
bit better than that.

36:05.642 --> 36:08.516
And that's... how Sue sees it.

36:08.956 --> 36:12.486
Give me chocolate
or I will cut you.

36:18.212 --> 36:20.415
Sue, you set me up.

36:20.416 --> 36:21.367
Hey, there, William.

36:21.368 --> 36:23.266
Root through anyone's
personal belongings lately?

36:23.267 --> 36:24.529
When were you planning
on airing that?

36:24.530 --> 36:26.688
Opening night.
That's why I pretaped it.

36:26.931 --> 36:28.667
Oh, I know you're furious, Will.

36:29.038 --> 36:30.354
But do you honestly believe

36:30.355 --> 36:33.080
anything I said was unreasonable?

36:33.081 --> 36:34.008
Well...

36:36.501 --> 36:37.377
No.

36:37.671 --> 36:40.337
There are limits, Will.
There is a line.

36:40.338 --> 36:43.161
And for reasons I suspect have
nothing to do with your kids,

36:43.162 --> 36:44.353
you crossed it.

36:45.109 --> 36:46.329
You can't yell fire

36:46.330 --> 36:48.413
in a crowded theatre,
and you can't expose kids

36:48.414 --> 36:49.548
to material like this.

36:49.549 --> 36:51.021
Not on the taxpayer's dime.

36:51.022 --> 36:52.272
Oh, please, Sue!

36:52.842 --> 36:54.688
They have the Internet.
They are exposed!

36:54.689 --> 36:55.617
Don't lead them to it.

36:55.618 --> 36:57.897
Don't make it okay. They're kids!

36:57.898 --> 36:59.039
And now more than ever,
high school is

36:59.040 --> 37:00.989
a dangerous place,
and it's our job

37:00.990 --> 37:02.946
to guide them through it safely.

37:02.947 --> 37:04.653
And we still get to torture
them along the way.

37:04.654 --> 37:06.393
It's a fabulous system.

37:10.715 --> 37:11.597
You're right.

37:13.057 --> 37:14.688
I-I'm pulling the show.

37:15.406 --> 37:16.486
Wait. What?

37:16.487 --> 37:18.041
I'm canceling the show.

37:18.042 --> 37:20.037
You were right.
I was totally wrong.

37:20.038 --> 37:21.464
Well, shouldn't you wait
until opening night?

37:21.465 --> 37:23.312
I mean, the kids worked
so hard... sorry, Sue.

37:23.313 --> 37:25.062
Hey, do it for the kids, Will.

37:25.554 --> 37:27.948
I need that local Emmy, Will!

37:32.439 --> 37:34.675
Are you sure you want to
cancel the whole thing?

37:35.026 --> 37:37.461
I never should've tried to
put it on in the first place.

37:39.158 --> 37:41.183
The reality is...

37:41.888 --> 37:44.358
I only did all this
to get close to you.

37:47.102 --> 37:50.174
I guess love can make you
do some crazy things.

37:50.425 --> 37:51.385
You know?

37:54.897 --> 37:56.675
I'm sorry, Emma.

37:56.676 --> 38:01.143
And I promise to never abuse our
feelings for each other again.

38:01.144 --> 38:02.331
I mean, let's face it.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.938
Carl's actually making you better.

38:07.298 --> 38:09.072
And if I really love you...

38:11.266 --> 38:13.396
...I need to back off and
accept the fact that...

38:15.597 --> 38:16.899
At least for now,

38:18.158 --> 38:19.268
being with him

38:20.293 --> 38:21.840
is the best thing for you.

38:27.017 --> 38:29.020
So, what are you going
to tell the kids?

38:34.362 --> 38:35.661
I want to apologize

38:35.662 --> 38:37.441
for putting you guys
through all this...

38:37.687 --> 38:39.329
particularly Finn and Sam.

38:39.330 --> 38:40.506
It's cool, Mr. Shue.

38:40.507 --> 38:41.926
I'm sure the teasing will die down

38:41.927 --> 38:43.899
by the time my tenth
reunion rolls around.

38:43.900 --> 38:45.460
And I got asked to be June

38:45.461 --> 38:46.877
in the men of McKinley
high calendar.

38:46.878 --> 38:48.058
I'm happy for you.

38:49.386 --> 38:51.029
But we still can't do the musical.

38:51.253 --> 38:52.224
Look, I was wrong.

38:52.329 --> 38:53.112
Rocky Horror isn't

38:53.113 --> 38:57.419
about pushing boundaries or
making an audience accept

38:57.420 --> 38:59.127
a certain rebellious
point of view.

38:59.354 --> 39:00.876
Those were my reasons
for doing it,

39:01.295 --> 39:03.703
and they aren't worth risking
what we have here for.

39:06.567 --> 39:07.750
And when I was younger,

39:07.751 --> 39:09.879
and they started midnight
shows of Rocky Horror,

39:09.880 --> 39:11.760
it wasn't for envelope pushers.

39:12.617 --> 39:14.048
It was for outcasts,

39:14.297 --> 39:15.949
people on the fringes
who had no place

39:15.950 --> 39:18.507
left to go, but were
searching for someplace,

39:18.508 --> 39:21.234
anyplace, where they
felt like they belonged.

39:21.968 --> 39:23.022
Sound familiar?

39:25.291 --> 39:28.078
The truth is,
with that perspective,

39:28.985 --> 39:31.352
Rocky Horror is the perfect
show for this club.

39:31.353 --> 39:33.177
Well, then why aren't
we putting it on?

39:34.330 --> 39:36.156
We're still going to
perform Rocky Horror.

39:37.150 --> 39:38.971
We're just not doing
it for an audience.

39:38.972 --> 39:40.411
We're doing it for ourselves.

39:44.285 --> 39:46.820
It's astounding.

39:46.821 --> 39:49.466
Time is fleeting.

39:50.264 --> 39:54.346
Madness... takes its toll.

39:54.988 --> 39:57.318
But listen closely.

39:57.319 --> 40:00.072
Not for very much longer.

40:01.193 --> 40:05.109
I've got to keep control.

40:06.038 --> 40:10.541
* I remember doing the time-warp *

40:11.971 --> 40:15.770
* Drinking those moments when *

40:16.356 --> 40:18.801
* The blackness would hit me *

40:18.905 --> 40:21.967
*And a void would be calling *

40:22.719 --> 40:26.398
* Let's do the time-warp again *

40:28.282 --> 40:32.049
* Let's do the time-warp again! *

40:32.552 --> 40:34.359
It's just a jump to the left.

40:35.930 --> 40:38.628
* And then a step to the right *

40:38.629 --> 40:40.208
Put your hands on your hips.

40:41.270 --> 40:43.735
* You bring your knees in tight *

40:46.638 --> 40:49.549
That really drives you insane *

40:50.710 --> 40:54.392
* Let's do the time-warp again *

40:56.017 --> 41:00.659
* Let's do the time-warp again *

41:00.874 --> 41:03.347
* It's so dreamy *

41:03.348 --> 41:06.025
* Oh, fantasy free me *

41:06.239 --> 41:10.833
* So you can't see me,
no, not at all *

41:11.470 --> 41:14.098
* In another dimension *

41:14.099 --> 41:17.239
* With voyeuristic intentions *

41:17.500 --> 41:22.091
* Well secluded, oh,
I see it all *

41:22.726 --> 41:25.372
With a bit of a mind flip.

41:25.373 --> 41:28.820
You're into the time slip.

41:28.821 --> 41:33.094
And nothing can ever be the same.

41:33.471 --> 41:36.526
* You're spaced out
on sensation, ow! *

41:36.527 --> 41:39.718
* Like you're under sedation *

41:40.544 --> 41:43.850
* Let's do the time-warp again *

41:45.936 --> 41:49.820
* Let's do the time-warp again *

41:50.908 --> 41:53.582
* Well, I was walking down the
street just a-having a think *

41:53.583 --> 41:56.543
* When this snake of a guy
gave me an evil wink *

41:56.544 --> 41:58.960
* He shook me up,
he took me by surprise *

41:58.961 --> 42:02.000
* He had a pickup truck,
and the devil's eyes *

42:02.001 --> 42:04.658
* He stared at me and
I felt a change *

42:04.659 --> 42:07.619
* Time meant nothing,
never would again *

42:07.620 --> 42:12.457
* Let's do the time-warp again *

42:13.102 --> 42:16.995
* Let's do the time-warp again *

42:17.402 --> 42:19.048
It's just a jump to the left.

42:20.579 --> 42:23.400
* And then a step to the right *

42:23.401 --> 42:25.058
Put your hands on your hips.

42:26.057 --> 42:28.544
* You bring your knees in tight *

42:28.720 --> 42:30.938
* But it's the pelvic thrust

42:31.386 --> 42:33.826
that really drives you insane *

42:35.316 --> 42:39.351
* Let's do the time-warp again *

42:40.780 --> 42:44.331
* Let's do the time-warp again. *
