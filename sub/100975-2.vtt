WEBVTT

00:10.719 --> 00:13.138
[Tan] Okay, boys, do you want to know
who we're helping this week?

00:13.221 --> 00:14.097
[cheering]

00:14.180 --> 00:18.768
Are you for real? You're blinding me
with that light, Tanny, on the-- [screams]

00:18.852 --> 00:19.686
[laughs]

00:19.769 --> 00:22.313
-You're literally gonna blind me.
-[laughs]

00:22.397 --> 00:27.610
Okay, her name is Rahanna.
"She is 27, she's from Germantown, PA.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.905
Rahanna owns and operates
Stylish Pooch dog grooming."

00:30.989 --> 00:33.575
"Adding swag to your wag" is my slogan.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.578
If you want your dog pink,
or you want me to add some tiger stripes,

00:36.661 --> 00:38.538
I'm down for it. It's dog safe.

00:38.621 --> 00:39.706
Hi, Ben!

00:39.789 --> 00:42.042
People always say,
"You like dogs more than people."

00:42.292 --> 00:44.002
Kisses. Thank you.

00:44.169 --> 00:46.504
I would say... yes!<i> </i>[laughs]

00:46.588 --> 00:49.382
[Tan] "Rahanna was nominated
by her parents Jill and Kevin."

00:49.466 --> 00:50.341
Aww.

00:50.425 --> 00:54.012
She grew up in a household with animals.
They used to call us "The Zoo."

00:54.471 --> 00:57.515
She would come home from school,
she'd do dogs' hair.

00:57.599 --> 01:01.019
[Rahanna] I was a groomer at PetSmart
for seven years.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.772
On my off days, I would, like,
groom out of my house.

01:04.147 --> 01:07.150
I started to get a lot more clients,
and that's when I knew.

01:07.233 --> 01:10.028
I was like, "Okay, Rahanna,
you always wanted to be a mobile groomer.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.821
It's time to spread your wings and fly."

01:11.905 --> 01:13.948
She was like,
"Mom, do you think I should do it?"

01:14.032 --> 01:15.283
I said, "Yes, I do."

01:15.366 --> 01:17.035
Don't be scared to chase your dream.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.913
[Rahanna] It really was a leap of faith.
When I first started out,

01:19.996 --> 01:23.958
I would have my equipment, my table,
and I would groom out of clients' homes.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.336
I was starting to grow my business.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.922
[Jill]
During that time, she needed an assistant,

01:29.255 --> 01:31.257
'cause she was getting so much business.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.552
"She now works out of a 23-year-old RV."

01:35.303 --> 01:38.598
Hey! Hi, Diego. You ready?

01:38.973 --> 01:41.684
After a couple of months of having it,

01:41.851 --> 01:45.146
it broke down, and then things
just started, like, piling up after that.

01:45.688 --> 01:46.856
Tires went--

01:46.940 --> 01:48.483
-Then the brakes.
-Brakes.

01:48.566 --> 01:50.610
[Rahanna] The electricity would go.

01:50.985 --> 01:53.113
How much was the muffler to put back on?

01:53.530 --> 01:54.364
Like, 300.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.075
Those were rough. Yeah.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.161
Then somebody stole her generator.

02:00.245 --> 02:03.248
She does bounce back.
Things happen, and...

02:04.165 --> 02:08.878
I still have some loyal clients,
but I've lost a lot from not being mobile.

02:09.254 --> 02:13.550
For two years now, my RV has been parked
in front of my parents' house.

02:13.716 --> 02:15.135
It's just been sitting.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.303
-Oh.
-[Rahanna] I just feel like...

02:17.679 --> 02:21.641
All I want to do is
be a great business owner,

02:21.724 --> 02:23.143
[voice breaks] and I just always
feel like,

02:23.893 --> 02:25.937
it's always something in the way of that.

02:27.689 --> 02:32.694
[Jill] She's gotten a little bit depressed
around the ups and downs because--

02:32.777 --> 02:33.987
Life is holding her back.

02:34.070 --> 02:37.407
And I don't want this to be it for her.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.910
I feel like Rahanna does not
know her worth.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.539
[Tan] "She's been in a relationship
with her boyfriend for ten years.

02:44.622 --> 02:47.167
His name is Josh.
They've been together since high school...

02:47.250 --> 02:48.918
-Wow!
-...they've just moved in together,

02:49.002 --> 02:51.004
but there's no proposal in sight."

02:51.087 --> 02:52.046
Oh, wow.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.214
Ten years!

02:53.882 --> 02:57.135
"She is 6'3".

02:57.218 --> 02:58.928
-Gorgeous.
-[Karamo] Beautiful.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.723
[Jill] She tells everybody,
if she could give her height away,

03:01.806 --> 03:02.724
-she would.
-She would.

03:02.807 --> 03:05.727
[Tan] "She hates drawing attention
to herself and prefers flats to heels,

03:05.810 --> 03:07.103
and leggings to pants."

03:07.520 --> 03:10.607
I've actually been teased my entire life
for being tall.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.401
Like, when I go out,
I hear little murmurs from people.

03:13.484 --> 03:15.195
It is kind of uncomfortable.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.489
[Tan] "Rahanna usually wears
a natural hairstyle, but at work,

03:18.573 --> 03:21.117
the dog fur and dander
often land in her hair,

03:21.201 --> 03:24.370
-leading her to wash it away too often."
-[Jonathan] She's got a small business

03:24.454 --> 03:26.414
that she's trying to run,
and she's an entrepreneur.

03:27.373 --> 03:30.335
This week, Rahanna needs a plan
for her business and her life.

03:30.418 --> 03:33.004
She needs the Fab Five's help
figuring out how.

03:33.087 --> 03:36.341
Let's help this boss get her bark back.

03:36.424 --> 03:38.384
[howling]

03:38.468 --> 03:40.470
[theme music playing]

03:40.553 --> 03:44.849
-<i>♪ Better ♪</i>
<i>-♪ All things just keep getting better ♪</i>

03:52.357 --> 03:54.901
Oh, my gosh, is that the RV?

03:54.984 --> 03:58.029
-Oh, she's oddly sticking out.
-[Bobby] Oh.

03:58.112 --> 04:00.323
Close your mouth. Good boy.

04:00.698 --> 04:02.659
That is rundown.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.495
[Antoni] All right, let's do this, boys.
Whoo!

04:05.995 --> 04:07.664
[Jonathan] Do you have time for a walk-in?

04:08.414 --> 04:09.958
Oh, my God! Hi!

04:10.041 --> 04:11.668
Oh, my gosh. Hi.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.378
-Hi!
-Hi, puppers!

04:13.461 --> 04:15.046
Hi, beautiful.

04:15.129 --> 04:18.466
This is like a health and safety issue.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.468
[Bobby] Oh. All right.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.095
-Hi!
-Hi!

04:22.470 --> 04:25.056
-Nice to meet you.
-[Rahanna laughs] Hi!

04:25.139 --> 04:26.683
You guys are so fabulous.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.184
-[Karamo] Whose dog is this?
-[Rahanna] This is my dog.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.520
-[Karamo] Can I keep him?
-[Jonathan] I love his rose gold ears.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.981
-I just wanna say, you do God's work.
-[Rahanna] Well, thank you.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.190
Yes!

04:34.649 --> 04:37.819
A little bathtub, but no water.

04:37.902 --> 04:40.905
Unsafe lighting, hanging over her bathtub.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.782
-[Karamo] It's hot in here.
-Too hot.

04:42.865 --> 04:45.285
Rahanna must have
some very faithful clients.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.787
[Jonathan]
This poor trailer has been through it.

04:47.870 --> 04:51.582
She's what some would call "not working."

04:52.208 --> 04:54.836
-It got some issues, so--
-[Bobby] What are your issues?

04:54.919 --> 04:56.921
-Tires, brakes and motor.
-[Tan] Does it drive?

04:57.005 --> 04:58.798
[Bobby] All the things that it needs
to move.

04:58.881 --> 05:00.633
Right, yes. [laughs]

05:00.717 --> 05:02.010
-I'm gonna step out.
-Okay.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.095
-[exhales]
-Grooming bees, too?

05:04.178 --> 05:07.432
So, that hat is when I'm doing, like,
a really big, hairy dog,

05:07.515 --> 05:10.643
and I just got my hair done,
I'm trying to save it a little bit.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.145
-I'll put that on, and--
-I get that.

05:12.228 --> 05:13.479
-Yeah!
-[Karamo] Let's not even pretend.

05:13.563 --> 05:16.649
-God know you all sweating.
-Do you do people? I could use, like...

05:16.733 --> 05:18.943
I could use a little...
I could do, like, a little,

05:19.027 --> 05:20.528
-like a little piece.
-[Rahanna] Yeah!

05:20.611 --> 05:22.613
-People are not my-- [laughs]
-[Jonathan] No? Okay.

05:23.948 --> 05:25.825
-How long has it been here?
-[Rahanna] Two years.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.827
-It's been dead for two years?
-Yeah.

05:27.910 --> 05:30.496
[Bobby] Before she died,
how successful was the business?

05:30.580 --> 05:32.957
I was booked out for weeks in advance.
It was going really well.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.250
Perhaps over two years,

05:34.334 --> 05:36.377
-you've just been watching your business--
-Yeah.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.713
I felt like giving up,

05:38.796 --> 05:41.549
so I felt like the business kind of
just went along with it.

05:41.632 --> 05:42.633
-I get that.
-Yeah.

05:42.717 --> 05:47.138
So, basically, the only thing that's
really thrown a wrench in your success

05:47.221 --> 05:48.639
-is her.
-Yeah.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.476
This RV clearly helped Rahanna
in many ways.

05:51.559 --> 05:54.354
It helped her get her
mobile grooming business off the ground,

05:54.437 --> 05:57.732
but sometimes in business,
you've got to realize,

05:58.191 --> 06:00.526
it's time to move on
and try something new.

06:00.610 --> 06:03.279
I'm a small business owner.
I made decisions

06:03.363 --> 06:05.073
that I thought were the best
at the moment,

06:05.156 --> 06:07.158
and then ended up costing me more money.

06:07.241 --> 06:08.743
-Yeah.
-So I get it. I get it.

06:08.826 --> 06:11.788
The only drive I'm seeing a lack of

06:11.871 --> 06:14.582
-is the ability to drive this.
-Yes! [laughs]

06:14.665 --> 06:17.043
-Right. Yeah.
-You seem to have plenty of drive.

06:19.420 --> 06:22.256
Oh, Queen, look at you in all your glory.

06:22.340 --> 06:26.844
Did it hurt when you fell from heaven,
girl? Wow! You are gorgeous.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.721
[laughing]

06:28.846 --> 06:31.682
-[Tan] Your mom and dad live close by?
-Yes, they live right here.

06:32.392 --> 06:36.521
Your parents love you. If my sons tried
to move an RV in front of my house,

06:36.604 --> 06:38.022
this would've been gone already.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.108
[Tan]
You're using your parents' electricity?

06:40.191 --> 06:42.193
-[Rahanna] Yes.
-[Karamo] You know that's 'hood as hell.

06:42.276 --> 06:43.778
[Jonathan] Oh, is this Mom?

06:43.861 --> 06:46.864
-[chattering]
-[laughing]

06:46.948 --> 06:49.826
What do you think of her stealing
your electricity, for goodness' sake?

06:49.909 --> 06:50.785
[laughing]

06:50.868 --> 06:52.412
Anything to help her out.

06:52.912 --> 06:55.415
You know, this is not the end-all, be-all,

06:55.498 --> 06:58.501
for it to sit right here.
She's gonna get it mobile and running.

06:59.627 --> 07:01.254
She's a hard worker.

07:01.379 --> 07:05.174
She has been at this grooming thing
for seven years,

07:05.258 --> 07:09.345
but when she does get it off the ground,
it seems like things start just happening.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.806
What have you been able to accomplish
in the past three and a half years

07:11.889 --> 07:15.101
-that you're really proud of?
-I pretty much just do what I can.

07:15.893 --> 07:18.229
I'm grateful for the fact that
I still can work in it.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.356
I still have some clients who are loyal,
who come--

07:20.440 --> 07:22.275
-[Antoni] They bring their dogs here?
-Yeah, they do.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.444
[Antoni] You must be good,
if they're coming out here.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.821
-[Tan] How long you had the business?
-Three and a half years.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.240
That's nothing. The first five years
are always a [bleeps] show.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.535
-Always a [bleeps] show.
-It does feel like a [bleeps] show.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.619
[laughing]

07:33.703 --> 07:35.538
But the fact that you're still in it,
that's amazing.

07:35.621 --> 07:36.873
-Come on, my love. Come with me.
-Okay.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.624
[Tan] When I was a business owner,

07:38.708 --> 07:40.960
I was struggling through
my first few years of business.

07:41.043 --> 07:43.880
You get to the point where
you can't see the wood for the trees,

07:43.963 --> 07:45.298
you don't know how to get out.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.675
I'm seeing what needs to change,
we get that.

07:47.758 --> 07:52.305
So, I guess I want to understand,
what was the dream? What<i> is</i> the dream?

07:52.388 --> 07:56.017
I definitely want to have a fleet
of mobile grooming trucks, eventually.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.644
-Love that. Franchise that...
-I do want to have a stationary RV.

07:58.728 --> 07:59.562
-Yeah.
-Yes.

07:59.645 --> 08:02.106
I do eventually want to have dog clothes.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.983
-Yeah.
-I wanna have dog treats, dog food,

08:04.066 --> 08:06.319
and I definitely,
definitely want to do a dog show.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.529
It's been one of my passions, too.

08:08.613 --> 08:11.032
-Is that what this kind of is all about?
-[Rahanna] A little!

08:11.115 --> 08:14.076
-Okay. Okay, great.
-I want to be able to show my work.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.370
All the colors and unique styles
that I do on dogs.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.748
-Then, let's get you on the way to that.
-Okay.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.042
[Tan] If you can bathe me in here
real quick. It's big enough for me.

08:21.125 --> 08:21.959
[Rahanna laughs]

08:22.043 --> 08:24.504
All right, now it's time
to come and see your house.

08:24.587 --> 08:25.922
Yeah, let's go.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.089
-Queen.
-See you.

08:27.173 --> 08:30.301
-Bye. We'll see you soon.
-Promise we'll take the best care of her.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.595
-Bye-bye!
-[Rahanna laughs]

08:34.305 --> 08:37.141
-Very cute apartment complex.
-[Rahanna] Yes.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.976
-[Tan] How long have you lived here?
-[Rahanna] A month.

08:39.060 --> 08:39.894
[Tan] Okay.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.270
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.605
[Bobby] Girl, yes.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.023
[knock on door]

08:45.525 --> 08:46.359
Hey!

08:46.442 --> 08:48.819
Oh!

08:48.903 --> 08:49.987
-What's your name?
-I'm Josh.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.822
-Hey, Josh.
-Hey, how are you?

08:51.906 --> 08:53.533
-Hey. Nice to meet you.
-Hey, Josh.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.451
Karamo. Nice to meet you.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.828
-Show us around.
-Let's divide and conquer.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.997
-All right, so--
-[Tan] Divide and conquer what?

09:00.414 --> 09:03.084
-[Antoni] Working with a blank slate.
-[Rahanna] Yes!

09:03.167 --> 09:06.337
All right, so sofa, TV, living room.

09:06.879 --> 09:10.132
Popcorn maker.
No shame in that, you're allowed.

09:12.468 --> 09:15.930

I nailed it.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.560
All right. Camping.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.147
-Hmm.
-There's a lot of tubs in here.

09:26.190 --> 09:28.985
This literally feels like the house
of a 22-year-old.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.404
[Bobby] Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.

09:31.487 --> 09:33.823
-[Karamo] What's going on in here?
-[Bobby] Y'all...

09:33.906 --> 09:36.993
How are you supposed to make
sensual love on an air mattress?

09:37.493 --> 09:39.870
How many air mattresses have we
been through, y'all,

09:39.954 --> 09:40.913
just popping them?

09:40.997 --> 09:45.209
[clears throat] They're, like,
$600 sneakers. You can afford a mattress.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.296
-[laughing]
-[Karamo] I have found my glory, ladies.

09:48.379 --> 09:49.338
[cheering]

09:50.214 --> 09:53.593
Yes, yes, yes!

09:53.676 --> 09:56.762
I'm a bald man. Something happens to me
when a wig comes on.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.472
Make it jiggle, make it bounce.
Make it jiggle...

09:58.556 --> 10:01.100
I feel like me again. I feel whole.

10:01.183 --> 10:03.561
-I am ready for the strip club!
-Yeah!

10:03.644 --> 10:06.105
-Stop it, you're confusing Josh.
-Sorry!

10:06.188 --> 10:09.400

Turn away! Get out! Get out! Get out!

10:09.483 --> 10:11.694
[Karamo] This is my life. I'm living.

10:11.777 --> 10:15.489
-This is it?
-No, I have more clothes in the bins.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.785
I work all the time, so I'm usually in,
like, tights,

10:19.869 --> 10:22.204
-and biker shorts, and T-shirts.
-Where do you shop?

10:22.288 --> 10:23.998
I do a lot of my shopping online.

10:24.081 --> 10:27.001
I do a website called Long Tall Sally,

10:27.084 --> 10:29.629
they also have long jeans
and stuff like that.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.213
-Big shoes.
-[Tan] Okay.

10:31.297 --> 10:34.675
So sorry.
Jonathan said to put the wig back.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.344
-I want the wig so bad.
-I'm so sorry.

10:47.229 --> 10:50.232
[Antoni] Oh, my! It's... oh, it's tea.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.321
[Karamo] Can we spend some time outside
and chat?

10:55.404 --> 10:56.697
-Yes.
-Come on.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.908
-[Tan] Do you only go for flats?
-[Rahanna] I do, most of the time.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.911
I do have some heels,
but I don't really wear them at all.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.412
-I'm already tall.
-Can I see them?

11:03.496 --> 11:05.456
They're in the closet.
I actually made these.

11:05.539 --> 11:08.125
[Tan] Oh, you shaved off some dog hair
and put it in a shoe!

11:08.292 --> 11:11.087
Real cute. So, you will wear them
every now and then?

11:11.170 --> 11:12.797
-Very rarely.
-I look at you, thinking,

11:12.880 --> 11:15.341
"What's she afraid of? She looks hot."

11:15.424 --> 11:18.302
-Thank you. [laughs]
-So, I'm gonna just highlight that.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.970
[Karamo] Ten years has been a long time.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.057
Have you seen her change
and the business change?

11:23.140 --> 11:25.976
She's always been that go-getter type
of woman.

11:26.060 --> 11:30.022
However, because of the business
not going the way she wanted it to go

11:30.106 --> 11:32.858
and because of me hurting her,
it just seemed like

11:33.317 --> 11:37.071
it was just a big hole that
she couldn't really get out of.

11:37.154 --> 11:41.117
-What does that mean?
-I betrayed her, with her trust.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.078
I'm very surprised by Josh.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.247
I wasn't expecting any of this.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.499
How has that affected your relationship?

11:49.208 --> 11:50.084
A lot.

11:50.167 --> 11:53.546
Like, she felt like there was no hope,

11:53.629 --> 11:55.381
like everything was coming down on her.

11:55.464 --> 11:59.760
You know, I finally decided, like,
this is not the person that I want to be.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.596
We're doing a lot more,
trying to keep ourselves active.

12:02.680 --> 12:06.642
Hanging out with friends, but you know,
I know that she's hurting still from it.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.645
And then, on top of that,
you're moving into a place together,

12:09.729 --> 12:13.023
so you're not fully healed from that,
but you've decided to take the next step.

12:13.107 --> 12:13.941
Yeah.

12:14.024 --> 12:18.028
I just want to show her
and show others in her corner

12:18.112 --> 12:22.158
that she didn't make a bad decision
on the man that she chose.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.911
[Jonathan]
Let me see your little naily-nailies.

12:25.995 --> 12:29.331
Girl, pretty. Maybe we could just
treat you to a little bit of pampering.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.376
-Okay. [laughs]
-Okay, love. Let's do it.

12:32.460 --> 12:35.087
[Tan] I guess we should get this week
started. Are we all ready for this?

12:35.171 --> 12:37.715
-Okay.
-I gotta say goodbye to the location

12:37.798 --> 12:40.217

gold medal Olympic,

12:40.301 --> 12:41.844

-Yes, we do.

I really hope that Rahanna can see,

13:01.906 --> 13:05.743
every failure you have is just another
lesson that helps you become

13:05.826 --> 13:07.495
an even bigger success.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.502
Rahanna has a lot of hopes and dreams
for Stylish Pooch,

13:14.585 --> 13:16.921
and I want to show her,
if you have an idea

13:17.213 --> 13:20.591
you can turn it into an action.
You just have to take the first step.

13:22.593 --> 13:26.847
[Tan] Rahanna chooses to wear
purely workout clothes every day,

13:26.931 --> 13:28.891
to avoid being seen.

13:29.391 --> 13:32.978
I don't want her to ever feel like
she has to dim her shine for anyone.

13:33.979 --> 13:37.107
[Jonathan] Rahanna is the caretaker,
and I love that about her,

13:37.191 --> 13:40.861
but it's really time to help Rahanna
see her potential and learn her worth

13:41.237 --> 13:44.573
so that she can empower herself
to make better decisions moving forward.

13:45.866 --> 13:47.409
[Karamo] Because of what happened
in the relationship,

13:47.493 --> 13:49.203
she doesn't know how to get out
of this rut,

13:49.286 --> 13:51.789
so I'm gonna help her to figure out how
to heal herself,

13:51.872 --> 13:55.417

as she moves forward as an entrepreneur.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.366
[Bobby] A doggy fashion show.

14:28.492 --> 14:29.702
That's a good idea.

14:29.785 --> 14:32.079
Rahanna's always wanted
to do a doggy fashion show,

14:32.371 --> 14:35.165
but she's never been able to put it
together. She's never had the funds.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.334
So I want to take this opportunity

14:37.418 --> 14:39.336
to put together a doggy fashion show
for her.

14:39.420 --> 14:42.715
I think this would be a beautiful way
to market your business

14:42.798 --> 14:45.801
because it brings in new customers,
it gets your brand out there.

14:45.885 --> 14:49.305
So, we're gonna close off the street,
and we're gonna have a big old runway,

-First of all, I love a fashion show,
-[laughs]

14:55.978 --> 15:00.441
but for me, it's more important
that you start to pivot your business.

15:00.524 --> 15:03.569
Bobby and I both are business people.
We know how difficult it is.

15:03.652 --> 15:04.778

but I don't have, like, boss.

You've proven that your concept
is a success.

15:12.953 --> 15:16.624
-Yeah.
-You just had an RV, who she...

15:16.749 --> 15:18.584

Bobby's hit hard times in business.
I've hit really, really hard times

15:22.254 --> 15:24.757
where I couldn't afford a coffee
three years into my business.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.217
You just have to find another way
to pivot.

15:27.301 --> 15:30.220
Think, "Okay, that didn't work.
What else have I got in my arsenal?"

15:30.304 --> 15:33.307
I never thought I would end up
making women's wear.

15:33.390 --> 15:36.393
I started out with menswear.
It didn't matter. I had a dream

15:36.477 --> 15:39.355
and it was way bigger
than the one thing I was doing.

15:39.438 --> 15:40.689
You want to be grooming. Wonderful.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.191

there's only one way to do it.

-Yeah.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.182
Do you feel like your needs
in the relationship have shifted

19:02.266 --> 19:04.685
from when you were 17
to where you're 27 now?

19:04.768 --> 19:09.314
Definitely grew together, and I do still
feel like there's room for growth.

19:10.107 --> 19:13.235
We've been through a whole lot
in the past, but I think he's trying.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.863
I think it's like constantly having
that conversation

19:15.946 --> 19:18.657
and being able to be like,
"Hey, let's check in."

19:18.740 --> 19:21.618
-Right.
-Josh has his needs, you have yours.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.413
-Yeah.
-Sometimes it can be awkward as hell,

19:24.496 --> 19:26.039
but you never know
until you have that talk.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.040
Exactly.

19:28.083 --> 19:32.546
-[Antoni] Bake it at 350 for 15 minutes.
-Okay. Can I dance now?

19:33.839 --> 19:34.715
[laughs]

19:36.425 --> 19:40.053
Excellent.
So with a little bit of the egg wash,

19:40.137 --> 19:42.764
you can lightly brush over the surface
like this.

19:43.140 --> 19:47.060
Now we're gonna coat these
sesame seeds just like this.

19:48.061 --> 19:49.855
-And they kind of cling to it nicely.
-Look at that.

19:49.938 --> 19:52.441
[Antoni] And then we're ready
for the final phase, tasting.

19:53.775 --> 19:56.028
[crunching]

19:56.111 --> 19:56.945
Good.

19:57.988 --> 20:00.449
-Such a satisfying crunch.
-Yeah. [laughs]

20:00.532 --> 20:02.034
-Bennie is gonna love it.
-Swag.

20:02.534 --> 20:05.245
-[laughing]
-A different definition, but still swag.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.540
[dance music playing]

20:15.714 --> 20:17.925
[Tan] Okay, my love, come on through.

20:18.008 --> 20:20.135
-You look real nervous.
-I am.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.429
-Why? It's just me.
-I don't know. [laughs]

20:22.512 --> 20:24.139
The reason why I wanted to bring you here

20:24.223 --> 20:27.226
is because they have a tall section
at Old Navy,

20:27.309 --> 20:29.394
-so everything is appropriate for you.
-Okay.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.521
When you come shopping,

20:31.605 --> 20:33.941
-what is it you're looking for?
-Mostly jeans.

20:34.191 --> 20:37.110
That's always, like, my number one
'cause I'm always wearing jeans.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.403
You don't wear jeans to work.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.864
Sometimes I feel it gets
a little messy at work.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.824
-Okay.
-My jeans are my going out...

20:42.908 --> 20:45.244
But I do think I should step it up some.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.995
-Let me show you over here something.
-Okay.

20:47.287 --> 20:49.790
[Tan] Old Navy has durable denim.

20:49.873 --> 20:54.086
You can wear this to death,
and it's not going to get damaged easily.

20:54.378 --> 20:58.006
Most people don't work in an environment
where jeans are most appropriate for work.

20:58.090 --> 21:01.343
-However, it would be a step up...
-Okay.

21:01.426 --> 21:04.263
-...from cycling shorts.
-[laughs] Okay!

21:04.596 --> 21:06.890
-[Tan] You're particular about the length.
-Yes.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.642
The length is always an issue.

21:08.725 --> 21:11.561
I get that. It's actually really difficult
to shop for my height also.

21:11.645 --> 21:14.064
-Okay.
-Do you embrace your height?

21:14.147 --> 21:17.567
Yes and no. Like, me and my sister,
or, like, a friend of mine,

21:17.651 --> 21:20.529
if we're getting ready to go out,
I'm super excited, I feel good.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.531
-Good.
-The minute I get there, I, like,

21:22.614 --> 21:25.200
shut down and feel like
I don't want to be here.

21:25.575 --> 21:26.410
Tell me why.

21:27.035 --> 21:29.538
-Because of the whole, like--
-You're worried that people stare?

21:30.163 --> 21:30.998
Yeah.

21:32.874 --> 21:36.461
My friends, they're super petite,
and they'll get all the attention,

21:36.545 --> 21:39.423
[sobs] and I'm just, like, off in a corner.

21:41.758 --> 21:42.592
[Tan] Come here.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.806
I get it.
Of course that's gonna be hard.

21:47.889 --> 21:52.811
But you've got something so special.
I can say it till I'm blue in the face,

21:52.894 --> 21:56.690
and you won't believe it until
<i>you</i> believe it. You are gorg, Rahanna.

21:56.773 --> 21:57.733
[Rahanna] Thank you.

21:57.899 --> 22:00.444
-Me saying that isn't gonna correct this.
-Mm-hmm.

22:00.527 --> 22:03.947
It is a lifetime
of seeing yourself negatively,

22:04.031 --> 22:06.366
-and that's not gonna change overnight.
-Yeah.

22:06.450 --> 22:10.787
Maybe part of it is
seeing your proportions the way I see it.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.622
Let's play with that
and see if that works.

22:12.706 --> 22:13.540
Okay.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.294
[Tan]
When you go shopping, do you go alone?

22:17.377 --> 22:20.547
No, if I do go shopping,
which is very rare...

22:20.630 --> 22:23.508
-Yeah. Okay.
-...it's with my mom or my sister.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.469
-My mom is like my hype man.
-Good.

22:25.552 --> 22:27.429
So, if you want to step in here for me.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.558
-Hey, Mom! [laughing]
-Hey!

22:32.517 --> 22:34.978
-Hey!
-[laughing]

22:35.103 --> 22:37.606
-Come out! Come out! Come out!
-[Rahanna] Oh, man.

22:37.689 --> 22:40.442
Who better to help me shop
than her mom?

22:40.525 --> 22:43.653
-Look how good Mom looks.
-She does. She looks really good.

22:43.737 --> 22:46.740
I want to get to the point
where we can encourage Rahanna

22:46.823 --> 22:49.159
to see her height as a positive.

22:49.242 --> 22:53.914
I want her to be here to remind Rahanna
she's beautiful just the way she is.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.167
-[Rahanna laughs]
-[Tan] I just want to see how low it goes.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.877
I love a bit of cleave.

22:59.669 --> 23:03.215
It's not a pencil. What it does is,
if you let it flare slightly,

23:03.298 --> 23:05.926
you can see how beautifully shaped
your legs are.

23:06.009 --> 23:07.803
Focus on your legs for a second.

23:07.886 --> 23:10.305
-Do you see that? Like, nothing there.
-[Rahanna] Yeah.

23:10.764 --> 23:13.475
-[Tan] Sexy as fu--
-[laughing]

23:13.600 --> 23:15.519
How do you feel about your height in this?

23:15.602 --> 23:17.813
-I would totally wear this.
-Okay, good.

23:18.313 --> 23:19.648
[Rahanna]
These heels are comfortable, too.

23:19.731 --> 23:22.567
-[Jill] And they nice.
-I know you don't need it for the height,

23:22.651 --> 23:25.278
but I think it's gonna make you stand
in a different way.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.447
Wear them often. Like, show people

23:27.531 --> 23:29.324
-you don't give a...
-Okay!

23:29.408 --> 23:31.451
-Are you seeing me, Mother?
-I see you, daughter.

23:31.535 --> 23:32.494
-Can you see me?
-[Jill] Okay.

23:32.577 --> 23:37.332
Watching Rahanna in a pair of heels
walk so confidently

23:37.416 --> 23:39.793
makes me feel like we're starting
to evolve.

23:39.876 --> 23:43.839
We're starting to realize that maybe
our height is something to be embraced.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.635
-Your jeans. Comfortable, right?
-[Rahanna] Mm-hmm.

23:48.718 --> 23:51.596
I like that. She always has an issue
with her length.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.807
[Tan] Why couldn't you work in that?

23:53.890 --> 23:56.184
-You can still groom the dogs.
-I could.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.979
You said your goal and your dream was
to become a franchise.

23:59.062 --> 24:01.189
-You want to run an empire.
-Yeah.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.692
I wouldn't take
cycling-short lady seriously,

24:03.775 --> 24:05.610
but I'd take this lady seriously.

24:05.694 --> 24:08.572
-Okay!
-[Tan] When it gets colder in the morning,

24:08.655 --> 24:12.117
-you're on your way to work--
-This blazer is, like, everything.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.536
-I love the blazer on you.
-[Jill] I like that whole look.

24:14.619 --> 24:16.079
Yeah, and it's so long.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.747
-Ready to get changed? Thank you.
-Yes.

24:18.123 --> 24:18.957
Great.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.459
-Did we nail it?
-You nailed it.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.962
[rock music playing]

24:27.883 --> 24:30.510
[Karamo] This is why I could never be
a waiter. I'm walking, like...

24:30.594 --> 24:32.429
-[Rahanna] Yeah, right?
-...like this better not drop.

24:32.512 --> 24:35.015
Black folks having afternoon tea.
How cool.

24:35.182 --> 24:37.184
I feel royal and regal right now.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.768
Or we can do a bit of <i>Get Out.</i>

24:39.311 --> 24:41.980
Somebody's about to go
into the sunken place, quickly.

24:42.522 --> 24:44.065
I don't know who it's about to be,

24:44.149 --> 24:45.817
but I have a feeling
it's about to be Josh.

24:45.901 --> 24:46.860
Sorry, girl.

24:47.861 --> 24:50.113
-You two have decided to move in together.
-Yeah.

24:50.697 --> 24:51.865
Why did you make this choice?

24:51.948 --> 24:55.410
We've been together for so long,
and we haven't lived together.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.705
I feel like it's a step up, like,
moving forward and trusting each other.

24:58.788 --> 25:02.417
-Like, we're together all the time.
-Spending time together is not talking.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.044
Just because you sit next to somebody,

25:04.127 --> 25:06.671
there's a million things in your heads,
is that what's happening?

25:06.755 --> 25:08.089
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.550
This is a young couple that's had their
ups and downs.

25:10.759 --> 25:14.137
I have to help Rahanna get past
the doubts she's having in herself,

25:14.387 --> 25:16.014
so that she can feel confident

25:16.097 --> 25:19.017
as she moves forward in her relationship
and her business.

25:19.351 --> 25:23.605
After you told me that you had cheated,

25:24.314 --> 25:26.274
it started to connect the dots.

25:26.358 --> 25:30.487
That lack of trust here is playing
into your ability at work.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.366
When I saw your RV,

25:34.991 --> 25:37.702
I saw a woman
who life started to bury her,

25:38.119 --> 25:41.206
and she started to not trust
that she could dig herself out of it.

25:43.291 --> 25:45.085
Part of that is coming from this.

25:56.930 --> 25:59.599
I just want... the best for her, like...

26:01.601 --> 26:03.603
I messed everything up, so...

26:04.521 --> 26:07.816
it plays a part in,
not just the relationship,

26:07.899 --> 26:09.442
but her business.

26:09.526 --> 26:12.487
Like, this is where
she's making her money at.

26:13.029 --> 26:16.283
I just want to get back to before that,

26:16.825 --> 26:17.784
when we was happy.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.749
[Karamo] Part of not being able
to move forward is because

26:24.833 --> 26:28.003
you have to be able to communicate
about it honestly and openly

26:28.295 --> 26:29.588
and consistently.

26:31.881 --> 26:36.303
[Josh] I know what I did in the past,
and I don't like to see her upset.

26:36.720 --> 26:41.308
So, when I feel like we're at a state
where we're good...

26:41.391 --> 26:43.518
-Yeah.
-...I don't wanna bring it back up.

26:45.186 --> 26:47.564
I kind of want to leave that old me...

26:48.315 --> 26:49.316
in the past.

26:49.399 --> 26:52.861
But your past actions
are still affecting your present.

26:54.821 --> 26:58.658
Sometimes I think that we're not gonna
be able to move forward from it.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.827
Yeah, how often do those questions pop
into your head?

27:00.910 --> 27:02.746
-Very often. Very often.
-Yeah.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.372
[Rahanna] And it's hard.

27:04.831 --> 27:05.915
I just want...

27:07.375 --> 27:09.127
to be able to trust you again.

27:09.794 --> 27:13.006
It's not fair for you all to have
these things that are looming,

27:13.089 --> 27:18.511
that are causing you all to not have
the ability to grow individually

27:18.595 --> 27:19.846
and then also grow together.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.642
So, what question do you have
with him about this?

27:25.435 --> 27:26.853
Will you cheat on me again?

27:28.605 --> 27:29.439
No.

27:30.940 --> 27:31.941
My feelings...

27:32.901 --> 27:36.571
are way too valuable to keep going through
this situation.

27:36.655 --> 27:40.158
Yeah. Do you believe
that if it becomes too much,

27:40.241 --> 27:42.535
-that you can leave him?
-Yes.

27:42.952 --> 27:46.247
Do you believe that if you do it again,
that she'll leave you?

27:47.040 --> 27:50.377
-Yeah.
-If it isn't gonna work, then I'm out.

27:50.460 --> 27:51.711
-[Karamo] Yeah.
-[Rahanna] I'm done.

27:52.170 --> 27:55.215
You gotta let this go,
if it's not going to make you happy.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.093
But if you both are willing to try,

27:58.176 --> 28:01.513
gotta both be clear
about what you need in clear action.

28:01.596 --> 28:04.349
Otherwise, he's gonna be thinking,
"I'm already doing it."

28:04.432 --> 28:06.518
And you're gonna be thinking,
"You ain't doing it yet."

28:06.976 --> 28:09.646
That will be the first step,
building a relationship

28:09.729 --> 28:12.232
where you two are communicating properly.

28:12.607 --> 28:13.817
-Does that work?
-Yeah.

28:13.900 --> 28:16.569
-Sounds good.
-That make me fall in love.

28:16.653 --> 28:17.904
[laughing]

28:20.115 --> 28:22.659
<i>♪ I'm just focused on me ♪</i>

28:22.742 --> 28:27.539
<i>♪ I'm just focused on me</i>
<i>My jam to the jump of my beat ♪</i>

28:27.622 --> 28:29.332
<i>♪ I got it, I got it  ♪</i>

28:29.416 --> 28:31.793
[Jonathan] Come with me,
I'm gonna take you to my little baby lair.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.545
-Okay.
-Ugh. Can I take your hair down?

28:33.628 --> 28:34.504
-Of course.
-Okay.

28:34.587 --> 28:37.882
So, my thought for the fashion show--

28:37.966 --> 28:40.552
-Have you ever had a snatched braid?
-No.

28:40.635 --> 28:45.265
Whatever look you're trying to complement,
braids really go with them.

28:45.348 --> 28:47.434
They are versatile. They last for weeks.

28:47.517 --> 28:49.102
I do want to make you feel gorgeous,

28:49.185 --> 28:51.938
but at the same time,
you are taking care of dogs.

28:52.021 --> 28:53.690
-That's part of my thinking in this, too.
-Right.

28:53.773 --> 28:56.568
She doesn't have time to be dealing
with her hair every single morning.

28:56.651 --> 28:58.278
She's got dogs' hair to do, honey.

28:58.361 --> 29:00.655
When I do hair, like, if you notice,
my hair is back.

29:00.739 --> 29:05.118
I don't really do hair with my hair down,
'cause I just don't like hair in my face.

29:05.201 --> 29:07.954
-We can do braids. Okay.
-I think that'd be kind of snatch.

29:08.329 --> 29:10.498
-Let's put it right back.
-You look really cute, by the way.

29:10.582 --> 29:13.334
-<i>You</i> look really cute, by the way.
-You think so?

29:13.418 --> 29:15.670
-Yes! Come with me, I'll wash your hair.
-[laughs]

29:15.754 --> 29:18.715
[Jonathan] Yes? So rinse, so clean. Okay.

29:19.507 --> 29:22.051
When it comes to braids that last,
that is not my strong suit,

29:22.135 --> 29:24.053
so that's where Kadie comes in.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.807
-Do you want a little red wine?
-Yes.

29:32.103 --> 29:33.104
-Thank you.
-[whirring]

29:34.689 --> 29:36.357
[Kadiesha] Do you wear braids a lot?

29:36.441 --> 29:40.904
I wear braids, but I usually get, like,
box braids or goddess braids.

29:40.987 --> 29:43.740
-I like my braids super long.
-How long? Do you think past your butt?

29:43.823 --> 29:45.200
-[Rahanna] To my butt is good.
-[Kadiesha] Okay.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.951
-'Cause we don't want it to wear her.
-[Rahanna laughs] Yeah.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.537
[Kadiesha] Yes...

29:50.538 --> 29:53.583
-Yes.
-[Rahanna] Ooh, and it doesn't hurt!

29:54.250 --> 29:55.502
[Jonathan] Who's your favorite client?

29:55.585 --> 29:57.295
-Are they gonna be here tomorrow?
-Yes.

29:57.378 --> 29:59.756
They are? Have you been grooming them
for a long time?

29:59.839 --> 30:02.592
-Yeah, about two years.
-How long have you been doing it?

30:02.675 --> 30:04.135
[Rahanna] Nine years.

30:04.219 --> 30:07.138
What do you want to take from your
experiences so far into your future?

30:07.222 --> 30:10.517
I definitely feel like being patient.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.645
Especially with the ups and downs
of being a business owner.

30:13.728 --> 30:16.064
I also lowball myself a lot
in my business.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.273
-Oh!
-[Rahanna] Yes.

30:17.357 --> 30:20.527
When I was doing hair, every year,
every price went up five bucks.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.570
My clients were never surprised
about that.

30:23.029 --> 30:24.864
Knowing our worth
and sticking to our worth

30:24.948 --> 30:27.450
and charging our worth,
is so important in the service industry

30:27.534 --> 30:29.118
because when you're your own
business owner,

30:29.202 --> 30:32.831
you have to advocate for yourself
'cause no one else is gonna do it.

30:32.914 --> 30:36.125
And you deserve to make your money,

30:36.209 --> 30:37.919
you deserve to maintain your clients,

30:38.002 --> 30:39.462
and you deserve
to charge what you're worth.

30:41.548 --> 30:43.675
Cheers. Love.

30:45.927 --> 30:48.972
Yes, use that hairspray. Whoa!

30:49.389 --> 30:51.099
Slay her down!

30:51.182 --> 30:53.768
Hashtag, like, BlackGirlMagic. Very much.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.770
-Can't handle, so gorg.
-[laughs]

30:56.938 --> 30:58.731
[Jonathan]
Oh, my God, let's take this off of her.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.441
The new Rahanna.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.110
-Honey, she came to slay.
-[Rahanna] You see me?

31:02.193 --> 31:03.611
-Ready to come see you?
-Yes.

31:04.153 --> 31:05.697
-[Jonathan] Okay, ready?
-Yes.

31:05.780 --> 31:08.408
New Rahanna, she's stunning,
and she's ready for you to see her

31:08.491 --> 31:10.410
in three, two, one.

31:11.119 --> 31:13.580
Oh, my gosh, it looks so pretty.

31:14.289 --> 31:17.458
-Yes! [laughs]
-Right?

31:17.542 --> 31:20.670
-See these details?
-I do, they are amazing.

31:21.588 --> 31:22.422
I love it.

31:23.047 --> 31:25.884
Thank you for blessing us with your
gorgeous fingers and your time, Kadie.

31:25.967 --> 31:27.802
-You really slayed it.
-Thank you for having me.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.512
-Do you love your hair?
-Yes.

31:29.596 --> 31:30.680
So beautiful.

31:31.222 --> 31:32.348
Let's go slay the day.

31:32.807 --> 31:35.518
<i>♪ So I look up at the sun ♪</i>

31:35.643 --> 31:37.979

31:38.062 --> 31:39.981

31:40.064 --> 31:42.650

31:45.904 --> 31:48.489
-Are you nervy but excited?
-Yes, I can't wait.

31:48.823 --> 31:49.908
I'm so excited to see.

31:50.241 --> 31:51.910
We're here!

31:51.993 --> 31:54.412
Oh, my God!

31:54.537 --> 31:55.997
-[Rahanna] Hi!
-[Bobby] Hi!

31:57.081 --> 31:58.249
-Hey!
-Hello!

31:58.333 --> 32:00.835
-Oh, hi, my love. It's good to see you.
-What is that, 22 inches?

32:00.919 --> 32:03.254
-You see?
-You look so good.

32:03.630 --> 32:04.714
[Tan] Come on in.

32:04.797 --> 32:07.008
-Oh, gosh. It looks so good!
-What do you think?

32:07.467 --> 32:10.178
-[Rahanna] This is my house?
-[Fab 5] Yeah!

32:10.970 --> 32:13.806
[Rahanna]
It looks like a magazine. Oh, my God.

32:14.849 --> 32:19.103
You guys are, like, the best. I love it.
You guys are so awesome.

32:19.187 --> 32:20.146
Oh-ho-ho!

32:20.229 --> 32:21.606
-[Bobby] Ready to see more?
-Yes.

32:22.482 --> 32:24.943
Look at the olive! Oh, my gosh!

32:26.194 --> 32:27.278
[Bobby] A new light.

32:27.362 --> 32:30.073
You love animals, so I tried to put them
everywhere I could.

32:30.156 --> 32:32.408
[Rahanna] So cute!

32:32.492 --> 32:34.327
I cannot believe this is my house.

32:34.410 --> 32:35.995
-I can't.
-Believe it, girl.

32:36.079 --> 32:37.914
-I can't.
-You have to, though.

32:37.997 --> 32:40.500
Oh, my God, look at my room!

32:41.876 --> 32:44.462
[Bobby] Now you've got a nice big bed
that you're not gonna hang off of.

32:44.545 --> 32:45.838
[Rahanna] That is so great.

32:47.340 --> 32:48.675
[Bobby] Oh!

32:48.758 --> 32:50.927
Oh, my God, it's so beautiful!

32:51.052 --> 32:52.178
[Bobby] Mm!

32:53.262 --> 32:56.265
-[Tan] You've even got a seating area.
-[Antoni] And they swivel!

32:56.683 --> 32:59.936
[Bobby] I wanted to make sure that you had
a space where you can come in here,

33:00.019 --> 33:01.729
pop your feet up on the bed,
read a book--

33:01.813 --> 33:04.691
Self-care.
Your space affects your creative mind

33:04.774 --> 33:08.486
and having this space,
it will impact all the areas of your life,

33:08.569 --> 33:10.780
your business, your relationship.
It's fab.

33:10.863 --> 33:14.325
I don't even wanna leave.
I feel bossy bitch up in here. I do.

33:16.703 --> 33:20.039
-Okay, I didn't get you many leggings.
-[laughing]

33:20.164 --> 33:23.001
I wanted to give you options that are
gonna be good for you to work in.

33:23.084 --> 33:26.963
That are durable, that you can actually
feel like, "Okay, I own this place."

33:27.046 --> 33:31.509
-Okay.
-I know you like long, flowy situations,

33:31.592 --> 33:35.430
-so I got you versions--
-Ooh, I love this!

33:35.513 --> 33:37.265
And it's a version
of something you already know,

33:37.348 --> 33:39.350
-Mm-hmm.
-but then team it with something like...

33:39.726 --> 33:41.978
-a great-fitting pair of jeans.
-Right.

33:42.061 --> 33:43.396
-High-waisted.
-Yes.

33:43.479 --> 33:46.482
And it's gonna feel
a lot more young, modern.

33:46.566 --> 33:50.236
I want the boys to see you in the jeans,
'cause your ass is insane,

33:50.319 --> 33:52.530
-and I want them to see your ass in that.
-Oh, this ass?

33:52.613 --> 33:56.242
That one right there.
That beautiful one right there.

33:56.617 --> 33:58.244
Boys, are you ready?

33:58.327 --> 33:59.579
[all] Yeah!

33:59.662 --> 34:00.747
[Tan] Okay, what do you think?

34:02.874 --> 34:05.126
-[Karamo] Oh, girl.
-[Jonathan] Oh, my God, that shoe.

34:05.209 --> 34:07.503
-That shoe. Oh, my God!
-[Rahanna] Hey!

34:07.587 --> 34:12.008
-[Jonathan] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-[Antoni] Yes! Your legs!

34:12.091 --> 34:13.885
[Jonathan] Tan, not that you don't always
do a good job,

34:13.968 --> 34:15.803

-[Karamo] Slay.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.513

34:18.973 --> 34:21.225
-How do you feel?
-I feel good.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.727
-I love the jacket.
-[Antoni] With your hair!

34:22.810 --> 34:24.896
-I can't.
-[Rahanna] Yes!

34:24.979 --> 34:26.689
[Jonathan] How do you feel about
this little baby heel?

34:26.773 --> 34:30.401
-I know we talked about heels--
-It's really comfortable. It really is.

34:30.485 --> 34:33.488
-Model status.
-I think we're ready for the fashion show.

34:33.571 --> 34:34.864
-We are?
-Let's go!

34:34.947 --> 34:37.033
-Yeah.
-We got a show to do!

34:37.116 --> 34:37.992
-[Karamo] You ready?
-[Rahanna] Yes.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.702
-My love, after you.
-Okay.

34:39.786 --> 34:41.829
[Jonathan] Are we just doing it
right here, with our outfit?

34:42.747 --> 34:44.082
[Antoni] Good job, Tanny.

34:44.165 --> 34:46.667
[dance music playing]

34:51.214 --> 34:52.048
[Antoni] Here you go.

34:53.007 --> 34:54.300
-[Jonathan] That's for you.
-[Rahanna] Yeah, over here.

34:54.383 --> 34:55.510
[Antoni] That's cute.

34:55.593 --> 34:58.262
[Jonathan] Yes, madame. Go, go, yes, yes!

34:58.346 --> 34:59.972
[barking]

35:02.558 --> 35:05.394
Okay... it's <i>Home Alone 1,</i>
and everyone's about to go to Paris,

35:05.478 --> 35:08.356
but in this case, Stylish Pooch has got
its first-ever fashion show to put on.

35:08.731 --> 35:11.359
No French tuck.
You may lose points for it.

35:11.818 --> 35:13.361
That's all. Thank you.

35:13.861 --> 35:18.574
We're leaving no one behind.
Bobby and Karamo are on hype and planning.

35:19.033 --> 35:22.829
[Antoni] One for the bag, one for Walter!

35:22.912 --> 35:24.205
[Jonathan] Antoni is on treats.

35:24.288 --> 35:25.581
[Antoni] Bark if you like pretzels.

35:25.665 --> 35:26.541

-[shouts]

35:27.041 --> 35:27.917
Come on, final look.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.420
Tan is on being ruthlessly judgmental
of all these poor pooches.

35:31.504 --> 35:35.091
Ooh, it's a little bit scraggly.
Don't embarrass us, you're our house dog.

35:35.174 --> 35:36.092
I'm on glam.

35:36.175 --> 35:38.094
A full face of makeup.

35:38.177 --> 35:41.180

35:53.442 --> 35:55.570
-[Sanaj] Happy.

Everyone's pumped, everyone's excited.

Let's bring it in before I get out there.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.937
-Let's do "pawpin.'"
-Pawpin'!

[cheering]

36:43.409 --> 36:45.870
How is everybody doing tonight?

36:48.331 --> 36:51.167
This night is about Stylish Pooch,

36:51.250 --> 36:55.004

37:10.144 --> 37:13.356
We also have our very own Anna Wintour.

37:13.773 --> 37:16.108
Let's give it up for Tanny France!

37:16.192 --> 37:18.069
[cheering]

37:18.152 --> 37:20.196
-[Karamo] She's already unamused.
-[laughing]

37:20.279 --> 37:22.281
[Karamo]
But this show is not about any of us.

37:22.657 --> 37:24.283
Give a big round of applause

37:24.367 --> 37:28.788
for the owner and creator
of Stylish Pooch, Rahanna!

37:28.871 --> 37:31.707
[cheering]

37:32.625 --> 37:34.001
Show them what you got.

37:34.710 --> 37:35.920
[laughs]

37:36.963 --> 37:38.422
[Karamo] Yes, honey!

37:42.426 --> 37:45.596
Everyone go to Stylish Pooch,
follow on Instagram.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.932
-[Jonathan] Yes!
-[Karamo] Now, the judges will be judging

37:48.015 --> 37:49.100
on two categories,

37:49.600 --> 37:52.311
swag and wag. You got that, judges?

37:52.395 --> 37:54.480
-Yeah!
-Swag refers to the dog's outfit,

37:54.563 --> 37:57.191
and wag is all about the attitude.

37:57.275 --> 38:00.945
So, please, Rahanna,
tell everyone about your journey

38:01.028 --> 38:03.030
-with Stylish Pooch.
-Okay. Um...

38:04.115 --> 38:04.949
[exhales]

38:07.535 --> 38:08.536
-Sorry.
-We got you.

38:08.619 --> 38:11.080
Take your time...
Go ahead, take your time.

38:13.082 --> 38:15.960
Stylish Pooch has been a crazy journey,

38:16.877 --> 38:18.796
lots and lots of ups and downs.

38:19.588 --> 38:21.048
Grooming is my passion,

38:21.716 --> 38:24.468
and it has always been my passion.
I love animals.

38:25.011 --> 38:28.681
But the biggest thing for me is
to be what I always wanted to be,

38:28.764 --> 38:30.016
a mobile dog groomer.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.226
Making dogs look cute,

38:32.935 --> 38:34.895
adding swag to their wag.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.481
-[laughing]
-[cheering]

38:37.606 --> 38:39.608
-Are we ready to get the show started?
-Ready.

38:39.692 --> 38:41.819
All right!
Are you all ready to see the fashion show?

38:42.611 --> 38:47.199
[Rahanna] Diego is a mighty protector,
who looks after his brother Timmy.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.869
[Karamo] They are absolutely "paw-fect."

38:49.952 --> 38:52.663
Red's the color of the season.
Tens across the board!

38:53.164 --> 38:56.083
Those first two were groomed
by our very own.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.585
[audience shouting]

38:57.668 --> 38:59.545
Is this next one groomed by you? Okay.

38:59.628 --> 39:00.629
But it will be.

39:00.713 --> 39:01.756
-Yes.
-But it will be.

39:02.089 --> 39:04.592
[Rahanna]
Next up, we have Francine Flowers.

39:04.675 --> 39:08.429
-Sounds like a drag name, and I love it!
-[Rahanna laughs] Come through.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.265
That wig is taking me out.

39:11.349 --> 39:15.436
[Karamo] It's the '80s, and she is ready
to come and swag.

39:15.519 --> 39:17.605
[Rahanna] Next up, we have Marley.

39:18.814 --> 39:22.276
-She puts the "gold" back in <i>Golden Girls!</i>
-Yes.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.653
Rahanna is slaying it.

39:25.029 --> 39:27.948
[Rahanna] Snickers is 15
and hasn't lost the pep in his step.

39:28.032 --> 39:31.786
I know, that's right.
Look at that mustache. Work it.

39:32.161 --> 39:33.871
So French.

39:34.246 --> 39:36.123
[Karamo] Come on out, Yogi and Keenan.

39:36.207 --> 39:39.460
-Yogi is also one of my clients.
-Yes!

39:39.668 --> 39:42.129
This is the Rahanna
that the world needs to see.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.297
[laughs]

39:43.381 --> 39:45.341
[Karamo] That grooming is impeccable.

39:45.424 --> 39:46.801
[Tan] Well done, sir!

39:47.385 --> 39:48.803
Oh, look at that.

39:54.433 --> 39:56.102
[Karamo] We got tens across the board.

39:57.269 --> 39:59.730
-Little Gremlin!
-Tens.

39:59.814 --> 40:02.191
-[Karamo] She's a Hawaiian goddess.
-[woman] Eight!

40:03.609 --> 40:07.196
[Karamo] Meatball is single
and ready to fla-mingle.

40:07.738 --> 40:10.491
Aww! Definitely ten.

40:10.574 --> 40:13.953
Bella is a sweet baby girl
with a smile that lights up the town.

40:15.746 --> 40:19.125
-Florals for spring.
-[Rahanna] Yes, rock it, Bella.

40:19.208 --> 40:20.418
Groundbreaking.

40:21.001 --> 40:23.879
Look at the ears. Look at those ears!

40:23.963 --> 40:27.174
Oh, Antoni,
we'll call this the corgi parade.

40:27.883 --> 40:29.510
There is a corgi orgy

40:29.593 --> 40:32.179
-waiting for you.
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

40:32.263 --> 40:35.933
[Karamo] Get in there, Antoni.
All these corgis are for you, love.

40:36.016 --> 40:38.727
I love you so much!

40:38.811 --> 40:40.146
I love you.

40:40.771 --> 40:43.732
Antoni, we've got a show to do,
move it along.

40:44.024 --> 40:45.985
Ten... Ten.

40:46.068 --> 40:47.611
Ninety-one!

40:47.695 --> 40:50.573
-[laughing]
-That was cute!

40:50.823 --> 40:52.324
[Karamo] Anna Wintour, are you impressed?

40:54.452 --> 40:56.078
Everyone, give it up for Walter.

40:56.162 --> 41:00.416
His fashion sense is out of this world.
Tanny is jealous.

41:00.499 --> 41:01.667
[Rahanna laughs]

41:01.750 --> 41:04.128
Why did we put Walter in a trash bag?

41:04.211 --> 41:05.045
[laughing]

41:05.129 --> 41:07.590
[Karamo] Not only is this our final dog
of the evening,

41:07.673 --> 41:11.802
but this dog was recently styled
by our very own Rahanna.

41:11.886 --> 41:13.721
[cheering]

41:13.804 --> 41:15.139
[Karamo] So, give it up for dog, Lulu.

41:16.348 --> 41:17.641
[laughing]

41:17.725 --> 41:19.894
[Karamo]
She is in a rock band, and she loves it.

41:19.977 --> 41:22.563
Add some color, make her cute.
I could do that.

41:22.646 --> 41:25.399
-Rahanna, that's amazing.
-[laughs] Thank you.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.235
Give it up again for all
of our stylish pooches tonight.

41:29.236 --> 41:32.406
Also, give it up
for our very amazing, Rahanna.

41:33.407 --> 41:34.909
Yes, bitch!

41:35.951 --> 41:38.204
[Karamo] Judges, we're gonna head inside
to deliberate.

41:40.581 --> 41:43.501
Go, babe!

41:43.584 --> 41:45.920
Go! Go! Go! Go!

41:47.379 --> 41:49.715
This is coming from
a purely objective place,

41:49.798 --> 41:51.383
but I definitely think the corgis.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.844
-The corgis?
-They did the least.

41:53.928 --> 41:55.095
It was so basic.

41:55.179 --> 41:58.557
Fashion shows really bring out
the worst in you, Tan, I have to say.

41:59.308 --> 42:02.269
[Jonathan] Eighties girl is third,
dinosaur dog is second,

42:02.811 --> 42:05.064
-[Antoni] Yes.
-[Karamo] No. I'm not agreeing.

42:05.147 --> 42:07.191
-The gymnastics one is--
-No!

42:07.274 --> 42:09.652
Gymnastics owner
looked better than the dog.

42:09.735 --> 42:11.862
-You didn't like the wig?
-[Karamo] If somebody had a wig

42:11.946 --> 42:13.739
that wasn't staying on,
we would all read that.

42:13.822 --> 42:17.910
As the CEO of the Stylish Pooch,
she gets to make the final call.

42:17.993 --> 42:21.247
If Rahanna is happy
that's all I care about.

42:23.040 --> 42:25.042
[shouting]

42:26.752 --> 42:28.337
Oh, my God!

42:28.921 --> 42:29.755
Shh!

42:31.090 --> 42:33.884
[Karamo] Okay, Bobby, can I announce?
I'll call you all when I'm ready.

42:34.593 --> 42:35.594
Welcome back.

42:35.678 --> 42:38.722
We have a winner, and that winner is...

42:41.517 --> 42:43.519
Rahanna!

42:43.602 --> 42:45.604
[audience shouting]

42:56.740 --> 42:58.200
[Rahanna sobbing]

43:02.621 --> 43:05.332
[Karamo]
Stylish Pooch is back in business, baby.

43:06.417 --> 43:07.918
[Rahanna blubbers]

43:09.587 --> 43:11.672
Oh, my God, it's so beautiful.

43:12.548 --> 43:14.633
-[Tan] Did she expect this?
-[Bobby] No.

43:15.426 --> 43:17.761
Oh, my goodness, you guys are the best.

43:19.555 --> 43:21.348
Does she deserve this? Yes.

43:21.557 --> 43:26.270
Is it extra as hell? Absolutely.
But what else would you expect from us?

43:26.729 --> 43:29.148
-You don't understand...
-[Jill] No, y'all don't understand.

43:29.231 --> 43:32.026
...how much this means to me.
I had so many people say,

43:32.109 --> 43:35.988
"Oh, my God, we're gonna help you..."
And nothing ever happens.

43:36.071 --> 43:38.240
And you guys... [sobbing]

43:39.241 --> 43:40.326
You guys...

43:41.035 --> 43:42.661
You guys mean so much to me.

43:44.371 --> 43:45.623
[Karamo] This is your fresh start.

43:46.165 --> 43:49.209
Never stop believing in yourself.
You've had it all along.

43:49.501 --> 43:50.669
You hit a hard time,

43:50.919 --> 43:54.131
but you are destined for even greater
things than you can imagine.

43:54.214 --> 43:55.591
[Rahanna] Yes, thank you.

43:55.674 --> 43:59.053
I'm so ready for the new and improved
Rahanna and Stylish Pooch,

43:59.136 --> 44:02.181
-and it's all because of you guys.
-[Bobby] We believe in you so much.

44:02.264 --> 44:03.182
What are you? A--

44:03.557 --> 44:05.809
Boss bitch. Okay?

44:05.893 --> 44:07.978
[cheering]

44:08.479 --> 44:10.230
[Bobby] We'll hug again. Hug again.

44:11.940 --> 44:14.318
Failure is really just a matter
of perception.

44:14.401 --> 44:15.736
We're proud of you.

44:15.819 --> 44:18.364
What we have to do is just keep going
until we get the next yes.

44:18.447 --> 44:19.281
Dog treat?

44:19.365 --> 44:21.742
[Jonathan ]When we keep focused
on what it is that we love to do,

44:21.825 --> 44:24.578
there is no limit to what the universe
can have in store for us.

44:24.662 --> 44:27.331
Oh, my gosh, it's so cute.

44:27.414 --> 44:29.333
I'm feeling gorgeous. Okay?

44:29.792 --> 44:30.626
[laughs]

44:30.709 --> 44:34.129
I learned to love myself,
be patient with myself and my business.

44:34.213 --> 44:35.047
Good.

44:35.130 --> 44:37.841
You can't move forward
if you don't let go of the past.

44:38.258 --> 44:40.219
Stylish Pooch is back mobile,

44:40.302 --> 44:43.764
and we  about to add swag
to the city's wag, okay?

44:43.847 --> 44:44.973
[laughs]

44:53.941 --> 44:55.609
[Karamo] I want you to bang it out.

44:55.693 --> 44:56.902
[Jonathan] Get it, girl!

44:58.487 --> 45:00.823
You better give it, Beyoncé, yes!

45:01.198 --> 45:02.324
Yes!

45:06.995 --> 45:08.122
[cheering]

45:08.205 --> 45:10.541
I'm letting go of the past! Whoo!

45:10.624 --> 45:11.583
Bye-bye, baby!

45:12.167 --> 45:13.961
[shouting]

45:17.005 --> 45:19.383
[Karamo]
Out with the old. Let's start anew.

45:20.509 --> 45:21.468
[laughs]

45:21.552 --> 45:22.845
And that's how you do it.

45:23.846 --> 45:24.888
[Rahanna] Take that!
