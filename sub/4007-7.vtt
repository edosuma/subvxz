00:10.520 --> 00:12.273
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:12.600 --> 00:16.036
It's no accident
that Zach Hamilton is here.

00:16.239 --> 00:17.913
He's drawn to blood, like me.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.835
The arterial spurting here...

00:21.040 --> 00:25.557
...indicates that the killer severed
the carotid artery with the first stab.

00:26.440 --> 00:29.638
- I'm promoting Miller to sergeant.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

00:29.840 --> 00:33.197
You actually made me want this,
and now you're gonna take it away.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.795
I just did a little research on you.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.316
You checked into me, like a criminal.

00:38.640 --> 00:40.233
Hey, Niki...

00:40.880 --> 00:42.997
Dexter, this is Oliver. Oliver, Dexter.

00:43.160 --> 00:44.719
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.672
Zach Hamilton killed Norma Rivera.
He deserves to die.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.878
Isn't that a little intolerant
coming from you?

00:54.040 --> 00:57.158
What if you were to teach Zach
the code?

00:57.400 --> 01:00.837
Maybe it's time to see
if the experiment will work.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.232
What possibly makes you think
Zach could be taught the code?

01:04.400 --> 01:05.595
I see something in him.

01:05.760 --> 01:07.717
Why were you going
to kill your father?

01:07.920 --> 01:09.832
Because he's killing my mother.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.310
She's drinking herself to death
because of him.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.756
You killed because you want to kill.

01:14.920 --> 01:18.550
- You should just go ahead and kill me.
- Why?

01:18.760 --> 01:20.911
Because if you don't,
then I will do it again.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.480
I can't help it.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.354
Am I ready to be a spiritual father?

01:27.200 --> 01:28.316
Hey, you okay?

01:28.520 --> 01:31.479
- I don't feel so good.
- Deb?

01:35.800 --> 01:37.712
Hello, Dexter.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.272
Remember me?

03:54.240 --> 03:56.709
- Hello?
<i>- Dexter?</i>

03:56.920 --> 03:59.276
<i>I was just about to leave you
another message.</i>

03:59.440 --> 04:00.954
<i>Where have you been all morning?</i>

04:01.120 --> 04:03.476
<i>The last thing I remember is...</i>

04:04.760 --> 04:06.240
<i>...Hannah.</i>

04:06.400 --> 04:07.834
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

04:08.000 --> 04:10.390
<i>Not if Hannah got to Deb.</i>

04:12.920 --> 04:14.149
I can't really talk now.

04:14.320 --> 04:17.711
I just thought you should know
that Zach Hamilton called.

04:17.880 --> 04:20.873
I'm so glad you decided
not to kill him, Dexter.

04:22.320 --> 04:23.720
I have to go.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.678
Deb, are you okay?

04:25.840 --> 04:27.240
Dex, where the fuck are you?

04:28.120 --> 04:29.839
Just a sec.

04:32.120 --> 04:34.794
I'm outside of Kendall.
Are you alone?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.879
Why wouldn't I be?
Why are you on the other side of town?

04:38.240 --> 04:40.880
I need you to come pick me up.
Are you okay to drive?

04:41.040 --> 04:44.397
I think so.
I mean, who the fuck knows?

04:44.560 --> 04:48.315
I woke up on the floor feeling like shit.
You were gone.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.995
What the fuck is happening?

04:51.160 --> 04:54.153
<i>Just come pick me up.
I'll text you the location.</i>

04:54.320 --> 04:56.471
<i>We'll talk when you get here.</i>

04:58.240 --> 04:59.515
<i>Hannah drugged us...</i>

04:59.680 --> 05:02.070
<i>...left me stranded
in the middle of nowhere.</i>

05:02.280 --> 05:05.432
<i>If she's come back because she wants
one or both of us dead...</i>

05:06.360 --> 05:09.000
<i>...then why are we both still here?</i>

05:14.880 --> 05:17.759
- It was Hannah, wasn't it?
- It was.

05:19.680 --> 05:23.799
I saw her before I blacked out,
and then I woke up here.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.633
She must have drugged our food.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.356
If Hannah poisoned us,
why didn't she kill us?

05:28.520 --> 05:31.399
Who the fuck knows, Dexter?
Maybe we were supposed to eat more.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.592
Or she wants to let us know
she's out there.

05:33.760 --> 05:36.116
Maybe this was just the beginning.

05:38.240 --> 05:42.393
If we were normal people, we would go
to the U.S. Marshals Service.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.711
We can't do that.
She knows everything about me.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.315
She didn't talk about you
last time she was arrested.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.836
Because she was in love with me.

05:50.880 --> 05:55.511
Drugging me and leaving me on
the road might suggest that's changed.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.438
So, what the fuck
are we supposed to do?

06:00.520 --> 06:03.479
There are traffic-surveillance
cameras.

06:04.360 --> 06:05.794
She had to have passed them.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.714
I'll put in a request for the footage,
get a license plate.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.832
I thought this part
of my life was over.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.798
So did I.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.314
The moment I asked you to kill her...

06:24.480 --> 06:26.517
...was the moment
I started to lose myself...

06:26.680 --> 06:29.036
...and I'm just starting to get back.

06:32.160 --> 06:34.391
I don't wanna deal with this.

06:35.480 --> 06:36.675
I want her gone.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.717
Deb, I'll take care of this. I promise.

07:04.440 --> 07:08.070
<i>Hannah. Just thinking about her
throws me off course.</i>

07:13.800 --> 07:17.350
<i>I have to put in a request
for the traffic footage.</i>

07:26.200 --> 07:28.237
Zach, what are you doing here?

07:28.400 --> 07:31.040
You were supposed to meet me
at 10:00 this morning.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.954
- You could have been followed.
- By who? Oh, Detective Quinn?

07:34.120 --> 07:35.918
- No, he's pretty easy to lose.
- Yeah.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.955
But one day, he'll be there
when you don't expect him.

07:39.120 --> 07:41.112
Don't ever come to my home again.

07:41.280 --> 07:42.999
- I just wanted to talk to you--
- Ever.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.715
We can't be seen in public together.
Do you understand?

07:46.880 --> 07:50.510
- That's your first lesson.
- Jeez, I'm sorry. It's just...

07:50.680 --> 07:55.880
- I spoke to Dr. Vogel, and she--
- What exactly did she tell you?

07:58.160 --> 08:03.394
That you have this, like,
way of living that...

08:06.120 --> 08:10.239
...allows you to do
what you and I have in common...

08:12.520 --> 08:14.989
...and that might be something
that I can do too.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.878
I mean, fuck,
I have so many questions.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.269
And I'll answer them as best I can.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.677
Are you gonna help me be like you?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.911
Don't even pretend.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.480
Hi, Dexter.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.634
- Going for a little night swim.
- Enjoy.

08:39.240 --> 08:42.711
- Who's she?
- That's my neighbour.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.554
- She's cute.
- Yes, she's cute.

08:45.720 --> 08:46.949
You need to go home.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.271
- When are we gonna talk about--?
- I'll call you.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.591
Something has come up
that I have to deal with.

08:51.800 --> 08:55.510
It's my day job,
which is something you need to get.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.110
Why? I have money.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.192
You're a weird guy
who lives with his mom.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.033
You might as well be wearing a sign.

09:02.400 --> 09:07.156
Look, all I'm saying is that you need
to have some kind of cover life...

09:07.320 --> 09:09.710
...something that makes you
look ordinary.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.599
Yeah, right, yeah. I get it, yeah.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.837
Zach, I understand
what you're going through.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.480
I will help you with this.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.959
Okay.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.673
Thanks.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.312
Not a single sighting
since she disappeared?

09:35.480 --> 09:37.233
Thank you.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.437
Motherfuck.

09:41.720 --> 09:44.360
- What you doing?
- Nothing.

09:44.560 --> 09:46.472
Why do you look like
you just got caught?

09:48.840 --> 09:50.877
Come on, what are you doing?
Looking at porn?

09:51.040 --> 09:52.474
- No.
- Company computer.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.235
- Will you--?
- And I am the boss.

09:56.320 --> 09:59.358
Hannah McKay.
Wayne Randall's girlfriend, right?

09:59.520 --> 10:02.672
Got arrested a while back
for something, then slipped away?

10:02.840 --> 10:05.036
- Why you looking her up?
- None of your business.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.759
Will you fucking back off?

10:06.960 --> 10:08.235
- Jesus, relax.
- No, I'm ser--

10:08.400 --> 10:10.790
You come in here all the time
and invade my space.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.595
You stand so close, try to flirt.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.553
You're fucking
making me uncomfortable.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.194
I didn't come in here to flirt.

10:17.360 --> 10:21.513
I just came in here to see if you wanted
me to pick you up something for lunch.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.951
I'm all set.

10:27.880 --> 10:28.916
Are we done?

10:30.080 --> 10:31.560
Yeah.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.992
Yeah, we're done.

10:36.080 --> 10:38.914
You know what?
We're not done, actually.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.232
See, Deb, you came to me
six months ago an emotional wreck...

10:43.400 --> 10:45.676
...saying you quit the force
and you needed a job.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.069
I gave you that job.

10:47.240 --> 10:50.472
I gave you good pay, good benefits.
I didn't ask a lot of questions.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.314
I put up with a lot of weird shit
from you...

10:53.480 --> 10:56.791
...because you're good at your job,
and because I'm a nice guy.

10:56.960 --> 11:01.318
So I'm really, really sorry
if this cramps your style...

11:01.480 --> 11:04.791
...but next time, maybe you wanna try
a little gratitude...

11:04.960 --> 11:08.158
...instead of always being
such a fucking bitch.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.037
Now we're done.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.478
<i>There she is.</i>

11:34.640 --> 11:37.360
<i>"Vista Marina Car Rentals."</i>

11:55.040 --> 11:57.839
<i>Vista Marina Car Rentals.
This is Stacy. How may I help you?</i>

11:58.000 --> 12:01.596
Hi, Stacy. This is Detective Cooper
over at Miami Metro.

12:01.760 --> 12:05.390
My badge number is 143634.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.552
We're investigating a hit-and-run.

12:07.720 --> 12:11.350
We think somebody who rented one of
your vans might have been a witness.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.910
I was hoping to get some information
over the phone.

12:14.080 --> 12:17.596
I can fax you over a copy
of the warrant if you'd like.

12:18.160 --> 12:20.914
<i>Oh, I'll just get it for you.
Do you have the license plate?</i>

12:21.080 --> 12:26.951
Yes, I do. It's GLV43951.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.520
<i>The name on that account
is Maggie Castner.</i>

12:30.680 --> 12:33.593
<i>The local address is Slip 23,
Vista Marina.</i>

12:33.760 --> 12:35.319
Thank you, Stacy.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.392
<i>Want the phone number?</i>

12:39.440 --> 12:41.511
Yes, that would be helpful.

12:41.680 --> 12:44.036
<i>813-398-2723.</i>

12:46.320 --> 12:47.993
You may have found her.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.112
If so, a little too easily.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.590
You think she wants to be found?

12:52.760 --> 12:57.312
I think she wants to destroy our lives,
mine and Debra's both.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.756
Debra's very fragile right now.

12:59.960 --> 13:04.079
The threat of Hannah coming after her
could derail the progress she's making.

13:04.240 --> 13:06.994
- I won't let that happen.
- So, what's your plan?

13:08.600 --> 13:11.991
- Slip 23.
- You have her number. You could call.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.913
I don't wanna let her know
I've found her yet.

13:16.080 --> 13:19.551
Why do you seem less scared
than excited?

13:19.720 --> 13:21.757
Because Hannah doesn't scare me.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.832
Maybe you need to rethink that.

13:28.440 --> 13:29.954
They look like nice apartments...

13:30.160 --> 13:32.516
...but you should work things out
with your brother.

13:32.680 --> 13:35.036
Angel and I are gonna be fine.
I've just had it...

13:35.200 --> 13:38.318
...with the whole "big brother
ruling over the roost" routine.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.120
And the thing is...

13:44.200 --> 13:45.520
What?

13:45.720 --> 13:48.838
Well, just most of these places,
I have to sign a one-year lease...

13:49.000 --> 13:51.435
...and I wasn't sure about...

13:52.360 --> 13:54.079
About what?

13:54.240 --> 13:57.039
Okay. I'm definitely not pushing you,
okay?

13:57.200 --> 13:59.431
I'm just trying to be practical here.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.991
If our relationship
keeps moving forward...

14:03.160 --> 14:06.517
...we might want to eventually
get a place together.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.357
- Yeah, eventually.
- You don't have to decide now.

14:10.520 --> 14:15.470
- It's just something to think about.
- Yeah, I'll totally think about it.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.714
Okay.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.920
I'm so sorry.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.992
I blew that whole thing
out of proportion.

14:24.160 --> 14:27.471
I just felt like you were trying to, like,
get rid of me with the cheque.

14:27.640 --> 14:31.554
I was just trying to be a good,
you know, father.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.080
That was really sweet of you.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.517
But it's my problem,
and I wanna take care of it.

14:37.480 --> 14:39.278
Well, I can respect that.

14:39.480 --> 14:40.755
- So we're cool?
- Cool.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.912
How about you and I
do dinner tonight?

14:43.080 --> 14:46.437
I can't.
I have to work right after class.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.672
- You know, pay off the debts.
- Well, good for you.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.593
Where are you working?

14:52.240 --> 14:55.278
It's a sports bar called Lucky Pete's.

14:56.080 --> 14:59.232
I can call you though, when I'm free.
We can get together.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.797
Okay. Sounds great.

15:21.320 --> 15:24.518
<i>The Hannah McKay I know
hated the ocean.</i>

15:25.560 --> 15:29.839
<i>But it does make for an easy escape
into international waters.</i>

15:32.040 --> 15:35.511
<i>Brave of her
to be walking around Miami like that.</i>

15:36.520 --> 15:39.638
<i>Or maybe she's found someone
to protect her.</i>

16:38.160 --> 16:40.311
- May I help you?
- I'm just meeting some friends.

16:40.520 --> 16:42.637
I'm sorry, sir. Members only.

16:42.800 --> 16:43.950
Oh, but I'm a friend of--

16:44.120 --> 16:46.954
Even so, sir,
we have a strict dress code.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.438
Call it a night, Dexter.

17:02.600 --> 17:05.115
- You don't wanna go in there.
- I do wanna go in there.

17:05.280 --> 17:08.876
It's their territory.
You'll be at a disadvantage.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.633
I need to know what she's up to.

17:22.599 --> 17:23.636
Dexter.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.520
Is your father a member
of the Red Coral Club?

17:26.680 --> 17:30.071
Yeah.
It's full of old farts in suits. Why?

17:30.240 --> 17:32.709
Can you get me in there? Tonight?

17:33.120 --> 17:35.555
Yeah. Sure.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.517
Good to see you, Mr. Hamilton.

17:55.560 --> 17:56.960
This way.

17:58.920 --> 18:03.039
- So, what are we doing here?
- Looking for someone.

18:03.360 --> 18:05.716
I thought we weren't supposed
to be seen together.

18:05.880 --> 18:07.837
This is different.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.753
You know her?

18:16.800 --> 18:18.917
That's my ex-girlfriend.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.154
Nice.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.754
Who's the guy?

18:23.920 --> 18:25.036
I'm gonna find out.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.633
All right, you keep an eye on him.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.759
- You text me when he's coming back.
- Got it.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.316
Hannah.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.751
It's Maggie now.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.639
You shouldn't be here, Dexter.

18:55.480 --> 18:58.996
I'm not leaving until you tell me why
you drugged me and left me on the road.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.511
After what you did to me, I'm not sure
that you get to ask questions.

19:02.680 --> 19:05.639
But here I am, asking.
What are you doing back in Miami?

19:05.800 --> 19:08.793
I was about to enjoy a martini.

19:10.080 --> 19:13.232
You should probably leave though,
before my husband returns.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.437
Your husband?

19:19.360 --> 19:21.317
You're married to that guy?

19:27.080 --> 19:28.400
Yes. I'm very lucky.

19:28.920 --> 19:31.992
Yeah. Well, he seems rich.
You were always a pragmatist.

19:32.160 --> 19:35.153
Well, the money's nice,
I have to admit...

19:35.360 --> 19:38.558
...but he has other talents.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.599
Miles is the adventurous type.

19:45.600 --> 19:48.434
- What are you doing here?
- My husband will be back any minute.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.354
It's in your best interest
that he not see us together.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.479
I'm not leaving until you tell me
why you did what you did.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.314
I see you've made a friend.

19:56.560 --> 20:00.110
This is my husband, Miles Castner.

20:00.280 --> 20:03.751
Dexter Morgan.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.639
Maggie has told me about you.

20:07.240 --> 20:10.312
How you were her boyfriend
until you betrayed her...

20:10.520 --> 20:12.159
...turning her in to the police.

20:12.320 --> 20:15.154
Quite a predicament you left her in.

20:15.320 --> 20:17.630
Shall we finish our drinks?

20:20.320 --> 20:21.879
I think it's time for us to go.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.038
Well, that's an excellent idea.

20:24.240 --> 20:27.278
Make sure Mr. Morgan
is given whatever he needs.

20:36.040 --> 20:38.874
Didn't you get my text?
I warned you the guy was coming.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.315
I know.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.513
So why didn't you walk away?

20:42.720 --> 20:45.315
I mean, I watched him.
I stayed on him. I didn't fuck up.

20:45.480 --> 20:49.713
I screwed up, not you.
You did exactly as I asked you to.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.953
- So, what now?
- Nothing.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.592
I'll call you. We'll talk tomorrow.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.594
So that guy, are we go--?

21:05.600 --> 21:07.432
You gonna kill him?

21:09.600 --> 21:12.399
I only kill people who deserve it.

21:14.280 --> 21:16.954
<i>--do you hear?
Because something sure ain't right.</i>

21:17.120 --> 21:19.430
<i>While them orphans was camping
in the woods...</i>

21:19.600 --> 21:21.557
<i>...something gave them
a proper fright.</i>

21:21.720 --> 21:26.590
<i>Miles Castner made his fortune
in international casinos.</i>

21:26.800 --> 21:30.953
<i>He has the power and the reach to
get Hannah a new name, new passport.</i>

21:31.360 --> 21:33.955
<i>But if she's as happy as she seems
in her new life...</i>

21:34.120 --> 21:37.955
<i>...then why is she here,
messing with mine?</i>

21:38.560 --> 21:42.873
<i>Miles Castner.
What kind of name is Miles, anyway?</i>

21:44.320 --> 21:48.360
<i>Don't be a chump, Zoomer.
Ain't no such thing as...</i>

21:48.840 --> 21:51.196
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

21:53.040 --> 21:54.872
Hello?

21:55.080 --> 21:56.275
Harrison, hello?

21:58.760 --> 22:00.513
That's it?

22:01.360 --> 22:03.352
I remember when I used to get a hug.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.910
Hey, even I don't matter
when <i>Rastamouse</i> is on.

22:06.080 --> 22:09.471
I checked in with Marshals, FBI,
fucking Homeland Security.

22:09.680 --> 22:12.195
There hasn't been a single sighting
of Hannah McKay.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.955
- I'm hoping you've had better luck.
- Yeah.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.032
I found her.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.236
She's married.

22:19.520 --> 22:21.637
Well, there's someone for everyone,
I guess.

22:23.160 --> 22:26.073
I hope he's sleeping
with one eye open.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.873
What's her married name?

22:28.040 --> 22:30.350
The guy she's married to
is worth $700 million.

22:30.520 --> 22:32.955
He owns casinos.

22:33.480 --> 22:35.995
The name, Dex.

22:37.080 --> 22:40.710
Castner. Miles Castner.

22:40.920 --> 22:43.640
They're staying on his yacht.

22:43.840 --> 22:47.993
I don't know what they're doing
in Miami. Maybe he has business here.

22:48.840 --> 22:51.992
He seems to know who she is...

22:52.160 --> 22:54.436
...even knows about her and me.

22:54.920 --> 22:59.119
And she seems to like him.

22:59.280 --> 23:01.590
Or maybe she just feels
obligated to him.

23:01.760 --> 23:04.639
I doubt Hannah McKay
feels obligated to anyone.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.395
It's gotta be operational.
She needs a cover life.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.598
It's not like it's a real marriage.

23:10.760 --> 23:14.595
She can't actually love this guy.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.638
Oh, my God.

23:19.600 --> 23:23.276
- You're still in love with her.
- What? No.

23:23.440 --> 23:25.909
She's probably trying to kill me.

23:31.040 --> 23:34.238
Trust me,
no one knows what it's like...

23:34.400 --> 23:37.313
...to fall in love with the wrong person
more than I do.

23:39.120 --> 23:42.158
But you better get
your fucking head on straight.

23:42.920 --> 23:45.276
She is everything that is wrong
with our lives.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.912
She is a vortex. She is a black hole.

23:49.080 --> 23:54.314
She sucks everything into her being,
leaving nothing behind.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.429
We have got to get her
out of our lives.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.717
I'm working on a plan.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.991
Are you sure you can be objective?

24:08.720 --> 24:10.916
One little toss
of Hannah's pretty blond hair...

24:11.080 --> 24:13.231
...and you turn into a fucking moron.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.680
Hannah?

24:17.000 --> 24:18.320
Hannah is here?

24:19.600 --> 24:21.910
Both of you? Jesus. Really?

24:22.080 --> 24:23.673
Deb, I'm on top of it.

24:24.120 --> 24:26.760
I'm gonna figure out
exactly what she's up to.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.759
Are you?

24:31.680 --> 24:33.956
Where is Hannah?

24:34.560 --> 24:40.158
Right now she's on a very big boat
with her husband.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.433
Niki.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.636
Hey. Hey, what are you doing here?

24:57.800 --> 24:59.393
I came here to see you.

24:59.600 --> 25:02.638
I didn't realise
this place was a breastaurant.

25:05.040 --> 25:07.236
I mean, it is a sports bar,
it's just topless.

25:07.440 --> 25:11.514
- And I make really good money here.
- Are you really okay doing this?

25:11.680 --> 25:15.276
Yeah. It's not the best job in the world,
but it's also not forever.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.160
I'm fine with it.
I can tell that you're not.

25:18.320 --> 25:19.720
Me?

25:20.360 --> 25:22.920
Look, I go to places like this
all the time.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.236
- See?
- I've--

25:24.400 --> 25:26.915
Look, I've stared at a million boobs,
but until now...

25:27.080 --> 25:29.390
...I've never considered them to be...

25:29.560 --> 25:30.676
...daughter boobs.

25:32.400 --> 25:35.950
- Daughter boobs?
- Well, come on. You know what I mean.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.999
Guy, hey. Her face is up here, okay?
Come on.

25:39.160 --> 25:40.992
It's so sweet that you care.

25:41.160 --> 25:44.597
I'm just gonna stay here until
something better comes along, okay?

25:44.760 --> 25:47.434
Yeah, I'll...
I'll let you do your thing.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.592
You wanna have dinner
on my next free night?

25:49.760 --> 25:50.955
Yeah.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.677
That's great.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.273
It actually makes sense in a way...

25:58.440 --> 26:01.000
...that Dexter would have been
involved with another killer.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.078
Well, she's back.

26:03.240 --> 26:06.039
And she poisoned us.
Who knows what else she has planned?

26:06.200 --> 26:07.236
What does Dexter say?

26:07.400 --> 26:09.232
He's trying to figure out
what she's up to...

26:09.400 --> 26:11.596
...but he's thinking
with the wrong head.

26:11.760 --> 26:14.434
- You're concerned for your safety.
- And for Dexter's.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.234
Let's take a step back.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.880
From what you've told me...

26:18.040 --> 26:20.509
...if she wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead by now.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.110
Maybe she just wants to prove
that she has control.

26:23.280 --> 26:25.033
She can kill us whenever she wants.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.715
- It's a very unsettling feeling, isn't it?
- Yeah.

26:27.880 --> 26:29.155
What is it you'd like to do?

26:29.320 --> 26:32.836
I'd like to take her to Marshal Services
and have her the fuck arrested.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.276
- But Hannah knows too much.
- Yeah.

26:36.880 --> 26:40.556
But at least I wouldn't have to worry
about what might be in my coffee.

26:43.400 --> 26:49.032
When the Brain Surgeon was out there,
a threat to me, I could hardly sleep.

26:49.200 --> 26:54.195
I trusted Dexter to solve the problem,
and he did.

26:58.560 --> 26:59.596
And if I can't?

26:59.800 --> 27:02.076
Before you take matters
into your own hands...

27:02.240 --> 27:05.358
...be sure to consider
all the consequences of those actions.

27:08.400 --> 27:10.790
<i>The husband is a complication
I don't need.</i>

27:10.960 --> 27:15.876
<i>I have to get Hannah alone,
in a situation I control.</i>

27:17.040 --> 27:19.839
Have you done the blood work
on the triple in Lummus Park?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.640
- Not yet.
- There's the prints on the bottle to run...

27:22.800 --> 27:25.520
...and the decomp over in
Coconut Grove we have to process.

27:25.680 --> 27:27.194
Yep.

27:28.120 --> 27:31.352
We could use an extra set
of hands, right?

27:31.520 --> 27:32.749
Someone lower level...

27:32.960 --> 27:35.839
...an extra warm body to offset
the cold ones, don't you think?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.515
At least to make a dent
in the paperwork.

27:38.680 --> 27:42.230
- Sure, I guess.
- Excellent idea.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.117
<i>Zach. What's he doing here?</i>

27:57.080 --> 27:58.514
Quinn.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.556
Okay.

28:08.720 --> 28:11.599
My client requests
that you cease and desist...

28:11.760 --> 28:14.514
...this 24-hour watch
you have on him.

28:14.680 --> 28:18.071
He requests it.
I'd like you to back the fuck off.

28:30.680 --> 28:33.479
- You took these photos, Zach?
- Yeah.

28:33.640 --> 28:36.678
- Those are just the best ones.
- Quinn, you have anything to say?

28:36.840 --> 28:39.958
- I think the kid's guilty.
- I'll answer for you, Detective Quinn.

28:40.120 --> 28:42.999
On behalf of the entire department,
I can assure you we will--

28:43.200 --> 28:45.795
Well, how did you put it, Zach?
--back the fuck down.

28:45.960 --> 28:47.394
- "Off."
- Yeah, that too.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.752
Right Detective Quinn?
,

28:50.520 --> 28:52.193
- Right.
- That's right.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.750
Gentlemen, let me show you out.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.036
What were you thinking?

29:03.200 --> 29:05.351
That rich asshole
is walking around free.

29:05.520 --> 29:08.354
- We have nothing on this kid.
- That's why I was following him.

29:08.520 --> 29:11.354
If this was any other case,
I would sign off on the overtime.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.552
But this one...

29:14.680 --> 29:17.149
...let it go. That's an order.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.800
By the way,
me and Jamie are moving in together.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.553
You're what? You're doing what?

29:25.720 --> 29:27.837
- Hey, you got a minute?
- Make it fast.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.515
Okay, well, Dexter and I are buried
in that glass box.

29:30.680 --> 29:32.831
- We need an assistant.
- I don't know about that.

29:33.040 --> 29:35.555
We've been under budget
the last three quarters.

29:36.080 --> 29:39.630
- It was Dexter's idea.
- Okay. Part-time.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.360
You're one hell of a lieutenant.

29:52.880 --> 29:55.634
The photos were a nice touch.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.160
Thanks. I thought so.

30:03.040 --> 30:07.592
Well, now he's off my tail,
we can get down to business.

30:07.760 --> 30:09.877
You know, find someone to...

30:10.040 --> 30:12.271
- You know.
- Eventually.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.432
What do you mean, "eventually"?

30:14.600 --> 30:16.353
I mean...

30:18.120 --> 30:21.158
Long before my father taught me
how to do what I do...

30:21.320 --> 30:24.472
...he taught me how not to do it.

30:24.640 --> 30:26.871
Why would I want to not do it?

30:27.040 --> 30:29.475
Timing is everything.

30:29.680 --> 30:33.754
One thing you need to learn,
the first thing that I had to learn...

30:33.920 --> 30:35.673
...is to wait.

30:35.840 --> 30:41.040
Control your urges.
Channel them appropriately.

30:42.480 --> 30:43.960
Dexter, I can't wait.

30:44.520 --> 30:48.116
- I can't control it.
- Yes, you can.

30:48.960 --> 30:51.634
You're gonna get your chance, Zach,
I promise.

30:51.800 --> 30:55.350
But the only way I've survived
as long as I have is by being careful.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.955
I'm gonna teach you how to do that.

30:58.120 --> 30:59.520
And then?

30:59.680 --> 31:02.752
And then you'll be able
to do what I do...

31:02.960 --> 31:04.235
...and get away with it.

31:34.120 --> 31:36.555
- What do you want?
- I saw you with your son.

31:37.120 --> 31:39.715
Maggie never mentioned him.

31:39.880 --> 31:41.678
Hard to picture her
as the family type.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.036
There's nothing going on
between Hannah and me.

31:44.200 --> 31:45.395
Good. Then listen.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.631
I'd sooner see her in prison
than lose her.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.832
Do you understand?

31:50.000 --> 31:52.913
Because I could call a few people
and ruin your life.

31:53.360 --> 31:58.037
And being a family man,
I'm sure that's not what you'd want.

32:01.320 --> 32:04.472
People are so impatient.

32:14.600 --> 32:15.829
Dexter, what are you doing?

32:16.840 --> 32:19.514
This is something
you don't wanna get in the middle of.

32:22.640 --> 32:26.156
He said he'd sooner see her in prison
than lose her.

32:26.320 --> 32:29.631
If that's what he thinks this is about,
she's the one in danger.

32:29.840 --> 32:33.356
I thought you were gonna find out if
Hannah was a threat to you and Debra...

32:33.520 --> 32:35.751
...not if Miles was a threat to Hannah.

32:39.200 --> 32:41.795
Why can't I do both?

33:14.800 --> 33:16.553
Your flowers.

33:18.080 --> 33:21.869
That's the thing about plants.
You don't look after them, they die.

33:27.200 --> 33:30.238
So, what's up?

33:30.880 --> 33:34.157
Miles just confronted me
at a gas station.

33:34.360 --> 33:35.760
God.

33:35.920 --> 33:39.391
- He likes to be dramatic.
- Is he a threat?

33:39.560 --> 33:42.951
A "chop you up and toss you
in the ocean" kind of threat?

33:43.160 --> 33:44.799
No.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.437
But he could make your life miserable,
have people look into you...

33:48.600 --> 33:51.195
...and follow you around 24/7.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.999
He sounds like a great guy.

33:53.160 --> 33:56.517
And you're really in a position
to judge?

33:56.720 --> 33:57.836
Why did you marry him?

33:58.000 --> 34:00.356
Because he was there
when you weren't.

34:02.720 --> 34:05.360
I needed him, Dexter.

34:05.880 --> 34:09.317
I met him a few years ago when I did
some flowers for him at an event...

34:10.480 --> 34:13.154
...and he found
my background intriguing.

34:13.360 --> 34:16.159
I could tell he had a crush on me,
so when I made my escape...

34:16.360 --> 34:18.272
...when I had nothing
and was desperate...

34:18.440 --> 34:20.750
...I knew that he could give me
a whole new life...

34:20.920 --> 34:23.833
...a new identity, money.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.995
Plus, he makes me happy.

34:29.560 --> 34:30.596
Bullshit.

34:31.600 --> 34:34.434
If you're so damn happy,
what are you doing back here?

34:35.040 --> 34:36.759
Why'd you drug Debra and me?

34:36.920 --> 34:38.672
- I think you should go.
- Answer me.

34:39.199 --> 34:41.317
I wanted to make sure
you weren't gonna put me in jail.

34:41.480 --> 34:45.030
- I had to see if you would come to me.
- I did, and you haven't told me why.

34:45.199 --> 34:46.953
Because it doesn't matter why
anymore.

34:47.120 --> 34:50.158
- I changed my mind.
- About what?

34:52.560 --> 34:55.757
I wanted you to kill Miles for me.

34:59.040 --> 35:00.759
You what?

35:02.480 --> 35:04.472
He's possessive and controlling...

35:04.640 --> 35:07.758
...and obsessed with me to the point
where he follows me everywhere.

35:07.920 --> 35:10.310
I might as well be in prison.

35:10.480 --> 35:14.156
If I were to try and leave him,
he would just turn me in.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.630
Why haven't you dealt with this
in your usual way?

35:16.840 --> 35:20.038
His family already thought I was
some gold digger when we got married.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.953
If he was gonna drop dead
suddenly...

35:22.120 --> 35:24.760
...I would be the first person
that they would turn to.

35:25.040 --> 35:28.556
- Once the cops get a good look at me--
- You wanted me to make him disappear.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.071
I thought you might feel like
you owed me.

35:34.240 --> 35:36.550
- Owed you?
- You didn't have to turn me in.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.439
- You ruined my life.
- I did.

35:38.600 --> 35:41.877
It doesn't even matter anymore,
because like I said, I changed my mind.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.350
This is my problem,
and I'm gonna deal with it.

35:44.520 --> 35:46.557
Why did you change your mind?

35:47.360 --> 35:49.829
Because the moment
that I saw you there unconscious...

35:50.040 --> 35:52.839
...I realised that despite
the shitty way that it all ended...

35:53.040 --> 35:54.918
...you were it for me, Dexter.

35:57.920 --> 36:02.597
I've never felt that way about anyone
before or since.

36:05.240 --> 36:08.597
You're the only person
that I can be that honest with.

36:11.040 --> 36:12.520
And I didn't wanna ruin that...

36:12.680 --> 36:18.472
...by manipulating you into doing
something that might be bad for you.

36:24.360 --> 36:26.955
It was the same for me.

36:30.040 --> 36:33.829
No, just leave it at that. I have to go
before Miles finds out where I've gone.

36:34.040 --> 36:37.033
- Hannah.
- Goodbye.

36:44.720 --> 36:45.995
Hey.

36:46.160 --> 36:50.598
Can I borrow that high-tech
GPS tracker thingy that you have?

36:52.800 --> 36:54.473
Please?

36:55.080 --> 36:57.993
Yeah. Being nice
when you need something, huh?

36:58.160 --> 37:00.197
I'm not surprised.

37:04.240 --> 37:07.358
Sorry that I overreacted earlier.

37:08.400 --> 37:12.155
I know that you're interested.

37:12.320 --> 37:13.640
You act like you are.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.998
But, Jake,
you don't wanna get involved with me.

37:17.160 --> 37:18.913
You have no idea who I really am.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.354
I just want a chance to find out.

37:42.840 --> 37:45.196
Can I help you? Is that your car?

37:46.400 --> 37:48.392
It's my brother's car.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.870
I think I left my sunglasses
in the passenger seat.

37:51.080 --> 37:53.675
- He's not answering his phone.
- Your brother is...?

37:53.920 --> 37:56.196
Dexter Morgan.
He lives in the building.

37:56.360 --> 37:58.875
Oh, you're Dexter's sister.
I'm Cassie, his neighbour.

37:59.040 --> 38:00.110
Debra. Oh, fuck.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.237
You're Cassie.
You went out with him, right?

38:02.680 --> 38:04.273
Really? He mentioned me?

38:04.440 --> 38:06.272
- You look surprised.
- I am.

38:06.440 --> 38:09.478
I guess I figured he thought
I was the worst date ever.

38:09.680 --> 38:10.955
He didn't exactly follow up.

38:11.120 --> 38:14.397
But he's nice to me when I see him.
He's kind of impossible to read.

38:14.600 --> 38:16.990
- Yeah, that would be Dexter.
- Oh, okay, good.

38:17.160 --> 38:20.153
- I was starting to think it was me.
- Nope, definitely not you.

38:20.360 --> 38:24.513
Hey, since I've got you here,
what's his deal?

38:24.840 --> 38:26.877
Jamie seems to think
he's not over his ex...

38:27.040 --> 38:28.759
...which makes him more attractive.

38:28.920 --> 38:31.230
Apparently, I have a thing
for unavailable men.

38:31.400 --> 38:32.834
Sorry. That was an overshare.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.356
- That's all right. I get it.
- It's so crazy, right?

38:35.520 --> 38:38.115
I meet this totally nice guy
who's completely into me...

38:38.280 --> 38:41.318
...and I'm still hung up
on the mysterious man next door...

38:41.480 --> 38:43.437
...who hasn't called.

38:43.600 --> 38:45.478
I don't know you...

38:45.640 --> 38:49.316
...at all, actually, but you seem
like a normal girl, you know?

38:49.480 --> 38:53.156
If I were you, I would stick with the guy
that's obviously interested.

38:55.520 --> 38:59.116
Trust me, Dexter is not a mystery
that you wanna solve.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.316
Okay. Yeah. Sorry about all that.

39:04.480 --> 39:07.040
- It's all right. Have a good one.
- See you.

39:12.880 --> 39:14.473
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:14.640 --> 39:16.791
You could've come inside.
I just got your text.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.311
Well, you know, I think I've seen
enough of that place, you know.

39:20.480 --> 39:22.312
So, what brings you by?

39:22.480 --> 39:23.709
I wanted to let you know...

39:23.920 --> 39:26.992
...that a lab-assistant position
just opened up at Miami Metro...

39:27.160 --> 39:29.117
...and it's yours if you want it.

39:29.280 --> 39:30.350
What does it pay?

39:30.520 --> 39:33.194
Thirteen seventy-five an hour,
plus dental.

39:33.920 --> 39:35.718
I make a lot more money
than that here.

39:35.880 --> 39:38.998
You did say that this wasn't
your first choice as a line of work.

39:39.160 --> 39:42.471
I figured you'd jump at the chance for a
future that didn't include pole dancing.

39:42.640 --> 39:45.360
I'm not gonna be a stripper, Dad.

39:47.680 --> 39:50.240
Hey, it just slipped out.

39:51.360 --> 39:53.829
That's okay.
Well, listen, just do me a favour.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.229
Just think about it, okay?

39:55.400 --> 39:57.392
I think it would be good
for the both of us.

39:57.560 --> 39:59.597
Okay. All right.

40:01.320 --> 40:02.549
- Bye.
- Bye.

40:05.680 --> 40:08.514
Well, that's probably best
for all involved.

40:08.680 --> 40:11.514
Two psychopaths together.

40:12.040 --> 40:15.750
- Never a good mix.
- Hannah's not a psychopath.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.874
- She has feelings.
- I'll have to take your word for that.

40:19.040 --> 40:22.829
Anyway, I called you over here tonight
because I'm concerned about Zach.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.754
He came to me today
in a very agitated state.

40:25.920 --> 40:29.755
I didn't let him kill his father and now
he's feeling the urge more than ever.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.912
And how do you plan to handle it?

40:33.600 --> 40:36.434
I was 10 years old when Harry told me
what my future would be.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.399
I didn't kill until I was 19.

40:40.680 --> 40:44.959
Zach can wait.
He just doesn't know he can.

40:45.720 --> 40:48.155
Apples and oranges, Dexter.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.512
- Sorry?
- You thought you had no choice...

40:50.680 --> 40:53.559
...but to wait
because your father told you to.

40:54.080 --> 40:58.393
But you were just a boy
who'd never taken a human life.

40:58.600 --> 41:00.956
- Zach has already killed.
- Don't get me wrong.

41:01.120 --> 41:03.510
I'm glad you took him off your table.

41:03.680 --> 41:08.232
But the moment you did,
Zach became your responsibility.

41:09.840 --> 41:12.116
He's relying on you, Dexter.

41:12.960 --> 41:16.032
You need to take this very seriously.

41:20.280 --> 41:23.318
<i>Hi, you've reached Zach Hamilton.
Please leave a message.</i>

41:23.480 --> 41:25.676
Hey, Zach. It's Dexter.

41:25.840 --> 41:30.710
Let's meet tomorrow afternoon, 2 p.m.
I'll come to your studio.

41:38.920 --> 41:40.832
<i>It's good that Hannah's leaving.</i>

41:41.000 --> 41:44.835
<i>I have enough on my plate
trying to turn a young killer into...</i>

41:46.800 --> 41:49.076
<i>...someone like me.</i>

42:24.440 --> 42:27.831
<i>Miles knows that Hannah and I
saw each other yesterday.</i>

42:29.800 --> 42:32.554
<i>If Miles will do this to me...</i>

42:33.520 --> 42:35.671
<i>...what will he do to her?</i>

42:38.520 --> 42:40.910
So who you tracking?

42:41.120 --> 42:42.679
I'm just kidding, obviously.

42:42.840 --> 42:46.231
I don't wanna invade your privacy.
I just wanna see if you need anything.

42:46.400 --> 42:48.232
- I'm good.
- Okay.

42:49.320 --> 42:51.073
Jake.

42:55.040 --> 42:58.317
I know I can be
kind of a dick sometimes.

42:58.480 --> 42:59.596
You don't deserve that.

43:01.160 --> 43:05.313
It's okay. Most people think
I'm a dick too, so I guess we're even.

43:05.760 --> 43:08.514
This past year hasn't been my best.

43:09.240 --> 43:13.951
The truth is, I wouldn't be surviving it
if it weren't for you, so thank you.

43:15.160 --> 43:16.913
You're welcome.

43:34.640 --> 43:36.393
Dexter?

43:44.760 --> 43:46.274
Come on, what the fuck? Dexter!

43:46.440 --> 43:50.070
It looks like he's not home.

43:57.560 --> 44:00.678
- Can I give him a message?
- Yeah. Fuck him.

44:11.480 --> 44:12.914
Hey, babe.

44:13.080 --> 44:14.639
Good hunting?

44:14.800 --> 44:17.952
Yeah, I found a couple dresses.
I think you'll really like them.

44:18.120 --> 44:19.440
Nice.

44:19.600 --> 44:23.196
I'm guessing today's shopping
went better than yesterday's.

44:23.360 --> 44:25.397
- About the same.
- Really?

44:25.600 --> 44:28.991
That's surprising, considering there
probably isn't much of a selection...

44:29.160 --> 44:31.117
...at your old greenhouse.

44:32.440 --> 44:33.954
What are you talking about?

44:34.120 --> 44:36.840
You were with your friend...

44:38.640 --> 44:40.711
...Dexter Morgan.

44:42.760 --> 44:44.752
Well, he a--
He asked to see me.

44:44.920 --> 44:48.596
He wanted to make sure that I was
all right after you confronted him...

44:48.760 --> 44:50.797
...and I told him
that everything was fine...

44:51.000 --> 44:53.595
...that we were very happy together,
end of story.

44:53.760 --> 44:55.911
Don't lie to me. I know the truth.

44:56.080 --> 44:58.549
No, Miles, I told you,
I don't care about him anymore.

44:58.720 --> 45:01.110
- So you won't be too upset, then.
- About what?

45:01.280 --> 45:04.273
About what yesterday's excursion
is going to cost your friend.

45:04.440 --> 45:07.000
- Miles, that's unnecessary.
- You've made it necessary.

45:07.160 --> 45:09.072
No, please, don't hurt him.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.152
Don't hurt him?
Why, because you love him?

45:11.320 --> 45:13.994
No, I promise you,
I'm not ever gonna see him again.

45:14.160 --> 45:16.834
He's the reason you insisted
on coming with me to Miami...

45:17.000 --> 45:19.515
...returning to a place
where you're a wanted criminal.

45:19.680 --> 45:20.830
Miles.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.072
He's the unfinished business
you mentioned.

45:28.280 --> 45:32.115
I want you to know I forgive you.
We're going to make a new beginning.

45:32.280 --> 45:34.511
I've already told the crew
we're leaving tonight.

45:34.680 --> 45:36.956
We'll sail up the coast
and cross the Atlantic...

45:37.120 --> 45:39.430
...just the two of us,
for the rest of our lives.

45:39.600 --> 45:42.479
- That's how much I care about you.
- No, Miles. Stop it, please.

45:42.640 --> 45:46.520
- You'll never have to leave this boat.
- Stop, please.

45:47.920 --> 45:51.118
I've given you everything.
You belong to me.

45:51.280 --> 45:54.318
No, stop it. Get off.

46:33.880 --> 46:36.520
I... I tried to run...

46:38.960 --> 46:40.280
...but he just grabbed me.

46:44.440 --> 46:47.035
I didn't mean for it
to happen this way.

46:48.080 --> 46:49.878
Are you hurt?

46:51.960 --> 46:53.872
I'm okay.

46:57.760 --> 47:00.036
We need bleach, bags...

47:01.360 --> 47:05.877
...something to cut with,
an axe or a saw or something like that.

47:06.640 --> 47:08.199
You think you can get me those...

47:08.360 --> 47:11.353
...without letting the crew know
that anything's wrong?

47:13.520 --> 47:16.080
Yeah, I think so. Yes.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.360
Wait, you need to change.

47:22.280 --> 47:24.078
- Right.
- Hannah.

47:27.080 --> 47:28.116
It's gonna be okay.

47:30.920 --> 47:33.276
I'll take care of everything.

47:39.040 --> 47:40.952
I believe you.

47:59.360 --> 48:02.432
So that's how you make
people disappear.

48:03.680 --> 48:07.117
Give or take a plastic room
and a kill table, yeah.

48:07.320 --> 48:09.551
Yeah, I remember that part.

48:31.480 --> 48:33.949
Do you ever wish
that you had followed through?

48:36.280 --> 48:38.112
With killing me?

48:39.600 --> 48:41.193
No.

48:45.040 --> 48:46.554
You ever wish you had?

48:47.680 --> 48:49.717
I was never going to kill you, Dexter.

48:51.760 --> 48:53.433
It's just...

48:55.200 --> 48:59.114
Well, I knew I couldn't live with Miles
for much longer...

49:01.280 --> 49:03.749
...and unlike you,
I don't actually enjoy any of this.

49:07.720 --> 49:09.677
So, what's next?

49:10.840 --> 49:14.550
I told the crew that Miles was going
to New York for a few days...

49:14.760 --> 49:17.719
...so that should buy me some time.

49:31.040 --> 49:32.315
What's wrong?

49:33.680 --> 49:36.275
I have to go to a crime scene...

49:36.680 --> 49:38.273
...at my apartment building.

49:38.680 --> 49:41.115
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

49:41.280 --> 49:43.158
I have to go.

49:46.040 --> 49:48.874
Please don't leave town
before we talk again.

49:51.080 --> 49:52.150
I won't.

50:15.320 --> 50:17.789
<i>This could be my apartment.</i>

50:34.320 --> 50:36.437
<i>Cassie.</i>

50:37.440 --> 50:39.159
Dexter?

50:44.160 --> 50:45.560
What happened?

50:46.920 --> 50:49.196
I don't know. I just got here.

50:49.400 --> 50:53.599
Cassie and I, we were supposed
to have a date tonight.

50:54.480 --> 50:55.834
I'm sorry.

51:00.240 --> 51:02.630
I know you were friends.
You okay to work this?

51:02.800 --> 51:05.110
Yeah. Yeah.

51:10.720 --> 51:12.518
What do you see?

51:14.480 --> 51:16.437
She was bludgeoned.

51:16.600 --> 51:17.920
See those marks on her neck?

51:18.080 --> 51:20.072
Someone held her down
and beat her to death.

51:20.240 --> 51:21.959
God.

51:27.720 --> 51:30.155
<i>Norma Rivera was bludgeoned.</i>

51:30.320 --> 51:34.360
<i>Is it possible Zach did this
when I was with Hannah?</i>

51:36.320 --> 51:42.191
<i>Harry was a good teacher to me
because he was normal, human.</i>

51:42.360 --> 51:46.877
<i>But can anything good come
from putting two killers together...</i>

51:47.080 --> 51:52.633
<i>...whether it be student and teacher
or whatever Hannah and I have?</i>

51:53.640 --> 51:56.712
<i>Or will it always end the same way...</i>

51:56.920 --> 51:58.912
<i>...like this?</i>
