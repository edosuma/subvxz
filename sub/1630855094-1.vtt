11:40.860 --> 11:43.100
- Where are we going?
- [quietly] Shh! We can't talk.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.000
They're close now.
You'll wake them.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.790
- Wake who?
- Shh!

11:49.400 --> 11:50.410
No, no, no.
Victor, we need to stop.

11:50.610 --> 11:51.930
You need to tell me
what's going on.

11:52.130 --> 11:54.110
- Where are we?
- We're underneath the town.

11:54.310 --> 11:57.460
This is where the monsters live.
This is where they sleep.

11:57.660 --> 11:58.980
But I can get us out.

11:59.180 --> 12:00.720
The boy in white,
he showed me the way.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.160
The what?

12:02.360 --> 12:04.950
I went through the tree,
then I was here.

12:05.150 --> 12:07.240
He told me to wait for you.
He showed me where to hide.

12:08.940 --> 12:10.340
It's okay to be scared.

12:10.540 --> 12:12.130
We just need to be quiet.

12:12.330 --> 12:14.030
We just have to--

12:28.480 --> 12:30.320
- What the fuck?
- What?

12:30.520 --> 12:33.100
We have to hurry.
They'll be awake soon.

12:35.050 --> 12:36.010
Yeah.

12:37.140 --> 12:38.240
- Deep breath, okay?
- Okay.

12:38.440 --> 12:39.940
Yeah. Don't touch.

12:40.140 --> 12:41.810
All right.
One, two... three.

12:42.010 --> 12:43.200
Aah!

12:43.400 --> 12:44.990
Don't touch it, okay?
You're doing great.

12:45.190 --> 12:46.510
All right. Don't touch.
Don't touch.

12:46.710 --> 12:48.250
Tell everyone
unless they're bleeding,

12:48.450 --> 12:49.950
they better be securing
the goddamn windows.

12:50.150 --> 12:51.290
Okay.

12:52.850 --> 12:55.000
- Mattias, grab the shotguns.
- Got it.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.260
We don't need to do that.

12:56.460 --> 12:57.520
No?

12:57.720 --> 12:59.780
There's a fucking bus
down there.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.480
God knows how many people
with zero idea

13:01.680 --> 13:03.220
of the shit storm
they just rolled into.

13:03.420 --> 13:05.090
How do you think
they're gonna react

13:05.290 --> 13:06.430
when we tell them
they can't leave?

13:08.960 --> 13:10.360
Look.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.350
We have a long night
ahead of us.

13:13.220 --> 13:16.050
Boyd picked one hell of a time
to go on safari.

13:16.830 --> 13:20.850
If this shit goes sideways,
you have to be ready to step up.

13:21.050 --> 13:21.930
You got that?

13:23.280 --> 13:24.450
You're sheriff now.

13:25.890 --> 13:26.980
- Kristi?
- Yeah?

13:27.180 --> 13:29.250
Grab your stuff.
Meet us down at the diner.

13:29.450 --> 13:31.160
We're about to make
some new friends.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.990
[passenger laughing]

13:34.190 --> 13:35.040
It's locked.

13:35.240 --> 13:39.250
[laughs, whoops]

13:40.990 --> 13:43.040
Fuckin' shirt.

13:43.240 --> 13:47.440
You all, come join me!

13:47.640 --> 13:49.880
Ha ha!

13:50.080 --> 13:51.300
Whoo! Whoo!

13:55.390 --> 13:57.190
Ahh.

13:57.390 --> 13:59.450
Oh, the sun! Ha ha ha!

13:59.650 --> 14:01.110
No way.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.530
Ah.
Rain dance is done.

14:05.270 --> 14:07.890
Just follow my finger
with your eyes.

14:08.090 --> 14:09.810
Good.

14:10.010 --> 14:12.020
Great. Okay.
Can I see your hand?

14:15.460 --> 14:17.110
Okay, pulse is good.

14:18.290 --> 14:19.990
No sign of a fever.

14:20.190 --> 14:22.430
Look,
I need everybody off the bus.

14:22.630 --> 14:24.260
Seriously?

14:24.460 --> 14:26.600
Just give us a minute.
Please?

14:28.650 --> 14:31.000
You a doctor or something?

14:31.200 --> 14:33.140
Pediatric nurse.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.360
Oh.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.270
Hey.

14:36.470 --> 14:38.050
Hey, what's your name?

14:41.440 --> 14:42.360
Elgin.

14:42.560 --> 14:43.570
Elgin?

14:44.970 --> 14:46.360
Elgin, do you know
where you are?

14:48.450 --> 14:49.880
Do you?

14:51.230 --> 14:52.890
Why were you screaming
like that?

14:56.720 --> 14:59.470
I had a really bad dream.

14:59.670 --> 15:01.860
Hey. Hey, what the fuck
was that?

15:02.060 --> 15:03.210
- Hey.
- Back off, man.

15:03.410 --> 15:04.170
Why don't you back off?
I'm the one

15:04.370 --> 15:05.430
with fuckin' puke
on my shirt.

15:05.630 --> 15:07.560
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

15:07.760 --> 15:08.600
I'm sorry.

15:10.250 --> 15:11.440
You're a goddamn freak.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.560
Let's give him
some space, okay?

15:19.000 --> 15:19.660
Excuse me.

15:19.860 --> 15:21.090
You alright, man?

15:23.050 --> 15:24.920
Smells fuckin' terrible
in here.

15:25.790 --> 15:27.150
Asshole.

15:27.350 --> 15:28.540
Hey, cut the guy
a break.

15:28.740 --> 15:29.970
Do you wanna go outside?

15:32.620 --> 15:34.190
Elgin?

15:37.020 --> 15:39.900
How about I just sit here
with you until you're ready?

15:40.100 --> 15:40.940
Okay?

15:45.200 --> 15:46.460
Okay.

15:52.340 --> 15:54.340
[pants]

15:55.650 --> 15:56.920
Oh, my God.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.570
Julie! Hey.

15:58.770 --> 16:00.400
- I need to find my dad.
- Wait, wait, wait.

16:00.600 --> 16:03.180
Ellis!
Pretty crazy, huh?

16:03.380 --> 16:04.570
Maybe the magic tower
summoned them.

16:06.480 --> 16:07.930
You ever see
something like this?

16:08.130 --> 16:10.500
- [Julie] Dad? Dad?
- Nope. These people are fucked.

16:10.690 --> 16:12.980
[Driver] Everybody?
Everybody gather round.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.630
Gather round.
Just want y'all to sit tight.

16:15.830 --> 16:18.070
I'm gonna clean things up in
there and we'll be on our way.

16:18.270 --> 16:19.940
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi.

16:20.140 --> 16:21.720
Uh, listen.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.160
There's gonna be a bunch
of people on their way down.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.510
- Mmm.
- Um...

16:24.710 --> 16:26.550
And they're gonna help
you guys out, alright?

16:26.750 --> 16:28.560
So we'll get
the diner unlocked,

16:28.760 --> 16:30.210
and we'll get you guys
sorted out.

16:30.410 --> 16:32.000
Okay, well, this isn't
a pit stop, okay?

16:32.190 --> 16:34.990
So unless you have a mop,
I'm good. Thanks.

16:37.860 --> 16:39.960
Holy shit.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.220
What happened?

16:41.420 --> 16:43.170
- The floor just--
- [Jim] I don't know.

16:46.260 --> 16:47.360
Where's Mom?

16:47.560 --> 16:50.360
I, uh... Ethan?

16:50.560 --> 16:52.060
Uh, where's Ethan?

16:52.260 --> 16:53.580
[stammers] He's fine.
He's at Colony.

16:53.780 --> 16:54.630
Dad, is she down there?

16:54.830 --> 16:57.670
Julie, listen to me.

16:57.870 --> 16:59.410
I need you to
get help, okay?

16:59.610 --> 17:01.190
Get as many people
as you can.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.800
Julie!

17:07.720 --> 17:10.080
Okay. All right.
Come here. Come here.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.420
[cries]

17:15.510 --> 17:18.610
Now is the time for you
to be strong.

17:18.810 --> 17:20.430
Your mom needs you, okay?

17:20.630 --> 17:22.080
Go and get help.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.560
- Okay.
- Go. Now.

17:31.700 --> 17:33.710
- You sure you're okay?
- Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

17:33.910 --> 17:35.150
- Okay. Just let me know...
- [Julie] Ellis!

17:35.340 --> 17:36.620
...if you need anything.
What's wrong?

17:36.820 --> 17:38.280
- It's my mom. She's trapped.
- Wait, wait. What?

17:38.480 --> 17:40.150
She was digging in the basement.
My dad's inside.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.670
- She needs help. Please.
- Whoa, whoa. Stay with the bus.

17:42.870 --> 17:44.460
- I got this.
- You sure?

17:44.660 --> 17:45.630
You're not gonna do much
with that.

17:45.830 --> 17:48.640
I'm a bartender.
Crowd control's my thing.

17:48.840 --> 17:52.030
Hey, people? We got a little
situation on our hands here.

17:52.230 --> 17:53.470
Listen up.

17:53.670 --> 17:55.170
There's a woman trapped
in the basement

17:55.360 --> 17:57.430
of that house over there.
Her husband's inside.

17:57.630 --> 17:59.160
We could use some help.

18:01.210 --> 18:02.220
Yeah. All right.

18:02.420 --> 18:04.090
Yeah. I'll help.

18:04.290 --> 18:05.350
- I'm going.
- No, no, no. Just stay there.

18:05.550 --> 18:08.090
Hey, no. I need everyone
to stay by the bus.

18:08.290 --> 18:09.830
Well, there's a woman
trapped in there.

18:10.030 --> 18:11.830
Then let emergency services
handle it.

18:12.030 --> 18:13.170
Oh, you're a peach.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.190
Okay. Okay, look.
You guys go.

18:16.390 --> 18:17.670
Listen. There are people
on the way.

18:17.870 --> 18:19.190
They're gonna help
everyone out, okay?

18:19.390 --> 18:21.060
They're gonna get everything
squared up. You're with--

18:21.260 --> 18:23.150
- Hey! Hey, no. Whoa.
- I'm going, too.

18:23.350 --> 18:26.270
They can't focus on your mom if
they're worried about you. Okay?

18:28.410 --> 18:31.110
Okay, come on. You're
needed here. Come with me.

18:33.590 --> 18:34.510
Remember, the most
important thing is--

18:34.710 --> 18:36.860
Keep everybody calm.
I know.

18:37.060 --> 18:39.510
Uh, you talk to the bus driver,
and I'll get everyone inside.

18:39.710 --> 18:40.900
- Let's go.
- Donna.

18:42.590 --> 18:44.340
We've got some problems.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.290
No shit.
Where's the driver?

18:47.690 --> 18:50.090
Folks, sorry about
your inconvenience here.

18:50.290 --> 18:52.830
Let's get you all inside, huh?
Get some tea brewing.

18:53.030 --> 18:54.820
Get you all warmed up.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.360
Sounds like
a good idea.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.620
- Right? Some tea sounds good.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

19:00.820 --> 19:04.190
Come on in, guys. Please.

19:04.390 --> 19:06.110
Let's go, folks.
Come on.

19:06.310 --> 19:07.320
Sorry again.

19:09.930 --> 19:11.680
[Tom] Jim!

19:11.880 --> 19:13.320
Oh, thank God.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.680
Who are they?

19:18.880 --> 19:22.340
We, uh...
our bus stopped here.

19:22.540 --> 19:24.380
- Your bus?
- Can you hear anything?

19:24.580 --> 19:25.860
- Is she talking?
- No.

19:27.770 --> 19:30.740
I, uh... no.

19:30.940 --> 19:34.310
What the fuck?
What was she doin' down here?

19:34.510 --> 19:36.170
[Jim] Digging to see
where the wires went.

19:37.260 --> 19:38.690
It doesn't matter.

19:40.260 --> 19:41.270
If she was digging
down here,

19:41.470 --> 19:43.440
what the hell caused that?

19:45.530 --> 19:46.930
Please just help me.

19:47.130 --> 19:50.240
Hey, bud, look at me.
Look at me.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.710
We're gonna get your lady
out of there, okay?

19:54.580 --> 19:55.460
[Jim]
Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:55.660 --> 19:56.980
Before you lift anything out,

19:57.180 --> 20:00.160
just make sure that it's not
holding up somethin' else.

20:00.360 --> 20:02.470
Last thing we want is
to collapse things further.

20:02.670 --> 20:04.550
[Tom]
Okay. Yeah. We got this.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.330
Let's get this done quickly,
alright?

20:09.810 --> 20:11.550
Yeah.
Come here. Wait, wait, wait.

20:13.730 --> 20:14.900
[Victor whispering]
Come.

20:17.910 --> 20:19.790
Come on.

20:19.990 --> 20:21.350
Are you sure
this is the right way?

20:21.550 --> 20:22.690
Shh.

20:29.830 --> 20:30.930
Oh, no, no, no.
Victor.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.450
No, we have to
keep going.

20:32.650 --> 20:33.930
No, no, no, Victor.
We have to go back.

20:34.130 --> 20:36.800
No way. There's no going back.
We have to go through.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.890
That's what he said.
We go while they sleep.

20:40.090 --> 20:43.280
You have to be brave.
We both have to be brave.

20:51.420 --> 20:53.290
Sara?

20:57.600 --> 20:58.820
Sara, you up there?

21:01.340 --> 21:03.430
You said we'd be safe
inside this tree. [laughing]

21:05.390 --> 21:09.260
Well, this does not feel
very safe to me, Sara.

21:12.610 --> 21:13.960
[man] Hey.

21:19.840 --> 21:20.930
Hello?

21:25.540 --> 21:27.410
Hey, is anybody up there?

21:28.980 --> 21:30.730
[man in the distance]
Are you real?

21:30.930 --> 21:31.980
What?

21:35.110 --> 21:36.730
[man] Are you real?

21:38.600 --> 21:41.610
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I'm real.

21:41.810 --> 21:44.350
Are you?
Are you fuckin' real?

21:44.550 --> 21:47.050
[man]
I can help you if you help me.

21:47.250 --> 21:48.400
Okay.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.310
[man] You promise?

21:50.510 --> 21:51.920
Yeah, man.
Anything you want.

21:52.120 --> 21:55.360
Just please,
just get me outta here, man.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.580
[man] You'll have to climb.

21:57.780 --> 21:59.020
What?

21:59.220 --> 22:00.890
No. I...

22:01.090 --> 22:02.720
[shouts] I can't.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.840
I just... tried.

22:06.890 --> 22:08.060
[man] Wait.

22:14.850 --> 22:16.030
[Boyd] Hey. What-- fuck!

22:17.850 --> 22:19.470
What?

22:19.670 --> 22:22.740
[man] You have to hurry.
They'll be back soon.

22:22.940 --> 22:25.820
Okay. All right.
Uh, okay.

22:29.950 --> 22:31.350
[Clara] Hey.

22:34.740 --> 22:36.920
Do you think
we made it angry?

22:37.120 --> 22:38.490
What are you
talking about?

22:38.690 --> 22:40.710
That storm
came out of nowhere,

22:40.910 --> 22:42.580
and the way
the lights exploded,

22:42.780 --> 22:44.920
it's almost like
we made something angry.

22:47.710 --> 22:48.840
What do we do now?

22:50.630 --> 22:53.330
Well...

22:53.530 --> 22:54.670
I got one rolling paper
left...

22:56.590 --> 22:57.680
...so I'm getting stoned.

23:00.500 --> 23:01.680
Okay.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.650
<i>[ominous synthesizer music</i>
<i>plays]</i>

23:19.570 --> 23:20.920
[dummy screams]

23:23.480 --> 23:25.400
[screams]

23:33.970 --> 23:36.410
Okay. Okay.

23:46.720 --> 23:48.510
Here. I found this.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.000
There's a lot
of broken glass.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.480
[speaks Cantonese]

23:55.680 --> 23:56.870
You careful.

24:00.090 --> 24:01.530
Why do you think
they broke?

24:01.730 --> 24:03.840
That was scary.

24:04.040 --> 24:05.610
Very scary.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.790
Do you think the others
will be back soon?

24:12.920 --> 24:15.940
You don't be afraid.
I protect you.

24:16.140 --> 24:17.490
I'm not afraid.

24:20.580 --> 24:23.510
Well, maybe
a little afraid.

24:23.710 --> 24:26.030
Sometimes
a quest can be scary.

24:26.230 --> 24:29.600
And when it gets close
to the end,

24:29.800 --> 24:31.730
that's when
it gets really scary.

24:33.160 --> 24:34.900
I guess we're sleeping here
tonight?

24:36.950 --> 24:38.690
Whatever.

24:45.260 --> 24:46.750
What are you doing
out here?

24:46.950 --> 24:48.480
Oh, for fuck's sake.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.010
Go back inside.

24:52.180 --> 24:53.710
Why?

24:53.910 --> 24:56.460
Because...

24:56.660 --> 24:58.010
You know, I don't know, kid.
Do whatever you want.

24:59.580 --> 25:02.020
You know cigarettes
are bad for you, right?

25:03.190 --> 25:04.930
It's not that kind
of cigarette.

25:06.850 --> 25:07.940
What's wrong with you?

25:09.850 --> 25:10.900
Gee, I don't know.

25:11.100 --> 25:12.560
I mean... [chuckles]

25:12.760 --> 25:13.780
maybe I just spent
the last week thinking

25:13.980 --> 25:16.480
we might actually
get out of this shit box,

25:16.680 --> 25:18.960
only to see our entire plan
come crashing down around us.

25:19.160 --> 25:20.260
Literally.

25:20.460 --> 25:22.660
So? We try again.

25:22.860 --> 25:24.480
Yeah.

25:24.680 --> 25:26.620
We'll get right on that, kid.

25:26.820 --> 25:28.570
Maybe we'll try
something else.

25:28.770 --> 25:30.530
Whenever the Cromenockle
failed, he always found--

25:30.730 --> 25:32.490
What the fuck
is a Cromenockle?

25:32.690 --> 25:35.220
- Oh. Um--
- No. I don't care.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.230
You're friends with Victor,
right?

25:42.060 --> 25:43.230
Do you know which room
is his?

25:44.410 --> 25:45.540
Why?

25:56.420 --> 25:59.640
[Tabitha whispering]
Okay. Shh.

26:06.080 --> 26:07.870
[Victor whispering]
Look. Right here.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.150
[gasps] Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

26:21.350 --> 26:22.720
[shushes]

26:22.920 --> 26:24.750
Let's go. Let's go.
Please, please, let's go.

26:33.940 --> 26:35.150
[Tabitha]
Oh, my God.

26:39.330 --> 26:40.590
Oh, my God.

26:44.120 --> 26:45.990
- Victor?
- Shh.

27:01.440 --> 27:02.400
What?

27:03.700 --> 27:05.360
- No, Victor!
- Come on.

27:18.810 --> 27:21.330
Victor, Victor, Victor?

27:24.380 --> 27:26.640
Victor, Victor?

27:32.170 --> 27:34.000
Victor, which way?

27:37.300 --> 27:39.920
[pants] Victor?

27:40.120 --> 27:43.270
[stammers] I don't know.
I got scared.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.280
What?

27:46.480 --> 27:48.980
This isn't the way
that he told me to go.

27:49.180 --> 27:50.190
- [moans]
- What?

27:50.390 --> 27:52.940
No, no, no. Victor, Victor.

27:53.140 --> 27:55.630
- Hey. Listen to me, Victor.
- Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

27:55.830 --> 27:56.720
Look at me. Look at me.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.290
- [moans]
- Yeah.

27:58.490 --> 28:00.070
I know you're scared.
I'm scared, too,

28:00.270 --> 28:01.770
but we have to
fucking move, okay?

28:01.970 --> 28:03.730
Please. Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

28:03.930 --> 28:05.250
We're going to do this
together, okay?

28:05.450 --> 28:07.730
It's okay. Let's go.
Please, Victor.

28:07.930 --> 28:09.650
Come on, Victor.
Please, please, please.

28:09.850 --> 28:11.030
Let's go.

28:12.770 --> 28:14.080
Let's go here.

28:20.220 --> 28:21.830
There's gotta be
something here!

28:22.030 --> 28:24.270
You shouldn't
be doing this.

28:24.470 --> 28:25.750
Victor wouldn't like it.

28:25.950 --> 28:28.230
All right.
Well, I got news for you, kid.

28:28.430 --> 28:31.710
Victor is, uh,
he's probably dead, alright?

28:35.230 --> 28:36.280
I'm sorry.

28:36.480 --> 28:38.070
I shouldn't have
said that.

28:38.270 --> 28:39.290
It's okay,

28:39.490 --> 28:42.330
'cause you're wrong.
He's fine.

28:42.530 --> 28:44.420
Wherever he is,
he's doing his part.

28:44.620 --> 28:46.250
Yeah? His part of what?

28:46.450 --> 28:47.420
The quest.

28:49.940 --> 28:51.120
Sorry, the what?

28:51.320 --> 28:53.950
That's what this is.
It's a quest,

28:54.150 --> 28:56.730
and everyone has
a part to play. Even you.

28:58.910 --> 29:00.960
Why do you care
so much about Victor?

29:01.160 --> 29:02.340
Because...

29:06.480 --> 29:07.840
All right, look.

29:08.040 --> 29:10.100
Between you and me,
alright,

29:10.300 --> 29:13.090
I have been seeing some
very crazy shit lately.

29:15.140 --> 29:17.020
You swear a lot.

29:17.220 --> 29:19.240
Get over here.
The point is,

29:19.440 --> 29:22.840
every time I see something
really weird, I see this.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.110
This symbol.

29:26.500 --> 29:27.940
Okay.

29:28.140 --> 29:29.820
Okay? I didn't draw this,
though. I found this.

29:30.020 --> 29:31.820
Well, Kenny's mom
gave me tea, and then she--

29:32.020 --> 29:33.170
When she-- Anyway, look.

29:33.370 --> 29:35.730
The point is,
this journal is old, alright?

29:35.930 --> 29:38.740
And whoever it belonged to kept
drawing the same weird symbol

29:38.940 --> 29:40.870
that I have been seeing

29:41.070 --> 29:44.130
over and over
and over again.

29:45.870 --> 29:50.010
I've been looking at this,
and then the other night,

29:50.210 --> 29:52.050
I noticed two of the pages
were stuck together.

29:53.610 --> 29:55.190
And in between there,
there's this, uh,

29:55.390 --> 29:57.320
this old Polaroid.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.980
- What's a Polaroid?
- Jesus fuckin' Christ. It's a--

30:00.180 --> 30:02.020
I'm sorry. It's a photo.
It's like a little photograph.

30:02.220 --> 30:03.940
How do you not know
what a Polaroid is? Come on.

30:04.140 --> 30:06.320
Here, look. This.
See this?

30:07.930 --> 30:09.450
What do you see?

30:10.980 --> 30:12.770
He's got the journal.

30:12.970 --> 30:14.160
Yeah.

30:14.360 --> 30:15.370
What else?

30:17.110 --> 30:19.130
That's Victor's lunchbox.

30:19.330 --> 30:21.210
Ah.
Not just Victor's lunchbox.

30:21.410 --> 30:23.560
That's Victor.

30:25.340 --> 30:27.260
- [Ethan] Really?
- Yeah.

30:27.460 --> 30:29.530
And if he was here
back when that guy was here--

30:29.730 --> 30:31.960
He might know
what the symbol means.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.530
Exactly.

30:33.730 --> 30:35.350
And that's why
I'm in his room.

30:36.660 --> 30:39.440
- So, we good?
- Well...

30:41.490 --> 30:43.060
...symbols
are important,

30:43.260 --> 30:44.410
especially on a quest.

30:44.610 --> 30:45.800
Yeah?

30:46.000 --> 30:48.200
But you have to figure out

30:48.400 --> 30:50.840
if they're good symbols
or bad symbols.

30:53.020 --> 30:54.900
Well, what do you mean?

30:55.100 --> 30:56.470
What do you mean,
"bad symbols"?

30:56.670 --> 30:59.550
Sometimes,
they make you do bad things.

31:03.200 --> 31:04.550
You're a creepy little kid.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.230
Okay. One big step.

31:17.430 --> 31:19.140
There you go.

31:19.340 --> 31:20.270
[Donna]
They will rip you to shreds.

31:20.470 --> 31:21.840
Let's just head around
the front, okay?

31:22.040 --> 31:23.060
[Donna]
It goes on and on.

31:23.260 --> 31:24.190
The point is, these things
don't just kill.

31:24.390 --> 31:25.450
Hold on. Stop.

31:25.650 --> 31:28.020
Is this--are you
out of your fucking mind?

31:28.220 --> 31:30.110
Look, I know
this sounds crazy,

31:30.310 --> 31:31.850
and there is not
a single reason in the world

31:32.050 --> 31:33.110
you should trust me.

31:33.310 --> 31:34.850
But if you get those people
back on this bus

31:35.050 --> 31:36.590
and try to drive out of here,
if you're outside

31:36.790 --> 31:38.470
- when the sun goes down--
- Know what? I'm done.

31:38.670 --> 31:39.900
- Excuse me. Excuse me!
- No. Please.

31:40.100 --> 31:40.990
Seriously.

31:41.190 --> 31:42.950
You can't go back
on that bus.

31:43.150 --> 31:44.470
Get out of my way.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.030
I can't do that.

31:48.250 --> 31:50.250
[Jim grunts]
There's something.

31:52.430 --> 31:54.220
There's something, uh...

31:54.420 --> 31:56.400
there's a chamber
or something underneath.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.000
- Let's lift this thing. Ready?
- Yeah. One, two--

32:00.780 --> 32:02.530
[Tom] Oh, whoa!

32:02.730 --> 32:04.090
Elgin, you okay?

32:05.480 --> 32:07.150
Uh, I was just
a little dizzy.

32:07.350 --> 32:08.930
Okay. You wanna go inside?

32:09.130 --> 32:10.100
We'll try and get you
some water.

32:11.230 --> 32:12.270
I can help you.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.320
Nice and slow.

32:17.370 --> 32:19.330
- You okay?
- Ooh. Whoa, whoa.

32:19.530 --> 32:21.900
Are you okay?
Shit. Shit.

32:22.100 --> 32:23.900
- Elgin?
- [grunting]

32:24.100 --> 32:25.420
I need some help
over here!

32:26.720 --> 32:28.300
Places don't just come apart
like this.

32:28.500 --> 32:30.910
- Jim?
- Uh, wait. We're almost there.

32:31.110 --> 32:32.480
[woman] Hey. Help me. Help me.

32:32.680 --> 32:34.000
- What happened?
- I don't know.

32:34.200 --> 32:35.390
- He just started seizing.
- Okay. Easy, easy.

32:35.590 --> 32:36.470
Elgin, I'm gonna put this
under your head.

32:38.650 --> 32:40.050
Aw, fuck!

32:40.250 --> 32:41.350
I need you to help me
roll him on his side.

32:41.550 --> 32:43.100
One, two, three.

32:43.300 --> 32:45.450
He was sick on the bus.
Stay with me, Elgin.

32:45.650 --> 32:46.970
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

32:47.170 --> 32:48.930
You gotta get out of there, man.
Come on, Jim.

32:49.130 --> 32:50.490
This is the beam
that I gotta get out.

32:50.690 --> 32:53.150
[loud crashing]

32:53.350 --> 32:55.500
Hey, you're okay.
Keep breathing.

32:55.700 --> 32:57.540
- There you go. Good.
- [house frame creaks]

32:57.740 --> 32:59.550
Let's go! Let's go.

32:59.750 --> 33:01.640
Let's go!

33:01.840 --> 33:03.320
- Jim!
- I'm not leaving.

33:10.550 --> 33:13.640
[men yelling]

33:23.300 --> 33:25.390
- Dad!
- Julie!

33:26.700 --> 33:28.400
- Dad!
- Julie, no. Be careful. Stop.

33:28.600 --> 33:29.620
- [Kenny] Wait!
- Dad, can you hear me?

33:29.820 --> 33:31.190
[Donna] Jim!

33:31.390 --> 33:34.220
[tinnitus ringing]

33:39.270 --> 33:40.980
- [Julie] Dad?
- [Donna] Jim?

33:41.180 --> 33:42.500
Dad, are you down there?

33:42.700 --> 33:43.720
[Ellis]
If anyone else is down there--

33:43.920 --> 33:46.380
- [Julie] Dad!
- [Donna] Jim?

33:46.580 --> 33:48.730
- Dad! Dad, can you hear me?
- [ringing stops]

33:48.930 --> 33:51.030
- [groans]
- Dad?

33:51.230 --> 33:54.600
[Donna] Jim, can you hear me?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.430
- [structure groans]
- Hello? Dad, Dad?

33:56.630 --> 33:59.480
- [Donna] Jim.
- Dad, just hang on, okay?

33:59.680 --> 34:02.000
Dad, if you can hear us,
just please hang on.

34:02.200 --> 34:04.260
[grunts]

34:04.460 --> 34:06.470
- Dad, are you there?
- Just hang on, okay?

34:07.610 --> 34:11.010
Dad?
Dad, talk to me, please.

34:11.210 --> 34:13.140
- Dad, Dad!
- Julie.

34:13.340 --> 34:15.320
- Julie?
- Dad, can you hear me?

34:15.520 --> 34:16.750
Julie?

34:16.950 --> 34:18.190
- Dad!
- Julie?

34:18.390 --> 34:19.500
[Kenny]
Over there.

34:19.700 --> 34:21.450
- Dad, I'm here.
- [Jim] Julie?

34:21.650 --> 34:23.760
Jim, we're gonna get you out
of there, alright?

34:23.960 --> 34:25.760
Is there anyone else
down there with you?

34:25.960 --> 34:27.290
You guys better hurry.

34:27.490 --> 34:28.680
- Over there.
- Tom!

34:28.880 --> 34:29.720
Dad, it's okay.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.200
Tom, is there anyone
with you?

34:31.400 --> 34:32.280
[Kenny] Hey, hey. Careful.
Careful with that.

34:36.770 --> 34:40.250
The kid with the jacket,
he's not moving.

34:42.420 --> 34:43.420
[Donna] Is he breathing?

34:45.510 --> 34:46.700
I can't tell.

34:46.900 --> 34:49.050
Dad, listen to me, okay?
We're gonna get you out.

34:49.250 --> 34:50.310
- We just, uh--
- Be careful when you get--

34:50.510 --> 34:52.140
[exhales sharply]

34:52.340 --> 34:54.790
I want you to stay
