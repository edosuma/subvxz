I tell you.

Don't you say that.

In a couple of weeks,

And as we all know, this year
isn't gonna be anything

15:44.244 --> 15:46.581

16:35.128 --> 16:36.063
-Yeah.

16:38.465 --> 16:41.034
You might wanna wipe
that smirk off your face.

16:41.068 --> 16:41.970
-What the fuck?

16:42.002 --> 16:44.371
-You and Riley won't be working
together.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.574
-Come on. Why, Cap?

16:46.608 --> 16:48.408
-Because you, Officer Coughlin,

16:48.442 --> 16:52.079
and you, Officer Jefferson,
will be reassigned to Southie.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.480
Jefferson, you will be
on the bus with the kids.

16:53.515 --> 16:55.750
Coughlin, you will escort
those kids into Southie High.

16:55.783 --> 16:57.484
-What? Cap, why?

16:57.519 --> 16:59.286
I like it here.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.355
-Because higher-ups told me to
pick two men

17:01.388 --> 17:04.091
that I thought could relate
to the poor people

17:04.124 --> 17:06.226
that are affected
by this whole fiasco.

17:06.260 --> 17:07.327
-Why don't they
leave good alone?

17:07.361 --> 17:08.161
-No offense, Jefferson,

17:08.195 --> 17:09.263
but mixing the Black
and white kids

17:09.296 --> 17:12.232
from the poorest neighborhoods
is not a good idea.

17:12.266 --> 17:13.701
-No, I get it.

17:13.735 --> 17:15.570
All I'm saying is it's going
to be tough for everybody.

17:17.839 --> 17:22.376
-Cap, my neighbors
will turn against me.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.211
-Hm.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.380
Remember five minutes ago

17:26.413 --> 17:31.719
when I said let's keep
our feelings out of this?

17:31.753 --> 17:33.655
Let's keep our feelings
out this.

17:33.688 --> 17:36.624
And your new partner
Jefferson is right. Huh?

17:36.658 --> 17:39.293
This isn't going to be easy.
We all know that.

17:39.326 --> 17:41.428
But I picked the two of you
because, well, Jefferson,

17:41.461 --> 17:42.429
you're Black.

17:42.462 --> 17:43.430
-He's Black?

17:43.463 --> 17:46.233
-Yeah, he's Black.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.703
And these kids need somebody
that they can identify with.

17:48.736 --> 17:50.170
-Mm-hm.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.506
-And I picked you, Coughlin,

17:51.539 --> 17:53.708
because you're from
the neighborhood.

17:53.741 --> 17:55.877
And I'm hoping that maybe
you can talk some sense

17:55.910 --> 17:58.513
into your neighbors off hours.

17:58.546 --> 18:01.148
Besides, all these kids,
the kids on the bus,

18:01.181 --> 18:02.850
they know you from Roxbury.

18:02.884 --> 18:03.885
Huh?

18:03.918 --> 18:06.286
You got a good rep.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.188
-Are you fucking
kidding me? I'm fucked.

18:08.221 --> 18:12.492
I might as well paint my face
black walking with those kids.

18:12.527 --> 18:13.460
No offense, Jefferson.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.830
-No. None taken.

18:15.863 --> 18:17.130
-You come back after your shift

18:17.164 --> 18:18.600
and I'll paint your face black
for you.

18:18.633 --> 18:21.134
Otherwise,
you fucking figure it out,

18:21.168 --> 18:21.836
because your name's in it.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.740

this city apart.

18:31.679 --> 18:33.213
Don't be racist.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.582

18:34.616 --> 18:37.284

Yeah. What's the verdict on him?

-Hm?
-What's the verdict on him?

They hate us.

21:23.751 --> 21:25.520
-Hey, you're right.

They're gonna call you
every name possible.

ain't no better

21:30.625 --> 21:33.828

But there is nothing
that you can't handle.

21:38.498 --> 21:41.002
And what have we
learned about hate?

21:41.035 --> 21:42.937
-That it's like
an addictive drug,

21:42.970 --> 21:45.438
because people who hate
have low self-esteem,

21:45.472 --> 21:46.339
and putting others down

21:46.373 --> 21:49.376
makes them feel better
about themselves.

21:49.409 --> 21:52.613
-And what does
the Bible teach us

21:52.647 --> 21:54.949
about how to deal
with those that hate us?

21:54.982 --> 21:55.950
-We should pray for them.

21:57.652 --> 21:59.386
-Good.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.956
And how do we overcome hate?

22:28.182 --> 22:30.618
Oh, my god. Yes.

22:30.651 --> 22:35.455
[chuckles] I'm so happy.

22:35.488 --> 22:36.757
I can stay.

22:36.791 --> 22:37.725
-Kate.

22:40.460 --> 22:43.998
it's going to be different
with Black kids there.

22:44.031 --> 22:44.999
-Mm.

22:53.507 --> 22:56.577
Why do niggas have to
go to our school anyways?

22:56.611 --> 22:58.512
-Kate. Don't use
that language in this house.

22:58.546 --> 22:59.513
You know better.

22:59.547 --> 23:01.749
-Or what?

23:01.782 --> 23:03.416
What? Like
we're not from Southie

23:03.450 --> 23:05.586
where the word isn't thrown
around like confetti anyways.

23:05.620 --> 23:07.487
-Change that tone.

23:07.521 --> 23:09.690
And don't tell me what people
are saying in the streets.

23:09.724 --> 23:11.759
I worry about my own home.

23:11.792 --> 23:17.865
-I know. It's just--it's not
fair, you know?

23:17.899 --> 23:20.835
The Blacks coming to our school,
causing problems.

23:20.868 --> 23:23.604
It's just gonna ruin
our senior year.

23:26.807 --> 23:28.910
-I understand.

23:28.943 --> 23:30.678
It's okay to be angry.

23:31.979 --> 23:34.148
But don't take it out on others.

23:34.181 --> 23:36.449
Calling people names
or acting out

23:36.483 --> 23:40.888
will make the situation worse.
Hm?

23:40.922 --> 23:43.658
We have to be good Catholics
and love our neighbors

23:43.691 --> 23:44.926
as we love ourselves.

23:44.959 --> 23:46.193
-Yeah, but they're not
our neighbors.

23:46.227 --> 23:47.528
That's the problem.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.068
I'm gonna call Cheryl.

This isn't fair.
I'm not going to Roxbury High.

24:25.666 --> 24:26.968
I'll be the only
white kid in there.

24:27.001 --> 24:28.602
-What you want me to do?

24:28.636 --> 24:29.537
-I don't know,
call somebody.

24:29.570 --> 24:31.105
You know people.

24:31.138 --> 24:34.175
-If any of those
coons put a hand on you

24:34.208 --> 24:36.844
so help me God, I'll kill 'em.

24:36.877 --> 24:38.079
I'll kill 'em all.

24:38.112 --> 24:39.914
-I thought
we could pick her school.

24:39.947 --> 24:41.048
It's her senior year.

24:41.082 --> 24:43.117
-I don't know
and I don't give a shit.

Those spearchuckers

Oh, we gotta do something.
We have to.

25:36.904 --> 25:39.607

Huh?

28:50.998 --> 28:54.001
We used to run wild through
the streets of Southie.

Nothing came between us.

28:55.269 --> 28:56.403
-You remember Mister Kelley?

Well, I knew then
that we were nothing alike.

fucking kidding me?

the violence.

Yeah, but you know in Southie,
we make our own laws.

29:29.203 --> 29:30.337
and we protect our own.

that she didn't tell you.

tell you that, huh?

ten words of English.

33:26.173 --> 33:28.442
I got bullied because
I had a funny accent.

33:33.247 --> 33:36.684
Johnny was the first kid
who was nice to me.

33:36.718 --> 33:40.522
But as soon as I found out
how bad he was, I ran away.

33:41.789 --> 33:44.424
I never mentioned it
'cause it was nothing.

33:44.458 --> 33:47.595
Hm? I love you.

33:53.668 --> 33:56.838
[engine roaring in distance]

33:56.871 --> 33:58.438
-Where's Kate?

33:58.472 --> 34:00.708
-In her room.

34:00.742 --> 34:02.476
I don't like how you're acting.

34:02.510 --> 34:04.077
-What's the name
of that kid who likes Kate?

34:05.445 --> 34:06.480
-Marty?

34:09.316 --> 34:11.318
You-Ah, just give me a minute.

34:11.351 --> 34:13.788
Kate!

34:13.821 --> 34:15.289
Kate!
-Yeah?

34:15.322 --> 34:18.292
-Get down here, now!

34:18.325 --> 34:19.493
-Bill, are you gonna
keep me in the dark

34:19.527 --> 34:21.328
or let me know
what the hell is going on?

34:21.361 --> 34:24.298
[footsteps approaching]

34:25.365 --> 34:27.602
-Yeah?

34:27.635 --> 34:31.539
-Ah, John Bunkley,
are you and him in any kind of,

34:31.573 --> 34:33.240
you know?

34:33.273 --> 34:36.243
-[scoffs] What--what
are you talking about?

34:36.276 --> 34:37.512
-Answer the question.
-No!

34:37.545 --> 34:40.147
-Don't play stupid.
-No!

34:40.180 --> 34:43.383
-Stay away from him.
You hear me? I mean it.

34:43.417 --> 34:45.485
-Okay.
Mom, what's going on?

34:45.520 --> 34:46.588
-I don't know.

34:46.621 --> 34:47.755
Your dad came home
acting strange.

34:50.457 --> 34:52.125
-Go to your room.
Let me talk to your mother.

34:53.360 --> 34:54.629
-Dad, you okay?

34:54.662 --> 34:55.630
-Yeah, I'm fine. Are you?

34:57.197 --> 34:58.198
Go!

34:58.231 --> 35:01.301
[footsteps receding]

35:04.706 --> 35:06.741
[approaching footsteps]

35:06.774 --> 35:08.275
[Bill sighs]

35:10.344 --> 35:12.680
Your mom told me
the good and bad news.

35:16.718 --> 35:18.720
It's tough not having
your partner.

35:20.822 --> 35:22.389
I had the same issue today.

35:23.925 --> 35:25.125
-Really, what happened?

35:32.767 --> 35:34.368
-They moved me to Southie.

35:36.871 --> 35:39.272
I'll be escorting the Black kids
into the school.

35:43.778 --> 35:45.513
-Oh my god, it keeps
getting worse and worse.

35:45.546 --> 35:47.280
You're gonna be with.

35:47.314 --> 35:52.520
You're gonna be with me
on my senior year at Southie?

35:52.553 --> 35:54.354
-Come on.
Is it that bad?

35:54.388 --> 36:00.628
-Yeah! Yeah, it is!
Everything is going wrong.

36:00.662 --> 36:04.532
-Look, kid, they forced
this bussing thing

36:04.565 --> 36:05.399
down our throats.

36:05.432 --> 36:06.501
It's not fair, I know.
-Yeah, I know.

36:06.534 --> 36:08.468
I told Mom that and she got
all bent out of shape.

36:08.503 --> 36:09.937
-Well, you said
a little more than that.

36:09.971 --> 36:12.540
-I'm just saying what
everybody else has been saying.

36:12.573 --> 36:14.842
If I call them Black or nigger,
it's not--it's not me.

36:14.876 --> 36:17.310
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Stop, okay?

36:17.344 --> 36:19.514
Your mother doesn't allow
that language in this house.

36:19.547 --> 36:21.415
-Okay, I'm sorry, Dad.
But I'm--

36:21.448 --> 36:23.283
-No buts, okay?

36:23.316 --> 36:25.753
Don't say that word.

36:25.787 --> 36:27.421
Where'd you learn to say
things like that?

36:27.454 --> 36:28.556
-Um.

36:29.724 --> 36:33.226
you and your friends?

36:33.260 --> 36:35.930
And practically everybody
in the neighborhood.

36:35.963 --> 36:39.634
-[inhales deeply]

36:39.667 --> 36:42.402
Listen, if I tolerated
that word, it was wrong.

36:42.436 --> 36:45.305
Okay, I understand
you're disappointed

36:45.338 --> 36:46.774
but that doesn't give
you or me the right

36:46.808 --> 36:48.710
to call Black people names,
or anyone.

36:48.743 --> 36:50.377
-Hm.

36:50.410 --> 36:52.312
-Okay?

36:52.345 --> 36:53.447
Look at me.

36:55.482 --> 36:59.453
[chuckles] Okay?

36:59.486 --> 37:04.257
-All I want is
a normal senior year.

37:04.291 --> 37:05.960
What is wrong with that?

37:05.993 --> 37:07.595
-Nothing. If I could do
something about it, I would.

37:07.628 --> 37:09.329
-Yeah, but we can't.

37:09.362 --> 37:11.264
The only thing we can do is keep
them from coming to my school.

37:11.298 --> 37:15.570
-Don't get sucked up into
all the neighborhood nonsense.

37:15.603 --> 37:16.604
It's poison.

37:19.507 --> 37:20.508
You hear me?

37:21.609 --> 37:22.610
I mean it.

37:22.643 --> 37:24.011
-Mm.

37:24.045 --> 37:26.514
-And why is Johnny
talking about you and his son?

37:28.482 --> 37:29.784
-That's not what you think.

37:33.420 --> 37:34.354
-Huh.

37:35.623 --> 37:37.390
What do I think?

37:37.424 --> 37:38.391
Huh? You know my thoughts now?

37:38.425 --> 37:40.561
You gonna tell me what I think?
-Don't get mad.

37:40.595 --> 37:41.629
-Do I look mad?

37:41.662 --> 37:42.964
I'm perfectly calm.
-Yeah, okay.

37:42.997 --> 37:46.299
Do you know that, uh,
job that Cheryl's got

37:46.333 --> 37:47.668
at McLaughlin's office
right now?

37:51.973 --> 37:55.977
Sometimes I just.I just
go there to hang out.

37:56.010 --> 37:57.879
-What?
You shittin' me, right?

37:57.912 --> 37:59.747
Fuck!
-Bill, stop cursing.

37:59.781 --> 38:01.783
-Pat!
Patty, get up here now.

38:01.816 --> 38:03.551
How many times have
I told you not to hang out

38:03.584 --> 38:04.986
with those people?

38:05.019 --> 38:07.555
You see them,
you say hi and bye.

38:07.588 --> 38:08.656
That's it.

38:08.689 --> 38:09.757
-What's the matter?

38:09.791 --> 38:10.925
-Tell your mother.

38:10.958 --> 38:12.627
-What is it, Kate?

38:12.660 --> 38:14.762
-She's been hanging
around McLaughlin's place.

38:17.965 --> 38:20.433
-That explains why she's
using that kind of language.

38:20.467 --> 38:25.039
-You know what?
Both of you are hypocrites.

38:25.072 --> 38:26.073
What? You think
you're better than them?

38:26.107 --> 38:27.708
You're not.

38:27.742 --> 38:29.610
I've heard all the stories
about you growing up, Dad.

38:29.644 --> 38:32.613
So don't tell me
about those people.

38:32.647 --> 38:35.683
Don't tell me about those people
because you are those people!

38:35.716 --> 38:36.951
You are!

38:36.984 --> 38:38.485
-Watch how you talk
to your father.

38:38.519 --> 38:40.822
-I have to take a walk,

38:40.855 --> 38:43.858
or I'm gonna say
somethin' I regret.

38:43.891 --> 38:45.092
-I think we all
need a moment.

38:45.126 --> 38:47.695
[receding footsteps]

38:47.728 --> 38:50.631
You need to think
about the company you keep.

38:53.601 --> 38:54.836
-[Kate groans]

38:58.405 --> 38:59.674
[whispers] I hate them.

39:01.943 --> 39:04.111
[dog barking in distance]

39:04.145 --> 39:06.714
[birds chirping]

39:06.747 --> 39:08.381
-Cannot believe
they are shipping me to Southie.

39:11.752 --> 39:15.990
If any of those crackers mess
with me, I'm missing them up.

39:16.023 --> 39:17.859
-Well, you can't go in there
with that kind of attitude.

39:17.892 --> 39:19.660
-To hell with that.

39:19.694 --> 39:21.896
I don't wanna go
to their damn school.

39:21.929 --> 39:23.631
I don't.

39:23.664 --> 39:25.666
[dog barking in distance]

39:25.700 --> 39:27.902
I'm perfect right here.

39:27.935 --> 39:30.403
But no, they want a bunch
of kids who hate each other

39:30.437 --> 39:33.774
to walk hand in hand
and sing Kumbaya.

39:33.808 --> 39:35.475
Politicians are dumb.

39:35.509 --> 39:37.845
-I don't want to go either,
my dad's making me.

39:37.879 --> 39:40.014
But I'm not gonna go
with the attitude of

39:40.047 --> 39:44.619
a Black Panther or Malcolm X,
but a little Martin Luther King.

39:44.652 --> 39:46.687
-Psh. Shut up.

39:46.721 --> 39:48.089
And where's King?

39:48.122 --> 39:49.824
Dead.

39:49.857 --> 39:51.424
Murdered by a cracker.

39:51.458 --> 39:53.828
-Don't tell me to shut up!

39:53.861 --> 39:55.997
And Malcolm was murdered
by a Black man.

39:56.030 --> 39:58.165
Now is one murder
less serious than the other

39:58.199 --> 40:01.769
because of the color
of the person who did it?

40:01.802 --> 40:02.870
-You're always tryin'
to find the good

40:02.904 --> 40:03.838
in something bad.

40:05.472 --> 40:06.439
but ain't no good in this.

40:10.811 --> 40:12.179
I'm messing me up a white boy
if they screw with me!

40:12.213 --> 40:14.515
That's all.

40:14.548 --> 40:16.584
-If you go into that school
looking for trouble,

40:16.617 --> 40:17.652
you're gonna find it.

40:20.721 --> 40:21.656
-It found me.

40:23.791 --> 40:25.458
I'm just getting ready
for a war.

40:29.230 --> 40:32.133
[birds chirping]

40:34.001 --> 40:36.837
[birds squawking]

40:36.871 --> 40:39.640
[boat blaring]

40:39.674 --> 40:41.642
-So.

40:41.676 --> 40:43.044
you and Marty.

40:43.077 --> 40:44.578
-Me and Marty.

40:44.612 --> 40:45.880
-You got nothin', right?

40:45.913 --> 40:46.847
I mean, he didn't ask you
to go steady or anything?

40:46.881 --> 40:48.616
-No. He's too scared.

40:50.885 --> 40:52.485
-Oh, okay.

40:52.520 --> 40:55.790
Well, from this point on,
you're John Bunkley's girl.

40:55.823 --> 40:58.693
I'll make sure
and tell Marty that.

40:58.726 --> 41:02.630
-I'll tell him but
I didn't say yes to you yet.

41:02.663 --> 41:03.764
Did you think about that?

41:03.798 --> 41:07.034
-What, I couldn't hear you. Say
it a little louder.

41:07.068 --> 41:09.503
-I didn't say yes to you.

41:09.537 --> 41:10.470
-Well.

41:21.916 --> 41:24.618
[boat blaring]

41:24.652 --> 41:27.722
[birds squawking]

41:35.129 --> 41:38.299
-My father's gonna kill us
when he finds out.

41:38.332 --> 41:40.534
-Hey, don't worry
about your father.

41:41.602 --> 41:43.838
Okay?

41:43.871 --> 41:46.607
He and my old man,
they go way back.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.542
They'll figure it out.

41:48.576 --> 41:51.979
If not, we'll run away

41:52.013 --> 41:55.116
and, uh, we'll be
the new Bonnie and Clyde.

41:55.149 --> 41:58.819
-Bonnie and Clyde.
Robbing banks and armored cars.

42:01.288 --> 42:03.024
-Can I tell you something?

42:03.057 --> 42:03.991
-Tell me something.

42:04.025 --> 42:06.927
[boat blaring]

42:06.961 --> 42:08.896
-You want to know why
my old man went to prison?

42:12.800 --> 42:14.235
Everybody thinks it's because
he killed that coon

42:14.268 --> 42:16.771
for Mister McLaughlin,

42:16.804 --> 42:19.774
which I guess that is kind of
true, but what nobody knows

42:19.807 --> 42:22.176
is that the coon my old man
killed, he--

42:22.209 --> 42:23.310
-You don't have to
tell me this, John.

42:23.344 --> 42:25.846
I, um--it's all right.

42:25.880 --> 42:27.948
-Just listen to me.
I'm gonna tell you.

42:27.982 --> 42:31.919
Um, the coon my old man killed,
he ran away with my mom.

42:36.624 --> 42:40.628
Yeah, the spade used to sell
dope for Mister McLaughlin.

42:40.661 --> 42:42.163
My old man would collect
money from him

42:42.196 --> 42:46.067
and my mom would just
go with him sometimes.

42:46.100 --> 42:47.868
One day, my old man
went to collect

42:47.902 --> 42:49.970
and the coon and my mom
were stoned out of their minds

42:50.004 --> 42:53.374
and half naked,
just laying there.

42:53.407 --> 42:57.144
So my old man lost it
and beat that coon to death.

42:57.178 --> 42:59.180
And my ma ran away.

43:01.882 --> 43:02.817
I'm sorry.

43:06.053 --> 43:07.121
I brought you something.

43:09.156 --> 43:10.057
I brought, uh.

43:11.992 --> 43:13.094
this picture.

43:15.663 --> 43:19.066
[chuckles]
so you can meet my mom.

43:19.100 --> 43:21.068
How I remember her, at least.

43:25.172 --> 43:28.109
[♪♪♪]

43:28.142 --> 43:29.677
When my old man told me
what happened,

43:29.710 --> 43:32.713
he made me promise
not to tell anyone.

43:32.746 --> 43:35.182
So you're the only one
that knows the whole story.

43:35.216 --> 43:37.151
-I'm not gonna tell
anyone the whole story.

43:38.986 --> 43:41.155
-I want you to
keep that picture, too.

43:41.188 --> 43:42.389
-John, you sure?

43:42.423 --> 43:44.091
-Mm-hm.

43:44.125 --> 43:45.960
You'll always have
my family with you.

43:45.993 --> 43:49.196
[birds squawking]

43:52.099 --> 43:53.033
-Okay.

43:54.335 --> 43:55.736
-Hey.

43:55.769 --> 43:56.871
-Hi, Marty. What's up?

43:56.904 --> 43:58.172
-What's up?

43:58.205 --> 44:00.040
Where's Kate?

44:00.074 --> 44:01.075
-Ah, she took a walk.

44:02.943 --> 44:03.944
-Without you?

44:03.978 --> 44:04.945
-Yeah, she'll be right back.

44:09.450 --> 44:11.018
Marty, let's talk.

44:11.051 --> 44:12.853
Hey.

44:12.887 --> 44:15.222
-You know something, don't you?

44:15.256 --> 44:16.857
-Why didn't you ask Kate
to go out with you?

44:16.891 --> 44:19.059
-Why do you think
I got this sweat box on?

44:19.093 --> 44:22.263
That was my plan today.
I was gonna give her my jacket.

44:22.296 --> 44:23.697
[scoffs] What's the matter?

44:25.266 --> 44:26.867
-Marty, she's going out
with John now.

44:30.804 --> 44:32.106
-Is she with him now?

44:32.139 --> 44:33.073
-Yeah.

44:35.109 --> 44:36.177
-They know?

44:36.210 --> 44:37.411

56:36.197 --> 56:38.566
I don't even know
how she did it, you know.

56:40.635 --> 56:43.571
Even when she was
facing the cancer,

56:43.604 --> 56:49.476
she never, never cried once.

56:49.510 --> 56:51.012
You know, I cried all the time.

56:53.047 --> 56:54.882
[sighs]

56:54.916 --> 56:57.952
And if she saw some injustice,
she just,

56:57.985 --> 57:00.588
she'd jump right into action,

57:00.621 --> 57:01.923
regardless of the danger.

57:04.926 --> 57:06.661
I called her on it once or twice

57:06.694 --> 57:09.196
and she'd just throw
her famous Gandhi quote.

57:09.230 --> 57:12.133
She said, "You got to do
the right thing.

57:15.169 --> 57:17.905
You never know what's
gonna be the results.

57:17.939 --> 57:22.677
But if you do nothing,
there will be no results."

57:24.946 --> 57:26.647
-Gandhi never had to
drive through Southie.

57:32.753 --> 57:35.656
-I've made a decision.

57:35.690 --> 57:37.224
Your mama wouldn't
approve of it,

57:37.258 --> 57:41.762
but I'm not gonna make
you go to that school.

57:41.796 --> 57:44.598
It's. it's too dangerous.

57:48.135 --> 57:49.203
[sliding door rattles]

57:49.236 --> 57:51.572
-What the fuck?

57:51.605 --> 57:52.840
[chuckles]

57:52.873 --> 57:54.909
I thought you left.
Go rent a room.

57:54.942 --> 57:57.845
Come on. Look what we got here.

57:57.878 --> 57:59.046
-Hey, John, come on.

57:59.080 --> 58:00.982
You don't bring
young ladies up here.

58:01.015 --> 58:02.883
Especially not Kate,
do you hear me?

58:02.917 --> 58:04.151
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

58:05.653 --> 58:06.654
Good work, kids.

58:06.687 --> 58:07.621
-He's certainly your son.

58:07.655 --> 58:08.689
-Yeah, he is.

58:08.723 --> 58:10.791
Likes a little
after school work.

58:10.825 --> 58:12.059
-[door slides]
-That's what I'm sayin'.

58:12.093 --> 58:14.061
I don't know what you--
is--is he qualified?

58:14.095 --> 58:15.162
-Yeah.
-To fucking do it?

58:15.196 --> 58:16.163
-Yeah. Yeah. [laughs]

58:16.197 --> 58:17.531
[knocking on window]

58:17.565 --> 58:18.866
-Who's--who's this?

58:18.899 --> 58:19.734
[banging on window]

58:19.767 --> 58:21.168
-McLaughlin,
I know you're in there.

58:21.202 --> 58:22.236
-All right, man.

58:22.269 --> 58:23.204
-You see what I'm talking about?
-Kate!

58:23.237 --> 58:24.739
-Hold on.
I'm fucking coming.

58:25.840 --> 58:28.576
-Huh? Kate! Kate!

58:28.609 --> 58:30.644
Where is she?
Where's my daughter?

58:30.678 --> 58:31.579
-She ain't here.
-Calm down, Billy.

58:31.612 --> 58:32.980
-Ya fuckin' prick.

58:33.014 --> 58:34.548
-Calm down.

58:34.582 --> 58:35.516
-What do you think we are?

58:35.549 --> 58:37.618
A bunch of fucking tree jumpers?
Look around!

58:37.651 --> 58:39.120
Is this a place
for a teenage girl?

58:39.153 --> 58:40.921
-Okay, you're right.
I apologize.

58:40.955 --> 58:42.656
-Yeah, you damn right
I'm right.

58:42.690 --> 58:44.258
We got a bunch of
morals and codes

58:44.291 --> 58:46.127
that we don't fucking break.

58:46.160 --> 58:47.828
Don't disrespect us
like that again.

58:47.862 --> 58:49.563
One more time,
and like that fucking ball

58:49.597 --> 58:50.598
-Ooh.

58:50.631 --> 58:51.699
-I just swung at,

58:51.732 --> 58:53.067
you won't fucking exist.

58:53.100 --> 58:54.902
-Hey, hold on. Hold on.

58:54.935 --> 58:57.738
If Kate's missing,
maybe we can help.

58:57.772 --> 58:59.073
-I don't need
your kind of help.

58:59.106 --> 59:00.808
-Oh, be nice, Billy.

59:00.841 --> 59:01.809
-Yeah.
-[phone ringing]

59:03.744 --> 59:05.846
-[into phone] Yeah? Yeah, sure.

59:05.880 --> 59:08.215
Billy, you got a call.

59:08.249 --> 59:09.216
-Here we go.

59:12.319 --> 59:13.888
-We work for you now apparently.

59:17.058 --> 59:17.992
-There you go.

59:20.294 --> 59:23.264
-[into phone] Hello. Yeah.

59:23.297 --> 59:24.231
Okay.

59:25.866 --> 59:27.068
[phone thuds]

59:30.237 --> 59:31.939
Kate's home.

59:31.972 --> 59:34.708
-Uh, Billy, then.

59:34.742 --> 59:39.847
-Billy, don't you ever come in
here like that again.

59:47.388 --> 59:49.356
-[laughs] Nice job.

59:49.390 --> 59:52.193
[door opens then closes]

59:53.661 --> 59:54.829
-When did you start
sneaking out of the house?

59:54.862 --> 59:57.698
-Mom, I just wanted
to go and hang out--

59:57.731 --> 1:00:00.768
-Marty? He asked to go
steady, didn't he?

1:00:03.404 --> 1:00:04.705
-Yeah.

1:00:04.738 --> 1:00:06.974
-[Pat chuckles]

1:00:07.007 --> 1:00:08.809
-Marty.

1:00:08.843 --> 1:00:13.147
I just. I didn't know
how you guys were gonna react.

1:00:13.180 --> 1:00:15.149
-Yes, I knew it.

1:00:15.182 --> 1:00:16.884
You know how relieved
your Dad is gonna be

1:00:16.917 --> 1:00:17.852
when he finds out
-[Kate chuckles]

1:00:17.885 --> 1:00:19.019
that you're dating Marty?

1:00:21.822 --> 1:00:23.324
When you came
in the house earlier,

1:00:23.357 --> 1:00:25.893
I knew something special
happened in your life.

1:00:25.926 --> 1:00:26.827
-Really? How?

1:00:28.262 --> 1:00:32.800
-Your smile,
and a mother's intuition.

1:00:32.833 --> 1:00:34.235
We just know these things.

1:00:34.268 --> 1:00:36.904
-Yeah.

1:00:36.937 --> 1:00:39.006
-I told your dad.

1:00:39.039 --> 1:00:43.210
-Oh. What did he say?

1:00:43.244 --> 1:00:45.212
-Marty is a good kid.

1:00:45.246 --> 1:00:47.882
-Kate, you better
have an explanation!

1:00:47.915 --> 1:00:49.350
-Calm down.

1:00:49.383 --> 1:00:50.951
-Why is everyone telling me
to calm down all the time?

1:00:50.985 --> 1:00:53.754
I'm calm. Where was she?

1:00:55.389 --> 1:00:56.323
Huh?

1:00:56.357 --> 1:00:59.059
-She sneaked out to go
hang out with Marty.

1:00:59.093 --> 1:01:01.829
-Is that true?

1:01:01.862 --> 1:01:02.930
-Yeah.

1:01:02.963 --> 1:01:03.998
-You weren't with
the Bunkley kid?

1:01:04.031 --> 1:01:05.232
-No!!
-You better not be lying!

1:01:05.266 --> 1:01:07.001
-I'm not--
I'm not lying to you!

1:01:07.034 --> 1:01:08.903
-Okay.

1:01:08.936 --> 1:01:11.172
But I don't like the idea
of not knowing where you're at.

1:01:11.205 --> 1:01:12.973
So next time, I don't give
a damn who you're with,

1:01:13.007 --> 1:01:14.108
just let us know.

1:01:14.141 --> 1:01:15.209
-All right.
-Am I clear?

1:01:15.242 --> 1:01:16.343
-Yeah. Not a problem.

1:01:18.245 --> 1:01:19.780
Can I go to my room now?

1:01:19.813 --> 1:01:20.814
-Go ahead.

1:01:22.249 --> 1:01:23.217
[footsteps receding]

1:01:28.489 --> 1:01:29.423
[door slams]

1:01:32.092 --> 1:01:34.361
-That girl is gonna
drive me to an early grave.

1:01:37.932 --> 1:01:40.367
-I used to sneak out
of the house to meet you.

1:01:40.401 --> 1:01:43.337
[soft music]

1:02:03.290 --> 1:02:04.358
[birds chirping]

1:02:04.391 --> 1:02:06.160
[fridge door closes]

1:02:06.193 --> 1:02:08.162
So, what's on the agenda?

1:02:09.263 --> 1:02:11.465
-Play catch.

1:02:11.498 --> 1:02:15.936
And have the birds
and the bees talk with Dad.

1:02:15.970 --> 1:02:18.138
-I'll let your mom
tell you all about the birds.

1:02:18.172 --> 1:02:21.041
I'm gonna teach you
about the bees. They sting.

1:02:21.075 --> 1:02:22.009
Get your glove.

1:02:25.580 --> 1:02:26.514
Nice.

1:02:29.083 --> 1:02:30.251
Oh, kid. Come on.

1:02:30.284 --> 1:02:31.318
-Relax.

1:02:31.352 --> 1:02:32.419
-Tell me about Marty.

1:02:34.955 --> 1:02:37.224
-What do you mean,
tell me about Marty?

1:02:37.258 --> 1:02:38.459
-Oops, strong arm.

1:02:41.962 --> 1:02:42.997
Why you like him?

1:02:43.030 --> 1:02:44.265
[birds chirping]

1:02:45.966 --> 1:02:47.167
Hey.

1:02:47.201 --> 1:02:48.168
Ball.

1:02:53.307 --> 1:02:54.509
You gonna answer me?

1:02:57.244 --> 1:02:58.379
-He reminds me of you.

1:03:00.314 --> 1:03:02.349
-How you figure?

1:03:02.383 --> 1:03:03.551
That kid is nothing like me.

1:03:08.623 --> 1:03:09.591
I think he's a little soft.

1:03:09.624 --> 1:03:11.526
You know, I'm not--
I was never a soft guy.

1:03:13.961 --> 1:03:15.396
Which is why I like him for you.

1:03:15.429 --> 1:03:17.197
You know, guys like that
don't have the sting

1:03:17.231 --> 1:03:18.299
but they still get the honey.

1:03:21.101 --> 1:03:22.069
You get my drift?

1:03:25.072 --> 1:03:26.140
What's with that look?

1:03:30.344 --> 1:03:31.412
-No, you're right.

1:03:33.147 --> 1:03:34.448
Marty ain't nothing like you.

1:03:40.154 --> 1:03:41.255
[locker door closes]

1:03:45.492 --> 1:03:47.928
-How was it,
workin' the jungle?

1:03:50.598 --> 1:03:52.299
Hey, new guy. Talkin' to you.

1:03:52.333 --> 1:03:56.337
-The name is
Officer Coughlin.

1:03:56.370 --> 1:03:58.939
-Okay, Officer Coughlin.

1:03:58.972 --> 1:04:01.041
Don't bite my head off.

1:04:01.075 --> 1:04:04.144
We're on the same team here.

1:04:04.178 --> 1:04:08.349
I was askin', how was
workin' in the jungle?

1:04:08.382 --> 1:04:10.552
-What are you talking about?

1:04:10.585 --> 1:04:12.319
-Roxbury.

1:04:12.353 --> 1:04:17.324
You know, land of the.
[clicking tongue] Negroes.

1:04:21.295 --> 1:04:23.197
[Bill sighs]

1:04:27.401 --> 1:04:29.571
-It's like anywhere.

1:04:29.604 --> 1:04:32.039
It has its ups and downs.

1:04:32.072 --> 1:04:34.208
-Anyway, we decided
not to come in to work

1:04:34.241 --> 1:04:35.543
on the first day of school.

1:04:35.577 --> 1:04:37.144
-What about the kids?

1:04:37.177 --> 1:04:39.547
-What, the spades?
Fuck 'em!

1:04:39.581 --> 1:04:41.382
-That's fucked up.

1:04:41.415 --> 1:04:43.050
We swore an oath
to serve and protect,

1:04:43.083 --> 1:04:44.552
and you cocksuckers
want to back out

1:04:44.586 --> 1:04:46.120
now that the goin' gets tough?

1:04:46.153 --> 1:04:48.055
-Hey, you don't fuckin'
talk to me like that!

1:04:48.088 --> 1:04:50.424
You don't know me and I don't
think you wanna find out.

1:04:50.457 --> 1:04:52.259
-Listen to me carefully.

1:04:52.292 --> 1:04:54.094
My little girl
is going to school

1:04:54.128 --> 1:04:56.263
and I'll be there to protect her
or anyone else

1:04:56.296 --> 1:04:58.232
who needs my assistance,
so if you assholes

1:04:58.265 --> 1:05:00.000
wanna keep your asshole
kids at home,

1:05:02.604 --> 1:05:03.638
that's your choice.

Don't take another step.

-Billy, it's me.
Put the gun down.

1:05:34.669 --> 1:05:37.371
-McLaughlin!
What the fuck, man?

1:05:37.404 --> 1:05:39.707
Why you following me?
I coulda blown your brains out.

1:05:39.741 --> 1:05:42.176
-[chuckles] Look,
I knew you wouldn't kill me.

1:05:42.209 --> 1:05:44.344
I mean, you haven't
got it in you.

1:05:46.280 --> 1:05:49.483
-I came pretty close.
What do you want?

1:05:51.719 --> 1:05:55.389
-Uh, I hear
you're not cooperating.

1:05:57.424 --> 1:06:00.562
It's this busing thing
that's driving me crazy.

1:06:00.595 --> 1:06:03.063
I-I-I can't sleep.
I don't know how you can.

1:06:04.566 --> 1:06:06.300
-Easy. I just close my eyes.

1:06:09.436 --> 1:06:11.271
-[McLaughlin sighs]

1:06:11.305 --> 1:06:15.008
Look, you and me,

1:06:15.042 --> 1:06:16.109
we go way back.

1:06:17.244 --> 1:06:19.714
I remember you like this.

1:06:19.747 --> 1:06:23.651
Snot pouring out of your nose,
running around in your diapers.

1:06:23.685 --> 1:06:26.019
We're family.

1:06:26.053 --> 1:06:28.388
I protect my family
no matter what,

1:06:28.422 --> 1:06:31.091
and I expect you to do the same.

1:06:32.594 --> 1:06:36.230
Now your fellow officers have
asked you to band with them,

1:06:36.263 --> 1:06:40.768
to protest this injustice,
this--this attack

1:06:40.802 --> 1:06:44.539
on our neighborhood
and our way of life.

1:06:44.572 --> 1:06:48.242
By these people
that--they're not like us.

1:06:48.275 --> 1:06:50.410
They're just not like us.

1:06:50.444 --> 1:06:51.646
You know, these animals,
they're--

1:06:51.679 --> 1:06:53.480
they wanna destroy
our neighborhood.

1:06:53.515 --> 1:06:55.148
Don't you get it?

1:06:55.182 --> 1:06:58.820
Our neighborhood that took
generations to build,

1:06:58.853 --> 1:07:02.790
that's what I'm talking about.

1:07:02.824 --> 1:07:05.492
It means something.

1:07:05.527 --> 1:07:07.060
Don't you fucking understand?

1:07:07.094 --> 1:07:10.698
And what do you say?
All you say is what?

1:19:43.518 --> 1:19:45.052
Because she took too long
talking to the guy

1:19:45.085 --> 1:19:46.053
at the grocery store.

1:19:48.222 --> 1:19:51.559
I had to drag him off of her.

1:19:51.593 --> 1:19:52.560
[scoffs]

1:19:56.430 --> 1:19:58.866
-So John is who
you're really dating?

1:20:00.968 --> 1:20:03.137
-For Christ's sake,
you've been lying to us.

1:20:03.170 --> 1:20:05.507
Why? Huh?
Why you lying to us?

1:20:05.540 --> 1:20:07.007
-What's gotten into you?

1:20:07.041 --> 1:20:07.975
-He's not like his father,

1:20:08.008 --> 1:20:10.044
and I knew you would
never approve of him.

1:20:10.077 --> 1:20:11.178
I knew you would
never approve of him.

1:20:11.211 --> 1:20:12.580
-Let me tell you something.
Let me tell you something

1:20:12.614 --> 1:20:14.481
about Johnny Bunkley, okay?
He's vicious.

1:20:14.516 --> 1:20:17.084
I believe he killed
John's mother.

1:20:17.117 --> 1:20:18.285
-You never told me that.

1:20:18.319 --> 1:20:20.588
-Because I had no proof, okay?

1:20:20.622 --> 1:20:22.624
And some things are
not meant to be talked about

1:20:22.657 --> 1:20:25.259
till crap like this comes up
and secrets come out.

1:20:25.292 --> 1:20:26.628
-Okay, did you
ever think of this?

1:20:26.661 --> 1:20:28.996
Did you ever think
that maybe she deserved it

1:20:29.029 --> 1:20:30.497
for sleeping with a coon?

1:20:30.532 --> 1:20:31.599
[slap thrown]

1:20:31.633 --> 1:20:33.601
-Don't use that language
in my house!

1:20:33.635 --> 1:20:36.370
And how dare you say anyone
deserves to be killed?

1:20:36.403 --> 1:20:37.871
What have you turned into?

1:20:37.905 --> 1:20:39.440
-Okay, this has
gotten out of hand.

1:20:39.473 --> 1:20:41.041
She's not going to school
tomorrow

1:20:41.075 --> 1:20:43.310
till I talk to that kid.
You hear me?

1:20:43.344 --> 1:20:46.080
Stay here.
Don't you leave this house.

use that word again.

1:20:51.653 --> 1:20:54.522
-Thank you.
Thank you, Mom and Dad,

1:20:54.556 --> 1:20:58.225
for the best senior year ever.

1:20:58.258 --> 1:20:59.561
Thank you! [chuckles]

-I'm sorry I hit you.

1:21:23.518 --> 1:21:25.553
But I'm disappointed
in your behavior.

1:21:27.121 --> 1:21:30.290
I love you and I know
you're better than this.

-Not today.

1:22:17.304 --> 1:22:19.106
I don't want the kids thinking
I'm not on their side.

1:22:23.210 --> 1:22:27.481
Remember, that one.

1:22:27.515 --> 1:22:30.050
She's not going to school.

1:22:30.083 --> 1:22:32.286

I got your back though.

Can I tell you something?

Wendy, I. I like you.

not letting me go.

1:24:51.826 --> 1:24:53.260
-How could we trust you?

1:24:54.428 --> 1:24:56.129
Everything you've told us
has been a lie.

1:24:56.163 --> 1:24:57.832
-I know.
I'm really sorry, Mom.

1:24:57.865 --> 1:25:01.536
But you and Dad would have
never approved of John.

1:25:01.569 --> 1:25:04.572
-Could you blame him?

1:25:04.606 --> 1:25:07.174
-Can't judge people
based on their parents.

1:25:07.207 --> 1:25:09.242
You can't.

1:25:09.276 --> 1:25:11.913
-Okay.

1:25:11.946 --> 1:25:14.147
But to say someone
deserves to die,

1:25:14.181 --> 1:25:16.283
that scares the hell out of me.

1:25:16.316 --> 1:25:18.251
And to think my child
could utter those words.

1:25:18.285 --> 1:25:19.921
-No, I know.

1:25:19.954 --> 1:25:22.657
It was a heartless thing
to say and I'm really sorry.

1:25:22.690 --> 1:25:25.459
But, Mom, Daddy isn't even sure.

1:25:25.492 --> 1:25:27.595
Daddy's not sure
that Johnny killed his wife.

1:25:27.629 --> 1:25:29.162
We don't know.

1:25:29.196 --> 1:25:32.332
-Kate, are you listening
to what you're saying?

1:25:32.366 --> 1:25:35.435
The fact that we're even
discussing this is scary.

1:25:35.469 --> 1:25:37.572
Shame on you for hanging
around people like that.

1:25:41.375 --> 1:25:42.877
-I know it was wrong
to lie to you guys.

1:25:44.545 --> 1:25:45.445
I know that,

1:25:47.548 --> 1:25:48.650
and I'm really sorry.

1:25:51.719 --> 1:25:54.522
But how is keeping me
home gonna fix anything?

1:25:55.757 --> 1:25:56.858
We're just gonna look
like the other families,

1:25:56.891 --> 1:25:57.825
keeping their kids home

1:25:57.859 --> 1:25:59.259
because the Black kids
are gonna be there.

1:25:59.292 --> 1:26:01.228
It's wrong.

1:26:01.261 --> 1:26:02.195
Mom,

1:26:04.565 --> 1:26:06.934
you and Daddy are gonna look
like racists when you're not.

1:26:08.136 --> 1:26:10.705
And Daddy was just really mad
and you didn't think of that.

1:26:15.543 --> 1:26:16.544
-Are you trying to con me?

1:26:16.577 --> 1:26:18.278

going to be very mad at me.

commandment to live by.

John thinks you should protest.

I never thought
you would have given up

1:27:54.542 --> 1:27:56.309
the start of your senior year
to be out here.

1:27:56.343 --> 1:27:57.745

There's not gonna be

1:27:57.779 --> 1:27:59.947
a senior year, Marty, okay?

1:27:59.981 --> 1:28:01.549
The Blacks took that from us.

We took that from ourselves.

you tell him

Will you look after her

I want to go and talk to the
doctor just to ask a question.

Why did you have to
come to Southie?

Why couldn't you just
stay in Roxbury?

-I've seen you before.

1:36:36.030 --> 1:36:36.964

No, I don't think so.

1:36:45.507 --> 1:36:47.241
You tried to kill us.

1:36:51.278 --> 1:36:54.081
it's not because
a Black man shot him.

1:36:54.114 --> 1:36:57.451

who pulled the trigger.

I don't even know
how to feel.

1:38:20.702 --> 1:38:23.070
-I'm angry.

1:38:23.103 --> 1:38:26.407
Like you said, I don't
understand-- her parents. I--

1:38:30.678 --> 1:38:32.346
-You know,
your mother used to talk

1:38:32.379 --> 1:38:35.683
to the neighborhood hoodlums.

1:38:35.717 --> 1:38:36.684
And I'd always ask her,

1:38:36.718 --> 1:38:39.353
"Why do you waste your time
talking to them?"

1:38:39.386 --> 1:38:43.525
And she'd say that a bad act
doesn't make a bad person.

1:38:45.627 --> 1:38:46.561
-Ma was special.

1:38:50.164 --> 1:38:51.498
-Yeah, she was.

1:38:53.167 --> 1:38:59.473
And she would be so very,
very proud of you today.

1:38:59.507 --> 1:39:02.376
You put yourself in danger.

1:39:02.409 --> 1:39:06.079
And I don't ever want you
to do that again.

1:39:06.113 --> 1:39:12.486
But, my god, you reminded me
of her so much.

1:39:12.520 --> 1:39:19.359

and I'm very proud of you.
