00:06.920 --> 00:09.120
<i>Previously on Masters of Sex...</i>

00:09.221 --> 00:11.322
The study is back.

00:11.356 --> 00:13.290
Are you signing up?
Please say yes.

00:13.325 --> 00:14.825
Heck yes.

00:14.859 --> 00:16.894
This is your partner
for the evening.

00:16.928 --> 00:20.264
I-I've never not risen...
to the occasion ever.

00:20.298 --> 00:22.166
The reason
I couldn't fuck that woman

00:22.200 --> 00:23.767
is because I was expecting Jane.

00:23.802 --> 00:27.371
Nonperformance is an
equally valuable part of the study.

00:27.405 --> 00:29.506
You're gonna study actual sex?

00:29.541 --> 00:31.075
Eventually.

00:31.109 --> 00:32.610
Queer sex, too?

00:32.644 --> 00:34.345
I met a young man at the brothel.

00:34.379 --> 00:36.814
Uh, a prostitute...
Uh, homosexual.

00:36.848 --> 00:40.417
The men who pay to see him,
they're salesmen or lawyers

00:40.452 --> 00:43.220
or a provost of a major university.

00:43.254 --> 00:45.456
What the hell is this, Bill?

00:45.490 --> 00:47.157
Virginia. Dr. DePaul.

00:47.192 --> 00:50.661
Doctor, if there's anything
I can ever do to help you...

00:50.695 --> 00:52.730
I could use a coffee.

00:54.199 --> 00:55.966
Is that the heartbeat?

00:57.502 --> 00:58.836
Libby...

01:01.039 --> 01:03.307
Just look at me and tell me.

01:03.341 --> 01:04.974
Is this baby gone?

01:05.010 --> 01:06.443
I'm so sorry.

01:06.478 --> 01:08.679
What happened was not your fault.

01:08.713 --> 01:11.382
It wasn't?

01:11.416 --> 01:13.050
So whose fault was it?

01:13.084 --> 01:14.885
You are a powerful man,

01:14.919 --> 01:16.453
but you are not that powerful.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074

01:32.044 --> 01:35.714
A clitoral orgasm is
a purely adolescent phenomenon.

01:35.748 --> 01:39.317
The proper response of mature
women upon reaching puberty

01:39.351 --> 01:42.253
is a natural transfer
of pleasurable feelings

01:42.288 --> 01:46.224
from the clitoris to the vagina
during sexual intercourse.

01:46.258 --> 01:48.893
An inability to achieve orgasm
through intercourse

01:48.928 --> 01:50.962
is an indication
of an arrested development

01:50.996 --> 01:52.330
in a female,

01:52.364 --> 01:56.701
whose sexual frigidity
requires psychiatric treatment.

01:59.839 --> 02:03.007
My father revolutionized
modern thinking

02:03.042 --> 02:05.610
with his views on female sexuality.

02:05.644 --> 02:08.880
But at the end of his life,
he admitted

02:08.913 --> 02:12.951
his understanding of
the female psyche was limited.

02:12.985 --> 02:17.155
If you want to know more
about the nature of femininity,

02:17.189 --> 02:20.592
he said, you will
have to consult the poets.

02:20.626 --> 02:22.060
Which I'm sure

02:22.094 --> 02:26.965
makes all you doctors
sitting here today very nervous.

02:29.969 --> 02:32.203
I will now take questions.

02:35.474 --> 02:37.842
You're making some
of the girls here uncomfortable.

02:37.877 --> 02:39.878
It's okay, Kathleen.

02:39.912 --> 02:43.581
He's just waiting for Jane...
again.

02:43.616 --> 02:46.484
I heard she's not coming in today.

02:46.519 --> 02:49.254
Did she call in sick or, uh...

02:49.288 --> 02:52.724
She did say something
about going to see a doctor.

02:52.758 --> 02:53.892
Virginia took her.

02:53.926 --> 02:55.860
Oh, what was the name...

02:55.895 --> 02:59.430
Dr. Lloyd...maybe or...Dr. Freed?

02:59.465 --> 03:02.534
Yes, Dr. Freud,
Virginia Johnson...

03:02.568 --> 03:03.768
Washington University.

03:03.803 --> 03:06.337
It's a great honor
to hear you speak in person.

03:06.372 --> 03:08.006
Doctor, your father's theory

03:08.040 --> 03:10.809
that the female orgasm
achieved by masturbation

03:10.843 --> 03:13.178
is "immature" compared
to one achieved

03:13.212 --> 03:14.312
through sexual intercourse...

03:14.346 --> 03:16.915
has that ever been
scientifically proven?

03:16.949 --> 03:19.150
I'm not sure I understand
what you're asking.

03:19.185 --> 03:22.687
Has there ever been
any scientific evidence

03:22.721 --> 03:26.224
to substantiate this theory...
any physiological data

03:26.258 --> 03:29.627
t-that differentiates between
the two types of orgasms?

03:29.662 --> 03:32.497
Well, I, for one,

03:32.531 --> 03:36.968
can't imagine how procuring
such data would be possible...

03:37.002 --> 03:39.437
let alone decent.

03:54.253 --> 03:56.221
- Hi.
- Hey.

03:56.255 --> 03:57.255
I hope I'm not barging in.

03:57.289 --> 03:58.489
No.

03:58.524 --> 04:00.859
How... How are you?
How's... How's the baby?

04:00.893 --> 04:03.461
Fine, we're all fine...
Busy bees.

04:03.495 --> 04:05.129
And look at you.

04:05.164 --> 04:08.099
You've done something new
with your hair.

04:08.133 --> 04:10.935
Yes, I had it cut
a few weeks ago.

04:12.171 --> 04:16.741
Um, Bill and I are going out of town
for a few days to Miami.

04:16.774 --> 04:19.277
And I called Silver's
about the milk delivery,

04:19.310 --> 04:21.178
but I didn't want the mail
to pile up.

04:25.651 --> 04:27.151
Don't give the mail another thought.

04:27.186 --> 04:30.722
You just sit by the pool
and drink mai tais.

04:30.756 --> 04:33.458
I'm so jealous.

04:33.492 --> 04:35.927
I'd better go. Thank you.

04:35.961 --> 04:37.762
What are neighbors for?

04:37.796 --> 04:40.531
And you must give me the name
of the girl who does your hair.

04:40.566 --> 04:42.033
You look darling.

04:52.377 --> 04:54.679
Did you get the minutes
from the Obstetrical Society dinner?

04:54.713 --> 04:56.047
Yes.

04:56.081 --> 04:57.715
And the new issue
of Fertility and Sterility?

04:57.750 --> 04:59.884
Oh, and before I forget...
Your I.D.

04:59.919 --> 05:02.954
Now you're impersonating me.

05:02.988 --> 05:05.957
I hope you didn't tarnish
my good name with Anna Freud.

05:05.991 --> 05:07.025
Not at all.

05:07.059 --> 05:08.860
Although, I did leave a bit curious.

05:08.894 --> 05:10.194
So, according to Freud,

05:10.229 --> 05:12.163
there are two types of orgasms,
immature and mature?

05:12.197 --> 05:14.766
Have janitorial
give the place the once over.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.268
There's dust in here
from the Truman administration.

05:17.303 --> 05:20.738
So he's saying that one
orgasm is better than the other?

05:22.341 --> 05:25.343
As I understand it, he's saying
when a woman reaches puberty,

05:25.377 --> 05:27.578
there's a transfer of sexual response

05:27.613 --> 05:29.380
from the clitoris to the vagina.

05:29.415 --> 05:33.918
The external or clitoral orgasm

05:33.953 --> 05:35.987
is the province of adolescent girls.

05:36.021 --> 05:38.189
Mature women experience
sexual response

05:38.223 --> 05:40.191
intravaginally with their husbands.

05:40.225 --> 05:41.659
Otherwise they're frigid.

05:41.694 --> 05:43.728
But who would believe
something like that?

05:43.762 --> 05:45.029
My patients.

05:45.064 --> 05:46.798
That's why we keep the
exam rooms stocked with Kleenex.

05:46.832 --> 05:48.366
A quarter of the women
who walk through my door

05:48.400 --> 05:49.434
tell me they're frigid.

05:49.468 --> 05:52.937
Well, maybe that's because
their husbands can't get the job done.

05:52.972 --> 05:55.239
Does he ever address
the man's role in any of this?

05:55.274 --> 05:57.742
Honestly, all of Freud's theories

05:57.776 --> 05:58.876
have their limits.

05:58.911 --> 06:00.178
I stopped reading him

06:00.212 --> 06:02.847
after my college paper
on the Oedipus complex.

06:02.881 --> 06:05.650
I nearly put my own eyes out.

06:05.684 --> 06:08.052
Oh...Dr. Hill wanted me

06:08.087 --> 06:10.421
to look at his paper
on colonic endometriosis.

06:10.456 --> 06:12.657
It's not exactly beach reading.

06:12.691 --> 06:15.259
Bill, you're not taking
all that stuff to Florida.

06:15.294 --> 06:17.829
That's ridiculous.

06:17.863 --> 06:24.936
I haven't been
on vacation since...1953.

06:24.970 --> 06:29.540
Well,
Libby needs some time away.

06:29.575 --> 06:31.175
And you do, too, Bill.

06:54.466 --> 06:55.666
Hey.

06:55.701 --> 06:57.535
Missed you, stranger.

07:04.476 --> 07:06.344
No.

07:06.378 --> 07:10.481
No? What's your pleasure, then?

07:15.020 --> 07:16.387
I need to know

07:16.422 --> 07:19.257
if you've ever mentioned my name
to anyone...

07:19.291 --> 07:24.028
disclosed the... the nature of our...

07:24.063 --> 07:27.899
relationship.

07:27.933 --> 07:30.768
Are you asking do I kiss and tell?

07:30.803 --> 07:35.106
'Cause if I did, I wouldn't have
any repeat business.

07:35.140 --> 07:41.345
You... you never...
spoke to a sex researcher?

07:41.380 --> 07:44.549
A... A what?

07:44.583 --> 07:46.417
Sex researcher?

07:46.452 --> 07:49.654
Are there people who do that...
They research sex?

07:49.688 --> 07:50.788
I want that job.

07:50.823 --> 07:54.759
I want you to tell me the truth.

07:54.793 --> 08:01.165
Am I the only boy
who's ever shown you a good time?

08:01.200 --> 08:05.703
You didn't strike me as a first-timer
when we got together.

08:05.737 --> 08:09.507
So maybe one of them told somebody.

08:09.541 --> 08:12.376
Look, I wouldn't want to ruin
a good thing.

08:12.411 --> 08:17.381
And...I'm not just saying that
as a businessman.

08:20.219 --> 08:23.454
I like you.

08:23.489 --> 08:26.023
I'm glad to see you again.

08:39.738 --> 08:42.472
I bought you
some athletic socks.

08:42.508 --> 08:44.809
You can't wear argyles
on the beach...

08:44.843 --> 08:47.478
Unless you want to look
like the Duke of Windsor.

08:47.513 --> 08:48.946
Hmm.

08:51.884 --> 08:55.653
I still haven't dared
to try on my bathing suit.

09:02.494 --> 09:06.797
Of course there is a nude beach
near the hotel.

09:06.832 --> 09:10.234
We could leave our suits at home...

09:10.269 --> 09:14.805
Feel the sun glinting
off our naked bodies.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.474
Hmm?

09:16.508 --> 09:20.478
Oh, you're somewhere else.

09:20.512 --> 09:24.532
In an Austrian prison
with Dr. Freud...

09:26.251 --> 09:31.189
"Illusions commend themselves to us
because they save us pain

09:31.223 --> 09:35.660
and allow us
to enjoy pleasure instead."

09:35.694 --> 09:38.796
Not the most rigorous science.

09:38.830 --> 09:42.133
I asked Nancy Lawson
to fetch the mail.

09:43.602 --> 09:46.837
You should have seen the way
that she stared at me...

09:46.872 --> 09:48.139
Like I'm a charity case.

09:48.173 --> 09:51.075
Nancy Lawson is a bore.

09:54.179 --> 09:58.115
They all pretend
like nothing's happened.

09:58.150 --> 10:01.152
But I was pregnant.
They all know it.

10:01.186 --> 10:03.554
No one knows it in Florida.

10:06.358 --> 10:10.361
Better to focus on the future.

10:13.265 --> 10:17.702
I keep thinking about
Christmases when I was a girl.

10:17.736 --> 10:20.671
Before my mother died, we...

10:20.706 --> 10:26.877
we always had a big Douglas fir
and stockings by the fire...

10:28.614 --> 10:30.915
A plate of carrots for the reindeer.

10:34.052 --> 10:37.555
Do you still hang stockings
if you don't have a family?

10:37.589 --> 10:40.791
We'll hang mistletoe.

10:42.728 --> 10:45.529
Libby, we have a family.

10:45.564 --> 10:48.599
Just the two of us...

10:48.634 --> 10:51.369
That's enough for me.

11:13.392 --> 11:15.793
Barton? Is that you?

11:15.827 --> 11:18.896
Sorry I'm so late.

11:18.930 --> 11:21.966
I was coerced into having drinks
with the new dean of faculty.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.367
Oh.

11:23.402 --> 11:26.037
Now I can tell the board
firsthand what a dullard he is.

11:27.372 --> 11:31.208
Mrs. Scully,
are you reading a dirty book?

11:31.243 --> 11:33.077
A loan from Vivian.

11:33.111 --> 11:34.845
I wanted to read it before I saw it.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.714
Everyone's mad about it.

11:41.119 --> 11:44.221
"She rubbed her fingertips
over her breasts,

11:44.256 --> 11:45.856
"and this caused

11:45.891 --> 11:49.026
"an odd tightening
somewhere between her legs

11:49.061 --> 11:52.830
that puzzled her but was,
somehow, very pleasant."

11:54.866 --> 11:57.635
I'm not sure I want
our daughter reading this.

11:57.669 --> 12:00.404
She's young and curious.

12:00.439 --> 12:04.175
Don't worry.
This phase will pass.

12:06.778 --> 12:09.080
I'm gonna turn in.

12:09.114 --> 12:10.414
Good night, dear.

12:10.449 --> 12:12.750
Night.

12:12.784 --> 12:14.352
Sleep tight.

12:31.903 --> 12:33.637
It's okay. I'll get the next.

12:33.672 --> 12:35.439
Wait, hold on.
I was hoping to run into you.

12:35.474 --> 12:36.640
I've been taking the stairs.

12:36.675 --> 12:38.376
Why?

12:38.410 --> 12:40.845
Because you were hoping
to run into me.

12:40.879 --> 12:43.447
Wait.
What's wrong with that?

12:43.482 --> 12:48.052
I can't...
fix your problem, Austin.

12:48.086 --> 12:49.653
I... I don't need it fixed.

12:49.688 --> 12:51.489
It's not bro...

12:52.691 --> 12:55.926
Look, that's not why
I was looking for you.

12:55.961 --> 12:57.128
I was concerned.

12:57.162 --> 13:00.030
Kathleen said you went
to see a doctor, which...

13:00.065 --> 13:02.466
A different kind of doctor.

13:02.501 --> 13:03.868
The kind you might benefit from.

13:03.902 --> 13:06.637
Uh, a urologist?

13:06.671 --> 13:07.705
A psychoanalyst.

13:07.739 --> 13:09.907
Have you ever read

13:09.941 --> 13:13.110
"On the Universal Tendency towards
Debasement in the Sphere of Love"?

13:13.145 --> 13:15.079
Is that like
"Ode to a Grecian Urn"?

13:15.113 --> 13:19.216
It's not a poem.
It's an essay by Sigmund Freud.

13:19.251 --> 13:20.951
I think you'd find it very illuminating.

13:20.986 --> 13:23.788
Can't you...
give me the headlines?

13:23.822 --> 13:28.091
The problem's not in your pants,
Austin, it's in your head.

13:29.694 --> 13:31.395
Going up?

13:44.009 --> 13:45.342
Is he in?

13:45.377 --> 13:48.546
Oh, he's in Florida,
attempting to vacation.

13:48.580 --> 13:51.315
Is there anything
that I could help you with?

13:51.349 --> 13:53.017
Tell him I had Dr. Papanikolaou

13:53.051 --> 13:55.486
coming in today
to discuss cervical testing.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.388
I thought he might like
to join us for lunch.

13:57.422 --> 13:58.456
Dr. Papanikolas...

13:58.490 --> 13:59.490
Papanikolaou.

13:59.524 --> 14:03.260
To discuss pap smear.

14:05.797 --> 14:07.998
You're familiar with the pap smear?

14:08.033 --> 14:10.901
I try to keep abreast
of what's happening in the field.

14:13.772 --> 14:16.407
Your proposal
for mandatory smear testing

14:16.441 --> 14:18.508
was on Dr. Masters' desk.

14:21.213 --> 14:22.780
If the test detected male cancers,

14:22.814 --> 14:24.515
you'd be reading about it on a billboard.

14:24.549 --> 14:27.184
The test is standard
at New York Hospital...

14:27.219 --> 14:28.352
even on the negro ward.

14:28.386 --> 14:30.020
But not here.

14:30.055 --> 14:32.022
It will if I have
anything to say about it.

14:32.057 --> 14:33.824
I'm going to start
a clinical outreach program.

14:33.859 --> 14:35.426
Any country doctor can perform the test.

14:35.460 --> 14:37.228
They just need to be taught.

14:37.262 --> 14:39.330
That alone could save
millions of women's lives.

14:39.364 --> 14:43.133
I actually may be able to help.

14:43.168 --> 14:44.535
I know I don't have an MD,

14:44.569 --> 14:47.037
but I do know which strings
to pull around here

14:47.072 --> 14:48.105
to get things done.

14:50.475 --> 14:52.042
All right.

14:52.077 --> 14:55.746
I need Dr. Frank and Dr. Canin
to sponsor my proposal.

14:55.780 --> 14:57.381
I need the official sanction

14:57.415 --> 15:00.684
of the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

15:00.719 --> 15:02.419
And I need seed money...

15:02.454 --> 15:04.955
$12,000 for the first 6 months.

15:04.990 --> 15:08.626
Can you pull those strings?

15:15.733 --> 15:18.302
I've never seen
so many palm trees.

15:18.336 --> 15:19.570
It's like the Congo.

15:19.604 --> 15:22.306
Except hotter.

15:22.340 --> 15:26.977
The name is Masters.
Six nights.

15:27.011 --> 15:29.146
Welcome to the Tropicale.

15:29.180 --> 15:32.216
What, um, special occasion
are we celebrating?

15:32.250 --> 15:35.252
It's our anniversary...
10 years.

15:35.286 --> 15:36.553
Well, in that case,

15:36.588 --> 15:39.089
I... I think we can do better
than a junior suite.

15:43.261 --> 15:45.629
He just transferred here
from Northwestern,

15:45.663 --> 15:47.397
a professor of entomology... bugs,

15:47.432 --> 15:49.399
early 60s,
a little on the bald side,

15:49.434 --> 15:51.301
but he's never been married before.

15:51.336 --> 15:54.571
A bald bug doctor.
I can't imagine he has.

15:54.606 --> 15:56.206
Oh, Harriet.

15:56.241 --> 15:57.574
Don't waste your time.

15:57.609 --> 16:02.379
Harriet's evenings are a little
busy lately, aren't they?

16:02.413 --> 16:04.381
Okay.

16:04.415 --> 16:07.251
What Leona is dying
for me to tell you

16:07.285 --> 16:09.286
is that I, um...

16:09.320 --> 16:13.991
I volunteered for a study
at the university...

16:14.025 --> 16:15.726
on human sexuality.

16:18.196 --> 16:19.997
It's for science.

16:20.031 --> 16:21.398
And, um, uh,

16:21.432 --> 16:24.167
the research is being supervised
by Bill Masters.

16:24.202 --> 16:26.503
And he's delivered half of our children.

16:26.537 --> 16:29.339
And there's nothing I've got
that he hasn't seen.

16:29.374 --> 16:31.475
So when you say research,
you mean...

16:31.509 --> 16:33.477
She means sex.

16:36.881 --> 16:38.315
With Robert?

16:38.349 --> 16:40.550
After all the ugliness
you two went through?

16:40.585 --> 16:47.557
Not Robert...
Um...Number M-51-147.

16:47.592 --> 16:49.159
It's completely anonymous.

16:49.193 --> 16:50.327
You don't even know his name?

16:50.361 --> 16:52.829
I know that he's tall,

16:52.864 --> 16:55.132
I know that he has all his hair,

16:55.166 --> 16:58.835
and I know he's taught me more
about how my body works

16:58.870 --> 17:03.307
than Robert did in 23 years.

17:03.341 --> 17:05.509
Oh, God.
Is it that different?

17:08.512 --> 17:10.180
You know what it's like?

17:12.684 --> 17:15.319
My shoes.

17:15.353 --> 17:17.186
Growing up, my mother believed

17:17.221 --> 17:19.890
that ladies were meant
to have small feet.

17:19.924 --> 17:24.361
So she would tell me
"You're a 6 1/2. You're a 6 1/2."

17:24.395 --> 17:28.298
You know, up until my 20's,
I bought shoes that were 6 1/2.

17:28.333 --> 17:31.868
One day, a clerk at
Vandervoort's looked at me

17:31.903 --> 17:34.304
and he said,
"Excuse me, Miss, um,

17:34.339 --> 17:37.741
"I look at feet all day,
and you are not a 6 1/2."

17:37.775 --> 17:42.479
I walked out of there
in a size-8 loafer,

17:42.513 --> 17:49.619
and it felt like I was
walking on...whipped cream.

17:51.956 --> 17:55.125
I can see why the bug doctor
holds little appeal.

18:03.634 --> 18:05.469
As soon as you can.

18:05.503 --> 18:07.270
Of course, sir.

18:11.909 --> 18:18.215
I asked him to have room service
send up some champagne.

18:18.249 --> 18:21.418
It's a king-size.
Could sleep a whole family.

18:26.924 --> 18:28.091
Is that singing?

18:28.126 --> 18:31.194
I think
it's Pop Goes the Weasel.

18:31.229 --> 18:34.264
Now they're jumping on the bed.

18:42.673 --> 18:44.141
Could you put me through
to the front desk?

18:44.175 --> 18:45.675
Bill, you don't have to complain.

18:45.710 --> 18:47.144
It seems there's a
jungle gym in the room next door.

18:47.178 --> 18:48.412
My wife would be...

18:48.446 --> 18:51.982
Never mind.
The room is lovely. Thank you.

18:56.287 --> 18:58.121
I know you want to protect me.

18:58.156 --> 19:03.226
We can't spend the rest of our lives
hiding from other people's children.

19:07.198 --> 19:09.499
I don't think those are children.

19:09.534 --> 19:11.768
Ladies' Home Journal

19:11.803 --> 19:14.204
did name this
the number-one honeymoon spot.

19:14.238 --> 19:17.374
Well, did they specify room 404?

19:18.443 --> 19:19.543
Oh.

19:20.812 --> 19:22.979
Happy anniversary.

19:35.560 --> 19:38.161
"Where they love,
they have no desire.

19:38.196 --> 19:40.464
Where they desire,
they cannot love."

19:40.498 --> 19:41.631
What's that?

19:41.666 --> 19:43.567
Freud on marriage...
I think.

19:43.601 --> 19:44.935
I'm not so sure I care

19:44.969 --> 19:48.438
what a male psychologist has to say
about female sexuality.

19:48.473 --> 19:50.040
He has a cigar.

19:50.074 --> 19:51.842
He obviously knew
what he was talking about.

19:51.876 --> 19:53.877
Really?

19:53.911 --> 19:55.512
Do you want to sleep
with your father?

19:55.546 --> 19:56.680
Do you wish you had a penis?

19:56.714 --> 19:58.348
I wish
a few men around here didn't.

19:58.382 --> 20:00.650
I'll tell you my theory.

20:00.685 --> 20:02.119
Freud was a bad lover.

20:02.153 --> 20:05.822
One night he caught his hausfrau
with her hand in her drawers.

20:05.857 --> 20:08.492
And he's been punishing women
ever since.

20:08.526 --> 20:10.927
I can climax when
someone is touching my breast.

20:13.397 --> 20:15.132
You can? Is that true?

20:15.166 --> 20:17.100
Well, not all the time,
but it has happened.

20:17.135 --> 20:19.002
Wow.

20:19.036 --> 20:22.906
He would call that
an immature orgasm, right?

20:22.940 --> 20:24.207
Do you really believe

20:24.242 --> 20:25.842
that there's a difference
between orgasms?

20:25.877 --> 20:27.644
Well, they wouldn't say it
if it wasn't true.

20:27.678 --> 20:30.480
They said the world
was flat until somebody asked.

20:30.515 --> 20:32.048
Well, then, where does it end?

20:32.083 --> 20:35.752
I think that Freud's theories
have their limits.

20:35.786 --> 20:37.454
I mean, he was a psychologist.

20:37.488 --> 20:41.725
We, on the other hand...
We have science on our side.

20:41.759 --> 20:42.726
We?

20:50.701 --> 20:51.801
Bill.

20:51.836 --> 20:53.904
Bill, Bill.

20:53.938 --> 20:55.138
Shut the door. Shut the door.

20:58.242 --> 20:59.809
That's them.
It's the honeymooners.

21:05.316 --> 21:08.018
That's "Pop Goes the Weasel."

21:08.052 --> 21:11.021
So we will leave your
breasts out of this entirely.

21:11.055 --> 21:12.022
Understood.

21:12.056 --> 21:13.256
And while you use Ulysses,

21:13.291 --> 21:16.026
I'll be monitoring your vital signs
and notating visual changes...

21:16.060 --> 21:17.694
Blood pressure, respiration,
rate of contractions.

21:17.728 --> 21:18.795
You've done this before.

21:18.829 --> 21:22.499
But always
while Dr. Masters is here.

21:22.533 --> 21:24.100
Do you think he'll be
okay with us doing this

21:24.135 --> 21:25.802
while he's out of town?

21:25.836 --> 21:28.305
If the data's compelling,
he won't give it a second thought.

21:28.339 --> 21:29.472
Okay, stud.

21:29.507 --> 21:32.008
Dr. Freud's reputation
is depending on you.

21:32.043 --> 21:34.044
Don't put
too much pressure on him.

21:34.078 --> 21:35.412
We all know how that turns out.

21:35.446 --> 21:39.216
And remember,
no clitoral stimulation.

21:39.250 --> 21:40.951
What if I accidentally touch it?

21:40.985 --> 21:42.686
It's not like
I've got eyes down there.

21:42.720 --> 21:43.920
Well, do your best, Jane.

21:43.955 --> 21:45.155
And when you're done with Ulysses,

21:45.189 --> 21:47.757
then we will take
as long of a break as you need

21:47.792 --> 21:50.560
and we'll start in again
using manual stimulation.

21:50.595 --> 21:55.198
Then...we will let the facts
speak for themselves.

21:56.968 --> 21:59.703
EEG readouts match to a "T."

21:59.737 --> 22:01.905
Cardiac response is identical...

22:01.939 --> 22:04.874
as are all other
physiological responses.

22:04.909 --> 22:08.812
Actually, there's
a slight uptick in this one...

22:08.846 --> 22:10.680
in terms of intensity.

22:10.715 --> 22:12.148
Was that the Ulysses or...

22:12.183 --> 22:14.417
You. Solo.

22:16.654 --> 22:20.824
My clitoris beat my vagina?

22:20.858 --> 22:22.892
That's crazy.

22:34.605 --> 22:36.539
I believe
the weasel is popping again.

22:36.574 --> 22:37.874
That makes three times
in one day.

22:37.908 --> 22:40.577
But who's counting?

22:40.611 --> 22:42.679
You'd think
they'd die of exhaustion.

22:42.713 --> 22:43.847
They must be 70 years old.

22:43.881 --> 22:46.049
Well, Mr. Dooley from church

22:46.083 --> 22:49.319
plays a round of golf every morning,
and he's almost 80.

22:49.353 --> 22:51.988
It's uncanny.
They're like lions.

22:52.023 --> 22:54.357
Uh, when an African lioness
is in estrus,

22:54.392 --> 22:57.093
she copulates every
15 minutes for a week.

22:57.128 --> 23:01.631
There were girls
like that in my sorority.

23:01.666 --> 23:02.699
Come to bed.

23:02.733 --> 23:05.368
She's in the plateau state.

23:05.403 --> 23:11.775
And we are in
the sunshine state...to relax.

23:21.886 --> 23:25.588
We could, um, give them
a run for their money...

23:25.623 --> 23:28.325
Try to drown them out.

23:38.336 --> 23:39.469
What are you doing?

23:39.503 --> 23:40.537
Nothing.

23:43.507 --> 23:44.641
Are you timing them?

23:44.675 --> 23:46.109
They're senior citizens.

23:46.143 --> 23:49.713
Their endocrine systems don't
produce sex hormones anymore.

23:49.747 --> 23:52.248
It's like from
a medical standpoint, it's...

23:52.283 --> 23:53.650
Peculiar.

23:53.684 --> 23:57.220
And not very flattering
to the woman who is in this bed

23:57.254 --> 23:59.322
who happens to be your wife.

24:04.695 --> 24:07.964
It's like something out of Ripley's.

24:10.935 --> 24:12.335
Excuse me?

24:12.370 --> 24:14.738
Um, my friend told me
about this study.

24:14.772 --> 24:18.241
You're looking for participants?
I was hoping to apply.

24:18.275 --> 24:20.110
You're looking
for Dr. William Masters.

24:20.144 --> 24:21.511
He's out until Monday.

24:21.545 --> 24:24.948
I'm sorry. My friend
said she met with a woman...

24:24.982 --> 24:26.549
A Dr. Johnson I assumed...

24:26.584 --> 24:29.352
Mrs. Johnson
is Dr. Masters' secretary.

24:29.387 --> 24:32.122
You'll find her
down the corridor to the left...

24:32.156 --> 24:34.758
Small, brunette, ambitious.

24:34.792 --> 24:38.128
Thank you.

24:38.162 --> 24:40.163
She's not a doctor.

24:40.197 --> 24:42.165
Bill, I know how to read an EKG.

24:42.199 --> 24:44.367
And I'm telling you,
they're indistinguishable.

24:44.402 --> 24:46.603
Except one was a little longer
and a little stronger.

24:46.637 --> 24:47.637
Care to guess which?

24:47.671 --> 24:48.838
I would not.

24:48.873 --> 24:50.807
A clitoral orgasm is just as good

24:50.841 --> 24:52.842
as a vaginal orgasm...
maybe even better.

24:52.877 --> 24:54.811
Based on your extensive study.

24:54.845 --> 24:55.945
Well, it's a start.

24:55.980 --> 24:57.647
This is something, Bill.
I know it.

24:57.681 --> 24:59.616
The only thing I don't know

24:59.650 --> 25:01.618
is how two orgasms
can be the same

25:01.652 --> 25:04.354
since they involve two
completely different body parts.

25:04.388 --> 25:06.723
Put down the phone
and pick up in my office.

25:06.757 --> 25:08.158
I'm in your office.

25:08.192 --> 25:11.294
Really? In my chair?

25:11.328 --> 25:12.495
Standing. Actually.

25:12.530 --> 25:15.365
Well, face the door... 10:00.

25:15.399 --> 25:18.601
Third or fourth from the right,
there's an anatomy textbook.

25:24.842 --> 25:28.711
This is from...
the University of Rochester?

25:31.382 --> 25:33.550
Bill, it's 12 years overdue.

25:33.584 --> 25:35.151
Refer me
to the ethics committee.

25:35.186 --> 25:36.519
Now, there's a plate in the back...

25:36.554 --> 25:40.223
Uh, a cross section
of the female's sex organs.

25:40.257 --> 25:42.692
See how the clitoral crura extend

25:42.726 --> 25:45.562
along the pubic arch
almost to the bone?

25:45.596 --> 25:49.966
It's at least conceivable
that Freud's mature orgasm...

25:50.000 --> 25:51.701
Is just another clitoral orgasm.

25:51.735 --> 25:54.070
Because the clitoris
is stimulated in both cases.

25:54.104 --> 25:55.638
So, uh, does this mean that...

25:55.673 --> 25:56.973
Keep going.

25:57.007 --> 26:00.376
Well, it means
that a woman doesn't need a man

26:00.411 --> 26:02.078
to provide pleasure at all.

26:02.112 --> 26:04.180
In fact, we may be better off
without you.

26:04.215 --> 26:06.416
That was not exactly my point.

26:06.450 --> 26:09.152
And let's not burn Freud
in effigy just yet, either.

26:09.186 --> 26:11.354
We're talking about
a single data point.

26:11.388 --> 26:13.022
One woman does not a study make.

26:13.057 --> 26:14.524
But why couldn't it
be an entire study?

26:14.558 --> 26:16.860
We'll start when I get back.

26:26.971 --> 26:31.875
Uh, the guide book is useless...
Unless you want to see

26:31.909 --> 26:35.378
a seminole Indian
wrestle an alligator.

26:42.453 --> 26:44.187
This isn't working.

26:44.221 --> 26:47.690
I think you look nice.

26:47.725 --> 26:49.192
No, Bill...

26:51.161 --> 26:54.430
I... I thought that getting away
would make things better.

26:55.499 --> 26:58.201
Libby...

26:58.235 --> 27:01.704
We obviously have
different ways of grieving.

27:01.739 --> 27:04.908
And you... You need your work.

27:04.942 --> 27:07.844
And I need...

27:14.018 --> 27:16.286
There must be
a flight out tonight.

27:29.767 --> 27:32.135
We can come back...
in the fall.

27:32.169 --> 27:34.203
We'll make a week of it.

27:37.174 --> 27:38.942
I'm staying.

27:42.146 --> 27:43.546
I don't understand.

27:43.581 --> 27:46.549
I want to be here.

27:46.584 --> 27:48.151
And I don't need you here

27:48.185 --> 27:50.119
if you are more interested
in what is happening

27:50.154 --> 27:53.957
next door or back at the office.

27:53.991 --> 27:56.960
Well, I can't leave you...

27:56.994 --> 27:59.596
alone.

28:03.233 --> 28:06.269
If that is
the reason that you'd stay,

28:06.303 --> 28:08.438
then I would rather
that you didn't.

28:08.472 --> 28:10.506
No, I...

28:13.410 --> 28:19.983
Bill, I'm not...
I'm not gonna argue with you.

28:20.017 --> 28:23.786
But I'm not asking either.

28:26.957 --> 28:27.924
Go.

28:36.300 --> 28:38.267
Look, I skimmed
that Freud article and frankly,

28:38.302 --> 28:40.370
a lot of it
seemed like bullshit to me...

28:40.404 --> 28:43.106
All the stuff about mothers.

28:43.140 --> 28:45.408
I'm not in love
with my mother, okay?

28:45.442 --> 28:46.609
It's interesting

28:46.644 --> 28:48.177
that that's what you took away
from the article.

28:48.212 --> 28:50.546
Let's explore that for a moment then.

28:53.651 --> 28:55.551
Would you say
you love your mother?

28:57.588 --> 29:00.156
My mom has nothing to do
with my penis.

29:00.190 --> 29:04.360
What if we were
to posit... just posit...

29:04.395 --> 29:07.563
that this sex study
caused you to feel judged.

29:09.500 --> 29:11.868
Well, you'd want to return
to a place free of judgment,

29:11.902 --> 29:13.603
wouldn't you?

29:13.637 --> 29:14.904
But this is a place

29:14.938 --> 29:17.907
that you associate with
a kind of maternal love

29:17.941 --> 29:21.110
which, when sexualized,
feels wrong... illicit.

29:21.145 --> 29:23.246
So your body has short-circuited

29:23.280 --> 29:26.182
as a means
of solving the problem for you.

29:28.719 --> 29:31.120
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

29:31.155 --> 29:32.422
I think you do.

29:32.456 --> 29:36.492
No. No, I... I don't.
I... I really don't.

29:36.527 --> 29:38.027
I think you do.

29:41.031 --> 29:45.401
Nurse Howell,
please report to neonatal.

30:02.820 --> 30:04.020
Virginia?

30:04.054 --> 30:06.355
Oh, Mrs. Scully,
how nice to see you.

30:06.390 --> 30:09.525
I, uh...was just
meeting my daughter for lunch

30:09.560 --> 30:13.129
and thought I might pop in
and say hello.

30:13.163 --> 30:15.398
Vivian is doing a wonderful job.

30:15.432 --> 30:17.166
Everyone here just loves her.

30:17.201 --> 30:19.435
Well, she says you've
been especially kind to her.

30:19.470 --> 30:23.806
You wouldn't think a girl that pretty
would have confidence problems, but...

30:23.841 --> 30:26.242
maybe that's the one thing
she got from me.

30:27.911 --> 30:31.047
Well, I'm sorry to tell you
Dr. Masters is out of town.

30:31.081 --> 30:32.115
What? Hmm?

30:32.149 --> 30:34.016
Oh, you wanted to say hello?

30:36.153 --> 30:38.621
T-to you.

30:38.655 --> 30:40.690
Oh.

30:42.860 --> 30:46.028
Would you mind if I...

30:46.063 --> 30:48.664
No.

31:31.275 --> 31:34.343
By the time I count to 10,
your hands better be washed.

31:34.378 --> 31:36.112
- Henry, I mean it.
- Hello?

31:36.146 --> 31:37.180
Virginia, it's Bill.

31:37.214 --> 31:38.581
Oh, Bill, good...

31:38.615 --> 31:41.083
You will never guess
who came to see me today...

31:41.118 --> 31:42.785
Mama, Henry's making me
do all of it...

31:42.820 --> 31:44.487
Bill, you know,
I'm actually just...

31:44.521 --> 31:46.722
I'm getting dinner on the table
for the kids.

31:46.757 --> 31:48.958
Do you mind if I...
if I call you right back?

31:48.992 --> 31:52.161
I'm at home.

31:52.196 --> 31:53.696
What's that?

31:53.730 --> 31:55.932
I'm back. I came back.

31:55.966 --> 31:57.600
Oh, is everything all right?

31:57.634 --> 31:58.868
Did the... Did the weather turn?

31:58.902 --> 32:00.570
Uh, Libby stayed.

32:02.840 --> 32:04.941
Oh.

32:04.975 --> 32:08.978
I think we should plan a session

32:09.012 --> 32:10.713
for tomorrow night.

32:10.747 --> 32:14.550
Get some data on your hypothesis.

32:14.585 --> 32:17.186
That men are completely unnecessary.

32:44.248 --> 32:47.183
Uh, excuse me, Miss,

32:47.217 --> 32:48.918
would you care to join us?

32:48.952 --> 32:51.687
It took us forever to get a table.

32:51.722 --> 32:53.689
That would be lovely.

32:53.724 --> 32:56.859
Thank you.

32:56.894 --> 32:59.095
They sat us over there
first under an air vent.

32:59.129 --> 33:00.830
I didn't know
you could freeze in Miami.

33:01.965 --> 33:03.466
My wife detests
air-conditioning.

33:03.500 --> 33:05.568
And he'd like
to sleep in an ice box.

33:08.138 --> 33:10.539
May I ask you two, um, how...
How long you've been married?

33:10.574 --> 33:14.210
180 years.
With time off for good behavior.

33:14.244 --> 33:15.578
We met in high school.

33:15.612 --> 33:17.246
He was captain
of the wrestling team,

33:17.281 --> 33:18.681
and I was a pom-pom girl.

33:18.715 --> 33:20.483
I pinned her in the first round.

33:21.652 --> 33:23.052
Well, I think it's very romantic.

33:23.086 --> 33:26.055
All those years and you could
still be mistaken for newlyweds.

33:26.089 --> 33:27.890
I'll tell you the trick.

33:27.925 --> 33:29.825
You shower your children
with love

33:29.860 --> 33:33.062
until they're 18 years of age,
then you kick them the hell out.

33:33.096 --> 33:35.331
Gives your marriage
a fresh coat of paint.

33:35.365 --> 33:37.166
We have three boys. And you?

33:37.200 --> 33:41.237
Um...I have a...
I have a boy and a girl.

33:41.271 --> 33:45.474
Oh, well, I bet they're
both as gorgeous as their mother.

33:45.509 --> 33:53.249
Um, well, Timmy...
Timmy is my rock and he's 12,

33:53.283 --> 33:54.617
and Susan is 10.

33:54.651 --> 33:57.253
Well, when they're
18 years old... out.

33:57.287 --> 33:58.354
And tell your husband.

33:59.556 --> 34:02.892
Um, my, um...
my husband is dead.

34:08.264 --> 34:11.000
A plane crash.

34:11.034 --> 34:15.471
You're still wearing his ring.
Oh, you poor lamb.

34:15.505 --> 34:20.309
Oh, it was a...
It was a long time ago.

34:20.344 --> 34:24.679
When it first happened,
I kept thinking...

34:24.715 --> 34:28.851
I would wake up
and discover it was all a dream.

34:30.821 --> 34:33.556
Then I realized it was up to me

34:33.590 --> 34:36.292
to decide
what kind of life I would have.

34:39.129 --> 34:41.831
God helps those
who help themselves.

34:47.103 --> 34:49.672
It'll be a full house tonight.

34:49.706 --> 34:52.908
And have you told them
what'll be expected of them?

34:52.943 --> 34:55.777
One go-round
with Ulysses and one without.

34:55.812 --> 34:59.382
There is one candidate
that I need to run by you...

34:59.416 --> 35:00.916
Margaret Scully.

35:03.453 --> 35:05.621
You want to enlist
the provost's wife?

35:05.655 --> 35:07.690
She came to see me yesterday.

35:07.724 --> 35:11.761
She seemed very anxious to make
some kind of a contribution.

35:11.795 --> 35:14.330
I'm sure she meant financially.

35:14.364 --> 35:17.166
Bill, she knows about the study.

35:17.200 --> 35:19.402
And she wants to be a part of it.

35:19.436 --> 35:20.569
And is she aware

35:20.604 --> 35:21.871
of her husband's reservations
about the study?

35:21.905 --> 35:23.706
I don't know.

35:23.740 --> 35:26.342
I do know that she does not
intend to tell him about it.

35:26.376 --> 35:28.277
She was very clear about that.

35:28.311 --> 35:32.815
I, of course,
said I needed to check with you.

35:32.849 --> 35:35.317
I don't think
it's a wise decision.

35:35.352 --> 35:37.553
We let Lorraine Bach in.

35:37.587 --> 35:39.055
Her husband's on the board.

35:39.089 --> 35:41.957
If she wants to make
a contribution to science,

35:41.992 --> 35:44.192
why would we turn her away?

35:48.999 --> 35:51.967
There you are.
And what would you like?

35:52.002 --> 35:53.736
Three more daiquiris.

35:58.909 --> 36:01.577
Mmm. So much for lunch.

36:03.346 --> 36:06.449
Well, you know, you got to
get your jollies while you can.

36:06.483 --> 36:08.751
Khrushchev's got his finger
on the button.

36:08.785 --> 36:11.420
One push and we're just dust
blowing over Aruba.

36:11.455 --> 36:12.888
Don't be so gloomy.

36:12.923 --> 36:15.157
I can't bear to watch the news.

36:15.192 --> 36:17.126
I think
that Eisenhower's a weasel.

36:18.995 --> 36:21.330
Here I thought
that you liked weasels.

36:23.166 --> 36:26.402
Oh, uh...um...

36:26.436 --> 36:30.072
I... I think that you have
the room next to mine.

36:30.107 --> 36:31.507
402?

36:31.541 --> 36:33.876
Thin walls.

36:35.912 --> 36:39.782
My Tommy used to love that song.

36:39.816 --> 36:42.518
# Do do-do-do do #

36:42.552 --> 36:44.520
I used to sing him to sleep
at night.

36:44.554 --> 36:49.758
No, is it...
Is it Tommy...or...or Timmy?

36:49.793 --> 36:52.595
Um...

36:52.629 --> 36:56.298
It, uh... it's, uh...
It's Thomas.

36:56.333 --> 36:57.933
But I call him Timmy.

36:57.968 --> 37:01.070
It's a long story.

37:05.308 --> 37:08.010
Uh, I guess
I must've been, what?

37:08.044 --> 37:10.246
Let's see. Um...

37:10.280 --> 37:15.784
Al-almost 20...
My daughter's age.

37:17.354 --> 37:20.656
And how often do you engage
in intercourse now?

37:23.960 --> 37:26.695
I'm sorry the questions
are so personal, Margaret.

37:26.730 --> 37:29.999
Um, if this is too awkward...

37:30.033 --> 37:32.935
No, of course not.
It's all right.

37:34.771 --> 37:37.740
Thank you, Bill.

37:37.774 --> 37:42.645
Whoo, well, Barton's
a very busy man, you know.

37:42.679 --> 37:45.014
Things tapered off...

37:45.048 --> 37:47.983
considerably after Vivian was born.

37:48.018 --> 37:49.552
On average,
what would you say?

37:49.586 --> 37:51.487
We just need to quantify it
with a number.

37:56.626 --> 37:59.395
Once a year...or less.

38:01.831 --> 38:05.968
And what is
your orgasmic response?

38:07.337 --> 38:12.441
Your physical response
during intercourse.

38:12.475 --> 38:15.077
It's, you know...

38:18.648 --> 38:22.484
Not...really painful exactly,

38:22.519 --> 38:26.956
m-more like...uh, rubbing.

38:26.990 --> 38:30.926
Rubbing...
It's a rubbing sensation...

38:30.961 --> 38:37.600
that can feel
I'd say...protracted.

38:37.634 --> 38:42.905
And this sensation,
does it build to anything...

38:42.939 --> 38:45.074
a feeling of pleasure,

38:45.108 --> 38:49.044
a kind of ache,
a tensing of the muscles?

38:49.079 --> 38:51.347
There is a certain tension. Yes.

38:51.381 --> 38:53.582
And do you experience release?

38:53.617 --> 38:57.286
Oh, when it's over?
Absolutely... Tremendous relief.

39:01.224 --> 39:02.458
Margaret...

39:02.492 --> 39:06.395
Have you ever experienced
an orgasm?

39:10.233 --> 39:13.335
I don't know.

39:13.370 --> 39:14.470
Maybe.

39:14.504 --> 39:17.906
You would know.

39:17.941 --> 39:18.907
I would?

39:18.942 --> 39:20.943
Yes.

39:20.977 --> 39:25.547
Then, no. I guess not.

39:25.582 --> 39:28.717
But I'm a fast learner.
I taught myself Italian.

39:28.752 --> 39:30.619
I'm sure with a little instruction...

39:30.654 --> 39:32.855
Unfortunately,
this study is limited

39:32.889 --> 39:38.327
to subjects...
that have had an orgasm.

39:42.532 --> 39:43.999
Without exception?

39:44.034 --> 39:46.168
That is one of our baselines.

39:46.202 --> 39:48.470
We've had to make it
a hard and fast rule

39:48.505 --> 39:50.973
in order for the data
to be consistent.

39:51.007 --> 39:54.376
We're investigating the
entire cycle of sexual response,

39:54.411 --> 39:56.512
from initial excitement
through to climax.

39:56.546 --> 40:00.215
No, of... of course.
That makes sense.

40:00.250 --> 40:02.718
I... I understand completely.

40:02.752 --> 40:06.989
And I... I'm... I am so sorry
to have wasted your time.

40:07.023 --> 40:08.123
Margaret.

40:08.158 --> 40:09.591
Bill.

41:04.114 --> 41:06.081
Morris.
Is the, uh...

41:06.116 --> 41:07.916
Is the music too loud?
I can turn it off.

41:07.951 --> 41:12.087
Holy moly,
I thought our room was plush.

41:13.656 --> 41:14.957
You could...

41:14.991 --> 41:16.725
Well, you could park
a Cadillac in here.

41:18.027 --> 41:20.863
Oh, listen, I, um...
I pinched this from the bar.

41:22.065 --> 41:23.565
Barb and I thought

41:23.600 --> 41:26.535
you just might like
to join us for a... a nightcap.

41:26.569 --> 41:28.404
Oh,
the room would start spinning.

41:28.438 --> 41:30.773
Well, there's a cure for that.

41:30.807 --> 41:33.242
You just spin
in the opposite direction.

41:33.276 --> 41:35.511
I bet you're a bang-up dancer.

41:35.545 --> 41:38.247
Now, look at you.
You're built like a ballet dancer.

41:38.281 --> 41:39.982
Do it.

41:40.016 --> 41:41.717
Again.

41:41.751 --> 41:44.720
Come here.

41:46.756 --> 41:49.358
Maybe...
Maybe we should go meet Barb.

41:49.392 --> 41:52.428
Well, actually, uh...

41:52.462 --> 41:54.797
Barb turned in already
for the night.

41:54.831 --> 41:58.767
I...told a little white lie.
Is my nose growing?

41:58.802 --> 42:01.136
Morris...

42:01.171 --> 42:02.271
Hmm?

42:02.305 --> 42:05.107
I know another way
to make the room spin.

42:05.141 --> 42:06.875
Barb is right next door.

42:06.910 --> 42:09.445
Barb likes to listen
just like you.

42:09.479 --> 42:12.614
What? What?

42:12.649 --> 42:15.651
But she's your wife.

42:15.685 --> 42:19.021
Well, your wife
is like your home...

42:19.055 --> 42:22.658
You live there,
you know every nook and cranny.

42:22.692 --> 42:26.228
But it's always nice to travel...

42:26.262 --> 42:28.263
Hmm? Sleep in different beds.

42:28.298 --> 42:31.767
You should leave
before I call my husband.

42:31.801 --> 42:34.102
Wait a minute,
I thought your husband was dead.

42:34.137 --> 42:35.971
Well, you misunderstood me.

42:41.211 --> 42:42.878
Okay.

43:03.132 --> 43:05.300
What do you call this?

43:05.335 --> 43:07.035
Shepherd's pie.

43:07.070 --> 43:10.205
Just sensational.

43:10.240 --> 43:12.508
Ethan cooked dinner
for me the other night.

43:12.542 --> 43:14.176
Oh? How was it?

43:14.210 --> 43:16.979
He made a piece of meat
that tasted like a desk blotter.

43:17.013 --> 43:19.014
Well, I hope you were polite.

43:19.048 --> 43:21.383
It's always nice to be encouraging
of men's efforts in the kitchen.

43:21.417 --> 43:23.652
Your father can't boil water.

43:23.686 --> 43:26.421
I made an omelette once
when you had your tonsillectomy.

43:26.456 --> 43:28.624
You ruined the wallpaper.

43:28.658 --> 43:32.027
You ever seen the way
short-order cooks flip eggs?

43:32.061 --> 43:34.029
We had to repaper
the whole kitchen.

43:34.063 --> 43:35.831
It's all in the wrist.

43:35.865 --> 43:39.801
I loved that old wallpaper.

43:40.136 --> 43:44.739
Why don't you two
go out after dinner?

43:44.774 --> 43:47.509
What for?

43:47.543 --> 43:49.277
I don't know. A change of pace.

43:49.312 --> 43:50.812
Well, it's already 7:30.

43:50.847 --> 43:52.681
So?

43:52.715 --> 43:56.852
Get a sundae down at Schiff's
or...go to the pictures.

43:56.886 --> 43:58.653
"Peyton Place" is playing
at the Rialto.

43:58.688 --> 44:00.388
So what if you haven't
finished the book?

44:00.423 --> 44:01.756
You could make the 8:00.

44:05.261 --> 44:07.229
Tell you what,
you go, sweetheart.

44:07.263 --> 44:10.031
I know how much
you like those weepers.

44:10.066 --> 44:13.634
I'd be asleep
before the second reel.

44:21.744 --> 44:24.346
You have a minute, Dr. Masters?

44:24.380 --> 44:26.514
I'm assuming Virginia is gone
for the evening.

44:26.549 --> 44:28.817
Actually, no.
She went to get sandwiches.

44:28.851 --> 44:32.520
She'll be back.

44:32.555 --> 44:35.624
I'm sorry for missing lunch
the other day.

44:35.658 --> 44:37.659
You and Dr. Papanikolaou
have known each other

44:37.693 --> 44:39.027
for a long time?

44:39.061 --> 44:41.696
When I became interested
in cytopathology at Penn,

44:41.731 --> 44:43.298
he and I exchanged correspondence.

44:43.332 --> 44:44.733
And he mentored you?

44:44.767 --> 44:46.668
No.
He answered a few questions.

44:46.702 --> 44:49.070
I've never had a mentor.

44:49.105 --> 44:52.774
Oh. Well, they, uh...
They help, of course,

44:52.808 --> 44:55.443
but they're not entirely necessary.

44:55.478 --> 44:57.679
You've done excellent work
without one.

44:57.713 --> 45:00.849
Maybe if there'd been
more women ahead of me.

45:00.883 --> 45:03.518
Don't you find it interesting,
Dr. Masters,

45:03.552 --> 45:06.688
that obstetrics is a field
dominated by men?

45:06.722 --> 45:09.891
Medicine is a field
dominated by men.

45:09.926 --> 45:11.826
And at least twice a day,

45:11.861 --> 45:14.429
I'm mistaken for a member
of this secretary pool,

45:14.463 --> 45:15.797
just because I'm a woman.

45:15.831 --> 45:17.599
And yet, your secretary...

45:17.633 --> 45:20.268
Mrs. Johnson?

45:20.303 --> 45:22.671
Don't you mean "Dr. Johnson"?

45:22.705 --> 45:25.273
That's how patients address her
when you're not here.

45:25.308 --> 45:28.043
She acts like she's in charge.

45:28.077 --> 45:30.178
She acts like a professional.

45:30.212 --> 45:32.047
If a patient mistakes her
for a doctor,

45:32.081 --> 45:33.381
that's likely the reason why.

45:33.416 --> 45:35.350
Then she should handle
their mistakes

45:35.384 --> 45:37.018
like a professional
and correct them.

45:37.053 --> 45:41.022
Mrs. Johnson hasn't earned
those credentials

45:41.057 --> 45:44.759
and I take offense to a woman
who uses her beauty and allure

45:44.794 --> 45:46.928
as a substitute
for the knowledge and skill

45:46.963 --> 45:48.363
I sacrificed years to acquire.

45:48.397 --> 45:51.032
So, why aren't you
having this conversation

45:51.067 --> 45:52.067
with Mrs. Johnson?

45:54.603 --> 45:58.940
Because I respect you
as a colleague, Dr. Masters.

45:58.975 --> 46:01.376
In fact, I admired your intellect
long before I knew you.

46:01.410 --> 46:02.510
But at this moment,

46:02.545 --> 46:03.979
it would seem
the mind I had so esteemed

46:04.013 --> 46:05.947
is out-matched
by another part of your anatomy.

46:05.982 --> 46:10.719
I can't help but wonder which
part is making the judgments.

46:18.160 --> 46:20.829
All right, let's talk about this.

46:20.863 --> 46:25.300
I don't want to talk.
I just want you to leave.

46:25.334 --> 46:26.601
Just like that?

46:26.635 --> 46:27.836
That's right.

46:27.870 --> 46:29.537
We're not kids, we're adults.

46:29.572 --> 46:31.606
And we're going
to behave like adults.

46:31.640 --> 46:33.174
I kissed you, you kissed me.

46:33.209 --> 46:35.977
That's affection, not carnality.
That's affection, not lust.

46:36.012 --> 46:37.579
You ought to know the difference.

46:37.613 --> 46:38.880
And what do you call a man

46:38.914 --> 46:42.217
who thinks about nothing but...

46:42.251 --> 46:43.418
Human.

47:05.074 --> 47:07.342
Mrs. Scully?

47:07.376 --> 47:09.878
Oh, Dr. Langham,
w-what a nice surprise.

47:09.912 --> 47:11.513
Dr. Scully?

47:11.547 --> 47:16.351
Oh, no, um, he couldn't make it.
It's not really his cup of tea.

47:16.385 --> 47:18.219
And your pretty wife?

47:18.254 --> 47:21.623
Oh, Elise is in bed
by 9:00...every single night...

47:21.657 --> 47:23.158
Three kids, you know.

47:23.192 --> 47:25.794
Me, on the other hand,
I can't fall asleep before 2:00.

47:31.634 --> 47:32.867
Can I walk you to your car?

47:32.902 --> 47:36.037
Oh, thank you.

47:36.072 --> 47:38.606
So, what do you for that...
Your insomnia?

47:38.641 --> 47:41.943
Go to movies...
Doesn't matter which ones.

47:41.977 --> 47:44.546
Um, swim laps
at the university pool.

47:44.580 --> 47:45.847
The pool was closed tonight.

47:45.881 --> 47:47.682
I used to swim in college...

47:47.716 --> 47:50.285
The one place being tall
actually worked to my advantage.

47:50.319 --> 47:54.222
I'm just up ahead.

47:54.256 --> 47:55.323
Sometimes, if I can't sleep,

47:55.357 --> 47:57.158
I just walk
around the neighborhood.

47:59.462 --> 48:01.830
You know what's strange,
when you're outside looking in,

48:01.864 --> 48:03.832
there's always a glow
to someone else's house.

48:03.866 --> 48:05.366
But when it's you inside,

48:05.401 --> 48:08.470
you can't imagine anyone
looking through your window

48:08.504 --> 48:09.904
and seeing it that way.

48:09.939 --> 48:14.309
I'm sorry, that's not...
I don't know what I'm saying.

48:14.343 --> 48:17.245
That made perfect sense to me.

48:17.279 --> 48:19.781
It did?

48:19.815 --> 48:23.585
You're a deep thinker.

48:23.619 --> 48:26.387
Well, not really, not me.

48:26.422 --> 48:29.724
I failed my boards twice.

48:29.758 --> 48:32.293
I shouldn't go telling that
to the provost's wife, though.

48:33.395 --> 48:35.430
I can keep a secret.

48:35.464 --> 48:37.732
Oh, you were probably
just nervous.

48:37.766 --> 48:40.235
I get nervous taking an eye exam.

48:45.407 --> 48:48.543
I, um...

48:48.577 --> 48:50.512
I participated
in this study recently...

48:50.546 --> 48:54.482
It wasn't a test exactly...
but it was kind of, um...

48:54.517 --> 48:56.784
a performance evaluation.

48:56.819 --> 48:59.120
The pressure really got to me.

48:59.155 --> 49:00.488
A study at the hospital?

49:00.523 --> 49:05.360
Doesn't matter.

49:05.394 --> 49:08.396
Whenever my daughter
has a test, I tell her

49:08.430 --> 49:10.965
to just close your eyes,
take a deep breath,

49:11.000 --> 49:14.369
and remember you know
more than you think you do.

49:14.403 --> 49:19.240
It all comes back to you
when you can just...relax.

49:20.876 --> 49:22.343
This is me.

49:24.713 --> 49:28.049
Say, um, I didn't ask you.

49:28.083 --> 49:29.851
What'd you think of the movie?

49:29.885 --> 49:31.619
I'm such a sap.

49:31.654 --> 49:33.755
I cried through the whole thing,
can't you tell?

49:33.789 --> 49:37.225
I don't usually look like this...

49:37.259 --> 49:38.560
Look like what?

49:38.594 --> 49:39.627
Like...

49:45.701 --> 49:47.302
Like this.

50:21.570 --> 50:24.639
Yes.

50:53.002 --> 50:54.035
Did you get what you wanted?

50:54.069 --> 50:56.004
We did. Thank you.

50:59.174 --> 51:00.675
I'm in nursing school actually.

51:00.709 --> 51:01.976
Oh?

51:02.011 --> 51:04.412
So all of this
is really interesting to me.

51:04.446 --> 51:06.681
It's funny. I thought
you were a doctor before.

51:06.715 --> 51:07.715
Me? Oh, no.

51:07.750 --> 51:09.484
Oh, you act like one...

51:09.518 --> 51:11.919
Like you could've gone
to medical school.

51:11.954 --> 51:18.259
Instead I got married.
And divorced...twice. Had kids.

51:18.294 --> 51:21.229
I didn't know I was good at this
before it was too late.

51:21.263 --> 51:26.367
Well, I'm not getting
married till I'm 36. I've decided.

51:26.402 --> 51:28.670
Besides, I can take care of myself.

51:29.605 --> 51:32.507
In more ways than one, I guess.

51:32.541 --> 51:35.276
Let's hope there are
more and more like you.

51:35.311 --> 51:39.213
'Cause when a woman can please herself
as well as man can, or better...

51:39.248 --> 51:40.615
it's a brave new world.

51:46.088 --> 51:48.956
How many more until there's
an adequate sampling...

51:48.991 --> 51:51.326
50? 75?

51:51.360 --> 51:53.328
I don't want you
as my secretary anymore.

51:53.362 --> 51:55.129
What?

51:57.666 --> 51:59.600
I've given this serious thought.

52:01.603 --> 52:03.571
Are you firing me?

52:03.605 --> 52:04.839
Again? Bill...

52:04.873 --> 52:06.674
I think you should have
a different title.

52:06.709 --> 52:09.944
One that reflects
the work you're doing.

52:10.378 --> 52:14.448
'Cause you're not
just a secretary, are you?

52:14.483 --> 52:16.250
What am I?

52:16.284 --> 52:19.019
You're a research assistant.

52:19.054 --> 52:21.288
And you're a very good one.

52:24.359 --> 52:28.028
I'm not giving you a raise
or your own separate office,

52:28.063 --> 52:31.232
but we'll get someone in
who can assist us both...

52:31.266 --> 52:34.735
A secretary.

52:34.770 --> 52:38.706
With a secretary, I could...
I could just focus on the work.

52:38.740 --> 52:44.245
Well,
it seems like the right time.

52:44.279 --> 52:47.782
So then you agree
that we're on to something.

52:47.816 --> 52:49.817
It's not science to operate

52:49.851 --> 52:51.919
from a series
of unproven assumptions.

52:51.953 --> 52:53.254
That's dogma...

52:53.288 --> 52:55.756
like, one form of orgasm
is immature, another is mature.

52:55.791 --> 52:57.992
Which we've just
scientifically proved is not science.

52:58.026 --> 52:59.426
But there are other assumptions.

52:59.461 --> 53:00.728
For example,

53:00.762 --> 53:04.231
how long do elderly people
remain sexually active?

53:04.266 --> 53:08.035
Now, the general assumption is
that the course of a sex life

53:08.069 --> 53:09.503
ends around 60.

53:09.538 --> 53:12.373
But I've got two 70-year-olds
in Miami who are living proof

53:12.407 --> 53:14.608
that that's something
we should investigate.

53:14.643 --> 53:17.578
Here's another question...
Why can some women orgasm

53:17.612 --> 53:19.280
without any genital stimulation
whatsoever?

53:19.314 --> 53:21.582
- Can they?
- Jane can.

53:21.616 --> 53:24.084
Jane can orgasm
just having her breasts touched.

53:24.119 --> 53:25.686
That I find hard to believe.

53:25.720 --> 53:27.855
You don't have to
because we could test it here.

53:27.889 --> 53:28.889
Couldn't we?

53:28.924 --> 53:29.957
We could.

53:29.991 --> 53:31.325
There was a woman on the road

53:31.359 --> 53:33.494
who could orgasm by putting
a Q-tip in her ear.

53:33.528 --> 53:36.130
And there was a woman tonight
who wrote on her questionnaire

53:36.164 --> 53:38.666
that she can climax
while brushing her teeth.

53:38.700 --> 53:42.970
Sexual pleasure
via good hygiene? Okay.

53:43.004 --> 53:46.774
Men can climax in their dreams.

53:46.808 --> 53:49.877
Women can, too.

53:51.179 --> 53:53.247
So I think your
new job description is clear...

53:53.281 --> 53:56.183
Keep asking questions.

53:56.218 --> 53:59.220
That's what
a good researcher does.

54:02.858 --> 54:08.829
Although, orgasming
having your breasts touched...

54:08.864 --> 54:11.232
I'd need to see proof of that.

55:00.248 --> 55:01.649
We're scientists.

55:10.558 --> 55:11.558
Let's see.
