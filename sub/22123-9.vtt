17:32.355 --> 17:34.966
YOU GUYS GO TO PALI?
I'M TRANSFERRING THERE
IN THE FALL.

17:35.663 --> 17:36.968
-LIKE WE CARE.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.405
COME ON, GIRLS.
LET'S GO IN THE WATER.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.276

17:45.064 --> 17:46.500
-HI.
-HOW YOU DOING?

17:47.109 --> 17:48.893
-IS IT SAFE TO SWIM?

17:49.024 --> 17:51.592
-ABSOLUTELY.
JUST SWIM PARALLEL
TO THE SHORE

17:51.722 --> 17:53.202
AND DON'T GO OUT
TOO FAR, ALL RIGHT?

17:54.334 --> 17:56.771
-I GO FAR WHEN I GO OUT.
-YEAH, ALL THE WAY.

18:51.478 --> 18:53.262
-COME ON, SHAUNI,

18:53.393 --> 18:55.743
BE JEALOUS
OF THESE LITTLE
BEACH BUNNIES, HUH?

18:55.873 --> 18:58.920
-MAYBE BECAUSE I WENT
TO PALI AND I HUNG OUT
ON THIS BEACH.

18:59.050 --> 19:01.618
I KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE AFTER, EDDIE.
-OH YEAH? WHAT?

19:02.619 --> 19:04.926
-A TROPHY.
-YOU ALREADY WON IT!

19:05.448 --> 19:08.190
-THAT'S RIGHT, I DID--
AT 15, JUST LIKE THEM.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.018
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE LIFEGUARD WAS...

19:11.324 --> 19:12.629
NEVER MIND.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

19:13.282 --> 19:16.198
-WHO?
-NO, NO, NEVER MIND.
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.418
YOU KNOW HIM,
SO FORGET IT.
-WHO?

19:18.548 --> 19:19.941
MITCH? NEWMIE?
WHO WAS IT?

19:20.071 --> 19:21.421
-NEVER MIND.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.514
-SHAUNI, COVER MY BEACH.

20:16.911 --> 20:18.913

HANG ON.

20:30.446 --> 20:31.360
-IS SHE OKAY?

20:32.753 --> 20:33.928
-SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

20:34.929 --> 20:37.627
-HERE YOU GO. RIGHT HERE.

20:39.934 --> 20:42.458
WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO DO?
SWIM TO CATALINA?

20:43.024 --> 20:45.069
-I DIDN'T REALIZE
I WAS OUT SO FAR.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.549
-OH PLEASE.

20:47.724 --> 20:50.249
-ALL RIGHT.
HEY, I CAN HANDLE IT FROM HERE.

20:50.379 --> 20:51.902
WHY DON'T YOU
GO BACK TO YOUR TOWER?

20:52.033 --> 20:54.688
-YOU'D JUST BETTER DRY OFF
BEFORE YOU TARNISH.

20:57.952 --> 21:00.259
-WAS IT CORY?
IT WAS, WASN'T IT?

21:02.217 --> 21:03.349
IT WAS CORY.

21:07.614 --> 21:09.790
HEY, COME ON, GUYS.
LET'S GO, HUH? THE SHOW'S OVER.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.270

GO ON AND SURF. YEAH.

21:14.534 --> 21:17.319

21:17.450 --> 21:19.278
-MY LEG-- I GOT A CRAMP.

21:19.843 --> 21:22.455
LET'S JUST GET THE BLOOD
CIRCULATING IN THERE.
-OH NO.

21:22.977 --> 21:24.457
-HOW'S THAT?
FEELING BETTER?

21:25.240 --> 21:27.286
HUH? IS THAT BETTER?

21:27.851 --> 21:29.897
-YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

21:53.964 --> 21:55.792
-HEY! WHOA.

21:57.359 --> 22:00.797
TRYING TO KILL YOURSELF?
-NAW, JUST HITCHING A RIDE.

22:00.928 --> 22:02.930
-OH YEAH?
WHAT IF SOME KID
WITH A SKATEBOARD

22:03.060 --> 22:05.062
SAW YOU AND TRIED
TO FOLLOW YOUR EXAMPLE?

22:07.804 --> 22:08.675
-YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:08.805 --> 22:10.241
-UH-HUH.
-I'M SORRY, BEN.

22:11.155 --> 22:13.201
GO AHEAD, HIT ME AGAIN
WITH YOUR CANE. I DESERVE IT.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.986
-NO, I SHOULD'VE KICKED
SOME SENSE INTO YOU YEARS AGO.

22:19.294 --> 22:21.296
-TOO BAD THAT DORY
DIDN'T HIT ME ON THE HEAD.

22:21.992 --> 22:24.821
I'D BE FINE.
-YOU KNOW, FOR 60 YEARS,

22:24.952 --> 22:27.737
I'VE COUNTED
ON MY LEGS TO RUN ME
WHEREVER I WANTED TO GO.

22:28.434 --> 22:31.698
BUT EVER SINCE MY ACCIDENT,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED?

22:32.742 --> 22:36.224
-NO.
-AS LONG AS WHAT'S
IN HERE IS RUNNING,

22:36.355 --> 22:38.226
I CAN STILL GET
EVERYWHERE I WANNA GO.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.622
-YEAH, BEN, BUT WHAT IF
WHAT'S IN HERE IS BROKEN?

22:43.623 --> 22:44.580
-YOU GOTTA MEND IT, BOY.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.150
MEGAN'S WORKING
ABALONE COVE TODAY.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.632
NO HITCHHIKING, YOU.

22:52.762 --> 22:55.548
GO ON, GET OUT OF HERE.
-THANKS, BEN.

23:02.859 --> 23:03.860
-GOD.

23:23.097 --> 23:25.360
-HEY. FEELING BETTER?

23:25.969 --> 23:27.231
-THANKS, YEAH.

23:28.711 --> 23:30.583
THERE WAS SOME WEIRDO
UP BY THE BATHROOM.

23:31.627 --> 23:34.630
-REALLY? WELL, WAIT HERE, I'LL--
-OH NO, HE'S GONE NOW.

23:36.893 --> 23:39.026
I HAVE TO GET CHANGED
FOR WORK, AND I WAS WONDERING

23:39.156 --> 23:41.202
IF I COULD DO IT
IN YOUR TOWER.

23:43.030 --> 23:45.293
-NO, I'M SORRY.
LOOK, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--

23:45.424 --> 23:47.338
I'LL WALK YOU TO THE BATHROOM
AND MAKE SURE NOTHING
HAPPENS, ALL RIGHT?

23:47.469 --> 23:50.254
-NO, I REALLY DON'T WANNA
GO BACK UP THERE, BECAUSE...

23:51.168 --> 23:52.387
WELL, IT'S REALLY CREEPY.

23:52.909 --> 23:54.998
I'LL BE FAST. I PROMISE.

23:58.785 --> 24:01.440
-ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
MAKE IT SNAPPY. ALL RIGHT?

24:01.570 --> 24:03.050
-THANKS.
-COME ON.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.770
CAN YOU SEE
ALL RIGHT IN THERE?

24:28.597 --> 24:30.686
-ACTUALLY,
IT'S KIND OF DARK IN HERE.

24:31.513 --> 24:33.080
COULD YOU OPEN
THE DOOR A LITTLE?

24:37.563 --> 24:38.520
MY ZIPPER'S STUCK.

24:41.131 --> 24:43.307
-LISTEN, I--
-NO, REALLY, SEE?

24:49.183 --> 24:50.053
-ALL RIGHT.

24:52.055 --> 24:52.882
THERE YOU GO.

24:56.016 --> 24:57.800
-YOU CAN TAKE IT
OFF ME IF YOU WANT.

25:00.194 --> 25:01.717
-CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES
AND GET OUT.

25:01.848 --> 25:03.023
YOU'VE GOT 30 SECONDS.

25:03.937 --> 25:05.591
-BUT YOU SAVED ME.
YOU DESERVE IT.

25:05.721 --> 25:07.941
-YOU'RE NOT A PRIZE,
AND NEITHER AM I.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.035
-YES, YOU ARE.

25:29.658 --> 25:31.399
-HI, ROB. IT'S MEGAN.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.096
LOOK, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO CANCEL TONIGHT.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.534
I'LL CALL YOU THE BEGINNING
OF NEXT WEEK, OKAY?

25:36.056 --> 25:37.231
I'M SORRY. BYE.

25:44.891 --> 25:45.848
-YES!

26:01.168 --> 26:02.691
-I'VE GOT A HANG GLIDER
AT PALOS VERDES.

26:02.822 --> 26:04.954
BETTER GET A MOBILE UNIT
UP HERE A.S.A.P.

26:11.482 --> 26:14.311
-HEY, LIFEGUARD,
LET THE MAN FLY.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.751
-THE WIND SHIFTS,
AND HE FLIES INTO THE CLIFF.

26:18.881 --> 26:21.144
-HE'S ON THE THERMAL.
HE'LL BE FINE.

26:24.887 --> 26:25.758
COME HERE.

26:30.589 --> 26:33.156
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
WHEN WE USED TO HANG GLIDE
FROM UP THERE?

26:34.723 --> 26:36.377
-I MUST'VE BEEN CRAZY.

26:38.379 --> 26:39.598
-IN LOVE.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.731
YOU'D GO ANYWHERE
WITH ME THEN.

26:44.428 --> 26:46.605
-LIKE I SAID, I WAS CRAZY.

27:09.149 --> 27:10.716
EVERYBODY CAN SEE US.

27:11.281 --> 27:12.500
-I DON'T CARE.

27:13.719 --> 27:16.199
-WHAT IF CAPTAIN THORPE'S
LOOKING THROUGH HIS BINOCULARS?

27:17.853 --> 27:20.943
-SO? WE'LL GIVE HIM
THE THRILL OF HIS LIFE.

27:54.585 --> 27:55.935
-I WANNA BE WITH YOU.

27:57.719 --> 27:59.982
I WANNA BE WITH YOU
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
-YES.

28:09.209 --> 28:11.385
-COME ON, YOU GUYS, LET'S GO!

28:22.657 --> 28:25.007
-OKAY, I GOT IT!
-WHOO!

28:29.882 --> 28:31.710
-KEEP IT UP! COME ON!
-WHOO!

28:35.061 --> 28:36.627
-SPIKE IT! COME ON!

28:47.290 --> 28:48.596
-WHOO!
-GREAT SHOT!

28:48.727 --> 28:49.640
-HOW YOU DOING?

28:51.904 --> 28:54.167
I SEE THE BEACH IS
IN RARE FORM TODAY.

28:54.297 --> 28:55.951
-YEAH, IT'S A TOUGH JOB.

28:56.082 --> 28:57.779
WHAT'S GOING ON?
-RESCUE CARDS?

28:57.910 --> 28:58.867
-ON THE SHELF.

29:13.447 --> 29:14.448
-WHAT THE...?

29:25.720 --> 29:28.941
-[SIGHS]
SHE LEFT IT HERE.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

29:29.768 --> 29:30.769
-WHO?

29:32.422 --> 29:33.859
-GIRL I PULLED OUT YESTERDAY.

29:34.642 --> 29:36.296
-OF HER BATHING SUIT?
-OF THE WATER.

29:36.949 --> 29:38.820
-SHALL I READ HER RESCUE CARD
OR WAIT FOR THE NOVEL?

29:40.387 --> 29:43.085
-ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
SHE HAD TO CHANGE HER CLOTHES,

29:43.216 --> 29:46.175
THERE WAS A WEIRDO
HANGING OUT AT THE HEAD,
SO I LET HER USE THE TOWER.

29:46.306 --> 29:48.047
IT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN,
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

29:48.177 --> 29:49.526
-BE CAREFUL, BEACH BREATH,

29:50.266 --> 29:51.311
ESPECIALLY ON THIS BEACH.

29:51.441 --> 29:52.181
-GOT IT! OH!
-ALL RIGHT!

29:52.312 --> 29:53.966
-WHOO! GOOD ONE!

29:54.096 --> 29:56.011
-KEEP IT IN THE AIR!
-COME ON!

29:56.142 --> 29:56.925
-HI!

29:57.056 --> 29:58.187
-HI.

30:05.064 --> 30:08.589
-OFF THE RAMP.
-SORRY, GUESS I LEFT
MY BATHING SUIT IN YOUR TOWER.

30:09.938 --> 30:11.287
-GUESS YOU DID.
-YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

30:11.418 --> 30:13.594
-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
-I DON'T GET IT.

30:20.209 --> 30:22.472
I GOTTA CHECK THIS.

30:22.603 --> 30:24.126
SORRY, JENNA, BUT I WANNA FIND
OUT ALL THE SORDID DETAILS.
-YEAH, ME TOO.

30:24.257 --> 30:25.824
-NO, WAIT, YOU GUYS,
DON'T TALK TO HER.

30:25.954 --> 30:27.390
GUYS, COME BACK HERE!

30:31.917 --> 30:33.614
-HI.
-HI.

30:34.354 --> 30:35.921
-SO, HOW'D HE GET
YOUR BATHING SUIT?

30:36.051 --> 30:38.140
-I LEFT IT
IN HIS TOWER LAST NIGHT.

30:38.271 --> 30:41.100
I WAS SO OUT OF IT.
-OH, FROM ALMOST DROWNING?

30:42.318 --> 30:44.755
-FROM THE BEER.
WE MUST'VE CHUGGED
TWO SIX-PACKS.

30:46.757 --> 30:48.847
THEN WE HAD TO GO
SKINNY-DIPPING TO SOBER UP.

30:48.977 --> 30:51.675
-YOU SWAM NUDE WITH HIM?
-SOBER ENOUGH TO WHAT?

30:53.677 --> 30:56.202
-WELL, I CAN'T TELL YOU.
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS.

30:56.332 --> 30:57.812
-OH, SHE'S FULL OF IT.
LET'S GO.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.988
-SHUT UP.
-I'M KRIS, THIS IS JOANNIE.

31:00.119 --> 31:01.903
-COME ON,
TELL US EVERYTHING.

31:02.034 --> 31:04.732
THAT'S HOW
YOU BECOME FRIENDS.
NOW, WHAT HAPPENED?

31:07.778 --> 31:09.476
-WE MADE IT IN HIS TOWER.

31:10.912 --> 31:15.047
IT WAS SO ROMANTIC
WITH THE MOONLIGHT
AND THE WAVES.

31:15.177 --> 31:16.787
-OH MY GOSH!
-OH MY GOD.

31:20.574 --> 31:23.577
-I FELL ASLEEP IN HIS ARMS,
AND HE HELD ME ALL NIGHT.

31:26.275 --> 31:27.973
-OH MY GOSH.

31:29.017 --> 31:30.976
-GET IT.
-ALL RIGHT!

31:31.106 --> 31:31.977
-WHOO!

31:36.633 --> 31:39.201
-SAY, MITCH, YOU GOT A MINUTE?
-I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO HIT THE BEACH.

31:39.332 --> 31:41.900
-30 SECONDS.
-30 SECONDS, GO.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.033
-WHAT DO YOU THINK?

31:45.599 --> 31:47.688
-I THINK IT'LL MAKE SWIMMING
A LITTLE DIFFICULT.

31:47.818 --> 31:49.908
-BUT THE REST OF YOUR JOB
A WHOLE LOT SAFER.

31:50.038 --> 31:52.475
-THE DAY WE CARRY
ONE OF THESE IS THE DAY
WE LOSE THE PUBLIC'S TRUST.

31:52.606 --> 31:54.390
-BETTER TO LOSE
A LITTLE TRUST THAN YOUR LIVES.

31:55.043 --> 31:57.480
COME ON, MITCH,
IT'S NOT ALL FUN IN THE SUN
OUT THERE ANYMORE.

31:57.611 --> 31:59.830
YOU GOT GANGS,
VAGRANTS, DRUG DEALERS,

31:59.961 --> 32:02.181
AND YOU ALL RUNNING AROUND,
UNARMED, IN YOUR UNDERWEAR.

32:03.051 --> 32:05.924
-THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE POLICE.
-WHAT IF WE CAN'T GET
TO YOU IN TIME?

32:13.409 --> 32:14.410
-[GRUNTS]

32:15.411 --> 32:17.544
YOU GOT YOUR EQUIPMENT,
WE GOT OURS.

32:18.284 --> 32:21.765
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS
IT'S REALLY HARD TO FLOAT
A VICTIM ON A BILLY CLUB.

32:22.418 --> 32:23.942
-POINT MADE.
-THANK YOU.

32:28.772 --> 32:29.686
-WHAT'S WRONG?

32:32.559 --> 32:34.169
-GONNA KILL HIMSELF.
-WHO?

32:34.822 --> 32:36.432
-TURNER.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.957
HE'S GOT THAT BOOGIE BOARD
WITH HOBIE RIGHT NEXT
TO THE JETTY.

32:40.088 --> 32:43.135
HE'S NOT CAREFUL,
HE'S GONNA PILE HIS BUTT
RIGHT INTO THOSE ROCKS.

33:06.027 --> 33:08.725
-HOBIE! COME ON! COME ON!

33:19.345 --> 33:22.348
-DAD! DID YOU SEE TURNER?
HE PRACTICALLY TAGGED THE ROCKS!

33:22.478 --> 33:25.351
-YEAH, I SEE HIM.
DON'T YOU EVER TRY THAT.

33:25.481 --> 33:27.353
-I'M NOT CRAZY, DAD.
-MITCH!

33:28.006 --> 33:30.443
BETTER GET A SPATULA READY!

33:39.974 --> 33:41.889
-HANG ONTO THIS FOR ME.
-SURE.

34:16.576 --> 34:18.230
-OH, COME ON!

34:32.244 --> 34:35.072
-MITCH! COME ON!

34:40.643 --> 34:41.688
LET ME GO, DAMN IT!

34:43.342 --> 34:44.864
LET ME GO, MITCH!

34:45.431 --> 34:47.520
DAMN IT, EVERYONE'S WATCHING.
WILL YOU LET ME GO!

34:47.650 --> 34:49.913
-JUST LET ME GET YOU
TO YOUR CHAIR FIRST.
-JUST DROP ME!

34:50.523 --> 34:52.393
DAMN IT! DROP ME NOW!

34:54.396 --> 34:55.963
HOBIE, GIVE ME MY BOARD!

34:56.094 --> 34:57.791
-WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU TYING TO PROVE, ANYWAY?

34:57.921 --> 34:59.880
-WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PROVE?
THAT YOU'RE STILL A HERO?

35:00.881 --> 35:02.578
-NO.
-GIVE ME MY BOARD, HOBIE.

35:02.709 --> 35:04.102
-I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.

35:04.711 --> 35:08.236
-WELL, I DON'T NEED ANY HELP.
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP, MITCH.

35:08.367 --> 35:10.499
I DON'T NEED IT,
I DON'T WANT IT,

35:10.630 --> 35:13.285
GET OUT OF MY WAY!
-YOU DON'T NEED TO BE DOING
THIS KIND OF STUFF.

35:13.894 --> 35:15.896
-HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I NEED TO DO? HUH?

35:18.638 --> 35:20.205
THINK YOU KNOW EVERYTHING?

35:24.426 --> 35:26.689
