WEBVTT

00:41.780 --> 00:43.739
Does this mean
I've graduated

00:43.782 --> 00:48.265
to the next levelof kinky Whisperer shit?

00:48.309 --> 00:51.138
You joke
to hide your fear.

00:57.579 --> 01:01.017
You know, seems to meyou've been cut up enough.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.281
Begin.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.336
Again.

01:29.393 --> 01:30.829
Now you.

01:32.657 --> 01:36.226
Ah, does this meanwe're bonded for life?

01:36.270 --> 01:38.315
Depends.

01:41.188 --> 01:44.278
Aah.

01:49.848 --> 01:59.554
We are the end...

01:59.597 --> 02:04.559
of the world...

02:04.602 --> 02:10.565
We are the end...

02:10.608 --> 02:16.310
of the world...

02:16.353 --> 02:21.880
We are
the end of the world.

02:21.924 --> 02:29.149
We take them all.

02:29.192 --> 02:36.373
We take them all.

02:36.417 --> 02:42.640
We take them all.

02:42.684 --> 02:47.384
We take them all.

02:47.428 --> 02:52.346
We take them all.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.961
Stephanie: I counted three
last night.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.963
You?

03:45.007 --> 03:46.661
This music library
is about as helpful

03:46.704 --> 03:47.966
as sushi
on a carburetor.

03:48.010 --> 03:50.447
Said LP
seems to be M.I.A.

03:50.491 --> 03:52.710
You want me to hear it,
I think you should sing it.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.146
Just belt it,
baby.

03:54.190 --> 03:55.583
I will not.

03:55.626 --> 03:58.107
Only a fool would attemptsuch a song

03:58.150 --> 04:00.152
sans epicstring accompaniment.

04:00.196 --> 04:03.068
So how many, then?

04:06.768 --> 04:08.726
Yester-eve,I tallied a flea's tush shy

04:08.770 --> 04:12.339
of four astro projectilesplummeting to earth.

04:12.382 --> 04:14.428
So three
shooting stars.

04:14.471 --> 04:16.517
You're still up
by two.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.259
You better not be
counting satellites.

04:19.302 --> 04:20.347
Satellites?

04:20.390 --> 04:22.566
Yeah, I saw one
falling recently.

04:22.610 --> 04:25.265
Around sunset?

04:25.308 --> 04:28.180
Yeah,
around sunset.

04:28.224 --> 04:30.748
We're close.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.968
Only a few hundred miles

04:33.011 --> 04:35.275
per satellite's
visibility range.

04:37.407 --> 04:39.844
As promised,I have not spilled the beans

04:39.888 --> 04:41.977
on our audio rendezvous
to anyone.

04:42.020 --> 04:43.500
But, well,
said satellite

04:43.544 --> 04:45.415
provided the kickin the deuce-bucket required

04:45.459 --> 04:47.287
to tickle your ear drums
with this radio

04:47.330 --> 04:48.723
in the first place.

04:48.766 --> 04:50.507
I justcan't help but believe

04:50.551 --> 04:52.030
that this isa celestially ordained

04:52.074 --> 04:54.032
meet-and-greet.

04:54.076 --> 04:56.557
No bean-spillage here,
either.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.560
But my people
are uber cautious, Eugene.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.039
And if we're close...

05:01.083 --> 05:02.563
Virginia.

05:02.606 --> 05:05.043
I'm in Virginia.

05:09.570 --> 05:13.791
I'd like to proffera simple-as-ABC scenario

05:13.835 --> 05:16.794
as to how we cansafely face-to-face.

05:16.838 --> 05:19.580
You pick the dayand the neck of the woods.

05:19.623 --> 05:22.060
Perch yourself out of sight,
get the eyeball.

05:22.104 --> 05:24.062
You don't like
the cut of my jib,

05:24.106 --> 05:25.586
you adiÃ³syourself.

05:25.629 --> 05:27.109
Easy peasy.

05:29.590 --> 05:32.332
Truth is, Stephanie,

05:32.375 --> 05:35.596
I'd just very much
like to meet you.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.990
I'd really like
to meet you, too.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.427
Okay.

05:40.470 --> 05:41.558
I'll talk
to my people.

05:41.602 --> 05:43.343
And I'll do the same.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.606
No.
Don't tell anyone yet.

05:45.649 --> 05:48.304
Let's see
what my people say first.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.566
Will do, Waterloo.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.568
I promise.

06:08.455 --> 06:11.066
Who's that?

06:13.460 --> 06:16.506
Earl:
Never seen her before.

06:16.550 --> 06:19.161
Alexandria taking inanother stray?

06:19.204 --> 06:21.381
No, they gotta be
locked down.

06:21.424 --> 06:24.035
Well, they've brought 'emto us before.

06:33.436 --> 06:34.872
Hey. Hey!

06:34.916 --> 06:36.744
Who is that?

06:38.702 --> 06:40.661
Hi, Earl.
It's Mary.

06:40.704 --> 06:43.098
She, uh,
ran away from Alpha's camp.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.056
She's been
helping us out.

06:45.100 --> 06:48.146
What's she doing here?

06:48.190 --> 06:51.933
Her nephew
is, uh, Adam.

06:51.976 --> 06:53.500
She wants
to see him.

06:53.543 --> 06:54.936
No.

06:54.979 --> 06:56.938
Okay, Earl,
can we talk about this?

06:56.981 --> 06:58.418
You saidyou were gonna bring people

06:58.461 --> 06:59.680
who wanted
to see Alex --

06:59.723 --> 07:01.682
not one of our enemiesthat wants to see my son.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.988
She's not an enemy.You don't know that.

07:04.032 --> 07:05.425
You keep her away
from my kid.

07:06.730 --> 07:09.559
Earl. Earl.

07:11.256 --> 07:14.172
What the hell did he thinkI was gonna say?

07:14.216 --> 07:17.175
Those people left that kidout there to die.

07:17.219 --> 07:18.786
They see Alex,
and then they go.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.352
That's it.

07:20.396 --> 07:21.615
Just 'causethey came here wanting something

07:21.658 --> 07:22.964
doesn't mean
they're gonna get it.

07:23.007 --> 07:25.967
I'll handle it,
okay?

07:51.209 --> 07:53.516
How'd you find me?

07:55.039 --> 07:56.432
This was Daryl's place,right?

07:56.476 --> 08:00.523
I thought you neededsome comfort.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.307
Mm. I don't.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.660
Jerry and Kellymade it back to Hilltop.

08:06.703 --> 08:09.010
I heard what happened
at the cave.

08:09.053 --> 08:11.534
I was worried
about you.

08:17.322 --> 08:19.542
Come on back.

08:35.340 --> 08:39.649
Or I'll just sit herewith you, and...

08:39.693 --> 08:43.784
we'll get eatenby mosquitos together.

08:52.923 --> 08:54.621
Ah, Kel,
this is nuts.

08:54.664 --> 08:56.100
You can hardly walk.

08:56.144 --> 08:59.539
I'm not leaving my sisterout there.

08:59.582 --> 09:01.584
I'm going
with you guys.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.064
Miko,
help me out here.

09:03.107 --> 09:04.805
What was the last thing
Magna said to you?

09:04.848 --> 09:06.371
Why does it matter?

09:06.415 --> 09:07.764
We're getting 'em back.

09:07.808 --> 09:09.461
Yeah,
and what if we don't?

09:09.505 --> 09:11.028
You know?

09:11.072 --> 09:13.117
All we're ever gonna know
is that damn ceiling caved in.

09:13.161 --> 09:15.032
If you think
that they're dead,

09:15.076 --> 09:16.643
why are you
coming with us?

09:25.695 --> 09:27.697
Any sign of them?

09:27.741 --> 09:29.090
We didn't get
that far.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.396
What do you mean?
What happened?

09:31.440 --> 09:32.789
We gotta talk.

09:32.833 --> 09:33.877
Luke:
D, I'm sorry.

09:33.921 --> 09:35.836
We gotta find
our people, man.

09:35.879 --> 09:38.621
No.
You can't go out there.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.580
My mother's coming.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.631
Eugene?

09:53.680 --> 09:55.682
Stephanie: Blue Weevil
to Tater Bug...

09:55.725 --> 09:58.293
one more question
about that satellite.

09:58.336 --> 09:59.686
Hello?

09:59.729 --> 10:02.689
Who is this?

10:02.732 --> 10:04.647
Eugene: No. No!Anyone there?

10:04.691 --> 10:06.344
Who is th-- Hello?Go away. Go away.

10:06.388 --> 10:07.650
Come in.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.130
What?
Stephanie!

10:09.173 --> 10:10.958
Stephanie!

10:11.001 --> 10:12.916
Stephanie?!

10:14.614 --> 10:16.790
Is somebody getting actionat Oceanside?

10:16.833 --> 10:18.705
You need to go.
Now.

10:20.794 --> 10:23.405
You look terrible.

10:24.798 --> 10:27.670
Yeah, a giant Whisperertook a swipe at me.

10:27.714 --> 10:29.019
I'm fine, thanks.

10:29.063 --> 10:30.847
W-What's up your butt?

10:30.891 --> 10:34.590
She trusted me to keep our chatsmano-a-mano, and you...

10:34.634 --> 10:36.897
You just made me
break my promise.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.422
Now, go...

10:40.465 --> 10:43.643
before I say something
I truly regret.

10:55.045 --> 11:01.443
Blue Weevil, uh, that was
a mistake, a terrible mistake.

11:03.706 --> 11:06.709
I'm -- I'm sorry.

11:06.753 --> 11:10.191
Blue Weevil,
do you copy, please?

11:13.716 --> 11:17.459
Negan: Got a little
unsolicited advice --

11:17.502 --> 11:20.505
everyone's favorite kind,
I know,

11:20.549 --> 11:22.812
but I can't
help myself.

11:22.856 --> 11:26.773
And maybe I thought of an idea
that you haven't yet.

11:26.816 --> 11:29.993
I respect
a well-deserved massacre.

11:30.037 --> 11:32.779
Some people --
they just have it coming.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.346
And I get why
you want to take out

11:35.390 --> 11:36.826
Hilltop and Alexandria.

11:36.870 --> 11:41.526
It would just --
It would feel good.

11:41.570 --> 11:46.488
But you know what might feel
goddamn fantastic?

11:46.531 --> 11:50.535
Getting those assholes
to surrender,

11:50.579 --> 11:53.277
bend a knee.

11:53.321 --> 11:57.760
Alpha, we can get them
to join us.

11:57.804 --> 12:00.284
Alpha: Explain.

12:02.330 --> 12:03.810
Eyes open.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.768
Any sign of a horde approach
or Whisperer movement,

12:05.812 --> 12:07.030
you radio us immediately.

12:07.074 --> 12:08.553
Be safe.

12:08.597 --> 12:09.816
Lydia: You heard themout there.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.339
We have to go.

12:11.382 --> 12:14.037
Even if you took outhalf the herd in that cave,

12:14.081 --> 12:15.604
she's got
thousands left.

12:15.647 --> 12:16.953
You can't stay here.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.825
The skins could march
straight to Alexandria

12:18.868 --> 12:20.174
for all we know.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.871
Daryl: Yeah,
we're right in their way.

12:21.915 --> 12:23.133
Maybe she goes
around us.

12:23.177 --> 12:24.874
She doesn't need
to go around you.

12:24.918 --> 12:27.007
She'll just
run through you.

12:27.050 --> 12:28.399
Jerry: I'm not
running again.

12:28.443 --> 12:30.314
Hell, no.
Dianne:
Lydia's right.

12:30.358 --> 12:31.620
We can
rebuild anywhere.

12:31.663 --> 12:32.969
Come on.
We can't.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.971
How many scouting missions
you been on, son?

12:35.015 --> 12:36.146
Hundreds?

12:36.190 --> 12:39.323
Have you ever seena place like Hilltop?

12:39.367 --> 12:41.195
Aaron:
No.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.764
We have a few dozen
able-bodied fighters here.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.026
Maybe.

12:46.069 --> 12:47.288
You like those odds?

12:47.331 --> 12:49.072
'Cause I don't.Neither do I.

12:49.116 --> 12:51.074
Now, we don't
have to die here.

12:51.118 --> 12:53.207
We're going to
have to fight,

12:53.250 --> 12:54.817
and if we die,

12:54.861 --> 12:57.602
we die fighting for a placethat means something.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.561
Can you think of
a better way to go?

12:59.604 --> 13:00.954
Yeah.

13:00.997 --> 13:03.826
We go with
my daughter's life intact.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.916
And Judith's
and Ezra's and Adam's.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.918
You want me
to keep going?

13:08.962 --> 13:11.878
Alright,
let's get the kids out first.

13:11.921 --> 13:14.794
Everybody, pack up.
We're going to Oceanside.

13:14.837 --> 13:17.884
Grab weapons, food --
whatever you can.

13:17.927 --> 13:20.625
We'll regroup there.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.026
Daryl...

13:30.070 --> 13:31.854
I wanna fight.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.638
I know you do.
Don't argue.

13:33.682 --> 13:34.944
RJ, come on.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.253
Come on.

14:21.991 --> 14:24.646
Felix and Penny.

14:26.039 --> 14:28.606
All the roads are gonna be
like this now.

14:31.174 --> 14:33.524
We ain't getting through.

14:33.568 --> 14:34.917
It's Negan.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.921
He's with her now.

14:42.490 --> 14:44.100
Gracie: Dad!

14:44.144 --> 14:46.189
Gracie?!

14:46.233 --> 14:48.713
Hey, hey.

14:53.196 --> 14:56.199
Go.
Go inside.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.944
What happened?

15:01.988 --> 15:03.424
Daryl: She blocked
all the roads.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.208
Means they're closing inon us.

15:05.252 --> 15:06.949
If we had a window to get out,we just missed it.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.995
But we can't stay here.

15:09.038 --> 15:11.127
You said --

15:11.171 --> 15:16.219
you all said --
we can't stay here.

15:16.263 --> 15:18.134
We can -- We can
call Alexandria, right?

15:18.178 --> 15:20.006
Call Alexandria,
and w--

15:20.049 --> 15:21.746
they'll get
fresh fighters here, right?

15:21.790 --> 15:24.140
And -- And --
And it's not just gonna be us.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.142
It's not gonna be
just us, right?

15:26.186 --> 15:27.491
Oceanside can't get here.

15:27.535 --> 15:29.145
Alexandria, either.
Not in time.

15:29.189 --> 15:31.365
Not after
what happened.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.671
We're on our own.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.978
Earl: Divvy up
your arsenals.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.937
We got catapults
up on the walls.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.112
And a damn good militia.

15:40.809 --> 15:42.811
This is what you've all
been practicing for.

15:42.854 --> 15:45.248
Come on, now, people!

15:45.292 --> 15:49.557
Do whatever you need
to get your heads on straight!

15:49.600 --> 15:52.081
This is gonna be
the fight of our lives.

16:25.158 --> 16:27.899
Hey.

16:27.943 --> 16:29.684
Hey.

16:49.182 --> 16:51.967
It's nothing.

16:56.189 --> 16:58.887
Never bullshit
a bullshitter.

17:07.939 --> 17:10.246
I wanted
to tell you.

18:01.732 --> 18:03.169
Alden: Hey.

18:03.212 --> 18:04.953
What do you think
you're doing?

18:04.996 --> 18:06.998
I'm going to say helloto my nephew.

18:07.042 --> 18:08.304
Please.

18:08.348 --> 18:09.436
Alpha could come
in any second.

18:09.479 --> 18:11.264
And whose fault's that,
huh?

18:11.307 --> 18:13.353
Hey.

18:13.396 --> 18:16.356
I hate them, too.What's going on here?

18:16.399 --> 18:19.185
She's not
supposed to be here.

18:19.228 --> 18:21.187
Alden...
she's not gonna hurt him.

18:21.230 --> 18:23.319
Do you really wanna fight
about this right now?Yeah, I do.

18:23.363 --> 18:27.193
Earl's a better father
than mine was.

18:27.236 --> 18:29.978
And we lost Tammy,
and then I lost...

18:30.021 --> 18:32.372
And he's been
raising that boy alone.

18:32.415 --> 18:33.590
For her.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.331
And for us.
Not for you. He's not yours.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.898
He'll never be.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.508
And you think
I'm picking a fight?

18:38.552 --> 18:40.162
Think I'm
being unreasonable?

18:40.206 --> 18:42.469
If I die tonight,
it'll have been for

18:42.512 --> 18:45.341
everything we've been tryingto build for him!

18:45.385 --> 18:47.213
Hey, buddy.

18:53.784 --> 18:55.960
That was fun.

18:56.004 --> 18:58.049
That was never
our problem.

18:58.093 --> 18:59.790
Ezekiel:
I'll take it.

18:59.834 --> 19:03.272
Remembered fondly
for something.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.275
Nothing?

19:06.319 --> 19:09.583
Not even
an eye roll?

19:13.064 --> 19:16.024
You've changed.

19:16.067 --> 19:19.288
Lost your
sense of humor.

19:19.332 --> 19:22.117
No, I haven't.

19:23.336 --> 19:26.774
I left it on a dresser
in the Kingdom,

19:26.817 --> 19:28.210
and then
it burned down.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.648
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

19:31.692 --> 19:34.173
I left my pride
sitting up there, too.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.219
I always hatedthat stupid dresser, anyway.

19:50.885 --> 19:53.409
Would this
have happened if...

19:53.453 --> 19:55.672
it was
any other night?

19:55.716 --> 19:57.892
What do you mean?

20:02.853 --> 20:05.639
If we didn't think
we were gonna die tonight.

20:07.336 --> 20:10.905
Wait.We're gonna die tonight?

20:36.583 --> 20:38.149
Ooph.

20:38.193 --> 20:41.152
I talked to Gabriel.

20:42.937 --> 20:45.896
Coco's fine.
I just --

20:45.940 --> 20:50.161
I worry about
how close Beta got to her.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.428
You tell him about
the horde?

20:55.471 --> 20:56.907
Hell, no.

20:56.951 --> 20:59.997
No, he'd...

21:02.478 --> 21:04.175
I'll tell him
when I see them again.

21:04.219 --> 21:06.569
Well, probability tiltsfirmly towards our demise,

21:06.613 --> 21:09.833
so,
strictly speaking --
Eugene.

21:11.226 --> 21:14.403
Thought I'd see you
up there,

21:14.447 --> 21:16.231
working on the radio.

21:17.450 --> 21:21.280
I ceased transmissions.

21:34.249 --> 21:37.687
You like this girl,
huh?

21:37.731 --> 21:41.691
Seems forgiveness of yourfaux pas is not in her vocab,

21:41.735 --> 21:44.694
as such, which leaves mewith the unpleasant conclusion

21:44.738 --> 21:47.480
that she finds me unworthyof her further attentions,

21:47.523 --> 21:49.351
confirming what
I've already known

21:49.395 --> 21:50.961
and what's oftbeen repeated to me.

21:51.005 --> 21:53.964
Who cares
what other people think?

21:56.532 --> 21:58.273
Eugene.

21:58.317 --> 22:02.233
How'd you know me this long
and you have no game?

22:02.277 --> 22:03.539
You been talking to that girl
on the radio

22:03.583 --> 22:05.541
long enough for that room
to turn into a dump.

22:05.585 --> 22:08.457
She likes you.

22:15.551 --> 22:18.728
Do you wanna kiss me?

22:23.516 --> 22:25.735
Come on, kiss me.

22:25.779 --> 22:28.825
And hurry
before I change my damn mind.

22:55.809 --> 22:57.332
It's a special
kind of peculiar

22:57.376 --> 22:59.203
to hanker for a kissfrom someone you've never met,

22:59.247 --> 23:00.466
isn't it?

23:00.509 --> 23:03.860
Wow.

23:03.904 --> 23:06.515
I know.

23:06.559 --> 23:08.038
This is not the time

23:08.082 --> 23:10.301
to be mulling mattersof a forlorn heart.

23:10.345 --> 23:11.781
Awesome.

23:11.825 --> 23:13.304
Well, that's what we'll put
on your gravestone.

23:13.348 --> 23:15.568
"Loser with
a forlorn heart."

23:20.573 --> 23:24.315
No, we can't give them
what they want.

23:24.359 --> 23:28.450
Those skin freaks would love
if we just rolled over.

23:28.494 --> 23:32.802
Screw that,
and screw them.

23:32.846 --> 23:35.849
Well,
you like this girl.

23:37.590 --> 23:40.070
So get off your ass
and go get her.

24:44.657 --> 24:47.224
You should hate me.

24:50.227 --> 24:52.926
It's hard...

24:52.969 --> 24:56.843
when you seemto hate yourself so much.

24:58.235 --> 25:00.673
I'm gonna kill her.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.808
That won't save us.

25:11.727 --> 25:14.513
But it'll feel good.

25:15.992 --> 25:18.734
Will you hate me then?

25:18.778 --> 25:21.781
I won't be
thinking about you.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.744
Thanks.

25:28.788 --> 25:32.226
Thanks for
telling the truth.

25:39.538 --> 25:42.062
People don't knowhow to do that anymore.

25:47.807 --> 25:50.592
"I'm sorry your kid diedand you hate the world."

25:54.770 --> 25:57.251
"Sorry your mother
is a monster."

26:01.647 --> 26:09.002
So they stay away...

26:09.045 --> 26:11.744
and let you
feel lonely.

26:21.797 --> 26:25.584
I had a whole life.

26:29.065 --> 26:31.894
I remember.

27:04.100 --> 27:06.799
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:06.842 --> 27:08.583
It's good. It's good. It's good.It's good. It's good.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.064
Hey.
Good.

27:11.107 --> 27:12.587
I'm sorry.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.155
I'm an asshole --

27:20.377 --> 27:21.857
We're gonna win this,

27:21.901 --> 27:25.426
and we're gonna
get them back here.

27:25.469 --> 27:28.690
'Cause assholes
get shit done.

27:36.742 --> 27:39.701
Gross.What is that?

27:43.009 --> 27:44.619
Tell everyone
to gather up.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.361
The horde's coming!

28:01.941 --> 28:06.641
âª Have you heard what they saidon the news today? âª

28:06.685 --> 28:09.949
âª Have you heard
what is coming to us all? âª

28:12.691 --> 28:17.652
âª That the world as we know it
will be coming to an end âª

28:17.696 --> 28:19.915
âª Have you heard?

28:19.959 --> 28:23.876
âª Have you heard?

28:23.919 --> 28:29.925
âª He sees them in the distancewhen the darkened clouds roll âª

28:29.969 --> 28:36.149
âª He could feel tension
in the atmosphere âª

28:36.192 --> 28:41.676
âª He would look in the mirror,
see an old man now âª

28:41.720 --> 28:42.982
It was Henry's.

28:43.025 --> 28:44.026
âª Does it matter?

28:44.070 --> 28:47.943
âª They survive somehow

28:47.987 --> 28:53.427
âª They said there's nothing canbe done about the situation âª

28:53.470 --> 28:54.950
Daito?

28:54.994 --> 28:57.692
Come in, daito.

28:57.736 --> 29:03.916
âª They said there's nothing
you can do at all âª

29:05.482 --> 29:09.617
âª To sit and wait around
for something to occur âª

29:09.660 --> 29:12.925
âª Did you know?

29:12.968 --> 29:15.231
âª Did you know?

29:27.026 --> 29:31.508
Stephanie: âª As he stares
across the garden looking
at the meadows âª

29:31.552 --> 29:35.991
âª Wonders if they'll ever
grow again âª

29:36.035 --> 29:40.517
âª The desperation of
the situation getting graver âª

29:40.561 --> 29:44.783
âª Getting ready
when the wild wind blows âª

29:45.958 --> 29:48.874
Told you
to just sing it.

29:48.917 --> 29:51.050
You got nice chops.

29:51.093 --> 29:53.879
Singing chops,
that is.

29:55.315 --> 29:57.534
I'm sorry
for disappearing.

29:57.578 --> 29:59.493
I...
freaked a little bit.

29:59.536 --> 30:01.408
Onus falls
squarely on me.

30:01.451 --> 30:03.018
I-I let my guard down.

30:03.062 --> 30:05.281
I apologize.

30:05.325 --> 30:07.066
So...

30:07.109 --> 30:11.070
who was the girl?

30:13.594 --> 30:17.816
Oh.
Oh, that's Rosita.

30:17.859 --> 30:21.820
I can
hear you smiling.

30:21.863 --> 30:25.562
You must be
fond of her.

30:27.347 --> 30:29.305
Why, yes.

30:29.349 --> 30:31.830
Very.

30:31.873 --> 30:37.052
She is
my proverbial BFF.

30:37.096 --> 30:40.577
And at the risk
of seeming forward,

30:40.621 --> 30:42.057
I sincerely hope

30:42.101 --> 30:43.885
you will get the chanceto meet her someday.

30:46.148 --> 30:48.020
I hope so, too.

30:54.374 --> 30:55.984
I don't know

30:56.028 --> 30:57.203
when the next time we'll be ableto heart-to-heart is,

30:57.246 --> 30:58.857
but I just wanted
to let you know

30:58.900 --> 31:01.381
that the last few dayshave been incredible.

31:03.035 --> 31:04.166
Charleston,
West Virginia.

31:04.210 --> 31:05.689
Southern Rail yards.

31:05.733 --> 31:06.995
About a mile south
of the Kanawha River.

31:07.039 --> 31:08.344
One week.

31:08.388 --> 31:11.347
Can you be there?

31:11.391 --> 31:15.090
Eugene?
You there?
Yes.

31:15.134 --> 31:16.962
I will be there...

31:17.005 --> 31:18.137
not square.

31:18.180 --> 31:21.880
This is Tater Bug,
over and out.

31:21.923 --> 31:23.620
Over and out.

31:25.971 --> 31:30.366
Eugene.
You ready or what?

31:32.151 --> 31:34.893
Let's get this
over with.

31:34.936 --> 31:37.373
I got a date.

31:49.168 --> 31:52.127
Hi.

31:52.171 --> 31:55.000
Here we go.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.962
You okay?

32:01.006 --> 32:04.139
No.
I got cancer.

32:04.183 --> 32:06.402
But that's okay.

32:06.446 --> 32:07.882
You know
what I'm sayin'?

32:09.231 --> 32:11.320
Yeah.I'm sorry about that.

32:13.975 --> 32:16.673
Look,
you and I, uh --

32:16.717 --> 32:20.286
we never really had muchto say to each other.

32:20.329 --> 32:22.157
But that doesn't meanI don't know

32:22.201 --> 32:24.855
all the thingsyou've been through.

32:24.899 --> 32:27.032
You're stronger
than most,

32:27.075 --> 32:29.686
and there'sa whole lot of people here

32:29.730 --> 32:31.950
real glad about that.

32:31.993 --> 32:34.517
I am, too.

32:34.561 --> 32:37.216
Thanks, man.

32:37.259 --> 32:40.001
That means a lot.

32:40.045 --> 32:41.350
Yeah.

32:41.394 --> 32:43.962
Things are gonna getreal bad around here.

32:44.005 --> 32:47.139
I just want to knowthat the kids are alright.

32:47.182 --> 32:51.708
If things go sideways,or you or I go down...

32:51.752 --> 32:54.146
The other
gets the children out.

32:55.277 --> 32:56.975
You good with that?

33:03.024 --> 33:05.722
Alright.

33:15.776 --> 33:18.692
Hi.

33:18.735 --> 33:22.130
You should be
with the other kids.

33:22.174 --> 33:23.784
I wanna help.

33:23.827 --> 33:25.046
I can fight.

33:25.090 --> 33:26.917
I know you can.

33:26.961 --> 33:28.484
I'm sorry about today.

33:28.528 --> 33:31.400
You didn't need to see
those bodies like that.

33:31.444 --> 33:33.185
They were just walkers.

33:33.228 --> 33:35.274
I've killed
plenty of walkers.

33:35.317 --> 33:36.753
I know.

33:36.797 --> 33:38.059
But they weren't
just walkers.

33:39.756 --> 33:42.020
I'm not scared.

33:42.063 --> 33:44.152
I know you're not.

33:44.196 --> 33:47.199
Maybe I am,
a little bit.

33:49.375 --> 33:52.552
If I was scared,

33:52.595 --> 33:56.251
maybe I'd be scared for RJbecause he's so little.

33:57.644 --> 33:59.298
Yeah.
I get that.

33:59.341 --> 34:02.083
Maybe I'd be worriedabout my mom.

34:02.127 --> 34:04.868
Maybe I'd be scared
that you'd get hurt

34:04.912 --> 34:07.567
and I'd lose you.

34:07.610 --> 34:09.569
And Aunt Carol, too.

34:09.612 --> 34:12.398
There ain't no shame
in that.

34:12.441 --> 34:14.791
You know
who you're fighting for.

34:21.407 --> 34:24.105
I made you something.

34:24.149 --> 34:26.064
It's for luck.

34:26.107 --> 34:27.326
No way.

34:27.369 --> 34:29.850
I love it.

34:31.895 --> 34:33.114
How do I look?

34:33.158 --> 34:34.724
It looks good.

34:37.379 --> 34:40.600
There's one other thing.

34:42.167 --> 34:43.385
If,
during the fight,

34:43.429 --> 34:46.345
Ezekiel comes looking
for you and RJ,

34:46.388 --> 34:47.607
you go with him,

34:47.650 --> 34:49.652
whether you know
where I am or not.

34:49.696 --> 34:51.393
Okay?

34:51.437 --> 34:53.134
Hey.

34:53.178 --> 34:56.355
You gotta promise me.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.445
I promise.

36:08.514 --> 36:11.212
Now, please don't hate me.

36:23.355 --> 36:25.966
I'm never
gonna hate you.

38:32.919 --> 38:36.357
Formation!

40:00.441 --> 40:01.790
They're splitting
into two!

40:01.834 --> 40:04.271
They're gonna load up!

40:04.314 --> 40:07.492
On my command,
splitting ranks!

40:07.535 --> 40:10.190
And...break!

41:31.967 --> 41:36.668
Man: The fence
isn't gonna hold!

42:22.627 --> 42:25.325
Smells like
a Christmas tree!

42:37.816 --> 42:39.339
It's like gasoline!

42:55.703 --> 42:59.664
I thought you wanted them
to join us.

42:59.707 --> 43:02.841
They will.

43:02.884 --> 43:05.974
As part of my horde.

43:06.018 --> 43:08.455
Holy shit...

43:08.498 --> 43:10.805
you are a badass.

43:12.720 --> 43:15.636
Get ready
to fall back!

43:17.333 --> 43:20.032
Back inside!
Come on!

43:20.075 --> 43:22.034
Come on!
Retreat!

43:22.077 --> 43:24.819
Go, go, go!

43:24.863 --> 43:26.560
Come on! Go!

43:26.604 --> 43:28.214
Let's move!

43:37.049 --> 43:38.441
Come on!

43:38.485 --> 43:40.748
They're already dead!
Let's go!

43:45.753 --> 43:49.670
Back! Fall back!

43:49.714 --> 43:52.151
Let them break through!Move!
