It's really only recently that I've
been able to admit it to myself.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.063
Because I've gotten so good at watching
and imitating other people's emotions

A puntilla.

46:36.919 --> 46:38.125
Kinda.

46:41.048 --> 46:45.417
It stopped the convulsions, but the
problem with puntilla execution

46:45.511 --> 46:48.253
is it doesn't actually kill the
horse, it just paralyzes them.

46:50.057 --> 46:52.549

for Honeymooner.
