- [neighbor] Hey, you okay in there?

14:51.000 --> 14:55.750
Open up! Hey, if you don't open the door,
I'm gonna call the cops!

15:06.667 --> 15:08.750
- Nice work, kid.
- [Loretta chuckles]

[announcer on radio] <i>The city is buzzing
today after a story in the</i> Record American

15:14.917 --> 15:18.833
<i>claims that three elderly women were
killed by one deranged individual.</i>

15:18.833 --> 15:21.750
There's nothing in the <i>Globe</i>
or the <i>Herald</i>.

15:23.875 --> 15:24.875
Or any of 'em.

15:26.667 --> 15:28.083
You beat the whole damn city.

15:30.208 --> 15:31.917
I can't believe it. This is incredible!

15:35.250 --> 15:36.917
The story's bullshit.

15:36.917 --> 15:39.833
Been getting calls all morning
from my guys in the department.

15:39.833 --> 15:42.125
- [buzzer sounds]
- [Phyllis] <i>DA's office for you.</i>

15:42.125 --> 15:43.833
Hold my calls, please.

15:43.833 --> 15:45.417
[Corsetti] She's in way over her head.

15:45.417 --> 15:47.708
- You never should've sent her out on this.
- [buzzer sounds]

15:47.708 --> 15:49.833
[Phyllis]
<i>I have Commissioner McNamara for you.</i>

15:49.833 --> 15:51.542
I told you to hold my calls.

15:51.542 --> 15:54.125
<i>No, he's here for you.</i>

15:54.125 --> 15:55.250
Jesus Christ.

15:55.250 --> 15:56.833
Fuck 'em.

15:58.708 --> 15:59.875
Send him in.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.208
[drink pours]

16:04.542 --> 16:06.542
Ah, what can I do for you, Commissioner?

16:09.167 --> 16:12.375
Was it your idea to send some skirt
down to the station house?

16:12.375 --> 16:14.958
Well, her name's Loretta.
She was workin' a story.

16:14.958 --> 16:16.792
Is that what you're callin' it now?

16:17.917 --> 16:20.583
Hanging around the bar,
flirtin' with my guys?

16:20.583 --> 16:23.417
Never even identified herself
as a reporter.

16:23.417 --> 16:27.708
Now I've got every old lady in
the fuckin' city tying up my phone lines!

16:27.708 --> 16:30.458
Just tell me what we got wrong,
and I'll print a correction.

16:30.458 --> 16:32.458
It's barstool gossip, for Christ's sake!

16:32.458 --> 16:35.333
Half the news in the city's
barstool gossip.

16:35.333 --> 16:36.833
What the hell did we get wrong?

16:36.833 --> 16:40.167
Homicide has been workin'
around the clock on this,

16:40.167 --> 16:42.167
and we've got nothin'
to connect the murders.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.833
What about the stockings?

16:43.833 --> 16:45.625
Only one of the victims in Boston
had that.

16:45.625 --> 16:47.125
The other one looks like a suicide.

16:47.125 --> 16:50.125
- We got sources for both women--
- Sources!

16:50.125 --> 16:54.708
It was a couple of dipshit beat cops
trying to bed that girl you sent down!

16:56.208 --> 16:58.250
I'm telling you this as a friend.

16:58.250 --> 17:01.833
If you keep running this story,
you're gonna end up embarrassing yourself.

17:04.333 --> 17:08.375
- [chattering]
- [phone ringing]

17:09.917 --> 17:10.958
[Jack] Loretta!

17:24.167 --> 17:25.250
Shut the door.

17:29.458 --> 17:32.667
I am catching hell over this story.

17:32.667 --> 17:35.125
Now, Commissioner McNamara
says the whole thing's gossip.

17:35.125 --> 17:36.458
Same with Corsetti's sources.

17:36.458 --> 17:38.500
I confirmed every word of that story.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.375
You identified yourself as a reporter?

17:40.375 --> 17:41.708
Of course I did.

17:41.708 --> 17:44.083
- Even at the bar?
- Especially at the bar.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.833
I'm killin' the follow-up.

17:49.208 --> 17:52.458
We beat everyone in the whole damn city,
and you're-- you're just gonna drop it?

17:52.458 --> 17:53.583
Yes, I am.

17:53.583 --> 17:55.125
The story is good.

17:55.125 --> 17:57.125
The story is a headache
I don't need right now.

17:58.042 --> 18:00.292
And you're back on the lifestyle desk.

18:24.583 --> 18:26.417
[Kelly]
She shouldn't be working like this.

18:26.417 --> 18:28.042
[Loretta's husband] Oh, come on, Kelly.

18:28.042 --> 18:30.125
[Kelly] She should be home
taking care of her own husband.

18:30.125 --> 18:31.958
[Loretta's husband]
You check in a few hours a day.

18:31.958 --> 18:33.583
It's not the worst thing in the world.

18:33.583 --> 18:35.667
[Kelly speaking, indistinct]

18:37.083 --> 18:39.000
[Kelly] You don't see how selfish it is?

18:39.000 --> 18:41.208
[Loretta's husband] What do you
want me to say? We make it work.

18:41.208 --> 18:43.042
[Kelly] Yeah, 'cause I watch your kids
half the week.

18:43.042 --> 18:44.625
[Loretta's husband]
I appreciate your help--

18:44.625 --> 18:46.542
[Kelly] She's going to ruin your children.

18:48.708 --> 18:49.708
Hi, Kelly.

18:50.625 --> 18:51.917
Hi, Loretta.

18:51.917 --> 18:54.417
He offer you anything? Coffee? Tea?

18:54.417 --> 18:56.167
I was just headin' out.

18:57.375 --> 19:00.333
Tommy had a meltdown in the car.
Gave Patrick a fat lip.

19:00.333 --> 19:04.000
Class pictures are tomorrow.
Might wanna ice it again.

19:05.917 --> 19:07.208
Thank you.

19:27.875 --> 19:31.542
[melancholic singing on the radio]

19:35.458 --> 19:37.292
So, why haven't you asked me to stay home?

19:38.792 --> 19:39.917
'Cause I know better.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.917
No, I'm serious. Why not?

19:42.833 --> 19:44.000
'Cause you'd be miserable.

19:45.417 --> 19:46.500
Well, so what?

19:47.292 --> 19:51.083
Our lives would be easier.
Kids would be better off.

19:51.750 --> 19:53.333
- Says who?
- Your sister.

19:55.083 --> 19:56.625
My mother. The neighbor.

19:56.625 --> 19:57.958
What the hell do they know?

19:59.417 --> 20:02.083
You'd drive us all mad
if you were sittin' around here all day.

20:02.083 --> 20:03.167
[chuckles]

20:05.667 --> 20:06.750
It was a great story.

20:09.958 --> 20:13.458
Jack's probably just afraid to rock
the boat. Don't take it personally.

- Go.

- You'll get the kids off to school?
- Yeah, yeah. Go.

22:35.583 --> 22:36.875
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

He's using you. Putting a girl
on a story like that. It's a stunt.

Oh, uh, no offense,
but I-I don't need any help with this.

See what you come up with.

23:55.917 --> 23:59.250
[Jean] I already did.
Police aren't talking. Corsetti tried too.

Never seen 'em this tight-lipped
about anything.

27:11.958 --> 27:15.000
I wanted to ask you a few questions.
You mind openin' the door?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.250
[neighbor] You have ID?

27:19.208 --> 27:20.583
How do I know that's real?

27:20.583 --> 27:24.000
Ma'am, I'm a-- I'm a homicide detective
for the Boston Police Department.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.042
Yeah, well, I haven't met ya.
And I'm not letting strangers in.

27:27.042 --> 27:29.292
All right, let's go. Gotta wait outside.

27:29.292 --> 27:31.583
- No, I'm with the <i>Record American</i>.
- Doesn't matter. Let's go.

27:32.542 --> 27:33.875
[crowd clamoring]

27:33.875 --> 27:36.375
- [officer] People, please step back.
- [onlooker 1] What's the big deal?

27:36.375 --> 27:39.083
- [onlooker 2] What's going on here?
- [officer] Back up. Make some space.

27:39.083 --> 27:41.167
- They're not letting anyone in.
- [Jean] Come on.

27:45.417 --> 27:46.458
Hey, Joe.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.042
Hey, Jeanie. How are ya?

27:48.042 --> 27:50.042
- How's the old man doin'?
- He's still goin'.

27:50.583 --> 27:52.917
Any word on this?
It lookin' like the others?

27:52.917 --> 27:56.500
Yeah. Left her on the bed,
stockings tied around her neck.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.125
Did it look like he broke in?

27:58.125 --> 28:02.208
No. No sign of forced entry.
Looks like he took his time too.

28:03.792 --> 28:07.208
- [chattering]

28:07.208 --> 28:08.708
[Phyllis] <i>Record American.</i> Please hold.

28:11.042 --> 28:13.042
I gotta take pictures for your byline.

28:14.375 --> 28:15.458
Since when do they do that?

28:15.458 --> 28:17.000
[photographer] Since they got you two.

28:17.500 --> 28:18.500
What does that mean?

28:18.500 --> 28:21.125
What do you think it means?
It's a circulation stunt.

28:22.333 --> 28:23.333
I'm not doing it.

28:23.333 --> 28:26.917
[photographer] Come on. Why else you think
they got two girls on such a big story?

28:26.917 --> 28:29.958
I don't do stunt reporting.
Tell 'em I'm not doing it.

28:29.958 --> 28:32.542
Tell 'em yourself.
I don't make the rules around here.

28:33.167 --> 28:35.708
- [chattering]

28:35.708 --> 28:36.958
[Phyllis] <i>Record American</i>.

28:39.167 --> 28:40.750
You're gonna let that asshole bother you?

28:42.833 --> 28:46.167
You don't mind being called a fluke?
By that jackass?

28:46.167 --> 28:49.667
Let 'em sell their papers. You still got
the biggest story in the city.

28:57.375 --> 28:58.625
[sighs]

28:59.417 --> 29:02.792
[Loretta] <i>Five women have been strangled
over the past three months.</i>

29:03.500 --> 29:06.792
<i>By number and by nature,
these stranglings are beyond anything</i>

29:06.792 --> 29:09.542
<i>ever seen before
in the criminal history of the city.</i>

29:11.208 --> 29:14.500
The murders are clearly premeditated.
All elderly.

29:14.500 --> 29:17.083
All lived alone. It's a pattern.

29:17.083 --> 29:19.750
[Loretta]
<i>The crimes themselves are insane.</i>

29:19.750 --> 29:22.167
<i>He ransacks the apartments
but doesn't take anything.</i>

29:22.667 --> 29:26.083
<i>He leaves his victims posed
with a bizarre air of ceremony,</i>

29:26.083 --> 29:28.833
<i>each left with a decorative garrote
around her neck.</i>

29:29.542 --> 29:32.583
<i>In every case,
there is no evidence left behind,</i>

29:32.583 --> 29:35.083
<i>no clue as to how he selects his victims.</i>

29:35.750 --> 29:39.625
<i>He seems to come and go as he pleases,
committing his crimes in broad daylight.</i>

29:40.208 --> 29:42.750
[professor]
<i>It's highly organized behavior.</i>

29:42.750 --> 29:47.042
Probably escalated over time,
and now he's lost control.

29:47.542 --> 29:50.542
Barriers are down.
He'll almost certainly repeat.

29:56.250 --> 29:58.000
[chattering]

30:00.167 --> 30:01.167
What's this?

30:01.667 --> 30:02.792
This is all for you two.

30:14.250 --> 30:16.042
[Jean]
"I'm one of the many who can't sleep.

30:16.042 --> 30:19.792
I find myself awake all night and too
frightened to leave during the day."

30:20.667 --> 30:23.958
"Every day is an eternity,
every night a horror.

30:24.667 --> 30:27.000
Nobody knows what a woman alone feels."

30:27.750 --> 30:30.042
"No one knows fear as we know it."

30:31.333 --> 30:35.083
[Loretta] <i>There is but one answer.
The Boston Phantom...</i>

30:40.125 --> 30:43.458
<i>The Boston Strangler must be caught.</i>

30:45.458 --> 30:46.792
Guess he's got a name now.

30:50.833 --> 30:51.917
Shit.

30:51.917 --> 30:53.500
- [chattering]
- [chuckles]

30:54.000 --> 30:55.208
- Mmm.
- Thanks.

30:57.667 --> 31:02.250
So, uh, how'd you become Holland's girl?
He poach you from one of the other papers?

31:03.083 --> 31:05.125
He got me a job
when I graduated high school.

31:06.042 --> 31:08.792
I was working at a lunch counter
down by the courthouse.

31:08.792 --> 31:11.708
He covered a trial
the summer before my senior year.

31:12.417 --> 31:16.417
I got to know him pretty well, and so he
offered to get me a job when I turned 18.

31:17.458 --> 31:20.458
Back then, just living through the day
was an accomplishment.

31:22.042 --> 31:25.125
I wore my school clothes when they first
sent me out on assignments.

31:25.125 --> 31:26.917
I didn't have money for anything else.

31:26.917 --> 31:29.458
Holland took pity on me
and lent me money for a new suit.

31:30.083 --> 31:32.000
I never wanted to let him down after that.

31:32.625 --> 31:33.792
I learned to hold my own,

31:33.792 --> 31:36.792
and he started sending me out
on bigger and bigger stories,

31:36.792 --> 31:38.708
and it just became my life.

31:39.542 --> 31:41.750
I really can't imagine
doing anything else.

31:44.208 --> 31:47.208
It's crazy to think your whole life
can turn on a chance encounter.

31:48.500 --> 31:51.208
My senior year, I, uh--
I lined up with all the other girls

31:51.208 --> 31:52.708
to register for nursing school.

31:53.542 --> 31:56.458
But my English teacher, Mrs. Welker,
she-- she pulled me out of the line

31:56.458 --> 31:59.708
and had me apply for a scholarship
to go to college.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
And that was it.

32:02.958 --> 32:05.042
I'd be changing bedpans
if it wasn't for her.

32:05.042 --> 32:06.708
Thank God for Mrs. Welker.

- <i>Hey, it's Jean.</i>
- Hey.

32:29.083 --> 32:31.958
<i>They found another victim.
It was a young girl this time.</i>

32:31.958 --> 32:34.000
[gasps] I'll come in now.

32:35.750 --> 32:36.750
What was that?

32:37.500 --> 32:40.250
Oh. [sighs]
Another woman turned up. I've gotta go in.

32:41.125 --> 32:44.542
You gotta be kidding me.
It's New Year's Eve for Christ's sakes.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.167
Who's gonna take your mother home?

32:48.167 --> 32:50.333
[stammers] I can take her now, I guess.

32:55.292 --> 32:57.542
Go. I'll deal with it.

34:00.875 --> 34:03.042
[resident]
That guy came to my door earlier today.

34:03.042 --> 34:05.542
He said he was here
to paint the apartment, so I let him in.

34:06.958 --> 34:11.542
All of a sudden, he tells me I'm pretty
and asks me if I thought about modeling.

34:13.042 --> 34:15.667
I got nervous,
told him my husband was home.

34:15.667 --> 34:19.375
I pretended to go back and get him,
and when I came back, he was gone.

34:19.958 --> 34:21.042
What time was this?

34:21.542 --> 34:23.958
Uh, this afternoon. Three o'clock.

34:25.417 --> 34:26.667
Could you describe him for me?

34:27.250 --> 34:31.917
Uh, normal. White guy, dark hair.

34:33.042 --> 34:34.458
He had workman's clothes on.

34:36.542 --> 34:37.708
He just looked regular.

<i>She doesn't fit the pattern.</i>

34:42.250 --> 34:46.000

34:46.708 --> 34:48.167

34:48.167 --> 34:51.667
<i>it usually comes from a trauma
that's been years in the making.</i>

with this type of killer.</i>

With that lunatic still out there?

I don't know what to say. All right?

36:38.875 --> 36:40.250
- Yeah. They called you too?
- Mmm.

36:40.250 --> 36:44.500
Nope. We unlisted our number years ago
after I covered my first mayor's race.

36:46.208 --> 36:47.792
Yeah. Right.

36:48.792 --> 36:50.208

They've been pretty good.

Well, have you got any leads?

37:17.625 --> 37:18.667
Off the record.

Off the record? More than we can handle.

without leaving a shred of evidence.

41:15.167 --> 41:16.917
[doll] <i>Please take me with you.</i>

41:16.917 --> 41:18.042
Jesus.

41:18.875 --> 41:21.875
Mr. Nielson and Patricia
were having an affair.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.625
Everyone in the office knew.

41:25.708 --> 41:26.958
Did he know she was pregnant?

41:28.208 --> 41:29.792
He was helping her sort it out.

41:29.792 --> 41:31.708
Sort it out? How?

41:32.375 --> 41:34.417
[receptionist] He found a convent
in New Hampshire.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.083
They were supposed to arrange
for an adoption.

41:37.917 --> 41:39.917
Do you know if Patricia
wanted to keep the baby?

41:41.833 --> 41:42.833
Maybe.

41:44.292 --> 41:46.375
But Mr. Nielson has a wife and kids.

41:48.833 --> 41:50.000
So that was that.

41:53.750 --> 41:57.083
[parent] Beverly came over every week
no matter what.

41:58.333 --> 42:01.667
She'd bring supper and we'd watch
the stories on the TV together.

42:02.583 --> 42:04.917
Do you know if she had a boyfriend?

42:05.708 --> 42:09.375
I don't think so.
School took up most of her time.

42:10.125 --> 42:13.542
And the choir.
It's where a lot of her friends were from.

42:14.292 --> 42:15.292
At church?

42:15.292 --> 42:18.542
[parent] No.
At BU, where she was studying.

42:19.250 --> 42:22.000
Oh. That's where I went.

42:23.208 --> 42:24.375
[scoffs]

42:24.375 --> 42:26.750
I always thought she'd end up
being someone like you.

42:27.625 --> 42:31.333
You know, with a job she loved,
living on her own terms.

42:32.917 --> 42:34.500
I admired that about her.

42:36.792 --> 42:39.875
She was doin' all the things I wish
I could've done with my own life.

42:42.458 --> 42:43.875
You have kids?

42:43.875 --> 42:45.542
Yeah. Uh, three.

42:46.792 --> 42:50.458
Maggie's nine.
The boys are seven and five.

42:51.958 --> 42:55.417
[parent] Beverly was terrified of the dark
when she was that age.

42:55.417 --> 42:58.583
Only way I could get her to calm down
was by singing to her.

42:59.542 --> 43:00.542
[sobs]

43:01.875 --> 43:05.625
I'm sorry, I just--
I just can't stop thinking about it.

43:06.375 --> 43:11.208
What he did to her.
What that must have been like for her.

43:12.292 --> 43:15.417
[sobbing]

43:15.417 --> 43:18.667
[choir vocalizing]

43:45.125 --> 43:47.500
[friend] Beverly had just broken up
with her boyfriend.

43:49.625 --> 43:52.417
She was taking advantage of her freedom.

43:54.458 --> 43:56.125
Did you meet any of the guys
she was seeing?

43:56.125 --> 43:58.792
Yeah, but they were all harmless.

44:01.042 --> 44:03.625
It's her ex that she was afraid of.

44:05.833 --> 44:08.667
Uh-- Sorry, who is that?

44:11.917 --> 44:13.125
Daniel Marsh.

44:14.333 --> 44:15.583
Why was she afraid of him?

44:16.292 --> 44:17.958
He was harassing her.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.833
He had just gotten kicked out of Harvard,
was acting really erratic.

44:24.292 --> 44:29.292
He'd call in the middle of the night,
show up unannounced. Things like that.

44:31.333 --> 44:32.417
And when was this?

44:33.708 --> 44:35.542
Right up until around when it happened.

45:06.667 --> 45:08.667
[doorbell buzzes]

45:19.875 --> 45:20.875
Daniel Marsh?

45:21.500 --> 45:22.333
Yes?

45:22.333 --> 45:24.750
Loretta McLaughlin
with the <i>Record American</i>.

45:25.250 --> 45:26.542

45:38.458 --> 45:39.458
[door closes]

45:40.458 --> 45:42.208
Come in. Come in.

45:57.750 --> 45:58.750
It's just back here.

45:58.750 --> 46:00.875
[machine rattling]

46:00.875 --> 46:02.375
We can talk just back here.

46:07.167 --> 46:11.583
Uh, I've just remembered that I've got,
uh, another appointment.

46:11.583 --> 46:15.042
I'm gonna have to--
I'm gonna have to come back another time.

46:18.125 --> 46:19.292

[doll] <i>Please take me with you.</i>

46:40.250 --> 46:41.667
You okay?

46:41.667 --> 46:42.750
Yeah.

46:43.333 --> 46:44.417
Don't stay here all night.

46:45.708 --> 46:46.708
I'm serious.

46:47.667 --> 46:48.667
I won't.

46:50.417 --> 46:52.167
[doll] <i>Please take me with you.</i>

46:58.542 --> 47:00.458
Wait, what did you say his name was?

47:02.958 --> 47:04.958
No, you called me.

47:07.167 --> 47:09.875
- Runnin' a hotline for the mentally unfit.
- [Loretta chuckles]

47:09.875 --> 47:11.333
That's everything.

47:11.333 --> 47:15.083
All right. Give me some time. I gotta
wade through this pile of shit first.

47:15.833 --> 47:17.083
Don't wait on these.

47:18.292 --> 47:19.292
They're good leads.

47:23.875 --> 47:24.875
[door lock clicks]

47:24.875 --> 47:26.958
[chattering on TV]

47:32.417 --> 47:33.417
[door lock clicks]

47:59.125 --> 48:00.958
- [detective] Boston Police Department!
- [gasps]

48:01.458 --> 48:02.458
Gordon Nielson?

48:02.458 --> 48:04.208
- [Nielson] Yes.
- [detective] Hands on the wall.

48:06.750 --> 48:08.375
[examiner] Your name is Gordon Nielson?

48:08.375 --> 48:09.458
[Nielson] Yes.

48:11.208 --> 48:12.917
[examiner] You've been divorced once?

48:13.792 --> 48:15.125
[Nielson] Yes.

48:15.125 --> 48:17.667
[examiner] Patricia Bissette worked
as your secretary?

48:17.667 --> 48:18.750
[Nielson] Yes.

48:21.208 --> 48:23.792
[examiner] Did you have a relationship
with her outside of work?

48:24.333 --> 48:25.333
Yes.

48:26.833 --> 48:29.083
[examiner] Did you see Patricia
the night she was murdered?

48:30.042 --> 48:31.042
No.

48:45.042 --> 48:46.625
Can I have an update, Detective?

48:48.333 --> 48:51.500
We caught Nielson removing evidence
from Patricia's apartment.

48:52.542 --> 48:53.917
He failed two polygraph tests,

48:53.917 --> 48:56.083
but the DA still doesn't think
he has a case,

48:56.083 --> 48:57.958
and there's nothing tying him
to the other murders.

48:57.958 --> 48:59.417
So, what about Daniel Marsh?

48:59.417 --> 49:00.917
Who? The Harvard psycho?

49:01.542 --> 49:04.292
He's batshit crazy, I'll give you that,
but we got nothin' on him.

49:04.292 --> 49:06.542
Well, he was harassing Beverly
the week before she was killed.

49:06.542 --> 49:08.625
Uh, you can't charge a guy
for getting high

49:08.625 --> 49:10.667
and calling his ex-girlfriend
in the middle of the night.

49:10.667 --> 49:11.625
What, so that's it?

49:11.625 --> 49:15.125
I-I don't think you understand
what I'm dealin' with here.

49:16.250 --> 49:18.250
I'm gettin' a hundred tips a day,

49:18.250 --> 49:20.458
I got thousands of sex offenders
to screen,

49:20.458 --> 49:24.542
and now the commissioner just ordered
a raid on every gay bar in the city.

49:26.333 --> 49:29.417
I'm doing all I can,
but I'm not playing with a full deck.

49:30.042 --> 49:31.333
I'll see ya later.

49:31.333 --> 49:32.333
[car door opens]

49:32.333 --> 49:34.833
How many gay bars in Boston
are there anyway?

49:34.833 --> 49:35.958
There can't be that many.

49:35.958 --> 49:37.125
Way to miss the point, Jack.

49:37.125 --> 49:40.250
The point is Commissioner McNamara's
not up to the job.

49:40.250 --> 49:41.792
What does that mean, exactly?

49:41.792 --> 49:43.083
His head's shoved up his ass.

49:43.083 --> 49:45.125
They won't coordinate
with other police departments,

49:45.125 --> 49:46.250
connections are being missed,

49:46.250 --> 49:48.125
and good leads
are falling through the cracks.

49:48.125 --> 49:49.542
Isn't some of that to be expected?

49:49.542 --> 49:51.125
[Loretta] We are way beyond that.

49:51.125 --> 49:52.917
Oh, I'm sorry, Jack, am I keeping you up?

49:52.917 --> 49:55.000
Will you cut the shit already?
What's the story?

49:55.000 --> 49:57.333
- The city can't protect its women.
- Come on.

49:57.333 --> 49:59.750
What? You don't think it's true,
or you don't think it's a story?

49:59.750 --> 50:00.917
[Jack] What is it with you?

50:00.917 --> 50:04.125
You can't go after someone's livelihood
because you're impatient.

50:04.125 --> 50:06.458
Ten women are dead,
and these assholes don't have a clue!

50:06.458 --> 50:09.542
You don't have a story. You have a grudge.

50:09.542 --> 50:12.167
How many women have to die
before it's a story?

50:12.167 --> 50:13.250
That's enough.

50:13.833 --> 50:15.917
These are good men busting their asses.

50:15.917 --> 50:18.292
I'm not waging a war
on the police department.

50:21.750 --> 50:24.500
[footsteps departing]

50:24.500 --> 50:27.583
[chattering on TV]

50:37.792 --> 50:38.875
Where you been?

50:40.042 --> 50:41.292
I had to work late.

50:43.792 --> 50:45.708
Oh, my God. Get a plate.
You're gonna make a mess.

50:45.708 --> 50:47.000
I'm not gonna make a mess.

50:56.792 --> 50:59.458
Sit down. I gotta talk to you anyway.

50:59.458 --> 51:01.625
Look, I've had a long day. Can't it wait?

51:02.208 --> 51:04.917
Loretta, sit down.

51:15.208 --> 51:17.042
I took a new position at work.

51:17.792 --> 51:21.875
It's better pay, but I have to be
in the Connecticut office part-time.

51:21.875 --> 51:23.042
Part-time?

51:24.583 --> 51:25.750
A few days a week.

51:27.333 --> 51:28.750
How long's this been in the works?

51:29.375 --> 51:30.375
Couple weeks.

51:30.375 --> 51:32.458
And when were you gonna tell me about it?

51:32.458 --> 51:36.708
A lot of long days lately.
Hasn't exactly been a good time.

51:36.708 --> 51:39.167
How are we supposed to manage
with you gone half the week?

51:39.833 --> 51:41.333
You're gonna have to do your share.

51:41.333 --> 51:44.917
What more could I possibly do
short of quit my job?

51:44.917 --> 51:47.250
Is this your way of telling me
to stay home? Is that what this is?

51:47.250 --> 51:49.125
Come on.
Have I ever asked you to stay home?

51:49.125 --> 51:51.125
No, you just do
something like this instead.

51:51.125 --> 51:54.000
What, I'm free to do what I want as long
as it's on your terms, isn't that right?

51:54.000 --> 51:55.375
You are unbelievable, you know that?

51:55.375 --> 51:57.708
My-- My sister's right about you.
You're just--

51:57.708 --> 51:58.792
What?

51:59.875 --> 52:02.542
Say it. Say it.

52:03.667 --> 52:06.625
Most people would be happy
their husband got a promotion.

52:30.958 --> 52:34.458
My name's Detective Linski, I'm with
the New York City Police Department.

52:34.458 --> 52:38.000
I'm calling about a murder we had
down here couple of weeks ago.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.333
Looks like it could be linked
to the stranglings.

52:41.625 --> 52:42.833
Older lady.

52:42.833 --> 52:45.292
Yeah, she turned up dead in a hotel room,

52:45.292 --> 52:48.042
strangled with stockings
tied around her neck.

52:48.042 --> 52:50.458
People from the hotel
saw the guy she was with.

52:50.458 --> 52:54.208
Couple of nights later he shows up
at the hotel bar, so I pick him up...

52:54.208 --> 52:56.958
[scoffs] ...find her cigarette case
still in his pocket.

52:57.792 --> 53:00.208
<i>Only took me 45 minutes
to get a confession.</i>

53:01.583 --> 53:03.500
<i>His name is Paul Dempsey.</i>

53:03.500 --> 53:06.375
<i>Lives up in Maine,
but I can place him in Boston</i>

53:06.375 --> 53:08.458
<i>at the time of the first five murders.</i>

53:09.292 --> 53:11.625
Uh, I'm assuming
you went to Boston Homicide with this?

53:11.625 --> 53:15.042
First call I made.
Couldn't get anyone to call me back.

53:15.042 --> 53:18.250
<i>Couple of weeks go by,
so I make the trip up there myself.</i>

53:18.250 --> 53:20.333
<i>Figure I'll just tell 'em in person.</i>

53:21.125 --> 53:24.208
Couldn't get anyone to meet with me.
Can you believe that?

53:25.833 --> 53:28.417
Detective drove four hours
for a homicide I'm working,

53:29.167 --> 53:31.167
I'd walk out of my kid's christening
for that.

53:31.917 --> 53:33.667
I don't know what the hell
they're doin' up there.

53:33.667 --> 53:36.833
Turns out Paul Dempsey was a suspect
in a murder in Maine

53:36.833 --> 53:39.083
four years
before the first Strangler murder.

53:39.083 --> 53:41.125
The victim was an elderly woman
found strangled

53:41.125 --> 53:42.708
with her stockings tied around her neck.

53:42.708 --> 53:44.375
It could be the original Strangler murder,

53:44.375 --> 53:46.708
but no one can get Boston Homicide
to look into it.

53:46.708 --> 53:48.500
And this cop in New York
will go on the record?

53:48.500 --> 53:49.958
Already did.

53:49.958 --> 53:51.833
We're not running a hit job
on the police department.

53:51.833 --> 53:54.833
They're blowing the investigation.
How long can we keep ignoring it?

53:54.833 --> 53:58.042
I don't know how many times we have
to tell you, but we're not doing it.

53:58.708 --> 54:00.125
I don't know, Eddie.

54:02.292 --> 54:04.708
I mean, she's right.
We can't keep looking the other way.

54:05.292 --> 54:08.083
You really wanna use this paper
to tear down the police department?

54:08.083 --> 54:10.208
If anyone else was blowing it this badly,

54:10.208 --> 54:12.708
we'd have put it on the front page
a long time ago.

54:13.875 --> 54:14.875
All right.

54:15.958 --> 54:18.500
You want to run with this?
I'm not gonna stand in your way.

54:19.042 --> 54:21.625
But it's your neck on the block.
You understand?

54:22.333 --> 54:23.375
All right.

54:26.167 --> 54:28.042
[thunder rumbling]

54:30.875 --> 54:32.125

54:41.542 --> 54:45.125
<i>a missing link,

54:46.000 --> 54:48.917
Unless a centralized effort is set up
to catch the Strangler,

54:48.917 --> 54:52.375
he will remain today
as he did one year ago,

54:52.375 --> 54:56.625

Oh.

58:23.917 --> 58:25.125
Someone came to the house?

58:25.125 --> 58:29.042
They put it in the mail slot.
It was just me and the kids home.

58:29.042 --> 58:32.042
You think it was a deranged cop
or some deranged asshole?

58:32.042 --> 58:34.583
Well, I'm not exactly pleased
about it either way.

58:38.292 --> 58:39.292
Where are you going?

58:45.250 --> 58:47.625
Now, I didn't say anything when you put
our pictures in the paper,

58:47.625 --> 58:50.167
but you and I both know what that was.
That was a stunt.

58:50.167 --> 58:52.000
- And I know you wanna sell your papers...
- Calm down.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.125
...but at what cost?

58:53.125 --> 58:55.833
There's more than one lunatic out there,
and you're gonna get us both killed!

58:55.833 --> 58:57.208
- You take it out!
- I'll handle it.

59:03.042 --> 59:05.292
They're not puttin' our picture
in the paper anymore.

59:07.792 --> 59:08.792
I need a drink.

59:11.958 --> 59:13.833
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do anymore.

59:13.833 --> 59:15.292
- [Jean] About what?
- About everything.

59:15.875 --> 59:18.167
You know, it's like I get to do half
of everything I really want

59:18.167 --> 59:20.417
and everyone around me
still feels shortchanged.

59:21.958 --> 59:23.292
James has had enough.

59:23.292 --> 59:25.708
And my-- my poor kids are spooked.

59:27.125 --> 59:29.708
You know, most of my paycheck
goes to the babysitter now?

59:30.208 --> 59:31.292
Who cares?

59:31.292 --> 59:34.250
You're gonna make yourself crazy
worrying about everyone else all the time.

59:34.250 --> 59:35.333
[chuckles]

59:35.333 --> 59:38.500
You can't be apologetic, not about
the things that are important to you.

59:39.458 --> 59:41.875
How come you're so calm about everything?

59:41.875 --> 59:44.375
Now, you've got kids.
It must be crazy for you too.

59:45.125 --> 59:47.500
How do you keep
everything so under control?

59:47.500 --> 59:49.542
My life's a three-ring circus.

59:49.542 --> 59:52.500
The wheels have been about to fall off
since our youngest was born.

59:53.833 --> 59:56.250
So, what do you want to do
about this story?

59:56.250 --> 59:58.250
You sure you want to keep going with this?

[detective]
Boston Police are keeping us in the dark.

1:00:05.167 --> 1:00:07.250
They won't talk to any
of the other departments.

1:00:07.250 --> 1:00:09.167
And they sure as hell don't want our help.

1:00:09.167 --> 1:00:10.708
Would you go on the record with that?

1:00:12.958 --> 1:00:15.625
Yeah. Go ahead, print my name.

1:00:16.792 --> 1:00:17.875
Print this too.

1:00:19.375 --> 1:00:21.375
Couple weeks ago,
we get a call about this guy,

1:00:21.375 --> 1:00:23.500
was harassing these girls
in their apartment.

1:00:24.083 --> 1:00:26.667
Then Boston won't share
any information with us.

1:00:28.167 --> 1:00:29.500
So we just let him go.

1:00:30.583 --> 1:00:33.167
I come to find out
he's one of their prime suspects.

1:00:34.167 --> 1:00:36.792
We had him, and we just let him walk away.

1:00:37.667 --> 1:00:38.667
What was his name?

1:00:40.583 --> 1:00:41.750
Off the record...

1:00:43.125 --> 1:00:44.417
Albert DeSalvo.

1:00:45.833 --> 1:00:47.333
He's famous over in Cambridge.

1:00:49.125 --> 1:00:51.542
- Famous for what?
- [sighs]

1:00:51.542 --> 1:00:54.875

- Thank you.

All right, whose file you need?

1:01:11.583 --> 1:01:13.042
[Loretta] Uh, DeSalvo.

1:01:13.042 --> 1:01:14.875
- Which one?
- Sorry?

1:01:15.375 --> 1:01:17.500
All the DeSalvo brothers
graduated from jail.

1:01:17.500 --> 1:01:19.750
- Which one ya need?
- Albert.

1:01:19.750 --> 1:01:21.792
- [desk officer] Figures.
- What, you know him?

1:01:21.792 --> 1:01:25.458
Every cop in Cambridge knows him.
Al's a world-class creep.

1:01:26.542 --> 1:01:29.542
Just got nabbed on rape charges
over in Malden.

1:01:29.542 --> 1:01:31.208
- He's in custody?
- Yeah.

1:01:31.208 --> 1:01:34.333
They got him up in Bridgewater right now.
Have fun.

1:01:50.375 --> 1:01:54.250
[sergeant] DeSalvo had two cons,
the Green Man and the Measuring Man.

1:01:54.917 --> 1:01:57.417
They called him the Green Man
'cause he put on green workman's clothes

1:01:57.417 --> 1:01:59.417
and posed as the maintenance guy,

1:01:59.417 --> 1:02:02.000
say he needed to check something
inside their apartments.

1:02:03.292 --> 1:02:05.625
[Loretta]
And, uh, what about the Measuring Man?

1:02:05.625 --> 1:02:08.667
[sergeant] I don't know where he came up
with this one,

1:02:08.667 --> 1:02:11.000
but he'd pretend to be a modeling scout.

1:02:11.625 --> 1:02:15.083
And he'd convince these girls to let him
in so he could take their measurements.

1:02:16.375 --> 1:02:18.500
You wouldn't believe
how many people let him do it.

1:02:19.708 --> 1:02:24.250
He told me I had a nice figure.
He said his agency would hire me.

1:02:24.250 --> 1:02:27.333
He just needed to take some measurements.

1:02:28.708 --> 1:02:30.375
But he didn't have a measuring tape.

1:02:32.542 --> 1:02:34.000
He just used his hands.

1:02:37.292 --> 1:02:38.875
<i>I got this horrible feeling.</i>

1:02:41.083 --> 1:02:42.333
<i>My whole body just froze.</i>

1:02:45.125 --> 1:02:47.125
[church bells tolling]

1:02:54.167 --> 1:02:56.250
[chattering]

1:03:11.625 --> 1:03:13.875
- You remember Sophie's neighbor?
- [Jean] Mm-hmm.

1:03:13.875 --> 1:03:17.375
Uh, she said a man came to her apartment
the day Sophie was killed.

1:03:17.375 --> 1:03:19.708
Now, first he said he was there
to paint the apartment,

1:03:19.708 --> 1:03:22.042
and then he asked her
if she ever thought about modeling.

1:03:23.083 --> 1:03:26.583
The Green Man slipped
into the Measuring Man. It's DeSalvo.

1:03:27.708 --> 1:03:28.958
[chattering]

1:03:28.958 --> 1:03:30.042
[host] Right this way.

1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:35.833
I can't be caught dead
talking to you right now.

1:03:35.833 --> 1:03:38.917
- That bad, huh?
- No, I'm serious.

1:03:39.750 --> 1:03:43.000
If you gotta call me at the station,
you say you're my sister Sally, all right?

1:03:46.208 --> 1:03:47.667
What do you have for me?

1:03:56.333 --> 1:03:59.042
- It's not him.
- Well, it has to be him. Look--

1:03:59.042 --> 1:04:02.000
I mean, Sophie's neighbor said
he came to paint the apartment,

1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.667
but then he slipped up
and started talking to her about modeling.

1:04:04.667 --> 1:04:07.792
I mean, those are the two cons
DeSalvo is famous for.

1:04:07.792 --> 1:04:11.875
I worked DeSalvo for weeks.
I loved him for it. It's not him.

1:04:12.708 --> 1:04:13.792
What makes you so sure?

1:04:13.792 --> 1:04:16.042
He was in prison
for the first six murders,

1:04:16.042 --> 1:04:18.125
didn't get out
until after Sophie was killed.

1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.500
Whoever was in that lady's apartment
wasn't DeSalvo.

1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.000
[sighs]

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:28.000
What you're feeling right now,
that's every day for me.

1:04:29.875 --> 1:04:32.500
You know how many people
I've gone down the rabbit hole with?

1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:34.750
It's a dead-end every time with this case.

1:04:34.750 --> 1:04:36.458
You get your teeth into something

1:04:36.458 --> 1:04:39.833
and then your bottom falls out at three
in the morning, and you got nothin'.

1:04:42.083 --> 1:04:43.917
And while I'm making myself crazy...

1:04:47.917 --> 1:04:49.417
he's out there somewhere...

1:04:52.083 --> 1:04:53.250
laughing at us.

1:05:30.125 --> 1:05:32.125
[chattering]

1:05:39.375 --> 1:05:41.042
You still stuck on DeSalvo?

1:05:41.625 --> 1:05:43.292
Everything lines up with him.

1:05:43.292 --> 1:05:45.625
His history,
the progression of the crimes, everything.

1:05:45.625 --> 1:05:48.708
[Jean] Except for the part where he was
in prison for the first six murders.

1:05:52.708 --> 1:05:54.583
Have you seen the actual release records?

1:06:18.542 --> 1:06:19.708

1:06:26.542 --> 1:06:27.625

1:06:42.625 --> 1:06:43.625
Look at this.

1:06:49.292 --> 1:06:50.542
Oh, my God.

1:06:50.542 --> 1:06:53.125
DeSalvo petitioned the judge
for early release.

1:06:53.125 --> 1:06:55.208
He said he had to get back
to his wife and kids.

1:06:55.958 --> 1:06:57.792
The judge let him out for good behavior.

1:06:57.792 --> 1:06:59.667
So, he was out in time?

1:06:59.667 --> 1:07:01.417
Two months before the first murder.

<i>The suspect is presently confined

A hotshot defense lawyer.
One of those press hounds.

1:07:31.542 --> 1:07:34.083
How the hell did DeSalvo
get a hotshot lawyer?

1:07:34.083 --> 1:07:37.167
I don't know.

1:07:44.958 --> 1:07:46.292
What's on the docket tonight?

1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.042
[Loretta] I'm writing a story
about how Albert DeSalvo

1:07:49.042 --> 1:07:50.792
got a high-priced defense lawyer.

1:07:52.167 --> 1:07:55.083
Would someone familiar
with the investigation care to comment?

1:07:56.500 --> 1:07:57.542
No.

1:07:57.542 --> 1:07:59.500
[Loretta] So, what happened
when you went to question him?

1:07:59.500 --> 1:08:00.792
[birds squawking]

[Jim] <i>Bailey got to him first.
Wouldn't let us interview him.</i>

1:08:06.042 --> 1:08:09.375
<i>So, I brought Sophie Clark's neighbor in
to ID DeSalvo.</i>

1:08:37.458 --> 1:08:38.708
She didn't recognize him?

1:08:38.708 --> 1:08:41.667
Not only did she not recognize him,
she ID'd someone else.

1:08:41.667 --> 1:08:42.792
Who?

1:08:42.792 --> 1:08:44.500
George Nassar.

1:08:50.375 --> 1:08:52.750
<i>Murdered a gas station attendant

1:08:53.750 --> 1:08:57.833
[scoffs] Real piece of work.
Schizophrenic with a genius IQ.

1:08:57.833 --> 1:08:59.250
And?

1:08:59.875 --> 1:09:03.833
It's not him.
Been in custody for over a year.

1:09:07.333 --> 1:09:10.333
[reporters clamoring]

1:09:11.417 --> 1:09:13.500
[Bailey] People can breathe
a sigh of relief tonight.

1:09:13.500 --> 1:09:15.292
The career of the Boston Strangler
is over.

1:09:15.292 --> 1:09:18.375
- [reporter 1] Is it true Mr. Bailey?
- [reporter 2] He's telling the truth?

1:09:18.375 --> 1:09:21.792
[Bailey] I obtained five details
only the killer could know.

1:09:21.792 --> 1:09:23.500
When I quizzed DeSalvo,
he went five for five.

1:09:23.500 --> 1:09:24.958
[reporter 3] Mr. Bailey!

1:09:24.958 --> 1:09:29.042
When you've done as many interrogations as
I have, you develop an ear for bullshit.

1:09:29.042 --> 1:09:30.500
[reporters laughing]

1:09:30.500 --> 1:09:32.792
And was law enforcement
a part of this process?

1:09:34.917 --> 1:09:36.625
That's all I'm gonna say right now.

1:09:37.542 --> 1:09:40.750
We're still negotiating his confession.
If you'll excuse me.

1:09:40.750 --> 1:09:43.250
- [shutter clicks]
- [reporters clamoring]

1:09:43.250 --> 1:09:44.667
[reporter 4] Will he confess?

1:09:52.792 --> 1:09:54.292
[Bottomly] This is John Bottomly.

1:09:55.833 --> 1:09:58.833
The date is February 14th, 1964.

1:10:00.667 --> 1:10:03.667
Albert, please state your full name.

1:10:08.417 --> 1:10:10.083

1:10:12.500 --> 1:10:14.958
[Bottomly] Mr. DeSalvo, we are here today

1:10:14.958 --> 1:10:19.458
because you intend to confess
to all 13 Boston Strangler murders.

1:10:19.458 --> 1:10:20.542
Is that correct?

1:25:40.667 --> 1:25:42.167
I just got back from Michigan.

1:25:42.167 --> 1:25:43.458
I heard.

1:25:45.958 --> 1:25:46.958
You don't care to know?

1:25:46.958 --> 1:25:48.417
No, I don't.

1:25:51.708 --> 1:25:53.292
I need DeSalvo's confession.

1:25:54.208 --> 1:25:55.750
You gotta go see Bottomly for that.

1:25:55.750 --> 1:25:57.250
I know you made a copy.

1:25:57.250 --> 1:25:59.208
- [Jim] How do you know that?
- Oh, come on.

1:26:00.417 --> 1:26:02.917
I bet you stayed up every night
listening to those tapes.

1:26:05.125 --> 1:26:07.917
If we were right about DeSalvo,
what are you so afraid of?

1:26:07.917 --> 1:26:11.417
Go home. Spend some time with your kids.

1:26:12.500 --> 1:26:14.667
How do you just stop caring
after all this?

1:26:15.792 --> 1:26:17.833
When you realize
you could give up your whole life for it,

1:26:17.833 --> 1:26:19.083
and no one would give a shit.

1:26:23.250 --> 1:26:24.333
Go home.

1:26:25.125 --> 1:26:27.125

[Phyllis] <i>Record American.</i>

1:27:02.583 --> 1:27:04.500
[Bottomly on headphones]
<i>This is John Bottomly.</i>

1:27:04.500 --> 1:27:08.083
<i>The date is February 14th, 1964.</i>

1:27:08.083 --> 1:27:10.333

[DeSalvo] <i>Albert Henry DeSalvo.</i>

1:27:13.333 --> 1:27:17.292
[Bottomly] <i>Mr. DeSalvo,
tell me about your first victim.</i>

1:27:17.292 --> 1:27:19.542
<i>How did you pick Anna Slesers?</i>

1:27:19.542 --> 1:27:21.083
[DeSalvo] <i>I didn't pick her in advance.</i>

1:27:21.083 --> 1:27:23.458
<i>There was a parking spot
in front of the house.</i>

1:27:24.375 --> 1:27:26.667
<i>It makes you think about
what goes into this kind of selection.</i>

1:27:26.667 --> 1:27:30.333
Like, why is this girl home
and that one's not?

1:27:31.542 --> 1:27:34.208
What is it? Is it fate?

1:27:42.500 --> 1:27:46.000
[Bottomly] <i>Okay, Albert.
I'd like to ask you about her clothing.</i>

1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:48.917
<i>Can you tell me what color robe
she was wearing?</i>

1:27:57.208 --> 1:27:58.208
Aren't you on a new story?

1:27:59.083 --> 1:28:01.708
Get over yourself. Let me listen.

1:28:08.125 --> 1:28:10.208
[Bottomly] <i>Albert,
what color robe was she wearing?</i>

1:28:10.833 --> 1:28:15.417
[DeSalvo]
<i>Yellow. Or maybe it was, uh, red.</i>

1:28:15.417 --> 1:28:16.500
[Bottomly] <i>You-- You sure?</i>

1:28:16.500 --> 1:28:19.250
[DeSalvo] <i>No. It was blue.</i>

1:28:19.250 --> 1:28:21.833
[Bottomly] <i>That's right. Let's move on.</i>

1:28:23.208 --> 1:28:27.042
So, when you entered the apartment,
can you tell me what you saw?

1:28:27.875 --> 1:28:30.375
[DeSalvo]
Well, the kitchen was on the left.

1:28:30.375 --> 1:28:32.625
[Bottomly] Wait-- It was on the left?

1:28:33.708 --> 1:28:34.875
[DeSalvo] Um, maybe...

1:28:35.875 --> 1:28:37.083
[Bottomly] Well, here. Um...

1:28:37.083 --> 1:28:39.333
[paper rustles on recording]

1:28:39.333 --> 1:28:41.292
[DeSalvo] <i>That's right.
The kitchen was on the right,</i>

1:28:41.292 --> 1:28:43.625
<i>and the bedroom was down that hall.</i>

1:28:44.333 --> 1:28:45.333
[Bottomly] <i>That hall?</i>

1:28:45.333 --> 1:28:47.083
[DeSalvo] <i>That-- Yeah. Down that hall.</i>

1:28:51.625 --> 1:28:53.625
Bottomly just showed him
the crime scene photo.

1:28:57.958 --> 1:28:59.542
[DeSalvo] <i>Um, maybe...</i>

1:28:59.542 --> 1:29:00.708
[Bottomly] <i>Well, here. Um...</i>

1:29:00.708 --> 1:29:02.458

<i>and the bedroom was down that hall.</i>

1:29:07.542 --> 1:29:08.542
[Bottomly] <i>That hall?</i>

1:29:08.542 --> 1:29:10.292
[DeSalvo] <i>That-- Yeah. Down that hall.</i>

1:29:11.792 --> 1:29:13.917
Any lawyer worth a dime
would pick this apart.

1:29:25.917 --> 1:29:28.208
[Loretta] Excuse me, I'm--
I'm looking for Richard DeSalvo.

1:29:28.208 --> 1:29:29.500
[foreman] He's back there.

1:29:31.500 --> 1:29:35.167
Look,
Al's not talkin' to reporters anymore.

1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:38.167
Al's had it tough.

1:29:39.292 --> 1:29:42.958
Whatever my brother did,
he never meant to harm nobody.

1:29:44.625 --> 1:29:47.917
He loves his family,
always been good to them.

1:29:48.542 --> 1:29:50.375
Look, I know there's more to his story.

1:29:51.917 --> 1:29:54.167
But there's nothing I can do
if he won't talk to me.

1:29:57.458 --> 1:30:00.875
I'll float it by him,
but I'm not making any promises.

[DeSalvo] <i>Yeah, this is Albert DeSalvo.</i>

1:30:10.458 --> 1:30:11.833
<i>Is, uh, Loretta there?</i>

1:30:13.750 --> 1:30:14.833
One minute, please.

1:30:21.208 --> 1:30:23.458
Albert DeSalvo's on line two. [sighs]

1:30:30.917 --> 1:30:33.000
Uh, this is Loretta.

1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:34.500
<i>Hi, Loretta. It's Albert.</i>

1:30:34.500 --> 1:30:37.000
You know, my brother said
you come to see him.

1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:39.333
I told him that I knew you
from the papers.

1:30:39.333 --> 1:30:42.083
[chuckles] It's funny, I always said
you girls knew more than the police.

1:30:43.458 --> 1:30:46.792
Uh, why don't I come down there
so we can talk in person?

1:30:47.417 --> 1:30:50.292
The thing is, I'm not giving my story away
for free anymore.

1:30:51.333 --> 1:30:53.625
I got really screwed over
on that book deal.

1:30:53.625 --> 1:30:55.708
[Loretta]
<i>I listened to your confession, Albert,</i>

1:30:55.708 --> 1:30:58.625
and, uh, I think
there's more to your story.

1:30:58.625 --> 1:31:01.375
Well, like I said,
I'm not talking to reporters anymore.

1:31:03.750 --> 1:31:05.250
Don't you want people to know the truth?

1:31:05.250 --> 1:31:06.583
<i>I don't give a damn about that.</i>

1:31:06.583 --> 1:31:07.917
I've got a family to support.

1:31:07.917 --> 1:31:09.917
I don't think you understand
how screwed over I got.

1:31:10.583 --> 1:31:12.667
Well, what are you holding out for,
Albert?

1:31:12.667 --> 1:31:15.583
If everybody already screwed you over,
then what've you got left to lose?

1:31:16.458 --> 1:31:18.208
<i>Why would you let them get away with it?</i>

1:31:28.500 --> 1:31:30.125
Come here tomorrow at visiting hours.

<i>Hey, it's Jack.
A report just came over the wire.</i>

<i>DeSalvo was killed in his cell.</i> [sighs]

1:32:37.208 --> 1:32:38.208
You get anything?

1:32:38.208 --> 1:32:39.708
[Stanley] No official statement yet.

1:32:39.708 --> 1:32:42.417
My guys at the <i>Herald</i> said
he got killed over drugs, but--

1:32:42.417 --> 1:32:43.792
No, that doesn't make any sense.

1:32:43.792 --> 1:32:46.125
[reporters clamoring]

1:32:51.042 --> 1:32:53.458
He was in there with them.
He knew what they were up to.

1:33:02.333 --> 1:33:03.333
[phone rings]

1:33:03.333 --> 1:33:04.417
Hello.

1:33:04.417 --> 1:33:06.333
I need you to take down an address.

1:33:06.958 --> 1:33:08.958
If I don't call back in an hour,
give it to the police.

1:33:09.583 --> 1:33:10.667
What the hell are you doing?

1:33:10.667 --> 1:33:14.417
426 Columbia Road. Got it?

1:33:14.417 --> 1:33:15.750
Got it.

1:33:15.750 --> 1:33:16.917
Loretta--

1:33:19.583 --> 1:33:21.292

I'm lookin' for Harrison.

1:33:34.542 --> 1:33:36.000
He's down at the end of the hall.

1:34:08.417 --> 1:34:09.417
[Loretta] Harrison?

1:34:09.417 --> 1:34:10.500
Yeah.

1:34:11.125 --> 1:34:13.125
I-I'm a reporter with the <i>Record American</i>.

1:34:13.875 --> 1:34:16.125
I want to ask you some questions
about Bridgewater.

1:34:22.625 --> 1:34:26.625
Me and DeSalvo were in the same ward.
I saw him every day.

1:34:28.792 --> 1:34:32.292
And what about... him?

1:34:36.458 --> 1:34:39.458
Yeah. He was in my ward too.

1:34:41.292 --> 1:34:42.792
They were always together.

1:34:43.375 --> 1:34:44.625
Marsh and DeSalvo?

1:34:45.250 --> 1:34:46.542
And Nassar.

1:34:47.792 --> 1:34:49.292
George Nassar?

1:34:57.042 --> 1:35:00.708
Yeah, the three of them were always
working on DeSalvo's confession.

1:35:02.333 --> 1:35:04.542
W-What do you mean working on?

1:35:05.542 --> 1:35:09.208
They coached him.
They were at it every day for weeks.

1:35:10.792 --> 1:35:12.708
<i>They had a stack of newspaper clippings,</i>

1:35:12.708 --> 1:35:16.417
<i>and they would quiz DeSalvo
about the details.</i>

1:35:18.250 --> 1:35:20.083
<i>I remember Marsh sayin',</i>

1:35:20.083 --> 1:35:23.417
<i>"You gotta get it so deep in your brain
that you believe it yourself."</i>

1:35:24.625 --> 1:35:28.125
But what did they care
if DeSalvo confessed?

1:35:31.208 --> 1:35:35.042
Reward money.
That's why Nassar got his lawyer involved.

1:35:35.625 --> 1:35:36.875
I'm not shittin' you.

1:35:37.708 --> 1:35:39.625
He's willing to confess
to the whole thing.

1:35:41.333 --> 1:35:43.417
[Harrison]
<i>His lawyer organized the whole thing.</i>

1:35:44.083 --> 1:35:45.750
You mean F. Lee Bailey?

1:35:46.792 --> 1:35:47.792
That's right.

1:35:48.917 --> 1:35:53.417
He told Albert that he could get him
a book deal, make him rich and famous.

1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:59.500
Albert thought he was gonna make
a million bucks off it

1:36:00.333 --> 1:36:01.750
and support his family.

1:36:56.083 --> 1:36:57.167
You got a smoke?

1:37:17.542 --> 1:37:19.125
So, you wanna know about Albert.

1:37:20.333 --> 1:37:21.625
How did you know each other?

1:37:22.125 --> 1:37:23.750
We were cellmates.

1:37:23.750 --> 1:37:25.167
[Loretta] Before he confessed?

1:37:26.458 --> 1:37:27.875
Yeah, for a couple months.

1:37:27.875 --> 1:37:30.375
It's an awfully strange coincidence,
don't you think?

1:37:31.750 --> 1:37:34.250
You're the one
who gets picked out of the lineup,

1:37:34.250 --> 1:37:38.000
and you just happen to be
DeSalvo's cellmate?

1:37:39.125 --> 1:37:40.958
Maybe I just got one of those faces.

1:37:44.250 --> 1:37:46.750
Were you in Sophie Clark's building
the day she was killed?

1:37:47.875 --> 1:37:48.875
No.

1:37:50.625 --> 1:37:51.792
I don't kill women.

1:37:53.292 --> 1:37:57.792
And I got no reason to lie about that now.
I'm doin' a life sentence.

1:38:00.250 --> 1:38:02.000
[Loretta] Then why did you coach DeSalvo?

1:38:02.583 --> 1:38:04.250
I wouldn't exactly call it that.

1:38:06.375 --> 1:38:08.958
I was just helpin' him remember.

1:38:10.750 --> 1:38:12.917
Thirteen murders,
that's a lot to keep straight.

1:38:12.917 --> 1:38:14.208
Why were you helping him?

1:38:15.167 --> 1:38:18.833
Reward money. Ten grand a victim.

1:38:20.250 --> 1:38:24.250
So, the more murders he confessed to,
the more money you'd make?

1:38:25.750 --> 1:38:27.667
Well, might as well take credit
for all of them.

1:38:27.667 --> 1:38:29.042
Make a little extra money.

1:38:29.042 --> 1:38:31.292
It was a lot of extra money.

1:38:33.958 --> 1:38:38.792
And regardless of what you think,
Albert convinced me he killed those women.

1:38:41.167 --> 1:38:42.417
Was it all 13?

1:38:44.292 --> 1:38:45.542
What does it really matter?

1:38:47.958 --> 1:38:52.125
See, you all created a myth,
and it needed to be stopped.

1:38:54.125 --> 1:38:55.542
People wanted to believe it was Al,

1:38:55.542 --> 1:38:58.292
but they needed to believe
that it was Albert.

1:39:00.125 --> 1:39:02.125
The alternative was just too disturbin'.

1:39:04.875 --> 1:39:05.958
What's that?

1:39:08.750 --> 1:39:10.750
There are many Albert DeSalvos out there.

1:39:13.208 --> 1:39:15.292
And your safe little world
is just a delusion.

1:39:19.542 --> 1:39:20.708
Men kill women.

1:39:22.458 --> 1:39:23.875
It didn't start with Albert.

1:39:25.625 --> 1:39:27.542
Sure as hell doesn't end with him either.

1:39:45.667 --> 1:39:48.250
[Loretta] <i>If Dr. Grayson was right
about these killers having a type--</i>

1:39:49.208 --> 1:39:51.625
The first five murders
were all elderly women.

1:39:52.667 --> 1:39:54.958
- <i>And if Paul Dempsey had a type...</i>
- [shutter clicks]

1:39:54.958 --> 1:39:56.708
It was elderly women.

1:39:56.708 --> 1:39:59.625
[Loretta] <i>DeSalvo was a pathological liar.</i>

1:40:00.458 --> 1:40:03.958
<i>Everything he knew about the first five
murders had either been in the papers,</i>

1:40:03.958 --> 1:40:06.000
<i>or it was given to him by Bottomly.</i>

1:40:07.708 --> 1:40:10.208
<i>But of the hundreds of women
DeSalvo assaulted,</i>

1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:12.833
all his victims were young.

1:40:13.875 --> 1:40:16.042
<i>And then Paul Dempsey moves on
to New York,</i>

1:40:16.667 --> 1:40:18.583
<i>and the Strangler starts killing
younger women.</i>

1:40:20.750 --> 1:40:23.458
<i>Then other men use the Strangler as cover
to get rid of women</i>

1:40:23.458 --> 1:40:25.042
<i>they didn't want around anymore.</i>

1:40:25.667 --> 1:40:27.417
<i>The boss who got his secretary pregnant.</i>

1:40:28.458 --> 1:40:30.042
<i>The psychotic ex-boyfriend.</i>

1:40:33.667 --> 1:40:37.333
<i>Then DeSalvo ends up at Bridgewater
with Nassar and Marsh.</i>

1:40:38.667 --> 1:40:40.000
<i>They use DeSalvo.</i>

1:40:40.708 --> 1:40:43.917
<i>Nassar gets F. Lee Bailey involved
so he can claim the reward money.</i>

1:40:44.500 --> 1:40:47.167
And they coached DeSalvo
before he confessed.

1:40:48.417 --> 1:40:50.875
He just became a convenient way out
for everybody else.

1:40:51.542 --> 1:40:53.708
<i>The entire city just wanted to move on.</i>

1:40:59.917 --> 1:41:01.750
<i>Nobody bothered to get to the truth.</i>

1:41:04.583 --> 1:41:06.167
[engine starts]

1:41:08.625 --> 1:41:10.417
<i>And people got away with murder.</i>

1:41:51.333 --> 1:41:52.833
[Jack] It's nice work, kid.

1:42:11.208 --> 1:42:12.500
Commissioner, Commissioner!

1:42:12.500 --> 1:42:15.708
What is your response to the story
in the <i>Record American</i> today?

1:42:15.708 --> 1:42:17.625
Commissioner, what is your response?

1:42:19.292 --> 1:42:22.917
All the Strangler murders
are still open cases.

1:42:22.917 --> 1:42:24.333
I'll leave it at that.

1:42:25.167 --> 1:42:27.083
[reporters clamoring]

1:42:27.083 --> 1:42:28.292
[reporter] Commissioner!

1:42:29.042 --> 1:42:30.375
How many suspects do you have?

1:42:38.792 --> 1:42:39.792
[sighs]

1:43:11.875 --> 1:43:13.875
[chattering]
