dumb magazine?                  

01:16.977 --> 01:19.610
         Why? To show your dumb 
         husband a thing or two.

01:19.612 --> 01:21.212
             I got a quarter bet
             with him here      

01:21.214 --> 01:24.248
     that Harvey Haddox pitched 
     a perfect no-hit ball game.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.449
Archie, he pitched              
a perfect game                  

01:25.451 --> 01:26.651
for 12 innings.                 

01:26.653 --> 01:28.586
They got a hit off him          
in the 13th,                    

01:28.588 --> 01:29.587
and he lost the game.           

01:29.589 --> 01:30.588
That's not a perfect game.      

01:30.590 --> 01:32.256
            I can still remember
                the headline    

01:32.258 --> 01:33.725
      out of that article there:

01:33.727 --> 01:36.961
"The day that Harvey Haddox was 
  robbed of the no-hit game."   

01:36.963 --> 01:40.865
That's right! He was robbed     
of the no-hit game,             

01:40.867 --> 01:42.500
so he didn't pitch              
the no-hit game.                

01:42.502 --> 01:44.202
            Certainly he did!   

01:44.204 --> 01:45.536
            If you was robbed   
                 of something,  

01:45.538 --> 01:47.338
              you had to have it
              in the first place

01:47.340 --> 01:49.007
    in order to have somebody   
             rob you of it.
