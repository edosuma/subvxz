WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:03.271
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE CLOSER"...
JUST GOT AN ADVANCED COPY

00:03.304 --> 00:04.672
OF THE DEPARTMENT'S
NEW ORGANIZATIONAL CHART.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.807
YOU WILL BE DIRECTING
ALL OF YOUR INQUIRIES

00:06.840 --> 00:08.809
TO NEW ASSISTANT CHIEF
RUSSELL TAYLOR.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.278
Delk: CHIEF JOHNSON

00:10.311 --> 00:12.146
DID MAJOR CRIMES
INVESTIGATE THE MURDERS

00:12.180 --> 00:13.747
OF AN ELDERLY
CONVENIENCE-STORE OWNER

00:13.781 --> 00:15.816
AND HIS 8-YEAR-OLD GRANDSON,

00:15.849 --> 00:18.819
REFERRED TO AS
THE "SHOOTIN' NEWTON" MURDERS?
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

00:18.852 --> 00:22.123
TURELL'S MOTHER HAS FILED
A CIVIL SUIT AGAINST THE CITY,

00:22.156 --> 00:24.592
THE L.A.P.D., CHIEF POPE,
YOURSELF,

00:24.625 --> 00:26.227
AND EVERY MEMBER
OF YOUR DIVISION

00:26.260 --> 00:28.796
FOR THE WRONGFUL DEATH
OF TURELL BAYLOR.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.298
HOW ABOUT I JUST QUIT?

00:30.331 --> 00:32.166
THEN I'LL TIE THIS LAWSUIT
AROUND YOUR NECK

00:32.200 --> 00:33.701
AND TELL THE CITY ATTORNEY

00:33.734 --> 00:35.736
THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO TURELL BAYLOR
WAS A CONSEQUENCE

00:35.769 --> 00:38.339
OF YOUR OWN
PERSONAL ACTIONS.

00:40.574 --> 00:41.809
CHIEF!
CHIEF!

00:41.842 --> 00:43.411
CHIEF, YOU OKAY?
CHIEF!

00:43.444 --> 00:46.114
THIS IS DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON,
MAJOR CRIMES.

00:46.147 --> 00:49.117
GOT AN OFFICER DOWN. REPEAT --
WE HAVE AN OFFICER DOWN!

00:55.489 --> 00:58.192
Quintero:
DURING HIS YEARS OF SERVICE,

00:58.226 --> 01:03.097
CHIEF THOMAS DELK EMBODIED THE
CORE VALUES OF THE L.A.P.D. --

01:03.131 --> 01:06.734
TO SERVE AND PROTECT.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.303
THE ANEURYSM
THAT CUT SHORT HIS LIFE

01:09.337 --> 01:10.771
HAS ALSO ROBBED US OF HIS VISION

01:10.804 --> 01:14.142
FOR OUR CITY'S FUTURE
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.809
CHIEF DELK WAS A FAMILY MAN,

01:15.843 --> 01:19.547
AND HE BROUGHT THE SAME LEVEL
OF COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION

01:19.580 --> 01:23.184
TO HIS SECOND FAMILY,
THE L.A.P.D.

01:23.217 --> 01:26.587
AND I KNOW HE WOULD AGREE
THAT IN OUR INTERIM CHIEF,

01:26.620 --> 01:29.423
THE TORCH HAS PASSED
TO A WORTHY LEADER,

01:29.457 --> 01:31.725
ONE WHO WILL GUIDE US
THROUGH THIS NEXT

01:31.759 --> 01:34.595
AND EVEN MORE DIFFICULT
TRANSITION.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.364
CHIEF WILLIAM POPE.

01:36.397 --> 01:39.833
WILL?

01:50.711 --> 01:54.382
Pope: TODAY IS NOT ABOUT
OUR FUTURE PURPOSE,

01:54.415 --> 01:56.284
BUT OUR PRESENT LOSS

01:56.317 --> 02:00.388
AND THE TOO-SHORT LIFE OF A
30-YEAR VETERAN OF THE L.A.P.D.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.589
THE KING IS DEAD.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.591
YEAH.
LONG LIVE THE POPE.

02:03.624 --> 02:07.361
I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING
CLOSELY WITH CHIEF DELK

02:07.395 --> 02:10.898
DURING THE FEW MONTHS
OF HIS TOO-SHORT TENURE.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.203
ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT...

02:15.236 --> 02:18.272
AND THE CITY,
I OFFER TOMMY'S WIFE, NICOLE,

02:18.306 --> 02:22.210
AND HIS SONS,
CARLTON AND TOMMY JR.,

02:22.243 --> 02:24.245
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES.

02:28.249 --> 02:31.252
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
LET US PRAY.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.765
Flynn: HOW LONG YOU THINK
THE COMMANDER'S

02:44.798 --> 02:46.634
GONNA STARE
INTO THAT GRAVE?

02:46.667 --> 02:49.503
YOU GUYS MIGHT WANT
TO CONSIDER PUTTING
TAYLOR ON SUICIDE WATCH.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.872
DELK WAS HIS ONLY WAY UP.
POOR GUY.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.807
Provenza: YEAH,
IT'S A REAL TRAGEDY.

02:53.841 --> 02:56.210
FLYNN, LEND ME A HANKY.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.482
MAJOR CRIMES.
DETECTIVE GABRIEL.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.916
UH, CHIEF POPE?

03:02.950 --> 03:04.452
LISTEN,
I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU

03:04.485 --> 03:05.786
THE MAYOR APPOINTED ME
INTERIM CHIEF,

03:05.819 --> 03:07.388
BUT I JUST FOUND OUT MYSELF

03:07.421 --> 03:08.822
IN THE CAR
ON THE WAY FROM THE CHURCH.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.592
SO, I-I GUESS THIS MEANS
THAT COMMANDER TAYLOR

03:11.625 --> 03:13.627
IS NOT GOING TO BE
ASSISTANT CHIEF?

03:13.661 --> 03:15.329
THAT'D BE
A PRETTY GOOD GUESS. YEAH.

03:15.363 --> 03:17.898
BUDGET SAVINGS, ANYWAY,
IN MY KEEPING BOTH POSITIONS.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.633
SO WE'RE BACK TO NORMAL?

03:19.667 --> 03:21.902
WELL, AS LONG AS THERE'S THE
WORD "INTERIM" IN FRONT "CHIEF,"

03:21.935 --> 03:23.637
I NEED TO MOVE CAREFULLY.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.839
BUT EVENTUALLY, YEAH.
A-AND WHAT ABOUT, UH,

03:25.873 --> 03:27.475
CAPTAIN RAYDOR'S
INVESTIGATION

03:27.508 --> 03:29.477
INTO MAJOR CRIMES,
THE SHOOTIN' NEWTON CASE?

03:29.510 --> 03:30.678
IS THAT OVER, TOO?

03:30.711 --> 03:32.480
Gabriel: CHIEF?
UH, ONE SECOND.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.814
YEAH.

03:33.847 --> 03:37.618
CHIEF?
WE CAUGHT A MURDER.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.889
CHIEF

03:41.922 --> 03:43.591
YES, DETECTIVE. MURDER.

03:43.624 --> 03:47.461
WHERE?
Flynn:
OVER HERE, CHIEF!

03:50.798 --> 03:52.633
HOW'D Y'ALL
GET HERE SO FAST?

03:52.666 --> 03:54.702
DID YOU TAKE THE FREEWAY?
SEPULVEDA.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.437
ANYWAY,
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO,

03:56.470 --> 04:00.408
OFFICERS RESPONDED TO A 911 CALL
FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.610
WHEN THEY ENTERED,
THEY FOUND THE VICTIM --

04:02.643 --> 04:04.545
FEMALE, EARLY 20s --
DEAD FOR DAYS.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.514
WHO CALLED THIS IN?

04:06.547 --> 04:08.449
THAT WOULD BE THE HOMEOWNERS,
DANIEL AND EMILY DIXON.

04:08.482 --> 04:09.717
THAT'S THEIR SON, JESSE.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.552
THEY JUST RETURNED
FROM VACATION

04:11.585 --> 04:14.322
TO FIND THEIR HOME BURGLARIZED
AND THEIR HOUSE-SITTER DEAD.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.490
THE, UM, VICTIM'S NAME
IS ASHLEY REED.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.759
SHE WAS FOUND
BY MRS. DIXON.

04:18.792 --> 04:21.429
UH, EXCUSE ME,
UH, DETECTIVE?

04:21.462 --> 04:23.397
OH, UH, NO.
UM, SORRY, MR. DIXON.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.633
THE PERSON THAT
YOU'D BE LOOKING FOR --

04:25.666 --> 04:27.435
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.703
MR. DIXON, WOULD YOU MIND
TELLING ME WHAT Y'ALL DID

04:29.737 --> 04:30.938
WHEN YOU FIRST GOT HOME?

04:30.971 --> 04:32.072
DID YOU TOUCH ANYTHING?

04:32.105 --> 04:34.342
NO, NO.
UM, I DON'T KNOW.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.076
LIKE I TOLD THE OFFICER,

04:36.109 --> 04:38.646
MY, UH, SON JUST GRADUATED
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

04:38.679 --> 04:42.049
WE TOOK HIM TO HAWAII
FOR 10 DAYS, UH, GOT BACK.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.352
HE WAS GETTING THE BAGS
OUT OF THE CAR,

04:44.385 --> 04:45.719
AND I HEARD MY WIFE SCREAM.

04:45.753 --> 04:49.657
I RAN IN, AND, UH,
AND I SAW ASHLEY.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.592
ASHLEY
WAS YOUR HOUSE

04:51.625 --> 04:53.026
SHE WASN'T
JUST A HOUSE-SITTER.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.896
HER MOTHER AND I ARE BEST
FRIENDS SINCE COLLEGE.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.332
I'VE KNOWN
ASHLEY SINCE SHE WAS A BABY.

04:58.366 --> 04:59.633
SHE WAS FAMILY.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.635
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS MY FAULT.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.671
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
I'M THE ONE
WHO ASKED HER TO STAY!

05:03.704 --> 05:04.938
OH, MY GOD.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.607
ASHLEY'S FAMILY'S
ALL IN CHICAGO.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.075
WHAT AM I
GONNA TELL HER MOTHER?

05:08.108 --> 05:10.077
BETTER LET US
DEAL WITH THAT, MA'AM.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.714
UM,
I'M GONNA LOOK INSIDE NOW,

05:13.747 --> 05:17.084
BUT IF YOU COULD KEEP TALKING
TO, UH, LIEUTENANT PROVENZA HERE

05:17.117 --> 05:19.052
ABOUT ASHLEY, WE'D LIKE
TO LEARN EVERYTHING WE CAN.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.689
I'M SORRY.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.724
THANK YOU.

05:23.757 --> 05:26.026
I'M...
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD AT...

05:26.059 --> 05:28.496
I PUT A BLANKET
OVER HERE.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.698
I JUST...
COULDN'T STAND THE THOUGHT

05:30.731 --> 05:32.833
OF ANYBODY SEEING ASHLEY
LIKE THAT.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.802
L

05:35.636 --> 05:38.406
OKAY, BUZZ. COME ON.
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.514
WAS IT THE FALL
THAT KILLED HER?

05:46.547 --> 05:49.550
HER NECK'S BROKEN, BUT ANYTHING
ELSE I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.819
THERE'S A LOT OF DECOMP.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.954
SHE'S BEEN DEAD
A GOOD FOUR OR FIVE DAYS.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.122
SHE'S PRACTICALLY NAKED.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.691
HER SHIRT'S TORN.

05:57.725 --> 05:58.992
ANY SIGN OF SEXUAL ASSAULT?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.994
HARD TO TELL ON A BODY
IN THIS CONDITION.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.763
YOU'LL HAVE TO
ASK THE DOCTOR.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.165
YEAH, THAT'S HER.
ASHLEY REED.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.901
GOT HER ILLINOIS
DRIVER'S LICENSE

06:07.935 --> 06:09.803
AND HER STUDENT I.D.
FROM USC.

06:09.837 --> 06:12.773
I ALSO FOUND HER CELLPHONE IN
A SUITCASE FULL OF CLOTHES

06:12.806 --> 06:14.074
IN THE DOWNSTAIRS
GUEST ROOM.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.977
WHAT WAS SHE DOING UPSTAIRS?

06:18.579 --> 06:19.713
WOW.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.582
THIS IS WORSE
THAN THE MASTER BEDROOM.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.050
WELL, HE IS A TEENAGER.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.719
SOME OF THIS MESS IS PROBABLY
FROM BEFORE THE BREAK-IN.

06:25.753 --> 06:28.956
BUT, LOOK, FLAT-SCREEN TV
IS STILL HERE.

06:28.989 --> 06:32.025
SO IS THE STEREO.
AND THE XBOX.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.627
IF THIS IS WHAT
THEY LEFT BEHIND...

06:33.661 --> 06:34.895
...WHAT DID THEY TAKE?

06:37.531 --> 06:38.899
Tao: CELL?

06:38.932 --> 06:41.469
YEAH.
BATTERY'S DEAD.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.637
NOT A PROBLEM.

06:43.671 --> 06:44.805
NO SIGN OF FORCED ENTRY,
CHIEF.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.541
WELL, IF IT WASN'T A BREAK-IN,

06:47.575 --> 06:49.677
WHO WOULD ASHLEY OPEN THE DOOR
FOR DRESSED LIKE THIS?

06:49.710 --> 06:51.812
THE, UH, DIXONS' STORY
SEEMS LEGIT.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.448
THEY SHOWED ME THEIR PLANE
TICKETS TO MAUI,

06:54.482 --> 06:57.117
AND THEN I HAD THEM OPEN UP
THOSE FANCY SUITCASES.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.719
AND DID YOU SEE
THOSE SUNBURNS?

06:58.752 --> 07:00.721
I MEAN, GUESS THEY NEVER
HEARD OF SKIN CANCER.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.022
LET'S JUST MAKE SURE
THAT THEY WEREN'T HERE

07:02.055 --> 07:03.857
DURING THE TIME
OF THE MURDER,

07:03.891 --> 07:06.760
SO CHECK THE AIRPORTS
AND THE HOTEL IN MAUI.

07:06.794 --> 07:09.897
CHIEF, THE HOUSE HAS DEFINITELY
BEEN PICKED OVER,

07:09.930 --> 07:11.499
BUT THEY DIDN'T BOTHER
WITH THE BIG-TICKET ITEMS.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.166
MAYBE
THEY WERE INTERRUPTED.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.835
Sanchez:
I DON'T KNOW, CHIEF.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.905
THIS BURGLARY
LOOKS REALLY AMATEUR.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.675
YEAH, SO, MAYBE
SOMEBODY RAPES ASHLEY,

07:21.709 --> 07:23.877
THROWS HER OVER THE RAIL,
AND THEN JUST STAGED THE SCENE.

07:25.579 --> 07:26.847
I GOT ASHLEY'S PHONE WORKING.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.181
THE LAST FEW DAYS,

07:28.215 --> 07:31.118
SHE'S RECEIVED
LOTS OF THE SAME TEXT MESSAGES.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.953
"WHERE ARE YOU?"

07:32.986 --> 07:34.588
HOWEVER, THE LAST MESSAGES
SHE REPLIED TO WERE SENT --

07:34.622 --> 07:35.789
FIVE DAYS AGO?

07:35.823 --> 07:37.090
EXACTLY.

07:37.124 --> 07:40.193
4:30 P.M. FROM A. BANKS,
"PICK YOU UP AT 6:30?"

07:40.227 --> 07:42.029
TO WHICH ASHLEY REPLIED,
"GREAT."

07:42.062 --> 07:46.634
AND THEN AT 9:14 P.M.,
ANOTHER ONE FROM A. BANKS.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.502
"HOW WAS BEDTIME?"

07:48.536 --> 07:50.070
ASHLEY WROTE BACK,
"ALL IS WELL.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.672
KIDS ARE ASLEEP.
HAVE FUN."

07:51.705 --> 07:53.173
SO, SHE WAS
HOUSE-SITTING HERE

07:53.206 --> 07:54.908
AND BABYSITTING
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

07:54.942 --> 07:58.679
OKAY, SO, WE HAVE A PHONE NUMBER
FOR AN A. BANKS.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.080
CAN WE GET AN ADDRESS?

08:03.283 --> 08:05.252
MRS. BANKS?

08:05.285 --> 08:06.720
GOOD MORNING.
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF --

08:06.754 --> 08:07.988
OH, GOD.
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:08.021 --> 08:09.523
IS IT ALEX?

08:09.557 --> 08:11.725
ALEX?
IS THAT YOUR HUSBAND?

08:11.759 --> 08:14.261
YES. YES.
WAS THERE AN ACCIDENT?

08:14.294 --> 08:16.630
UH, NO, MA'AM.
SORRY TO ALARM YOU.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.233
WE JUST WANT TO ASK YOU A FEW
QUESTIONS ABOUT ASHLEY REED.

08:20.267 --> 08:23.804
ASHLEY?
SHE'S ONE OF ALEX'S STUDENTS.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.639
HE'S A JOURNALISM
PROFESSOR.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.775
AND DOES ASHLEY
ALSO BABYSIT FOR YOU?

08:27.808 --> 08:29.743
LIKE LAST WEDNESDAY EVENING,
FOR EXAMPLE?

08:29.777 --> 08:31.278
UH, YES.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.680
MY HUSBAND AND I WENT TO DINNER
FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY.

08:32.713 --> 08:33.947
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

08:33.981 --> 08:36.049
AND HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM MS. REED SINCE?

08:36.083 --> 08:38.586
NO, NOT SINCE
ALEX DROVE HER HOME.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.090
OH, GOD.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.626
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

08:45.659 --> 08:47.895
IS ASHLEY
FILING A COMPLAINT?

08:47.928 --> 08:49.096
MA'AM?

08:49.129 --> 08:50.798
OH, MY GOD.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.633
THIS IS WHY HE POURED ME
THAT EXTRA WINE AT DINNER.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.269
HOW COULD I BE SO STUPID?

08:56.303 --> 09:00.073
HE HASN'T SAID A THING ABOUT HER
FOR ALMOST A WEEK.

09:00.107 --> 09:03.043
I'M SORRY. I...I HAVE TO
CALL HIM RIGHT AWAY.

09:03.076 --> 09:06.213
MRS. BANKS, MAY I COME IN
FOR A MOMENT, JUST TO TALK?

09:08.015 --> 09:09.850
THANK YOU.

09:09.883 --> 09:10.918
THE HUSBAND?

09:10.951 --> 09:13.153
YES. FIND HIM.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.825
Raydor: SO, TURELL BAYLOR
CONFESSED TO THE MURDER

09:17.858 --> 09:19.126
OF 74-YEAR-OLD
CHARLIE NILES

09:19.159 --> 09:20.994
AND HIS 8-YEAR-OLD GRANDSON,
CHRIS.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.363
THIS CASE COULD NOT BE
PROSECUTED, HOWEVER,

09:23.396 --> 09:25.733
BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW,
AT YOUR REQUEST,

09:25.766 --> 09:28.335
THE D.A.'S OFFICE HAD GIVEN
MR. BAYLOR IMMUNITY

09:28.368 --> 09:30.237
IN EXCHANGE
FOR HIS STATEMENT.

09:30.270 --> 09:33.373
CHIEF JOHNSON THEN RELEASED
MR. BAYLOR AT HIS HOME.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.008
LATER THAT DAY,

09:35.042 --> 09:37.778
HE WAS FOUND BEATEN TO DEATH
BEHIND HIS RESIDENCE.

09:37.811 --> 09:40.113
BUT CHIEF JOHNSON'S CONDUCT
DURING THIS INVESTIGATION,

09:40.147 --> 09:41.314
AND THAT OF HER DIVISION,

09:41.348 --> 09:44.818
FELL ENTIRELY WITHIN
CALIFORNIA STATE LAW

09:44.852 --> 09:48.055
AND THE RULES AND POLICY
OF THE L.A.P.D.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.156
CASE CLOSED.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.158
I AM DONE.

09:51.191 --> 09:54.061
I GOT TO SAY, CAPTAIN,
ON THE FACE OF IT,

09:54.094 --> 09:56.930
THIS AUDIT SEEMS
INCREDIBLY SUPERFICIAL.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.766
SIR?

09:58.799 --> 10:01.368
I WANT YOU TO GO BACK DOWN
TO MAJOR CRIMES,

10:01.401 --> 10:03.971
INTERVIEW EVERYONE, AND MAKE
SURE WE HAVE NO VULNERABILITIES.

10:05.673 --> 10:08.241
WE ALWAYS
HAVE VULNERABILITIES.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.877
OKAY.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.780
IF YOU WANT FURTHER ANALYSIS
OF OUR LEGAL DEFENSE,

10:12.813 --> 10:15.282
THEN I THINK
THE CITY ATTORNEY --

10:15.315 --> 10:19.019
NO. I'M NOT OPENING OUR FILES
TO AN OUTSIDERS. PERIOD.

10:19.052 --> 10:22.155
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH CHIEF
JOHNSON IS ALREADY COMPLICATED.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.423
YEAH, WELL,
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO DECIDED

10:23.456 --> 10:25.058
ON A CAREER
IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.761
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY,

10:27.795 --> 10:29.663
BUT OBVIOUSLY DROPPING
TURELL BAYLOR OFF

10:29.697 --> 10:31.064
IN FRONT OF ANGRY
GANG MEMBERS

10:31.098 --> 10:32.933
WAS NOT CHIEF JOHNSON'S
FINEST HOUR.

10:32.966 --> 10:37.037
AND INSISTING ON IMMUNITY FOR
A CHILD KILLER WAS NOT YOURS.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.974
LISTEN, CAPTAIN.

10:41.008 --> 10:44.077
I PLAN ON KEEPING THIS JOB.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.413
PART OF THAT PLAN
IS MAKING SURE THIS LAWSUIT

10:46.446 --> 10:48.415
DOES NOT REFLECT BADLY
ON THE L.A.P.D.

10:48.448 --> 10:53.653
YOU WILL GO BACK DOWN TO MAJOR
CRIMES AND FINISH YOUR AUDIT.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.197
SEEING THAT
I AM LEGALLY PROHIBITED

11:04.231 --> 11:06.800
FROM DISCUSSING
WITH CHIEF JOHNSON

11:06.834 --> 11:09.302
WHY I AM HAUNTING
HER MURDER ROOM,

11:09.336 --> 11:13.340
WOULD YOU PERHAPS
CONSIDER TELLING HER

11:13.373 --> 11:16.910
THAT I AM THERE
UNDER DIRECT ORDERS FROM YOU?

11:16.944 --> 11:18.946
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:18.979 --> 11:21.815
Gabriel: THIS IS THE WORST PART
OF MY JOB.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.283
GREAT TO SEE YOU AS WELL,
DETECTIVE.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.752
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.153
NOW, THERE'S NOT MUCH
I CAN TELL YOU.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.455
FIVE DAYS ON THE FLOOR
EVEN WITH THE A.C. RUNNING,

11:28.488 --> 11:30.290
THE BODY'S
IN TERRIBLE CONDITION.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.325
THE INTRACRANIAL BLEEDING
AND THE BROKEN NECK

11:32.359 --> 11:33.727
ARE CONSISTENT WITH A FALL.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.863
BUT LOOK.

11:35.896 --> 11:39.199
BRUISING ON THE BICEP
THAT APPEARS TO BE PERIMORTEM.

11:39.232 --> 11:42.435
SHE WAS GRABBED...TRYING TO GET
AWAY FROM HER KILLER, MAYBE.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.171
OR BEING
THROWN OFF THE LANDING.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.508
A

11:48.541 --> 11:50.443
NO EVIDENCE OF FOREIGN
BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS,

11:50.477 --> 11:52.846
THOUGH SHE WAS DEAD FOR SO LONG
BEFORE YOU FOUND HER,

11:52.880 --> 11:54.214
I CAN'T RULE IT OUT.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.448
WHEN YOU OPENED HER UP,

11:55.482 --> 11:57.217
COULD YOU SEE
IF MS. REED WAS PREGNANT

11:57.250 --> 11:58.485
OR RECENTLY HAD AN ABORTION?

11:58.518 --> 12:00.153
YOU KNOW SOMETHING I DON'T?

12:00.187 --> 12:02.422
ASHLEY WAS BABYSITTING
FOR ONE OF HER PROFESSORS,

12:02.455 --> 12:04.057
A MR. ALEX BANKS,

12:04.091 --> 12:05.025
THE MAN WHO DROVE HER HOME
THE NIGHT SHE DIED.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.860
AND ACCORDING TO HIS WIFE,

12:06.894 --> 12:09.863
THE PROFESSOR HAD AN AFFAIR WITH
ANOTHER STUDENT 10 MONTHS AGO.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.298
HOW'D THE WIFE FIND OUT?

12:11.331 --> 12:14.001
THE PROFESSOR PAID
FOR THE YOUNG WOMAN'S ABORTION

12:14.034 --> 12:15.302
ON HIS CREDIT CARD.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.004
HMM. CARELESS.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.105
THAT'S WHY IT'S A GOOD IDEA
TO KEEP CASH AROUND THE HOUSE.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.340
SO YOU THINK ASHLEY HERE

12:20.373 --> 12:22.342
MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE PROFESSOR'S
LATEST GIRLFRIEND?

12:22.375 --> 12:24.211
MAYBE SHE JUST
FOUND HIM MORE RESISTIBLE.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.947
THE LAST ONE HE KNOCKED UP.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.282
THIS ONE HE KNOCKED DOWN.

12:33.987 --> 12:38.058
AH. EVERYTHING ABOUT THE DIXON
MAUI TRIP CHECKS OUT.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.326
THEIR ALIBI HOLDS.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.061
SO, I HAD THE FAMILY
GIVE ME A LIST

12:41.094 --> 12:43.263
OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS STOLEN
FROM THE HOUSE, CHIEF.

12:43.296 --> 12:44.865
THANK YOU.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.399
Tao: I DOUBT WE'LL RECOVER
ANY OF IT, CHIEF, BUT, UH,

12:46.433 --> 12:48.201
I'M PUTTING IT INTO THE STOLEN
PROPERTY SYSTEM JUST IN CASE.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.370
CHIEF, I GOT
PROFESSOR A. BANKS MIRANDIZED

12:50.403 --> 12:52.339
AND WAITING FOR YOU
IN INTERVIEW 1.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.107
I, UH, TOOK HIS CELLPHONE,

12:54.141 --> 12:56.309
SO HE HASN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO SPEAK TO HIS WIFE,

12:56.343 --> 12:57.544
BUT HE'S GOT
LOTS OF QUESTIONS.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.279
YEAH, SO DO I.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.981
CHIEF. CHIEF!

13:01.014 --> 13:03.884
COULD YOU HANG ON THERE
JUST ONE SECOND?

13:03.917 --> 13:06.253
W-WHAT'S THE MATTER,
LIEUTENANT?

13:06.286 --> 13:07.955
UM...CAPTAIN RAYDOR.

13:07.988 --> 13:10.891
AND I KNOW YOU ASKED ME TO GIVE
HER EVERYTHING SHE NEEDS,

13:10.924 --> 13:13.894
BUT NOW SHE WANTS TO INTERVIEW
EVERY MEMBER OF OUR DIVISION,

13:13.927 --> 13:15.362
STARTING WITH ME.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.464
I'M TELLING YOU, THE GUYS
ARE STARTING TO ASK QUESTIONS.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.566
CHIEF...

13:19.599 --> 13:21.368
WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?

13:21.401 --> 13:23.070
I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.105
CAPTAIN RAYDOR, MAY I SPEAK
WITH YOU FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?

13:25.138 --> 13:28.108
OH, OF COURSE.
YES.
THANK YOU.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.979
WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE?

13:32.012 --> 13:34.514
I AM CONDUCTING
A TRANSPARENCY AUDIT

13:34.547 --> 13:37.017
ON THE
SHOOTIN' NEWTON MURDERS.

13:37.050 --> 13:40.253
ORDERED BY CHIEF DELK,
AND HE'S DEAD.

13:40.287 --> 13:43.423
I'M POSITIVE THAT CHIEF POPE
WILL REVERSE THAT DECISION.

13:45.058 --> 13:47.094
BUT UNTIL I AM ORDERED TO LEAVE,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

13:47.127 --> 13:52.132
UNTIL I AM ORDERED TO LEAVE,
THEN I MUST PROCEED.

13:52.165 --> 13:55.102
I NEED TO INTERVIEW EVERY MEMBER
OF YOUR DIVISION,

13:55.135 --> 13:57.637
INCLUDING COMMANDER TAYLOR
AND BUZZ WATSON, STARTING NOW,

13:57.670 --> 13:59.372
AS LONG
AS IT DOESN'T INTERFERE

13:59.406 --> 14:03.043
WITH THE PROPER EXECUTION
OF THEIR DUTIES.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.414
ALL RIGHT THEN.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.449
UH, DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,
PLEASE GET A WARRANT

14:09.482 --> 14:11.885
TO SEARCH THE PROFESSOR'S HOME,
CAR, AND OFFICE.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.922
AND, UH, TAKE BUZZ ALONG WITH
YOU TO DOCUMENT EVERYTHING.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.189
BUT YOU HAVE
AN INTERVIEW, CHIEF.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.158
SHOULDN'T I --
NO. THANK YOU.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.193
AND, COMMANDER TAYLOR,
ARE YOU HERE?

14:20.227 --> 14:21.929
Taylor:
YEAH, I'M HERE, CHIEF.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.330
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.965
UM, I'D LIKE YOU TO SUPERVISE
THE REST OF THE SQUAD

14:24.998 --> 14:26.233
ON A GRID SEARCH.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.501
PLEASE GET COPIES
OF THE THEFT REPORTS

14:28.535 --> 14:31.238
AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
THE DIXONS' STOLEN PROPERTY

14:31.271 --> 14:33.974
ANYWHERE BETWEEN THEIR HOME
AND THE PROFESSOR'S.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.276
YES, MA'AM.
A-A GRID SEARCH.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.545
BREAKS UP MY DAY
A LITTLE.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.349
IS THIS GRID SEARCH
REALLY NECESSARY?

14:42.382 --> 14:45.618
IF THE BURGLARY WAS A COVER-UP
FOR ASHLEY REED'S MURDER,

14:45.652 --> 14:47.921
THEN THE KILLER OR KILLERS
WOULD HAVE DUMPED THE ITEMS

14:47.955 --> 14:49.089
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.190
YOU'RE SENDING
YOUR ENTIRE DIVISION

14:50.223 --> 14:51.591
ON A CITYWIDE SCAVENGER HUNT

14:51.624 --> 14:53.393
IN ORDER TO FRUSTRATE
MY INVESTIGATION.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.561
YOUR INVESTIGATION
IS GOING TO BE HISTORY

14:54.594 --> 14:56.463
THE MOMENT
I BRIEF CHIEF POPE.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.966
WELL, I'D LOVE TO BE A FLY ON
THE WALL FOR THAT CONVERSATION.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.901
MAKE SURE YOU LET ME KNOW
WHAT POPE SAYS.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.976
PROFESSOR BANKS?

15:09.009 --> 15:11.979
I'M SO SORRY
TO HAVE KEPT YOU WAITING.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.313
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.548
I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR DROPPING IN.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.951
I
DIDN'T DROP IN. I WAS
PRACTICALLY ARRESTED.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.686
WHEN IS SOMEONE GONNA
TELL ME WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

15:19.719 --> 15:21.288
OH, I APOLOGIZE.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.522
UM...

15:22.555 --> 15:24.457
WE'RE CONDUCTING
AN INVESTIGATION,

15:24.491 --> 15:27.260
AND WE DIDN'T WANT ANY DETAILS
LEAKED TO THE PRESS.

15:27.294 --> 15:30.430
SO, I'M SURE BEING
A JOURNALISM PROFESSOR,
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.632
MAYBE IF WE WERE
IN SOVIET RUSSIA.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.334
PART OF MY CITIZENSHIP TEST

15:34.367 --> 15:36.669
COVERED THE OPENNESS
OF THE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM,

15:36.703 --> 15:39.272
SO I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT
SURPRISED TO BE DRAGGED DOWNTOWN

15:39.306 --> 15:40.974
ON SECRET POLICE BUSINESS.

15:41.008 --> 15:44.344
IT'S NOT A SECRET, AND YOU DID
GET YOUR RIGHTS READ TO YOU.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.747
ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH A YOUNG WOMAN

15:47.780 --> 15:49.149
BY THE NAME OF ASHLEY REED?

15:49.182 --> 15:50.417
"FAMILIAR"?

15:50.450 --> 15:51.751
YES, I'M FAMILIAR
WITH ASHLEY.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.686
SHE'S A STUDENT
IN MY JOURNALISM SEMINAR.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.455
I'M HER INDEPENDENT-STUDY
ADVISER.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.457
DO YOU HAVE A PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIP WITH HER,

15:57.490 --> 15:58.591
O

15:59.792 --> 16:02.395
SHE'S DONE SOME WORK
FOR MY FAMILY.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.332
SHE LOOKED AFTER YOUR
CHILDREN FOR YOU AND
YOUR WIFE LAST WEEK,

16:05.365 --> 16:07.634
IS THAT RIGHT?
YES.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.336
AND WHEN SHE WAS DONE?

16:09.369 --> 16:13.740
I DROVE HER BACK TO...

16:13.773 --> 16:16.376
WHERE SHE WAS HOUSE-SITTING
NEARBY, SO...

16:16.409 --> 16:17.644
AND WHEN
YOU DROPPED HER OFF,

16:17.677 --> 16:19.279
DID YOU BY ANY CHANCE
WALK HER TO THE DOOR?

16:21.648 --> 16:23.250
N-NO,
I DON'T BELIEVE I DID.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.617
JUST A SIMPLE QUESTION,
PROFESSOR.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.419
EITHER YOU WALKED HER
TO THE DOOR, OR YOU DIDN'T.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.488
I DIDN'T.

16:28.521 --> 16:32.792
SHE GOT OUT OF THE CAR,
AND I WENT STRAIGHT HOME.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.562
SO, YOU DIDN'T GO
INSIDE THE HOUSE WITH HER?
NO.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.297
YOU DIDN'T
TAKE HER CLOTHES OFF?

16:39.166 --> 16:40.300
GOD, NO.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.504
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT?

16:44.537 --> 16:47.174
HAS -- HAS ASHLEY
MADE A COMPLAINT?

16:47.207 --> 16:48.508
DO YOU HAVE A HISTORY
OF COMPLAINTS, SIR?

16:48.541 --> 16:51.144
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
YOUR QUESTION.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.512
WELL,
HOW ABOUT THIS, THEN --

16:52.545 --> 16:54.181
HAVE YOU EVER
HAD SEXUAL RELATIONS

16:54.214 --> 16:55.748
WITH ANY OF THE GIRLS
IN YOUR CLASS?

16:55.782 --> 16:58.651
OF COURSE NOT.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.054
SO, IF I WERE TO ASK
ALL YOUR CURRENT STUDENTS

17:01.088 --> 17:03.456
AND THE FORMER ONES THAT
QUESTION, THEY WOULD AGREE?

17:03.490 --> 17:04.791
ABSOLUTELY.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.393
NOW, THESE QUESTIONS
ARE INCREDIBLY PERSONAL,

17:06.426 --> 17:08.328
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT AT ALL.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.431
I'LL GIVE YOU THE HEADLINE.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.501
"CO-ED BRUTALLY SLAIN."

17:16.536 --> 17:19.206
NOT A PICTURE YOU CAN PUT
ON THE FRONT PAGE, I IMAGINE.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.276
NOW, TAKE A GOOD LOOK,
PROFESSOR, IF YOU WOULD.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.678
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THAT WOMAN?

17:25.712 --> 17:27.214
I KNOW IT MIGHT BE HARD

17:27.247 --> 17:29.682
'CAUSE SHE'S BEEN DEAD
FOR FIVE DAYS.

17:29.716 --> 17:33.220
ASHLEY'S...

17:33.253 --> 17:36.123
BEEN DEAD FOR FIVE DAYS?

17:36.156 --> 17:37.457
AND FROM WHAT
YOU JUST TOLD ME,

17:37.490 --> 17:39.292
YOU WERE THE LAST PERSON
TO SEE HER ALIVE.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.596
YOU CAN'T THINK I DID THIS.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.132
WELL, THE THOUGHT
CROSSED MY MIND,

17:45.165 --> 17:46.466
ESPECIALLY
SINCE YOU JUST LIED

17:46.499 --> 17:48.235
ABOUT HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH ONE OF YOUR STUDENTS

17:48.268 --> 17:49.569
AND THE ABORTION
YOU PAID FOR --

17:49.602 --> 17:52.772
AT LEAST IF WHAT YOUR WIFE
TELLS ME IS TRUE.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.108
YOU SPOKE TO SARA?

17:55.142 --> 17:57.177
OH, MY.
DID I JUST REVEAL MY SOURCE?

17:57.210 --> 17:58.278
OH, WELL.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.746
[ CLEARS THROAT,
SMACKS LIPS ]

17:59.779 --> 18:02.149
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT
ON THE MURDER OF ASHLEY REED,

18:02.182 --> 18:03.850
FOR THE RECORD?

18:08.688 --> 18:12.592
YES, SIR. IT --
IT IS A-A BIG TASK AHEAD.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.728
BUT, UH...UNDER THESE
UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES,

18:15.762 --> 18:17.697
I'M, UH,
I'M VERY GRATEFUL

18:17.730 --> 18:20.700
TO HAVE
SUCH SUPPORTIVE PARTNERS.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.535
OKAY.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.304
THANK YOU, SIR.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.838
OKAY. BYE-BYE.

18:25.872 --> 18:28.408
COULD YOU KNOCK,
JUST SINCE I'M CHIEF?

18:28.441 --> 18:29.376
INTERIM CHIEF.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.512
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?
YES.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.847
WHY DID YOU PULL
20 UNIFORMS OFF PATROL

18:34.881 --> 18:37.750
AND SEND THEM ON A GRID SEARCH
WITH YOUR ENTIRE DIVISION?

18:37.784 --> 18:39.752
BECAUSE I COULDN'T
GET A CONFESSION,

18:39.786 --> 18:42.489
AND IF THE SUSPECT FAKED
THE BURGLARY OF THE DIXON HOUSE

18:42.522 --> 18:44.657
TO COVER UP THE RAPE
AND MURDER OF MY VICTIM,

18:44.691 --> 18:47.460
THEN HE PROBABLY DUMPED WHATEVER
HE STOLE ON THE WAY HOME.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.429
SO, YOU SEND YOUR WHOLE SQUAD
OUT ON...

18:49.462 --> 18:50.663
LEGITIMATE POLICE BUSINESS

18:50.697 --> 18:53.233
AND NOT JUST
TO AVOID CAPTAIN RAYDOR?

18:53.266 --> 18:54.601
OH, WILL.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.669
PLEASE, PLEASE.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.605
CAN'T YOU JUST
MAKE HER GO AWAY?

18:58.638 --> 19:02.242
IT'S...INCONVENIENT.
I KNOW.

19:02.275 --> 19:05.345
LOOK, WHEN DELK
ASSIGNED RAYDOR THIS AUDIT,

19:05.378 --> 19:06.846
I OPENLY OPPOSED IT.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.816
BUT SINCE IT'S UNDERWAY NOW,
WE NEED TO SEE IT THROUGH.

19:09.849 --> 19:14.321
BY THE WAY, I SAW MYSELF
ON TV IN THE UNIFORM.

19:14.354 --> 19:17.224
WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME
I'D GOTTEN SO...

19:17.257 --> 19:19.326
SORRY. YOU'RE FAT.
FEEL BETTER?

19:19.359 --> 19:20.660
LOOK.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.595
I'M A LITTLE MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT CAPTAIN RAYDOR

19:22.629 --> 19:25.398
INTERVIEWING MY ENTIRE DIVISION
AND ASKING TAYLOR ABOUT ME.

19:25.432 --> 19:26.599
YEAH, I KNOW.
THAT'S ANNOYING.

19:26.633 --> 19:27.867
AND -- AND HOW MUCH LONGER

19:27.900 --> 19:29.536
IS HE GONNA STAY
IN THAT STUPID CUBICLE?

19:29.569 --> 19:31.804
BRENDA, LOOK, I CAN'T START
SHUFFLING PEOPLE AROUND

19:31.838 --> 19:33.873
UNTIL MY OWN SITUATION
IS SETTLED, OKAY?

19:33.906 --> 19:36.243
TAYLOR IS TEMPORARY.
RAYDOR IS TEMPORARY.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.977
UNLESS YOU WANT
SOMEBODY NEW COMING IN

19:38.010 --> 19:39.979
WHO MAY OR MAY NOT
DISMANTLE MAJOR CRIMES,

19:40.012 --> 19:42.582
WE NEED TO FOCUS
ON MAKING ME PERMANENT.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.317
WELL, WHAT'S THE POINT
OF BEING IN CHARGE

19:44.351 --> 19:45.885
IF YOU CAN'T CHANGE
ANYTHING BUT YOUR DIET?

19:45.918 --> 19:48.488
JUST BE PATIENT, WILL YOU?
I'M WORKING ON IT.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.756
THESE THINGS TAKE TIME.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.429
Taylor: YOU SPEND YOUR
WHOLE LIFE IN THE SYSTEM.

19:56.463 --> 19:59.432
YOU TRUST THAT YOUR HARD WORK
AND YEARS OF SERVICE

19:59.466 --> 20:02.869
ARE BEING RECOGNIZED AND -- AND
GOOD THINGS WILL COME TO YOU.

20:02.902 --> 20:06.873
THEN, POOF,
YOUR REWARD DROPS DEAD

20:06.906 --> 20:09.509
RIGHT IN FRONT
OF YOUR EYES.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.244
Should have
brought my own car.

20:11.278 --> 20:12.579
I PLAYED THE GAME.

20:12.612 --> 20:16.383
I-I-I PLAYED THE GAME
AS WELL AS ANYONE.

20:16.416 --> 20:19.886
GUESS I WAS JUST
RIDING THE WRONG HORSE.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.954
PROBABLY THE EXTRA WEIGHT
THAT KILLED HIM.

20:23.790 --> 20:24.857
GABRIEL!

20:24.891 --> 20:27.560
GABRIEL,
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING?

20:27.594 --> 20:28.861
UH, NO, ACTUALLY.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.463
THE, UH, GARBAGE
ON THIS SIDE OF THE STREET

20:30.497 --> 20:31.698
WAS PICKED UP YESTERDAY.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.533
SO, I SENT THE PATROL OFFICERS
TO THE DUMP,

20:33.566 --> 20:35.268
AND WHEN THEY GET BACK
WE CAN CHECK

20:35.302 --> 20:37.270
ACROSS THE STREET OVER THERE
AND SEE WHAT THEY FIND IN --

20:37.304 --> 20:39.806
OH, NO. NO.
NO WAITING.

20:39.839 --> 20:43.543
NOW, I AM NOT GOING TO STAY HERE
ANY LONGER THAN I HAVE TO.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.578
SO, YOU GET YOUR COVERALLS,
YOUNG MAN.

20:45.612 --> 20:46.713
YOU'RE GOING IN.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.317
ARE YOU GONNA HELP?

20:50.350 --> 20:52.018
I DON'T DUMPSTER.

20:57.056 --> 20:59.492
MA'AM, THIS WARRANT GIVES US
THE RIGHT TO SEARCH YOUR HOME,

20:59.526 --> 21:01.894
GARAGE, AUTOMOBILES, COMPUTERS,
AND E-MAIL ACCOUNTS.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.930
BUT IF YOU COULD
SIGN THIS CONSENT FORM,

21:03.963 --> 21:06.433
IT WOULD SHOW
YOUR COOPERATION.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.401
I NEED
TO TALK TO MY HUSBAND.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.337
HE'S NOT
ANSWERING HIS PHONE.

21:10.370 --> 21:14.040
HAVE YOU...FOUND SOME KIND
OF EVIDENCE THAT HE --

21:15.408 --> 21:16.709
I MEAN,
IS HE UNDER ARREST?

21:16.743 --> 21:19.312
MA'AM, WE JUST NEED
TO SEARCH THE HOUSE.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.714
HOPE YOU GUYS AREN'T TOO HOT.

21:23.916 --> 21:26.619
IF I FIND A BIG UMBRELLA IN
HERE, I'LL MAKE YOU SOME SHADE.

21:26.653 --> 21:29.021
HE HAD ME TO HIS HOUSE,
YOU KNOW -- DELK --

21:29.055 --> 21:31.358
RIGHT BEFORE HE DIED.

21:31.391 --> 21:34.827
"TRUST ME," HE SAYS.
"I GOT BIG PLANS FOR YOU."

21:34.861 --> 21:36.896
HEY, WAIT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. HEY.

21:36.929 --> 21:38.064
WHOA. HANG ON.
HANG ON.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.399
GABRIEL, GET DOWN HERE.

21:39.432 --> 21:42.034
GLADLY.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.836
HUH?

21:43.870 --> 21:46.939
NOW, THAT'S THE SAME KIND OF
LUGGAGE THAT THE DIXONS HAD,

21:46.973 --> 21:48.908
THE ONES
THEY TOOK TO HAWAII.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.577
YOU SURE?
YEAH, YEAH.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.346
MUST BE PART OF A SET.
OPEN THAT UP, DAVID.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.686
UNBELIEVABLE.

22:00.753 --> 22:03.456
GOOD CATCH, LIEUTENANT.
YEAH.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.591
GOOD CATCH.

22:06.493 --> 22:07.527
YEAH.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.436
OH.
IT'S PASSWORD-PROTECTED.

22:16.469 --> 22:19.939
LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET AHOLD
OF THE MANUFACTURER.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.408
SOMETIMES, IF YOU GIVE THEM
A SERIAL NUMBER,

22:21.441 --> 22:22.442
THEY CAN GIVE YOU
A WORKAROUND.

22:22.475 --> 22:23.843
EXCELLENT JOB, COMMANDER.

22:23.876 --> 22:26.446
CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU FOUND ANYTHING.

22:26.479 --> 22:29.416
WELL, NEVER BET AGAINST MY
YEARS OF EXPERIENCE, CAPTAIN.

22:29.449 --> 22:32.719
YEAH. WE COULDN'T
HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.621
A REGULAR NANCY DREW.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.723
Tao: ENGLISH.

22:36.756 --> 22:38.425
DID YOU FIND
PROFESSOR BANKS' FINGERPRINTS

22:38.458 --> 22:39.859
ON ANY OF THE ITEMS
THAT YOU RECOVERED?

22:39.892 --> 22:42.862
UH, NO. BUT WE'LL GET HIM.
DON'T YOU WORRY.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.397
TECH...SUPPORT!

22:44.431 --> 22:46.666
HEY, SO, I'M ENTERING
THE STUFF WE FOUND

22:46.699 --> 22:49.068
INTO THE STOLEN PROPERTY SYSTEM,
AND IT'S A FUNNY THING --

22:49.101 --> 22:51.538
THE DIXONS, THEY NEVER MENTION
A MISSING LAPTOP.

22:51.571 --> 22:52.839
REPRESENTATIVE.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.442
MAYBE THE COMPUTER
BELONGED TO ASHLEY REED

22:55.475 --> 22:56.809
AND THE PROFESSOR TOOK IT

22:56.843 --> 22:58.845
TO HIDE INCRIMINATING
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEM.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.847
REPRESENTATIVE.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.450
REPRESENTATIVE!

23:03.483 --> 23:05.452
OH, GEEZ.
I'M GONNA BE HERE ALL NIGHT.

23:05.485 --> 23:07.987
CHIEF, THE PROFESSOR'S WIFE
IS HERE TO SEE HIM.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.656
WE SET THEM UP
IN THE BREAK ROOM.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.624
I WIRED THE WALLS AND THE
CEILING TILES LIKE YOU ASKED.

23:11.658 --> 23:13.993
I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT
THEY'LL ALWAYS BE ON CAMERA,

23:14.026 --> 23:15.595
BUT THE SOUND
SHOULD BE FINE.

23:15.628 --> 23:16.763
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.565
LET'S SEE
WHAT THE, UH, LOVEBIRDS

23:18.598 --> 23:19.966
HAVE TO SAY TO EACH OTHER.

23:29.476 --> 23:32.111
HOW MANY MORE WERE THERE?

23:32.144 --> 23:35.848
JUST TELL ME, ALEX.

23:35.882 --> 23:37.984
HOW MANY OTHER STUDENTS
WERE YOU SCREWING?

23:38.017 --> 23:39.486
NONE, SARA.

23:39.519 --> 23:42.221
IT'S NOT TRUE.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.557
LET'S JUST
GET IT ALL OUT, OKAY?

23:44.591 --> 23:47.126
NOW THAT THINGS
ARE AS BAD AS THEY CAN BE.

23:47.159 --> 23:51.664
THE POLICE TORE APART
OUR HOUSE, ALEX,

23:51.698 --> 23:53.666
RIGHT IN FRONT
OF THE CHILDREN.

23:55.635 --> 23:58.170
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU DID
TO THAT POOR GIRL.

23:58.204 --> 24:01.674
YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE
I MURDERED HER.

24:01.708 --> 24:04.544
DO YOU SERIOUSLY THINK

24:04.577 --> 24:06.245
THAT I'M CAPABLE
OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

24:06.278 --> 24:08.715
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE CAPABLE
OF CHEATING ON ME, EITHER,

24:08.748 --> 24:10.850
AND I NEVER
IN A MILLION YEARS THOUGHT

24:10.883 --> 24:12.619
THAT YOU COULD LIE TO
MY FACE WHILE YOU WERE
DESTROYING OUR FAMILY!

24:12.652 --> 24:13.886
I PROMISED I WOULD NEVER

24:13.920 --> 24:15.888
DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT
TO YOU AGAIN.

24:15.922 --> 24:18.157
I'VE BEEN TAKING
OUR COUNSELING SERIOUSLY.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.026
I'M SPENDING MORE TIME
WITH THE KIDS.

24:20.059 --> 24:23.029
I AM TRYING SO HARD
TO REBUILD OUR TRUST.

24:23.062 --> 24:25.064
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S NOT WORKING.

24:31.303 --> 24:34.574
DID YOU MARRY ME
TO BECOME A CITIZEN?

24:34.607 --> 24:36.576
JUST TELL THE TRUTH, ALEX.

24:36.609 --> 24:39.011
WAS I A WAY OUT OF VISAS
AND GREEN CARDS?

24:39.045 --> 24:41.648
OH, LET'S NOT HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION AGAIN!

24:50.757 --> 24:53.660
I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE SO UPSET. I DO.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.697
BUT THIS IS IMPORTANT.

24:59.298 --> 25:02.001
IF YOU TALK
TO THE POLICE AGAIN,

25:02.034 --> 25:04.737
YOU NEED TO TELL THEM...

25:06.606 --> 25:09.241
...THAT I CAME STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER I DROPPED ASHLEY OFF

25:09.275 --> 25:14.313
AND THAT YOU WERE AWAKE
WHEN I GOT INTO BED.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.749
W WHY?

25:16.783 --> 25:19.518
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
I TOLD THEM.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.856
HERE WE GO.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.992
LET'S HOPE.

25:26.025 --> 25:29.896
YOU MEAN, YOU DIDN'T
COME STRAIGHT HOME?

25:32.098 --> 25:34.166
OH, MY GOD, ALEX.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.603
WHAT DID YOU DO?

25:36.636 --> 25:39.972
I, UH...

25:40.006 --> 25:44.110
I...DROVE AROUND
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.245
WHAT DID YOU DO, ALEX?

25:46.278 --> 25:47.880
I WAS TIRED,
AND -- AND I-I --

25:47.914 --> 25:50.016
NO!
JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH!

25:50.049 --> 25:53.219
WHAT DID YOU DO?!

25:53.252 --> 25:56.956
I DROVE BY
CHLOE'S HOUSE AGAIN.

25:56.989 --> 25:58.625
CHLOE

25:58.658 --> 26:01.327
THAT'S THE FORMER
STUDENT/MISTRESS.

26:01.360 --> 26:04.330
WHAT?

26:04.363 --> 26:06.666
SARA, LET ME
EXPLAIN WHY --

26:06.699 --> 26:09.001
YOU...YOU WENT
TO THAT WHORE'S HOUSE AGAIN?

26:09.035 --> 26:10.903
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

26:10.937 --> 26:13.105
WHILE I WAS PASSED OUT
FROM THE EXTRA WINE THAT
YOU PUT IN MY GLASS

26:13.139 --> 26:17.644
WHILE YOUR OWN CHILDREN
WERE SLEEPING IN THEIR BEDS...
DON'T USE THEM --

26:17.677 --> 26:19.245
...ON OUR ANNIVERSARY?!

26:19.278 --> 26:21.714
IT WAS --
IT WAS THE WRONG THING TO DO.

26:21.748 --> 26:23.315
I AM REALLY SORRY,

26:23.349 --> 26:26.185
AND I AM COMPLETELY ASHAMED
RIGHT NOW.
OH.

26:26.218 --> 26:29.622
BUT I DID NOT
GO IN TO HER HOUSE.
ASHAMED.

26:29.656 --> 26:30.890
WHAT ARE YOU --
I DID NOT
GET OUT OF THE CAR.

26:30.923 --> 26:33.626
I DID NOT
TALK TO HER EVEN!

26:33.660 --> 26:35.995
AND I CAME RIGHT HOME!
WHY ARE YOU EVEN
TELLING ME THIS?!

26:43.335 --> 26:45.805
BECAUSE I LIED TO THE POLICE,

26:45.838 --> 26:47.907
AND THEY MAY ASK YOU
WHERE I WAS...

26:49.241 --> 26:52.278
...SO IF STILL MEAN...

26:52.311 --> 26:56.248
ANYTHING TO YOU, SARA...

26:56.282 --> 26:59.819
LISTEN.

26:59.852 --> 27:03.690
KNOWING HOW THIS
WILL MAKE YOU FEEL,

27:03.723 --> 27:08.327
I WOULD NEVER TELL YOU
THAT I DROVE BY CHLOE'S HOUSE

27:08.360 --> 27:10.329
UNLESS IT WERE TRUE.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.666
HMM?

27:15.301 --> 27:16.669
IF YOU COULD JUST --

27:16.703 --> 27:18.938
DON'T...TOUCH ME.

27:28.781 --> 27:32.819
SARA...THIS IS MY LIFE...

27:32.852 --> 27:34.821
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

27:34.854 --> 27:37.289
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.025
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

27:40.827 --> 27:42.729
I THINK
YOU NEED A LAWYER.

27:44.463 --> 27:46.432
I THINK I NEED ONE, TOO.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.738
THAT'S ENOUGH
TO HOLD HIM OVERNIGHT.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.272
LIEUTENANT FLYNN,
WOULD YOU PLEASE

27:53.305 --> 27:55.374
EXTEND AN INVITATION
TO THE PROFESSOR, PLEASE?

27:55.407 --> 27:58.377
MM-HMM.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.991
Fritz: I TOLD YOU.
DIDN'T I TELL YOU?

28:12.024 --> 28:13.425
I TOLD YOU,
DO NOT TRUST POPE.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.427
LOOK, WILL IS IN A DIFFICULT
POSITION RIGHT NOW.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.129
DIFFICULT POSITION?
HE'S CHIEF.

28:17.163 --> 28:19.265
AND NOW THAT HE'S ON TOP,
HE'S GONNA FIGHT TO STAY THERE,

28:19.298 --> 28:21.000
EVEN IF THAT MEANS
THROWING YOU UNDER THE BUS.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.935
YOU KNOW, WILL
IS ON THIS LAWSUIT, TOO.

28:22.969 --> 28:24.336
IT'S RAYDOR.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.905
NOW SHE WANTS TO INTERVIEW
MY ENTIRE DIVISION.

28:25.938 --> 28:27.473
AH-HA!
WHAT "AH

28:27.506 --> 28:30.176
POPE SICCED RAYDOR ON YOU
SO YOU COULD TAKE ALL THE BLAME,

28:30.209 --> 28:32.311
AND HE GETS TO KEEP
HIS FOURTH STAR.
NO.

28:32.344 --> 28:34.781
YOUR FRIEND CHIEF DELK
SICCED RAYDOR ON ME.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.215
AND SHE'S STILL FOLLOWING YOU,
ISN'T SHE?

28:36.248 --> 28:38.751
BECAUSE POPE WANTS HER TO.

28:38.785 --> 28:41.020
HE IS A SURVIVOR, THAT GUY,
LIKE A -- LIKE A COCKROACH.

28:41.053 --> 28:44.090
LOOK, WHEN IT COMES TO WILL,
YOU ARE JUST IRRATIONAL.

28:44.123 --> 28:46.125
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE --
YOU'RE JUST TOO TRUSTING.

28:46.158 --> 28:48.795
I GUARANTEE YOU, IF YOU DON'T
LOOK OUT FOR YOURSELF,

28:48.828 --> 28:51.230
NO ONE ELSE IN THE L.A.P.D. --
AND I MEAN NO ONE --

28:51.263 --> 28:53.232
IS GONNA END UP
HAVING YOUR BACK.

28:53.265 --> 28:56.803
LIEUTENANT TAO,
YOU'RE STILL AT WORK?

28:56.836 --> 28:59.005
I'm sorry
to call so late, Chief.

28:59.038 --> 29:01.173
YOU KNOW THAT COMPUTER
WE FOUND IN THE DUMPSTER?

29:01.207 --> 29:03.009
I COULDN'T
GET PAST THE PASSWORD,

29:03.042 --> 29:04.310
AND THE COMPANY WAS NO HELP.

29:04.343 --> 29:05.778
I'M SORRY.

29:05.812 --> 29:07.179
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

29:07.213 --> 29:08.815
I JUST THINK IT'S SO GREAT
YOU STAYED SO LATE

29:08.848 --> 29:10.482
TO HELP ME WITH MY CASE.

29:10.516 --> 29:12.351
I KNEW YOU HAD MY BACK!

29:12.384 --> 29:15.321
HEY, TAO DOESN'T COUNT.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.089
OKAY.

29:17.123 --> 29:18.991
OH, BUT, CHIEF,
HERE'S SOME NEWS.

29:19.025 --> 29:21.260
I just got around to entering
the laptop into the S.P.S...

29:21.293 --> 29:22.995
THAT'S THE "STOLEN PROPERTY
SYSTEM."

29:23.029 --> 29:24.263
I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,
LIEUTENANT.

29:24.296 --> 29:26.065
WELL, I-IT TURNS OUT
IT WAS STOLEN.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.166
WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
IT WAS STOLEN.

29:27.199 --> 29:28.935
No, no, no, Chief.

29:28.968 --> 29:32.304
THE LAPTOP WAS PUT INTO
THE SYSTEM...FOUR MONTHS AGO.

29:32.338 --> 29:35.141
FOUR MONTHS AGO?

29:35.174 --> 29:37.910
THEN WHO OWNED IT
BEFORE LAST WEEK?

29:43.850 --> 29:46.252
WELL, I DON'T REMEMBER NEEDING
A PASSWORD TO ACCESS IT,

29:46.285 --> 29:48.220
BUT THIS IS MY OLD LAPTOP,
ALL RIGHT.

29:48.254 --> 29:50.356
AND WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

29:50.389 --> 29:54.927
THE, UH, "Q" IS STICKY,
AND IT'S ABOUT TO FALL OUT.

29:54.961 --> 29:56.963
AND THIS SCRATCH
ON THE TOP HERE,

29:56.996 --> 29:58.831
I HAD THE COMPUTER
ON THE SOFA,

29:58.865 --> 30:01.567
AND MY DOG JUMPED UP ON IT
AND DID THAT WITH HER NAILS.

30:03.035 --> 30:05.838
OH,
AND I BROUGHT MY RECEIPT.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.911
SEE THERE.
GERALD WEIN.

30:11.944 --> 30:13.512
UH-HUH.
THAT'S ME.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.082
DO YOU KNOW HOW THE BURGLARS
GAINED ENTRY INTO YOUR HOME?

30:16.115 --> 30:17.316
DON'T REALLY KNOW.

30:17.349 --> 30:19.551
SOMEHOW
THEY DISABLED THE ALARM.

30:19.585 --> 30:21.420
THERE WASN'T ANY SIGN
OF A BREAK-IN.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.222
AND WHERE WERE YOU,
MR. WEIN,

30:23.255 --> 30:25.224
DURING THE TIME
OF THE BURGLARY?

30:25.257 --> 30:27.626
I TOOK THE FAMILY SKIING
UP IN DODGE RIDGE.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.128
WE WERE GONE FOR A WEEK.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.097
WE CAME HOME TO FIND
THE FRONT DOOR OPEN

30:31.130 --> 30:32.932
AND THE HOUSE
COMPLETELY TRASHED.

30:32.965 --> 30:34.633
BUT IT WASN'T
AS BAD AS IT LOOKED.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.468
THEY DIDN'T
TOUCH THE ARTWORK,

30:36.502 --> 30:39.205
AND ASIDE FROM THE COMPUTER
AND SOME OF MY WIFE'S JEWELRY,

30:39.238 --> 30:40.572
NOT MUCH WAS STOLEN.

30:40.606 --> 30:43.042
IN FACT, THE DETECTIVE
WHO CAME TO THE HOUSE --

30:43.075 --> 30:45.177
HE SAID THE WHOLE THING
LOOKED AMATEUR.

30:45.211 --> 30:46.879
DID HE NOW?

30:48.247 --> 30:50.149
A-AND WHO KNEW Y'ALL
WERE GOING OUT OF TOWN?

30:50.182 --> 30:54.486
IT WASN'T A SECRET.
MY...ASSISTANT, I GUESS.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.556
MY WIFE'S SISTER
HAD OUR COMPLETE ITINERARY,

30:57.589 --> 31:00.392
AND MY SON POSTED IT
ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE.

31:00.426 --> 31:02.061
SO, BASICALLY, THE WORLD.

31:02.094 --> 31:04.363
TEENAGERS.

31:04.396 --> 31:07.399
YEAH. GOSH,
THEY GROW UP SO FAST.

31:07.433 --> 31:10.569
IT MAY HAVE BEEN OUR LAST
VACATION TOGETHER AS A FAMILY.

31:10.602 --> 31:12.671
DENNIS IS OFF TO COLLEGE
IN THE FALL.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.573
JUST GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL.

31:14.606 --> 31:17.143
JUST GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL?

31:17.176 --> 31:18.911
REALLY

31:18.945 --> 31:21.180
Flynn:
RIGHT THIS WAY, PLEASE.

31:24.016 --> 31:26.352
THANK Y'ALL SO MUCH
FOR COMING DOWN.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.020
ANYTHING
WE CAN DO TO HELP.

31:28.054 --> 31:30.222
WE'RE ALL JUST SO DEVASTATED
ABOUT ASHLEY.

31:30.256 --> 31:32.224
HAVE YOU SPOKEN
TO HER MOTHER YET?

31:32.258 --> 31:34.994
SHE WON'T TALK TO ME.

31:35.027 --> 31:36.395
DID YOU FIND
WHO DID THIS?

31:36.428 --> 31:38.464
UH, WE'VE MADE AN ARREST.
YES.

31:38.497 --> 31:39.999
OH, THANK GOD.
OH, WELL,
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

31:40.032 --> 31:41.367
WHO WAS IT?

31:41.400 --> 31:43.102
SOMEONE WITH A HISTORY
OF BAD BEHAVIOR...

31:44.336 --> 31:45.704
...BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO SAY
THAT WE RECOVERED

31:45.737 --> 31:47.506
MOST OF THE ITEMS
STOLEN FROM YOUR HOUSE.

31:47.539 --> 31:50.309
IT ALL SEEMS SO TRIVIAL
AT THIS POINT.

31:50.342 --> 31:53.345
WELL, IT'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL
IN CLOSING OUR CASE.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.681
OH, THERE'S MY WATCH.
Provenza: OH, SIR. SORRY.

31:55.714 --> 31:58.684
IF YOU DON'T MIND, WE HAVE A
SYSTEM HERE WE HAVE TO MANAGE.

31:58.717 --> 32:01.087
YEAH, MR. AND MRS. DIXON,
IN ORDER TO ENSURE

32:01.120 --> 32:03.289
ALL RECOVERED PROPERTY IS
RETURNED TO ITS RIGHTFUL OWNER,

32:03.322 --> 32:07.326
WE NEED A SIGNED DECLARATION
FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL ITEM.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.361
SO, IF YOU COULD JUST FILL OUT
THESE FORMS HERE IN TRIPLICATE

32:09.395 --> 32:12.464
AND DATE AND SIGN AT THE "X,"
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.666
YOU CAN SIT DOWN
RIGHT OVER HERE.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.036
THEN I HAVE TO INPUT EVERYTHING
INTO THE COMPUTER.

32:17.069 --> 32:19.171
WE CAN START WITH THE WATCH,
IF YOU LIKE, SIR.
OKAY. THANK YOU.

32:19.205 --> 32:21.207
Flynn: YOU WANT
TO PUT PUT THESE GLOVES ON?

32:21.240 --> 32:23.042
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
ANY FINGERPRINT DUST
ALL OVER YOUR HANDS.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.543
YEAH. AND, JESSE, WE HAVE
YOUR THINGS OVER HERE.

32:24.576 --> 32:26.478
MY THINGS?

32:26.512 --> 32:29.081
THE THIEF TOOK A SPECIAL
INTEREST IN YOUR ROOM.

32:29.115 --> 32:31.217
RIGHT THIS WAY.

32:37.189 --> 32:39.525
COME ON IN, JESSE.
HAVE A SEAT.

32:39.558 --> 32:41.527
YOU'RE OFF TO COLLEGE
NEXT YEAR, HUH?

32:41.560 --> 32:42.494
THAT'S EXCITING.

32:42.528 --> 32:44.463
YEAH, I GUESS.
HMM.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.598
THIS IS ONE FANCY PEN.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.700
LET ME GUESS --
GRADUATION PRESENT?

32:48.734 --> 32:50.702
YEAH.
I GOT A FEW OF THOSE.
UH-HUH.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.271
DON'T PEOPLE KNOW

32:52.304 --> 32:54.106
Y'ALL ONLY USE COMPUTERS
THESE DAYS?

32:54.140 --> 32:57.176
SPEAKING OF WHICH...

32:57.209 --> 32:58.710
FOUND YOUR LAPTOP.

32:58.744 --> 33:00.479
THANKS.
IF YOU COULD JUST,
UH, BOOT IT UP FOR US

33:00.512 --> 33:03.749
SO WE CAN LIST IT AS YOURS
AND WRAP THIS THING UP.

33:03.782 --> 33:06.218
YEAH. SURE. OKAY.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.322
ALL GOOD, THEN?

33:10.356 --> 33:11.657
IT'S YOURS?

33:11.690 --> 33:12.791
YEAH.
GREAT.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.360
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

33:14.393 --> 33:16.128
WHILE I WAS INVESTIGATING
ASHLEY'S MURDER,

33:16.162 --> 33:19.265
I FOUND A SERIES OF OTHER
BURGLARIES IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

33:19.298 --> 33:20.666
REALLY?

33:20.699 --> 33:21.800
IN FACT, I WAS JUST VISITING
WITH A MR. WEIN.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.569
NAME RING A BELL?

33:23.602 --> 33:26.705
HIS SON, DENNIS, WAS A SENIOR
IN HIGH SCHOOL WITH YOU.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.407
THEIR HOUSE WAS BURGLARIZED

33:28.440 --> 33:31.043
WHEN THEY WERE ON FAMILY
VACATION, JUST LIKE YOURS.

33:31.077 --> 33:34.280
YOU SEE, WE SPOKE TO A
MR. SIMMONS AND A MRS. PRESTON,

33:34.313 --> 33:35.781
AND THEY ALSO HAD BURGLARIES

33:35.814 --> 33:37.416
THAT OCCURRED
WHILE THEY WERE OUT OF TOWN.

33:37.449 --> 33:39.485
AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE
THEY ALSO HAVE KIDS

33:39.518 --> 33:41.353
WHO JUST GRADUATED
FROM YOUR HIGH SCHOOL.

33:41.387 --> 33:44.256
I DON'T REALLY RECOGNIZE
THOSE NAMES, SO, UM...

33:44.290 --> 33:46.658
REALLY? HMM.
THAT'S ODD.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.394
THEIR PARENTS
KNEW YOU REALLY WELL.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.496
SAID YOU AND THEIR KIDS
WERE THICK AS THIEVES.

33:50.529 --> 33:53.065
SO, TELL ME, JESSE,

33:53.099 --> 33:54.766
IF YOU REALLY
DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE,

33:54.800 --> 33:57.369
HOW IS IT THAT THIS COMPUTER,
WHICH YOU JUST SAID WAS YOURS,

33:57.403 --> 34:00.172
WHICH YOU SOMEHOW
FAILED TO REPORT AS STOLEN,

34:00.206 --> 34:02.841
WHICH HAS YOUR PASSWORD ON IT,
ENDED UP IN YOUR ROOM,

34:02.874 --> 34:07.213
WHEN WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT
IT WAS STOLEN FROM MR. WEIN?

34:07.246 --> 34:09.348
UM...WELL --

34:09.381 --> 34:10.449
COME ON, JESSE.

34:10.482 --> 34:11.717
IT'S CLEAR
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS

34:11.750 --> 34:13.252
WERE ROBBING
EACH OTHER'S HOUSES.

34:13.285 --> 34:16.288
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW
IS WHY.

34:16.322 --> 34:18.790
BEFORE YOU TELL ME...
DETECTIVE GABRIEL?

34:18.824 --> 34:21.260
JESSE DIXON, YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.

34:21.293 --> 34:22.528
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN
AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU

34:22.561 --> 34:23.762
IN A COURT OF LAW.

34:23.795 --> 34:25.397
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

34:25.431 --> 34:26.765
IF YOU CANNOT
AFFORD AN ATTORNEY,

34:26.798 --> 34:28.667
ONE WILL BE APPOINTED TO YOU
BY THE STATE.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.636
OR WE COULD BRING YOUR PARENTS
IN ON THIS, GET THEIR ADVICE.

34:30.669 --> 34:32.571
YOU WANT ME TO GO GET
YOUR MOM AND DAD?
NO, LOOK. NO, WAIT.

34:33.805 --> 34:35.774
IT ALL STARTED ON A DARE.

34:35.807 --> 34:38.277
LIKE, UM, YOU KNOW,
COULD WE REALLY PULL OFF

34:38.310 --> 34:40.212
BREAKING INTO
EACH OTHER'S HOUSES

34:40.246 --> 34:42.348
WITHOUT GETTING CAUGHT AND
TAKING SOME OF THE COOL STUFF

34:42.381 --> 34:43.782
OUR PARENTS WOULDN'T
CARE ABOUT SO MUCH

34:43.815 --> 34:45.484
OR THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES
WOULD REPLACE?

34:45.517 --> 34:46.518
THERE WAS NO SIGN
OF FORCED ENTRY

34:46.552 --> 34:47.886
AT ANY OF THESE HOUSES.

34:47.919 --> 34:49.688
OKAY, BECAUSE WE PUT EVERYTHING
INTO A PILE --

34:49.721 --> 34:51.390
HOUSE KEYS, ALARM CODES,
YOU KNOW,

34:51.423 --> 34:53.192
THE PASSWORDS THAT YOU USE
IF THE RENT-A-COPS COME AROUND.

34:53.225 --> 34:55.261
AND, LOOK.
OUR -- OUR PARENTS ARE RICH.

34:55.294 --> 34:56.562
HALF THE STUFF WE TOOK

34:56.595 --> 34:58.530
THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T EVEN
NOTICE WAS GONE.

34:58.564 --> 35:01.433
I-IT WAS JUST SOMETHING
WE DID DURING OUR SENIOR YEAR.

35:01.467 --> 35:02.768
IT WAS A JOKE.

35:02.801 --> 35:04.570
A JOKE?

35:06.872 --> 35:09.308
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
THAT MURDER IS SO FUNNY.

35:09.341 --> 35:11.877
NOW, WHO ALL WAS IN
THIS LITTLE GANG OF YOURS, HUH?

35:11.910 --> 35:15.347
I'VE GOT FINGERPRINTS
FROM ALL THESE ROBBERIES.

35:15.381 --> 35:17.216
ALL I NEED IS THE NAMES
TO GO WITH THEM.

35:22.521 --> 35:24.356
ALL RIGHT.

35:24.390 --> 35:26.592
UH, DETECTIVE GABRIEL, WOULD YOU
PLEASE MANAGE THE SUSPECT HERE

35:26.625 --> 35:28.794
WHILE I GO
AND INFORM THE PARENTS?

35:28.827 --> 35:30.896
JESSE DIXON, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE MURDER OF ASHLEY REED.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.331
STAND UP
AND PUT YOUR HANDS --
NO, YOU CAN'T --
YOU CAN'T ARREST ME.

35:32.364 --> 35:33.832
I WASN'T THERE.
I WASN'T THERE!

35:33.865 --> 35:35.167
IT DOESN'T MATTER
THAT YOU WEREN'T THERE.

35:35.201 --> 35:36.702
YOUR LITTLE SENIOR PRANK

35:36.735 --> 35:38.537
WAS ACTUALLY
A CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY,

35:38.570 --> 35:39.905
AND WHEN SOMEONE
GETS MURDERED

35:39.938 --> 35:41.673
DURING THE COMMISSION
OF THAT CRIME,

35:41.707 --> 35:43.175
IT'S FELONY MURDER.

35:43.209 --> 35:44.576
PLEASE,
THERE WAS NO CONSPIRACY.

35:44.610 --> 35:46.345
YOU JUST ADMITTED
YOU WERE PART OF A GANG.

35:46.378 --> 35:48.314
BUT I QUIT. I DID.
A LONG TIME AGO.
OH, COME ON.

35:48.347 --> 35:49.881
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
BELIEVE THAT?
IT'S THE TRUTH!

35:49.915 --> 35:51.883
OKAY, SO YOU QUIT,
BUT NOT BEFORE TELLING THEM

35:51.917 --> 35:53.752
YOU WERE GONNA BE
GOING OUT OF TOWN.
AND NOW ASHLEY IS DEAD.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.921
I SWEAR TO GOD, I HAD NO IDEA
THEY WERE GONNA HIT MY HOUSE.

35:55.954 --> 35:57.656
I WOULD'VE WARNED THEM
ASHLEY WAS THERE.

36:05.264 --> 36:06.932
I LOVED ASHLEY.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.602
OKAY, SO, WHO ARE THEY,

36:10.636 --> 36:13.405
THE REST OF YOUR
MERRY PRANKSTERS?

36:13.439 --> 36:16.308
I-I KNOW ABOUT DENNIS,
BUT WHO ELSE?

36:16.342 --> 36:19.678
PLEASE. YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO RUIN THE LIVES OF MY FRIENDS.

36:19.711 --> 36:22.314
YOU JUST SAID
YOU LOVED ASHLEY,

36:22.348 --> 36:24.883
AND HER LIFE LOOKS PRETTY RUINED
TO ME, DON'T YOU THINK?!

36:24.916 --> 36:26.585
THEY DIDN'T JUST
STEAL FROM YOUR PARENTS.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.354
DIDN'T YOU NOTICE?
THEY TOOK YOUR STUFF, TOO.

36:28.387 --> 36:29.855
DON'T YOU THINK
THEY WERE SENDING YOU

36:29.888 --> 36:31.390
A PRETTY SERIOUS MESSAGE?

36:31.423 --> 36:32.358
HAVE YOU SPOKEN
TO YOUR CO-CONSPIRATORS

36:32.391 --> 36:33.525
SINCE ASHLEY'S MURDER?

36:33.559 --> 36:34.660
WHAT DID THEY SAY?

36:34.693 --> 36:36.528
THAT THEY STOLE YOUR STUFF

36:36.562 --> 36:38.597
AND RAPED ASHLEY
TO GET BACK AT YOU?
NO, NO, NO, NO.

36:38.630 --> 36:39.931
THEY DID NOT RAPE ASHLEY!

36:39.965 --> 36:41.433
THE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
SHE WAS THERE, ALL RIGHT?

36:41.467 --> 36:43.935
ASHLEY -- THEY ALL SAID
ASHLEY SURPRISED THEM.

36:43.969 --> 36:45.604
SHE RAN OFF
TO CALL THE POLICE,

36:45.637 --> 36:47.239
AND THEY WERE JUST
TRYING TO STOP HER.

36:47.273 --> 36:48.674
THERE WAS NO RAPE!
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!

36:48.707 --> 36:50.742
I NEED
TO HEAR THAT FROM THEM.

36:50.776 --> 36:51.943
I WANT NAMES NOW!

36:54.012 --> 36:56.014
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT YOUR FRIENDS

36:56.047 --> 36:57.483
ARE GOING TO TRUST YOU
TO KEEP QUIET FOR THE
REST OF YOUR LIFE?

36:57.516 --> 36:58.784
THEY'RE NOT.

36:58.817 --> 37:02.254
YOU'RE A LOOSE END,
MY FRIEND.

37:02.288 --> 37:05.257
AND IN MY BUSINESS, LOOSE ENDS
DON'T FARE SO WELL.

37:07.759 --> 37:10.496
WHAT DO YOU THINK, JESSE?

37:15.934 --> 37:17.836
Flynn: OKAY,
SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT,

37:17.869 --> 37:20.038
THE, UH, SKU NUMBER
OR THE SERIAL NUMBER?
Tao: GIVE ME BOTH.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.308
OKAY.

37:22.341 --> 37:25.811
WE GOT BRAVO, ALPHA, SIX.

37:25.844 --> 37:29.515
BRAVO, ALPHA, SIX.

37:29.548 --> 37:32.050
FOUR, FOXTROT,
CHARLIE, ECHO.

37:32.083 --> 37:35.887
FOUR, FOXTROT,
CHARLIE, ECHO.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.657
HOW MUCH LONGER
IS THIS GONNA TAKE?

37:38.690 --> 37:41.393
OH, UM...

37:41.427 --> 37:43.562
NOT LONG.

37:47.333 --> 37:48.834
THANK YOU, JESSE.

37:48.867 --> 37:51.403
WE'LL ROUND UP THESE
LITTLE FRIENDS OF YOURS.

37:53.071 --> 37:54.706
I GUESS, UM...

37:54.740 --> 37:56.975
I GUESS I WON'T BE GOING TO
BERKELEY THIS FALL, WILL I?

37:57.008 --> 38:01.713
NO, BUT, UH, WE'LL FIND
SOME OTHER STATE INSTITUTION

38:01.747 --> 38:04.616
WITH A LIBRARY
IN IT FOR YOU.

38:12.758 --> 38:14.326
WILL YOU LET ME
TELL MY PARENTS?

38:15.727 --> 38:17.429
I'D RATHER
THEY HEAR IT FROM ME.

38:17.463 --> 38:18.964
SURE.

38:40.686 --> 38:43.121
Brenda: CAPTAIN.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.591
CHIEF JOHNSON.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.626
ONCE AGAIN,
YOU'VE MANAGED TO SEND

38:47.659 --> 38:50.596
YOUR ENTIRE SQUAD OF ELITE
DETECTIVES INTO THE FIELD,

38:50.629 --> 38:53.064
THIS TIME TO APPREHEND
A GROUP OF SUSPECTS

38:53.098 --> 38:55.901
THAT COULD HAVE EASILY
BEEN PICKED UP BY PATROL.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.069
MURDER SUSPECTS,
SEVEN OF THEM IN ALL.

38:58.103 --> 39:00.639
TEENAGERS. SO, LOTS OF PARENTS
TO DEAL WITH.

39:00.672 --> 39:04.543
LOOK,
WHETHER OR NOT YOU LIKE IT,

39:04.576 --> 39:06.778
WHETHER OR NOT I LIKE IT,
FRANKLY,

39:06.812 --> 39:08.747
I HAVE TO
FINISH THIS AUDIT,

39:08.780 --> 39:11.082
WHICH I MEANS I NEED
TO SPEAK TO YOUR PEOPLE.

39:15.954 --> 39:18.056
NO, YOU DON'T.

39:18.089 --> 39:21.092
YOU'RE QUESTIONING MY
INVESTIGATION AND MY ORDERS.

39:21.126 --> 39:24.095
THAT AUDIT SHOULD BEGIN
AND END WITH ME.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.398
BUT IT WON'T.

39:26.432 --> 39:28.667
EXCUSE ME.

39:35.674 --> 39:38.877
PROFESSOR BANKS, UH, WE HAVE
JUST FINISHED ARRESTING

39:38.910 --> 39:42.047
ALL THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE MURDER OF ASHLEY REED.

39:42.080 --> 39:47.018
YEAH, I HEARD ABOUT THAT,
A BURGLARY RING GONE AWRY.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.620
GOOD FOR YOU.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.090
OF COURSE,
THE REAL IRONY HERE IS,

39:52.123 --> 39:55.427
IF I HAD ACTUALLY BEEN
HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH ASHLEY,

39:55.461 --> 39:58.830
IF I WALKED HER TO THE DOOR
AND GONE INSIDE...

39:58.864 --> 40:00.699
SHE MIGHT STILL BE ALIVE.

40:02.200 --> 40:05.437
WELL, THAT'S THE BEST
JUSTIFICATION FOR ADULTERY

40:05.471 --> 40:06.972
I'VE HEARD IN A LONG TIME.

40:08.474 --> 40:11.810
ANYWAY, UM,
WE ARE OFFICIALLY SORRY

40:11.843 --> 40:14.513
ABOUT ANY MISUNDERSTANDING,
AND YOU'RE FREE TO GO HOME.

40:16.715 --> 40:17.949
THANKS.

40:19.551 --> 40:21.553
BUT IT'S BEEN MADE
QUITE CLEAR TO ME

40:21.587 --> 40:23.755
THAT I DON'T HAVE A HOME
TO GO TO ANYMORE.

40:27.726 --> 40:29.828
I'M...SORRY ABOUT THAT.

40:29.861 --> 40:31.196
I KNOW THIS ALL HAPPENED

40:31.229 --> 40:34.533
DURING A DIFFICULT TIME
IN YOUR MARRIAGE.

40:35.801 --> 40:38.003
I CERTAINLY KNOW
HOW HARD IT IS

40:38.036 --> 40:40.872
TO BE ACCUSED OF THINGS
YOU HAVEN'T DONE.

40:40.906 --> 40:43.642
YEAH.

40:43.675 --> 40:47.045
I'M NOT EXACTLY INNOCENT,
THOUGH, AM I?

40:47.078 --> 40:48.914
THAT'S THE TROUBLE.

40:55.253 --> 40:59.124
I CHEATED ON MY WIFE
AND MY FAMILY...

41:01.527 --> 41:03.128
...MORE THAN ONCE,
HONESTLY,

41:03.161 --> 41:07.599
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
I COULD GET AWAY WITH IT.

41:10.101 --> 41:13.805
BUT NOT EVERY MISTAKE
CAN BE FIXED WITH AN APOLOGY,

41:13.839 --> 41:15.774
NO MATTER
HOW SORRY YOU ARE.

41:15.807 --> 41:17.242
EXCUSE ME.
WELL, YOU'RE OWNING UP
TO WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

41:17.275 --> 41:18.544
THAT'S A START.

41:21.079 --> 41:22.213
AT WHAT?
