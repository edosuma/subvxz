00:00.148 --> 00:04.482
Someone is trying to kill Robin
Masters, and it is my job to stop them.

00:08.156 --> 00:10.056
Get away from me.
Go heel or somethin'.

00:11.092 --> 00:15.256
A good attack dog is silent and barks only after
his prey has been killed or rendered impotent.

00:15.330 --> 00:19.323
- Anybody who wants dogs that eat people, I don't
want nothing to do with. - She's dedicated.

00:21.636 --> 00:24.503
Higgins.

00:24.572 --> 00:26.563
- He's been drugged.
- I'll carry him.

01:55.065 --> 01:58.831
It was the Paris of Hemingway
and Fitzgerald that Mark sought,

01:58.902 --> 02:01.462
even though he knew
it only existed on celluloid...

02:01.538 --> 02:04.371
and in the yellowing pages
of books.

02:04.441 --> 02:08.969
A Paris of absinthe and rainy
afternoons and warm women.

02:09.044 --> 02:11.309
He concentrated on those images
when the pain...

02:11.381 --> 02:14.646
- Monsieur.
- Good Lord.! Rene, stop.

02:14.718 --> 02:17.050
No.

02:25.095 --> 02:27.063
Sorry, Rene.
You were quite right.

02:27.130 --> 02:29.655
Merci, Robin.

02:30.867 --> 02:33.563
Damn. Really blew it this time.

02:34.971 --> 02:37.496
If anyone's to blame, it's me.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.508
Isn't it?

02:41.644 --> 02:45.478
One could say that.
Now what happens?

02:45.548 --> 02:48.483
Now Robin runs to wherever
he's hidden the tapes.

02:50.320 --> 02:54.017
The apartment in Manhattan,
the villa in Andros,

02:54.090 --> 02:57.457
the chalet at Innsbruck,
the estate in Hawaii.

02:57.527 --> 02:59.825
We'll have to cover all his homes.

03:01.064 --> 03:03.089
What do you think?

03:06.102 --> 03:10.630
Jogging may be a fading fad on the mainland,
but in Hawaii it's a way of life.

03:10.707 --> 03:14.108
Everyone runs here,
no matter what other sport they're into.

03:14.177 --> 03:17.476
I surf ski,
play sand volleyball and swim.

03:17.547 --> 03:20.448
But I also run on the beach
in the mornings.

03:22.352 --> 03:24.411
I find it... stimulating.

03:24.487 --> 03:26.455
Hi.

03:31.327 --> 03:35.229
Of course, when... you surf ski,
play sand volleyball and swim,

03:35.298 --> 03:38.392
you shouldn't
overexert yourself running.

03:39.502 --> 03:41.436
Thanks, Moana.

03:41.504 --> 03:45.133
Can I have a beer, Moana? You're never
gonna stay in shape drinking beer, Thomas.

03:45.208 --> 03:49.076
Look who's talking. The only exercise you get
is walking between the bar and the dining room.

03:49.145 --> 03:54.276
You don't have to exercise to stay in shape. All you have
to do is get a lot of rest and drink a lot of fruit juice.

03:54.350 --> 03:58.286
That sounds like a cure for the flu.
Mmm. I'm serious.

03:58.354 --> 04:01.790
I've been reading Fitness through Fruit
Juices, written by a Dr. Harlan Levy.

04:01.858 --> 04:05.294
He says that if you drink the proper
blend of fruit juices six times a day,

04:05.361 --> 04:07.420
you don't have to diet
or exercise or anything.

04:07.497 --> 04:10.489
What's so funny? You think I'm kidding?
Listen. Take this, for example.

04:10.567 --> 04:13.161
This is Dr. Levy's blend
of pineapple, orange, papaya,

04:13.236 --> 04:16.262
loquat, kumquat, boysenberry,
blueberry, cherry.

04:16.339 --> 04:20.742
One glass of this will make you healthier than
if you were to run seven miles in the morning.

04:20.810 --> 04:24.075
That one glass? That one glass.

04:26.883 --> 04:29.351
You forgot to mention the vodka.

04:29.419 --> 04:32.149
I added that for flavoring.

04:33.990 --> 04:35.981
Nice race. Pardon me?

04:36.059 --> 04:39.085
Oh, on the beach before.
You really pulled away from me.

04:39.162 --> 04:41.289
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr...

04:41.364 --> 04:44.356
Magnum. Thomas Magnum.

04:44.434 --> 04:47.403
Really? Uh, well,
as I said before, I'm...

04:47.470 --> 04:49.438
I'm sorry,
I didn't know we were racing.

04:49.506 --> 04:51.497
- See you later.
- Bye.

04:53.376 --> 04:56.504
Her name's Joy Doyle,
and she's nobody's guest.

04:56.579 --> 05:00.242
She's a member of the Malibu Surf Club,
who we have reciprocating privileges with.

05:00.316 --> 05:02.944
And, um, I understand she's single.

05:03.019 --> 05:05.988
She's an archaeologist
or, uh, anthropologist...

05:06.055 --> 05:08.285
or one of those
bone-diggin'ologist people.

05:08.358 --> 05:13.523
But you know somethin', Thomas? In the last 36 hours,
nobody's been able to melt the ice any better than you.

05:13.596 --> 05:16.724
I wasn't trying to melt any ice, Rick.
That's good.

05:16.799 --> 05:18.892
Because you didn't.

05:23.473 --> 05:28.172
She might outrun me on the beach,
but she couldn't beat me on a surf ski.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.804
Part of me wanted to
go down there and prove it, but...

05:30.880 --> 05:33.508
I realized that
would have been childish.

05:42.992 --> 05:44.857
Hi, again.

05:46.930 --> 05:49.763
I know. We're not racing.

05:54.771 --> 05:58.673
Well, you may not be racing,
but me, I'm racing.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.513
I just don't know if I can
keep up this pace much longer.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.578
Wanna call it a tie?

06:14.424 --> 06:16.415
Tie.

06:19.762 --> 06:23.289
Joy Doyle.
But people I race against call me Digger.

06:23.366 --> 06:26.028
- Nice to meet you, Digger.
- Same here,

06:26.102 --> 06:29.697
Magnum, if that really is your name.

06:31.841 --> 06:35.106
I wouldn't toss rocks.
Not with a name like Digger.

06:35.178 --> 06:38.670
Well, it's only a nickname.
Yours is for real.

06:38.748 --> 06:41.216
You had a choice. I didn't.

06:41.284 --> 06:44.685
Oh, with a doctorate in archaeology,
what choice do you think I had?

06:44.754 --> 06:47.245
I don't know.
They could have called you Bones.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.723
Got me.

06:54.897 --> 06:58.355
Is this your car? What do you mean?
Doesn't it look like my car?

07:00.136 --> 07:03.572
Well, no it... looks like my car.
Your car?

07:03.640 --> 07:06.609
Fooled me too. I thought this
was Robin's car for sure.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.975
Thank you. Robin's.
I knew your name wasn't Magnum.

07:10.046 --> 07:12.014
Yes, it is. It's just that...

07:12.081 --> 07:16.211
my car sort of technically
belongs to Robin Masters.

07:16.285 --> 07:18.310
Robin Masters, the novelist?

07:18.388 --> 07:21.084
Do you know him?
Well, we're sort of neighbors.

07:21.157 --> 07:24.354
You live next door to him?
Oh, well, not actually next door.

07:24.427 --> 07:28.864
Um, I kind of live on his estate, which is where
we're going if you ever put the car into first.

07:31.034 --> 07:34.492
I've read all of his novels,
including the latest one, The Golden Spike.

07:34.570 --> 07:36.731
Did you read that?
Oh, but of course you did.

07:36.806 --> 07:39.707
You probably read the first draft
hot out of the typewriter.

07:39.776 --> 07:42.472
Robin Masters doesn't use a typewriter.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.139
He dictates all his novels
into a tape recorder.

07:45.214 --> 07:47.478
Well, however he does it,
he's very good.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.383
It's so mysterious the way
he travels all over the world,

07:50.453 --> 07:53.115
never stopping in one place
long enough to have three meals.

07:54.457 --> 07:57.984
Well, considering Robin's waistline,
that's a bit of an exaggeration.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.895
And all those lurid parties.

08:01.964 --> 08:06.230
Listen to me tell you.
You've probably been to most of them.

08:06.302 --> 08:08.930
Oh, just the ones in Hawaii.

08:10.039 --> 08:14.499
Is it true that the bedrooms
in his house are,

08:14.577 --> 08:18.980
you know, sort of...
mirrored and things like that?

08:20.049 --> 08:22.074
And that his is extra special?

08:25.021 --> 08:27.581
Well, I don't know
about Robin's bedroom.

08:27.657 --> 08:32.594
But I do know that mine is
a relatively normal bedroom.

08:32.662 --> 08:34.653
Do you think I could see it?

08:34.731 --> 08:37.756
- My bedroom?
- No, Robin's.

08:44.841 --> 08:49.437
I'll need a decision within the next 10
minutes if I'm to get proper clearance.

08:49.512 --> 08:51.503
Yes, I understand.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.582
The laser beam cut through
the night like the Singing Sword,

08:57.653 --> 09:00.554
lighting the black
with Merlin-like pyrotechnics.

09:00.623 --> 09:05.356
It was at that precise moment that Mark
realized Madonna had tried to kill him.

09:05.428 --> 09:07.453
Yes, Rene, what is it?

09:07.530 --> 09:11.398
Um, we need a destination,
Robin, other than west.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.458
Yes, I have it right here.

09:19.509 --> 09:21.670
Very good.

09:21.744 --> 09:23.769
And get me Hawaii, Luana.

09:26.249 --> 09:28.444
It was absurd,
but all Mark could think was...

09:28.518 --> 09:31.715
that the sound of the laser
shattering the window was,

09:31.788 --> 09:34.655
uh, precisely like the...

09:34.724 --> 09:36.988
tinkle of ice against crystal.

09:57.647 --> 10:00.445
Open up, Higgins.

10:02.485 --> 10:04.817
Yes, Mr. Masters. I quite understand.

10:04.887 --> 10:06.855
Open up, Higgins.

10:06.923 --> 10:09.858
You can rely on me to take every
precaution should you decide to come here.

10:09.926 --> 10:13.191
Higgins, what do I have to swap
to get in here?

10:37.920 --> 10:40.718
I assure you, sir.
Security is impenetrable.

10:43.359 --> 10:45.589
With one exception.

10:46.796 --> 10:50.823
Yes, Mr. Masters.
I look forward to it too.

10:51.934 --> 10:54.402
Hi, Higgins.

10:59.475 --> 11:02.706
I was wondering if you could show
a friend of mine Robin's bedroom.

11:02.778 --> 11:04.871
What?

11:04.947 --> 11:09.884
Uh, just be a minute. Look, she's a bit
starstruck, and she gave me a ride home,

11:09.952 --> 11:12.250
and I promised her
she could see Robin's bedroom.

11:12.321 --> 11:16.485
She's got this crazy idea... Magnum, I don't have
time for this. That was Robin Masters on the phone.

11:16.559 --> 11:18.857
What, just now? Yes.

11:19.996 --> 11:23.727
Higgins, you should've told me.
Digger would've gone nuts to talk to Robin.

11:23.799 --> 11:25.562
Digger?

11:25.635 --> 11:29.435
Well, that's just a nickname. Digger, why
don't you come in here and say hi to Higgins?

11:29.505 --> 11:33.999
Magnum, really, I haven't got time to talk to
starstruck women. What can it hurt to say hello?

11:34.372 --> 11:36.306
Hello, Higgins.

11:48.440 --> 11:52.035
You better know how to use that, lady.
I can drive a tack at 50 feet.

11:52.078 --> 11:54.012
I'm not a tack.
Or belly buttons.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.105
But I'd, uh,
rather just use the phone.

11:56.182 --> 11:58.616
Uh, that's not a normal telephone.

11:58.685 --> 12:00.949
I know.

12:03.256 --> 12:06.714
Mr. Masters? This is J. Doyle,

12:06.793 --> 12:08.761
special agent with Starguard.

12:08.828 --> 12:10.762
Yes, sir.

12:10.830 --> 12:15.358
I'm in the den. I have a Mr. Higgins and
a Mr. Magnum slightly inconvenienced.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.699
Yes, sir.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.996
Thank you, sir.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.975
Robin Masters
would like to talk to you.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.540
Yes, Mr. Masters.

12:31.617 --> 12:33.209
Yes.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.386
Yes, I quite understand.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.359
It seems Miss Doyle is with Starguard,

12:44.430 --> 12:46.864
a security firm
that specializes in protecting...

12:46.933 --> 12:50.596
corporate V.I.P.s,
the wealthy, the famous.

12:50.670 --> 12:54.197
Mr. Masters engaged them
when he received a threat on his life...

12:54.273 --> 12:56.707
if he published a novel
he's working on.

12:57.710 --> 13:00.235
Evidently the threat was
quite legitimate.

13:00.313 --> 13:04.113
An attempt was made to kidnap or kill him
48 hours ago in the south of France.

13:04.183 --> 13:06.378
He's okay? Yes, quite.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.649
He's flying now to pick up all the tapes
he dictated for this new novel,

13:09.722 --> 13:12.054
which are stored on one of his estates.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.992
For security reasons,
Starguard recommends that...

13:15.061 --> 13:17.757
he not reveal which estate
until the last possible moment.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.824
Once the tapes are in the hands
of Robin's publisher,

13:21.901 --> 13:25.928
Starguard feels that... he'll
be quite safe. Why the games?

13:26.005 --> 13:29.873
Why the hell didn't you just come in
here and tell Higgins who you were?

13:29.942 --> 13:33.275
Starguard felt
that security here was not...

13:33.346 --> 13:37.942
up to its standards, despite Mr.
Masters's assurances that it was.

13:38.017 --> 13:40.485
So they sent Miss Doyle in
to prove their point.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.953
Which she did quite ably.

13:44.023 --> 13:46.548
She's in charge now, and I'll be...

13:46.626 --> 13:48.617
taking my orders from her.

13:48.694 --> 13:50.491
Thank you. For what?

13:50.563 --> 13:52.622
Trying to make a fool out of a man...

13:52.698 --> 13:55.428
who'd never let you in the front gate
if it hadn't been for me.

13:55.501 --> 13:59.494
- The point is that I got through the front
gate. Not how. - That's not the point at all!

13:59.572 --> 14:01.540
Yes, it is. She's quite right.

14:01.607 --> 14:05.737
It doesn't matter how she got in, just
that she did get in... and with a weapon.

14:05.812 --> 14:09.111
If she wanted to kill Robin,
all she'd have to do is... wait.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.810
- Precisely.
- Why are you arguing for her?

14:11.884 --> 14:14.352
Magnum, I'm not upset with you. Really.

14:15.421 --> 14:17.946
It's my fault.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.958
Let's just leave it at that.

14:20.960 --> 14:24.293
I assume you'll want an immediate
tour of the grounds, Miss Doyle.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.354
Please.

14:29.502 --> 14:32.471
I wished Higgins would have
yelled or screamed...

14:32.538 --> 14:36.406
or jumped up and down and turned red or
something... anything but be understanding.

14:36.475 --> 14:39.672
I couldn't stand it when Higgins was
understanding. It made me feel guilty.

14:39.745 --> 14:41.713
Maybe if the dogs bit me.

14:41.781 --> 14:43.806
How very clever.

14:45.017 --> 14:48.976
It did serve well to keep our
conversation going where I wanted it.

14:50.990 --> 14:53.686
Knowing Magnum, that shouldn't
have been too difficult.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.685
You are furious with him.

14:56.762 --> 14:58.696
I am always furious with Magnum.

14:58.764 --> 15:01.062
But at the moment,
I feel no more fury than usual.

15:01.133 --> 15:04.398
So, you see,
I'm not really furious with him.

15:04.470 --> 15:08.236
Although I have every right to be, since
he was incredibly stupid and gullible.

15:09.842 --> 15:12.777
Shall we take the truck?
Whatever you suggest.

15:16.382 --> 15:18.373
Thank you.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.353
We have over 200 acres here,

15:29.428 --> 15:31.521
extending from mauka to makai.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.657
That's Hawaiian for
from the mountains to the sea.

15:34.734 --> 15:38.500
Of course, only the five-acre main
compound is wired against intruders.

15:38.571 --> 15:41.938
Anything beyond that?
This isn't a military outpost.

15:42.008 --> 15:44.135
It may have to be.

16:05.765 --> 16:09.064
That's it, Higgy baby.
I have had it with these mangy pot hounds.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.069
Zeus, Apollo, patrol.

16:11.137 --> 16:14.231
Go heel or somethin; Patrol!

16:16.309 --> 16:20.211
Chasin' me all over this plantation
every time I come to see T.M.

16:20.279 --> 16:22.577
They barked. Yeah, you noticed.

16:22.648 --> 16:27.176
A good attack dog is silent and barks only after
his prey has been killed or rendered impotent.

16:28.187 --> 16:31.122
- Killed? Impote...
- How did you get in?

16:35.294 --> 16:38.422
The same way we always do when the
gate's locked. Over the fence.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.955
Impossible. You would have set off
the alarm the way you always do.

16:50.376 --> 16:52.367
It's over here.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.839
It's a neutralizer to bypass
the fence alarm.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.976
See, all I gotta do is...

17:01.687 --> 17:05.281
Must be getting a little rusty.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.291
Covered with corrosion is more like it.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.352
This alarm system is out of date.

17:10.429 --> 17:14.798
- A child could bypass it. - This system is
less than two years old. I installed it myself.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.993
Using designs that are 10 years old.

17:17.069 --> 17:22.029
Compared to the new sonic alarms, this system
is as antiquated as a World War II... soldier.

17:25.344 --> 17:29.144
If you'll excuse me for a few minutes,
Miss Doyle, I have the lads to feed.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.581
Then we can resume your tour.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.320
Uh, yeah, me too.
Hold it, Higgy baby.

17:38.224 --> 17:41.125
You are really something, Miss Doyle.

17:41.193 --> 17:43.787
Why? Because I take my work so seriously?

17:43.863 --> 17:46.388
No. Because if I make a mistake,
my client may be killed.

17:46.465 --> 17:49.229
It's the pleasure you take
out of making other people look foolish.

17:50.503 --> 17:54.303
- There's no pleasure in it.
- Then why do you do it with such relish?

17:54.373 --> 17:57.638
You know, that little man has done
a damn good job of securing this estate.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.873
Especially when you consider the guests that
Robin Masters has paraded through here.

18:00.946 --> 18:04.814
Now, this is a rich man's estate.
It's not an outpost in 'Nam.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.011
Or at least it wasn't
supposed to be until today.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.350
So I don't think Higgins
should be held responsible...

18:09.422 --> 18:11.515
for not securing it for World War III.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.918
Thomas, wait a minute, please.

18:14.994 --> 18:16.928
Look, I can use your help.

18:16.996 --> 18:19.021
Oh, lady, you have got to be kidding.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.760
I'm not. I can't help it
if I'm a perfectionist.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.997
It's what makes me so damn good at
what I do. What, conning people?

18:25.071 --> 18:28.598
Look who's talking. You live here in
luxury, you drive an expensive sports car,

18:28.674 --> 18:32.303
you haven't had over $200 in your
checking account since you left the navy.

18:32.378 --> 18:34.505
Boy, you really dug deep.
Part of the job.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.743
I know all about you. Your background.
All of it.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.751
Naval Intelligence, 'Nam,

18:39.819 --> 18:42.879
your relationship with Rick,
T.C... even Higgins.

18:42.955 --> 18:46.391
Well, that never was much,
and you haven't helped any.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.553
But I can. Look, I'm only here
until Robin gets his tapes...

18:49.628 --> 18:51.562
if he comes here at all.

18:51.630 --> 18:55.532
And, well, when I leave I can recommend
that Higgins gets put back in charge.

18:55.601 --> 18:57.535
In exchange for...

18:57.603 --> 18:59.036
You, T.C. and Rick.

19:00.739 --> 19:05.176
I don't have time to interview security people on the
island, and I'm not gonna fly them in from the mainland.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.542
I thought Starguard
was some big operation.

19:07.613 --> 19:10.411
It is, but reliable helicopter pilots
aren't a dime a dozen.

19:10.483 --> 19:14.283
Or weapons specialists like Rick, or a
counterinsurgent expert like yourself.

19:14.353 --> 19:17.220
You happen to be the best,
and I need you.

19:17.289 --> 19:19.655
Or, rather, Robin does.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.317
Well?

19:23.395 --> 19:25.522
What do you say?

19:25.598 --> 19:27.532
No. N-O. No.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.761
Why not? Why... Why not?

19:29.835 --> 19:32.360
Man, that chick is crazy.
She wants dogs that eat people.

19:32.438 --> 19:36.465
- Anybody who wants dogs that eat people, I don't
want nothin' to do with. - She's dedicated.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.533
That's exactly why
I don't wanna get involved.

19:38.611 --> 19:42.274
- 'Cause I know what's gonna happen. I'm gonna
wind up gettin' shot at. - No, you're not.

19:42.348 --> 19:45.875
T.C., I said, no, you're not.

19:45.951 --> 19:49.443
I heard what you said.
And you want me to say, "" You wanna bet?"

19:49.522 --> 19:53.151
And then I bet you 'cause I see easy
money, and then I end up gettin' shot at.

19:53.225 --> 19:56.752
- That's not what I'm tryin' to do at all.
- You wanna bet?

20:00.933 --> 20:03.401
All right, T.M.

20:03.469 --> 20:06.597
The bottom line is I got hired by
this old dude and his young wife...

20:06.672 --> 20:08.640
to take them on a seven-day tour.

20:08.707 --> 20:11.073
And for this one,
I get paid the big one per day.

20:12.511 --> 20:16.413
A hundred bucks? That's not the
big one, T.M., and you know it.

20:16.482 --> 20:20.782
I'm gettin' paid 7,000 bucks
for seven days.

20:20.853 --> 20:25.984
And the wife said if I take her to some interesting spots,
there's gonna be a bonus in it for me. Can you beat that?

20:26.058 --> 20:28.686
No. But Starguard will.

20:28.761 --> 20:32.094
Ha! Good-bye, T.M.

20:59.191 --> 21:01.853
Are you all right?

21:03.128 --> 21:06.495
I will be as soon as I get
my stomach back together again.

21:07.933 --> 21:11.334
Not used to flying.
Oh, no. I'm a check pilot with the F.A.A.

21:11.403 --> 21:14.065
In 10 years, I have never flown
with anybody so incompetent.

21:14.139 --> 21:18.166
How he got his license in the first place,
I will never know, but I'll tell you this.

21:18.244 --> 21:21.407
When I file my report, I'm sure the
agency will ground him immediately.

21:21.480 --> 21:24.677
They have to,
before he kills someone.

21:24.750 --> 21:28.516
Who are you talking about? I'm sorry. I can't
divulge that. It's against regulations.

21:28.587 --> 21:31.078
Thanks for the ride.

21:41.133 --> 21:45.035
Hey, wait! Wait! Hey!

21:50.442 --> 21:54.344
I want a Hitchcock stun fence installed
around the main house by tonight,

21:54.413 --> 21:59.282
half a dozen sonic alerts randomly placed along
the most likely approaches to the compound.

22:00.653 --> 22:04.453
But my main concern
is this 200-meter stretch of beach.

22:04.523 --> 22:06.388
Practically indefensible.

22:06.458 --> 22:11.293
Oh, no problem. We just dig in and plant
claymore mines here, here, here and here.

22:11.363 --> 22:14.025
Yeah, maybe I can rig my chopper
with some Gatling guns...

22:14.099 --> 22:17.899
and lay down some suppressing gunfire when
those bad guys try to land their rubber boats.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.131
Guys, this is not a joking matter.

22:20.205 --> 22:24.505
Someone is trying to kill Robin Masters.

22:24.576 --> 22:28.012
They obviously have
a great deal of money and power.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.982
They'll be coming by land, sea or air,
and it is my job to stop them.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.951
I thought it was our job.

22:34.019 --> 22:37.147
Our job. Higgins,
can you handle the fence...

22:37.222 --> 22:39.156
and the alarms?

22:39.224 --> 22:42.489
Miss Doyle, I'm not familiar with the
Hitchcock stun fence or sonic alerts,

22:42.561 --> 22:46.088
but I assure you I am quite quick and
should have no difficulty installing them.

22:46.165 --> 22:49.430
Just make sure he has
step-by-step instructions.

22:49.501 --> 22:52.163
T.C., you'll fly Robin directly here
from the airport.

22:52.237 --> 22:55.263
Me?

22:55.341 --> 22:58.071
- Just tell me when.
- I won't know his arrival time...

22:58.143 --> 23:00.976
until his jet is
less than a hundred miles out.

23:01.046 --> 23:02.980
In fact, he may not show up at all.

23:03.048 --> 23:06.017
No one except Robin Masters knows
to which estate he'll be flying.

23:06.085 --> 23:10.283
Well, someone sure thinks it's Hawaii. That alarm
neutralizer on the fence didn't just grow there.

23:10.356 --> 23:12.824
I told you.
The opposition is powerful.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.825
They're covering all their bets.

23:14.893 --> 23:17.953
We'll need a full-time guard
at the front gate from here on out. Rick.

23:18.030 --> 23:22.330
Guard duty. I knew it. Even in the Corps,
that's all I ever pulled was guard duty.

23:23.736 --> 23:27.001
- You'll find an M16 in the trunk of my car.
- Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.199
Lady, please.
Leave the weapons to me, okay?

23:29.274 --> 23:33.938
Okay. Higgins, you can pick up the stun fence
and the alarms at the airport in an hour.

23:34.012 --> 23:36.207
Flight number four
from Los Angeles.

23:36.281 --> 23:40.547
You all have your assignments.
We'll meet again at 1800 hours.

23:40.619 --> 23:42.849
Is that 6:00?
I haven't the slightest idea.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.855
Is that daytime or nighttime?
Subtract 12.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.857
Subtract 12 from what?
Eighteen.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.916
Oh.

23:51.096 --> 23:53.826
Aren't you forgetting something?

23:53.899 --> 23:57.460
What?
My little role here at the Alamo.

23:57.536 --> 24:00.403
No, I haven't forgotten anything.

24:00.472 --> 24:02.906
It's your job to find the holes
in my defense.

24:02.975 --> 24:05.273
The overlooked, the obvious.

24:05.344 --> 24:07.972
Ah, you're admitting you can
make mistakes. Of course.

24:08.046 --> 24:11.311
But I won't, because I'm aware
of the fact that I can...

24:11.383 --> 24:13.374
and take steps
to assure that I don't.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.060
What are you doing?

24:28.567 --> 24:31.968
Yes? Uh, Robin Masters, please.
Thomas Magnum, Hawaii, calling.

24:32.971 --> 24:36.463
Uh, Mr. Masters is, uh,
indisposed at the moment.

24:36.542 --> 24:40.410
May I take a message, please?
Uh, I am Mr. Masters's personal secretary.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.470
You mean his bodyguard.

24:42.548 --> 24:45.244
Are you with Starguard?
Uh, yes, I am.

24:45.317 --> 24:48.684
Would you describe the agent
that your company sent to Hawaii...

24:48.754 --> 24:50.745
to secure Robin's estate?

24:50.823 --> 24:52.757
Of course.

24:52.825 --> 24:57.091
Well, her name is Joy Doyle,
but, um, everyone calls her Digger.

24:57.162 --> 25:00.393
She's, um, 5 foot 7, dark hair,

25:00.466 --> 25:02.525
quite attractive for an American.

25:02.601 --> 25:06.731
She has a barbell birthmark
on her lower right buttock.

25:06.805 --> 25:09.501
Ask her to show it to you.

25:09.575 --> 25:13.306
She's also as cold as the berg
that sank the Titanic.

25:13.378 --> 25:16.677
Thank you.
I've seen the birthmark.

25:18.684 --> 25:21.209
That's what I mean.
Look for the obvious.

25:21.286 --> 25:23.311
Very good.

25:23.388 --> 25:29.156
Although you could have told him that you saw my
birthmark while I was running or surf-skiing.

25:29.228 --> 25:33.358
Oh, I'm sorry. What I meant was I
didn't need it to identify you.

25:33.432 --> 25:36.492
His description of cold as
an iceberg was sufficient.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.026
Confidential letter to Mr. Robin Masters...

26:03.395 --> 26:06.990
from Jonathan Quayle Higgins III.

26:07.065 --> 26:09.829
Resignation.

26:15.908 --> 26:19.639
What's the password? How very original.
Open the gate, please.

26:19.711 --> 26:24.512
Gee, Higgins. I'm just trying to cheer you up a little
bit. Don't. It would ruin a wonderful depression.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.575
I'll open the gate.
That would be nice.

26:41.133 --> 26:44.125
Perhaps I have reached the age...

26:44.202 --> 26:47.968
when my experience...
and techniques...

26:48.040 --> 26:52.477
have been outdated by recent
technological advancements in the field.

26:52.544 --> 26:56.537
I assure you.
My decision in no way affects...

26:56.615 --> 26:58.640
Look out.!

27:11.163 --> 27:13.154
Hello, there.

27:19.304 --> 27:23.206
He tried to remember that
she had sold the laser chips to Vladimir...

27:23.275 --> 27:25.869
and because of that he could die.

27:25.944 --> 27:28.174
But he couldn't resist her.

27:28.246 --> 27:33.274
The soft silk of her gown
clinging suggestively to her body...

27:33.352 --> 27:36.150
seemed to Mark like, uh...

27:36.221 --> 27:39.281
Like the label on a bottle
of Lafite-Rothschild,

27:39.358 --> 27:42.350
which can only hint
at the pleasures that lay within.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.241
He bought
a one-way ticket to London,

27:57.309 --> 28:00.403
gave me this note to deliver to Robin
Masters and the keys to the car.

28:00.479 --> 28:04.916
Damn it, I know Higgins. He wouldn't
resign. At least until Robin was safe.

28:04.983 --> 28:07.213
Maybe you don't know him
as well as you think.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.112
- Describe him.
- Well, he... he was short,

28:11.189 --> 28:13.487
had-had a mustache,
uh, slight paunch,

28:13.558 --> 28:15.685
spoke with a British accent.
Did he tip you?

28:15.761 --> 28:18.286
Twenty bucks.
That's not Higgins, Thomas.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.354
I know.

28:27.939 --> 28:30.032
I remember once in '42,

28:30.108 --> 28:34.101
I was attached to Alexander's command when a
group of Tuaregs captured me on the Qattara.

28:34.179 --> 28:36.238
Must have been 130 in the shade.

28:36.314 --> 28:40.546
Just going out on patrol in that heat
was enough to drive some blokes balmy.

28:40.619 --> 28:42.780
Now, technically,
the Tuaregs were on our side,

28:42.854 --> 28:45.584
but actually they worked
for the highest bidder.

28:45.657 --> 28:47.682
I say, that smarts.

28:47.759 --> 28:51.320
Well, Jerry had paid them in gold, and
since I only had British pound notes,

28:51.396 --> 28:53.557
well, you can see the spot I was in.

28:53.632 --> 28:55.725
Uh, sodium pentothal?

28:55.801 --> 28:59.328
- Oh, nothing that old-fashioned.
- Of course, I should have known.

29:00.338 --> 29:02.272
Now, where was I?

29:02.340 --> 29:04.638
Oh, yes.

29:04.710 --> 29:09.306
Well, they tied me out in the heat.
Without my hat, of course.

29:09.381 --> 29:10.939
Where are the tapes?

29:12.584 --> 29:14.950
Bloody hot in the Qattara.

29:16.621 --> 29:19.749
Only Robin knows
where the tapes are.

29:21.359 --> 29:24.658
Oh, my, this drug is very fast acting.

29:26.298 --> 29:29.790
I've always been afraid of the sun...

29:29.868 --> 29:32.029
since the Qattara.

29:32.104 --> 29:36.268
Without you,
who will handle security?

29:38.410 --> 29:41.243
Zeus, Apollo.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.809
Good lads.

29:44.883 --> 29:46.817
I understand what he means.

29:46.885 --> 29:48.443
Keep going, Lisa.

29:51.089 --> 29:53.853
You really like him, don't you?

29:53.925 --> 29:57.326
Higgins? Like him?

29:57.395 --> 30:01.855
The way he sics the dogs on me,
makes me trade to use the bathroom?

30:01.933 --> 30:03.867
Like him?

30:03.935 --> 30:07.462
Yes, like him. He's interesting.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.268
So are you.

30:15.147 --> 30:19.607
Huh. Found some change in here.
Should we split it or give it to Robin?

30:19.684 --> 30:22.118
Now what are you after?

30:22.187 --> 30:24.155
I'm not after anything.

30:24.222 --> 30:26.850
Um, I mean, I am.

30:26.925 --> 30:30.019
But I'm not.
Uh, not the way you mean anyway.

30:30.095 --> 30:33.792
Oh, God. Why am I so... so tongue-tied?

30:33.865 --> 30:36.834
My father used to do that to me.

30:36.902 --> 30:39.427
Not that I'm comparing you
to my father.

30:39.504 --> 30:42.905
Although he was a private investigator
who didn't make it very big.

30:42.974 --> 30:46.910
I didn't mean that
you wouldn't be big.

30:46.978 --> 30:50.709
Uh, just that he was too soft
to ever make it.

30:51.817 --> 30:55.685
He wouldn't approve of you
coming on to a guy as part of the job.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.656
No. He wouldn't.

30:59.958 --> 31:04.418
Tell me, just how far were you willing
to go to get into the estate?

31:04.496 --> 31:06.930
I came on to you,
or rather, didn't come on to you,

31:06.998 --> 31:09.933
because I felt that was the best way
to get you interested...

31:10.001 --> 31:11.935
because I had to get in here somehow.

31:12.003 --> 31:14.801
Higgins does do a fairly good job
of keeping this place secure.

31:14.873 --> 31:19.071
I had to think of something
to penetrate security in a hurry.

31:20.545 --> 31:23.776
But I really couldn't have
pulled it off if there hadn't been...

31:23.849 --> 31:25.874
some sort of attraction.

31:28.019 --> 31:30.681
I am not that good of an actress.

31:30.755 --> 31:32.780
I think you are.

31:33.792 --> 31:36.226
No, Tom.

31:36.294 --> 31:38.285
I'm not.

31:44.102 --> 31:46.764
I know. You think
I'm being taken in by a kiss.

31:46.838 --> 31:52.572
Well, you're wrong. It takes more than one kiss from a
warm, attractive, bright-eyed woman to change my mind.

32:05.290 --> 32:09.454
Um, Higgins is
out there somewhere.

32:09.527 --> 32:12.325
Yeah. We have a job to do.

32:19.004 --> 32:21.234
What's the password, Higgins?

32:21.306 --> 32:23.968
How very original.
Open the gate, please.

32:24.042 --> 32:27.307
Gee, I'm just trying to
cheer you up, Higgin...

32:27.379 --> 32:29.574
Higgins had the tape on
when he left the estate.

32:32.717 --> 32:34.776
You can't possibly get away with this.

32:34.853 --> 32:38.118
Why don't you just drive.
Let me worry about getting away with it.

32:38.189 --> 32:42.285
Whoever grabbed Higgins didn't realize
the tape recorder was on.

32:42.360 --> 32:45.557
But Higgins did.
I had to give the little majordomo credit.

32:45.630 --> 32:48.963
- He was leading us straight to them.
- Served there in '39,you know.

32:49.034 --> 32:51.229
I say, Laseronics.

32:51.303 --> 32:54.431
I do hope you're not
going to use a laser on me.

32:54.506 --> 32:59.307
It's a low frequency transmitting station they use
to communicate with their nuclear submarines.

32:59.377 --> 33:03.040
I was stationed here
for a while in the navy.

33:03.114 --> 33:07.107
They sold it at public auction when they
switched to satellite communications.

33:09.054 --> 33:12.820
Well, Laseronics probably has it
as secured as tight as the navy did.

33:12.891 --> 33:16.258
That's a stun fence.
I can see the probes and generating boxes.

33:17.295 --> 33:19.559
Besides dogs,
they've probably got, um,

33:19.631 --> 33:22.031
sonic alerts, video cameras.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.864
Only their security people
probably know what else.

33:25.937 --> 33:29.373
To reach the subs underwater,
the navy used frequencies so low...

33:29.441 --> 33:31.705
the antennas stretched
from one mountain to the other.

33:31.776 --> 33:33.801
Look to the left
of where they're anchored.

33:38.016 --> 33:41.315
I don't think they'd expect anyone
climbing down on 'em from up there.

33:41.386 --> 33:45.049
It's gonna be tough getting in there.
Maybe not.

33:45.123 --> 33:47.057
How are we gonna get up there?

33:47.125 --> 33:49.457
The same way the navy
put up those antennas.

35:17.682 --> 35:19.616
Yes, I'll check on it.

35:19.684 --> 35:21.618
Uh-huh.

35:30.028 --> 35:32.622
I'll check on it then.

35:32.697 --> 35:35.029
Not... No, not to my knowledge, no.

35:56.888 --> 36:00.756
I'll have a scotch.
And no bloody ice, please.

36:13.071 --> 36:15.904
Higgins, you okay?
It's me, Magnum.

36:15.974 --> 36:18.966
Zeus, Apollo, kill.

36:19.043 --> 36:20.908
Must be a reflex action.

36:20.979 --> 36:24.540
He's been drugged. It's probably
a thiosodium-based truth serum.

36:24.616 --> 36:27.244
It's very effective,

36:27.318 --> 36:29.343
but it'll leave him a bit drunk.

36:31.055 --> 36:33.888
- How are you gonna get him out?
- Out?

36:33.958 --> 36:36.256
- I'm out?
- I'll carry him.

36:36.327 --> 36:39.353
But I'm a sergeant major
with the Prince of Wales's...

36:39.430 --> 36:41.364
own West Yorkshire Regiment.

36:41.432 --> 36:44.868
- Up the mountain? That's impossible.
- Impossible? Nothing's impossible.

36:44.936 --> 36:48.303
We'll argue about it at the top. Handcuff
his arms around me. Once, in North Africa,

36:48.373 --> 36:51.274
when a couple of lads and I
had to raid a Jerry supply dump,

36:51.342 --> 36:54.106
we ran into a bunch of
bedouin women on a camel.

36:54.179 --> 36:56.647
Dromedary actually.
Here we go, Higgins.

37:04.222 --> 37:07.589
Bloody filthy animals.
All they want to do is spit on you.

37:07.659 --> 37:09.650
Sergeant Major,
jerry patrol up ahead.

37:09.727 --> 37:12.753
Right. Mum's the word, lads.

37:29.647 --> 37:32.445
Air raid. Air raid. Take cover.

37:33.451 --> 37:35.544
Get behind the door.

38:14.991 --> 38:16.982
Steady, lads.

38:19.488 --> 38:21.523
This reminds me of Nepal,

38:21.598 --> 38:23.532
fall of'43.

38:23.600 --> 38:29.300
I was ordered to get supplies to a Chinese
guerrilla outfit fighting high in the Himalayas.

38:32.242 --> 38:34.870
Hold your fire.

38:34.945 --> 38:36.879
We've got what we want anyway.

38:36.947 --> 38:39.711
No one had ever crossed
the Himalayas that late in the year.

38:39.783 --> 38:42.911
Even Lord Mountbatten, God rest his
soul, didn't think it could be done.

38:42.986 --> 38:45.386
But we were fusiliers.

38:45.456 --> 38:49.722
I left with 25 men and a Sherpa
guide on the eighth of October.

38:49.793 --> 38:51.920
We hit snow at 10,000 feet.

38:51.995 --> 38:56.227
And I can tell you, with 50-pound packs
on our backs, it was bloody hell.

38:56.300 --> 38:59.633
Lost our poor guide somewhere
around 12,000 in an avalanche.

38:59.703 --> 39:02.194
Higgins, shut up.!

39:05.809 --> 39:07.538
I'm really quite speechless.

39:07.611 --> 39:11.752
It's about time. I couldn't help myself.
They gave me some sort of truth serum.

39:11.777 --> 39:14.474
It... made me run on a bit.
A bit?

39:14.542 --> 39:17.418
It won't happen again. I assure you.
What'd they ask you, anyway?

39:17.488 --> 39:20.321
Same thing, over and over.
Where were Robin's tapes?

39:20.390 --> 39:23.951
Of course, since I didn't know,
I couldn't tell them, could I?

39:27.147 --> 39:29.138
Yes, Rick.

39:29.215 --> 39:32.616
I got company. Be right there.

39:35.424 --> 39:39.758
Tom? No, I'm just gonna lay
here and rest till the big one.

39:46.049 --> 39:47.949
Higgins, get on the other phone...

39:47.974 --> 39:51.535
and find out if Starguard provides
security for any biggies at Laseronics.

39:51.560 --> 39:54.085
What?
Just do it for once, will ya?

39:55.759 --> 39:58.387
This is Thomas Magnum.
I'd like to speak to Robin Masters.

40:02.632 --> 40:06.796
Roger, Honolulu approach. Robin
triple five, 200 nautical miles out,

40:06.870 --> 40:09.304
descending to flight level
one, five, zero.

40:10.307 --> 40:12.275
Hello, Thomas.

40:15.512 --> 40:18.948
I knew letting you stay at the guesthouse
would pay off some day,

40:19.015 --> 40:21.848
despite what Higgins says.

40:27.657 --> 40:33.425
It was hard for Mark to believe that
anyone so beautiful, so desirable,

40:33.497 --> 40:38.093
could be so deadly. Magnum, Higgins.
I have a bit of a surprise.

40:38.168 --> 40:41.604
I'd like you to meet the president
of Starguard, David Clark.

40:41.671 --> 40:44.162
Digger's told me how helpful
the two of you have been.

40:44.241 --> 40:46.209
Especially you, Higgins.

40:46.276 --> 40:48.301
Me?

40:48.378 --> 40:50.778
Well, I, uh...

40:52.582 --> 40:55.244
think I'll answer that.

40:55.318 --> 40:57.980
Yes, Mr. Masters.

40:58.054 --> 41:00.284
A helicopter is standing by
at the airport.

41:00.357 --> 41:02.416
Of course... I'll be there.

41:02.492 --> 41:04.756
It's here. Robin's coming here.

41:04.828 --> 41:08.025
He's landing in 30 minutes. He's asked
that I meet him at the airport.

41:08.098 --> 41:10.362
- Will that be all right?
- Of course.

41:10.434 --> 41:12.732
Oh, I'm sorry, D-David.
Since you're here...

41:12.803 --> 41:14.464
Oh, no. It's your show, Digger.

41:14.538 --> 41:18.736
Although I would like to look over your
defenses and then make some phone calls.

41:18.809 --> 41:22.643
I've got three other clients spread around the
world in vulnerable situations at the moment.

41:22.712 --> 41:25.340
I'll alert Rick at the gate.
I'll get the car.

41:37.994 --> 41:41.122
Robin's due within the hour. I expect
to get hit when the chopper lands.

41:41.198 --> 41:43.758
- It'll be a diversion.
- Where's the main attack coming from?

41:43.834 --> 41:45.597
Inside. What?

41:45.669 --> 41:49.935
Rick, I don't have time to explain it all now. Just
don't let anybody pull you off this post, okay?

41:50.006 --> 41:53.999
- Wait a minute. Did I ever leave my post?
- Yeah. Outside Chu Lai, remember?

41:54.077 --> 41:56.238
Remember the girl?

41:56.313 --> 42:00.374
Once. One time some dame suckers me,
and he's not gonna let me forget it.

42:02.018 --> 42:04.179
Where's your leader?
On the phone.

42:05.689 --> 42:07.850
Tom, what's wrong?
Oh, Robin's new book.

42:07.924 --> 42:11.416
It's about selling top secret
laser technology to the Russians.

42:11.495 --> 42:14.089
Laseronics, where we found Higgins.

42:14.164 --> 42:17.065
Uh-huh. And guess who protects
the president of Laseronics?

42:17.133 --> 42:19.067
Who?

42:19.135 --> 42:22.901
Starguard?
Ooh. That was very good.

42:22.973 --> 42:27.376
The touch of surprise, the raised eyebrow.
Tom, I swear I didn't know.

42:27.444 --> 42:29.776
We have a client list
of over a thousand.

42:29.846 --> 42:31.973
I know less than a... a hundred
in Los Angeles.

42:32.983 --> 42:35.349
Even so, it could have been
just a coincidence.

42:37.220 --> 42:38.915
What made you check
in the first place?

42:38.989 --> 42:42.550
Well, Laseronics had all the little
goodies that you wanted to put in here.

42:42.626 --> 42:46.619
And then that sneeze just as we were
about to get out undetected.

42:48.331 --> 42:50.822
I couldn't help that sneeze.

42:51.835 --> 42:54.827
You th...
You think I'm involved, don't you?

42:54.905 --> 42:58.204
Why don't we put it
to the old test, Digger?

43:05.148 --> 43:08.117
I know. I'm a sucker for tears.

43:08.184 --> 43:10.846
But damn it, sometimes you just
gotta go with your gut instincts,

43:10.921 --> 43:14.186
even if it kills you.
I need your help to save Robin.

43:16.159 --> 43:21.222
- You trust me?
- Yeah. I trust you.

44:12.682 --> 44:15.674
Thomas, I got company.

44:15.752 --> 44:18.448
A survey crew.
As if anyone would believe that one.

44:18.521 --> 44:20.955
And, man,
are they makin' it look obvious.

44:21.024 --> 44:23.015
Roger.

44:24.828 --> 44:27.319
Survey construction truck
just pulled up.

44:27.397 --> 44:30.093
Can Rick handle it? You and
Magnum better check it out.

44:54.791 --> 44:56.019
Digger!

44:56.092 --> 44:59.721
Digger.! I'll take care of Robin.
Stop them at the gate.

45:24.587 --> 45:27.556
Higgins, cover the guesthouse.
They may try and sneak in that way.

45:32.028 --> 45:33.052
Uh-huh.

45:49.713 --> 45:52.648
Magnum, they've got Higgins
pinned down on the beach.

45:54.350 --> 45:56.614
Damn.

45:58.455 --> 46:00.480
I'll take the tapes, Robin.

46:06.329 --> 46:08.729
He doesn't have them, David.

46:08.798 --> 46:10.789
Robin does.

46:30.353 --> 46:33.550
You shouldn't have trusted me, Tom.

46:34.991 --> 46:38.722
Why not?
Because it wasn't the smart thing to do.

46:38.795 --> 46:43.129
Once you knew there was a tie
between Starguard and Laseronics,

46:43.199 --> 46:46.930
you couldn't trust anyone
working for Starguard,

46:47.003 --> 46:48.231
including me.

46:48.304 --> 46:50.966
Yes, I could. How?

46:52.008 --> 46:56.001
You're doing this on
purpose, aren't you? Uh-huh.

47:11.661 --> 47:13.652
What?

47:15.732 --> 47:18.200
Uh... Uh, good evening.

47:18.268 --> 47:21.396
I, uh, thought you might like to know
that Robin Masters phoned.

47:21.471 --> 47:24.497
Uh, the tapes are safely in the hands
of his publisher.

47:24.574 --> 47:26.439
Great.

47:26.509 --> 47:30.104
Oh. And, uh, 5-0 apprehended those two
associates of David's at the airport.

47:30.180 --> 47:32.671
I'm going down to identify them.

47:32.749 --> 47:34.808
That's terrific, Higgins.

47:34.884 --> 47:36.875
Yes, I thought so.

47:36.953 --> 47:40.650
And so was your plan, Magnum,
to switch places with Robin.

47:40.723 --> 47:42.714
But...

47:42.792 --> 47:45.556
I still don't know how you knew...

47:45.628 --> 47:47.858
Robin's tapes were in the guesthouse.

47:47.931 --> 47:51.958
Robin asked me to hold them for him
last time he was here.

47:52.035 --> 47:54.435
You mean you had them all along?
Yes. Now, Higgins...

47:54.504 --> 47:58.634
- Well, where were they hidden? - They weren't.
I just put them with the rest of my cassettes.

48:00.343 --> 48:04.006
You mean you had Robin's manuscript
just laying out in the open with...

48:04.080 --> 48:06.981
Jefferson Starship,
Blondie and Styx?

48:07.050 --> 48:09.518
There was also Mozart,
Bach and Beethoven.

48:09.586 --> 48:13.886
Now, Higgins, if you don't mind, Digger and
I were comparing investigative techniques.

48:13.957 --> 48:17.393
It's fascinating how one can
camouflage something that way.

48:17.460 --> 48:20.054
I remember back in '63.

48:20.129 --> 48:23.860
I was assigned to an army investigative
unit in the north of Wales.

48:23.933 --> 48:25.867
Had a fascinating case.

48:25.935 --> 48:28.403
It seems this private
killed his corporal in the latrine...

48:28.471 --> 48:33.101
because his sergeant had told the private
that corporals are invariably homosexual.

48:33.176 --> 48:35.906
Then they straighten up again when
they get their sergeant stripes.

48:35.979 --> 48:39.005
It's an odd story.
