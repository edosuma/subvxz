01:18.389 --> 01:21.017
A little bit of magic time.

01:21.058 --> 01:24.061
I feel it.

01:27.022 --> 01:29.984
Yes, sir.

01:34.989 --> 01:39.368
Terrific shot!
I'm in the goddamn woods again.

01:39.409 --> 01:41.495
Goddamn it.

01:41.537 --> 01:43.914
Damn game.

01:43.956 --> 01:46.875
Damn it.

01:50.170 --> 01:54.799
I spend more time in the trees
than the squirrels.

02:01.222 --> 02:04.642
Wizard Two? Why not?

02:11.024 --> 02:13.860
Not again.

02:13.901 --> 02:18.823
<i>I've had five heart attacks
in the last 10 years.</i>

02:18.906 --> 02:22.201
<i>My first was on a golf course
in South Carolina.</i>

02:22.243 --> 02:26.455
<i>It wasn't that bad. A couple of
doglegs that were more dog than leg.</i>

02:26.497 --> 02:29.291
<u>All in all, it was playable.</u>

02:29.333 --> 02:32.711
<i>Assuming you didn't die
on the second hole.</i>

02:32.753 --> 02:36.548
<i>The second coronary was at Augusta,
where they had the Masters.</i>

02:36.590 --> 02:38.759
<i>Went down on the first fairway.</i>

02:38.801 --> 02:43.514
<i>Good thing too, because those greens
would have been the end of me anyway.</i>

02:43.555 --> 02:47.142
<i>My wife used to ask me
before she passed on:</i>

02:47.184 --> 02:51.897
<i>Why do I play a game that
seems destined to kill me?</i>

02:52.147 --> 02:54.858
<i>It all started back in 1928...</i>

02:54.900 --> 02:59.654
<i>... when I was just a youngster
in Savannah, Georgia.</i>

03:05.535 --> 03:08.872
Jones and Hagen are really
at it. Neck and neck.

03:08.913 --> 03:11.291
- Nuts!
- Remember that drive he hit?

03:11.332 --> 03:14.794
- Was it 350?
- More like 400 with the roll.

03:14.836 --> 03:17.088
I don't care how good they are.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.924
Junuh could beat them
with his eyes closed.

03:19.966 --> 03:21.801
He won three times in a row.

03:21.843 --> 03:24.929
<i>When I was growing up,
every town had its heroes.</i>

03:24.971 --> 03:26.931
<i>Ours was Rannulph Junuh.</i>

03:26.973 --> 03:29.684
<i>An athlete who was a born winner.</i>

03:29.725 --> 03:33.687
<i>How I wanted to be just like him.</i>

03:48.994 --> 03:53.290
Junuh has the most difficult shot
in the history of golf.

03:53.332 --> 03:57.669
He must sink this shot from 110 yards
to win the championship.

03:57.711 --> 03:59.671
He steps up to the ball.

03:59.713 --> 04:02.674
The crowd is hushed in anticipation.

04:02.716 --> 04:05.051
Can he make this miracle shot?

04:05.093 --> 04:06.428
And he swings!

04:06.469 --> 04:08.263
Fore! Watch your heads!

04:08.305 --> 04:11.057
- Where did that come from?
- I don't know!

04:11.099 --> 04:14.435
There he is!

04:19.274 --> 04:22.777
<i>I'd never seen him play
since it was before I was born...</i>

04:22.819 --> 04:28.366
<i>... but it was said Junuh was on track
to being the greatest golfer ever.</i>

04:29.909 --> 04:34.080
<i>"Titanic off the tee."
"Approach shots which fell to earth. "</i>

04:34.121 --> 04:39.126
<i>As Sam Snead once put it,
"Like a butterfly with sore feet."</i>

04:39.168 --> 04:41.253
<i>He won just about everything.</i>

04:41.295 --> 04:44.590
<i>But even he would say
his most significant victory...</i>

04:44.632 --> 04:48.260
<i>... was winning the heart
of Adele Invergordon.</i>

04:48.302 --> 04:52.639
<i>Daughter of the wealthiest man
in Savannah.</i>

05:45.191 --> 05:48.944
<i>But fate plays funny tricks.</i>

05:51.905 --> 05:54.508
<i>It was a patriotic call to arms...</i>

05:54.550 --> 05:58.579
<i>... to fight the war to end all wars.</i>

05:58.620 --> 06:02.291
<i>Junuh and everyone in town
believed it was his destiny...</i>

06:02.332 --> 06:06.962
<i>... to lead the young men of Savannah
into battle.</i>

06:13.426 --> 06:17.097
<i>It was to be his crowning glory.</i>

06:17.138 --> 06:20.308
<i>But nothing could have
prepared him or anyone...</i>

06:20.350 --> 06:24.729
<i>... for the shock and sorrow
of what was to come.</i>

06:27.357 --> 06:29.067
- Positions.
- Ready, captain.

06:29.108 --> 06:31.569
- Get ready. Positions.
- Ready, sir.

06:31.611 --> 06:33.863
Prepare to advance.

06:33.905 --> 06:35.406
Sergeant...

06:35.448 --> 06:39.327
- Advance!
- Advance!

07:41.304 --> 07:44.515
<i>Confused, broken...</i>

07:44.557 --> 07:49.353
<i>... and unable to face a return
to a hero's welcome...</i>

07:49.687 --> 07:53.357
<i>... Junuh just disappeared.</i>

07:56.360 --> 07:59.697
<i>Hoping to forget...</i>

07:59.738 --> 08:03.283
<i>... and to be forgotten.</i>

08:04.326 --> 08:09.915
<i>But Adele, being a woman of the South,
had survived worse than desertion.</i>

08:10.249 --> 08:15.128
<i>And she moved on with her life,
dedicating herself to her father's dream.</i>

08:15.170 --> 08:19.174
What we have here is the most magnificent
golf resort on God's earth...

08:19.216 --> 08:21.635
...and I'm building it
here in Savannah.

08:21.676 --> 08:25.555
Krewe Island.
Legacy to my sweet Adele.

08:25.597 --> 08:29.601
And we'd like to use all of you
as our main suppliers.

08:29.642 --> 08:31.644
Thank you, that's quite an honor.

08:31.686 --> 08:33.897
I wouldn't dream of anything but.

08:33.938 --> 08:36.232
People don't obey, we'll repeal.

08:36.274 --> 08:39.777
We can't repeal the Commandments,
they don't obey that.

08:39.818 --> 08:43.740
Yet no law on the statute book--

08:56.877 --> 09:01.423
<i>I was 10 years old
when Junuh came home.</i>

09:13.060 --> 09:15.854
Stop!

09:53.349 --> 09:58.312
<i>Less than a year later,
the Great Depression hit Savannah.</i>

10:06.737 --> 10:11.450
<i>Jobs were lost.
Stores and banks were shut for good.</i>

10:12.493 --> 10:16.997
<i>And John Invergordon, having spent
his last dime on his great dream...</i>

10:17.039 --> 10:22.294
<i>... opened Krewe Island on what should
have been a glorious spring day.</i>

10:55.034 --> 10:58.120
<i>It might not have been a shot
heard around the world...</i>

10:58.162 --> 10:59.372
Oh, Daddy.

10:59.413 --> 11:02.166
<i>... but it reached every
corner of Savannah.</i>

11:02.208 --> 11:05.002
Amen.

11:10.674 --> 11:14.595
I'll be putting some doors and closets
in the parlor.

11:14.637 --> 11:18.474
With any luck, we can have
boarders within a few weeks.

11:18.515 --> 11:22.769
Hardy, can you share your room
with Cara Mae?

11:22.811 --> 11:26.273
What about the store?

12:17.656 --> 12:20.409
Oh, Jesus.

12:20.451 --> 12:24.163
I've died and gone to hell.

12:25.998 --> 12:30.502
It's not as if you have a choice.
Your golf resort is dead and gone.

12:30.544 --> 12:33.005
You've got no gumption, Neskaloosa.

12:33.046 --> 12:35.549
My gumption is not the subject.

12:35.590 --> 12:37.634
Then what is the subject?

12:37.676 --> 12:41.846
If it's your offer to take it for
one-tenth of what my father spent--

12:41.888 --> 12:44.432
You're lucky to get
a dime on the dollar.

12:44.474 --> 12:47.310
Just so you can turn around
and resell it...

12:47.352 --> 12:50.563
...to some Carolina paper mill
for a tidy profit?

12:50.605 --> 12:54.192
That you've likely made the deal
already is not my problem.

12:54.234 --> 12:58.446
We should come back when the shock
of your father's passing isn't so--

12:58.488 --> 12:59.739
God.

12:59.781 --> 13:02.033
Don't bother. I'm not selling.

13:02.075 --> 13:06.204
You got a stack of debts
that would fill the Cotton Exchange.

13:06.245 --> 13:08.873
And I intend to pay them off...
in time.

13:08.915 --> 13:10.791
With what? Ball tokens?

13:10.833 --> 13:14.545
With the money people will spend once
they know it's the premier resort.

13:14.587 --> 13:18.883
Did I miss something? Or are we not
in the midst of a Great Depression?

13:18.924 --> 13:22.386
People still have money
and I'll make sure they know--

13:22.428 --> 13:25.556
How exactly do you intend
to accomplish that?

13:25.597 --> 13:26.974
How?

13:27.015 --> 13:29.351
- Well, how?
- How?

13:29.393 --> 13:32.729
I'll tell you how.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.278
I'll have the greatest
exhibition match ever held...

13:40.320 --> 13:44.074
...on the greatest golf course
ever built.

13:44.115 --> 13:46.618
- Bobby Jones...
- Bobby Jones?

13:46.660 --> 13:49.120
- ...will be playing Walter Hagen...
- Walter Hagen?

13:49.162 --> 13:50.997
...for $ 10,000.

13:51.039 --> 13:53.666
- What?
- $ 10,000? You can't be serious.

13:53.708 --> 13:57.378
$ 10,000 for one weekend?

13:57.921 --> 14:01.090
I'd make it more, gentlemen...

14:01.132 --> 14:04.552
...but that's about all
I believe I can raise...

14:04.594 --> 14:07.972
...if I sell everything I own
on this earth.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.724
Except Krewe Island.

14:09.765 --> 14:12.435
Jones and Hagen
are coming to Krewe Island?

14:12.476 --> 14:15.479
To play an exhibition
match for 10 grand?

14:15.521 --> 14:17.565
That's correct.

14:17.606 --> 14:21.235
They don't know it yet,
but that's what they'll be doing.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.028
Are you off your rocker?

14:23.070 --> 14:28.200
Nobody has the right to call
Krewe Island "Invergordon's Folly."

14:28.242 --> 14:31.995
Nobody. Good day, gentlemen.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.917
Adele!

14:38.126 --> 14:43.048
Nobody holds your father responsible
for this depression!

14:45.258 --> 14:47.385
You're a damn fool!

14:47.427 --> 14:49.971
Save your breath, judge. She'll sell.

14:50.013 --> 14:52.390
You really think Jones and Hagen...

14:52.432 --> 14:57.520
...will come to Krewe Island
just because she wants them to?

15:03.401 --> 15:06.946
All four golf championships
in a single year.

15:06.988 --> 15:10.158
The Grand Slam. Simply amazing.

15:10.199 --> 15:13.536
I don't believe that's been done
in the history of golf.

15:13.578 --> 15:15.162
No, it--

15:15.204 --> 15:17.206
It takes my breath away.

15:17.248 --> 15:20.918
You don't impress me
as someone who loses her breath.

15:20.960 --> 15:24.588
Did you know that reprobate,
Mr. Walter Hagen...

15:24.630 --> 15:27.716
...who I hear spends every minute
chasing after women...

15:27.758 --> 15:32.262
...has been approached to play in the
$10,000 Krewe Island exhibition match?

15:32.304 --> 15:34.390
No, I didn't.

15:34.431 --> 15:39.186
But how is this an urgent
matter for the American Red Cross?

15:39.228 --> 15:42.940
- Did I say that?
- At the front door.

15:42.981 --> 15:45.233
May I speak candidly, Mr. Jones?

15:45.275 --> 15:47.652
I wish you would.

15:47.694 --> 15:50.489
I've come here to see you because...

15:50.530 --> 15:53.074
...to the South, you're a hero.

15:53.116 --> 15:55.827
They see you as a young god.

15:55.869 --> 15:57.621
Brave, valiant...

15:57.662 --> 15:59.706
...glorious.

15:59.748 --> 16:03.126
One of the greatest golfers
in the world today.

16:03.168 --> 16:05.545
I would say "the greatest golfer" ...

16:05.587 --> 16:09.007
...were it not for that
incident last year...

16:09.048 --> 16:14.554
...when Mr. Hagen whupped you by
12 strokes on your very own course.

16:15.721 --> 16:20.351
You say he's been invited to play
at Krewe Island?

16:29.944 --> 16:32.655
She has a remarkable talent,
Mr. Hagen.

16:32.696 --> 16:35.908
I hit the ball.

16:36.575 --> 16:41.413
I wonder if you might excuse us
for a minute, Anna Mae?

16:42.831 --> 16:45.209
I won't be long.

16:45.250 --> 16:49.087
A charming woman. Although,
she gave me quite a fright.

16:49.129 --> 16:53.133
With so much weight in front,
I swore she'd topple over...

16:53.175 --> 16:56.428
...before she ever got to her knees.

16:56.470 --> 16:58.930
I do admire a man with your...

16:58.972 --> 17:01.057
...vitality.

17:01.099 --> 17:04.435
The South is in such an
unfortunate place these days...

17:04.477 --> 17:06.354
...and Savannah most of all.

17:06.396 --> 17:10.733
Memories of our defeat in the war
between the States still linger...

17:10.775 --> 17:13.528
...and with them,
the defeated men who returned...

17:13.569 --> 17:16.864
...lacking that vigor
we women associate with your gender.

17:16.906 --> 17:21.786
Now, sadly, here is Savannah, teeming
with the most attractive young women...

17:21.828 --> 17:25.748
...and nobody, absolutely nobody,
to satisfy them.

17:25.790 --> 17:31.462
Except for Bobby Jones, who will be
playing in our Krewe Island tournament.

17:32.838 --> 17:36.050
He says, "It don't matter
what it is, it won't hurt you.

17:36.091 --> 17:40.596
You just pop one in your mouth
and you chew."

17:42.348 --> 17:45.893
I'm pleased to announce
Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen...

17:45.934 --> 17:48.604
...have accepted
my golfing invitation...

17:48.645 --> 17:52.107
...with enthusiasm.

17:52.774 --> 17:54.818
First, of course...

17:54.860 --> 17:59.823
...Miss Adele Invergordon's commitment
to her father's dream.

18:00.365 --> 18:03.660
<i>Not one to concede defeat easily...</i>

18:03.702 --> 18:07.580
<i>... Neskaloosa engineered an
uprising against the tournament.</i>

18:07.622 --> 18:12.085
You boys think I've been drinking
too much blackjack tea...

18:12.127 --> 18:14.671
...but they'll be parking
in our streets...

18:14.712 --> 18:17.674
...and taxing the limits
of our constabulary--

18:17.715 --> 18:20.885
Do you think one of them
damn rich Yankees...

18:20.927 --> 18:25.098
...gives a hoot about Savannah
or anybody in it?

18:25.139 --> 18:26.516
Now, now.

18:26.557 --> 18:29.018
Now, we need the Yankees...

18:29.060 --> 18:33.356
...but we also need someone
from Savannah in the match.

18:33.397 --> 18:35.107
One of us giving them...

18:35.149 --> 18:38.861
...a run for their money.
Then they'll know what we're made of.

18:38.903 --> 18:43.324
We need someone from Savannah
playing in our tournament!

18:43.365 --> 18:45.659
What about Dougal McDermott?

18:45.701 --> 18:48.829
He's a Scot and only
comes into town to get drunk!

18:48.871 --> 18:52.499
- Bobby Jones is from Atlanta!
- I said, Savannah!

18:52.541 --> 18:54.918
- The South. The real South.
- Yeah.

18:55.060 --> 18:59.006
<i>Neskaloosa knew the golden rule
of politics better than anyone.</i>

18:59.047 --> 19:01.466
<i>If you can't beat them, lead them.</i>

19:01.508 --> 19:04.219
All right, hold it!
Hold it, everyone!

19:04.261 --> 19:06.513
There's one person we're forgetting.

19:06.555 --> 19:11.142
We all know there's one man who hits
gargantuan drives off the tee...

19:11.184 --> 19:14.145
...and has a lock-picker's touch
on the greens...

19:14.187 --> 19:18.983
...Savannah's own
Enderby "Cottonmouth" Conyngham!

19:22.153 --> 19:23.863
Wait a minute!

19:23.905 --> 19:25.239
He's 80 years old!

19:25.281 --> 19:30.369
He'd need one caddy to carry
his clubs, and two to carry him!

19:32.747 --> 19:34.498
Junuh could whup them both.

19:34.540 --> 19:38.753
You're off your rocker. He couldn't
whup a dead possum in a sack.

19:38.794 --> 19:41.255
- That ain't true.
- Oh, yeah?

19:41.297 --> 19:42.965
What about Captain Junuh?

19:43.007 --> 19:46.560
- Who?
- Captain Junuh.

19:46.602 --> 19:50.306
My Dad says he's the greatest golfer
Savannah ever had!

19:50.347 --> 19:52.433
- Hardy.
- Well, it's true!

19:52.474 --> 19:54.560
You said it a hundred times!

19:54.601 --> 19:55.894
Sit down, son.

19:55.936 --> 19:57.646
The boy's got a point!

19:57.688 --> 20:00.399
- Junuh's born and bred in Savannah.
- Exactly!

20:00.440 --> 20:01.775
That is the point!

20:01.817 --> 20:04.312
- What ever happened to him?
- He gave up golf.

20:04.453 --> 20:08.998
Forget Rannulph Junuh, assuming
you can locate his whereabouts.

20:09.140 --> 20:10.867
I hear he's so far gone...

20:10.909 --> 20:13.912
...he wouldn't know
a putter from a pussy willow.

20:13.954 --> 20:17.582
I know where to find him!

20:18.249 --> 20:21.419
You find him, Hardy,
and we will be there.

20:21.461 --> 20:23.046
Fly, lad...

20:23.087 --> 20:27.258
...with winged sandals on your feet!

20:33.306 --> 20:36.559
<i>If I live to be 1000,
which doesn't seem likely...</i>

20:36.601 --> 20:40.021
<i>... I'll never know where
I got the courage to call out.</i>

20:40.062 --> 20:44.275
<i>But once I did, I wasn't backing down.</i>

21:09.675 --> 21:14.387
This could've been the stupidest idea
I've ever had.

21:23.313 --> 21:26.316
Captain Junuh?

21:26.357 --> 21:29.152
Captain Junuh?

21:29.194 --> 21:32.905
This is Hardy Greaves, sir.

22:02.976 --> 22:06.605
Jacks. All you be holding on guts.

22:06.647 --> 22:08.565
I need new shoes.

22:08.607 --> 22:11.151
You're crazy.
Get out of here with that.

22:11.193 --> 22:14.154
Make sure you guys save
some money for me.

22:14.196 --> 22:16.364
He ain't gonna win.

22:16.406 --> 22:18.700
What have we here?

22:18.742 --> 22:20.493
Well, well.

22:20.535 --> 22:24.831
Look like we got
a new card player, gents.

22:25.999 --> 22:28.585
It's all right. Don't be scared.

22:28.626 --> 22:30.503
I ain't scared.

22:30.545 --> 22:33.006
I've seen men drunk plenty of times.

22:33.047 --> 22:35.717
- What do they look like?
- It ain't much.

22:35.758 --> 22:38.636
Least not so much
as they seem to think.

22:38.678 --> 22:42.348
But it don't scare me none.

22:42.390 --> 22:48.020
Gentlemen, this is the only male in
Chatham County who isn't full of shit.

22:49.105 --> 22:51.148
What's your name, son?

22:51.190 --> 22:54.652
Hardy. Hardy Greaves.

22:55.778 --> 22:59.782
- You Frank Greaves' boy?
- Yes, sir.

23:01.784 --> 23:04.119
What brings you here, Hardy?

23:04.161 --> 23:08.290
Maybe I better come back
when you're not so busy.

23:08.332 --> 23:10.542
Busy?

23:10.584 --> 23:13.795
I thought you were gonna say "drunk."

23:13.837 --> 23:16.340
But I'm not busy and I'm not drunk.

23:16.381 --> 23:21.470
There ain't enough whiskey in Georgia
to get me drunk enough.

23:22.721 --> 23:26.975
How drunk is drunk enough,
Captain Junuh?

23:27.684 --> 23:31.980
Good question. Sit over here,
I'll tell you what drunk enough is.

23:32.022 --> 23:35.066
Aaron, can you find the young man
a bottle of Nehi?

23:35.108 --> 23:36.442
I expect I could...

23:36.484 --> 23:40.947
...just as long
as I takes my money with me.

23:43.574 --> 23:46.119
Now the question on the table...

23:46.160 --> 23:50.164
...is how drunk is drunk enough?

23:50.248 --> 23:54.210
And the answer is,
it's all a matter of brain cells.

23:54.252 --> 23:55.711
Brain cells?

23:55.753 --> 24:00.800
That's right. Every drink of liquor
you take kills 1000 brain cells.

24:00.841 --> 24:03.844
But that don't matter,
we got billions more.

24:03.886 --> 24:08.557
First the sadness cells die,
so you smile real big.

24:09.183 --> 24:13.812
Then the quiet cells go, so you talk
real loud for no reason at all.

24:13.854 --> 24:16.982
That's okay,
because the stupid cells go next...

24:17.024 --> 24:21.278
...so everything you say
is real smart.

24:21.486 --> 24:23.405
And finally...

24:23.447 --> 24:27.159
...come the memory cells.

24:27.951 --> 24:32.163
These are tough sons of bitches
to kill.

24:33.456 --> 24:37.877
There's a golf match at Krewe Island
between Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen.

24:37.919 --> 24:41.464
And there was a meeting to see
who would play for Savannah.

24:41.506 --> 24:42.966
I said you would.

24:43.007 --> 24:47.762
That's why I'm here,
so you can beat Jones and Hagen.

24:48.971 --> 24:51.599
Hell, I'm drunker than I thought.

24:51.641 --> 24:54.268
- I'll caddy for you.
- You'll caddy for me...

24:54.310 --> 24:56.729
- ...against Jones and Hagen?
- Yes, sir!

24:56.771 --> 24:58.147
I will too.

24:58.189 --> 25:01.025
Aaron will carry the clubs,
I'll carry the balls.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.943
And I'll carry the tees.

25:02.985 --> 25:06.447
And I'll carry Junuh!

25:06.572 --> 25:08.699
I wasn't joking.

25:08.741 --> 25:13.203
I heard my Dad tell how you won
every golf tournament in the South.

25:13.245 --> 25:17.958
And how you hit a drive so long
they made you wait 20 minutes...

25:18.000 --> 25:19.626
...to measure it for a record.

25:19.668 --> 25:23.880
And how you swing righty,
but you were in the woods once...

25:23.922 --> 25:28.385
...and you had no room to swing righty
so you borrowed a lefty club...

25:28.427 --> 25:32.848
...and hit the ball
6 inches from the hole.

25:34.683 --> 25:37.060
It's time for you to go home.

25:37.102 --> 25:38.395
I ain't going!

25:38.436 --> 25:42.649
Suit yourself,
because I'm going to bed.

25:50.114 --> 25:54.077
- Night, gentlemen.
- See you later.

26:03.544 --> 26:05.421
What are you doing in my house?

26:05.463 --> 26:10.217
Trespassing, but on great importance
to Savannah herself.

26:10.259 --> 26:13.470
Some delegate.
Isn't it past his bedtime?

26:13.512 --> 26:18.350
"And a little child shall lead them."

26:18.892 --> 26:23.147
This is a once in a lifetime
opportunity, Junuh.

26:23.188 --> 26:25.649
So, what's in it for you?

26:25.691 --> 26:29.528
Pride in the great city of Savannah
so close to my heart.

26:29.569 --> 26:31.697
So close to all our hearts.

26:31.738 --> 26:34.041
You're wasting your time.
I'm not playing.

26:34.082 --> 26:35.601
Why is that?

26:36.743 --> 26:39.329
I lost my swing.

26:39.371 --> 26:40.830
Then find it!

26:40.872 --> 26:44.584
Goddamn it! Because you're playing.
That's all there is to it!

26:44.626 --> 26:47.212
Savannah needs you.

26:47.253 --> 26:49.923
- Get McDermott. He'll play.
- Balls!

26:49.964 --> 26:52.042
We don't need
some sawed-off Scotsman...

26:52.084 --> 26:55.345
...pooping drives out 40 yards!

26:55.386 --> 26:58.473
We need a man
with thunder in his fist!

26:58.514 --> 27:02.059
A hero to boom that pill out
past those golfing gods!

27:02.101 --> 27:06.856
- We need a knight!
- You're our gentle-born chevalier.

27:09.275 --> 27:12.486
That's one hell of a speech, fellas.

27:12.528 --> 27:14.488
I don't take no for an answer.

27:14.530 --> 27:17.825
Well, you'll have to
because I'm not playing.

27:17.867 --> 27:20.953
Now get out.

27:57.906 --> 28:01.075
Something you picked up
on your travels?

28:01.117 --> 28:03.369
He's not mine.

28:03.411 --> 28:08.332
A little young for a drinking
companion, don't you think?

28:09.458 --> 28:13.421
So, Adele, what can I do for you?

28:14.880 --> 28:18.217
- I think you know why I'm here.
- I do.

28:18.259 --> 28:22.096
A little late to be out
looking for romance, isn't it?

28:22.137 --> 28:25.432
Would that do it?

28:25.975 --> 28:30.604
Would you play in the match
if I had sex with you?

28:30.896 --> 28:32.648
Yeah, that would do it.

28:32.689 --> 28:35.359
Well, that's good, Junuh.

28:35.400 --> 28:38.862
We've seen each other so
infrequently since your return...

28:38.904 --> 28:41.531
...I thought this
was gonna be more difficult.

28:41.573 --> 28:45.035
Where shall we do it?

28:46.161 --> 28:49.539
Right here is fine.

28:52.417 --> 28:54.878
Don't worry, he's out like a light.

28:54.919 --> 28:58.923
Take an earthquake to wake him up.

29:00.800 --> 29:06.556
For an earthquake, you'd have to play
many more tournaments and do very well.

29:14.313 --> 29:15.898
Well?

29:15.940 --> 29:18.943
How do you suggest we begin?

29:18.985 --> 29:21.862
Shall I just run and jump on you...

29:21.904 --> 29:24.907
...or would you like
preliminary romancing.

29:24.949 --> 29:28.202
Romancing sounds good.

29:28.244 --> 29:31.497
Very well, then.

29:36.210 --> 29:38.670
Here's one short kiss.

29:38.712 --> 29:43.884
It is, I'm afraid, all the
romancing I have in me at this time.

30:16.958 --> 30:21.712
I do hope I haven't given the
impression that I'm crying over us.

30:21.754 --> 30:24.256
Because I'm not.

30:24.298 --> 30:27.343
You're not?

30:27.593 --> 30:30.054
No, I'm not.

30:30.095 --> 30:32.806
I'm crying over Savannah.

30:32.848 --> 30:34.475
Savannah?

30:34.516 --> 30:38.812
Over her pain,
and the pain of her people.

30:39.480 --> 30:43.317
- You're in tears over Savannah?
- I am.

30:43.358 --> 30:46.194
I truly am.

30:46.236 --> 30:51.033
Then who'd you take
your clothes off for? Chattanooga?

30:53.785 --> 30:56.580
Well.

30:56.997 --> 31:00.542
This certainly has been
a colossal waste of time.

31:00.583 --> 31:03.086
I didn't ask you to come here.

31:03.128 --> 31:06.798
No, you certainly did not.

31:06.923 --> 31:11.094
You ever get tired of sitting around
feeling sorry for yourself...

31:11.135 --> 31:14.138
...a little golf might
do you some good.

31:14.180 --> 31:17.308
I've lost my swing.

31:17.350 --> 31:20.228
Really?

31:22.396 --> 31:25.650
Where did it go?

31:33.199 --> 31:36.368
You can open your eyes now, Hardy.

31:36.410 --> 31:39.371
Your education is over.

31:39.413 --> 31:42.624
Go on home now.

32:52.860 --> 32:55.028
Who's that?

32:55.070 --> 32:57.906
Just me.

32:57.948 --> 33:01.410
A man trying to find somewhere
to rest his tired feet...

33:01.451 --> 33:05.413
...taking in some of God's glories.
My, what a night!

33:05.455 --> 33:07.958
I could've killed you out there.

33:07.999 --> 33:11.252
No, sir. I set myself directly
in front of you.

33:11.294 --> 33:15.465
Judging by how you hit them balls,
I figured I'd be out of harm's way.

33:15.507 --> 33:18.718
Excuse me, sir.

33:20.678 --> 33:23.014
They say you can tell
a player by his grip.

33:23.056 --> 33:27.226
If you want some food or something,
go into the house, help yourself.

33:27.268 --> 33:31.105
Oh, well, thank you kindly, sir.

33:31.147 --> 33:32.815
I always felt a man's...

33:32.857 --> 33:35.943
...grip on his club just like
a grip on his world.

33:35.985 --> 33:39.447
- Is there something you want?
- Five dollars guaranteed.

33:39.488 --> 33:42.324
Guaranteed for what?

33:42.366 --> 33:44.660
Big match coming up,
Mr. Jones, Mr. Hagen.

33:44.702 --> 33:47.913
Fella gonna be needing a caddy.

33:47.955 --> 33:49.248
You're a caddy?

33:49.289 --> 33:53.377
Well, that depends. You're a golfer?

33:55.838 --> 33:59.258
I don't need a caddy.
I'm not playing.

33:59.299 --> 34:02.177
I don't play anymore at all.

34:02.219 --> 34:04.429
Oh. Well, thank you, sir.

34:04.471 --> 34:06.264
I take you up on that food
you offered.

34:06.306 --> 34:09.935
- All right.
- Evening, sir.

34:10.976 --> 34:13.396
Don't make no sense is all.

34:13.438 --> 34:16.065
Man say he don't play,
yet he out here...

34:16.107 --> 34:19.610
...this shade of night hitting
balls where he can't see them.

34:19.652 --> 34:23.531
I've done things that have
made less sense.

34:23.572 --> 34:26.743
As we all have.

34:26.784 --> 34:30.455
For $5 guaranteed,
I'm offering you my caddy services.

34:30.496 --> 34:33.875
For $5? You know the winner
gets $ 10,000...

34:33.916 --> 34:37.128
...the caddy's cut is 10 percent,
so that's $ 1000.

34:37.168 --> 34:40.130
- I take $5 guaranteed.
- You don't want $ 1000?

34:40.172 --> 34:41.757
You said you ain't even playing...

34:41.799 --> 34:46.137
...and Lord knows how awful
you gonna look if you do.

34:46.178 --> 34:50.683
So $5 sound pretty
good from where I'm sitting.

34:52.268 --> 34:55.353
Rhythm of the game
like the rhythm of life.

34:55.396 --> 34:57.648
Here.

34:57.689 --> 34:59.942
- Here.
- Oh, no, sir, I don't--

34:59.983 --> 35:02.277
Go on.

35:02.319 --> 35:06.239
- Go ahead.
- Well, thank you, sir.

35:10.994 --> 35:12.621
You know, some folks say...

35:12.662 --> 35:15.665
...put the ball in the front
of your stance.

35:15.707 --> 35:17.125
Others say you should--

35:17.167 --> 35:21.004
You gonna hit the ball
or dance with it?

35:21.046 --> 35:23.590
I'm kind of partial to dancing.
Me and this gal--

35:23.631 --> 35:26.759
Hit the ball.

35:36.018 --> 35:40.439
- So, you're a golfer.
- No. I don't play golf.

35:41.357 --> 35:44.860
Give me the damn club.

35:45.861 --> 35:49.990
See, the trick is to find your swing.

35:51.408 --> 35:53.619
What did you say?

35:53.661 --> 35:57.957
You lost your swing.
We got to go find it.

35:59.416 --> 36:03.962
Now somewhere in the harmony
of all that is...

36:05.964 --> 36:07.507
...ugh...

36:07.549 --> 36:11.053
...all that was...

36:14.056 --> 36:17.559
...all that will be.

36:22.230 --> 36:27.485
I ain't seen a man hit like that since
the North-South Championship in 1916.

36:27.527 --> 36:32.073
They stopped play for 20 minutes
to measure how far it went.

36:32.115 --> 36:35.618
Bagger Vance the name.

36:38.037 --> 36:41.249
Hit a few more.

36:42.125 --> 36:46.254
<i>And that, they say, is how
Bagger Vance became Junuh's caddy.</i>

36:46.295 --> 36:48.172
Oh yeah, give me one more like that.

36:48.214 --> 36:51.592
Just like that one there.

36:51.634 --> 36:55.596
I'm telling you the truth,
Wilbur Charles.

36:55.638 --> 36:58.140
She was down to her panties
and brassiere.

36:58.182 --> 37:00.351
And you were in the room watching?

37:00.392 --> 37:01.852
You think we're so stupid...

37:01.894 --> 37:03.729
...we'd believe Miss Adele...

37:03.771 --> 37:06.106
...get down to her skivvies
with you in the room?

37:06.148 --> 37:08.400
It's the God's honest truth, Eugene.

37:08.442 --> 37:13.572
Scalp me, shrink my head and roast it
if that ain't exactly what happened.

37:13.614 --> 37:16.408
She thought I was asleep
the whole time.

37:16.450 --> 37:21.163
- That ain't all. Junuh's gonna play.
- He said that?

37:21.204 --> 37:24.583
Not in so many words, but--

37:24.624 --> 37:26.251
Look over there!

37:26.293 --> 37:29.671
Ain't that Miss Adele now,
across the street?

37:29.713 --> 37:31.339
She went into Louder's Notions.

37:31.381 --> 37:36.177
I could swear it's her.
I'd know that figure anywhere.

37:40.139 --> 37:43.976
Well, as far as Junuh is concerned,
I guess that's about it.

37:44.018 --> 37:48.314
If we don't have someone from
Savannah, I won't support this match.

37:48.356 --> 37:51.651
- There must be plenty--
- All right!

37:51.692 --> 37:54.904
I'll play in your damn golf match.

37:54.945 --> 37:59.200
I should've let you finish.
Now I got nothing to show for it.

37:59.241 --> 38:02.995
For the life of me, I have no idea
what you're referring to.

38:03.037 --> 38:07.166
- I can explain it to them--
- I don't think that's necessary!

38:07.207 --> 38:10.586
God bless Savannah.

38:16.133 --> 38:21.763
<i>The day Jones and Hagen arrived
in Savannah was declared a holiday.</i>

38:41.366 --> 38:44.619
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the first....

38:44.661 --> 38:48.581
That's O.B. Keeler. He writes
for the Atlanta Journal.

38:48.623 --> 38:51.292
He goes wherever Bobby Jones goes.

38:51.334 --> 38:54.337
And that's Walter Hagen's man,
Spec Hammond.

38:54.378 --> 38:58.549
They say Hagen won't play without him.

38:58.758 --> 39:03.429
That's Grantland Rice, the most
powerful sports writer in the country.

39:03.471 --> 39:08.475
He's staying at our boarding house,
because he's nobody's man.

39:10.853 --> 39:15.315
Mr. Robert Tyra Jones Jr.
of Atlanta, Georgia.

39:23.282 --> 39:26.368
Mr. Jones has won 13 national
championships...

39:26.410 --> 39:31.164
...including four U.S. Opens
and five U.S. Amateurs.

39:31.206 --> 39:36.211
He has also won all three
British Opens in which he has played.

39:36.252 --> 39:41.341
For the first time in history,
last year, won the Grand Slam.

39:41.591 --> 39:46.262
All four major golf championships
in a single year.

39:50.141 --> 39:53.519
But what is not well known,
at the very same time...

39:53.561 --> 39:55.313
...he won his championships...

39:55.354 --> 39:58.149
...Mr. Jones earned a degree
in Engineering...

39:58.191 --> 40:01.861
...from Georgia Tech. A degree
in English from Harvard...

40:01.902 --> 40:03.529
...and a law degree...

40:03.571 --> 40:08.617
...from Emory University
in Georgia, all with distinction.

40:13.622 --> 40:16.917
Mr. Walter Hagen.

40:20.587 --> 40:24.925
Mr. Hagen has won 11 national
championships, including...

40:24.967 --> 40:28.762
...four British Opens and five PGAs.

40:28.804 --> 40:30.472
And in one stretch...

40:30.514 --> 40:35.477
...Mr. Hagen won 22 straight
professional championships.

40:37.354 --> 40:40.357
Nice work!

40:41.024 --> 40:44.402
Mr. Rannulph Junuh.

40:53.870 --> 40:57.957
Walter, I think we're the underdogs.

41:00.251 --> 41:04.297
Born and bred in Savannah, Georgia!

41:13.264 --> 41:17.601
Mr. Junuh won the Georgia Amateur
at the age of 16, making him...

41:17.643 --> 41:19.895
...the youngest man to ever do so.

41:19.937 --> 41:22.356
And until he left for the war
was considered...

41:22.398 --> 41:25.109
...the South's premier golfer.

41:25.150 --> 41:28.779
Mr. Junuh returned
from the war a hero...

41:28.820 --> 41:31.448
...decorated with
the medal of honor...

41:31.490 --> 41:35.660
...for surviving a deadly mission
in which...

41:35.702 --> 41:38.747
...most--

41:43.460 --> 41:47.589
The rest of his company
were tragically defeated.

41:47.630 --> 41:52.218
Makes you think twice about
stepping on his ball.

41:52.260 --> 41:55.263
Mr. Hagen!

41:58.099 --> 42:00.143
Ladies and gentlemen...

42:00.184 --> 42:05.439
...Bobby Jones, Walter Hagen,
and our very own, Rannulph Junuh!

42:14.532 --> 42:18.994
On behalf of the great city
of Savannah....

42:22.998 --> 42:26.710
Sure is some storm brewing.

42:28.253 --> 42:32.049
- So where're you off to?
- However far it takes.

42:32.090 --> 42:34.551
You don't expect me to stay
around here, do you?

42:34.593 --> 42:39.681
Not me. I consider it a great miracle
you was even there at all today.

42:39.723 --> 42:43.101
Let me help you with these things.

42:43.143 --> 42:48.481
You heard Adele. Jones never finished
lower than second in any tournament.

42:48.523 --> 42:52.027
I believe she said he finished
lower than second once.

42:52.068 --> 42:54.946
Must have been the week
he took his law exams.

42:54.988 --> 42:58.533
Yeah, I believe it was.

43:00.577 --> 43:03.329
Will you be needing these shoes,
Mr. Junuh?

43:03.371 --> 43:05.206
Look like they're just my size.

43:05.248 --> 43:09.252
- Keep them.
- Thank you kindly, sir.

43:16.384 --> 43:20.471
Sure is some storm heading this way.

43:26.727 --> 43:29.813
It's a pleasure to welcome you
to our home.

43:29.855 --> 43:32.524
It's a pleasure to be here, ma'am.
Thank you.

43:32.566 --> 43:36.403
Hardy, take his belongings to his
room, then I got chores for you.

43:36.445 --> 43:37.696
Yes'm.

43:37.738 --> 43:42.743
Expect this is the most exciting
sports event ever, ain't it, Mr. Rice?

43:42.784 --> 43:44.619
- Why is that, son?
- Why?

43:44.661 --> 43:47.706
Because of Jones and Hagen.
They's out for blood.

43:47.747 --> 43:52.419
Oh, I didn't come for Jones or Hagen.
I came for Rannulph Junuh.

43:52.460 --> 43:56.214
You come all the way down
from New York City to see Junuh?

43:56.256 --> 43:58.049
Uh-huh.

43:58.091 --> 44:01.803
I saw Junuh play once,
then he disappeared.

44:01.845 --> 44:06.933
I'd love to see him play,
especially against Jones and Hagen.

44:08.768 --> 44:10.937
Go get them, Junuh! Go get them!

44:10.978 --> 44:15.858
God bless you, Junuh!
Show them what Savannah's made of!

44:16.067 --> 44:20.154
- Go get them, Junuh!
- Give them hell!

44:21.364 --> 44:24.116
Give them hell.

44:24.158 --> 44:27.620
Junuh, make us proud!

44:42.009 --> 44:44.803
Damn.

45:48.615 --> 45:53.161
I take that you was interested
in being Mr. Junuh's fore caddy.

45:53.203 --> 45:55.622
- No.
- No?

45:55.664 --> 45:58.083
- No.
- No?

45:58.125 --> 46:03.546
Well, maybe I was. But I guess I just
ain't got the nerve to ask you yet.

46:03.588 --> 46:06.675
I ain't got time till you does,
so here's what I propose...

46:06.716 --> 46:10.094
...I'll assume that the moment you
gets the nerve to ask...

46:10.136 --> 46:13.640
...will be the same moment I decide
I tell you, "Yeah."

46:13.681 --> 46:15.934
How'd that suit you?

46:15.975 --> 46:20.730
- That suits me just fine, sir.
- Folks call me Bagger.

46:23.524 --> 46:25.151
Yes, sir, Bagger, sir.

46:25.193 --> 46:28.321
Soon as you're through
cleaning Mr. Junuh's shoes...

46:28.362 --> 46:32.491
...we'll measure out on the course.

46:51.093 --> 46:55.430
<i>Junuh knew that if he were to
have any chance in the tournament...</i>

46:55.472 --> 47:00.393
<i>... he had no choice but to come
to terms with his demons.</i>

47:01.937 --> 47:04.189
<i>The only question in his mind was...</i>

47:04.231 --> 47:07.275
<i>... which demon gave him
the most aggravation:</i>

47:07.317 --> 47:11.488
<i>Bagger Vance
or Miss Adele Invergordon?</i>

47:11.571 --> 47:13.323
Mr. Jones?

47:13.364 --> 47:16.910
Could you hold, please?

47:18.620 --> 47:23.124
- Thank you very much, Mr. Jones.
- Thank you.

47:23.166 --> 47:25.668
Oh, Mr. Hagen.

47:25.710 --> 47:29.589
How are you this evening?

47:32.717 --> 47:35.928
Good time, now.

47:38.848 --> 47:43.727
<i>Very nice.
Thank you very much, Mr. Hagen.</i>

47:49.983 --> 47:53.112
Make sure you keep this area clear.

47:53.153 --> 47:56.782
Dance and a picture, sir?

47:57.699 --> 48:01.119
Thank you very much.

48:01.703 --> 48:04.623
That's it. Very nice.
Look right over here.

48:04.664 --> 48:08.001
Right here. Big smile.
Don't stop, stay together.

48:08.043 --> 48:09.669
Just pretend there's music.

48:09.711 --> 48:14.382
Keep going, keep going!
Look right over here. Okay.

48:16.676 --> 48:19.929
Give me a smile.

48:20.555 --> 48:23.975
Thank you very much.

48:27.812 --> 48:31.816
- May I have this dance?
- Of course.

48:39.031 --> 48:40.616
Longer.

48:40.658 --> 48:43.202
Little shorter.

48:43.244 --> 48:45.454
How's that?

48:45.496 --> 48:47.665
Good. One stride equals a yard.

48:47.706 --> 48:50.125
Go on over to the tee
and start counting.

48:50.167 --> 48:53.629
<i>Top golfers try to get
a leg up on the competition...</i>

48:53.671 --> 48:56.757
<i>... by having the men they trust
sneak on the course...</i>

48:56.799 --> 48:58.675
<i>... and do their own measurements.</i>

48:58.717 --> 49:02.971
<i>So Bagger and I walked the course
that night, measuring away.</i>

49:03.013 --> 49:08.143
<i>Bagger never wrote down a number.
He filed it all in his head.</i>

49:11.188 --> 49:14.774
Hit one a little harder.

49:17.444 --> 49:20.905
Go and do that again.

49:21.990 --> 49:27.120
Right here is where this game is won.
Right here on the green.

49:27.453 --> 49:29.330
First you got to see it.

49:29.372 --> 49:32.542
Sun gonna be there in the morning.

49:32.583 --> 49:34.544
Over there in the afternoon.

49:34.585 --> 49:39.507
Funny thing is, the blades of grass
gonna follow the sun.

49:43.302 --> 49:46.389
The grain is gonna shift.

49:46.430 --> 49:48.516
That same putt...

49:48.557 --> 49:53.562
...gonna go one way in the morning,
the other in the afternoon.

49:53.604 --> 49:58.734
One way in the morning, the other
in the afternoon. You see that?

49:58.776 --> 50:03.405
A golf course put folk through
quite a punishment.

50:03.447 --> 50:07.075
It lives and breathes just like us.

50:07.117 --> 50:09.828
You think Junuh can win?

50:09.870 --> 50:13.540
Yeah, if he can find
his authentic swing.

50:13.582 --> 50:16.751
"Authentic"?

50:17.627 --> 50:21.339
Go and hit one more for me.

50:24.843 --> 50:30.014
Yep, inside each and every one of us
is one true, authentic swing.

50:30.056 --> 50:32.809
Something we was born with
that's ours...

50:32.850 --> 50:36.979
...and ours alone. Something can't
be taught to you or learned.

50:37.021 --> 50:39.941
Something that got to be remembered.

50:39.982 --> 50:43.194
Over time, the world can rob us
of that swing...

50:43.236 --> 50:47.198
...and get buried inside us under...

50:47.239 --> 50:51.077
...all our woulda's and coulda's,
and shoulda's.

50:51.118 --> 50:55.664
Some folk even forget what
their swing was like.

50:55.706 --> 51:00.252
Some folk even forget what
their swing was like.

51:00.794 --> 51:04.923
- You keep swinging.
- But I don't have any balls.

51:04.965 --> 51:08.135
Don't worry about the ball
or where it's gonna go....

51:08.177 --> 51:11.221
Just swing the club.

51:11.263 --> 51:14.433
Close your eyes.

51:14.474 --> 51:17.519
- Close my--
- You can't make that ball go in.

51:17.561 --> 51:20.313
You have to let it.

51:20.355 --> 51:24.401
Feel the club.
Feel the weight of the club.

51:24.442 --> 51:28.279
A deep perfect line.
Dropping in, soft as butter.

51:28.321 --> 51:32.283
Listen to the sounds of the night.
Keep swinging that club.

51:32.325 --> 51:34.077
Feel the breeze coming off the sea.

51:34.118 --> 51:38.831
Inside every one of us is
one true, authentic swing.

51:39.040 --> 51:40.500
Keep swinging that club...

51:40.541 --> 51:44.253
...until you're part
of the whole thing.

51:44.295 --> 51:46.339
Something we was born with.

51:46.380 --> 51:51.177
- That's good. Listen to the night.
- I don't feel a thing.

51:51.218 --> 51:55.848
Just keep swinging that club until
you're part of the whole thing.

51:55.890 --> 51:58.642
That's a good thing.

51:58.684 --> 52:01.896
Can you see it?

52:13.824 --> 52:17.577
- All right, time to go.
- Why?

52:28.088 --> 52:32.133
<i>They say that God is happiest
when His children are at play.</i>

52:32.175 --> 52:35.437
<i>Well, it certainly seemed God
was in fine spirits...</i>

52:35.478 --> 52:39.807
<i>... when the day of the match dawned.</i>

52:42.602 --> 52:44.604
<i>People came from far and wide.</i>

52:44.646 --> 52:47.565
<i>There wasn't a room to be found
in a boarding house...</i>

52:47.607 --> 52:49.692
<i>... or the Krewe Island Hotel.</i>

52:49.734 --> 52:52.987
<i>The match was designed
as the ultimate championship.</i>

52:53.029 --> 52:54.864
<i>Thirty-six holes on Saturday...</i>

52:54.906 --> 52:59.577
<i>... followed by another grueling
36 holes on Sunday.</i>

53:21.473 --> 53:25.477
- Where's Hagen?
- Oh, he'll be here.

53:55.548 --> 53:58.092
Hello, Mr. Junuh. Bob, how are you?

53:58.134 --> 54:01.554
They do put on a splendid
show, don't they?

54:01.595 --> 54:04.140
Later, they'll even
hit some golf balls.

54:04.181 --> 54:07.518
Ladies and gentlemen.

54:07.560 --> 54:10.229
By virtue of the draw...

54:10.271 --> 54:13.440
...Mr. Jones will hit first...

54:13.482 --> 54:16.151
...Mr. Hagen second...

54:16.193 --> 54:19.780
...and then Mr. Junuh.

54:40.550 --> 54:42.600
<i>And then suddenly,
in that moment...</i>

54:42.615 --> 54:46.181
<i>I felt as if I could hear the earth
breathing beneath me.</i>

55:39.065 --> 55:44.321
<i>Junuh hit a good opening drive,
and I was sure he was on his way.</i>

55:55.331 --> 56:00.712
<i>It's hard to imagine three more different
approaches to the game of golf.</i>

56:00.878 --> 56:04.924
<i>Bobby Jones' swing was a study
of grace in motion.</i>

56:04.966 --> 56:08.886
<i>He had a way of making
the difficult shots look easy...</i>

56:08.928 --> 56:13.099
<i>... and the easy shots
look even easier.</i>

56:18.687 --> 56:20.105
<i>Hagen, on the other hand...</i>

56:20.147 --> 56:25.694
<i>... hit more bad shots in a single
game than most golfers do in a season.</i>

56:26.653 --> 56:30.908
<i>But Hagen had long ago
learned one thing:</i>

56:31.867 --> 56:36.913
<i>Three lousy shots and
one brilliant shot can still make par.</i>

56:40.375 --> 56:42.836
<i>And Junuh? Well, even now...</i>

56:42.878 --> 56:47.090
<i>... I can't think of it
without wincing.</i>

56:51.636 --> 56:55.056
- Beach.
- Go ball, go!

56:57.475 --> 56:58.726
Yep. Beach.

56:58.768 --> 57:01.104
He missed it.

57:01.145 --> 57:03.773
We sure got lovely weather
for it, though.

57:03.815 --> 57:07.652
Let me get that from you, sir.

57:19.663 --> 57:22.166
Any ideas?

57:22.208 --> 57:25.252
About what?

57:26.670 --> 57:30.299
Could you give me a club?

57:36.471 --> 57:39.808
That's a good one.

57:47.315 --> 57:51.444
What the hell is wrong with his grip?

58:04.749 --> 58:07.960
By the end of five holes,
Junuh was five strokes behind...

58:08.002 --> 58:11.589
...with 67 holes to go.

58:11.964 --> 58:17.762
Things would've been much worse if it
weren't for Junuh's shot on the sixth.

58:27.313 --> 58:31.066
It was a birdie.
One stroke under par for the hole...

58:31.108 --> 58:33.610
...moving him to four
behind Jones and Hagen...

58:33.652 --> 58:36.905
...and his only hope
for the entire round.

58:36.947 --> 58:38.657
I think I've found my game.

58:38.699 --> 58:43.495
Good news. Now we got to figure
out what that game is.

58:45.247 --> 58:48.291
By the 18th tee, at the close
of the morning round...

58:48.333 --> 58:52.462
...Jones and Hagen
were neck and neck.

58:59.344 --> 59:01.721
And as for Junuh....

59:01.763 --> 59:03.807
This is becoming embarrassing.

59:03.848 --> 59:08.895
Oh, no, sir. It's been embarrassing
for quite some time now.

59:30.499 --> 59:33.669
Can I make a suggestion to you?

59:33.711 --> 59:35.254
What now?

59:35.296 --> 59:38.549
Why don't you hook it out of bounds?

59:38.590 --> 59:42.010
Carve it out over them pretty trees
into the ocean.

59:42.052 --> 59:44.054
Really, do what you've been doing.

59:44.096 --> 59:46.682
Then, you'll be so far
out the match...

59:46.723 --> 59:50.602
...me and you can relax
and enjoy ourselves.

59:50.644 --> 59:53.438
Yeah.

01:00:00.278 --> 01:00:02.238
What you waiting for? Go on.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:06.743
Hook it to hell.
Put yourself out your misery.

01:00:48.951 --> 01:00:52.246
You want to quit?

01:00:52.329 --> 01:00:56.416
You can creep off somewhere,
I'll tell folk you took sick.

01:00:56.458 --> 01:00:58.919
Truth be told,
ain't nobody gonna object.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:02.923
Fact, they probably be happy as bugs
in a bake shop see you pack up.

01:01:02.964 --> 01:01:06.259
You know I can't quit.

01:01:06.301 --> 01:01:08.136
I know.

01:01:08.178 --> 01:01:12.140
Just making sure you know it too.

01:01:26.529 --> 01:01:29.824
I can't stand it!

01:01:33.369 --> 01:01:36.914
Man alive! The fairway!

01:01:48.592 --> 01:01:51.720
Hello, Bagger.
Hello, Mr. Bagger Vance!

01:01:51.762 --> 01:01:56.600
I want a good explanation. What in
God's green earth are you telling him?

01:01:56.642 --> 01:02:00.854
I'd be appreciative if we talk
about this later. Right now I'm busy.

01:02:00.896 --> 01:02:02.981
You have done a hell of a job so far.

01:02:03.023 --> 01:02:07.861
Let me talk to him. Mr. Vance, what
the judge is trying to determine is...

01:02:07.903 --> 01:02:12.198
...your strategy for helping poor
Mr. Junuh find his game, because...

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:17.203
...you seem to know as much about
caddying as I do driving a locomotive.

01:02:17.245 --> 01:02:19.539
You all want to know my strategy?

01:02:19.581 --> 01:02:22.166
Right now my player
is a little confused.

01:02:22.208 --> 01:02:25.169
See, he still think he Rannulph Junuh.

01:02:25.211 --> 01:02:28.172
He is Rannulph Junuh, you damn twit!

01:02:28.214 --> 01:02:31.843
Well, he is and he ain't.

01:02:47.233 --> 01:02:50.235
Thank you.

01:03:18.888 --> 01:03:23.351
Anybody drinking?
Here, I'm gonna get a drink.

01:03:45.414 --> 01:03:48.459
It'll come.

01:04:05.642 --> 01:04:08.353
I had me a uncle named Rufus.

01:04:08.395 --> 01:04:11.982
- Stupid.
- Lost his right arm in a cotton gin.

01:04:12.023 --> 01:04:14.609
Learned how to do everything
with his left arm.

01:04:14.651 --> 01:04:19.990
He was changing the wheel on a wagon.
Axle chopped of his left arm.

01:04:20.031 --> 01:04:21.574
So he did everything with...

01:04:21.616 --> 01:04:22.992
- ...his teeth.
- Was a mistake.

01:04:23.034 --> 01:04:25.703
He said things to Mr. Johnny
he shouldn't.

01:04:25.745 --> 01:04:28.206
Mr. Johnny knocked out his teeth.

01:04:28.248 --> 01:04:29.541
"Savannah's own."

01:04:29.582 --> 01:04:33.336
He learned how to do
everything with his feet.

01:04:33.378 --> 01:04:36.631
Until he got this fungus.
It grew all up the--

01:04:36.672 --> 01:04:40.009
- Stop it!
- It's about overcoming adversity.

01:04:40.051 --> 01:04:43.095
Listen, you want to talk to me
about my grip, fine.

01:04:43.137 --> 01:04:44.889
Talk about my swing, fine.

01:04:44.931 --> 01:04:47.433
Don't want to hear about fungus?

01:04:47.475 --> 01:04:48.934
He became a dancer.

01:04:48.976 --> 01:04:52.396
He made a fortune. Was the most
amazing thing to see...

01:04:52.438 --> 01:04:56.275
...this armless, toothless man
sliding across the stage...

01:04:56.317 --> 01:05:00.362
...to the music of Bessie Smith
and the Duke.

01:05:00.404 --> 01:05:04.742
I don't care if I'm 12 strokes back.
I just don't.

01:05:04.783 --> 01:05:06.493
You don't even want to win?

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:08.078
It's just a game, Bagger.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:12.541
Yes, sir. You said it yourself now.
"Just a game."

01:05:12.582 --> 01:05:16.628
So maybe there's something else
that's riling you.

01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:20.131
Maybe you thought you'd just
sashay onto that green...

01:05:20.173 --> 01:05:24.761
...and the old hero of Savannah
just reappear all by itself.

01:05:24.803 --> 01:05:27.180
Don't work that way, is all.

01:05:27.222 --> 01:05:28.723
The Junuh you was...

01:05:28.765 --> 01:05:31.142
...you ain't never gonna be again.

01:05:31.184 --> 01:05:34.938
Ever. That's all I'm saying.

01:05:35.855 --> 01:05:37.774
You don't know a thing about me.

01:05:37.815 --> 01:05:41.027
I know you'll look pretty foolish
out there with...

01:05:41.069 --> 01:05:45.198
- ...two different shoes on your feet.
- Oh, Jesus.

01:05:45.239 --> 01:05:48.284
You got an answer for everything,
don't you, Bagger.

01:05:48.326 --> 01:05:50.786
Let me tell you.
There's no difference...

01:05:50.828 --> 01:05:55.374
...between winning and losing,
and anything in between.

01:05:55.416 --> 01:05:56.625
What's lost is lost.

01:05:56.667 --> 01:05:59.670
A man lives, a man dies.

01:05:59.712 --> 01:06:03.132
In the end it all turns out the same.
You're alone.

01:06:03.173 --> 01:06:05.259
And that's all you'll ever be.

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:08.637
That a fact? Alone?

01:06:08.679 --> 01:06:12.057
So a soul is born with everything
the Lord give it...

01:06:12.099 --> 01:06:16.144
...things don't go it's way,
so it gives up, and the Lord takes...

01:06:16.186 --> 01:06:17.521
- ...everything back?
- Right.

01:06:17.562 --> 01:06:21.358
And then the soul dies alone.

01:06:21.483 --> 01:06:23.985
That pretty much what you said?

01:06:24.027 --> 01:06:28.490
- That's right.
- That's a sad story, Mr. Junuh.

01:06:28.615 --> 01:06:33.203
- Yes, it is.
- That's the dumbest thing I heard...

01:06:33.244 --> 01:06:36.831
...any fool say. Ever.

01:06:37.790 --> 01:06:40.585
You got yourself
a hard eye there, Mr. Junuh.

01:06:40.627 --> 01:06:44.839
Soul is born with everything,
then it dies, and the good Lord--

01:06:44.881 --> 01:06:48.176
You a funny man, Mr. Junuh!

01:06:48.217 --> 01:06:52.138
So, what I hear, Bob's waiting
to make his move.

01:06:52.179 --> 01:06:54.015
Doesn't want to peak early.

01:06:54.056 --> 01:06:58.811
You think Walter doesn't know?
He's keeping pace with Bobby.

01:06:58.853 --> 01:07:01.230
When Bobby kicks his game into gear...

01:07:01.272 --> 01:07:03.983
...he's in for a big surprise.

01:07:04.024 --> 01:07:06.860
What about Junuh?

01:07:06.902 --> 01:07:08.904
What about him, son?

01:07:08.946 --> 01:07:12.783
There's still three rounds to go.
That's 54 holes.

01:07:12.825 --> 01:07:17.663
All he's got to do is pick up one
stroke every four holes and he wins!

01:07:17.704 --> 01:07:18.914
It's possible!

01:07:18.956 --> 01:07:21.917
It's possible, son,
but not very likely.

01:07:21.959 --> 01:07:25.796
Junuh has shown no signs of
getting his game together.

01:07:25.837 --> 01:07:28.632
He's playing Bobby Jones
and Walter Hagen.

01:07:28.673 --> 01:07:31.676
What do you know?
You can't even get a decent job!

01:07:31.718 --> 01:07:35.096
Hardy! Hardy Greaves,
come back here!

01:07:35.138 --> 01:07:38.641
Let him go, Ida.

01:07:39.809 --> 01:07:43.605
Been a hard time for the boy.

01:07:52.864 --> 01:07:56.993
There something you wanted
to tell me?

01:07:59.036 --> 01:08:03.666
Well, I'm trying to think of
how to say it, Junuh.

01:08:04.625 --> 01:08:07.753
There is a purpose to this visit...

01:08:07.795 --> 01:08:10.923
...and that's to apologize.

01:08:10.965 --> 01:08:16.511
I'm not an apologetic woman, it takes
me longer to organize my thoughts.

01:08:16.553 --> 01:08:21.475
I want to seem properly contrite for
having gotten you into this match...

01:08:21.517 --> 01:08:25.479
...but not seem what I did was
ill-intentioned, since it wasn't.

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:29.649
What exactly are you apologizing for?

01:08:31.609 --> 01:08:35.404
For publicly humiliating you.

01:08:36.031 --> 01:08:38.575
That'd be a good thing
to apologize for.

01:08:38.617 --> 01:08:42.370
However, I think that....

01:08:43.328 --> 01:08:47.500
Basically, what I'm trying
to say is...

01:08:47.542 --> 01:08:49.669
...that I'm sorry.

01:08:49.711 --> 01:08:52.839
But it's not my fault.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:56.466
You're the one to blame.

01:08:57.926 --> 01:09:01.013
That's one hell of an apology, Adele.

01:09:01.055 --> 01:09:05.393
I'd stop the tournament in a flash,
if I could. I truly, truly would.

01:09:05.434 --> 01:09:07.978
Because I know it's
just gonna get worse.

01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:10.439
The way you're playing,
you're destroying...

01:09:10.481 --> 01:09:13.234
...any chance Jones and Hagen
have of doing well.

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:17.904
And your supporters? Every man,
woman and child in Savannah...

01:09:17.946 --> 01:09:23.368
...are so demoralized that they
can barely hold down their lunches.

01:09:27.038 --> 01:09:30.917
So, you want my apology or not?

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:33.754
No.

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:38.008
Well....

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:43.263
That's the Junuh I know.
Just full of little surprises.

01:09:43.305 --> 01:09:45.974
What was it, Adele?

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:49.727
What did you like about us?

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:56.276
I liked the way we danced.

01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:05.701
What's your problem?

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:11.082
And they looked at me like
I was stupid or crazy, or something.

01:10:11.123 --> 01:10:15.461
I told them you could beat Jones
and Hagen, being 12 strokes behind.

01:10:15.503 --> 01:10:19.215
I told them, all you had to do
was pick up one stroke...

01:10:19.256 --> 01:10:23.177
...every four holes of the next
54 holes, right?

01:10:23.218 --> 01:10:24.303
Yeah, right.

01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:27.139
Who do you think was telling me
you were hopeless?

01:10:27.181 --> 01:10:30.934
My own father, who says he was
a good friend of yours...

01:10:30.976 --> 01:10:34.438
- ...till you lost your mind in the war.
- He's right.

01:10:34.479 --> 01:10:37.649
You can't win?

01:10:37.774 --> 01:10:41.570
He was a good friend of mine.

01:10:46.908 --> 01:10:49.035
He's sweeping streets, Junuh.

01:10:49.077 --> 01:10:52.831
In the middle of Savannah,
where everybody can see him.

01:10:52.872 --> 01:10:56.125
Me, my friends and everybody.

01:10:56.167 --> 01:10:59.629
You feeling sorry because
your daddy sweeps streets?

01:10:59.671 --> 01:11:04.509
He ain't the only man who can't
get work. Wilbur's dad can't neither.

01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:10.014
But he says he'd rather do nothing
than something beneath his dignity.

01:11:10.932 --> 01:11:13.434
Grow up, Hardy.

01:11:13.476 --> 01:11:16.145
It ain't time for me to grow up.

01:11:16.187 --> 01:11:19.732
Your dad's sweeping because
he took every dime he had...

01:11:19.774 --> 01:11:23.694
...and used it to pay
every man and woman he owed...

01:11:23.736 --> 01:11:29.283
...instead of declaring bankruptcy
like everyone, including Wilbur's dad.

01:11:29.324 --> 01:11:33.912
Which is why he's able to sit
all day on his "dignity."

01:11:33.954 --> 01:11:39.501
Your daddy stared adversity in the eye
and he beat it back with a broom.

01:11:55.016 --> 01:11:59.145
You really love this game, don't you?

01:11:59.687 --> 01:12:02.732
The greatest game there is.

01:12:02.774 --> 01:12:04.901
You really think so?

01:12:04.943 --> 01:12:08.363
Ask anybody. It's fun, it's hard...

01:12:08.404 --> 01:12:12.575
...and you stand on the green grass,
and it's just you and the ball.

01:12:12.617 --> 01:12:15.745
There ain't nobody
to beat up on but yourself.

01:12:15.786 --> 01:12:21.167
Just like Mr. Nunan keeps hitting
himself with the club when he's angry.

01:12:21.208 --> 01:12:25.296
He's broken his toe three times
on account of it.

01:12:25.337 --> 01:12:28.549
It's the only game you can
call penalty on yourself.

01:12:28.591 --> 01:12:31.427
If you're honest,
which most people are.

01:12:31.468 --> 01:12:35.639
There just ain't
no other game like it.

01:12:39.893 --> 01:12:43.355
You better get going.

01:12:54.115 --> 01:12:57.911
In case you didn't see that, Bobby,
I'll show you where it's at...

01:12:57.952 --> 01:13:02.082
...when your shot catches up to it.

01:13:10.965 --> 01:13:15.344
Oh, yes, greatest game there is.
Right, Hardy?

01:13:15.386 --> 01:13:18.514
- Yes sir.
- The greatest game there will ever be.

01:13:18.556 --> 01:13:23.019
- Just you and the ball.
- All by your lonesome.

01:13:23.644 --> 01:13:25.855
I think it's time.

01:13:25.896 --> 01:13:29.525
- Time for what?
- Time for you to see the field.

01:13:29.567 --> 01:13:31.277
The field?

01:13:31.318 --> 01:13:36.532
I see it, 445 yards long, it's got
a little red flag at the end...

01:13:36.573 --> 01:13:38.867
...it's 12 strokes ahead.

01:13:38.909 --> 01:13:41.537
That ain't it.

01:13:41.578 --> 01:13:45.123
If you had, you wouldn't
be hacking at that ball...

01:13:45.165 --> 01:13:47.209
...like you was chopping weeds.

01:13:47.251 --> 01:13:50.629
Just give me the club.

01:13:50.671 --> 01:13:54.966
Sorry I bring it up.
Take that, hack away.

01:14:01.181 --> 01:14:04.726
Here, Billy, over here!

01:14:10.356 --> 01:14:14.277
All right, what's the "field"?

01:14:14.527 --> 01:14:18.322
Fix your eyes on Bobby Jones.

01:14:19.449 --> 01:14:23.077
- He's a piece of work.
- Give the man room.

01:14:23.119 --> 01:14:27.039
Knock it out there, Bobby.

01:14:45.224 --> 01:14:48.519
Look at his practice swing.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:52.814
Almost like he's searching
for something.

01:14:52.898 --> 01:14:55.776
Then he finds it.

01:14:55.817 --> 01:15:00.489
Watch how he settle this up,
right into the middle.

01:15:01.907 --> 01:15:05.160
Feel that focus.

01:15:06.745 --> 01:15:09.956
He's got a lot of shots to choose from.

01:15:09.998 --> 01:15:13.668
Duffs and tops and skulls.

01:15:15.587 --> 01:15:20.466
There's only one shot that's
in perfect harmony with the field.

01:15:20.508 --> 01:15:22.969
One shot that's his...

01:15:23.010 --> 01:15:26.430
...authentic shot.

01:15:27.265 --> 01:15:31.102
That shot is gonna choose him.

01:15:32.019 --> 01:15:35.398
There's a perfect shot trying
to find every one of us.

01:15:35.439 --> 01:15:39.568
All we got to do is get ourselves
out of its way...

01:15:39.610 --> 01:15:43.280
...and let it choose us.

01:15:44.531 --> 01:15:48.327
Look at him, he in the field.

01:15:57.711 --> 01:16:01.923
You can't see that flag
as some dragon you got to slay.

01:16:01.965 --> 01:16:04.759
You've got to look with soft eyes.

01:16:04.801 --> 01:16:08.680
See the place where the tides,
and the seasons...

01:16:08.722 --> 01:16:10.765
...the turning of the earth...

01:16:10.807 --> 01:16:13.685
...all come together.

01:16:13.727 --> 01:16:16.688
Where everything that is...

01:16:16.729 --> 01:16:20.024
...becomes one.

01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:24.904
You've got to seek that place,
with your soul, Junuh.

01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:42.213
Seek it with your hands,
don't think about it, feel it.

01:16:42.254 --> 01:16:46.967
Your hands are wiser than
your head's ever gonna be.

01:16:47.509 --> 01:16:50.721
I can't take you there...

01:16:50.763 --> 01:16:55.058
...just hopes I can help you
find a way.

01:17:02.441 --> 01:17:04.484
It's just you...

01:17:04.526 --> 01:17:06.903
...that ball...

01:17:06.945 --> 01:17:10.323
...that flag...

01:17:11.116 --> 01:17:14.661
...and all you are. Seek it
with your hands, don't think...

01:17:14.703 --> 01:17:16.997
...about it, feel it.

01:17:17.038 --> 01:17:21.000
There's only one shot
that's in harmony with the field.

01:17:21.042 --> 01:17:25.088
The home of your authentic swing.
That flag...

01:17:25.129 --> 01:17:28.716
...and all that you are.

01:18:25.772 --> 01:18:30.401
Even a blind squirrel finds
an acorn now and then.

01:18:40.286 --> 01:18:42.747
<i>The rest of that afternoon is a blur.</i>

01:18:42.788 --> 01:18:46.500
<i>Junuh kept asking question
after question about the field.</i>

01:18:46.542 --> 01:18:49.587
<i>While Bagger acted like nothing much
had happened...</i>

01:18:49.628 --> 01:18:53.340
<i>... and kept making remarks about
how much Hagen's socks must have cost...</i>

01:18:53.382 --> 01:18:58.762
<i>... and how long to dry tobacco leaves
before they make a good smoke.</i>

01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:06.645
<i>But somehow, in the middle of it all,
Junuh started playing golf.</i>

01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:26.956
<i>As the day and second round came to
an end, there was genuine excitement.</i>

01:19:26.998 --> 01:19:30.877
I do so enjoy this little game.

01:19:33.671 --> 01:19:37.884
Why don't you ladies
join me for dinner?

01:19:40.178 --> 01:19:42.221
Hello, Hugh.

01:19:42.263 --> 01:19:44.557
Junuh.

01:19:44.599 --> 01:19:49.770
I'll have a double scotch.
Pretty entertaining out there today.

01:19:49.937 --> 01:19:52.231
That's what the people want.

01:19:52.273 --> 01:19:55.443
Entertainment.

01:19:57.444 --> 01:20:00.155
I got a proposition, Junuh.

01:20:00.197 --> 01:20:03.742
Exhibitions are the thing.
$5-10,000 for two days' work.

01:20:03.784 --> 01:20:06.078
Would you like to go on tour with me?

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:08.580
We'd have good matches, but I'd win.

01:20:08.622 --> 01:20:11.333
Then we'd split the money, 70-30.

01:20:11.375 --> 01:20:14.336
You get the 30.

01:20:14.378 --> 01:20:17.589
I'm not just looking
for another payday here.

01:20:17.631 --> 01:20:20.842
I couldn't breathe without golf.

01:20:20.884 --> 01:20:26.389
I once had the next king of England
hold the pin for me while I putted.

01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:29.100
I did.

01:20:29.142 --> 01:20:32.604
I've paid back everything golf
gave me, many times over.

01:20:32.645 --> 01:20:36.608
But now I'm on the receiving end.

01:20:37.817 --> 01:20:40.194
It's the good life.

01:20:40.236 --> 01:20:43.614
- Why me?
- Crowd likes you.

01:20:43.656 --> 01:20:47.285
I think we have a lot in common,
you and I.

01:20:47.326 --> 01:20:52.373
You've got no illusions that there's
anything worthwhile out there.

01:20:52.415 --> 01:20:56.794
The meaning of it all is
that there is no meaning.

01:20:56.836 --> 01:21:00.840
You'd be good company, that's all.

01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:03.467
Thanks, I'll think it over.

01:21:03.509 --> 01:21:04.718
Hey.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:07.388
I admire the way you're
dealing with this match, Junuh.

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:10.808
Fighting the way you are,
it's damn noble.

01:21:10.849 --> 01:21:14.394
But no matter how good
a fighter you are, just remember:

01:21:14.436 --> 01:21:17.481
I can ask the king to hold
the flag when I putt...

01:21:17.522 --> 01:21:21.985
...but he won't give me his crown.
Neither is Bobby and neither am I.

01:21:22.027 --> 01:21:25.072
I'm not asking for your crown, Walter.

01:21:25.113 --> 01:21:29.492
If I wanted it bad enough,
I'd just take it.

01:22:20.167 --> 01:22:25.547
Do you have something to discuss?
This might not be the right time--

01:22:36.433 --> 01:22:39.060
I can win, Adele.

01:22:39.102 --> 01:22:42.647
I can beat both of them.

01:22:42.689 --> 01:22:46.067
Look in my eyes and tell me
what you see.

01:22:46.109 --> 01:22:49.654
Determination, pure determination.

01:22:49.696 --> 01:22:53.241
Panic, Adele, pure panic.

01:22:53.282 --> 01:22:56.577
I'm eight strokes behind
the two greatest golfers.

01:22:56.619 --> 01:22:59.580
They've never blown a lead,
and I'll win.

01:22:59.622 --> 01:23:00.665
- Know why?
- Panic?

01:23:00.706 --> 01:23:03.584
That's right.

01:23:03.626 --> 01:23:05.503
Oh, Junuh...

01:23:05.544 --> 01:23:09.715
- ...you don't, by any chance--?
- Yes.

01:23:11.133 --> 01:23:15.054
I ought to go back to my guests.

01:23:15.387 --> 01:23:17.431
Yes, I should go back.

01:23:17.473 --> 01:23:19.183
You will stay in touch...

01:23:19.224 --> 01:23:24.313
...I can't wait another 12 years
for the next installment.

01:23:25.397 --> 01:23:27.858
Did you miss something about me?

01:23:27.899 --> 01:23:32.529
Something I can feel gratified about
depriving you of all these years?

01:23:32.571 --> 01:23:36.241
I liked the way we danced.

01:23:50.004 --> 01:23:53.132
I need the driver.
This is gonna take all I got.

01:23:53.174 --> 01:23:56.636
That's a jigger. Help you
keep it under the wind.

01:23:56.678 --> 01:23:59.305
My putter's got more loft
than this thing.

01:23:59.347 --> 01:24:01.557
No, they about the same.

01:24:01.599 --> 01:24:04.727
Good, I'll just putt
the ball down the fairway.

01:24:04.769 --> 01:24:06.896
Anything else?

01:24:06.938 --> 01:24:11.025
Just bash the living shit out of it.

01:24:14.945 --> 01:24:18.490
An iron? I guess it doesn't
matter what you use...

01:24:18.532 --> 01:24:22.619
...when you're eight strokes back.

01:24:46.476 --> 01:24:48.436
- What club was that?
- Mid-iron.

01:24:48.478 --> 01:24:53.650
- Some kind of driving iron.
- Extraordinarily hit, I'd say.

01:25:09.582 --> 01:25:11.542
Pull the flag, Hardy!

01:25:11.584 --> 01:25:14.045
Yes, sir!

01:25:14.086 --> 01:25:18.215
<i>Junuh eagled, picking up
two strokes on the first hole.</i>

01:25:18.257 --> 01:25:21.260
That's it!

01:25:22.928 --> 01:25:27.891
<i>And he picked up another stroke
when Jones bogeyed the second.</i>

01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:35.649
<i>And two more on Hagen
when he double-bogeyed the third.</i>

01:25:35.691 --> 01:25:38.235
Does that look like 180 yards to you?

01:25:38.277 --> 01:25:40.404
No...

01:25:40.445 --> 01:25:43.698
...it's 181.

01:25:44.449 --> 01:25:48.620
Might want to play the ball
back a bit.

01:26:32.663 --> 01:26:35.290
He just hit a hole in one!
Hot dang!

01:26:35.332 --> 01:26:38.126
I just seen a miracle
with my own eyes!

01:26:38.168 --> 01:26:42.130
He just hit a hole in one!

01:26:53.266 --> 01:26:58.063
Homer, you're not gonna believe this,
Junuh made a hole in one!

01:27:00.523 --> 01:27:03.151
He's coming back now!
He's gonna make it!

01:27:03.193 --> 01:27:06.696
- You're kidding!
- What?

01:27:10.616 --> 01:27:12.910
Junuh's making a run for it!

01:27:12.952 --> 01:27:15.746
He's three from Jones
and two from Hagen!

01:27:15.788 --> 01:27:21.210
He made a hole in one! God bless
Savannah and the men she propagates!

01:27:41.730 --> 01:27:46.860
Get back! How do you expect
Junuh to hit the ball?

01:27:52.991 --> 01:27:57.954
<i>His play in the third round
was beautiful to watch.</i>

01:28:21.269 --> 01:28:25.773
<i>While Jones and Hagen discovered
new hazards...</i>

01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:32.905
<i>... Junuh had discovered, as Bagger
had so eloquently put it...</i>

01:28:32.947 --> 01:28:37.451
<i>... how to stop thinking
without falling asleep.</i>

01:28:40.621 --> 01:28:44.666
<i>Junuh finished the third round
one stroke behind.</i>

01:28:44.708 --> 01:28:49.421
<i>It was a new match, and no one
knew it better than Jones and Hagen.</i>

01:28:49.463 --> 01:28:53.842
- Can I have your autograph?
- Not now, girls.

01:29:03.143 --> 01:29:05.979
Gents.

01:29:08.481 --> 01:29:13.152
I don't believe Walter planned
on exerting himself.

01:29:14.654 --> 01:29:18.199
It was fun this morning, wasn't it?

01:29:18.241 --> 01:29:21.369
Yeah, it was.

01:29:22.412 --> 01:29:26.749
This is my last match, Junuh.
I'm retiring.

01:29:29.835 --> 01:29:32.630
You're at the top of your game.

01:29:32.672 --> 01:29:36.717
I've got a wife, three children,
and a law practice.

01:29:36.759 --> 01:29:40.095
It's time to stop.

01:29:45.934 --> 01:29:49.521
It's just a game, Junuh.

01:29:50.189 --> 01:29:55.110
I'll never forget you winning
the Georgia Open in 1916.

01:29:55.527 --> 01:29:58.321
I never seen a swing so sweet...

01:29:58.363 --> 01:30:02.701
...or a man get so much
pleasure from it.

01:30:04.452 --> 01:30:08.081
This is my last 18 holes, Junuh.

01:30:08.123 --> 01:30:11.835
And I couldn't have picked
a better way to end it.

01:30:11.876 --> 01:30:13.336
Thank you, Bobby.

01:30:13.378 --> 01:30:16.965
It is truly my pleasure.

01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:21.594
I can't let you win out of sympathy.

01:30:21.636 --> 01:30:24.263
You know that.

01:30:24.305 --> 01:30:29.143
I do, and I have no intentions
of losing my last match.

01:30:45.826 --> 01:30:49.288
Thank you, Mr. Junuh.

01:30:49.330 --> 01:30:50.622
Junuh!

01:30:50.664 --> 01:30:54.168
Junuh, look over here!

01:30:59.339 --> 01:31:02.217
Which would be more important
to you, beating--?

01:31:02.259 --> 01:31:05.971
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Give him some room. Thank you.

01:31:06.012 --> 01:31:09.891
- I'd like to have a word with you.
- This isn't a good time, Adele.

01:31:09.933 --> 01:31:12.477
No, I think this is
a very good time.

01:31:12.519 --> 01:31:16.564
I don't want to do anything that might
disrupt your concentration...

01:31:16.606 --> 01:31:21.736
...but since our little encounter,
I've been thinking....

01:31:23.029 --> 01:31:26.240
Ten years and not a single,
solitary word from you?

01:31:26.282 --> 01:31:28.910
You don't do that
to someone you love.

01:31:28.951 --> 01:31:33.998
I deserve some correspondence,
and some indication of what you felt.

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:38.669
I don't know what happened to you.
But whatever it was...

01:31:38.711 --> 01:31:41.172
...it wasn't as unbearable...

01:31:41.213 --> 01:31:44.258
...as a woman waiting
with no end in sight...

01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:49.722
...wondering if she's remembered
or forgotten by the man she loves.

01:31:50.556 --> 01:31:53.517
You never even said you were sorry.

01:31:53.559 --> 01:31:58.188
Now I'm supposed to run into your arms
and melt like butter on a hot muffin?

01:31:58.230 --> 01:32:02.109
I'm sorry, Adele. I am truly sorry.

01:32:02.150 --> 01:32:05.195
It's too late for "I'm sorry," Junuh!

01:32:05.237 --> 01:32:09.699
Then tell me what to say.
It was too long ago.

01:32:11.409 --> 01:32:14.579
No, it wasn't.

01:32:14.746 --> 01:32:18.375
It was just a moment ago.

01:32:20.001 --> 01:32:24.547
Did something happen since
we talked last night?

01:32:25.757 --> 01:32:28.468
No.

01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:33.097
Not that I can think of.

01:32:36.517 --> 01:32:39.478
Well, this is barely the place
to talk about it.

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:43.566
You've got to go back to your game.

01:33:07.047 --> 01:33:12.219
This town's gonna give you
the biggest parade you've ever seen!

01:33:18.308 --> 01:33:22.103
<i>Junuh was playing
a fierce fourth round.</i>

01:33:22.145 --> 01:33:26.149
<i>And a wild thought began to percolate:</i>

01:33:26.316 --> 01:33:29.569
<i>Junuh could win.</i>

01:33:30.403 --> 01:33:31.863
<i>To the clouds, Junie!</i>

01:33:31.905 --> 01:33:34.449
- I think the driver.
- Give us a smile!

01:33:34.490 --> 01:33:36.951
He smiled!

01:33:36.993 --> 01:33:38.682
Well you got water out there
on the left side,

01:33:38.724 --> 01:33:41.856
why not put your spoon out there with
Jones and Hagen and play this time smart?

01:33:41.998 --> 01:33:46.711
I'm gonna hug the left, get there
in two and close the door on them.

01:33:46.752 --> 01:33:51.215
Hold yourself now, we've got four more
holes to go. You can settle down a bit.

01:33:51.257 --> 01:33:56.387
I've never been more settled.
An eagle and this thing is over.

01:34:14.446 --> 01:34:18.408
That's 300 yards if it's an inch.

01:34:23.455 --> 01:34:26.333
Longest drive of the day, Mr. Junuh.

01:34:26.374 --> 01:34:30.003
I'm getting there in two.

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:35.508
Two-twenty-five, into the wind,
out the bunker.

01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:40.054
Jeez, the lifts too high.
So much for an eagle.

01:34:40.722 --> 01:34:45.101
Says who? Where's that
driving iron, Bagger?

01:34:45.810 --> 01:34:50.356
There's a time to hit that shot and
there's a time to leave it in the bag.

01:34:50.398 --> 01:34:54.652
Which one of them times
you feel this is?

01:35:07.081 --> 01:35:10.042
Tell him. Tell him it's a mashie...

01:35:10.084 --> 01:35:13.712
- ...so he can have one easy shot--
- That's amazing.

01:35:13.754 --> 01:35:17.633
Man's gonna go for the green
with that clinky thing?

01:35:17.674 --> 01:35:22.721
- He's got the guts of a Greek god.
- I don't care if he's son of Zeus...

01:35:22.763 --> 01:35:25.891
...that ball won't clear the water.

01:35:25.932 --> 01:35:29.978
I hope you're all paying customers.

01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:11.477
- Junuh--
- Hush yourself, Hardy.

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:15.647
If at first you don't succeed....

01:36:39.504 --> 01:36:43.049
Which would make your spot...

01:36:43.091 --> 01:36:46.636
...right here, Junuh.

01:36:48.179 --> 01:36:51.641
Give it to him, move.

01:37:19.042 --> 01:37:21.003
<i>When Junuh dropped that ball...</i>

01:37:21.044 --> 01:37:25.924
<i>... it was as if every heart
in Savannah dropped with it.</i>

01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:30.262
<i>None landing harder than his own.</i>

01:39:24.248 --> 01:39:29.002
You gonna be wanting
a different club, Junuh?

01:39:33.507 --> 01:39:36.301
I can't do this.

01:39:36.343 --> 01:39:38.637
Just loose your grip up a smidge.

01:39:38.679 --> 01:39:42.641
- A man's grip is like a--
- That's not what I'm talking about.

01:39:42.682 --> 01:39:46.228
- I know.
- No, you don't.

01:39:46.603 --> 01:39:49.064
What I'm talking about is a game...

01:39:49.105 --> 01:39:51.232
...a game that can't be won...

01:39:51.274 --> 01:39:54.903
- ...only played.
- You don't understand.

01:39:54.944 --> 01:39:57.322
I don't need to understand.

01:39:57.363 --> 01:40:01.409
Ain't a soul who ain't got a burden
to carry he don't understand.

01:40:01.451 --> 01:40:03.661
You ain't alone in that.

01:40:03.703 --> 01:40:07.081
But you've been carrying
this one long enough.

01:40:07.123 --> 01:40:10.835
Time to go on, lay it down.

01:40:13.129 --> 01:40:16.424
I don't know how.

01:40:17.383 --> 01:40:19.760
You got a choice.

01:40:19.802 --> 01:40:21.345
You can stop...

01:40:21.387 --> 01:40:25.015
- ...or you could start.
- Start?

01:40:25.057 --> 01:40:27.101
- Walking.
- Where?

01:40:27.142 --> 01:40:31.647
Back to where you've been
and then stand there.

01:40:32.398 --> 01:40:34.191
Still.

01:40:34.233 --> 01:40:37.861
Real still, and remember.

01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:42.991
- It was too long ago.
- No, sir, it was just a moment ago.

01:40:47.078 --> 01:40:51.249
Time to come on out
the shadows, Junuh.

01:40:52.334 --> 01:40:55.879
Time for you to choose.

01:40:59.924 --> 01:41:02.468
- I can't.
- You can.

01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:05.388
You ain't alone.

01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:08.558
I'm right here with you.

01:41:08.599 --> 01:41:12.228
I've been here all along.

01:41:18.109 --> 01:41:20.569
Now play the game.

01:41:20.611 --> 01:41:24.073
Your game. The one that only you
was meant to play.

01:41:24.115 --> 01:41:28.285
The one given to you
when you was born.

01:41:37.044 --> 01:41:40.047
You ready?

01:41:41.215 --> 01:41:44.885
Come on, take your stance.

01:41:49.139 --> 01:41:53.727
Strike that ball, Junuh.
Don't hold nothing back.

01:41:53.810 --> 01:41:55.520
Now's the time.

01:41:55.562 --> 01:41:58.106
Let yourself remember.

01:41:58.148 --> 01:42:01.568
Remember your swing.

01:42:01.651 --> 01:42:06.281
That's right, Junuh.
Settle yourself, that's good.

01:42:06.406 --> 01:42:09.951
Now is the time, Junuh.

01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:54.953
Let's go, Hardy.

01:42:59.207 --> 01:43:01.334
Hey, Bagger.

01:43:01.376 --> 01:43:06.464
- You are one hell of a caddy.
- I do the best with what I got.

01:43:06.965 --> 01:43:10.301
We ain't done yet.

01:43:24.982 --> 01:43:29.445
<i>By the 17th,
Junuh got his swing back.</i>

01:43:32.490 --> 01:43:36.785
You have the right to call
the game on account of darkness.

01:43:36.827 --> 01:43:41.540
That crowd will string us up
by our thumbs if we do.

01:43:45.419 --> 01:43:49.256
All right! Play will continue!

01:44:14.114 --> 01:44:18.660
This is when I need pals
in the mermaids' union.

01:45:11.419 --> 01:45:13.880
Cars! Get your cars, boys!

01:45:13.922 --> 01:45:18.468
I want every car on this property
lined up with lights blazing!

01:45:18.510 --> 01:45:23.932
I don't care if you're kitchen help
or Savannah police, get your car!

01:45:44.452 --> 01:45:46.413
Does he have a shot?

01:45:47.354 --> 01:45:51.750
<i>Then Hagen came back from the dead.</i>

01:45:57.464 --> 01:45:59.508
You got a smoke?

01:45:59.550 --> 01:46:02.678
Tell Spec to hold the flag
in case I make it.

01:46:02.719 --> 01:46:06.139
I want a three iron.

01:46:08.392 --> 01:46:11.937
Get my shoes, will you?

01:46:17.484 --> 01:46:21.529
- What's going on?
- Hagen wants Spec to hold the flag.

01:46:21.571 --> 01:46:25.408
I'm gonna miss playing Walter.

01:47:02.277 --> 01:47:05.864
Don't hold nothing back.

01:47:22.881 --> 01:47:24.424
The ball moved.

01:47:24.466 --> 01:47:26.593
No.

01:47:26.634 --> 01:47:29.596
It moved.

01:47:30.305 --> 01:47:34.309
I have to call a stroke on myself.

01:47:37.228 --> 01:47:39.188
No!

01:47:39.230 --> 01:47:42.108
No, don't do it! Please don't do it.

01:47:42.150 --> 01:47:46.279
Only you and me seen it,
and I won't tell a soul. I promise.

01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:49.448
Nobody will know.

01:47:49.490 --> 01:47:52.660
I will, Hardy.

01:47:52.993 --> 01:47:56.080
So will you.

01:47:56.914 --> 01:47:59.708
You've got to tell him not to do it.

01:47:59.750 --> 01:48:02.544
It's a stupid rule
that don't mean nothing.

01:48:02.586 --> 01:48:06.423
That's a choice for Mr. Junuh.

01:48:07.424 --> 01:48:11.803
<i>No one wanted the penalty assessed,
not even Jones and Hagen.</i>

01:48:11.845 --> 01:48:14.556
<i>This was no way to win a match.</i>

01:48:14.598 --> 01:48:16.892
Maybe you're mistaken, Junuh.

01:48:16.933 --> 01:48:19.311
Maybe It moved before
you touched the impediment.

01:48:19.352 --> 01:48:22.898
Might not have moved at all.
The light plays tricks.

01:48:22.939 --> 01:48:27.986
"A ball is deemed to have moved if it
leaves its original position...

01:48:28.028 --> 01:48:33.783
...but not if it merely oscillates
and returns to its original position."

01:48:35.118 --> 01:48:37.912
Is she different?

01:48:37.954 --> 01:48:39.414
Can you be certain?

01:48:39.455 --> 01:48:44.669
Sometimes a ball will shudder
and then settle back again, Junuh.

01:48:48.047 --> 01:48:52.301
The ball was here,
and it rolled to here.

01:49:01.143 --> 01:49:05.522
Hit it quick,
before you have time to think.

01:49:31.673 --> 01:49:33.049
You're leaving.

01:49:33.091 --> 01:49:36.511
Yes, sir. Yes, I am.

01:49:36.761 --> 01:49:38.555
I need you.

01:49:38.596 --> 01:49:40.473
No.

01:49:40.515 --> 01:49:42.642
No, you don't.

01:49:42.684 --> 01:49:45.478
Not no more.

01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:49.774
There is a small matter,
around about $5.

01:49:50.691 --> 01:49:53.819
It was guaranteed.

01:49:53.861 --> 01:49:56.656
Yes, it was.

01:49:56.697 --> 01:50:02.077
You won't need these shoes back now
that I broke them in to my foot.

01:50:07.791 --> 01:50:11.003
Thank you, sir.

01:50:19.553 --> 01:50:22.347
This man is yours, Hardy.

01:50:22.389 --> 01:50:24.850
Take him on in.

01:50:24.891 --> 01:50:27.352
You want me...

01:50:27.394 --> 01:50:30.939
...to take over for you?

01:50:30.981 --> 01:50:32.357
You leaving me?

01:50:32.399 --> 01:50:35.986
Only for a little while.

01:50:36.486 --> 01:50:39.531
You pick up Mr. Junuh's bag.

01:50:39.572 --> 01:50:41.866
You tote it real straight.

01:50:41.908 --> 01:50:44.619
But what if something comes up...

01:50:44.661 --> 01:50:47.789
...and I don't know what to do?

01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:51.459
I got a feeling you'll figure it out.

01:50:51.501 --> 01:50:54.879
I'll be seeing you.

01:51:06.265 --> 01:51:08.392
Wait. What's going on?

01:51:08.434 --> 01:51:13.939
You can't leave him now, he needs you.
You're the only chance he's got.

01:51:14.023 --> 01:51:18.235
You go, and you'll never caddy
in Georgia again!

01:51:18.277 --> 01:51:21.280
You hear?!

01:51:38.129 --> 01:51:39.506
Where's Junuh lie?

01:51:39.547 --> 01:51:43.510
Two and a penalty. This is three.

01:51:52.477 --> 01:51:56.564
I can't hit it any better than that.

01:52:14.081 --> 01:52:19.253
Judging from the sound, I think
I knocked your ball in the cup.

01:52:29.596 --> 01:52:32.933
Interesting match.

01:52:33.266 --> 01:52:36.686
I always thought so.

01:52:39.606 --> 01:52:43.276
Out of the way. Step back.

01:52:48.198 --> 01:52:52.076
<i>Hagen and Jones both lay two,
a shot ahead of Junuh.</i>

01:52:52.118 --> 01:52:56.873
<i>If either of them sank their putts,
Junuh would lose.</i>

01:52:58.291 --> 01:53:01.502
What do you think, Hardy?

01:53:01.544 --> 01:53:02.837
Well....

01:53:02.879 --> 01:53:05.423
The night air's gotten colder.

01:53:05.464 --> 01:53:10.177
My guess is it's put a layer of dew
on the warmer grass...

01:53:10.219 --> 01:53:14.306
...which will slow your ball down.

01:53:19.645 --> 01:53:22.773
Why don't you go stand
with your father?

01:53:22.815 --> 01:53:25.609
- Are you sure?
- Go ahead.

01:53:25.651 --> 01:53:28.487
Go on.

01:53:37.579 --> 01:53:40.707
That is one tough shot.

01:53:40.749 --> 01:53:43.668
Make it.

01:56:57.190 --> 01:57:02.404
Rannulph Junuh of Savannah, Georgia,
has tied Mr. Jones and Mr. Hagen...

01:57:02.445 --> 01:57:07.325
...in the greatest golf match
the world has ever seen!

01:57:35.728 --> 01:57:41.191
<i>That was the last match in
competition Bobby Jones ever played.</i>

01:57:41.567 --> 01:57:46.738
<i>From that time on, Walter Hagen
played only exhibition matches.</i>

01:57:57.916 --> 01:58:02.712
<i>As for Captain Rannulph Junuh
and Adele Invergordon...</i>

01:58:03.588 --> 01:58:07.384
<i>... they did have that dance.</i>

01:58:22.857 --> 01:58:25.735
<i>And me?</i>

01:58:26.277 --> 01:58:29.739
<i>Well it seems like yesterday
I used to see old guys like me...</i>

01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:34.785
<i>... and wonder why they still bothered
with this crazy game.</i>

01:58:45.296 --> 01:58:47.089
<i>But it doesn't matter.</i>

01:58:47.131 --> 01:58:52.094
<i>As Bagger once said, "It's a game
that can't be won, only played."</i>

01:58:52.136 --> 01:58:53.929
<i>And so I play.</i>

01:58:53.971 --> 01:58:55.681
<i>I play on.</i>

01:58:55.722 --> 01:58:59.434
<i>I play for the moments yet to come...</i>

01:58:59.476 --> 01:59:03.605
<i>... looking for my place in the field.</i>

01:59:04.305 --> 01:59:10.815
