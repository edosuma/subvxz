Strange New Worlds...

00:26.678 --> 00:28.985
Spock, will you marry me?

00:29.029 --> 00:30.030
M'BENGA:
You are experiencing

00:30.073 --> 00:32.641
what we humans call stress.

00:32.683 --> 00:35.078
I am concerned my emotions
may impact my judgement.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.906
You'll just have to learn
to live with them.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.516
-SPOCK: I apologize.
-T'PRING: It was

00:38.560 --> 00:39.778
-an impressive gambit.
-SPOCK: You knew?

00:39.822 --> 00:41.171
I never actually
believed you could

00:41.215 --> 00:42.303
having feelings
for Nurse Chapel.

00:42.346 --> 00:44.000
You do not die!

00:44.044 --> 00:45.393
M'BENGA:
Are you all right?

00:45.436 --> 00:47.351
I have no words
for what I feel.

00:47.395 --> 00:49.962
-Doctor, Lieutenant.
-If you'll excuse me.

00:50.006 --> 00:52.139
-M'BENGA: Was there
something else?
-It's about that fellowship--

00:52.182 --> 00:54.489
the archaeological medicine.
I'm thinking about applying.

00:54.532 --> 00:56.534
I'm going to have
to replace you, aren't I?

Christine Chapel's personal log,

stardate 1789.3.

01:05.543 --> 01:07.719
We're en route
to the Vulcan system.

01:07.763 --> 01:10.940
Our mission:
to survey the moon of Kerkhov,

01:10.983 --> 01:13.116
on the far side of the sector.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.858
An ancient civilization once
lived there,

01:15.901 --> 01:17.338
then vanished.

01:17.381 --> 01:19.340
Long-range scans suggest
the presence

01:19.383 --> 01:22.646
of a strange energy anomaly
just above the surface.

01:22.691 --> 01:24.823
A few of us are hoping
that it will provide answers

01:24.867 --> 01:26.912
about where
the Kerkhovians went.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.394
As for the rest of the crew...

01:30.438 --> 01:33.484
the captain has decided
to travel at sub-impulse speeds

01:33.527 --> 01:36.313
so we can all
take in the view.

01:37.967 --> 01:40.187
Now, we find ourselves
with an excess

01:40.229 --> 01:43.712
of the most valuable commodity
in the galaxy:

01:43.755 --> 01:45.539
downtime.

01:45.583 --> 01:48.195
I'm using it to prep
for an interview

01:48.238 --> 01:50.152
for a two-month fellowship

01:50.197 --> 01:52.721
sponsored by
the Vulcan Science Academy.

01:52.764 --> 01:54.810
What are Korby's
three principles

01:54.853 --> 01:56.507
of archeological medicine?

01:56.551 --> 01:58.727
One-- medicine is always
ancient and new,

01:58.770 --> 02:00.207
as cultures' understanding

02:00.250 --> 02:02.818
of what medicine is
changes over time.

02:02.861 --> 02:05.647
Two-- the keys to solving
our toughest medical problems

02:05.690 --> 02:07.518
are often found
by looking backward.

02:07.562 --> 02:10.565
-Correct.
-[laughs softly]

02:10.608 --> 02:13.263
Three-- as a result,
archeological medicine

02:13.307 --> 02:15.483
is as much a study of history
as it is of science.

02:15.526 --> 02:18.442
Drink.

02:20.314 --> 02:22.707
LA'AN:
I don't get it.

02:22.751 --> 02:24.709
Your interview is with a Vulcan.

02:24.753 --> 02:27.495
So, why aren't you practicing
with Mr. Spock?

02:27.538 --> 02:31.499
Oh, things are
kind of weird between them.

02:31.542 --> 02:33.370
Weird how?

02:40.899 --> 02:42.988
Deck 12.

02:58.917 --> 03:00.745
SPOCK:
Science officer's
personal log,

03:00.789 --> 03:02.878
stardate 1789.3.

03:02.921 --> 03:04.880
The recent downtime
en route to Vulcan

03:04.923 --> 03:06.751
has been most advantageous.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.884
I owe my success to Dr. M'Benga,

03:08.927 --> 03:11.843
who provided me with therapies
to better control my emotions.

03:11.887 --> 03:13.628
Fully suppressing them
has allowed me

03:13.671 --> 03:15.325
to carry out my duties,

03:15.369 --> 03:18.067
as well as explore
new interests, such as cooking.

03:18.110 --> 03:21.505
Always use fresh herbs,
not synthesized.

03:21.549 --> 03:22.941
You can tell.
Here.

03:22.985 --> 03:24.334
Smell.

03:25.335 --> 03:26.815
I am afraid
my nasal suppressants

03:26.858 --> 03:28.991
inhibit my perception of scent.

03:29.034 --> 03:30.862
-Suppressants?
-Many Vulcans use them.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.341
Not to be indelicate, Captain,

03:32.386 --> 03:34.083
but the scent of humans
is something

03:34.126 --> 03:36.825
most Vulcans must become...
used to.

03:36.868 --> 03:39.043
O-Oh.

03:39.088 --> 03:40.394
Well,

03:40.437 --> 03:42.961
all I can say is...

03:43.005 --> 03:44.702
you're missing
the good stuff here.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.315
Really?

03:48.358 --> 03:50.491
SAM:
A shuttle pass-by of the moon

03:50.534 --> 03:51.927
should explain how and why

03:51.970 --> 03:53.929
the Kerkhovian
civilization vanished.

03:53.972 --> 03:55.670
SPOCK: In addition,
targeted suppression

03:55.713 --> 03:57.411
has allowed me
to eliminate triggers

03:57.454 --> 04:00.283
that might lead to
an emotional overload.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.285
...detected by the surface
of the moon

04:02.329 --> 04:04.940
by our long-range scans.
Now, my theory is

04:04.983 --> 04:07.943
the energy anomaly is related
to sunspot activity,

04:07.986 --> 04:10.032
which has actually increased
on Eridani b

04:10.075 --> 04:11.381
in the last month or so.

04:11.425 --> 04:13.427
As for the Kerkhovians, well...

04:13.470 --> 04:15.429
SPOCK:
Best of all, it has
allowed me to return

04:15.472 --> 04:17.909
to a normal state
of friendship and comity

04:17.952 --> 04:19.346
-with my fellow officers.
-So I said,

04:19.389 --> 04:20.911
"Thanks for the tool."

04:20.956 --> 04:22.479
And then took off in the shuttle

04:22.523 --> 04:24.176
with all their uniforms
still inside!

04:24.220 --> 04:26.266
[laughing]

04:34.143 --> 04:36.319
Fascinating.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.843
I am content.
And very much

04:38.887 --> 04:40.845
looking forward
to the upcoming reunion

04:40.889 --> 04:44.414
with my fiancée T'Pring
upon our arrival at Vulcan.

04:44.457 --> 04:46.851
Spock, there is a situation I
felt the need to apprise you of.

04:46.895 --> 04:48.592
During your upcoming visit,
I have arranged

04:48.636 --> 04:51.116
to have our ceremonial
engagement dinner.

04:51.159 --> 04:53.423
A V'Shal dinner?

04:53.467 --> 04:55.425
Is it not too soon?

04:55.469 --> 04:58.036
After all, I am still
not speaking to my father.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.430
My parents are aware
of the situation with Sarek.

05:00.474 --> 05:03.868
And yet, with your Starfleet
schedule so challenging,

05:03.912 --> 05:06.523
my mother felt
this would be best.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.873
-This was T'Pril's idea?
-Yes.

05:08.917 --> 05:11.311
She remains opposed
to our union.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.661
I believe providing this will

05:13.704 --> 05:15.663
alleviate some...

05:15.706 --> 05:17.707
tension.

05:17.752 --> 05:19.362
A logical assessment.

05:19.406 --> 05:22.365
I will help in any way
that I am able.

05:22.409 --> 05:25.325
PIKE [muffled]:
Spock?

05:25.368 --> 05:28.632
[regular volume]:
Spock?

05:28.676 --> 05:30.939
-Hmm?
-I said I wanted to discuss

05:30.982 --> 05:32.506
some personnel changes
for your upcoming mission

05:32.549 --> 05:34.769
to the Kerkhovian moon.

05:34.812 --> 05:36.771
Spock... [sighs]

05:36.814 --> 05:38.860
...is everything all right?

05:38.903 --> 05:40.427
I am sorry, Captain.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.037
I have recently learned
that T'Pring wants

05:42.080 --> 05:43.647
to have our ceremonial
engagement dinner

05:43.691 --> 05:45.780
upon our arrival on Vulcan.

05:45.823 --> 05:49.914
This is, as you humans say,
a big deal.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.917
Would you rather not
pilot the shuttle

05:52.961 --> 05:55.180
-during our flyby of the moon?
-I am fine, Captain.

05:55.224 --> 05:57.052
A momentary distraction.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.054
It will help me
to stay focused on work.

05:59.097 --> 06:01.970
Doubtless, any personnel changes
you wish to make are helpful.

06:02.013 --> 06:05.277
Good, because now
you have a passenger.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.549
It is good to see you,
Nurse Chapel.

06:17.246 --> 06:20.989
We did see each other
in the turbolift the other day.

06:21.032 --> 06:23.121
You seemed busy.

06:23.165 --> 06:26.211
I have many duties.
If I offended you, I apologize.

06:29.737 --> 06:32.000
You are here for the fellowship
you are applying to?

06:32.043 --> 06:33.957
Archeological medicine?

06:34.002 --> 06:36.831
If we can figure out what
happened to the Kerkhovians,

06:36.874 --> 06:40.138
it might unlock a treasure trove
of medical data.

06:40.182 --> 06:43.228
They were rumored to have
a robust system of medicine,

06:43.272 --> 06:45.579
more advanced than
anything available today.

06:45.622 --> 06:47.798
Hmm. Yeah.

06:49.234 --> 06:52.324
You know, the Vulcan
Science Academy would be lucky

06:52.368 --> 06:54.152
to have someone
of your experience.

06:54.196 --> 06:55.980
Thanks.

06:56.024 --> 06:59.070
It's, um...
it's nice of you to say.

07:00.942 --> 07:03.031
Spock?

07:03.074 --> 07:06.556
I don't usually read into
this sort of thing much,

07:06.600 --> 07:09.777
but, uh, it's felt like
you've been avoiding me.

07:09.820 --> 07:12.083
Has it?

07:12.127 --> 07:14.042
COMPUTER:
Ship now in scanning range

07:14.085 --> 07:16.044
of the Kerkhovian moon.

07:16.087 --> 07:19.830
I should... initiate scans.

07:19.874 --> 07:21.789
Yeah.

07:33.191 --> 07:35.629
They, uh, left behind

07:35.672 --> 07:37.369
quite a civilization.

07:37.413 --> 07:38.980
Got a theory
about what happened to them?

07:39.023 --> 07:40.982
We are hoping
the energy signature we detected

07:41.025 --> 07:43.245
might provide a new clue.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.681
COMPUTER:
Energy anomaly detected.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.117
That's the signature?

07:47.118 --> 07:51.383
Yes. The readings are unusual.

07:51.427 --> 07:54.256
It appears to be some sort
of stable vortex.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.345
A rupture in spacetime.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.403
[alarm beeping]

08:12.404 --> 08:14.189
Gravitational radiation
is headed right for us.

08:14.232 --> 08:16.278
Maximum power
to forward shields.

08:16.321 --> 08:18.672
COMPUTER:
Forward shields at maximum.

08:20.151 --> 08:22.153
My systems are crashing.

08:22.197 --> 08:23.546
Steering is compromised.

08:23.590 --> 08:24.895
How compromised?

08:24.939 --> 08:26.593
I am turning into the skid,

08:26.636 --> 08:29.073
and the skid
is taking us into that.

08:44.306 --> 08:46.264
[echoing]:
Spock.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.357
M'BENGA:
Mr. Spock.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.490
Try to be still.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.058
You were in a shuttle accident.

08:57.101 --> 09:00.583
SPOCK:
I feel... strange.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.237
PIKE:
You were injured.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.413
What's happened to me?

09:04.456 --> 09:06.633
We don't exactly know.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.768
We crashed.

09:11.812 --> 09:15.119
And then we woke up in space,

09:15.163 --> 09:17.469
right near the Enterprise.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.254
Nurse Chapel was unhurt,

09:19.297 --> 09:21.430
but you were...

09:22.474 --> 09:24.912
You were healed.

09:24.955 --> 09:28.132
Only, whoever did this

09:28.176 --> 09:30.134
seems to have made you

to explore strange new worlds...

10:05.735 --> 10:08.172
...to seek out new life

10:08.216 --> 10:10.610
and new civilizations,

10:11.872 --> 10:15.876
to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

Not sure yet.

11:44.660 --> 11:47.750
We found the shuttle floating
dead in space.

11:47.794 --> 11:50.622
UNA:
I checked the logs. They were
in a crash, but it's like

11:50.665 --> 11:53.364
the shuttle has been fixed
and given a...

11:53.408 --> 11:55.627
deep cleaning.

This look like part

It's definitely alien.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.122
I have a theory

12:12.166 --> 12:13.776
Enlighten us, Ensign.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.343
I think it's a calling card.

12:15.386 --> 12:16.997
These look like
routing instructions

12:17.040 --> 12:18.694
for a subspace call.

Can you patch us through, Nyota?

12:20.740 --> 12:22.480
I can try, sir.

12:22.524 --> 12:25.962
Huh. It looks like
I'm getting visuals back.

I am called Yellow.
I am of Kerkhov.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.826
The accident.
Remediation has been made

per our laws.
No further contact is necessary.

13:05.785 --> 13:09.353
We're not familiar

13:09.397 --> 13:11.573
Your vessel collided
with our transport tunnel.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.227
In the event of an accident,
the damage must be repaired.

13:13.270 --> 13:14.794
This was accomplished.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.926
No further contact
is necessary.

13:16.970 --> 13:20.190
Right, but you repaired
a member of our crew.

13:20.234 --> 13:23.150
Two beings were present.
They did not match.

13:23.193 --> 13:25.848
One was damaged but contained
mixed instructions.

13:25.892 --> 13:28.329
Mixed instructions?
You don't mean Spock.

13:28.372 --> 13:30.157
Remediation was made.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.854
The beings now match.

13:31.898 --> 13:34.857
-Are the beings alive or dead?
-Mm, well, uh,

13:34.901 --> 13:36.641
-they're alive, but...
-Then remediation was made.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.600
Thanks are not required.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.994
No further contact
is necessary.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.822
-[screen clicks off]
-Uhura, get 'em back.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.737
I'm trying, sir.
It's not working.

13:45.781 --> 13:48.566
SPOCK:
It would appear
I'm stuck like this.

13:48.610 --> 13:52.222
For now.
We're working on a cure.

13:52.266 --> 13:55.312
How do you, uh...
feel, Mr. Spock?

13:55.356 --> 13:57.532
I feel...

13:57.575 --> 13:59.229
angry.

14:00.491 --> 14:03.190
And... powerless.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.888
And annoyed.

14:05.932 --> 14:08.238
And... weirdly hungry?

14:08.282 --> 14:09.805
Is this a normal
human feeling?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.198
Hunger can affect your mood.

14:11.241 --> 14:12.895
We'll get you something to eat.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.505
I feel grateful that
you're trying to help me.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.377
Seriously, it's so nice of you.

14:16.420 --> 14:19.162
There is the matter
of your obligations on Vulcan.

14:20.207 --> 14:21.904
It slipped my mind
during the recovery.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.952
I don't know how

14:25.995 --> 14:27.954
I can attend my engagement
dinner while I'm in this state.

14:27.997 --> 14:29.781
My fiancée's mother--

14:29.825 --> 14:31.261
she hates me.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.396
Do I smell more human?

14:35.439 --> 14:37.398
I've already spoken
to T'Pring and to your family.

14:37.441 --> 14:40.662
What did you tell them, Captain?
Because T'Pring's mother--

14:40.705 --> 14:42.490
if she heard I was human?

14:42.533 --> 14:44.013
This could be
a serious disaster!

14:44.057 --> 14:46.624
Whoa. Whoa.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.017
I simply told them
that you were in an accident

14:48.061 --> 14:49.845
and you're recovering
on the ship.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.195
They agreed that it was logical
to postpone the dinner.

14:52.239 --> 14:54.545
That is... reassuring.

14:54.589 --> 14:57.505
Nurse Chapel is already working
around the clock

14:57.548 --> 14:59.899
to find a way to reverse
your genetic alteration.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.813
But in the meantime,

15:01.857 --> 15:03.990
there is nothing--

15:04.033 --> 15:07.167
technically-- wrong with you.

15:07.210 --> 15:10.039
Then I should return to my
duties and social obligations.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.433
Well, mm...

15:12.476 --> 15:15.697
all right.
But take it easy, Mr. Spock.

15:15.740 --> 15:18.178
Go slow.
Get your sea legs under you.

15:18.221 --> 15:19.875
All right?

15:19.919 --> 15:22.138
Aye aye, Captain.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.404
-[door whooshes open]
-I hope this isn't a mistake.

15:28.710 --> 15:32.583
So, he's like,
"Sorry, I'm only human...

15:32.627 --> 15:34.629
from the neck up."

15:34.672 --> 15:36.718
[laughter]

15:41.592 --> 15:44.595
[chuckles softly]

15:48.295 --> 15:49.861
Now, the point of whisking
is to add air

15:49.905 --> 15:51.559
to increase the volume
of the eggs...

15:51.602 --> 15:53.996
I'm sorry, but Captain,
what is that amazing smell?

15:54.040 --> 15:55.998
Um...

15:56.042 --> 15:57.652
Oh, it's the bacon.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.915
Bacon?

16:00.916 --> 16:02.962
[sniffing deeply]

16:06.443 --> 16:07.749
Fascinating.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.969
SAM:
Analysis of the stable vortex

16:10.012 --> 16:12.058
suggests the Kerkhovians
may have moved on

16:12.101 --> 16:14.321
from their planet
to interdimensional space.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.279
Don't forget to clean that up
when you're done, Lieutenant.

16:18.281 --> 16:20.936
Okay. Sure.

16:21.937 --> 16:23.417
As I was saying...

16:23.460 --> 16:25.158
[laughing]

16:25.201 --> 16:27.421
Human... from the neck up?

16:27.464 --> 16:29.640
-Yeah.
-[laughter continues]

16:34.645 --> 16:38.214
Mmm. Mmm.
Smoky and salty and sweet

16:38.258 --> 16:40.086
and soft and crispy
all at the same time.

16:40.129 --> 16:41.348
I must have more.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.611
SAM:
Scans of the moon

16:43.654 --> 16:45.482
revealed the remains
of several cultural sites.

16:45.526 --> 16:48.094
Mr. Kirk!

16:48.137 --> 16:50.052
Clean your mess.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.142
Are you serious?

16:53.186 --> 16:54.230
[laughing]

16:54.274 --> 16:56.015
[thump]

16:58.147 --> 17:00.106
Don't you get it?

17:00.149 --> 17:02.543
-Don't you get it? I got it.
-Yeah.

17:05.285 --> 17:07.678
Spock, I'd slow down a bit
if I were you.

17:07.722 --> 17:10.637
Slow down?
I'm making up for lost time.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.684
Why do I feel nauseated?

17:13.728 --> 17:16.122
[braying]

17:25.957 --> 17:27.829
Sorry.
Got so thirsty.

17:29.265 --> 17:30.832
-[growling]
-Oh, oh...

17:30.875 --> 17:31.963
Don't test me, Kirk!

17:32.007 --> 17:34.705
I will break you!

17:34.749 --> 17:36.446
I'll clean it up.

17:37.404 --> 17:38.796
[grunting]

17:38.840 --> 17:41.060
Emotions must be new to you.

17:42.496 --> 17:45.412
Vulcans have emotions.
We learn to suppress them.

17:45.455 --> 17:48.502
These human feelings
are different.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.852
They're intense,

17:50.895 --> 17:52.593
and they never stop.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.073
What you're going through--
it sounds a lot

17:54.116 --> 17:55.509
like being a human teenager.

17:55.552 --> 17:57.511
-You've felt like this before?
-Oh, yes.

17:57.554 --> 18:00.688
Adolescence
is a delightful cocktail

18:00.731 --> 18:04.039
of anger, fear,
sexual attraction

18:04.083 --> 18:07.477
and, uh, hunger.

18:07.521 --> 18:10.480
You're constantly snacking,
like, so many snacks.

18:10.524 --> 18:11.960
[chuckles]
I am hungry.

18:13.788 --> 18:15.311
But I'm also sad

18:15.355 --> 18:17.748
and frustrated.

18:17.792 --> 18:20.055
I also feel...

18:20.099 --> 18:22.927
strange feelings stirring.

18:28.585 --> 18:30.152
And now I'm embarrassed.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.024
[clears throat]

18:34.678 --> 18:37.072
You just need
to work on impulse control.

18:40.641 --> 18:41.946
[buzzer sounds]

18:41.990 --> 18:43.426
Damn it.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.604
[sighs]

18:47.648 --> 18:49.693
Have you been here all night?

18:49.737 --> 18:51.608
Oh, well, my protein sequences

18:51.652 --> 18:54.133
keep collapsing into goo.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.657
I don't know
how those aliens did this.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.312
They are inscrutable,
interdimensional beings

18:59.355 --> 19:02.445
who don't experience space
and time the way we do.

19:02.489 --> 19:04.317
That might be part of it.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.841
I feel responsible.

19:07.885 --> 19:09.539
If I hadn't been there,
then maybe they wouldn't have

19:09.583 --> 19:10.932
done what they did to Spock.

19:10.975 --> 19:13.195
If you hadn't been there,
he might be dead,

19:13.239 --> 19:16.111
and you wouldn't have had
a chance to save him at all.

19:19.506 --> 19:23.118
Survivor's guilt is easy
to spot from the outside,

19:23.162 --> 19:26.077
but it's not fun
from the inside.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.601
Take a break, then.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.432
Are you forgetting
something important?

19:34.999 --> 19:37.741
Interview.
Oh, I got to go.

19:41.484 --> 19:44.661
Hi, I'm Christine.
Apologies for the delay.

19:44.705 --> 19:46.228
I read your essay, Miss Chapel,

19:46.272 --> 19:48.491
and frankly, I'm not impressed.

19:48.535 --> 19:51.494
Oh, I'm sorry you didn't like
what I had to say.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.235
Your reproduction of
the principles were sloppy,

19:53.279 --> 19:55.498
you did not recreate
the proper syntax,

19:55.542 --> 19:58.371
and your word choice varied
too much from the original.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.199
I was just trying not to
repeat them word for word.

20:00.242 --> 20:03.071
Memorization is a core part
of this fellowship.

20:03.114 --> 20:05.073
You must commit to memory
a year's material

20:05.116 --> 20:07.728
to even be considered
for my seminar.

20:07.771 --> 20:09.947
Well, I just thought that maybe
my field work would be relevant,

20:09.991 --> 20:14.300
-given that I've made
several discoveries.
-Field work.

20:14.343 --> 20:18.608
-Hmm. I will glance at it.
That is all.
-What?

20:18.652 --> 20:20.219
We're done?

20:20.262 --> 20:21.742
I have all I need.
We will contact you.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.396
Good day, Miss Chapel.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.148
Christine?

20:37.192 --> 20:40.282
Oh, hey, Spock.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.718
Are you okay?
You look upset.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.503
Yeah.
It's just been a tough day.

20:43.546 --> 20:45.983
I'm fine.
I'll be fine.

20:46.027 --> 20:48.159
Is it about the fellowship?

20:48.203 --> 20:50.640
Uh, I don't really
want to talk about it.

20:50.684 --> 20:52.773
Vulcans can be such jerks.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.615
It felt like you needed that.
Did I read the moment wrong?

21:08.658 --> 21:10.138
No, it was really nice.

21:10.181 --> 21:12.880
It wasn't typical for you.

21:12.923 --> 21:14.273
Is that okay?

21:15.274 --> 21:18.451
Um, how's, uh, feeling going?

21:18.494 --> 21:20.366
It's a lot.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.716
I'm still getting used to it.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.021
It's not all bad.

21:24.065 --> 21:25.371
Sometimes I don't
cry in the shower.

21:27.068 --> 21:28.330
Kidding.

21:28.374 --> 21:31.072
Sorry.
I'm fine.

21:31.115 --> 21:34.249
I'll be fine.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.772
PIKE [over comm]:
Pike to Spock.

21:35.816 --> 21:37.252
Meet me in the transporter room
right away.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.297
Acknowledged.

21:38.340 --> 21:41.300
Is it an emergency, Captain?

21:41.343 --> 21:43.519
That depends on your
definition of emergency.

21:43.563 --> 21:45.565
Your mother is beaming aboard.

21:47.610 --> 21:49.351
Pelia sends her regards.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.440
She regrets she can't be here,
but she's off dealing with

21:51.484 --> 21:53.050
our dilithium shortage.

21:53.094 --> 21:55.792
Knowing her,
she's probably off procuring

21:55.836 --> 21:57.968
some weird antiques as well.

21:58.012 --> 21:59.883
She did seem
awfully enthusiastic

21:59.927 --> 22:02.277
-about purchasing dilithium.
-[chuckles]

22:03.365 --> 22:07.282
Spock, I am so sorry for
surprising you like this, but...

22:08.327 --> 22:09.850
Why are you wearing
that silly hat?

22:09.893 --> 22:13.462
It's not silly.
It's regulation.

22:13.506 --> 22:14.855
I have one just like it.

22:14.898 --> 22:17.292
Regardless, I come with news.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.729
T'Pring's family is not happy.

22:19.773 --> 22:21.688
The engagement dinner
has been moved several times

22:21.731 --> 22:23.690
due to your Starfleet schedule,
a fact which

22:23.733 --> 22:25.518
they are not
understanding about.

22:25.561 --> 22:28.303
We have to do
the V'Shal dinner now

22:28.347 --> 22:30.174
or the wedding is off.

22:30.218 --> 22:31.698
But that's impossible.

22:31.741 --> 22:33.787
For many reasons.

22:34.788 --> 22:36.355
Right, Captain?

22:36.398 --> 22:39.358
Uh, uh, y... The...
Yeah, the-the, um,

22:39.401 --> 22:41.490
schedule is quite full.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.666
But I thought you're on
half-duty rotation

22:43.710 --> 22:44.928
to give the crew rest.

22:44.972 --> 22:48.105
That is technically

22:48.149 --> 22:49.498
true.

22:49.542 --> 22:52.240
Good. Because...

22:52.283 --> 22:53.937
T'Pring and her family

22:53.981 --> 22:57.027
have agreed to have
the dinner here

22:57.071 --> 22:59.247
tomorrow night.

23:00.248 --> 23:01.815
What wonderful news.

23:08.256 --> 23:09.823
Spock,

23:09.866 --> 23:11.912
are you all right?

23:11.955 --> 23:13.348
You look upset.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.263
I am not upset.

23:15.306 --> 23:17.961
I am merely experiencing...

23:18.005 --> 23:20.181
muscle spasms
from the accident.

23:20.224 --> 23:22.444
It's good that we're
doing this here, then,

23:22.488 --> 23:24.751
where you can be close
to your doctor.

23:24.794 --> 23:27.754
Now, we must discuss
the V'Shal rituals.

23:27.797 --> 23:29.408
There are three of them,

23:29.451 --> 23:31.148
and with T'Pring's mother,

23:31.192 --> 23:33.629
there is no room for error.

23:33.673 --> 23:35.544
I'm afraid the muscle spasms
are getting worse.

23:35.588 --> 23:39.374
Uh, perhaps we should,
uh, go to sickbay.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.072
Or perhaps we should just
tell them we can't do it.

23:42.116 --> 23:44.640
Spock, I'm afraid that
simply isn't logical.

23:44.684 --> 23:46.337
I don't care about logic.

23:46.381 --> 23:48.818
I was in an accident
and I'm in absolutely no state

23:48.862 --> 23:50.385
to possibly do this dinner.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.996
What part of that
do you not understand, Mother?

23:56.391 --> 23:58.349
Take off your hat.

24:04.965 --> 24:08.359
Spock, you're human.

24:08.403 --> 24:10.187
Hi, Mom.

24:10.231 --> 24:12.581
And you're sure there is no way
to revert him back...

24:12.625 --> 24:14.278
Our people are working on it,
but there's no guarantee

24:14.322 --> 24:16.150
they'll be able to do it
before the dinner.

24:16.193 --> 24:18.500
So we have to postpone.

24:18.544 --> 24:20.459
These rituals
have to go perfectly,

24:20.502 --> 24:22.373
and clearly I'm not
Vulcan enough to pull that off.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.985
The situation between
our two families

24:25.028 --> 24:27.422
is more tense than you realize.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.685
T'Pring's mother
is already skittish

24:29.729 --> 24:33.167
about the union because of me.

24:33.210 --> 24:34.908
You never told me this.
Why You?

24:34.951 --> 24:37.737
T'Pring's father values
a connection to Sarek,

24:37.780 --> 24:39.739
which is why he agreed.

24:39.782 --> 24:42.742
Her mother, on the other hand,
is proud,

24:42.785 --> 24:44.744
and not overly fond of humans,

24:44.787 --> 24:48.182
and would be all too happy
for any excuse to back out.

24:48.225 --> 24:50.227
Don't you think discovering
her future son-in-law

24:50.271 --> 24:51.664
is fully human
would be that excuse?

24:51.707 --> 24:53.579
Ho-Hold on,
are we really talking about

24:53.622 --> 24:55.145
the end of their engagement

24:55.189 --> 24:57.670
just because Spock
is temporarily not Vulcan?

24:57.713 --> 25:01.195
Vulcan engagements are complex.
If the agreement's

25:01.238 --> 25:03.284
broken, the union
won't be recognized

25:03.327 --> 25:04.546
under Vulcan law.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.461
T'Pring's family
would reject her

25:06.505 --> 25:09.203
if she chose
to remain with Spock.

25:09.246 --> 25:11.510
It's considered a great shame,

25:11.553 --> 25:13.512
and no choice at all
for a true Vulcan.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.514
So what are our actual
options here?

25:15.557 --> 25:17.211
I pretend to be Vulcan?

25:17.254 --> 25:20.997
-I couldn't even fool you.
-Well, a mother knows.

25:21.041 --> 25:24.435
Plus, you aren't
a practiced liar.

25:24.479 --> 25:25.872
Yet.

25:27.047 --> 25:29.397
Mother,

25:29.440 --> 25:31.312
are you honestly suggesting...

25:31.355 --> 25:32.966
I'm going to do
what I should have done

25:33.009 --> 25:34.489
many years ago.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.448
I'm gonna teach you
about your human side.

25:37.492 --> 25:40.234
I'm gonna show you how to lie.

25:42.845 --> 25:44.630
With the Captain's help,
of course.

25:44.673 --> 25:45.892
Do I have a choice
in the matter?

25:45.935 --> 25:46.980
You do not.

25:49.635 --> 25:52.594
First, we have to make you
look Vulcan.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.378
We couldn't do it genetically,

25:54.422 --> 25:56.946
as it might affect the cure
Nurse Chapel is rendering,

25:56.990 --> 25:59.209
so we made these instead.

26:03.649 --> 26:05.085
AMANDA:
The V'Shal ritual

26:05.128 --> 26:08.001
starts with the family tea.

26:08.044 --> 26:11.831
Spock, you must make
their family's recipe

26:11.874 --> 26:14.311
and serve it.

26:14.355 --> 26:15.661
That doesn't seem so hard.

26:15.704 --> 26:17.010
That would be the handling

26:17.053 --> 26:18.620
of a traditional Vulcan teapot.

26:28.674 --> 26:29.936
That's scalding hot.

26:29.979 --> 26:32.416
To a Vulcan,
it would be painless.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.640
How did you...

26:38.684 --> 26:40.990
One thing I've learned
about being

26:41.034 --> 26:43.471
a human on Vulcan

26:43.514 --> 26:47.214
is how to suppress my own pain.

26:51.392 --> 26:53.524
How to speak like a Vulcan.

26:53.568 --> 26:57.441
Like this. Flat.
No emotion.

26:57.485 --> 26:59.661
I am Vulcan.

26:59.705 --> 27:02.403
[deep voice]:
Flatter. More robotic.

27:02.446 --> 27:04.100
I am Vulcan.

27:04.144 --> 27:06.146
I love logic.

27:06.189 --> 27:09.628
Notice how I move my eyebrow

27:09.671 --> 27:13.414
but no other muscles in my face.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.111
Mm.

27:15.155 --> 27:17.070
Do I really sound like that?

27:17.113 --> 27:18.767
ALL:
Yes.

27:18.811 --> 27:19.768
Absolutely.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.552
The Ritual of Awareness.

27:21.596 --> 27:23.250
When a young couple
is made aware

27:23.293 --> 27:25.556
of all of their faults
and their flaws.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.516
Right, so he just
has to keep his cool.

27:28.559 --> 27:31.084
While the timer counts down,

27:31.127 --> 27:33.347
T'Pring's parents will tell you

27:33.390 --> 27:37.612
all of the things they think
that you are doing wrong.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.353
They might,
for instance, ask you

27:39.396 --> 27:41.616
how you plan on
having a future together

27:41.660 --> 27:43.270
when you spend months
apart from each other.

27:43.313 --> 27:45.359
Are you kidding?

27:45.402 --> 27:47.578
-You're going there already?
-ORTEGAS: Spock.

27:47.622 --> 27:49.232
She hasn't even started.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.061
Sorry.

27:52.105 --> 27:54.934
The last ritual: the Mind Meld.

27:54.977 --> 27:57.458
You and I will share
a memory of your childhood,

27:57.501 --> 27:59.199
or at least pretend to.

28:02.028 --> 28:04.117
My mind to your mind.

28:04.160 --> 28:07.903
My thoughts to your thoughts.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.383
Don't grit your teeth
like that.

28:09.426 --> 28:12.038
Try pretending maybe
you're seeing something,

28:12.081 --> 28:13.213
like memories.

28:13.256 --> 28:15.650
You look constipated.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.739
I'm trying to pretend
I'm seeing her memories.

28:17.783 --> 28:21.090
Perhaps don't try as hard. Hmm?

28:24.790 --> 28:29.490
My mind to your mind.
My thoughts to your thoughts.

28:29.533 --> 28:30.839
-Geez, now you seem kinda pushy.
-She's right.

28:30.883 --> 28:32.493
I don't know what you all
want from me.

28:32.536 --> 28:34.277
I don't see her memories
and it's weird.

28:34.321 --> 28:37.237
I'm used to seeing them.
I don't know how to fake it.

28:39.979 --> 28:43.678
I don't think that
we're gonna be able

28:43.722 --> 28:45.288
to pull this off.

28:45.332 --> 28:47.247
What are you talking about?
This was your idea.

28:47.290 --> 28:49.292
Yes, I realize that.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.381
But in order for it
to look real,

28:51.425 --> 28:53.862
it must be real.

28:53.906 --> 28:55.342
And T'Pril is gonna
see that it isn't.

28:55.385 --> 28:58.519
Even your friends can sense it.

28:58.562 --> 29:01.391
Then we'd better hope that
Dr. M'Benga and Nurse Chapel

29:01.435 --> 29:04.351
can come up with a cure
before we get to the mind meld.

29:07.180 --> 29:09.573
-M'BENGA:
Problem with the modeling?
-Big problem.

29:09.617 --> 29:11.575
The Vulcan genome is failing

29:11.619 --> 29:13.055
to replace
the duplicated human copy.

29:13.099 --> 29:15.057
Did you use
pseudosynapsis treatments

29:15.101 --> 29:17.190
-to inject a time delay
into his...
-Yes.

29:17.233 --> 29:18.800
Yes, I'm way ahead of you.

29:18.844 --> 29:20.497
The problem
isn't the time delay.

29:20.541 --> 29:22.238
The problem
is histone unspooling.

29:22.282 --> 29:25.241
The models are telling me
we have 24 hours.

29:25.285 --> 29:27.243
After that, the cells lose
all genetic plasticity.

29:27.287 --> 29:29.419
Oh, dear.

29:29.463 --> 29:32.727
If we can't change him back
he's gonna be stuck like this.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.251
Perhaps Federation standard gene
therapy isn't robust enough.

29:35.295 --> 29:37.253
I have some more
experimental techniques

29:37.297 --> 29:38.820
I've pulled from the Trinar.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.343
No, Trinarregression
won't work.

29:40.387 --> 29:42.432
None of your experimental
techniques will work.

29:42.476 --> 29:44.521
I've been through everything
you keep back there.

29:44.565 --> 29:46.132
We can't do it.

29:46.175 --> 29:48.134
Christine, you can't lose hope.

29:48.177 --> 29:50.136
No, listen to me.

29:50.179 --> 29:51.833
We can't do it,

29:51.877 --> 29:53.835
but we already know who can

29:53.879 --> 29:55.706
because they did it before.

29:55.750 --> 29:57.491
The Kerkhovians.

29:57.534 --> 30:00.015
But how are you
possibly going to...

30:00.059 --> 30:02.322
I can be very persuasive.

30:02.365 --> 30:05.325
You want me to fly the three
of us to another dimension

30:05.368 --> 30:07.501
so you can talk
with some ancient aliens?

30:07.544 --> 30:10.112
No. I want you to fly us
adjacent to another dimension

30:10.156 --> 30:12.462
so we can send a signal
to some ancient aliens.

30:13.463 --> 30:15.204
I think it could work.

30:15.248 --> 30:17.250
I mean, the data chip
stopped functioning,

30:17.293 --> 30:19.556
but I think
if we fly close enough

30:19.600 --> 30:21.950
to the anomaly,
we could use its ambient energy

30:21.994 --> 30:23.691
to route a signal through.

30:23.734 --> 30:25.562
And the captain
actually okayed this?

30:25.606 --> 30:29.001
'Cause last time we sent
a shuttle there, it crashed.

30:29.044 --> 30:31.046
If we don't do this now,

30:31.090 --> 30:33.832
Spock is going
to be stuck like this.

30:33.875 --> 30:37.836
I was in that crash with him,
and I survived,

30:37.879 --> 30:41.404
while he... was changed.

30:42.884 --> 30:46.192
If there is a way to save him,
I have to try.

30:53.982 --> 30:55.418
Could we get these
to go, please?

31:08.127 --> 31:10.172
♪

31:14.524 --> 31:16.135
Are you ready to do this?

31:16.178 --> 31:18.137
T'Pring will arrive first.

31:18.180 --> 31:20.139
I will walk her
to the captain's quarters

31:20.182 --> 31:21.792
and let her know
what's going on.

31:21.836 --> 31:23.620
And I will delay
T'Pril and Sevet

31:23.664 --> 31:25.796
for as long as I can
to give you more time.

31:31.193 --> 31:32.978
It's gonna be okay.

31:33.021 --> 31:34.631
Will it?

31:34.675 --> 31:36.372
Yes.

31:37.634 --> 31:40.159
Then... energize.

31:44.815 --> 31:47.209
T'Pring, parted from me...

31:47.253 --> 31:50.560
Spock, I have spent the last
two days with my mother.

31:50.604 --> 31:53.737
I can stomach
no more formalities.

31:53.781 --> 31:56.305
I... understand.

31:57.306 --> 31:59.091
It is good to see you.

31:59.134 --> 32:02.572
You look strange.

32:02.616 --> 32:04.487
This is not a good time
to change your hair.

32:04.531 --> 32:07.838
Amanda, thank you
for being here.

32:07.882 --> 32:09.710
Of course.

32:09.753 --> 32:12.017
I gather T'Pril
is being her usual self?

32:12.060 --> 32:15.542
Yes.
It is... challenging.

32:15.585 --> 32:19.067
Allow me to greet them
for you, then.

32:20.068 --> 32:22.636
Shall we go?

32:26.945 --> 32:29.034
[door whooshes open]

32:30.600 --> 32:33.125
Before the ritual, there
is a matter we must discuss.

32:33.168 --> 32:34.996
It pertains to your mother.

32:35.040 --> 32:39.261
Must we? She has already
taken up a great deal of space

32:39.305 --> 32:42.308
and later I must
share my mind with her.

32:43.962 --> 32:47.226
I know how much you have
sacrificed, being with her.

32:47.269 --> 32:49.750
She has been particularly
difficult lately.

32:49.793 --> 32:52.318
We debated for three hours

32:52.361 --> 32:54.973
over this outfit.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.933
That is...

32:58.977 --> 33:00.674
fascinating?

33:00.717 --> 33:02.893
I suppose it is,

33:02.937 --> 33:04.983
in the way that
it is fascinating

33:05.026 --> 33:06.593
that some species
eat their young.

33:06.636 --> 33:08.595
[snorts]

33:08.638 --> 33:09.683
[clears throat]

33:09.726 --> 33:11.424
[coughs]

33:11.467 --> 33:13.426
I am sorry.

33:13.469 --> 33:15.210
I was choking.

33:15.254 --> 33:16.907
You must be more careful.

33:16.951 --> 33:18.953
If anything goes wrong,

33:18.997 --> 33:21.564
T'Pril will use it
to end our engagement.

33:21.608 --> 33:24.219
She would actually do that?

33:24.263 --> 33:26.265
Oh, Spock,

33:26.308 --> 33:27.918
you have no idea.

33:29.050 --> 33:31.270
Now, what is it
that you wanted to tell me?

33:35.056 --> 33:36.536
Just...

33:36.579 --> 33:38.146
that I will do my best

33:38.190 --> 33:40.235
to ensure everything
goes as planned.

34:11.788 --> 34:13.703
These quarters seem
quite comfortable.

34:13.746 --> 34:15.835
They will suit our needs
for the V'Shal ritual.

34:15.879 --> 34:17.838
They are merely adequate,

34:17.880 --> 34:20.536
and they carry
an unfortunate odor.

34:20.580 --> 34:22.625
I am afraid she's right.

34:22.668 --> 34:24.888
I did not notice it before.

34:24.931 --> 34:28.022
Vulcan women are
more sensitive to odors.

34:28.065 --> 34:30.024
Is that not true, T'Pring?

34:30.068 --> 34:32.286
Yes, Mother.

34:32.331 --> 34:34.985
I can smell it, too.

34:35.029 --> 34:37.074
We all know what it is.

34:38.206 --> 34:41.688
Your house on Vulcan
would surely have been finer,

34:41.731 --> 34:44.560
but due to Spock's injuries,
we are grateful

34:44.603 --> 34:47.259
for your understanding
in the change in venue.

34:47.302 --> 34:50.000
Yes.
His injuries.

34:50.043 --> 34:51.958
What exactly is wrong with him?

34:52.002 --> 34:56.137
We have not had time
to discuss the accident.

34:56.181 --> 34:58.096
Spock?

34:59.967 --> 35:02.622
I was in a shuttle accident.
There was...

35:02.665 --> 35:05.015
extensive nerve damage.

35:05.059 --> 35:06.800
And also,

35:06.843 --> 35:08.802
my eyebrows were singed.

35:08.845 --> 35:12.762
Oh, yes, when you look closely,

35:12.806 --> 35:14.721
you can see...

35:14.764 --> 35:16.331
they have been altered.

35:20.379 --> 35:23.033
Captain Pike spent all night
working on Vulcan specialties.

35:23.077 --> 35:24.861
Yes.

35:24.905 --> 35:27.429
I made traditional tevmel

35:27.473 --> 35:29.344
-for the occasion.
-SEVET: Oh!

35:32.695 --> 35:34.175
These are delicious.

35:34.219 --> 35:37.744
But one could hardly
call them traditional.

35:37.787 --> 35:40.964
Mm. That is true.

35:41.008 --> 35:43.619
They have diverged
from tradition a bit.

35:43.663 --> 35:45.882
The twist is far too elaborate,

35:45.926 --> 35:48.494
the halak is not fresh,
and it seems to be...

35:48.537 --> 35:51.192
[sniffs]
...salted.

35:51.236 --> 35:55.109
I... did not realize.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.416
Well, I used salt
to slow fermentation

35:57.459 --> 36:00.114
since the-the starship
runs at a hotter temperature

36:00.158 --> 36:02.682
than your typical
Vulcan kitchen, so...

36:02.725 --> 36:04.205
A clever adaptation.

36:04.249 --> 36:05.946
Perhaps you just
need more practice.

36:08.470 --> 36:11.517
It is late.
We must begin the ritual.

36:11.560 --> 36:14.302
Uh, m-must we?
I-I still have

36:14.346 --> 36:16.217
a great deal more
Vulcan food to serve.

36:16.261 --> 36:17.392
Oh, really?

36:18.567 --> 36:21.048
That is,
I am sure it can wait.

36:22.528 --> 36:25.574
T'Pring, would you not
prefer to eat more?

36:25.618 --> 36:28.011
I am not hungry.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.853
COMPUTER:
Gravitational anomaly detected.

36:43.897 --> 36:46.334
Any luck patching in our call?

36:46.378 --> 36:49.424
I'm trying, but there's too
much gravimetric interference

36:49.468 --> 36:51.252
to connect through the rift.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.559
Would it help
if we moved closer?

36:53.602 --> 36:56.039
It would, but...

36:56.083 --> 36:57.693
Closer?
To the gravitational anomaly

36:57.737 --> 36:59.129
that nearly killed
you and Spock?

36:59.173 --> 37:00.870
Sure, that's a...
that's a great idea.

37:00.914 --> 37:02.350
Please?

37:06.485 --> 37:09.357
I could probably
get a little closer.

37:15.624 --> 37:17.583
I see the problem.

37:17.626 --> 37:20.760
There's a distortion field
blocking us.

37:20.803 --> 37:22.762
I think if we could
wedge ourselves in the door,

37:22.805 --> 37:24.807
I might be able
to thread a signal through.

37:24.851 --> 37:27.462
-Wedge ourselves in the door?
-That is not

37:27.506 --> 37:30.465
possible. Gravitational shearing
would tear the ship apart.

37:30.509 --> 37:32.772
UHURA:
Except, remember
what the Kerkhovian said?

37:32.815 --> 37:34.948
On the other side of that

37:34.991 --> 37:38.299
is some kind of...
transport tunnel.

37:38.343 --> 37:40.867
It's probably mostly empty.

37:40.910 --> 37:42.999
"Probably" is a lot to bet on.

37:43.043 --> 37:44.697
Think of the ocean in a storm.

37:44.740 --> 37:46.612
The surface
is moving like crazy,

37:46.655 --> 37:49.092
but when you get under it,
it's calm.

37:49.136 --> 37:51.356
Yeah, I hate analogies.
It is never really

37:51.399 --> 37:52.879
like you say it is.

37:53.967 --> 37:57.144
Look, I can't ask either of you
to risk your lives for this.

37:58.493 --> 38:01.191
But if there is a chance
to save Spock, I have to try.

38:03.150 --> 38:06.240
He didn't choose
to be like this.

38:07.328 --> 38:09.852
Should we even try to contact
Enterpriseabout this?

38:09.896 --> 38:11.419
I can't reach anything outside
a light-year's distance

38:11.463 --> 38:12.855
with all this interference.

38:12.899 --> 38:15.293
Like it or not, it's up to us.

38:16.337 --> 38:17.773
So, what--
I got to be the one

38:17.817 --> 38:19.340
to vote against
doing the crazy maneuver?

38:19.384 --> 38:21.342
Does that sound like me?

38:21.386 --> 38:23.126
So, we're doing this?

38:25.172 --> 38:27.392
We're doing this.

38:30.090 --> 38:32.135
Hold onto your butts.

You came to me.

40:54.190 --> 40:57.324
Right. Uh...

40:57.367 --> 40:58.847
We need your help.

My friend who, um,

41:00.980 --> 41:03.112

41:03.156 --> 41:05.375
-Remediated.
-remediated.

Only you didn't fix him
correctly, and I'm trying to,

Remediation was made.
No complaints were lodged.

41:13.122 --> 41:14.559
-Therefore, no...
-No. See,

41:14.602 --> 41:17.213
remediation was not made.
You messed him up.

41:17.257 --> 41:19.215
My friend, Spock-- you, um...

41:19.259 --> 41:21.217
you read
his instructions wrong,

41:21.261 --> 41:23.306
and you turned him
into something

41:23.350 --> 41:25.221
that he's not.

41:25.265 --> 41:27.093
And now,
if I don't get your help,

41:27.136 --> 41:29.051
we won't be able
to turn him back ever again.

41:29.095 --> 41:32.098

This is irregular. A complaint

41:35.754 --> 41:38.321
Could we maybe
speak to Yellow, please?

Thank you, Amanda.

I am grateful for any awareness
you provide me.

41:56.601 --> 41:59.734
T'Pring, you could visit more.

41:59.778 --> 42:01.344
[T'Pril clears throat]

42:02.694 --> 42:05.653
AMANDA:
And you could have
more self-confidence.

42:05.697 --> 42:09.048
Have I not said the same to her?

42:09.091 --> 42:11.659
This is not satisfactory.

42:11.703 --> 42:14.183
T'Pril is very good
at creating awareness.

42:14.227 --> 42:17.709
T'Pring knows how I feel.

42:17.752 --> 42:19.972
I did not wish
to be needlessly cruel.

42:20.015 --> 42:22.931
Your human instincts
are fighting the very purpose

42:22.975 --> 42:24.846
of this ritual.

42:24.890 --> 42:28.589
A Vulcan, logically,
wants to improve.

42:28.633 --> 42:30.809
We make them aware.

42:30.852 --> 42:32.724
You are being too timid.

42:34.595 --> 42:35.553
Thank you, Mother.

42:37.511 --> 42:41.384
I am grateful for
any awareness you provide me.

42:41.428 --> 42:43.386
You are already aware
of all the ways

42:43.430 --> 42:45.606
in which you could do better.

42:45.650 --> 42:47.477
But Spock is not.

42:47.521 --> 42:51.177
I am grateful for any awareness
you provide me, T'Pril.

42:54.876 --> 42:58.619
Spock, you are a disappointment.

42:58.663 --> 43:02.492
You have turned your back
on your planet,

43:02.536 --> 43:04.756
your people, your family

43:04.799 --> 43:06.366
and our daughter.

43:06.409 --> 43:08.498
While many Vulcan men
would stand willingly

43:08.542 --> 43:10.500
at T'Pring's side,

43:10.544 --> 43:13.068
you abandon her
for months on end.

43:13.112 --> 43:15.201
Thank you, T'Pril, for...

43:15.244 --> 43:17.159
I am not finished.

43:17.203 --> 43:19.335
You disrespect your family name,

43:19.379 --> 43:21.947
choosing Starfleet
over all else.

43:21.990 --> 43:25.037
Your father, Sarek,
is correct to shut you out.

43:25.080 --> 43:27.300
To not embrace your choices.

43:27.343 --> 43:29.650
It is only logical to conclude
that you have failed him

43:29.694 --> 43:31.957
as a Vulcan and as a son.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.002
You simply do not deserve
our daughter.

Mother.

43:50.845 --> 43:54.283
I must... use the bathroom.

43:58.113 --> 44:00.942

a more resilient bladder.

We've hit a roadblock.

44:38.066 --> 44:39.764
Nurse Chapel went
to find the Kerkhovians.

44:39.807 --> 44:42.114
She what?

44:42.157 --> 44:43.898
And you just let her go?

44:43.942 --> 44:46.205
You and I both know that
when Christine

44:46.248 --> 44:48.947
sets her mind to something,
she is hard to stop.

44:48.990 --> 44:51.079
Do you know where she is now?

44:59.566 --> 45:01.611
Hello. I am Yellow.

45:01.655 --> 45:04.005
Yes. Yes, uh,

45:04.049 --> 45:06.094
I'm trying to find some help
for my friend Spock.

45:06.138 --> 45:08.793
YELLOW:
Remediation was made.
No further contact is...

45:08.836 --> 45:11.752
No, we... I know you think
we shouldn't contact you,

45:11.796 --> 45:14.494
but you made a mistake,
and we need your help to fix it.

45:14.537 --> 45:17.584
YELLOW:
A complaint outside of the
response period is irregular.

45:17.627 --> 45:20.239
What is your relationship
to this being?

45:20.282 --> 45:23.111
Oh. Um... he's my friend.

45:23.155 --> 45:25.113
YELLOW:
Friends are not
allowed complaints

45:25.157 --> 45:28.987
-outside of the response period.
-What? Why not?

45:34.340 --> 45:36.864
YELLOW:
Because they do not have
sufficient connection

45:36.908 --> 45:38.866
to the being in question.

45:38.910 --> 45:42.783
Uh, but... friends are different
in our world.

45:42.827 --> 45:45.612
We... we care about them.

45:45.655 --> 45:48.049
YELLOW:
You are each other's...
caregivers?

45:48.093 --> 45:49.529
No.

45:49.572 --> 45:51.879
Well, sort of.

45:51.923 --> 45:53.620
YELLOW:
This would answer
a question we had.

45:53.663 --> 45:55.578
During the accident,

45:55.622 --> 45:57.798
the other being diverted
the shields away from himself

45:57.842 --> 45:59.887
to protect you.

45:59.931 --> 46:01.323
He what?

46:06.851 --> 46:08.809
YELLOW:
He chose to protect you,

46:08.853 --> 46:11.290
at the risk of his own life.

46:12.944 --> 46:14.249
So...

46:15.598 --> 46:17.470
...can you explain?

46:17.513 --> 46:19.472
What is your relationship
to this being?

46:19.515 --> 46:21.430
I don't know.

46:21.474 --> 46:23.041
Oh, my God. Christine, come on.

46:23.084 --> 46:26.174
Seriously, you do know.
Tell them.

46:26.218 --> 46:28.046
Tell them what?
I don't know what to say.

46:28.089 --> 46:31.310
Tell them you like Spock,
that you have feelings for him.

46:31.353 --> 46:33.312
Are you so obtuse
that you don't even see that?

46:33.355 --> 46:36.228
-It's complicated.
-UHURA: Then make it simple.

46:36.271 --> 46:38.491
Because if you don't,

46:38.534 --> 46:40.319
he'll never be like
how he was again.

46:40.362 --> 46:42.408
Okay?

46:46.020 --> 46:48.544
-Oh.
-[sighs]

46:49.545 --> 46:51.286
Spock is...

46:53.027 --> 46:55.290
He's my friend.

46:57.249 --> 46:59.207
And...

46:59.251 --> 47:01.340
maybe sometimes,

47:01.383 --> 47:04.691
I wish that we had...

47:04.734 --> 47:06.998
more...

47:07.041 --> 47:08.521
connection.

47:08.564 --> 47:10.871
But when you healed him,

47:10.915 --> 47:12.351
you changed him.

47:13.569 --> 47:16.790
You made him, um,
easier to talk to,

47:16.834 --> 47:20.098
someone who probably, um...

47:20.141 --> 47:22.535
understands my feelings
a little better.

47:23.797 --> 47:25.233
But, um...

47:28.019 --> 47:29.455
...it's not him.

47:29.498 --> 47:31.370
At least,

47:31.413 --> 47:33.154
it's not all of him because

47:33.198 --> 47:36.201
you took away the other part,

47:36.244 --> 47:37.898
a part that I was connected to.

47:39.857 --> 47:43.121
And I miss him... as he was.

47:45.036 --> 47:47.777
Can you please
help put him back?

T'PRIL:
Spock,

47:54.349 --> 47:56.351
the time has come
for the mind meld.

47:57.962 --> 48:00.312
Spock,

48:00.355 --> 48:02.096
are you all right?

48:02.140 --> 48:04.925
Uh, before the next ritual,
I'd like to interject.

48:04.969 --> 48:06.753
Uh, hi. Uh,

48:06.796 --> 48:09.103
as a nod to Spock's
human heritage,

48:09.147 --> 48:11.453
uh, uh, an Earth tradition

48:11.497 --> 48:15.327
that I believe would greatly...
deepen the ceremony.

48:15.370 --> 48:18.373
Yes, uh, uh,
it's the very important...

48:18.417 --> 48:20.941
Earth tradition of...

48:20.985 --> 48:22.116
Ch-Charades.

48:23.639 --> 48:27.426
I understand this is a union
of different cultures,

48:27.469 --> 48:30.777
but must we interrupt our sacred
rituals to perform this...

48:30.820 --> 48:32.561
Charades is very important.

48:32.605 --> 48:35.564
I am afraid that we must.

48:35.608 --> 48:38.916
Captain, can you
explain the rules?

48:40.526 --> 48:42.963
Traditionally, uh, charades--

48:43.007 --> 48:45.966
well, it's-it's played
in two teams.

48:46.010 --> 48:47.837
-Each team is given a word.
-SEVET: What sort of word?

48:47.881 --> 48:49.317
A sacred word?

48:49.361 --> 48:51.232
Yeah.

48:51.276 --> 48:53.017
[door chimes]

48:57.804 --> 49:00.720
Mr. Spock,
I have your vitamins.

49:02.983 --> 49:04.506
Apologies.

49:04.550 --> 49:07.814
This is part of my treatment
for my injuries.

49:12.166 --> 49:14.952
Please, continue.

49:16.475 --> 49:19.217
PIKE:
Uh, so if the sacred word
has two

49:19.260 --> 49:21.088
sacred syllables, uh, I'd, uh,

49:21.132 --> 49:22.872
I'd go, "First syllable,
sounds like."

49:22.916 --> 49:24.396
Ear.

49:30.706 --> 49:34.188
Uh, the Vulcan genome should
start coming back immediately,

49:34.232 --> 49:36.364
and physical changes
may take a couple hours.

49:36.408 --> 49:40.368
I'm glad to see you're okay.
I was worried about you.

49:42.283 --> 49:44.285
Why did you do it?

49:44.329 --> 49:46.461
On the shuttle,

49:46.505 --> 49:48.855
you moved the shields
to save my life.

49:49.856 --> 49:51.597
I...

49:51.640 --> 49:54.469
It was the logical choice.

49:54.513 --> 49:57.037
As a Vulcan, I had
a higher likelihood of survival.

49:57.081 --> 49:58.604
Just logical, huh?

50:00.606 --> 50:03.043
Christine,

50:03.087 --> 50:05.393
I feel many things.

50:05.437 --> 50:07.352
It's confusing.

50:09.658 --> 50:12.183
Yeah, I know.
For me, too.

50:12.226 --> 50:14.272
[sighs]

50:17.318 --> 50:19.103
I have to tell you...

50:26.284 --> 50:27.633
Get back out there.

50:27.676 --> 50:29.461
You have people waiting.

50:54.964 --> 50:58.272
Spock, what memory did
your mother share with you?

50:59.621 --> 51:01.667
An ordinary day.

51:01.710 --> 51:03.799
One in which
she took me to school.

51:03.843 --> 51:05.975
This seems rather mundane.

51:06.019 --> 51:09.501
Mother, it is illogical

51:09.544 --> 51:12.025
to criticize the nature
of a memory.

51:12.069 --> 51:13.896
The ritual has been completed.

51:13.940 --> 51:17.335
Your assessment is not required.

51:17.378 --> 51:20.599
Only your acknowledgement
of the conclusion of the dinner.

51:23.819 --> 51:25.865
It is acknowledged.

51:27.910 --> 51:29.782
Do we have any more
of that tevmel?

51:30.957 --> 51:32.915
I had my doubts, Spock,

51:32.959 --> 51:35.918
but despite many faults
beyond your control,

51:35.962 --> 51:38.530
you have completed the required
steps of our agreement.

51:38.573 --> 51:40.532
Thank you, T'Pril.

51:40.575 --> 51:43.317
That must have been
very difficult for you to say.

51:44.405 --> 51:47.365
Many faults beyond my control.

51:47.408 --> 51:49.889
Your Vulcan nature is diluted.

51:49.932 --> 51:53.458
So it must have been challenging
to hold on to your logical side.

51:53.501 --> 51:55.503
I am impressed
that you achieved this,

51:55.547 --> 51:56.983
despite your...

51:57.026 --> 51:58.724
handicap.

51:58.767 --> 52:01.292
SPOCK:
Because it would
have been impossible

52:01.335 --> 52:04.512
for a human to have gone through
this ritual successfully?

52:04.556 --> 52:06.297
Without question.

52:06.340 --> 52:08.603
What are you doing?

52:09.648 --> 52:12.781
So, it must be
a great embarrassment to know

52:12.825 --> 52:14.783
that this entire ritual
was performed

52:14.827 --> 52:17.003
by a human, not a Vulcan.

52:17.046 --> 52:20.006
SEVET:
Is this part of charades?

52:20.049 --> 52:23.531
How many syllables
did this human use?

52:23.575 --> 52:27.056
Sevet, I am the human.

52:36.414 --> 52:38.155
Spock.

52:40.244 --> 52:42.855
SPOCK:
You refer to my human side
as a handicap.

52:42.898 --> 52:45.858
Yet my mother
is the most resilient,

52:45.901 --> 52:48.861
compassionate, tolerant person
I have known.

52:48.904 --> 52:52.212
One who has been judged
by Vulcans her entire life.

52:54.301 --> 52:57.043
And yet she stands by--
for love,

52:57.086 --> 53:00.307
for family, for me.

53:02.309 --> 53:03.789
That is no handicap.

53:03.832 --> 53:05.443
That is true strength.

53:07.096 --> 53:09.273
And I am sorry
that it has taken until now

53:09.316 --> 53:11.449
for me to speak
these words to you.

53:11.492 --> 53:14.539
Thank you, Spock.

53:30.772 --> 53:34.428
I am confused that
you did not feel comfortable

53:34.472 --> 53:37.997
telling your own fiancée
about your condition.

53:39.303 --> 53:42.784
I felt that, given how difficult
it is for Vulcans to lie,

53:42.828 --> 53:45.134
to leave you out of it
was more logical.

53:45.178 --> 53:47.267
We have been through
so much together.

53:47.311 --> 53:50.096
We have shared katras.

53:50.139 --> 53:51.967
And yet...

53:52.011 --> 53:55.362
Was there no point at which you
even considered letting me know?

53:55.406 --> 53:57.364
In the heat
of my human emotions,

53:57.408 --> 53:59.192
I did not want to burden you.

53:59.236 --> 54:01.412
You seemed overwhelmed
by your mother.

54:01.455 --> 54:04.371
While there is logic to what
you say,

54:04.415 --> 54:06.112
I should also note

54:06.155 --> 54:08.941
that you seem to have involved
nearly everyone else

54:08.984 --> 54:11.465
on this ship in your ruse.

54:11.509 --> 54:14.207
How am I meant to feel?

54:14.251 --> 54:17.166
I have told you before
that I accept you,

54:17.210 --> 54:19.952
human side and all.

54:19.995 --> 54:21.997
But it would seem
that despite this,

54:22.041 --> 54:24.435
and all that
we have been through,

54:24.478 --> 54:27.525
you still do not trust me.

54:27.568 --> 54:30.397
T'Pring,

54:30.441 --> 54:32.573
I did not mean to...

54:32.617 --> 54:34.445
I should have...

54:34.488 --> 54:38.318
Perhaps it would be best
if we took time apart.

54:42.583 --> 54:43.715
[door whooshes open]

54:43.758 --> 54:45.673
VARAL:
Miss Chapel.

54:45.717 --> 54:47.545
I am calling to let you know
that we have chosen

54:47.588 --> 54:50.025
not to offer you a fellowship.

54:50.069 --> 54:52.289
You are welcome to apply again
if you decide that

54:52.332 --> 54:54.421
is an appropriate use
of your time.

54:55.944 --> 54:58.164
I went to interdimensional
space today.

54:59.208 --> 55:01.776
I do not see
how that is relevant.

55:01.820 --> 55:04.866
I encountered a species that
hasn't interacted with humans

55:04.910 --> 55:08.087
or Vulcans for centuries.

55:08.130 --> 55:10.350
I convinced them

55:10.394 --> 55:12.526
to help me

55:12.570 --> 55:14.354
with an ancient
medical procedure.

55:15.660 --> 55:18.358
What sort of medical procedure?

55:18.402 --> 55:19.925
You can read about it
in my paper

55:19.968 --> 55:21.492
when it comes out
later this year.

55:22.493 --> 55:25.757
I would consider
applying again,

55:25.800 --> 55:28.586
but, you know, the truth is...

55:29.978 --> 55:32.633
...I don't think
your fellowship is ready for me.

55:37.377 --> 55:40.772
So, as you can see, Captain,

55:40.815 --> 55:43.383
it has been quite a day.

55:44.819 --> 55:47.735
Spock...

55:47.779 --> 55:49.998
can I offer you one more
human ritual that I find

55:50.042 --> 55:52.000
helps at moments like these?

55:52.044 --> 55:54.176
What is it called?

55:54.220 --> 55:57.658
Commiseration.

56:04.796 --> 56:07.233
Mother,

56:07.276 --> 56:09.322
the memory you chose--

56:09.366 --> 56:12.847
the first time Vulcan children
asked me to play with them--

56:12.891 --> 56:15.067
why did you choose it?

56:16.329 --> 56:18.940
Because it was the first time

56:18.984 --> 56:21.290
I saw that you felt accepted.

56:22.814 --> 56:24.511
Only, seeing it
through your eyes,

56:24.555 --> 56:27.906
I realize now
that you were not.

56:27.949 --> 56:29.908
You were shunned
by Vulcan mothers.

56:29.951 --> 56:32.476
But you were happy, and their

56:32.519 --> 56:34.260
judgement was a sign

56:34.303 --> 56:37.481
of their own weakness, not ours.

56:37.524 --> 56:40.919
And yet I see now
what you gave up.

56:40.962 --> 56:44.401
What you chose to live through,
as a human on Vulcan.

56:44.444 --> 56:46.315
I feel it.

56:48.274 --> 56:50.798
I have spent
my entire life so focused

56:50.842 --> 56:54.062
on finding my path as a Vulcan,
I failed to see your journey.

56:57.326 --> 56:59.459
It is not easy,

56:59.503 --> 57:02.506
being a human
who loves a Vulcan.

57:28.836 --> 57:30.403
I was just on my way to see you.

57:30.447 --> 57:31.970
I'm here.

57:33.101 --> 57:34.799
What were you coming
to see me about?

57:41.936 --> 57:43.460
[door whooshes closed]

57:45.592 --> 57:48.769
To tell you that T'Pring and I
have decided to take time apart.

57:51.250 --> 57:53.687
How do you feel about that?

57:53.731 --> 57:55.733
I feel badly.

57:58.344 --> 57:59.867
But also...

58:00.868 --> 58:03.088
...it was necessary.

58:05.220 --> 58:08.702
I am conflicted because I have
feelings for someone else.

58:08.746 --> 58:11.226
A Vulcan with feelings?

58:11.270 --> 58:13.228
We have them.

58:13.272 --> 58:15.492
They are more powerful than
human feelings, which is why

58:15.535 --> 58:18.364
we suppress them.

58:18.407 --> 58:21.498
I don't want
to suppress this one any longer.

58:22.803 --> 58:25.414
I want to feel this.

58:29.375 --> 58:31.420
What did you come here f...

58:48.916 --> 58:50.222
What does this mean?

58:50.265 --> 58:52.441
I don't know.
Shut up.
