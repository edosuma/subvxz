WEBVTT

00:52.928 --> 00:55.055
Life hasn't always been smooth for me.

00:57.266 --> 01:00.936
You know, parents that didn't care,
homeless by 17.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.941
Then cooking saved me.

01:08.819 --> 01:13.031
Taught me how to treat myself.
How to treat others.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.496
I've learned it doesn't matter
where you've been.

01:21.707 --> 01:24.126
What matters is who you're feeding today.

01:28.130 --> 01:32.551
Food can lift you up,
and it can break your heart.

01:36.138 --> 01:38.307
So if you can't stand the heatâ€¦

01:39.975 --> 01:42.394
then get out of my fucking kitchen.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.196
We're so proud of you.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.947
That's your Dada.

01:54.031 --> 01:55.282
Sean, it's terrific.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.826
This is gonna change your life.

01:57.910 --> 01:58.911
I don't know.

01:58.994 --> 02:01.205
I don't think he had
enough faux exotic tattoos

02:01.288 --> 02:02.706
to be a real celebrity chef.

02:02.789 --> 02:07.878
No. Gourmet Gauntlet: Philadelphia will be
their most successful season in history.

02:08.836 --> 02:11.173
Everybody's gonna know
the name Sean Turner.

02:11.256 --> 02:15.135
Well, no matter what happens,
you were phenomenal,

02:15.886 --> 02:17.888
and we're all very excited for you.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.558
-Are you, Dorothy?
-What?

02:23.018 --> 02:24.019
Of course.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.231
It's time for Jericho's walk.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.567
Hey, you ready?

02:31.485 --> 02:34.821
Come on. Yeah. Yeah.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.783
You better not be suggesting
you're better than the Barefoot Contessa.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.284
She is a national treasure.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.955
So when you gonna introduce me
to Padma Lakshmi?

02:43.664 --> 02:45.082
I'm thinking never.

02:46.208 --> 02:47.251
And what about Ina Garten?

02:47.876 --> 02:49.419
This isn't the Food Network.

02:56.051 --> 02:59.972
So? I'm guessing there's a reason
you wanted to come out here sans Sean.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.683
I need you to stop fucking the nanny.

03:04.643 --> 03:07.646
I'm not in the mood,
so please don't try to deny it. Just stop.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.109
It's over, okay?

03:13.777 --> 03:15.654
What's this about, Dottie?

03:15.737 --> 03:16.947
Is it about work?

03:17.865 --> 03:19.950
You're just going through
a dry spell. It'll pass.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.411
Someone attacked her, Julian.

03:24.872 --> 03:25.873
Is she all right?

03:26.373 --> 03:28.208
Who knows? She says she is.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.587
I don't know much of anything anymore.

03:33.797 --> 03:38.427
I honestly cannot remember
Sean being on Gourmet Gauntlet last year.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.763
Feel like I'm losing my mind.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.849
But you were under
a hell of a lot of stress.

03:44.600 --> 03:45.601
It's fine.

03:46.977 --> 03:50.606
I lost some things in the postpartum fog.
I guess that's life.

03:52.733 --> 03:56.945
Just stay away from Leanne.
She's hard enough to handle as is.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.781
I have to figure out what to do with her.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.368
I will not have that cult
back in our lives.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.254
Leanne, I--

04:15.714 --> 04:18.716
You know I want you to feel free
to come and go as you please,

04:18.800 --> 04:21.053
but could you do me a favor?

04:22.095 --> 04:23.597
What is it, Dorothy?

04:25.849 --> 04:30.646
When you go on your walks,
can you avoid the park?

04:32.856 --> 04:35.192
There are just so many transients
setting up camp,

04:35.275 --> 04:41.573
and considering what happened,
I think it's the safest option.

04:47.079 --> 04:49.915
There was a danger,
but that time has passed now.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.169
You don't need to worry about them.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.130
Sweetie.

04:57.756 --> 05:01.552
Whoever these people are,
they're just another cult.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.054
Do you see the dangerous pattern here?

05:04.680 --> 05:06.098
Well, we see things differently.

05:07.099 --> 05:13.021
I'm concerned
about your decision-making in general.

05:14.940 --> 05:18.277
Which is why I've made
an appointment for you to see my ob-gyn.

05:18.861 --> 05:19.945
It's come to my attention

05:20.028 --> 05:22.447
that you're having intercourse
with my brother.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.120
Dorothy, have you been
going through my things?

05:28.203 --> 05:29.204
No.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.081
Absolutely not.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.085
That would be very upsetting to me.

05:35.961 --> 05:38.922
We weren't allowed private things
when I was at the Lesser Saints.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.091
You are entitled to your privacy.

05:42.593 --> 05:45.512
We need to have trust in this house,

05:45.596 --> 05:49.266
which is why we need to be honest
with each other about everything.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.560
Thank you for this conversation, Dorothy.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.438
It really has given me
a lot to think about.

05:55.355 --> 05:59.318
Hi. Hi. Yeah, there you go.

07:59.229 --> 08:03.358
Okay. It's a little disturbing,
but it's mostly harmless.

08:03.442 --> 08:05.694
It's not unusual for a young person

08:05.777 --> 08:08.405
to poke fun
at the authority figure in their life.

08:09.489 --> 08:13.911
Well, that's easy for you to say.
You're not the one being mocked.

08:15.454 --> 08:17.581
And it's not just this. I--

08:17.664 --> 08:21.877
I'm concerned that her issues are
too big for us to handle.

08:21.960 --> 08:25.881
Now, I'm not one to victim blame,
but she's reckless.

08:25.964 --> 08:28.717
She has a fascination
with these homeless kids.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.801
And?

08:30.928 --> 08:32.513
"And"?

08:32.596 --> 08:37.518
And maniacs chased her through our house.
She's a magnet for the deranged.

08:37.601 --> 08:39.811
I don't want my son exposed to creeps!

08:39.895 --> 08:43.065
Dorothy, Jericho's safe.
I know you're stressed.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.608
You shouldn't have to sit around

08:44.691 --> 08:47.903
and wait for an assignment
from the station like some amateur.

08:49.238 --> 08:51.073
How is that relevant?

08:51.156 --> 08:56.495
Tonight is a gift.
No calls, no prep, no Gourmet Gauntlet.

08:56.578 --> 09:01.208
I just-- I don't have the bandwidth
to freak out over every little thing.

09:03.252 --> 09:05.128
I'm so sorry, Bobby Flay.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.507
Is my concern for our family disrupting
your busy schedule?

09:08.590 --> 09:10.968
I finally succeed in a big way,
and you can't stand it?

09:11.051 --> 09:13.887
-Sean.
-This isn't just my win. This is our win--

09:13.971 --> 09:15.889
Sean! I'm trying to talk to you
about something urgent!

09:15.973 --> 09:17.683
Yes, the hungry children in the park

09:17.766 --> 09:20.394
who are somehow
some sinister threat to our family.

09:26.149 --> 09:28.151
Just tell me when dinner's ready.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.218
Thank you.

09:53.969 --> 09:54.970
Come.

10:14.156 --> 10:15.157
He's beautiful.

10:17.618 --> 10:18.619
He's a miracle.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.634
Come here. We have new things to show you.

10:39.348 --> 10:40.432
Hey, pretty.

10:49.608 --> 10:51.151
What is it about her?

10:54.196 --> 10:56.156
She's extraordinary.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.075
Courageous enough to rebel.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.077
Against who?

11:01.411 --> 11:03.038
Anyone who gets in her way.

11:35.571 --> 11:36.697
-Oh, my God.
-Hey.

11:36.780 --> 11:37.781
I'm sorry.

11:43.161 --> 11:46.164
Excuse me there. Excuse me. Excuse me.

11:46.248 --> 11:47.457
Dorothy.

11:50.294 --> 11:51.503
Get his stroller now.

12:05.475 --> 12:08.270
I'd like to know why you felt the need
to put my son's life in danger

12:08.353 --> 12:12.441
by taking him to a homeless encampment
after I explicitly asked you not to.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.194
Dorothy, you just don't understand.

12:15.277 --> 12:17.446
I would never take him there
if it wasn't safe.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.239
Everybody there is kind and gentle.

12:19.323 --> 12:22.534
It's all ready. Bulgogi's not supposed to
be served room temperature, so let's go.

12:23.911 --> 12:28.332
Leanne. You are 18,
and you may feel safe out there.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.917
I'm here to tell you, you're not.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.504
But that doesn't give you the right
to decide what's safe for my child.

12:33.587 --> 12:36.089
Now, I asked you nicely before,
but you leave me no choice.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.758
I forbid you to go back to that park.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.677
It's so funny how controlling you can be.

12:40.761 --> 12:43.430
It's almost like Aunt May.
See the dangerous pattern here?

12:45.182 --> 12:46.433
Smells delicious, Sean.

12:46.517 --> 12:48.685
I'd love you to try it.
Why don't you join us?

12:53.565 --> 12:56.485
Sean, she had him outside
with those people.

12:57.736 --> 12:58.820
Was he hurt?

12:58.904 --> 12:59.905
No, but--

13:00.822 --> 13:03.116
-Well, I'll talk to her about it.
-Not good enough.

13:04.243 --> 13:06.203
What do you want me to do? Throw her out?

13:06.870 --> 13:08.163
We both know Leanne's not perfect,

13:08.247 --> 13:10.541
but you were the one who said
we could help rehabilitate her.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.251
So, why do you wanna give up now?

13:12.876 --> 13:14.545
What-- I'm not giving up.

13:14.628 --> 13:18.715
Then why can't you just be happy?
We can fix whatever's wrong with Leanne.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.718
But right now, we're in a good place
we haven't been for a while.

13:21.802 --> 13:25.806
So why don't we just enjoy this dinner
and this Chilean Syrah that I bought--

13:27.975 --> 13:30.978
Dorothy. Come on.
It's getting cold, honey.

13:31.895 --> 13:32.896
Is Dorothy okay?

13:34.064 --> 13:35.315
Yeah, she's fine.

13:36.108 --> 13:39.111
She's just concerned about you
and the kids in the park

13:39.194 --> 13:40.404
and everyone out there.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.535
They just wanna learn from me.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.998
Nobody's ever seen what they see in me.

13:51.081 --> 13:53.208
And why do you think
they treat you like that?

13:57.379 --> 13:58.422
Maybe I deserve it.

14:12.227 --> 14:14.396
Leanne! Could you come here a sec?

14:18.066 --> 14:20.068
-Hi, Veera.
-How you doin'?

14:20.152 --> 14:21.153
Good.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.281
Did you need something, Dorothy?

14:24.364 --> 14:25.574
Have a seat.

14:25.657 --> 14:26.658
Hi, Leanne.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.751
Leanne, I have to be honest.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.878
I was really pretty angry
with you last night.

14:37.961 --> 14:41.465
But after a good night's sleep
and some sun salutations,

14:41.548 --> 14:43.133
I had an epiphany.

14:43.217 --> 14:48.305
The reason you and I are butting heads is
because you are stuck in this house.

14:49.348 --> 14:50.432
And given your history,

14:50.516 --> 14:53.435
you haven't had an opportunity
to experience independence.

14:54.019 --> 14:57.231
And Julian told me
about Veera's dance background.

14:57.314 --> 15:01.360
Yeah. And Dorothy told me
how much you enjoy your dance lessons.

15:01.443 --> 15:03.362
She says you have real talent.

15:04.488 --> 15:07.574
I think you'd be perfect
for something called dance semiotics.

15:07.658 --> 15:09.201
Listen. You're gonna love this.

15:10.786 --> 15:11.912
What's happening in here?

15:13.789 --> 15:14.873
Leave or be quiet.

15:15.541 --> 15:18.669
Look, it's an institute in New Jersey

15:18.752 --> 15:21.839
with a special,
two-month dance semiotics program

15:21.922 --> 15:26.134
where you'll get all this training
and the studio time,

15:26.677 --> 15:28.554
but also classes in basic anatomy

15:28.637 --> 15:31.598
and applying semiotics
to everyday communication.

15:31.682 --> 15:35.477
It's like science for dancers
with a little philosophy on the side.

15:35.561 --> 15:37.145
But it's not all work.

15:37.229 --> 15:41.066
Twice a week, they have social activities
planned for the students, like bowling.

15:42.401 --> 15:46.697
Look, you'll be gaining valuable tools
in building your career.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.449
For instance, you're great with kids.

15:49.533 --> 15:52.661
If you ever wanted
to teach dance lessons to kids someday,

15:52.744 --> 15:54.454
this would look great on your rÃ©sumÃ©.

15:55.330 --> 15:59.459
And the best part is,
they usually have a really long wait list,

15:59.543 --> 16:04.464
but Veera was able to pull some strings
so they can take you right now.

16:07.134 --> 16:11.346
And we'll take care of everything.
All you have to do is say yes.

16:11.430 --> 16:14.600
Yeah. What do you think, Leanne?

16:17.311 --> 16:19.813
You are mature and creative

16:19.897 --> 16:23.525
and far too smart to turn down
an opportunity like this.

16:23.609 --> 16:24.610
Right?

16:25.611 --> 16:27.571
When it's done, you can always come back.

16:28.405 --> 16:31.825
Yeah, absolutely.
You can come back and visit.

16:35.579 --> 16:38.582
Great, I just booked
a train ticket for you for tomorrow.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.960
Classes don't actually start till Monday.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.463
Well, why wait?

16:45.297 --> 16:48.008
Leanne might wanna get a head start
on her adventure.

16:58.352 --> 16:59.561
A little keepsake.

17:01.688 --> 17:02.731
You looked beautiful

17:02.814 --> 17:05.442
when you wore that
at Julian's birthday party last year.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.528
I wanted you to have it.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.241
That's okay.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.993
I wouldn't wanna take your dress.

17:32.177 --> 17:35.597
How could you just do that
without consulting me at all?

17:37.641 --> 17:38.934
I tried.

17:39.017 --> 17:41.520
You told me to smile and eat my dinner.

17:42.855 --> 17:45.023
I can't trust her. It's not working.

17:47.192 --> 17:48.694
Jericho loves her.

17:50.988 --> 17:53.407
I feel anxious with her around.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.701
I don't feel comfortable
leaving her alone with Jericho,

17:55.784 --> 17:59.204
a problem since being alone
with Jericho is her job.

18:00.205 --> 18:01.748
We need to face facts.

18:01.832 --> 18:05.419
As long as she's here,
this cult could come for her at any time.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.713
No, this is how it has to be.

18:08.422 --> 18:11.592
And this dance camp,
it'll be good for her, you know?

18:11.675 --> 18:13.927
She'll see she needs
more than we can give her,

18:14.011 --> 18:16.013
and everyone will be better off.

18:18.974 --> 18:21.476
I have no say of
what happens in my son's life.

18:21.560 --> 18:23.896
It doesn't matter how I feel.
You're gonna do whatever you want.

18:23.979 --> 18:25.480
I need a partner,

18:25.564 --> 18:28.025
not some placater, patronizer husband

18:28.108 --> 18:30.444
who's perfectly willing
to gaslight his wife!

18:30.527 --> 18:31.904
-"Gaslight"?
-Yes!

18:32.905 --> 18:35.324
Do not fucking tell me
that everything is fine

18:35.407 --> 18:39.161
and that I should be happy,
because it's fucking not!

18:40.412 --> 18:42.039
You're supposed to be on my side!

18:52.090 --> 18:57.554
When the program's finished,
we check in with her to reassess.

18:57.638 --> 18:58.889
It's only fair.

21:00.844 --> 21:03.805
Leanne, won't you come join us?

21:03.889 --> 21:06.308
No, thank you, Mrs. Turner.
I'm fine as I am.

21:14.691 --> 21:16.026
This is a bad idea.

21:16.109 --> 21:18.153
I can smell a bad idea
from three states away,

21:18.237 --> 21:19.238
and this one reeks.

21:19.321 --> 21:20.781
Fortunately, it's not your decision.

21:20.864 --> 21:22.741
Exactly. Julian, you have your process.

21:22.824 --> 21:24.117
Don't interfere with theirs.

21:24.201 --> 21:26.745
I know I'm not in a position
to judge irrational decision-making,

21:26.828 --> 21:29.206
but in this case, I am judging
your irrational decision-making.

21:29.289 --> 21:31.750
Okay, babe? This is not about you, okay?

21:33.752 --> 21:38.465
I appreciate everyone's concern,
but really there's nothing to discuss.

21:39.216 --> 21:42.219
Leanne is leaving today,
and that's just the way it is.

21:45.681 --> 21:46.682
What?

21:46.765 --> 21:48.934
I'm here to take Leanne
to the train station.

21:49.017 --> 21:51.019
Tobe, you're a little early.

21:51.103 --> 21:52.563
Okay, I can just wait in the--

21:53.397 --> 21:58.944
Okay, I have your ticket.
And your confirmation number is here.

21:59.444 --> 22:02.865
And I have the name and the number,
the address of the institute--

22:02.948 --> 22:04.658
-Let me, let me. Okay.
-Okay.

22:04.741 --> 22:07.744
I think it would be best for him
if you say goodbye now, Leanne.

22:11.415 --> 22:12.416
Yes.

22:13.292 --> 22:15.460
Did you even bother to ask her
what she wants?

22:15.544 --> 22:17.963
Leanne knows this is a rare opportunity.

22:18.964 --> 22:21.633
What the hell is it?
Dance semiotics? You sure this is real?

22:21.717 --> 22:24.011
-It's okay. It's okay.
-It sounds like a scam.

22:24.094 --> 22:25.929
-It's perfectly legitimate.
-Look, your chair.

22:26.013 --> 22:27.931
You know this because of
your 90 minutes of research?

22:28.015 --> 22:30.475
You like this chair, right? Yeah.

22:30.559 --> 22:32.686
-I think you love this chair.
-You need to calm down.

22:32.769 --> 22:35.480
Veera knows
the director of the institute personally.

22:35.564 --> 22:38.901
Veera used to suck dick for Sudafed.
She's not an authority on anything.

22:38.984 --> 22:40.903
Why are you so dead set
against her leaving?

22:40.986 --> 22:44.990
Can we just step back for a second
and talk instead of yelling?

22:45.073 --> 22:46.200
It's okay.

22:47.910 --> 22:51.997
I'll go, Mr. Turner. It's only two months.

23:21.944 --> 23:23.737
You're gonna love it.

23:24.321 --> 23:25.739
I promise.

23:46.301 --> 23:47.553
He's poopy.

23:49.054 --> 23:50.097
I was gonna change him,

23:50.180 --> 23:52.516
but I don't think you want
my filthy meth head hands

23:52.599 --> 23:53.809
near his swimsuit area.

23:55.060 --> 23:58.313
This is a complicated situation,
okay, beyond what you think you know.

23:58.397 --> 24:00.983
-There are dynamics at play.
-You just called me a crank whore.

24:01.066 --> 24:02.860
That is not complicated, Julian.

24:02.943 --> 24:05.487
I've done some things
that I wish I could undo, but I can't,

24:05.571 --> 24:09.658
so I own up to them without shame
because shame is the gateway to relapse.

24:10.367 --> 24:13.620
What a dick move to use
my personal history as a weapon.

24:13.704 --> 24:15.455
You're right. I'm not sorry.

24:15.539 --> 24:16.748
Okay, you cannot--

24:28.844 --> 24:31.471
I can't do this again. I can't.

24:32.890 --> 24:34.725
-What the fuck did you do?
-Nothing.

24:34.808 --> 24:35.809
Where the fuck is he?

24:35.893 --> 24:37.811
What do you mean?
I put him in the high chair.

24:37.895 --> 24:40.772
I put him in the high chair.
I didn't do anything.

24:42.191 --> 24:43.192
The cellar.

24:44.318 --> 24:46.320
-Thank God.
-Christ, not this again.

24:51.575 --> 24:55.495
I didn't do anything.
I just put him in the fucking high chair.

24:55.579 --> 24:56.997
Shut up!

24:58.290 --> 25:00.959
-Kitchen!
-You were just there!

25:07.174 --> 25:10.010
I left him in the high chair.
Julian, wait.

25:31.865 --> 25:33.575
-Oh, no.
-I'll check the cameras.

25:35.118 --> 25:37.162
This is toxic groupthink.
We need to call the cops.

25:37.246 --> 25:39.289
How could you turn your back on him?

25:39.373 --> 25:40.374
What is wrong with you?

25:40.999 --> 25:42.626
What is wrong with you?

25:49.842 --> 25:52.719
Leanne. Hey, are you okay?

25:53.637 --> 25:55.597
-You're losing yourself in this misery.
-Fuck.

25:55.681 --> 25:58.016
You can't keep walking around
like it doesn't exist.

25:58.100 --> 26:00.352
Being the child of shrinks
doesn't make you one.

26:02.062 --> 26:05.482
I'm doing the work. Every day,
I'm working through my bullshit.

26:06.066 --> 26:07.776
And it's not fun, but I do it.

26:07.860 --> 26:11.196
You need to face
the worst pain that you've ever felt

26:11.280 --> 26:12.906
if you honestly wanna get better.

26:12.990 --> 26:15.409
And I can't help you with that.

26:15.993 --> 26:17.327
I have to protect myself.

26:17.411 --> 26:20.205
Great.
Go protect yourself far away from me.

26:47.316 --> 26:48.317
Shit.

26:49.443 --> 26:50.444
Dorothy?

27:02.915 --> 27:04.249
What the fuck?

27:36.323 --> 27:40.744
Leanne? If we don't leave now,
you're definitely gonna miss your train.

27:42.246 --> 27:43.247
Fuck.

27:45.541 --> 27:47.000
If you're as smart as I think you are,

27:47.084 --> 27:48.919
you'll get on that train
and not look back.

27:50.546 --> 27:51.755
I'm confused.

27:53.841 --> 27:54.842
Leanne?

27:57.678 --> 27:58.887
Go home, Tobe.

28:10.941 --> 28:13.193
Caterpillars? What the fuck?

28:34.214 --> 28:36.175
Where is my son?

28:37.259 --> 28:40.262
You have ten seconds.
You know what I'm capable of.

28:43.098 --> 28:44.516
He's asleep in the nursery.

28:47.603 --> 28:48.854
He's been there this whole time.

28:49.730 --> 28:50.939
That's impossible.

28:51.899 --> 28:53.734
I've torn this whole house--

29:11.543 --> 29:12.544
Oh, God.

29:14.129 --> 29:16.798
-Baby. Baby.
-Hey.

29:24.431 --> 29:26.600
Okay. Okay.

29:39.238 --> 29:40.614
Veera's gone now.

29:45.118 --> 29:46.328
It was inevitable.

29:46.870 --> 29:48.288
She wasn't right for you.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.041
You're both broken.

29:52.835 --> 29:54.419
But you don't need to be fixed.

30:00.759 --> 30:01.969
Leanne stays.

30:03.512 --> 30:07.140
If Leanne's here, Jericho's here.
So, Leanne stays.

30:08.642 --> 30:09.768
What are you, insane?

30:09.852 --> 30:12.145
She had someone come in our house,

30:12.229 --> 30:15.357
hide our child from us
like some depraved prank.

30:15.440 --> 30:16.441
She is sick.

30:16.525 --> 30:18.151
I don't wanna lose my son again.

30:18.902 --> 30:19.903
Leanne stays.

30:23.615 --> 30:26.535
No. Sean, there is a plan in motion.

30:26.618 --> 30:28.036
-You can't do this.
-Leanne,

30:28.120 --> 30:30.831
I would like to apologize
on my wife's behalf.

30:31.623 --> 30:33.041
Don't you dare apologize for me.

30:33.125 --> 30:38.255
But we would all be very grateful
if you would stay for as long as you like.

30:38.338 --> 30:39.840
That would make me very happy.

30:48.432 --> 30:51.143
Thank you for trying
to broaden my horizons, Dorothy.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.147
But I could never leave Jericho.

30:56.231 --> 30:59.443
If I'm not here,
anything could happen to him.
