- [explosion in the distance]
- What the hell is happening?

02:13.258 --> 02:19.264
Best guess, 20 to 25 men in riot gear
are making their way through the prison...

02:19.347 --> 02:21.892
using smoke bombs, electrified shields,

02:21.975 --> 02:26.396
and, when necessary,
bullets to take down every person in here.

02:26.479 --> 02:30.818
That noise was most likely the front doors
gettin' blasted open with explosives.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.527
But they won't kill us, right?

02:33.528 --> 02:35.656
That's insane.
They're not gonna kill us.

02:35.739 --> 02:38.992
[scoffs] Were you not paying attention
four days ago

02:39.076 --> 02:40.744
when death came to the cafeteria?

02:40.828 --> 02:42.955
I sure as hell didn't make a secret bunker

02:43.038 --> 02:45.623
because I thought
these things end in a handshake.

02:45.708 --> 02:46.948
Shit! We gotta get out of here.

02:47.876 --> 02:51.504
Hell of a lot safer down here
than it is up there.

02:52.214 --> 02:55.801
I think peaceful surrender
is a better bet.

02:56.426 --> 02:59.554
Yeah, sounds better than waiting for them
to throw a bomb down here

02:59.637 --> 03:00.931
and blow us all up.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.184
Okay, well, you're in no condition to go
running towards a bunch of armed men.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.269
I think that we're gonna
have to stay here.

03:06.353 --> 03:10.107
The real tragedy is that we're gonna die
before we can fight over the wedding cake.

03:10.899 --> 03:11.900
Okay.

03:12.650 --> 03:14.987
I understand that sarcasm is your thing

03:15.070 --> 03:17.239
and I want to love
and accept all parts of you,

03:17.322 --> 03:20.617
but can you please not make jokes
about dying right now?

03:20.700 --> 03:22.870
[Gina] Oh, shit!
I'm totally freaking out!

03:22.953 --> 03:25.163
Gina, take a deep breath.

03:25.247 --> 03:29.042
Frieda is right.
Staying here is safer.

03:29.126 --> 03:33.130
When they find us, we can say
we didn't even know what was happening.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.214
Okay, yeah.

03:34.297 --> 03:38.176
Except for the 250-pound guard
we have tied up down there.

03:38.260 --> 03:42.264
I gotta get out of here.
I gotta get outside. I gotta go.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.892
[Anita sighs]

03:44.975 --> 03:47.227

03:53.691 --> 03:55.986

03:56.069 --> 03:58.280
We'll be better off
if we all stay together.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.572
Safety in numbers.

04:05.788 --> 04:09.041
- See you on the other side.
- [door closes]

04:09.124 --> 04:13.086
They should be calling about Benny soon.
Or trying to call. Jesus.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.148
- [inmates yelling]
- They're here. The dudes. It's over.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.925
- The riot's over?
- Holy shit. They're coming to rescue us?

04:18.007 --> 04:20.552
"Us"?
They're gonna rescue you, crucify us.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.781
Where's my cell phone? I have to call him.
I haven't called him.

04:22.805 --> 04:24.973
Uh, I traded it. For this.

04:25.057 --> 04:27.350
I... I bet you could make it
to Healy's office.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.601
There's a phone in there.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.406
Hide under the desk so they don't see
your shadow through the blinds.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.566
Thank you.
Come on. I won't be able to run.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.194
See? I knew a knife
would be better than a phone.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.320
Good luck.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.616
Please.
[grunts] Fuck! Thank you.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.495
[grunts] Thank you.
Thank you so much.

04:49.247 --> 04:50.248
[chuckles]

04:51.083 --> 04:55.253
Fuck! Look, hey, no judgments.
Whatever you're into.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.818
But it doesn't really feel like
the right time for kinky stuff.

04:57.881 --> 04:58.924
[chuckles]

05:01.134 --> 05:03.720
You gonna be my human shield, <i>papi.</i>

05:04.554 --> 05:07.808
They wanna kill me...
they gotta get through you first.

05:07.891 --> 05:10.102
- Let's go.
- Out there?

05:10.185 --> 05:13.939
That... that is such a bad idea.
Let them come in here.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.608
That way we can surrender
all chill and everything.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.776
- [clicks tongue]
- Oh, fuck!

05:21.947 --> 05:23.365
[inmates yelling indistinctly]

05:24.074 --> 05:25.301
- [Ouija grunts] Sorry.
- My bad.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.534
Go left.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.120
- Yo, we gotta go.
- I'm trying!

05:28.203 --> 05:29.997
- Wait, where are you going?
- The library!

05:30.080 --> 05:32.641
Bad move! They're coming from the lobby.
They'll hit the library first!

05:32.665 --> 05:34.310
What, you're criticizing our strategy now?

05:34.334 --> 05:36.086
Depends on what your strategy is.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.671
You trying to surrender
like the rest of these pussy turncoats?

05:38.755 --> 05:39.756
You're kidding, right?

05:39.839 --> 05:41.359
We been at the front of this
since the beginning.

05:41.383 --> 05:42.861
So you're gonna stay
and fight the fuckers?

05:42.885 --> 05:44.386
Uh, you askin' us to join your team?

05:44.469 --> 05:45.762
Team latte.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.556
- Oh, shit! She funny?
- She has her moments.

05:48.640 --> 05:52.269
We come this far.
Ain't nobody takin' us easy. We're in.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.229
Go! Now.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.526
Fuck, we gotta get you out of here.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.694
But everything's gonna be okay, right?

06:01.778 --> 06:04.031
- [chuckles] I don't know, kid.
- Sit here.

06:04.114 --> 06:06.616
Baby, they are on their way here.

06:06.699 --> 06:10.745
- But it's not like we can avoid it, right?
- No, but I gotta go tell Red and company.

06:10.828 --> 06:13.123
- I'm scared.
- [sighs]

06:14.249 --> 06:17.044
All right, look.
Look, there is nothing to be scared of.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.272
All right, you're gonna lay on the ground
for a minute or two.

06:19.296 --> 06:22.066
They're gonna swing their dicks around
so they can feel like big, bad guys,

06:22.090 --> 06:24.370
and then everything is
just gonna return to shitty normal.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.761
- [panting]
- But what about the baby?

06:26.844 --> 06:29.597
If I survived
my mother's nightly martinis in utero,

06:29.681 --> 06:31.724
then your baby is going to survive this.

06:31.808 --> 06:35.645
No. After. What about after,
when it all goes back to shitty normal?

06:35.728 --> 06:37.897
I have to have this baby in prison.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.775
And... and who's gonna take him
when they take him away from me?

06:40.858 --> 06:45.197
[crying] Even my sister, she doesn't have
any room and my mother is a mess.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.616
- And Vinnie, he doesn't want it.
- Just look at me. Look at me.

06:49.659 --> 06:53.371
Your baby is gonna be better than great.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.290
You hear me?

06:56.083 --> 06:57.292
But how do you know?

06:58.001 --> 07:03.548
[chuckling] Because I know you and...
you're great.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.845
Now, look, I really gotta go.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.598
No. No, you can't go.
You have to stay.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.784
Five more minutes.
Just five more minutes. That's all.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.560
- [inmates yelling indistinctly]
- [sighs]

07:16.394 --> 07:20.607
Okay. All right, kid.
Five more minutes, okay?

07:25.946 --> 07:26.989
[sighs]

07:28.406 --> 07:29.950
[officers yelling indistinctly]

07:31.076 --> 07:33.578
- [officer] Hands in the air!
- [indistinct yelling]

07:33.661 --> 07:35.122
You have the first line.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.832
Right. Please don't shoot!

07:37.915 --> 07:39.251
We are innocent.

07:39.334 --> 07:42.462
We ain't got nothing to do
with any of this.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.840
Dear kind men in scary outfits,

07:45.923 --> 07:48.969
can't you see we are all
good, pious women

07:49.052 --> 07:51.972
who have been doing nothing
but praying for hours

07:52.055 --> 07:54.099
for all this to come to a peaceful end?

07:54.182 --> 07:56.143
[grunts] Ow! You really fucked this up.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.978
Yeah, maybe if we had better material.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.687
Oh, sure, blame the writer.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.023
At least they didn't shoot us.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.107
[grunts]

08:04.317 --> 08:06.111
- Get up.
- Please don't hurt me.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.030
Get up!

08:08.113 --> 08:09.423
What are you going to... [screams]

08:09.447 --> 08:11.449
No! [crying]

08:14.536 --> 08:16.856
I thought our mandate was
limited violence, minimal injury.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.166
- Looks minimal to me.
- [continues crying]

08:19.249 --> 08:21.049
Get her back to the lobby
and secure the room.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.588
[sobbing] Oh, God...
[talking indistinctly]

08:25.672 --> 08:26.881
Chapel secure.

08:26.964 --> 08:29.176
Team one moving south
toward the library hallway.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.699
- [man on walkie-talkie] <i>Copy that.</i>
- [woman crying] Why? Why?

08:32.261 --> 08:34.722
You think he was actually into me,

08:34.806 --> 08:37.517
or was only pretending
because we made him do it?

08:37.600 --> 08:42.230
Nah, I've raped guys before
and I could tell it was genuine for him.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.523
He, like, really tried.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.691
Yeah.

08:47.860 --> 08:51.156
- Well, what do you think we should do now?
- We could surrender, I guess.

08:51.239 --> 08:55.618
[grunts] No, I don't want to surrender!
I don't want the fun to stop.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.370
We could stay and fight 'em.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.248
It sounds like a lot of effort.

09:00.832 --> 09:01.958
We could get high.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.795
Sold! To the lady in the back
with nine fingertips.

09:06.796 --> 09:07.797
That was mean.

09:08.506 --> 09:11.301
Oh, my God!
You're so sensitive when you're sober.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.011
Well, it's a disability.
You shouldn't make fun of it.

09:14.762 --> 09:17.765
Maybe we could get you
one of those license plates for retards

09:17.849 --> 09:18.929
that let you park anywhere.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.936
- I can't drive!
- Really?

09:22.812 --> 09:24.772
But what about those buggy things?

09:25.815 --> 09:27.900
Is that a different license?

09:27.984 --> 09:30.487
You get it down at Department
of Horsey Vehicles?

09:30.570 --> 09:33.049
[Leanne] There's no such thing
as the Department of Horsey Vehicles.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.075
- [Angie neighing]
- [Leanne grunts frustratedly]

09:35.158 --> 09:36.951
[indistinct chatter]

09:37.034 --> 09:38.620
Oh, bad habit.

09:39.412 --> 09:43.250
- Better than most bad habits.
- [grunts] I suppose that's true.

09:43.333 --> 09:47.462
I don't really drink, but I could use
about a gallon of vodka right now.

09:47.545 --> 09:48.838
[chuckles] I hear you.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.718
Would a, uh, bit of scotch do the trick?

09:55.137 --> 09:56.763
- I believe it would.
- [chuckles]

09:59.516 --> 10:01.393
Honey, do you think that's a good idea?

10:02.144 --> 10:04.271
No. I think it's a great idea.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.022
Oh, come on, Pats.

10:07.899 --> 10:10.860
- Hmm. Do you have a daughter in there?
- I do.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.113
Mine called this morning.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.948
She seemed all right, but...

10:17.159 --> 10:21.288
she always seems to find her way
into the middle of things.

10:21.371 --> 10:26.793
I just hope and pray that she has enough
common sense to stay out of this one.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.129
Mine doesn't have much common sense...

10:29.962 --> 10:33.508
and I don't know that hopes and prayers
have ever been enough with her.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.052
What's her name?

10:36.761 --> 10:39.806
- Suzanne. Yours?
- Piper.

10:41.183 --> 10:43.143
It's not what you imagine, is it?

10:43.226 --> 10:45.728
When you hold them in your arms
for the first time?

10:46.438 --> 10:48.315
No. It is not.

10:50.233 --> 10:53.445
Fuck! Hey, yo!
They got Janae and Abdullah. We gotta go.

10:53.528 --> 10:56.656
[stammering] Well, she's not...
Her breathing, it's, like, off, man.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.074
All right, move.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.911
Hey, Suzanne.
Yo! You gotta wake up, yo.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.348
- [Black Cindy] Come on, Suzanne.
- Come on. Yo, we gotta go.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.416
Okay, look.
What if we find them riot guys,

11:06.499 --> 11:09.627
and we... and we walk up to 'em
with our hands up, like, real nice,

11:09.711 --> 11:11.939
- and tell 'em she needs help?
- They're not here to help!

11:11.963 --> 11:13.631
How are we gonna make her wake up, man?

11:13.715 --> 11:16.551
Okay, we can, um,
carry her to the pharmacy

11:16.634 --> 11:18.553
and try to find something, like...
that's the...

11:18.636 --> 11:21.031
the opposite of the shit you gave her.
But we gotta hurry. Come on!

11:21.055 --> 11:23.891
Man, we not gonna be able
to carry her that far.

11:23.975 --> 11:26.978
She built like a concrete house.
No offense.

11:27.061 --> 11:30.106
[yelling] Well, I don't know
what else the fuck to do, all right?

11:30.189 --> 11:31.733
They got dudes storming in here.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.861
I ain't slept in three days
and I don't got all the answers, man!

11:34.944 --> 11:36.779
You made this mess, you clean it!

11:36.863 --> 11:39.616
Uh... [gasps]
Oh, oh, I... I got an idea.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.952
All right. Um, stay with her.
All right? Just stay with her.

11:43.745 --> 11:46.914
[sighs] I can't lose you too.
For real, I can't lose you too.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.833
- [inmates yelling indistinctly]
- Move!

11:48.916 --> 11:49.917
[shoes squeak]

11:51.168 --> 11:52.545
[panting]

11:52.629 --> 11:53.713
[sighs]

11:53.796 --> 11:56.758
Really sorry about this, bud.
Need to borrow the chair.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.642
Typically,
I'd be more respectful of the dead,

11:58.676 --> 12:01.053
but you were a real son of a bitch
when you were alive.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.972
- [grunts]
- [thuds]

12:03.055 --> 12:04.223
Karma.

12:05.683 --> 12:06.768
You know what I'm saying?

12:10.480 --> 12:12.440
It's all over.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.235
It was gonna be over sometime.

12:15.318 --> 12:20.156
[clicks tongue] It's just... I feel like
I found my true calling, you know?

12:21.240 --> 12:25.578
- What, being pretty?
- No, being, like, a vlogger, or whatever.

12:25.662 --> 12:29.081
That ain't a real job. Jobs are, like,
maid, cook, reality TV star...

12:29.165 --> 12:30.375
Uh-uh. I've been reading,

12:30.458 --> 12:32.752
and people are making,
like, a billion dollars a year

12:32.835 --> 12:34.712
off of their YouTube shit.

12:34.796 --> 12:37.089
Well, that ain't ever gonna be us.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.967
At least, not in the near future.

12:40.051 --> 12:42.261
[scoffs] Or distant future.

12:43.805 --> 12:47.016
Maybe way, way in the future.

12:47.099 --> 12:50.437
[scoffs] Except we won't be cute no more.
That ain't never gonna be us.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.022
I hate this stupid fucking riot.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.694
Come on, we made such cool shit.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.780
But it was a taste of, like, being normal.

13:01.989 --> 13:05.368
It's better when you forget there's
a whole world outside of this place.

13:06.328 --> 13:07.995
And then maybe you don't feel so bad.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.498
I don't know.

13:10.582 --> 13:14.251
I've been in the world
and it wasn't all that great either.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.420
True.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.089
Plus...

13:20.049 --> 13:22.009
I got my best friend in here.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.848
- I know. We never would have met.
- Exactly.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.099
Yeah.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.810
- One last video? [chuckles]
- Yeah.

13:30.893 --> 13:34.146
- Yeah? All right. [chuckles]
- [inhales deeply] Okay.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.024
- [fly buzzing]
- [sighing]

13:45.533 --> 13:47.369
[siren wailing in the distance]

13:54.626 --> 13:57.587
See you later, motherfuckers!

14:02.258 --> 14:03.676
[indistinct chatter]

14:07.221 --> 14:09.098
This was a mistake.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.642
Can't go back now.

14:12.435 --> 14:17.440
- Guys... what's gonna happen to us?
- I don't know.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.443
But at least we'll all be together.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.904
[indistinct chatter on walkie-talkie]

14:22.987 --> 14:27.950
[officer] Up against the wall, now!
I said now!

14:28.034 --> 14:29.869
Huh, that wasn't so bad.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.203
Told you it'd be fine.

14:35.875 --> 14:39.671
- What the fuck went wrong here?
- Yeah, I've read about this.

14:39.754 --> 14:43.550
It's called elephantiasis.
It can happen to your balls too.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.134
Go fuck yourself.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.887
[chuckles] Really robbed yourself
of the sympathy vote, didn't ya?

14:47.970 --> 14:49.221
Let's go, bitch, you can walk.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.390
I have an infection.

14:50.473 --> 14:51.992
- Obviously not in your legs.
- [groans]

14:52.016 --> 14:53.017
[officer] Come on.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.523
- [officer gasps]
- Young man,

14:58.606 --> 15:01.693
we better be going steady
before you touch me like that again.

15:01.776 --> 15:02.860
[yells] You hear me?

15:26.258 --> 15:27.259
[grunts]

15:46.612 --> 15:47.780
[shoe squeaks]

16:03.713 --> 16:04.922
[gulps]

16:06.215 --> 16:09.761
What? If I'm going down,
then I might as well be drunk.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.304
That's a good idea.

16:19.311 --> 16:22.398
Oh, good.
I got the drunks in the draft.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.482
Ah.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.527
I hope they're okay.

16:27.069 --> 16:31.198
If anything happens to them...
I'll never be...

16:31.282 --> 16:34.118
- So was it worth it?
- What?

16:34.869 --> 16:37.705
The riot.
Was it worth it?

16:37.789 --> 16:38.956
Oh, don't do that.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.876
I'm not being a dick.
I'm serious.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.795
Things got out of hand.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.506
Out of hand?

16:47.799 --> 16:50.968
Wow. That's... real passive shit

16:51.052 --> 16:54.722
for a woman who's directly responsible
for the ogre in the corner, Red.

16:56.182 --> 17:01.145
Did you stop to think
before burying a body in my garden?

17:02.980 --> 17:05.942
I had to defend myself
in order to stay alive.

17:06.025 --> 17:10.613
So yes. I can say, definitively,
that that was worth it.

17:10.696 --> 17:11.906
Can you?

17:12.740 --> 17:14.951
We can't know that yet.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.913
Maybe they'll still meet
some of our demands.

17:21.790 --> 17:27.003
Maybe some grandma in Kansas
will read an article about this

17:27.088 --> 17:30.466
and she'll see us as people
instead of criminals.

17:31.926 --> 17:34.220
And then maybe she'll tell
all of her grandma friends

17:34.303 --> 17:35.847
and they'll tell their kids...

17:36.556 --> 17:38.515
and then they'll tell their grandkids.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.229
I mean, isn't that how
change really happens?

17:45.314 --> 17:48.484
Through Midwestern grandmas
having epiphanies?

17:54.531 --> 17:57.368
Maybe that will have made
all of this worth it.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.497
[indistinct chatter]

18:01.581 --> 18:02.665
Hey!

18:03.207 --> 18:05.710
- Fuck! What happened?
- We had a situation.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.796
Situation? You mean lithium?
You got anything to wake her up?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.590
Oh, coffee ain't gonna do the trick.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.592
Oh, my God! You.
You did this to her.

18:12.675 --> 18:14.612
I was just trying to do
the best I could, all right?

18:14.636 --> 18:16.763
Well, ain't that some <i>Sesame Street</i> BS.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.431
You get that we about to be mowed down
like some lawn gnomes

18:19.515 --> 18:20.683
and it's your fault, right?

18:20.767 --> 18:22.648
You know I was just trying
to get justice for...

18:22.727 --> 18:23.811
[both] Poussey.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.563
Yeah. It stopped being about her

18:26.648 --> 18:28.649
and started being about your pride
a long time ago.

18:28.691 --> 18:31.068
- [clicks tongue]
- [officer] Down on the ground!

18:31.152 --> 18:32.630
- Fuck, they're close.
- We gotta hide.

18:32.654 --> 18:33.946
- I know a place.
- Let's go.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.823
Not you, okay?
You gotta get out of here.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.509
- It is only gonna get more dangerous.
- No...

18:37.533 --> 18:39.661
I want you to walk down the hall
with your hands up.

18:39.744 --> 18:42.264
I want you to tell them you're pregnant
the minute you see them.

18:42.329 --> 18:45.582
- Yell it. Make sure that they hear you.
- Hey! Hey! Mazel tov!

18:45.667 --> 18:47.418
[stammers] Oh, thank you very much.

18:47.501 --> 18:50.212
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

18:50.296 --> 18:54.091
All right. Okay. Okay. Go, now!

18:55.927 --> 18:57.845
Come on! We all got to go. Shit!

18:58.763 --> 19:01.223
- Which way?
- Come on. This way.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.450
[officer] Show me your hands!

19:02.474 --> 19:04.351
- [Lorna] I'm pregnant!
- [officer] Get down!

19:04.435 --> 19:06.603
- I'm pregnant! I'm pregnant!
- Get down on the ground!

19:06.687 --> 19:09.440
Get your pregnant ass on the ground!
Now!

19:10.066 --> 19:11.567
On the ground!

19:19.200 --> 19:20.468
- [Angie yelps]
- [Leanne] What is it?

19:20.492 --> 19:22.870
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Abort! Abort!

19:22.954 --> 19:24.538
No! No!

19:24.621 --> 19:28.209
I am not letting this get in the way
of my one last riot high.

19:28.292 --> 19:31.628
- Move! Everybody move! Move!
- [grunts]

19:32.463 --> 19:34.674
Shouldn't you be more respectful
of the dead?

19:34.757 --> 19:37.426
Don't be stupid.
He's a guard, not a person.

19:38.886 --> 19:42.098
- Ang, get in here and close the door.
- Okay.

19:45.434 --> 19:46.602
You care if I go first?

19:49.605 --> 19:52.108
- [sniffing]
- Hey, Leanne?

19:52.191 --> 19:56.863
Dude, that wasn't even five seconds.
Chill out, you'll get your turn.

19:56.946 --> 19:57.947
[sniffing]

19:58.823 --> 20:02.910
A guard is dead and we are
in a very small closet with him

20:02.994 --> 20:06.080
and we finger-raped that other guard
and then we laughed about it.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.457
And we also tied up that girl
like she was a stray dog

20:08.540 --> 20:10.918
and the world is ending and I just...

20:12.461 --> 20:15.214
What if we're the bad guys?

20:15.923 --> 20:20.261
[chuckles] Oh, my God!
You sound so high already.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.322
- Are the fumes that strong? [sniffing]
- I mean it.

20:22.346 --> 20:27.977
What if, like, this whole time we thought
that we were Ariel, we're actually Ursula?

20:29.186 --> 20:32.064
Well, obviously I'm Sebastian
and you're Flounder.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.357
We are lovable clowns.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.234
I don't want to be a clown anymore.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.569
[sighs] Fine.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.572
You wanna move the dead guy
out into the hallway?

20:40.656 --> 20:44.535
No, I wanna, like, do something important.

20:44.618 --> 20:45.745
Like what?

20:48.164 --> 20:52.960
I don't know, but if we died in here...
would anybody even care?

20:53.044 --> 20:55.712
- I'd care.
- You would be dead.

20:55.797 --> 20:56.964
[sighs]

20:58.507 --> 21:00.426
Well, I guess
I'm already dead to my family.

21:01.718 --> 21:02.845
I don't know who my dad is

21:02.929 --> 21:06.140
and my mom is probably neck deep
in her own bucket of bleach right now.

21:10.812 --> 21:11.938
One second.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.065
[sniffs]

21:19.779 --> 21:23.950
Okay, I'm high enough
to make some bad decisions.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.243
- Let's go be good people. Come on.
- Yes!

21:26.327 --> 21:27.912
- Go, go, go!
- [sighs]

21:30.790 --> 21:32.249
See you later, dead guy.

21:32.333 --> 21:33.709
[officer] Move! Move! Move!

21:37.839 --> 21:39.924
Get your ass up
and against the wall, inmate.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.051
[indistinct chatter on walkie-talkie]

21:43.052 --> 21:44.720
Get the fuck up.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.600
Get the fuck up, bitch.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.230
Take care of her, please.

22:32.393 --> 22:37.731
Hey! Hey! Up against the wall. Do it now!
Hands up against the wall!

22:37.814 --> 22:40.276
Hey, shit, man.
You don't have to yell, like, loud.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.753
- I got ears, right?
- [officer shouts]

22:41.777 --> 22:44.613
Oh, fuck me! Okay, man.
Dude! Dude! I'm with you. I'm with you.

22:44.696 --> 22:45.697
[groans]

22:47.658 --> 22:49.159
Shit, you're strong.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.038
No! Those are... Those are mine!

22:53.915 --> 22:55.166
[screams] No!

22:55.249 --> 22:56.583
[grunting]

22:59.211 --> 23:00.438
- [screams]
- [stun gun crackling]

23:00.462 --> 23:01.463
[grunting]

23:02.965 --> 23:04.716
Come on, let's go! Move faster!

23:07.678 --> 23:09.364
Thank God you're here.
You've gotta help me.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.658
Get your ass against the wall
or I'mma shoot you in the face.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.451
- Are those real bullets?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

23:13.475 --> 23:15.394
- [shrieks]
- Get your hands up.

23:15.477 --> 23:16.478
What's gonna happen?

23:17.438 --> 23:18.522
I don't know.

23:18.605 --> 23:20.899
But you know, there are
very few circumstances in life

23:20.983 --> 23:24.695
when even I know to shut up.
So do us both a fucking favor.

23:26.155 --> 23:27.323
[inmate] Get off me!

23:27.406 --> 23:30.242
- [Gloria] Come on, come on. Come on.
- [line ringing]

23:30.326 --> 23:33.245
- [softly] Come on. Come on.
- [Lourdes in Spanish] <i>You've reached...</i>

23:33.329 --> 23:35.247
- [hangs up]
- [officer speaking indistinctly]

23:37.624 --> 23:39.168
[dialing]

23:40.711 --> 23:43.047
- [line ringing]
- [Lourdes in English] <i>Hello?</i>

23:43.130 --> 23:46.675
[in Spanish] Lourdes, it's me.
Is he... What's happening?

23:46.758 --> 23:49.303
The surgeon said everything went fine.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.222
<i>He just got out.</i>

23:51.305 --> 23:52.348
[cries]

23:54.641 --> 23:55.977
He's okay.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.561
[sighs] He's okay.

23:57.644 --> 23:58.812
[sighs]

24:00.106 --> 24:03.067
I'm not coming.
Things went wrong and...

24:04.068 --> 24:05.236
I'll tell him.

24:06.070 --> 24:07.238
Tell him I love him.

24:07.321 --> 24:08.423
[officer in English] Stop right there!

24:08.447 --> 24:09.991
[in Spanish] <i>I'll tell him.</i>

24:10.074 --> 24:15.162
If anything happens to me...
[breathing raggedly]

24:15.246 --> 24:17.748
My love... I promise.

24:17.831 --> 24:19.208
Thank you.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.876
[officer in English] What the fuck?

24:20.959 --> 24:23.962
[in Spanish] I'll call back
as soon as I can. I gotta go.

24:24.838 --> 24:27.258
[officer in English]
We have a man down. Man down!

24:29.676 --> 24:31.720
Get him outside. Now.

24:34.390 --> 24:36.725
Take the rest of this place
by any means necessary.

24:36.808 --> 24:40.146
Hey, does that mean we have permission
to start using the pepper bullets?

24:40.229 --> 24:42.814
Shut the fuck up, Natoli.
Let's move.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.317
On the move.
Heading toward dormitory A1.

24:45.401 --> 24:47.111
[man on walkie-talkie]
<i>Copy that. Proceed.</i>

24:49.530 --> 24:50.739
[grunts loudly]

24:59.915 --> 25:01.708
[officers speaking indistinctly]

25:01.792 --> 25:02.876
[sighs]

25:10.008 --> 25:11.760
[officer 1] Move it! Move it!

25:11.843 --> 25:14.284
[officer 2] Don't need anybody
asking questions at this point.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.906
Just stay ahead of me.
Stay ahead of me.

25:16.765 --> 25:17.766
[officer] Keep going.

25:20.018 --> 25:21.187
Move forward.

25:30.696 --> 25:31.738
[panting]

25:31.822 --> 25:34.783
- Let's put her on this chair over here.
- [grunting]

25:34.866 --> 25:38.620
Shit, man. This secret hiding place
couldn't have no elevators?

25:38.704 --> 25:41.957
Man, I done seen some white people shit
in my day.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.419
But climbing through a locker?
That takes the cake.

25:46.337 --> 25:47.754
[panting]

25:49.798 --> 25:54.303
Uh, if you lookin' for a reasonable
explanation for wherever the hell we are,

25:54.386 --> 25:55.512
don't think it's in there.

25:55.596 --> 25:57.449
All right, I'm just looking for
some uppers, you know?

25:57.473 --> 25:59.225
Some Adderall. Speed. Something.

25:59.308 --> 26:01.893
- Is that a good idea?
- It's better than a stroke, right?

26:01.977 --> 26:03.229
[Black Cindy] Whoa! Whoa!

26:04.480 --> 26:05.680
What, she could have a stroke?

26:06.315 --> 26:08.567
Well, what they do in <i>Pulp Fiction?</i>

26:09.318 --> 26:10.998
Come on, Frieda, you gotta have something.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.571
[sighs]

26:13.322 --> 26:15.199
There's a few EpiPens in the locker.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.534
- Top right.
- Where the hell did you come from?

26:17.618 --> 26:18.785
Where did I come from?

26:18.869 --> 26:20.996
[chuckles] You gotta be kidding me.

26:21.079 --> 26:23.582
- You know how to use that?
- [Nicky chuckles sarcastically]

26:23.665 --> 26:25.793
No. I'll do it.

26:26.293 --> 26:28.521
All right, look, you wanna put it
in her thigh right here.

26:28.545 --> 26:29.671
[sighs]

26:33.467 --> 26:34.593
[softly] Sorry.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.848
[Black Cindy grunts and sighs]

26:39.931 --> 26:41.099
Hey, what's...

26:42.393 --> 26:44.145
She's not waking up.

26:44.228 --> 26:45.521
- Come on, Suzanne.
- Suzanne.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.190
- Suzanne.
- Come on, Suzanne.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.334
- Come on, Suzanne.
- Suzanne.

26:49.358 --> 26:51.318
- Come on, Suzanne. Please wake up!
- Suzanne!

26:51.402 --> 26:53.082
- [gasps]
- [Black Cindy gasps] Oh, my God!

26:53.111 --> 26:54.155
I'm so sorry.

26:55.113 --> 26:57.866
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

26:57.949 --> 27:00.035
[sighs] Give the girl some room,
would you?

27:00.118 --> 27:01.412
[Black Cindy crying] Okay.

27:01.495 --> 27:03.038
[breathes heavily]

27:08.377 --> 27:09.920
Why do you look so worried?

27:12.923 --> 27:14.258
Do you need some sleep?

27:15.259 --> 27:21.640
[grunts] Mommy says
seven and a half hours is ideal.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.642
No more, no less. [clicks tongue]

27:25.686 --> 27:29.731
I must have gotten that much
because... I feel great.

27:29.815 --> 27:31.149
[chuckles]

27:32.276 --> 27:33.735
Shh... Like...

27:35.321 --> 27:37.198
[grunting]

27:41.827 --> 27:43.870
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

27:46.457 --> 27:49.876
Seriously... you look exhausted.

27:50.586 --> 27:51.670
[Taystee chuckles lightly]

27:54.130 --> 27:56.258
- We glad you back, girl.
- Mmm-hmm.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.884
[inmates yelling indistinctly]

27:57.968 --> 27:59.636
[Angie breathing heavily]

28:01.472 --> 28:06.477
[sighs] I didn't know being a good person
was gonna be this hard.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.395
- We're almost done.
- [panting]

28:09.688 --> 28:12.148
- It'll be worth it. I promise.
- Yeah.

28:13.108 --> 28:14.943
- [Dwight snoring]
- [Reema] What's going on?

28:15.026 --> 28:16.612
- Is she fucking sleeping?
- Dwight!

28:16.695 --> 28:17.946
- Man!
- Dwight!

28:18.029 --> 28:21.074
- What's wrong with you?
- I doze off when I'm nervous, okay?

28:21.157 --> 28:22.784
[sniffs] What's that smell?

28:23.952 --> 28:25.704
[Babs] I fart when I'm nervous.

28:25.787 --> 28:29.166
- [Natoli] Get out of there right now!
- [all yelling indistinctly]

28:29.250 --> 28:33.545
Let's go, ladies. Come on. Let's go.
Get up! Get up!

28:33.629 --> 28:34.713
You too, princess. Come on.

28:34.796 --> 28:38.509
I want it recorded somewhere that I didn't
have anything to do with any of this.

28:38.592 --> 28:41.553
Are you wearing those little
video cameras around your necks?

28:41.637 --> 28:44.180
I want everyone to know
that I was an innocent...

28:44.265 --> 28:45.682
[gasps]

28:45.766 --> 28:48.310
Go ahead.
Shoot me, you scum bucket.

28:48.394 --> 28:49.603
Shut up!

28:50.312 --> 28:52.231
What the fuck are you doing?

28:53.148 --> 28:55.401
You told us to take this place
by any means necessary.

28:55.484 --> 28:57.295
You're supposed to shoot up,
you fucking idiot.

28:57.319 --> 29:00.239
Up into the ceiling,
so the little balls explode

29:00.322 --> 29:02.491
and the capsaicin
rains down on your target.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.176
Shoot 'em in the head with those,
they die,

29:04.200 --> 29:06.370
and then there's so much
fuckin' paperwork.

29:06.453 --> 29:08.289
Pepper bullets up.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.832
You want fun, go mace or Taser.
We clear?

29:11.583 --> 29:12.584
Yeah.

29:16.463 --> 29:17.964
Thank you for not killing me.

29:18.048 --> 29:19.800
I'm sorry about the scum bucket thing...

29:19.883 --> 29:22.093
- [groans]
- Go fuck yourself!

29:22.177 --> 29:25.013
- [Dwight cries and whimpers]
- Punching 'em in the face works too.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.140
- Rein, get her out of here.
- Yes, sir.

29:27.223 --> 29:28.660
Out the back door by the loading dock

29:28.684 --> 29:31.603
so the media doesn't see blood
and freak out. Let's move!

29:31.687 --> 29:33.939
[man speaking indistinctly
on walkie-talkie]

29:37.025 --> 29:38.944
Wait! No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.195
Let's go. We made it.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.323
Fuck, no.
I see what you're doing.

29:42.406 --> 29:43.686
I'm not going through that door.

29:43.740 --> 29:46.076
Whoever goes through that door,
gets shot by whatever cop

29:46.159 --> 29:49.580
amped up on shitty coffee and testosterone
is waiting out there.

29:49.663 --> 29:50.943
You a real pussy, you know that?

29:51.915 --> 29:53.166
It's hot.

29:53.875 --> 29:54.876
Thank you?

29:55.669 --> 29:57.212
No one's out there, you dumbass.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.057
- [officer speaking indistinctly]
- Told you.

30:00.090 --> 30:02.277
[Dwight] Can you at least
give me a tissue or something?

30:02.301 --> 30:04.428
- [groans]
- [Dwight] I'm bleeding over everything.

30:04.511 --> 30:07.306
Jesus Christ,
do you ever shut the fuck up?

30:07.389 --> 30:10.851
Ow! You're hurting me.
[cries] I need to see a doctor.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.186
[Rein] Don't shoot, it's me.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.010
Hell of a meet cute, am I right?

30:16.773 --> 30:18.984
- I don't think I can walk.
- What?

30:19.067 --> 30:21.277
My ankle, it...
it feels like it's on fire.

30:22.738 --> 30:24.280
- [exhales heavily]
- Shit.

30:26.617 --> 30:28.702
[indistinct chatter on walkie-talkie]

30:33.289 --> 30:35.041
- [indistinct chatter]
- [officer] Clear!

30:39.630 --> 30:41.923
[all grunting and yelling indistinctly]

30:44.300 --> 30:45.301
What the fuck?

30:52.017 --> 30:53.435
[grunts]

30:58.064 --> 30:59.566
[grunting]

31:00.942 --> 31:02.110
Let's go, you little bitches.

31:16.124 --> 31:17.333
You asshole! [grunts]

31:17.834 --> 31:19.378
[panting]

31:19.461 --> 31:21.337
What the fuck is this?

31:22.088 --> 31:23.339
Human tacos.

31:29.262 --> 31:30.889
We love you guys.

31:30.972 --> 31:32.974
Yeah, we wouldn't be anything
without our fans.

31:33.642 --> 31:37.187
Thank you so much for all the nice
comments about our tits and everything.

31:37.270 --> 31:38.939
Yeah, we really appreciate it.

31:39.022 --> 31:43.193
- This one is for you, Belieber 1996!
- 1996!

31:43.276 --> 31:45.278
[both] One, two, three.

31:45.361 --> 31:47.238
[both screaming]

31:47.322 --> 31:48.449
Over here! Move it! Move it!

31:48.532 --> 31:51.117
- We surrender! We surrender!
- Ow!

31:51.201 --> 31:52.578
Fuck, you're hurting me!

31:52.661 --> 31:54.621
This is how they treat us all the time.

31:54.705 --> 31:57.248
- Put the phone down.
- Oops, sorry! Posted it.

31:57.332 --> 31:58.917
[screams]

31:59.710 --> 32:01.563
- [whimpering] Oh, my God...
- [officer yelling indistinctly]

32:01.587 --> 32:02.747
[Maritza continues screaming]

32:03.714 --> 32:07.593

I swear to God!

32:07.676 --> 32:09.219
[cries and screams]

32:09.302 --> 32:10.929
[Yadriel] Maria!

32:12.222 --> 32:13.682
- Maria!
- [indistinct chatter]

32:23.358 --> 32:28.321
Hey! Hey, Officer! Uh, give her
five minutes and then bring her back.

32:28.404 --> 32:33.159
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
[stutters] You came! You came!

32:33.243 --> 32:34.536
- You okay?
- [cries] Yeah.

32:35.245 --> 32:38.915
[breathes heavily] Yeah.
Yes, I'm okay. I'm okay. Can I?

32:38.999 --> 32:40.917
- Yeah.
- [cries]

32:41.001 --> 32:45.797
Hi, <i>mami!</i> Hi! Hi, baby girl!
Oh, God!

32:47.674 --> 32:51.052
Oh, I missed you so much, baby.
[sniffles] Okay.

32:52.178 --> 32:54.139
Thank you. [breathes heavily]

32:54.222 --> 32:56.016
[indistinct chatter on walkie-talkie]

33:04.816 --> 33:06.976
[reporter] Let's get this.
Right now they seem to be...

33:10.530 --> 33:12.115
[woman] They're all handcuffed.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.425
- [reporter] Over here!
- [indistinct chatter]

33:26.379 --> 33:28.715
Down. Down.

33:30.383 --> 33:33.178
Down. Stay right there. Down.

33:35.471 --> 33:36.973
[man] How many do you count?

33:39.726 --> 33:40.936
Is that smoke?

33:43.814 --> 33:44.815
Is that smoke?

33:46.399 --> 33:48.610
Holy shit! This is amazing.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.236
We're free!

33:50.320 --> 33:51.487
Well, we're still in prison.

33:51.572 --> 33:55.158
Yeah, but no more records.
Bye, bye, 19 shots! [chuckles]

33:55.241 --> 33:56.993
Yeah, I feel light.

33:57.077 --> 33:59.830
I've been reborn before,
but this is even better.

33:59.913 --> 34:01.915
[Angie] I can't wait to tell everybody.

34:01.998 --> 34:03.792
Dude, we're gonna be, like, heroes.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.547
We'll handle this.
Continue your sweep.

34:09.630 --> 34:10.841
You heard him.
Let's go.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.235
- [Angie yelps]
- Up against the wall, prisoners.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.512
Hey! Um, actually,
we're the good people.

34:16.597 --> 34:18.431
- [grunts]
- Yeah. You're fucking angels.

34:18.514 --> 34:20.891
Hands up, inmate.
We need FD in here.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.177
[man on walkie-talkie] <i>Copy.</i>
<i>Fire department on its way.</i>

34:26.231 --> 34:28.692
[indistinct chatter on walkie-talkie]

34:28.775 --> 34:30.054
That's all the dormitories, sir.

34:30.652 --> 34:31.652
Prison secure.

34:31.737 --> 34:34.864
<i>I repeat, prison secure.
We'll do one last sweep on our way out.</i>

34:34.947 --> 34:36.629
- Did he just say...
- The prison's secure.

34:36.658 --> 34:38.784
[sighs] Holy shit.

34:40.453 --> 34:41.536
No casualties?

34:42.455 --> 34:44.750
We don't have confirmation
of that just yet.

34:44.833 --> 34:47.168
- [Caputo sighs]
- I need to make a call to the governor.

34:48.003 --> 34:50.714
[exhales heavily]
I can't believe it's over.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.507
What a fucking nightmare.

34:56.011 --> 34:58.930
- What's going to happen to them now?
- [scoffs] Oh, Joe.

35:00.390 --> 35:03.059
Your heart bleeds the way
only a vagina should.

35:03.685 --> 35:05.520
- [indistinct chatter]
- [man] Get a picture!

35:05.604 --> 35:07.606

I love you! I'm okay!

35:42.223 --> 35:43.725

35:43.809 --> 35:46.102

I guess she would care if I die.

36:03.870 --> 36:05.288
[cries]

36:05.371 --> 36:07.207
I'm so sorry I left you, Lorn.

36:07.290 --> 36:10.376
- You believe me now?
- Yeah. You're pregnant!

36:10.460 --> 36:12.879
I can't believe you came back for me.

36:12.963 --> 36:15.882
I'm never gonna leave you again,
my little macaroni.

I love you!

36:29.312 --> 36:33.066
Excuse me, I... I work at MCC.
You have to get me out of here.

36:33.149 --> 36:34.210
If you talk to Joe Caputo, he'll...

36:34.234 --> 36:37.278
Yeah, I work at MCC too.
Help me! Help me!

36:37.362 --> 36:38.697
Yeah, I work at MCC too.

36:38.780 --> 36:39.882
- I work for MCC.
- [inmate 1] Me too.

36:39.906 --> 36:41.066
- I work for MCC!
- Work. MCC.

36:41.950 --> 36:43.368
- No. No, no.
- [inmate 2] Me too!

36:43.451 --> 36:46.037
One-oh-three, 104.

36:46.121 --> 36:49.207
- [gasps] Are you fucking kidding me?
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.

36:50.250 --> 36:53.503
Wait a minute, did I say sorry?
I meant go fuck yourself.

36:54.379 --> 36:57.173
- Get those confused sometimes. [chuckling]
- [inmates laughing]

37:03.805 --> 37:04.848
Hey! Hey! Hey!

37:06.432 --> 37:07.517
Whoo!

37:08.476 --> 37:10.237
- [laughing]
- [crowd cheering and whistling]

37:13.148 --> 37:16.276
[reporter on TV] <i>There's been a</i>
<i>big development at Litchfield Prison</i>

37:16.359 --> 37:18.737
<i>as female prisoners
have been escorted out...</i>

37:18.820 --> 37:24.159
Hey, Boo! Boo! Yes!
You're on TV! [chuckles]

37:25.035 --> 37:28.621
- [chuckles] Leanne? She's a stupid bitch.
- [reporter continues indistinctly]

37:28.704 --> 37:31.041
You're such a stupid bitch. [chuckles]

37:31.124 --> 37:33.877
Phew. Close call.
That was a close one.

37:36.337 --> 37:37.338
Nicky!

37:39.257 --> 37:42.218
Oh, thank God!
Where the hell have you been?

37:42.302 --> 37:45.013
- Hmm?
- Okay. Okay.

37:47.015 --> 37:48.975
- I had to make sure you're okay, right?
- Oh!

37:49.059 --> 37:50.476
Where's Lorna?

37:52.478 --> 37:53.814
Is she okay?

37:55.023 --> 37:56.024
Um...

37:57.400 --> 37:58.944
I think so. Yeah.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.906
We got some refugees upstairs.

38:03.824 --> 38:05.984
- Should we invite 'em down to the party?
- [Red sighs]

38:09.412 --> 38:11.497
Are you sure you don't want some?

38:12.332 --> 38:15.668
- Shit, I missed you.
- You know, can't blame you.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.297
- I'm very missable.
- [chuckles]

38:21.424 --> 38:24.302
Uh, hello?

38:25.053 --> 38:28.348
Man, don't you be going
all zombie on us now.

38:28.431 --> 38:30.976
It ain't like one of us
always got to be crazy.

38:31.059 --> 38:34.270
- I fucked it all up.
- [clicks tongue] Man, no, you didn't.

38:34.354 --> 38:37.065
Yeah, I did, man.

38:38.524 --> 38:40.986
- I did.
- [sighs]

38:41.069 --> 38:42.112
You said it.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.490
Man, look at this mess.

38:46.407 --> 38:48.284
They ain't gonna give us nothing now.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.162
I failed her.

38:52.372 --> 38:54.332
- I'm so fucking stupid!
- Ooh!

38:54.415 --> 38:59.420
Again... I'd like to point out
how a good night's rest

38:59.504 --> 39:02.548
might solve a myriad of emotional issues.

39:03.299 --> 39:06.219
You think your feelings are real,
but they're not.

39:06.302 --> 39:08.304
- [Taystee clicks tongue]
- Trust me.

39:08.388 --> 39:11.892
It's like...
it's like the sky is blue, right?

39:11.975 --> 39:14.269
But when there are clouds,
you think it's gray.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.472
But really, it's still blue.

39:16.312 --> 39:17.397
It hasn't changed.

39:18.231 --> 39:21.817
It's just covered
with gray clouds passing by.

39:23.278 --> 39:25.655
Now, the clouds are your feelings.

39:25.738 --> 39:28.033
The sky is how it really is.

39:29.409 --> 39:32.287
- Your clouds will pass by. You gonna...
- [panting]

39:33.329 --> 39:34.372
You okay?

39:35.165 --> 39:38.834
Yeah, I'm okay, but we ain't gonna be.

39:38.919 --> 39:40.799
There's some real bad shit
going down out there.

39:42.297 --> 39:43.882
[Black Cindy] Fuck.

39:43.965 --> 39:46.717
[man on TV] <i>...that we gotta get it built</i>
<i>and that's our priority...</i>

39:46.801 --> 39:49.721
- [vehicle approaching]
<i>- Rains come, we're gonna be screwed...</i>

39:49.804 --> 39:51.806
- [engine stops]
- [woman on TV] <i>I get it.</i>

39:51.890 --> 39:54.035
[man on TV] <i>All right, I just...</i>
<i>There's these little parasites</i>

39:54.059 --> 39:56.602
<i>or something that's all over the floor
and they're killing 'em.</i>

39:56.686 --> 39:58.367
[woman on TV] <i>Oh, God! I didn't see those.</i>

39:58.396 --> 40:00.207
[man on TV] <i>All right,</i>
<i>so what we're trying to do</i>

40:00.231 --> 40:03.818
<i>is we're gonna set up,
we can lash this together...</i>

40:05.736 --> 40:06.905
<i>Here, you wanna go do that?</i>

40:06.988 --> 40:09.782
- [woman on TV] <i>Yeah...</i>
- [gun cocks]

40:09.865 --> 40:11.177
[man on TV] <i>I don't know</i>
<i>if you have anything...</i>

40:11.201 --> 40:12.410
[indistinct chatter]

40:14.037 --> 40:17.248
Fuck. I can't wait to have
a nice juicy steak tonight.

40:17.332 --> 40:18.541
Mmm.

40:18.624 --> 40:20.793
[indistinct clamoring]

40:21.753 --> 40:23.838
We're ten short. [sighs]

40:24.839 --> 40:27.050
- What?
- I've got all my guys counting.

40:27.133 --> 40:29.385
We're consistently coming up
ten short every count.

40:29.469 --> 40:32.722
Then you need to go back in
and do another sweep.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.102
What the hell are you waiting for? Go.

40:37.185 --> 40:39.604
Ma'am, my men scoured the place. Twice.

40:39.687 --> 40:42.690
Wherever they are,
they're hiding strategically,

40:42.773 --> 40:44.534
which leads us to believe
they plan to fight.

40:44.567 --> 40:45.693
But where?

40:47.528 --> 40:48.529
The pool.

40:48.613 --> 40:50.406
- What?
- [Fig sighs]

40:50.490 --> 40:53.118
There's an old pool.
Hasn't been used in years.

40:53.201 --> 40:55.661
I always said we should
fill that fucking thing.

40:55.745 --> 40:57.122
Yeah. But you never did, did you?

40:58.456 --> 40:59.665
Neither did you.

40:59.749 --> 41:01.459
Can you tell us how to access it?

41:06.422 --> 41:07.422
Yes.

41:08.424 --> 41:11.719
We'll need the governor to sign off
on possible casualties, ma'am.

41:11.802 --> 41:13.013
Absolutely not.

41:13.096 --> 41:15.098
We'll do whatever we can to avoid them,

41:15.181 --> 41:17.600
but we have no idea what
these inmates might be armed with

41:17.683 --> 41:19.978
and I will not send
my men in there unarmed.

41:20.061 --> 41:23.189
- The governor will never sign off...
- He already signed off this morning.

41:27.527 --> 41:29.862
You tell him where the fucking pool is.

41:31.822 --> 41:33.033
[indistinct chatter on TV]

41:37.703 --> 41:39.164
- It's you.
- It's me.

41:39.247 --> 41:42.625
- Oh, my God. You found me.
- I found you.

41:42.708 --> 41:44.377
[Pennsatucky breathes deeply]

41:45.920 --> 41:46.921
- Hi.
- Hey.

41:47.005 --> 41:48.339
[Pennsatucky sighs]

41:51.426 --> 41:52.427
[sighs]

41:53.386 --> 41:54.762
- Whoa!
- I was, like, uh...

41:54.846 --> 41:55.722
Hey.

41:55.805 --> 41:57.925
Sitting there and was, like,
this noise was over...

41:57.973 --> 41:59.576
You think, maybe,
we could put the gun down?

41:59.600 --> 42:00.601
Oh, yeah.

42:01.310 --> 42:02.310
[gun clatters]

42:03.896 --> 42:05.023
[Coates chuckles]

42:07.650 --> 42:10.361
Hmm. Do you wanna watch TV?

42:11.696 --> 42:12.697
Yeah.

42:13.489 --> 42:16.159
Sure. We could watch... Yeah.

42:47.148 --> 42:48.441
[chuckles]

42:53.321 --> 42:54.364
[gasps] Oh!

42:56.074 --> 42:58.576
Y'all are fucking kidding
with this shit, right?

42:58.659 --> 43:01.454
- [Frieda laughs]
- Gloria, what's happening out there?

43:01.537 --> 43:04.249
They're arresting everybody.
Dragging everyone away. It's ugly.

43:05.541 --> 43:07.311
[Frieda] I got some mattresses
in the kiddie pool.

43:07.335 --> 43:09.837
They'll make a good barrier,
if we need 'em.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.005
<i>Frogger!</i>

43:11.672 --> 43:15.343
[scoffs] See, that's what we
needed for her...

43:15.426 --> 43:16.719
a goddamn playground!

43:20.348 --> 43:22.392
[video game beeping]

43:22.475 --> 43:23.684
T, what are you...

43:24.519 --> 43:25.520
[muffled breathing]

43:26.396 --> 43:27.397
[chuckles]

43:28.314 --> 43:31.817
Hey, don't mind him.
We'll give him back.

43:31.901 --> 43:35.155
Just an obstacle we encountered
along the way.

43:35.863 --> 43:36.906
It's your fault.

43:38.073 --> 43:39.992
- [grunts]
- Taystee!

43:40.075 --> 43:41.076
[muffled grunting]

43:46.916 --> 43:48.126
You!

43:50.586 --> 43:52.463
You're the reason Poussey is gone.

43:52.547 --> 43:55.049
- [Piscatella breathing raggedly]
- T, don't do this.

43:55.133 --> 43:57.385
They ain't never gonna give us Bayley.

43:58.761 --> 44:01.931
But now I got you.

44:03.183 --> 44:04.559
[grunts]

44:04.642 --> 44:05.643
[thuds]

44:06.769 --> 44:08.563
Say something!

44:11.357 --> 44:13.568
- Say something, God damn it.
- I'm sorry.

44:13.651 --> 44:15.695
[breathing shakily]

44:18.406 --> 44:19.532
That's all you got?

44:20.866 --> 44:21.992
You sorry?

44:23.203 --> 44:25.746
You think this is gonna
make you feel better?

44:25.830 --> 44:27.373
Go ahead, try it.

44:28.916 --> 44:29.917
But it won't.

44:31.461 --> 44:34.464
I promise you that.
I've been down this road.

44:36.674 --> 44:38.050
You don't wanna be like me.

44:41.596 --> 44:43.723
- You don't wanna be like...
- Shut up!

44:44.849 --> 44:47.185
Just trying to save your own damn life.

44:47.268 --> 44:48.269
[gun clicks]

44:51.439 --> 44:52.732
[Taystee crying]

45:02.242 --> 45:07.247
[sobbing] I miss her so much!

45:07.330 --> 45:08.706
I know. I know.

45:09.249 --> 45:13.961
I miss her so much!

45:14.044 --> 45:15.296
[sobbing loudly]

45:16.756 --> 45:17.757
[Black Cindy shushes]

45:19.967 --> 45:24.722
I got you. I got you, man.
[shushes gently] It's okay.

45:24.805 --> 45:26.599
Red, what are you doing?

45:31.061 --> 45:32.397
Enough.

45:38.235 --> 45:40.154
You walk out of here, yes?

45:44.784 --> 45:47.745
You don't touch anyone or anything.

45:56.128 --> 45:57.129
You go.

46:01.384 --> 46:02.802
- [gun cocks]
- [Suzanne gasps]

46:02.885 --> 46:04.762
[panting]

46:41.841 --> 46:43.008
[Piscatella sniffles]

46:46.011 --> 46:47.763
[Nicky sighs]

46:53.769 --> 46:55.605
[indistinct chatter on walkie-talkie]

47:11.245 --> 47:13.456
- The hell is going on here?
- Nothing good.

47:22.465 --> 47:24.345
[whispers]
Where do you think they're taking us?

47:24.384 --> 47:26.010
Why aren't they out here yet?

47:28.095 --> 47:29.138
I don't know.

47:31.807 --> 47:33.910
[officer] Entrance should be
50 feet ahead on the left.

47:33.934 --> 47:36.020
Targets assumed to be immediately inside.

47:41.484 --> 47:42.777
[officers speaking indistinctly]

47:44.737 --> 47:46.447
[Piscatella] Hey. [grunts]

48:03.088 --> 48:04.089
Oh, my God.

48:04.173 --> 48:06.842
- What now?
- We sure as shit ain't got enough guns.

48:06.926 --> 48:08.135
What if we just start yelling?

48:08.719 --> 48:11.346
I mean, they'll hear us, right?
We'll just yell that we surrender.

48:11.431 --> 48:12.682
Little late for that.

48:12.765 --> 48:15.476
[exclaims] Would anyone else like a turn?

48:15.560 --> 48:17.937
It's like reality, only fake.

48:18.020 --> 48:19.939
Goddamn, I wish I was high.

48:20.022 --> 48:21.732
Frieda, what do we do?

48:25.528 --> 48:27.196
We keep our dignity.

48:34.411 --> 48:36.789
[Taystee breathing raggedly]

48:40.417 --> 48:42.169
[man] Move it up, ladies. Single file.

48:43.253 --> 48:46.256
Seriously, what the fuck is happening?

48:46.340 --> 48:48.551
Maybe they're sending us to Max?

48:48.634 --> 48:49.969
Oh. Thank God.

48:50.052 --> 48:52.853
They'll see I don't have paperwork
or a record or anything then, right?

48:53.347 --> 48:57.893
It ain't Max. There ain't enough
fucking space for all of us down there.

48:57.977 --> 49:01.063
I think I'm hyperventilating again.
[breathing heavily]

49:01.146 --> 49:02.607
Yo, am I gonna go blind?

49:02.690 --> 49:03.733
Are you okay?

49:03.816 --> 49:06.401
- Yeah. Right. I don't know.
- Yo. You could fucking sue them.

49:06.485 --> 49:08.529
Damn. No, no, no. We're together.

49:08.612 --> 49:10.132
- You can write letters.
- No. Letters?

49:10.156 --> 49:12.408
What are you talking about?
No, where are we going?

49:12.491 --> 49:15.172
You think they're gonna let
any of you back in there after all this?

49:15.202 --> 49:16.328
[Flaca crying]

49:16.411 --> 49:18.163
[indistinct chatter on walkie-talkie]

49:28.633 --> 49:31.636
Don't worry, pretty.
One prison's just like another, right?

49:43.188 --> 49:44.815
Maritza! [cries]

49:44.899 --> 49:45.941
It's okay.

49:48.235 --> 49:50.445
- I love you!
- [continues crying]

50:09.131 --> 50:10.611
[officer] Someone get a pulse on him.

50:11.759 --> 50:13.594
[Natoli stammers] I didn't mean to...

50:17.097 --> 50:18.140
There's no pulse.

50:18.223 --> 50:21.894
[stammers] I did aim for the ceiling, sir.
He's so tall and he caught us by surprise.

50:21.977 --> 50:23.520
Motherfuck.

50:56.303 --> 50:57.722
[inhales sharply]

51:04.645 --> 51:06.396
