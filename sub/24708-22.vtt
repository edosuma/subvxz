How's it going?

00:32.907 --> 00:37.037
We expect you'll be contacted
this morning by Sergeant
Martens's superior at I.A.B.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.330
Lieutenant Shannon.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.416
We want you to agree
to an interview.

00:41.416 --> 00:44.419
If Lieutenant Shannon asks,

00:44.419 --> 00:48.089
you acknowledge you know
Joey Salvo, but you refuse
to cooperate further.

00:48.089 --> 00:49.674
You wanna see if
he takes that to Salvo?

00:49.674 --> 00:52.260
-Is Shannon who
you're looking at?
-You do your part, Detective.

00:52.260 --> 00:55.263
-We'll figure out where
the pieces fit together.
-Hey, asshole.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.974
My interviewer yesterday
asked me about Salvo.

01:00.727 --> 01:03.772
-Sergeant Martens asked you?
-Yes, that's right.

01:03.772 --> 01:08.026
So Martens, knowing
about this operation,
he didn't go back to Salvo.

01:08.026 --> 01:11.446
You don't pick that up
on your bug. So Martens is
off your worry list, right?

01:11.446 --> 01:14.032
Lieutenant Shannon should
be calling at the
beginning of the shift.

01:14.032 --> 01:16.868
If he takes it
back to Salvo,
I'm done here.

01:16.868 --> 01:20.038
Well, that'd be a big thing
for us, finding out who's
giving information to Salvo.

01:20.038 --> 01:23.041
Yeah, so that you can say,
"I didn't actually say
you were done."

01:23.041 --> 01:25.919
I'm tellin' you,
this guy bites, I'm done.

01:29.422 --> 01:32.092
That's my lieutenant's copy--

01:32.092 --> 01:34.511
what I did
and who asked me.

01:34.511 --> 01:37.722
He bites, I'm done.

01:37.722 --> 01:42.685
-You could use some rest.
-I stayed up late making sure
I got everything right.

01:42.685 --> 01:45.021
Lieutenant.

01:50.485 --> 01:53.279
-You mind holding on to that?
-No.

01:53.279 --> 01:56.741
If you want, I'll verify
the sequence and sign it.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.705
-You would do that?
-Yeah.

Yes. I-I stopped to help someone
on one of your city's fair
streets...

05:31.039 --> 05:32.915

for my troubles.

05:32.915 --> 05:35.293
-I'm sorry that happened.
What's your name?
-John Highsmith.

-How do you do,
Mr. Highsmith?
-Come on.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.977
How badly did you get hurt,
Mr. Highsmith?

05:52.977 --> 05:56.939
Why? Must I pass
some suffering test before
you'll act on my complaint?

05:56.939 --> 06:00.943
Uh, we're-we're taking
the complaint. It determines
how we write it up.

06:00.943 --> 06:02.945
Every bone in my body
is broken.

06:02.945 --> 06:06.324
Those kids sure didn't hurt
your smart mouth too much,
did they, Mr. Highsmith?

06:06.324 --> 06:10.953
We understand you're upset.
Uh, it's not gonna help anything
taking a lousy attitude.

06:10.953 --> 06:13.956
I was on my way
to the Public Theater.
About 50 feet ahead of me...

06:13.956 --> 06:18.169
a young black man began
screaming that his friend
was having an epileptic fit.

06:18.169 --> 06:21.964
As I hurried to help, the one
who was screaming suddenly
grabbed his hand back,

06:21.964 --> 06:24.634
looking as if he'd
been bitten by the boy
who was having a seizure.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.512
All right. And-And the guy
who was bitten asked you
for something...

06:27.512 --> 06:30.598
to put in his friend's mouth
to keep him from swallowing
his tongue?

06:30.598 --> 06:34.018
I gave my wallet
to the one boy who
wasn't having a seizure.

06:34.018 --> 06:36.896
Then the victim--
the one on the ground--
suddenly kicked me.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.940
The other one struck me
on the back of the neck.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.109
And as I lay there
on the ground,

06:41.109 --> 06:43.694
they both kicked me
again and again.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.115
Completely gratuitous.

06:47.115 --> 06:50.034
-Did you get a decent look
at these guys?
-Black.

06:50.034 --> 06:53.371
Punks. Teenagers.

06:53.371 --> 06:56.082
Maybe learned
their stomping techniques
inside these walls.

06:56.082 --> 07:00.211
-What?
-How do you intend
to proceed, gentlemen?

07:00.211 --> 07:03.506
-What did you say
just a minute ago?
-Sorry. I've had a bad morning.

07:03.506 --> 07:07.176
Not quite up to the
misrepresentation of my feelings
that would get you on board.

07:08.845 --> 07:12.265
Here's where
I can be reached.

07:12.265 --> 07:16.060
I absolutely intend
to press charges.

07:16.060 --> 07:19.856
Greg, this is the magazine that
wrote we were like a third world
country's police force.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.775
Yes, I was waiting
for this part.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.027
Oh, yes. Huh.

07:25.027 --> 07:27.989
I don't read your magazine,
but our local papers
did excerpts,

07:27.989 --> 07:31.993
-shorten the words up.
-Mmm. Proud proletarian
ignorance.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.287
We better be extra careful
if we collar these guys.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.790
-Protect their rights.
-So do I forget about
retrieving my wallet?

07:37.790 --> 07:40.835
Oh, not at all,
Mr. Highsmith.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.588
Uh, we'll try and stop
the beatings and
bribe-taking...

07:43.588 --> 07:46.466
long enough to see
if we can track it down.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.469

straightened away, huh?

-I'm for that.
-Good.

I've been through your file.
You're not a wrong cop.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.953

without authorization.
Came up no hits,

08:15.953 --> 08:18.289
covered, issued
to another agency.

you keeping up
your computer skills?

08:23.044 --> 08:25.421
I got nothin' past what I told
Sergeant Martens.

08:25.421 --> 08:28.925
Hmm. Which was nothing.

08:28.925 --> 08:32.720
The loan-out agency's the F.B.I.
The operation's on a halfway
hooked-up, stickup guy,

08:32.720 --> 08:36.933
Joe Salvo--
first collar's in the 27
when he was 17.

08:36.933 --> 08:42.104
-You found all that out, huh?
-Yeah. Where you grew up--

08:42.104 --> 08:47.318
-You know Joe Salvo, Bobby?
-Yeah, I do.

08:47.318 --> 08:51.113
Was Salvo worried someone had
him up? Asked you, old times,
would you run that plate?

08:51.113 --> 08:53.824
I knew Joe Salvo growing up.

08:53.824 --> 08:56.494
I got nothin' to say
to the rest of it.

08:56.494 --> 08:59.497
Pretty innocent request,
asking you to run a plate
for him.

08:59.497 --> 09:03.751
Maybe he told you it was about
romance. No one's to say you
knew what his act was anymore.

09:03.751 --> 09:07.964
-I got nothin' more to say.
-No matter how much
that hurts you?

09:07.964 --> 09:10.550
I'm from the street too,
Bobby.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.970

you feel, but this ain't
the street no more.

some respect, Lieutenant?

-How's it going with you?

10:33.049 --> 10:35.468
Half a chance,
maybe this thing'll let up.

10:35.468 --> 10:39.555
-Is that right, Bobby?
-Yeah. Maybe these people
just got what they wanted.

10:39.555 --> 10:41.641
SIPOWICZ:
Maybe these people did, huh?

10:41.641 --> 10:46.062
-Maybe these people
are the C.I.A.?
-Busted.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.439
So if these people
got what they want,
maybe we get...

10:48.439 --> 10:50.983
a copious rundown
what the hell
has been goin' on.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.944

My name is Herbert Wentzel.
I'm a physician.

Detective Simone.
How can I help you?

11:12.463 --> 11:16.676
I'm a psychiatrist.
I'm concerned about a patient,
Christina Lakos.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.180
Why?

11:21.681 --> 11:26.435
I believe Miss Lakos is gravely
at risk by her own hand
or from a loved one.

11:26.435 --> 11:30.481
Unless I'm certain
a crime's intended or
actually has taken place,

11:30.481 --> 11:32.817
I can't disclose
the basis of my concerns.

11:32.817 --> 11:37.071
How would you suggest we act
on those, uh, concerns?

11:37.071 --> 11:39.281
What I can tell you
is that she missed
her last appointment.

11:39.281 --> 11:43.661
I would talk to
her loved ones.
I believe this is...

11:43.661 --> 11:45.538
the sister's phone number
and also her father's.

11:50.126 --> 11:54.505
-He lives in
a different place?
-I would talk to both of them.

11:54.505 --> 11:58.718
-Ask her whereabouts?
-Form impressions of them
based on your conversations...

11:58.718 --> 12:00.553
to see if she was
really at risk.

12:03.097 --> 12:06.142
Thanks for the heads-up.

12:06.142 --> 12:09.145
It wasn't a happy mission.

12:09.145 --> 12:12.982
Maybe it'll turn out
she blew the appointment
to, uh, go shopping.

12:12.982 --> 12:17.236
Detective,
I'm not sanguine that
that'll be the outcome.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.289

Got reason to believe
she's in danger.

Tell him there's
a reason to believe
she's suffocated dead...

coming out of her mouth?

12:35.212 --> 12:37.173
I didn't wanna give that up
to him yet.

-Could've been.

'Cause he was laying that
doctor-patient privilege stuff
on pretty thick.

Want me to hang up?

this morning?

13:55.543 --> 13:57.795
-(speaking Greek)
-Not this morning.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.840
Christine missed
a doctor's appointment
this morning.

14:00.840 --> 14:05.469
Uh, psychiatrist.
Six-figure income.
Spend money for that, huh?

14:05.469 --> 14:09.515
-What do you do
for a living, sir?
-Plumber.

14:09.515 --> 14:10.850
My back's hurt.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.060
Did you and your daughter
have some kind of dispute?

14:13.060 --> 14:15.437
You said that she only
talks to her mother.

14:15.437 --> 14:17.231
Well, how a daughter
and mother talk.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.275
She comes for dinner.
I see her then.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.569
Get out if you don't say
what you are doing.

14:24.822 --> 14:29.243
We're sorry
to have to tell you this,
Mr. and Mrs. Lakos.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.453
Christine was involved
in a violent incident
this morning.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.289
-MR. LAKOS:
Oh, my God.
-She was found dead.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.791
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

14:35.791 --> 14:40.671
-(cries, speaks Greek)
-(cries)

14:40.671 --> 14:43.716
-MR. LAKOS:
Who hurt her?
-We're trying to find out.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.467
Who hurt my child?

14:45.467 --> 14:50.180
(Greek)

14:50.180 --> 14:52.182
-Is my other child alive?
-(Mrs. Lakos crying)

14:52.182 --> 14:54.727
-We're going to talk to her now.
-SIMONE:
We're sure she is.

14:54.727 --> 15:00.441
Mr. Lakos, we're gonna to
have to ask you not to
contact your daughter until
we've spoken to her first.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.026
Why don't I stay here?

15:04.153 --> 15:05.905
We're sorry for
your loss, sir.

15:07.489 --> 15:08.574
Who hurt my child?

15:08.574 --> 15:12.119
(Greek)

15:17.207 --> 15:22.004
(laughing) Playin'
basketball's a crime now,
the way them guys swooped on us.

15:22.004 --> 15:26.675
-You ever hear of school, Jamal?
-Oh! So you guys must be
the truant officers.

15:26.675 --> 15:30.387
-Yeah, we're truant officers.
-Or was it them guys
that picked us up?

15:30.387 --> 15:32.389
Those were cops from
Special Frauds, Jamal.

15:32.389 --> 15:36.435
And you and Warren are collars
for the same crap they
popped you for twice already.

15:36.435 --> 15:40.606
Yo, I thought they was
health cops. You know, pop my
boy Warren for being epileptic.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.734
-(laughing)
-Youthful offender.

15:43.734 --> 15:46.904
-You think you're Superman,
right, Jamal?
-A real nice cape...

15:46.904 --> 15:49.615
his first stretch at Rikers
once he's bent over
and busted open.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.368
(laughing)

15:53.369 --> 15:55.329
(shutter clicks)

15:55.329 --> 16:00.125
-Hey, he can't do that
without our permission.
-Hey, Warren, permission this.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.092
-Very grateful.
-Sure.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.721
-How's it going,
Mr. Highsmith?
-MEDAVOY: We can talk here.

16:18.018 --> 16:21.563
-Right there, sir.
-(coughs)

16:24.525 --> 16:27.653
We've, uh, contacted
our Special Frauds unit,

16:27.653 --> 16:29.905
described your complaint.

16:29.905 --> 16:32.783
They picked two kids up
work that hustle
in that general area.

16:32.783 --> 16:35.869
-I see.
-We had 'em brought over.
They're locked up down the hall
there.

16:35.869 --> 16:39.748
-Well, shall we see
if I identify them?
-We can't really do that.

16:39.748 --> 16:42.167
These kids are pretty wise.
They won't agree to a lineup.

16:42.167 --> 16:45.170
And if we even ask,
they'll lawyer up.

16:45.170 --> 16:48.841
Being they're minors,
we're not even allowed to keep
their photographs on file.

16:48.841 --> 16:53.178
Have you brought me here
to expose me to your scalding
constitutional ironies?

16:53.178 --> 16:56.432
Our point more was
to let you know we happen
to got photos of these kids.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.643
You picking 'em out
isn't gonna send them
to prison or anything,

16:59.643 --> 17:02.396
but if we know it's them,
at least we can try
and get your wallet back.

17:02.396 --> 17:05.357
Well, yes. Yes, I would
like to get it back.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.609
Certain personal effects.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.987
Any money left,
maybe you could buy
a self-improvement tape,

17:09.987 --> 17:12.865
Bein' Nicer So Other People
Don't Wanna Hit You
With a Brick.

17:12.865 --> 17:16.076
(chuckles)
Are you going to show me
the pictures?

17:19.413 --> 17:22.499
Look through these.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.209
These are the two.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.838
Are those they?

17:27.838 --> 17:31.425
-Are those the two
you have in custody?
-Yes, those are they.

17:33.385 --> 17:36.388
Go spread some cheer
elsewhere, Mr. Highsmith.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.223
We'll let you know if
we get your wallet back.

17:42.478 --> 17:46.356
-Hey, boss.
-Hey, um, that psychiatrist
is waiting for you upstairs.

17:46.356 --> 17:47.900
Yeah, we'll need to talk
further with him.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.569
Hard to like
the D.O.A.'s old man
for being involved.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.238
-Where this doctor
was pointing you?
-The father was pretty torn up.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.032
Anything off
the D.O.A.'s sister?

17:55.032 --> 17:59.036
Some kind of buyer
at a department store.
She was gone,

17:59.036 --> 18:01.455
-but we'll try again this
afternoon.
-Russell was with the
parents...

18:01.455 --> 18:05.042
so we could keep
the sister's notification fresh,
but we told her to come back.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.503
Diane's already upstairs.

18:07.503 --> 18:10.089
You know she drives
like a maniac?

18:10.089 --> 18:11.924
I got your message.
Is there news?

18:11.924 --> 18:14.301
Why don't we talk
in here, Doc?

18:18.263 --> 18:22.226
You were clocked
going 87 miles an hour
coming back here.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.898
You can have a seat
right here.

18:27.898 --> 18:31.068
This is quite a consignment
of man and woman power.

18:32.486 --> 18:36.198
Well, Doctor,
you were right that
Miss Lakos was in danger.

18:36.198 --> 18:39.493
-We found her body
a little while ago.
-Oh, no.

18:39.493 --> 18:44.289
This type of situation,
department likes to use as much
man and woman power as they can.

18:44.289 --> 18:49.211
This is what I was afraid of.
I was literally getting sick
over this possibility.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.505
SIMONE: Well,
knowing something has happened
to Miss Lakos, Doctor,

18:51.505 --> 18:55.134
would you mind telling us
a little more about
why you were so worried?

18:55.134 --> 19:00.556
Absolutely. This takes
the ethical gloves off
to a much greater extent.

19:00.556 --> 19:05.769
This was a deeply depressed
26-year-old female with
a history of family abuse.

19:05.769 --> 19:09.731
-Abusive how?
-Incestuous contact
with the male parent...

19:09.731 --> 19:12.734
over a protracted period,
strongly repressed.

19:12.734 --> 19:15.737
I hate to use a lot
of professional jargon,

19:15.737 --> 19:20.784
but there's a nexus
between depth of repression
and degree of depression.

19:20.784 --> 19:26.123
-She was suicidal?
-We'd identified and were
addressing these cathexes...

19:26.123 --> 19:28.125
in an increasingly
positive fashion.

19:28.125 --> 19:31.336
But she absolutely had
the capacity to kill herself.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.547
-And how do you think
she'd have done that?
-Obviously,

19:33.547 --> 19:37.384
to the extent
her self-hatred was generated
by her childhood experiences,

19:37.384 --> 19:40.637
she would feel enormous anger
towards her father.

19:40.637 --> 19:45.142
She might detail her grievances
in a letter that she would
certain would be found.

19:45.142 --> 19:49.396
Her father's a plumber.
You think she might
swallow drain cleaner?

19:49.396 --> 19:51.773
Oh, that's remarkable.

19:51.773 --> 19:55.652
Is that what she did?
That is heartbreaking
and remarkable.

19:55.652 --> 19:58.572
As far as
the medical examiner can tell,

19:58.572 --> 20:01.158
the biggest remarkable thing
about that was her doing that...

20:01.158 --> 20:04.578
after she suffocated herself.

20:04.578 --> 20:06.788
The drain cleaner was
introduced postmortem?

20:06.788 --> 20:10.667
Someone did the introductions
after they croaked her.

20:10.667 --> 20:14.171
-Not much latent content
in that, is there?
-What did you say, Doctor?

20:14.171 --> 20:18.884
If someone were
to be guilty of a crime
in a moment of passion,

20:18.884 --> 20:21.428
and then be filled
with self-recrimination
and regrets,

20:21.428 --> 20:24.640
there wouldn't be a much more
dramatic way to point
the authorities to himself...

20:24.640 --> 20:28.852
as the crime's perpetrator
than putting drain cleaner
down his daughter's throat.

20:28.852 --> 20:32.022
You're saying
her father did the murder.
And since he was a plumber,

20:32.022 --> 20:36.318
what he did afterwards
with the drain cleaner, that
was a way of him confessing?

20:36.318 --> 20:40.197
Under these circumstances,
I think the canons of my
profession would not preclude...

20:40.197 --> 20:44.409
my saying that I think
the finger of suspicion
points to Christine's father.

20:44.409 --> 20:48.789
-So that would be a yes?
-(sighs)

21:00.217 --> 21:04.388
-(phone ringing)
-(siren wailing in distance)

21:09.017 --> 21:11.937
Thanks for coming in,
Doctor. We'll let you know
what develops.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.647
-You must promise to do that.
-Go on. Get out of here.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.774
Yeah, we promise.

21:27.160 --> 21:31.373
-You all right?
-It's bad.
(grunts)

21:42.718 --> 21:46.763
Detective, you're under
suspension. I need your gun,
your shield and your I.D.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.726
What are the charges?

21:50.726 --> 21:53.478
You'll be served
with the charges before
the trial commissioner.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.991
You got a second gun
on your 10 card.

22:09.578 --> 22:12.289
Yeah, the second gun
is in my locker.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.416
I'm gonna go get it with him.

22:25.302 --> 22:27.971
What happened?
I did what they wanted.

22:27.971 --> 22:30.974
I don't know, Bobby.
I don't know.

22:34.603 --> 22:37.606
-What are they doin' to you?
-I'm suspended, Andy.

22:38.648 --> 22:40.275
Why?

22:41.318 --> 22:43.612
I didn't do nothin' wrong.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.749
I'll tell you what, boss.
I'm gonna tell you something
right now.

22:55.749 --> 22:58.877
This had to be what
they wanted and where
they were going all along.

22:58.877 --> 23:00.921
(panting)

23:05.008 --> 23:08.220
Now they got me sat down.

23:11.807 --> 23:14.643
They're gonna be comin' back
at me with somethin' more.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.440
(sighs)

23:21.775 --> 23:22.609
(slams)

23:24.820 --> 23:29.866
♪♪

23:35.580 --> 23:39.000
(chattering)

23:39.000 --> 23:41.795
So you want to take it?
Set up a feminine rapport?

23:41.795 --> 23:44.047
How about we see how it
lays out with her, Andy?

23:44.047 --> 23:48.051
-Yeah. Excuse me
for trying to have a plan.
-Andy, stop it.

23:48.051 --> 23:52.222
Excuse me. Detectives.
We're looking for Anna Lakos.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.224
May I help you?

23:54.224 --> 23:56.560
-Miss Lakos?
-Yes?

23:58.603 --> 24:03.358
I'm Detective Russell. This is
Detective Sipowicz. Is there
some place we could talk?

24:03.358 --> 24:06.236
-What's it about?
-Have you been in touch
with your parents, Miss Lakos?

24:06.236 --> 24:09.030
-No.
-Could we talk somewhere
more private?

24:09.030 --> 24:11.533
Please. Just tell me.

24:11.533 --> 24:14.244
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this,
but your sister, Christine,

24:14.244 --> 24:16.204
was the victim of a homicide
this morning.

24:17.372 --> 24:20.667
(crying)
No.

24:23.920 --> 24:27.340
-Do that someplace else.
-Can I get you some water?

24:27.340 --> 24:30.177
(crying continues)

24:30.177 --> 24:33.054
-What happened?
RUSSELL:
Miss Lakos,

24:33.054 --> 24:36.141
you haven't spoken
with your parents in
the last four or five hours?

24:36.141 --> 24:38.310
-No.
-We notified them
this morning.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.979
We thought by now
they would have contacted you.

24:40.979 --> 24:43.648
-Did you tell them
not to?
-More or less but--

24:43.648 --> 24:47.736
If you told them not to,
they wouldn't.

24:47.736 --> 24:50.906
-Who hurt her?
-It's not clear right now.

24:50.906 --> 24:54.284
-(crying continues)
-Did she have any enemies?

24:54.284 --> 24:57.287
Somebody she didn't
get along with? A boyfriend
or something like that?

24:57.287 --> 25:00.081
My sister was raped
six months ago.

25:00.081 --> 25:03.752
She hadn't had
a boyfriend since.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.087
Was her attacker caught?

25:06.087 --> 25:10.425
She didn't bring charges
because she didn't want
our father...

25:10.425 --> 25:13.595
to find out
what had happened.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.431
Did she know her attacker?
Could he have done this
to her too?

25:16.431 --> 25:19.518
It was someone
she worked with.
He moved to Seattle.

25:19.518 --> 25:24.356
I have to be with my parents.
I don't--I don't think my dad
can live through this.

25:24.356 --> 25:27.442
Did she talk to you
about seeing a psychiatrist?

25:28.693 --> 25:34.449
A-A little.
She was hurt so badly
by what had happened.

25:34.449 --> 25:38.411
-RUSSELL: Emotionally?
-Yeah. It had just torn up
her feelings about herself.

25:38.411 --> 25:41.498
I don't know if a doctor
could've done her any good.

25:41.498 --> 25:46.127
I'm sorry. I can't help you.
I have to go be with my family.

25:46.127 --> 25:50.423
You've been a lot of help.
We're so sorry for your loss.

25:57.889 --> 26:01.017
-Hey, Gina.
-Hey.

26:01.017 --> 26:04.604
Detective, I don't know what
they're saying, but I know
you wouldn't do anything wrong.

26:04.604 --> 26:09.317
-Thanks. Where's the boss?
-In the lavatory.

26:09.317 --> 26:11.695
And those F.B.I. sons of bitches
are in the coffee room.

26:12.904 --> 26:15.282
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

26:15.282 --> 26:19.119
-Anything we can do, Bobby?
-It's gotta sort
itself out, Greg.

26:19.119 --> 26:20.954
As far as that goes, they gotta
sort theirselves out.

26:20.954 --> 26:24.624
'Cause there's no chance
in the world this is anything
but a hummer beef.

26:24.624 --> 26:26.293
So where are you
with those juveniles?

26:26.293 --> 26:28.878
The victim made a photo I.D.
that's inadmissible.

26:28.878 --> 26:31.047
These kids are too smart
to stand in a lineup.

26:31.047 --> 26:36.803
We'll let 'em go. Cool 'em out
a little more before we try
for the guy's wallet.

26:36.803 --> 26:38.638
Bobby.

26:38.638 --> 26:41.016
F.B.I.'s in there.

26:41.016 --> 26:44.603
-The other shoe, huh?
-Yeah. You want me
to bring 'em in here?

26:44.603 --> 26:47.314
-Uh-uh. Let 'em
make their play.
-Okay.

27:01.536 --> 27:04.080
-I can't believe
they suspended you.
-Yeah.

27:04.080 --> 27:07.876
And if you pissed in my ear, you
would tell me it was raining.
The guy that suspended me,

27:07.876 --> 27:10.795
-that's the same guy you're
looking at for being wrong.
-I know.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.048
-What the hell does that mean?
-We're not a hundred percent
sure.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.717
You're not--
You're not sure?

27:15.717 --> 27:17.886
That Shannon could
move against you so fast...

27:17.886 --> 27:20.597
makes us wonder if Salvo's
got a second hook.

27:23.975 --> 27:26.061
Oh, man. Oh, man.

27:30.148 --> 27:34.277
You are getting your job back.
I promised you that.

27:35.153 --> 27:39.240
You see, this is
on the street now.

27:39.240 --> 27:42.160
If I get my job back,

27:42.160 --> 27:45.246
people out there
are always gonna wonder
did I cut a deal.

27:47.499 --> 27:51.503
Was he a wrong guy
and did he just rat somebody out
to save his ass?

27:51.503 --> 27:55.632
When you get back on the job,
believe me, we'll do some
spin control for you.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.759
Just shut up, man!
Just--

27:57.759 --> 28:01.638
(breathes deeply)
You shut up.

28:11.439 --> 28:13.441
Oh.

28:20.865 --> 28:23.493
As long as it's fallen
like this--

28:23.493 --> 28:26.788
you suspended,
Salvo's I.A.B. hook...

28:26.788 --> 28:28.790
telling him
you're a stand-up guy--

28:28.790 --> 28:31.793
we figure you could snuggle up
with Joe now pretty good.

28:31.793 --> 28:34.003
(laughs)

28:36.172 --> 28:38.717
Yeah, that's what
I figured you'd figure.

28:41.344 --> 28:43.722
Your call, of course.

28:51.104 --> 28:54.858
Y'all wanna play like this,
man, we gotta appear
before a magistrate.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.317
-(laughing)
MARTINEZ:
Keep running it, Jamal.

28:56.317 --> 28:59.112
-We'll take a look at
how many years you've been 15.
-Yo, go ahead.

28:59.112 --> 29:02.157
-Check my
birth certificate, man.
-Yeah. Where's it going anyway?

29:02.157 --> 29:04.117
We ain't do nothin' wrong.

29:04.117 --> 29:07.954
Maybe you're not too keen
on having your certificate
looked at too, huh, Warren?

29:07.954 --> 29:12.125
All we're looking for is a
little cooperation, if you guys
would stop stylin' for a minute.

29:12.125 --> 29:14.711
-Well, let's hear it.
-A guy we know lost his wallet.

29:14.711 --> 29:18.173
We're not looking
to jam anyone for that,
put anything in evidence.

29:18.173 --> 29:21.760
All we want is an idea
where you guys would guess--

29:21.760 --> 29:23.803
-(yawns)
-if someone like that
did lose a wallet,

29:23.803 --> 29:26.097
where would we go
to look for it?

29:26.097 --> 29:28.600
Yo, I don't what
y'all talkin' about.

29:30.685 --> 29:33.563
When the guy lose it?

29:33.563 --> 29:35.732
Yesterday,
around the Public Theater.

29:35.732 --> 29:38.443
Gave it up to a guy
stopping his friend's seizure.

29:38.443 --> 29:42.572
Guy whose wallet it was
forgot to ask for it back.

29:42.572 --> 29:47.368
There's an open building around
the corner on Fourth Street.
It has an empty basement.

29:47.368 --> 29:49.913
We could look there.
Guy might still have
his personal effects.

29:49.913 --> 29:52.290
Might--Might be down there.

29:54.918 --> 29:58.171
Yeah, well, you know,
nobody put a gun
to my head, right?

29:58.171 --> 30:01.800
Yeah, sure.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.261
Same place as before.
Yeah.

30:07.096 --> 30:09.641
Good.

30:09.641 --> 30:14.020
-Get my second gun back?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'll get it back.

30:14.020 --> 30:17.398
Look, Lieu, uh,
you don't wanna hear me
tell 'em what's going on,

30:17.398 --> 30:19.609
you ought to walk away.

30:19.609 --> 30:21.277
Do what you feel is right.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.867
Who brought you back?

30:27.867 --> 30:30.203
F.B.I. scumbags.

30:32.247 --> 30:35.208
So me and Diane,
we're out at dinner.

30:35.208 --> 30:38.002
-This guy Joey Salvo sends
over a bottle of wine.
-The stickup guy?

30:38.002 --> 30:40.421
Which me and him
know each other
growing up.

30:40.421 --> 30:42.632
Turns out the F.B.I.
has him up.

30:42.632 --> 30:44.884
They asked me to cooperate
if Salvo tries to reach out.

30:44.884 --> 30:48.263
-Job says what?
-Do what the F.B.I. wants.

30:48.263 --> 30:51.057
So Salvo reaches out
for a pedigree on a plate.
I run the plate.

30:51.057 --> 30:54.686
Boom. Here comes
Martens from I.A.B.
"Why did you run the plate?"

30:54.686 --> 30:57.355
But it don't bother me,
'cause I know the job's
got my back.

30:57.355 --> 31:00.483
-Oh, yeah.
-Come to find out
the job is looking...

31:00.483 --> 31:02.944
with F.B.I., does Salvo
have a hook at the Rat Squad?

31:02.944 --> 31:06.823
But they can't tell the Rat
Squad to back off of me. That
would tip Salvo that he's up.

31:06.823 --> 31:08.825
So Bobby gets
suspended instead.

31:08.825 --> 31:12.328
Where do these
F.B.I. pricks get the balls
to call you back in?

31:12.328 --> 31:16.666
They wanted to let me know--
since I'm out on my ass anyway--

31:16.666 --> 31:20.253
they think that my best
next move would be to turn
the sheets down with Salvo.

31:20.253 --> 31:23.047
Oh. They were taking you there
all the time, Bobby.

31:23.047 --> 31:26.718
They knew if you had any choice,
you wouldn't go as far
as they wanted with Salvo.

31:26.718 --> 31:30.513
Two of you went over
the ins and outs of this thing
pretty thoroughly, huh?

31:30.513 --> 31:32.682
They said I could tell
one person, Andy.

31:34.517 --> 31:37.937
(clears throat)
You done letting 'em tell you
what you can and can't do now?

31:40.064 --> 31:42.567
But I'm not done letting 'em
think they can.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.778
-(footsteps approaching)
-SIPOWICZ: What the hell
do you want, Martens?

31:45.778 --> 31:49.282
(clears throat)
I'm suspended.

31:49.282 --> 31:51.534
-SIPOWICZ:
You're suspended?
-Is that right?

31:51.534 --> 31:54.287
Yeah. They said someone's
wrong in our unit.

31:54.287 --> 31:55.872
They don't wanna tip him
he's hot.

31:55.872 --> 31:58.708
I get suspended so
the wrong guy drops his guard.

31:58.708 --> 32:02.253
-'Cause they know I'm right.
-Where is justice, huh?

32:02.253 --> 32:05.340
You can tell me who
they're looking at.

32:05.340 --> 32:08.509
It's a tough situation.
I don't think I can help.

32:14.307 --> 32:16.976
Well, don't your heart bleed?

32:21.940 --> 32:25.485
♪♪

32:35.119 --> 32:37.664
-You wanna see if that's yours?
-HIGHSMITH:
Yes.

32:43.044 --> 32:44.545
Yes. Yes, it's mine.

32:44.545 --> 32:48.174
-Hank, could you release
those punks in the pokey?
-Sure.

32:48.174 --> 32:50.593
-Family photos, you see.
-Uh-huh.

32:50.593 --> 32:53.596
Still a big money wad
in there when we found it,
but we took that.

32:53.596 --> 32:55.598
There were nine dollars
in my wallet, Detective,

32:55.598 --> 32:58.559
which I am sure were taken
by those young thieves.

32:58.559 --> 33:01.187
Wanna sign this?

33:05.358 --> 33:07.610
Appreciative as I am,
Detectives,

33:07.610 --> 33:11.781
I do not believe that
any of today's events
refute our article's concerns...

33:11.781 --> 33:14.742
about coercion of suspects
or selective application
of the laws.

33:14.742 --> 33:18.287
-There goes my night's sleep.
-That big vocabulary,
Mr. Highsmith,

33:18.287 --> 33:20.164
there's gotta be
"good-bye" in there.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.293
Quite right.

33:24.293 --> 33:27.630
(chattering)

33:28.715 --> 33:31.801
Uh-oh. I think I feel
another one comin' on.

33:31.801 --> 33:35.638
-(grunting)
-JAMAL: Oh, damn, man!
He bit my finger! Oh, man!

33:35.638 --> 33:38.766
Excuse me, mister,
you got somethin'? Can you
help a brother out? Please!

33:38.766 --> 33:41.686
-Hank, get 'em outta here.
-(laughing)

33:41.686 --> 33:44.105
All right, come on.
Let's go. Come on.

33:44.105 --> 33:47.025
-Move it. Move it.
-(laughing continues)

33:48.359 --> 33:50.361
Mmm.

33:56.117 --> 33:58.578
-Is that on?
-I'm not gonna wear it.

33:58.578 --> 34:01.539
I'm gonna be transmitting
all over the place.

34:01.539 --> 34:03.583
I gonna have them give me
a body recorder.

34:03.583 --> 34:07.420
-What you gotta do, stop
lettin' 'em move you around.
-Yeah, okay.

34:07.420 --> 34:11.674
If this is their game,
Bobby, you're screwed.
You make it so there is no game.

34:11.674 --> 34:17.055
We gotta put stink on
the operation. We have got
to initiate preemptive stink.

34:17.055 --> 34:20.892
-Like how, Andy?
How do we initiate that?
-You collar this asshole.

34:20.892 --> 34:23.686
Big picture in the paper--
You and Salvo at arraignment.

34:23.686 --> 34:27.148
Now you showed you're straight.
You're no use to Salvo,
the bureau, the Rat Squad,

34:27.148 --> 34:29.025
or the job making
you go undercover.

34:29.025 --> 34:31.486
You're useless for nothing
but us goin' back to work.

34:31.486 --> 34:33.821
Andy, if they know
that I'm against them,

34:33.821 --> 34:35.907
anything that I do,
they'll try to turn it around.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.159
How they gonna turn that?
You're putting bracelets
on Salvo.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.995
How? Suppose they put out
that I set up the collar,

34:40.995 --> 34:43.164
and then I ask money for Salvo
to drop the charges?

34:43.164 --> 34:46.334
No, Andy. They gotta think
that I'm cooperating with them.

34:46.334 --> 34:49.337
I worked this prick Salvo
on the Robbery Squad.

34:49.337 --> 34:52.673
-This is a genuine badass.
-Thanks for the tip, Andy.

34:52.673 --> 34:55.718
I watched this guy take out
a kid with a baseball bat
when we were 15.

34:55.718 --> 34:59.305
Citibank stickup--
three guys from his crew--
they showed up dead.

34:59.305 --> 35:02.308
The pie don't need
to get cut up so small.
This is Salvo.

35:02.308 --> 35:04.435
(knocking)
I know it is.

35:07.063 --> 35:09.941
-The shrink's back?
-They got you wearing a Kel?

35:09.941 --> 35:11.943
I'm not wearing a Kel.
I'm gonna wear a Nagra.

35:11.943 --> 35:15.071
Yeah, that's the choices
they left him, what kind
of rat equipment to use.

35:25.873 --> 35:27.208
Sit down.

35:29.710 --> 35:32.004
What a grim environment
to have to work in every day.

35:32.004 --> 35:34.132
Yeah, thanks for
the big concern.

35:35.591 --> 35:39.137
-What developments
with Christine?
-Past being murdered?

35:39.137 --> 35:41.764
It doesn't elude me
you're both taking
provocative tones.

35:41.764 --> 35:43.766
What can you tell us
about treating Christine...

35:43.766 --> 35:47.145
for her emotional problems
about having been raped?

35:47.145 --> 35:51.107
Since the person who attacked
Christine has moved to another
part of the country,

35:51.107 --> 35:54.610
I'd suggest what's
more pertinent to
your homicide investigation...

35:54.610 --> 35:58.030
is the incest issues
with her father--
the rape reexposed--

35:58.030 --> 36:00.283
as I've already brought
to your attention.

36:00.283 --> 36:03.119
You sure wanna put
prison stripes on
this girl's father,

36:03.119 --> 36:05.329
-don't you, Dr. Wentzel?
-My wants have nothing
to do with it.

36:05.329 --> 36:09.292
You wouldn't have had
any "wants" going on with
Christine, would ya, Doc?

36:09.292 --> 36:12.461
Good day.

36:12.461 --> 36:16.382
(huffs)
I'm going to file charges
for what you just did.

36:16.382 --> 36:21.053
-Maybe we'll share a cell.
-What in heaven's name
is going on here?

36:21.053 --> 36:23.389
This girl's father
didn't kill her.

36:23.389 --> 36:25.933
-You think not?
-Yeah, we think not.

36:25.933 --> 36:28.519
And if he didn't, then with
the drain cleaner and such...

36:28.519 --> 36:31.147
getting forced into her
after she's already dead--

36:31.147 --> 36:34.358
everything but
"A Plumber Did This" gettin'
painted on her forehead--

36:34.358 --> 36:37.778
that leads us to think
maybe somebody's framin' him.

36:37.778 --> 36:41.824
And then here comes you,
checking in six and seven
times an hour,

36:41.824 --> 36:44.660
lest we forget
we should be liking this guy
for killing her.

36:44.660 --> 36:49.582
I checked in initially
to inform you of my misgivings,

36:49.582 --> 36:52.376
-and subsequently
at your request.
-RUSSELL: Doctor,

36:52.376 --> 36:55.838
everything we've heard,
this girl and her father
adored each other.

36:55.838 --> 36:59.592
Compounding her sense
of betrayal on recovering
the incest.

36:59.592 --> 37:02.511
You know, I'm--

37:02.511 --> 37:04.639
I'm groveling to
make you understand...

37:04.639 --> 37:08.851
what any competent practitioner
would-would recognize instantly.

37:08.851 --> 37:12.063
-Yeah? Why?
-I'm gonna leave, Detective,

37:12.063 --> 37:14.815
and then neither of us
will have to account
for my behavior.

37:17.777 --> 37:23.032
(mutters)
This is ludicrous.

37:23.032 --> 37:25.993
I'm not even gonna ask
for an attorney. That's
how ludicrous this is.

37:25.993 --> 37:28.246
How did you try
to help Christine, Doc?

37:28.246 --> 37:31.165
Oh, as if you've
any real interest.

37:31.165 --> 37:36.045
This young lady felt
profoundly defiled.

37:36.045 --> 37:39.423
I'll disclose to you that
this young lady was a virgin,

37:39.423 --> 37:42.093
and one felt deep sympathy
for what she experienced.

37:42.093 --> 37:45.221
She had been raised
a certain way.

37:45.221 --> 37:48.808
Very strong family values,
very loving family.

37:48.808 --> 37:50.518
Genuine belief
in the country.

37:52.103 --> 37:55.106
America's promise.
Do you see?

37:56.857 --> 37:59.568
Very touching.

37:59.568 --> 38:02.321
I came from an idealistic
raising myself.

38:02.321 --> 38:05.908
Very loving, affectionate,
deeply moral person.

38:05.908 --> 38:09.662
-This is you?
-Naturally, I--

38:09.662 --> 38:13.207
(sighs)
I was responsive to
Christine's upbringing and--

38:13.207 --> 38:15.584
and her qualities of character.

38:15.584 --> 38:18.796
I'm not a great believer
in coincidence, but...

38:20.256 --> 38:24.552
Miss Lakos came to see me
nine days exactly...

38:24.552 --> 38:26.554
after my mother passed.

38:26.554 --> 38:29.974
And when she was finally
able to discuss it,

38:29.974 --> 38:34.812
the sexual assault
that, uh, she reported
by her fellow worker...

38:34.812 --> 38:38.482
happened to have occurred
two days after
my mother's passing.

38:38.482 --> 38:41.861
-That's some coincidence.
-Oh, you can imagine
one's reaction.

38:44.447 --> 38:48.075
In so many ways...

38:48.075 --> 38:49.827
the age in which
she had to live...

38:49.827 --> 38:53.247
flaunted or made irrelevant.

38:54.165 --> 38:57.084
And in that sense, deeply,

38:57.084 --> 39:02.673
deeply defiled
her values as well,
and sense of herself,

39:02.673 --> 39:05.634
just as Christine
had felt defiled.

39:05.634 --> 39:07.887
RUSSELL:
This is your mom?

39:09.263 --> 39:14.727
Some of that fueled my efforts
to treat Christine.

39:14.727 --> 39:19.732
(voice cracking)
But I obviously was
no good at it,

39:19.732 --> 39:24.320
so the cleansing technique,
so forth--

39:24.320 --> 39:27.365
(bangs)
What are you,
a hundred percent nut job?

39:27.365 --> 39:31.369
-Andy--
-Was this one of your cleansing
techniques, killing this girl?

39:31.369 --> 39:34.121
-My God, you're a sick man.
-I'm a sick man?

39:34.121 --> 39:36.665
What is
a cleansing technique, hmm?

39:36.665 --> 39:39.418
Is it pouring drain cleaner
down her throat?

39:39.418 --> 39:42.713
Or is that a framing technique
after the cleansing technique?

39:42.713 --> 39:45.174
What in heaven's name
is going on here?

39:45.174 --> 39:47.760
It's obvious you're under
a lot of strain, Doctor.

39:47.760 --> 39:51.806
-What in heaven's name
is going on here?
-My guess, sick twitch you are,

39:51.806 --> 39:55.184
this girl reminded you
of Mom's great qualities.

39:55.184 --> 39:59.772
And you wanted to do whatever
"cleansing techniques" got your
chubby going with your old lady.

39:59.772 --> 40:03.651
And when Christine
wouldn't let you,
you croaked her!

40:03.651 --> 40:06.904
-You think you're
a psychiatrist.
-No, I'm a Polack detective...

40:06.904 --> 40:09.156
knows you get away with murder,

40:09.156 --> 40:11.742
you leave the crime scene
and you go about your life.

40:11.742 --> 40:14.453
It's you--
you intelligent types.
You always gotta provide...

40:14.453 --> 40:17.748
an alternate suspect,
like this poor girl's father.

40:17.748 --> 40:20.876
And you lead us by the nose
to their door.

40:20.876 --> 40:25.214
(hits table)
You declined a lawyer
in front of a witness, Doc.

40:25.214 --> 40:28.509
And you ain't leavin' this room
until you give it up.

40:28.509 --> 40:32.012
Now, do you wanna
save yourself some
aches and pains here?

40:38.060 --> 40:41.063
(knocking)
(door opens)

40:41.063 --> 40:44.567
Did he go?

40:44.567 --> 40:47.611
(lock clicks)

40:47.611 --> 40:49.780
You talk about crazy.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.995
They still didn't bring
the Nagra yet?

40:59.707 --> 41:02.209
-Is it on?
-No.

41:10.092 --> 41:13.721
Let you act like a man,
then they try to
turn you into some boy.

41:13.721 --> 41:17.808
-Who said that?
-Some skell.

41:20.644 --> 41:23.647
Oh, man, I feel like
a windup toy.

41:25.191 --> 41:27.234
You'll beat 'em,
Bobby.

41:27.234 --> 41:30.029
You'll play 'em and beat 'em,
and they'll never even know.

41:31.489 --> 41:34.116
Yep.

41:34.116 --> 41:36.368
Now it's just details,
right?

41:40.122 --> 41:42.082
Lock the door
to the squad room.

41:55.012 --> 41:57.848
(siren wailing in distance)

42:04.480 --> 42:07.983
(both moaning)

42:14.281 --> 42:17.034
(moaning continues)

42:20.788 --> 42:23.958
(chattering)

42:23.958 --> 42:26.460
(phone ringing)

42:28.587 --> 42:31.090
-Bobby.
-(moaning continues)

42:57.199 --> 42:59.493
Hey, you got
some hell of a job.

42:59.493 --> 43:03.205
Yep.
(scoffs)

43:03.205 --> 43:06.417
Put your ass on the line
every day, people throwin' shots
at you left and right.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.836
Then your bosses do that.

43:08.836 --> 43:12.381
-Anyways--
-Yeah, anyways, I put you
in that jackpot, Bobby.

43:12.381 --> 43:14.758
Why don't you let me
look out for you now?

43:16.343 --> 43:21.223
Yeah, well, it's not like
I'm buried in job offers,
you know, so--

43:21.223 --> 43:23.767
Oh, you got no job offer.

43:23.767 --> 43:27.062
You got a job,
all right?

43:28.272 --> 43:32.151
All right.
I appreciate that, Joe.

43:32.151 --> 43:36.822
You know, from time to time,
we may "technically"
violate some laws--

43:36.822 --> 43:41.368
(gunshots)

43:44.997 --> 43:47.291
(tires squealing)

43:51.420 --> 43:52.796
-You all right?
-Andy.

43:52.796 --> 43:54.632
-Get outta here!
-What happened?

43:54.632 --> 43:57.760
I made a left on Mulberry
and this is what I saw.

43:57.760 --> 44:00.012
What did you do?

44:00.012 --> 44:01.889
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

44:01.889 --> 44:03.932
-They got no game now.
Get out!
-Andy, what did you do?

44:03.932 --> 44:05.476
-I'll tell 'em what I saw.
-You get outta here!

44:05.476 --> 44:08.187
I know what I did.
(siren wailing)

44:08.187 --> 44:10.022
-They're comin'.
Will you get outta here?
-Andy, get outta here!

44:10.022 --> 44:12.858
You better lose that tape.

44:15.653 --> 44:18.322
(siren continues)

44:34.421 --> 44:36.882
(siren stops)

44:38.634 --> 44:40.469
Don't move.

44:51.313 --> 44:54.316
