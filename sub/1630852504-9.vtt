WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:02.367
- Come on, you knew I found
randy bowen's body,

00:02.370 --> 00:03.435
You didn't think to
hand over the file to me?

00:03.471 --> 00:05.070
- Nope. I didn't.

00:06.741 --> 00:09.241
(davidson): Snitch.
(mcconnell): Ooh-ah!

00:09.844 --> 00:11.076
- There you go.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.045
(sam): Elliot, you got a job?

00:13.180 --> 00:14.480
That's so good! Where?

00:14.615 --> 00:15.713
(elliot): Uh...

00:15.750 --> 00:18.049
Y-you know, I-I'll tell you
about it later, mom.

00:18.085 --> 00:20.452
I gotta go. But...
I love you, okay?

00:20.587 --> 00:23.054
- You know, when my mom
does this mdma deal,

00:23.090 --> 00:24.790
She can get buffalo off her back

00:24.792 --> 00:26.991
And then, we can
get out of this, start fresh,

00:27.028 --> 00:28.259
Get our cut.

00:28.395 --> 00:30.462
- A shipment of flowers is
slated to go to buffalo today.

00:30.597 --> 00:33.632
Question is: Are they delivering
drugs hidden in flowers

00:33.634 --> 00:34.899
Or are they just
delivering flowers?

00:34.935 --> 00:37.035
- Where did you say your son
got a job?

00:37.071 --> 00:39.104
- I don't know.
He didn't say. Why?

00:39.173 --> 00:41.306
If you have gotten yourself
into something

00:41.342 --> 00:42.407
That you can't get out of,

00:42.476 --> 00:43.609
I can get you out.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.544
- How do you know about
bill misiano?

00:45.613 --> 00:46.678
(lam): I didn't.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.280
Until he reached out to me.

00:48.349 --> 00:51.416
Misiano wants to
work with me... Direct.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.219
I'm thinking the less people
involved, the better.

00:54.354 --> 00:55.620
(misiano): I'm a snake.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.289
It's a fact.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.823
Everybody know that about me.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.893
- Tiggy sullivan.
- Tiggy sullivan.

01:06.801 --> 01:09.634
(water rushes)

01:09.670 --> 01:10.769
(laughter)

01:10.838 --> 01:12.437
- Come on in!

01:12.506 --> 01:16.108
Welcome, tiggy!
- Wow!

01:16.177 --> 01:18.911
- Welcome to my-my pad.

01:19.046 --> 01:22.714
Uh... Oh, yeah,
we should take our shoes off.

01:22.750 --> 01:23.681
Here.

01:24.651 --> 01:26.251
Yeah, this'll keep
your feet warm.

01:28.188 --> 01:29.188
(tiggy): Thanks.

01:29.323 --> 01:32.324
- My, uh, my aunt carmel,
she knit those.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.593
We used to call 'em gliders.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.595
- I really should go
check into a hotel.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.429
- My spare room's better
than any hotel,

01:38.466 --> 01:39.998
I'll tell you that right now.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.599
Come on, put 'em on.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.903
Oh, yeah.
Boot helpage.

01:45.038 --> 01:46.404
One.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.072
And... Two.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.479
(soft chuckle)

01:54.482 --> 01:55.346
(softly): Wow.

01:56.650 --> 01:57.448
(soft gasp)

01:58.552 --> 02:00.953
Whoa. Niagara falls.
- Right?

02:03.958 --> 02:06.625
(misiano): You know,
back in the day,

02:06.627 --> 02:08.227
Before I rejected misogyny,

02:08.229 --> 02:10.229
I used to compare my view
of the falls with

02:10.364 --> 02:12.431
A really nice pair of tits.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.933
I mean, you know, someone else
gets to own 'em,

02:14.969 --> 02:16.634
But I still get to look at 'em.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.170
Never say that now.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.038
No, no, no.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.041
Cup of tea?

02:24.277 --> 02:25.944
(misiano): Sugar, sugar, sugar.
Ah, here it is.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.580
Hey, tiggy, hey, tiggy!

02:28.582 --> 02:31.683
Hey, reviews!
They're coming in.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.018
On the mdma.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.053
Everybody says it's a knockout.

02:35.089 --> 02:36.722
Like, knockout.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.457
So, I want to take it up
a notch.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.258
I'm thinking of getting
way more of that stuff.

02:40.294 --> 02:44.729
You think you could find me
a couple of trustworthy drivers?

02:44.798 --> 02:46.131
- I could get my sister
to do it.

02:46.266 --> 02:47.266
- Oh, no. No family.

02:47.268 --> 02:49.534
No family. We need you
once removed.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.670
But you're on the
right track, tiggy.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.238
I love women drivers.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.806
- Okay. Well...

02:54.808 --> 02:56.007
Let me think about it.

02:56.076 --> 02:58.477
I'm sure I've got... Some women
in my world that I trust.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.078
- I want you to tell me
everything you know

03:00.114 --> 03:01.412
About this nelson fella.

03:01.448 --> 03:03.415
- The guy who makes
the mdma?

03:03.484 --> 03:04.549
You know more than I do.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.284
You're the one who got in direct
contact with him

03:06.420 --> 03:08.020
And tried to squeeze me out,
remember?

03:08.155 --> 03:08.953
- Nah, not really.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.022
I'm-I'm thinking

03:10.157 --> 03:12.424
I'm gonna go up and see
his warehouse soon.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.626
I was thinking maybe
you and me...

03:14.662 --> 03:15.694
Could go together.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.829
Go check out and see
how he makes this stuff.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.098
And then, we pop him.

03:22.102 --> 03:23.635
- Pop him?

03:23.671 --> 03:25.237
- Pop him. Take him out.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.305
Drop him.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.772
Take sugar?

03:27.808 --> 03:29.608
(misiano): There you go.
- I'm sorry, bill, I-

03:29.677 --> 03:32.243
I'm not in the killing business.

03:32.279 --> 03:33.712
- Hey.

03:33.781 --> 03:34.979
Tiggy.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.448
You're in the drug business,

03:36.450 --> 03:38.916
Which means you're in the
killing business.

03:38.953 --> 03:41.520
Believe me, I didn't like it
either at first.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.722
Which is why you gotta
find something in it

03:43.857 --> 03:45.189
That you do like.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.991
Something that can
warm your heart.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.660
In my case,

03:48.696 --> 03:51.863
I found that most boys
that I popped carried lighters.

03:51.998 --> 03:53.965
And I started collecting them.

03:53.968 --> 03:55.267
And when they didn't
carry lighters,

03:55.269 --> 03:57.535
Some of them carried
pocket watches.

03:57.537 --> 03:59.071
So I started collecting
those too.

03:59.073 --> 04:02.474
Now, I'm full in
and relaxed. It's nice.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.276
I look forward to going through
their pockets.

04:04.278 --> 04:06.278
It's-it's like winning a prize
at the fair,

04:06.413 --> 04:07.645
You know what I mean?

04:09.750 --> 04:10.682
- So...

04:10.684 --> 04:12.484
All of these...

04:13.487 --> 04:14.553
They're all from people
you killed?

04:14.688 --> 04:16.355
(laughing)

04:16.490 --> 04:17.622
- God no!

04:17.625 --> 04:19.491
Nah, nah. Like, uh...

04:19.626 --> 04:22.094
This one here,
bought it online.

04:22.229 --> 04:25.897
This one here,
poolside in orlando.

04:25.933 --> 04:29.434
That one came out of
a piñata, and so on.

04:29.470 --> 04:33.038
The key is, you don't want to
think that you're a killer.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.439
You want to think that
you're a winner,

04:34.508 --> 04:36.108
Like you're a survivor.

04:36.243 --> 04:39.010
You don't want to be known
as a killer,

04:39.046 --> 04:40.312
But equally,

04:40.381 --> 04:42.781
Nobody wants to get labelled
a loser.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.116
Just to say, like, I mean,
you and I got in a fight

04:45.152 --> 04:45.917
And I killed you.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.319
Who's the winner,
who's the loser?

04:47.454 --> 04:48.419
D-do you see what I mean?

04:49.957 --> 04:51.089
- I think so?

04:51.224 --> 04:53.191
- What's it gonna be, tiggy?

04:54.628 --> 04:55.794
What's it gonna be?

04:55.929 --> 04:57.228
You gonna go all the way
with me

04:57.264 --> 04:59.931
Or-or what? I say
we cut nelson out

04:59.933 --> 05:02.334
And we take it all
ourselves.

05:03.737 --> 05:04.670
- Why the hell not.

05:05.539 --> 05:06.671
- Why the hell not.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.807
You finish your tea.

05:08.876 --> 05:11.476
I'm gonna go put some
fresh sheets on your bed

05:11.512 --> 05:15.213
And put some chocolates
on your pillow, and then,

05:15.249 --> 05:17.949
I'm gonna read you some
sexist passages from the bible

05:18.018 --> 05:19.450
That boil my piss.

05:21.421 --> 05:22.954
That's good. Drink up.
Come on.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.089
I've been dying to get

05:24.224 --> 05:26.425
A woman's perspective
on this stuff, you know?

05:26.427 --> 05:27.692
I'm so excited!

05:27.695 --> 05:29.894
<i> ♪ I'm a magic man ♪</i>

05:30.831 --> 05:32.431
<i> ♪ yeah yeah ♪</i>

05:32.566 --> 05:35.500
<i> ♪ I'm a magic man, yeah ♪</i>

05:36.770 --> 05:38.437
- Tiggy sullivan,
42 years old,

05:38.572 --> 05:40.439
Full name, antigone
susan sullivan.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.774
- Wow, her parents did not
consider her initials

05:42.810 --> 05:43.975
When they named her, huh?

05:44.011 --> 05:45.644
- Probably why she turned
to a life of crime.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.780
- Yeah, now our ass is literally
in the wind.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.782
- Okay, okay. Here's our
working theory:

05:50.818 --> 05:53.184
Rick gets busted,
tiggy takes over from rick

05:53.319 --> 05:55.186
Starts bringing in misiano's
cocaine across the border

05:55.222 --> 05:56.388
Using her logistics company.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.789
Starts working with
randy bowen

05:57.924 --> 06:00.725
Importing the cocaine and
exporting the mdma.

06:00.728 --> 06:01.859
- How'd we miss this?

06:01.895 --> 06:03.928
She's your confidential
informant's mother.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.231
She was literally under our nose
the entire time.

06:06.300 --> 06:07.465
- We checked her company.

06:07.501 --> 06:08.333
It was clean.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.135
She had no record.
(sam): It was me.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.602
The whole...

06:11.638 --> 06:13.471
Single mother struggling,
I just...

06:13.507 --> 06:15.073
I bought into the whole thing.
- But...

06:15.208 --> 06:17.608
The good news is
she got greedy.

06:17.644 --> 06:20.178
Her little expansion to the
mdma business led us

06:20.214 --> 06:22.213
To gaia flowers, which,
in turn,

06:22.249 --> 06:25.650
Led us to the mdma shipment
that she took across the border.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.251
(shanks): So, where is she now?

06:27.287 --> 06:28.820
- She hasn't crossed back over
into canada yet,

06:28.889 --> 06:30.221
But we have border patrol
on it.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.423
(sam): Yeah, and hamm's outside
her residence.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.157
Gonna search the place
as soon as we get the warrant.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.559
- We got enough for a warrant?

06:34.694 --> 06:35.861
(nathan): Given the nature of
tiggy's job,

06:35.863 --> 06:39.164
And her... Association
with randy bowen,

06:39.233 --> 06:40.031
Should be enough.

06:40.166 --> 06:41.400
I think we're good.

06:41.535 --> 06:42.834
- Okay. Keep me posted.

06:42.969 --> 06:45.403
One last question: What happened
to your face?

06:46.440 --> 06:49.774
- Uh, it's a... It's
a volleyball injury.

06:49.810 --> 06:50.976
- Oh my god, I totally get it.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.277
All through high school, like,
every team sport,

06:53.313 --> 06:55.046
It's like, constant balls in
my face, like

06:55.115 --> 06:57.182
Bang, bang, bang-bang,
bang-bang-bang,

06:57.251 --> 06:59.183
Slap-slap-slap, slap.
Ugh.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.754
- And that, constable,

07:02.756 --> 07:05.590
Is how I found out that
I have a latex allergy.

07:05.626 --> 07:08.126
- Wow. That's a-that's
a riveting story.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.662
- You know that you could kill
me with that avocado right now?

07:10.797 --> 07:11.796
- Well, I...
- Chemically,

07:11.865 --> 07:13.598
They're very similar.
- Okay, do you want me to

07:13.600 --> 07:15.333
Throw out the avocado?

07:15.335 --> 07:17.369
- The whole sandwich, actually.
(soft gasp)

07:17.371 --> 07:18.737
Just to be safe!

07:18.872 --> 07:21.406
An ounce of prevention is worth
a pound of cure.

07:21.541 --> 07:24.008
- You have to see a new doctor,
hamm.

07:25.946 --> 07:26.811
(car door closes)

07:31.485 --> 07:32.584
(muffled): Are you happy?

07:32.586 --> 07:34.152
(hamm speaks indistinctly)
(muffled): Okay!

07:37.624 --> 07:38.556
(tiggy):<i> Hey.</i>

07:38.625 --> 07:40.024
- Hey, the cops are sitting on
our place.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.459
(misiano):<i> Tiggy!</i>
<i> It's like audre lorde...</i>

07:41.462 --> 07:43.361
- What? Are you sure?
(layna):<i> Yeah.</i>

07:43.430 --> 07:45.897
There's two of them, parked
outside for hours,

07:45.933 --> 07:47.566
Watching the house.
What should I do?

07:47.568 --> 07:48.900
(misiano chatters continuously)

07:48.936 --> 07:50.969
- Defrost dinner and leave.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.103
- What?

07:52.105 --> 07:54.673
(tiggy):<i> "defrost dinner"</i>
<i> and leave.</i>

07:54.675 --> 07:55.773
(softly): Okay.

07:55.909 --> 07:56.741
(tiggy):<i> The freezer.</i>

07:56.877 --> 07:58.743
- Okay, yes, I'm doing it!

08:02.783 --> 08:04.316
Why am I looking through
the f--

08:13.260 --> 08:14.125
Where should I go?

08:14.261 --> 08:15.793
- Go to square one.

08:17.431 --> 08:18.596
- You mean the mall?

08:18.632 --> 08:21.366
- No, layna, square one.

08:21.368 --> 08:22.934
- I don't know what
you're saying.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.002
<i> Can't I just stay put?</i>

08:24.137 --> 08:25.537
<i> I mean, there's nothing</i>
<i> to see here, right?</i>

08:26.773 --> 08:28.740
- Especially if they're looking
between your ears.

08:29.776 --> 08:31.009
<i> Listen to me.</i>

08:31.011 --> 08:33.445
Send sol to school with
his lunch packed.

08:33.447 --> 08:34.879
<i> I'll call you when I can.</i>

08:34.915 --> 08:36.147
<i> Answer when I call.</i>

08:36.149 --> 08:38.416
- And if I don't,
you'll know the cops got me.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.153
- Leaving so soon?
Everything okay?

08:42.289 --> 08:44.489
- Oh, yeah, uh,
just kid stuff.

08:44.491 --> 08:45.690
I should get going.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.893
Hey, thanks for letting me
crash.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.895
- Drive safe, ladybug.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.431
We're gonna be visiting that
warehouse the next few days.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.432
- Sure.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.234
I'll call nelson
and set that up.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.874
- Okay, defrost dinner.
Defrost dinner.

09:03.009 --> 09:04.842
Send sol to school.
Pack his lunch.

09:04.912 --> 09:05.777
Defrost dinner.

09:05.846 --> 09:06.978
Go pack his--

09:08.048 --> 09:08.847
Okay.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.461
You ready to go, baby?

09:28.602 --> 09:30.602
- Yo, you drive,
I'll dj.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.271
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.606
- Hey, elliot!
Where you headed?

09:35.642 --> 09:37.475
- Going out with my friend.

09:37.477 --> 09:38.943
(steve): Okay, rad.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.211
'cause your mother called,

09:40.280 --> 09:42.013
Wanted me to make sure that
you weren't...

09:42.148 --> 09:44.282
Working with that...
Courier crowd.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.483
- That job's not a thing
anymore.

09:45.552 --> 09:46.551
- Cool.

09:46.686 --> 09:48.486
- Which is why I could actually
use 20 bucks.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.021
- Gotcha.
(elliot): Nice.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.423
- She also told me to make sure
you weren't...

09:52.459 --> 09:53.825
Hanging around with that...

09:53.894 --> 09:55.426
Jackie sullivan.

09:55.462 --> 09:56.427
- Who's jackie?

09:57.297 --> 09:58.897
- Uh, she's my ex-girlfriend.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.298
She's nothing but trouble.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.366
- Huh.

10:02.502 --> 10:03.902
(jackie): I'm penelope,
by the way.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.470
I'm just studying photography
at ocad.

10:05.539 --> 10:07.772
Elliot was really nice to offer
to model for me.

10:07.907 --> 10:09.607
Which is super... Nice.
- Oh.

10:09.742 --> 10:10.709
(jackie): Super sweet,
super helpful.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.110
He's actually kinda shy
about it,

10:12.245 --> 10:14.579
He's, uh, agreed to...
Pose nude.

10:14.648 --> 10:15.713
- Oh.
(she laughs)

10:15.749 --> 10:17.148
- Nude?
- Yeah!

10:17.150 --> 10:18.282
- Okay. Cool.
(elliot): Uh...

10:18.318 --> 10:19.384
- Experimental piece.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.053
- Have fun, my dude.
- Alright.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.321
- Nice to meet you!

10:28.095 --> 10:29.127
Bodhi just texted,

10:29.262 --> 10:30.862
He said that they're moving
the entire operation

10:30.931 --> 10:32.697
Into that warehouse
on sterling.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.533
♪♪

10:42.042 --> 10:44.342
(kelly inhales
and exhales deeply)

10:46.213 --> 10:49.347
- Well, well, well, if it
isn't the dream team.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.116
- Hey.

10:51.118 --> 10:54.618
Uh, you realize you're parked
under a no-parking sign, right?

10:57.257 --> 10:58.957
(scoffs): Yeah!

10:58.959 --> 11:01.626
It's all a part of my strategy
so no one makes us as cops.

11:01.761 --> 11:04.261
(sam): Right. And you know
you're dressed as...

11:05.999 --> 11:07.699
...Cops.
- Yeah.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.901
(kelly): Yeah, okay. Let's go.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.637
- Could you please try
and be cool? Be cool!

11:15.441 --> 11:16.441
(door opening)

11:16.443 --> 11:18.309
(kelly): Oh! Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.181
I don't want to do this
in front of that kid.

11:28.555 --> 11:29.787
Alright, let's go.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.392
- Oh, crap!

11:35.529 --> 11:36.994
(layna): Oh, crap, crap!

11:38.798 --> 11:40.398
Crap, crap!

11:41.801 --> 11:43.000
Sorry, mercedes!

11:43.036 --> 11:44.536
(banging on door)
(sam): Police, open up!

11:44.538 --> 11:46.404
We have a warrant
for your arrest!

11:48.775 --> 11:51.876
- Gtpd! We have a warrant
to search the premises!

11:52.011 --> 11:53.111
(door slaming)

11:53.180 --> 11:54.579
(sam): Go. Go, go, go, go, go!

11:57.884 --> 11:59.284
- Gotcha!
(layna yells)

11:59.286 --> 12:00.952
(hamm screams shrilly)

12:01.087 --> 12:02.520
- Sorry, mercedes!

12:02.522 --> 12:03.955
(breann): Stop, police!
(layna gasps)

12:04.024 --> 12:05.656
(kelly): Layna sullivan!

12:05.692 --> 12:06.891
You're under arrest!
- For what?

12:07.026 --> 12:09.227
- For throwing your snake at
a police officer, that's what.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.561
It's assault with a deadly
weapon.

12:10.597 --> 12:12.697
- She's not deadly!
- Still assault. Turn around!

12:12.766 --> 12:14.032
Put your hands on your head,
please.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.766
- You're screaming
like a banshee.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.969
She's so cute!
- That was not a scream, okay?

12:18.038 --> 12:19.570
(hamm): That was a loud noise
of surprise.

12:19.606 --> 12:20.972
(kelly): How is that not
a scream?

12:20.974 --> 12:22.439
- This isn't funny, okay?
This is not funny.

12:22.476 --> 12:25.643
- Really? 'cause I find it
hy-sss-terical.

12:25.645 --> 12:26.911
(she laughs snarkily)

12:26.947 --> 12:29.647
Like, "sss", like I was
a snake there, f-- it's good.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.516
- Can't believe you're
afraid of this.

12:31.585 --> 12:32.984
Hi!

12:33.053 --> 12:37.188
(babying): Yes!
Yes, he's a bad, bad boy.

12:41.027 --> 12:42.960
(sam): Okay, layna,
where's tiggy?

12:43.997 --> 12:45.596
- I plead the fifth.

12:45.632 --> 12:48.099
- This is canada.
That's not a thing.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.568
- Well, I refuse to answer
and you can't hold me.

12:50.703 --> 12:51.602
(soft knock on mirror)

12:53.273 --> 12:54.471
(kelly sighs)

12:59.312 --> 13:00.779
(shanks): We ran layna's prints.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.680
Turns out that snake
isn't the only thing

13:02.716 --> 13:03.915
She had her hands
all over.

13:05.418 --> 13:06.484
- Randy's motel.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.686
- Uh-huh. They were the only
clear set of prints

13:08.822 --> 13:10.889
We were able to get
besides randy's.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.424
I'm gonna have to hand
this over to homicide.

13:13.426 --> 13:14.492
- No!
(kelly): Yes!

13:14.627 --> 13:16.694
At least let us finish
our interview.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.397
- Okay, but you got the
20 minutes it's gonna take

13:19.466 --> 13:21.098
For tweedledee and tweedledum
to get down here.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.300
- Yep.
(door buzzes open)

13:26.840 --> 13:28.106
(kelly): I believe you know
this man.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.908
- Why would you show those
to me?!

13:30.043 --> 13:31.442
- You need to look at it.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.245
He's dead!

13:35.448 --> 13:36.648
(sam): And your fingerprints
were found

13:36.783 --> 13:39.250
All over the hotel room
where randy bowen was shot.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.519
In the mini bar, the windows,
the bedroom.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.520
- So?
(kelly): So you just became

13:43.557 --> 13:46.257
A person of interest in
a murder investigation.

13:48.829 --> 13:49.793
- No, no, hold up.

13:49.830 --> 13:50.728
I didn't kill randy.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.597
And my prints are
all over that room

13:52.666 --> 13:55.166
Because I was<i> with</i> randy
all over that room.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.868
The only thing I'm guilty of

13:57.003 --> 13:59.937
Is having great sex
with a bad man.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.747
Maybe I'm also guilty of
being stupid.

14:09.816 --> 14:11.282
I mean, that's what
tiggy thinks.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.150
It's like, I'm so afraid...

14:13.152 --> 14:15.086
That she'll think I'm stupid.
I end up being stupider.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.487
Today, she's speaking to me
in code.

14:16.622 --> 14:18.456
I didn't have a clue
what she was talking about.

14:18.525 --> 14:22.360
So, I can't even tell you
where she wants me to meet her.

14:22.495 --> 14:23.727
- You spoke to tiggy today.

14:23.763 --> 14:24.862
- What sort of code?

14:24.997 --> 14:26.698
(kelly): Sounds like you
gave her the heads up

14:26.700 --> 14:28.299
About the cops
being outside

14:28.335 --> 14:30.435
And she was coming up with
a plan on where to meet.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.835
Uh-huh.

14:31.872 --> 14:34.505
Were jackie and sol
supposed to meet her too?

14:34.574 --> 14:36.040
- Where is jackie anyway?

14:36.076 --> 14:37.709
(sam): She's got a new phone,

14:37.844 --> 14:39.243
New number.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.645
Do you have it?

14:42.582 --> 14:44.281
- I'm pleading the equivalent
to the fifth?

14:48.755 --> 14:50.054
(door buzzes)

14:51.324 --> 14:52.523
(kelly):<i> Listen, ms. Sullivan,</i>

14:52.592 --> 14:53.858
<i> I don't think you're</i>
<i> a bad person</i>

14:53.860 --> 14:55.927
<i> I think you just got caught up</i>
<i> in your sister's mess.</i>

14:55.929 --> 14:57.528
(cell phone vibrating)

15:05.071 --> 15:06.004
- Hey.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.605
(sam):<i> Hey, elliot,</i>
<i> where are you?</i>

15:07.740 --> 15:10.742
- I-I'm just... Out skating
with henry.

15:10.877 --> 15:11.742
(sam):<i> Okay, are you</i>
<i> with jackie?</i>

15:11.877 --> 15:12.844
It's important.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.345
If you are,
just-just say panzerotti.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.346
- Mom, no.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.814
(sam):<i> Okay, do you know</i>
<i> where she is?</i>

15:16.850 --> 15:19.150
- She's... I don't know,
she-she went to see her dad.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.285
- Really? Okay, where?

15:21.288 --> 15:22.286
- I don't know.
I-I-I...

15:22.289 --> 15:23.954
We're not... Talking
anymore, so...

15:23.990 --> 15:25.222
- Alright.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.424
(layna):<i> ...The snake probably</i>
<i> knows more than I do.</i>

15:26.559 --> 15:28.159
- Elliot, wait, j-just...

15:28.161 --> 15:30.161
<i> Are you telling me the truth?</i>

15:30.163 --> 15:31.896
- Yeah. I-I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later.

15:32.031 --> 15:32.963
Okay, bye.

15:34.901 --> 15:36.534
(jackie): Hey, so, if we're not
selling on the street anymore,

15:36.669 --> 15:37.902
What are we doing?
How're we getting paid?

15:38.037 --> 15:39.570
(bodhi): Well, I don't know if
you've noticed,

15:39.706 --> 15:41.873
But the cops shut our
courier business down.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.975
We're keeping a low profile.

15:45.011 --> 15:47.978
And only selling to buffalo
for now.

15:48.014 --> 15:50.715
So, if you want your money...

15:50.850 --> 15:51.649
Get to work.

15:53.319 --> 15:54.252
They're cooking over there.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.720
These guys are crushing.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.856
You two... Can finish the caps.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.925
- So this is how they make
molly, huh?

16:00.927 --> 16:03.461
(bodhi): Cook. Crush.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.196
Capsule.

16:06.666 --> 16:07.564
That's it.

16:08.768 --> 16:09.734
Grab a seat.

16:14.340 --> 16:16.673
<i>(sam): Okay, I've tried elliot,</i>
<i> I've tried jackie,</i>

16:16.710 --> 16:18.476
Border security
hasn't seen tiggy.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.078
I've pinged her phone,
there is no signal.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.279
Hello! What are you doing?

16:21.414 --> 16:22.413
That is my granola.

16:22.548 --> 16:24.349
Please don't.
- There's no granola.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.350
- My name's on it. So...
- Hm.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.686
Finders, keepers.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.021
Look, if she's still in the us,

16:30.156 --> 16:31.823
We don't have jurisdiction
to trace it.

16:31.958 --> 16:32.957
- Well...

16:33.026 --> 16:35.026
Do we have any connections
in buffalo

16:35.028 --> 16:36.693
Who might pull a favour
for us?

16:38.231 --> 16:39.497
- I know someone.

16:39.566 --> 16:40.565
But...

16:40.700 --> 16:42.567
I'm gonna have to eat
a lot of crow to do this.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.368
- That's better than
eating my granola.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.836
Can I have that back, please?

16:45.872 --> 16:48.506
Honestly, I use it
as topping only.

16:48.641 --> 16:49.974
- On what?

16:50.109 --> 16:51.575
- Other cereal.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.244
(kelly): Ugh.

16:53.379 --> 16:54.445
- Uh-huh, it's very good.

16:54.580 --> 16:55.345
(kelly scoffs)

16:59.986 --> 17:00.985
(ringing on the line)

17:01.054 --> 17:02.320
(officer):<i> Buffalo rp.</i>

17:02.322 --> 17:04.522
- Hello, may I please speak
to detective karina duff?

17:04.657 --> 17:05.623
(officer):<i> Uh-huh. Hold please.</i>

17:05.758 --> 17:06.757
- Thank you.

17:06.760 --> 17:07.925
- Are you kidding me?

17:07.927 --> 17:09.627
Is that a cousin?
Ooh, was that your mother?

17:09.696 --> 17:10.595
(gasping): Is it a sister?

17:10.730 --> 17:11.729
Please, is it a sister?
(kelly shushing)

17:11.798 --> 17:12.663
Is it, please!

17:12.665 --> 17:14.599
(snaps fingers)
- no questions.

17:14.601 --> 17:15.867
(muzak on the line)

17:17.003 --> 17:18.936
(karina):<i> This is</i>
<i> detective duff.</i>

17:18.938 --> 17:20.671
- Karina, it's me.

17:21.574 --> 17:22.740
(karina):<i> Wow.</i>

17:22.875 --> 17:26.310
<i> Either hell has frozen over</i>
<i> or you want something.</i>

17:26.346 --> 17:29.880
- The latter. And I wouldn't be
asking unless it was important.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.282
<i> - Of course, you wouldn't.</i>

17:31.284 --> 17:33.918
<i> Because you are a lone wolf</i>
<i> who doesn't need anyone,</i>

17:33.920 --> 17:35.619
<i> Including your own sister.</i>

17:35.688 --> 17:38.288
- Well. I need you now. Okay?

17:38.324 --> 17:40.258
I was wondering if you could
ping a phone

17:40.260 --> 17:42.627
To see if a suspect
is in your area.

17:42.762 --> 17:46.030
<i> - And this is of interest</i>
<i> to the buffalo rp why?</i>

17:46.099 --> 17:48.165
- Uh... Never said it was.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.767
It's of interest to me.

17:50.904 --> 17:51.903
(karina sighing)

17:51.905 --> 17:53.237
<i> - Send me over</i>
<i> the contact info,</i>

17:53.306 --> 17:54.839
<i> I'll see what I can do.</i>

17:58.078 --> 17:59.176
- Yeah, you happy?

18:00.547 --> 18:02.513
Ooh. Look at your face.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.916
This must be like christmas
for you, huh?

18:05.051 --> 18:06.550
You barely can contain
yourself,

18:06.619 --> 18:09.220
Just bursting with a
billion questions, am I right?

18:09.222 --> 18:11.055
(sam): I have way bigger things
on my mind,

18:11.190 --> 18:12.389
Important matters

18:12.425 --> 18:14.258
Other than your incredibly
intriguing family drama,

18:14.327 --> 18:15.126
Thank you very much.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.594
- Okay. So go do them, then.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.496
- I have one question.
- Nope.

18:18.631 --> 18:19.463
(sam exhales, disappointed)

18:25.404 --> 18:26.604
- Come on, layna.
(ringing on line)

18:26.739 --> 18:27.704
Pick up, pick up!

18:29.909 --> 18:32.343
(layna's voice):<i> This is layna,</i>
<i> you know what to do!</i>

18:32.478 --> 18:33.577
- Kidding me!

18:45.424 --> 18:46.824
(ringing on line)

18:46.959 --> 18:48.292
(cell phone ringing)

18:50.563 --> 18:51.762
- Tsk!

18:51.831 --> 18:52.830
(sighing)

18:52.965 --> 18:54.098
(tiggy):<i> Maureen, hi!</i>

18:54.100 --> 18:55.098
- What's preventing you

18:55.135 --> 18:57.234
From taking care of your
own child this time?

18:58.705 --> 19:00.771
- I'm-I'm held up with some
work stuff.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.573
<i> Could you please call</i>
<i> the school,</i>

19:02.642 --> 19:04.441
<i> Tell sol to go home with you</i>
<i> when he gets out?</i>

19:04.443 --> 19:08.445
- Well, I'm drawing
the line here, tig.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.581
You don't show up by six,

19:10.617 --> 19:12.316
I'm gonna get sol's things

19:12.318 --> 19:13.985
<i> And he's gonna move here</i>
<i> permanently.</i>

19:14.120 --> 19:15.920
<i> Am I clear?</i>

19:15.922 --> 19:19.190
(angrily): I'll be there,
maureen. Relax.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.592
- Yeah... Right.

19:26.399 --> 19:27.932
- Is it hard having siblings?

19:27.934 --> 19:29.133
'cause I was thinking about it,

19:29.268 --> 19:31.469
And I just think that it really,
it really, really would be.

19:31.604 --> 19:32.937
If you ever need to vent,

19:33.006 --> 19:35.005
If you need to talk to someone,
I'm a very good listener.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.873
- Yeah? Because you really
weren't listening

19:36.910 --> 19:38.476
When I asked you
not to ask.

19:38.478 --> 19:39.677
- That's because that was
an "obey" listen,

19:39.812 --> 19:41.812
What I'm talking about is more
"lend an ear" listen.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.816
(kelly): Okay. Check this out.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.752
So, the last time sullivan
logistics crossed back

19:47.754 --> 19:52.423
Into canada, this guy...
Kenneth barbey was working.

19:52.425 --> 19:53.491
(silent laughter)

19:53.493 --> 19:56.360
(sam): Oh my g--
duff, did you h-- ken barbey!

19:56.362 --> 19:57.962
(sam laughs)
- look at this.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.696
- Can you ima--
- he was also working

19:59.732 --> 20:02.299
The last three times
layna returned from buffalo.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.834
Oh-ho!
- Okay, okay!

20:03.836 --> 20:04.835
Guess what I'm thinking?

20:04.837 --> 20:06.170
Maybe he's their route.

20:06.172 --> 20:07.904
You know, le-let's them in
without inspection.

20:07.941 --> 20:09.974
- Our guy's working this
afternoon.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.442
(cell phone chiming)

20:14.514 --> 20:16.179
Uh, karina, what's up?

20:16.216 --> 20:18.115
(karina):<i> Tiggy sullivan's</i>
<i> cell phone just pinged</i>

20:18.251 --> 20:20.184
<i> About two miles south</i>
<i> of the fort derby border.</i>

20:21.888 --> 20:24.121
- Thanks. I appreciate it.

20:24.157 --> 20:25.523
(karina):<i> You want to tell me</i>
<i> what this is about?</i>

20:25.658 --> 20:26.924
- No. Talk to you later!

20:26.926 --> 20:28.959
(she chuckles)
- okay.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.128
Is that your idea of
eating crow?

20:31.197 --> 20:32.597
Because I-I'm thinking that

20:32.732 --> 20:35.399
Maybe you misunderstand the term
"eating crow".

20:35.534 --> 20:37.034
- No, I don't. But how about

20:37.070 --> 20:39.203
I get some drive-through crow
on our way to the us border?

20:39.205 --> 20:41.538
Our guy starts his shift
in a couple hours,

20:41.674 --> 20:43.107
Just enough time for us
to get there.

20:43.176 --> 20:44.208
(sam): Yes!

20:46.679 --> 20:48.145
(kelly): Let's go, let's go!

20:48.181 --> 20:49.212
- I'm going.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.081
(kelly): Forget the pens,
let's go! Let's go!

20:51.216 --> 20:52.483
I'm leaving you!

20:52.552 --> 20:54.151
(sam): I'm going so fast!

21:06.165 --> 21:07.698
- The next shift starts in
15 minutes.

21:07.833 --> 21:09.166
- Hey, hey, wait.

21:09.202 --> 21:11.101
Check it out.
You think that's him?

21:12.305 --> 21:14.872
I think that fanny pack costs
more than my house.

21:14.874 --> 21:15.873
- Wow.

21:16.008 --> 21:17.642
(sam): Is that
a reflective coat?

21:17.777 --> 21:19.510
(kelly): Oh, wait. He has to be
wheeled to work.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.844
He can't walk.
- Yeah. He can't just walk

21:20.913 --> 21:22.479
The 10 steps.
- Hm.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.586
He's making his coin somehow.
- Yep.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.122
Let's wait till he gets inside

21:31.257 --> 21:32.123
So he has nowhere to...

21:32.258 --> 21:34.792
Uh, ru-- like, scoot.
- Yeah.

21:39.198 --> 21:40.331
(woman): Kenneth barbey?

21:40.333 --> 21:42.466
I'm detective karina duff,
buffalo rp,

21:42.502 --> 21:43.934
I need to ask you
a few questions.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.302
- Detective kelly duff,

21:45.371 --> 21:47.204
Ken barbey,
greater toronto police.

21:47.206 --> 21:50.607
I'm sorry. First, we need to
ask you a few questions.

21:50.677 --> 21:51.742
- What's this about?

21:52.612 --> 21:54.278
- Are you pilfering my case now?

21:54.280 --> 21:55.746
- After you pilfered
my connections.

21:55.881 --> 21:56.881
And I didn't pilfer.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.282
I requested and you agreed.

21:58.417 --> 22:00.518
After which I looked into
this suspect of yours,

22:00.653 --> 22:02.987
Who happened to make a few
phone calls to bill misiano.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.121
(kelly sighing)
he's a lieutenant with

22:04.256 --> 22:06.156
The buffalo crime family
who is of great interest to me.

22:06.225 --> 22:08.158
So, I am going to detain her

22:08.194 --> 22:09.360
On my side.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.095
- I'm sorry.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.164
I have a warrant
for her arrest,

22:13.299 --> 22:15.566
So I'll be detaining her
on my side.

22:15.635 --> 22:20.037
- Or, uh, wh-what we could do
is just... Meet in the middle.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.306
Take advantage of
our unlimited powers of

22:22.375 --> 22:25.041
Search and seizure at the
border. Both sides.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.378
- Fine.

22:29.582 --> 22:31.982
We'll shunt all trucks and
panel vans to one side.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.851
We'll control it on either end.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.186
(sam): See?

22:35.321 --> 22:37.154
Look at us!
It's a compromise.

22:37.223 --> 22:38.455
- Karina, may I have
a minute?

22:38.491 --> 22:40.657
Wazowski, why don't you take
ken here for a chat?

22:41.527 --> 22:42.559
- Let's go.

22:43.262 --> 22:44.528
Ken barbey.

22:45.531 --> 22:46.864
Ken barbey.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.866
I bet a lot of people
made fun of you growing up.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.335
- Not really. Why?

22:51.337 --> 22:52.669
- 'cause your name...

22:53.606 --> 22:54.872
'cause, like,
it's k-- like, ken.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.473
Like, ken an-- like,
ken, barbie.

22:56.509 --> 22:57.675
Was--

22:57.810 --> 22:59.009
Because...

22:59.011 --> 23:01.378
Were they like, "oh, look,
is that your barbie truck?"

23:01.414 --> 23:03.547
"oh, look over there, big truck,
that's a barbie truck."

23:03.583 --> 23:06.416
Or, "you got a little... Sister,
her name's skipper."

23:06.452 --> 23:07.551
Did they say that to you?

23:07.686 --> 23:09.019
That was a good one.
Did they say that?

23:09.155 --> 23:10.687
That-that's a really good one.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.324
- Oh, like, the dolls?

23:14.694 --> 23:15.960
Huh...

23:16.095 --> 23:17.894
You are the first person
to make that connection.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.563
- You want to be sarcastic
with me, right now?

23:19.565 --> 23:20.764
That's what you want to do?
Really?

23:20.800 --> 23:22.366
That's how you want to
start this off?

23:22.501 --> 23:25.001
Hey, ken, guess what?

23:25.037 --> 23:26.771
I know about your deal
with tiggy sullivan.

23:26.906 --> 23:27.905
Okay?

23:28.040 --> 23:30.140
So unless you want your
barbie world

23:30.176 --> 23:31.909
To get very complicated,

23:31.911 --> 23:33.777
You'd better start talking.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.146
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

23:36.149 --> 23:37.848
- I get nike airs, you've gotta
get better ones,

23:37.884 --> 23:39.250
I go out with the power forward,

23:39.252 --> 23:40.718
And you've got to date
the point guard.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.353
- I'm driven.
It's not about you.

23:42.355 --> 23:43.754
You've never been much
competition.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.722
- Oh, come on, man!
You have always needed to be

23:45.758 --> 23:48.125
One step ahead of me.
Ever since we were little! Look,

23:48.260 --> 23:50.393
You've proven your point, okay?

23:50.430 --> 23:51.995
Now you can go home.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.797
Blow your hair out,
get your nails done.

23:55.001 --> 23:56.533
- Well, I got my nails done
yesterday, but thanks.

23:56.569 --> 23:58.168
Didn't mom teach you anything?

24:00.907 --> 24:02.206
(scoffing)

24:02.275 --> 24:03.607
<i> (sam): You might find me</i>

24:03.643 --> 24:04.875
Very intimidating,

24:05.010 --> 24:08.345
But I am nothing compared to
how scary the mob can be.

24:08.347 --> 24:12.082
They're gonna have you
buckling at your knees.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.283
Metaphorically, of course.

24:13.319 --> 24:15.719
Because we all know that
ken's knees are like this.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.221
Like, they don't bend.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.956
They're just...

24:19.025 --> 24:21.358
He's like that.
- Okay, okay, fine.

24:22.328 --> 24:23.760
I know tiggy.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.362
But if y-- if you want more,

24:25.364 --> 24:26.830
I need protection.

24:26.866 --> 24:29.834
- Okay, I'm not promising you
the dream house, but...

24:29.969 --> 24:32.435
If your information is good,

24:32.472 --> 24:33.904
We can help you out.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.039
(softly): Okay, okay.

24:35.775 --> 24:36.907
(fanny pack unzipping)

24:36.943 --> 24:40.577
So, tiggy is coming through
today at 1:00 pm.

24:40.713 --> 24:42.513
(he exhales, relived)
- yes, she I-- yeah.

24:42.648 --> 24:43.714
(gasping)

24:43.716 --> 24:45.048
Yeah, she is!

24:45.852 --> 24:47.484
Yes, she is!

24:50.756 --> 24:52.056
(kelly): Hey. What's going on?

24:52.191 --> 24:54.658
- Hey, oh my gosh.
Tiggy just texted ken,

24:54.793 --> 24:56.326
Passing through, one o'clock.

24:56.362 --> 24:58.262
Yes?
- Yes.

24:58.264 --> 24:59.729
- Yas! Come on!

25:00.933 --> 25:03.267
No-- you're not...
This is not...

25:04.236 --> 25:05.870
- Hey, do me a favour?
- What?

25:06.005 --> 25:09.072
- The next time, don't give away
our only lead to my sister.

25:09.207 --> 25:10.941
She's a scavenger. Okay?

25:10.977 --> 25:12.209
Please.

25:14.380 --> 25:16.813
- Why are you guys
so chilly-willy with each other?

25:16.815 --> 25:18.082
(kelly): Chilly-willy?

25:18.084 --> 25:19.950
- Like, "cool", "distant",
"not friendly".

25:20.920 --> 25:22.686
- It's a long story.

25:22.821 --> 25:24.621
- So...

25:24.690 --> 25:27.291
Like, we're just gonna let her
wait out there in the cold?

25:27.426 --> 25:29.827
- No. She has a car on her side.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.828
She can go back there.
- Or, I have an idea,

25:31.864 --> 25:33.230
This is a good one.
Why doesn't she...

25:33.299 --> 25:34.298
Come sit with us and then...

25:34.367 --> 25:35.699
(kelly sighs)
...You guys can patch up

25:35.701 --> 25:37.101
Whatever is wrong.
- No, no.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.903
- You could do that!
- No. Nope, not gonna happen.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.774
(sighing): Sometimes,
you cross a line...

25:43.843 --> 25:45.709
You can't uncross.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.044
(knocking on window)
- oh!

25:47.046 --> 25:48.311
Hi.
- No! Don't open it.

25:48.347 --> 25:49.846
- I can't-- it's just...
(kelly): Don't open it.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.815
(inhaling loudly): I am not
cut out to be this rude.

25:51.817 --> 25:53.917
I can't do it. I can't do--
- trust me...

25:53.920 --> 25:54.919
- Hey.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.720
- Hi.
- So, we're all set on my end.

25:56.722 --> 25:57.521
What about you guys?

25:57.590 --> 25:59.122
- Yep, they're on
their way over.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.593
- It's kinda cold.
- Hm. It is cold.

26:02.595 --> 26:05.195
- Mind if I join you?
- No t-- not at all. No.

26:05.197 --> 26:07.097
Just don't even, s--
- don't do it.

26:07.099 --> 26:07.865
- I'm gonna do it.

26:08.000 --> 26:08.899
Here! Come on in!
- Don't.

26:09.034 --> 26:10.100
(kelly sighs)

26:10.235 --> 26:11.201
Hey, what are you doing?!

26:11.270 --> 26:12.136
(sam): I'm just--
(kelly): No!

26:12.138 --> 26:14.004
(overlapping argument)

26:14.139 --> 26:15.472
(sam): ...My boots are clean!

26:15.508 --> 26:18.675
- Argh! Come on!

26:18.744 --> 26:20.276
- Wow.

26:20.313 --> 26:21.612
It smells in here.

26:24.150 --> 26:25.949
- I don't... Know
what it could be.

26:35.027 --> 26:36.660
(hamm clears throat)

26:39.565 --> 26:40.730
- What?

26:41.767 --> 26:43.834
- I want to make something
perfectly clear.

26:45.037 --> 26:45.935
I'm a man.

26:47.306 --> 26:48.438
In fact,

26:50.042 --> 26:51.274
I'm a man's man.

26:52.478 --> 26:55.245
And according to my doctor,
I have more testosterone

26:55.314 --> 26:57.247
Coursing through my body
than a small army.

26:57.383 --> 26:59.917
So, that whole thing with
the...

26:59.919 --> 27:00.818
- The snake?

27:00.953 --> 27:03.453
(clearing throat): My, uh...

27:03.522 --> 27:08.458
My reaction to the reptile
was based on a specific phobia

27:08.494 --> 27:11.996
And had nothing to do
with masculinity

27:12.131 --> 27:14.398
Whatsoever. Okay?

27:15.835 --> 27:17.100
- Okay.

27:18.604 --> 27:20.270
(layna): What freaks you out
about her?

27:22.775 --> 27:23.874
(hamm): Let's see.

27:23.876 --> 27:27.144
Uh, for starters,
she doesn't have any legs.

27:27.279 --> 27:28.611
That's creepy. Oh!

27:28.648 --> 27:30.947
And the other thing is
she doesn't have eyelids,

27:30.983 --> 27:32.816
So she can't blink!

27:32.885 --> 27:34.418
- Yeah, but that's like
her superpower.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.953
Makes her watchful and
responsive 24-7.

27:36.989 --> 27:41.825
- And she... Literally crawls
out of her own skin

27:41.827 --> 27:42.893
On the regular.

27:43.028 --> 27:44.828
- Lucky her!

27:44.830 --> 27:46.897
Every few months, she gets to
shed her old life

27:46.966 --> 27:48.699
And start a whole new one.

27:51.971 --> 27:53.536
I wish I could do that.

27:55.341 --> 27:56.173
- Hm.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.245
(hamm): Maybe you can.

28:07.252 --> 28:08.385
(sam): You turned that
department around

28:08.520 --> 28:10.120
All on your own.
(katrina): Nah, I--

28:10.255 --> 28:11.588
I mean, not entirely.
(sam): It was.

28:11.590 --> 28:12.589
(kelly sighs, annoyed)
it was.

28:12.625 --> 28:14.057
(katrina): Why am I
being modest? It was me.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.125
(sam): It was you!
(laughter)

28:15.260 --> 28:16.060
(sam): Yes, it was you!

28:16.195 --> 28:17.327
- Yes, it was!
- Yeah!

28:18.364 --> 28:20.864
- Yeah!
(sam): Yes! Yes, girl!

28:20.866 --> 28:21.731
- I know.

28:21.767 --> 28:22.933
She's just jealous because

28:23.002 --> 28:24.668
My case clearance rate is
higher than hers.

28:24.670 --> 28:25.969
- Is it really?

28:25.971 --> 28:27.804
Okay, I need you now
to go into great detail,

28:27.873 --> 28:29.439
What is the secret of your track
record?

28:30.776 --> 28:33.476
- I have a three-point system.
(sam): Three? Interesting.

28:33.512 --> 28:34.945
I'm more of a five-stepper
myself.

28:35.014 --> 28:36.079
- Five?!
- I do five.

28:36.115 --> 28:37.247
(kelly coughs)
(sam): Duff, are you okay?

28:37.316 --> 28:38.215
Do you need water?

28:38.350 --> 28:40.317
(coughing): No, gonna let
the window down,

28:40.386 --> 28:41.951
Get some fresh air...

28:41.987 --> 28:43.553
(inhaling and exhaling deeply)

28:43.589 --> 28:44.955
Ah, that's better.

28:45.090 --> 28:48.358
I had to let some
of that nerd out. Whoo!

28:48.394 --> 28:50.294
Let some of that cool back in.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.295
Oh, hey.

28:53.298 --> 28:56.199
Pantsuit nation, she's here.
Let's go!

28:58.003 --> 28:58.969
(siren trilling)

28:58.971 --> 29:01.237
(kelly): Police! Stop.

29:02.174 --> 29:04.041
Put the car in park.
Turn it off.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.142
(sam): Step out of the vehicle!
Slowly!

29:07.680 --> 29:10.079
- I'm sorry. What's--
what's going on here?

29:12.551 --> 29:14.251
- That's what you're gonna
tell us.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.153
(kelly): Alright,
search the van.

29:16.155 --> 29:18.021
Come with me. Move. Move!

29:19.691 --> 29:20.623
- I got it.

29:21.193 --> 29:21.991
- 'kay.

29:24.063 --> 29:26.062
- Hi, maureen, it's tiggy.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.530
Listen, my work's going long.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.533
Could you give sol his dinner?

29:29.535 --> 29:31.467
I should be home by...
(dog barking)

29:31.504 --> 29:33.804
(man):
♪ blowing into the desert... ♪

29:33.939 --> 29:35.205
- I'll be home later.

29:35.340 --> 29:37.341
- ♪ setting all
the captives free ♪

29:37.476 --> 29:41.011
- Hey! Jacob!
You want this 3000$?

29:41.013 --> 29:43.847
I suggest you muzzle yourself
and your mangy mutt too!

29:43.982 --> 29:45.415
It's hard enough to breathe
in this tin can

29:45.484 --> 29:47.284
Without you sucking
all the air out.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.118
- I provide a special service.

29:49.155 --> 29:51.020
- You own a crap
rental-car place

29:51.056 --> 29:51.955
That can't even stay afloat

29:52.090 --> 29:53.957
Without resorting to
human trafficking.

29:54.026 --> 29:55.292
(jacob): I prefer the term

29:55.294 --> 29:56.960
"ferrying for a fee".

29:57.029 --> 29:57.961
(tiggy): Yeah, you know what?

29:58.096 --> 29:59.229
That's what my people
said this would be,

29:59.364 --> 30:01.097
But this ain't ferrying, okay?
It's depraved.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.566
And if I don't get back home,

30:02.635 --> 30:03.967
My son is gonna be taken
from me.

30:04.102 --> 30:05.969
- ♪ joy is flowing into
the desert ♪

30:06.038 --> 30:07.304
(tiggy): Jacob!

30:07.306 --> 30:10.374
- ♪ setting all
the captives free ♪

30:12.178 --> 30:15.178
- Not all the captives.
(dog whines)

30:15.214 --> 30:16.246
(dog barks)

30:21.320 --> 30:22.853
- Well, I was at this
truck stop,

30:22.855 --> 30:24.721
I was hoping to hitch a ride
to niagara falls,

30:24.857 --> 30:27.724
And this lady comes over,
says she'll give me 2000 bucks

30:27.860 --> 30:30.127
If I just drive the van
across the border, so...

30:30.129 --> 30:32.262
- Did she say why?
- No.

30:32.397 --> 30:33.597
She just gave me cash

30:33.666 --> 30:35.666
And said to meet her at the
sonic car rental in oakville.

30:35.801 --> 30:38.168
- I am gonna get hamm to
head over there right away.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.502
- Yeah, also have him
pull a list

30:39.538 --> 30:41.138
Of all the cars they have
rented out right now.

30:41.273 --> 30:42.338
Maybe it's a round-trip.

30:44.076 --> 30:45.876
But keep it to y--
- she's coming across

30:46.011 --> 30:46.877
In a sonic car rental.

30:46.879 --> 30:48.878
- Great.
- ...Yourself.

30:49.748 --> 30:50.947
(door closes)
stay there.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.620
- So, we assume tiggy's
gonna try

30:56.622 --> 30:58.488
To cross over using the
national customs processing lane

30:58.557 --> 31:00.490
Which is ken's lane,
on the far right,

31:00.526 --> 31:01.892
So now, I plan to focus
my attention

31:01.894 --> 31:04.227
On the sonic car rental vehicles
over on the us side.

31:04.296 --> 31:05.495
Thank you for your help, guys.

31:05.564 --> 31:08.564
Oh! If I miss something -
and that's a big "if" -

31:08.601 --> 31:10.233
Then, you'll get your chance.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.569
(softly): Yeah.
(long sigh)

31:14.440 --> 31:15.706
- What do you think?

31:15.708 --> 31:18.475
- I think my sister would crawl
across cut glass

31:18.610 --> 31:19.876
To get to tiggy before me.

31:20.011 --> 31:21.245
If karina doesn't find tiggy,

31:21.380 --> 31:22.379
It's because she's already
crossed.

31:22.514 --> 31:24.648
The question is: Where the hell
would she go?

31:24.783 --> 31:26.215
She knows she's been made.

31:30.723 --> 31:33.790
- Hey, naz, could you check
on something for me?

31:34.726 --> 31:36.392
(train crossing dinging)

31:51.009 --> 31:53.877
- Hi, you!
(laughing)

31:54.012 --> 31:56.813
Mm! Let me take that.

31:56.882 --> 31:58.815
How come that's so heavy?

31:58.817 --> 32:01.084
(sol): I don't know.
Layna said not to look.

32:01.219 --> 32:03.353
(maureen): Well, I swear, if
you didn't eat your lunch...

32:03.355 --> 32:07.524
I will not tolerate you
wasting food.

32:07.659 --> 32:09.092
Okay?

32:10.963 --> 32:12.095
(naz): Ma'am?

32:12.164 --> 32:14.497
My name is detective
taai nazeer, I'm with the gtpd.

32:15.567 --> 32:17.066
I'm looking for
your daughter-in-law.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.771
- Yeah, well...
Good luck finding her.

32:20.906 --> 32:22.939
- You weren't supposed
to open it!

32:26.779 --> 32:29.846
- Hey, buddy,
where'd you find that?

32:29.848 --> 32:33.249
- Sol, honey,
where'd you get the money?

32:33.385 --> 32:34.884
- I don't know.

32:37.923 --> 32:39.523
- You guys are gonna have
to come with me.

32:39.525 --> 32:42.392
(maureen sighs
and mutters indistinctly)

32:42.461 --> 32:44.061
- It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.163
(sam):<i> Hey, naz, what happened?</i>

32:46.165 --> 32:48.464
- Well, I just brought in
rick gray's mother, maureen.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.734
Tiggy left a message on her
phone about a half an hour ago.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.069
I just sent it to you.

32:52.071 --> 32:53.936
<i> Take a listen.</i>
- Okay.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.074
(tiggy):<i> Hi, maureen,</i>
<i> it's tiggy.</i>

32:57.209 --> 32:58.742
<i> Listen, my work's going long</i>

32:58.811 --> 33:00.610
<i> Could you give sol his dinner?</i>

33:00.746 --> 33:03.347
<i> I should be home by...</i>
<i> (dog barks)</i>

33:03.482 --> 33:04.948
<i> I'll be home later.</i>

33:05.083 --> 33:06.949
(kelly): And... How long
were you in buffalo?

33:06.986 --> 33:09.485
(karina): Thank you.
Come through. Come on.

33:09.521 --> 33:10.887
Stop.

33:10.889 --> 33:12.956
- Hey, there. Karina duff,
buffalo rp,

33:12.958 --> 33:14.224
Can I see your passport?
(dog barking)

33:15.194 --> 33:16.460
It's a cute dog.
- Thank you.

33:16.462 --> 33:17.427
- Can you open the trunk?

33:17.463 --> 33:18.761
- Yes, ma'am.

33:18.797 --> 33:20.630
(trunk clicks open)
(shushing)

33:20.765 --> 33:22.866
(dog barks)

33:22.868 --> 33:25.035
(dog barks in the distance)
(kelly speaks indistinctly)

33:25.170 --> 33:26.569
- You plan on having
more travel?

33:27.105 --> 33:28.838
(barking)

33:28.973 --> 33:30.440
(kelly): Thank you very much.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.776
(kelly sighing): Okay, can I see
your passport, please, sir?

33:32.778 --> 33:34.110
- Hi, baby.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.445
Alright, you can go ahead.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.780
(barking)
(karina): Go. Go, go, go!

33:37.816 --> 33:38.982
Bye, pup.

33:41.487 --> 33:42.518
(karina): Forward, please!

33:43.989 --> 33:47.057
- Can you please,
please shut that dog up?

33:47.059 --> 33:49.226
- Having a dog makes us look
less suspicious.

33:49.228 --> 33:51.661
(dog barking)
just relax, okay?

33:51.797 --> 33:53.396
- Duff, we need to stop
that driver.

33:53.399 --> 33:54.531
The one with the dog.

33:54.666 --> 33:55.732
- Karina already checked him.
It's clean.

33:55.867 --> 33:56.899
- Trust me.

34:01.006 --> 34:02.272
(kelly): Alright, let's pull him
over there.

34:02.341 --> 34:04.407
(sam): Yeah.
(dog barking)

34:04.410 --> 34:05.275
- How you doing?

34:05.344 --> 34:06.143
(officer): Pull over here,
please.

34:06.278 --> 34:07.644
- Karina duff.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.612
(dog barking)

34:09.681 --> 34:11.214
Uh, sorry, can you...

34:11.750 --> 34:12.949
Hold on.

34:31.170 --> 34:32.702
- I've already been checked
on the us side.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.704
What's this about?
(sam): Sir, get out of the car.

34:34.773 --> 34:35.839
- Why?

34:35.841 --> 34:37.174
- Now!

34:37.309 --> 34:39.208
(dog whines)
(sam): Remove the dog.

34:58.163 --> 35:00.997
- Uh... God!

35:06.472 --> 35:08.138
(sam): Oh god,
this has to be it.

35:08.207 --> 35:10.740
This has to be it!
- What are you talking about?

35:10.876 --> 35:12.542
- When you said I couldn't keep
information to myself,

35:12.611 --> 35:14.010
But I did.
I kept it to myself!

35:14.079 --> 35:15.812
- Yeah, but you weren't supposed
to keep it from me!

35:15.814 --> 35:17.547
- Don't waste your time,
I already checked this car.

35:17.583 --> 35:19.382
- Well, you didn't check it
good enough.

35:19.384 --> 35:20.750
- Oh, I forgot!

35:20.752 --> 35:23.553
You need to look for work up
here, in canada, do you?

35:23.688 --> 35:25.855
Just find ways
to keep yourself busy.

35:25.924 --> 35:27.223
- Alright, look, karina,

35:27.259 --> 35:29.225
What I know about you is
you may be very smart,

35:29.294 --> 35:30.226
But you're cocky,

35:30.262 --> 35:32.963
And being cocky...
Makes you lazy.

35:33.098 --> 35:34.931
And one thing I know about
my partner, here,

35:34.967 --> 35:36.833
She is anything but lazy.

35:36.968 --> 35:40.103
- Yeah. And sh-- I'm smart too.
Tell her I'm smart.

35:40.105 --> 35:41.304
- Tiggy sullivan is in this car.

35:41.439 --> 35:43.073
I'm gonna pick every
little piece of it apart

35:43.075 --> 35:44.374
Until I find her.

35:45.344 --> 35:46.442
- What?

35:47.412 --> 35:49.512
- Yeah. That's nice.

35:51.150 --> 35:53.183
(sighing): Look,
she better be in here

35:53.185 --> 35:55.252
Or I will never
talk to you again.

35:55.254 --> 35:57.454
- You just can't admit
when you're wrong, can you?

35:57.456 --> 35:59.856
- She has to be in here.
This doesn't make any sense.

35:59.925 --> 36:01.958
(clicking)
oh, jesus!

36:08.433 --> 36:09.999
Hey, ms. Sullivan.

36:10.134 --> 36:11.500
How's it going?

36:30.889 --> 36:33.823
(door clangs)
(lock clinking)

36:36.161 --> 36:38.394
(footsteps move away)

36:43.101 --> 36:44.434
(fingers tapping)

36:46.104 --> 36:49.105
- Are you gonna hold my hand?
- Not anymore.

36:49.141 --> 36:51.107
- Lay, come on.

36:51.176 --> 36:52.842
I need you.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.311
I'm scared.

36:54.446 --> 36:56.046
We gotta stick together.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.586
Did you know what I meant

37:03.622 --> 37:05.722
When I told you to meet me
at square one?

37:12.397 --> 37:13.630
Jesus, lay.

37:14.799 --> 37:15.865
No wonder I'm in this mess

37:16.001 --> 37:18.334
When you were all I had
to lean on.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.536
Back to square one.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.239
Where it all started.

37:24.343 --> 37:25.875
Mom's old house.

37:25.944 --> 37:27.910
It's been empty for years.

37:34.086 --> 37:35.285
- You've been holding my hand,

37:35.420 --> 37:38.021
Dragging me around with you
since I was a baby.

37:39.758 --> 37:42.292
But I think I was just a prop
in your life.

37:43.695 --> 37:45.628
Someone to kick,
someone to blame.

37:45.664 --> 37:46.896
- Stop it, sissy.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.465
You know I love you.

37:50.302 --> 37:51.534
- Maybe.

37:53.905 --> 37:56.172
But all those times
I held your hand,

37:56.174 --> 37:59.509
It's 'cause I trusted you were
gonna take me somewhere good.

37:59.511 --> 38:01.110
But that never happened.

38:02.380 --> 38:03.846
(tiggy): Better than
going nowhere.

38:05.183 --> 38:07.250
Which is where you'd be
if you were on your own.

38:11.857 --> 38:12.856
- I'm talking to the cops.

38:12.858 --> 38:14.124
I'm gonna cooperate.

38:15.560 --> 38:18.128
- You cross that line with me,
there's no turning back.

38:19.131 --> 38:21.131
- The line's
already crossed, tig.

38:21.266 --> 38:23.265
(soft music)

38:49.127 --> 38:50.226
- What?

38:50.361 --> 38:51.961
- What's your story?

38:51.997 --> 38:53.429
You got family here?

38:53.465 --> 38:54.997
- Nope.

38:55.067 --> 38:56.399
- So, where you from?

38:56.435 --> 38:57.900
- I'm from winnipeg.

38:57.936 --> 38:59.569
- Where are you from, bodhi?

38:59.571 --> 39:00.536
- Here.

39:01.406 --> 39:02.505
You know, I know where
everyone

39:02.640 --> 39:04.574
Working in this place
comes from, except this dude.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.909
That makes me wonder
how he got in here.

39:06.978 --> 39:10.379
- He got in here through
me and my mother, okay?

39:11.316 --> 39:12.115
- Uh...

39:12.984 --> 39:14.651
Oh, hey, nelson,
what's up?

39:16.921 --> 39:18.254
- Just shut up, bodhi.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.660
- What's the deal with that?

39:24.629 --> 39:26.262
- Someone tried to
rip him off.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.599
Guess they won't be
trying that again.

39:29.601 --> 39:31.834
(soft music continues)

39:34.706 --> 39:36.740
(naz): I'm glad that tip
panned out for you.

39:36.875 --> 39:37.740
- Yeah.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.008
(stuttering): Thank you.

39:39.010 --> 39:40.543
We never would've gotten tiggy
without it.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.345
- Yeah. Well, I'm gonna
go home and get some rest.

39:42.480 --> 39:43.546
- Yeah.

39:43.582 --> 39:47.016
Hey, naz. Can I, uh, just wait.
Uh, your eye...

39:47.151 --> 39:48.284
Wh-what really happened?

39:48.353 --> 39:51.554
I know that you... You don't
play volleyball.

39:51.689 --> 39:54.023
(clears throat): Well, if you
really want to know,

39:54.092 --> 39:55.959
I went out on a call,

39:56.094 --> 39:57.227
With davidson,

39:57.362 --> 39:58.561
And three other guys
from drug squad.

39:58.696 --> 40:01.631
I got into it,
with a target and...

40:01.633 --> 40:04.033
Uh... When I called
for back-up...

40:04.169 --> 40:05.768
- Nobody came.

40:05.771 --> 40:09.305
- Strangely, their radios
were all down.

40:10.475 --> 40:12.175
- Was it because of the kelly
and keegan thing?

40:12.244 --> 40:13.776
(naz): They're sending me
a message.

40:13.845 --> 40:16.745
That my loyalty is in
the wrong place.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.850
- What y'all whispering about?

40:21.820 --> 40:23.586
- Nothing. Just that
I am exhausted.

40:23.721 --> 40:25.922
And I will see you later,
partner.

40:29.461 --> 40:30.659
- What's going on?

40:30.695 --> 40:33.196
(sam): Time to go talk to the
queen of stockwood!

40:33.198 --> 40:34.797
That's what's going on.

40:34.866 --> 40:36.565
Saddle up, partner!

40:37.735 --> 40:39.134
(makes the sound of galloping
with her hands)

40:44.208 --> 40:45.809
- I think you might've
forgot the sugar.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.409
(laughing): What?!

40:48.813 --> 40:50.079
Oh my god!

40:50.148 --> 40:51.147
Oh.
- See?

40:51.282 --> 40:53.483
- You're right, it's horrible!

40:53.618 --> 40:54.751
(nathan indistinctly)

40:54.753 --> 40:56.686
(laughter continues)

40:59.758 --> 41:02.625
<i> - I told you,</i>
<i> my business is clean.</i>

41:02.760 --> 41:03.559
<i> - Yeah?</i>

41:03.595 --> 41:04.594
Then why did you transport

41:04.663 --> 41:07.564
A load of mdma
into the states last night?

41:07.566 --> 41:09.365
(scoffing): That was flowers.

41:09.434 --> 41:11.901
- Why'd you pay someone to
drive your van out of buffalo?

41:11.937 --> 41:13.169
- Carpal tunnel.

41:13.238 --> 41:14.504
I can't gear shift.

41:14.639 --> 41:15.672
- Oh, I see,

41:15.807 --> 41:17.907
Then, that's why you put
yourself in the dashboard.

41:18.042 --> 41:19.442
Okay, that makes sense.

41:19.511 --> 41:22.511
- And someone hid
50,000$ in cash

41:22.547 --> 41:24.179
In your son's backpack.

41:26.718 --> 41:27.917
(kelly): Yeah.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.253
- You know what?

41:30.255 --> 41:33.122
That scumbag randy bowen's
stayed at my house a few days.

41:34.459 --> 41:36.593
He had to stash his drug money
somewhere for safekeeping.

41:36.728 --> 41:38.728
(kelly): Hm.
- Sol must've found it.

41:38.797 --> 41:41.130
- Hm. Yeah.

41:41.132 --> 41:43.032
That's plausible.
- Yeah.

41:43.068 --> 41:45.268
- You know, speaking of
randy bowen,

41:45.270 --> 41:46.736
You don't seem to care
that he's dead.

41:47.572 --> 41:48.871
Why is that?

41:48.907 --> 41:51.341
- No need to get all emotional
over someone I barely knew.

41:51.476 --> 41:53.109
- Your sister knew him
pretty well.

41:53.111 --> 41:54.210
- Yeah, that's her problem.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.812
(kelly): Actually...

41:55.947 --> 41:57.547
Yours too.

41:57.616 --> 41:59.549
You started working
with randy

41:59.684 --> 42:00.884
After you took over
for rick.

42:01.019 --> 42:02.952
Built yourself a nice little
empire together,

42:02.988 --> 42:04.621
Bringing in drugs

42:04.623 --> 42:06.755
For bill misiano.
(tiggy): You know what?

42:08.393 --> 42:10.593
I thought we knew each other
better than this.

42:11.362 --> 42:13.029
I was an open book.

42:13.164 --> 42:14.764
And jackie...

42:14.833 --> 42:16.966
Helped you
every step of the way.

42:17.002 --> 42:18.434
- Has she?

42:19.704 --> 42:22.705
Or has she just helped you
get information about us?

42:22.741 --> 42:24.107
- My family has nothing to do
with this.

42:24.242 --> 42:26.576
(kelly): Actually,
that's not true.

42:26.711 --> 42:29.312
'cause layna, looking
pretty good for a murder.

42:30.782 --> 42:35.151
You, jackie and layna are all
a part of conspiracy to traffic.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.320
- Yeah, and sol is gonna spend
the rest of his childhood

42:37.455 --> 42:38.588
Living with his grandmother.

42:39.858 --> 42:41.457
- Unless you agree
to work with us.

42:41.526 --> 42:44.526
- Everything you have on me
is circumstantial.

42:44.563 --> 42:46.796
And I'm admitting to nothing.

42:46.798 --> 42:50.800
- Okay. Are you really sure that
your sister's not gonna talk?

42:51.970 --> 42:54.970
(kelly): She seems
pretty talkative to me.

42:58.944 --> 43:00.276
(exhaling)

43:02.080 --> 43:03.346
- Okay, how about this?

43:03.415 --> 43:05.548
You two get off my back,

43:06.952 --> 43:08.418
Cut me a decent deal,

43:11.889 --> 43:14.456
I'll hand over the man
who killed randy bowen.
