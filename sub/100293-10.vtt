00:05.000 --> 00:06.440
We're in the very far future.

00:06.480 --> 00:07.600

00:07.640 --> 00:09.040
Cyberdrones.

00:09.080 --> 00:11.200
(SCREAMING)

00:11.240 --> 00:12.240
No!

00:12.280 --> 00:14.400
Go with the humans. Help them.
Get them out of here.

00:14.440 --> 00:16.760
You won't make it
back to the TARDIS alive.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.960
We know where you are.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.760
We will find you.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.160
The Boundary - it's where
we've been trying to get to.

00:24.200 --> 00:25.240
A gateway, a direct route

00:25.280 --> 00:27.080
out of here
into another random part

00:27.120 --> 00:28.040
of the universe.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.960
Whoa! Wow!

00:31.000 --> 00:32.240
Be afraid, Doctor,

00:32.280 --> 00:34.960
because everything
is about to change.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.520
DOCTOR: How are you here?

01:10.560 --> 01:12.240
MASTER: Take my hand.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.800
Never.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.440
Take my hand

01:15.480 --> 01:18.960
or I turn them into
tiny human dolls right here.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.840
How have you connected
Gallifrey to that Boundary?

01:21.880 --> 01:25.600
Fine. You really want me
to show you I'm serious?

01:25.640 --> 01:28.000
Eenie, meenie, miney...

01:28.040 --> 01:30.080
Miney.

01:30.120 --> 01:34.040
Fine, I'll play your game.

01:34.080 --> 01:37.160
- I'll be back.
- She won't.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.880
And it's not a game.

01:38.920 --> 01:40.520
Good luck, humans.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.200
RYAN: We have to go
through there.

01:44.240 --> 01:45.680
- We have to go and get her.
- No,

01:45.720 --> 01:46.880
we have to wait for the others.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.360
(RUMBLING)

01:54.800 --> 01:57.000
They're here.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.400
(BESCOT GRUNTS)

02:00.440 --> 02:02.840
- Over here!
- Go, go, go, go!

02:04.280 --> 02:06.160
BESCOT: I'll cover you!

02:11.880 --> 02:13.920
Come on! Bescot!

02:13.960 --> 02:15.000
Argh!

02:17.600 --> 02:18.800
No!

02:27.760 --> 02:29.320
The ship is ours.

02:33.480 --> 02:37.480
Look upon my work, Doctor,
and despair.

02:41.800 --> 02:44.240
Remember how we used to run
through those streets

02:44.280 --> 02:46.080
as children?

02:46.120 --> 02:48.520
The alleys where we'd hide
from Borusa

02:48.560 --> 02:50.000
as we skipped classes?

02:52.400 --> 02:53.400
All gone now.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.280
Come on,
ask me why I did this.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.480
Why did you do this?

03:02.520 --> 03:05.000
Not telling you. (LAUGHS)

03:06.080 --> 03:07.080
Oh, crack a smile.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.840
- Proud of yourself?
- Definitely.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.360
All this death -
finally made you happy?

03:11.400 --> 03:12.280
Ecstatic.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.640
And has it calmed all the rage?

03:18.600 --> 03:21.080
I don't think
anything will ever do that.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.960
We're going to take a tour
through the capital,

03:27.000 --> 03:29.640
or its ruins, at least.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.560
Things I need to show you.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.680
And, um, I know you're worried
about your friends.

03:37.160 --> 03:39.240
Plotting how to get away.
I can see it in your eyes.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.800
But you can't help them,

03:42.840 --> 03:44.440
so don't even think about it.

03:48.640 --> 03:50.880
Down you come. That's it.
Yaz, come on.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.440
Where's Bescot?

03:53.480 --> 03:54.960
They killed her.
We have to go back for her.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.320
No, no, no.
No, you can't do that, mate.

03:56.360 --> 03:57.800
Listen, don't tell me
what I can't do.

03:59.080 --> 04:01.320
She had nightmares

04:01.360 --> 04:03.760
about being captured
and converted.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.160
I can't let that happen.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.840
Do you really think
that she would want you

04:06.880 --> 04:08.240
to go back there
and risk your life?

04:08.280 --> 04:10.520
I owe her. And what difference
does it make anyway?

04:10.560 --> 04:12.040
We don't stand a chance here.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.400
We are stuck on a ship
stacked with Cybermen.

04:14.440 --> 04:15.440
Four humans sticking out

04:15.480 --> 04:17.120
on every surveillance system
they've got.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.160
He's right,

04:18.200 --> 04:19.880
and I've been thinking
about that. I've got an idea.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.440
It's a bit of a mad one -
quite dangerous

04:21.480 --> 04:22.600
and it might not work -

04:22.640 --> 04:25.160
but we've got form with plans
like that, ain't we, Yaz?

04:25.200 --> 04:27.720
Yeah, our speciality.

04:29.480 --> 04:30.680
How dangerous?

04:38.440 --> 04:40.160
GRAHAM: We use their armour

04:40.200 --> 04:41.520
so they don't notice us.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.920
That way, we can move around
and get off the ship.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.920
So you want us to disguise
ourselves as Cybermen?

04:46.960 --> 04:48.160
Have you ever opened one up?

04:48.200 --> 04:49.400
Well, I guess
it won't be pleasant.

04:49.440 --> 04:50.840
They're full of human remains.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.480
Well, I don't need it
spelling out, do I?

04:52.520 --> 04:55.840
You can't fake being a Cyberman
for any length of time.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.600
We only need to do it
for long enough

04:57.640 --> 04:58.680
to get us out of here.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.440
If you do the bodies,
I could disable

05:04.480 --> 05:06.520
the suit connection
into the shared neural network.

05:06.560 --> 05:07.920
It's insane.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.400
Well, I didn't say it was
a perfect plan, did I?

05:10.440 --> 05:12.320
But it is
the best one we've got.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.520
This is my weapon store.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.360
This all you got?

05:25.400 --> 05:26.600
Well, it's quite hard

05:26.640 --> 05:28.360
to get deliveries out here,
you know.

05:28.400 --> 05:32.560
I had hoped I'd fought
my last battle a long time ago.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.200
Still... (CHUCKLES)

05:36.440 --> 05:38.400
This old general
still knows a few tricks.

05:38.440 --> 05:40.000
I'm not too sure about weapons.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.640
Yeah, well,
I'm sure about Cybermen.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.760
Now, you fight them or you die.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.760
They don't have any mercy.

05:47.800 --> 05:53.000
You can be a pacifist tomorrow.
Today, you have to survive.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.080
MASTER: Ah!

05:59.120 --> 06:01.800
The citadel,
the heart of Gallifrey.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.200
Recognise the old place?

06:04.240 --> 06:06.600
I was thinking
I might knock through there,

06:06.640 --> 06:08.840
put a wet room there,

06:08.880 --> 06:11.600
screening room there.
(CHUCKLES)

06:11.640 --> 06:14.120
Torture room in the cellar,
naturally.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.080
Oh.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.800
And see through there?

06:18.840 --> 06:21.480
The Panopticon.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.640
Well, what's left, which, uh...

06:23.680 --> 06:25.640
...which isn't much.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.360
We had some fun there,
didn't we, eh?

06:36.600 --> 06:37.600
Graduated.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.840
Assassinated presidents.

06:41.880 --> 06:43.240
(GIGGLES)

06:43.280 --> 06:45.480
The best of times!

06:45.520 --> 06:49.040
But I thought here would be
a fitting place to end this.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.240

06:51.280 --> 06:54.080

07:01.440 --> 07:04.800

at the Boundary.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.320
Better extend
the hand of friendship.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.080

to conversion-shame you.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.240
come through it.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.240
Join me.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.880
Why would we join you?

07:53.920 --> 07:57.040
Because I have a planet
going spare right here.

07:58.640 --> 08:02.120
The planet formerly known
as Gallifrey.

08:02.160 --> 08:05.440
No. Don't bring them here.
This is between you and me.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.160
Don't heckle, dear.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.480
I can always decide
to cut you short.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.240
I promise
I'll roll out the red carpet.

08:18.280 --> 08:21.680

in the blood of our people.

08:42.680 --> 08:43.680

you should send
a death squadron.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.920
Do you call it
a death squadron?

08:46.960 --> 08:48.920
A deletion squad.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.800
No, a recruitment patrol,

08:50.840 --> 08:52.880
a human juicing party,

08:52.920 --> 08:56.560
to eliminate the three humans
left alive on that planet.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.080
They're weak.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.760
It shouldn't take much.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.920

10:52.920 --> 10:54.720
she was the best person
you'd ever met.

10:56.360 --> 10:57.560
You know what, Yaz?

10:58.920 --> 10:59.920
I think you are.

You ain't got a time machine

12:57.680 --> 12:59.120
I told you before

12:59.160 --> 13:01.600
that everything you knew
was a lie.

13:01.640 --> 13:04.280
Well, now you get
to face the truth,

13:04.320 --> 13:06.000
with me at your side.

13:06.040 --> 13:07.400
Do you really think
I'm going to believe

13:07.440 --> 13:08.840
anything that comes
out of your mouth?

13:09.920 --> 13:11.720
Do you remember this place,
Doctor?

13:15.680 --> 13:17.920
Next to the Panopticon,

13:17.960 --> 13:19.720
the Chamber of the Matrix,

13:19.760 --> 13:24.000
the Repository
of all Time Lord knowledge,

13:24.040 --> 13:27.480
a databank of
every Time Lord consciousness,

13:27.520 --> 13:29.920
living and dead.

13:29.960 --> 13:33.200
Every experience
and every memory.

13:33.240 --> 13:36.520
The lived history of our race.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.960
I...I destroyed a lot
of things, but not this...

13:39.000 --> 13:40.960
...trove of secrets.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.440
This is what started it all.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.720
I-I was just playing,

13:48.760 --> 13:49.880
hacking the system.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.840
(STAMMERS)
I-I got lost in there.

13:51.880 --> 13:56.320
And then I found everything.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.200
Ah!

13:58.240 --> 14:00.600
Truth and reconciliation time,
Doctor.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.920
Well, maybe not reconciliation.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.360
But time you saw the truth
for yourself.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.240
What truth?

14:08.280 --> 14:10.400
(YELPS)

14:10.440 --> 14:12.080
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

14:12.120 --> 14:13.760

14:13.800 --> 14:16.240

14:16.280 --> 14:17.720
Whatever you want with me...

14:19.240 --> 14:20.960
...fine.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.320
But save my friends.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.360
Don't let the Cybermen
take them.

14:26.480 --> 14:29.000
If the history between us
means anything to you...

14:29.040 --> 14:32.240
I do believe you're appealing
to my better nature.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.160
And we both know
I don't have one.

14:34.200 --> 14:37.080
I'm not going to help them,
and neither are you.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.320
And the history between us
does mean something.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.440
It's the rage and pain
in my hearts.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.240
I'm sending you
deep into the Matrix

14:51.280 --> 14:53.040
to understand the truth...

14:54.400 --> 14:56.320
...of Gallifrey

14:56.360 --> 14:58.440
and of the Time Lords.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.240
Brace yourself.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.200
This is going to hurt.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.680
(MUFFLED BREATHING)

we are on optimal proximity

16:12.440 --> 16:13.880

16:13.920 --> 16:17.840
Boundary gateway is reopening.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.840
GRAHAM:
We've got to get off this ship.

16:40.280 --> 16:43.160
(BREATHES SLOWLY)

16:44.360 --> 16:46.680
MASTER: Welcome, Doctor.

16:48.320 --> 16:49.600
Are you suffering comfortably?

16:51.080 --> 16:52.160
Then, I'll begin.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.760
Once upon a time...

16:55.800 --> 16:56.840
No.

16:58.720 --> 17:01.720
Once upon several times,

17:01.760 --> 17:03.600
before the Time Lords,

17:03.640 --> 17:05.960
before everything we know,

17:06.000 --> 17:07.680
there was an explorer.

17:07.720 --> 17:10.400
Her name was Tecteun...

17:11.640 --> 17:15.160
...from a little-regarded,
sparsely populated planet

17:15.200 --> 17:17.400
called Gallifrey.

17:17.440 --> 17:20.720
Tecteun was the first
of Gallifrey's indigenous race,

17:20.760 --> 17:23.120
the Shobogans,
to develop space travel.

17:24.320 --> 17:27.200
Dangerous,
unsophisticated space travel.

17:28.400 --> 17:32.520
She took risks to explore
the worlds and galaxies

17:32.560 --> 17:34.120
beyond her home.

17:34.160 --> 17:37.160
And it was on one of these
distant, deserted worlds

17:37.200 --> 17:38.760
on the far edge
of another galaxy

17:38.800 --> 17:40.160
she found something...

17:41.240 --> 17:42.640
...impossible.

17:43.840 --> 17:44.960
A gateway.

17:46.160 --> 17:49.960
A boundary into another
unknown dimension or universe.

17:51.520 --> 17:54.160
Tecteun glimpsed the infinite

17:54.200 --> 17:56.000
through that gateway.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.160
And beneath the monument,
she found...

18:00.240 --> 18:01.240
...a child.

18:02.520 --> 18:04.000
Abandoned.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.520
Alone.

18:05.560 --> 18:09.080
Thrown through, seemingly,
from the other unknown realm.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.400
Tecteun had a choice to make -

18:13.440 --> 18:16.320
abandon or save the child?

18:16.360 --> 18:18.640
She chose
to rescue the foundling

18:18.680 --> 18:22.320
and adopt this refugee
from another realm as her own.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.960
Together,
they explored the universe.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.960
The child grew older,

18:28.000 --> 18:31.160
and finally Tecteun
returned to Gallifrey

18:31.200 --> 18:32.880
with her new child.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.120
Like any parent,

18:35.160 --> 18:38.280
Tecteun wanted
to understand her child.

18:38.320 --> 18:42.240
She searched for clues
as to the child's identity -

18:42.280 --> 18:46.520
where she might be from,
what species she could be.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.240
But the child would not yield

18:48.280 --> 18:50.680
any secrets
Tecteun could understand.

18:50.720 --> 18:54.240
The child remained a mystery...

18:55.320 --> 18:57.040
...until...

18:57.080 --> 19:00.920
Playing with a friend,
like any other child...

19:02.240 --> 19:04.080
...there was an accident.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.120
A catastrophe...

19:10.760 --> 19:13.360
...for Tecteun,

19:13.400 --> 19:16.360
for the child she'd saved,

19:16.400 --> 19:17.680
now lost to her.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.440
Or so she thought.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.760
The child regenerated.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.200
The first regeneration
of any person

19:48.240 --> 19:50.400
on the planet of Gallifrey.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.720
(LOW RUMBLING)

19:59.200 --> 20:01.480

20:18.080 --> 20:20.880

now closed.

20:20.920 --> 20:25.280
There is no escape for humans.

20:38.920 --> 20:41.200
First trap's sprung. They fell
for the old bio-dampener

20:41.240 --> 20:43.720
Decoy Human Signal trick -
textbook! (LAUGHS)

20:49.200 --> 20:51.360
Thought they'd last longer
than that.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.920
KO SHARMUS: All right, Ryan,
they're on the march.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.360
You know what to do.
We're relying on you.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.320
Did I mention I've never been
the greatest shot?

21:07.640 --> 21:08.840
Now!

21:08.880 --> 21:11.400
(TICKING)

21:19.760 --> 21:21.360
Whoa! I did it!

21:21.400 --> 21:24.560
In the hoop! Swish! (LAUGHS)

21:24.600 --> 21:25.960
Great shot.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.680
You come for humans,
you come for me,

21:28.720 --> 21:30.120
Ryan Sinclair!

21:30.160 --> 21:32.600
We defeated the Cybermen.

21:32.640 --> 21:34.720
Well, me. Technically, it's me.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.280
There are always more.
Get inside now.

21:37.320 --> 21:39.160
Now!

21:46.720 --> 21:49.320
MASTER: Ah! Ah!

21:49.360 --> 21:51.320
Come in.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.680
Come in!

21:54.040 --> 21:56.000
No, don't...don't worry
about her.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.840
She's fully under my control.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.560
Congratulations.

22:02.600 --> 22:03.960
You have managed something

22:04.000 --> 22:06.280
no other Cyberman
ever achieved,

22:06.320 --> 22:09.600
maybe - maybe -
even dreamed of!

22:09.640 --> 22:12.560
Gallifrey is yours.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.400
Offered as a gift.

22:18.080 --> 22:20.440
From an admiring Master.

22:22.040 --> 22:24.800
I know our races
have been enemies.

22:24.840 --> 22:26.960
I lived through
the Great Cyber War.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
I saw the atrocities
perpetrated on your race.

22:30.040 --> 22:32.240
I want to help put that right.
(SNIFFS)

22:32.280 --> 22:34.000
Why?

22:34.040 --> 22:36.400
I fear we have
a common interest.

22:38.160 --> 22:42.960
The New CyberArmy
shall have one goal -

22:43.000 --> 22:46.480
the destruction
of all organic life.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.960
Ah! So that's your thinking.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.760
But how are you going
to manage that?

22:52.800 --> 22:55.320
The Death Particle.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.160
One particle, when activated,

22:59.200 --> 23:03.560
capable of destroying
all organic life.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.280
Very nice!

23:05.320 --> 23:06.640
Ooh!

23:06.680 --> 23:08.800
(PULSATES)

23:08.840 --> 23:10.320
Did you make that?

23:10.360 --> 23:12.880
The Cyberium created it.

23:14.880 --> 23:17.080
Through me.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.960
So you're the host...

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
...for all Cyber knowledge
and strategy.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.920
Oh. Interesting.

23:26.960 --> 23:30.360
Now, I hate to point out
the flaw in your plan -

23:30.400 --> 23:33.360
Cybermen are part organic,

23:33.400 --> 23:35.640
but you more than most.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.760
My new Cyberwarriors

23:37.800 --> 23:41.880
are purged
of organic components.

23:41.920 --> 23:45.040
We shall rise towards
full automation,

23:45.080 --> 23:48.480
driven by the intelligence
of the Cyberium.

23:51.800 --> 23:54.120
And when that work is done...

23:55.360 --> 24:01.600
...I shall join my warriors
and make the final ascension

24:01.640 --> 24:04.640
to full mechanisation!

24:04.680 --> 24:06.640
Oh, you mean robots.

24:08.120 --> 24:09.680
You'll be robots.

24:11.840 --> 24:15.440
We shall be dominant.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.080
But robots.

24:17.120 --> 24:20.400
Oof. I'm a bit disappointed.

24:20.440 --> 24:21.600
I see how you got there -

24:21.640 --> 24:23.880
an AI wanting to create
more things in its own image -

24:23.920 --> 24:25.120
but it lacks vision.

24:25.160 --> 24:27.720
Right, what if we, um,
workshop this?

24:27.760 --> 24:29.440
You know, kick it around a bit?

24:29.480 --> 24:31.000
I have notes.

24:31.040 --> 24:34.640
You question the strategy
of the Cyberium?

24:34.680 --> 24:38.200
I do. I mean, it's good,
but it's not great.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.400
There's loads of robots.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.440
Throw a stick in this universe,
you'll hit a robot.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.040
I used to do that.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.760
Any idiot can make themselves
into a robot.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.200
It's not special.

24:49.600 --> 24:50.680
(WHIRRING)

24:50.720 --> 24:51.720
But if you want to be

24:51.760 --> 24:53.840
the dominant force
in the universe...

24:56.440 --> 24:57.840
...I can facilitate that.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.000
(GROANS)

25:04.040 --> 25:06.000
Explain.

25:06.040 --> 25:09.280
How fast are the conversion
processes on your ship?

25:09.320 --> 25:12.520
They have been restored
to optimal efficiency.

25:12.560 --> 25:16.080
(GROANS) Good. Good, good.
Good.

25:16.120 --> 25:18.520
Good!

25:18.560 --> 25:21.000
Cos I burned this citadel,

25:21.040 --> 25:23.880
but if I have one weakness,
it's that I am...

25:23.920 --> 25:25.560
...a bit of a hoarder.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.120
Let me show you.

25:27.160 --> 25:28.240
(GRUNTS)

25:29.320 --> 25:32.840
She's waking up in that Matrix.
But don't worry,

25:32.880 --> 25:35.240
my consciousness
can deal with her.

25:35.280 --> 25:38.600
I'm that good -
I can be in two places at once.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.120
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

25:44.280 --> 25:46.560
Now, having seen
her adopted child

25:46.600 --> 25:48.200
regenerate her body,

25:48.240 --> 25:51.400
Tecteun,
a scientist and explorer,

25:51.440 --> 25:54.160
had a new landscape to explore.

25:56.480 --> 25:59.600
She dedicated her life
to studying her child.

26:00.920 --> 26:04.120
Detailed every fragment
of genetic material.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.400
It took her years...

26:06.920 --> 26:09.320
...several of the child's
regenerations.

26:23.920 --> 26:25.640
Tecteun grew older.

26:25.680 --> 26:29.440
Her desire to understand
became an obsession.

26:29.480 --> 26:33.920
She worked tirelessly
endlessly, furiously.

26:33.960 --> 26:38.520
She had to crack this code
to understand regeneration.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.080
And finally...

26:42.600 --> 26:43.880
...she did.

26:45.520 --> 26:49.840
And to prove herself right,
she took the ultimate risk.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.400
Tested the theory on herself.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.560
Put her own life on the line.

26:58.600 --> 27:00.600
(GRUNTS)

27:00.640 --> 27:03.200
(BUZZING)

27:06.040 --> 27:07.680
Spliced into herself

27:07.720 --> 27:10.400
the genetic ability
to regenerate.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.480
I didn't know any of this.

27:18.520 --> 27:19.760
Did you know any of this?

27:22.480 --> 27:24.320
(SIGHS) Nearly there.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.640
The planet of Gallifrey
evolved.

27:28.680 --> 27:31.920
Shobogans grew
in knowledge and ability.

27:31.960 --> 27:35.160
They built themselves
a citadel.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.280
They discovered the ability
to travel through time

27:37.320 --> 27:38.760
as well as space.

27:40.040 --> 27:45.160
With Tecteun, they became
a self-appointed ruling elite.

27:45.200 --> 27:48.000
And Tecteun proposed

27:48.040 --> 27:51.160
that he gene-splice
the ability to regenerate

27:51.200 --> 27:54.920
into future generations
of citadel dwellers.

27:54.960 --> 27:57.640
It would become
the genetic inheritance of them

27:57.680 --> 27:59.840
and their descendants.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.640
But he would restrict
the regenerative process

28:02.680 --> 28:04.840
to a maximum of 12 times.

28:04.880 --> 28:08.240
The timeless child became
the base genetic code

28:08.280 --> 28:11.280
for all Gallifreyans
within the citadel.

28:11.320 --> 28:13.920
The civilisation
which renamed themselves -

28:13.960 --> 28:17.000
with characteristic pomposity -

28:17.040 --> 28:19.200
Time Lords.

28:20.960 --> 28:24.640
The foundling
had become the founder.

28:30.600 --> 28:34.040
The rest, as they say,
is history.

28:35.520 --> 28:38.000
What happened to the child?

28:41.280 --> 28:43.440
(CHUCKLES)

28:43.480 --> 28:44.840
What?

28:46.080 --> 28:47.560
What's so funny?

28:48.880 --> 28:51.720
What happened to the child?

28:52.800 --> 28:54.320
Oh, Doctor, really?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.760
Haven't you
worked this out yet?

29:04.520 --> 29:05.640
The child is you.

29:08.760 --> 29:10.560
(INHALES SHARPLY)

29:13.000 --> 29:15.600
You are the timeless child.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.200
(BREATH QUICKENS)

29:18.240 --> 29:19.800
No.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.240
No, I'm not.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.080
You always have been.

29:24.120 --> 29:26.560
I can't be.

29:28.040 --> 29:30.200

KO SHARMUS: Come on, come on!
Hurry, hurry!

29:38.720 --> 29:41.680
- This place is like a maze.
- I made it that way.

29:41.720 --> 29:44.040
In case of an eventuality
like this.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.920
Hey, you never think of doors?

29:45.960 --> 29:47.320
Big lockable doors.

29:47.360 --> 29:48.840
Indestructible doors.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.080
Dream of them every night!

29:50.120 --> 29:51.520
But I had to work
with what I had.

29:51.560 --> 29:53.320
Now...

29:53.360 --> 29:56.120
Hide well,
take what shots you can.

29:56.160 --> 29:58.440
Kill them before they kill you.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.600
Go!

30:05.560 --> 30:08.440
Three human life forms
detected.

30:19.800 --> 30:22.400

30:32.480 --> 30:34.480
- (KNOCKING)
- Hello.

30:35.680 --> 30:37.080
Too many of them.

30:42.360 --> 30:46.120
- One human located.
- No! No...

30:46.160 --> 30:48.480
(HEAVY FOOTSTEPS)

30:48.520 --> 30:51.600
All humans will be executed.

- Oh, my saints...

31:03.640 --> 31:05.680
BOTH: Where's Ethan?

31:05.720 --> 31:08.120
CYBERWARRIOR: Attention,
remaining humans.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.240
We have your friend.

31:09.280 --> 31:11.960
You have ten seconds
to surrender

31:12.000 --> 31:14.040
or he will be executed.

31:14.080 --> 31:16.400
- Don't come for me. Argh!
- Ten...

31:16.440 --> 31:19.120
He's two pathways away.
This way.

31:19.160 --> 31:20.240
Hey! We're coming!
We surrender!

31:20.280 --> 31:22.080
- Stop!
- Five, four...

31:22.120 --> 31:23.960
- I said we surrender!
- ...three...

31:24.000 --> 31:25.840
- We surrender!
- ...two, one...

31:25.880 --> 31:27.120
- No!

(METAL RATTLES)

31:37.600 --> 31:38.800
I don't understand.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.880
How about now?

31:51.320 --> 31:52.360
GRAHAM: Uh, Yaz,

31:52.400 --> 31:53.960
I can't...can't
get this hat off.

31:57.200 --> 31:58.480
MASTER: Wow...

31:58.520 --> 32:00.320
Wow.

32:00.360 --> 32:02.880
Wow, wow, wow, wow!

32:02.920 --> 32:06.600
Ah!
You have got a lot of these!

32:08.040 --> 32:10.720
A whole Cybercarrier worth.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.880
Perfect.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.320
So, what's your plan now?

32:19.360 --> 32:22.520
The Cyberium will process

32:22.560 --> 32:24.920
and dictate the strategy.

32:24.960 --> 32:26.440
The Cyberium?

32:27.800 --> 32:30.800
I've heard a lot about that
over the millennia.

32:30.840 --> 32:33.520
The heart of all your power.

32:35.240 --> 32:38.520
The centre
of all Cyber knowledge.

32:39.880 --> 32:41.200
(EXHALES)

32:44.200 --> 32:47.920
Oh, come on, Cyberium,
show us some leg.

32:47.960 --> 32:49.720
What do you actually
look like, hmm?

32:49.760 --> 32:52.320
It will not leave me...

32:52.360 --> 32:54.560
...while I live.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.000
Oh.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.640
OK.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.440
(GASPS)

33:14.480 --> 33:17.040
Well, aren't you pretty?

33:17.080 --> 33:19.080
And fast.

33:19.120 --> 33:21.480
You made your exit
very swiftly there.

33:21.520 --> 33:22.600
Worried, were you?

33:35.280 --> 33:36.920
I thought if he was compressed,

33:36.960 --> 33:39.360
the Death Particle
would activate...

33:40.560 --> 33:42.000
(SIGHS)

33:42.040 --> 33:43.440
...and all this would be over.

33:45.320 --> 33:46.720
I would've been OK with that.

33:49.280 --> 33:52.240
I thought it was a nice little
gamble, but no. (GROANS)

33:52.280 --> 33:53.480
Here we are.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.400
All still alive.

33:58.800 --> 34:04.640
And one miniaturised
Death Particle still in him,

34:04.680 --> 34:06.240
waiting for its moment...

34:07.600 --> 34:11.320
...for its chamber
to be smashed open.

34:11.360 --> 34:15.200
Prrrksh!

34:15.240 --> 34:16.920
Oh! (SNAPS)

34:16.960 --> 34:18.240
Shoot!

34:18.280 --> 34:21.360
I should've said, "Somebody
needs to cut you down to size",

34:21.400 --> 34:22.800
then zapped you.

34:22.840 --> 34:25.120
(GIGGLES)
I was just so trigger-happy.

34:25.160 --> 34:27.920
(SIGHS) I'll use it next time.

34:27.960 --> 34:30.120
Sit there for a mo.

34:30.160 --> 34:32.120
Oh, sorry, were you close?

34:33.680 --> 34:35.160
Candidly,

34:35.200 --> 34:36.960
I think you can do better.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.080
I request an alliance.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.840
I deserve to be
your business partner

34:41.880 --> 34:44.440
because I have performed well
in all the tasks.

34:44.480 --> 34:49.200
I ransacked the Matrix
of the Time Lords,

34:49.240 --> 34:52.840
distilled all the knowledge,
all the experiences,

34:52.880 --> 34:54.600
all the discoveries,

34:54.640 --> 34:56.760
into these brains up here.

34:56.800 --> 35:01.160
All the Cyber knowledge,
all the Time Lord knowledge...

35:01.200 --> 35:03.640
(LAUGHS) Put it together,
what do you get?

35:05.360 --> 35:07.760
Absolute supremacy
in the universe.

35:09.400 --> 35:10.480
Choose me.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.440
Oh, wow!

35:12.480 --> 35:14.680
That was quick! (CACKLES)

35:14.720 --> 35:16.320
Wa-ha-ha! Whoa!

35:16.360 --> 35:18.120
Woohoo!

35:18.160 --> 35:21.880
At least buy me...dinner!
(SHRIEKS)

35:23.680 --> 35:25.400
(ECHOING LAUGHTER)

35:27.200 --> 35:29.160
MASTER: This is no time
to be sleeping.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.680
Is it hurting, Doctor?

35:34.720 --> 35:38.240
I hope it's hurting,
because it really hurt me.

35:40.040 --> 35:41.160
It's all lies.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.000
None of this is the truth.

35:45.040 --> 35:46.800
For the first time in my lives,

35:46.840 --> 35:50.480
I can honestly say
every word is true.

35:50.520 --> 35:51.520
I know my life.

35:54.440 --> 35:55.880
I know...

35:55.920 --> 35:57.640
I know who I am.

35:57.680 --> 36:00.000
No, you don't. You never have.

36:00.040 --> 36:03.320
Your life has been hidden
from you.

36:03.360 --> 36:06.120
Our founding parents
wanted a noble creation myth

36:06.160 --> 36:07.360
for the Time Lords.

36:08.520 --> 36:09.680
Born to rule?

36:09.720 --> 36:10.920
I remember my home.

36:12.600 --> 36:13.920
I remember growing up.

36:13.960 --> 36:16.640
I remember you and me
at the Academy together.

36:16.680 --> 36:18.280
That happened.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.880
It just wasn't your first life.

36:19.920 --> 36:21.680
Why would they lie?!

36:23.560 --> 36:24.920
Why would they do that?

36:26.200 --> 36:29.040
I wish it wasn't true,
but it is.

36:31.480 --> 36:33.480
You know what I find
the most infuriating?

36:34.600 --> 36:36.640
You always behaved
like you were different,

36:36.680 --> 36:38.560
like you were...
like you were special.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.480
And you were.

36:44.240 --> 36:45.560
You can see...

36:45.600 --> 36:47.560
You can see why I'm angry.

36:47.600 --> 36:50.000
(STAMMERS)
A little piece of you is in me.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.040
All I am is somehow
because of you,

36:53.080 --> 36:56.040
and believe me when I say,
I cannot bear that!

36:58.880 --> 37:00.320
Show me the rest.

37:01.360 --> 37:02.920
I'm not sure you can cope
with much...

37:02.960 --> 37:05.200
Show me the rest!

37:06.440 --> 37:09.160
I have a right
to know my own life.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.880
(LAUGHS)

37:14.280 --> 37:16.120
All right.

37:16.160 --> 37:18.880
But I'm not sure
it's going to make you happy.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.520
The policy of the Time Lords
is clear -

37:23.560 --> 37:27.400
strict non-intervention
in other worlds and times.

37:32.520 --> 37:33.960
However...

37:35.320 --> 37:39.360
Policy and reality
sometimes diverge.

37:40.840 --> 37:43.560
There are times when
it is necessary to intervene.

37:44.960 --> 37:47.440
That is the purpose
of The Division.

37:49.240 --> 37:51.000
The tests we set you...

37:53.400 --> 37:55.680
These results are the best
I've ever seen.

37:55.720 --> 38:00.200
Those images.
Island. I've seen them...

38:00.240 --> 38:01.800
...in my head.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.760
What are they?

38:03.800 --> 38:05.560
Sh-sh-sh-sh.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.320
She's talking.

38:07.360 --> 38:10.440
The Division does not exist.

38:11.520 --> 38:14.640
The Division does not
have operatives.

38:14.680 --> 38:17.720
We are not even here.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.040
Do you understand?

38:22.840 --> 38:24.960
I propose...

38:27.560 --> 38:28.800
What have you done?

38:28.840 --> 38:30.320
Not me.

38:30.360 --> 38:32.240
That was done
long before I got here.

38:33.880 --> 38:38.080
Everything from here
is redacted, blocked out,

38:38.120 --> 38:39.760
all but erased.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.440
There was something here.

38:43.480 --> 38:44.800
A lot of stuff, seemingly,

38:44.840 --> 38:46.800
but now it all
just looks like this.

38:46.840 --> 38:50.240
I tried everything,
everything, to decode it,

38:50.280 --> 38:54.360
but it's...it's unrecoverable,
beyond even my brilliance.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.720
And it's not often I say that.
(CHUCKLES)

38:58.120 --> 38:59.560
But it's my life.

39:02.520 --> 39:04.480
Yeah.

39:04.520 --> 39:07.200
How much was lost?

39:07.240 --> 39:09.720
Impossible to tell.

39:09.760 --> 39:12.320
It took up a lot of space
in the Matrix, though.

39:12.360 --> 39:14.520
Yeah.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.080
There is one final trace.

39:16.120 --> 39:20.480
Those glitches of island
you keep seeing.

39:20.520 --> 39:24.320
Those images, they were buried
deep in the Matrix.

39:24.360 --> 39:26.200
Tecteun put
a visual filter over it

39:26.240 --> 39:30.000
so that no-one who watched it
would find it remarkable.

39:30.040 --> 39:31.200
(YELPS)

39:31.240 --> 39:32.640
I transmitted them
into your mind

39:32.680 --> 39:34.360
as you tracked the Cybermen.

39:35.400 --> 39:38.560
Maybe this is
the last gift of a parent.

39:38.600 --> 39:40.280
A clue.

39:41.320 --> 39:42.640
Or an apology.

39:45.240 --> 39:46.440
You can decide.

39:46.480 --> 39:51.080
Did Tecteun leave these images
for you to decode one day?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.800
We have to get rid
of everything, I'm afraid.

39:56.840 --> 39:58.760
Thank you for your service.

40:00.480 --> 40:02.920
We're sorry
you won't remember it.

(SHRIEKING)

40:06.800 --> 40:08.080

40:23.360 --> 40:25.440
What did they do to you,
Doctor?

40:25.480 --> 40:27.320
How many lives have you had?

40:27.360 --> 40:28.360
Wake up.

40:28.400 --> 40:30.160
(GASPS)

40:40.480 --> 40:43.640
I know you're broken,
but it's all over now.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.120
What do you mean?

40:47.400 --> 40:50.480
When I said
I killed everyone here...

40:52.680 --> 40:54.760
...I did keep the bodies.

40:56.200 --> 40:58.920
Just...just cold enough
in case they'd be useful.

40:58.960 --> 41:01.040
I thought...I thought maybe
some good can come

41:01.080 --> 41:03.040
out of all of this.

41:04.680 --> 41:08.200
Your adopted mother isn't the
only one who can experiment.

41:08.240 --> 41:09.760
I mean, what if...

41:11.160 --> 41:14.080
...a new race could be created?

41:14.120 --> 41:16.080
Huh?

41:17.160 --> 41:18.640
(EXHALES EXCITEDLY)

41:23.160 --> 41:26.840
Time Lord organics
with the ability to regenerate

41:26.880 --> 41:31.040
and self-repair
in Cyber armour!

41:32.120 --> 41:34.400
Invincible!

41:34.440 --> 41:37.040

41:37.080 --> 41:38.240
Right?!

41:38.280 --> 41:39.920
(LAUGHS EXUBERANTLY)

41:39.960 --> 41:41.760
Oh, come in, my pretties.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.200
Yeah!

41:44.320 --> 41:48.000
Doosh, doosh, doosh!

41:51.800 --> 41:55.520
Line up. Attention!
Yeah, that's it.

41:55.560 --> 41:57.160
(LAUGHS)

41:57.200 --> 41:58.440
Grr!

41:58.480 --> 42:00.600
Well, let's test it out.

42:05.360 --> 42:07.080
Shoot him.

42:07.120 --> 42:08.600
Shoot him!

42:11.520 --> 42:12.840
Good dog.

42:15.680 --> 42:16.920
All dead.

42:16.960 --> 42:17.960
Um...

42:21.000 --> 42:22.480
Wait.

42:22.520 --> 42:23.800
Could it be?

42:25.960 --> 42:30.920
Yes, it could!
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

42:37.080 --> 42:39.840

42:41.680 --> 42:43.200
(YELLS)

42:43.240 --> 42:47.640
Behold your new CyberMasters,
Doctor.

42:47.680 --> 42:49.960
All born from you!

42:50.000 --> 42:52.880
But led by me.

42:52.920 --> 42:54.320
How does that feel?

42:56.040 --> 42:57.400
Huh?

42:59.240 --> 43:00.960
Now, no time to lose.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.360
Don't move.
Oh, that's right, you can't.

43:03.400 --> 43:04.800
(LAUGHS)

43:04.840 --> 43:09.480
(SIGHS) Can you feel
a new era dawning, Doctor?

43:13.080 --> 43:15.360
- For Gallifrey.
- CYBERGUARDS: For Gallifrey!

43:15.400 --> 43:17.120
For the Time Lords.

43:17.160 --> 43:18.560
CYBERGUARDS:
For the Time Lords!

43:18.600 --> 43:21.840
For the end
of the universe itself!

43:21.880 --> 43:24.400
CYBERGUARDS: For the end
of the universe itself!

43:24.440 --> 43:25.920
Sweet dreams.

43:28.760 --> 43:30.760
This way, soldiers.

43:37.400 --> 43:39.520
RAVIO: The Boundary, it's real!

43:39.560 --> 43:42.080
RYAN: Yeah. And The Doctor's
on the other side.

43:46.320 --> 43:47.560
So, how do we do this?

43:47.600 --> 43:49.600
The Boundary will absorb us.

43:49.640 --> 43:51.520
But you have to take the step.

43:51.560 --> 43:53.520
Step into the unknown.

43:53.560 --> 43:55.560
Who fancies going first?

43:57.400 --> 43:58.720
Ah!

44:07.480 --> 44:08.840
This is Gallifrey.

44:10.560 --> 44:12.400
This is where
The Doctor's from.

44:14.760 --> 44:16.840
We're never going to find her
in this lot.

44:16.880 --> 44:17.880
Yeah, we are.

44:17.920 --> 44:19.800
We're going to find her
and we're going to rescue her.

44:19.840 --> 44:22.800
She's done it for us enough
times. Now it's our turn.

44:24.240 --> 44:26.480
This is going to be even more
dangerous from here.

44:26.520 --> 44:27.560
You don't have to come.

44:27.600 --> 44:29.080
We owe you.

44:30.320 --> 44:32.640
We're in. Right?

44:32.680 --> 44:34.000
Right.

44:34.040 --> 44:36.160
Great. How'm I meant
to contradict that,

44:36.200 --> 44:37.400
if you're going all heroic?

44:40.120 --> 44:41.560
You coming?

44:42.720 --> 44:45.280
I already lived
longer than I expected.

44:45.320 --> 44:47.960
There must be a few last things
I can blow up before I'm done.

45:04.040 --> 45:06.120
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

45:06.160 --> 45:07.680
Oh, great.

45:07.720 --> 45:08.840
(SIGHS)

45:10.800 --> 45:12.880
What are you doing here?

45:15.680 --> 45:18.480
Or are you the Matrix
playing more games with me?

45:18.520 --> 45:22.800
Don't ask me.
I'm as lost as you are in here.

45:22.840 --> 45:26.880
Maybe...you just summoned me.

45:26.920 --> 45:29.080
Where do you fit into all this?

45:30.880 --> 45:32.640
Were you me all that time ago?

45:34.240 --> 45:36.680
Were all my memories
of you erased?

45:38.640 --> 45:42.160
Did they force me back
into becoming a child?

45:46.320 --> 45:48.280
How many more of me
are out there?

45:48.320 --> 45:49.920
I don't have those answers.

45:51.040 --> 45:53.360
But say I did -

45:53.400 --> 45:55.080
would they even help?

45:58.160 --> 46:00.440
Of course they would.

46:00.480 --> 46:02.040
All this?

46:02.080 --> 46:03.720
It means I'm not
who I thought I was.

46:03.760 --> 46:05.880
Because your memories
aren't compatible

46:05.920 --> 46:07.560
with what you've learnt today?

46:07.600 --> 46:09.400
Yes.

46:09.440 --> 46:14.200
Have you ever been limited
by who you were before?

46:17.360 --> 46:18.680
Ah.

46:19.880 --> 46:22.120
Now, that does sound
like me talking.

46:27.600 --> 46:29.080
I'm so tired!

46:30.520 --> 46:34.280
The Matrix is sapping
all the energy of out of me.

46:34.320 --> 46:36.320
No time to be tired.

46:36.360 --> 46:38.120
Still work to do out there.

46:38.160 --> 46:39.800
Lives at stake.

46:39.840 --> 46:41.080
Armies being born.

46:42.280 --> 46:44.400
People need The Doctor.

46:52.120 --> 46:54.080
I don't know
how to stop The Master.

46:54.120 --> 46:55.840
Course you do.

46:59.160 --> 47:00.760
That one question

47:00.800 --> 47:02.880
that's nagging at you,

47:02.920 --> 47:06.760
the one thing he said
that you didn't understand.

47:06.800 --> 47:08.480
The one thing who said?

47:08.520 --> 47:10.120
The Master?

47:10.160 --> 47:11.080
No!

47:12.720 --> 47:14.480
Get out of here.

47:14.520 --> 47:16.760
I know this place
has blown your mind.

47:18.920 --> 47:21.200
Maybe you should return
the compliment.

47:25.280 --> 47:26.280
No, wait!

47:27.760 --> 47:29.400
Are you still there?

47:29.440 --> 47:31.280
Of course she's still there.

47:31.320 --> 47:33.800
If you were me,
you're buried within me,

47:33.840 --> 47:35.560
buried within him...

47:37.400 --> 47:38.800
Too many thoughts.

47:38.840 --> 47:41.080
All right, first things first,
what did she say?

47:42.360 --> 47:44.280
Mind blown.

47:44.320 --> 47:46.080
Yes! Of course.

47:48.200 --> 47:53.000
All this history,
all these lies,

47:53.040 --> 47:55.320
it's too much stimulus.

47:55.360 --> 47:57.160
It might work.

47:57.200 --> 48:00.080
I've fought the Matrix before,
denied its reality,

48:00.120 --> 48:02.280
I can do it again.

48:02.320 --> 48:03.320
Maybe.

48:03.360 --> 48:05.000
Well, you know what
they say, Doctor -

48:05.040 --> 48:06.560
nothing ventured,
nothing blown.

48:06.600 --> 48:07.680
Oh!

48:07.720 --> 48:09.400
I'm talking to myself again.
That's a good sign.

48:09.440 --> 48:10.800
Thanks, Doctor. Still here.

48:10.840 --> 48:12.400
No, shut up,
I need to concentrate.

48:12.440 --> 48:13.520
Uh...

48:16.400 --> 48:17.840
All right.

48:17.880 --> 48:19.520
Have a blast of this, Matrix.

48:57.360 --> 48:58.640
YAZ: Doctor!

49:00.520 --> 49:04.760
GRAHAM: Yaz, is she all right?
Doctor?

49:07.560 --> 49:09.160
Doctor, we're here for you.

49:18.800 --> 49:20.400
My fam.

49:20.440 --> 49:21.840
She's not dead, then.

49:23.840 --> 49:27.240
Who are they?
Are we having a party?

49:27.280 --> 49:28.280
Oh.

49:29.680 --> 49:31.280
All those memories.

49:31.320 --> 49:33.280
The Matrix.

49:33.320 --> 49:34.920
The memories blew the Matrix.

49:36.040 --> 49:37.680
Oh, she's clever.

49:37.720 --> 49:38.960
I'm clever.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.800
We're all clever.

49:40.840 --> 49:41.840
All of us.

49:43.200 --> 49:44.600
However many that is.

49:44.640 --> 49:46.240
All right, then.

49:47.360 --> 49:49.120
Off we go. Ugh!

49:49.160 --> 49:51.720
No, there's something
I'm missing.

49:54.680 --> 49:57.480
The Master is creating
a new race of Cybermen

49:57.520 --> 49:59.000
using Time Lord bodies.

50:00.160 --> 50:02.560
An endlessly regenerating army.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.680
I have to stop him.

50:04.720 --> 50:06.000
Fast.

50:06.040 --> 50:08.040
You shouldn't be here.

50:08.080 --> 50:09.680
- No humans on Gallifrey.
- If it helps,

50:09.720 --> 50:11.720
- we have explosives.
- And a plan.

50:11.760 --> 50:14.240
The Cyber ship's parked up
in the middle of your hometown,

50:14.280 --> 50:15.280
it's ripe for blowing up.

50:15.320 --> 50:17.960
We're going to strategically
place bombs around the ship,

50:18.000 --> 50:19.920
including some close enough
to the core.

50:19.960 --> 50:21.400
Yes. Good.

50:21.440 --> 50:22.640
Do that.

50:22.680 --> 50:24.000
But it won't achieve
everything.

50:24.040 --> 50:27.280
A race of CyberMasters -
can't let them off this planet,

50:27.320 --> 50:28.480
have to be stopped.

50:28.520 --> 50:30.200
And your bombs
aren't going to do that.

50:30.240 --> 50:32.160
We need more!
But there isn't anything more.

50:32.200 --> 50:33.800
The Master's seen to that.

50:34.840 --> 50:37.640
The Master's seen
to everything.

50:37.680 --> 50:39.360

50:39.400 --> 50:40.520

50:41.640 --> 50:42.960
That's what's been bugging me.

50:44.280 --> 50:46.160
That's the thing
that he said to me.

50:46.200 --> 50:47.480
What thing? Who said?

50:47.520 --> 50:49.400
The half-converted Cyberman.

50:49.440 --> 50:51.560
The death of everything...

50:52.840 --> 50:54.640
...is within me.

50:54.680 --> 50:56.880
That's what he said!

50:56.920 --> 50:59.320
Argh! But what did it mean?

50:59.360 --> 51:01.680
There is a myth around him.

51:01.720 --> 51:02.880
The Death Particle.

51:02.920 --> 51:05.920
The legend is -
he, it, whatever

51:05.960 --> 51:07.680
has a particle
in a tiny chamber

51:07.720 --> 51:09.160
inside its chest.

51:09.200 --> 51:12.680
It will take out
all organic life on a planet.

51:12.720 --> 51:15.080
- That's grim.
- Or it's a solution.

51:15.120 --> 51:19.440
A timer on an explosive
to activate the particle

51:19.480 --> 51:21.760
- and a clear evacuation plan.
- Only if you've got a way

51:21.800 --> 51:23.640
to get us off this planet
before it hits.

51:23.680 --> 51:25.960

those explosives?

51:26.000 --> 51:28.040
I'll deal with the rest.

51:28.080 --> 51:30.400
Meet in the corridor
below the carrier.

51:30.440 --> 51:32.280
Go on, then!

51:32.320 --> 51:35.040
Now, I need to get
a fix on The Master.

55:22.200 --> 55:23.320
On my home.

55:26.520 --> 55:29.600
On The Master
and his new breed of Cybermen.

55:29.640 --> 55:30.920
You sure you want to do that?

55:30.960 --> 55:32.520
I'm sure
I don't want to do that,

55:32.560 --> 55:34.000
but there's no alternative.

55:34.040 --> 55:36.360
If The Master and the Cybermen
get off this planet,

55:36.400 --> 55:37.880
they'll be unstoppable.

55:39.280 --> 55:42.640
I started this
with Shelley and the Cyberium,

55:42.680 --> 55:43.720
now I have to finish it.

55:46.520 --> 55:47.680
Alone.

55:47.720 --> 55:48.760
What?

55:50.280 --> 55:52.320
The TARDIS will take you
back to Earth.

55:52.360 --> 55:53.680
All of you.

55:53.720 --> 55:55.880
You can settle
in the 21st century.

55:55.920 --> 55:58.960
- You're not serious.
- Deadly.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.360
What about you?

56:01.400 --> 56:03.240
You detonate that thing,
you'll die too.

56:05.360 --> 56:06.640
That's the way it has to be.

56:10.480 --> 56:12.920
And I would do that
in a heartbeat

56:12.960 --> 56:14.440
for this universe.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
For you.

56:23.120 --> 56:24.400
My fam.

56:28.640 --> 56:30.560
We're not letting you go.

56:30.600 --> 56:32.600
- You're not doing this.
- Get off me, Yaz!

56:37.960 --> 56:38.960
Please.

56:44.920 --> 56:46.000
Yaz.

56:47.320 --> 56:48.440
Come on.

56:57.320 --> 56:58.440
Live great lives.

57:36.080 --> 57:38.800
I definitely said no plus ones.

57:38.840 --> 57:40.720
Well... Oh!

57:40.760 --> 57:43.080
Where I go, they go now.

57:43.120 --> 57:44.840
Are you going to have them
shoot me?

57:44.880 --> 57:45.960
No, Doctor.

57:47.000 --> 57:48.240
As of now,

57:48.280 --> 57:51.000
I wish my enemies
a long and healthy life,

57:51.040 --> 57:54.400
so they may witness
my many triumphs,

57:54.440 --> 57:56.760
because they will be legion.

57:58.280 --> 57:59.840
You're looking peaky.

57:59.880 --> 58:01.320
Oh, yeah!

58:02.720 --> 58:05.960
The Cyberium lives in me now,
Doctor.

58:08.080 --> 58:10.080
(CHUCKLES) Yes!

58:10.120 --> 58:12.040
See...

58:12.080 --> 58:13.400
(SHIVERS WITH EXCITEMENT)

58:13.440 --> 58:15.960
I've been looking forward
to seeing your face about that.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.800
I can feel it

58:18.840 --> 58:21.080
flowing around in me -

58:21.120 --> 58:24.800
the information, the strategy,

58:24.840 --> 58:26.480
the...the consciousness.

58:28.360 --> 58:29.640
It's a beautiful thing.

58:31.800 --> 58:33.680
And look at us.

58:34.920 --> 58:36.720
I have broken you

58:36.760 --> 58:39.280
and created a new race.

58:39.320 --> 58:40.320
And now...

58:41.680 --> 58:43.560
Well, now I shall conquer...

58:44.800 --> 58:46.360
...everything.

58:47.600 --> 58:49.000
Oh!

58:49.040 --> 58:51.920
You think you've broken me?

58:53.720 --> 58:56.000
You'll have to try
harder than that.

58:57.760 --> 58:59.920
You've given me a gift.

59:02.840 --> 59:04.240
Of myself.

59:08.680 --> 59:11.080
You think
that could destroy me?

59:11.120 --> 59:12.920
You think
that makes me lesser?

59:14.680 --> 59:17.280
It makes me more.

59:17.320 --> 59:21.720
I contain multitudes more
than I ever thought or knew.

59:21.760 --> 59:23.200
You want me to be scared of it

59:23.240 --> 59:25.320
because you're scared
of everything.

59:26.440 --> 59:29.160
But I am so much more than you.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.720
Wow.

59:34.760 --> 59:36.440
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

59:41.000 --> 59:42.720
So, why are we here?

59:47.160 --> 59:51.320
(GASPS) Oh, good, very good.

59:51.360 --> 59:53.120
That's why I left it for you.

59:53.160 --> 59:54.560
Wondered if you would...

59:58.920 --> 1:00:00.880
...take out me.

1:00:00.920 --> 1:00:03.440
Take out these life forms.

1:00:03.480 --> 1:00:06.120
All those bodies
still in the vaults.

1:00:06.160 --> 1:00:10.320
Every organic cellular
life form on this planet...

1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:11.520
...forever.

1:00:12.960 --> 1:00:14.640
And yourself.

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:18.480
Do that, would you?

1:00:20.600 --> 1:00:21.760
Yes.

1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:24.040
This time...

1:00:25.040 --> 1:00:26.320
...yes.

1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:27.760
Go on, then.

1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:33.400
You were the start of
all of this, now finish it.

1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:35.480
Come on, come on.

1:00:35.520 --> 1:00:36.920
Come on!

1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:39.520
Come on, come on!

1:00:39.560 --> 1:00:41.720
What have you got left anyway?

1:00:41.760 --> 1:00:44.160
You don't even know
your own life.

1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:47.160
Look how low
I have brought you.

1:00:49.160 --> 1:00:51.520
I have won, Doctor.

1:00:51.560 --> 1:00:55.480
You may have made me,
but I have destroyed you.

1:00:58.200 --> 1:01:00.040
Become death.

1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:04.440
Become me.

1:01:06.400 --> 1:01:08.040
Come on.

1:01:08.080 --> 1:01:09.800
Come on, come on.

1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:21.680
For just a moment there,
I thought maybe.

1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:25.240
Argh! (EXHALES DISMISSIVELY)

1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:27.600
Oh, Doctor.

1:01:27.640 --> 1:01:30.280
The universe will suffer
for your weakness,

1:01:30.320 --> 1:01:31.560
I'll make sure of it.

1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:33.200
KO SHARMUS: Not if
I have anything to do with it.

1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:36.240
Excuse me?

1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:37.640
No gate-crashers.

1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:39.800
You can't still be here,
I set the controls.

1:01:39.840 --> 1:01:40.880
I followed you out.

1:01:40.920 --> 1:01:42.000
They tried to stop me,

1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:45.480
but I wanted to be sure
that these things are gone.

1:01:45.520 --> 1:01:48.320
- And now I can be.
- No.

1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:49.520
(CHUCKLES)

1:01:49.560 --> 1:01:51.920
You didn't start this. I did.

1:01:51.960 --> 1:01:55.160
I was part of a resistance unit
that sent the Cyberium

1:01:55.200 --> 1:01:56.480
back through time and space.

1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:58.920
Though, obviously, we didn't
send it back far enough.

1:02:00.280 --> 1:02:03.240
So this is my penance.

1:02:03.280 --> 1:02:06.200
Mine to finish.

1:02:08.560 --> 1:02:10.680
My journey ends here.

1:02:12.200 --> 1:02:14.640
But the universe
still needs you.

1:02:16.240 --> 1:02:18.520
So I suggest you run.

1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:20.760
- But...
- Run, Doctor!

1:02:22.040 --> 1:02:23.640
MASTER: Don't you dare.

1:02:24.680 --> 1:02:26.240
Doctor!

1:02:26.280 --> 1:02:28.760
Still feeling confident?

1:02:31.800 --> 1:02:32.880
(SONIC BUZZES)

1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:34.000
(WHIRRING)

1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:37.440
(TARDIS POWERS UP)

1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:41.000
Kill him.

1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:42.640
Killed you first.

1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:46.480
(GROANS)

1:02:48.040 --> 1:02:50.520
MASTER: All of you,
through here - now!

1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:03.960
(VWORP! VWORP!)

1:03:11.680 --> 1:03:13.200
This is Earth.

1:03:17.080 --> 1:03:18.440
(EXHALES)

1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:21.600
We're on Earth.

1:03:21.640 --> 1:03:23.520
We're home.

1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:27.480
She got us home.

1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:34.680
But what happens to her?

1:03:41.640 --> 1:03:43.400
Oh, yeah, nice.

1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:45.160
Good chameleon circuit.

1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:47.240
I'm going to have to
leave you there, though.

1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:53.000
I can think of worse places
to spend eternity.

1:03:58.400 --> 1:04:00.440
(POWERS UP)

1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:02.040
Hello, mate.

1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:05.080
(TARDIS BEEPS)

1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:08.720
Thanks.

1:04:08.760 --> 1:04:09.920
Home sweet home.

1:04:09.960 --> 1:04:11.960
(TARDIS WARBLES)

1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:13.520
We got a lift back another way.

1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:14.760
(TARDIS BEEPS)

1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:16.320
Don't get jealous.

1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:17.400
I'll pick them up now.

1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:21.520
Maybe just need a moment.

1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:26.040
(TARDIS BEEPS)

1:04:35.160 --> 1:04:37.040
(ALARM BLARES)

1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:40.600
What?

1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:42.760
Judoon Cold Case Unit.

1:04:42.800 --> 1:04:44.640
Fugitive - The Doctor.

1:04:44.680 --> 1:04:47.400
Sentence -
whole of life imprisonment,

1:04:47.440 --> 1:04:49.680
maximum security facility.

1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:55.640
What?

1:05:03.320 --> 1:05:04.920
What?!
