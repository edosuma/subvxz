(sighing and panting)

01:10.362 --> 01:12.489
Oh, you're so weird, Roman.

01:12.531 --> 01:14.825
- But I like it.
- Shh!

01:14.867 --> 01:16.493
You don't know my name.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.829
Oh! Sorry.

01:25.126 --> 01:27.462
You didn't like that?

01:27.504 --> 01:30.758
Oh, no, baby. It's <i>tr?s</i> kinky.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.938
This is too much.

01:43.979 --> 01:46.314
You know my name?

01:46.356 --> 01:49.109
You're the kid
in the candy store.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.486
(He chuckles.)

01:51.528 --> 01:54.531
This is the part
where you leave.

02:06.877 --> 02:09.088
(girl): <i>OK, girls!</i>
<i>Are we ready?</i>

02:09.128 --> 02:11.090
(little girls): <i>Yeah!</i>

02:11.131 --> 02:15.886
And go! One, two, three,
four, five, six,

02:15.928 --> 02:19.014
jump, seven, eight!
Go one, two... strong arms!...

02:19.056 --> 02:22.350
three, four, five, six,
jump, seven, eight!

02:22.392 --> 02:28.315
Go one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, jump!

02:28.356 --> 02:33.445
Go one, two, three, four, five,
six... last jump... seven, eight!

02:33.487 --> 02:35.656
Woo! (Laughing)

02:45.332 --> 02:48.836
So, particle physics.
What does that mean?

02:48.877 --> 02:52.213
In essence, we are starting with
Einstein's theory of relativity,

02:52.255 --> 02:56.259
we're moving on to the Big Bang
theory, and then it goes right back

02:56.301 --> 02:58.595
to what I said before...
particles.

02:58.637 --> 03:01.932
So, it means the particles of the largest
structure are equal to the particles

03:01.974 --> 03:05.519
of the smallest structure.
Any questions?

03:10.231 --> 03:12.985
- Ms. Bluebell.
- This was

03:13.027 --> 03:16.237
not as "accessible"
to lay readers as you said.

03:16.279 --> 03:19.198
I believe what I said was
MORE accessible to lay readers.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.409
And if you think that's
not true, I'd be happy

03:21.451 --> 03:25.246
to lend you my master's thesis.
You didn't like it.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.332
I loved it.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.501
There's just...

03:29.543 --> 03:32.838
so much more happening
than what you think you see.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.675
Well, why don't you keep it?

03:36.717 --> 03:39.678
Really?

03:39.720 --> 03:42.222
I insist. Here.

03:55.194 --> 03:58.197
(rail road crossing bell)

04:03.869 --> 04:05.829
(cell phone notification)

04:05.871 --> 04:08.082
(train horn)

04:11.001 --> 04:14.546
(train horn)

04:32.856 --> 04:36.735
(screaming)

04:50.373 --> 04:52.459
Ah!

05:10.435 --> 05:13.272
(rustling nearby) Ah!

05:27.828 --> 05:30.789
(panicked breathing)

05:30.831 --> 05:33.834
(bumping and shuffling)

05:41.800 --> 05:43.802
(shuffling)

05:48.598 --> 05:51.018
(loud thud) Ah! Ah!

05:51.059 --> 05:52.978
Ah! Ah!

05:53.020 --> 05:55.981
(flesh tearing)

05:58.608 --> 06:02.029
(flesh tearing) (screaming)

06:02.070 --> 06:07.117
(ringing)

06:07.159 --> 06:10.162
(girl screaming in agony)

06:19.296 --> 06:21.673
(flesh tearing)

06:24.968 --> 06:27.971
♪♪♪

07:19.106 --> 07:21.066
Is there a house?

07:21.108 --> 07:22.859
I think it's half a house.

07:22.901 --> 07:24.485
Uhhuh.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.489
It's home sweet home!

07:30.491 --> 07:34.704
Ah, let's get, uh, cozy. OK.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.473
(train horn in the distance)

07:53.514 --> 07:56.435
(dog barking in the area)

07:56.476 --> 07:59.146
Hello, neighbor.

08:02.023 --> 08:05.026
(train horn in the distance)

08:19.374 --> 08:21.918
Oh, man. Vince.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.338
He was sad when he was sober.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.131
Vince was sober?

08:26.173 --> 08:28.549
Yeah, when it counted.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.015
(softly): Ah, we're in business.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.018
Oh.

08:38.058 --> 08:40.270
- I'm gonna go for a walk.
- OK.

08:40.312 --> 08:42.730
- Go to town.
- Yeah. Hang those herbs up,

08:42.772 --> 08:45.484
though, before you go.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.236
Oh, man.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.781
Oh, this is just...

08:51.823 --> 08:54.409
Oh, baby.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.753
Bye, Mom!

09:05.795 --> 09:08.298
(dog barking)

09:43.458 --> 09:46.253
Perfect timing.

09:46.294 --> 09:50.507
- You're mommy's little thief.
- Huh? Where's the, uh... - Oh, yeah.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.592
- ...the thing?
- I put all of our tools

09:52.633 --> 09:54.594
in here, OK?

09:54.635 --> 09:57.556
You didn't need my help at all
to clean up this place.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.682
Oh, I cleaned!

09:59.724 --> 10:01.684
Looks pretty nice.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.229
(train horn in the distance)
(She sighs.)

10:04.271 --> 10:06.856
(dog barking in the area)

10:11.069 --> 10:14.239
You know what they say
about pearls before swine?

10:14.281 --> 10:15.949
Uh... no.

10:15.990 --> 10:19.494
Ah, well, I'll tell ya later.
I cooked pork chops but...

10:19.536 --> 10:21.496
it's OK.

10:23.498 --> 10:26.042
OK. (Pouring)

10:26.084 --> 10:28.086
To our new home.

10:30.505 --> 10:33.716
(speaking a foreign language)

10:53.736 --> 10:55.696
(snake shrieking)

11:01.369 --> 11:04.038
Ah!<i>Mil truj!</i>

11:04.080 --> 11:07.417
You're a gypsy.

11:07.459 --> 11:10.420
- And you're a stalker.
- I've seen you swimming

11:10.462 --> 11:12.464
in my grandparents' pond.

11:14.924 --> 11:18.178
- So you've seen me naked.
- I don't care.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.305
It's just that I'm a novelist,
so it's important to me

11:20.347 --> 11:22.932
to understand people's
motivations.

11:22.974 --> 11:25.810
You're a novelist, huh?

11:25.852 --> 11:28.605
- Impressive.
- Why swim in their pond

11:28.647 --> 11:30.815
when the river's right there?

11:30.857 --> 11:33.692
'Cause the river's polluted
as balls.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.987
And to get your facts straight,

11:36.029 --> 11:39.907
I'm only a half-breed...
technically.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.785
My grandfather, Nicolai,
he was full Kalderash Roma

11:42.827 --> 11:47.374
from the Carpathians, but... he came to
the States and he married <i>gadje</i> woman.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.042
What does any of that mean?

11:49.083 --> 11:52.795
It means us Rumanceks will
forever ride the earth

11:52.837 --> 11:55.465
on two horses
with only one ass.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.093
You want a beer?

11:59.135 --> 12:01.137
Beer kills brain cells.

12:01.179 --> 12:04.932
Ah. Some of us have extra,
then.

12:04.974 --> 12:08.102
Well, then the guy who used
to live here must have been...

12:08.144 --> 12:10.771
a rocket scientist.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.940
What happened to him?

12:12.982 --> 12:18.488
Vince, my uncle, died
of alcohol poisoning.

12:35.838 --> 12:38.299
Do you worship the devil?

12:41.511 --> 12:44.055
Do we worship the devil,
she says.

12:46.057 --> 12:50.144
Each point represents
an element,

12:50.186 --> 12:53.147
the topmost being the soul.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.816
Plus, it looks fuckin' metal.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.240
What?

13:02.282 --> 13:04.618
Are you a werewolf?

13:04.659 --> 13:07.995
Now we know who your literary
influences are.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.498
You gonna find me a vampire
to have a sexless

13:10.540 --> 13:13.000
- three-way with?
- Gross.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.086
But your index and middle
fingers are the same length.

13:15.128 --> 13:18.131
And they say that makes you
a werewolf.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.218
Jesus.

13:22.260 --> 13:25.930
Where did you get
something like that?

13:25.972 --> 13:28.475
I don't know. TV or whatever.

13:28.516 --> 13:31.686
So, are you a werewolf,
or what?

13:34.522 --> 13:36.232
Sure.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.109
Are you a retard?

13:38.151 --> 13:40.111
No.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.781
My heightened werewolf senses
indicate otherwise.

13:42.821 --> 13:45.199
I don't think you're supposed
to use that word.

13:45.241 --> 13:49.120
Yeah. "Werewolf" is
pretty racist.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.122
I prefer "sexy man-beast".

13:51.164 --> 13:54.459
Again, gross. I mean "retard".

13:54.501 --> 13:56.043
I know what you meant.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.963
(Police siren bleeps.)

14:07.972 --> 14:10.475
- That's Tom.
- Tom?

14:10.517 --> 14:12.851
He's my friend's dad.
He's cool.

14:12.893 --> 14:16.481
- I go to school with his kids...
- No. Ha. Know when to say when.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.232
You're weird.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.861
There's the door.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.322
And kind of mean.

14:27.492 --> 14:30.036
But good material.

14:30.077 --> 14:32.497
I'm a patron of the arts.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.255
Welcome to the neighborhood.

14:54.143 --> 14:57.104
Jesus! Do the fields need
tilling?

14:57.146 --> 14:59.440
Much as it pains me to deprive

14:59.482 --> 15:04.821
monsieur of his customary
14 hours, he has an appointment.

15:04.863 --> 15:07.782
Oh, shit. I completely spaced.

15:07.824 --> 15:12.161
I told Letha I'd squire her
to the amusement park later.

15:12.203 --> 15:14.622
Take her tomorrow.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.499
School starts tomorrow.

15:16.541 --> 15:19.460
Precisely why you need
new clothes.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.212
I don't need new clothes.

15:23.214 --> 15:26.634
It's taken me 17 years
to perfect my look, all right?

15:29.970 --> 15:35.602
Apparently not enough time to learn the
distinction between vintage and old.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.145
These rags are retired.
You're going shopping.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.734
Isn't Norman saying

15:42.776 --> 15:46.153
that in this economy
we need to be backing off

15:46.195 --> 15:48.489
on the conspicuous
consumption front?

15:48.531 --> 15:50.658
- It makes us unsympathetic.
- And I suppose

15:50.700 --> 15:53.369
if your Uncle Norman lent you
<i>The Communist Manifesto,</i>

15:53.411 --> 15:56.581
I'd have to find recipes
for borscht.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.333
May I, darling?

16:05.047 --> 16:09.093
Roman, you're an adult...
more or less.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.179
If you'd rather spend the day
with your cousin

16:12.221 --> 16:14.933
than your mother, just say so.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.478
I'd rather hang out
with Letha.

16:18.519 --> 16:21.021
Of course, darling.

16:39.332 --> 16:43.210
Now, I'm not sure
Norman would approve, but...

16:43.252 --> 16:46.088
I've arranged a small surprise
for indulging your poor

16:46.130 --> 16:49.676
old mother on the last day
of your summer vacation.

16:54.889 --> 16:57.892
You rented out Pennsylmania?

16:59.894 --> 17:03.439
(He laughs.) - I did.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.942
All right.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.867
Hey, girls.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.994
- Hello.
- Hey, Dad!

17:17.036 --> 17:19.622
Oh, thank God.
I could eat a phonebook.

17:19.664 --> 17:22.249
(Woman chuckles.)

17:22.290 --> 17:26.170
- They don't make those anymore.
- Well, you can

17:26.212 --> 17:29.507
have her's too, because evidently
your daughter is off sushi now.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.467
- Since when?
- I'm not

17:31.509 --> 17:34.846
off sushi; I'm off mercury.

17:34.888 --> 17:37.139
(cell phone ringing)
Hey, what are you reading?

17:39.684 --> 17:42.645
Hey, Rome. She what?

17:42.687 --> 17:45.189
- Angels?
- Pennsylmania?

17:45.231 --> 17:49.193
OK! See you then.

17:53.113 --> 17:55.157
(laughing)

17:55.199 --> 17:57.159
OK, wait, let me try.

17:57.201 --> 18:00.955
Ah... ah!

18:00.997 --> 18:03.082
(She laughs.)

18:03.123 --> 18:06.335
<i>Bellissima!</i>

18:06.377 --> 18:08.337
- All right, all right.
- Wait. OK.

18:08.379 --> 18:10.256
Last man... last man standing!

18:10.297 --> 18:13.384
- Feel the Zen.
- Wait, one, two, three!

18:13.426 --> 18:16.846
Ooh. Wow.

18:16.888 --> 18:19.015
What do you want to name it?
(laughing)

18:27.189 --> 18:29.734
Huh. Do you know
that Pennsylvania has

18:29.776 --> 18:32.737
more hate groups per capita
out of any state in the country?

18:32.779 --> 18:35.197
It's about time
we won something.

18:35.239 --> 18:38.117
We also lead the nation
in Hoho consumption.

18:38.158 --> 18:40.453
I wonder if there's
a correlation.

18:40.494 --> 18:43.247
The moral superiority
of being skinny?

18:43.289 --> 18:45.583
Hmm.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.669
Come on.

18:48.711 --> 18:50.379
Mm, not tonight.

18:50.421 --> 18:52.298
Seriously?

18:52.339 --> 18:54.467
Mm, I'm not in the mood.

18:54.508 --> 18:57.804
Come on! When else are you gonna
get on this without a line?

18:57.845 --> 19:01.599
When have you ever
stood in line?

19:09.565 --> 19:12.526
- What do you think they think of us?
- Who?

19:12.568 --> 19:15.446
Exactly.

19:15.488 --> 19:19.408
So... what am I thinking?

19:21.410 --> 19:24.413
Mmm... that you wish
the summer would never end.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.461
I'm thinking that it's time
to go home.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.212
Really?

19:32.254 --> 19:34.214
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on, no.

19:34.256 --> 19:37.135
- Mm-hmm!
- Do you want Bob?

19:37.176 --> 19:39.178
Yeah!

19:42.723 --> 19:45.309
Come on, cuz,
let's get out of here.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.353
(Roman laughing)

20:13.087 --> 20:15.798
Hey, Hemingway.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.884
Don't call me that.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.553
OK.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.930
I guess summer's over.

20:37.277 --> 20:41.490
(heavy footsteps)

21:12.105 --> 21:14.065
(girls laughing)

21:14.107 --> 21:17.317
(girl moaning)
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

21:17.359 --> 21:19.361
Hey, sis.

21:33.584 --> 21:37.880
There's this kid at my school.
He's an upir.

21:37.922 --> 21:40.507
An upir?

21:40.549 --> 21:43.136
Yeah, but I don't think
he knows it himself.

21:43.177 --> 21:45.930
He has a sister...
she isn't upir.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.932
I don't know
what she is. She is

21:47.974 --> 21:50.851
so big, she fills up a doorway.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.440
They're the Godfreys.

21:56.482 --> 21:59.152
That family seems fucked up.

21:59.193 --> 22:01.320
The Godfreys are my business.

22:01.361 --> 22:03.447
Stay away from them.

22:03.489 --> 22:06.575
- I am.
- OK.

22:22.008 --> 22:27.013
And? Have we got anything more enlightening
to report from our first day at school?

22:27.054 --> 22:28.931
There's this new kid.

22:31.851 --> 22:36.063
He's a gypsy. This girl's been spreading
all these crazy rumors about him.

22:36.105 --> 22:40.276
I think he's related to that guy
in the trailer by the river.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.489
Filth.

23:41.461 --> 23:44.006
(thunder)

23:44.048 --> 23:46.717
Pryce told me you were here!

23:46.759 --> 23:48.886
Pryce called you?

23:50.888 --> 23:52.430
That's funny.

23:52.472 --> 23:54.474
What is it?

23:56.602 --> 23:58.771
What is it?

23:58.812 --> 24:02.858
What is it?

24:02.900 --> 24:06.112
My legacy! (Thunder)

24:08.781 --> 24:11.158
My legacy.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.577
It's not even two years old!

24:13.619 --> 24:15.579
It's already 40 pounds!

24:15.621 --> 24:17.915
It knows what you're feeling

24:17.957 --> 24:21.294
from across the room!
You know how it knows that?

24:21.335 --> 24:24.213
You know it knows
because of the light!

24:24.255 --> 24:26.590
The fucking light!

24:26.632 --> 24:28.331
Have you considered putting
Shelley in a special care...

24:28.344 --> 24:30.052
Do not call her that!

24:30.094 --> 24:34.265
Do not call that abortion
by my daughter's name!

24:40.520 --> 24:43.732
I know it's my fault! I know!

24:43.774 --> 24:45.901
I brought evil into our house!

24:45.943 --> 24:49.905
- Oh, come on, J.R. Come on!
- And she may look like a woman,

24:49.947 --> 24:52.408
and she may fuck like a woman,

24:52.450 --> 24:54.492
but I will not be deceived!

24:54.534 --> 24:56.996
I hired a private investigator

24:57.037 --> 24:59.123
to find her people.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.334
Guess what, Norman?

25:01.375 --> 25:04.711
She doesn't have any.

25:04.753 --> 25:07.840
There are no people!

25:07.881 --> 25:10.343
Will you help me?

25:10.384 --> 25:12.845
I'll help you find
the right kind, yes.

25:12.886 --> 25:16.514
No. Help me destroy her.

25:16.556 --> 25:19.726
Before she destroys
our family.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.355
You're my goddamn brother!

25:22.396 --> 25:24.940
No one's going
to destroy anyone, J.R.

25:24.982 --> 25:27.525
No one.

25:27.567 --> 25:33.531
Now, maybe it's best you come and stay
with me and Marie for a little while, huh?

25:33.573 --> 25:35.201
Yeah.

25:37.203 --> 25:40.206
(whispering): I know
you're fucking her.

25:50.424 --> 25:52.510
(thunder)

26:20.037 --> 26:22.039

26:42.976 --> 26:46.980

27:01.495 --> 27:04.498
(Wheezing stops.)

27:07.876 --> 27:10.879
(Wheezing resumes.)

27:45.914 --> 27:47.916
I'm sorry, Roman.

28:05.601 --> 28:07.603

Annoyed, exasperated,

Olivia?

29:16.296 --> 29:19.883
Hmm. Paradox of a woman.

29:19.925 --> 29:23.220

Norman.

31:51.785 --> 31:54.580
What a wonderful surprise.

31:54.621 --> 31:58.041
Is this a serious proposal?

32:00.043 --> 32:01.961
Perhaps I spoke too soon.

32:02.003 --> 32:05.465
A 60% proposed increase
for research and development

32:05.507 --> 32:08.802
funding alone,
following a 30% increase

32:08.844 --> 32:11.388
from last quarter.

32:11.430 --> 32:14.767
Would you like to come inside?

32:14.808 --> 32:18.937
I can offer you, um,
a coffee... or a Valium.

32:18.978 --> 32:22.941
With no accompanying report of
anything approaching transparency

32:22.982 --> 32:25.944
of what exactly we're
setting out to produce.

32:25.985 --> 32:29.448
Money. We produce money.

32:29.489 --> 32:32.451
Your brother taught me that.
I can't imagine why it gives you

32:32.492 --> 32:34.787
- so much difficulty.
- Neither could my brother.

32:34.828 --> 32:37.873
You know, darling, if it's transparency
you're after, you could just

32:37.915 --> 32:40.500
simply ask Dr. Pryce
what he wants the money for.

32:40.542 --> 32:43.503
Well, he's the only person I know
who's a better liar than you are.

32:43.545 --> 32:45.130
He most certainly is not!

32:45.171 --> 32:48.467
Oh, don't be cute, Olivia.
You're bad at it.

32:51.010 --> 32:52.888
Come inside.

32:52.930 --> 32:56.099
(He chuckles.)
I can at least deduce

32:56.141 --> 32:59.394
what really brought you to
my bloody doorstep in comfort.

32:59.436 --> 33:01.980
(He sighs.)

33:02.021 --> 33:04.817
Pennsylmania, Olivia?
I mean, really?

33:04.858 --> 33:07.402
Oh, come on, Dr. Killjoy.

33:07.444 --> 33:09.947
They won't be children
much longer.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.198
It's an insult to the town.

33:12.240 --> 33:15.535
Well aware of your love affair
with appearances.

33:15.577 --> 33:19.247
And no favor to the kids either. You
know, you can spoil Roman all you want,

33:19.289 --> 33:21.374
but leave my daughter
out of it.

33:24.252 --> 33:29.424
I, um... can't control...

33:29.466 --> 33:33.428
who Roman decides
to spend his time with.

33:33.470 --> 33:37.223
Well, no one was accusing you

33:37.265 --> 33:40.268
of having any control
over him.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.496
(gasp)

34:13.510 --> 34:16.094
(police radio chatter)

34:16.137 --> 34:18.681
Oh, man, that's bad.

34:18.724 --> 34:21.059
That's really bad.
I know her family.

34:21.100 --> 34:23.311
I went to school with her dad.

34:25.313 --> 34:27.273
That's pretty tough.
First day at school.

34:27.315 --> 34:29.400
Some first day.

34:29.442 --> 34:32.696
- Anything in the perimeter?
- No sign of a weapon, Sheriff. - Tracks?

34:32.737 --> 34:35.699
- No. Nothing. It's all hard-packed sand.
- The car was all busted up

34:35.741 --> 34:38.911
on the road. Window broken in.

34:38.952 --> 34:41.286
Jesus Christ.

34:41.329 --> 34:43.540
Who could've done that?

34:43.581 --> 34:45.583
Who's that kid?

34:50.714 --> 34:54.342
Bring him to me.

34:54.384 --> 34:57.512
- Boy. Come here, please.
- Me, sir?

34:57.554 --> 35:00.306
- You're the only boy I see.
- I was just walking through.

35:00.348 --> 35:02.559
- Just come here, please, OK?
- OK.

35:02.601 --> 35:06.104
The sheriff would
like to have a word with you.

35:06.145 --> 35:07.981
You live around here, son?

35:08.023 --> 35:11.068
Yeah. Home's that way,
and school's that way,

35:11.109 --> 35:13.486
so I was... I was
just walking through.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.614
Did you happen to hear
anything last night?

35:15.655 --> 35:17.824
No, sir. It was a quiet night.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.576
What's your name?

35:19.618 --> 35:22.579
It's Peter, sir, uh, Rumancek.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.456
- What... what's going on here?
- Get his statement, get his ID,

35:24.497 --> 35:28.167
- make sure he gets to school.
- OK. Come on. Come on.

35:33.172 --> 35:35.050
Rumancek.

35:35.092 --> 35:39.888
- Vince Rumancek?
- Gypsy trash.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.565
I'll take you in my cruiser.
Come on. You can

35:41.578 --> 35:43.224
sit in the front, but
don't touch anything.

35:43.266 --> 35:45.235
<i>...police are describing is
as one of the most grizzly...</i>

35:45.248 --> 35:47.228
Hey. Hey, Shelley.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.739
<i>...In local memory. A young
student was found killed...</i>

35:48.752 --> 35:50.231
What is it?

35:50.273 --> 35:53.234
<i>And partially disemboweled
earlier this morning in Kilberry Park</i>

35:53.276 --> 35:56.780
<i>of south Hemlock Grove.</i>
(radio switched off)

35:56.822 --> 35:59.157
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

35:59.198 --> 36:01.827
It's OK. It's OK. I'm here.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.580
(Shelley sniffles.)

36:05.622 --> 36:07.791
I'm here.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.584
It's OK.

36:09.626 --> 36:12.754
<i>The coroner has tentatively</i>
<i>identified the victim</i>

36:12.796 --> 36:15.882
<i>as Brooke Bluebell, 17,</i>
<i>a student attending.</i>

36:15.924 --> 36:17.968
<i>Penrose High School.</i>
<i>Bluebell was last seen</i>

36:18.010 --> 36:20.386
<i>leaving school</i>
<i>yesterday afternoon,</i>

36:20.428 --> 36:22.848

36:22.889 --> 36:25.183
<i>Officials are refusing</i>
<i>to speculate</i>

36:25.224 --> 36:28.020
<i>on the cause of death,</i>
<i>but eyewitnesses suggest</i>

36:28.061 --> 36:31.898
<i>the ferocity of the attack suggests
an animal may have been responsible.</i>

36:31.940 --> 36:34.285
<i>Officials are asking for

36:34.298 --> 36:36.653
<i>seen any suspicious

36:36.695 --> 36:40.198
<i>- to contact the sheriff's office.</i>
- (Girl): Bet he knows something about it.

36:40.239 --> 36:42.784
(girl): Gypsy creep.

36:45.078 --> 36:48.081
- Come on.
- That's the guy you think is a werewolf?

36:53.753 --> 36:57.049
(cell phone ringing)

36:57.090 --> 36:59.592
- [Hello?]
- Hey, Letha.

36:59.634 --> 37:01.636
- Oh, my god, Dad.
- Can this be real?

37:01.678 --> 37:04.514
I just really needed
to hear your voice, OK?

37:04.556 --> 37:07.308
Yeah. It's good
to hear your voice too.

37:07.350 --> 37:10.311
I love you, OK, Letha? I...

37:10.353 --> 37:13.732
[It's very important right now that
you know how much I love you.]

37:13.773 --> 37:15.734
Yeah, I know.

37:15.775 --> 37:17.777
I love you too.

37:47.807 --> 37:52.104
You really hate coming here,
don't you, Norman? Me too!

37:56.315 --> 37:57.951
Just when I was getting used
to the sound of crickets.

37:57.964 --> 37:59.611
It's a fucking nightmare.

37:59.652 --> 38:01.654
It is that.

38:04.950 --> 38:07.911
I see that girl and I can't help but
think it could've been one of mine.

38:07.953 --> 38:09.913
Well, it could've been
any of ours.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.915
I'll put you two together.
That's all.

38:11.957 --> 38:14.500
Look, I don't know what it is
with you and Dr. Pryce,

38:14.542 --> 38:16.345
but he is the closest available
scientific authority.

38:16.358 --> 38:18.171
You really gonna make
me ask Olivia...

38:18.213 --> 38:21.340
- You know what he did.
- No, I don't. None of us do.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.890
Sheriff!

38:28.932 --> 38:31.517
Norman.

38:31.559 --> 38:35.730
Uh... Doctor,
sorry to bother you.

38:35.772 --> 38:38.066
- We know you're busy.
- No apology necessary.

38:38.108 --> 38:40.703
A tragedy like this
relieves one of adhering

38:40.716 --> 38:43.321
to the standard
social conventions.

38:43.362 --> 38:48.160
It shouldn't even require the summons
of a majority shareholder. Norman,

38:48.201 --> 38:50.162
how's your family?

38:50.203 --> 38:53.539
Let's assume if normally I don't
want you asking about my family,

38:53.581 --> 38:55.875
today doesn't change
a goddamn thing.

38:55.917 --> 38:58.253
Certainly.

38:58.295 --> 39:01.923
You were going to ask me
about an animal attack.

39:01.965 --> 39:06.678
Well, uh, we don't know
what it is.

39:08.972 --> 39:11.599
Oh, the autumn is unkind,
little flower.

39:11.641 --> 39:14.227
(screaming)

39:14.269 --> 39:16.646
Mm-hmm.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.901
- Huh.
- We're wasting our time.

39:25.822 --> 39:27.532
Mmhmm.

39:27.573 --> 39:31.369
Based on subcutaneous bite
patterns, I believe you can

39:31.410 --> 39:35.874
with certainty exclude from your
list a suspect on two legs.

39:35.915 --> 39:39.544
We didn't find any animal
tracks at the scene.

39:39.585 --> 39:43.965
Which is peculiar, but I can
only tell you what I see.

39:45.967 --> 39:50.263
Her... phone was on
when it happened.

39:52.265 --> 39:56.019
I got the impression that whatever
it was that was attacking her

39:56.061 --> 39:57.812
wanted her to watch.

39:57.854 --> 40:00.815
Fear is an intoxicant
to apex predators.

40:00.857 --> 40:04.236
It is not unusual for them
to disembowel prey animals

40:04.277 --> 40:07.239
and consume the fat
between the essential organs

40:07.280 --> 40:09.448
to keep them alive
as long as possible

40:09.490 --> 40:12.577
- during the process.
- You do realize a girl is dead.

40:12.618 --> 40:16.248
And in the interest of saving
precious time, I will mourn her passing

40:16.289 --> 40:18.541
subsequent our conversation.

40:18.583 --> 40:22.545
Was there anything else?

40:22.587 --> 40:24.547
He's all yours.

40:24.589 --> 40:27.342
No. Thank you, Doctor.

40:37.852 --> 40:42.274
I need... Do you trust
his analysis or not?

40:42.315 --> 40:46.319
I don't trust if you drew your gun and
shot him blood would leave his veins.

40:49.197 --> 40:51.908
In the midst of the throne
shall feed them,

40:51.950 --> 40:54.786
and shall lead them to living

40:54.827 --> 40:57.455
fountains of waters:

40:57.496 --> 40:59.498
And God...

41:17.392 --> 41:19.394
All right, man.

41:30.280 --> 41:34.784
(PA): <i>Tonight's vigil</i>
<i>for Brooke Bluebell will be held</i>

41:34.826 --> 41:37.703
<i>at Penrose High Stadium.</i>

41:37.745 --> 41:41.124
<i>Hemlock High students are</i>
<i>encouraged to attend.</i>

41:41.166 --> 41:44.710
<i>It'll be at 7 o'clock tonight.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

41:54.179 --> 41:56.348
Could an upir have done it?

41:56.389 --> 41:59.976
It's not their style...
usually.

42:17.369 --> 42:19.537
The vigil being held
later tonight...

42:19.578 --> 42:22.123
your sister would
like to attend.

42:22.165 --> 42:25.543
Pass. I've spent all day
around fucking crying girls.

42:28.463 --> 42:30.465
Did you know her?

42:33.592 --> 42:36.605
Didn't think there was a
pair of pom-poms in a

42:36.618 --> 42:39.640
50-mile radius that wasn't
within your purview.

42:39.682 --> 42:43.019
I didn't know her.
Different crowd, I guess.

42:47.232 --> 42:49.192
How are you, darling?

42:49.234 --> 42:52.820
I'm fine.
Why wouldn't I be fine?

42:57.450 --> 42:59.994
Do you see me as someone
you can trust?

43:00.036 --> 43:01.829
Yeah.

44:03.099 --> 44:04.642
<i>Peter!</i>

44:04.683 --> 44:07.645
Peter, dinner!

44:07.686 --> 44:09.314
Peter!

44:11.524 --> 44:13.318
PETER!

44:59.947 --> 45:02.950
(Roman): What did it
feel like?

45:04.952 --> 45:07.664
What did what feel like?

45:07.704 --> 45:10.707
Killing that girl.
