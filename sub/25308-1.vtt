01:00.726 --> 01:03.860
This is Cane to Mission Control,

01:03.862 --> 01:06.399
for the records.

01:07.599 --> 01:10.666
This is the next phase
to complete,

01:10.668 --> 01:13.603
the... most rational method

01:13.605 --> 01:18.207
of solving the problems
that have arisen.

01:18.209 --> 01:20.978
'The problem that has arisen.

01:20.980 --> 01:23.847
'I am that problem.'

01:23.849 --> 01:27.020
This is the rational solution.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.496
Awan was...

01:37.462 --> 01:40.065
...everything to me.

01:40.832 --> 01:42.064
'Home.'

01:42.066 --> 01:47.639
For all of our parallel life,
I felt what she felt.

01:49.775 --> 01:51.942
Without her to tell me,

01:51.944 --> 01:54.744
I am not even sure

01:54.746 --> 01:57.950
if I am one of you anymore.

02:02.888 --> 02:05.225
Now she is gone.

02:07.927 --> 02:10.693
'Eva loathes me.

02:10.695 --> 02:14.498
'I understand.
I am unable to contribute.

02:14.500 --> 02:17.903
'I am a phantom limb. Adrift.'

02:20.004 --> 02:22.138
We, uh...

02:22.140 --> 02:26.310
have tried to develop
a stronger link

02:26.312 --> 02:28.211
during our time together,

02:28.213 --> 02:30.413
but it...

02:30.415 --> 02:32.782
it cannot replace

02:32.784 --> 02:34.618
what has been lost.

02:34.620 --> 02:38.024
Eva's not to blame for this.
She is strong.

02:39.258 --> 02:41.561
I am not.

02:46.532 --> 02:48.801
'Cane.'

02:50.368 --> 02:51.804
Cane.

03:09.888 --> 03:11.591
Oh!

03:21.165 --> 03:23.733
'Hold.
Stay. Move with me.

03:23.735 --> 03:26.269
'One, two. And move. Together.

03:26.271 --> 03:28.304
'Slow.

03:28.306 --> 03:30.840
'Now. One, two, three. Engage.'

03:30.842 --> 03:33.342
- 'One, two, three.'
- 'One, two, three.'

03:33.344 --> 03:35.679
'Ah! Again. Now settle.'

03:35.681 --> 03:37.147
Twins.

03:37.149 --> 03:40.616
- 'Come with me. We move.'
- Cane and Awan. They work well.

03:40.618 --> 03:43.019
'Under these
easy conditions perhaps.'

03:43.021 --> 03:45.054
'This is the most complex

03:45.056 --> 03:47.156
'telepathic test we have,
Commander.'

03:47.158 --> 03:49.459
- 'Three. One.'
- Push them.

03:49.461 --> 03:50.459
'Start again from naught.'

03:50.461 --> 03:51.862
Faster.

03:51.864 --> 03:54.364
- 'I can't keep up.'
- 'Yes, you can.'

03:54.366 --> 03:56.866
'Stay with me.
Do not be distracted.'

03:56.868 --> 03:59.303
- Faster.
- 'It hurts.'

03:59.305 --> 04:03.173
'It is temporary.
We keep moving. We go.'

04:03.175 --> 04:07.109
'Yes. We move.
We keep moving.'

04:07.111 --> 04:09.245
'Allow it to ebb.
Concentrate on the rhythm.

04:09.247 --> 04:10.547
'The mathematics.'

04:10.549 --> 04:14.618
'You are with
me. We are there. It is us.'

04:14.620 --> 04:17.721
- 'Cane!'
- 'Awan. I have you.'

04:17.723 --> 04:20.892
- 'Thank you, brother.'
- 'We are there.'

04:30.069 --> 04:32.769
'Eva and Seth
of the Sash Hive.

04:32.771 --> 04:34.671
'Their father led
the colonization

04:34.673 --> 04:36.339
'of the ninth binary system.

04:36.341 --> 04:39.442
'Their lineage is renowned.'

04:39.444 --> 04:41.647
'Their bond is strong.'

05:39.771 --> 05:43.240
'There it is again.

05:43.242 --> 05:45.278
'Strong today.'

05:46.978 --> 05:49.146
'We have never heard
sound like it before.

05:49.148 --> 05:51.680
'It has harmonics
we cannot create.'

05:51.682 --> 05:55.252
- 'Do you study it?'
- 'No.

05:55.254 --> 05:57.219
'I listen every day.'

05:57.221 --> 05:59.488
'It is always strongest here

05:59.490 --> 06:02.858
'at this place
and at this time.'

06:05.363 --> 06:08.400
'It is nearly my time
to discover it.'

06:10.269 --> 06:14.171
'Cane.
I am at Mission Control.

06:14.173 --> 06:16.440
'You are
at the listening place again?'

06:16.442 --> 06:18.442
'Yes, sister.'

06:18.444 --> 06:20.913
'You must return.'

06:46.170 --> 06:48.839
'Pioneers,
you will leave this old world

06:48.841 --> 06:52.078
'and cut a path across
the universe to a new one.

06:54.612 --> 06:56.745
'We do not know
the precise dangers,

06:56.747 --> 06:59.048
'but you will be armed
with a living virus

06:59.050 --> 07:01.887
'to be activated on arrival.

07:03.088 --> 07:05.387
'We do not know
when we will see you again,

07:05.389 --> 07:09.459
'but these many years for us
will be few to you.'

07:09.461 --> 07:11.795
You're apprehensive.

07:11.797 --> 07:15.197
I'm curious.

07:15.199 --> 07:18.868
- 'I will miss you.'
- 'I will miss you.'

07:18.870 --> 07:21.671
'We will never break contact.

07:21.673 --> 07:24.940
'I will be with you
at every step.'

07:24.942 --> 07:26.776
'Intelligence has reached us

07:26.778 --> 07:30.012
'and we will find the sender.

07:30.014 --> 07:32.082
'It will be
our most remote colony,

07:32.084 --> 07:36.952
'and as such this is
our most perilous mission.

07:36.954 --> 07:40.325
'In our minds, we are with you.

07:45.096 --> 07:47.230
'Your twin will instruct you.

07:47.232 --> 07:51.270
'They will be the link to
the Hive, to Mission Control.

07:56.541 --> 08:00.110
'You will enter into a routine.

08:00.112 --> 08:02.882
'A routine
that will keep you sane.

08:03.714 --> 08:06.284
'You will work together

08:07.286 --> 08:11.089
'You will work
for the good of us all.

08:24.636 --> 08:26.570
'Cane.

08:26.572 --> 08:29.072
'Eva.

08:29.074 --> 08:32.278
'These will be my final words
to you both.

08:33.278 --> 08:36.345
'You must depart
into stranded night,

08:36.347 --> 08:40.015
'for your destiny is to appear
fruitful out of the lightness

08:40.018 --> 08:42.587
'that passing of time evokes.

08:44.089 --> 08:46.492
'Beware small steps.'

09:04.109 --> 09:08.210
What do you think the
destination planet will be like?

09:08.212 --> 09:10.347
It is too far to say.
We can only suppose.

09:10.349 --> 09:12.848
Its physical characteristics
will become more defined,

09:12.850 --> 09:13.849
as we get closer.

09:13.851 --> 09:15.919
And if we suppose?

09:15.921 --> 09:18.224
We need more information.

09:20.024 --> 09:22.892
It could be another Hive,
like our own.

09:22.894 --> 09:24.326
This is unlikely.

09:24.328 --> 09:26.631
If another hive were to exist,
we would surely sense it.

09:32.971 --> 09:35.037
The hydrogen is cooling.

09:35.039 --> 09:38.108
It is my responsibility.
You must eat your food.

09:42.813 --> 09:45.547
'Mission control. Awan.

09:45.549 --> 09:47.117
'Do you hear me?'

09:47.119 --> 09:48.618
'Yes. Go ahead.'

09:48.620 --> 09:51.820
'There appears to be
a problem with the hydrogen.

09:51.822 --> 09:54.056
'We may have strayed off course.

09:54.058 --> 09:56.392
'We are checking the telemetry.'

09:56.394 --> 09:59.329
'We advise that you deal
with the problem manually.

09:59.331 --> 10:03.299
'Take control away from
the ship. Cooling will occur.

10:03.301 --> 10:04.633
'If you level the core quickly,

10:04.635 --> 10:07.637
'the issue will be righted
and the danger averted.'

10:07.639 --> 10:09.705
Override to manual.

10:09.707 --> 10:11.641
'Status report, brother?'

10:11.643 --> 10:13.108
'Status now normal.'

10:13.110 --> 10:15.844
'Hand over
to ship control.'

10:15.846 --> 10:18.451
Hydrogen temperatures leveling.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.251
I miss your presence

10:21.253 --> 10:23.185
and the noise of the Hive.

10:23.187 --> 10:26.555
'Our minds are connected.
Do not miss me.'

10:26.557 --> 10:28.992
'You say that,
yet I'm having difficulties

10:28.994 --> 10:32.195
'in controlling these feelings.

10:32.197 --> 10:34.497
'I have problems
connecting with Eva.'

10:34.499 --> 10:37.032
'You have time
for it to develop.

10:37.034 --> 10:39.935
'It is important
that you allow it to.'

10:39.937 --> 10:42.705
'I hear you, sister.

10:42.707 --> 10:45.644
'I understand that I must.'

11:04.763 --> 11:06.496
You are fast.

11:06.498 --> 11:09.132
You were faster
with your brother.

11:09.134 --> 11:11.770
I must improve.

12:08.692 --> 12:13.363
'The sensation of stasis
is strange.

12:13.365 --> 12:17.302
'It is has that feeling
of being disappeared.

12:18.403 --> 12:20.469
'Wiped from existence.'

12:20.471 --> 12:23.439
'I remember the feeling
from the training simulations.'

12:23.441 --> 12:26.376
'Yes. Maybe.
But this is different.

12:26.378 --> 12:29.478
'The distance. The isolation.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.714
'Nothing can filter through.

12:31.716 --> 12:34.751
'We are so far.
Past star systems and colonies.

12:34.753 --> 12:37.453
'And... and consciousness
is sucked away.

12:37.455 --> 12:40.589
'Without thought.
Without dreams.

12:40.591 --> 12:43.826
'What are we
without these things?

12:43.828 --> 12:46.595
'When I am there,

12:46.597 --> 12:48.565
'do I exist?

12:48.567 --> 12:51.800
'And when I am here,
as we move at this speed,

12:51.802 --> 12:55.305
'it is hard to state
exactly where we are.'

12:55.307 --> 12:58.373
'It is strange
for me too, Cane,

12:58.375 --> 13:00.446
'to not have you there.

13:02.614 --> 13:05.214
'But you are on course
to the signal.'

13:05.216 --> 13:07.787
'Yes. We are on course.'

13:14.993 --> 13:17.263
'I have news.

13:18.263 --> 13:20.829
'I am pregnant.'

13:20.831 --> 13:22.799
'Do you know how many?'

13:22.801 --> 13:27.103
'Four. You may begin
to sense them soon.

13:27.105 --> 13:29.004
'That is what we hope.

13:29.006 --> 13:31.007
'There may be a connection.'

13:31.009 --> 13:33.309
'It will be welcome.

13:33.311 --> 13:34.710
'I will inform you

13:34.712 --> 13:36.881
'when their telepathic
connection comes into being.'

13:51.363 --> 13:55.364
Awan is pregnant.
She's going to have children.

13:55.366 --> 13:58.700
Children! That is unexpected.
How many?

13:58.702 --> 13:59.835
Four.

13:59.837 --> 14:01.970
So few?

14:01.972 --> 14:04.239
It's a family trait.

14:04.241 --> 14:05.675
You would prefer twins.

14:05.677 --> 14:08.277
Their more intense connection
would be good for you.

14:08.279 --> 14:10.649
Four will still bring
a strong connection.

14:11.783 --> 14:15.855
Eva is entering stasis.
Cane on deck.

14:38.710 --> 14:42.478
'There is nowhere
for my thoughts to go.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.647
'The silence is not easy.'

14:45.649 --> 14:48.483
'You must find comfort
where you can.

14:48.485 --> 14:51.823
'That is, with your co-pilot.'

14:53.258 --> 14:55.223
'Yes.

14:55.225 --> 14:58.194
'I will try. We will.'

14:58.196 --> 14:59.728
'Connect.

14:59.730 --> 15:02.464
'You were selected
for your compatibility.

15:02.466 --> 15:05.100
'You need this balance.

15:05.102 --> 15:07.804
'Mission Control depends on it.

15:07.806 --> 15:10.238
'We all do.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.778
'As do you both.'

15:29.527 --> 15:31.361
Play transmission.

15:34.566 --> 15:38.633
'The harmony of the
transmission is fascinating.'

15:38.635 --> 15:41.671
'We have studied it
to no avail.

15:41.673 --> 15:45.344
'It does not allow us to access
any further data on its origin.'

15:46.644 --> 15:49.648
'Its beauty
is in its harmony.'

15:50.981 --> 15:53.384
'Beauty?

15:54.152 --> 15:55.785
'Such complexity.

15:55.787 --> 15:57.453
'If I can decipher its message,

15:57.455 --> 15:59.622
'it will help us
when we arrive at it.

15:59.624 --> 16:02.691
'Face to face
with its originators perhaps.'

16:02.693 --> 16:04.526
'Mission Control
would like you to focus

16:04.528 --> 16:06.829
'on the mission, Cane,

16:06.831 --> 16:09.464
'lest you be diverted
by superfluous notions

16:09.466 --> 16:10.632
'such as these.

16:10.634 --> 16:13.806
'Its harmonies are
none of our concern.

16:14.672 --> 16:16.506
'Of your concern, brother.'

16:16.508 --> 16:19.742
'I'm sorry.
I retract those thoughts.

16:19.744 --> 16:22.512
'Solitary, individual thoughts.'

16:35.493 --> 16:39.098
'Cane, why is the signal
playing so loudly?'

17:12.363 --> 17:15.134
What could we call
the sound, Eva?

17:16.733 --> 17:20.368
Awan and I called it abstract,

17:20.371 --> 17:23.839
or something else.

17:23.842 --> 17:25.907
Perhaps it has a purpose
that we don't understand.

17:25.910 --> 17:28.944
It fascinates me.
Play transmission.

17:34.652 --> 17:37.556
Stop transmission.

17:38.957 --> 17:40.959
It troubles me.

17:50.401 --> 17:51.566
Play transmission.

18:03.413 --> 18:06.684
Stop transmission.

19:07.612 --> 19:10.082
'Eva, status update.'

19:11.048 --> 19:12.582
'Seth.

19:12.584 --> 19:14.717
'All levels normal.

19:14.719 --> 19:17.018
'Trajectory is good.

19:17.020 --> 19:19.790
'Margin for error
is at a minimum.'

19:25.230 --> 19:26.828
'And Cane?'

19:26.830 --> 19:30.665
'Our connection
is not yet strong.

19:30.667 --> 19:32.567
'But does Awan
not report on him?'

19:32.569 --> 19:34.402
'She does.'

19:34.404 --> 19:37.440
'We are working well,
brother.

19:37.442 --> 19:39.674
'As expected.'

19:39.676 --> 19:41.576
'That is good.

19:41.578 --> 19:42.812
'You are to tell me,

19:42.814 --> 19:44.713
'should anything
out of the ordinary happen.

19:44.715 --> 19:47.516
'As your brother, as well
as your point of contact

'to Mission Control, of course.'

19:51.689 --> 19:54.757
'He plays the signal.

19:54.759 --> 19:58.594
'Over and over, he
listens to that transmission.

19:58.596 --> 20:00.496
'He talks about it.'

20:00.498 --> 20:03.266
'I see.'

20:03.268 --> 20:05.267
'It will not be a problem.

20:05.269 --> 20:09.740
'I will see to it that he
continues to perform his tasks.'

21:50.240 --> 21:51.239
Uh.

21:53.510 --> 21:54.744
Oh, no.

21:54.746 --> 21:57.513
'Awan,
I hear their consciousness.'

21:57.515 --> 22:00.216
- 'So painful.'

22:00.218 --> 22:02.117
'What is it?
What is happening?

22:02.119 --> 22:04.452
'This does not
feel like it should.

22:04.454 --> 22:07.088
'This isn't right.'

22:09.292 --> 22:12.163
'My babies.'

22:21.972 --> 22:24.472
- 'Awan!'
- 'Cane!

22:24.474 --> 22:27.042
'Help... help me.

22:27.044 --> 22:28.447
'Someone.'

22:29.713 --> 22:32.116
'I do not feel them.

22:33.384 --> 22:35.386
'Where are they?'

22:50.667 --> 22:53.635
Brother, help me.

23:01.412 --> 23:03.879
'Awan?'

23:03.881 --> 23:06.351
'What is happening?

23:49.861 --> 23:52.531
'Awan, talk to me.'

24:16.453 --> 24:18.490
Awan is dead.

24:19.457 --> 24:21.590
What?

24:21.592 --> 24:23.495
In childbirth, she died.

24:24.628 --> 24:26.629
And the children?

24:26.631 --> 24:28.596
They are dead.

24:28.598 --> 24:31.569
- All of them?
- Yes.

24:37.674 --> 24:40.377
I have no connection
to Home now.

25:12.943 --> 25:15.346
'You must concentrate.'

25:16.713 --> 25:19.350
'Yes, we will. I must.'

27:00.384 --> 27:02.988
Stop. Go back.

27:05.221 --> 27:08.390
Go.

27:08.392 --> 27:11.325
Stop. Go back.

27:11.327 --> 27:13.828
Play again.

27:13.830 --> 27:17.565
Stop. Go back.

27:28.045 --> 27:31.048
- Stop. Go back.
- 'Cane.'

27:32.316 --> 27:36.151
- And again.
- 'Cane.'

27:36.153 --> 27:39.024
Stop. Go back. Play.

27:40.257 --> 27:43.191
Go back.

27:43.193 --> 27:45.526
Play again.

27:45.528 --> 27:47.766
Cane!

27:50.267 --> 27:53.337
Stop.

27:56.073 --> 27:58.777
Tomorrow we should
practice mind-training.

27:59.876 --> 28:02.180
It will focus you.

28:19.529 --> 28:21.963
'The absence
is confusing him further.'

28:21.965 --> 28:24.399
'It is a tragedy
for the mission.

28:24.401 --> 28:26.768
'He needs to stay strong.

28:26.770 --> 28:30.305
'He depends solely on you
for his habilitation now.'

28:30.307 --> 28:32.975
'If I can help him to focus,

28:32.977 --> 28:36.210
'that will give him balance.

28:36.212 --> 28:40.315
'I need him to remain
concentrated on the mission.

28:40.317 --> 28:44.655
'I cannot imagine
how I would cope without you.

28:45.955 --> 28:48.590
'Seth?'

28:48.592 --> 28:51.629
'Report back
on his progress, sister.'

28:59.502 --> 29:02.036
I'm trying to block you
from reading me.

29:02.038 --> 29:05.407
Try harder.

29:05.409 --> 29:09.280
- You're blocking me.
- I'm uniquely perceptive.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.581
You're strong.

29:12.583 --> 29:16.121
You could block me
if you wanted to.

29:19.022 --> 29:21.326
I could never hide from Awan.

29:22.292 --> 29:24.495
That is normal.

29:27.364 --> 29:29.832
It is your turn
to chart the course.

29:29.834 --> 29:32.202
That is the routine.

29:36.140 --> 29:38.843
Routine. Routine.

29:56.426 --> 29:59.296
'I know that
you can't hear me, but...

30:01.699 --> 30:04.169
'Can anyone hear me?

30:06.336 --> 30:08.906
'You must be close,
close enough?

30:11.141 --> 30:13.875
'Too far.

30:13.877 --> 30:16.178
'Please answer.

30:16.180 --> 30:19.847
'There are many of you
out there. There must be.

30:19.849 --> 30:22.250
'Can you hear me?

30:22.252 --> 30:24.923
'Hear me! Hear me!

30:30.227 --> 30:32.564
'Please answer.'

34:23.260 --> 34:25.563
Too quiet.

34:27.331 --> 34:29.331
Play transmission.

34:36.106 --> 34:38.810
Louder.

34:43.413 --> 34:45.817
Louder!

35:01.565 --> 35:03.101
'Cane?'

35:10.541 --> 35:13.978
- Cane, what's going on?
- It's harmonious.

35:16.512 --> 35:18.646
Ship! Revert to auxiliary power.

35:21.552 --> 35:24.385
I'm trying to remember.

35:24.387 --> 35:27.454
You need to stop this.

35:27.456 --> 35:30.825
'Hibernate.
Go into stasis.'

35:30.827 --> 35:33.994
I'm worried about
your state of mind.

35:33.996 --> 35:36.130
'It needs me to discover
what it wants. I'm close.

35:36.132 --> 35:39.434
'I think I'm close
to deciphering its meaning.'

35:39.436 --> 35:41.769
'You need to
regain your control.

35:41.771 --> 35:45.307
'With this deviation,
you are losing me.

35:45.309 --> 35:46.474
'Our connection will aid you

35:46.476 --> 35:50.311
'so do not distance yourself
from me.

35:50.313 --> 35:52.949
'The mission needs you focused.

35:56.820 --> 35:58.720
'What is that around your neck?'

35:58.722 --> 36:02.059
'It helps me to think,
to remember.

36:05.695 --> 36:08.063
'I am back on deck now.
You do not need to wait here.

36:08.065 --> 36:09.967
'You can go.'

37:16.733 --> 37:19.336
'Do you like
the food we have here?

37:21.905 --> 37:24.307
'Do you like the food?'

37:26.777 --> 37:29.644
Why won't you speak to me?

37:29.646 --> 37:32.950
Whether I like it or not
is irrelevant.

37:34.284 --> 37:36.854
The question is irrelevant.

38:11.487 --> 38:14.057
'Are you awake?'

38:15.759 --> 38:18.360
'Yes.
You should be asleep.'

38:18.362 --> 38:21.996
'There's no night or day
here. We're inventing it.'

38:21.998 --> 38:23.097
'You are thinking along

38:23.099 --> 38:26.467
'these abstract lines again,
Cane.

38:26.469 --> 38:28.036
'I'm concerned about this.'

38:28.038 --> 38:30.304
'Don't sleep yet. Please.'

38:30.306 --> 38:32.474
'Good night, Cane.'

38:32.476 --> 38:34.041
'I want to ask about you.

38:34.043 --> 38:36.911
'I don't know much about you,
where you're from, your family.

38:36.913 --> 38:39.914
'Where are you from?
What age are your parents?

38:39.916 --> 38:41.648
'Do you want to know about me?

38:41.650 --> 38:44.786
'You can ask anything
you want about me.'

38:44.788 --> 38:47.255
'I am one of many,
like everybody else.'

38:47.257 --> 38:49.858
'We are not like
everybody else.

38:49.860 --> 38:52.494
'We are separate.'

38:52.496 --> 38:55.333
'We are not separate,
Cane.'

38:57.134 --> 38:59.436
I am separate.

39:03.639 --> 39:06.307
Get away, keep away, get away.

39:11.514 --> 39:13.782
Mine. Mine now.

39:16.186 --> 39:19.090
New space.

39:19.722 --> 39:22.157
Eva.

39:24.860 --> 39:27.362
Cane?

39:27.364 --> 39:31.166
'Use up. Use up.
Use... use up.'

39:31.168 --> 39:33.901
What are you doing?
What are you saying? Cane?

39:33.903 --> 39:36.737
'I am this.

39:36.739 --> 39:39.606
'Shut out. Shut you out.

39:39.608 --> 39:42.112
'Trash. Waste.'

39:55.659 --> 39:57.025
'What are you doing
in there?'

39:57.027 --> 40:01.563
'Mine, mine, mine.'
Mine, mine, mine. Mine.

40:01.565 --> 40:03.465
'Stay out.

40:03.467 --> 40:06.400
'Stay out. Mine.

a planet in the habitable zone.

under control.'

'Is Cane under control?'

40:46.409 --> 40:48.675
'It is difficult.

'He is causing me concern.'

'Yes.

distance yourself from him now.

'Do not jeopardize

'I will need you

their news?

'There must be news.'

Are you blocking me?

42:21.137 --> 42:23.304
Have you heard
from Mission Control?

42:23.306 --> 42:26.608
Only as I have reported to you.

42:26.610 --> 42:29.646
And how do I know that?
I have only your word for it.

42:31.748 --> 42:32.847
Yes, my word.

42:32.849 --> 42:35.385
How do I know you're not lying?

42:42.592 --> 42:46.630
- Did they mention Awan?
- I did not say that they did.

42:49.733 --> 42:53.967
- Seth did not mention Awan?
- Why should he do so?

42:53.969 --> 42:55.672
She's dead.

42:58.273 --> 42:59.574
The dead are disposed of.

42:59.576 --> 43:02.012
We do not have reason
to speak of these things.

43:06.849 --> 43:09.286
'You should rest, Cane.'

44:35.972 --> 44:38.740
'This behavior is uncommon.

- It's for you.

'A shard from the engine room,

and carved into.'

I have decided to go
into stasis hibernation.

It's not your turn.

46:20.043 --> 46:22.610
Hm. I want to.

Stay with me.

- What if something goes wrong?
- The probability is minimal.

55:35.630 --> 55:37.933
Next thing.

55:40.802 --> 55:43.704
This is the next phase
to complete.

55:43.706 --> 55:45.639
The...

55:45.641 --> 55:47.307
most rational method

55:47.309 --> 55:50.844
of solving the problems
which have arisen.

55:50.846 --> 55:54.280
The problem that has arisen.

55:54.282 --> 55:56.717
I am the problem.

55:56.719 --> 55:59.021
This is the rational solution.

56:02.724 --> 56:05.728
'Awan meant everything to me.

56:08.396 --> 56:11.101
'The world. Home.'

56:13.702 --> 56:16.373
For all of our parallel life...

56:17.773 --> 56:20.043
...I felt what she felt.

56:21.043 --> 56:24.478
Without her to tell me, I...

56:24.480 --> 56:28.918
...don't even know if I am
one of you anymore.

56:36.659 --> 56:39.425
'You are
losing control, sister.'

56:39.427 --> 56:42.695
- What? What is it?
- 'Can you feel it?

56:42.697 --> 56:45.402
'Your weakness.'

56:46.534 --> 56:49.204
'An uncertain fate now.

56:53.775 --> 56:55.275
'Hello, distant friend.

56:55.277 --> 56:58.579
'You must depart
into stranded night.

56:58.581 --> 57:01.418
'Beware small steps. Sister.'

57:05.221 --> 57:06.523
Cane.

57:36.351 --> 57:38.952
'I need to make a report
to Mission Control.

57:38.954 --> 57:41.121
'I can only describe
these events.

57:41.123 --> 57:44.126
'I need your guidance
on how to act upon them.'

57:45.728 --> 57:48.865
'Proceed.
Tell us. Tell me.'

57:50.932 --> 57:52.932
'My co-pilot
hung himself by the neck

57:52.934 --> 57:54.901
'from a length of material,

57:54.903 --> 57:58.938
'with the purpose
of killing himself

57:58.940 --> 58:01.708
'and leaving me
on board the ship.'

58:01.710 --> 58:04.280
'And is he alive?'

58:04.980 --> 58:07.280
'He is alive, yes.'

58:07.282 --> 58:10.150
'Sedate and restrain him.

58:10.152 --> 58:13.052
'You must assure him
of his place in the Hive.

58:13.054 --> 58:16.889
'In his mental state, he has
strayed and he must return.

58:16.891 --> 58:19.461
'We will need him.'

58:36.445 --> 58:40.981
'For all of our parallel
life, I felt what she felt.

58:40.983 --> 58:43.016
'And without her to tell me,

58:43.018 --> 58:48.322
'I am not even sure
if I am one of you anymore.'

58:48.324 --> 58:50.389
Back, play.

58:50.391 --> 58:56.231
'I am not even sure
if I am one of you anymore.'

59:07.710 --> 59:09.976
'Not one of us.

59:09.978 --> 59:12.612
'Not one of us anymore.'

59:12.614 --> 59:15.148
'If he is not,

59:15.150 --> 59:19.489
'then he must be terminated
after reaching the destination.'

59:20.588 --> 59:24.291
'But, brother,
I need Cane for our return.

59:24.293 --> 59:27.793
'Mission Control must know this.

59:27.795 --> 59:30.500
'Without him I cannot take off.

'Seth?'

01:00:12.907 --> 01:00:15.409
'What is
the mission status, Eva?'

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:18.077
'Trajectory is consistent.

01:00:18.079 --> 01:00:20.682
'Fuel levels normal.

'Distance corresponds
to calculations.

'Cluster galaxy charted.'

'This mission
is not mine, Seth.'

01:01:25.813 --> 01:01:27.683
'Do you not hear us?'

01:02:08.123 --> 01:02:10.659
'You are of no use, Cane.

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:14.530
'You are disconnected and weak.'

01:02:16.063 --> 01:02:18.634
Oh! Aah!

01:02:19.867 --> 01:02:21.735
You must rest.

01:02:21.737 --> 01:02:24.606
- Aah!
- You are weak.

01:02:26.875 --> 01:02:29.211
No.

01:02:34.081 --> 01:02:36.719
Untie me. I am not a danger.

01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:42.791
Would you let me see the planet?

01:02:44.358 --> 01:02:45.458
I want to see the planet.

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.626
The civilization
that made the sound.

01:02:47.628 --> 01:02:50.063
If I can...

01:02:50.065 --> 01:02:52.164
connect...

01:02:52.166 --> 01:02:54.733
Mission Control
has not yet decided your role

01:02:54.735 --> 01:02:57.272
when we reach the planet.

01:03:02.077 --> 01:03:04.413
This will calm you.

01:03:43.619 --> 01:03:45.452
'You will land
in a body of water

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:47.590
'close to a populated area.

01:03:49.423 --> 01:03:52.092
'This way, the virus will be
at its most effective

'when released.

'The indigenous species
will be wiped out

'at an exponential rate.'

01:03:59.367 --> 01:04:00.900
'And Cane?'

01:04:00.902 --> 01:04:03.235
'He must not complicate
or compromise

'the release of the virus.

'We only get one chance at
setting it amongst the natives.'

01:04:27.028 --> 01:04:29.496
I only see you once a day.

01:04:29.498 --> 01:04:31.331
Routine.

01:04:31.333 --> 01:04:33.266
I used to be in touch
with the Hive

01:04:33.268 --> 01:04:35.538
every minute of every day.

01:04:37.672 --> 01:04:40.475
Please.

01:04:41.242 --> 01:04:42.342
Let me connect with Seth.

01:04:42.344 --> 01:04:44.744
Things are different now.

01:04:44.746 --> 01:04:46.782
I dreamed about him.

01:04:49.184 --> 01:04:52.321
Ignore your dreams.
They do not matter.

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:16.409
We are approaching orbit.

01:05:16.411 --> 01:05:20.280
You have to help me prepare.
Are you recovered?

01:05:20.282 --> 01:05:22.715
- Yes. I am sorry.
- This is irrelevant.

01:05:22.717 --> 01:05:25.251
Are you prepared
to complete the mission?

01:05:25.253 --> 01:05:28.457
Yes. For the good of us all.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.579
'Hydrogen?'

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:54.313
'Dropping to target level.'

01:05:54.315 --> 01:05:56.282
'Slowing to orbit.'

01:05:56.284 --> 01:05:58.818
'Burners prepared.'

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:01.121
'Entering orbit.
Are we at speed?'

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:02.655
'We are.'

01:06:02.657 --> 01:06:04.994
'Adjusted to gravity.'

01:06:06.193 --> 01:06:09.030
'Preparing to land.'

01:07:13.894 --> 01:07:16.431
I have seen them.

01:07:27.442 --> 01:07:30.809
They appear disconnected...

01:07:30.811 --> 01:07:32.714
and weak.

01:07:34.215 --> 01:07:36.751
This is fascinating.

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:48.494
It does not have the same sounds
as the other transmissions,

01:07:48.496 --> 01:07:51.498
the same harmonics, melody.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.103
It sounds primitive enough.

01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:57.637
It is only verbal.

01:07:57.639 --> 01:08:01.610
There doesn't seem
to be anything cerebral.

01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:20.058
The virus requires
the DNA of the species

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.096
to ensure safe passage.

01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:27.970
Next thing.

01:08:41.582 --> 01:08:43.719
Next thing.

01:09:23.256 --> 01:09:24.827
Oh...!

01:10:03.597 --> 01:10:05.701
'Cane?'

01:10:14.876 --> 01:10:16.979
Cane?

01:10:23.618 --> 01:10:25.988
What have you done?

01:10:27.622 --> 01:10:30.025
I can't sense you.

01:10:39.266 --> 01:10:41.336
'Cane?'

01:12:23.837 --> 01:12:26.841
Abort.

01:12:31.246 --> 01:12:33.414
Reset!

01:13:00.007 --> 01:13:03.009
'I could feel a change in you,

01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:06.446
'a sudden absence
and then a surge.'

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:08.180
'Cane.

'that has been so close
for so long.'

01:13:12.153 --> 01:13:14.653
'So now he is deceased?'

01:13:14.655 --> 01:13:16.789
'He is no longer with us.'

01:13:16.791 --> 01:13:18.991
'Good.

'We are almost there, sister.

'Your work for the Hive
has been impressive.

'You are a pioneer.

'Record the details.
Recount them to me.

'You will prepare the terrain
for our arrival.'

01:14:14.916 --> 01:14:17.351
'I know what I need to do.'

01:14:30.131 --> 01:14:32.598
'They have structure.

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.034
'And society.

'They are singular.

'Not like us.

'Or maybe they are.

'The similarities are striking.'

'Do not be distracted
by them now.

'Do you remember us
as children?'

'Eva.

that you must do.'

Cane! I'm sorry. I...

- I killed...
- You've seen them?

I killed her.

going to kill them all.

you are there now.'

why did you wake me?

I shouldn't have woken you.

What are they like?

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:29.237
- 'Do not waver.'
- They are confused.

01:18:30.037 --> 01:18:31.669
Useless.

01:18:31.671 --> 01:18:33.772
Fragile.

01:18:33.774 --> 01:18:35.508
Wasteful.

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:37.576
She fought me.
I had to kill her.

No, you didn't.

for us now.'

If you take one more step,

01:18:47.421 --> 01:18:50.525
I will be forced
to kill you too!

01:18:51.993 --> 01:18:54.026
Play transmission.

01:19:01.034 --> 01:19:03.535
What else did you see?

with you, Eva?'
