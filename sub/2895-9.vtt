WEBVTT

00:00.147 --> 00:01.334
Previously on Suits...

00:01.335 --> 00:05.346
I want you to decide if you
love me more than you hate

00:05.346 --> 00:10.184
what I did, and if you do,
then I want you to come home.

00:10.318 --> 00:12.052
The only they'll definitely
find if they get a look at

00:12.220 --> 00:14.021
those files,
is that you embezzled money.

00:14.139 --> 00:17.524
Listen to me, God damn it.
We need to undo this deal.

00:17.642 --> 00:20.060
- We have nothing to hide.
- No, no, this is a ploy.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.279
He's trying to get me on
record stating that we have

00:22.430 --> 00:24.448
everything,
and if I find nothing,

00:24.599 --> 00:26.900
he's gonna file malicious
prosecution charges.

00:27.068 --> 00:30.120
Actually, Sean, I'm filing
those charges right now.

00:30.271 --> 00:31.622
Harvey went to court
this morning,

00:31.740 --> 00:34.074
and agreed to hand over
every single document

00:34.209 --> 00:37.244
on the Gillis takeover,
including Forstman.

00:37.328 --> 00:40.214
Shit!

00:40.298 --> 00:41.749
Then it's only a matter of time

00:41.916 --> 00:43.384
before I'm marched
out of here in handcuffs.

00:43.468 --> 00:45.108
If he did make
a dirty deal with Forstman,

00:45.136 --> 00:46.737
it wouldn't have been
in those documents.

00:46.755 --> 00:47.921
It would've been in--
the documents

00:48.089 --> 00:49.969
we just told the court
we're happy to turn over.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.091
What are you going to do?

00:51.226 --> 00:54.428
I'm gonna find out
what the hell Louis did.

00:56.564 --> 00:58.182
I made a huge mistake.

01:05.973 --> 01:07.241
What's going on?

01:07.358 --> 01:08.692
Louis, I want you
to tell Harvey

01:08.827 --> 01:10.828
exactly what you just told me,
or I will.

01:10.978 --> 01:12.112
He doesn't have to.

01:12.247 --> 01:13.697
He made a dirty deal
with Forstman.

01:13.815 --> 01:15.499
Harvey, I can explain.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.000
Explain what, that you
put the firm in jeopardy

01:17.151 --> 01:18.512
all because you had
to be the hero?

01:18.620 --> 01:19.837
I didn't do it
to be the hero.

01:19.987 --> 01:21.004
I didn't even know

01:21.155 --> 01:22.355
I was gonna do it at all.
What?

01:22.490 --> 01:25.342
The deal was closed, and
you were so happy we won.

01:25.493 --> 01:28.295
Then I went back that night,
Forstman said if I didn't

01:28.430 --> 01:30.380
funnel the money overseas,
the deal was off,

01:30.515 --> 01:32.549
so I did it.

01:35.019 --> 01:36.403
There's more.

01:36.538 --> 01:38.772
How do <i>you</i> know
there's more?

01:38.873 --> 01:41.642
Because with Forstman
there's always more.

01:44.212 --> 01:48.248
He made me take a million
dollars out of the deal

01:48.349 --> 01:51.652
so I couldn't turn on him later.

01:51.753 --> 01:54.121
- Jesus Christ.
- I had no choice!

01:54.255 --> 01:55.622
Bullshit,
you had no choice!

01:55.740 --> 01:57.624
You could've said no at any
goddamn point along the way,

01:57.742 --> 02:00.160
but you didn't, because all
you cared about was yourself.

02:00.295 --> 02:01.735
Okay, if I care
about myself so much,

02:01.863 --> 02:03.881
how come I'm in here telling
you that I'm gonna confess?

02:04.031 --> 02:05.165
You want to confess?
Be my guest!

02:05.300 --> 02:09.051
Harvey, that's enough.

02:09.169 --> 02:14.641
Louis...the problem with
that is that we're innocent.

02:14.759 --> 02:17.394
Cahill's plan is to throw mud
against the wall

02:17.545 --> 02:18.545
and see what sticks.

02:18.596 --> 02:20.264
You tell him
about what you did,

02:20.398 --> 02:23.817
and all of a sudden,
everything sticks.

02:23.902 --> 02:26.186
Okay.

02:26.321 --> 02:28.155
But I have to do something
to help.

02:28.273 --> 02:32.459
You will,
when the time comes.

02:32.594 --> 02:34.928
Right now, I need
to talk to Harvey.

02:45.573 --> 02:47.090
I can't believe
you're taking this

02:47.241 --> 02:48.241
as well as you are.

02:48.259 --> 02:49.543
I'm not taking
this well at all.

02:49.627 --> 02:52.045
Then what the hell are
you being so nice to him for?

02:52.180 --> 02:53.680
Did you hear?

02:53.765 --> 02:54.882
He was going to confess.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.433
I had to calm him down.

02:56.551 --> 02:58.352
So you're not
gonna stand by him?

02:58.436 --> 02:59.770
Stand by him?

02:59.888 --> 03:01.188
The second this
thing is over,

03:01.306 --> 03:04.775
I'm gonna fire
his goddamn ass.

03:07.862 --> 03:09.313
How was your shower?

03:09.430 --> 03:10.564
It was great.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.372
Rachel, you don't
have to clean up for me.

03:12.433 --> 03:13.617
I live here.

03:13.768 --> 03:17.037
I know, I just...I want
everything to be perfect.

03:17.121 --> 03:20.624
It is.

03:20.775 --> 03:22.826
Is this my parents'
photo album?

03:22.961 --> 03:26.246
Oh, yeah, it was in
the back of the closet.

03:26.381 --> 03:29.249
Yeah, I know where it was.
Why is it out here?

03:29.417 --> 03:35.422
Because I was looking for
pictures of you.

03:38.643 --> 03:40.978
What do you want to do
for dinner tonight?

03:41.095 --> 03:42.012
I was thinking
maybe we could hit

03:42.146 --> 03:43.564
that little Mexican spot.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.766
No. You just got back here.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.184
I don't want to go anywhere.

03:47.301 --> 03:49.820
I don't either, but we
don't have anything to eat.

03:49.971 --> 03:51.488
- Don't we?
- Well, I know for a fact

03:51.639 --> 03:53.490
we don't have any bean
and cheese burritos.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.192
Mm, then why are there
six of them in the fridge

03:55.326 --> 03:58.195
right now?

04:03.167 --> 04:04.952
[Closes refrigerator door]

04:05.086 --> 04:06.703
You hate them.

04:06.838 --> 04:09.623
I do, but you love them,
and I wanted you

04:09.757 --> 04:12.376
to have them here
when you came home.

04:12.493 --> 04:14.428
And what if I
didn't come home tonight?

04:14.545 --> 04:18.932
Then I would have bought
fresh ones again tomorrow.

04:19.050 --> 04:22.052
Thanks, Rachel.

04:22.186 --> 04:24.354
It's good to have you home.

04:24.472 --> 04:28.475
It's good to be home.

04:32.897 --> 04:35.532
What happened?

04:35.683 --> 04:37.618
I thought you had a date.

04:37.702 --> 04:39.653
I canceled it,
and I asked you a question.

04:39.821 --> 04:40.981
I don't want
to talk about it,

04:41.022 --> 04:42.239
because I know what
you're going to say.

04:42.373 --> 04:44.124
Harvey, I don't even
know what exactly Louis did.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.159
He broke the law
to close Forstman.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.879
He broke it or Forstman
made him break it?

04:48.997 --> 04:49.997
- What's the goddamn difference?
- Harvey--

04:50.081 --> 04:51.548
You don't have to say
it, Donna,

04:51.699 --> 04:52.899
I've heard
it a thousand times.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.668
Louis only did this
to get my approval.

04:54.802 --> 04:56.470
And you know what,
I don't give a shit

04:56.587 --> 04:58.005
that I agreed to be
his best man.

04:58.139 --> 05:00.090
He put you, me, and every one
of us in jeopardy

05:00.224 --> 05:01.258
to get what he wanted.

05:01.392 --> 05:02.676
Well, I was
gonna say that,

05:02.844 --> 05:04.011
but instead I'll say this:

05:04.145 --> 05:05.595
You put us all
in jeopardy too.

05:05.713 --> 05:07.180
When the hell
did I do that?

05:07.315 --> 05:09.516
The day you hired Mike,
and by the way,

05:09.651 --> 05:11.351
I'm guessing he wouldn't
even be back here

05:11.519 --> 05:13.020
if Louis hadn't done
what he did.

05:13.187 --> 05:15.822
Then tell that to Jessica,
'cause when it's over,

05:15.940 --> 05:18.909
she's gonna fire him.

05:24.065 --> 05:27.334
They keep this
place open late for you?

05:27.452 --> 05:29.086
Ownership
has its privileges.

05:29.236 --> 05:30.871
[Glass clinks onto the table]

05:31.039 --> 05:32.539
What do you want, Harvey?

05:32.674 --> 05:34.314
I want you to undo
the dirty deal you made

05:34.342 --> 05:35.509
with Louis Litt.

05:35.626 --> 05:38.145
Dirty deal.
Doesn't sound like me at all.

05:38.246 --> 05:39.963
How does prison sound?

05:40.098 --> 05:41.882
Because the S.E.C.
is gonna get a record

05:42.016 --> 05:43.717
of the shit you pulled
tomorrow morning.

05:43.851 --> 05:47.387
There is no record,
'cause I didn't do anything.

05:47.522 --> 05:49.022
Louis Litt came to me,

05:49.107 --> 05:51.108
and he's the one
who embezzled money.

05:51.258 --> 05:53.143
And your grudge
isn't with Louis.

05:53.277 --> 05:56.730
It's with me, so let him go.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.482
Live to fight <i>me</i> another day.

05:58.616 --> 06:03.203
If I let him off,
I let you off,

06:03.321 --> 06:05.038
and I don't think
I want to do that.

06:05.156 --> 06:07.657
Then you're forcing me to
turn you in for what you did

06:07.792 --> 06:10.961
12 years ago.

06:11.112 --> 06:13.964
No way.
You're not gonna do that,

06:14.115 --> 06:15.799
because you did it too, pal.

06:15.950 --> 06:18.585
You're right, I did.
But if you did it to Louis

06:18.753 --> 06:22.005
and you did it to me, you
did it to a hundred others.

06:22.123 --> 06:24.174
And if you don't
do what I'm asking,

06:24.308 --> 06:26.226
I'll just have to find
the one in a hundred

06:26.344 --> 06:28.095
that's in a position
to turn on you.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.430
I'll take my chances, Harvey.

07:20.335 --> 07:22.169
- I never meant to--
- Louis...

07:22.253 --> 07:24.538
I understand why you did
what you did.

07:24.706 --> 07:27.541
- You do?
- Yes. You went down a path

07:27.676 --> 07:28.792
with the best intentions,

07:28.927 --> 07:30.711
and then it just got
worse and worse

I understand? I do.

But I don't think you
understand that every

07:44.592 --> 07:46.810
other time you screwed up,
it was a mistake,

07:46.945 --> 07:49.063
and this time,
it was a choice!

07:49.197 --> 07:50.230
That's what Harvey said.

07:50.365 --> 07:51.365
Of course
that's what Harvey said.

07:51.483 --> 07:52.733
And just because I get
what happened,

07:52.867 --> 07:54.068
it doesn't mean that you
deserve to be let off the hook,

in here to ask me

07:56.037 --> 07:57.738
to go to him for
the millionth time, I'm--

07:57.872 --> 07:59.239
No, I'm not here for that.

07:59.407 --> 08:01.208
Then--then what
are you here for?

08:01.326 --> 08:05.295
I'm here to ask you
if I'm gonna get fired.

08:05.413 --> 08:06.413
What?

08:06.498 --> 08:07.915
I saw how he looked
at me, Donna.

08:08.083 --> 08:09.416
I know he trusts you,

08:09.584 --> 08:14.505
but I need to know if Harvey's
planning on firing me.

08:14.639 --> 08:16.090
No, Louis.

08:16.174 --> 08:17.558
To my knowledge,

08:17.675 --> 08:22.980
Harvey isn't planning
to fire you.

08:23.131 --> 08:25.983
Thank you, Donna.

08:26.134 --> 08:28.986
I knew I could count on you.

08:37.662 --> 08:39.830
Can't remember the last time
I saw <i>you</i> in here.

08:39.948 --> 08:42.866
I can't remember the last time
this firm faced prosecution.

08:42.984 --> 08:44.952
I can: Ava Hessington.

08:45.086 --> 08:45.953
And after that, we said
it would never come

08:46.121 --> 08:47.121
to this again.

08:47.155 --> 08:48.288
How the hell did it?

08:48.423 --> 08:49.957
We stepped into the ring
with Charles Forstman.

08:50.091 --> 08:52.009
I'm guessing he didn't
budge last night.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.510
He didn't.

08:53.661 --> 08:55.781
He sheltered himself, and
he'd rather laugh in my face

08:55.797 --> 08:59.049
than be 100% protected
against the S.E.C.

08:59.184 --> 09:00.300
You have a plan "B"?

09:00.385 --> 09:01.852
He doesn't, but I do.

09:02.003 --> 09:03.470
What the hell is it?

09:03.605 --> 09:05.305
What would you do
if you were Cahill?

09:05.473 --> 09:07.141
Go through every
one of these boxes,

09:07.275 --> 09:08.475
and start deposing us.

09:08.610 --> 09:10.861
Okay, so what if
while he's doing that,

09:11.012 --> 09:14.615
we start deposing him?

09:18.870 --> 09:20.954
Did you come here to
personally deliver my files?

09:21.039 --> 09:22.906
I came here to
personally deliver this.

09:23.041 --> 09:24.458
Well, if it's an invitation
to your birthday party,

09:24.576 --> 09:26.827
I think I'm busy that day.
That's too bad.

09:26.911 --> 09:29.311
I promised the children a clown.
You've got to be kidding me.

09:29.414 --> 09:31.799
You got Judge Hopkins
to let you start depositions

09:31.916 --> 09:33.436
on your malicious
prosecution bullshit?

09:33.468 --> 09:34.835
He didn't think
it was bullshit,

09:34.969 --> 09:36.290
which is why
he's letting me start

09:36.304 --> 09:37.421
with your boyfriend
Eric Woodall.

09:37.555 --> 09:39.673
You trying to take
my eye off the ball, Harvey?

09:39.808 --> 09:41.058
This is the ball, Sean.

09:41.209 --> 09:44.978
It's a wrecking ball,
and it's headed your way.

09:52.437 --> 09:54.605
Louis, where the hell
have you been?

09:54.739 --> 09:56.523
Those documents are
on their way over.

09:56.658 --> 09:57.908
Katrina, relax.

09:58.026 --> 09:59.493
Relax?

09:59.577 --> 10:01.612
The last time I saw you,
you were worried

10:01.746 --> 10:02.746
about going to prison.

10:02.831 --> 10:04.698
What did you decide to do?

10:04.820 --> 10:05.820
I went to Harvey
and Jessica,

10:05.844 --> 10:06.844
and I told them everything.

10:06.868 --> 10:08.085
What?

10:08.236 --> 10:10.287
Jessica said that
I made a mistake,

10:10.421 --> 10:12.005
and they're working
on a way out.

10:12.123 --> 10:15.425
Louis, have you seen
any mafia movie ever made?

10:15.543 --> 10:17.044
I'm not really
a fan of the genre.

10:17.178 --> 10:18.679
I find it to be a little
offensive to Italians--

10:18.796 --> 10:20.147
Shut up, and listen.

10:20.265 --> 10:23.383
She's telling you to your
face she'll let you live,

10:23.551 --> 10:26.520
but behind your back, she's
making plans to whack you.

10:26.604 --> 10:28.555
Holy shit, I'm living
on borrowed time.

10:28.723 --> 10:30.641
Unless you fix this,
because if you don't,

10:30.758 --> 10:34.061
even if Jessica manages
to keep you out of prison,

10:34.195 --> 10:37.064
she'll be coming
to fire you.

10:42.370 --> 10:44.488
Jessica, I was just thinking

10:44.605 --> 10:46.406
about our dinner plans tonight,

10:46.574 --> 10:47.908
and I think that...

10:48.042 --> 10:49.042
What's wrong?

10:49.160 --> 10:50.494
We're going
after Eric Woodall.

10:50.628 --> 10:54.131
Harvey moved up the time line.

10:54.282 --> 10:56.800
And since this is
Harvey's case now...

10:56.951 --> 10:58.418
Why are you talking to me?

10:58.553 --> 11:01.805
'Cause I need you to find
out every dirty thing

11:01.956 --> 11:06.093
Eric Woodall has ever done,
condoned, or been part of.

11:06.227 --> 11:08.262
Jessica, I really
don't feel comfortable

11:08.429 --> 11:11.098
participating in blackmail
without knowing why.

11:11.266 --> 11:13.267
It's not blackmail,
it's evidence,

11:13.434 --> 11:14.685
and I'll tell you why.

11:14.819 --> 11:16.937
Because malicious prosecution
is easier to prove

11:17.071 --> 11:18.205
when there's a track record.

11:18.339 --> 11:19.940
Yeah, there's only
one problem with that.

11:19.974 --> 11:22.743
You see, just yesterday, we
agreed to hand over our files

11:22.827 --> 11:24.111
because we had nothing to hide,

11:24.279 --> 11:26.446
and now, you want me
to go after the S.E.C.,

11:26.581 --> 11:28.115
which means we do.
Jeff-

11:28.249 --> 11:30.784
Jessica, hide it
from them all you want, okay?

11:30.952 --> 11:32.169
But we talked about this,
and you said

11:32.320 --> 11:34.320
that I shouldn't be treated
like any other partner,

11:34.455 --> 11:36.873
so don't come in here
hiding it from me.

11:37.008 --> 11:38.759
You want a straight answer.

11:38.843 --> 11:40.627
I'll give you a straight answer.

11:40.762 --> 11:43.297
Harvey did not collude
with Mike Ross,

11:43.431 --> 11:45.632
but Sean Cahill doesn't
give a shit about that.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.385
So I need you to do
whatever you have to

11:48.519 --> 11:51.305
and get me something
on these guys.

11:59.498 --> 12:02.333
Hey, how did Cahill
handle our surprise?

12:02.484 --> 12:03.451
Actually, I got
to hand it to him.

12:03.619 --> 12:06.371
He handled it
pretty damn well.

12:06.505 --> 12:07.956
What?
You guys had

12:08.090 --> 12:09.257
your whole
Wonder Twins riff,

12:09.375 --> 12:10.696
and now you're
giving him respect?

12:10.759 --> 12:12.894
What's next: A time share
in the Florida Keys?

12:13.028 --> 12:14.028
Easy, tiger.

12:14.130 --> 12:15.130
Just saying, I got
two words for you:

12:15.264 --> 12:17.515
Bro-Mance.

12:17.666 --> 12:19.968
Before you order us
a gift off our registry,

12:20.069 --> 12:21.219
let me tell you
what he's been up too.

12:21.353 --> 12:24.139
He had Judge Hopkins sign
off on his depositions,

12:24.306 --> 12:27.358
meaning he's coming at us
the same time we go after him.

12:27.509 --> 12:29.310
- We can handle it.
- Can Rachel?

12:29.395 --> 12:31.112
What?

12:31.230 --> 12:32.814
Take a look.

12:32.898 --> 12:34.616
She's first on the list.

12:34.733 --> 12:36.484
And you want me
to tell her it's coming.

12:36.619 --> 12:37.859
I want you
to do more than that.

12:37.870 --> 12:39.120
I want you to prep her.

12:39.238 --> 12:41.539
Harvey,
that's not a good idea.

12:41.690 --> 12:43.374
Yes, it is--you're
the best person for the job.

12:43.492 --> 12:44.876
I am the worst
person for the job.

12:45.027 --> 12:46.027
And you're only saying it

12:46.162 --> 12:47.723
because it makes you
feel uncomfortable.

12:47.830 --> 12:49.710
How do you think Cahill's
gonna make Rachel feel

12:49.715 --> 12:52.750
when he gets her under oath?

13:02.344 --> 13:05.230
Usually, people don't
start by washing their hands.

13:05.347 --> 13:08.266
Usually, people aren't
here to talk about Louis.

13:08.383 --> 13:11.486
- Donna.
- Jessica, he made a mistake.

13:11.604 --> 13:14.689
"Mistake" implies that he
did something by accident.

13:14.857 --> 13:16.441
Louis made a choice.

13:16.575 --> 13:18.136
And you're making
the choice to fire him

13:18.227 --> 13:19.777
when this is over.

13:19.912 --> 13:22.280
And how the hell is that
any of your business?

13:22.414 --> 13:25.450
I just thought if Louis
could help get you out of it--

13:25.567 --> 13:26.701
Help get me out of it?

13:26.835 --> 13:28.286
He's the one
that got me into it.

13:28.420 --> 13:29.420
And if this were Harvey,

13:29.571 --> 13:30.971
you'd let him try
to make up for it.

13:31.006 --> 13:32.290
And if this were Harvey,

13:32.407 --> 13:35.126
I'd have the confidence
that he would.

13:35.261 --> 13:38.046
Jessica,
Louis did all of this

13:38.214 --> 13:40.848
because he is dying
for your approval.

13:40.966 --> 13:42.433
You never have
confidence in him,

13:42.551 --> 13:44.018
and you never treat him
the way you treat Harvey.

13:44.136 --> 13:45.270
So this is my fault?

13:45.420 --> 13:47.272
I'm saying
Harvey's made mistakes,

13:47.389 --> 13:49.440
and you've forgiven him.

13:49.591 --> 13:51.559
I've made mistakes,
and you've forgiven me.

13:51.694 --> 13:54.562
You're right, Donna,
you did make a mistake once,

13:54.730 --> 13:58.616
and I did forgive you,
but first I fired you.

13:58.767 --> 14:00.618
And if you don't back off me
right now,

14:00.769 --> 14:04.572
I will do it again.

14:04.707 --> 14:08.076
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a deposition to get to.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.715
Please state your full name
for the record.

14:13.799 --> 14:15.216
Eric ignatius Woodall.

14:15.334 --> 14:17.719
- Ignatius?
- Like the Saint.

14:17.803 --> 14:18.920
I doubt that.

14:19.088 --> 14:21.089
And how long have you
worked for the S.E.C.?

14:21.257 --> 14:22.257
Two months.

14:22.291 --> 14:23.491
And where were you
before that?

14:23.509 --> 14:25.476
I worked at
the U.S. attorneys' office.

14:25.594 --> 14:28.229
Until I got you fired
for malicious prosecution.

14:28.347 --> 14:29.514
You didn't get me fired.

14:29.631 --> 14:31.766
You slandered me
to a person in power,

14:31.900 --> 14:33.851
which caused me to leave
a job I loved.

14:33.986 --> 14:35.270
To avoid getting fired.

14:35.404 --> 14:37.724
You have no proof of that,
and he has no knowledge of that.

14:37.740 --> 14:41.576
Does he have any knowledge
of his feelings towards me?

14:41.694 --> 14:43.611
I don't have any feelings
for you, Mr. Specter,

14:43.779 --> 14:46.497
and for your information,
I landed on my feet.

14:46.615 --> 14:48.249
Yes, we know,
at the S.E.C.,

14:48.367 --> 14:49.951
but we don't want
to talk about that.

14:50.035 --> 14:52.287
We want to talk
about Jim Pembry.

14:52.371 --> 14:56.124
You don't seem
too comfortable anymore, Eric.

14:56.258 --> 14:58.843
Who's Jim Pembry?

14:58.994 --> 15:00.874
I worked with Jim
at the U.S. attorneys' office.

15:00.996 --> 15:02.597
On the Arthur Cohen
prosecution?

15:02.715 --> 15:04.098
I believe he did
some work for me.

15:04.216 --> 15:05.850
You believe?
You sent him

15:06.001 --> 15:08.720
over 1,200 emails on that case
over four years.

15:08.837 --> 15:10.138
If you say so.

15:10.222 --> 15:11.742
Actually, your
computer records say so,

15:11.857 --> 15:13.308
and I could read them all,

15:13.475 --> 15:15.443
but I'd rather start
with my favorite.

15:15.561 --> 15:17.779
"I don't care what we
get Arthur Cohen on.

15:17.896 --> 15:20.398
"Tax evasion, insider trading,
jaywalking if we have to,

15:20.532 --> 15:22.650
but we're putting that
piece of shit behind bars."

15:22.735 --> 15:23.735
Where the hell
did you get that?

15:23.869 --> 15:25.036
It's not important
where we got it,

15:25.187 --> 15:26.187
but that we got it.

15:26.221 --> 15:27.221
Emails get heated.

15:27.323 --> 15:28.289
It was the middle of a case.

15:28.374 --> 15:29.374
The problem is, Eric,

15:29.408 --> 15:30.992
this was dated
two years before

15:31.126 --> 15:32.160
you even brought
your big case.

15:32.294 --> 15:33.995
- Do you have a question?
- I sure do.

15:34.129 --> 15:35.463
You decide someone's guilty,

15:35.547 --> 15:36.998
then you find the crime
to fit them.

15:37.132 --> 15:38.583
Isn't that true?
No.

15:38.717 --> 15:40.635
You want me to get
you for perjury too?

15:40.719 --> 15:42.503
You tried to get
Arthur on one thing.

15:42.638 --> 15:44.472
Instead, you got him
on another, didn't you?

15:44.590 --> 15:46.057
- Don't answer him.
- Yes.

15:46.208 --> 15:47.925
And that's exactly what you
want to do with me, isn't it?

15:48.043 --> 15:49.083
That's enough.
Stop typing.

15:49.144 --> 15:50.344
We're done here.
[Camera beeps]

15:50.346 --> 15:51.896
- To answer your question...
- Don't--

15:52.047 --> 15:54.732
You're damn right it is.

15:54.883 --> 15:56.651
That's okay.
It may not be on record,

15:56.735 --> 16:00.655
but I got what <i>I</i> wanted.

16:08.614 --> 16:10.198
You're not my usual guy.

16:10.366 --> 16:12.200
I'm not a usual anything.

16:12.334 --> 16:18.206
No, you're not.

16:18.340 --> 16:19.624
Thanks to Jim Pembry.

16:19.758 --> 16:22.009
I'm not here to celebrate
with Jim Pembry.

16:22.127 --> 16:24.212
[Chuckles]

16:24.346 --> 16:25.546
Jessica, we may have
landed the first punch,

16:25.714 --> 16:27.598
but we're next up.

16:27.749 --> 16:29.110
And Cahill's gonna
be brutal on us.

16:29.218 --> 16:31.469
- No, he isn't.
- What do you mean?

16:31.603 --> 16:32.887
We're going to court
tomorrow,

16:32.971 --> 16:34.972
and with any luck, we're
gonna get this whole thing

16:35.107 --> 16:37.392
tossed before he even
has a chance to depose us.

16:37.526 --> 16:39.560
Well, then, maybe
we should go to dinner.

16:39.645 --> 16:41.646
I have a better idea.

16:41.763 --> 16:44.732
Let's order in.

16:53.442 --> 16:55.743
Miss Zane, do you
live with Michael Ross,

16:55.878 --> 16:57.879
the lawyer on the other
side of this takeover?

16:57.996 --> 16:59.630
Yes.

16:59.781 --> 17:01.966
And, uh, and at any point
during the takeover,

17:02.084 --> 17:03.405
did you discuss business
with him?

17:03.469 --> 17:04.469
No.

17:04.470 --> 17:06.521
You expect me
to believe that?

17:06.655 --> 17:07.821
I don't care whether
you believe it or not,

17:07.923 --> 17:09.924
because it's the truth.

17:10.092 --> 17:13.644
The truth.

17:13.795 --> 17:19.599
Did you discuss Logan Sanders
with Mr. Ross?

17:19.768 --> 17:21.569
- Yes.
- I'm confused.

17:21.686 --> 17:23.237
You just said that
you didn't discuss business

17:23.355 --> 17:25.272
with Mr. Ross,
yet now you're saying

17:25.406 --> 17:27.657
that you discussed the man on
the other side of the takeover.

17:27.776 --> 17:29.444
How can one of those be
true and not the other?

17:29.611 --> 17:32.413
- That wasn't about business.
- Then what was it about?

17:32.498 --> 17:35.416
It was about the fact
that I used to be involved

17:35.534 --> 17:38.202
with Logan Sanders.

17:38.337 --> 17:39.787
And did you assure Mr. Ross

17:39.955 --> 17:40.872
that you wouldn't
become involved

17:41.006 --> 17:42.290
with Logan Sanders again?

17:42.458 --> 17:43.424
What does that have
to do with--

17:43.542 --> 17:45.543
- Answer my question.
- Yes, I did.

17:45.677 --> 17:47.278
And yet, over the course
of the takeover,

17:47.296 --> 17:48.846
you did become involved
with him again, didn't you?

17:48.964 --> 17:50.298
No, I didn't.

17:50.432 --> 17:52.266
You had no physical contact
of a sexual nature at all--

17:52.384 --> 17:54.185
- Mike, please, I don't--
- Just answer my question.

17:54.336 --> 17:56.471
We kissed once,
and that was it.

17:56.605 --> 17:59.440
- Did you sleep with him?
- He is not going to ask me--

17:59.525 --> 18:01.142
You just lied.
You said you weren't involved,

18:01.276 --> 18:02.560
and then you said
you kissed him.

18:02.694 --> 18:03.861
So I'm gonna ask you again:

18:04.012 --> 18:05.646
Did you sleep
with Logan Sanders

18:05.781 --> 18:08.032
after you assured the man
that you supposedly love

18:08.183 --> 18:09.744
that you wouldn't
become involved again?

18:09.851 --> 18:11.152
I'm not gonna answer that,

18:11.236 --> 18:13.070
because it doesn't have anything
to do with collusion.

18:13.205 --> 18:14.405
It goes to credibility.
It goes to

18:14.523 --> 18:16.991
what you're capable of,
whether a jury should trust you.

18:17.075 --> 18:18.396
- A jury or you?
- What difference

18:18.410 --> 18:20.044
does that make?
The difference is

18:20.162 --> 18:21.913
you're the one that's doing it,
because <i>you</i> don't trust me.

18:22.047 --> 18:24.582
- Because Harvey needs me to.
- It is vicious, and it's cruel.

18:24.716 --> 18:25.883
- I am doing my job.
- Mike, I thought

18:26.034 --> 18:28.386
you were over this.
Well, I'm goddamn not!

18:36.144 --> 18:39.180
[Whispering]
I didn't sleep with Logan.

18:43.819 --> 18:48.356
I kissed him,
and I hate myself for it.

18:50.559 --> 18:54.028
Mike, I'm so sorry.

18:54.196 --> 18:57.748
And I can apologize to you
every day

18:57.866 --> 18:59.033
for the rest of my life,

18:59.167 --> 19:01.619
but I-I...

19:01.753 --> 19:04.205
I don't know what else to do,

19:04.373 --> 19:07.041
other than
to tell you that...

19:07.175 --> 19:08.459
You mean more to me

19:08.594 --> 19:13.681
than anything in the world,
and I need you to believe me.

19:13.765 --> 19:15.967
I need you to believe me
so that we can move on

19:16.101 --> 19:18.970
and live our lives.

19:23.759 --> 19:27.461
Think that's enough
questions for tonight.

19:37.114 --> 19:38.754
Louis, what the
hell are you doing here?

19:38.815 --> 19:40.583
I read
the Eric Woodall deposition,

19:40.701 --> 19:41.618
and I thought I could help.

19:41.752 --> 19:42.869
Help what?

19:43.003 --> 19:44.443
You're here
to shut down Sean Cahill,

19:44.488 --> 19:45.622
and he's not gonna give up
without a fight.

19:45.706 --> 19:47.040
Louis, I don't
have time for this.

19:47.174 --> 19:48.791
So take your arguments
and get the hell out of here.

19:48.959 --> 19:49.876
Please, Jessica,
I want to help.

19:50.010 --> 19:51.210
I don't need your help.

19:51.345 --> 19:52.795
We're about to put
this thing to bed.

19:52.930 --> 19:55.848
- And I feel responsible.
- You are responsible.

19:55.999 --> 19:57.967
You are the entire
reason we are in jeopardy,

19:58.052 --> 20:01.020
and you want to sit your
stupid face in front of Cahill?

20:01.171 --> 20:04.140
You may as well wear a sign
that says "depose me next."

20:04.275 --> 20:07.477
And if he does that, you will
tumble like a House of Cards,

20:07.611 --> 20:09.479
because you are ruled
by your emotions,

20:09.613 --> 20:12.365
and that is the reason
why we are in this situation

20:12.516 --> 20:15.285
in the first place.

20:15.402 --> 20:16.869
Can I at least sit
in the gallery?

20:17.020 --> 20:18.404
I don't care where you sit,

20:18.539 --> 20:19.789
but Cahill's gonna be here
in 30 seconds,

20:19.873 --> 20:24.160
so it better be
far away from me.

20:24.244 --> 20:25.244
What the hell
is he doing here?

20:25.362 --> 20:26.496
The important thing is

20:26.580 --> 20:29.415
is that he's not sitting
<i>here</i> anymore.

20:31.752 --> 20:34.554
Mr. Cahill, this email
makes a strong case

20:34.705 --> 20:36.055
that Eric Woodall
has a propensity

20:36.206 --> 20:37.423
for malicious prosecution.

20:37.558 --> 20:38.558
Yes, it does, Your Honor,

20:38.592 --> 20:40.226
but I'm the one pursuing
this case,

20:40.377 --> 20:41.728
not Eric Woodall,

20:41.878 --> 20:43.846
and I don't have a propensity
for anything.

20:43.981 --> 20:45.898
I'm a simple man
trying to do my job.

20:46.049 --> 20:48.401
You expect us to believe
that the guy you came up with

20:48.552 --> 20:51.854
at the Department of Justice
comes over to the S.E.C.,

20:51.989 --> 20:54.023
and you immediately
start coming after us,

20:54.108 --> 20:55.491
and it's a coincidence?

20:55.609 --> 20:57.460
Doesn't take much to connect
the dots here, Your Honor.

20:57.594 --> 20:58.861
Well, as long as
we're connecting dots,

20:58.946 --> 21:00.446
I can connect a few too.

21:00.581 --> 21:01.741
Let's start with Jeff Malone.

21:01.782 --> 21:03.199
A man who used to work
at the S.E.C.

21:03.367 --> 21:05.785
Now conveniently works
at Pearson Specter.

21:05.919 --> 21:07.480
It's not against
the law to change jobs.

21:07.571 --> 21:09.255
Yes, but why
did he change jobs?

21:09.406 --> 21:11.124
Because he was instructed
to come after us

21:11.241 --> 21:12.709
on behalf of the S.E.C.

21:12.876 --> 21:13.926
So he says.

21:14.077 --> 21:15.128
I think it's because
he wanted to work

21:15.262 --> 21:18.881
with his girlfriend
Jessica Pearson.

21:19.016 --> 21:20.099
Excuse me?

21:20.217 --> 21:21.434
Ms. Pearson hired Mr. Malone,

21:21.585 --> 21:23.269
because if you're planning
to break some rules,

21:23.387 --> 21:24.854
you need someone
to navigate them for you.

21:24.972 --> 21:26.139
Who better to do that
than your boyfriend

21:26.256 --> 21:27.256
who works at the S.E.C.?

21:27.307 --> 21:28.858
That's ridiculous.

21:28.942 --> 21:30.393
Do you have any proof
of this allegation?

21:30.527 --> 21:33.229
Right here.

21:33.397 --> 21:35.314
I can call you
up to the stand,

21:35.449 --> 21:39.118
or we can do this right now.

21:39.269 --> 21:42.155
Were you seeing Jeff Malone

21:42.272 --> 21:45.975
during the time
that he worked for the S.E.C.?

21:50.464 --> 21:54.083
Please let the record reflect
Ms. Pearson said yes.

21:54.218 --> 21:55.718
Well, a romantic relationship
isn't proof

21:55.803 --> 21:58.337
of a conspiracy,
but it's not irrelevant.

21:58.472 --> 22:00.673
I'll allow you to move
forward with depositions.

22:00.808 --> 22:03.226
[Gavel bangs]

22:03.343 --> 22:04.894
I don't care
what we have to do.

22:05.012 --> 22:06.979
I'm not losing
to that son of a bitch.

22:10.967 --> 22:13.087
Despite what we just proved,
you're not losing to him,

22:13.187 --> 22:14.237
you're losing to me.

22:14.354 --> 22:16.439
And as far
as depositions go,

22:16.607 --> 22:19.442
now it's our turn.

22:28.335 --> 22:30.453
Louis.

22:30.621 --> 22:32.955
Is there something
I can help you with?

22:33.123 --> 22:36.959
I was just thinking
things were so much simpler

22:37.127 --> 22:38.127
when I was in here.

22:38.262 --> 22:40.379
Yeah, Louis...

22:40.497 --> 22:42.632
I know about you and Jessica.

22:42.716 --> 22:43.766
What?

22:43.851 --> 22:46.135
It came out in court.

22:46.220 --> 22:49.439
See, I thought you were
using me to get ahead,

22:49.556 --> 22:52.859
when you really just wanted
to spend more time with Jessica.

22:53.009 --> 22:55.561
What are you doin'
in here, Louis?

22:55.679 --> 22:57.647
I'm here to apologize.

22:57.815 --> 22:59.982
You wanted to be my friend,
and I rejected you

23:00.117 --> 23:03.586
because you were
trying to protect her.

23:03.720 --> 23:07.557
You must've felt so alone.

23:07.658 --> 23:08.758
And believe me,

23:08.892 --> 23:11.661
I know what it's like
to feel alone.

23:11.795 --> 23:14.397
- You're not alone.
- Oh, I am.

23:14.531 --> 23:16.966
Jessica said that I'm
responsible for everything

23:17.101 --> 23:19.719
that's happening,
and she was right.

23:19.837 --> 23:22.421
No one made me make that
dirty deal with Forstman,

23:22.556 --> 23:23.840
and now she won't forgive me.

23:23.974 --> 23:27.143
I'm alone.

23:27.261 --> 23:29.762
And you want me to
talk to her for you.

23:29.897 --> 23:33.516
You're the only
one I can go to, Jeff.

23:33.650 --> 23:37.069
And you're
the closest person she has.

23:38.856 --> 23:40.656
Sure, Louis.

23:40.774 --> 23:43.659
I'll talk to Jessica
for you.

23:49.333 --> 23:50.700
[Knocks on door]

23:50.834 --> 23:51.834
Hey.

23:51.952 --> 23:52.952
Hey.

23:53.069 --> 23:54.309
You're off the hook
with Cahill.

23:54.404 --> 23:57.140
He's gonna start with me
and Harvey in the morning.

23:57.241 --> 23:58.307
Am I?

23:58.408 --> 24:01.277
- Are you what?
- Off the hook.

24:01.411 --> 24:05.348
[Sighs]
Rachel...

24:05.465 --> 24:08.634
I didn't mean
for what happened to happen.

24:08.769 --> 24:11.804
- But it did.
- I know.

24:13.607 --> 24:15.158
- Mike--
- I still haven't gotten

24:15.292 --> 24:17.310
a full night's sleep
since you told me.

24:17.444 --> 24:20.980
I know that you're
not completely over it.

24:23.317 --> 24:25.117
But things are gonna
come up, and I--

24:25.268 --> 24:28.821
Want me to not be
vicious and cruel.

24:28.956 --> 24:31.407
Do you think
that's possible?

24:31.575 --> 24:33.743
I hope so.

24:33.827 --> 24:36.829
I hope so too.

24:38.999 --> 24:41.884
If it means anything,

24:41.969 --> 24:43.586
I haven't gotten
a good night's sleep

24:43.720 --> 24:47.306
since any of this
happened either.

24:47.457 --> 24:50.927
Maybe we can both
give it a shot tonight.

24:59.736 --> 25:01.687
Let's start with one
for you, Mr. Ross.

25:01.822 --> 25:06.609
Were you on good terms
with him when you left?

25:06.743 --> 25:08.611
- Yes.
- Oh.

25:08.745 --> 25:09.946
Well, then, why weren't
you representing him

25:10.030 --> 25:11.747
on the Gillis Industries
takeover?

25:11.865 --> 25:13.115
Because he wasn't
technically our client

25:13.250 --> 25:14.533
at the time.

25:14.668 --> 25:16.035
Well, if you're
on such good terms,

25:16.152 --> 25:17.152
why wasn't he a client?

25:17.170 --> 25:19.872
Because sometimes
brothers fight.

25:19.990 --> 25:22.892
And sometimes
they pretend to fight.

25:23.026 --> 25:24.343
What are you getting at?

25:24.494 --> 25:26.345
I'm getting at the fact
that you supposedly

25:26.496 --> 25:27.713
were fighting when
this thing started,

25:27.848 --> 25:30.349
yet you claim that you
weren't fighting when it ended.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.268
Who says we weren't
fighting when it ended?

25:32.386 --> 25:33.886
You did,
when you hired him back.

25:34.004 --> 25:36.722
Yeah, and the cowboys
signed Deion Sanders,

25:36.857 --> 25:37.773
even though they were rivals.

25:37.891 --> 25:39.141
You want to know why?

25:39.309 --> 25:40.643
'Cause he was awesome,
and they were tired of him

25:40.777 --> 25:42.278
intercepting their passes.

25:42.396 --> 25:44.063
He didn't intercept passes
for you.

25:44.197 --> 25:45.197
He fumbled the ball.

25:45.315 --> 25:46.715
Bullshit. He hit
it out of the park.

25:46.783 --> 25:48.317
What park are
you playing at?

25:48.452 --> 25:51.787
He sides with Walter Gillis,
buys a ton of shares,

25:51.905 --> 25:52.989
then ditches poor Walter,

25:53.123 --> 25:54.573
and then walks away
from the whole thing.

25:54.691 --> 25:56.459
Why would you even want
a guy like this on your team?

25:56.576 --> 25:57.827
What am I missing?

25:57.995 --> 25:59.635
You're missing the fact
that he kicked ass

25:59.663 --> 26:02.548
his first time out, and anybody
would be lucky to have him.

26:02.699 --> 26:04.667
Then why didn't
anybody take him?

26:04.801 --> 26:06.002
What?

26:06.136 --> 26:08.337
I checked with every
major law firm in the city,

26:08.472 --> 26:10.589
and not one of them
received a resume from you.

26:10.724 --> 26:13.309
Why is that?
Because it's clear as day.

26:13.393 --> 26:15.678
You're hiding something,
and I'll tell you what it is.

26:15.812 --> 26:18.064
It's because you always
knew that he was coming back

26:18.214 --> 26:20.733
because you and he were in
this together the whole time.

26:20.851 --> 26:22.985
The problem with your
theory is neither one of us

26:23.103 --> 26:24.737
got a nickel from
this alleged collusion,

26:24.888 --> 26:26.238
and you've got
no proof we did.

26:26.389 --> 26:27.323
Yeah, and you're
never gonna find any,

26:27.441 --> 26:30.443
because it doesn't exist.

26:30.577 --> 26:32.457
So you're both insisting
that neither one of you

26:32.529 --> 26:33.729
got any money?

26:33.864 --> 26:34.864
Damn right.

26:34.865 --> 26:38.167
That tells me
that someone else did.

26:40.370 --> 26:42.505
Thank you, gentlemen.
[Camera beeps]

26:42.622 --> 26:44.863
I believe you showed me where
I should focus my manpower.

26:44.908 --> 26:47.960
Somewhere in those files
there's a payment

26:48.095 --> 26:50.796
from somewhere to someone,
and I'm gonna find it,

26:50.931 --> 26:54.016
because you can't hide
money from the S.E.C.

27:00.461 --> 27:03.013
Son of a bitch.

27:03.979 --> 27:06.113
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Tell you what?

27:06.264 --> 27:08.449
About Louis making
a dirty deal with Forstman.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.951
- He told you.
- He thought I already knew.

27:11.102 --> 27:12.870
He found out
we were together,

27:12.988 --> 27:15.573
and unlike you, he assumed
that people in relationships

27:15.740 --> 27:16.740
share shit like that.

27:16.741 --> 27:18.792
Goddamn ticking time bomb.

27:18.910 --> 27:20.878
Do you hear yourself?

27:20.996 --> 27:23.330
I'm coming to you with
a problem between you and me,

27:23.465 --> 27:25.249
and you're focused on Louis.

27:25.383 --> 27:27.418
I'm focused on Louis
because right now his actions

27:27.552 --> 27:28.752
threaten this entire firm.

27:28.837 --> 27:31.088
Which brings me right
back to where we started.

27:31.223 --> 27:32.544
Why didn't you tell me
about Louis

27:32.624 --> 27:35.726
when I asked you what
the dirt on Woodall was for?

27:35.844 --> 27:38.262
I didn't tell you
because I didn't want you

27:38.396 --> 27:42.433
in the position of having
to lie for me in a deposition.

27:42.567 --> 27:47.571
Is that "focused
on you and me "enough?

27:47.689 --> 27:49.490
Jessica...

27:49.641 --> 27:51.075
When are you gonna understand

27:51.192 --> 27:53.611
that I can handle
crossing lines,

27:53.745 --> 27:55.863
but I won't
handle you lying to me?

27:58.416 --> 27:59.667
Now, how much
trouble are we in?

27:59.817 --> 28:02.786
That's what I'm
gonna find out.

28:07.926 --> 28:09.927
- Louis, did you see this?
- No, what is it?

28:10.045 --> 28:13.631
It's Cahill's deposition
with Harvey and Mike.

28:13.765 --> 28:17.685
Skip to the end.

28:17.835 --> 28:20.437
Jesus Christ, he's honing in
like a bloodhound.

28:20.555 --> 28:22.139
It's only a matter of time.

28:22.307 --> 28:23.807
There's got to be a way
we can get this filed--

28:23.942 --> 28:24.942
There isn't.

28:24.976 --> 28:26.977
- Louis.
- I'm done.

28:28.947 --> 28:30.648
[Laughs]

28:30.782 --> 28:33.150
I'm done.

28:35.320 --> 28:36.704
And if I don't
do something now,

28:36.821 --> 28:39.406
so are Harvey and Mike.

28:39.541 --> 28:42.793
- Where are you going?
- To finish what I started.

28:42.877 --> 28:44.161
- You know what I think?
- What?

28:44.329 --> 28:45.829
I think we both could've
used a better lawyer

28:45.997 --> 28:47.214
in that deposition.

28:47.365 --> 28:49.383
- You think this is funny?
- No, I don't.

28:49.534 --> 28:50.918
Then help me
figure a way out,

28:51.052 --> 28:53.671
because if we don't, they're
gonna find out about Louis,

28:53.755 --> 28:55.839
and everything Cahill's
been saying about us

28:56.007 --> 28:57.775
is gonna start looking true.

28:57.909 --> 29:00.029
We have to stop Cahill from
going through those files.

29:00.044 --> 29:01.605
- We tried that.
- We have to try again.

29:01.680 --> 29:04.181
We have to prove that Cahill
is only on this investigation

29:04.316 --> 29:05.649
because Woodall hates <i>you.</i>

29:05.767 --> 29:08.519
The problem is we don't
have a link between them.

29:08.687 --> 29:10.604
And they have a link
between Jessica and Malone.

29:10.739 --> 29:13.073
So we'd have to convince
Judge Hopkins

29:13.224 --> 29:16.026
their relationship has nothing
to do with this whole thing,

29:16.111 --> 29:19.196
which...
We'll never be able to do.

29:19.280 --> 29:21.332
How do they even know
about Jessica and Malone?

29:21.416 --> 29:23.617
I don't know.
Someone at the S.E.C. must've

29:23.735 --> 29:25.502
seen them together while
Malone was still working there.

29:25.620 --> 29:26.941
You think
they were holding hands?

29:26.955 --> 29:28.789
Come on, Harvey, this is
Jessica we're talking about.

29:28.923 --> 29:30.541
Talking about me, what?

29:30.675 --> 29:31.959
Holy shit, you're right.

29:32.076 --> 29:34.345
She was married,
and I didn't even know it.

29:34.429 --> 29:36.380
Cahill had us followed
without authorization.

29:36.514 --> 29:37.765
And there's no way
he had authorization

29:37.882 --> 29:40.050
to follow a government official.

29:40.185 --> 29:41.468
You need to pay
that man a visit.

29:41.586 --> 29:44.188
<i>I</i> need to pay
that man a visit.

29:46.641 --> 29:47.858
[Knocks on door]

29:47.976 --> 29:50.611
Yep.

29:50.762 --> 29:51.895
Oh, sorry, maybe you
didn't hear the news.

29:52.063 --> 29:53.814
Jeff Malone doesn't
work here anymore.

29:53.948 --> 29:55.232
And I'm guessing you know
exactly where he is,

29:55.400 --> 29:57.080
since you've been
following him for months.

29:57.101 --> 29:58.501
I haven't been
following him at all.

29:58.570 --> 29:59.837
I've been following you.

29:59.971 --> 30:01.505
Well, it doesn't really
matter who you followed,

30:01.639 --> 30:03.841
since there's no way
you got authorization.

30:03.975 --> 30:05.826
You think Judge Hopkins
is going to look into

30:05.943 --> 30:07.294
those dreamy brown eyes of yours

30:07.445 --> 30:09.046
and drop the case
because of that?

30:09.164 --> 30:11.415
No, I think
you're gonna drop it.

30:11.583 --> 30:13.467
- Hmm.
- 'Cause if you don't,

30:13.618 --> 30:15.469
it's no longer
malicious prosecution.

30:15.620 --> 30:17.054
It's abuse of power.

30:17.138 --> 30:19.423
You did it to Mike Ross,
you did it to me,

30:19.557 --> 30:21.508
and we're gonna find out
who else you did it to.

30:21.643 --> 30:22.760
Take a shot.

30:22.844 --> 30:24.144
It'll take you two years
to make a case,

30:24.295 --> 30:26.480
and even if it sticks,
I'll get a slap on the wrist,

30:26.631 --> 30:29.266
but Harvey Specter
will already be in prison.

30:29.401 --> 30:30.601
You dirty son of a bitch.

30:30.685 --> 30:32.486
Dirty?

30:32.637 --> 30:33.771
I may bend the rules,

30:33.905 --> 30:35.739
but I'm doing it
because you are guilty.

30:35.824 --> 30:37.274
That's exactly
what Eric Woodall said

30:37.442 --> 30:39.276
before we got his ass fired.

30:39.411 --> 30:40.694
Well, I'll tell you
what I told Harvey.

30:40.829 --> 30:42.112
I'm not Eric Woodall,

30:42.247 --> 30:43.687
and sending
some guy named Louis Litt

30:43.782 --> 30:45.833
to confess to some
fabricated bullshit

30:45.983 --> 30:47.868
isn't gonna make me stop.

30:48.002 --> 30:50.871
It's gonna make me
come at you harder.

30:57.512 --> 31:01.131
Maybe no news is good news.

31:01.266 --> 31:02.827
All right, maybe
no news means bad news.

31:02.884 --> 31:04.134
[Soft thud]

31:04.269 --> 31:07.137
When it comes to Jessica,
no news is no news.

31:07.272 --> 31:09.106
Harvey, you have a minute?

31:09.224 --> 31:10.774
What do you want, Louis?

31:10.859 --> 31:12.526
I'd prefer to tell you alone.

31:12.644 --> 31:14.945
Mike knows everything,
so spit it out.

31:15.029 --> 31:17.481
Okay, um, but I think
you both should know

31:17.615 --> 31:19.149
that whatever happens to me,

31:19.234 --> 31:21.819
I had the dignity to come to you
and tell you like a man.

31:21.953 --> 31:23.370
- What did you do?
- He did exactly

31:23.521 --> 31:24.955
what I told him not to do.

31:25.073 --> 31:27.124
He went to the S.E.C.,
and he confessed.

31:27.208 --> 31:28.208
Wait, Jessica, please.

31:28.359 --> 31:29.910
Please what?
Don't kill you?

31:30.044 --> 31:31.712
Because one thing
is for sure.

31:31.830 --> 31:34.465
When all this is over, I'm gonna
fire the shit out of you.

31:34.582 --> 31:36.667
Fire me?

31:36.801 --> 31:38.001
You should be thanking me.

31:38.169 --> 31:39.586
I read the transcript.

31:39.721 --> 31:42.055
Cahill knows
about the hidden payment.

31:42.206 --> 31:44.174
I went there
to save all of you!

31:44.309 --> 31:46.760
And I told you
the second you did that,

31:46.878 --> 31:49.012
these two go from being
probably innocent

31:49.147 --> 31:50.681
to definitely guilty.

31:50.815 --> 31:53.517
- Goddamn idiot.
- Wait a second. We--

31:53.651 --> 31:56.019
Louis, if you confessed,
then why are you here?

31:56.187 --> 31:58.071
- They sent me home.
- What?

31:58.222 --> 31:59.356
What exactly did you
say to Cahill?

31:59.491 --> 32:00.491
I didn't talk to Cahill.

32:00.492 --> 32:02.025
I mean, I was in his office,

32:02.110 --> 32:04.411
but then Eric Woodall comes in,
takes me down the hall.

32:04.562 --> 32:05.562
I confessed to him.

32:05.580 --> 32:07.664
You told
the head of the S.E.C.

32:07.782 --> 32:09.750
you committed a federal crime,
and he sent you on your way?

32:09.901 --> 32:11.118
- Yes.
- And he didn't try to get you

32:11.252 --> 32:12.836
to implicate Harvey?
No, in fact,

32:12.954 --> 32:14.371
he didn't seem to care at all.

32:14.455 --> 32:16.815
And you specifically told him
about your deal with Forstman?

32:16.908 --> 32:18.475
Yeah. He said
they're not interested

32:18.576 --> 32:19.710
in little fish like me.

32:19.844 --> 32:20.928
You might be
a little fish to him,

32:21.078 --> 32:23.046
but Forstman
is a goddamn whale.

32:23.181 --> 32:24.214
It doesn't matter.

32:24.382 --> 32:25.902
Woodall hates me:
I'm the one he wants.

32:26.017 --> 32:28.468
But why not use Forstman
to reel you in

32:28.603 --> 32:30.304
and get two
for the price of one?

32:30.421 --> 32:31.638
Unless for some reason

32:31.773 --> 32:35.025
Woodall doesn't want to drag
Forstman into this.

32:35.159 --> 32:37.261
Because
they're in bed together.

32:37.395 --> 32:39.129
That's a big leap.

32:39.264 --> 32:40.230
Harvey, you said
you told Forstman

32:40.365 --> 32:41.598
the S.E.C. was on his ass,
and he acted

32:41.733 --> 32:43.267
like he was wearing
a teflon suit.

32:43.401 --> 32:44.835
He acted
the same way with me.

32:44.969 --> 32:46.870
And when assholes
act invincible,

32:47.005 --> 32:48.639
it's because
they think they are.

32:48.740 --> 32:50.657
It's the only
thing that makes sense.

32:50.775 --> 32:52.626
You two find the link
between those two,

32:52.777 --> 32:55.712
and find it tonight.

33:08.664 --> 33:10.532
This could be something.

33:10.666 --> 33:12.500
Look.

33:12.618 --> 33:14.702
In April of last year,

33:14.870 --> 33:17.088
Charles Forstman made huge
contributions

33:17.206 --> 33:20.008
to these three senators.

33:20.125 --> 33:22.143
So what?
He's got money to burn.

33:22.278 --> 33:23.628
Yeah, but four weeks later,

33:23.762 --> 33:25.096
these same senators
helped appoint Eric Woodall

33:25.247 --> 33:27.098
to head the New York office
of the S.E.C.

33:27.249 --> 33:28.489
That doesn't prove
a direct link

33:28.551 --> 33:30.101
between Forstman and Woodall.

33:30.252 --> 33:32.687
- It's still a link, Harvey.
- And it's how this shit works.

33:32.805 --> 33:34.889
It's totally legal, and it's
not gonna do a thing for us.

33:35.024 --> 33:36.024
Well, what do you want?

33:36.108 --> 33:37.988
A picture of him handing Woodall
a bag of money?

33:38.110 --> 33:39.143
Because we're never
gonna get that.

33:39.278 --> 33:41.446
Maybe we don't need it.

33:41.597 --> 33:44.482
You better be here
with something good.

33:48.203 --> 33:50.538
[Softly]
I am.

33:50.656 --> 33:52.790
Charles Forstman made me take
a million dollars

33:52.941 --> 33:54.242
to keep from turning on him.

33:54.326 --> 33:56.878
What if he made Woodall
take a taste too?

33:56.996 --> 33:58.379
You think we
don't know that?

33:58.497 --> 33:59.847
That's the "bag of money"
problem.

33:59.949 --> 34:01.109
It wouldn't be
a bag of money,

34:01.183 --> 34:02.304
because if it's untraceable,

34:02.418 --> 34:03.685
he wouldn't have leverage
over Woodall.

34:03.786 --> 34:05.637
That's great,
but we can't get access

34:05.787 --> 34:06.868
to Woodall's bank accounts.

34:06.922 --> 34:08.255
We can't.

34:08.389 --> 34:09.556
But Cahill can.

34:09.675 --> 34:11.175
Okay, what good
does that do us, huh?

34:11.310 --> 34:15.313
They're together.
What if they're not?

34:15.464 --> 34:17.565
I told you,
I went to see Cahill.

34:17.650 --> 34:19.100
He wasn't there.

34:19.234 --> 34:21.018
Five minutes later,
Eric Woodall shows up.

34:21.136 --> 34:22.704
I say two words:
"Charles Forstman."

34:22.838 --> 34:24.438
He hustles me outta there
like I'm his mistress

34:24.572 --> 34:26.107
with his wife
coming up the driveway.

34:26.241 --> 34:29.110
Why would he not wait
for Cahill?

34:29.244 --> 34:31.779
You want us to get Cahill
to turn on Woodall.

34:31.914 --> 34:34.782
- Wouldn't you?
- Maybe Louis is right.

34:34.917 --> 34:36.784
Maybe there are lines that
Woodall's willing to cross

34:36.952 --> 34:37.952
that Cahill won't.

34:37.985 --> 34:39.286
That's a big "maybe."

34:39.420 --> 34:41.289
You have a better idea?

34:41.422 --> 34:43.958
No, I don't.

34:44.092 --> 34:45.927
Look, guys, we all know

34:46.045 --> 34:49.514
that Jessica's gonna
fire me after this.

34:49.665 --> 34:51.549
I just want to help,

34:51.684 --> 34:53.717
make things right.

34:56.221 --> 34:57.855
Get your coat.

34:58.006 --> 34:59.107
[Pen clatters]

35:05.481 --> 35:08.149
You really looking through
those all by yourself?

35:08.317 --> 35:09.817
Are the Witches of Eastwick
here to tell me

35:09.985 --> 35:11.653
how to run my department?

35:11.820 --> 35:13.237
We're here to make
things easier for you.

35:13.372 --> 35:14.489
Oh.

35:14.657 --> 35:18.376
Buried in one of these boxes
is a copy of this.

35:18.527 --> 35:19.661
It proves collusion.

35:19.795 --> 35:21.295
Not between me and Mike.

35:21.413 --> 35:24.499
Between him
and Charles Forstman.

35:24.633 --> 35:25.967
And you're just
gonna give this to me?

35:26.085 --> 35:27.085
Yup.

35:27.169 --> 35:28.086
And you're gonna
give it to Woodall,

35:28.203 --> 35:29.637
and we're gonna
see what he says.

35:29.755 --> 35:31.639
And what he's gonna say is
that he doesn't give a shit

35:31.724 --> 35:32.840
about Charles Forstman,

35:33.008 --> 35:34.509
just like he told me
when I confessed to him.

35:34.677 --> 35:35.893
What exactly
are you implying?

35:36.044 --> 35:37.261
We're not implying anything.

35:37.379 --> 35:39.339
We're telling you that
after Woodall lost his job,

35:39.348 --> 35:41.516
Forstman got him installed
at the S.E.C.,

35:41.650 --> 35:44.352
and all he had to do
in return was protect Forstman.

35:44.486 --> 35:45.486
Where's the proof?

35:45.571 --> 35:47.105
In Eric Woodall's
bank accounts.

35:47.239 --> 35:49.273
Oh, so you want me to go
through his bank accounts

35:49.408 --> 35:50.692
based on your word.

35:50.859 --> 35:52.527
You followed us
based on his bullshit.

35:52.661 --> 35:53.895
Based on the word
of my friend.

35:53.996 --> 35:55.563
Why don't you ask your
friend if he has a problem

35:55.698 --> 35:57.198
giving you access
to his accounts?

35:57.299 --> 35:58.566
If he doesn't,
then we're wrong,

35:58.701 --> 36:00.635
and we've just handed you
the smoking gun.

36:00.769 --> 36:02.620
And if you're right,
you want me to let him

36:02.755 --> 36:04.205
off the hook for what he did.

36:04.339 --> 36:06.374
Woodall already
said he's a little fish.

36:06.508 --> 36:08.926
We're asking you to
throw him back in the water.

36:09.077 --> 36:10.128
What the hell's
going on in here?

36:10.262 --> 36:11.262
Hey, Eric.

36:11.296 --> 36:12.463
It's good
to see you again.

36:12.598 --> 36:13.848
Sean, isn't this great
that we're all together?

36:13.932 --> 36:15.850
Did you see me come in?

36:15.934 --> 36:17.101
Afraid of what I'd say?

36:17.252 --> 36:19.470
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

36:19.588 --> 36:20.638
Eric, these gentlemen
came in here

36:20.773 --> 36:22.273
with these wild accusations

36:22.424 --> 36:24.609
that you and Charles Forstman
are in bed together.

36:24.760 --> 36:28.196
A bed filled
with Forstman's money.

36:28.280 --> 36:30.898
Yes, Charles Forstman
gave me millions of dollars.

36:31.066 --> 36:32.650
That's why I drive a Subaru.

36:32.785 --> 36:34.705
Yeah, I didn't spend
the money he gave me either.

36:34.770 --> 36:36.237
That doesn't mean he
didn't make me take it.

36:36.371 --> 36:38.289
I don't give a shit.
I'm not you.

36:38.407 --> 36:40.127
Eric, obviously these
allegations are crazy.

36:40.275 --> 36:42.043
Of course they are.

36:42.161 --> 36:44.412
So just...

36:44.546 --> 36:47.749
Prove it to 'em
you've got nothing to hide.

36:51.620 --> 36:52.720
This is ridiculous.

36:52.838 --> 36:56.090

give me a minute.

Yep.

he means 10 to 15 years.

In about a half an hour,
you're gonna need

a really good lawyer.

37:17.162 --> 37:19.447
And when that happens,

37:19.581 --> 37:23.167
don't call me.

37:33.595 --> 37:35.196
Which lawyer do you
think Woodall called?

37:35.214 --> 37:37.098
Well, if he was smart,
he would call Daniel Hardman.

37:37.216 --> 37:39.600
The best person to defend
a criminal is a criminal.

37:39.718 --> 37:42.136
And Hardman's a much better
lawyer than you anyways.

Oh, very funny.

37:44.690 --> 37:46.224
Thank you.

Thank you, Louis.

Please.

38:00.906 --> 38:02.290
I'll try.

Donna told me she
already said this to you,

38:11.583 --> 38:14.502
but I want you to
hear it from me.

38:14.586 --> 38:18.923
I wouldn't be back here
if it wasn't for Louis.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.926
I'll take care of it.

38:28.550 --> 38:31.819

Harvey, I've already
made up my mind.

38:37.092 --> 38:40.027
You weren't there.
He helped get us out of this.

38:40.162 --> 38:41.629
After he put us
goddamn in it.

38:41.763 --> 38:43.564
And I put us in it
just as much,

38:43.699 --> 38:45.032
the day I hired Mike Ross.

38:45.167 --> 38:47.201
Are you looking
to save Louis,

38:47.369 --> 38:49.036
or to get yourself fired too?

38:49.121 --> 38:50.955
I'm saying he
did some bad shit,

38:51.089 --> 38:53.541
but so have I,
and so have you.

38:53.709 --> 38:55.843
You and I
don't mess shit up.

38:55.961 --> 38:57.044
We fix it.

38:57.179 --> 38:58.296
Which is what he did today.

38:58.430 --> 38:59.981
You want to talk
about what he did?

39:00.115 --> 39:03.050
I told him not to confess,
and he went straight down

39:03.185 --> 39:05.386
to the S.E.C.,
and he sang like a canary,

39:05.554 --> 39:07.889
after he did the same
thing with Jeff Malone.

39:07.973 --> 39:09.213
- That doesn't--
- Doesn't what?

39:09.291 --> 39:11.792
That's just the tip
of the iceberg.

39:11.894 --> 39:14.428
Let's talk about
his greatest hits.

39:14.563 --> 39:17.665
Last year, he blew up
our merger negotiations

39:17.799 --> 39:19.533
because of a cat.

39:19.668 --> 39:23.571
This year, he led Mike Ross
straight to Charles Forstman.

39:23.705 --> 39:25.986
He unwound the Wexler shares
after I specifically told him

39:26.074 --> 39:28.492
not to,
and to top it all off,

39:28.610 --> 39:31.412
he took a million-dollar
payout to commit tax fraud

39:31.580 --> 39:34.215
that could've landed
you ten years in jail.

39:34.333 --> 39:36.717
And he didn't tell us about
that until it was too late,

39:36.835 --> 39:39.086
and he only did that
because he had to.

39:39.221 --> 39:40.554
I'm still not doin' it.

39:40.672 --> 39:41.806
I tell him to do something,

39:41.957 --> 39:45.593
and he never goddamn does it.

39:45.727 --> 39:48.763
Now, I told myself
I'm gonna do something.

39:48.931 --> 39:51.766
And I'm gonna goddamn do it.

39:55.604 --> 39:57.571
Then let me do it.

[Sighs]

40:02.160 --> 40:03.444
Why you and not me?

40:03.578 --> 40:05.863

to deliver the message

40:05.998 --> 40:08.666
"his services
are no longer needed,"

40:08.817 --> 40:10.584
and I want to tell him
"good-bye."

[Louis narrating]
Dear Harvey and Jessica,

40:47.456 --> 40:48.990
there comes a time

40:49.074 --> 40:50.958
when a man must
look at himself in the mirror,

40:51.043 --> 40:52.626
to judge himself

40:52.744 --> 40:55.830
instead of waiting
to be judged by others.

40:55.998 --> 40:59.500
And for me,
that time is now.

40:59.668 --> 41:01.552
You both know
I came to Pearson Specter

41:01.670 --> 41:04.221
right out of law school,
but what you may not know is

41:04.372 --> 41:07.508
this is the only place
I've ever worked.

41:07.642 --> 41:11.345
It's the only place
I've ever wanted to work.

41:11.480 --> 41:13.814
It is my life...

41:13.899 --> 41:16.484
It is my home...

41:16.601 --> 41:20.321
And the people that work here
are my family.

41:20.405 --> 41:22.323
You're like my parents.

41:22.441 --> 41:24.575
And the partners,
they're like my brothers,

41:24.726 --> 41:27.745
and associates under my care
are like my children.

41:27.863 --> 41:29.697
And I'm ashamed
to admit it, but...

41:29.865 --> 41:33.250
I put all of you in jeopardy
for my own personal gain.

41:33.401 --> 41:35.202
I told myself
it was for the greater good,

41:35.337 --> 41:37.171
but the truth is
I just wanted to feel

41:37.289 --> 41:40.841

as both of you, I...

41:40.959 --> 41:42.877
