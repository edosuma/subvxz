14:17.416 --> 14:19.083
Yes, yes!

14:34.458 --> 14:36.125
If it's a problem...

14:37.041 --> 14:38.708
maybe I can help.

14:40.291 --> 14:42.125
If you feel like sharing.

14:56.125 --> 14:58.291
Maybe we should all do some sharing.

23:51.916 --> 23:53.375
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

23:54.500 --> 23:55.375
Cheers.

26:37.166 --> 26:41.916
-You can trust me, I control it now.
-But I don't.

26:42.416 --> 26:44.708
Please, Sigrid.

26:49.708 --> 26:52.958
Runa, I am so, so sorry.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.708
Okay, come on then.

27:31.750 --> 27:32.708
Yes, come on!

27:47.875 --> 27:51.500
A swim? That's not very wise.
We're a bit tipsy.

30:54.541 --> 30:55.875
I feel better now.

30:56.541 --> 30:58.875
You should have trusted me,
like I trusted you.

31:00.208 --> 31:02.875
I feel better now... Better now.

31:04.625 --> 31:07.250
You should have trusted me,
like I trusted you.

34:37.291 --> 34:38.583
You see...

34:40.000 --> 34:41.750
You are wrong, Elena.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.208
I'm a mother, too.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.083
I promise, I'll never forget.

35:35.541 --> 35:36.416
Yes.

41:37.666 --> 41:40.916
Come on, dear. It's not far now.

41:41.416 --> 41:44.083
It's so far away, mom.

41:45.375 --> 41:46.708
From everything.

41:53.875 --> 41:54.833
Mom.

41:57.833 --> 42:02.625
Yes, it is far away, but we are safe here.

42:04.416 --> 42:05.875
At last.

42:07.125 --> 42:08.458
Remember?

42:15.000 --> 42:15.916
Come.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
