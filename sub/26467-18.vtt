00:02.600 --> 00:06.116
<i>My name is Barry Allen and
I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.200 --> 00:09.193
<i>To the outside world I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist.</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:12.313
<i>But secretly with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs</i>

00:12.400 --> 00:15.279
<i>I fight crime and find other
meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.360 --> 00:17.556
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help,</i>

00:17.640 --> 00:18.676
<i>she changed the present.</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:22.475
<i>And now our world is more
dangerous than ever.</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.870
<i>And I'm the only one fast
enough to save it.</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:28.277
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

00:28.360 --> 00:29.953
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:30.040 --> 00:32.794
Follow my instructions
and we'll defeat Cicada.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.872
Destroy his dagger
and save your father.

00:34.960 --> 00:37.953
That is a new timeline
struggling to break through.

00:38.040 --> 00:41.112
<i>Thawne,
another Cicada showed up.</i>

00:42.760 --> 00:44.717
I used to think
that keeping secrets

00:44.800 --> 00:46.776
from people would protect them,
but you can't really

00:46.800 --> 00:48.439
know someone with
walls between you.

00:48.520 --> 00:50.671
Eobard Thawne,
the Reverse Flash.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.433
Your partner.
Your secret.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.952
Dad, I'm sorry I lied to you!

00:57.040 --> 00:58.679
So am I.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.874
<i>Dad, please.
I wanted to tell you.</i>

01:04.000 --> 01:08.153
<i>Dad! I tried to tell you.
I'm sorry I lied to you!</i>

01:08.240 --> 01:11.312
<i>- It's Nora, our daughter.
- She lied to us, Iris.</i>

01:13.360 --> 01:14.919
Since the first day
she got here,

01:15.000 --> 01:16.514
about Thawne!

01:19.640 --> 01:22.838
She knows what he did to us.
To me.

01:22.920 --> 01:24.400
To my mother.

01:24.520 --> 01:26.034
I can't believe
a word she says.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.634
- We don't know that.
- Yes, we do!

01:27.720 --> 01:29.996
We don't even know why
she's working with him.

01:30.080 --> 01:33.869
Well, the pressing question
is not why Nora is working

01:33.960 --> 01:35.553
<i>with the Reverse Flash.</i>

01:35.640 --> 01:39.520
Maybe I can talk to her and
shed some light on the matter.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.354
I think you've
shed enough light.

01:42.440 --> 01:44.636
Why, are you upset at me?
What I should do?

01:44.720 --> 01:46.336
I should just... I should not
have told you?

01:46.360 --> 01:48.511
How long has it been
since you suspected her?

01:48.600 --> 01:49.670
Since I arrived.

01:53.160 --> 01:54.160
Wow.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.856
So you've been following
this trail all this time

01:55.880 --> 01:58.156
and you didn't think to tell
us about it until now?

01:58.240 --> 02:00.232
I don't know where
this trail leads.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.199
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm not kidding you.

02:03.280 --> 02:05.715
You don't come to a conclusion
without facts.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.154
All the facts.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.991
Shirley, I think, uh,
maybe you should just give us

02:13.080 --> 02:15.436
all a minute here.

02:15.520 --> 02:16.960
What, you're mad at me
for doing what

02:17.040 --> 02:18.440
a master detective does.

02:18.520 --> 02:19.960
Figure out something
that you cannot.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.993
I give you that translation.
Your anger is misplaced.

02:23.120 --> 02:27.717
Look, whatever reason
Nora didn't tell us,

02:27.800 --> 02:29.792
I don't think
she did it maliciously.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.239
Guys, even from here,
I can feel how upset she is.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.039
All right, babe,
you've been around Nora

02:36.120 --> 02:37.190
for months.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.296
You never felt that she
was hiding something before.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.313
No, never.
Never.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.916
Well, Thawne lied.
He was a master at it.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.957
It stands to reason he must
have taught Nora some

02:48.040 --> 02:49.872
- of his same tricks.
- Maybe.

02:49.960 --> 02:51.952
Maybe not.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.656
There's gotta be some way
to figure it out.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.480
There is.

03:01.680 --> 03:02.776
I'm guessing this
has everything

03:02.800 --> 03:04.951
from the day she arrived.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.554
<i>Maybe before.</i>

03:15.120 --> 03:16.634
Read it.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.439
From the beginning.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.416
<i>Please stand back
from the perimeter.</i>

03:25.440 --> 03:26.794
<i>Excuse me. Sorry.</i>

03:26.880 --> 03:29.031
Uh, excuse me.
Excuse me, pardon me.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.856
<i>- Incoming call from Mom.</i>
- Mom, come on.

03:30.880 --> 03:32.872
Ooh!
I'm so sorry.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.155
I just... I'm really late.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.072
I'm... I'm really late
for an important date.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.436
Not a date, date.
Not that I don't date, date.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.239
I date, date.
It's just, I have a meeting.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.357
I'm making myself later.
Sorry.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.917
Anyone seen CSI?

03:46.000 --> 03:47.096
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:47.120 --> 03:48.349
Where is West-Allen?

03:48.440 --> 03:50.113
Ah, I'm so sorry,
Detective Curtis.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.429
I didn't mean to be late.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.256
I tried to hail a hover-taxi
but they kept passing me by

03:53.280 --> 03:54.416
and then I had to run
all the way from...

03:54.440 --> 03:55.320
I really don't care what

03:55.321 --> 03:56.760
your reason is this time,
West-Allen.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.917
I just wanna find
what meta did this.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.878
Of course.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.794
Chemical transport truck
on its way to Dayton Labs

04:03.880 --> 04:05.678
<i>was attacked
earlier this morning.</i>

04:05.760 --> 04:09.436
But that makes two labs
and another two transports

04:09.560 --> 04:10.755
this week.

04:10.840 --> 04:13.036
And like the others,
no one saw anyone.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.560
God, there's
residue everywhere.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.995
<i>- Benzene Methanol.</i>
- That's what they stole.

04:21.079 --> 04:22.150
What's that used for?

04:22.680 --> 04:25.479
Anything from nanotech
to treating lice.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.120
<i>- Halothane.</i>
- Halothane?

04:29.440 --> 04:31.238
Wait a second.

04:31.320 --> 04:32.320
What?

04:34.560 --> 04:38.315
This truck has an
Affinity 4,000 security camera.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.357
God, Lia's gonna be so jealous.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.079
Whenever the 4,000's
tampered with,

04:42.160 --> 04:45.551
its failsafe releases
a incapacitating agent.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.194
Halothane.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.431
So you're saying whoever
did this picked the lock,

04:49.520 --> 04:50.556
disabled the camera,

04:50.640 --> 04:53.200
and stole might-be-lice
medicine?

04:53.280 --> 04:56.079
All before this incapacitating
agent could do its job?

04:56.160 --> 04:58.675
And no one saw them.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.353
How is that possible?

05:05.040 --> 05:06.394
<i>A speedster?</i>

05:06.480 --> 05:08.836
Nora, labmate,
friend of mine,

05:08.920 --> 05:10.736
you didn't happen to pitch
your speedster theory

05:10.760 --> 05:12.319
to Detective Curtis, did you?

05:12.400 --> 05:15.757
It is not a theory, Lia.
It is the only explanation.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.276
You know I'm equally a fan

05:18.360 --> 05:19.680
of our fleet-footed
super friends.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.552
I mean, honestly,
if I could have ever

05:21.640 --> 05:23.757
met Jesse Quick, it's like,
hello, new best friend.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.720
- No offense, um...
- Some taken.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.960
Okay, but there hasn't been
a speedster in Central City

05:30.000 --> 05:32.037
since that Crisis piece
your mom wrote about, like,

05:32.120 --> 05:33.190
decades ago.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.317
I mean, Flash, Kid Flash,
Jay Garrick,

05:35.400 --> 05:36.736
that... that weird purple
speedster that just

05:36.760 --> 05:39.958
showed up one day.
They're all gone.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.431
So what you're suggesting,
highly unlikely.

05:43.520 --> 05:44.720
Then we need
to start believing

05:44.760 --> 05:46.319
in the highly unlikely.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.710
Alternatively, um,
you could...

05:50.080 --> 05:51.480
Dial back your obsessiveness.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.960
I'm not obsessive.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.594
You never got
to know your dad.

05:54.680 --> 05:56.990
So you became a CSI
just like him,

05:57.080 --> 06:00.596
and it's why you keep
investigating the one case

06:00.680 --> 06:02.592
Barry Allen never solved.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.160
Cicada.

06:04.240 --> 06:07.950
You call that obsessive.
I call that a hobby.

06:08.040 --> 06:12.239
Right, your, um... your classic
everyday...

06:12.320 --> 06:13.390
murder hobby.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.551
It's like your mom says.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.792
You're, uh... you're excessive.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.236
Do not quote my mother.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.976
God, I wish CCPD would
spring for one

06:24.000 --> 06:25.434
of these Affinity cameras.

06:25.520 --> 06:28.080
I mean, trillion FPS,
captures light in motion.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.720
W-T-Shrap?

06:30.800 --> 06:33.918
- That's lightning.
- The canister's gone.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.595
White lightning.
A speedster.

06:36.680 --> 06:38.990
- Okay, maybe.
- No, not maybe.

06:39.080 --> 06:40.230
It is! I knew it!

06:40.320 --> 06:41.834
Okay, fine, you're right.
But...

06:43.040 --> 06:45.032
But what is a speedster
doing stealing chemicals?

06:47.760 --> 06:51.515
<i>And Eobard Thawne,
aka the Reverse-Flash,</i>

06:51.600 --> 06:53.512
<i>was finally defeated
and incarcerated</i>

06:53.640 --> 06:55.597
<i>and will remain in Iron
Heights Prison</i>

06:55.680 --> 06:59.594
<i>- for the rest of his days.</i>
- I know.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.991
<i>Incoming call from Mom.</i>

07:07.280 --> 07:09.317
See? I knew it.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.915
There was never a speedster
with white lightning.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.237
- All yours.
- Thanks.

07:15.320 --> 07:18.518
<i>Thank you for visiting
the Flash Museum today.</i>

07:18.600 --> 07:20.637
<i>The building will be closing
in five minutes.</i>

07:20.720 --> 07:23.474
<i>All guests should make their
way to the exit now.</i>

07:23.560 --> 07:26.200
<i>And Nora West-Allen,
your mother called.</i>

07:26.280 --> 07:27.999
<i>Please,
for your sake and mine,</i>

07:28.080 --> 07:29.639
<i>call her back.</i>

07:31.920 --> 07:33.912
So embarrassing.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.959
Mom, why are you calling
Mr. Myles?

07:37.040 --> 07:39.056
<i>I tried you at your lab.
You weren't answering.</i>

07:39.080 --> 07:40.080
<i>I left three messages.</i>

07:40.160 --> 07:41.514
<i>You never returned
any of them.</i>

07:41.600 --> 07:42.736
<i>What else was
I supposed to do?</i>

07:42.760 --> 07:44.319
Wait for me to call you back?

07:44.440 --> 07:45.669
<i>Why isn't your holo on?</i>

07:45.760 --> 07:48.036
Uh, it doesn't work
in the Flash Museum.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.496
<i>For the life of me,
I've never understood</i>

07:49.520 --> 07:50.795
<i>your obsession
with that place.</i>

07:50.880 --> 07:53.395
<i>What are you even doing there?
Are you there alone?</i>

07:53.480 --> 07:55.676
It's fine, Mom.
I'm researching a case.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.956
<i>- What kind of case?</i>
- One that I can't talk about.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.400
<i>I'm your mother, Nora.</i>

07:59.480 --> 08:01.756
And I'm an employee
of CCPD who can't talk

08:01.840 --> 08:02.990
about open cases.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.576
Mom, how many times do I have
to tell you this?

08:04.600 --> 08:06.478
You were married to a CSI.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.392
<i>Yes, I was.</i>

08:10.760 --> 08:13.514
I'm sorry.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.239
What were you calling about?

08:15.320 --> 08:18.438
<i>I thought my daughter might
want to know how I'm doing</i>

08:18.520 --> 08:20.910
<i>in Coast City.
I almost finished my story.</i>

08:21.000 --> 08:22.673
<i>I should be home
in a few days.</i>

08:22.760 --> 08:24.797
Great.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.519
Uh, Mom, I gotta go.
It's work.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.795
<i>- Love you.</i>
- Love you.

08:27.880 --> 08:29.075
Hey.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.536
<i>Hey, meet me
at Ollins Laboratory.</i>

08:30.560 --> 08:32.416
<i>I sent the list of stolen
chemicals to an old teacher</i>

08:32.440 --> 08:34.830
<i>of mine and I think
he found something.</i>

08:36.720 --> 08:38.518
Appreciate the help,
Dr. Bonwit,

08:38.600 --> 08:40.592
- especially at this hour.
- Not a problem.

08:40.679 --> 08:42.797
Ollins never lets me leave
this place anyway.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.736
So Lia was telling me you
might know how these chemicals

08:45.760 --> 08:47.797
- can be used together.
- Yes and no.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.838
Took me a bit to see it,
but the only way they seem

08:51.920 --> 08:54.560
to work together is if they're
built on a structure.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.552
Like an extracellular matrix.

08:56.680 --> 08:59.832
But there are thousands
of extracellular matrices.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.136
So until we know
all the chemicals,

09:01.160 --> 09:03.755
we won't know the end results.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.399
Sorry I can't help more.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.557
- That's okay.
- Thanks, Dr. Bonwit.

09:09.240 --> 09:10.754
Now what?

09:10.840 --> 09:13.514
We can't just wait
for another lab to get hit.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.758
Holy shrap!

09:20.200 --> 09:21.520
Dr. Bonwit!

09:23.520 --> 09:25.034
Oh, my God!

09:26.400 --> 09:29.234
Yes, I am a god.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.470
The god of speed.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.313
Go, go, go, go, go!

09:42.720 --> 09:43.915
Nora!

09:45.680 --> 09:47.797
Nora!

09:47.880 --> 09:51.032
Somebody help, please!

10:02.200 --> 10:04.112
<i>♪♪ No, he can't read
my poker face ♪♪</i>

10:04.200 --> 10:05.873
Oh, I knew an oldie
would wake you up.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.231
Okay, don't freak.
Uh, we're in a hospital.

10:08.320 --> 10:12.200
Me for this burn and you
for a whole lot more.

10:12.280 --> 10:13.999
- Dr. Bonwit?
- Uh, ICU.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.200
But he's gonna pull through.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.616
Um, but the speedster did get
away with, like, a crazy amount

10:17.640 --> 10:18.835
of Carbon Disulfide.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.718
Don't worry about
that right now.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.120
How are you feeling?

10:22.800 --> 10:26.396
I... I feel fine, actually.

10:26.520 --> 10:29.115
My fingers are a little tingly
but other than that,

10:29.200 --> 10:31.999
I... I feel really good.
It's weird, right?

10:32.080 --> 10:33.514
I'm just so glad you're okay.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.195
Your doctor said you got hit
with five billion joules

10:36.320 --> 10:40.917
of electricity.
Which means, um, I, uh...

10:41.000 --> 10:43.879
I, uh, kind of called your mom.
Um, and she, uh...

10:43.960 --> 10:47.078
She freaked more than normal.
Um, I had to.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.880
- You could have died.
- Lia, is she here?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.256
She's on her way
from Coast City.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.431
Uh, and she is wearing
her aggro pants.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.591
I mean, she has called me,
like, 47 times.

10:55.680 --> 10:56.800
You should have ignored her.

10:56.840 --> 10:57.896
I just... I don't want
her to worry.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.240
I did.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.596
Uh, which is why she
doesn't know about this.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.696
The paramedics said that
you went into cardiac arrest

11:03.720 --> 11:05.736
when you got here and so they
had to use the defib nodes

11:05.760 --> 11:07.752
to restart your heart,
and when they did,

11:07.840 --> 11:09.069
they found this.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.720
It was buried underneath the
scar under your right shoulder.

11:11.800 --> 11:13.598
What is it?

11:13.680 --> 11:15.433
They say it's a metal
scrap from the shelf

11:15.520 --> 11:17.352
you got thrown into,
but I don't know.

11:17.440 --> 11:21.036
It looks kind of old
and... and pretty fried.

11:21.120 --> 11:23.080
Okay, wait, but now that
we both know you're okay,

11:23.200 --> 11:25.954
can we please talk about
the fact that you got struck

11:26.080 --> 11:27.560
by lightning from a speedster?

11:27.640 --> 11:28.835
So schway, right?

11:28.920 --> 11:30.416
The only thing is no one's
gonna believe us.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.477
We both saw it.
They're gonna have to.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.998
<i>Stay calm.</i>

11:44.080 --> 11:46.879
<i>There has been an incident.
System check in progress.</i>

11:50.200 --> 11:52.078
What the hell?

11:53.200 --> 11:54.759
<i>Catch this.</i>

11:56.640 --> 11:59.075
I'm okay!

11:59.160 --> 12:01.470
You sure?

12:01.560 --> 12:05.236
Yeah, dude.
I'm a speedster.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.994
All of my nerves are tingling
and my synapses must be

12:08.120 --> 12:12.114
going crazy because my reaction
times are way off the charts.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.719
What am I gonna do
about my mom?

12:15.800 --> 12:19.350
She freaks out any time someone
even says the word meta.

12:19.440 --> 12:20.760
Okay, well,
that's understandable.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.110
I mean, her non-meta husband
died because of metas.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.318
Yeah, but writing about
the Flash... the meta-human...

12:26.400 --> 12:28.960
- made her career.
- So we can't tell her?

12:29.040 --> 12:31.191
No, we can't tell anybody.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.840
Not until we figure out
how I got these powers.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.310
And I don't think it's a
coincidence that this happened

12:36.440 --> 12:39.478
after my little run-in
with the god of speed guy.

12:39.560 --> 12:43.270
You mean when Godspeed
hit you with his lightning.

12:43.360 --> 12:44.800
Which, according
to the Flash Museum,

12:44.840 --> 12:46.399
is exactly what happened to...

12:46.480 --> 12:48.597
The Flash.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.038
<i>10-90 in progress.</i>

12:51.120 --> 12:53.430
Bank heist.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.079
Huh.

12:55.160 --> 12:56.560
No, no.
You can't do that.

12:56.640 --> 12:57.640
That is a bad idea.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.313
That is like cut
your own bangs bad.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.471
I'm just gonna do
a little run-by.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.438
You are a CSI,
not a superhero.

13:03.520 --> 13:05.796
Our jobs are the same
as the cops.

13:05.880 --> 13:08.156
We get the bad guys.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.677
All right.
Go get 'em, Flash Woman.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.274
Lady Flash.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.635
Hot Flash.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.520
Not that one.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.080
Okay, we're gonna workshop
that later.

13:19.120 --> 13:22.113
Until then,
I have to guard Central City.

13:26.880 --> 13:29.395
Ah!

13:29.480 --> 13:30.880
Stop or I'll fire!

13:32.440 --> 13:34.238
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

13:37.280 --> 13:40.830
Oh, um, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

13:43.080 --> 13:45.311
Freeze!

13:45.400 --> 13:47.153
Oh, uh...

13:52.240 --> 13:53.276
What in the world?

13:53.360 --> 13:55.511
Bug and Byte,
you're under arrest!

13:55.600 --> 13:57.512
Go, go, go!
Take them down!

14:00.400 --> 14:04.030
You fried your gauntlet
and half the fleet.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.032
It was only three cruisers.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.396
Now Captain Frye's gonna be
on his warpath

14:08.480 --> 14:10.256
which is gonna make
everybody's life miserable.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.999
I'm sorry, Nora.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.437
I know today didn't exactly
go so great.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.718
Both robbers got away
because of me.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.471
Cut yourself a slice
of slack pie.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.597
It was your first day.
No one got hurt.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.336
And plus they found Bug
and Byte hunched over

14:25.360 --> 14:27.272
with runner's cramps, like,
ten minutes later.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.670
But I still feel so bad.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.513
You're looking
at this all wrong.

14:31.640 --> 14:34.439
Today was not Nora's
big failure.

14:34.560 --> 14:38.190
Today was the Femme-Flash's
big debut.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.559
Naming superheroes is not easy.

14:43.840 --> 14:47.151
Lia, you are the best friend
a shrappy speedster

14:47.280 --> 14:48.873
could ever ask for.

14:49.800 --> 14:52.918
But I think we both know
that CCPD isn't equipped

14:53.000 --> 14:54.753
to stop this guy.

14:54.840 --> 14:57.036
The only way we're gonna
catch him before

14:57.120 --> 15:00.272
anyone else gets hurt
is if I start thinking

15:00.360 --> 15:02.352
like a villainous speedster.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.193
And how are you
gonna do that?

15:06.200 --> 15:08.192
I'm gonna go see one.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.194
<i>Reverse-Flash, huh?</i>

15:14.280 --> 15:17.717
Well, officer, you're, like,
the second person in 15 years

15:17.800 --> 15:20.315
who's come to visit
this psychopath.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.676
Not even a call.

15:22.760 --> 15:25.639
Are you sure you want
to interview him by yourself?

15:25.720 --> 15:27.951
I've been alone
with criminals before.

15:29.280 --> 15:30.430
Hmm.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.077
You have five minutes.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.673
Eobard Thawne?

16:06.800 --> 16:09.474
My name is Nora West-Allen,
and I'm a CSI tech

16:09.560 --> 16:10.960
with the CCPD.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.316
I wanted to ask you
a few questions, if I could.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.269
Come closer.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.234
Nora West-Allen.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.031
Don't be afraid.

16:30.120 --> 16:33.352
The dampening capabilities
of this cell can negate

16:33.440 --> 16:36.160
the powers of 1,000
meta-humans.

16:36.240 --> 16:39.631
The glass, the walls,
the ceiling, the floors

16:39.720 --> 16:42.440
are all connected to a power
energizer that will zap

16:42.560 --> 16:46.600
this place with
400 kilojoules instantly

16:46.680 --> 16:49.195
should the dampeners fail.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.511
Making the cell phase-proof.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.555
I couldn't hurt you,
Nora West-Allen.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.193
Even if I wanted to.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.833
What are your questions?

17:09.680 --> 17:11.353
How did you end up in here?

17:11.440 --> 17:13.590
Was there nobody at CCPD
that could answer

17:13.680 --> 17:15.239
that question for you?

17:15.319 --> 17:17.436
All the files pertaining
to the Reverse-Flash

17:17.520 --> 17:18.920
have been cyber locked.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.038
And there's almost nothing
about you in the Flash Museum,

17:22.119 --> 17:24.237
except for the date
of your imprisonment.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.311
Really?

17:26.440 --> 17:28.000
That's all there is
in the Flash Museum?

17:28.040 --> 17:29.474
That's interesting.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.756
Will you tell me how
you were defeated?

17:31.840 --> 17:33.160
Why do you want to know that?

17:33.280 --> 17:36.512
It'll help us with
an investigation.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.035
You need to work
on your lying.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.640
Nora.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.840
Your shoes are new.

17:44.920 --> 17:47.560
But your soles are worn.

17:47.640 --> 17:49.597
You have singe marks
on your sleeves

17:49.680 --> 17:51.353
and singe marks
on your pant legs,

17:51.440 --> 17:53.909
but most of all,
your cheeks are flushed

17:54.000 --> 17:55.514
with windburn.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.477
Oh, I know that windburn.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.552
I can still feel it.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.239
You're a speedster.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.076
Time's up.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.840
Please, I need your help.

18:20.920 --> 18:21.920
Come on. Let's go.

18:26.320 --> 18:28.391
Time to repent, Professor.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.276
Thawne figured out
I had powers,

18:52.400 --> 18:55.234
but he wouldn't tell me
anything about them.

18:56.960 --> 18:58.280
What?

18:59.840 --> 19:01.856
And don't tell me it's nothing,
'cause your whole face

19:01.880 --> 19:03.792
says it's something.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.917
You know this metal
fragment they found

19:06.000 --> 19:08.231
- underneath your shoulder?
- Yeah.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.118
Well, something about it
was bugging me,

19:10.200 --> 19:12.112
so I did some digging.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.590
It turns out it's not from that
shelf you got thrown into.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.478
It's, uh... It's tech.

19:16.560 --> 19:20.031
A chip made by S.T.A.R. Labs
25 years ago.

19:20.120 --> 19:23.033
Like a chip you would use
to find a lost animal?

19:24.760 --> 19:27.320
- It's to dampen your speed.
- What?

19:28.720 --> 19:30.600
You didn't get your powers
when Godspeed hit you

19:30.680 --> 19:32.876
with his lightning.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.838
It looks like you
always had them.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.958
I... I've always had powers?

19:42.360 --> 19:45.592
Why do... Who would put a power
dampening chip inside of...

19:50.040 --> 19:52.157
Your mom lied
to you your whole life.

19:52.240 --> 19:55.472
I mean, that's
next-level aggro.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.376
How could she keep something
like that from me?

19:57.400 --> 19:59.869
I mean, what else
has she lied to me about?

19:59.960 --> 20:01.713
I think you're gonna have
to ask her.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.269
Oh, just the idea of that
makes my blood boil.

20:04.360 --> 20:05.555
That could be the macchiato.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.717
It's possible I might have
made that a triple.

20:09.480 --> 20:12.120
At least I have one person
in my life I can still trust.

20:16.480 --> 20:19.040
- A triple.
- That's been established.

20:19.120 --> 20:22.113
No, no, no, not the coffee.
I mean, yes, the coffee.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.232
But the chemicals
that Godspeed stole.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.960
Benzene Methanol is unstable,
and if you add

20:27.040 --> 20:29.600
the Carbon Disulfide that
he stole from Ollins lab...

20:29.680 --> 20:30.680
Kablooey.

20:30.760 --> 20:32.416
I remember that from
9th grade Analytical Chem.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.576
And the only way to combine
all those chemicals together

20:34.600 --> 20:37.672
is if you add some kind
of binding property.

20:37.760 --> 20:39.520
Right, you'd need a plus-one
oxidation state,

20:39.560 --> 20:41.517
like a... a Dioxygen Diflouride.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.360
Yes, and somewhere that's
able to store that,

20:43.400 --> 20:46.074
and the only place
in Central City that can

20:46.160 --> 20:47.276
is Stagg Industries.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.111
I cannot believe my first
time at Stagg Industries

20:54.200 --> 20:55.839
is as a burglar.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.957
Or are we vigilantes?

20:59.640 --> 21:01.359
Lia, I found it.

21:03.480 --> 21:06.598
Unless your super speed
came with super biceps,

21:06.680 --> 21:08.194
we are not getting
this out of here.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.675
That's mine.

21:14.280 --> 21:16.272
Uh, okay.
Try and get this open.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.680
It'll evaporate in seconds.

21:17.760 --> 21:20.480
If you want it, you're gonna
have to come through me

21:20.560 --> 21:21.789
to get it.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.952
Ah, you're a speedster
like me.

21:25.040 --> 21:27.350
So you need it too.

21:27.440 --> 21:29.909
Sorry.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.717
No!

21:55.640 --> 21:58.633
Lia! Lia!

21:58.720 --> 22:01.155
Lia!

22:01.240 --> 22:03.277
Lia!

22:03.360 --> 22:05.875
The one person in the world
she thought she could trust

22:05.960 --> 22:07.553
died in her arms.

22:07.640 --> 22:09.677
Nora must have felt
completely alone.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.475
- But she wasn't.
- Yes, she was.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.273
Because I wasn't
honest with her.

22:15.360 --> 22:16.680
Iris...

22:16.760 --> 22:18.520
After all I did,
she gave me a second chance.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.680
It's the least
we can do for her.

22:33.240 --> 22:34.674
Mom?

22:38.760 --> 22:40.558
Don't make me regret this.

22:57.720 --> 22:59.393
What are you doing?

22:59.520 --> 23:01.416
I'm giving our daughter
the chance to explain this

23:01.440 --> 23:02.715
for herself.

23:25.920 --> 23:27.912
Nora.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.395
I heard about... Lia.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.994
Honey, I'm so sorry.

23:36.680 --> 23:39.070
I know how it is to lose
someone you love.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.456
If you don't wanna talk
about it right now,

23:44.480 --> 23:46.790
that's okay.

23:46.880 --> 23:49.839
Or maybe you just don't wanna
talk about it with me.

23:51.960 --> 23:56.671
Nora, can I just make sure
that you're okay?

23:56.760 --> 23:59.480
Nora, I went to the hospital
and they said that you left.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.279
Yeah.

24:01.360 --> 24:03.829
I guess lightning doesn't
hurt as much when you already

24:03.960 --> 24:05.872
have it coursing
through your veins.

24:09.880 --> 24:10.916
Does this look familiar?

24:13.040 --> 24:15.794
How about now?

24:17.000 --> 24:19.117
- Nora...
- Lia found it before she died.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.873
You put this inside of me, Mom.

24:24.120 --> 24:27.113
To dampen my powers?

24:27.200 --> 24:28.998
You lied to me my whole life.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.633
I know.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.632
Who else knows?

24:36.840 --> 24:38.513
Who else?

24:39.920 --> 24:41.320
Everyone.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.956
Everybody?

24:46.040 --> 24:49.636
Everyone that I love
has been keeping this from me?

24:49.720 --> 24:52.519
- Why?
- Because I told them to.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.600
Why would you do that?

24:53.720 --> 24:55.313
Nora, I was trying
to protect you.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.437
- From what?
- From this city.

24:57.520 --> 25:00.672
From... from meta-humans.
From... from...

25:00.760 --> 25:01.876
yourself.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.599
Wow.

25:03.680 --> 25:07.515
- Nora, you don't understand.
- No, I don't understand.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.034
How did I get my powers?

25:09.120 --> 25:10.336
What do you have
against speedsters?

25:10.360 --> 25:14.400
Nora, I have already
lost so much.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.358
I can't risk losing you too.

25:18.400 --> 25:21.359
Well, you just did.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.991
I'm gonna miss Lia too.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.632
West-Allen, we all know
how close you two were.

25:50.720 --> 25:53.110
If you need some time off,
I'm sure Captain Frye...

25:53.200 --> 25:55.317
We need to get the guy
who did this.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.790
Whatever it takes.

25:57.880 --> 25:59.480
We ran the evidence
from the crime scene.

25:59.560 --> 26:03.076
Turns out there was foreign DNA
in Lia's exit wound.

26:03.160 --> 26:06.631
But we've used it
to positively ID this guy.

26:06.720 --> 26:09.554
August Hart.
Bio-hacker.

26:09.640 --> 26:13.156
Mercury Labs intern,
and then grad school.

26:19.480 --> 26:22.040
All yours.

26:22.120 --> 26:24.840
Says he was kicked out
for testing tachyon stimulants

26:24.920 --> 26:28.118
on coma patients.
What the hell's a tachyon?

26:28.200 --> 26:30.237
A particle that moves
faster than light.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.039
Well, an arrest warrant's
on its way now.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.555
I promise you this guy's gonna
get what he deserves.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.114
Yes, he will.

26:42.680 --> 26:44.239
<i>Did you know
not all villains</i>

26:44.320 --> 26:46.277
<i>had meta-human powers?
Some u-</i>

26:48.880 --> 26:53.193
<i>Make sure you get this.
Everybody move!</i>

26:55.960 --> 26:57.235
Godspeed's lightning...

27:00.160 --> 27:03.517
It turned blue,
just like Zoom's.

27:03.640 --> 27:05.279
Hey, wait a sec.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.792
<i>Although her body
disintegrated,</i>

27:13.880 --> 27:15.951
<i>authorities uncovered evidence
at Mercury Labs</i>

27:16.040 --> 27:17.713
<i>of the illegal
speed-enhancement drug,</i>

27:17.800 --> 27:19.598
<i>Velocity-9.</i>

27:19.680 --> 27:22.559
<i>This volatile stimulant
gave Trajectory incredible speed,</i>

27:22.640 --> 27:25.155
<i>but at a deadly price.</i>

27:25.240 --> 27:26.356
That's it.

27:26.440 --> 27:29.433
Benzene Methanol,
Carbon Disulfide,

27:29.520 --> 27:31.273
Dioxygen Diflouride.

27:31.360 --> 27:34.512
The base for the extracellular
matrix for Velocity-9.

27:34.600 --> 27:38.640
Only he's trying to make one
that will last forever.

27:51.360 --> 27:54.114
How do I stop a speedster?

27:54.200 --> 27:56.431
- You can't.
- Not alone.

27:56.520 --> 27:58.955
But with you, I can.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.839
No.

28:02.920 --> 28:05.276
That plinth,
it takes incoming calls,

28:05.360 --> 28:07.352
and from what I hear,
you have a few left.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.432
You could walk me through
it via comms.

28:09.520 --> 28:10.590
No.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.717
He has stolen enough
chemicals to make

28:12.800 --> 28:15.679
an extracellular matrix
that replicates speed powers.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.240
I told you to leave.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.096
The only thing that
is stopping him from becoming

28:19.120 --> 28:21.589
a speedster permanently
is a stabilizing agent.

28:21.720 --> 28:24.554
Once he gets that,
he will be unstoppable.

28:24.680 --> 28:26.558
I told you to leave!
Guard!

28:26.680 --> 28:28.194
Please.

28:28.280 --> 28:31.273
He killed my best friend
in front of me.

28:33.720 --> 28:36.713
She's gone because of him,
and you are the only person

28:36.800 --> 28:38.757
that can stop it.

28:44.800 --> 28:49.955
What the hell?
You need to leave now.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.514
Nora.

29:10.560 --> 29:13.314
Okay, I'm at the
innovation lab at CCU.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.232
- Are you there?
- Yes, I'm here.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.676
Okay, are you sure this
is gonna short out

29:17.760 --> 29:19.353
- the scanner circuits?
- Yes, I'm sure.

29:19.440 --> 29:22.035
Vibrate your hands together.
Build an electric shock.

29:22.120 --> 29:23.190
Okay.

29:26.400 --> 29:27.754
Schway.

29:27.840 --> 29:29.240
It worked.

29:30.040 --> 29:33.636
<i>Now look for the brightest
room.</i>

29:35.160 --> 29:37.629
<i>The converter needs constant
fluorescent light.</i>

29:40.280 --> 29:41.999
Now locate
the biometric converter.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.833
<i>It will be a kidney-shaped
object</i>

29:43.920 --> 29:44.920
I think I found it.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.954
No way for Godspeed to
stabilize his Velocity-9 now.

29:55.600 --> 29:58.274
You don't learn, do you?

29:58.360 --> 29:59.840
That's mine.

29:59.920 --> 30:01.593
Come and get it.

30:07.920 --> 30:09.673
It worked!

30:14.760 --> 30:17.639
No.
He's got more V-9.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.496
Nora, you need to get out
of there now.

30:25.520 --> 30:27.193
<i>Right now!</i>

30:35.200 --> 30:37.351
I can't lose him!

30:37.480 --> 30:38.550
Thawne!

30:38.640 --> 30:40.916
<i>Did you hear me?
I said I can't lose him!</i>

30:41.000 --> 30:43.913
All right, Nora,
do you see any walls

30:44.000 --> 30:45.753
<i>near where you are,
preferably concrete?</i>

30:45.840 --> 30:47.069
Why?

30:47.160 --> 30:49.038
Because I want you
to run into one.

30:49.120 --> 30:51.351
Or rather, through one.

30:51.440 --> 30:52.656
I can't run through
a concrete wall!

30:52.680 --> 30:54.114
Yes, you can.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.112
If you vibrate at the natural
frequency of air,

30:56.200 --> 30:59.034
your body, your cells,
will be in such a state that they

30:59.120 --> 31:00.634
will phase right
through that wall.

31:00.720 --> 31:02.916
I can't do this!

31:03.000 --> 31:05.640
Nora, listen to me.

31:05.720 --> 31:08.235
<i>Listen to my voice.</i>

31:08.320 --> 31:10.994
Breathe.

31:11.080 --> 31:14.039
<i>Breathe.</i>

31:14.120 --> 31:17.830
Feel the wind on your face.

31:17.920 --> 31:20.355
The ground beneath your feet.

31:20.480 --> 31:23.120
And the lightning.

31:23.200 --> 31:26.637
<i>Its electricity surging
through your veins.</i>

31:26.720 --> 31:29.872
To your nerve endings
from the crown of your head

31:29.960 --> 31:33.590
to the tips of your toes
like an electric shock

31:33.680 --> 31:35.399
you never want to end.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.314
<i>You're part of something
greater now, Nora.</i>

31:38.400 --> 31:42.952
You are part of the
Speed Force and its power,

31:43.040 --> 31:45.999
its power is yours to use.
Now do it.

31:55.520 --> 31:56.795
I can't.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.030
<i>I can't do it.</i>

32:02.800 --> 32:04.154
Then good-bye, Little Runner.

32:04.240 --> 32:08.439
No, no.
Uh, I'm sorry.

32:08.520 --> 32:11.877
I trust you.
Uh, what now?

32:12.680 --> 32:15.673
Nora, you can't run forever.

32:15.760 --> 32:18.116
<i>You're gonna have to stop him.</i>

32:18.200 --> 32:19.839
Tell me what you
see around you.

32:19.920 --> 32:23.118
Um, uh, I'm on 5th and Park.

32:23.200 --> 32:26.238
I see Choi Enterprises,
Peercoin Bank,

32:26.320 --> 32:28.073
and CC Citizen Media.

32:28.160 --> 32:29.514
Media, the satellites.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.876
Nora, we're gonna use
the satellites' electromagnetic

32:31.960 --> 32:33.792
radiation to break
the V-9 bonds.

32:33.880 --> 32:35.792
Flood Godspeed
with anti-endorphins.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.712
Neutralizing
the V-9 instantly.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.029
Exactly,
but here's the thing.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.918
Those satellites recalibrate
on the hour,

32:41.000 --> 32:43.151
emitting very short bursts
of microwave energy.

32:43.240 --> 32:45.516
You're only gonna have a few
seconds to get Godspeed

32:45.600 --> 32:47.398
in front of those bursts.
Do you understand?

32:47.480 --> 32:49.711
So I just need him to follow
me into the building.

32:49.800 --> 32:53.350
Not into the building.
Up the building.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.875
Uh, okay.
I can do that.

32:55.960 --> 32:59.112
Um, how fast do I have to go
to run up a building?

32:59.200 --> 33:01.510
As fast as you can.

33:04.520 --> 33:05.520
Here he comes.

33:06.160 --> 33:07.879
Then run, Nora.

33:08.760 --> 33:09.830
Run.

33:23.080 --> 33:26.471
Wait for it, Nora.
Wait.

33:30.720 --> 33:32.120
<i>And now!</i>

33:45.400 --> 33:48.074
Nora.
Nora!

33:48.160 --> 33:49.355
We did it!

33:50.400 --> 33:51.914
<i>We did it.</i>

33:52.000 --> 33:53.878
Yes, we did.

34:00.240 --> 34:02.960
<i>Well, we don't have to worry
about Godspeed anymore.</i>

34:03.480 --> 34:06.473
August Hart is in
the custody of CCPD.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.275
Bravo, Little Runner.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.039
I still have a lot to learn,
you know.

34:14.159 --> 34:16.436
- You could train me.
- I can't train you, Nora.

34:18.719 --> 34:20.518
There's just not enough time.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.152
What... what are
you talking about?

34:23.239 --> 34:25.391
- You're...
- Nora.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.551
My time on this earth
is coming to an end.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.993
There's so much
I wanted to ask you.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.639
So much that
I still don't know.

34:46.719 --> 34:48.951
So much that my mom
has lied to me about.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.915
You have no idea.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.320
What do you know?

34:57.520 --> 34:59.432
Thawne, please, you may be
the only person left

34:59.520 --> 35:01.159
in my life who won't lie to me.

35:04.760 --> 35:07.070
Nora,

35:07.680 --> 35:10.320
how much do you really know
about the Flash?

35:33.400 --> 35:37.474
Five, six, seven.

35:54.200 --> 35:56.556
Holy shrap.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.593
<i>Good evening,
Nora West-Allen.</i>

36:40.680 --> 36:43.832
Um, hi.

36:43.920 --> 36:45.752
Uh...

36:45.840 --> 36:47.069
You know who I am?

36:47.160 --> 36:49.391
<i>Of course.
Nora West-Allen.</i>

36:49.480 --> 36:51.790
<i>Daughter of Iris West
and Barry Allen,</i>

36:51.880 --> 36:54.076
<i>also known as the Flash.</i>

36:56.400 --> 36:57.800
Wh...

36:57.880 --> 36:59.917
S... Did you...

37:00.000 --> 37:04.199
Did you just say my father,
Barry Allen,

37:04.280 --> 37:05.999
was the Flash?

37:06.080 --> 37:07.992
<i>Would you like me to play
your video message,</i>

37:08.120 --> 37:09.270
<i>Nora West-Allen?</i>

37:11.120 --> 37:13.191
My... My message?

37:13.280 --> 37:15.920
<i>Yes, from your father,
Barry Allen.</i>

37:16.000 --> 37:19.232
Uh, y... yes.

37:19.320 --> 37:22.597
<i>Nora,</i>

37:22.680 --> 37:24.080
<i>I don't have much time.</i>

37:26.840 --> 37:29.594
<i>If you're watching this,
it means you're like me.</i>

37:31.440 --> 37:32.920
<i>You have powers.</i>

37:35.600 --> 37:37.296
<i>It also means I wasn't there
to help you learn</i>

37:37.320 --> 37:39.880
<i>how to use them.</i>

37:39.960 --> 37:43.397
<i>I wasn't there
for a lot of things.</i>

37:43.480 --> 37:46.996
<i>Remember, my sweet Nora,</i>

37:47.080 --> 37:52.075
<i>always remember,
I love you.</i>

37:52.160 --> 37:53.719
<i>I always will.</i>

38:08.800 --> 38:11.110
I just wanted to see you, Dad.

38:17.920 --> 38:20.037
Thawne...

38:20.120 --> 38:21.713
showed me how.

38:22.480 --> 38:23.709
And Cicada?

38:23.800 --> 38:26.520
The one case
we both couldn't solve.

38:28.200 --> 38:31.591
It was my idea
to come here and make it right.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.312
Okay.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.637
Can I have a minute alone
with Nora?

38:41.400 --> 38:42.880
Of course.

38:56.200 --> 38:58.795
How many times
did you go back to Thawne?

38:58.880 --> 39:00.200
How many times?

39:00.280 --> 39:01.794
After the night
of the Enlightenment.

39:02.560 --> 39:05.598
Five, uh, maybe six.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.836
Even knowing
he killed my mother?

39:10.920 --> 39:14.391
- Dad...
- I understand...

39:14.480 --> 39:17.837
coming back to meet me...

39:17.920 --> 39:19.240
and the team.

39:19.320 --> 39:21.118
I do.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.669
I even understand
going to Thawne...

39:24.960 --> 39:27.429
to learn how to do it, but...

39:27.520 --> 39:30.354
you kept going back.

39:30.440 --> 39:31.920
Even after you knew
what he did.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.596
Even after he wasn't
your only option anymore.

39:37.360 --> 39:40.671
And the worst part is,
you lied to us every time.

39:40.760 --> 39:42.194
D-Dad, I...

39:42.280 --> 39:44.351
I don't trust you, Nora.

39:46.240 --> 39:49.472
I can't have
anybody here with us

39:49.560 --> 39:52.553
that I don't trust anymore.

39:54.320 --> 39:55.993
W-what are you saying?

39:56.120 --> 39:58.954
It's time for you to go home.

40:01.720 --> 40:04.599
Dad, please don't do this!

40:04.680 --> 40:08.310
I promise I will never
see Thawne again!

40:08.400 --> 40:10.357
Dad, don't do this!

40:10.440 --> 40:13.239
Nora, if you try
to run back in time again,

40:13.320 --> 40:15.915
I will feel it
in the Speed Force.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.593
I'll know.

40:19.520 --> 40:21.239
Good-bye, Nora.

40:44.920 --> 40:47.037
So she finally came clean.

40:49.880 --> 40:53.954
Or did you figure it out
all by yourself?

40:54.040 --> 40:55.679
One wasn't enough?

40:58.640 --> 41:01.200
You had to try to take
my daughter from me too?

41:03.080 --> 41:04.309
My daughter!

41:04.440 --> 41:07.080
I knew you'd react like this.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.514
You're always so emotional,

41:08.600 --> 41:12.150
which is why I had her
keep all of this from you.

41:12.280 --> 41:14.749
You can't blame
the Little Runner, Barry.

41:14.840 --> 41:17.514
She just wanted to spend
some time with her dad.

41:19.800 --> 41:21.678
Don't hold that against her.

41:24.120 --> 41:26.840
Consider it a condemned man's
last request.

41:29.840 --> 41:30.956
You always thought you were

41:31.040 --> 41:33.077
so much smarter
than us, Thawne.

41:35.440 --> 41:37.193
But you lost.

41:41.160 --> 41:44.278
And now you're finally gonna
get what you deserve.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.560
<i>Greg, move your head!</i>
