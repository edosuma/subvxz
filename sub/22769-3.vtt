Mm, lemme touch it.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.380
(sniffing)

11:08.620 --> 11:12.790
Mmm... that my friend,
is clearly monster goo!

11:12.790 --> 11:15.580
♪ Who's the cool guy
who's always right? ♪

11:15.580 --> 11:18.500
♪ Who's real awesome
and out of sight? ♪

11:18.500 --> 11:21.500
♪ Who's biggest fear
is a spider bite? ♪

11:28.290 --> 11:30.250
(Go Go yawns)

11:31.670 --> 11:32.670
Baymax:
Hello.

11:34.290 --> 11:36.040
Oh, come on.
Where is it?
Where is it?

11:36.040 --> 11:38.420
-It clearly isn't here.
-But it has to be!

11:38.420 --> 11:40.040
The box is
labeled "purses."

11:40.040 --> 11:43.040
If the purse isn't
in the "purse" box,
nothing in my world makes sense!

11:43.040 --> 11:44.580
Don't worry.
I'm sure it'll turn up.

11:44.580 --> 11:47.420
Well, unless--
for the millionth time--
someone stole it.

11:47.420 --> 11:50.000
You know, your negativity
isn't helping.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.670
Okay, I'll be positive.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.330
-Positive you're not
getting your purse back.
-(gasp)

11:53.330 --> 11:54.880
Baymax:
Conflict resolution

11:54.880 --> 11:57.120
through a third party
is often effective.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.170
It's third-party time.

11:59.170 --> 12:01.290
And who has a box full
of butterflies?

12:01.290 --> 12:03.120
They were caterpillars
when I packed them.

12:03.120 --> 12:06.170
-Respect and un--
-Exactly, Baymax.
It's hard to respect somebody

12:06.170 --> 12:11.000
who's always, like,
"I'm so happy about everybody
and everything" all the time!

12:11.000 --> 12:14.920
-And understanding are--
-Well, I don't understand
why you're all

12:14.920 --> 12:19.670
-"I'm so serious and cool,
and... I have bubble gum."
-(pops)

12:19.670 --> 12:21.460
-Perhaps--
-I should find
somewhere else to live.

12:21.460 --> 12:23.290
Fine.
If that's what you want.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.880
That was not effective.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.580
(people screaming)

12:30.580 --> 12:32.000
Woman:
Disgusting!

12:32.000 --> 12:34.080
-(cars crash, honking)
-I think we found
Fred's monster.

12:34.080 --> 12:37.540
(funky '70s music playing)

12:37.540 --> 12:41.120
-What is that thing?
-He's hideous!

12:41.120 --> 12:43.040
Yeah, like you all
look amazing!

12:45.040 --> 12:46.290
Wha-- ohh!

12:46.290 --> 12:49.210
(bubbling sound)

12:49.210 --> 12:52.080
(grunting)

12:52.080 --> 12:54.000
Ooh? Ooh!

13:01.790 --> 13:03.120
What?

13:03.120 --> 13:04.880
Baymax, can you scan it?

13:04.880 --> 13:08.380
It? I'm still
a person in here!
I think.

13:09.380 --> 13:11.710
-(beeping)
-(grunting)

13:11.710 --> 13:12.920
Baymax:
Scan complete.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.620
-The monster...
-Hey!

13:14.620 --> 13:17.040
...consists of a mix
of human DNA

13:17.040 --> 13:20.040
and an unknown
chemical compound,
which is controlled

13:20.040 --> 13:21.960
by an electronic device.

13:21.960 --> 13:25.290
It also contains fragments
of Honey Lemon's purse.

13:25.290 --> 13:28.040
Oh, no, did my purse
do this to you?

13:28.040 --> 13:29.290
Purse?

13:29.290 --> 13:30.290
Purse! Ha!

13:30.290 --> 13:32.250
Yeah, I don't know anything
about a purse.

13:32.250 --> 13:34.250
You stole her purse,
didn't you?

13:34.250 --> 13:37.380
Oh, I see how it is.
Something goes missing,
and the first thing you do

13:37.380 --> 13:39.250
is blame the monster!

13:39.250 --> 13:41.330
Oh, yeah. He stole it.
You should've listened to me.

13:41.330 --> 13:43.500
Oh! Thank goodness!
(laughs)

13:43.500 --> 13:45.170
It wasn't a labeling error!

13:46.830 --> 13:49.620
I know this is terrible
for you, but for a few minutes,

13:49.620 --> 13:51.330
I didn't know
who I was anymore.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.080
You guys seem like
you have some issues
to work out,

13:54.080 --> 13:56.420
-so I'll just--
-You're not going
anywhere, thief.

13:56.420 --> 13:57.580
Yes, I am!

13:57.580 --> 13:58.670
-(splat)
-Oof!

13:58.670 --> 14:01.000
-(grunts)
-Ooh!

14:01.000 --> 14:02.290
Huh?

14:02.290 --> 14:04.170
Aah!
Get it off!
Get it off!

14:06.290 --> 14:08.960
-Fred: Haah!
-That-- that is a monster.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.330
I stand corrected.

14:10.330 --> 14:11.380
Fred:
Yes, you do!

14:11.380 --> 14:14.210
Everyone look at that
disgusting globby monster!

14:14.210 --> 14:15.500
He is globby,
isn't he?

14:15.500 --> 14:16.790
Fred:
Well, then it's settled.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.290
Mind if
we call you "Globby"?

14:18.290 --> 14:20.290
Of course I mind!

14:20.290 --> 14:22.120
Ugh, could this day
get any worse?

14:22.120 --> 14:24.250
(screams)

14:24.250 --> 14:27.170
Fred:
You gotta watch where
you're standing, Globby!

14:28.330 --> 14:29.500
What a mess.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.120
And it's all
my purse's fault!

14:31.120 --> 14:34.330
No. I-- I should take
responsibility.

14:34.330 --> 14:35.500
I should've listened
to Go Go.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.040
She was totally right.
I was totally wrong.

14:38.040 --> 14:41.580
Uhh-- I'm sorry. I'm--
everyone, I'm really,
really sorry.

14:41.580 --> 14:44.120
Really, really, really,
really sorry.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.960
Okay. Enough.
Too much apologizing.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.750
You're right.
Sorry. Sorry.

14:48.750 --> 14:50.790
It's-- uh-- mm.

14:50.790 --> 14:51.880
Sorry.

14:53.250 --> 14:54.920
(scrubbing)

14:54.920 --> 14:57.290
Guys?
Bad news.

14:57.290 --> 15:00.250
I'm pretty sure
this is not coming out!

15:00.250 --> 15:02.080
How do you feel
about the monster's name?

15:02.080 --> 15:03.880
"Globby's" short.
It's accurate.

15:03.880 --> 15:05.170
I feel it's apt.

15:05.170 --> 15:06.880
Cool!
I named the monster!

15:06.880 --> 15:09.540
This will be
my legacy to the world.

15:09.540 --> 15:12.170
Your new chem-purse
is almost ready, Honey Lemon.

15:12.170 --> 15:16.000
-(sighs)
-Hey, that's good news, right?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.420
Now you can come up
with something to stop Globby.

15:18.420 --> 15:20.040
I'll give it a shot...
I guess.

15:21.580 --> 15:23.880
Cheering people
up isn't really
my thing,

15:23.880 --> 15:26.830
but...
be happy!

15:26.830 --> 15:29.040
Because even though
you feel terrible,

15:29.040 --> 15:32.040
everything's actually great!

15:32.040 --> 15:34.500
(sighs)
You're right.
It's really not your thing.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.750
Baymax:
Honey Lemon.

15:35.750 --> 15:38.380
-(grunts)
-It is okay
to be sad sometimes.

15:38.380 --> 15:41.460
-There, there.
-(speaks gloomily)
Crying is pointless.

15:41.460 --> 15:44.290
It's time to face
the darkness of reality.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.920
I'll need to create a compound
to break down Globby's
viscoelastic properties.

15:49.920 --> 15:53.670
Hypothetically-- science term--
if someone in this room
didn't know the meaning

15:53.670 --> 15:56.290
of visco-- viscosi--
viscodiddy--

15:56.290 --> 15:57.750
(sighs)
I'm gonna make
an "unsticky" ball.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.210
I named the monster.

15:59.210 --> 16:01.330
Ugh! Not enough tripropylene.
My beaker's half-empty.

16:01.330 --> 16:05.080
It's half-full!
Uch. Can't believe
I just said that.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.790
(people screaming)

16:07.790 --> 16:12.290
And then I made
a totally pre-planned escape
by getting hit by a bus.

16:12.290 --> 16:13.420
Yeah, that's smooth.

16:13.420 --> 16:15.540
So, things are goin'
pretty great.

16:15.540 --> 16:20.330
Ah, but the one little hiccup is
I can't really control
my mutated body.

16:20.330 --> 16:21.580
Here, watch me try
to grab that spoon.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.710
-(glass shatters)
-(car horn honking)

16:23.710 --> 16:26.380
-(cat shrieks)
-Nice kitty! Nice kitty!

16:26.380 --> 16:29.420
You're even worse
at being a monster
than you were a thief.

16:29.420 --> 16:30.620
-(grunts)
-(beeping)

16:30.620 --> 16:32.500
What's that thing
with the blinkin' lights

16:32.500 --> 16:33.460
where your forehead
should be?

16:33.460 --> 16:36.080
Oh, that?
It's a billion-dollar invention

16:36.080 --> 16:37.710
that's supposed
to control stuff.

16:37.710 --> 16:40.830
Could it control your amorphous
and yet still repulsive body?

16:40.830 --> 16:43.290
Maybe, but I don't know
how it works.

16:45.420 --> 16:47.380
But he does.

16:47.380 --> 16:49.790
Cool.
You wanna split a scone?

16:49.790 --> 16:52.040
-(clinking)
-Krei: Could you speed
this along?

16:52.040 --> 16:53.620
I'm out of things
to think about.

16:55.330 --> 16:56.750
-(smash)
-(sculptor yelps)

16:59.670 --> 17:01.580
Krei:
Aah-- aah!

17:03.420 --> 17:06.460
Honey Lemon, how is that
unsticky ball coming along?

17:06.460 --> 17:08.620
Ugh, who knows?
The good news is

17:08.620 --> 17:11.080
I haven't ruined
another person's life
in the last half hour.

17:11.080 --> 17:13.420
That's pretty gloomy
for good news, Honey Lemon.

17:13.420 --> 17:16.750
Baymax, is there anything
in your data banks
that can help here?

17:16.750 --> 17:18.920
Baymax:
Research shows
that a pleasant image

17:18.920 --> 17:20.540
can improve
a negative mood.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.540
I will search
for a pleasant image.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.250
I think
you've already found it.

17:24.250 --> 17:25.500
I'd say that's a sign.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.880
More like a coincidence.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.170
Hello.
I am Baymax.

17:29.170 --> 17:31.670
But, you love adorable nonsense.

17:31.670 --> 17:33.960
I'm not into nonsense anymore.

17:33.960 --> 17:37.460
Uh, guys?
I think we should watch this.

17:37.460 --> 17:40.500
Our CEO, Alistair Krei,
was taken from his office

17:40.500 --> 17:45.500
through that window
by the monster we've all agreed
to call "Globby."

17:45.500 --> 17:48.120
Is there anything
you'd like to say
to your boss,

17:48.120 --> 17:49.170
if he's watching?

17:49.170 --> 17:50.460
Mr. Krei,
if you're watching,

17:50.460 --> 17:52.330
we're keeping you
in our thoughts,

17:52.330 --> 17:54.290
and also
I'm going home early.

17:54.290 --> 17:55.580
You approved it last week.

17:59.420 --> 18:01.960
This is unacceptable.
I'm rich!

18:01.960 --> 18:03.580
I'm connected!

18:03.580 --> 18:05.500
This is high.
This is very high!

18:05.500 --> 18:07.000
Are you crazy?

18:07.000 --> 18:10.500
Just tell me
how your fancy headband thing
works and I'll let you go.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.420
Aagh!

18:12.920 --> 18:15.460
Hey!
That's my neurotransmitter!
It's worth billions!

18:15.460 --> 18:16.580
Give it back!

18:16.580 --> 18:18.540
Hey!
Get outta my head!

18:18.540 --> 18:20.540
This is Bluff Dunder,

18:20.540 --> 18:22.330
bringing you
Monster Watch,

18:22.330 --> 18:23.790
live in the sky!

18:25.080 --> 18:27.620
Ooh! Aah!

18:27.620 --> 18:31.120
I might drop you
if I can't control my body
with your invention!

18:31.120 --> 18:33.960
There's nothing to learn,
just think--

18:33.960 --> 18:36.170
can you think?
--and it will naturally work!

18:36.170 --> 18:37.790
Yeah, but nothing
comes naturally to me.

18:37.790 --> 18:40.420
Ha-ha!
Big Hero 6!

18:40.420 --> 18:42.210
Ah, you could've
gotten here sooner,

18:42.210 --> 18:43.500
but, uh,
you can work on that.

18:43.500 --> 18:46.330
You might wanna
save the critique
until after we rescue you.

18:46.330 --> 18:50.420
Your disgusting
reign of terror
stops now, Globby!

18:50.420 --> 18:52.120
Aahhhhh!

18:52.120 --> 18:53.210
(grunting)

18:53.210 --> 18:56.670
-Baymax!
-My visual sensors
are impaired.

18:56.670 --> 19:00.000
Nobody does that
to Baymax and gets away
with it!

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Aaaah!

19:02.420 --> 19:04.000
Waah! Aaah!

19:04.000 --> 19:05.500
(whimpers)

19:05.500 --> 19:07.040
So high.

19:08.290 --> 19:09.330
Aah!

19:10.540 --> 19:12.580
Big Hero 6 has joined
Globby on the roof.

19:12.580 --> 19:15.460
You can count on Bluff Dunder
for second-by-second updates

19:15.460 --> 19:16.710
on this developing situation.

19:16.710 --> 19:19.290
Globby, this'll make you
not sticky.

19:19.290 --> 19:22.330
Stay back!
You're upsetting the monster!

19:22.330 --> 19:24.540
-Let Krei go!
-Wording, people!

19:24.540 --> 19:26.460
Everyone just be quiet!

19:26.460 --> 19:30.670
Can we just do this?
Some of us don't wanna
splatter all over the ground!

19:30.670 --> 19:33.540
Oh, I've been makin'
a lot of bad decisions lately!

19:33.540 --> 19:36.500
Baymax:
He is in need
of positive reinforcement.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.500
-Fred: Oh!
-Don't look at me.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.380
But super positivity
is your thing.

19:42.210 --> 19:44.460
The superheroes
appear to be working out
some personal issues.

19:44.460 --> 19:46.670
We don't need
another glass-half-empty girl.

19:46.670 --> 19:47.750
I've got that covered.

19:47.750 --> 19:50.830
-Yeah.
-Your ridiculously
upbeat attitude

19:50.830 --> 19:53.500
takes some getting used to,
but it's good for me.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.960
Thanks, Go Go.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.420
You're the best.

19:56.420 --> 19:58.880
Now make that freak of nature
feel good about himself.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.880
Baymax:
That sounded like
an excellent pep talk.

20:00.880 --> 20:05.290
Listen, Globby, I know things
look bad now, but there's
always a silver lining.

20:05.290 --> 20:06.580
You can make this work!

20:06.580 --> 20:09.670
The hero says there's
a silver lining
for the monster.

20:09.670 --> 20:12.120
Seems like a stretch...
to this reporter.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.500
Oh, come on.
Nobody believes in me!

20:14.500 --> 20:16.500
Why would you?
You don't even know me!

20:16.500 --> 20:18.790
Before, you were just
a common purse thief.

20:18.790 --> 20:22.420
Now, if you dedicate yourself
to making the best out
of the situation,

20:22.420 --> 20:24.790
-you can truly be special.
-Hmm?

20:24.790 --> 20:27.420
Nobody else
has your... abilities.

20:27.420 --> 20:29.500
-Ya think?
-I know.

20:29.500 --> 20:32.670
You're right.
This is a new beginning
for me.

20:32.670 --> 20:35.750
It's very touching,
but I want my prototype back.

20:35.750 --> 20:37.620
Get in there!
We need a better shot!

20:37.620 --> 20:39.290
Ah-haah!

20:39.290 --> 20:40.750
(screams)

20:40.750 --> 20:44.080
(emphatically)
I am special!

20:44.080 --> 20:45.080
Gotcha!

20:48.750 --> 20:50.420
This is
a little awkward.

20:50.420 --> 20:52.620
Thanks... I guess.

20:52.620 --> 20:55.580
Thank her.
She believed in me.

20:55.580 --> 21:00.170
My days of being a loser,
small-time purse snatcher
are behind me.

21:00.170 --> 21:02.620
That's right!
You're better than that!

21:02.620 --> 21:06.960
I am!
And that's why I'm gonna be
a super villain!

21:06.960 --> 21:08.830
No!
That's really not--

21:08.830 --> 21:12.880
The world will come
to fear the name "Globby"!

21:12.880 --> 21:15.710
(evil laugh)

21:15.710 --> 21:17.120
Hey, he stole my wallet!

21:17.120 --> 21:19.580
Fred: He just robbed
the richest man
in San Fransokyo?

21:19.580 --> 21:22.250
I think
he's gonna make
this super-villain thing work.

21:22.250 --> 21:24.460
(evil laugh)

21:29.670 --> 21:31.120
(thuds)

21:33.210 --> 21:35.500
Ow. Darn it!

21:37.710 --> 21:39.710
(theme music playing)
