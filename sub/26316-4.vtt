WEBVTT

00:11.221 --> 00:12.055
OK.

00:13.098 --> 00:15.225
That was an insane thing for us to do.

00:15.517 --> 00:17.685
Oh! OK, good news.

00:18.436 --> 00:21.356
I have the Doorman's key,
so no one will be able to come after us.

00:21.564 --> 00:24.317
Let's just try t--

00:26.736 --> 00:28.113
Your key is ringing.

00:29.489 --> 00:30.698
I have a question for you.

00:30.782 --> 00:32.450
Are you out of your damn mind?

00:32.575 --> 00:34.702
Your Honour,
look at it from my point of view.

00:34.744 --> 00:37.664
I have never been this angry in my life

00:37.789 --> 00:39.916
which is the age of the universe!

00:40.041 --> 00:45.171
I understand, but saving the souls of these
four humans is more important, so...

00:45.880 --> 00:47.549
we're not coming back until we do.

00:47.632 --> 00:51.052
Oh, don't you even try coming back here
cos when you walk through that door

00:51.094 --> 00:52.929
I am gonna be waiting for you.

00:52.971 --> 00:55.056
Sorry, Judge, I think you're breaking up.

00:55.140 --> 00:57.725
That's impossible.
It's a magical key, you dick.

00:58.226 --> 01:00.478
What are you doing? I can see you!

01:00.562 --> 01:02.772
This is perfect.

01:02.856 --> 01:05.275
We're right near Chidi's office,
and as far as I can tell

01:05.316 --> 01:06.818
the whole floor is abandoned.

01:06.901 --> 01:08.903
What do they use it for? Storage?

01:08.945 --> 01:10.947
- No, this is the journalism department.
- Huh.

01:10.989 --> 01:13.533
Bad for the world, good for us.

01:13.575 --> 01:17.162
So, somehow, with none of our powers

01:17.328 --> 01:21.457
we have to keep the group intact
and monitor their ethical progress.

01:23.418 --> 01:26.045
- So, how do we do that?
- Not sure.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.464
There's no way to track people's actual
point totals

01:28.506 --> 01:30.550
only the Accountants
have that information, but...

01:30.633 --> 01:34.554
I did install cameras and microphones,
so at least we can keep our eye on them.

01:35.471 --> 01:37.432
- Let's get peepin'!
- Ho!

01:38.600 --> 01:40.476
Oh, no. Not a great start.

01:40.602 --> 01:43.062
Eleanor farted
and then she blamed it on her chair.

01:43.646 --> 01:45.523
That's gonna cost her
at least a few points.

01:45.607 --> 01:47.525
There's a bolt missing or something...

01:47.609 --> 01:51.029
Before we begin,
Trevor is dropping out of the study.

01:51.070 --> 01:53.281
He sent me an email last night.

01:53.323 --> 01:57.577
"I'm sad to inform you that I am too ugly
and stupid to be in the study

01:57.619 --> 01:59.495
and I'm going home to my mummy."

01:59.537 --> 02:01.706
That was me. I wrote that email!

02:01.748 --> 02:05.668
That's too bad, but we press on.
We're on to stage two of the study.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.087
I'm going to teach you some
philosophical principals

02:08.129 --> 02:11.758
and then we will explore how those ideas have
affected your personal moral machineries.

02:11.841 --> 02:13.968
Sorry, Eleanor, did you say something?

02:14.052 --> 02:17.013
No, it's my chair.
It's got this weird design...

02:17.055 --> 02:19.140
- Your chair smells bad.
- I know!

02:19.182 --> 02:22.644
See? Another person who agrees,
it's the chair.

02:29.525 --> 02:31.277
Great news, everyone!

02:31.861 --> 02:34.864
The funding from the Neuroscience
department came through!

02:35.031 --> 02:36.950
And you blew it all on cupcakes?

02:37.200 --> 02:38.910
Exactly what I would have done.

02:38.993 --> 02:39.911
Respect.

02:40.161 --> 02:42.247
- Eleanor?
- Ah... I'm good.

02:42.455 --> 02:46.709
I try to avoid pointless group activities,
you know, like office Christmas parties

02:46.751 --> 02:47.627
or jury duty.

02:47.877 --> 02:51.172
To me, the single most awful sound
in the universe is that mangled

02:51.214 --> 02:54.133
opening note of your co-workers singing
"Happy Birthday".

02:54.175 --> 02:55.301
Cool stance.

02:55.385 --> 02:58.012
Counterpoint -
these are delicious free cupcakes.

02:58.054 --> 02:59.347
Get over yourself and eat one.

02:59.889 --> 03:00.765
Fine.

03:00.807 --> 03:02.767
Oh! You guys, let's take a picture!

03:02.809 --> 03:05.728
Everyone get in, get in, and say, uh... Oh!

03:05.853 --> 03:08.189
Say "ventromedial prefrontal cortex"!

03:10.358 --> 03:11.442
Jaguars rule!

03:15.822 --> 03:18.908
<i>Hey, Teach? I've been having
so much fun here, but...</i>

03:18.950 --> 03:23.079
I didn't plan to stay in Australia this long,
and I'm super broke.

03:23.162 --> 03:25.331
Any idea where I can get a part-time gig?

03:25.707 --> 03:28.710
- What kind of work are you looking for?
- Well, I'm really good at telemarketing.

03:28.876 --> 03:33.089
I can usually guess how long to microwave
food without looking at the box.

03:33.464 --> 03:35.341
I'd say those are my two main skills.

03:35.383 --> 03:36.342
OK.

03:36.467 --> 03:38.344
- Dang it!
<i>- I'll see what I can do.</i>

03:38.636 --> 03:40.805
If Eleanor has to get a job,
she'll miss class

03:40.847 --> 03:42.890
and that'll slow down her progress.

03:45.518 --> 03:48.104
Are you sure we should be doing this?
It kind of feels like cheating.

03:48.146 --> 03:49.772
No, no, it's not cheating.

03:50.231 --> 03:54.736
Think of us as a snowplough,
clearing a path for Eleanor

03:54.819 --> 03:58.364
so she can more easily drive along
the road of improvement.

03:58.406 --> 04:01.576
Ooh, I love that!
You really painted a picture there.

04:01.659 --> 04:03.077
G'day, how can I help you?

04:03.119 --> 04:05.872
One scratch-off lottery ticket, please!

04:07.123 --> 04:08.958
Oh! Not that one. Keep going.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.918
Keep going. Keep going.

04:11.878 --> 04:13.880
These tickets were printed
before we got down here.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.006
I know which ones are the winners!

04:15.340 --> 04:16.424
And... stop!

04:16.466 --> 04:19.677
That's the one. Good ol' lucky
number 186 from the bottom!

04:20.470 --> 04:21.804
- Here you go.
- Also!

04:21.846 --> 04:24.599
That bathroom key that you lost
nine months ago, slid under the register.

04:25.016 --> 04:28.811
And the woman that you think is your aunt
is actually your mum.

04:28.853 --> 04:29.729
OK, bye!

04:32.023 --> 04:33.858
You guys, this is nuts.

04:34.108 --> 04:38.279
This morning, I found a lottery ticket
on the ground outside my apartment.

04:38.363 --> 04:39.906
I scratched it off...

04:39.989 --> 04:43.242
and I won $18,000!

04:43.326 --> 04:44.786
- Wow!
- That's amazing!

04:44.869 --> 04:46.162
Better luck next time.

04:48.122 --> 04:52.585
Yes. Sorry, from context, I see
that is actually a large sum of money.

05:00.927 --> 05:03.388
Jason? You OK there, mate?

05:04.138 --> 05:05.223
No.

05:05.473 --> 05:09.352
I have to watch the Jaguar games alone,
on my computer at like three in the morning

05:09.394 --> 05:11.687
on Mondays. It's so annoying.

05:11.729 --> 05:13.231
Everything here is in a...

05:13.648 --> 05:15.900
I don't know how to describe it, like...

05:16.025 --> 05:18.194
a different zone of time.

05:18.569 --> 05:20.363
No, that sounds stupid.

05:20.863 --> 05:22.073
A different clock land.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.908
I'll watch the game with you, Jason!

05:23.991 --> 05:27.745
I enjoy American football -
I actually dated a player once.

05:27.829 --> 05:30.832
But he wasn't my type,
so I set him up with my friend Gisele...

05:31.999 --> 05:34.001
- Bündchen.
- Yeah, we got it. We always get it.

05:34.127 --> 05:35.002
Awesome!

05:35.044 --> 05:38.214
But if you want to watch with me,
you have to learn my Jaguars cheer.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.633
It goes, "Let's go, Jags!

05:40.675 --> 05:42.844
Kick their ass! Yeah!"

05:43.302 --> 05:45.304
Do you think you can learn that
by the weekend?

05:45.471 --> 05:47.306
I shall do my best.

05:47.390 --> 05:48.850
Nice! See you then!

05:50.143 --> 05:53.146
- Why do you want to watch football with Jason?
- I don't, really.

05:53.187 --> 05:56.357
But I am, these days,
as you might say in America

05:57.024 --> 05:58.067
"mad horny".

05:58.109 --> 05:59.360
Oh!

05:59.444 --> 06:01.487
<i>- OK, well...</i>
- Oh, boy.

06:01.571 --> 06:03.948
No judgements, babe.
He's a straight hottie.

06:03.990 --> 06:07.785
<i>- You want to smash Jason, go smash.</i>
- Tahani getting together with Jason

06:07.869 --> 06:10.913
even casually, could tear this group apart.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.832
We have to nip this in the bud.

06:12.957 --> 06:16.377
Well, it makes me slightly uneasy
to interfere in the personal life

06:16.419 --> 06:19.422
of the man that I am secretly in love with
and a woman I admire

06:19.464 --> 06:22.091
but if <i>you</i> think we should,
I-I'm not gonna argue.

06:22.133 --> 06:24.760
Time to break out
the ol' snowplough again, Janet.

06:25.344 --> 06:28.890
Let's find Tahani a loving,
supportive companion.

06:28.931 --> 06:29.807
Great idea.

06:29.849 --> 06:32.101
Oh, you know, this is not as crucial
to the mission

06:32.143 --> 06:36.647
but I'd also love to arrange for them to get
better computers, help them work faster.

06:36.689 --> 06:40.193
If I'm going to the mall anyway, I might
as well pick Jason up some jean shorts

06:40.276 --> 06:42.904
the kind with the frayed edges,
where you can see the pockets

06:42.945 --> 06:43.905
coming out the bottom?

06:45.406 --> 06:48.326
So that he can... study better.

06:48.659 --> 06:49.535
Sure.

06:53.164 --> 06:55.249
Tahani? Is that you?

06:55.958 --> 06:59.253
Larry Hemsworth? My goodness!

06:59.337 --> 07:02.840
That's so funny, I just got a call from
the restaurant about a jacket I left here

07:02.882 --> 07:05.259
and now here you are!

07:05.468 --> 07:06.969
I can't believe you remember me.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.263
Of course I remember you! We dated.

07:09.305 --> 07:12.350
I know, I just never expect anyone
to remember me.

07:12.517 --> 07:15.895
Because I'm only 6ft 4",
and I have one of those forgettable faces.

07:16.062 --> 07:19.315
Well, uh... I'm sure you're busy,
probably don't wanna talk to me.

07:19.357 --> 07:21.692
I get it, I wouldn't either,
I'm as dull as a rock.

07:21.776 --> 07:24.779
Ugh. Even that analogy was
boring, I'm sorry.

07:24.862 --> 07:27.240
I'm so dull, and I'm ugly,
I'm like a rock... urgh!

07:27.323 --> 07:30.576
- Stupid Larry! Stop talking about rocks!
- No, no, Larry, please!

07:30.701 --> 07:34.664
It's lovely to see you.
Sit down, let's catch up!

07:34.872 --> 07:36.499
How are Chris and Liam and Luke?

07:37.375 --> 07:38.626
Sorry, no.

07:38.668 --> 07:40.419
I won't mention your brothers again.

07:40.545 --> 07:42.129
As long as you don't mention my sister!

07:42.171 --> 07:43.965
Oh!

07:44.799 --> 07:45.967
Mm-mm...

07:46.133 --> 07:48.261
Who are you? Do you work here?

07:48.719 --> 07:50.429
Your name is Montgomery Wycoff.

07:50.555 --> 07:53.975
Your ex-wife Samantha still loves you
but she's afraid to call.

07:54.267 --> 07:56.435
You must show her your poetry.

07:56.936 --> 07:58.938
Go to her. Go to her!

08:03.609 --> 08:06.237
- Looks like you had a good night!
- I did.

08:06.404 --> 08:09.532
You and Jason, imagine that.

08:10.616 --> 08:11.701
To be fair, I have.

08:11.951 --> 08:14.120
Actually, I was with an ex-boyfriend.

08:14.287 --> 08:19.250
I ran into him unexpectedly,
and the reunion was a "smashing" success.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.252
It's a pun, you see.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.713
- We had intercourse.
- Yeah, again, I always get it.

08:23.921 --> 08:27.425
I do feel bad, though. I completely forgot
about watching the game with Jason.

08:28.009 --> 08:29.343
Homies, guess what?

08:29.427 --> 08:32.221
Yesterday I got a Facebook invite
to the Australia chapter

08:32.305 --> 08:34.640
of the Jacksonville Jaguars Fan Club!

08:34.724 --> 08:36.017
Yeah, I think he's over it.

08:36.142 --> 08:39.895
Me and two other dudes just watched
the Jags annihilate the Texans!

08:40.021 --> 08:42.732
It was super fun, I'm completely wasted.

08:42.815 --> 08:46.527
I gotta go barf one last time,
and then I'll be ready to learn philosophy!

08:46.986 --> 08:48.821
<i>Duval!</i>

08:49.155 --> 08:51.907
OK, not perfect,
but the pros outweigh the cons.

08:51.991 --> 08:52.867
Agreed.

08:54.410 --> 08:58.164
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Chidi ♪</i>

08:58.289 --> 09:01.292
You guys, this whole year has been amazing
for all of us.

09:01.375 --> 09:04.462
I mean, literally every aspect of our lives
has improved.

09:04.545 --> 09:07.214
Well, I don't know about every aspect...

09:07.340 --> 09:08.674
SuperBoard, activate!

09:08.799 --> 09:11.010
<i>Good morning, Professor Anagonye.</i>

09:11.052 --> 09:12.928
<i>I have your lesson plan ready to go.</i>

09:13.012 --> 09:16.140
SuperBoard,
some triumphant announcement music, please.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.645
Last night, Larry Hemsworth proposed to me

09:20.686 --> 09:23.481
and we're moving back to London
to begin planning the wedding!

09:23.648 --> 09:25.232
- Whoa!
- Holy smokes!

09:25.274 --> 09:26.317
Janet! Red alert!

09:26.859 --> 09:29.278
All snowploughing has to stop immediately!

09:29.362 --> 09:32.365
So, don't give Blake Beartles to Jason?

09:36.661 --> 09:40.873
How are you even lugging this thing around?
I'm not sure I could bench this much weight.

09:40.998 --> 09:44.585
Well, girls in my social class
begin ring-training at a very young age.

09:44.794 --> 09:48.464
Oh, I'm throwing a little engagement party
tonight at my Airbnb.

09:48.547 --> 09:51.133
It's very last minute,
just come as you are.

09:54.178 --> 09:57.932
I guess all these people...
came as they were?

09:58.599 --> 10:01.977
Hello, everyone! I'm so glad you made it!

10:02.061 --> 10:05.147
Holy crap, Tahani,
you found this place on Airbnb?

10:05.648 --> 10:08.317
Oh, no. I... I see why you're confused.

10:08.401 --> 10:11.320
I used Heir BnB. "H-E-I-R."

10:11.487 --> 10:16.200
It's an app for heirs and heiresses
where we swap mansions, private islands

10:16.450 --> 10:18.202
blimp hangars, that sort of thing.

10:18.369 --> 10:22.998
Anyway, everyone,
I want you to meet Larry Hemsworth!

10:23.124 --> 10:25.668
Oh! The legendary study group.

10:26.127 --> 10:29.630
I'm sorry it's taken me so long
to build up the courage to meet you.

10:29.714 --> 10:31.882
I guess you can see why.

10:32.049 --> 10:36.971
Is he ashamed at having a perfect jawline
and 0% body fat?

10:37.012 --> 10:39.056
Still can't believe she
wants to marry me...

10:39.223 --> 10:42.059
A dumb old paediatric surgeon
who barely has an eight-pack.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.438
Do you know what you look like?

10:45.604 --> 10:49.400
More importantly, did Miley Cyrus
write the song "Wrecking Ball"

10:49.483 --> 10:50.693
about Chris's brother Liam?

10:51.652 --> 10:52.653
Wonderful.

10:52.987 --> 10:55.281
More questions about my talented brothers.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.616
God forbid there's a single day
when I'm the special one.

10:58.284 --> 11:01.120
Oh, sweetheart, don't go!
You're important too!

11:01.328 --> 11:04.331
Fixing babies' spines
is just as valuable as acting!

11:04.874 --> 11:07.668
Tahani booked a flight
for tomorrow morning, so...

11:08.127 --> 11:10.880
this party is our only chance
to talk them out of moving.

11:11.088 --> 11:13.215
Maybe we should just let them
go their separate ways

11:13.257 --> 11:15.384
and hope that they learned enough
to get into the Good Place.

11:15.468 --> 11:18.888
No, we know what'll happen -
the group splits up, they're screwed. No.

11:18.971 --> 11:23.726
We have to isolate Larry and convince him
that he needs to stay in Australia.

11:23.809 --> 11:25.811
Time to get into character, as...

11:25.853 --> 11:27.646
Nathaniel Cookswell, mate!

11:27.730 --> 11:29.482
Caterer to the stars!

11:29.565 --> 11:30.441
Ah.

11:31.609 --> 11:32.985
Maybe no accent?

11:34.653 --> 11:35.529
Fine.

11:37.072 --> 11:38.240
Vegemite canapé?

11:38.657 --> 11:40.159
Oh, might as well.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.870
Mummy was right.
I'll always be the chubby one.

11:44.163 --> 11:47.416
Good day, mate! Nathaniel Cookswell.

11:47.458 --> 11:49.126
- Caterer to the stars.
- Mm...

11:49.210 --> 11:51.212
Is it true you're moving to England?

11:51.378 --> 11:53.214
Yeah. Fly out tomorrow.

11:53.297 --> 11:55.049
Oh. Ooh, that's a long trip.

11:55.299 --> 11:58.385
Well, you must be a confident man,
uprooting your life like that.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.429
You should stay here in Sydney.

12:00.513 --> 12:04.725
It's such a dynamic international city
that you've only seen 4.8% percent of...

12:05.935 --> 12:06.977
probably.

12:07.061 --> 12:11.065
I reckon I know what's going on here.
You aren't real caterers, are you?

12:11.315 --> 12:12.983
- Uh...
- Uh-uh...

12:13.108 --> 12:15.361
Who do you work for? Australian Inquirer?

12:15.694 --> 12:16.862
TM-Zed?

12:17.071 --> 12:19.824
You just want us to stay here
so you can keep mocking me

12:20.115 --> 12:22.159
"The hideous shame
of the Hemsworth family."

12:22.368 --> 12:24.328
- Aw...
- Tahani sees through all that.

12:24.620 --> 12:27.915
And I can't wait until we move far away
from the likes of you

12:28.040 --> 12:30.251
and I can finally take her last name.

12:32.586 --> 12:35.840
Hate to say it,
but the group probably needs a new member.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.842
I dunno how we'll ever replace Tahani.

12:38.008 --> 12:40.469
Do you think Margot Robbie
is into philosophy?

12:40.594 --> 12:43.138
Actually, Tahani's announcement
made us take stock.

12:43.806 --> 12:46.976
You know, Simone and I need time
to analyse the data

12:47.059 --> 12:49.895
apply for grants -
we've kind of hit a natural stopping point.

12:49.979 --> 12:52.815
Yeah, and the next step would be to repeat
the experiment with new subjects

12:52.857 --> 12:53.941
you know, compare results.

12:54.024 --> 12:57.570
Wait, what are you saying?
That... the study's over?

12:57.987 --> 12:58.946
We're... splitting up?

12:59.238 --> 13:02.324
No, no, no.
We're just taking a break, for...

13:02.533 --> 13:04.034
a year or so.

13:04.159 --> 13:06.704
And I'm sure you're all anxious
to get back home.

13:07.329 --> 13:10.207
Yeah, I got a lot of stuff
to get back to in Phoenix.

13:10.708 --> 13:11.625
Like...

13:12.835 --> 13:15.588
I have a free punch card
at my spray tan place.

13:16.672 --> 13:19.675
They'll do my left side for free... so...

13:21.886 --> 13:23.220
No, no, no, no!

13:23.470 --> 13:25.514
The whole group is splintering!

13:25.764 --> 13:27.308
OK, new emergency plan.

13:27.683 --> 13:29.977
I'll deal with Eleanor,
I... I... I know it's risky

13:30.060 --> 13:31.687
but I don't think she'll recognise me.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.606
And I'll deal with Sweet Cheeks.
I mean, Jason's butt!

13:33.689 --> 13:35.441
I mean, Jason.

13:42.907 --> 13:44.450
- Shrimp?
- Always.

13:45.784 --> 13:48.621
- So... how do you know Miss Al-Jamil?
- Mmm.

13:48.829 --> 13:51.540
- You work with her at the university?
- Used to.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.250
That study is done-zo.

13:53.459 --> 13:56.253
I was finally starting to figure things out

13:56.545 --> 14:00.424
and now I have to start over from scratch.

14:00.925 --> 14:01.926
Again.

14:02.092 --> 14:05.596
Boy, I know how that goes -
not wanting something to end.

14:05.721 --> 14:10.976
Feeling like your little team is the last
thing standing between you and oblivion

14:11.268 --> 14:14.313
that at any moment,
the universe could fold up around you

14:14.396 --> 14:18.233
and squeeze the last breath
from your dying lungs.

14:18.734 --> 14:20.653
You're a caterer, right?

14:20.819 --> 14:22.780
It's a very competitive industry.

14:22.905 --> 14:26.492
The-the point is, I bet that if the study
means that much to you

14:26.742 --> 14:28.661
it means a lot to everyone else.

14:29.244 --> 14:32.665
You're all just probably waiting
for someone to say it out loud.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.085
You want some cocktail sauce with that?

14:38.462 --> 14:42.841
I would like to acknowledge the wonderful
group of people who brought me here.

14:43.008 --> 14:44.843
If I hadn't decided
to get out of the spotlight

14:44.885 --> 14:48.180
of my "Get Out of the Spotlight" Tour,
and come here

14:48.222 --> 14:52.601
and join the Brainy Bunch,
I never would have reconnected with Larry.

14:52.768 --> 14:55.813
- Aww!
- So, to celebrate our group...

14:55.980 --> 14:59.358
I had my favourite pâtissier whip this up.

15:01.026 --> 15:02.528
Would any of you like to say a few words?

15:03.070 --> 15:04.822
Eleanor!

15:04.905 --> 15:06.073
Yay! Eleanor!

15:06.156 --> 15:08.409
If nobody minds, uh...

15:09.034 --> 15:11.286
I would like to address...

15:11.412 --> 15:13.831
the people on this cake, I suppose.

15:14.957 --> 15:18.669
I get that we all have meaningful lives
outside the study.

15:18.794 --> 15:22.172
Well, Tahani and Chidi do.
Jason and I are straight trash.

15:22.423 --> 15:24.091
- Ka-kaw!
- But, just...

15:24.258 --> 15:28.053
I mean, think about how much progress
we've all made since that picture was taken.

15:28.804 --> 15:34.059
I know that what we're doing is important,
and I'm not ready to stop.

15:34.435 --> 15:36.478
And I don't think you guys are either.

15:37.062 --> 15:40.482
So let's all stay here, and keep it going.

15:41.650 --> 15:42.693
What do you say?

15:43.027 --> 15:43.944
Eleanor!

15:44.111 --> 15:47.531
That was absolutely... lovely.

15:47.948 --> 15:50.701
It really was. And I am...
I'm so glad that this study

15:50.743 --> 15:51.869
meant that much to you.

15:53.537 --> 15:55.080
But, realistically--

15:55.164 --> 15:57.124
That's cool. I get it.
No, you don't need to say it. I...

15:57.166 --> 15:58.667
I got it. That's all she wrote. Cool.

15:58.834 --> 16:01.045
Are you OK? I hope you're not mad.

16:01.170 --> 16:03.172
No, I'm not mad. I'm actually laughing.

16:03.464 --> 16:08.010
Because this whole study was a hilarious,
stupid, pointless joke

16:08.135 --> 16:11.138
and now it's over, so let's hit the road.
I don't need you guys.

16:11.263 --> 16:13.348
You don't need me,
and since you don't need me

16:13.474 --> 16:16.435
I'm just gonna take the "me"
out of this cake.

16:17.394 --> 16:18.771
No!

16:18.812 --> 16:20.022
Eleanor, please!

16:20.064 --> 16:21.774
Oh, sorry, the deed is done!

16:21.857 --> 16:22.983
Pip pip, too late!

16:23.067 --> 16:24.693
Ah, farewell to you, my liege.

16:24.777 --> 16:28.614
And a jolly good Saint Ploopington's Day
to all of you!

16:29.156 --> 16:32.993
USA! USA! USA!

16:39.083 --> 16:40.876
Eleanor? Is that you?

16:41.376 --> 16:42.294
No.

16:43.462 --> 16:47.049
Called a cab like 20 minutes ago.

16:47.132 --> 16:51.637
It says it's ten kilometres away,
which is... I don't even know how far.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.430
It's a little over six miles.

16:53.597 --> 16:58.018
Is that why you came out here?
To scold me about the metric system?

16:58.227 --> 17:00.354
No, I was about to call a cab myself.

17:00.437 --> 17:03.816
I have an early class tomorrow.
Then I saw my friend hiding behind a plant

17:03.857 --> 17:06.735
and I got concerned,
then my friend lashed out at me again

17:06.777 --> 17:10.447
so, I'm gonna take off and, uh,
leave her here with dirty leaves in her hair.

17:10.781 --> 17:12.199
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...

17:12.241 --> 17:14.118
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, don't go.

17:18.580 --> 17:21.125
You're a brain scientist.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.294
Can you tell me why I did that in there?

17:24.378 --> 17:26.588
I mostly do clinical research
in neuroscience.

17:26.672 --> 17:28.882
I don't really specialise
in temper tantrums.

17:29.174 --> 17:32.177
Maybe you need a child psychologist,
or a binkie?

17:32.261 --> 17:33.762
That's a solid burn. I deserved it.

17:33.846 --> 17:36.682
I did. But please, can you help me?

17:37.349 --> 17:38.642
Why did I do that?

17:39.309 --> 17:40.519
OK, here's my guess.

17:41.145 --> 17:45.190
As humans evolved, the first big problem
we had to overcome was "me versus us"

17:45.315 --> 17:48.944
learning to sacrifice a little individual
freedom for the benefit of a group.

17:49.069 --> 17:52.239
You know, like sharing food and resources
so we don't starve

17:52.281 --> 17:56.493
- or get eaten by tigers, things like that.
- OK, with you so far.

17:57.035 --> 17:59.204
The next problem to overcome
was "us versus them"

17:59.246 --> 18:02.291
trying to see other groups,
different from ours, as equals.

18:02.374 --> 18:04.168
That one, we're still struggling with.

18:04.251 --> 18:07.087
It's why we have racism and nationalism,
and...

18:07.421 --> 18:10.132
why fans of Stone Cold Steve Austin
hate fans of The Rock.

18:10.215 --> 18:12.551
No, we hate The Rock
because he went Hollywood

18:12.593 --> 18:15.846
and Stone Cold keeps it real,
so The Rock's fans are the real jabronis.

18:17.014 --> 18:18.348
Point made. Keep going.

18:18.432 --> 18:20.809
Well, what's interesting about you is...

18:21.685 --> 18:24.980
I don't think you ever got past
the "me versus us" stage.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.983
I mean, have you ever been part of a group
that you really cared about?

18:28.108 --> 18:30.277
- I was in the Girl Scouts.
- Really?

18:31.028 --> 18:35.157
Technically, I joined under a fake name
because I wanted to steal a bunch of cookies.

18:35.240 --> 18:39.536
See? The Brainy Bunch is basically the first
group that became part of your self-identity

18:39.578 --> 18:43.081
and now that's breaking up,
you're feeling this new kind of loss.

18:43.332 --> 18:45.584
And you're scared
of going back to being alone.

18:45.709 --> 18:48.503
I mean, that's just my guess -
the other possible medical diagnosis

18:48.545 --> 18:50.631
is that you're just a bit of a dick.

18:54.635 --> 18:56.053
Why don't you take my cab?

18:56.553 --> 18:59.097
I think "me" needs to go apologise to "us."

18:59.765 --> 19:00.891
And thank you.

19:03.769 --> 19:07.856
The point is...
I'm not really an "I'm sorry" type girl.

19:08.065 --> 19:11.485
I'm more of a,
"It's your fault your car got keyed

19:11.526 --> 19:13.987
in the movie theatre parking lot
because you wouldn't shut up

19:14.029 --> 19:16.990
while watching John Wick"... type girl.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.868
But... I'm sorry that I freaked out.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.037
Just really gonna miss you guys.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.081
We're gonna miss you too.

19:24.623 --> 19:28.168
Here's an idea - what if we all agree
to a yearly reunion?

19:28.418 --> 19:30.379
And then that way,
The Brainy Bunch never dies!

19:30.587 --> 19:34.424
Each summer, we could all stay
in one of our respective houses

19:34.508 --> 19:37.052
mega-yachts, ski chalets, what have you.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.720
We should all meet up in Jacksonville!

19:38.845 --> 19:40.472
My house is right on the water.

19:40.764 --> 19:43.100
It didn't used to be,
but the whole city is a swamp

19:43.141 --> 19:44.893
- and it's sinking into the ocean!
- Woo!

19:44.977 --> 19:46.520
Strong pitch, bud.

19:46.687 --> 19:48.105
Next year in Jacksonville.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.147
Yeah!

19:49.314 --> 19:52.734
Uh, we might not want to wait a whole year -
it's sinking really fast.

19:52.776 --> 19:55.028
We should have a toast!

19:55.070 --> 19:58.115
OK, I think I figured out a plan
where they stay in Australia

19:58.156 --> 20:01.034
and only five random bystanders get hurt.

20:01.285 --> 20:03.370
It's called "arson." Let's go!

20:03.495 --> 20:06.540
Michael, no.
We can't keep meddling forever.

20:06.623 --> 20:10.168
It's time to park the snowplough,
and trust that the humans

20:10.210 --> 20:11.670
will make progress on their own.

20:12.004 --> 20:14.589
This isn't like your afterlife
Neighbourhood, Michael.

20:14.631 --> 20:18.844
You can't just reset things the moment
something doesn't go according to your plan.

20:20.178 --> 20:22.556
Oh, Janet, you're a genius.

20:22.639 --> 20:24.308
Correct. I know everything.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.476
You just gave me this crazy idea.

20:26.560 --> 20:29.271
It's so crazy, it just might... fail.
It'll probably fail.

20:29.396 --> 20:33.358
But it also might work!
I open the door to the afterlife.

20:33.442 --> 20:36.653
You keep a lookout,
while I break into the Judge's chamber

20:36.737 --> 20:40.490
and reset the timeline on Earth.
Then we do it all over again!

20:40.532 --> 20:43.368
But correctly - we won't wait a year
to get them all together again.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.911
We'll get the study going right away!

20:44.995 --> 20:47.205
Do you even know how to reset
the timeline on Earth?

20:48.457 --> 20:50.751
No. I'm assuming that there's, you know...

20:50.917 --> 20:53.545
a knob or a... or a button or, you know,
maybe you...

20:53.712 --> 20:55.464
maybe you unplug it
and then plug it right back in?

20:55.547 --> 20:57.632
I-I don't... There's gotta be a way!

20:57.674 --> 20:59.051
Michael, before you do this--

20:59.092 --> 21:00.427
No! No more waiting.

21:00.635 --> 21:02.429
This is all we have, Janet.

21:02.512 --> 21:06.391
We have Chidi and Eleanor
and Tahani and Jason

21:06.475 --> 21:07.893
and that is it.

21:08.060 --> 21:11.938
If we can't get them enough afterlife
points to get them into the Good Place

21:12.022 --> 21:15.525
then there's no point in us
even being here. We have to try.

21:15.901 --> 21:17.569
OK. Let's do this.

21:17.861 --> 21:18.737
O-OK.

21:23.075 --> 21:24.576
What the hell is that?

21:24.659 --> 21:26.536
Oh! Hey, guys!

21:26.953 --> 21:28.455
What are you doing down here?
