[telephone ringing]

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
[ringing continues]

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
[machine beeps]

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
[Horst speaking in German]

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
[in English]

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
You have reached the award

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
winning Eismann Gallery.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
We will be closed

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
due to an acute

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
and unexpected infestation

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
from the 13th of the month

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
until further notice.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
[coughing]

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
[continues coughing]

01:58.000 --> 01:58.000
Thank you.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
[machine beeps]

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
[Cliff screaming]

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
[grunts in pain]

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
I'm going to kill

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
that motherfucker. [sighs]

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
[Rita] My bees.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
My bees!

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
[gibbering]

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
[laughing] My bees.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
My bees?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
[knocking at door]

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Oh, Rita!

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Thank God, you're home.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Mickey.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
You look a fright,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
what's the matter?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
The long and short of it is

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Isabel got run over

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
by a tractor trailer.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
-How awful--

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
-I was gonna

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
cancel the show but then

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I'd have to eat the deposit

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
on the theater and...

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
[clicks tongue]

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
What do you say?

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Can you take over the role

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
of the Blob Lady?

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Mickey, a cast is a team.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
When one of our ranks falls,

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
it's up to the others

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
-to carry--

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
-It's a yes

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
or no question, doll.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
Yes! I'd be honored

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
for the good of the team.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Thanks, kid.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
[woman] You're welcome.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
[whispers]

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Mother.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
What are you doing here?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Saving your career.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
What else?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
[scoffs] I beg your pardon.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
[mimics Rita]

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
I beg your pardon.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Don't you dare

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
put on those airs with me,

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Gertrude Cramp.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
I hope you know

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
you weren't Mickey's

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
first choice to replace

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
that little harpy.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
But I changed her mind.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Changed her mind, how?

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
I think we both know

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
the answer to that.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
[gasps]

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Bullshit!

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
What's up?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Nothing.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Um...

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
It's just...

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
when you said you live

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
with a mummy,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
I thought you

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
were exaggerating.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
[chuckles]

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Oh, hell no.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
If anything, I downplayed

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
most of what I told you

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
about this place.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Come on.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Yo, Larry!

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
You okay?

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
[sighs] Not since

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
the early '60s, no.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
[chuckles]

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Uh, this is Roni.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Hey.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Hello.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
We'll just...

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
let you keep doing...

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
whatever.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
We're looking for Niles,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
you know where he is?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
[Larry] Space.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
As in, outer?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Mmm-hmm.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Any idea when he'll be back?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Come on.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Bye.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
[sighs]

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
[Rita] My bees.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
My bees!

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
My bees.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
-My bees?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
-Hey, Rita!

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
You have got to

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
try this frittata.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
They will change your life.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
[Vic] This is Roni,

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
by the way.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
-Hello.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
-Hi.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
And which one are you?

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Oh, my God, you're Rita Farr.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I'm sorry.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
I'm Miranda.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
-Hmm.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
-Apparently she's

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
an amazing cook.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Where's Jane?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
She's taking some time

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
for herself.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Really?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
I just can't believe

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
I'm actually talking to you

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
right now.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
I'm such a big fan.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Oh, don't be nervous, dear.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Celebrities are just like

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
regular people.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Well, not really.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
What's with the get-up?

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
I'm preparing for a role

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
in a local production.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
The Cloverton beekeeper

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
has graciously agreed to let me

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
shadow her today.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
[clears throat]

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
I also had to subscribe

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
to her Honey of the Month club.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Are those pancakes I see?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
I made them special

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
for Dorothy...

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
as a peace offering.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
I want her to know that

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
everyone in the Underground

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
wants to find a way to work

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
through this, together.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
-What's the Underground?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
-Oh, it's a place, uh...

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
inside Jane's mind.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Anyone know where Dorothy is?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
[Larry] Yeah, space.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
-Chief's on it.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
-Oh.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
I best be off.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Okay. Um...

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Okay, I've seen a lot of shit.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
But this...

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
y'all ain't right.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I wish I could say

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
you get used to it, but...

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
[doorbell rings]

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
[Larry] What is it?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
It's a crate, Larry.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
[sniffs]

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Did anyone else just feel

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
something weird

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
go up their nose?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Or is that some status quo shit

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
around here too?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
-I felt it.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
-[Larry] Yeah.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Okay.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
-Let's open this bad boy up

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
and see what's what.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
-Wait.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
It says "do not open"

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
on the front

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
and on the side...

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
and on the back.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Maybe we should wait

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
for Niles. Yeah.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Yeah, I'm with Vic.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
I... I can't explain it

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
but it...

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
It feels like

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
a really good idea

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
to open that crate.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Yeah. Me too.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Well, let's get

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
this party started.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
No, no, wait.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
[Larry] Is that the painting

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
that ate Danny?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
[Vic] Hold on.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Where's Mr. Nobody

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
and the Beard Hunter?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
That's too bad.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I was really looking forward

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
to catching up with those guys.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
[Larry] Oh, yeah,

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
that would have been nice.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
[Niles]  Slept all the way

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
through our landing,

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
didn't you?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Dream well, dear girl.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I'll be back.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
[beeps]

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
[wind blowing]

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
[Cliff] Fine!

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
I'll fucking walk.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
fuck, fuck!

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
God damn, mother...

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Piece of shit.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I'm going to kill him.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
I'm gonna kill him.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
I...

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
am going...

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
-to kill...

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
-[bird cawing]

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
What the fuck?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Get back! Fuck!

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I'm going to kill him.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
I'm gonna kill that bird.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Then I'm gonna

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
fucking kill him.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
[Rita] Good morning.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Morning.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
You must be the actress.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Actress, storyteller,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
student of character,

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
pleasure to meet you.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Mmm.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Are they gonna have

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
real bees on stage?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
No, I don't think so.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Don't need the outfit, then.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
A ballerina doesn't wear a tutu

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
to a bowling alley.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Terrific point.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
What you writing?

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I like to take notes.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Every bit helps me prepare

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
for my monolog.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Monolog?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
The script you sent me

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
only had one line.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
"My bees."

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Why say it in one line,

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
when you can say it in seven.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
There is so much more

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
to your story, I know it.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Not really.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
The only reason

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I'm in this...

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Rhiannon, where you think

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
you're going?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Don't forget that honey jar.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Got to get Mr. Fusco

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
something sweet

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
so that you don't

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
flunk biology again!

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
You really shouldn't do that.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
-Do what?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
-That.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
The honey.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Using bribery to open doors

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
for your daughter.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
[laughs] Trust me,

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
that girl's as dumb as shit.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Ain't no jar of honey

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
gonna get her into Yale.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
She's your daughter!

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
How dare you say that

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
about her?

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
She's more than just

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
a honey jar.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
She is a person...

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
with hopes and dreams...

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
and potential.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Not bad, Ms. Monolog.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
That coffee tastes like piss.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
I'm gonna get a beer.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
You want a beer?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
-Mmm-hmm

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
-Yeah.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
[sighs]

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Everything all right, Larry?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Well, not really.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Look, I... I don't like

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
to burden people

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
with my problems.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
But you seem like someone

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
I can really open up to.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
You know?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
[sighs]

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
My grandson is in the hospital

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
and my family

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
doesn't want me to see him,

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
mostly because I'm the reason

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
he's in the hospital.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Hmm.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Your family will understand...

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
in time.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
You just have to give them

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
a little space.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
[sighs]

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Yup.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I should go visit them.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
You could.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
But that would be the opposite

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
of giving them space.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Ah.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Jane once told me

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
never to ask

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
her other personas

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
for favors...

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
but you just seem so sweet

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
and I really need to

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
talk to Flit, right now.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Of course.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
[whooshes]

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Hi, I'm here to visit

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Dex Trainor.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Sorry.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
The family isn't taking

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
any visitors right now.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
No, it's okay.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
-I'm his grandfather--

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
-[officer] Freeze!

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
[Larry] Oh, shit.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
-[officer] Hands

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
behind your heads!

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
-[guns cocking]

12:55.000 --> 12:55.000
Get down on your knees!

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
One sec, I got an idea.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
[whooshing]

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
[Larry sighs]

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Maybe this was a mistake.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Now my family hates me.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
The Bureau of Normalcy

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
is hunting me.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
I could never just

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
walk in to a hospital.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Unless...

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Hello,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I'm Dr. Larry Trainor

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
and I'm here to check

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
on my grand--

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Um...

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
-I mean... patient.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
-Patient.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
De...

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Dex Trainor.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Um, could you remind me

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
where he's being treated?

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Um...

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Stat.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
[giggles]

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
[Larry whispers]

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Don't worry.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
They're never going to see

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
through our disguise.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
[guns cocking]

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Um...

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Flit?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
-[agent 1] Oh, you gotta be

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
kidding me.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
-[agent 2] Fuck.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Hold on, wait.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
We can't do this right now.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
-Why not?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
-Because we came here

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
to try and fix you.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Well, yeah, but your...

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
grandpa...

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
dad...

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
friend, he's not here.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Remember?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
-He's in space.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
-It doesn't matter,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
we don't need him.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
He's actually

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
a pretty bad scientist.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
And I'm carrying around

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
the most advanced AI system

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
on the planet.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
I could fix you myself.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
[Miranda] What's up?

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Well, Vic's just offered

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
to perform surgery on me.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Like, himself?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
-Oh, anything

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
we can do to help?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
-[Vic] Hell, yeah.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
-You're already dressed

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
like doctors.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
-[gasps]

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
You ready?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Booyah.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Booyah.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Should probably

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
get you something

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
to bite down on first.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
-Good idea.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
-[Miranda] Hey, again.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Sorry, I know I'm new.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
But are you guys

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
absolutely sure

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
this is a good idea?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Yes.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
I've never been more certain

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
of anything in my whole life.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
It just seems...

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
that everyone,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
including Flit,

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
has been acting strangely,

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
since this morning.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
You're right, Nicer-Jane.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
I have been acting strangely.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
But I think I know why.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Roni,

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
I know we haven't

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
been dating very long,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
I mean, we only slept together

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
two and a half times...

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
but I just can't

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
pretend anymore.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
I love you.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
[Larry] Aw!

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Cut me open, you big softy.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
[Kipling] Oh,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
you fucking twats.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
You did it, didn't you?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
You opened the box.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
The one that's marked

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
"do not open"

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
on the front,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
the back and the sides.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
All caps.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Underlined.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
I thought it was more

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
of a suggestion

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
as opposed to a hard rule.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Anyone else infected?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Infected? With what?

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
-The love bug.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
[sighs in exasperation]

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Scants.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
The painting was crawling

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
with them when we traded it

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
to Horst Eismann,

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
although we didn't know it.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Now, that old Swiss bastard's

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
entire collection

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
is crawling with the buggers.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Only way to clear 'em out

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
is to kill the queen.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
If I don't,

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
Eismann's gonna feed my ass

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
to a zombified alicorn.

16:22.000 --> 16:22.000
What?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Uh, first of all...

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Nice butthole?

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Really makes your eyes pop.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
And second, what exactly

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
are Scants?

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
Niles has an old Templar

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
slideshow in his study.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
It'll tell you everything

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
you need to know.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Now, just sit tight

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
and watch telly

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
till Mommy gets back.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
All right, loves?

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
God help you morons.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
[beeps]

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
[man on TV]  Scants and You.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Have you ever seen a Scant?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Well, I have.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
And I'd like to tell you

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
all about them.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Scants are pink humanoid pests.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Odd-looking fellows,

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
aren't they?

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Scants adhere

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
to a social hierarchy

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
similar to bees.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
There's a queen

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
and the faithful drones

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
that serve her.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Just how do they serve her?

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I'm so glad you asked.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Scants place bad ideas

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
in your head.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
When your brain

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
accepts the bad ideas

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
as good ideas,

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
a pink viscous substance

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
-called Idyat secretes

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
from your ears.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
-[laughs]

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Idyat, however,

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
is only visible to Scants.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
The Scants harvest the Idyat

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
and refine it

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
into its most potent form,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
known as Uma Jelly.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
The queen then feeds upon

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
the Uma Jelly,

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
which gives her a variety

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
of extraordinary powers.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
The only way to clear

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
a Scant infestation

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
is to kill the queen.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
If you discover

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
a Scant infestation,

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
under no circumstances

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
should you approach it

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
unless you have

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
the proper equipment.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
Becoming infected by Scants

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
is extremely dangerous,

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
as the bad ideas will compound

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
and lead to death...

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
dismemberment...

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
and more death.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Thank you

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
for your kind attention.

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
We here at the Knights Templar

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
hope you have a wonderful,

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
Scant-free day.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
[Miranda] This makes

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
so much sense.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
You guys are infected.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Mmm, I don't think so.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
-What?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
-[Roni chuckles]

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
You were about

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
to operate on Roni.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
He had a lab coat on.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
[Vic] Good thing we did.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Now we can help Willoughby

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
kill the Scant queen.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Yes! Great idea.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Vic.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Larry.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
I applaud your heroic spirit.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
But I think it's best

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
if we sit this one out.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Miranda.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
You're great.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
Like, really, really great.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
You are so great.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
But we're gonna need more of

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
a can-do attitude from you.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Okay.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
-We'll do it.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
-Yes!

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
But, before we go

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
into that painting,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
we should come up

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
with a plan, first.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Yeah.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
[Miranda sighs] Okay.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Guys?

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
[wind blowing]

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
[voices whispering

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
indistinctly]

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
[bird cawing]

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
[voices whispering

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
indistinctly]

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
[animal growling]

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Fuck, fuck!

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Fucker ejects me into space?

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
What kinda person does that?

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Asshole person, that's who!

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Has no business

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
looking after a kid.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
None!

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
I ought to do Dorothy

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
and the entire planet a favor

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
by killing the shit

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
out of him.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
Yeah, first I'll eject him

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
into space,

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
then I'll find

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
his stupid body,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
rip off his stupid head

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
and take a mother of all craps

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
down his neck-hole.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Except I can't shit anymore.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Shit! Okay. New plan!

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Eject him into space,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
find his body

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
and a Great Dane

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
with giardia,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
have it take a shit

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
down his neck-hole!

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Yes!

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Revenge by Marmaduke.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
It's happening!

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
[powering down]

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
The fuck?

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
What the fucking fuck?

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Okay, okay, it's stuck,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
first time something

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
like this has happened.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
[babbling]

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Okay.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Here we go.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
[grunting] Come on.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Move, you stupid asshole legs.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
Motherfucker!

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
Seeing one's mother

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
as a sexual being

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
is traumatic enough.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
Seeing her

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
get rigorously boffed

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
by one's producer

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
-is a whole other

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
basket of cheese.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
-I'll bet.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Look, I'm no big city

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
headshrinker.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
But the way I see it,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
you're suffering from

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
a whopping case

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
of imposter syndrome.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Believe me, I'm aware.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
What I can't figure out

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
is how to...

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
just move past it.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
It might help if you saw things

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
through your mom's eyes,

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
for a minute.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
I highly doubt it.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Humor me. See,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
what people don't realize

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
is that their moms

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
are just as stupid as they are.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
But because they

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
squeeze the human being

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
through their pee-hole...

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
they expect them

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
to be super-human.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
My, what a way with words

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
you have.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
A mom can love a kid

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
to the moon and back,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
but it doesn't mean that

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
she knows how to express it

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
in healthy

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
and constructive ways.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
So, when your mom boffed...

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
that producer...

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
she didn't realize that

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
she was shackling you

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
with chronic self-doubt.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I believe she did it

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
because she loved you.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Oh, so that's it?

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
We're just supposed

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
to endure the toxic

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
stupidity of our mothers?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Well, you could...

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
give her a call

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
and tell her how you feel.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Ugh, she's been dead

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
for ages.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
-Oh.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
-She went peacefully

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
in her sleep.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Unfortunately.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
Well, in that case,

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
you need a surrogate.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
For what, precisely?

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
To yell at, dummy.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
To say all the crap

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
that you want to dump

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
on your mother.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
You want me to yell at you?

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
No, not me.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
"My bees."

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
You want me to scream

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
at your bees?

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
It ain't gonna hurt

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
their feelings none.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
You can't believe

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
how cathartic it is.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Sometimes I think

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
that's the only thing

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
that's keeping me

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
from killing that dumb-as-shit

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
kid of mine.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
[Miranda] Hey!

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Hey.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
I know I'm new to the group...

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
and I don't know

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
how you handle...

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
things like this.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
[Larry] Well, typically

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
we just kinda wing it

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
and everything works out.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
And, uh, under

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
typical circumstances

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
I'm sure that's

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
a fine way to go.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
And... [sighs] I'm sorry

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
to keep harping on this,

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
but you guys are infected

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
with bad ideas.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
So, any strong urges

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
you might be having

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
-are probably not good.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
-[man] Shh!

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Beard Hunter?

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Cyborg!

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
-How the heck can you see me?

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
-Hey, wassup, man?

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
-Oh.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
-How you doing?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
-How am I?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
-Yeah.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Uh, well, you know,

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
I've been stuck in this

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
friggin' painting,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
being hunted by

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
tiny pink eunuchs.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
So...

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
how are you?

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Amazing, I'm in love.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
-With her.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
-Okay. Yeah.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
If we can just keep it down,

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
for cripes' sake,

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
it's, uh, a little sketch

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
in here.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Hey, where's Mr. Nobody?

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Oh, yeah,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I would love to meet him.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Yeah, well, you know,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
he got a gig

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
on some animated bullcrap.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
So, haven't seen him since.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Are you infected, too?

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
[scoffs]

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
With Scants?

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
No way, Jose.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
So you thought

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
it was a good idea

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
to just paint the front

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
of your body?

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Pardon me, gentlemen.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
[clears throat]

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Listen, little lady.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
I'm a self-trained

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
shinobi warrior.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
And a semi

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
semi-professional,

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
Fortnite streamer.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Okay.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
So, if anyone knows

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
how to stay hidden...

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
[footsteps approaching]

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Oh, shit.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Scants.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Get behind me, quickly.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Quickly, quickly.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
-Quicker than that.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
-[Scants] Beep!

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
-Help her, she's slow.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
-[Scants] Beep!

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Don't move, if they see us,

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
we're all dead.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
-[inhales sharply]

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
-[Scants] Beep!

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Beep!

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Beep!

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Beep!

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Uh, excuse me.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
-[whispers] What're you doing?

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
-[Scants] Beep!

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
[Larry] Excuse me.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Hi.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
I'm Dr. Larry Trainor.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
No.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
No, that's not right.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Don't worry, guys,

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
I got this.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Name's Vic,

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
aka Cyborg.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
We're a rag-tag group

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
of misfit superheroes

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
hoping to kill your queen.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Can we follow you

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
to your hive?

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Guys?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
We should start running.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
-Beep!

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
