00:19.656 --> 00:22.158
My rise to the top of
the Haden High School food chain

00:22.200 --> 00:24.406
happened faster
than a three-second Snapchat.

00:25.328 --> 00:26.703
But it wasn't always that way.

00:27.539 --> 00:29.662
A few weeks ago, I was just like you,

00:30.291 --> 00:33.625
then I updated my status and some
pretty strange things began to happen.

00:34.629 --> 00:37.381
I feel like I owe everyone
an explanation, so here it is.

00:38.425 --> 00:40.998
Oh, and by the way, I don't play hockey.

00:50.603 --> 00:52.845
Or at least I didn't,
until a few weeks ago.

00:54.482 --> 00:56.226
Oh, come on, kid.

00:56.818 --> 00:59.487
Knock-knock, I'm invading your privacy.

00:59.571 --> 01:01.148
Come on, get up!

01:01.239 --> 01:03.283
You're gonna be late
for your first day of school.

01:03.742 --> 01:05.864
Ugh, it smells like a wet dog in here.

01:05.952 --> 01:07.411
- See that guy?
- Hey!

01:07.495 --> 01:09.073
That was me not so long ago.

01:09.164 --> 01:11.452
Listen, you need to finish
putting this room together

01:11.541 --> 01:15.159
so when you get home from school today,
I want you to start unpacking, all right?

01:16.379 --> 01:18.668
- Breakfast in ten.
- Wait, wait, Mom, Mom!

01:18.757 --> 01:20.630
I don't think I feel so good.

01:20.717 --> 01:21.962
Yeah, right.

01:33.146 --> 01:35.020
- Hey, bud, howyou doing?
- Hey, Dad.

01:35.106 --> 01:36.959
Sorry for hitting you up so early.
Did I wake you?

01:36.983 --> 01:38.394
Aw, please, don't worry about it.

01:38.485 --> 01:40.773
I had to get up early.
Giant swells this morning.

01:40.862 --> 01:42.605
- Everything okay?
- This place sucks.

01:43.323 --> 01:44.633
I wish I could be there with you.

01:44.657 --> 01:47.195
Listen, you just gotta hang tough
till summer, okay?

01:47.285 --> 01:49.454
Then you're gonna be right back here
in Cali with me.

01:50.038 --> 01:51.748
- I love you, Pop.
- I love you, too, man.

01:51.831 --> 01:52.946
Hang in there, all right?

01:57.796 --> 01:59.041
Whoa!

01:59.130 --> 02:00.715
- Oh, well, sorry about that.
- Gramps!

02:00.799 --> 02:02.568
Still getting used to having
people in the house.

02:02.592 --> 02:03.968
Yeah, yeah, I'll come back later.

02:07.388 --> 02:09.676
Don't play with the phone now.

02:09.765 --> 02:11.675
I'm not playing, I'm swiping.

02:12.185 --> 02:13.430
- Swiping?
- Yes.

02:13.520 --> 02:15.845
Get that app off your phone, young lady.

02:15.939 --> 02:17.101
Put it on my phone, though.

02:18.358 --> 02:20.849
Dude, you're gonna wear that
on the first day of school?

02:20.944 --> 02:22.735
This isn't Huntington Beach.

02:22.821 --> 02:24.715
Okay, eat up.
The bus will be here in ten minutes.

02:24.739 --> 02:26.449
I don't know why I couldn't bring my car.

02:26.741 --> 02:28.284
Dad said he'd pay to have it shipped.

02:28.326 --> 02:30.817
Well, I love that money is no object
for your father

02:30.912 --> 02:32.323
because he doesn't make any.

02:32.414 --> 02:36.198
Your dad's need to relax has gotten in
the way of him finding any kind of work.

02:36.292 --> 02:38.000
I get it, you guys are mad at me.

02:38.461 --> 02:41.462
But just bear with me and just trust me.
I have a plan.

02:41.548 --> 02:43.374
This is better for all of us, all right?

02:48.138 --> 02:51.922
Hey, bro! You need to drop
the teen angst act.

02:52.308 --> 02:55.475
Mom and Dad are over.
This is the new normal. Accept it.

02:55.562 --> 02:58.231
Look, they're only separated.
They're not getting a divorce.

02:58.815 --> 03:01.650
She moved 3,000 miles
to get away from him.

03:01.735 --> 03:04.819
To me, that screams divorce,
but then again, I'm a realist.

03:07.699 --> 03:11.198
No surf, no Dad, no car,

03:11.286 --> 03:13.325
senior year in Connecticut.

03:26.885 --> 03:31.381
Twenty three? Room 23?
Does anybody know where Room 23 is?

03:32.265 --> 03:34.258
Sorry, man, my bad.

03:35.852 --> 03:37.454
Hey, do you guys know where Room 23 is?

03:37.479 --> 03:38.641
Cool skateboard.

03:39.063 --> 03:40.308
- Thanks.
- Twenty-three?

03:40.398 --> 03:41.900
- Yeah.
- Isn't that East wing, guys?

03:41.941 --> 03:44.736
- Yeah, I got a class there.
- It's on the other side of the school.

03:44.778 --> 03:46.272
I really appreciate it, dude.

03:46.362 --> 03:49.067
Not a problem... dude.

03:51.951 --> 03:53.529
Come on, come on, where is it?

03:54.913 --> 03:56.390
♪ The fourth the fifth ♪

03:56.414 --> 04:00.494
♪ The minor fall
The major lift ♪

04:00.585 --> 04:05.828
♪ The baffled king composing
Hallelujah ♪

04:09.344 --> 04:10.624
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:10.887 --> 04:13.508
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Well, Mr...

04:14.265 --> 04:15.463
Kyle Moore.

04:15.558 --> 04:18.844
Kyle Moore, I really hope this isn't how
the rest of the year is going to go.

04:18.937 --> 04:21.142
- Mmm-hmm.
- Please have a seat, Kyle.

04:32.867 --> 04:33.910
Great.

04:58.601 --> 04:59.644
Hey.

05:00.270 --> 05:01.468
Hi.

05:03.106 --> 05:06.356
I saw you singing earlier, you were,
you were great.

05:06.943 --> 05:09.232
I was a little flat, but, thank you.

05:09.904 --> 05:12.027
- I'm Kyle.
- I'm Dani.

05:15.827 --> 05:18.199
Are you trying to make me jealous?

05:18.747 --> 05:20.953
Brian, this is Kyle.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.080
Kyle, this is Brian Massey.

05:25.545 --> 05:26.588
Hey, man?

05:26.713 --> 05:29.085
Are you making a play on my girl,
Spray Tan?

05:29.174 --> 05:31.843
Brian, I'm not your girl, okay?
You're gay.

05:32.469 --> 05:36.466
Thirty-seven percent technically ain't
gay, baby and you were flat again today.

05:36.556 --> 05:37.974
Do you wanna win the Slam, or not?

05:38.016 --> 05:39.890
Yes! Of course, I want to win the Slam.

05:39.976 --> 05:41.703
Well, then, mediocrity isn't gonna cut it.

05:41.728 --> 05:43.121
Okay, I'm not taking my shirt off.

05:43.146 --> 05:45.388
I cannot lose
that much water-weight again.

05:45.482 --> 05:47.024
You need to step it up.

05:47.108 --> 05:48.686
Are you wearing women's jeans?

05:50.361 --> 05:51.404
No.

05:54.157 --> 05:56.114
Yes, my stylist picked them out.

05:56.201 --> 05:57.659
Dude, you don't have a stylist.

05:57.744 --> 06:00.199
Okay, H&M had a flash sale, I blacked out.

06:01.706 --> 06:02.749
Later, Kyle.

06:06.419 --> 06:07.504
Don't even think about it.

06:08.421 --> 06:09.915
But you can think about this.

06:25.146 --> 06:28.313
Hey, Kyle, looks like
you're acclimating nicely.

06:28.817 --> 06:31.105
This is my boyfriend, Xing-Fu.

06:31.194 --> 06:34.195
Xing, Mr Unpopular here
is my brother, Kyle.

06:36.199 --> 06:37.301
Where are you from in China?

06:37.325 --> 06:39.614
Oh, no, he's from Connecticut.
His real name's Donald.

06:39.702 --> 06:41.161
But he only speaks Mandarin,

06:41.246 --> 06:43.404
because he's so in tune
with his Chinese roots.

06:43.498 --> 06:44.541
Let's go, Fu.

06:50.672 --> 06:52.249
What are you doing at my table?

06:53.258 --> 06:56.757
- Sorry, I didn't know it was yours.
- Well, it is, so beat it.

06:59.347 --> 07:01.803
Wait, wait, no, no, no, no!
Kidding, I'm kidding.

07:01.891 --> 07:04.299
You thought I was serious?
That was awesome.

07:04.394 --> 07:06.386
No, I'm not...
I'm not a fighter.

07:06.479 --> 07:08.874
I know I look intimidating,
but no, I've never been in a fight.

07:08.898 --> 07:10.625
That's not true.
When I was in third grade,

07:10.650 --> 07:14.315
this girl kicked me in the eggplant emoji

07:14.404 --> 07:17.191
and I just, uh, fell down and cried,

07:17.282 --> 07:19.073
and pee'd a little.

07:19.617 --> 07:22.430
- Thanks for sharing that with me.
- Yeah. Are you really from California?

07:22.454 --> 07:25.408
- Yeah, I really am.
- That is gnarly.

07:25.498 --> 07:27.372
Is that how you say "gnarly"?

07:27.459 --> 07:29.353
- Sure.
- I've always wanted to go to California,

07:29.377 --> 07:31.833
just skateboard, you know?
Like, down the Venice boardwalk

07:31.921 --> 07:33.524
and, like, hang out
with Snoop Dogg, you know?

07:33.548 --> 07:35.956
Straight Outta Compton-style,
except without, you know,

07:36.050 --> 07:37.510
the smokies, because I have asthma.

07:37.594 --> 07:39.752
But anyways, I can't go,
because I sunburn easily

07:39.846 --> 07:41.907
and I'm not really athletic.
I'm talking a lot, sorry.

07:41.931 --> 07:44.387
My name's Lonnie.
Oh, fist bump.

07:44.476 --> 07:45.518
- Sorry.
- Bro.

07:45.602 --> 07:47.641
- But everyone calls me Grimace.
- Why Grimace?

07:47.729 --> 07:49.638
Oh, because everyone thinks
I look like him.

07:49.731 --> 07:50.845
I don't see it, dude.

07:50.940 --> 07:53.645
Uh, dude. I sound like a Californian.

07:53.735 --> 07:54.778
Yo, Grimace?

07:56.029 --> 07:57.191
Hey, Derek.

07:57.530 --> 07:59.190
I got a B-plus on my history paper.

07:59.282 --> 08:01.571
- Yeah, that's not good.
- That's unacceptable.

08:02.243 --> 08:03.951
Stop eating, start studying.

08:06.706 --> 08:07.821
Got it, dude.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.334
You do that guy's homework?

08:10.418 --> 08:13.918
Yeah, Principal Kim makes me
"tutor" him.

08:14.005 --> 08:15.757
He's the best hockey player
in Connecticut.

08:15.799 --> 08:17.791
He scored more
goals in two periods

08:17.884 --> 08:19.924
than any other high schooler in history.

08:20.011 --> 08:22.965
He's got a YouTube channel
and I hear pros are watching him.

08:23.056 --> 08:24.974
And then there's Charlotte,
Derek's girlfriend.

08:25.016 --> 08:26.890
Hottest girl in the whole school.

08:26.976 --> 08:28.969
The queen of Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook.

08:29.062 --> 08:31.517
She's got like half a million followers
on Instagram.

08:31.606 --> 08:33.563
Queen of all the hockey groupies.

08:33.942 --> 08:36.065
They're expected to win
the state championship.

08:36.152 --> 08:38.863
We haven't w on in like 20 years,
so it's all because of that guy.

08:38.905 --> 08:41.063
Yeah, well, I'm not a hockey fan.

08:41.157 --> 08:44.360
Me, neither, but figure skating's cool.
I mean, whatever.

08:44.452 --> 08:45.733
- Yo, Grimace!
- What?

08:49.499 --> 08:51.907
Chocolate money shot!

08:52.001 --> 08:54.290
You got your milk
all over my titties.

08:55.630 --> 08:58.086
Did I forget to mention
he has a really accurate slap shot?

08:58.174 --> 09:00.748
He's good. Do I have anything in my face?

09:01.761 --> 09:05.095
Oh, you got a little something. uh,
right... here.

09:15.108 --> 09:16.816
Yo, Point Break!

09:18.987 --> 09:21.904
Hey. Come on, man.
I'm just messing with you.

09:22.407 --> 09:23.676
All right? It's nothing personal.

09:23.700 --> 09:26.405
We just do it to all the new kids.
So, uh, we cool?

09:29.330 --> 09:30.611
Kyle! Look out!

09:32.417 --> 09:34.125
Five minutes for cross checking!

09:34.210 --> 09:37.496
How's that locker feel, Point Break?

09:37.589 --> 09:39.297
Oh, Cali!

09:39.382 --> 09:41.505
Hey, come on, give me my phone back.

09:41.593 --> 09:43.550
Oh, you wanna call your mommy,
Point Break?

09:43.636 --> 09:45.510
Oh, you can actually use my phone.

09:45.847 --> 09:47.970
- Give it back.
- Too slow.

09:49.601 --> 09:51.311
They didn't teach you any hockey in Cali?

09:52.520 --> 09:53.979
Come on, Cali Boy!

09:57.400 --> 09:58.314
Give me my phone back.

09:58.401 --> 10:00.975
Whoa, they teach you manners
in California?

10:01.446 --> 10:02.988
All you gotta do is say please.

10:10.330 --> 10:11.372
Please?

10:11.664 --> 10:14.286
That wasn't so hard, was it?
Here, take it back.

10:16.252 --> 10:19.502
Nice phone, you might want
to get that looked at, pussy.

10:21.591 --> 10:23.667
Mortal enemy, check.

10:43.905 --> 10:45.280
Hey, man, do you fix phones?

10:52.539 --> 10:56.239
You're tryin' to lock me into a lot of dos
and don'ts right now, you beautiful angel.

10:56.626 --> 11:00.125
Let me tell you something,
in a former life, I was a wolf.

11:00.922 --> 11:03.128
Hm, cool.

11:04.426 --> 11:06.963
Mmm. Mmm.

11:07.887 --> 11:11.552
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Your chi is way off.

11:11.808 --> 11:13.136
Your chakras are not aligned.

11:13.226 --> 11:16.143
You know what I'm saying?
The feng is not shui-ing.

11:17.605 --> 11:19.931
Uh-huh. Can you fix my phone or not?

11:20.567 --> 11:22.086
Yeah, I can fix your phone. Let me see it.

11:22.110 --> 11:23.308
Okay.

11:24.279 --> 11:27.196
Yeah, say goodnight. This thing's done.

11:27.282 --> 11:29.855
You've "Insta-ed" your last gram,
tweeted your last twit.

11:29.951 --> 11:33.237
I know, you left your whole life behind,
and you're pissed.

11:33.329 --> 11:36.034
And the kids around here,
in pistachio khakis?

11:36.791 --> 11:39.792
They don't really comprendo
a surfer dude like you.

11:39.878 --> 11:42.795
Am I right? Or am I right?

11:43.965 --> 11:46.337
How did you know that?

11:46.843 --> 11:49.132
Because I'm here to lighten
the load, baby.

11:51.264 --> 11:55.262
Listen, why don't you tell me
what I can do

11:55.351 --> 11:58.934
to make your life a little more Namaste.

12:01.149 --> 12:03.936
I don't know. I just...

12:04.444 --> 12:05.724
I want things to be different.

12:14.370 --> 12:15.413
Let's fly.

12:16.706 --> 12:17.749
Do it with me.

12:18.291 --> 12:21.043
- I'm not gonna do that.
- Then nothing's gonna change.

12:21.711 --> 12:25.875
Don't be scared.
Come on. Yeah, yeah. There you go, fly.

12:25.965 --> 12:28.587
Close your eyes.
Do you know what's below you?

12:28.676 --> 12:30.904
All the haters,
and they're pointing and they're saying,

12:30.929 --> 12:34.298
"Look at that beautiful,
blond bird with well-conditioned hair."

12:34.390 --> 12:37.391
You know what I'm saying?

12:38.061 --> 12:40.730
That was intense, man. How do you feel?

12:41.106 --> 12:42.730
- Embarrassed.
- Great, me too.

12:42.941 --> 12:45.017
I want to show you something.
Take a look at this.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.147
It's my own social media app.
It's called U-NIVERSE.

12:48.238 --> 12:51.073
When you look at this screen, man,
what do you see?

12:51.825 --> 12:52.825
A blank page?

12:52.867 --> 12:56.071
You're cute, but you are so stupid.
This is you, dude.

12:56.162 --> 12:59.163
Not the "you" you are,
the "you" you want to be.

12:59.249 --> 13:00.909
You can be anybody.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.459
You just gotta fill this page,

13:02.919 --> 13:04.959
a new beginning, you know what I'm saying?

13:05.046 --> 13:09.126
Because when you put positive vibes
out in the universe, the universe listens.

13:09.884 --> 13:12.885
Give me your hand.
Give me your beautiful, soft hand.

13:13.596 --> 13:14.639
Take this

13:15.932 --> 13:16.975
and go...

13:18.184 --> 13:19.299
to your destiny.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.147
Thanks.

13:34.492 --> 13:35.535
Ah.

13:41.332 --> 13:44.701
We're all made of energy, me and you.

13:45.170 --> 13:46.296
You've gotta be kidding me.

13:47.172 --> 13:48.898
Your mom and dad...

13:48.923 --> 13:50.121
Oh, whatever.

14:01.728 --> 14:03.720
All you gotta do is fill the screen, baby.

14:09.694 --> 14:11.901
Pants up, hands where I can see 'em.

14:11.988 --> 14:14.090
- What do you want?
- I need to borrow your balcony.

14:14.115 --> 14:16.010
My window's painted shut,
and I need to sneak out.

14:16.034 --> 14:17.077
Where you goin'?

14:17.160 --> 14:19.865
Xing-fu's taking me
to an Anime and Chill party.

14:19.954 --> 14:22.790
Mmm. What are you doing tonight?
That's right, nothing.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.579
See ya.

15:11.339 --> 15:12.714
Good morning.

15:12.799 --> 15:16.168
Just warming up the pipes,
don't mind me.

15:21.641 --> 15:23.550
- Good morning, Sunshine.
- Good morning.

15:24.102 --> 15:25.845
You might want to take a look outside.

15:27.981 --> 15:28.981
Is that my car?

15:29.023 --> 15:30.482
That just showed up on a truck.

15:30.567 --> 15:33.733
Yes! I can't believe it.
That's my car!

15:33.820 --> 15:36.062
Yes, it is, and I can't believe it.

15:36.156 --> 15:37.198
There's no way.

15:38.366 --> 15:39.196
Where's Dad?

15:39.284 --> 15:41.193
Probably tanning
on a beach somewhere

15:41.286 --> 15:44.287
and look, you need to get a job,
so you can pay for the gas

15:44.372 --> 15:46.697
but I will help you with the insurance.

15:46.791 --> 15:49.496
Okay. Oh, I knew he'd come through.

15:50.295 --> 15:51.409
Yes!

15:53.214 --> 15:55.358
Yeah, I thought about trying out
for the hockey team,

15:55.383 --> 15:57.708
but my physician said that
I have the ankle strength

15:57.802 --> 15:59.344
of a ten-year-old girl.

15:59.429 --> 16:01.782
But you know, multiplayer,
online gaming is my real passion.

16:01.806 --> 16:03.033
It can get pretty physical, too.

16:03.057 --> 16:05.845
Like one time, I passed out
after 17 straight hours of Warcraft.

16:05.935 --> 16:07.513
- Really?
- Yeah, dehydration.

16:07.604 --> 16:09.561
I went to the doctors
and I woke up in the ER.

16:09.647 --> 16:12.221
And then, I met my girlfriend
through League of Legends.

16:12.317 --> 16:15.816
She's a bikini model,
her name's Guadalupe.

16:15.904 --> 16:17.447
Hey, Lonnie, can I ask you something?

16:17.489 --> 16:19.446
Have you ever heard of an app
called U-NIVERSE?

16:20.158 --> 16:23.859
No, and I'm on everything,
Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest.

16:23.953 --> 16:26.372
Sure, I only have two followers.
It's my mom and my granny,

16:26.414 --> 16:28.573
and my dad blocked me for some reason.

16:28.666 --> 16:30.686
That's weird.
Why would you block your own son, right?

16:30.710 --> 16:33.545
I haven't talked to him about that...
Wait, wait, what's U-NIVERSE?

16:39.719 --> 16:41.878
It's just something I read about.
Gotta go, see ya'.

16:43.181 --> 16:46.597
Cool, nothing.
Thanks for starting that conversation.

16:47.602 --> 16:49.927
I'll tell Guadalupe about that.

16:50.396 --> 16:52.306
She's my girlfriend. Guadalupe is my girl.

16:52.398 --> 16:54.308
No one cares? Are you on Twitter?

Beth! Beth, thank you very much.

17:09.124 --> 17:12.705
Um, I don't mean for you
to take this personally

17:13.252 --> 17:16.419
but that w as, and I say this
with the utmost respect,

17:16.506 --> 17:19.922
like listening to two cats humping,
is that fair?

17:21.344 --> 17:22.886
Thanks, Beth!

17:23.637 --> 17:25.595
Enjoy the stage as you leave, it's...

17:26.057 --> 17:27.931
it's the last time you'll ever be on one.

17:28.560 --> 17:29.602
Okay.

17:48.371 --> 17:51.076
All right, off you go,
everybody who didn't make it.

17:51.166 --> 17:52.031
You can leave.

17:52.125 --> 17:54.331
Grab your...
There, yes, you're one, certainly.

17:54.419 --> 17:55.498
Yes, you were terrible.

17:55.587 --> 17:57.994
Okay? Thanks, gang, have a good day.

17:58.089 --> 18:00.711
All right, Dani, Brian,
I'm gonna need you up on stage.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.422
Band and chorus,
we got nine weeks to do this.

18:03.511 --> 18:04.792
Not a lot of time.

18:07.599 --> 18:10.516
Excuse me, um, sorry.

18:11.770 --> 18:12.849
I'm here to audition.

18:12.937 --> 18:14.100
Okay, and you are?

18:14.439 --> 18:17.356
- I'm Kyle Moore.
- Are you a singer, Mr Moore?

18:17.734 --> 18:21.684
Yeah, uh, I'm classically trained.

18:22.155 --> 18:23.740
You're classically trained?

18:23.823 --> 18:24.823
Yep.

18:24.866 --> 18:28.365
Okay, everybody sit down,
we're gonna do one more up here.

18:29.996 --> 18:31.241
You know where the stage is?

18:32.665 --> 18:34.076
- It's this thing.
- Yeah.

18:34.626 --> 18:35.871
Have a go at it.

18:38.797 --> 18:39.876
Hoo.

18:41.382 --> 18:43.838
All right, hey,
what will you be singing?

18:44.260 --> 18:45.126
- Singing?
- Yeah.

18:45.220 --> 18:46.334
Uh...

18:47.680 --> 18:49.887
it's a surprise, even to me.

18:49.974 --> 18:55.051
I usually just let my inner rock-star
do whatever he's feeling.

18:55.146 --> 18:56.771
Your inner rock-star?

18:57.148 --> 18:58.191
Yeah.

19:00.026 --> 19:01.069
Yeah.

19:02.404 --> 19:04.562
We're all just made
of molecules, man.

19:04.656 --> 19:09.116
We're just energy.
All you have to do is soar!

19:58.710 --> 20:00.453
What the hell?

20:03.131 --> 20:05.373
Quite a surprise, Mr Moore.

20:05.842 --> 20:08.796
My God, that's the craziest thing
I've ever seen.

20:09.304 --> 20:13.254
You must be a very lonely person.

20:15.351 --> 20:18.269
Come back when your balls drop.

20:19.939 --> 20:21.315
Au revoir, mademoiselle.

20:21.399 --> 20:23.191
Seriously, come back when your balls drop.

20:34.746 --> 20:36.620
Dude, I am freaking out!

20:36.706 --> 20:40.786
You gotta tell me what the deal is
with the... Dude? Dude?

20:41.086 --> 20:43.244
Hey, dude. Dude!

20:43.338 --> 20:44.380
Huh? Oh.

20:46.174 --> 20:48.961
I remember you.
You're the angry kid with no friends.

20:49.052 --> 20:50.386
Yeah, stay with me here, listen.

20:51.012 --> 20:54.262
That U-NIVERSE app you put on my phone,
it's insane.

20:54.349 --> 20:56.756
It worked.
The things that I wished for happened.

20:58.103 --> 20:59.145
Right.

20:59.813 --> 21:02.374
Some things that I wished for didn't
happen the way that I wanted them to.

21:02.398 --> 21:04.521
- I know.
- Well?

21:04.609 --> 21:06.187
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yeah.

21:06.277 --> 21:08.566
If a unicorn wrote a tweet
and then posted it

21:08.655 --> 21:12.190
and then he put it up and deleted it
and then a tree fell down in the forest,

21:12.283 --> 21:14.774
- does anybody even hear it?
- What are you talking about?

21:14.994 --> 21:17.568
Listen, that U-NIVERSE app,
can you tell me how to control it?

21:18.039 --> 21:20.495
Can you tell me if I can take
back something that I posted?

21:20.583 --> 21:21.864
What do you want to take back?

21:30.677 --> 21:32.883
Whoa, dude!

21:33.138 --> 21:34.513
That's what you wished for?

21:35.807 --> 21:37.301
- Listen to me, man.
- What?

21:38.184 --> 21:40.722
You can't change the past,
that's crazy talk.

21:42.439 --> 21:44.764
- Is this forever?
- Me and you?

21:45.358 --> 21:47.351
No, no! I'm talking about the app.

21:47.444 --> 21:48.486
- Oh, the app.
- Y es!

21:48.570 --> 21:50.811
- All I know is this.
- Y eah.

21:50.905 --> 21:54.440
The universe is changing
thousands of times every second.

21:55.160 --> 21:56.986
You just gotta update your status.

22:00.039 --> 22:01.415
Update my status.

22:07.839 --> 22:10.330
Update my status,
the universe will assist.

22:13.803 --> 22:14.846
My man!

22:16.264 --> 22:17.379
Dad?

22:18.683 --> 22:19.726
What's up?

22:20.018 --> 22:21.216
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:22.103 --> 22:23.514
I can't believe you're here.

22:23.605 --> 22:25.514
What are you doing here?

22:25.607 --> 22:27.065
Ah, dude, I don't even know.

22:27.567 --> 22:29.586
I woke up and I was like,
"I gotta get out of here.

22:29.611 --> 22:32.315
I gotta go. I gotta go," so I just did.

22:32.405 --> 22:33.698
I don't know, I got on a plane.

22:33.740 --> 22:35.614
- Boom, I'm here.
- Wow.

22:35.700 --> 22:37.368
Hey, why aren't you driving Born to Run?

22:37.911 --> 22:40.781
- Mom says I have to get a job first.
- Heard that before.

22:40.872 --> 22:42.223
Listen, grab a sponge, all right?

22:42.248 --> 22:44.075
Can't have ladies getting in a dirty ride.

22:44.167 --> 22:45.626
You got it.

22:46.586 --> 22:48.272
So tell me something,
what's been happening?

22:48.296 --> 22:49.494
Oh, you don't even know.

22:49.589 --> 22:54.500
I've been skating and surfing every day,
12 hours a day sometimes.

22:55.136 --> 22:58.256
Hey!
Anna Banana, how are you doing?

22:59.808 --> 23:02.186
Hey, killer,
you want to give us a second?

23:03.019 --> 23:04.062
Yeah.

23:09.984 --> 23:12.273
- What are you doing here?
- You look great.

23:12.362 --> 23:14.520
I forgot what those scrubs do to you.

23:14.864 --> 23:17.071
So great.

23:19.119 --> 23:24.196
I'm telling you, these waves were
topping out like at 30 feet. 30 feet!

23:24.290 --> 23:26.501
That's like as big as this house!
I mean, that's huge!

23:26.543 --> 23:28.437
I don't think you truly appreciate
how big this is.

23:28.461 --> 23:30.588
Annie, give them the arm wave,
show them, show them.

23:30.797 --> 23:33.252
All right, this is me on my board, right?

23:33.341 --> 23:36.627
This is the 30-foot wave. Look at that!
This is to scale, Maxi.

23:37.137 --> 23:40.755
Ugh! Ugh! Shred! Shred! Bleed! Bleed!
Pull, snap through.

23:41.182 --> 23:44.219
Thanks, Ann. And they were just coming,
one after the other

23:44.310 --> 23:48.438
and I surfed them, all day long.
All day, Allen! Into the evening, even.

23:48.523 --> 23:51.144
And then I fell asleep
to the sounds of that angry ocean

23:51.234 --> 23:52.693
just pounding the beach.

23:57.574 --> 24:00.658
It was pretty great.

24:00.869 --> 24:04.783
Wake up the next day
and we did it all again. What?

24:04.998 --> 24:07.184
It was one of the best times
I've ever had in my entire life.

24:07.208 --> 24:10.957
Except for the time...
you and I rebuilt the Alpha Romeo.

24:11.045 --> 24:12.773
That was the best time I ever
had in my life.

24:12.797 --> 24:15.759
- Hey, agreed! Born to Run! Whoo!
- Born to Run! Cheers to that, my man.

24:15.884 --> 24:19.087
Well, it's good to have you back, Dad.
Now Kyle has a shoulder to cry on.

24:19.596 --> 24:21.339
Maxi, chill out.

24:21.431 --> 24:24.183
So, Darryl, what do you plan
on doing for work here?

24:24.267 --> 24:26.343
Well, I connected with
an old skate buddy of mine

24:26.436 --> 24:28.313
who's got his own brand
out here in New Haven.

24:28.354 --> 24:30.315
He's gonna hook me up
with a job doing graphics.

24:30.732 --> 24:31.894
It's a real job.

24:31.983 --> 24:33.643
So I hit the ground running tomorrow.

24:33.860 --> 24:39.151
But tonight, I just want to say
that I am so happy to be here

24:39.240 --> 24:43.902
hanging out with that sexy,
little surfer chick I met 22 years ago.

24:44.120 --> 24:46.694
Do you remember that girl, Anna Banana,
I think her name was?

24:46.790 --> 24:48.663
- Sort of.
- Anna Banana.

24:49.167 --> 24:53.081
Annie, Kyle, Maxi, I love you guys.

24:53.922 --> 24:56.210
There's no other place
in the universe I'd rather be.

24:58.343 --> 25:00.585
Cheers.

25:01.679 --> 25:02.722
Cheers, Allen.

25:07.268 --> 25:08.431
So what did I do?

25:11.523 --> 25:12.685
What would you do?

25:13.066 --> 25:14.109
All right, U-NIVERSE,

25:16.444 --> 25:17.820
let's make some moves.

25:33.628 --> 25:34.671
Thank you, Doris.

25:36.047 --> 25:37.328
- I want another shot.
- Huh?

25:37.424 --> 25:38.669
I want another shot.

25:38.758 --> 25:40.881
Uh, you want a Castrato role now?

25:40.969 --> 25:43.155
I don't think you're gonna like
the requirements very much.

25:43.179 --> 25:48.221
You suck!

25:49.519 --> 25:51.580
See? That's how it's actually done...

25:51.604 --> 25:53.597
because I'm actually classically trained.

25:53.690 --> 25:55.398
All right? Now get out of here.

26:02.449 --> 26:03.777
Hey, can I borrow that?

29:18.853 --> 29:21.558
I had no idea what to expect
after yesterday.

29:21.648 --> 29:23.724
But oh, my God, you frigging killed it.

29:23.817 --> 29:26.189
I'm so happy. I hated singing with Brian.

29:26.277 --> 29:28.235
The best part was watching Massey freak

29:28.321 --> 29:30.610
and then Mr Moody
kick him out of chorus. So good!

29:30.698 --> 29:33.071
Since when did my brother
get so many friends?

29:33.159 --> 29:35.781
And who has the non-dairy,
chocolate, caramel latte?

29:35.870 --> 29:38.361
That would be me,
the lactose intolerant one.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.767
Can't drink milk,
because it goes through me

29:40.792 --> 29:43.746
like lava through a Philippine village,
just...

29:43.837 --> 29:46.209
Just really thick.
Would you like to go out sometime?

29:47.966 --> 29:49.008
No, thanks.

29:49.551 --> 29:51.009
Is it because of the diarrhoea?

29:56.182 --> 29:57.225
Brian's here.

30:00.854 --> 30:03.689
Let's go, outside, you and me, right now.

30:03.773 --> 30:04.852
Brian, just go away.

30:04.941 --> 30:07.977
You no longer have the privilege
of speaking to me.

30:08.445 --> 30:10.236
And when I'm selling out the Garden,

30:10.321 --> 30:13.525
you'll all be kissing my waxed,
platinum butt cheeks.

30:13.616 --> 30:16.190
- Brian!
- Zip it, Gigi Had-da-da!

30:16.911 --> 30:18.931
- All right, that's it!
- Kyle, don't, this is stupid.

30:18.955 --> 30:19.998
No, it's okay.

30:21.750 --> 30:22.792
Let's go.

30:33.344 --> 30:36.132
Brian! Brian, don't do this.

30:36.639 --> 30:37.682
Kyle!

30:40.143 --> 30:41.388
Guys, come on.

30:43.855 --> 30:48.066
One rule, no touching my face.
This is my money maker.

31:00.747 --> 31:01.790
Whoa.

31:02.499 --> 31:03.827
I am so gonna cream you.

31:25.605 --> 31:27.398
Be like water
making its way through cracks.

31:27.440 --> 31:28.685
- You're dead!
- Kyle!

31:36.699 --> 31:37.814
Ooh!

31:44.249 --> 31:46.325
Point taken. I'm good.

31:48.670 --> 31:50.088
- Here you go, Gramps.
- Thank you.

31:51.631 --> 31:54.122
Hey, Anime, I don't know
what's going on with this look,

31:54.217 --> 31:56.375
but I am digging it, big time.

31:56.469 --> 31:58.378
Our daughter is wearing a dog collar.

31:58.471 --> 32:01.472
Darryl, um, how was your first day?

32:02.100 --> 32:05.848
It went well.
Yeah, it's just a wait-and-see game now.

32:06.438 --> 32:09.190
What do you mean, wait and see?
I thought you said you had the job.

32:09.482 --> 32:11.807
I do, I do.
I just had to meet my boy's partner.

32:11.901 --> 32:14.060
Big dog and pony show, you know how it is.

32:14.154 --> 32:17.487
Don't worry, I got the job, okay?
Hey, killer, what gives?

32:17.574 --> 32:20.034
We were supposed to meet at
the skate park. You stood me up.

32:20.952 --> 32:22.660
Sorry about that, I got caught up.

32:23.329 --> 32:25.618
- He got into a fight.
- You got in a fight?

32:25.707 --> 32:28.624
- Yeah, oh, yes.
- Maxi.

32:28.710 --> 32:30.646
You dropped him like a bad habit, too,
didn't you?

32:30.670 --> 32:33.505
- It wasn't a big deal, Mom.
- Um, it is a big deal.

32:33.590 --> 32:35.425
What is wrong with you?
Why are you fighting?

32:35.467 --> 32:36.629
Relax, okay?

32:36.718 --> 32:38.821
There's nothing wrong with him.
There's not a scratch on him.

32:38.845 --> 32:40.921
He's looking good, he's walking tall.

32:41.014 --> 32:43.505
I taught my son not to act like that.

32:43.850 --> 32:46.341
Well, apparently he does, and he wins.

32:46.895 --> 32:48.686
Give me some.

32:49.856 --> 32:52.347
Mom, I'm fine, and it won't happen again.

32:53.735 --> 32:55.478
- Can I be excused?
- Where you going?

32:56.321 --> 32:57.234
Meeting up with a friend.

32:57.322 --> 32:59.282
Friends, singing in the chorus, fighting,

32:59.324 --> 33:00.866
you're not that cool, dude.

33:00.950 --> 33:03.109
Get out of here, have fun,
enjoy your date.

33:03.203 --> 33:04.780
Thanks. Thank you, Dad.

33:04.871 --> 33:07.327
And try not to get in any fights.
See what I did.

33:07.415 --> 33:10.500
Hey, hold on a second.
Why don't you take the Alfa.

33:11.002 --> 33:12.829
You're the best, Dad!

33:13.588 --> 33:14.916
I am the best.

33:16.132 --> 33:17.175
What?

33:25.391 --> 33:27.016
Okay, where are we going?

33:27.102 --> 33:31.230
If you could do anything in the world,
right now,

33:32.107 --> 33:33.149
what would it be?

33:34.192 --> 33:35.437
I would...

33:36.945 --> 33:38.059
ride a Ferris wheel.

33:38.405 --> 33:39.815
- Really?
- Yeah, mmm-hmm.

33:41.658 --> 33:43.650
- Why?
- I love Ferris wheels.

33:44.077 --> 33:46.034
I've loved them ever since
I was a little girl.

33:48.540 --> 33:49.582
Well, you're in luck.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.495
I just happen to know where one is.

34:02.262 --> 34:03.424
Oh, oh, no.

34:07.517 --> 34:08.797
- Oh, my God!
- You like it?

34:09.226 --> 34:11.184
Oh, my God, this is so good.

34:12.105 --> 34:13.516
Where did it even come from?

34:13.940 --> 34:16.811
One night only... and it's all for us.

34:18.862 --> 34:20.570
Come on.

34:21.739 --> 34:22.902
This is too good.

34:23.824 --> 34:24.940
Hello.

34:25.368 --> 34:26.946
Well, hi.

34:27.036 --> 34:28.744
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

34:28.830 --> 34:29.909
Thanks.

34:31.583 --> 34:32.828
Whoo!

34:35.670 --> 34:37.414
This feels right.

34:40.592 --> 34:43.165
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

34:44.137 --> 34:46.509
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

34:48.391 --> 34:50.264
- Yeah!
- This is so cool.

34:50.351 --> 34:51.393
Yeah, it is.

34:52.103 --> 34:53.217
Everything you wanted?

34:53.313 --> 34:56.646
Oh, this is like the dream.
I'm obsessed with this.

34:57.275 --> 34:59.896
Oh, yeah.

34:59.986 --> 35:02.062
Hey, how do you like singing
with our chorus?

35:02.697 --> 35:03.812
- I like it.
- Yeah?

35:03.907 --> 35:06.742
I just wish we were singing
something more now.

35:07.118 --> 35:09.194
- Yes.
- Or at least 2003.

35:09.287 --> 35:11.659
Mmm-hmm. Mr Moody plays it so safe.

35:11.748 --> 35:14.417
It's probably why Hayden
has never won the Slam.

35:14.501 --> 35:15.543
Hm.

35:16.169 --> 35:18.790
Man, it would feel so good
just to win one time.

35:22.717 --> 35:24.295
We're gonna win the Slam this year.

35:25.678 --> 35:26.721
I promise.

35:36.940 --> 35:38.434
This is the perfect fall night.

35:41.486 --> 35:43.479
- I've never seen fall before.
- No.

35:43.571 --> 35:44.734
I'm from Huntington Beach.

35:44.823 --> 35:48.772
Well, you are in for a treat
because nothing beats New England falls.

35:50.870 --> 35:52.827
Have you ever heard
of the Heavenly Pursuit?

35:53.081 --> 35:55.157
- What's that?
- Okay, well,

35:55.834 --> 35:57.992
autumn is the time of year that the moon

35:58.086 --> 36:01.669
after pursuing the sun since spring,
finally catches up to her,

36:02.590 --> 36:06.422
but then he out distances her
and the whole pursuit begins again.

36:07.303 --> 36:09.877
It's kind of like two lovers
who lose one another.

36:10.306 --> 36:12.928
But his love is so powerful

36:13.017 --> 36:16.469
that he spends his entire life
trying to find her.

36:17.856 --> 36:19.101
That sounds kinda tragic.

36:19.190 --> 36:20.305
Yeah.

36:21.192 --> 36:24.229
I know, I'm a total sucker
for a tragic love story.

36:26.114 --> 36:27.905
But I think every girl wants a moon.

36:29.659 --> 36:31.533
Yeah.

36:40.003 --> 36:41.711
This has been the coolest night.

36:44.841 --> 36:45.884
Yeah.

36:52.599 --> 36:55.660
I don't get it. I've lived here my whole
life and no one even knows who I am.

36:55.685 --> 36:57.512
Come on, that's not true.

36:57.604 --> 36:59.014
- Hi, Liza.
- Who are you?

36:59.105 --> 37:01.624
Lonnie Gregory, your next door neighbour
for the past 17 years.

37:01.649 --> 37:03.309
Doesn't ring a bell. Sorry.

37:03.401 --> 37:06.071
Of course not. Hey, thanks for not
inviting me to your sweet 16.

37:06.154 --> 37:08.645
It was beautiful from what I saw
from the window anyways.

37:08.740 --> 37:10.282
But that's what I mean, you.

37:10.366 --> 37:11.695
You show up four weeks ago

37:11.785 --> 37:15.236
and now your life is like this
amazing fairy tale, right?

37:15.330 --> 37:16.575
I keep thinking about it.

37:16.664 --> 37:19.120
And it's a little annoying, actually,
but in a good way.

37:20.794 --> 37:22.545
Okay, Lonnie,
I have to tell you something.

37:22.962 --> 37:25.833
But you gotta promise me that
you won't tell anyone. Promise?

37:26.257 --> 37:28.499
- Yeah, not even Mom.
- You sure? You talk a lot.

37:28.593 --> 37:30.612
- I know I talk a lot. Just tell me.
- Okay, okay.

37:30.637 --> 37:35.548
I have a magic app on my phone
and whatever I post on it, comes true.

37:37.393 --> 37:40.513
- I'm sorry, what? What?
- It's insane.

37:40.605 --> 37:42.598
Oh, my God! I have the same app.

37:42.690 --> 37:44.126
- I thought I was the only one.
- Really?

37:44.150 --> 37:45.265
Yeah, no, dude!

37:45.360 --> 37:47.421
- Come on, you lost your mind.
- Lonnie, I'm telling the truth.

37:47.445 --> 37:49.197
Okay, fine.
If that was even a possibility,

37:49.280 --> 37:51.384
which I'm not saying that it is,
how would that even work?

37:51.408 --> 37:52.487
I'll tell you.

37:52.575 --> 37:55.695
Okay, so my phone broke, so I took it to
the mall to this bearded dude.

37:55.787 --> 37:57.038
- Bearded dude?
- Bearded dude.

37:57.080 --> 37:59.701
He gave me a new phone with this app
called U-NIVERSE on it.

37:59.791 --> 38:01.499
The universe is always eavesdropping.

38:01.793 --> 38:04.663
There's this unicorn and if the unicorn
posts a tweet in the woods

38:04.754 --> 38:06.913
and then deletes the tweet,
does it make a sound?

38:07.757 --> 38:11.672
Oh, man, you Californians, okay.

38:12.345 --> 38:14.551
I'm not crazy. I'm telling you the truth.

38:14.639 --> 38:15.552
It does sound crazy,

38:15.640 --> 38:18.511
- because it's bullshit, all right?
- Lonnie!

38:18.601 --> 38:21.057
Look, if anyone understands
the need for fantasy, it's me.

38:21.146 --> 38:23.665
I mean, I spend more of my time
on Azeroth than I do on earth.

38:23.690 --> 38:27.438
But I don't try to convince people
that I'm Archmage Khadgar the Wizard.

38:27.527 --> 38:29.852
Maybe you guys do things
differently in California.

38:29.946 --> 38:32.864
Maybe it's the avocados,
maybe it's the stuff everyone's smoking,

38:32.949 --> 38:34.112
you know what I'm saying?

38:34.200 --> 38:36.429
But we don't do things like that,
no one... What is that?

38:36.453 --> 38:39.026
This is a gift.
This is my favourite skateboard.

38:39.122 --> 38:41.328
- Cool.
- And I want to give it to you.

38:41.416 --> 38:43.076
- What?
- I want you to have it.

38:43.668 --> 38:46.076
- It's for you, come on.
- That's so awesome.

38:47.964 --> 38:51.713
That's the nose, that's the tail,
and those two bolts are what you stand on.

38:51.801 --> 38:54.802
Oh, I don't know, my ankles, remember?
It's the height.

38:54.888 --> 38:56.907
- I'm afraid of heights.
- Lonnie, get on the board.

38:56.931 --> 38:58.390
Okay, here I go, um...

39:00.226 --> 39:02.100
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

39:02.187 --> 39:04.226
You smell like avocados.
You smell so good.

39:04.314 --> 39:06.805
What do you put in your hair?
It's my hair's just...

39:07.692 --> 39:08.794
- You're good.
- It's high up here.

39:08.818 --> 39:10.421
- Does anybody get a nose bleed?
- You'll be fine.

39:10.445 --> 39:12.022
- How high up are we?
- An inch.

39:12.113 --> 39:14.355
That's a lot. Just... What do I do now?

39:14.449 --> 39:16.774
You kick back and enjoy the ride.

39:16.868 --> 39:18.763
Oh, my God, I'm getting light hands,
because it's so high.

39:18.787 --> 39:21.906
Whoa! What's going on? I'm not
doing anything. Why is it taking off?

39:22.457 --> 39:24.995
Whoa, I'm actually skateboard...
Get out of the way!

39:25.085 --> 39:26.460
- Whoo!
- Look at me!

39:26.544 --> 39:29.379
Whoa, whoa!

39:38.014 --> 39:39.674
Did you see that?

39:39.766 --> 39:42.553
Look at you rip, doggie! Whoo!

39:42.811 --> 39:44.602
Yeah!

39:44.687 --> 39:45.850
Dude, is that Grimace?

39:46.731 --> 39:49.768
It's me, Lonnie,
you don't know my name, that's okay.

39:58.326 --> 39:59.785
Yeah!

40:02.163 --> 40:03.206
Watch this.

40:03.998 --> 40:07.367
This is the coolest thing
I've ever done! Like, by far!

40:08.336 --> 40:10.957
It's the best day of my life!

40:12.632 --> 40:15.586
Lonnie! Lonnie!

40:15.677 --> 40:18.250
Lonnie! You all right, man?
How many fingers?

40:18.346 --> 40:19.509
You have fingers.

40:19.597 --> 40:20.657
Come on, let's get you up.

40:20.682 --> 40:23.433
You gotta watch what you're eating...
I mean, going.

40:24.185 --> 40:25.977
What are you doing? You could've hurt him.

40:26.062 --> 40:28.304
Well, it's not my fault
he's fat and uncoordinated.

40:29.065 --> 40:30.180
Yeah?

40:32.444 --> 40:35.528
Well, if it's so easy...
why don't you try it?

40:36.740 --> 40:38.616
Or are you just some pussy
in a letter jacket?

40:46.040 --> 40:48.117
Look at me, I'm riding a skateboard.

40:48.209 --> 40:49.520
- What are you doing?
- Who's the pussy now?

40:49.544 --> 40:51.122
- Watch this.
- It's so easy.

40:52.130 --> 40:55.000
Whoa, what? Whoa, slow down.

40:55.091 --> 40:57.214
Yo, what is going on? Yo, guys, stop this.

40:57.469 --> 41:00.920
Yo, Oliver! Dude, hey, dude!

41:01.222 --> 41:03.381
Stop, stop! Move back away!

41:16.571 --> 41:18.490
Aren't you going to study
for the Spanish test?

41:18.740 --> 41:19.854
I'm just gonna wing it.

41:19.949 --> 41:22.191
Okay, wow, you know,
you are the only person I know

41:22.285 --> 41:23.993
that never studies and gets all As.

41:26.372 --> 41:28.579
- You write music?
- Oh, it's nothing.

41:29.751 --> 41:32.123
- Sing something for me.
- No.

41:33.171 --> 41:35.294
Okay, shut your face, it's not happening.

41:35.799 --> 41:39.084
Dani, I don't know! I've never heard
of the game Truth or Dare before!

41:39.177 --> 41:40.571
What are you doing? My mom will hear you.

41:40.595 --> 41:42.837
- Dani, what are you doing?
- Kyle, stop it!

41:42.931 --> 41:45.600
- Dani, what's going on up there?
- Nothing, Mom! Nothing!

41:46.392 --> 41:49.892
Stop it. You're a freak.

41:49.979 --> 41:51.022
Get over there.

41:54.359 --> 41:56.850
If you so much as roll your eyes,
I swear I'll murder you.

41:57.779 --> 41:59.985
All right, cross my heart and hope to die.

42:03.535 --> 42:04.365
"Drowning?"

42:04.452 --> 42:06.908
Mmm-hmm, yes, I know,
it sounds a little morbid,

42:06.996 --> 42:10.365
but it's really just a conversation
between two people falling in love.

42:10.708 --> 42:13.294
Yeah, leave it to me to write a song
that sounds like a eulogy.

42:13.878 --> 42:16.334
Whoa, wait, wait, wait,
you gotta sing it for me.

42:16.423 --> 42:18.484
- No, Kyle, no, you know I'm not...
- Just a few verses, please?

42:18.508 --> 42:21.046
Just a few verses,
that's all I'm asking for.

42:21.428 --> 42:22.542

44:33.643 --> 44:36.264
Mr Moody, Dani and I have been
working on something

44:36.354 --> 44:38.541
- that we'd love to show you.
- Kyle, what are you doing?

44:38.565 --> 44:41.627
Kyle, I've been doing this a long time.
I think I know what song is going to work.

44:41.651 --> 44:44.059
I know, but Dani wrote this song
and it's tight, Mr Moody.

44:44.320 --> 44:45.400
Just hear it out.

44:45.488 --> 44:46.982
I'm sure it's very "tight".

44:47.073 --> 44:49.991
It's just that this song
has a significance for me.

44:50.577 --> 44:52.285
- Why?
- Because I sang it once.

44:52.370 --> 44:53.533
- What for?
- Mr Pookins.

44:53.621 --> 44:54.701
Who's Mr Pookins?

44:54.789 --> 44:56.746
- My cat.
- You sang a song for your cat?

44:56.833 --> 45:00.166
My dead cat. He died!
I sang it at his funeral.

45:02.213 --> 45:03.256
Sorry.

45:03.506 --> 45:04.621
It was a suicide.

45:07.051 --> 45:10.171
Can we just play the song for you once,
please? You won't regret it.

45:11.014 --> 45:12.591
- Do the short version.

46:00.939 --> 46:03.311
Our song? It's your song, I just helped.

46:03.399 --> 46:07.100
Tonight, Hawks hockey
season opener, be there, 7:00pm.

46:07.195 --> 46:09.069
What is with the hockey insanity?

46:09.155 --> 46:10.899
First game of the year is tonight.

46:11.157 --> 46:13.565
What's even worse is
the biggest game of the season

46:13.660 --> 46:14.940
is the same night as the Slam.

46:15.036 --> 46:17.361
I'll be so surprised
if anybody even shows up.

46:17.455 --> 46:19.329
Hey, you all should go to the Slam!

46:19.416 --> 46:22.395
I'm telling you, if not, you'll miss out
and you'll have to watch it on YouTube.

46:22.419 --> 46:23.996
- Yeah, go!
- I'm telling you.

46:25.505 --> 46:28.422
You know, nobody but you
could've got me to share my music.

46:29.426 --> 46:32.213
Thank you. I'm happy I met you.

46:32.846 --> 46:36.012
- I'm kind of happy I met you.
- You're so dumb.

46:41.646 --> 46:43.224
I gotta go to class, bye.

46:45.734 --> 46:47.810
- Bye!
- Later, gator.

46:49.070 --> 46:51.146
- Jesus.
- Isn't that sweet?

46:51.239 --> 46:53.658
The lady and the tramp
were about to have their first kiss.

46:53.908 --> 46:54.988
What's with you, Massey?

46:55.243 --> 46:56.868
I Google Chrome-d you

46:56.953 --> 46:59.180
and there's not a single mention of you
singing anywhere

46:59.205 --> 47:00.450
before you came to Hayden.

47:01.040 --> 47:04.207
Something about you stinks,
and I'm gonna figure it out.

47:04.586 --> 47:07.456
And then I'm gonna stuff and mount you.

47:13.219 --> 47:14.697
All I'm saying is be careful.

47:14.721 --> 47:16.963
Things are rarely what they appear to be.

47:17.348 --> 47:20.764
Take my girlfriend from Honduras,
the bikini model, Guadalupe?

47:20.852 --> 47:24.268
She turned out to be Phil from Cleveland.

47:24.856 --> 47:28.557
Yeah, I got catfished,
without the TV show.

47:28.651 --> 47:29.651
What are you getting at?

47:29.694 --> 47:32.046
I'm saying we don't know anything
about this bearded dude.

47:32.072 --> 47:35.322
What if he turns out to be some kind of
like, you know, master of dark arts.

47:35.408 --> 47:38.326
Look, anything that got
my family back together, can't be bad.

47:38.411 --> 47:42.788
Yeah, speaking of family, um,
it's my birthday Saturday

47:42.874 --> 47:45.875
and every year, we go to my
favourite place. It's a Greek restaurant.

47:45.960 --> 47:47.455
There's hummus and a belly dancer.

47:47.545 --> 47:48.814
- Hm.
- Yeah, I took some lessons.

47:48.838 --> 47:50.747
She asked me to leave, but I'm wondering

47:50.840 --> 47:52.818
if you wanted to go, you could go,
it's gonna be lame.

47:52.842 --> 47:54.527
- You probably... No, forget it.
- Lonnie,

47:54.552 --> 47:56.426
of course, I'm coming to your birthday.

47:56.930 --> 47:58.305
- I wouldn't miss it.
- Cool.

47:58.389 --> 48:00.309
All right, I'll text you
all the deets and stuff.

48:05.897 --> 48:09.764
- That guy is such a douche.
- Yeah, but he's Emperor Douche.

48:09.859 --> 48:11.045
And you just joined the chorus,

48:11.069 --> 48:13.358
so you're at the bottom of the barrel,
too, you know?

48:13.446 --> 48:14.465
Jealous, Chorus Boy?

48:14.489 --> 48:15.652
- No.
- Hey!

48:15.740 --> 48:18.112
Oh, getting a little angry?

48:18.201 --> 48:20.407
No one cares about Kyle Moore.

48:20.495 --> 48:23.828
I own this school and there's not
a damn thing you can do about it.

48:23.915 --> 48:25.540
Down boy.

48:29.838 --> 48:33.207
Jokes on him, this is how I eat
my mashed potatoes, so...

48:33.800 --> 48:35.468
Somebody has to bring that guy in check.

48:35.552 --> 48:37.094
Yeah, somebody's gotta check him.

48:37.178 --> 48:40.032
It would be kind of cool if you went
after the hockey team, though, right?

48:40.056 --> 48:41.883
Beat him at his own game?

48:41.975 --> 48:43.517
Our own little miracle on ice.

48:43.726 --> 48:46.134
That would be so rad, dude. So rad!

48:46.396 --> 48:48.803
Yeah, it would.

48:50.483 --> 48:52.523
Let's go! Let's go!

48:59.951 --> 49:02.109
Come on! What are you, girls? Let's go!

49:03.121 --> 49:05.956
Come on, get up, you push!
That's the best you got?

49:06.040 --> 49:08.496
You skate like my sister. Bring it in!

49:08.585 --> 49:10.328
Two-on-two back check drill.

49:10.420 --> 49:14.287
If we're gonna beat the Bulldogs,
we gotta get this right.

49:14.632 --> 49:15.795
Look who it is.

49:16.509 --> 49:17.672
- Set it up!
- Whoa.

49:24.517 --> 49:27.933
Can l...
Can I help you with something?

49:28.313 --> 49:29.427
I want a try-out, Coach.

49:31.232 --> 49:32.976
Try-outs are over, all right?

49:33.068 --> 49:35.226
That's too bad. I'm way better than Derek.

49:36.112 --> 49:38.603
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's a pretty big claim, son.

49:39.282 --> 49:40.990
Let's hope you can back that up.

49:42.118 --> 49:44.526
The ice is yours.

49:45.038 --> 49:46.781
Can't wait to see this.

49:58.343 --> 50:01.794
No, U-NIVERSE, we're here
to play hockey. No, no, no, no!

50:04.140 --> 50:05.718
Not again!

50:10.438 --> 50:11.683
What are you doing?

50:13.650 --> 50:14.692
Whoa!

50:16.528 --> 50:18.022
Whoa!

50:24.911 --> 50:27.153
You can't even do that.

50:29.249 --> 50:30.291
I can't look away.

50:31.960 --> 50:33.158
That is so beautiful.

50:40.135 --> 50:42.460
- Holy smokes!
- Oh!

50:50.728 --> 50:52.139
Not what I meant.

50:52.397 --> 50:54.970
Well, kid, you're no Wayne Gretzy,
but guess what

50:55.066 --> 50:58.649
you made the team.
Boys, meet your new equipment manager.

50:58.737 --> 51:02.319
All right! Play time's over.
Let's go! Set them up.

51:02.615 --> 51:03.944
Nice one, Cali.

51:08.997 --> 51:11.036
Wayne Gretzky. Why didn't I think of that?

51:13.585 --> 51:14.878
Let's try this again, shall we?

51:20.091 --> 51:21.170
Hey, bitches!

51:22.385 --> 51:23.428
Where you going?

51:24.679 --> 51:25.794
I'm not done yet.

51:26.848 --> 51:30.015
Okay, Frozen...

51:30.560 --> 51:31.978
Let's see you score on the goalie.

51:33.062 --> 51:34.225
Wreck him.

51:34.314 --> 51:35.689
Get the ice packs ready.

51:46.659 --> 51:47.702
Get him!

51:54.667 --> 51:55.782
Come on!

52:28.410 --> 52:29.785
First line, get out there!

52:30.829 --> 52:32.323
Not you, Lowe, stay put.

52:32.789 --> 52:34.782
- How you feeling, baby?
- I could go all night.

52:34.874 --> 52:37.448
Well, then get out there
and take the face-off!

52:37.544 --> 52:41.043
Jeez! Come on! Come on! All right, whoo!

52:46.010 --> 52:47.920
How good is he? Okay, Kyle!

52:48.388 --> 52:50.223
What are you doing?
Why aren't you out there?

52:50.557 --> 52:52.383
Let's go. Come on, boys!

53:47.655 --> 53:49.280
Kyle, you're so cool!

53:55.121 --> 53:56.402
- Hey.
- What up?

53:57.040 --> 53:58.083
What are you wearing?

53:58.833 --> 54:00.078
It's pretty sweet, right?

54:00.502 --> 54:03.456
You'll never guess, I just saw
a bunch of kids rocking my jersey!

54:03.546 --> 54:05.190
- Wow.
- I can't believe it, it's insane.

54:05.215 --> 54:07.373
You know, you missed rehearsal
this morning.

54:09.636 --> 54:10.916
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

54:11.012 --> 54:13.218
I couldn't sleep last night
after the game.

54:13.556 --> 54:14.641
But it won't happen again.

54:14.974 --> 54:18.343
I'm a little worried you're not gonna have
enough time for rehearsal now.

54:18.436 --> 54:20.643
You know that the Slam
is the same night as the game.

54:21.106 --> 54:24.521
Dani, Chorus is way more important
to me than hockey.

54:24.859 --> 54:26.057
I'll make it work.

54:30.573 --> 54:33.823
Dude! I got 2,000 likes
on my last Instagram post.

54:34.160 --> 54:36.995
What? Every time I post something,
I lose followers.

54:37.455 --> 54:40.540
Hey, so, my parents, they are
super stoked to meet you Saturday.

54:40.625 --> 54:42.144
Yeah, I'm psyched to meet them, too, man.

54:42.168 --> 54:44.873
Yeah, this is funny,
they actually don't think you exist.

54:44.963 --> 54:47.002
My dad sat me down the other day
and he was like,

54:47.090 --> 54:49.717
- "Is this 'Kyle' another 'Gary Wiggins'?"
- Who's Gary Wiggins?

54:49.843 --> 54:51.800
He was my imaginary friend
when I was a kid.

54:52.220 --> 54:54.698
Not anymore, because he moved away.
He didn't leave a forwarding address.

54:54.722 --> 54:56.826
Anyway, my parents are super excited
that you're coming,

54:56.850 --> 54:58.768
so I'm stoked for them to see
that you're real.

54:58.852 --> 55:01.177
Moore!

55:02.814 --> 55:04.771
What's up? Good, man, how are you?

55:04.858 --> 55:07.775
Moore, come sit with us, my man.
We're celebrating tonight's win.

55:08.903 --> 55:11.048
That's all right.
I'll catch up with you guys tomorrow.

55:11.072 --> 55:12.072
No, no, go with them.

55:12.115 --> 55:15.698
No, I gotta go home anyways
and do some gaming. I'm a gamer, so...

55:15.785 --> 55:17.825
- You sure?
- Yeah, no, celebrate.

55:18.037 --> 55:19.366
- Cool. Okay.
- Yeah, go.

55:19.456 --> 55:20.570
- Come on.
- Yeah.

55:20.874 --> 55:22.416
- There he is.
- Yeah!

55:24.210 --> 55:26.250
So, where's Derek?

55:26.546 --> 55:29.024
Probably picking the splinters
out of his ass from sitting all game.

55:29.048 --> 55:30.592
The Zamboni saw more ice than he did.

55:31.176 --> 55:32.089
Can I get you anything?

55:32.177 --> 55:34.846
Yes, I'll have a cheeseburger,
fries and a shake.

55:34.929 --> 55:37.467
Oh, my God, Cassie, what are you
gonna name your food baby?

55:39.517 --> 55:43.764
J-K, obviously, I'll just take
a stick of celery, please.

55:45.231 --> 55:47.141
- Hi.
- Hi?

55:47.233 --> 55:49.025
- I'm Charlotte.
- Yeah, I know.

55:49.110 --> 55:52.859
Cool. So how's it feel to be the guy
that everyone's talking about?

55:53.198 --> 55:54.365
I don't know if that's true.

55:57.035 --> 55:58.995
I bought a new perfume.
Do you want to smell me?

56:00.497 --> 56:01.539
Uh...

56:04.042 --> 56:06.615
Yeah. I do. I mean, sure.

56:15.970 --> 56:17.133
Do you like it?

56:17.388 --> 56:18.431
I love it.

56:19.390 --> 56:20.885
I'm not wearing any perfume.

56:23.353 --> 56:25.642
- Cassie's having a party this Saturday.
- I am?

56:27.148 --> 56:30.897
Right, that party, of course, I am.

56:31.236 --> 56:32.278
Do you have plans?

56:32.987 --> 56:34.779
Saturday, no, I don't think so, no.

56:35.532 --> 56:37.441
Well, now you do.

57:16.030 --> 57:17.383
- What's up, man?
- Where you been, bro?

57:17.407 --> 57:19.649
Everyone's out back.
Come on, let's go, let's go.

57:23.371 --> 57:27.036
My man! Hey, you look thirsty.

57:27.125 --> 57:28.168
- Let's go.
- Thanks.

57:28.585 --> 57:30.479
No one told me it was a costume party.

57:30.503 --> 57:31.701
Don't worry about it, bro.

57:31.796 --> 57:35.379
Boys! The man of the hour has arrived!

57:38.094 --> 57:42.341
To hockey!
One-timers, slap shots and kick saves!

57:42.432 --> 57:45.682
Bone crushing hits
that send opponents to their graves.

57:45.769 --> 57:48.390
Hat tricks, power plays and crosschecks.

57:48.480 --> 57:51.434
Hayden Hawks hockey, it's better than sex!

57:53.234 --> 57:54.277
Drink up, boys.

57:59.157 --> 58:02.775
It's the golden boy, the king of the ice.

58:02.869 --> 58:05.656
Just remember, ice breaks,

58:05.747 --> 58:08.748
and when it does,
all these people are gonna do

58:08.833 --> 58:11.205
is hold your little,
blond hair under the water.

58:14.839 --> 58:16.215
Ew!

58:18.301 --> 58:21.302
Don't worry about that.
He's sore 'cause Charlotte cut him loose.

58:21.387 --> 58:22.846
Charlotte broke up with him?

58:22.931 --> 58:26.596
OMG! Are you gonna pay
any attention to me tonight or what?

58:26.684 --> 58:28.677
Hey, Cassie, sick party.

58:28.770 --> 58:33.646
Do you like my costume?
I'm a very naughty brave.

58:35.026 --> 58:36.069
Of course, I like it.

58:37.112 --> 58:38.606
I wore it last year.

58:38.905 --> 58:39.984
I don't remember th...

58:41.825 --> 58:42.867
Want to go for a walk?

58:45.328 --> 58:46.371
Yeah.

58:50.750 --> 58:54.368
- Damn, he just made Derek disappear.
- I know.

59:04.013 --> 59:05.056
What?

59:05.265 --> 59:06.640
We thought you were over this.

59:07.350 --> 59:09.177
Kyle is real, Mom. Okay?

59:09.519 --> 59:11.013
He's not another Gary Wiggins.

59:13.106 --> 59:14.481
Of course, he's not.

59:19.487 --> 59:22.821
- So, you break up with Derek?
- I think we just grew apart.

59:23.116 --> 59:24.159
I'm extremely driven,

59:24.242 --> 59:27.278
and I want the best of everything
life has to offer, and Derek,

59:27.370 --> 59:29.577
well, he seems to be skating backwards.

59:29.664 --> 59:31.624
I have over five million
social media followers.

59:31.666 --> 59:34.287
I take more AP classes than anyone else.

59:34.377 --> 59:36.370
And I'm a state champion tennis player.

59:36.463 --> 59:39.962
I don't even like tennis, it's boring.
What about you?

59:40.049 --> 59:42.256
Do you want the best of
everything life has to offer?

59:43.011 --> 59:45.087
Yeah, yeah, I guess, I do.

59:45.680 --> 59:47.554
Well, you're on your way.

59:48.016 --> 59:53.721
You have the looks,
the grades, the popularity.

59:54.189 --> 59:56.347
You're just missing one detail.

59:57.984 --> 59:59.027
What's that?

01:00:01.488 --> 01:00:02.530
Me.

01:00:03.114 --> 01:00:05.901
Without me, you'll be idolized.

01:00:06.201 --> 01:00:07.992
But with me, you'll be deified.

01:00:09.496 --> 01:00:10.610
So, do you want me, Kyle?

01:00:11.664 --> 01:00:12.827
Because I want you.

01:00:13.249 --> 01:00:14.625
Sorry.

01:00:17.003 --> 01:00:20.337
Oh, no! I totally forgot.
I gotta go, I'm so sorry.

01:00:21.091 --> 01:00:24.127
Our lives are made up
of seemingly simple decisions.

01:00:24.594 --> 01:00:29.719
This decision, right here,
right now, is one of yours.

01:00:30.308 --> 01:00:32.051
So you have to ask yourself,

01:00:33.645 --> 01:00:36.930
do you want to be a god or don't you?

01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:01.673
Dani!

01:01:02.966 --> 01:01:04.543
Dani, wait!

01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:06.553
Sorry.

01:01:07.011 --> 01:01:09.004
Hey, are you okay?

01:01:09.097 --> 01:01:11.808
That was a really cute picture
Charlotte posted of the two of you.

01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:13.661
At least, I think it was you.
I couldn't quite tell

01:01:13.685 --> 01:01:15.620
because she was practically
swallowing your face.

01:01:15.645 --> 01:01:17.803
- I was gonna tell you, th...
- Why?

01:01:17.897 --> 01:01:20.982
We're just buddies.
You don't owe me anything.

01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:26.524
I'm happy for you, Kyle.
You're the new Derek.

01:01:28.825 --> 01:01:31.909
Hey! Hey! I'm still me.

01:01:33.872 --> 01:01:34.986
Are you sure about that?

01:01:39.669 --> 01:01:41.460
Lonnie. Lonnie!

01:01:42.505 --> 01:01:45.921
Moore! Yeah, baby, let's go!

01:01:49.012 --> 01:01:51.419
Come on, now, kid! Moore, wake up!

01:01:52.056 --> 01:01:54.548
I've seen better hands on a clock!

01:01:54.642 --> 01:01:56.801
Get your head out of your backside!

01:01:58.021 --> 01:01:59.021
Skate!

01:01:59.063 --> 01:02:00.558
Oh, come on!

01:02:05.737 --> 01:02:09.687
Congratulations, boys, that was
the worst practise we have ever had!

01:02:14.537 --> 01:02:16.744
- What's up, Grimace?
- Douche, Grimace.

01:02:22.629 --> 01:02:23.909
- Hey.
- What do you want?

01:02:25.465 --> 01:02:27.623
Look, I'm sorry I missed your party,
all right?

01:02:27.717 --> 01:02:30.469
You embarrassed me.
I thought we were friends.

01:02:30.845 --> 01:02:31.888
We are.

01:02:32.972 --> 01:02:35.517
Look, you don't have to be the person
people pick on any more.

01:02:35.975 --> 01:02:37.828
You want to go on your magic app
and change me, too?

01:02:37.852 --> 01:02:38.931
Yes!

01:02:39.896 --> 01:02:43.763
Yes. You can be whoever,
whatever you want.

01:02:44.609 --> 01:02:47.147
We can rule the school together.
We can do whatever.

01:02:47.237 --> 01:02:50.154
I am who I want to be.
You're the one who changed.

01:02:50.615 --> 01:02:54.316
You know what?
You, and that thing... that's a virus.

01:02:55.912 --> 01:02:57.490
You've catfished yourself.

01:03:12.303 --> 01:03:13.680
Alden residence.

01:03:14.347 --> 01:03:16.304
Kyle Moore... here.

01:03:44.461 --> 01:03:47.212
Hey. Oh, no, Kyle.

01:03:47.297 --> 01:03:48.339
What? What's wrong?

01:03:48.423 --> 01:03:49.674
You drove that old thing here?

01:03:51.009 --> 01:03:52.552
Charlotte, it's a classic Alfa Romeo.

01:03:52.677 --> 01:03:55.221
Hide it and take it around the back
and park it with the help.

01:04:05.148 --> 01:04:06.191
Say something.

01:04:08.026 --> 01:04:11.810
So, Mr Alden, uh,
Charlotte tells me you're a lawyer?

01:04:11.905 --> 01:04:13.382
Where did you say you were
from again, Carl?

01:04:13.406 --> 01:04:14.865
It's Kyle, Daddy.

01:04:15.533 --> 01:04:16.576
California, sir.

01:04:16.701 --> 01:04:19.572
Sun-baked hippies.
What does your father do for work?

01:04:19.662 --> 01:04:21.122
He was a professional skateboarder.

01:04:21.498 --> 01:04:24.617
Professional skateboarder.

01:04:24.918 --> 01:04:27.076
But now, well, he's an entrepreneur.

01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:29.839
Entrepreneur, that's a fancy word
for unemployed.

01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:36.133
Kyle just got named captain
of the hockey team.

01:04:36.971 --> 01:04:39.925
Brutish sport.
I'm going to cut to the chase.

01:04:40.016 --> 01:04:41.594
You're a nice looking, young man.

01:04:41.684 --> 01:04:45.018
But the truth is,
you're just not one of us.

01:04:45.105 --> 01:04:47.181
Daddy, he's the most popular boy
at school!

01:04:47.273 --> 01:04:49.515
It's for the best, trust me, poopy.

01:04:49.609 --> 01:04:50.753
- Dad!
- Can I use the bathroom?

01:04:50.777 --> 01:04:54.360
Masterson, show the boy to the washroom
and make sure he doesn't steal anything.

01:04:56.533 --> 01:05:00.482
Now, poopy, don't pout,
you'll give yourself wrinkles.

01:05:03.206 --> 01:05:04.321
Not one of you, huh?

01:05:12.298 --> 01:05:13.758
Let's see what you think of me now.

01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:16.968
So, how are we doing in here?

01:05:17.053 --> 01:05:20.173
Kyle! I was starting to miss you, son.
Weren't we, Pet?

01:05:20.265 --> 01:05:21.889
We certainly were.

01:05:23.226 --> 01:05:24.554
Daddy? Are you feeling okay?

01:05:24.644 --> 01:05:25.842
Never been better.

01:05:25.937 --> 01:05:30.398
And Kyle, call me Dutch.
Mr Alden sounds so stodgy.

01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:32.607
Well, Dutch, you are a bit stodgy.

01:05:33.361 --> 01:05:37.110
To be honest, I don't know
how Kathy puts up with you.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.239
You son-of-a-gun.

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:48.543
You're terrible.

01:05:49.002 --> 01:05:53.082
He's so awful, it takes me three of these
just to get through dinner.

01:05:53.381 --> 01:05:55.338
She's ploughed 24/7.

01:05:55.592 --> 01:05:58.593
I'm so awful,
I can't stand to be around me!

01:05:59.345 --> 01:06:01.005
Just trying to get away from myself.

01:06:02.182 --> 01:06:06.345
Hey, Masterson, can you stand me?
Be honest. He hates my guts!

01:06:08.104 --> 01:06:09.480
I think it's time for dessert.

01:06:09.564 --> 01:06:12.814
Kyle, would you give me a hand
in the kitchen?

01:06:13.068 --> 01:06:14.110
I'd love to.

01:06:16.738 --> 01:06:18.018
- Look.
- Enough of that.

01:06:18.865 --> 01:06:21.652
You're the greatest.
Now there's a real man.

01:06:24.871 --> 01:06:27.160
Mmm, smells good. What's cooking, Kath?

01:06:29.834 --> 01:06:31.032
You and me.

01:06:32.837 --> 01:06:35.293
Mrs Alden, what are you doing?

01:06:35.381 --> 01:06:39.000
Let's run away together.
Far, far away from here.

01:06:39.761 --> 01:06:41.837
Uh, your husband's in the other room.

01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:44.884
I love you.
You need someone more flexible.

01:06:45.809 --> 01:06:47.054
I was a ballerina, you know.

01:06:47.352 --> 01:06:49.594
That's great, whoa!

01:06:49.687 --> 01:06:51.312
Oh, I like that game.

01:06:51.397 --> 01:06:53.292
This is out of control.
This needs to stop right now.

01:06:53.316 --> 01:06:55.724
I'm totally out of control
and I don't give a damn!

01:06:57.695 --> 01:06:59.355
- Hi, Pet.
- No, no, no, stop!

01:07:00.365 --> 01:07:01.610
Hey!

01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:04.858
Come to me, my little pet.

01:07:07.122 --> 01:07:08.532
Come to me!

01:07:08.623 --> 01:07:11.624
- Mrs Alden, chill!
- Just don't ever say no.

01:07:11.918 --> 01:07:12.961
Stop! Stop!

01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:17.917
Oh, oh, yes! Oh, baby!

01:07:19.175 --> 01:07:20.753
More... what?

01:07:32.105 --> 01:07:34.477
Okay. Come on,
don't do this to me, U-NIVERSE!

01:07:34.566 --> 01:07:36.192
U-NIVERSE, come on, what are you doing?

01:07:37.193 --> 01:07:40.278
Kyle! Come back, Kyle!

01:07:43.032 --> 01:07:44.906
- Take me with you!
- Oh, God!

01:07:44.993 --> 01:07:47.947
- Take me to Paris!
- Oh, you didn't!

01:07:48.288 --> 01:07:49.699
- Wear berets!
- Oh, goodness!

01:07:49.789 --> 01:07:52.161
♪ Frère Jacques
Frère Jacques ♪

01:07:55.795 --> 01:07:57.289
Send me nudes!

01:07:58.423 --> 01:07:59.502
Wait up, wait up!

01:08:00.759 --> 01:08:01.838
Two minutes.

01:08:06.431 --> 01:08:07.474
What?

01:08:09.768 --> 01:08:11.428
Uh, excuse me, ma'am?

01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:13.772
Excuse me, have you seen the bearded dude?

01:08:13.813 --> 01:08:15.557
Could you be a little more specific?

01:08:15.857 --> 01:08:17.435
Real weird, makes bird noises.

01:08:17.692 --> 01:08:21.819
He had a kiosk over here
and he sold phones.

01:08:22.863 --> 01:08:24.383
Are you sure you're in the right mall?

01:08:24.407 --> 01:08:26.158
Because we don't allow
sales carts in here.

01:08:26.242 --> 01:08:28.411
Yes, I'm in the right mall.
I've seen him here twice!

01:08:28.453 --> 01:08:30.492
Sir, are you under the influence?

01:08:30.997 --> 01:08:33.666
I'm not even old enough to drink.
I need the U-NIVERSE app!

01:08:36.252 --> 01:08:37.295
Sorry.

01:08:50.265 --> 01:08:53.765
You know, it's funny how everything
you want to do always falls through.

01:08:53.853 --> 01:08:56.523
You sleep till noon every day.

01:08:57.273 --> 01:08:59.515
You're spending money
that you don't even have.

01:08:59.609 --> 01:09:01.981
Maxi? What's going on?

01:09:02.069 --> 01:09:03.481
They're fighting again.

01:09:03.571 --> 01:09:05.006
And I know you didn't get that job.

01:09:05.031 --> 01:09:06.988
It fell through.

01:09:07.075 --> 01:09:09.113
I mean, seriously,
what do you want me to do?

01:09:09.202 --> 01:09:12.156
Put in an application
at the local coffee shop?

01:09:12.247 --> 01:09:14.183
Let me tell you something,
that's never gonna happen

01:09:14.207 --> 01:09:15.375
because that ain't me, babe.

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:18.951
I did not ask you to come here,
but you came here on your own.

01:09:19.045 --> 01:09:21.370
I don't why. Do you want it to work?

01:09:21.464 --> 01:09:24.964
Show me that you're trying!
You need to be responsible.

01:09:25.218 --> 01:09:28.587
Don't come at me with responsibility.
You always do that.

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.756
Listen, I know about
responsibility, all right?

01:09:30.849 --> 01:09:32.591
- Oh, do you?
- Yes.

01:09:32.684 --> 01:09:33.881
- Do you?
- Yes.

01:09:34.435 --> 01:09:37.935
You know, Kyle still thinks
that you wanted him to live with you,

01:09:38.481 --> 01:09:40.723
and I pulled him away from his dad

01:09:40.817 --> 01:09:44.233
and moved him across country,
because I'm a bad person.

01:09:44.446 --> 01:09:48.064
And I don't dare tell him the truth,
I don't dare.

01:09:50.201 --> 01:09:51.826
It would break his heart.

01:09:53.287 --> 01:09:56.538
I'm sick of covering for you all the time.

01:09:56.833 --> 01:09:58.576
I'm sick of being the bad person.

01:10:12.348 --> 01:10:15.018
Who took a dump in Anthony's trumpet?

01:10:16.102 --> 01:10:17.145
Nobody?

01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:20.479
Because that's what it sounded like.
So let's try that again.

01:10:21.065 --> 01:10:22.145
One, two, three...

01:10:22.233 --> 01:10:25.816
♪ You took on the love
And played the fool ♪

01:10:26.237 --> 01:10:30.235
♪ I found there's no getting over you ♪

01:10:30.992 --> 01:10:32.035
♪ And all this... ♪

01:10:32.077 --> 01:10:35.861
All right, the only problem
I have with what you just did

01:10:35.955 --> 01:10:38.114
is that it sounded terrible.

01:10:38.416 --> 01:10:39.330
You know what?

01:10:39.417 --> 01:10:41.077
Whatever's going on between you two...

01:10:42.170 --> 01:10:44.626
figure it out, fast.

01:10:45.006 --> 01:10:46.584
All right, from the top, here we go.

01:10:46.674 --> 01:10:48.217
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

01:10:48.927 --> 01:10:51.963
You can't do it? It's your song.
You wrote it!

01:10:52.764 --> 01:10:54.349
You're gonna have to do it without me.

01:10:57.602 --> 01:10:58.645
Wait.

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:03.353
You shouldn't quit. I should.

01:11:03.691 --> 01:11:05.693
No, no, no, actually,
you shouldn't quit, either.

01:11:05.735 --> 01:11:08.440
Neither should... stop quitting!
Everybody stop quitting!

01:11:08.655 --> 01:11:11.739
The Slam is in five days,
you cannot quit, Kyle.

01:11:12.909 --> 01:11:13.952
I just did.

01:11:33.346 --> 01:11:35.199
Let's make some noise

01:11:35.223 --> 01:11:40.264
for Coach Milligan and our undefeated,
hot hockey team!

01:11:41.771 --> 01:11:47.477
Thank you. Thanks.
We came in second place last year.

01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:51.187
One point shy of our first trip
to the state championship

01:11:51.281 --> 01:11:54.365
in 20 long, agonising years.

01:11:54.451 --> 01:11:58.318
The last 365 days have been
very tough on coach.

01:11:58.413 --> 01:12:02.363
I shed a lot of tears.
My wife and dog left me.

01:12:02.459 --> 01:12:05.128
I woke up one morning naked
in a chicken coop.

01:12:05.462 --> 01:12:08.546
And I might have killed a man.

01:12:10.216 --> 01:12:15.293
Uh, but that is all in the past,
because tomorrow night,

01:12:15.388 --> 01:12:17.844
we get our first shot at redemption. Yes!

01:12:21.269 --> 01:12:24.389
The reign of the Bulldogs is over!

01:12:24.731 --> 01:12:27.685
This is the year of the Hawks!

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:35.064
I would like to hand the stage
over to the captain of our team

01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:37.988
and the man who is
gonna lead us all the way

01:12:38.078 --> 01:12:41.411
to the Connecticut Cup, Kyle Moore!

01:12:52.175 --> 01:12:54.333
Wow, thanks. Thanks so much.

01:12:55.553 --> 01:12:58.091
It's been a fast and furious ride
ever since I got here.

01:12:58.348 --> 01:13:00.886
Don't you mean fast and fraudulent ride?

01:13:13.071 --> 01:13:17.982
He's got you all believing
he's a singer, and a hockey player

01:13:18.243 --> 01:13:19.441
and worst of all...

01:13:21.371 --> 01:13:22.699
a heterosexual.

01:13:23.456 --> 01:13:24.998
But he's none of these things.

01:13:27.293 --> 01:13:30.330
Not without his magic app!

01:13:30.422 --> 01:13:31.464
What?

01:13:31.506 --> 01:13:33.415
He's got a magic app on his phone

01:13:33.758 --> 01:13:37.423
that allows him to be whoever
and whatever he wants.

01:13:38.388 --> 01:13:41.591
This boy you all worship is a lie.

01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:47.268
You're an idiot! Boo!

01:13:47.355 --> 01:13:49.811
It's the truth! I'm telling you!

01:13:50.066 --> 01:13:52.106
Did you hear me? It's a magic app.

01:13:52.193 --> 01:13:54.255
- On his phone!
- All right, come on, let's go, buddy.

01:13:54.279 --> 01:13:57.066
He's a nobody! He's a nobody!

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:00.277
Wait, wait!

01:14:01.578 --> 01:14:04.033
Hold on.
I gotta be honest about some things.

01:14:04.122 --> 01:14:05.746
It's true, four or five weeks ago,

01:14:05.832 --> 01:14:07.667
I'd never played
a game of hockey in my life.

01:14:08.042 --> 01:14:10.082
I never ice skated.
I've never even held a stick.

01:14:10.170 --> 01:14:11.913
He's like the Roy Hobbs of hockey.

01:14:12.005 --> 01:14:14.840
No, listen to me. I don't deserve
any of this attention. I'm...

01:14:14.924 --> 01:14:17.462
An incredibly modest superstar!

01:14:17.552 --> 01:14:20.304
No! I'm trying to tell you!
I'm a fake, a phoney!

01:14:20.388 --> 01:14:21.449
I don't even know who I am!

01:14:21.473 --> 01:14:23.679
- A role model to everyone here tonight.
- Exactly!

01:14:23.767 --> 01:14:26.684
Unless we lose to the Bulldogs,
and then he's dead to every one of us.

01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:29.343
Let's light this fire!

01:14:41.618 --> 01:14:42.660
Kyle?

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:48.991
Dani! Dani, wait, please.

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:51.954
What do you want from me, Kyle?
You have everything.

01:14:52.045 --> 01:14:54.714
You have the fame, the glory.
You even have the girl.

01:14:54.798 --> 01:14:57.467
- What more could you possibly want?
- I don't want any of it.

01:14:57.759 --> 01:15:00.879
This, these clothes, this isn't me.
You know that.

01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:02.928
If I could take it all back right now,

01:15:03.014 --> 01:15:05.386
if I could erase everything, I would.

01:15:05.475 --> 01:15:07.930
- Okay, then why don't you?
- Because I can't.

01:15:09.312 --> 01:15:10.355
You can't?

01:15:12.649 --> 01:15:13.691
Look...

01:15:15.068 --> 01:15:17.310
everything Brian said was true.

01:15:17.862 --> 01:15:20.234
There's this app
and everything I wish for comes true.

01:15:20.323 --> 01:15:22.259
And I wished that I could sing,
so I could get close to you

01:15:22.283 --> 01:15:24.905
and then it happened, and then,
so did everything else.

01:15:25.703 --> 01:15:28.373
And I wanna take it all back, Dani,
but there's nothing I can do.

01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:31.584
Let me just get this straight.

01:15:32.877 --> 01:15:34.585
You've been a jerk because of an app?

01:15:36.256 --> 01:15:38.747
- I know it sounds crazy.
- You know what's even crazier?

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:43.970
I wrote "Drowning" the day after
you took me on the Ferris wheel.

01:16:06.119 --> 01:16:07.697
Hey, can I have your autograph?

01:16:07.787 --> 01:16:09.281
Look, it's been a really long...

01:16:09.831 --> 01:16:11.622
Whoo!

01:16:13.376 --> 01:16:15.832
Turn down for what?

01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:36.436
- You ready to get up?
- I'm not going to school today.

01:16:36.691 --> 01:16:37.806
What now?

01:16:41.154 --> 01:16:42.269
I just don't want to go.

01:16:42.906 --> 01:16:44.614
Well, that's not really a reason.

01:16:44.699 --> 01:16:46.988
You have to convince me
to let you stay home.

01:16:47.077 --> 01:16:49.283
What is it? What's going on with you?

01:16:54.542 --> 01:16:58.540
I posted some things on social media,
and I've hurt people.

01:16:59.798 --> 01:17:04.045
And it all keeps getting worse,
and I've really messed up.

01:17:08.306 --> 01:17:13.051
Okay, well, when you mess up,
and you're gonna mess up,

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:16.476
the only thing you can do is
take ownership of it

01:17:16.856 --> 01:17:19.145
and try to make it right, that's it.

01:17:19.692 --> 01:17:21.151
It's like ripping off a Band-Aid.

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:24.190
It's gonna hurt,
but just do it and it's done.

01:17:24.697 --> 01:17:28.991
And look, social media,
that stuff isn't real, you know that.

01:17:29.828 --> 01:17:31.571
It's just everybody's highlight reel

01:17:31.663 --> 01:17:35.246
of the stuff they want you to see.
It's all bullshit.

01:17:35.333 --> 01:17:38.369
It's bullshit with a filter on it,
to make it look pretty.

01:17:39.003 --> 01:17:40.083
Let's eat.

01:17:41.214 --> 01:17:42.257
Get up.

01:17:42.799 --> 01:17:43.842
Hey, Mom...

01:17:46.219 --> 01:17:47.678
you look really pretty today.

01:17:49.222 --> 01:17:52.591
Thank you, but you still
have to go to school.

01:17:57.772 --> 01:18:01.188
Ugh, good morning, family, huh?

01:18:02.026 --> 01:18:04.778
- What's for breakfast? I'm starving.
- French toast.

01:18:04.863 --> 01:18:08.066
French toast, sounds good.
Hey, you know what?

01:18:08.158 --> 01:18:11.262
We should go down to the park and do some
skating today, that's what we should do.

01:18:11.286 --> 01:18:12.620
Well, how's that job going, Dad?

01:18:14.289 --> 01:18:17.159
Wow, right out of the gates, huh? Just...

01:18:17.751 --> 01:18:22.044
Well, if you gotta know,
um, that one didn't pan out.

01:18:22.505 --> 01:18:24.877
I gotta lot of good leads, though,
so don't sweat it.

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:28.798
More importantly, do we got any powdered
sugar to go with that French toast?

01:18:28.887 --> 01:18:31.460
Only Annie knows the answer.
Annie, talk to me!

01:18:31.973 --> 01:18:35.674
- Powdered sugar!
- Wait, Mom, sit down.

01:18:38.146 --> 01:18:40.851
You okay, killer?
You're acting a little weird.

01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:41.983
I'm fine.

01:18:42.567 --> 01:18:45.028
But Mom's not getting your breakfast
today or any other day.

01:18:45.653 --> 01:18:47.445
The free ride stops right now.

01:18:48.907 --> 01:18:52.157
What are you talking about?
What's going on? Did I miss something?

01:18:52.243 --> 01:18:53.554
- Did you say something?
- Darryl.

01:18:53.578 --> 01:18:55.514
- You said something. He's all worked up.
- Leave her out of this.

01:18:55.538 --> 01:18:56.891
- This is about me and you.
- Is it?

01:18:56.915 --> 01:18:58.290
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:00.994
Well, what is it about you and me?

01:19:07.342 --> 01:19:08.884
When Mom moved me away from you...

01:19:10.303 --> 01:19:11.382
I was so angry...

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:14.006
and hurt, and alone.

01:19:15.475 --> 01:19:18.227
She took me away
from my best friend, my hero.

01:19:19.312 --> 01:19:24.769
I would have done anything
for you to come back in my life

01:19:25.318 --> 01:19:26.481
but the truth is...

01:19:28.822 --> 01:19:30.232
you didn't even want me.

01:19:31.783 --> 01:19:33.657
You didn't even want me.

01:19:34.577 --> 01:19:38.196
I was so wrong, and I made Mom
go through hell because of it.

01:19:38.998 --> 01:19:43.791
But Mom, Maxi and I, we deserve
somebody who wants to be with us,

01:19:44.045 --> 01:19:45.753
and you deserve to live your life.

01:19:46.423 --> 01:19:47.751
As hard as that is...

01:19:49.342 --> 01:19:50.385
I get it now.

01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:54.677
Maxi? You feel the same way?

01:19:59.519 --> 01:20:01.761
Grampa, I know how you feel. All right.

01:20:06.943 --> 01:20:09.399
I guess you're the man of the house.
Congratulations.

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:12.189
I'm gonna go get my breakfast elsewhere.

01:20:24.210 --> 01:20:26.666
- Xing-fu, hey.
- Hey.

01:20:28.131 --> 01:20:29.174
Xing-fu.

01:20:30.008 --> 01:20:31.050
Hey, Kyle.

01:20:33.845 --> 01:20:36.680
I'm sorry for being
such a lousy, little sister.

01:20:37.891 --> 01:20:40.014
I could do a lot worse.

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:03.030
- Hi, Mr Gregory?
- Yes?

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.287
I'm Kyle Moore,
I just wanted to drop by and say hello.

01:21:06.377 --> 01:21:07.420
I'm Lonnie's friend.

01:21:08.963 --> 01:21:12.000
Good God in Heaven, you're real.

01:21:12.592 --> 01:21:15.000
Honey! Honey! Come quick!

01:21:15.095 --> 01:21:16.137
What is it?

01:21:16.638 --> 01:21:19.343
This is Kyle, Lonnie's friend.

01:21:20.683 --> 01:21:23.388
Did he put you up to this?
Is he paying you?

01:21:23.603 --> 01:21:25.975
No, Lonnie's really my friend.

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:29.892
To be honest,
he's actually my best friend.

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.159
Hey, Lonnie.

01:21:47.043 --> 01:21:48.687
I gotta go, but it was great
meeting you guys.

01:21:48.711 --> 01:21:52.875
- The pleasure's ours.
- Come back again. Soon! Please!

01:21:54.509 --> 01:21:55.552
Lonnie!

01:21:57.887 --> 01:22:00.639
- Wait up, man!
- Leave me alone, Kyle.

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:03.508
Hey, don't push off
with your front foot, that's mongo.

01:22:03.601 --> 01:22:05.012
Don't tell me what to do.

01:22:06.688 --> 01:22:09.854
Hey, so get this,
I met this guy in Cleveland,

01:22:09.941 --> 01:22:12.017
says he's a bikini model named Phil.

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.740
You're lucky you're my only friend.

01:22:19.492 --> 01:22:20.535
I'm back, buddy.

01:22:35.467 --> 01:22:37.293
Kyle? Kyle! What are you doing?

01:22:41.848 --> 01:22:43.971
If it isn't the Prince of popularity.

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:46.686
What are you doing over here
with us lepers?

01:22:47.771 --> 01:22:49.051
You don't look so good, bud.

01:22:49.147 --> 01:22:52.598
Well, let's see, I lost my girl,
I lost my scholarships.

01:22:52.692 --> 01:22:54.027
Coach demoted me to fourth line.

01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:55.854
My friends want nothing to do with me

01:22:55.945 --> 01:22:58.132
and now my dad's talking about
sending me to military school.

01:22:58.156 --> 01:23:00.398
So yeah, life's great.
I'm doing fantastic.

01:23:02.243 --> 01:23:04.450
- You got something on your face.
- I don't care.

01:23:04.871 --> 01:23:07.077
What is Kyle doing with that loser?

01:23:07.624 --> 01:23:09.309
- So gross.
- I can't believe I dated him.

01:23:09.334 --> 01:23:10.745
Ugh! I can't believe I slept...

01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:16.339
Um, through third period.

01:23:18.384 --> 01:23:19.629
LOL.

01:23:19.886 --> 01:23:22.459
Come on, Derek, where's that clean cut,
confident guy

01:23:22.555 --> 01:23:23.931
that I hated a few months ago?

01:23:24.182 --> 01:23:26.221
He's you now. I gotta go.

01:23:26.476 --> 01:23:27.756
Wait, wait, wait.

01:23:29.312 --> 01:23:31.518
Look, man, this isn't me.

01:23:32.315 --> 01:23:33.726
I don't want to be this guy.

01:23:34.442 --> 01:23:35.944
I want to help you get on top again.

01:23:36.486 --> 01:23:38.313
I don't know what your game is, all right?

01:23:38.405 --> 01:23:40.841
But if you're looking to bury me
some more, give it your best shot.

01:23:40.865 --> 01:23:42.110
There's no angle here.

01:23:43.576 --> 01:23:45.119
I just want to make things right.

01:23:52.210 --> 01:23:56.160

Hold on, thank you.

01:24:03.972 --> 01:24:07.554
Dani, what's the matter, honey?
Talk to me.

01:24:08.268 --> 01:24:09.548
I'm so sorry.

01:24:10.145 --> 01:24:13.099
I'm sorry, it's the song,
it was written as a duet.

01:24:14.691 --> 01:24:15.859
I don't think I can sing it.

01:24:16.276 --> 01:24:19.230
It's beautiful and you sing it so well.

01:24:19.446 --> 01:24:21.154
It just doesn't feel right any more.

01:24:21.823 --> 01:24:24.314
Is there any way we could go
back to "Hallelujah"...

01:24:26.411 --> 01:24:27.454
please?

01:24:31.166 --> 01:24:36.077
Oh, my God, these girls
with their boy problems.

01:24:36.755 --> 01:24:39.625
Okay, everybody, "Hallelujah",
from the top.

01:24:39.716 --> 01:24:41.527
All right,
you remember how that goes.

01:24:41.551 --> 01:24:43.342
Horns, you want to get your
spittle out now

01:24:43.428 --> 01:24:46.263
so we don't have to watch that later?
Here we go.

01:24:51.686 --> 01:24:52.729
Whoa!

01:24:53.313 --> 01:24:56.479
Charlotte, hey, didn't see you stalking...
standing there.

01:24:57.275 --> 01:24:58.318
Hmm.

01:24:59.444 --> 01:25:00.819
Have you been ignoring me?

01:25:01.362 --> 01:25:03.339
No, why would I be ignoring you?
No, I've just...

01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:05.992
You've been ignoring my texts,
you've been ignoring me at lunch.

01:25:06.284 --> 01:25:10.068
You ignored me at the bonfire.
I will not be ignored, Kyle.

01:25:10.371 --> 01:25:13.372
- Shh!
- Shut up! I will eat your children!

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:14.954
Okay.

01:25:17.170 --> 01:25:18.664
I don't want to fight you.

01:25:19.798 --> 01:25:21.126
I just want to love you.

01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:23.379
Mmm.

01:25:28.598 --> 01:25:30.425
I love you so much.

01:25:31.726 --> 01:25:33.351
We're gonna be together forever.

01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:36.010
Good luck at the game tonight.

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:41.442
I'll be watching every little step.

01:25:43.863 --> 01:25:44.906
Oh, my God.

01:25:47.992 --> 01:25:51.492
Let's go Hawks! Let's go Hawks!

01:26:22.902 --> 01:26:24.487
So, that's the end of my story.

01:26:27.699 --> 01:26:28.778
Where it goes from here,

01:26:30.744 --> 01:26:31.989
only the universe knows.

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:38.120
This my life now.

01:26:40.128 --> 01:26:41.207
I have to live it.

01:26:43.965 --> 01:26:46.041
But, I'm gonna live it my way.

01:26:46.551 --> 01:26:48.460
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:26:49.012 --> 01:26:52.013
please welcome your very own,

01:26:52.098 --> 01:26:56.178
number 17, Kyle Moore!

01:27:09.657 --> 01:27:11.733
How many goals you got in you tonight,
superstar?

01:27:11.826 --> 01:27:13.368
More than they do.

01:27:13.453 --> 01:27:16.026
That's my boy!
Go out there and take the face-off!

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:19.364
Come on, now.

01:27:20.085 --> 01:27:23.500
That's my boy, Kyle. You are my boy!

01:27:23.588 --> 01:27:25.581
All right now, let's play as a team!

01:27:27.217 --> 01:27:28.259
Okay.

01:27:29.219 --> 01:27:31.211
Yeah, boys, let's go, boys!

01:27:31.304 --> 01:27:33.095
Let's win this face-off, let's go!

01:27:43.274 --> 01:27:47.224
Hey, Moore, I got your number tonight.
I'm gonna light you up.

01:27:47.821 --> 01:27:48.651
Let's see what you got?

01:27:48.738 --> 01:27:49.781
Whoo!

01:27:53.326 --> 01:27:55.449
That's my best friend.
That's my best friend.

01:27:56.579 --> 01:27:59.580
- I love you!
- I love you, too!

01:28:00.083 --> 01:28:01.458
Go get him, son!

01:28:05.547 --> 01:28:06.661
Up! Up!

01:28:12.137 --> 01:28:13.216
Look for the opening!

01:28:14.681 --> 01:28:15.723
Nice.

01:28:20.019 --> 01:28:23.435
Nice move! Move it up.
Up the ice, up the ice.

01:28:28.486 --> 01:28:30.526
No!

01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:36.286
What the...

01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:42.367
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:28:42.459 --> 01:28:48.248
No. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:28:48.673 --> 01:28:49.503
Where does it hurt?

01:28:49.591 --> 01:28:51.634
It hurts right there where
you're touching it, ow.

01:28:51.676 --> 01:28:55.460
Sorry, my bad. Listen, look at me!
I'm gonna tell you a story.

01:28:55.555 --> 01:28:59.006
I once played with a broken back,
a broken pubis

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:01.556
a broken leg, an infected urethra,

01:29:01.853 --> 01:29:04.095
and one hell of an epic hangover!

01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:06.395
So you are gonna be fine!

01:29:06.483 --> 01:29:08.641
Now help him up! Jeez!

01:29:12.155 --> 01:29:15.275
Okay, he's good. He's okay!

01:29:17.744 --> 01:29:19.535
I can't do it, Coach. I can't do it.

01:29:19.621 --> 01:29:20.735
So that's a no? Or...

01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:22.206
Don't make me do it, Coach.

01:29:24.250 --> 01:29:26.955
Get him off the ice.

01:29:30.757 --> 01:29:33.295
Why, God, why?

01:29:39.057 --> 01:29:40.385
Back to the chicken coop.

01:29:40.892 --> 01:29:42.137
- Coach!
- What?

01:29:42.227 --> 01:29:43.269
Put me in.

01:29:44.437 --> 01:29:45.480
- Coach.
- What?

01:29:45.522 --> 01:29:46.850
- Stop crying.
- I'm not crying.

01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:48.767
Stop it. I'm gonna win this game for us.

01:29:49.526 --> 01:29:50.688
- Coach!
- Yeah.

01:29:50.777 --> 01:29:52.236
Listen to me, put me in.

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.234
- Okay.
- Now.

01:29:53.321 --> 01:29:57.153
Okay, you're in. Go get them, kid!
Go get them, kid!

01:30:07.627 --> 01:30:09.370

Oh, that was awesome.
You totally deserve an Oscar.

01:30:17.095 --> 01:30:18.864
- Have you thought about acting?
- I wasn't acting.

01:30:18.888 --> 01:30:20.430
- Oh, sorry, dude.
- So, we gotta go.

01:30:20.515 --> 01:30:22.175
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Text my sister.

01:30:22.267 --> 01:30:24.060
- Have everyone meet us at the Slam.
- Okay.

01:30:25.311 --> 01:30:27.849
- Dude, why'd you park there?
- It's super cool!

01:30:32.777 --> 01:30:33.892
Ah!

Thank you, Mr Pookins. Meow.

01:36:34.097 --> 01:36:35.556
Yeah!

01:36:36.307 --> 01:36:37.422
What are you doing here?

01:36:37.892 --> 01:36:39.552
Dani, I know I hurt you.

01:36:40.770 --> 01:36:43.226
I was an idiot, I'm sorry.

01:36:44.399 --> 01:36:45.442
Can you forgive me?

01:36:52.157 --> 01:36:53.699
Hey, take a bow!

01:37:32.322 --> 01:37:33.364
I got my life back.

01:37:35.366 --> 01:37:37.406
Dani, I got my life back.

01:37:51.508 --> 01:37:53.050
That was so good!

01:37:54.427 --> 01:37:55.470
Thanks.

01:37:59.808 --> 01:38:00.850
Kyle?

01:38:02.018 --> 01:38:04.187
You're about as authentic
as a Mexican Prada handbag.

01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:07.763
So this, we're done, okay?
Have a good life.

01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:11.730
- Kyle!
- Hey!

01:38:13.279 --> 01:38:15.355
That was amazing. Oh, my God.

01:38:15.448 --> 01:38:16.646
- You killed it.
- I cried.

01:38:16.741 --> 01:38:17.904
- Thanks, Mom.
- I cried.

01:38:17.992 --> 01:38:20.662
That was pretty dope, dude.
I helped him, so he's my best friend.

01:38:20.745 --> 01:38:22.323
- Wow.
- What's Dad doing here?

01:38:24.082 --> 01:38:26.573
Um, he just wants to say goodbye.

01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:28.949
- Oh.
- Go on.

01:38:37.053 --> 01:38:38.927
- Hey, killer.
- Hey.

01:38:39.639 --> 01:38:42.212
That was some performance in there.
Holy cow!

01:38:42.308 --> 01:38:43.423
Thanks.

01:38:43.726 --> 01:38:47.012
So, look, I think I'm gonna hit the road.

01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:50.316
I just think it's the best thing
for everyone.

01:38:53.319 --> 01:38:54.399
Take care of them.

01:38:56.489 --> 01:38:57.532
I will.

01:39:04.914 --> 01:39:06.243
If you ever need anything...

01:39:06.750 --> 01:39:07.792
I know, Dad.

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:41.242
You okay?

01:39:42.577 --> 01:39:43.822
How could I not be?

01:39:43.912 --> 01:39:47.826
- Aw, group selfie!
- Oh, Kyle, come here.

01:39:47.916 --> 01:39:52.044
Everyone ready?
On three. One, two, three.

01:40:01.346 --> 01:40:02.508
Hey, man.

01:40:03.181 --> 01:40:04.556
Hey!

01:40:04.641 --> 01:40:05.683
Hey, Kyle.

01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:10.511
Hey, remember my neighbour?
She knows who I am now. What?

01:40:12.899 --> 01:40:13.978
Hi, Kyle!

01:40:23.368 --> 01:40:25.286
Dani, I just wanted to say,
whatever happens...

01:40:29.416 --> 01:40:30.495
I'm happy I met you.

01:40:35.505 --> 01:40:36.548
Hey.

01:40:39.968 --> 01:40:41.010
Hey.

01:40:41.594 --> 01:40:43.587
I'm kinda happy I met you, too.

01:42:39.796 --> 01:42:41.670
Hi, sorry to bother you.

01:42:41.756 --> 01:42:43.630
If it's not too much trouble,

01:42:44.050 --> 01:42:49.008
would you be able to fix my phone?
It doesn't, um... work.

01:42:50.807 --> 01:42:51.850
You want to go to Vegas?

01:42:52.225 --> 01:42:55.012
Uh, I should call my wife.

01:42:55.103 --> 01:42:56.431
Yeah, your phone's broken.

01:42:57.147 --> 01:42:58.147
Uh...
