00:00.414 --> 00:02.460
Previously on <i> The Bridge...</i>

00:02.482 --> 00:04.257
I'm Jack Dobbs.

00:04.683 --> 00:08.619
So, you here to see someone?

00:08.687 --> 00:11.455
Your brother.

00:11.523 --> 00:16.160
I'm Sonya Cross, Lisa's sister.

00:24.806 --> 00:26.728
What's going on down here?

00:26.729 --> 00:28.682
Yesterday someone tried to kill me.

00:28.683 --> 00:30.707
It was one of my own men.

00:30.878 --> 00:33.651
- What do you plan to do in the US?
- Work.

00:38.384 --> 00:40.552
Have a nice day.

00:40.619 --> 00:42.721
What the hell is this?

00:46.292 --> 00:49.494
There she goes.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074

01:02.074 --> 01:03.575
Help me.

01:03.642 --> 01:06.177
Come on.

01:06.245 --> 01:08.246
I'm out of here, dude.

01:10.378 --> 01:12.780
Please.

01:13.292 --> 01:15.015
I need help.

01:15.016 --> 01:17.017
I'm cold.

01:32.438 --> 01:34.571
What happened to your clothes?

01:37.443 --> 01:38.977
There was man blood on them.

01:39.044 --> 01:40.919
Maybe we should call the police.

01:40.920 --> 01:42.414
No, no, no.

01:42.415 --> 01:43.849
Please don't.

01:43.850 --> 01:46.118
I'm fine.

01:46.119 --> 01:48.877
You can help me.

01:48.878 --> 01:51.312
Okay.

01:51.791 --> 01:54.359
What's your name?

01:54.427 --> 01:56.962
Kyle.

01:57.275 --> 01:59.800
Have you known grace, Kyle?

02:02.135 --> 02:04.236
Grace.

02:04.616 --> 02:06.776
The light that goes through everything.

02:07.707 --> 02:10.863
I don't know.

02:11.043 --> 02:12.964
I've used up all of mine.

02:13.414 --> 02:16.416
Maybe it's not too late for you.

02:19.070 --> 02:21.705
What are you doing?

02:21.706 --> 02:23.161
Help me.

02:23.162 --> 02:24.513
You have to help me.

02:24.514 --> 02:25.847
Okay, okay, okay, okay,

02:25.848 --> 02:26.881
okay, okay.

02:26.882 --> 02:28.883
Please, please.

02:50.197 --> 02:53.326
If you help me,
I will let you touch me down there.

02:57.923 --> 02:59.924
Okay?

03:42.635 --> 03:44.726
Here.

03:46.319 --> 03:47.950
I don't wear pink.

03:47.951 --> 03:50.709
Come on,
they'll wake up if I go back in there.

03:51.146 --> 03:53.862
It would be bad.
I've never worn pink.

03:55.348 --> 03:59.311
It's for whores and little
girls who want to be princesses.

04:00.453 --> 04:02.387
Okay...

04:02.603 --> 04:05.003
Something else. Please, Kyle.

05:16.503 --> 05:18.284
Here.

05:19.598 --> 05:22.066
What's his name?

05:22.067 --> 05:23.644
Danny.

05:24.970 --> 05:27.467
What are you doing?

05:28.808 --> 05:31.976
Can you see it?

05:32.044 --> 05:34.012
See what?

05:34.383 --> 05:36.594
The light coming off him.

05:37.983 --> 05:40.785
We should go now.

05:47.802 --> 05:50.247
You should say good-bye to him.

05:51.653 --> 05:53.802
Okay...

05:54.433 --> 05:56.434
Good-bye.

07:10.927 --> 07:12.695
Sit.

07:13.059 --> 07:15.060
Good dog.

07:24.807 --> 07:26.141
Tore the carotid.

07:26.208 --> 07:27.475
Yep.

07:27.543 --> 07:29.597
Doesn't look like a knife wound.

07:30.997 --> 07:33.294
Did the job though, didn't it?

07:35.685 --> 07:39.154
Why not a knife?

07:39.221 --> 07:41.517
Used what was handy, I suppose.

07:42.658 --> 07:45.058
So unplanned. Self-defense.

07:45.361 --> 07:47.362
Maybe, maybe not.

07:52.168 --> 07:54.686
Why keep the car running?

07:54.824 --> 07:57.040
Took a while for him to bleed out,
I suppose.

07:57.573 --> 08:00.749
Plus, these electric jobs, you can't tell.

08:01.586 --> 08:04.210
Be nice if something about
this whole thing made sense.

08:07.750 --> 08:10.132
I think there was a woman in the car.

08:15.691 --> 08:17.492
You took a personal
day yesterday, didn't you?

08:18.928 --> 08:21.309
Yeah.

08:22.598 --> 08:24.699
What for?

08:24.840 --> 08:27.645
I have 32 unused personal days.

08:28.904 --> 08:30.505
Did you go see Dobbs?

08:31.367 --> 08:33.741
Nope, I didn't see him.

08:33.743 --> 08:35.844
Dobbs's brother?

08:35.845 --> 08:37.645
Yes, we had lunch.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.881
What for?

08:39.883 --> 08:41.683
I gave him a picture.

08:41.683 --> 08:43.717
We... just... talked.

08:43.719 --> 08:44.953
He's nice.

08:44.954 --> 08:47.159
What'd you talk about?

08:48.557 --> 08:49.724
Lisa.

08:49.725 --> 08:52.293
We talked about Lisa.

08:52.496 --> 08:55.396
That man's brother killed your sister.

08:55.397 --> 08:57.824
That doesn't make him a criminal.

08:58.367 --> 09:02.093
Statistically speaking,
there's no reason to assume that.

09:02.386 --> 09:04.379
Bullshit.

09:06.425 --> 09:09.309
Would you be talking to
me like this if I was a man?

09:10.412 --> 09:12.123
- No.
- Right.

09:12.548 --> 09:13.715
You're right.

09:14.297 --> 09:17.164
- So why don't we just work.
- Okay.

09:17.165 --> 09:18.846
Okay.

09:24.069 --> 09:26.075
- Morning.
- Morning.

09:26.167 --> 09:28.748
Sonya Cross, El Paso PD.

09:29.498 --> 09:31.266
That your work?

09:31.334 --> 09:34.035
I told them I don't do that kind of thing.

09:34.036 --> 09:36.738
- I-I was gonna call you and...
- Make you do what, sir?

09:36.739 --> 09:37.939
The dog?

09:37.940 --> 09:42.981
I-I assume you're
here about what's in the basement.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.482
Right?

09:44.483 --> 09:47.387
They, came in about a month ago.

09:47.583 --> 09:50.208
Didn't-didn't say where
they got my name or number.

09:50.209 --> 09:51.479
Just said they had a job.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.468
There were two of them?

09:54.056 --> 09:55.790
Yeah, the...

09:55.791 --> 09:57.359
Um, a man and a woman.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.861
And this woman, she was... she

09:59.862 --> 10:02.630
was kind of peculiar, you know?

10:02.631 --> 10:04.498
Get their names?

10:04.499 --> 10:05.700
No, ma'am.

10:05.701 --> 10:06.701
I-I didn't ask.

10:06.702 --> 10:09.370
I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but
I-I was very clear with them.

10:09.438 --> 10:11.439
I told them I did not want this job.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.640
The partner, he said he was

10:12.708 --> 10:14.776
going to cut off my hands
and kill my entire family.

10:14.777 --> 10:16.711
Plus, they-they paid cash.

10:16.712 --> 10:18.821
Um, it's-it's... it's right in here.

10:27.289 --> 10:29.290
Um...

11:20.173 --> 11:22.470
Luisa?

15:18.914 --> 15:21.649
Taxidermist said he took
this bullet out of the dog.

15:22.053 --> 15:23.894
What about the body?

15:23.895 --> 15:26.341
Well, the beetles pretty
well took care of the prints,

15:26.342 --> 15:28.189
so we'll submit dental records.

15:28.190 --> 15:30.191
Okay.

15:31.193 --> 15:33.194
Okay.

16:03.222 --> 16:04.389
Hey!

16:04.390 --> 16:06.391
Joe, what can I do for you?

16:07.993 --> 16:11.054
That's our dog, Yankee.

16:13.232 --> 16:15.700
The dog was mentioned
in a crime scene flyer your

16:15.701 --> 16:16.701
department circulated.

16:16.702 --> 16:18.336
Well, we were hoping

16:18.337 --> 16:21.189
for help identifying
the John Doe in the car.

16:23.478 --> 16:27.412
I'm gonna need to see the
complete file, everything you got.

16:27.413 --> 16:30.061
You want to tell me why?

16:30.062 --> 16:32.429
Won't know until I've seen the file.

16:32.850 --> 16:35.763
It was a man and a
woman and, like I said, I never

16:35.764 --> 16:38.039
saw either 'em before in my life.

16:40.593 --> 16:42.360
That him?

16:43.130 --> 16:47.165
Yes, yes, ma'am,
that-that-that was him.

16:47.854 --> 16:49.534
What about the woman?

16:49.535 --> 16:50.702
Well, she was...
She was like the boss.

16:50.777 --> 16:54.772
She had this big ledger book, and she
went around taking notes about everything.

16:54.773 --> 16:56.974
And she dressed kind of funny.

16:56.975 --> 16:59.677
Um, churchy, or amishy.

16:59.920 --> 17:02.547
So, no dope in the car,
no dope at the taxidermist.

17:02.634 --> 17:05.513
This is the DEA taking an
interest in stuffed dogs?

17:05.515 --> 17:06.951
We are now.

17:07.137 --> 17:10.622
The John Doe you found at
the taxidermist is Jimmy Tecca.

17:10.623 --> 17:13.525
One of ours.
Undercover field agent.

17:13.526 --> 17:14.925
The dog, too.

17:18.931 --> 17:20.865
Sorry for your loss.

17:20.866 --> 17:23.134
However, we caught the case. It's ours.

17:23.135 --> 17:25.566
No, not anymore.

17:28.144 --> 17:31.342
They say anything about the body?

17:31.343 --> 17:35.482
Um, they weren't too happy
when I said I needed to beetle it.

17:36.063 --> 17:38.316
They wanted it mounted?

17:38.384 --> 17:40.752
Posed, yes, ma'am,
but it was too far gone.

17:40.819 --> 17:42.920
Maggots and off gassing, and...

17:43.902 --> 17:46.004
Not to mention the illegality of it all.

17:46.005 --> 17:49.761
But the problem was,
they had it in a storage unit.

17:49.762 --> 17:52.488
Two days in this heat,
there ain't nothing I can do.

17:55.267 --> 17:56.267
Cooper:

18:01.077 --> 18:02.978
Um...

18:03.475 --> 18:05.410
Caramel?

18:05.884 --> 18:08.563
They're from France.
They got this sea salt in the middle.

18:08.914 --> 18:11.482
They're hell on the crowns, but I like 'em.

18:11.677 --> 18:13.418
- I don't do sugar.
- Why not?

18:13.419 --> 18:14.752
It's poison.

18:14.820 --> 18:17.455
Okay.

18:17.523 --> 18:19.957
So, um... tell you what.

18:19.958 --> 18:22.794
Why don't we sit down,
and I'll tell you what I got, you tell me

18:22.795 --> 18:25.496
what you got, and we act like
law enforcement professionals?

18:25.497 --> 18:26.497
That's good.

18:26.498 --> 18:27.498
Yeah, it's good.

18:27.499 --> 18:29.434
Have another one.

18:29.435 --> 18:34.005
- Who's that?
- Lead investigator Sonya Cross.

18:34.006 --> 18:37.542
Sonya, this is Joe McKenzie
and Pete Rivas from the DEA.

18:37.543 --> 18:38.910
Come on in.

18:38.911 --> 18:40.912
Close the door.

18:43.042 --> 18:45.550
Multiple stab wounds to the carotid.

18:45.551 --> 18:47.456
Passenger fled the scene.

18:47.954 --> 18:51.512
- You know him?
- Yovani Garza.

18:51.513 --> 18:53.950
He's an escort for Fausto Galvan.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.072
There were no drugs in the car.

18:56.073 --> 18:57.807
We've been over that, Sonya.

18:57.808 --> 18:59.765
You get a description
of the passenger?

18:59.766 --> 19:01.602
Female, brunette.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.691
Taxidermist said she has some

19:03.692 --> 19:05.626
sort of ledger with her;

19:05.694 --> 19:08.221
- Thought that she was in charge.
- Interesting.

19:08.222 --> 19:11.640
- Does that ring a bell?
- Could be a girlfriend.

19:11.641 --> 19:13.040
We'll look into it.

19:13.785 --> 19:15.476
What about Agent Tecca?

19:15.477 --> 19:19.707
Agent Tecca and
Yankee were responsible for over

19:19.708 --> 19:22.282
three tons of seizures,
dozens of arrests in Juarez.

19:22.491 --> 19:25.457
They put a serious dent in
Fausto Galvan's operation.

19:25.458 --> 19:27.281
When did he go missing?

19:27.282 --> 19:29.083
Last month.

19:29.084 --> 19:30.520
Our suspects wanted

19:30.521 --> 19:33.554
Agent Tecca mounted,
but the decomp was too bad.

19:33.555 --> 19:35.765
These people are depraved.

19:35.766 --> 19:38.359
We'd prefer you leave
out mention of the taxidermy.

19:38.360 --> 19:41.058
- Something like that can hurt the family.
- Absolutely.

19:41.059 --> 19:43.815
I personally trained Agent Tecca.

19:44.280 --> 19:46.792
We're on the same bowling team.

19:51.806 --> 19:54.913
Okay, um,
so how do you want to chop this up?

19:54.914 --> 19:57.501
Since Tecca was ours,
we'll take the lead on that.

19:57.502 --> 19:59.034
Good, good. We'll take Garza.

19:59.035 --> 20:00.530
What about the
passenger... the woman?

20:00.531 --> 20:02.529
Yeah, we'll want
to be in on that, too.

20:02.530 --> 20:04.184
Just don't make any moves

20:04.185 --> 20:06.394
- without coordinating with us.
- Good.

20:07.364 --> 20:09.222
And I want the dog.

20:09.223 --> 20:11.224
I'm sorry, the
dog is evidence in this case.

20:11.225 --> 20:13.140
The dog is a goddamn
hero; I'm not gonna have

20:13.141 --> 20:14.744
it sitting in some evidence
room gathering dust.

20:14.745 --> 20:16.605
- That is against pro...
- You got a deal.

20:33.815 --> 20:35.883
Brought you a PBJ.

20:35.951 --> 20:38.341
- Are they gone?
- Yes.

20:40.389 --> 20:42.723
Is it safe?

20:42.791 --> 20:43.925
Yes.

20:43.992 --> 20:46.975
I got on the bus and ditched,
just like you told me.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.167
Good boy.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.472
So...

20:58.540 --> 21:00.541
Do you want to touch me now?

21:06.215 --> 21:08.216
Y-yes.

21:09.418 --> 21:11.519
But...

21:11.587 --> 21:13.588
Not here.

21:20.495 --> 21:22.362
Do you drive?

21:22.363 --> 21:24.357
Just have my Learner's permit.

21:24.862 --> 21:26.529
So you drive.

21:26.815 --> 21:29.485
Only with an adult.

21:31.005 --> 21:33.940
I am an adult.

21:45.611 --> 21:47.245
Time for your daily two?

21:47.312 --> 21:48.579
Not yet.

21:48.647 --> 21:50.214
How's that going?

21:50.215 --> 21:52.515
Go a lot better three hours from now.

21:53.790 --> 21:56.239
Don't give me that look.

21:58.508 --> 22:00.444
<i>Hola, buenos tardes.</i>

22:02.094 --> 22:04.779
300 pesos for the first hour,

22:04.780 --> 22:07.381
180 pesos for each additional hour.

22:07.499 --> 22:09.934
Pay in advance. And we out of towels.

22:25.251 --> 22:27.252
Come on.

22:39.718 --> 22:42.499
- Can I get two cokes?
- Sure you don't want to

22:42.500 --> 22:43.648
throw some whiskey in there?

22:43.649 --> 22:46.081
- We're working.
- Yeah, I forgot.

22:51.631 --> 22:54.177
You know, it's rude to stare.

22:54.178 --> 22:55.746
How can you not?

22:55.747 --> 22:58.382
He's six-foot-four and gorgeous.

22:58.383 --> 23:01.083
I'm finding myself genuinely aroused.

23:08.526 --> 23:10.761
Raul Quintana.

23:11.219 --> 23:13.530
You're not saying it right.

23:13.531 --> 23:14.531
<i>Bonito.</i>

23:14.532 --> 23:17.934
Raul Quintana.

23:25.583 --> 23:28.251
<i>Ay, Chihuahua.</i>

23:28.252 --> 23:30.312
So you are... like, that was

23:30.313 --> 23:32.632
<i>muy, muy, Muy Es Caliente.</i>

23:33.117 --> 23:34.351
We want to ask you

23:34.352 --> 23:36.550
some questions about your aunt Millie.

23:38.556 --> 23:40.457
How did you find me?

23:40.525 --> 23:43.493
Your landlord.

23:43.494 --> 23:45.445
Shit.

23:46.864 --> 23:48.698
- Who sent you?
- Nobody.

23:48.699 --> 23:51.895
We're with the <i> El Paso Times.</i> We
just want to ask you some questions.

23:51.897 --> 23:54.704
Yeah, look, a week
after your aunt died, you and

23:54.705 --> 23:56.205
your relatives were deported.

23:56.206 --> 23:57.388
What... look, Daniel Frye.

23:57.390 --> 23:58.356
The <i> Times.</i>

23:58.357 --> 24:00.540
Six months after getting asylum.

24:00.696 --> 24:02.864
This doesn't mean shit to me.

24:03.581 --> 24:05.348
How do I know you're not cops?

24:05.416 --> 24:08.497
Trust me, I'm not a cop.

24:08.586 --> 24:11.519
Did they give you a
reason when they deported you?

24:11.722 --> 24:13.635
I'm not doing this.

24:13.636 --> 24:15.291
No, no, please don't go.

24:15.292 --> 24:16.225
Yeah, anything you can
tell us, at all, about the

24:16.226 --> 24:18.386
60 million bucks, and your aunt,
that'd be amazing.

24:18.496 --> 24:19.851
We just want to know

24:19.852 --> 24:22.678
- how your aunt got mixed up with the Cartel.
- Cartel?

24:23.034 --> 24:25.702
I'm not talking about this.
I want you to leave now!

24:25.703 --> 24:26.969
No, no, chillax, bro.

24:26.970 --> 24:27.970
Just relax...

24:31.876 --> 24:33.251
Hey, Daniel...

24:41.993 --> 24:43.260
You were right.

24:43.261 --> 24:45.262
Come take a look.

24:48.094 --> 24:50.962
A fishing buddy at ice
got me this an hour ago.

24:50.963 --> 24:53.381
- Hank seen this?
- Nope.

24:54.035 --> 24:58.381
The DEA requested the same footage,
same time.

24:59.838 --> 25:02.774
There's your dead guy.

25:04.243 --> 25:06.177
Stop.

25:06.178 --> 25:08.179
Run it back.

25:09.348 --> 25:11.349
There.

25:16.522 --> 25:19.157
Would you call that "Churchy"?

25:19.158 --> 25:20.859
I'd call that downright devout.

25:22.125 --> 25:24.494
Print it. Put out an APB.

25:24.495 --> 25:26.496
Run it by Hank? Loop in the DEA?

25:26.497 --> 25:29.004
They didn't inform us
they pulled the ice tapes.

25:29.005 --> 25:30.090
Put it out.

25:30.091 --> 25:32.559
Yes, ma'am.

27:13.971 --> 27:16.319
<i>Mira.</i>

27:31.243 --> 27:32.945
<i>Si,</i> him.

28:22.637 --> 28:24.912
Please tell me that's a bag full of Oxy.

28:24.913 --> 28:27.322
- I got you aspirin.
- Aspirin's useless.

28:28.931 --> 28:30.754
Hey, if anyone ever asks, I did

28:30.755 --> 28:32.661
this defending your honor at a biker bar.

28:32.703 --> 28:35.783
Yeah, whatever. You
really screwed us on this, Daniel.

28:35.784 --> 28:38.048
It's not my fault.

28:40.538 --> 28:42.546
It's me.

28:44.996 --> 28:47.697
No, hey, hey, hey, hey.

28:48.273 --> 28:52.098
Sorry, honey, I had to do that.
Does it hurt?

28:52.099 --> 28:54.490
Just a little.

28:54.491 --> 28:56.916
I didn't want to be seen talking to you.

28:57.516 --> 29:00.409
Weird shit has been
happening since my aunt died.

29:00.410 --> 29:03.159
- Is someone following you?
- All the time.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.160
Who?

29:05.362 --> 29:06.362
I don't know.

29:06.363 --> 29:08.117
Why would somebody
want to be following you?

29:08.118 --> 29:11.385
The person you want to talk to is Chuchito.

29:11.498 --> 29:13.593
He helped my aunt with the money.

29:13.776 --> 29:16.819
- In what kind of way?
- You have to ask him.

29:17.022 --> 29:20.405
- Were you guys friends?
- Something like that.

29:21.179 --> 29:23.047
I'm-I'm worried.

29:23.048 --> 29:25.282
Haven't seen him in a week.
I'm afraid to go by his place.

29:25.283 --> 29:26.217
Why?

29:26.218 --> 29:28.069
I'm telling you, I'm being watched.

29:28.070 --> 29:29.738
Okay, relax.

29:29.946 --> 29:33.203
If you find him,
can you tell him to call his <i>bomboncito?</i>

29:35.293 --> 29:38.934
- I get it.
- No, something happened to him.

29:39.297 --> 29:41.065
Now, please... I have to go.

29:49.207 --> 29:51.175
You wanted something?

29:51.243 --> 29:53.410
Yep. Come on in.

29:53.478 --> 29:55.479
Close the door.

30:01.486 --> 30:05.107
You didn't tell me that you
had Cooper pull that ice video.

30:05.602 --> 30:07.816
- We got an image.
- And you went ahead and

30:07.817 --> 30:10.060
- put out an apb on this woman?
- Yes.

30:10.061 --> 30:11.061
You were here, Sonya.

30:11.062 --> 30:13.063
You heard what we had agreed
to with those guys.

30:13.192 --> 30:14.832
We owe them a heads-up on something like...

30:14.833 --> 30:17.311
We need to find her
before she goes back to Mexico.

30:17.312 --> 30:19.687
We need for you to follow protocol.

30:21.182 --> 30:23.816
They didn't share the ice tapes with us.

30:23.817 --> 30:26.316
Sonya, something like
this is liable to set them off.

30:26.317 --> 30:28.156
They could shut us out...

30:34.686 --> 30:37.392
I'm sorry.

30:40.125 --> 30:43.210
You're mad at me because of Jack Dobbs,
aren't you?

30:43.211 --> 30:45.529
Nope. This has nothing to do with that.

30:45.530 --> 30:48.124
Yes, it does.

30:48.967 --> 30:51.907
What do you want to know, Hank?

30:51.908 --> 30:53.909
I had sex with him.

30:59.211 --> 31:01.912
And I'm sorry about the APB.

31:01.980 --> 31:04.582
Apology accepted.

31:04.649 --> 31:07.149
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:22.567 --> 31:24.568
You remember me?

31:26.171 --> 31:28.172
Yeah.

31:30.892 --> 31:34.263
I don't remember you and your
brother being that close.

31:35.580 --> 31:37.581
We weren't.

31:39.918 --> 31:42.353
Good to see you, Detective.

31:42.427 --> 31:44.421
Wish I could say the same.

31:48.351 --> 31:51.007
Prefer if you didn't smoke around me.

31:51.695 --> 31:55.599
- Not a smoker?
- Was. Know better now.

32:13.618 --> 32:16.720
You want something,
or is this just some good old boy

32:16.721 --> 32:18.055
meet-and-greet routine?

32:18.123 --> 32:20.591
Just want to talk to you about someone.

32:22.471 --> 32:24.791
Maybe you should have this talk with her.

32:25.097 --> 32:26.530
It's not my place.

32:26.531 --> 32:29.491
So you came to see me?

32:30.596 --> 32:33.272
See, Sonya has a focus problem.

32:33.512 --> 32:36.146
She gets too focused...
makes her a great cop,

32:36.147 --> 32:38.708
but... personal life is not so good.

32:39.988 --> 32:42.146
I think she can handle herself.

32:42.147 --> 32:44.475
It's not her I'm worried about.

32:45.650 --> 32:47.418
One thing this job teaches you

32:47.485 --> 32:49.974
is that bad doesn't just happen,
it's bred in.

32:51.644 --> 32:53.657
Now, you might be a fine member

32:53.658 --> 32:55.592
of society, contributing to the

32:55.593 --> 32:58.177
betterment of mankind...

32:58.581 --> 33:01.583
But... he's your brother.

33:04.669 --> 33:06.904
You share the same blood.

33:09.674 --> 33:11.442
You share all the same messed-up

33:11.509 --> 33:13.177
shit that went into making the

33:13.244 --> 33:15.751
kind of human that takes
the life of another human.

33:17.649 --> 33:20.520
That's in <i> you,</i> Jack.

33:21.353 --> 33:23.751
I know that sounds harsh,
but it's the truth.

33:29.461 --> 33:32.382
We both know what
happened in that hotel room.

33:32.383 --> 33:34.384
You tell her that?

33:36.968 --> 33:39.358
Do the Christian thing,
see your brother into the

33:39.359 --> 33:41.655
ground, and then go back
to where you came from.

35:29.447 --> 35:32.282
Come in.

35:32.350 --> 35:34.284
Close the door.

35:41.688 --> 35:45.057
Are you an ogre man or a troll man, Rivas?

35:45.268 --> 35:48.011
I like <i> Call of Duty</i> and pussy.

35:50.535 --> 35:52.703
You make up your mind?

35:55.473 --> 35:58.875
That shitbird Fausto
Galvan was gonna hang our

35:58.876 --> 36:00.644
friend on a wall.

36:01.055 --> 36:03.647
So let's hang him on one instead.

36:03.648 --> 36:07.033
She's in El Paso.
You want me to get some guys together?

36:07.034 --> 36:10.554
No.
I want to let the local cops chase her,

36:10.555 --> 36:11.488
let <i>them</i> break trail.

36:11.489 --> 36:13.557
We should be lead on this.

36:13.558 --> 36:17.228
No. The second we file an
action report on this,

36:17.229 --> 36:20.798
DC hears about it,
and we have the CIA all up in our shit.

36:20.799 --> 36:24.049
- So we're careful.
- And quiet.

36:24.050 --> 36:27.738
The last thing I want...
is the Mexican government

36:27.739 --> 36:31.408
snatching him for their
"New Mexico" PR campaign.

36:31.409 --> 36:34.018
Either scenario, he's not getting

36:34.019 --> 36:36.852
ass-raped in a Colorado supermax.

36:43.187 --> 36:46.523
I want the whole Enchilada...

36:46.591 --> 36:49.613
Fausto Galvan arrested in the US,

36:49.614 --> 36:54.145
convicted in the US,
and locked up in one of our prisons.

36:55.884 --> 36:58.185
Are you with me?

36:59.324 --> 37:01.225
It's right up here.

37:01.226 --> 37:05.368
Who do you think we're gonna find?
Chuchito or chuchita?

37:06.950 --> 37:08.847
- Four, yeah?
- Yeah.

37:14.186 --> 37:16.440
Might as well try, right?

37:16.441 --> 37:17.140
Damn!

37:17.208 --> 37:18.989
It's open.

37:18.990 --> 37:20.880
Hello?

37:21.541 --> 37:23.558
Hello?

37:23.559 --> 37:25.426
Chuchito?

37:26.156 --> 37:27.590
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

37:27.591 --> 37:29.592
Go, go, go, go.

37:31.795 --> 37:33.729
Yeah.

37:33.730 --> 37:35.976
My God!

37:37.996 --> 37:40.998
Stinks.

37:40.999 --> 37:43.397
Hey... throw this over your face?

37:43.398 --> 37:45.168
Thank you.

37:48.679 --> 37:50.046
Hello?

37:50.047 --> 37:51.940
Daniel, Daniel, we shouldn't.

37:52.230 --> 37:55.161
It's only bad if we get caught, right?

38:07.633 --> 38:10.769
Rayburn National... Bank.

38:27.318 --> 38:29.753
Daniel!

38:29.754 --> 38:31.755
Daniel!

38:46.221 --> 38:48.998
Don't open it. Don't-don't open it.

38:48.999 --> 38:51.500
Too late.

40:50.945 --> 40:52.779
Yovani Garza.

41:04.327 --> 41:06.158
Okay.

41:17.907 --> 41:19.908
No...

41:38.969 --> 41:41.541
Marco Ruiz.

43:35.373 --> 43:37.135
- Hi.
- Hi.

43:37.504 --> 43:38.937
Wow.

43:39.130 --> 43:40.898
What happened to your finger?

43:41.457 --> 43:43.572
I'm replacing the bathtub.

43:43.573 --> 43:45.415
The tiles are bad.

43:45.416 --> 43:47.159
You know how to do that?

43:47.160 --> 43:48.666
No.

43:50.283 --> 43:52.999
Okay.

43:55.302 --> 43:57.303
Can I come in?

44:01.905 --> 44:03.906
Sure.

44:15.405 --> 44:17.505
Would you like a glass of water?

44:17.584 --> 44:19.809
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

44:27.299 --> 44:30.630
I'm sorry about the other day.

44:31.683 --> 44:33.863
You came all this way to apologize?

44:35.328 --> 44:37.262
No.

44:37.263 --> 44:39.623
Not really.

44:41.583 --> 44:44.474
Yovani garza case, you have it, right?

44:44.475 --> 44:45.976
Yes.

44:46.298 --> 44:48.488
DEA is involved, too.

44:49.490 --> 44:52.091
Okay.

44:52.287 --> 44:54.592
That changes things.

44:57.274 --> 44:59.669
He's one of ours.

44:59.670 --> 45:02.025
A Mexican national.

45:02.026 --> 45:03.417
He's cartel.

45:03.418 --> 45:05.385
Yes.

45:06.055 --> 45:08.963
Captain Robles sent me
here to work the case.

45:10.041 --> 45:12.666
With you.

45:14.387 --> 45:17.442
He's sending you to
keep an eye on the Americans?

45:18.145 --> 45:20.426
Yeah, something like that.

45:26.794 --> 45:29.012
Well, I'm glad it's you.

45:31.724 --> 45:33.969
Me, too.

45:34.965 --> 45:37.934
Can I see what you have?

45:37.935 --> 45:39.870
Sure.

45:39.871 --> 45:41.804
That's all we got.

45:41.805 --> 45:45.112
Not a professional job, you agree?

45:47.200 --> 45:49.060
Who else was in the car?

45:50.842 --> 45:53.107
He crossed with a woman.

45:53.895 --> 45:56.340
Kind of strange-looking.

45:56.341 --> 45:58.426
Yes, she is.

45:59.906 --> 46:02.474
Do you recognize her?

46:02.475 --> 46:04.445
No.

46:06.191 --> 46:08.246
Okay.

46:08.247 --> 46:11.504
So show me everything you have.

46:21.051 --> 46:23.676
Your friend who saw me in the park...

46:23.722 --> 46:25.664
- You mean Dex?
- Dex.

46:25.665 --> 46:27.992
Where does he live?

46:27.993 --> 46:29.817
What?

46:30.196 --> 46:33.965
He's cute. I want to know where he lives.

46:34.033 --> 46:36.000
On Keller.

46:36.001 --> 46:38.421
It's the green house with a hoop in front.

46:38.485 --> 46:40.047
Address?

46:40.048 --> 46:41.327
I don't know.

46:41.328 --> 46:44.140
Like I said, it's green.

46:47.713 --> 46:49.979
Can I ask you a question?

46:49.980 --> 46:51.914
Yes.

46:52.450 --> 46:55.034
Why do you have all those tattoos?

46:57.591 --> 47:00.740
They are marks to remember
the demons I've known.

47:01.631 --> 47:03.583
Okay.

47:04.897 --> 47:07.632
Not real demons.

47:07.633 --> 47:09.634
Cool.

47:13.906 --> 47:15.473
What's that smell?

47:15.541 --> 47:17.809
A raccoon.

47:17.876 --> 47:20.878
It crawled in here and died.

47:24.984 --> 47:26.985
It's okay.

47:37.229 --> 47:39.955
What's shared in private
should be kept private.

47:40.165 --> 47:42.700
Do you agree?

47:42.768 --> 47:43.901
Yeah.

47:43.969 --> 47:45.970
I guess.

47:48.807 --> 47:50.174
Have you been with a woman before?

47:51.837 --> 47:53.838
No.

47:59.797 --> 48:02.414
Would you like to touch?

48:03.016 --> 48:06.118
Here?

48:06.859 --> 48:08.926
Yes.

48:08.994 --> 48:12.497
I-I can't see anything.

48:15.534 --> 48:17.535
That's okay.

48:19.775 --> 48:24.045
The light will come.

48:24.777 --> 48:27.645
It will pass through you.
