Good bye, Carl.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.880
Goodbye

00:51.930 --> 00:53.210
forever.

00:56.440 --> 00:59.480
Truly they were...

00:59.540 --> 01:02.080
an
Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

01:06.680 --> 01:08.030
You're emergency
brake is on!

01:08.080 --> 01:09.960
Don't tell me how
to drive, jackass.

01:11.820 --> 01:13.030
There it is!

01:13.090 --> 01:14.360
Ha, ha, jack pot.

01:14.420 --> 01:15.400
We're here!

01:15.460 --> 01:16.990
Say hello to
your new home, boys!

01:17.060 --> 01:18.230
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

01:18.290 --> 01:19.900
You need a jump start or
something to get outta here?

01:19.960 --> 01:21.370
No man,
we're renting over here now.

01:21.430 --> 01:23.410
Yeah, cuts down on
our commute time

01:23.470 --> 01:24.670
to your house.

01:24.730 --> 01:25.580
Cool, huh?

01:25.630 --> 01:26.480
No, uh, no.

01:26.540 --> 01:27.510
Hey look at this guy.

01:27.570 --> 01:29.050
Think I'd better
go introduce myself.

01:29.100 --> 01:30.410
Hello neighbor!

01:30.470 --> 01:33.450
- My name's Master Shake.
-Okay, alright.

01:33.510 --> 01:34.010
Could swear, I've seen
you somewhere before.

01:34.080 --> 01:35.750
- Great house you got here.
- Real funny, there.

01:35.810 --> 01:36.690
I love the bushes.

01:36.750 --> 01:37.620
So, what do you
do around here?

01:37.680 --> 01:39.090
No, no, where' not
playing that game.

01:39.150 --> 01:40.220
What game?
I don't play games.

01:40.280 --> 01:41.820
- Ok, fine.
- What do you do?

01:41.880 --> 01:43.120
Maybe we can network.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.100
No, as you well know...

01:45.150 --> 01:46.570
I work outta the home!

01:46.620 --> 01:50.430
Aahhh!

01:50.490 --> 01:52.340
Oooh, my bad hip!

01:52.390 --> 01:53.570
Oh, sorry
about that man.

01:53.630 --> 01:54.570
I thought I saw
a mosquito on

01:54.630 --> 01:55.470
your shoulder.

01:55.530 --> 01:57.240
I have to go
in and relax.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.540
I don't do well
on long drives...

01:59.600 --> 02:00.510
Shake,
don't run off.

02:00.570 --> 02:01.670
I'm not running off.

02:01.740 --> 02:02.840
I got medical problems.

02:02.910 --> 02:03.750
You better get back
here and help us

02:03.810 --> 02:04.910
unload this van.

02:04.970 --> 02:07.010
Fine.
Open the back.

02:11.950 --> 02:14.430
There,
are we done?

02:14.480 --> 02:16.220
Where the "f" is
my flamethrower?

02:16.290 --> 02:18.320
Oh that, uh,
probably got lost in the

02:18.390 --> 02:19.370
move.

02:19.420 --> 02:20.730
Well that's
a quick response.

02:20.790 --> 02:22.270
Maybe you hid
my flamethrower

02:22.320 --> 02:25.270
because I make
poor choices with it.

02:25.330 --> 02:26.530
My jam box!

02:26.600 --> 02:29.300
Yeah, this is my jam.

02:29.370 --> 02:31.210
Now come, now.
Yeah...

02:31.270 --> 02:32.640
Why ain't you
dancin', Shake?

02:32.700 --> 02:34.010
Dancing is forbidden!

02:34.070 --> 02:35.280
Dancing has always been

02:35.340 --> 02:36.210
forbidden!

02:40.640 --> 02:42.550
Come on, you guys,
we're in a new house now

02:42.610 --> 02:44.320
and we're
starting fresh.

02:44.380 --> 02:45.550
You two need
to learn how to

02:45.610 --> 02:46.620
share and be nice.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.160
But he's
the one dancing.

02:48.220 --> 02:49.390
I ain't
bothering you.

02:49.450 --> 02:50.900
I'm just getting
my groove on, man.

02:50.950 --> 02:52.330
Shake,
he's not bothering you.

02:52.390 --> 02:53.390
Uh-huh.

02:53.460 --> 02:55.990
And plus,
his radio hurt my foot.

02:56.060 --> 02:56.900
You're almost
40 years old, Shake.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.670
You're supposed to be
more mature than this, man.

02:58.790 --> 03:00.300
Well, I'm going
through a phase

03:00.360 --> 03:01.310
right now.

03:01.360 --> 03:03.600
Plus...
he is 38.

03:03.670 --> 03:04.580
He doesn't
know any better.

03:04.630 --> 03:05.870
He's never gonna know any better,
and you know that.

03:05.930 --> 03:07.410
I'd be
38 in July

03:07.470 --> 03:09.610
and I wanna have a
big birthday party

03:09.670 --> 03:11.310
with piñata
and balloons

03:11.370 --> 03:12.610
and Ben 10

03:12.670 --> 03:13.520
Whoops.

03:13.580 --> 03:14.580
Oh!
He pushed me!

03:14.640 --> 03:16.050
No parking on
the dance floor.

03:16.110 --> 03:17.020
Did you see that?!

03:17.080 --> 03:18.020
I didn't see
no parking space!

03:18.080 --> 03:19.250
Both of you go
to your room!

03:19.310 --> 03:21.290
I guess I'll just
move all this

03:21.350 --> 03:23.760
shit by myself.

03:23.820 --> 03:24.820
Up top!

03:24.890 --> 03:26.030
Yeah boy!
I hate work!

03:26.090 --> 03:27.190
As do I.

03:27.260 --> 03:28.200
As do I, too.

03:28.260 --> 03:29.330
You went off
script a little,

03:29.390 --> 03:31.200
but I liked
that ad-lib.

03:31.260 --> 03:32.930
- What, the push?
- Nice touch.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.700
Soon as it gets violent,
it's a game change

03:34.760 --> 03:35.610
Oh, yeah.

03:35.660 --> 03:36.540
You gotta
defuse it.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.940
It played off
my stunt pretty well.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.170
That said, tomorrow we're
gonna have to really stick

03:41.240 --> 03:42.270
close to the script.

03:42.340 --> 03:43.480
Hey talking
about building a

03:43.540 --> 03:44.640
garden.

03:44.710 --> 03:46.340
- I ain't doing that.
- Me neither.

03:46.410 --> 03:47.250
No way, no how.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.480
I mean, I'll
eat the stuff but

03:48.540 --> 03:49.390
I ain't
workin' in it.

03:49.450 --> 03:50.420
I ain't eatin
it unless he's

03:50.480 --> 03:52.250
growing some chicken
nuggets out there.

03:52.310 --> 03:53.880
Who's room is
this gonna be?

03:53.950 --> 03:55.520
I don't know...
Wait it's

03:55.580 --> 03:56.430
It's my room!

03:56.490 --> 03:59.190
No it's my room!
I called it!

03:59.250 --> 04:00.360
Yeah, you're right.

04:00.420 --> 04:01.730
This is your room.

04:01.790 --> 04:03.000
That's right it is.

04:03.060 --> 04:04.260
I'm putting up
my "Whitesnake in

04:04.330 --> 04:05.570
the Still of
the Night" poster

04:05.630 --> 04:07.970
right here.

04:08.030 --> 04:10.510
And over here I'm puttin'
up a sign that says,

04:10.570 --> 04:12.640
"No Girls Allowed".

04:12.700 --> 04:13.540
What's this right here?

04:13.600 --> 04:14.440
Is this a
drinking fountain?

04:14.500 --> 04:15.350
Yeah, it's a

04:15.400 --> 04:16.250
drinking fountain!

04:16.310 --> 04:17.839
Right!
Take a drink outta there.

04:17.910 --> 04:19.110
No dummy.

04:19.170 --> 04:20.410
It's a sponge bath.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.110
You dip your
hands in here,

04:22.180 --> 04:24.350
splash a little
water on your face,

04:24.410 --> 04:25.650
catch the pits,

04:25.710 --> 04:27.130
then you
sponge off.

04:27.180 --> 04:28.990
Someone left
a big long brown sponge

04:29.050 --> 04:30.360
in there.

04:30.420 --> 04:31.860
I had that sponge
included in the

04:31.920 --> 04:33.420
house buying contract.

04:33.490 --> 04:34.560
What this lever do?

04:35.990 --> 04:37.130
Hey,
that my sponge!

04:37.190 --> 04:38.600
I'll get
you another one.

04:38.660 --> 04:41.270
Hey, I think I feel
a sponge coming on.

04:41.330 --> 04:43.810
Hold on, Meatwad. Careful...

04:43.870 --> 04:46.680
I think my sponge
bath is a window

04:46.740 --> 04:48.720
To another dimension.

04:48.770 --> 04:49.840
That's a good assumption.

04:49.910 --> 04:54.150
We gotta find out for sure.
Someone's gotta go in there.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.310
Pull the lever.

04:55.380 --> 04:56.690
Engage.

04:56.750 --> 04:58.050
Portal open!

04:58.110 --> 04:59.220
I'm trapped!

04:59.280 --> 05:00.690
Between
two dimensions.

05:00.750 --> 05:02.090
Your molecules
are too big!

05:02.150 --> 05:03.260
The portal won't hold!

05:03.320 --> 05:04.660
Increase the force!

05:06.890 --> 05:09.500
I suggest we never go to
that dimension again

05:09.560 --> 05:11.540
'cause it's boring and

05:11.590 --> 05:12.440
stinky.

05:12.490 --> 05:13.700
No one touches
the sponge

05:13.760 --> 05:14.970
bath from now on.

05:15.030 --> 05:16.340
You're just
jealous because

05:16.400 --> 05:18.640
we can do science
stuff too and

05:18.700 --> 05:19.800
we didn't
have to get a

05:19.870 --> 05:21.110
stupid degree online.

05:21.170 --> 05:22.440
It comes
naturally to us.

05:22.500 --> 05:23.640
Yeah, okay, just help me
roll this into the

05:23.710 --> 05:24.580
garage.

05:24.640 --> 05:25.620
Why don't
you help me suck it.

05:28.340 --> 05:30.320
Wait a minute, that
backfired.

05:30.380 --> 05:32.480
See, that sounded like
I suck it all the time.

05:32.980 --> 05:34.220
Which I don't.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.090
Also implies
that I would need

05:36.150 --> 05:38.720
help which we both
know that I don't.

05:38.790 --> 05:40.490
I can suck
my own stuff.

05:40.560 --> 05:42.630
Listen,
when I'm on, it's

05:42.690 --> 05:43.730
dangerous.

05:43.790 --> 05:45.860
Me and this cart
been through

05:45.930 --> 05:47.310
a lot together.

05:47.360 --> 05:50.070
I got me some
fond memories.

05:50.130 --> 05:51.840
This ain't no vacation.

05:51.900 --> 05:53.470
Keep goin'
the way you goin'.

05:53.540 --> 05:57.280
Oh, yeah...
Keep goin'... brilliant.

05:57.340 --> 06:02.150
Where is this farm?
Where is this farm?

06:02.210 --> 06:07.590
There is no way
I'm head in this state!

06:07.650 --> 06:09.820
I ain't got
no fond memories.

06:09.890 --> 06:12.090
Back to hell from
whence you came!

06:12.150 --> 06:13.830
Hey... where did
you get a gun?

06:13.890 --> 06:14.830
From my teacher.

06:14.890 --> 06:15.990
Yeah, they
give 'em out now.

06:16.060 --> 06:17.970
You need
some help there?

06:18.030 --> 06:19.700
Yeah, I've got
about 60 boxes

06:19.760 --> 06:20.640
out here...

06:20.700 --> 06:22.470
Erosion... the

06:22.530 --> 06:24.810
plodding enemy... like

06:24.870 --> 06:27.010
Frankenstein
it attacks our

06:27.070 --> 06:27.910
shores...

06:27.970 --> 06:28.850
Never mind.
I got it...

06:28.900 --> 06:30.040
This is
educational!

06:30.110 --> 06:31.310
When are we
hooking up the

06:31.370 --> 06:32.250
boob channels?

06:32.310 --> 06:34.690
Oh, wow. Check this out...
Remember these?

06:34.740 --> 06:38.190
We was detectives...
For like a week.

06:38.250 --> 06:39.780
Feels like a lifetime
ago, don't it?

06:39.850 --> 06:41.690
You know, I could have
been a really good

06:41.750 --> 06:42.590
detective.

06:42.650 --> 06:43.650
Ooh,
who farted?

06:43.720 --> 06:44.560
Not me.

06:44.620 --> 06:46.000
Dang.
You a good detective.

06:46.050 --> 06:47.430
Yeah, I was good,
wasn't I?

06:47.490 --> 06:48.470
Yeah, you was.

06:48.520 --> 06:49.970
Well, I tell you what
I'll keep one.

06:50.030 --> 06:51.060
Just to remember
that time in my

06:51.130 --> 06:52.430
life, alright.

06:52.490 --> 06:53.340
Dammit, Shake!

06:53.400 --> 06:55.430
Aqua Teen Hunger Force...
Assemble!

06:55.500 --> 06:58.100
Check out how I
did up my new room.

06:58.170 --> 06:59.610
Radicalized!

06:59.670 --> 07:01.480
And this is a
framed poster of

07:01.540 --> 07:03.280
Monet because
there's a

07:03.340 --> 07:05.380
sensitive side
of me, too.

07:05.440 --> 07:06.820
Bitches are gonna be
drippy wet when they

07:06.880 --> 07:09.190
see his famous
lilies stuff.

07:09.240 --> 07:10.660
And...
Hello...

07:10.710 --> 07:11.820
I'm introspective too.

07:11.880 --> 07:13.550
That's what this
mirror is for.

07:13.620 --> 07:15.530
Introspecting
my throbbing

07:15.580 --> 07:17.590
pythons and
enormous genitals.

07:17.650 --> 07:20.430
The word you're looking for,
gentlemen, is incredible.

07:20.490 --> 07:22.980
Hey, Shake... Can you help me?

07:25.460 --> 07:27.030
I need to slide
this Jacuzzi

07:27.100 --> 07:30.130
over in front
of the salad bar

07:30.200 --> 07:32.580
so the stallions
won't get at it.

07:32.630 --> 07:33.580
What do you mean,
stallions?

07:33.640 --> 07:34.480
Arabian.

07:34.540 --> 07:35.840
That's what
come with my room.

07:35.900 --> 07:40.110
I don't see my
egg roll noodles?

07:40.180 --> 07:41.520
I see
garlic croutons but I

07:41.580 --> 07:42.820
don't see no
egg roll noodles.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.380
And that pisses me off.

07:44.450 --> 07:45.750
Shake power activate!

07:45.810 --> 07:47.560
Shake power activate!

07:47.620 --> 07:49.030
Activate Shake power!

07:49.080 --> 07:50.760
Come on!

07:50.820 --> 07:51.820
Hey, hey, chill out!

07:51.890 --> 07:55.700
That's a 60 thousand dollar
rug you spittin' up on.

07:55.760 --> 07:56.860
What flavor is that?

07:56.930 --> 07:59.300
It's the flavor of
"none of your damn business."

07:59.360 --> 08:00.860
How did you get this room?

08:00.930 --> 08:03.270
I guess I was left with it
since you called the bathroom.

08:03.330 --> 08:04.570
Well, I call
this room now.

08:04.630 --> 08:05.770
You can't do that.

08:05.830 --> 08:06.710
L just did.

08:06.770 --> 08:07.870
Shake, he
called it first.

08:07.940 --> 08:08.970
Fine...

08:09.040 --> 08:11.020
I guess we'll just have to
paper, rock, scissors

08:11.070 --> 08:12.070
for it.

08:12.140 --> 08:13.240
It's the only fair way.

08:13.310 --> 08:14.250
No it isn't.
He called it.

08:14.310 --> 08:15.190
I called it.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.420
I understand your
position but,

08:16.480 --> 08:18.860
I'm afraid
this is the best

08:18.910 --> 08:21.360
compromise
I can offer.

08:21.420 --> 08:22.450
Fine.
Let's do it.

08:22.520 --> 08:23.550
Meatwad, you
ain't gotta do this.

08:23.620 --> 08:25.290
No no, we're gonna do this.

08:25.350 --> 08:26.560
He can speak
for himself.

08:26.620 --> 08:27.730
1-2-3.

08:27.790 --> 08:30.030
Paper, covers rock.

08:30.090 --> 08:32.659
This is my room.
The end.

08:32.730 --> 08:34.000
No!
Best of three. 1-2-3.

08:34.059 --> 08:35.909
Oh, he got you again.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.940
Oh, damn,
rock crushes scissors.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.539
I call this room.

08:39.600 --> 08:40.480
Oh yeah?

08:40.539 --> 08:42.710
Well bullet
enters brain!

08:42.770 --> 08:45.120
Hey, where are you goin'?
This is fun.

08:45.170 --> 08:46.650
Let's go best of 5.

08:46.710 --> 08:48.380
1-2-3...

08:48.440 --> 08:50.790
Well,
what the hell is that?

08:50.850 --> 08:52.330
This is a hurricane.

08:52.380 --> 08:54.360
And hurricane smashes beach

08:54.420 --> 08:55.550
condo complex.

08:55.620 --> 08:56.820
No, that's
not what this is.

08:56.890 --> 08:59.130
This is a
time-share that is

08:59.190 --> 09:00.630
more towards town.

09:00.690 --> 09:01.760
Hurricane beats
all housing

09:01.820 --> 09:02.960
or apartments.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.500
And this
sucker is cat 6.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.900
It hit the beach,
moved inland

09:06.960 --> 09:08.200
and destroyed
your town.

09:08.260 --> 09:09.370
Dammit..

09:09.430 --> 09:10.410
How did you know
I was going to

09:10.470 --> 09:11.640
pull a
beach condo complex?

09:11.700 --> 09:12.910
'Cause you're predictable.

09:12.970 --> 09:13.840
Fine. You win.

09:13.900 --> 09:14.900
The bathroom is yours.

09:14.970 --> 09:16.750
We were doing
that for the bathroom.

09:16.810 --> 09:17.810
Shake,
you need to learn how

09:17.870 --> 09:18.940
to play fair.

09:19.010 --> 09:19.920
You don't get
anywhere in life

09:19.980 --> 09:20.820
by cheating.

09:20.880 --> 09:21.790
You haven't
gotten anywhere

09:21.840 --> 09:22.690
in life either.

09:22.740 --> 09:23.880
So what
does that say?

09:23.950 --> 09:26.720
Take it back,
you stinkin' butt hole.

09:26.780 --> 09:28.460
Wait, what are you doing?

09:28.520 --> 09:29.690
Fill it with spiders.

09:29.750 --> 09:30.820
No!

09:30.890 --> 09:32.060
See, now I'm playing fair,
Shake!

09:33.020 --> 09:34.800
Look-
I'm getting ahead in life!

09:34.860 --> 09:37.200
No no! Hey guys, I found my spiders.

09:38.190 --> 09:39.400
Rabbot!

09:39.460 --> 09:41.600
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,

09:41.660 --> 09:44.470
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Saturday...

09:44.530 --> 09:46.240
What's this?

09:46.300 --> 09:47.710
It's a bottle
of Pinot Grig.

09:47.770 --> 09:49.340
It's a
card here too.

09:49.400 --> 09:50.940
Welcome to
the neighborhood.

09:51.010 --> 09:52.010
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,

09:52.070 --> 09:53.480
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,

09:53.540 --> 09:54.380
Saturday.

09:54.440 --> 09:55.920
What a wonderful gesture...

09:55.980 --> 09:59.220
Oh!
Oh, whoa...

09:59.280 --> 10:01.230
That's a bad gesture.

10:01.280 --> 10:05.160
I don't understand
a damn thang ya'll doin'.

10:05.220 --> 10:07.500
I know you
guys aren't, but

10:07.560 --> 10:09.300
I'm actually
kinda glad he came

10:09.360 --> 10:10.600
along.

10:10.660 --> 10:11.870
I was about
to black out.

10:11.930 --> 10:12.910
When it's gonna

10:12.960 --> 10:14.910
magically form
back into a house

10:14.960 --> 10:15.940
again?

10:16.000 --> 10:17.440
Yeah, you remember that
place we use to live?

10:17.500 --> 10:19.170
It used to do
that all the time.

10:19.230 --> 10:20.410
I keep waiting.

10:20.470 --> 10:21.380
It ain't happening.

10:21.440 --> 10:24.140
Where the hell
we gonna live?

10:24.210 --> 10:26.550
Alright!
Check it out, ya'll.

10:26.610 --> 10:28.420
Our new home!

10:28.480 --> 10:29.620
Someday we'll
have children that

10:29.680 --> 10:30.950
will veg right in front of

10:31.010 --> 10:33.390
the TV just like us,
and they will

10:33.450 --> 10:35.360
work a job to
bring home money

10:35.420 --> 10:37.560
so that I may
live in a style to

10:37.620 --> 10:39.660
which I
am accustomed!

10:39.720 --> 10:43.000
Meatwad, fetch the
fertility drugs.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.400
Looks like the
Aqua Teens are

10:44.460 --> 10:45.460

10:45.530 --> 10:46.900
