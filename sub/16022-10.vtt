00:09.075 --> 00:10.275
Where's russell?

00:10.277 --> 00:11.276
He's in layout.
Okay.

00:11.278 --> 00:13.345
What's going on?
Russell?

00:13.347 --> 00:15.481
Russell.

00:15.483 --> 00:18.017
It's sara.
There's been a shooting.
How bad is it?

00:18.019 --> 00:20.352
I-I don't know.
Her cell phone cut out.
What about finn?

00:20.354 --> 00:22.087
I can't reach her either.
Listen to me,

00:22.089 --> 00:24.356
I want you to call
the sheriff's office
in larkston.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.325
Find out if they know
anything about the shooting.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.394
(phone keypad blipping)
go.

00:30.563 --> 00:32.231
Jim, it's db.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.632
I need a chopper.

00:45.311 --> 00:47.446
Deputy's dead.

00:47.448 --> 00:50.516
Sheriff's still alive.

00:50.518 --> 00:54.053
It's been a rough 48 hours.
You all right?

00:54.055 --> 00:55.054
I'm okay.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.321
Bullet just grazed me.

00:56.323 --> 00:58.223
What about finn--
do you know where she is?

00:58.225 --> 01:01.193
No, I don't know.
She's not picking up her cell.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.662
What if he went after her?

01:03.664 --> 01:05.497
Well...

01:05.499 --> 01:07.166
We gotta find her.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.142
(panting)

01:23.083 --> 01:24.349
Hey!

01:25.318 --> 01:28.387
Hey! Come on! Stop!

01:29.622 --> 01:30.823

01:45.472 --> 01:46.705

tires screeching)

02:35.489 --> 02:37.523
Down in the sheriff's

02:37.525 --> 02:39.691
Yeah, yeah, I'll go over there

02:39.693 --> 02:41.627
No, no, listen

02:41.629 --> 02:43.262
There are gonna be
a lot of questions

02:43.264 --> 02:44.563
About what happened
the last couple of days.

02:44.565 --> 02:47.399
Sara, I need you to talk
to brass now-- please.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.935
Nick and I are

Come here, let me...

02:56.877 --> 02:59.478
I'm so glad you're okay.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.780
Thank you.
Yeah.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.449
Uh, who's in charge
here, please?

03:04.451 --> 03:07.252
I... I-I guess that would be me.

03:07.254 --> 03:08.787
Yeah.
Uh, maxine lennox.

03:08.789 --> 03:12.357
Deputy lennox, I'm csi
supervisor russell.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.792
One of my csis is missing.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.461
She was investigating
a case up here.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.463
Her name's
julie finlay.
Yes.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.332
I saw her a few hours ago
at the motel.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.935
She said she was
following up on a lead.

03:22.937 --> 03:24.403
Did she say where
she was going?

03:24.405 --> 03:26.872
No.
I need you to
put a broadcast out

03:26.874 --> 03:29.374
On your car, right now.
Yes, sir.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.243
Have a seat.
We'll be right with you.

03:32.478 --> 03:34.446
Brass: I got you this;
I thought you could use it.

03:34.448 --> 03:35.480
Thank you.

03:35.482 --> 03:36.715
How you holding up?

03:36.717 --> 03:39.284
It's been a long couple of days.

03:39.286 --> 03:42.654
Well, uh, I know things might
be a little cloudy for you

03:42.656 --> 03:44.389
Right now, but, uh...

03:44.391 --> 03:45.724
You know, we have
to officially

03:45.726 --> 03:49.228
Get a statement to know
what happened up here.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.829
I know the drill.

03:50.831 --> 03:51.863
All right.
(recorder beeps)

03:51.865 --> 03:53.298
Let's start from
the beginning.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.534
What were you and
csis finlay and brody

03:55.536 --> 03:56.835
Doing here in larkston?

03:56.837 --> 04:00.572
Larkston was never
part of the plan.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.008
We just wanted to have
a little fun, I mean...

04:03.010 --> 04:06.511
How often do we all
have the weekend off?

04:09.415 --> 04:12.985
Whew! I am gonna go home,
open a bottle of wine

04:12.987 --> 04:14.786
And watch hepburn
and tracy movies.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.722
Oh, wish
I could do that.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.991
I've got about a month's
worth of laundry to do.

04:18.993 --> 04:20.292
Ugh.

04:20.294 --> 04:21.460
What are you
up to, morgan?

04:21.462 --> 04:23.462
Uh, actually,
I am driving to reno.

04:23.464 --> 04:27.532
My mom got me this gift
certificate for a spa there.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.568
It has all mineral-based
treatments,

04:29.570 --> 04:31.536
So I am getting
the amethyst massage.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.338
It's supposed to calm the nerves

04:33.340 --> 04:34.840
And absorb negative energy.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.675
I could probably use that.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.010
Yeah, me, too.

04:38.012 --> 04:39.578
You guys should join me.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.480
I got a suite.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.514
Got plenty of room.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.049
Oh, I... I mean,

04:44.051 --> 04:45.817
We don't want
to crash your weekend.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.586
Are you kidding?
I would love it.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.321
I hate drinking alone.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.456
Massages, alcohol...?

04:51.458 --> 04:52.491
I'm in.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.860
I'm in.
(finn laughs)

04:54.862 --> 04:56.828
Awesome! Okay... Um,
let's go home, change,

04:56.830 --> 04:58.463
And I'll meet you
back here in an hour.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.065
Okay.
Okay.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.933
Brass:
<i>But you never made it to reno.</i>

05:01.935 --> 05:03.635
Why not?

05:03.637 --> 05:05.404
Finn said that
if we took her car,

05:05.406 --> 05:07.039
We could make it there
in half the time.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.474
That turned out to be a mistake.

05:09.476 --> 05:13.478
♪

05:36.703 --> 05:38.337
Man:
Yeah, she's a beauty.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.539
You got the 440 in there?
Yeah.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.607
And the four
barrel carb.
(chuckles)

05:42.609 --> 05:44.443
That's a lot of power.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.610
Oh, I think I can handle it.

05:45.612 --> 05:47.079
(wry laugh)

05:48.114 --> 05:50.649
So, darryl, uh,
what's the bottom line?

05:50.651 --> 05:52.784
Can you fix it?
Uh, yeah, it's just
a broken water pump.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.953
I can replace it
in about an hour.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.956
Now, if, uh... I order
the part tonight,

05:57.958 --> 05:59.791
I should have it
by noon tomorrow.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.626
(groans)

06:01.628 --> 06:04.062
So much for our moonlit
salt scrubs.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.498
I can give you ladies
a lift into larkston.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.867
We don't have a spa,
but we do have a nice motel.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.903
Plus it's karaoke night
at the cactus.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.440
Awesome.
(finn laughs)

06:15.442 --> 06:16.608
Brody:
Come on.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.677
Have a drink,
some food, it'll be fun.

couple shots of tequila

07:13.767 --> 07:15.100
And you turn into
janis joplin.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.836
Yeah, I think you
missed your calling.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.439
Like, awesome! Wow!
Thanks.
Yeah, uh, well,

07:20.441 --> 07:21.673
I was a double major
in college.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.442
Chemistry and voice.
Chose chemistry.

07:23.444 --> 07:26.511
But I was the front woman for
a band at the roxy for a year.

07:26.513 --> 07:29.214
I can't believe we didn't
know this about you.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.652
I didn't know you were
into mechanics.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.054
Yeah, you and,
um, darryl...

07:36.056 --> 07:38.023
Seem to be enjoying
each other's company tonight

07:38.025 --> 07:40.759
He's very nice.
He's, uh, he's actually smart.

07:40.761 --> 07:41.760
Brody:
Oh.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.829
(laughs)

07:45.631 --> 07:47.666
He's, uh, he's funny.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.701
Knows a lot about cars.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.703
Oh. It's too bad
he's so unattractive.

07:51.705 --> 07:54.039
(laughs)

07:54.041 --> 07:55.807
This round's on darryl.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.709
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.

07:57.711 --> 07:58.944
Brody:
Thank <i>you.</i>

07:58.946 --> 08:01.780
All right, here's
to our girls' weekend.

08:01.782 --> 08:02.747
Yes.

08:02.749 --> 08:04.649
(whooping)

08:04.651 --> 08:05.784
(laughs)

08:08.888 --> 08:11.656
Oh, god. Aah.
Whee.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.859
(finn laughs)
brody: Whoo!

08:13.861 --> 08:16.962
All right, so I'm gonna,
um, go back to the motel.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.597
No, I-I put in
a beyoncé song,

08:18.599 --> 08:20.031
I want us all to
sing it together.

08:20.033 --> 08:20.799
I'll come with you.

08:20.801 --> 08:21.800
Hey.
No, stay.

08:21.802 --> 08:22.968
Stay, have fun.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.070
Darryl's gonna walk me home.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.706
We need to finish
the conversation.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.507
Uh-huh.

08:28.509 --> 08:30.609
Of course you do.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.911
See you guys later.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.180
Okay. Have fun.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.748
Brody:
Yeah, right.

08:38.050 --> 08:39.117
Who's beyoncé?

08:45.258 --> 08:48.660
The stars are really
beautiful out here.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.262
There's so many lights
in vegas, you know,

08:50.264 --> 08:52.097
You never
get to see them.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.900
Yeah, I guess I don't
really notice them anymore.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.268
Born and raised here.

08:56.270 --> 08:59.571
I guess I kind of
take them for granted.

09:01.173 --> 09:02.774
Was it great growing up here?

09:02.776 --> 09:03.775
Yeah, it was great.

09:03.777 --> 09:04.876
Was it?
It was real great.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.578
Must have been.
Mm-hmm.

09:17.256 --> 09:18.256
(finlay laughs)

09:18.258 --> 09:20.992
Oh... Yeah.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.827
Oops. (chuckles)

09:22.829 --> 09:25.063
You have something
in your pocket.

09:25.065 --> 09:29.334
You mean, um...

09:29.336 --> 09:30.702
You mean this.

09:30.704 --> 09:31.703
Mm-hmm.

09:31.705 --> 09:34.005
You got me.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.575
I'm not really
into married men.

09:36.577 --> 09:37.943
Or liars.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.112
I'm not lying anymore.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.647
You're still married.

09:42.649 --> 09:45.951
Not happily.

09:47.987 --> 09:50.355
Good night.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.723
(grunts quietly)

09:54.760 --> 09:55.894
Night?

09:58.297 --> 10:01.132
You're a little tease,
you know that?

10:01.134 --> 10:02.867
Darryl, don't do this.

10:02.869 --> 10:05.170
You think you can
just lead me on

10:05.172 --> 10:07.739
All night and then
just walk away?

10:07.741 --> 10:09.874
Don't do this.
(grunts)

10:11.010 --> 10:12.811
(gasps)

10:12.813 --> 10:13.945
I don't want to hurt you.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.347
But I will.

10:16.983 --> 10:19.918
(grunting)

10:25.691 --> 10:27.359
(panting)

10:29.762 --> 10:31.363
You're dead.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.776
(sara speaks quietly)

10:48.347 --> 10:49.648
What happened?

10:49.650 --> 10:50.749
Oh, my god,

10:50.751 --> 10:54.052
Brody: What are you
talking about?
Finn: He attacked me.

10:54.054 --> 10:56.755
What?
I think he's dead.

10:57.356 --> 10:58.890
Darlene, call the sheriff.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.725
Finn, what happened?

11:00.727 --> 11:03.194
I don't know.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.897
Okay, we got to get you to
a hospital-- you need stitches.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.198
I don't want to go
to the hospital.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.900
Where's darryl?

11:08.902 --> 11:11.970
He's-he's over here.
Show us.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.708
(panting)

11:23.082 --> 11:25.216
His body was right here.

11:25.218 --> 11:28.086
Where'd it go?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.993
How many times
did you stab him?
I stabbed him twice.

11:34.995 --> 11:39.464
Uh, I-I-I dropped it
beside the body.

11:39.466 --> 11:40.999
Maybe you didn't kill him, finn.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.400
Maybe he's not dead.
Did you take

11:42.402 --> 11:45.336
His pulse?
No, no, I wanted to get away.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.472
I-I'm sure he was not moving.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.174
It's okay. All right?

11:49.176 --> 11:50.842
It's gonna be all right.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.977
All right.

11:52.979 --> 11:56.047
They're not flags,
but they'll have to do.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.716
Really hard to tell
how much blood he lost.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.051
It seeped into
the dirt.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.754
There are blood drops moving
away from the blood pool.

12:04.790 --> 12:08.393
Hey, finn, was darryl
wearing cowboy boots?

12:08.395 --> 12:10.161
Yeah.

12:11.998 --> 12:16.935
(siren wailing in distance)
and corresponding
blood drops.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.337
He was on his feet
and bleeding.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.339
Ah, I didn't kill him.
He walked away.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.508
Sidle: There's a second set
of prints, so...

12:23.510 --> 12:25.310
Not by himself.
Somebody helped him.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.277
Brody:
Into a car.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.012
Blood drops end...

12:28.014 --> 12:29.848
Where these tire tracks begin.

12:33.185 --> 12:35.453
(siren stops)

12:40.460 --> 12:43.161
You're doing?
It's all right.

12:43.163 --> 12:46.364
Sheriff, we're law enforcement--
las vegas csis

12:46.366 --> 12:48.199
Sidle, finlay and brody.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.034
Las vegas crime lab?!

12:50.036 --> 12:52.403
I didn't call you
to work this scene.

12:52.405 --> 12:56.307
Our friend here
was attacked.
I got a phone call

12:56.309 --> 12:58.042
Saying you killed him.

12:58.044 --> 13:01.179
Well, the evidence shows
that darryl is still alive.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.413
Evidence?

13:02.415 --> 13:04.249
Thought you said you weren't
working the scene.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.784
We're not working
the scene.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.418
We just made a couple
of observations.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.487
Uh-huh.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.489
Yeah.

13:11.491 --> 13:14.492
Yeah, I'm making a few
of those myself.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.561
Three girls; been drinking...

13:16.563 --> 13:19.464
One bleeding...
Messing around

13:19.466 --> 13:22.066
In a crime scene
you got no business being in.

13:22.068 --> 13:24.903
We're not
messing around.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.838
How do I know
you didn't kill him?

13:26.840 --> 13:29.507
Dumped his body
somewhere.

13:31.076 --> 13:32.343
Now you're tampering
with the evidence.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.045
Mm-hmm.

13:38.884 --> 13:40.485
So he just released you?
No.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.353
No. His deputies
separated morgan and I,

13:42.355 --> 13:44.956
And, uh, they interrogated us
inside the bar.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.257
What about finn?
Sheriff put her

13:46.259 --> 13:47.559
Under house arrest in the motel.

13:47.561 --> 13:49.093
Finn said that he grilled her

13:49.095 --> 13:51.396
While the local doctor
stitched her up.

13:51.398 --> 13:55.333
So you're saying
the knife...

13:55.335 --> 13:56.868
Was darryl's?

13:56.870 --> 13:58.036
Yes.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.470
How'd it end up
in your hands?

13:59.472 --> 14:00.471
I told you:

14:00.473 --> 14:02.340
He pulled the knife,

14:02.342 --> 14:03.541
He tried to rape me,

14:03.543 --> 14:05.376
I grabbed the knife

14:05.378 --> 14:07.445
And I fought back.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.380
Oh.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.182
Look at these bruises, sheriff.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.951
Consistent with
a struggle.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.552
Hmm.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.554
So you stabbed him
in self-defense

14:16.556 --> 14:18.857
And in that few minutes,
while you were inside the bar

14:18.859 --> 14:20.525
Telling your friends,

14:20.527 --> 14:22.527
Someone took darryl
and the knife.
Yes.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.462
And he is out there,
and I-I think

14:24.464 --> 14:27.398
You should be out there
looking for him.
Oh, I got deputies

14:27.400 --> 14:29.901
Going to his house
and his auto shop.

14:29.903 --> 14:32.570
But, frankly...
(grunts)

14:32.572 --> 14:36.541
You could save us
all a lot of time.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.543
Just tell us the truth.

14:40.946 --> 14:44.115
I am telling you the truth.

14:44.117 --> 14:47.919
I am a csi, and I deserve
the benefit of the doubt.

14:47.921 --> 14:51.289
I've known darryl walsh
for 15 years.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.458
I play poker with him
every other Thursday.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.928
It just doesn't seem
like something he'd do.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.530
Ms. Finlay didn't inflict
these wounds herself.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.300
Come on, owen,
she's been through enough.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.402
Do you really have to keep her
locked up here like a prisoner?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.137
Until I figure out what
happened to darryl...

15:06.139 --> 15:09.107
She's not going anywhere.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.977
You do your job, marty;
I'll do mine.

15:15.514 --> 15:17.148
Marty:
All done.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.918
You're gonna be just fine.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.586
(voice breaking):
Thanks.

15:24.456 --> 15:26.024
(phone ringing)

15:26.026 --> 15:27.358
Any sign of finn?

15:27.360 --> 15:29.494
No.

15:29.496 --> 15:30.929
Russell just texted.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.597
They're still following up
on leads.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.199
So, csi brody took
photographs of the crime scene

15:35.201 --> 15:38.169
Which you believe prove that
darryl walsh was still alive.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.104
Now, did you share those
photos with the deputies

15:40.106 --> 15:41.639
Who questioned you?
Yes. Of course.

15:41.641 --> 15:45.243
We were legally obligated
to turn 'em over.

15:45.245 --> 15:49.547
But morgan didn't delete them
from her cell phone, did she?

16:02.161 --> 16:03.728
(computer blipping)

16:06.365 --> 16:07.732
(computer beeping)

16:10.602 --> 16:11.569
(auto-dial beeping)

16:11.571 --> 16:13.271
(line ringing)

16:13.273 --> 16:15.740
Hey, greg.
Hey. That, uh, tire track photo

16:15.742 --> 16:19.010
That you guys sent me from the
crime scene, I ran it through

16:19.012 --> 16:21.112
Treadfind--
tire was manufactured

16:21.114 --> 16:24.549
By bridgman wheels in 2008.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.584
What kind of car?
A truck, actually.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.654
Primarily the ford ranger
and f-150.

16:29.656 --> 16:33.024
I pulled dmv records.
Sending you a list

16:33.026 --> 16:34.692
Of everyone in larkston

16:34.694 --> 16:35.994
Who owns that vehicle.

16:35.996 --> 16:39.063
Pulling it up now. Thank you.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.200
Hey, sheriff?
Yeah.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.534
According to dmv records,

16:43.536 --> 16:46.671
There's over 30 vehicles
in this town with tires

16:46.673 --> 16:49.741
That match the tracks that
we found at the crime scene.

16:51.343 --> 16:52.577
Well, the last I checked,

16:52.579 --> 16:54.545
You weren't part of
this investigation.

16:54.547 --> 16:55.780
Brody: Sheriff,
evidence shows

16:55.782 --> 16:57.548
That somebody helped
darryl walsh

16:57.550 --> 17:00.485
Into a truck. We find the truck,
maybe we find darryl.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.186
It exonerates csi finlay.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.521
You really think
he's still alive?

17:03.523 --> 17:04.589
There were
no drag marks.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.257
Boot prints
and blood drops show

17:06.259 --> 17:08.726
That he was upright and moving
when he got into the truck.

17:08.728 --> 17:09.660
Brody: You've searched his home,
you've searched his work.

17:09.662 --> 17:13.297
This list is the closest thing
we have to a lead.

17:13.299 --> 17:15.166
All we're asking is
that you take a look at it.

17:15.168 --> 17:17.068
Is there anyone
on here that might

17:17.070 --> 17:19.237
Put themselves on the line
for darryl?

17:19.239 --> 17:21.672
(sighs)
all right.

17:27.179 --> 17:28.579
Valerie irvin, darryl's wife.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.616
Great. Let's go talk to her.
We can't.

17:31.618 --> 17:34.185
She left for vegas
this morning.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.354
Brody:
I'll call greg right away.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.756
<i>Have him bring her in</i>
<i>for questioning.</i>

17:39.725 --> 17:41.459
You don't seem
too worried

17:41.461 --> 17:43.327
About your husband, mrs. Irvin.

17:43.329 --> 17:44.629
I mean, darryl was stabbed.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.097
Now he's missing.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.432
And you're playing slots

17:47.434 --> 17:49.367
In vegas.
Oh, he'll turn up.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.635
He always does.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.603
So he's gone missing before?

17:52.605 --> 17:54.072
(wry laugh)

17:54.074 --> 17:56.240
We don't really keep tabs
on each other.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.643
Darryl does his thing,

17:58.645 --> 18:03.448
Uh, last night, after darryl
was stabbed, back in larkston,

18:03.450 --> 18:05.716
Somebody picked him up
from the motel.

18:05.718 --> 18:09.687
I was working all night
at the diner, 6:00 to 6:00.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.622
I drove straight here
after my shift.

18:12.591 --> 18:16.661
Uh, we searched your truck.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.262
Found this...

18:18.264 --> 18:20.698
Stuck to the floor mat.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.768
What is that?

18:23.770 --> 18:25.670
Sidle:
<i>It was a high resin leaf,</i>

18:25.672 --> 18:28.806
Along with expanded
clay pebbles.

18:28.808 --> 18:33.377
I get it-- so darryl was
running a hydroponic

18:33.379 --> 18:36.581
Pot-growing operation
under the radar.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.449
Thing about hydroponics--

18:38.451 --> 18:40.451
It requires a lot of energy.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.686
Hodges: I pulled up
the electrical grid

18:41.688 --> 18:42.854
Of the town of larkston.

18:42.856 --> 18:45.423
The blue dots
represent average

18:45.425 --> 18:49.127
Household electrical use
per month, about 900 kilowatts.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.128
Well, they're all blue dots.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.629
A grow house would use at least

18:51.631 --> 18:52.797
Five times that much power.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.266
Now, step back in time with me

18:55.268 --> 18:57.268
As we follow the "current"

18:57.270 --> 18:58.503
Back to the past.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.771
This is a time lapse reversal
of the town's

19:00.773 --> 19:02.740
Electrical use
over the past year.

19:02.742 --> 19:06.811
There's your red dot-- indicates
usage of over 5,000 kilowatts

19:06.813 --> 19:08.679
A month for
four months.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.481
Goes back to normal for a month

19:10.483 --> 19:11.716
And then spikes again
for another

19:11.718 --> 19:13.384
Four months.
Sanders: Typical growth

19:13.386 --> 19:14.785
And harvest cycle
for marijuana.

19:14.787 --> 19:17.855
Four months to grow,
one month to dry.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.891
And only minutes to enjoy it.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.327
So I've heard.

19:23.329 --> 19:24.795
So what is that,
a house?

19:24.797 --> 19:28.199
Well, according to
the satellite image,

19:28.201 --> 19:30.535
It's a dilapidated barn,
registered

19:30.537 --> 19:32.436
To edith skinner.

19:32.438 --> 19:34.639
She's 85.

19:43.782 --> 19:46.450
Deputy: Think old lady skinner
has any idea

19:46.452 --> 19:48.519
What darryl and val are doing
in her barn?

19:48.521 --> 19:50.488
Sheriff:
I just talked to her.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.524
Darryl told her he was
storing some cars here.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.859
Put that thing away.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.394
Darryl could be hiding
in here somewhere.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.395
I'm not taking any chances.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.397
Willis, pop the trunk.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.599
He's not the monster
you're making him out to be.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.601
No offense, sheriff,
but I'm not sure you know darryl

20:03.603 --> 20:04.902
The way you think you do.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.442
Plates are all
from out of state.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.377
Sheriff: Well, darryl could've
bought 'em for spare parts.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.880
Or, in addition
to growing pot,

20:15.882 --> 20:18.316
He's running a chop shop.

20:21.954 --> 20:24.655
No sign of him.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.501
(groans)

20:37.503 --> 20:39.837
Sheriff, deputy,
take a look at this.

20:43.008 --> 20:45.276
Oh, my god.

20:52.618 --> 20:54.652
You still think
your friend's not a monster?

21:01.760 --> 21:03.828
(camera shutter clicking)

21:08.467 --> 21:10.468
All right. Let's do it.

21:23.582 --> 21:25.583
All right.

21:25.585 --> 21:29.287
Blunt force trauma
to the head and face.

21:30.656 --> 21:34.325
Compound fracture
to the right forearm.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.527
It looks like
she was beaten to death.

21:36.529 --> 21:39.397
When I have to put
on my coroner's hat,

21:39.399 --> 21:43.034
Death is usually natural causes
or car accidents.

21:43.036 --> 21:44.969
Don't see violence
like this very often.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.638
Wish we could say
the same.
Yeah.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.641
No identification.

21:52.444 --> 21:55.680
There's a green residue
on the shoes here-- hmm.

21:58.684 --> 22:00.785
Didn't come from the car.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.920
Do you mind
if I collect it?

22:02.922 --> 22:05.323
Not at all.
There's no fresh blood.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.591
There's no evidence
that darryl was here last night.

22:07.593 --> 22:09.493
Wife's alibi checked out.

22:09.495 --> 22:10.661
Val wasn't the one
that picked him up.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.663
Maybe one of his buddies
gave him a ride,

22:12.665 --> 22:17.368
Val said that she had no idea
what darryl was doing up here.

22:17.370 --> 22:19.003
Said that he borrows
her truck all the time.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.639
It could explain
the pebbles and the cannabis.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.574
I'll run the license and
registration on these vehicles.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.476
See if we can figure out
who they belong to.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.645
Thanks.
Uh, sheriff...

22:27.647 --> 22:30.514
I would really like csi finlay
to help us out on the case.

22:30.516 --> 22:31.949
There's no reason

22:31.951 --> 22:33.551
To keep her locked up
in that motel room.

22:33.553 --> 22:34.985
She still stabbed darryl.

22:34.987 --> 22:37.922
But she had nothing to do
with this crime scene,

22:37.924 --> 22:39.790
And frankly...

22:39.792 --> 22:41.726
We could really use her help.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.528
Fine.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.697
I'll lift the house arrest,
but she's not leaving town.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.766
One more thing...

22:49.735 --> 22:51.635
Anyone ever tell
you you're pushy?

22:51.637 --> 22:52.837
(wry laugh)

22:52.839 --> 22:55.506
I just need dna samples
from everyone here,

22:55.508 --> 22:58.409
What, you think one of us had
something to do with this?

22:58.411 --> 23:00.678
Just procedure.

23:02.981 --> 23:04.615
Brass:
<i>Then what happened?</i>

23:04.617 --> 23:06.851
Sidle:
<i>Morgan took those samples</i>
<i>back to the lab.</i>

23:06.853 --> 23:09.587
What about the body-- did
dr. Kinney do the autopsy?

23:09.589 --> 23:13.657
Because of his limited
experience in forensic
pathology,

23:13.659 --> 23:15.659
Morgan took the body
back to vegas as well.

23:15.661 --> 23:18.062
She handed it off
to david phillips.

23:22.033 --> 23:24.835
So, let me get
this straight.

23:24.837 --> 23:28.906
Finn, morgan and sara go away
for a nice fun weekend,

23:28.908 --> 23:30.775
Finn is then attacked,

23:30.777 --> 23:32.643
Accused of murder

23:32.645 --> 23:34.712
And sara finds a body?

23:34.714 --> 23:36.180
Yeah.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.549
Not the relaxing weekend
they were hoping for.

23:38.551 --> 23:41.986
Hey, david, there's a 419
at the mediterranean.

23:41.988 --> 23:44.789
I'm on it.

23:47.692 --> 23:49.927
Sanders:
Pumpkins painted on her nails.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.462
Must've liked Halloween.

23:51.464 --> 23:53.531
That could be
when she went missing.

23:53.533 --> 23:54.865
I'll rehydrate
her fingertip,

23:54.867 --> 23:56.534
See if we can get an I.D.

23:56.536 --> 23:57.735
Based on the temperature
of the building

23:57.737 --> 24:00.070
And the condition
of the body,

24:00.072 --> 24:02.873
I'd say she's been dead
less than a month.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.710
Sanders:
These look like ligature marks.

24:06.712 --> 24:10.014
Killer could've used
a string to tie her up.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.649
Maybe wire.

24:11.651 --> 24:13.684
Restrained and beaten.

24:13.686 --> 24:15.753
Circular size and
shape tell me

24:15.755 --> 24:17.087
She was hit repeatedly
with a hammer.

24:17.089 --> 24:19.590
Any idea how old she was?

24:19.592 --> 24:22.993
Wisdom teeth are present,
so she's over 18.

24:24.196 --> 24:26.630
And there's something
in her teeth.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.065
Could you hold that?

24:37.609 --> 24:39.510
Looks like a pubic hair.

24:39.512 --> 24:42.713
Suggests sexual activity
close to the time of death.

24:42.715 --> 24:44.715
Robbins: Considering that
she was restrained,

24:44.717 --> 24:46.717
I'm betting the sex
wasn't consensual.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.886
I'll collect an sae kit.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.855
Follicle is still attached.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.022
Should be able to get dna.

24:52.024 --> 24:54.592
Might help us
identify her killer.

24:57.863 --> 25:00.064
Russell (over phone):
What did you find out?

25:00.066 --> 25:01.799
Finlay: Victim's name
is brenda whittaker.

25:01.801 --> 25:04.768
She is a 23-year-old
from san diego.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.904
Disappeared four months ago.

25:06.906 --> 25:09.707
Cross-referenced her driver's
license and registration

25:09.709 --> 25:11.609
And prints confirmed it was her.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.744
Held against her will and raped.

25:13.746 --> 25:17.081
Spermatozoa was found in the
oral, anal and vaginal samples

25:17.083 --> 25:18.816
Collected from the victim.

25:18.818 --> 25:20.518
Still waiting on the dna.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.286
Which will prove
darryl's a murderer.

25:22.288 --> 25:23.954
Can't believe
he's still out there.

25:23.956 --> 25:26.724
Which is why you better
watch your back.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.859
Tell me about the other cars
in the barn.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.995
They belong to two other
missing women.

25:30.997 --> 25:34.064
A 19-year-old college student
from sedona

25:34.066 --> 25:37.902
And a 28-year-old waitress
from salt lake city--

25:37.904 --> 25:40.938
Both missing for over a year
and both traveling alone.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.973
Darryl's a mechanic, right?

25:42.975 --> 25:46.710
Yeah, he operates a gas station
and a garage.

25:46.712 --> 25:51.815
So maybe these women had
car trouble, stopped for gas.

25:51.817 --> 25:53.751
Just happened
to be darryl's type.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.953
He seduced them, abducted them,

25:55.955 --> 25:58.822
Raped them,
and probably killed them.

25:58.824 --> 26:02.560
Brenda whittaker
was the only one found.

26:02.562 --> 26:04.728
Darryl must've dumped the other
bodies someplace else.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.697
(phone buzzing)
oh, hey. This is hodges.

26:06.699 --> 26:07.865
I have to go.

26:07.867 --> 26:08.832
Oh, go ahead.

26:08.834 --> 26:11.569
What have you got?

26:11.571 --> 26:13.270
Trace morgan collected
from the victim's shoes--

26:13.272 --> 26:14.738
<i>Pediastrum boryanum.</i>

26:14.740 --> 26:16.040
Algae?

26:16.042 --> 26:19.109
Specifically green algae
found in fresh water.

26:19.111 --> 26:20.711
I did some checking,

26:20.713 --> 26:22.780
And the nearest large body
of fresh water

26:22.782 --> 26:24.882
Is over 150 miles away.

26:24.884 --> 26:26.984
That doesn't make any sense.

26:26.986 --> 26:30.254
Russell:
<i>Finn was here when we spoke</i>
<i>on the phone last night,</i>

26:30.256 --> 26:33.223
So this is the last place
she was seen.

26:33.225 --> 26:34.258
And that was...

26:34.260 --> 26:36.060
A few hours ago.

26:36.062 --> 26:38.963
Well, we know she borrowed
the deputy's car.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.932
Where was she going?

26:41.934 --> 26:43.200
Russell:
She shouldn't have been
going anywhere.

26:43.202 --> 26:44.868
Her laptop's locked.

26:44.870 --> 26:47.304
Any idea what
the password might be?

26:47.306 --> 26:49.273
Um... Bloodgirl.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.210
Nope.

26:53.212 --> 26:55.679
Bloodgirl528?

26:57.282 --> 26:58.649
No, sir.
No.

26:58.651 --> 26:59.750
Oh, I know, I know-- uh...

26:59.752 --> 27:02.119
Try "agnes."

27:02.121 --> 27:03.821
Agnes? Who's that?

27:03.823 --> 27:06.857
Crazy aunt she loved.

27:06.859 --> 27:07.891
(stokes laughs)

27:07.893 --> 27:10.661
Worked. All right.

27:10.663 --> 27:13.697
So, according
to her web history,

27:13.699 --> 27:17.234
She was looking for fresh
bodies of water in the area.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.736
Did she find any?

27:18.738 --> 27:19.970
No, not according to this.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.406
She wrote the name "gary"
next to an ad

27:22.408 --> 27:25.743
For the diamond cactus
bar & grill.

27:25.745 --> 27:27.177
That's the bar they were at
Friday night.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.780
Give them
a little call here.

27:29.782 --> 27:30.914
Uh, hey, there.

27:30.916 --> 27:33.384
Um... Is gary around?

27:33.386 --> 27:35.919
He's on his break?

27:35.921 --> 27:38.389
Okay. Thank you.

27:38.391 --> 27:39.857
He's the bartender.

27:39.859 --> 27:42.826
If I was looking
for information around town,

27:42.828 --> 27:44.795
That'd be the first place
I'd start.

27:44.797 --> 27:46.664
Yeah, let's go talk to him.

27:48.033 --> 27:50.968
Did csi finlay ask you anything
about bodies of water?

27:50.970 --> 27:54.905
She wanted to know if there were
any lakes or streams nearby

27:54.907 --> 27:56.840
That weren't on a map.

27:56.842 --> 27:59.810
Only thing I could think of
was stone rock lake.

27:59.812 --> 28:00.811
Is that a
man-made lake?

28:00.813 --> 28:02.413
Just a hole
in the ground now.

28:02.415 --> 28:03.881
It dried up years ago.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.282
You know,
the algae would still be there.

28:05.284 --> 28:09.319
About 30 miles from here in the
old stone rock lake campground.

28:09.321 --> 28:10.821
Just off stevenson highway.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.823
Thanks, gary.

28:12.825 --> 28:14.858
(sighs)

28:14.860 --> 28:16.160
What do you think?

28:16.162 --> 28:17.861
I'd hate to go running off
in the wrong direction.

28:17.863 --> 28:19.997
Well, I think that
an abandoned campground

28:19.999 --> 28:23.167
Would be a great place for
darryl to hold women hostage.

28:23.169 --> 28:25.869
Be a good place for him
to hide out, too.

28:25.871 --> 28:28.138
Finn's got a two-hour
head start on us.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.908
Let's go find her
before she finds him.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.910
So how'd you end up
in a nasty gunfight?

28:34.012 --> 28:36.914
Deputy willis said
that he got a tip

28:36.916 --> 28:38.749
That darryl's car
had been spotted

28:38.751 --> 28:40.984
On the side of the road,
just off the interstate.

28:40.986 --> 28:43.821
So... I went with the sheriff
to check it out.

28:43.823 --> 28:45.889
(sirens wailing)

28:53.364 --> 28:55.199
(sirens stop)

28:57.168 --> 28:58.736
Darryl!

28:58.738 --> 28:59.903
It's owen!

28:59.905 --> 29:01.805
Get out of the vehicle!

29:01.807 --> 29:03.040
We're armed, darryl!

29:03.042 --> 29:05.976
Come on, show us your hands!

29:20.859 --> 29:22.359
He's not here.

29:24.028 --> 29:26.930
Is that bus stop still active?

29:26.932 --> 29:29.032
Yes, it is.

29:29.034 --> 29:32.503
Reno. But from there,
he could've hopped a plane.

29:32.505 --> 29:34.404
(phone ringing)
he could be
anywhere by now.

29:34.406 --> 29:35.873
Get on the radio
and find out

29:35.875 --> 29:37.775
When the last
bus came through here.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.943
Hey, henry, what's up?

29:40.979 --> 29:42.946
Are you sure?

29:42.948 --> 29:45.415
Okay. Thanks.

29:45.417 --> 29:49.319
I need a bus schedule from
larkston to reno, please.

29:55.026 --> 29:55.959
What the hell are you doing?

29:55.961 --> 29:57.227
Drop your weapons.

30:04.068 --> 30:06.870
Sheriff, step away
from deputy willis.

30:06.872 --> 30:08.539
Sheriff...
I'm not going anywhere

30:08.541 --> 30:10.541
Until you tell me what
the hell's going on.

30:10.543 --> 30:12.409
Got dna results
on semen recovered

30:12.411 --> 30:14.311
From the woman's body
in the barn.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.246
There were two male
contributors.

30:16.248 --> 30:18.248
You telling me there
was two men involved
in that woman's death?

30:18.250 --> 30:21.285
Darryl walsh
and deputy simon willis.

30:21.287 --> 30:23.153
What? That's crazy.

30:23.155 --> 30:24.588
Ms. Sidle, there's got to
be some kind of mistake.

30:24.590 --> 30:27.057
My colleague compared
the samples of the dna

30:27.059 --> 30:30.561
That I got off of you and your
deputies at the crime scene.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.162
No mistake.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.431
Simon...

30:34.433 --> 30:36.033
Did you have anything to do
with that woman's death?

30:36.035 --> 30:38.435
No. Owen, come on,
you know me.

30:44.342 --> 30:46.443
Why don't you...

30:46.445 --> 30:50.147
Why don't you put
the gun down,

30:50.149 --> 30:52.082
We'll talk about it.

30:55.386 --> 30:57.354
Okay.

31:06.998 --> 31:09.066
Brass: <i>You're lucky</i>
<i>it was just a graze.</i>

31:09.068 --> 31:11.468
Yeah.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.303
I managed to get
a call through to morgan

31:13.305 --> 31:15.305
And...

31:15.307 --> 31:17.307
Shortly after that,
help arrived.

31:17.309 --> 31:20.143
You know, you saved
sheriff gardner's life.

31:20.145 --> 31:22.446
I got a message that
he's out of surgery.

31:22.448 --> 31:25.449
His version of the
facts matches yours.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.984
So, we're done?

31:26.986 --> 31:28.385
I'll just file a
report with the iab,

31:28.387 --> 31:29.519
They'll make their
determination,

31:29.521 --> 31:31.521
But I wouldn't sweat it.

31:32.490 --> 31:34.524
Thank you for coming.

31:34.526 --> 31:37.027
You're welcome.
Of course.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.231
Oh, hey, sara?

31:41.233 --> 31:42.633
Yeah?

31:42.635 --> 31:44.167
Let me know
when you hear about finn.

31:44.169 --> 31:46.103
I will.

32:00.451 --> 32:01.451
(stokes cocks gun)

32:14.532 --> 32:15.933
Russell:
Plate's a match.

32:15.935 --> 32:18.135
Match deputy lennox's car,

32:18.137 --> 32:19.670
So finn's got to be
around here.

32:20.438 --> 32:22.272
The keys are in it.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.441
She must've had car trouble.

32:30.348 --> 32:32.182
Hey...

32:32.184 --> 32:34.017
Coil wires have been cut.

32:34.019 --> 32:37.988
Darryl wanted to make sure
she couldn't leave.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.423
(closes hood)

32:39.425 --> 32:41.458
Nick... I got blood in the car.

32:41.460 --> 32:42.693
Okay.

32:42.695 --> 32:44.194
Let's go.

32:56.507 --> 32:59.109
(whispers):
Take the right.

33:04.415 --> 33:05.549
Finn?

33:05.551 --> 33:07.684
I got a body
over here, man.

33:15.593 --> 33:17.227
It's darryl walsh.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.628
Shot in the chest.

33:21.432 --> 33:23.433
He's dead as a doornail.

33:23.435 --> 33:25.569
All right, so...

33:25.571 --> 33:29.006
Finn's not dead,
then where the hell is she?

33:29.008 --> 33:31.041
Obviously,
this is where...

33:31.043 --> 33:33.777
He kept the girls.

33:33.779 --> 33:36.079
Yeah.

33:36.081 --> 33:38.382
So what do we got here?

33:46.324 --> 33:49.359
(exhales)
got a fully loaded rape kit.

33:51.462 --> 33:53.230
Stokes:
Three shells.

33:56.667 --> 33:58.668
.380 casing--
same as finn.

34:05.343 --> 34:06.443
(beeps)

34:06.445 --> 34:09.046
It's her cell phone.

34:10.515 --> 34:13.116
All right, let-let's
figure this out.

34:16.287 --> 34:18.121
Stokes:
Well, for starters,

34:18.123 --> 34:20.657
We got an ax handle
with blood all over it.

34:20.659 --> 34:21.758
Russell:
Rape kit's open.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.693
Her cell phone's
right next to it,

34:23.695 --> 34:25.128
So maybe she was trying

34:25.130 --> 34:27.297
To document the
crime scene, right?

34:27.299 --> 34:29.833
Yeah, he disables her car,
he grabs the handle

34:29.835 --> 34:34.137
On his way back inside,
and just... Ambushes her.

34:40.611 --> 34:42.746
And that would
have pissed her off.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.382
Yeah, yeah.
She fought back, for sure.

34:45.384 --> 34:48.685
(finlay grunting, gasping)

34:48.687 --> 34:50.320
(punch thuds)

34:50.322 --> 34:52.722
(finlay shouting)

34:52.724 --> 34:54.458
(grunts)

34:58.563 --> 35:01.164
And there's two bullets
in the wall right here.

35:01.166 --> 35:03.600
So she gets off
three shots--

35:03.602 --> 35:06.736
Two miss, but that
third one, boy...

35:07.672 --> 35:08.772
(groans)

35:08.774 --> 35:10.841
Russell:
<i>Punched a hole in his chest.</i>

35:12.577 --> 35:15.679
Blood pool is still liquid
around the edges, so...

35:15.681 --> 35:17.581
This couldn't have
happened too long ago.

35:17.583 --> 35:20.417
Car's dead;
she's got to be on foot.

35:20.419 --> 35:21.852
After she makes it
through this mess,

35:21.854 --> 35:23.720
She probably made a beeline
for the road.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.889
I need you to stay here
and process this scene.

35:25.891 --> 35:27.724
Finn shot the guy.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.593
We need to do this right.

35:29.595 --> 35:31.161
I'll go look for her.

35:31.163 --> 35:32.729
Okay.

35:36.667 --> 35:38.735

36:09.700 --> 36:11.768

36:13.738 --> 36:15.305
Finn?

36:16.407 --> 36:18.642

36:28.554 --> 36:30.687
Sidle:
We're looking for julie finlay.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.690
Woman: She's right around
the corner.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.892
Sidle: Russell...
How is she?

36:35.894 --> 36:37.827
They were able
to stop the bleeding.

36:37.829 --> 36:40.764
She has a ruptured spleen,

36:40.766 --> 36:42.432
Two broken ribs,
and a concussion.

36:42.434 --> 36:43.800
She's gonna be
okay, though.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.669
Thank god.

36:45.671 --> 36:47.637
The doctors say
that her injuries

36:47.639 --> 36:49.873
Are consistent
with being hit by a car.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.741
I was out on that road.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.977
I didn't see
any skid marks.

36:53.979 --> 36:55.579
This was intentional.

36:55.581 --> 36:57.781
Darryl walsh and deputy willis
are both dead.

36:57.783 --> 36:59.716
Who else could be
behind this?

36:59.718 --> 37:01.384
That's what we're
gonna find out.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.720
Why don't you go ahead
and process her and her clothes.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.923
See what we can find.

Sanders:
So, these bruise lines

37:52.537 --> 37:55.472
Were made by the grill
of the car.

37:56.841 --> 37:59.042
So, this circle, is
that some sort of logo?

37:59.044 --> 38:00.810
I don't know.
Let me see

38:00.812 --> 38:02.879
If I can enhance it.

"mmc"?

38:12.658 --> 38:14.724
What kind of car is that?

38:14.726 --> 38:16.926
That's not a car.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.928
That's a badge of honor.

38:18.930 --> 38:21.798
I-I saw this guy on one of
those antique car shows.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.034
He had this old car,
he drove it for years,

38:24.036 --> 38:25.902
And when he hit
a million miles,

38:25.904 --> 38:30.740
He got an emblem to put
on the grill of his car.

38:32.610 --> 38:34.411
Brody:
"million mile club."

38:34.413 --> 38:35.545
Mmc.

38:35.547 --> 38:37.080
It's very exclusive.

38:39.717 --> 38:42.619
And the town of larkston
has one member.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.534
Hey, doc.

38:58.502 --> 38:59.569
(sighs)

38:59.571 --> 39:01.571
Mind if I join you?

39:02.573 --> 39:04.808
(nervous chuckle)
wh-what's this about?

39:04.810 --> 39:08.411
Well, I saw your car
parked out front.

39:08.413 --> 39:10.413
Looks like it's...

39:10.415 --> 39:12.048
Been in an accident.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.884
Now, that'd be a real shame--
you've been driving that car

39:14.886 --> 39:16.019
For a long time.

39:16.021 --> 39:18.355
You got over a million
miles on it.

39:18.357 --> 39:20.123
You even have that
cool grill badge

39:20.125 --> 39:21.758
To prove it.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.360
Love that thing.

39:23.362 --> 39:26.930
It also made quite an
impression on my friend...

39:26.932 --> 39:29.566
When you hit her
with your car.

39:29.568 --> 39:31.601
(engine revving,
tires screeching)

39:31.603 --> 39:34.871
(thudding)

39:34.873 --> 39:36.573
It was an accident.

39:36.575 --> 39:41.845
You tried to kill csi finlay
to protect your nasty secret.

39:41.847 --> 39:43.847
What nasty secret?

39:43.849 --> 39:45.415
That you're a part
of deputy willis

39:45.417 --> 39:47.083
And darryl walsh's
little rape club.

39:47.085 --> 39:49.085
That's not true.

39:49.087 --> 39:51.988
I found evidence you were in
the cabin in stone rock lake.

39:51.990 --> 39:55.158
I was only there
to stitch up darryl

39:55.160 --> 39:57.160
After csi finlay stabbed him.

39:57.162 --> 39:58.895
Deputy willis forced me.

39:58.897 --> 40:02.065
Did he also force you to
rape brenda whittaker?

40:04.735 --> 40:07.704
Come on. I'm a csi, man,
and a pretty good one.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.807
You don't think I'm gonna find
your dirty, nasty used condoms

40:10.809 --> 40:12.409
In the trash can out front?

40:12.411 --> 40:13.943
Dna was all over them.

40:13.945 --> 40:16.012
(laughs anxiously)

40:18.883 --> 40:21.885
So, I had sex with her.

40:22.987 --> 40:25.889
No. You raped her.

40:25.891 --> 40:27.824
And tying a woman up

40:27.826 --> 40:29.626
Against her will, for months,

40:29.628 --> 40:32.996
And raping her over and
over and over again,

40:32.998 --> 40:35.832
And then, you bash her
head in with a hammer,

40:35.834 --> 40:39.502
And you dump her body
in the hood of her car--

40:39.504 --> 40:41.971
Mm-- I don't think I need
to tell you what that is.

40:41.973 --> 40:45.041
I had nothing to do
with her death.

40:45.043 --> 40:47.710
That was all darryl
and-and deputy willis.

40:47.712 --> 40:49.446
Well, they're gone.

40:49.448 --> 40:52.048
You're the one left
holding the bag now.

40:52.050 --> 40:56.986
So, I know there are at least
two other women missing.

40:56.988 --> 40:58.988
Where are their bodies?

40:58.990 --> 41:01.624
I don't know. I...

41:01.626 --> 41:03.960
Darryl said
they took care of them.

41:05.129 --> 41:10.567
All I did was have sex
with those girls.

41:10.569 --> 41:13.536
I-I never did anything
to hurt them.

41:15.539 --> 41:17.707
What do you think rape is?

41:17.709 --> 41:19.976
Hmm?

41:19.978 --> 41:22.579
You're a sick man, dr. Kinney.

41:22.581 --> 41:24.981
You need some help.

41:24.983 --> 41:27.984
And now you're under arrest.

41:30.521 --> 41:32.155
Lennox:
You heard the man.

41:32.157 --> 41:36.159
Come on, let's go.

41:42.132 --> 41:44.901
(monitor beeping steadily)

41:44.903 --> 41:46.102
Oh... (laughs)

41:46.104 --> 41:49.005
You all right?
Want some more drugs?

41:49.007 --> 41:50.740
I do like the ones I'm on.

41:50.742 --> 41:52.242
(laughs)

41:54.078 --> 41:58.581
Thought we almost lost you
there for a minute, jules.

41:58.583 --> 42:01.050
I already started
interviewing replacements.

42:01.052 --> 42:04.153
Yeah? You think you can
get rid of me that easily?

42:04.155 --> 42:05.655
We could always hope.

42:05.657 --> 42:07.223
Sidle:
Up for more visitors?

42:07.992 --> 42:09.759
Hi.

42:09.761 --> 42:11.060
Russell:
I'll call you tomorrow.

42:11.062 --> 42:12.996
Okay.

42:12.998 --> 42:14.731
So, we never made it
to the spa.

42:14.733 --> 42:16.566
Thought we'd bring it to you.

42:16.568 --> 42:18.034
Thank you.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.303
So what do you want
to do next weekend?
