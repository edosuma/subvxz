WEBVTT

00:07.048 --> 00:08.258
Heavenly Father,
bring Jan back.

00:08.258 --> 00:10.010
Give me another chance
to be her mom again.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.178
<i>The reason Zada and Zethra
have been contacting me</i>

00:12.178 --> 00:13.596
is 'cause they're angry
with you.

00:13.596 --> 00:14.723
They said that?

00:14.723 --> 00:16.391
Now, they may not wait
till you're 16.

00:16.391 --> 00:18.560
They may take Susan
and make her take your place

00:18.560 --> 00:19.477
right now.

00:19.477 --> 00:20.854
- Is Susan there?
<i>- Hi, Jan.</i>

00:20.854 --> 00:22.022
We miss you.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.523
You have the right
to remain silent.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.316
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

00:25.316 --> 00:26.651
in a court of law.

00:26.651 --> 00:27.777
I'm not Jan Broberg.

00:27.777 --> 00:28.862
Try not to go too hard

00:28.862 --> 00:30.530
on your folks
when we get you back.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.949
<i>I know what we said
about weapons in the house.</i>

00:32.949 --> 00:34.034
But Jan did see.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.827
- Was she scared?
- No.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.370
<i>Is there anything
you want to talk about?</i>

00:37.370 --> 00:39.164
I'm not your daughter.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.416
I never was,
and I never will be.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.626
The sooner you learn
to accept that, the better.

00:47.047 --> 00:52.427
<i>♪ Must I travel far and wide ♪</i>

00:52.427 --> 00:56.890
<i>♪ Till I am beside
the someone ♪</i>

00:56.890 --> 01:01.686
<i>♪ Who I can mean ♪</i>

01:01.686 --> 01:04.898
♪ Something to ♪

01:04.898 --> 01:08.193
♪ Where ♪

01:08.193 --> 01:13.907
♪ Where is love? ♪

01:23.291 --> 01:25.710
That was terrific.

01:25.710 --> 01:27.587
Well, thank you.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.382
You are such a doll.

01:30.382 --> 01:33.551
I'm gonna call you Dolly.

01:33.551 --> 01:35.762
<i>They want us to fail, Dolly.</i>

01:35.762 --> 01:38.264
We have to finish our mission
before your 16th birthday.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.600
Otherwise,
it's Susan instead of you.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.822
Is that you on the beach?

01:56.825 --> 01:58.326
It's Susan.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.665
What's she doing there?

02:14.342 --> 02:15.927
It's okay.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.639
I don't mind some quiet.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.933
My new puppy kept me up
half the night.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.533
I hate Bob and Mary Ann
for what they're doing...

02:40.618 --> 02:42.704
Treating me and B
like criminals.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.791
How did they treat you
like a criminal?

02:50.879 --> 02:52.422
B's an adult.

02:52.422 --> 02:55.884
You and he don't have
the same responsibilities.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.266
Yes, we do.

03:07.854 --> 03:11.733
What responsibilities
do you have, Jan?

03:26.623 --> 03:28.750
- Thanks, Bob.
- Thank you.

03:32.253 --> 03:33.672
You'll wanna neaten those up.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.056
So your mom tells me
that you saw the Hansens

03:43.056 --> 03:44.474
at Tasty Treat.

03:45.809 --> 03:48.436
Bet Caroline
and you are very excited

03:48.436 --> 03:50.980
to be starting
driving lessons soon.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.282
Now, I don't know what's
going on in your mind,

04:01.282 --> 04:03.993
but I hope that you know
that I love you

04:03.993 --> 04:06.454
with every fiber of my being.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.170
I know that it's been hard,

04:14.170 --> 04:17.340
but Jani...

04:17.340 --> 04:20.218
you're home,

04:20.218 --> 04:22.012
where you belong.

04:24.139 --> 04:27.434
You need to realize that B,

04:27.434 --> 04:34.065
he's going to prison
for a long, long time.

04:36.651 --> 04:39.738
Well, he'll be out
before I turn 16, right?

04:39.738 --> 04:43.158
He'll be lucky if he gets out
by the time you're 30.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.380
So?

04:57.380 --> 04:58.923
What's it say?

05:00.967 --> 05:02.427
Uh...

05:05.430 --> 05:06.931
"Dearest B"...

05:08.808 --> 05:11.686
"If you knew how lonely I am.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.480
"I try and take
pleasant thoughts of you

05:13.480 --> 05:15.398
"into my dreams every night,

05:15.398 --> 05:18.693
where all of this
is behind us."

05:18.693 --> 05:20.862
<i>I know it's all my fault
that we're in this mess.</i>

05:20.862 --> 05:25.325
<i>But I remember what you said
about Christ suffering.</i>

05:25.325 --> 05:27.160
<i>You are right.</i>

05:27.160 --> 05:29.245
<i>We just have to be brave.</i>

05:29.245 --> 05:32.123
<i>Only, I don't know if I am.</i>

05:32.123 --> 05:34.834
"All I know is I c--"

05:38.630 --> 05:41.132
"I couldn't bear
to be with another man."

05:41.132 --> 05:43.385
<i>I know you'll do
everything you can</i>

05:43.385 --> 05:44.594
<i>to get back to me in time,</i>

05:44.594 --> 05:48.348
<i>but if you don't make it,</i>

05:48.348 --> 05:50.517
<i>I have a plan.</i>

05:53.770 --> 05:57.232
<i>'Cause without you,
I can't live.</i>

06:05.198 --> 06:08.993
<i>Love, your Dolly.</i>

06:08.993 --> 06:10.537
That's beautiful, man.

06:10.537 --> 06:13.331
Yeah. Sure.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.560
Mrs. Broberg,

06:33.560 --> 06:35.478
were you aware
that my client was treated

06:35.478 --> 06:39.024
at a clinic in California
in 1974?

06:40.275 --> 06:41.901
Yes, I--

06:41.901 --> 06:45.655
I knew he had issues
with depression.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.490
That's the word he used.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.159
Wasn't he also being treated

06:49.159 --> 06:52.037
for issues regarding
your daughter, Jan?

06:52.037 --> 06:54.080
You were aware
that the psychological illness

06:54.080 --> 06:56.082
he suffered
caused a fixation on her,

06:56.082 --> 06:57.625
weren't you?

06:57.625 --> 07:00.211
He had a fixation
on our whole family.

07:00.211 --> 07:03.757
Ms. Broberg, are you familiar
with the book, "Lolita"?

07:03.757 --> 07:04.924
You should read it.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.509
You're a dead ringer
for the mother.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.011
What does that mean?

07:08.011 --> 07:09.763
Marty,
you're embarrassing yourself.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.681
Your Honor, he is showing off
for his client

07:11.681 --> 07:13.099
so he doesn't get fired

07:13.099 --> 07:15.643
like all of Mr. Berchtold's
previous attorneys.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.520
Let's just stick
to the questions, please.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.646
Yes, Your Honor.

07:20.273 --> 07:24.694
Mrs. Broberg, can you
honestly tell this court

07:24.694 --> 07:27.489
that you didn't realize
there was something sexual

07:27.489 --> 07:30.450
about the relationship
between my client

07:30.450 --> 07:32.911
and your daughter in 1974?

07:44.255 --> 07:48.802
I guess because
he was constantly feeding me

07:48.802 --> 07:51.763
how he felt about me

07:51.763 --> 07:55.892
that I believed that
there wasn't anything sexual

07:55.892 --> 07:57.852
about his feelings for Jan.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.150
I was an absolute fool,

08:04.150 --> 08:06.152
but it doesn't make
what he did right.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.865
I was a fool.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.452
He is a predator.

08:24.504 --> 08:30.260
Mr. Broberg, isn't it a fact
that Mr. Pincock and the FBI

08:30.260 --> 08:33.388
have told you to paint
a picture for this court

08:33.388 --> 08:37.434
of my client as a powerful,
influential person

08:37.434 --> 08:39.728
who can control people?

08:39.728 --> 08:43.481
I don't need them
to paint a picture for me.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.400
That's who he is.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.327
Please rise.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.665
It is hereby ordered
that the defendant,

09:00.665 --> 09:02.500
Robert Ersol Berchtold,

09:02.500 --> 09:04.544
be acquitted of the charges
set forth

09:04.544 --> 09:07.297
by reason
of mental disease or defect,

09:07.297 --> 09:09.174
excluding responsibility.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.717
The defendant
is hereby committed

09:10.717 --> 09:12.594
to the Department of Health
and Welfare.

09:12.594 --> 09:15.221
It means no jail time.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.226
Congratulations.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.231
So he's not going free?

09:25.231 --> 09:26.274
No.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.068
He might be
in a medical facility

09:28.068 --> 09:30.695
for a very long time,
maybe even longer

09:30.695 --> 09:32.280
than he would have been
in prison.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.365
Well, let's hope so.

09:33.365 --> 09:35.241
Yeah.

09:48.463 --> 09:49.923
Let's go.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.591
Heavenly Father, please let B

09:51.591 --> 09:53.051
<i>get out of the hospital soon.</i>

09:54.386 --> 09:56.221
We're running out of time.

09:56.221 --> 09:57.430
I'm just really--

09:57.430 --> 09:58.807
Jan?

10:02.644 --> 10:05.605
I'm sorry, Caroline.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.649
Are you okay?

10:07.649 --> 10:09.234
I just had a weird dream.

10:13.988 --> 10:17.742
We're so glad you're back.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.328
We all love you so much here.

10:30.672 --> 10:33.967
Mary Ann is with her
right now.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.719
At least she'll look
at her mother,

10:35.719 --> 10:41.391
because he's got her dead set
and brainwashed against me.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.854
I mean, she--
she hardly speaks.

10:45.854 --> 10:49.024
She--she refuses to sleep
in her own room.

10:49.024 --> 10:52.861
She'll only sleep in Susan's,
but she won't--

10:52.861 --> 10:54.195
she won't tell us why.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.448
It's like she's living
in a different world.

10:59.200 --> 11:04.205
She's my child, but she's
a complete mystery to me.

11:04.205 --> 11:07.208
And I--I just...

11:08.960 --> 11:15.300
I wish that she could tell us
what she needs from us.

11:18.887 --> 11:22.807
She needs freedom to grow up.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.726
You can't watch her
every minute.

11:27.645 --> 11:30.982
But it's also important
to keep engaging her,

11:30.982 --> 11:33.276
so when she's ready to talk,

11:33.276 --> 11:36.237
she knows
you'll be there for her.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.996
But what if it's too late?

11:48.625 --> 11:55.090
When we first sat down,
I asked her to draw her family.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.717
There you are.

12:08.853 --> 12:11.272
All under one roof
with her sisters.

12:14.109 --> 12:17.904
It tells me she still sees
her home and family

12:17.904 --> 12:20.907
as a place of belonging.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.201
She even drew the dogs.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.955
She loves the dogs.

12:31.292 --> 12:34.587
She didn't draw herself, though.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.924
No.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.135
She's back here
in Pocatello with us,

12:40.135 --> 12:45.807
but in other ways,
she's not ready to come home.

12:48.768 --> 12:52.564
I hope that with time,

12:52.564 --> 12:55.775
Jan will feel more comfortable

12:55.775 --> 12:59.487
opening up
about her experiences.

12:59.487 --> 13:03.283
She'll, uh...

13:03.283 --> 13:07.078
she'll carry them with her
throughout her life.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.709
But Bob...

13:12.709 --> 13:16.504
there is a path to healing.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.049
Don't give up.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.312
Hm.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.065
Look at him.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.401
Hell, we're doing a good deed.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.196
Sending that pervert a message.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.477
<i>Hi. Brobergs.</i>

14:16.481 --> 14:18.108
Mom!

14:18.108 --> 14:20.110
Can you come right now?

14:21.486 --> 14:23.071
What happened?

14:24.572 --> 14:25.657
Let's go! Let's go!

14:26.700 --> 14:27.867
Oh, my gosh, Mom.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.577
Where's my husband?

14:29.577 --> 14:30.620
Bob?

14:30.620 --> 14:32.163
Where's Dad?

14:34.708 --> 14:35.709
Dad?

14:35.709 --> 14:36.710
Is he in there?

15:02.485 --> 15:04.529
It's my fault.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.702
Dad?

15:10.702 --> 15:12.287
- Dad!
- Dad!

15:12.287 --> 15:13.496
Girls!

15:15.290 --> 15:17.125
Come here.
It's okay. It's okay.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.794
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I'm right here.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.004
I'm right here. It's okay.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.381
- The store...
- Let it burn.

15:23.381 --> 15:24.466
Let it burn.

15:24.466 --> 15:27.177
I got everything I need
right here.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.269
It's okay.

15:58.792 --> 16:03.046
<i>They're watching,
and they're angry with you.</i>

16:08.093 --> 16:10.178
Great American novel?

16:11.429 --> 16:14.265
It'll actually be
my second book.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.142
- Wow.
- Yeah.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.686
Um, you had visitors today.

16:17.686 --> 16:19.062
Oh.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.605
Two men who said
it was very important.

16:20.605 --> 16:23.274
But, um, you don't have
visitation privileges.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.527
Well, that's just my luck.

16:27.445 --> 16:30.907
Well, it's probably
about my kids.

16:30.907 --> 16:35.036
My oldest is, uh...

16:35.036 --> 16:37.497
he's got some problems
with his legs.

16:37.497 --> 16:40.291
And, uh,
his mother's running around

16:40.291 --> 16:42.252
with some clown now, so...

16:43.962 --> 16:47.173
Anyway.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.675
Yeah.
- They left this.

16:48.675 --> 16:52.053
Really, I'm supposed to give it
to your doctor.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.097
I'm raising one on my own too.

16:54.097 --> 16:55.140
Oh.

17:46.941 --> 17:49.861
Shh. It's okay.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.120
I--I wasn't doubting.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.499
I still believe.

18:14.803 --> 18:16.763
I breathe out me.

18:19.724 --> 18:22.686
And I breathe in
who I wanna be.

18:31.695 --> 18:33.571
Hello? Brobergs.

18:33.571 --> 18:34.823
<i>Dolly?</i>

18:37.992 --> 18:39.744
This is she.

18:39.744 --> 18:40.912
<i>Hi.</i>

18:40.912 --> 18:42.747
<i>I've been speaking
with your father.</i>

18:42.747 --> 18:45.542
<i>He asked me to call you
and tell you he's okay</i>

18:45.542 --> 18:47.627
<i>and he'll be getting out soon.</i>

18:50.088 --> 18:52.465
Well, that's--
that's good to hear.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.884
<i>Apparently, it was all
just a big mix-up.</i>

18:54.884 --> 18:56.177
<i>Between you and me,</i>

18:56.177 --> 18:58.763
<i>we're a bit surprised
he's in here at all.</i>

19:00.807 --> 19:03.518
<i>Do you have a pen?</i>

19:03.518 --> 19:04.686
Uh...

19:04.686 --> 19:06.521
I have a pencil.

19:06.521 --> 19:07.939
<i>Yep, that's just fine.</i>

19:07.939 --> 19:09.232
<i>Uh, write this down.</i>

19:09.232 --> 19:12.152
<i>He'll meet you
the evening of the 17th</i>

19:12.152 --> 19:13.528
<i>at Fort Hall.</i>

19:13.528 --> 19:17.866
<i>That's
8427 Faulkner Loop Road.</i>

19:31.921 --> 19:33.757
Ah, Dolly.

19:33.757 --> 19:36.760
It's been so long
since I've seen you.

19:36.760 --> 19:37.927
Anybody follow you?

19:37.927 --> 19:39.512
Uh, I don't think so.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.889
I had to get Caroline
to fib for me.

19:40.889 --> 19:42.682
Supposed to be
at church right now.

19:44.142 --> 19:46.102
What's on your mouth?

19:46.102 --> 19:47.854
It...

19:47.854 --> 19:48.897
Oh.

19:48.897 --> 19:49.898
What?

19:49.898 --> 19:51.316
Dolly.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.697
Do you want to wipe it off,

19:57.697 --> 19:59.240
or shall I?

20:16.049 --> 20:17.717
You shouldn't wear lipstick.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.553
It--it ruins
your natural beauty.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.722
That's--that's better.

20:28.019 --> 20:30.397
Do you think
that we can get more time?

20:30.397 --> 20:32.857
For what?

20:32.857 --> 20:34.442
For the mission.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.403
Have--have they talked to you?

20:36.403 --> 20:37.904
You know, why don't we talk
about that later?

20:37.904 --> 20:39.239
Come on.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.407
But...

20:53.503 --> 20:55.922
<i>♪ Oh, show me the way ♪</i>

20:55.922 --> 21:00.427
I'm sure Jani's having fun
at the Beehive event.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.594
<i>♪ Give me a sign ♪</i>

21:01.594 --> 21:03.430
And she's with Caroline.

21:06.891 --> 21:12.147
<i>♪ Stay with your arms
around me ♪</i>

21:12.147 --> 21:18.111
<i>♪ Say with your lips
you care ♪</i>

21:18.111 --> 21:22.532
<i>♪ Oh, give me a sign
so I'll know ♪</i>

21:22.532 --> 21:24.200
I miss you, Bob.

21:24.200 --> 21:28.747
<i>♪ For hope
is the essence of love ♪</i>

21:28.747 --> 21:30.081
I miss...

21:30.081 --> 21:31.958
I miss being with you.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.713
It's been a long time.

21:36.713 --> 21:42.510
<i>♪ Stars that are shining
up above ♪</i>

21:42.510 --> 21:44.346
<i>♪ Take me in your arms ♪</i>

21:44.346 --> 21:48.433
Do you want to talk about...

21:48.433 --> 21:53.480
whatever happened back then

21:53.480 --> 21:54.939
with you and him?

21:54.939 --> 22:00.153
<i>♪ Tell me that you
are my lover ♪</i>

22:00.153 --> 22:05.492
<i>♪ Won't you take me, dear,
and hold me in your arms? ♪</i>

22:07.243 --> 22:09.829
There's nothing to talk about.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.502
You know I love you.

22:18.880 --> 22:24.844
<i>♪ Show me the way
to your heart ♪</i>

22:24.844 --> 22:26.846
<i>♪ Say you'll be mi-- ♪</i>

22:39.567 --> 22:41.778
Do you think it worked?

22:43.488 --> 22:45.782
Will I bear a child
to save them?

22:47.992 --> 22:49.953
Oh, um...

22:54.541 --> 22:57.502
Time will tell, Dolly.

22:57.502 --> 22:59.087
Time will tell.

23:07.095 --> 23:11.349
What do you think it feels
like to be vaporized?

23:11.349 --> 23:13.476
Well...

23:19.149 --> 23:21.735
My best guess is it's, uh--

23:21.735 --> 23:25.572
it's like your soul

23:25.572 --> 23:29.743
being torn in half,

23:29.743 --> 23:35.999
and then
both those halves being

23:35.999 --> 23:37.876
torn in half again and--

23:37.876 --> 23:39.294
and the tearing
just keeps going

23:39.294 --> 23:41.546
till there's nothing left
to tear.

23:43.715 --> 23:47.844
And then all those dead atoms

23:47.844 --> 23:51.306
are scattered
into the universe,

23:51.306 --> 23:53.475
lost forever.

23:55.852 --> 23:59.230
It probably won't start
with you, though.

23:59.230 --> 24:01.900
It'll start
with someone close to you.

24:08.323 --> 24:10.658
Anyway...

24:13.078 --> 24:14.829
Let's get you home, kid.

24:21.670 --> 24:25.507
I--I knew it was a sign
whenever the shop burned,

24:25.507 --> 24:27.258
you know, like--like a warning.

24:28.885 --> 24:29.678
Yeah.

24:29.678 --> 24:31.179
Yeah, exactly.

24:33.056 --> 24:35.725
Yep, and then you'll
be vaporized

24:35.725 --> 24:37.227
on the night
of your 16th birthday

24:37.227 --> 24:40.105
and probably blind Karen next,

24:40.105 --> 24:43.525
if they don't do it before, and...

24:43.525 --> 24:46.695
then they'll just remove Bob.

24:46.695 --> 24:49.739
What does remove mean?

24:49.739 --> 24:52.033
Your guess is as good as mine.

24:54.452 --> 24:57.831
But, uh...

24:57.831 --> 25:01.668
there is one thing I do know,

25:01.668 --> 25:03.795
is that they will take Susan,

25:03.795 --> 25:06.756
and they will make her
the new female companion.

25:07.716 --> 25:09.050
So...

25:13.013 --> 25:15.098
I'm not letting them
take Susan instead of me.

25:16.933 --> 25:19.060
She'd be better off dead.

25:21.771 --> 25:23.898
Would she?

25:27.110 --> 25:28.403
You know,
I wouldn't be surprised

25:28.403 --> 25:31.072
if she starts getting messages
from them soon.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.617
Then when
can I see you again?

25:34.617 --> 25:36.202
This week?

25:37.746 --> 25:40.373
I'm being watched
by the government.

25:40.373 --> 25:45.086
And, uh, when they figure out
that I lost them tonight,

25:45.086 --> 25:49.090
boy, they're gonna be
watching me even closer, so...

25:50.383 --> 25:52.719
What you need to do
is get your parents

25:52.719 --> 25:53.928
to let us get married.

25:53.928 --> 25:55.638
Otherwise,
it's gonna be too dangerous

25:55.638 --> 25:57.724
to meet in person.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.142
All right?

26:00.560 --> 26:01.978
I d--

26:04.105 --> 26:05.231
Hey.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.776
You turn that frown
upside down.

26:07.776 --> 26:10.403
The good news is,

26:10.403 --> 26:12.781
it's all up to you.

26:29.798 --> 26:31.883
B, I'm scared.

26:35.345 --> 26:36.638
I am too.

26:38.473 --> 26:41.101
You know, uh...

26:43.395 --> 26:49.401
Whatever happens to us,
you just remember

26:49.401 --> 26:51.486
you'll always be my Dolly.

28:14.569 --> 28:16.404
Go to sleep.

28:18.531 --> 28:20.241
Susan?

28:22.952 --> 28:26.039
If I ever anything bad to you

28:26.039 --> 28:29.834
and you don't understand why,

28:29.834 --> 28:32.128
it's because I love you.

28:32.128 --> 28:34.047
Okay?

29:14.796 --> 29:19.217
<i>Heavenly Father,
please help me.</i>

29:19.217 --> 29:23.346
<i>It's better for Susan and me
to be dead than vaporized.</i>

29:27.267 --> 29:30.812
I know that killing is wrong.

29:32.981 --> 29:35.817
<i>But I have to do it today.</i>

29:39.571 --> 29:45.660
<i>Please bless Mom and Dad
and Karen and Caroline</i>

29:45.660 --> 29:48.663
<i>not to be too sad.</i>

29:48.663 --> 29:51.332
<i>Tiffy and Bandit too.</i>

29:55.503 --> 29:59.883
<i>In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</i>

30:14.731 --> 30:17.067
I just saw Jan
head downstairs.

30:17.067 --> 30:18.276
All right.
Well, go get the cake.

30:18.276 --> 30:20.028
I'll take care of the rest.

30:28.036 --> 30:30.622
Caroline, Melanie,
it's good to see you girls.

30:30.622 --> 30:33.833
Mr. Broberg,
this is my beau, Sean Barker,

30:33.833 --> 30:35.502
and this is his cousin, Eric.

30:35.502 --> 30:38.129
Okay. Well, come on in.

30:40.173 --> 30:43.051
Thank you, Mr. Broberg.

30:43.051 --> 30:44.552
Hey, what are you
getting into?

30:44.552 --> 30:45.637
Come.

30:45.637 --> 30:47.389
Inside.

30:47.389 --> 30:48.515
This way.

30:48.515 --> 30:50.475
Come on.

30:57.273 --> 30:59.025
Yeah, I had so much fun.

30:59.025 --> 31:00.985
Ah, there she is.

31:00.985 --> 31:02.612
Ta-da.

31:02.612 --> 31:03.947
Hey, Jan.

31:03.947 --> 31:05.532
Where's Susan?

31:05.532 --> 31:09.494
She is wrapping a very
special present, I believe.

31:09.494 --> 31:10.995
That's all I know.

31:12.372 --> 31:16.167
H-hey. Um, happy birthday.

31:16.167 --> 31:18.586
I'm Sean's cousin.

31:18.586 --> 31:21.881
Yeah. Yeah, I know
who you are from school.

31:21.881 --> 31:23.842
I hope it's okay that I came.

31:23.842 --> 31:25.719
Caroline said
I should tag along.

31:25.719 --> 31:27.387
Mm-hmm.

31:27.387 --> 31:29.180
I don't know if you've
already promised somebody,

31:29.180 --> 31:31.725
but Caroline said probably not,

31:31.725 --> 31:33.727
so I just wanted to ask you

31:33.727 --> 31:36.312
if you would like to go to
the dance with me next Friday.

31:37.897 --> 31:39.482
I can't.

31:39.482 --> 31:41.067
Oh.

31:41.067 --> 31:43.028
Sure, yeah, okay. Sorry.

31:43.028 --> 31:44.612
I have to find my sister.

31:44.612 --> 31:47.282
No worries. Sorry.

31:48.742 --> 31:52.120
Jan, what did he say?

31:52.120 --> 31:54.039
Did he ask you?

31:54.039 --> 31:55.999
- Dad?
- Yeah?

31:55.999 --> 31:59.044
Tiffy and Bandit are
sick or something.

31:59.044 --> 32:00.920
Can you hurry up?
- W-Wait.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.172
Calm down.
Calm down, all right?

32:02.172 --> 32:03.673
We'll call the vet, all right?

32:03.673 --> 32:05.717
And--and me or your mom
will--will take them.

32:05.717 --> 32:06.926
What's wrong with them?

32:06.926 --> 32:08.261
What's happening?

32:08.261 --> 32:09.679
I don't know, honey.

32:09.679 --> 32:11.348
But don't worry.

32:11.348 --> 32:13.099
They probably just ate
something they shouldn't.

32:13.099 --> 32:14.559
Your mom'll be home soon.

32:33.536 --> 32:36.581
Jan, you're not
supposed to see this.

32:36.581 --> 32:38.792
Uh, stay there.

32:38.792 --> 32:40.293
Uh, what's going on out there?

32:40.293 --> 32:42.379
I heard loud voices.

32:44.673 --> 32:46.508
Hey.

32:46.508 --> 32:47.467
Give me that.

32:47.467 --> 32:49.219
Wait, Jan, no.

32:49.219 --> 32:50.970
Jan, you ruined it.

32:50.970 --> 32:52.931
You weren't supposed to see.

32:58.061 --> 33:00.021
Jan?

33:05.443 --> 33:07.821
When did it get here?

33:07.821 --> 33:09.155
Today.

33:09.155 --> 33:11.116
I had to do a mail order.

33:11.116 --> 33:13.743
I saved up all my pocket money
to get it.

33:17.497 --> 33:18.665
White noise.

33:18.665 --> 33:19.666
See?

33:21.418 --> 33:24.587
I got it 'cause I know
you can't sleep sometimes.

33:24.587 --> 33:26.381
I wanted to help.

33:46.401 --> 33:47.986
What's going on, Jan?

33:47.986 --> 33:49.612
You're scaring me.

34:07.213 --> 34:08.923
I just hope
it won't be as bad for you

34:08.923 --> 34:11.551
as it was for me.

34:11.551 --> 34:14.054
What are you talking about?

34:16.639 --> 34:18.266
You're stronger.

34:19.976 --> 34:23.396
You'll bear the burden
better than I ever did.

34:25.648 --> 34:27.609
Are you going
to run away again?

34:32.781 --> 34:35.617
There's nowhere left
to run to.

34:39.454 --> 34:41.915
I was given
strict instructions

34:41.915 --> 34:43.708
that cake doesn't wait.

34:43.708 --> 34:45.835
Yeah, but are Tiffy
and Bandit going to be okay?

34:45.835 --> 34:47.379
Uh, yeah, girls.

34:47.379 --> 34:49.255
Uh, they're gonna be okay.

34:49.255 --> 34:50.924
They're just probably
gonna have to spend

34:50.924 --> 34:53.927
the night at the vet,
but just to make sure.

34:53.927 --> 34:55.095
Okay?

34:55.095 --> 34:56.346
Can we sing to Jan?

34:56.346 --> 34:57.597
You better.

34:57.597 --> 34:59.683
But only if you know the words.

38:21.009 --> 38:22.135
Uh-huh.

38:22.135 --> 38:23.511
Good.

38:24.763 --> 38:27.474
Thank you for throwing it.

38:27.474 --> 38:29.351
Of course.

38:51.498 --> 38:53.792
Oh, Jan, Tiffy and Bandit
are coming home.

38:53.792 --> 38:55.627
Mom went to go pick them up.

38:58.046 --> 38:59.506
They're okay?

39:00.757 --> 39:02.175
Course they're okay.

39:02.175 --> 39:04.010
They're Brobergs.

39:04.010 --> 39:06.179
Strong. Hm?

39:13.728 --> 39:15.355
Let's get you some breakfast, huh?

39:15.355 --> 39:16.898
Come here.

39:21.611 --> 39:23.405
There you go.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.992
I, uh...

39:27.992 --> 39:31.121
I love you
to the moon and back, Jani.

39:43.049 --> 39:46.302
So I heard Eric invited you
to the dance last night.

39:46.302 --> 39:47.887
Oh, he did, did he?

39:47.887 --> 39:50.098
Back to school dance
is next week.

39:50.098 --> 39:52.183
Next week? Hm.

39:52.183 --> 39:53.643
Ah.

39:53.643 --> 39:56.479
Are you going, Jan?

40:53.912 --> 40:57.707
Remember,
don't let any boys touch you.

40:57.707 --> 41:00.960
Otherwise, you'll be vaporized instantly.

45:11.086 --> 45:12.295
Come on.
I want to hear

45:12.295 --> 45:14.422
if Eric asked you
to be his girlfriend.

We're in here.

46:23.450 --> 46:24.492
Jan?

46:44.846 --> 46:45.805

46:45.805 --> 46:46.973
No.

46:46.973 --> 46:50.477
No, no, no, please.

46:50.477 --> 46:53.063
No.

46:53.063 --> 46:56.107
Who's Zada and Zethra?

46:56.107 --> 46:57.650
They said they told him.

46:57.650 --> 47:00.070
They told him that--

47:00.070 --> 47:01.738
This is B's writing.

47:13.541 --> 47:15.377
The baby...

47:17.379 --> 47:20.965
They told him that we had to.

47:29.015 --> 47:30.308
We're here.

47:30.308 --> 47:31.518
Okay?

47:31.518 --> 47:32.852
It's safe.

47:40.735 --> 47:41.945
Jan.

47:41.945 --> 47:43.405
What did B do?

48:13.435 --> 48:15.270
Just the...

48:23.111 --> 48:27.240
The first time it happened,

48:27.240 --> 48:30.076
she was in Mexico with him.

48:50.805 --> 48:55.393
Jan, it'll be okay.

49:22.087 --> 49:23.546
Yes.

49:23.546 --> 49:25.924
I mean, they're not gonna
want to help you.

49:25.924 --> 49:27.550
Good morning.

49:31.054 --> 49:34.641
Jan, what's--what's wrong?

49:34.641 --> 49:36.559
What happened?

49:47.028 --> 49:51.241
I've--
I've been lying to you guys

49:51.241 --> 49:54.577
for a really long time.

49:54.577 --> 49:58.039
I didn't want anything bad
to happen to you.

50:00.208 --> 50:05.964
Well, what--
whatever it is, honey,

50:05.964 --> 50:07.382
we're here.

50:15.807 --> 50:17.100
Come here, sweetheart.

50:19.060 --> 50:21.146
It's okay.

50:29.571 --> 50:35.160
In B's motor home,
before he went to Mexico...

50:35.160 --> 50:37.162
something happened.

50:37.162 --> 50:41.791
And--and there were
these people from--

50:41.791 --> 50:46.046
from another planet
who were talking to me.

50:46.046 --> 50:48.757
From another planet?

50:48.757 --> 50:52.177
Do you--do you mean aliens?

50:53.928 --> 50:57.265
It's just they told me that
I was one of them and that--

50:57.265 --> 51:01.436
and that they needed my help
to save their people.

51:04.647 --> 51:06.483
How?

51:08.693 --> 51:15.200
It's just they said that
I had to have a baby with B,

51:15.200 --> 51:18.620
and I've been trying to
since I was 12.

51:20.455 --> 51:21.873
I'm just--I'm sorry.

51:21.873 --> 51:24.125
I couldn't tell anyone.
- Oh, my God.

51:30.131 --> 51:31.758
I'm sorry, Dad.

51:31.758 --> 51:33.218
Oh.

51:33.218 --> 51:34.761
Come here.
- Sorry.

51:34.761 --> 51:36.221
Oh.

51:36.221 --> 51:37.430
Come here.

51:37.430 --> 51:38.973
None of this is your fault.

51:40.225 --> 51:42.102
Jani.

51:45.855 --> 51:48.733
Can you please forgive me?

51:52.195 --> 51:55.281
We made every mistake
in the world.

51:55.281 --> 51:58.493
You have done nothing wrong.

52:00.412 --> 52:04.040
You could tell us anything.

52:04.040 --> 52:08.086
We will never stop loving you.

52:08.086 --> 52:09.504
Okay?

52:11.297 --> 52:13.174
It's okay.

52:14.384 --> 52:16.678
It's all right.

52:22.267 --> 52:24.936

these blue edges.

52:39.325 --> 52:41.077

52:41.077 --> 52:43.121
Um...

52:43.121 --> 52:44.247
Oh.

52:45.790 --> 52:47.208
What can I say?

52:47.208 --> 52:48.418
That's a Bingo Bango.

52:48.418 --> 52:49.836
Mm. Ah, I got it.

52:49.836 --> 52:50.920
Wow.

52:52.589 --> 52:54.299
Ooh, I guess
I'll go and get that

52:54.299 --> 52:55.884

my part of the puzzle.
