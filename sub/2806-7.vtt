00:03.461 --> 00:05.295
- Morning.
- Hi.

00:05.755 --> 00:07.297
How was your date?

00:07.841 --> 00:09.883
- Pretty good.
- Oh, good.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.388
- Aah!
- My God. Sorry about that.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.850
Okay, really good.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.643
I gotta go. I'm late.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.937
You're going to leave her with me?

00:22.147 --> 00:24.189
Don't worry, she's a terrific girl.

00:24.441 --> 00:25.774
Can you do me a favor?

00:26.026 --> 00:30.404
Could you mention I'm not looking
for a relationship? That'd be great.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.573
What, are you kidding?

00:32.782 --> 00:36.201
Just casually slip it in, you know.
Lay the groundwork.

00:36.453 --> 00:39.705
Tell her I'm a loner. No, an outlaw.

00:39.956 --> 00:43.042
She doesn't want to get mixed up
with the likes of me.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.626
That's a lot to remember.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.962
Can't I tell her that you're a pig?

00:47.714 --> 00:49.965
I'm gonna call her later myself.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.425
Honest.

00:51.676 --> 00:54.720
Chandler used to do it.
He'd make her pancakes.

00:54.971 --> 00:57.639
He'd make extras and leave them for me.

00:58.141 --> 01:01.393
I'm not telling her anything.
It's not my responsibility.

01:01.603 --> 01:02.853
Fine.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.523
Now, where did we land
on those pancakes?

01:10.445 --> 01:11.612
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:11.821 --> 01:15.032
Sorry, but I couldn't get
that lock to work.

01:15.241 --> 01:18.327
Yeah, Joey kind of disabled it
when I moved in.

01:18.995 --> 01:21.705
- You must be Rachel. I'm Erin.
- Hi.

01:22.415 --> 01:26.919
I don't mean this to sound like high
school, but did he talk about me?

01:29.714 --> 01:31.256
Would you like some pancakes?

02:13.383 --> 02:17.261
- Come on. Why are we here?
- Okay, okay, take a guess.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.222
The hot chicks?

02:20.890 --> 02:24.893
Okay, okay, I was typing names
into the library computer earlier...

02:25.145 --> 02:26.311
...you know, for fun.

02:27.021 --> 02:29.773
And I typed mine in,
and guess what came up?

02:30.024 --> 02:31.859
My doctoral dissertation.

02:32.110 --> 02:36.155
It's right down here in the biggest
library in the university.

02:36.406 --> 02:39.032
Wow, that's actually pretty cool.

02:39.659 --> 02:44.121
There's also a book here
by a woman named Wendy Bagina.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.333
What is that?

02:49.335 --> 02:53.422
Sounds like two people are really
enjoying the Dewey decimal system.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.220
We're so sorry.

03:03.641 --> 03:06.268
You didn't bring me here to do that,
did you?

03:12.901 --> 03:14.651
She sent the chicken back again?

03:14.861 --> 03:18.989
She said it's too dry and wants
to explain to you how she wants it.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.533
I'd like to meet this chicken expert.

03:21.784 --> 03:23.535
Send the colonel in.

03:28.166 --> 03:32.336
Oh, my God!

03:34.297 --> 03:35.881
Lucky bastard.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.468
- Janice.
- How are you...

03:39.677 --> 03:44.806
...Ms. Hotshot-Chef-at-the-Big-Fancy-
Restaurant-With-the-Best-Chicken-Ever?

03:47.644 --> 03:49.228
I'm fine.

03:49.437 --> 03:52.898
Oh, what is that on your finger?
I'm blind.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.359
Oh, uh...

03:55.568 --> 03:58.278
So who's the lucky guy?

04:00.990 --> 04:03.533
Oh, my God.

04:04.744 --> 04:07.120
I am so sorry, sweetie.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.248
Are you okay?

04:10.375 --> 04:12.209
You didn't tell her we're engaged?

04:12.418 --> 04:14.920
- She saw the ring.
- Did she freak out?

04:15.129 --> 04:18.382
She was shocked,
but then again, so were most people.

04:18.548 --> 04:19.966
Eh.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.970
She actually has a boyfriend herself.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.888
Name's Clark.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.933
She also invited herself to our wedding.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.810
Clark too.

04:31.646 --> 04:32.938
You said no, right?

04:34.148 --> 04:35.399
Huh?

04:37.026 --> 04:39.111
You said no, right?

04:39.320 --> 04:42.447
She cornered me. She asked me
if the wedding was in town.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.616
- What was I supposed to do?
- Lie.

04:46.035 --> 04:48.370
How hard is that?
"Your check's in the mail."

04:48.621 --> 04:51.665
"Oh, your baby's so cute."

04:51.833 --> 04:55.544
"I can't wait to read your book, Ross."

04:57.255 --> 05:00.090
So she comes to the wedding.
Maybe it won't be so bad.

05:00.300 --> 05:04.136
Think she'll sit quietly?
Think she'll want to make a toast?

05:04.387 --> 05:08.140
You don't think she'll want
to sing "Part-Time Lover"?

05:08.891 --> 05:12.811
Oh, my God. She's not gonna like
the chicken either, is she?

05:15.815 --> 05:17.816
You know what? It'll be okay.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.569
She's probably not gonna even
want to come.

05:20.737 --> 05:24.114
- Really?
- No, that was a lie.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.658
See how easy that was?

05:27.535 --> 05:30.412
So you would have just lied?

05:30.663 --> 05:32.039
Yes.

05:32.332 --> 05:36.209
- It would have really been that easy?
- Yes.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.504
Do it Saturday. We're having
dinner with her and Clark.

05:46.888 --> 05:47.929
Hey, what's up?

05:48.139 --> 05:49.556
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.517
Hey, who's your friend?

05:52.769 --> 05:54.144
Hey!

05:54.854 --> 05:56.688
- Hey, Joey.
- Erin.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.066
You're still here.

06:00.651 --> 06:04.696
We ended up spending the day together
and had such a great time.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.699
Why wouldn't you? Erin is great.

06:07.950 --> 06:10.243
And then there's you guys.

06:10.495 --> 06:13.789
Well, listen, I better get going.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.457
- Today was great. Thanks.
- I know.

06:15.666 --> 06:16.708
Okay.

06:16.918 --> 06:19.378
And Joey, last night was fun.

06:19.587 --> 06:21.963
Yeah. I'll call you.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.091
- I'll call you too.
- Or I'll call you.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.967
- And call me.
- Okay.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.178
- Good to see you again.
- Bye.

06:28.429 --> 06:30.472
Bye-bye.
- Bye.

06:31.974 --> 06:35.018
The system kind of broke down, huh?

06:35.937 --> 06:39.523
Joey, I'm sorry. I just couldn't
tell her all those things.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.525
And we got to talking, and I...

06:41.776 --> 06:43.735
We want you to marry her.

06:44.695 --> 06:45.737
What?

06:45.947 --> 06:48.448
She is so amazing. You have no idea.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.534
Who do you think brought her here?

06:50.785 --> 06:52.119
Cupid.

06:54.330 --> 06:56.790
She's so cool.
She speaks four languages.

06:56.999 --> 07:00.168
Man, do you know what guys want.

07:03.131 --> 07:06.508
Come on, she's so perfect for you.
She's sweet.

07:06.759 --> 07:10.053
She likes baseball.
She had two beers at lunch.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.805
My beers?!

07:13.433 --> 07:15.267
Look, she's a very nice girl.

07:15.476 --> 07:18.520
We had a very good time,
but I don't see it going anywhere.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.147
You always say that.

07:20.356 --> 07:23.233
Maybe if you gave her a chance,
it would go somewhere.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.236
I'm sorry, you guys. I just don't think so.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.697
- Whatever.
- Fine.

07:28.906 --> 07:31.741
Hey, don't start judging me.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.910
You're in love with your assistant.

07:34.537 --> 07:37.873
You're sleeping with the guy
who keeps pigeons on the roof.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.083
Phoebe!

07:40.376 --> 07:42.377
Secret affair.

07:52.221 --> 07:55.098
People are doing it in front of my book.

07:56.767 --> 07:57.976
I'm sorry?

07:58.144 --> 08:02.481
My doctoral dissertation is in the library
at school. I went to see it.

08:02.648 --> 08:08.236
And there were students making babies
right in the paleontology section.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.865
Oh, my God.
Did you get to see anything good?

08:13.034 --> 08:14.284
At your school...

08:14.494 --> 08:19.623
...was there a place on campus
where students went to fool around?

08:19.957 --> 08:21.082
Yeah, there was.

08:21.334 --> 08:25.795
In the corner of the library where all
the books were that nobody ever read.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.131
Yes, there was.

08:28.508 --> 08:32.510
Great, because people kept showing up.
I think it's like a thing.

08:32.886 --> 08:34.429
Hold on a second.

08:34.679 --> 08:37.933
Fifth floor, against that back wall?

08:39.809 --> 08:41.686
Oh, for crying out loud!

08:44.941 --> 08:47.442
- So we should go catch our movie.
- What's the rush?

08:47.693 --> 08:50.362
I'd like to see the previews.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.864
The candy.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.577
- Oh, hey.
- Well, look who's here.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.329
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Erin.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.789
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi.

09:00.998 --> 09:03.625
We were about to take off
and see a movie.

09:04.210 --> 09:07.420
- Oh, no!
- What's wrong?

09:07.630 --> 09:11.841
Phoebe, we forgot that party
we have to go to.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.927
Oh, no.

09:14.929 --> 09:15.971
What party?

09:16.264 --> 09:18.098
A birthday party.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.642
Whose birthday party?

09:20.893 --> 09:23.103
Alison's birthday party.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.940
Oh. And how old is Alison?

09:27.191 --> 09:28.567
Thirty-two.

09:31.445 --> 09:35.407
Wait a minute.
Why don't you guys do something?

09:35.616 --> 09:38.285
Look how that worked out.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.501
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here.

09:46.752 --> 09:51.548
Do you know the paleontology section,
fifth floor, stack 437?

09:51.757 --> 09:54.634
Well, yes. Just give me five minutes.

09:54.885 --> 09:58.138
I just have to find someone
to cover my shift.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.393
No, no, no.

10:03.644 --> 10:05.645
Can I speak to someone in charge?

10:09.567 --> 10:10.567
How can I help?

10:10.735 --> 10:14.112
Hi, I was wondering, is it possible
to increase security...

10:14.363 --> 10:16.281
...in the paleontology section?

10:16.490 --> 10:18.199
I wrote a book that's up there.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.785
And instead of reading it, people are...

10:21.037 --> 10:24.164
Well, they're rolling around in front of it.

10:25.249 --> 10:29.085
We are aware of the problem
you're referring to.

10:33.341 --> 10:37.052
As far as increasing security,
I'm afraid the library's understaffed.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.721
I can't help you.

10:40.222 --> 10:41.765
Well, fine.

10:41.932 --> 10:44.684
If I'm the only person
with any appreciation...

10:44.852 --> 10:48.688
...of the sanctity of the written word,
then I'll go defend it myself.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.691
Don't you follow me.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.779
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:56.155 --> 10:59.157
- How did it go with Erin?
- Unbelievable.

10:59.408 --> 11:01.368
We had the best time.

11:01.535 --> 11:02.535
Yay!

11:02.703 --> 11:06.164
- So you're not mad anymore?
- No, no. You guys were totally right.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.625
This was much better than the first date.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.378
It was awkward. We were both nervous.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.673
- Didn't you sleep together?
- Yeah, that calms me down.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.677
And we have so much in common.

11:18.928 --> 11:24.349
She loves sandwiches, sports.
Although she is a Met fan.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.060
Not an issue now, but if we had kids...

11:27.228 --> 11:31.356
Oh, my God! Listen to you talking
about having kids.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.901
Oh, my Joey.

11:35.152 --> 11:37.862
- Please don't get married before I do.
- Oh.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.493
Oh!

11:43.703 --> 11:47.372
I just cannot believe
that Clark stood me up.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.082
He may still show up.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.542
What are you, stupid?

11:51.877 --> 11:55.338
- It's been three hours.
- Is that all?

11:56.298 --> 11:59.926
Let's go on to happier things.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.679
Why don't you tell me
about your lovely wedding?

12:02.888 --> 12:07.684
There was something that we wanted
to tell you about the wedding.

12:07.935 --> 12:11.187
It's going to be a small ceremony.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.314
Tiny.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.152
We're not even sure why we're having it.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.905
It's actually going to be just family.

12:22.116 --> 12:25.577
Oh, wait.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.456
You two think of me as family?

12:33.169 --> 12:36.421
I have to ask you something now,
and be honest.

12:36.630 --> 12:41.259
Do you want me to sing
"Careless Whisper" or "Lady in Red"?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.890
How can you say that?
The Mets have no closer.

12:47.141 --> 12:50.393
- What about Benitez?
- What about game one of the Series?

12:50.644 --> 12:53.104
- What about shut up?
- You shut up.

12:53.939 --> 12:56.065
I love arguing with her.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.401
- Be right back.
- Okay.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.154
How's it going with Joey?

13:01.363 --> 13:03.323
Oh, okay.

13:03.574 --> 13:04.949
Okay?

13:05.159 --> 13:09.162
Tell me that you like him, please.
I mean, tell me that you like him.

13:09.580 --> 13:13.750
He's a really great guy, and I know
you really want this to work out...

13:13.959 --> 13:16.920
...but I just don't see this having a future.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.421
What?

13:19.465 --> 13:22.342
But you said that you liked him.
What happened?

13:22.593 --> 13:25.345
Did you just change your mind?

13:25.846 --> 13:28.556
- Kind of.
- Then change it back!

13:29.683 --> 13:33.394
I'm sorry. It's just there's no real spark.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.438
Didn't you sleep together?

13:35.856 --> 13:37.065
Yeah.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.983
Tramp.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.362
Does Joey have any idea?

13:42.613 --> 13:44.948
I don't think he does. You know what?

13:45.199 --> 13:47.951
Maybe you could tell him
I'm not interested...

13:48.202 --> 13:50.119
...in a serious relationship.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.790
You mean, like,
that you're kind of a loner?

13:53.999 --> 13:55.416
Yeah, that'd be great.

13:55.751 --> 13:59.504
- And maybe that you're a real stronzo.
- I'm sorry?

13:59.672 --> 14:03.383
I guess Italian isn't one
of the four languages you speak.

14:05.761 --> 14:08.388
- Hey. Want to go?
- Yeah, let's go.

14:08.639 --> 14:11.891
- Okay. See you guys later.
- Bye, guys.

14:12.601 --> 14:14.811
Hey, thank you so much.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.524
Wow.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.569
I guess it wasn't Cupid
that brought her here.

14:22.820 --> 14:26.364
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.040
Yes, yes. How can I help you?

14:36.208 --> 14:38.001
We were just looking around.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.587
Oh, you're fellow scholars.

14:40.754 --> 14:43.256
What exactly were you looking for?

14:43.424 --> 14:44.424
Perhaps...

14:44.592 --> 14:47.594
Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings...

14:47.803 --> 14:50.597
...on the Smilodon californicus?

14:51.932 --> 14:53.099
- Uh...
- Uh! Uh!

14:53.309 --> 14:54.434
Get out of here!

15:04.111 --> 15:05.653
Meeting someone?

15:05.863 --> 15:08.573
Or are you just here to brush up...

15:08.824 --> 15:11.743
...on Merriam's views on evolution?

15:12.036 --> 15:16.623
Actually, I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

15:21.253 --> 15:24.547
I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

15:24.798 --> 15:27.967
I'm sorry. Who are you?

15:28.177 --> 15:30.386
I'm a professor here. Ross Geller.

15:30.638 --> 15:34.307
Ross Geller?
Why do I know that name? It's a...

15:34.683 --> 15:35.725
Wait.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.022
Did you write this?

15:41.899 --> 15:43.399
Yes.

15:46.570 --> 15:50.490
You're the person
who checked out my book?

15:51.617 --> 15:56.412
You know, you look nothing
like I would have thought.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.331
You're so young.

15:59.500 --> 16:03.544
Well, I skipped fourth grade.

16:11.178 --> 16:15.640
I am very, very sorry.

16:21.730 --> 16:22.897
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.148
Hi.

16:24.316 --> 16:28.236
- So how was your date?
- Great. We walked around the Village.

16:28.404 --> 16:31.030
We went to this ice cream place.
Split a milk shake.

16:31.281 --> 16:32.949
Seventy-thirty, but still.

16:34.034 --> 16:37.787
I'm thinking of taking her upstate
to one of those bed-and-breakfasts.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.289
Really? She said she wants to go?

16:40.541 --> 16:45.169
No, it's a surprise. It's gonna be tricky,
because she's busy at work.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.671
- Oh.
- Oh.

16:47.172 --> 16:50.508
Joey, look, honey, we need to talk, okay?

16:51.135 --> 16:52.719
Um...

16:52.928 --> 16:54.929
I got the feeling from her...

16:55.180 --> 16:59.600
...that she's not looking
for a serious relationship.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.312
- Where are you getting this?
- She told me.

17:05.273 --> 17:07.525
She said she's kind of a loner.

17:08.777 --> 17:14.198
Oh.

17:16.076 --> 17:18.368
- Joey...
- Hey, Rach, it's cool, you know.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.289
I'm a loner too, right?

17:22.415 --> 17:25.752
Hey, Joey. You know what?
You are way too good for her.

17:25.961 --> 17:30.882
I promise, next time I will tell them
you're not looking for a relationship.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.550
No.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.721
No, don't do that. Just...

17:38.599 --> 17:41.726
- Next time, make sure she likes me.
- Well, that too.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.191
Joey?

17:49.526 --> 17:50.693
Yeah?

17:51.528 --> 17:53.613
- Do you want some pancakes?
- Finally.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.202
What are we gonna do?

17:59.703 --> 18:01.454
I say we go with "Careless Whisper."

18:05.501 --> 18:06.626
Chandler?

18:07.002 --> 18:09.462
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?

18:14.343 --> 18:16.344
Janice, what are you doing here?

18:16.595 --> 18:19.388
I thought I was gonna go back
to my apartment...

18:19.640 --> 18:24.852
...but I just felt like I really
couldn't be alone tonight.

18:30.359 --> 18:34.112
I was just wondering if I could maybe
stay here with you.

18:34.363 --> 18:37.698
Just I really feel like I need
to be with family.

18:39.701 --> 18:42.912
Our kids are gonna call her
Aunt Janice, aren't they?

18:43.413 --> 18:48.334
Please. Because otherwise,
I really don't know what I might do.

18:48.877 --> 18:52.630
Aren't you just a teensy bit curious?

18:54.049 --> 18:56.634
- You have any tissues?
- Yeah, in the bathroom.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.973
We'll just let her stay.

19:02.182 --> 19:06.602
No. If we let her stay,
she will stay forever.

19:07.604 --> 19:10.857
- Kind of like your Barcalounger.
- Is that what you're thinking about?

19:11.066 --> 19:12.859
I never stop thinking about it.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.070
Hey, you guys?

19:16.280 --> 19:19.323
Do either one of you want to get
in there before I take my bath?

19:21.702 --> 19:23.536
Janice, I'm sorry...

19:23.787 --> 19:27.123
...but you can't stay here tonight.

19:27.749 --> 19:28.791
Why not?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.585
Honestly?

19:30.836 --> 19:34.046
Our apartment is a hotbed...

19:34.298 --> 19:36.841
...for electromagnetic activity.

19:38.677 --> 19:41.679
Monica and I have been immunized,
but sadly...

19:41.930 --> 19:45.474
...you have not.

19:51.231 --> 19:52.773
I'm gonna need a comforter.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.527
Do you have a hypoallergenic one?
Because otherwise I get very nasal.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.367
Do you have a cat?
Because it's already happening.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.785
Eh. Do you hear that? Listen.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.251
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
You have to go.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.461
Why?

20:16.215 --> 20:18.799
Because Chandler still has
feelings for you.

20:22.387 --> 20:23.554
He does?

20:23.972 --> 20:25.640
Say again?

20:26.350 --> 20:28.684
That's right. That's right.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.979
And that is why you can't
stay here tonight.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.358
And probably why you shouldn't come
to the wedding.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.445
Feelings. Such strong feelings.

20:40.822 --> 20:45.660
I mean, I realize that his feelings
may never completely go away...

20:45.869 --> 20:47.912
...but you can.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.832
Oh, my God.

20:52.084 --> 20:55.711
I understand. I am so sorry.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.421
I'll go.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.220
Goodbye, Monica.

21:04.471 --> 21:08.516
I wish you a lifetime
of happiness with him.

21:08.725 --> 21:09.767
Chandler.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.063
You call me when this goes
in the pooper.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.287
I've got this section covered.

21:29.454 --> 21:32.498
Yeah, in fact, I've got this baby
to shine in people's eyes.

21:32.666 --> 21:34.375
Okay, see you later.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.971
I just wanted to show Monica your book.
