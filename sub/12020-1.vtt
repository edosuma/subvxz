There's a job only a few would

00:08.556 --> 00:12.025
Dare.

00:12.059 --> 00:13.560
Last season, the dash for the

00:13.627 --> 00:15.395
Cash was fought on the smooth

00:15.462 --> 00:17.463
Playing field of canada's arctic

Just when you thought extreme

00:37.951 --> 00:39.052
I've ever been on.

00:39.119 --> 00:39.952
hugh: They say she's a

00:40.020 --> 00:41.120
Treacherous one.

00:41.155 --> 00:42.321
So I'm here to give her a shot.

narrator: Prudhoe bay, alaska

01:23.464 --> 01:25.465
On the arctic ocean holds the

01:25.499 --> 01:28.768
Mother lode of the 21st century:

01:28.802 --> 01:31.003
Oil pumped by the billions of

01:31.038 --> 01:32.371
Gallons down the trans-alaskan

01:32.406 --> 01:35.274
Pipeline to supply america's

01:35.342 --> 01:37.977
Increasing demand for energy.

01:38.045 --> 01:39.278
jack: The oil business is

01:39.346 --> 01:40.713
Obviously the bread and butter

01:40.747 --> 01:42.515
Of the state.

01:42.549 --> 01:43.616
george: It's the lifeblood of

01:43.650 --> 01:46.719
The state of alaska.

01:46.787 --> 01:47.553
narrator: But there's only

01:47.621 --> 01:50.523
One road to these ridges.

01:50.591 --> 01:52.225
And it's the most fearsome on

01:52.259 --> 01:54.627
The planet.

01:54.728 --> 01:56.629
This is the unpaved, ice-coated

01:56.697 --> 01:59.332
Track called the dalton, better

01:59.366 --> 02:02.368
Known as the haul road.

02:02.436 --> 02:04.504
It's an ice road of a deadlier

02:04.538 --> 02:07.073
Breed where trucks smash head-on

02:07.141 --> 02:09.508
Or fly off instead of breaking

02:09.543 --> 02:11.978
Through, averaging a dead man

02:12.045 --> 02:15.348
For almost every one of its 414

02:15.415 --> 02:16.249
Miles.

02:16.316 --> 02:17.016
george:T's dangerous.

02:17.050 --> 02:18.117
There's no two ways about it.

02:18.152 --> 02:19.285
There's a lot of trucks that's

02:19.319 --> 02:20.953
Upside-down up there to prove

02:21.021 --> 02:22.054
It.

02:22.122 --> 02:22.955
jack: It's curve after curve

02:23.023 --> 02:26.225
After uphill, downhill, curve.

02:26.260 --> 02:27.493
Crazy.

02:27.528 --> 02:28.127
narrator: For an ice road

02:28.195 --> 02:29.829
Trucker, this road is the

02:29.863 --> 02:31.664
Ultimate challenge, because

02:31.732 --> 02:34.100
Every mile through the alaskan

02:34.134 --> 02:36.202
Wilderness is met with a new and

02:36.236 --> 02:38.471
Unpredictable threat.

02:38.505 --> 02:40.039
The gauntlet of terror begins

02:40.107 --> 02:42.642
With a brutal initiation: 56

02:42.676 --> 02:44.911
Miles of icy hills and srp

02:44.978 --> 02:46.078
Curves.

02:46.113 --> 02:47.713
There's a white knuckle stretch

02:47.748 --> 02:49.649
Called the rollercoaster and a

02:49.683 --> 02:52.351
Hairpin turn whose name says it

02:52.386 --> 02:53.519
All.

02:53.554 --> 02:54.921
george: Oh, [bleep] corner.

02:54.988 --> 02:56.088
[laughs]

02:56.123 --> 02:58.291
Oh, [bleep].

02:58.325 --> 03:00.193
narrator: 250 miles in, the

03:00.227 --> 03:02.728
Most feared enemy... the road:

03:02.763 --> 03:05.798
4,700-foottigun pass where

03:05.866 --> 03:08.067
Avalanches strike at any moment

03:08.135 --> 03:10.970
And bury truckers alive.

03:11.038 --> 03:12.038
tim: You can freeze to death

03:12.072 --> 03:13.873
Out there in half an hour.

03:13.941 --> 03:15.041
narrator: The final assault:

03:15.075 --> 03:17.710
50 miles of windswept ice called

03:17.778 --> 03:19.612
The bluffs where temperatures

03:19.680 --> 03:22.515
Dive to 70 below and the road

03:22.549 --> 03:24.517
Can suddenly vanish in a total

03:24.585 --> 03:25.518
Whiteout.

03:25.586 --> 03:26.252
tim: Can't see a [bleep]

03:26.320 --> 03:28.254
Thing.

03:28.322 --> 03:29.422
narrator: And if the ice on

03:29.456 --> 03:31.224
The dalton road doesn't kill

03:31.258 --> 03:33.492
You, the final stretch over the

03:33.527 --> 03:38.231
Arctic ocean just might.

03:38.265 --> 03:39.131
tim: They say it's not if you

03:39.199 --> 03:45.204
Wreck, it's when you wreck.

03:45.239 --> 03:45.871
jack: You could easily die

03:45.939 --> 03:49.976
Out there.

03:50.010 --> 03:50.876
narrator: The ice road

03:50.911 --> 03:52.979
Truckers' mission: To haul more

03:53.046 --> 03:55.114
Than 6,000 loads from fairbanks

03:55.148 --> 03:57.149
To deadhorse, the gateway to

03:57.184 --> 04:00.152
The prudhoe bay oil fields.

04:00.220 --> 04:02.588
And they have just 12 weeks to

04:02.656 --> 04:05.591
Do it in.

04:05.626 --> 04:07.393
It's such a deadly route that

04:07.427 --> 04:08.961
They earn the equivalent of

04:09.029 --> 04:13.499
Combat pay...$120,000 and up.

04:13.533 --> 04:15.968
The more loads, the more cash.

04:16.036 --> 04:16.668
george: That's the

04:16.702 --> 04:18.571
Highest-paying job there is.

04:18.605 --> 04:19.772
They don't pay us this good

04:19.805 --> 04:21.240
Because it's easy.

04:21.274 --> 04:22.775
The girl scouts are not up there

04:22.809 --> 04:29.148
Doing it.

04:29.182 --> 04:30.416
narrator: 24 hours before

04:30.484 --> 04:31.784
The winter season begins,

04:31.852 --> 04:34.287
Northern lights flare in the

04:34.321 --> 04:38.324
Sky.

04:38.392 --> 04:39.692
The ragged thunder of diesel

04:39.726 --> 04:41.494
Engines builds in the yard,

04:41.561 --> 04:43.229
But the trucks are at a

04:43.297 --> 04:45.398
Standstill, waiting for the

04:45.432 --> 04:47.300
Last mile of ice road to be

04:47.334 --> 04:49.402
Built.

04:49.436 --> 04:57.276
time to go make an ice road.

04:57.311 --> 04:58.210
narrator: The dalton is paved

04:58.245 --> 05:00.146
With ice because big rigs

05:00.180 --> 05:01.914
Require a smooth driving

05:01.948 --> 05:03.683
Surface, and no other material

05:03.750 --> 05:05.284
Can hold up to the extreme

05:05.319 --> 05:07.953
Conditions.

05:08.021 --> 05:10.389
An 8,500-gallon tanker unloads

05:10.457 --> 05:13.826
Water onto the roadbed.

05:13.860 --> 05:15.328
one mile of road, and we

05:15.362 --> 05:16.729
Basically lay down 32,000

05:16.763 --> 05:19.732
Gallons of water per mile.

05:19.766 --> 05:20.566
narrator: And then a grader

05:20.600 --> 05:21.767
Does a pass over the

05:21.802 --> 05:26.872
Fast-freezing slush.

05:26.940 --> 05:28.107
we raise this road surface

05:28.141 --> 05:30.409
Almost 2 inches.

05:30.444 --> 05:31.544
This here is 2 inches of ice

05:31.578 --> 05:33.479
Exactly.

05:33.547 --> 05:35.047
narrator: But the tradeoff

05:35.115 --> 05:37.416
For an even surface of ice is

05:37.484 --> 05:39.852
A road that can turn as slick

05:39.920 --> 05:45.324
As a skating rink.

05:45.392 --> 05:47.026
The trek north begins in the

05:47.094 --> 05:48.728
City of fairbanks.

05:48.762 --> 05:50.229
Here in the yards of carlile

05:50.297 --> 05:51.931
Transportation systems,

05:51.965 --> 05:53.499
Thousands of loads are piling

05:53.533 --> 05:54.734
Up.

05:54.768 --> 05:57.303
The blue trucks of carlile are

05:57.337 --> 05:58.671
One of the most familiar sights

05:58.739 --> 06:00.206
In the far north.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.007
They move a third of the freight

06:02.042 --> 06:03.542
That goes up the dalton and over

06:03.577 --> 06:04.944
The ice.

06:05.011 --> 06:05.745
it's a challenging,

06:05.812 --> 06:07.313
Dangerous road, and our goal in

06:07.347 --> 06:08.948
Our company is to run it 100%

06:09.015 --> 06:10.316
Safely.

06:10.350 --> 06:11.584
We just got a really big season

06:11.651 --> 06:13.486
Going on this winter.

06:13.520 --> 06:14.854
It's the busiest one we've had

06:14.921 --> 06:16.021
For about ten years, probably,

06:16.089 --> 06:18.391
This winter.

06:18.425 --> 06:19.225
narrator: With so much

06:19.292 --> 06:21.026
Freight to move, dispatchers

06:21.061 --> 06:23.229
Send out the word: Drivers

06:23.296 --> 06:26.665
Wanted.

06:26.733 --> 06:27.767
we're just swamped with

06:27.801 --> 06:29.034
Business.

06:29.102 --> 06:29.769
We just don't have enough

06:29.803 --> 06:31.404
Drivers right now to get on the

06:31.438 --> 06:32.471
Road.

06:32.506 --> 06:33.472
We're basically looking for

06:33.507 --> 06:34.473
Anyone that's capable of running

06:34.541 --> 06:35.474
The dalton.

06:35.542 --> 06:36.308
We've got a couple leads on

06:36.376 --> 06:37.376
Bringing some drivers out of

06:37.444 --> 06:38.477
Canada right now that are gonna

06:38.545 --> 06:41.380
Help us.

06:41.415 --> 06:42.448
narrator: Across town in

06:42.482 --> 06:44.750
Fairbanks, the canadian invasion

06:44.785 --> 06:52.725
Has already begun.

06:52.759 --> 06:53.626
hugh: Yee-haw.

06:53.660 --> 06:55.361
Fairbanks, alaska.

06:55.395 --> 06:57.029
Dalton highway, here I come.

06:57.097 --> 06:57.763
narrator: Hugh "the polar

06:57.798 --> 06:59.565
Bear" rowland has conquered just

06:59.599 --> 07:02.301
About every ice road in canada.

07:02.402 --> 07:04.670
Now he's on the prowl stateside.

07:04.704 --> 07:05.371
hugh: Everybody knows polar

07:05.439 --> 07:06.939
Bears have the right of way.

07:07.007 --> 07:08.374
narrator: And he's not alone.

07:08.408 --> 07:09.175
alex: Good morning,

07:09.209 --> 07:11.076
Fairbanks, alaska.

07:11.111 --> 07:12.011
Looks like it's gonna be a nice

07:12.045 --> 07:14.914
Morning.

07:14.948 --> 07:15.915
All I need is a truck and a

07:15.949 --> 07:19.552
Load, a map, and the dalton.

07:19.619 --> 07:21.120
Lord, go with me.

07:21.154 --> 07:22.188
narrator: Alex and hugh have

07:22.255 --> 07:24.123
A combined 60 years' experience

07:24.157 --> 07:27.927
As ice road truckers.

07:27.994 --> 07:29.395
But they've never seen anything

07:29.463 --> 07:31.630
Like the extreme hills and

07:31.665 --> 07:33.566
Curves of the dalton.

07:33.633 --> 07:35.201
They know the legend.

07:35.268 --> 07:36.936
Now they're here to drive it.

07:37.003 --> 07:37.736
hugh: You spin out on one of

07:37.771 --> 07:39.104
These hills, and she's a long

07:39.139 --> 07:40.105
Way to the bottom, and you're

07:40.140 --> 07:41.307
Upside-down by the time you get

07:41.374 --> 07:49.548
There, that's for sure.

07:49.583 --> 07:50.449
narrator: Finally, opening

07:50.484 --> 07:52.384
Day of the ice road season.

07:52.452 --> 07:55.721
[engine rumbles]

07:55.755 --> 07:57.656
The 500-mile race to the oil

07:57.691 --> 08:02.127
Fields is on.

08:02.195 --> 08:10.569
[horn honks]

08:10.604 --> 08:11.937
One of carlile's top drivers,

08:12.005 --> 08:14.607
Jack jessee, is chosen tmove

08:14.641 --> 08:16.175
The first heavy load of the

08:16.209 --> 08:17.243
Season.

08:17.277 --> 08:18.611
In alaska there are truck

08:18.645 --> 08:20.246
Drivers, and then there are

08:20.280 --> 08:22.548
Heavy haulers who move anything

08:22.616 --> 08:25.351
Oversized or overweight.

08:25.385 --> 08:25.985
jack: They put it on the

08:26.052 --> 08:26.952
Trailer, they tell me to get it

08:26.987 --> 08:29.255
There safely, I get it there.

08:29.322 --> 08:30.789
narrator: 20 feet long, 18

08:30.857 --> 08:33.292
Feet high, the massive modular,

08:33.326 --> 08:35.594
Or mod, is a structure used to

08:35.629 --> 08:37.263
House heavy equipment.

08:37.330 --> 08:39.231
This load will hang so far into

08:39.265 --> 08:40.966
The oncoming lane that it's at

08:41.001 --> 08:42.333
High risk for a head-on

08:42.402 --> 08:44.436
Collision.

08:44.504 --> 08:45.971
To run interference, jack

08:46.039 --> 08:47.973
Commands a small fleet of three

08:48.041 --> 08:50.442
Pilot cars.

08:50.510 --> 08:51.243
jack: There's gonna be some

08:51.311 --> 08:52.077
Spots where I'm really gonna

08:52.145 --> 08:53.712
Have to slow down.

08:53.780 --> 08:54.580
To go through some of the things

08:54.614 --> 08:55.147
Like this.

08:55.181 --> 08:56.916
The lolololololoload...it'll be s

08:56.983 --> 08:59.652
Of...All kinds of weird stuff.

09:04.891 --> 09:05.824
narrator: Jack's convoy is

09:05.859 --> 09:07.760
First out of the gate.

09:07.794 --> 09:09.862
Priority: Critical.

09:09.930 --> 09:10.729
you know, a heavy haul driver

09:10.764 --> 09:12.498
Has a lot more responsibility.

09:12.566 --> 09:13.732
They may have a module worth

09:13.767 --> 09:15.568
$10-12 million, and a lot of

09:15.635 --> 09:16.468
Times there might be a work crew

09:16.503 --> 09:18.203
Of maybe 20 or 30 guys waiting

09:18.271 --> 09:20.306
On that to show up.

09:20.373 --> 09:21.273
narrator: The mod has to

09:21.308 --> 09:22.741
Reach an oil rig in less than

09:22.776 --> 09:24.843
48 hours to keep production on

09:24.911 --> 09:27.279
Schedule.

09:27.314 --> 09:28.847
The express mission will take

09:28.915 --> 09:31.850
Jack over 414 miles of steep

09:31.885 --> 09:33.185
Mountain ice.

09:33.219 --> 09:35.020
And if that doesn't take him

09:35.055 --> 09:36.822
Down, he'll face the final

09:36.856 --> 09:39.024
Stretch over a frozen arctic

09:39.059 --> 09:44.363
Ocean.

09:44.397 --> 09:45.998
Virginia-born, college-educated,

09:46.032 --> 09:48.200
Jack found his calling on the

09:48.268 --> 09:49.201
Haul road.

09:49.235 --> 09:50.202
it's a freedom thing, you

09:50.270 --> 09:50.903
Know.

09:50.937 --> 09:52.404
An easy rider, get on the

09:52.472 --> 09:53.472
Motorcycle and go.

09:53.540 --> 09:55.040
You're just doing it in a truck.

09:55.108 --> 09:56.308
When you're driving a truck, it

09:56.376 --> 09:59.111
Kinda gets into your blood.

09:59.145 --> 10:01.213
You hate it sometimes, and

10:01.247 --> 10:02.181
Sometimes you just love it to

10:02.215 --> 10:02.848
Death.

10:02.916 --> 10:03.749
narrator: Now that he's at

10:03.817 --> 10:05.918
The very top of the game, he

10:05.952 --> 10:06.986
Aims to stay there.

10:07.020 --> 10:07.720
jack: My goal for this year

10:07.754 --> 10:09.421
Is to survive the year, make a

10:09.489 --> 10:11.490
Living for my family, be around

10:11.524 --> 10:13.025
To do it next year, and keep

10:13.059 --> 10:14.360
Doing it.

10:14.394 --> 10:15.260
I'm doing a job that I love to

10:15.295 --> 10:21.300
Do.

10:21.334 --> 10:22.301
narrator: 70 miles north of

10:22.335 --> 10:24.303
Fairbanks, the pavement drops

10:24.371 --> 10:26.572
Off, and the solid ice of the

10:26.606 --> 10:33.846
Haul road begins.

10:33.880 --> 10:36.081
The road narrows.

10:36.116 --> 10:38.017
Jack's pilot car drivers begin

10:38.084 --> 10:39.852
Their vigilant watch for

10:39.919 --> 10:41.120
Oncoming traffic.

10:41.154 --> 10:42.021
there's a pretty high level

10:42.088 --> 10:43.389
Of trust going on with the pilot

10:43.456 --> 10:44.390
Cars.

10:44.457 --> 10:45.290
You know, I mean, they're my

10:45.358 --> 10:50.095
Eyes, my ears, out ahead of me.

10:50.130 --> 10:51.830
'cause there's spots that I

10:51.898 --> 10:56.902
Can't meet anybody.

10:56.936 --> 10:57.736
narrator: Almost immediately

10:57.771 --> 11:01.740
The great ascent begins.

11:01.775 --> 11:03.008
Jack hits the first hill of the

11:03.043 --> 11:05.744
Trip, called "2,5 mile", with

11:05.812 --> 11:12.284
A steep grade of 8 degrees.

11:12.352 --> 11:13.552
To climb it, a heavy hauler

11:13.620 --> 11:15.754
Needs plenty of momentum, but

11:15.789 --> 11:17.723
Not so much speed that he can't

11:17.757 --> 11:19.024
Stop.

11:19.059 --> 11:19.892
jack: When you're that heavy,

11:19.926 --> 11:22.294
It takes a long distance to

11:22.328 --> 11:23.095
Stop.

11:23.163 --> 11:25.197
It's like a train.

11:25.265 --> 11:26.365
narrator: Jack slowly inches

11:26.399 --> 11:29.568
His way to the top.

11:29.636 --> 11:36.642
Tires holding on the ice.

11:36.676 --> 11:38.544
But this is just the first of

11:38.611 --> 11:40.746
Many hurdles.

11:40.814 --> 11:42.614
The monstrous rollercoaster is

11:42.649 --> 11:47.886
Dead ahead.

11:47.921 --> 11:49.822
Back at carlile, the american

11:49.856 --> 11:52.157
Veteran of the ice rolls in to

11:52.192 --> 11:54.993
Begin his 30th and final year on

11:55.061 --> 11:59.832
The road.

11:59.899 --> 12:01.266
George spears started driving

12:01.334 --> 12:02.968
The haul road because it's the

12:03.002 --> 12:04.369
Closest thing he could find to

12:04.437 --> 12:05.637
Combat.

12:05.672 --> 12:07.806
george: Veterans like myself

12:07.841 --> 12:09.108
Seek out something that's

12:09.175 --> 12:11.543
Dangerous.

12:11.611 --> 12:12.745
Something that's right on the

12:12.779 --> 12:14.446
Edge like that.

12:14.481 --> 12:16.281
People ask what's worse, to

12:16.316 --> 12:17.716
Crash into another truck or go

12:17.784 --> 12:19.084
Off a cliff?

12:19.119 --> 12:20.085
I'd just as soon not do either

12:20.120 --> 12:21.553
One of 'em.

12:21.588 --> 12:22.421
narrator: In fact, he's done

12:22.455 --> 12:24.523
Both, including flipping his

12:24.557 --> 12:26.191
Truck over a cliff.

12:26.226 --> 12:27.359
george: Boom, boom, boom,

12:27.393 --> 12:29.895
Went bounding over the hill.

12:29.929 --> 12:31.897
Rolled over twice.

12:31.931 --> 12:34.166
I walked out the windshield.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.168
It happens real fast up there.

12:36.236 --> 12:37.002
I don't care how good a driver

12:37.036 --> 12:40.005
You are or what, if you don't

12:40.039 --> 12:41.740
Have a good respect for that

12:41.775 --> 12:44.643
Road, sooner or later, it'll

12:44.711 --> 12:50.249
Reach out and grab ya.

12:50.283 --> 12:51.083
narrator: The list of fallen

12:51.151 --> 12:54.186
Drivers is long.

12:54.220 --> 12:55.721
At the last truck stop before

12:55.755 --> 12:57.523
The dalton begins stands a

12:57.557 --> 13:01.894
Memorial.

13:01.928 --> 13:03.362
And many of george's friends'

13:03.429 --> 13:07.332
Names are on the wall.

13:07.367 --> 13:08.066
george: There's my good

13:08.101 --> 13:09.234
Friend, dale harris.

13:09.269 --> 13:10.903
We called him spud.

13:10.970 --> 13:12.437
He was just an outgoing guy.

13:12.505 --> 13:13.639
He was just a lot of fun to be

13:13.673 --> 13:16.175
Around, and he's been sorely

13:16.242 --> 13:19.444
Missed.

13:19.512 --> 13:20.412
narrator: It was st last

13:20.480 --> 13:22.147
Winter that dale was driving

13:22.215 --> 13:27.152
South on a long, winding hill.

13:27.187 --> 13:29.021
He was only 60 miles from home

13:29.055 --> 13:31.123
Rounding a blind curve when

13:31.157 --> 13:32.491
Headlights stabbed the darkness

13:32.525 --> 13:35.327
Ahead.

13:35.361 --> 13:36.829
This is the haul road's greatest

13:36.863 --> 13:39.064
Danger: Two big rigs meeting

13:39.132 --> 13:41.033
Suddenly on a narrow stretch

13:41.067 --> 13:43.235
Of ice.

13:43.269 --> 13:44.736
The oncoming truck, loaded with

13:44.771 --> 13:46.471
Cement, jackknifed as it

13:46.506 --> 13:47.840
Approached.

13:47.874 --> 13:49.308
The heavy trailer drifted into

13:49.375 --> 13:50.843
Dale's lane.

13:50.877 --> 13:55.514
[crash]

13:55.548 --> 13:58.684
it was an accident.

13:58.718 --> 13:59.384
It was an accident.

13:59.419 --> 14:00.152
It was a trucker's worst

14:00.220 --> 14:03.222
Nightmare on both sides.

14:03.256 --> 14:03.956
george: See, he was about my

14:04.023 --> 14:04.857
Age, he was about ready to

14:04.924 --> 14:07.492
Retire, same as I am, so...

14:07.527 --> 14:08.694
A shame to go that long and

14:08.728 --> 14:13.198
Then not make it.

14:15.627 --> 14:16.293
narrator: Fairbanks, alaska,

14:16.361 --> 14:18.829
January 20th...opening day of

14:18.863 --> 14:22.066
The ice road season.

14:22.100 --> 14:24.101
And day one on the job for haul

14:24.135 --> 14:26.737
Road rookie, tim freeman.

14:26.805 --> 14:30.641
tim: I'm a little nervous.

14:30.675 --> 14:31.475
Well, I've listened to people

14:31.543 --> 14:32.576
Talk about the dalton all my

14:32.644 --> 14:33.644
Life.

14:33.678 --> 14:34.645
narrator: A fourth-generation

14:34.713 --> 14:37.014
Driver from minnesota, tim is

14:37.048 --> 14:38.649
Here for trucking's ultimate

14:38.683 --> 14:40.184
Challenge...

14:40.218 --> 14:41.719
And biggest payday.

14:41.786 --> 14:42.987
tim: Make some of that money.

14:43.021 --> 14:45.356
[laughs]

14:45.390 --> 14:46.457
I just feel confident because

14:46.491 --> 14:47.625
I was trained by my father,

14:47.692 --> 14:49.460
Who's been around trucks 51

14:49.527 --> 14:51.829
Years he's been alive.

14:51.863 --> 14:53.697
I taught tim how to drive.

14:53.732 --> 14:54.798
I'd say anybody that starts out

14:54.833 --> 14:55.633
Running that road's under

14:55.700 --> 14:57.101
Pressure.

14:57.135 --> 14:57.901
The minute you're not nervous up

14:57.969 --> 14:59.069
There, you better start looking

14:59.104 --> 14:59.903
For something else to do, is the

14:59.971 --> 15:00.971
Way I look at it.

15:01.006 --> 15:02.873
narrator: Before tim senior

15:02.907 --> 15:04.908
Sent his son to the ice roads,

15:04.943 --> 15:06.710
He enlisted an old friend as his

15:06.745 --> 15:07.645
Mentor.

15:07.679 --> 15:08.879
tim jr.: Scrap-iron georgie

15:08.913 --> 15:10.280
Spears.

15:10.315 --> 15:12.082
George is a good family friend.

15:12.117 --> 15:13.083
He's a case too.

15:13.118 --> 15:13.984
I love that guy.

15:14.052 --> 15:15.285
narrator: But the haul road

15:15.320 --> 15:16.720
Breaks rookie drivers.

15:16.788 --> 15:17.554
tim jr.: [bleep].

15:17.589 --> 15:18.622
This is bad.

15:18.690 --> 15:19.790
narrator: And if tim's going

15:19.824 --> 15:21.892
To succeed on this road, he's

15:21.926 --> 15:24.061
Got to show something special.

15:24.095 --> 15:25.529
tim jr.: There is no

15:25.597 --> 15:27.097
Guarantee.

15:27.165 --> 15:29.366
All I can do is hope.

15:29.401 --> 15:31.735
I'm ready to go trucking, man.

15:34.839 --> 15:36.373
narrator: Over in the carlile

15:36.441 --> 15:38.275
Shop, tim's truck is being

15:38.309 --> 15:40.177
Refitted with a set of arctic

15:40.245 --> 15:41.178
Armor.

15:41.246 --> 15:42.913
It's the first and essential

15:42.947 --> 15:44.982
Step to surviving the punishing

15:45.050 --> 15:46.183
Road ahead.

15:46.251 --> 15:47.718
jarid: These trucks have what

15:47.752 --> 15:48.886
What you would call an arctic

15:48.920 --> 15:50.354
Package from the factory.

15:50.422 --> 15:52.890
But their version of arctic and

15:52.957 --> 15:54.525
Our version of arctic up here

15:54.592 --> 15:56.794
Are two different things.

15:56.828 --> 15:59.229
We're gonna start off wrapping

15:59.264 --> 16:01.265
These lines here so that we can

16:01.299 --> 16:03.500
Keep this power steering warm.

16:03.535 --> 16:04.968
The cold that we deal with up

16:05.003 --> 16:06.704
Here...you probably don't see 60

16:06.738 --> 16:08.605
Or 70 below down in the states.

16:08.640 --> 16:09.440
narrator: In this kind of

16:09.507 --> 16:11.909
Cold, just about every fluid

16:11.943 --> 16:13.444
Could freeze solid.

16:13.478 --> 16:14.344
jarid: Once you get up there

16:14.412 --> 16:15.245
In that wind and that cold

16:15.280 --> 16:16.714
Weather, you can't steer this

16:16.748 --> 16:17.681
Truck.

16:17.716 --> 16:18.982
The fluid becomes so thick that

16:19.017 --> 16:20.350
It will not turn.

16:20.385 --> 16:21.985
narrator: If brakes aren't

16:22.053 --> 16:23.687
Protected from the elements,

16:23.722 --> 16:25.155
They can lock up without

16:25.190 --> 16:26.056
Warning.

16:26.091 --> 16:27.157
jarid: They pack up with ice.

16:27.225 --> 16:28.092
Well, then you go to step on

16:28.126 --> 16:29.093
Your brakes and you don't have

16:29.127 --> 16:29.727
Brakes.

16:29.794 --> 16:31.428
narrator: Jarid rebuilds the

16:31.463 --> 16:33.263
Brake assembly with heavy-duty

16:33.331 --> 16:34.898
Bushings to prevent ice from

16:34.966 --> 16:39.336
Building up inside.

16:39.370 --> 16:41.338
Weather-beaten batteries need

16:41.406 --> 16:46.810
Replacing...

16:46.845 --> 16:48.812
And finally, the engine needs

16:48.880 --> 16:50.180
Protecting.

16:50.215 --> 16:51.081
jarid: This will actually

16:51.116 --> 16:52.616
Keep the truck warm so that the

16:52.650 --> 16:54.151
Driver is not freezing to death

16:54.185 --> 16:55.052
While he's driving down the

16:55.086 --> 16:56.053
Road.

17:06.464 --> 17:08.665
narrator: 150 miles north is

17:08.700 --> 17:10.233
Heavy hauler jack jessee...

17:10.300 --> 17:14.037
[honking horn]

17:14.105 --> 17:16.839
Just entering a set of dips like

17:16.875 --> 17:19.143

17:54.646 --> 17:56.313
In front of jack, making it

17:56.381 --> 18:00.751
Easier for him to do the same.

18:00.819 --> 18:02.553
When tires spin out on the ice

18:02.620 --> 18:04.822

18:12.530 --> 18:13.430

18:15.433 --> 18:16.166

18:16.201 --> 18:17.868
But we're gonna get in his parts

18:17.902 --> 18:19.336
Where he spun his tires.

19:41.219 --> 19:42.686

27:25.631 --> 27:26.598
You had your trailer swinging

27:26.632 --> 27:27.232
Back and forth.

27:27.299 --> 27:28.433
narrator: Hugh narrowly

27:28.501 --> 27:29.868
Passes the exam.

27:29.935 --> 27:31.870
He walks away from this wreck,

27:31.904 --> 27:33.705
But if this happens on the

27:33.739 --> 27:35.773
Dalton, he might not be so

27:35.841 --> 27:37.976
Lucky.

27:38.043 --> 27:40.879
230 miles north is the shelf, a

27:40.913 --> 27:42.780
Narrow, high-walled passage cut

27:42.815 --> 27:43.748
Into the mountainside...

27:43.782 --> 27:46.317
Notorious for causing rollovers

27:46.352 --> 27:48.953
And head-ons.

27:49.021 --> 27:51.156
It's dangerous for any two

27:51.223 --> 27:53.291
Trucks to meet here, and jack

27:53.325 --> 27:54.926
Jessee approaches it with the

27:54.994 --> 27:56.828
Widest load on the road...

27:56.896 --> 27:58.663
An 18-foot modular.

27:58.731 --> 27:59.731
man on radio: There you go.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.466
Go smooth, uh...

28:01.534 --> 28:02.800
A lot of southbounds are

28:02.835 --> 28:04.002
Starting your way, coming

28:04.069 --> 28:05.837
Awfully fast.

28:05.905 --> 28:06.938
jack, you copy?

28:06.972 --> 28:07.839
We got a load of

28:07.873 --> 28:08.840
Southbounders...

28:08.908 --> 28:09.841
it's too dangerous over your

28:09.875 --> 28:10.642
Pass.

28:10.709 --> 28:11.643
I don't think you've got

28:11.710 --> 28:12.644
Enough room to get through that

28:12.678 --> 28:13.278
Up there.

28:13.345 --> 28:14.646
narrator: Oncoming trucks

28:14.680 --> 28:16.714
Clear his rig with as little as

28:16.749 --> 28:20.285
6 inches to spare.

28:20.352 --> 28:21.452
jack: A little snug, there,

28:21.487 --> 28:24.455
Wasn't it, dawg?

28:24.523 --> 28:25.390
narrator: But there's an even

28:25.424 --> 28:28.293
More dangerous stretch just 50

28:28.327 --> 28:31.362
Miles ahead at 4,700-foot

28:31.397 --> 28:32.363
Atigun pass.

28:32.398 --> 28:33.164
jack: What, is it starting to

28:33.199 --> 28:34.199
Blow or something?

28:37.303 --> 28:38.836
narrator: When high winds

28:38.871 --> 28:40.838
Blow through this terrain,

28:40.906 --> 28:43.975
Avalanches follow.

28:44.009 --> 28:45.810
jack: What happened up there?

28:45.844 --> 28:46.844
Avalanche or are they just

28:46.912 --> 28:48.012
Cleaning the road?

28:48.047 --> 28:49.480
yeah, an avalanche.

28:49.548 --> 28:50.348
I don't think that you'll be

28:50.382 --> 28:51.182
Able to fit between there.

28:51.217 --> 28:52.984
It was up higher than my truck.

28:53.018 --> 28:53.918
jack: When did that avalanche

28:53.953 --> 28:54.552
Happen?

28:54.620 --> 28:55.453
Just a little bit ago?

28:55.521 --> 28:56.354
must have.

28:56.388 --> 28:57.789
Looked pretty fresh.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.023
narrator: Minutes ago, an

28:59.091 --> 29:00.992
Avalanche tore down the pass

29:01.060 --> 29:03.628
And buried the road ahead in 12

29:03.662 --> 29:04.662
Feet of snow.

29:04.730 --> 29:05.630
jack, you copy, we need to

29:05.698 --> 29:06.798
Hang out here in the chain-up

29:06.832 --> 29:07.532
Area.

29:07.566 --> 29:08.633
State's getting it cleared out.

29:08.667 --> 29:09.734
It's too narrow for us to get

29:09.768 --> 29:10.969
Through there right now.

29:11.003 --> 29:13.605
jack: Oh, lovely.

29:13.639 --> 29:15.173
narrator: Jack narrowly

29:15.241 --> 29:17.008
Escaped being buried.

29:17.042 --> 29:19.244
He pulls over to wait for the

29:19.278 --> 29:22.714
Plows to clear the way.

29:22.748 --> 29:24.816
Every minute the load waits, an

29:24.850 --> 29:26.718
Oil rig crew sits idle.

29:26.752 --> 29:29.254
Yet jack still faces the heart

29:29.288 --> 29:31.556
Of alaska's avalanche alley.

29:31.624 --> 29:32.357
jack: I don't know if I even

29:32.424 --> 29:33.358
Want to go up there, you know.

29:33.392 --> 29:35.093
When one avalanche falls,

29:35.160 --> 29:35.994
There's a good chance there's

29:36.028 --> 29:37.629
Gonna be more of 'em.

29:40.304 --> 29:42.005
narrator: On 4,700-foot

29:42.039 --> 29:43.907
Atigun pass, the highest

29:43.941 --> 29:46.309
Point of the dalton, the road

29:46.344 --> 29:48.211
Suddenly disappeared under a

29:48.279 --> 29:53.016
12-foot wave of snow.

29:53.084 --> 29:55.218
Heavy hauler jack jessee and

29:55.252 --> 29:57.387
His convoy just missed getting

29:57.421 --> 29:59.222
Hit by the avalanche.

29:59.256 --> 30:00.757
Then they were delayed for two

30:00.791 --> 30:03.393
Hours by the cleanup, losing

30:03.427 --> 30:07.664
Money as the load stands idle.

30:07.698 --> 30:09.866
Finally, some good news.

30:09.900 --> 30:11.935
yes, you're good to go now.

30:11.969 --> 30:14.304
Jack, you got a copy there?

30:14.338 --> 30:19.409
jack: Okay, I'm moving.

30:19.477 --> 30:21.244
Well, anyway, they got the

30:21.278 --> 30:22.779
Avalanche cleared enough for

30:22.813 --> 30:28.284
Me to go through.

30:28.319 --> 30:29.152
Oh, it's right here's where the

30:29.220 --> 30:31.221
Avalanche was, you know?

30:31.288 --> 30:37.026
That'll stop a truck.

30:37.061 --> 30:38.228
Okay, guys, watch out for any

30:38.295 --> 30:39.329
More avalanches here.

30:39.363 --> 30:40.330
We don't want to get caught in

30:40.398 --> 30:41.398
One today.

30:41.432 --> 30:44.033
all right, here we come.

31:05.389 --> 31:07.290
jack: So we've made it up and

31:07.324 --> 31:08.324
Over the pass, through the

31:08.392 --> 31:09.125
Avalanche and down the other

31:09.193 --> 31:11.861
Side.

31:11.896 --> 31:13.129
narrator: After the pass,

31:13.197 --> 31:15.131
The road descends to the open

31:15.199 --> 31:17.033
Tundra of the north slope.

31:17.101 --> 31:20.303
Here there's yet another

31:20.371 --> 31:23.840
Prevailing danger.

31:23.874 --> 31:25.008
jack: Mother nature's

31:25.042 --> 31:26.276
Starting to pick her...pick her

31:26.310 --> 31:27.944
Fury back up again, up north.

31:27.978 --> 31:29.212
narrator: The high winds of

31:29.246 --> 31:31.047
The polar region blast across

31:31.081 --> 31:32.949
The ice without a tree or a

31:33.017 --> 31:34.484
Mountain to slow them down,

31:34.518 --> 31:36.820
Hitting a big, square load

31:36.854 --> 31:38.755
Like jack's with terrifying

31:38.789 --> 31:39.589
Force.

31:39.657 --> 31:40.490
jack: It could just, you

31:40.524 --> 31:42.559
Know, blow the truck sideways.

31:42.593 --> 31:44.661
And, uh, you know, push me off

31:44.695 --> 31:47.664
The road.

31:50.901 --> 31:51.768
narrator: One of the most

31:51.802 --> 31:53.937
Dreaded hazards of the haul road

31:53.971 --> 31:56.005
Is a whiteout...what alaskans

31:56.040 --> 31:59.042
Call a blow, and jack has just

31:59.076 --> 32:01.478
Driven into a blinding, howling

32:01.545 --> 32:04.747
Blow.

32:04.782 --> 32:07.217
These conditions cause head-on

32:07.251 --> 32:09.118
Collisions, or you can drive

32:09.153 --> 32:11.387
Off the road without knowing it

32:11.455 --> 32:13.490
And be buried alive by the snow.

32:13.524 --> 32:14.390
jack: And your motor's

32:14.425 --> 32:15.225
Gonna plug up, your air

32:15.259 --> 32:17.026
Cleaner's gonna plug up,

32:17.061 --> 32:18.761
Your motor's gonna die.

32:18.829 --> 32:20.396
You're out here so far in such

32:20.464 --> 32:21.865
Bad weather that nobody's really

32:21.899 --> 32:25.268
Gonna be able to get to you.

32:32.443 --> 32:33.576
narrator: Phase three means

32:33.644 --> 32:35.845
It's too dangerous for even

32:35.913 --> 32:37.747
Emergency crews.

32:37.781 --> 32:39.916
Truckers are now completely on

32:39.950 --> 32:45.655
Their own.

32:45.723 --> 32:47.590
Back at carlile, alex

32:47.658 --> 32:49.292
Debogorski gets ready for his

32:49.326 --> 32:51.494
First alaskan challenge.

32:51.529 --> 32:52.662
alex: I've never really been

32:52.696 --> 32:54.764
Tested by somebody.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.032
I got my license out of a

32:56.066 --> 32:57.667
Popcorn box years ago.

32:57.701 --> 32:58.835
narrator: Last year, his

32:58.903 --> 33:00.470
Run was cut short when he was

33:00.538 --> 33:02.038
Suddenly stricken with heart

33:02.072 --> 33:03.406
Trouble.

33:03.474 --> 33:04.807
This year, he's setting out to

33:04.842 --> 33:06.743
Make a comeback on a road even

33:06.810 --> 33:09.112
More dangerous than the last.

33:09.179 --> 33:10.213
yeah, I think alex

33:10.281 --> 33:11.314
Has something to prove to

33:11.382 --> 33:12.549
Himself, not only to anybody

33:12.583 --> 33:13.349
Else.

33:13.384 --> 33:14.117
He's back.

33:14.184 --> 33:14.918
He's...he's full of piss and

33:14.985 --> 33:15.585
Vinegar.

33:15.653 --> 33:16.352
He's gonna get at 'er.

33:16.387 --> 33:17.287
narrator: To pursue

33:17.321 --> 33:19.289
Alaska's big paycheck, alex

33:19.356 --> 33:21.824
Left his family of 11 children

33:21.859 --> 33:23.927
And 9 grandchildren behind

33:23.994 --> 33:25.295
In yellowknife, canada.

33:25.362 --> 33:26.930
alex: You gotta die sometime.

33:26.964 --> 33:28.398
yeah, but I don't want

33:28.432 --> 33:30.266
You to go on the ice road.

33:30.301 --> 33:31.935
he's never driven this road

33:31.969 --> 33:34.270
Before, and we hear it's quite

33:34.305 --> 33:35.305
A dangerous road.

33:35.372 --> 33:36.940
And, of course, I always worry

33:37.007 --> 33:39.275
About his health, but we're just

33:39.310 --> 33:41.277
Gonna pray that everything

33:41.345 --> 33:42.645
Goes well, and god always

33:42.713 --> 33:44.113
Looks after us.

33:44.181 --> 33:45.281
alex: Give us direction and

33:45.349 --> 33:47.216
Guidance, protect us from evil

33:47.284 --> 33:48.284
And harm.

33:48.319 --> 33:49.485
narrator: With his family's

33:49.520 --> 33:51.621
Blessing, alex is a rookie all

33:51.655 --> 33:54.190
Over again, but can he make it

33:54.258 --> 33:56.192
Through five minutes on the haul

33:56.260 --> 33:59.996
Road simulator?

34:00.030 --> 34:00.930
alex: Whoa.

34:00.998 --> 34:02.298
Run over the lawn.

34:02.366 --> 34:03.566
narrator: He's off to a bad

34:03.601 --> 34:04.467
Start.

34:04.501 --> 34:05.668
alex: I started off with

34:05.736 --> 34:06.936
The truck being turned all the

34:06.971 --> 34:08.737
Way to the right, and so when

34:08.772 --> 34:10.005
I put it in gear, the truck

34:10.074 --> 34:10.907
Just sort of drove right up on

34:10.940 --> 34:12.542
The lawn, and so I ran over

34:12.576 --> 34:14.077
About an acre of lawn before I

34:14.110 --> 34:15.645
Got back down on the road.

34:15.713 --> 34:16.379
narrator: Getting out of

34:16.447 --> 34:17.981
Town is the biggest hurdle.

34:18.014 --> 34:18.648
[horn honks]

34:18.681 --> 34:19.549
alex: Get your ass out of

34:19.617 --> 34:20.350
The way, okay?

34:20.384 --> 34:21.884
narrator: On the snowy

34:21.918 --> 34:23.186
Curves of the dalton,

34:23.253 --> 34:24.754
Alex excels.

34:24.788 --> 34:26.922
there you go, perfect.

34:26.991 --> 34:28.091
narrator: And passes like a

34:28.125 --> 34:29.025
Pro.

34:29.059 --> 34:30.126
alex: It made me seasick,

34:30.159 --> 34:31.594
And you just gotta drive this...

34:31.629 --> 34:33.496
This thing all over the place.

34:33.563 --> 34:34.731
But it went all right.

34:34.764 --> 34:36.032
good job.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.333
[alex laughs]

34:37.400 --> 34:40.036
narrator: 50 miles north of

34:40.070 --> 34:41.938
Fairbanks is rookie tim

34:41.972 --> 34:44.206
Freeman, who's having trouble

34:44.241 --> 34:46.775
With his truck's rear end.

34:46.810 --> 34:47.510
tim: I'm just trying to

34:47.543 --> 34:50.279
Concentrate on this to see if

34:50.313 --> 34:52.014
It'll do it again.

34:52.049 --> 34:53.216
narrator: The drive wheels

34:53.283 --> 34:54.851
Of his cab are hopping off the

34:54.885 --> 34:57.487
Road and skidding sideways,

34:57.554 --> 34:59.756
And he's still on the pavement.

34:59.790 --> 35:02.558
tim: I'm feeling hot.

35:04.628 --> 35:06.195
Yeah, just get it back there.

35:06.230 --> 35:08.231
It hopped.

35:08.298 --> 35:09.232
narrator: The rear end was

35:09.299 --> 35:11.034
Just rebuilt on the truck, and

35:11.101 --> 35:12.568
Either the mechanic made a

35:12.603 --> 35:14.671
Mistake or tim's got a bad

35:14.738 --> 35:16.673
Case of rookie nerves.

35:16.740 --> 35:18.274
tim: I'd like to get one...

35:18.308 --> 35:20.143
One more good pull to make sure

35:20.177 --> 35:21.411
I'm not imagining this.

35:21.445 --> 35:22.545
narrator: Either way, his

35:22.579 --> 35:24.580
Mentor and lead driver george

35:24.615 --> 35:26.816
Spears is not taking a chance

35:26.850 --> 35:29.318
On tim's safety.

35:40.898 --> 35:42.131
tim: Yeah, something's

35:42.199 --> 35:45.568
Jumping back there, george.

35:45.602 --> 35:47.837
[bleep]

35:47.871 --> 35:49.038
narrator: Eight miles from

35:49.073 --> 35:50.773
The dalton and his dream of

35:50.841 --> 35:52.775
Driving the haul road, tim

35:52.843 --> 35:54.477
Decides that his truck is

35:54.545 --> 35:56.679
Dangerously unfit for the trip.

35:56.714 --> 35:57.480
tim: Yeah, I'm bummed about

35:57.514 --> 35:58.181
It.

35:58.215 --> 35:58.948
I'm finally up here and doing

35:58.982 --> 36:02.719
It and...Now I have to go back

36:02.753 --> 36:03.853
To town.

36:03.921 --> 36:05.354
Won't even make it to the

36:05.389 --> 36:08.357
Dalton highway.

36:23.240 --> 36:24.941
This sucks.

36:25.008 --> 36:29.378
george: I know it.

36:29.446 --> 36:31.013
Those guys from minnesota, man,

36:31.048 --> 36:31.748
They're rough on equipment,

36:31.815 --> 36:32.582
Aren't they?

36:32.649 --> 36:33.449
[tim laughs]

36:33.484 --> 36:34.650
Okay, buddy.

36:34.685 --> 36:35.284
tim: All right, george.

36:35.352 --> 36:36.652
nice...it was nice working

36:36.687 --> 36:37.286
With you.

36:37.354 --> 36:38.121
[tim laughs]

36:38.155 --> 36:38.755
I sure hope they fire you

36:38.822 --> 36:40.289
When you get back to town.

36:40.324 --> 36:42.091
[tim laughs]

36:42.126 --> 36:43.493
narrator: George spears

36:43.560 --> 36:44.627
Will have to continue north by

36:44.661 --> 36:48.931
Himself while tim abandons his

36:48.966 --> 36:50.633
Load and turns back for

36:50.667 --> 36:51.934
Fairbanks.

36:51.969 --> 36:53.369
tim: I'm gonna turn around

36:53.403 --> 36:54.570
And drop this trailer here and

36:54.605 --> 36:56.172
Bring her back to town and get

36:56.206 --> 36:57.173
Her fixed and drive her

36:57.207 --> 37:00.109
Another day.

37:05.382 --> 37:07.483
narrator: 62 miles south of

37:07.518 --> 37:08.985
Prudhoe bay and the entrance to

37:09.019 --> 37:11.354
The ice road, jack jessee is

37:11.388 --> 37:13.389
Trapped by bad weather.

37:13.423 --> 37:15.024
Just up the road is a phase

37:15.092 --> 37:17.126
Three whiteout, conditions so

37:17.194 --> 37:19.061
Extreme that emergency crews

37:19.129 --> 37:21.597
Can't drive, much less jack and

37:21.632 --> 37:24.433
His high priority load.

37:24.468 --> 37:26.769
He's parked on the open tundra

37:26.804 --> 37:28.538
Until the wind dies down,

37:28.572 --> 37:30.907
Which can take days and cause

37:30.941 --> 37:32.809
Him to miss his deadline.

37:32.843 --> 37:35.812
[tapping]

37:35.879 --> 37:37.446
jack: No horsing around here.

37:37.514 --> 37:38.614
We got work to do.

37:38.649 --> 37:40.216
Just gonna hunker in and sit

37:40.250 --> 37:41.150
This one out, so there's no

37:41.185 --> 37:42.151
Need for us to go in and get

37:42.219 --> 37:43.252
Into that mess.

37:43.287 --> 37:44.520
can't see 10 feet between

37:44.555 --> 37:45.521
Us to begin with.

37:45.589 --> 37:46.355
jack: Yeah, pretty well

37:46.390 --> 37:47.690
Stuck here.

37:47.724 --> 37:48.357
see you in the morning.

37:48.425 --> 37:50.226
We'll figure it out then.

37:55.594 --> 37:56.995
narrator: As day two of the

37:57.063 --> 37:59.431
Ice road season comes to an end,

37:59.498 --> 38:02.133
So does a rookie's first attempt

38:02.168 --> 38:03.435
At driving the haul road.

38:03.469 --> 38:04.536
tim: I called my dad right

38:04.603 --> 38:05.503
Before we pulled out of the yard

38:05.538 --> 38:06.171
And asked him for any

38:06.205 --> 38:07.439
Last-minute advice.

38:07.473 --> 38:08.974
He said, "don't [bleep] up."

38:09.008 --> 38:10.275
[laughs]

38:13.479 --> 38:14.446
narrator: Tim freeman

38:14.513 --> 38:16.348
Returns to the carlile yard

38:16.382 --> 38:19.150
In fairbanks, defeated.

38:23.456 --> 38:24.155
tim: Hey, dad, what's

38:24.190 --> 38:25.156
Happening?

38:25.224 --> 38:26.358
narrator: As he breaks the

38:26.392 --> 38:28.526
News to his father, he wonders

38:28.594 --> 38:30.061
If he made the right call or

38:30.096 --> 38:32.797
Possibly caved under pressure.

38:32.832 --> 38:34.766
well, sure, yeah, absolutely

38:34.800 --> 38:36.267
There's pressure on you.

38:36.302 --> 38:37.602
If you screw up, you're gonna

38:37.636 --> 38:38.803
Hear about it for a long time,

38:38.871 --> 38:39.971
So you don't want to screw up.

38:40.006 --> 38:40.972
tim: Yep.

38:41.007 --> 38:41.606
be a professional when

38:41.674 --> 38:42.807
You're behind the wheel.

38:42.842 --> 38:44.175
tim: All right, dad.

38:44.210 --> 38:47.178
I'll talk to you tomorrow, then.

38:47.213 --> 38:48.980
Good night.

38:49.015 --> 38:50.448
narrator: Turning back on

38:50.483 --> 38:52.817
Your first run is bad enough,

38:52.885 --> 38:55.687
But 225 miles north, on the

38:55.721 --> 38:57.856
Shelf, another rookie's trip

38:57.890 --> 39:02.494
Comes to a far worse end.

39:02.528 --> 39:03.795
some tanker went off the

39:03.863 --> 39:05.897
Road up there.

39:07.833 --> 39:09.901
oh, there he is.

39:09.969 --> 39:11.169
narrator: Rescuers rush to

39:11.203 --> 39:16.141
The scene...And arrive braced

39:16.175 --> 39:18.443
For the worst.

39:18.477 --> 39:20.979
[grunts]

39:21.047 --> 39:22.614
You all right?

39:22.648 --> 39:23.681
yeah, I'm okay.

39:23.716 --> 39:24.616
not hurt or anything?

39:24.650 --> 39:26.051
We can have the medical check

39:26.085 --> 39:26.785
You out if you want to go up

39:26.852 --> 39:27.619
To pump four.

39:27.686 --> 39:28.319
no, I'm all right.

39:28.354 --> 39:30.789
okay.

39:30.856 --> 39:32.123
narrator: The driver, bruce

39:32.158 --> 39:34.426
Carl, is shaken but manages to

39:34.493 --> 39:37.395
Climb out of the wreck.

39:37.430 --> 39:39.164
He's got years of trucking

39:39.231 --> 39:41.332
Experience, but this was his

39:41.400 --> 39:42.333
First attempt on the ice.

39:42.401 --> 39:43.968
you know it hurts your pride.

39:44.036 --> 39:46.237
There's no way around that.

39:46.305 --> 39:47.939
I know I made a mistake.

39:47.973 --> 39:49.607
narrator: One mistake on

39:49.642 --> 39:51.576
This road is all it takes.

39:51.610 --> 39:53.144
I reached up to grab

39:53.212 --> 39:55.413
Something off the dash, and I

39:55.481 --> 39:56.781
Got too close to the edge.

39:56.849 --> 39:58.149
narrator: In the instant that

39:58.217 --> 40:00.051
Bruce reached over, his front

40:00.119 --> 40:01.619
Right wheel caught the edge of

40:01.654 --> 40:02.387
The road.

40:02.421 --> 40:04.422
The whole truck followed as it

40:04.457 --> 40:06.057
Flipped onto its side and slid

40:06.125 --> 40:10.795
Into the ditch.

40:10.863 --> 40:12.530
I wasn't goin' but about 25

40:12.598 --> 40:14.933
Mile an hour, but once it

40:14.967 --> 40:16.134
Grabbed and started, I couldn't

40:16.168 --> 40:20.071
Stop it.

40:20.139 --> 40:22.340
This road is no joke.

40:22.408 --> 40:25.777
It can get you, and today was

40:25.845 --> 40:32.784
My day.

40:32.818 --> 40:33.985
narrator: Prudhoe bay,

40:34.053 --> 40:35.487
Alaska.

40:35.521 --> 40:41.693
Land's end...But the beginning

40:41.760 --> 40:43.795
Of the arctic ice road for jack

40:43.829 --> 40:45.763
Jessee.

40:45.798 --> 40:48.800
In the 500 miles from fairbanks,

40:48.868 --> 40:50.702
The most dangerous road in

40:50.736 --> 40:52.604
North america threw everything

40:52.671 --> 40:54.038
It had at jack.

40:54.073 --> 40:56.141
He just missed getting hit by

40:56.175 --> 40:59.511
An avalanche, then was stranded

40:59.578 --> 41:02.413
In a massive whiteout.

41:02.481 --> 41:04.482
But now comes the danger that

41:04.517 --> 41:07.385
Deeply haunts every driver...the

41:07.419 --> 41:08.853
Possibility of breaking

41:08.888 --> 41:13.525
Through the ice.

41:13.592 --> 41:17.061
36 miles northwest of prudhoe,

41:17.129 --> 41:19.030
Jack arrives at the oil field

41:19.064 --> 41:21.299
Operated by the italian company

41:21.333 --> 41:22.700
Known as eni.

41:22.735 --> 41:23.768
jack: This is just about...

41:23.836 --> 41:25.770
It's one of the most northern

41:25.804 --> 41:28.406
Parts you can actually drive to.

41:28.440 --> 41:30.775
This oil rig we're rolling to

41:30.809 --> 41:32.310
Right here is actually just...

41:32.344 --> 41:33.511
It's right on the sea, the

41:33.579 --> 41:38.583
Arctic sea up here.

41:38.617 --> 41:40.518
narrator: He eases his rig

41:40.586 --> 41:43.154
Onto the ice road.

42:12.785 --> 42:15.220
The arctic ice cracks as it

42:15.287 --> 42:17.055
Flexes with the weight of jack's

42:17.089 --> 42:19.290
Truck.

42:26.465 --> 42:27.966
jack: It's got really big

42:28.033 --> 42:30.301
Cracks in it because ice

42:30.369 --> 42:32.103
Changes with the temperature.

42:32.137 --> 42:33.771
The colder it gets, the ice

42:33.839 --> 42:34.872
Shrinks more and actually

42:34.940 --> 42:36.040
Creates its own cracks that

42:36.075 --> 42:38.209
Way.

42:51.824 --> 42:53.324
narrator: With 48 hours and

42:53.392 --> 42:56.127
Almost 600 white-knuckle miles

42:56.161 --> 42:59.597
Behind him, jack arrives on time

42:59.665 --> 43:01.466
At the oil rig.

43:01.500 --> 43:03.301
[horn honks]

43:05.971 --> 43:07.772
jack: Here we are...

43:11.610 --> 43:15.113
60 miles west and north of

43:15.180 --> 43:18.549
Prudhoe bay right now, out in

43:18.584 --> 43:20.084
The middle of the oil field.

43:20.119 --> 43:22.587
If the oil industry wasn't up

43:22.621 --> 43:23.755
Here, digging holes in the

43:23.789 --> 43:25.456
Ground, trying to find oil,

43:25.491 --> 43:26.958
You know, the dalton highway

43:27.026 --> 43:28.293
Wouldn't be there, my job

43:28.360 --> 43:30.395
Wouldn't be there, you know, and

43:30.429 --> 43:31.496
I wouldn't...wouldn't have the

43:31.530 --> 43:32.830
Experiences up on this road that

43:32.865 --> 43:33.564
I have.

43:33.632 --> 43:34.666
It's one of the most amazing

43:34.733 --> 43:37.268
Views I've ever seen.

43:37.303 --> 43:38.269
Yeah, it's been a great

43:38.304 --> 43:39.270
Experience for me.
