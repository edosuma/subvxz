27:02.579 --> 27:04.122
King Olaf of Norway,

27:04.205 --> 27:07.042
one of the Kim Jongs,
Tito, Dalai Lama, Elvis,

27:07.125 --> 27:11.338
and not one
but two Kardashians, allegedly.

27:11.421 --> 27:12.380
[phone ringing]

27:12.464 --> 27:15.008
-Wouldn't that-- Where you going?
-[Allison] I gotta make a call.

27:15.091 --> 27:18.637
Nowadays, she's just a flophouse,
a party house

27:18.720 --> 27:23.850
for those of us not looking to be judged
by society's rules and norms.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.602
You mean, a place to hide?

27:25.685 --> 27:27.270
Exactly! It's perfect!

27:27.354 --> 27:30.357
And the best part of it is,
she's gonna look after us,

27:30.440 --> 27:31.691
no questions asked.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.443
Never ever. Right?

27:37.280 --> 27:38.114
Come on.

27:38.740 --> 27:41.076
-I may have questions.
-[Luther] Yeah, me too.

27:42.869 --> 27:44.579
This place is weird.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.456
[phone ringing]

27:54.005 --> 27:56.007
[phone line ringing]

27:59.469 --> 28:02.097
[Patrick] Hi, you've reached Patrick.
Leave a message after the beep.

28:02.180 --> 28:05.016
-[beep]
-Patrick. Hey, it's Allison.

28:05.892 --> 28:08.728
I know I've missed a few calls home.
It's just, um…

28:10.980 --> 28:12.190
Well, it's, um…

28:15.276 --> 28:16.486
Anyway, um…

28:18.154 --> 28:19.656
I'll call Claire later.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.575
Please tell her

28:23.910 --> 28:25.328
that Mommy misses her.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.041
[sharp inhale] So much.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.960
[dial tone humming]

28:36.464 --> 28:38.299
[gasps] Chet! Mon frère!

28:38.383 --> 28:42.303
It's so great to see you.
I'd like my usual suite, por favor.

28:42.387 --> 28:44.848
-[bell rings faintly]
-I've never seen you before.

28:44.931 --> 28:47.183
-See? Told you. Discreet.
-[dog whimpers]

28:47.267 --> 28:49.185
Please stop scaring my dog.

28:51.646 --> 28:53.857
-We need some rooms, please.
-[Chet] Super.

28:55.024 --> 28:57.902
And how will we be paying today?

28:59.237 --> 29:00.488
-Ah.
-Oh.

29:01.781 --> 29:03.283
[Luther] Fine. Empty your pockets.

29:03.825 --> 29:05.160
Come on. Something.

29:05.827 --> 29:08.997
-[Luther] Condom? Put the knife away!
-[Klaus] Can't exchange those for cash.

29:10.039 --> 29:11.541
Why do I have a hairnet?

29:13.376 --> 29:14.294
[Luther] Oh.

29:15.503 --> 29:16.921
[sighs] All right.

29:20.133 --> 29:21.551
Ooh.

29:21.634 --> 29:23.344
What does this get us?

29:33.688 --> 29:35.064
Two rooms.

29:35.148 --> 29:36.816
Mazel tov.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.109
-Awesome.
-All right.

29:38.193 --> 29:41.196
Well, let's Brady Bunch this bitch.

29:43.823 --> 29:46.826
[Five] Uh, meet back in the bar
in two hours so we can make a plan.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.120
[Diego] I have a plan.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.707
We attack the Sparrows,
and we take back our house,

29:52.791 --> 29:55.835
and then we punch Dad a bit
until he admits that we're better

29:55.919 --> 29:57.879
and he loves us more. Boom! Done!

29:57.962 --> 29:58.963
We're wasting time!

29:59.047 --> 30:01.007
Relax. Don't sweat it, man.

30:01.090 --> 30:03.718
Those shit birds
are staying put for a while.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.762
I bet they're as wiped as we are.

30:06.930 --> 30:07.764
-Really?
-Yeah.

30:07.847 --> 30:10.683
I mean, kicking our asses
looked exhausting.

30:10.767 --> 30:12.769
[up-tempo electronic music playing]

30:14.604 --> 30:18.107
Big one is strong but slow,
possibly stupid.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.361
Some sort of… simian hybrid.

30:21.444 --> 30:23.196
Who took the little jumpy guy?

30:23.279 --> 30:25.490
Me. Just gave him a spanking
and sent him to school.

30:25.573 --> 30:26.741
Hey-oh!

30:26.825 --> 30:28.618
[Christopher speaks]

30:28.701 --> 30:30.495
The skinny one is their weak link.

30:30.578 --> 30:35.083
Unless hiding behind couches shouting,
"Where's my daddy?" is his superpower.

30:35.667 --> 30:36.835
[treadmill chimes]

30:36.918 --> 30:40.421
Enough post-gaming.
They disrespected us, Marcus.

30:40.505 --> 30:43.216
We need to be out there
finding these freaks and taking 'em out.

30:43.299 --> 30:44.801
Oh, you mean like this?

30:44.884 --> 30:45.885
[music stops]

30:51.057 --> 30:52.183
[treadmill chimes]

30:54.811 --> 30:58.982
Can someone explain how you got
your asses handed to you in 30 seconds?

30:59.065 --> 31:01.860
Do you have any idea
what would happen to our reputation

31:01.943 --> 31:04.237
if anyone had seen that?

31:06.364 --> 31:09.325
[Marcus] I mean, we haven't faced
decent enemies for years.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.244
This could be good for us.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.371
Good for business.

31:13.454 --> 31:17.542
But only if we're smart
with our next move.

31:17.625 --> 31:19.168
-[sighs]
-[Reginald clears throat]

31:20.712 --> 31:22.046
You summoned, Number One?

31:23.172 --> 31:24.007
Sit.

31:27.385 --> 31:31.139
You spent time with these people.
What's your assessment?

31:31.723 --> 31:36.603
Unimpressive. Neanderthals on a day pass.
Cried too much and showered too little.

31:36.686 --> 31:40.440
The only thing they lacked more than grit
was any regard for one another.

31:40.523 --> 31:43.276
No loyalty. We can use that.

31:43.359 --> 31:46.321
Good. Give a full report to Christopher.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.323
[Christopher speaks]

31:51.075 --> 31:52.035
Still,

31:52.994 --> 31:55.914
I wouldn't underestimate
the Umbrella Academy.

31:56.497 --> 31:59.167
Yes, their skills are as lacking
as their hygiene,

31:59.250 --> 32:03.713
yet somehow, they saved the world in 1963.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.007
Had they not,

32:07.258 --> 32:09.594
none of you would be standing here now.

32:11.846 --> 32:13.348
Perhaps I misjudged them.

32:13.431 --> 32:16.976
[Christopher speaks]

32:17.060 --> 32:18.811
Yes, yes. I'm going.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.400
[exhales sharply]

32:24.484 --> 32:26.235
[Klaus] Not in this hotel.

32:26.319 --> 32:27.820
[gasps] Oh!

32:28.488 --> 32:30.531
See? It's paradise.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.743
High ceilings, sense of space.

32:33.826 --> 32:34.994
Aromatic.

32:35.078 --> 32:36.579
What the hell?

32:37.246 --> 32:39.666
-Where's the bathroom?
-Down the hall, or…

32:41.209 --> 32:42.835
Nature's bathroom.

32:42.919 --> 32:44.128
You're disgusting.

32:44.212 --> 32:45.463
But consistent.

32:45.546 --> 32:47.382
[Five] Let's unpack. Settle in.

32:48.091 --> 32:51.135
Unpack? Unpack what?
We don't own anything anymore.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.012
Yes, Luther. Isn't that liberating?

32:53.096 --> 32:55.014
-What are you, a commie?
-[urine trickling]

32:55.098 --> 32:57.976
No! If I wanted bunk beds
and group showers,

32:58.059 --> 33:00.186
I would've stayed in the Texas nuthouse.

33:00.269 --> 33:02.397
-At least they had free Jell-O.
-[bed springs creak]

33:03.564 --> 33:05.483
-And Lila.
-[Klaus] Jell-O!

33:05.566 --> 33:07.652
-[bed springs creaking]
-[Five] Hey, Diego.

33:07.735 --> 33:10.571
I just spent the past
20 straight days saving the world.

33:10.655 --> 33:11.614
Twice.

33:12.407 --> 33:16.494
Can I get five minutes to relax
before figuring all the new kinks out?

33:16.577 --> 33:18.079
Please and thank you.

33:18.162 --> 33:20.039
And Dad said I'd never go to summer camp.

33:20.123 --> 33:21.874
[chuckles] This is great.

33:22.750 --> 33:24.961
[Klaus] All right, I'm bored.
Cocktail, anyone?

33:25.044 --> 33:25.962
-Five?
-[Diego grumbles]

33:26.045 --> 33:27.672
[Five] I'll take a scotch if you have one.

33:27.755 --> 33:31.050
-[light string music playing]
-[cats meowing and purring]

33:33.302 --> 33:35.847
[clears throat] It's not too small.

33:35.930 --> 33:37.890
It's definitely ugly.

33:39.559 --> 33:40.768
[Vanya sighs]

33:42.937 --> 33:46.733
Last night, I was sleeping in my own bed
next to my amazing husband.

33:47.859 --> 33:50.403
I kissed Sissy goodbye a few hours ago.

33:51.654 --> 33:53.114
Give or take 50 years.

33:57.201 --> 34:00.121
I'm glad you finally found somebody
that treated you right.

34:00.955 --> 34:02.915
She saw me for who I really am.

34:05.126 --> 34:07.003
I'm not ready to give that up.

34:08.171 --> 34:09.839
I feel the same about Ray.

34:12.884 --> 34:16.929
We better not have left them just to die
in some superhero turf war.

34:19.223 --> 34:20.475
You need to go home.

34:21.601 --> 34:22.810
Hug your daughter.

34:31.736 --> 34:34.697
What if Diego's right
and the Sparrows attack?

34:34.781 --> 34:37.325
We fought the entire Commission.

34:37.408 --> 34:41.079
I mean, we can handle, what?
Seven jerks in uniforms?

34:41.954 --> 34:43.790
They just caught us off guard.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.292
Yeah.

34:55.218 --> 34:56.761
You should go to the airport.

34:58.679 --> 35:00.515
And get back to your real life.

35:01.182 --> 35:02.517
I would if I could.

35:12.735 --> 35:13.861
[Allison] Thank you.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.490
You're a good sister.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.783
-[indistinct chatter]
-[baby crying]

36:00.867 --> 36:02.577
[dramatic string music playing]

36:02.660 --> 36:03.911
[man] Dumb mistake.

36:05.454 --> 36:06.914
[boy] Mom, my hands are wet.

36:06.998 --> 36:10.251
[crying and chattering continue]

36:40.823 --> 36:42.825
[crying and chattering fade out]

36:42.909 --> 36:45.995
[sound of bees droning]

36:50.333 --> 36:53.878
[droning continues]

36:53.961 --> 36:55.963
[crowd cheering]

36:59.217 --> 37:00.218
[Marcus grunts]

37:02.595 --> 37:04.347
[helicopter flying overhead]

37:06.599 --> 37:07.558
[grunts]

37:07.642 --> 37:09.644
[cheering continues]

37:11.812 --> 37:15.858
[ominous orchestral music playing]

37:23.866 --> 37:25.409
I'm glad we're doing this.

37:26.285 --> 37:29.372
Whatever happens between our two families,
the Number Ones should orchestrate it.

37:31.457 --> 37:33.125
I'm Number Seven, actually.

37:35.211 --> 37:36.671
Well, then somebody screwed up.

37:38.839 --> 37:41.217
My brothers think
you're gonna come after us.

37:43.469 --> 37:44.637
I don't want a war.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.264
We've lost enough.

37:46.347 --> 37:48.432
Then you shouldn't have
attacked us in our own house.

37:50.810 --> 37:51.769
Look,

37:52.812 --> 37:54.480
this isn't personal,

37:54.563 --> 37:57.024
but we're the only superhero game in town.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.734
We have this place under complete control.

37:58.818 --> 38:00.486
But if your people
start taking shots at us,

38:00.569 --> 38:02.655
it will give the sheep ideas.

38:02.738 --> 38:03.698
We won't. That's--

38:03.781 --> 38:06.325
And I'm just supposed
to take your word on that?

38:06.409 --> 38:07.827
For your whole family?

38:09.328 --> 38:11.289
You're not even their Number One.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.084
And I'm sorry, but I can't risk that.

38:15.793 --> 38:18.963
So if you came here to beg me
not to make the next move…

38:22.300 --> 38:24.010
I came here to tell you mine.

38:25.970 --> 38:29.056
Tomorrow morning,
when your busloads of fans show up,

38:29.140 --> 38:31.726
I'm gonna be there on your front lawn,

38:32.852 --> 38:36.105
and I'm gonna call you out for a fight,
just you and me.

38:36.689 --> 38:38.357
[scoffs]

38:38.441 --> 38:39.275
Why?

38:40.735 --> 38:42.361
Because your team is good.

38:44.780 --> 38:46.032
Better than mine, maybe.

38:46.115 --> 38:47.241
[electricity crackles]

38:47.325 --> 38:48.451
[low rumbling]

38:48.534 --> 38:51.120
But I don't think
you're better than me, Marcus.

38:51.203 --> 38:53.581
[ominous string music playing]

38:53.664 --> 38:57.209
I ended the world twice.

38:58.252 --> 38:59.295
And you?

39:00.254 --> 39:02.131
You're just meat in spandex.

39:03.924 --> 39:06.927
And I bet you don't want
the whole world watching

39:07.011 --> 39:08.554
when I prove that to you.

39:08.637 --> 39:11.223
[cup and saucer clattering]

39:22.735 --> 39:24.570
What do you really want, Vanya?

39:25.905 --> 39:28.574
You have something I need,
and I want it back.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.831
[suspenseful music swelling]

39:35.915 --> 39:37.083
[cawing]

39:38.417 --> 39:40.836
[cawing]

39:43.255 --> 39:45.800
[cawing]

39:53.557 --> 39:55.184
He's making a deal with them.

39:55.684 --> 39:56.727
I'll handle it.

40:09.365 --> 40:13.411
[Klaus] You should try chewing.
You might actually taste the food.

40:13.494 --> 40:14.662
I haven't eaten in days.

40:14.745 --> 40:16.956
-[light jazz playing in background]
-What's wrong?

40:17.039 --> 40:18.749
-You look happy.
-[Five] I am plenty happy.

40:18.833 --> 40:21.335
Had a nap and a shvitz.
What does a man need?

40:21.419 --> 40:23.337
Brothers who don't eat like barn animals?

40:26.006 --> 40:28.592
So I've been thinking
through our little timeline snafu,

40:28.676 --> 40:32.304
and I'm pleased to report
that in my professional, expert opinion,

40:32.388 --> 40:33.889
we are totally in the clear.

40:33.973 --> 40:35.307
-Awesome!
-Huh!

40:35.391 --> 40:36.308
-Great.
-Yeah.

40:36.392 --> 40:38.686
-So everything's totally fine?
-More or less.

40:38.769 --> 40:42.106
I mean, there is one… small thing.

40:42.189 --> 40:43.941
It's nothing we can't manage.

40:47.236 --> 40:48.779
So spit it out, Boomer!

40:48.863 --> 40:51.115
Fine, Diego, it's like this.

40:51.198 --> 40:55.494
Dad didn't adopt us as babies,
but those babies still existed here.

40:55.578 --> 40:56.495
Aww!

40:56.579 --> 40:58.956
We just grew up in different places
with different people.

40:59.039 --> 40:59.957
So?

41:00.541 --> 41:02.334
So where are they now?

41:02.418 --> 41:05.588
Odds are, we each have
identical versions of ourselves

41:05.671 --> 41:09.175
walking around out there,
living completely different lives.

41:10.050 --> 41:11.051
[gasps]

41:12.511 --> 41:14.430
-Our doppelgängers!
-That's a made-up word.

41:14.513 --> 41:16.682
No, no! I learned all about this in Texas.

41:16.765 --> 41:18.726
Tell him about
the paranoid psychosis, Five.

41:18.809 --> 41:21.520
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I thought you said this wasn't a problem.

41:21.604 --> 41:25.274
Okay, yes, technically, if you're near
your doppel for long, you'll go insane.

41:25.357 --> 41:27.234
-So, if you see your other self--
-Kill them.

41:27.318 --> 41:28.819
-Sleep with them.
-Avoid them.

41:28.903 --> 41:30.279
-What is wrong with you?
-Come on.

41:30.362 --> 41:32.531
As if you wouldn't climb Luther Mountain.

41:32.615 --> 41:36.285
Wait. How are we supposed to guarantee
we don't cross paths with ourselves?

41:36.368 --> 41:38.496
Easy. We're the Benetton ad
of superheroes,

41:38.579 --> 41:41.790
born all around the world
until Dad brought us here,

41:41.874 --> 41:43.250
which he no longer did.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.794
Doppels probably aren't even
in the same time zone as us.

41:45.878 --> 41:46.921
That's true.

41:47.004 --> 41:48.506
-Yeah.
-Would you pass the moo shu?

41:49.673 --> 41:50.549
[Klaus] I don't know.

41:50.633 --> 41:54.720
Doesn't it seem kind of rude that Dad
unadopting us didn't change anything?

41:54.803 --> 41:56.013
-I'm offended.
-Hold up.

41:56.096 --> 41:58.265
-[Five] I never said that, Klaus.
-I'll be right back.

41:58.349 --> 42:00.601
[Klaus] How are we gonna know
where it changed?

42:05.773 --> 42:09.151
[ominous string music playing]

42:13.739 --> 42:15.741
[ominous music swells]

42:15.824 --> 42:16.784
Hello, lover.

42:18.285 --> 42:19.703
Holy shit.

42:21.580 --> 42:22.873
You really came back.

42:22.957 --> 42:24.166
You miss me already?

42:24.875 --> 42:26.001
That's too bad.

42:26.544 --> 42:29.672
I'm not here to stick around.
I'm just doing a quick little drop-off.

42:30.172 --> 42:31.006
Of what?

42:32.132 --> 42:33.175
Our son.

42:33.259 --> 42:35.010
[Lila] Diego, meet Stan.

42:36.387 --> 42:37.846
Say hello, Stanley!

42:37.930 --> 42:39.056
Hello, Stanley.

42:39.139 --> 42:40.224
Wait. What?

42:40.766 --> 42:43.561
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, this is--

42:43.644 --> 42:44.728
[Lila murmurs]

42:47.064 --> 42:50.276
Hey, this is a… It's a joke, right?

42:50.359 --> 42:52.486
That your boys can swim fast?
Yeah. [chuckles]

42:52.570 --> 42:53.862
Joke's on me there.

42:53.946 --> 42:55.864
I've had Stan for 12 years.

42:57.199 --> 42:59.368
-[bell dings]
-It's time for you to do your part.

42:59.451 --> 43:00.703
Have fun bonding.

43:01.328 --> 43:02.413
Be good for Mommy.

43:07.585 --> 43:08.711
[Stan] So…

43:10.170 --> 43:11.255
Do you got any food?

43:13.882 --> 43:15.884
[energy thrumming]

43:18.429 --> 43:19.305
Grace.

43:20.806 --> 43:22.433
Have you seen a briefcase?

43:23.434 --> 43:25.269
[Grace hums]

43:25.352 --> 43:26.478
[Marcus] What are you doing?

43:28.981 --> 43:30.024
Worshiping.

43:31.317 --> 43:32.818
[Grace continues humming]

43:38.407 --> 43:41.660
[energy pulsing]

43:43.829 --> 43:44.663
Holy shit.

43:47.625 --> 43:48.584
Yes.

43:49.376 --> 43:50.419
It is holy.

43:55.132 --> 43:56.550
Isn't it beautiful?

43:58.135 --> 44:00.763
Grace, what is this thing?

44:01.722 --> 44:02.681
A miracle.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.935
I can't make out what it's saying.
Can you?

44:08.896 --> 44:11.940
[pulsing continues]

44:13.108 --> 44:14.401
It's just noise.

44:14.485 --> 44:15.903
No, Marcus.

44:15.986 --> 44:18.030
It's a message from God.

44:18.530 --> 44:19.406
Listen.

44:22.743 --> 44:23.744
[gasps]

44:26.497 --> 44:27.623
I hear it.

44:27.706 --> 44:29.249
[shockwave pulsing]

44:35.255 --> 44:37.007
You mind your manners.

44:37.091 --> 44:40.469
[intense orchestral music playing]

44:50.229 --> 44:51.146
[whimpers]

44:55.526 --> 44:59.113
[screaming]

45:05.285 --> 45:08.122
[Five] The point is, we did it.
We saved the world.

45:08.205 --> 45:09.623
We stopped the apocalypse.

45:10.207 --> 45:12.292
And made it home safe in time for dinner.

45:12.376 --> 45:14.294
So whatever Dad changed,

45:14.378 --> 45:16.922
whatever timeline we're in now…

45:17.005 --> 45:18.006
[whistling]

45:18.090 --> 45:19.216
…we can handle it.

45:20.342 --> 45:21.343
We won.

45:24.722 --> 45:25.597
We won.

45:26.098 --> 45:27.141
[Klaus] Yeah.

45:27.224 --> 45:28.308
-All right.
-All right.

45:28.392 --> 45:31.311
[intense orchestral music swelling]

45:38.777 --> 45:42.698
[rock violin music playing]
