WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:03.922
- JESSIE: Who wants
- fresh raspberries?

00:04.046 --> 00:06.382
Earlier, I saw Emma

00:06.383 --> 00:08.718
balancing one of these

00:04.046 --> 00:08.718
on the tip of her nose.

00:08.843 --> 00:10.533
That wasn't a raspberry.

00:10.534 --> 00:12.221
She has a zit the size

00:08.843 --> 00:12.221
of a Chihuahua.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.181
(ZURI LAUGHS)

00:14.306 --> 00:16.705
Not a raspberry?

00:16.706 --> 00:19.103
Then my enthusiastic applause

00:14.306 --> 00:19.103
must have confused her.

00:20.772 --> 00:22.586
No one notice me,

00:22.587 --> 00:24.400
no one notice me...

00:24.650 --> 00:25.818
That probably didn't help.

00:28.738 --> 00:30.782
It's just a little zit.

00:30.783 --> 00:32.825
How bad could it be?

00:28.738 --> 00:32.825
(GASPS) Oh!

00:32.951 --> 00:34.223
Look at the size

00:34.224 --> 00:35.494
of that... Cloud!

00:35.620 --> 00:37.080
It looks like my nose

00:37.081 --> 00:38.539
is growing a nose.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.625
(SCREAMING)

00:40.750 --> 00:42.377
Look, I'm even

00:42.378 --> 00:44.003
scaring children!

00:45.129 --> 00:46.714
No, that's not you.

00:46.839 --> 00:48.321
That's something truly

00:48.322 --> 00:49.801
horrifying, and it's

00:46.839 --> 00:49.801
headed this way.

00:49.926 --> 00:51.011
Jessie.

00:51.012 --> 00:52.094
Agatha.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.200
I see you're still

00:54.201 --> 00:56.181
taking care of

00:52.219 --> 00:56.181
these hideous children.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.643
And I see your tooth

00:58.644 --> 00:59.685
is still trying to escape.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.484
Is that the nasty nanny

01:06.485 --> 01:07.735
who tried to get Jessie

01:05.232 --> 01:07.735
fired

01:07.860 --> 01:09.821
- with her Toddler
- Tattler blog?

01:09.946 --> 01:11.844
Mmm-hmm.

01:11.845 --> 01:13.741
Someone should drop

01:09.946 --> 01:13.741
a house on that.

01:13.866 --> 01:15.723
Agatha, please.

01:15.724 --> 01:17.578
I just got to town.

01:13.866 --> 01:17.578
I have nowhere to stay.

01:17.703 --> 01:19.581
There is just not

01:19.582 --> 01:21.457
enough room for you.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.022
But, Agatha, your

01:23.023 --> 01:24.460
apartment is huge.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.753
I'm talking about New York!

01:31.884 --> 01:34.053
Hi, I'm Jessie.

01:34.178 --> 01:35.304
I'm Angela.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.619
I too have gone face

01:36.620 --> 01:37.807
to mole with Agatha.

01:38.891 --> 01:40.810
Or as I call her...

01:40.935 --> 01:42.749
Well, I can't tell you

01:42.750 --> 01:44.563
what I call her because

01:40.935 --> 01:44.563
there are children present.

01:44.689 --> 01:46.565
- Agatha's always been
- a bit harsh.

01:46.691 --> 01:48.130
And I'd know better

01:48.131 --> 01:49.568

01:46.691 --> 01:49.568

Oh, nice to meet you.

By the way, Jessie,

03:10.858 --> 03:13.652
what has two thumbs

03:13.778 --> 03:15.530
and is looking forward

03:15.531 --> 03:17.281
to our date? This guy!

(LAUGHING)

03:18.908 --> 03:20.701
That never gets old.

03:20.702 --> 03:22.494
So what do you

03:18.908 --> 03:22.494
have planned?

03:22.620 --> 03:24.643
It's a super secret.

03:24.644 --> 03:26.665
On a totally unrelated topic,

03:26.791 --> 03:28.084
I need to know what size

03:28.085 --> 03:29.376
bowling shoe you wear.

03:30.169 --> 03:31.754
Six and a half.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.966
Okay, fine, an eight. Narrow!

03:38.719 --> 03:40.096
Mmm, this pasta

03:40.097 --> 03:41.472
is superb!

03:41.597 --> 03:42.744
Angela, it's such

03:42.745 --> 03:43.891
a pleasure cooking

03:41.597 --> 03:43.891
for someone

03:44.016 --> 03:46.769
who appreciates fine cuisine.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.918
Feeding the mob around here

03:48.919 --> 03:50.940
is like lobbing mackerel

03:46.894 --> 03:50.940
to performing penguins.

03:51.732 --> 03:52.984
Luke Ross is trying

03:52.985 --> 03:54.234

Go read a book.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.233
Sorry, Angela,

04:13.234 --> 04:14.546
I didn't warn you

04:14.672 --> 04:16.190
- that being in this house
- could be hazardous.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.446
Oh, I'm used to danger.

04:17.447 --> 04:18.676
I grew up with Agatha.

04:18.801 --> 04:20.156
I was supposed

04:20.158 --> 04:21.512
to be born first,

04:18.801 --> 04:21.512
but she grabbed my cord

04:21.637 --> 04:22.847
and then yanked

04:22.848 --> 04:24.056
me back in.

04:24.182 --> 04:26.121
So, I'm guessing

04:26.122 --> 04:28.060
you're an outie.

04:28.186 --> 04:30.355
Jessie, you're so lucky

04:30.356 --> 04:32.523
to be living in such

04:28.186 --> 04:32.523
a beautiful home

04:32.648 --> 04:34.441
with such wonderful children.

04:34.566 --> 04:37.195
Now, if you'll excuse me,

04:37.196 --> 04:39.822
I have to go find a comfy

04:34.566 --> 04:39.822
park bench to sleep on.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.303
Oh, Angela, I can't

04:41.304 --> 04:42.658
let you sleep

04:39.947 --> 04:42.658
on a park bench.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.556
Oh, do you have

04:44.557 --> 04:46.328
a refrigerator box

04:42.783 --> 04:46.328
I could borrow?

04:46.453 --> 04:48.706
That would be lovely.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.892
- No, I mean, I'd have - to check
with my bosses, - But I'm sure

04:50.916 --> 04:52.251
They wouldn't mind

04:52.252 --> 04:53.585
if you stayed here

04:50.916 --> 04:53.585
with us for a few days.

04:53.711 --> 04:54.796
That would be brilliant!

04:54.797 --> 04:55.880
Are you sure it would be

04:53.711 --> 04:55.880
okay with them?

04:56.005 --> 04:57.840
Oh, absolutely.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.905
Considering they let

04:59.906 --> 05:01.844
Jessie live here, the bar

04:57.965 --> 05:01.844
isn't exactly set high.

05:03.679 --> 05:04.679
(CHUCKLES)

05:04.763 --> 05:06.074
- We kid like that
- all the time.

05:06.098 --> 05:07.099
I wasn't kidding!

05:12.938 --> 05:14.982
Emma Ross for a facial.

05:15.107 --> 05:16.692
Okay, Emma. I promise you,

05:16.693 --> 05:18.277
this will pummel your

05:15.107 --> 05:18.277
pimple problem.

05:18.402 --> 05:20.008
Thanks, Jessie.

05:20.009 --> 05:21.613
You should make an

05:18.402 --> 05:21.613
appointment, too.

05:21.739 --> 05:23.428
Maybe they could do

05:23.429 --> 05:25.117
something about that.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.603
A day spa? In your building?

05:30.604 --> 05:33.084
What next, a water park

05:28.120 --> 05:33.084
on the roof?

05:33.209 --> 05:35.233
Oh, look. Ravi teaches

05:35.234 --> 05:37.255
this yoga class to make

05:33.209 --> 05:37.255
video game money.

05:37.379 --> 05:39.757
All right, ladies,

05:39.758 --> 05:42.134
our next position

05:37.379 --> 05:42.134
is upward dog,

05:42.260 --> 05:43.886
but my assistant

05:43.887 --> 05:45.512
and I like to call it

05:42.260 --> 05:45.512
upward lizard.

05:47.723 --> 05:48.891
Let's try it.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.493
- Okay. But watch out
- for Ravi's assistant.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.358
- When he adjusts you,
- he leaves teeth marks.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.295
Our next position

05:56.296 --> 05:58.109
is called the eagle pose.

05:58.234 --> 05:59.965
And it takes

05:59.966 --> 06:01.695
a little bit

05:58.234 --> 06:01.695
of talon-t.

06:01.820 --> 06:02.820

06:02.905 --> 06:04.949

06:10.454 --> 06:12.054

- blowing on me.

06:12.123 --> 06:13.520
Don't worry, Jessie.

06:13.521 --> 06:14.917
You'll get the

06:12.123 --> 06:14.917
hang of it.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.586

06:16.587 --> 06:18.129
I can't get over

06:15.042 --> 06:18.129

06:19.715 --> 06:21.173
My sister is a total witch?

06:21.299 --> 06:22.613
Exactly!

06:22.614 --> 06:23.926

06:21.299 --> 06:23.926
milk, and eye of newt.

- From last night's dinner.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.216
Oh, shut up!

07:09.138 --> 07:10.448
- Bertram!
- Get the lunches ready.

The kids...

07:11.932 --> 07:15.102
Got down here really fast.

07:15.227 --> 07:16.997
- Do we have a fireman's
- pole I don't know about?

07:17.021 --> 07:18.418
Jessie, since you hadn't

07:18.419 --> 07:19.815
woken yet, I thought

07:17.021 --> 07:19.815
I'd step in and make

07:19.940 --> 07:22.109
the kids breakfast.

07:22.110 --> 07:24.278
I hope you don't mind.

07:24.403 --> 07:25.885
No, no, that's fine.

07:25.886 --> 07:27.365
Thank you.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.450
Uh, Emma, while I was

07:29.451 --> 07:31.410
asleep, did you rob

07:27.489 --> 07:31.410
a stagecoach?

07:32.286 --> 07:33.287
(ALL SHUDDER)

07:33.912 --> 07:36.541
Yikes! I mean,

07:36.542 --> 07:39.168
what's up, Emma?

07:39.293 --> 07:40.337
This is from the facial

07:40.338 --> 07:41.379
you recommended.

07:41.503 --> 07:42.963
My face looks like

07:42.964 --> 07:44.423
a baboon's butt.

07:44.548 --> 07:45.904
Well, yeah!

07:45.905 --> 07:47.259
Oh, but today

07:44.548 --> 07:47.259
it has a rash.

07:49.220 --> 07:51.097
Emma, you are beautiful,

07:51.098 --> 07:52.973
as always.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.371
But I am trying to eat,

07:54.372 --> 07:55.642
so if you could

07:53.098 --> 07:55.642
just turn away...

07:57.186 --> 07:58.813
Don't you worry, Emma.

07:58.814 --> 08:00.439
Use this organic cream

07:57.186 --> 08:00.439
I made for you.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.128
It will cleanse your skin,

08:02.129 --> 08:03.650
and your colon.

08:04.818 --> 08:05.903
Thank you?

Zuri, you can't

08:10.096 --> 08:12.076
eat ice cream

08:08.113 --> 08:12.076
for breakfast!

08:12.201 --> 08:14.370
But it's in a waffle cone.

08:15.579 --> 08:16.997
Hope you don't mind, Jessie.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.166
When she eats it,

08:18.167 --> 08:19.208
her eyes light up.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.001
- Yeah, that's called
- sugar shock.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.253
Okay, everyone,

08:22.254 --> 08:23.379
let's get going.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.065
- Oh, don't worry, love.
- I'll take them down - To the bus.

08:25.089 --> 08:26.841
That's okay, Angela.

08:26.842 --> 08:28.592
I'm the nanny,

08:25.089 --> 08:28.592
that's my job.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.636
Don't be silly.

08:30.637 --> 08:32.554
Right now, your job

08:28.717 --> 08:32.554
is to just sit and relax.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.119
- But that's already
- Bertram's job.

08:35.974 --> 08:37.893
- I'll teach you
- everything I know.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.479
All right, children,

08:39.480 --> 08:40.938
time for school!

08:41.063 --> 08:43.441
(ALL WHISTLING)

08:47.945 --> 08:49.864
Uh, okay! Have a great

08:49.865 --> 08:51.782
day. I'll take you

08:47.945 --> 08:51.782
to the park later.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.534
Actually, Nanny Angela

08:53.535 --> 08:55.160
has offered to take us

08:51.907 --> 08:55.160
rolling on skates.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.914
"Nanny Angela"?

08:59.039 --> 09:00.479
Jessie, thanks to you,

09:00.480 --> 09:01.917
I finally feel like

08:59.039 --> 09:01.917
I have a sister,

09:02.042 --> 09:03.732
and not one who shaves

09:03.733 --> 09:05.421
my head in the middle

09:02.042 --> 09:05.421
of the night.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.924
- Let's go, my little
- ducklings!

09:09.049 --> 09:10.489
She calls us her ducklings.

09:10.490 --> 09:11.927
It's our thing.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.679
(ALL QUACKING)

09:19.101 --> 09:20.561
Bertram, do you think

09:20.562 --> 09:22.020
the kids like Angela

09:19.101 --> 09:22.020
better than me?

09:22.146 --> 09:24.732
Oh, don't be silly.

09:24.733 --> 09:27.318
We all like Angela

09:22.146 --> 09:27.318
better than you.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.194
(QUACKS)

09:36.034 --> 09:37.933
Hello, Jessie.

09:37.934 --> 09:39.830
You're looking

09:36.034 --> 09:39.830
a bit glum.

09:39.955 --> 09:41.624
Well, actually...

09:41.625 --> 09:43.292
Oh, I don't care why.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.336
I'm just enjoying it.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.901
As usual, you're just

09:48.902 --> 09:50.715
a little ray of hate.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.970
So, I've noticed

09:53.971 --> 09:55.846
on my BuddyPage

09:52.092 --> 09:55.846
that my sister Angela

09:55.971 --> 09:56.847
is staying with you.

09:56.972 --> 09:58.453
You have buddies?

09:58.454 --> 09:59.933
Of course.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.540
Well, buddy.

10:01.541 --> 10:03.020
And 600 pending.

10:04.021 --> 10:07.358
I wouldn't hold my breath.

10:07.483 --> 10:08.797
And for the record,

10:08.798 --> 10:10.110
your sister has been a

10:07.483 --> 10:10.110
wonderful house guest.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.863
Oh, she won't be

10:11.864 --> 10:13.489
a guest for long.

10:10.235 --> 10:13.489
Be warned, Jessie!

10:13.613 --> 10:15.303
Angela always gets what

10:15.304 --> 10:16.992
she wants, and right now,

10:13.613 --> 10:16.992
she wants a cushy job

10:17.117 --> 10:19.954
working for a celebrity

10:19.955 --> 10:22.789
couple in a swanky Upper

10:17.117 --> 10:22.789
West Side penthouse!

10:22.914 --> 10:24.555
- She put all that
- in her status update?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.815
No, you silly git!

10:26.816 --> 10:28.504
That's what Angela does.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.006
She's evil, I tell you! Evil!

10:31.131 --> 10:32.883
- Oh, no. No.
- You are the evil one.

10:33.008 --> 10:34.384
You are the Darth Vader

10:34.385 --> 10:35.760
to her Luke Skywalker.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.283
But at least Darth Vader had

10:37.284 --> 10:38.680
the decency to wear a mask.

10:38.805 --> 10:39.973
Fine, but let me

10:39.974 --> 10:41.141
ask you this.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.123
Is she ingratiating

10:43.124 --> 10:44.978
herself into the family?

10:45.103 --> 10:47.377
Flattering people?

10:47.378 --> 10:49.649
Making herself

10:45.103 --> 10:49.649
indispensable?

10:49.774 --> 10:52.444
Well, sorta-ish...

10:52.570 --> 10:53.738
She's the reason

10:53.739 --> 10:54.905
I left England!

10:55.030 --> 10:56.907
- I was the nanny
- to Lord Taylor.

10:57.032 --> 10:58.825
- Angela came to visit
- for the weekend,

10:58.950 --> 11:00.261
- Next thing you know,
- I was sacked!

11:00.285 --> 11:01.370
You got fired?

11:01.495 --> 11:02.559
No, they threw me out

11:02.560 --> 11:03.622
in a sack!

11:07.959 --> 11:09.127
Hey, Jessie!

11:09.128 --> 11:10.295
Hey, Tony.

11:10.421 --> 11:11.693
Look, I've got some good

11:11.694 --> 11:12.964
news and some bad news.

11:13.090 --> 11:14.484
- Which do you want
- to hear first?

11:14.508 --> 11:15.948
Actually, I could really

11:15.949 --> 11:17.386
use some good news.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.826
Oh. Well, now that

11:19.827 --> 11:22.140
I think about it,

11:17.511 --> 11:22.140
it's really just bad news.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.603
Look, is it okay if

11:25.604 --> 11:26.895
we take a rain check

11:24.309 --> 11:26.895
on our date tonight?

11:27.020 --> 11:28.648
Why? Did the bowling alley

11:28.649 --> 11:30.274
run out of shoe freshener?

11:31.316 --> 11:32.401
Whoa, shoe freshener?

11:32.526 --> 11:34.247
- What, are we bowling
- at the White House?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.301
No, Angela asked me

11:36.302 --> 11:37.739
to help her pick up

11:34.861 --> 11:37.739
her stuff.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.387
Angela? Why do you have

11:39.388 --> 11:40.909
to help Angela tonight?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.929
- Well, she can't pay
- to store her stuff anymore

11:42.953 --> 11:44.764
- And they're gonna
- throw it all out tomorrow.

11:44.788 --> 11:45.789
Huh.

11:45.790 --> 11:46.790
She said you'd be

11:44.788 --> 11:46.790
okay with it.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.459
She did?

11:48.584 --> 11:49.919
Yeah, she went on and on

11:49.920 --> 11:51.253
about how understanding

11:51.378 --> 11:52.484
and sweet and generous

11:52.485 --> 11:53.589
you are.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.299
Well, that does sound like me.

11:56.550 --> 11:57.717
Okay, go for it.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.637
- Hey, where's
- she moving, anyway?

11:59.761 --> 12:00.471
Into your place.

12:00.596 --> 12:03.307
What? That's news to me.

12:03.432 --> 12:04.933
- Well, then I do
- have good news!

12:08.019 --> 12:10.335
Bertram, why is

12:10.336 --> 12:12.650
Angela moving in

12:08.019 --> 12:12.650
to our penthouse?

12:12.774 --> 12:14.401
Um, because it would be

12:14.402 --> 12:16.027
odd if the live-in maid

12:12.774 --> 12:16.027
didn't live in.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.214
- Morgan and Christina
- approved it.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.552
Wait, they know

12:19.553 --> 12:20.865
about Angela?

12:20.991 --> 12:23.223
Yeah, the kids have been

12:23.224 --> 12:25.454
texting them nonstop

12:20.991 --> 12:25.454
about how much they love her.

12:25.579 --> 12:26.726
And besides, I need

12:26.727 --> 12:27.872
some help around here.

12:27.998 --> 12:29.437
Why? You need someone

12:29.438 --> 12:30.875
to spot you while you nap?

12:31.001 --> 12:33.504
Yes. Sometimes my head

12:33.505 --> 12:36.006
falls forward and

12:31.001 --> 12:36.006
I wake up with a crick.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.009
(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

12:41.011 --> 12:42.492
Hey, guys. So, did you

12:42.493 --> 12:43.972
have fun roller skating?

12:44.097 --> 12:46.058
Yes. The two minutes

12:46.059 --> 12:48.018
I was not facedown

12:44.097 --> 12:48.018
on the concrete

12:48.143 --> 12:48.810
were quite enjoyable.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.104
Awesome!

12:51.229 --> 12:53.023
Angela's the greatest.

12:53.024 --> 12:54.816
She taught me

12:51.229 --> 12:54.816
how to do this.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.862
- It's cooler when
- you're on wheels.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.906
And look! Thanks

13:00.907 --> 13:02.824
to Angela's cream,

12:58.987 --> 13:02.824
my face is back to normal.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.139
You say that like

13:04.140 --> 13:05.327
it's a good thing.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.121
Oh! And check this out.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.237
- What was that?
- I got him that.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.837
He was just so sad

13:14.838 --> 13:16.380
when you took away his car.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.550
Angela is a giver.

13:21.635 --> 13:22.929
Great! Great news!

All great news.

13:24.346 --> 13:28.559
I hear you're moving in.

13:28.684 --> 13:29.727
Yes! It's all

13:29.728 --> 13:30.769
so exciting and it

13:28.684 --> 13:30.769
came out of nowhere!

I cannot wait until

13:39.550 --> 13:40.612
tomorrow morning.

13:40.738 --> 13:42.927
Angela says for breakfast

13:42.928 --> 13:45.116
she is going to make

13:40.738 --> 13:45.116
toad in the hole.

13:45.242 --> 13:47.015
Which I hope does not

13:47.016 --> 13:48.787
involve an actual toad.

made you a delicious

13:53.272 --> 13:54.501
gone out and messed up

All of our alarm

13:55.671 --> 13:56.712
clocks worked.

13:56.836 --> 13:57.983
Maybe the power just

13:57.984 --> 13:59.130
went out in your room.

14:01.759 --> 14:03.698
Or maybe Angela

14:03.699 --> 14:05.637
unplugged my alarm clock

14:01.759 --> 14:05.637
in the middle of the night!

14:06.096 --> 14:08.286
Evil Agatha was

14:08.287 --> 14:10.475
trying to help me?

14:11.268 --> 14:12.268
Huh.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.392
I did not see that coming.

14:17.775 --> 14:19.775
- Apparently, I don't see
- a lot of things coming.

Peek-a-boo!

Oh, don't worry.

14:34.563 --> 14:36.042
It'll wear off.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.877
- It might help to think
- about puppies.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.112
So, Agatha, remember

14:43.113 --> 14:45.260
what you told me about

14:40.964 --> 14:45.260
your sister and how

14:45.385 --> 14:46.595
she was all evil?

14:46.720 --> 14:48.430
Well, funny story...

14:48.555 --> 14:49.744
You didn't believe me

14:49.745 --> 14:50.932
and now you realize

14:48.555 --> 14:50.932
I was right. The end.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.227
- Your sister is
- stealing my life!

14:54.352 --> 14:55.771
Please help me get rid of her.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.647
I would be delighted to,

14:57.648 --> 14:59.399
except for one

small thing.

14:59.524 --> 15:00.525
I don't particularly

15:00.526 --> 15:01.526
like you.

15:01.652 --> 15:03.570
- But you don't like
- Angela even more.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.301
And the sister of my enemy

15:05.302 --> 15:06.906
is my... Or is it the enemy

15:03.695 --> 15:06.906
of my sister...

- The evil twin sister
- of my enemy is...

Is the girl that...

15:10.224 --> 15:11.453
You know what I'm saying.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.580
Yes. I was right,

15:13.581 --> 15:15.582
and I told you so.

15:11.578 --> 15:15.582
Ta-ta.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.355
Please, is there any way

15:17.356 --> 15:19.002
I could get you to help me?

15:19.127 --> 15:22.152
Well, you could appeal

15:22.153 --> 15:25.175
to my better nature.
