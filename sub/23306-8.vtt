40:36.767 --> 40:38.269
<i>I'm terrified right now,</i>

40:38.352 --> 40:40.938
because my canvas
has tissue paper skin.

40:41.021 --> 40:43.315
Oh, my God.
This is crazy.

40:43.399 --> 40:44.358
{\an3}- Daniel, you did
an unfinished tattoo.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.402
{\an1}- I [bleep] finished.
Look at the tattoo.

40:46.485 --> 40:48.696
It's [bleep] finished.
- Bro...

40:48.779 --> 40:50.698
You're blind, Steve.
- It doesn't look finished.

40:50.781 --> 40:51.866
- You're blind!

40:51.949 --> 40:52.575
You keep voting me down.
It ain't gonna work.
