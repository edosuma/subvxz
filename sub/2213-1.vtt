<i>Early Winter, 2005</i>

01:12.448 --> 01:13.741
Another bottle please

01:19.789 --> 01:20.539
I'm sorry

01:22.208 --> 01:23.501
Where's my drink?

01:26.212 --> 01:28.339
Ma'am, where's the remote?

02:30.985 --> 02:32.236
Drop the knife!

02:36.073 --> 02:38.367
Drop it, you fuck!

02:41.162 --> 02:43.414
Please... don't let him kill me...

02:46.250 --> 02:50.713
Her blood is on your hand now

02:53.716 --> 02:55.843
Ma'am!

02:55.843 --> 02:56.594
Towel!

03:44.475 --> 03:45.517
Stop, you fuck!

04:18.968 --> 04:20.427
Motherfucker!

04:41.699 --> 04:42.908
Stop!

05:18.277 --> 05:20.404
Put your fucking hands
in the air!

05:33.500 --> 05:35.252
That's enough

05:37.004 --> 05:38.422
Turn around!

05:44.803 --> 05:46.180
On your knees!

05:46.263 --> 05:47.681
Hands on your back!

07:01.296 --> 07:03.298
I'll... kill you...

07:12.808 --> 07:15.519
You're scared, aren't you?

07:15.894 --> 07:17.354
You killed her too, didn't you?

07:19.231 --> 07:20.607
What did you do?

07:22.151 --> 07:24.695
Answer me, motherfucker!

07:26.155 --> 07:30.784
I should slit
your mother's throat next

07:36.123 --> 07:37.207
No, not yet

07:37.624 --> 07:40.878
I have big plans
for you later

08:15.412 --> 08:16.705
15 years ago

08:17.748 --> 08:19.541
after killing 10 women

08:20.918 --> 08:24.630
the suspect disappeared
into this dark alley

08:25.422 --> 08:29.384
<i>His statute of limitations express today</i>

08:30.427 --> 08:35.265
<i>We met up with the lead detective
on the case Lt. Choi Hyung-gu</i>

08:36.642 --> 08:41.938
<i>Sir, how about a word to the suspect
who may be watching now</i>

08:44.149 --> 08:46.944
<i>There 3 one thing
I want to tell you</i>

08:47.819 --> 08:49.613
<i>please stay alive</i>

08:49.821 --> 08:53.200
Korean dicks are just glorified,
low-level hoodlums

08:56.954 --> 08:59.540
I was watching that

08:59.915 --> 09:00.457
Huh?

09:01.166 --> 09:01.792
Buddy!

09:04.628 --> 09:08.048
How dare you switch the channel
when I'm on it!

09:08.632 --> 09:10.842
Lt. Choi, please leave

09:10.968 --> 09:14.846
I can't see you this way any more

09:15.472 --> 09:16.431
Go

09:16.765 --> 09:17.641
Please

10:17.159 --> 10:18.410
Hey, Hyun-sik

10:18.660 --> 10:23.540
<i>Do you remember
how many titles I defended?</i>

10:24.833 --> 10:27.628
Yeah, 6 Asian titles

10:29.630 --> 10:35.177
I wanted to win World Championship
and place the belt on mom's grave

10:35.552 --> 10:37.554
Hyun-sik, are you home now?

10:37.929 --> 10:39.181
Let's talk in person

10:40.474 --> 10:45.437
I was pretty much an orphan
after what happened to mom

10:47.272 --> 10:49.775
You treated me like your real brother

10:54.196 --> 10:55.530
I won't forget it

10:55.656 --> 10:58.700
Hyun-sik!

10:59.910 --> 11:01.161
Jung Hyun-sik!

11:02.704 --> 11:03.914
Hyun-sik!

11:24.101 --> 11:26.144
What are you doing up there!

11:28.105 --> 11:31.775
How'd your mom feel if she saw you
like this in heaven?

11:32.693 --> 11:37.364
You have to see him suffer and die!
You can do this after that!

11:43.620 --> 11:46.915
I know how you feel,
so come down and let's talk

11:48.333 --> 11:52.045
Hyung-gu, I'm sorry...

11:52.462 --> 11:54.506
Hyun-sik!

12:26.496 --> 12:28.665
<i>Jung Hyun-sik, 1973-2005</i>

12:56.985 --> 13:01.031
<i>CONFESSION OF MURDER</i>

13:02.199 --> 13:05.035
<i>2 years later, late autumn, 2007</i>

13:16.713 --> 13:19.841
Hyung-gu! You got a call!

13:20.217 --> 13:21.593
<i>Answer your phone!</i>

13:24.346 --> 13:26.765
Still dead of the night!

13:26.890 --> 13:28.433
What? What time is it mom?

13:28.433 --> 13:31.978
I'm sick and tired of your drunken
stupor!

13:32.103 --> 13:33.605
Answer it!

13:40.737 --> 13:44.241
Gwang-su, I told you
I help mom on weekends

13:44.407 --> 13:46.910
new cases can wait until Monday!

13:47.410 --> 13:50.914
Help me with what,
you do nothing but sleep!

13:50.914 --> 13:53.250
When did I not help?
What?

13:53.250 --> 13:54.251
Turn what on?

13:54.835 --> 13:57.212
Lee Doo-suk, the author of
'Confession of Murder'

13:57.379 --> 14:02.175
revealed that he is the killer of an
unsolved serial killing case

14:02.259 --> 14:04.177
that shook the nation 17 years ago

14:04.177 --> 14:09.266
The press conference is already heating up
due to the fact that the writer confessed

14:09.266 --> 14:12.352
after the expiration of statute of limitations

14:13.520 --> 14:15.689
Lee Doo-suk is stepping in now

14:24.614 --> 14:29.202
Thank you everyone for coming
to the launching press conference

14:29.202 --> 14:34.082
This book was written to
sincerely repent for his crimes,

14:34.249 --> 14:37.377
so please refrain any offensive questions

14:40.380 --> 14:41.423
Yes?

14:44.342 --> 14:48.638
What's the point of confessing
after evading formal investigation,

14:49.347 --> 14:52.726
and committing the perfect murder?

14:53.476 --> 14:55.729
'The point of confessing'...

14:58.315 --> 15:00.317
It may be hard to believe...

15:02.027 --> 15:04.029
but I'd say it's out of guilt

15:04.988 --> 15:11.494
And I wish others
would share my guilt

15:11.578 --> 15:14.039
Guilt trip after all these years?

15:14.122 --> 15:16.124
What a load of shit

15:16.291 --> 15:18.376
Can you let him continue?

15:19.502 --> 15:21.838
Let's hear him out

15:22.297 --> 15:23.298
Mr. Lee!

15:24.215 --> 15:27.135
As you can see you'll be criticized
and chastised mercilessly,

15:27.636 --> 15:29.721
are you afraid of anything?

15:31.264 --> 15:37.020
My confession will bring immediate chaos,

15:39.648 --> 15:49.866
but I hope these ghastly cases
do not occur through this book

15:49.866 --> 15:51.785
You're a very handsome man

15:51.785 --> 15:54.412
How do you take care of your skin?

15:54.537 --> 15:56.164
That's the best you can do?

15:56.247 --> 15:59.668
We shouldn't allow
female reporters to question

15:59.834 --> 16:02.712
Is there a proof that you're the real killer?

16:03.254 --> 16:05.882
You'll find sufficient descriptions
of the murders in the book

16:07.884 --> 16:11.846
And Lt. Choi!

16:15.809 --> 16:18.019
<i>I guess he's not here today</i>

16:18.895 --> 16:22.065
<i>I'm sorry. . . for What I did to you</i>

16:22.482 --> 16:25.402
Honey, isn't he talking about you?

16:28.029 --> 16:31.950
The bullet that Lt. Choi fired,
is still inside me

16:36.162 --> 16:39.374
This is an x-ray of the slug

16:39.708 --> 16:42.210
Can you show us your bullet wound?

17:08.361 --> 17:11.448
It'll be distributed nationally tomorrow,

17:11.448 --> 17:14.659
and online reservation starts midnight today

17:14.659 --> 17:17.203
We wish for your glowing endorsement

17:30.300 --> 17:31.968
The site is overloaded
Please try again later

17:31.968 --> 17:34.345
Shit, I was gonna read for a change...

17:50.862 --> 17:54.032
Can you give us a comment?

17:54.115 --> 17:56.076
Tell us how you feel! Mr. Lee!

17:56.076 --> 17:57.452
How do you feel?

17:57.660 --> 18:00.497
Will you give me some room!

18:01.664 --> 18:04.709
Mr. Lee, why don't you repent tomorrow
when it's sunny?

18:04.709 --> 18:06.586
Did you pick today because of the rain?

18:06.878 --> 18:09.714
Let's just to this tomorrow!

18:09.714 --> 18:12.300
- Give me that umbrella!
- This is mine!

18:13.176 --> 18:18.348
Doctor! Doctor! How do you feel?!

18:18.348 --> 18:21.142
How do you feel?!

18:21.142 --> 18:23.103
A comment please!

18:26.689 --> 18:30.026
Please accept... my apology...

18:39.119 --> 18:40.578
Snap it!

18:43.706 --> 18:49.254
Mr. Lee! How do you feel now?
One comment please!

18:49.254 --> 18:50.380
Mr. Lee Doo-suk!

18:50.380 --> 18:52.382
Will you repent to remaining
families of the victims too?

18:54.217 --> 18:55.844
I'm stunned...

18:56.803 --> 19:01.766
So he's the real killer,
but no way to lock him up

19:02.058 --> 19:03.226
You sure about that?

19:03.852 --> 19:04.978
Will you take responsibility for it?

19:05.061 --> 19:08.565
I don't even co-sign for my dad,
why would I do that?

19:08.648 --> 19:09.858
I'm just saying

19:09.858 --> 19:10.942
Idiot...

19:10.942 --> 19:13.444
Don't you agree?
You were there too

19:13.570 --> 19:18.074
A fraud can't be this vivid
with the details, it's bulletproof

19:18.074 --> 19:20.743
Bulletproof?
Nothing's ever without holes

19:20.743 --> 19:22.579
You're talking about
the last missing case,

19:23.288 --> 19:25.623
that's probably not his work

19:25.623 --> 19:27.500
I thought this was a violent crime unit?

19:27.500 --> 19:31.671
When did it become a library?
It looks nice!

19:33.339 --> 19:35.967
Well, isn't this the tragic hero,
Mr. Choi?

19:36.968 --> 19:38.428
What's with you?

19:38.553 --> 19:40.597
You're a celebrity now, fucker

19:40.847 --> 19:43.933
In any case,
is that bastard Lee real deal?

19:43.933 --> 19:46.644
So what if he is,
we can't even lock him up anymore

19:46.644 --> 19:49.480
Lee Doo-suk may not be the killer, idiot!

19:49.480 --> 19:51.107
Look at his face

19:51.107 --> 19:52.525
does he look like a killer?

19:52.525 --> 19:55.028
Don't you smell something fishy?
Come on, sniff!

19:55.028 --> 19:57.030
I think I smell Chinese, sir

19:57.030 --> 19:58.281
Your meal's here!

19:58.281 --> 20:00.033
Did you wait for the cue?

20:00.617 --> 20:05.205
How could you eat Chinese
at a time like this?

20:05.622 --> 20:08.833
You can't figure out what's
what with an empty stomach, goddammit!

20:09.459 --> 20:10.710
What did you just say, asshole?!

20:10.710 --> 20:12.170
So we starve until the job's done?

20:12.295 --> 20:15.840
It's not like we can afford
anything other than Chinese anyway

20:17.383 --> 20:19.552
You're crawling up my ass lately

20:19.552 --> 20:22.222
I'd fire you, if you weren't
my Academy junior...

20:22.222 --> 20:24.974
I'm hungry.
Order us some too!

20:24.974 --> 20:30.480
Yo Chink, let's make another drop
3 noodles and plenty of radish

20:30.480 --> 20:33.316
You slutty whores,
get your own fucking radish!

20:33.316 --> 20:35.735
Look at this fucking asshole

20:35.735 --> 20:36.986
- I'll...
- Hey!

20:36.986 --> 20:38.488
What a fucking horror case

20:38.488 --> 20:42.367
Lt. Choi! Lee Doo-suk wishes to
formally offer his apology,

20:42.367 --> 20:43.159
Out! Everyone out!

20:43.243 --> 20:45.828
This is a police station,
not a street market!

20:48.039 --> 20:50.041
400,000 copies sold in 3 days,

20:50.124 --> 20:54.379
as the former officer in charge,
what's your opinion on the matter?

20:54.462 --> 20:56.339
Could we do this after lunch?

20:56.339 --> 21:01.469
Is he referring to you when he said
'someone will feel the guilt'?

21:01.469 --> 21:02.553
Get out!

21:04.764 --> 21:05.974
Get out now!

21:08.017 --> 21:09.852
God damn it!

21:11.187 --> 21:12.814
Let me eat in peace!

21:14.857 --> 21:17.902
- Please tell us!
- Everyone out!

21:17.986 --> 21:19.821
It's Lee Doo-suk!

21:21.948 --> 21:24.701
Please step out of the way

21:26.703 --> 21:27.870
Mr. Lee!

21:33.501 --> 21:34.752
What are you up to?

21:35.503 --> 21:37.380
It's been a while, Lieutenant

21:37.380 --> 21:39.048
Get that hand out of my face

21:45.221 --> 21:46.973
Is this your entourage?

21:48.433 --> 21:51.978
Not so happy to see me
after all these years?

21:55.481 --> 21:58.192
Come on, smile for the camera

21:58.192 --> 22:01.904
- Shut your fucking trap!
- Same old foul mouth.

22:05.325 --> 22:08.202
Holy shit!
Is he nuts?!

22:30.433 --> 22:31.601
Move aside!

22:32.852 --> 22:34.645
Yo Lee, have you eaten yet?

22:36.898 --> 22:37.774
What?

22:37.774 --> 22:40.360
Eat this shit, motherfucker!

22:40.485 --> 22:42.904
Have some more!

22:46.199 --> 22:48.284
Hey! give me the gun!

23:06.469 --> 23:07.595
Mr. Kang Do-hyuk

23:08.763 --> 23:10.139
Who are you?

23:10.139 --> 23:11.474
Welcome back

23:32.495 --> 23:36.416
'Amateur HQ' sign would complete the look

23:38.876 --> 23:40.169
I'll be with you!

23:40.711 --> 23:42.338
My bladder's about to burst,

23:42.338 --> 23:44.006
should I piss in my pants?

24:06.028 --> 24:07.113
Shit!

24:30.219 --> 24:33.556
You, you're Kang-sook?

24:33.723 --> 24:35.725
Get your pants up

24:36.559 --> 24:39.312
That brat, not a shred of shame!

24:39.937 --> 24:43.065
This is all there is to victims' families?

24:43.065 --> 24:45.193
After inquiring around,

24:45.193 --> 24:48.946
only a few of us will get involved
in this matter

24:48.946 --> 24:50.490
Forget it

24:50.490 --> 24:53.326
But madame, do we have to
get involved ourselves?

24:53.409 --> 24:55.411
Aren't there some shady men
you can hire?

24:57.455 --> 24:59.707
Look! A white snake!

25:02.251 --> 25:03.503
Do-hyuk's here!

25:04.086 --> 25:05.922
You've grown old

25:06.506 --> 25:07.673
Want a bowl of snake soup?

25:09.050 --> 25:11.344
Drop this nonsense and sit down!

25:12.512 --> 25:16.599
Couldn't assemble
a worst group even if I tried

25:17.308 --> 25:22.271
<i>'Confession of Murder's
breaking bestseller records,</i>

25:22.355 --> 25:25.107
He's so radiant

25:25.107 --> 25:29.070
You gotta be beautiful
even to commit crimes nowadays

25:29.070 --> 25:31.697
It's his willingness to repent
that makes him attractive

25:31.697 --> 25:34.158
Why don't you join his fan club then?

25:34.158 --> 25:38.454
Fan club? I'm too old for that...
but I should try.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.920
Are we celebrating his stint on our show?

25:45.920 --> 25:49.549
Station chief, we were able to get Lee...

25:49.549 --> 25:52.468
So did you get the Lieutenant or not?!

25:52.468 --> 25:57.515
Sir, I think we need to
rethink about Choi

25:57.515 --> 25:59.600
The last outburst is reason enough...

25:59.600 --> 26:02.812
If we put them in the same room
during a live show,

26:02.812 --> 26:04.564
we can't predict what he'll do

26:04.564 --> 26:07.483
Get them, whatever it takes!
Or clear out your desks!

26:07.483 --> 26:09.193
Chief, it's not that...

26:09.193 --> 26:13.155
He could shoot him dead on the air!

26:13.864 --> 26:16.325
Producer Park,

26:17.660 --> 26:23.457
if he kills on live television,

26:25.001 --> 26:28.546
it'll be an exclusive, a major one!

26:29.964 --> 26:31.299
Get Choi!

26:32.383 --> 26:35.261
What did he whisper
before you stuffed his face?

26:35.261 --> 26:37.471
He asked me to do it

26:37.471 --> 26:41.100
Look how well he manipulates the media

26:41.183 --> 26:42.685
He comes off as a saint

26:42.685 --> 26:45.479
I'm using the media too!

26:45.479 --> 26:48.232
Sure, you're giving them
plenty to write about

26:48.691 --> 26:49.775
idiot...

26:49.775 --> 26:52.695
By the way, my spidey senses are tingling

26:52.695 --> 26:56.073
I think he has an ulterior motive

26:56.073 --> 27:00.286
Repent, clean up his image
and start a business

27:00.286 --> 27:02.413
Like those celebrities

27:02.413 --> 27:04.165
Stop your yapping

27:04.790 --> 27:05.791
You got a call

27:11.088 --> 27:12.173
Hello?

27:13.424 --> 27:14.383
Yes, this is he

27:15.051 --> 27:16.218
What debate?

27:16.719 --> 27:19.180
How do you control the media so well?

27:19.680 --> 27:23.976
It was so clever to repent to the doctor

27:27.021 --> 27:29.899
One clean slap!

27:31.317 --> 27:34.236
If you went to those other hicks,

27:34.236 --> 27:39.200
they'd have tried anything to
get a piece of the pie!

27:39.909 --> 27:42.870
And what a brilliant idea to seek Choi!

27:43.579 --> 27:45.331
You planned this all, didn't you?

27:46.290 --> 27:48.959
So smart

27:49.418 --> 27:53.422
You already know
what'll happen at the debate, right?

27:57.843 --> 28:01.764
No, thank you
It's too early to celebrate

28:01.764 --> 28:04.058
You don't smoke, nor drink

28:04.058 --> 28:06.894
You take care of yourself too much

28:15.444 --> 28:16.987
Is this funny?

28:20.825 --> 28:24.954
That a killer is taking care of himself?

28:28.082 --> 28:29.625
Is it?

28:29.625 --> 28:34.004
No, it looks good...

28:34.588 --> 28:40.136
You're a celebrity now,
you must maintain your image

28:41.345 --> 28:44.473
Should I reserve a skin clinic?

28:44.473 --> 28:45.933
<i>Fuck that shit</i>

28:46.142 --> 28:47.184
Kidnap?

28:48.936 --> 28:53.649
I'll do it myself, just sit back
and have some ice cream

28:54.150 --> 28:55.151
Load of shit

28:55.735 --> 29:00.656
If you kill him before I find out
where my daughter is buried

29:02.575 --> 29:04.243
I will kill you myself

29:10.666 --> 29:11.667
Kill me?

29:12.626 --> 29:13.878
You will?

29:14.795 --> 29:16.714
Are we your pawns?

29:17.840 --> 29:20.426
Why should I risk my life
for your daughter?

29:20.509 --> 29:21.594
Hey!

29:22.386 --> 29:25.431
Go, do your own thing

29:26.682 --> 29:28.559
What did I tell you

29:28.559 --> 29:31.395
we don't need village idiots
who get locked up

29:32.354 --> 29:34.190
What did you say?!

29:34.482 --> 29:36.150
Do you know why I was locked up?

29:37.026 --> 29:38.903
I was out looking for this Lee fucker

29:39.195 --> 29:41.906
and I stabbed the wrong bastard
in the stomach!

29:42.907 --> 29:46.202
Whenever I saw someone similar

29:46.202 --> 29:49.121
I went after him with a knife in my hand!

29:51.582 --> 29:53.584
Do you know what I wish for the most?

29:54.043 --> 29:58.714
I pray to God to let me kill him
with my own hands!

30:00.382 --> 30:04.386
And now that he's out,
you get together for a tea party?!

30:05.596 --> 30:07.890
You make me sick!

30:08.891 --> 30:13.687
Sick? Does it look like
we're having a ball?

30:13.896 --> 30:15.147
Does it?

30:16.065 --> 30:18.067
You're not the only one in pain

30:25.491 --> 30:27.284
Every night in my dreams

30:30.079 --> 30:32.331
the scream of my dying child

30:33.874 --> 30:36.085
echoes in my head

30:38.087 --> 30:40.422
He doesn't deserve an easy death

30:42.550 --> 30:50.891
I want to cut off his limbs
and watch him tremble in pain

30:51.725 --> 30:54.103
and beg for his life

30:56.814 --> 31:00.276
That reason alone kept me alive

31:04.196 --> 31:06.574
I know how you feel, sir

31:09.451 --> 31:12.538
And I know you're suffering too

31:13.247 --> 31:16.584
But won't you let me remove that scar?

31:18.210 --> 31:21.463
This is like a trophy for a detective

31:22.298 --> 31:24.592
And how dare I remove
the scar he gave me?

31:24.592 --> 31:29.305
I know what you're going through,
but don't torture yourself

31:30.931 --> 31:35.352
'Confession of Murder' Book Signing

32:08.928 --> 32:09.803
What's your name?

32:09.803 --> 32:12.348
It's me
Don't you recognize me?

32:18.854 --> 32:20.105
Your name is...

32:20.105 --> 32:21.857
Choi Hyung-go, motherfucker!

32:24.234 --> 32:27.947
Look how popular you are, shitface

32:27.947 --> 32:30.991
Look at this line-up
Breaking the bank?

32:30.991 --> 32:33.285
Let go of me, you fucks!

32:33.285 --> 32:34.995
Why are you here, Lieutenant?

32:34.995 --> 32:36.997
I'm here on a government duty

32:36.997 --> 32:39.041
Check out this tough guy

32:39.041 --> 32:41.627
I should get your autograph instead

32:41.877 --> 32:43.587
How does it feel to work for him?

32:43.587 --> 32:45.798
Licking his asshole for a buck, huh?

32:46.632 --> 32:49.259
Sell a ton, motherfucker!

32:49.593 --> 32:56.308
His security detail and cops are
always at official events

32:56.308 --> 32:57.434
What else does he do?

32:57.434 --> 33:01.855
He rents out the entire swimming pool
at Ecograd Hotel for 30 minutes

33:03.649 --> 33:05.401
The entire pool?

33:05.401 --> 33:08.696
Being in public would
compromise his safety

33:09.488 --> 33:14.368
He's got money to burn,
and it's good publicity for the hotel

33:14.368 --> 33:17.413
He killed our ladies for
a dip in their blood, huh?

33:17.413 --> 33:20.916
But wouldn't he have
his bodyguards at the pool?

33:21.959 --> 33:26.672
Sure, but they won't swim alongside

33:26.672 --> 33:29.216
So, what do you want to do?

33:36.473 --> 33:40.269
The plan starts with you

35:00.557 --> 35:02.684
Sir!
What is it?

35:07.981 --> 35:10.150
Sir! Sir!

35:14.488 --> 35:16.240
Sir!

35:17.491 --> 35:19.952
Are you alright?

35:19.952 --> 35:21.120
Call 119 Now!

35:21.120 --> 35:23.539
Snap out of it!

35:33.215 --> 35:34.508
How long since the bite?

35:34.508 --> 35:35.759
About 5 minutes

35:36.301 --> 35:37.469
Will he be okay?

35:37.469 --> 35:40.347
Yes, he'll be okay with this antidote

35:45.686 --> 35:47.146
Help us lift him

35:56.155 --> 35:57.698
Which district are you from?

36:02.619 --> 36:03.745
Yongsan district

36:04.288 --> 36:05.747
We're from Yongsan

36:09.042 --> 36:11.962
I think there was
a miscommunication

36:11.962 --> 36:16.341
Clearly there was a mistake,
and say hello to my knife!

36:16.425 --> 36:19.136
One of you will die by this knife!
Get back!

36:19.219 --> 36:21.096
I'll hold them back, get going!

36:21.096 --> 36:22.431
Daddy, just go!

36:23.932 --> 36:27.394
We can't leave him!
He can take care of his own ass!

36:30.939 --> 36:32.524
Get back!

36:33.942 --> 36:34.943
Get them!

36:35.777 --> 36:36.820
Eat this!

36:39.448 --> 36:40.157
Stop!

36:44.119 --> 36:48.040
Give me your hand!

36:48.999 --> 36:50.000
Come on!

36:54.129 --> 36:55.547
Hit the brake!

37:01.470 --> 37:02.638
Sir, get in!

37:05.140 --> 37:08.936
Why the hell
did they kidnap him in my turf?

37:09.519 --> 37:10.812
Have you traced his location?

37:10.812 --> 37:12.648
<i>His security detail's on them</i>

37:12.648 --> 37:15.317
<i>They're southbound from Sinlim</i>

37:15.317 --> 37:16.652
Sir, where are you now?

37:16.652 --> 37:18.403
I'm right on them!

37:43.679 --> 37:45.180
It's not mom...

37:45.180 --> 37:47.474
Pumpkin, it's alright

37:47.683 --> 37:49.559
Tell me she's okay

37:49.685 --> 37:51.853
Mom's fine

38:04.491 --> 38:06.159
- Lt. Choi's on your tail!
- Choi?

38:26.430 --> 38:27.889
What just happened?!

38:27.889 --> 38:31.184
Don't you see, he's onto us!
Step on it, old man!

38:31.184 --> 38:32.644
Ok

38:34.896 --> 38:36.857
Step on it!!

38:36.857 --> 38:39.067
I'm stepping on it!

38:39.067 --> 38:40.819
Why doesn't it go any faster?!

38:40.819 --> 38:41.862
Shut up!

38:41.987 --> 38:43.739
Do something!

38:43.739 --> 38:45.240
Will you shut up?!

38:53.081 --> 38:54.541
He's gonna get us this way!

38:54.541 --> 38:56.084
Oh, jeez

38:57.044 --> 38:58.128
We can't get caught

39:03.258 --> 39:04.259
Shit!

39:04.593 --> 39:05.552
Stop the car!

39:05.761 --> 39:06.595
Huh?

39:16.104 --> 39:17.230
Shit, what do we do?

39:17.773 --> 39:19.566
What are you doing!

39:19.566 --> 39:20.901
I'll kill you!

39:35.916 --> 39:37.000
Crazy fuckers!

39:43.173 --> 39:44.007
Give me your hand!

39:44.841 --> 39:46.259
I don't believe this

39:47.302 --> 39:48.512
Grab my hand!

40:03.985 --> 40:06.154
Smash him!

40:27.008 --> 40:30.262
Shit, get close!

40:46.736 --> 40:48.530
Fucker!

40:51.700 --> 40:53.076
Watch out!

40:57.205 --> 40:59.291
Are you fucking nuts!

41:03.712 --> 41:05.172
Stop the car!

41:15.223 --> 41:16.516
Stop!

41:30.614 --> 41:31.573
Hey fucker

41:31.948 --> 41:33.074
Dying!

41:43.376 --> 41:44.544
Pull!

41:52.385 --> 41:53.303
Slow down!

41:53.303 --> 41:54.471
Daddy, stop!

41:59.559 --> 42:00.769
Pumpkin, are you alright?!

42:01.144 --> 42:03.021
Get off of me!

42:08.777 --> 42:09.694
What are you up to?!

42:09.694 --> 42:11.196
Just watch!

42:19.204 --> 42:21.289
Eat this, you fucks!

42:36.596 --> 42:37.681
Goddammit!

42:44.854 --> 42:46.147
I'm serious

42:46.815 --> 42:49.943
It happened so fast,
we couldn't do anything

42:50.443 --> 42:52.654
Answer me straight, baldie!

42:53.572 --> 42:56.074
How could there be snakes
in a hotel pool?!

42:56.408 --> 43:00.495
I'm serious sir!
He was bitten and we called 911

43:00.495 --> 43:03.081
And they showed up as if
they were on standby?

43:03.081 --> 43:04.749
That's right

43:05.250 --> 43:06.334
Fuck...

43:06.334 --> 43:08.169
They really planned this out

43:08.169 --> 43:09.045
Lt. Choi!

43:09.045 --> 43:10.922
You can't come in here!

43:14.551 --> 43:15.844
Let's get out of here!

43:15.844 --> 43:19.681
Lt. Choi, a word please!

43:20.515 --> 43:23.560
Have you identified the abductors?

43:24.144 --> 43:25.562
Lt. Choi, a word please!

43:25.687 --> 43:29.524
Kang-sook and her dad live
in the mountain, so no fixed address

43:29.649 --> 43:33.361
Do-hyuk was released 2 days ago
and won't be easy to track

43:34.946 --> 43:36.698
Should I look into their cells?

43:36.698 --> 43:39.534
They're not stupid enough
to use their own cells!

43:42.203 --> 43:45.373
Wait, can 911 call be intercepted?

43:45.373 --> 43:46.541
Oh!

43:47.292 --> 43:49.878
That's probably impossible

43:49.878 --> 43:51.212
I'm heading home for a bit

43:51.212 --> 43:53.506
look into how one might
rent an ambulance

43:53.506 --> 43:54.090
Sure

43:54.174 --> 43:55.467
<i>According to the rumors</i>

43:55.467 --> 43:58.803
<i>the abductors are
the victims' families, is this true ?</i>

43:58.803 --> 44:01.389
<i>Don't draw your own conclusion!</i>

44:01.389 --> 44:03.183
Do you think he saw us?

44:03.183 --> 44:05.393
He's not deaf, dumb and blind!

44:05.935 --> 44:07.729
We were all over his car

44:08.730 --> 44:10.732
<i>So it's not the victims' families?</i>

44:10.732 --> 44:12.984
<i>Are you all having fun?</i>

44:13.443 --> 44:14.277
<i>Are you?!</i>

44:14.694 --> 44:15.612
<i>Go away;</i>

44:15.612 --> 44:19.282
Could you use gentle words on TV?

44:19.282 --> 44:21.076
Will you turn that off?

44:21.076 --> 44:23.912
That temper of yours...

44:26.581 --> 44:27.916
Hyung-gu

44:28.667 --> 44:32.962
how about we get rid of the car wash
and start a coffee shop?

44:32.962 --> 44:34.923
Stop talking nonsense
and help me put this on

44:35.173 --> 44:41.096
I hear the women love
running coffee shops nowadays

44:41.096 --> 44:45.350
Start a coffee shop
with your retirement money

44:45.350 --> 44:50.063
find a wife and live happily ever after!

44:50.063 --> 44:54.359
You know I make tasty coffee, right?

44:54.359 --> 44:55.610
Oh, mom...

44:55.610 --> 44:59.364
Women don't drink old fashion coffee

44:59.364 --> 45:03.368
They only drink coffee those guys make

45:03.368 --> 45:05.995
ameripresso or something

45:05.995 --> 45:07.706
You don't know anything

45:08.998 --> 45:11.251
Why are you putting that on!

45:11.251 --> 45:13.086
You're supposed to put this on!

45:13.086 --> 45:14.546
You should have told me!

45:14.546 --> 45:17.090
Do I have to spell it out?
Just forget it!

45:18.174 --> 45:20.301
I'm out for a few days,
so don't call!

45:21.886 --> 45:25.140
Where did he get that temper?

45:25.348 --> 45:27.976
<i>In the light of Lee Doo -suk's abduction</i>

45:27.976 --> 45:32.021
<i>the bereaved families
have turned into suspects...</i>

45:34.149 --> 45:37.068
How about I talk to them instead?

45:37.068 --> 45:40.363
They planned this meticulously,
they won't back down so easily

45:43.908 --> 45:45.201
What did you find out?

45:45.201 --> 45:49.122
I got a hunch, so I looked into
special prop vehicles

45:49.122 --> 45:51.332
Here, Kim... Ong-go?

45:51.332 --> 45:52.125
Kim Yong-go

45:52.125 --> 45:55.587
Someone named Kim Yong-gu
outright bought it

45:55.587 --> 45:56.838
Do you feel the tingle?

45:56.838 --> 45:58.214
<i>Yeah?</i>

45:58.214 --> 45:59.507
<i>Dig further and report back</i>

45:59.507 --> 46:00.467
Yes, sir!

46:00.467 --> 46:03.386
I went through a lot of trouble
to borrow this

46:04.220 --> 46:06.514
Why do you need this anyway?

46:06.514 --> 46:08.516
Do I have to report that to you?

46:08.516 --> 46:09.893
To me you do!

46:09.893 --> 46:11.144
Dammit, you startled me!

46:12.020 --> 46:14.189
Are you going to Iraq?

46:14.189 --> 46:17.150
Since it's collecting dust,
I thought I'd clean my attic with it

46:17.150 --> 46:18.234
You'll do what?

46:18.234 --> 46:19.235
Give me your car key

46:20.195 --> 46:22.530
You take me for an asswipe?

46:22.530 --> 46:23.907
You're not an asswipe

46:23.907 --> 46:26.951
I'll bring Lee in myself!

46:28.620 --> 46:30.789
Kim Yong-go is a private dick

46:30.789 --> 46:33.958
His client is Jung Tae-suk,
Han Ji-soo's son

46:33.958 --> 46:34.959
Han Ji-soo?

46:35.877 --> 46:37.378
Woori Seafood's chairman?

46:37.378 --> 46:40.757
Yes, there's Jung's cell number too

46:40.757 --> 46:42.550
<i>Get Unit 3 to track their location</i>

46:42.550 --> 46:43.885
His location?

46:43.885 --> 46:46.596
But we need a warrant for that,

46:46.596 --> 46:48.556
it'll take some time

46:48.556 --> 46:50.391
<i>There is none, asshole!</i>

46:50.391 --> 46:52.477
Detective, I can do that instantly

46:52.477 --> 46:53.812
One moment sir.
What?

46:53.812 --> 46:55.522
Our specialty is infidelity,

46:55.522 --> 46:56.898
precise and immediate solution

46:56.898 --> 47:00.068
As soon as they enter the motel zone,

47:00.068 --> 47:03.696
we can track their location
within one minute!

47:03.696 --> 47:07.075
As soon as they cum,
we're all over them

47:08.076 --> 47:09.661
Happy with your work?

47:09.911 --> 47:11.079
YES

47:11.412 --> 47:12.872
Sir, we can track him from here

47:12.872 --> 47:14.290
Okay, then do it

47:25.468 --> 47:26.928
What am I supposed to look at?

47:26.928 --> 47:28.012
<i>Got him?</i>

47:28.012 --> 47:29.889
Yes sir, we got his location now

47:30.390 --> 47:31.432
Where is he?

47:32.267 --> 47:34.060
He's heading to Osan from Suwon

47:34.060 --> 47:36.062
Osan? How far away from me?

47:36.062 --> 47:37.272
7Km, sir.

47:41.484 --> 47:43.319
Osan IC

47:43.319 --> 47:44.696
Okay, he's on Osan IC!

47:47.031 --> 47:48.533
- Which highway?
- 23, sir!

47:48.533 --> 47:50.285
- How far away?
- 3km!

47:53.913 --> 47:56.040
- What about now?
- You're almost on him!

47:57.709 --> 47:58.877
I got him!

48:01.337 --> 48:02.839
Should I send support?

48:02.839 --> 48:04.799
- No, standby!
- Sir?

48:04.799 --> 48:07.427
Don't contact anyone
until I call you back

48:07.427 --> 48:08.887
What will you do?

48:32.952 --> 48:34.871
How you're going to use it?

48:42.003 --> 48:44.464
He's... he's waking up!

48:45.173 --> 48:46.883
You son of a bitch!

48:46.966 --> 48:48.676
<i>Wake up!</i>

48:48.676 --> 48:50.887
<i>Snap out!</i>

48:51.512 --> 48:54.223
<i>Wake up!</i>

48:56.726 --> 48:57.518
Lee Doo-suk

48:59.729 --> 49:02.065
Where's my child?
Jung Su-yun

49:02.065 --> 49:03.358
What did you do to her?

49:04.025 --> 49:04.859
Jung Su-yun...

49:04.859 --> 49:06.694
Yes, Jung Su-yun!

49:07.278 --> 49:08.488
Lieutenant...

49:08.488 --> 49:09.864
What did you do to her?!

49:11.199 --> 49:12.659
What did you do!

49:12.659 --> 49:14.702
What's this?

49:14.702 --> 49:15.620
Blackout?

49:15.620 --> 49:17.038
Does anyone have a cell phone?

49:17.038 --> 49:18.289
Here

49:19.582 --> 49:21.125
What the hell's going on?

49:21.668 --> 49:23.252
<i>Holy shit!</i>

49:23.252 --> 49:25.213
Don't do that, old man!

49:25.213 --> 49:28.049
Don't just stand there,
get the switch!

49:28.049 --> 49:29.050
Fuck off

49:30.134 --> 49:31.386
I think something just moved

49:31.386 --> 49:32.720
What moved?

49:36.808 --> 49:38.434
Are you ok?

49:38.434 --> 49:40.395
What the fuck was that?!

49:40.395 --> 49:41.688
Turn on the light!

49:41.688 --> 49:44.399
I can see you,
don't do anything stupid!

49:44.399 --> 49:46.818
- Be quiet
- What have you got?

49:46.818 --> 49:50.196
- I'm not lying
- What is it?

49:50.279 --> 49:51.906
Stay calm!

49:51.906 --> 49:54.867
Lee Doo-suk!
Where's my daughter?!

49:54.867 --> 49:57.453
Tell me where she is!

49:57.453 --> 49:59.998
Tell me! Where is she?!
Please tell me!

49:59.998 --> 50:02.667
Please tell me!

50:02.667 --> 50:04.460
Are you alright?

50:05.670 --> 50:08.798
- Who are you?
- What's wrong? What do you see?

50:08.798 --> 50:10.925
Who's there?!

50:11.801 --> 50:13.594
Who are you?!

50:13.594 --> 50:15.430
Shut up!

50:15.430 --> 50:18.016
Lee Doo-suk's gone!

50:18.016 --> 50:21.477
Where did he go? Find him!

50:21.477 --> 50:23.730
- I got him! I got him!
- Let go, that's my leg!

50:23.730 --> 50:26.274
- Daddy, over there!
- Where?

50:26.774 --> 50:31.654
Goddammit!
Stop right there!

51:15.490 --> 51:16.616
No!

51:29.420 --> 51:31.005
That crazy bitch!

51:44.894 --> 51:46.395
Dammit...

51:46.395 --> 51:50.358
I told you we should've killed him!

52:33.818 --> 52:37.321
The abductors were my overzealous fans

52:37.530 --> 52:40.616
They simply acted out
their innocent fantasy

52:40.700 --> 52:44.203
and I came back in one piece

52:44.203 --> 52:48.082
So you won't press any charges
against your abductors?

52:48.082 --> 52:49.417
That's correct

52:50.042 --> 52:54.046
I'm the one at fault,
how could I blame them?

52:54.046 --> 52:57.717
Will you still attend next week's
televised debate?

52:57.717 --> 52:58.926
Of course

52:59.260 --> 53:01.596
It's not just a promise with the network

53:01.596 --> 53:04.223
<i>- I believe that this program...
- Lieutenant!</i>

53:04.223 --> 53:06.809
What the hell happened to my car!

53:06.809 --> 53:09.312
Did you drive through a shootout?

53:09.312 --> 53:11.439
You got insurance

53:11.898 --> 53:13.274
That fuck

53:13.274 --> 53:16.777
he's got media on his fingertip

53:16.777 --> 53:19.155
<i>...represents my way of
apologizing to the public</i>

53:19.780 --> 53:22.533
Will you really go on TV?

53:22.533 --> 53:23.618
I don't know!

53:25.494 --> 53:28.497
It's nice to cover
for the victims' families

53:28.581 --> 53:30.291
but we got arrest rate
to consider too

53:30.291 --> 53:32.251
Shut the fuck up!

53:32.251 --> 53:33.294
Where is Hyung-gu!

53:33.294 --> 53:35.838
Choi Hyung-gu! What is that?!

53:35.838 --> 53:37.215
Did you let that happen?

53:37.215 --> 53:39.258
He said he walked out of there

53:39.258 --> 53:41.636
You said you were gonna bring him!

53:41.636 --> 53:44.639
But he walked out on his own,
what was I supposed to do?

53:44.639 --> 53:46.349
Goddammit!

54:40.194 --> 54:41.821
Pumpkin

54:41.988 --> 54:43.322
Where are you going?

54:43.322 --> 54:46.367
Gonna go fishing, I feel stuffy

54:46.450 --> 54:50.371
It's chilly now,
don't stay out too long

54:50.371 --> 54:51.330
Yeah

54:54.583 --> 54:56.711
Daddy...

54:56.711 --> 54:57.878
Yeah?

55:00.756 --> 55:02.717
Don't worry, go to sleep

55:02.883 --> 55:04.885
Alright, pumpkin!

55:18.524 --> 55:20.401
Lieutenant, please sit over here

55:23.571 --> 55:25.656
Yo imposter,
you're a celebrity now?

55:26.449 --> 55:29.827
You're a bit late, Lieutenant

55:30.202 --> 55:33.331
I'm sorry you wrecked your car
because of me

55:33.706 --> 55:37.835
Thank you for
always looking out for me

55:37.835 --> 55:40.880
You think I got some time to kill?

55:45.426 --> 55:47.511
AD, here's the last commercial

55:47.636 --> 55:49.180
Last commercial!

55:49.180 --> 55:51.682
Please don't doze off,
just stay awake for 100 minutes!

55:56.312 --> 55:57.313
Cue!

55:58.189 --> 56:00.983
<i>Over 3 million copies sold in one month,</i>

56:00.983 --> 56:03.611
<i>estimated profit of $20 million,</i>

56:03.611 --> 56:06.864
<i>serial killer-turned-bestselling author,
Lee Doo-suk</i>

56:06.864 --> 56:13.329
<i>Why is he repenting after causing
so much pain?</i>

56:14.497 --> 56:15.956
<i>Welcome to Public Debate</i>

56:15.956 --> 56:18.459
I am your host Son Jong-hak

56:18.793 --> 56:23.506
<i>The success of 'Confession of Murder'
is quite startling</i>

56:23.506 --> 56:27.968
<i>Shall we start the debate
with the main factor for its popularity?</i>

56:27.968 --> 56:29.220
Yes, professor Jung

56:29.220 --> 56:31.430
That's a simple question to answer,

56:31.430 --> 56:33.557
it's because the author is a serial killer

56:33.557 --> 56:37.686
Using expiration of statute of limitations
as a reason to confess with a book

56:37.686 --> 56:40.356
it's the best marketing strategy, isn't it?

56:40.356 --> 56:42.483
Perhaps he only killed those women,

56:42.483 --> 56:46.737
only to write and market this book

56:46.737 --> 56:49.865
Sir, your creative liberty is off the charts

56:49.865 --> 56:51.992
Sure it is

56:51.992 --> 56:55.788
But this clearly shows an ulterior motive

56:55.788 --> 56:59.834
With the publishing of the book,
the author is raking in

56:59.834 --> 57:02.169
a massive amount of wealth
through his crime

57:02.169 --> 57:04.797
Wait, what evidence do you have
to back up this view?

57:04.797 --> 57:07.800
One moment please,
let's clear the air

57:07.800 --> 57:11.804
As expected, the debate is
already heating up

57:11.804 --> 57:17.518
Ms. Jang, haven't you evaluated him
before his book was published?

57:17.518 --> 57:23.399
At the time, Mr. Lee confessed that
his heinous crime would deter others,

57:23.482 --> 57:28.279
and play a small role
in preventing further atrocity

57:28.988 --> 57:35.494
Just thinking about our session
makes me misty

57:37.538 --> 57:42.209
He talked about that
and cried tears of remorse

57:42.209 --> 57:45.212
Please compose yourself

57:45.212 --> 57:46.547
I'm so sorry

57:46.547 --> 57:51.427
During our pre-interview,
Lt. Choi defiantly stated that

57:51.552 --> 57:54.805
Lee Doo-suk is not the real killer

57:54.805 --> 57:56.849
Do you have any concrete proof?

57:57.975 --> 58:00.644
To his fans' disappointment,
he'll be arrested soon

58:00.644 --> 58:02.229
For fraud

58:04.023 --> 58:08.110
Between 1986 and 1990,
10 women were murdered

58:08.235 --> 58:11.739
Another went missing in that period

58:11.739 --> 58:14.408
but her remains are yet to be found

58:14.408 --> 58:17.203
I am certain that this is also
the work of the serial killer,

58:17.203 --> 58:20.080
<i>and this was his final kill</i>

58:20.831 --> 58:22.416
<i>Answer to his accusation is simple</i>

58:22.750 --> 58:25.961
<i>I did not commit that last crime</i>

58:25.961 --> 58:30.341
Or you just don't have access
to the information regarding it

58:30.341 --> 58:34.261
Then do you remember
what you said to me

58:34.261 --> 58:36.055
when we met that night?

58:36.430 --> 58:38.849
Well, what did I say?

58:39.767 --> 58:43.604
Unlike you,
it wasn't a pleasant night for me

58:43.604 --> 58:45.523
Don't people rely on

58:45.523 --> 58:50.528
the power of forgetfulness
more than memory?

58:50.694 --> 58:52.279
Forgetfulness?

58:53.614 --> 58:56.033
You certainly talk the talk
like a con artist

58:56.158 --> 58:58.494
Did you just say... con artist?

58:58.494 --> 59:00.621
Did I hear that right?

59:01.455 --> 59:05.376
As a human rights lawyer,
I find that offensive

59:05.376 --> 59:07.670
Woman, was I talking to you?

59:07.753 --> 59:08.796
Lt. Choi

59:09.380 --> 59:10.631
One moment please

59:12.716 --> 59:13.968
I must apologize

59:14.093 --> 59:17.638
Let's change the pace
and get to the calls

59:17.721 --> 59:20.391
You're on the air,
what is your name and city?

59:20.391 --> 59:24.687
<i>I'm Lee Bong-ryun,
and I own a bookstore in Busan</i>

59:24.687 --> 59:27.314
What is your opinion?

59:27.314 --> 59:31.151
<i>The book is selling like hotcakes,</i>

59:31.151 --> 59:35.948
<i>so I Wanted to personally thank Mr. Lee...</i>

59:36.574 --> 59:41.412
<i>You 're such a hottle,
thanks for everything</i>

59:41.412 --> 59:46.166
<i>Speaking of which,
how about a book from Mr. Choi too?</i>

59:46.166 --> 59:50.921
Thank you for your comment
concerning the need for diverse books

59:50.921 --> 59:53.841
in order to revitalize
the publishing industry

59:53.841 --> 59:56.343
Let's get to the next caller

59:56.760 --> 59:59.221
You're on the air,
what is your name and city?

59:59.221 --> 01:00:04.560
<i>As a civil figure,
could I stay anonymous?</i>

01:00:04.643 --> 01:00:06.186
<i>Please call me 'J'</i>

01:00:06.395 --> 01:00:10.274
Yes, of course
What is your opinion?

01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:15.279
<i>As a fan of Mr. Lee,
I wanted to ask a few things</i>

01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:20.951
<i>Do you know how fast
Lt. Choi runs the 100m?</i>

01:00:21.869 --> 01:00:23.203
Well...

01:00:24.246 --> 01:00:29.418
<i>I'm told that in his prime,
he did it in 12 seconds</i>

01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:34.173
<i>You used alleys and roofs
during your chase,</i>

01:00:34.173 --> 01:00:37.926
<i>you must've avoided
straightaways for this reason</i>

01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:42.765
Now that I think about it, I think so

01:00:42.765 --> 01:00:47.478
<i>Also, I read that you performed
a judo flip to pin him down</i>

01:00:47.478 --> 01:00:50.105
<i>Do you know judo
or other martial arts?</i>

01:00:51.023 --> 01:00:53.484
Do I have to be a judo player
to use that technique?

01:00:53.484 --> 01:00:58.947
<i>No, but I majored judo
at College of Physical Education</i>

01:00:58.947 --> 01:01:04.119
<i>But Mn not a muscle head
I play an instrument too</i>

01:01:04.119 --> 01:01:06.789
<i>And cook quite well</i>

01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:10.834
I'm sorry, could you state
your opinion please?

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:12.378
<i>Ah, right</i>

01:01:12.378 --> 01:01:18.008
<i>Do you know that the Lieutenant
is terrible with time?</i>

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:19.635
He was late today too

01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:22.388
He should really get a good watch

01:01:24.139 --> 01:01:25.641
By the way...

01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:31.021
I see it now,
you're his fan, not mine

01:01:32.398 --> 01:01:34.942
<i>- Mr. Lee.</i>
- Yes?

01:01:34.942 --> 01:01:38.445
<i>You really don't get it, do you?</i>

01:01:38.445 --> 01:01:40.155
No, I really don't know

01:01:41.407 --> 01:01:43.409
<i>This is why I was never caught</i>

01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:46.954
Huh?

01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:50.666
J, what do you mean?

01:01:50.791 --> 01:01:53.252
<i>Lee Doo-suk, don't put on a show</i>

01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:56.296
What a load of shit...

01:01:57.631 --> 01:02:00.092
You don't honestly believe that, do you?

01:02:01.093 --> 01:02:02.344
Lt. Choi!

01:02:02.344 --> 01:02:03.387
Gwang-su!

01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:05.889
Lt. Choi!

01:02:07.307 --> 01:02:09.143
Have you tracked him?

01:02:09.143 --> 01:02:11.895
I'm working on it
Get me the location now!

01:02:13.147 --> 01:02:17.776
Dangsan-dong,
#260

01:02:17.985 --> 01:02:19.319
What?!

01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:24.992
- She's not answering?
- Shit!

01:02:24.992 --> 01:02:28.871
Sir! How could you tell us that now?!

01:02:28.871 --> 01:02:33.292
How was I supposed to know?
I thought she needed some fresh air

01:02:33.292 --> 01:02:35.753
You fed her too much snake!

01:02:35.753 --> 01:02:37.838
She's out for blood!

01:02:37.838 --> 01:02:41.633
If Lee is not the killer,
we're really fucked

01:02:42.843 --> 01:02:45.345
The public is in a state of turmoil
A comment please!

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:46.972
Mr. Lee, how do you respond?

01:02:54.188 --> 01:02:56.899
- Who could be doing this?
- Is the caller the real killer?

01:03:10.204 --> 01:03:14.708
Please don't get swayed by
a prank caller desperate for attention

01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:21.256
Everyone has the right to speak his mind,
but it should not be a lie

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:44.905
What the hell happened?!

01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:52.663
What's going on?!
Someone do something!

01:03:54.915 --> 01:03:56.500
Over there!

01:03:56.959 --> 01:03:58.794
Take the picture!

01:04:49.678 --> 01:04:55.267
<i>I told you I'd slit
your mother's throat if you piss me off</i>

01:05:02.608 --> 01:05:03.817
Where's your mother?

01:05:05.944 --> 01:05:08.238
Where is he...

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:11.158
Where is this fuck!

01:05:11.158 --> 01:05:15.454
Come out, motherfucker!

01:05:15.454 --> 01:05:21.043
- Come out, you fuck!
- Lieutenant!

01:05:21.043 --> 01:05:23.086
- Come out here!
- Lieutenant!

01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:25.255
Come out here!

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:28.008
- Come out, you fuck!
- Lieutenant!

01:05:30.886 --> 01:05:33.347
What are you doing?!

01:05:33.347 --> 01:05:38.143
You're waking up the entire city
in the middle of the night!!

01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:40.812
- Mom...
- Are you all drunk?

01:05:40.812 --> 01:05:42.439
Are you okay?

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:48.195
Why are you sleeping in my room?

01:05:48.195 --> 01:05:51.698
I told you my heater's broken!

01:05:54.034 --> 01:05:57.537
What's with you,
you're not being yourself!

01:05:57.537 --> 01:05:59.039
Stay put for a bit

01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:05.545
What's got into you all of sudden?

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:11.885
Gwang-su...

01:06:11.885 --> 01:06:13.053
Yes sir?

01:06:13.679 --> 01:06:15.472
Stay with my mom for a moment

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:16.264
Sir?

01:06:16.765 --> 01:06:18.767
- Where are you going?
- Hyung-go!

01:06:23.855 --> 01:06:25.065
Watch the road!

01:07:16.158 --> 01:07:17.409
I'll take it out

01:07:17.409 --> 01:07:18.952
Goddammit!

01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:21.288
<i>Why did you dress me up for?</i>

01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:24.249
<i>You're gonna kill me anyway</i>

01:07:24.249 --> 01:07:28.670
<i>Please, let me hear his voice
one last time...</i>

01:07:31.131 --> 01:07:35.677
<i>Violent Crimes
Hello? Hello?</i>

01:07:37.637 --> 01:07:40.766
<i>Why did you hit the victim then!</i>

01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:43.643
<i>Detective, I'm the victim here!</i>

01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:46.521
<i>Hello? What do you Want?</i>

01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:57.491
<i>Please don 2' kill me...</i>

01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:03.330
<i>I. . . want to live. .</i>

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:08.001
<i>Violent Crimes
Hello? Hello?</i>

01:08:09.503 --> 01:08:12.923
<i>Why did you hit the victim then!</i>

01:08:13.507 --> 01:08:16.051
<i>Detective, I'm the victim here!</i>

01:08:16.176 --> 01:08:18.511
<i>Hello? What do you Want?</i>

01:08:20.138 --> 01:08:22.682
<i>Why did you hit the victim...</i>

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:25.935
<i>Detective, I'm the victim here!</i>

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:27.938
<i>Hello? What do you...</i>

01:08:34.069 --> 01:08:37.863
<i>Detective, I'm the victim here!</i>

01:08:56.883 --> 01:08:58.801
I want to live...

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:14.693
<i>Violent Crimes
Hello? Hello?</i>

01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:18.904
<i>Why did you hit the victim then!</i>

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.160
<i>Detective, I'm the victim here!</i>

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.245
<i>Hello? What do you Want?</i>

01:09:27.581 --> 01:09:28.915
Gwang-su

01:09:28.915 --> 01:09:29.707
Yes?

01:09:30.375 --> 01:09:31.751
Call a press conference

01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:33.545
Find anything?

01:09:33.962 --> 01:09:36.006
Tell them I got a major scoop

01:09:36.006 --> 01:09:37.131
What's that?

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:40.468
Let's put on a show too

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:45.932
This is a knife that was sent in by J,
who claims to be the real killer

01:09:46.474 --> 01:09:52.272
After analyzing the blood on it,
NIS confirmed that it matches my own

01:09:53.148 --> 01:09:57.694
Then are you confirming that
J is the real serial killer?

01:09:57.694 --> 01:10:00.155
So Lee Doo-suk is an impostor?

01:10:00.155 --> 01:10:01.615
We cannot draw a conclusion right now

01:10:02.324 --> 01:10:07.078
The slug in his shoulder matches
the type that I used at the time,

01:10:07.078 --> 01:10:10.498
and while his lack of knowledge
on the final case is questionable,

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:14.461
the details he wrote
in the book are so accurate

01:10:14.461 --> 01:10:17.172
that only the killer could've written it

01:10:17.172 --> 01:10:19.507
<i>so who's the real killer then ?</i>

01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:21.218
<i>That is all for now</i>

01:10:22.427 --> 01:10:23.803
What the hell...

01:10:23.803 --> 01:10:27.307
So, they don't know who the real killer is

01:10:27.307 --> 01:10:32.979
Considering that J sent in the actual knife,
could he be the real thing?

01:10:32.979 --> 01:10:36.691
Of course not
Don't forget that Lee wrote the book

01:10:36.691 --> 01:10:40.028
He couldn't have wrote it
without being there

01:10:40.028 --> 01:10:42.239
Alright!

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:45.492
Let's get to the next round!

01:10:45.492 --> 01:10:49.496
We get all three of them
in the debate

01:10:49.496 --> 01:10:51.831
We can get Choi and Lee to the table,

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.459
but there's no way to get J

01:10:54.459 --> 01:10:59.881
You're getting paid to find a way

01:11:00.507 --> 01:11:03.510
Producer Park, get the exclusive

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:06.012
But we don't even know J's number...

01:11:06.012 --> 01:11:09.849
Then put out an ad

01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:14.396
You're not even trying to do your job!

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:18.024
- Is the knife the most decisive evidence?
- Hello?

01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:20.110
Does this mean J is the real killer?

01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:22.696
<i>Treat those reporters
with some respect</i>

01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:24.030
Who the hell is this?

01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:27.075
<i>Don't you recognize my voice?</i>

01:11:27.075 --> 01:11:30.620
<i>Buddy! Can't you see the red light?!</i>

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.622
<i>I'm sorry</i>

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:34.374
Who the fuck is this?

01:11:35.125 --> 01:11:39.671
<i>Your mom was working alone today,
why don't you help for once!</i>

01:11:39.879 --> 01:11:41.715
You son of a!

01:11:45.176 --> 01:11:45.969
Keep them out!

01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:52.976
Yes, Lieutenant

01:11:53.393 --> 01:11:55.103
Who did you just talk to?

01:11:55.437 --> 01:11:56.563
There are many people here

01:11:56.563 --> 01:11:58.023
<i>You call yourself a cop?!</i>

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:03.570
What crawled up his ass?

01:12:04.279 --> 01:12:08.325
These were taken by my bodyguard
during my abduction,

01:12:08.325 --> 01:12:12.412
the knife is missing,
while cash is intact

01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:14.706
<i>It looks like an elaborate ploy</i>

01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:19.794
<i>to take credit as the serial killer
by stealing my evidence</i>

01:12:20.879 --> 01:12:24.466
<i>I don't know who this J is
but he sure is an amateur</i>

01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:28.386
<i>I will provide further detail at
press conference tomorrow</i>

01:12:43.943 --> 01:12:47.614
<i>How long are you gonna
let Lee run wild like that?</i>

01:12:48.406 --> 01:12:51.159
<i>Feeling cocky because of
a security detail at the car wash?</i>

01:12:51.701 --> 01:12:54.621
<i>I should've slit her throat
when I had the chance</i>

01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:57.082
Who the fuck are you?

01:12:57.082 --> 01:13:00.502
<i>Really?
You still don't know?</i>

01:13:00.502 --> 01:13:04.130
'I'm the real killer,
help me convince the world',

01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:05.632
is that why you called?

01:13:05.632 --> 01:13:08.134
<i>Of course,
you're my ace in the hole</i>

01:13:08.802 --> 01:13:12.055
<i>That's why I let you live,
you forgot?</i>

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:14.974
Are you getting worked up?

01:13:15.767 --> 01:13:18.686
The killer I chased was a calm fucker

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:24.359
<i>Why do you insist
Jung Su-yun's dead?</i>

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:36.663
Hello?

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:37.956
What?

01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:41.835
Are you serious?

01:13:45.130 --> 01:13:47.048
Could you tell us how you feel now?

01:13:47.048 --> 01:13:49.759
Are the hospital staff treating you well?

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:55.014
You claim that stole your knife
from your room, is this true?

01:13:55.181 --> 01:14:00.437
Yes! I think he went after
the rights to my identity

01:14:00.603 --> 01:14:02.772
but he couldn't be any more wrong

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:09.028
Today, I plan to donate
the entire $21 million that I earned

01:14:09.028 --> 01:14:12.532
through the sale of my book
to the victims' families

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:14.367
whose lives I caused so much pain

01:14:15.243 --> 01:14:17.537
What a fucking load of shit!!

01:14:17.537 --> 01:14:19.038
Who's gonna clean that mess!

01:14:19.038 --> 01:14:22.709
<i>And I do not wish to press charges</i>

01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:24.502
<i>against the Woman who attacked me</i>

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:28.214
Looks like my baby will be released

01:14:28.214 --> 01:14:31.718
Did he really... repent for what he did?

01:14:31.718 --> 01:14:35.889
Maybe... It doesn't look like
a simple publicity stunt

01:14:35.889 --> 01:14:38.099
It's all due to my past crimes...

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:42.145
He's not trying to
get rich off the book,

01:14:42.562 --> 01:14:46.566
he'll definitely open a restaurant soon

01:14:46.566 --> 01:14:49.652
But what kind?
Sushi? Or barbecue?

01:14:49.736 --> 01:14:52.322
Ah, steak house! It's perfect!

01:14:52.322 --> 01:14:55.867
Lee Doo-suk Steak House,
can't you feel it? No?

01:14:55.867 --> 01:14:58.203
- What? Is that true?
- What? Where?

01:14:58.203 --> 01:14:59.954
Live broadcast? Now?

01:15:30.318 --> 01:15:33.613
Are you hoping to get into politics?

01:15:33.613 --> 01:15:37.534
Pretending to be humble
by taking credit for my work

01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:40.286
<i>Let me make a suggest/on</i>

01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:45.291
Idiot cop, great actor and I,

01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:49.337
how about a three-way chat?
On national television

01:15:49.337 --> 01:15:54.842
Mr. Lee, it'll be a good chance for you
to prove your claim,

01:15:54.842 --> 01:15:56.761
will you accept?

01:15:56.886 --> 01:16:00.598
Do you accept the mediation?

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:03.977
He's an interesting character

01:16:05.812 --> 01:16:09.190
Sure, I'll accept

01:16:23.997 --> 01:16:28.668
J! Give us your number!

01:16:40.471 --> 01:16:45.435
<i>Under me is the evidence
that'll prove that I'm the real killer</i>

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:51.524
<i>I'll forward the location
3 hours before the debate</i>

01:16:57.405 --> 01:17:00.199
<i>What are you...</i>

01:17:01.034 --> 01:17:05.705
<i>Why are you writing on the tree?</i>

01:17:05.705 --> 01:17:09.834
<i>Hey you! What're you doing?</i>

01:17:13.004 --> 01:17:17.008
Comply to all his requests,
and put 10 guards on him

01:17:17.717 --> 01:17:19.385
Can't let anything happen to him

01:17:20.345 --> 01:17:23.222
Do-hyuk will go undercover as TV crew

01:17:23.222 --> 01:17:24.724
You'll disguise as forklift operator

01:17:24.724 --> 01:17:29.270
and pretend to install blockades
with me at the station

01:17:30.188 --> 01:17:31.856
What about her?

01:17:31.856 --> 01:17:34.400
I'll be in the audience

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.070
What, gonna clap and cheer?

01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:40.907
If you allow me, once he's verified,

01:17:41.949 --> 01:17:43.910
I would like to kill him myself

01:17:46.621 --> 01:17:47.580
Seriously?

01:17:48.081 --> 01:17:53.419
You won't find your daughter's body then

01:17:54.295 --> 01:17:56.005
I will bury her,

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:04.055
in my heart

01:18:07.392 --> 01:18:08.434
Sir...

01:18:13.398 --> 01:18:14.941
What's this?

01:18:28.955 --> 01:18:34.961
<i>Today is the day of Public Debate
that'll get to the bottom of this mystery</i>

01:18:34.961 --> 01:18:42.135
<i>The debate will determine
who the real killer of a cold case is</i>

01:18:42.135 --> 01:18:45.805
<i>Lt. Choi, who was
in charge of the in vestigation,</i>

01:18:45.805 --> 01:18:50.560
<i>as Well as the author of confessional
'Confession of Murder' Lee Doo-suk,</i>

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:54.355
<i>and J, who sent in
never before seen evidence,</i>

01:18:54.355 --> 01:18:59.277
<i>J will all attend in person
to uncover the truth once and for all</i>

01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:08.161
Choi, one of them is the real killer,
so don't lose him!

01:19:08.161 --> 01:19:11.998
I don't care if it's live broadcast,
I'll take full responsibility

01:19:16.461 --> 01:19:20.631
Lee Doo-suk is the real killer!
Real killer! Real killer!

01:19:20.631 --> 01:19:25.178
J is an impostor!
Impostor!! Impostor!

01:19:39.066 --> 01:19:41.569
Why is that witch here?

01:19:48.159 --> 01:19:49.911
<i>Everyone get ready!</i>

01:19:49.911 --> 01:19:55.124
<i>Since J isn't here yet
we'll start with the victims' families</i>

01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:57.084
<i>Standby!</i>

01:19:58.461 --> 01:19:59.545
<i>5</i>

01:19:59.545 --> 01:20:00.713
<i>4</i>

01:20:00.713 --> 01:20:02.131
<i>3</i>

01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:03.549
<i>2</i>

01:20:03.549 --> 01:20:04.550
<i>1</i>

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:05.676
Cue!

01:20:06.677 --> 01:20:11.057
Welcome to Public Debate,
I am your host Son Jong-hak

01:20:11.057 --> 01:20:16.395
Today we will find out once and for all,
who the real serial killer is

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:20.733
by talking to Lee Doo-suk,
Lt. Choi Hyung-go and J,

01:20:20.733 --> 01:20:25.279
who claims that Lee is taking credit
for his crimes

01:20:25.363 --> 01:20:29.200
We've received a word from J
that he's almost at the station

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:33.162
We apologize on his behalf for his absence

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:37.333
We'll start the debate
with Dr. Kim Joon-bum,

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:39.627
as the representative
of the victims' families

01:20:39.627 --> 01:20:41.170
What are you waiting for?

01:20:43.256 --> 01:20:44.674
Get him the mike!

01:20:52.056 --> 01:20:59.564
I haven't yet let my deceased daughter
out of my mind and heart

01:21:06.654 --> 01:21:08.865
Producer Park, J is at the back entrance

01:21:08.865 --> 01:21:11.284
Then dispatch the cams to the back!

01:21:17.290 --> 01:21:20.585
- Knowing the real killer would...
- One moment

01:21:21.335 --> 01:21:24.380
Ladies and gentlemen,
J has just arrived

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.132
We have the footage now

01:21:29.468 --> 01:21:32.972
J is approaching the studio

01:21:34.974 --> 01:21:37.059
Get out! get out!

01:21:40.521 --> 01:21:43.274
The mask is very striking

01:21:44.942 --> 01:21:46.777
Okay, he's here

01:21:57.997 --> 01:21:59.999
J is him...

01:22:00.124 --> 01:22:02.835
J will be arriving shortly

01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:15.014
This way, please sit over there

01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:31.656
Please be quiet for a moment

01:22:32.198 --> 01:22:33.240
Mr.J

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:36.202
As you're here to prove your identity,

01:22:36.202 --> 01:22:39.705
will you comply to the request
to remove your mask?

01:22:51.717 --> 01:22:55.721
J has finally revealed
his face to the world

01:22:55.721 --> 01:22:58.391
Lt. Choi, how do you feel?

01:23:02.395 --> 01:23:05.982
Is Jung Su-yun alive?

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:11.404
You'll find that out soon

01:23:12.613 --> 01:23:15.199
It's true that I killed 10 women,

01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:21.414
so perhaps] killed Ms. Jung

01:23:21.998 --> 01:23:25.876
The truth will be revealed soon

01:23:30.923 --> 01:23:33.759
Sir, I think that's J's signal

01:23:33.759 --> 01:23:34.719
OK!

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:40.433
We're ready to connect
to the off site feed!

01:23:41.183 --> 01:23:45.521
<i>As per J is" request,
we have crew standing b y</i>

01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:48.774
- <i>Let's connect to them now.
- Remote</i> feed, <i>cue!</i>

01:23:49.358 --> 01:23:53.696
<i>We are at a hill near Ansan</i>

01:23:53.696 --> 01:23:57.324
<i>We received a report that
Ms. Jung Su-yun,</i>

01:23:57.324 --> 01:23:59.744
<i>the 11th victim
of the serial killing is buried here,</i>

01:23:59.744 --> 01:24:02.246
<i>and begun the excavation</i>

01:24:02.663 --> 01:24:03.873
<i>As you see behind me...</i>

01:24:03.873 --> 01:24:07.752
Looks like we found something

01:24:09.962 --> 01:24:13.466
<i>We finally see a glimpse
of the remains</i>

01:24:13.966 --> 01:24:15.718
<i>After 17 long years,</i>

01:24:16.343 --> 01:24:19.013
<i>she can finally rest peacefully</i>

01:24:19.013 --> 01:24:22.516
<i>You're Watching
live excavation of Jung Su-yun</i>

01:24:25.061 --> 01:24:31.233
She was wearing a white coat
at the time of her abduction

01:24:31.317 --> 01:24:32.985
You fucking!

01:24:33.152 --> 01:24:34.779
<i>Take this</i>

01:24:36.155 --> 01:24:37.948
<i>I believe in you</i>

01:24:37.948 --> 01:24:40.034
<i>Friendship is your support</i>

01:24:40.367 --> 01:24:42.661
<i>Orion Chocopie</i>

01:24:43.829 --> 01:24:47.416
That J bastard must be the real killer!

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:50.336
No, don't give up hope!

01:24:52.129 --> 01:24:54.715
Test, test.

01:24:55.883 --> 01:25:00.054
Don't lose faith in Lee!

01:25:00.054 --> 01:25:01.514
Don't lose faith!

01:25:01.847 --> 01:25:05.976
J must've killed just her,
and Lee killed the rest!

01:25:08.687 --> 01:25:12.066
Lieutenant, don't get so emotional

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:14.735
Let's be rational about this

01:25:17.196 --> 01:25:22.076
You're making it look like
he's the real thing

01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:24.495
Everyone, please calm down

01:25:24.495 --> 01:25:26.247
We're back in 4 and a half minutes

01:25:26.247 --> 01:25:28.791
Step off the stage, please!

01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:30.835
What are you doing?!

01:25:31.335 --> 01:25:33.546
Who said to interrupt the show!

01:25:33.546 --> 01:25:36.715
We almost allowed profanity on live TV!

01:25:36.715 --> 01:25:39.635
This is not on the scale of
normal broadcast accidents!

01:25:39.635 --> 01:25:41.470
Do you know how much
this is costing us?

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:42.596
Chief!

01:25:42.596 --> 01:25:45.432
FCC will press charges,
and there won't be a show!

01:25:45.599 --> 01:25:47.893
If we continue like this,
aren't I fucked?

01:25:47.893 --> 01:25:50.062
I don't know...

01:25:50.062 --> 01:25:51.355
If not you, then who?

01:25:51.355 --> 01:25:53.691
Chief said he'll take care of everything

01:25:53.691 --> 01:25:55.526
That bastard...

01:25:55.526 --> 01:25:57.236
I'm the station chief

01:25:57.236 --> 01:25:58.571
Clear out your desk!

01:25:59.613 --> 01:26:01.740
Fuck this, I'm done!

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.617
- Producer Park, don't do this!
- Let go!

01:26:03.617 --> 01:26:06.203
Broadcast is power?
Eat your own shit!

01:26:06.203 --> 01:26:07.413
Get out!

01:26:10.166 --> 01:26:11.292
Lieutenant,

01:26:11.917 --> 01:26:15.963
you didn't actually think that
she was still alive, right?

01:26:18.048 --> 01:26:19.758
You son of a bitch!

01:26:20.759 --> 01:26:22.469
Come out!

01:26:22.469 --> 01:26:24.013
You're fucking dead!

01:26:24.263 --> 01:26:26.140
Out of the way!

01:26:29.268 --> 01:26:30.561
Motherfucker!

01:26:32.188 --> 01:26:36.567
Do-hyuk, that's enough...

01:26:36.942 --> 01:26:40.279
I'm gonna find him and kill him!

01:26:42.823 --> 01:26:48.787
More women are being killed
because I haven't stopped him yet

01:26:49.038 --> 01:26:51.123
Honey! Look at my face

01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:54.960
Look at me

01:26:57.796 --> 01:27:00.299
Yo! Jung Su-yun!

01:27:00.299 --> 01:27:04.303
I'm getting the short end of the stick,

01:27:04.303 --> 01:27:07.556
but since you need me so desperately,

01:27:08.182 --> 01:27:11.810
I, Choi Hyung-go, will

01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:14.230
marry you!

01:27:14.396 --> 01:27:16.649
Can't we live together?

01:27:17.316 --> 01:27:20.319
I want to live together!

01:27:21.487 --> 01:27:28.369
I never said that.
Sounds nothing like me

01:27:31.997 --> 01:27:33.332
Don't be too hard on yourself

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:34.750
I got it

01:27:37.002 --> 01:27:38.712
Mom'll be here soon

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:42.299
What time is it?

01:27:44.093 --> 01:27:45.761
It's dead again

01:27:45.761 --> 01:27:47.513
I'll buy you a new watch

01:27:47.513 --> 01:27:51.308
It works great with some care, like me

01:27:51.308 --> 01:27:53.519
Then I need to give you some love too

01:28:06.073 --> 01:28:07.324
Feel better?

01:28:09.618 --> 01:28:10.744
Go on in

01:28:10.744 --> 01:28:12.538
There's that smile

01:28:12.538 --> 01:28:14.373
Go on

01:28:14.373 --> 01:28:15.541
Okay, I'm off

01:28:31.307 --> 01:28:32.599
Hello

01:28:32.683 --> 01:28:35.436
Have I not made myself clear?

01:28:36.562 --> 01:28:41.942
I thought it'd be dangerous
for her to walk home alone

01:28:41.942 --> 01:28:45.529
Being with you is more dangerous

01:28:46.322 --> 01:28:48.824
<i>Shall we? It's almost time</i>

01:28:55.748 --> 01:29:00.753
I can only imagine your shock
as you witness this at home

01:29:01.086 --> 01:29:06.175
DNA test must be conducted
before we can verify that this is Jung

01:29:06.425 --> 01:29:07.760
Are you kidding?

01:29:09.928 --> 01:29:14.391
Do I have to cook the meal
and feed it to you too?

01:29:19.563 --> 01:29:23.233
Lt. Choi, it's just a matter of time,

01:29:23.317 --> 01:29:25.778
why don't you just come clean now?

01:29:26.612 --> 01:29:27.738
Lt. Choi?

01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:31.784
Then Mr. Lee,

01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:38.040
do you still stand by your statement
that you killed 10 women?

01:29:47.508 --> 01:29:48.509
I...

01:29:48.509 --> 01:29:50.511
Yes, go on

01:29:51.970 --> 01:29:54.640
am not...

01:29:58.185 --> 01:29:59.770
the serial killer

01:30:01.355 --> 01:30:04.233
You... are not the serial killer?

01:30:07.444 --> 01:30:08.654
Quiet please

01:30:09.154 --> 01:30:10.739
Please be quiet!

01:30:11.490 --> 01:30:14.827
This is all very confusing

01:30:14.827 --> 01:30:21.250
Then how were you able to
obtain vivid details of the case

01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:23.752
that only the real killer would know?

01:30:27.172 --> 01:30:28.924
Because I...

01:30:31.385 --> 01:30:32.761
did not write it

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:37.349
Then who wrote the book?

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:46.191
I wrote the book

01:30:49.111 --> 01:30:51.155
What are you saying?

01:30:53.323 --> 01:30:55.742
Lee Doo-suk's real name is Jung Hyun-sik

01:30:57.494 --> 01:30:58.871
The first victim was...

01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:06.003
my mother

01:31:07.296 --> 01:31:08.338
Wait a moment...

01:31:09.548 --> 01:31:10.966
This is Jung Hyun-sik's file

01:31:11.925 --> 01:31:17.556
We researched the victims' families,
and found out that

01:31:17.973 --> 01:31:21.351
the son of first victim, Jung Hyun-sik,

01:31:21.351 --> 01:31:25.189
died in an accident on the year
when the statute of limitations expired

01:31:25.981 --> 01:31:31.904
That day, Jung died and
Lee was born in his place

01:31:33.197 --> 01:31:38.869
But there's not a trace of similarity
between the two

01:31:38.869 --> 01:31:43.081
I can explain that

01:31:44.875 --> 01:31:46.627
It was winter of 2005

01:31:47.294 --> 01:31:53.300
We were barely able to stabilize him,

01:31:55.260 --> 01:32:00.182
but his face took a serious damage
that required reconstructive surgery

01:32:00.474 --> 01:32:04.937
So you created Lee with plastic surgery?

01:32:05.771 --> 01:32:10.901
It was Choi's suggestion
and Hyun-sik also wanted it

01:32:11.693 --> 01:32:16.949
So Lt. Choi planned this scheme
to weed out the real killer?

01:32:16.949 --> 01:32:19.743
Even writing a book as part of the plan...

01:32:24.831 --> 01:32:30.212
You're a megalomaniac
who desires national attention

01:32:30.963 --> 01:32:37.177
So you chose to kill
and I became part of your PR stunt

01:32:39.555 --> 01:32:43.767
If someone became famous
with that book,

01:32:45.561 --> 01:32:48.522
who'd be most jealous of it?

01:32:51.650 --> 01:32:52.943
I am so thankful,

01:32:55.404 --> 01:32:57.030
I am so thankful,

01:33:00.617 --> 01:33:02.452
that you bit the bait so willingly

01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:20.554
Lt. Choi, I'm stunned,
I underestimated you

01:33:21.179 --> 01:33:28.520
But with me legally off the hook,
why did you go through the trouble?

01:33:29.688 --> 01:33:32.899
Oh, is it because of her?

01:33:34.943 --> 01:33:36.320
Jung Su-yun?

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:41.325
I needed to catch you!
And ask you,

01:33:43.535 --> 01:33:48.915
whether she's dead or alive,
and where she's buried

01:33:51.209 --> 01:33:53.712
Then I was going to kill you

01:33:54.963 --> 01:33:58.884
But that's not what she would've wanted,

01:34:01.011 --> 01:34:03.013
so I'm hesitating now...

01:34:08.393 --> 01:34:10.228
What do you mean?

01:34:14.066 --> 01:34:15.400
Bring it

01:34:20.947 --> 01:34:23.408
I don't know why you're making a scene

01:34:24.743 --> 01:34:26.745
Just show us already,

01:34:27.788 --> 01:34:29.247
and get it over with

01:34:30.666 --> 01:34:32.501
Please let me...

01:34:35.879 --> 01:34:38.256
hear his voice one last time

01:34:40.801 --> 01:34:45.097
<i>Violent Crimes
Hello? Hello?</i>

01:34:46.598 --> 01:34:49.476
<i>Why did you hit the victim then!</i>

01:34:49.768 --> 01:34:52.562
I know where you're going with this

01:34:52.813 --> 01:34:57.275
You want to stir up public emotion,
is that it?

01:34:58.610 --> 01:35:02.781
That I'm the devil who mercilessly killed
an innocent woman?

01:35:05.909 --> 01:35:10.997
It feels even more tragic
with your voice in it

01:35:10.997 --> 01:35:13.291
You must be really nervous now...

01:35:15.293 --> 01:35:17.462
Shut your trap and listen

01:35:24.219 --> 01:35:27.431
<i>- Hello? Hello?
- The ballat count for...</i>

01:35:27.431 --> 01:35:31.017
<i>14th presidential electron is
being conducted</i>

01:35:31.017 --> 01:35:33.145
<i>We'll continue shortly</i>

01:35:33.145 --> 01:35:36.231
<i>- It is now midnight.
- Hello? What do you want?</i>

01:35:37.858 --> 01:35:39.651
Speak!

01:35:41.695 --> 01:35:43.113
Did you hear it?

01:35:44.489 --> 01:35:46.992
The 14th presidential election ballot count

01:35:47.743 --> 01:35:51.663
That was midnight December 19, 1992

01:35:52.497 --> 01:35:56.418
Today is December 18, 2007,

01:35:56.418 --> 01:35:58.754
11:46pm

01:35:59.713 --> 01:36:04.384
There's still 14 more minutes of
statute of limitations!

01:36:04.384 --> 01:36:05.844
Lieutenant!

01:36:12.225 --> 01:36:16.688
We became close
while living together for 2 years

01:36:20.150 --> 01:36:22.027
She always said,

01:36:23.695 --> 01:36:28.825
she wanted you to live on
without guilt

01:36:31.703 --> 01:36:39.002
She thought of you
until the moment she was buried

01:36:59.064 --> 01:37:04.486
I'm sorry,
please forgive me

01:37:05.904 --> 01:37:07.906
Please let me live

01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:11.576
I want to live...

01:37:16.331 --> 01:37:21.586
I have to live

01:37:28.301 --> 01:37:36.685
There is a reason why I must live

01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:46.611
No, you can't kill me

01:37:50.407 --> 01:37:56.204
I have... your child

01:38:04.671 --> 01:38:06.131
Shut your mouth!

01:38:24.941 --> 01:38:28.153
Goddammit, that hurts!

01:38:32.073 --> 01:38:34.993
Blood...

01:38:35.702 --> 01:38:41.333
I was mindful of her period,
but she ended up getting pregnant

01:38:42.334 --> 01:38:44.711
She thought I wouldn't kill her with a child

01:38:45.462 --> 01:38:48.465
But I loathe children more than anything

01:38:53.094 --> 01:38:56.181
Looks like you went all out
for her revenge,

01:38:57.182 --> 01:38:59.684
but you should've done it
before time ran out

01:38:59.684 --> 01:39:03.188
You didn't have to drag me out on TV,

01:39:04.189 --> 01:39:05.690
this is so pitiful!

01:39:06.858 --> 01:39:08.193
Please lower your gun...

01:39:09.277 --> 01:39:10.612
Sir...

01:39:11.196 --> 01:39:13.615
It's all over now

01:39:19.454 --> 01:39:20.830
You're right,

01:39:22.832 --> 01:39:24.250
I was wrong

01:39:28.129 --> 01:39:29.839
I shouldn't be so pitiful

01:39:32.175 --> 01:39:33.259
Right?

01:39:34.386 --> 01:39:36.596
Not in her loving memory...

01:39:37.263 --> 01:39:38.515
It's my fault

01:39:40.058 --> 01:39:44.562
But this is the end for us!

01:39:45.021 --> 01:39:46.147
No, Lieutenant!

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:49.484
Let go!

01:39:51.653 --> 01:39:54.114
- Let go of me!
- Please calm down!

01:40:03.999 --> 01:40:07.585
Su-yun's mother's blood
is on your hand now

01:40:39.951 --> 01:40:41.953
Take the other side!

01:40:52.839 --> 01:40:54.674
Your mom said to me as she died,

01:40:55.884 --> 01:40:58.344
her son would be all alone...

01:40:59.012 --> 01:41:00.930
You grew up quite well

01:41:00.930 --> 01:41:02.807
Shut the fuck up!

01:41:38.051 --> 01:41:39.260
Shit!

01:41:47.852 --> 01:41:49.771
I'll kill you!

01:41:53.691 --> 01:41:54.901
Goddammit!

01:41:58.154 --> 01:41:59.114
Stop!

01:42:00.406 --> 01:42:01.825
Stop right there!

01:42:08.039 --> 01:42:10.542
Hold still!

01:42:17.090 --> 01:42:17.924
Fuck!

01:42:19.134 --> 01:42:20.218
Fucking hell!

01:42:25.056 --> 01:42:26.307
Fuck!

01:42:37.527 --> 01:42:38.987
Fucking hell!

01:42:40.238 --> 01:42:41.781
I'll fucking kill you!

01:42:58.590 --> 01:43:00.133
Just load the whole thing!

01:43:13.104 --> 01:43:15.273
Underneath!

01:43:15.273 --> 01:43:16.900
Crush him!

01:43:23.656 --> 01:43:25.825
Key! Give me the key!

01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:30.413
Give it back!
That's not mine

01:43:42.508 --> 01:43:43.760
Move it!

01:43:55.980 --> 01:43:57.148
Godammit!

01:44:21.839 --> 01:44:23.841
No, I'm so fucked...

01:44:25.218 --> 01:44:26.261
Are you okay?

01:44:26.970 --> 01:44:28.221
Are you alive?

01:44:29.931 --> 01:44:30.974
You Okay?

01:44:31.975 --> 01:44:33.142
I know you...

01:44:33.226 --> 01:44:35.144
Lt. Choi, right?

01:44:38.147 --> 01:44:39.482
Sir, are you okay?

01:44:39.899 --> 01:44:41.150
Are you hurt?

01:44:47.573 --> 01:44:48.366
Fuck!

<i>J is seen heading towards Ilsan
on a stolen motorcycle</i>

01:45:50.428 --> 01:45:52.847
Where the fuck is he?!

01:46:39.644 --> 01:46:41.312
Fucking hell!

01:47:00.415 --> 01:47:02.208
Go to hell!

01:48:06.564 --> 01:48:10.067
It's all over in 3 minutes, fucker!

01:48:13.571 --> 01:48:17.074
I'll fucking kill you!

01:48:53.736 --> 01:48:55.112
Lieutenant!

01:48:57.073 --> 01:48:59.951
Are you okay?

01:49:00.243 --> 01:49:02.286
Come down! please!

01:49:06.958 --> 01:49:07.959
Hold them back!

01:49:47.957 --> 01:49:49.667
Block him!

01:49:54.046 --> 01:49:54.964
Let go!

01:50:07.435 --> 01:50:12.023
Let me go!
He has to die!

01:50:14.650 --> 01:50:16.402
Let go!

01:52:00.548 --> 01:52:01.966
Sorry for making you wait

01:52:02.049 --> 01:52:03.676
Why are you so late?

01:52:04.677 --> 01:52:09.181
I'm bogged down with the case,
I have to rush back

01:52:10.307 --> 01:52:11.767
What should we eat?

01:52:13.728 --> 01:52:17.815
Why don't you just quit now?

01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:22.987
Not even a proper dinner
with your lover on Christmas eve

01:52:24.488 --> 01:52:29.118
How will you ever marry
a cop this way?

01:52:30.327 --> 01:52:32.121
I'm starting to understand your mother

01:52:34.999 --> 01:52:39.837
If you do, then breaking up is an option?

01:52:45.509 --> 01:52:47.470
My mom bothers you that much?

01:52:48.512 --> 01:52:49.847
Come on

01:52:55.019 --> 01:52:57.021
I...

01:53:00.483 --> 01:53:02.193
want to...

01:53:05.362 --> 01:53:07.156
live with you

01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:12.411
Go on, I gotta run

01:53:16.207 --> 01:53:19.168
Can't even take me home?

01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:31.931
It'd be awkward to see your mother

01:53:36.268 --> 01:53:39.730
You're selfish
