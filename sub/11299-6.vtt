We are on our way

Don't worry, I'll have Jeremiah

00:21.661 --> 00:23.027
I'd like for you
to advise the campaign.

00:23.062 --> 00:24.362
All right, I want you
to be part of this.

- [Ron] Oh, hi.

00:26.983 --> 00:29.100
I got your message
last night, man.

00:29.135 --> 00:31.202

I forgot my key card

01:06.072 --> 01:07.154
- Key card?
- Yeah.

You know, I just keep
it around my neck.

How was the cruise?

Anchors aweigh, huh?
Anchors aweigh.

01:30.513 --> 01:32.513
Yeah, it wasn't really
that kind of a trip, Ron.

- Sorry, all right, all right.
- Okay?

01:33.967 --> 01:36.300
I had no idea I'd be coming
back to fucking Quantico.

01:36.352 --> 01:37.969
I mean, what
clearance level

01:38.021 --> 01:39.604
do I need to walk into
my own goddamn office?

01:39.639 --> 01:40.805
Did you get my e-mails?

01:40.807 --> 01:42.873
Yeah, I got about 200
of the fucking things.

01:42.909 --> 01:44.892
I hired you
to mind the store.

01:44.944 --> 01:46.477
Not turn it into
fucking Gitmo.

01:46.479 --> 01:49.113
Yeah, well, your store is
in a sketchy hood, Marty.

01:49.148 --> 01:52.149
And it's rampant with cyber
theft, corporate espionage.

01:52.201 --> 01:55.386
These upgraded security measures
are how you stay in business,

and the Kohl brothers.

02:01.160 --> 02:02.460
Uh-huh.

02:02.495 --> 02:04.328
Also positions you rather
nicely to take over

02:04.330 --> 02:05.329
once I leave, huh?

02:05.331 --> 02:06.330
Well, you know.

02:06.332 --> 02:07.331
- Big shoes to fill, man.
- Yeah.

02:07.333 --> 02:08.666
What, are you a size 12, 13?

02:08.717 --> 02:10.001
[chuckles] Hey, Ron, is it hard
for you to breathe like that?

02:10.053 --> 02:11.402
What do you mean?

02:11.437 --> 02:13.771
You know, with your nose jammed
all the way up my ass.

02:13.806 --> 02:16.057
[wry laugh] So I hear you're
about to close Delcour, huh?

02:16.092 --> 02:20.227
Huh? Getting our cosmetic
index all engorged

02:20.263 --> 02:21.779

fuck is wrong with you?

02:24.117 --> 02:25.950
Not a goddamn thing.

02:25.985 --> 02:27.902
Good luck today.

02:27.937 --> 02:29.153
[Clyde]
So you think voters will

02:29.188 --> 02:31.022
just trade in their keys
for a bus pass?

02:31.074 --> 02:33.524
Los Angeles loses its way
as a first-class city

02:33.576 --> 02:35.409
if we're relying on cars to
drive us into the future.

02:35.445 --> 02:37.578
I hear you; I understand
what you're saying,

02:37.613 --> 02:39.697
but launching major initiatives
in... what do we have?

02:39.749 --> 02:41.165
Public transportation,

02:41.200 --> 02:44.785
water conservation, and school
reform in your first term?

02:44.837 --> 02:46.137
Dude, it's gonna break the bank.

02:46.172 --> 02:49.373
Seth, please, you have
to set priorities.

02:49.425 --> 02:50.424
They're all priorities.

02:50.460 --> 02:52.610
What if...
one of them wasn't?

02:52.645 --> 02:53.711
[laughs]

02:53.713 --> 02:54.845
They're all gonna face
stiff oppositions.

02:54.881 --> 02:56.047
I know that.

02:56.049 --> 02:57.214
Look, that's what
I'm talking about.

02:57.216 --> 02:59.050
I mean, in our current
political culture,

02:59.102 --> 03:00.634
we've internalized the "no."

03:00.687 --> 03:02.053
We don't reach for things
anymore, because

03:02.105 --> 03:03.487
what's the point?
Nothing's gonna

03:03.523 --> 03:05.690
come of it, anyway,
so why even try?

03:05.725 --> 03:08.142
But when we stop shooting
for the moon,

03:08.194 --> 03:10.294
I tell you, man, we...
we die as a society.

03:10.329 --> 03:12.563
Oh! If I weren't
holding this bagel,

03:12.615 --> 03:13.564
I would slow-clap

03:13.616 --> 03:15.733

03:15.735 --> 03:17.968
Um, Clyde, we're getting
ready to head out.

03:18.004 --> 03:20.171
You two will have to continue
crafting empty promises later.

03:20.206 --> 03:21.238
Well, now, wait a second.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.306
What makes you think
they're empty?

03:22.341 --> 03:23.824
Um...

To tell us

more about your concerns.

to hear them.

bit of cream cheese...

- You, too.
- And you know what?

- I think that is everybody.
- No, not quite everybody.

on out, I'm telling you,

04:35.898 --> 04:38.032
Why would you call Jeannie?

Well, why do you think
I'd call her?

I'm assuming
you have her number?

the custard in.

If y'all are still hungry,

07:41.000 --> 07:42.833
I left a sack of dicks
you can munch on

07:42.835 --> 07:44.335
back at the clubhouse.

07:45.504 --> 07:46.553
- [Devin whoops]
- Hey, keep it up.

07:46.589 --> 07:47.721
- All right, you too, man.
- Keep it up.

07:47.757 --> 07:48.722
Keep it up and
that money's ours.

07:48.758 --> 07:50.174
Start that on the green, hard.

07:50.176 --> 07:53.844
Rita, you ever see a movie
called <i>The Color of Money?</i>

07:53.846 --> 07:55.179
You know, if you're gonna
hustle somebody,

07:55.181 --> 07:56.513
you actually have to
start making shots.

07:56.565 --> 07:57.765
I mean, you can golf, right?

07:57.817 --> 07:59.316
You need to chill
the fuck out, Marty.

07:59.352 --> 08:00.434
I got this.

08:00.486 --> 08:02.486
Just go hit another
one of your shitty ones.

08:02.521 --> 08:03.620
[Devin]
I may skip

08:03.656 --> 08:05.072
this Delcour deal, Marty.

08:05.107 --> 08:07.491
I can make more money, uh,
playing golf with your friends.

08:07.526 --> 08:08.492
[both laughing]

08:08.527 --> 08:09.493
[Marty]
Oh, uh,

08:09.528 --> 08:10.494
she's not my friend, okay?

08:10.529 --> 08:11.996
She's dating my dad.

08:12.031 --> 08:14.415
[dramatic gasp] Oh, you brought
your stepmother to play golf.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.100
- That is so sweet.
- [Marty chuckles]

08:16.135 --> 08:18.268
Not actually
my stepmother, either.

08:18.304 --> 08:19.453
Okay. All right.

08:19.505 --> 08:21.088
Change is hardest
on the children.

08:21.123 --> 08:22.506
- [Donald] Hmm.
- [laughing]

08:22.541 --> 08:24.591
Rita, before I forget,
my wife wants to get

08:24.627 --> 08:26.093
something called a blowout?

08:26.128 --> 08:27.761
Yeah, she said she wants
to keep it all natural.

08:27.797 --> 08:29.346
Can you give me
a recommendation to a salon

08:29.382 --> 08:30.347
or something like that?

08:30.383 --> 08:31.765
Oh, yes, she should check out...

08:31.801 --> 08:33.517
Well, it all depends on the
texture of the hair, you know.

08:33.552 --> 08:35.052
No, no, go ahead,
'cause you know more

08:35.054 --> 08:36.220
about black women's hair
than me.

08:36.272 --> 08:38.355
Well, take Rita here,
you know?

08:38.390 --> 08:40.224
She's got real shiny curls,

08:40.226 --> 08:41.692
and I tell you, man,
this...

08:41.727 --> 08:43.059
look how healthy
this hair is, really.

08:43.062 --> 08:44.227
And the color is great, too.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.230
You must use a deep
conditioning treatment...

08:46.282 --> 08:47.831
something...
this is amazing.

08:47.867 --> 08:51.135
Where did you say you
were from again? De-Detroit?

08:51.170 --> 08:52.236
Yeah, yeah. You?

08:52.238 --> 08:53.303
Oh, uh, Virginia.

08:53.339 --> 08:54.738
But I heard
about this place,

08:54.740 --> 08:56.407
um, the Carriage House...

08:56.409 --> 08:58.642
it's supposed to have the
best soul food in Detroit.

08:58.677 --> 09:00.077
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
No, that place is the bomb.

09:00.079 --> 09:01.078
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.212
[Marty]
Hey, black Zagat's.

09:02.248 --> 09:03.347
Can we golf?

09:03.382 --> 09:05.132
[all talking at once]

09:05.167 --> 09:06.583
Yeah, I didn't know
we was that loud.

09:06.585 --> 09:07.718
Come on, man!

09:12.308 --> 09:13.991
- Oh, get... get!
- Oh, no...

09:14.026 --> 09:16.593
- Oh, man. That's not good.
- Come on, man.

09:16.645 --> 09:17.928
- [Donald] Marty, close the face.
- Yeah, I know.

09:17.980 --> 09:18.979
- Close the face down.
- I know.

09:19.014 --> 09:19.980
Oh, let me line you
up here, dawg.

09:20.015 --> 09:21.098
Nah, I got this,
big dawg.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.266
[Devin] I got you, man!
Come, let's do it!

09:22.268 --> 09:23.267
[Donald]
I notice you tend to put

09:23.269 --> 09:24.318
some backspin
on that bad boy.

09:24.353 --> 09:26.320
Uh, you might want
to check your boy.

09:26.355 --> 09:28.272
Which one?

09:28.274 --> 09:30.441
Devin. The white one.

09:30.493 --> 09:32.493
What the fuck are
you talking about?

09:32.528 --> 09:34.411
He looks black,
he says he's black,

09:34.447 --> 09:35.579
but he ain't black.

09:35.614 --> 09:37.114
The Carriage House
does not have

09:37.166 --> 09:38.682
the best soul food
in Detroit.

09:38.717 --> 09:40.834
Do you know why
I know that?

09:40.870 --> 09:43.087
Because the Carriage
House is in Chicago.

09:43.122 --> 09:45.722
What are you... What is this,
a Columbo act or something?

09:45.758 --> 09:49.593
Furthermore, that fake Negro
had his hand all up in my hair.

09:49.628 --> 09:52.963
Unless you're my stylist and
I'm sitting in your chair,

09:53.015 --> 09:55.599
I don't give a fuck what
you do for a living...

09:55.634 --> 09:58.135
you do not touch a
black woman's hair.

09:58.187 --> 10:00.871
Even you know that, Marty, and
you don't even date black women.

10:00.906 --> 10:02.439
- I...
- Stop.

10:02.475 --> 10:04.208
[Donald]
Oh, boy, oh, boy,

10:04.243 --> 10:06.193
- oh, boy!
- Oh, no.

10:06.228 --> 10:07.644
It's gonna be
a long day, brah.

10:07.646 --> 10:10.147
Oh, no, I can feel the money
just going in my pocket.

10:10.149 --> 10:12.316
- Shimmy, shimmy. Mm-hmm.
- Mmm.

10:12.368 --> 10:13.917
- This just feels so good.
- [Donald laughs]

10:13.953 --> 10:17.888
Why don't we play the back nine
at, uh, $300 a hole?

10:17.923 --> 10:19.873
- Oh, shit, by all means.
- Yeah. Yes.

10:19.909 --> 10:21.959
- Please, let's do.
- Listen, if you want to keep

10:21.994 --> 10:23.460
contributing to
my retirement fund,

10:23.496 --> 10:25.996
your money's
still green.

10:29.335 --> 10:30.584
- What the...?
- Oh, shit.

10:30.636 --> 10:32.219
You trying... you trying
to hustle us, Marty?

10:32.254 --> 10:33.437
A good shot.

10:33.472 --> 10:35.139
All right, now,
which one of you ass-clowns

10:35.174 --> 10:37.674
wants to be the mystical caddy
in my <i>Bagger Vance?</i>

10:37.726 --> 10:39.343
All-time top ten.

10:39.345 --> 10:42.679
Love that movie.

10:42.681 --> 10:45.182
A man's grip on his club
is like his grip on the world.

10:45.184 --> 10:46.483
- Uh-huh.
- Yes.

10:46.519 --> 10:47.901
He just said he
loved <i>Bagger Vance.</i>

10:47.937 --> 10:49.486
- Just...
- <i>The Legend of.</i>

10:49.522 --> 10:50.687
[golf club swings]

10:50.739 --> 10:52.189
[Doug]
<i>Well, the good news is</i>

10:52.191 --> 10:53.590
<i>Devin is in fact
African-American.</i>

10:53.626 --> 10:55.259
And the bad news?

10:55.294 --> 10:56.777
Well, African-American
in that

10:56.829 --> 10:58.962
his family emigrated
from Cape Town.

10:58.998 --> 11:01.114
So... you be the judge.

11:01.167 --> 11:04.585
I'd say his complexion's more
de Klerk than Mandela.

11:06.088 --> 11:08.005
[Jeannie]
Sorry.

11:08.040 --> 11:10.424
I forgot my fucking key card.

11:10.459 --> 11:12.543
What's going on?

11:12.595 --> 11:14.595
We have run into a little hitch
with this Delcour plan.

11:14.630 --> 11:16.129
I wouldn't use the word
"hitch" in this case.

11:16.182 --> 11:17.381
"Hitch" is probably
a strong word.

11:17.383 --> 11:18.432
It's more like a
moral quandary, really.

11:18.467 --> 11:19.449
That's a little better, yeah.

11:19.485 --> 11:21.552
You fucking pussies,
just say...

11:21.604 --> 11:23.787
Devin isn't black.

11:23.822 --> 11:25.622
Not-not black how?

11:26.609 --> 11:28.976
Johannesburg, 1972.

11:29.028 --> 11:30.327
A country torn asunder
by apartheid...

11:30.362 --> 11:31.628
What? Whoa.

11:31.664 --> 11:32.663
Doug.

11:32.698 --> 11:33.947
Oh.

11:33.983 --> 11:35.032
Marty,

11:35.067 --> 11:37.234
all your palling around
with this guy,

11:37.286 --> 11:38.819
and your black-dar
never went off?

11:38.871 --> 11:40.904
Whoa. What about your white-dar?

11:40.956 --> 11:42.039
It's pretty fucking
defective, too.

11:42.074 --> 11:44.508
- This guy is one of yours.
- [Doug] It's strange.

11:44.543 --> 11:46.410
I don't know why any white
person would want to be black.

11:46.462 --> 11:48.078
- Uh...
- Well, there's sports, of course.

11:48.130 --> 11:50.414
You know, basketball,
marathon running, all that jazz.

11:50.466 --> 11:51.748
- Uhp, there's another one, jazz.
- [groans]

11:51.800 --> 11:53.584
So what are we gonna do?

11:53.586 --> 11:55.085
Same thing we
did last time

11:55.087 --> 11:57.254
we had a black CEO
turn out to be white.

11:57.306 --> 11:59.506
So... no idea?

11:59.558 --> 12:01.425
No fucking idea.

12:01.427 --> 12:02.726
[sighs]

12:02.761 --> 12:05.896
People are
complicated, right?

12:05.931 --> 12:08.482
I mean, they can be
a real mix of...

12:08.517 --> 12:10.267
good qualities
and bad qualities.

12:10.319 --> 12:11.401
Really fucking deep, Clyde.

12:11.437 --> 12:12.502
I brought it up

12:12.538 --> 12:13.770
'cause I was thinking
about Seth.

12:13.822 --> 12:15.038
Remember Seth Buckley?

12:15.074 --> 12:18.041
On one hand, dude
is super smart

12:18.077 --> 12:19.910
with policies and politics,
but in his personal life,

12:19.945 --> 12:21.511
he just can't...
he can't take a hint.

12:21.547 --> 12:23.213
You obviously hate him.

12:23.249 --> 12:24.581
And he keeps pestering me
for your phone number,

12:24.617 --> 12:26.016
so I told him don't
even worry about it.

12:26.051 --> 12:27.584
I didn't give it to him.
We're good, okay?

12:27.620 --> 12:29.219
Hang on, hang on,
hang on, hang on.

12:30.422 --> 12:32.089
Seth wants to ask me out?

12:32.124 --> 12:34.424
Yeah, but we're good.
Bullet dodged.

12:34.460 --> 12:37.227
Seems like you really don't
want me to go out with him.

12:37.263 --> 12:38.895
What would make you...?

12:38.931 --> 12:41.632
Good, 'cause I'm gonna
fuck his brains out.

12:41.684 --> 12:43.850
Are you cool
if we used your bed?

12:43.886 --> 12:45.035
You're kidding, right?

12:45.070 --> 12:47.070
Am I?

12:47.106 --> 12:49.539
Jeannie. Jeannie, Jeannie.

12:49.575 --> 12:50.774
Jeannie, listen.

12:50.809 --> 12:53.110
Seth has a real shot
of being mayor,

12:53.145 --> 12:54.911
of being a great mayor.

12:54.947 --> 12:57.698
Now, I know you usually limit
your radius of human wreckage

12:57.733 --> 13:00.284
to your tiny circle
of friends and family,

13:00.319 --> 13:03.320
but this could have
atomic bomb repercussions

13:03.372 --> 13:05.822
on all of fucking Los Angeles.

13:05.874 --> 13:08.458
I don't know, Clyde, I really
like to play to a big room.

13:08.494 --> 13:11.061
Don't fuck things up for him.

13:11.096 --> 13:13.130
And by "him," you mean you.

13:14.300 --> 13:15.749
Don't worry, Clyde.

13:15.801 --> 13:17.768
I have no interest
in fucking your boyfriend.

13:17.803 --> 13:20.103
Thank you. Thank you.

13:20.139 --> 13:22.472
But just so you know, if you
want to fuck him in <i>my</i> bed,

13:22.508 --> 13:24.508
I'm cool with that.

13:28.981 --> 13:30.263
Marty, my man.

13:30.316 --> 13:31.848
- Oh, hey.
- [chuckles]

13:31.900 --> 13:33.266
- Hey.
- Thanks for coming in, man.

13:33.319 --> 13:35.185
Absolutely, man.
Whatever you need, brother.

13:35.237 --> 13:36.570
[chuckles]

13:36.605 --> 13:39.589
You and Rita really ran a game
on us this morning, man.

13:39.625 --> 13:42.576
[chuckles] Uh, speaking
of games, have a seat.

13:42.611 --> 13:44.428
[clears throat]

13:44.463 --> 13:47.748
- So, look, it's, uh...
- Mm-hmm.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.116
...it's just us
talking right now.

13:49.168 --> 13:50.367
Sure.

13:50.419 --> 13:52.836
Um, is there anything
that you want to tell me?

13:52.871 --> 13:54.171
About what?

13:54.206 --> 13:55.372
I don't know.

13:55.424 --> 13:56.707
I mean, I'm sure if
you think really hard,

13:56.759 --> 13:57.874
something will
come to mind.

13:57.926 --> 14:00.977
No, I-I don't think
I'm following.

14:01.013 --> 14:02.713
Uh, yeah, I'm
just thinking,

14:02.748 --> 14:05.048
anything about your
past, you know.

14:05.050 --> 14:06.216
Your "blackground."

14:06.268 --> 14:07.684
[both laugh]

14:07.720 --> 14:09.953
I mean, your biological parents,
they were...

14:09.988 --> 14:11.555
Wonderful people.

14:12.825 --> 14:14.791
- Marty, what are you getting at?
- [clears throat]

14:14.827 --> 14:16.360
Ah.

14:16.395 --> 14:17.828
You're not black, Devin.

14:17.863 --> 14:20.530
No, uh, I don't
understand the question.

14:20.566 --> 14:22.165
I didn't ask you a question.

14:22.201 --> 14:23.867
I made a statement.
You're not black.

14:23.902 --> 14:25.202
[chuckles]

14:25.237 --> 14:26.737
- Um...
- [chuckles] Devin,

14:26.789 --> 14:28.705
- I know. Devin, listen...
- [laughs] Wait...

14:28.741 --> 14:30.407
I already know, so...

14:30.409 --> 14:31.842
You're a phony.

14:31.877 --> 14:35.912
I mean, you're a sad clown
in a fucking business suit.

14:35.964 --> 14:38.081
Your-your whole waking life is
like a Kabuki show in blackface

14:38.133 --> 14:40.550
with the bronzer and
the head shaving.

14:40.586 --> 14:42.335
Look, we're-we're still
gonna make this money,

14:42.388 --> 14:43.587
but don't you want to

14:43.639 --> 14:45.255
drop the whole
act for a second,

14:45.257 --> 14:46.757
you know, all
the theatrics,

14:46.809 --> 14:48.558
and just be real?

14:51.096 --> 14:52.262
Hmm.

14:52.314 --> 14:53.930
[laughs]

14:55.934 --> 14:58.402
You know what's real, Marty?

14:58.437 --> 15:01.822
I applied to Wharton
three times as a white guy

15:01.857 --> 15:04.441
and was denied admission.

23:15.433 --> 23:16.866
I haven't.

23:19.437 --> 23:22.822
[groans] Oh...
I think we're being watched.

23:22.857 --> 23:23.873
Hey.

23:23.909 --> 23:25.191
Hey, Seth. What's up, man?
Do we have

23:25.243 --> 23:27.160
- a meeting on the books, or...?
- No, I actually

23:27.195 --> 23:29.212
just came by to bring coffee
for you and Jeannie,

23:29.247 --> 23:32.081
which I then
proceeded to drink.

23:32.117 --> 23:33.082
[laughs]

23:33.118 --> 23:35.001
Anyway, hate to break
this up, but Marty

23:35.036 --> 23:36.502
wants to see us
in his office, so...

23:36.538 --> 23:38.054
Yeah, I should probably
get going anyway.

23:38.089 --> 23:40.590
- I'll walk you out.
- I'll walk you out.

23:40.625 --> 23:42.959
- She can walk me out.
- Jeannie, yeah, yeah, of course.

23:43.011 --> 23:44.377
Dude, good
to see you.

23:44.429 --> 23:45.962

"speak now or forever

24:25.971 --> 24:28.004
because I had something
that I really want to add.

24:28.006 --> 24:29.272
What is it, Marty?

24:29.307 --> 24:30.890
Fire this cracker.

24:34.479 --> 24:36.512
That's a joke, right?

24:36.514 --> 24:37.563
No.

24:37.599 --> 24:39.515

24:50.195 --> 24:52.662
that you see?

24:54.282 --> 24:57.000
An attempt to force me
to answer a question

24:57.035 --> 24:58.634
I shouldn't have to.

24:59.537 --> 25:00.753
This-this is a high-tech
lynching.

25:00.789 --> 25:03.006

It feels kind of low-tech to me.

25:03.041 --> 25:04.207
That's just a JPEG,
Marty, right?

25:04.209 --> 25:05.208
Oh, yeah, that's just something

25:05.260 --> 25:06.542
we found and turned it
into a JPEG.

25:06.594 --> 25:08.811

you were smarter than this.

25:08.847 --> 25:11.597
[exhales] And I thought
you were black. Whoops.

25:11.633 --> 25:14.217
Marty, you knew about this,
and you still had me sign

25:14.219 --> 25:16.436
those documents...
it's un-fucking-believable.

25:16.471 --> 25:18.554
From an ethical standpoint,
you're absolutely correct.

25:18.556 --> 25:20.773
I'm sorry, Jean-Michal, we
should have told you earlier.

25:20.809 --> 25:24.694
- You're fired.
- You may want to rethink <i>that.</i>

25:24.729 --> 25:27.363
I mean, firing
the black consultant

25:27.399 --> 25:30.950

When I got
to Planet Curl,

25:49.888 --> 25:51.854
it was a garbage fire, okay?

25:51.890 --> 25:53.673

25:53.725 --> 25:56.059
the $100 million dollar mark

are totally amenable

[Jeannie] We're gonna stay
ahead of the narrative,

showing how you both discovered
there was a problem

26:07.939 --> 26:09.906
and then found
a solution.

26:09.941 --> 26:11.657
No, there's no other
fucking solution.
