00:01.990 --> 00:06.989
Previously on "Big Brother":
Austin's twins had made

00:06.990 --> 00:09.829
different alliances with
everyone in the house.

00:09.830 --> 00:10.989
Austin's angels.

00:10.990 --> 00:13.119
I love it!

00:13.120 --> 00:14.989
The scamper squad.

00:14.990 --> 00:17.989
We definitely want to work
with you.

00:17.990 --> 00:21.989
The deal we want to make with
you guys is we keep each other
safe.

00:21.990 --> 00:23.989
When Austin won head of
household...

00:23.990 --> 00:27.989
congratulations, you are the
new head of household!

00:27.990 --> 00:29.539
It was time to choose a side.

00:29.540 --> 00:32.289
It's time for me to make a
decision.

00:32.290 --> 00:35.989
Is Austin going to play this
game or is Judas?

00:35.990 --> 00:38.989
Is it time to betray somebody?

00:38.990 --> 00:43.829
Deciding to keep James and
Meg safe...

00:43.830 --> 00:45.989
when when Austin tells me I'm
safe I'm feeling real good about
it.

00:45.990 --> 00:48.989
Austin knew he only had three
possible targets.

00:48.990 --> 00:52.989
Either Vanessa, Steve, or
Johnny Mac.

00:52.990 --> 00:57.989
Knowing Johnny Mac would go
up, Austin wanted a pawn.

00:57.990 --> 00:59.989
The problem is the pawn has
to come from this room.

00:59.990 --> 01:01.989
It has to be you and me.

01:01.990 --> 01:03.989
And even though Steve
flat-out refused.

01:03.990 --> 01:06.289
I do not want to go up.

01:06.290 --> 01:06.990
Okay.

01:06.991 --> 01:10.989
.>> It wasn't enough to keep him
off block.

01:10.990 --> 01:14.989
Johnny Mac and Steve, you're
victims just like I am, but,

01:14.990 --> 01:16.989
unfortunately in life, victims
aren't we all.

01:16.990 --> 01:19.989
But Judas may still have a
backdoor plan up his sleeve.

01:19.990 --> 01:22.989
The backdoor option is still
open for Vanessa.

01:22.990 --> 01:26.989
Tonight, will the power of
veto save either Steve or Johnny

01:26.990 --> 01:26.991
Mac?

01:26.991 --> 01:29.989
Plus the roasting robot zingbot
is back.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.989
What's up, losers?

01:32.990 --> 01:37.989
All this right now on "big
brother."

01:37.990 --> 01:40.990
I like your butt.
>> I love your butt.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.700
This nomination ceremony is
adjourned.

02:25.540 --> 02:27.989
I put John and Steve on the
block this week because I feel

02:27.990 --> 02:30.989
like that is the least risk for
my game.

02:30.990 --> 02:34.119
I didn't put Vanessa up on the
block, but she's still on my
radar.

02:34.120 --> 02:38.989
If somebody comes down down with
a veto, she might have to be the
one who goes up.

02:38.990 --> 02:39.999
I'm not dumb, Austin.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.989
I can very easily be a target
for you this week.

02:42.990 --> 02:45.989
I don't feel safe.

02:45.990 --> 02:47.989
So Austin promised me that me
and Johnny Mac aren't going to

02:47.990 --> 02:51.989
be sitting on the block next to
each other, but right before the

02:51.990 --> 02:53.989
nomination ceremony I saw
Vanessa and Austin talking

02:53.990 --> 02:55.409
upstairs and heading down.

02:55.410 --> 02:58.989
I'm really frustrated Austin
went back on our alliance but I

02:58.990 --> 03:00.539
have to give Vanessa credit.

03:00.540 --> 03:03.989
I don't know how she's working
magic but as a super fan I have

03:03.990 --> 03:06.989
to appreciate her game play, and
she is good!

03:06.990 --> 03:07.990
How are you?

03:07.991 --> 03:09.409
I mean, I'm the target.

03:09.410 --> 03:09.990
I don't think so.

03:09.991 --> 03:11.409
You don't think so?

03:11.410 --> 03:17.989
No I mean, I was already lied
to, so who knows, but.

03:17.990 --> 03:20.989
I'm almost too much in awe of
her game play to be upset.

03:20.990 --> 03:23.999
Like, she is incredible!

03:24.000 --> 03:27.989
Did they tell you it would be
you and her up?

03:27.990 --> 03:33.989
I knew there were a certain
number of choices, and I knew we

03:33.990 --> 03:34.700
were one of them.

03:34.701 --> 03:36.989
Yup.

03:36.990 --> 03:37.990
They won't use it.

03:37.991 --> 03:42.539
You don't think so?

03:42.540 --> 03:43.989
Then let's win the veto.

03:43.990 --> 03:46.989
That is what we do best.

03:46.990 --> 03:48.989
Yeah.

03:48.990 --> 03:49.990
( Bleep ) Everyone.

03:49.991 --> 03:51.990
Yes.

03:56.990 --> 04:00.989
So it's no secret Austin and
the twins and I, our

04:00.990 --> 04:03.119
relationship right now isn't
exactly where it used to be.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.989
But not being nominated by
Austin was a great starting

04:05.990 --> 04:07.989
point for rebuilding this
relationship into what it used

04:07.990 --> 04:09.989
to be and what it can be.

04:09.990 --> 04:12.989
I'm really sorry that you were
in that position and all I can

04:12.990 --> 04:14.989
say is I'm very thankful.

04:14.990 --> 04:17.989
I'm telling you guys, I will not
cross you.

04:17.990 --> 04:18.990
I have good integrity.

04:18.990 --> 04:19.990
I do.

04:19.991 --> 04:24.999
It's not in my best interest
to let you go this week.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.989
I want to make things smooth
with Vanessa so I'm telling her

04:27.990 --> 04:28.990
what she wants to hear.

04:28.991 --> 04:30.539
I don't know what I'm going to
do this week.

04:30.540 --> 04:32.989
Right now every option is on the
table.

04:32.990 --> 04:37.119
I'm not going to decide who's
safe and who's not until I know

04:37.120 --> 04:38.989
what's going on the veto.

04:38.990 --> 04:41.989
I think Steve...
>> here he comes.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.989
Good.

04:43.990 --> 04:47.989
This is something Vanessa was
going to talk about publicly.

04:47.990 --> 04:51.989
If the noms somehow stay the
same, are you not going home,

04:51.990 --> 04:53.989
and this is in this room right
here.

04:53.990 --> 04:57.989
I'm sorry, I thought you just
said you wanted to say it

04:57.990 --> 05:00.989
publicly.

05:00.990 --> 05:01.990
Yeah.

05:01.990 --> 05:02.990
Like, in front of us.

05:02.991 --> 05:06.409
No...
>> oh, publicly for scamper.

05:06.410 --> 05:06.990
Nice.

05:06.991 --> 05:08.989
In this room, you have the votes
you're not going anywhere.

05:08.990 --> 05:10.989
I can ask who your target is?

05:10.990 --> 05:13.989
If it stays the same, Johnny
Mac goes.

05:13.990 --> 05:17.989
I'm sorry, but he's the last
minute we made an alliance with.

05:17.990 --> 05:21.119
I'm going to go and try to
get sleep for tomorrow's veto

05:21.120 --> 05:21.950
comp.

05:21.951 --> 05:23.989
If you want to pick me...
>> well, I'm definitely playing.

05:23.990 --> 05:31.989
Do whatever Austin wants.

05:31.990 --> 05:34.989
So you have no desire to send
her home this week?

05:34.990 --> 05:37.989
I mean, there are arguments
both ways for why she did what

05:37.990 --> 05:39.999
she did.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.989
If if you come off the block,
I'm going to have to put her up.

05:45.990 --> 05:53.990
It's going... oh, God, it's going
to be tough.

06:10.830 --> 06:11.830
Good night.

06:11.831 --> 06:19.831
Good night.

06:25.990 --> 06:28.409
What the ( Bleep ) Is that?

06:28.410 --> 06:28.990
What?

06:28.991 --> 06:30.989
I just heard, like, tapping.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.409
Is James in here?

06:32.410 --> 06:34.989
He's probably on the floor
next to you.

06:34.990 --> 06:42.990
No, he's not.

06:46.990 --> 06:47.990
I felt.

06:47.991 --> 06:51.829
He's not there.

06:51.830 --> 06:59.830
( Knocking ) >> What is that!

07:01.290 --> 07:03.989
( Knock ).

07:03.990 --> 07:04.990
Who's doing that?

07:04.990 --> 07:05.950
I don't know.

07:05.951 --> 07:06.989
I hate this room.

07:06.990 --> 07:11.989
It's haunted.

07:11.990 --> 07:12.990
( Knocking ).

07:12.991 --> 07:15.699
What the ( Bleep )!

07:15.700 --> 07:20.989
( Screaming )
Oh, my God, you got me!

07:20.990 --> 07:24.989
Bam, bam, bam, bam!

07:24.990 --> 07:32.699
( Laughter )
>> Hey, everybody, it's time to

07:32.700 --> 07:35.989
pick players for the veto
competition!

07:35.990 --> 07:35.991
Geez!

07:35.991 --> 07:41.989
Yes!

07:41.990 --> 07:44.989
Only six people will
participate in the veto

07:44.990 --> 07:46.989
competition, the head of
household of, the two nominees

07:46.990 --> 07:49.989
and three other players selected
by random draw.

07:49.990 --> 07:52.949
Will the nominees please join me
up here.

07:52.950 --> 07:56.989
It would be cool in feg and
Julia played today because

07:56.990 --> 08:01.949
they're weak competitors and
easy to beat but at the end of

08:01.950 --> 08:04.699
the day I have to win for
myself.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.699
Someone I trust needs to win
this veto.

08:06.700 --> 08:08.989
I cannot allow one of the
nominees to win and take

08:08.990 --> 08:09.990
themselves off the block.

08:09.991 --> 08:13.989
I need to have the power to keep
my options open and keep my

08:13.990 --> 08:17.539
targets wide open.

08:17.540 --> 08:18.540
Vanessa ( Applause )

08:18.541 --> 08:19.989
I always get picked.

08:19.990 --> 08:26.989
<i>( Applause )
</i>>> If it's anyone but Meg, I'm

08:26.990 --> 08:27.990
very disappointed.

08:27.991 --> 08:30.989
I'm hoping to draw Meg or Julia.

08:30.990 --> 08:32.989
They aren't very athletic.

08:32.990 --> 08:38.829
And they don't really have a
whole lot going on upstairs.

08:38.830 --> 08:41.989
Meg!

08:41.990 --> 08:42.990
Yes!

08:42.991 --> 08:44.989
That's right, Johnny Mac!

08:44.990 --> 08:50.409
I've never got picked.

08:50.410 --> 08:52.999
Julia.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.829
( Applause ) >> Yeah!

08:56.830 --> 08:57.989
I'm so happy.

08:57.990 --> 09:01.949
It's the first time your chip
was drawn.

09:01.950 --> 09:04.949
"Big Brother" will inform us
when the competition is to

09:04.950 --> 09:04.990
begin.

09:04.991 --> 09:05.990
Good luck.

09:05.991 --> 09:11.989
( Applause ) >> Voteo!

09:11.990 --> 09:18.289
Veto "n" veto!

09:18.290 --> 09:19.989
Yes, yes, yes.

09:19.990 --> 09:22.989
Vanessa and I have had a lot
of ups and downs in this game

09:22.990 --> 09:25.989
but I cannot forget the
connection we had early on in

09:25.990 --> 09:28.989
the game when we were super
tight and wanted to take each

09:28.990 --> 09:29.990
other to the end.

09:29.991 --> 09:33.989
I want to rebuild this
relationship with Vanessa.

09:33.990 --> 09:41.119
I was hoping you would get
picked.

09:41.120 --> 09:45.989
Well, the thing is we're kind
of, like, forced to do it.

09:45.990 --> 09:47.409
It's driving me nuts.

09:47.410 --> 09:49.989
Because where does Vanessa play
in all of that?

09:49.990 --> 09:52.989
We have to make a huge ( Bleep )
Decision.

09:52.990 --> 09:55.989
I think she's out of the loop.

09:55.990 --> 10:03.989
I think Steve and Johnny Mac
need to be separated.

10:03.990 --> 10:06.289
He can't win the veto.

10:06.290 --> 10:10.999
But Vanessa, still, she's done
so much.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.989
Until she was going to put us
up on the the block against each

10:15.990 --> 10:15.991
other.

10:15.991 --> 10:18.989
But that was a long time ago,
Austin.

10:18.990 --> 10:20.989
I'm just very much on to Steve
and Johnny Mac.

10:20.990 --> 10:21.990
I don't know.

10:21.991 --> 10:25.989
It's such a really... it's really
starting to weigh on me because

10:25.990 --> 10:27.289
it's a huge decision and will
change things.

10:27.290 --> 10:29.989
We already have Johnny Mac up
on the block, and I just think

10:29.990 --> 10:33.989
that Johnny Mac is a better
target because we don't know

10:33.990 --> 10:34.990
where his head is at.

10:34.991 --> 10:38.989
And the fact that Austin doesn't
even know who his target is, is

10:38.990 --> 10:40.409
really concerning.

10:40.410 --> 10:41.000
What's wrong?

10:41.001 --> 10:44.699
We're just going over, like,
scenarios.

10:44.700 --> 10:44.990
Yeah.

10:44.991 --> 10:46.989
So if I win, should I use it?

10:46.990 --> 10:49.989
Definitely try to win it.

10:49.990 --> 10:51.989
Things could get ugly.

10:51.990 --> 10:54.990
Things could get really ugly.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.829
I'm baaaack!

11:13.830 --> 11:18.989
What's up, losers?

11:18.990 --> 11:20.989
Miss me?

11:20.990 --> 11:25.989
I'm taking a cat nap, and
what do you know?

11:25.990 --> 11:26.990
Zingbot comes in.

11:26.991 --> 11:28.289
Oh, my God!

11:28.290 --> 11:33.999
He likes to roast on the
houseguests to get some stuff

11:34.000 --> 11:34.950
started.

11:34.951 --> 11:37.409
Whooo!

11:37.410 --> 11:38.989
Oh, my God.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.989
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:40.990 --> 11:41.990
Whoa.

11:41.991 --> 11:45.989
Hold on zingbot, I got you, boo.

11:45.990 --> 11:46.990
There you go, zingbot.

11:46.991 --> 11:49.989
I have some big news to share.

11:49.990 --> 11:53.989
I'm obsessed with you!

11:53.990 --> 11:59.539
I'm newly zingle, so I got an
upgrade.

11:59.540 --> 12:00.989
That's right, losers.

12:00.990 --> 12:06.989
You can now call me the zingbot
9000.

12:06.990 --> 12:10.989
Whooo!

12:10.990 --> 12:16.989
And I'm now on Twitter!

12:16.990 --> 12:17.990
( Applause ) James!

12:17.990 --> 12:18.990
Guess what?

12:18.990 --> 12:18.991
What?

12:18.991 --> 12:26.991
I heard Meg is going to take
you someplace very, very special

12:28.990 --> 12:36.989
after the show.

12:36.990 --> 12:41.989
Out of your league.

12:41.990 --> 12:41.991
Zing!

12:41.991 --> 12:44.119
You know what, zingbot?

12:44.120 --> 12:47.989
You're just mad because you're
not sleeping next to a beautiful

12:47.990 --> 12:49.989
woman, even though it's five
feet apart.

12:49.990 --> 12:51.989
But that doesn't even matter.

12:51.990 --> 12:58.989
Go zing yourself.

12:58.990 --> 13:06.119
L Liz, I'm confused.

13:06.120 --> 13:13.989
Suddenly you're less attractive,
less intelligent, and less

13:13.990 --> 13:14.700
charming.

13:14.701 --> 13:17.949
Oh, wait.

13:17.950 --> 13:22.289
That's just Julia.

13:22.290 --> 13:22.990
Zing!

13:22.990 --> 13:22.991
( Applause ).

13:22.991 --> 13:25.989
Zingbot, for your
information, we got the same

13:25.990 --> 13:28.989
s.A.T. Scores, so how about
that?

13:28.990 --> 13:30.989
Zing.

13:30.990 --> 13:34.989
Steve!

13:34.990 --> 13:40.289
What's less cool than a
trombonist who cries for his

13:40.290 --> 13:40.990
mommy?

13:40.990 --> 13:41.990
What?

13:41.991 --> 13:46.119
Nothing!

13:46.120 --> 13:46.950
Zing!

13:46.951 --> 13:47.989
I love you, mommy.

13:47.990 --> 13:52.989
Yeah, zingbot, I'm a nerd
trombonist who likes my mom and

13:52.990 --> 13:53.990
I'm a nice guy.

13:53.991 --> 13:56.989
Maybe if you tried being nice to
a girl every once in a while,

13:56.990 --> 13:57.990
you wouldn't be single.

13:57.990 --> 13:58.990
Ever consider that?

13:58.991 --> 14:03.989
Will someone please take out
the trash.

14:03.990 --> 14:06.989
It stinks in here.

14:06.990 --> 14:08.829
It actually does not.

14:08.830 --> 14:13.989
Oh, wait, that's just Austin!

14:13.990 --> 14:16.989
Where is this body odor
coming from?

14:16.990 --> 14:17.950
Zing!

14:17.951 --> 14:18.989
Why?

14:18.990 --> 14:22.539
It's not me, I promise!

14:22.540 --> 14:24.989
Meg!

14:24.990 --> 14:30.949
Your New York attitude is very
"sex and the city."

14:30.950 --> 14:38.950
Too bad your game play is more
"sucks in the city."

14:39.990 --> 14:43.989
Zing!

14:43.990 --> 14:43.991
John!

14:43.991 --> 14:44.990
Bring it!

14:44.991 --> 14:52.991
Five out of five dentists
agree... the only thing less

14:53.990 --> 15:01.990
attractive than your laugh is
your back hair!

15:03.990 --> 15:04.990
Zing!

15:04.991 --> 15:06.989
What's the matter, zingbot?

15:06.990 --> 15:10.989
You afraid of this here?

15:10.990 --> 15:10.991
Huh?

15:10.991 --> 15:11.990
You jealous?

15:11.991 --> 15:14.989
You can't grow any yourself can
you, because you're a piece of

15:14.990 --> 15:15.540
metal.

15:15.541 --> 15:17.989
No one likes you, and you're
stupid.

15:17.990 --> 15:19.989
It's getting ugly in here.

15:19.990 --> 15:21.539
Vanessa!

15:21.540 --> 15:26.989
You have been playing a
masterful game.

15:26.990 --> 15:28.699
Ooooh.

15:28.700 --> 15:36.700
Assuming that game is the
crying game.

15:37.990 --> 15:39.989
They better get Liz.

15:39.990 --> 15:39.991
They got me.

15:39.991 --> 15:41.989
It was a zing for me.

15:41.990 --> 15:42.990
Get her!

15:42.991 --> 15:44.539
Yeah.

15:44.540 --> 15:48.289
Liz!

15:48.290 --> 15:55.989
You've become such an important
part of Austin's life.

15:55.990 --> 16:03.990
Are you more excited to meet his
mom, his dad, or his girlfriend?

16:09.830 --> 16:13.119
Zing!

16:13.120 --> 16:17.999
That's ( Bleep ).

16:18.000 --> 16:18.990
Really?

16:18.991 --> 16:21.999
Oh!

16:22.000 --> 16:23.989
Oh, my God.

16:23.990 --> 16:28.989
That freaking zingbot, man.

16:28.990 --> 16:29.990
That was amazing.

16:29.990 --> 16:30.990
We love you.

16:30.990 --> 16:31.990
Whooo.

16:31.991 --> 16:37.989
It's time for the veto
competition!

16:37.990 --> 16:40.989
Yeah!

16:40.990 --> 16:44.989
We love you, zingbot!

16:44.990 --> 16:49.539
( Sighs )
Obviously, I knew he had a

16:49.540 --> 16:49.990
girlfriend.

16:49.990 --> 16:50.700
How do I feel.

16:50.700 --> 16:50.990
It?

16:50.990 --> 16:51.990
It's not my problem.

16:51.991 --> 16:53.989
I'm single.

16:53.990 --> 16:56.989
You've been going out with her,
like, two years?

16:56.990 --> 16:58.989
18 months, yeah.

16:58.990 --> 17:01.989
Obviously, you were pretty
serious.

17:01.990 --> 17:03.989
That was when I was trying to
chase her, still.

17:03.990 --> 17:05.989
That's so unattractive.

17:05.990 --> 17:10.989
Are you serious right now?

17:10.990 --> 17:12.989
This zing could not have come at
a worst time.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.989
I'm trying to get ready for a
huge veto competition that I

17:15.990 --> 17:16.990
need to win.

17:16.991 --> 17:20.829
This is a huge distraction, and
it's literally the last thing I
need right now.

17:20.830 --> 17:25.830
You stink, and I am hooking
up with a guy that has a
girlfriend, whatever.

17:38.990 --> 17:44.989
Yes!

17:44.990 --> 17:46.989
This is a huge veto competition.

17:46.990 --> 17:48.989
I don't want Steve or Johnny Mac
to win.

17:48.990 --> 17:51.989
If they do, they can pull
themselves down and possibly me

17:51.990 --> 17:53.989
and Meg will be a replacement
nominee.

17:53.990 --> 17:54.830
We are ready!

17:54.830 --> 17:55.290
Oh, yeah.

17:55.291 --> 18:01.990
Oh, yeah.

18:03.990 --> 18:11.990
I walk outside, and I am
digin zingbot's bachelor pad.

18:12.990 --> 18:15.989
I'm finally playing in a veto
competition and I need to win

18:15.990 --> 18:16.410
it.

18:16.411 --> 18:18.989
It is essential to keep the
power between me, Liz, and

18:18.990 --> 18:18.991
Austin.

18:18.991 --> 18:23.829
So we can pretty much make any
decision we want this week.

18:23.830 --> 18:27.949
Being newly zingel, zingbot has
been spending a lot of time on

18:27.950 --> 18:29.999
zinder looking for a new
companion.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.989
On go, hit the button to start
your time.

18:32.990 --> 18:37.989
The zinder app will open and
it's your job to tell zingbot

18:37.990 --> 18:42.949
which houseguest each of his
potential lovers resembles.

18:42.950 --> 18:45.989
When you think you know the
three houseguests, light up the

18:45.990 --> 18:49.989
names on your answer board and
run over and hit your button.

18:49.990 --> 18:52.989
If the name is correct, the app
will reopen.

18:52.990 --> 18:54.989
If incorrect, a buzzer will
sound, the clock will keep

18:54.990 --> 18:58.989
running and you must figure out
what is wrong and change your
answer.

18:58.990 --> 19:02.989
The houseguest who correctly
identifies the faces in the

19:02.990 --> 19:05.989
shortest amount of time will win
the power of veto.

19:05.990 --> 19:10.989
Are you ready to play newly
zingel?

19:10.990 --> 19:16.989
( Bell ) Oh, my God.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.989
Whose eyes are... okay.

19:19.990 --> 19:21.989
Wow, this first one is stunning.

19:21.990 --> 19:22.990
That makes sense.

19:22.991 --> 19:30.539
Those are my eyes.

19:30.540 --> 19:37.989
( Bell )
>> She got that first one so

19:37.990 --> 19:37.991
quick.

19:37.991 --> 19:39.989
Vanessa.

19:39.990 --> 19:46.949
( Bell )
>> The third face comes on the

19:46.950 --> 19:46.990
screen.

19:46.991 --> 19:48.949
I've got this one in the bag.

19:48.950 --> 19:53.989
I know it's John's eyes and
Shelli's mouth.

19:53.990 --> 19:54.990
Whose nose is that?

19:54.991 --> 19:58.539
Maybe it's Jace's?

19:58.540 --> 19:58.990
Jace.

19:58.990 --> 19:59.990
( Buzzer ).

19:59.991 --> 20:04.829
I cannot think whose nose
this is.

20:04.830 --> 20:08.989
( Buzzer ) ( Buzzer )

20:08.990 --> 20:09.990
It's not Jace.

20:09.991 --> 20:11.989
It's not Jeff.

20:11.990 --> 20:13.989
Oh, great, whose nose is that.

20:13.990 --> 20:15.989
I literally choose every guy on
the board.

20:15.990 --> 20:19.989
It doesn't even come across my
mind that it could go a freaking

20:19.990 --> 20:19.991
girl.

20:19.991 --> 20:23.989
Who's is this?

20:23.990 --> 20:23.991
Meg.

20:23.991 --> 20:25.989
( Bell ) Oh!

20:25.990 --> 20:29.699
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

20:29.700 --> 20:29.990
Okay.

20:29.991 --> 20:36.989
This is my favorite beside mine,
of course.

20:36.990 --> 20:41.289
James' eyes, Becky's mouth.

20:41.290 --> 20:43.989
I know this one for sure.

20:43.990 --> 20:44.990
Yeah!

20:44.990 --> 20:44.991
Austin!

20:44.991 --> 20:45.990
Oh, that's scary.

20:45.991 --> 20:48.699
That glare has to be Austin.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.989
I recognize Liz's nose from a
mile away.

20:50.990 --> 20:51.990
Who's mouth is that?

20:51.990 --> 20:52.990
Perfect teeth.

20:52.991 --> 20:54.989
It's Jace!

20:54.990 --> 20:56.989
( Bell ) Yeah!

20:56.990 --> 21:00.989
Oh, yeah!

21:00.990 --> 21:04.989
Oh, bushy eyebrows.

21:04.990 --> 21:08.989
Clay and whose nose is that?

21:08.990 --> 21:09.990
Audrey's.

21:09.991 --> 21:14.999
( Bell ) Yeah!

21:15.000 --> 21:15.990
Oh, yeah.

21:15.990 --> 21:16.120
Oh, yeah.

21:16.121 --> 21:17.289
I'm happy with that.

21:17.290 --> 21:19.989
I'll take that.

21:19.990 --> 21:20.990
Yay!

21:20.991 --> 21:22.989
I did so good!

21:22.990 --> 21:25.989
Freaking Meg, I hate her.

21:25.990 --> 21:27.409
4:45.

21:27.410 --> 21:27.990
Wow.

21:27.990 --> 21:28.990
I'll do my best.

21:28.991 --> 21:33.989
Four minute and 45 seconds
actually makes me feel pretty
good.

21:33.990 --> 21:37.989
I can get maybe two to three
guesses per face and still win
this thing.

21:37.990 --> 21:41.949
I'm being told I'm safe this
week, but who knows what's going
on.

21:41.950 --> 21:44.989
I'd rather not risk it and just
get the guarantee.

21:44.990 --> 21:47.699
That's definitely Jackie's
smile.

21:47.700 --> 21:48.989
Whose eyes are those?

21:48.990 --> 21:50.989
I think those are Julia's.

21:50.990 --> 21:54.989
I'm more in favor of slow and
steady.

21:54.990 --> 21:55.990
Is that Jeff's nose.

21:55.990 --> 21:56.990
It's Julia.

21:56.991 --> 21:58.289
Nope, he's wrong.

21:58.290 --> 21:59.539
Wrong again.

21:59.540 --> 22:04.989
( Buzzer ) ( Bell )

22:04.990 --> 22:08.989
Looking at the second face I
can pick out Audrey pretty easy.

22:08.990 --> 22:12.989
Vanessa has a Noel next to her
nose.

22:12.990 --> 22:20.990
Thanks, Vanessa ( Bell )

22:22.290 --> 22:23.290
Is that me?

22:23.291 --> 22:25.989
( Buzzer ) >> You're done.

22:25.990 --> 22:26.990
You're done.

22:26.991 --> 22:29.119
You're done!

22:29.120 --> 22:36.989
( Bell )
>> So I'm looking at the

22:36.990 --> 22:41.989
face and I can figure out James'
eyes.

22:41.990 --> 22:42.990
The problem is the mouth.

22:42.991 --> 22:45.989
I'm guessing and I'm guessing
and I can't figure it out.

22:45.990 --> 22:53.989
( Buzzer ).

22:53.990 --> 22:55.989
It's freaking Becky!

22:55.990 --> 23:02.409
Will you please leave me alone!

23:02.410 --> 23:02.990
Jace.

23:02.991 --> 23:05.989
Let's try me.

23:05.990 --> 23:05.991
Austin.

23:05.991 --> 23:10.829
( Buzzer )
>> 45 seconds, come on.

23:10.830 --> 23:11.989
Who's the nose.

23:11.990 --> 23:13.989
Oh, Liz.

23:13.990 --> 23:19.949
( Bell )
That's definitely my tooth.

23:19.950 --> 23:24.989
Who's nose is that?

23:24.990 --> 23:28.989
Could it be Clay's?

23:28.990 --> 23:31.989
Who have I not used yet?

23:31.990 --> 23:33.699
Just try something.

23:33.700 --> 23:34.989
( Buzzer ) Am I out.

23:34.990 --> 23:36.989
That's it!

23:36.990 --> 23:37.990
Whooo!

23:37.991 --> 23:40.989
Get out of here!

23:40.990 --> 23:43.989
Stay on that block!

23:43.990 --> 23:46.989
It's frustrate they go didn't
win the veto and I can't pull

23:46.990 --> 23:50.539
myself off the block this week,
but at the same time, Austin is

23:50.540 --> 23:51.989
assuring me I am a pawn.

23:51.990 --> 23:53.289
I should be okay this week.

23:53.290 --> 23:57.989
I just hope everyone sticks to
their word.

23:57.990 --> 23:58.290
Steve!

23:58.291 --> 24:00.539
Pull up a chair.

24:00.540 --> 24:06.989
( Bell )
>> I'm not the best at details.

24:06.990 --> 24:08.989
It took me a couple of weeks to
figure out Liz and Julia were
two different people.

24:08.990 --> 24:12.949
I have to win the power of veto
this week so I can either keep

24:12.950 --> 24:15.989
the nominations the same or
backdoor Vanessa.

24:15.990 --> 24:18.989
Right now, every option is on
the table.

24:18.990 --> 24:22.989
( Bell ) Eyebrows.

24:22.990 --> 24:29.989
( Bell ) What is that?

24:29.990 --> 24:31.119
Oh, my God!

24:31.120 --> 24:36.989
Zingbot, these are the types of
fefbotts you're interested in.

24:36.990 --> 24:38.989
It's not me.

24:38.990 --> 24:41.989
I'm so pissed, he doesn't even
know mow.

24:41.990 --> 24:46.989
( Buzzer )
>> The third fem bot is up and I

24:46.990 --> 24:51.539
can't figure out whose nose am I
looking at?

24:51.540 --> 24:53.409
Where have I seen it perfect?

24:53.410 --> 24:54.989
What the hell?

24:54.990 --> 24:56.989
No, it's not me!

24:56.990 --> 24:58.539
( Buzzer ).

24:58.540 --> 25:04.989
Austin, you suck.

25:04.990 --> 25:06.539
( Buzzer ).

25:06.540 --> 25:06.990
There goes that.

25:06.991 --> 25:08.699
Take the walk of shame.

25:08.700 --> 25:10.989
We hate you!

25:10.990 --> 25:11.950
We hate you!

25:11.951 --> 25:14.989
You suck!

25:14.990 --> 25:16.989
You didn't even know me!

25:16.990 --> 25:17.990
I couldn't see it.

25:17.990 --> 25:18.990
It wasn't me!

25:18.991 --> 25:21.989
I know it wasn't but I
thought it was a girl.

25:21.990 --> 25:22.990
It was so hard.

25:22.991 --> 25:26.989
I don't win the veto but I'm
extremely relieved to see Julia

25:26.990 --> 25:28.699
has it around her neck.

25:28.700 --> 25:28.990
This is huge.

25:28.991 --> 25:31.989
And now all we need to do is
make it through a few more

25:31.990 --> 25:34.699
rounds and we're home free.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.989
I kept see you pressing Liz.

25:36.990 --> 25:38.989
I just wanted to press your
name.

25:38.990 --> 25:41.989
Time to beat, four minutes
and 45 seconds.

25:41.990 --> 25:43.989
Oh, my goodness.

25:43.990 --> 25:43.991
Okay.

25:43.991 --> 25:46.989
I'm actually feeling like I
could go up as a backdoor target

25:46.990 --> 25:48.989
and potentially go home this
week.

25:48.990 --> 25:51.989
I need to wen this competition
and ensure my safety.

25:51.990 --> 25:54.989
She's got the little wrist
bands.

25:54.990 --> 25:56.989
I've got this.

25:56.990 --> 26:01.699
So I look up at the first
picture, and immediately I

26:01.700 --> 26:05.989
notice it's Julia's eyes, Jeff's
nose, I look at the lips, and

26:05.990 --> 26:10.989
this one has got to be Jackie.

26:10.990 --> 26:15.989
Zingbot, your taste in fembots
is no bueno.

26:15.990 --> 26:19.989
I think you need to let me get
you some more options.

26:19.990 --> 26:22.989
She's on fire!

26:22.990 --> 26:23.990
Your eyes, James?

26:23.991 --> 26:31.991
Yeah, those are my eyes. You
can't tell?

26:33.990 --> 26:35.989
( Buzzer ).

26:35.990 --> 26:38.989
Those eyes, I'm not 100% sure
on this one.

26:38.990 --> 26:39.700
Nope!

26:39.701 --> 26:40.989
It's Clay.

26:40.990 --> 26:41.990
It's Clay.

26:41.991 --> 26:45.699
Clay.

26:45.700 --> 26:49.989
( Bell ) >> She crushed it.

26:49.990 --> 26:49.991
Yeah.

26:49.991 --> 26:55.989
I look at my time and it's 2:51
which means I'm the new time to

26:55.990 --> 26:55.991
beat.

26:55.991 --> 27:00.989
I know there are two more people
to go before I lock in the pov,

27:00.990 --> 27:02.539
but so far, so good.

27:02.540 --> 27:02.990
Awesome.

27:02.990 --> 27:03.990
Thank you!

27:03.990 --> 27:04.990
All right!

27:04.991 --> 27:09.949
Let's do this!

27:09.950 --> 27:14.989
2:51, okay.

27:14.990 --> 27:17.989
It's very important for me to
win this veto because in the

27:17.990 --> 27:20.989
back of my mind I feel like I've
been lied to all week.

27:20.990 --> 27:21.990
I could be the target.

27:21.990 --> 27:22.990
I'm not sure.

27:22.991 --> 27:24.989
( Buzzer )
And the only way to make sure

27:24.990 --> 27:28.829
they stay for this week is to
win this veto.

27:28.830 --> 27:29.290
No!

27:29.291 --> 27:30.989
That's not it!

27:30.990 --> 27:32.989
Time is ticking.

27:32.990 --> 27:36.989
I know that I have most of
the house watching me upstairs

27:36.990 --> 27:41.989
completely mess this thing up,
and I just feel like an idiot.

27:41.990 --> 27:42.990
You're done.

27:42.991 --> 27:44.989
You're done!

27:44.990 --> 27:48.289
( Buzzer ).

27:48.290 --> 27:56.290
( Bell ) ( Buzzer ).

28:02.540 --> 28:10.540
( Buzzer )
>> Cut to a commercial break.

28:16.990 --> 28:17.990
John!

28:17.990 --> 28:17.991
Yeah!

28:17.991 --> 28:20.829
Vanessa won.

28:20.830 --> 28:20.990
Whooo!

28:20.991 --> 28:22.989
I just feel crushed right now.

28:22.990 --> 28:25.989
Vanessa is the one person I
don't want to see win the veto.

28:25.990 --> 28:29.989
I feel like I'm dead now unless
my worst enemy somehow wants to

28:29.990 --> 28:31.539
use the veto on me.

28:31.540 --> 28:36.989
Oh, God, there's popcorn in
my freaking pants.

28:36.990 --> 28:40.989
I want to win this veto
competition because it ensures

28:40.990 --> 28:44.989
that there is no chance of a
backdoor for James or myself.

28:44.990 --> 28:49.989
And I want to prove zingbot
wrong that my game doesn't suck.

28:49.990 --> 28:54.989
Zingbot, the only thing that
sucks around here is your love

28:54.990 --> 28:55.990
life.

28:55.991 --> 28:58.989
Zing!

28:58.990 --> 29:00.999
I put together this face
immediately, and I'm feeling

29:01.000 --> 29:09.000
good.

29:10.120 --> 29:11.949
Audrey.

29:18.540 --> 29:20.289
Who is it?

29:20.290 --> 29:21.989
She didn't guess herself!

29:21.990 --> 29:22.990
Oh, my God!

29:22.991 --> 29:26.989
No, that's a boy nose.

29:26.990 --> 29:30.989
I cannot figure out whose nose
this is.

29:30.990 --> 29:32.949
It's your nose!

29:32.950 --> 29:36.829
( Buzzer ) Garbage!

29:36.830 --> 29:40.989
Garbage!

29:40.990 --> 29:42.289
( Bell ).

29:42.290 --> 29:43.699
Ahhh!

29:43.700 --> 29:46.999
I knew it!

29:47.000 --> 29:47.990
Aarrghhh!

29:47.990 --> 29:48.990
Yes!

29:48.990 --> 29:48.991
Uh-huh.

29:48.991 --> 29:49.990
It's my birthday.

29:49.990 --> 29:50.990
It's my birthday.

29:50.990 --> 29:51.700
Oh, yeah.

29:51.701 --> 29:55.989
Another one of these.

29:55.990 --> 29:58.989
I'm feeling super blessed to be
able to win when I needed to.

29:58.990 --> 29:59.950
It feels good.

29:59.951 --> 30:05.829
I can finally get some sleep
around here.

30:05.830 --> 30:07.989
Meg!

30:07.990 --> 30:07.991
Oh!

30:07.991 --> 30:08.990
What was that!

30:08.991 --> 30:10.409
I'm in trouble.

30:10.410 --> 30:15.989
I'm just going to stay out of it
for a while and think what I can

30:15.990 --> 30:17.989
do to try to regroup from here.

30:17.990 --> 30:20.989
Where there's a will there's a
way, hopefully.

30:20.990 --> 30:23.989
But right now it looks like
Johnny Mac is going to jury.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.989
I knew everyone's except myself.

30:25.990 --> 30:29.989
Vanessa has won the power of
veto so there's no backdoing her
this week.

30:29.990 --> 30:33.289
Now I just have to hope I can
work with her and she doesn't

30:33.290 --> 30:37.290
decide to make her own decision
with this veto and force me to
do something I don't want to do.

31:09.990 --> 31:11.999
Hi.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.289
Cant sleep.

31:13.290 --> 31:15.989
What's happening?

31:15.990 --> 31:18.989
Eating popcorn for breakfast?

31:18.990 --> 31:18.991
You?

31:18.991 --> 31:23.949
I'm eating cereal.

31:23.950 --> 31:27.989
So I have a really important
question to ask you.

31:27.990 --> 31:31.989
Are you over the thing with
Becky?

31:31.990 --> 31:32.990
I'm over it.

31:32.991 --> 31:35.989
Are you over the thing with
Clay?

31:35.990 --> 31:36.990
I'm over it, Vanessa.

31:36.991 --> 31:38.119
I'm alone in this game.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.989
They're gone.

31:39.990 --> 31:41.989
Right.

31:41.990 --> 31:46.539
Vanessa, I've lost friend
after friend after friend.

31:46.540 --> 31:49.409
And I feel like everyone wants
to keep Steve.

31:49.410 --> 31:50.989
I'm probably going home.

31:50.990 --> 31:52.989
I'm alone.

31:52.990 --> 31:53.830
At this point.

31:53.830 --> 31:53.990
That's how I feel.

31:53.991 --> 31:55.989
Right.

31:55.990 --> 31:57.989
No, I completely understand the
feeg.

31:57.990 --> 31:59.989
I've been alone for a long time
in this game.

31:59.990 --> 32:00.990
It's not fun.

32:00.991 --> 32:06.989
I'm telling you, you and I
might feel like the biggest

32:06.990 --> 32:10.949
enemies in the house, but...
>> I just want you to know

32:10.950 --> 32:13.989
you've never been my enemy and
that's the truth.

32:13.990 --> 32:14.990
You really haven't.

32:14.991 --> 32:16.989
I just think it's so stupid for
us...

32:16.990 --> 32:18.949
to keep going at each other?

32:18.950 --> 32:22.119
Yes, yes, and to let... and to
let everyone else in the house

32:22.120 --> 32:24.989
keep building their numbers and
meanwhile we're just swindling

32:24.990 --> 32:27.989
down in the middle.

32:27.990 --> 32:29.989
I'm dead in the water at this
point.

32:29.990 --> 32:33.539
I could use just about anyone
right now and sometimes you've

32:33.540 --> 32:37.289
just got to make a deal with the
devil you know is not going to

32:37.290 --> 32:38.989
be trustworthy.

32:38.990 --> 32:40.989
If we want to work going
forward, I'm down.

32:40.990 --> 32:44.699
Because I have nowhere to go in
this game.

32:44.700 --> 32:46.989
If you want to work together...
>> I do.

32:46.990 --> 32:47.990
I have no one.

32:47.991 --> 32:49.409
I do.

32:49.410 --> 32:52.119
I don't want you to go.

32:52.120 --> 32:56.989
I think there's something we can
do about it, and I've just got

32:56.990 --> 33:00.989
to see where Austin's head's at
this morning.

33:00.990 --> 33:02.989
I'd love to use the veto.

33:02.990 --> 33:03.950
That would be awesome.

33:03.951 --> 33:05.989
And assuming I can get Austin
and them on board.

33:05.990 --> 33:09.699
Because if he'd be pissed at me
for using it and would have to

33:09.700 --> 33:11.989
do something, that would be bad.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.989
But as long as I have your word
that we are cool, though.

33:14.990 --> 33:14.991
Yeah.

33:14.991 --> 33:19.989
Okay, okay.

33:19.990 --> 33:21.989
How you doing?

33:21.990 --> 33:22.990
Good.

33:22.991 --> 33:25.989
Now they have the power of
veto, it's important Austin and

33:25.990 --> 33:27.989
I discuss all potential options.

33:27.990 --> 33:34.119
Let me tell you, bro, his
back is against the wall.

33:34.120 --> 33:41.289
I think we're dumb asses if we
keep him over Meg and James when

33:41.290 --> 33:45.829
we can have Johnny Mac in our
back pocket.

33:45.830 --> 33:49.989
If you use it, I have to put
one of them.

33:49.990 --> 33:50.990
They don't know where you stand.

33:50.991 --> 33:54.829
They're probably pretty nervous
about what you'll doing.

33:54.830 --> 34:00.989
You know what my instinct is
going forward, targeting Meg.

34:00.990 --> 34:04.989
The thing is James feels for
Meg like I feel for Liz.

34:04.990 --> 34:08.949
Then he's a dumb ( Bleep )
Because she doesn't like him.

34:08.950 --> 34:11.989
I know, but I know how he feels.

34:11.990 --> 34:15.989
He will be nuts and irrational,
and if Jackie comes back,

34:15.990 --> 34:17.989
they're... boom.

34:17.990 --> 34:20.989
James and Jackie together and
scary.

34:20.990 --> 34:22.989
Vanessa, this is just a selfish
move, using the veto and having

34:22.990 --> 34:25.989
to put up Meg or James is a
disaster.

34:25.990 --> 34:27.119
I'm finally working close with
them.

34:27.120 --> 34:30.119
If we do this now and one of
them goes home and maybe comes

34:30.120 --> 34:34.989
back from the jury, they're
coming after me and the twins

34:34.990 --> 34:35.990
and everything falls apart.

34:35.991 --> 34:38.989
This is a... this is a big-time
scenario.

34:38.990 --> 34:42.989
If you use the veto, I really
have to... I really ( Bleep ).

34:42.990 --> 34:44.989
I didn't want to go after Meg
and James this week.

34:44.990 --> 34:52.990
I mean, if you don't want to,
we don't have to.

34:59.990 --> 35:00.990
Thanks.

35:00.990 --> 35:01.700
I like it.

35:01.701 --> 35:04.949
Although my conversation went
well with Johnny Mac, I sort of

35:04.950 --> 35:08.989
feel like my hands are tied at
this point.

35:08.990 --> 35:10.989
He doesn't want to use it?

35:10.990 --> 35:12.829
No.

35:12.830 --> 35:20.830
If I use it, he and the twins
will come after me.

35:21.540 --> 35:22.540
So...
>> I hear you.

35:22.541 --> 35:23.989
I hope you understand.

35:23.990 --> 35:23.991
I tried.

35:23.991 --> 35:24.990
Yeah.

35:24.991 --> 35:32.991
You're at the bottom, whether
I go or not.

35:33.990 --> 35:39.949
They told me we had a
five-person alliance to get you

35:39.950 --> 35:39.988
out.

35:39.989 --> 35:40.540
Me?

35:40.541 --> 35:41.989
Last week, yeah.

35:41.990 --> 35:41.991
Oh, really?

35:41.991 --> 35:45.989
I thought you knew about this
already.

35:45.990 --> 35:49.989
Austin, the twins, and you
and Steve?

35:49.990 --> 35:52.989
Yeah.

35:52.990 --> 35:57.989
My back's up against the wall,
and it's not looking good.

35:57.990 --> 36:02.989
I'm trying anything I can to get
the veto used on me.

36:02.990 --> 36:03.990
Yeah.

36:03.991 --> 36:07.989
Like, I was looking for an
alliance at the time.

36:07.990 --> 36:09.989
And I was after you.

36:09.990 --> 36:12.989
I just wanted to tell you
that we definitely top work with

36:12.990 --> 36:15.539
you.

36:15.540 --> 36:17.949
It's just Vanessa, it's
apparent, that she's willing to

36:17.950 --> 36:19.989
do anything to win this game.

36:19.990 --> 36:22.989
Just got to think strategically
about when we want to take her

36:22.990 --> 36:23.540
out.

36:23.541 --> 36:26.989
I just don't understand,
though, why they did that,

36:26.990 --> 36:33.989
though, why they flipped the
script on me.

36:33.990 --> 36:37.949
Hey, Johnny said last week
there was a five-person alliance

36:37.950 --> 36:38.989
to get me out.

36:38.990 --> 36:41.119
Steve, you, him, your sister,
and Austin.

36:41.120 --> 36:41.990
Is that true?

36:41.990 --> 36:42.990
No.

36:42.990 --> 36:43.990
That's just a complete lie.

36:43.991 --> 36:46.989
I don't know why he's saying
that.

36:46.990 --> 36:48.989
That's totally a lie.

36:48.990 --> 36:51.989
( Sighs )
I get there was a target.

36:51.990 --> 36:54.949
But was there a five-person
alliance to get me out?

36:54.950 --> 36:55.989
What is he trying to do here?

36:55.990 --> 36:56.990
I don't know.

36:56.990 --> 36:57.990
I'm just trying to understand.

36:57.991 --> 36:59.989
I mean, okay, yeah.

36:59.990 --> 37:03.829
It was Steve's idea.

37:03.830 --> 37:07.829
He wanted to bring Johnny Mac
into it.

37:07.830 --> 37:10.989
And since Johnny Mac was
targeting you, he was like let's

37:10.990 --> 37:12.699
just bring us five in it.

37:12.700 --> 37:15.989
So it was Johnny Mac and win.

37:15.990 --> 37:17.699
So it was Steve's idea?

37:17.700 --> 37:18.989
It was Steve's idea, yeah.

37:18.990 --> 37:19.290
Really?

37:19.291 --> 37:21.699
He orchestrated it.

37:21.700 --> 37:22.290
Interesting.

37:22.291 --> 37:25.989
Do you think we really wanted
to?

37:25.990 --> 37:27.989
Why did Steve want to do that?

37:27.990 --> 37:29.949
How would that benefit Steve?

37:29.950 --> 37:30.989
Him and Johnny Mac are close.

37:30.990 --> 37:36.989
They're working together.

37:36.990 --> 37:38.989
Steve's a guy that I was
really looking out for in the

37:38.990 --> 37:41.989
game and we've had a lot of
really personal conversations.

37:41.990 --> 37:42.990
Your hair looks good.

37:42.990 --> 37:43.990
Thank you!

37:43.990 --> 37:44.990
Vanessa did it!

37:44.991 --> 37:48.989
I just realize how fake a lot
of it was.

37:48.990 --> 37:56.989
And that he took me for a fool.

37:56.990 --> 37:57.990
That's annoying.

37:57.991 --> 38:00.289
Are you okay?

38:00.290 --> 38:01.989
I'm great, Steve.

38:01.990 --> 38:02.990
I'm really ( Bleep ) Great.

38:02.991 --> 38:04.989
Thanks for asking.

38:04.990 --> 38:05.990
Suddenly so concerned, aren't
you?

38:05.990 --> 38:06.990
Should I leave you alone?

38:06.991 --> 38:08.989
Probably that's a good idea.

38:08.990 --> 38:09.990
Okay.

38:09.991 --> 38:12.990
I'll do that.

38:22.990 --> 38:24.829
Steve, Steve, could I talk to
you?

38:24.830 --> 38:29.989
Sure.

38:29.990 --> 38:33.989
So Johnny said there was a
five-person alliance, you,

38:33.990 --> 38:36.989
Johnny, the twins and Austin to
get rid of me.

38:36.990 --> 38:37.990
True or false?

38:37.991 --> 38:40.989
That was something discussed,
true?

38:40.990 --> 38:42.989
Whose idea was it.

38:42.990 --> 38:44.989
Who orchestrated it?

38:44.990 --> 38:45.950
Not me.

38:45.951 --> 38:48.989
They told me it was you.

38:48.990 --> 38:51.829
It's confirmed it was you,
right.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.289
If it was, you don't have my
vote.

38:53.290 --> 38:53.990
It was you?

38:53.990 --> 38:54.000
No.

38:54.001 --> 38:55.989
Was it you?

38:55.990 --> 38:55.991
No.

38:55.991 --> 38:58.989
You could at least have the
balls to admit it.

38:58.990 --> 39:02.989
Wait, I'm sorry...
>> you didn't orchestrate it?

39:02.990 --> 39:03.990
No.

39:03.991 --> 39:05.409
It wasn't your idea?

39:05.410 --> 39:05.990
They wanted to work with
Johnny Mac

39:05.991 --> 39:08.989
no, they wanted to get me out
and you were working with them

39:08.990 --> 39:11.989
and it was your idea to
orchestrate the five-person

39:11.990 --> 39:13.989
alliance to do it, weren't you?

39:13.990 --> 39:17.829
I would be breathing heavy if I
were you, too, good-bye.

39:17.830 --> 39:20.990
All right.

39:45.990 --> 39:48.989
It would be great for my game
if Vanessa would use the veto,

39:48.990 --> 39:52.989
but it would probably hurt her
game it if she used it.

39:52.990 --> 39:55.990
But hopefully she uses it.

39:58.290 --> 40:00.999
I'm really nervous about this
veto meeting because Vanessa's

40:01.000 --> 40:05.989
really mad about everything's
that's gone down this week.

40:05.990 --> 40:08.989
The scamper squad might be
breaking up and I might not be

40:08.990 --> 40:10.989
the pawn Austin originally
thought I was.

40:10.990 --> 40:14.119
I feel so alone in this game
right now, and super betrayed by

40:14.120 --> 40:16.989
the people they thought were
closest to me.

40:16.990 --> 40:18.989
By some stroke of luck, I
managed to win the power of

40:18.990 --> 40:26.989
veto, and I'm pretty sure that's
the only reason I'm still here.

40:26.990 --> 40:27.830
Okay, everybody.

40:27.831 --> 40:35.831
It's time for the veto meeting.

40:43.990 --> 40:45.409
This is veto meeting.

40:45.410 --> 40:48.989
Steve and John have been
nominated for eviction but I

40:48.990 --> 40:51.989
have the power to veto one of
the nominations.

40:51.990 --> 40:55.949
I want to give both of the
nominees a chance to tell me why

40:55.950 --> 40:58.989
you think I should use the veto
to save you.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.989
Steve, you go first.

41:00.990 --> 41:04.119
Congratulations, again, on
winning a classic "Big Brother"

41:04.120 --> 41:04.990
veto comp.

41:04.991 --> 41:08.989
And aside from that, I will
gladly respect whatever

41:08.990 --> 41:13.989
strategic decision you need to
make.

41:13.990 --> 41:16.989
John, now it's your turn to
speak.

41:16.990 --> 41:18.119
All right.

41:18.120 --> 41:21.289
I feel like I've been in this
position before.

41:21.290 --> 41:25.989
But in this situation, I feel
like me asking you to use the

41:25.990 --> 41:29.989
veto on me would be like a
gazelle asking a tiger, hey,

41:29.990 --> 41:33.699
let's hang out and not eat each
other.

41:33.700 --> 41:34.989
It's not going to go well.

41:34.990 --> 41:38.989
Don't use the veto on me.

41:38.990 --> 41:41.989
Last week, both of the
nominees were part of a plan to

41:41.990 --> 41:42.990
target me this week.

41:42.991 --> 41:45.989
Right after I was picked to play
in the veto meeting, Steve comes

41:45.990 --> 41:49.989
up to me and gives me a big old
hug and tells me just how happy

41:49.990 --> 41:52.989
he is that I got picked to play
in the veto competition.

41:52.990 --> 41:55.989
I bet you were even more happy
when I won it.

41:55.990 --> 42:03.990
Needless to say, I have decided
to not use the power of veto.

42:09.990 --> 42:14.540
This veto meeting is adjourned.

42:17.990 --> 42:21.949
I'll do whatever I have to do
to stay in this game, and if

42:21.950 --> 42:26.409
Steve has to go, like, I don't
care.

42:26.410 --> 42:29.409
I am really confused about
what's going on here.

42:29.410 --> 42:32.949
I'm really worried about this
because I think Vanessa is about

42:32.950 --> 42:35.949
to stay this week and if I don't
have her vote I could be in a

42:35.950 --> 42:35.990
lot of trouble.

42:35.991 --> 42:38.989
It's a terrible feeling to
find out what the whole house

42:38.990 --> 42:43.289
wanted you out, but it's kind of
a good moment when you are able

42:43.290 --> 42:47.989
to fend for yourself, win's
competition, get that veto

42:47.990 --> 42:49.989
around your neck and have the
last laugh.

42:49.990 --> 42:54.289
Who will be evicted from the
"Big Brother" house, Steve or

42:54.290 --> 42:54.990
John?

42:54.991 --> 42:57.989
Plus, the jurors return to
battle it out for the chance to

42:57.990 --> 43:00.409
get back into the game.

43:00.410 --> 43:07.410
It all happens live tomorrow at
9:00, 8:00 central on "big
brother."
