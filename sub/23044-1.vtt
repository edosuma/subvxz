- No?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.770
- No.

01:43.521 --> 01:46.024
- I'm looking for Miss Langford.
- Have you seen her?

01:46.106 --> 01:47.984
- No. No. Sorry.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.488
- Hi! Uh, Miss Langford?

01:53.531 --> 01:55.033
- No.
- Sorry.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.784
- Sorry.

01:58.536 --> 02:00.329
- Mr. Pittman!
- Excuse me. Mr. Pittman?

02:00.412 --> 02:02.874
- Yeah, just give me one second?
- Uh, uh...

02:02.957 --> 02:04.458

02:08.151 --> 02:09.672
let me just finish this up here.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.672
- Uh, uh...

02:09.755 --> 02:11.194
Miss Langford <i> is</i> representing

02:11.195 --> 02:12.633
the Home & Hearth Gifts company

02:12.717 --> 02:14.259
at this event, is she not?

02:14.343 --> 02:15.344
- She certainly is.

02:15.345 --> 02:16.345
Almost done here.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.160
- Well, she was supposed to do

02:18.161 --> 02:19.891
her presentation 20 minutes ago!

02:19.974 --> 02:21.433
I-I-I can't find her anywhere.

02:21.517 --> 02:22.810
- Yes!

02:22.811 --> 02:24.103
Now that's how we close it!

02:24.186 --> 02:25.729
I'm sorry. Hi.

02:25.730 --> 02:27.272
What was it you wanted?

02:28.566 --> 02:29.921
- Mr. Pittman,

02:29.922 --> 02:31.276
where is your fiancée?

02:41.913 --> 02:43.164
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

02:48.920 --> 02:50.213
Alright! Ten out of ten

02:50.214 --> 02:51.505
from the Russian judge.

02:51.589 --> 02:53.507
- Thank you. Thank you.

02:53.591 --> 02:55.155
Years of gymnastics.

02:55.156 --> 02:56.719
Not easily forgotten.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.429
Oh, thank you.

03:00.890 --> 03:02.413
- For my favourite charity.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.020
- Toys For Tots thanks you
- for your generosity.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.025
- I'll double it

03:11.026 --> 03:12.526
if you can vault that.

03:12.610 --> 03:13.862
- Oh, forget it.

03:13.863 --> 03:15.113
- Chicken?

03:16.030 --> 03:17.656
I'll quadruple it.

03:17.740 --> 03:18.991
That's a lotta toys

03:18.992 --> 03:20.242
for a lotta tots.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.788
Come on, Ellen!

03:23.871 --> 03:25.060
She's gonna do it!

03:29.460 --> 03:30.941
- Fine. But I want that check

03:30.942 --> 03:32.421
immediately.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.256
- I'll write it now.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.602
Ooh!

03:48.646 --> 03:50.272
- Uh!

03:52.274 --> 03:53.651
- Miss Langford!

03:53.652 --> 03:55.027
- Oh! Ah! Ah!!

04:01.410 --> 04:02.493
- What...?

04:18.466 --> 04:20.260
"Party Heiress..."

04:34.692 --> 04:36.276
- ..."Where socialite
- Ellen Langford,

04:36.360 --> 04:37.737
Heiress to the Home & Hearth

04:37.738 --> 04:39.113
Gifts retail fortune,

04:39.197 --> 04:41.448
was up to the very same hijinks

04:41.532 --> 04:43.075
that gained her

04:43.076 --> 04:44.618
the "Party Heiress" nickname

04:41.532 --> 04:44.618
to begin with...

04:44.702 --> 04:46.495
- Alice, is my daughter in yet?

04:46.578 --> 04:47.746
- No, she's in the boardroom.

04:47.747 --> 04:48.914
Sir, shall I get her...

04:48.998 --> 04:50.791
- No, I will get her.

05:05.681 --> 05:07.307
- Hey.

05:07.391 --> 05:09.227
Now, I have been thinking.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.707
I think it's time

05:10.708 --> 05:12.104
for a snappier tag line.

05:12.188 --> 05:13.752
"The Home of Heartfelt Gifts"?

05:13.753 --> 05:15.315
It's a little old-school.

05:15.399 --> 05:17.068
- Right now,

05:17.151 --> 05:18.298
this is the only tag line

05:18.299 --> 05:19.444
I'm interested in.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.241
- Oh.
- Yeah.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.929
Oh. I just spent an hour

05:24.930 --> 05:26.535
on the phone

05:26.618 --> 05:28.057
with Mrs. Worthington...

05:28.058 --> 05:29.496
talking her off a ledge!

05:29.580 --> 05:31.249
- It was for charity.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.624
Someone dared me.

05:32.708 --> 05:33.959
- Someone "dared" you?!

05:34.043 --> 05:36.295
How old are you, 12?!

05:37.337 --> 05:39.173
- Ellen,
- when you are out in public,

05:39.257 --> 05:40.901
- You are an ambassador
- for this company.

05:40.925 --> 05:42.114
And once you are CEO,

05:42.115 --> 05:43.302
you will be the face

05:43.385 --> 05:45.096
of this company.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.098
- So...
- you've made up your mind...

05:47.181 --> 05:48.724
About retiring?

05:48.807 --> 05:50.747
- I thought that I had.

05:50.748 --> 05:52.686
Now I'm not certain that I dare!

05:53.562 --> 05:55.314
I need to leave this place

05:55.439 --> 05:56.461
in the hands

05:56.462 --> 05:57.482
of someone I can trust.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.903
- I'm sorry.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.780
- You can do better than this.

06:02.863 --> 06:06.158
Please. For all of our sakes.

06:23.051 --> 06:24.218
<i>I don't know, Alice.</i>

06:21.882 --> 06:24.218
<i>Maybe it's my fault.</i>

06:24.302 --> 06:26.553
You know, after Nora died, I...

06:26.637 --> 06:27.680
Let Ellie get away

06:27.681 --> 06:28.722
with too much.

06:28.806 --> 06:30.933
You know, to make up for it.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.164
You think

06:32.165 --> 06:33.311
I... spoiled her a bit?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.812
- No. Doesn't every kid

06:34.813 --> 06:36.230
get a Ferrari for Christmas?

06:37.773 --> 06:39.066
- Funny.

06:39.150 --> 06:41.193
- I almost forgot...

06:42.402 --> 06:44.155
...the most important thing.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.448
It's your turn

06:46.449 --> 06:47.866
to write the Christmas letter.

06:49.827 --> 06:51.099
- Oh.

06:52.454 --> 06:53.935
- Have you given any thought

06:53.936 --> 06:55.415
to what you're going to write

06:52.454 --> 06:55.415
in your letter this year?

06:55.499 --> 06:57.626
- Hey, Dad.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.044
Sorry, Alice. I was wondering

06:59.045 --> 07:00.379
if you wanted to grab lunch.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.423
- Sweetie, I-I'm sorry,

07:02.424 --> 07:04.383
but I've got a conference call

07:00.462 --> 07:04.383
at one o'clock.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.302
I'll move that to 3:00.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.304
He's all yours.

07:08.387 --> 07:10.306
- Really? Great!

07:12.266 --> 07:13.976
Dad, I'm really sorry.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.394
- No.

07:15.477 --> 07:16.729
Look... Oh, thank you.

07:16.730 --> 07:17.980
Ellie, it's not just you.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.898
It-it's on me too.

07:19.982 --> 07:21.984
- Look.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.673
I want to do more

07:23.674 --> 07:25.279
than just apologize.

07:25.363 --> 07:27.365
I want to... do something...

07:27.447 --> 07:29.116
to... to make this right.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.951
- Honey, you don't have to.

07:31.035 --> 07:32.870
- I do, though. For you,

07:32.953 --> 07:35.122
for the company... for Mom.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.791
And for me.

07:37.875 --> 07:38.960
I want to prove to you

07:38.961 --> 07:40.044
that I'm not...

07:40.127 --> 07:41.212
just a party girl,

07:41.213 --> 07:42.296
that I can take charge.

07:42.380 --> 07:44.715
- Okay. Great.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.050
- Cool.

07:46.051 --> 07:47.301
- What did you have in mind?

07:49.469 --> 07:50.929
Well, I'm...

07:51.013 --> 07:52.786
I haven't really...

07:52.787 --> 07:54.558
figured anything out yet,

07:54.641 --> 07:56.727
but...

07:56.810 --> 07:58.500
uh... Oh!

07:58.501 --> 08:00.189
What if I did another fundraiser

07:56.810 --> 08:00.189
for Toys for Tots?

08:00.272 --> 08:01.419
Maybe, like, uh... uh...

08:01.420 --> 08:02.566
I don't know.

08:02.649 --> 08:03.984
Oh, Valentine's Day!

08:04.068 --> 08:06.404
- We could do a big, flashy party
- and...

08:06.486 --> 08:07.487
And I could get the press

08:07.488 --> 08:08.488
involved...

08:08.572 --> 08:10.490
Ellie, sweetie... uh...

08:10.574 --> 08:11.867
See, the thing is,

08:11.868 --> 08:13.160
you're worrying

08:10.574 --> 08:13.160
about our public image.

08:13.244 --> 08:14.620
- Yep.

08:14.621 --> 08:15.996
- Which is great.

08:13.244 --> 08:15.996
You know, I mean I do too.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.728
But... the thing that I think

08:17.729 --> 08:19.375
you need to learn

08:19.458 --> 08:21.314
a little something about is...

08:21.315 --> 08:23.170
is the spirit of the company,

08:23.254 --> 08:24.756
which is really all about

08:24.757 --> 08:26.257
the people who buy our gifts.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.966
- Right.
- Ordinary people who lead

08:28.050 --> 08:29.218
Very different lives

08:29.219 --> 08:30.386
than you or I.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.136
- Mm-hmm. I hear you.

08:32.221 --> 08:33.534
- Most of our buyers,

08:33.535 --> 08:34.847
they're small-town folks.

08:34.932 --> 08:36.640
You know, they...

08:38.518 --> 08:39.832
Oh, wait a second.

08:39.832 --> 08:41.145
I think I just figured it out.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.149
What you can do.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.234
- Really?

08:45.235 --> 08:46.235
- Yeah.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.235
- What?

08:46.318 --> 08:47.382
I need you to take a trip

08:47.383 --> 08:48.446
for me.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.072
A business trip.

08:50.155 --> 08:51.865
- Okay.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.513
- I need you to deliver

08:53.514 --> 08:55.077
the Christmas letters

08:51.949 --> 08:55.077
to Uncle Zeke.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.747
You... you want me

08:58.830 --> 08:59.978
To go to Snow Falls?

08:59.979 --> 09:01.125
- Mm-hmm.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.710
It's my turn to deliver

09:02.711 --> 09:04.211
the letters this year,

09:04.295 --> 09:05.525
but... I think

09:05.526 --> 09:06.755
you should go instead.

09:06.838 --> 09:07.965
You know,

09:07.966 --> 09:09.091
see where it all began.

09:09.174 --> 09:11.927
- Okay... When?

09:13.053 --> 09:15.306
<i> Tonight? Really?</i>

09:15.389 --> 09:16.933
You're kidding

09:16.934 --> 09:18.476
- It's not a big deal, babe.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.893
- Yeah, but what about Maui?

09:19.894 --> 09:21.228
I mean, those tickets

09:18.558 --> 09:21.228
are non-refundable.

09:21.312 --> 09:22.772
- We don't leave

09:22.773 --> 09:24.231
until Christmas Eve.

09:21.312 --> 09:24.231
I'll be back in plenty of time.

09:24.315 --> 09:25.608
- And you gotta do

09:25.609 --> 09:26.900
this whole trip on 100 bucks

09:24.315 --> 09:26.900
and a roundtrip ticket?

09:26.984 --> 09:28.861
- I can do it. I've already got

09:28.862 --> 09:30.737
somewhere to stay.

09:30.821 --> 09:32.323
Uncle Zeke owns

09:32.324 --> 09:33.824
this beautiful inn up there.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.907
- It's really cool.
- Yeah, but why just 100 bucks?

09:35.951 --> 09:37.620
- Because that's all

09:37.621 --> 09:39.288
Uncle Zeke and Dad had

09:35.951 --> 09:39.288
when they started out.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.539
- Ugh.

09:40.540 --> 09:41.706
- Come on.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.584
I think this is a cute idea.

09:44.668 --> 09:46.190
- Okay, and if you do this,

09:46.191 --> 09:47.712
uh... "challenge,"

09:47.796 --> 09:50.174
you get to run the whole outfit?

09:50.257 --> 09:51.634
- Okay, don't make this sound

09:51.635 --> 09:53.010
like a gangster movie.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.512
But yes.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.430
- A hundred bucks
- is not a lot of money.

09:56.514 --> 09:57.782
- You better bring
- your credit cards.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.266
- I can't.
- It's part of the rules.

10:00.456 --> 10:01.560
That's insane.

10:01.643 --> 10:02.707
- Besides, all my cards

10:02.708 --> 10:03.770
have my name on them.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.022
- Yeah. So what?
- Oh...

10:05.105 --> 10:06.940
That's another part of the deal.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.276
See, people treat you

10:08.277 --> 10:09.527
a little bit differently

10:09.609 --> 10:10.756
when they know

10:10.757 --> 10:11.903
that you're inheriting

10:11.987 --> 10:13.927
a multimillion dollar company,

10:13.928 --> 10:15.866
so I have to go incognito.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.160
- Baby...

10:18.243 --> 10:20.120
- why are you doing this
- to yourself?

10:20.204 --> 10:21.746
- Because...

10:21.830 --> 10:23.645
I'm tired of people seeing me

10:23.646 --> 10:25.459
as some dumb rich kid.

10:25.543 --> 10:26.669
I want to prove

10:26.670 --> 10:27.794
to my father -

10:27.878 --> 10:29.547
and to myself - that...

10:29.629 --> 10:31.110
that I can take care of things

10:31.111 --> 10:32.591
on my own.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.072
And not I'm not just

10:34.073 --> 10:35.469
the "Party Heiress."

10:36.636 --> 10:39.223
- Uh... Oh, yeah, that's...

10:39.306 --> 10:41.100
So... what's all this about,

10:41.101 --> 10:42.893
anyway?

10:43.852 --> 10:44.853
- The Christmas Letters?

10:44.854 --> 10:45.854
- Yeah.

10:45.937 --> 10:46.938
Have a look

10:46.939 --> 10:47.939
at that greeting card.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.939
On the back.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.797
It's the original business plan

10:50.798 --> 10:52.486
for Home & Hearth Gifts.

10:52.570 --> 10:54.009
When my Uncle Zeke and Dad

10:54.010 --> 10:55.447
came up with the idea,

10:55.531 --> 10:56.866
they just grabbed

10:56.867 --> 10:58.200
the nearest thing

10:55.531 --> 10:58.200
and wrote it down.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.077
- What about all these letters?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.578
- Well, every Christmas,

11:01.579 --> 11:02.996
they write each other,

11:00.160 --> 11:02.996
like, a...

11:03.080 --> 11:04.644
a sort of newsletter to say

11:04.645 --> 11:06.208
what had happened that year,

11:06.291 --> 11:08.252
good or bad.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.149
- Wouldn't it be easier to just,

11:10.150 --> 11:11.963
you know, send an email?

11:08.335 --> 11:11.963
- Look at the dates.

11:12.047 --> 11:13.257
Some of those letters

11:13.258 --> 11:14.466
go way back before email.

11:15.593 --> 11:17.595
Oh. Anyway, the whole point

11:17.677 --> 11:19.555
is that they're forced

11:19.556 --> 11:21.432
to get together every Christmas.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.267
It's like a company tradition.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.352
- Anyway...

11:26.311 --> 11:27.854
- Yeah, we should get going.

11:27.938 --> 11:29.064
The traffic to the airport's

11:29.065 --> 11:30.190
probably crazy right now.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.360
- Uh, did you take a look

11:33.361 --> 11:34.653
at the ticket

11:32.067 --> 11:34.653
your father gave you?

11:34.736 --> 11:37.072
- No. Why?

11:37.155 --> 11:39.450
- Well... let's just say

11:39.533 --> 11:40.826
we won't have to worry

11:40.827 --> 11:42.119
about airport traffic.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.769
<i> The Port Authority</i>

11:45.770 --> 11:47.583
<i>Bus Terminal welcomes you</i>

11:43.954 --> 11:47.583
<i>to New York City.</i>

11:47.666 --> 11:49.251

11:49.334 --> 11:50.628
Ho-ho-ho!

11:50.710 --> 11:52.379
- Here you go. Okay?

11:52.463 --> 11:53.735
And remember,

11:53.736 --> 11:55.006
this only works if nobody knows

11:55.090 --> 11:56.154
who you are.

11:56.155 --> 11:57.217
- Got it.

11:57.301 --> 11:58.469
- Right? Good.
- Ahem.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.762
- And say hi to Zeke for me.
- I will.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.451
And don't worry about me, okay?

12:02.452 --> 12:04.057
I can take care of myself

12:05.809 --> 12:07.769
I can.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.062
- Yeah.

12:09.063 --> 12:10.272
- Ahem. Alright.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.024
- Oh, Ellie?

12:12.025 --> 12:13.692
Your, uh, credit cards?

12:13.775 --> 12:15.611
- Oh, right.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.281
- Thank you.
- Okay...

12:19.364 --> 12:20.991
- The platinum?

12:27.872 --> 12:30.125
Nice try.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.128
- Bye.
- <i>Bon voyage.</i>

<i>Augusta, Waterville</i>

12:40.344 --> 12:41.886

12:41.970 --> 12:43.493
- Hi there.

12:43.494 --> 12:45.015
Is this baggage check?

12:47.184 --> 12:48.893
- Sure.
- Great.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.208
Uh, there are a couple

12:50.209 --> 12:51.438
of delicate items in here.

12:51.522 --> 12:53.024
If you could just make sure

12:53.025 --> 12:54.525
they don't bounce around

12:51.522 --> 12:54.525
too much.

12:54.608 --> 12:55.713
- Got it.

12:55.714 --> 12:56.818
- Thank you!

13:08.955 --> 13:11.458
- I'm sorry. Ooh!

13:13.084 --> 13:15.128
Oh, excuse me.

13:15.212 --> 13:16.714
Whoop!

13:16.796 --> 13:17.839
Whoa!

13:17.840 --> 13:18.882
- Careful there, hon.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.634
- Uh, I'm sorry. I'm just...

13:20.635 --> 13:22.302
I'm trying to find my seat,

13:22.386 --> 13:23.616
but I... I can't see

13:23.617 --> 13:24.846
any seat numbers.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.265
- Well, that...
- that's because there aren't any.

13:27.349 --> 13:28.475
- Well, how would you know

13:28.476 --> 13:29.601
where to sit?

13:29.685 --> 13:31.353
- I don't know...

13:31.436 --> 13:33.146
You just... sit.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.190
- Well...
- Oh, here.

13:35.273 --> 13:37.150
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

13:37.234 --> 13:38.860
- Okay.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.806
- Are you looking for something?

13:46.807 --> 13:48.161
- The call button.

13:48.245 --> 13:49.829
- The what?

13:49.913 --> 13:51.290
- The call button?

13:51.291 --> 13:52.666
You know, for the attendant?

13:52.750 --> 13:54.147
I could really use

13:54.148 --> 13:55.544
a glass of wine.

13:55.627 --> 13:56.837
- You don't ride the bus much,

13:56.838 --> 13:58.046
do you?

13:58.129 --> 13:59.444
- Just between you and me,

13:59.445 --> 14:00.758
it's my first time.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.133
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

14:02.217 --> 14:03.969
- Well, I'm an old hand at it.

14:03.970 --> 14:05.721
Kathy Garver.

14:05.804 --> 14:08.098
- I'm Ellen Lang...

14:08.181 --> 14:10.475
Uh, never mind.

14:10.559 --> 14:12.477

Sorry. I'm still half-asleep.

Ahem. Uh... thank you very much.

15:21.338 --> 15:24.007
You don't have change for 100.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.219
- It's alright.

15:27.220 --> 15:28.303

Oh! Uh...

15:40.607 --> 15:43.026
Merry Christmas to you too!

15:49.949 --> 15:51.910
Hey, be careful!

15:55.497 --> 15:59.000
No! Watch out! Ah!

16:03.338 --> 16:04.923
Ugh!

16:05.965 --> 16:07.718
Oh... God.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.761
Ugh!

16:09.845 --> 16:11.534
- What are you trying to do,

16:11.535 --> 16:13.223
lady, cause an accident?

16:09.845 --> 16:13.223
- You hit my suitcase!

16:13.306 --> 16:14.474
- Yeah, what's your suitcase

16:14.475 --> 16:15.642
doing in the road?

16:15.726 --> 16:17.165
- Well, the...

16:17.166 --> 16:18.603
I just took my eyes off it

16:18.687 --> 16:20.147
for one second

16:20.148 --> 16:21.606
and some guy just came and...

16:21.690 --> 16:23.066
- Some guy?

16:23.067 --> 16:24.442
- Yes! Ugh.

16:24.526 --> 16:25.736
- Alright.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.987
Let's get you...

16:35.579 --> 16:37.748
You need a cab?

16:37.831 --> 16:39.499
- Not from you, thank you.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.167
I will wait.

16:41.251 --> 16:42.836
- Well, you might be waiting

16:42.837 --> 16:44.421
a real long time.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.110
This is a one-taxi kinda town.

16:46.111 --> 16:47.716
- Well, fine.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.009
I'll just... I'll Uber.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.554
- Yeah... No.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.348
Lyft?

16:55.432 --> 16:56.913
- You might as well be speaking

16:56.914 --> 16:58.393
a foreign language here.

16:58.476 --> 16:59.832
Besides, we're not so good

16:59.833 --> 17:01.187
on cell reception either.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.482
That's great.

17:05.442 --> 17:06.944
Ugh.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.403
- Look...

17:08.486 --> 17:10.363
Why don't you hop in?

17:10.446 --> 17:11.594
It's on the house.

17:11.595 --> 17:12.741
It's the least I can do.

17:15.452 --> 17:17.036
Hey. Trust me.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.373
I am your best option right now.

17:34.930 --> 17:36.723
- Ho-ho-ho!

17:44.272 --> 17:46.190
- So you're from New York?

17:47.484 --> 17:49.360
- Yeah. How'd you know?

17:49.444 --> 17:52.030
- Ah, you just got that look.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.992
- What look?

17:55.074 --> 17:56.952
- Uh, just...

17:58.286 --> 17:59.955
- You were on the second bus
- of the day,

18:00.038 --> 18:01.915
- And the second bus of the day
- is New York.

18:01.999 --> 18:03.834
- Oh.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.460
Have you ever been?

18:06.711 --> 18:08.338
- Yeah, I've been.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.425
- And what did you think?

18:13.927 --> 18:16.304
- Came back here, didn't I?

18:21.100 --> 18:22.894
- Okay.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.963
Oh, thanks for the ride.

18:52.592 --> 18:53.842
- No problem.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.476
So, you got a reservation?

19:03.560 --> 19:05.312
- You work here too?

19:05.313 --> 19:07.064
- Yes. I am the manager.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.024
Jake Collins.

19:11.401 --> 19:12.819
Nice to meet you.

19:12.903 --> 19:14.029
I just drive the taxi

19:14.030 --> 19:15.154
when Herman's gout acts up.

19:15.238 --> 19:17.281
- Oh. Well, uh...

19:17.365 --> 19:18.888
I am actually here

19:18.889 --> 19:20.410
to see the owner.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.599
- Zeke.

19:21.600 --> 19:22.704
- Yes. Is he around?

19:22.787 --> 19:24.640
- You just missed him.
- He left town this morning.

19:24.664 --> 19:25.936
- What?!

19:25.937 --> 19:27.208
- Kelly, he say

19:24.664 --> 19:27.208
when he's gonna be back?

19:27.291 --> 19:29.210
- You've met Zeke, right?

19:29.293 --> 19:30.315
- Yeah. Our boss

19:30.316 --> 19:31.337
and his mysterious

19:31.421 --> 19:33.131
- "communing with the elements"
- trips.

19:33.214 --> 19:34.966
Mere mortals are

19:34.967 --> 19:36.718
not welcome to that information.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.302
That's his words, not mine.

19:39.826 --> 19:41.264
- Did he say

19:38.386 --> 19:41.264
how long he was going for?

19:41.347 --> 19:42.911
- Kelly?

19:42.912 --> 19:44.475
- All he said was, and I quote -

19:44.559 --> 19:47.311
"I'll be back when I'm back."

19:47.395 --> 19:49.689
- Seems like he's gonna be back
- when he's back.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.442
- Can you please call him

19:51.443 --> 19:53.110
and just tell him that I'm here?

19:53.192 --> 19:55.862
It's Ellen Ian... London.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.407
- Yeah... like I said,

19:58.408 --> 19:59.783
reception here's a disaster.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.618
And besides, Zeke's not really

20:01.619 --> 20:03.369
a cellphone kind of guy.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.163
- Yeah, but... but my father...

20:08.207 --> 20:09.855
I just... I just thought

20:09.856 --> 20:11.502
that he knew that I was coming.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.756
- Well, he didn't say anything
- to me. Sorry.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.132
So, you still want that room

20:16.133 --> 20:17.425
or not, Miss Lang-London?

20:17.508 --> 20:21.763
- No, it's actually just London.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.681
Ellie London.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.685
- Ellie London.
- There's a landline in the room,

20:25.767 --> 20:28.019
- But I'm gonna have to charge you
- for it.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.146
- That's fine.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.230
- Cookies are free though.
- Mm.

20:33.858 --> 20:35.693
- Great.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.951
<i>- Really? He's not there?</i>

20:43.034 --> 20:44.845
You know,
- that's just like him.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.204
Ever since Zeke retired,

20:46.205 --> 20:47.538
he's lost all track of time.

20:47.622 --> 20:49.332
<i>- So what am I supposed
- to do now?</i>

20:49.415 --> 20:51.126
- Well, you're already
- at the inn,

20:51.209 --> 20:52.690
So why don't you just relax,

20:52.691 --> 20:54.171
make yourself at home

20:54.253 --> 20:55.359
and hopefully he'll show up

20:55.360 --> 20:56.464
tomorrow morning.

20:56.547 --> 20:57.924
- But what if he doesn't?

20:58.008 --> 20:59.968
- Can I just leave
- the Christmas Letters

21:00.051 --> 21:01.616
At the front desk and...

21:01.617 --> 21:03.180
and come back to New York?

21:03.262 --> 21:05.285
- No, honey. I'm sorry,

21:05.286 --> 21:07.308
you must put it into his hand.

21:07.391 --> 21:08.997
That's the tradition.

21:08.998 --> 21:10.603
And that's our deal.

21:10.687 --> 21:12.439
- But Dad... It's nearly

21:12.440 --> 21:14.191
three days until Christmas Eve.

21:14.315 --> 21:15.608
Ah, crap! Hello?

21:16.985 --> 21:18.091
- Uh... I'm sorry, honey,

21:18.092 --> 21:19.196
I can't hear you very well.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.198
We've got a bad connection.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.657
- I said it's only three days

21:22.658 --> 21:24.034
until Christmas Eve

21:24.117 --> 21:25.535
and I promised Gray...

21:25.618 --> 21:26.870
- Hello? Hello?

21:28.977 --> 21:30.081
- Hello?!

21:36.713 --> 21:37.944
No!

21:42.177 --> 21:43.970
Just a minute!

21:51.936 --> 21:53.855
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:53.938 --> 21:55.523
- Here's your change.
- Oh.

21:55.606 --> 21:56.795
- Sorry that took so long.

21:56.796 --> 21:57.984
I had to go down to the safe,

21:58.068 --> 21:59.908
- we don't get a lot of hundreds
- around here.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.425
- Yeah, uh, have you heard

22:01.426 --> 22:02.864
from Zeke yet?

22:02.947 --> 22:04.615
- Nothing, sorry.

22:04.699 --> 22:07.244
So look, if you get hungry,

22:07.326 --> 22:08.599
Debbie's Café,

22:08.600 --> 22:09.871
just around the corner.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.164
- Thanks, but I think

22:11.165 --> 22:12.373
I'll just order room service.

22:13.624 --> 22:14.876
What?

22:14.959 --> 22:18.004
- Debbie's Café is room service.

22:18.088 --> 22:19.548
Come on, I'll walk you over.

22:19.549 --> 22:21.007
I gotta get coffee there anyway.

22:22.759 --> 22:24.010
- Okay.

22:35.772 --> 22:38.149
- It gets dark fast around here.

22:38.233 --> 22:40.610
- You're in the Deep North now,
- Miss.

22:46.199 --> 22:47.555
- Ho ho ho! Well, thank you

22:47.556 --> 22:48.910
very much, young Jake!

22:48.993 --> 22:50.703
A very Merry Christmas to you.

22:50.787 --> 22:53.497
And you too, beautiful lady!

22:53.581 --> 22:55.250
Thanks.

22:59.796 --> 23:01.923
- Forget your change upstairs?

23:02.006 --> 23:03.341
- No.

23:03.424 --> 23:05.281
No, I'm just on a bit

23:05.282 --> 23:07.137
of a... budget.

23:07.220 --> 23:08.846
- Hm.

23:10.223 --> 23:11.850
- Besides, my fiancé says giving

23:11.851 --> 23:13.476
money to the homeless

23:13.559 --> 23:14.727
actually hurts them.

23:16.230 --> 23:17.647
- That's ridiculous.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.628
- Well, I'm not sure

23:19.629 --> 23:21.525
I agree with him,

23:21.609 --> 23:23.527
but think about it,

23:23.611 --> 23:25.384
giving charity makes us feel

23:25.385 --> 23:27.157
good, but it's really selfish.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.554
I mean, are we helping

23:28.555 --> 23:29.867
the homeless

23:29.951 --> 23:31.328
by giving them money

23:31.410 --> 23:33.306
- or should we be encouraging them
- to earn their own?

23:33.330 --> 23:35.999
- That's a nice theory.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.210
I think in practice,

23:38.211 --> 23:40.337
Baxter back there probably

23:36.082 --> 23:40.337
appreciates every penny

23:40.419 --> 23:41.566
that gets him closer

23:41.567 --> 23:42.713
to a warm meal.

23:44.257 --> 23:45.675
Come on.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.504
- Wow, this place is

24:02.505 --> 24:03.901
really packed.

24:03.985 --> 24:05.278
I should have made

24:05.279 --> 24:06.570
a reservation.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.281
- Luckily, I know the owner.

24:08.365 --> 24:09.887
- Hey, Jakey, you're just

24:09.888 --> 24:11.409
in time for your favorite.

24:11.492 --> 24:12.806
- Thanks, Aunt Debbie,

24:12.807 --> 24:14.120
but I'm just here to pick up

24:14.204 --> 24:15.330
the coffee for the morning.

24:15.331 --> 24:16.455
- Don't be silly.

24:16.539 --> 24:18.416
- The chef saved you
- some clam chowder

24:18.499 --> 24:19.751
And you know

24:19.752 --> 24:21.002
you don't wanna upset the chef!

24:21.085 --> 24:22.461
I'm the chef.

24:22.545 --> 24:23.797
- Oh!

24:23.798 --> 24:25.048
- How about you?

24:25.131 --> 24:26.811
- Something to eat,
- something to drink...

24:26.883 --> 24:28.259
Some warmer clothes?

24:28.343 --> 24:29.469
- She'll survive.

24:29.470 --> 24:30.594
She's just here the night.

24:30.678 --> 24:32.117
- Well, thank you for choosing

24:32.118 --> 24:33.556
to bring your date

24:30.678 --> 24:33.556
to our humble establishment.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.120
- Oh! I'm not his date.

24:35.121 --> 24:36.600
- No.

24:36.684 --> 24:38.353
This is Ellie London,

24:38.354 --> 24:40.021
she's a guest at the inn.

24:40.104 --> 24:42.190
- Guest. Hi.

24:42.273 --> 24:44.608
- Okay. Not-a-date.

24:44.692 --> 24:47.570
And just one night?

24:47.987 --> 24:49.613
Oh, that's too bad.

24:49.697 --> 24:51.324
- You're gonna miss
- Dinner With Santa.

24:51.408 --> 24:53.577
It's a Christmas Eve tradition

24:53.578 --> 24:55.745
here. We set up a Santa House

24:55.828 --> 24:57.496
in the church hall for the kids

24:57.580 --> 24:59.540
and we raise money for charity.

25:00.708 --> 25:02.001
- Ms. London has a...

25:02.085 --> 25:03.628
complicated relationship

25:03.629 --> 25:05.171
with charity.

25:05.255 --> 25:06.839
- I do not!

25:06.923 --> 25:08.632
I... don't.

25:08.716 --> 25:10.385
- We have dinner and dancing

25:10.386 --> 25:12.053
and a silent auction.

25:12.136 --> 25:13.846
It's fun! You should stay.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.890
- I can't. I have to go back

25:15.891 --> 25:17.850
to New York.

25:17.934 --> 25:19.643
I'm just here to see Zeke.

25:19.727 --> 25:21.479
- Zeke Daniels?

25:21.562 --> 25:23.002
Well, you're in the right place.

25:23.003 --> 25:24.441
He comes in here all the time.

25:24.565 --> 25:26.859
You see that table right there?

25:26.943 --> 25:29.446
That is where it all began.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.989
Zeke Daniels and Jim Langford

25:30.990 --> 25:32.449
came up with the idea

25:32.531 --> 25:34.409
for Home & Hearth Gifts

25:34.410 --> 25:36.286
right in that booth.

25:36.369 --> 25:37.725
Who knows? If it wasn't

25:37.726 --> 25:39.080
for my little diner,

25:39.163 --> 25:40.352
their whole

25:40.353 --> 25:41.540
multimillion-dollar company

25:41.624 --> 25:42.750
might've never gotten off

25:42.751 --> 25:43.876
the ground.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.003
How do you know Zeke?

25:46.087 --> 25:47.880
- Oh, uh, I...

25:47.964 --> 25:51.675
am a friend of the family.

25:51.759 --> 25:53.677
Do you know Jim Langford too?

25:53.761 --> 25:55.554
- Know him?

25:55.638 --> 25:57.015
I dated him all my senior year

25:57.016 --> 25:58.391
of high school.

25:58.475 --> 26:02.561
- You dated m... Mr. Langford?

26:02.645 --> 26:05.440
- Yeah. Until he met Nora.

26:05.523 --> 26:07.505
I so wanted to hate her,

26:07.506 --> 26:09.486
but she was the sweetest thing.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.862
And smart as a whip.

26:11.946 --> 26:13.406
Lit up a room

26:13.407 --> 26:14.865
every time she walked in.

26:11.946 --> 26:14.865
Everybody loved her.

26:14.949 --> 26:16.909
- And she and Jim made
- a beautiful couple.

26:16.993 --> 26:18.849
- Didn't they get married

26:18.850 --> 26:20.704
at the inn?

26:16.993 --> 26:20.704
- That's right.

26:20.788 --> 26:22.499
Yeah...

26:22.581 --> 26:24.187
I heard Nora passed

26:24.188 --> 26:25.793
about 10 years ago.

26:25.876 --> 26:28.129
Poor Jim...

26:28.212 --> 26:30.923
Anyway, forgive my reminiscing.

26:31.007 --> 26:32.425
You check out the menu

26:32.426 --> 26:33.843
and I will be right back!

26:38.014 --> 26:39.516

26:39.598 --> 26:41.851
- Yeah. I'm fine.

26:43.436 --> 26:46.523
Uh... so... she's your aunt?

26:46.605 --> 26:48.232
- Yeah. I was born here,

26:48.316 --> 26:49.797
so I've got a lot of family

26:49.798 --> 26:51.277
in town.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.532
- Oh! She was a singer.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.075
- Yeah, nothing ever that big,

26:58.159 --> 27:00.370
but... a lot of local bands.

30:39.088 --> 30:40.089
- There is something

30:40.090 --> 30:41.090
in my bed.

30:42.675 --> 30:44.719
An animal.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.806
- Let's have a look.

30:53.477 --> 30:54.604
- Is she alright?

30:54.605 --> 30:55.730
Oh boy.

30:55.813 --> 30:57.189
- What?

30:57.273 --> 30:59.149
- Yeah, you are lucky.

30:59.233 --> 31:01.110
You were almost bitten by a...

31:02.486 --> 31:04.447
hot water bottle.

31:05.072 --> 31:07.241
- A what?

31:07.242 --> 31:09.410
- A bottle full of hot water.

31:10.494 --> 31:12.496
- Everything alright in here?

31:12.580 --> 31:15.100
- Yes, everything's fine, folks.
- You can go back to your rooms.

31:15.124 --> 31:16.751
The... culprit was apprehended

31:16.834 --> 31:18.232
and will be dealt with to

31:18.233 --> 31:19.629
the fullest extent of the law.

31:20.504 --> 31:22.339
Thank you.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.973
- What was it doing in there?

31:31.056 --> 31:32.579
- It was trying

31:32.580 --> 31:34.101
to keep you warm.

31:34.184 --> 31:36.207
It is a perk that we offer

31:36.208 --> 31:38.230
our guests in the wintertime.

31:38.314 --> 31:40.483
Most people enjoy it.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.756
Especially those whose sleepwear

31:42.757 --> 31:44.945
is not exactly conducive

31:40.566 --> 31:44.945
to the local climate.

31:46.739 --> 31:48.574
- Thank you. Thanks.

31:49.742 --> 31:50.764
- Extra blanket?

31:50.765 --> 31:51.786
- Good night!

32:15.351 --> 32:16.935
- Excuse me!

32:18.354 --> 32:20.606
This is not clotted cream,

32:20.690 --> 32:22.525
this is whipped cream!

32:22.608 --> 32:24.152
- I'm afraid Aunt Debbie didn't

32:24.153 --> 32:25.695
send any over with breakfast

32:25.778 --> 32:27.279
this morning, Captain Williams.

32:27.363 --> 32:28.448
- Did you think I wouldn't

32:28.449 --> 32:29.532
know the difference?

32:29.615 --> 32:31.283
Do you think me an idiot?

32:31.367 --> 32:33.076
- Of course not, sir.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.433
I would be happy to arrange

32:34.434 --> 32:35.705
for a credit on your account

32:35.788 --> 32:37.144
for the price of one pot...

32:37.145 --> 32:38.499
of clotted cream.

32:38.582 --> 32:40.042
- That's much better.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.836
- Alright.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.193
- I'm impressed. You handled

32:45.194 --> 32:46.423
that like a professional.

32:46.507 --> 32:48.426
- Who? Captain Williams?

32:48.427 --> 32:50.344
Nah, he's just a sweet old guy.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.598
You know...

32:54.682 --> 32:56.726
ever since his wife died,

32:56.809 --> 32:58.248
he comes back here every year

32:58.249 --> 32:59.687
to celebrate Christmas with us.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.313
Kind of a tradition.

33:02.733 --> 33:04.066
Excuse me.

33:05.025 --> 33:06.235
Merry Christmas,

33:06.236 --> 33:07.444
Snow Falls Guest House.

33:08.612 --> 33:09.926
Yes, hold on a sec,

33:09.927 --> 33:11.240
she's right here.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.535
- Uncle Zeke?

33:14.618 --> 33:16.638
- No, it's me. Have you been
- getting any of my messages?

33:16.662 --> 33:18.560
- Oh, sorry, babe,

33:18.561 --> 33:20.457
there's no reception up here.

33:20.541 --> 33:21.834
- Yeah, yeah. I've been trying

33:21.835 --> 33:23.126
to call you all morning,

33:20.541 --> 33:23.126
it's really annoying.

33:23.210 --> 33:24.274
- Well, it's nice to hear

33:24.275 --> 33:25.337
your voice.

33:25.421 --> 33:26.485
-<i> So what time</i>

33:26.486 --> 33:27.548
<i>are you getting back?</i>

33:27.631 --> 33:29.800
- Yeah. I'm not sure.

33:29.884 --> 33:31.009
- Whoa. What does that mean?

33:31.093 --> 33:32.720
<i>- Well,
- Uncle Zeke isn't here yet.</i>

33:32.803 --> 33:34.284
- Ellen, tonight is the night

33:34.285 --> 33:35.765
for my office Christmas thing.

33:35.848 --> 33:39.184
- Oh! Yeah, right.

33:39.268 --> 33:40.686
- You gotta get back here

33:40.687 --> 33:42.104
for that. I want us to make

33:39.268 --> 33:42.104
a bit of an entrance.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.377
- Well, okay, but uh...

33:44.378 --> 33:45.733
I just, I can't go yet.

33:45.816 --> 33:47.193
- Can't you just drop

33:47.194 --> 33:48.569
the letters off and come home?

33:48.652 --> 33:50.112
- I'm really sorry, babe,

33:50.113 --> 33:51.572
but it doesn't work that way.

33:51.655 --> 33:52.990
The tradition is that I have to

33:52.991 --> 33:54.324
give him the letters in person.

33:54.408 --> 33:55.493
- Tradition? What is this,

33:55.494 --> 33:56.577
Fiddler on the Roof?

33:56.660 --> 33:58.016
-<i> Okay, don't be like that!</i>

33:58.017 --> 33:59.371
- It's fine. Whatever.

33:59.455 --> 34:01.039
- Look, I'm sorry,

34:01.123 --> 34:02.771
but I'm just gonna be stuck

34:02.772 --> 34:04.418
here a little bit longer.

34:04.501 --> 34:06.066
- It's fine.

34:06.067 --> 34:07.630
Karen will be there,

34:04.501 --> 34:07.630
I'll have someone to talk to.

34:07.713 --> 34:09.172
- Karen?

34:09.255 --> 34:10.424
-<i> You remember Karen</i>

34:10.425 --> 34:11.592
<i>from accounting.</i>

34:11.675 --> 34:13.427
- Karen from accounting.

34:13.428 --> 34:15.178
How could I forget?

34:15.262 --> 34:16.973
-<i> What was that?</i>

34:17.054 --> 34:19.181
- I... nothing.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.705
-<i> What did you say?</i>

34:20.706 --> 34:22.143
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

34:22.226 --> 34:23.771
- Hello? Gray? Gray!

34:27.713 --> 34:28.734
Can you do... it's not...

34:31.487 --> 34:33.112
- Hello?

34:35.908 --> 34:37.618
- Yeah, I guess the lines
- are down.

34:37.701 --> 34:39.119
Happens a lot

34:39.120 --> 34:40.536
when it gets this cold.

34:40.621 --> 34:43.916
So, Gray is your fiancé?

34:45.125 --> 34:47.628
The charitable one?

34:47.710 --> 34:49.484
- Yes, and he would like me home

34:49.485 --> 34:51.255
before the Fourth of July.

34:51.340 --> 34:53.842
Did you get a hold of Zeke?

34:53.926 --> 34:55.886
- Sorry.

34:57.262 --> 34:58.806
- Sorry?!

34:58.889 --> 35:00.808
- Sorry you didn't get
- a hold of him

35:00.891 --> 35:02.601
- Or sorry
- that you didn't even try?

35:02.685 --> 35:04.354
- Look, I told you, he doesn't

35:04.355 --> 35:06.022
have a phone up there.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.731
Now the lines are down.

35:07.815 --> 35:10.233
He will be here when he's here.

35:11.735 --> 35:13.591
- I can't stay another night.

35:13.592 --> 35:15.447
- Is it something I said?

35:18.034 --> 35:19.953
- Look, I spent most of my cash

35:19.954 --> 35:21.871
at dinner last night and...

35:21.954 --> 35:23.831
I can't afford it.

35:23.914 --> 35:25.708
- We take credit cards.

35:26.750 --> 35:28.585
- I don't have one.

35:28.669 --> 35:30.546
- Who travels
- without a credit card?

35:30.629 --> 35:32.047
- Great. I'm gonna have

35:32.048 --> 35:33.465
to call my father!

35:33.549 --> 35:35.843
- What?

35:38.971 --> 35:40.556
- Nothing. You know what?

35:40.639 --> 35:41.849
I'm gonna figure this out

35:41.850 --> 35:43.059
by myself. Thank you anyway.

35:45.352 --> 35:46.770
- Miss London.

35:46.771 --> 35:48.188
Ellie!

35:57.573 --> 35:59.366
Look, we've all been there.

36:00.076 --> 36:01.535
- Where?

36:01.618 --> 36:03.057
- Money's a little tight,

36:03.058 --> 36:04.496
you didn't expect all this.

36:04.580 --> 36:06.353
Now... I know you're not the

36:06.354 --> 36:08.125
biggest fan of charity, but...

36:08.208 --> 36:09.731
- No. I-I...

36:09.732 --> 36:11.253
- Just let me finish.

36:12.129 --> 36:14.381
- Mrs. Dawson, our housekeeper,
- is on vacation.

36:14.464 --> 36:15.882
Kelly called in sick

36:15.883 --> 36:17.300
this morning, so...

36:17.384 --> 36:19.803
- What are you asking me to do?

36:19.887 --> 36:20.951
- Do you know

36:20.952 --> 36:22.014
how to make a bed?

36:23.599 --> 36:25.642
- Yes...

36:37.071 --> 36:39.115
- Oh, mama!

36:41.825 --> 36:44.120
So... we've got no vacancies,

36:44.202 --> 36:45.475
and eight rooms to clean

36:45.476 --> 36:46.747
by 2:00.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.436
I figure if we split the job,

36:48.437 --> 36:50.042
we'll just make it.

36:50.126 --> 36:51.543
- Uh-huh.

36:51.627 --> 36:53.546
Yeah, yeah.

36:53.547 --> 36:55.464
That's good math.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.718
- Good luck.

37:03.265 --> 37:04.473
You can do this.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.378
This might take a little longer

38:58.379 --> 38:59.796
than I thought.

39:03.383 --> 39:06.262
I'm really sorry.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.617
I'm just... I'm not used

39:07.618 --> 39:08.889
to this kind of thing.

39:08.972 --> 39:11.016
- Yeah. Apparently.

39:11.100 --> 39:12.226
So...

39:12.227 --> 39:13.351
what do you do for a living?

39:13.435 --> 39:14.645
- Me?

39:14.646 --> 39:15.854
- Yeah.

39:15.938 --> 39:20.943
- Uh... uh... I... I'm...

39:23.570 --> 39:25.281
I'm a baker!

39:25.363 --> 39:28.408
- Oh! A baker.

39:28.491 --> 39:29.701
- Ellie the baker,

39:29.702 --> 39:30.911
it's what they call me.

39:30.994 --> 39:32.079
I just bake bake bake.

39:32.162 --> 39:33.956
- It's too bad
- you don't have a kitchen

39:34.039 --> 39:35.707
- Because that is where
- I really shine.

39:35.791 --> 39:37.709
- But you don't,
- you don't have a kitchen.

39:37.793 --> 39:39.836
No kitchen, so, oh well.

39:41.213 --> 39:42.839
- Actually...

39:49.596 --> 39:51.661
- Okay, we have to deliver the

39:51.662 --> 39:53.725
tea service to the inn by 4:00.

39:53.809 --> 39:55.061
So why don't you do

39:55.062 --> 39:56.312
the divinity,

39:56.394 --> 39:57.958
while I whip up the shortbread?

39:57.959 --> 39:59.522
- Okay!

39:59.606 --> 40:01.233
- But first do me a favour

40:01.234 --> 40:02.859
and separate the eggs.

40:02.943 --> 40:04.507
- Separate the eggs.

40:04.508 --> 40:06.071
Got it!

40:40.856 --> 40:42.899
- Ah!

40:56.872 --> 40:58.999
Is everything all right, Ellie?

40:59.082 --> 41:00.334
- Yes. Yes.

41:00.417 --> 41:03.003
I was just wondering...

41:03.086 --> 41:04.546
you said that you wanted me

41:04.547 --> 41:06.006
to separate the eggs,

41:06.089 --> 41:07.382
but you didn't tell me whether

41:07.383 --> 41:08.675
or not you wanted them

41:08.758 --> 41:11.303
separated by size or by weight.

41:11.387 --> 41:13.596
- You're not a baker, are you?

41:15.473 --> 41:16.892
- No.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.727
- Have you ever done
- any cooking?

41:18.810 --> 41:21.397
- I watch the Cooking Channel...

41:21.479 --> 41:24.691
sometimes. At the gym.

41:26.693 --> 41:28.611
- I should've realized
- yesterday.

41:28.695 --> 41:30.613
You look just like her.

41:30.697 --> 41:32.533
- Excuse me?

41:32.534 --> 41:34.368
- Your mom!

41:34.451 --> 41:36.245
You are the spitting

41:36.246 --> 41:38.038
image of Nora Langford.

41:39.122 --> 41:41.333
- I didn't think of that.

41:44.336 --> 41:45.629
- So why are you lying

41:45.630 --> 41:46.922
about who you are?

41:47.005 --> 41:50.633
- I'm not lying. Really.

41:50.717 --> 41:54.263
I'm doing this for my dad.

41:54.346 --> 41:55.848
See, he wanted me to come here

41:55.849 --> 41:57.349
without telling anyone who I am.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.810
- So that people wouldn't treat me
- differently.

42:00.894 --> 42:03.188
See, he wanted me

42:03.189 --> 42:05.482
to learn something

42:05.565 --> 42:07.255
from the people of Snow Falls.

42:07.256 --> 42:08.944
- Learn something?

42:09.027 --> 42:10.279
- Yeah.

42:10.362 --> 42:12.906
Please don't tell anyone.

42:17.369 --> 42:19.413
- Well, if Jim Langford

42:19.414 --> 42:21.457
thinks it's a good idea,

42:21.539 --> 42:24.293
I'm willing to help out.

42:24.376 --> 42:26.211
- Thank you.

42:30.757 --> 42:32.675
- Did you know that Jake
- was married once?

42:32.759 --> 42:34.470
- No.

42:34.552 --> 42:35.637
- To a Wall Street broker,

42:35.638 --> 42:36.721
believe it or not.

42:36.805 --> 42:38.161
They met when he was in college

42:38.162 --> 42:39.516
in New York.

42:39.599 --> 42:40.851
Got married a year later

42:40.852 --> 42:42.102
and a year after that,

42:42.185 --> 42:44.167
she left him for one of her

42:44.168 --> 42:46.148
clients. Some millionaire.

42:46.231 --> 42:49.025
- That's terrible.

42:49.109 --> 42:51.445
- It is. Broke my heart.

42:53.196 --> 42:54.448
You see I...

42:54.531 --> 42:56.783
I love my nephew

42:56.784 --> 42:59.035
like he were my own son.

43:00.412 --> 43:02.789
- And... I don't want to see him
- get hurt.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.084
- No. No, no, no.

43:06.168 --> 43:07.544
I'm... I'm not here

43:07.545 --> 43:08.920
to hurt anybody.

43:09.004 --> 43:11.631
Really, I'm just here to learn.

43:15.010 --> 43:16.512
- Well...

43:16.594 --> 43:17.992
there's only one thing

43:17.993 --> 43:19.389
we can do then.

43:19.473 --> 43:21.641
- What?

43:21.724 --> 43:22.997
- We have to teach you

43:22.998 --> 43:24.269
how to bake.

43:29.024 --> 43:31.002
<i>The weather
- forecast is calling</i>

43:31.026 --> 43:33.111
<i>For a major snowstorm tonight.</i>

43:33.195 --> 43:34.780
<i>The mayor's office is warning</i>

43:34.781 --> 43:36.365
<i>everyone to take cover</i>

43:33.195 --> 43:36.365
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

43:36.448 --> 43:38.200
<i>High winds are forecast that</i>

43:38.201 --> 43:39.951
<i>will send the windchill</i>

43:36.448 --> 43:39.951
<i>plummeting.</i>

43:40.035 --> 43:41.599
<i>So everyone is advised</i>

43:41.600 --> 43:43.163
<i>to stay inside, stay warm</i>

43:43.246 --> 43:44.873
<i>and sit out what will be</i>

43:44.874 --> 43:46.500
<i>a very cold night.</i>

43:57.469 --> 43:59.555
- Looks like your Christmas
- cookies are a big hit.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.139
- Thanks to you.

44:01.223 --> 44:03.058
- Oh, I just held your hand

44:03.059 --> 44:04.893
a bit. You did the rest.

44:06.269 --> 44:07.417
I'll have you making

44:07.418 --> 44:08.564
Baked Alaska in no time.

44:11.149 --> 44:12.984
- Where's the manager?

44:13.068 --> 44:14.757
- I'm not sure,

44:14.758 --> 44:16.446
Captain Williams.

44:13.068 --> 44:16.446
Can I help you with anything?

44:16.530 --> 44:18.781
- We're out of honey.

44:18.865 --> 44:20.846
This morning, no clotted cream.

44:20.847 --> 44:22.827
What is this place coming to?

44:22.911 --> 44:25.205
- Well, I...

44:26.812 --> 44:28.333
- Come on inside, folks!

44:29.667 --> 44:30.731
Everybody come on over

44:30.732 --> 44:31.794
to the fire and warm up.

44:31.878 --> 44:33.838
- Aunt Debbie,
- can you give me a hand?

44:36.508 --> 44:38.760
- Yes, please, come on in!

44:38.843 --> 44:40.429
Come on in!

44:40.512 --> 44:41.617
- Let's just get you folks

44:41.618 --> 44:42.722
nice and warm. Come on!

44:43.807 --> 44:44.807
Close the door!

44:44.891 --> 44:46.935
- Hey. What's going on?

44:47.018 --> 44:48.353
- The storm's knocked out

44:48.354 --> 44:49.687
the power

44:47.018 --> 44:49.687
on the east side of town.

44:49.771 --> 44:51.481
- The temperature's
- getting dangerous,

44:51.565 --> 44:53.834
- So we moved most everybody
- to the shelters for the night.

44:53.858 --> 44:55.360
But... we still needed a place

44:55.361 --> 44:56.861
for these folks till the power

44:53.858 --> 44:56.861
comes back on.

44:56.945 --> 44:58.423
<i>Hey, sheriff, we've got</i>

44:58.447 --> 44:59.635
<i>A 10-66 down</i>

44:59.636 --> 45:00.823
<i>by Old Lakeshore Road.</i>

45:00.907 --> 45:02.138
- Copy that. I've got to go.

45:02.139 --> 45:03.368
- Sure.

45:07.705 --> 45:09.040
Are you going back out there?

45:09.124 --> 45:10.125
- Yeah. I need to get

45:10.126 --> 45:11.126
more firewood.

45:11.209 --> 45:12.606
- But there's no vacancies.

45:12.607 --> 45:14.003
How are you gonna fit

45:11.209 --> 45:14.003
all these people in here?

45:14.087 --> 45:15.568
- Well, we'll figure it out.

45:15.569 --> 45:17.048
We have to.

45:17.132 --> 45:18.258
Can't leave anyone out

45:18.259 --> 45:19.384
in the cold.

45:32.355 --> 45:33.773
- Out in the cold.

45:37.569 --> 45:39.904
- Ellie! Where are you going?

45:39.988 --> 45:41.573
- I'll be back soon.

45:41.657 --> 45:42.950
- Oh, honey,

45:42.951 --> 45:44.242
it's freezing out there.

45:41.657 --> 45:44.242
- I'll be fine.

46:09.392 --> 46:10.643
- Ellie's not with you?

46:10.644 --> 46:11.894
- No, what do you mean?

46:11.978 --> 46:13.230
- I thought she went outside

46:13.231 --> 46:14.481
to help you.

46:14.564 --> 46:16.316
- She's outside?

46:16.317 --> 46:18.067
- Yeah, she was in a real rush.

46:18.151 --> 46:19.777
- Come on.

46:21.279 --> 46:22.447
It's much warmer in here.

46:22.531 --> 46:23.657
We have a fire going.

46:23.658 --> 46:24.782
It'll be great.

46:24.866 --> 46:26.743
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

46:29.621 --> 46:30.768
- Of course, yeah!

46:30.769 --> 46:31.914
Come on in.

46:31.998 --> 46:33.791
- You're more than welcome here.
- Come on.

46:33.875 --> 46:35.210
- Hi, Jake.

46:35.211 --> 46:36.545
- Hey, Baxter. Come on.

46:33.875 --> 46:36.545
Come on in.

46:36.628 --> 46:38.338
- I... I don't want to make
- no trouble.

46:38.421 --> 46:39.464
- Come on in!

46:39.465 --> 46:40.507
Come sit by the fire.

46:40.590 --> 46:41.654
Yeah! Come on.

46:41.655 --> 46:42.718
It's so cold out there.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.720
- I'll get you some hot chocolate.
- Thank you.

46:44.802 --> 46:46.402
- Why did you go out there
- by yourself?

46:46.429 --> 46:48.509
- You should've come
- to get me or told the sheriff.

46:48.557 --> 46:49.954
- Everyone was busy.

46:49.955 --> 46:51.351
- That weather out there

46:48.557 --> 46:51.351
is no joke.

46:51.434 --> 46:53.269
You are way underdressed.

46:54.812 --> 46:56.856
- You were worried about me.

46:58.441 --> 47:00.360
- No. No, I wasn't.

47:00.443 --> 47:02.362
I was worried about your

47:02.363 --> 47:04.280
clothes or lack thereof.

47:04.364 --> 47:06.199
- You were worried
- about my lack of clothes?

47:06.282 --> 47:07.950
- Yes.

47:08.034 --> 47:10.495
- Well, my clothes thank you.

47:12.830 --> 47:13.957
- That makes no sense

47:13.958 --> 47:15.083
whatsoever.

47:21.464 --> 47:23.299
That was some fast thinking.

47:23.383 --> 47:25.301
Thank you.

47:26.052 --> 47:28.304
- Well, you set a good example,
- so, thank you.

47:34.477 --> 47:37.105
- Okay. Uh, I am going to...

47:37.939 --> 47:39.566
...head over to the fire...

47:39.649 --> 47:41.443
to go make the fire.

47:41.526 --> 47:42.986
- Okay.

47:42.987 --> 47:44.446
- Bigger. Make the fire bigger.

47:47.073 --> 47:48.533
Okay.

48:14.183 --> 48:15.915
So, you folks are gonna stay

48:15.916 --> 48:17.646
in my room.

48:17.729 --> 48:18.980
I'm gonna bunk down here

48:18.981 --> 48:20.231
with Baxter.

48:20.315 --> 48:21.420
- Thank you, sir.

48:21.421 --> 48:22.525
- No problem.

48:24.319 --> 48:27.447
Now, that just leaves you guys

48:27.530 --> 48:29.095
and our mom

48:29.096 --> 48:30.659
and her two snow princesses.

48:30.742 --> 48:32.494
- My wife and I have
- the honeymoon suite.

48:32.577 --> 48:33.724
We could give up the sofa

48:33.725 --> 48:34.871
in the sitting room.

48:34.954 --> 48:36.665
- That is great. Thank you.

48:36.748 --> 48:37.999
- Jacob, I'd like to volunteer

48:38.000 --> 48:39.250
to give up my room,

48:39.334 --> 48:41.461
take the honeymooner's sofa.

48:41.544 --> 48:42.837
My hearing's not that good

48:42.838 --> 48:44.130
anymore anyway.

48:46.883 --> 48:48.093
- Thank you, Captain.

48:48.094 --> 48:49.302
Very kind of you.

48:49.385 --> 48:50.929
So, you folks will stay

48:50.930 --> 48:52.472
in the Captain's room.

48:52.555 --> 48:55.266
Now... Cara...

48:55.350 --> 48:56.852
- Ah, it's okay, Jake,

48:56.934 --> 48:59.330
- we'll just make ourselves
- comfortable down here somewhere.

48:59.354 --> 49:00.938
- Uh, excuse me.

49:01.022 --> 49:02.837
I have a couch in my room.

49:02.838 --> 49:04.651
I'd be happy to share it too.

49:04.734 --> 49:06.569
- No, no. You don't have

49:06.570 --> 49:08.404
to do that. It's okay.

49:08.488 --> 49:09.802
- I want to.

49:09.803 --> 49:11.115
It's Christmas.

49:12.575 --> 49:13.576
- Say "thank you"

49:13.577 --> 49:14.577
to the nice lady.

49:14.661 --> 49:15.829
- Thank you, nice lady.

49:15.912 --> 49:17.539
Aw...

49:24.796 --> 49:25.943
- Here we go.

49:25.944 --> 49:27.089
Come on in.

49:29.217 --> 49:31.302
- I cannot tell you
- how much we appreciate this.

49:31.386 --> 49:32.721
- Of course.

49:32.804 --> 49:34.160
- Mommy, what if Santa

49:34.161 --> 49:35.515
can't find us?

49:35.598 --> 49:37.934
- Oh, I wouldn't worry, honey.
- Santa's pretty smart.

49:38.017 --> 49:39.665
- Yeah. Besides, there's still

49:39.666 --> 49:41.312
two days to Christmas.

49:42.772 --> 49:44.315
- Okay.

49:44.399 --> 49:46.338
This would be so much easier

49:46.339 --> 49:48.277
if Dennis was here.

49:48.361 --> 49:50.112
That's my husband.

49:50.196 --> 49:51.781
He's stationed over in Germany

49:51.865 --> 49:53.967
- and we were hoping he would be
- home in time for Christmas,

49:53.991 --> 49:55.284
But...

49:55.368 --> 49:57.829
best laid plans and all that.

49:59.061 --> 50:00.206
Would you mind?

50:00.289 --> 50:01.416
- Oh, no...

50:01.417 --> 50:02.542
- Yeah, she's...

50:02.625 --> 50:04.544
- Oh, okay.
- There you go.

50:04.627 --> 50:05.962
- Oh.

50:06.045 --> 50:07.380
- Thanks.

50:18.641 --> 50:20.435
- Hey, why don't you guys
- take the bed?

50:20.518 --> 50:22.144
I can camp out on the sofa.

50:22.228 --> 50:23.625
- Oh, we can't do that.

50:23.626 --> 50:25.022
You've already been so generous.

50:25.106 --> 50:27.108
- No, it's fine.

50:27.109 --> 50:29.110
I mean, there's three of you

50:25.106 --> 50:29.110
and one of me.

50:30.027 --> 50:31.863
- Mommy, I can't find Douglas.

50:31.864 --> 50:33.698
- Who's Douglas?

50:33.782 --> 50:35.158
- My dog.

50:35.159 --> 50:36.534
- Your dog?

50:36.618 --> 50:37.682
- Her stuffed dog.

50:37.683 --> 50:38.745
Honey, are you sure?

50:38.828 --> 50:40.205
- He's not in here.

50:40.206 --> 50:41.581
Mommy, you forgot him.

50:41.664 --> 50:42.749
You know I can't sleep

50:42.750 --> 50:43.833
without Douglas.

50:45.668 --> 50:47.086
- You know what?

50:47.169 --> 50:50.172
This guy looks kind of lonely.

50:50.256 --> 50:51.695
Do you think Douglas would mind

50:51.696 --> 50:53.134
if you kept him company tonight?

51:00.683 --> 51:02.059
- Okay.

51:04.061 --> 51:06.314
- Thank you. It's cute!

51:07.273 --> 51:08.754
- Hey.

51:08.755 --> 51:10.234
- Hey!

51:10.318 --> 51:11.570
- Figured you'd need these.

51:11.571 --> 51:12.821
- Thank you.

51:12.904 --> 51:14.197
- Sure. Looks like

51:14.198 --> 51:15.490
you made a new friend.

51:15.573 --> 51:17.993
- Yeah. She likes me.

51:18.075 --> 51:20.620
I'm not sure why.

51:22.288 --> 51:23.456
- Well, let me know

51:23.457 --> 51:24.624
if you need anything else.

51:24.707 --> 51:26.021
Otherwise, good night.

51:26.022 --> 51:27.335
- Good night.

51:36.928 --> 51:38.680
He's such a nice guy.

51:40.306 --> 51:42.099
- He is, isn't he?

52:54.881 --> 52:57.967
- Hey! Uh...

53:02.013 --> 53:03.139
So...

53:03.140 --> 53:04.265
- You're an artist.

53:04.348 --> 53:06.642
- Oh, no, just a doodler.

53:09.604 --> 53:11.064
You're up late.

53:11.065 --> 53:12.523
- Yeah, I was just cleaning up.

53:12.607 --> 53:14.129
Do you need anything?

53:14.130 --> 53:15.651
- Oh, no, I'm good, thanks.

53:16.611 --> 53:18.446
- You should get some sleep
- though.

53:18.529 --> 53:21.240
- Uh, yeah, probably.

53:25.683 --> 53:27.163
Are you opening a Dollar Store?

53:27.246 --> 53:28.748
- Uh, no.

53:28.831 --> 53:30.646
No, I volunteered to help

53:30.647 --> 53:32.460
with the Santa Dinner.

53:33.836 --> 53:35.108
Those are items

53:35.109 --> 53:36.380
for the silent auction.

53:36.464 --> 53:38.299
- Long-time tradition
- around here.

53:38.382 --> 53:39.863
We're trying to raise some money

53:39.864 --> 53:41.343
for the local soup kitchen.

53:41.427 --> 53:42.929
Kind of a rough year

53:42.930 --> 53:44.430
for a lot of folks, so...

53:44.513 --> 53:46.474
- Wow.

53:50.937 --> 53:52.460
I mean, look, this alone

53:52.461 --> 53:53.982
would raise...

53:54.065 --> 53:55.650
a couple million easy.

53:57.860 --> 54:00.155
- Yeah, you can have that.

54:00.237 --> 54:01.510
There is...

54:01.511 --> 54:02.782
more where that came from.

54:02.865 --> 54:04.325
- What?!

54:04.326 --> 54:05.785
- Yeah.

54:05.868 --> 54:06.869
- Thank you.

54:06.953 --> 54:09.705
I will treasure it forever.

54:12.167 --> 54:13.168
- I just haven't had

54:13.169 --> 54:14.169
a lot of time

54:14.251 --> 54:15.854
- to bug local businesses
- for donations.

54:15.878 --> 54:17.797
Which is why I have...

54:17.880 --> 54:19.841
beautiful items like this

54:19.842 --> 54:21.801
for auction.

54:21.884 --> 54:23.011
- And when is it?

54:23.012 --> 54:24.137
- Day after tomorrow.

54:24.220 --> 54:25.847
- Ooh...

54:27.264 --> 54:30.185
- I know. Believe me. I know.

54:30.267 --> 54:31.435
It's just been a little crazy

54:31.436 --> 54:32.603
around here with the storm.

54:32.687 --> 54:34.147
- Yeah.

54:35.898 --> 54:37.274
Hey!

54:38.943 --> 54:40.716
This could actually

54:40.717 --> 54:42.488
fetch a price.

54:42.571 --> 54:43.593
That's adorable.

54:43.594 --> 54:44.615
Did you do this?

54:44.699 --> 54:45.930
- Yeah. That's just...

54:45.931 --> 54:47.160
just a sketch.

54:48.036 --> 54:49.100
- You should do something

54:49.101 --> 54:50.163
with these.

54:51.164 --> 54:53.041
Okay, you're the artist,

54:53.124 --> 54:54.229
but you should know

54:54.230 --> 54:55.334
that you're very talented.

54:56.919 --> 54:58.337
- Thank you.

55:00.297 --> 55:02.258
- Well, I'm gonna go to bed,
- so...

55:02.341 --> 55:03.592
- Okay.

55:09.306 --> 55:10.433
- Do you always do this much

55:10.434 --> 55:11.559
to help people?

55:12.935 --> 55:14.645
- Yeah. Whenever I can.

55:14.729 --> 55:16.105
You help people too...

55:16.189 --> 55:17.773
- Not like you.

55:18.816 --> 55:21.360
- Well, I think Baxter out there
- would beg to differ.

55:25.948 --> 55:28.201
- I'm really gonna go this time.
- Okay.

55:31.162 --> 55:32.580
Hold on.

55:33.748 --> 55:35.437
Uh... do you want to go

55:35.438 --> 55:37.126
for a walk?

55:38.961 --> 55:40.255
- Outside?

55:40.337 --> 55:42.506
- Yes.

55:42.590 --> 55:43.590
- Now?

55:43.632 --> 55:45.760
- Yes.

55:45.843 --> 55:47.303
- Why?

55:47.386 --> 55:49.805
- I want to show you something?

55:53.559 --> 55:55.811
- Uh... Okay.

55:58.189 --> 56:00.066
Can I...

56:00.149 --> 56:01.880
- Yes?

56:01.881 --> 56:03.611
- ...borrow a warmer coat?

56:04.570 --> 56:05.905
You're right, I do have a lack

56:05.906 --> 56:07.240
of clothes problem.

56:08.074 --> 56:09.325
I think you're really good

56:09.326 --> 56:10.576
at what you do

56:10.659 --> 56:13.121
and you're a talented artist.

56:13.204 --> 56:14.914
I think if you just made a few

56:14.915 --> 56:16.624
big, bold moves, you could...

56:17.583 --> 56:19.294
do so much more.

56:19.376 --> 56:21.003
- Yeah, well, sometimes,

56:21.004 --> 56:22.630
big, bold moves...

56:23.798 --> 56:25.571
don't work out so great.

56:25.572 --> 56:27.343
- Right. New York.

56:29.011 --> 56:30.679
- What do you mean, New York?

56:30.763 --> 56:32.431
- I...

56:33.933 --> 56:35.977
- Aunt Debbie.

56:36.060 --> 56:37.687
- We had to talk about something

56:37.688 --> 56:39.314
while the cookies were baking.

56:44.277 --> 56:46.008
- I guess I'm an idiot.

56:46.009 --> 56:47.738
I never suspected anything.

56:47.822 --> 56:50.532
We were in different worlds;

56:51.408 --> 56:53.161
she worked in finance,

56:53.244 --> 56:54.391
I was a... struggling

56:54.392 --> 56:55.537
art student.

56:55.621 --> 56:58.291
But... true love, right?

57:00.042 --> 57:01.502
I don't know. I really thought

57:01.503 --> 57:02.962
she was the one.

57:04.755 --> 57:05.965
So, we're having

57:05.966 --> 57:07.175
this romantic dinner

57:07.258 --> 57:09.969
and out of nowhere,

57:10.052 --> 57:11.220
in the middle

57:11.221 --> 57:12.388
of the seafood risotto,

57:12.471 --> 57:13.827
she looks at me

57:13.828 --> 57:15.183
and she just says:

57:15.266 --> 57:16.892
"It's over."

57:17.434 --> 57:19.186
Bam! Right then, they start

57:19.187 --> 57:20.938
playing Silent Night.

57:22.273 --> 57:23.462
- So now, every time the song

57:23.463 --> 57:24.650
comes on, you...

57:24.733 --> 57:26.194
- Yeah.
- It's pretty stupid, right?

57:26.277 --> 57:27.507
You'd think I'd be able

57:27.508 --> 57:28.737
to get over it by now.

57:28.821 --> 57:31.199
- I don't know.

57:31.282 --> 57:33.222
I think some things

57:33.223 --> 57:35.161
you never actually get over.

57:40.082 --> 57:42.377
You wanted to show me something?

57:42.459 --> 57:44.295
- Yeah. We're almost there.

57:44.379 --> 57:46.214
It's right that way.

57:46.297 --> 57:47.923
- Okay.

57:56.473 --> 57:57.933
Wow!

58:09.695 --> 58:11.572
You made these?

58:11.573 --> 58:13.449
- I just designed them.

58:13.532 --> 58:14.784
My buddy Martin teaches

58:14.785 --> 58:16.035
sculpture at the college, so,

58:16.118 --> 58:17.432
his students actually do

58:17.433 --> 58:18.746
all the hard work.

58:20.122 --> 58:21.249
- They're stunning.

58:21.250 --> 58:22.375
- Thanks.

58:23.959 --> 58:25.252
They're a big hit

58:25.253 --> 58:26.545
with the tourists

58:23.959 --> 58:26.545
that come around Christmas.

58:26.628 --> 58:27.922
- Well, they're a big hit

58:27.923 --> 58:29.215
with this tourist.

58:30.716 --> 58:32.385
So is the artist.

58:34.345 --> 58:35.868
- Well... the tourist isn't

58:35.869 --> 58:37.390
so bad herself.

58:47.942 --> 58:50.445
- When I was a teenager,

58:50.527 --> 58:52.571
my mom died.

58:54.156 --> 58:56.200
That's a thing I can't get over.

58:58.953 --> 59:00.475
- I am so sorry.

59:00.476 --> 59:01.997
- Thanks.

59:04.375 --> 59:06.231
She came from

59:06.232 --> 59:08.087
a beautiful little town,

59:08.170 --> 59:10.214
just like this one.

59:11.548 --> 59:12.883
And I could never bring myself

59:12.884 --> 59:14.218
to go back.

59:15.386 --> 59:17.430
Just... scared.

59:19.556 --> 59:21.683
Once she was gone, I just...

59:21.767 --> 59:23.310
I started living life

59:23.311 --> 59:24.853
as if nothing else mattered

59:25.980 --> 59:28.023
because... at the time,

59:29.191 --> 59:31.402
the way I felt, nothing did.

59:34.571 --> 59:36.240
But these past few days,

59:37.992 --> 59:39.827
you...

59:41.787 --> 59:43.810
You've taught me that

59:43.811 --> 59:45.833
some things really do matter.

59:56.218 --> 59:57.699
- Is this the part

59:57.700 --> 59:59.180
where we're supposed to kiss?

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:02.099
- I think so.

01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:08.856
I can't!

01:00:10.358 --> 01:00:13.152
I... I'm sorry.

01:00:13.235 --> 01:00:14.529
- Oh!

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:15.779
Yeah, no, no. I am so sorry.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:16.947
I'm so sorry.

01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:18.157
Oh, you were talking about

01:00:18.158 --> 01:00:19.283
your mom and I didn't...

01:00:19.367 --> 01:00:20.993
I don't...

01:00:20.994 --> 01:00:22.619
- You're such a nice guy.

01:00:22.703 --> 01:00:24.163
- Not that nice...

01:00:24.246 --> 01:00:26.446
- I dragged you up here to look
- at a bunch of nothing.

01:00:26.499 --> 01:00:28.543
- No! No. Not nothing.

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.169
Not nothing.

01:00:30.252 --> 01:00:31.962
It's lovely

01:00:32.046 --> 01:00:33.881
- and so is your company...
- and...

01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:36.884
I should go.

01:00:38.344 --> 01:00:40.095
Good night, Jake.

01:00:41.055 --> 01:00:42.682
- Going the wrong way.

01:00:42.683 --> 01:00:44.308
- Yep, yep. Got it.

01:01:35.131 --> 01:01:36.151
What are you doing?

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.336
- Good morning, Ellie.

01:02:35.419 --> 01:02:37.254
- Are you ready
- for today's lesson?

01:02:37.338 --> 01:02:39.632
- Actually, I need a favour.

01:02:39.715 --> 01:02:41.634
- Oh...

01:02:57.774 --> 01:02:59.109
Whoa! That's good!

01:02:59.110 --> 01:03:00.444
- Okay.

01:03:44.238 --> 01:03:45.823
- Don't forget about Mr. Martin

01:03:45.824 --> 01:03:47.408
at the art gallery

01:03:44.238 --> 01:03:47.408
and tell him I sent you.

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:49.159
- I will.

01:03:49.243 --> 01:03:50.911
Thank you.

01:03:52.663 --> 01:03:53.685
- Keys.

01:03:53.686 --> 01:03:54.707
- Oh, yes!

01:03:52.663 --> 01:03:54.707
- Good luck!

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:55.267
- A silent auction?

01:04:55.268 --> 01:04:56.644
- Uh-huh. For the Santa Dinner.

01:04:56.727 --> 01:04:58.187
- I already donate online.

01:04:58.188 --> 01:04:59.647
- But it's for local charity.

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:00.919
Every dollar from the auction

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.107
goes to help your friends

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:03.960
- and neighbours,
- right here, in Snow Falls.

01:05:03.984 --> 01:05:05.590
- I already pay my taxes.

01:05:05.591 --> 01:05:07.195
And plenty of 'em.

01:05:07.279 --> 01:05:08.614
- Come on! It's Christmas.

01:05:08.697 --> 01:05:10.907
- Sorry, Miss, that just doesn't
- cut it with me.

01:05:10.991 --> 01:05:13.952
- Please? You get cookies!

01:05:14.035 --> 01:05:15.795
- You're gonna have
- to do better than that.

01:05:16.747 --> 01:05:18.791
- It's the right thing to do.

01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:52.199
Okay then!

01:06:11.593 --> 01:06:12.803
- Well, they'll have the power

01:06:12.804 --> 01:06:14.012
back up for those folks

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:15.723
by tomorrow morning.

01:06:15.806 --> 01:06:18.016
- Thanks for all your help, Jake.
- My pleasure.

01:06:28.402 --> 01:06:29.862
- Hi!

01:06:30.612 --> 01:06:33.866
- Hi. What is all this?

01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:38.683
- This is your Dinner with Santa

01:06:38.684 --> 01:06:40.539
silent auction.

01:06:40.622 --> 01:06:41.853
Every item was donated

01:06:41.854 --> 01:06:43.083
by local merchants

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:44.919
right here, in Snow Falls.

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:47.755
- Oh! You're kidding!

01:06:47.838 --> 01:06:49.089
You did all this?

01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:50.340
- Uh-huh.

01:06:50.424 --> 01:06:52.133
- How?

01:06:52.217 --> 01:06:53.677
- Well, you don't spend

01:06:53.678 --> 01:06:55.136
this long in the gift...

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.784
baking business without

01:06:56.785 --> 01:06:58.348
picking up a trick or two.

01:06:58.432 --> 01:06:59.975
- Gift-baking business?

01:07:00.058 --> 01:07:01.769
- Jake, you ever heard
- the expression:

01:07:01.852 --> 01:07:03.771
- "Don't look a gift-horse
- in the mouth"?

01:07:05.313 --> 01:07:08.943
I don't know what to say!

01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:10.298
- Seems like "thank you"

01:07:10.299 --> 01:07:11.528
wouldn't be out of place.

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:14.531
- Thank you.

01:07:37.679 --> 01:07:38.889
- Man, this really is

01:07:38.890 --> 01:07:40.098
a friendly little town.

01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:42.225
- Gray?

01:07:44.895 --> 01:07:47.648
G-Gray! What are you doing here?

01:07:47.731 --> 01:07:49.608
- Well, uh...
- I heard about the storm,

01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:51.089
So I figured I'd come up here

01:07:51.090 --> 01:07:52.486
and rescue you.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:54.280
Although it looks like you're

01:07:54.281 --> 01:07:55.990
doing just fine without me.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:57.219
- I thought the roads

01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:58.366
were closed.

01:07:58.450 --> 01:08:00.160
- I guess they're open now.

01:08:00.243 --> 01:08:02.203
- Yeah, they're open now.

01:08:02.287 --> 01:08:05.040
- Gray, this is Jake Collins.

01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:06.187
He manages the inn

01:08:06.188 --> 01:08:07.250
and Jake,

01:08:07.334 --> 01:08:08.586
this is Gray Pittman,

01:08:08.587 --> 01:08:09.837
my fiancé.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.567
- Good to meet you.

01:08:11.568 --> 01:08:13.214
- Yeah. Same to you.

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:14.758
- Paul Greenleaf. I'm the

01:08:14.759 --> 01:08:16.216
sheriff here in Snow Falls.

01:08:16.301 --> 01:08:17.407
You need anything,

01:08:17.408 --> 01:08:18.511
don't hesitate to call.

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:20.095
- Well, thank you, Paul,

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.500
- but I'm pretty good at taking
- care of things on my own.

01:08:25.519 --> 01:08:26.791
- Uh... come on, honey,

01:08:26.792 --> 01:08:28.063
do you want to see the inn?

01:08:25.519 --> 01:08:28.063
It's beautiful.

01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:29.502
- Yeah, I'd love to.

01:08:29.502 --> 01:08:30.858
- Okay.

01:08:30.941 --> 01:08:32.567
- Nice to meet y'all.

01:08:38.323 --> 01:08:40.075
- Seems like a nice fella.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:49.001
- You didn't have

01:08:49.002 --> 01:08:50.044
to be so rude out there.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:51.189
- Oh, well, excuse me,

01:08:51.191 --> 01:08:52.252
I'll try to be more polite

01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:53.505
next time some guy

01:08:53.506 --> 01:08:54.673
is all over my fiancée.

01:08:54.756 --> 01:08:56.383
- He was thanking me.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:58.072
I bailed him out, helped with

01:08:58.073 --> 01:08:59.678
a charity auction, that's all.

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:01.011
- Look, I thought you

01:09:01.013 --> 01:09:02.263
came here to deliver these

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:02.263
Christmas letters

01:09:02.346 --> 01:09:04.200
- and now, you're what,
- Mother Teresa of Snow Falls?

01:09:04.224 --> 01:09:05.455
Come on, let's get you packed

01:09:05.456 --> 01:09:06.685
and get you out of here.

01:09:06.768 --> 01:09:08.310
- I can't leave yet.

01:09:08.395 --> 01:09:09.542
Uncle Zeke still

01:09:09.542 --> 01:09:10.689
hasn't shown up.

01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:12.023
- Uncle Zeke. Is this that

01:09:12.024 --> 01:09:13.274
tradition thing again?

01:09:13.358 --> 01:09:15.484
- What about us?
- What about our new traditions?

01:09:15.569 --> 01:09:17.487
We've got a flight in 24 hours.

01:09:17.571 --> 01:09:18.988
- Okay, look,

01:09:19.073 --> 01:09:21.450
if Zeke doesn't show up by

01:09:21.451 --> 01:09:23.827
tomorrow morning,

01:09:23.911 --> 01:09:25.370
we'll go, alright?

01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:26.768
I'll leave the letters

01:09:26.769 --> 01:09:28.082
at the front desk and...

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:30.283
- figure out a way to explain it
- to my father later.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.376
- Okay, great.

01:09:31.377 --> 01:09:32.419
What do I do until then?

01:09:33.795 --> 01:09:35.401
- Well, you've been on the road

01:09:35.402 --> 01:09:37.006
all day, you must be exhausted.

01:09:37.091 --> 01:09:38.404
So, why don't you go in there,

01:09:38.406 --> 01:09:39.718
take a nap,

01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:41.448
and I'll be back after I help

01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:43.096
Debbie with the Christmas tea.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:44.848
- Okay.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.078
- Oh! And remember,

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:48.518
I'm not Ellen Langford here.

01:09:48.602 --> 01:09:50.353
I'm just plain old Ellie London.

01:09:50.437 --> 01:09:51.689
- Ellie London?

01:09:51.689 --> 01:09:52.939
- Ellie London.

01:09:53.023 --> 01:09:54.170
- Okay.

01:09:54.171 --> 01:09:55.316
- Great. Bye.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.235
- You got it.

01:10:00.822 --> 01:10:02.741
Wait, Christmas tea?

01:10:16.838 --> 01:10:18.256
- Can I help you?

01:11:05.679 --> 01:11:07.181
- Hey.

01:11:07.182 --> 01:11:08.682
- Hey!

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:11.476
- Uh, Debbie asked me to...

01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:13.520
pick up the car so I can...

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:15.939
- Christmas tea. Yes.

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:18.295
- Thank you.

01:11:18.296 --> 01:11:19.317
- Sure.

01:11:21.486 --> 01:11:23.404
- I'm sorry about Gray.

01:11:23.488 --> 01:11:25.052
He doesn't mean to be rude,

01:11:25.053 --> 01:11:26.616
it's just kind of the way

01:11:23.488 --> 01:11:26.616
that he is.

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.243
- Yeah, hey,
- don't worry about it.

01:11:28.326 --> 01:11:29.348
I probably would've acted

01:11:29.349 --> 01:11:30.370
the same way, so...

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:32.747
- I don't think you would've.

01:11:37.919 --> 01:11:39.337
- Look, uh...

01:11:41.715 --> 01:11:44.634
About last night,

01:11:44.718 --> 01:11:47.054
um, I wanted to apologize.

01:11:47.137 --> 01:11:49.056
I knew you were engaged

01:11:49.139 --> 01:11:50.891
- and I never should've
- let that happen.

01:11:52.517 --> 01:11:53.790
- Well, there were two of us

01:11:53.791 --> 01:11:55.062
out there.

01:11:55.145 --> 01:11:57.438
- Yeah, but you've been up front
- with me from the start

01:11:57.522 --> 01:11:59.524
And I should've respected that.

01:12:00.942 --> 01:12:02.193
The... the thing is...

01:12:02.194 --> 01:12:03.444
- Jake.

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:06.198
- Just hear me out on this.

01:12:06.865 --> 01:12:08.471
The thing is it's been

01:12:08.472 --> 01:12:10.077
a long time since I've felt

01:12:06.865 --> 01:12:10.077
like I could trust anyone.

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:13.267
And... I don't know,

01:12:13.268 --> 01:12:15.207
you're different. You're honest.

01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:17.105
And it was just nice to feel

01:12:17.106 --> 01:12:18.252
that way again,

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:20.065
but I let my feelings get

01:12:20.066 --> 01:12:21.796
the best of me and I'm sorry.

01:12:25.759 --> 01:12:28.011
So... friends?

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:31.577
Let's high-five.

01:12:31.578 --> 01:12:32.807
Okay, let's be friends.

01:12:36.186 --> 01:12:38.042
- Hey, I... I've got

01:12:38.043 --> 01:12:39.898
to tell you something.

01:12:39.981 --> 01:12:41.900
- Jake!

01:12:41.983 --> 01:12:43.818
- Oh, I will be right back.

01:12:45.987 --> 01:12:47.281
What's going on?

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:49.094
I've got it.

01:12:49.095 --> 01:12:50.825
- Okay. Alright.

01:12:52.786 --> 01:12:55.122
I thought elves were union.

01:12:55.205 --> 01:12:56.477
Trying to get worker's comp

01:12:56.478 --> 01:12:57.749
out of this or what?

01:12:58.374 --> 01:12:59.480
Trying to make a little

01:12:59.481 --> 01:13:00.585
money off the church?

01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:03.546
I take my eyes off you

01:13:03.547 --> 01:13:04.714
for two seconds!

01:13:04.798 --> 01:13:07.092
I'm kidding, I'm kidding!

01:13:07.175 --> 01:13:09.303
Alright, you okay?

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:11.512
You alright? Okay.

01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:13.265
Whoa.

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:34.119
- Ah!

01:13:46.256 --> 01:13:48.133
- I come from a family
- of pastry chefs

01:13:48.216 --> 01:13:49.759
And can I just say,

01:13:49.843 --> 01:13:51.157
these are truly the most

01:13:51.158 --> 01:13:52.470
delicious Christmas cookies

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:54.389
I've ever tasted.

01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:56.224
- Really?! Thank you.

01:13:58.852 --> 01:14:00.645
- Bon appétit.
- Thank you.

01:14:02.356 --> 01:14:03.461
- Hi!

01:14:03.462 --> 01:14:04.565
- Are we in the Stone Age?

01:14:04.649 --> 01:14:06.401
- I can't get a signal
- to save my life.

01:14:06.526 --> 01:14:08.569
- Well, do you want a cookie
- to cheer you up?

01:14:08.653 --> 01:14:10.238
- You know I don't do sugar.

01:14:10.322 --> 01:14:12.073
- I made them myself.

01:14:12.157 --> 01:14:14.784
- You made these? Seriously?

01:14:14.868 --> 01:14:16.411
- Is that so hard to believe?

01:14:16.494 --> 01:14:17.746
- Well... it's a long way

01:14:17.747 --> 01:14:18.997
from the Party Heiress

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.748
to Suzy Homemaker.

01:14:21.666 --> 01:14:23.043
- Can you please cut it out

01:14:23.044 --> 01:14:24.419
with the party heiress stuff?

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:26.629
Nobody knows who I am here.

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:28.756
- What's with the waitress bit?

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.218
- Well, I ran out of money,

01:14:31.301 --> 01:14:33.053
so I've been helping out

01:14:33.054 --> 01:14:34.804
around here to earn my keep.

01:14:34.888 --> 01:14:36.285
- Why didn't you just call me

01:14:36.286 --> 01:14:37.682
or call your father?

01:14:37.765 --> 01:14:38.996
- Because I said that I was

01:14:38.997 --> 01:14:40.227
gonna do this on my own

01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:42.020
and I meant it.

01:14:42.103 --> 01:14:43.730
No one knows who I am,

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:45.377
they treat me like a regular

01:14:45.378 --> 01:14:46.941
person. And I like that.

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:51.154
- You're starting to scare me.

01:14:54.324 --> 01:14:55.742
Thank you!

01:14:56.117 --> 01:14:57.493
- What do you think?

01:14:57.577 --> 01:14:59.829
- I think...

01:15:01.331 --> 01:15:02.520
You can play all lovey-dovey

01:15:02.521 --> 01:15:03.708
with the locals all you want,

01:15:03.791 --> 01:15:06.253
but trust me,

01:15:06.336 --> 01:15:07.650
you're never gonna be

01:15:07.651 --> 01:15:08.963
one of them.

01:15:10.131 --> 01:15:11.591

01:19:17.962 --> 01:19:21.007
the Christmas hoo-ha?

01:19:22.967 --> 01:19:25.074
- Sometimes you just need

01:19:25.075 --> 01:19:27.180
a break, even from Christmas.

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:29.015
- Tell me about it.

01:19:31.392 --> 01:19:32.414
My family wasn't much

01:19:32.415 --> 01:19:33.436
for tradition.

01:19:35.188 --> 01:19:36.919
More of the... buy the next

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.650
shiny new thing crowd.

01:19:41.194 --> 01:19:42.820
- Right.

01:19:44.197 --> 01:19:46.324
- I gotta hand it to you.

01:19:46.407 --> 01:19:48.760
- Never in a million years did
- I think I'd see Ellen Langford

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.453
Making Christmas cookies.

01:19:50.995 --> 01:19:52.747
- I thought she was a baker.

01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:54.144
- A baker!

01:19:57.210 --> 01:20:00.463
Yeah... you're kidding, right?

01:20:01.631 --> 01:20:03.466
- Wait, Ellen Langford?

01:20:05.009 --> 01:20:06.553
As in Jim Langford.

01:20:08.722 --> 01:20:10.449
- As in Jim Langford
- of Home & Hearth Gifts?

01:20:10.473 --> 01:20:12.851
- Do me a favour,

01:20:12.852 --> 01:20:15.228
forget I said anything, alright?

01:20:18.022 --> 01:20:19.044
- Yeah, yeah.

01:20:19.045 --> 01:20:20.066
Yeah, sure.

01:20:35.665 --> 01:20:37.500
- Merry Christmas.

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.302
Ellen Langford.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:33.013
Fooled again.

01:21:50.531 --> 01:21:53.242
- Well, I guess this is goodbye.

01:21:53.326 --> 01:21:55.453
- I'm sad you're leaving.

01:21:55.536 --> 01:21:57.101
- I don't even know

01:21:57.102 --> 01:21:58.665
how to start to thank you

01:21:55.536 --> 01:21:58.665
for everything you've done.

01:21:58.748 --> 01:22:00.249
- You already did.

01:22:00.333 --> 01:22:01.814
You guys kept me company

01:22:01.815 --> 01:22:03.294
through a scary storm.

01:22:03.377 --> 01:22:05.254
Now, there is someone

01:22:05.255 --> 01:22:07.131
who wants to come home with you.

01:22:09.133 --> 01:22:10.468
- What do you say, Livvy?

01:22:10.551 --> 01:22:12.116
- Thank you. Now,

01:22:12.117 --> 01:22:13.680
I'm sorry, but we have to go.

01:22:13.763 --> 01:22:15.035
Santa comes tonight

01:22:15.036 --> 01:22:16.307
and we cannot be late.

01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:17.892
- Oh, of course!

01:22:17.893 --> 01:22:19.393
Merry Christmas.

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:23.960
- Thank you.

01:22:23.961 --> 01:22:24.982
- Bye.

01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:31.719
- Get the door, Livvy.

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:32.866
Thanks!

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:34.868
- I'm gonna go take this out
- to the car

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.703
- If my back
- doesn't give out first.

01:22:36.786 --> 01:22:38.100
Hopefully, there'll be better

01:22:38.101 --> 01:22:39.413
bellboys in Maui, huh, babe?

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:52.301
- On your way?

01:22:52.302 --> 01:22:53.636
- I guess so.

01:22:55.388 --> 01:22:57.306
Did you hear from Zeke?

01:22:57.390 --> 01:22:59.099
Phone call? Anything?

01:22:59.183 --> 01:23:01.227
- Sorry, nothing.

01:23:02.812 --> 01:23:05.022
- Okay. Uh, well...

01:23:08.609 --> 01:23:10.236
If you could just give him this

01:23:10.237 --> 01:23:11.863
when you see him.

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:16.033
- Yeah, I can't, sorry.

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:19.787
- What? Why?

01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:22.916
- It's like the sign says:

01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:24.333
"Management will not be

01:23:24.334 --> 01:23:25.668
responsible for valuables."

01:23:25.752 --> 01:23:28.128
And to the people in this town,

01:23:28.212 --> 01:23:29.547
these Christmas letters

01:23:29.548 --> 01:23:30.882
are pretty damn valuable.

01:23:31.632 --> 01:23:33.551
Here's your bill.

01:23:33.634 --> 01:23:34.990
Now, is your fiancé gonna pay

01:23:34.991 --> 01:23:36.345
for this

01:23:36.429 --> 01:23:38.056
or should I just send

01:23:38.057 --> 01:23:39.682
an invoice directly to

01:23:36.429 --> 01:23:39.682
Home & Hearth Gifts?

01:23:44.228 --> 01:23:45.292
- You know.

01:23:45.293 --> 01:23:46.355
- Yeah.

01:23:46.439 --> 01:23:48.003
We may not have cell service

01:23:48.004 --> 01:23:49.567
here, but we do have

01:23:46.439 --> 01:23:49.567
the Internet.

01:23:49.650 --> 01:23:51.215
Looked like that tree

01:23:51.216 --> 01:23:52.779
put up quite a fight.

01:23:52.862 --> 01:23:54.447
- Jake...

01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:56.592
- Hey, you know, let's just
- forget this whole thing, huh?

01:23:56.616 --> 01:23:57.784
We ought to be honoured that

01:23:57.785 --> 01:23:58.952
New York City's Party Heiress

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:00.954
- decided to stay
- at our little inn.

01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:02.497
- Jake, I never wanted

01:24:02.498 --> 01:24:03.957
to lie to you.

01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:05.854
I just couldn't tell anyone.

01:24:05.855 --> 01:24:07.668
Please, you have to understand.

01:24:07.752 --> 01:24:09.921
- Oh, yeah, no, I understand.
- Totally.

01:24:11.255 --> 01:24:12.924
You know, this is why I left

01:24:12.925 --> 01:24:14.592
New York.

01:24:14.675 --> 01:24:16.719
Because of people like you.

01:24:20.473 --> 01:24:21.495
Merry Christmas,

01:24:21.496 --> 01:24:22.516
Ms. Langford.

01:24:56.175 --> 01:24:58.094
- Ellie! Leaving already?

01:24:58.095 --> 01:25:00.013
But it's Christmas Eve!

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:01.263
- I know, but we have

01:25:01.264 --> 01:25:02.431
to get back to the city.

01:25:02.515 --> 01:25:04.308
- That's too bad.

01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:05.622
I was hoping you'd come

01:25:05.623 --> 01:25:06.853
to the Santa Dinner.

01:25:06.936 --> 01:25:08.855
I know that...

01:25:08.938 --> 01:25:10.648
Jake was really looking forward

01:25:10.649 --> 01:25:12.358
to having you there too.

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:14.735
- Yeah, well... thank you

01:25:14.736 --> 01:25:16.362
for everything.

01:25:21.325 --> 01:25:23.786
- Oh! I got you something.

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:25.642
- You didn't have to do that.

01:25:25.643 --> 01:25:27.164
- Your very own oven mitts.

01:25:28.749 --> 01:25:30.250
- Debbie...

01:25:30.334 --> 01:25:33.796
Thank you. I... I love them.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.256
- Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:37.842
Don't be a stranger.

01:25:37.843 --> 01:25:39.343
- Merry Christmas.

01:25:39.426 --> 01:25:41.053
- Oh and, um... tell your dad

01:25:41.054 --> 01:25:42.680
I said "hello" too.

01:25:42.763 --> 01:25:44.703
- I will. Thank you

01:25:44.704 --> 01:25:46.642
for keeping my secret.

01:25:46.726 --> 01:25:48.686
- I told you I would.

01:25:48.687 --> 01:25:50.646
Just remember...

01:25:51.731 --> 01:25:53.066
some secrets are too big

01:25:53.067 --> 01:25:54.400
a burden to keep.

01:25:58.988 --> 01:26:01.407
- Okay. Gotta go.

01:26:03.993 --> 01:26:05.619
Bye.

01:26:24.388 --> 01:26:26.432
- Hello? Jake?

01:27:01.425 --> 01:27:03.177
Want to talk about it?

01:27:16.857 --> 01:27:18.567
- We're cutting it
- kind of close,

01:27:18.651 --> 01:27:20.963
- But we should have just enough
- time to throw some things

01:27:20.987 --> 01:27:22.072
In a bag

01:27:22.073 --> 01:27:23.156
and race to the airport.

01:27:20.987 --> 01:27:23.156
- It's not here.

01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:24.991
- What?

01:27:25.074 --> 01:27:26.618
- The letter. I have all the

01:27:26.619 --> 01:27:28.161
letters dating back to 1981,

01:27:25.074 --> 01:27:28.161
but...

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:29.390
but I don't have the one

01:27:29.391 --> 01:27:30.537
from this year!

01:27:30.621 --> 01:27:32.623
- Maybe he didn't write one.
- He must have.

01:27:32.706 --> 01:27:34.375
That was the whole point of me

01:27:34.376 --> 01:27:36.043
going to Snow Falls, so that...

01:27:36.127 --> 01:27:37.295
so that I would

01:27:37.296 --> 01:27:38.462
hand deliver the letter. I...

01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:40.985
And now, I was planning

01:27:40.986 --> 01:27:43.425
to courier it to him

01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:43.425
from the airport. I...

01:27:43.509 --> 01:27:45.594
I must've left it at the inn.

01:27:45.678 --> 01:27:47.596
We have to go back.

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:48.806
- Are you kidding?

01:27:48.807 --> 01:27:49.932
We'll miss the flight!

01:27:50.016 --> 01:27:51.309
- Gray, I have to get

01:27:51.310 --> 01:27:52.601
that letter.

01:27:50.016 --> 01:27:52.601
- You know what,

01:27:52.685 --> 01:27:54.750
I've been pretty patient this

01:27:54.751 --> 01:27:56.814
whole time, but enough's enough.

01:27:56.897 --> 01:27:58.107
They're just a bunch

01:27:58.108 --> 01:27:59.316
of stupid letters. Who cares?

01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:01.861
- You don't mean that.

01:28:01.944 --> 01:28:03.071
- Yeah! As a matter of fact,

01:28:03.072 --> 01:28:04.197
I do.

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:05.552
I'm sick and tired of your

01:28:05.553 --> 01:28:06.824
father's neurotic cutesy

01:28:06.907 --> 01:28:08.617
family business traditions.

01:28:08.701 --> 01:28:10.119
Now, can we please just drop it

01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:11.537
and enjoy our vacation, please!

01:28:15.916 --> 01:28:18.460
Great, we need gas.

01:28:18.544 --> 01:28:19.837
Voice command.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:21.588
<i>Speak a command.</i>

01:28:21.672 --> 01:28:23.423
- Find gas station.

01:28:23.507 --> 01:28:25.634
<i> Finding gas station.</i>

01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:57.708
Look, if your boyfriend

01:28:57.709 --> 01:28:58.876
back there

01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:58.876
finds your letter at the hotel,

01:28:58.959 --> 01:28:59.981
he'll just send it

01:28:59.982 --> 01:29:01.003
to your office, right?

01:29:01.087 --> 01:29:02.338
He knows how important it is

01:29:02.339 --> 01:29:03.589
to you, to your father,

01:29:01.087 --> 01:29:03.589
the company.

01:29:03.672 --> 01:29:05.570
That whole village

01:29:05.571 --> 01:29:07.467
is built around the

01:29:03.672 --> 01:29:07.467
Home & Hearth Gifts legacy.

01:29:07.551 --> 01:29:09.178
- What makes you think

01:29:09.179 --> 01:29:10.804
he'd know who my father is?

01:29:13.766 --> 01:29:15.518
How did he know who I am?

01:29:15.519 --> 01:29:17.270
- Maybe I let it slip out

01:29:13.766 --> 01:29:17.270
last night.

01:29:18.562 --> 01:29:19.730
- Why would you do that?

01:29:19.731 --> 01:29:20.898
- It was a mistake.

01:29:20.981 --> 01:29:23.334
- He was gonna find out sooner
- or later. What's the big deal?

01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:25.069
- Who cares
- what those people think?

01:29:25.152 --> 01:29:27.487
- I care!

01:29:27.571 --> 01:29:28.906
Me!

01:29:28.989 --> 01:29:30.909
- That's the whole reason
- I went to Snow Falls,

01:29:30.991 --> 01:29:32.701
It was to learn from them!

01:29:32.785 --> 01:29:34.161
- Oh, please...

01:29:34.162 --> 01:29:35.537
what are you gonna learn

01:29:32.785 --> 01:29:35.537
from a bunch of hicks?

01:29:38.207 --> 01:29:39.708
Look, baby...

01:29:39.792 --> 01:29:41.314
You don't belong there

01:29:41.315 --> 01:29:42.836
and you know it.

01:29:44.213 --> 01:29:45.839
- Maybe I don't.

01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:51.137
But I know

01:29:51.138 --> 01:29:52.263
I don't belong with you.

01:29:59.394 --> 01:30:01.154
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Where are you going?

01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:02.648
- Back to Snow Falls.

01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:03.732
- And how do you plan

01:30:03.733 --> 01:30:04.733
on getting there?

01:30:04.817 --> 01:30:07.320
- I think I'll take the bus.

01:30:09.029 --> 01:30:10.572
- What about Maui?

01:30:11.824 --> 01:30:13.951
- You should go by yourself,

01:30:14.034 --> 01:30:15.056
I'm sure you'll enjoy

01:30:15.057 --> 01:30:16.078
the company.

- Merry Christmas, everybody!

01:31:13.093 --> 01:31:15.242
Okay, so, we're actually going

01:31:15.243 --> 01:31:17.390
to take a little bit of a break

01:31:17.472 --> 01:31:18.745
to let you all enjoy some food

01:31:18.746 --> 01:31:20.017
and fun.

01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:22.102
And a visit with Santa.

01:31:27.107 --> 01:31:29.235
- But then, right after that,
- we will be back

01:31:29.318 --> 01:31:31.820
- With a very special guest, okay?
- Thank you.

01:31:31.904 --> 01:31:33.259
Oh, wait! Hey, look,

01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:34.614
it's the big man himself!

01:31:34.698 --> 01:31:36.346
- Ho! Ho! Ho!

01:31:36.347 --> 01:31:37.993
Merry Christmas everyone!

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:00.974
- Jake...

01:32:03.352 --> 01:32:05.104
Look, I know that you have

01:32:05.105 --> 01:32:06.855
no reason to help me,

01:32:06.939 --> 01:32:09.192
but I lost one of the Christmas

01:32:09.193 --> 01:32:11.444
letters at the inn.

01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:13.028
Have you seen it?

01:32:13.112 --> 01:32:14.593
- Sorry, no.

01:32:14.594 --> 01:32:16.073
- Are you sure?

01:32:16.156 --> 01:32:17.866
- Yep.

01:32:20.535 --> 01:32:22.016
Where's your fiancé?

01:32:22.017 --> 01:32:23.497
Out in the car?

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:25.437
Not wanting to mingle

01:32:25.438 --> 01:32:27.293
with the common folk?

01:32:27.376 --> 01:32:28.648
- He's probably

01:32:28.649 --> 01:32:29.920
back in the city by now.

01:32:30.003 --> 01:32:31.735
I don't know

01:32:31.736 --> 01:32:33.466
and I don't really care.

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:36.218
- Okay.

01:32:41.556 --> 01:32:43.434
- I really don't.

01:32:48.188 --> 01:32:50.232
- That's a pretty bold move.

01:32:53.568 --> 01:32:54.903
- Well, sometimes,

01:32:54.904 --> 01:32:56.238
bold moves are worth making.

01:32:57.572 --> 01:32:59.241
Worth the risk.

01:33:01.994 --> 01:33:04.037
- I don't...

01:33:06.415 --> 01:33:07.562
I don't know

01:33:07.563 --> 01:33:08.708
what you want me to say.

01:33:14.423 --> 01:33:15.946
- You framed them.

01:33:15.947 --> 01:33:17.468
Good idea.

01:33:20.137 --> 01:33:22.202
Look, I didn't want

01:33:22.203 --> 01:33:24.266
to come here at first.

01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:26.519
Like, I really didn't.

01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:29.062
I wanted to...

01:33:30.022 --> 01:33:31.440
shut down the part of me

01:33:31.441 --> 01:33:32.858
that missed my mom.

01:33:37.237 --> 01:33:39.532
But then, I met everyone here.

01:33:39.614 --> 01:33:41.658
And I met you.

01:33:44.244 --> 01:33:46.163
And it made me think that...

01:33:46.246 --> 01:33:47.769
even though there are some

01:33:47.770 --> 01:33:49.291
things that you can't get over,

01:33:50.042 --> 01:33:52.169
maybe it's easier...

01:33:52.252 --> 01:33:54.338
if you're not alone.

01:33:56.048 --> 01:33:57.070
If you're with someone

01:33:57.071 --> 01:33:58.091
that you...

01:34:01.053 --> 01:34:02.888
...that you trust.

01:34:06.475 --> 01:34:08.101
- You know, you can't...

01:34:08.852 --> 01:34:10.812
- Lady, we're trying to run
- an auction here,

01:34:10.896 --> 01:34:12.043
So, if you're not interested

01:34:12.044 --> 01:34:13.190
in bidding on something,

01:34:13.273 --> 01:34:15.192
maybe you should...

01:34:15.275 --> 01:34:16.902
Hit the road.

01:34:18.862 --> 01:34:20.531
- Wow.

01:34:24.076 --> 01:34:25.911
What's this worth?

01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:32.418
- A gift expert once told me

01:34:32.419 --> 01:34:34.545
at least a million dollars.

01:34:37.881 --> 01:34:39.341
- Sold.

01:34:42.636 --> 01:34:44.346
Gift expert, huh?

01:34:47.099 --> 01:34:48.100
- Please gather round,

01:34:48.101 --> 01:34:49.101
everyone.

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:50.811
Santa has a very special message

01:34:50.812 --> 01:34:52.438
to share with all of us.

01:34:52.521 --> 01:34:53.980
- Thank you, Debbie.

01:34:54.064 --> 01:34:55.837
Thank you everyone

01:34:55.838 --> 01:34:57.610
for being here tonight

01:34:57.692 --> 01:34:59.423
and thanks to all of you who've

01:34:59.424 --> 01:35:01.154
donated to the charity auction

01:35:01.238 --> 01:35:02.239
for making this Christmas

01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:03.240
in Snow Falls

01:35:03.323 --> 01:35:05.618
so special for so many people.

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:06.827
Hear, hear!

01:35:11.081 --> 01:35:12.771
Now, before we continue

01:35:12.772 --> 01:35:14.460
with our festivities,

01:35:14.543 --> 01:35:15.669
I received

01:35:15.670 --> 01:35:16.795
a very special letter.

01:35:16.878 --> 01:35:19.465
It's... uh...

01:35:19.548 --> 01:35:22.050
from an old friend of our town.

01:35:22.134 --> 01:35:23.615
He wanted me to make sure

01:35:23.616 --> 01:35:25.095
that I read it here tonight.

01:35:27.139 --> 01:35:29.642
It's dated December of this year

01:35:29.724 --> 01:35:31.247
and it goes like this:

01:35:31.248 --> 01:35:32.769
"Dear Zeke..."

01:35:33.917 --> 01:35:34.980
Uncle Zeke!

01:35:36.231 --> 01:35:37.316
- "Well, the time has come,

01:35:37.317 --> 01:35:38.400
old friend,

01:35:38.484 --> 01:35:39.735
for me to step down

01:35:39.736 --> 01:35:40.986
as Chief Executive

01:35:41.069 --> 01:35:42.279
of Home & Hearth Gifts.

01:35:42.362 --> 01:35:44.072
And with your blessing,

01:35:44.156 --> 01:35:46.492
I want to present someone

01:35:46.575 --> 01:35:49.036
who I think would be the perfect

01:35:49.037 --> 01:35:51.497
candidate to take my place.

01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:54.166
My daughter, Ellen."

01:35:54.249 --> 01:35:55.875
That's Ellen Langford!

01:35:55.959 --> 01:35:57.232
- "I'm sending her up

01:35:57.233 --> 01:35:58.504
to visit Snow Falls incognito

01:35:58.587 --> 01:36:00.026
so she doesn't get

01:36:00.027 --> 01:36:01.465
any special treatment,

01:36:01.548 --> 01:36:03.216
but instead, gets

01:36:03.217 --> 01:36:04.884
some first-hand experience

01:36:04.968 --> 01:36:06.679
with our hometown

01:36:06.761 --> 01:36:08.888
and the wonderful people in it.

01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:11.641
I'd love for her to learn

01:36:11.642 --> 01:36:12.892
about the important things

01:36:12.976 --> 01:36:14.457
that started us off

01:36:14.458 --> 01:36:15.937
on the right track:

01:36:16.021 --> 01:36:19.399
Tradition. Friendship.

01:36:19.483 --> 01:36:22.027
And love.

01:36:24.613 --> 01:36:26.469
Because those are

01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:28.325
the most important things

01:36:28.408 --> 01:36:29.430
that we could ever

01:36:29.431 --> 01:36:30.452
give each other.

01:36:32.787 --> 01:36:34.665
Merry Christmas."

01:36:37.917 --> 01:36:39.419
Ah!

01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:40.920
- Congratulations, Ellie.

01:36:41.004 --> 01:36:42.110
It couldn't happen

01:36:42.111 --> 01:36:43.215
to a finer young lady.

01:36:43.298 --> 01:36:44.925
- So, that's why

01:36:44.926 --> 01:36:46.552
you stayed away?

01:36:46.635 --> 01:36:48.845
To let me get to know everyone?

01:36:48.928 --> 01:36:50.034
- And to let them get

01:36:50.035 --> 01:36:51.139
to know you.

01:36:51.223 --> 01:36:52.641
The real you,

01:36:52.725 --> 01:36:55.227
- without big ol' me and your pops
- getting in the way.

01:36:56.687 --> 01:36:57.937
- But I left.

01:36:58.938 --> 01:37:00.733
How did you know I'd come back?

01:37:00.815 --> 01:37:02.609
- We didn't know.

01:37:02.693 --> 01:37:05.404
We had faith you would.

01:37:05.487 --> 01:37:07.864
And I'm sure glad you did.

01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:10.930
- Let me tell you,

01:37:10.931 --> 01:37:12.160
nobody's gladder than me!

01:37:12.244 --> 01:37:13.599
Look who it is!

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:14.954
- Otherwise, I'd have made

01:37:12.244 --> 01:37:14.954
the trip for nothing.

01:37:15.038 --> 01:37:16.164
- Dad!

01:37:16.248 --> 01:37:17.999
- Come here!

01:37:21.086 --> 01:37:22.462
- I'm sorry I didn't deliver

01:37:22.463 --> 01:37:23.838
the Christmas letter myself.

01:37:23.922 --> 01:37:26.174
- Oh, honey, you have nothing
- to apologize for.

01:37:26.258 --> 01:37:27.468
First of all, you couldn't

01:37:27.469 --> 01:37:28.677
have delivered it

01:37:28.761 --> 01:37:30.617
even if you'd tried.

01:37:30.618 --> 01:37:32.472
I pulled a bit of a fast one

01:37:32.556 --> 01:37:33.870
and... sent it on ahead

01:37:33.871 --> 01:37:35.183
to Zeke myself.

01:37:35.267 --> 01:37:37.269
- Just so he'd know
- what was going on, you know.

01:37:37.352 --> 01:37:38.666
- Why don't you guys

01:37:38.667 --> 01:37:39.979
just call each other?

01:37:40.063 --> 01:37:41.419
- Because we've recorded

01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:42.775
every single important step

01:37:42.857 --> 01:37:44.130
in our lives

01:37:44.131 --> 01:37:45.402
in those Christmas letters

01:37:45.485 --> 01:37:46.757
and this is one

01:37:46.758 --> 01:37:48.029
very important step.

01:37:48.113 --> 01:37:49.677
- Besides, delivering the letter

01:37:49.678 --> 01:37:51.241
wasn't the real test.

01:37:51.324 --> 01:37:53.786
The real test, for you, was...

01:37:53.868 --> 01:37:55.099
winning over

01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:56.329
all these wonderful folks.

01:37:57.872 --> 01:37:59.625
And win them over you did.

01:37:59.708 --> 01:38:01.252
- Anyone who can get me

01:38:01.253 --> 01:38:02.795
to donate a free product...

01:38:02.877 --> 01:38:04.338
is a pro.

01:38:07.882 --> 01:38:10.009
- Hey, Dad, I want to show you
- the auction.

01:38:10.093 --> 01:38:11.345
- Yeah, yeah.

01:38:11.346 --> 01:38:12.596
- They're all from local shops.

01:38:12.679 --> 01:38:14.264
They're one of a kind gifts.

01:38:14.265 --> 01:38:15.849
Really beautiful stuff.

01:38:15.932 --> 01:38:18.017
- Wow. You did this?

01:38:18.101 --> 01:38:20.228
- I did.

01:38:20.312 --> 01:38:21.730
I was thinking next year,

01:38:21.731 --> 01:38:23.148
maybe we could do some sort of

01:38:23.231 --> 01:38:24.628
special collection of

01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:26.025
one-of-a-kind gifts

01:38:26.109 --> 01:38:27.194
from the town

01:38:27.195 --> 01:38:28.278
where it all began.

01:38:28.361 --> 01:38:29.800
Maybe call it:

01:38:29.801 --> 01:38:31.239
With Love, From Snow Falls.

01:38:31.323 --> 01:38:32.950
- An excellent idea,

01:38:32.951 --> 01:38:34.576
Ms. Chief Executive Officer.

01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:37.037
But let's talk about work

01:38:37.038 --> 01:38:38.163
tomorrow morning, huh?

01:38:38.246 --> 01:38:40.165
It's Christmas Eve.

01:38:43.752 --> 01:38:44.962
- I think someone wants

01:38:44.963 --> 01:38:46.171
to see you.

01:38:47.756 --> 01:38:49.382
- Excuse me.

01:39:02.228 --> 01:39:04.439
- Hey, folks!

01:39:04.523 --> 01:39:05.691
So I promised you all

01:39:05.692 --> 01:39:06.859
a very special guest

01:39:06.941 --> 01:39:08.526
and here she is to sing

01:39:08.527 --> 01:39:10.111
a very special song,

01:39:10.195 --> 01:39:12.322
our very own Debbie Collins.

01:39:12.405 --> 01:39:13.886
- Thank you all so much.

01:39:13.887 --> 01:39:15.367
You're all so sweet.

01:39:20.413 --> 01:39:21.644
I haven't done this in a few

01:39:21.645 --> 01:39:22.875
years, but it is Christmas,

01:39:22.957 --> 01:39:24.626
so here we go.
