00:01.479 --> 00:03.264
-Previously on Wynonna Earp:
-Hey.
-Hi...

00:03.307 --> 00:05.396
-Miss Wynonna Earp.
-Make me the lieutenant.
You want me to beg?

00:05.440 --> 00:06.919
: I raised someone
from the dead.

00:06.963 --> 00:10.271
I'm here to save humanity.
I need to climb those stairs.

00:10.314 --> 00:13.013
This whole thing
is an Apocaly-tunity.

00:13.056 --> 00:15.667
: He's Julian.
He's my father.

00:15.711 --> 00:18.888
-We need to get Peacemaker.
-Mr. Del Ray.

00:18.931 --> 00:21.760
-Sheriff Clootie.
-Bulshar wants to keep us
hating each other.

00:21.804 --> 00:25.634
That way we can't
come together and take
out our real enemy: him!

00:25.677 --> 00:29.029
So what do you say?
Anybody wanna go break
a goddamn curse?

00:34.295 --> 00:36.079
I fucking loved hunting
and killing you all.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.823
From the moment
I first fired Peacemaker -

00:42.129 --> 00:43.434
really fired it -

00:44.566 --> 00:47.743
and sent my first Revenant
back to hell, Malcolm--

00:47.786 --> 00:50.572
-Dick.
-...I knew it was
what I was meant to do.

00:50.615 --> 00:53.053
Even if it was supposed to be
someone else -

00:53.096 --> 00:54.402
my sister, Willa -

00:55.968 --> 00:57.927
the Earp heir was gonna be me.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.759
I've never said it out loud
to anyone before:

01:04.673 --> 01:07.241
The only thing I've ever been
any good at is killing.

01:08.851 --> 01:10.418
But I'm willing to give it up.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.509
I am willing to go back
to being...

01:16.119 --> 01:17.425
...not much of anything.

01:19.253 --> 01:22.125
A woman with stellar hair -
shout-out to Jarvis
for the ringlets -

01:22.169 --> 01:25.041
a tired liver,
a loaded last name, and...

01:27.739 --> 01:29.176
...this land.

01:32.875 --> 01:36.487
Land that, as a show of faith,
I'm also willing to share.

01:36.531 --> 01:38.881
Like we've been forced
to share this curse.

01:42.058 --> 01:44.974
You were criminals and...
outlaws,

01:45.017 --> 01:47.107
and I don't know
what you'll become...

01:48.804 --> 01:51.763
...when we take down the snake
who made us what we are.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.418
But I know we'll be free.

01:54.462 --> 01:57.117
-Oh, yeah!

01:57.160 --> 01:59.293
Gonna take that
as a "Yes, Queen!"

02:03.210 --> 02:04.472
So we get ready.

02:05.777 --> 02:07.127
And we fight.

02:09.694 --> 02:12.306
And we end Sheriff Clootie
once and for all.

02:12.349 --> 02:14.003
: Yeah.
: Alright,
let's go!

02:15.700 --> 02:16.658
Together.

02:20.531 --> 02:22.881
-Whoo!

02:22.925 --> 02:25.580
But first... we bourbon!!!

02:29.453 --> 02:31.629
"I have not come here
to bring peace...

02:32.848 --> 02:34.284
...but a sword."

02:50.605 --> 02:51.823
You...

03:06.838 --> 03:08.623
He wasn't mortal.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.582
Righteous.
And neither am I.

03:12.453 --> 03:13.758
Not yet.

03:16.065 --> 03:18.415
It's such a beautiful moon.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.461
Go have some fun.

03:20.504 --> 03:24.116
Oh - and slaughter
every last one of them.

03:26.641 --> 03:29.339
And you, Lieutenant...

03:30.645 --> 03:32.603
...bring what I need to ascend.

03:32.647 --> 03:37.042
Bring me Earp...
bitch... blood.

03:43.135 --> 03:46.269
♪ 'Cause I gave you
all I got to give ♪

03:46.313 --> 03:48.532
♪ I know
that ain't no way to live ♪

03:48.576 --> 03:51.361
♪ I told that devil

03:51.405 --> 03:53.711
♪ To take you back

03:53.755 --> 03:58.673
♪ I told that devil
to take you back ♪♪

04:00.240 --> 04:01.676
Where are you?

04:03.460 --> 04:06.594
-Wynonna.
!

04:07.899 --> 04:10.293
Can't be.
I'm happy to see your face.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.164
Oh, God.

04:12.208 --> 04:14.558
I'm glad you're here
if it's going down.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.256
I'm yelling timber.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.131
Hi, Miss Waverly.

04:25.656 --> 04:27.658
-Keith's here.
-Mm-hmm.

04:27.702 --> 04:28.833
Keith the Revenant.

04:28.877 --> 04:31.793
There's a whole bunch more
in the house.

04:31.836 --> 04:34.317
-Okay...
-Like, most of the Revenants.

04:34.361 --> 04:37.451
-Yep.
-I have an army
of Revenants now.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.279
-Cool, cool, cool.
-You seem oddly unfazed.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.847
Oh, God,
I feel like I can top that.

04:44.545 --> 04:46.503
I may not be pissed at you,
but Charlie was supposed

04:46.547 --> 04:48.418
to have you out of
the Ghost River Triangle by now.

04:48.462 --> 04:51.073
Charlie was supposed
to be a lot of things.

04:51.116 --> 04:52.161
Instead...

04:53.293 --> 04:54.424
he's my father.

04:55.991 --> 04:58.733
Wynonna... I know it's a lot.

05:04.086 --> 05:05.522
He has wings.

05:09.918 --> 05:13.269
: I'm a feather.
I am a plant.
I am a gust of wind.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.794
I am a feather. I am a plant.
I am a gust of wind. I'm a...

05:16.838 --> 05:18.492
Hey. Any sign of a Bobo?

05:18.535 --> 05:20.407
No, not even a Bo.
Are you Zen yet?

05:20.450 --> 05:23.627
I am a feather. I am a plant.
I am a gust of wind.

05:23.671 --> 05:28.632
I am freaking out right
now, because...
I'm just procrastinating.

05:28.676 --> 05:31.722
You know, I should be using
this arm to figure out
how to stop the big bad,

05:31.766 --> 05:34.464
but I'm gonna fail,
like I failed Dolls and
everyone else and--

05:34.508 --> 05:37.032
Stop. Stop. Stop. Breathe.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.163
Breathe.

05:38.207 --> 05:39.556
Oh, yes.

05:42.733 --> 05:44.866
Okay, you're my personal
meditation app.

05:44.909 --> 05:47.695
-You can double-tap me anytime.
-Ah, maybe later.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.353
-Thanks, Jett.
-Ah, no big.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.355
It's in my best interest
that you stop the apocalypse,

05:55.398 --> 05:57.922
and you need to be calm
to do that, so...

05:57.966 --> 06:01.404
Okay, okay. Okay, so...

06:01.448 --> 06:04.842
Bulshar is organic
and a snake, so...

06:04.886 --> 06:07.236
maybe he's poisonous
like the widow wives were,

06:07.279 --> 06:10.021
and I can make some sort
of anti-venom...

06:12.763 --> 06:13.808
Whoa.

06:15.070 --> 06:17.159
-Doc.

06:17.202 --> 06:19.030
Yeah, but... he's not.

06:21.119 --> 06:22.817
Yeah, but we gotta keep going.

06:22.860 --> 06:27.299
My ex-boyfriend Charlie...
is your father, Julian.

06:27.343 --> 06:31.129
-Yep.
-Oh, hose job,
this is gonna kill Mama.

06:33.523 --> 06:36.004
It's not Mama
I'm worried about.

06:36.047 --> 06:38.615
-Mm...
-Mama's not here.

06:38.659 --> 06:39.616
Mm.

06:41.444 --> 06:44.273
-Neither is Doc.
-Oh, yeah, um...

06:44.316 --> 06:46.188
Doc... is...

06:47.450 --> 06:48.930
...not okay.

06:48.973 --> 06:51.889
Did he sleep
with Charlie and... Julie too?

06:51.933 --> 06:53.978
No.

06:54.022 --> 06:55.415
Doc killed Charlie.

06:55.458 --> 06:58.243
-Uh-huh.
-Then I resurrected him
with the ring,

06:58.287 --> 06:59.984
and, uh...

07:00.028 --> 07:02.639
well, then Doc tried
to kill him again.

07:04.511 --> 07:07.078
But how does my hair look?

07:08.166 --> 07:09.472
-Wynonna--
-Please.

07:10.604 --> 07:13.215
What can I possibly say?

07:14.651 --> 07:17.175
Bulshar's about to get
into the Garden of Eden...

07:18.133 --> 07:20.527
...and do something
to destroy humanity.

07:20.570 --> 07:24.400
I don't have my magic gun
that can kill
my demonic enemies,

07:24.444 --> 07:27.534
who are currently in
my kitchen, so...

07:27.577 --> 07:30.058
finding out that I schtupped
my sister's dad...

07:31.799 --> 07:32.887
Perspective.

07:34.018 --> 07:35.367
It's a good look on you.

07:38.327 --> 07:41.722
And if it's all gonna end,
whatever he did...

07:41.765 --> 07:43.245
...I need to find Doc.

07:44.333 --> 07:47.379
-My Doc.
-Yeah. I need to find Nicole.

07:52.689 --> 07:55.518
And you know
your hair looks great.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.694
I know, but is it
end

08:03.961 --> 08:05.528
Oof.

08:05.572 --> 08:08.749
-Not as much as losing my man.

08:08.792 --> 08:11.534
You mean the vampire
who left you for dead?

08:11.578 --> 08:15.538
Oh, he didn't think I'd die.
And I didn't, thanks to you.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.888
You're kinda judgey
for a Capricorn.

08:17.932 --> 08:22.023
Yeah, well, I'm also a cop,
so forgive me if I don't find
the bad-boyfriend dance amusing.

08:22.066 --> 08:23.938
Like you're not ruled
by tu coneja.

08:23.981 --> 08:25.853
Okay, yes, I admit it,

08:25.896 --> 08:29.421
I'm a little worried
about my girlfriend
due to impending apocalypse.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.336
So clingy.

08:31.380 --> 08:34.383
Okay, seriously,
where the frig is Waverly?

08:35.689 --> 08:38.387
Sorry. Just... really like her.

08:38.430 --> 08:41.608
Never apologize for love,
Red. Not to me.

08:50.007 --> 08:52.314
Waverly's with Wynonna.

08:52.357 --> 08:54.882
Good, but she's supposed to be
with Charlie.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.322
The one with the sweet blood.

09:05.153 --> 09:08.112
She's not with him, but...
of him.

09:09.113 --> 09:10.985
-Bulshar's minions!
-You couldn't have seen
this coming?!

09:11.028 --> 09:11.681
Ah!

09:18.427 --> 09:20.037
Damn, girl,
you sure you're not a Scorpio?

09:23.911 --> 09:24.781
Ah!!

09:36.619 --> 09:40.057
Honey, I'm home.
Also, I despise honey.

09:40.101 --> 09:41.929
-You're welcome.

09:42.799 --> 09:46.107
They look like big dongs,
but they're actually
giant pussies.

09:47.064 --> 09:48.196
Who is that?

09:48.239 --> 09:50.154
I'm Kate. I live here.

09:50.198 --> 09:52.592
Then we gotta talk rent
and redecorating.

09:54.245 --> 09:56.334
-I gotta go.
-Yeah, you should.

09:56.378 --> 10:00.425
Because Bulshar will have
released his little bee boys
on all of Wynonna's friends.

10:00.469 --> 10:02.906
They've got one,
so they'll be coming
after the others.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.996
I should know,
I'm kind of married to him.
It's a whole thing.

10:08.259 --> 10:10.784
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just... a flesh wound.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.742
That smells
like vanilla-dipped donuts.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.788
Okay, so she's a vampire?

10:14.831 --> 10:16.920
Yeah.
Can you take care of her?

10:16.964 --> 10:18.269
She can't fully heal
until night falls.

10:18.313 --> 10:20.315
Which it won't,
due to the pledge moon.

10:20.358 --> 10:22.839
Not unless Team Earp
defeats him. Go.

10:22.883 --> 10:25.189
Okay? She tries to bite me,
she gets slapped.

10:26.103 --> 10:27.975
-I kinda like her.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.372
Okay, yeah,
I-I-I think I got it.

10:34.416 --> 10:36.113
I think
I actually figured it out.

10:36.157 --> 10:38.463
-I knew you'd crush this.

10:38.507 --> 10:41.597
-Oh, Nedley had a drawer
full of backup shirts,

10:41.641 --> 10:43.643
and this one was, you know,
the least-stained.

10:43.686 --> 10:46.428
What, you went to get coffee
and you came back The Heat?

10:46.471 --> 10:48.909
Did I not mention
Nicole sort of deputized me?

10:48.952 --> 10:51.738
-Wait. I am, uh,
I'm dating a cop?

10:51.781 --> 10:56.394
-Did you just say you know
how to make the anti
-Uh, yeah, well...

10:56.438 --> 11:00.398
Why so nonchalant, big
This is huge. You should be...
chalant!

11:00.442 --> 11:02.531
No, I mean, I've figured out
how we can navigate

11:02.574 --> 11:04.489
the sporey forest
unseen by the beekeepers.

11:04.533 --> 11:08.406
It's just gonna take
four months to synthesize,
and I don't know... Move!

11:08.450 --> 11:10.582
-Move!

11:13.934 --> 11:16.023
No way are they shoving
a big, nasty seed in me
this time.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.981
Why aren't they attacking?

11:18.025 --> 11:21.724
Just stopped, dammit,
for a couple of spare shirts,

11:21.768 --> 11:24.466
and you dingle-dangles
had to ruin everything.

11:26.033 --> 11:28.949
-You boys,
you go ahead and duck.

11:28.992 --> 11:29.514
Whoa!

11:34.171 --> 11:37.000
Okay, breathe, Haught.

11:37.044 --> 11:39.089
Get your panties
out of your buns.

11:42.527 --> 11:43.659
Ah...

11:44.878 --> 11:46.923
Turns out getting stabbed
really hurts.

11:52.973 --> 11:55.497
Of all the jerks in all the...

11:55.540 --> 11:57.368
gin joints...

12:02.460 --> 12:06.421
-No, I only whip them out
when I need 'em.

12:06.464 --> 12:07.770
They're like windshield wipers.

12:07.814 --> 12:08.902
Or condoms.

12:08.945 --> 12:09.990
Yeah.

12:11.121 --> 12:12.079
Um...

12:12.122 --> 12:15.038
-So... Charlie--
-No, it's Julian.

12:16.692 --> 12:19.347
Wynonna, I did...
I did not know.

12:19.390 --> 12:23.046
I did not remember
until Waverly touched me
with this.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.309
-So you're an angel.
-I am.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.921
Tasked with guarding the garden
eons ago.

12:27.964 --> 12:30.750
I watched humanity flourish...

12:32.186 --> 12:35.624
...get tempted and fall,
all at the hands of a snake.

12:35.667 --> 12:36.756
Bulshar.

12:37.713 --> 12:38.801
He wants back in it.

12:38.845 --> 12:39.976
Well, it's Paradise.

12:41.891 --> 12:43.197
Or so they say.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.199
-I never left my post.

12:45.242 --> 12:46.983
Until I did for your mother.

12:48.855 --> 12:51.031
-I truly loved her.

12:51.074 --> 12:53.468
This just gets better
and better.

12:53.511 --> 12:55.296
Juan Carlo went first,

12:55.339 --> 12:58.473
when we saw that Bulshar
had returned
to the Ghost River Triangle.

12:58.516 --> 13:02.433
He disguised himself as a padre
and we removed the garden's
security system -

13:03.391 --> 13:05.349
a flaming sword -

13:05.393 --> 13:08.396
and we sought a champion
to wield it.
A mortal champion.

13:09.658 --> 13:12.313
-Wyatt Earp.
-He was brave and true.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.402
Didn't quite finish the job,
though, did he?

13:14.445 --> 13:17.144
No. I suspect he was in a rush.

13:18.275 --> 13:20.712
To see his best friend
one last time before he died.

13:22.976 --> 13:24.325
It runs in the family.

13:26.109 --> 13:28.982
Just... tell me you'll do
whatever it takes

13:29.025 --> 13:31.767
so Waverly won't have to--
-Officer Haught.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.555
Oh, my God, Nicole.

13:39.470 --> 13:42.212
-Go get Waverly.

13:42.256 --> 13:43.431
Doc!

13:43.474 --> 13:45.520
I'm not permitted
in the house, remember?

13:45.563 --> 13:47.957
You're fucking permitted!
I'm permitting you!
Please, she's all alone.

13:48.001 --> 13:50.003
-Oh, my God!

13:51.439 --> 13:54.268
Sweetie, you're really
starting to freak me out.

13:54.311 --> 13:58.663
I have so much to tell you.
Like... like, so much.

14:03.016 --> 14:05.018
Bobo?

14:05.061 --> 14:09.065
For years, I was certain
that Ward didn't deserve this
life, this... home.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.722
You. My angel.

14:15.115 --> 14:16.638
And now I'm sure of it.

14:20.729 --> 14:22.731
You... met your father?

14:24.385 --> 14:26.126
Your real father.

14:26.169 --> 14:28.345
-Mm...

14:28.389 --> 14:30.217
Even if I wanted to...

14:40.531 --> 14:42.098
...I am of him now.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.683
I'm calling in my favour,
Waverly.

15:04.338 --> 15:05.252
A favour?

15:06.818 --> 15:09.386
A favour, after all you've done
to our family.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.563
When the time comes...

15:15.827 --> 15:17.786
...I want you to set me free.

15:21.790 --> 15:23.661
-I could fix this.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.663
Could? This is the love
of your daughter's life.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.841
-There will be a price to pay.
-There always is.

15:29.885 --> 15:31.104
There always is.

15:36.196 --> 15:37.893
-Shhh.

16:00.263 --> 16:01.612
You did it.

16:02.831 --> 16:03.788
Mm...

16:06.313 --> 16:07.183
Did we get 'em?

16:08.445 --> 16:10.621
Stay with her.
I'm going to Waverly.

16:17.150 --> 16:18.499
This was in the greenhouse.

16:23.243 --> 16:25.897
I lost this a long time ago.

16:25.941 --> 16:29.249
Doc, you would not have been
able to hold this if your soul
was truly compromised.

16:34.906 --> 16:37.170
Dudes, we slayed!

16:37.213 --> 16:40.390
We cut through 'em like RuPaul
cuts through performances
without heart.

16:40.434 --> 16:45.047
-I haven't seen that show.
-Get your life in order, son.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.658
I couldn't work fast enough.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.008
I give up.

16:50.357 --> 16:53.534
Did Lou Bega give up
after Mambos 1 through 4 failed?

16:53.577 --> 16:57.190
No. He wrote Mambo No. 5,
and the rest is music history.

16:57.233 --> 17:00.671
I'm so thrilled I get to die
with that song
stuck in my head.

17:00.715 --> 17:04.545
Yeah, it's true that later
he had to go through
this lengthy copyright trial.

17:04.588 --> 17:06.634
-They were claiming
it was less than original.
-Well--

17:06.677 --> 17:10.594
Okay, you take a little bit
of Monica, a little bit of...

17:10.638 --> 17:13.945
-No, no, no, no.

17:13.989 --> 17:17.079
You take a little bit
of Bulshar.

17:17.123 --> 17:20.169
And... and a little bit
of Robin!

17:20.213 --> 17:22.302
-Your blood. You're immune.

17:22.345 --> 17:23.825
That's why the beekeepers
didn't attack you.

17:23.868 --> 17:26.784
They thought
that you were one of their own.

17:26.828 --> 17:29.265
You know
you can't unblender stuff!

17:32.703 --> 17:34.053
Mambo No. 6!

17:38.405 --> 17:40.885
Well, I think
you should put it on puree.

17:56.423 --> 17:57.815
Julian...

17:57.859 --> 18:00.688
Angel boy.
It's been a long time.

18:00.731 --> 18:04.083
And now you're back
and ready to take credit

18:04.126 --> 18:05.997
for everything
this girl has become,

18:06.041 --> 18:08.261
all on her own.

18:08.304 --> 18:11.568
We both know the best parts
of Waverly came from her mother.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.793
You've been changed.

18:18.836 --> 18:21.535
You gave up your free will.
I can't save you now.

18:23.493 --> 18:25.452
-But I can end it.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.717
Thanks.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.111
But I've already chosen
my exit strategy.

18:45.820 --> 18:50.781
-Nicole's okay.
Is she not okay?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.220
I used everything I had
to save her.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.489
Now you need this
more than me.

19:02.532 --> 19:03.664
And soon.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.233
Bulshar's brought the fight
to us.

19:17.547 --> 19:19.941
-I thought this would go down
at the stairs.
-Me too.

19:19.984 --> 19:22.161
I guess Bulshar's
missing something.

19:22.204 --> 19:24.380
Yeah. Me.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.995
This is bad. Is this bad?

19:31.039 --> 19:34.564
-It ain't great.
-We had to survive the Old West.

19:34.608 --> 19:39.178
Bulshar has sorely
underestimated the utter
assholes he's up against!

19:40.527 --> 19:42.224
Wynonna!
What the...

19:42.268 --> 19:45.271
: Grenades!
: No!! Ah!!

19:45.314 --> 19:46.533
Here comes the rain!

20:05.291 --> 20:06.509
Alright, now I'm pissed.

20:09.295 --> 20:10.992
Take your time, boys!

20:14.169 --> 20:15.997
The Devil's Paintbrush.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.738
They got a Browning!!!

20:24.745 --> 20:26.094
Nicole's still in the barn!

20:29.445 --> 20:31.360
-Argh!!

20:31.404 --> 20:34.189
I need to get to the house!
We need real guns!

20:39.586 --> 20:41.892
-Hui!!
-Go! Don't let him waste this!

20:46.593 --> 20:47.246
Ah!!

20:50.597 --> 20:55.341
Waverly, they have got a mother
of a machine gun! We packing?

20:55.384 --> 20:57.343
Like a bed wetter
for summer camp!

21:06.047 --> 21:08.919
-Don't come near me!
-I am the least
of your problems.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.443
You killed Charlie.

21:10.486 --> 21:13.489
I have done much worse.
But I will not hurt you.

21:23.499 --> 21:25.284
Time to clear out
the old swimming hole.

21:44.172 --> 21:47.393
-Ah!
-The Master will have his gift.

21:48.959 --> 21:51.701
Ah!!! Oh, bitch!

21:51.745 --> 21:53.442
Get off me!! No!

21:54.965 --> 21:55.749
Argh!

21:59.840 --> 22:01.363
I swear to God!

22:01.407 --> 22:04.323
God... is not here.

22:05.976 --> 22:07.108
Wynonna!

22:07.978 --> 22:09.110
Wynonna!

22:13.506 --> 22:16.596
He hasn't been here
for a long, long time.

22:18.075 --> 22:19.207
Nhuuh...

22:36.833 --> 22:38.574
Wynonna! Where is she?!

22:39.749 --> 22:41.882
The wood pile! Bulshar!!

22:43.927 --> 22:45.102
-No!

22:45.146 --> 22:47.714
No!! No!! No!

22:47.757 --> 22:49.542
No!!!

22:49.585 --> 22:51.108
-Uh!
-No!

22:54.416 --> 22:55.983
The angel returneth.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.421
Better late than never.

22:59.465 --> 23:02.119
-You must not enter the garden.
-You've never even seen it.

23:04.034 --> 23:05.645
-Now you never will.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.173
Where's your ring?

23:24.664 --> 23:26.405
-Charlie.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.673
Charlie!

23:33.716 --> 23:34.238
Dad!!!

24:00.526 --> 24:03.180
Learn some new tricks,
you old, tired bitch.

24:03.224 --> 24:04.617
Henry.

24:04.660 --> 24:08.403
Mortal weapons... can't kill me.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.883
This isn't mortal.

24:18.108 --> 24:19.980
You could've been better
than this.

24:21.503 --> 24:22.461
There.

24:23.723 --> 24:24.898
You're free.

24:30.556 --> 24:31.687
Thank you.

24:51.794 --> 24:53.840
The curse has bound us,
Bulshar!

24:56.320 --> 24:59.585
All I have to do is
touch you, dickwad,
and this whole thing is over.

24:59.628 --> 25:01.674
For once, you're almost right.

25:02.936 --> 25:04.241
It is over.

25:13.381 --> 25:14.425
Wynonna!

25:15.688 --> 25:17.385
Where are the other Revenants?
What happened?

25:17.428 --> 25:18.517
Wynonna.

25:20.083 --> 25:21.389
Wynonna, your nose.

25:23.391 --> 25:24.523
They're gone.

25:26.829 --> 25:28.222
And I'm just...

25:32.008 --> 25:35.969
-I don't have it, anymore.
-Wha...

25:36.012 --> 25:37.318
Bulshar did it.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.888
He broke the Earp curse.

25:57.730 --> 26:01.081
I tried and tried and...
wake him up again, but...

26:03.387 --> 26:04.475
...it won't work this time.

26:06.303 --> 26:07.566
The ring won't work.

26:15.399 --> 26:17.576
-Hey, Waves.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.448
Where... where are the others?

26:20.491 --> 26:22.450
I think, um...

26:23.407 --> 26:25.932
I think Nicole's in the barn
and...

26:25.975 --> 26:27.324
uh, Wynonna and Doc are...

26:27.368 --> 26:28.935
Wait. Doc's here?

26:30.023 --> 26:31.720
Where the hell have you been?

26:33.766 --> 26:34.593
Sorry.

26:36.769 --> 26:38.248
Just sad.

26:38.292 --> 26:40.903
-No, I know.
You can feel it
with your power?

26:42.122 --> 26:44.907
No. I can see it
on my best friend's face.

26:47.214 --> 26:50.260
Jeremy's been working
on something that'll give us
a fighting chance.

26:50.304 --> 26:51.522
Yes, uh...

26:57.616 --> 27:01.054
I dragged the last
of the beekeeper corpses
to the garden out back.

27:02.229 --> 27:04.057
We usually just use manure.

27:04.927 --> 27:08.061
I doubt anything will grow
within 10 feet of it this year.

27:12.282 --> 27:15.068
I am sorry... about Charlie.

27:18.593 --> 27:20.247
He was the love
of my mom's life.

27:22.989 --> 27:24.730
He died to save Waverly.

27:27.733 --> 27:30.083
There is nothing
he would not have done for her.

27:31.214 --> 27:32.651
She was his daughter.

27:36.611 --> 27:37.873
And ours is free.

27:39.745 --> 27:41.181
The Earp curse is broken.

27:47.143 --> 27:49.145
You did it.
You did it, Wynonna.

27:49.189 --> 27:51.321
No. Not me.

27:52.888 --> 27:56.849
Bulshar... with my own blood.
He tricked me.

27:56.892 --> 27:57.676
Why?

27:59.199 --> 28:01.462
I think he needs to be mortal
to get into the garden,

28:01.505 --> 28:04.683
and... when we were linked,
my touch could end him.

28:04.726 --> 28:07.511
So he used my blood
to unlink us and...

28:07.555 --> 28:10.297
became vulnerable.
Like me.

28:17.913 --> 28:19.698
I have done terrible...

28:21.134 --> 28:22.701
...terrible things.

28:26.095 --> 28:30.317
But I will fight until the end
by your side.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.710
If you'll have me.

28:44.418 --> 28:47.508
After everything you've done,
how could I possibly trust you?

28:50.293 --> 28:51.381
Clearly you cannot.

28:52.818 --> 28:55.124
These things will not be able
to keep me here.

28:55.168 --> 28:57.779
But a rope
soaked in holy water will.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.085
Do not do this.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.482
See you on the other side,
Doc.

29:05.526 --> 29:08.398
Wynonna,
what are you gonna do?!
Wynonna!

29:11.358 --> 29:12.533
Wynonna Earp!!

29:19.409 --> 29:20.976
I thought I'd lost you.

29:22.108 --> 29:25.111
No, I'm just having
some baby carrots.

29:41.301 --> 29:43.303
I'm so sorry about Charlie.

29:46.567 --> 29:48.090
About your father, Charlie.

29:50.614 --> 29:52.225
What I meant before...

29:54.357 --> 29:55.663
...before and...

29:56.751 --> 29:58.448
and now is, uh...

30:01.321 --> 30:03.802
I'm not losing
anyone else I love today.

30:05.368 --> 30:06.456
No.

30:14.595 --> 30:15.814
Because I do...

30:18.773 --> 30:21.254
I do, Ni...
Nicole really Haught.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.476
I really, really love you.

30:33.570 --> 30:36.660
And I really, really hate
this ring.

30:39.011 --> 30:39.925
Is that a yes?

30:41.709 --> 30:43.754
:
Bring it in, Team Earp.
Now, please.

30:47.584 --> 30:49.064
It's a crypsis. I...

30:49.108 --> 30:51.371
I blendered Bulshar's arm
just to make it.

30:51.414 --> 30:53.416
Wait, wait, wait.
Does he mean blended?

30:53.460 --> 30:55.766
-Oh, he does not.

30:55.810 --> 30:59.031
Crypsis. The ability
of an animal to avoid detection
by other animals.

30:59.074 --> 31:01.772
-Camouflage.
-We need to coat ourselves
in, well...?

31:01.816 --> 31:03.905
-Dab ourselves with.
-Wrap it up, nerds.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.298
And the beekeepers
won't be able to see us.

31:05.341 --> 31:07.387
Which means
that they can't stop us.

31:07.430 --> 31:09.780
-And we won't.
Not till Bulshar gets dead.
-Yes!

31:11.304 --> 31:14.133
-Uh...

31:14.176 --> 31:15.525
The curse is broken.

31:16.483 --> 31:18.572
There is no Earp heir.

31:18.615 --> 31:21.880
I'm just a girl
with a big ass... ass.

31:21.923 --> 31:23.577
Girl.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.144
You're right,
them boots is tight.

31:25.187 --> 31:28.060
-Yeah, top-shelf.
-Hey, this is good.

31:28.103 --> 31:30.323
There's usually
a lot of vagina jokes.

31:32.978 --> 31:34.893
-This would be the part
of the movie

31:34.936 --> 31:37.069
where I tell you
you should leave if you want to.

31:37.112 --> 31:38.505
Yeah, well, we're not going to.

31:40.855 --> 31:42.335
Bulshar gave me one gift.

31:43.945 --> 31:47.383
He showed me what I'm...
most afraid of.

31:47.427 --> 31:48.776
What's that?

31:51.561 --> 31:52.606
Losing you.

31:54.477 --> 31:56.001
Well,
we're all coming with you.

31:57.524 --> 31:59.134
-Nah, you're not.
-You drugged us.

32:00.353 --> 32:03.747
-Pretty much, yep.
: You can't...
do this alone, Earp.

32:03.791 --> 32:07.186
There's not enough crypsis
for all of us,
and I'm a coward.

32:07.229 --> 32:08.752
Nicole!

32:08.796 --> 32:10.145
What the hell...?

32:11.712 --> 32:14.584
I can't handle seeing the looks
on your faces if I fail.

32:20.199 --> 32:22.462
Hey! Asshole!

32:22.505 --> 32:24.986
That was a total dick move,
even for you!

32:25.030 --> 32:27.423
You clearly underestimate
the amount of dick I be.

32:27.467 --> 32:29.077
Yeah, well,
I know you better than anyone,

32:29.121 --> 32:32.559
which is why I didn't take a sip
of your dumb drugged whisky!

32:32.602 --> 32:34.648
I didn't drug yours, Waverly.

32:34.691 --> 32:36.693
What

32:38.434 --> 32:39.522
Juan Carlo and Julian.

32:41.046 --> 32:43.396
Two angel guardians
of the garden.
A flaming sword?

32:45.267 --> 32:46.312
And a backup sword.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.707
Looks like old what's-his-name
was all about the alternates.

32:50.751 --> 32:52.883
-Two sisters.
-You and me, kid.

32:54.059 --> 32:55.930
Am I your backup?

32:55.974 --> 33:00.848
Uh... I think we both know
I'm yours... angel.

33:03.416 --> 33:05.026
Mm. What's that smell?

33:06.288 --> 33:08.377
-Eau de crypsis.
-Jeez.

33:08.421 --> 33:11.032
-Jeremy couldn't have added
a pinch of patchouli?
-You gotta put some on too.

33:11.076 --> 33:15.123
Urgh. Gross. Okay.
And we're sure this'll make it
so his beekeepers can't see us?

33:15.167 --> 33:18.779
I'm only sure it smells
like Randy Nedley's hockey bag.

33:18.822 --> 33:20.433
I don't want Nedley to die.

33:20.476 --> 33:23.479
Then let's go stop
the apocalypse
and make sure he doesn't.

33:49.201 --> 33:50.680
Yo, Bushwhacked!

33:54.380 --> 33:56.164
The Earp sisters...

33:57.470 --> 33:59.385
...here to die together.

33:59.428 --> 34:01.778
You're not gonna climb
those stairs, Bulshar.

34:01.822 --> 34:03.563
-Oh, yeah.

34:03.606 --> 34:07.523
-You bested my bees.
-I bested your mom.

34:07.567 --> 34:11.179
-You're ridiculous.
-And you're mortal.
Which means I can kill you.

34:11.223 --> 34:12.311
Come, then.

34:13.355 --> 34:14.922
Okay.

34:26.412 --> 34:28.936
-Wynonna!!
-Ah!!

34:32.635 --> 34:34.289
Don't you get it,
Wynonna Earp?

34:34.333 --> 34:36.378
You're not the heir of
anything anymore.

34:39.903 --> 34:43.820
-Your mom's not the heir
of anything anymore.
-Julian. Juan Carlo.

34:43.864 --> 34:46.258
They used to be so mighty!

34:46.301 --> 34:49.087
I really expected more
from an angel!

34:49.130 --> 34:50.566
: Well,
then you're gonna love this.

34:56.224 --> 34:59.314
!
-You pathetic quim.

34:59.358 --> 35:03.710
Only a hero can wield
the flaming sword
against a demon.

35:03.753 --> 35:07.540
Or heroine.
And only an angel can name one.

35:07.583 --> 35:10.064
My dad taught me that
right before you killed him.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.414
That's impossible.

35:13.981 --> 35:15.113
Wynonna Earp.

35:16.505 --> 35:17.898
You are chosen.

35:20.770 --> 35:21.771
Get it, girl.

35:23.033 --> 35:24.122
Peacemaker.

35:25.775 --> 35:28.213
I can see the stairs!

35:30.563 --> 35:32.782
Also, holy shitballs!

35:41.313 --> 35:43.315
You think you can handle
my sword?

35:43.358 --> 35:45.882
If I had a nickel for every
snake who's asked me that.

35:50.235 --> 35:54.152
You like that, bitch?
I've seen Princess Bride,
like, 70 times.

35:54.195 --> 35:55.762
Ah!

36:00.810 --> 36:03.161
-Wynonna!

36:03.204 --> 36:04.205
I can't get down!

36:04.249 --> 36:06.381
The garden will have her.

36:06.425 --> 36:08.775
Sorry, she's already taken.

36:08.818 --> 36:10.342
Ah!

36:12.866 --> 36:15.129
This is for Waverly's dad!

36:16.261 --> 36:18.437
This is for humanity!

36:20.003 --> 36:21.527
And that's for my family.

36:23.877 --> 36:25.487
We could enter the garden
together.

36:28.098 --> 36:29.274
Rule as one.

36:29.317 --> 36:31.841
No. Consent denied.

36:31.885 --> 36:33.800
Then you will die.

36:33.843 --> 36:35.932
You first.

36:39.501 --> 36:40.850
No!!

36:48.554 --> 36:50.033
Son of a Cobra Kai.

36:51.383 --> 36:52.384
Wynonna!

36:54.081 --> 36:55.952
Wynonna?

36:55.996 --> 36:58.825
Wynonna, let me outta here!

36:58.868 --> 37:01.219
Don't you dare die on me, idiot!

37:01.262 --> 37:02.872
It's okay.

37:04.178 --> 37:05.745
You'll be fine, baby girl.

37:08.748 --> 37:10.315
: No!

37:10.358 --> 37:12.230
No!! No!!

37:39.257 --> 37:40.258
: Where've you been?

37:41.171 --> 37:43.217
You left me handcuffed,

37:43.261 --> 37:46.002
and bound
in a circle of holy water.
Remember?

37:46.046 --> 37:48.004
Excuses, excuses.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.268
You suck.

37:55.925 --> 37:56.926
Thanks.

37:58.014 --> 37:59.799
No, I mean
you sucked out the venom.

38:02.323 --> 38:03.498
How'd I taste?

38:05.892 --> 38:06.936
Heroic.

38:11.201 --> 38:13.378
Waverly!!

38:13.421 --> 38:15.815
Ah!!

38:17.556 --> 38:19.645
Wynonna, you did it.

38:20.646 --> 38:21.951
You killed Bulshar.

38:22.952 --> 38:23.953
My hero.

38:23.997 --> 38:25.738
Don't you dare give up,
baby girl!

38:26.956 --> 38:28.697
-I am tired.
-I'm not.

38:28.741 --> 38:30.699
I'm fresh as a daisy.
Come on, fight, Earp!

38:30.743 --> 38:33.702
-Listen, can you tell Nicole--
-You tell her.

38:33.746 --> 38:36.531
-I can't hold on.
-Please! Please!

38:37.663 --> 38:38.751
But you'll come get me?

38:38.794 --> 38:40.622
-Don't you dare!!!
-Wynonna!

38:40.666 --> 38:43.669
-Please don't leave me alone
in there with that thing!
-No!!

38:45.105 --> 38:47.673
Oh!

38:47.716 --> 38:48.978
I can't get on the stairs!

38:49.022 --> 38:51.372
Wynonna!!! No!!!

39:02.992 --> 39:04.820
