<i>Previously on
"Switched at Birth"...</i>

00:01.760 --> 00:02.969
You took home someone else's baby

00:03.030 --> 00:05.070
<i>And another family took home yours.</i>

00:05.130 --> 00:08.240
Does anybody know where
this other child might be?

00:08.300 --> 00:11.670
I'm so glad you found it.

00:11.740 --> 00:13.580
Nice to meet you.

00:13.640 --> 00:16.410
- Daphne is comfortable being deaf.
- No one likes being deaf.

00:16.480 --> 00:17.780
I don't need you to protect me.

00:17.850 --> 00:19.280
Your mother and i are just trying

00:19.350 --> 00:20.780
- To make this thing right.
- Right for who?

00:20.850 --> 00:22.990
We intend to get an
attorney and get daphne back.

00:23.050 --> 00:24.550
Don't even think about that.

00:24.620 --> 00:27.620
Mom, you know that guest
house that we hardly ever use?

00:27.690 --> 00:29.290
All this space.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.390
You said no rules.

00:31.460 --> 00:33.000
Anything in the house is yours.

00:33.060 --> 00:35.400
Look, i am sure you're about as
thrilled to have me in your backyard

00:35.460 --> 00:36.800
As i am to be here.

01:08.900 --> 01:12.900
Hi. So whenever we have my
parents' biological daughter

01:12.970 --> 01:16.170
And my biological mother and
grandmother living in the guest house,

01:16.240 --> 01:18.340
My mom likes to make some
big, fancy breakfast item

01:18.410 --> 01:20.510
To make her feel like
this is totally normal.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.510
Anyway, she made popovers

01:22.580 --> 01:25.110
And, like, five jams and three juices.

01:25.180 --> 01:27.120
I'm supposed to invite you over.

01:27.180 --> 01:28.980
You get to eat sugar rice pops?

01:29.050 --> 01:30.720
Yeah.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.460
I love popovers!

01:35.520 --> 01:38.730
I'd love to, but i have to go to work.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.030
- Bye.
- Oh.

01:43.300 --> 01:45.570
- You all go ahead.
- I'll bring you one.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.340
What the hell are popovers?

01:52.410 --> 01:54.510
<i>- John:oh hey!
- Hi, come on in.</i>

01:54.580 --> 01:57.080
Can i get you anything- Some
juice or some milk or some tea?

01:57.150 --> 01:58.950
How is it going over there?
It's not too hot, is it?

01:59.010 --> 02:01.150
- Those windows are opening okay?
- You fixed them, right?

02:01.220 --> 02:03.220
Oh my god, guys, hover much?

02:03.290 --> 02:04.920
Everything's great. Thank you.

02:04.990 --> 02:06.920
Here you go.

02:06.990 --> 02:08.919
These are so cute.

02:08.990 --> 02:10.860
Oh yeah, we have kind of a
squirrel thing in this family.

02:10.930 --> 02:13.260
- Yeah, i think i noticed a couple.
- Children: a couple?

02:13.330 --> 02:15.160
When toby was little, he
had this bushel of red hair

02:15.230 --> 02:16.830
On the top of his
head, so i called him...

02:31.780 --> 02:33.750
Daphne, you want to make something?

02:33.820 --> 02:36.390
Cook something?

02:36.450 --> 02:38.850
Yeah, i make these great
butterscotch brownies.

02:38.920 --> 02:41.220
<i>- Aww.
- Bay:oh, she's pretty. Â she's smart.</i>

02:41.290 --> 02:42.830
She bakes. What doesn't she do?

02:42.890 --> 02:44.790
You do lots of things too, honey.

02:44.860 --> 02:47.460
So it's set, right? Thursday
barbecue- You, regina and your grandma?

02:47.530 --> 02:50.170
Here's some rhubarb jam. Some
people don't like it, but i love it.

02:50.230 --> 02:51.800
I make all kinds of rhubarb things.

02:51.870 --> 02:53.670
I make rhubarb syrup, rhubarb pies.

02:53.740 --> 02:55.940
You make the most amazing rhubarb flan.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.080
Mm, is this rhubarb?

03:05.810 --> 03:07.980
I mean, it's really good.

03:08.050 --> 03:09.990
Thank you.

03:11.350 --> 03:14.060
It's kind of like
hanging out with grandpa.

03:16.860 --> 03:19.460
My ride's here, so...

03:21.260 --> 03:23.900
- Oh honey.
- Yeah.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.870
Emmett,
this is my-

03:29.940 --> 03:32.540
I mean, the
people who-

03:32.610 --> 03:34.640
Hi. John kennish. Nice to meet you.

03:34.710 --> 03:36.710
Kathryn.

03:38.610 --> 03:41.880
He says he traded a rookie
mark mcguire for you.

03:41.950 --> 03:43.850
why?

03:43.920 --> 03:45.850
'Cause he was nine.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.920
'Cause he read that you were
cut from your high school team

03:48.990 --> 03:51.290
And you didn't give up.
And he really liked that.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.400
You get an autographed
picture, my friend.

03:53.460 --> 03:57.330
- I happen to have one in my wallet right now.
- Right here.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.000
Toby you've met.

03:59.070 --> 04:01.440
And this is bay.

04:04.070 --> 04:06.180
How long have you two been together?

04:06.240 --> 04:08.940
Oh, no no. We're not
together. We're just friends.

04:09.010 --> 04:11.210
Well, i'm happy to meet you anyway.

04:11.280 --> 04:12.710
Hey, sweetie.

04:12.780 --> 04:15.880
Um, i didn't know you could be so young

04:15.950 --> 04:17.350
And still drive a motorcycle.

04:17.420 --> 04:19.560
You just need to be 16.

04:19.620 --> 04:22.490
Oh wow. I didn't know that.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.860
<i>- Yeah.
- Kathryn:16?</i>

04:24.930 --> 04:27.660
You'd better get going.

04:27.730 --> 04:30.230
<i>John: nice to meet you.</i>

04:34.440 --> 04:37.840
- Bye.
- Okay, what just happened?

04:37.910 --> 04:42.410
I think she just left on a
'66 triumph bonneville t. T.

04:42.480 --> 04:46.580
Oh, so i drink half a beer
and get grounded for a week,

04:46.650 --> 04:48.450
But she gets to whizz around the city

04:48.520 --> 04:50.920
On the back of
the-Friend-Who-You-Just-Met's motorcycle?

04:50.990 --> 04:53.220
- Don't worry. We're gonna fix that.
- You're gonna unground me?

04:53.290 --> 04:54.990
No, but nice try.

04:55.060 --> 04:56.990
Then why does she get
to do whatever she wants?

04:57.060 --> 04:59.390
Okay, you're grounded
because you were arrested.

04:59.460 --> 05:01.630
And you two, off to school. Bye-Bye.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.170
We are gonna do something about that.

05:05.230 --> 05:07.400
Oh, we are definitely gonna fix that.

Oh hey, sweetie. Don't forget,

06:09.400 --> 06:11.710
Tomorrow at 10:00 a. M.

06:11.770 --> 06:14.710
- Do we have to? I see daphne,y time

06:14.770 --> 06:17.310
Every time i think about
i get crazy. Issed out on,

06:17.380 --> 06:20.680
But suing the hospital-
Fix anything?Y gonna

06:20.750 --> 06:22.880
I think we have to other parents

06:22.950 --> 06:25.190
To make sure never happens again.

06:25.250 --> 06:26.750
Come on, just admit it. You're angry.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.220
Yes, i'm angry.

06:28.290 --> 06:30.360
Can you please just
come with me? Please?

06:30.420 --> 06:32.560
I just want her off
that damn motorcycle.

06:32.630 --> 06:35.800
The woman who can make that
happen is 50 yards that way.

06:35.860 --> 06:37.800
So why don't you go ask her?

06:37.860 --> 06:39.600
Can you do it for me?

06:39.670 --> 06:41.800
Huh-Uh. You want it so bad, you do it.

06:44.270 --> 06:46.640
Hey, so what are you doing later?

06:46.710 --> 06:49.310
I'm grounded, but i can
hang out for a little bit

06:49.380 --> 06:51.310
Before i'm locked up at casa de kennish.

06:51.380 --> 06:53.510
- Bay, we're broken up.
- What are you talking about?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.580
"I think we need a
break"- Remember that?

06:55.650 --> 06:57.480
Well, i said "break," not "break up. "

06:57.550 --> 07:00.350
- And now we had
one, so... - Huh-Uh.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.390
I'm tired of being jerked around.

07:03.460 --> 07:05.990
Okay, i'm sorry.

07:06.060 --> 07:07.930
I've had a lot going on lately

07:07.990 --> 07:10.760
And i've been a little bit bipolar.

07:10.830 --> 07:12.270
Okay, more than normal.

07:12.330 --> 07:14.800
You keep saying that-
"I have a lot going on. "

07:14.870 --> 07:17.400
What? What's the big mystery?

07:19.370 --> 07:22.480
There's nothing, is there?

07:22.540 --> 07:24.580
It's just more bay drama.

07:26.310 --> 07:30.080
Yeah, you're right. Just more bay drama.

07:37.820 --> 07:39.960
Hi. I just wanted
to check in-

07:40.030 --> 07:42.460
<i>Oh. Oh.</i>

07:42.530 --> 07:46.800
It's fine. It's completely fine.

07:46.870 --> 07:49.700
Yeah, come on in.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.770
<i>Thank you.</i>

07:53.210 --> 07:56.010
Wow. Wow.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.880
- So emmett seems sweet.
- Yeah, emmet's the best.

08:02.250 --> 08:03.820
And you don't
worry about them-?

08:03.880 --> 08:06.490
Sorry, a client.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.690
So i wanted to tell you

08:12.760 --> 08:14.690
That we barbecue every thursday.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.730
It's a little tradition we have

08:16.800 --> 08:18.600
Since we redid the patio.

08:18.670 --> 08:20.600
And, um, i was just wondering

08:20.670 --> 08:24.400
If you and adriana wanted to join us.

08:24.470 --> 08:27.510
Daphne's gonna bake her
butterscotch brownies.

08:27.570 --> 08:29.310
And it's right out there.

08:29.380 --> 08:31.180
I mean, if you're just home anyway.

08:31.240 --> 08:34.210
It'd be impossible for me not to go.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.220
Great.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.720
I'm gonna take this.

08:38.789 --> 08:40.190
Please do.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.590
Honey.

08:45.630 --> 08:47.390
What's going on?

08:47.460 --> 08:49.560
She's tearing that place
apart- I mean literally.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.400
Ripping the wallpaper off the walls.

08:51.460 --> 08:53.930
Are you having second thoughts?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.940
Yes.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.840
We asked this woman we
barely know to move in.

08:58.910 --> 09:01.040
Maybe we should have
tried some other way

09:01.110 --> 09:04.740
To get to know each other
before sharing patio furniture.

09:04.810 --> 09:07.110
So what do you
want to do-

09:07.180 --> 09:09.150
Undo it?

09:18.290 --> 09:20.330
Hey, do you speak english?

09:22.930 --> 09:24.860
I'm sorry. Duh.

09:24.930 --> 09:27.000
What i mean is, i'm looking for daphne

09:27.070 --> 09:29.070
With a d.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.370
Thanks.

09:38.510 --> 09:40.380
Hi. I'm liam.

09:40.450 --> 09:43.320
<i>We met at buckner. And i
think you were on a tour.</i>

09:43.380 --> 09:45.250
And i thought i might
see you around school.

09:45.320 --> 09:48.560
Yeah, i decided to stay here.

09:48.620 --> 09:50.560
Oh, i swear i'm not a stalker.

09:50.620 --> 09:52.730
I just thought, you know,
you seemed really cool.

09:52.790 --> 09:55.760
And, you know, there's only one
deaf high school in kansas city,

09:55.830 --> 09:57.760
So i figured, you know...

09:57.830 --> 09:59.330
I'm glad you did.

10:06.770 --> 10:10.040
- Your bodyguard?
- Pretty much.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.550
I love that place.

10:12.610 --> 10:14.380
I'm obsessed with their fried zucchini.

10:14.450 --> 10:15.880
That's my dad's restaurant.

10:15.950 --> 10:17.380
Sure.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.890
I'm serious. Forno di lupo. Liam lupo.

10:19.950 --> 10:21.420
Swear to god.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.220
No way. I can't believe that.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.490
Uh-Huh, and in fact
my fried zucchini-

10:25.560 --> 10:27.630
Even better than my dad's.

10:27.690 --> 10:30.230
Wait, that sounded really bad.

10:32.970 --> 10:34.400
Do you seriously cook?

10:34.470 --> 10:36.940
Do i cook? Oh, i will take
you down in the kitchen.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.810
Wait, that also sounded really bad.

10:39.870 --> 10:41.980
What's wrong with me today?

10:42.040 --> 10:45.210
How about this? Do you
want to hang out sometime?

10:45.280 --> 10:47.050
Nice. Nice
style-

10:47.110 --> 10:48.880
Clear, concise...

10:50.120 --> 10:52.290
...to the point.
You've done this before.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.960
One hour, mom. What is
one hour going to matter?

10:59.030 --> 11:01.060
You're grounded, which
means no leaving the house

11:01.130 --> 11:03.230
Except to go to school,
and you know that.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.860
I just wanna go to the art store.

11:04.930 --> 11:07.430
Maybe you should think about
that next time you break the law.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.440
Don't roll your eyes at me.

11:09.500 --> 11:12.040
Really, what's the big deal?

11:12.110 --> 11:14.270
Oh, i know.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.210
You don't want to go to the
art store. You want to see liam.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.380
Oh no, definitely not.

11:19.450 --> 11:22.450
It's four more days. I
think you can handle it.

11:29.260 --> 11:32.560
Hi. So do you remember the
whole it's-Her-Body thing

11:32.630 --> 11:35.860
- You were telling my mom down at the police station?
- Yes.

11:35.930 --> 11:38.830
So my parents grounded me for a week
for the whole fake i. D. Situation,

11:38.900 --> 11:40.970
And i knew you'd have
a much cooler attitude.

11:41.030 --> 11:42.540
Uh-Huh.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.600
I mean, kids have to
make their own mistakes

11:44.670 --> 11:47.440
And be treated like adults
and, you know, be trusted.

11:47.510 --> 11:50.210
And i have a court date, so it's
not like i'm just gonna get off.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.110
What's being stuck here
gonna teach me, you know?

11:52.180 --> 11:54.650
Wait wait wait. Are you telling
me that you are stuck here

11:54.710 --> 11:56.850
- In that house for a whole week...
- Yes.

11:56.920 --> 11:59.050
...with nothing but your
pool, your tennis courts,

11:59.120 --> 12:01.690
Your computer and your art studio?

12:01.760 --> 12:04.090
This is a trick question, isn't it?

12:07.260 --> 12:09.130
Tell you a secret:

12:09.200 --> 12:10.630
If it was me,

12:10.700 --> 12:13.670
I'd have grounded you for a month,

12:13.730 --> 12:15.040
And no screens.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.170
Okay.

12:17.240 --> 12:19.010
Thanks.

12:19.070 --> 12:20.570
You're welcome.

13:01.190 --> 13:03.560
Now there's a girl who
looks like she's dying

13:03.620 --> 13:05.990
To do some serious manual labor.

13:06.060 --> 13:09.190
You actually want me to help you?

13:09.260 --> 13:12.830
Well, i'm gonna have to live
with this color a long time.

13:12.900 --> 13:15.730
I could really use a second opinion.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.470
Please?

13:19.200 --> 13:22.410
Hello? I was just
hoping to borrow a mixer.

13:22.470 --> 13:24.980
Ours is in a box somewhere.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.500
Hey. Argh! Help!

13:43.560 --> 13:45.730
Oh, i'm so sorry! Please don't
tell anyone. I shouldn't have been-

13:45.800 --> 13:47.730
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. It's fine.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.230
Go ahead, poke around, drool.

13:49.300 --> 13:51.400
Just let me know if there's some

13:51.470 --> 13:53.400
Weird cleaver fetish
you have or something.

13:53.470 --> 13:56.440
No, it's just

13:56.510 --> 13:59.980
This is, like,
my dream kitchen-

14:00.040 --> 14:01.580
This whole house.

14:01.650 --> 14:04.250
Yeah, i guess. Mm.

14:04.320 --> 14:07.120
- Hey!
- What?

14:07.190 --> 14:09.420
Don't. That's so gross.

14:09.490 --> 14:11.190
Oh gross?

14:11.260 --> 14:13.120
No, don't you dare, toby. No no no.

14:13.190 --> 14:15.360
Daphne, daphne, is he bothering you?

14:15.430 --> 14:16.690
- Yes.
- No.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.400
Good. He has years of
torturing to make up for.

14:18.460 --> 14:20.060
That's it? You're not gonna help?

14:20.130 --> 14:21.900
It's what big brothers do. See ya.

14:21.970 --> 14:24.270
- This is really good.
- Toby, you give that back to me right now.

14:27.310 --> 14:30.840
Damn, some of this stuff is better than
the permanent collection at the kemper.

14:30.910 --> 14:33.810
Yeah, i've got three
clients who pay me in trade.

14:33.880 --> 14:35.810
It's great for the decor,

14:35.880 --> 14:39.250
Not so great for the pocketbook.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.850
Though this
one i did-

14:41.920 --> 14:43.860
My mexican folk art phase.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.790
I went through one of those.

14:45.860 --> 14:48.190
I can't help it. I'm still
totally obsessed with frida kahlo.

14:48.260 --> 14:52.230
Please, what self-Respecting
latina artist isn't?

14:52.300 --> 14:54.730
"There have been two
accidents in my life-

14:54.800 --> 14:57.000
Diego and the trolley. "

14:57.070 --> 14:59.770
Together: "diego was by far the worst. "

14:59.840 --> 15:03.780
- It's so sad.
- I know.

15:03.840 --> 15:07.250
I guess i'm a latina artist.

15:07.310 --> 15:09.850
You most certainly are.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.450
What are those?

15:14.520 --> 15:16.990
My a. A. Chips.

15:17.060 --> 15:18.960
You earn
them-

15:19.020 --> 15:22.530
24 hours sober, 30 days, six months,

15:22.590 --> 15:24.530
And every year after that.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.200
Could
i- ?

15:26.260 --> 15:28.500
Sure.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.310
Ask me anything you want.

15:38.180 --> 15:41.250
So you were an alcoholic?

15:41.310 --> 15:42.750
No.

15:42.810 --> 15:44.750
I am an alcoholic,

15:44.820 --> 15:46.750
Always will be.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.750
That's why i put them there,

15:48.820 --> 15:50.720
So i can see them and remember

15:50.790 --> 15:52.720
How freakin' hard they were to earn,

15:52.790 --> 15:55.890
Because i'm not going back.

15:55.960 --> 15:59.400
And that's why i would
have been harder on you

15:59.460 --> 16:01.830
For that fake i. D.
Than your parents were.

16:01.900 --> 16:04.400
I don't get it.

16:04.470 --> 16:07.370
You don't have the luxury of
a couple of beers now and then,

16:07.440 --> 16:09.870
Because if you're anything like me,

16:09.940 --> 16:12.610
Pretty quickly that couple of
beers can become a six-Pack,

16:12.680 --> 16:15.010
And then that six-Pack
is all you think about.

16:15.080 --> 16:18.420
It happened to my
dad. It happened to me.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.550
And i'm gonna do everything in my power

16:20.620 --> 16:23.760
To make damn sure it
doesn't happen to you.

16:31.960 --> 16:33.930
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.500
<i>I thought i'd just come
by and drop this stuff off.</i>

16:36.570 --> 16:39.000
Ty, that is so sweet...

16:41.170 --> 16:43.110
Especially considering

16:43.170 --> 16:46.240
It's coupons and a bunch of junk mail.

16:46.310 --> 16:49.610
- Hey.
- Hi again.

16:49.680 --> 16:52.620
You know, i'm gonna run out to the car

16:52.680 --> 16:55.620
And get the rest of the, um, stuff.

16:58.860 --> 17:01.890
So what do you think?

17:01.960 --> 17:04.829
Uh, yeah, it's not my deal,

17:04.900 --> 17:06.700
But, hey, if i ran around

17:06.770 --> 17:09.069
Telling guys i just met
that i was an eggplant,

17:09.130 --> 17:10.900
That's the color i'd
want my walls painted too.

17:10.970 --> 17:13.970
I'm never gonna live that down, am i?

17:15.970 --> 17:18.910
So how much are daphne and regina
paying for this place anyway?

17:18.980 --> 17:21.510
<i>Nada. Again with the...</i>

17:21.579 --> 17:23.650
Mysterious long story?

17:23.720 --> 17:25.579
Kind of.

17:25.650 --> 17:27.420
Well, you know, if there is another

17:27.490 --> 17:29.290
Three-Bedroom guest
house here on the property

17:29.350 --> 17:31.420
That you guys are just handing
out to random strangers,

17:31.490 --> 17:33.490
- Go ahead and put my name on the list.
- Will do.

17:33.560 --> 17:36.830
Hey, quick question: are you
gonna be stopping by daily

17:36.900 --> 17:39.230
To drop off regina's
mail or just popping by

17:39.300 --> 17:41.230
To, i don't know, hang up pictures?

17:41.300 --> 17:43.400
I was- I was
passing by.

17:43.470 --> 17:45.400
Oh, you were passing by
mission hills? Really?

17:45.470 --> 17:47.070
Yeah, and i thought they could use...

17:47.140 --> 17:49.240
Their 20ÃÂ¢ off coupon for jell-O.

17:49.310 --> 17:51.240
- It's 75ÃÂ¢ off.
- Oh.

17:51.310 --> 17:52.810
All right? It all adds up.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.750
Not that you would know
anything about that.

17:54.810 --> 17:56.250
Oh no, wait.

17:56.310 --> 17:58.020
What if they need you
to move some furniture?

17:58.080 --> 17:59.580
Bye, eggplant.

17:59.650 --> 18:01.890
Or kill a spider? You're so helpful.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.290
So it's like an
open-And-Shut case, right?

18:05.360 --> 18:07.060
Well, there's no question
they were negligent.

18:07.130 --> 18:10.230
And you're entitled to recovery
for the emotional distress

18:10.300 --> 18:13.500
Of being denied the opportunity
to raise your real daughter.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.570
I think they say "biological. "

18:15.630 --> 18:18.740
Right. The hospital wants
this to go away quietly.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.740
Great. That's exactly what we want.

18:20.810 --> 18:22.970
We wanna put this behind
us and focus on the girls.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.280
Good, because the cases i've seen

18:25.340 --> 18:27.750
Where the different sides
pursue separate lawsuits,

18:27.810 --> 18:30.120
Pointing the finger at how
the other kid was raised-

18:30.180 --> 18:32.520
It always turns into a bloodbath.

18:35.850 --> 18:37.790
And then you hit the igniter.

18:37.860 --> 18:39.920
But do not lean over to see
if the igniter is working,

18:39.990 --> 18:42.560
Because poof! You'll singe
off all your facial hair.

18:42.630 --> 18:44.500
I've done it. It's not pretty.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.330
<i>I have a big secret for you here.</i>

18:46.400 --> 18:48.370
I know you're vegetarian,
but someday you might be

18:48.430 --> 18:51.300
Cooking for some guy. You never know.

18:51.370 --> 18:53.970
- You know.
- Honey...

18:55.210 --> 18:58.440
I- I'd like to get this
whole motorcycle thing,

18:58.510 --> 19:00.610
You know, figured out before dinner.

19:00.680 --> 19:03.650
So what do you think?
Should we talk to her now?

19:06.350 --> 19:08.020
Hey, regina. Can i help you with that?

19:08.090 --> 19:09.550
Oh no, i'm good.

19:09.620 --> 19:11.160
<i>Hey, listen, you have a second?</i>

19:11.220 --> 19:12.720
Is there a problem?

19:12.790 --> 19:15.230
No no no, we just wanted you to know

19:15.290 --> 19:18.230
That we spoke with an attorney about
that lawsuit against the hospital.

19:18.300 --> 19:20.900
And we didn't know what
you were planning on doing,

19:20.970 --> 19:23.500
But she said that if
we all go in together,

19:23.570 --> 19:25.140
We have a much stronger case.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.210
Okay, thanks. I'll think about it.

19:28.270 --> 19:31.310
Oh, and another thing
i wanted to mention:

19:31.380 --> 19:34.810
Daphne's school is right
near my pilates class,

19:34.880 --> 19:37.480
So i'd be happy to drop
her off every morning.

19:37.550 --> 19:39.580
Oh, that's okay. She
rides with emmett...

19:41.420 --> 19:44.190
Which you know.

19:44.260 --> 19:46.720
Regina, a motorcycle?

19:46.790 --> 19:48.230
Come on.

19:48.290 --> 19:50.460
Come on?

19:50.530 --> 19:53.200
You bought your son a $30,000 car

19:53.260 --> 19:56.400
Even though teenage boys
are notoriously reckless.

19:56.470 --> 19:57.900
We are talking about daphne.

19:57.970 --> 19:59.900
You're questioning my
judgment as a parent.

19:59.970 --> 20:02.940
- I think i can comment on yours.
- Nobody's attacking anybody.

20:03.010 --> 20:05.280
Plus, i guarantee you emmett
is a more careful driver

20:05.340 --> 20:07.480
On that motorcycle than
half the idiots out there

20:07.550 --> 20:09.250
Texting and putting on lipstick.

20:09.310 --> 20:10.980
He's deaf.

20:11.980 --> 20:13.820
And?

20:13.890 --> 20:16.820
What if an ambulance goes by?

20:16.890 --> 20:18.920
What if someone honks at him?

20:18.990 --> 20:22.590
Maybe he should just be locked
up at home like all deaf people.

20:22.660 --> 20:24.660
Regina, come on. It's a valid question.

20:24.730 --> 20:27.200
We are offering to drive her.

20:27.270 --> 20:28.930
We are not asking you to.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.870
And the reason i don't drive her
is because i work for a living.

20:31.940 --> 20:33.570
What is that supposed to mean?

20:33.640 --> 20:35.440
Hey, guys,

20:35.510 --> 20:36.880
Dinner's ready.

20:48.960 --> 20:53.030
well,
let's get this started.

20:53.100 --> 20:56.130
Don't you say grace?

20:56.200 --> 20:58.300
No, we're atheists.

20:59.500 --> 21:02.370
You're atheist. I'm agnostic.

21:02.440 --> 21:05.110
Whatever. We don't thank god

21:05.180 --> 21:07.110
For our salmon and asparagus.

21:07.180 --> 21:09.650
But you all go right ahead.

21:12.350 --> 21:15.620
- Well...
- Can i do it?

21:15.690 --> 21:17.620
<i>- Please. That'd be great.
- Kathryn:oh.</i>

21:17.690 --> 21:19.260
<i>John: of course.</i>

21:19.320 --> 21:22.390
Do we hold hands or something?

21:22.460 --> 21:24.360
Any way you'd like would be great.

21:29.470 --> 21:31.640
Great.

21:37.570 --> 21:40.580
I want to give thanks for the food,

21:40.640 --> 21:42.580
For our new house

21:42.650 --> 21:45.750
And for the circumstances,
however crazy,

21:45.820 --> 21:48.720
That brought us all together.

21:50.020 --> 21:53.460
- Amen.
- Others: amen.

21:53.520 --> 21:56.660
Daphne, i was thinking it would be nice

21:56.730 --> 21:58.900
For us to spend some time together

21:58.960 --> 22:01.460
And i was wondering if i could drive you

22:01.530 --> 22:04.630
<i>To school every morning.</i>

22:04.700 --> 22:05.870
Uh...

22:05.940 --> 22:08.200
You don't have to sugarcoat it for her.

22:08.270 --> 22:11.210
She thinks i'm a terrible mother
for letting you ride with emmett.

22:11.270 --> 22:13.140
Wait a second. We never said that.

22:13.210 --> 22:15.750
Oh please, that's exactly what you said.

22:15.810 --> 22:19.220
There have to be some things that are
open to discussion between the three of us.

22:19.280 --> 22:22.620
Why? You didn't discuss
bay's punishment with me.

22:22.690 --> 22:24.090
Is there something you
want to say about it?

22:24.150 --> 22:26.160
No, i'll take the week grounding.

22:26.220 --> 22:29.130
And what are the things
that are open for discussion?

22:29.190 --> 22:32.300
Their allowance? Their curfew?

22:32.360 --> 22:33.800
I bet you don't even
have a curfew, do you?

22:33.860 --> 22:36.300
Who their friends are? What
they're allowed to wear?

22:36.370 --> 22:38.030
<i>I mean, where does it end?</i>

22:38.100 --> 22:40.600
And i'm betting you two get
to pick which subject it is

22:40.670 --> 22:43.610
<i>- We'll decide by committee. Am i right?
- Regina,Â ya!</i>

22:43.670 --> 22:45.540
Is there something in
particular that is bothering you?

22:45.610 --> 22:47.540
Well, there's
a lot actually-

22:47.610 --> 22:51.550
The way you two throw money around,
for one; the sheer number of toys

22:51.620 --> 22:53.780
- These kids have.
- This is not gonna end well for us.

22:53.850 --> 22:55.850
I'm not throwing any money
around. I earned that money.

22:55.920 --> 22:57.720
But they didn't.

23:01.160 --> 23:03.390
What is she saying? What is she saying?

23:03.460 --> 23:05.030
- I don't know what she's saying.
- I'm saying

23:05.100 --> 23:07.200
She likes riding with emmett.

23:07.260 --> 23:10.830
Of course she does. But
you happen to be the parent.

23:10.900 --> 23:13.870
- Exactly.
- And now all three of us are parenting together.

23:13.940 --> 23:17.210
All of this over a bike. It's not
like i'm handing her a shotgun.

23:17.270 --> 23:18.910
It'd be a hell of a lot safer.

23:18.980 --> 23:22.580
Don't you tell me there
are guns in this house.

23:22.650 --> 23:24.750
It's the second amendment
to the constitution.

23:24.810 --> 23:26.450
- Oh my god.
- Mom.

23:31.220 --> 23:32.920
Excuse me.

23:39.330 --> 23:41.570
Excuse me.

23:42.570 --> 23:44.770
Daphne.

23:49.740 --> 23:51.910
- You're ruining everything!
- Me?

23:51.980 --> 23:55.080
This is hard for everyone. Why
can't you just make the best of it?

23:55.150 --> 23:58.010
Those people are not
who you think they are.

23:58.080 --> 23:59.980
What does that mean?

24:00.050 --> 24:03.420
You want to know what they said to me?

24:03.490 --> 24:05.420
They don't think deaf people

24:05.490 --> 24:08.430
Should be able to drive.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.130
I don't believe you.

24:10.190 --> 24:12.300
Go ask them. Go.

24:12.360 --> 24:15.630
Why do you hate them so much? Is
it because they have more money?

24:15.700 --> 24:18.500
Is it because she's always so
chipper? What's so terrible about them?

24:18.570 --> 24:21.810
They're arrogant and entitled.

24:23.310 --> 24:25.340
We're leaving?

24:26.980 --> 24:28.610
That's it? I have no say in this?

24:28.680 --> 24:30.910
Are you gonna stand there and tell me

24:30.980 --> 24:33.780
That you think that this is working?

24:36.620 --> 24:40.490
I'm going out. Don't wait up.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.830
That woman has a lot of
nerve to sit out there

24:42.890 --> 24:45.330
In our backyard in judgment of us

24:45.400 --> 24:48.270
- When we have done nothing but welcome her.
- Oh, mom, please.

24:48.330 --> 24:50.500
True. Talk about ungrateful.

24:50.570 --> 24:52.870
Yeah, 'cause having her move into
the guest house that we never use

24:52.940 --> 24:54.670
Was such a huge sacrifice.

24:54.740 --> 24:57.610
I do not like the way she talked
to us. I do not like her temper.

24:57.670 --> 25:01.180
- You just don't like her.
- No, i do not.

25:04.450 --> 25:06.150
Okay, what did i do?

25:06.220 --> 25:09.050
She's my blood.

25:09.120 --> 25:12.260
I'm linked to her in a
million different ways

25:12.320 --> 25:13.920
That i don't even understand yet,

25:13.990 --> 25:17.830
So if you hate her, maybe
you kind of hate me too.

25:19.430 --> 25:21.970
Honey, that's not what i meant.

25:36.020 --> 25:38.850
Hey, i'm going out.

25:38.920 --> 25:41.020
Could you cover for me?

25:41.090 --> 25:43.020
Are you okay?

25:43.090 --> 25:45.360
I just need some air.

25:50.330 --> 25:52.130
Regina.

25:52.200 --> 25:56.200
Daphne already yelled at me.

26:01.580 --> 26:04.250
What if i can't do this?

26:04.310 --> 26:06.310
You taught your deaf daughter

26:06.380 --> 26:07.950
To believe she can be president,

26:08.020 --> 26:09.950
But you can't handle living
next to the kennishes?

26:10.020 --> 26:13.590
Daphne is mine. I've done
a damn good job with her.

26:13.650 --> 26:15.590
You certainly have.

26:15.660 --> 26:17.630
I don't want to share her.

26:17.690 --> 26:20.800
I have never had to
ask anyone's permission

26:20.860 --> 26:23.460
On how to raise her,
and i don't like it.

26:23.530 --> 26:24.930
And let's face it,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.300
They have so much
more to offer her-

26:27.370 --> 26:29.840
A dad, a brother, that house.

26:29.900 --> 26:33.240
- That's not true.
- It is true.

26:33.310 --> 26:35.340
I feel like i have to
defend my territory,

26:35.410 --> 26:38.610
As stupid as that sounds.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.780
It's not stupid.

26:51.630 --> 26:53.130
I need a lookout.

26:53.190 --> 26:55.160
- A what?
- I'm putting a poster up.

26:55.230 --> 26:58.800
I need someone to keep an eye
out, make sure no cops are coming.

26:58.870 --> 27:01.740
- A lookout?
- Yeah.

27:01.800 --> 27:03.840
You know, that's even worse than

27:03.900 --> 27:05.970
"I stopped by to drop off the mail. "

27:06.040 --> 27:08.710
come on.

27:14.150 --> 27:15.750
Except that you like fried zucchini

27:15.820 --> 27:17.350
And you have a personal bodyguard,

27:17.420 --> 27:18.950
I don't know anything about you.

27:19.020 --> 27:22.020
You know that i like
nicki minaj and rye rye.

27:22.090 --> 27:24.330
Come on, i want to
know everything-

27:24.390 --> 27:27.400
Where you live, how many
brothers and sisters you have.

27:27.460 --> 27:30.000
You know what would be really awesome?

27:30.060 --> 27:32.630
If we could just talk about music,

27:32.700 --> 27:35.770
Nothing serious, nothing personal.

27:36.900 --> 27:39.540
Okay. What do you
think of the neon trees?

27:39.610 --> 27:42.410
You want my knees on cheese?

27:42.480 --> 27:44.410
No, the neon trees.

27:44.480 --> 27:46.410
- The neon trees.
- Yeah.

27:48.980 --> 27:50.950
So lip-Reading-
Not an exact science?

27:51.020 --> 27:54.620
Hardly. But it gets
easier when i know someone.

27:54.690 --> 27:58.260
I learn the mouth, the way
the lips form certain words.

27:58.330 --> 28:00.130
So you're an expert on my lips?

28:00.190 --> 28:03.560
Not yet.

28:03.630 --> 28:05.730
Do you ever spy on people

28:05.800 --> 28:08.470
Like across the room and
eavesdrop on what they're saying?

28:08.540 --> 28:11.210
Oh, you're so not getting this.

28:13.270 --> 28:15.610
- I have an idea.
- Okay.

28:18.110 --> 28:23.750
Okay, so this has to go up there.

28:23.820 --> 28:25.720
You're allowed to cover them up?

28:25.790 --> 28:28.420
Not the mural. There's sort of
an unspoken rule about those.

28:28.490 --> 28:31.630
Posters can be covered up if
they're coming apart already.

28:31.690 --> 28:33.890
Ideally if you work on a space

28:33.960 --> 28:36.660
Someone's already tagged, you answer it.

28:36.730 --> 28:38.670
Here, hold this.

28:38.730 --> 28:41.470
It's kind of like these two.

28:41.540 --> 28:44.210
See, it looks like this
guy is shooting him.

28:46.810 --> 28:49.480
But clearly they're done
by two different artists.

28:50.910 --> 28:53.810
I love that guy's work.
I've never met him,

28:53.880 --> 28:57.590
But he always uses a
lot of masks and helmets.

28:57.650 --> 29:00.350
Stuff about conformity-
It's totally inspiring.

29:01.690 --> 29:04.660
Anyways, let's stir some goop.

29:04.730 --> 29:06.690
All right.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.670
You know, this is the strangest
first date i've ever been on.

29:21.110 --> 29:23.840
So what's with the axe girl anyway?

29:23.910 --> 29:25.310
What do you mean?

29:25.380 --> 29:27.580
What's she so angry about?

29:29.450 --> 29:31.390
You really want to know?

29:31.450 --> 29:33.450
Absolutely.

29:34.620 --> 29:37.220
<i>Ready?</i>

29:37.290 --> 29:39.130
Bring it on.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.830
<i>- Ã¢Âª it's so much fun... Ã¢Âª
- I eat toenails?</i>

29:48.540 --> 29:50.140
Hi-

29:50.200 --> 29:51.470
I like no nuts.

29:51.540 --> 29:52.970
- Yes! Totally.
- Yeah!

29:53.040 --> 29:54.540
No.

29:54.610 --> 29:57.010
<i>- I said, "i like donuts. "
- Oh!</i>

29:57.080 --> 29:59.710
Dude, this is hard. I
have no idea how you do it.

29:59.780 --> 30:02.620
See, that's why i never hang out
with hearing guys- Too much headache.

30:02.680 --> 30:04.850
You know why i don't
hang out with deaf girls?

30:04.920 --> 30:06.590
Because you've never met one before.

30:06.650 --> 30:09.820
That's exactly right.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.490
What if we were wrong?

30:13.560 --> 30:15.500
Wrong about what?

30:15.560 --> 30:17.970
About having a say over daphne.

30:18.030 --> 30:21.370
<i>Sure, she's our blood.
What does that count for?</i>

30:21.440 --> 30:24.740
We're not royalty.

30:24.810 --> 30:27.810
We raised bay. She's
our child, but daphne-

30:27.880 --> 30:29.640
Wait, sweetie, hold on.

30:29.710 --> 30:31.610
Did i miss something?

30:31.680 --> 30:33.850
Did something just happen?

30:33.910 --> 30:36.050
Bay started defending regina

30:36.120 --> 30:39.290
And it got me to thinking.

30:39.350 --> 30:41.620
I get why she's so pissed.

30:41.690 --> 30:43.960
Suddenly she has to defend
her parenting choices

30:44.020 --> 30:45.960
To complete strangers.

30:46.030 --> 30:50.300
Yeah. I mean, we have to set
some kind of precedent here.

30:50.360 --> 30:53.800
I just don't think
this is the right way.

30:53.870 --> 30:57.100
Well, look, obviously this
arrangement is not working,

30:57.170 --> 31:00.510
So my suggestion is that we get a
family attorney to draw up documents

31:00.570 --> 31:03.310
Giving us the legal authority to
make decisions on daphne's behalf-

31:03.380 --> 31:05.410
You know how this is gonna end up?

31:05.480 --> 31:07.450
Some horrible custody
battle like my parents had.

31:07.520 --> 31:09.280
I'm not doing that to those two girls.

31:09.350 --> 31:11.290
So what do we do? Just let regina do

31:11.350 --> 31:14.120
Whatever the hell she wants to do?

31:14.190 --> 31:16.790
She's done a really good job,

31:16.860 --> 31:21.130
Especially considering everything
that she's had to deal with.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.960
If you had had to raise a deaf child

31:24.030 --> 31:26.870
The way that regina has,

31:26.930 --> 31:30.400
You would have done just as good a job.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.840
- Thank you.
- But we're not gonna give up.

31:34.910 --> 31:37.410
No way.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.250
- Who buys those things?
- Records?

31:39.310 --> 31:40.920
- Yeah.
- Nobody i know.

31:40.980 --> 31:42.950
- Daphne: i don't know anybody either.
- Yo, what up?

31:43.020 --> 31:46.620
- What's up, guys?
- What's happening, man?

31:46.690 --> 31:48.620
Guys, guys, guys, this is daphne.

31:48.690 --> 31:50.620
Daphne, this is cheves and burf.

31:50.690 --> 31:52.960
- Hi.
- Oh, you got something in your ear.

31:53.030 --> 31:55.130
It's a hearing aid. I'm deaf.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.800
you're what?

31:56.860 --> 31:58.870
Wow, this guy is hilarious.

31:58.930 --> 32:01.740
Hey, man, nice going- Taking
a deaf girl to a music store.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.640
<i>Genius, yeah.</i>

32:03.700 --> 32:06.840
- Hey, so do you do that stuff, you know?
- Yep, i do.

32:06.910 --> 32:08.710
You know, you talk really good,

32:08.780 --> 32:11.010
'Cause there was this deaf kid in
our school when we were little, yeah,

32:11.080 --> 32:14.550
And he used to talk like,
"hello, my name is-"

32:14.620 --> 32:17.120
Dude, seriously.
Seriously, huh-Uh, don't.

32:17.180 --> 32:19.220
- Both: what?
- Come on, man,

32:19.290 --> 32:20.890
We're just playing. She's
cool. She knows that.

32:20.960 --> 32:23.090
So show us how to say
something. Like how do you say

32:23.160 --> 32:24.990
- "Doing the nasty"?
- Dude, really.

32:25.060 --> 32:27.860
What? I want to learn how
to love up a deaf chick too.

32:29.060 --> 32:31.630
Is it like- Something
like this, right?

32:31.700 --> 32:33.970
Actually it's like this.

32:34.040 --> 32:36.640
- Oh, like that?
- Exactly.

32:36.700 --> 32:38.310
<i>- So just-? -
Liam:no, dude.</i>

32:38.370 --> 32:40.640
- Keep doing that.
- I'm doing that.

32:40.710 --> 32:42.710
I'ma do that to a girl
when i go to the club.

32:42.780 --> 32:44.710
Liam: how about y'all just cut it out?

32:44.780 --> 32:47.310
It's my friend. I gotta
run. See you later, liam.

32:47.380 --> 32:49.280
- Where are you going?
- Don't go.

32:49.350 --> 32:52.450
- Daph.
- She can't even hear me right now.

32:57.860 --> 33:00.960
- We rock.
- Yeah, we do.

33:01.030 --> 33:03.630
All right, i gotta work in the morning

33:03.700 --> 33:05.330
And you should probably get home.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.970
Bleh, home.

33:07.030 --> 33:09.840
"Oh, i'm so bummed i have
to go back to my mansion. "

33:09.900 --> 33:12.640
- Oh, shut up.
- No, look, you don't get to complain.

33:12.710 --> 33:15.910
Did i or did i not just
spend the last 45 minutes

33:15.980 --> 33:18.950
Telling you the
insanity that is my life?

33:19.010 --> 33:21.850
Come here.

33:21.920 --> 33:24.550
You have three parents
fighting over you.

33:24.620 --> 33:27.050
That's three more than i have.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.320
Yeah, i
know. I-

33:31.030 --> 33:33.060
Why did this have to happen?

33:33.130 --> 33:37.470
Why couldn't i just
be like everyone else?

33:37.530 --> 33:40.900
Well, then what would
you have to paint about?

33:42.570 --> 33:45.810
You really do listen to me.

33:45.870 --> 33:48.440
Yeah, i really listen.

33:48.510 --> 33:51.550
And you know what? If this
whole thing hadn't happened,

33:51.610 --> 33:53.550
We never would have met.

35:13.500 --> 35:15.170
I thought you were grounded.

35:15.230 --> 35:17.070
I am.

35:17.140 --> 35:20.410
So that was a fun dinner.

35:20.470 --> 35:23.980
Yeah, i don't really think
our parents dig each other.

35:25.810 --> 35:29.080
Maybe this whole thing
was just a bad idea.

35:31.050 --> 35:34.520
I really thought we'd be
this big, happy family.

35:35.820 --> 35:39.630
Wow, you really are that girl.

35:39.690 --> 35:44.330
Uh, i didn't think it
was going to be easy,

35:44.400 --> 35:47.230
But i definitely didn't think
it would blow up this fast.

35:47.300 --> 35:50.240
Yeah, that's
my mom-

35:50.300 --> 35:53.010
<i>Ourmom.</i>

35:55.810 --> 35:58.310
This is never gonna stop being weird.

36:01.980 --> 36:04.580
Good night.

36:04.650 --> 36:06.390
'Night.

36:26.810 --> 36:28.510
Oops.

36:28.570 --> 36:31.040
Big oops.

36:31.110 --> 36:34.050
The front door beeps.
The window doesn't.

36:34.110 --> 36:37.550
And i was kind of thinking
you would be asleep by now.

36:37.620 --> 36:38.920
Bay-

36:38.990 --> 36:41.850
I wasn't doing anything immoral

36:41.920 --> 36:44.090
Or illegal or dangerous.

36:44.160 --> 36:47.390
I just needed to get out of this
house. That whole dinner was-

36:47.460 --> 36:50.800
Was a complete disaster. I know.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.900
I know this whole thing is my fault.

36:52.970 --> 36:55.670
Excuse me? How could this be your fault?

36:55.740 --> 36:58.070
You were, like, nine hours
old when all this happened.

36:58.140 --> 37:00.410
But i made you take the d. N.A. Tests

37:00.470 --> 37:02.210
And i made you let them move in.

37:02.280 --> 37:05.410
I keep pushing for everybody to
do all these things, daphne too,

37:05.480 --> 37:10.320
And maybe it's just not in the cards.

37:10.380 --> 37:14.290
We both really wanted this to work.

37:14.350 --> 37:16.420
But if you and mom and regina can't,

37:16.490 --> 37:18.830
We're just gonna have to live with that.

37:21.190 --> 37:23.130
Every single thing they say

37:23.200 --> 37:25.330
About daughters having their fathers

37:25.400 --> 37:28.670
Wrapped around their
little fingers-

37:28.740 --> 37:31.540
Absolutely true.

37:31.600 --> 37:35.310
Do not tell your mother i
caught you. Get upstairs.

37:40.880 --> 37:43.750
- Come here.
- I'm okay.

37:43.820 --> 37:46.220
Well, i'm not. Come.

37:56.900 --> 37:59.170
We never used to fight.

37:59.230 --> 38:01.430
I know.

38:01.500 --> 38:03.970
This is harder than
i thought it would be.

38:05.810 --> 38:07.740
I'm sorry.

38:07.810 --> 38:10.540
I'll stop being so difficult.

38:10.610 --> 38:12.550
I promise.

38:12.610 --> 38:15.980
It's not just you, but thank you.

38:16.050 --> 38:19.150
You are being difficult.

38:19.220 --> 38:22.820
Did they really say that
about deaf people driving?

38:22.890 --> 38:25.630
you know what, honey?

38:25.690 --> 38:28.090
Before i was educated about all this,

38:28.160 --> 38:30.760
I might have said the same thing.

38:30.830 --> 38:34.770
We just have to teach them.

38:36.070 --> 38:40.510
You have to teach them,

38:40.570 --> 38:43.340
Not just tell them
what they want to hear.

38:43.410 --> 38:45.450
Hmm?

38:49.320 --> 38:51.320
Come here.

38:57.660 --> 39:00.260
Hey, come in.

39:01.330 --> 39:04.260
- Hi.
- Please please, come in.

39:04.330 --> 39:08.840
It's so funny. I was gonna
come over myself this morning.

39:08.900 --> 39:10.900
Um...

39:10.970 --> 39:14.540
I caught bay sneaking in
at midnight last night.

39:14.610 --> 39:17.080
You know, so i'm thinking

39:17.140 --> 39:18.910
If i can't control one teenage girl,

39:18.980 --> 39:20.910
How the hell am i
supposed to control two?

39:20.980 --> 39:22.250
- Right?
- Yeah.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.250
- Honey.
- Yeah?

39:24.320 --> 39:27.290
Um, sorry for just barging in.

39:27.350 --> 39:29.760
I wanted to tell you something.

39:29.820 --> 39:33.390
I resisted letting her get
on that thing for months too,

39:33.460 --> 39:35.760
But she begged me.

39:35.830 --> 39:38.900
And, well,
finally-

39:38.970 --> 39:40.900
They're just such good kids.

39:40.970 --> 39:44.240
And i still secretly
followed them for a week.

39:44.300 --> 39:47.710
He's a really good driver, i swear.

39:47.770 --> 39:52.910
The funny thing is for years i wished

39:52.980 --> 39:55.650
That there was someone around
to bounce this stuff off of.

39:55.720 --> 39:58.950
And now there is.

39:59.020 --> 40:01.420
- And...
- It's hard.

40:01.490 --> 40:03.660
It's gonna be
so crowded- Oh.

40:03.720 --> 40:05.660
Toby, back away slowly.

40:05.730 --> 40:08.960
is it safe?

40:09.030 --> 40:11.830
No one's killed each other yet.

40:11.900 --> 40:13.400
Come on in.

40:13.470 --> 40:16.800
I need to tell you guys something.

40:18.640 --> 40:20.870
I speak really well,

40:20.940 --> 40:22.880
So sometimes hearing people forget

40:22.940 --> 40:26.380
Or don't really
understand-

40:26.450 --> 40:28.950
Nothing.

40:29.020 --> 40:31.620
So i need you to speak slower,

40:31.680 --> 40:33.720
<i>Look at me when you talk</i>

40:33.790 --> 40:35.760
And be patient.

40:35.820 --> 40:39.360
- Absolutely. We can-
Yeah. - Sure, why not?

40:39.430 --> 40:41.430
I'm sorry.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.230
It's okay.

40:48.300 --> 40:51.900
And this is a sign for "squirrel. "

40:51.970 --> 40:55.310
- Squirrel.
- Cute. I like it.

40:56.710 --> 41:00.610
Oh, the- Your
friend is-

41:00.680 --> 41:03.050
- So everyone's okay with this?
- Don't ask. Just go.

41:03.120 --> 41:05.750
Actually, i'm not okay with it.

41:05.820 --> 41:08.790
I- I'm
sorry.

41:08.860 --> 41:11.260
I wanted to be okay with it. I'm trying.

41:11.320 --> 41:13.260
But i'm just not.

41:13.330 --> 41:16.460
I wouldn't let my other kids
go on a motorcycle and i can't-

41:16.530 --> 41:19.870
But she's not your kid.

41:19.930 --> 41:21.870
She's mine.

41:21.930 --> 41:25.470
And i don't have a say
in how bay is raised.

41:26.770 --> 41:28.910
We agreed to move in together

41:28.980 --> 41:32.010
So we could get to
know each other's girls,

41:32.080 --> 41:35.380
Not co-Parent them.

41:36.980 --> 41:39.990
Well, regina, that's not how we saw it.

41:42.290 --> 41:43.790
But okay.

41:43.860 --> 41:45.660
Okay.

41:46.960 --> 41:48.290
Sorry.

41:48.360 --> 41:50.130
It's okay.

41:50.200 --> 41:51.760
Bye.

41:51.830 --> 41:53.400
- We should go too.
- Yeah.

41:53.470 --> 41:55.000
Have fun.

41:55.070 --> 41:57.900
One more thing:

41:57.970 --> 42:00.940
I'm not interested in
pursuing that lawsuit.

42:02.310 --> 42:03.910
I don't think you understand.

42:03.980 --> 42:05.650
The lawyer works on a contingency,

42:05.710 --> 42:07.510
Which means that we don't
have to pay any money.

42:07.580 --> 42:10.080
I understand perfectly. I'm
just not one of those people

42:10.150 --> 42:12.420
That sues someone when they
spill hot coffee on themselves.

42:12.490 --> 42:14.420
But we're not talking about hot coffee.

42:14.490 --> 42:16.460
We're talking about kids.

42:16.520 --> 42:18.590
We have to protect other parents,

42:18.660 --> 42:20.390
Make sure that the
hospital doesn't-

42:20.460 --> 42:22.330
I don't think that's my job.

42:22.400 --> 42:25.500
But the money could
be so helpful-

42:25.570 --> 42:27.830
I'm not interested.

42:27.900 --> 42:29.900
- Okay?
- Okay.

42:29.970 --> 42:32.140
- I'll see you all later.
- Yeah, see you.

42:40.080 --> 42:42.010
She needs that money.

42:42.080 --> 42:44.720
I mean, she deserves that money.

42:44.780 --> 42:46.955
She's hiding something.

42:46.990 --> 42:51.361
