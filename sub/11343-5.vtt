'In the criminal justice system,

00:03.297 --> 00:06.767
'sexually based offences
are considered especially heinous.

'In New York City, the detectives

00:27.177 --> 00:30.487
Elliot Stabler, Sex Crimes. What happened?

00:30.537 --> 00:33.893
Vic is a Richard F Schiller, 42.

00:43.937 --> 00:47.771
- First time?
- Who the hell is that?

00:47.817 --> 00:51.412
Mrs Hayes, that's my partner,
Detective Stabler.

00:53.097 --> 00:56.612
- Welcome to my house.
- You all right?

00:58.417 --> 01:01.295
- She found the body.
- Wife, girlfriend, what?

01:01.337 --> 01:05.046
Landlord. She lives here
with her daughter, Virginia.

01:05.096 --> 01:08.055
- Where's the daughter?
- She's out.

01:08.097 --> 01:10.531
He was the best tenant.

01:10.577 --> 01:14.411
Clean. Quiet.
Always paid on time, early, even.

01:14.457 --> 01:17.290
Take Mrs Hayes downstairs.

01:17.337 --> 01:22.730
I'm here! Don't talk to me like
I'm not here. I'm not going anywhere.

01:22.777 --> 01:26.167
Actually, Mrs Hayes,
I could really use a cup of coffee.

01:30.457 --> 01:32.925
Anyone know what this guy's story is?

01:32.977 --> 01:35.616
He was a writer, according to the landlady.

01:36.937 --> 01:39.087
A writer, huh?

01:39.137 --> 01:42.129
Travel book, according to the landlady.

01:46.377 --> 01:49.767
Looks like he choked on his own words.

02:37.217 --> 02:39.970
Vietnam, Bosnia and Peru.

02:40.017 --> 02:43.851
- I heard Kosovo's beautiful.
- Look at this.

02:45.577 --> 02:50.014
It's good to know the macho
Hemingway ideal isn't entirely dead.

02:50.057 --> 02:53.288
- No. Still as toxic.
- On Schiller's last trip

02:53.337 --> 02:56.886
he rode his motorcycle
through a Chiapas uprising.

02:56.937 --> 03:00.612
That narrows down the reasons
for killing this accidental tourist.

03:00.657 --> 03:04.411
He could have been running drugs
or written the wrong thing.

03:04.457 --> 03:09.577
Don't think so.
'It was not the destination but the journey.'

03:09.617 --> 03:13.929
'It is the drive to keep moving
forward that propels me.'

03:13.977 --> 03:18.653
- One adverb shy of Robert James Waller.
- The Bridges Of Madison County?

03:18.697 --> 03:21.814
- That was incredible.
- How about incredibly banal?

03:21.857 --> 03:25.566
Short, muscular sentences
displaying absence of original thinking.

03:25.617 --> 03:29.053
- I was talking about the movie.
- What've you got?

03:29.097 --> 03:32.976
Clean record. No next of kin.
Divorced ten years.

03:33.017 --> 03:38.216
- Ex runs a tea-importing business.
- He rented that room for two years.

03:38.257 --> 03:41.806
He was an ideal tenant.
Never missed a payment.

03:41.857 --> 03:44.371
Do you think he can do that now?

03:44.417 --> 03:47.215
Time of death, early evening.

03:47.257 --> 03:49.691
No sign of forced entry.

03:49.737 --> 03:53.969
- COD from blunt-force trauma.
- And the weapon is where?

03:54.017 --> 03:57.612
- Still missing.
- But we do have these.

03:57.657 --> 04:02.526
Top of the line. Nice panties.
Schiller a he-she?

04:02.577 --> 04:06.968
- He was a writer.
- And the tape over the vic's mouth?

04:07.017 --> 04:09.372
No prints. No roll of the tape found.

04:09.417 --> 04:13.729
Taping the mouth shut and the panties
suggest a personal agenda.

04:13.777 --> 04:16.894
- To embarrass him!
- Or to shut him up.

04:16.937 --> 04:20.452
- How well did he know Mrs Hayes?
- How well did she know him?

04:20.497 --> 04:24.092
She was non compos mentis.
We'll talk to her today.

04:25.137 --> 04:28.925
OK, Munch, Cassidy,
track down Schiller's ex-wife.

04:34.737 --> 04:37.251
Mrs Hayes? We'd like to talk to you.

04:39.057 --> 04:44.290
Durst Publishing. One moment.

04:44.337 --> 04:48.569
- I can't leave this phone.
- It won't take very long.

04:48.617 --> 04:51.529
- Are you OK?
- Why wouldn't I be?

04:51.577 --> 04:55.252
- A lot happened last night.
- Huh! I'll say! Sorry.

04:55.297 --> 04:57.572
I'm worried about Virginia.

04:58.897 --> 05:02.731
- What time did she get home?
- She didn't.

05:02.777 --> 05:05.450
- Your daughter's missing?
- No.

05:05.497 --> 05:09.251
Durst Publishing. One moment.

05:09.297 --> 05:13.051
Give us a recent photo,
and we'll circulate it around.

05:13.097 --> 05:15.850
Whatever you want.

05:16.857 --> 05:19.530
Durst Publishing. One moment.

05:19.577 --> 05:22.933
- She's very pretty.
- Like mother, like daughter.

05:22.977 --> 05:26.014
Durst Publishing. Yes.

05:26.057 --> 05:30.016
Can you take us through
what happened last night?

05:30.057 --> 05:33.413
- OK. I came home.
- From where?

05:33.457 --> 05:36.927
From work.
And I was going through the mail.

05:36.977 --> 05:41.573
I saw a bill for Richard,
and I thought I'd take it up to him.

05:41.617 --> 05:44.006
So I went up there.

05:44.057 --> 05:46.696
I knocked, but there was no answer.

05:46.737 --> 05:50.252
Durst Publishing? One moment.

05:50.297 --> 05:53.130
When there was no answer,

05:53.177 --> 05:57.090
l-l opened the door,
and then I found him lying there.

05:57.137 --> 06:01.449
- How long have you rented the room?
- It's coming up on 11 years now.

06:01.497 --> 06:04.728
My ex-husband and I
bought it for our future.

06:04.777 --> 06:08.372
The tenants help cover
the mortgage payments.

06:08.417 --> 06:12.933
- Was Schiller dating anyone?
- He didn't bring anyone home.

06:12.977 --> 06:15.491
What was your relationship with him?

06:15.537 --> 06:17.971
- Did we sleep together?
- Yes.

06:18.017 --> 06:20.975
No.

06:21.017 --> 06:23.929
He was my tenant.
It was a business relationship.

06:23.977 --> 06:26.491
He had a fantastic credit rating.

06:26.537 --> 06:30.291
Durst Publishing. One moment.

06:30.337 --> 06:34.091
His editor is two floors up. John Freeman.

06:34.137 --> 06:37.573
I always thought
it would be foreign officials

06:37.617 --> 06:40.848
telling me all they'd found was a shoe.

06:40.897 --> 06:44.333
A lion, the rebels, a volcano got the rest.

06:44.377 --> 06:47.892
- The guy had a death wish?
- Please.

06:47.937 --> 06:52.089
- Thank you.
- He loved uncharted territory.

06:52.137 --> 06:56.813
He said, 'There's a shortage
of blank spaces on the map.'

06:56.857 --> 06:59.496
We'd just extended his contract.

06:59.537 --> 07:03.576
- What about Schiller and women?
- Honestly, he disliked baggage.

07:03.617 --> 07:06.575
He met so many different women.

07:06.617 --> 07:10.576
- Did you know him to solicit sex?
- No way. Nothing improper.

07:10.617 --> 07:13.450
He poured every cent into his trips.

07:13.497 --> 07:16.614
Any relationships that got out of hand?

07:16.657 --> 07:21.253
I can't think of anyone.
We were very open with each other.

07:21.297 --> 07:27.406
Richard had... This may sound corny,
but he had a real sense of honour.

07:27.457 --> 07:33.214
His writing is heartfelt, as were
his relationships. They ended well.

07:33.257 --> 07:36.055
His divorce ended in a hug.

07:38.537 --> 07:43.850
I last saw him a few months back,
when he came in for a special blend

07:43.897 --> 07:47.173
he'd had the last time he was in Morocco.

07:47.217 --> 07:51.176
When we first married,
he decided to settle down.

07:51.217 --> 07:53.651
No more travelling.

07:53.697 --> 07:59.647
Then I'd catch him secretly running
his fingers over the world atlas,

07:59.697 --> 08:02.734
like it was a Braille Penthouse.

08:04.497 --> 08:08.172
I prefer the Story Of O,
but I take your point.

08:08.217 --> 08:14.611
By the end, the very mention of a different
area code would spark a fight.

08:14.657 --> 08:17.455
Now I deal with ten different countries.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.648
Not all marriages end so well.

08:20.697 --> 08:25.930
We were better friends than lovers.
I wasn't the great love of his life.

08:25.977 --> 08:28.775
That's hard to believe.

08:28.817 --> 08:32.287
To us he's a naked corpse
with lingerie down his throat.

08:32.337 --> 08:34.770
Unnerving, isn't it?

08:34.817 --> 08:37.933
A degrading death
overshadows a remarkable life.

08:37.977 --> 08:41.128
Like Rockefeller dying
on top of his mistress.

08:41.177 --> 08:43.975
- It's my preferred way to go.
- And now?

08:44.017 --> 08:47.214
- We tackle his address book.
- Let's do it.

08:47.257 --> 08:51.455
Yes, Richard Schiller.

08:51.497 --> 08:54.216
Da, da. Schiller.

09:00.937 --> 09:05.567
- Gracias. Muchas gracias.
- Anything from Belize?

09:05.617 --> 09:11.135
A tamale maker who got a nice
mention in a book. Otherwise, nada.

09:11.177 --> 09:14.772
- How about the police in Berlin?
- Big fat nein.

09:14.817 --> 09:19.174
OK. Let's look at who's not in this book.

09:19.217 --> 09:22.015
Travellers have brief relationships.

09:22.057 --> 09:25.493
- He could have picked up a stranger.
- 27 got a call.

09:25.537 --> 09:30.770
The owner of a newsstand caught
a shoplifter called Virginia Hayes.

09:30.817 --> 09:34.173
- Santa Claus, there is a Virginia.
- Tell them we'll take it.

09:34.217 --> 09:36.094
I already did.

09:36.137 --> 09:39.095
She's all yours.

09:40.097 --> 09:43.055
I lose business with these people!

09:43.097 --> 09:46.089
Virginia Hayes? Come with us.

09:46.137 --> 09:48.731
Kids imaginate their own rules!

09:48.777 --> 09:53.009
- C'mon. Let's go.
- Hey! Who pays for my magazine?

09:56.377 --> 09:58.572
Here. Keep the change.

10:00.817 --> 10:04.446
I'm Detective Stabler
and this is Detective Benson.

10:04.497 --> 10:07.330
So you're not truant officers.

10:07.377 --> 10:12.610
- I'm looking for the Katonah train.
- I think it's the New Haven line.

10:12.657 --> 10:16.013
- Try Information.
- North Brewster line.

10:16.057 --> 10:18.855
Track 117. You got about five minutes.

10:18.897 --> 10:21.695
- Thanks.
- Whatever.

10:22.697 --> 10:26.326
Virginia, something happened
at home last night.

10:26.377 --> 10:28.368
Mom?

10:43.417 --> 10:46.568
It's Schilly. Schilly died.

10:46.617 --> 10:49.609
- My poor baby!
- You bitch!

10:49.657 --> 10:53.411
- You couldn't leave him alone!
- Virginia, calm down.

10:53.457 --> 10:56.176
Calm down.

11:01.857 --> 11:05.213
My mother was only faithful to the bottle.

11:05.257 --> 11:10.092
She drove my father away.
He didn't even have time to say goodbye.

11:10.137 --> 11:14.415
- But you and he?
- We were meant to meet at weekends.

11:16.457 --> 11:18.925
It's been his weekend for 10 years.

11:18.977 --> 11:21.491
I'm still waiting to be picked up.

11:21.537 --> 11:24.654
- Where were you last night?
- I went swimming.

11:24.697 --> 11:30.090
On my way home I got on the wrong train,
so I rode around for a while.

11:30.137 --> 11:32.731
You just decided to ride around?

11:32.777 --> 11:37.214
- 'The adventure begins with you.'
- That a Schiller line?

11:38.497 --> 11:41.807
- Did Schiller bring women home?
- No.

11:41.857 --> 11:46.248
The only thing Schiller brought home
was a small suitcase.

11:46.297 --> 11:48.891
- Did he get a break on the rent?
- No.

11:48.937 --> 11:52.009
She provided all modern conveniences.

11:52.057 --> 11:56.494
- So, they had a relationship?
- Do you mean with a capital 'R'

11:56.537 --> 11:59.893
- or little 'r' relationship?
- One that involves sex.

11:59.937 --> 12:02.246
Capital 'R' relationship.

12:02.297 --> 12:06.336
No. Schilly drove her crazy
because he never refused her directly.

12:06.377 --> 12:10.086
His manners kept her hopes up.
She's not used to polite men.

12:10.137 --> 12:12.526
What was their relationship like?

12:12.577 --> 12:15.614
Mom was jealous of Schilly,

12:15.657 --> 12:19.047
jealous of his life, his freedom.

12:19.097 --> 12:21.406
He wasn't saddled with a kid.

12:23.417 --> 12:27.296
This underwear look familiar to you?

12:27.337 --> 12:33.287
Mommy's. She wore the good stuff
when she wanted to get lucky.

12:33.337 --> 12:36.727
Fat lot of good it did her this time.

12:43.457 --> 12:46.210
Guys. This is Virginia.

12:46.257 --> 12:48.817
- Hiya, Ginny.
- Virginia!

12:50.377 --> 12:54.165
- The detectives will take you home.
- Can I drive?

12:54.217 --> 12:57.493
- Same age as my partner. Why not?
- What?

12:57.537 --> 12:59.687
Cool!

12:59.737 --> 13:01.807
She's tough.

13:01.857 --> 13:05.611
She's like Maureen. Drama's a major
food group for teenage girls.

13:07.137 --> 13:12.165
- Seven tenants in five years.
- Only one still left in Manhattan.

13:15.657 --> 13:21.766
Constantly touching me. Even when
I asked to be alone, she bothered me.

13:21.817 --> 13:26.766
Dropping off mail, leaving cookies
and milk. I'm lactose intolerant.

13:26.817 --> 13:29.729
Were you ever involved with her?

13:29.777 --> 13:32.211
No! No, no, no!

13:32.257 --> 13:35.090
How did she react when you said no?

13:35.137 --> 13:39.688
I had a friend come home,
pretend she was my girlfriend.

13:39.737 --> 13:42.410
Mrs Hayes tore into us.

13:42.457 --> 13:46.496
She threw my friend out and
then she literally read me the lease.

13:46.537 --> 13:49.893
- 'No overnight guests.'
- Why did you stay?

13:49.937 --> 13:52.246
I was in grad school. I was broke.

13:52.297 --> 13:56.131
It's like when I travel.
I'd rather stay in a hotel

13:56.177 --> 13:58.975
than one of those charming B&Bs.

13:59.017 --> 14:03.772
I prefer anonymity. Solitude.
I hate making small talk

14:03.817 --> 14:06.729
over tiny blueberry muffins.

14:11.777 --> 14:14.530
Do you know how Mr Schiller died,
Mrs Hayes?

14:14.577 --> 14:18.809
His mouth was taped shut,
and he looked ready to hit a home run.

14:18.857 --> 14:22.406
When you came home,
no one else was here?

14:22.457 --> 14:24.971
No. I told you no before.

14:25.017 --> 14:27.531
What are you getting at?

14:27.577 --> 14:31.775
When you found the body,
did you touch it in any way?

14:31.817 --> 14:36.845
Oh, yeah! I collected next month's rent.
Of course I didn't.

14:36.897 --> 14:42.255
Then explain how a pair of lacy
underwear was found in his mouth.

14:42.297 --> 14:47.655
I have no idea. Maybe it was some
weird sex thing. I don't know.

14:47.697 --> 14:51.531
- Did he ever take your underwear?
- Who said they were mine?

14:53.937 --> 14:59.375
Not that I know of. But how well
do you ever really know someone?

14:59.417 --> 15:04.332
The underpants didn't just
magically appear in his throat.

15:04.377 --> 15:07.016
Maybe they crawled down.

15:07.057 --> 15:10.094
You were angry
because Schiller wasn't interested.

15:10.137 --> 15:13.925
- I wasn't.
- Angry he'd kept his hands off you.

15:13.977 --> 15:16.332
- You wanted more.
- No.

15:16.377 --> 15:19.130
There was a time, yes. But...

15:19.177 --> 15:23.648
Now I have a boyfriend.
At least, I think I do.

15:24.697 --> 15:27.370
- A boyfriend?
- Tom.

15:27.417 --> 15:32.889
He works in a department store.
Gets me a great deal on underwear.

15:32.937 --> 15:37.488
- When was the last time you saw Tom?
- Last night.

15:40.257 --> 15:43.090
We er... we met for drinks.

15:44.137 --> 15:48.847
Had a fight. About Schiller, of all things.

15:48.897 --> 15:52.970
He thought that there was
something going on between us.

15:53.017 --> 15:57.932
- Why didn't you say this before?
- Tom once told me he loved me.

15:57.977 --> 16:00.366
That's worth a lot.

16:02.417 --> 16:05.807
- You think he did this?
- I hope not.

16:07.737 --> 16:11.616
- You two met for drinks, er, where?
- Julian's Bistro.

16:11.657 --> 16:15.206
65 St Mark's. About six.

16:15.257 --> 16:18.135
Can you give us Tom's full name?

16:20.177 --> 16:22.737
Thomas Dayton.

16:22.777 --> 16:27.692
Tom Dayton's a happy hour regular.
Nice guy, only he brought a date.

16:27.737 --> 16:31.571
- Why's that memorable?
- They had a blow-up about my tip.

16:31.617 --> 16:34.689
She wanted to leave more.
He wanted to leave less.

16:34.737 --> 16:38.650
All of a sudden, she loved him more.
He loved her less. Anything else?

16:38.697 --> 16:41.973
- I stayed out of it.
- Did they leave together?

16:42.017 --> 16:45.930
No. She nursed some Manhattans.
She was better off without him.

16:45.977 --> 16:50.050
Women are always better off
left to their own mechanical devices.

16:50.097 --> 16:52.531
Sure you know what I mean.

16:53.617 --> 16:57.656
Uh-huh. Yeah. That's him over there.
You're welcome.

16:57.697 --> 17:01.451
- Tom Dayton?
- Do I know you?

17:01.497 --> 17:04.887
Detectives Benson and Stabler,
Special Victims Unit.

17:04.936 --> 17:08.816
- It's about Richard Schiller.
- How long have you dated Mrs Hayes?

17:08.857 --> 17:14.089
- Seven months. She's really serious.
- And you?

17:14.137 --> 17:18.289
Loving someone who expected more
of life is a big responsibility.

17:18.337 --> 17:21.646
I'm not sure I'm ready
to be a father to a teenager.

17:21.696 --> 17:24.336
- You never are.
- You have kids?

17:24.377 --> 17:26.685
- Yeah.
- Lucky man. Teenagers.

17:26.737 --> 17:31.208
I know their fashion sense.
I have to, it's my job.

17:31.257 --> 17:33.407
But Virginia's hard to read.

17:33.457 --> 17:37.052
Mrs Hayes said you and she
had a fight the night Schiller died.

17:37.097 --> 17:39.930
It was about Schiller, like all our fights.

17:39.977 --> 17:42.252
Do you think they had an affair?

17:42.297 --> 17:45.528
Nah. He was packing for his next big trip.

17:45.577 --> 17:49.047
She kept talking about him. I overreacted.

17:49.097 --> 17:51.531
I don't have proof of anything.

17:51.577 --> 17:55.126
- Where'd you go after that?
- I came home. Alone.

17:55.177 --> 17:57.850
- Anybody see you?
- The doorman.

17:57.897 --> 18:02.766
I was tired. I'm doing a lot of overtime.
Homecoming, you know.

18:02.817 --> 18:05.206
Yeah, I know.

18:05.257 --> 18:10.650
They have a fight. Dayton goes to
the Hayes house and kills Schiller.

18:10.697 --> 18:15.532
It'd make more sense,
if Dayton's strong enough to take him on.

18:15.577 --> 18:19.411
Why didn't Mrs Hayes
tell us about Tom Dayton before?

18:19.457 --> 18:23.370
Haven't you ever tried
to protect someone you love?

18:32.257 --> 18:34.771
Hey! That's mine.

18:34.817 --> 18:38.253
- Dad? It's for you.
- Stabler.

18:39.897 --> 18:43.333
Yeah. OK, I'll meet you there. Bye-bye.

18:44.377 --> 18:47.608
- You go. I'll see you for dessert.
- Yeah.

18:47.657 --> 18:50.774
- Sure you will.
- OK. You know the drill.

18:50.817 --> 18:52.853
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

18:52.897 --> 18:57.049
Have you washed your hands?
Good one. Love you. Love you!

18:58.537 --> 19:01.847
- Love you.
- No, Dad. Not on the lips.

19:05.377 --> 19:09.256
- When did that happen?
- When you were at work.

19:14.417 --> 19:16.885
He's dead.

19:17.897 --> 19:20.730
Thomas Dayton. Died in '87.

19:20.777 --> 19:23.769
I wonder if Thomas had a sibling.

19:25.257 --> 19:27.566
Right there, older brother Scott.

19:27.617 --> 19:33.214
Scott seems to have borrowed
his brother's social security number.

19:36.657 --> 19:39.410
Scott Dayton.

19:39.457 --> 19:42.415
Convicted two counts child molestation.

19:42.457 --> 19:45.449
October 1990, Seattle.

19:45.497 --> 19:47.533
He liked to work with his hands.

19:47.577 --> 19:51.172
It wasn't Mrs Hayes
he wanted to keep to himself.

19:51.217 --> 19:53.412
It was Virginia.

19:56.497 --> 20:01.048
All right now. See? We just pull this up,
take that in. See how it looks?

20:01.097 --> 20:03.452
- Yeah.
- That's a great colour.

20:03.497 --> 20:06.295
You know
where we might find Scott Dayton?

20:07.497 --> 20:09.886
- You all right?
- Yeah! Get him.

20:23.977 --> 20:28.289
- I was just trying to do my job.
- Exactly what we were afraid of.

20:36.297 --> 20:39.448
- 'I hear you have quite an eye.'
- 'I enjoy my job.'

20:39.497 --> 20:43.490
'I bet! Back to school's probably
your favourite time of year, huh?

20:43.537 --> 20:46.176
'All those poodle skirts.'

20:46.217 --> 20:48.287
I work hard to meet tight budgets,

20:48.337 --> 20:50.897
to make an awkward teenager look her best.

20:50.937 --> 20:53.656
I bet you suggest a lot of alterations.

20:53.697 --> 20:55.449
- They're often needed.
- Please!

20:55.497 --> 20:58.853
I was trained as a dressmaker.
It's what I'm good at.

20:58.897 --> 21:01.457
You give it that personal touch, huh?

21:01.497 --> 21:04.057
Yes. It involves touching.

21:04.097 --> 21:08.249
Any touching at all, regardless of
my history, is taboo in this country.

21:08.297 --> 21:10.686
I guess Mrs Hayes is
one of those crazy women

21:10.737 --> 21:14.412
who doesn't run background checks
on boyfriends. Does she know?

21:14.457 --> 21:18.814
- Know what? I didn't kill...
- That you're a convicted paedophile.

21:20.497 --> 21:21.612
No.

21:23.497 --> 21:25.772
On my release, I wanted a clean start,

21:25.817 --> 21:29.696
which, as a convicted sex offender,
you can never have.

21:29.737 --> 21:33.696
And when I met Annabel,
I honestly thought we had a chance.

21:33.737 --> 21:37.047
We have a normal sex life.
Three times a week.

21:37.097 --> 21:41.249
Every time you thought of Annabel's
daughter. What d'you do to her?

21:41.297 --> 21:42.889
I never touched Ginny.

21:42.937 --> 21:44.893
- Virginia!
- I control my impulses.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.893
- I had therapy.
- You touched her.

21:46.937 --> 21:50.486
Even if I'd wanted to,
which I didn't, I never had the chance.

21:50.537 --> 21:52.607
What do you mean?

21:52.657 --> 21:54.887
I mean the two of them.

21:54.937 --> 21:57.815
They'd sit at the dinner table,
flanking Schiller,

21:57.857 --> 22:00.849
tossing their hair and gabbing at him.

22:00.897 --> 22:04.287
An attention-getting contest.
Virginia and her mother.

22:04.337 --> 22:06.692
And Virginia won.

22:06.737 --> 22:09.888
What you're saying is
Schiller was the paedophile.

22:09.937 --> 22:11.529
Yes. Definitely.

22:12.897 --> 22:15.092
Schiller?

22:15.137 --> 22:17.697
I saw the way he'd look at her.

22:17.737 --> 22:20.205
And I know that look.

22:21.297 --> 22:25.085
- And that made you jealous.
- And you did something about it.

22:25.137 --> 22:28.288
He kept chatting her up
so you decided to shut his mouth.

22:28.337 --> 22:31.056
I didn't touch Virginia or kill Schiller.

22:31.097 --> 22:33.486
- You lied to Annabel!
- I'm different now!

22:33.537 --> 22:36.495
Who gets jealous
of the affections of a little girl.

22:36.537 --> 22:40.246
Why not ask Annabel to marry you?
Make Virginia Daddy's little girl!

22:40.297 --> 22:42.367
Elliot!

22:43.097 --> 22:46.726
- Sometimes enough is enough.
- No, it's not. It never is.

22:46.777 --> 22:49.416
Dayton pulled his life around, got a job.

22:49.457 --> 22:52.847
- In the juniors' department.
- It's hard to change career.

22:52.897 --> 22:55.855
We have no hard evidence
Dayton did anything.

22:55.897 --> 22:59.094
He steals his dead brother's
social security card,

22:59.137 --> 23:01.048
he evades his parole officer.

23:01.097 --> 23:03.850
This guy will lie to his last breath!

23:03.897 --> 23:07.048
Why shift blame to Schiller?
It's for what he's feeling!

23:07.097 --> 23:09.292
Y'know, I'm getting a headache.

23:09.337 --> 23:12.886
We have a convicted paedophile
saying he didn't molest anybody,

23:12.937 --> 23:15.497
and a dead guy, not a paedophile,
who might have.

23:15.537 --> 23:17.289
Maybe Dayton told the truth.

23:17.337 --> 23:20.170
Why? Cos paedophiles
are always so honest?

23:22.497 --> 23:25.375
Ask the girl. Where is she now?

23:36.697 --> 23:38.494
Over there.

23:44.617 --> 23:45.970
Hi.

23:49.297 --> 23:51.891
Whenever Mr Dayton stayed with my mom,

23:51.937 --> 23:56.692
he'd come into my room late at night,
when she'd fallen asleep,

23:56.737 --> 23:59.695
or when she passed out,
whichever came first.

24:00.297 --> 24:04.893
He would come to me... when
he didn't get what he wanted from her.

24:05.897 --> 24:08.092
I'd pretend I was asleep.

24:09.697 --> 24:11.892
But he always woke me up.

24:15.097 --> 24:18.089
Virginia. I know this is hard,

24:18.137 --> 24:20.093
but we need to know.

24:20.897 --> 24:22.728
Did he force you to touch him?

24:26.297 --> 24:27.810
That's not all, is it?

24:31.017 --> 24:33.008
Oral sex?

24:38.497 --> 24:40.294
Intercourse?

24:45.097 --> 24:49.090
I finally asked him to stop.
That's when Richard heard us.

24:50.897 --> 24:53.616
And a few nights before he died,

24:53.657 --> 24:57.889
Richard came into the room
and shoved him off of me and...

24:58.697 --> 25:02.895
Richard said that if he caught him
in my room again, he'd kill him.

25:03.897 --> 25:06.491
You came home that night, didn't you?

25:08.697 --> 25:10.289
Yeah.

25:11.097 --> 25:13.895
I found Richard
and I knew what had happened.

25:13.937 --> 25:16.451
He died trying to protect me. I freaked out.

25:17.297 --> 25:20.892
I ran to the train station
and I stayed there all night,

25:20.937 --> 25:25.089
watching the board
that posts arrivals and departures.

25:25.137 --> 25:27.890
I just wanted to leave so, so bad.

25:28.697 --> 25:30.688
Why didn't you?

25:33.097 --> 25:36.214
I didn't have anybody to go to.

25:36.257 --> 25:39.693
Your mom says
sometimes you borrow her clothes.

25:40.337 --> 25:42.214
Mm. The underwear.

25:43.097 --> 25:46.885
- Were you wearing them that day?
- Hm.

25:46.937 --> 25:49.246
Mom hates it when I do.

25:49.297 --> 25:51.891
But I dunno. It's so nice.

25:52.977 --> 25:56.652
- Why didn't you tell us?
- I didn't want to get in trouble.

25:57.497 --> 25:58.976
I...

25:59.017 --> 26:02.089
I hid them in the hamper after my shower.

26:02.137 --> 26:05.686
- When did you find Schiller's body?
- After my shower.

26:05.737 --> 26:09.286
- Approximately what time?
- I don't know.

26:10.897 --> 26:12.296
Six.

26:14.577 --> 26:16.568
What position was the body in?

26:23.697 --> 26:26.086
I always said hello after swimming.

26:27.097 --> 26:28.655
I swim and I swim,

26:28.697 --> 26:30.494
and I take 40-hour showers

26:30.537 --> 26:32.687
and I never feel clean!

26:41.257 --> 26:44.055
People like Dayton are habitual.
Ticking clocks.

26:44.097 --> 26:47.851
- It was only a matter of time.
- I'm sorry it had to be Virginia.

26:47.897 --> 26:50.252
We have enough to hold him.

26:52.297 --> 26:54.652
After I make a new copy of this.

26:54.697 --> 26:58.133
Uniformed officers checked the house.
Found no weapon.

26:58.177 --> 27:00.486
He had plenty of time to get rid of it.

27:00.537 --> 27:04.086
Why didn't Virginia tell us
upfront about the underwear?

27:04.137 --> 27:08.767
- She said she didn't want trouble.
- She didn't remember the body.

27:08.817 --> 27:11.650
She sees he's dead,
adrenaline rush kicks in.

27:11.697 --> 27:17.215
You never forget! I ask about the body,
she starts up the tear factory.

27:17.257 --> 27:19.771
- What did you expect?
- A straight answer?

27:19.817 --> 27:20.966
What's going on?

27:21.017 --> 27:23.531
Anyone who's seen a Tori Spelling movie

27:23.577 --> 27:26.091
could have given the same performance.

27:26.137 --> 27:29.288
I would think you of all people
would be on her side.

27:29.337 --> 27:33.012
Every scenario
has different interpretations, OK?

27:33.057 --> 27:37.130
Let's try this one on.
Virginia fled the scene of the crime.

27:37.177 --> 27:40.852
- She was scared.
- And OJ Simpson likes an afternoon drive.

27:40.897 --> 27:43.013
Same facts, different interpretation.

27:43.057 --> 27:45.890
If you need more time with the menu,
I can come back.

27:45.937 --> 27:49.532
Schiller had sex just before he was killed.

27:49.577 --> 27:51.852
ME's found secretions on him.

27:51.897 --> 27:55.253
- And what about on the underwear?
- A match.

27:55.297 --> 27:57.288
Tom Dayton never touched her.

27:58.017 --> 28:01.805
- Virginia and Schiller.
- 'Fraid so.

28:03.097 --> 28:06.089
- He raped her.
- There's another possibility.

28:06.697 --> 28:11.293
- Virginia was aroused.
- OK. A couple of scenarios.

28:11.337 --> 28:14.329
One. Mother walked in,
flew into a rage, killed him.

28:14.377 --> 28:17.733
Two. Mother's boyfriend walks in,
rage, kills him.

28:17.777 --> 28:21.736
- Three. Virginia flew into a rage, killed him.
- No.

28:21.777 --> 28:24.735
Everybody has their breaking point.

28:32.697 --> 28:36.292
No way do you talk to her again.
Filling her head with garbage...

28:36.337 --> 28:39.852
Fine. 8:00am tomorrow
we want to see you, your daughter,

28:39.897 --> 28:42.286
and your lawyer down at the station.

28:45.297 --> 28:49.893
Tell me, Virginia, does killing a man
make you feel all grown-up?

28:54.497 --> 28:58.695
- Maureen has a boyfriend.
- Probably kisses him on the lips.

28:59.897 --> 29:03.492
- Do we know who he is?
- Jim. Jim Delmonico.

29:04.897 --> 29:07.889
- Little Jimmy?
- Little Jimmy is six foot

29:07.937 --> 29:10.292
with a voice to match.

29:10.337 --> 29:14.046
He's a junior. Fullback, first string.

29:14.097 --> 29:16.930
And he's asked our daughter
to homecoming.

29:16.977 --> 29:18.888
Little Jimmy's a junior!

29:18.937 --> 29:23.215
Hm. You'll probably run into him.
They do a lot of studying together.

29:23.257 --> 29:25.293
Oh, no, no, no.

29:25.337 --> 29:27.532
El! Relax.

29:33.497 --> 29:35.886
Has Maureen had sex yet, do you know?

29:35.937 --> 29:37.893
God, I hope not.

29:40.097 --> 29:42.895
I wonder how we will know.

29:42.937 --> 29:44.689
If we'll know.

29:46.297 --> 29:48.686
No. Hey, Munch, she's a child.

29:48.737 --> 29:51.046
The appeal goes beyond a midlife crisis.

29:51.097 --> 29:53.486
The way her top shows her flat stomach.

29:53.537 --> 29:56.290
The mature discussions
about the Backstreet Boys.

29:56.337 --> 29:59.056
Everyone knows
women mature faster than men.

29:59.097 --> 30:04.125
True, a good Mrs Robinson is hard to find,
but women maturing faster? Conspiracy.

30:04.177 --> 30:07.931
The government's been covering up
the side effects of RBGH,

30:07.977 --> 30:10.889
a hormone that farmers use
to produce more milk.

30:10.937 --> 30:14.532
Like, erm, McGuire taking creatine
to bulk up, right?

30:14.577 --> 30:17.296
Farmers don't take it, Cassidy.
The cows do.

30:17.337 --> 30:21.091
Is there anything you just accept?

30:21.697 --> 30:24.336
- Yeah.
- Stabler.

30:24.377 --> 30:28.211
- Compliments.
- No wonder you're so sceptical.

30:28.257 --> 30:32.455
We'll be down. Virginia's in the hospital.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.692
She tried to commit suicide.

30:38.497 --> 30:41.694
- When was she admitted?
- About 7:00 this morning.

30:41.737 --> 30:44.251
Luckily, she only cut one wrist.

30:44.297 --> 30:47.130
- She gonna be OK?
- Yeah, she'll be fine.

30:47.177 --> 30:49.645
Fortunately, she didn't lose much blood.

30:49.697 --> 30:52.211
Doesn't sound like a serious attempt.

30:52.257 --> 30:54.213
Serious enough.

30:54.257 --> 30:58.330
In my experience, teenagers
wanting more than attention usually die.

31:00.497 --> 31:03.887
It's your fault. I've lost
the most important thing in my life.

31:03.937 --> 31:06.497
Mrs Hayes, Virginia will be fine.

31:06.537 --> 31:08.767
I meant Thomas!

31:08.817 --> 31:11.490
- You poisoned him against me.
- Easy!

31:11.537 --> 31:14.097
You self-important bitch!

31:19.057 --> 31:21.446
Mother's threatening to sue.

31:21.497 --> 31:25.934
- Lost wages, hospital bills.
- Add a few zeros for a broken heart.

31:25.977 --> 31:27.490
Mother's an alcoholic.

31:27.537 --> 31:31.689
Which won't justify you tearing into a girl.
Where were the kid gloves?

31:31.737 --> 31:34.934
- If she was a kid, I would have used them.
- She is a kid!

31:34.977 --> 31:39.095
Chronologically. But Virginia Hayes
is no child. Probably not a victim.

31:39.137 --> 31:42.254
- And Mrs Hayes?
- Drunks are victims in their minds.

31:42.297 --> 31:45.448
There was a relationship
between Virginia and Schiller?

31:45.497 --> 31:46.646
- Right?
- No.

31:46.697 --> 31:47.891
- Yes.
- Come on!

31:47.937 --> 31:50.053
- We don't know.
- They had sex!

31:50.097 --> 31:52.930
She tried to kill herself. She's overwhelmed.

31:52.977 --> 31:54.569
Or she was cornered!

31:54.617 --> 31:57.211
- You think she killed him?
- I do!

31:57.257 --> 32:01.694
- I'm not ready to take that leap.
- Do I hear self-defence?

32:04.737 --> 32:07.695
Look, we're gonna
have to work this out, OK?

32:07.737 --> 32:11.491
So, erm, once we get that
taken care of, we will call you.

32:11.537 --> 32:13.493
I can't wait.

32:16.497 --> 32:18.010
Neither can I.

32:18.897 --> 32:21.695
The mom had a revolving door
of boyfriends.

32:21.737 --> 32:25.889
Virginia learnt at an early age
that men were just a commodity.

32:25.937 --> 32:28.007
That, and as arcane as it sounds,

32:28.057 --> 32:32.289
there is truth in the notion
every girl wants to marry her father.

32:32.337 --> 32:34.293
Most of them outgrow it.

32:34.857 --> 32:36.654
When a father's absent,

32:36.697 --> 32:41.088
it's not unusual for a younger girl
to be attracted to an older man.

32:41.897 --> 32:43.888
That's what this is about?

32:44.697 --> 32:46.847
It happens more than you think.

32:46.897 --> 32:48.888
How old were you?

32:50.497 --> 32:52.727
- Almost 17.
- And he was?

32:53.737 --> 32:56.888
Older than 17.
About as old as I am now.

32:56.937 --> 32:59.895
And I tell you,
I couldn't have loved him more.

32:59.937 --> 33:03.134
However you view it,
it's an unequal relationship.

33:03.177 --> 33:07.090
Being in love?
That does not absolve an affair.

33:07.137 --> 33:09.697
I'm not saying that love is an excuse.

33:09.737 --> 33:13.696
I'm saying that soul mates
come in all shapes and sizes and ages.

33:13.737 --> 33:16.649
- Soul mates? Come on, Olivia.
- Elliot!

33:16.697 --> 33:20.690
She didn't remember the position
of the body, Have you ever seen that?

33:22.777 --> 33:27.168
- What are you trying to protect?
- Her. I'm trying to protect her.

33:27.217 --> 33:29.447
No. It's your daughter. You can't.

33:29.497 --> 33:31.692
Don't bring her into this.

33:32.617 --> 33:35.336
Maureen! You look terrific.

33:35.377 --> 33:37.095
You look great.

33:37.137 --> 33:39.093
Just one more. One more.

33:41.497 --> 33:44.011
- Hey!
- What's up?

33:44.057 --> 33:47.208
- Nothing.
- For you.

33:49.697 --> 33:52.165
Thank you. Mom?

33:55.057 --> 33:58.493
OK. Let's have a picture
by the fireplace, you two.

33:59.097 --> 34:01.895
Sweetheart, can you get out of the picture?

34:03.697 --> 34:05.892
OK. One more.

34:06.937 --> 34:10.293
- Mom, we do have to go. So, stop!
- Oh, yeah. OK.

34:10.337 --> 34:12.293
Say good night to him.

34:13.097 --> 34:15.292
You look great.

34:15.337 --> 34:17.487
Right. Have fun.

34:17.536 --> 34:20.495
- Night, Jimmy.
- You look beautiful, honey.

34:29.697 --> 34:31.688
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.

34:32.337 --> 34:34.692
- Don't wait up for me.
- Yeah, right.

34:49.456 --> 34:52.290
- Virginia?
- I'm upstairs.

35:02.817 --> 35:04.614
You wanted to talk to us?

35:07.817 --> 35:10.889
Thomas Dayton never touched you,
did he?

35:10.937 --> 35:14.327
Tom. No. He didn't.

35:14.377 --> 35:16.572
It was Schiller? He raped you?

35:20.497 --> 35:25.287
Tell us. It changes everything
if Schiller sexually assaulted you.

35:29.177 --> 35:31.486
I wouldn't call it assault.

35:32.497 --> 35:35.967
We need to hear it in your words, Virginia.

35:36.017 --> 35:38.451
How did it start?

35:38.497 --> 35:42.331
Schiller would tell Mom and me
stories about his travels.

35:42.377 --> 35:45.449
We'd sit up late at night in the kitchen,

35:45.497 --> 35:50.810
listening about places
that had names like Kuala Lumpur

35:50.857 --> 35:53.052
and Burkina Faso.

35:53.097 --> 35:54.928
When did it get sexual, Virginia?

35:54.977 --> 35:56.933
July 17th.

35:57.697 --> 36:01.007
It was raining. Mom wasn't home.

36:01.057 --> 36:05.494
Schiller and I ordered Ethiopian food.
It was delicious.

36:05.537 --> 36:08.847
- And then what happened?
- I kissed him.

36:08.897 --> 36:11.969
- That's how it started.
- He coerced you?

36:12.017 --> 36:14.895
No. We couldn't help ourselves.

36:14.937 --> 36:18.976
I had never felt that... pull before.

36:21.497 --> 36:23.613
It's every man's fantasy, right?

36:23.657 --> 36:26.694
Having some young girl want him?

36:29.497 --> 36:33.888
But it was so much more than that.
For the first time in my life,

36:33.937 --> 36:37.088
making love... felt natural.

36:37.697 --> 36:39.494
Felt good.

36:40.097 --> 36:41.928
For the first time, I felt safe.

36:43.857 --> 36:47.054
- How long did it continue?
- Months.

36:47.097 --> 36:51.090
When he was home,
he made this house bearable.

36:51.897 --> 36:55.492
When he would leave,
I didn't think I'd make it without him.

36:57.497 --> 36:59.692
I cried every night he was gone.

36:59.737 --> 37:05.892
When he came back, he promised
he'd never leave me behind again.

37:06.697 --> 37:09.336
When he was out, I would read his mail.

37:09.377 --> 37:13.290
And saw that he was gonna leave again.
For Romania this time.

37:13.337 --> 37:15.692
- And?
- I packed my bag.

37:15.737 --> 37:18.297
I wanted him to take me with him.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.487
He was sitting right there.

37:24.337 --> 37:25.895
Tell me.

37:31.697 --> 37:34.052
Tell me what happened.

37:34.097 --> 37:35.894
I did

37:37.297 --> 37:39.094
what he liked.

37:40.097 --> 37:42.088
What's that?

37:43.697 --> 37:46.894
I got on his lap. The chair leans back.

37:49.097 --> 37:51.088
And when we were finished,

37:51.737 --> 37:55.491
I leaned close
and asked him to take me away.

37:55.537 --> 37:57.289
'You promised.'

37:59.097 --> 38:01.292
What did he say?

38:01.337 --> 38:03.532
He said he needed to travel light.

38:04.297 --> 38:07.926
And I knew I couldn't stay
another day here without him.

38:10.537 --> 38:13.654
Something broke inside me.

38:15.897 --> 38:20.175
I didn't think. I put my knee on his throat
and I held it there.

38:22.017 --> 38:26.966
He made this wet, hissing sound.
He couldn't talk.

38:32.297 --> 38:34.288
And when he was still,

38:35.137 --> 38:39.289
I picked up my underwear
from the floor and I put it in his mouth.

38:42.257 --> 38:44.691
And I left.

38:48.097 --> 38:50.008
He had this drive,

38:50.057 --> 38:53.094
this... impulse to travel.

38:54.497 --> 38:56.294
Like you.

38:58.297 --> 39:01.095
He'd always promised to take me away,

39:01.137 --> 39:03.697
to a place where he would love me.

39:04.697 --> 39:08.246
And I just wanted so badly to leave this life.

39:08.297 --> 39:10.492
Oh! I miss him!

39:21.857 --> 39:24.690
Yeah?

39:26.497 --> 39:28.886
- Tough day.
- Hm.

39:33.097 --> 39:36.453
They're arraigning Virginia in the morning.

39:36.497 --> 39:38.567
ADA's going for man two.

39:39.897 --> 39:41.888
You OK with that?

39:45.897 --> 39:47.535
Talk to me.

39:48.577 --> 39:51.887
I have a child a little younger than Virginia.

39:53.497 --> 39:56.887
When she was born,
I used to take her to the playground

39:56.937 --> 39:59.690
and the grocery store, whatever.

40:02.097 --> 40:05.487
But it wasn't her
that I would watch, obsessively.

40:06.697 --> 40:11.293
It was the men. All around.
To protect her from what they might do.

40:12.297 --> 40:14.686
- Elliot...
- The other night, erm,

40:15.697 --> 40:18.575
her date comes to pick her up.

40:18.617 --> 40:22.371
And all I'm thinking is,
what is this guy gonna do to her?

40:22.417 --> 40:24.294
I know.

40:24.337 --> 40:26.692
I made a mistake today.

40:29.097 --> 40:30.894
I didn't see it.

40:31.697 --> 40:34.006
Olivia saw it.

40:34.057 --> 40:36.287
You got too wrapped up.

40:37.697 --> 40:40.495
I saw that girl like I saw my daughter.

40:41.697 --> 40:43.688
As a victim.

40:43.737 --> 40:47.696
Not as someone capable of... acting,

40:49.297 --> 40:51.094
or feeling,

40:52.097 --> 40:54.213
loving on their own.

40:56.097 --> 41:00.488
Your daughter caring for someone
doesn't mean she loves you any less.

41:00.537 --> 41:04.974
- I know that.
- You wanna be the only man in her life.

41:06.497 --> 41:08.408
No.

41:12.817 --> 41:14.216
Sort of.

41:16.097 --> 41:20.010
Elliot, your feelings will always be
a part of your police work.

41:20.057 --> 41:22.890
- Yeah. But...
- The more you try to deny that,

41:22.937 --> 41:25.576
the more control they will have over you.

41:25.617 --> 41:30.850
We work with different permutations
of sex all day, sometimes all night.

41:30.897 --> 41:33.491
Don't worry when you feel something.

41:34.297 --> 41:36.811
Worry when you don't.
