WEBVTT

00:06.310 --> 00:08.008
And just like everything else,

00:08.051 --> 00:09.879
when it comes to nature
and safety

00:09.922 --> 00:12.012
or even plain old life lessons,

00:12.055 --> 00:13.926
it's all in this book.

00:13.970 --> 00:17.060
Which brings us
archery!

00:17.104 --> 00:18.801
- Yay!
- Now, I'm sure

00:18.844 --> 00:20.846
we all just want to just start
flinging arrows at the targets,

00:20.890 --> 00:24.067
but, first, we need to go over
some basic safety rules, okay?

00:24.111 --> 00:27.027
Rule number one-- and
I cannot emphasize this enough--

00:27.070 --> 00:30.204
never notch an arrow
when someone is downra...

00:34.034 --> 00:35.296
Is it...

00:35.339 --> 00:36.384
uh...

00:36.427 --> 00:37.907
is it in my neck?

00:37.950 --> 00:40.518
Uh... this is actually
a great opportunity

00:40.562 --> 00:42.477
to discuss what to do
in this situation, right?

00:42.520 --> 00:43.826
Becky.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.567
Becky, you want to run

00:45.610 --> 00:46.916
and tell the lady
at the house

00:46.959 --> 00:49.005
and see if you
can use her phone?

00:49.049 --> 00:50.137
I'm gonna...

00:50.180 --> 00:51.834
I'm actually gonna take a nap,

00:51.877 --> 00:54.141
uh, behind the sh-shed
over there.

00:54.184 --> 00:56.534
Let's reconvene in 15, okay?

00:56.578 --> 00:58.188
Mm.

00:58.232 --> 01:01.278
You know, 15, 20.

01:16.206 --> 01:17.990
You guys really have
nothing better to do

01:18.034 --> 01:19.253
than just sit
and watch me work?

01:19.296 --> 01:20.428
- No. To the contrary.
- Not really.

01:21.777 --> 01:22.386
What's with him?

01:22.430 --> 01:23.257
You all right, Pete?

01:23.300 --> 01:24.997
My death day is coming up.

01:25.041 --> 01:27.261
Always makes me miss
my family.

01:27.304 --> 01:30.394
My beautiful wife Carol,
my sweet daughter Laura.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.179
You're lucky
you still have a family.

01:32.222 --> 01:34.181
Mine's long gone, I'm sure.

01:34.224 --> 01:35.791
What difference does it make?
I never see them.

01:35.834 --> 01:37.227
I don't even know
- what they're up to.
- Bro,

01:37.271 --> 01:39.838
you have access
to an actual Living now.

01:39.882 --> 01:42.058
Sam can track 'em down
- for you.
- That's true!

01:42.102 --> 01:43.364
- What's your wife's name?
- Carol Martino.

01:43.407 --> 01:44.756
Now, it's been a while,

01:44.800 --> 01:45.844
so you may need to hire a P.I.,

01:45.888 --> 01:47.368
track down
some leads.

01:47.411 --> 01:49.152
You're gonna want to go
to every JCPenney, IHOP,

01:49.196 --> 01:50.849
anywhere that sells beads...

01:50.893 --> 01:51.894
- Found her.
- Excuse me?

01:51.937 --> 01:53.374
That's her.

01:53.417 --> 01:54.375
How did you do that?

01:54.418 --> 01:55.376
I mean, it's Facebook.

01:55.419 --> 01:56.855
It's... social media.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.467
We talked about the
Internet, right?

01:59.510 --> 02:00.859
Ooh, the thing
with the cat movies?

02:00.903 --> 02:02.731
- Mm, mm.
- Yes, that was a very
fun two days

02:02.774 --> 02:05.386
for both of us, Alberta.
But Facebook is like a...

02:05.429 --> 02:07.431
It's a website
that's like a bulletin board

02:07.475 --> 02:10.260
where people talk about their
lives, they share photos...

02:10.304 --> 02:12.262
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Am I to understand that this

02:12.306 --> 02:14.743
is some sort of modern-day
publishing instrument

02:14.786 --> 02:17.137
from which anyone can
spread their message?

02:17.180 --> 02:18.225
Well, yeah.

02:18.268 --> 02:19.835
What a tool for
disseminating truth.

02:19.878 --> 02:21.793
What a boon to democracy.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.099
Good morning, babe.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.187
-- Aw.
- Good morning.
- Morning.

02:24.231 --> 02:25.449
Hey, last night
got pretty hot, huh?

02:25.493 --> 02:27.016
Oh, they're in here.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.235
Oh, of course they are.

02:28.278 --> 02:29.801
- Who's that?
- Uh, we're looking up

02:29.845 --> 02:31.760
Pete's wife.
And his daughter,

02:31.803 --> 02:33.370
who unfortunately is not
on here, Pete.

02:33.414 --> 02:36.112
But... looks like
your wife still lives nearby.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.810
Oh, my God. Carol,
if you are listening,

02:38.854 --> 02:40.247
please visit
Woodstone Mansion!

02:40.290 --> 02:41.422
Love, Pete!

02:41.465 --> 02:43.163
Uh, that's not how it works.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.208
Sam, you got to
invite her for him.

02:45.252 --> 02:46.775
I mean, what would I even say?

02:46.818 --> 02:49.212
Like, "Hi, your dead husband
lives on my property

02:49.256 --> 02:50.909
and wants
- to look at you"?
- Yeah!

02:50.953 --> 02:52.084
Yeah. That's
- pretty good.
- Yeah.

02:52.128 --> 02:53.129
- Wait, what's happening?
- Oh, they want me

02:53.173 --> 02:55.262
to invite Pete's wife
to the house.

02:55.305 --> 02:57.960
What? You can't do that.

02:58.003 --> 02:59.962
Meddling with the worlds
of the living and the dead.

03:00.005 --> 03:01.790
W-We're actually doing okay
without you. Thank you.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.139
Really? Is that bad?

03:03.183 --> 03:05.228
- Yes. It's very, <i>very</i> bad.
- Not there.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.143
Okay. Listen,

03:07.187 --> 03:08.840
it's like in, um--
in-in time travel movies

03:08.884 --> 03:10.799
where they tell you not
to interact with people

03:10.842 --> 03:12.279
or sleep with your mom.

03:12.322 --> 03:13.976
I mean, that's just kind of
good advice in general.

03:14.019 --> 03:15.543
Look, I get it from
the ghosts' perspective,

03:15.586 --> 03:16.935
'cause they ain't got
nothing going on.

03:16.979 --> 03:18.372
- No offense, guys.
- It's fine.

03:18.415 --> 03:19.895
But do <i>you</i> really want

03:19.938 --> 03:22.811
to rip open old
wounds for this woman?

03:22.854 --> 03:24.943
Nothing good can
- come from this.
- I mean,

03:24.987 --> 03:27.294
I wouldn't call seeing
my loved ones "nothing good."

03:27.337 --> 03:29.383
Yeah, okay, you're
- right. I won't do it.
- Aw.

03:29.426 --> 03:30.514
Thank you.

03:30.558 --> 03:31.907
Darn it.

03:31.950 --> 03:33.517
- Sorry, Pete.
- Yeah.

03:33.561 --> 03:37.129
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- Wow.

03:37.173 --> 03:38.914
Okay, let's look up
this bottle service chick

03:38.957 --> 03:40.176
who used to work at Marquee.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.180
<i>Welcome back to</i>

03:44.224 --> 03:46.051
It's Getting Hot In Here!

03:46.095 --> 03:47.966
I think I'm falling for you,
but...

03:48.010 --> 03:52.101
I just wish I knew what
you looked like under the parka.

03:52.144 --> 03:53.972
So confused. It...

03:54.016 --> 03:56.323
Okay, again, they
take 20 sexy singles

03:56.366 --> 03:58.020
and they put them in
a really cold house.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.326
So everybody has
to stay bundled up

03:59.369 --> 04:01.023
and you can't see
what anyone looks like.

04:01.066 --> 04:03.286
Okay. Why?

04:03.330 --> 04:05.506
So that the singles
can connect emotionally.

04:05.549 --> 04:07.334
And then, each week,
the thermostat gets set higher

04:07.377 --> 04:09.161
and higher until, by the end,

04:09.205 --> 04:11.903
everybody is naked
and, ideally, in love.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.862
- So dumb.
- Stupid.

04:13.905 --> 04:16.299
Listen, um, I know
you think I'm shallow--

04:16.343 --> 04:18.519
and sometimes maybe
I am-- but I cannot

04:18.562 --> 04:20.477
stop thinking about this
bottle service chick.

04:20.521 --> 04:21.609
- Come on, Trevor.
- No, no, no, no, no.

04:21.652 --> 04:24.220
We, we really had
something special.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.222
And if I hadn't died,

04:26.266 --> 04:27.876
she could have been the one.

04:27.919 --> 04:29.617
Nicky Fisher.
Please just look her up.

04:29.660 --> 04:32.010
Nicky with a "Y."Fine.

04:33.098 --> 04:35.144
Okay... Oh, my God,
that's her.

04:35.187 --> 04:36.406
I knew she'd
keep it tight.

04:36.450 --> 04:37.973
I knew she would.

04:38.016 --> 04:39.148
Is that her daughter?

04:39.191 --> 04:41.063
Oh, my God.
Nicky's a total MILF.

04:41.106 --> 04:42.934
Do you know what that means?
MILF? It's so funny.

04:42.978 --> 04:44.066
Shh! Trying to watch!

04:45.285 --> 04:47.635
To make fun of,
of course, 'cause it's...

04:47.678 --> 04:48.984
stupid.

04:51.116 --> 04:53.380
Am I crazy or does
she kind of have your eyes?

04:53.423 --> 04:55.251
When did you say
you two dated?

04:55.295 --> 04:57.209
Um... like,

04:57.253 --> 04:58.994
right before I died.
20, 21 years ago?

04:59.037 --> 05:01.301
"Graduated Penn
just like my dad.

05:01.344 --> 05:03.041
May he rest in peace."

05:03.085 --> 05:04.042
I went to Penn.

05:04.086 --> 05:05.261
I know.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.570
Oh, my God.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.920
I'm a DILF.

05:11.963 --> 05:13.400
Sam, there's something
I need to show you.

05:13.443 --> 05:14.575
It's important.

05:14.618 --> 05:16.228
Oh. Yeah, sure.

05:16.272 --> 05:17.534
You guys want me to put
something else on

05:17.578 --> 05:18.535
No.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.363
- No.
- Uh, we just want to see

05:20.407 --> 05:22.322
how stupid it gets. Yes.

05:22.365 --> 05:24.933
- Stupid.
- Stupid.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.587
There's a book on top
of the cabinet. Can you grab it?

05:28.458 --> 05:30.460
After my death,
the woman that owned the house

05:30.504 --> 05:32.941
found my manual, brought it
inside and placed it up there.

05:32.984 --> 05:34.290
It's been up there ever since.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.336
Pete, this is incredible.
Did-did you highlight

05:36.379 --> 05:38.599
all this stuff
and write all these notes?

05:38.642 --> 05:40.122
I was never without this book.

05:40.165 --> 05:41.689
Carol knows
how important this was to me.

05:41.732 --> 05:43.691
She'll come get it
if you tell her you found it.

05:43.734 --> 05:44.996
Pete, I
don't know.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.434
Please. Carol's almost 70.

05:47.477 --> 05:50.306
I-I don't know if I'm gonna get
a chance to see her again.

05:53.135 --> 05:56.181
Sienna, because you left McNair

05:56.225 --> 05:57.574
out in the cold,

05:57.618 --> 05:59.228
it's time to find out
what you missed.

06:03.014 --> 06:04.407
Oh...

06:12.589 --> 06:15.157
Not fair. Wanted them
to be together.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.115
So that's it? It's
just over for them?

06:17.159 --> 06:21.163
This is so unfair! I had no idea
his body was so good!

06:22.773 --> 06:24.775
But he loves you.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.083
He's so hot.

06:28.126 --> 06:29.171
You crying?

06:29.214 --> 06:31.042
No.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.305
Yeah, me neither.

06:34.132 --> 06:35.612
Don't look at Thor!

06:35.656 --> 06:37.353
Hi. Carol?

06:37.397 --> 06:39.573
You don't know who I am,
but I think I have something

06:39.616 --> 06:41.444
that belonged
to your late husband.

06:41.488 --> 06:42.837
Oh, my God!

06:42.880 --> 06:45.143
Babe, it's way harder
when you can actually see

06:45.187 --> 06:46.406
and hear them.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.016
Sorry, I'm still here.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.234
Hey, Carol.
It's me! It's Pete!

06:49.278 --> 06:50.453
Your Petey Pie!
The Re-Peter!

06:50.497 --> 06:52.020
Can you not... Okay.

06:52.063 --> 06:53.500
hear me, Carol?

06:53.543 --> 06:55.676
Because I-I can
hear you just fine.

06:55.719 --> 06:57.765
This is bad. This is very bad.

06:57.808 --> 06:58.809
Petey Pie!

07:04.511 --> 07:06.338
How do I look?
Is my arrow straight?

07:06.382 --> 07:07.296
Pete,
you must calm down.

07:07.339 --> 07:09.124
You're a nervous wreck.

07:09.167 --> 07:10.517
I know. I just can't believe
I'm about to see my wife

07:10.560 --> 07:12.040
- after all these years.
Hey, who knows?

07:12.083 --> 07:13.389
Maybe she'll drop dead
while she's here

07:13.433 --> 07:14.651
and become a ghost.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.218
Do you think
that's possible?

07:16.261 --> 07:18.438
She did suffer from
hypertension, even in her 40s.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.614
Why are you trying
- to get his hopes up?
- Sorry.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.224
No, you're right, you're right.
I'm just gonna try

07:22.267 --> 07:24.400
to enjoy the day,
even if my wife doesn't die.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.576
- The carriage approaches.
- What?

07:27.577 --> 07:29.057
Oh!

07:29.100 --> 07:31.102
Carol,
Carol, Carol!

07:31.146 --> 07:33.278
I'm telling you, we should
not be doing this, okay?

07:33.322 --> 07:35.585
We are messing with forces
way beyond our comprehension.

07:35.629 --> 07:37.413
This is like "wrath of
God" stuff right here.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.762
Okay, babe, you're being
a bit dramatic.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.416
You don't invite
the still-living wife

07:40.460 --> 07:42.418
of a dead ghost to the house.
You just don't do it.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.811
I mean, have you
seen a sci-fi movie?

07:43.854 --> 07:45.421
These things
don't end well.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.727
Don't those, like,
all end well?

07:46.770 --> 07:48.076
Not before a ton
of people are killed

07:48.119 --> 07:49.773
and almost sleep
with their mom. Hi!

07:49.817 --> 07:51.601
Boy, he's
- really hung up on that.
- Mm.

07:52.776 --> 07:54.082
Oh, my God, it's happening.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.126
My Care Bear.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.563
What?

07:56.606 --> 07:57.738
She brought Jerry.

07:57.781 --> 07:59.217
Hey, Jerry Bean!

07:59.261 --> 08:00.741
This is amazing.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.220
- Ha.
- Who's Jerry?

08:02.264 --> 08:03.831
Oh, my old
- best friend.
- What's he saying?

08:03.874 --> 08:05.572
Jerry's
his old best friend.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.487
- Oh, my God.
- Aw, that's
so great.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.445
They kept
in touch.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.533
Hello.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.274
Jerry!

08:12.317 --> 08:13.449
They can't see me.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.843
I'm Carol.
Obviously. Hello.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.453
- Hello.
- Hey. Jay.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.499
This is Jerry, my husband.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.763
Did she say "husband"?

08:22.806 --> 08:25.200
I am so glad
you guys could make it.

08:25.243 --> 08:27.202
If it means anything,
I would completely understand

08:27.245 --> 08:29.291
if Beatrice ended up
with my best mate Edward.

08:29.334 --> 08:31.293
I mean, who could blame her?

08:31.336 --> 08:34.383
Them. Them. For finding comfort
in each other's arms.

08:34.426 --> 08:37.125
Excuse me. I just need
to take this real quick.

08:37.168 --> 08:38.561
Hey, how are you feeling?

08:38.605 --> 08:39.693
Oh, sorry, I'll wait
till you're done.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.390
Nope, I'm talking to you.

08:41.433 --> 08:43.305
Oh. That's clever.

08:43.348 --> 08:44.785
If you're asking
about Carol and Jerry,

08:44.828 --> 08:47.527
I was a little thrown, but
I'm glad they ended up together.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.659
They were probably both
so upset about losing me.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.356
Makes a lot of sense.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.315
Jay, he's happy.

08:54.490 --> 08:55.491
A friend of ours
just bought a car.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.448
I was against it.

08:56.492 --> 08:57.798
But it turned out okay.

08:57.841 --> 08:58.755
So far.

08:58.799 --> 09:00.583
Glad it's working out.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.324
You're welcome. Bye.

09:02.367 --> 09:03.455
I grabbed it out
of the trunk, hon.

09:03.499 --> 09:05.675
- What's this?
- My bench.

09:05.719 --> 09:07.851
- Oh, it's a bench we have
in our backyard. We wanted

09:07.895 --> 09:10.550
to give it to you.
It was Pete's favorite spot

09:10.593 --> 09:12.595
to just sit and enjoy nature.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.162
- Yeah, we thought
it might be nice

09:14.205 --> 09:15.598
to dedicate it to Pete.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.513
Eh, maybe have
a little ceremony,

09:17.557 --> 09:18.688
say a few words.

09:18.732 --> 09:21.169
Classic Jer.
That's so sweet.

09:21.212 --> 09:23.345
But if it's too much, we
can just take the manual.

09:23.388 --> 09:24.781
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, that's a great idea.

09:24.825 --> 09:25.826
Pete loves it.

09:27.218 --> 09:28.611
I'm sure he-he would.

09:28.655 --> 09:29.830
If I knew him.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.745
And if he were still alive.

09:33.877 --> 09:36.401
If you were a tree,
what would you be?

09:36.445 --> 09:38.578
- I'd be a peach tree.
- A peach tree?

09:38.621 --> 09:41.493
- Yeah.
- There's such thing
as a peach tree?

09:41.537 --> 09:42.799
Trevor.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.409
Feast your eyes
on Sienna.

09:44.453 --> 09:46.934
She is most attractive, yes?

09:46.977 --> 09:48.936
Those child-birthing hips.

09:48.979 --> 09:50.677
Thor, that's someone's daughter,
okay?

09:50.720 --> 09:52.592
Grow up.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.245
Oh, my God. That is so cute!

09:54.289 --> 09:55.377
- Right?
Yes!

09:55.420 --> 09:56.639
What is this?

09:56.683 --> 09:57.858
You not recognize?

09:57.901 --> 09:59.686
<i>It Is Getting Hot In Here!</i>

09:59.729 --> 10:02.427
Very good show.
You've missed a lot.

10:02.471 --> 10:04.516
What? Where did
all their clothes go?

10:04.560 --> 10:05.866
Where are
Sienna's snow pants?

10:05.909 --> 10:07.389
Ashley I. is blonde?

10:07.432 --> 10:08.564
She take off beanie.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.218
It's getting pretty hot.

10:10.261 --> 10:11.741
H-How many episodes
did you watch?

10:11.785 --> 10:12.873
Many.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.744
But we were watching together.

10:14.788 --> 10:16.659
Now we watch together. Sit.

10:16.703 --> 10:17.965
But it's not the same.
I'm not caught up.

10:18.008 --> 10:20.358
I catch you up.
What is last one you see?

10:20.402 --> 10:21.664
Oh, you know about Zane

10:21.708 --> 10:23.623
losing hot chocolate
challenge.

10:23.666 --> 10:26.582
Well, I do now. Unbelievable!

10:26.626 --> 10:27.670
So rude!

10:27.714 --> 10:29.411
Bye, Sass!

10:29.454 --> 10:31.718
This is our living room.

10:31.761 --> 10:36.244
Wow. This place reminds me
of that old hotel we stayed in

10:36.287 --> 10:37.593
for Hooper's wedding.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.942
Oh, that was a night.

10:38.986 --> 10:41.728
Remember, Pete and I had
too many margaritas...

10:41.771 --> 10:43.643
Yes, and you drove
a golf cart......and we drove a golf cart...

10:43.686 --> 10:45.601
- right into the pond.
...into the pond!

10:45.645 --> 10:47.647
Pete, you had a side.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.257
Ask about my daughter, Laura.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.738
So, did you and Pete
- have any children?
- Oh, yes.

10:51.781 --> 10:54.654
A daughter, Laura. Oh, Pete
loved her something fierce.

10:54.697 --> 10:57.439
- I did.
- She really wanted to
be here, but, you know,

10:57.482 --> 10:58.875
she lives in Philly.
She had to work.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.703
Mm. Four hours?

11:00.747 --> 11:02.749
That's-that's okay.
It's a long drive. I get it.

11:02.792 --> 11:03.967
Here she is.

11:04.011 --> 11:05.621
Oh, she's beautiful.

11:05.665 --> 11:06.448
Wow.

11:06.491 --> 11:07.928
Aw, the braces worked.

11:07.971 --> 11:08.885
Oh, I-I wonder
if she became an astronaut.

11:08.929 --> 11:10.800
Huh? That was her dream.

11:10.844 --> 11:12.628
And what does
Laura do for work?

11:12.672 --> 11:13.760
She's a food chemist.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.413
Oh, that makes so much sense.

11:15.457 --> 11:17.589
She loved science.
And food!

11:17.633 --> 11:20.375
Well, speaking of food, I, uh,
prepared a lovely charcuterie,

11:20.418 --> 11:21.942
- if you guys are interested.
- I don't know
what that is.

11:21.985 --> 11:24.292
He's offering
you meat, Jer.

11:24.335 --> 11:26.033
Lead the way.
Jerry.

11:26.076 --> 11:28.383
"I have no idea."

11:28.426 --> 11:30.515
Jerry doesn't know anything.

11:30.559 --> 11:33.431
Hey. Sam, um...

11:33.475 --> 11:34.955
now that I'm a father
to a daughter myself,

11:34.998 --> 11:37.653
I just want to apologize if I've
said anything objectifying

11:37.697 --> 11:40.351
or-or inappropriate
to you since we've met.

11:40.395 --> 11:43.485
Wow. Trevor, I really
appreciate that.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.008
Yeah. You like that, huh?

11:45.052 --> 11:46.488
Sorry. Sorry.

11:46.531 --> 11:47.968
I'm a work in progress.

11:48.011 --> 11:49.491
Okay, Thor,

11:49.534 --> 11:50.971
listen, I know
things kind of got

11:51.014 --> 11:52.537
out of hand between
us with the show,

11:52.581 --> 11:54.322
but I've decided to
be the bigger man.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.498
Ridiculous.

11:56.541 --> 11:58.500
Thor much, much bigger.

11:58.543 --> 12:00.763
Oh, what I'm saying is
I'm willing to move on

12:00.807 --> 12:02.417
if you'd just give me
a sincere apology.

12:02.460 --> 12:03.897
But Thor
do nothing wrong.

12:03.940 --> 12:06.464
I have fun watching show,
so I watch show.

12:06.508 --> 12:07.683
Yeah, but y...

12:07.727 --> 12:09.380
you watched ahead.

12:09.424 --> 12:10.642
Because fun watching show!

12:10.686 --> 12:11.687
But the fun isn't just
watching the show--

12:11.731 --> 12:13.471
it's watching the show <i>together.</i>

12:13.515 --> 12:14.734
At least it was for me.

12:14.777 --> 12:17.084
Fine. I watch episodes again.

12:17.127 --> 12:18.868
No, you've already seen it, so
we can't be surprised together

12:18.912 --> 12:20.043
when something big happens.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.479
Like when Sienna kiss Doug.

12:21.523 --> 12:22.829
Come on!

12:22.872 --> 12:24.656
We've known each
other 500 years,

12:24.700 --> 12:26.441
and you've never
once apologized.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.051
Norseman not apology.

12:28.095 --> 12:29.966
Apology for children and Danes.

12:30.010 --> 12:32.447
Whatever. Enjoy
watching by yourself!

12:32.490 --> 12:33.535
Thor will enjoy.

12:33.578 --> 12:35.885
Temperature's up to 90 degrees.

12:35.929 --> 12:38.018
It <i>is</i> getting hot in there!

12:38.061 --> 12:39.541
<i>So I'm thinking,</i>

12:39.584 --> 12:41.804
once the B&B is open,
this will be a great space

12:41.848 --> 12:43.763
for, like, an
afternoon drink.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.373
Mmm, I would literally kill
anyone in this room

12:45.416 --> 12:47.070
for a Sazerac right now.

12:47.114 --> 12:51.422
Oh, it's kind of overwhelming
being here.

12:51.466 --> 12:52.859
Where...

12:52.902 --> 12:55.600
the whole thing happened
to Pete.

12:55.644 --> 12:56.993
I know.

12:57.037 --> 12:58.690
I bet it's really hard.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.910
But I bet Pete
would be really happy

13:00.954 --> 13:02.607
that you and
Jerry both came.

13:03.652 --> 13:04.740
Oh...

13:04.784 --> 13:06.829
I wouldn't be so sure.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.657
What? What does that mean?

13:08.700 --> 13:09.658
What do you mean?

13:09.701 --> 13:12.400
It's just...

13:12.443 --> 13:14.054
there's something weighing
on me.

13:15.098 --> 13:16.578
Something shameful.

13:16.621 --> 13:18.623
Regarding Pete.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.495
We don't need
to involve them.

13:20.538 --> 13:22.410
I'm sure, whatever it is,
it's fine.

13:22.453 --> 13:23.890
I want to get it
off my chest.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.152
Oh, God.

13:25.195 --> 13:26.414
You know, I think
it might be okay

13:26.457 --> 13:27.763
to keep some things
on your chest,

13:27.807 --> 13:29.286
'cause we don't
- really know each other.
- Yes,

13:29.330 --> 13:31.811
but sometimes it's just easier
to say things to strangers.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.725
I'm with Jerry.
I think that sometimes... Jerry and I

13:33.769 --> 13:35.815
were having an affair
while Pete was still alive.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.425
- Oh, good God.
- Oh, God!

13:40.515 --> 13:41.951
Truthfully,
I think Pete knew.

13:43.039 --> 13:45.128
Uh, I did not know.

13:45.172 --> 13:47.957
I feel better.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.663
Well, here they come.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.404
Oh, yeah, find a spot for it.

14:00.448 --> 14:03.668
My so-called best friend
and my so-called wife!

14:03.712 --> 14:05.670
- Mm.
- Well, I mean, she was
literally his wife,

14:05.714 --> 14:06.976
any act of indiscretion
notwithstanding.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.630
Oh, is that so, Isaac?!

14:08.673 --> 14:10.066
I mean, grammatically, yes,

14:10.110 --> 14:12.025
but not hugely
important right now.

14:12.068 --> 14:14.201
Pete, you're taking
this too hard.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.203
Jerry probably just
offered something sexually

14:16.246 --> 14:18.161
that you couldn't, and
that's a good thing.

14:18.205 --> 14:19.597
He took it off
your plate.

14:19.641 --> 14:22.731
Flower!
If you weren't already dead,

14:22.774 --> 14:23.906
I would kill you!

14:23.950 --> 14:24.951
So, Jer and Carol

14:24.994 --> 14:28.128
were having
a torrid affair.

14:28.171 --> 14:30.173
Whoa. Poor Pete.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.306
Okay, you were right. Happy?

14:32.349 --> 14:35.222
I meddled and I made a complete
disaster out of everything.

14:35.265 --> 14:36.223
Sam, I was thinking--

14:36.266 --> 14:38.703
I have been such
an absentee DILF.

14:38.747 --> 14:40.792
And seeing as you helped Pete
reach out to his family,

14:40.836 --> 14:43.578
- maybe you help me out next.
- Please get out.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.580
Hey, whoever my wife
just yelled "get out" to...

14:45.623 --> 14:47.103
get out!

14:47.147 --> 14:48.670
Okay. That's fine. But later.

14:48.713 --> 14:49.671
Sidebar.

14:49.714 --> 14:50.890
Sidebar!

14:50.933 --> 14:52.108
I should've listened
to you from the start,

14:52.152 --> 14:53.588
and now
everybody's dead.

14:53.631 --> 14:56.156
Everyone slept with their
mom. And I'm an idiot.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.072
Look, babe,

14:59.115 --> 15:01.857
you remember, in <i>Jurassic Park,
when Goldblum told everyone</i>

15:01.901 --> 15:04.164
not to meddle
and they didn't listen to him?

15:04.207 --> 15:05.817
- Yeah, I said I messed up.
- No,

15:05.861 --> 15:07.950
what I'm saying is,
after the dinosaurs get out

15:07.994 --> 15:09.952
and Newman gets eaten
by the one that spits

15:09.996 --> 15:12.215
and Sam Jackson's arm is like...

15:12.259 --> 15:14.217
- Where is this going?
- They don't just go home.

15:14.261 --> 15:16.828
Right? They stay
and they fix it.

15:16.872 --> 15:19.614
So what I'm asking you is,
who are you?

15:19.657 --> 15:21.181
Are you the dude
who gets eaten on the toilet

15:21.224 --> 15:23.966
while the little girl in
the Jeep is like, "He left us!

15:24.010 --> 15:25.054
He left us! He left us!"?

15:25.098 --> 15:29.102
Or are you Dr. Ellie Sattler?

15:29.145 --> 15:30.886
Do you fix things?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.279
Hmm?

15:35.151 --> 15:38.285
Look, I know I slept with Shane
behind your back.

15:38.328 --> 15:41.766
But the hottest thing about
this place is our friendship.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.246
I'm sorry, Ashley I.

15:43.290 --> 15:46.119
Hearing you say that
means so much to me.

15:46.162 --> 15:47.816
I forgive you, Ashley S.

15:47.859 --> 15:50.079
Oh. I was so worried, Ashley I.

15:50.123 --> 15:52.038
Huh.

15:52.081 --> 15:55.171
Pete was one of a kind.

15:55.215 --> 15:57.391
He was the cornerstone
of the family.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.001
These words
- mean nothing.
- He was

15:59.045 --> 16:00.698
- so reliable.
- You know what else
meant nothing?

16:00.742 --> 16:02.048
- Our wedding vows.
- He was always there

16:02.091 --> 16:04.050
for everyone.

16:04.093 --> 16:05.747
You could
always find Pete

16:05.790 --> 16:07.314
- whenever you needed him.
- Yeah. There I was,

16:07.357 --> 16:08.880
a chump at every turn.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.404
I mean, in a way,
it's healthy.

16:10.447 --> 16:12.841
No one should be that
- chipper all the time.
- Mm-hmm.

16:12.884 --> 16:15.409
I guess "You may kiss the bride"
was directed at everybody!

16:15.452 --> 16:17.715
I would like to say a few words,
if that's okay.

16:17.759 --> 16:18.847
Pfft! Don't bother!

16:18.890 --> 16:20.153
Oh, of course.

16:20.196 --> 16:23.112
I obviously didn't know Pete
like you guys did.

16:23.156 --> 16:26.202
But I actually have gotten
to know him a little recently.

16:26.246 --> 16:27.334
Where's she going with this?

16:27.377 --> 16:29.336
Through his Pinecone Trooper
manual.

16:29.379 --> 16:30.206
- Ah.
- Oh...

16:31.425 --> 16:33.166
Pete highlighted passages
that I guess

16:33.209 --> 16:34.776
must have been important
to him.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.821
Like this list
of the seven attributes

16:36.865 --> 16:39.999
of a model Pinecone Trooper.

16:40.042 --> 16:44.046
A list that included things
like loyalty and friendship.

16:44.090 --> 16:46.353
Yeah, you hear that?
Loyalty. Hmm.

16:46.396 --> 16:49.704
But Pete circled and wrote
a note next to number seven,

16:49.747 --> 16:50.966
forgiveness.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.968
Clever girl.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.797
He wrote that "this is
more important than the rest.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.712
"Because though we strive
for perfection,

16:57.755 --> 16:59.714
"we all fall short
sometimes.

16:59.757 --> 17:03.239
"And when it happens, we don't
give up on our fellow trooper.

17:03.283 --> 17:04.849
We forgive."

17:04.893 --> 17:07.504
Thank you for that.

17:09.332 --> 17:11.073
You're welcome.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.913
Can we talk?

17:24.956 --> 17:27.437
In my culture,
apologize only for

17:27.481 --> 17:29.918
babies and... Danes. Yes,
we've been through this.

17:29.961 --> 17:33.095
But today I realize
that apologize for...

17:33.139 --> 17:34.270
friends, too.

17:35.271 --> 17:37.404
Thorfinn is...

17:37.447 --> 17:39.145
sorry.

17:39.188 --> 17:41.234
I really appreciate that.

17:41.277 --> 17:42.278
So you forgive?

17:42.322 --> 17:43.497
I do.

17:43.540 --> 17:45.107
All is... good?

17:45.151 --> 17:46.413
Everything's forgotten.

17:46.456 --> 17:48.371
Yes! Apologyso easy!

17:48.415 --> 17:50.243
Why not
apologize before?

17:50.286 --> 17:52.071
Fix everything!
Cost nothing!

17:52.114 --> 17:53.420
Well, you have to mean it.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.248
Thorfinn not
like your hat!

17:55.291 --> 17:57.119
- Excuse me?
- Sorry. All good.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.429
Oh, Pete.

18:03.952 --> 18:05.954
I know you can't hear me.

18:05.997 --> 18:09.392
But I want you to know

18:09.436 --> 18:11.960
I'm sorry.

18:12.003 --> 18:14.441
I'm so sorry.

18:14.484 --> 18:17.444
I would never want to hurt you.

18:17.487 --> 18:20.447
I forgive you, Carol.

18:26.844 --> 18:27.845
Laura!

18:29.020 --> 18:30.283
- Laura?
Surprise!

18:30.326 --> 18:31.893
You came!

18:31.936 --> 18:33.982
Well, once I heard you were
turning this into a ceremony

18:34.025 --> 18:35.897
for Dad, I didn't
want to miss it!

18:35.940 --> 18:37.028
All the way from Philly.

18:37.072 --> 18:38.247
Sorry we're late.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.989
Someone couldn't find
their special socks.

18:41.032 --> 18:42.382
Could you, Pete?

18:45.211 --> 18:47.561
Did you hear that?

18:47.604 --> 18:49.519
His name's Pete.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.522
I'm a grandpa.

18:53.523 --> 18:55.308
Oh! Grandpa Pete.

19:10.279 --> 19:13.021
And <i>you</i> thought this was
going to be a disaster.

19:13.064 --> 19:15.241
It was a disaster
until I saved it.

19:15.284 --> 19:16.242
I saved it.

19:16.285 --> 19:17.852
Because I told you to.

19:17.895 --> 19:18.896
I'm Goldblum.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.463
I'm clearly Goldblum.

19:20.507 --> 19:22.291
If it's <i>Jurassic Park
we're talking about,</i>

19:22.335 --> 19:24.119
then I'm Goldblum.
You might be him

19:24.163 --> 19:25.425
if this was <i>Ragnarok.</i>

19:25.468 --> 19:27.209
Why does he speak
of Ragnarok?

19:27.253 --> 19:28.428
Is it upon us?!

19:28.471 --> 19:30.081
Does that mean
something to Vikings?

19:30.125 --> 19:32.127
Yeah, probably.
It's from Norse mythology.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.347
It's a series of events that
brings out the end of the world.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.871
Everybody run!
The end is nigh!

19:36.914 --> 19:38.220
Go!

19:38.264 --> 19:40.266
Frozen giants!

19:40.309 --> 19:42.181
Flower girl...

19:42.224 --> 19:44.226
- Why do you ask?
- No reason.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.494
Well, the final four are
now naked. Don't go anywhere.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.279
We'll be right back
with the exciting finale of

19:53.322 --> 19:54.454
<i>It's Getting Hot In Here!</i>

19:54.497 --> 19:56.064
So I take it
the blurred-out parts

19:56.107 --> 19:58.109
are some sort
of accommodation for modesty.

19:58.153 --> 20:00.111
This is so lame.
You can't see anything.

20:00.155 --> 20:02.070
Yeah, put work
in watching whole season.

20:02.113 --> 20:04.159
Want to see sexy woman.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.553
Sorry, Trevor.
Someone's daughter.

20:06.596 --> 20:08.903
Oh, it's all right. It turns out
I'm actually not a DILF.

20:08.946 --> 20:10.078
Sam figured it out.

20:10.121 --> 20:11.384
I was flying high
on the whole Pete sitch,

20:11.427 --> 20:13.168
so I decided
to help Trevor.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.083
I went to message the daughter,
and I ended up looking

20:15.126 --> 20:16.432
at more of her pics...

20:16.476 --> 20:17.999
Turns out her dad
is just some other guy.

20:18.042 --> 20:19.174
Aw, I'm sorry, Trevor.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.481
She seemed like such
a lovely young woman.

20:21.524 --> 20:23.047
Yeah, she was lovely,
wasn't she?

20:23.091 --> 20:24.266
A beautiful soul.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.267
- Mm.
Kind of slamming,

20:25.311 --> 20:26.312
actually.

20:26.355 --> 20:27.922
Maybe we should
still have her up.

20:27.965 --> 20:29.532
But she's not
- your daughter.
- Exactly.

20:29.576 --> 20:31.621
She's hot and not my daughter.
She checks every box.

20:31.665 --> 20:34.276
What a tragedy
you didn't reproduce.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.365
Ooh!

20:36.409 --> 20:38.541
<i>- The knives are out.
Tensions are heating up</i>

20:38.585 --> 20:41.675
-<i>and there's no cooling 'em down.
Back on! Yes! Shush!</i>
