00:51.221 --> 00:52.347
Senor Ambassador.

00:52.555 --> 00:56.017
This is really most humiliating,
Signore Bedoli.

00:56.601 --> 00:57.978
What could be so important...

00:58.186 --> 01:01.231
...that you drag me from my bed
before 7:00 in the morning?

01:01.439 --> 01:04.566
The duke has called an early meeting.
He wanted you to attend.

01:07.112 --> 01:08.947
Monsieur.

01:10.031 --> 01:11.241
Why are the French here?

01:11.449 --> 01:14.327
That is what His Grace
wants to talk to you about.

01:47.819 --> 01:50.196
French bastards! Bastards.

02:32.906 --> 02:35.617
- Mr. Pace.
- Mr. More.

02:35.825 --> 02:39.162
His Majesty wants council
this afternoon to be brief.

02:39.370 --> 02:42.499
- He doesn't want a lot of speeches.
- Where is the king?

02:42.707 --> 02:45.460
He's in seclusion
and not to be disturbed.

02:45.919 --> 02:47.587
- How is he?
- With regards to...?

02:47.795 --> 02:51.132
With regard to Italy.
What the French are doing in Italy.

02:51.341 --> 02:54.594
- What other regard is there?
- His Majesty is counselling patience.

02:54.802 --> 02:57.514
Yes, but you're his secretary.
You see him every day.

02:57.722 --> 03:01.893
In private, he's mad with grief.
Almost inconsolable.

03:02.101 --> 03:05.688
I think you ought to remember
it was his uncle they murdered.

03:07.607 --> 03:09.359
The king.

03:10.652 --> 03:12.320
My lords.

03:21.287 --> 03:24.666
We meet to consider questions
of great moment.

03:24.999 --> 03:28.461
The king of France has demonstrated
to the world his aggressive policies.

03:29.254 --> 03:32.590
He's already overrun
five or six city-states in Italy.

03:32.799 --> 03:35.343
He's a threat to every
Christian nation in Europe...

03:35.551 --> 03:38.805
...yet he bullies the pope into
declaring him Defender of the Faith.

03:39.889 --> 03:43.977
On top of that,
to prove that nobody can touch him...

03:44.185 --> 03:47.772
...he has our ambassador in Urbino...

03:48.773 --> 03:50.733
...and my uncle...

03:51.192 --> 03:54.570
...murdered in cold blood.

03:57.907 --> 03:59.909
My lords...

04:00.743 --> 04:05.748
...I believe these are all just causes
for war.

04:07.959 --> 04:10.086
Your Majesty is certainly right.

04:10.586 --> 04:12.547
You have every reason
to prosecute a war.

04:12.755 --> 04:15.091
I warned you a year ago
about French ambitions.

04:15.299 --> 04:20.137
It has taken this personal tragedy
for Your Majesty to accept my word.

04:26.686 --> 04:28.438
Norfolk.

04:29.313 --> 04:33.317
I agree with my lord, Buckingham.
The king of England...

04:33.526 --> 04:36.362
...has an ancient and historic
right to the French throne...

04:36.571 --> 04:41.367
...which the Valois have usurped.
It's high time we kicked them out.

04:41.576 --> 04:43.995
We should attack France
with all our might.

04:44.203 --> 04:46.080
Yes.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.502
What say you, Wolsey?

04:56.132 --> 05:01.888
I concur with Your Majesty.
These are indeed just causes.

05:02.096 --> 05:03.598
Good.

05:04.599 --> 05:08.311
Then it is settled.
We are to war with France.

05:08.519 --> 05:10.104
Yes.

05:11.105 --> 05:13.900
Your Eminence
will make all the arrangements.

05:14.650 --> 05:16.194
Now...

05:17.403 --> 05:18.738
...I can go play.

05:27.079 --> 05:29.415
Do you really think
we should go to war?

05:29.624 --> 05:32.335
I think we should try to do
what the king wants us to do.

05:32.543 --> 05:34.879
What if the king
doesn't know his best interests?

05:35.087 --> 05:37.632
Then we should help him decide.

06:42.780 --> 06:44.991
How is your husband?

06:45.491 --> 06:50.079
My husband is extremely jealous.

06:51.998 --> 06:54.500
He's threatening to make a scandal.

06:55.001 --> 06:57.378
Says he'll put me in a nunnery.

07:00.715 --> 07:04.051
That would be such a waste.

07:20.901 --> 07:24.655
His Excellency the French ambassador
and Bishop Bonnivet.

07:27.575 --> 07:29.118
Gentlemen, welcome.

07:30.536 --> 07:31.620
Your Excellency.

07:32.288 --> 07:34.165
What happened in Urbino?

07:34.373 --> 07:38.878
The butchering of our ambassador
was most unfortunate...

07:39.086 --> 07:41.839
...especially for me.

07:42.048 --> 07:45.009
Your Excellency is aware of
my sentiments towards your country.

07:45.217 --> 07:49.847
I've laboured long and consistently
in French interests.

07:50.431 --> 07:53.809
But how to explain this?
The murder of my king's uncle.

07:54.018 --> 07:56.687
Well, frankly, it was not done
on my master's orders.

07:57.104 --> 08:00.483
And those that committed the crime
have been punished.

08:00.691 --> 08:04.695
Now, you must understand,
we are well beyond that.

08:05.488 --> 08:08.657
King Henry is a young man.
He has an appetite for war.

08:08.866 --> 08:13.662
And on this occasion
he will not be easy to appease.

08:14.497 --> 08:18.667
Then, by all means, let us have war.

08:19.627 --> 08:22.963
With the greatest respect,
you don't mean that.

08:23.672 --> 08:27.551
Well, I believe that everything
humanly possible should be done...

08:27.760 --> 08:30.763
...to avoid a war between
our two countries.

08:30.971 --> 08:36.184
It would do England no good to get
involved in our European squabbles.

08:36.393 --> 08:38.770
Far better she stands above them.

08:39.772 --> 08:46.028
I'm sure Your Eminence
has ways of pacifying the young lion.

09:00.543 --> 09:02.753
- Strike.
- Play on.

09:02.962 --> 09:04.255
Fifteen-love.

09:12.012 --> 09:14.223
- Thirty-love.
- Yeah!

09:21.146 --> 09:22.439
Our game, I think, Anthony.

09:22.648 --> 09:24.692
Your Majesty knows
we're letting you win.

09:24.900 --> 09:27.403
Actually,
I was playing as hard as I can.

09:30.114 --> 09:33.659
Now, there is someone I have to try.
See her? Middle gallery, blue dress?

09:33.867 --> 09:36.370
See that exquisite, virginal face?

09:37.913 --> 09:39.665
Who is she?

09:41.875 --> 09:43.502
Forty-love, game.

09:47.298 --> 09:49.091
She's Buckingham's daughter.

09:51.677 --> 09:55.306
- A hundred crowns you don't succeed.
- Done.

10:00.060 --> 10:01.562
How is our daughter?

10:01.812 --> 10:03.439
She's well.

10:03.647 --> 10:07.401
You know, her tutors say
she has exceptional talents.

10:07.609 --> 10:09.611
Especially in music.

10:11.113 --> 10:12.197
You should be proud.

10:13.574 --> 10:16.785
I am. You know I am Catherine.

10:16.994 --> 10:19.079
Mary's the pearl of my world.

10:28.589 --> 10:31.133
You have not answered
my nephew's letters.

10:31.342 --> 10:35.220
Your nephew's the king of Spain. Does
he think I have nothing better to do?

10:35.596 --> 10:38.766
You know he advises you
to sign a treaty with the emperor...

10:38.974 --> 10:41.477
...recognising France
as our mutual enemy.

10:41.977 --> 10:45.939
He also advises you not to heed
everything Wolsey tells you...

10:46.148 --> 10:49.193
...because Wolsey
is so biased for the French.

10:51.362 --> 10:53.572
Since when are you a diplomat?

10:54.615 --> 10:58.160
- I am my father's daughter.
- You are my wife.

10:59.036 --> 11:03.916
You are not my minister,
you are not my chancellor, but my wife.

11:11.632 --> 11:15.094
I should like to be your wife
in every way.

11:17.763 --> 11:23.018
Henry, will you not visit
my bedchamber, as you used to?

11:25.437 --> 11:26.855
Eat.

12:20.659 --> 12:22.244
Gown.

12:50.230 --> 12:52.316
Your Majesty.

12:55.110 --> 12:56.445
Where is Queen Catherine?

12:56.653 --> 12:59.948
Her Majesty is still at prayer,
Your Majesty.

13:00.991 --> 13:03.076
Tell Her Majesty...

13:03.285 --> 13:07.247
...I came to offer my love and devotion,
as her true husband.

13:07.456 --> 13:09.166
Yes, Your Majesty.

14:09.309 --> 14:10.936
Jane.

14:11.144 --> 14:13.105
Your Majesty.

14:22.489 --> 14:26.451
- Do you consent?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

14:44.719 --> 14:49.099
Three points, Earl of Portland.

14:53.812 --> 15:00.360
Mr. Charles Brandon
has now entered the lists.

15:09.786 --> 15:11.913
Your Majesties.

15:15.625 --> 15:17.419
My Lady Buckingham.

15:18.044 --> 15:21.131
Would you do me the honour
of letting me wear your favours today?

15:59.169 --> 16:05.300
Lord Hallam challenges a plaisance.

16:33.870 --> 16:37.248
Two points, Mr. Charles Brandon.

16:46.841 --> 16:49.177
His Grace, the Duke of Buckingham...

16:49.386 --> 16:53.681
...will now joust a plaisance
with the Earl of Newcastle.

17:10.365 --> 17:14.327
Another three points for His Grace.

17:29.175 --> 17:32.470
Does Your Eminence have a plan?

17:32.679 --> 17:36.224
A way to avoid war?

17:38.268 --> 17:41.396
This is the outline
of a new peace treaty...

17:42.105 --> 17:44.065
...uniting the English with the French.

17:44.274 --> 17:46.818
- May I?
- No.

17:47.026 --> 17:50.864
I want you to take it away
and read it very carefully.

17:51.823 --> 17:55.910
I believe it represents something new
in the world of diplomacy.

17:56.119 --> 18:00.832
If your king accepts it in principle,
he can sign it without any loss of face.

18:01.416 --> 18:05.587
Indeed, he can rejoice.
My master can rejoice.

18:05.795 --> 18:07.881
We can all rejoice.

18:08.089 --> 18:11.801
In which case, what does
Your Eminence want in return?

18:12.510 --> 18:15.096
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

18:15.555 --> 18:17.432
Nothing from you.

18:20.018 --> 18:24.814
What I want, Your Grace,
only you can give me.

18:27.942 --> 18:32.030
The Duke of Buckingham
has reentered the lists.

18:32.238 --> 18:34.908
He's won 10 courses already.
What is he trying to prove?

18:35.116 --> 18:37.452
- I'm gonna take him.
- No. I'll do it.

18:37.660 --> 18:40.622
I'd love to damage
Buckingham's pride.

18:42.165 --> 18:47.545
My lords,
the king has entered the lists.

18:59.682 --> 19:05.229
His Majesty makes the challenge
a la guerre.

19:09.943 --> 19:11.861
Here we go again.

19:12.070 --> 19:15.573
Claim or no claim,
Buckingham's not the king.

19:15.782 --> 19:19.077
Not all of the court is as loyal as you,
Charles.

19:31.964 --> 19:33.675
My lady.

20:35.736 --> 20:38.156
His Majesty wins the day.

21:08.019 --> 21:09.812
The king.

21:14.650 --> 21:15.776
And easy.

21:18.029 --> 21:20.072
Present oars.

21:30.124 --> 21:32.084
- Thomas.
- Your Majesty.

21:33.502 --> 21:35.630
This is my family.

21:35.838 --> 21:37.632
Your Majesty.

21:37.840 --> 21:41.385
My wife, Alice.
Alice, won't you kiss the king?

21:41.594 --> 21:43.554
Mistress Alice.

21:45.473 --> 21:47.350
Your Majesty.

21:50.186 --> 21:54.065
Shall we walk by the river, Thomas?
I like walking.

21:58.611 --> 22:00.488
Why won't you come live at court?

22:00.696 --> 22:03.950
You know perfectly well why.
I don't like it.

22:05.618 --> 22:08.496
My legal practise
and my life are here.

22:08.704 --> 22:11.332
The court is for
more ambitious men.

22:11.540 --> 22:13.709
You didn't say much in council
last month.

22:13.918 --> 22:16.671
- About what?
- Going to war with France.

22:18.130 --> 22:20.758
As a humanist,
I have an abhorrence of war.

22:21.384 --> 22:23.678
It's an activity fit only for beasts...

22:23.886 --> 22:28.724
...yet practised by no kind of beast
so constantly as by man.

22:28.933 --> 22:33.396
As a humanist, I share your opinion.
As a king, I'm forced to disagree.

22:33.604 --> 22:34.772
Spoken like a lawyer.

22:34.981 --> 22:37.817
- You should know. You taught me.
- Not well enough, it seems.

22:38.025 --> 22:40.236
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

22:45.449 --> 22:47.660
- Harry. Harry.
- Easy.

22:47.868 --> 22:48.994
I must urge you...

22:49.203 --> 22:52.540
...that instead of spending ruinous
amounts of money going to war...

22:52.748 --> 22:55.710
...you should spend it
rather on the welfare of your people.

22:57.628 --> 23:01.090
Thomas, I swear to you...

23:01.298 --> 23:03.217
...I intend to be a just ruler.

23:04.844 --> 23:08.180
But tell me this:
Why is Henry V remembered?

23:08.389 --> 23:11.976
Because he endowed universities?
Built alms houses for the destitute?

23:12.810 --> 23:17.273
No. He is remembered because
he won the battle of Agincourt.

23:17.481 --> 23:19.942
Three thousand English bowmen
against 60,000 French.

23:20.151 --> 23:23.821
The flower of French chivalry
destroyed in four hours.

23:27.366 --> 23:30.035
That victory made him famous,
Thomas.

23:30.244 --> 23:32.538
It made him immortal.

23:41.755 --> 23:43.966
He has no right to any of this.

23:45.593 --> 23:47.803
His father seized the crown
on the battlefield.

23:48.012 --> 23:51.015
He had no claim, only through
a bastard on his mother's side.

23:51.223 --> 23:53.767
Your Grace's family is more ancient.

23:53.976 --> 23:57.813
I am a direct descendant of Edward II.
This is my crown, and this is my court.

23:58.022 --> 24:00.316
Not his crown or his court.

24:02.568 --> 24:06.655
- That's treason, Your Grace.
- It's the truth.

24:08.824 --> 24:10.659
And one day...

24:11.494 --> 24:14.079
...we shall make it come true.

24:22.671 --> 24:24.215
Your Grace.

24:24.673 --> 24:26.008
My Lord.

24:34.558 --> 24:36.185
My Lord.

24:48.822 --> 24:49.865
What's this?

24:50.074 --> 24:54.203
- Brandon.
- It's what it looks like, Your Grace.

24:58.707 --> 25:00.334
You violated my daughter.

25:01.043 --> 25:02.836
No, no, she begged.

25:04.046 --> 25:05.464
You've taken her honour.

25:05.673 --> 25:08.425
I swear to Your Grace,
someone else was there before me.

25:12.471 --> 25:14.139
You son of a whore.

25:14.848 --> 25:19.687
- Yes, that is true, Your Grace.
- I should kill you for this.

25:25.442 --> 25:26.485
Get out.

26:01.895 --> 26:05.524
Eminence, Lady Blount is here.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.319
Very well.

26:15.909 --> 26:16.952
Your Eminence.

26:17.995 --> 26:20.205
What can I do for you, Lady Blount?

26:22.040 --> 26:26.920
I am with child, Your Eminence.

26:28.130 --> 26:29.923
Yes.

26:31.925 --> 26:33.677
It is His Majesty's child.

26:37.055 --> 26:40.309
- You are certain?
- Yes.

26:41.769 --> 26:43.187
Have you told the king?

26:43.812 --> 26:45.147
No.

26:46.064 --> 26:47.483
Good.

26:50.736 --> 26:54.156
I will inform His Majesty in due time.

26:54.782 --> 26:58.410
In the meantime, you will say nothing
to anybody on pain of death.

26:58.619 --> 27:00.329
Do you understand?

27:03.582 --> 27:06.043
When you are no longer
able to hide your condition...

27:06.251 --> 27:13.300
...you will be removed
to a private place for your lying-in.

27:13.926 --> 27:16.345
And there you can give birth
to your bastard.

27:22.726 --> 27:24.353
Thank you, Your Eminence.

27:58.971 --> 28:01.765
Will you bless my sick child?

28:09.147 --> 28:11.692
Your Eminence, please.

28:11.900 --> 28:15.737
All my lords and masters,
make way for his Lord's Grace.

28:17.948 --> 28:20.325
Away. Get back.

28:20.534 --> 28:22.828
Please, you're my last chance.

28:23.412 --> 28:25.914
- Your Eminence.
- Mr. Pace.

28:26.123 --> 28:28.500
I trust you're keeping a good eye
on my interests?

28:28.709 --> 28:30.627
Of course, Your Eminence.
Like an eagle.

28:30.836 --> 28:32.462
Or an eagle, Mr. Pace.

28:33.714 --> 28:37.426
They can soar too high.
Be a pigeon and shit on everything.

28:37.634 --> 28:38.969
Yes.

28:40.846 --> 28:44.641
- Where's the king?
- Out hunting.

28:44.850 --> 28:47.227
Good. It keeps him in good humour.

28:47.477 --> 28:50.814
- Send word when he returns.
- Yes, Eminence.

28:56.570 --> 28:59.948
Who are you? What is it you want?

29:00.157 --> 29:03.493
I have letters of introduction, sir.

29:05.454 --> 29:08.040
But these are from the dean
of Canterbury Cathedral.

29:08.248 --> 29:12.586
- Yes, sir.
- Why did you not present yourself?

30:09.893 --> 30:13.480
- Thomas Tallis.
- Yes, sir.

30:15.065 --> 30:19.069
And you can play, it says,
the organ and the flute...

30:19.277 --> 30:23.281
...and can sing
more than moderately well.

30:23.865 --> 30:25.492
Anything else?

30:26.117 --> 30:29.913
Yes, sir. I compose a little.

30:30.497 --> 30:32.082
Indeed.

30:33.041 --> 30:37.337
Well,
if the dean commends your talents...

30:37.546 --> 30:40.507
...we shall have to see, won't we?

30:44.427 --> 30:45.971
Thomas.

30:49.099 --> 30:51.309
I trust Your Majesty
enjoyed hunting today.

30:51.851 --> 30:53.436
How are the preparations going?

30:53.645 --> 30:56.648
Very well. Both your army
and fleet are assembling.

30:56.856 --> 30:59.901
Stores and provisions are being laid in.
You could go to war...

31:00.110 --> 31:01.528
...in a matter of weeks.

31:01.736 --> 31:04.614
Excellent.
I knew I could depend on you.

31:04.823 --> 31:07.450
I am grateful to Your Majesty.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.253
What is it?

31:18.461 --> 31:21.881
Your Majesty, wars are expensive.

31:22.841 --> 31:24.676
To pay for them
you have to raise taxes.

31:24.884 --> 31:28.346
That's not always popular.

31:28.555 --> 31:33.810
What if Your Majesty could gain more
power and prestige by other means?

31:34.019 --> 31:35.562
Other means?

31:36.146 --> 31:37.564
Peaceful means.

31:37.772 --> 31:41.735
What? No battles? No glory?

31:41.943 --> 31:45.238
I think Your Majesty
should hear him out.

31:49.117 --> 31:54.289
In the past few weeks, I have
conducted, on Your Majesty's behalf...

31:54.497 --> 31:56.875
...an intense round of diplomatic talks.

31:57.083 --> 31:58.793
Not just with the French ambassador.

31:59.002 --> 32:01.796
Also,
with representatives of the emperor.

32:02.005 --> 32:05.425
With envoys from Denmark, Portugal,
the Italian States and so on.

32:05.633 --> 32:07.218
What for?

32:07.427 --> 32:10.597
- To make a treaty.
- What kind of treaty?

32:10.805 --> 32:14.434
A treaty of universal
and perpetual peace.

32:22.609 --> 32:23.777
How is it to be effected?

32:23.985 --> 32:27.447
In several stages. In the first place,
there would be a summit meeting...

32:27.655 --> 32:29.657
...between the kings of France
and England.

32:29.866 --> 32:32.869
At the summit, Your Majesty's daughter
would be betrothed...

32:33.078 --> 32:34.370
...to the French dauphin.

32:34.579 --> 32:37.248
At the end of the summit,
you would both sign the treaty.

32:37.457 --> 32:40.543
The treaty is entirely new
in the history of Europe.

32:40.752 --> 32:42.587
Committing all its signatories...

32:42.796 --> 32:46.674
...to the principles of collective
security and universal peace.

32:49.427 --> 32:51.054
How would it be enforced?

32:51.888 --> 32:54.432
If any of the signatory countries
suffer aggression...

32:54.641 --> 32:58.061
...all the others would immediately
demand that the aggressor withdraws.

32:58.269 --> 33:01.773
If he refuses, within one month
the rest would declare against him...

33:01.981 --> 33:04.484
...and continue
until peace is restored.

33:04.692 --> 33:10.657
The treaty also envisages the creation
of pan-European institutions.

33:22.418 --> 33:24.128
In some ways I like it.

33:24.796 --> 33:26.381
I recognise it.

33:26.923 --> 33:30.093
- So do you, Thomas.
- Indeed.

33:30.301 --> 33:34.639
It's the application of humanist
principles to international affairs.

33:36.975 --> 33:38.685
Your Eminence
is to be congratulated.

33:41.312 --> 33:43.565
I do not seek praise.

33:43.773 --> 33:47.151
Your Majesty would be known as the
architect of a new and modern world.

33:47.360 --> 33:50.363
And that would be reward enough.

33:52.574 --> 33:56.202
Always be assured of our love.

33:59.122 --> 34:00.206
Good night, gentlemen.

34:03.126 --> 34:04.794
- What is it?
- Your Majesty...

34:05.003 --> 34:07.672
...the Duke of Buckingham
insists upon an audience.

34:15.722 --> 34:16.848
Your Grace.

34:17.514 --> 34:20.935
Your Majesty ought to be aware that I
have discovered Charles Brandon...

34:21.143 --> 34:23.228
...in flagrante delicto
with my daughter.

34:26.024 --> 34:28.943
Mr. Brandon has brought
shame to my family.

34:29.152 --> 34:31.571
I demand that Your Majesty
banish him from court...

34:31.779 --> 34:34.407
...with whatever other punishment
Your Majesty sees fit.

34:34.614 --> 34:35.992
There will be no punishment.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.578
Unless your daughter
accuses Mr. Brandon of rape.

34:38.786 --> 34:40.288
Does she so claim?

34:41.621 --> 34:43.833
Does your daughter claim
Mr. Brandon raped her?

34:44.042 --> 34:47.210
She doesn't need to. The offence
is against me and my family.

34:47.420 --> 34:49.630
As far as I know,
there has been no offence.

34:49.839 --> 34:53.217
So there is no need
for any punishment.

34:58.514 --> 35:01.601
- Your Majesty.
- Your Grace.

35:09.776 --> 35:12.028
Be careful of Buckingham, Harry.

35:12.236 --> 35:16.115
He may be stupid,
but he is richer than you are.

35:16.532 --> 35:21.871
And he can call upon a private army.
Not even your father crossed him.

35:30.671 --> 35:32.590
I'm very happy
that the King of France...

35:32.799 --> 35:35.426
...has agreed to sign the treaty
and to host the summit.

35:35.635 --> 35:38.596
His Majesty is delighted
there will be no war.

35:38.805 --> 35:40.640
As we all are.

35:43.267 --> 35:45.228
About the other matter we discussed.

35:45.436 --> 35:48.481
Which other matter, Your Eminence?

35:52.485 --> 35:56.906
I saved your master's arse.
Now I want my reward...

35:57.115 --> 35:59.283
...and you can arrange it.

36:00.326 --> 36:02.370
Do you understand?

36:18.845 --> 36:20.888
Poor you.

36:23.850 --> 36:28.646
Now, where were we
when we were so rudely interrupted?

36:35.778 --> 36:36.863
Charles.

36:37.697 --> 36:39.448
We shouldn't.

36:48.666 --> 36:51.252
My father will kill you.

36:58.926 --> 37:01.762
Then I shall die a happy man.

37:09.437 --> 37:12.773
Now,
have you all finished your reading?

37:14.150 --> 37:16.193
- Yes, Father.
- Yes, Father.

37:16.402 --> 37:17.903
Yes.

37:18.863 --> 37:20.573
Very well.

37:21.866 --> 37:27.663
May God and his angels bless you
and keep you this night and always.

37:32.251 --> 37:33.878
Good night.

37:39.884 --> 37:41.802
Good night, children.

37:42.136 --> 37:43.721
Stop.

38:32.311 --> 38:36.107
The letter to King Francis,
Your Majesty?

38:39.276 --> 38:41.821
My dearest royal cousin...

38:42.029 --> 38:43.447
No.

38:43.906 --> 38:45.699
Make that my beloved cousin.

38:46.951 --> 38:49.078
We send you our love.

38:49.537 --> 38:52.790
We love you so much it would be
impossible to love you better.

38:54.166 --> 38:58.003
Make all the necessary arrangements
so we may meet face to face.

38:58.212 --> 39:00.756
Nothing is now closer
or more dear to my heart...

39:00.965 --> 39:04.468
...than this treaty of universal peace.

39:07.930 --> 39:09.557
As a token of my goodwill...

39:10.057 --> 39:15.354
...my commitment to this treaty
and my love for Your Majesty...

39:17.565 --> 39:18.941
...I have decided...

39:23.195 --> 39:26.198
I have decided...

39:29.785 --> 39:31.662
Yes, Your Majesty?

39:31.871 --> 39:34.832
I've decided I will not shave again
until we meet.

39:36.417 --> 39:40.170
My beard will be a token
of universal friendship...

39:41.171 --> 39:43.799
...of the love between us.

39:50.764 --> 39:52.641
- Your Eminence.
- Your Grace.

39:52.850 --> 39:55.436
I have some news for Your Eminence.

40:01.692 --> 40:05.404
His Holiness, Pope Alexander,
is desperately ill.

40:07.781 --> 40:11.327
It cannot be long
before he is summoned to God's house.

40:14.705 --> 40:18.876
In view of Your Eminence's
well-known piety...

40:19.084 --> 40:22.171
...as well as your great learning
and diplomatic skills...

40:23.380 --> 40:25.007
...I can assure Your Eminence...

40:25.215 --> 40:28.052
...of the support of the French
cardinals at the conclave...

40:28.260 --> 40:30.179
...to elect a successor.

40:31.138 --> 40:33.182
With the votes of your own cardinals...

40:33.390 --> 40:36.727
...and if it is pleasing to God...

40:36.935 --> 40:41.148
...you will be elected pope.
Bishop of Rome.

40:41.649 --> 40:43.776
Our new Holy Father.

40:46.862 --> 40:48.864
Thank you, Your Grace.

40:49.657 --> 40:53.494
You make me feel truly humble.

41:06.882 --> 41:11.345
- Are you ill, Lady Blount?
- No, Your Majesty.

41:11.553 --> 41:13.222
Please stay.

41:21.271 --> 41:24.525
Thank you. Good night.

41:38.747 --> 41:41.375
I have not talked to anyone
for a long time.

41:41.583 --> 41:44.294
Cardinal Wolsey
dismissed my Spanish confessor...

41:44.503 --> 41:49.842
...and most of my Spanish ladies,
in case they were spies.

41:50.926 --> 41:53.679
And I cannot
trust my English confessor.

41:54.346 --> 41:58.684
But I can trust you though.
Can I not, Lady Blount?

42:00.352 --> 42:01.478
Yes, madam.

42:04.648 --> 42:06.859
What is my sadness?

42:09.111 --> 42:10.904
It is that I...

42:12.865 --> 42:15.951
I cannot give the king a living son.

42:17.661 --> 42:20.873
I gave birth to a baby boy once.

42:22.124 --> 42:24.168
Sweet boy.

42:28.589 --> 42:32.301
But he died in my arms...

42:34.636 --> 42:38.390
...after just four weeks of life.

42:39.558 --> 42:43.896
The king blames me, I know it.
He thinks it all my fault.

42:44.104 --> 42:48.275
He does not know how much I suffer,
how much I pray.

42:54.448 --> 42:57.242
I've been thinking about my brother.

42:57.910 --> 42:59.411
Arthur.

43:00.037 --> 43:04.416
When he died, it was decided
that I should marry Catherine.

43:05.834 --> 43:09.046
I think my father
didn't want to lose her dowry...

43:10.672 --> 43:15.218
...or the prestige
of a Spanish marriage.

43:17.346 --> 43:19.348
In any case...

43:21.058 --> 43:24.478
...Catherine swore
the marriage was never consummated.

43:26.396 --> 43:29.524
That's why a papal dispensation
was granted.

43:31.902 --> 43:34.071
And so I married her.

43:38.367 --> 43:43.455
And since then,
we have had five stillborn children.

43:43.914 --> 43:45.624
A boy...

43:48.669 --> 43:51.421
...who lived for 26 days.

43:56.593 --> 43:58.470
And a single living daughter.

44:01.723 --> 44:05.227
What if their marriage
was consummated?

44:07.145 --> 44:09.940
She has sworn before God
that it was not.

44:10.148 --> 44:12.317
What does it say in the Gospels?

44:13.235 --> 44:16.988
If a man should marry
his brother's wife.

44:17.781 --> 44:19.366
Tell me.

44:20.200 --> 44:23.328
In Leviticus it says:

44:23.537 --> 44:26.331
"If a man
marries his brother's wife...

44:26.540 --> 44:28.125
...they will die childless."

44:28.709 --> 44:30.627
But you have a child.

44:30.836 --> 44:32.838
But not a son.

44:33.797 --> 44:36.216
I have no son.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.610
Sir Thomas Boleyn, Your Grace.

44:56.570 --> 45:00.073
Sir Thomas. I hope you didn't find
my invitation presumptuous.

45:00.282 --> 45:02.242
I heard you've been
recalled from France.

45:02.451 --> 45:04.703
I'm here for a short while,
Your Grace.

45:07.539 --> 45:08.790
Come.

45:09.708 --> 45:12.461
They tell me
you're an excellent ambassador.

45:12.669 --> 45:15.589
Then, whoever they are,
they are very kind.

45:17.048 --> 45:20.635
You come from an old family.

45:21.636 --> 45:24.681
Though not as ancient,
nor as grand as Your Grace's.

45:24.890 --> 45:27.434
The king chooses
to surround himself with commoners.

45:27.642 --> 45:29.895
Men of no distinction.
New men without pedigree.

45:30.103 --> 45:32.647
How does that help
the prestige of his crown?

45:32.856 --> 45:35.317
- Your Grace...
- His father only acquired the crown...

45:35.525 --> 45:36.860
...by force, not by right.

45:37.068 --> 45:38.778
Your Grace...

45:38.987 --> 45:43.533
...no one wants to return
to the evil days of civil war.

45:43.742 --> 45:46.161
What is done is done.

45:46.369 --> 45:48.538
The king is the king.

45:50.540 --> 45:52.709
The king is the king.

45:55.253 --> 45:56.379
Wolsey.

45:59.174 --> 46:02.093
A man of the cloth
with a mistress and two children.

46:05.805 --> 46:08.016
How do you like this fellow?

46:09.559 --> 46:11.603
Not at all.

46:15.982 --> 46:18.109
We shall talk again.

46:25.992 --> 46:28.453
Tell me about King Francis,
Sir Thomas.

46:28.662 --> 46:29.913
He's 23 years old.

46:30.121 --> 46:31.748
Is he tall?

46:31.957 --> 46:33.458
Yes.

46:34.793 --> 46:36.252
But ill-proportioned.

46:38.129 --> 46:40.256
What about his legs?

46:40.590 --> 46:42.509
Are his calves strong, like mine?

46:42.717 --> 46:46.388
Your Majesty,
no one has calves like yours.

46:52.394 --> 46:54.229
Is he handsome?

46:55.063 --> 46:57.273
Some people might think so.

46:58.233 --> 47:01.361
- He certainly thinks so himself.
- He's vain?

47:02.404 --> 47:04.656
Your Majesty, he's French.

47:10.453 --> 47:11.746
What about his court?

47:12.831 --> 47:16.376
It has a reputation for loose morals
and licentiousness...

47:16.584 --> 47:20.255
...which the king, by his own
behaviour, does nothing to dispel.

47:21.005 --> 47:24.759
You have two daughters, Sir Thomas.
How do you protect them?

47:24.968 --> 47:27.387
I keep a watchful eye on them.

47:27.595 --> 47:31.266
But I also trust in their goodness
and virtue.

47:34.060 --> 47:36.813
You will return immediately to Paris.

47:37.021 --> 47:41.192
I'm entrusting you with all the
diplomatic negotiations for the summit.

47:49.117 --> 47:50.869
Checkmate.

47:51.953 --> 47:53.496
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

47:53.747 --> 47:56.207
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

47:57.333 --> 47:59.085
Mary.

47:59.961 --> 48:01.296
Papa.

48:01.504 --> 48:04.424
Aren't you beautiful?
The most beautiful girl in the world?

48:05.216 --> 48:08.261
- I don't know.
- Yes, you are. How do you feel?

48:08.470 --> 48:10.763
- Well.
- Well?

48:11.222 --> 48:13.057
Papa's busy.

48:13.266 --> 48:16.060
Be good.
And do everything you're told.

48:16.269 --> 48:17.937
May we speak?

48:21.649 --> 48:23.318
Continue.

48:25.945 --> 48:27.030
My Lady.

48:32.619 --> 48:34.954
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

48:43.671 --> 48:46.674
- I do not like it.
- What don't you like?

48:46.883 --> 48:48.927
Your beard.

48:50.345 --> 48:52.805
- Nor what it represents.
- Catherine.

48:53.014 --> 48:55.975
You are giving my daughter away
to the dauphin and to France.

48:56.184 --> 48:57.977
You did not even consult me.

48:59.103 --> 49:03.274
The Valois are the sworn enemies
of my family.

49:03.483 --> 49:07.946
She is mine to do with, as I see fit.
It's a great marriage.

49:10.281 --> 49:12.700
I see Wolsey's hand behind this.

49:16.371 --> 49:19.165
Though I love Your Majesty...

49:19.374 --> 49:23.962
...and am loyal to you in every way...

49:25.964 --> 49:30.260
...I cannot disguise my distress
and unhappiness.

49:31.302 --> 49:33.096
Well, you're going to have to.

49:52.031 --> 49:53.950
Where are my daughters?

49:55.535 --> 49:58.413
I have some exciting news.
There is to be a summit...

49:58.621 --> 50:02.583
...between King Francis and King Henry
near Calais. I am to arrange it.

50:03.501 --> 50:06.796
That means you'll have the opportunity
to meet the king of England.

50:09.632 --> 50:10.883
Mary...

50:15.054 --> 50:19.642
...and Anne Boleyn. To your futures.

50:20.435 --> 50:22.353
His Eminence Cardinal Wolsey.

50:25.398 --> 50:27.567
I want your opinion.

50:30.069 --> 50:31.779
Do you like this cloth?

50:32.030 --> 50:34.323
I think it suits Your Majesty
very well.

50:39.662 --> 50:43.750
Perhaps, if I might suggest...

50:45.835 --> 50:47.587
...with these.

50:50.006 --> 50:52.884
Do you think Francis
will have anything as fine as these?

50:53.092 --> 50:55.553
Only if he steals them.

50:56.304 --> 50:57.805
Come.

50:58.556 --> 51:01.058
Let's eat together. We can talk.

51:10.234 --> 51:11.527
Hold.

51:26.918 --> 51:28.711
Your Grace will apologise.

51:32.089 --> 51:35.384
I said, you will apologise.

51:36.511 --> 51:40.056
I apologise if I have offended,
Your Majesty.

51:41.557 --> 51:43.851
Your Grace may leave us.

51:46.938 --> 51:50.942
Boy, fetch the chancellor
a new pair of shoes.

51:51.442 --> 51:53.277
Hopkins.

51:54.904 --> 51:56.948
Hopkins.

52:13.673 --> 52:14.840
Your Grace.

52:15.758 --> 52:16.759
It's time.

52:19.303 --> 52:20.930
Speak to me.

52:21.138 --> 52:25.434
Yes, well,
everything is prepared for the summit.

52:25.643 --> 52:28.771
It will take place in the Pale of Calais.
English territory.

52:28.980 --> 52:32.775
In a valley known as the Val d'Or.
The valley of gold.

52:33.276 --> 52:36.779
A thousand labourers have constructed
a palace for Your Majesty.

52:36.988 --> 52:38.781
It's known as the palace of illusion.

52:39.824 --> 52:42.994
Some say
it's the eighth wonder of the world.

52:43.953 --> 52:47.873
Purchase cloth of gold and silver. It's
a better thing to bribe the guards with.

52:48.082 --> 52:49.166
Yes, Your Grace.

52:49.375 --> 52:52.128
Then proceed to our estates
and do as we discussed.

52:52.336 --> 52:55.548
Just making noise that we're
only raising men to defend ourselves.

52:55.756 --> 52:56.841
Yes, your Grace.

53:00.177 --> 53:03.639
Lady Blount is with child.

53:11.230 --> 53:12.690
Lady Blount.

53:13.190 --> 53:16.235
If you want to keep the child,
I will arrange for her...

53:16.444 --> 53:19.488
...to be moved to the house in Jericho.

53:20.406 --> 53:22.825
I will also deal with her husband.

53:27.496 --> 53:31.375
My father once told me how he'd
planned to assassinate Richard III.

53:33.794 --> 53:37.631
He would come before him
with a knife secreted about his person.

53:38.924 --> 53:40.926
Your Majesty.

54:16.879 --> 54:19.173
I can't wait for this summit.

54:20.299 --> 54:22.426
It will change the world forever.

54:22.635 --> 54:26.263
That is my dearest hope,
and my ultimate belief.

54:27.848 --> 54:31.685
Nothing will ever be the same,
Your Eminence.

54:32.770 --> 54:35.481
You and I will be immortal.
