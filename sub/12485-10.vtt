WEBVTT

00:05.673 --> 00:09.310
Olive, if you're ever gonna
achieve your dream of winning
the Tour de France,

00:09.343 --> 00:12.813
you really need to learn
how to ride your bike
without training wheels.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.415
I've read
the Tour rule book.

00:14.448 --> 00:14.548
There's nothing
prohibiting it.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.120
Come on,
this is easy.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.321
It's like riding a bike.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.792
Well, if it's so easy,
then why don't you
get on here and do it?

00:24.825 --> 00:26.227
Hey, this isn't
about me.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.397
Forget it.
I'm not doing it.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.500
Not until bikes
have front and side
impact air bags.

00:33.834 --> 00:34.635
Well, you just
need a little push.

00:35.503 --> 00:38.206
Ready? On three.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.273
Three!

00:39.307 --> 00:42.110
Whoa! Whoa!

00:44.178 --> 00:45.146
Look at me!
I'm doing it!

00:45.646 --> 00:47.081
I'm doing it!

00:47.115 --> 00:48.516
(SCREAMS)

00:53.621 --> 00:56.524
Well, there was
no air bag, but luckily,
there was an old bag.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.194
Principal Skidmore,
are you okay?

01:00.228 --> 01:01.429
(GRUNTS)

01:01.462 --> 01:02.630
Please don't need
mouth-to-mouth.

01:02.663 --> 01:03.531
Please don't need
mouth-to-mouth.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.237
I'm fine!

01:09.270 --> 01:10.538
I think I chipped
my teeth.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.310
Now I'm gonna
have to wear
my weekend teeth.

01:24.152 --> 01:26.187
* Ooh, ooh
 Doo, doo

01:26.220 --> 01:26.587
* Ooh, ooh
 Doo, doo

01:28.289 --> 01:29.390
Whoo!

01:29.423 --> 01:31.525
* Everybody's got that thing

01:31.559 --> 01:33.394
* Something different
 we all bring

01:33.427 --> 01:35.363
* Don't you let 'em
 clip your wings

01:35.396 --> 01:37.131
* You got it
 You got it

01:37.165 --> 01:38.899
* We're on fire and we blaze

01:38.932 --> 01:40.401
* In extraordinary ways

01:40.434 --> 01:42.536
* 365 days

01:42.570 --> 01:44.372
* We got it
 We got it

01:44.405 --> 01:46.207
* You can dream it

01:46.240 --> 01:47.508
* You can be it

01:47.541 --> 01:48.576
* If you can feel it

01:48.609 --> 01:49.710
* You can believe it

01:52.213 --> 01:54.915
* 'Cause I am, you are, we are

01:54.948 --> 01:59.520
* Exceptional
 Exceptional

01:59.553 --> 02:03.257
* Yeah, I am, you are, we are

02:03.291 --> 02:06.894
* Exceptional
 Exceptional

02:06.927 --> 02:10.198
* Ooh, ooh, ooh

02:10.231 --> 02:10.564
* Ooh, ooh

02:10.598 --> 02:12.466
Whoo!

02:17.405 --> 02:20.241
I can't believe
you almost killed Skidmore.

02:21.609 --> 02:26.247
Do you think her life
flashed before her eyes?

02:26.280 --> 02:28.516
No. If it had,
we'd still be out there,

02:28.549 --> 02:29.950
barely up to the 1890s.

02:29.983 --> 02:30.017
(LAUGHS)

02:34.222 --> 02:36.257
Olive, why aren't
you laughing?

02:36.290 --> 02:38.392
That joke had
everything you love.

02:38.426 --> 02:39.727
Making fun of Skidmore
and a reference
to the 19th century.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.332
You know those papers
Skidmore dropped?

02:44.365 --> 02:47.335
That was the new
school budget.

02:47.368 --> 02:50.571
Skidmore is planning
to completely cut
the art and music programs.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.474
What? That's crazy!

02:53.507 --> 02:55.776
I mean, cutting art, I get.
But music?

02:58.379 --> 03:01.282
Why can't they just cut
unnecessary things
like math and English?

03:03.384 --> 03:05.519
That would be, like,
a kajillion times more gooder.

03:07.355 --> 03:11.692
Get this. She added
a ton of money
to renovate her office.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.494
Well, it does
need work.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.429
The horizontal stripes
on her couch

03:15.463 --> 03:17.498
totally clash with
the vertical bars
of her holding cell.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.302
(SIGHS) Fletcher,
you're missing the point.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.605
If she cuts
art and music, then

03:24.638 --> 03:27.741
you and I will be
forced to leave
the A.N.T. Program.

03:27.775 --> 03:30.778
But maybe the school
board won't approve
Skidmore's budget.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.646
Of course they will.
They don't even read them.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.782
They just rubber-stamp them
and scarf down free scones.

03:37.485 --> 03:39.019
How do you know that?

03:39.052 --> 03:40.554
Well, I write
a school board blog.

03:40.588 --> 03:40.821
You know,
 Board by Olive.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.794
This is horrible.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.796
I don't want to go
to another school.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.498
I mean, yes, this place
is basically Alcatraz

03:50.531 --> 03:53.834
without the view
and the fresh ocean breeze,

03:56.304 --> 03:57.405
but you guys are here.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.741
You're my best friends.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.611
And I'm not letting
Skidmore get rid of us
without a fight.

04:03.644 --> 04:06.480
Well, I know just
what we have to do.

04:11.319 --> 04:12.753
So, are you
going to tell us

04:12.786 --> 04:14.722
or are you just
gonna stand there
grinning like an idiot?

04:17.458 --> 04:20.428
Uh, actually,
I don't have any ideas

04:20.461 --> 04:22.430
but Chyna always
smiles and nods before
she comes up with a plan,

04:22.463 --> 04:23.631
so I thought
I'd give it a shot.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.738
CAMERON: (ON PA)
 Good morning, Webster Wolves.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.374
This is Cameron Parks.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.708
Time for today's
 announcements.

04:34.742 --> 04:37.745
Principal Skidmore would
 like to inform everyone

04:37.778 --> 04:39.647
that having a bicycle
 in the hallway

04:39.680 --> 04:42.282
will now be punishable
 by life in prison.

04:45.653 --> 04:49.289
Whoa! Whoa!

04:51.725 --> 04:53.427
CAMERON: Chemistry Club
 will now meet...

04:53.461 --> 04:55.429
I got a new outfit!

04:55.463 --> 04:58.366
Now accepting compliments
and catty, jealous remarks.

05:01.369 --> 05:02.470
Excuse me?

05:02.503 --> 05:04.605
Hello?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.374
You're not basking
in my radiance.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.879
Who is everyone
paying attention to
instead of me?

05:11.912 --> 05:14.882
Cameron. He always does
the morning announcements.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.684
You'd know that if you
ever got here on time.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.854
You try applying bronzer,
mascara, blush, eye shadow,

05:20.888 --> 05:25.659
concealer, lip gloss,
lipliner, and lipstick
before 8:00 a.m.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.396
Oh, please.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.398
You think I wake up
looking this good?

05:33.534 --> 05:38.406
And now, let's take
a moment of silence for
our school's librarian.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.107
She's not dead.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.675
She would just, for once,
like a moment of silence.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.380
Hello, fellow students.

05:46.414 --> 05:47.781
Lexi Reed here with
some announcements

05:47.815 --> 05:48.916
you'll actually care about.
(CHUCKLES)

05:50.951 --> 05:54.655
Today I'm wearing a darling
Chantilly lace blouse...

05:54.688 --> 05:55.689
What are you doing?

05:56.724 --> 05:57.891
I'm your new cohost.

05:57.925 --> 05:58.792
But I don't want a cohost.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.828
Neither do I!

06:00.861 --> 06:01.962
See?
We're already agreeing.

06:04.832 --> 06:04.932
Now seriously,
get out of my chair.

06:08.469 --> 06:11.505
Paired with my blouse
is just a fabulous
periwinkle blazer...

06:15.843 --> 06:19.913
Okay, I know we're upset
about this budget thing,
but can we take a break?

06:19.947 --> 06:22.716
When it comes to pacing,
I like to pace myself.

06:24.485 --> 06:27.521
You wanteNo.o see me?

06:27.555 --> 06:29.189
We wanted to talk to you.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.591
No one wants
to see you. Ew!

06:33.226 --> 06:36.964
Principal Skidmore,
we know all about
your dark secret.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.467
You found out about
the disco album
I recorded in 1975?

06:42.470 --> 06:44.905
I thought I owned
every copy of
 Saturday Night Skidmore.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.476
Not that secret.

06:49.910 --> 06:53.514
Olive saw the papers
you dropped this morning.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.483
Then I don't know
what you're talking about.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.585
Oh, and, uh, forget about
the other thing I mentioned.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.721
Don't play dumb!
That's Fletcher's game.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.624
Yeah!

07:03.657 --> 07:05.526
Listen, Olive, if you know
what's good for you,

07:05.559 --> 07:09.597
you'll forget whatever
you think you saw.

07:09.630 --> 07:10.030
Forget? I can't forget!

07:13.734 --> 07:14.868
Do you know
how hard I've been
trying to forget the day

07:14.902 --> 07:16.436
I walked in on
Skidmore doing yoga?

07:19.272 --> 07:20.541
Here, let me show you.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.578
This is the position I was in
when I was throwing up!

07:26.046 --> 07:29.683
Olive, you don't
have to forget anything.

07:29.717 --> 07:32.686
Because you're
going to that
school board meeting

07:32.720 --> 07:33.053
to tell them
exact(DOOR LOCKS)saw.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.028
Oh, no!

07:41.061 --> 07:43.263
Skidmore locked us
in here to keep us from
going to that meeting!

07:43.296 --> 07:43.864
(SCREAMS)

07:43.897 --> 07:45.666
Olive!

07:45.699 --> 07:47.835
It's okay,
we'll find a way out.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.070
No, I just got another image
of Skidmore doing yoga.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.776
She's surprisingly limber.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.719
Hello,
 Webster Wolves.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.655
Lexi Reed here with
 a few more announcements.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.591
Cindy and Jessica
 are both wearing
 the same top today.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.960
Please be sure
to make fun of them.

08:17.565 --> 08:18.666
Now, for today's beauty tip.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.801
Wanna be beautiful?

08:20.834 --> 08:23.503
Try being born pretty.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.907
What are you doing?

08:26.940 --> 08:28.742
Just making some additional
morning announcements.

08:28.776 --> 08:31.912
The reason they're called
morning announcements

08:31.945 --> 08:33.614
is because they happen
in the morning.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.048
Once a day.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.950
It's narrow-minded
thinking like that

08:36.984 --> 08:38.586
that's prevented this show
from being a hit!

08:39.720 --> 08:42.289
It's not a show.
It's announcements.

08:42.322 --> 08:43.791
And they're my thing.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.559
You have lots of things.

08:45.593 --> 08:46.827
Like being pretty

08:46.860 --> 08:48.596
and giving other girls
self-esteem issues.

08:48.629 --> 08:49.730
(SOBBING)

08:52.766 --> 08:56.804
Aw, my show is already
touching lives.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.976
She thinks she can
just lock us in here?

09:03.010 --> 09:05.679
Well, we'll just call
somebody to let us out.

09:06.647 --> 09:07.581
SKIDMORE: Timber!

09:07.615 --> 09:09.549
(LOUD CRASHING)

09:10.117 --> 09:13.654
There goes the cell tower.

09:13.687 --> 09:16.123
Well, maybe we can just
wave over some help
through the window.

09:18.000 --> 09:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:27.901 --> 09:29.036
I'll handle this.

09:29.069 --> 09:32.906
There's no cage
that can hold me.

09:34.107 --> 09:34.975
(EXHALES)

09:40.914 --> 09:41.048
Well, I'm all out of tricks.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.854
What if we pry
that vent off?

09:46.887 --> 09:47.020
We can crawl out
through the ducts.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.733
Skidmore probably
cut corners on
the air-conditioning

09:59.767 --> 10:00.968
to pay for the
Olympic-sized pool
in her office.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.778
Wait!

10:10.811 --> 10:12.813
Maybe we can use
that fire extinguisher

10:12.846 --> 10:13.947
to smash
through the window!

10:20.453 --> 10:21.755
Oh, come on!

10:27.460 --> 10:28.228
What's going on?

10:29.963 --> 10:30.998
I can't see.

10:33.100 --> 10:36.670
Good afternoon,
and welcome to
 Mornings With Lexi,

10:36.704 --> 10:38.438
featuring me, Lexi Reed,

10:38.471 --> 10:41.074
and my band,
Wacky and the Wolf Pack!

10:43.243 --> 10:44.244
(PLAYING FUNKY MUSIC)

10:51.118 --> 10:51.985
(GLASS SHATTERS)

10:53.486 --> 10:55.655
Lexi!

10:56.123 --> 10:57.424
Lexi!

10:59.893 --> 11:03.764
Now would be a good time
to take a break for this
important message.

11:03.797 --> 11:08.836
Lexi Reed here
 to remind you that
 you can make a difference.

11:08.869 --> 11:12.005
Don't stand idly by.
 Speak up.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.974
So, if you see
 a beautiful girl,

11:14.007 --> 11:16.777
tell her how
 beautiful she is.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.747
We know, but it's
 still nice to hear.

11:20.748 --> 11:21.281
Just sayin'.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.222
Ready?

11:29.256 --> 11:32.860
One, two, three!

11:32.893 --> 11:33.026
(SCREAMS)

11:36.029 --> 11:38.165
Did it work?

11:38.198 --> 11:41.001
Well, obviously
it didn't work.
The door is still closed.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.003
We weren't trying
to open the door.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.037
We were just trying
to cure his hiccups.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.205
Told you
it would work.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.808
(Dang it.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.078
Well, we're
stuck in here.

11:52.079 --> 11:55.115
I guess Skidmore wins.

11:55.148 --> 11:58.018
Can't believe
you and I have to leave
the A.N.T. Program.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.887
This is so sad.

11:59.920 --> 12:00.921
What am I going to do
without you guys?

12:00.954 --> 12:02.489
We've always been
the three amigos .

12:02.522 --> 12:06.193
Yeah.
The three amigos.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.264
This must be awkward
for you, Fletcher.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.038
This stinks.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.974
You guys are the only reason
I like going to school.

12:21.008 --> 12:22.275
Me, too.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.077
I mean,
the only two things
I can count on are

12:24.111 --> 12:25.913

hogging the limelight.

it will make the bristles

Why did you lock us
in the Ant Farm to keep me
from telling what I saw?

Because amongst
those papers

16:48.408 --> 16:51.078
was a copy
of my birth certificate.
