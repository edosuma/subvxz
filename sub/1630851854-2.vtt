00:05.005 --> 00:07.842
WHILE THIS STORY IS BASED
ON ACTUAL EVENTS,

00:07.925 --> 00:11.095
CERTAIN CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS,
AND DIALOGUE WERE FICTIONALIZED.

00:11.178 --> 00:14.974
ANY SIMILARITY TO ANY PERSON,
LIVING OR DEAD, IS FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES.

00:17.268 --> 00:19.603
<i>The military is as old as the universe.</i>

00:20.271 --> 00:21.856
<i>It is found in the Bible,</i>

00:22.148 --> 00:26.193
<i>which speaks of heavenly militias</i>
<i>summoned to fight evil.</i>

00:26.485 --> 00:29.530
<i>Saint Michael the Archangel,</i>
<i>the Virgin of Mercy,</i>

00:29.613 --> 00:33.993
<i>are mystical symbols of the military</i>
<i>in their purest form.</i>

00:34.910 --> 00:37.163
<i>When we embrace the military career,</i>

00:37.246 --> 00:40.458
<i>we don't just embrace a profession,</i>

00:40.541 --> 00:42.835
<i>we permanently become…</i>

00:42.918 --> 00:43.919
One?

00:44.336 --> 00:49.341
<i>…which imprints a personality</i>
<i>that'll be embedded for life.</i>

00:50.801 --> 00:52.470
<i>Carlos Pellegrini said,</i>

00:52.553 --> 00:56.599
<i>"The military man is armed.</i>
<i>He has the privilege of being armed..."</i>

00:56.724 --> 00:58.225
I'll go with you today.

00:58.309 --> 01:01.437
I already told you "no," it's dangerous.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.147
I'll go with you.

01:04.982 --> 01:08.944
It's us women who have to go,
because they think we're harmless.

01:09.028 --> 01:10.404
They underestimate us.

02:48.377 --> 02:50.379
MARADONA:
BLESSED DREAM

02:50.754 --> 02:52.339
DICTATED

03:01.974 --> 03:04.018
- It runs beautifully.
- Yes.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.854
- It smells so good.
- Yes.

03:07.438 --> 03:08.814
Take a bow.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.485
Take a bow.

03:18.782 --> 03:21.201
You're such a pain in the ass!

03:22.161 --> 03:25.205
Bloody hell, Pelusa!

03:28.417 --> 03:29.919
Mrs. Tota!

03:32.922 --> 03:34.423
So, what do you say?

03:36.592 --> 03:39.678
It's beautiful, son! A brand-new car!

03:39.762 --> 03:42.389
Well, it's almost brand-new, but...

03:42.681 --> 03:45.142
Tell the rest that we're going for a ride.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.101
Honey!

03:46.185 --> 03:47.645
- What?
- Come on, guys!

03:48.145 --> 03:49.438
Wow!

03:49.563 --> 03:51.273
- Come on.
- Look at that.

03:51.357 --> 03:53.734
Look at that.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.903
So? What do you say, shall we?

03:56.195 --> 03:57.947
Careful with the upholstery.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.366
- Don't break anything.
- I'll close it.

04:00.449 --> 04:03.661
What's wrong with the butcher
that's looking at us like that?

04:03.744 --> 04:07.373
- Do we owe him money?
- No, he says that we're dirty peasants,

04:07.456 --> 04:09.500
that the neighborhood is too good for us.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.087
Is that so?

04:14.004 --> 04:16.256
Well, is everyone ready?

04:16.340 --> 04:18.467
- Go on.
- Let's go!

04:18.968 --> 04:20.636
The plane's leaving.

04:29.728 --> 04:33.399
Watch out, you'll have to go home!

04:34.566 --> 04:37.236
Excuse me, the dirty peasants don't know
how to drive!

04:41.323 --> 04:42.616
NEWS BULLETIN

04:57.798 --> 05:01.176
<i>He has extremely high blood pressure</i>
<i>and a ventricular arrhythmia...</i>

05:01.301 --> 05:04.555
<i>…Diego Maradona started</i>
<i>the new millennium with excess…</i>

06:31.100 --> 06:33.977
- Take my things to the car, please.
- Yes.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.037
The first thing I want to ask you is

06:53.080 --> 06:54.748
not to make up any ridiculous story.

06:54.832 --> 06:59.086
In an effort to get
a front page or a scoop,

06:59.503 --> 07:04.424
you release fake news
that puts the whole family on edge.

07:05.092 --> 07:10.305
The only truth is
that Diego is being monitored.

07:10.389 --> 07:12.474
He's in a special care unit

07:13.350 --> 07:14.810
and he's recovering.

07:14.893 --> 07:18.605
There are rumors
that Diego arrived in a coma,

07:18.689 --> 07:20.232
the result of a cocaine overdose.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.067
Where did you get that nonsense?

07:22.234 --> 07:25.445
Diego spent a quiet New Year's Eve,

07:25.946 --> 07:27.948
surrounded by his close friends,

07:28.031 --> 07:32.244
in peace, in harmony,
more relaxed than ever.

07:37.666 --> 07:42.045
<i>Of course there was also room</i>
<i>for some fun,</i>

07:42.129 --> 07:45.424
<i>but always surrounded by good friends,</i>

07:45.507 --> 07:48.302
<i>people who want what's best for Diego.</i>

07:48.468 --> 07:49.928
<i>He enjoyed his family.</i>

07:51.013 --> 07:53.557
<i>The girls and Claudia</i>
<i>who, as you all know,</i>

07:53.640 --> 07:56.518
<i>are his refuge, his safe haven.</i>

07:56.602 --> 08:01.106
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>he probably ate a little bit too much.</i>

08:01.190 --> 08:04.318
<i>-He overdid the food but, please...</i>
<i>-Come on, bitches!</i>

08:04.401 --> 08:08.322
<i>Who doesn't eat or drink</i>
<i>a little bit too much during the holidays?</i>

08:18.498 --> 08:23.545
Diego woke up a little uneasy.

08:23.629 --> 08:25.088
He was out of breath

08:25.547 --> 08:28.217
so he asked me to bring him here

08:28.300 --> 08:32.638
to have a check-up, that's it.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.848
Hey, Guillote, go easy on the coke!

08:34.932 --> 08:38.810
- There are assholes everywhere.
- Share, don't take it all yourself!

08:38.894 --> 08:41.480
But this happens
because of the nonsense you publish,

08:41.563 --> 08:44.233
and you make idiots like that believe

08:44.524 --> 08:48.820
that Diego is surrounded
by dealers, prostitutes, a crazy life.

08:48.904 --> 08:52.282
Is it true that Diego's breakdown was
due to a FIFA ranking

08:52.366 --> 08:55.118
that places him
as the fifth-best player in the world?

08:56.203 --> 08:59.164
I don't answer bullshit like that.
Excuse me.

08:59.248 --> 09:04.086
There are so many reporters here
that I can assure you if anything happens,

09:04.294 --> 09:06.672
you'll find out before I do. Bye.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.759
What's your problem with me, Tota?

09:11.176 --> 09:12.719
Why did you tell me that?

09:14.429 --> 09:17.391
Do you really think
I didn't take care of your son?

09:17.975 --> 09:20.269
Diego's had this problem
for over 15 years,

09:20.352 --> 09:23.146
and I've been taking care of him, alone.

09:23.313 --> 09:26.191
Why didn't you speak up at the time
when this started

09:26.441 --> 09:27.901
instead of covering it up?

09:27.985 --> 09:29.695
But I never covered it up.

09:30.028 --> 09:33.490
But you didn't call his family,
you left us out of it.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.117
What could you have done?

09:35.534 --> 09:37.077
Diego doesn't listen to anyone.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.080
He listens to me, Claudia.

09:42.291 --> 09:45.294
When someone wants to use,
they don't ask their mother's permission.

09:45.627 --> 09:49.464
Diego took drugs for a long time,
as you say. It's true.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.466
But he never took it this far.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.678
That's because you left him alone.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.555
Because you wanted to break up.

09:56.847 --> 09:58.015
He didn't.

09:58.682 --> 10:02.561
You forgot that you made
a promise for life, you forgot!

10:02.811 --> 10:04.938
And now you want to leave him alone?

10:07.816 --> 10:10.319
If my son dies, I'll never forgive you.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.574
And if he doesn't, I still won't.

10:30.589 --> 10:32.674
Come on, let's win today.

10:32.758 --> 10:34.885
Our people have packed the stadium.

10:34.968 --> 10:38.055
Everyone, pass the ball
to Diego, okay? Let's go!

10:41.350 --> 10:43.477
Let's go!

10:46.521 --> 10:48.148
Dear God, help me, please.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.571
Goyo, what's wrong?

10:54.654 --> 10:56.823
He got tackled pretty hard.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.369
Come on, buddy, be strong.

11:05.499 --> 11:08.043
Listen, do you think it's serious?

11:08.418 --> 11:10.545
I think it's a torn ligament.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.840
Call him tomorrow to see what he needs.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.385
He should get treatment with Quintana.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.387
Goyo can't afford Quintana.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.850
Tell him I'll cover the expenses.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.270
Poor Goyo, such bad luck.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.607
<i>Diego comes in,</i>
<i>surrounded by four Vélez players,</i>

11:30.690 --> 11:32.067
<i>the left-footer's coming.</i>

11:32.150 --> 11:35.695
<i>There goes Wonder Boy.</i>
<i>He goes to the middle of the field.</i>

11:35.779 --> 11:37.656
<i>Three players behind him.</i>

11:37.739 --> 11:40.534
<i>He'll shoot with the left foot,</i>
<i>the way he likes it.</i>

11:40.617 --> 11:42.619
<i>Shoot it, Diego. It'll be a great goal!</i>

11:42.702 --> 11:45.747
<i>Diego continues with his left foot,</i>
<i>he'll cross it.</i>

11:45.831 --> 11:48.500
<i>Unbelievable. I can't believe it.</i>

11:48.583 --> 11:51.962
<i>Argentinos Juniors missed</i>
<i>the magic left foot of Diego Maradona.</i>

11:53.964 --> 11:55.632
I go past the first defender.

11:55.799 --> 11:59.428
Then I go past the second one.
When I leave the goalkeeper on his knees,

11:59.511 --> 12:01.555
I hit the first post. That's the move.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.598
Why didn't you do it with your hand?

12:04.099 --> 12:05.725
You played a good match.

12:05.809 --> 12:08.061
You'll see it in the papers tomorrow.

12:08.145 --> 12:11.857
I don't care about that, fathead!
We could have won it.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.445
I need to be stronger
for this kind of play.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.697
I have to train harder.

12:26.872 --> 12:28.039
That's a great goal.

12:28.123 --> 12:29.499
- That?
- Yes.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.960
- Are you serious?
- Yes, what do you want?

12:32.043 --> 12:33.753
Cyterszpiller has it.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.964
Cyterszpiller dribbles past the defender.

12:36.047 --> 12:38.383
- Past the second one.
- You can't run.

12:38.467 --> 12:41.595
- Maradona comes out, he shoots!
- Come on, I'm getting wet!

12:41.678 --> 12:43.638
He did it, it's incredible!

12:45.640 --> 12:48.977
Come on, Pelusa. Hit it!

12:49.978 --> 12:52.355
One more.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.196
With your left hand!

13:01.323 --> 13:04.993
One, two, three, four, five,

13:05.160 --> 13:07.496
six, seven.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.751
Get out!

13:31.686 --> 13:35.232
Eighteen, nineteen!

13:38.026 --> 13:41.696
<i>Bicho's looking for a draw,</i>
<i>Rosario Central is winning 2-1.</i>

13:41.780 --> 13:43.114
<i>It's all up to him.</i>

13:43.198 --> 13:46.201
<i>The wicked left-footer goes into the area,</i>
<i>he perseveres.</i>

13:46.284 --> 13:47.452
<i>It's now or never, Diego!</i>

13:47.619 --> 13:51.623
<i>Diego, goal!</i>

13:51.748 --> 13:55.585
<i>A goal for Argentinos Junior!</i>

13:55.669 --> 13:57.295
<i>The one and only, Diego Maradona.</i>

13:57.379 --> 13:59.506
See? I told you that was the move!

13:59.589 --> 14:02.217
Goal!

14:03.134 --> 14:06.721
"Diego Maradona,
16 years old, first division player."

14:10.141 --> 14:11.351
Morning, Don Atilio.

14:11.434 --> 14:14.396
- Diego, you're awesome!
- How's it going?

14:14.479 --> 14:17.274
- What a crazy goal you scored!
- Did you like it?

14:17.357 --> 14:20.860
I went to see you.
I have my voice like this because of you.

14:22.737 --> 14:23.905
Hi, Claudia.

14:24.155 --> 14:26.032
- Hi, Diego.
- How are you doing?

14:26.866 --> 14:29.494
I'm fine, and you?

14:30.078 --> 14:31.621
Very well.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.500
You like fishing?

14:36.084 --> 14:39.212
Yes, actually my dad really likes it.

14:39.337 --> 14:43.174
- He loves fishing.
- Look at that.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.017
So does my dad.

14:53.602 --> 14:56.563
Yes, he loves fishing.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.065
Yeah.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.281
He's from
a little town in Corrientes,

15:07.157 --> 15:09.409
and as soon as you are born, you know…

15:10.827 --> 15:12.746
they teach you how to fish.

15:13.997 --> 15:16.249
- How about that. Nice.
- Yes.

15:19.961 --> 15:24.299
- Are you going to the club party?
- If my dad lets me, I will.

15:31.681 --> 15:32.974
Excuse me.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.395
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- No.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.482
I don't have a boyfriend, no.

15:43.193 --> 15:44.527
Do you want one?

15:50.617 --> 15:53.286
I have to go, I'm running late.

15:53.370 --> 15:54.871
Can you give this to him?

15:54.954 --> 15:57.332
You're leaving? Yes, I have to go.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.250
See you later.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.906
Careful, man!

16:30.198 --> 16:31.950
Why did you let him come?

16:32.033 --> 16:33.159
What if he gets hurt?

16:33.243 --> 16:35.537
I told him, but he wouldn't listen.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.980
What the fuck are you doing?

17:02.272 --> 17:04.149
Easy, boys!

17:05.358 --> 17:07.819
Calm down! It's just a soccer game.

17:07.902 --> 17:09.863
- It's a game.
- You asshole!

17:09.946 --> 17:13.199
What's wrong with you?
What the hell are you doing here?

17:13.283 --> 17:15.910
This isn't for you anymore,
you're a pro now.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.330
What if your career is over
because of a shitty game?

17:19.539 --> 17:20.749
"Shitty game"?

17:21.207 --> 17:24.753
Against the Sarandi assholes?
Fiorito's always been their rivals.

17:25.003 --> 17:27.672
What do you mean?
You don't live here anymore.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.176
You never leave Fiorito for good!

17:33.970 --> 17:36.389
And there is
a truckload of money riding on this.

17:36.473 --> 17:37.849
The loser pays the barbecue.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.445
You laugh now.

17:50.528 --> 17:55.533
You said that Pelusa didn't listen to you,
but you were the one who bet the most.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.410
And I doubled my money.

17:58.870 --> 18:01.080
Okay, so?

18:01.915 --> 18:05.251
Did you came all the way to Fiorito
just to tell us off?

18:05.335 --> 18:09.839
I came all this way to let you know
you've been called up to the youth team.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.884
They want you to start on Monday.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.555
I have to confirm your attendance.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.891
I don't know if you're free on Monday.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.560
Maybe you have
to come here for a rematch.

18:28.149 --> 18:31.277
- Sorry, I know you're right.
- Congratulations, Pelusa!

18:49.629 --> 18:51.005
What's up, Pelusa?

18:52.173 --> 18:53.424
What's up, Goyo?

18:54.551 --> 18:57.554
You're leaving.
Won't you stay for the barbecue?

18:58.513 --> 19:01.808
- I have to get going.
- But I already invited all the boys.

19:01.891 --> 19:04.978
And they must be nearly here.
Everyone's coming.

19:05.061 --> 19:08.481
Coto, Gaita, Carucha,
Cuervo, do you remember?

19:08.565 --> 19:11.693
Yes, of course. Maybe another day, okay?

19:12.318 --> 19:14.070
I have so many things to do.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.282
Say hello to them for me.

19:18.366 --> 19:19.784
See you, Goyito.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.914
Fame really goes
to some people's heads, huh?

19:30.712 --> 19:32.255
Are you serious, Goyito?

19:33.590 --> 19:36.718
Do you think that, if that was true,
I would've come here today?

19:36.801 --> 19:38.928
You don't care about your friends.

19:39.470 --> 19:42.473
I fucked up my leg
and you didn't even call.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.518
- I told Jorge to do it.
- Why waste your time, right?

19:45.602 --> 19:48.271
Sorry. It's not all about money, Pelusita.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.148
He's drunk, let it go.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.526
I got you the best physical therapist
in the country.

19:53.902 --> 19:55.111
Wasn't it good enough?

19:55.194 --> 19:57.947
I went a couple of times
and got fed up with it.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.783
- Do you know how hard it is to go?
- I do.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.827
- You can't imagine.
- Yes, I can!

20:03.244 --> 20:05.246
But if you don't go, you'll never heal.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.665
It's so easy for you now, isn't it?

20:07.749 --> 20:09.834
You earn money, a lot of money.

20:10.126 --> 20:12.629
The club gave you a house two blocks away.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.797
You're talking crap, Goyo.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.634
We'll talk some other time
when you're not drunk.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.594
You never leave Fiorito, you know?

20:19.761 --> 20:21.220
Enough!

20:24.182 --> 20:26.726
If it wasn't for me, you would be nothing!

20:37.487 --> 20:40.281
And he told me
I had to be a good teammate,

20:40.365 --> 20:43.618
- train hard, and he welcomed me.
- That's great, my friend!

20:43.868 --> 20:46.704
Bottle man!

20:46.788 --> 20:48.665
Did you ask if they'll still try?

20:48.748 --> 20:52.752
No, the last chance was yesterday.
They won't be signing this year.

20:53.211 --> 20:57.048
My folks wouldn't let me go anyway.
They say Cebollitas is too far away.

20:58.508 --> 20:59.884
Thanks, Fatiga!

21:00.093 --> 21:01.678
- Bye, boys!
- Thank you.

21:02.971 --> 21:06.975
Count me in the next round, guys.
Ready, aim, fire!

21:07.767 --> 21:09.435
Pelusa, want to play?

21:09.519 --> 21:12.271
- I haven't had any water all afternoon.
- I won!

21:15.692 --> 21:19.821
Here, Pelusa, take this.
I don't want to piss on it.

21:19.904 --> 21:22.907
The coach sent it for you
so that you can try out tomorrow.

21:22.991 --> 21:24.951
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

21:34.043 --> 21:36.254
Mom, I've got money!

21:42.760 --> 21:44.762
After today's training,

21:44.846 --> 21:47.432
you'll be playing soccer
with the national team.

21:47.515 --> 21:51.644
The practice will be directed by Menotti,
so take advantage of that.

21:51.728 --> 21:55.565
Few players have the opportunity
to prove themselves

21:55.773 --> 21:57.942
before the coach of the national team.

21:58.026 --> 22:00.403
Go easy to the ball.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.572
If someone gets hurt, it's a problem.

22:03.656 --> 22:07.243
A team is an idea, and I want my players

22:07.660 --> 22:09.829
to interpret that idea.

22:10.121 --> 22:13.249
To support that idea we'll choose a style

22:13.666 --> 22:19.422
and, as we are the protagonists,
we must commit to this show.

22:19.589 --> 22:22.008
That's what I want from my teams

22:22.091 --> 22:24.635
and that's what I want for the World Cup.

22:26.804 --> 22:28.639
Any more questions, guys?

22:28.765 --> 22:30.433
One touch, always one touch.

22:35.063 --> 22:37.065
Hi, Diego. Nice to meet you.

22:38.441 --> 22:40.985
- The pleasure is mine, sir.
- Come.

22:41.235 --> 22:42.945
I saw you against Talleres.

22:43.488 --> 22:47.241
Actually, I went to see Hacha Ludeña,
but you came on.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.828
What a disrespectful nutmeg
you pulled on Cabrera.

22:51.496 --> 22:54.499
Yeah. My coach told me

22:54.999 --> 22:57.668
to do it to get my nerves out of the way.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.462
Very good advice.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.548
Never forget what you learned
in the street, Diego.

23:02.799 --> 23:06.010
Because that's what sets you apart,
the sandlot.

23:07.887 --> 23:08.763
Yes, sir.

23:16.646 --> 23:19.148
There, come back.

23:19.649 --> 23:23.778
That's it, behind the ball line. Come on.

23:24.278 --> 23:25.655
Well done, Mario.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.286
Well done, Mario.

23:32.829 --> 23:34.956
So well-defined, good.

23:35.790 --> 23:37.333
We're coming out.

23:41.796 --> 23:44.841
Goal!

23:45.383 --> 23:48.469
That's good, Diego.

23:57.103 --> 24:00.648
Release it faster, Maradona,
or they'll kill you.

24:00.731 --> 24:02.150
Go easy on the kid.

24:02.525 --> 24:03.985
Daniel, it's a practice.

24:04.068 --> 24:06.279
Then he shouldn't get cocky
with his dribble.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.660
How did that feel, Diego?

24:13.327 --> 24:14.662
Very good, sir.

24:14.787 --> 24:19.500
For me it's a dream
to share the pitch with these stars.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.169
Get used to it.

24:21.294 --> 24:24.213
If you keep this up,
you'll play for the national team.

24:25.673 --> 24:28.176
They came on strong
a couple of times, didn't they?

24:28.301 --> 24:29.552
Yeah, just a little.

24:30.011 --> 24:33.055
- Are you hurt?
- No. I'll find out tomorrow.

25:06.923 --> 25:09.091
If we get a little organized,

25:09.175 --> 25:12.929
we'll both pick up girls and blow out
the shock absorbers on the Fiat.

25:50.299 --> 25:52.677
I just came across a moron

25:52.760 --> 25:54.470
- who was making fun of you.
- Of me?

25:54.553 --> 25:57.848
Yes, he came out of the bathroom
and I wanted to kill him.

25:57.932 --> 25:59.475
I didn't want trouble, but…

26:00.309 --> 26:01.602
- Who?
- It makes me mad.

26:01.686 --> 26:04.480
It makes me crazy.
He was laughing at your limp.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.524
That one with the mustache.

26:06.983 --> 26:09.986
- There he is, look.
- No, don't worry. I'll take care of it.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.112
Excuse me.

26:14.156 --> 26:16.200
Excuse me, ladies.

26:16.701 --> 26:20.037
Are you playing dumb?
You make fun of me 'cause I'm a cripple?

26:20.204 --> 26:23.958
Maestro, can you play some romantic music?

26:24.250 --> 26:25.835
I'm far better than you.

26:25.918 --> 26:29.171
I could kick the shit out of all of you.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.590
So, get the hell out of here. Get out.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.479
May I have this dance, miss?

26:47.773 --> 26:52.445
Don't tell me you did all that
just to dance with me.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.614
Didn't you?

28:43.514 --> 28:45.182
Can you hear me?

28:48.561 --> 28:50.563
Actually, the question should be…

28:53.190 --> 28:55.609
how long has it been
since you could hear me?

28:57.945 --> 28:59.613
Since you could see me?

29:02.241 --> 29:03.576
You know what?

29:05.870 --> 29:08.289
Even when you left with another woman I…

29:09.165 --> 29:10.541
I hated you,

29:12.751 --> 29:14.170
but I loved you.

29:17.214 --> 29:21.802
What does it matter if you cheated once
or a thousand times?

29:24.680 --> 29:26.182
You gave me so much love.

29:30.311 --> 29:34.064
Do you remember
when you got injured in Barcelona…

29:35.900 --> 29:38.110
and they left us lying there

29:39.612 --> 29:42.323
and I told you, "The game is not over"?

29:44.366 --> 29:48.913
Well, the game isn't over now either,

29:49.872 --> 29:52.791
so wake up
because you'll get out of here alive.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.587
Come on, Diego, wake up!

29:58.589 --> 30:00.382
Wake up, please!

30:02.092 --> 30:04.011
Wake up, please!

30:16.148 --> 30:18.108
Wake up!

30:29.662 --> 30:34.667
Hey! Come on, get up!

30:37.336 --> 30:39.338
Come on, it's already six o'clock.

30:40.339 --> 30:43.634
Six in the morning? Did something happen?

30:44.218 --> 30:45.678
Go get me a newspaper.

30:47.263 --> 30:48.347
Huh?

30:51.058 --> 30:52.184
Maradona?

30:54.687 --> 30:57.398
Can you get me
a jersey signed by the team?

30:58.315 --> 31:01.569
I can't promise you that.
I don't have a lot of sway.

31:01.652 --> 31:04.154
- It's for my boy, do me a favor.
- Diego!

31:04.321 --> 31:06.490
- I'll try.
- Come here, please.

31:07.825 --> 31:10.035
Why are you up so early?

31:10.452 --> 31:11.954
Are you nervous about the game?

31:13.080 --> 31:17.918
No. It's a joke.
Carrasco sent you to get the paper.

31:18.586 --> 31:21.547
Now he'll ask you to get
hot water for the mate.

31:22.673 --> 31:25.259
I suppose I'm paying my dues.

31:25.843 --> 31:28.637
He's the captain, you are the new guy.

31:29.388 --> 31:30.764
Come, sit down.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.601
If everything goes well,

31:33.684 --> 31:35.894
I'll have you play for a few minutes.

31:36.270 --> 31:40.065
It's a good opportunity for your debut,
locally and with a full stadium.

32:28.864 --> 32:31.867
Chino, move. You'll go in!

32:31.950 --> 32:36.080
<i>Stadium announcement,</i>
<i>change in Argentina's team.</i>

32:36.455 --> 32:39.375
<i>Number 11, Julio Ricardo Villa, is out</i>

32:39.458 --> 32:43.754
<i>and number 15,</i>
<i>Jorge "El Chino" Benítez, takes his place.</i>

32:48.801 --> 32:52.304
Maradona, get moving, you'll go in.

33:06.151 --> 33:07.986
Come on, Diego.

33:09.363 --> 33:12.282
You'll replace Luque, play it cool.

33:12.491 --> 33:17.246
<i>Change for Argentina. Number nine,</i>
<i>Leopoldo Jacinto Luque, comes off,</i>

33:17.329 --> 33:21.583
<i>and number 19,</i>
<i>Diego Armando Maradona, takes his place.</i>

33:26.964 --> 33:30.509
<i>Diego Armando Maradona,</i>
<i>only 16 years and 4 months old.</i>

33:30.592 --> 33:35.556
<i>When most boys his age are</i>
<i>in the lower divisions,</i>

33:35.764 --> 33:38.809
<i>Diego makes his debut</i>
<i>in the Argentine National Team.</i>

33:39.017 --> 33:41.437
<i>Tolo Gallego sees Diego,</i>
<i>asking Diego for it.</i>

33:41.520 --> 33:45.816
<i>Diego crosses the halfway line.</i>
<i>He sees Houseman, pass to El Loco.</i>

33:45.899 --> 33:48.026
<i>Could be a goal! Houseman missed it.</i>

33:48.110 --> 33:51.780
<i>It'd have meant</i>
<i>the victory against Hungary.</i>

33:51.864 --> 33:54.950
<i>Good pass from Maradona.</i>
<i>You can tell this kid is different.</i>

33:55.075 --> 33:56.910
<i>Argentina wins, thrashing Hungary.</i>

33:56.994 --> 34:00.664
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>I'm not even thinking about the World Cup.</i>

34:00.998 --> 34:05.294
<i>There's still a year to go and I think...</i>

34:07.921 --> 34:10.841
…there are players
with much more experience than me.

34:10.924 --> 34:13.552
I want to go slowly

34:13.844 --> 34:17.473
and enjoy this dream
of having played a little bit today.

34:17.639 --> 34:20.559
<i>Anyone special you want</i>
<i>to dedicate this debut to?</i>

34:21.518 --> 34:25.481
<i>Yes, her name is Claudia.</i>

34:25.773 --> 34:26.940
<i>Claudia Roxana.</i>

34:30.861 --> 34:32.863
Claudia Roxana?

34:34.406 --> 34:36.116
I'm going to kill you!

34:36.492 --> 34:40.329
- I didn't know you don't like it.
- Anyway, you know what?

34:41.747 --> 34:46.627
I loved that you said
that you have a girlfriend.

34:49.046 --> 34:51.548
Thank you for dedicating your debut to me.

34:54.802 --> 34:56.261
You're very sweet.

34:58.764 --> 35:02.768
Yes, but I don't know
if I did the right thing.

35:06.063 --> 35:08.315
If my old lady heard that interview,

35:08.607 --> 35:11.443
she'd kill me,
because I didn't dedicate it to her.

35:11.652 --> 35:12.945
I didn't even mention her.

35:13.821 --> 35:16.782
Don't be silly. Why should she get angry?

35:16.865 --> 35:18.617
Obviously, you don't know her.

35:19.243 --> 35:22.788
I should buy her some flowers, a gift,

35:23.539 --> 35:25.624
something so she doesn't get upset.

35:26.500 --> 35:29.002
Are you serious?

35:30.504 --> 35:32.422
She gets jealous, Claudia.

35:34.216 --> 35:35.884
I'm her favorite boy.

35:37.636 --> 35:43.600
Well, now you're my favorite boy.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.602
And the only one, I hope.

36:58.425 --> 37:00.719
Get out, Dalmi!

37:01.094 --> 37:04.723
Slow down, you're going to hurt her!

37:10.395 --> 37:12.272
<i>Enough!</i>

37:15.275 --> 37:18.528
<i>-Another one!</i>
<i>-Me? Mine?</i>

37:20.781 --> 37:23.075
<i>Here, the only truth is</i>

37:23.408 --> 37:25.869
<i>that Diego is being monitored.</i>

37:25.953 --> 37:28.622
<i>He's in a special care unit.</i>

37:28.789 --> 37:32.000
<i>Reportedly, Maradona arrived</i>
<i>at the clinic lucid</i>

37:32.084 --> 37:34.670
<i>and in his four-by-four</i>
<i>because he was feeling sick.</i>

37:35.671 --> 37:39.049
Hi. Excuse me.

37:39.132 --> 37:40.384
<i>If all goes well, Diego…</i>

37:40.467 --> 37:42.427
Hello, and who are you?

37:42.511 --> 37:45.055
I'm the doctor who treated Maradona.

37:45.138 --> 37:48.308
I had to take my car
and my blood pressure monitor.

37:48.392 --> 37:50.852
- Can I look for it?
- Come in, go ahead.

37:50.978 --> 37:52.354
<i>For prevention, let's say.</i>

37:52.437 --> 37:54.356
<i>Did you know that anti-narcotics is here?</i>

37:54.439 --> 37:56.483
<i>Yes, I was informed that they were there.</i>

37:56.650 --> 37:59.152
<i>I've seen them come and go, but so far…</i>

37:59.236 --> 38:02.864
<i>Guillermo Coppola was in charge</i>
<i>of denying some reports…</i>

38:02.990 --> 38:04.408
Who are you?

38:04.992 --> 38:08.704
My name is Marcos, I came to get my car

38:08.954 --> 38:11.331
- and this.
- Are you a doctor?

38:13.500 --> 38:15.919
- Yes.
- Do you know anything about my dad?

38:16.712 --> 38:20.048
- No.
- You don't want to tell me either.

38:23.010 --> 38:24.344
Never mind.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.889
<i>…police were involved due</i>
<i>to an alleged overdose.</i>

38:28.098 --> 38:30.225
<i>We'd like to confirm or rectify…</i>

38:31.685 --> 38:33.937
Why don't you turn it off?

38:34.646 --> 38:37.524
It's not true everything they say, okay?

38:37.691 --> 38:39.901
Sometimes, they exaggerate.

38:40.110 --> 38:41.695
I know that they exaggerate.

38:41.862 --> 38:43.780
I'm Diego Maradona's daughter.

38:45.907 --> 38:49.494
Hey, buddy, what are you doing?

38:50.412 --> 38:52.873
<i>Diego Armando Maradona had</i>

38:53.123 --> 38:57.627
<i>severe hypertension</i>
<i>and a ventricular arrhythmia,</i>

38:57.753 --> 39:00.839
<i>in a patient who already had</i>
<i>chronic arterial hypertension.</i>

39:01.131 --> 39:02.424
MARADONA FIGHTS FOR HIS LIFE

39:02.507 --> 39:05.177
<i>He was admitted to the ICU.</i>

39:05.343 --> 39:07.471
<i>He underwent several tests…</i>

39:08.847 --> 39:11.308
EVERY BALL HE TOUCHES IS A GOAL

39:14.811 --> 39:16.688
WILL DIEGO BE MENOTTI'S NUMBER 10?

39:45.467 --> 39:47.052
Take it easy, Diego.

39:49.054 --> 39:51.431
- How was training?
- It sucked.

39:51.556 --> 39:53.391
What is going on with Alonso?

39:53.600 --> 39:56.561
They call him up a month
before the World Cup selection.

39:57.104 --> 39:58.855
Alonso played fewer games than I did.

39:58.939 --> 40:01.775
The guy's getting pressure from all sides.

40:02.025 --> 40:04.194
He must've done it
so they don't bust his balls.

40:04.277 --> 40:05.487
He's pushed by the press,

40:05.570 --> 40:08.323
by the clubs,
by the opinion of the military.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.991
Everybody is on his case.

40:10.450 --> 40:12.828
Menotti likes him.

40:27.801 --> 40:30.137
Look how he hugs him.

40:31.263 --> 40:33.181
He only hugs his favorites like that.

40:33.306 --> 40:35.142
Passarella, Kempes…

40:35.559 --> 40:38.311
He hugged me once, and never again.

40:40.689 --> 40:44.818
Do you really think that this deadbeat,
Alonso, can steal your place?

40:44.901 --> 40:46.194
He's no deadbeat.

40:46.528 --> 40:48.446
He played for a big club, I haven't.

40:49.030 --> 40:54.161
There's no way that Menotti won't take you
to the World Cup, at least for the bench.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.957
Did you make my reservation?

41:01.042 --> 41:03.545
Nine o'clock, two people.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.549
- The table I asked for?
- The table you asked for.

41:07.632 --> 41:09.843
- The white rose?
- What do you take me for?

41:10.594 --> 41:12.596
- Well done!
- Tell me who your date is.

41:12.929 --> 41:14.181
I know it's not Claudia,

41:14.347 --> 41:17.350
because she can't go out at night
during the week.

41:17.517 --> 41:20.645
Otherwise, you wouldn't be so secretive.
Who is it?

41:20.729 --> 41:24.274
You know I'm a gentleman.

41:24.649 --> 41:27.861
You, a gentleman, Pelusa?
Stop fucking around!

41:27.944 --> 41:31.031
Tell me who the girl is, motherfucker!

41:32.240 --> 41:33.950
Hi, I have a reservation.

41:40.332 --> 41:42.417
- Good evening, is she here?
- Good evening.

41:42.500 --> 41:46.546
- She's waiting for you over there.
- Excuse me.

42:16.451 --> 42:17.869
You look lovely.

42:18.662 --> 42:22.499
I'm sorry I'm late.
I couldn't leave practice sooner

42:22.832 --> 42:24.751
and couldn't pick you up.

42:25.460 --> 42:29.589
- Did you get here okay?
- Perfectly. I like traveling by cab.

42:30.215 --> 42:33.260
If Dad hadn't beaten me to the punch,

42:33.343 --> 42:35.095
I'd have married you myself.

42:38.682 --> 42:43.103
Son, if every time you forget
to mention me in an interview

42:43.186 --> 42:46.439
you bring me here,
you'd better not mention me anymore.

42:48.733 --> 42:49.651
Shall we start?

42:58.576 --> 43:02.205
Do they have bread pudding on the menu?
Not as good as yours.

43:13.633 --> 43:17.554
<i>First, I want to tell you</i>
<i>that this is a very difficult day for me.</i>

43:19.055 --> 43:22.350
I know that some of you will have
your hopes shattered.

43:24.853 --> 43:28.064
The truth is that you all worked hard
to be at the World Cup.

43:30.025 --> 43:33.069
I won't explain myself
to the ones who aren't on the list.

43:33.194 --> 43:34.321
I have my reasons,

43:34.404 --> 43:39.409
but there's nothing I can say
that will make you feel better.

43:40.577 --> 43:42.412
But I want you to know

43:43.413 --> 43:46.958
that this is not the end of the world.
Nobody has died here.

43:48.418 --> 43:52.422
Soccer will always give you
a second chance. Always.

43:58.428 --> 43:59.387
Goalkeepers.

44:00.388 --> 44:04.559
Valey, Filliol, and Lavolpe.

44:05.352 --> 44:09.439
Defenders. Galván Luis, Killer, Olguín,

44:09.689 --> 44:14.861
Oviedo, Pagnanini,
Tarantini, and Passarella.

44:16.446 --> 44:20.992
Midfielders. Ardiles, Galván, Rubén,

44:21.159 --> 44:24.079
La Rosa, Villa, Valencia,

44:24.162 --> 44:26.706
Gallego, and Alonso.

44:28.291 --> 44:29.584
Forwards…

44:34.923 --> 44:39.719
Bertoni, Houseman,
Kempes, Luque and Ortíz.

44:41.262 --> 44:44.140
- Come on.
- Come on, man!

45:12.168 --> 45:14.254
Come on, kid, get it together.

45:17.799 --> 45:21.469
What do I tell my father now?
After everything he did for me.

45:24.806 --> 45:27.934
My dad broke his back so I could play.

45:28.017 --> 45:30.520
Next year you'll play
at the World Youth Championship.

45:30.603 --> 45:34.023
- You'll win easily!
- Yes, but this one is here.

45:36.609 --> 45:38.778
My dad dreamed of seeing me play.

46:01.342 --> 46:03.386
What are you doing out here in the cold?

46:04.804 --> 46:06.097
Cold?

46:08.475 --> 46:12.270
I'm so mad that I could walk
naked through the Cordillera.

46:14.898 --> 46:16.107
I'm sorry.

46:17.692 --> 46:21.196
- I failed you.
- How could you fail me?

46:23.907 --> 46:27.827
- I hope they're out in the first round.
- What are you saying?

46:29.621 --> 46:33.291
And when the military shoot Menotti
in the Plaza de Mayo,

46:33.374 --> 46:37.629
I'll sit in the first row to watch.

46:37.962 --> 46:39.130
Don't say that.

46:40.798 --> 46:43.593
We have to support Argentina all the same.

46:45.470 --> 46:47.639
You can't play with a boy's dream.

46:53.478 --> 46:54.854
That chickenshit.

46:54.938 --> 46:57.774
If you played for Boca,
he wouldn't dare to kick you out.

46:57.857 --> 47:00.193
But since you play for Argentinos Juniors…

47:01.319 --> 47:04.656
Your mother's right,
I'm too overbearing, don't listen to me.

47:10.119 --> 47:12.413
We'll watch Argentina matches together.

47:49.409 --> 47:52.412
WE ARGENTINES ARE JUST AND HUMANE
The fight against subversion

48:12.307 --> 48:16.978
<i>Today is a day of happiness</i>

48:17.061 --> 48:19.814
<i>for our country.</i>

48:19.897 --> 48:22.734
<i>Two events</i>

48:23.234 --> 48:26.362
<i>that are happening to this effect.</i>

48:26.946 --> 48:32.577
<i>The beginning of a sporting event</i>

48:32.869 --> 48:35.955
<i>on an international scale.</i>

48:38.791 --> 48:41.461
<i>On the other hand,</i>

48:41.544 --> 48:47.550
<i>the friendly visit</i>
<i>of thousands of men and women</i>

48:48.009 --> 48:51.888
<i>who honor us with their presence.</i>

48:52.347 --> 48:58.353
<i>I pray to God</i>
<i>for this sporting event to be truly</i>

48:58.895 --> 49:02.231
<i>a contribution</i>

49:02.732 --> 49:05.026
<i>to ensure peace.</i>

49:05.568 --> 49:09.489
<i>Therefore, with this spirit</i>

49:09.572 --> 49:14.285
<i>of friendship between our countries,</i>

49:14.535 --> 49:18.706
<i>I officially open</i>

49:19.040 --> 49:25.046
<i>the 11th Football World Cup 1978.</i>

49:32.053 --> 49:34.305
Motherfucker!

49:35.598 --> 49:38.184
Don't touch her!

49:48.778 --> 49:51.030
Kneel down.

49:51.572 --> 49:53.741
Hi. You're mine today.

49:55.118 --> 49:57.787
- Kneel down, fuck!
- Come on!

49:57.870 --> 50:01.374
Kneel down. Good.

50:01.541 --> 50:05.169
We have a pregnant new friend.

50:05.378 --> 50:08.756
Hi, Mommy, don't be afraid.

50:08.923 --> 50:10.800
Where are you going?

50:10.883 --> 50:14.554
- Is this the daddy?
- Stay still.

50:14.637 --> 50:17.890
Is this your daddy?

50:17.974 --> 50:20.518
I told you to take off your clothes.

50:20.893 --> 50:26.107
- Come on, take it all off!
- No!

51:01.350 --> 51:03.144
- Hello?
- Mrs. Tota?

51:03.311 --> 51:06.355
<i>-Yes.</i>
- How are you doing? It's Goyo.

51:06.647 --> 51:09.859
<i>Sorry to bother you at a time like this.</i>

51:10.026 --> 51:13.571
Goyo? Goyo Carrizo?

51:13.821 --> 51:17.617
<i>Yes, Goyo Carrizo</i>
<i>from Villa Fiorito, do you remember me?</i>

51:17.700 --> 51:21.704
Yes, of course I do, son.
How could I forget?

51:21.788 --> 51:24.373
<i>I wanted to tell you that today</i>

51:24.832 --> 51:27.335
- my wife and I had a baby.
- Yes.

51:27.418 --> 51:28.961
- A little boy.
<i>-Look at that.</i>

51:29.378 --> 51:31.672
<i>You know what it's like with kids.</i>

51:32.006 --> 51:35.843
I thought that maybe Diego'd like to know
and make him feel better

51:35.968 --> 51:38.221
that we named him Diego Armando.

51:39.222 --> 51:41.224
<i>His name is Diego Armando Carrizo,</i>

51:42.433 --> 51:44.018
<i>in Pelusa's honor.</i>

51:45.311 --> 51:48.439
Because I still love him
very much, you see?

51:49.232 --> 51:51.859
Yes, of course, son. Thank you very much.

51:57.114 --> 51:59.408
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

51:59.492 --> 52:01.202
My name is Nelson Arancibia.

52:01.369 --> 52:03.955
I'm the head
of the Maldonado Prosecutor's Office.

52:04.038 --> 52:05.248
- Mr. Coppola.
- Yes.

52:05.331 --> 52:07.041
I need you to come with me.

52:08.251 --> 52:11.254
Come with you?
Yes, of course. Well, all right.

52:11.337 --> 52:14.423
I hope that doesn't mean
that I'll be detained.

52:14.507 --> 52:16.133
The judge wants to see you

52:16.217 --> 52:18.302
- in the prosecutor's office.
- Fine.

52:19.971 --> 52:21.472
Excuse me.

52:25.226 --> 52:27.144
So, do we know anything else?

52:27.228 --> 52:29.981
Is the fat, good-for-nothing dead or not?

52:31.357 --> 52:33.192
We're waiting for some news.

52:36.070 --> 52:37.530
Did Coppola answer?

52:37.613 --> 52:40.908
I got his answering machine.
I left him about ten messages.

52:40.992 --> 52:43.870
And what about the court case
that they opened?

52:43.953 --> 52:47.707
The judge sealed it.
I'm trying to reach her too,

52:47.832 --> 52:51.586
but she doesn't talk to the media.
She's never given a statement.

52:53.379 --> 52:57.550
I talked to some witnesses off the record.
They all say the same thing.

52:57.884 --> 53:01.095
That, the last few days,
Maradona was out of control.

53:01.888 --> 53:07.226
He was seen at Macri's party,
unhinged, totally stoned.

53:07.310 --> 53:11.147
What I find odd is that Claudia
and the girls were at the party.

53:11.355 --> 53:14.442
Normally, he tries to behave
around the girls.

53:14.525 --> 53:17.069
Something must've happened
to end up like that.

53:17.153 --> 53:18.362
That's right.

53:19.238 --> 53:21.741
- Laura, what do you have?
- Yes.

53:22.533 --> 53:25.995
- I sorted these out.
- Okay. Good.

53:26.078 --> 53:28.080
- I like this one.
- This one?

53:28.164 --> 53:31.918
Yes. Not this one.

53:32.001 --> 53:35.087
- That one for the front page.
- All right.

53:35.254 --> 53:38.132
With this one winning
the junior World Cup in 1979.

53:38.758 --> 53:40.259
DIEGO THE GREAT!
TODAY HE ROCKS JAPAN!

53:42.053 --> 53:44.680
TOKYO, JAPAN.

53:46.849 --> 53:50.019
<i>Diego Armando Maradona leads</i>
<i>Argentina to win</i>

53:50.102 --> 53:53.564
<i>its first junior world championship ever.</i>

53:53.856 --> 53:58.110
<i>Menotti's team beats, two-nil,</i>
<i>the Soviet Union,</i>

53:58.194 --> 54:01.614
<i>one of the toughest rivals</i>
<i>in the competition.</i>

54:01.739 --> 54:05.451
<i>Argentina welcome the world champions</i>

54:05.618 --> 54:08.204
<i>and even the president joins in.</i>

54:08.287 --> 54:09.872
ARGENTINA WORLD YOUTH CHAMPIONS

54:11.791 --> 54:13.960
<i>They congratulate a few,</i>

54:14.085 --> 54:17.129
<i>while they're murdering</i>
<i>thousands of people!</i>

54:18.214 --> 54:21.092
<i>Where are our children?</i>

54:22.551 --> 54:25.221
<i>They took them alive,</i>

54:25.304 --> 54:27.640
<i>we want them back alive!</i>

54:27.974 --> 54:30.977
<i>Bring them back to us!</i>

54:31.769 --> 54:34.981
<i>Release all the missing detainees alive!</i>

54:35.064 --> 54:36.649
RELEASE THEM ALIVE

54:37.900 --> 54:40.736
<i>Stop using soccer to deceive us,</i>

54:41.362 --> 54:44.115
<i>like opium for the people!</i>

54:48.661 --> 54:51.789
<i>While they are murdering thousands…</i>

55:01.090 --> 55:04.844
<i>You can be</i>

55:05.011 --> 55:07.596
<i>legitimately proud</i>

55:08.097 --> 55:11.892
<i>of the triumph you have won</i>
<i>for the country.</i>

55:12.685 --> 55:15.980
<i>Because you have given</i>
<i>an unequivocal proof</i>

55:16.105 --> 55:19.108
<i>of order and discipline.</i>

55:19.191 --> 55:21.277
<i>This means, without a doubt,</i>

55:21.444 --> 55:26.365
<i>to recognize the principle of authority.</i>

55:33.831 --> 55:35.624
A pleasure to meet you, Maradona.

55:35.833 --> 55:38.919
Congratulations for making us look
so good before the world.

55:39.587 --> 55:41.672
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

55:45.676 --> 55:46.802
SUBVERSIVE MOTHERS

55:46.886 --> 55:49.180
THE PRESIDENT WELCOMES THE CHAMPIONS

55:49.638 --> 55:53.309
<i>Go, champions!</i>

55:56.353 --> 55:59.690
<i>Go, champions!</i>

56:19.502 --> 56:22.088
The performance of the national youth team

56:22.171 --> 56:24.590
at the World Cup was surprising.
Maradona received

56:24.673 --> 56:26.675
the Ballon D'Or as the
best player of the Cup.

56:27.635 --> 56:31.764
Goyo Carrizo never recovered from
his injury and gave up his sports career.

56:31.889 --> 56:34.725
He still lives and is known as
"the Maradona who never was".

56:35.518 --> 56:39.438
The Mothers of Plaza de Mayo demanded
the release of their children

56:39.522 --> 56:42.233
abducted by the dictatorship, alive.

56:43.359 --> 56:48.614
With meetings forbidden, they moved in
circles, thus avoiding infringing the ban.

56:48.697 --> 56:53.160
Their white scarves,
pay homage to their missing children.

56:53.244 --> 56:57.915
To this day they carry out
this ceremony every week.

56:58.290 --> 57:01.752
<i>He came back from school</i>
<i>and played soccer day and night.</i>

57:01.836 --> 57:03.838
<i>He never stopped playing.</i>

57:03.921 --> 57:07.341
<i>In his free time, he'd listen to music,</i>

57:07.424 --> 57:10.344
<i>play with his siblings.</i>
<i>He was very affectionate.</i>

57:10.427 --> 57:13.055
<i>My siblings have everything they ask for.</i>

57:13.139 --> 57:15.683
<i>They have balls that I never had.</i>

57:15.766 --> 57:19.478
<i>I don't blame my dad</i>
<i>because he was the best.</i>

57:19.562 --> 57:21.147
<i>He was always good to me.</i>

58:19.747 --> 58:22.875
<i>The goalkeeper forces him</i>
<i>to move to the side.</i>

58:22.958 --> 58:26.587
<i>Argentina has a chance</i>
<i>and Maradona scores!</i>

58:26.670 --> 58:30.257
<i>He scores a goal, two-nil!</i>
<i>Maradona the scorer,</i>

58:30.341 --> 58:33.552
