WEBVTT

00:08.007 --> 00:08.942
Oh, hi, Roz.
Oh, there
you are.

00:08.942 --> 00:10.443
I brought something
for Daphne.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.013
I was just going to leave it
with the doorman.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.414
(sobbing):
Oh...
Oh, Lord.

00:14.414 --> 00:16.349
Did I say something?

00:16.349 --> 00:17.851
Well, actually,
our doorman Morrie

00:17.851 --> 00:19.352
passed away this week.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.354
We just got back
from the funeral.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.355
Oh, my gosh.

00:22.355 --> 00:23.690
I'm so sorry.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.358
Is she going to be all right?

00:25.358 --> 00:27.227
Well, uh, you know, she's been
a little high-strung all week

00:27.227 --> 00:28.728
even before he died.

00:28.728 --> 00:30.997
I guess it's just wedding stuff,
you know.

00:30.997 --> 00:31.765
Yeah.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.666
Ooh...
sorry about that.

00:33.666 --> 00:35.935
So, you brought me something,
Roz?

00:35.935 --> 00:37.437
Well, yeah, I figured
you can't get married

00:37.437 --> 00:39.773
without wearing
something borrowed.

00:39.773 --> 00:42.108
Oh, what a beautiful garter.

00:42.108 --> 00:44.444
Look at all the lovely detail.

00:44.444 --> 00:47.147
I especially like
the little odometer.

00:49.315 --> 00:50.984
(no audio)

00:50.984 --> 00:52.786
Thank you so much, Roz.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.622
Does anybody besides me
feel like a cup of coffee?

00:55.622 --> 00:56.823
Oh, I'll brew a pot.

00:56.823 --> 00:57.590
Oh, don't be silly.

00:57.590 --> 00:58.591
I've been here enough times

00:58.591 --> 00:59.859
to know
how to get the coffee made.

00:59.859 --> 01:02.062
Daphne,
make us some coffee.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.229
Kidding.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.031
(laughing)

01:08.535 --> 01:09.536
"The Wayside Inn."

01:09.536 --> 01:12.038
Is this where you're having
the wedding?

01:12.038 --> 01:13.540
Oh, gosh,
it's just beautiful.

01:13.540 --> 01:14.507
I hope it is.

01:14.507 --> 01:15.975
The planning's
been a nightmare.

01:15.975 --> 01:17.977
I spent an hour today
on the seating chart.

01:17.977 --> 01:19.446
Everyone has
some demand.

01:19.446 --> 01:20.447
"Don't sit me
near the band."

01:20.447 --> 01:21.981
"You mind if I
bring a friend?"

01:21.981 --> 01:23.983
Oh, my God,
you can't seat me next to him.

01:23.983 --> 01:26.252
Exactly. Every selfish,
whiny, little de...

01:26.252 --> 01:29.022
no, you cannot seat me
next to Tim Walsh.

01:29.022 --> 01:31.991
I dated him all last summer
and he dumped me.

01:31.991 --> 01:33.993
He's going with my
bridesmaid, Annie.

01:33.993 --> 01:35.995
I have to seat the
bridesmaids together.

01:35.995 --> 01:37.430
This always happens to me.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.998
Is there no place I can go

01:38.998 --> 01:41.468
without running
into some guy I've dated?

01:41.468 --> 01:43.736
I was reading about
a Trappist monastery
in the Amazon

01:43.736 --> 01:45.939
that they somehow
built into the treetops.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.641
Shut up, you big doily.

01:48.641 --> 01:50.376
This is going
to be awful.

01:50.376 --> 01:51.678
Here I am at a wedding

01:51.678 --> 01:54.214
sitting next to a guy
who dumped me.

01:54.214 --> 01:55.648
FRASIER:
Oh, come on, Roz.

01:55.648 --> 01:57.117
You won't be alone.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.051
You'll be on the arm

01:58.051 --> 02:00.620
of a well-known
Seattle boulevardier

02:00.620 --> 02:01.488
and radio star.

02:01.488 --> 02:02.889
Frasier,
I can't go with you.

02:02.889 --> 02:05.391
I mean... going to a wedding
with your boss

02:05.391 --> 02:07.894
is like going to the prom
with your brother.

02:07.894 --> 02:10.395
Niles and I did not go
to the prom together!

02:11.898 --> 02:14.400
Our dates were sick
and we went stag!

02:20.073 --> 02:22.375
In retrospect, yes,
we should've canceled

02:22.375 --> 02:25.678
the horse-drawn carriage,
but hindsight is 20/20.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074

02:34.220 --> 02:35.221
(door opening)

02:35.221 --> 02:36.156
Hey... hey, Roz.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.524
ROZ:
Hi, Martin.

02:37.524 --> 02:39.359
I'm sorry to hear
about your friend, Morrie.

02:39.359 --> 02:40.827
Aw, thanks.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.362
Yeah, his wife just did
the nicest thing.

02:42.362 --> 02:43.863
I guess she knew
that Eddie and I would stop by

02:43.863 --> 02:45.365
and shoot the breeze
with him

02:45.365 --> 02:48.368
so, she gave us something
to remember him by.

02:48.368 --> 02:49.869
Oh.
(chuckles)

02:49.869 --> 02:50.870
"For Martin
and Eddie."

02:50.870 --> 02:52.172
Gee, isn't
that nice?
Yeah.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.840
I think it's some kind of wine.

02:53.840 --> 02:54.774
Well, yes,
I'd say so.

02:54.774 --> 02:56.109
(gasping)

02:56.109 --> 02:59.913
My God, Dad, this is
a 1945 Chateau Petrus.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.214
Oh, yeah?

03:01.214 --> 03:02.515
He got it from his uncle

03:02.515 --> 03:03.816
who was in France
after the war.

03:03.816 --> 03:05.952
Well, it's one of
the rarest bottles
in the world.

03:05.952 --> 03:07.854
Well, if you're good
maybe Eddie will give you

03:07.854 --> 03:09.222
a glass out of his half.

03:10.590 --> 03:13.092
I've never even seen
a '45 Petrus.

03:13.092 --> 03:14.060
Oh, poor Morrie.

03:14.594 --> 03:16.596
He probably waited
his whole life

03:16.596 --> 03:19.599
for an occasion special enough
to open that bottle.

03:19.599 --> 03:22.502
Perhaps this should be
a lesson for us all.

03:22.502 --> 03:23.836
Morrie may be

03:23.836 --> 03:25.772
standing guard at the
door to heaven right now

03:25.772 --> 03:30.777
but he is buzzing us
with one last message--

03:30.777 --> 03:33.780
"Live life now."

03:33.780 --> 03:35.748
I'm reminded
of a parable...

03:35.748 --> 03:36.616
(knocking)

03:36.616 --> 03:38.818
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.

03:38.818 --> 03:40.720
Simon!

03:40.720 --> 03:41.721
Hi, Sis.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.623
I thought you were
in California.

03:43.623 --> 03:47.060
Yeah, well, those friends I went
to surprise were out of town.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.062
So, I decided to house-sit
for them,

03:49.062 --> 03:52.565
which was lovely,
till they came home last night.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.068
I don't know what
all the screaming was about.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.903
I was the one in the tub.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.073
Where should I put this bag?

04:00.073 --> 04:02.041
Uh, by the door,
so you don't forget
it when you leave.

04:02.041 --> 04:03.376
SIMON:
Right.

04:03.376 --> 04:06.346
Well, I think I know
everybody here...

04:06.346 --> 04:07.714
or do I?

04:09.616 --> 04:12.285
What would your name be,
then, Miss?

04:12.285 --> 04:14.854
Simon... you lowlife idiot.

04:14.854 --> 04:16.755
You made a date
with me last week

04:16.755 --> 04:17.757
and you stood me up.

04:17.757 --> 04:21.761
Sorry, love, I need
a bit more to go on.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.030
Maybe this'll refresh
your memory.

04:25.331 --> 04:26.833
Roz-- of course!

04:26.833 --> 04:28.334
MARTIN (laughing):
Well...

04:28.334 --> 04:30.603
look who's back.

04:30.603 --> 04:31.304
Well, who's this, then?

04:31.304 --> 04:32.872
I'd say it was Marty Crane

04:32.872 --> 04:34.240
but he's a bit too young
and trim, eh?

04:34.240 --> 04:35.074
Oh, go on.

04:35.074 --> 04:36.909
Can I offer you a beer?

04:36.909 --> 04:38.244
Oh, I hate to drink alone.

04:38.244 --> 04:39.746
Can I have a sandwich with that?

04:39.746 --> 04:41.214
MARTIN:
Yeah.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.716
If that beer-swilling
boomerang thinks
he's staying here

04:43.716 --> 04:44.717
he's got another
think coming.

04:44.717 --> 04:46.219
(phone rings)

04:46.219 --> 04:47.220
Better get a move on.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.522
He already has your address
on his duffel bag.

04:49.522 --> 04:50.823
We better get going

04:50.823 --> 04:52.292
if we're going
to reach the cabin by dark.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.993
"Cabin"?

04:53.993 --> 04:56.262
Yes, Mel and I are celebrating
our six-month anniversary

04:56.262 --> 04:57.764
by, uh, taking
a little midweek getaway

04:57.764 --> 04:59.666
to her friend's country place.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.100
Yes, no phones, no stress--

05:01.100 --> 05:03.102
just two days
of rest and relaxation.

05:03.102 --> 05:04.103
I do have to pick up

05:04.103 --> 05:06.105
a little anniversary
gift, though.

05:06.105 --> 05:07.106
So, give me
nine minutes

05:07.607 --> 05:09.609
and meet me at the
northwest corner

05:09.609 --> 05:11.611
of Pike and
Elm at 4:42.

05:11.611 --> 05:13.112
Coming up on 4:33...

05:13.613 --> 05:14.614
Mm-hmm,
synchronizing...

05:14.614 --> 05:15.548
Now. Good.

05:15.548 --> 05:17.016
I'm relaxing already.

05:17.016 --> 05:17.950
Mmm...
Mmm...

05:17.950 --> 05:20.687
SIMON:
Thank you,
Marty.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.021
That's most
hospitable of you.

05:22.021 --> 05:23.523
Well, you have to
have a place to stay.

05:23.523 --> 05:24.991
Stop right there!

05:24.991 --> 05:26.426
He cannot stay here.

05:26.426 --> 05:28.361
The man is loud, ill-mannered...

05:28.361 --> 05:29.762
and the last time

05:29.762 --> 05:31.164
he stayed here,
he killed a ficus tree

05:31.164 --> 05:32.665
on the downstairs
neighbor's balcony

05:32.665 --> 05:36.936
by means which are best left
to the imagination.

05:36.936 --> 05:39.272
Frasier, I invited
Simon to stay

05:39.272 --> 05:40.673
in my Winnebago.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.608
Come on, Simon.
I'll show you your new digs.

05:42.608 --> 05:44.177
Oh, Lord, Simon,
you know, I'm sorry...

05:44.177 --> 05:45.611
Oh, no, no, no,
forget about it.

05:45.611 --> 05:47.680
It's no worse
than what I was just saying

05:47.680 --> 05:49.015
about you in
the kitchen.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.217
(chuckling):
Good one.

05:51.217 --> 05:52.552
He thinks I'm joking.

05:52.552 --> 05:54.487
(laughing)

05:54.487 --> 05:56.255
Join me in a
sherry, Frasier?

05:56.255 --> 05:57.523
Oh, I think I will, Niles.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.859
You know, I
have to admit

05:59.859 --> 06:01.694
I'm a little bit nervous
about this trip.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.730
I have a feeling
Mel may make another push

06:03.730 --> 06:04.697
for us to live together.

06:04.697 --> 06:05.698
Oh, my.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.200
Well, she's been bringing
it up quite a lot lately.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.236
She says it's a good way
to test our relationship.

06:10.236 --> 06:12.205
You afraid you'll discover
things about each other

06:12.205 --> 06:13.206
that you won't like?

06:13.206 --> 06:15.708
Oh, no, no-no-no,
we're past that stage.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.243
She knows my likes
and dislikes.

06:17.243 --> 06:19.746
I've... become attuned
to her various quirks...

06:20.246 --> 06:21.047
Mm-hmm.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.315
Eccentricities...

06:22.315 --> 06:23.850
bugaboos...

06:23.850 --> 06:24.851
Ah.

06:24.851 --> 06:26.352
BÃªtes noires...

06:26.352 --> 06:27.353
(chuckles)

06:27.353 --> 06:29.722
Night terrors...

06:31.591 --> 06:34.026
That's the fun of being in love.

06:34.026 --> 06:36.829
I don't know
what's bothering me.

06:36.829 --> 06:39.098
Is it possible
that your foot-dragging

06:39.098 --> 06:41.100
might have anything to do

06:41.100 --> 06:43.536
with some lingering feelings
for Daphne?

06:43.536 --> 06:46.472
Frasier, uh, you must realize
I put that behind me months ago.

06:46.472 --> 06:47.473
Just asking.

06:47.473 --> 06:48.741
I'm very happy with Mel.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.910
Well, then, what's your problem?

06:50.910 --> 06:52.812
Uh, well... let's see, uh...

06:52.812 --> 06:55.314
I just got
through a rough divorce.

06:55.314 --> 06:58.651
Uh, I do have a tendency
to be overly cautious.

06:58.651 --> 07:01.487
This could be a chance
to change all that.

07:01.487 --> 07:03.322
So, you're in favor of it?

07:03.322 --> 07:04.657
Well... I've never really been

07:05.158 --> 07:06.659
the president
of the Mel fan club,

07:06.659 --> 07:08.494
but she does seem
to make you happy,

07:08.494 --> 07:10.763
and as we were reminded
this morning,

07:10.763 --> 07:14.133
life is not to be taken
in baby steps.

07:14.133 --> 07:17.670
Ask not
for whom the doorman buzzes...

07:19.639 --> 07:21.574
Thank you.

07:21.574 --> 07:24.410
All right. That was
much-needed therapy, Frasier.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.245
Well, Niles,
it's my pleasure.

07:26.245 --> 07:27.246
You are my brother.

07:27.246 --> 07:28.748
You get the family rate.

07:28.748 --> 07:29.749
Hey, Niles.

07:29.749 --> 07:31.250
Got all the way
down to the Winnebago

07:31.250 --> 07:32.752
and realized I had
the wrong keys.

07:33.252 --> 07:35.221
I'll see you guys
in a couple of days.
Bye.

07:35.221 --> 07:37.190
You don't say, Mum?

07:37.190 --> 07:39.058
Your phlebitis again?

07:39.058 --> 07:40.026
Daphne!

07:40.026 --> 07:41.027
Oh, got to
go now, Mum.

07:41.527 --> 07:43.029
Dr. Crane's on the
warpath again. Bye.

07:43.029 --> 07:44.030
Thank you.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.498
Okay.

07:45.498 --> 07:46.933
Daph, you know,
I'm glad you're here

07:47.433 --> 07:49.435
because I was thinking
about that wine of Morrie's.

07:49.435 --> 07:51.938
You know, that's something,
really, for a special occasion.

07:51.938 --> 07:53.940
So, I'd like you to have it
for the wedding.

07:53.940 --> 07:55.341
Enjoy it on your honeymoon.

07:55.341 --> 07:57.210
(sobbing):
Oh...

07:57.210 --> 07:58.711
Mr. Crane...

07:58.711 --> 08:00.713
Oh, oh, Daphne,
come on.
That's so sweet.

08:00.713 --> 08:01.681
Come on, now.

08:01.681 --> 08:04.016
It's only a bottle
of wine.

08:04.016 --> 08:05.885
I don't even know
much about it.

08:05.885 --> 08:07.720
Frasier, help me out
here, will you?

08:07.720 --> 08:10.556
Well, Dad, Chateau Petrus
is a premier cru Bordeaux...

08:10.556 --> 08:11.524
No, no...

08:11.524 --> 08:13.493
Oh.
I-I mean
with Daphne.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.494
There you go.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.495
All right, Daph, oh...

08:15.495 --> 08:17.830
Oh...

08:17.830 --> 08:21.067
I'm sorry to get so
emotional like this.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.401
It's all right.

08:22.401 --> 08:24.904
I guess the funeral
must've really upset you.

08:24.904 --> 08:26.339
It's not that.

08:26.339 --> 08:30.309
Dr. Crane, I've
wanted to talk to you
about this all week

08:30.309 --> 08:32.311
but I haven't
known what to say.

08:32.311 --> 08:35.815
Can you promise you'll
keep this just between us?

08:35.815 --> 08:37.316
Of course.

08:37.316 --> 08:39.318
It's about your brother.

08:39.318 --> 08:41.220
You see, I know.

08:41.220 --> 08:42.522
Know what?

08:42.522 --> 08:45.791
I know about his feelings
for me.

08:45.791 --> 08:48.160
My God!

08:48.160 --> 08:50.162
How did you find out?

08:52.031 --> 08:54.300
It's not important.

08:54.300 --> 08:55.668
Somebody blabbed,
didn't they?!

08:55.668 --> 08:57.670
Why can't people mind
their own business?

08:57.670 --> 08:58.671
Who was
the nattering gossip?!

08:58.671 --> 08:59.939
Roz?! Dad?!

08:59.939 --> 09:00.506
You.

09:00.506 --> 09:02.808
What?!

09:02.808 --> 09:04.777
You were taking those pills
for your back

09:04.777 --> 09:06.279
and you blurted it out

09:06.279 --> 09:07.647
while I was giving you
a massage.

09:07.647 --> 09:10.016
Oh, well, they were
very strong pills, you see...

09:10.016 --> 09:12.018
Needless to say,
it completely took
my breath away.

09:12.518 --> 09:14.020
At first, I tried
to forget about it...

09:14.020 --> 09:17.523
put it out of my mind.
Yes, well, the bottle said
to take just one, but...

09:17.523 --> 09:19.525
Oh, will you shut up
about those pills.

09:19.525 --> 09:20.526
I'm sorry.

09:20.526 --> 09:21.827
I'm sorry, Daphne.

09:21.827 --> 09:23.596
Anyway, after a while,

09:23.596 --> 09:26.599
I couldn't put it
out of my mind anymore.

09:26.599 --> 09:30.102
I find myself thinking
about him all the time.

09:30.102 --> 09:31.437
(sobbing)

09:31.437 --> 09:33.239
Daphne...

09:33.239 --> 09:34.740
are you saying

09:34.740 --> 09:37.076
that you have feelings
for Niles?

09:37.076 --> 09:38.411
I think I do.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.912
Oh, I don't know.

09:39.912 --> 09:43.416
Even if I did, he may not feel
that way about me anymore.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.417
He's with Mel now.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.919
I don't know what
to tell you, Daph.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.921
Uh... I-I think
th-the best thing is

09:49.422 --> 09:51.857
to-to try to find a way
to talk with Niles.

09:51.857 --> 09:54.160
That's not an easy
conversation to have.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.829
It's easier now
than after you're married.

09:56.829 --> 09:57.663
You're right.

09:58.197 --> 10:00.166
I have to talk to him,
and right away.

10:00.166 --> 10:03.202
I'm already making
myself sick over this.

10:03.202 --> 10:04.704
If I leave it any longer,

10:04.704 --> 10:06.572
I'll be a complete
basket case.

10:06.572 --> 10:08.741
Uh, did he mention

10:08.741 --> 10:10.109
if he was going home?

10:10.109 --> 10:12.111
Well, uh...
(stammering)

10:12.111 --> 10:13.613
Actually, uh,

10:13.613 --> 10:16.115
he's-he's going somewhere...
else first.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.917
Um...
Where?

10:17.917 --> 10:19.385
Get you some towels

10:19.385 --> 10:21.220
and you'll be all
set down there.
Right.

10:21.220 --> 10:23.422
(sobbing)

10:23.422 --> 10:25.257
MARTIN:
Oh, geez,

10:25.257 --> 10:27.727
Daphne, it's just
a bottle of wine.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.534
(doorbell rings)

10:35.534 --> 10:37.069
DAPHNE:
I'll get it.

10:44.076 --> 10:47.046
Oh... Dr. Crane, I didn't
even know you'd gone out.

10:47.046 --> 10:49.382
I thought you might be
your brother.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.783
I went down to get the mail

10:50.783 --> 10:53.719
and got all these wedding gifts
for you, but don't worry--

10:53.719 --> 10:56.288
Niles called and said he'd be
coming by this afternoon.

10:56.288 --> 11:00.126
I don't even know how
I'm going to begin
this conversation.

11:00.126 --> 11:02.461
I'm sure those
chocolate chip-blackened teeth

11:02.461 --> 11:04.463
will be a nice icebreaker.

11:04.463 --> 11:05.898
I've been so nervous lately.

11:05.898 --> 11:08.234
I've done nothing but stuff
me self with junk food.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.535
(doorbell rings)

11:09.535 --> 11:10.336
It's him.

11:10.836 --> 11:11.837
All right, all right,
all right, fine.

11:11.837 --> 11:12.838
You're going to be
just fine, okay?

11:12.838 --> 11:14.807
Remember to speak
from the heart.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.179
Mr. Crane!

11:20.179 --> 11:21.047
Thanks.

11:21.047 --> 11:22.381
Eddie started
doing his

11:22.381 --> 11:23.683
"I-don't-know-
how-much-longer-

11:23.683 --> 11:25.117
I-can-hold-this" dance,

11:25.117 --> 11:27.353
and I just ran out
without my keys.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.021
Ever see him do that dance?

11:29.021 --> 11:32.391
Just the droll impression of it
you do at parties, Dad.

11:33.659 --> 11:36.429
You know, Mr. Crane,
Eddie seems awful fidgety.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.931
I don't think he got
enough exercise on that walk.

11:38.931 --> 11:41.901
Anybody needs any exercise, it's
you, the way you're eating now.

11:41.901 --> 11:44.336
You know, when they put
"party size" on that cookie bag

11:44.336 --> 11:46.906
they don't mean
"party of one."

11:46.906 --> 11:49.408
(doorbell rings)

11:54.380 --> 11:56.682
Simon, what
do you want?

11:56.682 --> 11:57.983
Well, I've just come
to borrow a pen

11:57.983 --> 12:00.886
so I could fill out
this job application.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.254
What? Oh,
you're applying for work?

12:02.254 --> 12:03.689
Well, here, uh, allow me.

12:03.689 --> 12:04.657
There we are.

12:04.657 --> 12:06.659
Gosh, we'll miss
you around here,

12:06.659 --> 12:08.160
but onward and upward.

12:08.661 --> 12:09.662
So, what's the job?

12:09.662 --> 12:12.198
Doorman.

12:12.198 --> 12:14.133
Dear God.

12:14.133 --> 12:17.069
Why, it's ideal for me, really.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.071
Nice, cozy chair,
plenty of time

12:19.071 --> 12:21.574
to think the long, long
thoughts of youth...

12:21.574 --> 12:25.478
not to mention what the uniforms
do for the ladies, eh, ha-ha!

12:25.478 --> 12:27.313
If memory serves,

12:27.313 --> 12:29.215
a certain bellhop
back in Manchester

12:29.715 --> 12:32.985
found that out with a young lady
who will remain nameless.

12:32.985 --> 12:34.286
Simon!

12:34.286 --> 12:35.755
I'm this close to just
poppin' him one.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.290
Now, now, Daphne, Daphne,
you just have to calm down.

12:38.290 --> 12:41.093
Here. Have a cookie.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.862
What is up with your appetite
lately?

12:42.862 --> 12:44.764
What, you knocked up
or something?

12:44.764 --> 12:45.631
Of course not, you...

12:45.631 --> 12:47.466
Now, now, you
wouldn't be

12:47.466 --> 12:50.236
the first person in our family
to be walking down the aisle

12:50.236 --> 12:52.238
carrying more
than just a bouquet.

12:52.238 --> 12:54.740
(angry muttering)
(grunting)

12:54.740 --> 12:56.642
(doorbell rings)

12:56.642 --> 12:58.010
Uh, Simon,
why don't you

12:58.010 --> 13:00.012
finish filling that out
in the kitchen,

13:00.012 --> 13:01.447
and help yourself
to a beer?

13:01.447 --> 13:04.216
Well, great.

13:09.388 --> 13:10.656
Roz!

13:10.656 --> 13:11.957
Hi, guys.

13:13.159 --> 13:15.561
Hey, Frasier, I felt kind
of bad about the other day

13:15.561 --> 13:16.562
dumping you as
my wedding date...

13:16.562 --> 13:18.063
You want me back,
don't you?

13:18.063 --> 13:21.433
...and I'm sick about it,
but I can't find anybody else.

13:21.433 --> 13:23.302
Sorry, Roz, I already
invited somebody else.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.104
She's driving up on Saturday
to join me.

13:25.104 --> 13:26.405
Get rid of her!
I need a date.

13:26.405 --> 13:27.840
I'm desperate!

13:27.840 --> 13:32.812
Well, well, somebody here
is singin' my favorite song.

13:33.746 --> 13:36.182
Simon, there's
a guy who lives

13:36.182 --> 13:38.584
in the park across
the street from me.

13:38.584 --> 13:41.086
He wears a cat suit
and meows at people.

13:41.086 --> 13:43.322
If he's busy,
maybe I'll call you.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.124
I'm prettying myself up,
just in case.

13:45.124 --> 13:46.625
Speaking of which, Daphne--

13:46.625 --> 13:49.461
I borrowed your blow-dryer
for my job interview.

13:49.461 --> 13:50.896
I spent an hour
looking for that!

13:50.896 --> 13:52.832
I thought I was losing my mind!

13:52.832 --> 13:54.800
Well, that does happen to women
in your condition--

13:54.800 --> 13:56.101
you know, in a family way...

13:56.101 --> 13:57.236
You're pregnant?!

13:57.236 --> 13:59.071
I am not pregnant!

13:59.071 --> 14:01.540
What, just another scare, then,
like that time back in school

14:01.540 --> 14:02.908
with that Pakistani chap?

14:02.908 --> 14:05.311
That's it, you pig!

14:05.311 --> 14:06.745
Ooh. Put me down.

14:06.745 --> 14:08.747
Daphne and I are going out
for a breath of fresh air,

14:08.747 --> 14:10.716
perhaps to retrieve
her blow-dryer.

14:10.716 --> 14:12.585
Oh, if Niles should happen
to stop by, keep him here.

14:13.085 --> 14:15.020
There's something important
I need to discuss with him.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.289
Oh, for God's sake,
put me down.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.391
Not until you promise
not to kill your brother.

14:19.391 --> 14:20.726
Oh, all right.

14:20.726 --> 14:22.561
It's not as if he
doesn't deserve it.

14:22.561 --> 14:24.396
Telling everyone
I'm carrying Donny's baby--

14:24.396 --> 14:26.398
like I don't have enough
to worry about today

14:26.899 --> 14:27.766
waiting for Dr. Crane.

14:27.766 --> 14:30.669
Daphne, Daphne,
you have to calm down.

14:30.669 --> 14:31.971
It's not easy.

14:31.971 --> 14:34.340
I don't even know how
to begin with him.

14:34.340 --> 14:36.876
"Would you like steak
or salmon at my wedding?

14:36.876 --> 14:40.379
And by the way, I think
I might be in love with you."

14:40.379 --> 14:41.881
Daphne, you'll
find the words

14:41.881 --> 14:44.250
when the time
comes, all right?

14:44.250 --> 14:46.151
Don't pretend you're not
listening, Mrs. Richman.

14:46.151 --> 14:50.155
Your laundry is not
that interesting.

14:50.155 --> 14:52.458
Oh, come on,
George.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.260
I'm desperate here.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.028
I promise you a good time.

14:56.028 --> 14:57.329
I mean a really
good time,

14:57.830 --> 14:59.832
if you get my drift.

14:59.832 --> 15:03.836
You might have mentioned
I was on speaker phone.

15:06.472 --> 15:08.974
Listen to what
you're doing, Roz.

15:08.974 --> 15:10.976
It's not very
dignified, is it?

15:10.976 --> 15:13.846
Come on, Roz, give
Simon a chance.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.681
What, so he can
stand me up again?

15:15.681 --> 15:17.616
And miss my sister's wedding?
Never.

15:17.616 --> 15:20.119
Well, if you're worried
about my appearance,

15:20.119 --> 15:23.989
I know where I can get my hands
on some very nice Armani suits.

15:23.989 --> 15:26.158
Or you can just grab one
out of Frasier's closet.

15:26.158 --> 15:28.794
What do you think
he was talking about?

15:30.162 --> 15:31.630
All right...

15:31.630 --> 15:35.134
but, Simon, just remember--
my ex-boyfriend will be there.

15:35.134 --> 15:37.670
If anybody asks,
you're an Internet millionaire.

15:37.670 --> 15:41.540
Right. I'll be your perfect
well-bred, upmarket gentleman.

15:41.540 --> 15:42.942
Now, I'll walk you
to the garage.

15:42.942 --> 15:43.943
Oh, you don't have to.

15:43.943 --> 15:47.279
Oh, it's no bother--
I live there.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.115
Roz!
Niles!

15:50.115 --> 15:51.617
Simon!

15:51.617 --> 15:54.119
Well, by the look of
that smile on your face,

15:54.119 --> 15:56.989
I'd say somebody got
himself a bit last night.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.825
I find that remark
rude, boorish...

15:59.825 --> 16:02.194
and impossible to deny!

16:03.228 --> 16:05.698
Brilliant!

16:10.803 --> 16:12.638
Niles, how was your trip?

16:12.638 --> 16:14.139
Oh, fantastic, Dad.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.140
Where's Frasier?
I have some news.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.642
Oh, he'll be back
in a bit. What's up?

16:16.642 --> 16:18.143
Oh, uh, well, I should
wait for Frasier.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.645
It was really his idea.
Do you mind?

16:19.645 --> 16:21.146
I can wait.
Okay.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.649
I can't.
What is it?

16:23.649 --> 16:25.884
I'm married.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.955
Married?

16:29.955 --> 16:31.790
Yes. Mel and I eloped yesterday.

16:31.790 --> 16:33.125
Well?

16:33.125 --> 16:34.493
Well...

16:34.493 --> 16:36.996
congratulations, son!

16:36.996 --> 16:38.998
That's great.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.433
So, uh, you're
happy, right?

16:41.433 --> 16:45.304
Oh, happy? I'm delirious.

16:45.304 --> 16:48.507
Yeah, you'd have to be,
wouldn't you?

16:52.778 --> 16:55.781
So, uh, you say
this was Frasier's idea?

16:55.781 --> 16:57.282
Well, indirectly, yeah.

16:57.282 --> 16:58.784
Oh, before I forget,
it occurred to me--

16:58.784 --> 17:00.786
I think we should keep this
from Daphne and Donny.

17:01.286 --> 17:02.254
I would hate for them
to think

17:02.254 --> 17:04.022
that we're stealing
their thunder.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.324
Oh, Niles.

17:05.324 --> 17:06.191
Frasier.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.992
Three guesses what
I did yesterday.
What?

17:07.992 --> 17:08.894
Daphne.

17:08.894 --> 17:10.162
Dr. Crane.

17:10.162 --> 17:10.829
Send Daphne away.

17:10.829 --> 17:13.065
Get rid of your father.

17:13.065 --> 17:14.400
Daphne, could you go
to the drugstore?

17:14.400 --> 17:15.901
I'm all out of liniment

17:15.901 --> 17:17.368
and my back's getting
kind of achy.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.137
Dad, that's because
you've been sitting
in that chair all day.

17:19.137 --> 17:20.439
I tell you what, you know
what you could use?

17:20.939 --> 17:22.441
A good walk
to the drugstore.

17:22.441 --> 17:23.442
It'll do you a world of good.

17:23.942 --> 17:24.943
I'll go with you.
Oh-oh, okay.
All right.

17:25.444 --> 17:26.377
Niles, why don't
you come, too?

17:26.878 --> 17:27.880
Yeah, we'll all go.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.381
No! No, there's something
very important

17:29.381 --> 17:31.884
I need to discuss
with Dad, Niles.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.385
I'm sure you understand.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.319
Fras!

17:36.488 --> 17:39.058
(phone rings)
Oh, excuse me.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.127
Hello? Mel, darling.

17:42.127 --> 17:44.363
No, just hanging
out with Daphne.

17:44.363 --> 17:46.331
Honestly, Dad, when will
you learn to take a hint?

17:46.331 --> 17:48.167
I can't take a hint?!

17:48.167 --> 17:49.835
Couldn't you see that Niles
wanted to talk to you?

17:49.835 --> 17:51.070
Whatever it is,
he can wait.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.104
Oh, yeah, no big deal.

17:52.104 --> 17:53.605
He just got married,
that's all.
What?!

17:53.605 --> 17:55.474
He eloped with Mel
yesterday.

17:55.474 --> 17:56.642
Poor Daphne.

17:56.642 --> 17:58.010
Would you please keep out
of this, Mrs. Richmond!

17:58.010 --> 17:59.511
We have got to
get back up there!

17:59.511 --> 18:00.512
We're going
to the basement!

18:00.512 --> 18:02.915
I can't wait that long!

18:05.284 --> 18:08.153
See you later... darling.

18:08.153 --> 18:09.655
Sorry about that.

18:09.655 --> 18:10.989
Oh, it's all right.

18:10.989 --> 18:15.060
So, 48 hours till the big day--
you must be pretty excited.

18:15.060 --> 18:17.896
It's funny
you should mention that.

18:17.896 --> 18:20.232
You see, Dr. Crane...

18:20.232 --> 18:21.567
Yes, Daphne?

18:21.567 --> 18:23.435
(yelling):
Niles!

18:29.508 --> 18:32.411
Dr. Crane! You're
back awfully soon.

18:32.411 --> 18:34.980
And you-you're
all out of breath.

18:34.980 --> 18:36.381
Is something wrong?

18:36.381 --> 18:38.250
Uh, no, no. It's just
that there's something

18:38.250 --> 18:39.618
I need to discuss
with Niles.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.487
What, now? We were
just having a chat.

18:41.487 --> 18:43.255
Well, I'm sure it
can wait, Daphne.

18:43.255 --> 18:44.523
Daphne, Daphne, I need
to talk to Frasier, too--

18:44.523 --> 18:46.525
if you don't mind.
Oh, of course not.

18:46.525 --> 18:50.496
It's not like I had anything
important to talk about!

18:52.998 --> 18:55.467
Daphne all right?

18:55.467 --> 18:58.403
Well, it's just, uh,
wedding stuff, I guess.

18:58.403 --> 19:01.807
Uh, speaking of which,
I-I understand you have

19:01.807 --> 19:03.575
some... some news?

19:03.575 --> 19:06.011
You're... married?

19:06.011 --> 19:07.446
Yes. I guess Dad couldn't
contain himself

19:07.446 --> 19:09.281
any more than I could.

19:09.281 --> 19:11.350
I thought you were
just going to move
in together.

19:11.350 --> 19:13.152
Well, so did I, but the
strangest thing happened.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.120
As we talked about it,
we got more and more excited

19:15.120 --> 19:16.622
about the idea
of being together,

19:16.622 --> 19:19.091
and then I remembered
your advice

19:19.091 --> 19:22.861
to stop taking baby
steps through life.

19:22.861 --> 19:24.229
Before we knew it,

19:24.229 --> 19:25.731
we were asking the waitress
for a phone book

19:25.731 --> 19:28.133
so we could find
a justice of the peace!

19:28.133 --> 19:29.168
(doorbell rings)

19:29.668 --> 19:32.137
What can I say but...
congratulations?

19:32.638 --> 19:35.574
Martin... or should
I say Dad?

19:35.574 --> 19:38.810
Yeah. I heard.

19:38.810 --> 19:40.145
Hello.

19:40.145 --> 19:41.580
Darling, darling,
it occurred to me

19:41.580 --> 19:44.950
I think perhaps we should try
to keep this quiet from Daphne.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.785
Keep what quiet?

19:46.785 --> 19:50.122
Oh, we can't keep something
like this a secret.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.557
We got married.

19:53.458 --> 19:54.927
Did you?

19:54.927 --> 19:56.762
NILES:
Yes. While we
were out of town.

19:56.762 --> 19:59.198
But the last thing we want
is to upstage you and Donny

19:59.198 --> 20:02.467
so we are not mentioning
this outside this room.

20:03.268 --> 20:05.771
Well, I am just

20:05.771 --> 20:08.273
so happy for you both.

20:08.273 --> 20:10.676
We're having champagne.
Would you like to join us?

20:10.676 --> 20:13.111
I'd love to, but I have to get
a check down to the caterer's.

20:13.111 --> 20:14.580
They're closing
early today.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.081
Let me drive you
over, Daph.

20:16.081 --> 20:17.349
Oh, no, I'm fine.

20:17.349 --> 20:19.618
Congratulations again.

20:19.618 --> 20:22.020
Oh, save a glass for me.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.293
(sobbing)

20:42.708 --> 20:43.709
This is the lounge.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.210
Through there
is the dining area

20:45.210 --> 20:46.778
where the rehearsal
dinner will be.

20:46.778 --> 20:47.713
This is lovely.

20:47.713 --> 20:49.181
Say, have you seen
the bride-to-be yet?

20:49.181 --> 20:50.682
I'd like to have
a word with her.

20:50.682 --> 20:51.550
No, I haven't.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.018
So, I thought we'd
have the toast

20:53.018 --> 20:54.086
right before dessert.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.554
Dr. Crane!

20:55.554 --> 20:57.956
Gosh, Daphne, I was wondering
where you'd gotten to yesterday.

20:57.956 --> 20:59.925
After the caterers
I went straight to Donny's

20:59.925 --> 21:01.860
so we could leave
bright and early together.

21:01.860 --> 21:03.762
It's lovely up here,
isn't it?
Oh, yes.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.764
Anybody else want something
from the bar?

21:05.764 --> 21:06.565
Um, Scotch rocks.

21:06.565 --> 21:08.133
Donny, it's barely noon.

21:08.133 --> 21:09.868
Isn't that when your mom
said she'd be here?

21:09.868 --> 21:11.403
Give him a double.

21:11.403 --> 21:12.771
Um, Daphne, I was
actually hoping...

21:12.771 --> 21:14.673
I'll have
whatever he's having.

21:14.673 --> 21:15.674
Roz.

21:16.174 --> 21:17.676
I don't even know why
I came to this wedding.

21:17.676 --> 21:18.610
Hi, Daphne.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.446
I was all set
to drive up here myself

21:21.446 --> 21:22.814
when I think "wait a minute.

21:22.814 --> 21:24.316
"I can't walk
into that lobby alone.

21:24.316 --> 21:25.651
What if my ex-boyfriend
is here?"

21:25.651 --> 21:27.886
So, I agreed
to drive up with Simon.

21:27.886 --> 21:29.254
There I am

21:29.254 --> 21:30.756
standing on the curb
with my garment bag

21:30.756 --> 21:32.257
and what does he pull up in?

21:32.257 --> 21:33.158
Your father's Winnebago.

21:33.158 --> 21:34.559
Thank you.

21:34.559 --> 21:36.561
Don't go anywhere.

21:36.561 --> 21:39.064
Next thing I know,
we're heading down the highway

21:39.064 --> 21:41.566
in the wrong direction
towards the airport.

21:41.566 --> 21:42.367
Hey...

21:42.367 --> 21:43.468
I wasn't kidding.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.237
Turns out he's promised

21:45.237 --> 21:47.539
to ferry your entire family
up here.

21:47.539 --> 21:48.874
All 14 of them?

21:48.874 --> 21:50.208
Fifteen. Your Aunt Ida

21:50.208 --> 21:51.710
got the weekend off
from the bakery.

21:51.710 --> 21:53.211
Judging by the size of her,

21:53.211 --> 21:55.147
it'll be the first Saturday
they turn a profit.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.982
You know, Donny,

21:56.982 --> 21:58.884
maybe you could take Roz
out for a walk

21:58.884 --> 22:00.952
in that rejuvenating country air

22:00.952 --> 22:02.754
while I have a word
with your fiancee?

22:02.754 --> 22:04.056
Come on, Roz,
let's go.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.357
You don't mind if I just
take this with me, do you?

22:05.357 --> 22:07.159
Well, uh...
I didn't think so.

22:07.959 --> 22:09.761
Daphne, I wanted
you to know

22:10.262 --> 22:12.764
that I'm just
completely devastated

22:12.764 --> 22:14.032
by what happened.

22:14.032 --> 22:16.068
It's all right, Dr. Crane.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.869
It's just when I advised you
to have a chat with Niles

22:17.869 --> 22:20.238
I had no idea he'd run off
and get married.

22:20.238 --> 22:22.574
I know your concern for me,
but I'm fine.

22:22.574 --> 22:24.576
I thought about it
all last night,

22:24.576 --> 22:26.078
and I realized
what I was feeling

22:26.078 --> 22:28.080
was just wedding jitters.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.581
I do love your brother,

22:29.581 --> 22:31.583
but I'm in love with Donny.

22:31.583 --> 22:34.419
You're not just putting on
a brave face?

22:34.419 --> 22:35.721
No.

22:35.721 --> 22:39.491
I'm a bit embarrassed now,
making you worry for no reason.

22:39.491 --> 22:40.759
Oh, it's all right, Daphne.

22:40.759 --> 22:42.160
It's what I do.

22:42.160 --> 22:45.030
You've always been
such a wonderful friend.

22:45.530 --> 22:48.033
In fact, I brought this
for the honeymoon,

22:48.033 --> 22:50.335
but I'd like you to have it.

22:50.335 --> 22:51.103
Oh, Daphne, I couldn't.

22:51.603 --> 22:52.604
Donny and I
aren't wine drinkers.

22:52.604 --> 22:54.072
I wouldn't dream
of it. Really.

22:54.072 --> 22:55.006
All right, I'll keep it.

22:55.006 --> 22:57.409
Now I've hurt your feelings.
Here.

22:57.409 --> 22:58.877
Gosh, Daphne...

22:58.877 --> 23:00.412
I tell you what.

23:00.412 --> 23:02.414
I promise
that when I do drink this,

23:02.414 --> 23:03.782
I'll be thinking of you.

23:03.782 --> 23:05.884
Oh, come here.

23:05.884 --> 23:08.553
Oh, Daph.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.689
There's my baby.

23:10.689 --> 23:12.023
Hi, Mummy.

23:12.524 --> 23:15.427
(both groan happily)

23:15.427 --> 23:16.828
Mum, this is...

23:16.828 --> 23:18.330
Oh, I know who he is, love.

23:18.330 --> 23:20.332
I want to thank you, Donny,

23:20.332 --> 23:23.702
for rescuing my daughter
from that horrible Dr. Crane.

23:23.702 --> 23:25.904
Well, actually...
Every time

23:25.904 --> 23:28.707
I call her, I'm not on the phone
five minutes

23:28.707 --> 23:31.209
before that tyrant
is ordering her to hang up.

23:31.209 --> 23:32.711
Cup of tea, please.

23:32.711 --> 23:35.714
I thought my daughter might get
me one, but she didn't.

23:37.215 --> 23:40.185
God, this seat's
worse than the Winnebago.

23:40.185 --> 23:42.220
Though not half as uncomfortable

23:42.220 --> 23:44.156
as that sardine tin of a room

23:44.156 --> 23:45.557
you arranged for me.

23:45.557 --> 23:47.559
Oh, God, can't bear
the smell of that.

23:47.559 --> 23:48.560
Take it away.

23:48.560 --> 23:49.461
Oh...

23:49.461 --> 23:50.796
Reminds me of the salmon

23:50.796 --> 23:52.798
they served on the airplane.

23:52.798 --> 23:55.200
Oh, if it doesn't have me
hurling me guts out,

23:55.200 --> 23:57.169
it'll be by God's
own intervention.

23:58.637 --> 24:00.639
Now give your new mum a kiss,
Donny.

24:00.639 --> 24:01.640
Oh, actually, Mum,

24:01.640 --> 24:02.641
this isn't Donny.

24:02.641 --> 24:03.642
DONNY:
Oh, is this Mum?

24:03.642 --> 24:04.643
This is Donny.

24:04.643 --> 24:06.077
Hi.

24:06.077 --> 24:07.579
Well, come here.
Let's have a look at you.

24:07.579 --> 24:10.315
We've be starting to think
our Daphne

24:10.315 --> 24:11.950
would never find herself
a young man.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.386
And I see she hasn't.

24:14.386 --> 24:16.788
Well, beggars
can't be choosers.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.256
Well, I'm going
to go and see

24:18.256 --> 24:20.759
if your father's stomach
is feeling any better.

24:20.759 --> 24:22.694
He keeps saying it's tension.

24:22.694 --> 24:25.997
What he's got to be tense about,
I'll never know.

24:27.699 --> 24:30.936
I was worried she'd be
in one of her dark moods.

24:37.576 --> 24:39.010
(crowd talking)

24:39.010 --> 24:41.580
Daphne's brothers know how
to let loose, don't they?

24:41.580 --> 24:43.548
MARTIN:
Boy, I'll say.
Now, listen, about their names.

24:43.548 --> 24:45.550
The one who'll eat anything
on a bet, that's Nigel.

24:45.550 --> 24:47.052
No, no, that's Peter.

24:47.052 --> 24:49.054
Nigel's the one
whose Band-Aid he ate.

24:49.054 --> 24:50.055
See ya.

24:50.055 --> 24:52.057
Hey, Fras.

24:52.057 --> 24:53.058
Had enough, huh?

24:53.058 --> 24:55.060
Oh, yeah.

24:55.060 --> 24:56.561
I think I hit
my limit

24:56.561 --> 24:58.063
when in the middle of my toast

24:58.563 --> 25:00.999
I looked down and there was
a man chewing on my boutonniere.

25:00.999 --> 25:04.503
Oh, God, it's been
a hell of a week.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.906
I still can't get
over Niles and Mel.

25:07.906 --> 25:11.142
Didn't see that coming.

25:11.142 --> 25:12.944
Well, at least he says
she makes him happy.

25:12.944 --> 25:14.412
So there's nothing
you can do about it.

25:14.412 --> 25:16.848
Actually...

25:16.848 --> 25:18.350
Fras, don't even think

25:18.350 --> 25:19.851
about trying to talk
him out of it.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.353
He's married.
End of story.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.855
It's really
not that simple, Dad.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.357
You see...

25:25.357 --> 25:27.859
I shouldn't be talking
to you about this.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.261
Is this about Daphne?

25:29.261 --> 25:31.930
Why do you say that?

25:31.930 --> 25:32.697
Oh, come on, I got eyes.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.199
I know something's going on.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.001
I seen the way
she's been looking at him.

25:36.001 --> 25:40.405
She found out how Niles has felt
about her all these years.

25:40.405 --> 25:41.840
You're kidding?

25:41.840 --> 25:43.775
How'd she find out?

25:43.775 --> 25:45.710
That's not important
right now, Dad.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.178
The problem is that she told me

25:47.178 --> 25:49.114
that she might have
the same feelings for him.

25:49.114 --> 25:50.148
Oh, geez.

25:50.649 --> 25:53.151
Of course,
then Niles shows up married.

25:53.151 --> 25:55.654
Now she says
it's just jitters.

25:55.654 --> 25:57.656
Well, you can't
tell Niles all this.

25:57.656 --> 25:59.558
He says he's
happy with Mel.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.493
She says she's happy with Donny.

26:01.493 --> 26:03.461
And I'm not sure I believe
either one of them.

26:03.461 --> 26:04.829
Just remember, Fras,

26:04.829 --> 26:06.665
there are two marriages
on the line here.

26:06.665 --> 26:08.667
So, before you get involved,
you better make damn sure

26:08.667 --> 26:09.935
you know what you're doing.

26:13.038 --> 26:15.674
Who blabbed? Roz?

26:15.674 --> 26:18.843
Yes, but she feels terrible.

26:20.011 --> 26:20.845
Hello, boys.

26:20.845 --> 26:22.247
Hey...

26:22.247 --> 26:25.183
A pack of smokes,
please, barkeep.

26:25.183 --> 26:27.586
Oh, lovely spot,
isn't it?

26:27.586 --> 26:29.988
I just took a nice
little stroll outside

26:29.988 --> 26:31.489
around the wishing well.

26:31.489 --> 26:32.457
Oh.

26:32.457 --> 26:33.959
That'll be four
dollars, please.

26:33.959 --> 26:34.793
Oh, yeah, right.

26:34.793 --> 26:37.095
This ought to cover it.

26:37.095 --> 26:38.863
(coins clattering)

26:40.131 --> 26:42.033
Tim, what a surprise.

26:42.033 --> 26:44.869
I had no idea
you'd be here.

26:44.869 --> 26:46.171
Simon...

26:46.171 --> 26:47.138
come here.

26:47.138 --> 26:49.107
Show time.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.112
Simon, this is
my old friend Tim.

26:54.112 --> 26:56.114
He's a computer programmer.

26:56.114 --> 26:57.515
Oh, what a
coincidence.

26:57.515 --> 27:00.251
With me owning
my own software company.

27:00.251 --> 27:03.555
Really? What sort of
applications are you focused on?

27:03.555 --> 27:05.557
Voice recognition,
data encryption,

27:05.557 --> 27:07.525
something I'm working on
for NASA.

27:07.525 --> 27:10.328
Can't discuss that one.

27:10.328 --> 27:11.630
Oh, very impressive.

27:11.630 --> 27:12.631
And Roz, are you
still producing?

27:12.631 --> 27:14.132
I'll say she is.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.634
(hearty laugh)

27:17.402 --> 27:20.171
Excuse me.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.175
Mind if we
join you guys?

27:24.175 --> 27:25.644
Oh, please.
Sure.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.646
There's plenty of room.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.147
Give me a beer, please.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.582
Sorry we didn't
get a toast

27:30.582 --> 27:32.050
out of you,
Mr. Crane.

27:32.050 --> 27:32.917
Oh, I'm sorry.

27:32.917 --> 27:34.419
I really wanted to, Daphne.

27:34.419 --> 27:35.820
But I just felt kind of awkward.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.555
Oh, it's all right.

27:37.555 --> 27:39.357
Anyway, I should
be toasting you.

27:39.357 --> 27:42.193
I'm going to miss you,
you rotten old sod.

27:42.193 --> 27:43.461
BARTENDER:
Ballentine okay?

27:43.461 --> 27:45.764
Oh, yeah, that's my beer.

27:45.764 --> 27:47.098
Yes.

27:47.098 --> 27:48.566
You know, I just found out

27:48.566 --> 27:49.567
they're going to quit
making this stuff.

27:49.567 --> 27:51.069
Really?
Yeah.

27:51.069 --> 27:52.070
There's an end of a era.

27:52.070 --> 27:53.505
That's right.

27:53.505 --> 27:57.542
It's going to be one sad day
when I get down to my last one.

27:57.542 --> 28:00.345
You know,
it's funny...

28:00.345 --> 28:03.682
you get used to having something
in your life.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.183
It's part of your day.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.052
Just take it for granted.

28:07.052 --> 28:09.421
Then suddenly it's gone,

28:09.421 --> 28:14.459
and you realize
how much it meant to you.

28:14.459 --> 28:17.429
(slow music starts)

28:17.429 --> 28:20.398
Hey, guys, great party.

28:20.398 --> 28:22.767
Oh, uh, Mel,
why don't you take my seat?

28:22.767 --> 28:24.703
I'm going to sit here
and enjoy the music.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.704
I'll join you, Fras.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.172
Take my beer over there.

28:27.172 --> 28:28.573
I just want to go
to the restroom.

28:28.573 --> 28:30.442
You know, seeing
that this is my

28:30.442 --> 28:32.444
last night as a
carefree bachelor,

28:32.944 --> 28:34.446
would you care
to dance, Miss?

28:34.446 --> 28:35.947
I'd love to.

28:35.947 --> 28:36.815
Uh-oh.

28:44.222 --> 28:46.224
Well, certainly picked
the perfect spot

28:46.224 --> 28:47.726
for your wedding.

28:47.726 --> 28:48.727
It is, isn't it?

28:48.727 --> 28:51.529
We're doing the ceremony
in the garden.

28:51.529 --> 28:53.131
Oh. It'll be beautiful.

28:56.434 --> 28:58.903
I love this song.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.839
Well, where are my manners?

29:00.839 --> 29:02.173
Would you like to dance?

29:02.173 --> 29:03.575
All right.

29:03.575 --> 29:07.345
Give us a chance to keep
an eye on those two.

29:15.019 --> 29:17.355
Oh... it's been a while

29:17.355 --> 29:20.225
since we've
danced together.

29:20.225 --> 29:22.093
Yes, it has.

29:23.928 --> 29:25.797
Thanks for dinner.

29:26.297 --> 29:29.267
It's been a
wonderful evening.

29:29.267 --> 29:31.703
It's one of those times

29:31.703 --> 29:34.038
you just don't
want to end.

29:37.909 --> 29:40.745
(song ends, applause)

29:40.745 --> 29:43.948
(new song begins)

29:43.948 --> 29:45.817
Excuse me, sir.

29:45.817 --> 29:47.752
You mind if I cut in?

29:47.752 --> 29:48.720
Not at all.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.188
Thank you.

29:50.188 --> 29:51.723
Darling.

30:10.208 --> 30:12.277
What in the world
was so urgent

30:12.277 --> 30:14.779
that you brought me
all the way up here?

30:14.779 --> 30:16.281
Niles, just sit down.

30:16.281 --> 30:18.283
Something I need
to discuss with you.

30:18.283 --> 30:19.217
Uh...

30:21.286 --> 30:24.622
I was watching you
on the dance floor just now

30:24.622 --> 30:28.259
and the look in your eyes
was unmistakable.

30:28.259 --> 30:29.594
Well, can you blame me?

30:29.594 --> 30:31.095
Mel's quite the little dancer.

30:31.095 --> 30:33.097
Of course, her vertigo
does rule out

30:33.097 --> 30:34.866
any serious twirling, but...

30:34.866 --> 30:38.603
Niles, I'm talking about Daphne.

30:38.603 --> 30:41.306
The way you
were looking at her...

30:41.306 --> 30:44.475
well, it just breaks my heart.

30:44.475 --> 30:45.810
Frasier, it was one thing

30:45.810 --> 30:48.313
when you were beating this drum
the other day,

30:48.313 --> 30:49.314
but I'm married now.

30:49.314 --> 30:51.316
What's it going to take
to convince you

30:51.316 --> 30:52.283
that I am over her?

30:52.283 --> 30:54.152
She knows.

30:54.152 --> 30:56.454
What?

30:56.454 --> 30:58.289
Daphne knows that you
have feelings for her.

30:58.289 --> 30:59.757
She's known for some time.

30:59.757 --> 31:01.125
How?

31:02.560 --> 31:05.463
Well, it's a long story.

31:07.165 --> 31:08.967
I think Roz said something.

31:08.967 --> 31:11.903
Anyway, she knows.

31:11.903 --> 31:14.806
I knew you thought
my marriage to Mel was hasty

31:14.806 --> 31:16.207
but to poison it like this?

31:16.207 --> 31:18.276
I'm not going
to listen to this.

31:18.276 --> 31:20.278
Niles, Daphne feels
the same way about you.

31:23.214 --> 31:26.117
At least I think
she does.

31:26.117 --> 31:27.485
She told me as much
the other day

31:27.485 --> 31:29.387
and then she denied it
once you got married.

31:29.387 --> 31:31.756
But I saw the way
she was looking at you

31:31.756 --> 31:33.625
downstairs just now.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.226
Oh, my God.

31:35.226 --> 31:36.494
Niles, I'm not in the habit

31:36.494 --> 31:37.862
of breaking up
people's marriages.

31:37.862 --> 31:40.098
But how could I
not tell you?

31:40.098 --> 31:41.466
You're my brother.

31:41.466 --> 31:42.767
I love you.

31:42.767 --> 31:43.601
(knocking)

31:44.102 --> 31:45.603
MEL:
Niles, darling?

31:45.603 --> 31:46.604
Yes, honey?

31:46.604 --> 31:48.573
You left
with our only room key.

31:48.573 --> 31:49.607
Oh, oh. Here.

31:49.607 --> 31:51.609
I'll let you through this way.

31:51.609 --> 31:53.111
I am so sorry.

31:53.111 --> 31:54.479
It's all right.

31:54.479 --> 31:57.382
You have a whole lifetime
to make it up to me.

31:57.382 --> 32:00.385
(chuckling nervously)

32:00.385 --> 32:02.387
(gasping)

32:08.159 --> 32:09.661
This is awful.

32:09.661 --> 32:11.195
I love Mel.

32:11.195 --> 32:13.197
It's just...

32:13.197 --> 32:14.699
Oh, I know.
I know.

32:14.699 --> 32:17.135
I have to talk to Daphne.

32:17.135 --> 32:18.536
Come with me.

32:18.536 --> 32:20.071
Maybe while I'm
speaking to her,

32:20.071 --> 32:22.106
you can find some way
to occupy...

32:22.106 --> 32:23.107
Donny!
Hello, Daphne.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.609
Hey, Doc.
Things were getting

32:24.609 --> 32:26.110
a little too wild
for us down there.

32:26.611 --> 32:27.612
Oh, just as well.

32:27.612 --> 32:28.980
We all have
a very big day tomorrow.

32:28.980 --> 32:31.582
About that, Daphne,
can I have a word with you?

32:31.582 --> 32:32.417
All right.
Go ahead.

32:32.417 --> 32:33.384
I'm going to get
out of these shoes,

32:33.384 --> 32:34.819
and I'll see you
in a few minutes. Good night.

32:34.819 --> 32:38.222
You know, I'll just
brave the horde,

32:38.222 --> 32:40.224
see if I can get myself
a nightcap.

32:40.224 --> 32:42.694
Uh... good night.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.028
Come in.

32:48.533 --> 32:50.034
So, Daphne?

32:50.034 --> 32:51.035
Yes?

32:52.537 --> 32:54.439
May I offer you
something to drink?

32:54.439 --> 32:55.707
Um, no, thank you.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.041
Oh, all right.

32:57.041 --> 32:59.844
Anyway, Daphne...

32:59.844 --> 33:00.611
Perhaps an Orangina.

33:01.079 --> 33:01.980
Oh, all right.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.848
Maybe I'll join you.

33:03.848 --> 33:06.351
Funny thing
about Orangina--

33:06.351 --> 33:08.619
I never buy
Orangina at home,

33:08.619 --> 33:10.455
but whenever I'm in a hotel
and there's a mini-bar,

33:10.455 --> 33:12.457
it's the first thing I go for.

33:12.457 --> 33:14.459
Orangina.

33:24.769 --> 33:28.773
Anyway... I was
just talk...

33:28.773 --> 33:31.242
talking to Frasier
about a conversation

33:31.242 --> 33:32.643
you two had.

33:32.643 --> 33:33.511
Oh, dear.

33:33.511 --> 33:34.512
No, no.

33:34.512 --> 33:35.513
Don't get upset.

33:35.513 --> 33:36.914
I specifically asked him

33:36.914 --> 33:37.982
not to say anything.

33:37.982 --> 33:38.883
What was he thinking?

33:38.883 --> 33:40.218
No, I'm glad he told me.

33:40.218 --> 33:42.186
Oh, yes. So we can have
a big talk about it.

33:42.186 --> 33:44.188
That's what
you psychiatrists always do--

33:44.188 --> 33:45.456
drag everything
out in the open

33:45.456 --> 33:46.657
so we can work
through it

33:46.657 --> 33:48.526
no matter how awkward
it might be.

33:48.526 --> 33:49.927
Well,
I just don't see the point.

33:49.927 --> 33:51.796
Daphne, I'm glad he told me

33:51.796 --> 33:54.232
because I love you.

33:57.068 --> 33:58.469
(laughing):
Excuse me.

33:58.469 --> 33:59.470
Dad?

33:59.470 --> 34:00.471
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:00.471 --> 34:01.472
I thought you were in here
with Frasier.

34:01.472 --> 34:02.940
The boys
are playing a game

34:02.940 --> 34:05.910
called William Tell
with the seltzer hose, and...

34:07.945 --> 34:09.914
Uh, oh, well, uh... anyway.

34:09.914 --> 34:13.918
Why don't you two just go on
doing whatever you were doing,

34:13.918 --> 34:15.420
and I'll just, uh...

34:15.420 --> 34:18.889
I'll be down in the lobby
by the fireplace.

34:20.324 --> 34:23.161
Dr. Crane,
you shouldn't say such things.

34:23.161 --> 34:24.562
It's the truth.

34:24.562 --> 34:26.030
Lord knows,
I have tried to deny it,

34:26.030 --> 34:28.331
tried to pretend
that I'm over you,

34:28.331 --> 34:30.034
but not a day
has gone by

34:30.034 --> 34:31.969
when I haven't thought of you--

34:31.969 --> 34:34.472
your smile, your beautiful eyes,

34:34.472 --> 34:36.940
what it would be like
to hold your hands

34:36.940 --> 34:39.744
and ask you the question
I never dared ask...

34:39.744 --> 34:41.512
What's the difference
between a blister and a boil?

34:41.512 --> 34:42.813
Donny!

34:44.415 --> 34:45.750
I took my shoe off,

34:45.750 --> 34:48.219
and it was like I'm growing
another anklebone down here.

34:48.219 --> 34:49.687
Doc, you went to med school.

34:49.687 --> 34:50.688
What am I supposed
to do with this?

34:50.688 --> 34:52.190
Lance it or something?

34:52.190 --> 34:53.623
You know,
as I recall

34:53.623 --> 34:55.693
the best thing
for that would be

34:55.693 --> 34:57.061
to soak it
in tepid water

34:57.061 --> 34:58.429
for at least half an hour.

34:58.429 --> 34:59.297
All right.
What luck, huh?

34:59.297 --> 35:01.666
Can you imagine a worse thing
could have happened to me

35:01.666 --> 35:04.435
the night before my wedding?

35:08.706 --> 35:09.974
I don't understand.

35:09.974 --> 35:12.410
How come you
never said anything before?

35:12.410 --> 35:13.845
Daphne, I wanted to.

35:13.845 --> 35:15.313
I just... the timing
never seemed right.

35:15.313 --> 35:17.248
Oh, and the timing's right now?

35:17.248 --> 35:20.518
I'm 12 hours from the altar
and you're on your honeymoon.

35:20.518 --> 35:21.819
I would never have
gotten married

35:21.819 --> 35:23.821
if I thought there was
the slightest chance

35:23.821 --> 35:24.789
that you shared my feelings.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.624
Trust me, Daphne,
say the word,

35:26.624 --> 35:28.993
and I will leave Mel
in a heartbeat.

35:28.993 --> 35:29.994
MEL:
Niles?

35:29.994 --> 35:30.995
Darling.

35:30.995 --> 35:32.997
I was just looking
over these brochures

35:32.997 --> 35:33.998
for our honeymoon.

35:33.998 --> 35:35.766
Hi, Daphne.
Hi.

35:35.766 --> 35:37.034
The Danieli has
a step-down tub,

35:37.034 --> 35:39.871
but the Gritti has
the most romantic view
of the Grand Canal.

35:39.871 --> 35:40.705
What do you think?

35:40.705 --> 35:42.006
I think a woman

35:42.006 --> 35:43.274
with your exquisite taste

35:43.274 --> 35:44.542
can handle this decision.

35:44.542 --> 35:45.810
He says that now.

35:45.810 --> 35:48.279
Wait till the
honeymoon's over.

35:51.015 --> 35:54.085
Don't the doors
in this bloody place lock?

35:54.085 --> 35:55.186
I'll get this one.
You get that one!

35:59.557 --> 36:02.927
Daphne, it is not
too late for us.

36:02.927 --> 36:05.163
I meant what I said
when I said I would leave her.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.030
That's crazy.

36:06.030 --> 36:07.431
No, no, it's
not crazy

36:07.431 --> 36:09.834
if you feel the same way I do.

36:09.834 --> 36:12.336
But I need you to tell me,

36:12.336 --> 36:15.640
and I can accept it
if the answer is no...

36:17.241 --> 36:19.310
how do you feel about me?

36:19.310 --> 36:20.545
(door opening)

36:20.545 --> 36:21.512
Pardon.
Simon?

36:21.512 --> 36:23.514
How could you get in here?

36:23.514 --> 36:26.017
Frasier loaned me his key,
in a manner of speaking.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.319
I have to get some things
out of the mini-bar.

36:28.319 --> 36:30.888
I don't want to get caught
empty-handed

36:30.888 --> 36:32.657
when last call comes.

36:34.926 --> 36:39.096
You're not having a last call
of your own in here, are you?

36:40.264 --> 36:41.632
Of course not.

36:41.632 --> 36:44.068
Right.

36:44.068 --> 36:46.537
This isn't the chap
whose baby you're having, is it?

36:46.537 --> 36:47.505
Excuse me?

36:47.505 --> 36:49.407
I'm not pregnant!

36:49.407 --> 36:50.741
Simon!

36:50.741 --> 36:52.076
Bit of bad news.

36:52.076 --> 36:52.910
Nigel!

36:52.910 --> 36:54.378
Peter's got sick
into the piano

36:54.378 --> 36:56.247
so we've been asked
to vacate the bar.

36:56.247 --> 36:57.615
Bloody hell, Daphne.

36:57.615 --> 36:59.450
Nice hotel you picked.

36:59.450 --> 37:00.284
Well, Nigel, I'm sure

37:00.284 --> 37:02.286
Daphne won't mind
we help ourselves

37:02.286 --> 37:04.155
to the contents of her mini-bar.
Away you go.

37:04.155 --> 37:05.456
Right. Give us
a hand, lads!

37:05.456 --> 37:06.324
Nigel!

37:06.324 --> 37:08.292
Stephen! Peter! David!
Michael! Billy!

37:08.793 --> 37:10.161
What are you all doing
in here?

37:10.161 --> 37:11.562
So here you all are.

37:11.562 --> 37:14.065
What is the point
of bringing the party

37:14.065 --> 37:15.399
down to the Winnebago

37:15.399 --> 37:17.568
when there's a perfectly
nice room right here?

37:17.568 --> 37:19.337
You're not moving
the party in here.

37:19.337 --> 37:20.238
Oh, Daphne,
don't get

37:20.238 --> 37:21.672
your blood pressure up.

37:21.672 --> 37:23.107
You've got your baby
to think of.

37:23.107 --> 37:24.442
Here, have a drink

37:24.442 --> 37:27.678
and relax... oh, God.

37:31.916 --> 37:34.952
I'm sorry
about all that.

37:34.952 --> 37:36.887
I must be in love.

37:36.887 --> 37:40.424
It doesn't even bother me
that you come with them.

37:43.394 --> 37:44.895
Lovely night, isn't it?

37:44.895 --> 37:45.896
Hmm.

37:45.896 --> 37:47.398
Stars are out.

37:47.398 --> 37:49.400
There's a nice breeze.

37:49.400 --> 37:50.735
(inhaling)

37:50.735 --> 37:54.071
Hmm?
Night-blooming jasmine.

37:54.071 --> 37:57.074
And of course,
there's the beautiful girl.

37:57.074 --> 38:00.077
Dr. Crane, I still haven't
answered your question.

38:00.077 --> 38:01.078
Yes, I know.

38:01.078 --> 38:03.547
That's why I keep talking.

38:03.547 --> 38:05.483
In case I don't get
the answer I want,

38:05.483 --> 38:06.984
I can at least make
this moment

38:06.984 --> 38:09.287
last a little longer.

38:13.090 --> 38:16.093
I'm not sure if it's jasmine
or orange blossoms.

38:16.093 --> 38:17.595
You know, a lot of times...

38:17.595 --> 38:19.430
Oh, for God's
sake, Dr. Crane.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.647
I think you
can call me Niles now.

38:47.058 --> 38:48.559
No.

38:48.559 --> 38:51.562
I don't think I can.

38:51.562 --> 38:55.933
I do love you, but
I can't do this.

38:55.933 --> 38:58.302
W-w-well, I know it'll
be difficult, b-but...

38:58.302 --> 38:59.804
I will get a divorce,

38:59.804 --> 39:01.305
and you can call off
the wedding.

39:01.305 --> 39:02.807
I can't.

39:02.807 --> 39:05.309
Donny is a dear
and wonderful man,

39:05.309 --> 39:07.745
and I made a
promise to him.

39:07.745 --> 39:11.482
And, Mel-- you made more
than a promise to her.

39:11.482 --> 39:13.784
We were supposed to forget that?

39:13.784 --> 39:17.321
For what? We have no idea
how we'd be together.

39:17.321 --> 39:20.758
For heaven's sakes,
we've never even been on a date.

39:22.226 --> 39:24.729
Daphne, take it
from someone who knows.

39:24.729 --> 39:26.230
You don't want to spend
half your life

39:26.230 --> 39:29.533
thinking about a chance
you didn't take.

39:29.533 --> 39:31.802
I'm sorry.

39:31.802 --> 39:33.804
My mind's made up.

39:36.307 --> 39:40.311
I think we should
say good night now.

39:47.485 --> 39:49.420
Good night, Daphne.

39:51.322 --> 39:53.657
Good night, Dr. Crane.

40:10.274 --> 40:11.742
Hey, Niles.

40:11.742 --> 40:14.745
Don't tell me the
ceremony's over already.

40:14.745 --> 40:16.747
Oh, no, it hasn't
even started yet.

40:16.747 --> 40:18.249
Actually, we saw you
heading over this way.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.251
We thought maybe you
could use some company.

40:20.251 --> 40:21.252
I just felt like
some privacy.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.620
This is one wedding

40:22.620 --> 40:25.322
I couldn't see myself
handling very well.

40:25.322 --> 40:27.425
Oh, lots of people
cry at weddings.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.692
Yeah, but not so many end up

40:28.692 --> 40:30.594
wailing
and rending their garments.

40:30.594 --> 40:31.962
I appreciate
your coming over,

40:31.962 --> 40:34.932
but I'd hate for you
to miss it on my account.

40:34.932 --> 40:36.400
Actually,
it's been delayed a bit.

40:36.400 --> 40:37.902
You see, the justice
of the peace started out

40:37.902 --> 40:39.737
asking the witnesses
to step forward,

40:39.737 --> 40:42.440
and three of Daphne's brothers
just ran off into the woods.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.808
(knocking)

40:43.808 --> 40:45.309
Ah.

40:46.710 --> 40:48.679
Hello.
Here's your wine, sir.

40:48.679 --> 40:50.681
Yes. Thank you very
much, young man.

40:50.681 --> 40:52.950
Uh, and, uh,
this is for you.

40:52.950 --> 40:53.818
What is this?

40:53.818 --> 40:55.719
Well, Niles,
I got to thinking

40:55.719 --> 40:58.155
about our old friend Morrie

40:58.155 --> 41:01.659
and how he kept this bottle
of wine his entire life

41:01.659 --> 41:04.161
waiting for a special occasion.

41:04.161 --> 41:05.663
And then, I thought

41:05.663 --> 41:07.531
what occasion
am I saving it for?

41:07.531 --> 41:09.867
And then I thought
about what a courageous thing

41:09.867 --> 41:10.868
you did last night--

41:10.868 --> 41:14.205
taking that chance.

41:14.205 --> 41:16.373
And that's worth a toast.

41:16.373 --> 41:17.241
No, no, Frasier...

41:17.241 --> 41:18.509
Niles,
it's too late.

41:18.509 --> 41:19.777
The foil is pierced.

41:19.777 --> 41:21.779
I know this thing
between you and Mel

41:21.779 --> 41:24.281
seems kind of bad
right now, but...

41:24.281 --> 41:26.150
Oh, now, Dad, why
do you say that?

41:26.150 --> 41:28.018
Just because I spent
the third night of my marriage

41:28.018 --> 41:30.521
proposing to another woman?

41:30.521 --> 41:31.989
Well, I'm just saying

41:31.989 --> 41:33.491
that marriages survive
all kinds of stuff.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.493
You know, you
might still be happy.

41:35.493 --> 41:38.295
Ten years from now, this
could all be ancient history.

41:38.295 --> 41:40.397
I hope you're right.

41:40.397 --> 41:42.132
FRASIER:
All right, gentlemen.

41:42.132 --> 41:44.535
Here we are.

41:44.535 --> 41:48.038
Dad, Niles-- allow me.

41:48.539 --> 41:50.808
To better days.

42:05.689 --> 42:07.758
Dad, where did Morrie keep this?

42:07.758 --> 42:08.993
In his wine rack.

42:08.993 --> 42:10.027
Which is?

42:10.027 --> 42:11.529
In the boiler room.
Oh, Lord.

42:11.529 --> 42:14.532
I'll just save this little treat
for later.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.001
Yes, well, thanks
for the thought.

42:17.001 --> 42:19.436
You two should be running along.
I'll be fine.

42:19.436 --> 42:21.205
All right, well,
take care, Niles.

42:21.205 --> 42:22.373
FRASIER:
I saw a waiter

42:22.373 --> 42:23.741
passing champagne just outside.

42:24.241 --> 42:26.243
I'll have him bring you
a glass, so you can...

42:26.243 --> 42:29.547
Get the taste out.
Yes, thank you, Frasier.

42:42.092 --> 42:44.094
(knocking)

42:44.094 --> 42:44.995
Come in.

42:44.995 --> 42:47.831
Hello.

42:47.831 --> 42:50.701
Daphne.

42:50.701 --> 42:52.069
I was wondering...

42:52.069 --> 42:54.905
if you might be free for a date.

42:56.140 --> 42:58.075
Oh, my God, yes.

42:59.043 --> 43:01.078
There's plenty of time
for that later.

43:01.078 --> 43:02.947
Let's get
this bloody boat moving.

43:02.947 --> 43:05.449
What... you mean now?

43:05.449 --> 43:07.451
There's about
a hundred people back there

43:07.451 --> 43:08.953
I'm not so keen on seeing.

43:08.953 --> 43:10.454
All right.

43:10.454 --> 43:12.790
Let's go then.

43:12.790 --> 43:15.693
Fasten your seat belt, Daphne.

43:15.693 --> 43:18.028
Fasten yours, Niles.

43:26.470 --> 43:28.539
# Hey, baby,
I hear the blues a'callin' #

43:28.539 --> 43:31.542
# Tossed salads
and scrambled eggs #

43:31.542 --> 43:33.544
# Oh, my #

43:33.544 --> 43:35.546
# And maybe
I seem a bit confused #

43:35.546 --> 43:38.515
# Well, maybe,
but I got you pegged #

43:38.515 --> 43:40.484
(laughing)

43:40.484 --> 43:42.052
# But I don't know what to do #

43:42.486 --> 43:46.557
# With those tossed salads
and scrambled eggs #

43:46.557 --> 43:49.059
# They're callin' again. #

43:49.059 --> 43:50.561
Good night, Seattle!

43:50.561 --> 43:52.730
We love you!
