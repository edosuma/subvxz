01:13.552 --> 01:17.339
MAN:
Give us your tired, your poor,

01:17.340 --> 01:22.143
your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free...

01:22.144 --> 01:24.496
and looking for
a government handout,

01:24.497 --> 01:27.499
a free lunch
and a dental plan too...

01:27.500 --> 01:31.185
the wretched refuse
of your teeming shore,

01:31.186 --> 01:33.622
your unwashed yellows
and browns

01:33.623 --> 01:35.624
and all colors
in between,

01:35.625 --> 01:39.276
Jews and gentiles,
Muslims and Hindus

01:39.277 --> 01:42.897
and anyone else
with funny hats,

01:42.898 --> 01:45.433
and we will make fun
of them.

01:49.505 --> 01:52.424
And now
the white ladies.

01:55.294 --> 01:58.296
Gosh, Nancy, I just
don't know what to do.

01:58.297 --> 02:00.264
What's the matter, Sue?

02:00.265 --> 02:02.667
Last week a man moved
into the house next door,

02:02.668 --> 02:05.703
and he's African-American.
But when we were introduced,

02:05.704 --> 02:08.939
I wasn't overcome with feelings
of rage or animal fear.

02:08.940 --> 02:12.327
Gee, sue, sounds like you've met
a non-threatening black man.

02:12.328 --> 02:14.695
A non-threatening black man?
What's that?

02:14.696 --> 02:16.380
A male negro
who fails to trigger

02:16.381 --> 02:19.233
the customary fight-or-flight
response in Caucasian women

02:19.234 --> 02:22.403
due to his nonspecific physical
and socio-cultural attributes,

02:22.404 --> 02:24.722
like Al Roker
or Bryant Gumbel.

02:24.723 --> 02:28.426
But if he's a non-threatening black
man, why isn't he a newscaster?

02:28.427 --> 02:32.013
Oh, Sue, not every non-threatening
black man is a newscaster.

02:32.014 --> 02:34.615
Some of them work in
advertising and politics.

02:34.616 --> 02:35.917
Is that allowed?

02:35.918 --> 02:37.202
In some states.

02:37.203 --> 02:39.470
Gosh, this is all
so confusing.

02:39.471 --> 02:40.939
What should I do?

02:40.940 --> 02:43.024
Move. He may be
non-threatening to you,

02:43.025 --> 02:45.176
but your property values
won't know the difference.

02:45.177 --> 02:48.746
You're right. I'll go home and
start packing right away.

02:48.747 --> 02:51.048
But what'll
I tell the kids?

02:51.049 --> 02:53.901
Tell them to fear people
who are different.

02:53.902 --> 02:56.154

yourself like a good little boy

a question?

06:46.252 --> 06:48.986

live," your comedy central,

06:48.987 --> 06:51.856
it was your guys' name
synonymous with funny.

Well, this is
how you get it back.

to the funny.

07:03.068 --> 07:05.185
- Just jokes?
- Dirty jokes.

You want to make an entire
movie out of just dirty jokes?

07:07.439 --> 07:08.873
- You got it.
- Just one after another?

07:08.874 --> 07:11.092
- That's right.
- But that's not a movie.

07:11.093 --> 07:12.543
I could be.
Look at "the aristocrats."

07:12.544 --> 07:14.645
"The aristocrats"
got a lot of heat.

07:14.646 --> 07:16.764
Maybe we should do
something like that.

07:16.765 --> 07:19.601
Yeah, but "the aristocrats"
is a movie about a joke.

07:19.602 --> 07:20.885
Right, so this will be
even better.

07:20.886 --> 07:25.289
What if we did a 90-minute
live-action "aristocrats"?

07:25.290 --> 07:26.807
I love it.
It pops.

07:26.808 --> 07:28.776
Did you actually see
"the aristocrats"?

07:28.777 --> 07:31.145
- No.
- It's a joke about a family

07:31.146 --> 07:34.849
that sodomizes their children and
defecates all over each other.

07:34.850 --> 07:36.634
You think it's not
a good idea?

while her husband

07:38.754 --> 07:41.122
is humping their golden
retriever in the ass?

07:41.123 --> 07:42.940
How would we even
shoot that?

07:42.941 --> 07:46.527
- Do a lot of it in editing.
- Sure, stock footage.

07:46.528 --> 07:48.529
Okay, so how are
we gonna film a guy

07:48.530 --> 07:50.331

his daughter's mouth?

07:50.332 --> 07:51.615

07:51.616 --> 07:53.351
Well, we're still
gonna need a star.

07:53.352 --> 07:55.220
Real or C.G.I.?

07:55.221 --> 07:58.406
'Cause what star is gonna shit
in a little girl's mouth?

08:02.994 --> 08:04.612
It would prove
he's not gay.

08:04.613 --> 08:06.380
He's not gonna
do that on camera.

08:06.381 --> 08:08.115
He doesn't work
with animals anyway.

08:08.116 --> 08:11.285
True true.
Forget it. No "aristocrats."

08:11.286 --> 08:14.405
But I'm not sure
that a dirty-joke movie

08:14.406 --> 08:17.842
is sending our brand in the direction
I think we should be heading.

08:17.843 --> 08:21.695
Are we talking about sick,
mind-numbing depravity,

08:21.696 --> 08:24.666
gratuitous nudity
and cheap sex?

08:24.667 --> 08:25.967
If we do it right.

08:25.968 --> 08:29.403
Look, tits alone aren't
gonna do it anymore.

is box-office gold.

So you get tits with jokes...
we're rolling.

08:36.745 --> 08:39.230

jokes, blonde jokes?

08:39.231 --> 08:40.748
Midget jokes,
dead baby jokes.

08:40.749 --> 08:43.034
No no no no no,
no dead baby jokes.

08:43.034 --> 08:44.752
Okay, maybe
no dead baby jokes.

08:44.753 --> 08:46.504
What about
racist jokes?

08:46.505 --> 08:48.872
Oh, that could get
a little touchy.

08:48.873 --> 08:51.409
- There's a way to do it.
- How?

08:51.410 --> 08:54.028
A racist joke's
only racist

08:54.029 --> 08:55.863
depending on
who's telling it.

08:55.864 --> 08:58.932

to tell the racist joke.

with the word nig...

No way, huh-uh.
It's out of the question.

in public, you know what they do?

09:18.837 --> 09:21.606

And I am not going back to rehab.

- Come on.
- No, he's right.

bridge too far even for us.

says to her, "give me
five shots of whisky."

lays them down on the bar,

starts pouring...
one, two, three, four, five.

as fast as he can.

So how have you been?

23:59.600 --> 24:01.835
I'm sorry,
do I know you?

24:01.836 --> 24:04.471
Yes, you're the father
of one of my children.

24:04.472 --> 24:06.923
Oh my God.

24:06.924 --> 24:09.726
You're the stripper that I
fucked at my bachelor party

24:09.727 --> 24:11.561
while your friend
spanked me

24:11.562 --> 24:13.830
and shoved
a cucumber up my ass.

24:13.831 --> 24:17.284
No, I'm your son's
English teacher.

24:19.337 --> 24:21.321
How's your yorkie?

24:22.273 --> 24:25.142
Hold on. I just
wrote this one down.

24:25.143 --> 24:27.994
How many Polacks
does it take

24:27.995 --> 24:30.163
- to screw in...
(MUZAK PLAYING)

24:30.164 --> 24:32.032
(CHUCKLES)
Funny.

24:32.033 --> 24:34.001
All righty,
now what was it?

24:34.002 --> 24:37.654
I don't think you got what I was
saying in the script notes.

24:38.506 --> 24:40.674
What were you saying?

24:40.675 --> 24:43.844
What I was saying is
that if we just have

24:43.845 --> 24:45.879
nothing but jokes
one after another,

24:45.880 --> 24:48.348
there's no story.

24:48.349 --> 24:50.200
Which of these
is funnier?

24:50.201 --> 24:52.202
- I don't care.
- Fair enough.

24:52.203 --> 24:54.137
What I was saying is
that I don't think

24:54.138 --> 24:56.223
anyone's gonna sit
through this entire movie

24:56.224 --> 24:58.558
without a story.

24:58.559 --> 24:59.892
That's all I'm saying.

24:59.893 --> 25:01.677
So what are you saying?

25:01.678 --> 25:03.780
We have to find a narrative...

25:03.781 --> 25:06.416
a beginning, a middle

25:06.417 --> 25:08.418
and an end.

25:08.419 --> 25:10.987
So what if we take

25:10.988 --> 25:13.240
all the characters
from the jokes...

25:13.241 --> 25:15.325
the main characters
like the dumb blonde,

25:15.326 --> 25:17.327
little Johnny,
the pedophile priest...

25:17.328 --> 25:19.529
and we give them
a backstory?

25:21.498 --> 25:23.916
Like what's-my-motivation
kind of shit?

25:23.917 --> 25:27.420
Yeah, like maybe little Johnny
spent some time in foster care.

25:27.421 --> 25:30.524
Or the dumb blonde used to be a
guy, and now she's gender-confused.

25:30.525 --> 25:32.442
- Maybe.
- Fuck no! They're jokes...

25:32.443 --> 25:34.660
setup, punch line, onto the next one.
Come on.

25:34.661 --> 25:36.429
Look, even in
a porno film

25:36.430 --> 25:38.832
the guy shows up
with the pizza.

25:38.833 --> 25:41.034
We know the girl
has ordered the pizza.

25:41.035 --> 25:44.203
We know he is there
to deliver the pizza.

25:44.204 --> 25:47.357
There is a story.

25:47.358 --> 25:49.793
So you want the priest
to deliver a pizza?

25:49.794 --> 25:51.194
(RECORD SCRATCHES)

25:53.947 --> 25:55.398
I'm confused.

25:55.399 --> 25:57.016
You know what?
Forget it.

25:57.017 --> 25:59.135
- I guess a priest could deliver a pizza.
- Never mind.

25:59.136 --> 26:00.587
Or a rabbi comes
to fix the cable.

26:00.588 --> 26:02.922
- Forget I even brought it up.
- Suit yourself.

26:02.923 --> 26:04.657
Other button.

26:04.658 --> 26:06.510
Good boy.

26:15.536 --> 26:17.504
A blue-ball joke.

26:19.073 --> 26:21.074
Mr. Siguera.

26:21.075 --> 26:23.076
Yeah, how is she, doc?

26:23.077 --> 26:25.578
I have good news
and I have bad news.

26:25.579 --> 26:27.980
And the bad news is the
accident was very severe.

26:27.981 --> 26:29.982
She has
a ruptured esophagus,

26:29.983 --> 26:32.285
so you're gonna have to feed
her through a tube daily.

26:32.286 --> 26:34.671
- Okay.
- We had to amputate both her arms,

26:34.672 --> 26:36.673
so you're gonna have to
help her in the bathroom

26:36.674 --> 26:39.369
and pretty much wipe her ass
for the rest of her life.

26:39.395 --> 26:40.043
Oh God.

26:40.044 --> 26:43.029
There's gonna be a white milky
discharge coming from her vagina.

26:43.030 --> 26:45.882
Don't worry.
It's normal but very pungent.

26:45.883 --> 26:48.685
So make sure that you change her
diaper every three to four hours.

26:48.686 --> 26:51.571
Oh God.
What's the good news?

26:53.073 --> 26:56.159
I'm just kidding.
She's dead.

27:01.849 --> 27:04.551
Hey, babe, you wanna fuck?

27:04.552 --> 27:08.238
Oh, I have a gynecologist
appointment in the morning.

27:08.239 --> 27:10.207
I can't.

27:19.533 --> 27:21.635
Do you have a dentist appointment?

27:23.003 --> 27:26.223
So there we were
in Africa on safari

27:26.224 --> 27:29.860
tracking a giant
man-eating lion for days.

27:29.861 --> 27:31.995
Finally we made camp.

27:31.996 --> 27:33.846
And that night,

27:33.847 --> 27:35.848
just as I was
falling asleep,

27:35.849 --> 27:38.735
the lion tore into
my tent and roared...

27:38.736 --> 27:42.371
rr-arrgh!

27:42.372 --> 27:46.776
I shit in my pants.

27:46.777 --> 27:50.113
Oh. Well, that's okay.
If there was a lion in my tent,

27:50.114 --> 27:51.647
I would have shit
my pants too.

27:51.648 --> 27:55.651
No, not then. Just now
when I went "rarr-gh!"

27:55.652 --> 27:57.954
I shit in my pants.

28:02.627 --> 28:04.628
Did you hear about
the Polish girl

28:04.629 --> 28:06.630
who dropped her gum
in the toilet?

28:06.631 --> 28:08.632
She chewed the shit
out of it.

28:44.084 --> 28:46.419
making a movie,
having an audition.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.988
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you call the actors?

28:48.989 --> 28:50.506
The casting director
does that.

28:50.507 --> 28:52.675
Right right.

28:52.676 --> 28:55.361
Having an open call,

28:55.362 --> 28:58.231
a cattle call,
as they say.

28:58.232 --> 29:00.300
Come in,
the first actor!

29:02.586 --> 29:04.604
Give it to me.

What's the difference
between a pussy and a cunt?

29:08.359 --> 29:10.677

29:10.678 --> 29:12.245
and feels awesome
on your cock,

29:12.246 --> 29:14.164
and a cunt's the bitch
that owns it.

through all this shit?"

wife is really dead?

dishes start piling up.

flowing from you,

letting it go.

now let it flow.

a gin guy, huh?

33:02.292 --> 33:04.293
I hate that shit.

33:04.294 --> 33:07.096
I drank a whole fifth of gin
last night and blew chunks.

33:07.097 --> 33:09.432
Oh buddy, you drink
a fifth of anything...

33:09.433 --> 33:10.833
you're bound
to blow chunks.

33:10.834 --> 33:13.319
No, you don't understand.

33:13.320 --> 33:14.987
Chunks is my dog.

his gym shorts?

gym shorts.

These are girls' gym shorts.

No, they're not. It's a
pair of boy' gym shorts.

33:27.568 --> 33:28.901
Look, I've been doing this
for a long time.

33:28.902 --> 33:30.603
I know a pair of girls'
gym shorts when I see 'em.

33:30.604 --> 33:32.572
Well, then you know that
those are boys' gym shorts.

33:32.573 --> 33:34.174
- You're wrong.
- Oh please, you're wrong.

33:34.175 --> 33:35.508
Look, these are
girls' gym shorts.

33:35.509 --> 33:37.076
It's a pair of
boys' gym shorts.

Hey hey hey,
what's the problem here?

33:39.079 --> 33:42.215

notice for boys' gym shorts,

10 bodies.

that autopsy report

34:10.543 --> 34:12.411

fished out of the river?

34:12.413 --> 34:14.347
Yeah, blunt force
followed by asphyxiation.

34:14.348 --> 34:17.183
Three days floating in the
Hudson didn't help either.

her clitoris...

Okay okay,
how about this one?

to drop by for a cold one.

that marker.

do gay necrophilia jokes.

gender preference

35:08.184 --> 35:10.285
any kind of factor
in fucking a corpse?

35:10.286 --> 35:12.622
You say that like it's
from personal experience.

35:12.623 --> 35:15.191
No, it's just that...

you don't like
gay jokes, do you?

35:17.227 --> 35:19.495
No, I...

35:19.496 --> 35:22.631
gay jokes are fine.
I... I like gay jokes.

35:22.632 --> 35:24.933
What are you
talking about?

35:24.934 --> 35:27.109
How can you tell if
you're at a gay picnic?

35:27.135 --> 35:27.653
How?

35:27.654 --> 35:29.772
- All the hot dogs taste like shit.
- Ha!

35:29.773 --> 35:32.875
That's not funny. I don't have a problem.
It's just not funny.

35:32.876 --> 35:34.043
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

35:34.044 --> 35:35.444
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

35:35.445 --> 35:37.497
- You're gay, aren't you?
- No, I'm n...

35:37.498 --> 35:40.149
I've got a wife
and three kids.

35:40.150 --> 35:42.652
Fine.

35:42.653 --> 35:45.004
No gay jokes.

35:45.005 --> 35:47.273
It's cool.

35:47.274 --> 35:49.708
I guess no Puerto Rican
jokes either.

35:49.709 --> 35:52.711
Puerto Rican?
I'm Jewish.

36:02.105 --> 36:04.357
Wait, hold on, hold on,
I got one.

36:04.358 --> 36:08.194
What do you call an open can
of tuna in a dyke's apartment?

36:08.195 --> 36:10.429
Potpourri.

36:10.430 --> 36:14.150
See, now that's funny.
That is funny.

36:14.151 --> 36:17.419
So we can make fun of
the carpet munchers but...

36:17.420 --> 36:20.790
it's cool.
I get it.

36:20.791 --> 36:22.792
- Get what?
- Nothing.

36:22.793 --> 36:25.845
That is a fabulous belt
you're wearing, by the way.

36:25.846 --> 36:28.580
Oh, thank you...
I know what you're doing.

36:34.988 --> 36:37.623
Dad, I think
my gym teacher's gay.

36:37.624 --> 36:39.125
Oh?

36:39.126 --> 36:40.876
Why do you say that?

36:40.877 --> 36:43.595
Because he closes his eyes
when I kiss him.

36:47.117 --> 36:49.485
I was so sorry to hear
about your wife.

36:49.486 --> 36:50.954
We were all
praying for her.

36:50.955 --> 36:52.488
Thanks.
Thanks so much.

36:52.489 --> 36:54.207
At least she's not
suffering anymore.

36:54.208 --> 36:56.291
She was in that coma
for so long.

36:56.292 --> 36:57.961
I know.

36:57.962 --> 37:00.797
Just when we thought
she might pull out of it...

37:00.798 --> 37:02.331
really?

37:02.332 --> 37:04.734
They did everything
they could do.

37:04.735 --> 37:06.736
And then
the doctor said

37:06.737 --> 37:08.738
some pleasurable
stimulation

37:08.739 --> 37:11.507
might bring her out
of her coma.

37:11.508 --> 37:14.243
He asked if she liked
oral sex.

37:14.244 --> 37:17.146
Boy, did she.

37:17.147 --> 37:19.148
So he said

37:19.149 --> 37:22.118
some really vigorous
oral action

37:22.119 --> 37:24.253
might take her out
of her coma.

37:24.254 --> 37:26.255
So I tried it.

37:26.256 --> 37:28.091
What happened?

37:28.092 --> 37:31.861
I don't know.
I think she choked.

37:31.862 --> 37:34.330
Oh God,
I'm so ashamed, man.

37:34.331 --> 37:36.599
I know I'm going to hell
for the things I've done.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.684
- Oh? What have you done?
- Fucked people's pets.

37:38.685 --> 37:41.437
Oh, that'll get you in.
You are going straight to hell.

37:41.438 --> 37:44.607
- How would you know?
- I'm getting my theology degree.

37:44.608 --> 37:47.343
- Really? Where?
- Online.

37:47.344 --> 37:49.345
So what do they say
about hell?

37:49.346 --> 37:52.047
Well, it's really not so bad.
Do you like to get high?

37:52.048 --> 37:54.333
- Love it.
- Well, you're gonna love Mondays.

37:54.334 --> 37:56.602
On Mondays
it's 420 all the time.

37:56.603 --> 37:59.405
You can get as high as you want.
You can do as much drugs as you want.

37:59.406 --> 38:01.674
You won't overdose 'cause
you're already dead.

38:01.700 --> 38:02.241
Sweet.

38:02.242 --> 38:03.909
- Do you like to gamble?
- You bet.

38:03.910 --> 38:05.477
Well, you will
love Tuesdays,

38:05.478 --> 38:07.479
'cause you can gamble all you
want and lose all your money.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.248
'Cause you don't need money
in the afterlife.

38:09.249 --> 38:11.150
No alimony.

38:11.151 --> 38:13.486
- And are you gay?
- Fuck no, I'm not gay.

38:13.487 --> 38:16.422
Then you won't like
Wednesdays.

38:20.861 --> 38:23.529
I love you, man.

38:23.530 --> 38:25.331

so much.

love you that much.

I wouldn't drink.

fucking divorce me.

It was a package deal.

- Oh, gotta have a midget.

need that midget?

on my shirt

you have terminal cancer.

- Oh my God.
- It metastasized through your system

we can do.

like him?

Look, we all agreed the only
safe way to tell a black joke

41:26.379 --> 41:28.064
is to have
a black person tell it.

41:28.065 --> 41:29.698
And?

41:29.699 --> 41:32.734
Well, we couldn't find a black
person willing to do that.

Yeah, it's called
self-respect.

telling the jokes.

he's wearing a hood.

46:19.806 --> 46:23.075
(LAUGHS) He's right.
It's not dead.

46:23.076 --> 46:25.277
I don't want to hear it!
I don't want to know!

46:25.278 --> 46:28.146
- I don't want to hear it!
- But it's really funny.

46:28.147 --> 46:30.666
I don't care.
We are filming this.

46:30.667 --> 46:32.751
How are you gonna film
a dead baby joke?

46:32.752 --> 46:34.620
A stunt baby?

46:36.055 --> 46:38.574
You just don't
understand funny.

46:38.575 --> 46:40.659
Dead baby jokes
are not funny.

46:40.660 --> 46:42.544
- But it's not dead.
- Drop it!

46:43.979 --> 46:46.966
It's not
a dead baby joke.

46:46.967 --> 46:48.867
I heard that.

46:51.804 --> 46:54.106
You really think a baby
could survive that?

46:55.725 --> 46:57.843
So I told her,
"ass, gas or grass, bitch.

46:57.844 --> 46:59.845
Nobody rides for free."

46:59.846 --> 47:02.113
Hey, Brian.

47:02.114 --> 47:03.182
Do I know you?

47:03.183 --> 47:06.268
Um, it's Blair,
remember?

47:06.269 --> 47:08.504
I met you here
at the toga party.

47:08.505 --> 47:11.590
We went up to your
room, remember?

47:11.591 --> 47:14.276
You told me
I was a good sport.

47:14.277 --> 47:17.045
Hey, Blair baby,
how are you doing?

47:17.046 --> 47:19.314
Well, I'm pregnant...

47:19.315 --> 47:21.182
Oh shit.

47:21.183 --> 47:23.485
...and I think
I'm gonna kill myself.

47:23.486 --> 47:26.004
Wow, you really are
a good sport.

47:30.477 --> 47:32.478
May I ask you
a question?

47:32.479 --> 47:34.480
Sure.

47:34.481 --> 47:36.715
If you woke up in the
middle of the woods

47:36.716 --> 47:38.801
with your pants
around your ankles

47:38.802 --> 47:42.304
and vaseline smeared
all over your ass,

47:42.305 --> 47:44.222
would you
tell anyone?

47:44.223 --> 47:45.674
Fuck no.

47:45.675 --> 47:47.692
Really?

47:47.693 --> 47:50.011
Would you like
to go camping?

47:53.149 --> 47:56.751
What's the difference
between erotic and kinky?

47:56.752 --> 47:58.770
Erotic...
you use a feather.

47:58.771 --> 48:01.556
Kinky... you use
the whole chicken.

48:04.794 --> 48:06.412
You see, honey,

48:06.413 --> 48:09.465
this is the pig that I fuck
when you have a headache.

48:09.466 --> 48:11.667
You idiot,

48:11.668 --> 48:14.887
that's a chicken,
not a pig.

48:14.888 --> 48:17.088
I wasn't
talking to you.

48:18.140 --> 48:19.308
(KISSES)

48:22.211 --> 48:24.446
What the fuck? What do you
mean, you have no money?

48:24.447 --> 48:26.948
I got the board
to sign off on this.

48:26.949 --> 48:29.868
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's my
guy with the jerk-off emporium.

48:29.869 --> 48:32.371
He's having some
liquidity issues.

48:32.372 --> 48:33.906
What the hell
does that mean?

48:33.907 --> 48:35.573
He's been sent
to federal prison.

48:35.574 --> 48:37.375
Oh Jesus.

48:37.376 --> 48:39.328
Prostitution?

48:39.329 --> 48:40.812
Actually no.
It turns out

48:40.813 --> 48:43.214
his jerk-off booths weren't
handicapped-accessible.

48:43.215 --> 48:46.050
What the fuck?
I can't get in here.

48:46.051 --> 48:48.052
The supreme court ruling
came down yesterday...

48:48.053 --> 48:49.905
"Harrison vs. Ladyfingers."

48:49.906 --> 48:51.790
A five-to-four ruling.

48:51.791 --> 48:53.942
Clarence Thomas was
the deciding vote.

48:53.943 --> 48:55.693
Go figure.

48:55.694 --> 48:57.479
Well, where does
that leave us?

48:57.480 --> 49:00.132
We always got
plan B.

49:00.133 --> 49:02.801
It's not the lowest
we've sunk.

49:02.802 --> 49:04.202
Okay, Morty,
thanks for dropping by.

49:04.203 --> 49:06.271
Thanks for the news.
Get out of here. We'll call.

49:06.272 --> 49:08.573
Okay, I can fix it with the jerk-off king.
I just need a day or two.

49:08.574 --> 49:10.108
CHARLIE: We're fine.
I'll call you. I'll call you.

49:10.109 --> 49:12.027
Can I talk to you guys
for a second?

49:12.028 --> 49:13.739
We're kind of in the
middle of something, pal.

49:13.765 --> 49:14.613
It's pretty urgent.

49:14.614 --> 49:17.416
I've been doing the projections and we don't
have enough money to finish the shoot.

49:17.417 --> 49:19.384
How bad is it?

49:27.610 --> 49:31.129
For starters, we have to
pull all the midget jokes.

49:31.130 --> 49:33.031
You fucking asshole.

49:33.032 --> 49:34.232
Ah.

49:34.233 --> 49:35.701
Fucking asshole.

49:35.702 --> 49:37.402
You little
punch fucker.

49:37.403 --> 49:39.655
Eh, they're uppity.
We don't need their attitude.

49:39.656 --> 49:43.441
I loved that midget.

49:43.442 --> 49:45.410
You fucked her.

49:47.546 --> 49:49.614
Losing the midget is
gonna hurt us overseas.

49:49.615 --> 49:52.968
What do you need?
Without the midget.

49:52.969 --> 49:56.271
I'm gonna need
an extra $217.

49:56.272 --> 49:58.140
(BOTH LAUGH)

49:58.141 --> 50:00.142
Well...

50:00.143 --> 50:01.910
That's not
gonna happen.

50:01.911 --> 50:04.646
It's gotta happen.
I've cut every corner possible.

50:04.647 --> 50:07.132
And all the sets are starting
to look vaguely familiar.

50:07.133 --> 50:08.350
Stop worrying.

50:08.351 --> 50:10.285
We thought
this might come up.

50:10.286 --> 50:11.302
What's this?

50:11.303 --> 50:12.988
- Plan B.
- Market research.

50:12.989 --> 50:14.522
- What for?
- To sell commercials.

50:14.523 --> 50:17.092
- Commercials?
- Commercials.

50:17.093 --> 50:18.726
- You want to sell commercials?
- Yeah.

50:18.727 --> 50:20.512
- In a movie?
- Never been done.

50:20.513 --> 50:23.598
Well, don't you think there's
a good reason for that?

50:23.599 --> 50:26.685
Oh, they're not commercials
exactly, more like sponsorships.

50:26.686 --> 50:28.920
You take the most
expensive jokes

50:28.921 --> 50:31.690
and you have them underwritten
by a corporate sponsor,

50:31.691 --> 50:34.459
- like...
- BOTH: P.B.S.

50:34.460 --> 50:36.311
Right, so for instance

50:36.312 --> 50:39.214
"this evening's violent
gay butt-rape joke

50:39.215 --> 50:42.651
will be brought to you by the American
musical theater association."

50:42.652 --> 50:43.818
- You got it.
- Exactly.

50:43.819 --> 50:45.687
Yeah well,
while you're at it,

50:45.688 --> 50:48.857
all your black jokes can be
paid for with malt liquor ads.

50:48.858 --> 50:51.143
Actually, that's what
the market research says.

50:51.144 --> 50:53.962
I was kidding.
I have to be careful, you know.

50:53.963 --> 50:55.947
Some of my best friends
are black.

50:58.584 --> 51:00.685
Okay, you're right.
They're not.

51:00.686 --> 51:02.487
It'll be fine.

51:02.488 --> 51:04.506
The commercials
will be done tastefully.

51:04.507 --> 51:08.326
Seamlessly. The audience won't
even know it's happening.

51:08.327 --> 51:10.028
(RECORD SCRATCHES)

51:10.029 --> 51:12.731
MAN: When I was a
boy, growing up here

51:12.732 --> 51:15.334
in the smoky mountains
of Tennessee,

51:15.335 --> 51:18.503
my grandpa used to take me
trout fishing.

51:18.504 --> 51:21.005
And every fishing trip
we'd take,

51:21.006 --> 51:23.275
he'd be sure
to bring along

51:23.276 --> 51:26.578
a can
of little Vienna sausages.

51:26.579 --> 51:29.548
'Cause
little Vienna sausages

51:29.549 --> 51:32.284
are more than just
artificial gelatin

51:32.285 --> 51:34.686
and leftover
cattle feces.

51:34.687 --> 51:37.122
They're a part
of growing up.

51:37.123 --> 51:39.124
Around lunchtime

51:39.125 --> 51:41.126
I'd go digging
in his rucksack

51:41.127 --> 51:43.595
and I'd eat up
the whole can.

51:43.596 --> 51:46.064
Boy, it'd give me
the shits

51:46.065 --> 51:47.833
something terrible.

51:47.834 --> 51:51.036
I guess I was just too
young to know better.

51:51.037 --> 51:53.838
And grandpa...
well, by that point

51:53.839 --> 51:56.558
he was just too drunk
to care.

51:56.559 --> 51:59.494
We never did catch
many fish,

51:59.495 --> 52:03.164
but it didn't matter
so much.

52:03.165 --> 52:06.200
Thanks to my
little Vienna sausages,

52:06.201 --> 52:09.137
I'd usually be stuck
on the toilet

52:09.138 --> 52:13.341
by the time grandpa started
ranting about communism

52:13.342 --> 52:16.627
and beating his woman.

52:16.628 --> 52:18.580
Little Vienna sausages.

52:18.581 --> 52:22.251
Just a little taste
of America.

52:28.558 --> 52:30.642
I'm telling you,
my guy's gonna come through.

52:30.643 --> 52:32.744
Morty, look, little Vienna
sausages came through.

52:32.745 --> 52:34.980
Between the commercials and
product placements, we're fine.

52:34.981 --> 52:36.715
- So I can take the whole box?
- Please.

52:36.716 --> 52:39.517
Look who's living large. So what are
you gonna do with all this money?

52:39.518 --> 52:41.452
Are you gonna get a big
movie star for your movie?

52:41.453 --> 52:42.954
I hear Rod Steiger's
out of work.

52:42.955 --> 52:44.288
Rod Steiger's dead.

52:44.289 --> 52:47.125
Right, there you go.
How about Scott Baio?

52:47.126 --> 52:48.627
Eh.

52:48.628 --> 52:50.328
- Fred Thompson?
- No.

52:50.329 --> 52:51.696
Richard Gere.

52:51.697 --> 52:53.598
Richard Gere? "An officer and
a gentleman" Richard Gere?

52:53.599 --> 52:56.067
What the hell would he do with
racist bestiality joke movie?

52:56.068 --> 52:58.069
I don't know.
He might be into it.

52:58.070 --> 53:00.338
- You've heard those stories about him.
- What stories?

53:00.339 --> 53:01.940
- You know.
- Know what?

53:01.941 --> 53:04.710
- He put Goebbels up his ass.
- He did what?

53:04.711 --> 53:07.012
Goebbels... he put
Goebbels up his ass.

53:07.013 --> 53:08.713
- Goebbels?
- Yeah.

53:08.714 --> 53:11.099
Yeah, Goebbels...
the German guy.

53:12.285 --> 53:14.252
- Joseph Goebbels?
- That's him.

53:14.253 --> 53:16.855
- The Nazi minister of propaganda?
- That's him. That's the guy.

53:16.856 --> 53:19.507
Richard Gere put
Joseph Goebbels up his ass?

53:19.508 --> 53:20.935
Yeah, that's how they
got him out of Germany.

53:20.961 --> 53:21.292
What?

53:21.293 --> 53:23.094
- At the end of the war...
- Yeah?

53:23.095 --> 53:24.963
...when they were smuggling
Goebbels to Argentina...

53:24.989 --> 53:25.430
Right.

53:25.431 --> 53:28.316
...the only way to get Goebbels out of
Germany was inside Richard Gere's ass.

53:28.317 --> 53:29.851
Richard Gere?
The Richard Gere?

53:29.852 --> 53:31.486
- The guy from "pretty woman"?
- The very same.

53:31.487 --> 53:34.356
Went from Berlin to Buenos Aires
with Joseph Goebbels up his ass?

53:34.357 --> 53:36.041
I know.
Ain't it crazy?

53:36.042 --> 53:37.975
- You know? What do you know?
- Everybody knows.

53:37.976 --> 53:40.011
- He wasn't even around then.
- When?

53:40.012 --> 53:41.963
- At the same time as Goebbels.
- Says who?

53:41.964 --> 53:43.665
Says nobody.
He hadn't been born yet.

53:43.666 --> 53:45.917
Then let me ask you, why would
my Uncle make all this up?

53:45.918 --> 53:47.252
- Your Uncle?
- My Uncle.

53:47.253 --> 53:48.519
What's your Uncle
got to do with it?

53:48.520 --> 53:50.455
- He worked at the hospital.
- What hospital?

53:50.456 --> 53:52.474
The hospital where they
had to remove Goebbels.

53:52.475 --> 53:54.442
- What?
- He got stuck.

53:54.443 --> 53:55.994
- Oh, stop it.
- Yeah.

53:55.995 --> 53:57.429
- Come on.
- I'm telling you.

53:57.430 --> 53:59.247
He put Goebbels up there and
then he couldn't get him out.

53:59.248 --> 54:01.556
You're telling me Richard
Gere had Goebbels...

54:01.582 --> 54:02.133
Yeah.

54:02.134 --> 54:04.252
...jammed so far up there,
he couldn't get him out

54:04.253 --> 54:06.187
- without the help of major surgery?
- That is correct.

54:06.188 --> 54:08.005
- Oh please!
- I'm telling you.

54:08.006 --> 54:09.724
- He's a devout Buddhist.
- So?

54:09.725 --> 54:11.926
So why would a devout Buddhist go
and shove Goebbels up his ass?

54:11.927 --> 54:13.678
I don't know. Maybe he's
some kind of pervert.

54:13.679 --> 54:15.563
- These movies stars are pretty freaky.
- Not that freaky.

54:15.564 --> 54:18.300
- What, you know Richard Gere?
- No, I do not know Richard Gere.

54:18.301 --> 54:20.969
But I do know Richard Gere did
not do nothing with no Goebbels.

54:20.970 --> 54:23.722
- That's crazy.
- Well...

54:23.723 --> 54:25.456
My cousin though...
he was at that party

54:25.457 --> 54:28.026
where rod Stewart swallowed all that
jizz and had to have his stomach pumped.

54:28.027 --> 54:30.345
Now that's true.
Everybody knows that.

(PHONE RINGS)

54:34.500 --> 54:35.800
Hello.

54:35.801 --> 54:37.435
- Mr. Albertson?
- Yes.

54:37.436 --> 54:39.804
Yeah, this is sheriff Duncan
down at the station.

54:39.805 --> 54:41.740
It's about your son.

54:41.741 --> 54:45.076
I'm afraid I've got
good news and bad news.

54:45.077 --> 54:47.045
What's the bad news?

54:47.046 --> 54:51.116
Well, your son, it turns
out, was a tranny.

54:51.117 --> 54:53.869
He was dressing up
in ladies' clothes

54:53.870 --> 54:55.871
and hanging out
down by the docks

54:55.872 --> 54:59.707
and tricking longshoremen into
letting him give 'em blow jobs.

54:59.708 --> 55:01.125
What's the good news?

55:01.126 --> 55:04.429
Oh, the good news is
he's been murdered.

55:06.648 --> 55:08.116
Hi.

55:08.117 --> 55:09.467
I'll take
a gin and tonic.

55:13.806 --> 55:15.556
- What's that?
- Just try it.

55:20.229 --> 55:22.497
That tastes like gin.

55:22.498 --> 55:23.782
Turn it around.

55:27.219 --> 55:28.719
That tastes like tonic.

55:30.356 --> 55:32.157
Okay, how about
a vodka, orange juice?

55:39.448 --> 55:40.982
That's vodka.

55:40.983 --> 55:42.333
Turn it around.

55:43.869 --> 55:45.870
That's orange juice.
That's amazing.

55:45.871 --> 55:48.173
- Pretty neat, huh?
- Yeah, I'll say.

(WHISPERS) You know where I can
get some pussy around here?

56:02.872 --> 56:06.424
(SPITS) Jesus!
That tastes like shit.

56:06.425 --> 56:07.825
Turn it around.

56:19.037 --> 56:22.840
I have bad news
and I have really bad news.

56:22.841 --> 56:24.826
What's the really
bad news?

56:24.827 --> 56:27.829
You have terminal cancer.
You only have six months to live.

56:27.830 --> 56:31.800
- What's the bad news?
- You have Alzheimer's.

56:33.152 --> 56:35.637
Well, at least
I don't have cancer.

56:38.273 --> 56:40.642
(MUZAK PLAYING)

56:45.748 --> 56:48.233
- You wanted to see me?
- Come on in.

56:48.234 --> 56:49.551
Is there a problem?

56:49.552 --> 56:51.469
No, no problem,

56:51.470 --> 56:53.572
a concern.

56:53.573 --> 56:56.190
Now you know the jokes you sent me?
Some very funny stuff,

56:56.191 --> 56:59.093
but they're not
very sexy.

56:59.094 --> 57:01.112
Well, we're not making
some sort of...

57:01.113 --> 57:02.413
- No.
- ...Soft-core porn thing.

57:02.414 --> 57:04.416
No, but you gotta
keep your eye

57:04.417 --> 57:06.417
on the target audience...

57:06.418 --> 57:08.219
the marginally educated,

57:08.220 --> 57:12.089
the easily led,
bigoted,

57:12.090 --> 57:15.259
your stoners,
the hopelessly immature.

57:15.260 --> 57:17.328
- Americans?
- Yes.

57:17.329 --> 57:19.230
So let me just show you
what I'm thinking here.

57:19.231 --> 57:21.232
Dollface, come on up.

57:21.233 --> 57:23.768
This is Tiffany.

57:23.769 --> 57:25.654
She's new
to the business.

57:25.655 --> 57:27.488
Been out here, what,
six months now?

57:27.489 --> 57:29.190
- Eight years.
- Right.

57:29.191 --> 57:32.226
A very talented kid.
I met her at this thing.

57:32.227 --> 57:37.331
But, I don't know,
I want to use her somehow.

57:37.332 --> 57:39.000
Well, I don't know exactly...

57:39.001 --> 57:41.569
well, since you're asking,
this is what I was thinking...

57:41.570 --> 57:44.839
you know those bumpers that we
got in between the scenes...

57:44.840 --> 57:47.475
you know, man-on-the-street-
telling-the-joke kind of stuff?

57:47.476 --> 57:49.243
Well, Tiffany here
is a dancer...

57:49.244 --> 57:51.412
does stag nights,
bat mitzvahs, whatnot.

57:51.413 --> 57:54.332
So I'm thinking
she comes on out

57:54.333 --> 57:56.551
- in between the scenes...
- Uh-huh.

57:56.552 --> 57:58.803
...dances a little bit,

58:00.539 --> 58:02.607
and then
tells a joke.

58:02.608 --> 58:05.376
Well, I guess

58:05.377 --> 58:07.979
it's very sort of
postmodern vaudevillian.

58:07.980 --> 58:09.397
(HITS DESK) That's exactly
what I was thinking.

58:09.398 --> 58:11.099
That's exactly what I said.
Didn't I, honey?

58:11.100 --> 58:13.084
I mean, with the mainstreaming
of pornography,

58:13.085 --> 58:15.487
it's only natural that it
should go to vaudeville.

58:15.488 --> 58:16.921
Vaudeville, right.

58:16.922 --> 58:20.090
So, honey, show the man
what I taught you.

58:22.744 --> 58:25.080
Baby, the other thing.

58:25.081 --> 58:27.165
The other thing.

58:27.166 --> 58:28.333
Oh, okay.

58:28.334 --> 58:31.035
- The other thing.
- Okay.

58:33.255 --> 58:36.057
How do you get
an Iraqi woman pregnant?

58:36.058 --> 58:38.259
How?

58:48.437 --> 58:50.337
I forgot.

58:50.338 --> 58:51.690
Oh, Jesus Christ.

58:51.691 --> 58:53.241
No no no, she's got it.
She's got it.

58:53.242 --> 58:54.576
Come here, honey.

58:56.979 --> 58:58.980
- Huh? Huh?
- Okay.

58:58.981 --> 59:02.317
- Don't worry. Relax.
- Okay. Okay.

59:02.318 --> 59:04.519
- All right.
- Ahem.

59:04.520 --> 59:07.489
And action.

59:07.490 --> 59:11.159
How do you get
an Iraqi woman pregnant?

59:11.160 --> 59:14.879
Come on her feet and let
the flies do the rest.

59:14.880 --> 59:19.116
Huh? Did I tell you
the kid's a natural, huh?

59:19.117 --> 59:21.685
This isn't going
to Sundance, is it?

59:21.686 --> 59:24.406
Not unless
we add subtitles.

59:25.708 --> 59:28.042
Okay, I have good news
and bad news.

59:28.043 --> 59:29.877
What's the bad news?

59:29.878 --> 59:31.779
You have Alzheimer's.

59:31.780 --> 59:33.147
Well, what's
the good news?

59:33.148 --> 59:34.949
You can hide
your own easter eggs.

59:54.336 --> 59:57.305
Yeah, sure. Come on in, kid.
What's on your mind?

59:57.306 --> 01:00:00.108
Well, coach,

01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:02.277
you know those supplements
you've got us on...

01:00:02.278 --> 01:00:04.045
the steroids?

01:00:04.046 --> 01:00:05.113
Yeah.

01:00:05.114 --> 01:00:07.415
Well, I know
we want to win state,

01:00:07.416 --> 01:00:09.283
but there's a problem.

01:00:09.284 --> 01:00:10.869
What is it?

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:12.604
I have hair
on my chest.

01:00:14.473 --> 01:00:16.807
Oh Jesus.
How far down does that go?

01:00:16.808 --> 01:00:18.576
All the way
to my balls.

01:00:21.447 --> 01:00:22.881
Okay, so we're
gonna schedule

01:00:22.882 --> 01:00:25.550
your breast augmentation
surgery for next Wednesday.

01:00:25.551 --> 01:00:27.619
- Thank you, doctor.
- You're welcome.

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.854
- I have one other question.
- Yes?

01:00:29.855 --> 01:00:32.940
I'm leaving my husband because
he likes to fuck poultry,

01:00:32.941 --> 01:00:36.194
and I read about this
hymen reconstruction surgery

01:00:36.195 --> 01:00:39.063
that can restore
your virginity.

01:00:39.064 --> 01:00:40.999
Does it really work?

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.901
Well, yes and no.

01:00:43.902 --> 01:00:45.903
Think of it this way...

01:00:45.904 --> 01:00:48.006
you can roll back
the odometer,

01:00:48.007 --> 01:00:50.608
but you never get back
that new car smell.

(MUZAK PLAYING)

01:01:07.743 --> 01:01:11.579
Hey, what did the hooker
say to the chihuahua?

01:01:14.499 --> 01:01:16.951
"Hey! Watch the nylons."

01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:27.495
You like jokes?

01:01:35.286 --> 01:01:37.772
You like blow jobs?

01:01:48.684 --> 01:01:51.035
What do you call
a Mexican guy

01:01:51.036 --> 01:01:53.004
with a rubber toe?

01:01:54.106 --> 01:01:55.706
Ru-ber-to.

01:01:55.707 --> 01:01:57.175
No.

01:01:57.176 --> 01:01:59.093
Okay, what's
red and green

01:01:59.094 --> 01:02:01.128
and yellow and orange
and purple and pink?

01:02:01.129 --> 01:02:03.497
- DIRECTOR: What?
- A black guy dressed for church.

01:02:03.498 --> 01:02:05.333
- No.
- Okay.

01:02:05.334 --> 01:02:08.152
What did the Jewish pedophile
say to the little boy?

01:02:09.421 --> 01:02:12.289
"Hey, little boy,
wanna buy some candy?"

01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:17.361
Oh, come on,
that's funny.

01:02:17.362 --> 01:02:20.114
He wants to fuck the kid, but he's
too cheap to give him the candy.

01:02:20.115 --> 01:02:22.033
- It's a classic.
- It's not a classic.

01:02:22.034 --> 01:02:24.301
It's bullshit.
Not all Jews are cheap.

01:02:24.302 --> 01:02:25.886
Cheap?

01:02:25.887 --> 01:02:28.122
That's the part of the joke that
offends you... the cheap part?

01:02:28.123 --> 01:02:30.708
- Yes.
- It's okay that he's a pedophile?

01:02:30.709 --> 01:02:32.209
He just can't be
a cheap pedophile?

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:33.361
Yes.

01:02:34.463 --> 01:02:36.264
Explain that one.

01:02:36.265 --> 01:02:39.183
There's no stereotype
of Jews as pedophiles,

01:02:39.184 --> 01:02:42.403
so to say that this particular
Jewish person is a pedophile

01:02:42.404 --> 01:02:45.089
does nothing to perpetuate
false generalizations

01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:47.274
about the Jewish people.

01:02:47.275 --> 01:02:49.526
Saying that they control the
media or that they're cheap,

01:02:49.527 --> 01:02:51.129
on the other hand,
is offensive.

01:02:51.130 --> 01:02:54.915
So he can diddle little boys as
long as he pays retail for them?

01:02:56.235 --> 01:02:57.635
I'm done.

01:02:57.636 --> 01:03:00.471
That's the problem with you
and with everyone else.

01:03:00.472 --> 01:03:02.940
Everyone gets so offended
about their own stereotypes,

01:03:02.941 --> 01:03:04.925
- they have no concern for anyone else.
- I have...

01:03:04.926 --> 01:03:07.328
- what if I was a victim of child abuse?
- You weren't...

01:03:07.329 --> 01:03:08.679
or him?

01:03:10.649 --> 01:03:12.516
But that doesn't
matter to you

01:03:12.517 --> 01:03:15.152
as long as your people
don't get hurt.

01:03:15.153 --> 01:03:18.489
Child abuse is
a terrible thing, man.

01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:21.442
It tears families apart.

01:03:21.443 --> 01:03:24.094
Do you even know what the
number-one cause of pedophilia is?

01:03:24.095 --> 01:03:25.579
What?

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:27.482

01:03:27.483 --> 01:03:29.199
That's sick.
Go fuck yourself.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.636
- Oh, come on!
- You will never work in this town again!

01:03:31.637 --> 01:03:33.771
Oh yeah, like you're the one
that controls the media.

01:03:33.772 --> 01:03:35.690
I have relatives!

01:03:37.926 --> 01:03:40.060
Oh hey, it's okay.

01:03:40.061 --> 01:03:42.563
They don't really
control the media.

01:03:45.601 --> 01:03:47.602
Let's hope
they don't, huh?

01:03:47.603 --> 01:03:49.437
Right.

01:03:49.438 --> 01:03:51.573
What about
the Mexican jokes?

01:03:51.574 --> 01:03:55.276
Oh, that's fine.
They don't control anything.

01:03:55.277 --> 01:03:56.994
What is
the difference

01:03:56.995 --> 01:03:59.530
between a Jew
and a canoe?

01:03:59.531 --> 01:04:01.932
The canoe might tip.

01:04:03.985 --> 01:04:05.736
What's the problem?

01:04:05.737 --> 01:04:09.123
Every time I sneeze,
I have an orgasm.

01:04:09.124 --> 01:04:10.942
Don't worry.

01:04:10.943 --> 01:04:13.344
I am gonna write you
a prescription.

01:04:13.345 --> 01:04:15.479
What for?

Pepper.

a gay dinosaur?

really really rough.

- I almost didn't make it through.
- What happened?

Well, we went up
for our first jump.

01:04:33.899 --> 01:04:35.132
My turn came.

01:04:35.133 --> 01:04:37.068
I got right up to
the plane bay doors

01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:39.737
and I panicked. I chickened out.
I couldn't do it.

01:04:39.738 --> 01:04:42.506
- Holy shit.
- I back off,

01:04:42.507 --> 01:04:44.408
and then my sergeant
yells at me,

01:04:44.409 --> 01:04:47.712
"you jump out of this plane right now
or I'll stick my cock up your ass!"

01:04:47.713 --> 01:04:48.780
Did you jump?

01:04:48.781 --> 01:04:51.015
A little at first.

01:04:53.218 --> 01:04:56.187
- This dancing bimbo girl.
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:56.188 --> 01:04:58.556
- You already fucked her, right?
- Oh, and how.

01:04:58.557 --> 01:05:01.192
Then just let it go.
Please.

can see.

it looks like.
