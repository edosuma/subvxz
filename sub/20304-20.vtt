WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:04.462
-Give me an order, Lieutenant.
-Kiss me, Nurse Wulfawitz.

00:04.546 --> 00:06.923
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:07.007 --> 00:09.467
-The officer goes into the cell...
-And then he chokes him.

00:09.551 --> 00:11.803
I swear, Captain, I never touched the guy.

00:11.886 --> 00:13.763
-I'm pregnant, Frank.
-Paul Grogin.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.516
Do you each promise to love
and comfort one another

00:16.599 --> 00:18.518
in sickness, as well as in health?

00:18.601 --> 00:19.477
-We will.
-We do.

00:20.061 --> 00:22.564
(sobs) Frank, how could you do this to me?

00:22.856 --> 00:24.482
What's the matter, Sal, huh?

00:24.566 --> 00:25.984
You can't hit someone
when they're standing in front of you?

00:26.067 --> 00:27.902
<i>♪ Dum, dum, dum, dum ♪</i>

00:27.986 --> 00:30.405
Hey, spotlight on Rico!

00:30.488 --> 00:33.116
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:33.199 --> 00:35.994
You're gonna make it.
You're in your 53rd hour.

00:36.077 --> 00:36.911
(groans)

00:36.995 --> 00:39.914
Frank, I'm processing
Detective Benedetto's temporary transfer

00:39.998 --> 00:40.832
to your precinct.

00:40.915 --> 00:43.835
I thought you and I might
try living together.

00:43.918 --> 00:46.713
-I don't think so, Howard.
-Excuse me?

00:46.796 --> 00:49.924
T.J. had a knife, and he threw it
in a room when he ran.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.010
The murder in the shelter, Franklin.

00:52.093 --> 00:55.263
I don't know anything about the murder.
I'm a very old man.

00:55.346 --> 00:58.141
Come on, hold the thing up.
I can't see the damn-- Ow!

01:00.643 --> 01:04.272
-(all chattering)
-PHIL: All right. Item six.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.316
MAN: Oh, baby! Oh, baby! Oh, baby!

01:06.399 --> 01:07.942
(groaning, mumbling indistinctly)

01:08.026 --> 01:09.069
OFFICER 1: What's that?

01:09.694 --> 01:12.697
Hey, didn't that guy used to sing backup
for, uh, Frankie Valli?

01:12.781 --> 01:16.409
Would someone kindly inform Leo
about the condition of his charge?

01:17.077 --> 01:19.829
-Thanks,<i> papi.</i>
-PHIL: All right. Item six, people.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.831
Now, we'll jump ahead of police business

01:21.915 --> 01:24.459
to address the contents
of your pay envelopes.

01:24.542 --> 01:25.710
I wish you would.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.088
With regards to which
I have two statements to read

01:28.171 --> 01:29.881
from City Treasurer Fusko.

01:29.964 --> 01:33.051
Uh... "The irresponsible behavior
of certain city councilmen

01:33.134 --> 01:36.054
has forced the city to issue
promissory vouchers

01:36.137 --> 01:39.724
in lieu of salary checks
for the workweek ended last Friday."

01:40.308 --> 01:43.311
All we do is make ourselves
miserable chewing on this.

01:43.394 --> 01:46.731
Every-everything I hear suggests
the impasse at city council

01:47.023 --> 01:49.776
should be resolved in the next 24 hours.

01:49.859 --> 01:53.113
In the meantime,
there's a list on the upstairs board

01:53.196 --> 01:56.574
of supermarkets which are extending credit
to city employees.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.702
-(all chattering)
-Charity. Charity.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.871
Another piece of Lawrence Buddy Jeannette

02:01.955 --> 02:06.918
has surfaced behind Antonio's Pizza Disco
on the ferry last p.m.

02:08.086 --> 02:10.547
This makes an even dozen segments
of Mr. Jeannette

02:10.630 --> 02:13.174
to make gift-wrapped
postmortem appearance.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.303
Now, since pieces three, five,
and 11 surfaced here on the Hill,

02:17.595 --> 02:21.015
said discovery may have local implication.

02:21.724 --> 02:23.351
Press speculation about the involvement

02:23.434 --> 02:25.854
of one Roland Simone
of Midtown notwithstanding.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.063
...we pay for the vouchers.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.190
But it was parked on the street,
was not in the red,

02:29.274 --> 02:31.901
there was-- there was
no sign posted anywhere.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.362
Is this something we can
all appreciate, Robert?

02:34.779 --> 02:39.993
-They towed his car away, Sergeant.
-(laughter)

02:40.076 --> 02:43.955
Item eight. There's a visit today
from James Willett Frame.

02:44.956 --> 02:49.919
He's the American sales representative
of Coldwell and Louison Armors, Ltd.

02:50.420 --> 02:53.506
Showing their weapons line
at roll call shortly after we adjourn.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.424
Sign-up sheet's posted.

02:54.507 --> 02:58.887
Clear your availability with yours truly
or Lieutenant Calletano.

02:59.470 --> 03:03.725
Now, the lieutenant announces
the debut today of "Operation Cop Tip."

03:04.559 --> 03:10.398
Now, this is a citizen-participation
program underwritten by radio station WDPD

03:10.773 --> 03:15.987
paying $25 a throw
for information leading to arrests.

03:16.070 --> 03:23.077
I understand, uh, our pay situation
could, uh, prompt a gloomy outlook,

03:24.037 --> 03:29.125
but, as a last item,
let's note on the other side of the ledger

03:29.876 --> 03:31.961
this wonderful spring day.

03:32.795 --> 03:36.841
Fifty-five degrees at 6:50 a.m.
With a promise of 72.

03:37.091 --> 03:41.721
A cloudless sky, sap rising
even in old trunks like this one.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.768
Now, it's a good day to be alive
even with an empty pay envelope.

03:47.977 --> 03:51.773
'Course, this improved weather can comment
in rises in youthful transgressions,

03:51.856 --> 03:54.484
public intoxications,
and stoop-side drama.

03:54.859 --> 03:56.527
Patrols are advised.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.406
All right. That's it. Let's roll!

04:01.741 --> 04:03.368
And hey, hey, hey, hey!

04:05.453 --> 04:07.872
-Let's be careful out there.
-(indistinct chattering)

04:07.956 --> 04:11.542
OFFICER 2: I got a couple things to do.
I'll be right with you.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.295
-Come on, Joe.
-Yeah, right.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.798
-Look, Renko.
-Now, where's my reading material?

04:16.881 --> 04:18.716
Renko, if I don't pick up my car
by ten o'clock,

04:18.800 --> 04:20.218
they're gonna charge me for an extra day.

04:20.301 --> 04:23.179
Bobby Hill, do you realize
that 50 percent of irregularity

04:23.263 --> 04:27.100
can be directly traced to the distraction
and interruption of the daily routine?

04:27.725 --> 04:30.687
Bill, the boy downstairs
is having some real problems.

04:30.770 --> 04:34.274
He's in the homestretch.
He's in his third day.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.441
-Thank you.
-He's gonna make it.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.652
You know, you live in a dream world, pal.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.364
First time that kid breaks a shoelace,
he's right back on the stuff.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.366
How's your glass house, J.D.?

04:44.033 --> 04:46.119
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Figure it out.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.500
(groaning)

04:52.917 --> 04:56.087
Rico, here. Come on.

04:56.170 --> 05:00.675
(panting) Th-there was turtles.

05:01.426 --> 05:02.885
They was coming out of my chest.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.930
-Those aren't real.
-These were real!

05:06.389 --> 05:08.266
(groans, gulps)

05:08.891 --> 05:11.477
-Whoa. Whoa.
-Okay.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.480
-Oh. B-big ones.
-Okay.

05:15.106 --> 05:19.360
-Not like the carnival. Like the ocean.
-It's all right. It's okay.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.614
No. I-I don't think so, man.
I don't think so.

05:24.574 --> 05:27.327
You're gonna make it.
You're in your 53rd hour.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.121
(grunts, groans)

05:30.204 --> 05:34.167
It hurts too much. It's in my bones!

05:34.250 --> 05:40.548
-(shushes)
-(groans, pants)

05:47.347 --> 05:51.893
-Fifty-third hour.
-Fifty-third hour.

05:52.769 --> 05:56.356
-Homestretch.
-Ho... homestretch.

05:57.648 --> 06:02.487
Bet on me. Bet on... me.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.870
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch, we have a 9-11.</i>

06:11.287 --> 06:12.997
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

06:13.081 --> 06:16.793
<i>See Surplus Store, corner People's Drive</i>
<i>and 124th Street.</i>

06:24.008 --> 06:27.929
(theme music playing)

07:31.701 --> 07:34.620
(telephones ringing)

07:49.427 --> 07:50.928
What, you don't want me behind you?

07:51.012 --> 07:52.889
A partner of mine got
cold-cocked that way.

07:53.431 --> 07:57.602
Yeah. My sap slipped.
I'm gonna be up here a little while.

07:57.852 --> 08:00.229
-Why?
-BENEDETTO: Uh, got some work to do.

08:00.563 --> 08:05.485
Uh, look, I, uh, I kicked a few butts in
my time, and I had my butt kicked, huh?

08:05.568 --> 08:06.444
We're gonna be in the same pen.

08:06.527 --> 08:08.696
I want you to know
I'm okay with what happened.

08:09.155 --> 08:12.158
Which I don't know why you wouldn't be
since you cleaned my clock.

08:12.241 --> 08:14.202
RENKO: So, where does that leave us,
Mr. Benedetto?

08:15.369 --> 08:19.540
-Oh, scooter demon. You tell me.
-I'm thinking about it.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.751
You want a free shot? Hmm?

08:22.710 --> 08:25.421
Maybe sometime at night
when your back's turned.

08:26.756 --> 08:30.468
Andrew, Bobby, homicide
at the Butler Men's Shelter.

08:30.968 --> 08:32.220
See what you did, Renko?

08:33.638 --> 08:37.099
Hey, country,
look, I got some work to do here.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.310
I don't want to be worrying about my back.

08:40.770 --> 08:44.148
Don't worry about your back, pal.
Worry about your personality.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.867
-Morning.
-Uh, Detective.

08:55.701 --> 08:58.621
Frank, I'm processing
Detective Benedetto's temporary transfer

08:58.704 --> 08:59.622
to your precinct.

09:00.122 --> 09:04.126
He's come up with a plan to implicate
Roland Simone in a major drug situation.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.378
Simone's a loan shark out in midtown.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.922
Simone's an embarrassment
to this entire city.

09:08.005 --> 09:11.259
He's bankrolling a lot of other action.
Dope, death...

09:11.467 --> 09:13.511
They just found piece 12
of Buddy Jeannette.

09:13.594 --> 09:14.929
DANIELS: And I'm determined to stop him.

09:15.012 --> 09:17.265
The detective's proposal
couldn't have been more timely.

09:17.348 --> 09:21.435
Now, it routes through the hill.
He'll fill you in on all the details.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.188
He's to get full cooperation, Frank.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.864
Gee, uh, my phone must
have been out of order.

09:33.948 --> 09:36.701
If I'd wanted you at this meeting, Jerry,
you'd have been notified.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.995
Is this about Rollie Simone? Huh?

09:39.704 --> 09:42.832
The plan that I called you about?
With my detective?

09:42.915 --> 09:47.670
And I was grateful for the input.
It's my best judgment, however, Jerry,

09:47.753 --> 09:50.423
implementation should come
through<i> this </i>office.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.300
Your detective's been reassigned.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.010
JERRY:
You're not gonna give me joint venture?

09:54.093 --> 09:56.429
I wouldn't think you'd be
bringing up joint venture.

09:56.721 --> 09:59.849
Not with Stan Meisel's egg
still on all our faces.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.935
Look, if you're gonna kill my career,
do it all at once!

10:03.019 --> 10:05.354
Don't piece me out!
Don't Buddy Jeannette me!

10:05.438 --> 10:07.607
Do you really think this
is an appropriate place

10:07.690 --> 10:10.109
for a career counseling session, Captain?

10:12.069 --> 10:13.446
Ride downtown with me.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.117
How are your people
on this voucher situation?

10:18.200 --> 10:20.411
-All right... so far.
-Good.

10:24.206 --> 10:27.251
No nonsense while you're up on the hill,
Benedetto. Understand?

10:27.418 --> 10:31.589
No pool, no over and under,
no garbage about Jeannette's body.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.799
-BENEDETTO: Got you, Captain.
-Frank.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.514
Guess him and the chief
aren't getting along.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.308
Just run it down.

10:42.642 --> 10:46.312
We, uh, busted 20 keys of soda
in midtown a couple months ago.

10:46.395 --> 10:49.065
Simone had to be the banker,
but there's no way to make him.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.525
Now, I want him to think
he's holding paper on a cop,

10:51.609 --> 10:53.361
make an approach to get the stuff back.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.529
It's in the midtown property room. Why?

10:55.863 --> 10:57.990
Hey, Simone's no dope, Captain.

10:58.366 --> 11:01.035
Midtown cop approaches him,
he's gonna smell a rat.

11:01.410 --> 11:04.664
There's a shylock up there.
This, uh, Mouse Feldstein. Mo.

11:05.247 --> 11:07.708
I'm gonna pop him, have him
sell his loans to Simone,

11:07.792 --> 11:09.835
then we run in the cop's note
with the rest of the paper.

11:09.919 --> 11:14.298
The cop should preferably be, uh, colored.
That's most of Mo's clients.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.634
This, uh, this kid Hill's got guts.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.470
Hill's a motor patrolman. He doesn't know
anything about detective work.

11:19.553 --> 11:22.306
-You'll work with Neal Washington.
-Whatever's right.

11:22.723 --> 11:25.226
I know what you did
to Officer Renko, Detective,

11:25.309 --> 11:26.977
and I know what Officer Hill did to you.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.771
Yeah, everything's okay.
I squared with both of them.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.064
FRANK: That's not the point.

11:30.147 --> 11:32.358
If you were on my roster,
you'd have been out the next day.

11:32.441 --> 11:35.444
We don't have any wild west show up here
and we don't have any freelancers.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.947
You operate out of this precinct,
you're gonna clear procedure

11:38.030 --> 11:39.573
and you're gonna go by the book.
Understood?

11:39.865 --> 11:41.117
-Gotcha.
-FRANK: That's the "B" answer.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.327
The "A" answer is "Yes, Captain."

11:48.374 --> 11:50.960
Neal. No, just Neal, J.D.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.339
It would have taken two minutes
to pick up my car.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.508
Take it easy.
We're on a homicide call, here, pal.

11:57.591 --> 12:01.345
So, where's he going? Nobody's
gonna charge<i> him </i>for an extra day.

12:03.347 --> 12:08.018
My God, he's dead! (sobs)

12:08.102 --> 12:08.978
Hey, pal.

12:11.647 --> 12:12.857
Oh, God.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.445
This guy's in some kind of trance
over here of something.

12:20.030 --> 12:21.574
T.J. killed him and he ran off.

12:21.657 --> 12:23.367
Okay, buddy, we're gonna have
to frisk you here now.

12:23.451 --> 12:26.579
T.J. had a knife,
and he threw it in a room when he ran.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.622
-BOBBY: Uh-huh.
-RENKO: Who-who is T.J., huh?

12:28.706 --> 12:32.042
He has a bunk in the back.
I don't go near him 'cause he's crazy.

12:32.126 --> 12:35.171
And he said the old man took his towel
and then he stabbed him!

12:35.254 --> 12:36.297
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.883
-All right, now. Take it easy, now, man.
-Where's Wash?

12:39.258 --> 12:41.093
Doing a rhumba with Sal Benedetto.
How the hell would I know?

12:41.177 --> 12:42.845
What does this guy look like, all right?

12:42.928 --> 12:47.683
He has a blue windbreaker.
And he has blue eyes.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.480
And he has a cruel mouth.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.440
Hey. Hey, buddy. Come here. Come here.

12:54.523 --> 12:56.567
-Do you know this guy?
-I've seen him.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.694
What about this guy T.J.
he's yelling about?

12:58.778 --> 13:01.197
(scoffs) Look, I don't know.
You know, they're bums.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.157
They come and they go. I don't-- maybe.

13:03.824 --> 13:06.744
Okay. All right.
Hey, you, what's your name?

13:07.411 --> 13:09.497
Buddy, come on. Come on.
What's your name, huh?

13:12.374 --> 13:13.459
-Reggie.
-J.D.: All right.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.835
Now, let me see some I.D., okay, Reggie?

13:14.919 --> 13:17.087
He doesn't have anything, J.D.
A piece of gum.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.464
He doesn't even have a wallet.

13:18.547 --> 13:21.133
Okay, now, Reggie, look, look.
What you're gonna do here, okay,

13:21.217 --> 13:23.928
you're gonna go to the station with me
and my friends, okay?

13:24.011 --> 13:25.429
-You got him?
-Yeah.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.224
Renko, let's go look for that knife, huh?

13:30.434 --> 13:34.146
All right, Reggie.
I gotta put these handcuffs on you, buddy.

13:34.897 --> 13:38.317
It's okay. I don't want to be here.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.320
Because he might come back.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.953
And now for the<i> pièce de résistance.</i>

13:49.036 --> 13:54.375
Gentlemen, I would like you to meet
Coldwell and Louiston's TK460R.

13:55.835 --> 13:56.669
MAN: Wow.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.925
-WOMAN: Now, that's cute.
-MAN: Looks like my cousin Vinny.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.593
Judas H.

14:05.052 --> 14:05.970
I hope you like the little bugger.

14:06.053 --> 14:09.014
He's on a promotional loan to your
department for the next two weeks.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.184
Well, what exactly does he do?

14:12.768 --> 14:15.521
Oh, TK460 can be programmed
for any number of tasks.

14:15.604 --> 14:19.567
Primarily his function is surveillance.
Particularly handy in hostage situations.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.734
Completely bulletproof.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.987
It can be sent into an area
where an officer's life

14:23.070 --> 14:25.698
-would be grossly endangered.
-PHIL: I see, James.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.908
Now, what does he do once he's there?

14:27.992 --> 14:31.787
First of all, the chest cavity contains
a dual two-way stereo speaker system

14:31.954 --> 14:35.332
enabling you to initiate a dialog
with a suspect,

14:35.416 --> 14:37.084
uh, thereby eliminating your having

14:37.167 --> 14:39.086
to rely upon telephonic means
of communication.

14:39.169 --> 14:42.715
Said dialog failing, there's a 45-mm
turret in the arm extender.

14:42.798 --> 14:46.051
And for particularly nasty chaps,
a flamethrower here.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.221
Now, let us suppose
you have a hostage situation

14:49.305 --> 14:51.140
in your basement holding facility.

14:51.223 --> 14:54.977
You would send TK into the area
using this control, like so.

14:56.562 --> 14:57.438
Off you go.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.275
Now, you see the device also contains
a hidden video camera

15:01.358 --> 15:04.361
which transmits an image to this screen

15:05.154 --> 15:06.989
giving you an instant summation
of the situation,

15:07.072 --> 15:09.950
i.e., number of hostages,
position of suspects,

15:10.034 --> 15:12.703
and areas subject to vulnerability.

15:12.912 --> 15:17.666
(on TV)<i> Oh, no!</i>
<i>Don't send the turtle king, Pepe!</i>

15:18.542 --> 15:20.419
<i>No, don't send the turtle king, Pepe!</i>

15:21.587 --> 15:24.298
<i>I gave it to Bo!</i>
<i>I gave the stuff to Bo! Come on!</i>

15:25.841 --> 15:27.843
I've been banking with you people
for nine years.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.970
Uh, you can't cover my check for two days?

15:31.263 --> 15:33.098
Yeah, well, I think your policy stinks.

15:35.476 --> 15:39.480
Okay, fella, again.
What does "T.J." stand for?

15:41.482 --> 15:42.524
How is it you know him?

15:43.108 --> 15:46.320
Hey, hey.
I asked you "How is it you know him?"

15:47.571 --> 15:51.033
Look, you want me to just kinda skip ahead
to the $100 question?

15:51.116 --> 15:52.201
Any problem here?

15:52.284 --> 15:54.495
Yeah, we got a possible suspect
in a murder here, Captain.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.956
Some guy named T.J.
stabbed this other character

15:57.039 --> 15:59.500
and dumped the knife on the premises.
We haven't found either one of them yet.

15:59.583 --> 16:03.253
Uh, Captain, his record's clean
as far as the name he gave us,

16:03.337 --> 16:06.340
but I'm running his prints.
Now, you ask me, he's our man.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.676
-Get the weapon.
-I'd like a lawyer.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.929
Miss Davenport's up here.
Maybe she's available. Hill.

16:13.764 --> 16:14.974
Escort the man to interrogation

16:15.057 --> 16:16.809
and sit with him
until she gets here, okay?

16:19.395 --> 16:22.064
Sorry, babe, but I'm hooked up with
Benedetto for the next couple of days.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.692
What? What? Hey, hey.
What are you talking about?

16:25.025 --> 16:27.111
Some loan shark bust down in midtown.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.113
He just needed some local cover,
that's all.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.366
Man, Benedetto's a slime. Come on, man.

16:32.449 --> 16:34.535
I wouldn't trust that clown
as far as I could throw him.

16:34.618 --> 16:36.120
Hey, hey, look, I gotta run, babe.
Talk with you later.

16:36.203 --> 16:39.331
Hey, wait. Where the hell does that leave
me for the rest of the week?

16:40.624 --> 16:43.961
We've got the number and calls
on the cop tip line, J.D.

16:44.211 --> 16:45.879
I'd like you and Belker to check them out.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.257
-Ha. Me and Belker?
-Yes.

16:53.637 --> 16:55.014
I want to know right now, Frank.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.890
-What's he gonna call her?
-FRANK: Call who?

16:57.141 --> 17:00.227
Now, he can call her Joyce.
He can call her Ms. Davenport.

17:00.310 --> 17:01.729
He can call her Auntie Joyce.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.023
He can call her Wonder Woman
for all I care.

17:04.356 --> 17:08.318
But I will not let my son call her mom!
Now, is that understood? I will not!

17:08.652 --> 17:12.656
Uh, could we just start from square one?
Could you tell me what happened?

17:18.162 --> 17:20.873
Frank Jr. wants to move in
with his<i> new mother,</i>

17:20.956 --> 17:22.374
as he chooses to call her.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.960
I caught him sneaking out
of the apartment this morning

17:25.044 --> 17:27.504
with two suitcases
and all his video game cassettes.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.632
I see. Did you have some kind of argument?

17:30.966 --> 17:33.343
No. It just came out of nowhere!

17:33.427 --> 17:35.721
Maybe he feels that if you're entitled
to another child,

17:35.804 --> 17:37.931
-he's entitled to another mother.
-You think that's it?

17:38.390 --> 17:40.517
I mean, really,
you think maybe he's just jealous?

17:40.601 --> 17:41.769
Well, that could be part of it.

17:41.852 --> 17:44.188
Fay, you're gonna have to
let him find a place

17:44.271 --> 17:46.148
for Joyce inside himself, you know.

17:46.231 --> 17:49.234
I mean, without changing his love
for you in any way.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.739
-FAY: I know, Frank.
-I mean, she's his stepmother now.

17:54.698 --> 17:59.161
I know, (groans) but I just don't
want him to call her mommy!

17:59.244 --> 18:00.746
He shouldn't and he won't.

18:09.588 --> 18:10.422
Good.

18:11.298 --> 18:15.803
Uh, also... I think maybe the three of us
should get together

18:15.886 --> 18:17.930
and, uh, lay down some guidelines.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.890
Great. Two against one.

18:20.182 --> 18:23.435
Okay. All right.
Maybe just the two of you.

18:24.269 --> 18:27.481
Look, you're gonna have to get together
and come to terms sooner or later.

18:28.023 --> 18:31.527
Okay. She can call me. I'm in the book.

18:34.029 --> 18:34.947
Under "Furillo."

18:41.745 --> 18:42.996
Or I'll call her.

18:44.206 --> 18:48.418
Uh, Frank-- Oh, Fay. Oh...

18:49.169 --> 18:53.549
Nothing like one in the oven to bring
a flush to the old cheek.

18:54.883 --> 18:59.638
-Oh, fecund mother earth.
-Stick it, Howard.

19:02.850 --> 19:06.311
(chuckles) Pregnant women, their, uh,
their hormones run amuck.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.231
FRANK: What can I do for you, Howard?

19:09.314 --> 19:11.525
I'd like an extra half-hour for lunch,
old sport.

19:11.900 --> 19:12.901
No problem.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.362
-I'm having lunch with Linda Wulfawitz.
-Oh?

19:15.445 --> 19:19.408
It may be a significant repast, Frank.
Relation-wise.

19:20.450 --> 19:24.621
-Howard, you're gonna propose?
-Well, I don't exclude that possibility.

19:24.705 --> 19:28.417
I thought I would broach
cohabitation to begin-- uh, Counselor.

19:28.500 --> 19:32.421
-Lieutenant. Frank, do you have a moment?
-Marriage agrees with you.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.506
Thank you. It's important.

19:44.808 --> 19:47.895
I want you to meet Franklin Butterball.
He's a teacher.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.646
He's 82 years old.

19:51.106 --> 19:54.443
-Joyce...
-Tell him about T.J. and the murder.

19:57.070 --> 20:02.284
T.J. was a wicked, wicked boy.

20:04.536 --> 20:05.454
He was a bully.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.166
-And there were times--
-In the past 20 minutes,

20:09.249 --> 20:11.543
I've talked to a Black prostitute
named Angel,

20:12.461 --> 20:14.463
a computer programmer named Bruce,

20:14.838 --> 20:17.633
and now a retired school teacher
from West Texas.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.343
They all saw the murder,

20:19.426 --> 20:21.428
they all know this T.J.
in one way or another,

20:21.511 --> 20:24.431
and they're all scared to death of him.
At first, I thought it was a put-on.

20:24.514 --> 20:28.852
How did it happen, Franklin? The murder?

20:29.478 --> 20:32.522
I don't know anything about the murder.
I'm a very old man.

20:32.606 --> 20:35.234
-Please leave me alone.
-What happened to the knife?

20:35.943 --> 20:38.570
I don't know. He... he...

20:43.909 --> 20:44.993
Jimmy knows.

20:47.037 --> 20:49.915
He might tell you.
He's much stronger than I am.

20:49.998 --> 20:51.917
We'd like to talk to Jimmy, Franklin.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.170
-Can you help us do that?
-REGGIE: No.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.385
Jimmy?

21:07.307 --> 21:10.185
-Jimmy?
-Could be.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.980
What happened to the knife, Jimmy?

21:13.063 --> 21:17.150
(chuckles) Hey, what with the knife?
Everybody wants to know about the knife.

21:17.442 --> 21:20.904
-You saw T.J. put the knife somewhere?
-Yeah, maybe.

21:21.280 --> 21:25.909
-Are you as afraid of T.J. as the others?
-Hey, hey.

21:26.785 --> 21:30.414
Now, my life's not rough enough as it is
without you guys all over my back, huh?

21:30.497 --> 21:33.583
Jimmy, could we talk to T.J.?

21:35.127 --> 21:38.714
(chuckles, hisses)

21:53.562 --> 21:55.397
(telephone rings)

22:04.948 --> 22:07.576
(sighs) Well... Frank?

22:08.910 --> 22:09.995
Is that an act or what?

22:10.579 --> 22:12.706
I've read about multiple
personality disorders before,

22:12.789 --> 22:14.416
but that's the first time
I've ever seen one.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.585
I'm phoning county medical.

22:17.127 --> 22:18.378
We'll give them custody
until the arraignment.

22:18.462 --> 22:20.339
Even if it's an act,
it's way out of our league.

22:20.422 --> 22:23.091
Excuse me, gentlemen,
but aren't you jumping the gun, here?

22:23.592 --> 22:26.094
There's no conclusive evidence
tying him to a murder.

22:26.678 --> 22:27.929
We have to find that knife.

22:29.181 --> 22:32.100
-You got my car.
-License and make.

22:32.267 --> 22:36.605
-'81 Camaro 142OHG.
-It's 90 bucks.

22:41.443 --> 22:45.530
No checks.
It's $25 for the ticket, $65 for the tow.

22:45.989 --> 22:47.741
My bank's all the way across town.

22:47.824 --> 22:50.243
You're telling me you're a cop
and you don't know we don't take checks?

22:50.327 --> 22:52.287
You ever listen to that radio, mister?

22:52.788 --> 22:57.459
We didn't get paid today. We got vouchers.
Let me just give you a check.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.669
By the time it gets to my bank,
the money will be there.

23:00.003 --> 23:03.006
Hey, Marty, it's getting deep in here.
You better bring me my boots.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.925
I'm tapped, you understand?

23:05.008 --> 23:07.552
I'll make the check good.
Just give me a little more time.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.429
Yeah, like when we need
some help from you.

23:09.513 --> 23:12.516
And what do we get?
We're private. We're on contract.

23:12.599 --> 23:14.810
You know, you guys are really scum.
You're the scum of the earth!

23:15.143 --> 23:17.938
You may be getting off on your little
bureaucratic power trip here,

23:18.021 --> 23:20.941
but as far as I'm concerned,
you're nothing but a...

23:21.024 --> 23:24.444
(muffled) hyped-up parking junkie
with a crowbar between your ears!

23:25.737 --> 23:30.492
Hey, I'm real upset.
I'm gonna have to see my therapist.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.205
I gotta get out of here, Renko.

23:36.873 --> 23:39.543
(Benedetto chuckles)
Hey. Hey, no offense, Washington.

23:39.751 --> 23:42.838
I just hate to see a smart guy
like yourself stuck with a derelict.

23:42.921 --> 23:45.966
-LaRue's got a few rough edges. So what?
-(chuckles)

23:46.049 --> 23:49.845
A few, huh? I know guys in midtown place
take his career bio

23:49.928 --> 23:51.888
into the head for light reading material.

23:51.972 --> 23:55.600
(chuckles) Suspensions, 502s,
uh, bottle problems.

23:55.684 --> 23:58.103
You take away the rough edges,
all you got is a fake Rolex

23:58.186 --> 24:00.522
and a cheap pair of loafers. (chuckles)

24:00.605 --> 24:03.066
-MO: Yeah?
-(coughs) Come on.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.402
-MO: Yeah. Yeah.
-(clears throat)

24:06.153 --> 24:08.155
-What do you want?
-You, Feldstein. Open the door.

24:08.238 --> 24:10.782
Detectives Washington and Benedetto,
Mr. Feldstein. We got a warrant.

24:10.866 --> 24:15.328
-Just open the door, you little geek.
-Show me the warrant. Come on, show me.

24:16.538 --> 24:19.666
You really want to see the warrant,
Mr. Feldstein?

24:19.875 --> 24:22.210
Yeah. Yeah, I want to see the warrant.

24:23.795 --> 24:27.883
(coughs) All right.
Here's your warrant, Mo.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.218
Come on, hold the thing up.
I can't see the damn--

24:30.302 --> 24:32.679
-(groans) Ooh, my nose!
-(chuckles)

24:32.762 --> 24:35.474
-You're crazy. You're killing me.
-All right. Let's see here, uh.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.684
Oh, it says something about usury.

24:37.934 --> 24:40.145
I think that means
loan-sharking there, Mo.

24:40.228 --> 24:42.355
(chuckles) And, uh, something else about--

24:42.439 --> 24:44.441
-(groans)
-Oh, man, I can't quite make this out.

24:44.524 --> 24:48.653
You know, it's something about
utilizing the public utilities

24:48.737 --> 24:51.323
-in the commission of a felony.
-Hey, what the hell's wrong with you, man?

24:51.406 --> 24:52.616
I'm just getting
the guy's attention is all.

24:52.699 --> 24:54.451
-Please, come on. Let go.
-(chuckles)

24:54.534 --> 24:57.245
Hey, look, I'm sorry
I'm taking so long, here, Mo,

24:57.329 --> 24:59.372
but the light, it's not so good out here.
You know what I mean?

24:59.456 --> 25:02.209
There. There, see, I got the door open,
okay? Please let go.

25:02.292 --> 25:06.171
Hey, Sal's little helpers, huh? (laughs)

25:07.214 --> 25:11.801
You creep! You're an animal!
What do you want from me?

25:11.885 --> 25:13.929
Nice place you got here, Mo.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.847
We're gonna have to take you down
to the station, Mr. Feldstein.

25:15.931 --> 25:18.433
Well, what have we got here? Let's see.

25:19.309 --> 25:23.355
A big mess, that's what we got. (chuckles)

25:24.231 --> 25:27.609
Hey, you don't mind if we take
your paper along, do you, Mo?

25:29.027 --> 25:30.820
Can I help you gentlemen,
or are you just browsing?

25:31.780 --> 25:35.492
Is this your arm-buster, Mo?
Or did the circus just hit town?

25:35.575 --> 25:38.578
I got it covered, Crockett.
Catch you later.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.373
Crockett? You're Sonny Crockett?

25:41.456 --> 25:43.875
No. I'm Martin Luther King.

25:44.834 --> 25:50.215
Hey, whoever you are...
I think you entered the wrong premises.

25:50.757 --> 25:52.300
The toilet's down the hall.

25:52.634 --> 25:53.718
Go on, take a walk.

25:55.762 --> 25:58.765
Yeah... good idea.

26:02.269 --> 26:04.187
-(groans)
-(glass shatters)

26:04.271 --> 26:05.772
(clattering)

26:07.691 --> 26:08.775
Freeze!

26:09.568 --> 26:13.113
-(gun shots)
-(thuds)

26:19.077 --> 26:19.911
Man's dead.

26:20.203 --> 26:23.915
(panting)
Yeah, I knew something was wrong with him.

26:25.625 --> 26:28.211
Thanks, my man. You just saved my butt.

26:30.171 --> 26:35.051
No problem.
Hey, Mo, you got any rope, huh?

26:35.677 --> 26:38.555
I want to tie the guy
to the fender of my car.

26:39.222 --> 26:41.391
I'm gonna mount the fat slob on my wall.

26:41.474 --> 26:45.061
(chuckles)
Hey, that's a joke, Mo, a joke, huh?

26:45.145 --> 26:47.355
Relax a minute. (chuckles)

26:47.439 --> 26:49.190
I'm gonna drop a dime downtown

26:49.649 --> 26:52.485
and then we're gonna get my partner here
over to emergency, huh?

27:00.660 --> 27:03.079
-Isn't this delightful?
-(chuckles)

27:04.748 --> 27:06.708
Linda, let me speak directly to the point.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.878
-Please.
-How did Chaucer put it?

27:11.046 --> 27:13.757
"Whan that Aprill with his shoures soote

27:14.424 --> 27:17.302
the droughte of March hath
perced to the roote..."

27:18.011 --> 27:20.930
Howard, you were going
to get straight to the point.

27:21.014 --> 27:23.516
(chuckles)
Well, I'm not a young man, Linda,

27:23.600 --> 27:26.186
but my fancy's turned to love.

27:27.646 --> 27:31.149
More specifically,
I was thinking that you and I

27:31.232 --> 27:35.528
might attempt a more intimate
domestic arrangement.

27:38.531 --> 27:41.409
I thought you and I might
try living together.

27:43.161 --> 27:45.997
-I don't think so, Howard.
-Excuse me?

27:47.332 --> 27:52.128
No. I-- in fact, I think we
should reconsider everything.

27:52.212 --> 27:55.006
I... I think we should stop
seeing each other.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.884
Or we could leave things
exactly as they are.

27:57.967 --> 28:02.889
Howard, you have so many--
some wonderful, wonderful qualities,

28:02.972 --> 28:04.724
but we just aren't compatible.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.103
-You're angry at me.
-I'm not angry at you.

28:08.478 --> 28:12.565
No, I'm angry at myself
because I let things go on so long.

28:12.732 --> 28:15.860
I'm always like that, Howard.
I-I store up my grievances.

28:17.654 --> 28:21.741
Or perhaps we could work
together to improve ourselves.

28:21.825 --> 28:27.872
No. I-I... (sighs) I can't make a life
with a man who's so... myopic.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.876
Howard, you have your interests
and that's it.

28:31.960 --> 28:35.672
I mean, no one cares about the longevity
of the M16 as a weapon of war,

28:35.755 --> 28:37.298
certainly not my parents.

28:37.549 --> 28:40.468
I mean, they don't want to see
your magnum .357.

28:40.927 --> 28:42.011
That was months ago.

28:42.470 --> 28:45.223
Howard, do you realize
at the hospital Christmas party

28:45.306 --> 28:48.977
we began with 14 people at our table
and ended up with you, me,

28:49.060 --> 28:51.646
and the history of Fidel Castro's
mountain campaign?

28:51.938 --> 28:55.775
Well, I can't help having a grudging
admiration for that brigand.

28:56.276 --> 28:59.487
Uh, that's not the point. I-I see that.

28:59.863 --> 29:02.031
(scoffs) It doesn't matter.

29:05.326 --> 29:06.745
Is there someone else?

29:10.331 --> 29:11.916
Well, I'm seeing someone,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.711
but I can't tell how serious
that's going to become.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.258
-A doctor?
-A urologist.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.680
-Jewish?
-It so happens.

29:26.306 --> 29:27.682
But, Howard, that isn't why.

29:29.893 --> 29:33.521
Oh, Howard, I'm so sorry
that this is ending like this.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.733
You're such a good, sweet man.

29:37.901 --> 29:39.527
(chuckles) Myopic, huh?

29:41.654 --> 29:44.574
(clears throat)
I better get my lenses checked.

29:46.743 --> 29:47.577
(Mo sniffs)

29:51.080 --> 29:52.957
You guys wanna tell me
what this is all about?

29:53.041 --> 29:55.001
BENEDETTO:
Simple, Mo. You're gonna retire.

29:55.084 --> 29:57.170
You can make your own arrangements
in Florida,

29:57.253 --> 29:59.297
or we could put you
on a group plan upstate.

30:00.632 --> 30:04.844
Hey, this is a nickel beef.
You're telling me I'm gonna go to jail?

30:04.928 --> 30:06.054
NEAL: You can count on it, Mo-ski.

30:06.346 --> 30:09.140
Three years, 36 months,
and you ain't no chicken no more, baby.

30:09.432 --> 30:13.645
Hey, fellas, I'm just a "B" team player
in this racket.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.688
Come on, what are you
picking on me for, huh?

30:15.772 --> 30:17.607
We want you to call Rollie Simone, Mo.

30:18.107 --> 30:19.400
Want you to sell him your paper.

30:22.070 --> 30:22.904
No way.

30:25.323 --> 30:28.243
I'm not setting up Rollie Simone
for no police action. (chuckles)

30:28.618 --> 30:29.452
What, do you think I'm crazy?

30:29.536 --> 30:31.830
Life could get real tense
on the home front, Mo.

30:32.580 --> 30:35.875
You got kids in college.
A wife who plays mahjong.

30:36.668 --> 30:39.629
-Look, I'm not gonna do it, fellas--
-We think you're smart, Mouse.

30:40.255 --> 30:43.758
We think you know when you're all done
and the best way to get out of the game.

30:45.301 --> 30:46.761
Simone's a smart cookie.

30:47.262 --> 30:51.057
He knows that this guy you shot,
this Crockett, maybe worked for me.

30:51.766 --> 30:53.810
He hears Crockett's dead,
he's gonna know I'm jammed up.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.562
He won't come near me with a fork.

30:55.645 --> 30:58.439
Simone ain't gonna know Crockett's dead
unless you tell him, Mo.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.483
We're putting Crockett on the stiff train.

31:00.692 --> 31:03.319
No one's gonna know he's dead
for 48 hours, Mo.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.822
Now you sell Simone your paper,
you get out of dodge,

31:05.905 --> 31:06.948
you're in great shape.

31:07.156 --> 31:09.993
I just know you're the kind of guy saved
a few bucks, Mouse, huh?

31:10.285 --> 31:12.704
Hey, I'll be lucky if he gives
me 40 cents on the dollar.

31:12.787 --> 31:14.789
NEAL:
Hey, we're gonna take care of you, Mo.

31:15.582 --> 31:18.877
Add a loan for $28,000.
Make the paper out to me, okay?

31:18.960 --> 31:22.088
And when Rollie asks about it,
you be sure and tell him

31:22.171 --> 31:25.133
Washington's a narcotics cop
with money problems

31:25.216 --> 31:28.511
and a bad habit.
Whatever you sell that paper for is yours.

31:30.305 --> 31:32.056
You know I've been good to you people.

31:32.765 --> 31:35.852
I mean, I loan cops
at half vig all the time.

31:35.935 --> 31:37.937
(stutters) Look it here.
Cops on the hill, huh?

31:39.022 --> 31:41.399
Bobby Hill, Julio Sánchez, eh?

31:41.691 --> 31:44.110
-Bobby Hill?
-Yeah, I loaned him four yards.

31:44.485 --> 31:46.237
He was having some family problems.

31:52.911 --> 31:53.828
(door closes)

32:00.585 --> 32:01.878
Let's make a phone call, Mo.

32:03.963 --> 32:05.465
LUCY: Watch this. Watch it. Look.

32:05.882 --> 32:07.675
-Come on, Rhoda.
-(robot whirring)

32:07.759 --> 32:09.594
JOE: Yeah. Come on, Luce,
you're hogging it.

32:09.677 --> 32:11.095
And I already named him "Denny."

32:11.179 --> 32:13.806
LUCY: Forget about it.
I'm just getting the hang of this thing.

32:31.032 --> 32:32.116
Watch this.

32:32.992 --> 32:36.871
(clicks, whirring)

32:52.637 --> 32:56.557
(screams) Oh, stupid rob--<i> Ay!</i>

33:04.649 --> 33:06.818
What are you doing over here
with that thing?

33:06.901 --> 33:08.569
-I--
-You have burned both my legs!

33:08.653 --> 33:10.780
-I'm sorry, Lieutenant. I didn't--
-HOWARD: Bates!

33:11.114 --> 33:11.948
Yes, sir?

33:12.323 --> 33:14.325
Bates, have you read the manual
on this device?

33:14.409 --> 33:16.995
-No, I haven't, but I--
-You think this is some kind of a toy

33:17.078 --> 33:19.706
for you to play with? Judas H.

33:19.789 --> 33:24.836
You know that the predecessors
of the TK4600 have soft-landed on Mars?

33:27.213 --> 33:30.842
Low-rent anthropomorphizing
sentimentality.

33:31.217 --> 33:33.511
-(robot whirring)
-RAY: Get that thing away from me!

33:34.846 --> 33:36.389
I'm gonna remember that chump's face!

33:36.472 --> 33:38.224
I'm gonna remember him
'cause if I ever pull him over,

33:38.307 --> 33:41.894
if I ever get him in my car,
I'm gonna put him through cop hell!

33:41.978 --> 33:43.479
-What's up?
-Oh, this--

33:43.563 --> 33:47.442
I have never seen this individual
as angry as I have just seen him.

33:47.775 --> 33:49.152
This is what happens
when you let someone--

33:49.235 --> 33:51.571
I didn't<i> let </i>anybody tow my car away.

33:51.654 --> 33:53.740
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Bobby,
what, you got tow problems?

33:53.823 --> 33:57.702
-Yeah.
-Why didn't you say something? (chuckles)

33:59.370 --> 34:04.459
(coughs) Now, that's, uh,
Kimiski's on 137th, right?

34:05.501 --> 34:08.337
-Uh, yeah.
-(dialing)

34:09.255 --> 34:10.089
(sniffles)

34:11.591 --> 34:14.761
Hey, Stick. Sal. Yeah.

34:15.803 --> 34:19.515
(chuckles) Listen, uh, I got a friend
whose car's tied up at your place.

34:19.766 --> 34:20.933
Yeah, it's a...

34:21.017 --> 34:22.351
-Camaro--
-Shut up!

34:22.727 --> 34:28.149
-A Camaro '81. Blue. 142OHG.
-BENEDETTO: Yeah, you got that?

34:28.441 --> 34:31.152
Uh-huh. Yeah.
I want you to cancel the papers on that

34:31.235 --> 34:33.279
and get it over
to Hill Street station. Yeah.

34:34.822 --> 34:36.949
Look, slobface, you don't give me that.

34:37.366 --> 34:40.328
I want to see the car parked out
in front in 20 minutes.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.663
And I want you to drive it
over here personally.

34:43.122 --> 34:45.583
Yeah, you got it. Yeah.

34:48.211 --> 34:50.171
-It's on the way.
-Thanks.

34:53.299 --> 34:54.342
All right. Let's move.

34:57.595 --> 34:58.471
Mm-hmm.

34:59.972 --> 35:02.767
Crockett's in the morgue under a John Doe.
We have a promise they'll keep him

35:02.850 --> 35:04.811
for as long as we need to finish
with Simone.

35:05.436 --> 35:07.146
Officer involved's going along so far.

35:09.565 --> 35:11.609
Yeah. Oh, come on, Jerry.

35:11.692 --> 35:14.529
I heard that song this morning.
Yes, we'll keep you informed.

35:16.823 --> 35:17.782
Captain.

35:19.700 --> 35:22.537
Bobby, I don't know why you borrowed
$400 from Mo Feldstein,

35:22.620 --> 35:24.580
but I'm obligated
to tell you three things:

35:24.664 --> 35:27.041
First, you're a party to a criminal act.

35:27.458 --> 35:30.128
Second, the fact that he's a loan shark
only makes the problem worse.

35:30.211 --> 35:32.672
And third, it's against
the rules of this precinct

35:32.755 --> 35:35.174
and my own ideas on how an officer
ought to conduct himself.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.343
Captain, I had some problems in my family.

35:37.426 --> 35:40.263
The-the bank wouldn't give me a buck,
and I-I had no other choice.

35:40.346 --> 35:43.099
I'm not kidding myself, Bobby.
I know cops go to shylocks.

35:43.432 --> 35:46.185
But they leave themselves and the force
open to coercion and blackmail.

35:46.477 --> 35:49.230
It was the first time,
and I wasn't going to do it again.

35:49.313 --> 35:53.359
Well, the second time's always a lot
easier and usually for a bigger amount.

35:55.653 --> 35:56.779
-I get the picture.
-Good.

35:56.863 --> 36:00.074
Because if it happens again,
I'm gonna have to let you go. That's all.

36:07.039 --> 36:09.834
OFFICER 1: Reggie. Reggie, these men are
gonna take you to county medical.

36:09.917 --> 36:12.044
I think you'll be more
comfortable down there.

36:13.462 --> 36:16.090
-(growling)
-(grunts)

36:17.425 --> 36:18.301
(both groan)

36:19.677 --> 36:20.803
(yells) Get away!

36:21.596 --> 36:23.890
-(groans)
-(growls)

36:27.268 --> 36:30.897
-RENKO: All right!
-Get away! Get away! Get away from me!

36:31.230 --> 36:34.108
-Get away from me! Get away! Get away!
-(glass shatters)

36:34.192 --> 36:35.151
Hold it!

36:35.526 --> 36:40.615
Get away! Get away! Get away!

36:40.698 --> 36:43.743
-RENKO: Easy.
-(growling)

36:43.826 --> 36:47.496
T.J.! T.J.! T.J.!

36:47.580 --> 36:50.708
Get away. Get away.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.339
Put the stick down, T.J.,
there's nowhere to go.

37:05.014 --> 37:10.394
(screams, panting)

37:17.026 --> 37:19.153
Oh, God. I'm so thirsty.

37:19.695 --> 37:21.864
Someone get him a glass of water. Okay.

37:21.948 --> 37:26.410
Oh, God! I'm so... thirsty.

37:32.291 --> 37:33.125
Here you go.

37:36.128 --> 37:39.590
(panting)

37:50.142 --> 37:55.314
Uh... T.J.'s dead.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.859
Uh, he drank poison.

38:00.278 --> 38:06.117
My name's Pete. I can't see.
I... I've been blind since birth.

38:08.369 --> 38:09.620
I know where the knife is.

38:10.788 --> 38:15.001
There's a loose board in the corridor.
It lifts up. The knife's underneath it.

38:16.836 --> 38:19.130
I heard T.J. put it under the board,
you see.

38:19.422 --> 38:22.758
He didn't realize that I could
hear him hiding the weapon.

38:28.597 --> 38:32.018
My name's Pete. And I can't see.

38:43.571 --> 38:44.405
Come on, Pete.

38:55.958 --> 38:58.627
Neal and that fat greaseball Benedetto
score a major coup.

38:58.711 --> 39:00.004
We get a walking tour of--

39:00.087 --> 39:02.506
Nobody said this was gonna be
<i>The French Connection, </i>LaRue.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.467
So let's just follow up the rest
of the tips and get it over with.

39:04.550 --> 39:07.887
Tips? You call these tips?
We got one self-confessed jaywalker,

39:07.970 --> 39:11.307
a guilt-ridden hairdresser
who stole a shopping cart five years ago.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.770
Oh, yeah. Don't forget the speed freak
with the hot lead

39:15.853 --> 39:18.105
-on the whereabouts of Patty Hearst.
-(engine starts)

39:19.357 --> 39:23.069
-Belker, what the hell are you eating?
-Bermuda onion and liverwurst.

39:23.152 --> 39:25.946
Yeah, well, it smells more like
Bermuda onion and dead rat.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.740
(scoffs) No wonder you work alone.

39:28.157 --> 39:30.534
Nobody in his right mind could stand
to be around you.

39:30.618 --> 39:31.619
Stop the car.

39:31.702 --> 39:34.038
What, over two hookers in a catfight?
Come on, you gotta be kidding.

39:34.121 --> 39:37.208
One of them's got a straight razor,
pus face. Stop the car.

39:38.209 --> 39:42.004
(shouting)

39:42.088 --> 39:44.131
(clamoring)

39:44.215 --> 39:45.633
-(overlapping dialog)
-Break it up!

39:45.716 --> 39:48.803
-...You have no right to park your trash!
-(screaming)

39:49.136 --> 39:52.014
-Break it up!
-Let her go! Let her go!

39:52.098 --> 39:52.973
Come on!

39:53.933 --> 39:55.601
-Get off!
-Drop the knife, sugar!

39:55.684 --> 39:58.354
-Drop it! Drop the knife!
-WOMAN 1: Hey!

39:59.480 --> 40:01.482
(grunts, groans)

40:01.565 --> 40:03.150
Drop it! Drop it!

40:03.859 --> 40:06.862
-(yelling in Spanish)
-Shut your face and move!

40:06.946 --> 40:08.197
(grunts)

40:09.115 --> 40:13.077
Oh. Belker! Look at this!

40:13.160 --> 40:18.833
200 bucks! I wore it twice.
You're gonna pay for it, you little twerp!

40:19.750 --> 40:20.668
(growls)

40:35.182 --> 40:38.727
Yeah. Yeah, I'm straight.

40:41.522 --> 40:42.398
I'm down.

40:43.482 --> 40:44.316
How's it feel?

40:45.317 --> 40:47.570
Feels like a-- like a train
ran over my head.

40:48.362 --> 40:50.865
LEO: Here, eat something.
Maybe you'll feel a little better.

40:52.992 --> 40:55.453
Hey, uh, you know something, Leo?

40:57.079 --> 41:01.709
(chuckles) Last time I was down was 1977.

41:03.169 --> 41:05.087
It's 1983.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.298
Yeah, right.

41:08.632 --> 41:13.137
Right. (shivering)

41:15.389 --> 41:18.517
Hey, this-- this ain't no day
at the beach, man.

41:18.601 --> 41:19.518
LEO: No, it's not.

41:19.852 --> 41:22.354
And staying straight's no picnic,
either, Rico.

41:25.441 --> 41:26.984
1983, man.

41:31.572 --> 41:34.950
I... I did it, didn't I?

41:35.409 --> 41:38.996
I'm clean, man. I want to thank you, bro.

41:39.830 --> 41:40.998
I want to thank you, Leo.

41:42.917 --> 41:43.751
Thank you, Leo.

41:45.753 --> 41:49.924
"Introduction. Paragraph 1.1.
Summary of functions and operations.

41:50.007 --> 41:53.719
The TK4600 is a motorized
prehensile tractor device

41:53.802 --> 41:58.265
capable of performing hazardous operations
independent of physical contact.

42:00.017 --> 42:02.937
Independent of physical contact."

42:04.813 --> 42:08.817
Oh... I don't understand it.

42:09.235 --> 42:12.279
I just can't open up around people.

42:12.738 --> 42:17.409
Inside I am bursting with affability,
affection, and good humor.

42:17.576 --> 42:21.914
But when it comes time
to show it, it just... dies.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.544
Oh, I don't know what to do.

42:28.963 --> 42:31.340
(whimpers)

42:31.632 --> 42:32.675
Looks like you and I are cut

42:32.758 --> 42:35.719
from the same block
of non-ferrous material, old pal.

42:36.595 --> 42:40.558
(on TV)<i> Doomed never to feel the warm,</i>
<i>sensitive touch of another human being.</i>

42:42.142 --> 42:45.229
<i>All I want is someone to be with.</i>

42:45.980 --> 42:47.606
<i>Is that asking too much?</i>

42:51.110 --> 42:54.154
-What do you know, Rollie?
-ROLLIE: I'm good, Mouse. How do you feel?

42:54.947 --> 42:58.242
I'm a sick man. I got, like, this, uh...

42:59.285 --> 43:01.412
This fist in the top of my stomach,
you know?

43:02.871 --> 43:04.873
Don't fool with it. Go get it looked at.

43:04.957 --> 43:07.126
(on radio)
<i>He looked at it. He gave me orders.</i>

43:07.209 --> 43:08.877
-ROLLIE:<i> Your doc?</i>
-MO:<i> What did I call you for?</i>

43:08.961 --> 43:10.796
I'm telling you, the doc ordered me.
I gotta get out.

43:10.879 --> 43:14.300
Calm down. Calm down. You said nothing.

43:14.842 --> 43:15.801
Mo's a little tight.

43:18.012 --> 43:21.348
Uh, I got $118,000 in paper.

43:22.808 --> 43:23.809
Make me a price.

43:25.227 --> 43:29.273
All my dough's on the street, Mo.
The best I can do is 15 cents on the buck.

43:31.191 --> 43:33.569
Then you're gonna give me 17
and change for $118,000?

43:33.652 --> 43:34.570
What are you, a sick man?

43:35.195 --> 43:36.363
I love it. (chuckles)

43:36.447 --> 43:38.741
ROLLIE:<i> I'm all on the street, Mo.</i>
<i>That's the best I can do.</i>

43:38.824 --> 43:43.245
-MO: I gotta get 60 cents. Come on.
-Twenty cents. Best I can do.

43:44.538 --> 43:47.499
Give me 40 cents and stop
being a sick individual.

43:48.584 --> 43:49.543
I can't make it, Mo.

43:52.630 --> 43:54.548
You know the last thing
my old man told me?

43:56.467 --> 43:59.053
Don't try to squeeze the last dollar
out of a situation.

43:59.136 --> 44:03.349
You make too many people mad. 20 cents.

44:03.724 --> 44:06.101
I'd rather stay sick
than stay in the trouble I'm in.

44:06.352 --> 44:08.520
-ROLLIE:<i> Twenty-five</i>
<i>-Twenty-eight.</i>

44:09.396 --> 44:11.774
26 cents and that's good night, Mouse.

44:13.192 --> 44:14.360
Come on, Mouse.

44:16.153 --> 44:20.032
(sighs) When do I get the cash?

44:26.872 --> 44:27.873
When I get the paper.

44:30.751 --> 44:31.919
I'll meet you in an hour.

44:32.795 --> 44:34.880
I hope you get a heart attack,
you guinea creep.

44:37.257 --> 44:39.009
(chuckles)

44:43.472 --> 44:45.599
-What's your name?
-Bill.

44:46.308 --> 44:50.938
-Nice name, Bill. You come here before?
-PHIL: No. Never.

44:52.439 --> 44:54.817
Well, Bill, you like oriental girls?

44:55.734 --> 44:56.944
Yes. Very much.

44:58.362 --> 45:00.364
Very feminine oriental girls.

45:01.782 --> 45:04.076
Indeed of the three great races.

45:04.159 --> 45:07.871
-The Asiatic is-- ah!
-No like feet?

45:08.497 --> 45:09.707
Like feet.

45:10.624 --> 45:13.168
Most tension in feet. Get out now.

45:15.462 --> 45:16.839
You Vietnamese?

45:17.756 --> 45:20.175
Yeah. How you know?

45:22.636 --> 45:25.681
I served in the army
for three years there.

45:27.933 --> 45:31.478
-I'm from Thanh Binh, near Da Nang.
-Really?

45:33.021 --> 45:34.773
I was stationed in Da Nang.

45:35.274 --> 45:38.527
You know "An Am Pearl" restaurant?
My mother used to work in there.

45:38.610 --> 45:42.281
-Your mother worked in An Am Pearl?
-COLETTE: Yeah.

45:43.657 --> 45:47.411
-Was your mother Sue?
-Not Sue. Mary.

45:47.828 --> 45:49.455
Still, that's amazing.

45:51.498 --> 45:52.666
What a world.

45:55.335 --> 45:57.838
-What's your name?
-Colette.

45:59.673 --> 46:03.051
-You want to do front side now?
-Colette.

46:05.929 --> 46:06.847
Well, Colette...

46:09.224 --> 46:11.935
Some days I miss Vietnam very much.

46:13.812 --> 46:14.897
I know. Me too.

46:17.107 --> 46:19.568
That was a country too beautiful
to have a war in.

46:22.446 --> 46:26.992
Do you remember those big, white birds
that used to fly over the rice fields

46:27.075 --> 46:29.995
-just before sunset?
-Yes.

46:30.954 --> 46:34.583
-PHIL: Do you know what kind they were?
-No.

46:36.418 --> 46:43.008
All I remember is they used to swoop
and glide. The whole group.

46:44.635 --> 46:47.596
And at that moment,
they were like the only sounds

46:47.679 --> 46:49.306
and movements in the world.

46:52.351 --> 46:56.438
I remember asking myself
"How could a country at war be so silent?"

46:58.690 --> 47:00.526
"How could it still have birds?"

47:10.702 --> 47:14.289
-What's the matter?
-(whines) So stupid.

47:16.959 --> 47:18.001
I'm homesick.

47:21.004 --> 47:24.258
Oh, I'd like to go back and conquer
that whole country for you, Colette.

47:24.800 --> 47:27.219
Beat those commie geeks back to Hanoi.

47:29.179 --> 47:33.183
(thunder rumbles)

47:45.988 --> 47:46.864
(car door closes)

47:51.577 --> 47:53.203
What do you want from me now, Sal?

47:55.706 --> 47:59.585
You ripped my nose off,
deprived me of my livelihood,

48:00.085 --> 48:03.797
now you're calling me at two o'clock
at night. What's left?

48:04.798 --> 48:07.718
-You wanna break my heart.
-I want to apologize, Mo.

48:09.136 --> 48:12.431
Good. 'Cause you owe me.

48:14.057 --> 48:16.476
I took a-a blood bath today.

48:17.561 --> 48:20.772
I didn't even clear enough to pay
for the plane ticket to Miami.

48:21.648 --> 48:23.233
Mo, don't worry about a thing.

48:33.535 --> 48:37.706
(closing theme playing)
