* Love and marriage *

00:20.969 --> 00:22.734
* Go together like *

00:22.769 --> 00:25.200
* A horse and carriage *

00:25.235 --> 00:29.200
* This I tell ya, brother *

00:29.235 --> 00:31.133
* You can't have one *

00:31.168 --> 00:34.033
* Without the other *

00:34.068 --> 00:38.934
* Love and marriage *

00:38.969 --> 00:40.334
* It's an institute *

00:40.369 --> 00:42.734
* You can't disparage *

00:42.769 --> 00:46.501
* Ask the local gentry *

00:46.536 --> 00:51.067
* And they will say
It's elementary *

00:51.102 --> 00:55.868
* Try, try, try
To separate them *

00:55.903 --> 00:59.567
* It's an illusion *

00:59.602 --> 01:04.700
* Try, try, try
And you will only come *

01:04.736 --> 01:08.133
* To this conclusion *

01:08.168 --> 01:10.234
* Love and marriage **

<i>Excuse me, Mr. Bosley.
Isn't this demeaning?</i>

01:19.569 --> 01:22.300
<i>Demeaning?
Demeaning, Patsy?</i>

01:22.335 --> 01:25.801
<i>Is it demeaning for a woman
to serve a man?</i>

01:25.836 --> 01:27.734
<i>What do you
think, girls?</i>

01:27.769 --> 01:29.067
<i>No.
No.</i>

01:29.102 --> 01:31.133
<i>Now, everybody,
let's get started.</i>

01:32.736 --> 01:34.067
What you watching?

01:34.102 --> 01:36.934
Patsy: Portrait of a Stewardess
in Training.

01:39.234 --> 01:41.234
<i>Mr. Bosley!</i>

01:41.269 --> 01:44.767
<i>And I thought that was
a flotation device.</i>

01:46.901 --> 01:49.901
Oh, Al. Why do you
watch these things?

01:49.936 --> 01:51.868
It's educational, Peg.

01:51.903 --> 01:55.033
I mean, we all fly,
but do any of us really know

01:55.068 --> 01:56.701
what these young
ladies go through

01:56.736 --> 01:57.801
to become stewardesses?

02:00.434 --> 02:01.467
Ooh.

02:03.434 --> 02:05.767
Their dresses
are awfully short.

02:05.802 --> 02:09.267
Would you like me
to get one of those?

02:09.301 --> 02:10.300
Why?

02:13.302 --> 02:14.601
Get that, hon.

02:14.636 --> 02:15.934
I'd be honored, Al.

02:15.969 --> 02:16.801
Shh!

02:20.434 --> 02:22.434
I hope we're
not interrupting.

02:22.469 --> 02:24.434
Oh, no. Come on in.

02:24.469 --> 02:26.367
I was just making coffee.

02:26.402 --> 02:29.367
Al's watching Gullible Girls
Week on Channel 3.

02:29.402 --> 02:31.934
Al, we have company.

02:35.234 --> 02:37.100
It's Steve
and Marcie.

02:40.734 --> 02:44.734
If a maniac broke in this house
right now and shot me dead,

02:44.769 --> 02:46.534
Al wouldn't even know.

02:46.569 --> 02:48.033
I'd know.

02:49.667 --> 02:52.634
I can't believe
you let your husband watch

02:52.669 --> 02:54.501
this mindless
exploitation of women.

02:54.536 --> 02:56.868
It's not mindless.

02:56.903 --> 02:59.033
Come on, Marcie.
You want coffee and cake?

02:59.068 --> 03:00.033
Sure.

03:00.068 --> 03:01.367
Good.
Did you bring cake?

03:01.402 --> 03:02.367
No.

03:02.402 --> 03:03.801
Well, we'll use ours.

03:03.836 --> 03:05.334
Hey, Al,
doesn't it bother you

03:05.369 --> 03:08.400
to watch this kind of smut
in front of your wife?

03:08.435 --> 03:10.234
Yeah.

03:10.269 --> 03:12.234
You know what
we learned last Tuesday

03:12.269 --> 03:14.234
in Marcie's
women's club meeting?

03:14.269 --> 03:16.334
I don't care.

03:16.369 --> 03:18.334
You can't
honestly tell me

03:18.369 --> 03:19.801
you don't
enjoy watching this.

03:19.836 --> 03:21.300
I mean,
look at that leg

03:21.335 --> 03:23.300
draped over that
flotation device.

03:23.335 --> 03:25.167
You don't find
that pleasurable?

03:26.834 --> 03:29.000
I used to love smut.

03:30.300 --> 03:33.300
Oh, wait a second, Al.
We went through this before.

03:33.335 --> 03:35.234
You got me
in a lot of trouble.

03:35.269 --> 03:37.267
Damn it, Steve,
we're men.

03:37.302 --> 03:38.767
It's our
God given right

03:38.802 --> 03:40.767
to watch
sports and smut.

03:40.802 --> 03:43.400
Since when do we have
to apologize for that?

03:43.435 --> 03:45.267
I think since the '70s.

03:46.834 --> 03:48.434
Cake?

03:48.469 --> 03:49.734
No, thanks.

03:49.769 --> 03:53.434
Doesn't it bother you that
he watches things like that?

03:53.469 --> 03:54.767
Not really.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.367
I couldn't stand it.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.767
Men shouldn't look at women
like pieces of meat.

03:58.802 --> 04:00.267
Well, what actually
bothers me

04:00.302 --> 04:02.767
is that he doesn't
look at me

04:02.802 --> 04:05.267
like a piece
of meat anymore.

04:05.302 --> 04:07.767
He used to,
but it's been 16 years,

04:07.802 --> 04:09.634
and I guess it's hard
to stay interested.

04:09.669 --> 04:11.067
That's ridiculous.

04:11.102 --> 04:13.801
If they can follow the same
sports team all their lives,

04:13.836 --> 04:16.868
they can stay interested
in the same woman.

04:16.903 --> 04:18.367
In our women's group,

04:18.402 --> 04:21.367
we have a couple
married 47 years.

04:21.402 --> 04:24.167
They still fool around
four times a week.

04:27.033 --> 04:28.234
A week?

04:31.534 --> 04:35.400
Al doesn't even brush his teeth
four times a week.

04:39.534 --> 04:43.601
You know, maybe Al just doesn't
find me attractive anymore.

04:43.636 --> 04:45.234
What would you say
if I told you

04:45.269 --> 04:47.133
I had the answer
to all your problems?

04:47.168 --> 04:48.467
I don't know.

04:48.502 --> 04:52.000
I bought one of those,
and it's just not the same.

04:58.067 --> 04:59.567
Not that.

04:59.602 --> 05:01.567
I've been
reading this book,

05:01.602 --> 05:03.567
<i>Thinnergy For Thinness
And Energy.</i>

05:03.602 --> 05:04.567
A diet?

05:04.602 --> 05:06.567
Oh, it's more
than just a diet.

05:06.602 --> 05:07.868
It's a way of life.

05:07.903 --> 05:09.367
Certain foods
add to your energy,

05:09.402 --> 05:12.367
while other bad foods
can actually drain your energy.

05:12.402 --> 05:15.100
This book helps you
eliminate the bad foods.

05:15.135 --> 05:16.868
You wake up
with energy.

05:16.903 --> 05:20.067
You go to bed
with energy.

05:22.267 --> 05:24.267
What foods
drain your energy?

05:24.302 --> 05:26.701
Hey, Peg, we got
any more chips?

05:26.736 --> 05:28.868
Potato chips
are draining.

05:28.903 --> 05:29.901
No, Al.

05:31.701 --> 05:33.667
You really ought
to give it a try.

05:33.702 --> 05:37.167
You'll radiate an aura
of energy and sexuality

05:37.202 --> 05:39.868
that even Al
can't resist.

05:39.903 --> 05:43.334
I can only tell you
it worked for me.

05:43.369 --> 05:46.868
How well did it
work for you?

05:46.903 --> 05:50.234
Every 36 hours.

05:55.601 --> 05:57.267
Whoo!

05:57.302 --> 05:58.801
There he is.

05:58.836 --> 06:02.000
My little
Mount St. Helens.

06:08.234 --> 06:09.567
Steve...
Hm?

06:09.602 --> 06:11.234
I think we should
go home now

06:11.269 --> 06:12.901
and go to bed.

06:12.936 --> 06:14.400
I don't know.

06:14.435 --> 06:16.567
I don't really
feel like it.

06:16.602 --> 06:18.434
Come on, Steve.
Let's go.

06:18.469 --> 06:20.734
Well, if you're gonna
go to bed,

06:20.769 --> 06:23.234
I think I'll stay up
and watch some PBS.

06:23.269 --> 06:25.701
Al, what channel does PBS
come on in this neighborhood?

06:25.736 --> 06:27.200
Thank you.

06:27.235 --> 06:30.033
Did you talk
any sense into Al?

06:30.068 --> 06:31.901
I don't
think so, Patsy.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.074

06:42.534 --> 06:44.200
Isn't this over yet?

06:44.235 --> 06:47.234
Almost. They're
cramming for finals.

06:51.534 --> 06:55.067
Al, don't you think those girls
are a little skinny?

06:55.102 --> 06:57.868
You know, shouldn't a woman
have some meat on her bones?

06:57.903 --> 07:01.033
You have to have something
to grab onto.

07:01.068 --> 07:03.667
I don't know, Peg. A lot of guys
have been grabbing that one,

07:03.702 --> 07:06.367
and nobody's missed yet.

07:08.801 --> 07:13.467
* I'm in the mood for... *

07:17.168 --> 07:18.968
* Love *

07:19.003 --> 07:23.801
* Bum, ba, da, dum
Da, da, da *

07:23.836 --> 07:25.667
* Hmm
Ba, da, da... *

07:27.133 --> 07:29.968
Al! Al, are you
coming up?

07:30.003 --> 07:31.501
In a minute.

07:31.536 --> 07:32.868
Okay.

07:32.903 --> 07:35.234
* Bum, ba, da, dum *

07:37.234 --> 07:38.467
Ew.

07:44.267 --> 07:45.567
Al!

07:45.602 --> 07:46.601
In a minute!

07:46.636 --> 07:50.133
* In a minute
Just a minute **

08:18.968 --> 08:20.467
Bud, this could be

08:20.502 --> 08:23.801
the end of life
as we know it.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.801
Oh, don't worry
about it, Kel.

08:25.836 --> 08:28.267
If you think Dad's gonna
put up with this diet,

08:28.302 --> 08:31.501
they should've held you back
another grade.

08:34.501 --> 08:35.833
Oh, that's him.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.501
Oh, wow! His sweat stains
are giant,

08:42.535 --> 08:46.000
and he hasn't even
said hi to Mom yet.

08:46.035 --> 08:48.300
This is gonna
be great.

08:50.334 --> 08:52.334
Hi, Dad. Hungry?

08:52.369 --> 08:54.400
Starving. I didn't
have time for lunch,

08:54.435 --> 08:56.000
got caught
in a traffic jam,

08:56.035 --> 08:58.701
and had to sit for 10 minutes
staring at a billboard

08:58.736 --> 09:01.100
of the best looking burger
on the rope I've ever seen.

09:01.135 --> 09:02.868
Let's eat.

09:02.903 --> 09:04.033
Hi, hon.

09:04.068 --> 09:05.934
Hi, Al. I made
something different.

09:05.969 --> 09:07.067
I don't care.

09:07.102 --> 09:09.267
Just slide it in front of me,
and plenty of it.

09:09.302 --> 09:11.734
Okay. Here it comes.

09:13.534 --> 09:15.367
I'll just skip
the salad.

09:15.402 --> 09:16.534
Let's just eat, okay?

09:16.569 --> 09:17.701
That's dinner, Al.

09:17.736 --> 09:19.200
You've got
your riboflavin,

09:19.235 --> 09:22.067
folacin, iron and magnesium,
all right there.

09:24.534 --> 09:27.334
Come on, Peg.
Where's my food?

09:27.369 --> 09:28.501
That's it, Al.

09:28.536 --> 09:29.868
You finish that,

09:29.903 --> 09:33.300
and you can have a granola bar
for dessert.

09:33.335 --> 09:37.033
Ooh, beats the heck out of the
pie we usually have, huh, Dad?

09:37.068 --> 09:38.901
Okay, Peg.
What did I do?

09:38.936 --> 09:40.400
Nothing.
It's good food.

09:40.435 --> 09:42.834
It's going to make us
much healthier

09:42.869 --> 09:44.367
and much more energetic.

09:44.402 --> 09:45.367
Try it.

09:46.501 --> 09:47.534
Sure.

09:54.334 --> 09:56.334
Gee, you know,
you're right.

09:56.369 --> 09:57.834
I doubted you,

09:57.869 --> 10:00.834
but I feel
a burst of energy coming.

10:00.869 --> 10:02.534
Here it comes now.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.601
Here comes another wave.

10:07.636 --> 10:10.334
What are you doing to me?
I work. I want food.

10:10.369 --> 10:11.534
You know what food is?

10:11.569 --> 10:13.200
It's hot stuff
you put in your mouth.

10:13.235 --> 10:15.601
It smells good, you swallow it,
and you want more.

10:15.636 --> 10:17.000
That's what food is.

10:17.035 --> 10:18.534
Al, the children are here.

10:18.569 --> 10:19.901
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:25.067 --> 10:26.868
Now, I'm gonna watch the news.

10:26.903 --> 10:28.167
And when it's over,

10:28.202 --> 10:30.300
I want some form
of dead animal on my plate.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.834
<i>And the melted cheese
marries itself</i>

10:34.869 --> 10:38.033
<i>to the juices
of this succulent steak.</i>

10:38.068 --> 10:40.534
And I want
that dead animal

10:40.569 --> 10:42.300
to be succulent, Peg.

10:42.335 --> 10:45.567
We have nothing succulent, Al.
I threw it all out.

10:45.602 --> 10:47.400
You threw away my food?

10:47.435 --> 10:49.634
That I love, that I pay for?

10:49.669 --> 10:51.934
Kids, I think you ought
to go upstairs for a while.

10:51.969 --> 10:54.367
Mom, we would, but we
don't have the energy.

10:54.402 --> 10:55.901
Get upstairs!

10:58.200 --> 11:00.200
You were saying
that you threw out my food?

11:00.235 --> 11:02.868
Excuse me for trying to improve
the quality of our lives.

11:02.903 --> 11:05.067
You're excused.
Now, give me meat.

11:05.102 --> 11:06.734
Al, I am going on this diet.

11:06.769 --> 11:08.534
If you don't want to,
you don't have to.

11:08.569 --> 11:10.634
I don't want to.
You're going on this diet.

11:10.669 --> 11:11.968
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

11:12.003 --> 11:13.601
Oh, no, I'm not.
Oh, yes, you are.

11:13.636 --> 11:14.667
I can't believe it.

11:14.702 --> 11:16.567
This is all
just happening

11:16.602 --> 11:18.067
because Mom
wants affection.

11:18.102 --> 11:21.934
Then why doesn't she just go
to the mall, like you?

11:35.334 --> 11:36.467
You know...

11:36.502 --> 11:39.767
this carrot is delicious.

11:39.802 --> 11:42.767
Did you know that carrots
have a natural sweetness?

11:42.802 --> 11:45.634
It's much better
than what you're eating.

11:47.234 --> 11:48.734
And this water here?

11:48.769 --> 11:51.234
It comes
from a natural spring.

11:51.269 --> 11:52.734
It is the perfect
complement

11:52.769 --> 11:55.734
to the natural sweetness
of this carrot.

11:55.769 --> 11:59.167
I guess that's why
I feel so good.

11:59.202 --> 12:01.100
What do you kids
want for supper?

12:01.135 --> 12:02.400
Pizza.

12:02.435 --> 12:04.000
With meatballs.

12:04.035 --> 12:05.367
I'm having grapefruit.

12:06.534 --> 12:07.901
With water.

12:07.936 --> 12:10.567
Natural spring water.

12:13.434 --> 12:15.701
Get out.

12:27.634 --> 12:28.767
Hey, Luke.

12:28.802 --> 12:30.100
Hey, Al.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.968
Hey, Al, let me
ask you a question.

12:35.003 --> 12:37.000
If you came home at night

12:37.035 --> 12:38.968
and found your wife
in bed with another guy,

12:39.003 --> 12:40.400
would you get mad?

12:40.435 --> 12:42.100
I'd kill him.

12:42.135 --> 12:43.534
Oh...

12:43.569 --> 12:46.234
So I guess this guy
didn't overreact.

12:46.269 --> 12:49.434
You look a little
peaked, Al, babe.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.434
All-night romp
with the little lady?

12:51.469 --> 12:52.834
More or less.

12:52.869 --> 12:55.200
She's been yelling at me
since 1:00 this morning.

12:55.235 --> 12:56.968
Yeah, she's on
some stupid diet.

12:57.003 --> 12:58.667
I guess
it makes them moody.

12:58.702 --> 13:00.300
Well, I can't
sympathize.

13:00.335 --> 13:01.801
There's a shock.

13:01.836 --> 13:05.534
See, I can eat whatever I want
and never gain a pound.

13:05.569 --> 13:08.534
My body's great.
I can abuse it

13:08.569 --> 13:11.467
and it keeps
coming back for more.

13:11.502 --> 13:13.701
Hey, you know what else
is great about me?

13:13.736 --> 13:14.567
Shut up.

13:15.834 --> 13:17.834
Can someone
help me, please?

13:17.869 --> 13:18.934
Yes, miss.

13:18.969 --> 13:21.167
The modeling agency's
a few doors down.

13:21.202 --> 13:23.801
Oh, no,
I'm not a model.

13:23.836 --> 13:25.601
I just need shoes.

13:25.636 --> 13:27.133
Ho, ho. My mistake.

13:27.168 --> 13:28.634
Let me help you.

13:28.669 --> 13:30.000
Sit right here.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.601
Al! Al! Hi, uh...

13:35.636 --> 13:38.133
Listen,
I haven't got much time.

13:38.168 --> 13:40.033
I'm on my break.

13:40.068 --> 13:43.200
Do you remember that movie we
were watching the other night?

13:43.235 --> 13:46.334
<i>Patsy: Portrait
of a Stewardess in Training.</i>

13:46.369 --> 13:48.033
Thank you.
Wait a second.

13:48.068 --> 13:49.701
I got to ask you
a question.

13:49.736 --> 13:51.868
Look, I've only got
five more minutes on my break.

13:51.903 --> 13:53.367
I gotta get
to the tape store.

13:53.402 --> 13:54.701
This'll only
take a second.

13:54.736 --> 13:57.234
Your wife
gave my wife a book.

13:57.269 --> 13:59.234
Now my life is hell.

13:59.269 --> 14:01.534
<i>A-ha. Thinnergy.</i>

14:01.569 --> 14:03.567
Yeah, that's the one.
Does Marcie hate me that much?

14:03.602 --> 14:05.234
Well, yes, Al, she does,

14:05.269 --> 14:08.467
but that's not why
she gave Peggy the book.

14:08.502 --> 14:09.901
It was to help you guys.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.067
And you are looking thinner.

14:11.102 --> 14:13.400
I'm not on
the stupid diet.

14:13.435 --> 14:15.834
Ooh, Al, you have to.

14:15.869 --> 14:18.334
She can't go
through this alone.

14:18.369 --> 14:21.200
She needs support.
Your support, big guy.

14:23.701 --> 14:26.701
If you were to try this diet
for even one week,

14:26.736 --> 14:28.701
you would show her
that you care.

14:28.736 --> 14:30.634
Then if you were both on it,

14:30.669 --> 14:33.133
you could go
off it together.

14:33.168 --> 14:34.968
Together is the key word, Al.

14:35.003 --> 14:38.467
So all I gotta do is starve
and be miserable for a week,

14:38.502 --> 14:43.133
then my life will go back to
the normal hell it always was?

14:43.168 --> 14:45.367
I firmly believe that, Al.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.667
See, today's
woman is strong,

14:48.702 --> 14:52.701
but now and then, even she
needs a little assurance.

14:52.736 --> 14:55.100
Hey, guys,
come here a second.

14:55.135 --> 14:57.234
Sandy's on her way
to a job interview.

14:57.269 --> 14:59.100
She's a little
self-conscious.

14:59.135 --> 15:01.701
Can you tell
she's not wearing a bra?

15:05.868 --> 15:08.100
No, I can't tell.
No.

15:13.534 --> 15:17.434
I can't believe he's been
on this diet two days.

15:17.469 --> 15:19.467
Yep. Two days, 10 fights,

15:19.502 --> 15:22.667
and they haven't even
got to radish day yet.

15:22.702 --> 15:26.267
I really hate
to see them like this.

15:26.302 --> 15:28.767
Then why don't you try
and talk some sense into them.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.267
They'll listen to you.

15:30.302 --> 15:31.367
Yeah.

15:31.402 --> 15:33.133
That's worth a try.

15:36.367 --> 15:38.033
Mom, Dad-

15:38.068 --> 15:40.234
You're grounded.

15:41.868 --> 15:45.167
Well, I'm going out now.
See you, Kel.

15:45.202 --> 15:46.667
I'm hungry too,

15:46.702 --> 15:49.968
but you don't see me
biting anyone's head off!

15:52.300 --> 15:54.300
More kale, dear?

15:56.167 --> 15:58.567
Did I ask
for more kale?

15:59.901 --> 16:01.300
More broccoli?

16:01.335 --> 16:03.767
Did I ask
for more broccoli?

16:05.234 --> 16:07.567
You know, Al,
the book says

16:07.602 --> 16:09.033
we're gonna go through
grouchy periods

16:09.068 --> 16:10.734
as the toxins
leave our bodies.

16:10.769 --> 16:14.234
Yours, of course,
has a longer trip than mine.

16:14.269 --> 16:16.834
But anyway,
the book says

16:16.869 --> 16:18.801
that when we feel
an argument coming on,

16:18.836 --> 16:21.367
we are supposed to stop
and share a nice memory.

16:27.434 --> 16:28.601
Hey...

16:28.636 --> 16:31.601
Remember that time
when we were dating,

16:31.636 --> 16:33.601
and we
took that walk

16:33.636 --> 16:35.968
on Oak Street Beach
at sunset?

16:38.200 --> 16:41.200
The wind was blowing
through your hair,

16:41.235 --> 16:42.767
and you got cold,

16:42.802 --> 16:45.567
so I gave you back
your jacket.

16:48.434 --> 16:50.434
And we fed
the pigeons...

16:50.469 --> 16:52.434
and held hands.

16:52.469 --> 16:54.968
We watched
the moon come up.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.801
Oh, yeah.

17:05.467 --> 17:07.334
More kale, dear?

17:10.467 --> 17:13.032
You wanna watch Carson?

17:13.068 --> 17:14.634
It's a special show.

17:14.669 --> 17:16.934
It's a repeat of his salute
to Charles Nelson Reilly.

17:18.133 --> 17:20.634
Al, did I
ever tell you

17:20.669 --> 17:24.400
the sound of your voice
irritates the hell out of me?

17:24.435 --> 17:26.133
No, honey, you didn't.

17:26.167 --> 17:28.434
In that case, there's only
one thing I'll have to do.

17:28.469 --> 17:30.267
I'll just have
to shut up.

17:30.302 --> 17:32.267
Yep, I'll just
have to be quiet,

17:32.302 --> 17:34.300
because if there's one thing
I don't want to do,

17:34.335 --> 17:35.667
it's irritate you.

17:35.702 --> 17:37.667
Not my little Peggy.

17:37.702 --> 17:39.167
Because
if she's irritated,

17:39.202 --> 17:40.667
then I'm irritated,

17:40.702 --> 17:43.667
and if she's unhappy,
then I'm unhappy.

17:43.702 --> 17:46.534
Al, sweetie,
what's that song you hate?

17:47.667 --> 17:50.100
Don't do it, Peg.

17:50.135 --> 17:52.100
* See the tree
How big it's grown *

17:52.135 --> 17:53.200
No, Peg, please.

17:53.235 --> 17:54.934
* Friend,
It hasn't been too long *

17:54.969 --> 17:56.667
* It wasn't big *
All right.

17:56.702 --> 17:58.667
* I laughed at her
And she got mad *

17:58.702 --> 18:00.601
* The first day
That she planted it *

18:00.636 --> 18:02.701
* It was just a twig *

18:02.736 --> 18:04.200
* And honey- *

18:04.235 --> 18:05.734
Ugh.

18:05.769 --> 18:08.567
* And honey
I miss you *

18:08.602 --> 18:10.734
* And I'm being good *

18:10.769 --> 18:13.033
* And I'd love
To be with you *

18:13.068 --> 18:15.300
* If only I could **

18:20.234 --> 18:22.234
* I am woman
Hear me roar *

18:22.269 --> 18:24.400
* In numbers
Too big to ignore *

18:24.435 --> 18:26.067
* And I've gone
much too far- **

18:26.102 --> 18:27.567
All right! You win!

18:27.602 --> 18:30.167
It's a low blow,
but you win.

18:39.767 --> 18:41.767
* Dominique, nique, nique *

18:41.802 --> 18:43.267
* Over land
She walks along **

18:43.302 --> 18:44.767
Peg! You won.

18:44.802 --> 18:47.634
There's no need
to spike the ball.

18:50.701 --> 18:53.200
You've been acting
very snippy lately.

18:53.235 --> 18:54.434
Have I?

18:54.469 --> 18:57.234
Yep, and I think
I know what you need.

18:57.269 --> 18:58.934
Oh, really?
Uh-huh.

18:58.969 --> 19:02.467
Something that always
makes you feel better.

19:02.502 --> 19:05.701
Why don't you make
yourself comfortable?

19:05.736 --> 19:07.200
Right here.

19:07.235 --> 19:08.701
That's right.

19:08.736 --> 19:10.567
Lie down.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.601
I'll be right back.

19:16.033 --> 19:18.100
Don't go away.

19:25.334 --> 19:26.801
* In a minute *

19:26.836 --> 19:28.133
* Just a min- **

19:43.167 --> 19:44.934
Close your eyes,
honey.

19:51.534 --> 19:52.534
Eat it!

19:52.569 --> 19:54.067
Eat it all!

19:54.102 --> 19:55.000
Eat it!

19:56.534 --> 19:59.067
Oh, Al,
that's disgusting.

20:00.534 --> 20:01.901
Mmm.

20:03.534 --> 20:06.534
Al, this is not
what I wanted.

20:06.569 --> 20:08.033
You ruined everything.

20:08.068 --> 20:09.534
What do you mean,
ruined everything?

20:09.569 --> 20:11.000
Our lives
are already ruined.

20:11.035 --> 20:12.267
Give me some of that.

20:12.302 --> 20:13.467
Get your own.

20:16.534 --> 20:19.567
Peg, I don't know why
you went on a diet anyway.

20:19.602 --> 20:22.067
You don't need
to lose any weight.

20:22.102 --> 20:24.067
I had to do something.

20:24.102 --> 20:26.567
You don't find me
attractive anymore.

20:26.602 --> 20:27.934
So?

20:29.567 --> 20:32.567
So? So you don't find me
attractive anymore?

20:32.602 --> 20:34.067
Oh, gee, Peg,
of course I do.

20:34.102 --> 20:36.067
I think you're
great-looking.

20:36.102 --> 20:39.067
Then why haven't we,
uh...you know?

20:39.102 --> 20:41.567
It's been
a long time, Al.

20:41.602 --> 20:43.067
Aw, honey.
That again.

20:43.102 --> 20:45.234
Come here a second,
will you?

20:45.269 --> 20:47.567
Let me
tell you something.

20:47.602 --> 20:49.801
Now, just because I don't
go to bed with you

20:49.836 --> 20:52.033
doesn't mean
I don't love you.

20:52.068 --> 20:53.534
I mean, let's face it,

20:53.569 --> 20:58.534
even if you were beautiful
like that girl on TV,

20:58.569 --> 21:00.400
I'd still ignore you...

21:02.534 --> 21:04.033
because you're my wife.

21:04.068 --> 21:06.033
Don't stiffen on me, Peg.

21:06.068 --> 21:09.033
Let me tell you
what I mean.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.667
You remember
that baseball glove

21:11.702 --> 21:14.534
my dad gave me
when I was a little kid?

21:14.569 --> 21:16.033
I loved that glove.

21:16.068 --> 21:19.033
Yeah, it's old,
and the web's loose,

21:19.068 --> 21:21.901
but it's special to me.

21:23.534 --> 21:26.801
That's how I feel
about you, Peg.

21:29.667 --> 21:32.567
I may not tell you
all the time,

21:32.602 --> 21:33.868
but I love you.

21:35.067 --> 21:38.067
I wouldn't do anything
to change you.

21:38.102 --> 21:41.934
I think you're great
just the way you are.

21:48.067 --> 21:49.868
So is my glove.

21:51.501 --> 21:55.501
I'll have to take it out more
and play catch with Bud.

21:55.536 --> 21:58.400
Oh, I like that.
Oh, that feels good.

22:00.033 --> 22:02.901
Hey, remember the American
League play-offs last year?

22:05.534 --> 22:09.534
You know, a lot of fly balls
were popping out of gloves

22:09.569 --> 22:11.033
for home runs.

22:11.068 --> 22:14.901
I think it's because
the modern gloves are too big.

22:16.534 --> 22:19.534
That never would have
happened to Willie Mays.

22:19.569 --> 22:21.033
Know why?

22:21.068 --> 22:22.901
Willie had a small glove.

22:25.534 --> 22:27.901
Just like mine.
