I've been worried sick. I've
been knocking and knocking.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.590
You see, I had a parcel for Laura.

02:03.640 --> 02:08.110
They delivered it to me because
she didn't answer the door.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.600
OK, thank you.

03:27.720 --> 03:29.360
- Yeah, it's 15.
- Guv.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.630
Guv? Guv?

03:48.680 --> 03:51.590
Bancroft has put Andy
Bevan on the Kamara Op.

03:51.640 --> 03:54.110
When will I go proactive?
I'm always sat at my desk.

03:54.160 --> 03:58.030
Do you know what Stalin said about how
he got to the top of the Communist party?

03:58.080 --> 04:02.510
I mean, obviously he was a paranoid,
murdering tyrant, but it's good advice.

04:02.560 --> 04:06.560
He said, "I took the minutes."

04:08.240 --> 04:11.110
Never underestimate the power
of the desk job, Katherine.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.320
I've got something for you. Cold Cases.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.470
Commissioner wants us
to boost clear-up rates.

04:16.519 --> 04:19.589
Solve a few of them, you'll fly
past Andy Bevan at the next review.

04:19.640 --> 04:22.320
- They're yours to be getting on with.
- Thanks, guv.

04:23.720 --> 04:26.150
- And Katherine?
- Yeah?

04:26.200 --> 04:28.390
Calm down.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.720
You see injustice where there isn't any.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.840
What's going on? Athif
should be here by now.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.350
Eyes up. We're on, guv.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.200
Suspect in sight. Standby.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.390
Andy, Athif's in the car
park. Stay on your toes.

06:10.440 --> 06:12.600
♪ Everything is changing ♪

06:25.720 --> 06:27.350
That's not him. That's not Athif.

06:27.400 --> 06:30.310
- Who's that?
- It's his brother, Daanish.

06:30.360 --> 06:31.720
So where's Athif?

06:39.560 --> 06:41.260
Guv, they're not going to hang about.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.430
- Go.
- Strike, strike, strike!

06:46.480 --> 06:47.870
- Go, go, go!
- Armed police!

06:47.920 --> 06:48.920
Stand still!

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
- Let me see your hands!
- Move it!

06:57.280 --> 06:59.150
- Straight ahead!
- Let me see your hands!

06:59.200 --> 07:01.710
- Keep moving! - Show me your
hands! Show me your hands!

07:01.760 --> 07:03.830
Stand still! Stand fucking still!

07:03.880 --> 07:06.550
- Down, now!
- Keep your hands above your head!

07:10.480 --> 07:12.320
See you later, Becky!

07:13.360 --> 07:16.320
- A girl's just gone out the fire exit.
- Yeah, well, stop her.

07:21.200 --> 07:21.890
Stop!

07:22.440 --> 07:24.120
Police! Stay where you are!

07:25.080 --> 07:26.750
Keep your hands above your head!

07:26.800 --> 07:30.510
- Get back! Get back now!
Get back, I said! - Help me!

07:30.560 --> 07:33.280
- Idiot! - OK, George,
you're in charge in here.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.670
- Put the gun down! Put it down!
- Stand still!

07:36.720 --> 07:40.390
- Let the girl go!
- Get off! Get off me!

07:40.440 --> 07:42.150
Take the shot when you have the chance.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.990
- Move or I'll fucking shoot her!
- Put the gun down, Daanish.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.360
Put it down. You don't want to hurt her.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.520
- Come on.
- Please get off me!

07:53.320 --> 07:55.880
- Please! - Wasn't even
your drop, was it? Eh?

07:59.720 --> 08:01.720
- Please!
- It was Athif's.

08:03.760 --> 08:04.840
Where is he?

08:06.240 --> 08:08.240
You've been set up by your own brother.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.750
- Drop the weapon!
- Get back!

08:13.800 --> 08:15.440
- I said move back now!
- Now!

08:18.040 --> 08:21.310
- DS Stevens?
- Yes?

08:21.360 --> 08:24.110
I'm Anya Karim, Forensics.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.440
- Super's got me on
the cold cases. - Oh.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.840
- Is this one of them?
- Yeah.

08:31.480 --> 08:34.520
- How long has she been dead?
- 27 years.

08:36.520 --> 08:40.200
Good. Killers didn't think about
what they left behind back then.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.640
Yeah, great. Take it away.

08:46.480 --> 08:50.430
- How are you doing?
- What if you hadn't come?

08:50.480 --> 08:53.630
Life's full of ifs. You're all
right. That's the main thing.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.870
You had to do one thing -- watch the exit.

08:55.920 --> 08:58.080
- Guv, I'm sorry.
- Just leave it.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.670
- Does it hurt?
- What do you think?

09:01.720 --> 09:04.590
I did you a favour. Kill her, you're
finished. Why isn't Athif here?

09:04.640 --> 09:07.200
- Ask him.
- Yeah, I might just do that.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.790
Hey.

09:11.840 --> 09:14.550
You had a clear shot, or I
wouldn't have asked you to take it.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.510
- Do you understand?
- I think so.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.860
That's what happened.
Pull yourself together.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.310
- There's no forensic odontologist
report. - For the bite?

09:23.360 --> 09:26.440
Yeah. There should be.
And there's no DNA report.

09:27.320 --> 09:30.670
- Did they test for DNA back then?
- They would have taken a saliva swab,

09:30.720 --> 09:34.310
but it wouldn't have been DNA-rich
enough to get a marker in those days.

09:34.360 --> 09:37.070
- So...?
- So, when the science improved,

09:37.120 --> 09:39.070
it should have been reviewed.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.120
This file is a mess.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.110
- Let's start with another one.
- No, no. No.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.110
We're gonna stick with this one.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.950
Laura Fraser was young and she was pretty.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.190
And she was murdered in her
own home by an intruder.

09:53.240 --> 09:54.750
Now, that's a story.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.600
Excuse me. Well?

10:00.680 --> 10:03.790
How did it go? Did you get him?

10:03.840 --> 10:05.840
No, but we got the brother.

10:06.920 --> 10:09.070
Well, that's good.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.120
Excuse me?

10:12.680 --> 10:14.680
You been vetted to be in here?

10:16.440 --> 10:19.040
- I work in the building.
- Haven't seen you around.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.680
Er... We'll pick this up tomorrow.

10:26.520 --> 10:29.710
- For God's sake, Andy.
- Athif Kamara's got eyes everywhere.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.350
- You can't be too careful.
- She's a forensic scientist!

10:32.400 --> 10:34.950
- Doesn't look like one.
- All right!

10:35.000 --> 10:36.680
That's enough.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.240
Take these to the store.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.280
- What's up with him?
- He nearly blew the whole op.

11:16.160 --> 11:19.350
- Get back or I'll
shoot right now! - No!

11:23.240 --> 11:26.390
- Sorry, guv. I didn't realise
you were in here. - It's OK.

11:26.440 --> 11:28.760
Sorry. Sorry. I'm OK.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.600
- Sit down. Ma'am, sit down.
- Stupid.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.470
Just breathe. Just take deep breaths.

11:39.520 --> 11:42.230
How stupid am I? I'm OK.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.280
Let me clean you up.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.400
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.190
Right.

11:53.740 --> 11:55.240
(Sorry.)

11:57.320 --> 12:00.630
You're actually in the presence
of the CID First Aid Rep.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.670
Although I have to warn you,
you are my first patient.

12:08.320 --> 12:11.560
- Sounds like today was exciting.
- Yeah, thrill a minute.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.230
Sorry, you are...?

12:14.280 --> 12:16.710
Er... Stevens. I'm Katherine Stevens.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.760
Yeah, of course. Sorry.

12:19.880 --> 12:22.430
I came in at the same level as Andy Bevan.

12:22.980 --> 12:23.680
Right.

12:25.280 --> 12:28.120
And you're wondering why he's
on this op and you're not?

12:30.760 --> 12:32.360
Yes, guv, I am.

12:35.360 --> 12:38.040
If Bevan messes up, he
can fade into a crowd.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.710
But you...

12:41.760 --> 12:43.310
You stick out.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.480
Female CID with a pretty face.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.520
Perfect target practice.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.800
You have to be better
than them every time.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.590
When you know you are,

12:58.640 --> 13:00.950
that's when you stick your
head above the parapet.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I'll see you waving, I promise.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.640
Thank you.

13:09.040 --> 13:13.520
Anyway, you can't be at that much of a loose end
if you're still here at ten o'clock at night.

13:17.160 --> 13:21.240
Well, Superintendent Walker
has put me on cold cases.

13:23.480 --> 13:25.080
Cold cases?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.790
Oh, I didn't know about that.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.640
It's about clear-up rates.
You know Walker and his stats.

13:31.180 --> 13:32.680
Yes. Yeah, I do.

13:33.920 --> 13:37.390
Erm... Listen, my son Joe is
waiting for me out in Reception.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.990
I just need five minutes. Talk
to him? I'll be out in a minute.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.640
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.710
Romeo-Golf-One-Five-Six.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.550
Copy, Romeo-One-Five-Six.
Go ahead, Bancroft.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.670
I need assistance and an ambulance.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.720
Roger that. They're on their way.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.710
- Joe?
- Yeah?

14:30.760 --> 14:33.350
- Your mum, she's on her way down.
- Is she...?

14:33.400 --> 14:35.800
Don't worry. She's just got
a few cuts and bruises.

14:36.660 --> 14:37.500
(Yeah.)

14:55.880 --> 14:58.120
... report tonight. I better get started.

15:05.320 --> 15:08.120
Well done, guv. That could
have been the biggest balls-up.

15:09.920 --> 15:13.440
Why did Athif send his baby brother?

15:15.520 --> 15:19.560
Maybe it was always gonna be him
and your informant's playing us.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.590
I don't think so.

15:23.640 --> 15:25.200
My informant's sound.

15:26.200 --> 15:29.590
I mean, the times I've been
sat at home, stressing,

15:29.640 --> 15:32.440
and then she gets in at, like,
two in the morning and...

15:34.800 --> 15:35.890
You know, I know...

15:36.440 --> 15:39.760
I know that she's good at her job,
but sometimes I wish she didn't do it.

15:40.600 --> 15:44.000
- You never considered it?
- Do I look like a police officer?

15:45.480 --> 15:48.630
No, you don't. Thank God.

15:48.680 --> 15:49.910
That was heartfelt.

15:49.960 --> 15:53.440
Oh, no, it's just nice to talk
to someone who doesn't work here.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.990
- We're so in each other's pockets.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.110
My dad, he was a police officer,

15:59.160 --> 16:01.150
and when him and Mum split,

16:01.200 --> 16:03.470
he had to move to a different force.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.590
You know, the gossip.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.840
Right. I'm sure that can happen.

16:11.640 --> 16:16.950
So, if erm... If men in uniform
aren't your type, what is?

16:17.000 --> 16:17.980
Good question.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.830
I'll have to get back to you on that one.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.480
Joe.

16:25.080 --> 16:25.800
Come here.

16:28.560 --> 16:30.960
- Let's go home. Good night, Stevens.
- Night, Ma'am.

16:45.240 --> 16:48.030
I still don't understand why you
had to get in the middle of it.

16:48.080 --> 16:52.180
I thought the point of being a senior was so
that you didn't end up in the line of fire.

17:08.920 --> 17:10.520
Mum?

17:11.640 --> 17:13.430
Mum? You need to sleep.

17:13.480 --> 17:16.079
- I'm all right.
- Come on, let's get you to bed.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.870
It wasn't my fault.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.430
There should have been
two of us inside that pub.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.470
But the guv won't listen.

17:44.520 --> 17:46.400
She's frozen me out. She does that.

17:48.520 --> 17:51.840
I'm sorry it didn't work out for
you, but it's late and I'm tired.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.230
Ginny doesn't understand.

17:58.280 --> 18:02.440
She listens for two minutes, and then
something with the kids and she's gone.

18:08.440 --> 18:10.440
You get it.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.160
No. No.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.550
This isn't me.

18:22.600 --> 18:23.790
OK?

18:23.840 --> 18:26.640
You're a colleague and... you're married.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.990
- It's shit, the whole thing.
- Go with how you feel.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.440
No.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.800
Katherine!

18:37.840 --> 18:39.440
Let me in.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.880
Katherine!

19:32.880 --> 19:35.630
Police shot and injured
an armed man last night

19:35.680 --> 19:38.670
as they intervened in a potentially
deadly hostage situation.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.910
The injured man is currently being
treated at a local hospital,

19:41.960 --> 19:44.760
but his injuries are not
thought to be life-threatening.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.430
The kitchen window was smashed.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.920
The handbag was rifled through
and jewellery was stolen.

19:52.880 --> 19:56.310
- Murder weapon?
- Knife, not found at the scene.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.510
She was stabbed 18 times.

19:58.560 --> 20:01.240
She had punctured lungs, kidney, stomach.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.640
Her baby didn't stand a chance.

20:04.640 --> 20:05.920
She was pregnant?

20:07.160 --> 20:09.160
Four months.

20:10.400 --> 20:13.840
- We need to find out who did this to them.
- Turn it up, will you?

20:15.200 --> 20:18.830
This operation er... we have
known about for a period of time.

20:18.880 --> 20:23.230
To ensure the safety of our
officers and our community,

20:23.280 --> 20:26.190
we have apprehended several
of the gang members.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.160
They are now in custody.

20:29.560 --> 20:32.030
Ahem. Sorry about last night.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.430
- I was just...
- Oh, it's all right.

20:34.480 --> 20:38.960
You were after Athif Kamara and didn't
get him. No wonder you were pissed off.

20:43.320 --> 20:46.800
- I didn't catch your name.
- I'm Dr Anya Karim.

20:47.800 --> 20:51.030
- What are you two up to?
- Just tidying up cases for the Super.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.110
Nothing important.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.160
- Well, enjoy yourselves.
- Thanks.

20:56.600 --> 20:59.550
You said this case was going
to make us household names.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.280
I did. There's no point telling him that.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.390
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.740
And thank you for supporting
me out there, sir.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.590
You were very good.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.340
I should put you out in front
of the cameras more often.

21:17.800 --> 21:21.920
Especially if you're going
to apply to be my successor.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.310
You're retiring?

21:26.360 --> 21:28.800
30 years of service. I'm done.

21:31.400 --> 21:33.350
Well, you'll be missed, sir.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.070
It's a different force
to the one I joined.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.350
All these regulations.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.400
Chaps like Kamara thinking
they can run rings round us.

21:42.920 --> 21:45.240
Needs someone like you
to cut through the crap.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.400
Elizabeth, you're quite something.

21:49.880 --> 21:52.270
That girl could have died.

21:52.320 --> 21:53.830
Or you could have.

21:53.880 --> 21:57.200
There was an element of risk,
but I had it under control.

21:59.800 --> 22:02.270
Wind this up before I leave.

22:02.320 --> 22:06.350
Get me Athif Kamara, and don't hang about.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.800
Yes, sir.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.670
Ma'am.

22:29.720 --> 22:33.750
Nice-looking kid. Was that him and your wife?
You're not seeing them for a while, are you?

22:33.800 --> 22:35.150
I've got nothing to say to you.

22:35.200 --> 22:38.110
Carrying a firearm, possession
with intent to supply.

22:38.160 --> 22:41.310
You're looking at, what... 12 years?

22:41.360 --> 22:43.070
I'll do five, then I'm out.

22:43.120 --> 22:46.020
You don't have to do any. I can
get you a suspended sentence.

22:46.500 --> 22:49.630
The most you can do is put
a word in with the judge.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.230
Hm.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.880
Judges listen to me.

22:55.080 --> 22:57.030
Oh, come on.

22:57.080 --> 22:59.670
Got to be asking yourself,
"Did Athif know?"

22:59.720 --> 23:02.120
He puts you on this job and
we're sat there, waiting?

23:03.720 --> 23:05.720
What, have you pissed him off, is that it?

23:06.960 --> 23:11.350
I don't know. Maybe he just doesn't like you.
I mean, you're the smart one, with the brains?

23:11.400 --> 23:14.270
- You don't know what you're on about.
- OK, you tell me this.

23:14.320 --> 23:19.080
Was it you who decided to carry a
firearm, or did Athif tell you to?

23:24.360 --> 23:25.560
Well...

23:26.480 --> 23:28.790
.. I admire your loyalty, Daanish.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.870
I really do. But it's misplaced.

23:31.920 --> 23:35.070
This girl..... lives
next door to your brother.

23:35.120 --> 23:38.510
She was raped two weeks ago.
Athif and two of his mates.

23:38.560 --> 23:41.680
She's too scared to bring
charges. This lad...

23:43.120 --> 23:47.720
.. Athif assaulted him to get the week's takings
from his dad's shop. He won't talk, either.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.240
Athif.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.030
No good to anyone, really, is he?

23:56.080 --> 23:57.720
But you...

24:00.800 --> 24:03.120
.. you could run Highwater
under the radar.

24:04.440 --> 24:06.040
Without any of this...

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
.. psychotic shit.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.760
We wouldn't bother you and
you wouldn't bother us.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.400
It's your brother I want.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.000
Help me get him.

24:27.320 --> 24:29.430
Yeah.

24:29.480 --> 24:32.750
Just keep your head down. If you're
worried about anything, get out.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.640
Do you understand? Great.
Give us a call any time.

24:38.360 --> 24:40.070
That your informant?

24:40.120 --> 24:42.720
I'm not telling you who it is,
Andy, so wind your neck in.

24:43.800 --> 24:47.110
- Did Daanish talk to you?
- We need to keep the pressure up

24:47.160 --> 24:49.160
and drive Athif out of his hole.

25:13.480 --> 25:15.480
- That's Charlie.
- Thank you.

25:19.560 --> 25:22.430
Sir. I'm DS Stevens.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.750
I rang your wife and left
a message on your mobile.

25:24.800 --> 25:29.470
Oh, yes, the cold case.
Sounds interesting. Sit down.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.120
Thank you.

25:32.480 --> 25:35.840
- I don't want to keep you from your game.
- Oh, you're not keeping me.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.910
I'm sorry. I... I didn't realise erm...

25:39.960 --> 25:42.150
Spine's buggered. Arthritis.

25:42.200 --> 25:43.830
But I've had a good run.

25:43.880 --> 25:47.160
35 years on the force. Loved every minute.

25:48.560 --> 25:52.030
- Your case, was I on it?
- Yeah, you were, sir.

25:52.080 --> 25:54.360
Call me Charlie. When did it happen?

25:56.040 --> 25:57.560
1990.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.920
Laura Fraser.

26:01.680 --> 26:03.680
Do you remember her?

26:06.480 --> 26:08.480
Yes, I do.

26:15.120 --> 26:17.120
I'm sorry about the op.

26:18.360 --> 26:21.030
If you'd stopped that girl in
the pub, there'd be no shooting,

26:21.080 --> 26:24.180
Daanish would be in the nick and
I wouldn't be getting near him.

26:26.560 --> 26:29.800
- I thought it all through.
- Don't push it, Andy.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.710
Now, talk me through DS Stevens.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.630
She's on fast track, isn't she?

26:38.680 --> 26:41.990
- You're not thinking of putting
her on this op? - Well, I might be.

26:42.040 --> 26:44.040
Why? What are her
strengths? Is she any good?

26:45.520 --> 26:47.880
She's clever, goes the extra mile.

26:49.240 --> 26:52.150
- I can tell there's a "but".
- She's not experienced.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.760
The Super has her doing admin, cold cases.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.910
- Has she got Forensics back-up?
- Yeah.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.960
Dr Anya Karim.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.670
What case are they investigating?

27:06.720 --> 27:10.270
Late '80s, early '90s by
the looks of the photos.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.430
A young woman.

27:12.480 --> 27:14.670
Is it hard to forget unsolved ones?

27:14.720 --> 27:17.880
Not many of those on
my record, fortunately.

27:19.320 --> 27:21.670
Crackhead did for her.

27:21.720 --> 27:24.470
It was hard to catch those bastards.

27:24.520 --> 27:28.750
- They were often one-off offenders.
- I didn't realise it was a drug-related assault.

27:28.800 --> 27:32.870
Well, I couldn't prove anything, but
people lost their minds to the stuff.

27:32.920 --> 27:35.560
Violent burglary went through the roof.

27:36.520 --> 27:40.550
But that violent? She was stabbed
18 times and she was bitten.

27:41.760 --> 27:44.710
- Did you consider any other line of enquiry?
- Burglary stood up.

27:44.760 --> 27:50.360
Sometimes things just are as simple
as they seem. You'll learn that.

27:51.440 --> 27:54.680
- Did you have anyone in the frame for it?
- I would have arrested them.

27:58.560 --> 28:03.550
- You've been talking to Len Dorman?
- Laura's father? No, I haven't. Why?

28:03.600 --> 28:07.320
The man complained about us all the
bloody time. He was a pain in the arse.

28:08.120 --> 28:12.350
- His daughter had just been murdered.
- Does your governor know you're doing this?

28:12.400 --> 28:16.310
Yes. The whole initiative
is Superintendent Walker's.

28:16.360 --> 28:17.830
Not him.

28:19.080 --> 28:20.480
The man's a woodentop.

28:21.720 --> 28:25.550
This case is what it says it is.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.600
Leave it alone.

28:33.480 --> 28:34.880
Thank you.

28:37.120 --> 28:40.910
Make sure you bring your wallet this
time. I'm not paying for you to get home.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.360
(Tight git.)

28:48.360 --> 28:50.990
We're going down to the
pub. Want to come down?

28:51.040 --> 28:54.960
- No, thanks. I've got to get on with this.
- You're overworking yourself.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.040
You should have a bit of fun.

29:00.280 --> 29:04.280
- Why are you in such a good mood?
- I'm back in Bancroft's good books.

29:06.560 --> 29:08.550
Andy?

29:08.600 --> 29:11.500
If a murder victim was bitten,
what would that suggest to you?

29:12.680 --> 29:15.350
- Motive's sexual, isn't it?
- Yeah, you would think so.

29:15.400 --> 29:18.670
But my victim wasn't sexually assaulted.

29:18.720 --> 29:20.190
Er... I don't know, then.

29:20.240 --> 29:23.120
Anger is a motivation,
apparently. Listen to this.

29:24.240 --> 29:27.350
"The cannibalistic biter
bites to satisfy ego,

29:27.400 --> 29:30.150
consuming the antagonist's life essence."

29:31.700 --> 29:34.240
Bloody hell. Don't want
you getting any ideas.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.510
- What are you playing at?
- What?

29:39.560 --> 29:41.470
Katherine Stevens.

29:41.520 --> 29:44.070
- We're just having a bit of fun.
- She's on her own up here.

29:44.120 --> 29:45.670
No family, no friends.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.720
Don't screw her about.

29:52.080 --> 29:55.910
Hello, Mr Dorman. My name is
DS Katherine Stevens. Erm...

29:55.960 --> 30:00.640
I wanted to talk to you about your daughter
Laura's case, which we're reviewing.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.240
Stevens!

30:14.840 --> 30:17.520
You're not working late again,
are you? Have you eaten?

30:18.360 --> 30:20.960
- No, I haven't.
- Get in. You're coming to supper at mine.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.320
Come on.

30:38.040 --> 30:39.440
Come on in.

30:40.240 --> 30:43.950
- You're early.
- Ah. Joe, Katherine. Katherine, Joe.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.200
Oh, no. Of course, you've
already met, haven't you?

30:50.960 --> 30:53.480
What do you think you're playing at, Mum?

30:55.400 --> 30:58.030
She's a really nice girl.

30:58.080 --> 31:01.200
- OK. That's for me to decide.
- You need to get to know her better.

31:02.400 --> 31:06.030
- I'm not a child. I can do my own dating.
- Really? Cos I hadn't noticed.

31:07.080 --> 31:07.750
Well aired?

31:07.800 --> 31:10.830
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Are you sure?

31:15.080 --> 31:16.910
- When I was your age...
- Here we go.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.590
Hey, you, stop it.

31:18.640 --> 31:22.510
When I was your age, as a woman in the
force, you had to have a serious constitution.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.590
Not too much. I'm on the
early shift tomorrow.

31:24.640 --> 31:27.870
Come on! You're too nice,
that's your problem.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.590
They put him first and last on
the rota. He never complains.

31:30.640 --> 31:33.680
I don't mind working late. It
seems to bother you more than me.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.750
What do you do, Joe?

31:37.800 --> 31:39.880
I'm a physio, up at the hospital.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.790
But Mum thinks I should go private.

31:42.840 --> 31:44.750
Well, everybody else does.

31:44.800 --> 31:48.360
And then they get you to cover for them.
That's what I mean, you're too nice.

31:51.160 --> 31:52.550
- Can I help?
- Don't even ask.

31:52.600 --> 31:55.670
My mother likes to be in
control of the kitchen.

31:55.720 --> 31:58.510
So, what about you, Katherine?

31:58.560 --> 32:01.550
Are you skivvying for Superintendent
Walker because you want to,

32:01.600 --> 32:03.550
or because you feel you have to?

32:03.600 --> 32:05.590
What I'm doing isn't exactly skivvying.

32:07.640 --> 32:11.440
Well, you'll put in all the hard work, he'll
take all the glory. I can tell you that.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.630
Come across anything interesting?

32:13.680 --> 32:15.710
I've only just started on my first one.

32:15.760 --> 32:19.310
- Oh, yeah? What is it?
- Do we have to talk shop?

32:19.360 --> 32:21.710
It happened years ago, in 1990.

32:21.760 --> 32:24.360
The thing is, there's
something odd about it.

32:26.280 --> 32:29.440
- Odd? - Yeah, it just...
It doesn't feel right.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.320
Why not?

32:33.280 --> 32:37.800
Well, it was a burglary...
and it was vicious.

32:38.880 --> 32:41.190
Hm. Burglars can kill.

32:41.240 --> 32:43.740
If they get disturbed, or
if something goes wrong.

32:44.360 --> 32:46.040
She was bitten.

32:47.560 --> 32:51.960
That's what I don't get. There was
no sexual assault, but she was bitten.

32:53.160 --> 32:54.560
Why would anyone do that?

33:05.640 --> 33:08.760
Smother it! Joe, get those curtains.

33:24.440 --> 33:25.720
Elizabeth, please!

33:26.520 --> 33:27.220
Elizabeth!

34:01.480 --> 34:04.190
Guv? Guv?

34:09.920 --> 34:11.989
Hello?

34:12.040 --> 34:13.440
Hello?

34:23.560 --> 34:27.870
- OK, so what have we found?
- We've got a footprint under the window.

34:27.920 --> 34:30.120
The bastards have chucked
in a petrol bomb.

34:32.560 --> 34:34.560
Are you all right, guv?

34:36.280 --> 34:37.679
Guv?

34:40.800 --> 34:44.190
Heard about last night.
Must have been the Kamaras.

34:44.239 --> 34:47.239
Bastards think they can get
away with anything. I hate that.

34:47.800 --> 34:50.110
How are we doing with the
Laura Fraser forensics?

34:50.159 --> 34:53.590
Badly. Everything examined should
have been put in the storage facility.

34:53.639 --> 34:57.510
I've rung through and there's
nothing under "Fraser, 1990".

34:57.560 --> 35:02.310
- Who was the copper running this?
- DI Haverstock. I met him yesterday.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.990
He reckons it was a drug-related burglary.

35:05.040 --> 35:06.150
Makes sense.

35:06.200 --> 35:10.300
Yeah, but he was really defensive about it,
and then he tried to get me to drop the case.

35:11.200 --> 35:15.350
OK, it's not worth ruffling feathers.
Maybe we should move on, start another one.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.110
No.

35:17.160 --> 35:18.470
Laura Fraser died.

35:18.520 --> 35:22.880
I'm having a go at solving this
one, and if you don't want to
help me, I'll find someone who can.

35:27.800 --> 35:31.430
George, get Forensics out to this car and
send the jacket off to the lab, will you?

35:31.480 --> 35:33.480
Cool.

35:35.160 --> 35:37.070
Sir.

35:37.120 --> 35:40.870
- Bloody hell, Elizabeth.
- Morning, Cliff. Sorry to bring you down here.

35:40.920 --> 35:44.910
As I'm living in the middle of a crime
scene, I thought I might as well run it.

35:45.460 --> 35:47.710
Look just give me a minute.
Coffee's on the side.

35:47.760 --> 35:50.060
Andy, sort Superintendent
Walker out, will you?

35:52.480 --> 35:54.310
- Hello?
- Liz, it's me.

35:54.360 --> 35:59.080
There's some jumped-up detective
snooping around the Fraser case.

36:00.840 --> 36:02.310
Look, now is not a good time.

36:02.360 --> 36:04.720
Come and see me. You'd better.

36:10.120 --> 36:11.480
Everything all right?

36:12.280 --> 36:14.280
Come and have a look at this.

36:15.880 --> 36:16.830
Right.

36:17.880 --> 36:23.630
They followed me from the hospital to the
police station, and then back to here.

36:23.680 --> 36:27.390
We found the car. It's burnt
out, registered as stolen.

36:27.440 --> 36:30.710
- They're taking it to the
lab for examination. - Hm.

36:30.760 --> 36:33.190
Well, if there's anything I can do...

36:33.240 --> 36:36.760
I'd er... I'd like to bring
Katherine Stevens onto this team.

36:38.480 --> 36:42.590
- Stevens is working on something for me.
- Andy, can you go back down to the station?

36:42.640 --> 36:46.830
Go through all the CCTV again and see
if we can ID any faces in that car.

36:46.880 --> 36:48.880
- OK, guv.
- Thank you.

36:52.440 --> 36:55.350
Look, Cliff, do me a favour. I
really need a woman on this team.

36:55.400 --> 36:59.270
The lads are really stirred up. It would
help to have Katherine Stevens in the mix.

36:59.320 --> 37:03.390
I'm sorry. I would if I could,
but as I said, she's busy.

37:04.440 --> 37:06.310
Working on cold cases?

37:06.360 --> 37:08.630
Yes, as it happens.

37:08.680 --> 37:10.710
The chief is always on at
us to keep things tight.

37:10.760 --> 37:13.310
Cold cases is just money down
the drain. You know that.

37:13.360 --> 37:16.870
I talked to him about it yesterday.
He thought it was a good idea.

37:16.920 --> 37:18.960
You spoke to Alan yesterday?

37:20.800 --> 37:24.440
I presume he's asked you to apply
to be Detective Chief Super, too?

37:26.640 --> 37:28.740
He likes to keep his
options open, doesn't he?

37:32.160 --> 37:34.160
Good luck with the clear-up.

38:12.880 --> 38:15.310
Who are you?

38:15.360 --> 38:17.680
Er... I'm... I'm the police.

38:20.360 --> 38:22.950
I've tried to contact you,
Mr Dorman. You don't answer.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.590
- What do you want? - We're
re-investigating your daughter's case.

38:30.280 --> 38:34.080
I don't hear from you lot for
years... and now you appear.

38:35.320 --> 38:37.600
How long have you been in CID? A week?

38:38.320 --> 38:41.510
- Ten months.
- Well, then, we're off to the races.

38:41.560 --> 38:44.990
It must have been awful for you
that that case didn't get solved.

38:45.040 --> 38:46.940
I don't know how I would live with that.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.520
I am so sorry.

38:53.840 --> 38:56.960
27 years and nobody...

38:58.160 --> 39:01.360
.. not one of you has ever said sorry.

39:21.800 --> 39:27.230
It's just me here now. The wife died last
autumn. Rest of the place is closed off.

39:27.280 --> 39:30.040
I don't need the rooms. Just this one.

39:32.160 --> 39:34.160
Is this Laura?

39:34.960 --> 39:36.720
She's our only child.

39:38.720 --> 39:42.240
Maybe that made it worse. I don't know.

39:43.040 --> 39:44.120
Please.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.870
Thank you.

40:00.960 --> 40:04.080
It's like... she's holding me.

40:05.480 --> 40:07.480
She won't let me go.

40:09.120 --> 40:11.120
Not till we find out who killed her.

40:21.640 --> 40:23.640
- Can I?
- Yeah.

40:29.240 --> 40:32.070
I was never sure if it was a break-in.

40:32.120 --> 40:33.790
I brought Laura up to be smart.

40:33.840 --> 40:35.350
If she'd have walked in that house

40:35.400 --> 40:38.440
and seen that window broken,
she'd have got the hell out.

40:39.440 --> 40:41.040
And if it was a burglar...

40:42.040 --> 40:44.270
.. why would he kill her?

40:44.320 --> 40:47.680
Bite her? I mean, why would
anyone do that to her?

40:48.640 --> 40:50.840
Did you tell DI Haverstock
what you thought?

40:51.680 --> 40:53.110
He chose not to hear.

40:53.160 --> 40:54.310
What do you mean?

40:54.360 --> 40:57.830
He was all right at first. He
couldn't have been more helpful.

40:57.880 --> 41:01.630
Then he found out I was
a miner and he changed.

41:01.680 --> 41:03.160
I was the enemy.

41:05.280 --> 41:07.230
He didn't investigate the case properly?

41:07.280 --> 41:10.440
He stopped caring! They all did.

41:11.880 --> 41:14.390
Apart from one.

41:14.440 --> 41:15.960
A policewoman.

41:17.160 --> 41:19.590
- She tried.
- What was her name?

41:19.640 --> 41:24.680
She was on the news. Some drug thing
in town, a couple of days back.

41:26.520 --> 41:30.120
- Bancroft?
- Yes, Bancroft.

41:50.440 --> 41:51.910
Oi!

41:56.440 --> 41:58.790
I thought you were Julie.

41:58.840 --> 42:00.840
She's on at me about these.

42:07.680 --> 42:09.670
How are you doing, Charlie?

42:09.720 --> 42:11.830
I'm proud of my record, Elizabeth,

42:11.880 --> 42:14.630
but that case, the Fraser case,

42:14.680 --> 42:17.150
I shut it down too soon.

42:17.200 --> 42:19.950
You didn't say that to Stevens
when she came talking to you?

42:20.000 --> 42:22.590
- Of course not.
- Then what did you say?

42:22.640 --> 42:26.640
- I told her it was burglary went wrong.
- Which is what it was, so just leave it at that.

42:27.640 --> 42:29.390
Bloody Len Dorman,

42:29.440 --> 42:32.910
expecting us to work around the clock,
bitching us up at the same time.

42:32.960 --> 42:37.270
- Oh, well, he was trouble, wasn't he?
- His girl wasn't much better.

42:37.320 --> 42:40.560
You said she was a piece
of work, and you knew her.

42:42.160 --> 42:44.160
Well, you did everything you could.

42:47.320 --> 42:50.280
When you told me they were mining trash...

42:51.920 --> 42:54.310
.. clouded my judgment.

42:54.360 --> 42:56.160
Well, that's what they were.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.870
But you still did a thorough
investigation. We... We both did.

43:01.920 --> 43:05.270
18 stab wounds, bitten.

43:05.320 --> 43:08.270
Your DS is right. Why
would a burglar do that?

43:08.320 --> 43:10.840
Look, there's no point
in raking over this.

43:15.280 --> 43:16.400
Please, just...

43:17.400 --> 43:20.870
Just leave it and I'll get it closed down.

43:20.920 --> 43:22.520
Trust me.

43:25.120 --> 43:27.120
My back isn't arthritic.

43:27.920 --> 43:29.920
It's spine cancer.

43:33.520 --> 43:35.320
Oh, Charlie.

43:36.320 --> 43:38.550
I'm so sorry.

43:38.600 --> 43:43.470
When you know your days are numbered, you
start to think about the things you did wrong.

43:43.520 --> 43:46.320
I didn't give Laura Fraser a fair shot.

43:47.800 --> 43:50.230
I'm gonna help DS Stevens.

43:50.280 --> 43:53.510
Put the work in now I never did back then.

43:53.560 --> 43:56.350
Miner's daughter or not,
someone killed that girl.

43:56.400 --> 43:58.400
I'm gonna find out who.

44:06.600 --> 44:07.800
OK.
