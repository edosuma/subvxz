WEBVTT

00:51.660 --> 00:54.445
This is
my half-brother'’s story.

00:55.838 --> 00:58.014
I tell it because
it'’s all I can do

00:58.188 --> 00:59.711
with the way
things turned out.

01:02.497 --> 01:07.023
Eugene left me with something more important than any of the facts.

01:08.807 --> 01:11.984
Now, first thing people
get wrong about his story

01:12.159 --> 01:14.204
is the beginning.

01:14.378 --> 01:16.946
It didn'’t start
with the Wells lady.

01:17.120 --> 01:20.950
It started with
the first train
full of homesteaders.

01:23.039 --> 01:27.522
Amongst the heartbroken fearful who arrived in Bismark on that day

01:27.696 --> 01:32.962
were John, Olivia
and Eugene Baker.

01:35.007 --> 01:36.748
The Bakers had moved
their lives West

01:36.922 --> 01:39.490
into the Great Plains,
on a promise.

01:39.664 --> 01:44.974
A promise that now looked
as rotten as the dirt
they stood on.

01:45.148 --> 01:49.892
They prayed for rain
and began to build
a new life up from scratch.

01:50.806 --> 01:54.026
But John wasn'’t convinced.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.944
He believed there was something cursed about this land.

02:01.382 --> 02:04.472
Over the next years,
John'’s drinking worsened...

02:04.646 --> 02:06.648
...and he became paranoid.

02:06.822 --> 02:09.564
His mind filled with visions of some other life...

02:10.869 --> 02:13.133
where he could live
in God'’s grace again.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.833
And just like that, when Eugene was five years old,

02:18.007 --> 02:20.444
he lost his father.You'’re just leaving?

02:22.533 --> 02:26.972
An absence was created
that would haunt him
for the rest of his life.

02:29.845 --> 02:33.457
Eugene only ever got one postcard from his father.

02:33.631 --> 02:37.244
In it, John claimed he had found the eye of God

02:37.418 --> 02:39.376
in the most beautiful place on Earth,

02:40.377 --> 02:42.858
the Gulf Coast of Mexico.

02:44.773 --> 02:48.211
Olivia quickly tried to fill that absence in Eugene'’s life,

02:48.385 --> 02:51.171
and a year later
she married George Evans,

02:51.345 --> 02:55.175
a county deputy, farmer
and my father.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.308
But John Baker and the world he wrote about

02:58.482 --> 03:00.571
were never far
from my brother'’s mind.

03:02.921 --> 03:06.011
He wondered what his father had really found out there.

03:09.580 --> 03:12.757
Then, when Eugene was 17,

03:12.931 --> 03:15.195
something else
took his attention.

03:18.154 --> 03:20.678
All of ours, for that matter.

03:24.160 --> 03:29.078
Just like the curse
John had spoken of,
the land turned on us.

03:29.252 --> 03:33.604
My fellow Americans, I have been on a journey to nine states.

03:33.778 --> 03:36.172
Fourteen storms hit Bismark in the first year.

03:36.346 --> 03:39.393
I saw a group
of families who had lost
their wheat crops,

03:39.567 --> 03:41.264
lost their corn crops,

03:41.438 --> 03:43.484
basically withered
without food.

03:43.658 --> 03:45.834
The more we tried
to start over,

03:46.008 --> 03:47.575
the worse they got.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.533
And the banks came
for Bismark.

03:53.102 --> 03:57.324
Crazy preachers would scream about God and salvation,

03:57.498 --> 04:00.109
while families did the only thing they still could...

04:02.764 --> 04:04.635
...until they couldn'’t even do that anymore.

04:06.855 --> 04:10.032
Eugene hid away in the abandoned family barn.

04:11.163 --> 04:13.601
He would daydream
about his destiny,

04:13.775 --> 04:16.212
fantasizing about a life
like his heroes...

04:16.386 --> 04:18.083
-

04:18.258 --> 04:20.825
...the outlaws
and adventurers
he read about.

04:26.353 --> 04:30.095
I suppose no one warned Eugene about what can happen

04:30.270 --> 04:32.228
when you dream about
something so much.

04:40.628 --> 04:43.631
That'’s how Allison Wells
entered this story...

04:47.591 --> 04:49.376
...like a bat out of hell...

04:50.333 --> 04:51.813
headed straight...

04:53.945 --> 04:55.382
for my brother.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.400
Roadblock for me,
would you?

05:35.813 --> 05:38.120
Look at this cold bastard.

05:38.294 --> 05:41.079
I bet he'’d be in bed
with a different broad
every night if he were real.

05:41.253 --> 05:45.606
I bet he knows exactly
the right thing to say
to a girl to make her crazy.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.304
That'’s all it takes really...
words.

05:48.478 --> 05:50.437
Unless you live
in a dead old town
like this.

05:53.831 --> 05:55.180
Hey, what'’s going on?

05:55.355 --> 05:57.226
Harold,
he'’ll tell you all about it.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.967
Check it out?Mm-hmm.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.926
All right, folks, we got
some things need to be said.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.625
So, y'’all quiet down now
so that they can be heard.

06:04.799 --> 06:05.930
Ma'’am?

06:06.104 --> 06:08.411
During their raid
on a Missouri bank,

06:08.585 --> 06:12.154
the thief and murderer,
Allison Wells,

06:12.328 --> 06:14.591
sent a nine-year-old
little girl to heaven.

06:14.765 --> 06:17.377
-Nine years old.

06:17.551 --> 06:20.336
And that was just
one of five human souls

06:20.510 --> 06:22.469
that were taken on that day.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.473
If you see this woman,

06:26.647 --> 06:27.735
do not confront her.

06:28.866 --> 06:32.217
She will not hesitate
to take another life.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.524
Now, all and all,
she'’s just one little lady

06:34.698 --> 06:38.049
with half
the Texas law enforcement
trying to find her.

06:38.223 --> 06:39.877
And find her we shall.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.532
Is this real, this reward?

06:42.706 --> 06:45.056
Ten thousand dollars
if we find her?

06:47.102 --> 06:49.191
You'’re Deputy Evans'’ boy,
ain'’t you?

06:50.279 --> 06:52.324
Yes, sir.
He'’s my stepfather.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.892
Well, I appreciate
your interest, son,

06:55.066 --> 06:56.894
but we'’ve already got
all the help we need

06:57.068 --> 06:59.810
from the Evans family,
so just run on home.

07:01.899 --> 07:04.772
Search party meeting
at church after the service.

07:04.946 --> 07:07.427
God and coincidence

07:07.601 --> 07:10.168
cannot occupy the same Earth.

07:10.342 --> 07:12.083
We know this,
ladies and gentlemen,

07:12.257 --> 07:16.087
for where there is a sign,
there is the hand of God.

07:16.261 --> 07:19.830
And our community
is under his palm now.

07:20.004 --> 07:21.353
And now we see why...

07:22.093 --> 07:23.617
women like Allison Wells--

07:26.968 --> 07:28.448
Eugene.

07:32.756 --> 07:35.019
What a drag.

07:36.499 --> 07:37.457
Ready to go?

07:39.241 --> 07:40.372
Eugene?

07:41.417 --> 07:42.592
Hey, Joe.

07:45.073 --> 07:46.770
I want you at home today.Why?

07:46.944 --> 07:48.555
With that Wells lady
on the loose,

07:48.729 --> 07:50.774
it'’s not safe
around these parts.

07:50.948 --> 07:53.298
We'’re going with
the search party, Ma.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.865
We'’ll be safe.

07:56.171 --> 07:58.260
We'’ll look after
each other, all right?

07:58.434 --> 07:59.609
You have my word.

08:00.175 --> 08:01.785
Mmm, home by dark.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.787
Yes, ma'’am.And stick together.

08:03.961 --> 08:05.049
Give me that.

08:06.007 --> 08:07.399
Can I come?No, you cannot.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.140
By dark.Yeah.

08:10.881 --> 08:13.493
Can you even imagine
having that much money?

08:13.667 --> 08:16.017
I sure as hell can.
Can'’t you?

08:16.191 --> 08:17.714
No, not really.

08:18.672 --> 08:20.500
I bet you actually
can'’t neither.

08:21.370 --> 08:23.154
Fighting words, Evans.

08:23.328 --> 08:25.766
Hell, you best give me
your share so as
I don'’t whup ya.

08:25.940 --> 08:28.856
I will die of laughing
before you whip me, boy.

08:35.253 --> 08:37.038
Think we'’ll
find her dead?

08:37.212 --> 08:39.388
I don'’t know. Probably.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.656
You okay?

08:48.266 --> 08:51.052
Hey? What'’s the matter?Nothing.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.533
Come on, tell me.
What'’s up?

08:56.971 --> 08:58.494
We'’re going to California.

09:01.323 --> 09:03.020
They told us this morning.

09:03.194 --> 09:04.979
Said we are giving up
on Texas.

09:06.850 --> 09:07.982
Shit, man.

09:08.765 --> 09:10.027
How long you going for?

09:10.941 --> 09:12.552
Well, forever.

09:13.944 --> 09:16.251
I mean, when you
think about it,
why would we come back?

09:23.040 --> 09:24.128
Yeah.

09:27.654 --> 09:31.135
Guess you'’ll have to find
someone else to bitch to.

09:31.309 --> 09:34.878
Ain'’t no one I'’d rather
bitch to than you, Garza.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.839
Can you handle that?Let go, you jackass!

09:39.013 --> 09:40.797
No. I gotta
get it in before you go.

09:40.971 --> 09:42.277
Yeah.

09:42.451 --> 09:44.758
Come get me!
Come get me!

09:44.932 --> 09:47.064
I'’m gonna miss you, buddy.

09:47.238 --> 09:49.110
Come on! Come on!

09:49.284 --> 09:50.459
Let'’s go!

09:57.031 --> 09:58.598
What you gonna do?

10:01.644 --> 10:03.341
I'’m faster than you, boy.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.039
I always have been.

10:15.527 --> 10:18.443
You really think we'’re going
to find her in all this?

10:19.662 --> 10:20.881
It'’s worth a try.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.815
I said "before dark."

10:43.164 --> 10:44.818
George wants to talk to you.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.559
You'’re in trouble.

10:49.561 --> 10:50.867
His request.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.489
You wanted to see me?

11:11.453 --> 11:14.543
A mother'’s word... is law.

11:16.980 --> 11:20.288
When a mother tells a son
to do something, he does it.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.507
Always.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.292
That'’s how families work.

11:25.075 --> 11:26.555
Good times and bad.

11:30.951 --> 11:32.735
We understand each other?

11:34.041 --> 11:36.565
Yeah-- Uh, yes, sir.

11:40.482 --> 11:41.744
What you got there?

11:43.050 --> 11:44.138
Nothing.

11:44.312 --> 11:45.574
Do us both a favor.

11:45.748 --> 11:48.185
Don'’t act like
you think I'’m stupid.

11:56.498 --> 12:01.851
What money from what job
did you pay for that garbage?

12:04.419 --> 12:07.639
See, your mother may
let you off easy, but I can'’t.

12:08.989 --> 12:11.469
There'’s no room for boys
in this family anymore.

12:12.209 --> 12:13.733
Think about that.

12:16.953 --> 12:17.954
Wash up.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.755
Lights out.

13:36.946 --> 13:39.427
Don'’t make a sound.

13:41.298 --> 13:42.125
Don'’t!

14:02.363 --> 14:03.712
It'’s yours if you want it.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.116
What'’s your name?

14:21.121 --> 14:23.384
-I'’m Allison.
-I know who you are.

14:23.558 --> 14:27.605
Well, then it'’s only fair
that I know who you are.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.261
Uh... Eugene.

14:31.783 --> 14:33.046
Eugene.

14:35.526 --> 14:37.311
That'’s a smart name.

14:41.228 --> 14:43.883
Ain'’t that you? Huh?

14:45.928 --> 14:48.452
-They said you was a killer.
-I'’m not a killer.

14:54.719 --> 14:55.895
Eugene...

14:57.244 --> 14:59.550
I'’m gonna be
real frank with you.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.639
I'’m trying
to maintain composure,

15:01.813 --> 15:04.773
but this hole in my leg
is hurting like
a motherfucker right now.

15:06.296 --> 15:09.909
So, if you help me,
I'’ll tell you everything.
Listen to me.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.606
Eugene, listen to me.

15:14.087 --> 15:15.436
I'’m not a killer.

15:19.396 --> 15:21.833
You still wouldn'’t
believe my story.

15:28.188 --> 15:29.754
Just like one of these books.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.804
Except I'’m the man
in the hat.

15:43.377 --> 15:46.249
Wow. Not bad.

15:53.387 --> 15:55.041
Oh, Jesus.

15:55.215 --> 15:56.868
Looks worse than it is.

15:57.782 --> 15:59.915
All right.
Got steady hands, kid?

16:00.089 --> 16:01.786
I think you should
see a doctor or something.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.311
No, no, no.
You'’re my doctor now, okay?

16:04.485 --> 16:05.355
Dr. Eugene.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.011
Okay?Okay.

16:09.925 --> 16:11.666
Okay. Clean your hands
with that.

16:16.366 --> 16:17.802
Okay.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.979
Everything'’s gonna
be fine, all right?

16:20.153 --> 16:23.678
Okay. Get the tweezers.
Clean them.

16:26.246 --> 16:27.682
Okay.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.903
You sure you didn'’t
kill nobody?

16:36.212 --> 16:37.213
No.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.434
Okay.All right.

16:41.696 --> 16:43.393
Uh...

16:43.567 --> 16:46.701
Get the, uh...
Rinse the alcohol on--
right smack on it.

16:46.875 --> 16:49.399
Just pour it all on.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.363
Holy shit!

16:57.016 --> 16:58.582
Holy shit!

17:01.933 --> 17:02.978
Okay.

17:03.152 --> 17:04.414
Give me the flashlight.

17:05.241 --> 17:06.460
Okay.

17:07.243 --> 17:08.505
Can you see the bullet?

17:10.159 --> 17:12.161
Yeah, yeah. I think so.

17:12.335 --> 17:13.510
Okay, take it out.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.209
It'’s okay.

17:17.993 --> 17:19.386
Okay.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.779
Uh, think of something nice.

17:25.609 --> 17:27.307
Okay. Okay.

17:40.450 --> 17:41.538
Okay.

17:54.464 --> 17:56.423
Okay. Bandage it up.

18:03.908 --> 18:05.519
Okay, I'’ll hold it on.
Yeah.Hold it.

18:10.306 --> 18:11.568
Okay.

18:17.792 --> 18:18.836
You okay?

18:19.663 --> 18:20.882
Yeah.

18:21.622 --> 18:23.189
It feels good.

18:23.363 --> 18:24.625
That was amazing.

18:25.234 --> 18:27.236
Uh, you thirsty?

18:27.410 --> 18:29.456
And he'’s a mind reader too.

18:31.458 --> 18:32.676
I'’ll be right back.

18:36.811 --> 18:38.378
As fate would have it,

18:38.552 --> 18:40.728
Allison had lost her
own family and farm

18:40.902 --> 18:43.731
in Missouri one year previous.

18:43.905 --> 18:47.517
Her mother and father had both succumbed to pneumonia.

18:47.691 --> 18:51.478
Now, I have no intention
of painting Allison Wells
as a liar,

18:51.652 --> 18:52.827
as others have,

18:53.784 --> 18:55.308
but I will say

18:55.482 --> 18:58.006
she understood
who her audience was

18:58.180 --> 19:00.574
and told her story accordingly.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.099
How old are you?

19:06.406 --> 19:07.842
Uh, 25.

19:10.671 --> 19:11.802
Uh-huh.

19:15.197 --> 19:18.635
You got a girlfriend, Mr. 25?

19:23.901 --> 19:27.122
Well... park yourself.

19:27.296 --> 19:29.820
I guess
I should explain things.

19:36.392 --> 19:39.352
I appreciate
your caution, kid, but...

19:39.526 --> 19:41.919
right now, if you wanted,
you could break me in two.

20:00.416 --> 20:02.549
It'’s true I robbed that bank.

20:02.723 --> 20:03.985
And it wasn'’t the first.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.642
I never killed anybody.

20:13.647 --> 20:16.432
Well, if you didn'’t,
then who did?

20:16.606 --> 20:20.044
According to the story Allison told Eugene that night,

20:20.219 --> 20:23.222
she was the victim
of this whole affair.

20:23.396 --> 20:28.488
After her land was taken
and her family passed,
she became an outlaw.

20:28.662 --> 20:31.578
It was her only way
of taking something back.

20:31.752 --> 20:33.493
Which brought her

20:33.667 --> 20:36.931
to the Guthrie Plains
bank robbery.

20:37.105 --> 20:39.194
It had been her fourth robbery that month,

20:39.368 --> 20:41.979
but it was the first
with any loss of life.

20:42.153 --> 20:45.766
The fact, she insisted, was solely the police'’s fault.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.594
Those cops, they got scared.

20:47.768 --> 20:50.074
The second we came out of that
bank, they started firing.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.686
Didn'’t matter that there was
still people on the street
and in the sidewalk.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.823
Her claim was a stray bullet from the police

20:59.997 --> 21:02.522
ended the life of that innocent little girl.

21:13.228 --> 21:15.709
It was straight out of
one of Eugene'’s stories.

21:16.884 --> 21:19.365
Her...

21:19.539 --> 21:22.281
stealing back the memory
from a world that had
taken everything...

21:23.543 --> 21:25.196
...and left her with nothing...

21:25.371 --> 21:27.242
-...and no one.

21:27.416 --> 21:30.289
That'’s why I need you,
'’cause I don'’t have
anyone else.

21:34.205 --> 21:36.643
You can stay here
as long as you need a room.

21:37.644 --> 21:39.820
As long as you want.Thank you.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.130
I'’m sorry.

21:47.175 --> 21:48.481
It'’s okay.

21:51.092 --> 21:54.225
Afraid I'’m gonna
have to ask you for more
than I know is fair.

21:57.577 --> 22:00.319
How much would it be worth to
you to help me get to Mexico?

22:02.364 --> 22:03.452
Mexico?

22:04.235 --> 22:06.586
How does $20,000 sound?

22:08.152 --> 22:09.284
That'’s double your bounty.

22:09.458 --> 22:10.938
That'’s the point.

22:11.112 --> 22:12.853
You got that much on you?

22:13.027 --> 22:14.768
I don'’t have a nickel.

22:14.942 --> 22:17.292
But I know
my way around a bank,
even a Mexican one.

22:17.466 --> 22:20.426
And I can have you that money
before you even know I'’m gone.

22:23.037 --> 22:25.344
All you need to do
is get me a car.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.783
Well, that ain'’t an easy thing
to get around here.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.611
Especially
with an empty wallet.

22:31.785 --> 22:34.440
Maybe I'’m wrong, but you seem
like a pretty capable fella.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.268
I need a few days
to rest up.

22:38.748 --> 22:41.055
And if you apply yourself
to our problem between
now and then,

22:41.229 --> 22:43.492
well, then, I'’d say we'’re
in business, wouldn'’t you?

22:49.977 --> 22:52.022
I'’ve seen your fields, Eugene.

22:52.196 --> 22:55.983
I know your family'’s in trouble,
same as mine was.

22:56.157 --> 22:58.377
I mean,
if there'’s a simpler way
to fix things for you,

22:58.551 --> 23:00.466
I don'’t have the faintest
what that would be.

23:03.860 --> 23:04.992
I could turn you in.

23:17.657 --> 23:19.398
Sure. You could.

23:23.706 --> 23:27.449
But, Eugene, and I say this
with all seriousness
and sincerity.

23:29.059 --> 23:32.062
If that'’s the choice you make,
and it is your choice to make,

23:32.236 --> 23:35.588
have no illusions
of the consequences.

23:35.762 --> 23:38.025
I won'’t be another victim
of their lies.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.332
I'’d rather die by my own hand.

23:42.638 --> 23:44.161
Or yours.

23:58.001 --> 24:00.395
This is
a land of burden, kid.

24:01.831 --> 24:04.268
Right now,
you get to pick yours.

24:06.706 --> 24:08.751
Makes you
one of the lucky ones.

24:42.350 --> 24:44.483
Why are you naked?Shh!

24:45.309 --> 24:47.268
Okay, but...
what the hell?

24:47.442 --> 24:49.836
Don'’t worry about it, okay?
And don'’t swear.

24:50.010 --> 24:51.315
I ain'’t worried.
I'’m curious.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.795
Don'’t be.

24:52.969 --> 24:55.276
All right, just go back
to sleep. Come on.

25:20.257 --> 25:22.172
You'’re heading
into town today.

25:22.346 --> 25:23.957
Look for some work.

25:24.131 --> 25:25.306
Take your sister with you.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.308
Yes, sir, okay.

25:28.091 --> 25:30.006
And gear up.

25:30.180 --> 25:32.313
They'’re saying
it'’s a windy one.

26:03.474 --> 26:04.606
Hey.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.784
Hi.I thought you might
want to change.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.011
It'’s perfect.

26:20.274 --> 26:23.625
I hope it fits okay.
It'’s my mother'’s.

26:23.799 --> 26:26.802
She don'’t wear it much, so
she shouldn'’t notice it'’s gone.

26:27.847 --> 26:29.152
She'’ll notice.

26:29.326 --> 26:31.720
Maybe she'’ll come in here
looking for it.

26:31.894 --> 26:34.462
What, in here? No, no.

26:34.636 --> 26:37.508
They ain'’t got
much use for this
since the drought started.

26:42.296 --> 26:44.733
Okay. Thank you.

26:53.133 --> 26:54.613
Oh, excuse me.

27:16.722 --> 27:19.202
What are you looking at?Uh, nothing.

27:19.376 --> 27:20.682
You'’re supposed to
take me to town.

27:20.856 --> 27:22.597
Yeah, well, I'’m busy.You ain'’t.

27:22.771 --> 27:25.165
-I am.
-What were you looking at?

27:25.339 --> 27:27.558
Nothing. I was just
seeing how it looked
in there, that'’s all.

27:27.733 --> 27:28.777
I ain'’t dumb.
What'’s in there?

27:28.951 --> 27:31.214
Ain'’t nothing
in there. Christ!

27:34.565 --> 27:36.567
Okay, I'’ll tell you
if you promise me

27:36.742 --> 27:38.918
you ain'’t gonna go in there
and look for yourself.

27:39.092 --> 27:42.095
I don'’t want Mama
or George going in there
until I clean it up.

27:42.269 --> 27:43.400
Clean up what?

27:43.574 --> 27:44.488
You promise?

27:44.663 --> 27:46.229
Yeah, tell me.

27:51.365 --> 27:56.109
Two dead dogs. Lying there
with their blood and their guts
all in the dirt.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.067
Flies all around.

27:58.894 --> 28:00.461
Dogs? Whose dogs?

28:01.331 --> 28:02.724
Nobody'’s.

28:02.898 --> 28:04.160
The blue yonder'’s.

28:05.205 --> 28:06.510
What killed '’em?

28:07.555 --> 28:09.209
Coyotes or something.
How should I know?

28:09.383 --> 28:11.254
That'’s sad.

28:11.907 --> 28:13.517
That'’s life.

28:14.736 --> 28:15.998
Wait, where you going now?

28:16.172 --> 28:17.783
Going to meet Joe Garza.

28:17.957 --> 28:20.960
What about?
Can I come? Nothing and no.

28:21.134 --> 28:24.485
Hey, Eugene

28:28.010 --> 28:30.491
Why the hell you drag me
out here, Evans?

28:36.540 --> 28:38.804
I got some private words
for you, Garza.

28:40.936 --> 28:43.983
You know,
I thought we was gonna
look for that woman today.

28:44.157 --> 28:46.768
So I got up
butt-crack of dawn.

28:46.942 --> 28:48.509
And then
you don'’t even show.

28:49.771 --> 28:50.946
Now this.

28:54.036 --> 28:55.995
How long have I known you?

28:56.169 --> 28:59.433
Years and years,
by my count.You stand by me.

28:59.607 --> 29:02.392
And in those years,
I'’ve gone and trusted you.

29:02.566 --> 29:06.614
Okay? And that'’s why
what I'’m about to ask
might seem unfair,

29:06.788 --> 29:08.834
but it could save
both our necks.

29:12.359 --> 29:13.490
Spit it out.

29:17.407 --> 29:19.758
I need your family'’s truck...

29:19.932 --> 29:21.629
for good.

29:21.803 --> 29:24.414
I'’ll send you the money
as soon as I get to Mexico.

29:26.852 --> 29:29.376
You getting stupid
on me, Eugene?

29:29.550 --> 29:31.204
We are leaving in it
next week.

29:31.378 --> 29:33.815
What the hell'’s going on?

29:33.989 --> 29:36.687
I can'’t tell you
everything right now,
but I'’ve met somebody.

29:36.862 --> 29:39.168
And they'’re gonna pay me
20,000 to get them to Mexico.

29:39.342 --> 29:40.953
Twenty-thousand!
Do you believe it?

29:41.823 --> 29:43.912
No, Evans, I don'’t.

29:44.086 --> 29:47.089
And even if I did,
shit, I'’d tell you
to eat a toad.

29:50.223 --> 29:52.312
If you'’re saying
what I think you'’re saying,

29:52.486 --> 29:54.183
then me just saying it
could wind me dead.

29:54.357 --> 29:55.924
No, no, no.
No one'’s gonna
wind up dead.

29:56.098 --> 29:58.187
They'’re
chasing me out of town
enough as it is.

29:58.927 --> 30:00.189
Imagine.

30:01.147 --> 30:02.801
A murdering
white lady too?

30:44.494 --> 30:47.019
Two dead dogs.

32:44.484 --> 32:45.485
Dinnertime.

32:52.274 --> 32:53.362
What'’s wrong?

32:55.930 --> 32:57.279
Any luck with
the automobile?

32:58.237 --> 32:59.629
No, not yet.
I'’m still trying.

33:08.029 --> 33:09.509
Are you gonna tell me
what'’s eating you?

33:09.683 --> 33:11.685
I need to get
out of here, Eugene!

33:12.338 --> 33:13.817
Yeah, I know that.

33:14.601 --> 33:17.038
Did something happen?No.

33:17.647 --> 33:18.997
Something could.

33:20.085 --> 33:21.738
It'’s not safe, me being here.

33:22.565 --> 33:23.740
It'’s not safe for anyone.

33:25.133 --> 33:26.221
Yeah, I know.

33:28.223 --> 33:29.790
Just...

33:29.964 --> 33:32.662
I'’m going crazy in here.
I'’m cooped up.

33:32.836 --> 33:35.491
I'’m hurt. I'’m dirty.

33:35.665 --> 33:37.754
Yeah.I'’m sorry, I didn'’t--

33:37.928 --> 33:39.582
I didn'’t mean
to yell at you.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.324
Sorry.

33:48.896 --> 33:51.507
I may have
just thought of something
that will cheer you up.

33:52.247 --> 33:53.553
What'’s that?

34:06.435 --> 34:07.523
You can wash here.

34:08.742 --> 34:10.352
This is a clean
swimming lake.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.575
Property'’s abandoned,
so, we'’re safe.

34:18.447 --> 34:21.972
We can clean your leg
and then dress it after.
How about that?

34:25.715 --> 34:27.239
All right then.

34:54.048 --> 34:55.615
We'’re leaving
in five minutes.

34:59.184 --> 35:01.534
Hey, that'’s for later.

35:01.708 --> 35:02.796
I couldn'’t resist.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.102
Sit down.

35:06.408 --> 35:08.106
Where is Eugene?

35:08.280 --> 35:10.499
I'’m missing my blue dress.
Have you seen it anywhere?

35:10.673 --> 35:12.327
Um, no, Mama.

35:12.501 --> 35:14.068
Hello?

35:14.242 --> 35:16.766
Anyone hear me?
I said, "Where is the boy"?

35:16.940 --> 35:18.681
Him and Joe was out
looking for work.

35:18.855 --> 35:22.337
He said you told him to.
Said he'’s going
to meet us there.

35:33.957 --> 35:35.307
Where are your shoes?

35:35.481 --> 35:37.047
Do I have to wear them?

35:37.222 --> 35:38.701
Yes. Come on.

35:43.793 --> 35:44.794
Oh!

35:53.063 --> 35:54.152
Hello.

35:54.804 --> 35:56.023
Evening.

35:58.286 --> 36:00.375
What are you staring at?

36:00.549 --> 36:01.898
Oh, nothing. I was, uh...

36:03.465 --> 36:06.251
I was just thinking
about my father.

36:06.425 --> 36:10.255
He took me swimming here once
when I was real little.

36:10.429 --> 36:12.561
I'’d forgotten about it
until just now.

36:12.735 --> 36:14.084
He ain'’t around anymore.

36:14.259 --> 36:16.391
You must miss him
pretty bad, huh?

36:16.565 --> 36:18.350
Yeah, I suppose so.

36:20.395 --> 36:23.659
When I wonder
what I miss about him,
I can'’t think of nothin'’.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.141
You know,
I just can'’t remember.

36:27.315 --> 36:28.664
It'’s funny.

36:30.492 --> 36:31.711
Do you ever get that?

36:36.629 --> 36:38.848
You know what the worst
part of dying is, kid?

36:39.022 --> 36:40.850
I didn'’t say he was dead.

36:42.852 --> 36:44.811
But...

36:44.985 --> 36:47.901
when you quit it
with all this "kid" crap,
you can tell me.

36:49.555 --> 36:51.774
You don'’t like it
when I call you kid?

36:54.777 --> 36:56.910
-No.
-

36:57.084 --> 36:58.694
I'’m sorry. I didn'’t
mean it like that.

36:58.868 --> 37:00.174
I didn'’t mean it
like you'’re a kid.

37:00.348 --> 37:03.569
I meant it like...
Billy the Kid.

37:04.396 --> 37:05.832
You know him?

37:06.006 --> 37:08.051
The outlaw. The myth.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.837
Yeah, I know him, but I...

37:11.011 --> 37:12.621
I don'’t like it either way.

37:12.795 --> 37:14.536
And why is that?

37:14.710 --> 37:16.843
Well, '’cause what'’s
the big hoopla about some dummy

37:17.017 --> 37:19.759
that got himself killed
before the age of 30, huh?

37:24.067 --> 37:26.722
This ain'’t about
when he died.

37:30.030 --> 37:31.640
It'’s about
how long he'’ll live.

37:36.471 --> 37:38.343
You see,
the worst part of dying...

37:39.648 --> 37:41.302
is being forgotten.

37:48.701 --> 37:50.311
That'’s why I like Billy.

37:52.052 --> 37:54.750
'’Cause even though
he died before 30,

37:54.924 --> 37:57.579
every couple of years
someone claims
to have seen him.

37:57.753 --> 38:01.366
You know, at the groceries
or riding a freight train.

38:02.671 --> 38:04.717
He'’s like a ghost
out of time.

38:08.373 --> 38:11.941
You see, you can'’t
really die if people still
want you to live.

38:14.770 --> 38:17.164
Not in any meaningful way,
at least.

38:21.908 --> 38:24.302
-Hey! You!
-I thought you said
this place was safe.

38:24.476 --> 38:26.521
-Damn it!
-He was supposed to
be off this land by now.

38:26.695 --> 38:29.045
This is still my land
until the first of next month!

38:29.219 --> 38:30.482
Shit.

38:32.092 --> 38:33.441
Go, go, go. Go!

38:41.493 --> 38:43.277
I don'’t think he saw.
We got to--

39:41.291 --> 39:42.249
Hey.

39:42.423 --> 39:43.859
Have you seen my brother?

39:49.430 --> 39:51.258
Can I pinch a smoke,
please, sir?

39:53.869 --> 39:55.393
You got a light?Yeah.

40:09.755 --> 40:13.715
I'’m telling you,
they should be sending out
search parties still.

40:15.500 --> 40:18.938
Damn sure she'’s still here
with a wound like that.

40:19.112 --> 40:20.505
I hope so.

40:20.679 --> 40:23.159
A little excitement
never hurt no one.

40:23.333 --> 40:26.206
A little excitement
never hurt no one, huh?

40:26.380 --> 40:27.903
You seen the evidence,
Ernie?

40:28.077 --> 40:29.209
Nah, I'’m just saying.

40:29.383 --> 40:30.863
Well, I have.

40:31.603 --> 40:32.865
All of it.

40:33.866 --> 40:35.345
And let me
tell you something.

40:35.520 --> 40:39.088
She don'’t tend
to leave no witnesses.

40:40.481 --> 40:43.353
All kinds of horrors
in that evidence locker.

40:44.659 --> 40:46.922
You hear Hartwell
talking in there?

40:47.096 --> 40:48.837
He said he saw her
just a couple hours ago.

40:49.751 --> 40:51.884
Swimming in that lake of his.

40:52.058 --> 40:54.364
Everybody keeps
claiming they'’ve seen her.

40:54.539 --> 40:56.889
That'’s why we gotta get
all the farmers together,

40:57.063 --> 40:59.326
and we got to search.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.371
Splitting the bounty
won'’t save everyone,

41:01.546 --> 41:03.461
but it will
some of us, Ernie.

41:06.246 --> 41:08.727
I told Ethel I'’d dance
with her to this one.

41:32.881 --> 41:34.622
There'’s my girl.

41:34.796 --> 41:37.320
You gonna
dance with your pa?

41:38.539 --> 41:40.019
Shall we, little lady?

42:14.444 --> 42:17.535
You might be
the worst damn thief
I think I'’ve ever seen.

42:17.709 --> 42:20.146
Shit, Garza, you almost
gave me a coronary.

42:21.016 --> 42:22.017
Run a block, would you?

42:22.191 --> 42:24.367
Hell you think I'’m doing?

42:24.542 --> 42:27.675
Your daddy would'’ve beat
your ass in public already
if it weren'’t for me.

42:29.503 --> 42:31.505
Bingo.

42:31.679 --> 42:33.768
You are up
to some fishy shit,
Eugene Evans.

42:33.942 --> 42:35.944
Yeah, you have no idea.

42:39.600 --> 42:40.906
Ride your bike here?

42:56.748 --> 42:58.358
Sit down. Come on.

43:23.775 --> 43:24.645
Mm-hmm.

44:01.943 --> 44:03.118
Uh-huh!

44:07.775 --> 44:08.776
Ohh!

44:30.145 --> 44:31.059
Punch it!

45:15.321 --> 45:16.844
-Whoa!
-

45:17.018 --> 45:18.803
You ain'’t supposed
to be in here.

45:18.977 --> 45:20.108
I'’m sorry, sir.

45:21.327 --> 45:24.460
I was just getting this
for my-- for my old man.

45:24.634 --> 45:26.811
-He wanted to take
a look at it at home.
-Who'’s your old man?

45:26.985 --> 45:28.508
Uh, Deputy Evans.

45:28.682 --> 45:31.816
I have his keys.You'’re Eugene Evans?

45:32.599 --> 45:34.906
Uh, yeah, sir. Yeah.

45:35.645 --> 45:37.865
Well, George knows better,

45:38.039 --> 45:40.259
but, uh, I understand
he'’s got a bug up his ass

45:40.433 --> 45:41.739
about this whole situation
we got here.

45:41.913 --> 45:43.741
Yeah, yeah. Sure has, yeah.

45:43.915 --> 45:45.786
All right, well,
take him what he needs.

45:45.960 --> 45:48.354
Yes, I will, sir. Thank you.All right.

45:48.528 --> 45:51.531
Hey.
Tell your ma I say hi.

45:52.097 --> 45:53.228
Yes, sir.

45:59.757 --> 46:03.717
-

46:48.718 --> 46:50.155
You found her, ain'’t ya?

46:51.199 --> 46:52.548
The Wells lady.

46:55.725 --> 46:58.685
I ain'’t going to tell nobody,
if that'’s what
you'’re worried about.

47:00.469 --> 47:02.384
-You ain'’t?
-Not if you tell me why

47:02.558 --> 47:04.996
you'’ve been such a creeping,
little toad lately.

47:06.519 --> 47:09.000
It'’s complicated. Complex.

47:14.527 --> 47:15.876
I'’m scared.

47:30.282 --> 47:31.805
I know.

47:32.850 --> 47:34.329
It scares me too.

47:35.461 --> 47:37.289
Everything'’s gonna be
all right.

47:37.463 --> 47:38.812
I promise.

47:40.161 --> 47:41.771
Show me that smile.

47:44.078 --> 47:45.775
Come on.
You want a ride back?Yeah.

47:45.950 --> 47:47.081
Okay.

47:47.255 --> 47:49.083
Three, two, one.

47:52.217 --> 47:55.350
I saw a change
in my brother that night.

47:55.524 --> 47:59.746
There was a resolve in his eyes I'’d never seen before.

47:59.920 --> 48:03.750
Like something invisible
that had tied him
to our world came undone

48:04.751 --> 48:07.406
and set off
a series of events

48:07.580 --> 48:10.365
that would change the shape
of our family forever.

48:18.243 --> 48:20.071
Maybe if I'’d known
his father,

48:20.245 --> 48:22.073
I would have
recognized that look.

48:27.687 --> 48:29.471
Sheriff wants to see you
in his office.

48:29.645 --> 48:31.169
I'’m looking
for him too, Janice.

48:31.343 --> 48:32.866
George.What'’s up?

48:33.649 --> 48:36.696
Sir, she is still here.

48:36.870 --> 48:39.133
I found that on the edge
of the Hartwell property

48:39.307 --> 48:42.223
after he claimed
that he had seen her.

48:42.397 --> 48:44.965
And no one'’s safe
until we find her.

48:45.139 --> 48:48.664
Now, the way I see it,
is if we raise the bounty,

48:48.838 --> 48:52.233
we could get every farmer
and every farmhand

48:52.407 --> 48:54.975
in the county on her ass.

48:57.586 --> 49:00.633
What the fuck do you think
I brought you in here for?

49:03.505 --> 49:07.161
-Huh?
-You send your boy in here
at night to steal evidence

49:07.335 --> 49:10.121
and expect me
not to fire your ass?

49:33.535 --> 49:35.146
Where you been, kid?

49:40.499 --> 49:42.414
I know about Perry Montroy.

49:51.292 --> 49:52.815
You lied about him.

49:55.166 --> 49:56.994
You could be lying
about everything.

50:06.307 --> 50:10.877
I didn'’t--
I didn'’t tell you about him
because it'’s hard to talk about.

50:13.401 --> 50:15.012
Was you in love with him?

50:17.927 --> 50:19.581
Are you jealous?

50:25.370 --> 50:26.632
Yeah.

51:00.318 --> 51:02.276
I'’ve never seen
anything like it.

51:05.975 --> 51:07.368
You'’re right.

51:08.326 --> 51:10.197
It ain'’t safe for you here.

51:12.765 --> 51:15.072
Or for any of us,
for that matter.

51:16.551 --> 51:18.901
You said 20,000, right?

51:19.076 --> 51:20.903
Find me a car,
and I'’m history.

51:22.731 --> 51:24.951
Same as your family debt.

51:32.524 --> 51:34.569
Oh, shit.
George is back early.

51:49.541 --> 51:51.717
Sheriff cut me loose.

51:53.458 --> 51:55.024
The evidence you took,
where is it?

51:56.243 --> 51:58.506
It'’s gone.Gone where?

51:58.680 --> 52:00.117
I forget.

52:01.901 --> 52:04.425
Okay, all that stuff was
lies and made-up nonsense!

52:04.599 --> 52:07.036
Where in God'’s creation
you get the idea of calling
that woman innocent?

52:07.211 --> 52:09.126
-Well, I know things.
-Oh, you "know things"!

52:09.300 --> 52:11.911
The apple don'’t fall far
from the tree, now, does it?

52:12.085 --> 52:13.956
Full of foolish thoughts,
like your old man.

52:14.131 --> 52:15.436
Well, I may have raised you,

52:15.610 --> 52:17.395
but you sure as shit
ain'’t my son.

52:17.569 --> 52:19.136
Well, thank God for that.

52:20.441 --> 52:22.008
Son of a--

52:23.531 --> 52:26.665
Where is it, huh? Huh?

52:26.839 --> 52:29.450
You'’re gonna break your
mama'’s heart when you
end up dead like John Baker.

52:29.624 --> 52:31.757
But he ain'’t dead.
He'’s in Mexico.

52:31.931 --> 52:33.498
I'’m gonna find him
one day.

52:33.672 --> 52:35.239
Sure.

52:35.413 --> 52:36.631
Mexico.

52:38.807 --> 52:42.724
And this door,
from here on out, stays open.

52:44.857 --> 52:45.901
Shit.

53:12.624 --> 53:15.061
Come on. Shit.

53:15.235 --> 53:16.497
Shit.

53:40.042 --> 53:41.261
Don'’t stop now.

53:44.873 --> 53:47.789
Oh, God. It'’s fine.
It'’s fine.

53:47.963 --> 53:49.704
I'’m seeing stars, Allison.

53:50.314 --> 53:52.054
No. No!

53:52.838 --> 53:54.796
No, no, you can make it.

53:54.970 --> 53:57.234
Come on. We can make it.
Come on.

53:57.408 --> 53:58.626
Keep running.

54:00.367 --> 54:02.500
No. No.

54:10.116 --> 54:11.726
I'’ll see you in Mexico.

54:55.683 --> 54:56.945
Jesus.

54:58.077 --> 54:59.818
Hey, Papa.

54:59.992 --> 55:01.254
Glad you'’re home.

55:04.083 --> 55:05.476
What'’s wrong now?

55:17.705 --> 55:19.446
No, you ought
to stay inside.

55:19.620 --> 55:21.796
If he'’s hiding it,
it'’s in that barn.

55:22.362 --> 55:23.581
Don'’t.

55:23.755 --> 55:25.365
That boy needs his mother.

55:27.280 --> 55:30.283
Maybe he'’ll tell you
what the hell is going on.

56:02.968 --> 56:05.144
George, he'’s sorry
what happened.

56:06.754 --> 56:09.017
But he told me
what you did.

56:12.281 --> 56:13.544
Just trying to help.

56:13.718 --> 56:15.502
Help who?

56:16.155 --> 56:18.026
George was dismissed.

56:19.898 --> 56:22.204
Eugene, look at me.

56:22.379 --> 56:25.643
We'’re less than a month away
from being homeless.

56:30.387 --> 56:32.563
George said
John Baker was dead.

56:35.783 --> 56:37.655
And he was right.

56:39.047 --> 56:44.052
Do you remember that postcard
he wrote you when you were six?

56:44.923 --> 56:46.185
Of course, I do.

56:47.491 --> 56:49.188
Yeah, well, he sent more.

56:50.450 --> 56:52.974
But I burned every one of them
after the first.

56:55.281 --> 56:57.196
Every month, he'’d write,
and every month,

56:57.370 --> 56:59.590
each card was worse
than the last.

56:59.764 --> 57:03.289
They'’d be full of talk
about God and people

57:03.463 --> 57:06.814
and strange things he'’d seen,
but it was all jumbled up.

57:06.988 --> 57:11.863
He was drinking himself
to death, and his mind
was falling apart.

57:13.908 --> 57:17.172
I couldn'’t let a little boy
read what he wrote.

57:18.565 --> 57:20.567
I only lied
because I love you.

57:20.741 --> 57:24.223
-You'’re lying to me now, Mama.
-No, Eugene, I'’m not.

57:24.397 --> 57:27.661
After five years,
the cards stopped.

57:27.835 --> 57:30.577
And I believe that was
'’cause he died.

57:30.751 --> 57:33.580
No. No, you can'’t be sure
of that. You can'’t.

57:33.754 --> 57:34.712
Eugene!

57:35.974 --> 57:37.497
Eugene, I...

57:40.282 --> 57:41.719
I'’m sorry.

57:41.893 --> 57:43.198
Oh, God.

58:22.150 --> 58:23.500
He shut that door?

58:24.631 --> 58:25.719
I did.

58:38.210 --> 58:40.647
He say anything meaningful
about what he done?

58:43.389 --> 58:44.521
No.

58:48.568 --> 58:52.137
I need your help
with this, George.
He ain'’t going nowhere.

59:01.625 --> 59:04.541
That day came to be known
as "Black Sunday."

59:07.500 --> 59:10.590
It was the worst storm Childress County had ever seen.

59:14.638 --> 59:16.074
And for Eugene,

59:16.248 --> 59:18.119
just the sign he needed.

59:52.676 --> 59:56.462
Phoebe... I'’m leaving.

59:56.636 --> 59:58.725
Okay, I'’m going.
I'’m here to say goodbye.

59:58.899 --> 1:00:01.075
Take me with you.

1:00:01.249 --> 1:00:02.642
You don'’t even know
where we'’re going.

1:00:02.816 --> 1:00:03.861
That don'’t matter.

1:00:04.035 --> 1:00:06.472
Phoebe, we'’re going
to Mexico.

1:00:06.646 --> 1:00:09.518
Mexico. I'’ll learn
Spanish, okay?

1:00:09.693 --> 1:00:11.912
No. You gotta stay here.

1:00:13.827 --> 1:00:15.524
I'’m gonna send money.
I'’m gonna send lots of it.

1:00:15.699 --> 1:00:18.179
Where you getting money?Well, that don'’t matter,
does it?

1:00:18.919 --> 1:00:20.225
This is a good thing.

1:00:20.399 --> 1:00:22.575
Why you doing this?

1:00:27.972 --> 1:00:29.538
I guess I'’m in love.

1:00:29.713 --> 1:00:31.715
You don'’t know
anything about love.

1:00:31.889 --> 1:00:33.891
You don'’t neither.

1:00:34.065 --> 1:00:36.415
I know that if you loved us,
you'’d stay.

1:00:36.589 --> 1:00:38.722
-If you loved me.
-Phoebe, I do love you.

1:00:38.896 --> 1:00:40.419
Well, then stay.

1:00:47.644 --> 1:00:48.993
I'’ll see you soon.

1:00:50.342 --> 1:00:51.386
I promise.

1:00:52.257 --> 1:00:55.347
Just go.
Quit drawing it out.

1:01:28.859 --> 1:01:31.252
I held my breath
that whole night...

1:01:32.427 --> 1:01:34.299
and I imagined I was him...

1:01:36.301 --> 1:01:39.304
laying in the same bed
after his father left.

1:01:44.309 --> 1:01:49.314
Once the storm passed,
George checked the barn.

1:01:49.488 --> 1:01:52.273
But to his disappointment,
he found nothing.

1:01:52.447 --> 1:01:53.622
Food'’s ready.

1:01:55.624 --> 1:01:57.148
Can you wake the boy?

1:02:10.770 --> 1:02:12.511
Gene?

1:02:23.478 --> 1:02:24.349
Oh, shit!

1:02:25.437 --> 1:02:27.308
Oh...

1:02:27.482 --> 1:02:29.354
He went away
with that lady.

1:02:29.528 --> 1:02:31.399
What lady?
What are you talking about?

1:02:31.573 --> 1:02:33.750
Allison Wells,
the fugitive.

1:02:33.924 --> 1:02:35.316
Why are you saying that?

1:02:35.490 --> 1:02:37.014
Because I'’m
telling the truth.

1:02:37.188 --> 1:02:38.624
The damn truck'’s gone.

1:02:40.539 --> 1:02:44.238
Papa! Papa, Phoebe here'’s
been saying strange things
about her brother.

1:02:44.412 --> 1:02:46.763
I want you to tell her
they isn'’t true.

1:02:47.938 --> 1:02:49.809
What things
she been saying?

1:02:49.983 --> 1:02:53.291
She says Eugene'’s been helping
Allison Wells, the fugitive?

1:02:54.161 --> 1:02:55.728
But that just isn'’t possible.

1:02:55.902 --> 1:02:58.122
It'’s just
a little girl'’s fantasy.

1:02:58.296 --> 1:03:00.994
No, it ain'’t.

1:03:02.909 --> 1:03:06.130
Phoebe, you best tell us
where he'’s gone.

1:03:09.350 --> 1:03:11.962
You don'’t want your brother
to get hurt, now, do you?

1:03:21.275 --> 1:03:24.365
I'’m gonna miss you,
but I hate goodbyes.

1:03:24.539 --> 1:03:26.628
You should pull over soon.
We don'’t draw this one out.

1:03:26.803 --> 1:03:28.805
No, no, no. There ain'’t
gonna be any goodbyes.

1:03:28.979 --> 1:03:31.198
You don'’t gotta
fret about it.

1:03:34.593 --> 1:03:36.508
Oh, no. Kid, no.

1:03:36.682 --> 1:03:39.119
I'’m going to Mexico alone.

1:03:39.728 --> 1:03:40.729
Afraid not.

1:03:40.904 --> 1:03:43.384
Afraid so.

1:03:43.558 --> 1:03:45.604
What about your family?
You just gonna leave '’em?

1:03:46.910 --> 1:03:48.520
You know what, Allison?

1:03:49.782 --> 1:03:52.089
I'’ve got family
in Mexico too.

1:03:52.785 --> 1:03:54.091
Your father.

1:03:54.265 --> 1:03:55.179
Right.

1:03:56.049 --> 1:03:57.311
John Baker.

1:03:58.530 --> 1:04:00.532
High damn time
I track him down.

1:04:00.706 --> 1:04:03.622
I don'’t think you understand
what it entails
to find somebody,

1:04:03.796 --> 1:04:05.450
let alone in Mexico.

1:04:05.624 --> 1:04:07.974
What does it matter to you
if I come to Mexico or not,
huh?

1:04:08.148 --> 1:04:11.978
It matters '’cause you'’re in
love with me, and you expect--No. No. No, I ain'’t.

1:04:17.462 --> 1:04:18.898
You know what, Allison?

1:04:20.291 --> 1:04:23.076
Last night I said to myself,
there is no way in hell

1:04:23.250 --> 1:04:25.383
that you'’re going to Mexico
by yourself.

1:04:26.906 --> 1:04:28.952
There ain'’t.

1:04:29.126 --> 1:04:33.217
So, whether you love me back
or not is besides the point.

1:04:34.914 --> 1:04:36.524
I don'’t love you back.

1:04:38.787 --> 1:04:41.878
Well... it'’s a long drive.

1:04:49.276 --> 1:04:50.930
God, what did I do wrong?

1:04:51.104 --> 1:04:53.019
How did they
come across one another?

1:04:53.193 --> 1:04:56.849
I don'’t know,
but if word gets out that
that woman was hiding here,

1:04:57.023 --> 1:04:59.460
and I'’m not the one
to bring her in...

1:04:59.634 --> 1:05:01.288
Makes me sick
to even think about.

1:05:01.462 --> 1:05:03.900
You think I care right now
about any of that?

1:05:04.074 --> 1:05:06.032
What'’s gonna happen
to my son, George?

1:05:06.206 --> 1:05:08.252
I'’m calling Tade,
and I'’m calling Lomax.

1:05:08.426 --> 1:05:10.819
We'’re gonna find him
before anyone else does.

1:05:12.082 --> 1:05:13.997
Tade? George Evans.

1:05:14.171 --> 1:05:15.737
Have you still got
that buck shooter?

1:05:15.912 --> 1:05:17.522
Don'’t shoot my son, George!Hey!

1:05:17.696 --> 1:05:20.394
Ain'’t no one getting shot
until he'’s free and clear.

1:05:20.568 --> 1:05:21.918
All right, Tade,
bring the vehicle.

1:05:22.092 --> 1:05:23.397
Mine'’s on the fritz.

1:05:26.183 --> 1:05:28.881
We stand to get
a third of the bounty.

1:05:31.014 --> 1:05:33.190
-Then we can stay.
-Just bring my son back to me,

1:05:33.364 --> 1:05:36.149
or you don'’t bother
coming back.

1:05:49.162 --> 1:05:50.947
Goddamn it.

1:05:52.209 --> 1:05:54.385
Turn back, you bastard.

1:05:57.388 --> 1:05:59.390
What do we do, Allison?

1:06:00.913 --> 1:06:03.002
Do you have the gun?

1:06:03.176 --> 1:06:05.831
No, we ain'’t using--Please, tell me
you have the gun.

1:06:07.702 --> 1:06:09.878
We ain'’t using it though,
right, Allison?

1:06:10.053 --> 1:06:13.273
Not if we don'’t have to,
but we do have to pull over.

1:06:14.405 --> 1:06:16.059
Shit.

1:06:16.233 --> 1:06:18.844
I want to report
a car stolen.

1:06:19.018 --> 1:06:20.063
Yeah.

1:06:20.237 --> 1:06:25.764
License plate number 3285M8.

1:06:48.047 --> 1:06:50.093
What'’s the problem, sir?

1:06:50.267 --> 1:06:53.922
Well, the problem is
you ran a clearly placed
stop sign.

1:06:55.141 --> 1:06:56.925
You leave your good sense
at home, son?

1:06:57.100 --> 1:06:59.928
Oh, uh, no, sir.

1:07:00.103 --> 1:07:03.976
I'’m sorry. I didn'’t see
the stop sign till
it was too late, that'’s all.

1:07:05.369 --> 1:07:07.023
Where you headed and why?

1:07:08.154 --> 1:07:10.548
I'’m going to Lubbock.

1:07:10.722 --> 1:07:12.767
Gonna pick up a part
for my old man.

1:07:12.941 --> 1:07:14.726
His tiller'’s broke, so...

1:07:14.900 --> 1:07:15.944
Who'’s your old man?

1:07:17.250 --> 1:07:19.557
John Baker of Bismark.

1:07:21.211 --> 1:07:22.299
I don'’t know him.

1:07:24.779 --> 1:07:26.477
You know, there'’s
a fugitive about.

1:07:26.651 --> 1:07:30.176
A lady. All armed
and ready to kill.

1:07:30.350 --> 1:07:32.048
Yeah, I heard about that.

1:07:33.266 --> 1:07:34.615
Yeah, she ain'’t
the kind of folk

1:07:34.789 --> 1:07:37.488
that I associate with,
so I ain'’t seen her.

1:07:37.662 --> 1:07:41.448
If I do, I'’ll be sure
to let the authorities know.

1:07:41.622 --> 1:07:45.800
What'’s your name, son?
I'’m gonna write you a citation,
then you'’re free to go.

1:07:46.627 --> 1:07:48.151
Uh, Eugene Baker.

1:07:51.632 --> 1:07:52.764
Slow down.

1:07:52.938 --> 1:07:54.809
I will. Thank you, sir.

1:08:12.175 --> 1:08:14.438
You fucking did it!

1:08:14.612 --> 1:08:16.222
That'’s right.

1:08:16.396 --> 1:08:17.963
Well, you may not be
the worst person

1:08:18.137 --> 1:08:19.747
to go on a trip with
after all.

1:08:30.062 --> 1:08:31.890
Mama?Huh?

1:08:33.021 --> 1:08:35.720
Eugene has to have someone
looking out for him.

1:08:35.894 --> 1:08:37.374
More than just Papa.

1:08:37.548 --> 1:08:38.592
Hmm?

1:08:38.766 --> 1:08:40.377
What the hell
you saying?

1:08:42.379 --> 1:08:45.947
No, you'’re not setting foot
outside this house
till this is over.

1:08:46.122 --> 1:08:48.689
Not another word on that.
Just go to your room.

1:08:48.863 --> 1:08:49.864
Close the door.

1:08:56.001 --> 1:08:57.655
Morning, Mrs. Evans.

1:08:58.612 --> 1:09:00.832
Eugene'’s going
to be A-okay.

1:09:07.317 --> 1:09:08.535
Evans.

1:09:11.582 --> 1:09:12.800
Uh-huh.

1:09:14.019 --> 1:09:15.542
Is that so?

1:09:15.716 --> 1:09:17.979
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It'’s just my boy.

1:09:18.154 --> 1:09:20.765
Sorry for the mix-up.
I'’ll handle it myself.

1:09:20.939 --> 1:09:22.332
I appreciate that.

1:09:23.768 --> 1:09:25.770
They'’re near Matador,
heading south.

1:09:25.944 --> 1:09:28.425
Someone must'’ve reported
my truck stolen.

1:09:28.599 --> 1:09:29.991
Let'’s go, boys.

1:09:40.785 --> 1:09:43.918
Phoebe? Come here.

1:09:46.530 --> 1:09:48.140
Phoebe!

1:09:56.366 --> 1:09:58.063
Phoe-- Phoebe.

1:09:58.237 --> 1:10:00.196
No, no, no, no. No!

1:10:00.370 --> 1:10:01.980
Come back!

1:10:13.905 --> 1:10:17.735
You ain'’t gonna believe
the green when we get out
of these forsaken parts.

1:10:17.909 --> 1:10:21.782
There'’s rivers of it,
just rolling and rolling.

1:10:23.131 --> 1:10:26.222
I'’m telling you, there'’s,
like, bright green orchards...

1:10:27.310 --> 1:10:28.833
bright blue waters.

1:10:29.007 --> 1:10:31.401
I'’ve seen a tree before,
you know?

1:10:31.575 --> 1:10:33.794
Yeah, well, have you
seen the ocean?

1:10:34.926 --> 1:10:37.624
No. No, I haven'’t.

1:10:37.798 --> 1:10:41.019
I used to dream
a lot about it
when I was a kid.

1:10:41.193 --> 1:10:44.675
Not sure exactly what
it'’s supposed to look
or feel like, though.

1:10:46.067 --> 1:10:47.243
Have you seen it?

1:10:47.417 --> 1:10:50.420
No, but I used to
dream about it too.

1:10:52.335 --> 1:10:57.296
I plan on running
into its big, burly arms
when we get to Mexico.

1:11:00.168 --> 1:11:01.735
Yeah, that sounds nice.

1:11:02.736 --> 1:11:04.172
Yeah.

1:11:18.970 --> 1:11:20.624
Phoebe.

1:11:22.016 --> 1:11:23.366
Hi, Papa.

1:11:43.342 --> 1:11:45.649
No. No, you should
stay here.

1:11:45.823 --> 1:11:47.651
No, thank you.
I need to stretch my leg.

1:11:47.825 --> 1:11:49.696
Allison, the clerk
might recognize you.

1:11:49.870 --> 1:11:52.873
And once we'’re gone,
he'’ll tell everyone
how pretty I was.

1:11:53.047 --> 1:11:54.875
Here, take this with you.

1:11:55.049 --> 1:11:57.269
Let'’s just see what
we'’re working with here.

1:12:17.811 --> 1:12:20.379
-Evening.
-Evening yourself, handsome.

1:12:22.642 --> 1:12:24.340
How are you doing
on this lonesome night?

1:12:24.514 --> 1:12:26.254
Can'’t complain.

1:12:26.429 --> 1:12:27.908
Sign says
you have vacancies.

1:12:28.082 --> 1:12:30.258
That'’s right.
One room or two?

1:12:30.433 --> 1:12:31.477
One.

1:12:43.968 --> 1:12:45.622
You'’re Room 17.

1:12:45.796 --> 1:12:46.971
You'’re too kind.

1:12:47.145 --> 1:12:48.320
Thank you, sir.

1:12:50.714 --> 1:12:52.455
That was the last
of our money.

1:12:53.499 --> 1:12:54.718
Yep.

1:12:56.110 --> 1:12:57.373
We'’ll get more.

1:13:13.214 --> 1:13:14.912
I'’m gonna shower.

1:13:33.104 --> 1:13:34.410
Hey, kid.

1:13:36.542 --> 1:13:38.370
Why don'’t you come in here?

1:13:47.988 --> 1:13:50.513
Ah, God, feels like heaven.

1:13:55.518 --> 1:13:56.823
You want to shower?

1:14:03.264 --> 1:14:04.614
You afraid?

1:14:06.050 --> 1:14:07.312
No.

1:14:09.836 --> 1:14:11.447
Are you embarrassed?

1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:16.190
Why do you want me
in there with you?

1:14:19.150 --> 1:14:20.630
What do you mean "why"?

1:14:21.457 --> 1:14:23.328
That'’s a funny question.

1:14:23.502 --> 1:14:25.461
Seems reasonable
enough to me.

1:14:25.635 --> 1:14:27.985
Jesus, you want me
to drag you in?

1:14:31.597 --> 1:14:33.817
Thinking too hard
about this, kid.

1:14:36.036 --> 1:14:38.256
There it is again.

1:14:38.430 --> 1:14:42.216
I'’m "kid,"
but that dingbat behind
the desk, he'’s "handsome"?

1:14:45.524 --> 1:14:47.570
You need me
to call you handsome?

1:14:49.136 --> 1:14:51.312
No, I-- I just--

1:14:51.487 --> 1:14:55.578
Did I ask the dingbat
behind the desk to get
in the shower with me?

1:14:55.752 --> 1:14:57.971
Well, maybe if he
was here, you would.

1:15:00.539 --> 1:15:03.063
Wow. Fuck you.

1:15:07.590 --> 1:15:09.069
All I'’m saying...

1:15:10.810 --> 1:15:12.769
All I'’m saying is,

1:15:12.943 --> 1:15:16.424
I don'’t know if you
actually want me here or...

1:15:16.599 --> 1:15:19.166
are you just saying that
because you'’re trying to
get me to stick around

1:15:19.340 --> 1:15:21.386
'’cause you'’re afraid
I'’ll turn you in.

1:15:32.963 --> 1:15:35.661
You wouldn'’t be here
if I didn'’t want you here.

1:15:37.576 --> 1:15:39.709
You know that
as well as I do.

1:16:35.286 --> 1:16:36.983
I apologize.

1:16:37.157 --> 1:16:38.289
Thank you.

1:16:40.552 --> 1:16:43.729
But I need to make something
crystal-fucking-clear.

1:16:46.689 --> 1:16:48.125
This was your choice.

1:16:50.083 --> 1:16:51.694
I didn'’t ask you to come.

1:16:53.043 --> 1:16:55.741
Okay? You insisted.

1:16:55.915 --> 1:16:57.525
And you talk a great game.

1:16:57.700 --> 1:17:00.006
And hell, I'’m accustomed
to your company.

1:17:02.443 --> 1:17:09.189
But if you have any doubts
about being here right now,
you need to go home.

1:17:09.973 --> 1:17:12.236
Go home. Be a kid again.

1:17:14.978 --> 1:17:18.242
Okay? '’Cause every second
you spend here,

1:17:18.416 --> 1:17:19.896
that option gets slimmer
and slimmer.

1:17:20.070 --> 1:17:21.854
You understand that,
right?

1:17:25.641 --> 1:17:27.643
This ain'’t a world
for kids.

1:17:31.908 --> 1:17:33.083
It'’s ugly.

1:17:36.303 --> 1:17:37.609
Ugly.

1:17:52.232 --> 1:17:54.191
I ain'’t going nowhere.

1:17:56.280 --> 1:17:58.586
I want to reach
the ocean with you.

1:18:09.641 --> 1:18:11.948
Your skin'’s so soft.

1:18:20.565 --> 1:18:21.871
Okay?

1:18:27.354 --> 1:18:29.705
I'’m sorry.

1:18:33.883 --> 1:18:35.928
I think I need
some sleep.

1:19:16.882 --> 1:19:18.754
Have you ever
done this before?

1:19:21.278 --> 1:19:22.888
No.Lay down.

1:19:38.599 --> 1:19:39.992
You okay?

1:19:40.558 --> 1:19:42.168
Yeah.

1:19:42.342 --> 1:19:43.604
You sure?

1:19:50.873 --> 1:19:52.178
I just wanna...

1:19:54.137 --> 1:19:55.791
I want to be good.

1:20:00.230 --> 1:20:01.840
Okay, I'’ll show you.

1:20:22.730 --> 1:20:25.733
I don'’t really know what'’s
gonna happen now, but...

1:20:27.474 --> 1:20:28.736
can you, um...

1:20:30.564 --> 1:20:32.001
Can you just
close your eyes?

1:20:34.394 --> 1:20:37.310
Why?Just... close '’em.

1:20:47.930 --> 1:20:49.888
I think you should have it.

1:20:52.456 --> 1:20:53.761
You don'’t like it?

1:20:55.024 --> 1:20:56.721
Won'’t it remind you of him?

1:20:57.983 --> 1:20:59.898
You seeing me wearing it?

1:21:06.557 --> 1:21:09.865
Wherever Perry is,
the last thing he needs
is a watch.

1:21:14.652 --> 1:21:17.655
Besides,
I want it to remind me
of someone else.

1:21:33.540 --> 1:21:35.368
I believe that Allison Wells

1:21:35.542 --> 1:21:37.762
did come to love
my brother back.

1:21:37.936 --> 1:21:41.244
And that she was truthful, for the most part.

1:21:43.463 --> 1:21:46.858
Maybe it'’s on account of how badly I miss Eugene...

1:21:49.469 --> 1:21:51.167
but I'’ve always imagined

1:21:51.341 --> 1:21:53.473
that, for a moment,

1:21:53.647 --> 1:21:55.649
the world appeared
before him

1:21:55.823 --> 1:21:59.262
the way he always
dreamed it would.

1:21:59.436 --> 1:22:03.919
In that moment, Eugene and Allison were bound together by the dream.

1:22:06.617 --> 1:22:08.793
One they believed
they were in control of.

1:22:12.014 --> 1:22:15.931
I never been too concerned
with whose idea
the next part was.

1:22:18.281 --> 1:22:19.891
It never really
mattered much to me.

1:22:23.460 --> 1:22:27.159
There are certain conditions to the life Eugene dreamed of

1:22:27.333 --> 1:22:31.120
that I'’m sure Allison
wished she could have
kept secret from him.

1:22:34.427 --> 1:22:37.778
Prices she hoped to have paid for the both of them.

1:22:45.873 --> 1:22:49.573
There'’s no going back. Okay?
We'’re in and we'’re out.

1:22:49.747 --> 1:22:52.793
Two minutes is all it takes.
Keep an eye on that watch.

1:23:02.151 --> 1:23:03.587
Kiss me.

1:23:10.333 --> 1:23:11.725
Count to five.

1:23:16.295 --> 1:23:18.994
Pardon me.
I'’m going to need that.

1:23:19.907 --> 1:23:21.083
This is a holdup!

1:23:22.562 --> 1:23:24.564
Everybody kiss the ground!

1:23:24.738 --> 1:23:27.915
Shut up! Shut up!
Get on the goddamn floor!

1:23:28.090 --> 1:23:30.396
I don'’t need you back there,
ma'’am. Get out.

1:23:30.570 --> 1:23:32.050
Everybody, calm down!You can stay.

1:23:32.224 --> 1:23:34.618
Please,
this is a family bank.

1:23:34.792 --> 1:23:36.707
I'’m not falling
for that, lady.We ain'’t insured.

1:23:36.881 --> 1:23:40.798
Everybody, calm down! Everybody!
Tell '’em! Tell '’em now!

1:23:40.972 --> 1:23:42.539
Do it.
Do as you'’re told.

1:23:42.713 --> 1:23:44.149
What now, Allison?

1:23:44.323 --> 1:23:45.629
You know what to do, ma'’am.

1:23:45.803 --> 1:23:47.283
Faster you go,
the faster we leave.

1:23:47.457 --> 1:23:50.460
Please, hear me.
We are not--Oh, I hear you.

1:23:50.634 --> 1:23:51.939
Now, hear me.

1:23:52.114 --> 1:23:53.985
I want you to open
that little safe back there.

1:23:54.159 --> 1:23:55.856
Me and my partner
can get out of your hair.

1:23:56.031 --> 1:23:57.162
Come on!

1:23:57.336 --> 1:23:58.903
How'’s it going
over there, Allison?

1:23:59.077 --> 1:24:00.470
Tell him how good
it'’s going, lady.

1:24:00.644 --> 1:24:02.341
Good! Good!
It'’s going good!

1:24:02.515 --> 1:24:03.777
That'’s right.
Real good, kid.

1:24:03.951 --> 1:24:05.388
It'’s going well.
It'’s going okay.

1:24:05.562 --> 1:24:07.564
Everybody, just do
as you'’re told. Stay down.

1:24:07.738 --> 1:24:09.696
It'’s going to be over
before you know it, okay?

1:24:09.870 --> 1:24:11.655
Thank you.
That will be all, folks.

1:24:17.530 --> 1:24:18.879
Eugene, come on.

1:24:27.497 --> 1:24:28.454
Go!

1:24:43.165 --> 1:24:46.603
Just breathe.
Come on, Eugene.
We can'’t stop.

1:24:46.777 --> 1:24:49.171
-We can'’t--
not till we get to Mexico.
- You gotta pull over.

1:24:49.345 --> 1:24:50.476
Pull over!

1:24:53.784 --> 1:24:55.699
Eugene, please.

1:24:56.830 --> 1:24:58.484
Eugene?

1:25:03.794 --> 1:25:06.188
Eugene, please,
we really gotta keep going.

1:25:09.191 --> 1:25:10.627
Kid, we gotta move.

1:25:14.500 --> 1:25:16.850
Kid, please, get in the car.

1:25:17.024 --> 1:25:19.897
One dead. Citizens Pride Bank in Stanley.

1:25:20.071 --> 1:25:24.293
Two fugitives,
including Allison Wells,
are heading south on 281.

1:25:24.467 --> 1:25:29.515
South, black truck on 281. License plate number 3285M8.

1:25:29.689 --> 1:25:31.213
I repeat--That'’s them.

1:25:32.518 --> 1:25:34.129
Goddamn!

1:25:39.090 --> 1:25:40.787
I can imagine how
you'’re feeling right now,

1:25:40.961 --> 1:25:42.833
and I know that feeling
ain'’t about to go away,

1:25:43.007 --> 1:25:44.922
but you need to have
that feeling in the car,

1:25:45.096 --> 1:25:46.402
or we'’re gonna get
our asses killed.

1:25:46.576 --> 1:25:48.447
He should have
just stayed lying there.

1:25:48.621 --> 1:25:50.319
Yeah, he should'’ve,

1:25:50.493 --> 1:25:52.582
but he got arrogant,
and he got stupid.

1:25:52.756 --> 1:25:54.758
I wasn'’t even thinking.
I just-- I just did it.

1:25:54.932 --> 1:25:56.803
Because you had to.

1:25:56.977 --> 1:25:58.892
Eugene, it would have
been me otherwise.

1:25:59.763 --> 1:26:01.068
And if someone
had to die today,

1:26:01.243 --> 1:26:02.853
I'’m sure glad
that choice was yours.

1:26:03.636 --> 1:26:05.899
A man is dead because of me.

1:26:06.073 --> 1:26:08.598
I know.
I know how you feel.

1:26:08.772 --> 1:26:10.774
I know how you feel,
but we need to move.

1:26:10.948 --> 1:26:12.776
You need to get
in the car, Eugene.

1:26:12.950 --> 1:26:14.865
Allison, I don'’t think
you understand.

1:26:15.039 --> 1:26:16.519
I don'’t think I can do this.

1:26:16.693 --> 1:26:18.260
I do understand--You don'’t!

1:26:18.434 --> 1:26:20.044
I understand! Maybe
"I understand" doesn'’t mean

1:26:20.218 --> 1:26:22.742
I'’m just gonna sit down
and wait to die myself.

1:26:28.444 --> 1:26:29.967
How would you understand?

1:26:33.013 --> 1:26:34.276
Eugene, please.

1:26:34.450 --> 1:26:35.886
Please, get in
the goddamn car.

1:26:36.060 --> 1:26:37.409
Who did you kill, Allison?

1:26:42.806 --> 1:26:45.156
You'’re everything
they said you was, ain'’t ya?

1:26:50.683 --> 1:26:53.947
I don'’t know if it was me
who killed her.How could you not know?

1:26:55.079 --> 1:26:56.646
Because it was happening
all at the same time.

1:26:56.820 --> 1:26:58.213
If you weren'’t there,

1:26:58.387 --> 1:27:01.172
would that girl
still be alive today?

1:27:09.267 --> 1:27:11.574
You made me into something
that I ain'’t.

1:27:11.748 --> 1:27:15.230
I didn'’t make you
into anything you didn'’t
already want to be.

1:27:21.192 --> 1:27:24.108
-Eugene.

1:27:26.980 --> 1:27:28.286
Please.

1:27:37.339 --> 1:27:38.427
Eugene!

1:27:41.865 --> 1:27:43.040
Ain'’t that your truck?

1:27:45.825 --> 1:27:47.262
Eugene!

1:27:53.180 --> 1:27:54.399
Stay here with her.

1:27:57.141 --> 1:28:00.405
Eugene, we can still
get to Mexico.

1:28:00.579 --> 1:28:01.928
Don'’t you want
to find your father?

1:28:02.102 --> 1:28:05.062
He'’s gone, Allison!
He'’s dead.

1:28:06.585 --> 1:28:08.544
I ain'’t gonna find nobody!

1:28:26.431 --> 1:28:28.433
This is goodbye.

1:28:41.664 --> 1:28:43.056
Don'’t shoot me.

1:28:58.420 --> 1:29:00.596
Phoebe,
get in the car!

1:29:00.770 --> 1:29:02.119
Go.

1:29:08.081 --> 1:29:10.867
If you want the bounty,
you can take me in and get it.

1:29:13.348 --> 1:29:15.175
Or we can stick to the plan.

1:29:15.350 --> 1:29:17.656
I said, get in the car.

1:29:18.440 --> 1:29:19.789
But Eugene'’s out there.

1:29:19.963 --> 1:29:22.792
I won'’t let nothing happen
to him. I promise.

1:29:22.966 --> 1:29:24.837
It'’s all right.
It'’s all right.

1:29:26.012 --> 1:29:27.100
Stay here.

1:29:32.976 --> 1:29:34.891
Either way,
I'’m leaving it up to you.

1:29:46.250 --> 1:29:48.252
I'’ll tell them
I made you do everything.

1:29:50.341 --> 1:29:52.387
You can go on with your life.

1:29:58.697 --> 1:30:00.699
You got to pick
your burden, kid.

1:30:09.012 --> 1:30:10.492
Hey.

1:30:12.232 --> 1:30:14.191
I never wanted to lie to you.

1:30:15.714 --> 1:30:18.413
I told you all the truths
I knew how to.

1:30:19.718 --> 1:30:21.851
And I am
who you thought I was.

1:30:24.984 --> 1:30:26.812
It'’s a little more
complicated is all.

1:30:34.037 --> 1:30:35.430
I'’m scared, Allison.

1:30:37.519 --> 1:30:38.868
Yeah, me too.

1:30:40.478 --> 1:30:43.046
I'’d rather be scared
with you than alone.

1:30:46.179 --> 1:30:47.224
Please.

1:30:48.965 --> 1:30:51.489
We can baptize ourselves
in the ocean.

1:31:04.633 --> 1:31:05.634
Let'’s go.

1:31:16.383 --> 1:31:17.472
Get out of the way!

1:31:18.385 --> 1:31:19.430
We can make it.

1:31:23.521 --> 1:31:25.175
Run, Eugene!

1:31:39.798 --> 1:31:40.886
No!

1:31:42.105 --> 1:31:43.367
No! Allison!

1:31:49.591 --> 1:31:50.548
Allison.

1:31:52.115 --> 1:31:55.727
Oh, my God. No.

1:31:58.469 --> 1:32:00.689
It'’s over, son.
Put your guns down.

1:32:08.784 --> 1:32:09.828
Put '’em down!

1:32:13.745 --> 1:32:15.007
It'’s all right, son.

1:32:28.064 --> 1:32:29.369
Put your guns down!

1:32:30.327 --> 1:32:31.154
Put it down!

1:32:31.328 --> 1:32:34.331
I said put the gun down!

1:32:35.985 --> 1:32:37.508
On the ground!

1:32:37.682 --> 1:32:39.162
Run, Eugene!

1:32:52.001 --> 1:32:55.004
That was the last time
any of us saw Eugene.

1:32:55.178 --> 1:32:58.660
We don'’t know where he went or if he got there...

1:32:59.661 --> 1:33:01.358
but I never tried
to find him.

1:33:02.185 --> 1:33:04.622
That was never my destiny.

1:33:04.796 --> 1:33:07.669
Different fathers,
I suppose.

1:33:07.843 --> 1:33:12.674
But I do what I can
to keep the legend
of Eugene Baker alive.

1:33:12.848 --> 1:33:15.198
And with the tools
left for me,

1:33:15.372 --> 1:33:18.505
that true and honest absence that John left him

1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:20.159
and he gave to me,

1:33:21.073 --> 1:33:22.684
I tell his story.

1:33:25.687 --> 1:33:28.951
The last time
I saw my brother
was 20 years ago

1:33:29.125 --> 1:33:32.128
on April 16th, 1935...

1:33:46.229 --> 1:33:48.492
The first day it rained
in almost a year.

1:33:55.107 --> 1:33:58.633
Maybe a sign
that Eugene found what
he was looking for.

1:37:21.400 --> 1:37:26.362
Glove your hand?
