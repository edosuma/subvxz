WEBVTT

00:05.672 --> 00:07.716
NUMBER TWO:
Kate and Constance, they're struggling.

00:07.799 --> 00:10.176
Which is why we cannot let them fail.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.262
Does Benedict actually want us to cheat?

00:12.345 --> 00:14.681
Cheating comes with the territory
in the spy game.

00:14.764 --> 00:17.100
If we get caught, our brains get erased.

00:17.183 --> 00:21.062
But if we don't cheat, Kate and Constance
get barged and their brains get erased.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.356
REYNIE:
For you two, I'm thinking Morse code.

00:24.065 --> 00:26.484
Sticky Washington. Drop the pencil.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.319
You weren't fidgeting.
I know it was Morse code.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.905
CURTAIN:
Who were you working with, Sticky? Who?

00:30.989 --> 00:35.201
I need to get my eyes on that inlet
from somewhere up high.

00:35.285 --> 00:36.494
BENEDICT: We just might see some clue

00:36.578 --> 00:38.246
to what my brother is building
in the water.

00:38.329 --> 00:40.415
But this passageway I've discovered...

00:40.498 --> 00:42.083
We must send them in.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.962
REYNIE: Kate, I don't know what to say.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.799
-You're up.
-Just serve.

00:52.385 --> 00:53.803
There's potential.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.513
I'm actually being barged right now.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.223
Becky, get her sizes.

00:57.307 --> 00:59.309
-What?
-You're joining my team.

00:59.392 --> 01:02.937
Please join me in celebrating
our newest Messengers,

01:03.021 --> 01:06.357
Reynie Muldoon and Sticky Washington.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.250
How would you boys feel
about a cuffless hem

01:24.334 --> 01:25.877
with a half break at the ankle?

01:27.962 --> 01:30.715
-Uh... We like it?
-Mm-hmm.

01:34.302 --> 01:36.387
I feel different.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.724
I know what you mean. Like...

01:40.934 --> 01:41.976
confident.

01:42.894 --> 01:44.896
-Important.
-CURTAIN: Very.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.648
Oh.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.651
Cuffless hem. Half break.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.029
You're dragging us
into the modern era, Alphonse.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.781
The winds of change are upon us, sir.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.283
Indeed. No one's immune.
You can hold the work.

01:59.661 --> 02:00.620
Look at you.

02:01.746 --> 02:05.458
Never underestimate the effects
of a well-tailored outfit, gentlemen.

02:06.209 --> 02:10.130
It improves your mood,
your productivity, your creativity.

02:11.005 --> 02:12.257
Do you feel your power?

02:13.842 --> 02:16.719
It's really nice.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.180
Brilliant. What about you, Sticky?

02:22.642 --> 02:25.478
I'm sensing some hesitation.

02:28.064 --> 02:30.024
Can you not allow yourself luxury?

02:32.694 --> 02:33.736
I understand.

02:35.655 --> 02:39.200
You're thinking
that you don't deserve this, yes?

02:41.161 --> 02:45.957
Well, what you don't realize
is that the real test happened

02:46.040 --> 02:48.126
after the test you tried to cheat on.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.588
Your loyalty under pressure
was as impressive

02:51.671 --> 02:53.882
as your encyclopedic knowledge.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.009
More so, even.

02:59.470 --> 03:03.183
And that kind of loyalty is what we prize.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.269
You have earned this, Sticky.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.230
You both have.

03:10.523 --> 03:13.693
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Dr. Curtain.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.113
You know what's remarkable to me?

03:18.698 --> 03:22.327
Is the fact that you two arrived
on the very same day,

03:22.410 --> 03:24.454
in the very same vehicle.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.248
Is that just a coincidence?

03:30.126 --> 03:31.211
Excuse me?

03:32.045 --> 03:34.464
Or was it written in the stars?

03:35.048 --> 03:39.135
Uh, definitely the first one. Coincidence.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.511
Totally random.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.096
Hmm.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.228
Strange.

03:50.021 --> 03:52.273
Well, regardless of what
the word around campus is,

03:52.357 --> 03:54.192
I don't think either of you is a mistake.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.113
Now, what I'm sure
you've been waiting for...

04:01.532 --> 04:02.617
Please hold this.

04:05.286 --> 04:06.579
With this sash

04:07.747 --> 04:10.375
comes all the responsibilities...

04:16.923 --> 04:20.927
and all the privileges of a Messenger.

04:25.598 --> 04:26.891
Look at yourselves.

04:34.148 --> 04:36.109
Wear them with pride, gentlemen.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.153
Wear them with pride.

05:43.968 --> 05:44.927
What?

05:45.970 --> 05:47.096
Just thinking.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.975
The sashes could be strung together
if we ever need a...

05:52.310 --> 05:53.978
sash rope.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.689
You can joke, but this was the goal.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.610
Being a Messenger gets us access
and information.

06:01.444 --> 06:04.822
I think George Washington
likes his new outfit.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.910
There's no words.
It just feels so buttery.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.413
What about last night's message?

06:12.497 --> 06:15.166
-Did you two get it?
-Absolutely.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.674
So many dots and dashes.

06:24.384 --> 06:30.681
"Between the copper waves
and the bells, using news,

06:30.765 --> 06:34.644
move the bane of the King of Corinth..."

06:34.894 --> 06:38.815
-Why can't he just tell us?
-He's being cautious.

06:38.898 --> 06:42.235
If he's obscuring it this much,
then it must be important.

06:42.318 --> 06:44.612
Or he likes the sound of his own voice.

06:44.695 --> 06:49.575
Sounds like directions. So, copper waves.

06:50.201 --> 06:53.246
We need to find someone
with red, curly hair.

06:53.329 --> 06:54.580
No one here has red hair.

06:55.581 --> 06:58.709
Jonah Burns has strawberry blond hair,
but it's straight.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.880
I'm not gonna apologize
for knowing things.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.633
It's the sculpture. The ugly one.

07:05.716 --> 07:07.343
On the north campus.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.430
-That's green.
-Oxidized copper.

07:10.513 --> 07:11.806
Nice, Constance.

07:11.889 --> 07:15.726
You should lean on me more.
These guys are dead weight.

07:17.228 --> 07:20.356
Okay. No idea what "bells" means.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.859
But, "Move the bane
of the King of Corinth"?

07:22.942 --> 07:27.488
That's Greek mythology.
The King of Corinth was Sisyphus.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.409
He got punished by the gods

07:31.492 --> 07:36.414
and was forced to push a boulder
up a hill over and over, for eternity.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.000
He should not have angered the gods.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.127
So, we're looking for a boulder?

07:41.752 --> 07:44.046
But what about the bells and the news?

07:44.130 --> 07:46.132
MARTINA: Muldoon! Washington!

07:49.510 --> 07:52.513
Looks like the queen
is requesting your presence.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.015
Should we go?

07:55.600 --> 07:57.685
We should go, right? For the mission.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.729
Play the role.

08:10.072 --> 08:11.782
-Hi.
-Hello.

08:11.866 --> 08:15.161
You're Messengers now.
You eat at the Messenger table.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.498
-Cool.
-We didn't know.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.416
Just one of the perks.

08:26.422 --> 08:28.424
Nice legroom. Really comfortable.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.135
So, what's your secret?

08:34.597 --> 08:37.141
We don't have any secrets.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.018
Secrets cause stress,

08:39.101 --> 08:41.812
and stress leads
to all sorts of illnesses.

08:41.896 --> 08:46.359
Ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux,
temporomandibular disorder...

08:47.735 --> 08:53.699
Okay. No one has ever gotten
their sash this fast. No one.

08:54.992 --> 08:59.372
So, what was it? Connected parents?
A wealthy guardian?

09:00.414 --> 09:02.959
We just did well in school.

09:04.585 --> 09:09.799
So, this Messenger duty,
what exactly does it entail?

09:12.552 --> 09:17.223
-You just have to experience it.
-It's incredibly rewarding.

09:18.182 --> 09:19.308
Unless it breaks you.

09:19.976 --> 09:20.893
Why would it...

09:20.977 --> 09:25.398
Messengers, anyone see a blinking light
across the channel last night?

09:25.481 --> 09:27.400
Approximately 2100 hours.

09:27.900 --> 09:28.943
-No.
-Not me.

09:29.026 --> 09:30.486
JILLSON: It looked like some kind of code.

09:33.864 --> 09:36.284
Oh, yeah, I saw that.

09:36.367 --> 09:39.704
Probably just the Coast Guard
signaling a boat.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.455
Why would they do that?

09:41.539 --> 09:45.001
You know, to guide it through the fog.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.587
It was so foggy last night.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.005
-No, it wasn't.
-Perfectly clear.

09:49.088 --> 09:51.215
You guys must have been
at a higher elevation,

09:51.299 --> 09:53.259
where condensation levels taper off.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.762
We're gonna stand watch
the next few nights to be safe.

09:56.846 --> 09:57.763
Weapons hot.

09:58.055 --> 10:00.349
-You have weapons?
-It's an expression, rook.

10:00.433 --> 10:05.271
Just stay alert.
Anyone sees these lights, report to us.

10:36.844 --> 10:39.055
BENEDICT:
The Morse code has been compromised.

10:39.138 --> 10:42.224
But, thankfully,
not before they could warn us.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.227
I've sent notifications to everyone
on Curtain's list,

10:45.311 --> 10:46.896
present company excluded.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.231
Having trouble tracking down, uh,

10:49.982 --> 10:54.945
Hildegard Billingsley and Arthur Bloom.
But I'll stay on it.

10:55.404 --> 10:56.989
Thank you.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.868
Now, we need a new way
to communicate with the children.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.745
-Handled.
-Really?

11:02.828 --> 11:05.414
-I've acquired a falcon.
-A falcon?

11:06.290 --> 11:11.170
The new method of communication.
It's tethered, humanely, just outside.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.923
I thought we discussed semaphore.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.967
A peregrine falcon,
the fastest animal on Earth.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.094
When diving.

11:19.804 --> 11:22.223
Semaphore required too many flags.

11:22.556 --> 11:25.393
Are falcons known as messenger birds?

11:25.476 --> 11:27.144
Hmm.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.063
Which would you rather have?

11:29.146 --> 11:33.192
A common, even stupid, pigeon
or the fastest animal on Earth?

11:35.027 --> 11:37.613
So, yes?

11:39.198 --> 11:43.494
Yes. I believe what Rhonda
is rightfully asking...

11:43.577 --> 11:48.833
I... I... Is this bird trained in the art
of conveyance and round-trippery?

11:48.916 --> 11:50.626
-Highly trainable creatures.
-Oh.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.211
Fastest animal.

11:52.628 --> 11:54.255
BENEDICT: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

11:55.297 --> 11:58.426
We don't exactly have
a surfeit of options, so...

12:00.636 --> 12:02.012
Where did you find this bird?

12:03.097 --> 12:04.306
Uh...

12:05.641 --> 12:07.101
They're quite regal.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.272
Number Two, bring in the bird.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.982
They are outside creatures.

12:14.024 --> 12:14.984
Ah.

12:29.665 --> 12:31.876
CURTAIN: Found it.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.339
Are you sure?

12:38.466 --> 12:39.592
That's the one.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.221
I'll check on availability.

12:47.224 --> 12:52.396
I never liked Morse code anyway.
Inefficient. Clicky.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.315
It's a beautiful system.

12:54.398 --> 12:56.442
STICKY: Maybe you should've
tried harder to learn it.

12:56.525 --> 12:58.110
Maybe I just had a bad tutor.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.236
Come on, guys.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.405
We need to focus on the mission
in front of us.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.575
We need to find that boulder, get past it,

13:04.950 --> 13:06.994
-and...
-And what? What happens after that?

13:07.453 --> 13:11.123
Wildcat. Go on instinct. Storm the tower.

13:11.916 --> 13:16.003
-Await further instructions.
-But there are no further instructions.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.838
Then we just have to figure it out.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.341
We're all smart and capable...

13:20.424 --> 13:22.760
Don't you get it? We're flying blind now!

13:22.843 --> 13:26.138
Right into a storm!
A violent, turbulent storm

13:26.222 --> 13:29.683
-with hale and sleet and...
-Sticky.

13:31.435 --> 13:32.812
Cleansing breaths.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.232
Do it.

13:42.738 --> 13:46.617
-Reynie Muldoon. Sticky Washington.
-Messenger duty.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.468
REYNIE: Where exactly are we going?

14:04.552 --> 14:06.178
JACKSON: You'll find out
when you're there.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.598
JILLSON: Stop here.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.350
Put these on.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.602
Mandatory eyewear.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.814
But I already have eyewear.

14:16.897 --> 14:20.526
You're welcome to use your own eyewear
as long as you put those on over them.

14:25.072 --> 14:26.156
Whoa.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.577
REYNIE: I can't see a thing.

14:30.578 --> 14:31.662
JACKSON: That's the point.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.469
Voilà! Copper waves!

14:49.221 --> 14:52.892
This is vomit of metal, not art.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.227
From here, we look for the bell.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.903
What? My bucket? What about it?

15:04.320 --> 15:05.654
I think you know.

15:09.658 --> 15:14.538
Look for the bell, Constance.
A bell-shaped tree, maybe?

15:14.622 --> 15:15.831
Wetherall!

15:19.001 --> 15:22.171
You're late. Practice started
20 minutes ago. Let's go.

15:22.254 --> 15:27.217
Uh, actually, Constance and I
need to finish a group project for...

15:28.218 --> 15:29.762
Spatial Relations class.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.722
Don't be dense.

15:32.306 --> 15:33.515
Excuse me?

15:33.599 --> 15:38.145
She is the reason you get to stay here.
So, tetherball or barge.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.189
Your choice.

15:45.611 --> 15:49.782
You're right. Priorities.
Tetherball, number one.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.660
That's what I like to hear.

15:53.786 --> 15:54.995
Lose the bucket.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.623
I'm not gonna do that.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.249
You don't have a choice.

15:59.541 --> 16:02.962
Someone powers a backhand
into that thing, shatters your hip,

16:03.045 --> 16:04.463
now, I'm down a player again.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.675
Bucket stays off my court.

16:08.175 --> 16:10.010
I have Velcro. I'll tie it down.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.721
-You'll never notice it's even...
-Lose the bucket.

16:15.265 --> 16:16.809
Just have your little friend hold it.

16:18.352 --> 16:23.607
Roommate, not friend.
But I will gladly take possession.

16:39.915 --> 16:42.543
STICKY: Messenger duty... is it painful?

16:42.960 --> 16:45.421
-Pain is subjective.
-Mostly in the mind.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.172
-

16:47.256 --> 16:48.882
Wha... what was that?

16:50.342 --> 16:52.136
An elevator, I think.

16:52.219 --> 16:54.972
JILLSON: Silence from this point on.
No more questions.

17:14.575 --> 17:15.576
BENEDICT: Hmm.

17:19.079 --> 17:22.750
Oh, appreciate the gesture
but falcons aren't olfactory hunters.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.293
It's a visual reference.

17:24.543 --> 17:27.087
-Well, then, let me take off the hood.
-Oh, no. Here we are.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.547
Oh, here we are.

17:29.548 --> 17:30.632
BENEDICT: There we are.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.052
I believe in you.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.303
Hmm.

17:34.553 --> 17:35.637
Bird...

17:41.393 --> 17:43.896
-Yes.

17:43.979 --> 17:45.397
BENEDICT: Oh...

17:48.734 --> 17:50.861
Oh, she is majestic.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.580
-

18:02.414 --> 18:03.457
Oh, no.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.423
She just needs to acclimate
to her new environment.

18:11.507 --> 18:15.677
No, falcons are birds of prey.
It's embedded in their DNA.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.513
Everyone has the power to change.

18:17.596 --> 18:21.809
Well, yes. Except this bird, I fear.
It's a killer in its heart.

18:23.393 --> 18:24.978
Oh, we need a new plan.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.815
Every moment we can't communicate
with the team

18:27.898 --> 18:29.316
is a moment they could be in danger.

18:31.819 --> 18:32.945
Was that...

18:33.821 --> 18:35.155
Someone's approaching.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.532
No one knows we're here.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.409
-Curtain has found us.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.711
Where is Reynie?

18:51.755 --> 18:52.798
Oh.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.341
Hello.

18:54.424 --> 18:55.509
Where is he?

18:56.093 --> 18:58.554
-If I may...
-Identification! Now!

18:58.637 --> 19:03.225
Uh... Stand down, Number Two.
This person is clearly not an assassin.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.351
My apologies.

19:04.434 --> 19:06.436
Is someone trying to assassinate you?

19:06.520 --> 19:08.897
Oh, no, no, no.
This is all simply a precaution,

19:08.981 --> 19:10.065
as is our seclusion.

19:10.816 --> 19:14.236
We believed that we were undetectable
until your arrival, Miss, um...

19:14.319 --> 19:15.529
Miss...

19:15.612 --> 19:19.158
Perumal. I'm Reynie Muldoon's teacher
from the Stonetown Orphanage.

19:19.575 --> 19:20.450
Oh.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.911
Oh...

19:23.120 --> 19:25.330
What an honor to meet you.

19:25.414 --> 19:28.959
Allow me to introduce us.
My name is Nicholas Benedict.

19:29.042 --> 19:32.504
These are my associates, Number Two,
Rhonda Kazembe, and Milligan.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.799
-Your name is Number Two?
-Yeah. So?

19:35.883 --> 19:36.842
Ah...

19:36.925 --> 19:39.386
If you don't mind me asking,
how did you find us here?

19:43.015 --> 19:46.226
The day of the exam, I received a call
from one of the test proctors

19:47.436 --> 19:49.813
who sounded remarkably like this woman.

19:50.814 --> 19:53.817
She told me that Reynie had been accepted
to the Boatwright Academy,

19:53.901 --> 19:55.277
effective immediately.

19:55.819 --> 19:59.615
Delighted, I sent Reynie a care package.
But the school returned it.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.284
MS. PERUMAL: I called them,
there seemed to be some confusion.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.912
So, I visited Boatwright in person
to clear the matter up.

20:05.537 --> 20:09.541
The staff there gave me the runaround.
They were very discreet, but I persisted

20:09.625 --> 20:13.503
until they admitted that Reynie Muldoon
is not a student there.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.130
I went straight to the Stonetown Gazette

20:15.214 --> 20:17.299
to find out who had placed
the original ad.

20:17.382 --> 20:20.010
They gave me a name. Cheri Turpintown.

20:20.594 --> 20:23.013
At the local registrar,
I learned that the name was an alias

20:23.096 --> 20:24.348
with no known address.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.517
Now, I happen to be a bit of a puzzler.

20:27.601 --> 20:33.523
So, I realized Cheri Turpintown
is an anagram for Power in Truth Inc.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.527
A shell corporation with only a PO Box,

20:38.195 --> 20:41.531
which I staked out
until this woman arrived

20:41.615 --> 20:45.160
and furtively picked up a package
of cedar planks.

20:46.286 --> 20:50.290
She eluded me, but my mind returned
to the cedar planks.

20:50.832 --> 20:53.877
Cedar planks? She's grilling salmon.

20:54.544 --> 20:57.047
When the fishmonger didn't recognize
the woman's description,

20:57.130 --> 21:00.092
that told me that she's fishing
for her own salmon.

21:00.175 --> 21:01.760
-Yes.
-PERUMAL: And the only place in Stonetown

21:01.843 --> 21:04.680
where you can fish without a license
is a two-mile stretch of shoreline

21:04.763 --> 21:06.014
in the Beauchamps Woods,

21:06.098 --> 21:09.184
which has a trailhead that leads
right here.

21:11.478 --> 21:13.897
You got lucky
with the licenseless fishing part.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.651
I believe that I've earned
the right to know.

21:18.694 --> 21:19.820
Where is Reynie?

21:20.696 --> 21:22.990
He's fine. Perfectly fine.

21:23.490 --> 21:26.868
He's in school,
just not the one you expected.

21:27.744 --> 21:33.083
Um, please, allow me to explain
over a nice, warm meal.

21:35.210 --> 21:37.713
How do you feel about cedar plank salmon?

21:39.256 --> 21:40.465
MARTINA: A downswing hammerhead

21:40.549 --> 21:43.468
will always play north-south
on the come-around.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.470
It's a harder ball to return.

21:45.971 --> 21:49.641
I am seeing way too many
Dutch Laterals out there.

21:49.891 --> 21:52.894
Dutch Laterals are two-dimensional
and purely velo-based.

21:53.437 --> 21:57.607
So, sure, if you're 6'5" then maybe
you can just burn it and turn it.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.151
Wetherall!

21:59.860 --> 22:01.611
Lock it up. Eyes here.

22:03.655 --> 22:06.450
Otherwise, it is a loser.

22:07.784 --> 22:09.536
What kind of ball do we want to play?

22:10.454 --> 22:14.333
-Three-dimensional?
-MARTINA: Multi-dimensional.

22:15.542 --> 22:19.588
Incorporate the Helix. Live in the Helix.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.549
Complexity of attack is our signature.

22:22.632 --> 22:25.260
It's how we play the game. It's our edge.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.347
Right now, I'm only seeing
one of you scrubs

22:28.430 --> 22:30.098
doing that on a consistent basis.

22:30.474 --> 22:33.643
Kate, come up here and show them
proper hammerhead form.

22:37.522 --> 22:42.694
See? Elbow away from the body,
slight pronation, hit and flick.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.533
MARTINA: Look at that Helix. Unreturnable.

22:49.576 --> 22:51.828
Wetherall has way less experience
than you do

22:51.912 --> 22:54.206
and no formal training before now.

22:54.289 --> 22:57.709
What you are seeing
is instinct, feeling...

22:59.711 --> 23:01.296
Nice work, Wetherall.

23:17.979 --> 23:21.400
Reynard. Sticky. Welcome.

23:22.442 --> 23:23.777
Thank you, Jackson and Jillson.

23:26.154 --> 23:31.576
You'll get used to the goggles.
It's a necessary inconvenience

23:31.660 --> 23:34.913
since this gallery contains
my most prized invention...

23:35.747 --> 23:36.873
The Whisperer.

23:40.627 --> 23:41.670
Where is it?

23:42.546 --> 23:44.381
Oh, it's everywhere. It's all around you.

23:45.173 --> 23:47.092
These chairs are only part of the device.

23:50.178 --> 23:52.556
Does it affect your memory?

23:53.140 --> 23:54.641
No.

23:55.725 --> 23:58.895
The Whisperer is a finely calibrated,

23:58.979 --> 24:03.650
collaborative learning tool
designed to open the mind.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.361
Open the mind how?

24:07.362 --> 24:10.073
Why don't you leave
the how and the why to me,

24:10.157 --> 24:13.493
and you concentrate
on the where and the when?

24:13.910 --> 24:14.953
Here...

24:16.121 --> 24:17.205
now.

24:18.039 --> 24:22.752
Come, see for yourself.
Reynard, why don't you go first?

24:34.806 --> 24:37.017
Go on. It won't bite.

24:40.395 --> 24:43.440
Just savoring the moment, sir.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.125
What do I do now?

25:03.210 --> 25:04.544
Just listen and speak.

25:34.783 --> 25:35.951
Off we go.

25:58.473 --> 26:00.141
CONSTANCE: It's beautiful.

26:23.832 --> 26:28.169
you can find

27:11.796 --> 27:15.300
and it filled me with wonder

27:18.887 --> 27:23.516
that you'll understand"

27:42.369 --> 27:43.703
WHISPERER: What is your name?

27:45.955 --> 27:48.708
I'm sorry. What is your name?

27:51.044 --> 27:52.253
Reynie Muldoon.

27:53.254 --> 27:54.422
Hello, Reynie.

27:55.256 --> 27:58.176
I think we should begin. Don't you?

27:59.719 --> 28:01.429
Um... Sure.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.557
What is your favorite color?

28:07.060 --> 28:08.103
Blue?

28:09.187 --> 28:13.983
Sky blue? Ocean blue? Coral blue?

28:15.360 --> 28:16.569
Ocean blue.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.447
It's a beauty.

28:21.032 --> 28:23.159
What do you consider the loveliest season?

28:25.537 --> 28:27.455
Autumn, I suppose.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.916
Hmm. When the leaves start to change

28:29.999 --> 28:32.836
and a light jacket is all you need
in the late afternoon.

28:34.462 --> 28:36.256
What was the last book you read?

28:37.757 --> 28:38.883
Bleak House.

28:40.176 --> 28:43.847
Was it a good read? Was it enjoyable?

28:45.348 --> 28:47.976
You know what? It was.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.019
A connoisseur.

28:51.604 --> 28:52.772
Not really.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.569
What is your strongest subject
in school, Reynie?

28:58.653 --> 29:02.782
English, but I like learning
foreign languages too.

29:03.658 --> 29:05.034
I'm learning Tamil.

29:06.661 --> 29:08.288
I was, anyway.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.749
Speaking multiple languages

29:10.832 --> 29:13.626
is the most reliable indicator
of intelligence.

29:15.712 --> 29:19.799
Thank you, um, Whisperer.

29:21.217 --> 29:23.595
Reynie, what do you fear the most?

29:27.724 --> 29:29.726
Spiders scare me a little.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.479
Oh, they're just terrible.

29:33.062 --> 29:35.523
But what do you fear the most?

29:41.696 --> 29:42.989
Being alone.

29:44.491 --> 29:45.742
Thank you for that.

29:47.368 --> 29:51.289
Don't worry, Reynie.
You are not alone anymore.

30:03.343 --> 30:04.886
NUMBER TWO: The amuse-bouche,

30:04.969 --> 30:09.057
sesame-seared bay scallops
served with a yuzu gastrique.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.143
-Yes, thank you.
-MS. PERUMAL: Thanks.

30:13.102 --> 30:15.104
So, you see, Ms. Perumal,

30:15.188 --> 30:17.524
if Reynie and his companions
do not succeed,

30:17.607 --> 30:20.193
this so-called Emergency
will not only continue...

30:20.276 --> 30:22.028
Local greens.

30:22.111 --> 30:24.864
Very local.
From right over there, in fact.

30:30.370 --> 30:32.956
It will not only continue,
but get much worse.

30:33.039 --> 30:35.166
Anxiety, depression, despair...

30:35.250 --> 30:37.085
-Where's your proof?
-

30:37.168 --> 30:38.920
-As I said, I have recordings...
-Yes, I know.

30:39.003 --> 30:42.549
Meaningless phrases.
Not a shred of hard evidence.

30:42.632 --> 30:45.718
The man behind this
is a master manipulator.

30:45.802 --> 30:49.472
He is very real and very capable
of achieving his own goals.

30:49.806 --> 30:52.100
He is fixated, egomaniacal,

30:52.183 --> 30:54.477
and extremely effective
in covering his own tracks.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.148
-And he's also my brother.
-Your brother?

30:59.691 --> 31:05.238
Black barley risotto
finished with a wheatgrass vinaigrette.

31:07.782 --> 31:09.450
The courses are coming rather quickly.

31:09.534 --> 31:12.954
This whole meal progression is vital
to the experience of the palate.

31:15.415 --> 31:18.751
I realize this might
take some time to digest.

31:37.061 --> 31:40.356
You said you'd watch my bucket.
You ditched it.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.733
Left it there in the open.

31:41.816 --> 31:44.569
This is more important than stupid bucket.

31:44.652 --> 31:47.405
The bucket isn't stupid. It's vital.

31:47.488 --> 31:49.949
Your bucket is not just a bucket.

31:50.033 --> 31:52.619
I'm pretty sure it's a bucket.

31:52.702 --> 31:53.786
It's a crutch.

31:53.870 --> 31:56.456
If you call preparedness a crutch,
then I can't help you.

31:56.831 --> 31:58.541
Preparedness is illusion of control.

31:58.625 --> 32:01.377
What you did was a major breach of trust.

32:01.461 --> 32:04.005
You know what I don't like?
People who don't do what they say.

32:04.088 --> 32:07.342
No excuses.
Do what you say you're going to do!

32:07.842 --> 32:09.761
Had idea. Had to act.

32:10.386 --> 32:13.640
See? Stonetown bell tower.

32:20.063 --> 32:23.149
"Between the copper waves
and the bells..."

32:25.568 --> 32:26.986
So, that means...

32:29.113 --> 32:31.699
this boulder is the bane
of the King of Corinth!

32:32.408 --> 32:34.869
Yes. But look.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.670
There's got to be some trick to it.

32:44.545 --> 32:46.589
Benedict said to use news.

32:47.674 --> 32:50.551
I put my foot on the stone, said "news",

32:50.843 --> 32:53.930
tapped "news" in Morse code. Nothing.

32:56.724 --> 32:58.559
Maybe try news headlines?

33:01.229 --> 33:03.314
"Emergency!" "Doom!"

33:03.398 --> 33:04.774
"No one at the wheel!"

33:14.409 --> 33:15.660
News...

33:17.078 --> 33:18.162
News?

33:21.582 --> 33:24.335
KATE: North, east,

33:25.586 --> 33:26.671
west...

33:28.423 --> 33:29.590
south.

33:36.472 --> 33:40.309
So, there's a second element.
Get on my back.

33:41.310 --> 33:44.313
No, I will not be doing that.

33:44.397 --> 33:46.441
Hop on.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.951
KATE: Look at that. Weight sensitive.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.143
WHISPERER:
What was the last book you read?

34:24.187 --> 34:27.356
The Encyclopedia, volume J.

34:28.483 --> 34:31.402
You love to learn, don't you?

34:31.819 --> 34:32.820
I do.

34:33.571 --> 34:35.948
There's something comforting
about knowing things.

34:36.532 --> 34:38.076
It feels good to know.

34:39.494 --> 34:42.663
Yes. Actually, it does.

34:43.873 --> 34:46.584
What is your strongest subject
in school, Sticky?

34:48.961 --> 34:50.463
Can I pick more than one?

34:51.380 --> 34:52.924
Love it. Go.

34:54.133 --> 34:58.387
Science, history, math, Italian...

34:59.430 --> 35:02.058
I like your style. More is more.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.395
What do you fear the most?

35:09.649 --> 35:11.859
It's okay. Take your time.

35:13.277 --> 35:14.821
What do you fear the most?

35:17.782 --> 35:19.408
Not being understood.

35:19.909 --> 35:21.035
Hmm.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.871
I can't help but think... there's more?

35:28.626 --> 35:30.002
STICKY: Not being wanted.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.175
Not being wanted at all.

35:38.427 --> 35:39.637
Thank you for that.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.223
You are wanted.

35:43.057 --> 35:44.475
You are home.

35:47.353 --> 35:48.604
Shall we begin?

35:50.273 --> 35:51.566
Repeat after me.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.801
-Voices.
-Where?

36:22.138 --> 36:23.806
The voices in your head?

36:24.182 --> 36:27.560
Yeah, but now I can hear what it's saying.

36:28.311 --> 36:33.691
I'm sure that's distracting,
but right now, I need you to deal and...

36:33.774 --> 36:35.985
I can hear George Washington.

36:36.819 --> 36:39.947
Wait, now you hear Sticky? Specifically?

36:41.866 --> 36:42.909
Yeah.

36:43.451 --> 36:46.204
He's whispering nonsense into my head.

36:46.954 --> 36:50.499
What? What kind of nonsense?

36:51.876 --> 36:53.169
Just words.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.005
Strange words.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.345
One of Curtain's subliminal messages.

37:02.970 --> 37:03.971
Constance!

37:04.639 --> 37:07.934
Sticky just went to Messenger duty.
That's what it is.

37:08.601 --> 37:10.811
The voices you've been hearing,
they're Messengers!

37:11.312 --> 37:13.814
And your tiny brain
can somehow pick it up!

37:14.315 --> 37:16.359
I knew you had to be special in some way.

37:16.859 --> 37:18.527
Many, many ways.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.697
What's he saying now?

37:27.620 --> 37:30.873
"The missing aren't missing..."

37:32.208 --> 37:34.543
They're only departed.

37:38.381 --> 37:42.677
And I have to return to the fact
that we are talking about your brother.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.637
That's a recent revelation, so...

37:44.720 --> 37:46.097
-I don't need the story.
-Mm-hmm.

37:46.722 --> 37:49.684
This is all such a blatant disregard

37:49.767 --> 37:51.644
for the safety of Reynie
and his companions.

37:51.727 --> 37:54.397
-Please...
-Cedar plank coho salmon

37:54.480 --> 37:58.401
with hazelnuts and celeriac dauphinoise.

38:02.238 --> 38:04.573
-This is a tremendous amount of food.
-True.

38:05.741 --> 38:06.784
Please hear me.

38:06.867 --> 38:10.288
It is my mission to preserve hope
for a greater future.

38:10.371 --> 38:12.915
And not just for Reynie,
but for every child.

38:12.999 --> 38:14.917
Sending the children was a last resort.

38:15.001 --> 38:17.878
If there was any other way,
I'd have taken it at any cost.

38:17.962 --> 38:20.881
If I could go in his place,
I would but none of us can.

38:21.382 --> 38:22.758
As unfair as it sounds,

38:22.842 --> 38:27.179
it is the children...
it is the children who have to save us.

38:31.976 --> 38:33.894
Narcolepsy.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.521
No cause for concern.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.692
Please, eat your food.

39:13.559 --> 39:14.685
Mmm.

39:15.770 --> 39:17.605
The cedar wood really does add something.

39:17.813 --> 39:18.814
Hmm.

39:18.898 --> 39:21.108
I'll be sure to pass on the compliment.

39:21.400 --> 39:22.485
I'm back.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.570
I'm back.

39:29.450 --> 39:34.455
I apologize for my volume earlier.

39:35.581 --> 39:37.416
But I'm very protective of Reynie.

39:38.959 --> 39:40.378
And I wanted the best for him.

39:41.253 --> 39:44.590
Yes. And please know that my intentions
are the same as yours in the end.

39:46.133 --> 39:48.094
-I'd like to speak to him.
-

39:49.095 --> 39:53.099
Yes. That might not be possible.

39:53.182 --> 39:56.018
It seems our method of communication
has been compromised,

39:56.102 --> 39:59.480
and we're not exactly sure
when they'll report back next.

39:59.563 --> 40:01.732
However, I'm sure they'll make contact
after their search

40:01.816 --> 40:03.567
of the underground tunnel
I sent them into.

40:05.611 --> 40:06.946
You sent them where?

41:08.382 --> 41:09.884
Hildegard Billingsley.

41:11.427 --> 41:17.433
-No, doesn't ring a bell.
-Wonderful. Elk Grove Avenue?

41:17.808 --> 41:19.143
Never been there.

41:20.728 --> 41:22.104
You'll feel much better now.

41:25.107 --> 41:27.526
This is the brain sweeper.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.362
At least it looks like it doesn't hurt.

41:32.823 --> 41:33.866
I hear something.

41:33.949 --> 41:35.034
More voices?

41:36.327 --> 41:37.620
Footsteps.

41:53.677 --> 41:58.098
I need to remind you it isn't safe
to interrupt a degaussing session.

41:58.182 --> 42:01.185
Which is why I did it reluctantly.
It's perfectly safe for you and me.

42:01.268 --> 42:02.311
Not for the patient.

42:02.394 --> 42:04.980
DR. GARRISON: It can have lasting
side effects, devastating ones, which...

42:05.064 --> 42:07.274
CURTAIN: I'm confident you'll work it out.
Hm?

42:12.029 --> 42:14.031
These testing protocols
are just wasting time.

42:16.909 --> 42:18.327
The Improvement is here.

42:24.750 --> 42:27.002
Fast track all of it. Right away.

42:30.339 --> 42:32.883
We must have been
in the Whisperer for hours.

42:33.842 --> 42:35.719
It only felt like a few minutes.

42:36.220 --> 42:37.429
I know.

42:39.098 --> 42:40.140
Did you...

42:41.892 --> 42:45.563
-Did I what?
-Did you enjoy it?

42:46.522 --> 42:48.482
It wasn't what I expected.

42:50.359 --> 42:51.777
Terrible, right?

42:53.195 --> 42:55.781
Yeah, bad. It wasn't great.

42:55.864 --> 42:56.907
Not at all.

42:56.991 --> 43:00.828
If I never had to do it again,
I'd, you know, be happy.

43:00.911 --> 43:03.539
Good, because we shouldn't do it again.

43:04.665 --> 43:05.749
Why?

43:06.875 --> 43:09.461
It's the Transmitter, Sticky.

43:09.545 --> 43:13.048
You and I personally just sent
subliminal messages into the world.

43:13.757 --> 43:16.218
We helped create the Emergency today.

43:17.928 --> 43:19.179
I guess you're right.

43:19.847 --> 43:21.932
I didn't think it would control us too.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.352
REYNIE: Curtain designed the Whisperer
to make us feel loyal,

43:25.436 --> 43:26.812
even dependent on him.

43:27.187 --> 43:29.898
We have to remember that he's the enemy.

43:30.524 --> 43:32.151
But then, how will we beat it?

43:32.651 --> 43:34.862
We spent all this time
trying to get inside.

43:34.945 --> 43:40.242
That's our plan. Now, we're there.
And I don't think we can just refuse.

43:44.538 --> 43:47.291
DR. GARRISON:
Your enthusiasm is always inspiring.

43:47.374 --> 43:49.376
Oh, it's my role to inspire.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.503
But you can't rush the science.

43:51.587 --> 43:56.258
Oh, no, I can. Too much caution
isn't a virtue, it's tedious.

43:58.010 --> 43:59.720
DR. GARRISON:
I don't see myself as tedious.

43:59.803 --> 44:03.724
Oh, no, no, no. You're spectacular.

44:04.183 --> 44:05.768
But this constant testing,

44:06.185 --> 44:08.520
it's meaningless
if we let the goal slip away.

44:08.604 --> 44:11.315
I am simply doing the job
that you hired me to do

44:11.398 --> 44:14.401
as safely and humanely as possible.

44:14.485 --> 44:15.486
Oh.

44:19.198 --> 44:21.492
Nothing is more humane
than what we're doing.

44:22.451 --> 44:23.535
Yes?

44:23.619 --> 44:25.329
I'm only responsible for my part.

44:25.829 --> 44:28.165
The technology, not the philosophy.

44:29.041 --> 44:30.125
How's the farm?

44:30.793 --> 44:34.380
Operational. Still a few pesky bugs
that need to be worked out, but...

44:34.463 --> 44:37.257
Both farm and forest need to be ready
tomorrow for a trial run.

44:39.009 --> 44:41.512
DR. GARRISON:
I have registered your request.

44:41.595 --> 44:44.348
And while I must formally lodge
a complaint...

44:44.431 --> 44:48.102
I'm sorry.
Are you making a legal disclaimer?

44:55.734 --> 44:56.944
Who are you talking to?

44:58.404 --> 45:00.572
While I must formally protest...

45:00.823 --> 45:04.910
Hey. A simple "yes" will suffice.

45:09.415 --> 45:10.457
Yes.

45:13.043 --> 45:15.379
The Emergency has served its purpose.

45:16.046 --> 45:17.297
The people are ready.

45:18.424 --> 45:21.677
CURTAIN: Soon, they'll have relief
from endless choices,

45:21.760 --> 45:24.388
endless voices, chaos.

45:24.847 --> 45:26.849
That's all I want for them.

45:29.226 --> 45:30.936
Tell that to your invisible lawyer.

45:33.480 --> 45:34.773
Unity.

45:35.774 --> 45:39.236
One thought, one purpose.

45:42.614 --> 45:43.907
Oh...

45:45.200 --> 45:47.244
Have I told you how much I appreciate you?

45:51.707 --> 45:55.002
This, it can't wait another day.

46:00.299 --> 46:02.968
No, no, no. Please,
please trust me, Ms. Perumal.

46:03.051 --> 46:04.052
Trust you?

46:04.720 --> 46:06.346
What have you done to earn anyone's trust?

46:06.430 --> 46:08.098
-Oh.
-Where's my...

46:10.392 --> 46:11.643
Thank you, Milligan.

46:12.686 --> 46:15.606
I won't allow you
to endanger these children any longer.

46:15.689 --> 46:17.441
I'll be reporting you to the Department...

46:18.400 --> 46:21.570
I'll be reporting you
to the Department of Juvenile Well-Being.

46:21.653 --> 46:22.654
Please do.

46:22.738 --> 46:24.364
I'd love to find any institution

46:24.448 --> 46:26.492
that cares about the well-being
of children anymore.

46:27.242 --> 46:28.410
You have to understand,

46:28.494 --> 46:31.705
my brother has influenced
all levels of government.

46:31.789 --> 46:33.290
Anything that hampers him,

46:33.373 --> 46:36.502
you will find has been dismantled
or left to wither.

46:37.795 --> 46:39.087
Goodbye, Mr. Benedict.

46:42.257 --> 46:44.384
-What is this?
-Profiteroles.

46:45.385 --> 46:46.512
Thank you.

46:48.055 --> 46:49.264
It's a gracious touch.

46:58.482 --> 47:01.276
What if she's right?
This mission started out dangerous,

47:01.360 --> 47:04.238
and now, without a reliable means
of communication...

47:04.321 --> 47:05.614
We still have the falcon.

47:07.366 --> 47:09.576
Well, she poses her own
set of dangers, doesn't she?

47:16.875 --> 47:19.086
We'll exfiltrate the children
at first light.

47:19.378 --> 47:20.420
What?

47:22.172 --> 47:27.344
So, you're just going to let
a random person just walk in here

47:27.427 --> 47:28.720
and end the mission?

47:29.972 --> 47:31.014
Yes.

47:32.224 --> 47:35.352
Sometimes, it takes an outsider
to let you see yourself.

47:39.022 --> 47:42.317
-It's all a blur.
-Like we were hypnotized.

47:42.901 --> 47:45.237
-Creepy.
-Yeah.

47:46.488 --> 47:49.449
You like it. Don't you?

47:49.992 --> 47:53.328
No! I just said it was a little soothing.

47:53.412 --> 47:55.789
What about the machinery?
Any vulnerabilities?

47:55.873 --> 47:58.083
Something I could take apart
with the right set of tools?

47:58.166 --> 48:02.296
All you can see are chairs and helmets,
and a control room off to the side.

48:02.379 --> 48:05.257
Okay! Let's go. You guys know the way.

48:05.340 --> 48:08.760
Actually, they made us wear these goggles.
No idea where we were.

48:08.844 --> 48:10.178
KATE: So, it's the hidden passageway then.

48:10.554 --> 48:13.599
-Come on.
-But you just almost got caught.

48:13.682 --> 48:16.226
-I'll be more prepared next time.
-Stop it, Kate!

48:16.643 --> 48:18.186
STICKY: The Whisperer isn't something

48:18.270 --> 48:20.022
you can just destroy
with some screwdrivers.

48:20.188 --> 48:21.398
It's enormous.

48:22.316 --> 48:23.400
REYNIE: He's right.

48:24.484 --> 48:28.238
You said Curtain mentioned something
about a farm and a forest?

48:28.322 --> 48:30.616
Yeah, whatever that means.

48:30.699 --> 48:32.034
Could be code words.

48:34.369 --> 48:37.039
Mr. Benedict would probably know
what they mean.

48:37.748 --> 48:40.709
We're on our own right now.
The trial runs tomorrow.

48:40.792 --> 48:44.046
Curtain's, quote,
"rushing the science" to get there.

48:44.379 --> 48:45.672
We have to do something!

48:46.757 --> 48:49.009
Even if it means getting our brains swept?

48:49.635 --> 48:52.721
Might be nice, actually, to be unburdened.

48:54.348 --> 48:56.725
No, Constance, it's not nice.

48:57.517 --> 48:59.478
No one's getting brainswept.

48:59.561 --> 49:02.105
We have to figure out a way
to disable the Whisperer

49:02.189 --> 49:03.482
without getting caught.

49:06.443 --> 49:09.154
Okay. What's the plan?

49:17.579 --> 49:18.622
MAN What do you say?

49:18.705 --> 49:22.292
Keep your earnings and go home,
or double down?

49:22.376 --> 49:23.627
MAN
How may I direct your call?

49:23.710 --> 49:27.005
Hi, yes, I'd like to be connected
to the Department of Juvenile Well-Being.

49:27.089 --> 49:28.131
MAN Please hold.

49:28.215 --> 49:31.176
MAN
You said it. She's doubling down!

49:31.259 --> 49:33.887
For double your dollars and a chance
at the triple-double...

49:33.971 --> 49:34.972
WOMAN Hello.

49:35.055 --> 49:37.599
Hi. Yes, I'd like to report
an incident which took place...

49:37.683 --> 49:40.018
WOMAN The number
you dialed is no longer in service.

49:40.102 --> 49:42.980
We apologize
for the inconvenience. Goodbye.

49:45.273 --> 49:46.400
Hello?

49:47.442 --> 49:48.402
Hello?

49:48.485 --> 49:52.447
WOMAN I don't think it's Samoa
or the Pitcairn Islands.

49:53.031 --> 49:54.491
Is it Kiribati?

49:54.574 --> 49:56.284
MAN You're right!

49:56.368 --> 49:57.536
Congratulations.

49:57.911 --> 49:59.830
Greg, tell her what she's won.

50:06.128 --> 50:09.214
Why are you getting a haircut now?
It's ten o'clock.

50:11.258 --> 50:12.676
That's conventional thinking.

50:13.301 --> 50:15.137
Oh. Right.

50:16.013 --> 50:18.306
With a little bit of judgement attached,
don't you think?

50:19.099 --> 50:21.893
-I was just curious.
-Oh, come on.

50:22.436 --> 50:25.522
You know there's no such thing
as a neutral comment, son.

50:26.815 --> 50:28.066
It's so interesting.

50:29.109 --> 50:31.987
When most people are just curious
about something,

50:32.070 --> 50:34.281
they always have an opinion.

50:34.948 --> 50:38.201
-Everyone has an opinion, Dad.
-Oh, you're exactly right.

50:38.702 --> 50:41.955
-For the moment, anyway.
-Doesn't mean you have to listen to it.

50:42.873 --> 50:47.210
-Not after tomorrow.
-What's going on tomorrow?

50:49.087 --> 50:50.714
It's gonna be a very big day.

50:52.966 --> 50:54.051
Good night, son.

50:55.761 --> 50:56.970
Good night, Dad.

50:59.931 --> 51:01.058
Nice job, Paul.

51:02.434 --> 51:05.062
But you missed one little spot.

51:06.938 --> 51:08.106
Perfect.

51:10.525 --> 51:11.777
Just perfect.
