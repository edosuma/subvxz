00:11.000 --> 00:14.960
David Beckham gets the ball
yet again for Manchester United.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.160
He's really taking responsibility
every time they have possession.

00:18.200 --> 00:21.760
This reflects the way
he's been captaining England.

00:21.800 --> 00:28.680
He's dominating proceedings,
hoping perhaps to get a bit more support

00:28.920 --> 00:32.439
as he gathers the ball on this
right-hand touchline time after time.

00:32.479 --> 00:37.040
And the Old Trafford crowd warming
to the way Beckham is taking over,

00:37.080 --> 00:41.920
but the question is, where is
the goal going to come from

00:42.760 --> 00:44.600
to break down Anderlecht?

00:44.800 --> 00:49.280
Will it be Scholes? Could it be Ryan
Giggs? Would it be Beckham himself?

00:50.800 --> 00:53.200
Because Anderlecht are playing
a very controlled game.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.800
This is Radzinski,
testing the United defence,

00:57.000 --> 01:01.480
and Sylvestre possibly with a chance
to break forward on the other flank.

01:01.720 --> 01:05.120
And there's the ball
that Beckham really wants.

01:05.360 --> 01:09.080
That looked like a body check,
but he shrugged off the defender.

01:09.920 --> 01:13.760
It's a decent cross,
and there is Bhamra. It's a fine header,

01:13.960 --> 01:15.800
and she's scored!

01:16.000 --> 01:20.320
It's a goal by Jess Bhamra! A superb
header, beating the defender,

01:20.560 --> 01:25.120
and planting the ball beyond the
goalkeeper's left hand. Jess Bhamra

01:25.360 --> 01:28.040
makes a name for herself
at Old Trafford!

01:28.240 --> 01:31.720
And have we discovered
a new star here, Gary Lineker?

01:31.920 --> 01:35.840
That's right. Could Bhamra be the
answer to England's prayers? Alan?

01:36.040 --> 01:41.400
Quick thinking, comfortable on the ball,
vision and awareness - magnificent.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.600
I wish she was playing for Scotland!

01:44.800 --> 01:49.280
John, have England found the player
to relive their '66 World Cup glory?

01:49.520 --> 01:54.400
Definitely, and the best thing is,
she's not even reached her peak yet.

01:54.640 --> 01:58.720
We're joined now by Jess's mother.

01:58.760 --> 02:01.680
- You must be proud of your daughter.
- Not at all!

02:01.880 --> 02:05.600
She shouldn't be showing
her bare legs to 70,000 people!

02:05.840 --> 02:09.160
She's bringing shame on the family.
Don't encourage her!

02:09.360 --> 02:11.440
Jesminder, you get back home now!

02:12.520 --> 02:14.000
Are you listening to me?

02:15.840 --> 02:19.160
Have you gone mad? Football, shootball!

02:19.200 --> 02:22.880
Your sister's getting engaged,
and you're watching this skinhead boy!

02:23.120 --> 02:24.560
It's Beckham's corner!

02:24.760 --> 02:27.680
Come downstairs.
Your sister's going crazy.

02:29.040 --> 02:32.280
I've got to go!
Mum, where are my keys?

02:32.520 --> 02:36.320
I'm sick of this wedding
and it hasn't even started!

02:38.000 --> 02:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:50.040 --> 02:52.200
That girl is a first-class bitch!

02:52.440 --> 02:55.840
- Pinky, you've got so many others!
- I need another one!

02:56.080 --> 02:58.800
- Get a move on!
- What the hell's going on?

02:59.000 --> 03:02.960
Teet's bloody sister says she's
wearing baby pink now. Stupid cow!

03:03.160 --> 03:06.000
I had matching accessories
and everything!

03:06.200 --> 03:08.280
Mum, do I have to go shopping again?

03:08.480 --> 03:12.440
My mother chose all my 21 dowry
suits herself. I never complained.

03:12.640 --> 03:17.840
You are spoilt! Don't forget my dhania.
And more carrots. I'm making achar.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.640
Oh, Mum, don't do pickle as well!

03:20.840 --> 03:22.520
Am I asking you to make it?!

03:42.480 --> 03:45.400
Hi, Pinks! Are you all right?

03:45.600 --> 03:49.560
You haven't left everything
to the last minute, have you?

03:49.760 --> 03:51.680
Yeah. One more day of freedom!

03:53.320 --> 03:57.320
- Where did you get your contacts?
- Like 'em? They go with my hair.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.680
My fiance don't like dyed hair.

04:01.080 --> 04:05.400
Can't stand here all day. I got to
go to Ealing for my facial. Laters!

04:05.640 --> 04:07.640
Bye, Pinks. Laters.

04:07.880 --> 04:11.880
Stupid bitch! Why did she get
blue contacts? Now I can't wear mine!

04:14.880 --> 04:17.040
I'd never wear that!

04:17.279 --> 04:19.200
They're all the rage, poppet!

04:19.440 --> 04:21.519
You blow 'em up, just like a lilo.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.520
Look, this little pump comes free with it.

04:23.560 --> 04:27.400
Pop it in the valve,
pump away, up it goes,

04:27.600 --> 04:29.520
then slip it back in there...

04:29.760 --> 04:35.280
..and boom! Cleavage! They're
perfect while you're still growing

04:35.320 --> 04:36.600
'cause they lift you right there.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.120
- Mum! God, you're so embarrassing!
- They make more of what you've got.

04:39.200 --> 04:42.200
All the girls have bought one for
their daughters.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.880
The Fleur's pretty,

04:46.760 --> 04:50.840
and the gel bra's a clever one -
no pumping, it's already in there.

04:51.040 --> 04:56.120
Not the sports bras! They're
so plain! They don't enhance.

04:56.160 --> 04:58.440
- No one's going to see them.
- It's not how they look,

04:58.680 --> 05:00.600
it's how they make you feel.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.720
I really like that lace lycra one.
Uh-oh, there's your mate.

05:04.920 --> 05:08.960
I hope his mum wears a cardi
over her three stomachs tomorrow!

05:09.160 --> 05:11.240
- Shut up! She's old.
- So?

05:11.440 --> 05:13.360
All right, Jess? Hiya, Pinky.

05:16.160 --> 05:18.760
May you have a long life,
my daughters!

05:18.960 --> 05:22.000
- Getting ready for tomorrow?
- Yes, Massiji.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.320
Mum's making samosas.

05:23.400 --> 05:29.160
May God keep you and your husband
in endless happiness! And pray for me

05:29.200 --> 05:32.120
that I get a lovely daughter-in-law
like you for my Tony.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.240
Aw, thank you, Massiji! OK, bye!

05:35.480 --> 05:38.560
- How was biology?
- Did you do the genetics one?

05:38.760 --> 05:42.600
- Yes, she passed the gene to her son.
- I got that, too.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.200
- Hope I get my grades for uni.
- Come on!

05:45.440 --> 05:47.520
- Going to the park?
- I'll try.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.480
Mum!

05:53.880 --> 05:56.280
I found it! Come on, Jess!

06:02.080 --> 06:03.840
There you go! Over here!

06:05.200 --> 06:06.880
Rubbish! Come on, boys!

06:06.920 --> 06:08.840
You're such an idiot, man!

06:09.920 --> 06:13.640
- Jess! Fancy a quick game?
- I can't. My mum's waiting,

06:13.880 --> 06:18.960
- My dad's on earlies at Heathrow.
- We really need you! Come on!

06:22.560 --> 06:24.000
Come on!

06:38.920 --> 06:42.000
Who does she think she is?
Beckham or what?

06:42.240 --> 06:44.080
Can we chest it like him?

06:44.280 --> 06:47.200
- Give it some bounce!
- Go on! Chest it!

06:48.560 --> 06:50.480
Did that hurt, pretty boy?

06:59.680 --> 07:04.080
I nearly scored from 25 yards today.
Bent it and everything.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.240
I could have played all night.

07:06.480 --> 07:10.120
It's not fair that boys never have
to come home and help.

07:10.320 --> 07:14.280
If I had an arranged marriage,
would he let me play football?

07:16.680 --> 07:18.440
Who are you talking to?

07:18.640 --> 07:20.560
No one, Dad.

07:20.800 --> 07:24.840
OK, Biji and her grandson
are staying in here for the wedding.

07:25.040 --> 07:28.680
Why don't you put a nice picture
of beautiful sceneries

07:28.880 --> 07:31.800
- Instead of this bald man?
- Dad!

07:32.040 --> 07:34.880
I'm going to change.
Come and help me out, OK?

07:55.480 --> 07:57.880
..a beautiful Rolls Royce, you know?

07:58.120 --> 08:01.200
I'll get one for your wedding, too,
if you like.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.800
It will be your turn soon, eh?

08:15.040 --> 08:18.120
Do you want a clean-shaven boy
like your sister

08:18.320 --> 08:21.320
or a proper Sikh
with a full beard and a turban?

08:21.520 --> 08:25.360
It's only our men that have
a big engine and full MOT, eh?

08:45.520 --> 08:49.000
Nah, man, the alternator's gone
on the Merc!

08:49.200 --> 08:52.280
Just do the Nissan.
I told you not to bother me!

08:52.520 --> 08:54.440
It's my engagement, man!

08:56.840 --> 08:58.760
Switch it off.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.400
- He is so tick, man!
- Innit, innit? I know!

09:33.600 --> 09:35.280
He's taking his shirt off!

09:35.480 --> 09:38.960
A body like that needs
an X certificate warning!

09:39.160 --> 09:40.920
And a lifetime guarantee!

09:41.120 --> 09:43.040
- Yeah, man! Call Jess!
- Jess!

09:47.640 --> 09:51.360
- Who's that with the gorgeous bod?
- The one with the six-pack.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.360
- If he looks at me, I'll faint!
- What? Taz?

09:54.560 --> 09:56.800
- Is that his name?
- Look at that kick!

10:00.040 --> 10:01.520
He is so fly!

10:02.720 --> 10:04.640
That is fine. That is so fine!

10:06.320 --> 10:07.920
- Get your girlfriend!
- Jess!

10:08.120 --> 10:10.200
Go on. Lover boy's calling you!

10:10.400 --> 10:14.120
You know he's just my mate.
We're not all slags like you lot!

10:14.360 --> 10:18.320
Bitch! Just 'cause she's still a V,
she thinks she's better than us!

10:18.520 --> 10:22.240
At least she hasn't got off
with half of Hounslow like you two!

10:25.720 --> 10:27.560
Who's that gori watching her?

10:33.040 --> 10:35.560
Come on, Jess! It's all yours!

10:47.920 --> 10:50.760
That was brilliant!
Do you play for any side?

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
Yeah, like whose?
Southall United Sari Squad?

10:54.200 --> 10:59.400
I play for Hounslow Harriers Girls.
You should come and have a trial.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.440
- A trial? Think I'm good enough?
- Yeah.

11:02.640 --> 11:05.280
You're really good.
It's up to our coach,

11:05.480 --> 11:07.720
but we could do with some new blood.

11:07.960 --> 11:12.200
- That's brilliant!
- Do you swap shirts at the end?

11:12.400 --> 11:15.560
And have a bath together?
Where's the soap?

11:15.760 --> 11:17.680
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

11:17.920 --> 11:19.840
Let's play football.

11:20.960 --> 11:22.400
- I'm Jules.
- Jess.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.880
Yes!

11:50.920 --> 11:53.840
I want two groups of three.
Let's move!

11:56.160 --> 12:00.080
- How do you know She's serious.
- She's got balls.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.440
- At least watch her.
- Hi.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.480
- Where do you normally play?
- In the park.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.240
I mean what position?

12:09.440 --> 12:13.600
Sorry! I usually play all over,
but up front on the right is best.

12:16.160 --> 12:19.080
- Get your boots on.
- I haven't got any.

12:22.640 --> 12:25.120
Right, join in. Start warming up.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.680
- Where shall I put this?
- Put it over here.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.480
Jesus!

12:44.200 --> 12:46.120
Pass it to Jules!

12:51.240 --> 12:53.400
Brilliant!

12:59.720 --> 13:02.240
- How did it feel out there?
- Really great!

13:02.440 --> 13:05.080
I've never seen an Indian girl
into football.

13:05.280 --> 13:08.680
- I didn't know about the girls' team.
- It's her fault.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.800
When I played for the men's club,

13:11.000 --> 13:14.080
she whined that there was no team
for her to play on.

13:14.280 --> 13:15.640
I wasn't whining!

13:15.840 --> 13:19.680
There was nothing for us girls.
There was junior boys stuff,

13:19.880 --> 13:23.840
but when he busted his knee,
he set up a girls' side,

13:24.040 --> 13:26.280
and he's been on my case ever since!

13:26.520 --> 13:30.840
They made me start at the bottom.
You can't get much lower than her!

13:31.080 --> 13:33.000
You're so full of it!

13:33.240 --> 13:36.720
Nah, we get just as many trophies
as the men's side do.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.840
So, does she pass?

13:40.560 --> 13:43.560
- Are your folks up for it?
- Yeah, they're cool.

13:43.800 --> 13:46.320
Suppose you'd better come back, then.

13:46.520 --> 13:49.520
I've got to go and open the bar.
Some real work!

13:51.280 --> 13:53.840
- He likes you.
- You think so?

13:54.040 --> 13:56.560
He asked you back, didn't he?

13:56.760 --> 14:00.000
- How long have you been playing?
- For ages, but just in the park.

14:00.080 --> 14:05.240
- Nothing as serious as this.
- This, serious? It'll do for now.

14:05.480 --> 14:09.040
- I want to play professionally.
- Wow! Can you do that?

14:09.240 --> 14:11.720
Not really here,
but you can in America.

14:11.920 --> 14:15.400
They've got a pro league
with new stadiums and everything.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.000
Really?

14:18.160 --> 14:19.680
I can't believe it!

14:19.880 --> 14:24.200
It's a proper pitch with lights,
corner flags, changing rooms...

14:24.440 --> 14:26.360
The coach likes me.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.240
He really knows his stuff.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.240
Must be gutted he can't play
with his injury and all.

14:39.560 --> 14:43.280
Jules is so lucky! Her mum and dad
must really support her

14:43.480 --> 14:46.240
to let her go all the way
to America to play.

14:46.440 --> 14:50.440
I don't even know how to tell my mum
and dad about Hounslow Harriers.

14:53.440 --> 14:56.040
- Oops!
- Oh, will you both pack it in!

14:56.240 --> 14:58.560
Look at the state of my fuchsias!

14:59.360 --> 15:04.000
When are you gonna realise you have
a daughter with breasts, not a son?

15:04.200 --> 15:06.880
- Paula!
- No boy's gonna go out with a girl

15:07.080 --> 15:10.240
- who's got bigger muscles than him!
- Leave her alone.

15:10.440 --> 15:14.760
- I'm not gonna give it up!
- I saw Kevin with a blonde girl

15:15.000 --> 15:18.640
and they weren't talking
about Match of the bleedin' Day!

15:18.880 --> 15:20.880
He can shag whoever he bloody wants!

15:22.200 --> 15:26.960
Honey, all I'm saying is
there is a reason why Sporty Spice

15:27.000 --> 15:28.960
is the only one of them without a fella.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.880
- Sweetheart...
- Why don't you get off her flamin' back?

15:38.080 --> 15:42.640
If she'd rather play football than chase
boys, I'm over the moon about that.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.560
They're a bit tatty, but they'll do.
Here's a kit. You can get it dirty.

15:54.800 --> 15:58.440
- Can't I wear my tracksuit bottoms?
- No.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.600
Shit!

16:09.960 --> 16:11.880
Jess, get changed over here.

16:12.120 --> 16:15.840
- You've met our captain, Mel.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

16:16.080 --> 16:17.680
Ready for a proper match?

16:17.920 --> 16:21.560
Chiswick next. Best defensive
record in the division.

16:21.760 --> 16:24.760
- They're due for a good stuffing.
- Absolutely!

16:25.000 --> 16:28.960
We need some pace up front. Jules
could do with some decent service!

16:29.160 --> 16:30.680
Welcome to the Harriers.

16:32.560 --> 16:35.200
Painters and decorators are in.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.000
Jules, take over the warm-up.

17:05.880 --> 17:07.640
Come on, girls, keep going!

17:07.880 --> 17:09.319
Heads up!

17:10.880 --> 17:12.800
Jess, what's going on?

17:18.920 --> 17:20.359
It looks awful.

17:22.599 --> 17:26.160
- It's why I can't wear shorts ever.
- Jesus!

17:26.359 --> 17:28.280
That's a stunner!

17:28.520 --> 17:32.160
I thought I had a bad one on my knee
but yours is gorgeous.

17:34.440 --> 17:39.000
Look, don't worry about it. No one's
gonna care once you're out there.

17:41.040 --> 17:43.960
- What happened?
- You don't want to know.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.080
Look...

17:47.200 --> 17:50.200
Two operations later and it's still useless.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.320
Does yours affect your game?

17:53.560 --> 17:55.480
Nah, it just looks awful.

17:55.720 --> 17:59.640
I was eight. My mum was working
overtime at Heathrow

17:59.840 --> 18:02.520
and I was trying
to cook beans on toast.

18:02.720 --> 18:07.200
When I jumped up to the grill to get
the toast, my trousers caught alight,

18:07.440 --> 18:09.360
so my sister put me in the bath,

18:09.600 --> 18:14.480
poured cold water over me and pulled
them off but half my skin came off, too.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.320
Sorry.

18:20.560 --> 18:23.240
I know.
Put me off beans on toast for life.

18:29.160 --> 18:33.640
Come on. Mine stopped me
from playing outright, yours doesn't.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.720
- No more dawdling.
- Sorry about your knee.

18:36.920 --> 18:40.320
Yeah, yeah. I'm a right sob story,
aren't I? Come on!

18:40.520 --> 18:42.400
I want to see some sweat on you!

18:42.480 --> 18:44.080
{y:i}Well, she's all you'd ever want

18:44.280 --> 18:47.600
{y:i}She's the kind they'd like to flaunt
{y:i}and take to dinner

18:49.520 --> 18:52.440
{y:i}And she always knows her place
{y:i}She's got style, she's got grace

18:52.680 --> 18:54.520
{y:i}She's a winner

18:56.320 --> 18:58.000
{y:i}She's a lady!

18:58.200 --> 18:59.880
{y:i}Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

19:00.080 --> 19:01.600
{y:i}She's a lady

19:01.800 --> 19:05.040
{y:i}I'm talking about my little lady

19:05.280 --> 19:09.680
{y:i}Oh, whoa, whoa, she's a lady! Lady!

19:24.440 --> 19:26.200
{y:i}Well, she's a lady!

19:31.880 --> 19:35.800
- Hey, Tony!
- Are you here for fantasy football?

19:36.000 --> 19:39.400
- You look like a pro!
- It's brilliant. They're a top team

19:39.640 --> 19:41.720
- and the coach is ace.
- Excellent!

19:41.960 --> 19:44.960
- What's that?
- Haven't you seen a burn before?

19:45.200 --> 19:48.440
- That's disgusting, man!
- Back off, you wanker!

19:48.640 --> 19:50.000
No, it's fine.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.440
At least I can still skin you alive!

20:00.480 --> 20:02.400
The skill, the skill!

20:02.600 --> 20:04.280
The skill!

20:10.040 --> 20:11.480
That's not fair!

20:17.920 --> 20:21.480
He touched you all over!
Put his hands on your bare legs!

20:21.720 --> 20:26.040
You're not a young girl any more!
And showing the world your scar!

20:27.240 --> 20:31.040
Jessie, now that your sister's engaged,
it's different.

20:31.240 --> 20:35.240
- You know how people talk.
- She's getting married, not me!

20:35.440 --> 20:39.240
I was married at your age!
You won't even learn to cook dhal!

20:39.440 --> 20:42.840
- I'm not playing with boys any more.
- Good! End of matter!

20:43.040 --> 20:48.440
I'm in a girls' team, playing proper
matches. The coach said I could go far.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.800
Go far? Go far to where?

20:52.760 --> 20:55.840
We let you play all you wanted
when you were young, huh?

20:55.880 --> 20:58.960
- You've played enough.
- That's not fair! He selected me!

20:58.960 --> 21:01.960
He?! She said it was girls!

21:02.200 --> 21:04.960
- The coach, Joe.
- See how she lies?

21:05.160 --> 21:09.000
I don't want you running around
half naked in front of men, huh?

21:09.200 --> 21:12.440
Look how dark you've become,
playing in the sun!

21:12.640 --> 21:16.280
- But I'm really good!
- Who will want a daughter-in-law

21:16.520 --> 21:18.520
who can kick a football all day

21:18.720 --> 21:20.200
but can't make round chapattis?

21:20.880 --> 21:25.600
Now exams are over, you'll learn
full Punjabi dinner, meat and vegetarian!

21:25.800 --> 21:29.160
- But, Dad!
- No! This is where you spoil her!

21:29.200 --> 21:31.680
This is how it started with your niece,

21:31.880 --> 21:35.920
and she ran off to become
a model wearing small, small skirts!

21:36.120 --> 21:39.120
- She's a fashion designer!
- She's divorced!

21:39.320 --> 21:43.720
Cast off after three years of being
married to a white boy with blue hair!

21:43.960 --> 21:48.200
Her poor mother hasn't been able
to set foot in that temple since.

21:48.440 --> 21:51.280
I don't want the shame on my family.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.920
That's it! No more football!

21:54.960 --> 21:57.280
Jessie, your mother is right.

21:57.520 --> 22:02.640
It's not nice. You must start
behaving like a proper woman. OK?

22:07.760 --> 22:11.000
Anything I want
is just not Indian enough for 'em!

22:11.200 --> 22:16.000
I never bunked off school. I don't
wear make-up or tight clothes.

22:16.040 --> 22:19.480
- They don't see that!
- Parents never see the good things.

22:19.680 --> 22:20.800
Anyone can cook aloo gobi,

22:20.840 --> 22:25.000
- but who can bend a ball like Beckham?
- Just play and don't tell them.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.480
Pinky's been sneaking off for years
to see Teets.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.560
What your parents don't know
won't hurt.

22:32.880 --> 22:37.120
Why should I have to lie? It's not like
I'm sleeping around with anyone!

22:37.760 --> 22:41.400
Jess! Hello!

22:41.920 --> 22:43.520
I thought you'd be here.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.040
This is Tony.
This is Jules from the team.

22:45.960 --> 22:48.120
Jess is well made up with your team.

22:48.320 --> 22:51.000
We've got high hopes for her,
especially me.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.800
My mum doesn't want me to play
any more.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.160
That's bollocks!
My mum's never wanted me to play.

22:57.360 --> 22:59.360
You can't take no for an answer.

22:59.600 --> 23:03.840
Yeah, but my sister's getting married
so Mum and Dad are stressed out.

23:04.080 --> 23:07.160
I won't be able to get
to training and matches.

23:07.360 --> 23:10.440
Come on, Jess.
You can't leave me alone out there.

23:10.640 --> 23:15.120
Joe has an American scout coming over.
Don't worry about your mum.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.240
Just say you got a summer job.

23:17.480 --> 23:21.520
I could put in a good word for you
at HMV with me. So...

23:21.720 --> 23:25.440
..now we've got that sorted,
show me what your fella can do!

23:25.640 --> 23:28.800
- He's not my boyfriend!
- I'm not her boyfriend!

23:30.160 --> 23:32.160
Jess, come on! Are you playing?

23:38.840 --> 23:40.360
Jessie! Breakfast!

23:40.600 --> 23:42.440
Nah, I'm in a hurry!

23:42.640 --> 23:45.480
You can't go to work
on an empty stomach.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.600
Where's my keys?

23:47.840 --> 23:50.240
- Jessie!
- No, I'm late, Mum.

23:50.440 --> 23:51.880
Bye!

24:10.280 --> 24:11.720
{y:i}Hush now, child

24:13.480 --> 24:14.840
{y:i}And don't you cry

24:16.920 --> 24:19.240
{y:i}Your folks might understand you

24:19.960 --> 24:21.440
{y:i}By and by

24:23.000 --> 24:24.280
{y:i}Just move on up

24:25.960 --> 24:28.480
{y:i}Towards your destination

24:28.680 --> 24:30.760
{y:i}Though you may find

24:31.000 --> 24:32.440
{y:i}From time to time

24:32.640 --> 24:34.400
{y:i}Complications

24:49.280 --> 24:50.960
{y:i}Bite your lip

24:52.360 --> 24:54.440
{y:i}And take a trip

24:55.520 --> 24:58.840
{y:i}Though there may be
{y:i}wet roads ahead

24:59.040 --> 25:00.520
{y:i}And you cannot slip

25:02.160 --> 25:03.680
{y:i}Just move on up

25:05.800 --> 25:07.320
{y:i}For peace you will find

25:09.240 --> 25:12.320
{y:i}Into the steeple
{y:i}of beautiflul people

25:12.560 --> 25:14.160
{y:i}Where there's only one kind

25:16.000 --> 25:17.680
{y:i}So hush now, child

25:19.440 --> 25:20.920
{y:i}And don't you cry

25:22.080 --> 25:24.480
{y:i}Your folks might understand you

25:25.720 --> 25:27.120
{y:i}By and by

25:28.800 --> 25:30.240
{y:i}Move on up

25:32.680 --> 25:34.520
{y:i}And keep on wishing

25:36.000 --> 25:38.920
{y:i}Remember your dream
{y:i}is your only scheme

25:39.120 --> 25:40.560
{y:i}So keep on pushing

25:55.400 --> 25:57.400
{y:i}Just move on up

25:58.960 --> 26:00.400
{y:i}Move on up!

26:28.800 --> 26:30.720
Get off me, man!

26:30.960 --> 26:32.880
No one can see us.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.160
Yeah?

26:41.360 --> 26:43.280
Mum!

26:43.520 --> 26:46.440
No, no, nothing,
I'm just at work, innit?

26:46.680 --> 26:49.600
Yeah, I know Poli's
coming to do the suits.

26:50.840 --> 26:52.840
So Jess can get the tube, innit?

26:53.080 --> 26:55.840
Yeah, all right, I'll pick her up.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.560
I've got to go, Mum,
someone's coming.

27:00.760 --> 27:03.000
My mum and dad ain't got a clue.

27:03.240 --> 27:06.160
- They don't know you've been playing?
- No.

27:06.360 --> 27:09.280
- Where do they think you are?
- Working at HMV.

27:09.520 --> 27:12.800
- That's not on.
- Indian girls don't play football!

27:14.000 --> 27:18.080
It's not just an Indian thing.
How many people support us?

27:18.320 --> 27:20.160
Are you promised to someone?

27:20.360 --> 27:23.680
Nah. My sister's getting married.
It's a love match.

27:23.880 --> 27:26.680
- What's that mean?
- It's not arranged.

27:26.880 --> 27:29.720
- So, could you choose a white boy?
- White, no,

27:29.920 --> 27:32.600
black, definitely not, a Muslim, eh-eh!

27:32.800 --> 27:35.800
- You'll marry an Indian, then!
- Probably.

27:36.040 --> 27:38.600
- How can you stand it?
- It's just culture.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.720
Why sleep with boys
you aren't going to marry?

27:41.920 --> 27:45.080
- That's the best bit!
- Yeah, you should know!

27:47.520 --> 27:51.080
Are you ready to go?
See you slags later!

28:02.360 --> 28:04.280
It's only me.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.240
Mum, I'm starving. I worked
through my lunch hour today.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.920
Where's Pinky?
She was supposed to pick you up

28:19.120 --> 28:21.200
so you wouldn't be late for Poli.

28:23.040 --> 28:26.200
Pinky, why didn't you pick
your sister up from work, huh?

28:26.200 --> 28:28.440
I went but the manager said
I'd just missed her.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.560
OK, Poli's on her way.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.720
I'll make you girls some tea.

28:37.160 --> 28:39.000
- Who is he, then?
- Who?

28:39.200 --> 28:43.160
You must think I've got shit for brains,
lying about a job and that!

28:43.360 --> 28:46.360
Don't tell Mum and Dad.
I kept Teet a secret for you.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.920
- He's not a Muslim, is he?
- Ssh!

28:49.120 --> 28:52.360
I've been playing football
for a women's team.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.520
Huh? It's worse than I thought!

28:54.760 --> 28:59.240
- It's a tournament with real matches!
- What is wrong with you, Jess?

28:59.440 --> 29:01.520
At least lie for something good!

29:01.760 --> 29:04.840
Don't you want a boyfriend
like everyone else?

29:05.040 --> 29:09.000
You're quite pretty. Do your hair,
some make-up, you'd look all right.

29:09.200 --> 29:13.160
Leave her alone. I never wore
make-up until after I was married.

29:13.360 --> 29:16.840
Jessie's a good girl.
She helped me wash the net curtains

29:17.040 --> 29:19.720
and she made lovely aloo gobi
last week.

29:22.560 --> 29:26.640
Waist 25...under bust 28...

29:27.240 --> 29:30.640
- Bust...
- Eh, that's too tight and rude!

29:30.840 --> 29:34.000
No, Mum, I want my choli more fitted.
That's the style, innit?

29:34.080 --> 29:36.120
- 34 and a half.
- No, tighter!

29:36.160 --> 29:39.760
- OK, 34!
- How are you going to breathe?

29:40.800 --> 29:44.360
Mum, why do I have to wear
a sari? It will just fall down!

29:44.560 --> 29:47.320
Your first sari
is when you become a woman.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.440
Sari blouse and petticoat.

29:50.520 --> 29:54.920
- So...bust...31...
- That's too tight. I want it looser.

29:55.160 --> 29:58.400
Dressed in a sack,
who's going to notice you, huh?

29:58.600 --> 30:00.840
Don't worry. In one of our designs,

30:01.080 --> 30:04.800
even these mosquito bites
will look like juicy mangoes!

30:06.120 --> 30:08.040
Under the bust, 27.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.120
The waist, 27.

30:10.360 --> 30:13.520
I need to buy different shoes
to go with the sari and the suits.

30:13.760 --> 30:16.680
- Come again?
- She's coming into line now!

30:16.920 --> 30:19.720
I can pay for one pair.
Can you pay for the other?

30:19.920 --> 30:23.400
You need one black and one white
to go with everything.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
{y:i}I know I make mistakes

30:27.240 --> 30:29.080
{y:i}I will have to live and learn

30:31.480 --> 30:34.320
{y:i}Sometimes you play with fire

30:34.560 --> 30:37.720
{y:i}And sometimes you get burned

30:38.960 --> 30:41.880
{y:i}I have my dream to live

30:42.120 --> 30:45.040
{y:i}Following that star

30:46.160 --> 30:49.640
{y:i}It doesn't matter how long it takes

30:49.840 --> 30:53.320
{y:i}It doesn't matter how far

30:54.160 --> 30:57.640
{y:i}No time for make-believing

30:57.840 --> 31:02.720
{y:i}And it's too late to turn back now

31:02.920 --> 31:05.080
{y:i}Yeah, yeah, yeah

31:05.280 --> 31:07.600
{y:i}I've been dreaming about it

31:07.840 --> 31:10.000
{y:i}I can't live without it

31:10.240 --> 31:12.480
{y:i}I've got to find my own way

31:12.720 --> 31:15.360
{y:i}I'm not changing my mind now

31:15.560 --> 31:17.160
{y:i}Or looking behind now

31:17.400 --> 31:20.160
{y:i}This is my Independence

31:20.360 --> 31:22.680
{y:i}Day

31:22.880 --> 31:25.800
{y:i}My Independence Day!

31:32.880 --> 31:36.600
- Can you change the channel, please?
- It's nearly the end.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.760
Mum, she's back!

31:40.000 --> 31:43.640
You've been gone all day
for two pairs of shoes! Come here!

31:43.840 --> 31:47.000
It's not that late.
I was looking at handbags, too.

31:47.240 --> 31:50.800
- Let's see 'em!
- Not yet. I'll try them with the suits.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.920
Cigarette?

31:59.120 --> 32:01.120
- Have you been smoking?
- No!

32:01.320 --> 32:02.760
Cigarette!

32:04.600 --> 32:07.680
I needed the loo
so I went into a pub with my friend.

32:07.920 --> 32:09.760
I had a coke. Smell my breath!

32:11.640 --> 32:13.120
She might be right.

32:13.320 --> 32:18.400
These don't have a heel!
How will they fall nicely with your sari?

32:18.440 --> 32:19.400
I'll take them back.

32:21.280 --> 32:23.200
Football shoes!

32:26.760 --> 32:28.520
But you can't give 'em back.

32:28.760 --> 32:33.800
- I need shoes for the wedding now.
- Come over to mine. I'll sort you out.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.920
Come on, girls! Wake up!

32:36.160 --> 32:38.720
God! My mum had a fit
when she saw the boots!

32:38.920 --> 32:41.000
And I smelt like a bleedin' ashtray!

32:41.200 --> 32:43.600
I had to clean all the big saucepans.

32:43.840 --> 32:45.160
Yak, yak! Jess!

32:46.560 --> 32:49.120
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, coach.

32:49.320 --> 32:51.720
Am I interrupting your conversation?

32:51.920 --> 32:55.320
- No, coach.
- Good. Five more laps round the pitch!

32:55.520 --> 32:59.400
- Elbows to knees as you go!
- Joe, that is totally out of order!

32:59.600 --> 33:03.080
Hey! I don't remember telling
the rest of you to stop!

33:03.320 --> 33:07.880
Move it! You're doing very well.
Keep it up for another two minutes.

33:08.880 --> 33:11.040
Good, Mackie! Good, Sally!

33:11.240 --> 33:13.160
Excellent! Excellent!

33:17.960 --> 33:20.280
Jess! You can stop now!

33:29.520 --> 33:31.800
Stop! You're doing yourself an injury!

33:31.840 --> 33:35.320
- I'm OK. I've just got one more lap.
- I said stop!

33:36.560 --> 33:38.240
Let's have a look at you.

33:38.480 --> 33:42.360
- It's nothing!
- Sit down. Let me decide if it's nothing.

33:43.680 --> 33:46.320
Why didn't you tell me you'd twisted it?

33:46.520 --> 33:50.080
I didn't want you to think
I'm not as strong as the others.

33:50.280 --> 33:52.120
That's stupid, Jess.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.400
Look, my dad was my coach. Scouts
told him that I was too slight to play,

33:59.600 --> 34:03.080
so he kept pushing me.
That's how I screwed my knee.

34:04.120 --> 34:05.880
Your dad made you?

34:07.120 --> 34:10.960
I wanted to show him I wasn't soft,
so I tried to play injured.

34:12.520 --> 34:16.520
- He was a bastard anyway.
- You shouldn't say that about your dad.

34:16.719 --> 34:18.639
You don't know my dad.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.280
All right. Come on.

34:33.199 --> 34:35.120
Good. Now put your weight on me.

34:36.159 --> 34:37.520
There you are.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.480
Oh, my God!

34:47.719 --> 34:50.480
Just give 'em back after the wedding.

34:50.679 --> 34:53.679
My mum loves them.
She stuck the bows on herself.

34:53.920 --> 34:56.760
- Thanks. You sure she won't miss 'em?
- Nah.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.080
Listen...
I hope Joe wasn't too hard on you.

35:00.320 --> 35:02.800
Some of the girls think he's too strict.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.160
No, he was really nice,
just really professional.

35:06.400 --> 35:10.120
I love that picture. It was
after we beat Millwall last year.

35:10.320 --> 35:13.000
You got to see this. It's wicked!

35:14.880 --> 35:16.880
W.U.S.A. soccer!

35:18.560 --> 35:20.640
- Wow!
- W.U.S.A.

35:20.840 --> 35:23.760
Incredible!
We've nothing like that over here.

35:25.240 --> 35:28.960
Goal! Mia Hamm,
world footballer of the year!

35:29.200 --> 35:31.200
Milbrett makes a run.

35:31.440 --> 35:35.000
She shoots! Goal!
Tiffany Milbrett scores again!

35:35.240 --> 35:37.240
Lily strikes... Save!

35:37.440 --> 35:38.880
Brandi Chastain!

35:40.160 --> 35:42.240
Saved! Smith beats the keeper!

35:42.480 --> 35:45.560
Goal for Kelly Smith,
the England international!

35:45.760 --> 35:49.400
When are you going to tell
your parents about your game?

35:49.600 --> 35:51.840
- I don't know.
- You can't keep lying. You're too good.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.600
- Cooey!
- Hide the shoes!

35:54.600 --> 35:58.080
- Sweetheart!
- Up here, Mum.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.920
Oh, it's hot out there!

36:02.160 --> 36:04.080
Oh! Got company!

36:04.320 --> 36:06.400
- Hello, love.
- Mum, this is Jess.

36:06.640 --> 36:08.560
Jess?

36:08.800 --> 36:10.480
Is that Indian?

36:10.680 --> 36:14.000
It's really Jesminder,
but only my mum calls me that.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.480
Oh, that's nice. Jesmin-dah.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.720
Lovely!

36:18.960 --> 36:24.320
Well, Jesmin-dah, I bet your room
at home doesn't look like this!

36:24.520 --> 36:28.600
- Big butch women on the wall!
- Thanks, Mum, I'm not old like you!

36:29.160 --> 36:33.200
Jess, I hope you can teach
my daughter a bit about your culture,

36:33.400 --> 36:38.200
including respect
for elders and the like, eh?

36:39.320 --> 36:40.840
Cheeky madam!

36:41.040 --> 36:42.800
Well, Jess...

36:43.040 --> 36:48.400
I expect your parents are fixing you up
with a handsome young doctor soon.

36:48.480 --> 36:51.880
- Pretty girl like you...
- Mum! Stop embarrassing yourself!

36:52.080 --> 36:54.000
What?

36:54.760 --> 36:57.920
Just being friendly!
You don't mind, do you, love?

36:58.160 --> 37:00.800
Now, are you a friend
from school or work?

37:01.000 --> 37:04.800
She's a footballer.
She's on the team with me.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.520
"Jesmin-dah"!

37:16.760 --> 37:18.840
Did you see her face, though?!

37:19.040 --> 37:22.040
- Juliet!
- Jesmin-dah! What was that?

37:23.080 --> 37:25.480
- Are you all right?
- Oh, Jesus!

37:29.560 --> 37:31.000
Jules...

37:31.200 --> 37:34.280
You know Joe, do you like him?

37:34.480 --> 37:39.040
Nah, he'd get sacked if he was
caught shagging one of his players.

37:39.240 --> 37:40.760
Really?

37:40.960 --> 37:43.200
I wish I could find a bloke like him.

37:43.440 --> 37:47.920
Everyone I know's a prat. They think
girls can't play as well as them,

37:48.160 --> 37:49.840
except Joe, of course.

37:50.040 --> 37:53.120
Yeah, I hope I marry
an Indian boy like him, too.

37:54.320 --> 37:55.840
- What?
- I'm sorry!

37:56.080 --> 37:57.360
Shut up!

38:12.600 --> 38:17.240
We're not trying to cause trouble.
We felt it our duty to tell you.

38:21.400 --> 38:24.160
You know how hard it is
for our children here.

38:24.360 --> 38:28.200
Sometimes they misjudge and start
behaving like the kids here.

38:28.400 --> 38:32.720
All I know is that children
are a map of their parents.

38:42.560 --> 38:46.480
- You stupid flippin' cow!
- You've ruined your sister's life!

38:46.680 --> 38:49.520
- Happy now?
- The wedding's off 'cause of you!

38:49.720 --> 38:52.960
- Me? Why?
- They saw you being filthy

38:53.200 --> 38:54.520
with an English boy!

38:54.720 --> 38:58.720
- I wasn't with any English boy!
- You were at a bus stop kissing him!

38:58.920 --> 39:01.760
Why didn't you do it in secret
like everyone else?

39:02.000 --> 39:05.080
Kissing? Me? A boy?!

39:06.800 --> 39:09.800
- You're all bloody mad!
- Jesminder, don't swear!

39:10.000 --> 39:14.800
I was at the 120 bus stop today
but with Juliet. My friend.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.240
She's a girl, and we weren't kissing
or anything for God's sake!

39:19.480 --> 39:22.160
- Swear by Babaji.
- I swear on Babaji's name.

39:33.360 --> 39:37.160
Sometimes these English girls
have such short hair...

39:38.360 --> 39:40.280
You just can't tell.

39:42.840 --> 39:44.760
They must have made a mistake.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.560
His parents are just making an excuse.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.840
We were never good enough for them.

39:50.040 --> 39:53.840
No, I bet she was with some dykey
girl from her football team!

39:54.040 --> 39:57.600
She's still playing! She ain't
got no job! She's been lying!

39:57.800 --> 40:00.200
Why have I two deceiving daughters?

40:00.400 --> 40:04.560
- What did I do wrong in my past life?
- But she's ruined my life!

40:06.440 --> 40:10.840
I knew you were sneaking out
with that good-for-nothing Teetu as well!

40:28.560 --> 40:32.880
- Well, just talk to them, innit?
- I'll come and talk to your parents.

40:45.240 --> 40:47.160
Jules, come here to me.

40:52.440 --> 40:55.040
- Where's your mate?
- I don't know.

40:55.240 --> 40:58.880
This is the second training session
in a row she's missed.

40:59.080 --> 41:01.000
It's not like her.

41:01.240 --> 41:03.880
Did she say she was unhappy
with anything?

41:04.080 --> 41:08.160
Her parents didn't know she was
on the team. Maybe they found out.

41:09.560 --> 41:12.160
What? She said her folks were up for it.

41:12.360 --> 41:15.520
I've told her to tell them
but she won't listen to me.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.200
I'll get it!

41:29.960 --> 41:32.040
- Yeah?
- Hello.

41:40.720 --> 41:42.480
Thanks, Jess.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.720
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this,

41:52.920 --> 41:55.160
but I wanted to talk to you in person.

41:55.360 --> 41:59.080
I found out today that you didn't
know Jess was playing for us.

41:59.280 --> 42:00.600
No, we didn't.

42:00.800 --> 42:05.360
I apologise. If I'd known, I would
have encouraged Jess to tell you

42:05.560 --> 42:08.120
because she's got tremendous potential.

42:08.320 --> 42:13.120
We know better our daughter's potential.
Jess has no time for games.

42:13.360 --> 42:17.680
- She'll start university soon.
- But playing for the team is an honour!

42:17.920 --> 42:20.360
What bigger honour is there
than respecting your elders?

42:19.880 --> 42:24.600
Young man,
When I was a teenager in Nairobi,

42:24.800 --> 42:27.320
I was the best fast bowler in our school.

42:27.520 --> 42:30.440
Our team even won the East African Cup.

42:30.680 --> 42:33.400
But when I came to this country, nothing.

42:34.280 --> 42:36.880
I was not allowed to play in any team,

42:37.080 --> 42:40.960
and the bloody goras in their
clubhouses made fun of my turban

42:41.160 --> 42:42.640
and sent me off packing!

42:42.840 --> 42:44.760
I'm sorry, Mr Bhamra...

42:45.840 --> 42:48.000
-..but now it's...
- Now what?

42:48.200 --> 42:50.800
Our boys aren't in the football leagues.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.920
You think they will let our girls?

42:53.160 --> 42:56.560
I don't want you to build up
Jesminder's hopes.

42:56.760 --> 42:59.480
She will only end up
disappointed like me.

42:59.680 --> 43:04.080
It's changing now. Nasser Hussein
is captain of the English cricket team

43:04.320 --> 43:07.400
- and he's Asian.
- Muslim families are different.

43:07.600 --> 43:09.680
Oh, Mum!

43:13.760 --> 43:17.080
We've been invited to play
in Germany this Saturday.

43:17.320 --> 43:20.400
- It's a shame you'll miss it.
- Wow! Germany!

43:22.320 --> 43:26.720
I can see what you're up against, but
parents don't always know what's best.

43:35.080 --> 43:37.000
They're all here.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.840
They're all in, yeah?

43:41.240 --> 43:42.600
Shit!

43:43.600 --> 43:48.800
- You know the score, yeah?
- Yeah, call them twice a day.

43:49.040 --> 43:50.960
My sister's covering for me.

43:51.200 --> 43:54.840
- We're supposed to be at my cousin's.
- I didn't hear that!

44:10.040 --> 44:15.080
{y:i}Uh-huh, make me tonight

44:15.280 --> 44:17.960
{y:i}Tonight

44:18.160 --> 44:21.080
{y:i}Make it right

44:23.720 --> 44:28.680
{y:i}Uh-huh, make me tonight

44:28.920 --> 44:31.840
{y:i}Tonight

44:32.040 --> 44:35.600
{y:i}Tonight

44:35.800 --> 44:39.880
{y:i}Oh, oh-hoh, make it
{y:i}magnificent...

44:42.120 --> 44:43.800
Jess! Cross it, Jess!

44:59.160 --> 45:00.680
Good luck.

45:14.120 --> 45:16.520
Go on, Jess, you can do this!

45:34.560 --> 45:36.800
Mum, we're fine. We're cooking...

45:37.040 --> 45:39.200
- Pasta!
-..pasta! I'd better go...

45:39.440 --> 45:42.840
Pinky's burning it!
OK, say hi to Dad, yeah?

45:43.080 --> 45:45.000
OK. Bye, Mum.

45:48.360 --> 45:52.160
Good. They sound happy.
Pinky will meet someone new

45:52.200 --> 45:55.480
and Jessie will forget
all about this football nonsense.

45:55.680 --> 45:57.120
The dinner's ready?

45:59.480 --> 46:01.400
But let me wash up first.

46:09.080 --> 46:12.080
Call her back in Croydon.
I want to speak to them.

46:12.320 --> 46:14.960
- I said I want to speak to them!
- OK, baba.

46:20.640 --> 46:22.800
I didn't bring anything for a club.

46:23.040 --> 46:27.120
I didn't know they wanted to take us
clubbing. I bet it's to gloat!

46:32.280 --> 46:34.800
Mel? We need some help.

46:43.320 --> 46:44.760
Jess!

46:44.960 --> 46:46.880
Oh, wow! You look good!

46:48.160 --> 46:52.640
- Does she look good?
- Yeah! You've done a good job!

46:54.880 --> 46:56.240
Let's get a taxi.

47:04.360 --> 47:05.720
Hello, darling!

47:05.920 --> 47:08.320
- How's Jules?
- I'm fine. How are you?

47:11.480 --> 47:12.280
- Are you gonna dance with me, then?
- No.

47:12.320 --> 47:17.000
Come on! Dance with me!
Oh, you're such a wuss!

47:17.240 --> 47:20.320
I'm sorry I missed that penalty, coach.

47:20.520 --> 47:25.080
It's OK. Losing to the Jerries on penalties
comes natural to you English!

47:25.320 --> 47:27.240
You're part of a tradition now.

47:27.480 --> 47:30.480
Enough about football.
You're dancing with me!

47:30.720 --> 47:32.640
- No!
- Go on!

47:32.880 --> 47:34.800
I'm not taking no for an answer!

47:37.200 --> 47:38.680
{y:i}I turn to you

47:38.880 --> 47:42.360
{y:i}Like a flower
{y:i}leaning towards the sun

47:43.360 --> 47:44.880
{y:i}I turn to you

47:46.120 --> 47:48.120
{y:i}'Cause you're the only one

47:49.320 --> 47:52.240
{y:i}Who can turn me around

47:53.480 --> 47:55.000
{y:i}When I'm upside down

47:55.200 --> 47:56.680
{y:i}Down, down

47:56.880 --> 48:01.680
{y:i}I turn to you
{y:i}I turn to you

48:05.200 --> 48:08.280
{y:i}When my insides are racked
{y:i}with anxiety

48:12.160 --> 48:14.840
{y:i}You have the touch
{y:i}that will quiet me

48:18.600 --> 48:21.840
{y:i}You lift my spirit
{y:i}You melt the ice

48:22.040 --> 48:23.480
{y:i}The ice, the ice

48:24.960 --> 48:27.880
{y:i}When I need inspiration
{y:i}when I need advice

48:29.960 --> 48:31.880
{y:i}I turn to you

48:32.120 --> 48:35.680
{y:i}Like a flower
{y:i}leaning towards the sun

48:35.920 --> 48:38.560
{y:i}I turn to you

48:39.640 --> 48:41.800
{y:i}'Cause you're the only one

48:43.360 --> 48:45.280
{y:i}Who can turn me around...

48:48.680 --> 48:50.600
Jess!

48:50.840 --> 48:52.920
Whoa! Steady on there, young one!

48:54.160 --> 48:56.080
Are you all right?

48:56.320 --> 48:58.240
Are you sure?

49:01.160 --> 49:02.680
Gosh!

49:04.240 --> 49:06.160
I only had a couple of wines!

49:08.480 --> 49:09.920
Oh, my head!

49:13.240 --> 49:15.720
- It's too smoky in there.
- Yeah.

49:17.280 --> 49:19.200
{y:i}I wish I

49:19.440 --> 49:21.360
{y:i}Could right now

49:21.600 --> 49:23.920
{y:i}Wish that I could show you how...

49:24.560 --> 49:27.640
That was so brilliant
the way you came to my house.

49:29.880 --> 49:32.440
You were brave enough to face my mum!

49:32.640 --> 49:34.560
Your dad can't be as mad as her!

49:34.800 --> 49:37.960
Your mam's a barrel of laughs
compared to me dad!

49:39.160 --> 49:42.080
I don't need to feel close
to my family, Jess.

49:43.120 --> 49:45.360
I don't need you to feel sorry for me.

49:52.840 --> 49:55.160
You bitch!

50:00.360 --> 50:02.280
Shit! Jules.

50:15.360 --> 50:16.800
Jules!

50:18.440 --> 50:20.360
You all right, Jess?

50:21.640 --> 50:23.560
Is that your mum and dad?

50:45.040 --> 50:48.040
What haven't we done
for these girls, huh?

50:48.280 --> 50:50.200
We bought a car for Pinky.

50:50.440 --> 50:52.600
Jessie wanted computer,

50:52.800 --> 50:55.720
music centre, TV, video, huh?

51:01.160 --> 51:02.680
Pinks...

51:03.960 --> 51:05.880
How do you know Teets is the one?

51:07.160 --> 51:08.520
I just know.

51:08.720 --> 51:13.120
When you're in love with someone,
you'd do anything for that person.

51:16.160 --> 51:20.360
Pinks, do you think Mum and Dad
would still speak to me

51:20.400 --> 51:21.640
if I ever brought home a gora?

51:21.880 --> 51:24.560
- Who?!
- No one. I'm just saying.

51:24.760 --> 51:28.400
It's that coach! I knew something
was up when he turned up here!

51:28.640 --> 51:32.600
- Nothing's happened.
- Well, make sure it doesn't, all right?

51:37.760 --> 51:42.880
You can marry anyone you want.
It's fine at first when you're in love

51:43.000 --> 51:46.240
but do you want to be stared at
at every family do

51:46.280 --> 51:47.480
because you married the English bloke?

51:47.680 --> 51:49.920
He's Irish.

51:50.120 --> 51:54.360
Well, they look the bloody same to
them, innit? Why go to so much grief

51:54.560 --> 51:56.320
when there's so many good-looking
Indian boys to marry?

51:56.360 --> 51:58.240
It's not like before, you know?

51:58.280 --> 51:59.000
They wear good clothes,

51:59.040 --> 52:03.560
got flashy jobs and even know
how to cook and wash up.

52:03.600 --> 52:05.800
Tony's been mad on you for ages!

52:55.200 --> 52:56.800
Jess?

53:01.560 --> 53:03.920
Was that the club chairman?

53:04.160 --> 53:06.800
Yeah. They told me
they're considering me

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
as assistant coach
for the men's side next year.

53:09.120 --> 53:12.320
That's great! Congratulations.

53:12.560 --> 53:16.600
Probably won't get it.
Better not to count on anything.

53:16.800 --> 53:18.720
Well, you deserve it.

53:20.560 --> 53:24.000
- I really wanted to say...
- I've already forgotten about it.

53:25.880 --> 53:27.040
Yeah, good. Me, too.

53:29.160 --> 53:33.320
Your parents didn't look too pleased
yesterday. Have you come to tell me

53:33.360 --> 53:34.360
you're off the team for good?

53:36.600 --> 53:42.000
It's not fair. I'm either going to
let the team down or piss them off,

53:42.040 --> 53:43.480
and I don't want to upset anyone.

53:44.600 --> 53:46.040
Why are they so frightened
to let you play?

53:47.160 --> 53:48.360
They want to protect me.

53:49.200 --> 53:50.960
From what?

53:51.480 --> 53:54.560
This is taking me away
from everything they know.

53:58.800 --> 54:03.320
Whose life are you living, Jess?
If you try pleasing 'em for ever,

54:03.520 --> 54:05.360
you're gonna end up blaming 'em.

54:05.600 --> 54:07.000
What, like you?

54:10.840 --> 54:13.080
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're right.

54:13.840 --> 54:17.880
I stopped talking to my dad because
we had nothing to talk about.

54:19.480 --> 54:21.320
Spent a year getting pissed

54:21.560 --> 54:24.800
trying to forget about the game,
but I couldn't.

54:25.040 --> 54:28.360
Yeah, but I can't just stop talking
to them, like you.

54:28.600 --> 54:30.440
I don't talk to my dad

54:30.680 --> 54:32.440
because I know what he'd say.

54:32.680 --> 54:35.840
He'd piss himself if he knew
I was coaching girls!

54:36.040 --> 54:40.920
How do you know that he wouldn't be
proud that you didn't just give up?

54:43.320 --> 54:46.800
You should be proud
of what you've given all of us.

54:49.160 --> 54:51.320
Then why are you giving up?

55:03.680 --> 55:06.120
- Jesmin-dah, isn't it?
- Jesminder.

55:06.200 --> 55:10.480
Jesminder, oh yeah, I'm sorry.
I cooked a lovely curry the other day!

55:14.600 --> 55:17.760
Oh, you still not up?
Guess who's come to see you.

55:17.960 --> 55:21.040
It's your Indian friend, from football.

55:30.240 --> 55:33.560
Jules has been ever so down
since you lost in Germany.

55:33.800 --> 55:38.120
Maybe you can cheer her up.
Want some tea?

55:38.160 --> 55:40.960
I've just made some
cheese straws with real Gruyere.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.840
No It's all right.
Jess won't be staying long.

55:46.760 --> 55:48.680
Well...

55:49.920 --> 55:52.080
..just give us a shout downstairs

55:52.280 --> 55:55.520
if there's anything
you two fancy, all right?

56:04.400 --> 56:07.240
Look, I feel really bad
about what happened.

56:07.440 --> 56:09.360
Yeah, well, you should.

56:09.600 --> 56:14.240
I'm sorry. I don't want you
to be in a strop with me.

56:14.480 --> 56:16.880
I'm not in a strop!

56:17.080 --> 56:20.400
Look, it was a mistake.
I didn't know what I was doing!

56:20.640 --> 56:23.240
I can't believe you kissed him!

56:24.440 --> 56:25.800
I didn't!

56:27.000 --> 56:28.520
Yeah, right!

56:28.760 --> 56:32.680
Jess, I know what I saw!
You knew he was off limits!

56:37.920 --> 56:41.840
Don't pretend to be so innocent.
You knew exactly how I felt about him!

56:42.040 --> 56:44.280
I didn't know
you were in love with him!

56:44.520 --> 56:48.680
You don't know the meaning of love!
You've really hurt me, Jess!

56:48.920 --> 56:52.160
That's all there is to it!
You've betrayed me!

56:53.960 --> 56:55.400
So that's it?

56:56.600 --> 56:58.920
Yeah, that's it. Bye!

57:03.680 --> 57:05.600
Goodbye, Mrs Paxton.

57:11.280 --> 57:12.760
What's going on?

57:14.400 --> 57:17.320
That is why she's been
so depressed lately!

57:17.560 --> 57:19.640
'Cause that Jess broke her heart!

57:19.880 --> 57:21.800
She's in love!

57:22.040 --> 57:23.960
With a girl!

57:24.200 --> 57:27.120
You're jumping
to all the wrong conclusions.

57:27.320 --> 57:28.680
But I heard her!

57:32.600 --> 57:37.240
No wonder she never looked twice
at that Kevin or brought any boys home!

57:41.080 --> 57:43.000
I tried to get her nice clothes.

57:43.240 --> 57:46.640
You know, we've had some lovely
prints in this summer..

57:46.880 --> 57:49.880
you know, in swimwear
and sarongs and that..

57:50.080 --> 57:53.720
but she never wants
to go shopping with me!

57:58.200 --> 58:01.680
It was terrible what they did
to that George Michael!

58:01.920 --> 58:06.400
Going on about him and his
private business in the papers like that!

58:06.640 --> 58:08.240
Oh, no!

58:11.120 --> 58:15.280
George Michael is still a superstar
and you still listen to Wham!.

58:21.440 --> 58:22.800
Do you fancy me, Tony?

58:23.000 --> 58:26.640
- I like you, yeah...
- Maybe we can go out, then, yeah?

58:26.840 --> 58:30.680
- Jess, what's going on?
- I think I need an Indian boyfriend.

58:30.880 --> 58:33.680
What's going on?
You're acting all weird.

58:33.880 --> 58:35.800
Sorry.

58:37.320 --> 58:39.240
You know my coach, yeah?

58:39.480 --> 58:40.920
Yeah.

58:42.280 --> 58:44.280
I nearly kissed him in Germany.

58:44.480 --> 58:47.640
Wow! And that's why you need
an Indian boyfriend?

58:47.840 --> 58:50.840
Well, Jules likes him, too,
and now she hates me.

58:51.080 --> 58:55.240
Look, Jess, you can't plan
who you fall for. It just happens.

58:55.480 --> 58:59.280
- Look at Posh and Becks.
- Well, Beckham's the best.

58:58.840 --> 59:01.960
- I really like Beckham, too.
- Of course you do.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.640
No one can cross a ball
or bend it like Beckham.

59:05.680 --> 59:07.040
No, Jess.

59:08.520 --> 59:10.440
I really like Beckham.

59:13.240 --> 59:15.400
What, you mean...?

59:19.160 --> 59:20.680
But you're Indian!

59:22.720 --> 59:24.640
I haven't told anyone.

59:26.120 --> 59:28.200
God, what's your mum gonna say?!

59:28.440 --> 59:30.760
My sister thinks you're mad about me!

59:31.000 --> 59:32.920
I am!

59:33.160 --> 59:35.080
I just don't want to marry you.

59:53.680 --> 59:56.600
What would those tossers
say if they knew?

59:56.800 --> 59:59.120
Jess, you're not going to tell anyone?

59:59.360 --> 01:00:03.200
'Course not. It's OK, Tony.
I mean, it's OK with me.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:07.640
Yeah, well, you fancying
your gora coach is OK with me.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.520
Besides...

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.240
he's quite fit!

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.840
Be back by three.
I can't keep 'em at the temple all day.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.280
I owe you big time!

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.000
- Go to bed.
- Bring me back some langar.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.280
We're going to pray to God
to give you both some sense, not get food!

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:59.400
{y:i}Red alert, red alert,
{y:i}it's a catastrophe

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.840
{y:i}But don't worry

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.480
{y:i}Don't panic

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.400
{y:i}Ain't nothing going on
{y:i}but history...

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:10.400
Honestly, Dad, I'll go and get it.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:15.720
{y:i}And the music
{y:i}keeps on playing on and on...

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.360
Jessie, it's only me.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:23.520
{y:i}And the music
{y:i}keeps on playing on and on...

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:26.080
Jessie? Jessie?

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.720
{y:i}Red alert, red alert,
{y:i}it's a catastrophe

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.200
{y:i}But don't worry...

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:33.040
They don't all look like lezzies,
do they?

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.320
Check out the boobs on the captain!

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.720
Jeez, man, they must get in the way!

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:43.000
She's lucky she ain't knocked
herself out with them!

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:46.160
Why can't you lot
just see them as footballers?

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.480
What?

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.520
To the side! To the side!

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.520
Come on! Move it!

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.520
Down one-nil. Come on!

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.440
Over here! Over here! Come on!

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.160
Go on, Jess!

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.600
Jules! Over! Jules!

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.120
Come on, Harriers!

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.320
Over here, Jules!

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.200
Go on, Jess!

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.080
Go on! Go on!

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.320
- What you playing at?
- Piss off, Paki!

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:40.920
- Go away! Number 7, come here.
- What's the matter with you, ref?

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:45.000
- Violent conduct towards a player.
- No! You can't do that!

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:49.080
You haven't seen any of it,
have ya?

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.080
It's out of order!

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.840
She is so hard!

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.920
Oh, man! Unlucky, Tony, mate!

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:04.280
What the hell's wrong
with you, Bhamra?

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:08.440
I don't ever want to see anything
like that from you ever again!

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.280
We're lucky they're not suspending
players from this tournament!

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:17.080
Excellent! We've got QPR in
the final. Three cheers - hip, hip!

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.720
- Hurray!
- Hip, hip!

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:20.360
- Hurray!
- Hip, hip!

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.160
- Hurray!
- Brilliant!

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.800
Why did you yell at me like that?
You knew the ref was out of order!

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.040
- You could have cost us the tournament.
- But it wasn't my fault!

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.240
- You didn't have to shout at me!
- I'm your coach.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:43.400
I have to treat you
the same as everyone else.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.400
Look, Jess, I saw it.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:53.560
She fouled you. She tugged your shirt.
You just over-reacted, that's all.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.600
That's not all! She called me a Paki,

01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:00.120
but I guess you wouldn't understand
what that feels like, would you?

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:03.320
Jess, I'm Irish.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.440
Of course I'd understand
what that feels like.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.080
Jesminder?

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.160
Oh, here he is.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:32.480
Tejinder's mother and father
have come to speak to us.

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.160
- Are you well?
- Thank you, yes.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.120
What's happening?

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.800
Teet's mum and dad
have come to eat dirt.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.800
Stupid cow! I don't know
who she thinks she is in that sari!

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:52.240
No mother can stand by
and watch her son go through this.

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:56.120
Well, our Pinky didn't come
out of her room for days.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.400
- She was crying.
- Our Teetu also.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.960
For days he ate and drank nothing!

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.600
All right. Thank you for coming.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.360
Thanks, Dad!

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.440
I'm getting married!

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:38.880
We'll give them a wedding party
they'll never forget!

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.440
Find out when the hall is free.

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:46.520
Jessie, get the old wedding cards.
We'll change the dates by hand.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.800
My name is Mohan Singh Bhamra.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.760
..and paneer tikka. We'll show them
we're not poor people!

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.760
Will Sunday the 25th be OK?

01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:59.800
- The 25th?
- There's a cancellation.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.720
No, we need more time.

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:06.320
Hold on, please. The 25th is
the only available date.

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.960
After that, nothing's available
for five months.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.720
I can't wait that long!

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:14.320
OK, let's do it
before something else goes wrong!

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.040
But, Dad, the 25th...

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.840
No, that was not for you.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.840
Oh, I'm so excited!

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.480
Your sister needs you.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:01.480
Mel said you wanted to see me.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.760
It's about Jess.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:07.680
I don't want to talk about Germany, Joe.

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:10.040
- Listen...
- Whatever! I'm over it!

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:14.280
I don't know why I was surprised!
You only think about yourself!

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:17.399
Everyone knows
you're leaving us next season!

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:20.160
- Nothing's been decided.
- Bollocks!

01:08:20.359 --> 01:08:24.840
You've already lied about the
American scout. He's not coming, is he?

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:29.479
You can't bear the idea of anyone
else making it because you can't!

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:31.680
He's coming to the final.

01:08:34.279 --> 01:08:35.760
What?

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:38.279
He saw you play in Germany.

01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:43.319
I thought...

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.439
Don't worry about it.

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:04.319
Jess!

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:17.399
We all missed you at training today.

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:21.000
Especially Joe.

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.399
He told me what happened
with your dad.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.960
He did?

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.479
Yeah.

01:09:32.279 --> 01:09:35.760
He's worried he's gotten you
into even more trouble.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.319
I'm really in the shit.

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.960
Dad hasn't talked to me since.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:44.279
He'll never let me go back
to join the team.

01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:46.520
But you can't miss the final.

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:50.160
Jess, there's gonna be
an American scout there.

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:53.920
I can't. It's the same day
as my sister's wedding.

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.040
Oh, shit!

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.360
Well, can't you get away for a bit?

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.920
- You don't understand.
- If you give up football now,

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:06.400
- what will you have to give up next?
- Don't rub it in!

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:10.480
You came here because you need me
if that bloody scout shows up.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.280
Look... I came here
'cause Joe was worried about you.

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:18.240
I'll tell him he's wasting his bloody time!

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:26.720
The teriyaki sauce is the goalkeeper.

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:29.720
The posh French mustard is the defender.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.760
- The salt is the attacker.
- The sea salt?

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.880
The sea salt is the attacker.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.320
Now, when the ball's played forward,

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.800
the sea salt has to be level
with the mustard. Hello, darling.

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:44.400
Now watch and concentrate.
Offside, onside.

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:48.120
- Offside, onside.
- What are you doing?

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.400
Well, if the mountain
won't come to Mohammed...

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.080
What?

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:57.360
I'm trying to teach
your mother the offside rule.

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:02.160
I've decided that I've got to take
an interest or I'm going to lose you.

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:06.240
This way we can all enjoy football
as a family.

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:10.600
Right. So, don't tell me.
The offside rule is...

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.720
..when...

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.880
..the French mustard...

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:20.160
has to be between the teriyaki
sauce and the sea salt.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.680
- She's got it.
- Got it!

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:25.600
- Wonderful!
- Have you read all these as well?

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.280
Yeah. Oh, and do you know what?

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:31.960
One of those England girls' players
is a maths teacher as well,

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.720
and she's happily married with a baby!

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.320
..A-level results...

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.640
..A-level results...

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:56.840
Hurry up, Mum!

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.280
Good.

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:16.400
Thank you! Thank you!

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.520
Jesminder Kaur Bhamra,

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:21.720
B.L.L.B,

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:24.880
you can become a fine,
top-class solicitor now.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:29.600
{y:i}Clean and serene

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:32.760
{y:i}Dream

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.080
{y:i}Dream the dream

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.400
{y:i}Clean

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.320
{y:i}And serene

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:45.600
{y:i}Dream

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.280
{y:i}Dream the dream

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.480
{y:i}Clean

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:56.160
{y:i}And serene

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.760
{y:i}Dream

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
{y:i}Dream the dream.

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:06.400
She's not coming, Joe.

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:09.400
- Her sister's wedding's on Sunday.
- Shit!

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.480
Guess I'm on my own, then.

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.160
You'll impress the scout. No worries.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:17.800
- How was she?
- A right stroppy cow, actually.

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.480
She's really pissed off she can't make it

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.120
and she doesn't know what to do.

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:42.400
Go on! Kick the ball, kick the ball!

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:46.240
Three players behind you, hunting you!

01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:58.280
Yes?

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:02.520
I'm sorry to bother you like this.

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:06.080
- I don'have anything to say to you.
- I appreciate it

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:09.320
and I won't keep you long,
but I wanted you to know

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.320
that a scout's coming to our match tomorrow.

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.400
So?

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:20.240
So, it's the opportunity of a lifetime
for Jess. Please, Mr Bhamra,

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:23.520
- don't let her talent go to waste.
- Thank you.

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.880
What did he say, Dad?

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:36.240
Don't play with your future, putar.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:48.280
Wait!

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.880
I'm sorry about the final.

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.200
No, I'm sorry, Jess.

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.400
I got my results.
I'm starting university soon.

01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:59.880
I won't have time to train and stuff.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:04.320
Now that's a shame. I could have
seen you play for England some day.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:11.320
- Jules still has a shot.
- She told me about the scout.

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:15.520
- Sorry I'm letting her down.
- That scout's coming for you, too.

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:18.760
- He's interested in both of you.
- Me?!

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.080
Why are you doing this to me, Joe?

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:29.680
Every time I talk myself out of it,
you make it sound so easy.

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:33.760
I guess I don't want to give up on you.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:42.480
So, are you promised
to one of those blokes in there?

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:46.320
Don't be silly!
I'm not promised to anyone.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:51.440
You're lucky...to have a family
that cares that much about you.

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:56.200
I can understand
you don't want to mess with it.

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.800
Joe...

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.440
And I don't fancy being busted by
your dad again. You'd better get back.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:09.680
I hope all goes well for you tomorrow,
and good luck with your studies.

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.600
Come and see us some time.

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.680
Let's hope she fits
in the car with that hat on.

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:32.480
We're going to a football match
not Ascot! You look lovely.

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.040
Beautiful...

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.200
Eyes down! Look sad!

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.960
Don't smile! Indian brides never smile.

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.080
You'll ruin the bloody video!

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.720
She looks like a jar
of bloody Ragu, innit?

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:50.960
Where's the flippin' Rolls?
Can't anything happen without me?!

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.520
{y:i}One, two, three, four...

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:17.800
{y:i}You gave me something like loving

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.480
{y:i}And took me in so soon

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:22.000
{y:i}You took my feelings from nothing

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.480
{y:i}Came back at noon

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:26.640
{y:i}Just meet me, I'm ready

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.720
{y:i}To show myself to you

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:32.600
{y:i}So if I lose my patience

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:34.920
{y:i}You must try to understand

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:37.400
{y:i}Try to understand

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:40.840
{y:i}If I lose my patience

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:44.160
{y:i}Oh, yeah

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:46.600
{y:i}'Cause you make me feel

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:48.760
{y:i}Yeah, yeah

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.840
{y:i}'Cause you make me feel wild
{y:i}(yeah, yeah)

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:56.400
{y:i}You touch my inner smile

01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:58.120
{y:i}Yeah, yeah

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:01.440
{y:i}You got me in the mood
{y:i}(yeah, yeah)

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:06.840
{y:i}So come on, make your rule
{y:i}and free me...

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.440
What are you doing?!

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:11.080
We'll make the second half if we go now.

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:15.040
My mum and dad will go spare!
I've got to put them first today.

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:19.000
- They won't even notice.
- I can't! Look how happy they are.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:21.160
I don't want to ruin it for them.

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.000
- Ruin what?
- Nothing.

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:26.040
It's the final of the football tournament.

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:29.800
- We'll drive there. It won't take long.
- Stop it, Tony.

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:33.880
It doesn't matter. I don't want
to spoil the day for you and Mum.

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:37.520
Pinky is so happy and you look
as if you're at my funeral.

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.240
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:45.240
If this means I'll see you smiling on your
sister's wedding day, then go now,

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:49.080
but when you come back, I want
to see you happy on the video.

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.200
Play well and make us proud.

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.040
Joe!

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:48.160
What's happening?

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:51.920
Start warming up.
We're one-nil down, half an hour to go.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.400
Come on, ref!

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:15.160
Ref!

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.720
Form a wall! Form a wall!

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:39.200
Well done!

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:45.040
Have any of you seen Jesminder?

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:46.760
Jesminder!

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:49.160
Jesminder?

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.080
Go on, Jules!

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:15.800
One-all!

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:34.800
Where does this bit go?
You're doing it wrong. Round that way.

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:37.520
Tuck it in. Tuck it in.

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:40.400
You've got your shorts on.

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.200
Where does that bit go?

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:43.800
Lift your leg up.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.640
- Paxton, Bhamra, are you decent?
- Yes!

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.360
Oh, is that the coach?

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:55.600
- Who's that?
- Dunno. He looks important.

01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:58.000
- Yeah.
- I haven't seen him before.

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:04.640
- Look how happy she is.
- I know.

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:14.680
I can't believe it! It was amazing!
My eyes just glazed over!

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:18.920
What a game for him to see!
It's incredible! Santa Clara!

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:22.000
It's in California!
It's one of the top teams!

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:26.320
He said he'd give us a full
scholarship so you'll pay nothing!

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:31.280
Oh, it's so amazing! Me and Jess
there together, the pair of us!

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.720
Come on, Paula.

01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:11.560
I'm not blaming you but it is the football.

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:13.200
It is!

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:18.800
Come on, darling. Come on.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.240
I'm off, then!

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:27.720
Sweetheart, where are you going
in your best trousers?

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.880
- Out.
- Where? Who with?

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.600
I'm meeting Jess at her
sister's wedding to celebrate.

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:39.160
- Wait! I'll take you.
- Oh, thanks, Mum!

01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:18.920
My God, it's so colourful.
Everyone looks brilliant! Look at the car!

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:37.000
- How are you?
- You look gorgeous!

01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:39.000
- Mum...
- Hello, Mrs Paxton.

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:41.120
How could you be such a hypocrite?

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:44.280
How could you be all respectful here
with your lot

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:48.240
when you've been kissing
my daughter in broad daylight?!

01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:49.920
Hmm?

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:00.840
Get your lesbian feet out of my shoes!

01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:06.600
Lesbian? Her birthday's in March.
I thought she was a Pisces.

01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:09.680
She no Lebanese. She Punjabi!

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:12.120
Do you mind? This is my wedding!

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:15.200
- Sorry.
- How could you do this, sweetheart?

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:17.840
What is wrong with you?!

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:24.760
What's that gora
going on about you being a lezbo?

01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:28.400
- I thought you fancied your coach!
- I don't know what she was saying!

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:32.800
Don't you want all of this? This is
the best day of your life, innit?

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:37.440
I want more than this. They've offered
us a scholarship to go to America.

01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:41.560
Dad won't let you live abroad
without getting married first.

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:46.960
- What were you thinking?!
- I saw you with my own eyes!

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:51.040
You were kissing after your match!
I'm not stupid, you know!

01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:54.000
And anyway, look at the clothes you wear!

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:57.600
Mother, just because
I wear trackies and play sport

01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:59.760
does not make me a lesbian!

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:07.440
Me and Jess were fighting because
we both fancied our coach - Joe!

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:14.680
- What, a man, Joe?
- Yeah, as in male - Joe!

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:16.720
Joe, our coach! Joe, man, Joe!

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:23.240
Anyway,
being a lesbian is not that big a deal.

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:26.040
Oh, no, sweetheart, of course it isn't.

01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:29.760
No! I mean, I've got nothing against it.

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:34.440
I was cheering for Martina Navratilova
as much as the next person.

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:38.360
What was that English woman saying?

01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:43.480
- Why was she talking about kissing?
- She got confused like Teetu's parents.

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:46.720
It's so hard when young girls
have such short hair.

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:49.200
Maybe we were making too much noise.

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:53.840
English people are always complaining
when we're having functions.

01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:56.800
Why did she take Jesminder's shoes?

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:05.720
How am I going to tell 'em, Tony?

01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:09.920
I'll have to now or I'll end up a solicitor,
bored out of my mind.

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:17.120
Come with me.

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:24.840
Mum, Uncle, Auntie...

01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:28.680
We've got something we want to tell you.

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:32.800
Why is he holding her hand?

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.640
We've been good friends for a long time now.

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:38.360
We'd like to ask for your blessings.

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:43.040
We'd like to get engaged.

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:50.840
But there's one condition -
Jesminder goes to college first,

01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:52.800
anywhere that she wants.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.600
Of course, putar!

01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:01.040
Well, we have relatives all the way
in Glasgow, in Portsmouth...

01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:02.880
Mum, Dad...

01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:04.520
Tony's lying.

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:06.880
We're not getting married.

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:12.160
Tony only said that to help me,
but I'm not lying any more.

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:16.960
I played in the final today, and we won!

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:20.600
- When?
- I wasn't going to go but Dad let me.

01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:24.120
And it was brilliant.

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:27.400
I played the best ever!

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:32.400
And I was happy because I wasn't
sneaking off and lying to you!

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:36.000
I didn't ask to be good at football.

01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:38.240
Guru Nanak must have blessed me.

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.920
There was a scout from America there today,

01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:46.520
and he's offered me a place at a top university

01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:51.840
with a free scholarship and a chance
to play football professionally,

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:56.560
and I really want to go,
and if I can't tell you what I want now,

01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:58.640
then I'll never be happy, whatever I do.

01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:05.560
You let her leave her sister's wedding
to go to a football match?!

01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:08.840
Maybe you could handle
her long face, I could not.

01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:11.080
I didn't have the heart to stop her.

01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:14.960
And that's why she's ready to go
all the way to America now!

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:19.480
She's dead, man!

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:22.560
It's all right, Mum, just leave it.

01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:28.520
When those bloody English cricket players

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:31.920
threw me out of their club like a dog...

01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:35.200
..I never complained.

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:40.160
On the contrary, I vowed
that I will never play again.

01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:41.720
Who suffered?

01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:43.400
Me.

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.520
But I don't want Jessie to suffer.

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:54.560
I don't want her to make the same
mistakes that her father made

01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:57.240
of accepting life, accepting situations.

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:01.840
I want her to fight.

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:06.200
And I want her to win...

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:11.000
..because I've seen her play.
She is brilliant!

01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:18.720
I don't think anybody
has the right of stopping her.

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:28.800
Two daughters made happy in one day.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.160
What else can a father ask for?

01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:36.160
At least I've taught her full Indian dinner.
The rest is up to God.

01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:44.720
Joe!

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:47.800
I'm going!

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.760
They said I could go!

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:00.840
Sorry. I forgot.

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:04.280
It's OK now. I'm not your coach any more.

01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:07.400
We can do what we want.

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.600
- Joe...
- Your dad's not here, is he?

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:16.840
I'm sorry, Joe. I can't.

01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:25.160
I thought you wanted...

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:32.840
Letting me go is a really big step
for my mum and dad.

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:38.480
I don't know how they'd survive
if I told them about you, too.

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:55.880
I guess there's not much point
with you going to America anyway, is there?

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:36.680
- It's not perfume, is it?
- No. It's not what you think.

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:39.920
It was your mum's idea.

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:46.320
Oh! Thank you so much!

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:51.280
Keep this by your bed. Phone Papu Uncle
in Canada as soon as you land.

01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:53.840
At least there's some family close by.

01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:57.640
It's getting really late.
You'd better board the plane.

01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:05.400
Jess!

01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:09.960
Don't worry. That's her coach.

01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:14.440
What are you doing here?

01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:18.160
They offered me the job,
coaching the men's side.

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:21.720
- No more pulling pints.
- That's great, Joe!

01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:23.560
I turned them down.

01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:27.440
- Why did you...?
- I'm going to coach the girls' side.

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:29.880
They want us to turn pro next year.

01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:33.360
Can't keep losing my best players
to the Yanks, can I?

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:36.760
That's brilliant!
You should tell your dad, you know.

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:38.960
I already did.

01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:41.080
Are we doing the right thing?

01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:44.440
Whatever God has written for her
will happen.

01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:48.240
- Maybe I'll sign you if I can afford you!
- Yeah, you wish!

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.760
Look...

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.720
- I can't let you go without knowing.
- What?

01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:01.440
That even with the distance
and the concerns of your family,

01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:03.800
we might still have something.

01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:06.520
What do you think?

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.760
Oh, my God, it's Beckham! It's a sign!

01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.280
Jess, it's Becks!

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:32.360
{y:i}'Cause you make me feel

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:36.560
{y:i}(Yeah, yeah)
{y:i}'Cause you make me feel...

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:45.200
I'm back at Christmas.
We'll tackle my mum and dad then.

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:51.240
I'd better go.

01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:01.000
- Take care of yourself.
- See ya, mate.

01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:03.280
- Have a good time.
- Yeah, and you.

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:07.240
Come on, you two,
you're gonna miss this plane. Ticket. Go!

01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:08.880
See you later.

01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:13.680
Come on!

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:16.000
Bye, sweetheart!

01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:21.280
{y:i}Just move on up...

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:22.960
Oh, thank you.

01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:25.600
Hello. Nice to meet you.

01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:41.600
Come on. Let's have a look.

01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:44.400
Sweatshirts!

01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:46.320
Look at that!

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:48.040
{y:i}Just move on up!

01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:51.320
{y:i}Move on up!

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:54.720
{y:i}Move on up...

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:01.560
{y:i}Well, move on up!

01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:04.760
{y:i}Move on up!

01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:16.640
Yes!

01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:18.760
No, no, no.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.440
Oh, yes, yes!

01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:56.600
{y:i}Feeling hot, hot, hot!

01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:03.880
{y:i}Feeling hot, hot, hot!

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:48.240
{y:i}Feeling hot, hot, hot!

01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:52.960
{y:i}- How ya feeling?
{y:i}- Hot, hot, hot!

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:54.800
{y:i}- How ya feeling?
{y:i}- Hot, hot, hot!

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.600
{y:i}- How ya feeling?
{y:i}- Hot, hot, hot!

01:42:56.840 --> 01:42:59.080
{y:i}- How ya feeling?
{y:i}- Hot, hot, hot!

01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:05.200
I've totally forgotten the line!

01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:12.720
{y:i}Feeling hot, hot, hot!

01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:45.280
{y:i}Feeling hot, hot, hot!

01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:47.160
{y:i}Feeling hot, hot, hot!

01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:49.000
{y:i}Feeling hot, hot, hot...
