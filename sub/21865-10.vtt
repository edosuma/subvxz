Yeah, yeah, we have that.
Mm‐hmm, sure.

19:23.362 --> 19:24.563
MAN:
Guess what, players.

19:24.563 --> 19:29.268
And Marion's coming on stage
in 15 minutes.

19:29.268 --> 19:32.238
Hey, can you tell me
where Crystal is?
In the back.

19:32.238 --> 19:34.507
♪ ♪

19:40.346 --> 19:43.149
MAN:
What the hell were you
doing talking to that guy?

19:43.149 --> 19:45.584
He just wanted
a dance.
He's a cop!

19:45.584 --> 19:49.221
CRYSTAL:
I didn't say anything
to him, I swear!

19:49.221 --> 19:50.322
Hi!

19:50.322 --> 19:52.258
Uh, are you guys almost done

19:52.258 --> 19:54.260
with this pretty lady in here?
Because, look,

19:54.260 --> 19:57.163
I've been wanting to dance
with her all night...

19:57.163 --> 20:00.266
(gun cocks)
She doesn't want to dance.

20:02.601 --> 20:05.204
What does that mean?
Do you want to dance?

20:06.605 --> 20:08.240
You want to dance
with me there, big...?

20:08.240 --> 20:10.576
(gunshots, grunting)

20:10.576 --> 20:12.611
Ben, looks, we got
a situation here.
What's going on?

20:12.611 --> 20:14.346
Here. You put this on.

20:14.346 --> 20:15.614
And you're gonna get down there.

20:15.614 --> 20:17.183
Here's a little hat.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.617
And you're gonna
stay there. Okay?

20:18.617 --> 20:20.619
Until I come back.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.425
Don't move!
(gasps)

20:26.425 --> 20:27.560
Nobody moves!

20:27.560 --> 20:29.929
Well, nobody move?

20:29.929 --> 20:32.164
That's a terrible motto, buddy,

20:32.164 --> 20:34.333
especially
for a strip club.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.642

20:45.377 --> 20:47.113

20:54.386 --> 20:56.555

20:56.555 --> 20:59.391
(groans softly)
Stay there.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.598
Told you all the fun was inside.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.601
Is it safe?

21:08.601 --> 21:11.370
(sirens wailing)

21:11.370 --> 21:13.439
McNeile?!

21:13.439 --> 21:15.608
I'm just here for the ribs.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.610
Mm, mm, mm.

21:23.041 --> 21:24.075
Anyone who says this happened

21:24.075 --> 21:26.845
because Diego was involved
in drugs is a liar.

21:26.845 --> 21:29.414
He didn't touch them,
he refused to be around 'em.

21:29.414 --> 21:31.283
But it's hard to avoid
when you're spending a lot

21:31.283 --> 21:33.985
of time in a strip
club, no offense.

21:33.985 --> 21:36.021
He wasn't a customer.

21:36.021 --> 21:39.090
He... he only came in
to make deliveries for his boss.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.859
His boss at the Harold Club?

21:40.859 --> 21:43.061
Yeah, one of those rich
white dudes.

21:43.061 --> 21:45.263
Um, like, Grant something?

21:45.263 --> 21:47.165
Davenport. Grant Davenport.

21:47.165 --> 21:49.868
Yup, that's him.
He's, um, in business

21:49.868 --> 21:51.970
with one of the owners
of The South Pole.

21:51.970 --> 21:55.173
Diego ran documents
and cash and whatever else

21:55.173 --> 21:58.143
back and forth until something
blew up a couple days ago.

21:58.143 --> 21:59.244
They had a falling out?

21:59.244 --> 22:01.246
No, one of his trucks‐‐
it blew up.

22:01.246 --> 22:02.914
Literally.

22:02.914 --> 22:05.116
And... you know,

22:05.116 --> 22:07.219
Diego wouldn't
tell me anything.

22:07.219 --> 22:10.055
But, um...

22:10.055 --> 22:11.022
he was scared.

22:11.022 --> 22:14.092
Rumor had it, those guys
were Aryan Fraternity.

22:14.092 --> 22:16.862
You think he had him killed
to shut him up?

22:19.030 --> 22:20.732
Mm‐hmm.

22:23.068 --> 22:25.036
Diego was just, um...

22:26.838 --> 22:28.940
...he was just a good soul.

22:30.275 --> 22:31.276
(elevator bell dings)

22:31.276 --> 22:32.911
RIGGS:
Oh, here she comes.

22:32.911 --> 22:35.580
Okay. Hey, Mom!
(clears throat)

22:35.580 --> 22:38.283
Uh, am I in the right place?
I'm looking for the "adult"

22:38.283 --> 22:40.018
who took an eight‐year‐old
to a strip club

22:40.018 --> 22:41.386
while he was supposed
to be babysitting.

22:41.386 --> 22:45.223
Uh, it was more
of a performance space,

22:45.223 --> 22:46.825
you know?

22:46.825 --> 22:47.826
Right?

22:47.826 --> 22:49.194
Yeah, good job.
Hey, uh, Nelson.

22:49.194 --> 22:52.964
Hey, would you, uh, take Ben
to grab a snack? Sugar‐free.

22:52.964 --> 22:55.967
So you gave him
a bunch of junk food,

22:55.967 --> 22:57.269
kept him up all night,

22:57.269 --> 23:00.205
and you brought him
to a gunfight at...

23:00.205 --> 23:01.840
Uh, The South Pole.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.108
Mmm.
It's a play on words.

23:03.108 --> 23:04.376
Oh. Right. Right, right.

23:04.376 --> 23:05.911
Is that everything?

23:05.911 --> 23:07.345
Uh, yeah, that's everything.
Oh, and I told him

23:07.345 --> 23:08.813
about Jake.
(clears throat)

23:08.813 --> 23:10.215
Jake came up.
Mm‐hmm.

23:10.215 --> 23:11.883
In‐in what context?

23:11.883 --> 23:14.185
Um... you know, like, my dad.

23:14.185 --> 23:15.887
That whole context.

23:17.255 --> 23:19.891
You told my son
about how his dad

23:19.891 --> 23:21.927
shot your father?

23:21.927 --> 23:23.562
Listen... I know what
you're thinking.

23:23.562 --> 23:25.363
That an eight‐year...
my eight‐year‐old,

23:25.363 --> 23:26.431
is too young to hear that?

23:26.431 --> 23:29.134
That I have thought long
and hard about how and when

23:29.134 --> 23:30.268
I would ever tell him?

23:30.268 --> 23:31.970
What gives you the right
to do that?

23:31.970 --> 23:33.271
Molly, I just
wanted him to know.

23:33.271 --> 23:36.274
What, what‐‐
that his dad's a hero?

23:37.943 --> 23:39.277
He was a hero to me.

23:42.881 --> 23:45.050
I like being with you, Riggs.

23:45.050 --> 23:47.085
It makes me happy.

23:47.085 --> 23:49.087
But that kid in the other room

23:49.087 --> 23:50.956
is my whole world.

23:50.956 --> 23:53.058
So if you can't
get past this, I...

23:57.329 --> 23:59.331
We're doing
Christmas Eve dinner.

23:59.331 --> 24:00.899
I want you there.

24:00.899 --> 24:03.268
But if you're gonna
bring Jake, don't come.

24:08.106 --> 24:10.709
Hey, bud,
let's go.

24:13.244 --> 24:15.113
We're dealing with it.

24:15.113 --> 24:19.017
They got the stripper,
but we ID'd the cops.

24:19.017 --> 24:20.852
A Detective Murtaugh.

24:20.852 --> 24:23.121
Get this‐‐

24:23.121 --> 24:25.824
a Detective Martin Riggs.

24:27.859 --> 24:30.128
(piano playing "We Wish You
a Merry Christmas")

24:30.128 --> 24:32.263
(Murtaugh whistles along)

24:33.198 --> 24:34.899
(snapping fingers)

24:36.134 --> 24:37.369
Detectives.

24:37.369 --> 24:39.304
What a treat.

24:40.905 --> 24:43.141
Help yourself to some eggnog.

24:43.141 --> 24:44.042
I thought this was
a made‐up drink.

24:44.042 --> 24:45.377
Like, I'd seen it on TV,
but I didn't know

24:45.377 --> 24:46.411
it was, like,
a real thing.

24:46.411 --> 24:47.946
It's delicious.

24:47.946 --> 24:50.148
(chuckles)
Uh, these gentlemen were, uh...

24:50.148 --> 24:51.316
they were just...
We were just

24:51.316 --> 24:54.185
expressing our condolences
for the truck that blew up.

24:54.185 --> 24:56.388
You know, the one you were
smuggling the meth in,

24:56.388 --> 25:00.158
with the Aryan Fraternity?
(laughs)

25:00.158 --> 25:02.160
A little holiday joke

25:02.160 --> 25:03.862
from the mayor, folks.

25:03.862 --> 25:05.163
(chuckles)

25:05.163 --> 25:07.132
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

25:07.132 --> 25:08.900
Can I have a word
with you?

25:12.370 --> 25:14.239
So, uh...
(clears throat)

25:14.239 --> 25:17.342
I don't, uh, want any trouble,
and I'm sure you don't either.

25:17.342 --> 25:19.344
How do we get you to go away?

25:19.344 --> 25:21.112
Let's come to terms.

25:21.112 --> 25:23.114
Uh... Are...

25:23.114 --> 25:25.116
Is‐is he offering
us a bribe?

25:25.116 --> 25:26.885
Hmm, I think so.

25:26.885 --> 25:28.353
Okay. Uh...

25:28.353 --> 25:30.355
$12 should do it.

25:30.355 --> 25:32.023
And here's how
we want it:

25:32.023 --> 25:34.325
a five,
four singles,

25:34.325 --> 25:37.729
and quarters for parking.

25:38.930 --> 25:40.565
You've got your foot
in a hornet's nest.

25:40.565 --> 25:42.133
If you were smart...

25:42.133 --> 25:44.035
Oh, we're not.
Just ask anyone.

25:44.035 --> 25:47.272
We already have you
for meth trafficking, murder,

25:47.272 --> 25:49.007
and we're just
getting started.

25:49.007 --> 25:51.109
No, you have the word
of a stripper

25:51.109 --> 25:52.310
and her deadbeat boyfriend.

25:52.310 --> 25:54.379
A good kid you killed

25:54.379 --> 25:55.880
and pinned on someone else.

25:55.880 --> 25:58.316
Diego trusted you.
Hey, you know what, Rog?

25:58.316 --> 26:01.086
He's right.

26:01.086 --> 26:02.220
We really don't
have it all.

26:02.220 --> 26:05.890
I think that we should
hang out here,

26:05.890 --> 26:07.759
walk around the club,

26:07.759 --> 26:10.161
and talk to everyone,
individually,

26:10.161 --> 26:11.830
about Grant.
(chuckles)

26:11.830 --> 26:13.965
Right? I might even
apply for membership.

26:13.965 --> 26:16.267
(laughs)
Not... not likely
to go your way.

26:16.267 --> 26:18.236
Mmm.
Tough vetting process.

26:18.236 --> 26:21.206
Any skeletons
in your closet,

26:21.206 --> 26:23.374
we'll find them.
Friends, family.

26:23.374 --> 26:25.310
Ah, sweet, I‐I don't
have much of either.

26:25.310 --> 26:28.847
Well, now, you know
that's not true.

26:28.847 --> 26:30.381
Your family.

26:30.381 --> 26:33.118
You write 'em off,
move away‐‐

26:33.118 --> 26:36.988
they're still yours.

26:36.988 --> 26:40.358

Hey, you know what, Riggs,

26:42.927 --> 26:44.095
it's okay.

26:44.095 --> 26:46.831
I'll get in,
and then <i>you</i> will be my guest.

26:55.874 --> 26:57.876
fares better...

26:57.876 --> 26:59.244

27:03.214 --> 27:05.350
You know, uh, I changed my mind.

27:05.350 --> 27:07.986
I think I will try the eggnog.

27:07.986 --> 27:09.788
Yup.

Hmm?

about your family.

27:51.362 --> 27:53.932
I told you about my dad, right?

27:53.932 --> 27:56.034
Yeah, you told me
he was a son of a bitch.

27:56.034 --> 27:58.403
Well, he was a son of a bitch

27:58.403 --> 28:01.406

Yeah.
