WEBVTT

00:00.556 --> 00:01.797
Ben: Okay, Emma...

00:01.897 --> 00:03.631
we were officially late 20 minutes ago,

00:03.666 --> 00:05.483
so if we could skip today's game

00:05.518 --> 00:07.535
of socks on, socks off,
that would be great.

00:09.438 --> 00:11.489
Oh, and remember, we
have yet another exciting

00:11.524 --> 00:12.841
preschool interview after daycare.

00:12.892 --> 00:14.859
If they ask you what you consider

00:14.894 --> 00:17.812
to be your greatest weakness,
smile and look confident.

00:17.847 --> 00:20.582
It's not an answer,
but it confuses people.

00:23.652 --> 00:25.553
I'm not gonna lie,
kind of looking forward

00:25.604 --> 00:27.655
to you being someone else's
problem for the next five hours.

00:27.706 --> 00:29.457
Momma.

00:29.492 --> 00:31.559
(chuckles) Thankfully, she's
not our problem anymore.

00:31.561 --> 00:32.627
Momma.

00:32.661 --> 00:34.462
No, sweetheart.
Not your...

00:34.513 --> 00:35.864
- (music plays from TV)
- Hey, that really is your Momma.

00:39.935 --> 00:41.736
<i>Freeze, dirtbag!</i>

00:41.787 --> 00:43.772
<i>Your worst nightmare is here.</i>

00:46.792 --> 00:49.744
She got the "nightmare" part right.

00:49.779 --> 00:50.779
I'm so late. Okay.

00:50.781 --> 00:51.830
All right, let's go.

00:51.864 --> 00:53.832
Hey, let's do that thing
that we did last week

00:53.866 --> 00:56.668
with the cops and get
an escort again. Yeah.

00:56.702 --> 00:58.837

01:14.854 --> 01:18.740
<i>Bar on B is officially my bitch!</i>

01:19.775 --> 01:21.659
Hey, Mom? Remember when I said,

01:21.694 --> 01:22.911
"Don't get carried away.

01:22.945 --> 01:24.746
"I just need you to fill in
for Sam while she's out of town

01:24.780 --> 01:25.747
for a few days"?

01:25.781 --> 01:26.781
<i>What's your point?</i>

01:26.783 --> 01:29.667
This is carried away.

01:29.702 --> 01:30.835
Ugh, well I don't even know

01:30.870 --> 01:32.787
why you hired her in the first place.

01:32.838 --> 01:35.790
If you're gonna hire just
any old, unqualified floozy,

01:35.841 --> 01:37.792
you should have hired me.

01:37.794 --> 01:39.627
Sam's doing just fine.

01:39.678 --> 01:40.795
Oh. Oh, really?

01:40.797 --> 01:43.765
Because this place
looks pretty dead to me.

01:43.799 --> 01:44.799
We're not open yet.

01:44.850 --> 01:47.802
Look, honey, I know that
you think business is fine,

01:47.804 --> 01:49.854
but I'm here to tell you,
it could be even better.

01:49.889 --> 01:52.807
Look, let me help you. Please?

01:52.809 --> 01:54.776
<i>You won't recognize this
place when I'm done with it.</i>

01:54.810 --> 01:56.811
Oh, my God. Mom, no.

01:58.814 --> 02:00.698
<i>Nice try.</i>

02:00.733 --> 02:01.816
<i>You put that away right now.</i>

02:01.818 --> 02:03.618
<i>You put it away.</i>

02:03.652 --> 02:04.702
<i>I don't want to see that again.</i>

02:06.655 --> 02:07.822
- (beep)
- And blog posted.

02:07.824 --> 02:09.657
Take that, Mary Hart.

02:09.658 --> 02:11.659
You fire the Tucker,
you're gonna get Tuckinated!

02:13.662 --> 02:17.582
How courageous of you to
finally confront Mary Hart

02:17.633 --> 02:18.716
Behind a laptop.

02:18.751 --> 02:20.635
Using a fake name.

02:21.720 --> 02:22.720
I don't know, Tuck.

02:22.755 --> 02:24.639
I think you're playing with fire.

02:24.673 --> 02:25.673
I mean, really,

02:25.675 --> 02:27.592
Mary Hart might set you on fire.

02:28.677 --> 02:29.677
Or sue you.

02:29.728 --> 02:30.845
Man, she can't sue me.

02:30.847 --> 02:32.680
I didn't even use her real name.

02:34.650 --> 02:35.700
Hey, is that Angela?

02:35.734 --> 02:36.668
Hey, Ben.

02:38.571 --> 02:39.721
- (clattering)
- Angela! Hi.

02:39.772 --> 02:41.706
What are you... what are you doing here?

02:41.740 --> 02:44.692
Did someone forget to
lock the gates of hell?

02:44.727 --> 02:46.494
Ben, please.

02:46.496 --> 02:48.413
I know I've made some mistakes,

02:48.464 --> 02:50.515
but can I please just see Emma?

02:50.566 --> 02:52.417
- Sure.
- Really?

02:52.468 --> 02:53.801
Yeah.

02:53.852 --> 02:54.903
Here she is.

02:54.937 --> 02:56.421
(sighs)

02:56.455 --> 02:57.889
Walking, talking.

02:57.940 --> 02:59.824
It's amazing how much they grow
when you're busy abandoning them.

02:59.858 --> 03:02.694
Well, can I at least help with expenses?

03:02.728 --> 03:04.579
I'm making really good money now.

03:04.581 --> 03:05.747
I have a hit TV show.

03:05.781 --> 03:07.649
I've seen it. Let's
not get carried away.

03:09.702 --> 03:11.519
We don't need your help.

03:11.521 --> 03:12.520
I own a bar.

03:12.554 --> 03:14.389
It looks pretty dead in here to me.

03:14.440 --> 03:15.473
We're not open yet!

03:22.848 --> 03:24.449
Mary Hart's out to get me.

03:24.483 --> 03:26.451
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm sure, okay?

03:26.502 --> 03:27.869
Last night, my bathrobe went missing

03:27.871 --> 03:30.805
and now the mail's been torn in half.

03:30.807 --> 03:31.823
So?

03:31.857 --> 03:32.840
The mailman hates you

03:32.875 --> 03:34.676
and you never wash your bathrobe,

03:34.678 --> 03:35.843
so it probably killed itself.

03:35.878 --> 03:38.663
Um, I'm clean when I put it on,

03:38.697 --> 03:39.731
so it don't need to be washed.

03:41.583 --> 03:43.551
Dude, Mary's trying
to send me a message.

03:43.585 --> 03:45.603
- (knocking)
- Oh, my God! She's gonna kill me!

03:47.623 --> 03:49.440
Dude, calm down.

03:49.475 --> 03:51.409
If Mary really were here to kill you,

03:51.443 --> 03:52.493
she probably wouldn't knock.

03:55.914 --> 03:57.465
Um...

03:57.516 --> 03:58.466
What is it, man?

03:58.517 --> 03:59.901
Hey, is it a head?

03:59.935 --> 04:01.369
Come on! It's a head, right?

04:01.371 --> 04:03.671
I know it's a head! It's always a head!

04:03.673 --> 04:04.822
Nope, not a head.

04:04.857 --> 04:06.724
And I don't know if
she's out to kill you,

04:06.759 --> 04:09.560
but she definitely had
it in for your robe.

04:13.649 --> 04:15.583
We had such good times together.

04:17.653 --> 04:19.637
God, I don't know why I'm so nervous.

04:19.672 --> 04:22.473
It's not like they're
deciding if they like me.

04:22.508 --> 04:24.859
Wait, are they deciding if they like me?

04:24.861 --> 04:27.378
Relax, all right? It's just preschool.

04:27.429 --> 04:30.398
I mean, it doesn't define
Emma's future or anything.

04:30.449 --> 04:31.799
- Did you go to preschool?
- Oh, my God. Yes.

04:31.834 --> 04:33.768
Best in the state. I mean,
why do you think I'm a lawyer?

04:34.903 --> 04:36.421
I am so sorry.

04:36.455 --> 04:38.806
Just relax, okay?

04:38.857 --> 04:41.843
- Well, hello there.
- Ben and Riley: Hi.

04:41.877 --> 04:43.728
Hi, I'm Riley,

04:43.762 --> 04:45.663
this little angel's Godmother.

04:45.698 --> 04:47.548
Just another member of Team Emma.

04:47.599 --> 04:49.550
We have T-shirts.

04:49.585 --> 04:51.619
(chuckles) So where do we
sign and when do we start?

04:51.621 --> 04:54.439
Well, aren't you both darling?

04:54.473 --> 04:56.591
But I'm so, so, so sorry to tell you,

04:56.593 --> 04:59.844
Emma didn't pass the entrance exam.

05:02.398 --> 05:03.748
Entrance exam?

05:03.782 --> 05:06.350
She can't even say "entrance exam."

05:06.402 --> 05:07.785
She's two.

05:07.836 --> 05:10.688
Regardless, she failed.

05:11.740 --> 05:13.758
Emma's exceptionally headstrong

05:13.792 --> 05:16.494
and not a real fan of authority.

05:16.545 --> 05:19.480
She also doesn't like to share,
and while I can't prove it,

05:19.515 --> 05:21.616
I'm quite certain she threw
a ball at the back of my head

05:21.650 --> 05:24.368
when I turned around.

05:24.420 --> 05:26.454
So, it was lovely to meet you,

05:26.456 --> 05:27.839
but I'm late for another meeting.

05:30.442 --> 05:32.427
- Oh, God. No!
- No! Riley just let me...

05:33.495 --> 05:34.445
Ben: What am I gonna do?

05:34.480 --> 05:36.748
We're out of preschools
and you know why?

05:36.799 --> 05:38.399
She's exactly like me.

05:38.434 --> 05:40.368
I'm not ready to raise a me.

05:40.419 --> 05:41.702
It was hard enough to grow up a me.

05:41.754 --> 05:42.770
Okay, stop, all right?

05:42.805 --> 05:44.589
We will figure something out.

05:44.623 --> 05:45.740
You're not a total failure. Look.

05:45.791 --> 05:48.576
You own a lovely business.

05:48.610 --> 05:49.610
Oh!

05:50.746 --> 05:52.463
Bonnie: Hey, hey!

05:52.498 --> 05:55.450
Now that we know what she's
got, we can turn her down a bit.

05:55.501 --> 05:57.452
What the hell is going on?

05:57.486 --> 05:58.519
Well...

05:58.570 --> 06:00.488
I was gonna surprise you!

06:00.539 --> 06:03.474
It's part of our new
Country Western Night!

06:03.509 --> 06:05.493
You like chicken? We got chicken.

06:05.527 --> 06:07.328
You like beer? We got beer!

06:07.379 --> 06:09.764
You like corn bread? We got corn bread!

06:09.815 --> 06:12.366
Man, now I want corn bread.

06:12.401 --> 06:13.718
Cut the bull, okay?

06:13.769 --> 06:14.769
Someone's gonna get killed.

06:14.803 --> 06:17.755
Ooh, killing someone.

06:17.790 --> 06:18.790
I like that part.

06:18.824 --> 06:20.775
Murder Mystery Night!

06:20.809 --> 06:22.743
I can hang a body in the bathroom stall.

06:24.563 --> 06:26.531
Not a real body.

06:26.582 --> 06:27.548
Unless...

06:30.569 --> 06:31.569
Hey, Hank.

06:31.603 --> 06:33.471
I'm sorry about that.

06:33.505 --> 06:35.857
I thought the knob went the other way.

06:35.891 --> 06:36.824
Anyway...

06:42.464 --> 06:43.781
Perfect.

06:43.816 --> 06:44.866
No! Come on!

06:46.752 --> 06:47.802
Hey, Tuck.

06:47.804 --> 06:50.671
Probably not the best
place to leave all this.

06:50.706 --> 06:52.607
I'm trying to keep out the devil!

06:52.641 --> 06:54.709
Don't worry, Mom's pretty
busy at the bar right now.

06:54.743 --> 06:56.544
No. Mary.

06:56.595 --> 06:57.645
She's out for blood.

06:57.696 --> 06:59.497
Type O Tuckative.

06:59.548 --> 07:00.565
(phone rings)

07:00.599 --> 07:02.517
Oh, my God.

07:02.551 --> 07:04.335
- Is that the phone?
- (Ringing continues)

07:04.369 --> 07:05.353
The phone never rings!

07:05.387 --> 07:06.470
Yeah, man, well, it does now.

07:06.522 --> 07:07.522
That's her!

07:07.556 --> 07:09.790
And every time I
answer it, a voice says,

07:09.825 --> 07:10.808
"I'm watching you, Tucker."

07:10.843 --> 07:12.360
And the scariest part is

07:12.411 --> 07:13.744
this thing wasn't even working!

07:13.795 --> 07:16.681
So... so she went through
the trouble of signing us up,

07:16.732 --> 07:18.399
and choosing a carrier,
and getting it turned on.

07:18.401 --> 07:19.834
- I mean, who has got that kind of time?!
- (Ringing continues)

07:21.720 --> 07:22.820
Hey, you know what you need?

07:22.871 --> 07:24.705
Someone to protect you.

07:24.756 --> 07:26.641
Someone who won't back down

07:26.643 --> 07:28.576
when trouble rears its ugly head.

07:28.578 --> 07:29.694
This is my moment, Tucker.

07:29.728 --> 07:30.678
Let me help you.

07:30.680 --> 07:33.631
You know you're not a real superhero.

07:33.665 --> 07:34.582
I know.

07:34.633 --> 07:36.484
You're gonna go get
your cape, aren't you?

07:36.518 --> 07:37.518
No, man. I'm just...

07:37.520 --> 07:38.603
- Just go get it, man.
- Yes!

07:41.423 --> 07:41.856
(elevator dings)

07:43.475 --> 07:44.458
Angela, hey! Um...

07:44.509 --> 07:46.494
Ben's not home and he hates you,

07:46.528 --> 07:47.862
so even if he was home...

07:47.864 --> 07:49.714
Well, you get it.

07:50.933 --> 07:53.701
Riley, I know I'm not the most
popular person around here,

07:53.752 --> 07:56.654
but don't you think every
little girl should know her mom?

07:56.688 --> 07:57.705
I don't know.

07:57.707 --> 08:00.524
I have two, and one's
weird, and one's awful,

08:00.559 --> 08:03.511
and I turned out just fine... ish.

08:03.545 --> 08:04.512
Sort of.

08:04.514 --> 08:06.530
I'm not sad at all.

08:06.565 --> 08:07.582
Besides, the only thing

08:07.616 --> 08:10.318
Emma needs right now
is a decent preschool.

08:10.369 --> 08:12.370
Oh, my God, I can
totally help with that.

08:12.404 --> 08:14.338
I went to the best one in the city.

08:14.373 --> 08:16.490
They love me at Belcrest.

08:16.525 --> 08:19.460
I'll put in a good word
for Ben if you convince him

08:19.494 --> 08:21.796
to let me spend one afternoon with Emma.

08:22.848 --> 08:23.814
- I don't know.
- Come on, Riley.

08:23.849 --> 08:25.716
He listens to you.

08:25.751 --> 08:28.586
You're smart, you're successful.

08:28.620 --> 08:30.655
Obviously, he'll always
be in love with you.

08:30.706 --> 08:32.740
Well, that's all true, but...

08:32.774 --> 08:34.609
(sighs) Oh, God.

08:34.643 --> 08:36.711
I guess I will help you.

08:36.745 --> 08:38.562
- Oh!
- For Emma, okay?

08:38.597 --> 08:39.647
Oh. Oh, we're friends now.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.433
I'll talk to Ben.

08:45.570 --> 08:46.520
(door closes)

08:49.391 --> 08:50.374
Good news.

08:50.409 --> 08:52.426
Emma and I are all set for tomorrow.

08:57.274 --> 08:59.073
Ben: Ugh, for the last time, no!

08:59.173 --> 09:00.139
Angela's not gonna see Emma.

09:00.190 --> 09:02.058
I don't wanna talk
about it anymore, okay?

09:02.092 --> 09:03.009
Okay!

09:04.128 --> 09:06.896
But she is Emma's biological mother,

09:06.930 --> 09:08.081
and if she wanted to...
Whoa. Sorry.

09:11.068 --> 09:13.836
It wouldn't make you
any less of a father

09:13.887 --> 09:14.937
if you just... Sorry.

09:18.008 --> 09:21.828
I just wish I got to know
my real mom before... Okay.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.232
You really think it's good for Emma?

09:26.234 --> 09:27.216
I do.

09:27.251 --> 09:29.268
I do. People make mistakes.

09:29.303 --> 09:31.804
And... and plus...

09:31.839 --> 09:34.173
she said she could
get Emma into Belcrest.

09:34.208 --> 09:35.241
Really?

09:35.275 --> 09:37.043
Belcrest?

09:37.045 --> 09:39.979
I hear they leave a chocolate
on each pillow for nap time.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.033
And if it makes you feel any better,

09:44.067 --> 09:47.003
okay, I will make sure
absolutely nothing goes wrong.

09:47.054 --> 09:51.791
I will be the consummate
professional Emma-Momma-Watcher.

09:51.842 --> 09:52.842
Okay.

09:53.944 --> 09:56.212
Wait. Where'd you leave Emma?

09:56.246 --> 09:57.814
I'll be right back.

09:59.233 --> 10:00.199
Emma?

10:05.172 --> 10:06.255
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Ben.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.241
Ben! Benji, hey.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.109
Hey, sweetie.

10:10.111 --> 10:12.178
What are you doing here
in the middle of the day?

10:12.212 --> 10:14.063
Shouldn't you be at work?

10:14.114 --> 10:15.998
I am.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.034
Plus, Riley convinced
me to let Angela see Emma

10:18.068 --> 10:19.952
for an hour and I want to
be gone when it happens.

10:20.003 --> 10:21.137
Angela?

10:21.188 --> 10:24.841
You left your child with the
woman who left your child?

10:24.875 --> 10:26.909
Wait. Why are there
so many women in here?

10:26.944 --> 10:27.944
(scoffs)

10:27.978 --> 10:30.296
I packed this place
to the gills with women

10:30.347 --> 10:32.231
and you're questioning me?!

10:32.233 --> 10:33.232
All right, that is it.

10:33.283 --> 10:34.283
You are out of here!

10:34.334 --> 10:37.270
Okay, when did we hire new bartenders?

10:37.304 --> 10:39.205
(ringing)

10:39.239 --> 10:41.290
Ladies, Happy Hour has just begun.

10:41.325 --> 10:44.043
Let's get ripped!

10:44.077 --> 10:45.127

- (Women cheer)

10:57.124 --> 10:58.925
- Hi.
- Mom!

10:58.927 --> 10:59.892
- What?
- No!

10:59.927 --> 11:01.277
Oh, Ben, come on! Please?

11:01.328 --> 11:02.829
Can I keep him?

11:02.880 --> 11:05.231
Look, I promise they won't eat a lot.

11:05.282 --> 11:06.866
I'll walk them twice a day,

11:06.900 --> 11:08.301
and they can sleep in my bed!

11:10.270 --> 11:11.270
Then the princess says,

11:11.321 --> 11:14.273
"Freeze or I'll drop you
like a knockoff handbag!"

11:16.126 --> 11:17.176
That's something I pitched.

11:17.178 --> 11:19.045
I basically write all my own lines.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.180
Wow.

11:21.182 --> 11:23.132
What a charming, uplifting story

11:23.166 --> 11:24.967
for a child of two.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.871
You're just gonna stand there

11:28.922 --> 11:30.022
and watch me play with
Emma the whole time?

11:30.057 --> 11:31.908
Well, I did promise Ben, so...

11:31.942 --> 11:34.260
And I promise you nothing will go wrong.

11:34.311 --> 11:35.895
(groans) Okay, fine.

11:35.946 --> 11:38.281
I will be across the
hall in my apartment

11:38.332 --> 11:40.299
where I can be reached
if you need anything.

11:40.350 --> 11:42.134
Okay? Anything at all.

11:43.237 --> 11:45.254
(door opens, closes)

11:45.305 --> 11:47.156
Finally.

11:47.190 --> 11:48.241
Wanna make some new friends?

11:50.093 --> 11:51.143
Yeah, you do.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.079
Okay, you ladies ready for this?

11:53.113 --> 11:56.032
We sure are. Right, baby girl?

11:56.066 --> 11:58.951
<i>So, this is Jess Cagle
of People Magazine here</i>

11:59.002 --> 12:01.921
<i>with Angela Davidson, the
star of TV's Cop Girl.</i>

12:01.955 --> 12:03.890
<i>Uh, TV's newest hit, Cop Girl.</i>

12:03.924 --> 12:04.974
Yeah, I've seen the show.

12:05.008 --> 12:05.975
Let's not go crazy.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.930
<i>So Angela, what People
readers really want to know is</i>

12:10.932 --> 12:13.883
what is it like juggling
a successful acting career

12:13.917 --> 12:16.218
and raising this little
girl all on your own?

12:16.270 --> 12:18.120
Oh, well, starring in a show is great,

12:18.155 --> 12:21.140
but being a mom is the
greatest role I've ever had.

12:24.261 --> 12:26.045
(chuckles)

12:26.079 --> 12:28.064
<i>Angela: I can't believe I'm
gonna be in People Magazine.</i>

12:28.115 --> 12:31.133
Thank you again for sharing
your incredible story.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.986
You are an inspiration
to women everywhere

12:34.021 --> 12:35.087
who are raising a baby on their own

12:35.138 --> 12:36.939
- and starring in a TV show.
- (Elevator dings)

12:38.008 --> 12:39.041
Jess: It's a small demographic, I know.

12:39.076 --> 12:41.277
But who says you can't have it all?

12:41.311 --> 12:44.213
Oh, and I hope you get
even with that deadbeat dad.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.316
"Deadbeat dad"?

12:48.368 --> 12:50.336
Emma, cover your ears, sweetie,

12:50.338 --> 12:52.271
'cause Aunt Riley is about
to kick your mom's ass.

13:00.443 --> 13:01.577
I cannot believe that you lied to me!

13:01.628 --> 13:03.412
All you wanted Emma for

13:03.414 --> 13:04.513
was some stupid interview?!

13:04.547 --> 13:06.448
I honestly didn't know what to do.

13:06.483 --> 13:08.367
I told my agent about Emma

13:08.401 --> 13:09.501
and she told the show's publicist,

13:09.536 --> 13:11.470
and before I could stop it,

13:11.504 --> 13:13.322
- here we are.
- Oh, where?

13:13.356 --> 13:15.424
On the corner of You're
a Bitch and You're a Liar?

13:15.458 --> 13:18.360
Oh, my God. "Deadbeat
dad"? "Single mother"?

13:18.395 --> 13:20.362
I'll try to straighten it out, I swear.

13:20.364 --> 13:22.331
Okay, the only swearing

13:22.333 --> 13:24.716
will be from Ben when he
hears what you have done.

13:24.768 --> 13:26.652
Do you really think you should tell him?

13:26.703 --> 13:29.638
I... I mean, I know how important
this whole preschool thing is.

13:29.640 --> 13:32.291
Plus, this was kind of your idea.

13:32.325 --> 13:33.709
Oh, whoa.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.527
- Okay.
- (Door opens)

13:35.562 --> 13:38.414
So, you're saying that Ben
is gonna blame me for this?

13:38.465 --> 13:40.349
- Blame you for what?
- Nothing.

13:41.534 --> 13:44.386
We... we were just
talking about Emma.

13:44.421 --> 13:45.387
Everything go okay?

13:45.389 --> 13:46.488
It went great.

13:46.490 --> 13:49.458
I'll call the school
and put in a good word.

13:49.492 --> 13:52.761
Hey, thank you for convincing
me to let Angela see Emma.

13:52.796 --> 13:55.314
At least now, I don't have to worry
about her getting into a good school.

13:55.348 --> 13:56.732
- Angela owes me that.
- (Laughs nervously)

13:56.766 --> 13:59.301
Oh... you're welcome.

13:59.335 --> 14:01.687
Just, you know, looking
out for the family.

14:01.721 --> 14:05.541
<i>Hey, unrelated, you don't
read People Magazine, right?</i>

14:09.562 --> 14:10.479
Okay, little buddy.

14:10.530 --> 14:11.580
I think we're safe.

14:11.614 --> 14:14.433
Coast is clear. No
Mary. I repeat. No Mary.

14:14.467 --> 14:15.451
Okay.

14:18.588 --> 14:20.472
(gasping)

14:20.507 --> 14:22.357
Man, you need to wash that thing.

14:22.408 --> 14:25.294
And it would have been nice if
you took your skates out first.

14:28.281 --> 14:29.281
(Tucker screams)

14:29.332 --> 14:31.300
What is it? Is it a spider?

14:31.334 --> 14:32.351
'Cause I don't do spiders.

14:32.385 --> 14:33.368
No!

14:33.403 --> 14:34.369
Look, man. It's me!

14:34.371 --> 14:36.271
This is where she's gonna kill me!

14:39.676 --> 14:41.610
See? It fits me perfectly!

14:43.530 --> 14:44.463
It's over.

14:44.514 --> 14:46.431
She wins. I am done writing about her.

14:46.483 --> 14:47.483
- Never again.
- What?

14:47.517 --> 14:48.450
No!

14:48.501 --> 14:50.498
You can't let her kill your dreams!

14:51.156 --> 14:52.940
Wait. What are your dreams?

14:54.126 --> 14:56.894
To be the world's greatest
entertainment reporter.

14:56.896 --> 14:57.895
Yeah, that!

14:57.946 --> 14:59.030
You can't let her kill that.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.931
Don't you understand, Tucker?

15:00.966 --> 15:03.734
Dreams are all we have.

15:03.785 --> 15:06.220
Dreams are what we're made of.

15:06.254 --> 15:09.173
They course through
every vein in our body.

15:09.207 --> 15:12.159
The minute you give up, evil wins.

15:14.796 --> 15:16.063
You know what?

15:16.098 --> 15:17.198
Dude, you're right.

15:17.232 --> 15:19.200
I'm done letting her walk all over me.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.217
This time, I'm fighting back.

15:20.219 --> 15:23.154
This time, I'm using her real name.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.908
(elevator dings)

15:27.943 --> 15:29.877
Oh, my God. Mrs. Wheeler, I need you.

15:29.911 --> 15:31.896
And I need wine. Is Ben home?

15:31.930 --> 15:33.030
That's what I need your help with.

15:33.065 --> 15:35.266
Good luck. He is zero fun.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.801
So not my kid.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.235
God, he's going to be so mad.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.787
Well, he won't be mad if I can

15:39.838 --> 15:41.889
just show him that I
know what I'm doing.

15:41.923 --> 15:44.225
If I could just show
him how awful she is

15:44.276 --> 15:45.276
without getting blamed.

15:45.327 --> 15:47.828
I mean, who knew that she
was such a good actress?

15:47.879 --> 15:49.263
An actress! Yes!

15:49.314 --> 15:51.282
A celebrity would get us some publicity!

15:51.316 --> 15:53.250
Oh, my God, yes! Someone
to publicly expose her!

15:53.301 --> 15:55.152
That is a great idea!

15:55.187 --> 15:57.221
Ugh, I wish Tucker still
worked for Mary Hart.

15:57.255 --> 15:59.090
Mary Hart!

15:59.092 --> 16:01.041
Mm! If she came to the bar,

16:01.076 --> 16:02.126
that would make everything perfect!

16:02.160 --> 16:04.011
- You think?
- Of course!

16:04.062 --> 16:06.030
- But she hates me.
- Well, I could get her there.

16:06.064 --> 16:07.998
Oh, my God, this is gonna be so great.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.850
She is so going down!

16:09.901 --> 16:11.986
I'm not sure what you have
against Mary, but okay!

16:14.973 --> 16:16.791
We'll be ready to roll
in two minutes, Mary.

16:18.243 --> 16:19.794
Great work getting Mary here.

16:20.879 --> 16:23.114
Wait, wait. Is that Angela?

16:23.165 --> 16:26.100
Oh, I'd like to give
her a piece of my mind

16:26.151 --> 16:28.202
and her ass a piece of my foot.

16:28.253 --> 16:30.421
I'm gonna go over there.
I'm just gonna give her...

16:30.447 --> 16:31.088
Oh, my God.

16:31.090 --> 16:34.024
Hey, hey, hey, hey! If you could
please wait until after the interview?

16:34.075 --> 16:36.010
Right. Good thinking.

16:36.044 --> 16:38.913
- Two celebs having lunch together.
- (Shutter clicks)

16:38.947 --> 16:40.047
I guess I can hate her later.

16:41.933 --> 16:42.983
Mary: So, Angela...

16:43.018 --> 16:45.886
what is it like juggling
a career with motherhood?

16:45.921 --> 16:47.855
I tried it once for about a month,

16:47.889 --> 16:48.956
but so not me.

16:48.990 --> 16:51.892
Luckily, my cousin always
wanted a baby, so she...

16:51.927 --> 16:54.879
<i>Oh, I... I thought we were just
gonna talk about my show, Cop Girl.</i>

16:54.913 --> 16:56.046
We will.

16:56.048 --> 16:58.833
But I really want to hear
about your life with Emma,

16:58.867 --> 17:01.051
who you are raising all by yourself.

17:01.102 --> 17:02.186
Yes, exactly.

17:02.237 --> 17:05.039
- Uh, but on the show, I...
- Well, funny thing.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.023
According to these papers,

17:07.058 --> 17:09.193
you relinquished all
rights to your daughter

17:09.227 --> 17:11.078
when she was only three months old.

17:11.128 --> 17:13.063
Oh. Well, I can explain. Um...

17:13.098 --> 17:15.915
I doubt it, but I'm
dying to hear you try.

17:17.953 --> 17:18.903
What's all that about?

17:18.954 --> 17:19.987
Ben! Hi! Hi!

17:20.038 --> 17:21.805
Uh, what... what
are you doing here?

17:21.839 --> 17:22.973
Again, I own the bar.

17:23.023 --> 17:24.742
What's going on?

17:24.792 --> 17:25.876
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

17:25.926 --> 17:28.229
Please don't be mad at me,
but, um, Angela tricked me

17:28.280 --> 17:29.947
and did an interview with a magazine

17:29.981 --> 17:31.799
and lied about being a single mom,

17:31.833 --> 17:33.217
and it's totally all my fault.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.768
But... but I fixed it

17:34.819 --> 17:36.253
because I convinced Mary to
come down here and expose her

17:36.288 --> 17:38.138
so the whole world will know the truth.

17:38.173 --> 17:39.223
But... but she can't
trace it back to me,

17:39.225 --> 17:41.041
so Emma can still get
into that preschool

17:41.076 --> 17:42.159
and everybody wins!

17:42.210 --> 17:44.094
Well, everybody except for Angela.

17:45.180 --> 17:47.064
Oh, my God, Riley! What have you done?

17:47.115 --> 17:48.999
Really?

17:49.001 --> 17:51.936
Do you want me to say the
whole thing over again?

17:51.938 --> 17:54.004
Please, Mary. You can't air any of this.

17:54.039 --> 17:55.839
This will ruin my career.

17:55.891 --> 17:57.057
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Everybody calm down.

17:57.108 --> 17:59.910
Mary, I think you've been
given some terrible information.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.795
Why do you look familiar?

18:01.846 --> 18:02.830
Are you somebody?

18:02.864 --> 18:03.948
It's so hard to tell these days.

18:05.800 --> 18:06.884
I am. I'm Emma's father.

18:06.935 --> 18:09.820
But all you need to know is
that Angela is her wonderful,

18:09.822 --> 18:11.855
supportive mother who's been
there since the very beginning.

18:11.890 --> 18:15.109
Well, that's a non-story.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.745
When I find out who crank called

18:17.779 --> 18:20.180
my Gotcha Tip-line,
there will be hell to pay.

18:20.215 --> 18:24.051
Mary, I just want you to know

18:24.085 --> 18:26.987
that your days of trying
to rule this city are over.

18:27.022 --> 18:29.023
How did you know I
was running for mayor?

18:29.057 --> 18:30.958
Is that Tucker?

18:31.009 --> 18:32.009
Mary.

18:32.011 --> 18:34.912
I read your little
blog post this morning.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.914
Oh? Well, there's nothing
you can do about it now.

18:36.916 --> 18:37.932
Oh, really?

18:37.966 --> 18:39.950
- Watch me!
- Whoa!

18:39.985 --> 18:40.951
- (gasps)
- Oh!

18:40.986 --> 18:41.952
- (gasps)
- (Shutter clicks)

18:42.003 --> 18:42.970
(grunts)

18:45.941 --> 18:46.957
Angela: Thank you for doing that.

18:46.992 --> 18:48.876
I know I don't deserve it.

18:48.927 --> 18:50.261
I just got so caught up in the moment,

18:50.263 --> 18:52.796
but I would never to
anything to hurt Emma.

18:52.831 --> 18:55.149
I promise I'll make sure
she gets into that school.

18:55.183 --> 18:58.085
Thanks, but I'd rather
homeschool Emma in a bar

18:58.136 --> 18:59.253
than send her anywhere
that produced you.

19:01.072 --> 19:02.206
We'll be fine on our
own. We always have been.

19:07.996 --> 19:09.913
Why are you letting
her get away with this?

19:09.915 --> 19:11.148
You need to expose her, Ben.

19:11.182 --> 19:13.067
Look, Angela may have been
the biggest mistake of my life,

19:13.118 --> 19:14.084
but she also gave me

19:14.119 --> 19:17.855
the greatest gift of my life: Emma.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.807
And if she's gonna find out
just how much her mother sucks,

19:19.841 --> 19:21.892
then I'd rather her
do it on her own terms.

19:21.926 --> 19:24.828
When she grows up and she
can ask her own questions

19:24.863 --> 19:26.764
and make her own judgments.

19:26.798 --> 19:28.232
She shouldn't have to read about it.

19:29.901 --> 19:31.819
You're an amazing dad.

19:31.870 --> 19:34.838
And honestly, if she turns
out anything like you,

19:34.889 --> 19:37.241
she'll be the best girl in the world.

19:37.275 --> 19:39.159
She's lucky to be a Wheeler.

19:41.129 --> 19:42.179
<i>Okay, people!</i>

19:42.230 --> 19:44.181
<i>Let's clear these tables!</i>

19:44.183 --> 19:46.250
<i>The pudding pool is here!</i>

19:46.284 --> 19:48.118
Mom!

19:48.120 --> 19:49.169
<i>All right, fellas!</i>

19:49.204 --> 19:50.788
<i>Let's load her in!</i>

19:50.790 --> 19:54.174
<i>Gary, if that's butterscotch,
I'm gonna kick your ass!</i>

19:54.209 --> 19:55.259
Mom!

19:55.293 --> 19:56.260
Mom!

19:58.546 --> 19:59.980
(laughter)

20:00.249 --> 20:03.835
These pictures are gonna bring
in so much business to the bar.

20:03.837 --> 20:07.171
You know, maybe you should
write about Mary for a change

20:07.173 --> 20:09.223
in that dumb blog of yours
and stop spending all your time

20:09.258 --> 20:10.224
writing about me.

20:10.259 --> 20:11.309
What are you talking about?

20:11.343 --> 20:15.847
Big Blonde Babbler,
wine-aholic, cheats on her taxes.

20:15.849 --> 20:17.849
Why would you say that stuff about me?

20:17.851 --> 20:20.184
Uh, Mom, Tucker's blog
is about Mary Hart.

20:20.235 --> 20:22.153
It's Aunt Shirley's
blog that's about you.

20:23.272 --> 20:24.272
I knew that.

20:25.357 --> 20:27.191
Hold up.

20:27.242 --> 20:30.078
Hold up, so you did
all those things to me?

20:30.112 --> 20:31.279
No...

20:31.330 --> 20:33.197
No.

20:33.199 --> 20:37.118
But I would not wear those
pants for too much longer.

20:37.169 --> 20:40.171
No! What did you...
What did you do?!

20:40.205 --> 20:41.205
- Danny, door!
- What did you do?!

20:41.207 --> 20:43.257
Danny, door! Door,
Danny! Danny, Danny, door!

20:43.292 --> 20:44.258
Danny, door!

20:46.128 --> 20:47.211
- Are you serious?!
- She's my mom!
