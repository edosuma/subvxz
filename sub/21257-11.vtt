Well, I was working at the
toaster factory 'til march,

00:42.780 --> 00:44.680
but since the layoffs I've
been driving for Uber, so--

01:37.960 --> 01:39.670
I don't know what that
means, but I hate it.

01:39.670 --> 01:41.080
Almost as much as I do my taxes.

01:41.080 --> 01:43.300
Now, what's that you were saying
about how taxes could be easy?

01:43.300 --> 01:44.860
Well, think about it.

01:44.860 --> 01:48.070
Taxes are a bill the
government charges you.

01:48.070 --> 01:50.740
So why do you have
to do all the math?

01:50.740 --> 01:53.600
Imagine if we did that
with any other bill?

01:53.600 --> 01:54.400
How much do I owe you?

01:54.400 --> 01:56.290
You tell me.

01:56.290 --> 01:59.700
Divide number of toppings
by cheese consumption. $12?

01:59.700 --> 02:02.670
Wrong.
Now you're going to jail.

02:02.670 --> 02:05.860
Instead of making you fill
out a complicated return,

02:05.860 --> 02:08.490
why doesn't the government
just tell you how much you owe?

02:08.490 --> 02:09.660
Well, because
they'd need to know

02:09.660 --> 02:11.410
my income, my interest
on my savings,

02:11.410 --> 02:13.000
all the numbers that
are on those forms.

OK, we just got
Hank's W-2s and 1099s.

could, quite literally,

02:34.300 --> 02:36.250
do your taxes for you.

02:36.250 --> 02:38.980
It's an idea called
return free filing.

02:38.980 --> 02:40.870
Instead of the government
checking your work,

02:40.870 --> 02:42.460
you'd check theirs.

02:42.460 --> 02:45.670

look more like this.

that makes that much sense.

03:11.470 --> 03:14.020
Actually, return free
filing bills are introduced

03:14.020 --> 03:17.860
in Congress all the time and
both Barack Obama and Ronald

03:17.860 --> 03:19.240
Reagan pushed for it.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.470
Yes we can.

my money to do it.

04:10.310 --> 04:11.530
Well, that's shameless.

04:11.530 --> 04:13.480
And it gets worse.

04:13.480 --> 04:16.290
This is Jessica Huseman,
a reporter at ProPublica

04:16.290 --> 04:17.560
who's covered this story.

04:17.560 --> 04:20.560
The tax prep industry
actually created a front group

04:20.560 --> 04:22.510
called the FreeFile
Alliance that lets

04:22.510 --> 04:24.580
you file your taxes for free.

04:24.580 --> 04:28.090
It's supposed to be available
to 2/3 of the taxpaying public,

04:28.090 --> 04:30.370
but almost no one uses it.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.440
That's because the
system is confusing,

04:32.440 --> 04:35.860
the IRS doesn't market it, the
tax companies have no incentive

04:35.860 --> 04:39.010
to push it themselves,
and a sneaky opt in option

04:39.010 --> 04:41.470
allows them to push
their paid products.

04:41.470 --> 04:44.320
Don't use the free
option it's too hard.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.790
Pay me instead.

04:45.790 --> 04:48.550
But I want return free filing
like you were talking about.

04:48.550 --> 04:50.080
Well, here's the worst part.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.840
The tax industry negotiated
an exclusive deal

04:52.840 --> 04:55.750
that prevents the federal
government from offering return

04:55.750 --> 04:59.360
free filing or any free
system of tax filing

04:59.360 --> 05:02.140
so long as the FreeFile
Alliance exists.

05:02.140 --> 05:04.120
So you're saying the
government could do my taxes

05:04.120 --> 05:06.880
for me for free,
but TurboTax and H&amp;R

05:06.880 --> 05:08.800

to stop that from happening?

05:08.800 --> 05:09.910

taxes yourself with this guy.

Nope.

It tells you how a tiny part
of the stock market is doing,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.820

is deeply flawed.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.070

30 big companies

07:43.070 --> 07:45.260
was actually pretty
useful information.

07:45.260 --> 07:47.900
But as our economy grew
and became more complex,

07:47.900 --> 07:50.420

Hi, I'm Charles.

09:12.210 --> 09:13.410
I'm 52.

09:13.410 --> 09:17.310
And this week I mowed my
neighbor's lawn for $25.

09:17.310 --> 09:20.470
That's-- that's all the
work I've had in months.

09:20.470 --> 09:22.150
Well, he must
count as unemployed.

09:22.150 --> 09:24.120
[BUZZER]
- No again.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.870
And finally, we have Hank.

09:25.870 --> 09:26.740
Me?

09:26.740 --> 09:29.350
Well, I drive Uber some nights
since the factory closed.

09:29.350 --> 09:31.140
But I'm barely making by.
I'm unemployed.

09:31.140 --> 09:31.880
[BUZZER]

09:31.880 --> 09:32.760
Wrong again.

09:32.760 --> 09:33.840
You don't count either.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.970
Thanks for playing and
remember to spell and grammar

09:35.970 --> 09:37.470
check your resume.

09:37.470 --> 09:38.820
Why don't I count
as unemployed?

09:38.820 --> 09:40.560
Well, the number
we always hear

09:40.560 --> 09:44.040
reported as the unemployment
rate only counts people who

09:44.040 --> 09:46.200
are actively looking
for work and excludes

09:46.200 --> 09:49.590
anyone who's earned more
than $20 in the past week.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.510
Now, that doesn't make
it totally useless

09:51.510 --> 09:53.850
but if you hear that number and
think that's how many people

09:53.850 --> 09:55.500
are out of work, you're wrong.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.970
Many more are struggling.

09:56.970 --> 09:58.800
Yeah, like me.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.080
That's enough for bloated
Anderson Cooper here.

10:07.250 --> 10:08.440
[HORN]
- Yes!

10:08.440 --> 10:09.430
GDP!

10:09.430 --> 10:11.020
The bigger it gets,
the better the economy

10:11.020 --> 10:11.770
is, right Cray Cray?

10:11.770 --> 10:12.850
Absolutely!

10:12.850 --> 10:15.090
Let's take a look at
the latest figure--

10:15.090 --> 10:15.880
Sorry.

10:15.880 --> 10:19.600
Even though politicians and
the media act like GDP--

10:19.600 --> 10:21.520
or gross domestic product--

10:21.520 --> 10:25.210
is a measure of our overall
economic well-being, it ain't.

10:25.210 --> 10:27.640
GDP really only tells
us how much we make

10:27.640 --> 10:29.080
and how much we consume.

10:29.080 --> 10:31.960
In other words, it goes
up when spending does.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.310
I got a raise.

10:33.310 --> 10:35.350
I'm going to buy a catamaran.

10:35.350 --> 10:37.520
That's good for me, Mr. GDP.

10:37.520 --> 10:41.740
But the problem is, spending
isn't always a good thing.

10:41.740 --> 10:44.510
GDP could also go up because
something bad happened

10:44.510 --> 10:47.260
and we had to spend
money to fix it.

10:47.260 --> 10:48.850
My house was
destroyed in a hurricane

10:48.850 --> 10:51.010
so I need to buy a
tent to sleep in.

10:51.010 --> 10:52.270
Here's all my savings.

10:52.270 --> 10:55.860
All spending is good
spending for Mr. GDP.

10:55.860 --> 10:57.780
But she lost her
house and her savings.

10:57.780 --> 10:59.470
That can't be good
for the economy.

10:59.470 --> 11:02.540
No, but she spent
money so GDP goes up.

11:02.540 --> 11:04.390
I thought when GDP rose
that meant things were

11:04.390 --> 11:05.580
getting better for everybody?

11:05.580 --> 11:09.310
Sadly, a strong GDP doesn't
guarantee the average person

11:09.310 --> 11:10.960
feels any benefit.

11:10.960 --> 11:14.350
In the last two decades GDP has
steadily risen, but the average

11:14.350 --> 11:16.240
American's earnings haven't.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.660
It's actually possible to have
the highest GDP and the most

11:19.660 --> 11:21.470
poverty at the same time.

Well, it has its uses.

11:27.370 --> 11:29.440
You just can't expect

the truth about our
gargantuan global economy.

11:32.380 --> 11:37.040

it's just not that simple.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.580
I can't believe you, Cray.

11:38.580 --> 11:40.990

Well, I don't need simple.

11:48.030 --> 11:50.280
I learned how to use a
backwood extrusion press,

11:50.280 --> 11:51.570
I can learn a little economics.

11:51.570 --> 11:54.000
Maybe it'll even help me
figure out when my old factory

11:54.000 --> 11:55.110

where did my high paying

12:22.140 --> 12:24.890
Yeah, that's like
eerily accurate.

12:24.890 --> 12:28.710
Well, I'm here to tell
you we only lost those jobs

12:28.710 --> 12:31.270
because of bozo politicians.

Sorry, Hank.

12:43.470 --> 12:45.630
But as tempting as
it is to blame bozos,

12:45.630 --> 12:48.420
they're not why America
lost those jobs.

12:48.420 --> 12:51.380
It was the result of
massive historical forces.

12:51.380 --> 12:53.310
Well now, hold on a second.

12:53.310 --> 12:55.920
My dad came to this town
looking for opportunity and he

12:55.920 --> 12:58.080
and everybody here
worked their entire lives

12:58.080 --> 12:59.710
at the toaster factory.

12:59.710 --> 13:00.840
They earned a
middle class income.

13:00.840 --> 13:01.540
They bought houses.

13:01.540 --> 13:03.060
And they retired on a pension.

wasn't normal at all.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.860

13:14.030 --> 13:17.720
MAN: The story of
American manufacturing.

13:17.720 --> 13:21.890
Between 1945 and 1973,
American manufacturing

13:21.890 --> 13:24.500
gave us the greatest
period of economic growth

13:24.500 --> 13:26.300
in human history.

13:26.300 --> 13:29.330
Economic historians
call it the golden age

13:29.330 --> 13:31.700
but it wouldn't have been
possible without the help

13:31.700 --> 13:34.050
of World War II.

13:34.050 --> 13:37.790
During the war every other
industrialized nation involved

13:37.790 --> 13:39.230
was devastated.

13:39.230 --> 13:40.700
That meant that
when the war ended,

13:40.700 --> 13:43.700
the US had a huge
temporary advantage.

13:43.700 --> 13:46.410
From the end of the
war through the 1960s,

13:46.410 --> 13:50.090
America made 50% of
the world's stuff.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.370
And it meant great
things for Americans.

13:52.370 --> 13:54.980
By the '70s we more than
doubled the standard

13:54.980 --> 13:57.410
of living for the
average American family.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.860
Ah, now, that's the life.

14:03.860 --> 14:07.750
The problem was, this
monopoly couldn't last forever.

14:07.750 --> 14:10.550
As time marched on,
other nations rebuilt.

14:10.550 --> 14:13.400

and they started bolstering

14:13.400 --> 14:15.150
their own manufacturing.

[SPEAKING GERMAN]

14:20.570 --> 14:23.180
The real reason
America's golden age ended

14:23.180 --> 14:25.100
is because of history.

14:25.100 --> 14:26.960
But you're ignoring the
fact that American companies

14:26.960 --> 14:28.520
are choosing to
make stuff overseas.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.350
Like, why is the
iPhone made in China?

14:30.350 --> 14:33.130
We can make all that stuff they
built over there, over here.

couldn't because of--

that America cannot recreate.

14:40.640 --> 14:44.420
Well, it's not quite as
simple as China beat America,

14:44.420 --> 14:47.450
but China does excel at
certain kinds of manufacturing.

14:47.450 --> 14:50.630
This is Dr. Penelope
Prime, economist, professor

14:50.630 --> 14:52.520
at the Institute of
International Business,

14:52.520 --> 14:54.770
and Director of the
China Research Center.

14:54.770 --> 14:58.070
First of all, China has a
vast, relatively inexpensive

14:58.070 --> 14:59.090
workforce.

14:59.090 --> 15:02.780
They have about 80 million
manufacturing workers alone.

15:02.780 --> 15:05.450
That's double the
population of California.

15:05.450 --> 15:07.910
And the Chinese factories
that assemble the iPhone

15:07.910 --> 15:09.260
are massive.

15:09.260 --> 15:13.760
Just one can employ
up to 350,000 people

15:13.760 --> 15:16.730
and produce half a
million iPhones a day.

15:16.730 --> 15:18.590
And historically,
China's workers

15:18.590 --> 15:21.410
have been willing to accept
relatively low wages.

15:21.410 --> 15:25.250
Before 1978, China had
zero trade with the US

15:25.250 --> 15:27.680
and was closed to most
foreign investment.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.330
When they finally
opened their doors

15:29.330 --> 15:31.650
after years of
economic isolation

15:31.650 --> 15:35.860
they were an ideal location
for low cost manufacturing.

15:35.860 --> 15:37.690
Well, we have workers too.

15:37.690 --> 15:39.470
But our government
today does not

15:39.470 --> 15:42.950
invest heavily in infrastructure
and education like China does.

15:42.950 --> 15:45.830
The Chinese government even
helps recruit and train

15:45.830 --> 15:47.540
workers for jobs like this.

15:47.540 --> 15:50.150
Apple estimated it would
take up to nine months

15:50.150 --> 15:53.510
to find enough engineers to
oversee a factory in the US.

15:53.510 --> 15:57.070
But in China, they found
them in just 15 days.

15:57.070 --> 15:58.820
Come on, people!

15:58.820 --> 16:01.820
I'm offering free Frisbees.

16:01.820 --> 16:03.790
Well, what if we did
train enough people?

16:03.790 --> 16:05.140
Could we build iPhone then?
-

16:05.140 --> 16:05.840
No.

16:05.840 --> 16:09.620
China sits at the center of
a global supply chain, which

16:09.620 --> 16:12.650
means they're physically closer
to most of the parts needed

16:12.650 --> 16:14.000
to make the iPhone.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.330
That means even if we did
build a giant iPhone assembly

16:17.330 --> 16:20.420
plant in the US and somehow
staffed it with cheap,

16:20.420 --> 16:24.320
well-trained labor, it would
still be faster and cheaper

16:24.320 --> 16:27.410
to build iPhones in China
then ship all the parts

16:27.410 --> 16:30.040
and assemble them here.

16:30.040 --> 16:33.850
The fact is, when it comes to
certain types of manufacturing,

16:33.850 --> 16:38.310
China has unique advantages
that we just don't.

16:38.310 --> 16:40.080
So what, we're just screwed?

16:40.080 --> 16:42.270
No matter what we do
we're falling behind?

16:42.270 --> 16:45.450
Actually, it's a misconception
that the US is falling

16:45.450 --> 16:47.100
behind in manufacturing.

16:47.100 --> 16:50.290

people working in those jobs

16:50.290 --> 16:54.740

17:00.790 --> 17:04.510
Well, that's an exaggeration,
but it's true that automation

17:04.510 --> 17:06.730
has transformed our economy.

17:06.730 --> 17:09.340
Heavy industry jobs
like car manufacturing

17:09.340 --> 17:13.450
were lost almost entirely
to advances in technology.

17:13.450 --> 17:15.550
For example,
General Motors still

17:15.550 --> 17:17.560
makes tons of cars in America.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.510
But today, they'd
only need a quarter

17:19.510 --> 17:23.200
of the workers it took to do the
same lot of work in the '50s.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.810
And it's not just
manufacturing jobs.

17:25.810 --> 17:28.690
Bank tellers have been
replaced by ATMs and apps.

17:28.690 --> 17:32.080
Video store employees have been
replaced by streaming sites.

17:32.080 --> 17:35.860
And even lawyers and accountants
have been replaced by software.

17:35.860 --> 17:37.330
I'm back.

17:37.330 --> 17:38.060
Gah!

17:38.060 --> 17:39.190

jobs disappeared:

17:41.780 --> 17:45.520
the last half century of
technological progress.

17:45.520 --> 17:48.880
And the story is much bigger
than just the US and China.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.770
The value of
manufacturing itself

17:50.770 --> 17:53.560
is actually falling
across the globe.

17:53.560 --> 17:56.620
Today, goods are worth
less than services.

17:56.620 --> 17:59.530
The part of the iPhone
that's a manufactured good

17:59.530 --> 18:01.330
is actually worth very little.

18:01.330 --> 18:04.780
But the services that go into
it: the software, the design,

18:04.780 --> 18:07.270
the marketing, are
much more valuable.

18:07.270 --> 18:10.180
And we do all those
things in the US.

18:10.180 --> 18:12.850
Even though there are fewer
manufacturing jobs then there

18:12.850 --> 18:15.880
used to be, new service
jobs are being created here

18:15.880 --> 18:17.980
all the time,
especially in fields

18:17.980 --> 18:20.280
like software development,
health care services,

18:20.280 --> 18:22.340
and education services.

18:22.340 --> 18:24.700
So instead of making
impossible promises

18:24.700 --> 18:27.670
to reverse history and
bring the old jobs back,

18:27.670 --> 18:30.400
our politicians should have
been taking action to help

18:30.400 --> 18:32.420
us adapt to these changes.

18:32.420 --> 18:35.410
Like by lowering the
cost of higher education

18:35.410 --> 18:38.980
so more people would have
access to these new jobs.

18:38.980 --> 18:41.890
But I'm looking for
a job in manufacturing.

18:41.890 --> 18:42.730
That's all I know.

18:45.430 --> 18:47.080
I know it's hard.

18:47.080 --> 18:50.500
But the truth is,
economies change.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.790
That's just what they do.

18:52.790 --> 18:55.090
Even if we wanted
to, we can't turn

18:55.090 --> 18:59.320
back the clock to the economy
we had half a century ago.

18:59.320 --> 19:03.530
And anyone who tells
you otherwise is wrong.

19:03.530 --> 19:05.660
Now, there are things
that you can do--

19:05.660 --> 19:07.850
Ah, forget it.

19:07.850 --> 19:09.590
I guess there's no place
in this shiny new economy

19:09.590 --> 19:12.740
for a guy like me.

19:12.740 --> 19:15.150
Hank, no.

19:15.150 --> 19:17.350
This goes in recycling.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

19:21.460 --> 19:22.900
Sorry, Max.

19:22.900 --> 19:23.740
Can't find work.

19:23.740 --> 19:24.670
I'm going to lose the house.

19:24.670 --> 19:25.690
I guess I'm going to have
to shack up with you.

19:25.690 --> 19:28.510
[DOG WHINES]
- OK, that's a tad dramatic.

19:28.510 --> 19:30.830
What am I supposed to do?

19:30.830 --> 19:32.740
The economy is so complicated.

19:32.740 --> 19:34.540
I've got no control over it.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.520
It changes right
under your feet and it

19:36.520 --> 19:37.660
puts good people out of work.

19:37.660 --> 19:40.610
It just makes me
feel so powerless.

19:40.610 --> 19:42.250
Well, you're right.

19:42.250 --> 19:46.600
The economy is insanely complex
and it's always changing.

19:46.600 --> 19:49.520
But that doesn't mean
there's nothing you can do.

19:49.520 --> 19:50.590
What do you mean?

19:50.590 --> 19:53.680
Well, you can take steps
to adapt along with it.

19:53.680 --> 19:54.910
Yeah, my sister
has been telling me

19:54.910 --> 19:56.990
there's more jobs
down by where she is.

19:56.990 --> 19:58.090
And she knows a
good night school

19:58.090 --> 19:59.590
if I want to try something new.

19:59.590 --> 20:01.460
I guess I could think
about doing that.

20:01.460 --> 20:03.940
But come on, not everybody
can afford to move.

20:03.940 --> 20:05.170
That's true.

20:05.170 --> 20:09.130
Adapting to all these changes
is a huge, daunting, expensive

20:09.130 --> 20:10.510
investment for workers.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.100
And our government
could help people

20:12.100 --> 20:14.080
more with that
investment with things

20:14.080 --> 20:16.750
like relocation vouchers
and especially higher

20:16.750 --> 20:18.940
education and skills training.

20:18.940 --> 20:21.010
Like how in Georgia,
where I live,

20:21.010 --> 20:23.890
there's state-subsidized skills
training that's coordinated

20:23.890 --> 20:25.870
with new factory
openings to encourage

20:25.870 --> 20:27.580
companies to set up there.

20:27.580 --> 20:31.450
We can't control whether or
not the economy changes but we

20:31.450 --> 20:34.090
have a responsibility
to help ourselves

20:34.090 --> 20:36.120
and each other adjust
to those changes.

Well, thanks Dr. Prime.

was two dimensional.

new opportunities

Thanks, Adam.

You know, I'm going to
give my sister a call.

20:55.890 --> 20:57.090
Might be a big
change, but I think

20:57.090 --> 20:59.580
with her help I can swing it.

20:59.580 --> 21:01.980
And don't you worry,
I know one day

21:01.980 --> 21:04.960
you're going to find a job too.

for 20 minutes!

21:14.620 --> 21:15.340
Hello, everyone.

21:15.340 --> 21:16.930
I am using the power
of the internet

21:16.930 --> 21:18.940
to talk to Jessica
Huseman from ProPublica's

21:18.940 --> 21:20.080
office in New York.

21:20.080 --> 21:21.830
Jessica, thank you so
much for being here.

21:21.830 --> 21:22.730
Thanks for having me.

21:22.730 --> 21:25.840
Can you tell a little bit
more about the FreeFile Alliance

21:25.840 --> 21:28.900
and the role that they play
in changing how all of us

21:28.900 --> 21:30.410
do our taxes?
- Sure.

21:30.410 --> 21:34.450
So the FreeFile Alliance
is a group of 13 tax filing

21:34.450 --> 21:36.490
and preparation companies,
and you've probably

21:36.490 --> 21:37.330
heard of a lot of them.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.790
They're places like
Intuit, H&amp;R Block.

21:39.790 --> 21:42.730
This FreeFile Alliance spends
thousands and thousands

21:42.730 --> 21:46.360
of dollars every year to lobby
individual members of Congress,

21:46.360 --> 21:48.520
many of whom then
write bills to ensure

21:48.520 --> 21:50.680
that the government doesn't
offer its own system

21:50.680 --> 21:53.500
of free filing for taxes.

21:53.500 --> 21:54.400
It's just so crazy.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.870
The idea that they're
taking the money

21:55.870 --> 21:58.420
that we pay them to
make our taxes easier,

21:58.420 --> 21:59.980
and they're using
it to lobby Congress

21:59.980 --> 22:01.480
to make our taxes
more difficult,

22:01.480 --> 22:02.620
or to keep them difficult.

22:02.620 --> 22:04.550
Yeah, this is not
a Republican issue,

22:04.550 --> 22:05.950
this is not a Democratic issue.

22:05.950 --> 22:09.610
That money tastes good to both
parties and they both take it.

22:09.610 --> 22:12.280
The system that we have
set up, as confusing

22:12.280 --> 22:15.700
as it is, as much help as
you need to file your taxes,

22:15.700 --> 22:18.430
that is entirely within
the FreeFile Alliance's

22:18.430 --> 22:20.110
best interest, right?

22:20.110 --> 22:21.430
Every single one
of their corporate

22:21.430 --> 22:23.740
reports that they give, their
quarterly reports that they

22:23.740 --> 22:26.370
give to investors,
they list the risk

22:26.370 --> 22:27.730
that the government
could come up

22:27.730 --> 22:30.220
with a free system
as an inherent risk

22:30.220 --> 22:30.940
to their business.

22:30.940 --> 22:33.670
You can see that every quarterly
report that Intuit files

22:33.670 --> 22:35.320
they list that specifically.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.450
So they've very concerned
about something like this

22:37.450 --> 22:38.770
happening and they're
paying thousands

22:38.770 --> 22:40.170
of dollars so that it won't.

22:40.170 --> 22:42.260
Yeah, they want the
problem to stay in place

22:42.260 --> 22:44.350
so they can keep
selling us the solution.

22:44.350 --> 22:45.760
They don't want the
problem to be fixed.

22:45.760 --> 22:46.540
Right, exactly.

22:46.540 --> 22:48.430
And you know, they've done
a lot of tricky things

22:48.430 --> 22:50.650
to make you think that
they're on your side.

22:50.650 --> 22:53.590
So the FreeFile Alliance
a couple of years

22:53.590 --> 22:56.350
ago got a bunch of
community members to write--

22:56.350 --> 22:59.440
like, they handed them
pre-written letters

22:59.440 --> 23:00.800
to the editor that
they would send

23:00.800 --> 23:03.260
in to all of these newspapers
across the country.

23:03.260 --> 23:07.150
So like rabbis did this,
city councilmen did this.

23:07.150 --> 23:09.040
Because they'd get a call
from the FreeFile Alliance

23:09.040 --> 23:11.080
with this great
pitch being like,

23:11.080 --> 23:15.320
we provide free tax services
for the lowest 2/3 of Americans.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.440
They leave out that they're
making your taxes more

23:17.440 --> 23:19.480
complicated and the only
reason the government

23:19.480 --> 23:22.450
doesn't provide it to everyone
for free is because of them.

23:22.450 --> 23:24.850
Well, going back to
return free filing.

23:24.850 --> 23:27.670
I'm sure that a lot
of people in America

23:27.670 --> 23:29.180
would be suspicious
of that at first.

23:29.180 --> 23:31.600
Like, wait a second, if the
government is the one doing

23:31.600 --> 23:35.130
my taxes how am I going to know
that they're doing it right,

23:35.130 --> 23:35.830
etc?

23:35.830 --> 23:37.180
I mean, what's the
response to that?

23:37.180 --> 23:40.360
Right, so this in system
would be entirely voluntary.

23:40.360 --> 23:43.480
So the government already knows
quite a lot of information

23:43.480 --> 23:45.130
about you, which I
don't think that most

23:45.130 --> 23:46.540
people who pay taxes realize.

23:46.540 --> 23:48.130
You might as well use
that to your advantage.

23:48.130 --> 23:49.960
And I say, use that
to your advantage

23:49.960 --> 23:51.370
because there are
a lot of situations

23:51.370 --> 23:54.070
in which the government
might not actually be aware

23:54.070 --> 23:55.420
that you have some income.

23:55.420 --> 23:58.110
And so if they say, here's
what we know about you,

23:58.110 --> 24:01.240
you could probably choose
whether or not to volunteer

24:01.240 --> 24:02.860
that you had this
extra income that they

24:02.860 --> 24:04.570
don't know about that
you might or might

24:04.570 --> 24:06.140
not want to pay taxes on.

24:06.140 --> 24:07.780
So this is actually
quite a powerful thing

24:07.780 --> 24:09.940
for the American taxpayer
to know about themselves.

24:09.940 --> 24:13.270
Because as it stands,
right, I have no idea what

24:13.270 --> 24:14.800
the IRS already knows about me.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.270
I have no idea what the
federal government is aware

24:17.270 --> 24:19.510
that I make every year,
even though they probably

24:19.510 --> 24:21.070
know just about everything.

24:21.070 --> 24:22.900
That's a good
point because, yeah,

24:22.900 --> 24:24.490
we don't actually
know the information

24:24.490 --> 24:25.540
that they've been given.

24:25.540 --> 24:28.210
It's like this weird test that
we don't have to take, just

24:28.210 --> 24:30.220
tell me what you
want and then we'll

24:30.220 --> 24:31.390
use that as a starting point.

24:31.390 --> 24:32.860
Yeah, for sure, for sure.

24:32.860 --> 24:34.780
Well Jessica, thank
you so much for your work

24:34.780 --> 24:35.550
