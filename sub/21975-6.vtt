<font color="#fff00">Corrected & Synced by Bakugan</font>

00:09.467 --> 00:11.533
My name is Nathan Fielder.

00:11.633 --> 00:13.000
And I graduated from one of
Canada's top business schools

00:13.100 --> 00:15.400
with really good grades.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.767
Now I'm using my knowledge
to help struggling

00:17.867 --> 00:22.233
small business owners make it
in this competitive world.

00:22.333 --> 00:25.933
This is "Nathan For You."

00:26.033 --> 00:28.767
If you're handing over
your computer to a stranger,

00:28.867 --> 00:31.600
there's nothing you care more
about than your privacy.

00:31.700 --> 00:35.400
So for computer repair shops
like Los Angeles based Cyberguy,

00:35.445 --> 00:38.012
earning customers' trust
is a huge struggle.

00:38.167 --> 00:41.400
We are saying that we're not
gonna look at the files

00:41.500 --> 00:43.700
and folders or private files,

00:43.800 --> 00:45.533
but they don't trust.

00:45.633 --> 00:47.467
The reason is that most of us

00:47.567 --> 00:50.067
have things on our computer
that we don't want seen.

00:50.167 --> 00:52.567
As someone with a recurring
medical issue,

00:52.667 --> 00:54.400
I keep photos on my laptop

00:54.500 --> 00:56.700
that are meant only
for my doctor's eyes.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.533
And when my computer breaks down,

00:58.633 --> 01:00.767
I can never be certain
that a repair technician

01:00.867 --> 01:02.767
won't be tempted to snoop.

01:02.867 --> 01:05.167
But fortunately for Cyberguy
owner Herman Akbiyik,

01:05.266 --> 01:06.933
I had a solution.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.067
Your biggest problem is,
no matter how much

01:09.100 --> 01:10.900
you tell your customers
you're not gonna look

01:11.067 --> 01:14.067
at their nude or sexy pics,

01:14.133 --> 01:16.133
they'll always be skeptical.

01:16.233 --> 01:18.700
Because you're a sexual being, right?

01:18.800 --> 01:21.933
Okay, so whatever desire I have,

01:22.067 --> 01:24.933
it's not gonna be
affecting my business.

01:25.067 --> 01:26.933
What do you mean?

01:27.067 --> 01:30.400
Okay, if you don't eat food,
you're hungry always, okay?

01:30.500 --> 01:32.067
Mm-hmm.

01:32.133 --> 01:34.333
If you eat food, you're gonna be full.

01:34.433 --> 01:37.533
You don't feel anymore your hunger.

01:37.633 --> 01:39.167
Right.

01:39.267 --> 01:42.833
So if you don't pleasure
yourself at home,

01:42.933 --> 01:45.367
maybe you're gonna
feel it at the office

01:45.467 --> 01:47.333
or while walking on the street

01:47.433 --> 01:49.667
you can feel those desires, in a way.

01:49.767 --> 01:54.067
So you're saying you pleasure
yourself so much at home

01:54.133 --> 01:56.067
that it doesn't affect you at work.

01:56.133 --> 01:57.800
Correct.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.500
Despite Herman's claim that

01:59.600 --> 02:01.267
he gets everything out of his system

02:01.367 --> 02:03.100
before arriving at work each morning,

02:03.200 --> 02:05.400
his customers will never
completely trust him,

02:05.500 --> 02:07.400
because he's a sexual being.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.800
But if Herman recruited
repair technicians

02:09.900 --> 02:13.667
from the 1% of Americans
who identify as asexual,

02:13.767 --> 02:16.733
meaning they have no
sexual desires whatsoever,

02:16.833 --> 02:18.733
customers could finally feel confident

02:18.833 --> 02:20.533
about getting their computers repaired

02:20.633 --> 02:22.067
without the staff being tempted

02:22.167 --> 02:24.300
to look at their private photos.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.600
The plan: Put customers at ease

02:26.700 --> 02:30.267
by offering the world's first
asexual computer repair.

02:30.367 --> 02:32.067
I see.

02:32.100 --> 02:35.333
When they see any image... nude image,

02:35.433 --> 02:40.067
so they're not gonna be desired
or affecting.

02:40.167 --> 02:41.367
In theory, yes.

02:41.467 --> 02:43.367
In theory. I see.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.467
Neither Herman nor I
knew much about asexuality,

02:45.567 --> 02:47.633
but he was willing to give it a shot.

02:47.733 --> 02:51.467
So I went to the internet's
most popular asexuality forum

02:51.567 --> 02:53.300
and posted a job notification

02:53.400 --> 02:55.533
to see if anyone would fit the criteria

02:55.633 --> 02:57.333
that Herman would need.

02:57.433 --> 02:58.833
And later that week,
I set up interviews

02:58.933 --> 03:00.867
with everyone who responded.

03:00.967 --> 03:03.867
You know, just the lack of
feeling a sexual attraction

03:03.967 --> 03:08.433
and need for sex is all that
asexuality truly is.

03:08.533 --> 03:10.667
And there's a spectrum to it too.

03:10.767 --> 03:12.267
So if you're not thinking about sex,

03:12.367 --> 03:14.167
what are you thinking about?

03:14.267 --> 03:15.500
It always depends.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.200
I mean, I suppose most of the time

03:17.300 --> 03:19.600
I'm actually thinking
about superheroes.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.400
Uh, my favorite of which being Aquaman,

03:21.500 --> 03:23.133
hence the orange shirt.

03:23.233 --> 03:24.333
So when most people
are thinking of sex,

03:24.433 --> 03:26.267
you're thinking of Aquaman?

03:26.367 --> 03:29.200
Well, that's a funny way
of putting it, but I suppose so.

03:29.300 --> 03:32.067
After learning more about the
asexual lifestyle,

03:32.100 --> 03:34.633
I was feeling optimistic
that this could work.

03:34.733 --> 03:37.100
So right now, sitting across from me,

03:37.200 --> 03:39.433
you feel no sexual attraction.

03:39.533 --> 03:41.767
No. You're another person to me.

03:41.867 --> 03:43.200
Whoa.

03:43.300 --> 03:45.967
I was born an asexual,

03:46.067 --> 03:48.600
and I assume that I shall

03:48.700 --> 03:52.100
still be an asexual
upon leaving this world.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.300
So after a rigorous vetting process,

03:54.400 --> 03:57.667
using a heart rate monitor
to judge their physical response

03:57.767 --> 03:59.733
to a series of stimulating images

03:59.833 --> 04:01.867
I found in a stock photo database...

04:01.967 --> 04:04.567
Do you find this
sexually arousing or...

04:04.667 --> 04:05.600
No.

04:05.700 --> 04:06.933
- No.
- No.

04:07.067 --> 04:08.533
I offered the job to the two

04:08.633 --> 04:10.400
who showed no spike in heart rate,

04:10.500 --> 04:13.100
no matter how stimulating
the image was.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.200
So the next day,
I brought the new recruits

04:15.300 --> 04:17.567
to Cyberguy to introduce them
to Herman.

04:17.666 --> 04:19.767
So this is Nicki and Randy.

04:19.867 --> 04:22.233
- And they're asexual.
- Okay.

04:22.333 --> 04:24.433
Which means they don't have a desire

04:24.533 --> 04:30.600
to look at any customers'
private nudes or sexy photos or,

04:30.700 --> 04:32.667
you know, they just
don't have those urges.

04:32.767 --> 04:34.567
And also a sense of privacy.

04:34.667 --> 04:36.067
- I mean...
- Yeah, definitely.

04:36.167 --> 04:37.633
Yeah, because...

04:37.733 --> 04:39.067
Privacy's important to everybody.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.667
Of asexuality.

04:40.767 --> 04:43.933
Right, but someone like Herman
might be tempted.

04:44.067 --> 04:45.633
Yeah, possibility.

04:45.733 --> 04:47.867
Right, yeah, but you wouldn't
be tempted ever.

04:47.967 --> 04:48.900
- No, no, no.
- Right.

04:49.067 --> 04:50.933
So that's why.

04:51.067 --> 04:52.767
Their lack of arousal was perfect,

04:52.867 --> 04:55.133
but they still weren't
computer experts.

04:55.233 --> 04:57.567
I've removed viruses
from computers before,

04:57.667 --> 04:59.200
but with instructions.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.933
So knowing they would need Herman's

05:01.067 --> 05:02.933
close guidance when doing a repair,

05:03.067 --> 05:05.800
I installed a series of walls
in the back of the store

05:05.900 --> 05:08.600
to create a quarantined
viewing booth for Herman

05:08.700 --> 05:12.667
so the repair area would remain
free of sexual contamination.

05:12.767 --> 05:15.400
The only access point
into the inner chamber

05:15.500 --> 05:17.867
was through a military-grade
key code lock

05:17.967 --> 05:20.400
that only the asexuals
would have the code to.

05:20.500 --> 05:23.200
So after putting up
a brand-new banner out front,

05:23.300 --> 05:25.200
and giving the repair staff their code

05:25.300 --> 05:26.733
to enter the desexualized zone...

05:26.833 --> 05:30.567
The code is 1, 2, 3, 4.

05:30.667 --> 05:31.933
Okay?

05:32.067 --> 05:34.367
So don't tell Herman. Okay.

05:34.467 --> 05:37.533
They securely sealed themselves
inside the repair area,

05:37.633 --> 05:41.367
while me and Herman waited
for customers up front.

05:41.467 --> 05:42.900
You didn't see the code, right?

05:43.067 --> 05:43.933
No, I didn't.

05:44.067 --> 05:44.933
Do you promise?

05:45.067 --> 05:46.467
I promise.

05:51.467 --> 05:52.867
Okay.

05:56.900 --> 05:59.600
Before long,
the first customer arrived.

05:59.700 --> 06:01.600
It's, like, very slow.

06:01.700 --> 06:03.400
And it's hard for me to get to
the Internet sometimes.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.300
So it was time to see
if he'd be impressed

06:05.400 --> 06:06.833
by the new service.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.400
So I don't know if you saw our sign,

06:08.500 --> 06:11.467
but only computer repair shop in town

06:11.567 --> 06:14.167
that offers a fully asexual
repair service.

06:14.267 --> 06:15.600
Okay.

06:15.700 --> 06:16.933
Are you familiar with asexuals?

06:17.067 --> 06:18.867
Uh, no, I'm not.

06:18.967 --> 06:22.367
Okay, so the entire time
your computer is here,

06:22.467 --> 06:26.067
no one with any sexual desires
will be touching it.

06:26.167 --> 06:28.800
And that is the Cyberguy
guarantee, right?

06:28.900 --> 06:30.067
Yes. For sure.

06:30.100 --> 06:31.700
100% guarantee that.

06:31.800 --> 06:35.900
Full disclosure,
Herman is a sexual person,

06:36.067 --> 06:39.067
but he will not be touching
your computer at any point.

06:39.167 --> 06:41.367
What does that mean,
"he's a sexual person"?

06:41.467 --> 06:46.367
Yeah, that means a sexual person is me.

06:46.467 --> 06:49.067
So we having some desires for looking

06:49.133 --> 06:51.700
at the picture, digging,
looking inside.

06:51.800 --> 06:55.067
So we're curious about what is inside.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.500
What's contained inside.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.400
It's a nude photos, videos, stuff.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.067
So he has those desires.

07:01.167 --> 07:02.433
But his... Other people don't.

07:02.533 --> 07:04.067
They don't.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.933
The people that will be repairing it.

07:06.067 --> 07:07.333
The first customer
was excited by the concept.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.333
So now an asexual is coming up.

07:14.433 --> 07:16.133
- Yes.
- Got you.

07:16.233 --> 07:17.933
But all our hard work
would be meaningless

07:18.067 --> 07:20.267
unless we could
actually execute the repair,

07:20.367 --> 07:24.267
so once the computer was safely
in the desexualized zone,

07:24.367 --> 07:26.367
Herman took his place
in his isolation booth,

07:26.467 --> 07:28.933
where he could hopefully guide
the repair process

07:29.067 --> 07:30.600
while the barrier prevented him

07:30.700 --> 07:32.533
from acting out his most carnal urges.

07:32.633 --> 07:37.200
Okay, so can you double-click
on Library folder?

07:37.300 --> 07:39.200
Okay, this is regular folders.

07:39.300 --> 07:42.833
Okay, we don't need... Okay. So...

07:42.933 --> 07:45.467
After 30 minutes,
the repair was going well.

07:45.567 --> 07:48.333
But then Herman said he needed
to use the bathroom.

07:48.433 --> 07:51.533
While it is scanning,
so I'm doing a break.

07:51.633 --> 07:53.300
- Okay.
- To the restroom.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.733
And that was a problem.

07:54.833 --> 07:56.700
The only path to the bathroom

07:56.800 --> 07:59.200
was directly through
the desexualized zone.

07:59.300 --> 08:03.533
So to prevent contamination,
I created a lockdown protocol.

08:03.633 --> 08:06.567
And it was about to get
its first real-world test.

08:06.667 --> 08:08.333
♪

08:08.433 --> 08:12.967
<i>Warning. Lockdown protocol activated.</i>

08:13.067 --> 08:16.167
Once the computer was safely
caged and padlocked,

08:16.267 --> 08:19.333
Herman was allowed to cross
through the desexualized zone.

08:19.433 --> 08:22.333
<i>Sexual intruder alert.</i>

08:22.433 --> 08:25.100
<i>Sexual intruder alert.</i>

08:25.200 --> 08:28.133
<i>Sexual intruder alert.</i>

08:28.233 --> 08:30.833
<i>Sexual intruder alert.</i>

08:30.933 --> 08:34.299
<i>Sexual intruder alert.</i>

08:34.400 --> 08:36.067
<i>Sexual intruder alert.</i>

08:36.167 --> 08:37.967
Okay, thank you guys.

08:38.067 --> 08:39.967
The lockdown protocol
went off without a hitch,

08:40.067 --> 08:42.467
and once they completed
their first repair,

08:42.567 --> 08:45.533
it was clear that Herman
was sold on the new service.

08:45.633 --> 08:49.400
Nobody touch or looking
or digging inside a computer.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.133
So they feel safe.

08:51.233 --> 08:53.533
And that meant customers
now had a place

08:53.633 --> 08:55.400
where they could feel comfortable

08:55.500 --> 08:57.467
handing over their computer
to a stranger.

08:57.567 --> 09:00.333
Will you be looking
at any of her private photos

09:00.433 --> 09:02.333
or personal videos or anything?

09:02.433 --> 09:03.833
No. No, it's...

09:03.933 --> 09:05.067
And why not?

09:05.167 --> 09:06.833
Well, it's part of privacy,

09:06.933 --> 09:09.467
and also just 'cause
I have no interest in it.

09:09.567 --> 09:10.633
Because?

09:10.733 --> 09:14.600
'Cause I'm asexual.

09:14.700 --> 09:17.700
So there you go.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.700
And please backup my music
and my photos.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.533
I did not back them up.

09:22.633 --> 09:24.400
Of course.

09:29.054 --> 09:31.375
In the olden days,
this woman would have been

09:31.531 --> 09:33.798
tied to a stake and burned alive.

09:33.898 --> 09:37.131
But today the only threat
facing LA based psychic

09:37.231 --> 09:39.898
Madam Dora is a lack of customers.

09:39.998 --> 09:42.898
I've placed ads before, and they...

09:42.998 --> 09:45.331
I haven't seen a lot of return
from them.

09:45.431 --> 09:47.231
It could be because her marketing

09:47.331 --> 09:50.031
was just too generic
to even be noticed.

09:50.131 --> 09:53.698
So I paid her a visit with an
idea for a brand-new campaign.

09:53.798 --> 09:56.331
The goal of advertising
should be to appeal

09:56.431 --> 09:57.531
to as many people as possible.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.298
Mm-hmm.

09:59.398 --> 10:01.431
But as a psychic,
you need to make people feel

10:01.531 --> 10:03.298
that you're speaking directly to them.

10:03.398 --> 10:04.864
Because that's the fantasy they have.

10:04.964 --> 10:05.442
Okay.

10:05.505 --> 10:07.731
They want to believe
you know something about them.

10:07.831 --> 10:09.364
Okay.

10:09.464 --> 10:10.898
So rather than advertising to everyone,

10:10.998 --> 10:12.731
I think it would be hugely beneficial

10:12.831 --> 10:16.231
if you targeted your campaign
to just one person:

10:16.331 --> 10:18.198
Maria Garcia.

10:18.298 --> 10:21.898
And Maria Garcia is...

10:21.998 --> 10:25.164
According to the Whitepages,
there are over 1,000 people

10:25.264 --> 10:28.298
named Maria Garcia
in Los Angeles alone.

10:28.398 --> 10:30.731
So if Madam Dora created an ad campaign

10:30.831 --> 10:32.731
targeting just those people,

10:32.831 --> 10:34.631
each Maria Garcia would believe

10:34.731 --> 10:37.198
the psychic was speaking
directly to her,

10:37.298 --> 10:38.864
practically guaranteeing that they'd

10:38.964 --> 10:41.164
call the number to schedule a reading.

10:41.264 --> 10:44.264
The plan: Turn every Maria Garcia in LA

10:44.364 --> 10:46.798
into a devoted customer for life.

10:46.898 --> 10:49.064
Never made it a habit of
looking through the Whitepages.

10:49.164 --> 10:53.498
Well, maybe that's where you
screwed up.

10:53.598 --> 10:55.964
Yeah, it does make sense.

10:56.064 --> 10:58.798
Madam Dora was impressed with
my good idea.

10:58.898 --> 11:01.698
Now all we had to do
was get the word out.

11:01.731 --> 11:04.298
So the next day, I returned
with some sound equipment

11:04.398 --> 11:07.064
so we could record a radio ad
for our new campaign.

11:07.164 --> 11:09.698
Maria Garcia, I had a vision about you.

11:09.731 --> 11:11.398
I need to speak to you.

11:11.498 --> 11:13.898
We also did an extensive print campaign

11:13.998 --> 11:16.898
and installed multiple
billboards at busy intersections

11:16.998 --> 11:19.031
throughout the city of Los Angeles.

11:19.131 --> 11:22.031
And within days, Dora had
received her first call.

11:22.131 --> 11:25.331
Hi, my name's Maria Garcia.

11:25.431 --> 11:27.531
So I had Madam Dora call her back

11:27.698 --> 11:29.493
to try to schedule a reading.

11:29.822 --> 11:31.289
- Hello?
- Hello.

11:31.389 --> 11:33.556
- Is this Maria Garcia?
- Yes.

11:33.656 --> 11:35.356
My name is Dora, I'm a psychic.

11:35.456 --> 11:36.956
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:37.056 --> 11:38.589
Say you had a vision about her.

11:38.689 --> 11:40.322
- Okay.
- I had a vision about you.

11:40.422 --> 11:42.156
- And it was a strong vision.
- Oh.

11:42.256 --> 11:43.589
And it was a really strong vision.

11:43.689 --> 11:44.856
It came to me in a dream.

11:44.956 --> 11:46.856
And it came to me in a dream.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.255
The ad campaign worked,

11:48.349 --> 11:51.289
and Maria booked an appointment
for later that week.

11:51.389 --> 11:52.889
My hope was that she'd be
impressed enough

11:52.989 --> 11:54.722
to become a devoted customer.

11:54.822 --> 11:56.556
So when she arrived
for her appointment,

11:56.656 --> 11:58.256
I told her we were
filming a documentary

11:58.356 --> 12:00.356
about the best psychics in the world,

12:00.456 --> 12:03.556
and she agreed to give me
an interview after her reading.

12:04.417 --> 12:06.556
But when she emerged 30 minutes later,

12:06.656 --> 12:08.189
I was shocked to discover

12:08.289 --> 12:09.756
that she was completely underwhelmed.

12:09.856 --> 12:11.722
She just said that she saw something

12:11.822 --> 12:14.822
about the law around me.

12:14.922 --> 12:16.556
Was that relevant or...

12:16.589 --> 12:18.956
I don't think it was, honestly.

12:19.056 --> 12:21.422
- Okay.
- Yeah, I was confused by that.

12:21.556 --> 12:22.688
This was bad.

12:22.805 --> 12:25.756
If Maria didn't believe
in Dora's psychic powers,

12:25.856 --> 12:27.556
we'd lose her as a customer

12:27.589 --> 12:30.022
and my whole plan would be a waste.

12:30.122 --> 12:31.889
But that's when I realized

12:31.989 --> 12:34.356
there might still be a way
to win her back.

12:34.456 --> 12:36.889
Maria said that Dora
had predicted a mystery man

12:36.989 --> 12:38.989
would soon sweep her off her feet.

12:39.089 --> 12:42.556
But I guess I'm gonna find a guy who

12:42.589 --> 12:46.089
I'm kind of turned away from at first,

12:46.189 --> 12:49.289
and I guess I'll see what happens.

12:49.389 --> 12:51.022
So if I could secretly engineer

12:51.122 --> 12:52.789
a way for this to happen,

12:52.889 --> 12:54.756
Maria would have no choice
but to believe

12:54.856 --> 12:58.056
that Dora's mystical
powers were for real.

12:58.156 --> 13:01.556
I thought I knew a mystery man
who just might fit the bill.

13:01.656 --> 13:03.822
One of the production
assistants on my show

13:03.922 --> 13:06.856
named Salomon regularly updates
his Facebook page

13:06.956 --> 13:10.789
with posts about his longing
for a romantic connection.

13:10.889 --> 13:12.122
It was clear he was still searching

13:12.222 --> 13:14.189
for that special someone.

13:14.289 --> 13:16.789
So I invited him into my office
to see if he wanted to help me

13:16.889 --> 13:21.022
bring a psychic's prediction to life.

13:22.922 --> 13:24.289
I told Salomon that I wanted
to introduce him

13:24.389 --> 13:25.322
to a young woman I knew.

13:25.422 --> 13:26.889
Her name's Maria Garcia.

13:26.989 --> 13:29.289
Yeah, she seems cute.

13:29.389 --> 13:30.922
And that a psychic had predicted

13:31.022 --> 13:32.789
she would soon fall in love.

13:32.889 --> 13:37.589
The man she described sounded
pretty similar to you.

13:37.689 --> 13:39.889
Similar?

13:39.989 --> 13:40.795
Yeah.

13:40.935 --> 13:43.789
Like she described a man with
brown hair, brown eyes.

13:43.889 --> 13:46.289
Wow. That's...

13:46.389 --> 13:48.556
That's pretty crazy.

13:50.022 --> 13:52.022
Those psychics.

13:52.122 --> 13:54.256
Salomon seemed interested,
but before setting them up,

13:54.356 --> 13:56.556
I wanted to be sure
they had the ingredients

13:56.589 --> 13:58.689
for a true romantic connection.

13:58.789 --> 14:01.022
Do you have any deal-breakers
I should know about?

14:01.122 --> 14:02.622
Deal-breakers?

14:02.722 --> 14:04.556
Like turnoffs or something.

14:04.656 --> 14:06.989
Uh, if they're not nice.

14:07.089 --> 14:08.389
If they're, like, mean.

14:08.556 --> 14:09.389
Okay.

14:09.556 --> 14:10.956
Yeah.

14:11.056 --> 14:12.256
'Cause some people like bad girls.

14:12.356 --> 14:13.422
Oh, no. Not me.

14:13.556 --> 14:14.589
- Right.
- No.

14:14.689 --> 14:17.722
I like them, uh... nice.

14:17.822 --> 14:18.756
Okay.

14:18.856 --> 14:20.029
Any other deal-breakers?

14:20.091 --> 14:22.556
Well, maybe a smoker.

14:22.589 --> 14:24.089
- Smoker?
- Yeah.

14:24.189 --> 14:26.156
So if she smokes, that's a turnoff?

14:26.256 --> 14:27.822
- Yes.
- Okay.

14:27.922 --> 14:29.556
Anything else?

14:29.656 --> 14:33.556
No smoker, and no handicapped.

14:33.589 --> 14:35.356
Handicapped?

14:35.456 --> 14:39.056
Well, since I never dated a
handicapped person.

14:39.156 --> 14:41.422
Like, I don't know. That would be...

14:41.556 --> 14:44.056
Well, what do you think would
be the problem about that?

14:44.156 --> 14:47.056
Uh, I guess if there's, like,
a set of stairs.

14:47.156 --> 14:50.356
You probably have to lift the
person or something.

14:50.456 --> 14:53.156
Like, I don't know.
You might, like, drop her.

14:53.256 --> 14:54.156
You know?

14:54.256 --> 14:55.356
She might sue you.

14:55.456 --> 14:56.822
- Right.
- Yeah, so...

14:56.922 --> 14:58.622
I don't want no... Nothing like that.

14:58.722 --> 15:01.122
So you don't want to date
a handicapped person

15:01.222 --> 15:04.089
because you're worried you'd
have to carry them up the stairs

15:04.189 --> 15:06.889
and then you'd fall and then
that person would sue you?

15:06.989 --> 15:08.022
Yeah, something like that.

15:08.122 --> 15:09.556
Yeah.

15:09.656 --> 15:11.122
I don't think she's handicapped,

15:11.222 --> 15:13.389
but I can check on the smoking thing.

15:13.556 --> 15:14.527
That would be good.

15:14.652 --> 15:16.585
Salomon was on board.

15:16.685 --> 15:18.919
But for this to work,
Maria would need to feel like

15:19.019 --> 15:21.019
it was a chance encounter.

15:21.119 --> 15:23.219
So I called her up and said that

15:23.252 --> 15:25.085
the documentary crew wanted
to do a follow-up interview

15:25.219 --> 15:27.285
about her experience with the psychic.

15:27.385 --> 15:28.819
Yeah, I can do that.

15:28.919 --> 15:30.019
Great.

15:30.119 --> 15:31.752
But what she didn't know

15:31.852 --> 15:33.719
was that the real purpose of the shoot

15:33.819 --> 15:35.619
was to give her and
Salomon a chance to connect.

15:35.719 --> 15:37.385
And I had the perfect way

15:37.485 --> 15:39.385
to give them some time alone together.

15:39.485 --> 15:40.619
Doing her makeup?

15:40.719 --> 15:42.585
Yeah.

15:42.685 --> 15:44.352
I don't even know how to put makeup.

15:44.452 --> 15:45.485
You've never done makeup before?

15:45.585 --> 15:47.419
No.

15:47.519 --> 15:49.219
Well, it's just like you
look at the color of her skin,

15:49.319 --> 15:50.719
and you try to match it and you
just put it on.

15:50.819 --> 15:52.952
It's easy.

15:53.052 --> 15:56.419
So many colors.

15:56.519 --> 15:59.819
Salomon agreed that posing as
the on-set makeup artist

15:59.919 --> 16:02.419
would give them the best chance
to get to know each other.

16:02.519 --> 16:04.019
But there was one big concern.

16:04.119 --> 16:05.485
Do you know how to flirt?

16:05.585 --> 16:06.785
I don't know.

16:06.885 --> 16:08.452
- You don't know?
- I don't.

16:08.552 --> 16:09.652
Okay, okay, so pretend you're the girl.

16:09.752 --> 16:11.019
- Okay?
- Okay.

16:11.119 --> 16:12.719
- And I'll be the guy...
- Okay.

16:12.819 --> 16:13.852
And I'll show you a little role-play.

16:13.952 --> 16:14.985
- Okay?
- Okay.

16:15.085 --> 16:18.085
So hey, how's it going?

16:18.219 --> 16:19.419
It's good.

16:19.519 --> 16:21.219
How's your day today?

16:21.285 --> 16:22.752
It's good.

16:22.852 --> 16:23.985
Why is it good?

16:24.085 --> 16:27.619
Oh, it's just the day is good.

16:27.719 --> 16:28.985
Nice day to go out.

16:29.085 --> 16:31.219
You're so dumb.

16:31.285 --> 16:32.419
That's funny.

16:32.519 --> 16:33.852
- So you see?
- Yeah.

16:33.952 --> 16:35.485
It's like you're insulting,

16:35.585 --> 16:37.985
but at the same time,
you don't mean it.

16:38.085 --> 16:40.752
Yeah, so that's a good example
of flirting.

16:40.852 --> 16:42.652
Salomon was a quick study.

16:42.752 --> 16:45.519
But for my plan to work,
he would need to seal the deal.

16:45.619 --> 16:48.552
Most importantly, though, if you
like her,

16:48.652 --> 16:50.752
don't be shy to ask her out.

16:50.852 --> 16:52.352
Think you can do that?

16:52.452 --> 16:55.685
I think I can do that.

16:56.067 --> 16:58.619
Before Maria arrived, I set Salomon up

16:58.719 --> 17:00.285
with a YouTube makeup tutorial

17:00.385 --> 17:02.352
so he could learn the basics.

17:02.452 --> 17:04.551
And then I just kind of
buff it all over the skin,

17:04.652 --> 17:05.618
really working it in there.

17:05.719 --> 17:07.285
And this stuff...

17:07.385 --> 17:08.551
And when she finally showed up,

17:08.652 --> 17:10.352
I greeted her at the door.

17:10.452 --> 17:12.285
So we're just gonna get you
into makeup quickly for,

17:12.385 --> 17:15.019
like, a touchup, and then
we'll do the interview.

17:15.118 --> 17:17.219
- Awesome.
- Okay, cool.

17:17.285 --> 17:19.219
Where do you want me for now?

17:19.285 --> 17:20.752
Oh, do you want a smoke?
Do you want a cigarette at all?

17:20.852 --> 17:21.952
Oh, no, I don't smoke.
Thank you, though.

17:22.051 --> 17:23.219
- You don't?
- No.

17:23.285 --> 17:24.385
Okay. That's cool.

17:24.484 --> 17:26.519
Okay.

17:26.618 --> 17:28.352
And with that, it was time for
Salomon and Maria to meet.

17:28.452 --> 17:31.052
So this is our makeup artist, Salomon.

17:31.219 --> 17:32.719
- Hi.
- Hello.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.285
- He'll be...
- I'm Maria; nice to meet you.

17:34.385 --> 17:36.219
- My name is Salomon.
- Uh-huh.

17:36.319 --> 17:38.385
All right, he'll be touching
you up before we begin.

17:38.485 --> 17:39.985
All right. I'll leave you two to it.

17:41.485 --> 17:45.352
So I'm just gonna remove the shine.

17:45.452 --> 17:47.952
- Just put a little bit...
- Mmhmm.

17:54.919 --> 17:56.219
Do you want me to move my hair back?

17:56.252 --> 17:57.819
Uh, yes.

17:57.919 --> 17:59.452
Sorry about that.

18:01.000 --> 18:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18:08.644 --> 18:11.852
So, um, so how is your day?

18:11.952 --> 18:14.219
It's good. It's good.

18:14.285 --> 18:16.752
It was really... It's relaxing so far.

18:16.852 --> 18:18.519
Oh, yeah. That's funny.

18:18.619 --> 18:19.719
You're so dumb.

18:19.819 --> 18:21.685
Okay.

18:21.785 --> 18:23.085
Yeah.

18:23.219 --> 18:25.885
Thank... So I'm...

18:25.985 --> 18:28.219
Done?

18:28.319 --> 18:30.652
So, um, let me see.

18:30.752 --> 18:32.885
Just gonna...

18:32.985 --> 18:36.685
Just gonna keep doing more shine.

18:36.785 --> 18:38.819
It was a rough start.

18:38.919 --> 18:40.519
And I was getting nervous
that Salomon wouldn't be able

18:40.619 --> 18:42.885
to make Dora's prediction come true.

18:42.985 --> 18:45.985
But then, things started
to turn around.

18:46.085 --> 18:48.519
What's your favorite movie?

18:48.619 --> 18:50.885
I don't know. That's a good question.

18:50.985 --> 18:52.619
I love horror movies, though.

18:52.719 --> 18:54.485
Oh, yeah, those are scary.

18:54.585 --> 18:56.485
That's what I love about it.

18:56.585 --> 18:59.385
I like the adrenaline rush
you get, like, during the film.

18:59.485 --> 19:02.819
And I like seeing, like, why,

19:02.919 --> 19:05.085
if it's, like, a killer,
like, what their motive is.

19:05.219 --> 19:06.685
- Oh, yeah.
- And, like, how they do it.

19:06.785 --> 19:08.285
It would be to have...
It would be good,

19:08.385 --> 19:09.785
I think, to have the remote control.

19:11.452 --> 19:12.752
It's like, you can escape the killer.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.219
- You just fast-forward.
- Yeah.

19:14.252 --> 19:15.819
Or just fast-forward the movie.

19:15.919 --> 19:18.119
To see the ending.

19:18.219 --> 19:20.585
Salomon was actually making her laugh.

19:20.685 --> 19:24.485
And they were able to bond over
a common interest: Movies.

19:24.585 --> 19:25.885
What other movies you like?

19:25.985 --> 19:27.752
Um...

19:27.852 --> 19:30.419
I want to watch all the
"Harry Potter" movies again,

19:30.519 --> 19:32.885
'cause I just started
reading the books.

19:32.985 --> 19:34.719
Oh, yeah, those are good. I like them.

19:34.819 --> 19:36.752
- Did you read the books?
- I haven't read the books.

19:36.852 --> 19:37.952
But I went to see the movies.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.752
Mm-hmm.

19:39.852 --> 19:40.785
That's easier.

19:42.385 --> 19:44.019
The books are really good, though.

19:44.119 --> 19:47.752
Yeah, so there you go.
That's good lipstick.

19:47.852 --> 19:49.619
Okay. Thank you so much.

19:49.719 --> 19:52.819
Oh, I want to know if
you want to go out with me.

19:52.919 --> 19:54.452
Huh?

19:54.552 --> 19:55.652
Out on a date?

19:55.752 --> 19:57.219
- On a date?
- Yes.

19:57.319 --> 20:00.419
- Okay.
- Yeah, so if...

20:00.519 --> 20:03.019
Um, I don't... I mean,
I'll hang out with you,

20:03.119 --> 20:05.019
but I don't know if it'd be,
like, a date,

20:05.119 --> 20:06.519
'cause I don't know you at all.

20:06.619 --> 20:09.452
Well, yeah, that would be good.

20:09.552 --> 20:10.819
I mean, that's how everything starts,

20:10.919 --> 20:12.019
- with friendship.
- Yeah.

20:12.119 --> 20:14.952
Yeah, so that's good.

20:15.052 --> 20:16.419
Yeah.

20:16.519 --> 20:17.619
So we get to know each other.

20:17.719 --> 20:18.785
Cool. Cool.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.885
Salomon had done it.

20:20.985 --> 20:23.185
And now that Madam Dora's
vision of a romantic encounter

20:23.285 --> 20:25.885
with a mystery man had come true,

20:25.985 --> 20:29.352
Maria seemed to have a newfound
faith in the psychic's powers.

20:29.452 --> 20:32.352
Do you think you might go back
to her for another appointment?

20:32.452 --> 20:34.652
Yeah, if I were ever to see a psychic,

20:34.752 --> 20:36.752
I feel, why not it be her?

20:36.852 --> 20:39.185
I know it may seem a bit like cheating,

20:39.285 --> 20:41.085
putting in all this work

20:41.185 --> 20:42.885
to make a psychic's prediction
come to life,

20:42.985 --> 20:45.952
but who's to say my intervention
wasn't exactly

20:46.052 --> 20:49.219
what Madam Dora had foreseen all along?

20:49.319 --> 20:51.719
I guess I'll never really
know the truth,

20:51.819 --> 20:55.019
but with a flood of new Marias
calling every single day,

20:55.119 --> 20:58.885
the one thing I did know was
that Dora would be just fine.

21:06.273 --> 21:11.305
<font color="#fff00">Corrected & Synced by Bakugan</font>

21:14.385 --> 21:15.819
- What is that warning?
- So...

21:15.919 --> 21:18.319
For Time Machine. For Time Machine.

21:18.419 --> 21:21.752
Says "Do you want to use Cyberguy

21:21.852 --> 21:23.752
to back up with Time Machine?"

21:23.852 --> 21:25.952
No.

21:26.052 --> 21:26.719
- Don't use?
- Don't use.
