where Milo can't find you,

30:30.829 --> 30:33.614

30:35.703 --> 30:38.924
- He can find me anywhere.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.714
- We're gonna have to get ahold
of somebody at WitPro.

30:46.714 --> 30:48.890
- She'll have to
give them something.

30:50.761 --> 30:52.285
- Yeah.

30:52.285 --> 30:55.810
Do you know any
of the names of your Johns?

30:55.810 --> 30:58.987
- I mean, there's some
celebrities that I know.

31:01.033 --> 31:03.165
Everyone knows their names,
but--

31:03.165 --> 31:07.604
- But you know faces?
- I know faces.

31:07.604 --> 31:10.477
- Okay.
You came from New York?

31:10.477 --> 31:12.131
- Mm-hmm.

31:12.131 --> 31:14.394
- Okay, look,
let's just print out photos

31:14.394 --> 31:18.311
of every New York congressman,
senator, police chief.

31:18.311 --> 31:21.009
Just everyone, right?

31:21.009 --> 31:23.316
We'll make some flashcards
for tomorrow.

31:23.316 --> 31:25.884

- She can stay on the couch.

31:27.668 --> 31:29.278
I'll stay in the office.

31:29.278 --> 31:31.193
- Okay.
I'm gonna head home.

31:31.193 --> 31:35.502
- Oh, no, no, I need you
to stay here with her.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.072
- You really don't trust me,
huh?

31:40.072 --> 31:42.596
- No.

31:42.596 --> 31:44.990
Not even a little bit.

32:01.180 --> 32:04.139
- Did you honestly think
I wouldn't find out?

32:11.538 --> 32:14.584
- Find out what?

32:18.762 --> 32:20.851
- "A local pizzeria

are you doing

33:06.854 --> 33:09.683
walking in here with a gun
on your hip and a badge,

33:09.683 --> 33:12.686
both of which should be in
your captain's desk drawer?

33:12.686 --> 33:16.124
- Mom, I am on admin,
but they need me working shifts

33:16.124 --> 33:17.778
because we're so understaffed.

33:17.778 --> 33:20.041
And it's a fucking war
out there.

33:20.041 --> 33:23.610

a fucking war out there.

33:23.610 --> 33:27.701
I teach the ones who lost.

33:27.701 --> 33:30.573

If you're just gonna sit here

You only talk that way
when you've been with Michael.

33:44.370 --> 33:48.765
- Oh, here we go.
- You know how dangerous he is.

33:48.765 --> 33:52.421
- Mom, I'm not having this
argument with you right now.

33:52.421 --> 33:56.208
Mike, he does a lot of good.
- Mike believes he does good,

33:56.208 --> 33:58.166
but he is a criminal.

33:58.166 --> 34:00.603
He's been a criminal
since he was in prison.

34:00.603 --> 34:03.780
He thinks like a criminal.
He acts like a criminal.

34:03.780 --> 34:06.044
And as much as he
tries to protect you,

34:06.044 --> 34:09.525
he will get you killed.

going back to New York.

46:31.310 --> 46:32.920
- Where's that asshole fed?

46:32.920 --> 46:35.270
- I don't know.
I think he went out front.

46:35.270 --> 46:37.055
- Shit.

46:37.055 --> 46:38.796
I need you to do
exactly what I say.

46:38.796 --> 46:42.669
Okay, I want you to stand up
and go out the front door.

46:49.894 --> 46:51.591
- All right.
- MIKE: Do you see him?

46:51.591 --> 46:54.072
- I don't see him.
- Do you see their cars?

46:55.595 --> 46:59.468
- Yeah, I see their car.

46:59.468 --> 47:01.035
Mike, you're scaring me.

47:01.035 --> 47:04.212
- Turn left and run.

47:04.212 --> 47:05.561
- Where am I running to?

47:05.561 --> 47:08.086
- Just fuckin' run!

47:13.178 --> 47:15.049
- [siren whoops]

47:37.289 --> 47:38.812
- Have you been in?

47:38.812 --> 47:40.683
- The bomb squad's doin'
an ultrasound at the door.

47:40.683 --> 47:42.511
We've got SWAT ready.
Just waitin' on the word.

47:42.511 --> 47:45.732
- Okay.
Anything?

47:45.732 --> 47:47.516
- It's not them.
No signs of a struggle.

47:47.516 --> 47:49.692
We've been calling your office.
We're calling their cells.

47:49.692 --> 47:51.781
They're not answering.

47:51.781 --> 47:54.088
- I don't know, Ian.
This is reckless.

47:54.088 --> 47:56.961
Milo's not reckless.

47:56.961 --> 47:59.702
I don't know what
he wants me to do here.

47:59.702 --> 48:02.009
I don't get it.
What warrants this?

48:02.009 --> 48:03.968
- Hey, Mike,
he's a fuckin' madman.

48:03.968 --> 48:06.100
- No, he's not, actually.
He's fuckin' evil, yeah.

48:06.100 --> 48:09.974
But he's not crazy.
He's fuckin' calculated.

48:09.974 --> 48:11.889
- SWAT's clear.
They're goin' in.

48:14.152 --> 48:16.067
- Here we go.

48:23.857 --> 48:25.598
- What is that?
What does that mean?

48:25.598 --> 48:26.381
- There's Robert, let's go.

48:26.381 --> 48:28.557

You just have to find it.
