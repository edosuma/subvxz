He owns a coral art gallery
in Waikiki.

07:17.255 --> 07:18.921
I've actually seen
some of his work.

07:18.923 --> 07:21.090
He goes in the ocean--
mostly Rock Piles surf break--

07:21.092 --> 07:22.458
and uncovers

07:22.460 --> 07:24.994
long lost items that have
been encrusted in coral

07:24.996 --> 07:26.762

Hey, don't pay any attention
to him, Max, okay?

07:32.370 --> 07:34.337
He's just mad that he didn't
listen to me when I told him

07:34.339 --> 07:36.072
to rent a separate apartment
for his nephew.

07:36.074 --> 07:37.273
I told him three times.
Oh...

07:37.275 --> 07:38.841
Are you gonna lend me
the money to do that?

07:38.843 --> 07:40.209
Huh? You know?
'Cause you know I don't have it.

07:40.211 --> 07:42.211

I didn't mean to snap at you.

07:43.314 --> 07:45.815
Your apology's accepted,
Detective.

07:45.817 --> 07:47.783
Go on, Max.
Oh, yes.

07:47.785 --> 07:49.952
Uh, well, a commercial
fishing boat, uh,

07:49.954 --> 07:51.654
discovered our victim.
floating in the ocean.

07:51.656 --> 07:54.056
A GSW to the chest.

07:54.058 --> 07:56.492
His kayak was recovered
by the coast guard.

07:56.494 --> 07:58.561
But unfortunately none
of his salvage items were in it.

07:58.563 --> 08:00.396
All right, so, uh,

08:00.398 --> 08:02.031
this guy finds something
he's not supposed to find.

08:02.033 --> 08:04.333
The killer takes it,
puts a bullet in him,

08:04.335 --> 08:06.602
and drops him, uh,
in the ocean.

08:06.604 --> 08:08.204
A good theory,
but highly unlikely.

08:08.206 --> 08:10.606
The shape and depth
of the entry wound

08:10.608 --> 08:13.609
suggests that the bullet
was traveling at an unusually

08:13.611 --> 08:15.444
slow trajectory
when entering the body.

08:15.446 --> 08:17.646
That, coupled with the fact
there was water in his lungs,

08:17.648 --> 08:19.815
would indicate
he was shot underwater.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.685
And there's also this.

08:22.687 --> 08:23.886
Oh, and who is that?

08:23.888 --> 08:25.454
That is
a John Doe murder,

08:25.456 --> 08:27.289
unsolved
from six weeks ago.

08:27.291 --> 08:29.358
His body washed up
at the Ala Moana Beach.

08:29.360 --> 08:30.659
What, you think
they're connected?

08:30.661 --> 08:31.594
Undoubtedly.

08:31.596 --> 08:33.229
The bullet that killed
Ben Lahinea

08:33.231 --> 08:34.797
was a direct ballistics match
to the slug

08:34.799 --> 08:36.799
that I recovered
from our John Doe.

08:36.801 --> 08:38.167
You're saying these two guys

08:38.169 --> 08:39.402
were killed with the same gun?

08:39.404 --> 08:40.635
That is correct,
gentlemen.

08:40.638 --> 08:43.572
Find the gun,
and you'll solve both murders.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.121

into it, Ani.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.389

to 50 cents a box?

09:04.394 --> 09:05.660
Can you afford that?

09:05.662 --> 09:07.629
Relax. I'm on the government
payroll now.

09:17.474 --> 09:18.807
is illegal in this country?

09:18.809 --> 09:20.341
He's not working.
He's a paid intern.

09:20.343 --> 09:22.277
What he learns from me
will benefit him

09:22.279 --> 09:24.712
in the workforce one day.

09:39.763 --> 09:41.196

09:41.198 --> 09:42.197

09:42.199 --> 09:43.998
Okay, anything I
can do for you?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.167
Well, since you brought it up,

09:46.169 --> 09:48.303
while I'm stoked you guys
finally came to your senses

09:48.305 --> 09:50.972
and brought me into the fold,
I was kind of thinking

09:50.974 --> 09:53.675
that I was gonna be upstairs,
you know, with the big boys.

09:53.677 --> 09:55.810
Yeah.
And girl.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.145
Right.

09:57.147 --> 09:58.847
Look, uh, I'm really
sorry about that.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.015
But space is actually
really tight upstairs.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.183
This is the best we can do.

10:02.185 --> 10:04.119
Okay, cool.

10:04.121 --> 10:06.421
Well, I'll make it work.

10:07.657 --> 10:09.791

10:09.793 --> 10:11.659

10:34.751 --> 10:36.184
No, we're not lost.

10:36.186 --> 10:37.585

10:37.587 --> 10:39.954
'Cause you got a look on

10:39.956 --> 10:41.923

the hell we're going.

10:41.925 --> 10:43.658
Catherine, man.

10:43.660 --> 10:45.660
Ah, that was gonna
be my next question.

10:45.662 --> 10:46.961
What happened?

10:46.963 --> 10:49.063
Well, I overhear her on the
phone this morning, all right?

10:49.065 --> 10:51.366
And she's talking
to somebody in Afghanistan.

10:51.368 --> 10:52.600
And you think
that she's what--

10:52.602 --> 10:55.570
maybe getting ready
to leave again?

10:55.572 --> 10:56.771
Yeah.

10:56.773 --> 10:58.540
I do.
Did she say that?

10:58.542 --> 11:00.542
No.

11:00.544 --> 11:01.509
I don't know.

11:01.511 --> 11:02.977
I mean, my Pashto's
a little rusty,

11:02.979 --> 11:05.780
but there was something
in her voice.

11:05.782 --> 11:07.215
Did you ask her about it?

11:07.217 --> 11:08.183
No.

11:08.185 --> 11:09.684
Of course
you didn't.

11:09.686 --> 11:10.885
You gotta ask her
about it, Steve.

11:10.887 --> 11:12.187
First things first.

11:12.189 --> 11:13.621
You gotta confront her
and see what's going on.

11:13.623 --> 11:15.290
Okay. And say what?
"Hey, honey.

11:15.292 --> 11:17.358
So I was listening
in on your phone call and..."

11:17.360 --> 11:18.826
You don't got to
worry about that.

11:18.828 --> 11:22.630
That phone call was a,
uh, house casualty.

11:22.632 --> 11:23.965
A "house casualty"?
Yeah.

11:23.967 --> 11:26.134
What is a "house casualty"?

11:26.136 --> 11:28.169
It means that it
happened in your house,

11:28.171 --> 11:29.637
so it's, you know,
everything's fair game.

11:29.639 --> 11:31.039
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

11:31.041 --> 11:32.407
Like, she made a call,
you just happened

11:32.409 --> 11:33.608
to overhear it.
Yeah, she's in my...

11:33.610 --> 11:34.776
I'm not eavesdropping.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.311
No.
It's my house.

11:36.313 --> 11:37.512
That's my point.

11:37.514 --> 11:40.014
It's a no-fault "violation"
of privacy. You see?

11:40.016 --> 11:41.249
She can't get upset about that.

11:41.251 --> 11:42.250
But still,

11:42.252 --> 11:43.918
if she's thinking of leaving,

11:43.920 --> 11:45.053
she must have her reasons.

11:45.055 --> 11:46.187
Yeah, but
it's a reason

11:46.189 --> 11:47.689
that I believe that
she should be sharing

11:47.691 --> 11:48.823
with the guy
that's potentially

11:48.825 --> 11:50.391
gonna ask her to marry him.
Well...

11:50.393 --> 11:51.926
I'm not doing that anymore.

11:51.928 --> 11:53.761
I can't ask her to marry me
if she's thinking of leaving.

11:53.763 --> 11:54.762
What am I, an idiot?

11:54.764 --> 11:57.699
Why is the glass
always half empty?

11:57.701 --> 11:59.334
What do you know
about that phone call?

11:59.336 --> 12:01.536
Maybe she was calling those
people that she helped out

12:01.538 --> 12:02.704
to see how
they're doing.

12:02.706 --> 12:04.105
Maybe she was saying
"happy birthday."

12:04.107 --> 12:05.840
You don't know
what that call was about.

12:05.842 --> 12:07.342
And what? You're just gonna
throw everything away

12:07.344 --> 12:09.477
behind a misunderstanding?
That's insane.

12:10.613 --> 12:12.647
Uh, you make a good point,
I guess.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.582
Of course I make a good
point, because I am not

12:14.584 --> 12:16.317
the type of person who
freaks out at the first sign

12:16.319 --> 12:18.119
of uncertainty.
No, you... no, you are not.

12:18.121 --> 12:19.988
Maybe I am that type of person.

12:19.990 --> 12:20.955
That's not the point.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.156
The point is this:

12:22.158 --> 12:23.691
Figure out what's going on,

12:23.693 --> 12:26.160
put a ring on the girl's finger
and that's that. Okay?

12:26.162 --> 12:28.029
Nahele picked it up today.

12:28.031 --> 12:29.130
That's good.

12:29.132 --> 12:31.032
Do not abort this mission,
do you understand me?

12:31.034 --> 12:32.800
Yes, sir.

12:34.236 --> 12:35.870
Here we are, buddy.
Rock Piles.

12:35.872 --> 12:37.572
This is where Ben Lahinea's wife
said he went diving.

12:37.574 --> 12:38.906
Why is it Rock Pi...

12:38.908 --> 12:40.408
I don't see any piles,
I don't see any rocks.

12:40.410 --> 12:43.811
Seriously, who names
these surf breaks anyways?

12:43.813 --> 12:45.213
We're in the middle
of the ocean.

12:45.215 --> 12:47.215
I don't see any signs.
Do you see any signs?

12:47.217 --> 12:48.683
Maybe we passed a sign,

12:48.685 --> 12:50.051
but I don't think so.

12:50.053 --> 12:51.319
I-I mean,
what's with this place?

12:51.321 --> 12:53.054
Everything's... every place
got to have a name?

12:53.056 --> 12:54.255
I'll tell you what.

12:54.257 --> 12:57.158
Why don't you contemplate
that for a second?

12:57.160 --> 12:58.493
I'll be right back.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.964
♪ ♪

13:32.761 --> 13:35.029
♪ ♪

13:43.105 --> 13:45.873
All right, so how'd
it go with Shioma?

13:45.875 --> 13:47.742
Did he believe you?
I don't know.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.010
But you know what?
He'd be crazy to think

13:49.012 --> 13:50.912
that you killed two of
his people outside your house.

13:52.282 --> 13:54.248
All right, so what's
our next move?

13:54.250 --> 13:55.917
Well, Shioma gave us
a week to find Gabriel

13:55.919 --> 13:57.785
and prove that he was
the one behind all this.

13:57.787 --> 13:59.387
We've been looking for
Gabriel a long time.

13:59.389 --> 14:00.621
What's another week?

14:00.623 --> 14:02.557
Well, it's more time than
we had this morning, right?

14:03.827 --> 14:05.860
Listen, Kono,

14:05.862 --> 14:07.729
we will find Gabriel.

14:07.731 --> 14:09.030
And we will get
Shioma his money back

14:09.032 --> 14:11.265
so you and Adam
can finally move forward.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.834
I promise you.

14:12.836 --> 14:14.936
Hey, guys.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.571
Hey, where
you going?

14:16.573 --> 14:18.840
I'm going to the crime lab.
You want to come with me?

14:18.842 --> 14:20.975
Isn't it Eric's first day?
It is.

14:20.977 --> 14:22.176
That's why I'd like you to come,

14:22.178 --> 14:24.579
so I don't punch him
in the mouth.

14:29.551 --> 14:30.685
Pretty sweet, huh?

14:30.687 --> 14:32.720
I've only been on
the gig a few hours

14:32.722 --> 14:34.021
and I'm already
at the center

14:34.023 --> 14:36.257
of an epic murder
investigation.

14:36.259 --> 14:37.592
I blame Stella.

14:37.594 --> 14:38.960
That's my sister.

14:38.962 --> 14:40.628
All right, Eric, why don't you
tell us what you have?

14:40.630 --> 14:42.230
Right. Most of
these items

14:42.232 --> 14:43.872
have a crazy amount
of porolithon buildup.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.470
It's a genus of coralline algae.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.372
It makes up the majority
of Hawaiian reef structures.

14:51.374 --> 14:54.275
Also, it grows very quickly
over hard surfaces,

14:54.277 --> 14:57.779
leaving a thin layer
of coral-like crust.

14:57.781 --> 14:58.880
Impressive, right?

14:58.882 --> 15:00.148
Yeah, it's impressive.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.849
Um, but if I were you,
I would maybe, um,

15:01.851 --> 15:03.451
ease back on
the energy drinks

15:03.453 --> 15:04.852
and just bring it
down a notch.

15:04.854 --> 15:05.787
Just 'cause there's
people around, you know?

15:05.789 --> 15:07.455
Right.

15:07.457 --> 15:09.123
Porolithon.
It grows at a rate of

15:09.125 --> 15:10.525
three millimeters a month,
give or take.

15:10.527 --> 15:11.626
So most of these items

15:11.628 --> 15:13.261
have been under the water
way over a year.

15:13.263 --> 15:15.196
However, the gun
and the keys

15:15.198 --> 15:17.165
have significantly
less buildup.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.300
My calculations put
them under the water

15:19.302 --> 15:21.569
the same amount of time--
about six weeks.

15:21.571 --> 15:22.937
Uh-huh. All right.

15:22.939 --> 15:25.139
Our John Doe washed up
on shore six weeks ago.

15:25.141 --> 15:26.574
Okay. So whoever
the killer is

15:26.576 --> 15:29.277
dumps the body, gun and the keys
in the water at the same time.

15:29.279 --> 15:30.645
Right. And these things
stay there

15:30.647 --> 15:32.180
<i>until Ben Lahinea finds them</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

15:32.182 --> 15:33.648
<i>Lahinea's bag</i>

15:33.650 --> 15:34.749
has a tear in it.

15:34.751 --> 15:35.883
I mean, the gun
could have slipped out

15:35.885 --> 15:37.985
<i>and accidentally discharged.</i>

15:41.290 --> 15:42.957
Okay.

15:42.959 --> 15:45.726
That's a decent theory
explaining Lahinea's death,

15:45.728 --> 15:48.095
but it does not tell us
who killed our John Doe.

15:48.097 --> 15:49.597
Ah...

15:49.599 --> 15:51.332
I can maybe help
you out with that.

15:51.334 --> 15:53.468
You don't have to raise
your hand, you can just talk.

15:53.470 --> 15:55.436
All right. Well, the
revolver's serial number's

15:55.438 --> 15:56.838
completely
scratched off.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.039
Illegible.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.240
But...

15:59.242 --> 16:01.275
I could probably lift it
if you give me some time.

16:01.277 --> 16:03.644
Well, it's pretty bad.

16:03.646 --> 16:04.979
You can do that?

16:04.981 --> 16:06.614
Sugar lips, a little
hydrochloric acid

16:06.616 --> 16:08.483
and crystalline chloride,
I can do anything.

16:08.485 --> 16:09.684
Except breathe

16:09.686 --> 16:11.052
with a busted nose, okay?

16:11.054 --> 16:12.286
Do not call her
"sugar lips." Ever.

16:12.288 --> 16:14.088
Got it. Less caffeine,
tone down the misogyny.

16:14.090 --> 16:15.156
I'm all over it.

16:15.158 --> 16:16.891
Let us know if you find
something, please.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.059
All right!

16:21.498 --> 16:23.130
Look at that.

16:24.733 --> 16:25.867
Nahele, I really appreciate

16:25.869 --> 16:27.568
you picking this up
for me today, all right?

16:27.570 --> 16:28.836
<i>'A 'ole pilikia.</i>

16:28.838 --> 16:30.371
I mean, it don't seem too right

16:30.373 --> 16:32.440
to spend all that money
on an allotrope of carbon.

16:32.442 --> 16:34.442
An allotrope of carbon?

16:34.444 --> 16:36.511
Glad you haven't been
ditching your science class.

16:36.513 --> 16:38.746
I mean, look, you could spend
all that money on a new truck.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.414
Yes, I could.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.150
But, uh, I wouldn't trade
what I got for anything.

16:43.152 --> 16:45.786
Before you go all mushy on me,
I'm gonna get outta here.

16:45.788 --> 16:48.222
You'll know what I'm talking
about one day, buddy.

16:48.224 --> 16:50.625
And here I thought
you were a car guy.

16:50.627 --> 16:51.893
Later, Commander.

16:53.662 --> 16:56.430
Hey, all right,
so we...

16:56.432 --> 16:58.633
What was that you put
under your arm, there?

16:58.635 --> 17:00.401
Does it...
Is that the thing?

17:00.403 --> 17:01.569
Is this the thing?

17:01.571 --> 17:02.770
It's <i>a</i> thing.

17:02.772 --> 17:03.871
Well, you gonna let me see it?

17:03.873 --> 17:05.106
Yeah, sure.
You can see it.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.540
All right.
Look at you.

17:06.542 --> 17:08.009
Look at that!

17:08.011 --> 17:10.144
Catherine is
gonna love this.

17:10.146 --> 17:12.613
Too bad she's gonna have
to wait to get it, though.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.248
What are you talking about?

17:14.250 --> 17:15.383
I just got off
with the crime lab.

17:15.385 --> 17:17.251
Eric managed to get
a serial number

17:17.252 --> 17:18.752
off the murder weapon.

17:18.755 --> 17:20.354
The gun is registered
to Eddie Brooks.

17:20.356 --> 17:21.521
He manages a gun range

17:21.523 --> 17:22.790
in Koko Head.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.759
Look, I already told you
I didn't kill anyone.

17:24.761 --> 17:25.826
We know.

17:25.828 --> 17:26.993
Your alibi checked out.

17:26.996 --> 17:28.128
So you're gonna
let me outta here?

17:28.131 --> 17:29.163
No.

17:29.165 --> 17:30.298
No, you see,
it's amazing

17:30.300 --> 17:31.532
what we can learn

17:31.534 --> 17:32.833
by doing a simple
background check.

17:32.835 --> 17:34.835
For instance, that you
bought 15 guns this year.

17:34.837 --> 17:37.038
And I have a permit
for every one of them.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.006
There's no crime
in being a collector.

17:39.008 --> 17:40.107
That's true.

17:40.109 --> 17:42.743
But see, then we had HPD
toss your place

17:42.745 --> 17:44.812
and they didn't find one gun.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.180
Now, don't you find that
a little strange

17:46.182 --> 17:47.481
for a gun collector,
Eddie?

17:47.483 --> 17:48.816
You see, Eddie,

17:48.818 --> 17:50.384
you're what we call
a straw man.

17:50.386 --> 17:52.353
You buy guns and you
sell them to people

17:52.355 --> 17:53.754
who can't get them
for themselves.

17:53.756 --> 17:55.423
And one of those guns
was used in a murder,

17:55.425 --> 17:56.524
which makes you
an accessory.

17:56.526 --> 17:57.758
And for that,

17:57.760 --> 18:00.595
you're going to prison,
Mr. Second Amendment.

18:00.597 --> 18:02.129
Unless, of course,
you want to cooperate

18:02.131 --> 18:04.599
with your two new
best friends, here.

18:05.434 --> 18:07.435
What do you want to know?

18:07.437 --> 18:08.436
Everything.

18:08.438 --> 18:09.637
Who'd you sell
this gun to?

18:09.639 --> 18:11.172
I don't remember.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.374
Look, people pay cash,
I don't keep a log.

18:13.376 --> 18:14.609
That's too bad,

18:14.611 --> 18:17.778
because this gun you sold
killed two men.

18:17.780 --> 18:20.314
Now you got
two choices:

18:20.316 --> 18:22.650
either you tell us who
you sold that gun to,

18:22.652 --> 18:23.784
or you're going into a box.

18:23.786 --> 18:25.086
Wait, wait.

18:25.088 --> 18:26.187
That's the guy.

18:26.189 --> 18:27.588
That's the guy
I sold that gun to.

18:27.590 --> 18:29.290
You sure about that?
Positive.

18:29.292 --> 18:31.959
His name's Miko Mosley.

18:33.228 --> 18:35.162
<i>Look at this mess.</i>

18:35.164 --> 18:36.564
<i>Must be, uh,</i>

18:36.566 --> 18:38.366
must be the maid's day off.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.937
Whoa. Check this out.

18:42.939 --> 18:45.706
Couple paintings
here by, um...

18:45.708 --> 18:47.642
well, some artist
I can't pronounce.

18:47.644 --> 18:48.876
These things are worth
100 grand a pop.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.344
You believe it?

18:50.346 --> 18:51.779
Miko's got expensive taste.

18:51.781 --> 18:54.181
I'll run 'em through

18:54.183 --> 18:57.351
HPD Burglary
and Theft and NCIC.

18:57.353 --> 18:58.686
See what we get.

19:02.791 --> 19:03.991
Damn.

19:04.826 --> 19:06.293
Whew.

19:06.295 --> 19:07.862
I don't get it.

19:07.864 --> 19:08.829
This guy, he's living

19:08.831 --> 19:09.897
like a homeless person,

19:09.899 --> 19:11.132
but he's rolling
like Mayweather.

19:11.134 --> 19:12.933
Well, you know what they say--

19:12.935 --> 19:14.902
better to look good
than to live good.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.204
Who says that?

19:17.206 --> 19:19.640
Me.

19:19.642 --> 19:21.275
Find anything
else out there?

19:21.277 --> 19:24.512
Yeah. More evidence of money
this man doesn't have.

19:24.514 --> 19:27.081
Hey, Lou, come here
for a minute.

19:32.821 --> 19:36.424
This brother got
his own ATM machine.

19:36.426 --> 19:37.858
I mean,
he's printing money.

19:37.860 --> 19:39.360
He's bleaching the ink off ones,

19:39.362 --> 19:41.595
and he's turning them
into hundreds.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.364
He was playing a part.

19:43.366 --> 19:45.599
He bought all these expensive
clothes, a bunch of artwork,

19:45.601 --> 19:47.068
got himself a gun.

19:47.070 --> 19:50.604
I think Miko Mosley was trying
to impress somebody.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.406
Well, maybe that somebody
didn't buy into his ruse

19:52.408 --> 19:54.742
and put a bullet
in his head.

20:16.487 --> 20:17.820
Hey.

20:17.822 --> 20:19.389
Hey, Danny.

20:19.391 --> 20:21.057
Thanks for coming out
to meet me.

20:21.059 --> 20:22.258
No problem.

20:22.260 --> 20:23.626
Yeah.
Good to see you.

20:23.628 --> 20:24.861
You, too.

20:24.863 --> 20:25.928
Is everything all right?

20:25.930 --> 20:26.896
Yeah, everything's good.

20:26.898 --> 20:29.098
I just thought we should
have a conversation.

20:30.434 --> 20:32.135
Okay.

20:32.137 --> 20:33.736
Uh...

20:33.738 --> 20:35.004
Nice view.

20:35.006 --> 20:37.440
Oh, come on, bring it.

20:37.442 --> 20:38.808
Just bring it.

20:38.810 --> 20:42.512
Steve has been very happy
since you've been back.

20:42.514 --> 20:44.080
Me, too.
That's good,

20:44.082 --> 20:46.048
'cause I think that
that's what he likes,

20:46.050 --> 20:47.583
when you are happy here,
you know?

20:47.585 --> 20:49.852
I am.

20:49.854 --> 20:51.587
Then don't leave again.

20:56.193 --> 20:58.761
Where did that come from?

20:58.763 --> 21:00.296
I... Does Steve know
that you're here right now?

21:00.298 --> 21:01.297
No, he does not,

21:01.299 --> 21:02.698
and he would kill me if he did,

21:02.700 --> 21:04.100
so please don't tell him.

21:04.102 --> 21:05.234
Okay.

21:05.236 --> 21:06.536
Catherine,

21:06.538 --> 21:09.338
I'm just looking out
for my boy, all right?

21:09.340 --> 21:12.708
When you left last time,
he was hurt, pretty bad.

21:12.710 --> 21:14.710
Okay? He walked around trying
to pretend like he wasn't,

21:14.712 --> 21:15.878
but I could see it.

21:15.880 --> 21:16.879
He was suffering.

21:16.881 --> 21:18.648
You know,
you don't walk away

21:18.650 --> 21:21.317
from the kind of relationship
that the two of you had.

21:21.319 --> 21:23.920
The relationship
that you <i>have.</i>

21:25.756 --> 21:28.291
Look, I didn't mean
to hurt him, Danny.

21:28.293 --> 21:30.927
Steve understood why
I had to stay behind

21:30.929 --> 21:32.195
in Afghanistan.

21:32.197 --> 21:34.730
He knew that that was
really important to me.

21:34.732 --> 21:36.132
I know
he understood it.

21:36.134 --> 21:38.367
That does not mean that
it didn't wreck him, you know?

21:38.369 --> 21:40.503
Yeah.

21:40.505 --> 21:42.338
Look, I-I have no idea

21:42.340 --> 21:44.373
what he was like
before I met him,

21:44.375 --> 21:45.708
but I can tell you now

21:45.710 --> 21:47.777
that he is the best
version of himself

21:47.779 --> 21:49.278
when you are around.

21:52.249 --> 21:53.749
You're a good friend, Danny.

21:53.751 --> 21:55.117
Well, if it wasn't me
standing here,

21:55.119 --> 21:57.320
it'd be Chin,
it'd be Lou, it'd be Kono.

21:57.322 --> 21:59.755
Look, the point is this,
all right?

21:59.757 --> 22:01.858
Last couple years,

22:01.860 --> 22:03.125
he's been through a lot,

22:03.127 --> 22:05.795
and I just, I just think
he deserves to be happy.

22:07.130 --> 22:09.565
I know, I know.

22:09.567 --> 22:11.868
So that's why I'm here.

22:11.870 --> 22:16.272
That's why I'm asking-- are you
gonna stick around for good?

22:18.642 --> 22:22.345
There is nothing
that I want more.

22:22.347 --> 22:24.013
That is fantastic news.
Come on.

22:34.358 --> 22:36.292
<i>So Chin's got everyone working</i>

22:36.294 --> 22:37.727
on finding Gabriel, all right?

22:37.729 --> 22:39.462
So trust me, Adam.

22:39.464 --> 22:42.064
It's a small island--
he'll resurface.

22:42.066 --> 22:43.799
Okay.

22:43.801 --> 22:46.903
Oh, uh, I got to go,
so I'll see you tonight?

22:46.905 --> 22:48.104
Okay.

22:48.106 --> 22:49.305
Love you.

22:50.775 --> 22:52.408
Ball and chain, huh?

22:52.410 --> 22:54.176
Um...

22:54.178 --> 22:55.978
It's cool, we don't
got to talk about it.

22:55.980 --> 22:57.246
Me, I'm not getting
married till I'm 50.

22:57.248 --> 22:58.781
You know, Clooney style.

22:58.783 --> 23:00.283
Slay 'em when I'm young,
I'll settle down when I'm old.

23:00.285 --> 23:03.219
Right, yeah, 'cause you and
Clooney have so much in common.

23:04.889 --> 23:06.622
Burn. Nice.

23:09.661 --> 23:12.061
Okay.

23:12.063 --> 23:14.397
Uh, anyway, I, uh,
did a comparison

23:14.399 --> 23:16.399
on those keys that were
dumped in the ocean,

23:16.401 --> 23:18.067
and I was able
to figure out the types.

23:18.069 --> 23:21.037
Padlock, boat key,
house key.

23:21.039 --> 23:22.371
Okay, great.

23:22.373 --> 23:24.574
Miko washed up on shore,

23:24.576 --> 23:26.909
so the killer could have used
a boat to dump the body,

23:26.911 --> 23:28.778
and somehow the keys
ended up in the water.

23:28.780 --> 23:30.112
Yeah, if that's
the case, though,

23:30.114 --> 23:31.380
how'd your killer get
back to shore?

23:31.382 --> 23:33.115
He could have
had a spare set.

23:33.117 --> 23:35.217
Either way, let's focus
on the boat key.

23:35.219 --> 23:36.361
See if you can find
a make and a model.

23:36.385 --> 23:37.254
Easy.

23:37.255 --> 23:38.588
Great.

23:38.590 --> 23:39.822
Uh, actually,
Officer Kalakaua,

23:39.824 --> 23:41.557
there's another reason
I called you down here.

23:41.559 --> 23:42.992
Yeah, what is it?

23:42.994 --> 23:45.027
Uh, one of the items in Ben
Lahinea's bag was a GoPro.

23:45.029 --> 23:47.430
Now, judging by the coral
and the degradation,

23:47.432 --> 23:49.131
this thing's been in the ocean
more than a year,

23:49.133 --> 23:50.633
but I was able to
recover some footage.

23:50.635 --> 23:52.935
Now, my uncle says
you're a surfer,

23:52.937 --> 23:55.871
so I was kind of hoping maybe
you can help me I.D. this guy.

24:01.878 --> 24:03.713
Oh, you know him.

24:03.715 --> 24:06.749
Yeah, his name is Eli Hoku.

24:06.751 --> 24:08.784
We used to surf
Pipeline together.

24:08.786 --> 24:10.620
Last year he was
chasing a south swell,

24:10.622 --> 24:13.923
and, uh, he drowned near a break
called Rock Piles.

24:13.925 --> 24:15.491
I'm sorry.

24:17.828 --> 24:20.630
This must have been
taken the day he died.

24:20.632 --> 24:22.965
Uh, do me a favor--
make me a copy of this?

24:22.967 --> 24:24.567
Yeah, you got it.
Okay.

24:24.569 --> 24:25.835
Good job. Thanks.

24:30.907 --> 24:34.176
All right, so the background
check on Miko came back clean,

24:34.178 --> 24:35.645
although he did have
some serious debt.

24:35.647 --> 24:37.680
Yeah, we ran
his credit cards.

24:37.682 --> 24:39.615
It turns out he tried to
rent in Kahala six weeks ago

24:39.617 --> 24:43.185
using an online rental service,
but his card was declined.

24:43.187 --> 24:46.322
So we contacted the owner,
a guy named Philip Kanae.

24:46.324 --> 24:49.392
Now, Kanae agrees to rent him
the house for cash.

24:49.394 --> 24:51.093
Place went for $5,000 a week.

24:51.095 --> 24:52.294
Okay, but Miko's broke.

24:52.296 --> 24:54.130
So he goes and prints
some money to pay for it.

24:54.132 --> 24:55.331
What if Kanae found out?

24:55.333 --> 24:57.099
Right, and he kills Miko
with is own gun,

24:57.101 --> 24:59.301
and then put some distance
between himself

24:59.303 --> 25:00.469
and the murder weapon.

25:00.471 --> 25:03.372
Airline tickets show
he left Hawaii last month.

25:03.374 --> 25:04.640
Just got back a few days ago.

25:04.642 --> 25:06.242
Could have been laying low
until things settled down.

25:06.244 --> 25:09.245
How do we find him?
All right, I got two addresses for him.

25:10.147 --> 25:11.847
We got the rental property
in Kahala,

25:11.849 --> 25:13.683
and we got a permanent address
in Diamond Head.

25:13.685 --> 25:15.951
Okay, fine, Danny and I'll go
to Diamond Head,

25:15.953 --> 25:18.320
see if we can find Kanae,
have a little chat.

25:18.322 --> 25:19.855
You guys go
to the rental property,

25:19.857 --> 25:21.157
see if you can
find anything

25:21.159 --> 25:23.726
that links Kanae to the murder
of Miko Mosley.

25:29.266 --> 25:31.133
Philip Kanae.

25:59.930 --> 26:01.363
Clear.

26:01.365 --> 26:02.298
Clear.

26:02.300 --> 26:03.499
Clear.

26:03.501 --> 26:05.534
Clear.

26:05.536 --> 26:08.204
Whoa, Danny,
take a look at this.

26:09.573 --> 26:12.007
Look at that--
Perv TV.

26:13.110 --> 26:14.176
Hey, Steve.

26:14.178 --> 26:15.211
Hey, Chin.

26:15.213 --> 26:16.846
Turn around.

26:16.848 --> 26:19.048
Now look up.

26:20.884 --> 26:21.851
Cheese.

26:21.853 --> 26:23.552
Any sign of Kanae there?

26:23.554 --> 26:24.553
No, place is empty. You?

26:24.555 --> 26:25.621
No, same here.

26:25.623 --> 26:26.555
I'll check it out.

26:26.557 --> 26:28.891
Listen, contact HPD,

26:28.893 --> 26:30.893
have 'em put an APB out
on this guy, okay?

26:30.895 --> 26:33.262
If he didn't kill Miko,
maybe he saw who did.

26:33.264 --> 26:34.864
Think you can forget that APB.

26:42.773 --> 26:45.040
That Kanae?

26:46.376 --> 26:48.577
Yeah.

26:58.262 --> 27:00.763
Your victim has a fractured
skull and broken kneecaps,

27:00.765 --> 27:02.498
along with multiple
contusions across his body.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.934
All right, so he was beaten
to death, thrown in the pool.

27:04.936 --> 27:06.269
What about TOD?

27:06.271 --> 27:07.971
Well, liver temperature
indicates

27:07.973 --> 27:09.172
approximately 72 hours ago.

27:09.174 --> 27:11.274
Hey, guys. Damn.

27:11.276 --> 27:13.776
Somebody Tony Soprano-ed the
hell out of this guy, huh?

27:14.812 --> 27:16.679
Eric.

27:16.681 --> 27:18.181
<i>Ho'omaika'i 'Ana.</i>

27:19.650 --> 27:21.417
It means, "Congratulations."

27:21.419 --> 27:23.419
I totally knew that.

27:23.421 --> 27:25.922
Well, I am positive
that nepotism had

27:25.924 --> 27:27.023
nothing to do with the hire.

27:27.025 --> 27:29.392
Thanks, Max... I think.

27:29.394 --> 27:31.094
What the hell is he talking about?
It doesn't matter.

27:31.096 --> 27:32.829
This is the part where you
tell us why you are here.

27:32.831 --> 27:34.163
Right.

27:34.165 --> 27:35.665
I found something
on Kanae's laptop.

27:35.667 --> 27:38.901
Lead the way.

27:38.903 --> 27:40.536
All right, so I've been
going through the files,

27:40.538 --> 27:42.572
and it turns out Kanae has been
recording all of his renters.

27:42.574 --> 27:45.174
Now, I'm talking everything,
and I mean everything.

27:45.176 --> 27:46.909
Everything, huh?
Yeah.

27:46.911 --> 27:49.312
Except someone recently
went through all the files

27:49.314 --> 27:52.015
and deleted a day's worth of
footage from six weeks ago.

27:52.017 --> 27:54.584
Six weeks ago, that's when
Miko was renting the place.

27:54.586 --> 27:57.320
Right, so Kanae witnesses Miko's
murder, the killer finds out,

27:57.322 --> 27:59.655
decides to get rid of all the
evidence, including Kanae.

27:59.657 --> 28:01.324
Yeah, but why wait until now
to baby seal him?

28:01.326 --> 28:03.092
Eric.
What? Too graphic?

28:03.094 --> 28:05.028
I mean, it's
inappropriate.

28:05.030 --> 28:06.729
You see, he's right
there, all right?

28:06.731 --> 28:08.664
I got it; you're right,
I got it, all right?

28:08.666 --> 28:11.401
The question still stands--
why kill him now?

28:11.403 --> 28:12.735
Because he just got
back into town.

28:12.737 --> 28:14.070
Right.

28:14.072 --> 28:16.005
We need that
deleted footage.

28:16.007 --> 28:17.273
Can you do that?
Right.

28:17.275 --> 28:19.876
Does Kim Kardashian sleep
on her stomach?

28:19.878 --> 28:20.877
Okay.

28:20.879 --> 28:22.478
Danny, you got to help him.

28:22.480 --> 28:25.181
Buddy, you're
an HR nightmare, okay?

28:25.183 --> 28:27.450
Stop.
Sorry, Uncle D.

28:27.452 --> 28:28.818
And don't call me "Uncle,"
don't call me "D."

28:28.820 --> 28:29.786
Not in public, okay?

28:29.788 --> 28:30.853
Okay, you got it.

28:30.855 --> 28:32.155
Don't bow to me,
don't do any...

28:32.157 --> 28:33.990
Just relax.

28:36.260 --> 28:38.194
All right, lunch is served.

28:38.196 --> 28:42.932
My newest culinary achievement
about to debut on my new menu--

28:42.934 --> 28:45.501
shrimp pot pie.

28:47.671 --> 28:49.305
What the heck is this place?

28:49.307 --> 28:50.640
Pretty nice, huh?

28:50.642 --> 28:53.910
You gave up a cush gig
working at my shrimp truck

28:53.912 --> 28:58.381
with ocean and other views
for this dungeon.

28:58.383 --> 29:00.650
Well, first of all, I didn't
give up my gig working for you.

29:00.652 --> 29:02.185
I just scaled it
back to part-time.

29:02.187 --> 29:05.154
And secondly, don't let
appearances deceive you.

29:05.156 --> 29:07.023
Five-O values my input.

29:07.025 --> 29:08.357
I smell bleach.

29:08.359 --> 29:10.693
Yeah, I think it used to
be a janitor's closet.

29:10.695 --> 29:11.928
And no windows.

29:11.930 --> 29:14.931
You could lose track of time
down here, bruddah.

29:14.933 --> 29:16.966
Like Caesars Palace
on the ninth island.

29:16.968 --> 29:20.603
I was thinking more like
Batcave, but whatever.

29:20.605 --> 29:23.473
Anyway, thanks for stopping
by and bringing me lunch.

29:23.475 --> 29:25.541
Uh, it's very
thoughtful of you.

29:25.543 --> 29:27.009
Well, you owe me $6.50, Batman.

29:27.011 --> 29:28.644
You're charging me?

29:28.646 --> 29:30.079
But I still work for you.

29:30.081 --> 29:31.781
Half the time, half the price.

29:31.783 --> 29:34.283
And you know I only accept cash.

29:34.285 --> 29:36.252
ay, time
to get to work, Jer.

29:36.254 --> 29:37.320
Sweet.

29:37.322 --> 29:38.287
What's up, Chin?

29:38.289 --> 29:39.388
Oh, howzit?

29:39.390 --> 29:40.723
I was just
leaving anyway.

29:40.725 --> 29:42.758
This place got me feeling
claustrophobic...

29:42.760 --> 29:44.093
and a little unsettled.

29:44.095 --> 29:45.461
Laters.

29:45.463 --> 29:47.864
What's the case, boss?

29:47.866 --> 29:49.799
So, crime lab restored

29:49.801 --> 29:52.835
over 24 hours of deleted video
footage of a potential murder...

29:52.837 --> 29:54.837
Yeah, it was all me.

29:55.873 --> 29:57.039
I'm sorry, I'm...

29:57.041 --> 29:59.041
This is Eric Russo;
he's our new lab tech.

29:59.043 --> 30:01.077
He's also Detective
Williams' nephew.

30:01.079 --> 30:03.479
Oh, cool.

30:03.481 --> 30:05.515
Well, I need the two
of you to work together

30:05.517 --> 30:06.916
and comb through
that footage

30:06.918 --> 30:08.484
and see if there's any
connection to our murder.

30:08.486 --> 30:09.852
Can do.

30:09.854 --> 30:12.188
All right.

30:12.190 --> 30:14.524
Hey, how you doing?

30:14.526 --> 30:16.159
Who are you exactly?

30:16.161 --> 30:17.727
Jerry Ortega,

30:17.729 --> 30:20.663
special consultant, Five-O.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.568
God, that feels good to say.

30:34.244 --> 30:38.147
Hey, so the boat key that you
found in Lahinea's bag

30:38.149 --> 30:41.284
traced back to a 2002
Strike 35 fishing boat.

30:41.286 --> 30:44.220
Seven are registered on Oahu,
I cleared six of the owners.

30:44.222 --> 30:45.621
What about the seventh?

30:45.623 --> 30:48.257
It's registered to a
questionable shell corporation.

30:48.259 --> 30:50.226
The owner is Aaron James.

30:50.228 --> 30:52.228
He was arrested
for drug trafficking,

30:52.230 --> 30:53.596
but the charges were
dropped last year.

30:53.598 --> 30:54.931
All right,
so this is the one.

30:54.933 --> 30:56.132
Okay.

31:05.108 --> 31:06.776
It doesn't fit.

31:06.778 --> 31:08.511
Sorry, Steve.

31:08.513 --> 31:10.179
Must not be
the right one.

31:10.181 --> 31:11.814
I don't know about that.

31:11.816 --> 31:14.016
You said this boat's
13 years old?

31:14.018 --> 31:15.751
Yeah.

31:15.753 --> 31:17.887
That's a brand-new
ignition.

31:38.275 --> 31:40.042
I got blood.

31:40.044 --> 31:41.744
Okay.

31:41.746 --> 31:44.413
So sometime during the body
dump, our killer loses his keys,

31:44.415 --> 31:46.415
and he has to improvise
to get back to shore.

31:46.417 --> 31:47.750
Right, he doesn't
realize it,

31:47.752 --> 31:49.185
but he has the
vic's blood on him

31:49.187 --> 31:51.220
when he goes to
hot-wire the engine.

31:51.222 --> 31:53.823
Okay.

31:54.891 --> 31:56.259
Boss.

31:56.261 --> 31:57.960
Aaron James!

31:57.962 --> 31:58.928
Excuse me, sir?

31:58.930 --> 32:02.198
Mind if we have
a word with you?

32:10.441 --> 32:12.041
Hey! Hey!

32:13.844 --> 32:15.311
Kono!

33:07.618 --> 33:10.520
You can stay quiet
all you want, Aaron,

33:10.521 --> 33:12.154
but we know that you
dumped Miko's body

33:12.156 --> 33:13.923
and we know
you killed Philip Kanae.

33:13.925 --> 33:16.125
Like I said, I want my lawyer.

33:18.662 --> 33:20.296
Okay, have HPD
transport this guy

33:20.298 --> 33:22.731
to lockup.
What about my lawyer?

33:22.733 --> 33:24.500
I'll make sure you get a cell
with a window in it,

33:24.502 --> 33:25.901
so you can call for him.

33:27.971 --> 33:29.672
Now I don't feel so bad.

33:29.674 --> 33:32.274
I forgot how depressing
that room was compared to mine.

33:32.276 --> 33:33.709
Jerry, I'm kind of busy.
Oh, yeah, about that--

33:33.711 --> 33:36.045
did he tell you what happened?
No, not yet.

33:36.047 --> 33:37.179
Well, I think I can.

33:37.181 --> 33:39.114
<i>Check him.</i>

33:39.116 --> 33:40.616
Look, man...

33:40.618 --> 33:41.917
it's all good.

33:41.919 --> 33:43.886
Yeah, we'll see.

33:47.057 --> 33:48.457
What did I tell you? No guns.

33:48.459 --> 33:49.591
It's a precaution.

33:49.593 --> 33:51.060
Show me the cash.

34:05.875 --> 34:07.676
Ooh, hoo, hoo!

34:07.678 --> 34:09.178
Looks right to me.

34:12.148 --> 34:13.614
We good?

34:13.617 --> 34:15.250
These bills aren't real.

34:15.252 --> 34:16.752
Big mistake, pal.

34:19.922 --> 34:22.091
And that pretty much
tells the story.

34:22.092 --> 34:23.759
So Kanae gets back into town,

34:23.761 --> 34:26.195
he checks the footage
from his rental,

34:26.197 --> 34:27.929
he witnesses Aaron kill Miko.

34:27.931 --> 34:29.697
But instead of
reporting it to police,

34:29.699 --> 34:31.065
Kanae decides to blackmail him.
Yeah.

34:31.068 --> 34:32.467
And we got the evidence
to prove it.

34:32.469 --> 34:33.768
We found
text messages

34:33.771 --> 34:34.937
between Kanae
and Aaron James.

34:34.938 --> 34:37.072
Looks like they were
setting up a time

34:37.074 --> 34:38.639
to meet at
Kapiolani Park.

34:38.641 --> 34:40.309
All right. Somewhere,
Aaron changes his mind,

34:40.311 --> 34:41.744
goes to the house
in Diamond Head,

34:41.746 --> 34:43.178
kills him and
erases the video.

34:43.179 --> 34:44.346
Don't forget the cliffhanger.

34:44.348 --> 34:45.781
What cliffhanger?

34:45.783 --> 34:47.416
Every good story has a new
dilemma for its heroes,

34:47.418 --> 34:48.617
this included. Watch.

34:51.755 --> 34:52.721
Yeah, it's me.

34:52.723 --> 34:55.090
The buyer didn't pan out.

34:55.092 --> 34:56.859
I took care of him.

34:56.860 --> 34:58.861
Voilà.
Your cliffhanger.

34:58.863 --> 35:00.629
Looks like Aaron's
working for someone.

35:00.631 --> 35:02.731
Right, but clearly he's scared
of whoever it is.

35:02.733 --> 35:03.899
That's why he wouldn't talk.

35:03.901 --> 35:05.334
All right, so we'll just
go have a chat with him

35:05.336 --> 35:06.435
after he gets through booking.

35:06.437 --> 35:07.703
All right.
In the meantime,

35:07.705 --> 35:08.837
I'll pull Aaron's
cell phone records.

35:08.839 --> 35:10.105
Maybe we can
get us a hit

35:10.107 --> 35:11.974
on who he was calling
in that video.

35:11.976 --> 35:13.709
God, I love this table.

35:16.479 --> 35:17.346
What's up, Lou?

35:17.348 --> 35:18.614
That was Duke.

35:18.616 --> 35:21.717
Somebody hit the HPD transport
with Aaron aboard.

35:21.719 --> 35:23.218
They killed two officers
and extracted him.

35:23.220 --> 35:24.386
