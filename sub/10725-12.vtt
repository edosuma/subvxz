WEBVTT

00:00.988 --> 00:03.487
Over 68 million Americans

00:03.488 --> 00:05.407
leave the safety of
our borders every year.

00:05.408 --> 00:06.907
If danger strikes,

00:06.908 --> 00:09.157
the FBI's international response team

00:09.158 --> 00:11.508
is called into action.

00:36.828 --> 00:38.537
I can't believe we're doing this!

00:38.538 --> 00:39.538
Hell, yeah, we are!

00:39.539 --> 00:40.537
This is crazy!

00:40.538 --> 00:42.577
Dude, you'll be fine. Just keep running.

00:42.578 --> 00:44.747
Remember, you fall,
don't try and get up.

00:44.748 --> 00:46.867
Curl into a fetal
position, protect your head.

00:46.868 --> 00:48.947
You do not want to be eye
level with those horns.

00:48.948 --> 00:50.211
They're singing for protection,

00:50.212 --> 00:51.787
asking the saints to keep us safe.

00:51.788 --> 00:53.947
- How cool is that?
- All right, all right.

00:53.948 --> 00:56.617
- It's 2 minutes till 8:00.
- Lew here.

00:56.618 --> 00:58.577
With Clint and Kev,

00:58.578 --> 01:00.077
getting set to test ourselves

01:00.078 --> 01:03.577
against the mighty
Toros bravos of Pamplona!

01:03.578 --> 01:07.077
That we just found out
run at 35 miles per hour.

01:07.078 --> 01:08.867
Kev thinks we should have gone to Vegas.

01:08.868 --> 01:10.657
But Clint here wanted
to celebrate his 40th

01:10.658 --> 01:11.827
by cheating death itself.

01:11.828 --> 01:13.787
Come on, you love it! Mwah!

01:18.578 --> 01:20.947
This is it! The bulls are loose!

01:20.948 --> 01:23.197
If we get split up, let's
regroup behind that cafe

01:23.198 --> 01:26.468
we had breakfast at,
okay? Behind the cafe!

01:41.828 --> 01:44.287
Hell, yeah!

01:44.288 --> 01:46.718
Whoo! What a rush!

01:51.368 --> 01:53.048
Ugh!

01:55.578 --> 01:58.947
Ronaldo is the best player
in the world right now.

01:58.948 --> 02:01.367
I don't know. Messi's a genius,

02:01.368 --> 02:02.697
and he's adorable.

02:02.698 --> 02:04.481
Athletes should not be
described as adorable.

02:04.482 --> 02:06.907
Oh, well, I don't
remember you being bothered

02:06.908 --> 02:08.947
when somebody called
you something similar

02:08.948 --> 02:10.327
in the "men of the FBI" calendar.

02:10.328 --> 02:11.787
That was for charity.

02:11.788 --> 02:13.787
W-wait a minute, when was this?

02:13.788 --> 02:15.947
That was last year. Jack was Mr. July.

02:15.948 --> 02:17.323
No.

02:17.324 --> 02:18.697
One word... fireworks.

02:20.369 --> 02:22.037
No.

02:22.038 --> 02:23.798
Duty calls.

02:27.078 --> 02:29.077
Let's get everyone up to speed, Monty.

02:29.078 --> 02:30.617
Kaixo. Okay, two days ago,

02:30.618 --> 02:32.077
Clint Smith, a lawyer from Seattle,

02:32.078 --> 02:33.537
went missing in Pamplona.

02:33.538 --> 02:35.077
He had traveled to Spain to take part

02:35.078 --> 02:36.861
in the running of the
bulls and disappeared

02:36.862 --> 02:38.367
shortly after his first bull run.

02:38.368 --> 02:40.407
His friends, Americans Lew Donovan

02:40.408 --> 02:42.487
and Kevin Garcia reported him missing

02:42.488 --> 02:44.747
when he failed to return
after the race that morning.

02:44.748 --> 02:47.037
Then yesterday, Clint Smith's ears,

02:47.038 --> 02:50.117
and only his ears, were found severed

02:50.118 --> 02:52.907
in Vasconia Plaza inside the old city.

02:52.908 --> 02:54.033
Why ears?

02:54.034 --> 02:55.157
Could be symbolic.

02:55.158 --> 02:56.947
Maybe our unsub wants to be heard.

02:56.948 --> 02:58.577
Or maybe it's a scare tactic.

02:58.578 --> 03:01.037
Terrorist groups have been
known to cut off ears, noses,

03:01.038 --> 03:02.537
and lips just to make a statement,

03:02.538 --> 03:04.860
- you know, incite fear.
- What about the rest of his body?

03:04.861 --> 03:06.117
It hasn't been found.

03:06.118 --> 03:08.101
Monty ran the M.O. Through
Interpol and got a hit.

03:08.102 --> 03:09.747
Okay, this time last year,

03:09.748 --> 03:12.117
the ears of three Australian citizens

03:12.118 --> 03:13.827
were found scattered across Pamplona.

03:13.828 --> 03:15.617
All three had traveled to Spain

03:15.618 --> 03:17.321
to take part in the
running of the bulls.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.077
Six months later, their partial remains

03:19.078 --> 03:21.367
were found scattered
outside of the city limits.

03:21.368 --> 03:24.037
U.S. embassy wants us on
the ground immediately.

03:24.038 --> 03:26.221
Is there any connection
between the Australian victims?

03:26.222 --> 03:27.947
None that local P.D. can tell.

03:27.948 --> 03:29.451
They were taken every couple of days

03:29.452 --> 03:30.947
in different locations and times,

03:30.948 --> 03:34.037
and their ears were left
at three distinct landmarks.

03:34.038 --> 03:36.907
Didn't Don Quixote have his ear
cut off by a Basque traveler?

03:36.908 --> 03:39.037
He was wounded after his battle

03:39.038 --> 03:41.348
with the famous windmills of La Mancha.

03:42.658 --> 03:44.447
I saw the movie.

03:44.448 --> 03:47.117
This says the ears were left
at famous Basque landmarks.

03:47.118 --> 03:49.117
Pamplona is part of
the kingdom of Navarre,

03:49.118 --> 03:50.327
land of the Basques.

03:50.328 --> 03:51.747
Given the history, maybe our unsub

03:51.748 --> 03:53.331
is trying to make a political statement?

03:53.332 --> 03:56.157
So, we need to determine
whether these attacks are part

03:56.158 --> 03:57.577
of a larger political agenda,

03:57.578 --> 04:00.077
or the work of a disturbed individual.

04:00.078 --> 04:01.657
Well, either way, if the pattern holds,

04:01.658 --> 04:03.947
the unsub will strike again, soon.

04:03.948 --> 04:06.487
And with more Americans in
Pamplona than ever before,

04:06.488 --> 04:08.928
it's our job to stop him before he does.

04:10.616 --> 04:13.700
_

04:15.919 --> 04:16.918
_

04:19.327 --> 04:20.447
Don't!

"Too much sanity may be madness,

04:52.205 --> 04:54.624
and the maddest of all,
to see life as it is

04:54.625 --> 04:57.664
and not as it should
be"... Miguel de Cervantes.

05:01.666 --> 05:03.455
There's something like a million people

05:03.456 --> 05:05.455
that descend on Pamplona
during this week.

05:05.456 --> 05:07.375
They run the bulls every day.

05:07.376 --> 05:11.415
They have parades and
bullfighting, fireworks.

05:11.416 --> 05:13.835
Hemingway described it
as a "furious energy."

05:13.836 --> 05:16.205
An expression of the ephemeral.

05:16.206 --> 05:19.745
Life and the death and the
fleeting moments in between.

05:19.746 --> 05:22.375
Benjamin Esposito. You
must be Agent Garrett.

05:22.376 --> 05:23.311
That's right.

05:23.312 --> 05:24.245
Welcome to Pamplona.

05:24.246 --> 05:25.835
Thank you. This is my team.

05:25.836 --> 05:28.165
Agent Seger. Agent Simmons.

05:28.166 --> 05:28.811
And Jarvis.

05:28.812 --> 05:29.455
Hi.

05:29.456 --> 05:30.915
Thanks for your cooperation.

05:30.916 --> 05:33.745
I was the lead detective
on the case last year,

05:33.746 --> 05:35.785
and I have been dreading
this day ever since.

05:35.786 --> 05:38.455
I knew a criminal this
twisted would strike again.

05:38.456 --> 05:40.915
They usually do, but if
we can build a profile

05:40.916 --> 05:42.625
in conjunction with
the physical evidence,

05:42.626 --> 05:44.705
we have a good shot at catching him.

05:44.706 --> 05:48.415
As you can imagine, an event
like this is a huge boost

05:48.416 --> 05:49.875
to the local economy.

05:49.876 --> 05:51.415
Because of this, my superiors

05:51.416 --> 05:53.245
have asked to keep low profiles

05:53.246 --> 05:56.335
so as not to cause any alarm.

05:56.336 --> 05:58.785
Por favor.

05:58.786 --> 06:00.575
So, what can you tell us about

06:00.576 --> 06:02.245
your initial investigation?

06:02.246 --> 06:04.035
Well, the three sets of ears belonging

06:04.036 --> 06:05.625
to the Australian citizens

06:05.626 --> 06:07.035
didn't leave us much to go on.

06:07.036 --> 06:09.375
Witnesses proved unreliable.

06:09.376 --> 06:12.875
The case went cold.

06:12.876 --> 06:14.705
This way.

06:14.706 --> 06:17.415
And you found remains for
each of the Australians?

06:17.416 --> 06:19.875
Yes. The bodies were dismembered

06:19.876 --> 06:22.455
and found washed up in
a ditch off the highway.

06:22.456 --> 06:24.455
The ears of both the
first Australian victim

06:24.456 --> 06:26.415
and American Clint
Smith were dumped here

06:26.416 --> 06:28.375
in the same spot in
this courtyard, yeah?

06:28.376 --> 06:30.125
Here, Vasconia Plaza.

06:30.126 --> 06:32.495
That's home to an
important Basque memorial.

06:32.496 --> 06:34.245
Yes, Basque nationalists

06:34.246 --> 06:36.745
have a history of trying
to co-op the fiesta.

06:36.746 --> 06:39.705
We have seen large-scale
demonstrations, intimidation,

06:39.706 --> 06:41.375
and on some occasions, violence.

06:41.376 --> 06:44.335
Much like the U.K. and
the Irish Republican Army,

06:44.336 --> 06:46.319
you've been dealing with
these issues for decades.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.625
Last year, there were whispers

06:47.626 --> 06:50.245
that these attacks were part
of a larger Basque agenda,

06:50.246 --> 06:52.335
but no one is taking credit.

06:52.336 --> 06:55.335
Simmons, let's take advantage
of the extensive media coverage

06:55.336 --> 06:56.955
and review the festival footage.

06:56.956 --> 06:59.335
We need to find Clint's
last known location.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.245
I'll talk to Clint's
friends, Lew and Kevin.

07:01.246 --> 07:04.125
Great. Mae, take a look
at the forensic evidence.

07:04.126 --> 07:06.285
The ears. Got it.

07:06.286 --> 07:09.665
Detective, we need to surveil
the two previous disposal sites.

07:09.666 --> 07:12.745
It's likely the attacker
or attackers will revisit.

07:12.746 --> 07:14.785
We've got officers
monitoring the grounds.

07:14.786 --> 07:16.165
I'd like to view the memorial

07:16.166 --> 07:18.205
where Clint Smith's ears were found.

07:18.206 --> 07:19.556
I can take you there.

07:25.936 --> 07:27.583
_

07:28.428 --> 07:29.428
_

07:31.045 --> 07:32.045
_

07:34.974 --> 07:35.974
_

07:37.549 --> 07:38.549
_

07:46.321 --> 07:49.280
_

07:53.626 --> 07:54.936
ÿMijo?

08:07.246 --> 08:09.726
The ears were found right here.

08:12.786 --> 08:14.875
Were your men able to dust for prints?

08:14.876 --> 08:17.335
Well, the festival brings a
lot of additional foot traffic,

08:17.336 --> 08:20.165
so we've had trouble
pulling anything conclusive.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.995
The day the ears were found,

08:21.996 --> 08:23.875
there was a lot of people everywhere.

08:23.876 --> 08:26.495
The crowds were buying
a sense of anonymity

08:26.496 --> 08:28.875
that would allow the unsub
to move around freely.

08:28.876 --> 08:32.245
There was a riot in '78 that
took place in this Plaza.

08:32.246 --> 08:34.205
A Basque man was struck
by the authorities,

08:34.206 --> 08:35.875
violence erupted.

08:35.876 --> 08:38.495
They had to cancel the fiesta that year.

08:38.496 --> 08:41.125
This memorial is a call for peace.

08:41.126 --> 08:42.995
So, our killer knows his history.

08:42.996 --> 08:45.995
Maybe he feels his statements
are falling on deaf ears.

08:45.996 --> 08:49.806
If this is about politics,
why attack turistas?

08:52.076 --> 08:53.206
Maybe he blames them.

08:53.207 --> 08:54.335
For what?

08:54.336 --> 08:57.335
Distracting from the true
meaning of San Fermín.

08:57.336 --> 08:58.665
At its heart, the festival

08:58.666 --> 09:00.835
is a religious celebration, correct?

09:00.836 --> 09:03.665
Yes. It is a way for us
to honor and give thanks

09:03.666 --> 09:06.665
to the patron son of
Pamplona, San Fermín.

09:06.666 --> 09:08.455
Who found the ears?

09:08.456 --> 09:11.955
Father Consolmango. Two days ago.

09:22.404 --> 09:23.409
_

09:23.774 --> 09:26.577
_

09:26.996 --> 09:28.955
I am Father Consolmango.

09:28.956 --> 09:30.785
Father.

09:30.786 --> 09:33.335
Detective Esposito
said that you're the one

09:33.336 --> 09:34.955
who found the remains.

09:34.956 --> 09:36.125
Yes.

09:36.126 --> 09:40.835
A strange thing, this
removal of the ears.

09:40.836 --> 09:42.995
You have a pretty good
view of the memorial.

09:42.996 --> 09:44.955
What can you recall about
the moments leading up

09:44.956 --> 09:46.705
to your discovery?

09:46.706 --> 09:48.665
It was morning.

09:48.666 --> 09:52.125
I went outside and
spotted them in the...

09:52.126 --> 09:53.705
In the Plaza.

09:53.706 --> 09:56.205
Have you seen anything
or anyone suspicious

09:56.206 --> 09:59.335
in the last few days?

09:59.336 --> 10:01.995
I have heard of many bad deeds

10:01.996 --> 10:03.955
done in these eight days.

10:03.956 --> 10:07.556
But I have not witnessed
anything myself.

10:13.956 --> 10:16.835
Detective Esposito and I
are trying to stop a killer

10:16.836 --> 10:20.375
and save the life of an innocent man.

10:20.376 --> 10:22.075
If you know something,

10:22.076 --> 10:24.955
you'd be serving the cause of justice.

10:24.956 --> 10:26.665
I'm sorry.

10:26.666 --> 10:28.835
I cannot be of more help.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.285
Excuse me.

10:30.286 --> 10:32.335
I have a mass to prepare for.

10:32.336 --> 10:33.311
Buenos días.

10:33.312 --> 10:34.386
Gracias.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.285
He knows something he isn't saying.

10:38.286 --> 10:40.455
The Father made it clear.
He didn't see anything.

10:40.456 --> 10:42.745
He said he's heard of many bad deeds,

10:42.746 --> 10:44.915
maybe in confidence or via confession.

10:44.916 --> 10:48.035
That is a sacred boundary. I mean,

10:48.036 --> 10:51.075
how often do you think killers
confess to their priests?

10:51.076 --> 10:52.455
If our unsub did confess,

10:52.456 --> 10:54.415
it would say something about him.

10:54.416 --> 10:57.075
That he feels guilty?

10:57.076 --> 10:59.705
This is España, a catholic country.

10:59.706 --> 11:01.705
Guilt is a way of life.

11:01.706 --> 11:04.125
Yes, but for a violent
offender like this,

11:04.126 --> 11:07.245
it's a contradiction,
one we need to understand.

11:07.246 --> 11:10.285
Father Consolmango would
never violate his oath,

11:10.286 --> 11:13.125
and he's under no obligation to do it,

11:13.126 --> 11:16.226
so we need to pursue
other lines of inquiry.

11:21.836 --> 11:24.165
The Spanish should be
ashamed of themselves, man.

11:24.166 --> 11:28.165
All this talk of this festival
honoring the bulls is bull.

11:28.166 --> 11:30.189
These people are just
concerned with how much money

11:30.190 --> 11:31.955
they're gonna make.
It's so commercialized.

11:31.956 --> 11:34.495
Get some "b" roll. I'll
catch up with you later.

11:34.496 --> 11:35.094
Mm-hmm.

11:35.422 --> 11:37.955
_

11:38.114 --> 11:40.236
_

11:45.666 --> 11:50.125
Well, it looks like they
were sliced cleanly, one cut.

11:50.126 --> 11:53.785
Lack of hesitancy speaks
to our killer's resolve.

11:53.786 --> 11:56.205
Do you have the report on the
ears that we found last year?

11:56.206 --> 11:57.285
We have the ears.

11:57.286 --> 11:59.176
Oh, great. Can I take a look?

12:05.166 --> 12:07.035
Based on the cut itself,
i would venture to say

12:07.036 --> 12:10.125
that these were done
with a small, curved blade

12:10.126 --> 12:13.125
like a hunting knife or a paring knife.

12:13.126 --> 12:15.575
That is what we thought, as well.

12:15.576 --> 12:18.285
Let's see if these stick in the pattern.

12:18.286 --> 12:20.705
So, how long have you been working here?

12:20.706 --> 12:22.785
I've been producing a
local television coverage

12:22.786 --> 12:24.285
for almost a decade now.

12:24.286 --> 12:25.705
Oh.

12:25.706 --> 12:27.786
I have to say that the
running of the bulls has to be

12:27.787 --> 12:29.890
one of the most photographed
spectacles in the world.

12:29.891 --> 12:33.785
It's a great advertisement
for the city itself.

12:33.786 --> 12:36.205
Yeah, I'm pretty sure ESPN rolls tape

12:36.206 --> 12:38.516
on a guy getting gored
almost every year.

12:40.996 --> 12:42.665
San Fermín is to Spain

12:42.666 --> 12:44.995
what Mardi Gras is to your New Orleans.

12:44.996 --> 12:47.535
A never-ending party fueled
by equal parts adrenaline

12:47.536 --> 12:49.035
and sangria.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.495
I pulled up some locations

12:50.496 --> 12:52.955
based on the information you provided.

12:52.956 --> 12:55.335
Yeah, this looks like the spot.

12:55.336 --> 12:58.205
Can you blow it up?

12:58.206 --> 13:02.785
This is the San Francis
Xavier cathedral and fountain.

13:02.786 --> 13:07.455
Stupid Guiri should know better
than to urinate on a church.

13:07.456 --> 13:09.995
That's Clint. Freeze it there.

13:09.996 --> 13:12.205
He's got a lot of nerve
to do something like that.

13:12.206 --> 13:13.709
Can you get me a screen grab on that?

13:13.710 --> 13:15.375
Yes, of course.

13:15.376 --> 13:17.165
Hey.

13:17.166 --> 13:20.125
I think I may have something.

13:20.126 --> 13:22.326
So, we know our Australian
victims have little in common

13:22.327 --> 13:24.390
with each other, and even
less in common with Clint?

13:24.391 --> 13:25.835
So, it got me thinking,

13:25.836 --> 13:28.285
what if our victims were chosen
not because of who they are,

13:28.286 --> 13:29.705
but because of something they did?

13:29.706 --> 13:31.375
Maybe without even realizing it.

13:31.376 --> 13:32.995
Clint relieved himself in the fountain

13:32.996 --> 13:34.915
of a very famous cathedral.

13:34.916 --> 13:36.796
Pretty easy to see how
that could upset someone.

13:36.797 --> 13:38.700
There's no shortage of
bad behavior around here.

13:38.701 --> 13:40.221
To the locals, it must be infuriating.

13:40.222 --> 13:42.325
If Clint was attacked because
if he offended someone,

13:42.326 --> 13:44.415
maybe our previous victims
caused offense, as well.

13:44.416 --> 13:46.165
But would that make them the target

13:46.166 --> 13:47.625
of Basque nationalists?

13:47.626 --> 13:48.605
Not likely.

13:48.605 --> 13:50.234
Plus, if this is the
work of a political group,

13:50.235 --> 13:52.315
someone would have came
forward, taken credit by now.

13:52.316 --> 13:53.739
You're right. This isn't political.

13:53.740 --> 13:55.064
These people are being punished.

13:55.065 --> 13:56.564
Victimology here is key.

13:56.565 --> 13:57.934
Simmons, see if you can get access

13:57.935 --> 13:59.974
to the festival's video archives.

13:59.975 --> 14:01.558
I'll have Monty run the Australian vics

14:01.559 --> 14:02.774
through his fancy program.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.535
If the act of offense
is the unsub's trigger,

14:04.536 --> 14:06.999
do we think their transgressions
would be the same as Clint's?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.184
We need to look for patterns.

14:08.185 --> 14:09.737
Excuse me.

14:09.738 --> 14:12.814
And we need to see if Clint
or any of the previous victims

14:12.815 --> 14:15.604
have crossed paths with
any of the same locals.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.205
His friends couldn't
give me any details,

14:17.206 --> 14:18.205
so it's worth a look.

14:18.206 --> 14:20.524
Yeah, I'll get Monty up to speed.

14:20.525 --> 14:22.184
With so little evidence,

14:22.185 --> 14:24.894
we need to reduce the
potential victim pool.

14:24.895 --> 14:27.354
Yes, this is IRT Unit
Chief Jack Garrett.

14:27.355 --> 14:29.684
I need you to connect me
with the American ambassador

14:29.685 --> 14:31.564
in Madrid.

14:31.565 --> 14:33.108
State department's not gonna be happy.

14:33.109 --> 14:34.894
Nor detective Esposito,

14:34.895 --> 14:36.734
but we need to issue a travel alert

14:36.735 --> 14:38.734
to all Americans in the area.

14:38.735 --> 14:42.575
Charles, we have a situation.

14:45.144 --> 14:47.287
_

14:49.323 --> 14:52.992
_

14:55.587 --> 14:56.587
_

15:00.654 --> 15:03.603
Detective Esposito says that
his men didn't see anything.

15:03.623 --> 15:05.372
They responded to the screams

15:05.373 --> 15:08.322
when a couple of
tourists noticed the ears.

15:08.322 --> 15:09.847
This way.

15:09.848 --> 15:11.371
Thank you.

15:11.372 --> 15:14.241
Now he's taken a second victim.

15:14.242 --> 15:16.951
Well, he sure knows how to blend in.

15:16.952 --> 15:18.991
Cops nearby, clergy.

15:18.992 --> 15:22.081
He's taking a risk being here.

15:22.082 --> 15:23.991
Yeah, it speaks to his compulsion.

15:23.992 --> 15:26.121
Okay, so unlike before,

15:26.122 --> 15:28.491
when our unsub displayed
the Australian's ears

15:28.492 --> 15:30.321
just down the street near City Hall,

15:30.322 --> 15:32.241
these were left right

15:32.242 --> 15:34.411
in the inside of San Fermín Cathedral.

15:34.412 --> 15:36.451
I got to say, dropping ears

15:36.452 --> 15:37.911
at the doorstep of the patron saint

15:37.912 --> 15:39.321
feels pretty darn symbolic.

15:39.322 --> 15:41.321
No kidding, but is it an offering

15:41.322 --> 15:42.781
or a form of defiance?

15:42.782 --> 15:45.031
The way that they're
presented like this,

15:45.032 --> 15:47.491
out in the open, it makes
me think it's the latter.

15:47.492 --> 15:50.701
It's certainly a bold statement.

15:50.702 --> 15:53.661
Based on the angle of
excision on the edges,

15:53.662 --> 15:55.911
I can say that our unsub
definitely used the same knife.

15:55.912 --> 15:57.911
So, according to our theory, do we think

15:57.912 --> 16:00.741
this victim also defamed
the church in some way?

16:00.742 --> 16:04.241
Maybe he offended good
old Saint Fermín himself?

16:04.242 --> 16:07.531
Or maybe our unsub has appointed himself

16:07.532 --> 16:09.531
the new patron Saint of Pamplona,

16:09.532 --> 16:11.842
and these are just a
form of consecration?

16:15.372 --> 16:17.201
When I asked you to keep this quiet,

16:17.202 --> 16:19.661
issuing a travel warning
to all visiting Americans

16:19.662 --> 16:21.821
was not exactly what I had in mind.

16:21.822 --> 16:23.241
We have to get ahead of this guy.

16:23.242 --> 16:26.321
It's imperative that we warn the public,

16:26.322 --> 16:27.665
and I'd like to pay another visit

16:27.666 --> 16:29.621
to Father Consolmango...
He knows something.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.661
He wasn't forthcoming with us earlier.

16:31.662 --> 16:32.911
Father Consolmango has been

16:32.912 --> 16:35.451
a pillar of this community
for over 30 years.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.241
Señor Garrett, you must understand

16:37.242 --> 16:38.531
the politics involved.

16:38.532 --> 16:40.281
If I reach out to the archdiocese

16:40.282 --> 16:42.821
with such a request, they will deny it.

16:42.822 --> 16:44.991
They want nothing to do
with our investigation.

16:44.992 --> 16:47.081
We need to know what he knows.

16:47.082 --> 16:49.701
I have already been
reprimanded by my superiors

16:49.702 --> 16:52.241
for bringing you to question him.

16:52.242 --> 16:53.491
They gave me an ultimatum.

16:53.492 --> 16:55.081
I have to make progress,

16:55.082 --> 16:57.991
or I am off the case, and you with me.

16:57.992 --> 17:00.031
This is the last we speak of this.

17:00.032 --> 17:02.701
Detective. I'd like to give you

17:02.702 --> 17:04.491
our preliminary profile on the killer.

17:04.492 --> 17:06.762
My team has made progress.

17:09.372 --> 17:12.241
Okay.

17:12.242 --> 17:14.451
Let's break down what we've got so far.

17:14.452 --> 17:16.991
So, we know because of the
size and the age of the victims

17:16.992 --> 17:18.991
that we're looking for
a physically fit male

17:18.992 --> 17:20.741
local to the greater Pamplona area.

17:20.742 --> 17:23.871
And in flaunting the ears
inside the San Fermín Cathedral,

17:23.872 --> 17:26.491
it is a direct challenge to the Church.

17:26.492 --> 17:27.472
It's like he's...

17:27.473 --> 17:28.451
Anointing himself God.

17:28.452 --> 17:31.371
The ultimate arbiter of life
and death for his victims.

17:31.372 --> 17:33.491
A pretty extreme form of narcissism.

17:33.492 --> 17:34.951
Yeah, which means he'll be outspoken

17:34.952 --> 17:36.911
and very aggressive in his beliefs.

17:36.912 --> 17:40.411
Now, as far as why he has chosen
to express his rage in this way,

17:40.412 --> 17:42.531
by cutting off the ears,
it could be a scare tactic.

17:42.532 --> 17:44.201
Like the cartels in Mexico.

17:44.202 --> 17:45.871
The more extreme the mutilation,

17:45.872 --> 17:47.241
the more terrifying the message.

17:47.242 --> 17:49.371
In this case, "get off my lawn."

17:49.372 --> 17:50.955
We found that with offenders like this,

17:50.956 --> 17:53.701
their anger is rooted in
a past conflict or trauma.

17:53.702 --> 17:56.661
Although our research has
yet to turn anything up.

17:56.662 --> 18:00.371
You want to expand our parameters?

18:00.372 --> 18:02.531
I'll make a few calls,
see if we can get access

18:02.532 --> 18:04.411
to the records of the Regional Police,

18:04.412 --> 18:07.321
the Ertzaintza's, as well
as the National Police.

18:07.322 --> 18:08.387
Good.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.451
Jack.

18:09.452 --> 18:11.182
Monty's got something for us.

18:13.471 --> 18:15.031
You told me to look for patterns.

18:15.032 --> 18:17.152
Now, the thing about looking
for patterns is you start

18:17.153 --> 18:19.376
to see them everywhere, even
in places you don't expect.

18:19.377 --> 18:23.281
Able to track two of our three
Australian victims so far.

18:23.282 --> 18:25.121
Our first Australian victim

18:25.122 --> 18:26.911
took a selfie while on the course.

18:26.912 --> 18:29.531
Festival organizers banned
the use of cell phones.

18:29.532 --> 18:32.491
A few years ago, a man did
this and got himself gored.

18:32.492 --> 18:34.531
Our second Australian victim

18:34.532 --> 18:36.411
hit the bull with a
rolled-up newspaper.

18:36.412 --> 18:37.781
What's the big deal? He just reached out

18:37.782 --> 18:39.765
and tried to tap the bull.
Isn't that what you do?

18:39.766 --> 18:41.241
The rolled-up newspaper is supposed

18:41.242 --> 18:43.161
to be unfurled to distract the bull

18:43.162 --> 18:44.911
from striking you if you get too close.

18:44.912 --> 18:46.581
Swatting at the bull is dangerous.

18:46.582 --> 18:47.991
Distracting the animal by so much

18:47.992 --> 18:50.411
as touching it could
steer it off course.

18:50.412 --> 18:51.741
Separate it from the herd.

18:51.742 --> 18:53.581
And bulls separated from the herd

18:53.582 --> 18:55.121
are far more liable to attack.

18:55.122 --> 18:56.701
In running, you're joining the herd

18:56.702 --> 18:58.371
for its final moments of freedom.

18:58.372 --> 18:59.452
It's a sacred thing.

18:59.453 --> 19:00.531
So, each of our victims

19:00.532 --> 19:02.411
dishonored the sanctity of the run.

19:02.412 --> 19:04.621
Not just that, the bulls themselves.

19:04.622 --> 19:06.741
Clint's goal was to run on the horns,

19:06.742 --> 19:08.321
but what do you want to bet

19:08.322 --> 19:10.411
he also got a little
too close and personal?

19:10.412 --> 19:11.491
Well, let's see.

19:11.492 --> 19:13.411
He tried to touch the bull.

19:13.412 --> 19:16.451
This has nothing to do with religion.

19:16.452 --> 19:17.951
This is about our victim's actions

19:17.952 --> 19:19.581
toward the animals themselves.

19:19.582 --> 19:21.121
They disrespected the bull.

19:21.122 --> 19:22.745
Do you think our unsub
was on the course?

19:22.747 --> 19:25.372
Or he could have been in the Plaza.

19:25.372 --> 19:27.491
Photo booths post pictures
of the day's run almost

19:27.492 --> 19:30.382
frame by frame so people
can find themselves.

19:32.412 --> 19:34.411
According to these police reports,

19:34.412 --> 19:36.661
I got a guy who keeps
popping up in the same places

19:36.662 --> 19:39.621
as our Australian vics, Carlos Villa.

19:39.622 --> 19:43.161
Carlos Villa, animal rights activist.

19:43.162 --> 19:45.741
He was arrested three
years ago in Madrid

19:45.742 --> 19:49.491
for trespassing after he
tried to sabotage a bullfight.

19:49.492 --> 19:53.781
This guy has been arrested
13 times since 2007.

19:53.782 --> 19:57.371
All the charges were
regarding animal cruelty?

19:57.372 --> 20:00.581
Yes, there is currently
a warrant out on him

20:00.582 --> 20:02.581
for aggravated assault.

20:02.582 --> 20:04.886
Do we know if he's crossed
paths with each of our victims?

20:04.887 --> 20:07.201
That's a good bet,
indirectly if not directly.

20:07.202 --> 20:09.491
And he arrived in Pamplona the night

20:09.492 --> 20:11.491
before Clint went missing.

20:11.492 --> 20:12.875
He's got an axe to grind regarding

20:12.876 --> 20:14.321
the mistreatment of the bulls.

20:14.322 --> 20:15.951
Where is he now?

20:15.952 --> 20:19.991
According to his Twitter feed,
at a protest in the city square.

20:19.992 --> 20:21.802
Jack and Mae are closer.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.330
_

20:26.634 --> 20:27.634
_

20:30.726 --> 20:34.496
_

20:52.242 --> 20:53.327
Hey!

20:53.328 --> 20:54.512
Come on.

20:57.026 --> 21:00.985
Carlos, I am not hearing a lot
of empathy for the loss of life.

21:00.986 --> 21:02.565
Empathy?

21:02.566 --> 21:04.486
Most of the people that
come here don't even know

21:04.487 --> 21:06.446
that the same bulls
run through the street

21:06.447 --> 21:09.355
in the morning are
slaughtered that night!

21:09.356 --> 21:12.605
Over 7,000 bulls were killed in
bullfights in Spain last year.

21:12.606 --> 21:14.605
All right, so why'd you run?

21:14.606 --> 21:17.445
There's a warrant out on
me for a trumped-up charge.

21:17.446 --> 21:19.145
It was a cosmetics testing facility

21:19.146 --> 21:22.065
that routinely abused
the animals in its care.

21:22.066 --> 21:24.025
They didn't like when I took pictures.

21:24.026 --> 21:25.605
But I never cut anyone's ears off

21:25.606 --> 21:27.395
before if that's what you're asking.

21:27.396 --> 21:30.235
You ever seen this man?

21:30.236 --> 21:31.525
No.

21:31.527 --> 21:34.146
Mr. Villa, this is a
murder investigation.

21:34.147 --> 21:37.816
Three men are dead and two are missing.

21:37.817 --> 21:40.446
Did you know that, on
special occasions, matadors

21:40.447 --> 21:42.736
cut the ears and tails
off their vanquished bulls

21:42.737 --> 21:44.646
as trophies?

21:44.647 --> 21:46.526
You see, the matador
and his assistant work

21:46.527 --> 21:48.566
together to weaken the animal,

21:48.567 --> 21:51.646
and in a show of dominance,
slice its ears off.

21:51.647 --> 21:53.446
The bull dies.

21:53.447 --> 21:57.486
Coughing up its own blood,
too debilitated to even move.

21:57.487 --> 21:59.446
And in a final act of impudence,

21:59.447 --> 22:02.486
the matador hurls the
animal's ears into the crowd

22:02.487 --> 22:04.146
so they can be trampled on.

22:04.147 --> 22:06.247
And it's man that deserves my sympathy?

22:09.607 --> 22:11.026
Monty, tell us something good.

22:11.027 --> 22:13.446
Okay, I got the idea on
the second set of ears.

22:13.447 --> 22:14.896
They belong to Tony Downs,

22:14.897 --> 22:17.566
a 32-year-old animal rights
activist from Chicago.

22:17.567 --> 22:18.816
That doesn't make any sense.

22:18.817 --> 22:20.600
Why would one activist
kill another activist?

22:20.601 --> 22:22.526
He didn't.

22:22.527 --> 22:24.396
We just confirmed Carlos' alibi.

22:24.397 --> 22:25.736
He was at the hospital

22:25.737 --> 22:29.566
having his arm treated at
the time Clint disappeared.

22:29.567 --> 22:31.417
He's not our guy.

22:33.947 --> 22:37.316
Hey. Carlos' alibi checks out.

22:37.317 --> 22:39.106
These attacks aren't
about sending a message

22:39.107 --> 22:40.446
or making a statement.

22:40.447 --> 22:42.526
They're about establishing dominance.

22:42.527 --> 22:44.276
In keep the bodies and discarding

22:44.277 --> 22:47.526
the victim's ears, our killer
is emulating the matador.

22:47.527 --> 22:49.486
In Spain, bullfighting isn't a sport.

22:49.487 --> 22:51.396
Matadors, capes, costumes...

22:51.397 --> 22:53.646
It's as much symbolic
as it is theatrical.

22:53.647 --> 22:56.917
It is performance art that
ends in a ritual sacrifice.

22:59.147 --> 23:00.607
A tragedy told in three acts.

23:00.608 --> 23:02.066
Just like our unsub.

23:02.067 --> 23:05.686
Three victims, three
deaths, three disposal sites.

23:05.687 --> 23:07.686
This isn't someone who
sees man as inferior,

23:07.687 --> 23:10.646
but the bulls as superior.

23:10.647 --> 23:12.396
Detective, what's the significance

23:12.397 --> 23:13.566
of the three stages?

23:13.567 --> 23:15.106
In the first tercio,

23:15.107 --> 23:18.486
called the third of lances,
the matador observes the bull.

23:18.487 --> 23:20.837
He tests him, revealing his character.

23:23.817 --> 23:24.483
Aah!

23:24.618 --> 23:27.064
_

23:27.852 --> 23:31.213
_

23:33.567 --> 23:36.066
The second stage, called
the third of flags,

23:36.067 --> 23:37.546
is when the matador's assistants,

23:37.614 --> 23:40.993
his cuadrilla, put their stakes
in the animal to weaken him,

23:40.994 --> 23:43.094
but also to anger him.

23:51.534 --> 23:52.533
Aah!

23:52.534 --> 23:53.613
And the final stage...

23:53.614 --> 23:54.864
Third of death.

23:54.865 --> 23:56.113
Exactly.

23:56.114 --> 23:58.783
This is when the
matador uses his puntilla

23:58.784 --> 24:02.573
to slay the animal in a final
demonstration of supremacy.

24:02.574 --> 24:04.536
- Puntilla?
- It is a small, curved knife

24:04.537 --> 24:06.743
that severs the bull's spinal cord.

24:06.744 --> 24:08.327
That sounds like the weapon our unsub's

24:08.328 --> 24:09.533
using to remove the ears.

24:09.534 --> 24:11.573
So like our unsub, the matador

24:11.574 --> 24:13.953
stalks them, tortures
them, and kills them.

24:13.954 --> 24:16.453
You think we're looking
for a torero? A matador?

24:16.454 --> 24:18.913
Or someone who thinks
of themselves as one.

24:18.914 --> 24:21.493
Like a torero, someone
who respects the animal

24:21.494 --> 24:23.493
as an equal, or the opponent.

24:23.494 --> 24:26.453
Let's cross-reference
former and current matadors

24:26.454 --> 24:29.993
with criminal records
that fit the profile.

24:56.728 --> 24:59.687
The festival employees are
almost completely accounted for,

24:59.688 --> 25:01.607
and we have confirmed the alibis

25:01.608 --> 25:04.607
for all the matadors
currently in Pamplona.

25:04.608 --> 25:06.368
Jack?

25:08.688 --> 25:11.647
Our unsub has a very
narrow comfort zone,

25:11.648 --> 25:13.477
yet the crowds all but guarantee

25:13.478 --> 25:15.227
he is not holding his victims here.

25:15.228 --> 25:16.811
Yeah, but he needs time to torture them,

25:16.812 --> 25:18.607
so he's holding them somewhere.

25:18.608 --> 25:19.918
Yeah, we know he's mobile.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.227
And he's sophisticated,

25:21.228 --> 25:24.727
so he'd know better than to
hold two adult males at one time.

25:24.728 --> 25:27.038
So, what is he doing with the bodies?

25:27.959 --> 25:28.959
_

25:30.909 --> 25:33.510
_

25:35.470 --> 25:37.416
_

25:37.722 --> 25:39.973
_

25:41.228 --> 25:42.955
_

25:50.648 --> 25:53.107
Let's say he's keeping the vics.

25:53.108 --> 25:55.687
He'd need a place that's
secure and private.

25:55.688 --> 25:57.267
Probably outside of the city.

25:57.268 --> 25:59.687
Like a ranch? A warehouse?

25:59.688 --> 26:01.017
There's less than a dozen ranches

26:01.018 --> 26:03.057
that provide bulls to
the festival, right?

26:03.058 --> 26:04.347
Historically, yes.

26:04.348 --> 26:06.517
But today, there must
be more than 30 breeders

26:06.518 --> 26:07.847
spread across the country.

26:07.848 --> 26:10.727
There's no one that has more respect

26:10.728 --> 26:12.107
or a more vested interest

26:12.108 --> 26:14.397
in the well-being of the
bulls than the breeders.

26:14.398 --> 26:16.807
Or the people they employ.

26:16.808 --> 26:17.998
Perdón, señor.

26:17.999 --> 26:19.288
Sí.

26:19.626 --> 26:22.027
_

26:22.108 --> 26:23.658
Robert Tanida.

26:23.941 --> 26:25.674
_

26:26.558 --> 26:29.347
A third American citizen,

26:29.348 --> 26:32.687
Robert Tanida, has
been reported missing.

26:32.688 --> 26:34.727
Third victim, just like the Australians.

26:34.728 --> 26:37.227
Detective Esposito,
can you assist my Agents

26:37.228 --> 26:39.057
in finding out what the family knows,

26:39.058 --> 26:40.557
and quickly?

26:40.558 --> 26:41.807
Yes.

26:41.808 --> 26:43.977
If our unsub has his
third and final victim,

26:43.978 --> 26:46.078
this is our last chance to catch him.

26:52.728 --> 26:54.151
I'm gonna follow up with something.

26:54.152 --> 26:55.977
I'll be back soon.

27:15.808 --> 27:17.477
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

27:17.478 --> 27:20.057
It's been two weeks
since my last confession.

27:20.058 --> 27:22.847
And are you here now to confess?

27:22.848 --> 27:24.647
No.

27:24.648 --> 27:27.897
I believe you have information
that can help my investigation.

27:27.898 --> 27:32.477
I had a feeling you would return.

27:32.478 --> 27:35.847
You are a dutiful agent, Mr. Garrett.

27:35.848 --> 27:38.307
And a man of faith.

27:38.308 --> 27:41.897
A catholic.

27:41.898 --> 27:44.647
You would have me disobey canon law

27:44.648 --> 27:46.187
and divulge information

27:46.188 --> 27:50.057
I learned in this sacred
space that we are now in?

27:50.058 --> 27:53.807
I understand the position
I'm putting you in.

27:53.808 --> 27:56.477
You want me to defy my covenant

27:56.478 --> 27:59.107
with God, one that you believe in!

27:59.108 --> 28:02.368
Do you know who's
responsible for these crimes?

28:04.688 --> 28:07.147
Mr. Garrett, please.

28:07.148 --> 28:11.517
Innocent men are dying.
Their killer might go free.

28:11.518 --> 28:16.057
What you are asking
of me is not possible!

28:16.058 --> 28:19.517
This killer deserves to answer
for his crimes here and now.

28:19.518 --> 28:22.147
Surely there is a moral imperative

28:22.148 --> 28:24.807
that you can't ignore.

28:24.808 --> 28:27.847
Father, I mean no offense.

28:27.848 --> 28:30.937
I can imagine the burden
that you must feel.

28:30.938 --> 28:34.607
See, I've lived with
my life as you have,

28:34.608 --> 28:36.847
serving a cause greater than myself,

28:36.848 --> 28:39.038
and I, too, took an oath.

28:41.768 --> 28:45.437
Clint Smith.

28:45.438 --> 28:48.847
Tony Downs.

28:48.848 --> 28:50.658
Robert Tanida.

28:52.808 --> 28:55.538
There's still time to save their lives.

29:04.938 --> 29:07.557
We'll find another way.

29:07.558 --> 29:10.017
Thank you for your time.

29:10.018 --> 29:14.897
God opposes the proud.

29:14.898 --> 29:18.828
But shows favor to the humble.

29:20.308 --> 29:22.847
Do you know this proverb?

29:22.848 --> 29:25.847
Peter is trying to remind us

29:25.848 --> 29:29.368
that it is not our
place to know all things.

29:31.808 --> 29:35.118
It is a passage I return to often.

29:37.058 --> 29:40.078
If only to humble
myself before our Father.

29:45.018 --> 29:49.658
I pray that you catch this man.

29:51.608 --> 29:53.208
And put him away.

29:55.518 --> 29:59.948
Peace be with you, Mr. Garrett.

30:03.898 --> 30:05.977
And also with you, Father.

30:12.996 --> 30:15.235
_

30:18.086 --> 30:20.738
_

30:25.137 --> 30:27.085
_

30:44.648 --> 30:47.187
Let me guess. He wasn't forthcoming.

30:47.188 --> 30:50.767
He's... he's a good man
in an impossible situation.

30:50.768 --> 30:52.187
What did he say?

30:52.188 --> 30:55.647
God opposes the proud, but
shows favor to the humble.

30:55.648 --> 30:56.543
Proverbs.

30:56.544 --> 30:57.437
It's also mentioned

30:57.438 --> 31:00.057
in the book of Peter to the Shepherds

31:00.058 --> 31:02.057
to be faithful servants to their flock,

31:02.058 --> 31:04.767
to watch over those
entrusted to their care.

31:04.768 --> 31:08.227
Is the verse significant?

31:08.228 --> 31:11.107
Maybe not in content, but context.

31:11.108 --> 31:12.977
Monty. I want you to do a search.

31:12.978 --> 31:14.267
Sure thing, what's going on?

31:14.268 --> 31:16.347
Father Consolmango said what he could,

31:16.348 --> 31:19.307
and what he gave me was 1 Peter 5:5.

31:19.308 --> 31:20.663
Could be an address.

31:20.664 --> 31:22.017
Part of a phone number.

31:22.018 --> 31:23.307
Date of birth.

31:23.308 --> 31:26.017
Okay, there are 360,000
people born every day.

31:26.018 --> 31:30.347
In Pamplona, I have thousands
of boys born on may 5th,

31:30.348 --> 31:32.937
including lots and lots of Pedros.

31:32.938 --> 31:34.807
What about Simon?

31:34.808 --> 31:37.477
Peter was born Simon, son of John.

31:37.478 --> 31:41.017
Before Christ anointed him
as one of his disciples.

31:41.018 --> 31:44.937
Ka-ching, Simon Alonso,
born may 5, 1983,

31:44.938 --> 31:46.557
christened by Father Consolmango,

31:46.558 --> 31:49.847
the only son of Xavi and Delores Alonso.

31:49.848 --> 31:51.607
He ended up working at Foto Navarre,

31:51.608 --> 31:54.607
a photo booth in the old
city a couple years back.

31:54.608 --> 31:56.648
That's where they post the
photos of the day's runs.

31:56.649 --> 31:58.792
He could have seen each one
of our victims from there.

31:58.793 --> 32:01.687
Address is on its way to you now.

32:01.688 --> 32:05.107
Help me!

32:05.108 --> 32:08.187
Aaah!

32:08.188 --> 32:10.477
Three years ago, a global
advocacy group headed

32:10.478 --> 32:13.147
by American and Australian
animal rights activists

32:13.148 --> 32:16.187
snuck onto the Alonso's ranch
and freed their prized bulls.

32:16.188 --> 32:18.727
Now, in the resulting chaos,
two people were gored to death,

32:18.728 --> 32:20.227
including one of the activists.

32:20.228 --> 32:22.847
Because of this, the family's
bulls were slaughtered.

32:22.848 --> 32:25.107
Why are we just finding
out about this now?

32:25.108 --> 32:27.107
The Alonso breed is a very respected,

32:27.108 --> 32:28.267
ancient bloodline.

32:28.268 --> 32:30.107
Now, they're a prominent family,

32:30.108 --> 32:31.937
so they successfully lobbied
to keep the incident quiet.

32:31.938 --> 32:33.521
Not to mention, the story was eclipsed

32:33.522 --> 32:34.727
by a factory fire

32:34.728 --> 32:36.187
that killed 100 people the next day.

32:36.188 --> 32:37.628
The destruction of the family's herd

32:37.629 --> 32:39.612
could have been the cause
of our unsub's stressor.

32:39.613 --> 32:41.227
Yeah, the loss of a family business.

32:41.228 --> 32:43.977
Their social standing could have
sent our unsub into a tailspin.

32:47.288 --> 32:50.651
_

32:57.188 --> 32:58.607
Excuse me, have you seen this man?

32:58.608 --> 32:59.607
No.

32:59.608 --> 33:00.358
No.

33:00.359 --> 33:01.107
No, no.

33:01.108 --> 33:02.868
Excuse me.

33:03.481 --> 33:04.481
_

33:10.018 --> 33:11.708
Thank you.

33:22.148 --> 33:25.187
Jack!

33:25.188 --> 33:27.057
Hey!

33:40.108 --> 33:42.248
Where is he holding his victims?

33:42.682 --> 33:44.769
_

33:47.473 --> 33:48.473
_

33:48.959 --> 33:51.959
_

33:54.268 --> 33:57.847
He says they're dead.

33:57.848 --> 34:00.017
All the victims are dead.

34:00.018 --> 34:01.767
Every man fan out, cordon off this area.

34:01.768 --> 34:03.448
Treat this as an active crime scene.

34:03.824 --> 34:05.738
_

34:07.559 --> 34:08.559
_

34:10.398 --> 34:13.897
He said he couldn't protect his family.

34:13.898 --> 34:15.147
I don't know.

34:15.148 --> 34:17.766
Ramblings of a madman.

34:17.768 --> 34:19.687
Who we'll now put behind bars

34:19.688 --> 34:21.306
thanks to you and your team.

34:21.308 --> 34:23.726
My men will find out what
he's done with the bodies.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.266
Gracias, Agent Garrett.

34:25.268 --> 34:27.328
Great work.

34:38.898 --> 34:41.187
Jack? What is it?

34:41.188 --> 34:43.107
All the physical evidence
says we got our guy,

34:43.108 --> 34:44.766
but something's bothering me.

34:44.768 --> 34:47.847
We profiled this unsub as a matador...

34:47.848 --> 34:50.516
Dominant, statement-driven.

34:50.518 --> 34:53.016
The guy we just arrested isn't either.

34:53.018 --> 34:54.516
He did lack the confidence

34:54.518 --> 34:56.347
you'd expect from such an offender.

34:56.348 --> 34:58.767
But he expressed guilt.
He confessed to the priest.

34:58.768 --> 35:00.937
Yeah, but we did say he'd need a place

35:00.938 --> 35:02.517
that was secluded to hold his victims

35:02.518 --> 35:04.897
while he tortured them, which
that place definitely wasn't.

35:04.898 --> 35:06.241
What if we're looking for a team,

35:06.242 --> 35:08.107
with dominant to our submissive?

35:08.108 --> 35:10.517
Esposito, he said that
matadors have assistants,

35:10.518 --> 35:13.437
people who work to weaken the
bull before the final kill.

35:13.438 --> 35:15.647
Yeah, but we were
correct about the profile.

35:15.648 --> 35:17.751
We were right about the
stressor, it led us to Simon.

35:17.752 --> 35:20.437
Which means we're looking for
someone with a shared trauma.

35:20.438 --> 35:22.937
Someone with significant
influence over Simon.

35:22.938 --> 35:26.448
They say that bullfighting
is a family business.

35:28.749 --> 35:29.847
Hey, Monty,

35:29.848 --> 35:31.711
what happened to the
rest of the Alonso family?

35:31.712 --> 35:34.517
The Alonsos are no longer in
Pamplona, a far as I can tell.

35:34.518 --> 35:36.397
Delores Alonso passed away a year ago,

35:36.398 --> 35:39.347
but Simon's father is
completely off the grid,

35:39.348 --> 35:41.131
although someone is
still paying the mortgage

35:41.132 --> 35:42.847
on an abandoned
property the family owns,

35:42.848 --> 35:44.607
the Alonso bullfighting ring.

35:44.608 --> 35:46.847
That's it, the Father.

35:46.848 --> 35:48.517
Monty, get us everything you can

35:48.518 --> 35:50.788
on the patriarch of the Alonso family.

35:59.018 --> 36:00.807
Please...

36:10.907 --> 36:12.786
Simon and his father were outcasts.

36:12.787 --> 36:15.866
I wouldn't be surprised if they
developed a siege mentality.

36:15.867 --> 36:18.467
Keep your eyes open.

36:22.827 --> 36:25.337
Please, let me go.

36:31.157 --> 36:33.797
Wait, wait, wait.

36:38.657 --> 36:40.536
Stand back.

37:07.430 --> 37:09.339
_

37:11.447 --> 37:12.946
Ah!

37:35.091 --> 37:36.901
Simmons.

37:42.051 --> 37:44.260
He's... he's feeding
his victims to the bulls.

37:44.261 --> 37:46.050
Ugh.

38:04.131 --> 38:06.010
Got you now, huh?

38:06.011 --> 38:07.991
Ha, ha!

38:12.891 --> 38:14.590
Drop your weapon!

38:14.591 --> 38:16.031
Aah!

38:16.117 --> 38:17.117
_

38:17.391 --> 38:20.630
Bulls were kings!

38:20.631 --> 38:22.760
They lived! They were gods!

38:22.761 --> 38:25.180
You don't have to do
this. This man is innocent.

38:25.181 --> 38:27.510
Foreign bastards.

38:27.511 --> 38:31.090
My bulls defined San Fermín!

38:31.091 --> 38:35.630
My family no deserve this.

38:35.631 --> 38:36.800
No!

38:42.131 --> 38:44.010
We need to get an
ambulance here immediately.

38:46.801 --> 38:48.050
It's okay.

39:24.841 --> 39:28.180
Father.

39:28.181 --> 39:30.151
You caught the man responsible?

39:34.011 --> 39:35.390
Father, in my line of work,

39:35.391 --> 39:38.430
I see the worst humanity has to offer.

39:38.431 --> 39:41.260
Chaos and death,

39:41.261 --> 39:45.340
it can be hard to remember the good.

39:45.341 --> 39:49.090
Sometimes it's tough
to have faith in people,

39:49.091 --> 39:51.680
in institutions.

39:51.681 --> 39:53.220
In God.

39:53.221 --> 39:57.890
You feel called to intervene
in the face of injustice.

39:57.891 --> 40:02.680
That in and of itself
is an act of faith.

40:02.681 --> 40:06.430
A good shepherd always
looks out for his flock.

40:06.431 --> 40:08.890
The book of Amos tells us,

40:08.891 --> 40:12.220
"let justice roll on like a river."

40:12.221 --> 40:16.130
"And righteousness like
a never-falling stream."

40:16.131 --> 40:18.151
Amen.

40:22.841 --> 40:25.071
Thank you, Father.
