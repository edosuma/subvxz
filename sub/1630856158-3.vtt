00:42.709 --> 00:46.463
Ingrid, how simply delightful to see you.
I would offer you tea or coffee,

00:46.463 --> 00:50.300
but I think what you really need is
a big slice of humble pie. What's this?

00:50.801 --> 00:53.804
My resignation. Let's get this over with.

00:53.804 --> 00:55.472
No need to go that far,

00:55.472 --> 00:58.058
unless there's some personal scandal
I don't know about.

00:58.851 --> 01:01.436
You set a tiger team on MI5.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.647
What's that?
I'm not familiar with the jargon.

01:06.149 --> 01:11.488
A tiger team is a unit employed
to test an organization's defenses.

01:11.488 --> 01:14.199
So, sort of set a thief to catch a thief.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.910
Pay someone to check whether
your security systems are any good.

01:16.910 --> 01:17.995
That's it.

01:18.871 --> 01:21.874
In that case, yes, I did do that.
Guilty as charged.

01:22.499 --> 01:25.085
But isn't it more to probe weaknesses,

01:25.669 --> 01:29.173
test whether said organization
can pass muster under pressure?

01:32.092 --> 01:34.219
Yes. All of that.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.138
And how did MI5 fare?

01:37.806 --> 01:40.309
One of our agents was blackmailed
into breaking into the Park

01:40.309 --> 01:43.562
to steal the PM's vetting file.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.898
So far, so bad. Did they get it?

01:45.898 --> 01:47.608
- No.
- Shame. I'd love a gander.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.776
Is it true he gets
his wife to piss on him,

01:49.776 --> 01:51.612
or is that just a rumor I started?
I forget.

01:53.697 --> 01:58.202
They got close enough that this counts as
a major security breach on my watch,

01:58.202 --> 01:59.536
which is why I have to go.

02:07.002 --> 02:09.003
I don't want you to go, Ingrid.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.674
Then what do you want?

02:17.930 --> 02:18.931
Finally.

02:24.353 --> 02:27.856
You made me look like a muppet
by bringing me a fake diamond

02:27.856 --> 02:29.775
just so you could sneak into the Park.

02:29.775 --> 02:33.529
Look, this has just been
one big misunderstanding. Okay?

02:33.529 --> 02:36.198
Please. For the 1,000th time,

02:36.907 --> 02:39.326
I believed that Catherine Standish's life
was in danger.

02:39.326 --> 02:43.372
Relax. Chieftain are handing her over now.
Standish is fine.

02:43.372 --> 02:44.873
I know she's fine.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.461
F-- God's--

02:52.297 --> 02:53.924
Come on! Fuck.

03:06.770 --> 03:10.524
Well played, mate. Well played.
Mission accomplished.

03:10.524 --> 03:14.319
Tiger team are a roaring success.
And the beers? On me.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.154
I don't drink.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.991
Okay, well, have a shandy then.
But a celebration is in order.

03:18.991 --> 03:21.994
Chieftain beat the spooks.
They're supposed to be the professionals,

03:21.994 --> 03:24.288
and we turned one of them into our puppet.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.206
This is great for business.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.084
Gonna get a lot of contracts out of this.
A lot.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.044
And you, my friend, can have first dibs.

03:32.004 --> 03:34.006
I think I might have a rest after this.

03:34.590 --> 03:38.302
Okay. Well, let me know. Well done, son.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.056
Who is this? Am I going with him?

03:45.517 --> 03:47.644
Maybe you don't know.
You're obviously not in charge.

03:49.021 --> 03:51.440
Miss Standish, I'm here to take you
wherever you want to go.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.193
She's not getting out, you're getting in.

03:54.193 --> 03:56.069
What the fuck are you doing?

03:56.612 --> 03:58.322
The operation is over.
This isn't part of--

03:58.322 --> 04:00.782
Hands on your head.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.076
Don't.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.788
Hands on head.

04:08.207 --> 04:10.000
Have you lost your fucking mind?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.502
Take his gun. Tie him up.

04:12.044 --> 04:13.629
You move over, please.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.634
- Stop!
- No!

04:35.317 --> 04:37.486
Come on! Fucking come on!

04:41.031 --> 04:42.699
The fuck are you playing at?

04:49.748 --> 04:50.832
Perfect. Brilliant.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.168
- Head down.
- All right. Fucking hell.

04:56.255 --> 04:57.339
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.133
So am I now an actual hostage?

05:58.942 --> 06:02.237
MI5 has become rather stuck in its ways.

06:02.905 --> 06:06.658
So I'll be bringing in advisers from
the private sector who can help

06:06.658 --> 06:11.914
with streamlining and efficiency
so that the taxpayer gets value for money.

06:12.581 --> 06:18.045
I see. And am I to assume
these people will be from Chieftain?

06:18.629 --> 06:20.881
Having just got the better of
your security systems,

06:20.881 --> 06:24.218
I feel that they're more than qualified to
tell you where you might be going wrong.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.553
The CEO is an old friend of yours.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.640
I happened to be at school
with Sly Monteith,

06:29.640 --> 06:31.266
but I was at school with a lot of people.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.977
Do you have
any financial links to the firm?

06:34.811 --> 06:38.565
That's a very impertinent question,
Ingrid, and one I'm unable to answer.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.985
As you know, all my financial assets
have been placed in a blind trust.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.489
If you have any more questions,

06:45.489 --> 06:48.784
I wonder if I should fish
that letter out of the bin

06:48.784 --> 06:50.577
and give Diana Taverner a call.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.580
No, that won't be necessary.

06:53.580 --> 06:57.459
Good. I look forward to
a new phase in our relationship...

06:58.794 --> 07:00.295
in which I am the daddy.

07:05.968 --> 07:09.304
Jesus. Elton John live bootlegs.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.891
I'll have to borrow this.
Cure for my insomnia.

07:13.475 --> 07:14.560
God, you're ignorant.

07:15.185 --> 07:18.272
The greatest songwriter of
the last 50 years, Elton John.

07:23.318 --> 07:26.780
- God, this is boring.
- Geez, it's like being out with my kids.

07:27.739 --> 07:30.450
What, you check gambling websites
when you're out with your kids?

07:30.951 --> 07:33.078
Looking after their financial security.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.122
By remortgaging?

07:38.333 --> 07:39.168
Ho told me.

07:39.168 --> 07:41.420
I'm remortgaging
'cause we're getting the loft done.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.255
Nothing to do with my gambling.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.382
Not that it's any of
your fucking business, by the way.

07:45.382 --> 07:46.842
You're the one that wanted to partner up.

07:46.842 --> 07:48.302
You're hardly selling yourself
as a prospect.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.721
- At least I don't get high on the job.
- I never get high on the job.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.309
God, you're always here
to bring me right fucking down.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.519
- Hey, where you going? Why?
- In there.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.855
To see what we can learn
about the man that's got Standish.

08:00.564 --> 08:01.690
We don't have a warrant.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.775
We didn't have one for Catherine's flat.

08:03.775 --> 08:06.695
That's different. We knew her, and
technically, we shouldn't have done it.

08:07.362 --> 08:08.739
Stay in the car then.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.324
Shut up.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.502
- Come on.
- Fuck's sake.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.920
God, you're so good at this.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.254
Can you just wait a second?

08:27.466 --> 08:28.592
Just leave it.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.138
Seriously?

08:33.679 --> 08:35.265
See? Easy.

08:43.273 --> 08:48.153
<i>Just in case you're stupid enough
to still be sitting on Donovan's flat,</i>

08:48.987 --> 08:51.573
you can get back to the office.
It was a tiger team.

08:52.115 --> 08:55.619
They took Standish to pressure
Cartwright to break into the Park.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.663
Shit. Did he do it?

08:59.498 --> 09:00.499
Yep.

09:03.043 --> 09:06.213
Lamb. Catherine was taken by a tiger team.

09:06.922 --> 09:09.633
What, so we staked this place out
and broke in for no reason?

09:10.384 --> 09:11.969
Well, at least it got us
out of the office.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.221
- We better get back there.
- I'm gonna take a piss before we leave.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.139
Make it quick.

09:17.266 --> 09:18.934
I'll take as long as I like, thanks.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.851
If you like listening to women pee,
I think there's websites for that.

10:00.851 --> 10:02.394
You need to come and see this.

10:23.123 --> 10:26.627
So what? It's just the planning
for the tiger team op.

10:29.171 --> 10:30.422
Knew they were watching us.

10:32.174 --> 10:33.342
There's another wall.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.019
"Grey Books"?

10:44.520 --> 10:47.523
Yeah.
MI5 compendium of conspiracy theories.

10:47.523 --> 10:49.358
Yeah, I know what
the Grey Books are. Thanks.

10:50.943 --> 10:53.195
But what's this bullshit got to do
with Catherine?

11:43.203 --> 11:45.122
- <i>Where are those from?</i>
- Donovan's flat.

11:45.122 --> 11:49.042
What are you doing in there?
I told you it was a tiger team.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.669
Yeah. Well,
we were kind of already in here.

11:50.669 --> 11:54.131
<i>So Sean Donovan's a conspiracy nut
with a phase two?</i>

11:54.840 --> 11:59.553
Yeah. Phase two is the Grey Books,
MI5 compendium of conspiracy--

11:59.553 --> 12:01.430
Yeah. I know what the Grey Books are.

12:02.472 --> 12:05.142
Right. Well, it looks like
he's gonna keep hold of Standish

12:05.142 --> 12:06.476
<i>till he gets a look at them.</i>

12:07.060 --> 12:09.730
Well, document everything
and get it to Ho. Right?

12:09.730 --> 12:13.025
And do not let anyone outside
of Slough House know about this

12:13.025 --> 12:15.944
until I've worked out how much of
a nut bag Donovan is.

12:41.512 --> 12:44.264
- You're fucking mad, you are.
- Yep.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.227
Through there.

12:54.858 --> 12:55.859
Stairs.

12:58.237 --> 13:00.739
There's a similarity
between you and that other man.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.282
- Is that a coincidence?
- Shut up.

13:02.824 --> 13:05.786
Clearly a sore point, which makes me
think it's not a coincidence.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.412
I said, "Shut up."

13:11.416 --> 13:13.418
You didn't have to look
for the light switch,

13:13.418 --> 13:16.380
so this is your house, isn't it?
Your family home.

13:16.380 --> 13:21.301
And that other man must be Ben,
so you're either Sarah or Alison.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.062
Stinking pile of dog shit.

13:34.106 --> 13:35.107
Smile.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.362
Let's see what Chieftain make of this.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.574
They'll rain blood and fire on you.

13:43.574 --> 13:46.326
Oh, yeah. Can't wait. Get in.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.583
Sit tight. Wait it out, and it'll be fine.

13:55.294 --> 13:57.004
How long before Chieftain call?

13:57.004 --> 13:58.088
No idea.

14:09.975 --> 14:11.977
Now we've got one of yours
and one of MI5's.

14:12.686 --> 14:16.273
If you want them both released unharmed,
you need to do exactly what we say.

14:16.273 --> 14:17.482
Are you listening?

14:18.859 --> 14:19.860
Lamb.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.236
<i>Well, you got nerve.</i>

14:21.236 --> 14:25.657
<i>First you turn Slough House into
a sorting office, then you stand me up.</i>

14:25.657 --> 14:29.494
Well, they're doing a total
security reset. It's mayhem down there.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.832
Yeah, I can see that. What's the fallout?

14:33.832 --> 14:38.545
<i>Remains to be seen.
Tearney's with Judd as we speak.</i>

14:38.545 --> 14:41.089
Well, what are you doing?
Measuring curtains for her office?

14:41.089 --> 14:46.303
I have learned never to underestimate
Dame Ingrid. She is a survivor.

14:47.012 --> 14:49.973
Yeah, she is,
and Judd may have crowed too soon.

14:49.973 --> 14:53.894
Tiger team's gone rogue.
They won't let Standish go.

14:54.728 --> 14:58.232
Why on earth not?
Surely the operation is completed.

14:59.149 --> 15:03.362
Well, I thought they might have already
been in touch. They want the Grey Books.

15:03.362 --> 15:04.530
They told you that?

15:05.155 --> 15:10.160
<i>No, kidnapper's wall planner.
Name of Sean Donovan.</i>

15:11.995 --> 15:13.413
Well, I haven't heard anything.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.708
And if they were demanding the Grey Books,

15:16.708 --> 15:21.547
I'd know 'cause they've been relocated
to the facility under my supervision.

15:22.506 --> 15:25.467
Yeah, which means
they're one up from toilet paper.

15:25.467 --> 15:28.554
<i>In return for the heads-up,
I would like Cartwright back.</i>

15:31.682 --> 15:33.183
As I'm sure you're aware,

15:33.183 --> 15:35.686
I do not have command of
the Dogs right now.

15:36.645 --> 15:39.439
Send him out, Diana, or I'm coming in.

15:47.406 --> 15:48.407
Get up.

15:50.242 --> 15:51.285
Get up!

15:51.285 --> 15:54.454
You know, I'm kinda fine down here,
you know?

15:56.665 --> 15:58.667
I'm not gonna ask you again.
River, get up.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.586
Whatever issues you have--

16:00.586 --> 16:03.463
That you clearly have,
that you're working through--

16:04.089 --> 16:05.716
Maybe you should just talk to someone.

16:06.425 --> 16:09.970
Because based on this, I just-- I don't
think violence is making you happy.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.936
Don't know why you're crying, son.
You got nothing between your legs.

16:24.943 --> 16:27.362
Yeah, you need to get this
out of your system quickly

16:27.988 --> 16:29.823
before Lamb comes to get me.

16:30.324 --> 16:32.242
You think I give a fuck about Lamb?

16:32.242 --> 16:33.327
I kinda do, actually. Yeah.

16:33.327 --> 16:38.207
What is he, some sort of twisted fucking
father figure to you?

16:38.207 --> 16:39.958
Because you never knew your own dad,

16:39.958 --> 16:42.878
and you'll never fucking be as good
as your grandfather, eh?

16:44.546 --> 16:46.548
You wanna hit me, don't you?

16:47.299 --> 16:48.800
You want to have a fucking swing at me?

16:48.800 --> 16:51.553
Come on, champ!
Fucking have at it! Come on.

16:56.558 --> 16:57.559
Sorry.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.690
Attack a senior agent now?

17:04.942 --> 17:07.361
A head Dog. Nah.

17:08.654 --> 17:10.696
No, that would definitely
get me kicked out.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.327
So you have at it, champ.

17:17.204 --> 17:21.208
Because any minute now,
that door is gonna open

17:22.416 --> 17:24.252
and I'm just gonna walk right out of here.

17:27.506 --> 17:31.343
And until then,
I can take whatever it is you've got.

17:38.851 --> 17:39.977
Are you feeling what--

17:55.367 --> 17:56.243
Come in!

17:57.244 --> 18:01.415
Right. Right on cue.
My ticket out of here.

18:07.754 --> 18:08.672
Got his bollocks yet?

18:08.672 --> 18:10.883
Yeah, I've softened him up for ya.

18:13.135 --> 18:15.053
No, wait, listen-- Whoa.

18:17.306 --> 18:19.558
Look, I know we've had our differences,

18:20.225 --> 18:23.896
but I've just gotta warn you,
I do have very tough balls.

18:24.396 --> 18:26.690
And I'm only saying that because you're--

18:31.028 --> 18:33.238
Okay, let's get this to Ho,
see what he can turn up.

18:33.238 --> 18:35.449
He's just gonna read this
and agree with most of it.

18:35.991 --> 18:37.492
Probably wrote some of it.

18:39.912 --> 18:42.122
- Police!
- We're in here.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.373
- Did Lamb send you?
- Whoa.

18:43.373 --> 18:44.291
Don't know a Lamb.

18:45.918 --> 18:48.212
Neighbor called.
Said he saw you creeping in.

18:48.212 --> 18:49.755
- Wait. This is a crime scene.
- Idiots.

18:49.755 --> 18:52.257
- Yeah. You done a burglary.
- We're MI5.

18:52.257 --> 18:53.342
Yeah. Check my pockets.

18:53.342 --> 18:55.511
So I can get spiked by a junkie needle?
No, thanks.

18:55.511 --> 18:58.722
Do I look like a junkie?
Look, I've got an MI5 ID in my pocket.

18:58.722 --> 19:00.682
Check it now
before it gets really bad for you.

19:02.518 --> 19:03.936
Check his. I'll check hers.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.730
- Yeah, or you could make some calls.
- In the back pocket. Right there.

19:11.693 --> 19:13.612
Okay, boss. Looks legit.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.282
What's this then?

19:17.783 --> 19:19.159
Got to be fucking kidding me.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.869
- I'm undercover. I've got it for a sting.
- Uh-huh.

19:39.012 --> 19:40.347
<i>Jackson Lamb?</i>

19:41.181 --> 19:44.351
- Maybe.
- <i>This is Officer Moseley of the Met.</i>

19:44.351 --> 19:48.272
I'm calling 'cause I've arrested
Marcus Longridge and Shirley Dander

19:48.814 --> 19:52.568
for breaking and entering,
and possession of class-A drugs.

19:54.278 --> 19:55.112
Uh-huh.

19:55.112 --> 19:58.365
Longridge says he had the go-ahead
from you to enter the flat,

19:58.365 --> 20:01.451
and Dander says
the drugs were for a sting.

20:02.828 --> 20:07.207
All right, you can let 'em go
and then give 'em a message.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.584
Yeah, go ahead.

20:11.211 --> 20:13.213
Yeah. Uh-huh.

20:21.346 --> 20:23.265
Sorry about that. You're free to go.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.350
No hard feelings. Just doing your job.

20:37.196 --> 20:39.740
- Flush it.
- You don't need it for your sting?

20:41.450 --> 20:42.367
Flush it.

20:47.915 --> 20:50.125
Before you go, Lamb had a message for you.

20:51.460 --> 20:52.961
"You're fucking fired.

20:52.961 --> 20:55.589
I got fucking hemorrhoids
that are more fucking use than you."

21:36.463 --> 21:37.881
Got some rubbish for you.

21:38.841 --> 21:39.883
What kept you?

21:39.883 --> 21:43.387
Thanks for giving him a good kicking.
Saves me the bother.

21:44.179 --> 21:48.350
You're gonna bring me that diamond
and the name of the idiot fucking horse

21:48.350 --> 21:50.352
that took it,
or I'm gonna come over there,

21:50.352 --> 21:53.647
and I'm gonna open you up
like a tin of beans. Do you hear me?

21:56.191 --> 21:59.027
I'm trying to place you. You--

22:00.445 --> 22:04.199
You're the bloke that walks
around our local park picking up dog shit.

22:05.909 --> 22:07.119
We danced once.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.663
Next time I'll put you down.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.164
Dream on, sir.

22:12.082 --> 22:13.876
I could take you down with an eyelash.

22:19.256 --> 22:21.008
Right. Before you say anything,

22:21.008 --> 22:23.427
what would you have done
if you'd been sent that?

22:24.136 --> 22:26.388
Well, I'd done what they said.
Then once they let her go,

22:26.388 --> 22:28.307
I'd have killed every one of the bastards.

22:28.932 --> 22:31.393
- Yes, mate?
- Chelsea, please, mate.

22:31.393 --> 22:33.520
If they threatened to kill you,
on the other hand,

22:33.520 --> 22:35.564
I'd buy 'em a beer and the bullets.

22:38.150 --> 22:39.318
Hang on a minute, mate.

22:40.485 --> 22:43.155
Wait, what are you doing?
Come on, out you get.

22:43.822 --> 22:45.532
Why? Where are you going?

22:46.491 --> 22:48.535
Chelsea. Did you not hear me?

22:50.120 --> 22:51.538
Where am I going?

22:52.122 --> 22:53.916
Go meet Louisa at Chieftain.

22:54.416 --> 22:57.211
They're the twats behind all of this.
She'll fill you in.

22:57.211 --> 23:02.382
But the headline is they hired a team with
a hidden agenda, still holding Standish.

23:10.682 --> 23:12.476
Is it not on the way?
Can I not just come with you?

23:13.393 --> 23:14.561
Yes...

23:15.646 --> 23:16.897
and no.

23:54.268 --> 23:55.269
Ma'am.

23:58.313 --> 24:00.274
- Afternoon, ma'am.
- I need to address the hub.

24:01.024 --> 24:03.110
It seems Cartwright
got out through the car park.

24:03.694 --> 24:04.528
Yeah.

24:04.528 --> 24:06.822
So, I thought we could start
an interim report, ma'am.

24:07.364 --> 24:08.657
Yeah.

24:08.657 --> 24:10.492
I paused comms for your address.

24:15.122 --> 24:18.250
As many of you are aware,
there was an incursion this morning.

24:19.543 --> 24:23.130
An uncleared agent acquired access
to a restricted area.

24:23.130 --> 24:27.593
This was part of an exercise that neither
I nor anyone else in MI5 was aware of.

24:27.593 --> 24:29.178
An exercise we failed.

24:30.262 --> 24:34.641
Pending this, there will be a full review
of security systems.

24:34.641 --> 24:35.726
Back to work.

24:44.776 --> 24:47.029
You're still here. Well done.

24:47.029 --> 24:48.113
Do you mean that?

24:49.198 --> 24:50.782
We've had our differences, Ingrid,

24:50.782 --> 24:54.036
but I would hate to see you forced out
by someone like Judd.

24:54.036 --> 24:57.289
My ultimate loyalty lies
with you and the Service.

24:58.332 --> 25:00.334
I can't believe I'm saying that out loud.

25:02.294 --> 25:05.506
Well, I'm not sure how long I'll last.

25:06.340 --> 25:09.968
Given he now has this failure to use
to push me around.

25:11.678 --> 25:12.763
What does he want?

25:14.556 --> 25:16.266
To bring in the private sector.

25:17.017 --> 25:18.268
Specifically Chieftain.

25:18.268 --> 25:20.562
He'll never get that through. Not now.

25:21.146 --> 25:22.314
There's been a holdup.

25:22.981 --> 25:25.275
Lamb says the tiger team have
their own agenda.

25:25.859 --> 25:27.736
Have they made contact
with him over Standish?

25:27.736 --> 25:29.738
No, he found a flat with their prep.

25:29.738 --> 25:31.573
Apparently they want to see
the Grey Books.

25:32.074 --> 25:33.492
Well, that's never gonna happen.

25:34.451 --> 25:36.370
Have you heard anything from Chieftain
about any of this?

25:36.370 --> 25:39.665
Not a peep. Do you want me to ask?

25:39.665 --> 25:40.749
No.

25:42.334 --> 25:44.169
If there's any mess, it's theirs.

25:44.753 --> 25:46.296
They can clean it up.

25:47.381 --> 25:48.590
That's what I thought.

25:54.596 --> 25:57.558
Thank you, Diana. We have to limit
the collateral damage here.

26:00.602 --> 26:01.436
Poor Standish.

26:01.436 --> 26:05.774
I wasn't meaning her,
I was talking about us. But yes.

26:07.109 --> 26:09.820
Hopefully she'll come through unscathed.

26:19.454 --> 26:20.706
Good afternoon, sir.

26:25.294 --> 26:26.587
Afternoon, Sly.

26:30.382 --> 26:33.010
Fuck me. This is bigger than my flat.

26:33.719 --> 26:35.220
Do you mind if I smoke?

26:36.388 --> 26:37.389
Yes.

26:38.140 --> 26:41.226
So, Sly.

26:42.686 --> 26:46.273
Now, that's a terrible name.
What's it short for? Slime?

26:46.273 --> 26:47.733
I don't know who you are,

26:47.733 --> 26:49.985
but you should know
that I own a private security firm,

26:49.985 --> 26:52.446
which means I have some
very dangerous people in my pay.

26:52.446 --> 26:54.865
Yeah. Too fucking right they're dangerous.

26:55.365 --> 26:58.827
That Sean Donovan, one of your
tiger team, is an absolute fruit basket.

27:00.078 --> 27:01.622
Catherine Standish.

27:01.622 --> 27:04.583
One of my team, in case
you're wondering why I give a shit.

27:04.583 --> 27:05.667
I see.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.753
No, I don't think you do.

27:08.879 --> 27:10.339
Donovan's gone rogue.

27:10.964 --> 27:13.717
Won't let Standish go
until he's had a look at the Grey Books.

27:13.717 --> 27:15.761
Standish should have been released
hours ago.

27:16.345 --> 27:17.513
Oh, well, it hasn't happened.

27:17.513 --> 27:19.306
And what the fuck are the Grey Books?

27:20.766 --> 27:24.686
The Grey Books examine every
conspiracy theory from the last 100 years.

27:24.686 --> 27:28.065
And, you know, surprise, surprise,
decide that they're all bollocks.

27:28.065 --> 27:31.360
But there are some nut cases out there
who think the Grey Books will prove that

27:31.360 --> 27:36.114
Elvis shot JFK,
and Hitler built the pyramids.

27:36.740 --> 27:38.575
I don't know anything about this.

27:38.575 --> 27:41.411
Jesus Christ. This is a fucking disaster.

27:41.411 --> 27:45.040
Yeah, ain't it just.
That's why I thought I'd pay you a visit.

27:46.124 --> 27:47.918
And nothing's happening, you see.

27:47.918 --> 27:52.005
No Standish,
no request for the Grey Books.

27:52.506 --> 27:53.507
Nothing.

27:54.466 --> 27:55.926
I need it all unblocked.

27:56.593 --> 27:58.095
Yeah, speaking of which--

28:01.181 --> 28:02.182
Anyway,

28:03.934 --> 28:05.102
get it sorted.

28:05.936 --> 28:08.480
I imagine neither of us wanna see
the other again.

28:10.190 --> 28:15.070
Fucking hell. Oh, God,
I hope that don't go into the groundwater.

28:15.070 --> 28:17.072
Here, you wanna keep that? Mask the smell?

28:17.573 --> 28:18.740
No.

28:20.033 --> 28:21.410
I advise you to leave quickly.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.496
I'd advise you to leave the windows open.

28:36.091 --> 28:38.093
What the hell happened to you?

28:39.970 --> 28:42.764
Just Duffy.

28:44.391 --> 28:45.475
Then Hobbs.

28:45.475 --> 28:46.935
What? Did they beat you up?

28:48.604 --> 28:49.730
Yes, obviously.

28:50.314 --> 28:51.982
- Wow.
- So why are we here then?

28:52.858 --> 28:54.943
Lamb wants us to get Chieftain's file
on the op,

28:54.943 --> 28:56.945
background on Donovan and the team.

28:56.945 --> 28:59.239
Seems that they have their own agenda.

28:59.990 --> 29:02.534
- Are they gonna give that to us?
- Yeah, they are. We're MI5.

29:02.534 --> 29:03.869
Who the fuck are they?

29:04.369 --> 29:07.831
A multimillion-pound security firm
with connections to the Home Secretary.

29:08.498 --> 29:11.710
Well, I don't give a shit.
Bankrupting myself having four coffees,

29:11.710 --> 29:16.006
hanging out here watching these cocks
swan in and out. So, come on.

29:22.429 --> 29:23.931
Hey, listen, fuckers.

29:23.931 --> 29:27.142
Yeah, you've kept me waiting there
for hours, and I want answers.

29:27.768 --> 29:30.562
You people-- You can't put me
through the wringer like that, yeah,

29:30.562 --> 29:33.148
and expect it to be all smoothed over
with a fucking phone call.

29:33.148 --> 29:36.485
I want money. I want moola, moola.
You understand? I don't--

29:36.485 --> 29:38.028
- I know, actually--
- Hey! Whoa.

29:38.028 --> 29:40.697
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, my God. River.

29:41.406 --> 29:43.408
- And the lovely Louisa.
- Go fuck yourself.

29:44.159 --> 29:46.328
Need to speak to whoever's
in charge of this morning's op.

29:46.328 --> 29:48.455
- I'll see if they're free.
- What? Okay. What?

29:48.455 --> 29:51.750
So you jump when MI5 ask,
but Joe Public can go whistle, can he?

29:51.750 --> 29:52.918
- Fuck's sake.
- Shut up.

29:54.002 --> 29:55.003
Listen.

29:55.546 --> 29:58.715
So, you-- you know it was a tiger team?

29:58.715 --> 30:01.385
I do now, yeah. I didn't when
I was standing on that bridge

30:01.385 --> 30:03.262
with a fucking sniper sight on my chest.

30:03.262 --> 30:06.014
These people--
They've been paid a fortune for this op.

30:06.014 --> 30:08.517
And after what I've been through,
I want a taste.

30:09.393 --> 30:10.477
You should get some too.

30:10.978 --> 30:13.564
Hey, do you wanna go in together?
Whatever they offer we ask for triple.

30:13.564 --> 30:15.190
No, I'm fine, mate.

30:15.190 --> 30:16.483
- Hey.
- I'm here to do a job.

30:16.483 --> 30:19.278
Hey, I know we've had our history, right?

30:19.278 --> 30:21.655
But for once we're on the same side.
We both got played.

30:21.655 --> 30:23.073
You always get played, Spider.

30:23.073 --> 30:24.199
There's a good point.

30:24.741 --> 30:25.993
Did you get the file?

30:26.952 --> 30:28.579
No. But I coulda done.

30:28.579 --> 30:30.330
Lamb pulled me out.

30:31.915 --> 30:33.667
How's your sister then? Is she okay?

30:34.168 --> 30:35.919
She's fine, mate. Standish okay?

30:37.713 --> 30:39.882
Well, there's been a bit of a holdup.

30:39.882 --> 30:43.510
But of course can't go into that
because you're not in the Service anymore.

30:44.094 --> 30:46.180
- So. Yeah.
- That's told me.

30:48.223 --> 30:49.558
Talking of which--

30:51.018 --> 30:54.062
I know we never had a chance to chat after

30:54.062 --> 30:55.939
- that whole disaster with the Russians.
- No, save it.

30:55.939 --> 30:58.066
No, this is long overdue, and I--

30:59.526 --> 31:02.863
I feel terrible that I didn't reach out
and say this earlier.

31:02.863 --> 31:03.989
But...

31:05.490 --> 31:06.575
I forgive you.

31:08.619 --> 31:09.995
- Excuse me?
- I got shot

31:09.995 --> 31:13.081
while you were running security,
but I forgive you.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.086
Okay. Okay.

31:18.086 --> 31:20.631
- He's not worth it, is he?
- You can go through now.

31:20.631 --> 31:23.842
The Command and Control Executive Officer
is ready to speak to you.

31:23.842 --> 31:25.594
God, that's a twat-y title.

31:26.762 --> 31:28.972
- That's the private sector for you.
- If you'd like to follow me.

31:30.766 --> 31:32.601
Mr. Webb,
you can come through now as well.

31:37.439 --> 31:39.066
So you were a while in hospital then?

31:40.192 --> 31:41.360
Couple of months.

31:43.237 --> 31:44.446
Lucky for some.

31:46.573 --> 31:48.242
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

31:50.077 --> 31:52.329
I heard you quit
before they could fire you.

31:52.329 --> 31:55.999
Not quite in that order.
They gave me the option.

31:56.500 --> 31:59.211
Slough House or leave the Service.
So I left.

32:02.005 --> 32:04.424
- No offense.
- Literally none taken.

32:16.478 --> 32:18.188
So where are you working now then?

32:18.188 --> 32:19.398
Well...

32:21.859 --> 32:22.860
here.

32:23.735 --> 32:28.448
Say hello to your Command
and Control Executive Officer.

32:43.380 --> 32:46.425
You fucking-- Fuck off.

32:46.425 --> 32:47.634
I weren't lying.

32:47.634 --> 32:51.138
I am here for compensation.
A big, fat fucking bonus.

32:56.643 --> 32:58.562
I should split it with ya, but I won't.

32:58.562 --> 33:00.272
How'd you know we were coming?

33:00.272 --> 33:02.774
Didn't.
Saw you outside staking the place out,

33:02.774 --> 33:06.695
told everyone to play along
if you came in and you did...

33:06.695 --> 33:08.197
with Cart-wrong.

33:08.697 --> 33:11.700
- The gods are smiling on me today.
- Oh, my God, you're so pathetic.

33:11.700 --> 33:12.618
- Am I?
- Yeah.

33:12.618 --> 33:17.122
With my six-figure private sector salary,
company car, and massive penis.

33:18.665 --> 33:23.545
Thank you, River.
Thank you. You were magnificent.

33:23.545 --> 33:25.839
Judd wanted Chieftain to run
a tiger team on the Park.

33:25.839 --> 33:27.633
They reached out to me as an ex-employee

33:27.633 --> 33:31.887
and set me the task of selecting
the biggest sucker on the books.

33:31.887 --> 33:34.264
I got to say, it didn't take long.

33:34.264 --> 33:36.183
R to the I to the V-E-R.

33:36.183 --> 33:37.351
God, you know what?

33:37.351 --> 33:40.187
I almost feel guilty about accepting
that huge consultancy fee

33:40.187 --> 33:42.064
for literally a minute's work.

33:42.064 --> 33:44.942
I knew you'd take the bait again.

33:44.942 --> 33:47.486
Tear off and try and be a hero.

33:49.112 --> 33:52.074
River, please believe me.
Please believe me.

33:52.074 --> 33:55.494
They're gonna kill my sister
and her-- her-- her kids.

33:55.494 --> 33:58.539
Rafer, you fucker.
Come here, mate. Come here.

33:59.456 --> 34:00.791
Oh, mate.

34:01.917 --> 34:04.169
Rafer was the sniper. Show 'em your rifle.

34:08.090 --> 34:09.341
Nice one, mate.

34:09.341 --> 34:10.509
Oh, God.

34:11.134 --> 34:13.219
You don't even have a sister, do you?

34:13.219 --> 34:17.431
No, I do. But we haven't spoken
in years. She's a total bitch.

34:17.431 --> 34:19.685
Are you gonna give us your files
on Donovan and the team?

34:22.688 --> 34:24.857
Nah. You can kiss my unwashed anus.

34:24.857 --> 34:27.234
Je-- They're not letting her go, Spider.

34:27.234 --> 34:28.777
All under control.

34:28.777 --> 34:30.487
Now, if you'll excuse me,

34:30.487 --> 34:33.866
the boss and I have a lunch
with the Home Secretary.

34:34.449 --> 34:39.580
I'm gonna be part of an advisory committee
on improving MI5's efficiency.

34:39.580 --> 34:42.416
Do you wanna know my first recommendation?
It's a good one.

34:43.917 --> 34:45.293
Shut down Slough House.

34:47.045 --> 34:49.797
- I'm gonna fucking break your neck you f--
- All right. Let's go.

34:49.797 --> 34:51.717
You should be thanking me.

34:51.717 --> 34:54.969
You don't want to be there, River, mate.
Time to move on to your true calling.

34:54.969 --> 34:57.306
Shoving fruit up your arse on OnlyFans.

34:59.433 --> 35:01.268
If you ever want a job, Guy,
just drop me a line.

35:01.268 --> 35:03.812
You'll at least get an interview.
Microphone drop.

35:04.855 --> 35:06.064
It's mic drop you--

35:09.610 --> 35:13.363
Yeah! Yes, mate. Love it.

35:13.363 --> 35:15.490
- Fucking Spider.
- Fucking you.

35:16.491 --> 35:18.410
- What?
- It was Spider, again.

35:18.410 --> 35:20.495
- You should have known.
- What do you mean I should've known?

35:20.495 --> 35:22.414
- So fucking humiliating.
- How did--

35:23.707 --> 35:24.958
Literally the number of times

35:24.958 --> 35:27.753
I wanted to punch him in the face
and that-- It was just better.

35:27.753 --> 35:30.923
It was better than a punch in the face.
It was better than a dart in the face.

35:30.923 --> 35:35.219
Do you know what I'm saying?
You just missed Cartwright. It was butane.

35:58.659 --> 36:00.994
I have just been threatened
by a Jackson fucking Lamb

36:00.994 --> 36:02.829
because Standish is still being held.

36:05.916 --> 36:08.126
- Oh, that?
- What do you mean, "Oh, that"?

36:08.794 --> 36:10.712
You told me it had
all gone like clockwork.

36:10.712 --> 36:12.297
It has and it will.

36:13.006 --> 36:16.718
Nothing is gonna happen to Standish
or our guy that they're holding.

36:17.678 --> 36:18.679
What guy?

36:20.347 --> 36:23.934
Jesus. This gets worse and worse.
Tell me where we're at. No bullshit.

36:23.934 --> 36:25.185
It's actually quite--

36:25.185 --> 36:30.148
Anyway, they demanded a meet with me,
due to begin shortly,

36:30.148 --> 36:33.235
from where I will escort them
to have a look at something

36:33.235 --> 36:36.613
- called the Grey Books.
- Yes. Lamb told me about the Grey Books.

36:37.239 --> 36:38.365
How does Lamb know?

36:39.032 --> 36:41.076
Oh, God knows.
He seems to know everything.

36:42.327 --> 36:43.579
What are you going to do?

36:44.621 --> 36:46.915
Well, not show, obviously.

36:49.793 --> 36:53.338
They have two fucking hostages,
and you propose to stand them up?

36:53.338 --> 36:56.175
There is no way MI5 are gonna
open up the Grey Books for them.

36:56.175 --> 36:58.427
And they're not
actually gonna kill anyone.

36:58.427 --> 37:01.430
They'll realize they're making twats
of themselves and release her soon enough.

37:01.430 --> 37:03.432
You're going to the meet.
I want this sorted.

37:04.141 --> 37:05.851
We have our lunch with Judd.

37:05.851 --> 37:08.228
No. I have a lunch with Judd.

37:09.229 --> 37:12.149
You're not going unless our guy
and Standish are both released.

37:12.733 --> 37:14.276
How am I supposed to do that?

37:14.276 --> 37:17.696
You're ex-MI5.
Pull some strings or pay them off.

37:18.280 --> 37:21.325
- With what?
- Your fucking fee. I don't give a shit.

37:27.915 --> 37:29.917
Donovan really believes some of this shit.

37:31.793 --> 37:35.923
As do I, by the way.
There's no way we've been to the Moon.

37:38.175 --> 37:41.678
He posts on conspiracy sites
under a handle, obviously.

37:42.596 --> 37:44.431
I might have even interacted with him.

37:47.392 --> 37:51.188
Where would a twat
like Peter Judd have lunch?

38:34.147 --> 38:35.148
What's that?

38:35.649 --> 38:38.402
That's my beautiful bonus,
which I'm giving you.

38:39.486 --> 38:40.487
It's not about money.

38:40.487 --> 38:42.865
Fuck off. It's always about money.

38:44.700 --> 38:47.953
By the way, did you bribe Taverner
to ring me with that reference?

38:48.662 --> 38:51.248
She got me the job at Chieftain.
Christ knows why she wanted you.

38:51.248 --> 38:53.876
- I want to see the Grey Books.
- Not gonna happen.

38:55.836 --> 38:58.797
- Then we have a problem.
- Okay. I've tried the carrot.

38:58.797 --> 39:01.466
- Do you want me to get out the stick?
- I'm the one with the stick.

39:01.967 --> 39:05.179
We have two hostages. If you wanna see
them again, you know what you have to do.

39:05.179 --> 39:07.055
Sorry. Can we just cut the bullshit, okay?

39:07.055 --> 39:09.433
They're not hostages,
and you're not gonna do anything to them.

39:09.933 --> 39:12.603
It's just a game, mate.
A big fucking stupid game.

39:12.603 --> 39:16.231
Now, I don't know why you're doing this,
and I don't care, but I want it to stop.

39:18.692 --> 39:21.528
Don't walk away from me, dickhead. Stop.

39:22.696 --> 39:24.740
I command you to stop.

39:27.993 --> 39:30.579
I'm late for a lunch
at Anna Livia's with the Home Secretary.

39:30.579 --> 39:32.539
I can't show my face
until Standish is released.

39:32.539 --> 39:34.750
Now stop fucking around
and tell me where she is.

39:37.211 --> 39:38.462
Go to your lunch.

39:39.755 --> 39:41.298
Enjoy your hors d'oeuvres.

39:42.007 --> 39:44.927
But don't play the big man,
you slick twat.

39:46.136 --> 39:49.473
I'm not gonna take lessons on being a man
from someone who couldn't hold it together

39:49.473 --> 39:51.808
when their secret fuck buddy
killed herself.

39:51.808 --> 39:54.728
Yeah, I read your file, twat.

39:56.230 --> 39:57.940
Now listen to me. I--

40:01.026 --> 40:02.486
And I'd advise you to stay down.

40:06.949 --> 40:07.950
Hey.

40:16.917 --> 40:17.751
Hey.

40:18.335 --> 40:20.420
You sure it makes sense to keep Tearney?

40:20.420 --> 40:22.339
Well, for the time being.

40:22.339 --> 40:26.093
We need to make sure the cultural changes
you propose are bedded in enough

40:26.093 --> 40:28.387
that her successor cannot reverse them.

40:29.054 --> 40:31.765
Your guest, Mr. Webb, is here.

40:31.765 --> 40:32.933
Send him over.

40:33.475 --> 40:35.644
I reminded him
the dress code is smart-casual,

40:35.644 --> 40:37.896
but he was quite curt and dismissive.

40:38.397 --> 40:42.150
I will allow it because he's your guest,
but if you could have a word...

40:46.321 --> 40:47.906
What the fuck are you doing here?

40:47.906 --> 40:50.534
I have to keep going higher up
to get this sorted out.

40:50.534 --> 40:53.620
Fuck me. Every ponce and his brother.

40:54.746 --> 40:57.249
I thought the tiger team operation
was successfully concluded.

40:57.833 --> 41:00.752
It is. Small hiccup.
Webb is dealing with it.

41:01.336 --> 41:05.048
Well, once you've delivered her back,
I'll leave you be. Give us a chip.

41:06.300 --> 41:08.510
I'm not sure we've ever properly met.

41:09.761 --> 41:12.431
Yeah, well, it feels like we have.

41:13.432 --> 41:15.642
I've met plenty of your sort before.

41:16.143 --> 41:17.936
If you've come to tell me
what you think of me,

41:17.936 --> 41:20.230
I should warn you,
I have an incredibly thick skin.

41:20.230 --> 41:23.567
So your barbs might not wound
as much as you hope.

41:24.067 --> 41:27.738
I'm sorry to disappoint.
I don't think of you at all.

41:32.576 --> 41:34.411
Christ, that's good.

41:34.912 --> 41:36.038
How much does that cost?

41:36.038 --> 41:38.040
More than your monthly salary.

41:38.624 --> 41:41.502
What do you want? Other than Standish.

41:41.502 --> 41:43.253
I just wanna be left alone.

41:44.004 --> 41:45.881
But then you came along
and fucked with my chi.

41:45.881 --> 41:49.468
You see, Standish runs my diary.

41:49.468 --> 41:51.845
Now, without her, I don't really know
what I'm supposed to be doing.

41:51.845 --> 41:56.266
So I've got all this spare time
to come and fuck with you.

42:17.287 --> 42:18.539
Check his pulse.

42:20.207 --> 42:21.208
I can't find a pulse.

42:22.042 --> 42:23.669
His airways are clear,
but he's not breathing.

42:24.253 --> 42:25.754
Jesus Christ. That's Webb.

42:27.798 --> 42:29.132
Who was it who said,

42:29.132 --> 42:32.511
"You cannot reason with a tiger
when your head is in its mouth"?

42:32.511 --> 42:33.595
Churchill.

42:38.725 --> 42:40.227
But that won't be Webb calling,

42:40.227 --> 42:42.938
seeing as he's now
outside impersonating roadkill.

42:43.647 --> 42:47.025
No, that'll be your tiger team,
looking for your head.
