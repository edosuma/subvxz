WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:08.137
-You don't
even know Heather!

00:08.241 --> 00:09.551
-I know, I know!
I-look, I can't--

00:09.655 --> 00:13.448
-Nora, can I come in?

00:13.551 --> 00:14.724
- Come in.

00:16.862 --> 00:18.689
- Hey, Princess.
- Hey.

00:18.793 --> 00:20.103
- You in the middle
of something?

00:20.206 --> 00:21.482
- TV.

00:21.586 --> 00:24.206
- I just wanted to talk to you.

00:26.551 --> 00:28.758
You know I've been going out
with Brenda for a while now.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.137
- Who's that?

00:30.241 --> 00:32.896
-I think it's time
that you guys met each other.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.517
I don't know, this
could be serious.

00:34.620 --> 00:35.586
-What does it mean...

00:35.689 --> 00:36.931
What do you mean,
it's getting serious?

00:37.034 --> 00:38.310
Serious, serious? Or--

00:38.413 --> 00:40.965
- She wants to come over
tonight and make dinner for us.

00:41.068 --> 00:44.034
- How well do you
know this "Brrrenda"?

00:44.137 --> 00:46.586
- Just one dinner, Nora.

00:46.689 --> 00:48.275
- Fine.

00:49.896 --> 00:54.620
But don't be surprised if
she takes a tumble down a well.

00:54.724 --> 00:56.137
- What?
- What?

00:56.241 --> 00:58.310
- Did you just say...
No, please, Nora, please.

00:58.413 --> 01:00.827
- Uh oh, I just got my period.
Gotta run.

01:11.620 --> 01:15.034
- Remember when kale was
just used in deli displays?

01:15.137 --> 01:17.034
This vegetable's
come a long way.

01:17.137 --> 01:19.586
- Yeah, heh. Sure.

01:19.689 --> 01:21.344
- Are you okay?

01:22.310 --> 01:24.655
You've been out of it all day.

01:24.758 --> 01:25.931
- I'm sorry.

01:26.034 --> 01:28.413
I'm just a little nervous
about you meeting Nora.

01:28.517 --> 01:30.724
I'm not ready for you to die.

01:30.827 --> 01:33.551
Mmm, I'm not ready
for you to dine.

01:33.655 --> 01:36.310
- Wally, you are being dramatic.

01:36.413 --> 01:38.241
- No, listen to me.

01:38.344 --> 01:41.931
Nora has a history of
terrorizing my exes.

01:42.034 --> 01:43.896
- No. Please, no.

01:49.344 --> 01:51.586
- Nora, you did this!

01:55.310 --> 01:57.689
- I never figured out how she
was able to get Lisa arrested

01:57.793 --> 01:59.172
for tax fraud.

01:59.275 --> 02:01.034
- Um, what about the
woman in the wheelchair

02:01.137 --> 02:02.344
that she disemboweled?

02:02.448 --> 02:03.965
That seems more concerning.

02:04.068 --> 02:06.655
- Point is, Nora's always
been very weird about

02:06.758 --> 02:09.379
the new relationship
conversation.

02:09.482 --> 02:11.896
So--
--heads up.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.758
- Yeah, but Wally, you've
gotta give her credit.

02:13.862 --> 02:15.103
Nora's an adult now.

02:15.206 --> 02:17.551
She's not some
traumatized, scheming,

02:17.655 --> 02:19.724
sociopathic seven-year-old.

02:22.344 --> 02:25.620
-How is she this clean?
It's impossible.

02:35.137 --> 02:36.620
- No.

02:42.310 --> 02:44.344
- Oh, stop pacing.
You're making me nervous.

02:44.448 --> 02:46.137
- I can't help it, Bren.

02:47.517 --> 02:49.965
- Oh shit, here she comes.

02:58.724 --> 03:00.551
- I'm Brenda!

03:00.655 --> 03:04.137
So nice to finally
meet you, Nora.

03:04.241 --> 03:07.000
- I only go by my screenname,
Lil'spicybitch69.

03:07.103 --> 03:09.482
- Oh.

03:09.586 --> 03:12.379
-Oh, Brenda,
did you make this chicken?

03:12.482 --> 03:14.206
It's so good!

03:14.310 --> 03:16.793
- I did!
I'm so glad you like it.

03:16.896 --> 03:19.310
- Mm-hmm.

03:19.413 --> 03:23.931
- So, your dad tells me that you
played the trumpet in school?

03:24.034 --> 03:26.379
I myself played the French horn.
-Cool.

03:26.482 --> 03:27.793
Yeah, the French horn
is known as

03:27.896 --> 03:29.689
the inferior section
of the brass family,

03:29.793 --> 03:32.103
specifically because
it not only looks like shit,

03:32.206 --> 03:34.413
tastes like shit,
sounds like shit--

03:34.517 --> 03:36.586
- Nora, you know, be nice, huh?

03:36.689 --> 03:38.379
-No, no, no, no...
She's right, she's right.

03:38.482 --> 03:39.758
You know, my--my son, Chuck,

03:39.862 --> 03:41.379
he's the musical one
in the family.

03:41.482 --> 03:43.068
You know, I wish you
could've met him tonight.

03:43.172 --> 03:45.620
He's--he's doing
his DJ residency.

03:45.724 --> 03:47.724
- He's a pretty good DJ.
- Yeah.

03:47.827 --> 03:49.275
- You're gonna like him.
He's a cool guy.

03:52.689 --> 03:53.896
- I just wanted
to make a toast.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.448
- Oh.

03:55.551 --> 03:56.965
To nothing.

03:58.241 --> 03:59.517
- Here, here.

04:02.137 --> 04:03.724
- Look at that picture!

04:03.827 --> 04:06.413
Is that you?
Oh, how cute!

04:06.517 --> 04:07.862
-When she
was a little kid,

04:07.965 --> 04:11.413
we used to spend the summers
upstate at The Lone Ranger.

04:11.517 --> 04:12.793
It's a dude ranch.

04:12.896 --> 04:14.586
- Plus I lost my
hymen virginity there.

04:17.275 --> 04:19.827
- Oh.
- Trotting.

04:19.931 --> 04:23.137
- Why don't we go back?
-Oh, no.

04:23.241 --> 04:25.517
-That'd be great!
We could all go this weekend.

04:25.620 --> 04:28.551
It'll be like a
spontaneous trip.

04:28.655 --> 04:32.310
- I'm busy.
But Nora will go with you.

04:32.413 --> 04:33.517
- Why
would you do that?

04:33.620 --> 04:36.448
It's a good idea.

04:36.551 --> 04:38.448
- You know
I don't wanna go.

04:38.551 --> 04:39.758
- Hey, I think
that's a great idea.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.000
- Dad!
I don't wanna go.

04:41.103 --> 04:43.344
- This weekend.
Just the three of us, huh?

04:43.448 --> 04:46.827
- Ha-ha! Here, here! Mm.

04:51.344 --> 04:54.448
Well? What did
you think of Brenda?

04:54.551 --> 04:55.793
- They're moving too fast.

04:55.896 --> 05:00.068
A family vacation?
Like this already?

05:00.172 --> 05:03.172
I have intuition, and I
know when something's fishy.

05:03.275 --> 05:04.551
And this is fishy.

05:04.655 --> 05:07.344
And--and verifiably she
is trying to steal my skin.

05:07.448 --> 05:09.482
I know she is.

05:09.586 --> 05:12.620
- You always get
like this, Nora.

05:12.724 --> 05:14.862
I know you have a good heart.

05:14.965 --> 05:18.551
But sometimes this
evil little kid comes out.

05:18.655 --> 05:20.827
- You know that wasn't me.

05:20.931 --> 05:22.931
It...

05:23.034 --> 05:24.241
It was Toeknee.

05:24.344 --> 05:26.517
- Who?
- Toeknee?

05:26.620 --> 05:29.206
My...imaginary friend?
You remember?

05:29.310 --> 05:32.689
- Stop blaming your imaginary
friend for wreaking havoc on

05:32.793 --> 05:34.551
your dad's love life.

05:34.655 --> 05:36.758
- Toeknee's real, okay?

05:36.862 --> 05:39.206
And you know
that he only appears

05:39.310 --> 05:41.310
when my dad gets
new girlfriends.

05:41.413 --> 05:43.000
And I don't know
where he comes from.

05:43.103 --> 05:45.896
- Be a good girl, okay?

05:50.034 --> 05:53.551
- Fine! But only
because I love you.

05:53.655 --> 05:56.103
Not all these other
motherfuckers out here.

05:56.206 --> 05:57.965
- I'm gonna take this.

06:05.655 --> 06:07.379
- Yeah, well, it
smells the same.

06:07.482 --> 06:12.068
- Okay! Yeah, I love it.
It's so cute!

06:12.172 --> 06:14.448
-- You like it?
-- Yeah!

06:14.551 --> 06:16.000
- Hey, I know.

06:16.103 --> 06:17.448
Let's leave everything here
and go get something to eat.

06:17.551 --> 06:18.655
I'm starving.

06:18.758 --> 06:20.655
- Oh, yeah!
I'm sure the food's great.

06:24.896 --> 06:26.758
- Oh, I'm all right.
You guys can go ahead.

06:26.862 --> 06:28.827
- Are you sure you're
all right, Princess?

06:28.931 --> 06:32.896
- Yeah, but I already
feel like I have to do...

06:33.000 --> 06:34.172
some poop.

06:34.275 --> 06:36.896
- Okay.
- See you later.

06:50.896 --> 06:54.275
- Long time, no see!

06:56.482 --> 06:57.827
- Toeknee?

07:00.862 --> 07:03.448
- No, no, no, it can't be.
It can't be.

07:03.551 --> 07:05.931
- 'Tis I, shitbird!

07:06.034 --> 07:07.586
- What are you
doing here, Toeknee?

07:07.689 --> 07:11.379
- Okay, first, it's Toe-Knee.

07:11.482 --> 07:13.517
I can tell when you're spelling
it wrong in your head, kids.

07:13.620 --> 07:15.000
Don't belittle me.

07:15.103 --> 07:19.172
- Okay, you, you, need to go,
because I am going to go to

07:19.275 --> 07:21.655
a fucking mental institution
because of you!

07:21.758 --> 07:25.758
- Hey, there's a reason
I'm here and you know it.

07:25.862 --> 07:29.068
Come on, saddlebags!
Remember all of our good times?

07:34.103 --> 07:36.068
- Nora, you did this!

07:39.620 --> 07:41.344
- Right.
And then I get in trouble

07:41.448 --> 07:44.482
for all your
little shenanigans, okay?

07:44.586 --> 07:46.172
My dad almost went on Maury!

07:46.275 --> 07:47.862
- Oh, I would've loved that!

07:47.965 --> 07:50.000
- This is a bad
trip and I gotta go.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.137
I gotta go.

07:52.241 --> 07:55.896
- Back in the day, we didn't
have all of your technologies.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.758
What we did, we did--

07:57.862 --> 08:02.034
- Butta, butta, butta,
butta, butta.

08:02.137 --> 08:04.448
All right, that was great!
Thank you for coming.

08:08.034 --> 08:09.655
- I like butter.
-Ah, this looks good.

08:09.758 --> 08:12.344
-Yeah.

08:12.448 --> 08:15.482
- Greetings!

08:15.586 --> 08:17.000
- Sweetie, are you okay?

08:17.103 --> 08:19.172
- I'm okay. Mm.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.482
Can you leave?

08:23.586 --> 08:24.793
- You want me to leave?

08:24.896 --> 08:28.275
- No, no, no, no.

08:30.172 --> 08:32.413
- Nora, come on.

08:32.517 --> 08:33.517
It wasn't me.

08:33.620 --> 08:34.551
It wasn't.
It was that guy.

08:38.517 --> 08:40.068
- That's a stinky one.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.965
- Stop farting,
you fart fucker!

08:59.379 --> 09:00.965
-She's unique.

09:01.896 --> 09:03.758
- Oh, man!

09:03.862 --> 09:06.241
That was classic!

09:08.103 --> 09:09.586
- Toeknee?

09:09.689 --> 09:11.655
You need to leave right now.

09:11.758 --> 09:15.000
- Why?
We're having so much fun.

09:15.103 --> 09:16.862
And that Brenda,
whoa, she is trouble.

09:16.965 --> 09:18.689
- I promised my
grandma I'd be good.

09:18.793 --> 09:21.758
And also, Brenda?
She's actually pretty nice.

09:21.862 --> 09:25.137
- Hey, she only seems nice now.

09:25.241 --> 09:27.758
But that's all because
she, you know...

09:27.862 --> 09:31.000
I don't know.
- What?

09:31.103 --> 09:33.068
- I don't know, maybe she,
like, wants to steal your skin.

09:33.172 --> 09:34.241
- What?

09:34.344 --> 09:36.620
- She's going to steal
your skin, you idiot!

09:36.724 --> 09:39.206
And then she's probably
gonna ship your ass

09:39.310 --> 09:41.620
off to boarding school
in Middle Earth.

09:41.724 --> 09:43.206
- Where's that?

09:43.310 --> 09:46.965
- Then she's gonna start pulling
off all your old pictures until

09:47.068 --> 09:50.344
your daddy don't even
remember you no more.

09:50.448 --> 09:55.586
But, since you don't need me,
I'll be going, I guess.

09:55.689 --> 09:57.586
- No, no, don't go, don't go.

09:57.689 --> 09:59.655
I think I do--I do need you.

09:59.758 --> 10:02.344
I need you.

10:02.448 --> 10:05.551
- I know, baby. I know.

10:05.655 --> 10:08.827
- Okay, Toeknee, don't call me
"baby" and pet me like that.

10:08.931 --> 10:11.551
- Can I call you broad?
- No!

10:11.655 --> 10:13.068
- Sweet cheeks?
- No!

10:13.172 --> 10:15.275
- Dulce de leche?

10:15.379 --> 10:17.344
- Okay, I'll allow that one.

10:17.448 --> 10:20.482
- You were feeling that one.
Okay, there we go--

10:20.586 --> 10:21.517
- Can you--

10:29.448 --> 10:31.724
-- Stand back, stand back.
-- Okay, you go, you go.

10:31.827 --> 10:33.482
- Okie-dokie, poodle.

10:33.586 --> 10:35.310
Time to break
these lovebirds up.

10:35.413 --> 10:37.310
Heh, heh, heh...

10:37.413 --> 10:38.310
- What is that thing?

10:38.413 --> 10:39.827
- You know, it's
for, like, camping.

10:39.931 --> 10:42.103
You put it out in the woods.
It makes, like, predator noises.

10:42.206 --> 10:45.448
Look, coyote, fox,

10:45.551 --> 10:48.034
wolf, baby coyote.

10:48.137 --> 10:50.620
It's got all manner of bears.
- Okay.

10:50.724 --> 10:53.620
How is that gonna
help us get to Brenda?

10:53.724 --> 10:56.758
- Oh, you'll find out.

10:56.862 --> 10:59.586
There's porridge,
the sound of porridge.

10:59.689 --> 11:00.793
- Shut the fuck up.

11:00.896 --> 11:03.586
- You shut the fuck up!
What the hell?

11:41.793 --> 11:43.241
- Oh, hey, you've been
in there a long time.

11:43.344 --> 11:45.482
Is everything--oh, wow.

11:45.586 --> 11:48.068
- I feel so light.

11:48.172 --> 11:51.482
Usually when I travel, every
bowel movement is a blessing.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.206
But I just had a miracle.

11:53.310 --> 11:56.448
- Yeah, ee--you're
really glowing, Bren.

11:56.551 --> 11:57.793
You look beautiful.

11:57.896 --> 12:00.551
- Hey, where did I put my bag?

12:00.655 --> 12:02.034
-Oh, it was right there.

12:02.137 --> 12:04.862
Oh, no, did we leave the
door unlocked or something?

12:08.448 --> 12:11.344
- Mm. What a shame.

12:11.448 --> 12:13.862
- No, it doesn't matter!
Doesn't matter!

12:13.965 --> 12:15.931
Wherever my clothes are,
I wish them peace.

12:17.206 --> 12:19.000
- Hey, you know, they
got a gift shop here.

12:19.103 --> 12:20.620
Maybe they got something.

12:20.724 --> 12:21.655
- Yes.

12:21.758 --> 12:23.241
- Gift shop?

12:23.344 --> 12:27.827
Hope you're okay lookin'
like a grade-A dork, Brenda!

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
- Howdy, I'm Cowboy Joe.
You must be new in town.

12:35.103 --> 12:37.000
I'll tell ya, Bren, you look
like a completely different

12:37.103 --> 12:39.586
person in that get-up.

12:39.689 --> 12:42.620
It's almost like I'm cheatin'.

12:42.724 --> 12:44.344
- That's not funny, Wally.

12:44.448 --> 12:46.448
- Okay, BoCankles,
we gotta up our game.

12:46.551 --> 12:47.689
None of this is working.

12:47.793 --> 12:49.655
Your dad's more into
Brenda than ever.

12:56.413 --> 12:58.137
- I got an idea.

12:58.241 --> 12:59.896
-Oh, thank you.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.586
Do you have butter lettuce?

13:01.689 --> 13:03.655
- Ask them if they got rats.

13:03.758 --> 13:05.034
- They--they don't--
- Dead rats.

13:05.137 --> 13:06.862
- Shut the hell up.
- With the ranch sauce.

13:06.965 --> 13:08.517
- I don't want--he
doesn't want rats.

13:08.620 --> 13:09.689
I don't want rats.

13:13.448 --> 13:15.620
- Lettuce is so crisp.

13:15.724 --> 13:17.482
- Hello, Wally.

13:17.586 --> 13:19.413
It is I, Deborah.

13:19.517 --> 13:21.689
The woman with whom
you had an affair?

13:21.793 --> 13:22.965
- I'm sorry, what?

13:23.068 --> 13:24.862
- Yeah, we met, you know,
on the biblical sense.

13:24.965 --> 13:26.413
You don't recall?

13:26.517 --> 13:28.586
- Ah, more vigor, Debbie!

13:28.689 --> 13:29.965
She was better in rehearsal.

13:30.068 --> 13:31.896
- The touching of our bodies
together, you know, uh,

13:32.000 --> 13:33.655
so to speak, as it were?

13:33.758 --> 13:35.275
All right, yeah, come on, Wally.

13:35.379 --> 13:37.896
Don't make me say it.
I don't relish being crude.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.862
- Oh my--Dad!

13:39.965 --> 13:42.310
Did you cheat on Brenda?

13:42.413 --> 13:43.793
- Oh, oh shit!

13:43.896 --> 13:45.517
No one likes a cheater!

13:45.620 --> 13:47.758
- No, no, no, no, no!

13:47.862 --> 13:50.000
- Oh, wait!

13:50.103 --> 13:52.896
Is this this
colonial roleplaying

13:53.000 --> 13:55.862
experimental acting thingy?

13:57.310 --> 13:58.896
- You're very watchable.
You're very watchable.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.034
That's rare.

14:00.137 --> 14:02.275
- Watchable?
What, is she high?

14:02.379 --> 14:03.862
- Nobody ever tells
me anything nice.

14:03.965 --> 14:05.137
-Oh, no,
you're very good.

14:05.241 --> 14:06.068
-Oh my god--

14:06.172 --> 14:08.241
- This is so wild!

14:08.344 --> 14:10.517
Brenda, she's,
like, untouchable!

14:10.620 --> 14:13.000
- Well, she does have a
very likeable personality.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.344
- Hey, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

14:15.448 --> 14:16.310
- No, I'm not.

14:16.413 --> 14:17.586
- Then let's both
say it on three.

14:17.689 --> 14:19.551
One, two, three-- murder!

14:19.655 --> 14:21.137
- What?

14:21.241 --> 14:22.931
I'm not killing Brenda.

14:23.034 --> 14:25.137
Are you fucking crazy?

14:25.241 --> 14:27.586
- Crazy would be
pulling more baby pranks

14:27.689 --> 14:29.758
and expecting them to work.

14:29.862 --> 14:32.344
Murder is the least crazy thing,

14:32.448 --> 14:34.000
especially for
this kind of threat.

14:34.103 --> 14:35.448
- Brenda is not a threat.

14:35.551 --> 14:38.034
She's, like, the
nicest person ever.

14:38.137 --> 14:40.827
- She needs to go.

14:40.931 --> 14:43.103
- No, Toeknee, I'm
drawing the line, there.

14:43.206 --> 14:44.758
And you should draw a line too.

14:44.862 --> 14:48.655
- Yeah, you're right.

14:48.758 --> 14:50.379
- Thank you.

14:50.482 --> 14:51.379
- Psych!

14:51.482 --> 14:54.172
- Toeknee, no!

14:54.275 --> 14:55.551
- Sucker!

15:01.793 --> 15:03.172
- Where are you, Toeknee!?

15:03.275 --> 15:05.448
- Looking for me, bird tits?

15:05.551 --> 15:06.517
- Put that down.

15:06.620 --> 15:07.862
You don't know how
to use that thing.

15:07.965 --> 15:10.551
- So? I can figure it out.
It's called YouTube, bitch.

15:10.655 --> 15:12.241
- Oh, you got a computer?

15:14.379 --> 15:17.413
- What the hell?
We're on the same side, here!

15:17.517 --> 15:20.896
I'm trying to protect you
from that soul-sucking woman

15:21.000 --> 15:23.137
who's got your dad
all dickmatized!

15:23.241 --> 15:26.275
- Okay, listen to me!
She's not evil.

15:26.379 --> 15:29.172
In fact, she really
cares about my dad.

15:29.275 --> 15:33.241
And I...think
she's a good woman.

15:33.344 --> 15:36.206
- Then why the fuck am I here?

15:38.068 --> 15:39.931
- Kick me?
You gonna kick me?

15:40.034 --> 15:41.689
- Okay, all right, all right.

15:41.793 --> 15:42.827
-Oh yeah?

15:42.931 --> 15:44.655
- You wanna--
- Be that way.

15:44.758 --> 15:47.068
- Silly bitch, huh, huh?

15:47.172 --> 15:48.517
-Get the
fuck away!

15:53.551 --> 15:55.344
- We all have our demons.

15:55.448 --> 15:57.793
-Toeknee, I know
you don't wanna hear this.

15:57.896 --> 15:59.793
And I know you're just
here to protect me.

15:59.896 --> 16:03.620
But I want
my dad to be happy.

16:03.724 --> 16:06.034
And I don't want this anymore.

16:06.137 --> 16:07.655
And I like Brenda.

16:10.862 --> 16:12.000
- What?

16:12.103 --> 16:15.206
- I like Brenda.

16:17.206 --> 16:19.827
I'm sorry, Toeknee.

16:19.931 --> 16:22.068
- I'm proud of you, kid.

16:22.172 --> 16:25.413
You, uh...you really grew up.

16:29.724 --> 16:31.068
- Can you just fade away

16:31.172 --> 16:33.172
like a normal fucking
imaginary friend.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.344
- Ooh.

16:44.310 --> 16:47.068
---like wait,
what happened to Benji?

16:47.172 --> 16:49.206
That was his name.
How original.

16:49.310 --> 16:51.379
His name was Benji!

16:51.482 --> 16:53.068
- But I liked it.

16:53.172 --> 16:55.379
- That's cute.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.413
- You're so funny.

16:56.517 --> 16:57.482
-Oh...

16:59.551 --> 17:01.137
- I love you, Bren.

17:04.758 --> 17:09.724
Uh, just...it's been such a
long time since Tia passed.

17:09.827 --> 17:13.931
And I just haven't met
anyone that I feel so...

17:14.034 --> 17:15.241
strongly about, you know?

17:15.344 --> 17:16.896
I mean, Nora was a
big part of that.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.965
But...it was me too.

17:21.068 --> 17:24.896
Do you, uh, feel a similar way?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.172
- Yeah, I love you.

17:26.275 --> 17:27.310
- Oh, I thought so.

17:29.827 --> 17:32.344
- My stomach.

17:32.448 --> 17:35.172
I gotta--

17:35.275 --> 17:37.862
- --go take a shower.

17:37.965 --> 17:40.137
- Wally?
- What?

17:40.241 --> 17:42.068
- I know you're gonna go poop.

17:42.172 --> 17:43.655
And it's okay.

17:43.758 --> 17:47.448
You can do that around me now.

17:47.551 --> 17:49.275
- I'm really
prairie-dogging here, Bren.

17:49.379 --> 17:50.655
-Oh, no, just go.

17:50.758 --> 17:54.275
Just go, go, go, go, run, run.

17:56.137 --> 17:57.551
- Oh, no.

17:57.655 --> 17:58.793
Come on!

17:59.931 --> 18:02.000
- Looking for this?

18:02.103 --> 18:03.517
- Toeknee--

18:07.413 --> 18:08.862
Are you--are you real?

18:08.965 --> 18:12.344
- Uh, yeah, yeah, I think so.

18:12.448 --> 18:14.413
- Sorry. I, um,
been imagining

18:14.517 --> 18:17.000
some very non-sexy,
non-real things today.

18:17.103 --> 18:18.586
Kind of--

18:18.689 --> 18:19.517
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:19.620 --> 18:22.034
- Makes sense, yeah.
- Yeah.

18:22.137 --> 18:24.137
- These family
things suck, huh?

18:24.241 --> 18:25.551
- Yeah, tell me about it.

18:28.758 --> 18:30.241
- Thanks.

18:33.931 --> 18:35.482
- You--what?

18:35.586 --> 18:37.172
Why are you looking--
why are you looking at me?

18:37.275 --> 18:40.172
- I'm sorry. I just, um...

18:40.275 --> 18:43.448
I've never wanted to kiss
a stranger so badly before.

18:45.827 --> 18:47.482
- Me neither.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.793
- Whoa!

18:52.896 --> 18:55.862
- Just looking for a pony
that escaped from the stable.

18:55.965 --> 18:58.000
You know, what a
slippery shit bag.

18:58.103 --> 19:00.448
I mean, uh, good ol' boy.

19:00.551 --> 19:03.655
Sorry, kids.

19:03.758 --> 19:05.482
- Wow.

19:05.586 --> 19:09.931
- Um, okay, well, that's a
sign that I should probably go.

19:10.034 --> 19:11.241
But it was good meeting you.

19:11.344 --> 19:13.448
And I hope that you're real.

19:13.551 --> 19:14.793
- I am real.

19:14.896 --> 19:17.827
Like J.Lo featuring Ja Rule.

19:17.931 --> 19:20.137
- Okay, they were real
in a different way, but--

19:20.241 --> 19:22.620
- Both real.
- Right. Bye.

19:22.724 --> 19:24.137
- Yeah.

19:31.448 --> 19:33.862
Hey!
I got you pancakes!

19:33.965 --> 19:36.413
- Oh, yeah, wow.

19:36.517 --> 19:38.103
Yeah.

19:39.689 --> 19:42.000
Um...

19:42.103 --> 19:43.758
Brenda, I--I--I...

19:43.862 --> 19:47.137
I wanted to tell you
that you have really...

19:47.241 --> 19:48.206
beautiful teeth.

19:48.310 --> 19:51.241
They look very
naturally beautiful.

19:51.344 --> 19:54.310
And I--you know, my dad's
always been a teeth guy.

19:54.413 --> 19:56.758
- That means the world to me.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.655
You know, I know all
that you've been through.

19:59.758 --> 20:02.655
And seeing the girl
you are today, you know,

20:02.758 --> 20:07.965
if I had a daughter, I'd want
her to turn out just like you.

20:08.068 --> 20:10.103
- That's very nice, but I
feel like if you had a daughter,

20:10.206 --> 20:11.586
you should aim higher.

20:11.689 --> 20:13.896
- No! No.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.862
Oh, there he is!
There he is.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.965
Nora, I want you
to meet someone.

20:19.068 --> 20:21.241
It's my son, Chuck.

20:21.344 --> 20:23.655
- Mom!
- Hi!

20:23.758 --> 20:24.862
- Yeah!

20:24.965 --> 20:26.620
- Wait! Oh, oh, wait.

20:26.724 --> 20:28.689
That's your son, Chuck.

20:28.793 --> 20:29.689
- Yes!

20:29.793 --> 20:31.137
- Half--hapa.

20:31.241 --> 20:33.103
- Yeah, I--I--I have a type.

20:33.206 --> 20:34.724
- Nora. You're Nora.

20:34.827 --> 20:35.689
- Son.

20:35.793 --> 20:36.965
Mother.

20:37.068 --> 20:38.137
Brother.

20:38.241 --> 20:39.896
- What?
- What?

20:40.000 --> 20:41.344
- No.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.172
- I can't wait for you guys
to spend some quality time

20:43.275 --> 20:45.724
together, huh?
That'll be fun, right?

20:45.827 --> 20:47.793
- You know, I'm actually
down for that, yeah.

20:47.896 --> 20:49.172
- Oh, I would love that, yes.

20:49.275 --> 20:50.448
- Great.
-Yeah.

20:50.551 --> 20:52.103
-Get some food!
- Oh, yeah,

20:52.206 --> 20:53.689
I'll get you some brea--
I'll get some pancakes.

20:53.793 --> 20:54.793
Those look good.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.034
So, um,

21:00.137 --> 21:03.413
how long were
you in the country?

21:03.517 --> 21:05.793
- Got some cantaloupe there?

21:05.896 --> 21:08.379
- I'll just use my fingers.
It's, uh--it's a lot of fruit.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.793
- Who the
is Awkwafina?
