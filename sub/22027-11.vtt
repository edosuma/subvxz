00:01.335 --> 00:01.502
.

00:01.535 --> 00:02.636
- Must have been a nice
surprise, seeing Chief Grissom.

00:04.305 --> 00:05.506
- You know, he's the reason
I'm a firefighter.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.041
- I'm looking
at the firefighters

00:07.075 --> 00:08.076
that have come up
under me.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.077
How have they turned out?

00:09.110 --> 00:10.444
- You tell me, Gris.

00:10.478 --> 00:11.679
- I just thought you'd be
further along now.

00:13.081 --> 00:15.149
- You cannot be in love
with Brett.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.651
- I'm not going to do
anything about it, Otis.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.687
I know she doesn't feel
the same way.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.122
- I have a date.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.356
With Zach.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.393
- This fundraiser,
it's for a good cause,

00:25.426 --> 00:27.228
if you care
about firefighters.

00:27.261 --> 00:30.564
- I do care about firefighters.

00:31.565 --> 00:35.369
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:38.406 --> 00:39.207
- Aw, damn.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.474
Where'd I leave it?

00:40.508 --> 00:43.377
- Same place as always,
kitchen counter.

00:43.411 --> 00:46.647
- Hey, uh, thank you
for dragging me out

00:46.680 --> 00:47.781
to that charity thing.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.417
I had a good time.
- Yeah.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.684
Sorry you blew off your date.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.520
- Eh, it's cool.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.588
He understood.

00:56.324 --> 00:58.192
- Dropped off the last
of Bria's things yesterday,

00:58.226 --> 00:59.827
her dad looks
ten years younger.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.263
I mean, recovery's a long road,
but I can tell he's committed.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.731
- Well, he's got plenty
of motivation.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.433
- And now that that's resolved,

01:05.466 --> 01:07.435
Casey and I are trying to find
some time to reconnect.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.537
We've got these spa passes
as a wedding gift.

01:09.570 --> 01:13.241
Finally convinced him
to give it a shot.

01:13.274 --> 01:16.177
- Oh, Shambala Wellness
Sanctuary. Fancy.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.445
- Yeah, you should
get the brochure,

01:17.478 --> 01:18.579
make an appointment
for yourself.

01:18.612 --> 01:19.647
- No, this is overkill.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.315
I don't need all this to relax.

01:21.349 --> 01:23.784
I'm good with a soak in the tub
and some Chinese takeout.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.519
- Hey, either of you see
little Annabelle

01:25.553 --> 01:28.222
wandering around here?
- No.

01:28.256 --> 01:29.457
Eh...

01:29.490 --> 01:32.260
Should I have?

01:33.494 --> 01:36.364
- Hey, Connie, let's set up
a call with Chief Heller

01:36.397 --> 01:39.633
to go over those documents.
- Right away, Chief.

01:42.670 --> 01:43.804
*

01:43.837 --> 01:45.339
Hello, Annabelle.

01:45.373 --> 01:47.908
- How come your desk
is so messy?

01:47.941 --> 01:51.412
- Hey, sorry, Chief, I forgot
about it till this morning,

01:51.445 --> 01:52.746
Take Your Daughter to Work Day.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.648
Cindy thought it'd be
enriching, you know,

01:54.682 --> 01:56.884
for Annabelle to see her dad
on the job.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.519
- Yeah, no problem.

01:58.552 --> 02:01.889
- Come on, now, pumpkin,
we're gonna go get breakfast.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.557
Yeah.

02:03.591 --> 02:08.262
- Your mom didn't say.

02:15.403 --> 02:18.739
- Truck 81, Ambo 61, Squad 3,
traffic collision,

02:18.772 --> 02:21.642
51st and Federal.

02:21.675 --> 02:22.776
- Hmm.

02:28.816 --> 02:35.623
*

02:35.656 --> 02:37.725
- Mouch, Kidd, extinguishers!
- Copy.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.261
- Got it, Captain.
- Herrmann stabilize the truck!

02:40.294 --> 02:42.162
- Copy that!

02:43.597 --> 02:45.299
- Hold on, buddy.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.401
We're gonna get you out.
- Here.

02:47.435 --> 02:48.736
- I got a guy in the rear.

02:48.769 --> 02:49.937
- We'll take care of him.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.240
Let's pop it.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.246
- He's bleeding out,

02:58.279 --> 02:59.680
I'm thinking rapid extrication,
quick and dirty.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.282
- He could have
a cervical fracture.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.483
Might not survive a hard pull.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.352
Let's keep him here,
lift and roll the dash

03:04.385 --> 03:05.786
and steering column off first.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.588
- That'll take too long.
We have to make relief cuts

03:07.621 --> 03:09.790
in the frame first.
- Then let's move.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.360
Come on.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.228
- Capp.
- Yeah.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.530
- Gimme the cutters.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.372
- Let's get this on.

03:35.283 --> 03:36.484
Okay.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.422
- All right, Cruz!
- Yeah!

03:43.324 --> 03:44.825
- Just watch the contact points
for slippage.

03:44.858 --> 03:45.993
- Yeah, I think I got it.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.998
- Hey! Stop it! Stop!

03:51.031 --> 03:52.800
- Casey! Casey!
Come on, man!

03:52.833 --> 03:54.034
- Keep working!

03:54.067 --> 03:56.737
Hey, Otis, grab me
the strong arm.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.807
- Casey, he's gonna
snap his neck!

04:03.010 --> 04:04.412
Hey, knock it off!

04:10.784 --> 04:12.353
You gotta watch his neck!

04:22.363 --> 04:25.032
*

04:25.065 --> 04:27.635
Hey, Severide!

04:27.668 --> 04:28.969
- Hey!

04:32.373 --> 04:35.376
*

04:41.815 --> 04:43.584
- Get off me!

04:43.617 --> 04:46.019
- Don't move!
- Let go!

04:46.053 --> 04:48.422
- We got him.

04:53.427 --> 04:56.464
We're losing him. No more
time for the column lift.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.866
We'll have to do a quick pull
after all. Damn it!

04:58.899 --> 05:01.335
Cut the seatbelt loose,
yank him out!

05:01.369 --> 05:03.937
- You got it!

05:05.473 --> 05:07.908
- We're pulling him out.
Take his legs.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.378
I got his back.
Let's go.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.322
All right, we're clear!
- We got him.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.528
- I got a pulse.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.797
- He's alive!
- Let's go!

05:32.600 --> 05:35.736
- We did what we could.

05:56.590 --> 05:59.593
Uh, for what it's worth,

05:59.627 --> 06:01.895
we made the right call
back there, you know.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.131
When Severide sees these
things, he always--

06:04.164 --> 06:06.600
- Severide did his job.

06:06.634 --> 06:09.136
Let's just focus on the shift.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.972
- Right, sure, you're right.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.986
- Stella!

06:26.019 --> 06:27.488
- Hey.

06:27.521 --> 06:30.558
Aren't you on shift?

06:30.591 --> 06:34.428
They just let you hazmat guys
come and go as you please?

06:34.462 --> 06:35.763
- Detailed to the academy.
- Ah.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.130
- Got a little freedom
to get out,

06:37.164 --> 06:39.767
stretch my legs.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.635
- Hey, I, uh...

06:41.669 --> 06:44.505
I'm sorry about cancelling
that date.

06:44.538 --> 06:47.040
I just--I never get migraines
like that--

06:47.074 --> 06:48.509
- No problem.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.578
You want to try again
tomorrow?

06:50.611 --> 06:53.213
Catch an early movie, make fun
of it over some beers?

06:53.246 --> 06:55.082
- Sure, yeah.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.985
Uh, I can--I can get behind
that.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.453
- All right.

06:59.487 --> 07:01.722
Anyway, I should get back.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.824
- Okay.

07:03.857 --> 07:04.925
- Okay.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.597
- All right.

07:12.833 --> 07:19.807
*

07:21.108 --> 07:24.077
- No, I know, I don't expect
a guarantee, just...

07:24.111 --> 07:26.079
something to consider.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.781
Thanks.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.821
What's the latest?

07:33.854 --> 07:36.056
- The deputy was headed
into surgery when we left.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.858
Touch and go.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.095
- If I ask you a question,

07:42.129 --> 07:44.231
will you give an honest answer,

07:44.264 --> 07:45.966
no pulled punches?

07:45.999 --> 07:48.101
- Always.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.804
- Do you think it could've
made a difference...

07:50.838 --> 07:52.873
going with the quick pull
from the start?

07:56.710 --> 07:57.945
- That's tough to say.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.847
The guy was suffering
from blood loss,

07:59.880 --> 08:00.914
cervical fracture.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.916
I mean, you could go down
a rabbit hole of what ifs,

08:02.950 --> 08:07.988
but my take--any difference
would've been marginal.

08:08.021 --> 08:11.124
*

08:11.158 --> 08:12.526
Listen...

08:13.894 --> 08:17.230
The prisoner caused
that seat bracket to break.

08:17.264 --> 08:20.668
You did your job,
you got him out alive.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.173
- It's an uncomfortable
concept.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.275
- Yeah, it's a little too soon.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.746
- Uh, Otis, she a...

08:32.780 --> 08:34.147
- I know, Mouch, I know.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.083
Hey, hey, Herrmann, uh,
isn't the whole point

08:36.116 --> 08:37.985
of Take Your Daughter
to Work Day to, um,

08:38.018 --> 08:39.753
you know, take your daughter
to work?

08:39.787 --> 08:41.622
Shouldn't you be showing her
around the house?

08:41.655 --> 08:42.923
- Down time
in the common room

08:42.956 --> 08:44.692
is an important part
of the job.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.160
It's not all fire and glory.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.262
Remember that, pumpkin, okay?

08:53.667 --> 08:55.969
- Maybe we could find something
for everyone.

08:56.003 --> 08:58.772
How about the nature channel?
You like giraffes?

09:01.675 --> 09:04.111
Or not.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.013
This'll work.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.149
- Come on, come on.
You're too slow!

09:12.185 --> 09:14.955
- All right, reset, guys,
let's work on that time.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.662
Come on, guys, look alive.
Deputy Chief's here!

09:21.695 --> 09:23.864
- Good to see you're all
keeping sharp.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.934
You boys mind if I borrow your
lieutenant for a minute?

09:26.967 --> 09:28.669
- No problem.
- Hey, Capp, you're in charge.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.604
Run it again.
- Okay.

09:30.638 --> 09:35.042
- I hear you had an interesting
call this morning.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.011
The rumor is that you tackled
a, uh--an escaped prisoner,

09:38.045 --> 09:40.814
is that true?
- Ah, wasn't a big deal.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.082
Guy wasn't getting far.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.017
I just happened to be
in his way.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.186
- That call is actually
the reason I'm here.

09:46.219 --> 09:49.823
I'm getting a lot of questions
from HQ, Sheriff's Office,

09:49.857 --> 09:52.893
hoping you could give me
your perspective.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.828
- I wasn't the incident
commander.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.764
- I want all points of view.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.867
- Okay, van went into a viaduct
head-on.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.702
The driver, the deputy,

10:01.735 --> 10:03.637
he was pinned in
by the steering column.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.673
On the captain's orders,
we brought in a ram to--

10:07.708 --> 10:10.644
- Right, he--
we thought it was--

10:12.245 --> 10:15.015
Who decided to leave the driver
in harm's way?

10:17.117 --> 10:19.720
- We.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.790
It was a fair call.
We operate as a team.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.994
- Uh-huh.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.029
Well, I appreciate you
giving me the time, Kelly.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.764
I'll let you get back
to your drill.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.833
You tell the big guy
to loosen his grip.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.002
He's creating too much drag.

10:35.035 --> 10:39.072
*

10:39.106 --> 10:39.807
Hey, guys.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.409
- Chief.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.111
- Captain, help me out.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.747
All morning, I've got the
Sheriff's office in my ear.

10:46.780 --> 10:50.150
They say the CFD bungled
the rescue of a deputy

10:50.183 --> 10:52.219
while cutting a prisoner loose.
Is that true?

10:52.252 --> 10:54.321
- Just walk us
through the incident.

10:54.354 --> 10:57.290
I understand the steering
column struck him in the chest

10:57.324 --> 10:59.026
as you raised it.
- It did.

10:59.059 --> 11:02.062
The, uh, the prisoner broke
the seat bracket when he was

11:02.095 --> 11:03.864
kicking the panel,
trying to escape.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.198
The column struck the victim,

11:05.232 --> 11:07.100
but he was already in bad shape
when we found him.

11:07.134 --> 11:10.303
Massive blood loss,
neck injury, pinned in.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.272
We considered
a rapid extrication,

11:12.305 --> 11:15.108
but after evaluating
the driver,

11:15.142 --> 11:16.043
I made the determination

11:16.076 --> 11:18.178
that the risk of death
from cervical fracture

11:18.211 --> 11:20.380
was too great to undertake--
- You made the determination.

11:20.413 --> 11:21.882
- I did, yeah.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.151
- Based on
the paramedic's assessment?

11:26.754 --> 11:28.822
- Based on my years
of experience

11:28.856 --> 11:30.157
rescuing accident victims.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.059
- No, I don't doubt that,
but the fact is,

11:32.092 --> 11:33.794
you left him in there
bleeding out,

11:33.827 --> 11:35.262
fractured neck,
with some animal in the back

11:35.295 --> 11:36.296
rocking the boat.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.364
- There were no good options.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.066
Is that true?

11:39.099 --> 11:40.934
What about
your squad lieutenant?

11:40.968 --> 11:42.836
Did he have any options,

11:42.870 --> 11:45.806
or was he in lockstep agreement
the whole time?

11:47.941 --> 11:49.910
- I'm just asking a question.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.049
- All due respect,
my squad lieutenant

11:56.083 --> 11:58.919
wasn't in command of the scene.
- That's still not an answer.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.120
- There's a chain of command

12:00.153 --> 12:02.089
is the only answer
that matters!

12:02.122 --> 12:03.356
- Casey.

12:03.390 --> 12:09.162
*

12:15.268 --> 12:16.837
Yes?

12:19.873 --> 12:21.975
*

12:22.009 --> 12:23.343
Thank you.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.513
That was Chicago Med.

12:26.546 --> 12:30.851
Deputy Keefe...
died 20 minutes ago.

12:34.154 --> 12:39.927
*

12:43.230 --> 12:43.396
.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.197
- Family's holding
a vigil tomorrow.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.335
I'd like to make an appearance.
- Of course.

12:48.368 --> 12:51.171
How'd it go with Grissom?

12:51.204 --> 12:53.140
- Managed to keep myself
on the right side

12:53.173 --> 12:56.109
of an insubordination charge.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.812
Severide.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.556
Deputy didn't make it.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.458
- I heard.
- Found out while I was

13:11.491 --> 13:13.526
getting interrogated
by Chief Grissom.

13:13.560 --> 13:17.831
He suggested the two of you had
a conversation about the call.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.299
- We did.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.868
- Well, in the future,

13:20.901 --> 13:23.303
I'd appreciate keeping our
disagreements between us.

13:23.336 --> 13:26.339
- Okay, well, did he
even mention what I said?

13:26.373 --> 13:28.108
- He said you pushed
for rapid extrication,

13:28.141 --> 13:29.476
and I ignored you.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.578
Got an entire sermon
on command humility.

13:31.611 --> 13:35.115
- Maybe it was one
worth hearing.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.952
I didn't--I didn't sell
you out, Casey!

13:38.986 --> 13:42.189
That's not who I am.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.491
You should know that.

13:44.524 --> 13:50.297
*

13:50.330 --> 13:52.099
- What's your read
on your new captain?

13:52.132 --> 13:53.566
He buckling under pressure?

13:53.600 --> 13:55.502
Could always put someone else
in his post.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.537
- Captain Casey
is a damn fine officer.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.539
Anyone who takes aim at him
has to go through me.

13:59.572 --> 14:03.276
- Understood, your house,
your call.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.412
- What exactly are you getting
at, by the way,

14:05.445 --> 14:06.880
if you don't mind me asking,

14:06.914 --> 14:09.950
baiting my two officers
against each other?

14:09.983 --> 14:12.185
- I remember my first few years
on Squad.

14:12.219 --> 14:15.255
Battalion Chief made it house
policy--every six months,

14:15.288 --> 14:16.589
somebody was out on their ear.

14:16.623 --> 14:19.392
Law of the jungle.
Kept us sharp, hungry,

14:19.426 --> 14:22.329
responsive to command.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.398
I know you got a bond
with these guys,

14:25.432 --> 14:27.134
but we're running
a city service,

14:27.167 --> 14:29.202
not a day care, Wallace.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.606
Here's what I can do.
I'll call HQ,

14:33.640 --> 14:35.275
work a little magic.

14:35.308 --> 14:38.545
Have them spin it so there's
no blowback to the captain.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.647
That'd be a favor.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.249
Me to you.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.250
- And I'll remember that.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.385
- Anything comes up on this,

14:45.418 --> 14:46.653
you'll be the first to hear.

14:46.686 --> 14:48.688
I'd appreciate the same.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.924
- Without question.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.293
- Good to see you again, Chief.
- Yep.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.362
- I'll keep in touch.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.170
*

15:04.404 --> 15:06.139
- I'll be pulling some
overtime,

15:06.173 --> 15:07.540
so I need you
to go shopping.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.442
Station got hit
with a triple homicide,

15:09.476 --> 15:12.012
cartel-related,
real bloodbath.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.213
Where's your pen?

15:13.246 --> 15:16.016
- I will have one shortly.
- Mm-hmm.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.585
- Hey, Trudy...

15:23.223 --> 15:25.525
Christopher, use your words.

15:25.558 --> 15:28.461
- Would you mind maybe ixnaying
on the homidenay

15:28.495 --> 15:30.597
around the kidnay?

15:30.630 --> 15:33.033
- Oh, hey, squirt.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.038
Hand me the remote.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.475
- I'm a police sergeant.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.678
- Sure.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.514
I got some stories.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.086
- Hey.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.088
- So, it's looking
like Casey and I

15:55.122 --> 15:56.456
can't go to the spa after all.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.391
He wants to pay his respects
at the deputy's vigil,

15:58.425 --> 15:59.692
and I don't blame him.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.561
- No, of course.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.430
- Here's the good news.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.366
- Yeah, the passes expire
at the end of the month,

16:06.399 --> 16:07.767
and it'd be a shame to let it
go to waste.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.303
I know it doesn't include
Chinese takeout, but--

16:10.337 --> 16:11.471
- No.
I don't know what to say.

16:11.504 --> 16:12.472
- You don't have
to say anything.

16:12.505 --> 16:15.208
Early birthday gift.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.744
- Wh--hey,
these are for two.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.212
- Yeah, invite someone.

16:19.246 --> 16:22.015
- Right.

16:22.049 --> 16:25.385
Hey, Stella, any interest
in a spa day with me tomorrow?

16:25.418 --> 16:27.754
- I would, but I got a date.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.789
Sorry.
- Mm.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.625
- Ah, ask your roomie!

16:33.760 --> 16:37.264
- Um, nothing, it's just Dawson
gave me these passes

16:37.297 --> 16:40.100
for a spa treatment tomorrow,
so...

16:41.234 --> 16:43.103
- Um, yeah, I'm sure it's--

16:43.136 --> 16:46.706
- Shoulder's been stiff from
doing R&D on the Slamigan.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.308
Massage sounds good.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.776
Tomorrow, you said?

16:49.809 --> 16:52.479
- Um...

16:52.512 --> 16:54.114
- Uh, yeah, for sure.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.315
- Sweet.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.693
- Heard you and Casey
got into a tiff,

17:06.726 --> 17:09.629
and, uh, the thought of you
sitting up here

17:09.662 --> 17:12.099
brooding all alone
was too sad to ignore.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.334
- No one's brooding.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.139
- Nah, I--I got gum.

17:22.309 --> 17:25.145
So, uh, are you two--

17:25.178 --> 17:27.614
- Don't.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.153
- I've never been up here.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.187
It's nice.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.188
- It is.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.525
- Whoa--stop the car!

17:38.558 --> 17:40.660
- That doesn't sound good.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.362
- Hello!

17:42.395 --> 17:43.730
Hel-lo!

17:43.763 --> 17:45.598
Hey, where is everyone,
huh?

17:45.632 --> 17:48.768
Where are all the firemen?

17:50.370 --> 17:52.505
- Hey.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.341
What's the trouble?

17:56.243 --> 17:58.345
My buddy's dead, man.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.479
That's the trouble.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.515
What are you doing?
Kicking back?

18:02.549 --> 18:04.151
Smoking a damn cigar?

18:04.184 --> 18:06.753
- You want to help
your friend, here?

18:06.786 --> 18:08.621
- I don't need help!

18:08.655 --> 18:10.790
- Come on, man, cool it.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.860
Are you the Chief?

18:13.893 --> 18:14.894
- Yes, I am.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.230
You should listen
to your friend.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.531
Get in the car and leave

18:18.565 --> 18:21.701
before you say something
you're gonna regret.

18:23.270 --> 18:26.373
- Keefe was counting on you.

18:26.406 --> 18:29.142
You let him down, man,
you let him down!

18:31.811 --> 18:34.681
And the next time you all find
yourself in a jam

18:34.714 --> 18:36.883
and you want to call
on us for help,

18:36.916 --> 18:40.187
I want you all
to keep that in mind!

18:40.853 --> 18:42.922
- Sam, come on.

18:42.955 --> 18:43.923
Let's go.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.925
- I'm going, bro.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.260
I'm going.

18:50.497 --> 18:57.637
*

19:07.914 --> 19:08.248
.

19:08.281 --> 19:09.048
- I know a few
of these county guys.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.518
They're just blowing off steam.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.186
If you want, I can put
in a good word,

19:13.220 --> 19:14.487
see if it doesn't
smooth things over.

19:14.521 --> 19:15.755
- Anything you think
might help.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.824
- Happy to.
- Appreciate it.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.826
- Look...

19:19.859 --> 19:22.762
You had a split-second
decision to make.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.631
Lives on the line.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.434
Most of these guys have been
there at some point or another.

19:27.467 --> 19:31.671
Just give 'em time,
they'll understand.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.640
- Thanks, Trudy.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.974
- Sure.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.210
- I'll walk you out.

19:41.648 --> 19:45.585
- Still think it's a good idea
to go to that vigil?

19:45.618 --> 19:47.654
- I want to pay my respects.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.857
If there's trouble,
we'll leave.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.929
- You sure she was being
genuine with her invitation?

19:56.963 --> 19:58.731
- I figured she was.
- Mm-hmm.

19:58.765 --> 19:59.899
Well, what'd you say?

20:01.301 --> 20:03.503
Dude, Joe.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.806
Look, getting a massage
sounds a lot better

20:06.839 --> 20:08.341
than hanging in the apartment
all day.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.810
- Don't you think it's
a little intimate?

20:10.843 --> 20:14.681
- It's not like we're massaging
each other.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.285
Just know that the success
of the Bruzotis experiment

20:18.318 --> 20:20.853
has always depended on a
carefully balanced alchemy--

20:20.887 --> 20:22.789
- Mm-hmm.
- Well-timed game nights--

20:22.822 --> 20:24.491
- Mm-hmm.
- And respect

20:24.524 --> 20:26.826
for personal space.

20:26.859 --> 20:31.331
So if you ruin this,
I will not be happy.

20:34.501 --> 20:36.769
- What exactly was Cindy
mad about?

20:36.803 --> 20:39.472
- Well, she says that I didn't
give Annabelle, you know,

20:39.506 --> 20:42.008
quote unquote "the
real firehouse experience,"

20:42.041 --> 20:43.843
whatever that is.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.011
- Did you take her
on the truck?

20:45.044 --> 20:46.646
Heck no!

20:46.679 --> 20:48.848
That hunk of bolts
with the busted safety belts,

20:48.881 --> 20:50.317
are you out of your mind?

20:50.350 --> 20:52.285
- Yeah, how about
a ladder demonstration?

20:52.319 --> 20:54.321
- Did you show her how
the engine pump works?

20:54.354 --> 20:56.856
- Mouch, do you know how
an engine pump works?

20:56.889 --> 20:58.291
- Yeah, I'm with Cindy
on this one.

20:58.325 --> 21:01.594
There was a lot of TV going on
yesterday.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.764
You know,
maybe I could've done more,

21:04.797 --> 21:05.932
but, I mean,

21:05.965 --> 21:07.767
is it so bad if my little girl

21:07.800 --> 21:10.737
decides that she doesn't want
to do some dangerous job

21:10.770 --> 21:12.004
that her dad does?

21:12.038 --> 21:14.574
I mean, she's a smart kid.

21:14.607 --> 21:18.478
- Okay, all I'm saying
is that your little girl

21:18.511 --> 21:19.946
is her own person.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.915
And one day, she might throw
you a curveball.

21:22.949 --> 21:26.486
- She's eight! I got a few
years before she comes home

21:26.519 --> 21:28.821
with a nose ring.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.557
Right?

21:41.768 --> 21:43.536
- We don't have to stay long,

21:43.570 --> 21:46.706
stick around for a minute,
make a donation, head out.

21:46.739 --> 21:49.409
- I'll follow your lead.

21:54.681 --> 21:55.982
- Excuse me.

21:56.015 --> 21:58.418
You folks family, friends,
or with the department?

21:58.451 --> 22:02.522
You both look familiar,
I just can't remember where.

22:02.555 --> 22:05.758
- I'm Matt Casey, and this
is my wife, Gabriela Dawson.

22:05.792 --> 22:08.761
We, uh--met last night.

22:10.897 --> 22:13.533
- That's what I thought.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.602
You a fireman.
- I am.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.837
- Paramedic.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.105
Same house though.

22:19.138 --> 22:22.041
- We just wanted to come,
pay our respects.

22:22.074 --> 22:27.947
*

22:27.980 --> 22:30.049
- Keefe was a good guy.

22:30.082 --> 22:33.620
You know, one of the really
rare ones.

22:33.653 --> 22:34.721
- I can imagine.

22:34.754 --> 22:36.623
- No, man, you can't.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.527
Keefe was the kind of guy

22:40.560 --> 22:42.929
that made everyone
around him better.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.964
He made me better.

22:44.997 --> 22:49.702
*

22:49.736 --> 22:51.738
And now...what?

22:54.874 --> 22:57.109
Leaves behind a wife.

22:57.143 --> 22:59.979
There's no kids,
a bunch of empty plans.

23:00.012 --> 23:03.583
How do you make sense of that?

23:05.752 --> 23:07.654
- I don't know.

23:07.687 --> 23:11.691
*

23:14.160 --> 23:16.596
- No, no.
- No, we're good, thanks.

23:16.629 --> 23:21.000
- Come on. I'll introduce you
to some of the guys.

23:21.033 --> 23:28.441
*

23:34.681 --> 23:37.617
- Good afternoon,
are you ready for bliss?

23:37.650 --> 23:40.653
- Uh...well, I'm about
90% ready for bliss.

23:40.687 --> 23:44.023
I'm--I'm still waiting on my
spa partner, he's running late.

23:44.056 --> 23:45.758
- Not a problem.
- And--

23:45.792 --> 23:47.560
And just--just to be clear,

23:47.594 --> 23:50.997
when I say partner, I don't
mean it in a romantic sense.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.565
- Sure.
- We're friends.

23:52.599 --> 23:55.602
Um, could I ask your advice?

23:55.635 --> 23:58.638
How do I make sure that
I don't send the wrong message

23:58.671 --> 23:59.539
in this scenario?

23:59.572 --> 24:01.641
I mean, he's a very sweet guy
with a smile

24:01.674 --> 24:03.175
that you never want
to see go away,

24:03.209 --> 24:05.645
and it's not as if there aren't
feelings there anymore,

24:05.678 --> 24:07.113
it's just I don't want
to lead him on.

24:07.146 --> 24:09.916
- Sorry, sorry, came as fast
as I could.

24:13.152 --> 24:14.621
- Oh, no, no, ha, it's--

24:14.654 --> 24:16.523
- Oh, yeah, Cruz
had a family thing,

24:16.556 --> 24:17.790
didn't really catch
the details.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.659
Do we get to keep these robes
at the end?

24:19.692 --> 24:21.227
Or is there some sort
of charge for that?

24:21.260 --> 24:24.964
- I'll go get your masseuses.

24:24.997 --> 24:29.569
*

24:31.070 --> 24:34.841
- Mmm, good call
on the thin crust.

24:34.874 --> 24:37.243
I could eat, like, three more.

24:37.276 --> 24:39.211
- I won't judge.
- Okay, good.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.180
The guy that I--that
I stay with,

24:41.213 --> 24:43.650
he always keeps us stocked
in the fridge.

24:43.683 --> 24:46.218
- This is the, um, Squad guy,
right?

24:49.021 --> 24:50.222
- Yep.

24:50.256 --> 24:51.924
- How long you guys been
living together?

24:51.958 --> 24:53.993
- Not long.

24:54.026 --> 24:56.896
It just--I--I lost
my apartment

24:56.929 --> 24:59.165
and he let me crash.

24:59.198 --> 25:00.933
That's all.

25:00.967 --> 25:04.604
*

25:04.637 --> 25:06.973
Can we talk about
something else?

25:07.006 --> 25:09.108
- Yes, we can.
- Okay.

25:09.141 --> 25:10.710
- Um, oh!

25:10.743 --> 25:13.179
Guy in my company says
he has this plan.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.847
He wants to pull a prank
on some old friends

25:14.881 --> 25:15.982
from his academy class--

25:16.015 --> 25:18.084
- It's also...

25:18.117 --> 25:20.186
it's not a permanent thing,

25:20.219 --> 25:22.855
this whole living situation
with Severide.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.958
And I just wanted
to put that out there

25:25.992 --> 25:27.860
just in case you were worried.

25:27.894 --> 25:29.762
- I wasn't.

25:30.597 --> 25:32.699
- Okay.
- So anyway, Bryce--

25:32.732 --> 25:34.133
he's the guy.
- Mm.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.335
- Hey.
- Hey, Chief.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.870
What are you having?

25:37.904 --> 25:40.306
- Scotch neat, plus another
of whatever

25:40.339 --> 25:41.841
Kelly's having over here.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.175
- I'm straight, thanks.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.011
- I hear congratulations
are in order.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.980
Word at headquarters is you're
getting a commendation

25:48.014 --> 25:50.182
for tackling that prisoner.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.753
- First
I've heard of it.

25:53.786 --> 25:56.122
- Hey, hold your head up.
This is good news.

25:56.155 --> 25:58.991
*

25:59.025 --> 26:01.694
- Did you put in
for the award?

26:01.728 --> 26:03.896
- All that matters
is how you use this

26:03.930 --> 26:05.598
to your maximum advantage.

26:05.632 --> 26:07.033
The wind isn't always
at your back, Kelly,

26:07.066 --> 26:09.001
so you have to take these
moments when they come.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.302
- A sheriff's deputy
just died.

26:10.336 --> 26:11.704
My friend's
catching heat for it.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.305
- So go light a candle.

26:13.339 --> 26:15.207
Come on, Kelly.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.176
You're smart. This is
how you leapfrog.

26:19.812 --> 26:21.948
Look, you can keep going
out there, swinging an axe

26:21.981 --> 26:24.951
until a bad call
gets you laid up forever.

26:24.984 --> 26:26.719
Or you could do the work

26:26.753 --> 26:28.788
and earn yourself
a permanent spot at the table.

26:28.821 --> 26:31.023
Now, your father would agree--
- To hell with my father.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.792
And to hell with this.

26:32.825 --> 26:35.762
I got into this job to save
lives, not to play leapfrog.

26:35.795 --> 26:39.165
Find someone else for whatever
you're trying to do here.

26:39.198 --> 26:40.900
I'm not your guy.

26:40.933 --> 26:44.704
*

26:56.248 --> 26:56.615
.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.754
You want to call for backup?

27:01.788 --> 27:04.290
All right, your collar.

27:04.323 --> 27:05.858
Let's do this.

27:08.895 --> 27:10.196
*

27:10.229 --> 27:11.931
Christopher Herrmann?

27:13.199 --> 27:13.966
- Hey there!

27:14.000 --> 27:16.102
Annabelle,
what are you doing here?

27:16.135 --> 27:19.038
- Mommy signed me up to be
a Junior Police Explorer.

27:20.907 --> 27:22.174
- You want to do me a favor

27:22.208 --> 27:25.244
and put your hands
where we can see them?

27:25.277 --> 27:26.445
What's going on?

27:26.478 --> 27:28.815
*

27:28.848 --> 27:30.049
- That's a written
warning.

27:30.082 --> 27:31.417
Truancy violation.

27:31.450 --> 27:34.086
Apparently, you failed
to properly notify

27:34.120 --> 27:35.988
your daughter's school
prior to her

27:36.022 --> 27:38.891
Take Your Daughter to Work Day
absence on Wednesday.

27:40.159 --> 27:42.361
- Next time,
it'll be a $300 fine.

27:42.394 --> 27:43.896
You--

27:43.930 --> 27:46.833
*

27:46.866 --> 27:49.068
Okay, fine, sorry, Sergeant.

27:51.971 --> 27:53.940
- Bye, Daddy.

27:53.973 --> 27:56.242
*

27:56.275 --> 27:57.877
- All right.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.712
Stay safe, have fun.

27:59.746 --> 28:01.413
- Let's vamanos.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.750
Donuts are on me, dude.

28:03.783 --> 28:04.751
- Okay.

28:04.784 --> 28:07.019
*

28:07.053 --> 28:09.756
- Who would've guessed Herrmann
has a cop in the family?

28:09.789 --> 28:12.925
- Hey, don't even think it.

28:16.095 --> 28:19.732
- Shoot! Thank you.

28:19.766 --> 28:21.400
- Yeah, no worries.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.937
- Hey, Kelly, um...

28:24.971 --> 28:27.974
you know I appreciate you
letting me crash

28:28.007 --> 28:29.375
these past few weeks,

28:29.408 --> 28:32.411
but I think it's time.

28:32.444 --> 28:36.382
Um, I'm gonna start
that apartment search again.

28:37.984 --> 28:39.085
- No rush.

28:39.118 --> 28:42.221
- Lieutenant, Chief wants you.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.165
- Chief.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.903
- I got a call
from headquarters.

28:56.936 --> 28:59.205
Looks like you're getting
a commendation for your efforts

28:59.238 --> 29:00.472
on that call the other day.

29:00.506 --> 29:02.274
- Right, I, uh...

29:02.308 --> 29:04.043
I heard something like that
was in the works.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.878
- Well, I just want to give you
the good news,

29:05.912 --> 29:07.146
start the shift off.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.882
- Appreciate it.
The thing is...

29:09.916 --> 29:11.417
I'd rather pass.

29:12.819 --> 29:15.421
- On the commendation,
respectfully.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.227
I just prefer to do my job

29:21.260 --> 29:22.829
without a ton of fanfare
about it.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.931
- I don't think anybody could
ever accuse you

29:24.964 --> 29:26.532
of being in it
for the glory, Kelly.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.567
What's this about?

29:28.600 --> 29:31.904
Is it Grissom?

29:31.938 --> 29:33.539
- He thinks of me like a son.

29:33.572 --> 29:35.341
Has his own plans
for my future.

29:35.374 --> 29:37.343
I'm pretty sure he cooked up
this commendation

29:37.376 --> 29:39.278
to try to motivate me
up the chain of command.

29:39.311 --> 29:40.880
And I don't want it!
- Kelly,

29:40.913 --> 29:42.915
I understand not wanting
to be defined

29:42.949 --> 29:44.851
by somebody else's ambition.

29:44.884 --> 29:47.319
But you gotta learn to take
credit when credit's due.

29:49.221 --> 29:52.091
- Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambo 61,

29:52.124 --> 29:54.160
Hazmat Unit.

29:54.193 --> 29:56.963
Industrial accident,
Lakeshore Drive.

30:03.002 --> 30:09.141
*

30:13.312 --> 30:16.215
- We need an EMS plan one
and a still and box alarm.

30:16.248 --> 30:19.318
- Let's get everyone cleared
back as far as possible.

30:19.351 --> 30:20.252
Dawson.

30:20.286 --> 30:22.488
Get triage started.
- Already on it.

30:22.521 --> 30:25.091
- Severide, as soon as Hazmat
gives their assessment,

30:25.124 --> 30:26.258
I want you leading the charge.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.861
- Yeah, you got it, Captain.

30:28.895 --> 30:30.229
- Come on, let's get you
out of here.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.198
- There's still
a ton of people inside.

30:32.231 --> 30:34.200
There was an explosion
in the welding area.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.002
Pipes are bursting all over.

30:36.035 --> 30:39.271
I smelled smoke...
I think it was chlorine.

30:39.305 --> 30:42.241
- Engine 51, get a fog line
covering the main door.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.110
We still have victims inside.

30:44.143 --> 30:46.212
- Chief, we're in a highly
combustible situation

30:46.245 --> 30:48.247
that's gonna get worse
as long as that gas is flowing.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.415
We need to get in there,

30:49.448 --> 30:50.983
see if we can stem
the chlorine leak

30:51.017 --> 30:51.984
before it combines
with more acetylene

30:52.018 --> 30:53.319
and we get another explosion.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.387
- Understood. I want you
working with Squad.

30:55.421 --> 30:57.256
You go in, you locate
the source.

30:57.289 --> 30:59.558
Truck 81, you handle
search and rescue.

30:59.591 --> 31:00.893
- Copy that, Chief.

31:00.927 --> 31:02.328
Mouch, Otis, Herrmann,
with me.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.997
Kidd, stay behind
in case we need anything.

31:05.031 --> 31:06.332
- Yes, sir!
- Go. Let's go!

31:06.365 --> 31:08.000
- I'm thinking following
that smoke should lead us

31:08.034 --> 31:10.402
towards the leak.

31:10.436 --> 31:15.507
*

31:15.541 --> 31:16.675
This way!

31:19.045 --> 31:20.913
- This place is a maze!

31:23.582 --> 31:25.017
- Casey!

31:25.051 --> 31:26.618
- Grab whoever you can!
- Copy that.

31:26.652 --> 31:30.422
- Chief, we got several victims
down at our location, over.

31:32.158 --> 31:34.326
- Metal and concrete's
interfering with reception!

31:34.360 --> 31:36.695
- Over here!
We need some help!

31:36.728 --> 31:40.699
- Hey, buddy, don't worry.
We'll get you outta here.

31:44.536 --> 31:46.705
- Right here! Right here!
She's right here.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.978
- Ma'am.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.479
Ma'am, can you hear me?

31:59.385 --> 32:01.187
Kidd, can you hear me?

32:01.220 --> 32:02.454
- Barely.

32:02.488 --> 32:04.623
- We need the cutters
down here, quick!

32:04.656 --> 32:06.325
- Copy! I'm on my way!

32:06.358 --> 32:09.295
- Chief!
Chlorine and acetylene levels

32:09.328 --> 32:11.063
are both rising again.

32:11.097 --> 32:12.431
If those two gases
find each other,

32:12.464 --> 32:14.366
the blast'll be twice the size
as the last one.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.468
- Hard to say--five,

32:16.502 --> 32:19.371
ten minutes if the release
rate holds steady.

32:21.407 --> 32:23.275
- All units, let's wrap it up
in there.

32:23.309 --> 32:25.311
Let's start working
towards an exit.

32:25.344 --> 32:26.678
Severide, we are running
out of time

32:26.712 --> 32:28.680
for you to shut down
those leaks.

32:28.714 --> 32:30.216
- Yeah, copy that, Chief!

32:34.186 --> 32:35.621
Over here!

32:35.654 --> 32:37.589
*

32:38.724 --> 32:41.493
- All right, we need to find
the main shutoff valve

32:41.527 --> 32:43.729
for the acetylene and the
chlorine. Where're they at?

32:43.762 --> 32:45.297
- Acetylene valves
are right up there.

32:45.331 --> 32:47.099
Chlorine tank is up
on the roof!

32:47.133 --> 32:48.567
- All right, Capp, Cruz,
get these guys out!

32:48.600 --> 32:51.237
- Yeah, you got it!
Hey buddy, let's go, come on!

32:51.270 --> 32:52.638
I got you!
- Hey, Chief,

32:52.671 --> 32:55.441
we found the location of the
acetylene shutoff valve.

32:55.474 --> 32:56.742
- Copy!

33:00.412 --> 33:03.382
- Right there!
This should be it!

33:03.415 --> 33:05.284
- Right!

33:05.317 --> 33:07.653
*

33:07.686 --> 33:09.155
Damn thing's stiff!

33:09.188 --> 33:11.190
Probably hasn't been moved
in years.

33:11.223 --> 33:12.791
- Hey, be careful, man!

33:12.824 --> 33:14.160
- Ah--

33:14.193 --> 33:15.694
- Zach!

33:20.599 --> 33:20.766
.

33:27.373 --> 33:29.275
- Zach!

33:29.308 --> 33:30.476
*

33:30.509 --> 33:32.511
Hey!

33:32.544 --> 33:34.446
Hey, Zach, talk to me, man!

33:42.354 --> 33:44.356
- Just breathe, man!

33:45.824 --> 33:48.560
- Mayday! This is Squad 3.
I got a man down!

33:48.594 --> 33:50.096
Chief, the valve's
compromised.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.363
I can't shut the gas
off from here.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.565
- Casey!

33:53.599 --> 33:55.201
*

33:55.234 --> 33:56.202
Casey!

33:56.235 --> 33:58.304
- Kidd, Kidd, up here!

33:58.337 --> 34:03.109
*

34:03.142 --> 34:05.111
- Help me hold her in place.

34:05.144 --> 34:07.379
- Yeah.
- Mayday, this is Squad 3.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.181
I got a man down.

34:09.215 --> 34:12.351
I repeat, mayday!

34:12.384 --> 34:14.386
- Kidd!

34:14.420 --> 34:16.188
Hold her still
while I cut the brace.

34:16.222 --> 34:18.157
- Yeah!

34:22.228 --> 34:23.262
- Chief!

34:23.295 --> 34:25.464
With the valve blown,
our release rate just spiked.

34:25.497 --> 34:26.865
We got maybe three minutes.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.300
May not have enough time
to evacuate

34:28.334 --> 34:30.536
everyone we've got in there.
- Got it.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.272
All units, pull out.
Pull out now!

34:33.305 --> 34:36.842
You have...immediately...copy!

34:36.875 --> 34:38.844
- Just keep breathing, man.

34:38.877 --> 34:41.813
- Hey, Chief, I haven't seen
any sign of Casey.

34:41.847 --> 34:43.549
He should've been out by now.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.784
- Casey, report.

34:45.817 --> 34:47.286
- It's like a crypt in there,

34:47.319 --> 34:49.155
you can hardly get
a signal in or out.

34:49.188 --> 34:53.159
- Casey, you have to evacuate
immediately, do you copy?

34:53.192 --> 34:55.861
- Kidd, how's your sense
of direction?

34:55.894 --> 34:58.297
- I can't tell
if we're coming or going.

35:00.732 --> 35:03.335
- Dead end.
Damn it.

35:03.369 --> 35:05.103
- Captain.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.340
- This way. Come on.

35:08.374 --> 35:11.743
Casey, report. C...report.

35:11.777 --> 35:14.880
*

35:14.913 --> 35:17.816
- Severide!
- Cruz!

35:17.849 --> 35:20.419
Here, take him!

35:27.726 --> 35:28.894
Hey, Cruz.

35:28.927 --> 35:31.330
How many people
are down there?

35:31.363 --> 35:32.498
- A ton!

35:32.531 --> 35:35.567
*

35:35.601 --> 35:37.203
Wait--
Where are you going?

35:37.236 --> 35:39.605
- There's a shutoff valve for
the chlorine on the roof

35:39.638 --> 35:40.772
if I can get to it!

35:40.806 --> 35:42.441
- No way, Lieutenant,
the Chief said--

35:42.474 --> 35:44.410
- Hey--go!
- Lieutenant!

35:44.443 --> 35:47.713
- That's an order!

35:48.814 --> 35:50.249
- We're on the right track,
almost there.

35:50.282 --> 35:51.850
- I see it!
- Chief, I'm headed for

35:51.883 --> 35:53.352
the shutoff
valve on the roof.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.254
See if I can
buy us some time.

35:55.287 --> 35:58.724
- Wait, wait, wait,
stop, stop, stop, stop!

36:04.863 --> 36:07.333
- Chief, I'm gonna help
Severide.

36:07.366 --> 36:09.335
- Damn!

36:09.368 --> 36:10.669
- Okay.

36:10.702 --> 36:13.239
Got her?
- Yes!

36:38.497 --> 36:39.531
Come on!

36:41.767 --> 36:43.635
Help!
- We gotcha.

36:43.669 --> 36:44.636
- I got her.

36:58.284 --> 37:00.519
What happened?

37:00.552 --> 37:03.622
- Took in a heavy dose of smoke
and gas, but he's breathing.

37:06.992 --> 37:09.995
- He went to get Severide.

37:19.971 --> 37:22.574
- Severide!
- I almost got it!

37:22.608 --> 37:24.510
- We gotta go!
- I'm not leaving

37:24.543 --> 37:27.279
till I get this shut!

37:33.552 --> 37:35.321
Damn it!

37:39.925 --> 37:42.461
- Chief, I found Severide!

37:42.494 --> 37:44.330
We slowed the gas
to buy some time,

37:44.363 --> 37:45.597
but the valve won't stay
closed.

37:45.631 --> 37:47.299
We need to hold it manually.

37:47.333 --> 37:48.700
Should be able to keep it
at bay long enough

37:48.734 --> 37:49.968
to get everyone out.

37:50.001 --> 37:51.537
- Don't press your luck.

37:51.570 --> 37:54.473
You see anything off,
you bail, understood?

37:54.506 --> 37:55.807
- Copy, Chief.

37:55.841 --> 37:57.008
If we live through this,

37:57.042 --> 37:58.009
I can't tell if you'll get
a reprimand

37:58.043 --> 37:59.578
or another commendation.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.447
- I turned it down.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.948
- It was just something
that Grissom was pushing.

38:02.981 --> 38:04.983
Tried to use it as a way
to toss me up the ladder.

38:05.016 --> 38:06.718
- I suggested the commendation.

38:06.752 --> 38:09.588
- Yeah!

38:09.621 --> 38:10.889
- Casey, Severide,
we're all clear.

38:10.922 --> 38:11.890
Get out of there, now!

38:11.923 --> 38:14.059
- Copy, Chief.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.364
- Come on.

38:18.397 --> 38:20.632
Soon as we leave this thing,

38:20.666 --> 38:21.767
it's gonna blow.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.702
*

38:23.735 --> 38:24.703
- How many steps
do you think it is

38:24.736 --> 38:28.440
to the edge of the building?

38:28.474 --> 38:30.676
Jump?

38:30.709 --> 38:31.777
- Sure.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.879
We let go, make a break for it,

38:33.912 --> 38:36.081
jump into the water.

38:36.948 --> 38:39.785
Come on, get ready.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.853
Count of three.
- This is insane.

38:41.887 --> 38:43.655
- Let's go! One...

38:43.689 --> 38:44.723
Two...
- Damn it, Casey.

38:44.756 --> 38:46.392
- Three!
