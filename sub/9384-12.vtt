to take some Hunter Green.

00:10.677 --> 00:14.014
And we'll put a happy little bush
right down over here in the corner.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.642
And that'll just be our little secret.

00:17.184 --> 00:20.354
And if you tell anyone
that that bush is there...

00:20.812 --> 00:23.398
...I will come to your house
and I will cut you!

Thank you. Thank you.

It was 360 years ago
that Quahog founder...

01:58.577 --> 02:01.371
...Miles "Chatterbox" Musket set sail...

02:01.455 --> 02:03.665
...for the new colony of Rhode Island.

when we get to shore? First...

...I'm gonna have me a snack.
No! Shower!

WEST: Ever the free thinker...

02:15.469 --> 02:18.388
...Miles was thrown overboard
for speaking his mind.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.935
He was as good as dead.
But as legend has it...

02:23.018 --> 02:26.647
...he was saved by a magic clam
who brought him to shore...

02:26.730 --> 02:29.316
...and shared the vision
of a new colony...

02:29.483 --> 02:32.236
...which would be called Quahog.

02:32.819 --> 02:37.199

for timber and the bounty of the sea.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.909
MILES: Look at all this sand!

02:38.992 --> 02:42.246
Did you know there are beaches
with black sand? Did I pack my towel?

CLAM: Are you listening?
I'm trying to help you.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.668
ADAM WEST: And help he did.
Thanks to the clam's leadership...

02:47.751 --> 02:50.921
...Quahog became a great
and prosperous settlement.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.716
But relations between Miles
and the clam soon soured.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.719
MILES: I know he's an Indian.
But what kind of name is Squanto?

02:57.803 --> 03:00.222
"Leslie" or something like that
would be nice.

...from a combination of tuberculosis
and a tomahawk to the head...

03:58.113 --> 04:00.282
...he went to the shore on this day...

04:00.365 --> 04:03.785
...in hopes that the magic clam
would return.

04:03.869 --> 04:07.497

continue this tradition.

CHRIS: Okay, time out.

11:02.996 --> 11:06.708
CHRIS: This kind of acrimony isn't
gonna resolve our differences.

11:06.792 --> 11:09.294
Just shut up and throw a chair.

11:09.670 --> 11:10.754
Okay!

11:26.103 --> 11:27.187
Great show out there.

11:27.271 --> 11:28.981
If you want an autograph now...

11:29.064 --> 11:31.817
...you either gotta give me a pen
or get me some snow.

11:31.900 --> 11:35.153
I look at you and see a series.
We want to put cameras...

11:35.237 --> 11:38.073
...in your house and follow the drama
that is your family.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.616
Kind of like The Real World.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.661
All right! Then everyone would
see me and my wacky antics.

12:14.693 --> 12:17.112
Mom, are we on TV right now?

12:17.196 --> 12:19.907
Yes, Chris.
Your father signed a contract.

12:19.990 --> 12:23.160
And now we're gonna be on TV
for the next six months.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.578
How could you do this?

12:24.661 --> 12:27.247
You've turned my life into
the 24-Hour Loser Channel!

12:27.331 --> 12:28.624
STEWIE: You, cameraman!

12:28.707 --> 12:30.959
Make sure you use that
Cybill Shepherd filter!

12:31.043 --> 12:34.296
If it makes her look human,
it should take six months off my face.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.218
I find the toothpaste with the pump...

12:39.301 --> 12:42.095
...is a little easier to get on the brush.

12:43.222 --> 12:46.016
You might've noticed
my underwear has a hole in it.

12:46.642 --> 12:49.937
You know,
I don't see any reason to throw it out.

12:50.145 --> 12:51.980
The waist is still fine.

12:52.064 --> 12:54.858

your father's just a free spirit.

13:05.619 --> 13:06.620

A good breakfast is the foundation
of a good day.

is the foundation of indigestion.

a bloody heart attack?

13:24.096 --> 13:25.597
Make it again!

13:25.973 --> 13:28.600
The breakfast thing. Yes.

13:28.684 --> 13:32.688
It wasn't even about the eggs, really.
Frankly, I like the yolks.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.858
I have no problem....

13:36.066 --> 13:38.944
There's always been a lot of tension
between Lois and me.

13:39.027 --> 13:42.406
And it's not so much
that I want to "kill" her.

13:43.031 --> 13:46.743
It's just I want her
not to be alive anymore.

13:48.036 --> 13:51.123
I sometimes wonder
if all women are this difficult.

13:51.373 --> 13:53.709
And then I think to myself, "My God...

13:54.126 --> 13:57.713
"...wouldn't it be marvelous
if I turned out to be a homosexual?"

14:03.260 --> 14:06.889
One time my dad pooped in the
neighbor's yard and then lied about it.

I knew it!

On Sundays we generally
catch the early-bird special...

14:29.536 --> 14:31.496

14:32.331 --> 14:34.750
Fresh seafood, good prices.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.669
Plus it's a shanty.

14:38.003 --> 14:40.172
And you get to pick your own lobster.

14:40.255 --> 14:42.758
Yes. That one looks like
he's got some fight in him.

14:42.841 --> 14:45.552

14:45.802 --> 14:47.346
My God! It is them!

14:47.429 --> 14:50.265
I can't believe the Griffins eat here
like everyday people!

We're, like, trying to eat here.

14:52.476 --> 14:53.810
Meg, put your bib on.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.229
I don't want to wear a bib.

14:55.312 --> 14:58.273
Meg, honey, it's very cold in here.

14:58.357 --> 15:00.859
Maybe you'd be more comfortable
with your bib on.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing.

15:22.464 --> 15:25.342
-We can't do the show without Meg.
-Why not?

15:25.467 --> 15:28.512
Our research shows she's
the least popular character on the show.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.180
But everyone loves the rest of you.

15:30.264 --> 15:33.809

they see you as a role model.

-Absolutely.

are all still under contract. Okay?

MEG: Why are we here?
PETER: No cameras!

16:14.391 --> 16:17.895
The TV executives don't want viewers
to think you're Meg Griffin.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.479
You're gonna let them recast me?

16:19.563 --> 16:22.191
It could've been worse.
They could've gone with Plan B.

we're taking Chris to soccer practice.
