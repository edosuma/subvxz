WEBVTT

00:02.233 --> 00:04.033
- OH, WHAT'S TO EAT?

00:04.067 --> 00:05.667
- OH, YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE
HUNGRY.

00:05.700 --> 00:09.200
YOU SPENT THE WHOLE P.T.A
MEETING AT THE BUFFET TABLE.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.500
AND WHAT IS THAT ON YOUR SHIRT?

00:18.400 --> 00:20.400
- CHOCOLATE PUDDING.

00:20.433 --> 00:22.200
YEAH.

00:22.233 --> 00:23.867
WANT SOME?

00:23.900 --> 00:25.067
- UGH.

00:25.100 --> 00:27.700
I MEAN, BY THE WAY,
YOU COULDN'T WEAR A NICER SHIRT

00:27.733 --> 00:28.900
TO THE P.T.A. MEETING?

00:28.933 --> 00:32.433
- I DON'T WANNA GET CHOCOLATE
PUDDING ON A NICER SHIRT.

00:32.467 --> 00:35.300
- YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T EVEN CARE
HOW YOU LOOK.

00:35.333 --> 00:39.433
- OR SOUND ACT OR SMELL.
HELLO.

00:39.467 --> 00:41.700
- DEB, CAN WE
WATCH TV OVER HERE?

00:41.733 --> 00:42.967
FRANK FELL ASLEEP

00:43.000 --> 00:46.600
WITH THE REMOTE
TUCKED INTO HIS BOXERS.

00:48.467 --> 00:52.333
- AND THEN THE CHANNEL CHANGED
SO WE GOT THE HELL OUT OF THERE.

00:57.467 --> 01:00.100
- RAY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR SHIRT?

01:00.133 --> 01:01.200
- THANK YOU, AMY.

01:01.233 --> 01:02.933
LISTEN, RAY, THE P.T.A. MEETING
IS HERE NEXT WEEK,

01:02.967 --> 01:05.233
AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THAT.

01:05.267 --> 01:06.667
IT'S A REFLECTION ON ME.
- OH, COME ON!

01:06.700 --> 01:08.233
- NO, I MEAN, I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT PEOPLE THINK

01:08.267 --> 01:10.533
WHEN WE WALK IN
SOMEPLACE TOGETHER.

01:10.567 --> 01:12.333
THEY'RE THINKING,
"WHAT A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

01:12.367 --> 01:14.467
WITH HORRIBLY IMPAIRED VISION."

01:16.933 --> 01:18.933
- YEAH.

01:18.967 --> 01:20.200
WHAT IS AMY HERE?

01:20.233 --> 01:22.367
"LOOK OUT, LADY,
IT'S RIGHT BEHIND YA!"

01:28.900 --> 01:30.200
- ALL I'M SAYING, RAY,

01:30.233 --> 01:31.900
IS THAT WHEN THE P.T.A.
IS HERE NEXT WEEK,

01:31.933 --> 01:32.900
I WOULD APPRECIATE IT

01:32.933 --> 01:35.367
IF YOU WOULDN'T WALLOW
IN YOUR OWN FILTH.

01:35.400 --> 01:38.367
- [chuckles]
'CAUSE YOU'RE A PIG!

01:38.400 --> 01:39.933
- YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S ALL VERY FUNNY

01:39.967 --> 01:41.333
CONSIDERING
WHAT I HEARD PEOPLE SAY

01:41.367 --> 01:42.767
ABOUT HOW DEBRA
LOOKS TONIGHT.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.467
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:45.500 --> 01:47.433
- NOTHIN';
I WAS STANDIN' BY THE BUFFET,

01:47.467 --> 01:49.333
I OVERHEARD ONE
OF THE MOTHERS SAY,

01:49.367 --> 01:53.900
"I WONDER WHERE
THE REST OF HER DRESS IS?"

01:53.933 --> 01:54.967
- WHO SAID THAT?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.200
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:56.233 --> 01:58.333
THE WOMAN WHO'S ALWAYS THERE--
TALL, SKINNY.

01:58.367 --> 02:00.467
SHE WAS BLOCKIN'
THE BEAN DIP.

02:03.867 --> 02:05.367
- LIZ SHARPE?

02:05.400 --> 02:06.733
SHE COMPLIMENTED ME
ON THIS DRESS.

02:06.767 --> 02:08.733
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:08.767 --> 02:10.333
- I'M JUST TELLIN' YA WHAT THEY
WERE SAYING, ALL RIGHT?

02:10.367 --> 02:12.700
- WHAT "THEY"?
WAS THERE SOMEBODY ELSE?

02:12.733 --> 02:14.533
- SHE SAID THAT,
AND THEN THE OTHER WOMAN SAID,

02:14.567 --> 02:17.100
"YEAH. THAT DRESS
MAKES HER LOOK"--

02:21.467 --> 02:23.133
- WHAT?

02:23.167 --> 02:26.933
- "TRAMPY."

02:26.967 --> 02:28.133
- TRAMPY?

02:28.167 --> 02:30.800
I--WHY WOULD
THEY SAY THAT?

02:30.833 --> 02:33.433
- OH, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
THAT DRESS LOOKS FANTASTIC.

02:33.467 --> 02:36.667
YOU HAVE A GREAT BODY AND YOU'RE
NOT AFRAID TO SHOW IT.

02:47.367 --> 02:51.100
IS WHAT I THINK
AMY IS THINKING.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.633
RIGHT, "HOT STUFF"?

02:57.267 --> 02:59.900
- DEB, DON'T PAY
ANY ATTENTION TO THOSE WOMEN.

02:59.933 --> 03:01.433
THEY'RE JUST JEALOUS.

03:01.467 --> 03:03.367
THEY WISH THEY HAD
THE COURAGE TO WEAR

03:03.400 --> 03:05.500
WHAT THE KIDS TODAY
ARE WEARING.

03:09.767 --> 03:12.367
YOU KNOW, AT OUR AGE.

03:14.667 --> 03:16.300
- THANKS, AMY.

03:16.333 --> 03:17.800
OKAY, WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:17.833 --> 03:19.500
I'M GONNA CALL IT
A NIGHT.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.467
- OH, WOW.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.233
I DIDN'T WANT HER
TO FEEL HORRIBLE.

03:25.267 --> 03:27.233
NICE GOIN', AMY.

03:29.833 --> 03:32.333
- I DID NOT MEAN THAT
THE WAY IT SOUNDED.

03:32.367 --> 03:33.800
I MEANT IT
AS A COMPLIMENT.

03:33.833 --> 03:36.533
SHE'S ADORABLE.
EVERYBODY THINKS THAT.

03:36.567 --> 03:38.633
ISN'T SHE ADORABLE, ROBERT?

03:51.833 --> 03:52.967
- HEY.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.167
DO YOU HAVE ANY RUBBING ALCOHOL?

03:54.200 --> 03:56.000
I GOT THE REMOTE FROM DAD.

03:56.033 --> 03:57.067
- HEY, NO, NO,
DON'T, DON'T.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.433
OH, COME ON!

03:58.467 --> 04:01.033
NOW WE GOT TO
THROW AWAY THE TABLE.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.633
- HOW'S DEB DOIN'?

04:07.667 --> 04:08.800
SHE SEEMED PRETTY UPSET.

04:08.833 --> 04:11.367
- YEAH, SHE'S ACTUALLY MOPING
AROUND ALL MORNING.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.533
- OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

04:12.567 --> 04:14.467
- WELL, AMY'S GONNA COME OVER
LATER TO APOLOGIZE.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.567
SHE FELT TERRIBLE
FOR WHAT SHE SAID.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.700
- I SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE
MENTIONED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

04:18.733 --> 04:20.100
- YOU WERE PROBABLY RIGHT
TO DO IT.

04:20.133 --> 04:22.767
YOU DON'T WANT DEB TO THINK THAT
THESE PEOPLE ARE HER FRIENDS.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.833
SHE SHOULD KNOW THE TRUTH.

04:24.867 --> 04:29.200
- YEAAAAAH...WELL...

04:29.233 --> 04:31.800
THE TRUTH...

04:42.133 --> 04:43.633
- WHAT?

04:43.667 --> 04:45.900
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

04:45.933 --> 04:48.433
YOU KNOW--YOU KNOW, UH, LIZ--
WHATEVER HER NAME IS

04:48.467 --> 04:51.600
AND THOSE OTHER WOMEN--
WHAT THEY SAID?

04:51.633 --> 04:53.400
I MADE IT UP.

04:57.767 --> 05:00.800
- YOU MADE IT UP?

05:00.833 --> 05:03.067
- YEAH, AND I FEEL KINDA BAD.

05:06.300 --> 05:09.200
- "KINDA BAD"?
YOU SHOULD BE IN JAIL!

05:09.233 --> 05:11.367
WHY...WHY WOULD YOU
EVEN DO THAT?

05:11.400 --> 05:15.933
- I DON'T KNOW.
I LIE, I GUESS.

05:15.967 --> 05:18.367
I MEAN, DEBRA WAS JUST GETTIN'
ON ME ABOUT BEIN' A SLOB,

05:18.400 --> 05:19.600
AND SHE WAS DRESSED ALL,

05:19.633 --> 05:21.700
"LOOK AT THIS, LOOK AT THAT,
LOOK AT THIS"!

05:21.733 --> 05:23.733
YOU KNOW THAT LITTLE PART
IN YOUR BRAIN

05:23.767 --> 05:26.967
THAT DOESN'T THINK THINGS
ALL THE WAY THROUGH?

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
- THAT'S NOT THE LITTLE PART
OF YOUR BRAIN.

05:34.533 --> 05:35.667
YOU GOTTA TELL HER, RAYMOND.

05:35.700 --> 05:36.767
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.633
I'M JUST WAITIN' FOR
THE RIGHT MOMENT, THAT'S ALL.

05:56.100 --> 05:59.600
- HEY, DEB!
LOOKIN' GOOD!

06:09.333 --> 06:11.933
- HEY. YOU'RE DRESSED
KINDA CASUAL

06:11.967 --> 06:14.167
EVEN FOR "CHILLIN' OUT."

06:16.333 --> 06:19.333
- AT LEAST I'M DRESSED
"AGE APPROPRIATELY."

06:20.833 --> 06:22.967
- YEAH, LISTEN...

06:23.000 --> 06:26.833
ABOUT THAT...

06:26.867 --> 06:30.533
AMY FEELS BAD.

06:30.567 --> 06:33.033
- I KNOW SHE DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT MY FEELINGS.

06:33.067 --> 06:35.933
- LOOK, I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE
WEARING A DRESS LIKE THAT.

06:35.967 --> 06:37.333
- I'VE WORN IT SO MANY TIMES.

06:37.367 --> 06:39.067
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE

06:39.100 --> 06:40.700
THINK I LOOK TRAMPY.

06:40.733 --> 06:44.933
- OH, THEY DON'T THINK THAT,
TRUST ME.

06:44.967 --> 06:46.933
- AND YOUR MOTHER'S MADE
HER SHARE OF COMMENTS

06:46.967 --> 06:48.500
OVER THE YEARS.

06:48.533 --> 06:51.100
I'VE ALWAYS JUST
DISMISSED THEM BECAUSE SHE'S,

06:51.133 --> 06:54.267
YOU KNOW,
HORRIBLE, BUT...

06:56.133 --> 06:57.933
MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT.

06:57.967 --> 06:59.167
I MEAN,
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

06:59.200 --> 07:01.600
SHE'S ONLY SAYIN' WHAT EVERYBODY
ELSE HAS BEEN THINKIN'.

07:01.633 --> 07:07.333
I'M JUST A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
WHO'S FOOLIN' HERSELF.

07:07.367 --> 07:09.600
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK, DEB,
I GOTTA TELL YA SOMETHING--

07:09.633 --> 07:11.767
- YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY BUGS ME
IS THAT WORD "TRAMPY."

07:11.800 --> 07:15.933
I MEAN, I KNOW THAT DRESS IS
A LITTLE LOW CUT, BUT "TRAMPY"?

07:15.967 --> 07:18.033
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE GOIN'
OUT OF THEIR WAY TO INSULT ME.

07:18.067 --> 07:21.133
WHAT IS WITH THESE WOMEN?
DON'T THEY HAVE BIGGER ISSUES?

07:21.167 --> 07:22.767
AND HOW 'BOUT SAYIN' IT
TO MY FACE

07:22.800 --> 07:24.667
INSTEAD OF GOIN' BEHIND MY BACK,
YOU KNOW?

07:24.700 --> 07:27.967
THAT IS SO DAMN UNDERHANDED.
WHAT KIND OF A PERSON DOES THAT?

07:28.000 --> 07:31.533
- I HATE THEM!
- I KNOW!

07:31.567 --> 07:32.700
- HUH?

07:32.733 --> 07:34.800
- WHO ARE THEY TO JUDGE YOU?
THEY'RE JEALOUS!

07:34.833 --> 07:36.900
DID YOU SEE THAT LIZ SHARPE
THE OTHER NIGHT?

07:36.933 --> 07:38.267
WOO-HOO!

07:38.300 --> 07:40.467
SHE'S ONLY WANT YOUR DRESS
IF IT WAS DEEP-FRIED

07:40.500 --> 07:42.500
AND COVERED IN SPRINKLES.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.200
- LIZ IS PRETTY SKINNY.

07:50.233 --> 07:52.600
- SHE'S A COW.
- YOU THINK?

07:52.633 --> 07:54.700
- MOOOO!

07:54.733 --> 07:55.800
THAT'S A COW!

07:55.833 --> 07:57.733
SO YOU SHOULDN'T LET
THOSE WOMEN GET YOU DOWN.

07:57.767 --> 08:01.767
THEY'RE JUST A BUNCH OF
UPTIGHT, CATTY HAUSFRAUS

08:01.800 --> 08:07.567
WHO ONLY GET EXERCISE WHEN THEY
WRESTLE HAM FROM EACH OTHER.

08:12.067 --> 08:15.667
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE
GONNA BE OVER HERE NEXT WEEK.

08:15.700 --> 08:16.767
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:16.800 --> 08:18.567
I SAY WE DON'T EVEN LET 'EM
IN THIS HOUSE.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.000
I SAY NO P.T.A. MEETING.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.367
IN FACT, WE SHOULD
SWITCH SCHOOLS.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.700
- OH, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

08:23.733 --> 08:26.767
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHO CARES WHAT THEY THINK?

08:26.800 --> 08:29.133
IT'S GOOD YOU DON'T CARE
WHAT THEY THINK.

08:29.167 --> 08:30.233
- I DON'T CARE.

08:30.267 --> 08:31.467
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:31.500 --> 08:33.867
IF YOU DON'T CARE,
THEN I DON'T CARE.

08:33.900 --> 08:35.600
- THANKS, RAY.

08:36.733 --> 08:38.633
- IT'S OKAY. I'M...

08:38.667 --> 08:40.167
I'M THERE FOR YOU.

08:48.900 --> 08:51.500
I LIKE YOU COVERED IN CHIPS.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.000
- HI, RAY.

08:58.033 --> 08:59.133
YOU LOOK NICE.

08:59.167 --> 09:00.867
ARE YOU GOING SOMEPLACE
AFTER THIS?

09:00.900 --> 09:02.033
- NO.

09:02.067 --> 09:05.633
THIS IS WHAT I WEAR WHEN I'M
KNOCKIN' AROUND THE HOUSE.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.767
AH, SHRIMP.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.800
GOOD OL' SHRIMP.

09:42.633 --> 09:44.333
AH.

09:44.367 --> 09:45.433
ANYBODY HAVE SOME CLUB SODA?

09:45.467 --> 09:49.300
I CAN'T LET DEBRA
SEE ME LIKE THIS.

09:53.400 --> 09:54.800
- HELLO.

09:54.833 --> 09:55.667
IS EVERYBODY HERE?

09:55.700 --> 09:57.800
SHOULD WE GET
THE MEETING STARTED?

10:08.700 --> 10:12.000
DOES ANYBODY ELSE NEED
ANYTHING TO EAT OR DRINK?

10:14.133 --> 10:15.767
- WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

10:15.800 --> 10:16.833
- NOTHING.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.800
YOU HAVE A LITTLE COCKTAIL SAUCE
ON YOUR SHIRT.

10:18.833 --> 10:21.133
- AT LEAST I HAVE A SHIRT.

10:23.033 --> 10:24.500
- LIZ...

10:24.533 --> 10:27.700
WOULD YOU LIKE TO START OFF WITH
THE FUNDRAISER FOR THE LIBRARY?

10:33.767 --> 10:37.100
- I-I WAS...
JUST GONNA SAY THAT THE...

10:37.133 --> 10:38.433
[clears throat]

10:38.467 --> 10:42.167
BOOK DONATIONS FROM THE JUNIOR
COLLEGE MIGHT BE DELAYED.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.567
- HMM. YOU SEEM
A LITTLE DISTRACTED, LIZ.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.867
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

10:45.900 --> 10:49.233
- I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, DEBRA.

10:49.267 --> 10:51.167
- OH, RAY TOLD ME EVERYTHING.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.567
- ALL RIGHT,
ENOUGH OF THE CHIT-CHAT.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.467
OKAY, SO WHERE ARE WE
ON THESE BOOK THINGS, OKAY?

10:54.500 --> 10:56.700
THIS IS THE FIRST
I'M HEARING OF ANY DELAY,

10:56.733 --> 10:59.833
AND THIS IS TOTAL BULL,
AND IT IS AN OUTRAGE!

10:59.867 --> 11:01.067
AND I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF BOOKS,

11:01.100 --> 11:02.900
BUT THE KIDS SHOULD HAVE 'EM,
DAMN IT!

11:02.933 --> 11:04.800
OKAY?

11:04.833 --> 11:07.700
- FRANK, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO BROKE THE TV.

11:21.200 --> 11:26.133
- WE'RE HAVING A P.T.A. MEETING.
CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?

11:26.167 --> 11:29.767
- YES. WE'D LIKE
TO JOIN THE P.T.A.

11:39.467 --> 11:41.300
- DEBRA...

11:41.333 --> 11:44.600
WHY ON EARTH
ARE YOU DRESSED THAT WAY?

11:44.633 --> 11:47.967
- TRUST ME, MARIE,
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.100
- DO YOU?

11:50.133 --> 11:53.467
DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE?

11:53.500 --> 11:56.167
- ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOIN' HERE?

11:56.200 --> 11:57.367
- WELL, I LOST THE REMOTE,

11:57.400 --> 12:00.733
SO DAD THREW HIS SHOE
AT THE TV AND BROKE IT.

12:00.767 --> 12:03.800
- IT'S OKAY.
I LIKE THIS SHOW.

12:06.433 --> 12:08.300
- EVERYONE,
I THINK WE SHOULD GO.

12:08.333 --> 12:10.967
- OKAY. WELL, THANKS
FOR COMING OVER.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.233
WE SHOULD DO THIS AGAIN.

12:12.267 --> 12:16.333
OH! I'LL SEE YA
AT THE CHURCH PICNIC!

12:16.367 --> 12:19.267
- NEXT TIME WE'LL ALL
DRESS LIKE PIRATES.

12:21.467 --> 12:23.400
- YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE EMBARRASSED, RAY.

12:23.433 --> 12:26.333
AFTER WHAT THEY SAID,
I DON'T CARE.

12:26.367 --> 12:28.200
- WHAT DID "THEY" SAY?

12:28.233 --> 12:29.867
- YOU KNOW.

12:29.900 --> 12:33.933
ROBERT, "THEY" SAID THAT
DEBRA DRESSES A LITTLE TRAMPY.

12:33.967 --> 12:37.000
- I THINK THEY WERE BEING KIND.

12:41.300 --> 12:44.733
- MARIE, I ONLY WORE THIS
TO MAKE A POINT.

12:44.767 --> 12:46.400
- GOT IT!

12:50.933 --> 12:54.533
- DEBRA, I'M NOT GOING
TO LECTURE YOU ON DECORUM

12:54.567 --> 12:56.867
BECAUSE I BELIEVE YOU WON'T
LISTEN TO ME, BUT I REALLY--

12:56.900 --> 12:59.567
- MARIE, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
MAKE ME FEEL BAD.

12:59.600 --> 13:00.433
I LIKE THE WAY I DRESS.

13:00.467 --> 13:02.900
AND, BY THE WAY,
SO DOES YOUR SON.

13:02.933 --> 13:04.433
- THAT'S RIGHT.

13:20.867 --> 13:22.667
- I MEANT RAYMOND.

13:22.700 --> 13:25.533
I-I MEAN WHEN HE HEARD
WHAT THOSE WOMEN SAID ABOUT ME,

13:25.567 --> 13:28.700
HE WAS REALLY MAD,
RIGHT, RAY?

13:28.733 --> 13:30.600
- LISTEN, DEB...

13:30.633 --> 13:33.400
I THINK YOU MAY HAVE
MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT I WAS SAYIN'

13:33.433 --> 13:36.067
WHEN I TOLD YOU
ABOUT WHAT THOSE WOMEN SAID.

13:36.100 --> 13:37.933
- HOW DID I MISUNDERSTAND?

13:37.967 --> 13:40.233
- YOU BELIEVED ME.

13:47.133 --> 13:48.633
- WHAT?

13:48.667 --> 13:50.400
- I MADE IT UP.

13:51.967 --> 13:53.600
- YOU MADE IT UP?

13:53.633 --> 13:56.100
YOU MEAN THEY
NEVER CALLED ME TRAMPY?

13:56.133 --> 13:58.067
- NO, THEY DID NOT.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.133
BUT, SEE, THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS!

14:00.167 --> 14:02.800
YOU HAVE NICE FRIENDS
AT THE P.T.A.

14:02.833 --> 14:04.233
- YOU MEAN I USED TO!

14:04.267 --> 14:06.900
OH, MY GOD!
LOOK AT ME!

14:06.933 --> 14:07.967
OH, MY GOD!

14:08.000 --> 14:11.267
RAY, HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

14:11.300 --> 14:13.033
- I THINK HE HAD
A VERY GOOD REASON.

14:13.067 --> 14:14.367
YOU ASKED HIM
TO WEAR A CLEAN SHIRT,

14:14.400 --> 14:17.200
AND HE TOLD YOU
EVERYONE THINKS YOU'RE A TRAMP.

14:21.067 --> 14:23.333
- EXCUSE ME, BUT...

14:23.367 --> 14:27.467
A TRAMP CAN BE A LOVABLE
CHARACTER WHO RIDES THE RAILS.

14:30.133 --> 14:33.367
- I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU, RAY!

14:33.400 --> 14:35.233
DO YOU REALIZE
HOW HORRIBLE

14:35.267 --> 14:37.733
YOU MADE DEBRA
FEEL ABOUT HERSELF?

14:37.767 --> 14:41.633
JUST BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO ADMIT THAT YOU'RE A...

14:41.667 --> 14:43.533
SLOPPY GUY!

14:45.400 --> 14:47.333
- WHAT ARE YOU--
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID

14:47.367 --> 14:48.767
AT HER AGE SHE
SHOULD BE DRESSIN' LIKE

14:48.800 --> 14:51.167
SHE'S PUSHIN' A WALKER
ON HER WAY TO BINGO.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.067
- I NEVER SAID THAT!

14:53.100 --> 14:55.367
- YOU SAID EXACTLY THAT, AMY!

15:00.100 --> 15:02.200
NOW, LISTEN, DEB--

15:02.233 --> 15:03.867
I MAY HAVE SAID THOSE THINGS,

15:03.900 --> 15:07.200
BUT I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D COME
WALKIN' DOWN LIKE, UH, UH, UH...

15:07.233 --> 15:09.733
- "SIDEWALK SALLY"?
- YES!

15:10.867 --> 15:14.433
YES!

15:14.467 --> 15:16.500
WHY? WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

15:16.533 --> 15:18.633
- BECAUSE YOU MADE ME THINK
THEY HATED THE WAY I DRESSED!

15:18.667 --> 15:19.867
- JUST BECAUSE
THEY DIDN'T SAY IT

15:19.900 --> 15:21.400
DOESN'T MEAN
THEY DON'T THINK IT!

15:21.433 --> 15:23.900
- YEAH, I THINK MAYBE YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THE WAY I DRESS!

15:23.933 --> 15:27.367
- MAYBE I DO!

15:27.400 --> 15:29.567
- WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
INSTEAD OF PRETENDING

15:29.600 --> 15:31.400
IT WAS THE P.T.A.?

15:31.433 --> 15:34.367
- BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD
MEAN MORE COMING FROM THEM!

15:37.800 --> 15:39.800
- DEBRA, I MUST SAY,
THAT IN THIS INSTANCE,

15:39.833 --> 15:42.367
RAYMOND'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
ABOUT YOUR WARDROBE.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.200
- MARIE, YOU KNOW
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING

15:44.233 --> 15:46.133
I WOULD NORMALLY WEAR.

15:46.167 --> 15:48.133
- I SEE NO DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THIS

15:48.167 --> 15:50.400
AND ALL YOUR OTHER OUTFITS.

15:50.433 --> 15:52.000
- WHAT?

15:52.033 --> 15:54.333
- WHAT ABOUT
THAT RED DRESS OF YOURS?

15:54.367 --> 15:56.300
- WHAT RED DRESS?
- THE ONE WITH THE OPEN BACK.

15:56.333 --> 15:58.767
YOU WORE IT TO
MOM AND DAD'S ANNIVERSARY.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.700
- ROBERT?

16:09.733 --> 16:13.033
WHAT WAS I WEARING
AT YOUR PARENTS' ANNIVERSARY?

16:14.100 --> 16:17.600
- YOU...WERE...

16:17.633 --> 16:20.267
RAVISHING!

16:20.300 --> 16:24.733
IN A VERY LOVELY
SPRING ENSEMBLE.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.300
- CAN I JUST SAY ONE THING,
DEBRA?

16:32.333 --> 16:33.667
- I SAY SHE CAN'T.

16:36.533 --> 16:38.200
- THERE'S A TIME ARRIVES
IN A WOMAN'S LIFE

16:38.233 --> 16:40.267
WHEN SHE STILL
CAN SHOW HER BODY OFF

16:40.300 --> 16:42.367
BUT SHE SHOULDN'T.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.733
I-IT'S JUST NOT BECOMING
OF A LADY.

16:45.767 --> 16:49.667
AND I SAY THAT FOR EVERY YEAR
YOU'RE OVER 40,

16:49.700 --> 16:53.867
YOU SHOULD ADD AN INCH
TO THE HEMLINE OF YOUR DRESS.

16:53.900 --> 16:56.567
- WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD BE
DRAGGIN' AROUND A PERSIAN RUG!

17:08.867 --> 17:10.267
- WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ME.

17:10.300 --> 17:11.800
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DEBRA,

17:11.833 --> 17:14.933
WHO DOESN'T REALIZE THAT SHE'S
CROSSED THE LINE OF DECENCY!

17:14.967 --> 17:16.967
- OH, YOU THINK THIS
IS INDECENT?

17:17.000 --> 17:18.200
I'LL SHOW YOU INDECENT.

17:18.233 --> 17:20.033
GEE, IT'S A LITTLE WARM
IN MY HOUSE.

17:20.067 --> 17:23.200
I DON'T THINK I FEEL LIKE
WEARING A TOP ANYMORE!

17:23.233 --> 17:24.633
- OH!
OH, MY--

17:24.667 --> 17:26.000
OH, FRANK,
WE'RE LEAVING!

17:26.033 --> 17:28.967
DEBRA HAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM!

17:29.000 --> 17:31.367
- THEN LET'S HELP HER.

17:38.667 --> 17:41.100
- YEAH, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY ALL GO.

17:41.133 --> 17:43.300
THIS IS A PRIVATE MATTER
BETWEEN RAY AND DEBRA.

17:43.333 --> 17:44.567
C'MON, ROBERT.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.267
- YES. THIS HAS SUDDENLY
TAKEN A VERY UGLY TURN,

17:47.300 --> 17:51.200
AND I, FOR ONE, DO NOT
WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

18:07.233 --> 18:08.433
- WOW, THAT WAS--

18:08.467 --> 18:09.567
THAT WAS GREAT.

18:09.600 --> 18:12.600
YOU SCARED 'EM AWAY
WITH YOUR PEEP-SHOW THREAT.

18:13.633 --> 18:14.867
ALL RIGHT.

18:14.900 --> 18:16.100
WE GOTTA REMEMBER THAT MOVE.

18:16.133 --> 18:18.233
[laughs nervously]

18:19.900 --> 18:23.100
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN...

18:23.133 --> 18:25.067
LISTEN.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.233
YOU--YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT

18:26.267 --> 18:28.067
WHEN WE WALK IN A PLACE
TOGETHER,

18:28.100 --> 18:30.333
THE WAY I DRESS
IS A REFLECTION ON YOU.

18:30.367 --> 18:34.000
WELL...WELL, IT WORKS
THE OTHER WAY TOO, RIGHT?

18:34.033 --> 18:36.467
- WHAT IS WRONG
WITH HOW I DRESS?

18:36.500 --> 18:38.300
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT--

18:38.333 --> 18:41.900
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE ADVERTISIN'
SOMETHIN' THAT'S NOT FOR SALE!

18:41.933 --> 18:43.200
- WHAT, BECAUSE YOU OWN ME?

18:43.233 --> 18:45.633
- YEAH! NO!

18:45.667 --> 18:46.733
WELL...

18:46.767 --> 18:49.567
I OWN YOU AND YOU OWN ME.
THAT'S MARRIAGE.

18:49.600 --> 18:52.100
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
YOU MADE A BAD DEAL.

18:55.767 --> 18:56.833
- SO, WHAT?

18:56.867 --> 18:59.833
YOU WANT ME TO GO OUT
IN A PARKA AND SNOW PANTS?

18:59.867 --> 19:00.900
- NO.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.900
-OH, YOU WANT ME TO LOOK GOOD,
BUT NOT TOO GOOD?

19:02.933 --> 19:04.167
- YES.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.933
OH, COME ON.
WAIT, LOOK AT YOU.

19:05.967 --> 19:08.133
YOU'RE--YOU'RE SEXY.

19:08.167 --> 19:09.967
I MEAN, YEAH, I COULD PUT ON
SOME FINER CLOTHES

19:10.000 --> 19:11.567
AND--AND MAYBE NOT
WEAR SO MUCH FOOD.

19:11.600 --> 19:16.000
BUT I'M...
I'M STILL GONNA BE THIS.

19:16.033 --> 19:17.333
YOU KNOW,
WHEN WE WERE GOIN' OUT,

19:17.367 --> 19:19.067
PEOPLE WOULD SAY,
"WHAT'S THAT HOT GIRL

19:19.100 --> 19:23.367
DOIN' WITH THAT NOSE
WITH SNEAKERS?"

19:23.400 --> 19:25.200
AND--AND HERE WE ARE.

19:25.233 --> 19:27.833
WE'RE 15 YEARS LATER,
AND I'M STILL THE SAME OL' GUY,

19:27.867 --> 19:31.167
AND YOU'RE DRESSIN' ALL HOT
AND LOOKIN' ALL GREAT.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.533
I DON'T KNOW.

19:32.567 --> 19:35.533
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' FOR,
SOMEBODY IN YOUR OWN LEAGUE?

19:35.567 --> 19:37.433
- DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'M LOOKING?

19:37.467 --> 19:39.167
- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO THINK
WHEN YOU GO OUT

19:39.200 --> 19:42.700
DRESSED LIKE WONDER WOMAN?

19:42.733 --> 19:46.167
- I DRESS THE WAY I DRESS
BECAUSE I AM A HOUSEWIFE,

19:46.200 --> 19:47.833
WHICH IS GREAT
AND I LOVE THAT,

19:47.867 --> 19:51.600
BUT I DON'T ALWAYS WANT
TO DRESS LIKE A HOUSEWIFE.

19:51.633 --> 19:55.333
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME
WANTING TO GET AWAY FROM YOU.

19:55.367 --> 19:57.667
MOST OF THE TIME.

19:59.333 --> 20:01.433
AND YOU CAN PUT YOURSELF DOWN
ALL YOU WANT,

20:01.467 --> 20:03.133
BUT YOU ARE VERY GOOD-LOOKING!

20:03.167 --> 20:06.033
- OH, SHUT UP.
- NO.

20:06.067 --> 20:07.233
IT'S TRUE.

20:07.267 --> 20:08.533
IN FACT, YOU ARE
BETTER LOOKING NOW

20:08.567 --> 20:11.033
THAN YOU WERE
WHEN I MET YOU.

20:11.067 --> 20:12.333
I MEAN, IT'S NOT FAIR.

20:12.367 --> 20:13.933
YOU GET DISTINGUISHED
AND HANDSOME,

20:13.967 --> 20:15.900
AND I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
THE DAY I GET OUT OF BED

20:15.933 --> 20:19.733
AND EVERYTHING
HITS THE FLOOR.

20:19.767 --> 20:24.267
- YOU GOT A COUPLE OF YEARS LEFT
BEFORE THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

20:24.300 --> 20:26.333
- WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S A COMPLIMENT.

20:26.367 --> 20:29.067
I'LL TAKE IT.
I'LL TAKE ANY COMPLIMENT.

20:29.100 --> 20:30.767
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
PEOPLE SAY NICE THINGS

20:30.800 --> 20:34.667
ABOUT THE WAY I DRESS,
AND I GUESS I LIKE THAT.

20:34.700 --> 20:35.667
- WELL, YEAH, BUT--

20:35.700 --> 20:38.767
WHO'S SAYIN'
NICE THINGS TO YOU?

20:38.800 --> 20:41.000
- JUST... PEOPLE.

20:41.033 --> 20:43.667
BUT A LOT OF TIMES
I NEVER GET THAT

20:43.700 --> 20:44.800
FROM YOU.

20:44.833 --> 20:48.233
- WHAT?
YOU KNOW I THINK YOU'RE HOT!

20:48.267 --> 20:51.233
- YES, I KNOW WHEN I GO TO BED
AND TURN OFF MY LIGHT

20:51.267 --> 20:53.233
I WILL GET MAULED.

21:00.767 --> 21:04.933
- IT WOULD BE NICE TO HEAR IT
WITH WORDS SOMETIMES...

21:04.967 --> 21:07.833
DURING THE DAY!

21:07.867 --> 21:10.533
WHEN I HAVE CLOTHES ON.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.133
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?

21:15.167 --> 21:17.533
- YES. I'M SORRY.

21:17.567 --> 21:18.867
I'M SORRY I DID
WHAT I DID

21:18.900 --> 21:22.433
AND THAT NOW WE REALLY
HAVE TO SWITCH SCHOOLS.

21:25.067 --> 21:27.633
MADAME BOOBY...

21:33.000 --> 21:35.833
- I'M GOING TO GO CHANGE.

21:35.867 --> 21:37.767
OKAY.

21:43.033 --> 21:45.933
- HEY, UH, YOU MIGHT NEED HELP
GETTIN' OUT OF THAT.

21:45.967 --> 21:48.000
THAT'S PRETTY TIGHT.
