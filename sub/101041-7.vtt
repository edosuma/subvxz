14:23.729 --> 14:26.398

this is the kind of trick

26:09.601 --> 26:12.103
you would use
a trained magic assistant,

26:12.137 --> 26:13.672
someone--yeah, exactly.

26:13.705 --> 26:16.508
No, someone who worked with a
magician for many, many years,

26:16.541 --> 26:18.777
you know, figuring out
exactly how it works.

26:18.810 --> 26:20.745
- You're already
making bad choices.

26:20.779 --> 26:21.913
- No, no, it's gonna be great.

26:21.947 --> 26:23.848
I don't have any
magic assistants,

26:23.882 --> 26:26.751
but I do have Alyson Hannigan.

26:26.785 --> 26:28.520
Exactly, exactly.
[cheers and applause]

26:28.553 --> 26:31.423
I'm gonna train you
in real time

26:31.456 --> 26:33.625
how to do this trick, and then
we're gonna fool everybody

26:33.658 --> 26:35.760
with a little Las Vegas
magic illusion.

26:35.794 --> 26:38.363
It's gonna be fun.
Let's take a look at it.

26:38.396 --> 26:39.731
Here it is, Alyson.

26:39.764 --> 26:42.801
There it is, a little thing
I like to call

26:42.834 --> 26:45.470
the Arm Chopper of Doom!

26:45.503 --> 26:47.138
That's good.
- [echoing] Doom, doom, doom.

26:47.172 --> 26:48.473
- [chuckles]
That's good.

26:48.506 --> 26:50.275
That was just a test.

26:50.308 --> 26:51.543
That was a test.
No, it was.

26:51.576 --> 26:53.445
- I can see why you
don't have an assistant.

26:53.478 --> 26:55.614
[laughter]

26:55.647 --> 26:56.948
- Here's what's
gonna happen, Alyson.

26:56.982 --> 26:59.217
In a moment, you're gonna place
your arm inside here.

26:59.250 --> 27:00.585
- I don't know if I'm gonna.

27:00.619 --> 27:01.753
- It'll be fine.
I promise.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.154
I'm gonna teach you
how it works.

27:03.188 --> 27:04.489
You'll be absolutely safe.

27:04.522 --> 27:06.224
After your arm is inside,

27:06.257 --> 27:08.193
I will take
this blade right here.

27:08.226 --> 27:09.661
I will slam that blade--

27:09.694 --> 27:12.497
I mean I will gently
push that blade downward.

27:12.530 --> 27:14.432
It will go
right through your arm,

27:14.466 --> 27:18.370
and this audience
will go nuts with applause.

27:18.403 --> 27:20.505
That's if it works.
That's if it works.

27:20.538 --> 27:23.274
If it doesn't work,
I will slam the blade down,

27:23.308 --> 27:26.778
your arm will fall off,
and Penn will call 911.

27:26.811 --> 27:29.681
- Ugh.
[laughter]

27:29.714 --> 27:31.049
- I can see you are
a little nervous.

27:31.082 --> 27:33.518
Please don't be nervous.
You're a huge celebrity.

27:33.551 --> 27:34.953
I would never risk
your arm in this.

27:34.986 --> 27:37.589
It's really not that sharp.
Look, not that sharp.

27:37.622 --> 27:40.025
If this is your arm,
won't even cut a bal--

27:40.058 --> 27:42.827
[laughter]

27:48.233 --> 27:49.701
I'm sure you're stronger
than a balloon.

27:49.734 --> 27:51.302
You'll be fine.
Okay.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.905
[chuckles nervously]

27:53.938 --> 27:55.473
I'm a little nervous now.
All right.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.742
I--Alyson,
step a little closer--

27:57.776 --> 27:59.310
- Why don't we do it
with your arm?

27:59.344 --> 28:00.578
I know how to chop.

28:00.612 --> 28:02.714
- It's always the assistant
that has to go into it.

28:02.747 --> 28:05.350
That's just the rules.
- No, magic's evolving.

28:05.383 --> 28:07.318
- Sure, that's a good point.
- Yeah.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.320
- Okay, help me out, Alyson.

28:09.354 --> 28:10.689
Are you right-handed
or left-handed?

28:10.722 --> 28:12.257
- Right-handed.
- Right-handed?

28:12.290 --> 28:13.391
Oh, good.
We're using the good one.

28:13.425 --> 28:14.859
Take your right hand--
- Oh!

28:14.893 --> 28:16.361
- Take your right hand
and hold it up

28:16.394 --> 28:17.996
high in the air
just like this--just like this.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.097
That's nice.
Right up there.

28:19.130 --> 28:20.598
Ooh, those are lovely nails.
Thank you.

28:20.632 --> 28:22.167
Open up all your fingers.
Wonderful.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.703
And wave good-bye to your hand.

28:24.736 --> 28:27.505
Sorry--your fans.
Wave good-bye to your fans.

28:27.539 --> 28:28.873
That's what I meant.
Here we go.

28:28.907 --> 28:31.543
Let us just expose the flesh
a little bit.

28:31.576 --> 28:33.044
That's great.
Alyson, you're so brave.

28:33.078 --> 28:35.013
Thank you for helping out.
Let's see--no, no.

28:35.046 --> 28:37.215
You'll be good, I promise.
You'll be--that's very nice.

28:37.248 --> 28:39.084
That's good--ah, thank you.
I got you in there.

28:39.117 --> 28:41.086
Now, it's kind of custom fit
to your arm.

28:41.119 --> 28:42.587
I just close
that little bit there.

28:42.620 --> 28:43.922
We lock it into place.

28:43.955 --> 28:46.691
We close this here.
We lock into place.

28:46.725 --> 28:50.095
That prevents you...
from getting away.

28:50.128 --> 28:52.130
[laughter]
You know what?

28:52.163 --> 28:53.598
I'll take a little
of your fear away,

28:53.631 --> 28:54.799
I'll take a little
of your fear away.

28:54.833 --> 28:56.401
Can you feel this on your arm?
- Yeah.

28:56.434 --> 28:57.602
- You can feel that?
- Yes.

28:57.635 --> 28:59.337
- That's not good.
Let me numb it up.

29:01.840 --> 29:04.576
Oh, that's me.
[giggles]

29:04.609 --> 29:07.145
Now you know why we call it
the Arm Chopper of Doom.

29:07.178 --> 29:09.714
- [echoing]
Doom, doom, doom, doom.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.249
- That's good.
[laughs]

29:11.282 --> 29:12.383
Let's make it
a little more exciting.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.586
On the count of three. One--
- No!

29:14.619 --> 29:16.221
- Oh, you gotta watch.
That's what makes it exciting.

29:16.254 --> 29:18.389
All right.
That's good.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.226
On the count of three.
One, two--

29:21.259 --> 29:22.861
Three days ago,
I was doing this, Alyson.

29:22.894 --> 29:24.729
- Aww.
- [laughs]

29:24.763 --> 29:26.498
At the last second--
- I just wanna go home.

29:26.531 --> 29:27.665
- Oh, I can tell, I can tell,

29:27.699 --> 29:29.367
but it's gonna be great
at the end, Alyson.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.102
Think of the applause
you will get

29:31.136 --> 29:33.238
when we get through this thing.
- I mean, I've heard it before.

29:33.271 --> 29:35.106
I can remember it.
I don't need it anymore.

29:35.140 --> 29:37.108
- But you've never heard
the applause with me before,

29:37.142 --> 29:38.209
so this is good.

29:38.243 --> 29:40.111
Now, Alyson, sometimes
people get nervous

29:40.145 --> 29:41.446
right at this point.

29:41.479 --> 29:43.515
They pull their hand back,
and then blade comes down,

29:43.548 --> 29:45.083
it catches the tips
of their fingers.

29:45.116 --> 29:46.351
It really does hurt.

29:46.384 --> 29:48.686
Keep it right where it is
and it will not hurt.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.955
- I can't promise you that.
- As much.

29:50.989 --> 29:52.624
[laughter]
That's good.

29:52.657 --> 29:54.359
I got a better idea.
Take your other hand,

29:54.392 --> 29:56.060
reach around,
grab your own fingers.

29:56.094 --> 29:58.763
Yeah, take that hand,
reach around, grab--perfect.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.431
Yeah, just kind of hold on
just like that.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.567
Yeah, just kind of like this.
Yeah, yeah, perfect.

30:02.600 --> 30:03.535
That way, if something
goes wrong--

30:03.568 --> 30:05.904
- No!

30:05.937 --> 30:08.373
- That way, if something
goes wrong, you get a souvenir.

30:08.406 --> 30:11.142
- No!
- Okay, you know what?

30:11.176 --> 30:12.443
Let's do it this way
so everyone can see.

30:12.477 --> 30:13.878
I got better.
No, this'll be great.

30:13.912 --> 30:14.979
- Let's do it a different way.
I've got an idea.

30:15.013 --> 30:16.548
- We'll just have this

30:16.581 --> 30:19.083
so it gets a little bit
of extra--

30:19.117 --> 30:21.553
That's good. That's--
Are you ready for this?

30:21.586 --> 30:24.055
- Well, could we try it once
with your head in there?

30:24.088 --> 30:25.790
- My head's not gonna fit
in there, Alyson.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.926
What are we doing?
All right, here we go.

30:27.959 --> 30:30.428
It's just a thing we call
the Arm Chopper of Doom.

30:30.461 --> 30:33.598
- [echoing] Doom, doom, doom.
- Every time.

30:33.631 --> 30:35.099
Let's make it
a little more exciting.

30:35.133 --> 30:36.901
Seriously, Alyson,
don't worry, don't worry.

30:36.935 --> 30:39.804
You will be completely unarmed.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.439
[laughter]

30:41.472 --> 30:44.175
I mean unharmed.
Unharmed.

30:44.209 --> 30:45.343
We put this balloon here.

30:45.376 --> 30:46.611
Makes it a little more
exciting.

30:46.644 --> 30:48.112
If I face it
just the right way,

30:48.146 --> 30:50.014
the blade comes down,
slices the balloon in half,

30:50.048 --> 30:52.517
shoots off, hits Teller
right in the nose,

30:52.550 --> 30:54.752
blade keeps on coming
right through Alyson's arm,

30:54.786 --> 30:56.621
the crowd goes nuts
with applause.

30:56.654 --> 30:58.790
Are we ready for this?
- No!

30:58.823 --> 31:01.926
- It's...
- I heard no, I heard no.

31:01.960 --> 31:05.363
- The Arm Chopper of Doom!
- [echoing] Doom, doom, doom.

31:05.396 --> 31:07.866
- Here we go.
One, two, three.

31:07.899 --> 31:09.567
[screams]

31:09.601 --> 31:10.969
[sighs]

31:11.002 --> 31:14.639
[laughter]
Don't...

31:14.672 --> 31:15.940
don't move.

31:15.974 --> 31:17.242
One of two things
has happened.

31:17.275 --> 31:18.576
Either the trick has worked,

31:18.610 --> 31:20.879
or you're just
a really slow bleeder.

31:20.912 --> 31:23.047
I'm gonna pop this open,
I'm gonna pop this open,

31:23.081 --> 31:25.049
and your hand comes out,
and this crowd's gonna go wild

31:25.083 --> 31:29.053
for Alyson Hannigan.

31:29.087 --> 31:32.056
- Clinton W. Gray,
somebody I thought I liked.

31:32.090 --> 31:35.660
[laughs]
Aw.

31:35.693 --> 31:38.730
I just--why didn't you pick
someone in the audience?

31:38.763 --> 31:40.632
- We just knew you'd have
so much fun with it, Alyson.

31:40.665 --> 31:41.633
You're perf--and look.

31:41.666 --> 31:43.101
The outfit matched
and everything.

31:43.134 --> 31:44.936
- It matched my blood.
- Exactly.

31:44.969 --> 31:48.439
- Oh, so what other
torture devices do you use?

31:48.473 --> 31:50.642
- I do a thing with
a bear trap or an animal trap.

31:50.675 --> 31:52.110
It's kind of fun.

31:52.143 --> 31:54.946
Before I became a magician,
I was actually a rodeo clown,

31:54.979 --> 31:58.082
but I would do magic
in my rodeo clown act.

31:58.116 --> 32:01.185
I was Clinton W. Gray,
the Conjuring Cowboy Clown.

32:01.219 --> 32:04.455
So I do things like escaping
from a straitjacket

32:04.489 --> 32:07.025
while being dragged
around an arena by horses--

32:07.058 --> 32:08.359
that kind of stuff,
so yeah, yeah.

32:08.393 --> 32:10.028
- Will you come back
with that trick?

32:10.061 --> 32:11.796
- Sure. We'll think of that.

32:11.829 --> 32:14.799
It might be a little hard
to fit in here, but will do.

32:14.832 --> 32:17.535
- All right, shall we find out
if you fooled Penn and Teller?

32:17.568 --> 32:19.904
- Sure.
- All right, boys.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.073
- Clinton, the important thing
with a trick like this

32:22.106 --> 32:25.410
is how you handle the...victim.

32:25.443 --> 32:28.579
And you're supposed
to keep that person

32:28.613 --> 32:31.316
nervous and scared
and chatty

32:31.349 --> 32:33.217
and funny,
and you did all of that.

32:33.251 --> 32:34.485
Of course, you had
a great choice.

32:34.519 --> 32:36.554
With Alyson,
you can't go wrong.

32:36.587 --> 32:38.323
She's gonna make
the trick good,

32:38.356 --> 32:40.892
and she did that, and you were
great all the way through.

32:40.925 --> 32:44.295
What's interesting to me
is my partner, Teller,

32:44.329 --> 32:47.999
who--you finished this routine,
and Teller started sketching

32:48.032 --> 32:50.668
and talking, and, "What are we
gonna do with this?"

32:50.702 --> 32:52.303
and, "How are we gonna
figure this out?"

32:52.337 --> 32:56.240
And then he said,
"Maybe I'm just stupid."

32:56.274 --> 32:59.777
That was what Teller said:
"Maybe I'm just stupid."

32:59.811 --> 33:03.548
Now, Teller isn't stupid.
- No.

33:03.581 --> 33:05.850
- But in this case, I said,
"You know, Teller,

33:05.883 --> 33:07.585
"I think you are.

33:07.618 --> 33:10.388
"I think all of your theories

33:10.421 --> 33:13.391
"are not useful to this game.

33:13.424 --> 33:15.259
I think I have it figured out."

33:15.293 --> 33:17.295
So usually, I do a little

33:17.328 --> 33:18.930
chitter-chatter,
chitter-chatter,

33:18.963 --> 33:21.866
and then Teller goes up
and whispers to the magician

33:21.899 --> 33:24.569
some little piece
of arcane information,

33:24.602 --> 33:27.205
and the magician goes, "Oh,
yeah, yeah, you've got me,"

33:27.238 --> 33:28.806
and they go away.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.476
So we're not going with Teller
going up and whispering.

33:31.509 --> 33:34.245
We're going up
with me whispering.

33:34.278 --> 33:36.914
And if I tell you
how this is done,

33:36.948 --> 33:39.250
you do not receive a trophy.
- Okay.

33:39.283 --> 33:40.818
- If I am wrong...
- Yeah.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.453
- Then you get your trophy.
- All right.

33:42.487 --> 33:44.255
- So I'm gonna whisper
to you right now, Clinton.

33:44.288 --> 33:45.456
- Sure.

33:49.794 --> 33:52.597
That is exactly what I did.
- Yes, it is. Okay, thank you.

33:52.630 --> 33:55.333
But you did a great job.
Great job.

33:55.366 --> 33:56.634
[applause]

33:56.667 --> 33:57.769
- Well, you didn't fool them,

33:57.802 --> 33:59.804
but you sure
put on a great show

33:59.837 --> 34:01.839
that I'll think about
in my nightmares.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.841
- Well, thank you,
and, you know, it's just fun.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.877

- Hey, Debbie, how you doing?
- I'm great.

35:37.335 --> 35:39.370
How are you?
- I'm doing well.

35:39.403 --> 35:41.072
- Thank you, guys.

35:41.105 --> 35:42.974
- And now I'm gonna do

make sure there's no magnets,

35:50.348 --> 35:52.150
Obviously, Debbie,
I wouldn't give it to you

35:52.183 --> 35:55.119
if there's anything fishy, but
look it over a little bit here.

36:52.977 --> 36:55.479

that rope carefully.

36:55.513 --> 36:56.914

36:56.948 --> 36:58.316
Now I'm gonna
take scissors.

36:58.349 --> 37:00.384
You examined the rope--
no magnets, no nothing.

37:00.418 --> 37:03.087
I cut that right
in front of your eyes.

37:03.120 --> 37:05.423
And then, Deb, I'm gonna have
you take, I guess, that side.

37:05.456 --> 37:06.891

right there, Debbie,

37:06.924 --> 37:08.759

there, Deb.

cut the rope yourself.

37:35.419 --> 37:36.721
No way for me to fake that.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.256

Watch my fingers.

37:38.289 --> 37:39.890
There you go.
Right there, Debbie.

37:39.924 --> 37:43.527
And now, just like before, you
take that side of that, Deb.

37:43.561 --> 37:44.562
- Yup, yup, yup.
- Just like that.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.097
And then pull fast!
Pull fast!

37:46.130 --> 37:48.199
Boom--all back together
just like that!

37:48.232 --> 37:49.433
- What?
- Do your applause, Debbie.

37:49.467 --> 37:50.701
Do your applause.

37:50.735 --> 37:51.869
Do your applause here, Debbie.

37:51.902 --> 37:53.738
Do the applause there, Debbie.

37:53.771 --> 37:56.941
Do the applause there, Debbie.
- Whoo!

37:56.974 --> 37:58.943
- Now, Debbie, I know--
- Yes.

37:58.976 --> 38:02.847
- I know you wanna be part
of the "Stupid."

38:02.880 --> 38:05.316
I don't want you to leave here
without seeing any "Stupid."

38:05.349 --> 38:07.351
That's just not the way
to see Penn and Teller,

38:07.385 --> 38:09.153

how some magicians do this.

38:09.186 --> 38:10.655
- Okay.

38:10.688 --> 38:13.357
- They will take a little
extra piece of rope--

38:13.391 --> 38:16.327
a little extra, a little extra,

38:16.360 --> 38:17.528
a little extra piece of rope.

38:17.561 --> 38:20.264
There we go.
Little extra piece of rope.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.732
You can finish that over there.
It's only one piece.

38:21.766 --> 38:23.000
Do a little bit there.
- Much better at that.

38:23.034 --> 38:24.001
- Do a little bit there.

38:24.035 --> 38:25.603
Do a little bit over there.

38:25.636 --> 38:27.838
And what they'll do, Debbie, is
they'll take that piece of rope

38:27.872 --> 38:29.607
and they'll put it there
in their hand,

38:29.640 --> 38:30.908
but they don't hold it
like that.

38:30.941 --> 38:32.910
They hold it like this
so you can't see it.

38:32.943 --> 38:36.380
Then when they bring the rope
over, they add that piece in

38:36.414 --> 38:38.115
just like that,
so you're cutting this.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.451
You think you're cutting this,
you're really cutting this,

38:40.484 --> 38:42.586
then cutting this, then
somehow, they throw that away.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.455
But we're gonna do it for real

38:44.488 --> 38:46.424
with the real rope
you examined.

38:46.457 --> 38:49.126
And every other time, Debbie,
I have done this fast

38:49.160 --> 38:52.196
and pulling and in your hand
and all sorts of confusion.

38:52.229 --> 38:55.399
This time, so slow,
so easy, Debbie.

38:55.433 --> 38:57.468
Take that side of it.
Don't pull--don't pull it yet.

38:57.501 --> 38:59.970
Now, you know what's
gonna happen here, Debbie.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.540
You know it's gonna
go back together,

39:02.573 --> 39:05.176
but you can watch it
right there, clear, in my hand

39:05.209 --> 39:06.844
all back together
there, Debbie.

39:06.877 --> 39:08.346
Do your applause thing.
Do your applause thing.

39:08.379 --> 39:10.748
- Whoo!
- Do your applause over here.

39:10.781 --> 39:12.483
Do your applause thing
over here, Debbie.

39:12.516 --> 39:14.385
Beautiful, Debbie.
Beautiful, yeah.

39:14.418 --> 39:16.854
Now, Debbie, one more thing
I'm gonna show you,

39:16.887 --> 39:19.357
and that is woofle dust.

39:19.390 --> 39:20.858
Now, woofle dust,
you may not have heard,

39:20.891 --> 39:22.393
but woofle dust is amazing.

39:22.426 --> 39:24.195
It's like--oh, I dropped
a lot of that on the floor.

39:24.228 --> 39:25.863
You got this.

39:25.896 --> 39:29.700
Now, Debbie, this--this is
the magic of the whole thing.

39:29.734 --> 39:31.235
And don't worry
about us wasting rope.

39:31.268 --> 39:33.604
This is all recycled
from other shows.

39:33.637 --> 39:35.339
Now, Deb, what you're gonna
do is you're gonna take that

39:35.373 --> 39:36.574
in your hand...
- Yes.

39:36.607 --> 39:38.376
- But just take
a little bit of it in one hand.

39:38.409 --> 39:39.844
- Okay.
- Just a little bit--

39:39.877 --> 39:40.678
like, four or five pieces.
- All right, all right.

39:40.711 --> 39:41.946
- Yeah, actually,
in your right hand.

39:41.979 --> 39:43.047
- Okay.

39:43.080 --> 39:44.415
- And then just kind of--
for good luck,

39:44.448 --> 39:46.350
just kind of dribble that
over your shoulder.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.551
Just for good luck,
just dribble it.

39:47.585 --> 39:48.686

39:48.719 --> 39:50.788
Now, Debbie, now
you've got good luck.

39:50.821 --> 39:52.957
Now we'll do
the trick here, Debbie.

39:52.990 --> 39:55.192
We're gonna take--here,
just like before, and cut it,

39:55.226 --> 39:59.797
but this time, it'll happen
right before your very eyes.

39:59.830 --> 40:01.565
Move that to your right hand.
You'll see why.

40:01.599 --> 40:03.701
Hold this, but don't pull it,
in your left hand.

40:03.734 --> 40:06.270
Now, you see those
two pieces that we cut?

40:06.303 --> 40:08.305
I'll just take the woofle dust

40:08.339 --> 40:09.707
and just dribble it
right over that.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.542
No, close to that. And watch.
- Okay.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.377
- And right before

40:13.411 --> 40:16.280

40:20.618 --> 40:22.586

- We're going with one.

40:22.620 --> 40:25.623
- Do your applause, and you
can keep the rope, Debbie.

40:25.656 --> 40:29.460
And please, nobody tell her
how it was done.

- Good, how are you?

40:41.272 --> 40:42.840
- Good, good.

40:42.873 --> 40:45.576
- Well, that's a wrap
for us here at "Fool Us,"

40:45.609 --> 40:48.112
but with a little bit
of woofle dust,

40:48.145 --> 40:49.847
we'll reappear next week.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.916
See you then.

40:51.949 --> 40:54.685
Sorry about that.
- Oh, my gosh.
