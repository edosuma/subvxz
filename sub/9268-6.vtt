00:19.360 --> 00:21.200
Sancto spiritu.

00:27.400 --> 00:31.000
In gloria Dei patris. Amen.

00:55.240 --> 00:56.360
Dominus vobiscum.

01:56.720 --> 02:00.040
Amen. Amen.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.600
I thought I might find you here.

02:06.760 --> 02:10.080
I took it on myself to
make sure the body wasn't disturbed.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.480
Thank you, Father.

02:13.040 --> 02:16.960
Sergeant, secure the scene. And get
the police surgeon down here.

02:16.960 --> 02:21.880
I want a provisional theory
as to cause of death. Yes, sir.

02:21.880 --> 02:25.400
The colouration on the face would
suggest cyanide poisoning.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.120
I think I can take it from here.

02:29.480 --> 02:33.280
Very well, Inspector,
I'll leave it to you.

02:35.600 --> 02:39.800
Wipe your face. Sister
Mary Magdalene is we dare to hope,

02:39.800 --> 02:43.840
in the arms of Jesus. You'd be
better occupied praying for her soul

02:43.840 --> 02:48.480
rather than indulging in unseemly
histrionics. Sorry, sister.

02:52.280 --> 02:55.600
Oh, there's no need for this.
I'll thank you not to pull rank

02:55.600 --> 02:57.520
where the novices are concerned.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.560
This is not the way
we do things here.

02:59.560 --> 03:05.520
Get up dear. Stay where you are!
How dare you flout my authority.

03:05.520 --> 03:08.120
Authority's earned,
I think you'll find.

03:08.120 --> 03:12.000
Sister Bernadette. Go to the kitchen
and get yourself a cup of tea

03:12.000 --> 03:16.680
and something to eat. Quickly now.
You're as white as a sheet. Go.

03:19.880 --> 03:23.360
Inspector, this is our
new novice Mistress.

03:23.360 --> 03:25.880
Sister Paul. She arrived
last week from Calcutta.

03:25.880 --> 03:29.600
Where standards of discipline
were much higher.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.480
Is there any news, Inspector?

03:31.480 --> 03:33.760
The Police Surgeon has
provisionally mooted

03:33.760 --> 03:35.680
cyanide poisoning as cause of death.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.720
We can only assume,
it's some tragic accident.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.120
Sergeant, find out what
Sister Mary Magdalene

03:42.120 --> 03:44.480
ate and drank this morning.
I imagine nothing.

03:44.480 --> 03:47.560
She will have been observing
her fast before Holy Communion.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.520
As were we all.
Then I can only conclude

03:49.520 --> 03:51.120
she must have broken her fast.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.400
A wilful girl with a
streak of rebellion.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.040
Perhaps you have some duties
to attend to Sister.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.360
Do you know of any cyanide
kept on the premise?

04:02.360 --> 04:04.200
Lordy. Tons of the stuff!

04:04.200 --> 04:09.200
You need to speak to our Vintner,
Sister Boniface, she's in the winery.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.480
Nuns making wine?

04:11.480 --> 04:14.320
Our Lord asks for poverty,
chastity and obedience.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.360
He never said anything
about sobriety.

04:16.360 --> 04:17.399
Amen to that.

04:19.720 --> 04:23.280
In that case, if someone would be
kind enough to direct me.

04:23.280 --> 04:26.640
Our Sisters lead sheltered lives
and are unused to laymen.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.720
The presence of a chaperone
would be both reassuring

04:29.720 --> 04:31.760
and appropriate, I feel.

04:31.760 --> 04:33.880
Of course, Reverend Mother.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.840
You know our Chaplin, don't you?

04:35.840 --> 04:37.000
Father Brown.

04:43.520 --> 04:47.080
Tom. Father.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.800
Terrible business.

04:49.960 --> 04:53.480
Inspector Valentine. And you are?
Tom Evans.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.640
Can I ask your whereabouts between
nine and ten this morning?

04:56.640 --> 05:00.760
In the garden.
I'm the gardener.

05:00.760 --> 05:04.360
You live on site?
With my wife.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.080
Does she work at the Convent?

05:06.080 --> 05:08.360
They've enough women
to do their work.

05:08.360 --> 05:11.320
She does their shopping in
the village that's all.

05:11.320 --> 05:14.560
Did you know Sister Mary Magdalene?

05:14.560 --> 05:18.800
I don't talk to the novices.
It would be asking for trouble.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.000
I'll be sending someone
to take a statement

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
from you both as a matter
of routine. She's in Cheltenham.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.080
Her Mother's sick.
I've told her to stay there.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.040
How is Mrs Evans' Mother?

05:30.520 --> 05:33.440
TB. I'll keep remember them
in my prayers.

05:39.080 --> 05:43.960
One of yours? Lapsed. His wife
attends when her health permits.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.640
An invalid? Heart condition.

05:46.960 --> 05:50.400
I see the nuns are used to the
presence of one layman at least.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.400
The novices are refusing to drink

05:53.400 --> 05:55.840
from the water fountain
in case it's poisoned.

05:55.840 --> 05:58.720
Sister Lawrence says the
kitchen is in chaos.

05:58.720 --> 06:00.680
They're frightened. Or guilty.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.800
No doubt this deplorable incident

06:02.800 --> 06:06.040
will turn out to be some of
their juvenile horseplay.

06:06.040 --> 06:09.520
It's far too early to speculate.
Sloppy discipline stems

06:09.520 --> 06:12.200
from poor leadership,
which is hardly surprising

06:12.200 --> 06:14.680
given the character of
some in charge here.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.960
I didn't come all the way from India

06:18.960 --> 06:25.160
to find myself subordinate to my
spiritual and moral inferior.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.560
And if that person has
atoned for their sins?

06:29.560 --> 06:32.040
Covered up more like.

06:32.040 --> 06:35.040
The Order may be appraised,
but I wonder

06:35.040 --> 06:38.280
if the Diocese is aware
of their transgressions?

06:39.560 --> 06:43.200
In which case, maybe his Grace
should be informed immediately.

06:43.200 --> 06:47.720
Before another novice is poisoned.

06:47.720 --> 06:50.960
You do as you must, Sister.

06:50.960 --> 06:55.120
Oh, I will. Make no doubt of that.

07:03.320 --> 07:09.440
Hello? Thank you. Yes.
Yes. Put him through.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.840
Sister Mary Magdalene's father.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.920
I wish you luck explaining this one.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.240
I won't let you destroy St Agnes.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.800
And what exactly are you going
to do about it?

07:30.720 --> 07:32.680
Whatever I have to.

07:42.400 --> 07:43.920
Sister Boniface.

07:43.920 --> 07:47.480
Father Brown. I suspected you
might be on the case.

07:47.480 --> 07:49.920
Father Brown is
present as chaperone.

07:49.920 --> 07:54.320
He has no part in this
investigation. Righto.

07:54.320 --> 07:57.000
Inspector Valentine.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.640
Interesting choice of
reading matter, Sister.

07:59.640 --> 08:02.360
Oh, no disrespect to poor
Sister Mary Magdalene,

08:02.360 --> 08:05.240
but I couldn't help notice
the appearance of the corpse,

08:05.240 --> 08:07.720
and thought a spot
of research in order.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.240
With the help of Miss Christie.

08:10.240 --> 08:14.040
Do you think it was cyanide
poisoning, Father Brown?

08:14.040 --> 08:17.320
I am making no assumptions at this
stage in the investigation.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.280
A puzzling case.

08:19.280 --> 08:22.720
I expect you'll be only too glad
of Father Brown's help.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.320
Like Lord Peter Wimsey
and Inspector Parker.

08:55.240 --> 09:01.320
Sister Ignatius! Sister Ignatius!
How dare you run in God's house!

09:06.880 --> 09:10.000
Question. With cyanide being
such a fast acting poison,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.640
Sister Mary Magdalene
must have ingested it minutes

09:12.640 --> 09:15.440
before she entered the
chapel, but how and where?

09:18.280 --> 09:19.960
Potassium ferrocyanide.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.800
We use it to remove copper
and iron particles

09:22.800 --> 09:24.840
left in the wine by
bentonite and metals.

09:24.840 --> 09:28.600
There's enough to kill half of
Gloucestershire. Twelve bottles.

09:29.640 --> 09:31.920
Or should that be eleven?

09:31.920 --> 09:37.040
It appears you have a
cuckoo in the nest.

09:39.560 --> 09:42.160
Similar to the naked eye

09:42.160 --> 09:45.600
but it's tetrasodium
hexacyanoferrate,

09:45.600 --> 09:47.680
or sodium ferrocyanide.

09:47.680 --> 09:51.600
Bravo, Father. Your reputation
clearly isn't exaggerated.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.120
Is it toxic?

09:53.120 --> 09:56.280
Relatively non because the CN
ions are bound to the FE.

09:56.280 --> 09:59.560
If you don't mind.
Maybe you could...

09:59.560 --> 10:01.760
And chaperone silently.

10:02.920 --> 10:06.200
May God find you the grace
to make yourself worthy.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.960
Who has access to
the chemical stores?

10:22.960 --> 10:25.200
We don't keep things under
lock and key here.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.840
Ours is a community of trust.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.560
Yes?

10:31.560 --> 10:35.680
Gossips are sinful. Saint Paul lumps
them with murderers and God haters.

10:35.680 --> 10:40.560
Although I've always thought that
was a little harsh. Father?

10:40.560 --> 10:42.400
May I? Yes.

10:44.800 --> 10:50.640
It doesn't count as gossip if it's
pertinent to a police investigation.

10:51.960 --> 10:56.080
Right. Well, Sister Abelard found
anomalies in the stock take.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.760
She assumed it was a mistake

10:57.760 --> 11:01.240
but I thought - how peculiar?
Sister Abelard never makes mistakes.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.440
Double first in maths.
Brain like an adding machine.

11:06.280 --> 11:08.400
We call her Sister Abacus.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.280
Who's responsible for this?
Me. On my orders.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.600
You tampered with a crime scene.

11:29.600 --> 11:33.480
I put the sensibilities
of our Sisters first.

11:33.480 --> 11:36.880
Clear the scene. Organise a search
of the body and surrounding area,

11:36.880 --> 11:39.160
and take statements from everyone.
Yes, sir.

11:39.160 --> 11:42.160
And Sergeant, get the police
surgeon back. Yes, sir.

11:42.160 --> 11:45.160
And Sergeant...stop these bells!

11:57.600 --> 11:58.840
What are you doing?

11:58.840 --> 12:03.120
Oh! Sister Paul's relatives
need to be informed.

12:03.120 --> 12:06.480
So I'm looking for some
personal information.

12:06.480 --> 12:09.040
That's down to me, I think.

12:09.040 --> 12:13.040
Yes. Yes, of course,
Reverend Mother.

12:45.920 --> 12:50.240
What happens now, Inspector?
A search of the convent. All of it?

12:50.240 --> 12:54.200
Starting with the deceased nun's
cells and Sister Paul's office.

12:54.200 --> 12:58.160
Is that really necessary?

12:58.160 --> 12:59.720
I've two suspicious deaths.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.440
Anything less would be
grounds for my dismissal.

13:02.440 --> 13:06.680
No-one here has anything to hide.
Oh, we all have something to hide.

13:06.680 --> 13:08.880
Several things, in my case.

13:08.880 --> 13:12.680
I'm sure we'll manage to conduct
ourselves appropriately.

13:18.640 --> 13:22.400
Father, Sister Mary Magdalene,
would you say she was a looker?

13:22.400 --> 13:26.040
Holy Mary Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

13:26.040 --> 13:31.160
She was a Bride of Christ. Without
wrinkle or blemish of any kind.

13:31.160 --> 13:34.640
I'll take that as a "yes." I don't
think I like what you're implying.

13:36.880 --> 13:40.360
I told you to stay put.
You're making a show of yourself.

13:40.360 --> 13:44.200
They seem an ill matched couple.
And while the cat's away.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.920
Cooeee!

13:46.920 --> 13:49.320
Well you excuse me Inspector?

13:49.320 --> 13:51.200
Of course.
I'm sure I can manage.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.280
We just heard the news. Holy Mother.

13:55.280 --> 13:59.080
What a thing. And in a
convent of all places.

13:59.080 --> 14:03.040
Dreadful, Mrs McCarthy.
And who do we have here?

14:03.040 --> 14:08.680
My godchild. I'm in loco parentis
while mother's in hospital for...

14:08.680 --> 14:12.440
..for ailments you
needn't worry about.

14:12.440 --> 14:16.920
A proper little bruiser. And what's
your name my fine young fellow?

14:16.920 --> 14:18.600
Abigail.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.560
Hebrew for beautiful.

14:24.240 --> 14:28.840
Well, well, well. What have we here?

14:28.840 --> 14:32.640
Look's like we've got secret lush.
Sir!

14:36.960 --> 14:39.800
Get that to the lab please,
Sergeant.

14:39.800 --> 14:43.600
And you better find me Father Brown.
Yes, sir.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.040
What are you doing?

14:53.600 --> 14:57.320
Hello, Father.
I know what you're thinking.

14:58.440 --> 15:02.640
The murderer returns to
the scene of the crime.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.960
Is that a confession,
Sister Boniface?

15:05.960 --> 15:09.360
Ha! Very good, Father.

15:11.000 --> 15:16.160
Fact. Sister Paul was in full sight
for ten minutes before she died

15:16.160 --> 15:19.800
giving Sister Ignatius a record
tongue lashing by all accounts.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.680
But like Sister Mary Magdalene,

15:21.680 --> 15:25.960
the police found nothing to explain
how she ingested the poison.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.000
A conundrum.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.520
In Death In The Clouds,

15:30.520 --> 15:33.640
Madame Giselle was murdered
with a poisoned thorn.

15:33.640 --> 15:38.360
Dipped, as I recall, in the venom of
a South African boomslang snake.

15:39.360 --> 15:43.160
A poisonous species rarely
found in the Cotswolds.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.960
You are well read, Father.
I do love a mystery.

15:45.960 --> 15:47.920
On the subject of which,

15:47.920 --> 15:51.560
Inspector Valentine would like you
to make an identification.

15:53.400 --> 15:57.040
You confirm these as the items
missing from the winery?

15:57.040 --> 16:00.360
Yes. I expect you need to take
a statement from me.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.800
And fingerprints?

16:02.800 --> 16:05.440
In due course.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.640
We may have found our motive.

16:07.640 --> 16:10.680
Sister Mary Magdalene discovered
Sister Paul's alcoholism

16:10.680 --> 16:13.680
and theft and was poisoned
to keep her quiet.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.480
And then she poisoned herself?

16:16.640 --> 16:19.360
And then...

16:19.360 --> 16:23.840
..unable to live with the guilt,
took her own life.

16:23.840 --> 16:27.200
After finding time to berate
Sister Ignatius for ten minutes

16:27.200 --> 16:31.720
before she committed suicide.
And how was the poison ingested?

16:31.720 --> 16:34.480
The only items found on
the body were -

16:34.480 --> 16:38.320
reading glasses, handkerchief,
keys, notebook, pencil,

16:38.320 --> 16:40.920
ball of string
and a Swiss army penknife.

16:40.920 --> 16:43.240
I took notes. Very thorough.

16:43.240 --> 16:46.320
No doubt the post mortem will
shed light on the matter.

16:49.680 --> 16:54.120
Alcoholism and petty theft -
a motive for murder?

16:54.120 --> 16:56.920
To compound venal sin with
so heinous a mortal sin?

16:56.920 --> 16:59.080
Followed by suicide.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.080
The ultimate mortal sin.

17:03.640 --> 17:07.160
If you'll allow the police to get
on with their investigation,

17:07.160 --> 17:09.920
I'm sure things will
become clear in due course.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.319
Shush.

17:31.440 --> 17:35.200
Now look what you've done.
Takes a man to wake a baby.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.080
Abigail!

17:38.080 --> 17:40.840
I wondered if you'd like me
to include your mother

17:40.840 --> 17:45.520
in prayers for the sick
at mass on Sunday? Thank you.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.760
In we go.
I'm in awe of your industry.

17:51.800 --> 17:55.840
Mrs Evans is the star of my
African knitting circle.

17:55.840 --> 18:01.120
Now nothing awry there,
and fed an hour ago.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.960
So it must be teeth.

18:06.840 --> 18:10.000
I have a teething bar
somewhere in my handbag.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.920
He wants his mother.
It's a girl.

18:20.360 --> 18:24.280
Any news from the police, Father?
I'm afraid they left none the wiser.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.920
Shush. I'm here.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.640
Who's that?

18:30.640 --> 18:31.880
She is my godchild.

18:44.120 --> 18:45.480
I'll be wanting my tea.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.200
And were you acquainted
with the dead nuns, Mr Evans?

19:05.880 --> 19:09.800
She's a weak heart. I'll thank you
not to upset her with all this talk.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.840
Anyway. It's their own fault.

19:13.840 --> 19:16.680
All them chemicals left lying
around in the winery.

19:16.680 --> 19:18.880
Didn't I say it was an
accident in waiting?

19:28.120 --> 19:31.400
Poor woman. All that knitting.

19:31.400 --> 19:35.640
When anyone can see she's desperate
for one of her own. God willing.

19:35.640 --> 19:38.760
She'd be better off with
a willing husband.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.160
I'm not one to gossip, Father.

19:44.320 --> 19:47.480
Lady Felicia's cousin, Lord Compton,
had to let him go

19:47.480 --> 19:50.160
on account of "trouble"
with the housemaids.

19:50.160 --> 19:54.480
And the scullery maids. Oh, and the
dairy maids, I shouldn't wonder.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.600
If Mother Augustine hadn't
taken Christian pity on them,

19:57.600 --> 20:01.880
they'd be in the workhouse.
No wonder he's lapsed.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.440
Wouldn't dare show his face
in church again.

20:06.800 --> 20:12.400
These thy gifts, which we are about
to receive from thy bounty.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.680
Through Jesus Christ our Lord.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.040
Amen.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.520
My compliments to the Chef.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.640
This can't go on much longer.

20:35.640 --> 20:38.440
Let us pray that the police
find a solution.

20:38.440 --> 20:41.640
That this was nothing more than
a tragic accident.

20:41.640 --> 20:45.440
Of course it was. Who would want
to kill that poor sweet girl.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.080
Or Sister Paul.

20:47.080 --> 20:50.160
Most of the novices,
they couldn't stand her.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.200
She found our postulants lacking in

20:52.200 --> 20:55.000
the humility of their
sub-continent counterparts.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.120
I never had her down as a lush,

20:57.120 --> 21:01.120
but it explains those wretched pear
drops she was for ever sucking on.

21:01.120 --> 21:04.400
Now we know. It was to mask
the alcohol on her breath.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.000
There's enough unseemly
tittle-tattle flying

21:07.000 --> 21:08.800
around without us
adding to it.

21:09.840 --> 21:13.680
And before Calcutta.
Where was Sister Paul?

21:19.800 --> 21:21.400
Haven't a clue.

21:32.520 --> 21:33.680
Who's there?

21:37.760 --> 21:39.400
Sister Boniface?

21:41.400 --> 21:43.160
Father Brown?

21:43.160 --> 21:45.480
What are you doing here?

21:45.480 --> 21:48.800
Same as you, I shouldn't wonder.
Have you found anything?

21:54.560 --> 21:58.960
Sister Paul liked things spit spot.
Military precision.

21:58.960 --> 22:03.360
Rather. Except here.

22:03.360 --> 22:07.320
Something's out of kilter.

22:07.320 --> 22:15.400
This is the shrine at Lourdes.
I'd know it anywhere. But look.

22:15.400 --> 22:20.720
St Bridget's, Gloucester.
Christmas, 1940.

22:20.720 --> 22:22.840
What can this mean?

22:22.840 --> 22:25.320
The killer is trying to
cover their tracks.

22:45.280 --> 22:49.640
Sadly more and more parishioners are
requiring your discrete services.

22:49.640 --> 22:52.600
I blame the war. Not least
for the Americans.

22:52.600 --> 22:55.600
Their so called youth culture
and Devil's music.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.840
None of that here, I assure you.

22:57.840 --> 23:01.000
A programme of hard physical labour,

23:01.000 --> 23:04.800
combined with reflection
and repentance.

23:13.560 --> 23:17.360
I expect Mrs McCarthy gave you
the news from St Agnes?

23:17.360 --> 23:22.120
Sister Paul was Warden here for
nine years. A fine woman.

23:22.120 --> 23:24.640
Warden. Of course.

23:26.120 --> 23:28.920
The Mothers nurse them
for six weeks.

23:28.920 --> 23:33.200
Then the infants are removed to good
Catholic families,

23:33.200 --> 23:37.480
and the girls released
back into society. Purged.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.760
Free from the stain of sin.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.280
Our Lady was a single mother once.

23:43.280 --> 23:48.200
Which is why God sent Saint Joseph
to make an honest woman of her.

23:48.200 --> 23:51.520
These girls have no hope
of divine intervention.

23:57.640 --> 24:00.320
I hope you're impressed
with what you've seen?

24:01.800 --> 24:03.600
I can't lie to you, Warden.

24:04.760 --> 24:08.200
I have yet to see a ship more
tightly run than this.

24:10.360 --> 24:13.440
Thank you, Father.

24:13.440 --> 24:15.360
If you would like to wait in there.

24:54.240 --> 24:58.320
What are you doing? I told you not
to get involved! Stay out of it.

24:58.320 --> 25:01.720
I said to stay in the cottage.
Now go!

25:30.120 --> 25:34.560
Skates on Sister. Late for vespers!

25:58.520 --> 26:01.520
Forgive me Lord.
I'm only borrowing it.

26:01.520 --> 26:05.680
Oh, I'm sorry to have
kept you, Father.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.560
Here's a familiar face.

26:13.840 --> 26:20.040
Call on me at his
earliest opportunity.

26:23.120 --> 26:25.240
Why aren't you at vespers?

26:26.440 --> 26:30.600
I lost my rosary, Reverend Mother.

26:30.600 --> 26:35.760
I think I might have it dropped
yesterday when I was here...

26:35.760 --> 26:40.280
..with the police. Bingo.

26:41.560 --> 26:44.280
Be sure to give thanks
to St Anthony.

27:30.920 --> 27:33.400
I thought that might be you.

27:33.400 --> 27:36.520
I heard what Susie had planned
for your dinner,

27:36.520 --> 27:40.520
and well, I took the precaution.

27:41.560 --> 27:45.240
Angel and saint rolled
into one Mrs M.

27:45.240 --> 27:48.600
And how did you find
St Bridget's, Father?

27:48.600 --> 27:50.200
Truth be told, unsettling.

27:53.520 --> 27:57.600
Word is, Sister Thomas Aquinas
provides a fine service.

27:57.600 --> 28:01.240
The separation of mothers and
their children defies nature.

28:01.240 --> 28:05.240
Surely better if society found
ways of keeping them together.

28:05.240 --> 28:10.120
Nonsense, Father. Those girls
are moral degenerates.

28:10.120 --> 28:13.240
Unsuitable to bring up
good Catholic children.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.920
I think it's going to be
a long night, Father.

28:18.920 --> 28:22.520
Perhaps Joyce was right,
she misses her mother.

28:22.520 --> 28:26.080
And Sister Boniface
telephoned with a message.

28:26.080 --> 28:31.960
Sometimes I feel like the telephone
exchange than the Parish Secretary.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.880
Now Father, have you room there
for another dumpling?

28:34.880 --> 28:38.920
What man could resist
your dumplings, Mrs M?

28:42.480 --> 28:45.160
The message. Was it important?

28:45.160 --> 28:49.360
Oh, too mysterious to relay
over the telephone.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.360
She wants you to call in on her.

28:51.360 --> 28:54.400
Tonight?
At your earliest convenience.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.560
Ah. Nothing urgent then.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.360
Hello? Who's there?

29:53.800 --> 29:56.200
Hello?

30:04.000 --> 30:06.600
A cart of black darning wool
for Sister Cyril,

30:06.600 --> 30:09.800
oh, and her usual denture cream.

30:11.240 --> 30:14.640
Morning all.
Father. Morning, Father.

30:14.640 --> 30:17.280
Sister Luke wants two bars
of Lifebuoy soap.

30:17.280 --> 30:20.360
But only if they're on special offer.

30:20.360 --> 30:23.360
Joyce Evans is indisposed,
so I volunteered

30:23.360 --> 30:25.360
to collect the Sisters' shopping.

30:26.400 --> 30:30.960
And, erm, that's the lot, Mr Boot.
Right you are, Mrs M.

30:30.960 --> 30:35.600
Sister Paul won't be needing her
usual pear drops. God rest her soul.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.960
And all on the St Agnes account.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.720
I'll see you anon.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.800
I'll see you at
choir practice I hope?

30:43.800 --> 30:47.120
Yes, at..? Four?

30:47.120 --> 30:52.120
Four. Splendid. You can count
on my presence.

30:52.120 --> 30:53.720
Father.

30:53.720 --> 30:56.640
Turf please...

30:58.080 --> 31:01.240
..and a quarter of pear drops.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.560
Off you go! Any luck?

31:09.560 --> 31:13.000
No, sir. Well, get back in,
and look again. Yes, sir.

31:13.000 --> 31:18.040
I can't find him anywhere, sir.
Inspector!

31:18.040 --> 31:21.560
Will no-one rid me of this
turbulent priest?

31:21.560 --> 31:25.400
And don't take me literally.
Sir?

31:25.400 --> 31:28.440
Never mind.
Something happened?

31:28.440 --> 31:31.360
Sister Boniface was
attacked last night.

31:31.360 --> 31:32.960
Tell me she's not dead.

31:32.960 --> 31:35.960
Voluble as ever.
She see her attacker?

31:35.960 --> 31:39.080
No, but I'm keen to speak to the
gardener when he turns up.

31:39.080 --> 31:41.960
Tom? Turns out our man has
a criminal record.

31:41.960 --> 31:45.240
Three counts of soliciting.
It doesn't make him a murderer.

31:45.240 --> 31:47.520
It makes him quite the ladies man.

31:47.520 --> 31:50.200
Surrounded by temptation
in a place like this.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.880
That's quite a leap, Inspector.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.400
You have a pure heart
Father. Unlike me.

31:58.680 --> 32:02.320
If Sister Mary Magdalene confessed
the affair to Sister Paul

32:02.320 --> 32:04.880
Tom would lose his job
and his livelihood.

32:04.880 --> 32:07.920
More than a motive for
double murder, don't you think?

32:07.920 --> 32:10.800
Unless of course you
know something I don't?

32:10.800 --> 32:13.920
One in particular, who has hidden
her heinous character,

32:13.920 --> 32:17.080
and concealed transgressions
of so serious a nature

32:17.080 --> 32:21.000
that I can only assume the
diocese has no knowledge of them.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.360
It ends there. And
the photograph's gone.

32:24.360 --> 32:27.640
I asked Sister Abelard to
check and it's vanished.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.400
Someone from Sister Paul's past

32:29.400 --> 32:32.040
clearly didn't want to
be recognised.

32:32.040 --> 32:36.920
Sister Paul. All paths
lead to Sister Paul.

32:36.920 --> 32:39.680
But what of Sister
Mary Magdalene?

32:39.680 --> 32:43.240
Pure and unworldly. On
the cusp of holy union.

32:43.240 --> 32:45.280
In a state
of spiritual grace.

32:45.280 --> 32:48.120
In Sister Paul's office, five
minutes before she died.

32:48.120 --> 32:51.640
Are you sure? According to Sister
Luke, Sister Mary Magdalene

32:51.640 --> 32:54.720
took a funny turn before
the service. Low blood sugar.

32:54.720 --> 32:58.320
Known fainter at mass. Anyway,
Sister Luke didn't want her keeling

32:58.320 --> 33:01.320
over at the altar,
so sent her off for a sit down.

33:01.320 --> 33:04.520
And guess whose office is
right next to the chapel?

33:04.520 --> 33:07.000
Surely it must be connected?

33:09.080 --> 33:13.600
Of course. That poor innocent girl.

33:14.920 --> 33:20.440
You know something, don't you?
Of course you do.

33:20.440 --> 33:22.160
I must go.

33:25.320 --> 33:27.760
Good luck.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.600
Ah, Father Brown.

33:34.600 --> 33:38.680
It's good to have your reassuring
presence back with us.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.680
Apologies for yesterday's absence.

33:40.680 --> 33:43.840
Business in Gloucester.
At St Bridget's.

33:43.840 --> 33:47.320
I hear it has an
excellent reputation.

33:47.320 --> 33:48.920
Surely you'd know so.

33:50.160 --> 33:53.560
As you yourself were there,
when Sister Paul was Warden.

33:56.160 --> 33:59.760
I didn't deny it.
You lied by omission.

33:59.760 --> 34:02.120
The question is - why a
woman of your integrity

34:02.120 --> 34:05.120
would do such a thing?
You don't have to explain yourself.

34:05.120 --> 34:08.800
With all due respect, Father,
you are not the police.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.000
No, but I believe the
key to these murders

34:11.000 --> 34:13.639
lies within the walls
of St Bridget's.

34:13.639 --> 34:17.719
If you're concealing anything,
I urge you to reveal it now.

34:20.560 --> 34:24.400
I lied to hide my sin.
The worst sin of all.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.520
No! I'm an adulteress.

34:28.239 --> 34:32.159
I betrayed our Lord
with a mortal man.

34:32.159 --> 34:34.280
Years ago. A moment of madness.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.880
He was a doctor at St Bridget's.

34:36.880 --> 34:42.560
He brought me no happiness.
Only grief and immeasurable loss.

34:42.560 --> 34:45.520
You confessed your sin
and made atonement.

34:47.000 --> 34:52.080
Yes, in their mercy both God
and my superiors in the order

34:52.080 --> 34:56.000
welcomed me back to the fold.
Then Sister Paul arrived.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.560
All holier than thou
and righteous spirituality.

34:58.560 --> 35:00.320
Threatening to destroy you.

35:00.320 --> 35:01.720
Someone had to stop her.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.720
You killed her?

35:04.720 --> 35:08.520
No! Although I was tempted.
Horrible woman.

35:10.360 --> 35:12.680
God rest her soul.

35:14.080 --> 35:17.040
You stole the letter
she wrote to the Bishop?

35:18.480 --> 35:20.040
I'm not ashamed.

35:20.040 --> 35:23.720
You're five times the
woman she would ever be.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.920
You shouldn't have done
that. My sin is not yours.

35:26.920 --> 35:28.280
I'm sorry.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.600
No, actually, I'm not.

35:31.600 --> 35:35.680
I couldn't stand by and watch her
ruin you and St Agnes with it.

35:35.680 --> 35:37.760
I'm not worthy of your loyalty.

35:37.760 --> 35:41.120
Fiddlesticks. You're the best
Reverend Mother we've ever had.

35:41.120 --> 35:42.760
Don't you agree, Father?

36:07.240 --> 36:10.000
The police are looking for you, Tom.
Why?

36:10.000 --> 36:13.600
Sister Boniface was attacked
last night. I wasn't here.

36:13.600 --> 36:14.800
Where were you?

36:14.800 --> 36:18.240
None of your business. I'm not
answerable to you or your God.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
He was with a woman.
Be quiet.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.520
She gives him what I don't.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.960
So you couldn't have attacked
Sister Boniface.

36:29.960 --> 36:31.360
I haven't attacked anyone,

36:31.360 --> 36:33.920
and before you ask,
I didn't kill anyone neither.

36:33.920 --> 36:36.240
I believe you.

36:36.240 --> 36:39.200
I see a man trying to
protect his wife.

36:39.200 --> 36:40.680
I never go to the convent.

36:40.680 --> 36:45.760
No, but you do the Sisters'
shopping in the village.

36:47.240 --> 36:49.480
Rather dusty, I'm afraid.

36:50.720 --> 36:53.640
I liberated them from
Sister Paul's horde.

36:53.640 --> 36:57.200
I'm sure she wouldn't have
wanted them to go to waste.

36:57.200 --> 37:00.560
And I am rather partial to
a pear drop.

37:00.560 --> 37:02.800
What game is this! Red or yellow?

37:05.200 --> 37:09.080
See I don't think it really matters.
I think they both taste the same.

37:09.080 --> 37:11.400
No!

37:13.040 --> 37:14.080
Yes.

37:16.080 --> 37:18.160
Are you trying to give
her a heart attack?

37:18.160 --> 37:21.000
Coming here with your fancy
theories and silly tricks.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
What I couldn't comprehend,
was why Sister Mary Magdalene?

37:24.000 --> 37:26.640
She wasn't the intended victim.
Don't listen to him.

37:26.640 --> 37:29.080
It was a recent arrival.
Someone from your past.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.200
Someone from St Bridget's.

37:31.200 --> 37:34.520
Never heard of it.
You're lying.

37:42.480 --> 37:46.400
"Male baby in good health.

37:46.400 --> 37:51.320
"Mother, J Purvis. 19 years old.

37:52.320 --> 37:56.960
"Five foot six. Brown hair.
Blue eyes.

37:58.120 --> 37:59.760
"Birth complications.

37:59.760 --> 38:01.640
"Postpartum cardiomyopathy."

38:01.640 --> 38:05.040
He had a name. Our son had a name.

38:05.040 --> 38:07.280
Must have made you very angry.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.560
Is that why you killed Sister Paul?

38:10.560 --> 38:14.440
No! Yes.

38:14.440 --> 38:19.520
All those chemicals lying round the
winery. An accident in waiting.

38:19.520 --> 38:22.200
All it needed was a helping hand.

38:23.480 --> 38:27.920
A life for a life.
You must miss him very much.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.720
He's here. I've seen him.

38:38.200 --> 38:41.400
Oh, dear. I had every
intention of returning that.

38:41.400 --> 38:42.960
Now where's your proof?

38:42.960 --> 38:45.560
I don't wish to prove anything.

38:45.560 --> 38:49.320
I want you to confess your sin
and receive God's forgiveness.

38:49.320 --> 38:54.680
My sin. He didn't know.
You told him what you'd done?

38:54.680 --> 38:57.920
And you tried to protect her by
removing the poisoned sweets

38:57.920 --> 39:01.320
from Sister Paul's body, and
planting the cyanide in her office.

39:01.320 --> 39:03.840
I suppose that's where
you saw the photograph.

39:03.840 --> 39:07.560
I'd like to see you prove it.
There's no escaping God's justice.

39:07.560 --> 39:11.080
I abandoned your God when
he abandoned me and mine.

39:11.080 --> 39:13.920
But your wife hasn't abandoned him.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.840
Don't say another word!

39:15.840 --> 39:17.200
Thomas Evans, I'd like you

39:17.200 --> 39:19.680
to accompany me to the
station for questioning.

39:19.680 --> 39:22.720
Starting with a full account of
your whereabouts last night.

39:22.720 --> 39:23.800
I was gone all night,

39:23.800 --> 39:26.920
and I've got an alibi to prove it.
Save it for the station.

39:26.920 --> 39:29.040
Please, Father. My wife.

39:35.400 --> 39:38.720
Blessed peace, at last.

39:41.560 --> 39:43.360
Sweet Jesus!

39:43.360 --> 39:46.880
Abigail! Abigail!

39:46.880 --> 39:51.000
Father, she's gone. I left
her for five minutes,

39:51.000 --> 39:52.560
just to take the shopping in

39:52.560 --> 39:55.040
and when I've come out,
she's disappeared.

39:55.040 --> 39:57.840
Oh, holy God, who would want
to take a baby?

39:57.840 --> 40:01.000
Don't panic, Mrs McCarthy.
Listen.

40:05.640 --> 40:10.040
Bless the Lord, Mrs McCarthy. He
gave her those lungs for a reason!

40:13.440 --> 40:18.280
Shush. You're all right. I'm here
now...get away from me!

40:18.280 --> 40:23.160
You give that baby back right now!
I won't let you take him!

40:23.160 --> 40:26.080
I'll die first.
I swear I'll kill us both!

40:29.440 --> 40:34.520
That's not your baby, Joyce.
Your baby was born at St Bridget's.

40:34.520 --> 40:37.480
Sinners and harlots, pray for us.

40:38.720 --> 40:44.480
You were frightened. And very alone.
What happened to your child, Joyce?

40:47.120 --> 40:52.720
Now sign it. My child has
a Father. Thomas Evans.

40:52.720 --> 40:55.840
He's a Private in the Glosters.
He's a prisoner of war,

40:55.840 --> 40:59.360
who didn't see fit to make an honest
woman of you before having his way.

40:59.360 --> 41:02.200
I have a right to...
You have no rights.

41:03.360 --> 41:06.120
Forfeited when you succumbed
to evil lust

41:06.120 --> 41:09.840
and contravened the laws of
God and society. Now sign it.

41:09.840 --> 41:11.320
Evil bitch.

41:11.320 --> 41:13.400
I'll die before
I sign away my child!

41:15.360 --> 41:17.480
You gave birth to a boy.

41:17.480 --> 41:19.360
His name is Daniel.

41:19.360 --> 41:23.720
Joyce, what happened to your child?

41:23.720 --> 41:25.160
She stole him.

41:27.120 --> 41:33.520
Please, No! Please, No! Please, No!
Get her.

41:35.640 --> 41:37.720
No!

41:41.840 --> 41:43.880
Calm down.

41:45.520 --> 41:50.240
Where are you taking me? No!

41:50.240 --> 41:53.840
She locked me up with lunatics.

41:53.840 --> 41:57.320
For my own good. A moral degenerate.

41:58.960 --> 42:00.840
I'm so very, very, very sorry.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.920
I wanted to wait till
we were married,

42:02.920 --> 42:06.600
but he went on and on the night
before he went to war.

42:06.600 --> 42:10.400
Said he needed something to remember
in case he didn't come back.

42:10.400 --> 42:13.440
He did come back for you.

42:13.440 --> 42:17.520
He made me an honest woman,
but I couldn't be a wife...

42:17.520 --> 42:19.280
..stand his touch.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.840
He looks just like him.

42:27.400 --> 42:29.680
I'm not sorry I killed her.

42:29.680 --> 42:32.240
Sweet baby Jesus.
Now she's the murderer!

42:32.240 --> 42:37.280
She stole my baby.
A life for a life.

42:37.280 --> 42:39.360
A life for two lives.

42:39.360 --> 42:43.440
Sister Mary Magdalene
was someone's child too.

42:43.440 --> 42:46.360
She was faint from low
blood sugar.

42:46.360 --> 42:49.800
Sister Paul was the
intended victim all along.

42:49.800 --> 42:52.080
For that I deserve to burn.

42:53.080 --> 42:55.720
Will I go to hell, Father?

42:55.720 --> 42:58.440
I wouldn't be worrying
about just that now!

42:58.440 --> 43:00.880
Certainly not. God is
forgiving and loving.

43:00.880 --> 43:02.120
He won't stop crying!

43:03.560 --> 43:07.400
She's crying because she wants
her mother, Joyce.

43:07.400 --> 43:13.000
Give her back. There've
been too many lost children.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.040
This isn't my baby.

43:23.320 --> 43:25.880
Forgive me.

43:37.800 --> 43:38.840
Poor soul.

43:38.840 --> 43:42.360
She paid a terrible price
for one act of love.

43:42.360 --> 43:44.040
As did I.

43:45.760 --> 43:50.320
I ask only that you'll allow me
to inform the Bishop myself.

43:50.320 --> 43:53.000
I ask only that you'll do
no such thing.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.360
St Agnes' convent has
been through enough

43:55.360 --> 43:58.280
without losing the
rock that is its foundation.

44:01.120 --> 44:02.160
Excuse me.

44:06.520 --> 44:07.760
What will happen?

44:08.880 --> 44:12.440
We're charging him as an
accessory. As for his wife,

44:12.440 --> 44:14.480
that's out of my jurisdiction.

44:22.200 --> 44:24.120
You cannot blame yourself.

44:33.120 --> 44:35.440
I thought murder was exciting.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.640
In reality, a tragic
and sordid business.

44:41.840 --> 44:47.160
Nothing at all like one of
Miss Christie's novels.

44:52.440 --> 44:57.600
Father. At least he isn't any worse
the wear for his experience.

44:57.600 --> 45:00.280
Quite the lungs on him.

45:00.280 --> 45:04.080
It's a...never mind.

45:14.680 --> 45:20.280
Abigail Mary, I baptise thee in
the name of the Father,

45:21.480 --> 45:23.360
the Son...

45:26.400 --> 45:29.000
..and the Holy Spirit.

45:36.160 --> 45:39.120
Amen. Amen.

45:40.305 --> 45:46.175
