YOUNG ARTHUR: Someday,

00:36.119 --> 00:39.407
this village will be
the great kingdom of Camelot.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.954
And I will be king.

00:41.416 --> 00:44.123
(CHUCKLES) You have some
very strange dreams.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.042
But they're not just dreams.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.164
Come on.

00:52.678 --> 00:54.168
Can I trust you with a secret?

00:55.347 --> 00:56.382
This tree...

00:56.473 --> 00:58.634
A man is trapped inside it.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.933
A great sorcerer, known as Merlin.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.556
He spoke to me one night.

01:03.647 --> 01:05.353
He gave me a prophecy.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.431
Told me I would
pull a sword from a stone

01:07.526 --> 01:09.687
and become King of Camelot.

01:09.778 --> 01:10.984
King Arthur?

01:11.029 --> 01:12.018
Yes.

01:12.114 --> 01:13.979
And you will be Queen Guinevere.

01:14.658 --> 01:18.992
And on all your birthdays,

01:20.038 --> 01:21.244
A Middlemist?

01:23.125 --> 01:24.205

01:24.293 --> 01:25.829
There's more where that came from.

01:25.919 --> 01:26.954
I'll show you.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.082
YOUNG GUINEVERE: Arthur?
Is that the sword in the stone?

01:33.844 --> 01:36.460
It's not. We should leave.

01:36.555 --> 01:39.342
Go on, King Arthur. Pull the sword.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.344
Leave him alone, Kay!

01:41.435 --> 01:43.926
His mother must've dropped him
on his head before she took off,

01:44.021 --> 01:46.307
and now he thinks
he's the Orphan King.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.972
YOUNG KAY: They call Camelot
"The Broken Kingdom"

01:49.067 --> 01:50.898
because we have no king,
and we never will.

01:51.528 --> 01:55.862
And nobody in Camelot is ever gonna
kneel to the boy who cleans the stables.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.407
YOUNG KAY: Come on. Let's go.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.832
Maybe he's right.

02:07.919 --> 02:08.954
YOUNG GUINEVERE: No, he's not.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.336
And you will find that sword.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.590
All you have to do now

02:16.470 --> 02:18.426
is follow your heart.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.566
Where's the rest of it?

02:37.658 --> 02:39.569
SIR PERCIVAL: How will you take
the throne with half the sword?

02:39.660 --> 02:41.992
What will you tell the people?

02:43.664 --> 02:44.653
(HORSE NEIGHS)

02:48.210 --> 02:51.202
SIR PERCIVAL: All hail, King Arthur!

02:55.842 --> 02:59.130
Camelot is no longer
the Broken Kingdom.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.511
I give you Excalibur.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.427
The sword pulled from the stone!

Something's wrong. Tell me.

03:40.137 --> 03:42.549
Myjourney wasn't all I'd hoped for.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.221
ARTHUR: Merlin speaks in half truths.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.059
And now my quest has only just begun.

(OPENING THEME PLAYING)

04:12.210 --> 04:13.746
You wanted to see me?

04:13.837 --> 04:16.419
Yes. Yes, we have
something serious to discuss.

04:16.506 --> 04:17.712
Please, join me.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.173
Now that you're a member
of the Round Table,

04:20.218 --> 04:22.755
it's time to share
Camelot's greatest secret.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.508
The sword that made me king is broken.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.764
ARTHUR: For years,
I've hunted its missing piece.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.392
Something known as
the dagger of the Dark One.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.727
(SWORD CLlNKlNG)

04:38.528 --> 04:39.734
I've heard tales of it.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.070
Well, I think you're the man
to help me find it.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.565
After all, you're the only one
who needs it as bad as l.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.364
ARTHUR: You're desperate to
destroy the power of the Dark One.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.869
Only Merlin can do that.

04:49.956 --> 04:50.945
ARTH U R: Perhaps.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.372
Perhaps not.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.583
No one knows what Merlin really wants,

04:55.712 --> 04:58.875
but with that dagger,
we wouldn't need Merlin.

05:00.091 --> 05:03.049
I could re-forge Excalibur
into the sword it once was,

05:03.136 --> 05:05.923
with the power to destroy the darkness
once and for all.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.216

A sweet sound.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.406
A strange sound.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.450

it's coming from.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.306
Your dagger.

I say finders keepers.

That's nothing for you.

Shatter it.

06:04.948 --> 06:05.937
I can't.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.445
It's calling to its other half.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.776
Leave me alone.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.365
Your friends cannot protect you.

(WHISPERING) David,
where have you been?

07:04.132 --> 07:05.338
I was looking
all over the castle for you.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.258
(WHISPERING) With Arthur. It turns out,
he might have a way to help Emma.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.881
-We can't...
-If we give him the dagger...

07:10.013 --> 07:12.379
David, listen to me.
We can't trust Arthur.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.016
What are you talking about?
Who told you that?

07:15.226 --> 07:16.352
Lancelot.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.180
Lancelot?

07:18.271 --> 07:19.511
Lancelot is dead.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.850

07:24.361 --> 07:27.444
Given the state that she's in,
anything could set her off.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.861
She needs rest.

07:29.616 --> 07:33.108
Somewhere quiet and away
from prying eyes.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.864
I know the perfect place.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.071
Perhaps me and the boy
should take her there.

Come on, love. Let's sail away.

07:47.801 --> 07:48.790
(DOOR CLOSES)

07:50.053 --> 07:54.046
Whatever's happening to her,
I think she was here for the dagger.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.556
So I should probably
move it somewhere safer.

07:56.685 --> 07:57.720
Now, hold on a second.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.558
Arthur has a way to use that,
to help Emma.

07:59.604 --> 08:02.437
What did Ijust tell you?
We are not giving it to Arthur.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.066
Lancelot said he can't be trusted!

08:04.109 --> 08:06.896
And Cora said Lancelot was dead.
You can't believe everything you hear.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.768
You really don't trust Lancelot, do you?

08:08.905 --> 08:10.270
He married us. He's our friend!

08:10.407 --> 08:12.693
That was a long time ago.
And where's he been all these years?

08:12.742 --> 08:14.243
-He didn't say.
-We|l, where is he now?

08:14.369 --> 08:15.905
Hiding. It's not like
he's welcome in Camelot.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.785
Because he went after Arthur's wife.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.575
And he's back. Why? Why's he back?

08:19.624 --> 08:21.785
I don't know, David!
I don't have all the answers!

08:24.587 --> 08:26.543
Regina, would you mind
please giving us a minute?

08:31.386 --> 08:33.968
Listen, Arthur
is already looking for the dagger.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.213
If we come clean now,
he can still help us.

08:36.266 --> 08:37.802
So that's what this is about.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.141
You haven't met a king in a while,
and you're star-struck.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.555
That's not what this is about.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.765
Our daughter is sick,
we have to help her!

08:43.815 --> 08:44.930
So why become
a Knight of the Round Table?

08:45.066 --> 08:46.101
How does that help her?

08:46.234 --> 08:49.567
Or is it that
you need to feel like a hero again?

08:51.281 --> 08:53.272
Maybe the Round Table's
exactly where I should be.

08:54.784 --> 08:58.276

come to the party, dance with your wife.

No. No, no, I can't. I can't.

Don't you understand?
This is Merlin's test.

09:56.513 --> 09:59.129
Why else would he lead me to this?

13:36.691 --> 13:38.556
That is a relief.

13:38.693 --> 13:40.854
My wife thought this was a bad idea.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.734
What put her off me?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.323
It's the beard, isn't it?

13:45.074 --> 13:47.565
Something a bit more serious.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.158
Lancelot.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.072
He's back.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.377
LANCELOT: You must
not think much of me.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.755
And what would I tell Arthur
if his Queen ran off on my watch?

14:09.891 --> 14:12.257
Tell him I'm going to
find the dagger myself.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.431
I broke into Merlin's tower and took this.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.895
A magic Gauntlet.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.852
And it has shown me
the true location of the dagger.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.069
Arthur has it all wrong.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.523
And how did Arthur not find
this remarkable magic object,

14:24.614 --> 14:26.104
in all his years of looking?

14:26.240 --> 14:27.696
He would never think to use it

14:27.784 --> 14:31.197
because he believes
the dagger will be his strength.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.447
And this Gauntlet,

14:33.456 --> 14:35.447
it leads you to
a person's greatest weakness.

14:36.084 --> 14:38.791
So I'm going to finish
this damned quest,

14:38.878 --> 14:41.039
and get back the man I love.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.461
And you cannot stop me.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.084
LANCELOT: Stop you?

14:45.635 --> 14:46.795
I'mjoining you.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.432
GUINEVERE: (EXHALES)
I told you it would work.

14:55.478 --> 14:56.558
This is it.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.887
The Vault of the Dark One.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.312
GUINEVERE: These symbols.

15:00.400 --> 15:04.109
They are the same ones Arthur
showed me on that damn scroll of his.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.485
Star.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.316
(VIBRATES)

15:10.159 --> 15:11.148
Eye.

15:12.495 --> 15:13.575
Sun.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.166
(BUBBLING)

15:44.152 --> 15:45.517
Shall we?

15:53.494 --> 15:54.779
This way.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.313
(WHOOSHING)

16:33.409 --> 16:34.489
Lancelot!

16:43.961 --> 16:45.576
(LANCELOT SCREAMS)

16:45.630 --> 16:46.915
No.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.462
You cannot have him!

16:58.893 --> 17:00.099
Lancelot.

17:01.896 --> 17:02.885
(GASPS)

17:03.606 --> 17:05.437
I thought you were dead.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.356
I was sure I'd lost you.

17:17.495 --> 17:18.575
I'm sorry.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.288
That will never happen again.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.171
No.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.967
Never.

17:40.351 --> 17:42.763
We need to remember why we're here.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.765
For our King.

17:48.693 --> 17:49.978
For Arthur.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.316
Lancelot's alive.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.570
And here in Camelot.

17:58.661 --> 17:59.992
Serious news, indeed.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.444
Can we keep this between ourselves?

18:01.539 --> 18:02.528
Of course.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.284
Sometimes a husband
has to go on the defensive.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.081
I wouldn't want my wife
to learn that he's here.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.578
She already has.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.249
Where is Lancelot?

18:11.340 --> 18:12.455
He doesn't know, my love.

18:12.550 --> 18:17.010
So tell me how to find him,
so I can make him pay for what he did.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.838
From what I heard,
you both had some culpability in that.

18:20.016 --> 18:22.382
(SCOFFS) So you heard the old story?

18:22.476 --> 18:25.843
Believe me,
the legend is only the beginning.

18:25.938 --> 18:29.180
Lancelot coveted far more
than a kiss from a Queen.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.891
Yes, I'm afraid my wife is right.

18:31.986 --> 18:34.477
I didn't want to
speak ill of a former knight.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.108
A former friend.

18:36.198 --> 18:39.065
But if Lancelot is in Camelot,
that dagger isn't safe anywhere.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.533
Then it's a good thing

18:42.496 --> 18:44.236
I brought it with me.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.336
ARTHUR: Where is it?

19:11.275 --> 19:12.936
You can come out. It's me.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.610
Turns out, I need your help.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.536
There's something we must hide.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.207
(PANTING)

19:38.469 --> 19:41.552
Come on, Mom. Keep going.
We're almost there.

19:42.556 --> 19:43.545
(DOOR OPENS)

19:44.058 --> 19:45.047
(HORSE NEIGHS)

19:45.142 --> 19:47.178
HENRY: It's nice here, right?

19:47.269 --> 19:49.726
A good place to rest.
You'll feel better in no time.

19:49.814 --> 19:52.055
It's a quiet and isolated little nook.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.935
How did you turn up such a refuge, lad?

19:54.694 --> 19:56.980
Well, there's this girl.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.862
Is there, indeed?

20:00.491 --> 20:01.731
Well, I like this tale already.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.362
It's not like that.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.443
Her name is Violet.
And she brought me here.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.699
The stable belongs to her family.

20:07.790 --> 20:08.996
So you two are getting close?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.867
(STAMMERING) Not at all.
We're just hanging out.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.577
VIOLET: Hello? Who's in there?

20:14.672 --> 20:17.129
(WHISPERING) That's her! Hide. Hide.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.251
Go on.

20:19.176 --> 20:20.586
Go on.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.376
(DOOR OPENS)

20:24.640 --> 20:25.629
(CHUCKLES)

20:25.725 --> 20:27.966
Henry. What are you doing here?

20:28.060 --> 20:32.599
I was wondering if you'd be interested
in taking me riding.

20:33.691 --> 20:34.897
Yeah. I'd love to.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.145
Come on,
I'll introduce you to Nicodemus.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.225
That your dad?

20:38.320 --> 20:39.981
(CHUCKLES) No. It's my horse.

20:40.197 --> 20:41.528
(BIRDS TWEETING)

20:41.991 --> 20:43.652
Hope you're ready to
get your heart racing.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.443
(LAUGHS) Come on.

20:47.538 --> 20:48.527
(DOOR CLOSES)

20:50.416 --> 20:52.498
Well, you can hide buried treasure

20:52.585 --> 20:54.075
or a winning poker hand,

20:54.170 --> 20:56.536
but you can't hide
the bloom of first love.

20:56.630 --> 20:57.665
Yes, he has a crush.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.123
And he straight-up lied to my face,
and I'm the Dark One.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.208
-You're his mother.
-Which is scarier?

21:02.303 --> 21:04.544
To him? That's up for debate.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.593
Speaking of your Dark One-ness,

21:08.684 --> 21:12.051
don't you think it's time
you tell me the truth of what happened?

21:16.734 --> 21:17.849
It's Rumplestiltskin.

21:19.570 --> 21:22.312
Or at least something
that looks like him.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.650
I've been seeing him in my head
ever since we got here.

21:27.411 --> 21:30.369
He was there when we first found you.
With the flame-haired Scot.

21:30.456 --> 21:32.993
I almost crushed her heart
because of this voice.

21:41.884 --> 21:45.752
I've spent many years
battling demons in my head.

21:45.888 --> 21:48.755
And I was able to purge them
on the prow of the Jolly Roger,

21:48.849 --> 21:51.056
riding the ocean's waves.

21:52.603 --> 21:54.969
Too bad you can't have it
shrunk in your pocket right now.

21:56.190 --> 21:57.851
Well, we may not need it.

21:57.942 --> 22:01.935
That girl promised to get
Henry's heart racing astride a horse.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.444
You and I are gonna do the same.

22:11.705 --> 22:14.082
You never told me what happened
between you and Guinevere.

22:15.876 --> 22:16.956
It's complicated.

22:17.044 --> 22:19.035
But what's happened is in the past.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.586
It doesn't matter anymore.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.631
It does if you still love her.

22:28.556 --> 22:29.796
Yes.

22:30.975 --> 22:33.136
I'll forever love Guinevere.

22:38.649 --> 22:40.685
The dagger lies beyond this door.

22:41.277 --> 22:42.517
Stand back.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.603
We have no idea what trap remains.

22:59.336 --> 23:00.325
(DOOR CLOSES)

23:00.671 --> 23:02.002
GUINEVERE: There it is.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.626
Excalibur will finally be complete!

23:12.308 --> 23:13.673
(BOTH GRUNTING)

23:14.476 --> 23:15.465
(GROANS)

23:15.644 --> 23:17.760
Not exactly a sword in a stone,

23:17.855 --> 23:19.720
but it still does the trick.

23:19.815 --> 23:20.804
(GIGGLES)

23:22.860 --> 23:25.602
So that's how you found this place.

23:25.696 --> 23:27.982
Merlin's Gauntlet.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.813
That's quite a powerful object.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.900
At least for a wizard stuck in a tree.

23:31.994 --> 23:36.158
That dagger is Arthur's birthright.
And you will surrender it to us.

23:36.248 --> 23:39.365
So that's King Arthur's weakness, is it?

23:44.590 --> 23:47.172
Sadly, I can't give you what you want.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.126
Though I might be willing to part
with the next best thing,

23:50.220 --> 23:53.712
assuming, of course, you're willing to
make a deal for that Gauntlet.

23:53.807 --> 23:56.264
What's the next best thing
to completing a magical sword?

23:56.352 --> 23:59.640
Making it appear
like it's been completed.

23:59.730 --> 24:01.140
With this...

24:02.399 --> 24:07.314
Enchanted sand
from the mystical isle of Avalon.

24:08.989 --> 24:12.481
One pinch of this can "fix" anything.

24:12.576 --> 24:13.816
Even Excalibur?

24:14.536 --> 24:16.618
Your husband need never know.

24:16.705 --> 24:21.119
After all, what's one little secret
if it means getting your husband back?

24:21.210 --> 24:23.075
Assuming, of course,

24:24.088 --> 24:25.453
that's still what you want.

24:28.676 --> 24:30.462
And why should I trust you?

24:30.552 --> 24:32.338
Because I know what happens

24:32.429 --> 24:36.422
when a woman's heart
is torn between duty and desire.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.302
And believe me,

24:39.561 --> 24:41.301
it never ends well.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.140
Please, Guinevere,

24:47.111 --> 24:49.102
don't listen to this demon.

24:55.744 --> 24:57.530
-I will accept your deal.
-(RUMPLESTILTSKIN GIGGLES)

24:57.997 --> 24:59.237
Good girl.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.571
But be careful.

25:00.666 --> 25:02.873
Love is a weapon, dearie.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.201
The most dangerous weapon of all.

25:05.295 --> 25:07.081
Which means the pain
you should worry about

25:07.172 --> 25:09.504
isn't the kind inflicted by
a broken sword,

25:10.634 --> 25:12.420
but the kind that comes

25:13.637 --> 25:15.844
from a broken heart.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.061
We're here.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.813
SNOW WHITE: The Vault
of the Dark One.

25:35.909 --> 25:36.944
(VAULT OPENING)

25:48.422 --> 25:49.628
This place.

25:50.591 --> 25:51.922
I've been here before.

25:55.012 --> 25:58.800
I had a vision, I thought
I understood what it meant,

25:58.891 --> 26:00.631
but maybe I was wrong.

26:01.727 --> 26:04.434
Maybe it was always
about Emma becoming the Dark One.

26:04.521 --> 26:05.636
LANCELOT: What did you see?

26:06.523 --> 26:07.512
(GASPS)

26:07.941 --> 26:08.930
(GASPS)

26:10.986 --> 26:12.271
Emma crushed my heart.

26:13.447 --> 26:14.482
We have no time to waste.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.234
We have to make sure
that Arthur can't get this dagger.

26:16.325 --> 26:17.906
This altar is the place to secure it.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.154
But it's shielded by
a nasty protection spell.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.869
Well, if it's meant to
keep the dagger safe,

26:22.956 --> 26:25.117
then maybe a person holding it
can be allowed past.

26:25.209 --> 26:26.449
Wait.

26:27.544 --> 26:28.579
It should be me.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.048
You've done enough.

26:33.467 --> 26:35.378
You need to let me do this, Snow.

26:37.763 --> 26:40.550
What is it? Don't you trust me?

26:43.602 --> 26:45.012
ARTH U R: Apparently not.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.685
That's a decision she's gonna regret.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.262
-Arthur!
-I wouldn't.

26:49.399 --> 26:52.482
Excalibur's blade is broken,
this one works just fine.

26:52.569 --> 26:55.561
You followed us. So I was right.

26:55.656 --> 26:58.022
Pity your husband didn't listen
when you tried to warn him.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.277
Where's he?

26:59.368 --> 27:00.528
Searching for you.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.860
In the wrong place.

27:03.497 --> 27:05.237
Which means if you
ever want to see him again,

27:07.626 --> 27:10.083
you're gonna hand over that dagger.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.519
ARTHUR: Hello, Guinevere.

27:35.863 --> 27:37.228
Where were you?

27:38.240 --> 27:42.233
Lancelot and I went to
find the dagger of the Dark One.

27:43.412 --> 27:45.118
And tell me, were you able to find it?

27:45.205 --> 27:46.490
Yes.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.077
It was where you said it would be.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.908
In the Dark One Vault.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.413
You mean to say you truly found it?

27:54.464 --> 27:57.171
Well, where is it, then?
Give me the dagger!

27:58.510 --> 27:59.886
Finally...

27:59.970 --> 28:02.803
-|'|| finally prove Merlin wrong.
-(CLATTERING)

28:02.890 --> 28:04.005
That I'm not a fool.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.260
That I'm meant
to be king of this godforsaken place.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.466
It's not here!

28:07.561 --> 28:10.098
Where are you
hiding the dagger from me?

28:12.482 --> 28:14.222
The only thing I'm hiding

28:15.110 --> 28:16.190
is this.

28:17.237 --> 28:20.024
I couldn't get the dagger,
so I got this instead.

28:20.115 --> 28:25.235
Enchanted sand that can make
something broken appear whole again.

28:25.329 --> 28:29.493
Well, that's why you came back.
To use magic to trick me!

28:29.583 --> 28:32.245
Yes! I wanted you back!

28:32.336 --> 28:34.952
To be the man I loved. My King.

28:36.381 --> 28:39.623
But now I've realized
I don't want any of it.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.218
Not unless it's real.

28:44.848 --> 28:48.306
It can be. You can have me back.
You can have it all.

28:48.393 --> 28:52.306
I just need the dagger.
Tell me where the Vault is!

28:52.397 --> 28:55.355
Don't you understand?
You have to make a choice!

28:55.442 --> 28:57.899
Stop trying to mend that sword,

28:57.986 --> 29:01.820
or your marriage and your kingdom

29:01.907 --> 29:03.522
will be broken forever.

29:07.955 --> 29:09.411
And what if I can't?

29:16.255 --> 29:17.711
Then I'll follow my heart

29:18.924 --> 29:20.505
to where it belongs.

29:21.843 --> 29:23.049
With Lancelot.

29:24.429 --> 29:25.544
I saw you.

29:25.639 --> 29:27.595
It's not what you think.

29:27.683 --> 29:30.265
He was saying goodbye.
He's leaving Camelot.

29:30.352 --> 29:31.933
You expect me to believe that?

29:32.854 --> 29:34.765
I can't lose you to him, Guinevere.

29:35.732 --> 29:36.721
I won't.

29:36.817 --> 29:38.478
I'll do whatever it takes to fix things.

29:38.568 --> 29:39.648
Arthur, what are you doing?

29:39.736 --> 29:40.851
I'm sorry, Guinevere.

29:40.946 --> 29:44.154
But my heart tells me
I have to finish my quest.

29:44.241 --> 29:47.904
And with this magic,
I can keep you by my side to do it.

29:47.995 --> 29:49.360
No.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.503
So, my Queen,

30:05.846 --> 30:06.961
how are you now?

30:09.433 --> 30:11.594
Better, I think.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.518
Middlemist flowers.

30:19.443 --> 30:20.728
So beautiful.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.606
Do you remember
the first time I gave one to you?

30:23.697 --> 30:24.982
Of course.

30:25.574 --> 30:28.156
It was the day
you told me about Merlin's prophecy.

30:29.536 --> 30:31.948
A prophecy you have yet to complete,

30:33.165 --> 30:35.998
and I have not been supportive enough.

30:36.084 --> 30:38.951
I know how much
getting that dagger means to you.

30:39.046 --> 30:41.412
So you can prove yourself to Merlin.

30:42.716 --> 30:44.126
Yes, my Queen.

30:45.886 --> 30:49.424
But until then, I don't see why you
can't live in the kingdom you deserve.

30:50.223 --> 30:52.555
And I think it's time to
fix this broken kingdom.

30:53.393 --> 30:54.508
Don't you?

31:40.315 --> 31:41.816
Give me the dagger.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.391
Or I will put this sword
through my oldest friend,

31:44.486 --> 31:46.727
-Iike I should've done years ago.
-No!

31:46.822 --> 31:48.733
First you try and steal my wife,

31:48.824 --> 31:50.985
and now you wanna deny me
the dagger after all I've done for it?

31:51.076 --> 31:52.111
Please don't hurt him!

31:55.705 --> 31:56.740
Here.

32:02.712 --> 32:05.419
I have waited a lifetime for this.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.423
Now I control your daughter.

32:10.762 --> 32:13.879
I can command her to
reunite the sword and free Merlin.

32:15.225 --> 32:17.432
Excalibur's blade will be
the last thing he sees

32:17.519 --> 32:19.635
before I use it to run him through.

32:20.147 --> 32:23.435
Then I will use the blade to
snuff out the darkness once and for all.

32:24.568 --> 32:26.559
I can become
what no one thought I could.

32:26.653 --> 32:28.689
The greatest king in all of the realms.

32:30.615 --> 32:33.982
Dark One! I command you to appear!

32:38.874 --> 32:40.865
I say, I command you!

32:40.959 --> 32:42.574
She's not coming.

32:43.879 --> 32:44.994
Why, what have you done
to the dagger?

32:46.214 --> 32:48.546
The dagger's not real.

32:49.134 --> 32:51.466
How? How?

32:52.053 --> 32:53.634
You knew he would follow us.

32:53.722 --> 32:55.053
DAVID: She wasn't the only one.

32:56.391 --> 32:58.302
I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

32:58.393 --> 33:02.136
Well, I had to keep my distance
so Arthur wouldn't see me trailing him.

33:02.230 --> 33:03.561
You betrayed me.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.560
You broke the sacred trust of
the Round Table.

33:06.651 --> 33:09.563
You tried to trick me
with a catchy title and a comfy chair.

33:09.696 --> 33:11.027
David, you deserved a seat at my table.

33:11.072 --> 33:13.905
Every choice I've made
is for the good of Camelot.

33:14.034 --> 33:15.820
I'm trying to destroy the darkness!

33:15.911 --> 33:17.651
The darkness is in my daughter!

33:18.872 --> 33:22.535
So every choice I make
is for the good of my family.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.040
So this was all a show?

33:25.003 --> 33:26.083
Were you even really fighting?

33:26.213 --> 33:27.828
-The fight was real.
-Very real.

33:27.923 --> 33:32.383
But we quickly realized that fighting
wasn't going to solve any problems.

33:33.261 --> 33:38.096
So we put aside our differences
and thought of Emma's wellbeing first.

33:42.103 --> 33:46.187
Beautiful animal, isn't she?
The finest horse in all of Camelot.

33:46.274 --> 33:50.563
Or, at least, the finest I could borrow
without anyone noticing.

33:50.612 --> 33:54.525
I thought the plan was to ride the horse.
This feels a lot like walking.

33:54.616 --> 33:56.777
This isn't like driving
that yellow contraption of yours.

33:56.910 --> 33:59.743
You can'tjust turn a key.
The horse has to trust you.

34:00.914 --> 34:03.530
So, go on. Introduce yourself.

34:22.602 --> 34:23.637
Go away.

34:24.437 --> 34:25.722
HOOK: Swan.

34:26.314 --> 34:29.147
Stop talking to the demon in your head.
Get on the horse.

34:29.234 --> 34:31.395
This is pointless. I'm the Dark One.
What's this going to do?

34:31.486 --> 34:32.817
This isn't about
the bloody horse, Emma.

34:32.946 --> 34:35.232
This is about
you putting your faith in me.

34:36.449 --> 34:37.484
In our future.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.571
You still think
we can get back there to Storybrooke

34:40.662 --> 34:42.653
and some white picket fence life?

34:42.747 --> 34:46.160
Yes. I'll never stop fighting for us.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.991
All you have to do is trust me.

34:49.129 --> 34:50.665
This will work.

35:21.036 --> 35:23.869
Finally, a blade that can stand up
to Granny's meatloaf.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.195
So now what do we do with it?

35:25.290 --> 35:29.704
Well, Arthur wanted to reunite it
with the dagger and use it for evil.

35:29.794 --> 35:32.536
But that doesn't mean
that it couldn't also be used for good.

35:32.672 --> 35:33.832
Like helping Emma.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.172
We can talk more about it
as soon as we get back to Camelot

35:36.217 --> 35:38.003
and put someone worthy in charge.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.669
I spent a lifetime
putting my faith in a false king.

35:42.057 --> 35:46.175
Camelot's true leader
is its Queen, Guinevere.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.897
Is it me, or is he unusually quiet?

35:54.027 --> 35:55.016

36:26.059 --> 36:27.094
I love him.

36:29.896 --> 36:32.854
No. It's not real.

36:32.941 --> 36:35.557
He must've used
the Sands of Avalon on you.

36:37.529 --> 36:40.942
Guinevere, we can break this spell.

36:41.074 --> 36:42.439
Not interested.

36:46.121 --> 36:48.737
Take this traitor to the dungeon,
where he belongs.

wrong, then your secret's out.

Never.

Actually, I'm quite optimistic.

That's the cell the rats take a fancy to.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.936
I had a disagreement with the King.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.990
Didn't make me a lot of friends.

38:10.872 --> 38:12.828
It might've made you one.

38:15.502 --> 38:18.539
Because an enemy of King Arthur
is probably a friend of mine.

I'm sure David and Mary Margaret
are fine.

You think I'm worried about them?

38:36.856 --> 38:38.562
Those two can outlive a cockroach.

I want to know how their test went.

I get antsy when I don't know
who I should hate.

Turns out, David was right.
We can trust Arthur.

Locked safely in the dungeon.
He was lying.

is to give Arthur the real dagger.
