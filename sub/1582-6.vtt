02:54.370 --> 02:57.505
Oh, the rain has washed away
the playground shed!

02:57.539 --> 02:59.907
I'm being chased by sports!

02:59.942 --> 03:02.977
It's called "precipitation,"
'cause it never fails

03:03.012 --> 03:04.512
to precipitate unruly behavior.

03:06.382 --> 03:09.017
And saddest of all,
those who do not have a friend

03:09.051 --> 03:10.418
to play with in the rain,

03:10.452 --> 03:13.821
doomed to get
only single pneumonia.

03:19.028 --> 03:20.428
A spit wad?

03:20.462 --> 03:23.064
Well, at least
I'm getting some attention.

03:24.733 --> 03:26.367
And the best part is
I'm bombarding her

03:26.402 --> 03:27.368
with her own homework.

03:41.216 --> 03:42.917
Begone!

03:46.288 --> 03:49.023
Well, you're never alone
surrounded by...

03:49.058 --> 03:51.526
<i>The Autobiography</i>
<i>of Charles Manson?</i>

03:55.397 --> 03:56.397
Hmm.

03:58.233 --> 04:00.802
Huh?

04:00.836 --> 04:02.537
Hi. New kid, second grade.

04:02.571 --> 04:03.671
Don't you love the rain?

04:03.706 --> 04:05.139
New kid?

04:05.174 --> 04:07.108
Uh, have you made
any friends?

04:07.142 --> 04:08.576
Just Charlotte,.

04:08.610 --> 04:11.446
That's a reference
to the Bronte sisters!

04:11.480 --> 04:13.948
You got my reference
to the Bronte sisters?!

04:13.982 --> 04:15.550
Nice to meet you,
Lisa Simpson.

04:15.584 --> 04:17.584
How do you know my name?

04:17.619 --> 04:19.420
I deciphered the anagrams
on your notebook.

04:19.454 --> 04:20.755
Oh.

04:20.789 --> 04:22.557
Be Lisa?

04:25.894 --> 04:27.261
Isabel!

04:30.632 --> 04:32.066
Ooh, spaghetti.

04:36.839 --> 04:38.339
Y'ello!

04:38.374 --> 04:41.242
Lisa, you got a call
from someone named Isabel.

04:42.544 --> 04:44.746
May I ask
what this is regarding?

04:44.780 --> 04:47.849
Ooh! A budding new friendship?
Oh!

04:47.883 --> 04:50.084
Boy, how come you can't
get a new friend?

04:50.119 --> 04:51.586
What's wrong with the one I got?

04:51.620 --> 04:54.355
I finally got that M&M
out of my inner ear.

04:54.390 --> 04:57.792
I remembered correctly;
it <i>was</i> a green one!

04:57.826 --> 05:00.128
<i>Don't eat it.</i>
<i>It's been in his ear.</i>

05:00.162 --> 05:02.130
<i>Don't eat it.It's been</i>
<i>in his ear.</i>

05:05.334 --> 05:08.903
<i>Don't eat it. It's been in the</i>
<i>boy's ear and the dog's mouth.</i>

05:08.937 --> 05:10.805
<i>Don't eat it.</i>

05:10.839 --> 05:13.775
Oh, for God's sake!

05:13.809 --> 05:16.344
And don't you hate being
the middle child?

05:16.378 --> 05:19.380
Yeah. In the car, I always
have to sit on the hump.

05:19.415 --> 05:20.681
It makes reading impossible.

05:20.716 --> 05:23.418
Lisa, your
food's getting cold!

05:23.452 --> 05:25.920
It's raw veggies.
They're supposed to be cold!

05:25.954 --> 05:29.056
Well, someone who loves you
put melted butter on them!

05:29.091 --> 05:30.558
Thank you,
Mr. Bergstrom.

05:30.592 --> 05:32.527
I'll tell Lisa
you dropped by.

05:32.561 --> 05:33.428
I better go.

05:33.462 --> 05:35.296
Okay, but one more thing:

05:35.330 --> 05:36.931
I noticed we're both
doing presentations

05:36.965 --> 05:39.500
on Franklin Roosevelt at school.
Why don't we do them together?

05:39.535 --> 05:43.438
Oh, my God.
Someone wants to be my partner.

05:43.472 --> 05:45.473
Can't screw this up.

05:45.507 --> 05:48.176
Downloading, downloading,
downloading,

05:48.210 --> 05:49.377
downloading, downloading...

05:51.947 --> 05:53.080
Whoo-hoo!

05:55.918 --> 05:58.252
Franklin Roosevelt
bravely instituted

05:58.287 --> 06:00.988
a series of reforms
called the New Deal.

06:01.023 --> 06:02.423
Which ran totally counter

06:02.458 --> 06:04.826
to America's tradition
of limited government.

06:04.860 --> 06:07.128
P.S. It was also
unconstitutional.

06:07.162 --> 06:08.629
Oh?

06:08.664 --> 06:11.799
Um, FDR's steadfast leadership

06:11.834 --> 06:14.368
also helped America
win World War Two.

06:14.403 --> 06:17.238
Until the weak-kneed Democrats
sold us out at Yalta.

06:17.272 --> 06:19.874
If you haven't guessed, Lisa,
I'm a Republican.

06:19.908 --> 06:21.275
A Lincoln Republican?

06:21.310 --> 06:22.043
Not really.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.244
A Reagan Republican?

06:23.278 --> 06:24.245
Keep going.

06:24.279 --> 06:25.246
First President Bush?

06:25.280 --> 06:26.481
Getting there.
Oh, dear God.

06:31.502 --> 06:33.737
I must say, Lisa,

06:33.771 --> 06:36.306
it <i>was</i> amusing to see you
thoroughly de-high-horsed.

06:36.341 --> 06:38.308
That isn't a word.

06:38.343 --> 06:40.777
Ooh, back on the saddle
she climbs.

06:40.812 --> 06:42.579
I just can't believe
someone like you

06:42.613 --> 06:43.814
would be a Republican.

06:43.848 --> 06:46.350
I mean, isn't your
last name Gutiérrez?

06:46.384 --> 06:48.318
Just what exactly
are you saying?

06:48.353 --> 06:50.687
I'm just saying that
people of your heritage--

06:50.722 --> 06:53.256
which could be any one
of many heritages,

06:53.291 --> 06:54.992
I'm not pigeonholing...

06:55.827 --> 06:57.494
Is it a Catholic thing?

06:57.528 --> 06:59.563
I'm a non-observant Jew
from Argentina.

06:59.597 --> 07:00.564
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

07:00.598 --> 07:02.165
Do you even know
what that means?

07:02.200 --> 07:04.468
Uh, there-there's
a <i>caramba</i> in my eye?

07:04.502 --> 07:06.670
It's the Spanish version
of "hot damn."

07:06.704 --> 07:08.171
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

07:08.206 --> 07:11.641
Hmm? Lisa, is
everything okay?

07:11.676 --> 07:13.443
Yes. Why?

07:13.478 --> 07:14.811
Because you're doing
your homework

07:14.846 --> 07:16.179
and you don't
look happy.

07:16.214 --> 07:19.216
My new best friend
isn't what I thought.

07:19.250 --> 07:21.385
She's a... Republican!

07:23.087 --> 07:24.321
What is so funny?

07:24.355 --> 07:25.622
They're destroying
the world!

07:25.656 --> 07:26.890
They are, huh?

07:26.924 --> 07:28.492
I thought I'd
show you this

07:28.526 --> 07:29.926
when you were
older, but...

07:29.961 --> 07:32.396
You voted for Reagan?!

07:32.430 --> 07:35.365
It was a crazy
time, the '80s.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.268
You don't hear me listening
to the Thompson Twins anymore.

07:38.302 --> 07:40.404

07:48.713 --> 07:51.148

Mm-hmm.

07:52.316 --> 07:54.885
All right, '80s party!
Where's the beef?

07:54.919 --> 07:56.286
Tear down that wall!

07:56.320 --> 08:00.023
Because I think the beef
is behind that wall!

08:00.058 --> 08:02.426

Bobby Kennedy worked
for Joe McCarthy.

08:41.099 --> 08:42.866
Larry David was on <i>Fridays.</i>

08:42.900 --> 08:44.267
What are you trying to say?

08:44.302 --> 08:47.003
Isabel's only eight.
As she grows up,

08:47.038 --> 08:49.773
surprising things will
happen to her body...

08:49.807 --> 08:50.907
of beliefs.

08:50.942 --> 08:53.276
But she could always use
a friend like you.

08:53.311 --> 08:54.311
Hmm.

08:55.279 --> 08:57.414
Hmm.

08:57.448 --> 08:59.850
Isabel?
Lisa?

08:59.884 --> 09:01.485
Listen, I'm really
sorry about...

09:01.519 --> 09:02.786
No, it's okay.

09:02.820 --> 09:05.088
My mom says you're just
going through a liberal phase.

09:05.123 --> 09:08.592
What?! My mom says you're going
through a conservative phase.

09:08.626 --> 09:09.693
There's no such thing.

09:09.727 --> 09:11.161
Conservatives only get
more conservative.

09:11.195 --> 09:12.395
Because every year,

09:12.430 --> 09:14.364
they get a little further
through <i>Atlas Shrugged.</i>

09:14.398 --> 09:16.700
Listen, we're both
eight years old.

09:16.734 --> 09:18.768
Can't we just play
Monopoly or something?

09:18.803 --> 09:20.904
My father owns
a monopoly!

09:29.413 --> 09:32.582
That young filly is exactly
the kind of candidate

09:32.617 --> 09:34.684
we need to start
recruiting!

09:34.719 --> 09:37.888
She's a young,
dynamic <i>Latina.</i>

09:37.922 --> 09:41.291
Yee-haw!
I said that just right!

09:41.325 --> 09:45.228
Without the Hispanic vote, even
Texas is poised to turn blue.

09:45.263 --> 09:46.329
Blue!

09:46.364 --> 09:49.299
Yeah, we must reach her
and groom her

09:49.333 --> 09:51.501
before she fattens up
like Chris Christie.

09:51.536 --> 09:54.604
He thinks GOP
stands for "Gravy on Pancakes."

09:56.140 --> 10:00.977
But despite my mirthful remarks,
obesity is no laughing matter.

10:06.502 --> 10:10.539
Just can't resist
those words, "sign-up sheet."

10:10.573 --> 10:13.708
Oh, looks like I'll be
running against Isabel.

10:13.743 --> 10:14.943
And Ralph?

10:14.977 --> 10:16.945
Just call me
Ralph Nader.

10:16.979 --> 10:18.947
I don't know why.
Isabel!

10:18.981 --> 10:21.183
I want this campaign
to be about the issues:

10:21.217 --> 10:22.617
same-sex field trip buddies,

10:22.652 --> 10:25.220
providing class pets
with a path to citizenship...

10:25.254 --> 10:27.088
And no digging up
past relationships.

10:27.123 --> 10:30.058
Sure, Lisa and I dated.
Sure, she broke my heart.

10:30.092 --> 10:32.227
I'm sure your researchers
know all about it.

10:32.261 --> 10:34.196
This is the first
I've heard of it.

10:34.230 --> 10:35.797
Really?
But I got this!

10:35.832 --> 10:37.599
Ew.

10:37.633 --> 10:40.168
How long has it been since
you washed your stomach?

10:40.203 --> 10:41.803
You can't ask that anymore!

10:43.406 --> 10:44.539
Quit shoving!

10:44.574 --> 10:46.475
I'd like a word
with you, young lady.

10:46.509 --> 10:47.609
How did you get in there?

10:47.643 --> 10:48.944
Slid in through
the grates.

10:50.646 --> 10:52.314
Here's the scoop.

10:52.348 --> 10:53.515
You're our future,

10:53.549 --> 10:55.250
so we can't afford
to have you lose.

10:55.284 --> 10:56.718
And I love the Spanish--

10:56.752 --> 10:59.588
from the Inquisition
to the delightful Franco years.

10:59.622 --> 11:01.289
What are you talking about?

11:01.324 --> 11:03.625
Move over!
I know how to talk to kids.

11:03.659 --> 11:06.061
We want to give you
a little present.

11:06.095 --> 11:09.598
A tainted victory
that will haunt you forever.

11:09.632 --> 11:12.300
I'd rather
do this myself.

11:12.335 --> 11:14.202
But who'd own you then?

11:14.237 --> 11:17.205
You couldn't buy me with
a wheelbarrow full of ice cream.

11:20.576 --> 11:22.143
Whoa, nicely done.

11:22.178 --> 11:24.779
You've charmed another one
right into the arms

11:24.814 --> 11:26.581
of the Libertarian Party.

11:26.616 --> 11:29.484
Maybe we can help her without
her knowing we're helping her.

11:29.519 --> 11:32.888
No one says I can't buy
a second grade election.

11:32.922 --> 11:35.357
Why, I had enough money to fix
<i>People Magazine's</i>

11:35.391 --> 11:37.292
Sexiest Man Alive.

11:37.326 --> 11:38.994
Most of the money
went to convincing them

11:39.028 --> 11:40.428
that I was alive.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.833
Who ordered
the Yumboni?

11:44.867 --> 11:46.034
Right here!

11:46.068 --> 11:47.936
Now, Smithers,
I want you to eat this for me.

11:47.970 --> 11:49.170
Describe every taste.

11:49.205 --> 11:51.172
And don't forget
the brain freeze.

11:51.207 --> 11:53.275
Sir, I am lactose-intolerant.

11:53.309 --> 11:54.476
And I'm back-talk-allergic!

11:54.510 --> 11:55.677
So start eating!

11:58.147 --> 11:59.948
Have a great day, kids.

11:59.982 --> 12:01.816
And, Bart, I'll pick you up
after school

12:01.851 --> 12:03.552
to take you to karate lessons.

12:03.586 --> 12:05.520
Mom, after six weeks,
I figured out

12:05.555 --> 12:08.023
that Sensei Weinstein
is really my psychiatrist.

12:08.057 --> 12:11.893
Either way, for 45 minutes,
you're not my problem, sweetie.

12:15.431 --> 12:17.599
Don't worry, Lisa,
despite the paid ad,

12:17.633 --> 12:19.901
I am strictly middle
of the road.

12:19.936 --> 12:21.336
Idiot!

12:21.370 --> 12:22.370
Pick a lane!

12:23.573 --> 12:25.373
Wha...?!

12:29.745 --> 12:31.746
What are you doing?!

12:31.781 --> 12:33.348
I'm as bewildered
as you are.

12:33.382 --> 12:35.350
I don't know why, but the
Springfield Republican Party

12:35.384 --> 12:36.551
is grooming me.

12:36.586 --> 12:39.054
Grooming? Yuck!

12:39.088 --> 12:41.089
Unfortunately,
I can't stop it.

12:41.123 --> 12:43.792
The Supreme Court says
spending money is free speech.

12:43.826 --> 12:45.627
Well, then you could use
your free speech

12:45.661 --> 12:48.663
to denounce this intrusion
of big money into our election.

12:48.698 --> 12:49.931
Mm, I'll think about it

12:49.966 --> 12:52.200
while I'm on my listening tour
of the cafeteria.

12:59.241 --> 13:01.176
Pour me another.

13:01.210 --> 13:02.744
What are you doing?

13:02.778 --> 13:04.212
It's imaginary.

13:05.414 --> 13:06.514
Fine.

13:06.549 --> 13:07.716
I got to go.

13:07.750 --> 13:10.719
I'll see you later.

13:25.434 --> 13:27.035
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

13:27.069 --> 13:29.404
Bart, I need you to help me
win the election.

13:29.438 --> 13:31.406
I can help, but it's
gonna get rough.

13:31.440 --> 13:32.440
I'm fine with rough.

13:32.475 --> 13:34.009
You don't know what rough is.

13:34.043 --> 13:35.176
That ain't rough.

13:35.211 --> 13:36.945
More like a gentle breeze.

13:36.979 --> 13:38.279
Maggie hits harder.

13:38.314 --> 13:41.650
Did the good night pixie
just kiss my cheek?

13:41.684 --> 13:42.651
Ow!

13:42.685 --> 13:44.152
Okay, you got my attention.

13:44.186 --> 13:45.587
You want to win this election?

13:45.621 --> 13:47.989
Then from now on,
you do exactly what I say.

13:48.024 --> 13:49.124
You got it.

13:49.158 --> 13:50.792
First, go make me
five pans of brownies.

13:50.826 --> 13:53.461
You're just taking advantage
of the situation.

13:53.496 --> 13:55.497
Hmm, maybe Isabel
likes baking.

13:55.531 --> 13:57.399
Cakey or gooey?

13:57.433 --> 13:59.634
I'll make both.

14:01.671 --> 14:03.238
First, we reel them in.

14:03.272 --> 14:05.607
Then, we scare
the hell out of them.

14:05.641 --> 14:07.709
By discussing the
school's budget crisis?

14:07.743 --> 14:10.111
No, with balls to the head.

14:10.146 --> 14:12.681
Bombardment!

14:16.052 --> 14:19.854
I associate Isabel
with a pain in my tummy.

14:21.323 --> 14:23.191
Bombardment?

14:24.727 --> 14:25.960
Miss Simpson,

14:25.995 --> 14:27.929
your platform calls
for the creation

14:27.963 --> 14:29.597
of a student-run garden.

14:29.632 --> 14:31.866
Organic gardening is
an essential part

14:31.901 --> 14:34.769
of 21st century education,
teaching both hands-on...

14:34.804 --> 14:36.438
And what programs
would you cut to pay

14:36.472 --> 14:38.106
for this precious garden
of yours?

14:38.140 --> 14:39.407
The new Wiffle bats?

14:39.442 --> 14:40.608
Pizza Friday?

14:40.643 --> 14:43.211
Not Pizza Friday!

14:43.245 --> 14:45.113
Sorry, Lisa, you lose again.

14:46.148 --> 14:48.817
You got to get
on your game, sister.

14:48.851 --> 14:49.918
You think I'm tough?

14:49.952 --> 14:52.420
Wait till Gutiérrez
sinks her teeth into you.

14:52.455 --> 14:54.222
Remember, you got
an ace in the hole:

14:54.256 --> 14:56.891
chocolate milk
in the water fountains.

14:56.926 --> 14:58.259
That's impossible.

14:58.294 --> 14:59.661
We've already had
the best plumbers

14:59.695 --> 15:01.329
in the city look into it.

15:01.363 --> 15:03.898
Hey, we'll worry about that
after you're elected.

15:06.602 --> 15:07.902
What are you
so happy about?

15:07.937 --> 15:09.270
It's in the bag, Lis.

15:09.305 --> 15:11.239
Once everybody sees this.

15:12.274 --> 15:13.374
Training wheels.

15:13.409 --> 15:15.310
She still uses
training wheels.

15:16.512 --> 15:17.746
And watch this.

15:22.618 --> 15:24.119
Excellent.

15:24.153 --> 15:25.620
What am I doing?

15:25.654 --> 15:27.355
Untent! Untent!

15:27.389 --> 15:31.259
Oh, Bart, I want to win,
but not like this.

15:31.293 --> 15:32.927
I'm sorry, you're fired.

15:36.365 --> 15:38.533
Leave the bottle.

15:38.567 --> 15:41.936
I bet by the end of the night,
you're gonna look pretty good.

15:41.971 --> 15:45.774
Welcome to our first
in a series of 37 debates--

15:45.808 --> 15:49.110
good Lord-- before the
elementary school elections.

15:49.145 --> 15:50.645
You're a booger head!

15:50.679 --> 15:53.414
And I say we move
beyond name-calling

15:53.449 --> 15:55.884
to solve our real problems.

15:57.253 --> 15:58.553
Booger head!

15:58.587 --> 16:00.021
Vote for whoever you want to.

16:00.055 --> 16:01.389
To me, these are both losers.

16:01.423 --> 16:05.360
Now, the second grade debate
between Isabel Gutiérrez

16:05.394 --> 16:07.796
and Lisa Simp-a-son.

16:07.830 --> 16:08.897
Sounds weird.

16:08.931 --> 16:10.565
Mm.

16:10.599 --> 16:11.900
<i>Ivy Agee,</i>

16:11.934 --> 16:14.068
Frank Marino, Glen Gloyd.

16:14.103 --> 16:16.805
These are men who fought
at Omaha Beach.

16:16.839 --> 16:18.239
And they are the reason

16:18.274 --> 16:20.408
I'm running
for second grade rep.

16:20.442 --> 16:22.577
<i>Dios los bendiga a todos.</i>

16:23.913 --> 16:26.948
I'll bet my bologna sandwich
that girl's gonna win.

16:26.982 --> 16:29.050
Oh, a little rich
for my blood, sir.

16:29.084 --> 16:30.752
Yes, you can fog
a mirror, Seymour,

16:30.786 --> 16:32.187
but I wouldn't
call you alive.

16:32.221 --> 16:35.123
Now, the other candidate,
Lisa Simpson.

16:35.157 --> 16:37.559
Okay, I'm a liberal.

16:37.593 --> 16:39.761
And sometimes
that's a dirty word.

16:40.796 --> 16:42.063
Liberal.

16:42.097 --> 16:45.099
But what liberal really means
is someone who believes

16:45.134 --> 16:46.901
that those who have
more than enough

16:46.936 --> 16:49.404
should share a little
with those who don't.

16:50.272 --> 16:51.506
And those principles

16:51.540 --> 16:53.441
have consistently been in place

16:53.475 --> 16:56.177
during this country's
most prosperous times.

16:56.212 --> 16:59.047
So if that's a liberal,
then I am a liberal.

16:59.081 --> 17:00.148
And hang me.

17:01.350 --> 17:03.117
Sorry, we're just setting up

17:03.152 --> 17:05.053
for <i>An Occurrence</i>
<i>at Owl Creek Bridge.</i>

17:14.156 --> 17:15.291
Ooh.

17:15.292 --> 17:17.194
The Democratic Party pantheon.

17:17.229 --> 17:19.130
Such lofty ideals.

17:20.198 --> 17:21.598
And here come the spirits.

17:21.633 --> 17:24.034
Michael Dukakis, Walter Mondale,

17:24.069 --> 17:25.336
John Kerry?

17:25.369 --> 17:27.003
These are all losers!

17:27.038 --> 17:30.107
I'm afraid you're heading
for a loss, Lisa.

17:30.142 --> 17:32.676
And when we lose, we lose big.

17:32.711 --> 17:33.944
What about Obama?

17:33.979 --> 17:35.045
Harry Truman?

17:35.080 --> 17:36.113
Bill Clinton?

17:36.148 --> 17:37.948
Lisa, you're a lot like me.

17:37.983 --> 17:39.984
Play the saxophone,
come from a small town,

17:40.018 --> 17:41.619
raised by a mother
with no help.

17:41.653 --> 17:43.454
So, do you know how I can win?

17:43.488 --> 17:45.289
I don't even know
why I'm a ghost.

17:45.323 --> 17:46.790
All these guys are alive.

17:46.825 --> 17:48.659
John Kerry here is
Secretary of State.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.227
Doing a bang-up job.

17:50.262 --> 17:51.962
Well, we still
have a long way

17:51.997 --> 17:53.931
to go on Asian
currency issues.

17:53.965 --> 17:55.499
Absolutely.

17:55.534 --> 17:57.214
And, Lisa, I'm only
appearing in this dream

17:57.235 --> 17:59.803
so I can visit with you about
the Clinton Global Initiative.

17:59.838 --> 18:02.573
See, our mission is
to turn ideas into action.

18:02.607 --> 18:04.186
And to find innovative
solutions that will hel...

18:04.743 --> 18:05.709
Hey, hey, hey!

18:05.744 --> 18:07.244
You can't fall asleep
in a dream!

18:09.981 --> 18:11.248
I know what I've got to do.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.385
Hello, Isabel? Listen...

18:17.322 --> 18:19.723
CGI also convenes
CGI America,

18:19.758 --> 18:23.360
a meeting devoted to economic
recovery and job creation.

18:23.395 --> 18:24.862
You used to be fun!

18:24.896 --> 18:26.530
Kevin Costner used
to be a movie star.

18:26.565 --> 18:27.565
Get over it.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.201
And now for their final debate,

18:30.235 --> 18:32.770
please welcome,
uh, Li... um...

18:32.804 --> 18:35.773
Li-sa? Li-sa, uh, Simpsone.

18:35.807 --> 18:37.541
Yes.

18:37.576 --> 18:41.378
And, uh, Isabel
Adolpho-Guzman-Lopez Gutiérrez.

18:41.413 --> 18:42.613
Uh, ladies.

18:48.820 --> 18:51.455
I just want to say,
I don't care about politics,

18:51.489 --> 18:54.291
electioneering
or negative campaigning.

18:54.326 --> 18:56.860
If my friend Lisa wins,
so be it.

18:59.798 --> 19:02.099
And I also want
to say that if...

19:02.133 --> 19:03.200
Time's up.
But I...

19:03.235 --> 19:04.535
Stop showboating.

19:07.639 --> 19:11.108
Back in the banner shed you go.

19:11.142 --> 19:12.443
<i>Good morning.</i>

19:12.477 --> 19:14.578
We have completed
the tally of the votes

19:14.613 --> 19:15.813
for class representative.

19:15.847 --> 19:17.815
One brief announcement:
the tainted Greek salad

19:17.849 --> 19:19.083
has given several students

19:19.117 --> 19:21.485
nightmares involving
Michael Dukakis.

19:21.519 --> 19:23.153
It may recur tonight,
so if possible,

19:23.188 --> 19:25.155
have your parents
strap you to the bed.

19:25.190 --> 19:26.757
And now the results.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.626
First grade rep--
results delayed indefinitely

19:28.660 --> 19:30.261
due to jelly on the ballots.

19:30.295 --> 19:31.262
Second grade rep--

19:31.296 --> 19:33.530
Isabel Gutiérrez.

19:33.565 --> 19:35.232
Third grade rep, no votes cast.
Congratulations, Isabel.

19:35.267 --> 19:37.268
Fourth grade rep-- last name
Weiner, first name Ima...

19:37.302 --> 19:39.136
I truly hope you enjoy the
Friday morning council meetings.

19:39.170 --> 19:40.437
Simpson!

19:40.472 --> 19:43.507
And the-the free
snicker doodle cookies.

19:43.541 --> 19:44.842
Smithers, we won!

19:44.876 --> 19:47.478
Drop the balloons!

19:47.512 --> 19:48.846
Ow! Ow! Ooh!

19:51.316 --> 19:53.317
Can I at least
remove the balloons?

19:53.351 --> 19:55.019
Do it and you'll kill him.

19:55.053 --> 19:56.954
Hey, Lis.

19:56.988 --> 19:57.955
Hey.

19:57.989 --> 19:59.189
I'm sorry I fired you.

19:59.224 --> 20:00.557
Eh, no hard feelings.

20:00.592 --> 20:02.459
A lot of good things have
been happening to me.

20:02.494 --> 20:03.460
Mm-hmm.

20:03.495 --> 20:04.728
Thanks, Bart.

20:04.763 --> 20:06.096
I think you might
feel better

20:06.131 --> 20:08.098
if you looked at
these exit polls.

20:08.133 --> 20:10.534
They find me
a pointy-haired know-it-all.

20:10.568 --> 20:13.470
Yes, but they agreed
with everything you said.

20:13.505 --> 20:14.805
What are you getting at?

20:14.839 --> 20:17.675
53% said they'd vote
for a liberal.

20:17.709 --> 20:19.109
Just not you.

20:19.144 --> 20:21.378
Huh. You hear that, world?

20:21.413 --> 20:24.448
They love my ideas,
just not me!

20:24.482 --> 20:26.850
And that is half the battle!

20:26.885 --> 20:28.319
Ha!

20:28.353 --> 20:30.521
Hello, I'm elder
Anderson Cooper.

20:30.555 --> 20:31.922
Welcome to our first debate

20:31.956 --> 20:33.657
between Republican
Isabel Gutiérrez

20:33.692 --> 20:35.926
and Lisa Simpson, representing

20:35.960 --> 20:38.529
the Democratic Robot
Zombie Coalition.

20:38.563 --> 20:40.898
First question:
Ms. Simpson, what would you do

20:40.932 --> 20:43.300
to get America
out of Afghanistan?

20:43.335 --> 20:46.637
I'd just throw in the towel
and make it a state.

20:46.671 --> 20:48.972
That's our girl.

20:50.408 --> 20:55.408
