00:06.548 --> 00:12.337
Good morning, children. I am
your new governess, Mrs Davenport.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.552
Too formal.

00:14.723 --> 00:19.432
Henry, Beatrice.
I am so glad to meet you.

00:21.210 --> 00:23.594
I've heard so much about you and...

00:23.774 --> 00:26.691
I'm sure we'll be very good friends.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.692
Too familiar.

00:32.616 --> 00:37.527
I'm Mrs Davenport. Your father has
asked me to be your new governess.

00:37.704 --> 00:40.492
Something he did
without mentioning it to us.

00:40.666 --> 00:44.794
Good morning, children.
It's good to see you.

00:45.754 --> 00:51.294
You must be Henry.
And this... is Beatrice.

00:54.847 --> 00:58.970
Henry Burleigh.
Viscount Timmins.

00:58.267 --> 01:03.225
My sister, the Lady Beatrice Flora.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.935
You will address us
as "my lord" and "my lady".

01:06.108 --> 01:09.109
Of course... my lord.

01:09.278 --> 01:14.782
Please, sit down. Let's get to know
one another, shall we?

01:16.201 --> 01:21.788
I'm Mrs Davenport. I hope to be a friend
to you as well as a governess.

01:21.957 --> 01:24.199
In ullam rem ne properemus.

01:24.376 --> 01:29.418
- I beg your pardon?
- In ullam rem ne properemus.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.796
Is your Latin a bit rusty?

01:33.927 --> 01:35.967
I suppose it is.

01:36.138 --> 01:39.471
Then I don't see how you'll be doing
my lessons with me.

01:42.269 --> 01:47.809
My lord, I assure you that I am more
than qualified to instruct you.

01:47.983 --> 01:50.604
I may have to brush up on my Latin,

01:50.777 --> 01:53.981
but when it comes to
mathematics and the sciences,

01:54.156 --> 01:57.240
I'm sure you'll find
my lessons challenging.

02:00.204 --> 02:04.367
And Beatrice... what
do you like to study?

02:05.626 --> 02:10.300
- Nothing.
- Not even painting or needlework?

02:11.600 --> 02:15.467
I just made my first sampler.
I finished it yesterday.

02:15.636 --> 02:22.540
- Did you? I'd love to see it sometime.
- I don't have it. I gave it to Mother.

02:22.226 --> 02:25.808
Beatrice! My sister is confused.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.731
She gave the sampler
to Mother before she died.

02:28.899 --> 02:32.813
- No, I didn't. I gave it to her last night.
- Beatrice!

02:32.986 --> 02:37.310
- I talked to her.
- Beatrice is upset, Mrs Davenport.

02:37.199 --> 02:39.690
She hasn't accepted
our mother's death.

02:41.912 --> 02:47.831
Beatrice... I know it was a terrible thing
to lose your mother.

02:48.100 --> 02:51.121
She's not dead. I saw her last night!

02:53.549 --> 02:55.588
What have you done
to my sister?

02:57.135 --> 03:00.421
Computer... restore characters
in program Janeway Lambda-1.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.637
Unable to comply.

03:02.808 --> 03:06.343
There's a power disruption
to energy grid Beta-4.

03:07.271 --> 03:11.814
- Janeway to bridge. Report.
- Power fluctuations on deck 6, Captain.

03:11.984 --> 03:16.444
- Mr Tuvok is investigating.
- Keep me informed. Janeway out.

03:22.369 --> 03:26.698
Tuvok to Lieutenant Torres. Has any
equipment repair been authorised?

03:26.874 --> 03:30.400
- Negative. What's going on?
- Standby.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.710
Be careful!

03:33.881 --> 03:36.454
Sorry.
You might have broken the connection.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.207
Crewman Dalby,
what are you doing here?

03:39.386 --> 03:42.910
One of the bio-neural gel packs
was malfunctioning.

03:42.264 --> 03:45.990
- I had to replace it.
- Did you inform Lieutenant Torres?

03:45.267 --> 03:47.592
No. I'm taking this to engineering
for analysis.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.770
We have a protocol
for such procedures.

03:50.939 --> 03:55.435
I was in the area and fixed it.
What's the problem?

03:55.611 --> 03:58.481
Your repair interrupted
a number of ship's functions.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.692
- That's the problem.
- I'm used to doing things differently.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.702
On our ship, when something
went wrong, you fixed it.

04:04.870 --> 04:08.155
I would remind you that
you are no longer on a Maquis ship.

04:08.332 --> 04:13.326
I'm well aware of that, Lieutenant.
And every day I regret it.

04:13.503 --> 04:16.707
I was just trying to do my job.
Trying to help out.

04:16.882 --> 04:20.166
If that goes against Starfleet's rules,
put me in the brig.

04:20.344 --> 04:23.298
Otherwise, leave me alone.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.074

06:14.917 --> 06:18.617
Captain's log, stardate 48846.5.

06:18.795 --> 06:22.330
Ordinarily, the loss of a gel pack
would be a minor inconvenience.

06:22.508 --> 06:26.588
But here it's a reminder
of the precarious nature of our journey.

06:27.638 --> 06:31.422
The gel packs have
an extremely reliable track record.

06:31.600 --> 06:35.183
They are almost impossible to damage.
Why did this one malfunction?

06:35.354 --> 06:39.398
Unknown. Lieutenant Torres
is running an analysis.

06:39.566 --> 06:43.184
- The unit has been replaced.
- How many are left in reserve?

06:43.362 --> 06:45.271
47.

06:45.447 --> 06:48.680
They run half the critical systems
on this ship.

06:48.242 --> 06:52.191
Once they run out, that's it.
We can't replicate new ones.

06:52.371 --> 06:56.783
It's possible to switch some systems
to conventional isolinear circuits.

06:56.959 --> 07:01.122
- Start looking into it.
- There is another matter to discuss.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.668
I am concerned about crewman Dalby.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.592
He made unauthorised
repairs to a damaged gel pack.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.883
When confronted, he lost control.

07:09.540 --> 07:10.762
How so?

07:10.931 --> 07:15.474
He became angry... to the point
of insubordination.

07:15.644 --> 07:20.306
Dalby. I've heard complaints about him.

07:20.482 --> 07:24.231
This is not the first incident
involving him.

07:24.403 --> 07:29.361
Last week he tampered with systems
to increase a friend's replicator rations.

07:29.533 --> 07:32.569
And he's missed three
of his last ten duty shifts.

07:32.744 --> 07:35.662
Commander, you know Mr Dalby well.

07:35.831 --> 07:39.449
What might be bothering him?

07:39.626 --> 07:45.297
Dalby's always been pretty aggressive.
My guess is, the man's frustrated.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.917
He's not used to dealing with Starfleet
protocol and procedure.

07:49.940 --> 07:51.846
A starship cannot run without protocols.

07:52.140 --> 07:54.552
His attitude is disrupting operations.

07:54.725 --> 07:58.888
What do you suggest? Dragging him
in front of a disciplinary board?

07:59.620 --> 08:03.190
- Perhaps that would be best.
- I doubt that's going to help.

08:03.358 --> 08:08.104
Dalby's not the only Maquis
who's having problems adjusting.

08:08.280 --> 08:14.484
Besides, it's not only a matter
of attitude, but also of experience.

08:14.661 --> 08:18.326
It's not fair to expect Starfleet behaviour
from those not in the Academy.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.700
What do you propose?

08:21.877 --> 08:25.440
We need to bring some of these people
up to speed.

08:25.214 --> 08:28.100
Instruct them in how to run
a Starfleet vessel.

08:28.175 --> 08:31.176
Show them why we do things
the way we do.

08:31.345 --> 08:34.179
Give them an opportunity
to feel part of the team.

08:34.347 --> 08:38.642
A crash course in Starfleet operations.
Field training.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.720
Exactly.

08:42.147 --> 08:46.690
What do you think, Mr Tuvok? Are you
up to training a group of raw cadets?

08:46.860 --> 08:47.856
Me?

08:48.280 --> 08:52.441
You taught at the Academy
for 16 years. You'd be perfect.

08:53.659 --> 08:57.280
Commander Chakotay
would be a more logical choice.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.825
He is a Maquis,
as well as their former captain.

08:59.998 --> 09:04.826
That's my point. He doesn't have to
earn their respect. We do.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.627
Very well, Captain.
I will prepare a curriculum.

09:11.552 --> 09:16.480
Commander, pick out the Maquis crew
members you feel would benefit most.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.140
Have them report to Lieutenant Tuvok
at the next duty shift.

09:19.309 --> 09:26.230
Right. Don't worry,
I'll tell them to take it easy on you.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.947
Good morning.

09:36.118 --> 09:40.696
We are here as the Captain
feels you'd benefit from training.

09:40.873 --> 09:43.198
- Consequently...
- I think we need clarification.

09:43.375 --> 09:46.246
Why have we been singled out
for this... honour?

09:46.420 --> 09:49.789
The answer
would seem to be self-evident.

09:49.965 --> 09:54.294
Interrupting a senior officer
is not acceptable behaviour.

09:54.469 --> 09:58.400
The purpose is to familiarise you
with Starfleet protocols.

09:58.182 --> 10:00.340
So that mistakes will be minimised.

10:00.517 --> 10:06.686
Still, the fact remains...
If I may have permission to speak...

10:08.108 --> 10:13.185
Thank you. You must have noticed
certain problems with each member

10:13.363 --> 10:15.439
of this select group
or we wouldn't be here.

10:15.616 --> 10:20.361
- I can't imagine why I'm included...
- Crewman Chell...

10:20.579 --> 10:25.122
Your report indicates that you are
talkative, disruptive and unreliable.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.830
You promise
to do tasks which then go undone.

10:28.300 --> 10:31.253
That is a complete exaggeration.

10:31.423 --> 10:33.748
Just yesterday,
I overhauled the servicing system...

10:33.926 --> 10:38.422
- You will speak only when spoken to.
- Lieutenant, I was just...

10:38.597 --> 10:41.349
40 laps around the cargo bay.

10:41.516 --> 10:44.304
- Start running now.
- But...

10:44.478 --> 10:46.305
50 laps!

10:52.277 --> 10:57.402
This class will adhere to standards
established for Starfleet cadets.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.982
There will be physical training
and academic studies.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.446
As well as tactical situations.

11:07.840 --> 11:10.749
Crewman,
have you been listening to me?

11:11.672 --> 11:15.621
- I did not hear that answer.
- Yes.

11:15.801 --> 11:18.256
Speak up, crewman.

11:18.428 --> 11:23.174
- I said, yes.
- Look at me when I'm talking to you.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.806
- Leave him alone.
- What was that?

11:25.978 --> 11:29.347
I said leave him alone.
Can't you see he's just a kid.

11:29.523 --> 11:32.358
- He shouldn't even be here.
- We think he should.

11:32.526 --> 11:36.654
You'll probably have me running
200 laps for this but I don't care.

11:36.822 --> 11:42.243
This whole thing is insulting.
We didn't ask to come aboard this ship.

11:42.411 --> 11:47.701
We've done our best and now you're
telling us that's not good enough.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.959
- That is correct.
- Well, maybe that's just too bad.

11:51.128 --> 11:54.793
Maybe we've done our best
and that's as good as you'll get.

11:54.965 --> 11:58.490
How about it?
Does anybody want to be here?

11:58.218 --> 12:02.430
- I don't have anything to learn.
- I don't think he's going to phaser us.

12:02.598 --> 12:05.349
I'd rather be in the brig than in here.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.557
So let's go.

12:08.770 --> 12:12.270
Crewmen, you are demonstrating
rank insubordination.

12:12.441 --> 12:16.225
- I order you to stay where you are.
- Chell!

12:17.905 --> 12:21.570
Come on! We're leaving.

12:34.338 --> 12:39.415
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
to leave like that.

12:39.593 --> 12:43.425
- They won't let us get away with it.
- What will they do?

12:43.597 --> 12:45.922
Keep us in the brig for 70 years?

12:46.990 --> 12:49.530
Everyone is needed.
Nothing will happen.

12:49.228 --> 12:53.225
It's not like we're guilty of mutiny.
We'll just keep doing our jobs.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.979
We're just not going to jump
through any Starfleet hoops.

13:10.332 --> 13:12.372
You want to give me your version?

13:12.543 --> 13:15.627
Commander, we'll live up to
our responsibilities on this ship.

13:15.796 --> 13:19.379
But we won't be treated
like teenage cadets.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.672
- I see.
- It was ridiculous.

13:21.844 --> 13:26.256
- Tuvok had Chell running laps.
- And he was picking on Gerron.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.765
- I don't like it.
- Really?

13:29.935 --> 13:34.930
Commander, you know that we're used
to playing with a different rulebook.

13:35.107 --> 13:40.148
There's the Starfleet way
and there's the Maquis way.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.654
- You want to do it the Maquis way?
- That's right.

13:43.824 --> 13:46.300
That's always worked for us.

13:55.919 --> 13:58.780
That's the Maquis way too, isn't it?

13:58.255 --> 14:01.420
If you want to keep doing it
the Maquis way, that's fine with me.

14:01.216 --> 14:06.590
We can do that everyday,
until you report to Lieutenant Tuvok.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.803
You understand me?

14:08.974 --> 14:13.102
What? How does a Starfleet crewman
answer a question?

14:13.270 --> 14:16.306
Yes... sir.

14:21.153 --> 14:23.608
Does anybody else have a problem?

14:45.427 --> 14:48.463
These are your study assignments
for next week.

14:48.639 --> 14:54.600
Examinations will be conducted
randomly with no advance notice.

14:54.228 --> 14:57.347
I will now inspect your uniforms.

14:57.523 --> 15:00.607
Crewman Henley,
your headband is certainly festive.

15:00.776 --> 15:04.441
- Thank you.
- It's in violation of regulations.

15:04.613 --> 15:09.489
Please check the protocol files
for recommended guidelines.

15:11.328 --> 15:16.286
- What is this?
- It's a kazleti design.

15:16.458 --> 15:19.909
I studied the technique
when I visited their planet.

15:20.870 --> 15:24.547
- I know it doesn't look complicated...
- It's in violation of the dress code.

15:24.716 --> 15:28.666
- You could hardly see it.
- You will remove it now.

15:32.975 --> 15:37.435
- I know. I'll have to take off the earring.
- Correct.

15:37.604 --> 15:42.562
Also, your boots are scuffed. From
now on, you'll arrive in polished boots.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.774
Yes, sir.

15:46.697 --> 15:50.564
- Do you have a problem, Mr Dalby?
- No, sir.

15:50.742 --> 15:56.496
Very well. You will all report to me
on deck 11 at 1900 hours. Dismissed.

15:56.665 --> 16:01.208
- What will we be doing?
- You'll find that out at 1900 hours.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.667
Dismissed.

16:11.555 --> 16:15.255
I'm going through with this field
training... as ordered.

16:15.434 --> 16:19.520
But I can't say it's very productive.
It feels like punishment.

16:19.229 --> 16:23.309
You're afraid you won't make it.
That you'll fail this training.

16:23.483 --> 16:28.270
Excuse me? That's not what
I said... or what I'm thinking.

16:29.990 --> 16:35.411
What? You think I can't make it through
this ridiculous exercise?

16:35.579 --> 16:40.371
- That's absurd!
- Fine. Then make it through.

16:42.127 --> 16:44.665
- It's another power failure!
- It's the gel packs again.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.878
Deck 4, section 9C.

16:47.490 --> 16:48.247
Bridge to engineering. Report.

16:48.425 --> 16:53.502
It's another malfunction.
We're putting a repair crew on it now.

16:53.680 --> 16:59.968
Dalby, replace the failed gel pack
and check out the adjoining circuits.

17:00.145 --> 17:02.683
We can't keep replacing these things.

17:02.856 --> 17:06.605
Ensign, you're in charge till I get back.
I'll be in sickbay.

17:09.195 --> 17:12.150
- What is it?
- It's your new patient.

17:12.324 --> 17:14.695
It's one of the bio-neural gel packs.

17:14.867 --> 17:19.743
Yes, I'm aware of these devices.
But I've never seen one.

17:19.915 --> 17:23.747
I can't find anything
mechanically wrong with it.

17:23.919 --> 17:26.624
I thought you could look
at the biological component.

17:26.797 --> 17:28.836
Interesting.

17:30.968 --> 17:33.459
Initiate the scan.

17:33.637 --> 17:36.450
Scanning beam is active.

17:37.891 --> 17:41.177
- What?
- The patient is sick.

17:41.937 --> 17:43.976
Can you be more specific?

17:44.147 --> 17:48.975
Discussing this in front of the patient
would breach professional etiquette.

17:50.404 --> 17:55.279
It's been suggested I cultivate a greater
sensitivity to my patients' needs.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.858
- Don't worry, my little friend.
- Doctor!

17:58.996 --> 18:05.793
The biological component has
an infection. A very contagious one.

18:05.961 --> 18:11.380
- Is the crew in any danger?
- I don't detect any infection in you.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.921
The contagion isn't harmful
to humanoids.

18:14.940 --> 18:17.178
If it were, we would have seen
evidence of illness by now.

18:17.347 --> 18:23.432
In order to protect the circuitry, you'll
have to isolate all the affected packs.

18:23.604 --> 18:26.439
I'll take the forward grids off-line.
We'll lose replicators.

18:26.607 --> 18:29.524
I can re-route the primary systems.
How long do you need?

18:29.693 --> 18:33.821
I don't know. Unless we find the source
of the infection, we can't stop it.

18:33.989 --> 18:37.323
OK. I'll tell the captain.

18:37.492 --> 18:41.620
You'll be taking a 10 kilometre run.
I've cleared deck 13 of personnel.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.865
Make sure your packs
are secured to avoid chafing.

18:44.410 --> 18:49.820
Could I just carry Henley?
She weighs the same!

18:50.922 --> 18:54.671
We will get to deck 13
by using the Jefferies tubes.

18:54.843 --> 19:00.716
- At least it's only two decks down.
- Not that way, crewman.

19:00.891 --> 19:05.469
- We'll get to deck 13 via the mess hall.
- That's on deck 2!

19:05.646 --> 19:08.433
We'd have to crawl
through over 50 Jefferies tubes.

19:08.607 --> 19:12.770
I'm glad to see your knowledge
of the ship's structure is improving.

19:12.945 --> 19:14.984
Crewman Gerron, lead the way.

20:02.744 --> 20:07.380
Thank you!
You can stay there as long as you like.

20:07.958 --> 20:10.579
This pack feels
like it's filled with latinum bricks.

20:10.752 --> 20:15.913
Crewman Gerron, what is
the problem up there? Keep going.

20:16.910 --> 20:19.211
Maybe he'll slip and plunge to his death.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.803
Be my guest.

20:57.507 --> 21:01.754
- The 10 kilometres begin now.
- My legs feel like lead pipes!

21:01.929 --> 21:06.920
- Keep your mind on something else.
- The pain in my shoulders?

21:27.704 --> 21:33.161
- That was a run of 10.1 kilometres.
- That was a death march!

21:33.335 --> 21:37.712
You may be experiencing difficulty.
I increased gravity on this deck by 10%.

21:37.881 --> 21:39.957
What?

21:41.176 --> 21:43.216
You don't know what conditions
you may encounter.

21:43.387 --> 21:45.463
You must be prepared for anything.

21:45.639 --> 21:49.933
Crewmen Gerron and Chell,
you have not completed your run.

21:50.102 --> 21:55.143
We have lapped you three times.
You will finish the 10 kilometres now.

22:02.906 --> 22:08.280
We'll repeat this tomorrow. I'll expect
you to better your performance.

22:23.135 --> 22:25.174
Have you found traces of the bacteria?

22:25.345 --> 22:30.588
I've checked the logs.
The biofilter didn't pick up anything.

22:30.767 --> 22:34.350
We stopped at that planet, Napinne...
Brought on some food stores.

22:34.521 --> 22:37.190
- Some of it looked strange.
- Right.

22:37.357 --> 22:40.358
Varmeliate fibre... whole green putillos,
and schplicht.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.935
- Schplicht?
- Grakel milk.

22:43.113 --> 22:46.233
I've looked at the logs.
Everything checked out.

22:46.408 --> 22:51.403
Let's go over the environmental
systems. Maybe it's airborne.

22:52.497 --> 22:55.997
- He's been at it since before I got here.
- Chell!

22:56.919 --> 22:59.492
What are you doing?

22:59.671 --> 23:03.965
Mr Tuvok ordered me to degauss
the entire transporter room.

23:04.134 --> 23:07.468
- But you're using a micro-resonator.
- I know.

23:07.638 --> 23:11.540
Why not use the magneton scanner?
You'd be done in five minutes.

23:11.224 --> 23:13.716
Tuvok told him
to use the micro-resonator.

23:13.894 --> 23:20.431
- But he'll be at it for hours!
- Mr Tuvok estimated 26.3 hours.

23:20.609 --> 23:26.612
- Sounds like a Tuvok estimate.
- Well, good luck.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.865
You missed a spot.

23:35.791 --> 23:38.790
Security log, supplemental.

23:38.252 --> 23:40.624
I've recreated
the Voyager bridge on the holodeck

23:40.796 --> 23:42.835
and scheduled a war game simulation.

23:43.600 --> 23:49.460
I hope that an exercise in teamwork
will instil a sense of participation.

23:49.638 --> 23:53.967
On the bridge we depend on the
smooth functioning of every crewman.

23:54.142 --> 23:57.600
You are the captain's eyes,
ears and hands.

23:57.229 --> 24:00.230
You must function
as one perfectly-tuned unit.

24:00.399 --> 24:03.768
Mr Dalby, I understand you have
command experience.

24:03.944 --> 24:06.316
- Yes, sir.
- You have the bridge.

24:06.488 --> 24:09.109
The programme
will present you with random events

24:09.283 --> 24:12.983
that you must deal with
in whatever manner you see fit.

24:13.161 --> 24:14.988
I understand.

24:15.164 --> 24:18.248
Programme will be initiated
when you set a course.

24:18.417 --> 24:21.252
- All set?
- Ready.

24:21.461 --> 24:27.749
Mr Chell, ahead warp 6.
Heading 159, mark 7.

24:27.926 --> 24:30.464
Mr Gerron,
what's the nearest star system?

24:30.637 --> 24:34.552
I'm showing a red giant system,
3.7 light years from our current position.

24:34.725 --> 24:36.764
There are eight planets.

24:36.935 --> 24:39.260
- We're picking up a distress call.
- Source?

24:39.438 --> 24:42.142
Unknown.
There's subspace interference.

24:42.316 --> 24:45.435
- Gerron, can you get a fix?
- Sensors show a Ferengi ship.

24:45.611 --> 24:48.944
It's heavily damaged.
Eight life-form readings... very faint.

24:49.114 --> 24:52.697
- Hail them.
- They're not responding.

24:53.619 --> 24:55.695
I must point out that the Ferengi

24:55.871 --> 24:59.322
have deceived other ships
by pretending to be damaged.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.539
We could be falling into a trap.

25:01.710 --> 25:04.283
We have a duty to offer
humanitarian aid, if we can.

25:04.463 --> 25:06.954
Chell,
change course to intercept.

25:08.550 --> 25:11.410
- Course laid in, sir.
- Proceed.

25:11.219 --> 25:13.342
A Romulan warbird
is decloaking off the port bow.

25:13.514 --> 25:15.720
Red Alert.

25:15.891 --> 25:18.678
Hail them. Let them know
we're on a rescue mission.

25:18.852 --> 25:21.604
- They're powering up weapons.
- No response to the hail.

25:21.772 --> 25:25.437
- Evasive manoeuvres, Mr Chell.
- Initiating evasion sequence.

25:27.945 --> 25:31.360
We've been hit on the lateral phaser
array. Shields at 81%.

25:31.531 --> 25:35.315
- Arm all forward phasers.
- A second ship is decloaking.

25:35.494 --> 25:38.163
It's launching torpedoes.

25:39.665 --> 25:42.582
Damage to decks 11 through 15.
Reports of casualties.

25:42.751 --> 25:45.871
Arm all photon banks.
Mr Chell, continuous evasive action.

25:46.460 --> 25:49.470
- Henley, fire at will.
- Aye, sir.

25:50.133 --> 25:52.589
Hull breach on deck 9.

25:52.761 --> 25:56.110
Keep firing, Henley. Let's do as much
damage as we can.

25:59.268 --> 26:02.387
Computer, reset programme.

26:05.983 --> 26:09.102
Your first command together
was less than successful.

26:09.278 --> 26:11.685
You are all dead.

26:11.864 --> 26:16.270
It was a no-win situation.
What were we supposed to do?

26:16.201 --> 26:18.906
Can anyone answer that question?

26:21.957 --> 26:24.626
I thought we went by the book.

26:24.793 --> 26:28.458
I certainly did everything
I could possibly do.

26:28.630 --> 26:32.295
My evasive action sequences
cannot be faltered.

26:32.467 --> 26:35.587
At least we went out
with our phasers firing.

26:35.762 --> 26:40.555
Mr Gerron,
do you have something to add?

26:40.726 --> 26:43.980
- What does it matter?
- It matters.

26:43.270 --> 26:46.639
If you don't learn from your mistakes,
you'll repeat them.

26:46.815 --> 26:52.320
I was in command. Blame me.
The crew were following my orders.

26:52.487 --> 26:54.895
Have you reached a conclusion?

26:55.730 --> 26:59.202
I thought I did everything I could.
We were just out-gunned.

26:59.369 --> 27:03.367
I see. Did the possibility of retreat
not occur to you?

27:03.540 --> 27:07.750
- Retreat?
- I can't believe you'd say that!

27:07.252 --> 27:13.600
The strongest tactical move is to reap
the highest gain at the lowest cost.

27:13.175 --> 27:16.674
Going out with "phasers firing"
may seem heroic,

27:16.845 --> 27:22.500
but it is merely foolish.
Retreat is often the best option.

27:22.184 --> 27:27.523
Well, Mr Tuvok,
once more you've proven your point.

27:27.689 --> 27:30.939
We're just not Starfleet material.

27:33.153 --> 27:37.210
Are we dismissed... sir?

27:38.367 --> 27:41.403
Dismissed. Computer, exit.

28:08.146 --> 28:12.524
I feel that my services,
as morale officer, are required.

28:13.443 --> 28:16.777
- You are wrong.
- Really?

28:16.947 --> 28:20.731
One, no cup of tea. Two, no padd.

28:20.909 --> 28:24.954
Three, you're sitting
on the opposite side from usual.

28:25.122 --> 28:29.451
That tells me
you've got something on your mind.

28:29.626 --> 28:32.117
What tells me
that it's making you miserable

28:32.296 --> 28:37.500
is that cloud of doom
that's rising from you like a ground fog.

28:38.385 --> 28:43.380
I cannot imagine that there are visual
emanations that can tell you my mood.

28:43.557 --> 28:48.302
- You are making wild assumptions.
- Maquis trainees getting you down?

28:51.273 --> 28:55.105
I don't believe they're
responding well to my instruction.

28:56.111 --> 28:58.863
What seems to be the problem?

28:59.310 --> 29:02.115
That's what
I've been trying to determine.

29:02.284 --> 29:08.536
I'm afraid that I'm at a loss.
I have taught thousands of cadets.

29:08.707 --> 29:11.993
And I have never
encountered these difficulties.

29:12.169 --> 29:15.419
My methods are sound
and time-honoured.

29:15.589 --> 29:18.756
I insist on strict adherence
to rules and protocols.

29:18.926 --> 29:21.840
I never waiver from that approach.

29:21.261 --> 29:26.422
I've always been successful in honing
each cadet into a Starfleet officer.

29:30.479 --> 29:33.682
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

29:36.860 --> 29:39.670
These are keela flowers.

29:39.947 --> 29:46.910
Beautiful... and strong. The stem is
flexible... and impossible to break.

29:47.790 --> 29:54.161
But, occasionally, on the same plant,
there's a bloom which is not so flexible.

29:54.336 --> 29:58.832
Here's one.
And when the stem is brittle... it breaks.

29:59.841 --> 30:03.293
You're saying that the
Maquis crew is rigid and inflexible.

30:03.470 --> 30:06.720
That they will never
adjust to Starfleet rules.

30:06.890 --> 30:11.267
No, Mr Vulcan. I'm saying that
you are rigid and inflexible.

30:11.436 --> 30:17.309
Maybe if you learn to bend a little... you
might have better luck with your class.

30:17.484 --> 30:21.612
Those Maquis aren't Starfleet cadets.
You can't treat them the same way.

30:21.780 --> 30:25.992
Get to know them.
Try to find out what they're like inside.

30:26.159 --> 30:29.694
You might discover
a better teaching method.

30:29.872 --> 30:35.992
I'm not sure I have the ability
to "find out what they're like inside".

30:36.169 --> 30:38.743
Mr Neelix, what is that?

30:40.382 --> 30:45.377
Brill cheese! I made it from that
schplicht we brought on board.

30:45.554 --> 30:50.263
Ensign Ashmore asked for something
called macaroni and cheese.

30:50.434 --> 30:54.763
Cheese. You must cultivate bacteria
to make cheese.

30:54.938 --> 30:56.978
Of course.

31:14.416 --> 31:17.951
Captain's log, stardate 48859.3.

31:18.128 --> 31:21.462
Lieutenant Tuvok has reported
a possible explanation

31:21.632 --> 31:24.301
for the infection in the gel packs.

31:24.468 --> 31:28.964
I have asked Lieutenant Torres and her
team to investigate Neelix's kitchen.

31:29.139 --> 31:33.303
Get me a schematic of the airflow
patterns for the whole ship.

31:33.477 --> 31:37.177
The cheese
is full of volatile bacterial spores.

31:37.356 --> 31:40.356
It must stay isolated
in this containment field.

31:40.526 --> 31:43.361
- What is this?
- That's a Laurelian pudding.

31:43.529 --> 31:45.568
It has to simmer for four hours.

31:46.782 --> 31:49.901
The spores must have
travelled through that intake

31:50.770 --> 31:52.116
and then into the ventilation system.

31:52.287 --> 31:56.367
They were disseminated throughout
the ship, infecting the circuitry.

31:57.459 --> 32:01.920
I feel awful about this.
I assure you, I had no idea.

32:03.131 --> 32:05.171
More gel packs must be down.

32:05.342 --> 32:10.870
If this gets into the environmental
systems, we may be in further trouble.

32:10.264 --> 32:13.134
Neelix, this wasn't your fault.

32:13.308 --> 32:15.978
The important thing
is we've found the source.

32:16.144 --> 32:20.391
Get the cheese to sickbay. The doctor
should look at it as soon as possible.

32:26.113 --> 32:28.355
You may break, Mr Dalby.

32:31.827 --> 32:33.238
OK.

32:44.965 --> 32:49.876
- Do you play pool often?
- Not really. I did when I was younger.

32:56.184 --> 33:00.811
- Do you have a family?
- What is this about?

33:00.981 --> 33:03.816
- Pardon.
- This... little exercise.

33:03.984 --> 33:08.646
Are we testing my social skills?
Does Starfleet have rules about them?

33:08.822 --> 33:11.906
I had thought we could
get to know each other.

33:12.750 --> 33:16.730
Perhaps then our relationship
would function more smoothly.

33:16.246 --> 33:18.286
Get to know each other?

33:19.583 --> 33:24.708
OK. Here's the brief history
of Kenneth Dalby.

33:24.880 --> 33:29.376
We lived on the Bajoran frontier.
It was a hard life.

33:30.469 --> 33:36.222
I coped by getting into trouble. I was
angry at everybody and everything.

33:36.391 --> 33:40.436
Till the woman came along
who taught me about love.

33:40.604 --> 33:43.521
For a while, I wasn't angry any more.

33:49.196 --> 33:53.280
Three Cardassians raped her
and smashed her skull.

33:53.200 --> 33:58.325
I joined the Maquis and tried to
slaughter as many of them as I could.

33:58.497 --> 34:00.620
How about you? Any family?

34:02.793 --> 34:07.751
I do. But there is nothing to report
that would compare with your story.

34:10.500 --> 34:13.917
I have observed that you seem
to be protective of Mr Gerron.

34:14.960 --> 34:20.514
- Have you formed a friendship?
- No. He won't let me get close.

34:20.686 --> 34:25.763
First time I saw him, I thought
I was looking at myself at that age.

34:25.940 --> 34:29.773
I thought maybe I could be a friend.
Maybe he wouldn't turn out how I did.

34:31.112 --> 34:36.239
But I didn't have much luck.
Then we got stuck out here.

34:37.159 --> 34:40.860
Being so far away from home
is hard on somebody that young.

34:41.389 --> 34:45.203
Don't make him more miserable
than he is already.

34:46.712 --> 34:50.875
Commander Chakotay recommended
Mr Gerron for this programme.

34:51.489 --> 34:54.300
He felt that if the young man
were able to learn new skills,

34:54.177 --> 35:00.298
to set goals and accomplish them, it
may help him feel better about himself.

35:00.475 --> 35:06.929
- That's why he's in this group?
- We want it to be positive for everyone.

35:08.442 --> 35:12.653
If you say so.
But understand this, Lieutenant.

35:16.408 --> 35:21.782
I don't want to get to know you
and I don't want to be your friend.

35:27.836 --> 35:31.964
This is the most pernicious
infective agent I've ever seen.

35:32.132 --> 35:36.260
It attacked every cell
in the gel pack's biological matrix.

35:36.428 --> 35:39.382
I've exposed it to every anti-bacterial
agent we have.

35:39.556 --> 35:41.596
It hasn't responded.

35:43.811 --> 35:46.218
Sickbay to bridge. What's happening?

35:46.396 --> 35:49.979
We're losing more bio-neural circuitry.

35:50.150 --> 35:53.934
- Tell me you have good news.
- I'm afraid not.

35:54.112 --> 35:59.237
- I'm at a loss but we'll keep trying.
- Please do. Janeway out.

35:59.409 --> 36:04.830
It's curious that these bacteria didn't
show in any of our diagnostic scans.

36:04.998 --> 36:10.704
But if the bacteria
didn't spread from the cheese,

36:10.879 --> 36:13.417
how did the gel packs get infected?

36:13.590 --> 36:19.629
- Viruses can live inside bacteria.
- Of course, a virus.

36:19.805 --> 36:22.510
The bacteria could be hosts
to the infectious virus.

36:22.683 --> 36:24.722
They are so small
they can escape detection.

36:24.893 --> 36:28.600
Maybe we should try
the anti-viral agents.

36:28.230 --> 36:30.768
It's certainly worth a try.

36:31.733 --> 36:34.403
I think the inertial dampeners
are malfunctioning.

36:34.569 --> 36:38.816
- Along with other things.
- Class dismissed. Return to stations.

36:40.993 --> 36:42.902
Lieutenant!

36:50.586 --> 36:52.744
We're stuck in here.

36:52.921 --> 36:55.459
The bio-neural network is failing.

36:55.632 --> 36:58.503
We're losing systems faster
than we can compensate.

36:58.677 --> 37:02.722
- Isolinear circuitry?
- Torres is working on it.

37:02.890 --> 37:07.136
- It can't maintain life-support yet.
- Propulsion is down.

37:07.311 --> 37:12.601
Every system on the main grid is down.
Including turbolifts and life-support.

37:12.774 --> 37:15.444
- Bridge to engineering.
- Torres here.

37:15.611 --> 37:21.400
Transfer power to life-support and
keep working on the isolinear circuitry.

37:26.830 --> 37:31.408
- The manual override isn't working.
- Can't get the cargo door open, either.

37:31.585 --> 37:36.496
Tuvok to bridge.
Is anyone receiving this message?

37:38.800 --> 37:42.836
It appears our stations will have
to do without us for the time being.

37:47.976 --> 37:53.563
Captain, life-support is failing.
Deck 15 has lost all power.

37:53.732 --> 37:58.145
Sickbay to bridge.
I believe we may have something.

37:58.320 --> 38:01.321
The gel packs are incapable
of responding to an infection

38:01.490 --> 38:04.407
in the same way
that humanoid organisms do.

38:04.576 --> 38:06.485
- With a fever.
- Exactly.

38:06.662 --> 38:11.656
We have experimented with heating the
samples and the results are promising.

38:11.833 --> 38:16.579
We don't have the heat needed
to wipe out a ship-wide infection.

38:16.755 --> 38:19.590
- Janeway to Torres.
- Torres here.

38:19.758 --> 38:25.970
If we wanted to super-heat
the gel packs, how could we do it?

38:25.264 --> 38:30.637
We could infuse the circuits
with a high-energy plasma burst.

38:30.811 --> 38:34.310
But we'd have to generate it by
inverting the warp-field toward the ship.

38:34.481 --> 38:39.226
We could produce the energy by getting
the warp engines to 80% of maximum

38:39.403 --> 38:42.653
while we're standing still.
Then initiate the plasma burst.

38:42.823 --> 38:45.444
Can we get to 80%?

38:45.617 --> 38:51.204
If we re-route the emergency power to
the warp engines, but it's a risky move.

38:51.373 --> 38:55.999
I'm aware of that
but I think we have to try it.

38:56.169 --> 39:00.997
Divert all power, including life-support,
to the warp engines.

39:01.175 --> 39:04.590
Mr Paris,
deactivate the nacelle control system.

39:04.761 --> 39:07.715
Prepare to engage the warp engines.

39:08.807 --> 39:11.179
Nacelle control deactivated.

39:11.351 --> 39:14.210
- Ready to go.
- Do it!

39:22.700 --> 39:24.193
What's that noise?

39:26.950 --> 39:30.651
- This conduit is getting very hot.
- So am I.

39:30.829 --> 39:33.237
It's getting awfully warm in here.

39:33.415 --> 39:36.749
Something's very wrong.
I don't like this at all.

39:36.919 --> 39:40.963
I think the captain is trying to deal
with the systems failures.

39:41.131 --> 39:44.915
Not knowing what that entails
may lead us to think the worst.

39:45.930 --> 39:47.549
We must not let fear get the best of us.

39:50.974 --> 39:55.102
Mr Gerron, it's possible the console
in the control room is still functioning.

39:55.270 --> 39:58.354
See if you can open
the doors from there.

39:59.441 --> 40:04.684
We can also attempt to access one of
the Jefferies tubes through the bulkhead.

40:07.366 --> 40:10.283
I don't know about the bacteria,
but I'm ready to pass out.

40:10.452 --> 40:14.781
Engines are only 74% of maximum.
That's not enough for a plasma burst.

40:14.957 --> 40:17.198
Increase anti-matter flow.

40:20.212 --> 40:25.400
It's having an effect. Temperature is at
340 kelvin. Can we get it a little hotter?

40:25.217 --> 40:29.297
Mr Paris,
get us to 80% of maximum... somehow.

40:29.471 --> 40:32.342
I'll try.

40:33.350 --> 40:37.217
- We're at 360 kelvins.
- Engines are at 79% of maximum.

40:37.396 --> 40:39.602
- I think we can risk it.
- Bridge to Torres.

40:39.773 --> 40:44.670
- Initiate the plasma burst.
- It may blow some conduits.

40:44.236 --> 40:46.270
Acknowledged.

40:52.536 --> 40:56.450
The plasma gas will be toxic in minutes.
We must leave immediately.

40:56.623 --> 40:59.541
What about Gerron?

41:01.378 --> 41:04.295
- We can't leave him!
- Get in the Jefferies tube.

41:04.464 --> 41:08.842
- I can't lose any more of you.
- What's that? A Starfleet rule?

41:09.100 --> 41:11.762
It's tactically correct
to sacrifice the few for the many.

41:11.930 --> 41:18.182
I don't give a Circassian fig what's
correct. I'm going back for him.

41:19.396 --> 41:23.263
Get in the Jefferies tube now!

41:23.483 --> 41:26.568
I will break your arm
if you do not follow my order.

41:26.737 --> 41:31.944
- I won't forget. You're letting him die!
- Keep moving!

41:42.794 --> 41:44.917
Janeway to sickbay, report.

41:45.880 --> 41:47.164
Bacterial levels are dropping.

41:47.341 --> 41:51.587
We should be able to purge
the system within a few minutes.

41:51.761 --> 41:55.213
We need life-support
back on-line as soon as possible.

41:55.390 --> 41:59.305
I'll get back to you right away,
Captain.

42:44.147 --> 42:49.105
Sickbay to bridge.
Can anyone hear me?

42:49.278 --> 42:52.729
- Come in, Doctor.
- All bacteria have been destroyed.

42:52.906 --> 42:56.524
The danger of further infection
has passed.

42:58.286 --> 43:04.455
Mr Kim,
start getting our systems back on-line.

43:04.626 --> 43:07.711
Aye, Captain.

43:28.233 --> 43:30.689
Come on, come on!

43:48.170 --> 43:51.500
I think he's all right.

43:51.965 --> 43:57.304
I thought Starfleet rules said that was
an unacceptable risk... saving him.

43:57.471 --> 44:02.892
It was. However,
I've realised that there are times

44:03.600 --> 44:06.725
when it is desirable to bend the rules.

44:06.897 --> 44:10.147
Lieutenant,
if you can learn to bend the rules...

44:11.151 --> 44:13.642
I guess we can learn to follow them.

44:15.823 --> 44:19.571
Let's get you two to sickbay.
