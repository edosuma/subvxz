00:34.333 --> 00:37.541
It's 2015,
and people still act like marriage

00:37.625 --> 00:40.333
is some sort of
crowning achievement for women.

00:41.125 --> 00:43.708
That is a trap I did not fall into.

00:43.791 --> 00:47.291
Some people prefer to really feel like
they're holding a knife in their hands.

00:49.500 --> 00:50.916
I dove in headfirst.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.958
Most professional chefs, they prefer…

00:53.041 --> 00:55.166
I don't normally quiver
for cutlery,

00:55.250 --> 00:58.333
but I'm getting married in six weeks,
so here we are.

00:58.416 --> 01:01.208
-Does that mean it's sharper?
-Scary sharp.

01:01.291 --> 01:04.333
And she ain't cheap,
but she is the superior blade.

01:05.416 --> 01:09.750
Well, baby, we can't start married life
with inferior blades.

01:09.833 --> 01:13.250
So you wanna choose a knife
that feels comfortable in your hand.

01:13.875 --> 01:15.416
What do you think of the Zwilling?

01:26.541 --> 01:27.750
Snap out of it, psycho.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.083
It's heavier.

01:31.666 --> 01:33.166
She has the touch.

01:33.250 --> 01:34.333
Oh… Well…

01:34.416 --> 01:39.250
I think being a petite woman,
you'll find the Miyabi easier to manage.

01:41.041 --> 01:43.208
I've managed
to not eat lunch for six years

01:43.291 --> 01:45.750
just to have this joker call me petite.

01:46.583 --> 01:49.458
Petite is what they call short fat girls.

01:49.541 --> 01:52.666
-I should know. I used to be one.

02:01.833 --> 02:02.666
Text your mom.

02:02.750 --> 02:04.750
-Let her know we're officially registered.
-Okay.

02:04.833 --> 02:08.083
Luke Harrison the Fourth
played D1 lacrosse at Colgate,

02:08.166 --> 02:09.375
kite surfs on Nantucket,

02:09.458 --> 02:12.958
and skis in Vail because Aspen
is lousy with the nouveau riche.

02:22.958 --> 02:23.791
Mmm.

02:23.875 --> 02:26.708
He calls me "babe"
with the finest of intentions.

02:26.791 --> 02:27.708
-Let's go, babe.
-Yeah.

02:29.208 --> 02:34.000
Heretofore, it is his birthright to marry
a blond insect of Norwegian descent

02:34.083 --> 02:38.666
with a gender-ambiguous name,
like Landry or Devon,

02:38.750 --> 02:41.541
who can spot my grift a mile away.

02:41.625 --> 02:43.375
Hey, can we get pizza?

02:45.250 --> 02:47.958
Who are you, and what have you done
with my fiancée?

02:48.041 --> 02:49.750
I'm not to the manor born,

02:49.833 --> 02:52.416
but I have something
no trust fund can buy…

02:53.250 --> 02:54.125
the edge.

02:54.833 --> 02:56.791
It doesn't take much in Luke's world.

02:56.875 --> 03:00.125
Love your work, hate babies,
even the cute ones,

03:00.708 --> 03:02.083
have a few lurid secrets,

03:02.166 --> 03:07.416
and be eternally grateful that Luke
knows all of them and still loves me.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.833
Um, my mom is asking
if the invites went out.

03:10.916 --> 03:13.583
Mm. Yeah, once I approve the font.

03:14.291 --> 03:15.916
-Once you approve the font?
-Yes.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.833
Oh. Once Ani approves the font.

03:18.916 --> 03:20.458
-Thank you.

03:23.125 --> 03:26.000
Oh, she's saying
they should go out six weeks before.

03:26.583 --> 03:28.541
-Jesus, are we at six weeks already?
-Yeah.

03:29.791 --> 03:31.333
Whoa, we are at six weeks.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.500
All done here?

03:38.250 --> 03:40.291
-Yeah, maybe just a box, please.
-Sure.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.791
-Loo.
-Okay.

03:56.458 --> 03:58.625
Someone once called me an animal.

03:59.458 --> 04:01.458
One wrong move and Luke will see it too.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.541
Hmm.

04:12.833 --> 04:15.083
You can just take that. Thank you.

04:26.750 --> 04:28.000
Jesus. What happened?

04:28.083 --> 04:31.541
Waitress spilled soda
all over the pizza and my dress.

04:31.625 --> 04:32.541
Oh no.

04:33.708 --> 04:36.333
It's gonna be okay, babe. Okay?

04:36.916 --> 04:38.000
Come on, I'll help you.

04:39.166 --> 04:40.291
Baby, I love you.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.875
Oh! Oh my God.

04:43.958 --> 04:46.583
-I'm so full.
-You hardly ate anything.

04:46.666 --> 04:49.375
Okay, so maybe I keep
some secrets from him,

04:49.458 --> 04:52.000
but no one has ever made me feel so safe.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.875
I'm proud of you
for eating carbs, babe.

04:54.458 --> 04:57.666
I wanna see every one of you
dripping in sweat.

04:58.166 --> 05:01.458
Nothing is so bad that you can't do it
for ten more seconds.

05:01.541 --> 05:03.833
["Keep It Movin'"

05:07.958 --> 05:11.041
by
Stanton Warriors & Tony Quattro continues]

05:13.541 --> 05:15.666
-Ugh! Nineteen minutes?

05:16.333 --> 05:17.958
Some people have jobs to get to.

05:18.041 --> 05:19.958
I mean, not me, but some people.

05:20.791 --> 05:22.166
But I can't be late today.

05:22.666 --> 05:24.958
Oh my God. Are you meeting
the documentary director today?

05:25.041 --> 05:25.875
Yes.

05:25.958 --> 05:28.541
Okay, well,
you're not gonna be late on my watch.

05:28.625 --> 05:31.875
Nell Rutherford has been fostering
me since freshman year of college.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.041
I know you never take the subway.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.875
Oh God, no, no, no.
I-I really-- I really hate this.

05:36.958 --> 05:38.833
Okay. By your side.

05:38.916 --> 05:41.041
Nell is a natural blond
with a trust fund.

05:41.541 --> 05:44.166
I'm a try-hard former financial-aid kid.

05:44.666 --> 05:46.291
We both hate where we came from.

05:46.375 --> 05:48.125
Your mom's coming this weekend, right?

05:48.208 --> 05:49.458
Oh, yes.

05:49.541 --> 05:51.625
She's been to TJ Maxx three times

05:51.708 --> 05:57.541
to try to find an outfit for my fitting
at Saks Fifth Avenue on the 5th Avenue.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.125
Wow, what is the opposite of a legend?

06:02.000 --> 06:06.250
Okay, I think this one is the most you.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.083
What? Only You Pro?

06:08.166 --> 06:09.125
Oh.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.208
Would you pick it?

06:16.958 --> 06:20.125
I mean, I'm not getting married
until we have a woman for president,

06:20.208 --> 06:22.625
so I guess we'll know soon enough.

06:23.833 --> 06:24.708
Uh…

06:31.583 --> 06:34.625
I, uh… I'm still scared
I'm making a mistake.

06:35.666 --> 06:36.625
Getting married?

06:37.708 --> 06:41.000
No. No, like is Only You Pro
the font of a trash slut

06:41.083 --> 06:44.041
who doesn't know how to pass
the salt and pepper shakers together.

06:44.125 --> 06:48.416
Oh my God, there is no such thing
as a slutty font. It doesn't exist.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.833
God, I can't breathe.

06:50.875 --> 06:51.791
Oh my God.

06:58.208 --> 06:59.125
It's okay.

06:59.625 --> 07:01.000
Oh my God. Oh my God.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.791
This is normal. Okay?
This happens all the time.

07:03.875 --> 07:05.666
We are experiencing a delay…

07:05.750 --> 07:08.125
-It's no big deal.
-…due to train traffic ahead of us.

07:08.208 --> 07:09.666
Thank you for your patience.

07:10.166 --> 07:11.333
-You okay?

07:11.416 --> 07:12.875
There we go. See?

07:13.666 --> 07:16.041
Next stop 34th Street-Herald Square.

07:16.125 --> 07:18.208
-And we're moving. Okay.
-Oh my God.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.791
Ugh! Eleanor Whitman.
Brought in from The Atlantic

07:40.875 --> 07:43.583
to elevate the overly-sex
fashion glossy where I work.

07:44.083 --> 07:45.250
How was your weekend?

07:46.041 --> 07:49.375
I feel like I ran a half-marathon
through Williams-Sonoma.

07:49.458 --> 07:51.083
-Williams-Sonoma?
-Yeah.

07:51.166 --> 07:54.833
You should register for a few pieces
at Scully & Scully if you can.

07:54.916 --> 07:56.625
I'm sure Luke's family
would go in on them.

07:56.708 --> 07:58.916
The fuck is Scully & Scully?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.916
Obsessed with Scully & Scully.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.708
My bedroom sconces are from there.

08:03.791 --> 08:05.041
-Mmm.

08:09.458 --> 08:12.416
Eleanor gets to write about topics
with gravitas,

08:12.500 --> 08:15.625
like the wage gap
and women in Afghanistan.

08:15.708 --> 08:18.250
I'm on another equally important beat.

08:18.333 --> 08:20.291
Your voice, Miss FaNelli…

08:21.958 --> 08:24.041
is simply peerless.

08:25.166 --> 08:28.125
My jaw hurts
after reading that.

08:31.750 --> 08:34.041
This is what sells our magazine.

08:34.125 --> 08:37.750
Apparently men's pleasure
is of global importance.

08:52.208 --> 08:54.791
So a recent study
in the American Journal of Public Health

08:54.875 --> 08:58.916
found that last year,
30% of sexual assault survivors

08:59.000 --> 09:02.291
had to pay $940 for their own rape kits.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.791
That's a girl's whole paycheck.

09:03.875 --> 09:05.000
Right. So I was thinking

09:05.083 --> 09:07.625
"The Real Cost of Sexual Assault"
as the cover line.

09:07.708 --> 09:10.166
Oh! Lavender. Retch.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.166
Hmm.

09:13.250 --> 09:16.500
How about, "When Your Rape
Costs More than Your Rent"?

09:17.875 --> 09:20.166
Now that gets us on The Today Show.

09:21.833 --> 09:23.000
Mm…

09:23.583 --> 09:27.083
Miss FaNelli, give me something skanky
to keep the lights on.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.416
Okay.

09:29.708 --> 09:31.333
Let's see, skanky…

09:32.583 --> 09:35.708
Okay, a new study
in the Journal of Kinesiology

09:35.791 --> 09:39.250
found that nasal breathing
is optimal for sports performance

09:39.333 --> 09:41.791
and is used by some
of the top athletes around the world.

09:41.875 --> 09:46.333
So, "Five Weeks to an Olympian Blow -

09:46.958 --> 09:48.541
Breathe Like a Top Athlete

09:48.625 --> 09:52.083
to Last Longer and Go Deeper than His Ex."

09:55.791 --> 09:58.041
When I count my blessings,
I count you twice.

09:58.833 --> 10:00.666
-Draft by the end of the week?
-Yeah.

10:01.875 --> 10:03.500
-Thank you, everyone.

10:03.583 --> 10:04.541
Come with me.

10:09.333 --> 10:12.541
It's gonna be your name on the masthead
of The New York Times Magazine.

10:13.208 --> 10:16.166
Lower than mine, but it beats
a Cuisinart for a wedding gift.

10:18.375 --> 10:21.375
I am this close
to becoming Ani Harrison,

10:21.458 --> 10:24.291
senior editor
at The New York Times Magazine,

10:24.375 --> 10:26.708
to becoming someone people can respect.

10:37.541 --> 10:41.833
Abstaining from lunch allows me to squat
in Eleanor's office when I need it.

10:54.208 --> 10:58.166
One day, I'll have a corner office
with my own insufferable display

10:58.250 --> 11:01.416
of prestigious
and frankly phallic-looking awards.

11:02.416 --> 11:05.375
Until then, I pretend I'm important.

11:12.166 --> 11:13.958
The rock was Luke's grandmother's.

11:14.041 --> 11:17.291
Oh. Pardon me, his Nana's.

11:18.083 --> 11:20.666
He told me
I could reset it in a diamond band,

11:21.166 --> 11:23.250
what all the girls are doing now.

11:23.333 --> 11:25.666
Exactly why I will never.

11:25.750 --> 11:28.333
I intend to send a very clear message.

11:28.416 --> 11:30.500
This is an heirloom.

11:31.500 --> 11:34.916
We don't just have money.
We come from money.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.750
-Take your best shot.

11:37.833 --> 11:39.666
Hey, Ani. Good to see you again.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.875
Sorry to make you
come all the way to Midtown.

11:41.958 --> 11:43.416
Katie, thank you so much.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.541
Can you please remind Benjamin
that I need the art

11:45.625 --> 11:46.916
for the wage-gap story?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.750
Um, the what story?

11:48.833 --> 11:52.000
The smart story I just made up
to sound more impressive.

11:52.083 --> 11:53.041
Ask Penelope.

11:56.791 --> 11:59.625
-Sit, please.
-I appreciate you making the time.

11:59.708 --> 12:01.208
-Mm-hmm.
-Uh…

12:02.250 --> 12:05.500
I know you said that the documentary
was not the right choice at the moment,

12:05.583 --> 12:09.041
but there's been a pretty sizable
development since the last time we spoke.

12:09.125 --> 12:12.708
Your former classmate, Dean Barton,
has signed on to be interviewed.

12:13.250 --> 12:14.916
Keep it the fuck together, FaNelli.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.583
I guess it shouldn't be a surprise
he has a new book to promote.

12:17.666 --> 12:20.000
I'm sure you saw his speech
before Congress this summer.

12:20.083 --> 12:21.666
Only 200 times.

12:21.750 --> 12:22.583
No.

12:23.083 --> 12:26.500
Oh, it was a plea to tighten
firearm background checks in Pennsylvania.

12:27.083 --> 12:29.458
Your ring. Show him your ring.

12:29.541 --> 12:36.291
I'm afraid I've been preoccupied
this summer with planning the wedding

12:36.375 --> 12:39.500
and the magazine's initiative
with Hillary's campaign.

12:40.083 --> 12:42.708
I can't imagine what it's like
to have people grilling you about it

12:42.791 --> 12:44.291
so many years later.

12:45.166 --> 12:47.958
You're a survivor of the deadliest
private-school shooting in history.

12:48.041 --> 12:50.958
And the reason it continues
to captivate public interest

12:51.041 --> 12:53.666
is because there are still
so many questions you never answered.

12:54.291 --> 12:57.375
People wanna know were you a hero
or an accomplice?

12:58.291 --> 12:59.875
I had absolutely nothing to do with it.

12:59.958 --> 13:01.958
-Then why does Dean say you did?
-I don't know.

13:02.041 --> 13:04.125
Don't you wanna tell your side
of the story?

13:04.208 --> 13:06.833
-Miss FaNelli. Right at home, I see.

13:06.916 --> 13:09.625
I need three to five cover line tries
for the simultaneous orgasm story

13:09.708 --> 13:11.083
by the time I get back from lunch.

13:17.083 --> 13:20.166
LoLo Vincent,
editor-in-chief of The Women's Bible.

13:20.250 --> 13:22.083
Aaron Wickersham, independent filmmaker.

13:22.166 --> 13:25.958
Oh, that's right. I saw your short at the
Toronto Film Festival a few years back.

13:26.041 --> 13:28.333
Are you our hot guy of the month
for December?

13:29.083 --> 13:32.458
Actually, I'm working on a documentary
about gun violence in schools.

13:33.416 --> 13:34.750
I'm hoping to talk to…

13:34.833 --> 13:35.833
Don't say it.

13:35.916 --> 13:36.750
…TifAni.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.083
Oh.

13:38.791 --> 13:40.458
I always forget that's your name.

13:42.166 --> 13:43.208
Ani's pithier.

13:49.250 --> 13:50.916
My team has spent the last year

13:51.000 --> 13:53.125
researching the incident
at your high school.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.666
My intention is not to upset you
by saying this,

13:55.750 --> 13:58.708
but we've uncovered
a very different side to the story.

13:58.791 --> 14:01.333
I promise you,
I'm only after the truth here.

14:01.416 --> 14:04.333
I give you my word that our work together
will not cause you further harm.

14:04.416 --> 14:06.375
As long as you get
your sensational story.

14:07.625 --> 14:11.541
I'm sorry, but there's just no way that
you can promise me something like that.

14:15.750 --> 14:17.708
What if I said I believe you, Ani?

14:20.375 --> 14:21.208
Thank you.

15:06.541 --> 15:07.375


15:11.791 --> 15:14.708
Oh, it looks like a castle, TifAni.

15:15.208 --> 15:17.875
I always think they're gonna drive
nicer cars in the Main Line.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.583
It's such a hoity-toity area.

15:19.666 --> 15:20.625
Mom.

15:20.708 --> 15:21.875
Hmm.

15:21.958 --> 15:28.208
One hundred percent of the students
who received this writing scholarship…

15:28.291 --> 15:30.791
-Ended up at a tier-one university.
-…ended up…

15:30.875 --> 15:34.500
I know you think I'm a broken record,
but college is where you meet the people

15:34.583 --> 15:37.416
who are gonna be in your life
for a very long time, TifAni,

15:37.500 --> 15:40.250
and the caliber of men
is just not there at a state school.

15:40.333 --> 15:41.500
Okay, Mom.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.000
This is it. This is the beginning.

15:44.083 --> 15:45.208
Bye.

15:52.708 --> 15:54.875
You're already
the prettiest girl in school.

15:54.958 --> 15:56.041
Mom! Shh!

15:57.166 --> 16:01.250
♪ I don't think I like you much ♪

16:01.333 --> 16:04.958
♪ Heaven knows what a girl can do ♪

16:08.791 --> 16:10.750

16:11.416 --> 16:13.916
I spent the first few weeks
at the esteemed Brentley School

16:14.000 --> 16:15.791
navigating the various cliques.

16:16.416 --> 16:18.083
There were the popular kids…

16:18.583 --> 16:20.208
-Hi.

16:20.291 --> 16:21.458
…the smart kids,

16:21.541 --> 16:23.000
and everybody else.

16:23.833 --> 16:26.916
Plus the very cool teacher
who noticed my talent right away.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.791
"Holden is what we call
an unreliable narrator,

16:29.875 --> 16:33.375
someone whose version
of the truth can't be trusted."

16:33.916 --> 16:37.541
That's a line from the exceptional essay
by TifAni FaNelli.

16:37.625 --> 16:39.916
Welcome to Brentley. Congratulations.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.166
♪ She's a genius in a bottle, baby ♪

16:42.250 --> 16:43.250
-Stop.

16:46.833 --> 16:47.958
Oh, thanks.

16:53.250 --> 16:55.708
The one thing
they all had that I didn't?

16:56.416 --> 16:57.375
Pedigree.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.125
Yo, Hilary.

16:59.208 --> 17:01.375
-Yo, Dean.
-Get me some Swedish Fish.

17:10.708 --> 17:11.750
Oh.

17:12.250 --> 17:13.500
Don't worry, I got you.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.041
Uh… Don't use a tray.

17:18.625 --> 17:19.708
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

17:21.875 --> 17:22.708
Okay.

17:27.458 --> 17:29.000
Come on, come sit with us.

17:29.708 --> 17:31.125
Liam! Over here.

17:31.208 --> 17:32.458
Peyton, take that.

17:32.958 --> 17:34.458
-Hey, girl.
-Hey.

17:35.208 --> 17:38.625
-What's up, TifAni?
-Shit, homeboy's already called dibs.

17:38.708 --> 17:41.500
I showed her where the language room was
this morning, shitbrain.

17:43.541 --> 17:45.666
-What do I owe you, Finny?
-Finny?

17:45.750 --> 17:49.291
Tif-Finny.

17:49.375 --> 17:50.333
Don't worry about it.

17:50.416 --> 17:53.166
Only Dean would let a financial-aid kid
buy him lunch.

17:53.250 --> 17:54.083
Oh.

17:55.416 --> 17:56.791
It's a writing scholarship.

17:57.583 --> 17:59.958
That only low-income students
can apply for.

18:00.041 --> 18:00.875
Liv…

18:00.958 --> 18:07.208
Hmm. And yet, you're John D. Rockefeller's
great-great-great-granddaughter,

18:07.291 --> 18:10.458
and you still lost
the Salinger Essay Award to, uh--

18:10.541 --> 18:11.416
Okay.

18:11.500 --> 18:14.541
Uh, Olivia had to change her last name
from Rockefeller to Kaplan

18:14.625 --> 18:16.125
due to a kidnapping threat.

18:16.208 --> 18:20.625
-It's been a harrowing time for her.
-Jesus. Finny, watch out for this freak.

18:21.416 --> 18:24.500
Choke on your Swedish Fish, Dean.
You're such a dick.

18:29.791 --> 18:34.541
…gun control. And they equate it
with an effort to take away their guns.

18:34.625 --> 18:37.541
-
-And I used to be one of them, Rachel,

18:37.625 --> 18:40.083
until I realized that the bill
we are proposing

18:40.166 --> 18:42.125
wouldn't have threatened
my constitutional rights.

18:42.208 --> 18:45.291
But it would have ensured
that the gun that severed my spinal cord

18:45.375 --> 18:47.416
was registered,
locked away in a safe place,

18:47.500 --> 18:52.000
out of the hands of the dangerous,
mentally-unstable individuals that…

18:52.083 --> 18:53.208
Why are we watching this?

18:53.291 --> 18:55.166
We… We so appreciate you--

18:55.250 --> 18:57.000
That director reached out again.

18:57.083 --> 18:58.041
Oh.

18:59.166 --> 19:00.083
What does he want?

19:01.875 --> 19:03.541
Dean's doing the documentary now.

19:05.833 --> 19:06.958
Nice.

19:08.333 --> 19:10.541
It's a last-ditch effort
to get you to do it.

19:11.333 --> 19:13.916
You're the story. You're the one
who's never gone on record.

19:14.000 --> 19:14.958
He needs you.

19:18.958 --> 19:19.791
Hey.

19:22.750 --> 19:25.083
You should do it
if you feel you need to do it.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.958
But remember, you don't have to
defend yourself to me

19:29.041 --> 19:30.625
or to anyone who really knows you.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.875
Who cares what anyone else thinks?

19:33.958 --> 19:37.166
So easy to say
when everyone loves you, Luke.

19:37.250 --> 19:39.166
-Can I give you some good news?
-Yeah.

19:43.333 --> 19:45.625
They wanna make the London offer
attractive to both of us.

19:46.208 --> 19:48.458
Luke's firm wants to pay him
fuck-your-feelings-money

19:48.541 --> 19:49.500
to move to London,

19:50.166 --> 19:52.375
where I'll be barefoot
and pregnant in a year.

19:52.458 --> 19:55.833
John said this is ranked number six
globally when it comes to MFA programs.

19:55.916 --> 19:56.875
Come on, Luke.

19:57.708 --> 20:00.250
You know MFA programs
are just for white girls

20:00.333 --> 20:01.708
who can't get paid to write.

20:02.708 --> 20:04.125
I thought you'd be elated.

20:04.916 --> 20:10.041
It's just, um… LoLo mentioned today
that she's in the final stages

20:10.125 --> 20:13.333
of reviewing her contract
with The New York Times Magazine.

20:14.333 --> 20:17.458
I'm sorry, Ani,
but how many times have you heard this?

20:18.750 --> 20:21.500
Until there's an offer on the table,
none of it is real.

20:22.166 --> 20:23.083
London is real.

20:24.541 --> 20:27.333
This is a real opportunity for you.

20:30.916 --> 20:33.000
Okay, I'll think about it.

20:33.583 --> 20:35.916
-Think about it. Going for a run.
-Okay.

20:38.958 --> 20:40.625
Think of it as a fresh start, babe.

20:46.375 --> 20:47.500
This is so fun.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.750
-Go. You got it.
-All right. All right.

20:56.833 --> 20:57.791
Watch this.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.000
Oh my God.

21:01.208 --> 21:03.958
Liam is, like, doing
a mating dance or something.

21:05.041 --> 21:06.875
He is so yummy right now.

21:10.375 --> 21:11.583
Move your legs!

21:11.666 --> 21:13.541
Hey, yo, Peyton, watch this.

21:13.625 --> 21:17.958
-Oh! Oh! Hey! Oh.
-Okay.

21:18.541 --> 21:20.166
-Ah!
-What…

21:20.250 --> 21:21.750
-What the fuck?
-Relax.

21:21.833 --> 21:24.333
You're fucking weird.
Get the fuck away from me.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.000
-Relax, man.
-This fucking guy.

21:26.083 --> 21:27.458
-Come on.
-I'm gonna kill him.

21:27.541 --> 21:28.833
Ah!

21:28.916 --> 21:29.916
Hey.

21:30.458 --> 21:32.583
-He's so cute!

21:34.500 --> 21:37.000
Arthur, I think I might be pregnant.

21:37.083 --> 21:39.958
Oh, yeah. You guys' kids
are gonna need a fucking tutor.

21:40.458 --> 21:43.375
Why… Why do I feel like
you just did something ill-advised?

21:43.458 --> 21:45.541
Dude, you promised no horseshit tonight.

21:45.625 --> 21:48.041
Well, promises are meant
to be broken, mon chéri.

21:50.250 --> 21:51.250
Oh!

21:57.958 --> 22:00.208
He's got a flask. Let's go.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.875
-Oh, Arthur. Arthur. Arthur.
-Arthur.

22:04.958 --> 22:06.125
Arthur, stop.

22:06.208 --> 22:08.083
You need to come with me, now.

22:11.666 --> 22:12.541
Come with me.

22:13.833 --> 22:14.666
Hilary!

22:19.458 --> 22:21.000
-Come on.

22:21.625 --> 22:23.666
Don't stop. Don't stop.

22:24.208 --> 22:28.291
Girls. If you leave school property,
I have to call your parents.

22:28.375 --> 22:30.000
My mom knows I'm going to Dean's house.

22:30.083 --> 22:32.458
I mean, she's best friends
with Mrs. Barton.

22:32.541 --> 22:34.250
-Yeah.
-Tiff's sleeping over after.

22:35.208 --> 22:37.708
-Call Hilary's mom if you want.
-Yeah.

22:38.291 --> 22:39.375
Yeah, call my mom.

22:43.250 --> 22:44.750
-Okay.

22:48.000 --> 22:48.833
Yes, I'm here.

22:48.916 --> 22:50.833
Go, go, go. Come on.

22:50.916 --> 22:52.541
-Hey!

22:52.625 --> 22:53.458
Hi!

22:55.458 --> 22:57.125
-Hi, Mr. Larson!
-No, don't!

22:57.208 --> 22:58.208
-Don't do that!
-Thank you!

22:58.291 --> 22:59.458
He's gonna call my mom.

22:59.541 --> 23:01.250
-I love this song!

23:07.666 --> 23:09.708
Halter is a good style for her.

23:10.208 --> 23:11.666
She can wear anything.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.958
Even with the breast reduction,
she's still broad in the shoulders.

23:24.250 --> 23:25.541
Wow.

23:26.041 --> 23:27.333
Marry me.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.958
Mmm.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.375
What about a belt?

23:35.458 --> 23:38.833
You just need some embellishments
or something 'cause it's so plain.

23:40.166 --> 23:42.208
If you just would've waited
five more seconds,

23:42.291 --> 23:45.583
you wouldn't have had to insult my dress.

23:45.666 --> 23:49.666
I did not insult her dress.
Did you hear me insult her dress?

23:49.750 --> 23:51.458
You just want her popping.

23:51.541 --> 23:52.791
Nell gets it.

23:52.875 --> 23:56.041
I was watching
Say Yes to the Dress the other day,

23:56.541 --> 23:58.250
and the girl on there

23:58.333 --> 24:04.583
had, um, this tulle princess skirt
you could tie on or tie off.

24:05.875 --> 24:09.166
Kate Middleton didn't wear a tulle
princess skirt to her wedding.

24:09.250 --> 24:11.708
Neither should the expecting
child brides of Ohio.

24:13.083 --> 24:14.000
Thank you.

24:14.791 --> 24:16.625
Yes, she was about six months along.

24:16.708 --> 24:17.708
-Mmm.

24:19.125 --> 24:22.791
Still, I think I would do that over this,
um… The bolerino thing.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.375
Bolero.

24:25.916 --> 24:26.916
Bolero.

24:27.666 --> 24:28.708
Have another.

24:29.541 --> 24:30.375
Ani.

24:32.125 --> 24:35.333
Excuse me for trying to celebrate
the most important day of your life.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.125
I'm gonna go check out the sales upstairs.

24:38.208 --> 24:41.583
I'm afraid you can't bring glass
outside the bridal boutique, ma'am.

24:46.750 --> 24:51.000
Okay, don't kill me,
but I sort of agree with her.

24:51.083 --> 24:53.666
I mean, you're sexier than this, right?

24:55.291 --> 24:57.666
I'm getting married
in the whale print capital of the world.

24:57.750 --> 25:01.500
I don't wanna embarrass Luke
in some sequined mermaid dress.

25:01.583 --> 25:04.791
Embarrass Luke?
Ugh! Fucking yikes, Ani.

25:05.833 --> 25:07.541
Nell, I'm… I'm five weeks out.

25:07.625 --> 25:10.000
Why would you tell me
that my dress is wrong now?

25:10.083 --> 25:12.291
No, it's not wrong. Okay?
Nothing about you is wrong.

25:12.375 --> 25:15.625
Jesus. Unclench, okay?

25:15.708 --> 25:17.166
Yeah, well, that's impossible,

25:17.250 --> 25:19.541
what with the real housewife
of Pennsyltucky in town.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.250
Be nice to your mother.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.375
That cut looks nice on you.

25:26.958 --> 25:29.791
More forgiving across the middle
than some of your other stuff.

25:32.916 --> 25:33.750
Whoa!

25:34.250 --> 25:35.583
It's the director. It's Aaron.

25:36.083 --> 25:37.750
-Let it go to voicemail.

25:41.208 --> 25:43.791
I thought you told him no.
Why is he calling you?

25:43.875 --> 25:45.375
I did,

25:46.083 --> 25:49.708
but I just wanted to know
if I change my mind,

25:50.541 --> 25:52.875
when I would need to be available.

25:52.958 --> 25:55.125
Holy shit.

25:56.583 --> 25:59.000
-Ani.
-Like, good "shit"?

26:00.125 --> 26:05.166
Babe, you wanna expose Dean Barton
for the sanctimonious prick that he is.

26:06.250 --> 26:09.416
This is no-dairy-for-a-month shit.

26:10.625 --> 26:11.708
Single-wipe shit.

26:12.625 --> 26:16.625
No. Uh, I don't know. I, um…
I'm not ready.

26:17.208 --> 26:19.041
-Come on, what will it take?
-Oh.

26:19.708 --> 26:22.750
Let's see. Uh, Dean's making
viral speeches at Congress,

26:22.833 --> 26:26.208
and I have a story due Monday about how to
pleasure an uncircumcised penis.

26:26.291 --> 26:28.708
They're more sensitive
than the ones without their turtlenecks,

26:28.791 --> 26:29.958
according to the experts.

26:30.500 --> 26:31.875
Nobody believed me back then,

26:31.958 --> 26:34.208
because I was
a Wet Seal wearing gutter rat.

26:34.708 --> 26:37.541
If I'm gonna do this,
I need to be bulletproof.

26:37.625 --> 26:41.041
I need to be able to say
that I work at The New York Times,

26:41.125 --> 26:44.333
that I live in an elevator
doorman building in Tribeca,

26:44.416 --> 26:45.875
and that my name is Ani Harrison

26:45.958 --> 26:48.291
because I married
the lacrosse captain of Nantucket.

26:48.375 --> 26:51.166
And how dare anyone believe
I did what Dean said I did

26:51.250 --> 26:54.250
while wiping away a single tear
with this hand in particular.

26:58.125 --> 26:59.291
Four out of five.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.916
Not that you need any of it
to make you credible.

27:05.458 --> 27:06.375
You don't,

27:07.666 --> 27:08.541
but I do.

27:10.791 --> 27:11.750
I do.

27:17.458 --> 27:20.541
My God, they have attitude in here.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.375
It's like, you work retail.

27:25.625 --> 27:27.583
-I'm gonna make a quick call.
-Okay.

27:28.083 --> 27:29.750
-You're fine.
-Oh, thank you.

27:33.250 --> 27:34.666
Sucker's a hall pass.

27:37.416 --> 27:39.166
Hi, Ani. I'm so glad you called.

27:39.250 --> 27:42.125
I didn't feel good about
the way we ended things in your office.

27:42.208 --> 27:45.583
The new headmaster's allowing us to film
on campus the second week of September.

27:45.666 --> 27:48.291
We're just finalizing the schedule.
We'd love to know if you're in.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.708
-Oh, cute, Spencer.
-Call me back when you get a chance.

27:51.791 --> 27:54.875
Oh, excuse me.
You look exactly like my daughter.

27:55.875 --> 27:58.625
Uh, people are always mistaking me
for someone else.

27:59.416 --> 28:00.708
While I have you…

28:02.333 --> 28:03.791
-That one.
-Hmm.

28:04.791 --> 28:05.666
Nice eye.

28:22.750 --> 28:23.625
Hi, Aaron?

28:25.333 --> 28:27.833
I always stay at the Ritz Carlton
when I come home.

28:30.666 --> 28:31.500
Great.

29:13.500 --> 29:14.458
Baby, here we go!

29:15.333 --> 29:16.791
-Oh!

29:22.416 --> 29:23.583
Shots!

29:24.708 --> 29:25.875
Come on!

29:25.958 --> 29:27.583
-Cheers!

29:27.666 --> 29:29.208
Oh, yeah!

29:29.916 --> 29:31.541
I'll take that one too.

29:32.166 --> 29:33.791
-All right, let's go.
-Hilary.

29:33.875 --> 29:35.083
Hilary, your mom's here.

29:35.166 --> 29:37.166
-My mom's here. Fuck, my mom's here!
-What?

29:37.250 --> 29:38.416
We have to go.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.125
What? I've got to go.

29:40.625 --> 29:42.625
-Tif, are you coming?
-You can't have her.

29:42.708 --> 29:44.333
I'm sorry, you can't have her!

29:46.083 --> 29:46.958
Tif!

29:48.875 --> 29:50.458
He won't let me go.

29:50.541 --> 29:52.583
Finny, drink! Let's go.

29:52.666 --> 29:55.458
Come on! My house, my rules.

29:55.541 --> 29:56.791
Ani?

30:14.333 --> 30:15.375
Fucking corporate.

30:15.458 --> 30:19.625
Okay, the latest edict is
we can't say clit, but clitoris is fine.

30:19.708 --> 30:20.583
Okay.

30:21.916 --> 30:25.916
Oh, but you don't need to know that,
because you no longer work here.

30:28.333 --> 30:30.125
We're going to The New York Times.

30:30.208 --> 30:33.083
Oh, fuck yes! Yeah!

30:33.166 --> 30:34.000
Whoo!

30:35.833 --> 30:36.833
Thank you.

30:39.083 --> 30:43.166
Hi.
Reservation for four for Harrison.

30:43.250 --> 30:44.708
Should be eight o'clock.

30:49.708 --> 30:50.750
-Hey.

30:50.833 --> 30:51.750
Hi.

30:52.791 --> 30:55.541
-You're in a good mood.
-Okay, so I have some good news.

30:55.625 --> 30:57.833
-One member of your party is at the bar.
-Oh.

30:57.916 --> 30:59.750
Okay, I'll, um… I'll tell you after.

30:59.833 --> 31:01.708
Here you go. Thank you so much.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.666
That's her. That's-- That's the wife.

31:09.083 --> 31:10.041
Whitney.

31:10.125 --> 31:11.791
-Luke. Hi.
-Good to see ya.

31:11.875 --> 31:14.208
Mm. Andrew's running a few minutes late.

31:14.291 --> 31:16.083
-This is Ani, my fiancée.
-Hi, Whitney.

31:16.166 --> 31:18.000
-Nice to meet you.

31:19.291 --> 31:23.125
Excuse me, but I have been stuck at home
with a 16-month-old.

31:23.708 --> 31:25.416
A 16-month-old?

31:26.166 --> 31:27.916
You look amazing.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.500
Luke calls me the wife-whisperer.

31:29.583 --> 31:30.833
Do you have any photos?

31:30.916 --> 31:32.083
Like it's so hard.

31:32.583 --> 31:34.916
Literally, all you do is act like
they invented motherhood.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.541
Scroll to the right.

31:36.625 --> 31:39.125
There's a special place in hell
for women who can't show you

31:39.208 --> 31:41.083
just one picture of their children.

31:41.166 --> 31:43.875
Oh my God, come on.
Look at this little munchkin.

31:43.958 --> 31:46.416
-Baby, look at it.
-Cute. Can I have a beer, please?

31:49.958 --> 31:51.375
Is this your husband?

31:52.583 --> 31:54.125
As far as I know.

31:54.208 --> 31:56.750
Sorry. My God, 5th was a parking lot.

31:57.541 --> 31:58.958
-There he is.
-Luke.

31:59.791 --> 32:01.333
-Good to see ya.
-Great to see ya.

32:01.416 --> 32:02.583
-Honey.
-Hey.

32:03.208 --> 32:04.041
This is Ani.

32:04.541 --> 32:06.333
Nice to meet you. Andrew.

32:07.666 --> 32:09.208
Mr. Larson, it's me.

32:10.500 --> 32:11.333
TifAni.

32:11.916 --> 32:12.791
TifAni?

32:14.666 --> 32:17.958
Uh, "Mr. Larson?"
Was he your teacher?

32:18.458 --> 32:19.625
TifAni.

32:20.291 --> 32:24.375
Uh… I didn't recognize you. You look…

32:25.041 --> 32:27.416
Like none of it ever happened.

32:27.500 --> 32:28.708
We can seat you now.

32:30.666 --> 32:33.958
So… I'm sorry, wait a second.
Did you change your name or--

32:34.041 --> 32:37.416
No, this is, um, TifAni,
from when I left Brentley.

32:38.000 --> 32:38.875
Oh.

32:38.958 --> 32:39.958
Oh God.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.666
-God, I'm so sorry for…
-Oh God.

32:41.750 --> 32:43.708
-You know, everything.
-It's okay.

32:44.291 --> 32:47.208
-What happened to you, I just--
-Oh, I understand.

32:47.291 --> 32:48.708
Make it stop, Luke.

32:48.791 --> 32:50.500
I'm so sorry. I…

32:51.541 --> 32:53.458
Well, if it's any consolation,

32:53.541 --> 32:58.000
thanks to you, my do-gooder husband
got into credit derivatives.

33:00.500 --> 33:03.416
You know, TifAni
was the strongest writer in my class.

33:03.500 --> 33:05.666
Well, now she's senior editor
at The Women's Bible.

33:05.750 --> 33:08.083
-The Women's Bible?
-Yeah.

33:08.166 --> 33:09.791
-That's fantastic.
-Thank you.

33:09.875 --> 33:12.333
I used to have to hide that
from my mother growing up.

33:12.416 --> 33:16.041
"The past is never dead.
It's not even past."

33:16.916 --> 33:18.541
To what Confucius said.

33:18.625 --> 33:20.666
Huh, Faulkner.

33:20.750 --> 33:22.208
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

33:23.375 --> 33:24.458
Cheers.

33:25.083 --> 33:28.250
Mmm. So, Ani, you have to tell us,

33:28.333 --> 33:31.083
what do you think of the director
in the skinny jeans?

33:34.708 --> 33:37.791
-You're doing the documentary?
-They got to you too, huh?

33:42.583 --> 33:44.000
Please tell me you are.

33:48.083 --> 33:48.916
Yeah.

33:49.708 --> 33:51.500
It's long overdue.

33:51.583 --> 33:53.208
Thankfully, the timing worked out.

33:53.708 --> 33:56.041
We might be moving to London
after the wedding.

33:56.125 --> 33:57.791
-London?
-Yeah.

33:58.541 --> 34:01.666
Luke has been asked to run
BlackRock's European desk.

34:01.750 --> 34:04.458
-Luke, congratulations.
-Thank you.

34:04.541 --> 34:06.833
-Exciting.
-We're still figuring out the details.

34:07.333 --> 34:10.750
Will you be able to write
for the magazine from over there?

34:12.208 --> 34:16.500
Actually, I… just got accepted

34:16.583 --> 34:19.458
into the Goldsmith's MFA program

34:19.541 --> 34:21.333
-at the University of London.
-Ah!

34:21.416 --> 34:22.791
To teach, I hope.

34:22.875 --> 34:24.000
-Oh!
-Oh!

34:24.083 --> 34:27.291
-Ugh! Enough, Mr. Larson.

34:28.666 --> 34:30.875
Sometimes I feel
like a wind-up doll.

34:30.958 --> 34:34.083
Turn my key, and I'll tell you
exactly what you wanna hear.

34:52.875 --> 34:55.041
For someone who so easily could,

34:55.125 --> 34:58.291
Mr. Larson has never once
made me feel ashamed.

35:05.958 --> 35:06.916
Hey.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.250
Our spouses went to 7th to get a cab.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.375
-Can I tell you something?
-Sure.

35:14.208 --> 35:17.166
I got a job offer
from The New York Times Magazine today.

35:17.750 --> 35:18.708
Brava.

35:20.375 --> 35:23.875
I mean, I had nothing to do with it,
but I couldn't be more proud.

35:24.458 --> 35:25.458
Thanks.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.916
What about London and the MFA?

35:31.541 --> 35:32.666
I'll figure it out.

35:34.041 --> 35:37.958
Tif, I know how these things usually go.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.083
Don't acquiesce.

35:42.583 --> 35:46.291
-I'm glad you're doing the doc.
-It's a balancing act with him.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.708
He doesn't trust
the director in skinny jeans.

35:52.375 --> 35:53.458
So you acquiesce?

35:55.875 --> 35:57.500
Am I allowed to call you a bastard now?

35:57.583 --> 35:59.875
You should be allowed
to do anything you want.

36:03.333 --> 36:04.625
Okay.

36:04.708 --> 36:06.125
It was good to see you.

36:20.833 --> 36:22.416
Hey, man, is the AC on?

36:23.875 --> 36:25.708
Should be getting colder now.

36:29.041 --> 36:31.541
Did you mean
what you said back there about London?

36:39.750 --> 36:43.125
You know, sometimes I feel like
another box you have to check off

36:43.208 --> 36:45.208
so you look like you've done okay.

36:49.250 --> 36:51.500
I'm not some prick
who doesn't respect your career

36:51.583 --> 36:53.500
just because you don't make
as much money as I do.

36:53.583 --> 36:55.291
-You know that, right?

36:57.166 --> 37:00.125
I think you are so talented
and so creative,

37:00.208 --> 37:01.625
and I love that about you.

37:04.125 --> 37:06.083
It's one of the reasons
I want us to go to London.

37:06.166 --> 37:10.083
I think you are limited where you are,
and frankly, you're better than it.

37:10.916 --> 37:13.458
All I have to show
for the past nine years of my career

37:13.541 --> 37:15.666
is 15,000 ways to touch a cock.

37:16.208 --> 37:18.375
I never would've gotten the offer
from The New York Times

37:18.458 --> 37:20.083
if LoLo hadn't grandfathered me in.

37:20.166 --> 37:21.291
You got the offer?

37:21.375 --> 37:22.250
Yeah.

37:25.250 --> 37:26.750
What is it? Where is it?

37:31.750 --> 37:32.666
Is this right?

37:34.083 --> 37:36.250
-Yeah.
-It's not even a 10% raise.

37:36.333 --> 37:39.166
It's The New York Times.
I wouldn't be going there for the money.

37:39.250 --> 37:41.416
Well, this makes me think
they don't value you at all.

37:41.500 --> 37:44.958
It's not personal. There's no money
left in publishing anymore.

37:45.041 --> 37:46.875
Well, exactly.

37:46.958 --> 37:49.958
Listen, you go to London and get your MFA.
You can write a book.

37:50.041 --> 37:52.208
Something that's yours,
that you have equity in.

37:52.791 --> 37:55.125
Wouldn't you rather be known
for something you've created

37:55.208 --> 37:57.625
than this thing
that happened to you so long ago?

37:59.916 --> 38:00.791
No.

38:01.583 --> 38:05.500
No, I… I wanna be remembered
for what really happened to me.

38:05.583 --> 38:08.333
I want vindication.
It's all I think about.

38:08.416 --> 38:10.625
I know you've thought long and hard
about doing this documentary,

38:10.708 --> 38:12.208
and I'm not saying you shouldn't do it,

38:12.291 --> 38:15.958
but Dean has taken this very bad thing
that happened to him

38:16.041 --> 38:19.416
and done something good with it.
People respect that and they respect him.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.166
You know what I'm saying.

38:23.333 --> 38:24.166
Yeah.

38:25.041 --> 38:28.250
Yeah, it's the blow-job editor
versus the gun-safety savior.

38:29.250 --> 38:31.166
No, God, of course. Ugh!

38:31.250 --> 38:35.000
Oh God, if there was just a way for me
to write about more important issues

38:35.083 --> 38:37.416
for a place of worldwide
influence and acclaim,

38:37.500 --> 38:39.750
then maybe, just maybe,

38:39.833 --> 38:42.250
people can hold me
in the same esteem as Dean.

38:42.333 --> 38:46.666
Gosh, if there was just a way
for me to work at this elusive place.

38:46.750 --> 38:49.125
You're so angry. I can't talk to you
when you're this angry.

38:49.208 --> 38:51.416
Ugh! It's so hot in here.

38:52.833 --> 38:55.666
I'm gonna walk the last few blocks.

38:59.791 --> 39:01.958
Sir, can you please
just keep driving?

39:38.666 --> 39:39.916
Shit, Peyton.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.625
Yo, holy fuck, you're still at it?
What the…

39:43.708 --> 39:45.250
Fuck off, Liam.

39:55.041 --> 39:56.416
We'll hang out, okay?

40:06.458 --> 40:07.833
What the fuck?

40:09.375 --> 40:11.416
Oh my God, I can't watch.

40:11.500 --> 40:13.000
Come on, someone do something.

40:13.083 --> 40:14.458
No, that's you, buddy.

40:21.583 --> 40:23.416
Aw. Holy fuck.

40:23.500 --> 40:24.458
Shit.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.916
Take care of your girl, Liam.

40:29.583 --> 40:30.458
Hey.

40:31.416 --> 40:33.416
-Aw.

40:35.250 --> 40:38.250
Hey. Come on, I got you.

40:47.333 --> 40:49.458
-Ow! Ow…

40:53.708 --> 40:55.791
Ow!

41:06.166 --> 41:08.166
Ow!

42:12.083 --> 42:13.583
Hi. Um, Dean…

42:13.666 --> 42:15.291
-I just really need some water.
-You…

42:15.375 --> 42:16.958
You should really get some sleep.

42:17.041 --> 42:18.750
Yeah, I'm just really thirsty.

42:19.333 --> 42:21.000
Uh… Dean!

42:21.083 --> 42:22.208
Wait, stop!

42:22.291 --> 42:25.083
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

42:25.166 --> 42:27.500
Stop! Stop! Stop! Wait. Wait.

42:27.583 --> 42:29.916
Dean, wait. Stop! Stop!
Stop! Please.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.166
Stop! Stop! Wait! Wait, no!

42:32.250 --> 42:35.000
Please! Please!

42:35.083 --> 42:37.083
Please, stop! Stop!

42:48.791 --> 42:50.500
-Oh, fuck!

42:52.083 --> 42:54.125
-Motherfucker.

42:54.875 --> 42:55.833
Finny!

42:56.791 --> 42:57.708
Shit.

42:58.333 --> 42:59.625
Finny.

42:59.708 --> 43:02.041
Fuck! Fucking crazy ass bitch! Get out!

43:02.125 --> 43:05.500
-Hot in here! Fucking piece of shit! Agh!

43:05.583 --> 43:08.041
What the fuck?
Fucking ass bitch! Get out!

43:08.125 --> 43:09.916
-Get her out!
-Honey, get out!

43:10.000 --> 43:12.083
Don't fucking touch me!

43:12.166 --> 43:13.416
Fuck you!

43:13.500 --> 43:15.041
Don't fucking touch me!

43:17.833 --> 43:19.333
You're so fucking nuts.

43:47.916 --> 43:49.083
Excuse me.

43:50.375 --> 43:52.916
Do you know how to get
to the Brentley School from here?

43:53.416 --> 43:54.250
TifAni?

44:02.833 --> 44:04.666
Hey. Hey.

44:04.750 --> 44:06.750
-Hey. What happened?

44:07.583 --> 44:08.791
Hey, what happened?

44:11.083 --> 44:12.541
TifAni, what happened?

44:59.083 --> 45:00.041
You can come in.

45:02.875 --> 45:04.833
They're a little big but they're clean.

45:09.833 --> 45:11.166
Look, can I please,

45:11.750 --> 45:13.875
please take you to the hospital now?

45:21.416 --> 45:23.041
-I gotta call your mother.
-No.

45:29.125 --> 45:31.458
Look, you… you can't be here.

45:31.958 --> 45:33.166
It-- it's not…

45:37.000 --> 45:38.916
Look, I can get into a lot of trouble.

46:05.666 --> 46:06.791
Thanks.

46:07.833 --> 46:09.416
Dean is hoping to meet with you.

46:10.583 --> 46:11.666
No fucking way.

46:11.750 --> 46:13.083
-Just hear me out.
-No.

46:13.166 --> 46:15.833
He's willing to take back his claim
that you're involved in the shooting.

46:15.916 --> 46:17.750
He's going to vindicate you, Ani.

46:18.333 --> 46:21.208
He wants to sit down with you
on camera and apologize.

46:21.291 --> 46:24.083
Ugh. I hate your soft voice so much.

46:25.291 --> 46:26.375
Sorry. Um…

46:28.083 --> 46:28.916
What--

46:29.708 --> 46:30.583
Why?

46:31.583 --> 46:33.583
Maybe you have some sense?

46:33.666 --> 46:37.041
For fuck's sake, will you just
put this guy out of his misery?

46:38.625 --> 46:40.041
My money's on the gang rape.

46:43.541 --> 46:46.500
There. I said it. No going back now.

46:46.583 --> 46:49.000
I've gathered enough
to know that that event

46:49.083 --> 46:51.708
was framed as something
that you participated in. I'm…

46:52.208 --> 46:54.125
I'm so sorry, Ani. It makes me sick.

46:54.208 --> 46:57.750
Yeah, no participation trophy for me.

46:57.833 --> 47:00.166
TifAni… Uh, I mean, Ani,

47:01.250 --> 47:02.333
if you wanna do this,

47:02.416 --> 47:04.958
it'd be easy enough to tack on
an extra day to the schedule.

47:05.041 --> 47:08.083
I'll make sure to keep you both separate
until you give me permission.

47:08.166 --> 47:09.458
You'll call the shots.

47:10.833 --> 47:14.250
What's the point of being at your
fighting weight if you're not gonna fight?

47:15.583 --> 47:16.458
Okay.

47:25.541 --> 47:27.916
And your safety and comfort
is our highest priority.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.208
We do not wanna see you re-traumatized.

47:30.958 --> 47:32.916
We could look into getting you
a victims' advocate.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.291
Sorry. I should probably ask
if you prefer "survivor" to "victim."

47:36.375 --> 47:38.708
-I know that's a big thing these days.
-Oh.

47:39.458 --> 47:41.250
Survivor? Gross.

47:43.208 --> 47:44.791
So victim then?

47:44.875 --> 47:45.750
Yeah.

47:47.458 --> 47:48.291
Victim.

48:09.958 --> 48:10.791
Mmm.

48:11.750 --> 48:13.000
Definitely this one.

48:13.500 --> 48:16.208
It's less oaky. I hate oak.

48:16.291 --> 48:19.541
Hmm. Gosh, Mom.
I never once wondered if I was adopted.

48:24.750 --> 48:28.416
Did you know it's broo-sket-ta,
not broo-shet-ta?

48:28.500 --> 48:31.833
TifAni taught me that.
She and Nell lived in Rome for a time.

48:31.916 --> 48:34.000
-Keep it cute, FaNelli.

48:34.083 --> 48:36.625
That must have been
a wonderful experience for you girls.

48:36.708 --> 48:38.416
Oh, I just love Italy.

48:38.500 --> 48:40.583
And from London,
it's just such a short flight.

48:40.666 --> 48:41.500
Oh!

48:43.166 --> 48:46.083
You didn't tell me.
You made a decision about London?

48:46.166 --> 48:48.583
Mom, no, we didn't make
a decision yet, remember?

48:49.083 --> 48:51.791
-Oh, I apologize. I misunderstood.

48:55.958 --> 48:56.833
Uh, um…

48:59.208 --> 49:00.791
I'll be… I'll be just a minute.

49:03.083 --> 49:03.958
Okay.

49:11.875 --> 49:14.041
-This is nice. Cheers.

49:15.125 --> 49:17.875
And now here to comment is Dean Barton.

49:17.958 --> 49:20.291
Every day that Congress
fails to work together

49:20.375 --> 49:22.500
to create universal background checks

49:22.583 --> 49:24.916
is another day
that a student risks their life

49:25.000 --> 49:26.541
just trying to get an education.

49:27.041 --> 49:27.875
TifAni?

49:27.958 --> 49:29.333
It's outright negligence.

49:29.833 --> 49:30.708
What are you doing?

49:30.791 --> 49:33.250
-We owe these kids so much more.
-I came to check on you.

49:33.333 --> 49:34.166
Why?

49:43.083 --> 49:44.333
My little bambina.

49:45.125 --> 49:47.500
Really starting to freak out
about seeing Dean.

49:47.583 --> 49:48.416
Right.

49:49.000 --> 49:52.291
What if when I see him in a wheelchair,
I can't be angry anymore?

49:53.583 --> 49:55.041
I don't wanna feel bad for him.

49:55.125 --> 49:57.250
It's so much cleaner
if I could just hate him.

49:58.375 --> 49:59.208
Oh.

50:02.083 --> 50:06.208
I say we go out there
and get Drunken Ship-faced.

50:06.291 --> 50:07.166
Hmm?

50:10.583 --> 50:14.083
Come on. You're about
to read Dean Barton for fucking filth.

50:14.166 --> 50:16.083
Where's the registry for that?

50:16.166 --> 50:18.083
Where's the blushing bride?

50:19.708 --> 50:21.958
Jesus Christ,
how am I gonna get through this?

50:24.416 --> 50:27.000
Here comes the bride. Finally.

50:27.083 --> 50:28.833
Hey, lady. Oh…

50:29.791 --> 50:32.625
Hallsy's Luke's
poorly preserved aunt

50:32.708 --> 50:36.291
who ceased to be a lady
20 tennis-pro dicks ago.

50:36.375 --> 50:38.708
Why is everyone so anti-oak these days?

50:40.583 --> 50:42.875
Ooh! I have a buttery chard just for you.

50:42.958 --> 50:45.333
About the only thing
California's good for.

50:45.416 --> 50:48.875
And do me one more solid,
don't sit me with the Gilmartins.

50:49.666 --> 50:51.875
-What'd you do this time?
-I didn't do anything.

50:51.958 --> 50:54.291
They're being snowflakes
over the new park.

50:54.375 --> 50:55.458
No offense, you two.

50:55.541 --> 50:57.958
Well, it will be very loud for them.

50:58.041 --> 51:00.416
They've agreed to put in
soundproof buffers.

51:00.500 --> 51:02.833
What kind of a park
needs a soundproof buffer?

51:03.416 --> 51:04.833
A shooting park, Dinah.

51:05.958 --> 51:09.041
Can't blame gun owners for wanting
to enjoy their hobby responsibly.

51:09.125 --> 51:11.750
As a woman, I feel more empowered
when I'm shooting a gun

51:11.833 --> 51:14.166
than I do bitching
about every little thing.

51:14.250 --> 51:17.500
Okay, I'm gonna go inside.
Would anybody like some water?

51:17.583 --> 51:19.208
I'll take one. No ice.

51:20.041 --> 51:22.875
Don't worry,
I won't sit you with the Gilmartins.

51:22.958 --> 51:23.916
You'll be at table 12

51:24.000 --> 51:26.625
with the rest of the flabby cougars
where you belong.

51:28.208 --> 51:30.041
-TifAni.
-Oh, boy.

51:30.125 --> 51:31.333
Oh my God.

51:33.041 --> 51:34.125
Oh fuck.

51:45.500 --> 51:46.375
She's…

51:47.625 --> 51:48.625
She's really tired.

51:49.458 --> 51:51.000
It's been a long week, so…

51:56.875 --> 51:57.708
Ani!

51:58.958 --> 51:59.791
Stop!

52:01.916 --> 52:02.750
Ani.

52:03.458 --> 52:05.208
Ow! Goddamn it!

52:08.750 --> 52:09.708
Ani!

52:10.791 --> 52:11.791
Stop!

52:13.625 --> 52:14.500
Damn it.

52:20.541 --> 52:22.250
Do you like your life, TifAni?

52:22.333 --> 52:25.833
Yes, Mom, I have built
a very nice life for myself.

52:26.458 --> 52:28.041
How much do you make in a year?

52:28.833 --> 52:29.916
What?

52:30.000 --> 52:32.250
How much do you make in a year, honey?

52:35.333 --> 52:36.833
Uh… 80K.

52:36.916 --> 52:41.625
Sometimes a little bit more
if I guest-edit a brand extension, okay?

52:41.708 --> 52:44.166
Okay, so let's be generous.
Let's call it 90K.

52:44.708 --> 52:46.166
How much did you pay for that watch?

52:46.250 --> 52:48.125
You don't think I noticed
you got the Cartier?

52:48.958 --> 52:52.166
Don't you know it's gauche to ask
how much something costs, Mom?

52:52.250 --> 52:56.041
Oh, I know. I know you'd think
I didn't do anything with my life.

52:56.833 --> 53:01.125
But you know, when you're spending
$1,500 a month to exercise,

53:01.666 --> 53:04.791
and your mortgage is $12,000…

53:05.791 --> 53:11.958
This 90k that I was able to squirrel away
from alimony payments

53:12.041 --> 53:16.000
so I could stay home with you
and not have to pay for childcare?

53:16.083 --> 53:17.666
I put that money towards your education,

53:17.750 --> 53:20.375
and that put you in rooms
where you met a guy like Luke.

53:21.208 --> 53:24.625
And I am… I am doing my best here

53:24.708 --> 53:27.416
to try to connect with the Harrisons.
It's not easy.

53:28.750 --> 53:30.333
And now with this documentary?

53:31.333 --> 53:33.458
-What's that have to do with this?
-Everything.

53:33.541 --> 53:35.208
Everything, TifAni. Everything.

53:35.291 --> 53:38.583
You think you're embarrassed of me now,
don't try to say that you're not,

53:39.500 --> 53:42.458
imagine what it's gonna be like
when they find out about what happened.

53:43.750 --> 53:45.291
They had boys.

53:45.375 --> 53:47.791
They didn't have a girl
who developed early

53:47.875 --> 53:50.000
and was hell-bent on taking risks.

53:51.625 --> 53:53.541
They can't imagine what that was like.

53:54.500 --> 53:57.875
I did everything in my power
to protect you.

53:57.958 --> 53:59.416
I did. I did.

53:59.500 --> 54:02.041
That's why I had
all those rules in place that I did.

54:02.125 --> 54:04.208
But you didn't wanna follow those.

54:04.291 --> 54:05.875
That was your choice.

54:07.041 --> 54:08.416
So fine, you know?

54:08.500 --> 54:09.875
Just-- just-- just…

54:09.958 --> 54:12.750
At least just leave my name out of it.

54:14.291 --> 54:17.000
I did what any half-decent mother
would have done.

54:17.583 --> 54:18.458
I did.

54:18.958 --> 54:20.833
You'll find out someday.

54:21.708 --> 54:23.541
You'll find out how hard it is.

54:25.458 --> 54:26.416
Okay.

54:27.083 --> 54:29.833
Although if you keep pushing Luke away,
maybe you won't.

54:30.500 --> 54:33.458
At the very least, you won't have
someone else's pile of money to stand on

54:33.541 --> 54:35.166
while you call me gauche.

54:36.916 --> 54:37.833
Excuse me.

54:43.791 --> 54:44.625
TifAni.

54:46.916 --> 54:47.791
Wait.

55:01.375 --> 55:02.458
I'm sorry.

55:15.458 --> 55:17.375
My mom asked me what a cougar is.

55:43.125 --> 55:44.958
-Ah!

55:51.250 --> 55:52.500
-Okay.

55:53.875 --> 55:54.916
-Ow!

55:57.000 --> 55:58.291
-Babe?
-Yeah?

56:00.958 --> 56:03.041
Can we just do it the nice way?

56:05.250 --> 56:06.166
Yeah.

56:27.250 --> 56:28.166
Okay.

56:29.916 --> 56:30.916
Okay.

56:31.541 --> 56:33.291
I can't do this. Please get off me.

56:33.791 --> 56:36.166
Please just get off of me.
I'm sorry. I can't…

56:38.833 --> 56:39.750
Oh my God.

56:52.750 --> 56:54.333
I may not say everything right,

56:54.416 --> 56:59.083
but when I try to be respectful,
it's like you can't handle it.

57:08.583 --> 57:09.833
Thanks for taking me.

57:13.541 --> 57:15.291
You only have a 30% chance
of getting pregnant,

57:15.375 --> 57:17.125
but it's good to be on the safe side.

57:18.125 --> 57:18.958
Oh.

57:19.666 --> 57:20.875
Never heard that before.

57:37.041 --> 57:38.041
Liam?

57:39.000 --> 57:42.416
I just wanted you to know, I didn't mean
to hook up with anybody else.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Dude, it's no big deal.

57:51.041 --> 57:52.375
But I also feel like…

57:54.500 --> 57:55.958
I think I was raped.

58:00.666 --> 58:01.750
Are you insane?

58:04.625 --> 58:06.166
Are you actually insane? Like…

58:08.458 --> 58:10.500
Do you even know what rape is?

58:18.250 --> 58:19.666
Why would you even say that to me?

58:19.750 --> 58:23.125
I'm sorry.
I… I don't think that about you.

58:23.208 --> 58:25.083
-Finny!
-There she is.

58:27.208 --> 58:30.333
Finny, if I'm still hungover,
you're definitely still hungover.

58:30.416 --> 58:32.416
Hey, come on,
come on, come on. Let's go.

58:33.166 --> 58:34.166
Milady.

58:37.625 --> 58:39.708
You are an animal, FaNelli.

58:39.791 --> 58:42.791
Hey, you two… gotta step it up.

58:42.875 --> 58:44.750
-You are such a loser.
-Loser?

58:44.833 --> 58:47.625
-I think that was your job last night.
-Did you win any games at all?

58:47.708 --> 58:50.250
-Yeah, I won two. Yeah.
-I don't think so.

58:50.333 --> 58:53.583
I mean, if I'd lost as much as you had,
then I would have left long ago.

58:54.333 --> 58:55.833
Oh, come on.

59:00.625 --> 59:01.458
Luke?

59:30.958 --> 59:34.541
"Oh, honey,
why do you have a cut on your lip?"

59:35.041 --> 59:39.625
"Hmm. It's 'cause I'm betrothed
to a sexual deviant, Mother."

59:53.958 --> 59:56.416
TifAni, I've told Headmaster Mayer

59:56.500 --> 59:58.875
about the events
with the three boys this weekend.

1:00:00.208 --> 1:00:02.375
Are you talking about
reporting this, TifAni?

1:00:04.375 --> 1:00:07.083
How does that work? What happens?

1:00:08.291 --> 1:00:10.833
The boys
will be questioned by the police.

1:00:12.125 --> 1:00:15.708
It will need to be disclosed on their
college applications, potentially.

1:00:17.875 --> 1:00:20.125
If you decide to go that route,

1:00:20.208 --> 1:00:22.458
you need to be absolutely sure
what you're saying,

1:00:22.541 --> 1:00:26.041
and that can be difficult to determine
with so much alcohol involved.

1:00:26.125 --> 1:00:28.291
The situation has been obfuscated.

1:00:29.250 --> 1:00:32.333
There was no obfuscation,
Headmaster Mayer.

1:00:33.666 --> 1:00:34.750
She said no.

1:00:36.833 --> 1:00:38.916
Is that true? Did you say no?

1:00:43.083 --> 1:00:44.291
I-I don't know.

1:00:45.958 --> 1:00:46.833
I don't know.

1:00:48.791 --> 1:00:49.916
I didn't want to.

1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:53.125
I said, "Ow."

1:00:54.500 --> 1:00:56.250
I just remember always saying, "Ow."

1:00:56.333 --> 1:00:58.958
I remember screaming at Dean. Uh…

1:00:59.041 --> 1:01:00.625
I tried to push Liam off of me,

1:01:00.708 --> 1:01:04.500
but he thought I was, like,
touching his face so he kissed me.

1:01:06.625 --> 1:01:08.041
He was really drunk too.

1:01:15.166 --> 1:01:17.541
-What… What are you doing?
-I'm calling your mom.

1:01:18.500 --> 1:01:21.791
Legally, I can't contact
the police regarding a minor

1:01:21.875 --> 1:01:23.791
unless the guardian is informed.

1:01:27.250 --> 1:01:29.291
Stop.

1:01:30.708 --> 1:01:31.625
Stop.

1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:33.833
No.

1:01:36.041 --> 1:01:36.875
No.

1:01:40.500 --> 1:01:41.625
I changed my mind.

1:01:54.041 --> 1:01:56.666
Mr. Larson got fired. 

1:01:57.541 --> 1:01:59.750
They said he shouldn't
have let us leave the school dance.

1:02:00.333 --> 1:02:03.208
He's the scapegoat.
Dean's fucking untouchable.

1:02:03.750 --> 1:02:04.583
Come in.

1:02:12.291 --> 1:02:14.041
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

1:02:14.125 --> 1:02:15.708
Um, that… that belonged to his dad.

1:02:15.791 --> 1:02:18.833
Yeah. Legacy to Columbia
and a surefire way out of this hellscape

1:02:18.916 --> 1:02:20.375
is the only thing he ever gave me.

1:02:20.458 --> 1:02:22.000
-Want some?
-No.

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:25.416
I can't breathe.

1:02:26.916 --> 1:02:28.833
Should we tell her?

1:02:30.625 --> 1:02:31.500
Tell me what?

1:02:32.291 --> 1:02:33.250
Um…

1:02:33.333 --> 1:02:36.666
-Ar-Arthur, can we… can we just not?
-Come on, we're among friends.

1:02:37.458 --> 1:02:39.375
Two summers ago, Dean and Peyton showed up

1:02:39.458 --> 1:02:41.666
to Kelsey Quick's
eighth grade graduation party.

1:02:41.750 --> 1:02:43.916
They were all 16 and fucked up
and, you know, like--

1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:47.333
-I thought that they were being nice.
-Oh, they were not being nice.

1:02:47.416 --> 1:02:49.041
They said they wanted to smoke up with us.

1:02:49.125 --> 1:02:52.833
You always leave that part out to make me
look like I'm a fucking idiot for going.

1:02:54.333 --> 1:02:55.166
Going where?

1:02:55.250 --> 1:02:58.083
Well, into the woods,
where Peyton pinned Ben to the ground,

1:02:58.166 --> 1:02:59.916
and Dean took a shit on Ben's chest.

1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.541
I heard that he ate
a burrito that day in preparation.

1:03:02.625 --> 1:03:05.625
Fuck you, Arthur!
You're such a fucking prick, man.

1:03:07.250 --> 1:03:09.458
Yeah, okay.
Then he ran straight to Suburban Square,

1:03:09.541 --> 1:03:11.416
went to the Rite Aid,
bought a pack of razors,

1:03:11.500 --> 1:03:13.166
and slit his wrists in the bathroom.

1:03:18.333 --> 1:03:19.541
Is that really true?

1:03:19.625 --> 1:03:20.458
Yeah.

1:03:22.333 --> 1:03:24.791
What? He obviously didn't cut deep enough
to do any real damage.

1:03:24.875 --> 1:03:27.583
His parents sent him off to make
macaroni art for the rest of the summer.

1:03:27.666 --> 1:03:30.916
Why are you like that to him?
You're acting like you're mad at him.

1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.166
-I am fucking mad at him.
-Why?

1:03:33.250 --> 1:03:34.666
He didn't do anything about it.

1:03:34.750 --> 1:03:37.208
I mean, it's gotta be a crime,
biological warfare.

1:03:38.250 --> 1:03:39.791
He just wanted it dropped.

1:03:42.875 --> 1:03:47.250
And now here it is happening again,

1:03:47.833 --> 1:03:48.916
and here you are,

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:52.583
keeping that runway free and clear
for it to keep happening.

1:04:00.666 --> 1:04:01.750
My mom can't know.

1:04:03.541 --> 1:04:04.458
She would hate me.

1:04:04.541 --> 1:04:06.541
Okay. Yeah, that's what everybody thinks.

1:04:07.041 --> 1:04:09.833
My ass got suspended, my mommy
still thinks the sun shines out of it.

1:04:09.916 --> 1:04:12.708
No. You don't understand what she's like.

1:04:14.208 --> 1:04:15.458
Yeah, I really don't.

1:04:16.333 --> 1:04:19.541
What kind of mother doesn't strap
those babies into a cable knit?

1:04:27.708 --> 1:04:29.875
["This Must Be the Place

1:04:34.416 --> 1:04:37.333
Baby, check this out.

1:04:37.416 --> 1:04:39.083
Oh good, another cable knit.

1:04:41.541 --> 1:04:43.958
-You like this for the first dance, right?
-No.

1:04:44.041 --> 1:04:46.875
-What? I thought we agreed?
-No. No, we never agreed.

1:04:46.958 --> 1:04:48.625
-We sure did.
-Oh my God!

1:04:48.708 --> 1:04:51.041
We talked about this. Oh my God!

1:04:52.583 --> 1:04:55.125
-Oh my God. Okay, what's next?
-And then…

1:04:55.208 --> 1:04:56.708
Okay, well, this is the list.

1:04:56.791 --> 1:04:58.833
-Wedding Playlist Party.
-Okay.

1:04:58.916 --> 1:05:00.208
-No, do not play.

1:05:00.291 --> 1:05:01.500
-No?
-Do not play.

1:05:01.583 --> 1:05:03.416
-Definitely do not play.

1:05:04.333 --> 1:05:05.916
-You don't like this song?
-No, I…

1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:08.708
I do like the song,
but the guy's a pedophile.

1:05:09.750 --> 1:05:13.000
-You can still like the song though.
-Right, I do like the song.

1:05:13.083 --> 1:05:14.625
What are you not getting?

1:05:15.208 --> 1:05:17.000
You think what you just said
makes any sense?

1:05:18.375 --> 1:05:20.208
-Turn it off.
-No.

1:05:21.041 --> 1:05:22.250
Turn off the song…

1:05:23.083 --> 1:05:25.000
Luke, turn off the fucking song!

1:05:25.916 --> 1:05:27.333
-Fine.

1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:29.833
Happy?

1:05:44.583 --> 1:05:47.250
Aw. It's my two favorite people.

1:05:49.041 --> 1:05:51.416
You tell the headmaster
how much you loved it?

1:05:51.500 --> 1:05:53.958
That's so cute. That's adorable.

1:05:56.583 --> 1:05:58.458
Damn, you really do have a wide load.

1:06:01.291 --> 1:06:03.208
Oh, thanks, I've been doing squats.

1:06:05.583 --> 1:06:07.041
Stop. Stop, let's go.

1:06:09.458 --> 1:06:11.458
-Oh my God.
-You're cute when you're mad.

1:06:11.541 --> 1:06:14.416
Come on, hit me. No one's gonna stop you.
No one ever stops you.

1:06:17.750 --> 1:06:19.000
Oh, fuck him up!

1:06:21.208 --> 1:06:22.708
It's all your fault!

1:06:24.500 --> 1:06:25.333
Come on!

1:06:32.041 --> 1:06:32.875
Shit.

1:06:32.958 --> 1:06:34.833
Dean, go. Go!
Get the fuck out of here.

1:06:34.916 --> 1:06:35.875
Go.

1:06:36.458 --> 1:06:37.458
Oh, fuck.

1:06:37.541 --> 1:06:40.000
-Go. Get out.
-What is going on?

1:06:46.833 --> 1:06:47.666
Ow!

1:06:50.458 --> 1:06:53.166
You didn't know it was Mrs. Hurst.
Why can't you just apologize?

1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:57.375
Oh, like you did? And everything
is just peachy keen for you now?

1:06:57.458 --> 1:06:59.583
Oh, come on,
it's better than getting expelled.

1:07:00.083 --> 1:07:02.041
Think you're gonna get into Columbia now?

1:07:02.125 --> 1:07:04.750
Okay, kindly adjust your tone, young lady.

1:07:04.833 --> 1:07:07.083
I was standing up for my friend.

1:07:11.916 --> 1:07:12.750
I know.

1:07:18.875 --> 1:07:19.708
Thank you.

1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000
I don't want you to thank me,

1:07:24.083 --> 1:07:27.333
I want you to act
like you have a smidge of dignity.

1:07:27.416 --> 1:07:29.750
Just a tiny microscopic smidge.

1:07:29.833 --> 1:07:32.500
I mean, you have to have
that much at least, right?

1:07:40.041 --> 1:07:42.291
You can't be mad at me.
I didn't ask you to do any of this.

1:07:42.375 --> 1:07:44.000
You should be mad at you.

1:07:44.083 --> 1:07:46.541
You had a chance to take him down,
and you didn't

1:07:46.625 --> 1:07:49.291
'cause you're so fucking desperate
to redeem yourself.

1:07:50.291 --> 1:07:53.625
-You sound so fucking stupid right now.
-Yeah, I'm the stupid one.

1:07:53.708 --> 1:07:57.291
I'm not gonna take Dean down.
It doesn't fucking work like that, Arthur.

1:07:58.125 --> 1:08:00.666
You apologized to Liam, for fuck's sake.

1:08:00.750 --> 1:08:03.125
You apologized to your own fucking rapist.

1:08:03.208 --> 1:08:06.083
I mean, seriously,
how can you live with yourself?

1:08:09.333 --> 1:08:10.416
Fuck you.

1:08:11.041 --> 1:08:12.125
TifAni, wait, no.

1:08:13.416 --> 1:08:15.666
TifAni, wait. TifAni.

1:08:18.708 --> 1:08:20.708
Here.
You're such a fucking loser.

1:08:26.500 --> 1:08:29.083
Hey, babe,
I just wanna say good luck today.

1:08:29.166 --> 1:08:31.583
I know you're nervous,
but it's gonna be okay.

1:08:32.541 --> 1:08:34.458
You deserve closure on this.

1:08:34.541 --> 1:08:35.750
Love you. Bye.

1:09:08.666 --> 1:09:09.958
Ani, you ready?

1:09:22.041 --> 1:09:23.708
Just up here.

1:09:24.416 --> 1:09:27.375
Uh, if you need anything,
you can feel free to tell me.

1:09:30.250 --> 1:09:31.083
Uh…

1:09:38.541 --> 1:09:39.625
-Set?
-Set.

1:09:42.416 --> 1:09:43.416
Rolling.

1:09:47.875 --> 1:09:50.791
Okay, uh, Ani, you ready?

1:09:52.500 --> 1:09:55.291
Can you tell us your personal experience
of that tragic day?

1:09:56.083 --> 1:09:57.208
Whenever you're ready.

1:10:00.208 --> 1:10:01.666
You know, I… I always thought

1:10:01.750 --> 1:10:04.375
the most vulnerable
you'll ever see a person is from behind.

1:10:07.750 --> 1:10:11.750
Like, you can autopsy every pore,
every hair,

1:10:12.500 --> 1:10:14.041
like they're defenseless.

1:10:14.791 --> 1:10:16.166
I always thought it was cute

1:10:16.250 --> 1:10:19.500
that the back of Dean's neck
had blonde hairs

1:10:19.583 --> 1:10:23.583
when everywhere else
was dark and coarse, when he jumped.

1:10:59.708 --> 1:11:03.166
Tif! Tif! Tif!

1:11:03.250 --> 1:11:05.333
Come on! Come on! Come on!

1:11:18.333 --> 1:11:20.291
-Come on!

1:11:20.791 --> 1:11:21.833
Go, go, go!

1:11:47.125 --> 1:11:48.666
He had a gun. I saw him.

1:11:49.208 --> 1:11:51.416
-Okay, okay, okay.
-Who has a phone?

1:11:52.625 --> 1:11:53.875
Phone? Okay, okay, okay.

1:11:58.500 --> 1:12:00.125
-Ben!

1:12:01.208 --> 1:12:03.041
No bars! 

1:12:06.583 --> 1:12:08.166
You're sad about that.

1:12:08.833 --> 1:12:09.666
Look sad.

1:12:10.166 --> 1:12:11.583
She didn't deserve that.

1:12:22.791 --> 1:12:25.291
Witnesses claim that Ben said…

1:12:25.875 --> 1:12:27.625
-Hey, Tif.

1:12:31.958 --> 1:12:34.208
As though the two of you
had an understanding.

1:12:34.291 --> 1:12:35.250
Is that true?

1:12:36.416 --> 1:12:37.250
Yes.

1:12:40.125 --> 1:12:41.958
What was that understanding?

1:12:42.708 --> 1:12:44.458
I wanted revenge too.

1:12:45.625 --> 1:12:47.500
That he was a victim too.

1:12:56.041 --> 1:12:56.916
Hey, Peyton.

1:13:01.625 --> 1:13:04.541
-Do you wanna go to the woods, man? Hmm?

1:13:05.541 --> 1:13:07.541
-Smoke some pot, man?
-Ben.

1:13:07.625 --> 1:13:09.208
Ben, I am so, so sorry--

1:13:16.375 --> 1:13:17.291
Ben?

1:13:18.166 --> 1:13:19.000
Ben!

1:13:25.958 --> 1:13:28.000
What were you feeling when he walked away?

1:13:28.500 --> 1:13:30.916
Was it just this total collective relief?

1:13:32.791 --> 1:13:37.041
You know… we all came together
at that moment,

1:13:37.125 --> 1:13:39.833
'cause we… we knew
that we had to help Peyton.

1:13:44.625 --> 1:13:45.833
Oh my God.

1:13:45.916 --> 1:13:48.083
-Hey.
-No. No, no.

1:13:48.166 --> 1:13:49.625
How is this happening?

1:13:50.291 --> 1:13:51.625
How is this happening?

1:13:52.833 --> 1:13:54.208
We need to get out of here.

1:14:00.250 --> 1:14:01.750
What the fuck's that gonna do?

1:14:05.416 --> 1:14:07.375
We need to get out of here.

1:14:11.041 --> 1:14:13.416
-Up or down?
-The old dorm rooms are up.

1:14:13.500 --> 1:14:14.625
Would he have gone up?

1:14:21.541 --> 1:14:22.375
I vote down.

1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:36.250
-Go, go! Come on! Run! Run!
-Go, go, go!

1:14:36.333 --> 1:14:37.750
Come on! 

1:14:39.291 --> 1:14:40.666
Hurry, come on!

1:15:02.750 --> 1:15:04.916
You didn't hold the door open
for Liam Ross.

1:15:06.625 --> 1:15:08.875
I wanna give you the chance
to explain why.

1:15:08.958 --> 1:15:12.833
Because I wasn't going to put
my life on the line for one of my rapists.

1:15:12.916 --> 1:15:14.708
I guess I wasn't brave enough.

1:15:27.458 --> 1:15:30.416
Oh my God. Oh my God!
Dean! Dean! Dean!

1:15:35.083 --> 1:15:35.916
Dean.

1:15:40.916 --> 1:15:41.750
Ladies.

1:15:42.625 --> 1:15:44.041
-There you are.

1:15:46.375 --> 1:15:47.541
Arthur.

1:15:47.625 --> 1:15:51.041
Beth. Get out of here. I like you.

1:15:55.458 --> 1:15:56.583
-You…

1:15:56.666 --> 1:15:58.375
Girl with spaghetti for a spine.

1:16:06.458 --> 1:16:07.875
You know you want to.

1:16:10.666 --> 1:16:12.500
Is it so bad that I did?

1:16:28.083 --> 1:16:29.083
Please.

1:16:33.208 --> 1:16:34.916
Fuck!

1:17:17.416 --> 1:17:20.958
You know, the look on his face,
like… he was so confused,

1:17:21.041 --> 1:17:23.375
like I was doing it to the wrong person.

1:17:27.375 --> 1:17:29.416
You know, to this day,
I can't hold a knife in my hand

1:17:29.500 --> 1:17:30.708
without seeing his face.

1:17:38.791 --> 1:17:40.125
My goodness, Ani.

1:17:40.666 --> 1:17:41.500
Thank you.

1:18:01.083 --> 1:18:02.500
It's going to be fine.

1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:05.208
You did a brave thing, TifAni.

1:18:07.333 --> 1:18:08.666
Please don't say that.

1:18:39.833 --> 1:18:42.916
I can't believe she showed up.
So disgusting.

1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:44.583
Can you believe that?

1:18:44.666 --> 1:18:48.500
I didn't realize I walked into
the funeral with a target on my back.

1:18:51.875 --> 1:18:54.833
Dean's version of events
didn't exactly match mine.

1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:58.083
And Dean's version of events was?

1:19:00.125 --> 1:19:02.541
That he didn't wanna be my boyfriend

1:19:02.625 --> 1:19:05.041
after I slept with him
and his two best friends.

1:19:05.541 --> 1:19:06.708
That I was jilted.

1:19:07.208 --> 1:19:10.833
Due to TifAni having relationships
with more than one of these boys…

1:19:10.916 --> 1:19:14.666
That I got my revenge by helping
Ben and Arthur plan a massacre.

1:19:14.750 --> 1:19:17.708
Hell have no fury
like a woman scorned and whatnot.

1:19:20.125 --> 1:19:21.875
Let me escort you back to your car.

1:19:28.916 --> 1:19:29.791
Beth?

1:19:34.458 --> 1:19:38.041
And for the grand finale,
we were all gonna shoot ourselves.

1:19:38.125 --> 1:19:40.333
Although only Ben managed to do that.

1:19:45.250 --> 1:19:47.375
You know, Dean was never gonna walk again,

1:19:48.583 --> 1:19:50.583
so who would dare call him a liar?

1:19:55.125 --> 1:19:56.125
Is it true?

1:19:57.583 --> 1:19:59.833
I had no idea Arthur
was gonna do something like that--

1:19:59.916 --> 1:20:01.875
Not that part, the part about the boys!

1:20:04.875 --> 1:20:06.208
I didn't want to, Mom.

1:20:06.291 --> 1:20:09.041
-I was drunk. They're lying.
-Oh my God, TifAni.

1:20:09.125 --> 1:20:11.333
This is why I say no drinking!

1:20:12.041 --> 1:20:15.083
Well, I'm gonna call a lawyer
as soon as I get home.

1:20:16.666 --> 1:20:19.083
Oh, what are people gonna say?

1:20:23.458 --> 1:20:25.541
You're never charged
as an accomplice. But…

1:20:25.625 --> 1:20:27.416
What about your claims against the boys?

1:20:27.500 --> 1:20:29.416
Why didn't you file charges back then?

1:20:31.166 --> 1:20:33.416
I just thought
they weren't worth pursuing.

1:20:33.500 --> 1:20:34.333
Mom.

1:20:36.750 --> 1:20:38.375
-Mom--
-No, TifAni.

1:20:39.750 --> 1:20:40.958
No, no.

1:20:41.541 --> 1:20:43.041
-You disgust me.

1:20:44.833 --> 1:20:45.875
I'm sorry.

1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:50.958
You are not the daughter that I raised.

1:20:58.666 --> 1:21:01.583
You're lucky you have a mother
who got you a lawyer and supported you.

1:21:02.083 --> 1:21:03.208
Not everyone has that.

1:21:03.708 --> 1:21:05.541
Hmm. Yes.

1:21:06.250 --> 1:21:07.166
Very lucky.

1:21:08.750 --> 1:21:10.916
Luckiest girl alive right here.

1:21:11.750 --> 1:21:14.000
Do you wish your mother
did more to help you?

1:21:15.125 --> 1:21:19.125
I wish she hadn't looked at me
like I was rode hard and put away wet.

1:21:22.958 --> 1:21:25.416
Ani, do you wanna say more about that,
or should I move on?

1:21:29.958 --> 1:21:31.625
-Aaron, what the fuck?
-Hi, Finny.

1:21:31.708 --> 1:21:33.375
I swear, he's not supposed to be here
until tomorrow.

1:21:33.458 --> 1:21:34.666
-You need to get outta here.
-Wait.

1:21:34.750 --> 1:21:36.916
Finny, please. Just give me five minutes.

1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:39.208
What are you doing here?
This is not what we talked about.

1:21:39.291 --> 1:21:42.666
Ani, stay. Ani, don't go. He should be
the one to go. I'm getting him outta here.

1:21:42.750 --> 1:21:44.458
-Finny.
-No, no. Don't worry about it.

1:21:44.541 --> 1:21:46.291
-Ani.
-Please.

1:21:46.958 --> 1:21:47.958
Ani, wait.

1:21:51.041 --> 1:21:54.666
Ani, wait. Ani.
Don't let Dean run you out of here.

1:21:54.750 --> 1:21:57.458
Think about all the women
you're gonna help by telling your story.

1:22:00.333 --> 1:22:01.791
You're standing up for them too.

1:22:03.166 --> 1:22:04.541
All the women will be fine.

1:22:31.625 --> 1:22:34.208
My mother insisted
I stick it out at Brentley.

1:22:34.708 --> 1:22:36.333
It was a lonely two years.

1:22:36.916 --> 1:22:39.750
My classmates and I
had survived this life-changing event

1:22:39.833 --> 1:22:41.500
that few people could understand.

1:22:44.875 --> 1:22:46.291
They could lean on each other.

1:22:48.916 --> 1:22:50.041
But I had no one.

1:22:52.791 --> 1:22:55.708
My senior year,
we took a field trip to New York City,

1:22:55.791 --> 1:22:58.958
where I had this… experience.

1:23:00.125 --> 1:23:02.166
I don't need to impress him.

1:23:02.250 --> 1:23:04.666
So do you know when the samples
are actually arriving?

1:23:06.083 --> 1:23:07.291
-You okay?
-Sorry.

1:23:07.875 --> 1:23:10.083
No, the samples
have to be there by Friday.

1:23:10.916 --> 1:23:13.708
Yes, Friday. Did you not schedule it?

1:23:15.166 --> 1:23:18.125
I'd never seen a woman like that before.

1:23:18.208 --> 1:23:20.916
A woman who threatened people
on the phone,

1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:23.458
who could buy herself expensive things,

1:23:24.208 --> 1:23:27.041
who cut a path through New York City
simply because she looked like

1:23:27.125 --> 1:23:30.250
she had more important places to be
than anyone else.

1:23:30.333 --> 1:23:32.708
I just had to get to that, I decided…

1:23:38.958 --> 1:23:41.625
And no one could ever hurt me again.

1:23:55.333 --> 1:23:56.791
Oh, come on.

1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:03.333
-Who wants another one?
-Yeah, grab me one.

1:24:03.416 --> 1:24:05.208
One, two, three, four more?

1:24:05.291 --> 1:24:07.625
-Yes, sir. Thank you.
-Here we go, boys.

1:24:11.208 --> 1:24:13.583
There it is. I told you.

1:24:14.166 --> 1:24:16.291
-You're home.
-Yeah!

1:24:16.375 --> 1:24:17.708
-Yeah.

1:24:17.791 --> 1:24:18.750
I left.

1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:20.958
I'm done.

1:24:22.625 --> 1:24:23.625
It just, um…

1:24:25.416 --> 1:24:26.750
It just didn't feel right.

1:24:28.375 --> 1:24:31.208
You know, I'm thinking about
actually writing something myself.

1:24:32.166 --> 1:24:33.583
Get it out of my system that way.

1:24:38.791 --> 1:24:40.208
I think that's really smart.

1:24:48.958 --> 1:24:50.583
-Uh…

1:24:53.041 --> 1:24:54.083
You want a drink?

1:24:56.416 --> 1:24:59.208
Martini, straight up,
three olives, no vermouth.

1:25:01.333 --> 1:25:03.541
-Vodka, olives coming right up.
-Okay.

1:25:08.458 --> 1:25:10.250
Exactly. I didn't say that.

1:25:16.416 --> 1:25:17.833
Thank you for your service.

1:25:21.125 --> 1:25:23.791
Please don't be mad,
but I think I'm moving to London.

1:25:26.666 --> 1:25:28.500
You think?

1:25:29.750 --> 1:25:32.625
Well, guess what?
I am mad, so deal with it.

1:25:39.166 --> 1:25:40.041
What's that?

1:25:40.916 --> 1:25:42.291
I've written something.

1:25:44.333 --> 1:25:46.041
You think The Times would want it?

1:26:23.041 --> 1:26:25.500
You know what I wish I knew 38 years ago?

1:26:27.750 --> 1:26:30.791
It's a lot easier
to be angry with the guy.

1:26:34.541 --> 1:26:36.041
My high school boyfriend…

1:26:41.166 --> 1:26:43.583
could be creative.

1:26:45.291 --> 1:26:46.333
I'm sorry, LoLo.

1:26:46.416 --> 1:26:49.500
It's all right.
There's no need to make a scene.

1:26:50.583 --> 1:26:53.583
Your guys, I mean,
they rot in the ground or whatever,

1:26:53.666 --> 1:26:55.375
but the people who love you,

1:26:55.458 --> 1:26:57.125
who failed you so miserably,

1:26:57.208 --> 1:26:59.958
stop trying to protect them
with this vague half-assery,

1:27:00.041 --> 1:27:01.833
and you might actually
have something there.

1:27:01.916 --> 1:27:03.833
But for now, let me be perfectly clear,

1:27:04.458 --> 1:27:06.125
an approximation of honesty

1:27:06.208 --> 1:27:08.375
doesn't make the cut
at the paper of record.

1:27:08.458 --> 1:27:11.000
So, you know, take another swing at it.

1:27:11.083 --> 1:27:13.041
Write it like no one will ever read it.

1:27:13.125 --> 1:27:16.625
Not Luke, not your musty in-laws,
definitely not your parents.

1:27:16.708 --> 1:27:19.583
That is how you write
something worth reading.

1:27:21.541 --> 1:27:23.958
I mean, no one's
making you write about it.

1:27:24.041 --> 1:27:26.250
I mean, go to London.
Go live your life with Luke.

1:27:26.333 --> 1:27:28.833
Just decide something.

1:27:29.375 --> 1:27:30.250
Decide.

1:27:30.333 --> 1:27:32.000
I'm… I'm trying.

1:27:34.916 --> 1:27:36.875
Look, I'll make it very simple for you.

1:27:38.083 --> 1:27:41.166
You just say what it is that you want,

1:27:41.250 --> 1:27:43.625
not what everyone else wants,

1:27:43.708 --> 1:27:45.333
and then you do that.

1:27:49.333 --> 1:27:52.041
-If you tell anyone what I just told you--
-I won't.

1:27:52.125 --> 1:27:54.875
No, about it being 38 years
since I was a teenager,

1:27:54.958 --> 1:27:58.000
I will hunt you down
and make you eat a carb.

1:28:10.875 --> 1:28:13.750
I had a choice to make on that day.

1:28:14.958 --> 1:28:17.333
I could blame the world
for what happened to me,

1:28:18.375 --> 1:28:19.916
or I could find the opportunity.

1:28:21.541 --> 1:28:24.625
Every challenge, every heartache,

1:28:24.708 --> 1:28:26.250
every tragedy in life

1:28:26.333 --> 1:28:30.083
offers an opportunity
to do something different,

1:28:30.166 --> 1:28:31.166
to do something kind.

1:28:31.250 --> 1:28:33.875
I told you.
So inspiring, right?

1:28:33.958 --> 1:28:36.083
I haven't heard a word he's said.

1:28:36.750 --> 1:28:39.916
-…no one can ever take away that choice.
-Shh.

1:29:05.416 --> 1:29:09.583
Look, I could admit that I lied
about your involvement in the shooting.

1:29:11.083 --> 1:29:14.458
I was young a-and scared, confused.

1:29:15.416 --> 1:29:17.333
People will understand that.

1:29:19.416 --> 1:29:23.791
But… I don't know how the hell
I'm gonna explain what happened with us.

1:29:25.333 --> 1:29:26.166
I have a wife.

1:29:26.875 --> 1:29:28.375
Three, two--

1:29:28.458 --> 1:29:29.416
Daughters.

1:29:29.500 --> 1:29:31.333
Mmm. Right at the buzzer.

1:29:31.416 --> 1:29:35.250
And this would destroy them.

1:29:36.291 --> 1:29:38.916
But me, I was fair game?

1:29:39.750 --> 1:29:41.875
I was just trying to get out ahead of you.

1:29:42.500 --> 1:29:45.833
I was scared that you'd tell the cops
about that night at my house.

1:29:46.500 --> 1:29:49.125
Plus, I was stuck in this,
and you weren't.

1:29:49.958 --> 1:29:51.958
So I was so angry at you.

1:29:54.166 --> 1:29:58.791
Do you know the difference between me
and someone like you, Dean?

1:30:01.333 --> 1:30:03.541
Between me and an Arthur?

1:30:03.625 --> 1:30:07.125
Because I was angry too,
so fucking angry you wouldn't believe it.

1:30:07.208 --> 1:30:10.250
But my anger is like carbon monoxide.

1:30:11.291 --> 1:30:16.041
It's odorless, tasteless,
colorless, and completely toxic

1:30:17.416 --> 1:30:19.541
but only to me.

1:30:20.583 --> 1:30:24.083
See, I don't take my anger out
on anyone other than my fucking self.

1:30:24.166 --> 1:30:25.041
Shh.

1:30:28.375 --> 1:30:30.958
I didn't mean for it to happen like that.

1:30:31.750 --> 1:30:35.375
I was… drunk, you know?

1:30:35.458 --> 1:30:38.916
I didn't even understand that
that is what I was doing.

1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:40.500
Not when I was crying?

1:30:41.166 --> 1:30:44.666
Not when I was begging you to wait. Wait.

1:30:45.250 --> 1:30:49.250
Wait, like we were gonna… we were gonna
talk about it, figure it out.

1:30:50.416 --> 1:30:52.541
Do you know that every time
I start to feel

1:30:52.625 --> 1:30:55.708
just a little bit good about myself,
I remember that I begged…

1:30:57.541 --> 1:30:58.833
and there that goes.

1:31:02.208 --> 1:31:05.458
If you talk about that night,
I'll deny it…

1:31:07.125 --> 1:31:10.875
and I'll double down on my claim
that you planned it with Arthur and Ben.

1:31:12.875 --> 1:31:15.541
And there's a lot of people
that are gonna believe me.

1:31:17.041 --> 1:31:19.500
Are you seriously
trying to threaten me right now?

1:31:21.166 --> 1:31:23.375
I'm trying to offer you a deal.

1:31:24.500 --> 1:31:25.333
Okay?

1:31:25.416 --> 1:31:28.083
You don't talk about
what happened that night.

1:31:29.125 --> 1:31:31.333
And I'll say you had nothing
to do with the shooting.

1:31:32.208 --> 1:31:33.250
There it is.

1:31:34.500 --> 1:31:36.833
Look, I know I was an asshole back then,

1:31:37.416 --> 1:31:41.375
but I have made it my mission
to make up for that every day.

1:31:44.250 --> 1:31:47.083
Does that…
Does that not count for anything?

1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:02.875
Thank you.

1:32:06.708 --> 1:32:08.291
See, I was a victim too…

1:32:10.208 --> 1:32:12.333
but no one ever treated me like one.

1:32:15.166 --> 1:32:18.125
So let's just stop
with your self-pitying bullshit.

1:32:21.083 --> 1:32:24.583
Do you know how many times
I've said the word "rape" in my life?

1:32:25.750 --> 1:32:29.208
I know, I fucking hate that word too.
Makes me wanna peel my skin off.

1:32:30.166 --> 1:32:31.833
I wonder if you've ever used it,

1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:33.958
even once.

1:32:35.291 --> 1:32:36.166
Probably not.

1:32:36.250 --> 1:32:37.625
Probably not.

1:32:40.250 --> 1:32:42.416
So I'm gonna sit here and watch you squirm

1:32:42.500 --> 1:32:44.666
while you make it
a part of your vocabulary.

1:32:49.333 --> 1:32:50.166
Fine.

1:32:50.791 --> 1:32:51.916
Fine.

1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:52.833
You win.

1:32:55.416 --> 1:32:56.500
I, uh…

1:32:57.666 --> 1:32:58.541
I raped you.

1:33:00.250 --> 1:33:01.250
Okay?

1:33:22.625 --> 1:33:24.583
It's really just an honor
to meet you.

1:33:25.083 --> 1:33:28.541
Um, thank you so much.
You're such an inspiration.

1:33:41.791 --> 1:33:43.875
So I'm gonna sit here
and watch you squirm

1:33:43.958 --> 1:33:46.208
while you make it
a part of your vocabulary.

1:33:47.500 --> 1:33:49.500
Fine. You win.

1:33:49.583 --> 1:33:50.833
I, uh…

1:33:50.916 --> 1:33:51.833
I raped you.

1:34:14.750 --> 1:34:15.666
Need a lift?

1:34:51.041 --> 1:34:53.375
Good riddance, TifAni FaNelli,

1:34:54.666 --> 1:34:56.583
welcome, Ani Harrison.

1:35:07.333 --> 1:35:08.500

Yeah.

1:37:18.375 --> 1:37:19.875
How could you not tell me about this?

1:37:23.958 --> 1:37:24.791
I'm sorry.

1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.250
I guess I… I just don't understand. I…

1:37:29.041 --> 1:37:32.208
I always thought
you had moved on from all this.

1:37:33.416 --> 1:37:36.708
I admired you for that.
I thought you were so tough.

1:37:38.958 --> 1:37:44.041
So tough that I try to skip the part
where I hurt about this?

1:37:44.833 --> 1:37:47.250
No. Until I do that, I'm just a fraud.

1:37:47.333 --> 1:37:49.625
Fine, but can't you
work that out privately?

1:37:49.708 --> 1:37:52.833
Do you have to get into the nitty-gritty
details for the whole world?

1:37:54.916 --> 1:38:00.791
Those guys… were going around
making fun of the shape of my pubic hair.

1:38:01.625 --> 1:38:04.083
They were making fun
of the sounds I was making.

1:38:04.166 --> 1:38:07.541
-So yes, the nitty-gritty matters to me.
-They're dead.

1:38:08.500 --> 1:38:12.125
And one of them is in a wheelchair.
Haven't they paid for their mistakes?

1:38:12.208 --> 1:38:14.500
-Their mistakes?
-They fucked up. I'm agreeing with you.

1:38:14.583 --> 1:38:18.875
No, no, no. A-- A fuck-up is when you take
your parent's car without permission

1:38:18.958 --> 1:38:20.375
and… and scratch the paint.

1:38:20.458 --> 1:38:23.333
A fuck-up doesn't even begin
to encompass what they did to me.

1:38:23.416 --> 1:38:25.583
Ani, it's our fucking rehearsal dinner.

1:38:25.666 --> 1:38:27.666
How are we talking about this right now?

1:38:29.541 --> 1:38:33.166
God! You used to be so different.
You used to be so fun.

1:38:35.916 --> 1:38:38.250
-Fun?
-Yes, fun.

1:38:38.791 --> 1:38:41.333
We used to have fun together. I miss that.

1:38:45.708 --> 1:38:47.875
I don't know if I'm fun.

1:38:49.333 --> 1:38:50.875
I don't know what's me

1:38:52.541 --> 1:38:55.500
and what part I invented
to make people like me.

1:38:57.291 --> 1:39:00.458
God, I used to be so proud of that. I-I…

1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:04.458
I thought it was this chameleon
who was so much smarter than everyone.

1:39:05.416 --> 1:39:08.125
So much smarter that
I don't even know a thing about myself.

1:39:08.208 --> 1:39:09.958
Hey, hey. I don't believe that.

1:39:10.041 --> 1:39:12.291
-We can get back there. Hey, stop.

1:39:13.625 --> 1:39:14.958
We can get back there.

1:39:16.083 --> 1:39:19.083
I love you. You love me.
We can figure it out.

1:39:24.041 --> 1:39:24.958
No.

1:39:27.666 --> 1:39:30.833
Do you remember the time
you said you felt like a box

1:39:31.333 --> 1:39:32.750
that I just checked off?

1:39:37.375 --> 1:39:38.500
I do love you…

1:39:44.583 --> 1:39:46.750
But I've been using you.

1:39:49.083 --> 1:39:50.791
I resent you.

1:39:51.291 --> 1:39:53.375
It's not… It's not fair.

1:39:53.458 --> 1:39:57.750
You're not the one who hurt me,
but I… but I take it out on you.

1:39:57.833 --> 1:40:00.791
-I've never felt like you resent me.
-Because I'm like a wind-up doll.

1:40:00.875 --> 1:40:04.333
Turn my key, and I'll tell you
exactly what you wanna hear.

1:40:06.625 --> 1:40:11.083
I have denied myself
and denied myself.

1:40:12.708 --> 1:40:13.750
I'm fine.

1:40:14.708 --> 1:40:15.875
I'm not hurt.

1:40:16.458 --> 1:40:19.833
And it has… it has built up
this rage inside of me.

1:40:22.583 --> 1:40:24.916
Look, I… I should've faced up
to all of this sooner.

1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:27.208
I… I just think that I need to do it now

1:40:27.291 --> 1:40:31.750
without worrying about what you
or anyone else thinks about it.

1:40:33.916 --> 1:40:35.791
Is this really happening right now?

1:41:27.458 --> 1:41:28.916
It's like LoLo said,

1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:31.833
an approximation of honesty
won't make the cut.

1:41:32.583 --> 1:41:34.250
And that's what I had with Luke.

1:41:35.666 --> 1:41:37.041
I hate that I hurt him,

1:41:38.375 --> 1:41:40.083
but this is where I belong.

1:41:41.166 --> 1:41:43.750
This is what I always wanted.

1:41:50.125 --> 1:41:52.208
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't suffering

1:41:52.291 --> 1:41:54.875
from a mild case of phantom limb syndrome.

1:41:56.375 --> 1:41:59.208
But maybe things are brighter without it.

1:42:04.625 --> 1:42:06.291
"If you read one thing today,

1:42:06.375 --> 1:42:10.375
it should be Ani FaNelli's essay
in New York Times Magazine."

1:42:10.458 --> 1:42:14.166
"I sent it to every woman I know,
and so should you!"

1:42:14.250 --> 1:42:16.666
-Oh, Dean Barton is so fucked!

1:42:16.750 --> 1:42:17.666
Oh my God!

1:42:17.750 --> 1:42:19.625
-Ooh! Get up!
-I'm up!

1:42:19.708 --> 1:42:20.958
You're going viral!

1:42:21.041 --> 1:42:24.541
-Oh my God.
-Ugh! Wait, do you… do you have any OJ?

1:42:24.625 --> 1:42:27.208
Yeah, I keep the Sunny D
in the side door.

1:42:27.291 --> 1:42:28.458
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

1:42:28.541 --> 1:42:30.166
She's a funny writer girl.

1:42:50.416 --> 1:42:51.541
Look it!

1:42:51.625 --> 1:42:53.291
-Look at this!

1:42:54.958 --> 1:42:57.375
Ah! I'm so proud of you.

1:42:59.833 --> 1:43:03.750
I just finished reading
your piece and am utterly haunted.

1:43:04.666 --> 1:43:06.250
Thank you for speaking up.

1:43:06.916 --> 1:43:10.541
From someone who has always felt like
no one would listen to her anyway.

1:43:16.250 --> 1:43:18.416
I cried reading your essay.

1:43:20.125 --> 1:43:23.000
Thank you for putting it out
into the world.

1:43:26.458 --> 1:43:29.916
I was also assaulted
by a guy I thought was a friend.

1:43:30.500 --> 1:43:34.333
Hearing your story gives me hope
that one day I can tell mine too.

1:43:36.041 --> 1:43:38.958
I was raped while completely unconscious.

1:43:39.958 --> 1:43:41.875
The lines about coming to

1:43:43.083 --> 1:43:45.083
hit me so hard.

1:43:50.750 --> 1:43:52.458
I never told anyone,

1:43:53.541 --> 1:43:54.875
not even my husband.

1:44:25.291 --> 1:44:30.250
When I sat down to write this essay,
the goal was to avenge my reputation,

1:44:30.916 --> 1:44:33.333
maybe stick it to the people who hurt me.

1:44:34.791 --> 1:44:37.125
But it's become so much more than that.

1:44:37.208 --> 1:44:40.291
-Ani. So nice to meet you.
-So much more than me.

1:44:40.375 --> 1:44:41.750
Of course. Thank you.

1:44:42.250 --> 1:44:43.958
Now, I read your op-ed…

1:44:44.041 --> 1:44:46.750
It's about the importance
of all of us speaking freely,

1:44:47.291 --> 1:44:49.458
even if people wanna silence us.

1:44:50.041 --> 1:44:53.625
So that we can become the kind of women
our younger selves would admire.

1:44:54.125 --> 1:44:57.291
I'm hearing from women
who have never shared their stories,

1:44:57.375 --> 1:44:59.708
from women who have carried
this horrible thing

1:44:59.791 --> 1:45:01.958
with them alone for 38 years,

1:45:02.041 --> 1:45:06.500
and I just hope that no one
has to ever do that again.

1:45:07.875 --> 1:45:10.458
I hope that people
feel compelled to share their stories,

1:45:10.541 --> 1:45:12.916
to talk about what happened to them,

1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:17.083
and to know
that you have nothing to be ashamed of.

1:45:23.666 --> 1:45:24.541
Wow.

1:45:25.250 --> 1:45:27.000
Ani, thank you so much for being here.

1:45:27.083 --> 1:45:28.833
-Of course.
-Truly inspiring story.

1:45:28.916 --> 1:45:29.833
Thank you.

1:45:52.833 --> 1:45:54.375
TifAni FaNelli, right?

1:45:55.041 --> 1:45:55.875
Yeah.

1:45:55.958 --> 1:45:58.541
Sarah Gardener.
I cover public health for Bloomberg.

1:45:59.041 --> 1:45:59.875
Okay.

1:45:59.958 --> 1:46:02.125
Gun control is under my domain.

1:46:02.208 --> 1:46:04.791
I've covered Dean Barton's career
quite extensively.

1:46:05.375 --> 1:46:07.500
He's helped a lot of people
over the years.

1:46:09.041 --> 1:46:11.541
Let's hope
your 15 minutes of fame will too.

1:46:12.916 --> 1:46:13.791
Nice to meet you.

1:46:14.958 --> 1:46:16.041
Nice to meet you.

1:46:19.333 --> 1:46:21.416
Excuse me. I'm so sorry. I…

1:46:21.500 --> 1:46:24.291
I would love to stay in touch,
but I already forgot your name.

1:46:24.375 --> 1:46:25.583
-It's Sarah Gard--
-That's okay.

1:46:25.666 --> 1:46:29.500
I'll just remember you as the woman
I told to go fuck herself on 5th Avenue.

1:46:31.500 --> 1:46:33.958
Gotta work
on that delivery, FaNelli,
