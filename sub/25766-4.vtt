00:24.733 --> 00:26.520
Weesh-hoo.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.912
Paydirt.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.582
21... Uh, Number 2!

00:46.713 --> 00:48.579
Step aside!

00:48.715 --> 00:50.707
I'll do the honors.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.219
Oh, clever Venture.

00:55.347 --> 00:57.259
So practiced
in the art of deceit.

00:57.391 --> 01:01.556
But don't you know you can't
hide from your own shadow?!

01:01.687 --> 01:03.178
<i>¡Madre díos!</i>

01:03.313 --> 01:05.474
God can't hear you, <i>Dieciséis!</i>

01:05.607 --> 01:06.607
Minions!

01:06.692 --> 01:11.278
I hold in my hot little hand
the key to our bold new future!

01:11.405 --> 01:15.695
At long last, the full power
of the Mighty Monarch

01:15.826 --> 01:17.783
shall be unleashed!

01:22.040 --> 01:23.827
Mm, ahh!

01:23.959 --> 01:25.291
Oh, that's the stuff.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.001
- Um... Mr. Monarch?
- Mm...

01:27.129 --> 01:28.916
Honey?

01:29.047 --> 01:30.233
Wha... What?

01:30.257 --> 01:31.793
The Councilman
asked you a question.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.417
I said, "What's up
with your eyebrows?"

01:34.553 --> 01:37.261
- Oh, I... ran out of product.
- Mm-hmm.

01:37.389 --> 01:38.829
What, is that gonna
count against me?

01:38.890 --> 01:40.847
Personal grooming
is a factor, yes.

01:40.976 --> 01:44.765
But determining your EMA level
is a calculus of many criterion.

01:44.896 --> 01:47.730
I must say, so far,
your lair does not impress.

01:47.858 --> 01:50.218
Well, we're still in the process
of upgrading our equipment.

01:50.319 --> 01:52.319
We weren't really expecting you
to come by so soon.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.979
Precisely the point
of a "surprise inspection"!

01:55.115 --> 01:57.277
You let your henchmen
speak out of turn?

01:57.409 --> 02:00.243
No, no. He's not a henchman.
He's... He's my Number 2.

02:00.370 --> 02:03.909
The, uh... henchman army you're
looking for is right over here.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.577
Hmph. "Army."

02:05.709 --> 02:07.792
Taylor Swift rolls
with a bigger squad.

02:07.919 --> 02:10.411
And these uniforms!
Cheap jersey knit.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.288
Oh, who are you... Michael Kors?

02:12.424 --> 02:14.086
Honey, help me out here.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.503
Sweetie, my hands are tied.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.674
I can't intercede in the
Councilman's impartial audit.

02:18.805 --> 02:19.805
Then why are you here?!

02:19.931 --> 02:21.547
Sorry.

02:21.683 --> 02:22.969
Look, give it to me straight.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.218
Do I qualify to arch Venture yet
or not?

02:25.354 --> 02:26.970
Upon careful evaluation,

02:27.105 --> 02:29.313
it is this Councilman's opinion
that The Guild

02:29.441 --> 02:33.355
should officially reclassify
your EMA rating at a...

02:33.487 --> 02:35.649
- Level Five.
- Five?! Mother...

02:35.781 --> 02:38.194
Look, we know we're still
a little rough around the edges.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.987
But five's kinda low, isn't it?

02:40.118 --> 02:41.825
It is exceedingly generous!

02:41.953 --> 02:44.536
Mr. Monarch, it will take
more than a coat of paint

02:44.665 --> 02:45.951
to rise in our ranks.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.575
But what about
my amazing new flying fortress?!

02:48.710 --> 02:50.430
It's gotta be worth
at least a six or seven.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.662
Ah, yes... that.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.546
Five.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.805
Sweet.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.640
Let's do this.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.276
C'mon!

03:19.116 --> 03:20.732
Yeah.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.243
Hello, my lady-love.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.158
Just chillin'
in the new Hank pad,

03:26.289 --> 03:28.997
and there's just
one thing missing... you.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.206
Wanna come over and cuddle?

03:30.293 --> 03:32.205
Oh, sounds like fun,
but I got class.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.669
I'll say you do!

03:33.797 --> 03:36.255
- Class, beauty, brains...
- School, Hank.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.716
I have... What the fuck?

03:44.808 --> 03:46.424
Ah! Sorry.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.802
Traffic in this city
really grinds my nuts.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.769
Took one look
at this nice, open lawn

03:50.897 --> 03:52.638
and just had
to open Adrienne up.

03:52.774 --> 03:53.774
It's okay, Brock.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.062
I know what it's like
to feel bottled up inside.

03:56.194 --> 03:58.561
I know ya do, Dean.
And that's why...

03:58.697 --> 03:59.904
I want you to have her.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.818
Whoa. Really?

04:01.950 --> 04:03.236
No!
What are you... nuts?

04:03.368 --> 04:05.054
I thought you were supposed
to be the smart one.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.489
C'mon, grab your shit.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.872
- What the... Dude!
- Whoa!

04:14.004 --> 04:15.040
He... Hey!

04:15.172 --> 04:17.289
Is today the day
you're moving in?

04:17.423 --> 04:18.880
Y-Yeah.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.877
Um, Brock, this is
my roommate, Jared.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.719
- Jared...
- We... We've met.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.304
You fucking that thing?

04:25.432 --> 04:28.140
Wha... No! No.
I would n-never.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.351
No, this is my fightin' beaver!
Right?

04:30.479 --> 04:32.220
It's for cheering.
Not for...

04:32.355 --> 04:34.722
I'm... I'm gonna...
I should go... ahem...

04:34.858 --> 04:36.815
get dressed,
check on my student loans.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.026
Maybe it's better
the family didn't care enough

04:39.154 --> 04:40.235
to come see me off.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.980
Ah, c'mon, Dean.
They... They care.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.357
At least H.E.L.P.eR does.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.576
All Hank cares about
is getting my old room.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.741
And Pop's still sore I'm not
taking any science classes.

04:49.873 --> 04:52.911
Yeah, look, um, there's
something you should know.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.659
You don't have to say it, Brock.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.913
Your dad signed you up for
a shitload of science classes.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.756
We're in a shitstorm o' trouble,
Dr. Venture!

05:00.884 --> 05:03.968
Ven-Tech is still in the red
from the Gargantua-2 fiasco,

05:04.095 --> 05:07.133
and we spent a fortune gettin'
this here skyscraper seaworthy

05:07.265 --> 05:09.131
after yer pappy shanghaied her.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.805
So whatever
ye and yer junior science club

05:11.937 --> 05:14.054
have been cookin' up
down in spec sci,

05:14.189 --> 05:16.602
ya better produce some
measurable results right quick,

05:16.733 --> 05:19.020
or Ven-Tech's gonna go belly up!

05:19.152 --> 05:21.815
Well, gentlemen,

05:21.947 --> 05:24.360
there's only one thing left
to do.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.240
Uh...

05:26.368 --> 05:27.825
what are you doing there, Doc?

05:27.953 --> 05:29.364
Uh, wa...

05:30.080 --> 05:31.742
Oh, geez, Doc!

05:33.208 --> 05:35.791
"No measurable results," eh?

05:35.919 --> 05:38.002
What do you call this?!

05:38.129 --> 05:41.918
Uh, ain't that the doohickey
yer brother used to wear?

05:42.050 --> 05:44.167
No! Not... Not exactly.

05:44.302 --> 05:47.716
Gentlemen, I give you the future
of personal conveyance.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.009
And the future...

05:49.140 --> 05:51.177
belongs to Ven-Tech!

05:52.727 --> 05:55.435
Uh, you got a bit of a...

05:55.564 --> 05:58.523
Oh, geez!
Oh, look at yer leg!

05:58.650 --> 06:00.437
Nah, nah,
you don't wanna pull that... Oh!

06:00.569 --> 06:02.526
Oh, boy.

06:02.654 --> 06:03.861
Doc?

06:03.989 --> 06:07.027
Mm-hmm.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.070
And you're looking
to borrow how much?

06:09.202 --> 06:11.159
- $20 million.
- Oh, yeah.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.530
Which you would use to acquire
a new flying fortress,

06:13.665 --> 06:15.657
uniforms and equipment,
and, uh...

06:15.792 --> 06:17.704
- What is this item?
- Handy Dandy.

06:17.836 --> 06:20.294
Very difficult to acquire,
on account of the ambergris,

06:20.422 --> 06:23.085
but, I assure you,
it is essential to my work.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.505
Hmm.
No proof of income...

06:26.636 --> 06:28.343
Uh, he does own his own home.

06:28.471 --> 06:31.339
You're referring to the
condemned property in Newark?

06:31.474 --> 06:32.474
<i>Formerly</i> condemned.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.509
I spent a small fortune
fixing it up.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.135
Hence the business loan.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.888
Don't want to strain the ol'
trust fund too much, you know.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.024
A trust fund, you say?

06:40.025 --> 06:42.065
Do you happen to have
documentation on that account?

06:42.110 --> 06:44.523
No. <i>You</i> do. It's been at this
bank for, like, 40 years.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.691
- Look it up!
- Ah. Okay. Yes.

06:46.823 --> 06:47.904
Well, I see it here now.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.275
I do apologize,
Mr. Fitzcarraldo...

06:50.410 --> 06:53.278
Monarch. And no need to
apologize. Just gimme money.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.030
...but that account
is overdrawn.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.283
Overdrawn.
Overdrawn.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.874
Oh, okay.
Just try to breathe here.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.417
We can try
the Guild Credit Union,

07:04.549 --> 07:05.693
or maybe your wife
could give us...

07:05.717 --> 07:08.175
Go wait in the car.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.384
- What?
- Do it!

07:11.598 --> 07:13.681
Listen to me very carefully.

07:13.808 --> 07:16.175
You're going
to give me that money.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.223
Because this is a robbery!

07:18.355 --> 07:20.142
Everybody drop to the ground!

07:20.273 --> 07:23.812
I am an armed
and deadly supervillain!

07:23.944 --> 07:26.277
And if anyone tries
anything funny...

07:27.530 --> 07:28.530
...that happens!

07:28.615 --> 07:30.072
"Not in <i>my</i> parlor..."

07:30.200 --> 07:32.738
said the Spider
to the Butter-Fly.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.735
This bank is protected by...

07:34.871 --> 07:37.329
the Brown Widow!

07:37.457 --> 07:39.540
- Aw! Did that just come out...
- Widow kick!

07:42.212 --> 07:44.124
- Start the car!
- Going somewhere?

07:44.255 --> 07:46.042
Start the... Aaah!

07:49.177 --> 07:51.043
All right, everybody, listen up!

07:51.179 --> 07:53.045
My name is Professor Tompkins,

07:53.181 --> 07:54.922
and I'm gonna be
filling in for Dr. Nidaba

07:55.058 --> 07:57.345
while he is still incapacitated.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.015
- Hey, Bjorn Borg, you're late!
- Sorry.

08:00.146 --> 08:03.389
Little about me. I normally
teach U.S. Military History,

08:03.525 --> 08:06.142
and I'm head coach of
the Stuyvesant wrestling team...

08:06.277 --> 08:07.277
Go, Beavers!

08:07.278 --> 08:10.988
So I'm a little new to all this
namby-pamby philosophy crap.

08:11.116 --> 08:14.200
So, today, I'm gonna start
you out on the classics

08:14.327 --> 08:18.412
with a little help from visiting
professor Mr. Zack Snyder.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.576
Somehow I don't think
the moral of Plato's "Republic"

08:22.711 --> 08:25.044
was "kickin' ass
and takin' names."

08:25.171 --> 08:28.585
Yeah, no, but how cool
was it to see "300" again, huh?

08:28.717 --> 08:30.379
Dean? Dean Venture?

08:30.510 --> 08:32.126
Oh, my God!
I thought that was you.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.673
Oh. Hi, Sirena.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.842
- Hi, Sirena.
- Bye, Jared.

08:35.974 --> 08:37.326
"Bye, Jared."

08:37.350 --> 08:39.307
So, you're livin'
on campus now, huh?

08:39.436 --> 08:40.643
Oh, I'm so jelly.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.102
It's only, like, 50 blocks,
or whatever,

08:43.231 --> 08:45.223
but it's like a totally
different world up here.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.021
- Yeah. I sure hope so, anyway.
- Hey, where you headed?

08:48.153 --> 08:49.873
You wanna grab a cup of coffee
or something?

08:49.946 --> 08:51.653
Oh, uh, well, I-I can't.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.397
Oh, do you have
that same Hank thing,

08:53.533 --> 08:54.899
where coffee makes you crazy?

08:55.035 --> 08:57.948
No. I have to go cancel
all my science classes

08:58.079 --> 09:00.162
because my dad makes me crazy.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.156
Well, he's lucky to be alive.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.659
We were able to stop
the bleeding in time,

09:04.794 --> 09:06.535
but the glass nicked
his femoral artery,

09:06.671 --> 09:10.164
so we're gonna want to keep him
overnight for observation.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.134
Heckuva job bodyguarding there,
Samson.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.048
I had to drop Dean off.
Where were you?

09:15.180 --> 09:16.637
Where am I always?!

09:16.765 --> 09:18.006
Down at the front desk.

09:18.141 --> 09:20.383
A real soldier
never leaves his post.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.475
So, who's watching
the place now?

09:25.440 --> 09:27.147
Yeah,
I should probably get back.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.892
Uh, did... did Dean come?

09:30.028 --> 09:31.394
Where's my boy?

09:31.529 --> 09:33.316
He's at class, Doc.
First day.

09:33.448 --> 09:34.448
I'm here, though, Pop!

09:34.449 --> 09:35.760
And while I got you
in a groovy mood,

09:35.784 --> 09:37.025
I need a quick cash injection

09:37.160 --> 09:39.573
for, uh, some upgrades
I want to do to my new room.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.904
Now, I can keep the costs down

09:40.955 --> 09:42.675
by do-it-myself'ing
the paint and wallpaper,

09:42.749 --> 09:44.029
but frankly, I'm out of my depth

09:44.084 --> 09:46.872
- when it comes to this skylight.
- No, Hank. Just... no.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.414
I'm not giving you any money.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.546
Wh...? C'mon!

09:49.631 --> 09:51.418
You gave Dean his own checkbook!

09:51.549 --> 09:53.211
And I gave you a choice.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.834
Either you enrolled in school...

09:54.969 --> 09:56.447
- Well...
- Clown college doesn't count.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.007
Or you get a job.

09:58.139 --> 10:01.723
I'm sorry, gentlemen,
but visiting hours are over.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.309
You're free to come
back tonight, okay?

10:04.437 --> 10:05.437
Can I get one of those?

10:05.522 --> 10:07.980
Because while my dad
might be a billionaire,

10:08.108 --> 10:10.100
I don't have a pot to piss in!

10:10.235 --> 10:12.147
You're lucky I'm not
charging you rent, Hank!

10:12.278 --> 10:13.644
Wait.
Where are you going?

10:13.780 --> 10:15.646
Nurse, this man is my bodyguard.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.398
He's authorized
to stay the night.

10:17.534 --> 10:18.534
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.156
Wait.
Stay with me, Bro-o-o...

10:32.632 --> 10:34.043
It's bad.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.588
Hey, sweetie.
Rough day, huh?

10:41.015 --> 10:43.553
Yeah. New York is lousy
with superheroes.

10:43.685 --> 10:44.845
Y-You'll do better next time.

10:44.936 --> 10:48.304
You don't understand, baby.
There is no next time!

10:48.439 --> 10:51.648
I'm broke. Game over.
I have nothing left.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.187
You have me.
You have 21.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.652
- You have this beautiful house.
- You mean this money pit!

10:55.780 --> 10:58.238
What the hell was I thinking,
pouring all my...

10:58.366 --> 11:00.653
These sconces!
Look at these sconces.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.388
$1,200 apiece.

11:02.412 --> 11:03.493
Was I out of my mind?

11:03.621 --> 11:05.408
Okay, well, breaking them
isn't gonna...

11:05.540 --> 11:07.327
This vintage
rosewood executive desk

11:07.458 --> 11:08.744
by Arne Vodder for Sibast.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.288
$8,000!

11:10.420 --> 11:12.457
- Oh! Ohh!
- You're gonna get it all back.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.876
The Guild has assigned you
a cherry new arch.

11:15.008 --> 11:18.001
- Yeah, a cruddy Level Five.
- It's a start.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.469
Baby steps, sweetie.
Just work the program.

11:20.597 --> 11:23.214
Log some arches.
Earn your way up the ladder.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.807
- I-I can't.
- Yes, you can!

11:25.935 --> 11:28.803
Because you are
the Mighty Fucking Monarch.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.851
You're a survivor,
just like your namesake.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.440
Every spring, these little guys

11:33.568 --> 11:36.311
migrate thousands of miles
from Mexico to Canada.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.278
They average
maybe 50 miles a day,

11:38.406 --> 11:39.886
but, little by little,
they get there.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.690
And in the fall,
they pick themselves up,

11:41.826 --> 11:43.738
and they make
the long journey back.

11:43.870 --> 11:47.363
The point is, you can do
anything you set your mind to.

11:47.498 --> 11:50.912
Because Monarchs never quit.

11:52.420 --> 11:55.163
You're right.
Thank you, honey-bunny.

11:55.298 --> 11:57.540
I wish you could've met her
when she was alive.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.257
She would've liked you.

11:59.385 --> 12:02.844
I was quite excited
to see your name on my roster.

12:02.972 --> 12:06.056
I mean, your grandfather
was a huge inspiration to me.

12:06.184 --> 12:09.552
Well, thank you. But my father's
the real reason I'm here.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.457
Uh-huh. Yeah, I've, uh...
I've heard of him, too.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.768
See, he signed me up
for all these classes,

12:13.900 --> 12:16.643
and the truth is, I'm not
really interested in science.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.895
Oh, no?
What <i>are</i> you interested in?

12:19.030 --> 12:21.693
Well... I don't really know.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.565
That's kind of
why I'm in college.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.141
But I definitely know
that I don't...

12:25.203 --> 12:27.240
Want to be like your father.

12:27.372 --> 12:30.536
I myself was born the scion
of a powerful family.

12:30.667 --> 12:33.034
Daddy wanted me to go
into the family business.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.330
I can relate.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.954
With all due respect, Professor,
I don't think you can.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.090
It's not just him.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.461
It's his whole
super-science world.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.710
It's like it has its own gravity

12:42.845 --> 12:45.383
that just attracts
all these... these freaks,

12:45.515 --> 12:47.195
a-and if you're stuck
in his orbit, then...

12:47.225 --> 12:48.557
This was Pop.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.972
Pop wanted
only two things in life...

12:51.104 --> 12:54.563
to rule the world and to make
his son just like him.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.978
Uh, also to destroy
Dr. Atomicus,

12:57.110 --> 12:58.476
so three...
three things in life.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.194
- Y-Your father was a s...
- Big-time.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.188
And, man, did he mess me up.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.281
I went to a really dark place

13:05.410 --> 13:06.992
when I wasn't
much older than you.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.361
But you know what saved me?

13:08.496 --> 13:10.362
The power of science.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.080
Not the kind of power
he was after.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.542
I'm talking about the power to
make the world a better place,

13:15.670 --> 13:17.377
the power to help mankind.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.121
That's the kind of power
you need

13:19.257 --> 13:20.543
if you want to escape gravity.

13:20.675 --> 13:23.463
- I-I want.
- Then tell you what.

13:23.594 --> 13:26.883
You take just one of my classes,
see if you like it,

13:27.015 --> 13:28.506
and we move on from there?

13:28.641 --> 13:30.303
Well... okay.

13:30.435 --> 13:33.428
What's the least
super-science-y class you have?

13:33.563 --> 13:35.429
All science is super,
young Dean.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.147
- Uhh...
- Uh, botany.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.732
Let's try you on botany.

13:39.444 --> 13:42.061
The communal areas are
for your lounging enjoyment.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.937
You'll find the kitchen
one level down

13:44.073 --> 13:45.689
and stocked with snacks aplenty.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.316
The shared bathroom
is conveniently

13:47.452 --> 13:49.318
across the hall
from your room...

13:49.454 --> 13:52.788
and here is
your honeymoon suite!

13:54.500 --> 13:55.500
Uh, questions?

13:55.585 --> 13:58.453
Uh... are you having ze Wi-Fis?

13:58.588 --> 14:01.331
Ah! Yes. Our network's
named "Rust-4-Life,"

14:01.466 --> 14:04.129
and the password is... Huh.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.343
"Kate-Jackson-Meow"?

14:06.471 --> 14:07.781
Please don't share it
with anyone.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.922
'Cause it's embarrassing.
So, there's just the matter

14:10.058 --> 14:11.845
of your, uh... ahem... rent.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.593
It's $250 per night,
plus the $30 cleaning fee...

14:14.729 --> 14:16.095
Cash! Aces.

14:16.230 --> 14:19.143
Well, I hope
you enjoy your stay,

14:19.275 --> 14:21.892
and thanks again
for choosing AirB&Me...

14:22.028 --> 14:24.645
a wholly-owned subsidiary
of HankCo.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.826
Hey, <i>mami.</i>
I like what I see.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.616
Ugh.
Piss off, you pervert.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.705
Aw, why you gotta be like that?

14:35.833 --> 14:37.199
I mean it, you dickhead.

14:37.335 --> 14:39.702
- I've got Mace!
- And I've got flowers!

14:39.837 --> 14:42.375
Hank! Jesus!
What are you doing here?

14:42.507 --> 14:44.624
I suddenly found myself
flush with cash

14:44.759 --> 14:46.796
and wanted to share
the wealth with my best gal.

14:46.928 --> 14:49.261
What say we paint the town?
You name the color.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.005
Aww, that's sweet, boo-boo.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.348
But I told you... I got class.

14:53.476 --> 14:54.842
But that was this morning.

14:54.977 --> 14:56.218
Yeah, I got more than one.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.220
- It's college.
- Well, that seems excessive.

14:58.356 --> 15:00.689
Look, I-I gotta go.
I'm gonna be late.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.059
We will do something
this weekend, okay?

15:03.194 --> 15:04.194
I promise.

15:04.278 --> 15:07.521
Uh, o... o-kay.

15:08.449 --> 15:12.068
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

15:12.203 --> 15:14.320
- Hey, how do I look?
- You look good.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.321
Well... except don't
do that with your face.

15:16.457 --> 15:17.789
Ugh! Can't help it.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.704
This gel, it's just so stiff.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.327
I need pliable hold!

15:21.462 --> 15:23.749
At least you don't look like
Piter De Vries anymore.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.668
Who the hell is Piter... Oh!

15:25.800 --> 15:27.837
He's from one of
your geek things, isn't he?

15:27.969 --> 15:30.086
So, uh, what's the deal
with this new arch?

15:30.221 --> 15:31.221
Is he cool or what?

15:31.347 --> 15:34.090
"Professor Victor Von Helping."

15:34.225 --> 15:36.558
- Oh. Guess not.
- Helping. So cheesy.

15:36.686 --> 15:39.645
"Dean of Sciences, Stuyvesant
University," blah-blah-blah.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.685
"Active member of Greenpeace,
Doctors Without Borders."

15:42.817 --> 15:44.149
Oh, shit!

15:44.277 --> 15:45.984
Oh, my God.
Guess whose kid he is.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.946
Holy!
Is that Vigo Von Hellfire?!

15:49.073 --> 15:50.564
He's, like, Guild royalty.

15:50.700 --> 15:51.941
Apparently, little Victor

15:52.076 --> 15:53.716
was being groomed
for the family business,

15:53.744 --> 15:55.280
but had a change of heart after

15:55.413 --> 15:58.747
"a freak super-science accident
left him hideously scarred

15:58.875 --> 16:00.537
on over 80% of his body."

16:00.668 --> 16:03.081
Ew. Is he all melty-looking
and stuff?

16:03.212 --> 16:06.080
- No. He looks fine.
- Huh. Handsome, even.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.332
In, like,
a Paul Atreides kind of way.

16:08.468 --> 16:12.382
- Geek! Geek! Geek!
- Sorry! Sorry!

16:16.851 --> 16:18.308
Hiya, stranger.

16:18.436 --> 16:19.597
We botany buddies?

16:19.729 --> 16:21.415
I thought
you was quittin' science.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.396
No.
Just my dad's kind of science.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.640
Ugh!
Tell me about it.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.892
My dad tried to push me
into marine biology,

16:27.028 --> 16:28.308
but, like,
no, fucking thank you.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.520
Are you out of your mind?

16:29.655 --> 16:31.455
That didn't work out
so hot for him, you know?

16:31.532 --> 16:33.865
- Or me, to be quite honest.
- I know, right?

16:33.993 --> 16:36.485
It's like they don't even see
what their whole obsession

16:36.621 --> 16:38.578
with super-science
is doing to their own kids.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.948
You know I'm a clone?
Me and Hank both.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.325
- Yeah, I know. He told me.
- How messed up is that?!

16:43.461 --> 16:45.623
Not as messed up
as being, like, dead.

16:45.755 --> 16:46.871
So, you know...

16:47.006 --> 16:48.588
maybe super-science
ain't all bad.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.799
Brr! Hoo!
It's a brisk one out there!

16:50.927 --> 16:52.463
Sorry I'm late, students.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.177
Ah! Well.

16:54.305 --> 16:56.012
Looks like it's just
the three of us, then.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.678
Not anymore!

16:58.809 --> 17:01.222
The Monarch
is auditing this class!

17:03.814 --> 17:05.601
Oh! Hey.
Hey, Dean Venture!

17:05.733 --> 17:08.851
No, no, no, no!

17:27.463 --> 17:28.499
Hank.

17:28.631 --> 17:31.339
Hey, Pop?
You awake?

17:35.596 --> 17:38.054
Well, hello
there, son. How was your day?

17:38.182 --> 17:40.094
Honestly, it started good,

17:40.226 --> 17:42.559
but it turned out to be
kind of a bummer.

17:42.687 --> 17:45.087
Well, that
doesn't sound very Hank of you.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.792
Yeah, well,
it ain't easy maintaining

17:46.816 --> 17:48.227
my famous can-do attitude

17:48.359 --> 17:51.227
when you're always
all "can't-don't" to me.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.938
I don't get it.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.905
I mean, Dean cuts and runs
on Team Venture,

17:56.033 --> 17:57.649
and you give him
whatever he wants.

17:57.785 --> 18:00.152
But I stick around,
and you punish me for it.

18:00.288 --> 18:01.950
I mean, I know
he's your favorite,

18:02.081 --> 18:03.447
but do you have to act like it?

18:03.583 --> 18:06.576
- ♪ Take my hand ♪
- You know...

18:06.711 --> 18:09.044
I just feel so...

18:09.171 --> 18:11.003
kind of alone now that...

18:12.049 --> 18:13.130
What <i>is</i> that?

18:13.259 --> 18:17.299
♪ Take my hand,
I can take you there ♪

18:17.430 --> 18:20.639
♪ I'm feeling kinda fragile
'cause I... ♪

18:20.766 --> 18:24.055
They...
They say that music helps.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.471
See?

18:27.607 --> 18:30.600
I-I heard music.

18:30.735 --> 18:31.976
Am I dreaming?

18:32.111 --> 18:33.852
It's no dream, Pop.
It's...

18:33.988 --> 18:36.401
Wait a minute.
Uh, how much did you hear?

18:36.532 --> 18:38.398
You really came to see me?

18:38.534 --> 18:40.696
Yeah.
I-I guess I did.

18:40.828 --> 18:41.828
Aww.

18:41.954 --> 18:45.243
I want you to know
you've always been my favorite.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.661
I love you...

18:49.003 --> 18:51.336
...Kate Jackson.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.705
Hank?!

18:52.840 --> 18:54.172
It's game night, man!

18:54.300 --> 18:56.383
I'm comin' for that flat-screen!

18:57.219 --> 18:59.836
- What are you doin'?
- Alarm went off in Hank's room.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.338
That ain't Hank's room anymore.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.557
And Hank went out an hour ago.

19:04.602 --> 19:05.683
We go in on three.

19:05.811 --> 19:06.927
One...

19:07.063 --> 19:08.224
Three!

19:14.278 --> 19:15.769
No. Nothing.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.942
Where is it, Von Hippie?

19:18.074 --> 19:20.282
Where is what?
It's a botany lab.

19:20.409 --> 19:23.197
Is this some kind
of rush-week prank?

19:23.329 --> 19:26.788
No, we're your new arches,
you condescending putz!

19:26.916 --> 19:30.205
We're here to fight you
and steal your shit!

19:30.336 --> 19:32.498
Well, I'm not going
to fight you.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.270
Okay, that'll work.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.376
Aah! Mother...

19:35.508 --> 19:37.795
Nice.
Step aside, you child.

19:37.927 --> 19:40.135
Ow!

19:40.262 --> 19:41.628
This is absolutely broken!

19:41.764 --> 19:44.097
- Why is there metal...
- This is just fucking sad.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.387
Shut up!
21! Grab her!

19:46.519 --> 19:48.476
- Dude, that's Wide Wale's dau...
- Do it!

19:49.438 --> 19:50.724
- Really?
- Hey!

19:50.856 --> 19:52.848
Now give us
your secret science shit!

19:52.983 --> 19:54.224
Or my Number 2's gonna go

19:54.360 --> 19:55.712
"Mama had a baby,
and its head popped off"

19:55.736 --> 19:57.693
on your little dandelion here!

19:57.822 --> 19:59.154
Enough!

19:59.281 --> 20:00.897
Do as you like to me,

20:01.033 --> 20:05.323
but you do not
threaten my students!

20:05.454 --> 20:07.741
You wanted to get
a rise out of me.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.616
- Hey.
- Well, how do you like me now?!

20:10.751 --> 20:13.494
How do you like facing
the full wrath

20:13.629 --> 20:16.793
of
Professor Victor Von Hellfire?!

20:16.924 --> 20:18.276
No, no.
No, please, Professor!

20:18.300 --> 20:20.166
Don't let him drag you
down to his level.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.339
- Hey!
- What's it gonna take, Monarch?!

20:22.471 --> 20:26.340
Huh?! To rid my life of creeps
like you once and for all?!

20:26.475 --> 20:29.013
Why do you even do this?!
Do you even know anymore?!

20:29.145 --> 20:31.182
Oh, what do you know,
rich bitch?!

20:31.313 --> 20:32.679
You never had to work
for a living.

20:32.815 --> 20:34.898
Taking shit arches
instead of doing

20:35.025 --> 20:36.436
what you really want to do!

20:36.569 --> 20:38.356
Or hating
who you really want to hate!

20:38.487 --> 20:42.197
Fine! There's only one way
to end this, then, isn't there?

20:42.324 --> 20:43.360
Gun!

20:43.492 --> 20:46.405
One... million...

20:46.537 --> 20:47.537
dollars.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.495
There!
Is that gonna be enough

20:49.623 --> 20:51.364
for you to leave
my professor alone?

20:51.500 --> 20:53.457
To leave me alone? Huh?!

20:53.586 --> 20:56.124
Well, I... Uh, yeah?

20:56.255 --> 20:58.497
Then... Oh.
Uh, okay.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.544
T-That okay with you, Professor?

21:00.676 --> 21:03.168
I should be calling
<i>you</i> professor.

21:03.304 --> 21:05.216
Because you've taught me
something here tonight,

21:05.347 --> 21:06.838
- young Dean.
- Oh, my God!

21:06.974 --> 21:09.432
Can we please leave
this after-school special?

21:09.560 --> 21:11.973
Oh, uh, but, first,
can we get you to sign this?

21:12.104 --> 21:14.471
Standard Guild form 4-B,
arch confirmation...

21:14.607 --> 21:18.317
Oh, of course. Oh.
I seem to have lost my pen.

21:18.444 --> 21:21.278
- Hey, are you okay?
- Oh, please, are you kidding me?

21:21.405 --> 21:23.772
I grew up
around Level Nines and Tens.

21:23.908 --> 21:26.070
These guys are,
like, negative threes.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.444
I dunno what they were.
That was an embarrassment.

21:28.579 --> 21:31.447
Um, but you're...
but you're so sweet for asking.

21:31.582 --> 21:33.949
My hero.

21:34.084 --> 21:36.622
Oh! Oh, come on.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.620
It was nothin'. I didn't...

21:41.550 --> 21:42.550
Oh, no!

22:10.830 --> 22:15.040
Top earner for the month!
Oh, so proud!

22:15.167 --> 22:16.499
I knew you could do it, honey.

22:16.627 --> 22:18.163
Even Z was impressed.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.332
He sent this over.

22:28.430 --> 22:29.546
Geek!
