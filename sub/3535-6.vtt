WEBVTT

00:06.759 --> 00:08.599
All right, stop right there. Let's roll that back.

00:08.679 --> 00:10.039
- That one bit.

00:10.119 --> 00:12.480
to stop monkeying around.

00:12.560 --> 00:15.759
- Kenny's cutting in.

00:15.839 --> 00:17.839
<i>No, that's all right, Ken. We're good over here.</i>
<i>We're cool.</i>

00:17.920 --> 00:19.359
- We're good. Sit back down.

00:19.440 --> 00:20.839
Oh. Guy, let me take this.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.199
If there's one thing I know,

00:23.280 --> 00:33.399
- it's monkey business.

00:33.479 --> 00:38.200
Clarence, can you come in here? I'd love
to show you something.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.439
Take a break, Alan.

00:39.520 --> 00:44.880
I... I just wanna get some fresh eyes on it.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.479
I want you to watch this.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.280
Tell me what you think.

00:48.359 --> 00:49.399
Oh yeah. Is that right?

00:49.479 --> 00:51.000
Do you have a special relationship

00:51.079 --> 00:53.439
<i>- with monkeys, do you? - Well, you know</i>
<i>I got people in Atlanta.</i>

00:53.520 --> 00:57.079
<i>-And they all love Skittles,</i>
<i>red...</i>

00:57.159 --> 00:59.560
- You think that bit's funny? - Well, the audience
seems to like it.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.600
Yeah. What... What is it
about him that's funny?

01:01.679 --> 01:04.159
stupid white people that
just say anything

01:04.239 --> 01:06.200
and they do anything
and they just funny.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.280
How are the grandkids?

01:08.359 --> 01:09.640
Well, thank you for asking,
Mr. Young.

01:09.719 --> 01:11.439
- They're doing great.
- Oh, good, good.

01:11.519 --> 01:13.480
- Can you send them a message for me?
- Sure.

01:13.560 --> 01:16.159
Yeah. Can you tell them that grandpa has
a terrible sense of humor

01:16.239 --> 01:18.599
and that he laughs at the
stupidest fucking shit ever.

01:18.680 --> 01:22.040
And that's why there won't be any gifts under the
Christmas
tree this year from Grandpa.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.920
I don't understand.
What are you talking about?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.599
- You don't understand?
- No.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.719
You're fired!
Get the fuck outta here.

01:28.799 --> 01:31.920
- You're crazy.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.120
Oh! A soccer ball.

02:15.199 --> 02:17.240
What a nice gift from
Aunt April and Uncle Kenny.

02:17.319 --> 02:19.000
<i>Feliz cumpleaos,</i>
<i>you little motherfucker.</i>

02:19.080 --> 02:20.800
this gift, Kenny.

02:20.879 --> 02:22.800
He's going to enjoy it a lot.
Thank you so much...

02:22.879 --> 02:23.879
It-it... it's cool.
It's fine. We get it.

02:23.960 --> 02:25.840
He likes it. That's great.

02:25.919 --> 02:28.120
Who wants so more nachos? Hey, kids.
Y'all want some nachos?

02:28.199 --> 02:30.719
No. I don't think they want any more nachos.
I think they're really tired.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.960
And I gotta be honest,
I got a headache.

02:33.039 --> 02:34.560
- Oh, a headache, huh?
- Yeah.

02:34.639 --> 02:36.560
Oh, isn't that convenient.
Huh.

02:36.639 --> 02:39.159
I don't really know what you have to be
so unhappy about, April. -

02:39.240 --> 02:41.639
You got beautiful children,
a wealthy husband,

02:41.719 --> 02:43.400
loving friends.

02:43.479 --> 02:45.319
We don't have any friends,
you see?

02:45.400 --> 02:47.319
- You've driven everybody away.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.479
What's Stevie's family,
chopped liver?

02:48.560 --> 02:50.759
They might not be hipsters
like Gene and Dixie,

02:50.840 --> 02:52.759
but that doesn't make them
less of people, all right?

02:52.840 --> 02:54.840
- I'm gonna throw you a hail mary right now.
- Uh-huh.

02:54.919 --> 02:57.599
If there's anything that can turn your mood
around, maybe it's this.

02:57.680 --> 03:01.319
My good friend, blackie, would like to take you
anywhere you wanna go.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.280
Wash away your worries
and go hang out with blackie.

03:03.360 --> 03:06.240
Let me tell you something. I don't give a shit
about the money.

03:06.319 --> 03:09.879
If you do not help with this marriage
and wanna work on it,

03:09.960 --> 03:12.879
and give the best effort
possible,

03:12.960 --> 03:15.400
- then we're gonna have to look at other options.
- Other options?

03:15.479 --> 03:16.919
- Yeah. - Hmm. What would those be,
maybe divorce?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.639
- No. That's not what I want.
- No, no.

03:18.719 --> 03:20.199
That seems like what you're hinting at. So let's
walk that one through.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.039
So we get divorced,
I split.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.960
And then we get another
jackoff to come in here

03:24.039 --> 03:26.080
and support the whole entire family like I do.
That sounds great.

03:26.159 --> 03:27.879
How about this roller-skating
nerd right here?

03:27.960 --> 03:30.479
Welcome to Jellybeans.
Can I... take your trash?

03:30.560 --> 03:32.000
I think we're good with
all the trash here right now.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.599
I have a simple question
for you though.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.360
Would you like to marry my wife and fund her
fancy-ass lifestyle?

03:36.439 --> 03:37.680
We're just having
a conversation.

03:37.759 --> 03:38.639
- You can...
- We're all good.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.960
- Thank you.
- So we're good?

03:40.039 --> 03:41.680
We're good then, huh?

03:41.759 --> 03:44.400
Divorce is for losers, April.
We're not losers.

03:44.479 --> 03:47.639
This is a wonderful day.

03:47.719 --> 03:50.120
Toby, can I holler
at you for a moment?

03:50.199 --> 03:51.240
Get your opinion
on something?

03:51.319 --> 03:52.719
Mmm. Yeah.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.800
I know we both love Mommy.
She's cool, right?

03:54.879 --> 03:57.319
You notice anything
weird about her lately?

03:57.400 --> 03:58.840
She's kinda acting like,
a little crazy.

03:58.919 --> 04:00.960
Like, maybe like, mentally ill.
I don't know.

04:01.039 --> 04:02.479
Maybe it's not
a chemical thing.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.000
I hate to say it but...
maybe she just sucks.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.479
I mean, maybe I just married
somebody who sucks.

04:07.560 --> 04:10.479
Honestly, I'm just getting sick and tired of all
the damn head games, man.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.599
Just... the withholdings
of affection.

04:12.680 --> 04:16.120
Them skin-colored panties she has with the
skidmarks
with the busting elastic.

04:16.199 --> 04:17.639
I mean, that's like a
middle finger to my libido.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.040
- You know what libido is?
- No.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.439
It's like these little beans inside of you
that make you horny.

04:22.519 --> 04:24.279
These ladies
can't push the men around.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.680
We've gotta be number one
in the house, you understand me?

04:26.759 --> 04:28.639
- Yep.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.519
Oh, I feel you, Dakota.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.639
Wild animal stuck
in the chains of suburbia.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.959
Huh. Reminds me of me.

04:35.040 --> 04:38.079
That's what's so badass
about pro wrestling.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.439
I mean, it's the only sport where
there's no official uniform.

04:40.519 --> 04:42.399
I mean, you can come in with
jean shorts and be like,

04:42.480 --> 04:44.279
- "That's part of my character."

04:44.360 --> 04:48.959
Whoa. I'm sounding the boring alarm. Guy's tossing
it up.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.680
- "Guy's tossing it up,"
what's that?

04:50.759 --> 04:52.720
That's something I'm saying now.
It's my new catchphrase.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.399
Let's move on before this guy
puts us all to sleep.

04:55.480 --> 04:57.319
We have a very special guest
for you today.

04:57.399 --> 04:59.279
She would never stab me
in the back.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.240
And most of all, she's the funniest chick I know.
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:01.319 --> 05:04.600
Put your hands together
for a true wild card,

05:04.680 --> 05:13.199
tennis great, Candi Cox.

05:13.279 --> 05:15.639
Candi Cox.
There she is.

05:15.720 --> 05:18.319
A-ha-ha-ha.

05:18.399 --> 05:21.959
Holla!

05:22.040 --> 05:23.600
- Holla!
- What's up, girl?

05:23.680 --> 05:26.560
Candi Cox in the hiz-ouse!

05:26.639 --> 05:29.079
- Twerk it. Twerk it. Twerk it.
- Twerk it. Twerk it.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.199
That's inappropriate.

05:30.279 --> 05:31.959
Ha-ha. What's up, girl?

05:32.040 --> 05:33.920
- Good to see you.
- Hey.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.720
- Queen of the clay, right?
- Oh, I'm a huge fan of yours.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.920
- Thank you.
we're all big fans of yours.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.560
You're a beautiful lady
and an even better talent.

05:41.639 --> 05:44.399
I mean, what an athlete. Candi, I don't know if
you've
ever met Kenny.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.639
- Kenny, Candi. - Of course.
Kenny Powers, right?

05:46.720 --> 05:48.319
Yeah. You're damn right.

05:48.399 --> 05:50.519
Yeah, I have a friend in San Francisco,
used to date you.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.000
That's no big surprise. I tore through
my fair share of ladies

05:53.079 --> 05:54.399
when I did my time
in San Fran.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.600
- Yeah. Except it was a dude.
- Oh! Oh!

05:57.680 --> 06:00.079
- He said you was a twink man.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.000
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

06:02.079 --> 06:03.120
with a twink man?

06:03.199 --> 06:04.319
- What is it, twink man?
- No. No.

06:04.399 --> 06:06.720
I don't like young and
handsome dudes, all right.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.120
a little older?
- No. No, I don't like any.

06:09.199 --> 06:11.279
Everyone settle down.
I know what Candi's problem is.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.600
- Candi's on her period.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.879
I mean, I see all these
house flies buzzing around.

06:14.959 --> 06:17.800
they can smell those eggs
bleeding out your pussy.

06:17.879 --> 06:20.399
- Whoa, man.
No, no, no, no. No, no.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.079
- Kenny, have some respect, man. - Ovulation is
nature's
only miracle.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.560
- I can't talk about that? - Kenny, you don't talk
about
a lady's menstrual cycle.

06:25.639 --> 06:27.839
- I don't think it's fair. - Kenny, knock it off.
You're digging a ditch.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.040
- Not fair. - I'd like to apologize
to everybody out there

06:30.120 --> 06:31.920
- in the audience. We'll be right back.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.160
- OK? We're gonna wash Kenny's mouth out with
soap.
- Not me. Not apologizing.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.399
- No, you're not. - And when we get back,
we'll continue the show.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.399
- Very uncool.
- And we're clear.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.000
- What the fuck is this?

06:40.079 --> 06:41.560
- Oh, man.
- Kenny Powers is going 10-1.

06:41.639 --> 06:43.439
- Fucking cock gobbler.
- Hey.

06:43.519 --> 06:45.160
We don't make fun of
homosexuals on this show.

06:45.240 --> 06:53.120
That's rule one, OK? Gays are the new blacks.
Get with it.

06:53.199 --> 06:54.199
- When's your next tournament.
- September.

06:54.279 --> 06:56.360
- September? All right.
- Yeah.

06:56.439 --> 06:58.040
- Come on, you motherfucker.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.399
<i>Don't be rattled.</i>
<i>Man, you got this shit.</i>

06:59.480 --> 07:01.800
Candi Cox. Of course
they're laughing.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.959
They're just being
fucking kind to her ass.

07:04.040 --> 07:04.920
Coming out here twerking.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.720
<i>Fucking that broad comedy.</i>
<i>Fuck that bitch.</i>

07:06.800 --> 07:07.680
- You got the cock, bro.

07:07.759 --> 07:08.759
<i>You're the one</i>
<i>with the cock.</i>

07:08.839 --> 07:10.399
Use the fucking cock.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.639
You fucking go out there.
You be confident, man.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.519
The audience is loving your fucking vibe, bro.
Just fucking harness that.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.319
-Just fucking radiate coolness.

07:17.399 --> 07:20.199
<i>Fucking comedy.</i>
<i>Sexual energy. Masculinity.</i>

07:20.279 --> 07:23.319
You are handsome.
You are loved. You are strong.

07:23.399 --> 07:31.000
- Mm-hmm.

07:31.079 --> 07:32.839
What the hell's so funny?

07:32.920 --> 07:34.759
Candi Cox telling more
of her stupid jokes?

07:34.839 --> 07:36.639
I guess they're just digging
your vibe, you know.

07:36.720 --> 07:42.759
They're impressed with how
strong and powerful you are.

07:42.839 --> 07:49.319
- four, three...
- Hot mic, champ.

07:49.399 --> 07:52.920
Look at them titties, girl.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.759
Ohh, I love how big they are.
They're like two big potatoes.

07:56.839 --> 08:00.720
- Two big old potatoes. Perfect. - Stevie, what
the fuck
is this shit?

08:00.800 --> 08:02.519
Oh, yo, dog. Check it.

08:02.600 --> 08:06.519
I got Maria selling baked potatoes
like nobody's business.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.439
What did I tell you, man? I said the only girls
who can work here

08:08.519 --> 08:12.160
- gotta be hot chicks, man. - Yeah, but you didn't
specify
which hot chicks.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.000
And I gotta pay for
Maria's new boob job...

08:15.079 --> 08:16.120
...somehow.

08:16.199 --> 08:17.720
Maria got a boob job,
I didn't even notice.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.600
I don't look at her
in a sexual manner. Ever.

08:19.680 --> 08:20.639
Show him. Show him.

08:20.720 --> 08:25.480
Make Daddy proud.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.399
- Impressive.
Actually, not bad.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.279
Kinda evens you out
a little bit. OK...

08:29.360 --> 08:33.000
There's a lot of children
walking around Rack Room Shoes.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.320
Check it.
I got Maria working for us,

08:35.399 --> 08:38.960
with those titties. Pimp style. This is what pimps
do.

08:39.039 --> 08:40.240
Well, they better work.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.120
I'm starting to second guess
this whole entire kiosk.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.679
Yeah. Guy Young has me
in his cross hairs.

08:44.759 --> 08:46.200
Trying to Dontel my ass.

08:46.279 --> 08:48.240
Kenny, I thought you said
you couldn't lose.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.480
I thought you had this on lockdown.
I need this gig.

08:50.559 --> 08:52.279
- Ow! - You don't think
I need this?

08:52.360 --> 08:55.679
I invested 5.7 thousand dollars
into this kiosk.

08:55.759 --> 08:58.000
Fuck, Kenny. I know, I know.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.000
My mind's everywhere.
How can I be a CEO

09:00.080 --> 09:01.879
when I'm fighting two goddamn
battles on different fronts.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.559
At home my marriage
is shitting the bed

09:03.639 --> 09:04.720
and at work I'm dealing
with a military coup.

09:04.799 --> 09:06.200
If we don't act fast,
Guy Young

09:06.279 --> 09:08.799
is gonna burn everything
we love to the ground.

09:08.879 --> 09:10.519
OK. OK, OK.
This is what we do.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.399
Let me take care
of Guy Young.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.440
And you, you deal with your
fucked up marriage at home.

09:14.519 --> 09:16.759
I will personally
neutralize his ass.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.200
- Can I trust you with this?
- Oh yeah.

09:18.279 --> 09:21.120
I'm gonna skin him alive and
make a lamp out of his skin.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.679
All right, Hannibal Lecter.
Settle down, all right.

09:22.759 --> 09:24.840
We don't start with that, all right?
That's a last resort. 0

09:24.919 --> 09:26.960
At this point, I think we just need
to send him a message.

09:27.039 --> 09:28.200
Plain and simple.

09:28.279 --> 09:31.559
Nobody messes with me.
Nobody messes with you.

09:31.639 --> 09:35.559
And nobody...
messes with Maria's titties.

09:35.639 --> 09:38.480
<i>Is she gonna work today or is she gonna just sit</i>
<i>there</i>
<i>and eat fuckingpapas?</i>

09:38.559 --> 09:40.240
No, she's working.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.240
I doo-doo-doo what to do

09:43.320 --> 09:46.000
Next time I fall

09:46.080 --> 09:51.159
In love

09:51.240 --> 09:53.639
The next time I fall

09:53.720 --> 09:56.480
- In love

09:56.559 --> 10:03.360
Next time I fall...

10:03.440 --> 10:05.200
Dixie.

10:05.279 --> 10:08.919
very odd that I'd be
asking you for advice

10:09.000 --> 10:10.879
when your life's in
fucking utter ruins.

10:10.960 --> 10:13.159
But you're my last resort.

10:13.240 --> 10:15.159
When's the first time
you realized

10:15.240 --> 10:17.960
that your marriage was...

10:18.039 --> 10:19.600
up shit creek
without a paddle.

10:19.679 --> 10:21.759
Well, when you
revealed to me

10:21.840 --> 10:24.759
that my husband was unfaithful and
addicted to drugs.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.879
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Mm-hmm. Course.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.960
But before that. Like, were there any,
like, signs or anything?

10:31.039 --> 10:33.759
No. Honestly,
there wasn't one.

10:33.840 --> 10:35.679
That was the weirdest part.

10:35.759 --> 10:39.000
Why do you ask?

10:39.080 --> 10:42.480
Yep. She's being
fucking super crazy.

10:42.559 --> 10:47.519
Talking about how she's unhappy and wanting
to seek other options

10:47.600 --> 10:48.919
Oh my God.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.120
Settle down. Don't get
all horny over my debacles.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.720
No. I'm not. I'm just...
What on earth happened?

10:53.799 --> 10:55.200
You guys were so
good together.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.440
I don't know. That's what I'm
coming to you for.

10:57.519 --> 10:59.320
You're her friend.
What's she saying?

10:59.399 --> 11:00.960
You know. Is she
going through menopause?

11:01.039 --> 11:02.360
She losing her memories?

11:02.440 --> 11:04.639
Did a fucked up evil version
of her from the future come

11:04.720 --> 11:05.519
and fucking try
to ruin my shit?

11:05.600 --> 11:08.159
No. Nothing.
I mean,

11:08.240 --> 11:10.519
everybody thought that
you were gonna dump her.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.399
What the fuck?
Who... Who's everyone?

11:13.480 --> 11:14.799
You know, the group.

11:14.879 --> 11:17.399
You were just always gone,
married to your job.

11:17.480 --> 11:18.960
I think everybody
just assumed that

11:19.039 --> 11:21.000
you were maybe moving on
to a younger girl.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.720
Jesus Christ! I mean, yes, of course,
I could do those things.

11:23.799 --> 11:26.000
But I choose not to.
I'm a good Christian white man.

11:26.080 --> 11:29.440
- Ugh. Sickening. - I can't believe
she's leaving you.

11:29.519 --> 11:30.879
Hold your role, she ain't
leaving me, all right?

11:30.960 --> 11:32.600
I'm bout to nip this shit
in the butt.

11:32.679 --> 11:34.679
Kenny Powers is not getting
a fucking divorce.

11:34.759 --> 11:38.360
I just gotta remind April
how dope her fucking life is.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.120
I know we've had our
differences in the past,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.639
but I may need your assistance
in the days to come.

11:42.720 --> 11:45.879
- I can't lose my wife. - Sure.
I'll do what I can, Kenny.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.600
No... OK, yeah. That's
what I'm asking you for.

11:47.679 --> 11:50.159
You know, this is
actually nice, us chatting.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.159
It's been hard since
Gene's been gone.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.799
- You know, for me, it's been a lot of...
- Shhh.

11:54.879 --> 11:56.840
Don't run your mouth too much.
It's not attractive.

11:56.919 --> 11:58.240
This is about me right now.

11:58.320 --> 12:04.120
I got big problems going on.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.039
Oh, and, Dixie-noodles.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.519
There's one more thing
you should know.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.120
Gene never...

12:10.200 --> 12:11.679
He...

12:11.759 --> 12:13.840
He never came
inside that woman.

12:13.919 --> 12:16.559
After a few pumps,
he withdrew his penis

12:16.639 --> 12:17.960
and he started smashing it

12:18.039 --> 12:21.759
between the ring and the lid of the toilet
for penance.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.559
He still loves you.

12:23.639 --> 12:26.080
You should give him
a second shot.

12:26.159 --> 12:34.480
Thanks for your help.

12:34.559 --> 12:40.399
<i>Just a closer walk</i>
<i>with Thee</i>

12:40.480 --> 12:43.480
<i>Grant it, Jesus,</i>
<i>if you please...</i>

12:43.559 --> 12:46.960
This dude is the answer
to our Guy Young problem.

12:47.039 --> 12:49.240
Look how ginormous he is.

12:49.320 --> 12:52.320
Well, it's no doubt this
gentlemen has acromegalia.

12:52.399 --> 12:55.200
I just wonder if he's gonna be
big enough for Guy Young.

12:55.279 --> 12:56.200
Guy Young ain't no scrub.

12:56.279 --> 12:57.759
this guy ain't no scrub.

12:57.840 --> 13:01.000
He knows mixed martial arts,
professional wrestling.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.480
Sports. All that stuff.

13:03.559 --> 13:06.919
<i>I am weak,</i>
<i>but Thou art strong</i>

13:07.000 --> 13:09.399
He does have
a beautiful voice.

13:09.480 --> 13:12.279
Jesus, keep me

13:12.360 --> 13:14.799
- From all wrong

13:14.879 --> 13:17.039
What we're primarily looking to do here
is send a message, OK?

13:17.120 --> 13:18.519
Don't fuck him up too bad.

13:18.600 --> 13:19.799
Stevie, does he know
what he's supposed to say?

13:19.879 --> 13:21.759
Yeah. Say your line, Joel.

13:21.840 --> 13:25.159
Hello, Guy Young.
I am a sports fans...

13:25.240 --> 13:28.639
- That being said...
- That being said,

13:28.720 --> 13:31.399
- I would appreciate it if you would give Kenny
Powers

13:31.480 --> 13:33.279
more screen time.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.159
And...

13:35.240 --> 13:37.759
- Bit opportunities.
- Big opportunities.

13:37.840 --> 13:40.000
Bit opportunities. Like comedic bits.
Like little riffs and stuff.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.440
- All right. - Practice that a bunch, man.
You gotta have that down.

13:42.519 --> 13:44.000
Because if you don't
fucking deliver the message,

13:44.080 --> 13:44.720
this whole thing's a waste, OK?

13:44.799 --> 13:46.320
- OK.
- Once you deliver the message,

13:46.399 --> 13:48.399
give it about five seconds.
Let it sink in.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.039
And then...
dealers choice.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.480
- Whatever you want, dog.
- When do I get that cash?

13:52.559 --> 13:54.720
You'll get half up front
and half when the deal's done.

13:54.799 --> 13:56.639
- How much did we agree to pay him?
- Twenty-thousand dollars.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.279
Twenty-thousand dollars?!

13:58.360 --> 13:59.360
- You're serious?
- What?

13:59.440 --> 14:01.200
You negotiated fucking
twenty-thousand dollars

14:01.279 --> 14:02.799
- for a basic Alabama beatdown?

14:02.879 --> 14:04.039
That's a fucking

14:04.120 --> 14:05.879
1-8-7 price, man.
What the fuck's wrong with you?

14:05.960 --> 14:07.399
I've never organized
a hit before.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.480
- I don't...
- This isn't a fucking hit.

14:08.559 --> 14:09.960
This isn't a fucking hit.
Don't say hit.

14:10.039 --> 14:11.320
If you're gonna negotiate
like a dipshit,

14:11.399 --> 14:12.279
you're gonna have to pay
the price.

14:12.360 --> 14:13.600
Look, I'll pay you 75 bucks

14:13.679 --> 14:14.919
and the difference is
coming out of your per diem.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.919
- Out of my per diem?!
- Yep. That's what we're doing.

14:38.679 --> 14:41.480
Oh! Look what the cat
dragged in.

14:41.559 --> 14:43.919
It doesn't
have to be this way.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.600
Well, this is
all your fault, man.

14:45.679 --> 14:48.600
You were hungry and
I took you under my wing.

14:48.679 --> 14:51.399
And then you bit the
underside of my fucking wing.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.919
There's room on the show
for both of us.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.360
A natural two-hander.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.960
Two-hander my dick!
I gave you everything, Kenny.

14:58.039 --> 14:59.799
And then you had
to challenge me.

14:59.879 --> 15:01.960
Now you're going down,
motherfucker.

15:02.039 --> 15:04.039
Hasn't enough blood
already been spilt?

15:04.120 --> 15:07.360
- When does it end?

15:07.440 --> 15:09.279
I'm gonna finish you,
once and for all.

15:09.360 --> 15:12.320
- You motherfucker.

15:12.399 --> 15:19.679
All right.
Let the best man win.

15:19.759 --> 15:21.919
chin doctor, and it just...

15:22.000 --> 15:24.519
He gave me these options.
It's such a difficult choice.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.840
The chin is one of the foremost things
you see on a person's face.

15:26.919 --> 15:28.360
OK. Here's an option.

15:28.440 --> 15:30.080
The John Kerry.
What do you think?

15:30.159 --> 15:31.399
- You don't like it.
- No.

15:31.480 --> 15:32.399
You don't like it all.

15:32.480 --> 15:33.840
I saw that by the look
on your face.

15:33.919 --> 15:35.519
- Now this is the Aaron Eckhart

15:35.600 --> 15:38.840
but it looks sort of more
like a butt chin, huh?

15:38.919 --> 15:39.840
What about this?

15:39.919 --> 15:45.879
- The John Travolta?
- Oh, someone's coming out.

15:45.960 --> 15:47.679
Joel, you are on.

15:47.759 --> 15:54.519
I'm gonna kill him.

15:54.600 --> 15:57.120
Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm not giving out
autographs today, man.

15:57.200 --> 16:00.080
Hello, Guy Young.
I am the fan of your show.

16:00.159 --> 16:04.600
Being said, give Kenny Powers
all the scream times

16:04.679 --> 16:06.559
- and big opportunities.
- Oh yeah.

16:06.639 --> 16:09.720
Kenny Pow... What the fuck are you
talking about, man?

16:09.799 --> 16:13.799
- What?

16:13.879 --> 16:15.759
- Oh. Oh.

16:15.840 --> 16:16.840
Look at me.
Look at me!

16:16.919 --> 16:19.679
- Look at me. - Oh no! Oh...

16:19.759 --> 16:22.720
Oh. Oh my God.

16:22.799 --> 16:28.639
He saw me!
He saw me!

16:28.720 --> 16:30.919
He's chasing us!

16:45.159 --> 16:47.600
- Kenny?

16:47.679 --> 16:53.279
Three, two, one...

16:53.360 --> 16:55.759
She's like,
"What the fuck is this?"

16:55.840 --> 16:57.240
No, but really,
what the fuck is this?

16:57.320 --> 16:59.960
is a celebration

17:00.039 --> 17:02.200
to remind you
how awesome your life is

17:02.279 --> 17:04.000
and how cool everything
is between you and I.

17:04.079 --> 17:05.599
- You invited all these people?
- Yeah.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.880
These are all your friends from the past.
Some from the future.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.400
They're new friends
that you'll meet tonight.

17:09.480 --> 17:12.440
Yeah. I put out a Facebook
invite e-chat thing.

17:12.519 --> 17:14.799
There's that person. There's them.
I forgot their names.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.240
Oh, and look
who else is here.

17:16.319 --> 17:18.599
- Jamie. Even though he moved to Orlando
- Oh. Jamie.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.519
I chartered a private
jet so he could be here.

17:20.599 --> 17:23.400
He said not to
say nothing so... sorry.

17:23.480 --> 17:26.440
- It's all right. - Thanks for keeping the secret,
James.

17:26.519 --> 17:28.359
Hey. There's one more
little surprise.

17:28.440 --> 17:31.880
Look who's back on the scene,
Mean Gene.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.359
The old spaghetti night crew,
reunited once again.

17:34.440 --> 17:36.279
Trying to rebuild their
foundation of marriage.

17:36.359 --> 17:38.480
Marriage is an important thing,

17:38.559 --> 17:40.240
- to work on, to keep at.
- Right.

17:40.319 --> 17:43.119
- You never quit a marriage.
Why is there a priest here?

17:43.200 --> 17:45.440
Because after we have the April flavored
cherry cheesecake,

17:45.519 --> 17:48.440
you and I... We're renewing
our vows, everyone.

17:48.519 --> 17:49.480
- That's right. Yep.

17:49.559 --> 17:51.759
In front of all these people.

17:51.839 --> 17:53.319
- It's gonna be the shit.
- Baby, um...

17:53.400 --> 17:55.920
This is...
This is too much right now.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.440
- This is great. Just enjoy yourself.

17:57.519 --> 17:59.079
Oh. You hear that?

17:59.160 --> 18:00.880
Sounds like another
mystery guest has arrived.

18:00.960 --> 18:03.079
Let me go get that.
Have fun. Enjoy yourself.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.680
Everybody, celebrate April.

18:04.759 --> 18:06.680
April's party.

18:06.759 --> 18:07.920
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- Kenny.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.559
Mission fail, dude.
OK, we gotta bow down.

18:10.640 --> 18:13.039
- There is no winning this one.
- What are you talking about?

18:13.119 --> 18:14.599
I'm talking about Joel. He blew it.

18:14.680 --> 18:16.039
We gave him
too much dialogue.

18:16.119 --> 18:18.480
OK. Guy Young
beat the shit out of him.

18:18.559 --> 18:20.160
You do realize the fucking
taping is tomorrow?

18:20.240 --> 18:21.680
- I know. I'm so sorry, Kenny.

18:21.759 --> 18:23.279
I am so sorry.
What should we do?

18:23.359 --> 18:25.079
What do you mean?
There's nothing we can do.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.880
Guy's gonna castrate me
on the show tomorrow.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.000
All because of you.

18:29.079 --> 18:30.519
Is there a big party
going on in here?

18:30.599 --> 18:32.480
Yes. I'm trying to
save my marriage.

18:32.559 --> 18:34.400
- Why wasn't I invited?
- Because, Stevie,

18:34.480 --> 18:35.599
you failed me.

18:35.680 --> 18:50.759
But... that just
happened right now...

18:50.839 --> 18:52.799
Everyone?
Everyone.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.160
Can I get your attention,
please.

18:54.240 --> 18:55.559
Everyone attentions, please.
Thank you.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.480
Viv, shut up.
OK? Shut up.

18:57.559 --> 19:00.319
Uhh, I just wanna thank you all once again
for coming out

19:00.400 --> 19:02.960
to this special night
to celebrate my wife,

19:03.039 --> 19:05.680
- April Powers.

19:05.759 --> 19:08.119
And right now, I want to do something that's a
little
out of character for me.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.400
Come on, baby doll. Come up here and let's
sing a duet together.

19:10.480 --> 19:11.920
I don't wanna sing.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.759
<i>Well, I've had the time</i>
<i>of my fucking life</i>

19:16.839 --> 19:18.319
You recognize this song,
sweetheart?

19:18.400 --> 19:22.680
- I don't wanna sing. - Come on, sweetheart.
This is your part.

19:22.759 --> 19:24.960
I know what you're doing.
It's so sweet.

19:25.039 --> 19:27.160
I don't really wanna sing.
Nope. You're part's almost up.

19:27.240 --> 19:30.000
Um. I don't wanna sing. I don't... I don't want
any of this.

19:30.079 --> 19:31.960
Kenny, it feels like
she doesn't want to sing.

19:32.039 --> 19:34.039
- So maybe we'll move on.
- OK, Dixie.

19:34.119 --> 19:35.839
Wonderful to have
your opinion in this thing.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.400
But she was talking to me
and so I heard what she said.

19:37.480 --> 19:38.680
OK. You know what? Fine.
This is April's party.

19:38.759 --> 19:41.559
Fuck it. She doesn't want to
fucking sing. Karaoke's done.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.519
There we are.
No more karaoke, everybody.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.240
- I never asked for this party. - Well, April, I'm
trying
to make things better.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.640
Kenny.
That's enough, Kenny.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.160
Motherfucker, you wanna say something.
Motherfucker. '

19:49.240 --> 19:50.880
You remember what
this does right here?

19:50.960 --> 19:52.119
You're gonna get that
outta my face.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.599
- Hey!

19:53.680 --> 19:56.640
Hey, that is enough. Leave him alone.
You're acting crazy.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.839
Oh, I'm acting crazy? Let's clear the air,
shall we?

19:58.920 --> 20:01.359
Can we clear the air for a moment?
Guess what, Dixie?

20:01.440 --> 20:02.880
Gene never cheated on you.
I lied about that

20:02.960 --> 20:05.519
because I didn't want April
to know I was doing cocaine.

20:05.599 --> 20:08.319
- True story. - That's true.
Thank you.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.400
I nev... I told you, I never slept with anybody.

20:10.480 --> 20:11.599
And then we got
fucking Tel over here.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.880
Goddamn Indian dude
pretending to be white.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.119
How much goddamn chicken
tikka masala do you eat?

20:16.200 --> 20:18.039
None. You're a disgrace, Tel.

20:18.119 --> 20:19.200
- That's enough. That's enough. - No. No, no. I'm
not done,
April.

20:19.279 --> 20:20.440
- That's enough.
- I'm not done.

20:20.519 --> 20:21.880
Because now I wanna turn
the spotlight onto you.

20:21.960 --> 20:25.000
What can I do to make you happy now?
Let's try and see.

20:25.079 --> 20:27.839
I can't invite your friends to a fucking party
'cause that's not enough.

20:27.920 --> 20:30.240
I can't sing a fucking song with you
'cause that's not enough.

20:30.319 --> 20:32.440
I can't buy fucking luxuries
and fancy cars

20:32.519 --> 20:34.960
and expensive fur coats
and fine jewelry and chinas!

20:35.039 --> 20:36.079
That's not enough either!

20:36.160 --> 20:38.200
None of it's fucking enough!

20:38.279 --> 20:39.799
What do you want?! Huh?

20:39.880 --> 20:42.039
You want me to quit
my fucking job?!

20:42.119 --> 20:43.799
Go back to being
your little bitch boy.

20:43.880 --> 20:45.640
Well, it's not happening!

20:45.720 --> 20:47.799
If anyone wants to take
my television job,

20:47.880 --> 20:56.440
they'll have to do it
over my dead fucking body!

20:56.519 --> 20:59.920
I think you need to leave.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.680
- No. I'm the one who...
- No! You need to get out.

21:02.759 --> 21:04.200
Get out.

21:04.279 --> 21:06.640
May... Let's maybe we could
just take it down a notch.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.359
- I'm done. I need you to go. - There's people
here
from out of town.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.160
Maybe everyone's saying some
stuff they don't really mean.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.119
No! I'm done.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.079
You don't mean this, April...

21:14.160 --> 21:16.039
I want you to get out!

21:16.119 --> 21:18.599
- Get the fuck out!
- Goddamn, woman.

21:18.680 --> 21:21.240
Throwing fucking
mustard at me.

21:21.319 --> 21:24.519
Oh! I can fucking
break shit too!

21:24.599 --> 21:26.200
I'm done.

21:26.279 --> 21:28.039
- Fine. You want me out of here?

21:28.119 --> 21:30.000
Party's over.

21:30.079 --> 21:33.319
I guess I'll have to find somebody new to fall in
love
with who will appreciate these.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.160
- Want some fucking rubies?
- Get the fuck out.

21:35.240 --> 21:38.079
Some fucking emeralds?

21:38.160 --> 21:39.519
Move. Get the fuck
out of the way.

21:39.599 --> 21:42.920
Worst goddamn
"fix my marriage party" ever.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.920
Dammit!

22:17.119 --> 22:19.920
- Goodbye, friend.

23:06.519 --> 23:10.240
It's not gonna be a problem.

23:10.319 --> 23:12.839
Oh, there he is.

23:12.920 --> 23:14.640
All right. I'll take care of it.
Don't worry about it.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.279
I got it. I got it, I got it.

23:16.359 --> 23:21.039
Oh, KP. I think I ran into
one of your fans yesterday.

23:21.119 --> 23:22.680
Or... my foot met his face.
Wha!

23:22.759 --> 23:25.160
- Look, man.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.880
I just wanna apologize.

23:26.960 --> 23:31.680
I know we're trapped in the midst of this

23:31.759 --> 23:35.720
I wanna extend my hand
in an offering of peace.

23:35.799 --> 23:37.680
My family life
is crumbling.

23:37.759 --> 23:42.079
My marriage is almost over. My... April kicked me
out of the house last night.

23:42.160 --> 23:44.160
I just don't think I have any more fight
left in me.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.160
You win, Guy.

23:46.240 --> 23:49.319
Please, just...
Tell the network to let me stay.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.160
We can do things
how they were before.

23:51.240 --> 23:52.839
You'll be in charge.
I'll know my place.

23:52.920 --> 23:57.119
And it can just be like
how it was before.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.680
I just can't lose
this job, Guy.

23:58.759 --> 24:00.799
This is all I have.
I'm hurting, man.

24:00.880 --> 24:04.440
I'm just trying to level
with you as a friend.

24:04.519 --> 24:06.359
Well...

24:06.440 --> 24:10.920
I'm not your friend.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.039
I never was, OK?
You're a fucking loser.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.000
OK? And you're not fit
to be out on that stage.

24:16.079 --> 24:19.279
You should be out there
with the... with the normies.

24:19.359 --> 24:20.519
With the plebeians.
You know?

24:20.599 --> 24:21.720
With the fucking
redneck idiots

24:21.799 --> 24:25.240
and the fucking
stupid jiggaboos.

24:25.319 --> 24:26.359
...'cause they
see bright lights.

24:26.440 --> 24:28.759
They want greatness
but they can't achieve it

24:28.839 --> 24:30.319
so they love
watching it.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.160
That's who I am. OK?

24:32.240 --> 24:36.920
I can shit in my hand and say, "Hey, taste
my shit... asshole."

24:37.000 --> 24:41.319
Those fucking morons
will eat that shit gladly.

24:41.400 --> 24:47.880
Chew it right up.
Remember this moment.

24:47.960 --> 24:50.960
I fucking win.
And, Kenny...

24:51.039 --> 24:53.079
You're fucking out.

24:53.160 --> 24:54.519
You're out.

24:54.599 --> 25:00.440
You're fired.
And good luck to you.

25:00.519 --> 25:03.319
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Guy Young in the house.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.319
- How's everybody doing tonight?

25:05.400 --> 25:08.160
You're an asshole, Guy Young.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.839
- No shit.

25:10.920 --> 25:16.519
Hot mic, champ.

25:16.599 --> 25:18.119
I'll be your jiggaboo.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.000
- Fuck you!

25:20.079 --> 25:23.039
Man, that's bullshit.

25:23.119 --> 25:26.599
I win.
