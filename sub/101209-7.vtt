-and you give it so freely, and...
-[chuckles]

25:06.922 --> 25:10.467
...I love the way you tug on your earlobe
when you read.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.552
-I had to buy a cream for it.
-[Ben] I know.

25:12.969 --> 25:14.971
[both giggling]

25:18.433 --> 25:19.309
Can I...

25:20.810 --> 25:22.020
[takes deep breath]

25:22.771 --> 25:24.481
Can I smell your hair?

25:25.732 --> 25:26.691
Sure.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.235
[Ben's breath trembles]

25:29.444 --> 25:31.863
-[Ben inhaling deeply]
-[Jill sighs] God, you're incredible.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.282
-You... You're incredible too.
-[both chuckle]

25:35.325 --> 25:36.826
Wanna do it? [sighs]

25:37.452 --> 25:39.621
-Do what?
-Have sex.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.915
The holy union of our multiple spirits.

25:41.998 --> 25:43.124
[Ben spluttering]

25:43.208 --> 25:44.876
-Sure, but, uh--
-But what?

25:45.085 --> 25:46.628
Uh, there's something
you need to know--

25:47.254 --> 25:48.547
-[grunts]
-Are you okay?

25:49.714 --> 25:50.590
Yeah.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.968
-Never been better.
-Good.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.095
-[Jill chuckles]
-Jill, you don't... [gasps]

25:55.178 --> 25:57.097
...you don't know the real me.

25:57.722 --> 25:58.682
Oh, yeah?

25:58.765 --> 26:00.976
-[whispers] Yeah.
-I know everything about you.

26:02.018 --> 26:05.313
I have pored myself over your teachings,
I have sung your Vedas,

26:05.397 --> 26:08.149
I have committed every part of your body

26:08.650 --> 26:10.944
-to my memory.
-But, Jill, that's not me.

26:11.278 --> 26:13.613
I'm somebody different. I'm...

26:14.698 --> 26:15.615
a virgin.

26:17.158 --> 26:18.868
-What about last week?
-Huh?

26:19.244 --> 26:20.412
You, me, and Keechie?

26:20.495 --> 26:21.538
In the sex swing.

26:21.830 --> 26:24.833
We practiced the suspended,
extended, four-part unification.

26:24.916 --> 26:27.836
-Klaus, you're so filthy!
-Yes, you are, Daddy.

26:27.919 --> 26:29.879
-Oh... Oh, hey... Oh!
-[Jill] Mmm...

26:29.963 --> 26:31.590
Wait, just... [moans]

26:31.673 --> 26:33.049
[Ben] Oh! Oh! Oh!

26:33.133 --> 26:35.176
-Okay!
-Hey, Daddy.

26:35.552 --> 26:36.386
You got a sec?

26:36.469 --> 26:37.470
Diego!

26:37.554 --> 26:38.513
Come on, we gotta go.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.974
-Yeah. I'll be right back.
-Okay.

26:41.057 --> 26:42.392
-I promise.
-Come on.

26:47.897 --> 26:49.524
[Handler chuckles]

26:50.066 --> 26:51.192
Hmm!

26:52.027 --> 26:53.528
-[AJ, muted] How dare you!
-Look at you.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.030
[AJ] I'll get you for this!

26:55.655 --> 26:57.532
-[shouting indistinctly]
-Back at work.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.951
And don't worry about that parking spot.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.704
It won't go to waste. [cackling]

27:02.787 --> 27:04.998
-[AJ] No! [splutters]
-Do I really have to be here?

27:05.415 --> 27:07.250
Oh, Lila, darling, no,
I need your opinion.

27:07.334 --> 27:09.502
These are all so good, I can't decide.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.671
What do you think of these
new security uniforms?

27:11.755 --> 27:13.173
Too pansy-ass?

27:13.965 --> 27:16.426
Hmm... I am a sucker for a beret, though.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.679
Oh, come on, this is my big day.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.890
Don't yuck my yum with your bad mood.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.559
And stop twisting
that tacky little bracelet

27:24.643 --> 27:26.227
like a sulky schoolgirl.

27:26.728 --> 27:29.147
We have achieved our dream.

27:29.230 --> 27:30.732
-Your dream.
-Hey.

27:33.943 --> 27:34.778
Here.

27:37.781 --> 27:40.241
-What is it?
-Well, it was meant to be a surprise,

27:40.325 --> 27:42.452
but your terrible attitude's ruined that.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.121
Head of security?

27:45.538 --> 27:48.291
You're always asking about more trust,
responsibility.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.542
Well, there it is.

27:49.626 --> 27:50.960
-Really?
-Really.

27:51.044 --> 27:53.588
-If you want it.
-[Lila scoffs softly]

27:57.342 --> 27:58.843
Yeah, I want it, but, um...

28:00.553 --> 28:01.846
I wanna do it my own way.

28:02.222 --> 28:04.891
Yeah, I wanna make my own decisions,
you know, pick my own team.

28:05.767 --> 28:06.726
Why not?

28:08.061 --> 28:08.937
You've earned it.

28:11.398 --> 28:13.274
-You need to come with me.
-Where?

28:14.067 --> 28:16.027
-[woman] Prophet. Prophet.
-Five found a way home.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.947
[giggles]
It's so great to talk to you again, Diego.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.408
-You hear what I just said?
-Yeah.

28:22.867 --> 28:25.662
-Are you high, Klaus?
-No, I'm not Klaus.

28:27.580 --> 28:28.456
I'm Ben.

28:30.041 --> 28:30.875
You are high.

28:30.959 --> 28:32.961
-Look, I don't have time for this.
-I can prove it.

28:33.628 --> 28:35.505
Ask me something only Ben would know.

28:37.298 --> 28:38.174
Okay.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.385
When we were little,

28:40.927 --> 28:43.388
what did you reprogram Allison's
Teddy Ruxpin to say?

28:45.140 --> 28:47.684
[in singsong]
"Luther sniffs Dad's underwear."

28:48.977 --> 28:50.145
[chuckles softly]

28:51.104 --> 28:52.147
Holy shit.

28:53.314 --> 28:54.774
[Ben laughs]

29:00.196 --> 29:01.489
[Diego] I don't get it, I mean...

29:01.573 --> 29:04.367
-Klaus said you didn't make it to Dallas.
-Well, Klaus says a lot of things,

29:04.451 --> 29:05.410
but guess what?

29:05.493 --> 29:06.786
I can possess him now

29:07.162 --> 29:08.621
and it's freakin' awesome.

29:08.955 --> 29:12.167
Okay, you can tell me all about it
on the way back to 2019. Okay?

29:12.250 --> 29:14.544
What about Destiny's Children?
We can't just leave them.

29:14.627 --> 29:16.254
Klaus should be the one to tell them--

29:16.337 --> 29:18.757
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, okay?
You stay in this body.

29:19.549 --> 29:21.968
We need someone responsible
behind the wheel, okay?

29:22.051 --> 29:25.054
All right, Diego. Will you wait?
I just need, like, ten minutes.

29:25.138 --> 29:26.055
-Ten minutes.
-Actually,

29:26.139 --> 29:28.349
-there's something I need to do first.
-[watch ticking]

29:28.475 --> 29:30.685
Meet me in the alley behind Elliott's
in 30 minutes, okay?

29:31.561 --> 29:33.062
-Do not be late.
-I won't.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.106
-I won't.
-Good to see you, brother.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.024
[Ben] You too.

29:36.608 --> 29:37.692
Bye. [grunts]

29:38.985 --> 29:41.863
-[clock ticking, echoing]
-Oh, no.

29:42.405 --> 29:43.281
[gasps]

30:03.551 --> 30:04.761
[both skidding on gravel]

30:06.930 --> 30:08.890
-[Vanya] What are you doing here?
-Looking for you.

30:08.973 --> 30:10.725
-We're going back to 2019.
-What are you talking about?

30:10.809 --> 30:13.895
Look, I don't really have time to explain
right now, but I found a way home.

30:14.270 --> 30:15.814
All right? We have 30 minutes to leave.

30:15.897 --> 30:17.816
What about my friends?
I can't just leave them here.

30:17.899 --> 30:19.943
Vanya, you don't have a choice in this,
all right?

30:20.026 --> 30:21.820
Doomsday will happen
if you don't come with me.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.321
Okay, then I'm bringing them with me.

30:23.404 --> 30:25.782
-They belong in this timeline.
-Says who?

30:26.241 --> 30:29.452
Sissy deserves a life where she doesn't
have to pretend to be someone she's not.

30:29.869 --> 30:30.995
And Harlan?

30:31.079 --> 30:33.581
There's a name for what he has.
We can get him the help he needs.

30:33.665 --> 30:34.541
Vanya.

30:34.624 --> 30:38.503
Look, a mom and her eight-year-old son
are not gonna screw up the timeline, Five!

30:38.837 --> 30:42.215
-They're insignificant.
-No one is insignificant.

30:43.508 --> 30:46.135
I'm sorry, all right?
But we can't take that risk.

30:46.761 --> 30:48.054
They have to stay.

30:49.722 --> 30:50.765
Come on.

30:51.933 --> 30:52.934
Why do you get to decide?

30:53.017 --> 30:55.436
You're the reason we're stuck here
in the first place.

30:57.897 --> 31:01.150
If I did nothing, we would all be dead
right now, thanks to you.

31:04.571 --> 31:05.655
They're coming with me.

31:05.738 --> 31:06.823
[scoffs softly]

31:07.866 --> 31:10.493
Vanya, do not test me right now.

31:11.870 --> 31:12.704
That's funny.

31:13.454 --> 31:15.790
'Cause I was just about to say
the same thing.

31:17.333 --> 31:22.297
[high-pitched tone resonating softly]

31:23.464 --> 31:27.135
[Five's power whooshing rhythmically]

31:32.640 --> 31:33.892
[both powering down]

31:34.559 --> 31:35.393
Fine.

31:35.935 --> 31:37.687
-"Fine," what?
-I'll be there,

31:37.770 --> 31:40.398
-but I need to say goodbye first.
-Oh, Vanya, we don't have the time.

31:40.481 --> 31:42.442
Well, it's either that or I'm not coming.

31:43.443 --> 31:44.319
[scoffs]

31:46.613 --> 31:47.614
[Five] The alley.

31:48.656 --> 31:49.782
Don't be late. [sighs]

31:52.076 --> 31:54.162
-[muttering]
-[Vanya's car starts]

31:54.245 --> 31:56.998
[clock ticking, echoing]

32:02.086 --> 32:03.087
Oh, good.

32:03.504 --> 32:05.048
It's you and your stupid face.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.551
[Lila] Weird time to garden.

32:09.218 --> 32:12.138
-Can we talk? The truth this time.
-[Diego] Oh, I know the truth.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.849
You used me, Lila. You're a liar.

32:14.933 --> 32:18.519
-Oh, come on. What did I really lie about?
-[Diego] Who you are,

32:18.603 --> 32:21.606
who you work for, why you're here,
what you want from us. That's all.

32:21.689 --> 32:23.274
Yeah, but the rest was true.

32:25.234 --> 32:28.279
Everyone lies, Diego, and...
and I was only lying to protect you.

32:30.365 --> 32:31.240
Mostly.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.369
Do you know how hard it is to trust people

32:35.078 --> 32:37.538
when your whole childhood
was bullshit manipulation?

32:39.248 --> 32:40.124
[Lila] Uh-huh.

32:40.708 --> 32:42.377
Then why would you do that to me?

32:47.757 --> 32:48.800
Tell you what,

32:49.467 --> 32:50.885
I'm gonna finish this hole...

32:50.969 --> 32:53.012
[grunts] ...save the world,

32:53.429 --> 32:55.348
and forget we ever met. [grunts]

32:55.431 --> 32:58.601
[soft piano melody playing]

33:01.729 --> 33:02.939
Wait, is that...

33:03.773 --> 33:05.316
is that dentist-chair guy?

33:05.400 --> 33:06.526
Elliott.

33:06.943 --> 33:09.654
-Your Swedish buddies got him.
-Oh, shit.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.700
I liked that shit-muppet.

33:19.622 --> 33:22.959
Well, here's to Elliott, I guess.

33:24.168 --> 33:25.253
Um...

33:26.754 --> 33:28.548
I'll miss his crazy theories...

33:29.382 --> 33:31.384
[Diego continues digging]

33:32.385 --> 33:34.303
...and I'll miss sharing his bed with you.

33:54.949 --> 33:56.701
-[flask clinks]
-We done now?

33:59.454 --> 34:01.748
[piano music slows, goes off-key]

34:02.206 --> 34:03.041
[Diego] Oh...

34:04.000 --> 34:05.626
[distorted] ...balls.

34:09.380 --> 34:10.465
Yup.

34:10.548 --> 34:12.550
[clock ticking, echoing]

34:18.181 --> 34:19.682
[Ray] How much time do we have?

34:19.766 --> 34:21.267
[Ray's breath trembling]

34:21.893 --> 34:23.144
[Allison sniffles softly]

34:23.519 --> 34:24.437
Twenty-three minutes.

34:24.520 --> 34:25.813
Twenty-three minutes?

34:26.272 --> 34:27.732
There has to be another way.

34:28.191 --> 34:29.358
Look, I... [sniffling]

34:30.359 --> 34:33.362
...I know it's crazy, but if I asked,
would you come with me?

34:34.697 --> 34:36.115
You want me to leave Dallas?

34:41.996 --> 34:43.790
You want me to leave the movement?

34:46.167 --> 34:47.710
The movement's not finished.

34:48.127 --> 34:49.837
Not even in 2019.

34:49.921 --> 34:51.839
Yeah, but you said that
the work we're doing here,

34:51.923 --> 34:53.591
-it has an impact.
-No, it does.

34:53.966 --> 34:54.884
It does.

34:58.679 --> 35:00.473
Well, babe, I just can't leave it behind.

35:02.433 --> 35:04.185
My part of the fight is right here.

35:05.353 --> 35:06.395
[Allison sniffles]

35:07.146 --> 35:08.189
[sobs softly]

35:10.024 --> 35:10.983
[sniffles]

35:11.526 --> 35:12.777
I can rumor you.

35:14.737 --> 35:16.072
-Take the pain away.
-No.

35:17.156 --> 35:18.658
We're not gonna do it like that.

35:20.701 --> 35:21.953
I don't wanna forget you.

35:23.579 --> 35:24.789
I don't wanna forget us.

35:27.834 --> 35:31.003
I would take my year with you
over a lifetime with anybody else.

35:32.880 --> 35:33.798
You hear me?

35:35.967 --> 35:37.802
I'm still the luckiest man I know.

35:38.302 --> 35:39.345
[chuckles]

35:41.055 --> 35:42.181
[Allison whimpers]

35:45.852 --> 35:47.353
[knocking at door]

36:00.616 --> 36:02.827
I'm sorry, now is not a good time.

36:03.286 --> 36:05.830
[gasps, choking]

36:08.791 --> 36:11.127
-What's going on?
-[panting] This is it. We're leaving.

36:11.836 --> 36:12.712
[Sissy] Well...

36:13.379 --> 36:15.339
-where are we going?
-To a better place, okay?

36:15.423 --> 36:17.049
I promise I'll explain when we get there.

36:17.133 --> 36:18.009
-What about Carl?
-No.

36:18.092 --> 36:19.802
We need to leave before Carl gets back.

36:19.886 --> 36:21.888
-I need to talk to him first.
-There isn't time.

36:21.971 --> 36:23.931
-He's my husband. I owe an explanation.
-You don't owe him!

36:24.015 --> 36:26.726
-I need to leave him a note.
-He knows about us, Sissy!

36:27.560 --> 36:29.812
He threatened to send Harlan away
to an institution.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.564
We need to go,
