00:00.260 --> 00:02.428
<i>Previously on Bates Motel... </i>

00:02.529 --> 00:04.094
Norman, can I tell you something

00:04.196 --> 00:06.632
- that I've never told anybody?
- Yeah. What?

00:06.733 --> 00:09.535
My brother used to make
me have sex with him.

00:09.636 --> 00:12.216
And it went on until he moved out.

00:12.247 --> 00:13.539
I'm so sorry, mother.

00:13.640 --> 00:16.074
I'm looking for a place called Bates Motel.

00:16.175 --> 00:18.209
- I'm looking for my sister.
- Who's your sister?

00:18.311 --> 00:19.544
Norma Bates.

00:19.645 --> 00:21.346
[gunshot]

00:21.447 --> 00:22.747
I need to know that what
you're doing makes sense.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.582
I killed the guy that killed my dad.

00:24.683 --> 00:26.217
Dylan I need you to listen to me.

00:26.319 --> 00:27.518
I lied to you. I do know
what happened to Bradley.

00:27.619 --> 00:29.154
- She's hiding in our basement.
- What?

00:29.255 --> 00:30.721
She's ready to be driven to Cold Creek

00:30.823 --> 00:32.390
to get on a bus that leaves in two hours.

00:32.491 --> 00:33.758
It'll take her to Boston where she's gonna

00:33.859 --> 00:35.259
start her life over.

00:35.360 --> 00:36.327
She's on the bus.

00:36.428 --> 00:38.629
Thank you.

00:38.730 --> 00:40.932
This is for you.

01:08.826 --> 01:10.426
Hi.

01:10.528 --> 01:12.362
Want some cereal?

01:12.463 --> 01:13.797
No.

01:13.898 --> 01:16.900
Have you seen the paper today?

01:24.735 --> 01:27.210
They, um...

01:27.311 --> 01:29.078
They found some of Bradley's clothes

01:29.179 --> 01:32.848
and a suicide note near
the rocks on Gilmer Beach.

01:32.949 --> 01:37.086
I'm so sorry, Norman. This is awful.

01:37.187 --> 01:39.655
Thanks. Um...

01:39.756 --> 01:41.189
It's okay.

01:41.290 --> 01:43.726
I'm okay.

01:43.827 --> 01:45.561
Are you?

01:45.662 --> 01:47.329
Because I don't think I am.

01:47.430 --> 01:49.627
I mean, I felt bad before,

01:49.677 --> 01:53.168
But when I saw this, I...

01:53.269 --> 01:55.671
I can't believe how bad I feel now.

01:55.772 --> 01:58.606
Why? It's not like you
guys were actually friends.

01:58.707 --> 02:00.375
I know.

02:00.476 --> 02:02.077
That's why I was so worried about you.

02:02.178 --> 02:04.079
I mean, if I feel like this,

02:04.180 --> 02:07.182
I can't imagine how it must be for you.

02:13.789 --> 02:16.691
Well, I better get down to the office.

02:16.792 --> 02:21.796
But if you want to talk,
then you know where I am.

02:22.831 --> 02:25.600
So sorry, Norman.

02:25.701 --> 02:28.436
Me too.

02:30.272 --> 02:32.273
Don't...

02:33.575 --> 02:35.176
Yeah, you can leave it.

02:35.277 --> 02:37.344
Sure. Okay.

02:37.446 --> 02:40.448
See you later.

02:59.567 --> 03:01.668
Norma Bates. I was gonna call you.

03:01.769 --> 03:04.070
- I am so sorry.
- About what?

03:04.171 --> 03:05.605
That these jerk-offs wouldn't let me

03:05.706 --> 03:07.173
give you the lead,

03:07.274 --> 03:09.442
which you seriously should've gotten.

03:09.543 --> 03:11.711
[sighs] Don't worry about it.

03:11.812 --> 03:14.280
Not only am I worried about it, I quit.

03:14.381 --> 03:17.450
They can direct their own stupid
lame-ass community musical.

03:17.551 --> 03:20.319
- You don't need to quit.
- Oh, no, I do, actually,

03:20.420 --> 03:23.823
because apparently casting
is up to Jocelyn Kirby

03:23.924 --> 03:26.391
and Jocelyn wants her friend Libby Porter

03:26.493 --> 03:28.560
to have the part instead of
you because she's an idiot.

03:28.662 --> 03:31.697
So... anyway, so I quit.

03:31.798 --> 03:33.833
I'm sorry that you had to quit.

03:33.934 --> 03:35.534
Oh, don't be.

03:35.635 --> 03:37.269
If it wasn't this, it'd be something else.

03:37.370 --> 03:38.604
I have better things to do with my time,

03:38.704 --> 03:42.307
like stick red-hot needles in my eyes.

03:42.408 --> 03:45.577
Well, I'm sorry about the part.

03:45.678 --> 03:48.380
You deserved it.

03:48.481 --> 03:50.081
Hey, can I at least buy you a drink?

03:50.183 --> 03:51.617
That would be so nice,

03:51.717 --> 03:54.352
but it's... it's not
even 11:00 in the morning.

03:54.453 --> 03:56.121
Oh, good. That means the bars are open.

03:56.221 --> 03:58.556
Okay. [chuckles]

03:58.658 --> 04:01.693
So, Norma, how do you like it here so far?

04:01.794 --> 04:05.296
Uh, well, parts of it
have been really good.

04:05.397 --> 04:06.698
Thank you.

04:06.799 --> 04:08.566
The motel's going gangbusters right now.

04:08.667 --> 04:10.134
Mm.

04:10.235 --> 04:12.069
But there's...

04:12.171 --> 04:15.373
It's been weird.

04:15.474 --> 04:20.043
There was thing that happened
shortly after we moved in.

04:20.144 --> 04:24.782
Oh. That deputy who got shot up?

04:26.851 --> 04:30.353
What a terrible thing to go through.

04:30.454 --> 04:33.791
Yeah, it was.

04:33.892 --> 04:37.728
And I just feel that...

04:37.829 --> 04:39.396
that some people here think

04:39.497 --> 04:43.567
that what Shelby did as
a business, how he died,

04:43.668 --> 04:45.468
even though I had nothing to do with it,

04:45.570 --> 04:47.470
that somehow, it reflects on me.

04:47.572 --> 04:50.674
Mm-hmm, yeah. Some of them think that.

04:50.774 --> 04:54.711
But they're just idiots
with nothing better to do,

04:54.812 --> 04:57.314
not anyone you'd want
to spend any time with.

04:57.415 --> 04:59.782
I think you went through
something terrible,

04:59.883 --> 05:03.820
and you handled it with incredible bravery.

05:05.422 --> 05:07.156
Just promise me one thing...

05:07.257 --> 05:08.791
You won't give a rat's ass

05:08.892 --> 05:10.793
what some people think or say.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.495
Okay?

05:13.597 --> 05:15.097
Okay.

05:15.198 --> 05:18.100
Okay, I'll try.

05:18.201 --> 05:20.168
You're one of the most interesting people

05:20.270 --> 05:21.570
I've met in this town,

05:21.671 --> 05:24.473
and I cannot wait to introduce you around.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.280
Hey.

05:32.381 --> 05:34.582
Where do you want the viburnum?

05:35.501 --> 05:36.882
She didn't say.

05:36.919 --> 05:39.387
Just put it wherever it's not gonna die.

05:57.473 --> 06:00.174
Hey, I'm looking for Norma Bates.

06:02.895 --> 06:05.379
- Okay.
- Is she around?

06:06.359 --> 06:09.683
- No.
- Is she coming back soon?

06:10.585 --> 06:13.252
- Why?
- Well, I'll come back later.

06:13.353 --> 06:15.188
Maybe she'll be here then.

06:15.289 --> 06:17.189
Yeah, and I'll still be here too.

06:19.499 --> 06:21.036
So why don't you just say what you want?

06:24.030 --> 06:25.772
What's the deal here? You her son?

06:28.569 --> 06:29.835
Who are you?

06:32.206 --> 06:33.513
I'm her brother.

06:37.089 --> 06:38.611
Norma doesn't have a brother.

06:38.712 --> 06:40.613
Are you sure about that?

06:40.714 --> 06:42.081
No.

06:42.181 --> 06:43.482
She never talked about me to you.

06:43.583 --> 06:44.950
Never even mentioned she had a brother.

06:45.051 --> 06:48.381
[scoffs] Some things never change.

07:11.076 --> 07:13.544
Norma, man, it's been so long.

07:16.048 --> 07:17.849
I thought about this moment so many times,

07:17.950 --> 07:20.584
but now that I'm actually looking at you...

07:20.686 --> 07:22.486
You cannot be here.

07:22.587 --> 07:24.388
No, no, Norma, don't say that.

07:24.489 --> 07:27.391
- You have to leave.
- What's going on?

07:27.492 --> 07:28.925
Five minutes, just... just five minutes.

07:30.328 --> 07:33.063
Look, please, Norma, I understand.

07:33.165 --> 07:36.200
Don't make me go. Not yet, please?

07:38.170 --> 07:39.970
[screams] Get out!

07:45.276 --> 07:48.478
What was that?

07:48.579 --> 07:51.148
Don't ever let him back in here.

07:53.117 --> 07:55.952
Ever.

08:22.913 --> 08:24.980
Mother.

08:25.082 --> 08:27.116
Mother, do we know what the
deal is with that play yet?

08:27.217 --> 08:28.918
This just isn't picking anything up at all.

08:29.019 --> 08:30.485
I think it's broken.

08:30.587 --> 08:33.222
- What?
- The play.

08:33.323 --> 08:36.857
You know, like when
rehearsals start or whatever.

08:36.958 --> 08:38.427
We're not doing it.

08:38.528 --> 08:40.395
We're not?

08:40.496 --> 08:42.231
Did we not get parts?

08:42.332 --> 08:43.599
I did not get one, no.

08:43.700 --> 08:45.100
You did. You're in the chorus.

08:45.201 --> 08:46.835
- You want to be in the chorus?
- No.

08:46.936 --> 08:48.203
I didn't even want to do
it in the first place, so...

08:48.304 --> 08:52.006
No, you didn't. And you were right.

08:52.108 --> 08:55.443
Theater's stupid, so we're not doing it.

[vacuum humming]

[shuts off vacuum]

09:05.287 --> 09:06.725
Mother, what's wrong?

09:10.659 --> 09:14.428
My brother Caleb was here.

09:14.529 --> 09:15.996
What?

09:16.097 --> 09:17.798
Just out of nowhere, he just showed up.

09:17.899 --> 09:18.966
What did he want?

09:19.067 --> 09:20.167
I don't care. I threw him out.

09:20.269 --> 09:21.435
Well, how did he find us?

09:21.536 --> 09:23.203
You can find anyone these days.

09:23.304 --> 09:25.572
I don't know how. Everyone else seems to.

09:25.673 --> 09:26.573
[sighs]

09:26.674 --> 09:29.676
[vacuum hums]

09:35.349 --> 09:37.550
I shouldn't have told you.

09:37.652 --> 09:39.419
It's nothing. It's not important.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.710
He's gone, so forget about it.

09:43.123 --> 09:45.151
I'm fine.

09:48.504 --> 09:51.298
Norman, I'm trying to vacuum!

09:56.603 --> 09:58.171
Zane's crazy.

09:58.272 --> 10:01.440
He's gonna be a disaster.
We're all gonna wind up dead.

10:01.541 --> 10:02.869
Will you shut up?

10:07.214 --> 10:09.715
[crows caw]

[guns click]

10:43.182 --> 10:45.483
[flies buzzing]

10:52.324 --> 10:54.559
At least now we know what they're gonna do

10:54.660 --> 10:57.428
about Zane killing Johnny.

10:59.130 --> 11:02.466
[overlapping chatter]

11:08.473 --> 11:10.174
Hey.

11:10.275 --> 11:13.344
How'd the hair dye turn out?

11:13.444 --> 11:16.046
Fine.

11:16.147 --> 11:19.215
How'd that work? Your mom's a blonde.

11:19.316 --> 11:21.217
Well, yeah, I just accidentally

11:21.318 --> 11:23.487
got the wrong color. [chuckles]

11:23.588 --> 11:25.188
So what about you?

11:25.289 --> 11:26.857
Are you ready to sing your little heart out

11:26.957 --> 11:28.558
in the chorus or what?

11:28.659 --> 11:31.428
I actually came here to tell
someone I'm dropping out.

11:31.529 --> 11:34.531
How come you're quitting, quitter?

11:34.632 --> 11:37.367
I'm just not that into it. That's all.

11:37.467 --> 11:38.902
Because your mom didn't get a part?

11:39.003 --> 11:40.503
She totally should have.
She was really good.

11:40.604 --> 11:42.405
But you don't want to do it without her?

11:42.506 --> 11:45.041
- Is that it?
- I... no, I didn't want

11:45.142 --> 11:46.943
to do it in the first place, so...

11:47.044 --> 11:49.379
Yeah, you didn't. Musicals are ass.

11:49.479 --> 11:52.047
Tech is fun as shit, though.
It's all painting and lifting.

11:52.148 --> 11:54.216
It's practical. You get ripped.

11:54.317 --> 11:56.619
Plus everyone gets drunk backstage.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.153
You should do tech.

11:58.254 --> 12:00.088
Why?

12:00.189 --> 12:01.857
I just said why.

12:01.958 --> 12:04.427
But also, it's summer,
and it's White Pine Bay.

12:04.528 --> 12:08.397
So what else are you gonna do? [chuckles]

12:17.073 --> 12:19.874
You're still here, huh?

12:19.976 --> 12:23.545
Yeah, non-refundable
ticket. Fly out Tuesday.

12:23.646 --> 12:25.346
So I'll hang out here a few days,

12:25.448 --> 12:28.450
see the Oregon sights before I fly home.

12:30.385 --> 12:33.354
I'm sorry to put you in
the middle of all that.

12:33.456 --> 12:35.022
No, it's cool.

12:35.123 --> 12:36.524
No, I should've known
that was gonna happen.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.125
It's Norma... You know?

12:38.226 --> 12:41.429
But I'm an optimist at heart.

12:41.529 --> 12:44.498
Anyway, it was good meeting you.

12:44.599 --> 12:47.047
Why is she so mad you anyways?

12:51.673 --> 12:53.307
Ah, you know how families are.

12:53.408 --> 12:56.010
Things that happen years and years ago,

12:56.111 --> 12:57.878
it's like they're yesterday.

12:57.979 --> 13:00.881
You don't need to be
loaded down with all that.

13:00.982 --> 13:02.983
Yeah.

13:04.552 --> 13:06.553
So what are you gonna do till Tuesday?

13:06.654 --> 13:08.154
Thought maybe I'd go fishing.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.524
There's great fly-fishing here in Oregon.

13:10.625 --> 13:12.459
Your granddad talked about fishing

13:12.560 --> 13:15.295
the Williamson river and the Umpqua.

13:15.396 --> 13:17.998
He used to tie his own flies.

13:18.099 --> 13:21.401
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:21.502 --> 13:23.836
I always kind of wondered how you do that.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.505
Yeah, I never got the hang of it,

13:25.606 --> 13:28.074
but I still got a boxful of his.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.110
I brought 'em with me.

13:30.211 --> 13:33.312
We could maybe go find a river to stand in.

13:36.617 --> 13:38.851
I'm... I'm kind of busy today.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.620
Hey, no worries.

26:13.005 --> 26:16.875

26:18.711 --> 26:23.514
She told me some things. Not a lot.

26:23.615 --> 26:25.317
And the stuff she did tell me,

26:25.418 --> 26:28.519
well, I'm never sure what was true.

26:28.620 --> 26:31.889
You know, the Norma Louise
I remember would get close,

26:31.991 --> 26:34.725
and then she'd get closer,
and then you'd be as close

26:34.827 --> 26:36.761
as two people could possibly be...

26:36.862 --> 26:39.564
Then suddenly you'd be out.

26:42.568 --> 26:44.602
So what have you been doing all this time?

26:44.703 --> 26:45.636
Where do you live?

26:45.737 --> 26:47.004
Costa Rica.

26:47.105 --> 26:49.006
- In Costa Rica?
- [laughs] Yeah.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.475
I have these friends, a married couple,

26:50.576 --> 26:52.643
and they own this funky hotel resort

26:52.744 --> 26:54.578
on this fantastic piece of property.

26:54.679 --> 26:55.612
You been down there?

26:55.713 --> 26:57.348
- To Costa Rica?
- Yeah.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.716
No, but I hear it's amazing though.

26:59.817 --> 27:02.353
But so my friends, they're
getting a divorce...

27:02.454 --> 27:03.653
Amicable, you know.

27:03.754 --> 27:05.622
But they need to cash out to split up.

27:05.723 --> 27:07.924
So they'll sell, which
they really want to do,

27:08.026 --> 27:09.826
and if I get the money together,

27:09.927 --> 27:11.495
they'll sell it to me

27:11.596 --> 27:15.999
for about 60% of what it's actually worth.

27:16.100 --> 27:18.267
- That's a good opportunity.
- Right?

27:18.369 --> 27:21.037
Plus they want to sell it to
someone they know, you know,

27:21.138 --> 27:23.907
Who can run it in the
same spirit that they did.

27:24.008 --> 27:26.942
- That sounds awesome.
- Yeah.

27:27.044 --> 27:28.777
When they offered, I thought

27:28.879 --> 27:31.481
it was a gift from God out of nowhere,

27:31.581 --> 27:34.617
Something Norma could be a part of too...

27:34.718 --> 27:37.853
You know, a reward I could bring
her for what we went through.

27:37.954 --> 27:39.788
You know, I thought enough time had gone by

27:39.890 --> 27:41.757
that she could finally hear me.

27:44.327 --> 27:46.562
What do you mean? What did you go through?

27:46.663 --> 27:48.664
I kept waiting to grow
up, get bigger than him,

27:48.765 --> 27:51.600
but it just never happened.

27:51.701 --> 27:53.736
You know, I mean, for all I knew,

27:53.837 --> 27:56.338
every family was like ours anyway.

27:56.439 --> 27:58.674
But I'm a man now, so I get it,

27:58.775 --> 28:02.411
you know, how worthless he must've felt.

28:02.512 --> 28:05.580
But I wasn't a man then,
and Norma sure wasn't.

28:05.681 --> 28:09.317
And he just took it out on us.

28:09.419 --> 28:11.286

28:11.387 --> 28:13.888
Such a pretty little kid.

28:13.989 --> 28:15.790
Such a trusting girl,

28:15.891 --> 28:17.458
and I couldn't protect her.

28:17.560 --> 28:19.994
I mean, she wants to forget
it happened, forget me,

28:20.095 --> 28:21.796
and I get that. She wants to blame me.

28:21.897 --> 28:24.966
I mean, I blame me too. I always have.

28:25.067 --> 28:27.835
Then I heard she was in
the hotel business now.

28:27.937 --> 28:29.503
I don't know. It just...

28:29.605 --> 28:31.305
[pouring beer] It seemed like fate.

29:42.484 --> 29:44.318
Oh.

29:44.419 --> 29:48.289
She didn't actually send me
out here to check up on you.

29:48.390 --> 29:50.191
Well, she did, but she also told me

29:50.292 --> 29:52.059
to be thoughtful and charming

29:52.160 --> 29:54.295
and to not talk about my
divorce, so there's that.

37:41.833 --> 37:43.234
Well, I just thought you were.

37:43.335 --> 37:44.569
And then we just saw you there,

37:44.670 --> 37:46.337
and Philip thought you were cute, so...

37:46.438 --> 37:48.138
Well, I'm sorry, well, for him.

37:48.240 --> 37:49.973
But, uh, no.

37:50.075 --> 37:51.274
No, I'm... I'm not gay.

37:51.375 --> 37:54.144
Okay, fine. Poor Philip.

37:54.245 --> 37:56.513
And honestly, maybe you
should get out more then

37:56.614 --> 37:58.982
'cause your whole thing
is really confusing.

37:59.084 --> 38:00.751
You make out with gay guys for no reason.

38:00.852 --> 38:02.485
That's pretty confusing too.

38:02.587 --> 38:05.155
There's always a reason
to make out, Norman.

38:05.256 --> 38:07.390
You don't have to take
everything so seriously.

38:07.491 --> 38:10.694
I don't have to. I want to.

38:15.392 --> 38:17.978
- Is this where you live?
- Yeah.

38:20.037 --> 38:22.606
Your parents home?

38:22.707 --> 38:24.406
My dad is.

38:24.507 --> 38:27.476
It's just him.

38:27.577 --> 38:30.947
I left my window open.
I can get in that way.

38:31.048 --> 38:33.149
Oh, were you not supposed to go out?

38:33.250 --> 38:36.418
No, I can go out.

38:36.519 --> 38:38.287
I'll see you tomorrow at tech, right?

38:38.388 --> 38:40.188
Uh-huh.

38:40.290 --> 38:42.591
I heard we have to paint
60 happy little trees.

38:42.692 --> 38:45.794
[laughs]

38:55.538 --> 38:58.306
[clattering]

39:18.360 --> 39:21.262
Mom...

39:23.666 --> 39:27.234
He's a nice guy.

39:27.736 --> 39:30.003
Who is?

39:30.104 --> 39:32.138
Your brother.

39:34.275 --> 39:37.944
He's still in town. He's over at King's.

39:43.117 --> 39:47.187
He told me what happened,

39:47.287 --> 39:49.823
what you went through,

39:49.924 --> 39:54.194
what your dad did to you guys.

39:54.294 --> 39:56.596
He said he didn't do
anything to try and stop it,

39:56.697 --> 40:00.633
to protect you.

40:00.735 --> 40:04.704
He says you're right to blame him, but...

40:04.804 --> 40:06.772
He'd do anything to make things better.

40:06.873 --> 40:10.209
Would he? Would he really?

40:10.310 --> 40:12.811
I don't know how you survived it.

40:12.912 --> 40:14.714
I knew you were strong,

40:14.814 --> 40:19.084
but it must've been so hard.

40:19.185 --> 40:20.652
You must've been so angry.

40:20.754 --> 40:23.922
You must be so angry.

40:24.023 --> 40:26.658
But he's your brother. He's your family.

40:26.760 --> 40:32.164
I kn exactly who he is and what he is.

40:35.968 --> 40:39.904
He raped me, Dylan.

40:40.005 --> 40:41.139
He raped me

40:41.240 --> 40:46.645
over and over every day for years.

40:48.648 --> 40:51.249
You're unbelievable Norma, you know that?

40:53.752 --> 40:55.619
I never met this man before yesterday,

40:55.720 --> 40:57.621
never even knew that I had an Uncle.

40:57.722 --> 41:00.424
But already he's been nicer
to me than you've ever been,

41:00.525 --> 41:01.926
told me more than you ever have.

41:02.027 --> 41:03.594
He raped me, Dylan!

41:03.695 --> 41:05.629
- I don't believe you!
- Get out of my house!

41:05.730 --> 41:07.799
You'd say anything to get your own way.

41:07.900 --> 41:09.032
My own way?

41:09.133 --> 41:10.634
I have never gotten my own way, ever,

41:10.735 --> 41:12.469
and that includes being your damn mother!

41:12.570 --> 41:14.405
You don't like him, and
you don't want me to!

41:14.506 --> 41:15.773
He didn't rape you!

41:15.873 --> 41:17.474
You weren't there! You don't know!

41:17.575 --> 41:19.142
I don't need to be. I've lived with you.

41:19.243 --> 41:21.612
I know what you're made of,
what you do to get your way!

41:21.713 --> 41:23.380
He raped me, and I had
no one to protect me!

41:23.481 --> 41:25.849
You're a liar!

41:25.950 --> 41:27.184
Get away from her!

41:39.530 --> 41:42.064
Norman, it's not his
fault! He can't help it!

41:42.165 --> 41:44.634
It is his fault! I'm not
gonna let him hurt you!

41:44.735 --> 41:46.135
She's lying! Can't you see?

41:46.236 --> 41:48.170
Norman, stop it! Stop it!

41:48.271 --> 41:51.273
He can't help it! It's his dad!

41:54.745 --> 41:57.413
[sniffles]

41:57.514 --> 42:00.515
Caleb is his dad.

42:00.616 --> 42:03.452
[crying]

42:03.553 --> 42:06.688
I'm sorry.
