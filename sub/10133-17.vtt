16:34.869 --> 16:36.663
right when

16:34.869 --> 16:36.663
Kevin and I were..

16:39.039 --> 16:40.374
Never mind.

16:43.210 --> 16:46.046
Deej, whatever you say

16:43.210 --> 16:46.046
is just between you and me.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.299
You know that, don't ya?

16:49.843 --> 16:50.969
Yeah.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.096
So what happened?

16:55.306 --> 16:57.224
Oh, Becky..

16:57.266 --> 16:59.477
Now, we were playing

16:57.266 --> 16:59.477
"Spin the Bottle"

16:59.519 --> 17:02.730
and they set it up so Kevin

16:59.519 --> 17:02.730
and I were gonna kiss.

17:02.772 --> 17:06.233
And I really like him

17:02.772 --> 17:06.233
and I kinda wanted to.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.319
But I didn't want to,

17:06.275 --> 17:08.319
you know?

17:09.278 --> 17:11.322
'Cause everybody was watching

17:11.364 --> 17:13.700
and I've never kissed

17:11.364 --> 17:13.700
anyone before.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.577
D.J., you should

17:14.951 --> 17:16.577
never do something

17:16.619 --> 17:18.538
just because people

17:16.619 --> 17:18.538
want you to do it.

17:20.790 --> 17:24.669
A kiss is a very special,

17:20.790 --> 17:24.669
very personal thing.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.588
Especially your

17:25.670 --> 17:27.588
first kiss.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.008
I was a little scared.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.760
Everybody's scared

17:30.049 --> 17:32.760
about their first kiss.

17:33.344 --> 17:34.846
Kimmy wasn't.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.097
Never go by Kimmy.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.144
But I was scared

17:40.142 --> 17:42.144
about my first kiss.

17:44.313 --> 17:47.066
It was at a school picnic.

17:47.107 --> 17:50.904
Jimmy Stone and I had just won

17:47.107 --> 17:50.904
the three-legged race.

17:50.945 --> 17:53.489
And then we went for a walk

17:50.945 --> 17:53.489
down by the pond.

17:53.531 --> 17:55.992
Which wasn't easy, because

17:53.531 --> 17:55.992
we were still tied together.

17:57.911 --> 18:01.497
And we both went to untie

17:57.911 --> 18:01.497
the knot, and we bumped heads.

18:01.539 --> 18:04.208
And we started laughing so hard

18:01.539 --> 18:04.208
that we fell over.

18:05.877 --> 18:07.086
And then..

18:07.962 --> 18:09.213
...he kissed me.

18:10.882 --> 18:12.508
I'll never forget that.

18:13.676 --> 18:15.261
I hope mine's that nice.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.972
It will be.

18:18.014 --> 18:20.641
You just wait for the right time

18:18.014 --> 18:20.641
with the right guy.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.185
How will I know?

18:24.395 --> 18:26.105
You listen to your heart.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.314
You'll know.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.192
Thanks.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.611
It's really hard

18:30.234 --> 18:31.611
to talk to the guys

18:31.652 --> 18:34.363
and my dad

18:31.652 --> 18:34.363
about this kinda stuff.

18:34.405 --> 18:36.783
Well, I'm always

18:34.405 --> 18:36.783
here for you.

18:36.824 --> 18:40.160
But don't forget, no matter

18:36.824 --> 18:40.160
what your problem is

18:40.202 --> 18:44.123
your dad, and Uncle Jesse

18:40.202 --> 18:44.123

18:44.164 --> 18:46.000
'cause they love you

18:44.164 --> 18:46.000
very much.

18:47.919 --> 18:50.212
Now, get back

18:47.919 --> 18:50.212
to your party.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.172
Thanks, Becky.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.469
Why couldn't I just

18:54.258 --> 18:56.469
do that to Kevin?

18:58.554 --> 19:00.932
Happy birthday, Deej.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.932
I gotta get home.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.935
- Me too. Bye, D.J.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.935
- Bye. Hope you had fun.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.854
Thank you for coming.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.149

19:10.190 --> 19:11.943
Drive safely.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.863
D.J..

19:15.905 --> 19:17.197
I hope you're not

19:15.905 --> 19:17.197
mad at me about that

19:17.239 --> 19:19.117
spin the bottle stuff.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.577
I just wanted your

19:19.158 --> 19:21.577
13th birthday to be special.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.955
You're my best friend.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.332
Thanks, Kimmy.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.835
You're...one of a kind.

19:31.587 --> 19:34.799
- Ready, babe?

19:31.587 --> 19:34.799
- Wow, I'm a babe.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.551
- Bye. Good party.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.551
- See you at school.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.428

19:43.516 --> 19:45.434
- Hi.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.434
- Bye, Deej.

19:45.476 --> 19:47.020
- Bye.

19:45.476 --> 19:47.020
- Happy birthday.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.729

19:48.771 --> 19:50.023
Goodnight. Thanks, Becky.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.526
You guys need any help?

19:53.567 --> 19:55.528
No, it's still your birthday

19:53.567 --> 19:55.528
for two more hours.

19:55.569 --> 19:56.988
You go live it up, kid.

19:58.072 --> 20:00.741
Well, first

19:58.072 --> 20:00.741
I want to apologize.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.078
I'm sorry I got mad at you guys.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.330
You didn't ruin my birthday.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.749
I was just upset

20:06.372 --> 20:08.749
over some other things.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.045
You wanna talk

20:10.043 --> 20:12.045
about it, honey?

20:12.086 --> 20:14.047
Thanks, but

20:12.086 --> 20:14.047
I feel better now.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.255
But don't feel bad

20:15.297 --> 20:16.549
because I'm sure

20:15.297 --> 20:16.549
I'm gonna have

20:16.590 --> 20:17.842
plenty of other

20:16.590 --> 20:17.842
problems for you guys

20:17.884 --> 20:19.468
to talk to me about.

20:19.510 --> 20:21.470
Well, we certainly hope so.

20:23.430 --> 20:24.640
[knock on door]

20:24.682 --> 20:26.100
I got it.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.398
- Hi. Kevin, right?

20:29.562 --> 20:32.398
- Yeah.

20:32.439 --> 20:33.941
Is it okay if

20:32.439 --> 20:33.941
I talk to D.J.?

20:35.902 --> 20:37.611
Sure, come on in.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.780
Deej, it's for you.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.450
- Hi, Kevin.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.450
- Hi.

20:46.829 --> 20:49.832
Oh, I'll-I'll just go clean up

20:46.829 --> 20:49.832
the living room.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.504
Oh, I'll just

20:53.961 --> 20:55.504
go watch him.

20:58.049 --> 21:02.386
Uh, I'll just continue, uh, my

20:58.049 --> 21:02.386
obedience training with Comet.

21:02.428 --> 21:05.223
Heel, Comet.

21:02.428 --> 21:05.223
Heel, boy.

21:06.224 --> 21:09.227
'Oh, Comet, heel.'

21:09.268 --> 21:11.520
Comet, let's-let's heel, see?

21:11.562 --> 21:13.355
There we go. This is us heeling.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.733
There we go, I'm heeling you,

21:13.397 --> 21:15.733
you're heeling me.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.026
Hey, there..

21:17.068 --> 21:20.404
We'll be in

21:17.068 --> 21:20.404
the living room...heeling.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.826
I found your birthday card.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.954
You came back

21:25.868 --> 21:27.954
just to give me this?

21:27.995 --> 21:29.329
And to tell you

21:27.995 --> 21:29.329
I had nothing to do

21:29.371 --> 21:31.249
with that

21:29.371 --> 21:31.249
"Spin the bottle" setup.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.626
I know.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.626
It was Kimmy's idea.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.586
She thinks

21:33.667 --> 21:35.586
we're the perfect couple.

21:36.712 --> 21:39.173
Hey, nobody can be wrong

21:36.712 --> 21:39.173
all the time.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.969
Well, happy birthday.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.887
Uh, wait, I'll walk you out.

21:52.394 --> 21:55.648
- Thanks again for my present.

21:52.394 --> 21:55.648
- You're welcome.

21:55.689 --> 21:58.276
And thanks for coming back

21:55.689 --> 21:58.276

21:58.317 --> 21:59.652
No problem.
