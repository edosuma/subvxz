WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:02.748
CARTER: Previously on Eureka.

00:02.878 --> 00:04.789
SARAH: There's an unexpected
visitor at the door.

00:04.922 --> 00:05.661
It's Auntie Lex!

00:05.797 --> 00:06.752
Shall I let her in?

00:08.592 --> 00:10.503
NATHAN: Wedding gift
for Allie.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.595
None of us may make it
through the next time wave.

00:14.723 --> 00:15.712
I'll see you around, Jack.

00:18.894 --> 00:19.929
He's gone?

00:20.812 --> 00:22.848
(INDIAN MUSIC PLAYING)

00:26.443 --> 00:29.059
Zoe? Are you
strangling something?

00:29.196 --> 00:31.778
Oh, sorry.
Is the music too loud?

00:31.907 --> 00:33.488
That's music?

00:33.909 --> 00:37.572
Yes, | composed it
in India. It's supposed
to relieve stress.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.740
Really? Yeah,
not working.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.614
Give it a chance.
Sometimes, you have
to let art flow over you

00:42.751 --> 00:45.834
before you can appreciate it.
I'll make you a copy
for your car.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.544
Take your time.

00:47.673 --> 00:49.834
You sure you should be doing
that in your condition?

00:49.967 --> 00:54.210
Yoga's good for the pregnancy,
and since I don't have
a Lamaze partner...

00:54.346 --> 00:56.302
You might,
if you told the father.

00:56.431 --> 00:57.511
He's halfway across the world

00:57.641 --> 00:58.756
curing cholera.
Curing cholera.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.383
Where he belongs.
This baby is my choice.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.262
All right. Well,
you want some coffee?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.401
Dad, you okay?
Yeah.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.688
Sorry. I rearranged
a few things.

01:10.821 --> 01:14.814
For a smart house,
the Feng Shui was really
dumb, no offense, SARAH.

01:14.950 --> 01:17.066
SARAH: None taken.
It's really opened up my flow.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.408
What's in my coffee?

01:18.537 --> 01:21.870
Soy milk. Aunt Lexi says
that lactose gives you gas.

01:22.916 --> 01:26.249
Oh, well, Lex also
says that her cat is
Grandma Lil. No thanks.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.619
Same old Jack,
you always hated change.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.837
Yeah, and you're always
trying to fix things
that aren't broken.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.544
So you're telling me that
everything in your life
is perfect.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.918
Nothing could be improved
just a tiny bit?

01:36.054 --> 01:37.885
Oh, no.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.137
When are you leaving?
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

01:40.267 --> 01:42.508
God, | wish I had a sibling.

01:42.644 --> 01:46.512
Oh, problem at G.D.,
so no more Feng or Shui.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.276
I don't think the
lettering's big enough.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.858
Fargo, if it was any bigger,
it'd cover the whole building.

01:59.494 --> 02:00.483
Your point is?

02:00.996 --> 02:02.987
Hey, guys. You seen Thorne?

02:03.123 --> 02:07.787
Section Three, at the big tomb
opening. There's a protestor
in the Preservation Lab.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.784
What if we changed the font?

02:09.921 --> 02:11.786
What's the plan in here?

02:11.923 --> 02:14.790
We're turning this into the
Nathan Stark Memorial Hallway.

02:15.093 --> 02:19.712
l was hoping for it to be done
before Dr. Blake returned,
but, well, we're close.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.380
Allison's back already?

02:21.516 --> 02:23.347
She said she was
feeling better.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.014
Henry, I'm gonna go grab
the other color swatches.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.262
Here, come on.
I can show you
where Thorne is.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.935
Don't do anything
until I get back.

02:31.526 --> 02:32.732
Wouldn't think of it.

02:32.861 --> 02:33.976
Okay.

02:40.535 --> 02:41.524
FARGO: Here, we go.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.617
Sheriff, finally.

02:42.746 --> 02:45.954
Nice to see you too.
What's the problem?

02:46.333 --> 02:49.245
These people have no
respect for the past,
that's the problem.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.743
You know that isn't true.

02:50.879 --> 02:54.497
We're only attempting this
project because of our
fascination with history,

02:54.633 --> 02:58.046
and Dr. Wilding is
standing in the way
of progress, literally.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.509
I want him arrested.

02:59.638 --> 03:00.878
And you are?

03:01.014 --> 03:03.676
Dr. Sebastian Marx,
archeologist.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.765
I'm sure you've seen
some of my documentaries.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.850
You're a disgrace
to the discipline.

03:07.979 --> 03:10.595
Dr. Wilding is our
resident Egyptologist.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.523
Sheriff, they can't be allowed
to open this tomb.

03:14.486 --> 03:15.896
That's a tomb?

03:17.656 --> 03:19.271
THORNE: For Queen Nyota.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.028
Eureka had a queen?

03:23.704 --> 03:28.198
No, Sheriff Carter,
we brought the whole
tomb from Egypt.

03:28.333 --> 03:32.167
Had to use a superconductor
to generate a massive
anti-gravitational field.

03:32.295 --> 03:35.583
It's protected by
a thermoplastic
multifilament polymer.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.705
Air bags.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.300
Thank you.
Couldn't you just open it
when you were in Egypt?

03:40.804 --> 03:42.840
Not under perfectly controlled
environmental conditions.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.177
Here, we can use
a metasomatic ray to
protect the rock composition

03:46.309 --> 03:48.470
so the tomb won't crumble
when we expose it.

03:48.603 --> 03:51.185
I mean, this is gonna be an
unprecedented achievement.

03:51.314 --> 03:54.056
Then we'll send it out on
an interactive 3D world tour

03:54.192 --> 03:55.978
that will make
King Tut look tame.

03:59.156 --> 04:00.145
(SIGHS)

04:01.533 --> 04:04.741
Dr. Wilding...
If you won't listen to me,
listen to them.

04:04.870 --> 04:07.077
The message on that door
is a warning.

04:07.205 --> 04:10.038
Those are the symbols
for danger and death.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.949
You mean, like a curse?

04:13.420 --> 04:18.084
Curse, legend, lore.
I mean, this tomb has it all.

04:18.341 --> 04:23.256
Inside, the doomed queen
lies shrouded in a cloud
of darkness.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.797
A queen who vows to
one day rise again.

04:26.933 --> 04:27.718
(GRUNTS)

04:27.851 --> 04:29.762
I think I just gave
myselfthe chills.

04:29.895 --> 04:30.850
(LAUGHING)

04:30.979 --> 04:32.389
Um...

04:32.522 --> 04:35.514
I am really, really sorry,

04:35.650 --> 04:40.565
but these people have a job
to do, and I don't want
to have to take you in.

04:43.158 --> 04:47.071
Fine. l've conveyed
their warning.

04:48.163 --> 04:51.280
I strongly suggest
that you listen.

04:56.922 --> 04:58.253
I warned you.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.664
Thank you, Sheriff.
I knew I could count on you.

05:00.801 --> 05:05.170
Well, just be careful.
It's all fun and games
until someone gets cursed.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.096
Hey.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.639
Hey.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.645
Heard you were back.

05:16.608 --> 05:20.772
Yeah, just trying to
catch up on everything.

05:20.904 --> 05:21.893
Yeah.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.147
You sure you're ready?

05:25.283 --> 05:27.274
I mean, it's only been
a couple weeks.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.116
Yeah, I'm fine,

05:30.205 --> 05:32.662
and keeping busy,
you know, it helps.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.501
But I appreciate you
checking in on me.

05:35.627 --> 05:36.867
Listen, um...

05:38.588 --> 05:41.705
l have something for you,
but I'm not sure if
now is the right time.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.298
What is it?

05:44.261 --> 05:50.302
It's a wedding present
from Stark. Nathan.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.766
He asked me
to give it to you.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.055
I could've waited.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.652
No, it's...

06:03.655 --> 06:04.895
Thanks.

06:10.495 --> 06:11.610
Okay.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.610
(WHIRRING)

06:54.205 --> 06:56.241
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Power
sequence initiated.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.827
Metasomatic ray activated.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.841
Tomb pressure equalized.

07:34.204 --> 07:37.822
Now, the tomb has been
untouched for 3,000 years.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.449
Now, we must take great care

07:40.585 --> 07:44.453
to protect this holy site
from being contaminated
by our presence,

07:44.589 --> 07:49.834
to ensure that Queen Nyota's
body and spirit are
preserved forever.

07:49.844 --> 07:50.879
to ensure that Queen Nyota's
body and spirit are
preserved forever.

07:51.680 --> 07:52.669
Come along.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.381
MARX: Yes, yes, look at that.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.643
(SOFTLY) It's wondrous.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.808
(EXCITEDLY) This is wondrous!
Eileen, are you getting this?

08:02.941 --> 08:03.976
EILEEN: You stepped
out of your light.

08:04.109 --> 08:05.269
What?

08:05.402 --> 08:08.018
What? Why didn't you
say anything?

08:08.279 --> 08:09.940
Well, okay. Look,
we got to start from the top.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.610
Is this guy for real?

08:12.784 --> 08:14.445
Well, you have to admire
anyone who can bring

08:14.577 --> 08:17.785
the wonder of scientific
discovery to the masses.

08:18.206 --> 08:21.573
Especially if the masses will
pay top dollar to see it?

08:21.710 --> 08:22.699
It doesn't hurt.

08:23.670 --> 08:28.004
We've just removed the cover
and there she is,

08:28.133 --> 08:30.966
Queen Nyota, entirely intact.

08:32.053 --> 08:35.386
MARX: Now, the linen
that once enshrouded her
has completely dissolved,

08:35.515 --> 08:40.930
but the queen herself
lives on in all her
splendid glory.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.349
Will the legend come true?

08:45.358 --> 08:48.225
Will the queen rise again
to walk the night?

08:48.945 --> 08:51.277
Only time will tell.

09:54.636 --> 09:55.967
(SCREAMS)

10:20.411 --> 10:23.494
Fargo, I swear,
ifthis is a joke...

10:23.623 --> 10:25.864
It was the Mummy Queen,
and she tried to strangle me.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.911
You've seen too many
horror movies.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.288
CARTER: Hello?

10:32.674 --> 10:34.130
Any mummy home?

10:36.052 --> 10:40.295
We desecrated her tomb
and woke her up, and now
she's out for revenge.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.097
Go find Zane!
He's the one you want!

10:43.518 --> 10:44.928
Relax, Fargo.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.978
You can't wake the dead,
unless you're playing
my sister's music.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.096
(CLATTERING)

10:55.822 --> 10:57.278
Oh, God!
Queen Nyota got him.

10:57.407 --> 11:01.821
Oh, it's Dr. Marx.
Dr. Marx? Dr. Marx?

11:03.246 --> 11:04.656
He's alive.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.530
He's not the only one.

11:10.211 --> 11:13.669
FARGO: The sarcophagus...
The mummy's gone.

11:24.976 --> 11:26.056
Allie...

11:27.896 --> 11:29.102
Nathan?

11:30.732 --> 11:31.972
Is that you?

11:33.026 --> 11:34.891
I will always love you.

11:39.824 --> 11:40.813
(GASPS)

12:00.929 --> 12:01.964
Eva...

12:05.016 --> 12:05.801
What happened?

12:05.934 --> 12:07.765
You passed out, Sebastian,

12:08.311 --> 12:10.017
probably dehydration.

12:10.146 --> 12:15.357
After two weeks in the desert
and all day in the tomb,
it's no surprise.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.100
Could I have
some water, please?

12:18.321 --> 12:19.811
Was it the mummy?
Did you see her?

12:19.948 --> 12:20.937
Fargo.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.944
Oh, no, the mummy.

12:25.203 --> 12:26.534
My queen is gone.

12:26.663 --> 12:27.743
Yeah.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.783
So, you don't know
where she is?

12:32.627 --> 12:34.959
No. I went to dinner.

12:35.296 --> 12:38.709
When I came back to get
more footage, the sarcophagus
was empty.

12:38.841 --> 12:42.629
It must have been your
Egyptologist, Wilding.
We have to get her back.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.923
I'm telling you,
it's the curse.

12:46.015 --> 12:50.384
Fargo says that he saw
the mummy in Stark's
Memorial Hallway.

12:50.561 --> 12:53.689
It has nothing to do with
that. I know what I saw.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.771
The queen is alive
and I'm gonna prove it.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.477
Marx accused me?

13:02.532 --> 13:03.942
You should arrest
him for slander.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.441
Well, you did make
quite a scene.

13:06.577 --> 13:09.705
Disturbing Queen Nyota's
remains goes against
everything I stand for.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.822
Yeah, and yet
Marx did it anyway.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.825
Doesn't mean I'd resort to
desecration to make my point.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.668
I respect the ancient
Egyptians far too much
for that.

13:18.673 --> 13:19.913
You know they're dead, right?

13:20.508 --> 13:21.918
They were
the first scientists.

13:22.051 --> 13:26.545
They should be honored
for their achievements, not
turned into a circus sideshow.

13:26.681 --> 13:30.219
Okay. Well, what can you tell
me about Sebastian Marx?

13:30.351 --> 13:32.262
That's not even his real name.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.477
It's Paco Lopez,

13:34.605 --> 13:36.061
and he's been involved
in more than one scandal.

13:36.190 --> 13:40.229
(CHUCKLES) I'll say.
Bribing customs officials,

13:40.361 --> 13:45.355
transporting sacred relics
without proper permits,
tomb raiding.

13:46.951 --> 13:51.536
Marx sold out long ago.
He cares about the spectacle,

13:51.664 --> 13:52.904
not science.

13:53.624 --> 13:56.957
A resurrected mummy would
build a lot of hype
for his little movie.

13:57.086 --> 13:59.168
I wouldn't put it past him.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.379
Yeah, but a mummy hoax?

14:01.507 --> 14:03.418
Still, though, Fargo said
that he saw something.

14:03.885 --> 14:06.217
Fargo is afraid
of his own shadow.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.756
Given his state of mind, I...

14:07.889 --> 14:10.380
It's, yeah, but still,
we should talk to Marx again.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.349
Well, he's doing a
book signing at Cafe Diem.

14:13.478 --> 14:16.436
It's part of Vincent's
Pharaohpalooza event.
I don't know.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.895
All right.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.013
(CLEARS THROAT)

14:20.109 --> 14:21.770
Pharaohpalooza?

14:22.945 --> 14:24.776
Is nothing sacred?

14:26.282 --> 14:27.988
(MIDDLE EASTERN MUSIC PLAYING)

14:33.956 --> 14:37.665
Greetings, fellow Egyptians.
Enjoy this nectar of the Nile.

14:37.794 --> 14:38.829
Thank you, Pharaoh.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.826
Nice costume.
So, where's Marx?

14:41.506 --> 14:44.168
That is a good question.
He's an hour late for
his own book signing.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.666
Oh, celebrities can be
such prima donnas.

14:46.803 --> 14:47.792
Mmm.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.883
Is this coffee?
With pomegranate
creamer in it.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.551
It's Pharaohlicious.

14:52.683 --> 14:56.892
It's disgusting.
Could I get some
real milk, like from a cow?

14:57.021 --> 15:00.229
Absolutely. I shall resurrect
some from the tomb.

15:00.691 --> 15:01.817
That would be the freezer.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.353
I love theme day.

15:03.486 --> 15:06.102
Sheriff, prepare
to be proven wrong.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.195
Are you drinking this?

15:09.117 --> 15:10.573
No, enjoy.

15:10.701 --> 15:11.861
Is that blood?

15:12.870 --> 15:14.781
Fish blood.
Herring, to be exact.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.996
Fargo, people are
trying to eat.

15:17.125 --> 15:20.162
The cells were found in
a fossil pocket in the
Paleontology Lab.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.875
They are thousands
of years old.

15:22.004 --> 15:22.959
So, it's dead fish blood.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.125
Not dead. Regenerated.

15:25.258 --> 15:29.752
A geology experiment brought
the cells back to life.
Oh, but how, you ask?

15:29.887 --> 15:33.846
Metasomatic rays, just like
they used to open the tomb.

15:33.975 --> 15:37.058
And you think a few
fish cells proves that
the mummy was resurrected?

15:37.186 --> 15:40.974
You can't ignore the evidence,
Sheriff. I mean, here, take a
closer look. They're alive.

15:41.107 --> 15:44.099
And they smell.
Yeah. I'm gonna be sick.

15:44.235 --> 15:45.395
Oh, scratch that.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.894
(INDIAN MUSIC PLAYING)
Now, I'm gonna be sick.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.487
Hi, guys. Do you like it?
I have free copies.

15:50.616 --> 15:51.992
Did you compose this?
Mmm-hmm.

15:52.118 --> 15:55.076
It soothes the soul on
a wide range of frequencies,

15:55.204 --> 15:57.991
and there's a whole lot
of tension in this room,
especially from that area.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.489
I'll say.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.536
Tell you what, Sis.
You want to release
some stress?

16:01.669 --> 16:04.081
Talk to Fargo.
He's got some
serious mummy issues.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.044
Come on. Let's go see
Marx at the B & B.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.335
Wait, no. Take this,
for a peaceful drive.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.924
You need it.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.755
All right.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.718
So, tell me about your mother.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.940
You do nice work, Dr. Deacon.

16:31.073 --> 16:35.567
Eva! Hey. Oh, how's it going
with that missing mummy?

16:35.745 --> 16:38.327
Oh, the Sheriff's on the case.
I'm sure she'll be home soon.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.037
All right, anything I can do
to help, just let me know.

16:40.166 --> 16:43.533
Actually, there is one thing.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.125
Do you have any idea
what this is?

16:49.717 --> 16:50.923
A cryptex?

16:51.844 --> 16:55.211
Wow, it's like a type
of combination lock,

16:55.348 --> 16:58.260
although I don't
recognize the symbols.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.848
Do you think you
could open it?

17:00.853 --> 17:01.968
Where did you find this?

17:02.104 --> 17:04.937
Oh, in an alternate location
for the hotel I want to build.

17:05.942 --> 17:10.151
First, it's baryogenic
radiation, and now, it's this.

17:11.239 --> 17:12.820
What are you looking for?

17:13.824 --> 17:16.987
Unfortunately, the
details are classified.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.279
That is unfortunate.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.371
So, I guess I'm gonna
have to find another way?

17:26.504 --> 17:27.584
Hmm.

17:42.853 --> 17:45.310
JO: Marx has been staying here
since he got to town.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.394
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

17:46.524 --> 17:49.015
Dr. Marx,
it's Sheriff Carter!

17:49.610 --> 17:51.191
You sure he's in there?
Well, no one's seen him leave

17:51.320 --> 17:53.402
since he came in last night.

17:53.531 --> 17:54.611
He say anything?

17:54.740 --> 17:56.992
No, just asked
for some water.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.868
How much water?

18:06.002 --> 18:07.333
Dr. Marx?

18:18.014 --> 18:19.879
This place is a sauna.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.758
More like a tomb.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.936
Think we found our mummy.

18:34.322 --> 18:35.903
It's not a mummy.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.034
That's Marx.

18:51.255 --> 18:55.043
Sheriff, Allison,
is Sebastian really dead?

18:55.176 --> 18:59.715
Really dead. I'm afraid he
makes Queen Toyota look good.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.633
Nyota. What happened?

19:01.766 --> 19:04.758
We don't know yet.
Henry's quarantined the body
while he does an autopsy.

19:04.894 --> 19:07.385
Quarantined? Does he think
this is an infection?

19:07.521 --> 19:10.888
The rapid deterioration
of the body is similar
to flesh-eating bacteria.

19:11.025 --> 19:14.392
Sebastian just got back from
Egypt. Maybe he picked
something up there.

19:14.528 --> 19:18.237
Or from the tomb with
the fancy Danger signs
on the door.

19:18.366 --> 19:20.948
Maybe we should've
listened to Wilding.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.450
Anything?

19:25.039 --> 19:27.951
The body is severely
drained of all its fluids.

19:28.959 --> 19:31.951
Well, how do you die
of dehydration in a
tub full of water?

19:32.088 --> 19:36.172
Uh, aggressive
bacterial infection,
fungal spores, poison.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.586
Poison? So this could
have been deliberate?

19:38.719 --> 19:41.005
Because Dr. Wilding
was very upset yesterday.

19:41.138 --> 19:44.881
No, it wasn't him.
I spoke to him, and
it's not in his nature.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.099
And, more than likely,
it spread through contact.

19:47.228 --> 19:49.469
If it had been airborne,
we'd have seen more victims.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.890
Was anyone else
in the tomb with him?

19:51.023 --> 19:54.015
Just his camerawoman,
and I haven't heard
from her since yesterday.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.732
Carter.
Jo and I are on it.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.318
What about the missing mummy?

19:58.447 --> 20:01.280
Shouldn't we be more concerned
about who killed your friend?

20:01.409 --> 20:03.525
That's my only
concern, Sheriff.

20:03.661 --> 20:06.073
If the mummy's infectious,
more lives are at risk.

20:06.205 --> 20:10.790
We've already lost one great
scientist today. I don't want
to lose another.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.325
Excuse me.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.036
Oh, dear.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.552
(CRYING)

20:37.570 --> 20:39.401
I will never leave you again.

20:39.530 --> 20:40.519
(GASPS)

20:41.157 --> 20:42.146
(KNOCKING)

20:42.992 --> 20:43.981
(SOFTLY) Oh, my God.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.532
Allison, are you all right?

20:49.665 --> 20:52.532
Yeah, I'm...
| just thought I...

20:54.295 --> 20:56.035
Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry.

20:56.464 --> 20:57.749
Listen,

20:58.799 --> 21:02.337
I know what
you're going through.
I lost my husband too.

21:03.971 --> 21:04.881
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:05.014 --> 21:09.098
Oh, it was a long time ago,
but still, I know how
difficult it is.

21:10.561 --> 21:12.927
And there will always
be reminders.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.564
And the hard truth is,
you can get past it,

21:17.693 --> 21:21.606
but you'll never get over it,
even if you have all the
time in the world.

21:22.448 --> 21:25.110
I just want you to know
you're not alone.

21:28.913 --> 21:29.993
Thanks.

21:32.041 --> 21:35.249
ZANE: Marx's camerawoman,
Eileen Michaels,
professional documentarian.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.163
She's been with Marx
for the entire excavation.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.752
Okay, and you haven't
seen her since yesterday?

21:38.881 --> 21:41.372
No, she left early.
Said she wasn't feeling well.

21:41.509 --> 21:42.840
Apparently, she never made it
back to the hotel.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.380
Can you see when she logged
out of the building?

21:50.017 --> 21:54.977
Huh. She didn't.
According to security,
she's still here.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.767
Let's hope she hasn't
ended up like Marx.

21:57.900 --> 22:01.484
About that, I've been
doing some research.

22:01.612 --> 22:05.104
These are hieroglyphics from
inside the tomb. They're
an obscure dialect,

22:05.241 --> 22:07.323
but I think they're
describing a plague.

22:07.451 --> 22:08.691
You mean, like a disease?

22:08.828 --> 22:11.945
Maybe Marx got infected
inside the tomb.
All right, we'll call Wilding.

22:12.081 --> 22:14.868
We need to know exactly
what those symbols mean.
I'll keep looking for Eileen.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.456
Oh, not to be
all doom and gloom,

22:16.585 --> 22:19.668
but if she's still alive,
wouldn't someone have
seen her by now?

22:19.797 --> 22:21.958
Maybe someone already has.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.754
Okay, show me
where she was.

22:26.971 --> 22:29.678
Right over there.
I really don't think
we should be in here.

22:29.807 --> 22:31.092
What if the mummy comes back?

22:31.225 --> 22:32.931
I don't think
that's what you saw.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.809
But you said
you believed me!

22:35.938 --> 22:39.101
No, I believe you saw
someone last night,

22:40.317 --> 22:42.603
but just not the walking dead
out for revenge.

22:42.736 --> 22:44.863
Uh, tell that to Dr. Marx.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.399
Henry hasn't finished
the autopsy,

22:46.532 --> 22:48.773
but it seems that Dr. Marx
was killed by an infection,

22:48.909 --> 22:51.616
some kind of
dehydration sickness,

22:51.745 --> 22:53.155
so it makes...

22:57.001 --> 22:58.332
Water.
Hey, what are you...

22:58.460 --> 23:01.497
Don't, don't go in there!
It's not done yet.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.133
This looks bad.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.882
Well, come on, you're not
getting the full effect.

23:11.015 --> 23:14.883
You got to imagine
colored lights, and pink
water lilies, some koi...

23:15.019 --> 23:16.805
All right, Fargo, I don't
think you want to see this.

23:16.937 --> 23:18.177
What?

23:18.314 --> 23:19.474
What?

23:21.942 --> 23:25.150
(EXCLAIMS) It's
the Mummy Queen!

23:25.654 --> 23:26.643
No.

23:27.698 --> 23:29.484
It's Eileen Michaels.

23:30.951 --> 23:34.569
CARTER: Well, the camerawoman
was here all along.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.825
She was in the fountain?

23:37.958 --> 23:41.746
She must have gotten in there
after Fargo ran, like Marx in
the bathtub.

23:41.879 --> 23:44.461
The curse got her.
We're all doomed.

23:44.590 --> 23:47.081
For the last time,
there is no curse.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.718
Then where's
the Mummy Queen?

23:48.844 --> 23:50.425
I'm working on it.

23:52.389 --> 23:55.927
I'm ordering tests on all
G.D. employees, make sure
no one else is infected.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.891
Well, she and Marx
are the only ones

23:58.020 --> 23:59.931
who actually had physical
contact with the mummy.

24:00.064 --> 24:01.929
That we know of.
Someone took her.

24:02.066 --> 24:05.103
Who knows how many more
people are at risk, how many
more people are gonna die?

24:05.235 --> 24:06.691
Okay.

24:06.820 --> 24:10.529
Okay, well, we'll do the
tests. We'll keep our eyes
open for the signs.

24:10.658 --> 24:12.774
And what are
the signs, exactly?

24:12.910 --> 24:14.775
I don't...

24:15.162 --> 24:17.244
Being really, really thirsty?

24:17.373 --> 24:20.786
So, that's what
we're depending on?
People are dying, Carter.

24:20.918 --> 24:21.828
Are you okay?

24:21.961 --> 24:22.950
I'm...

24:23.963 --> 24:25.749
I'm fine. It's...

24:25.881 --> 24:27.621
Come on. Talk to me.

24:28.342 --> 24:32.836
Okay, look, I know this
is gonna sound crazy,
but I swear, I keep hear...

24:32.972 --> 24:33.961
Fargo?

24:35.975 --> 24:37.090
What?

24:39.979 --> 24:41.435
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.814
I knew that stupid curse
would get me too.

24:49.947 --> 24:52.313
Don't worry, Fargo.
We're gonna take care of you.

24:52.449 --> 24:55.737
Oh, sure, like you took
care of Dr. Marx and
Eileen Michaels?

24:55.869 --> 24:58.406
CARTER: You're not gonna
end up like that.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.446
How did he get infected?

25:00.582 --> 25:03.574
Uh, apparently, Eileen
touched him on the neck
before he ran off.

25:03.711 --> 25:05.827
We're checking everyone
that Fargo came in contact
with first,

25:05.963 --> 25:07.828
make sure no one else
has any symptoms.

25:07.965 --> 25:10.206
Yeah, and Wilding and Zane
are trying to learn
all they can

25:10.342 --> 25:12.583
from the symbols inside the
tomb. That's gonna take time.

25:12.720 --> 25:15.177
Where's Henry?
He's doing an autopsy
of Eileen Michaels,

25:15.305 --> 25:17.796
but if that doesn't
provide some answers,
we're in trouble.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.594
Let's hope it does.

25:38.954 --> 25:41.161
HENRY: She just disintegrated
before I could even get
started.

25:41.290 --> 25:44.282
Without water to keep
her hydrated, her body
just turned to dust.

25:44.418 --> 25:45.874
Well, that didn't
happen to Marx.
No.

25:46.003 --> 25:49.086
He was different.
I found hundreds of small
masses inside his stomach.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.294
Growths of some kind.

25:50.424 --> 25:51.914
That's pleasant.
Tumors?

25:52.051 --> 25:54.508
Not that I'd ever seen before.
I'm gonna keep testing.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.137
All right, well, check
Fargo's blood against Marx.

25:56.263 --> 25:57.844
We only have a couple
of hours if we're going
to save him.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.555
We need to find out
what kind of infection
we're dealing with.

26:00.684 --> 26:03.221
All right, and I'll work on
finding out what the symbols
to the tomb mean.

26:03.353 --> 26:05.765
Maybe there's a cure for
the plague, whatever it is.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.058
Right.

26:08.358 --> 26:09.814
Any progress?

26:09.943 --> 26:14.812
Some. See, every language
has its pattern. It's just a
matter of cracking the code.

26:14.948 --> 26:16.779
Zane's been helping me
by filling in the blanks

26:16.909 --> 26:18.615
where the symbols
have faded over time.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.735
I've always been
a puzzle guy.
Well done.

26:20.871 --> 26:24.705
So, did Queen what's-her-name
die from this?

26:24.833 --> 26:25.913
No.

26:26.251 --> 26:30.039
The high priests apparently
killed her themselves

26:30.839 --> 26:32.875
to save her from the plague.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.215
Not exactly a cure
we can use on Fargo.

26:35.344 --> 26:38.711
There's still pieces
that we don't understand,
like this symbol.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.462
It keeps popping up
over and over again.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.305
It looks like
a few clouds.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.550
I still don't understand
who could have taken
the queen out of here

26:48.899 --> 26:51.390
It's like she vanished
into thin air.

26:52.986 --> 26:55.022
Maybe because she did.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.986
I think the reason why
we can't figure out
where the queen went

27:00.119 --> 27:02.201
is because she's been
right here all along.

It's human remains.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.063
How did you know?

27:36.196 --> 27:38.812
Henry said that Eileen
had turned to dust.

27:38.949 --> 27:41.736
I figured maybe
the queen had as well.

27:42.536 --> 27:44.242
If you'd only heeded
the warning.

27:44.371 --> 27:48.489
Well, at least nobody else
had contact with her,
so this should be contained.

27:48.625 --> 27:49.740
Yeah.

27:50.294 --> 27:51.659
To Fargo.

27:56.717 --> 27:58.127
How do I look?

28:00.470 --> 28:02.301
Is that supposed
to cheer me up?

28:02.431 --> 28:03.386
(LAUGHS)

28:04.725 --> 28:05.931
Just hang in there, Fargo.

28:06.059 --> 28:09.597
I mean, Henry's
still working on it,
and we haven't given up.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.391
Neither should you.

28:18.071 --> 28:20.528
You said rehydrating
him would help.
It should.

28:20.657 --> 28:22.818
But the more fluids we
give him, the weaker he gets.

28:22.951 --> 28:23.815
And if you stop?

28:23.952 --> 28:26.739
He dies of dehydration.
Here, look at his blood.

28:26.872 --> 28:30.535
These are microbes.
They're replicating
at an incredible rate.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.783
Those look like little bugs.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.912
It's not like any bacteria
I've ever encountered.

28:38.175 --> 28:40.757
What if we're thinking of
the wrong kind of plague?

28:40.886 --> 28:42.547
What do you mean?

28:42.679 --> 28:45.216
I mean, so far,
we've been thinking
about the disease kind.

28:45.349 --> 28:48.056
What if it's an insect kind?

28:48.644 --> 28:51.135
You think Fargo's been invaded
by microscopic insects?

28:51.271 --> 28:55.105
Well, he showed me this
fish blood that had been
regenerated by a...

28:55.234 --> 28:58.977
A meta, whatever, ray.
Could the same thing happen
to some ancient kind of bug?

28:59.112 --> 29:02.525
Well, under certain
conditions, insects
can enter cryptobiosis.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.819
It's a natural state
of suspended animation.

29:04.952 --> 29:07.944
They can survive indefinitely
until rehydrated.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.196
Like sea monkeys?

29:10.332 --> 29:12.038
Same principle, but...

29:13.293 --> 29:16.831
Which explains why rehydrating
Fargo is making him worse.

29:16.964 --> 29:18.420
The insects are multiplying.

29:18.548 --> 29:20.584
And what if they're exposed
to a large amount of water,

29:20.717 --> 29:22.582
er,say,an
overflowing bathtub?

29:22.719 --> 29:26.758
It could speed metamorphosis,
like a caterpillar turning
into a butterfly.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.300
Okay, take care of Fargo.
Okay.

29:28.433 --> 29:29.422

to you for a second.

Hey. We need to lock down
that tent, make sure nothing
can get out.

the tiniest of microbes.

30:54.978 --> 30:56.934

of threat is it?

hatch larvae, and
then seek out new hosts.

Us.

Egyptians deal with
the problem?

31:05.906 --> 31:09.319
They killed the infected
and burned their city
to the ground.

31:09.451 --> 31:11.282
Let's call that Plan B.

31:11.411 --> 31:14.448
According to our guys in
Entomology, these bugs are
going to grow exponentially

31:14.581 --> 31:16.162
now that they've emerged.

31:16.291 --> 31:19.909
Hold on. How could the bugs
grow in Marx but not Eileen?

31:20.045 --> 31:23.503
Probably incubation.
To fully develop,
the larvae need water.

31:23.632 --> 31:24.587
Yeah, but they were
both in water.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.581
I mean, Eileen was in the
fountain. Marx was in the tub.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.174
So maybe there was
something in the fountain

31:28.303 --> 31:30.760
that killed the larvae
before they could undergo
metamorphosis.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.504
I'll go test the water.

the town. I have no idea.

comes from the underground

41:44.419 --> 41:45.909
I know what you're thinking,

41:46.045 --> 41:49.708
"I can barely handle
one Nathan. What am
I gonna do with two?"

41:50.591 --> 41:52.252
Well, don't worry.

41:52.677 --> 41:57.137
All I've done is imprint
a small part of myself
onto this diamond,

41:58.182 --> 42:02.801
the way that you have
imprinted yourself

42:02.937 --> 42:04.052
onto me.

42:05.940 --> 42:09.558
If marriage is aboutjoining
two people for eternity,

42:09.694 --> 42:12.151
I wanted to be sure

42:12.280 --> 42:14.862
that no matter where you are,

42:14.991 --> 42:17.482
or where I am,

42:17.618 --> 42:19.995
I will always be with you.

42:21.956 --> 42:24.572
I made mistakes
the first time, Allie.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.369
I know that.

42:27.670 --> 42:31.037
But I promise you, this time,

42:33.009 --> 42:34.795
this time is forever.

42:36.054 --> 42:37.794
Allie,

42:37.930 --> 42:39.795
I will always love you.

42:40.433 --> 42:42.094
And I will never,

42:43.186 --> 42:44.346
ever,

42:44.979 --> 42:46.515
leave you again.

42:47.106 --> 42:48.095
(CRYING)

42:56.074 --> 42:57.689
Goodbye, Nathan.
