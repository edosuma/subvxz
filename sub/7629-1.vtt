You lost a football game once yourself.

MR. TEASDALE: And the great hunt
would always begin

03:33.179 --> 03:36.273
with the armies spread out
in a semi-circle,

03:36.349 --> 03:39.011
I would say about the size of Rhode Island.

03:39.552 --> 03:44.080
Then they would ride forward,
driving everything before them.

03:44.991 --> 03:49.087
Beasts, men, even bugs.

03:51.097 --> 03:55.158
Now, the ends would kind of
close in to form a shrinking circle.

03:55.835 --> 03:59.066
Everything within that circle
panicked to get out.

03:59.272 --> 04:01.797
When the Mongols could see each other

04:02.008 --> 04:05.500
they had worked themselves up
into a pretty good frenzy.

04:07.113 --> 04:09.206
Now, when this killing started,

04:10.516 --> 04:13.917
it'd last for days, weeks,

04:14.587 --> 04:16.077
even months.

04:17.190 --> 04:19.249
And it went on

04:19.459 --> 04:22.622

04:23.563 --> 04:26.691
asked his father
that the last creature alive

They shot him.

30:58.623 --> 31:00.591

31:00.658 --> 31:03.422
so they shot him for aiding guerillas.

31:05.496 --> 31:08.761
What do you mean '"aiding guerillas'"?
He never aided anybody.

- We killed him.

He's not the guerilla type.

According to the records, Mayor,

41:50.207 --> 41:54.371
your son is a prominent student leader.

41:54.445 --> 41:58.575
Yes. Well, he is a leader,
but not in a violent or physical way.

41:58.949 --> 42:03.613
No, you see, Daryl is more
of a politician, like his father.

42:05.623 --> 42:10.458
A member of an elite paramilitary
organization, Eagle Scout.

42:10.794 --> 42:13.194
Yes, but that's not military.

42:13.531 --> 42:16.625
Now look, Colonel, if he's alive,
he's scared, he's hungry,

42:16.700 --> 42:18.930
and he's just as anxious to avoid conflicts
as you and me.

with selective nuke strikes,
