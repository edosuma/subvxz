00:19.186 --> 00:21.155
(door chimes)

00:22.189 --> 00:24.225
-Hey, man.
-Oh, hey, Ed. What's up?

00:24.259 --> 00:25.626
Hey, it's after shift.
I was gonna see

00:25.660 --> 00:26.727
if you want to get a beer.

00:26.761 --> 00:28.162
Oh, I-I totally would,

00:28.195 --> 00:29.830
but I'm all jammed up here.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.599
Oh, all good.
Just figured I'd check.

00:31.632 --> 00:34.302
Jammed up.
Like, I'm in my jammies.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.336
Yeah, no, I-I got it.

00:35.370 --> 00:36.571
-Just making sure.
-All right, cool.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.005
-Have a good sleep.
-Will do, brother.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.140
-All right.
-(door chimes)

00:40.174 --> 00:43.444
Hey, Captain, what's up?

00:43.478 --> 00:45.680
Hey, John, I was just seeing
what you were up to.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.415
I was thinking about grabbing
a drink in the mess hall.

00:47.448 --> 00:50.585
Oh. Well, man,
that-that's really nice of you,

00:50.618 --> 00:53.321
-but right now
is not-not the best time. -Oh.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.822
That's all good. No worries.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.056
John, who is it?

00:56.090 --> 00:57.825
(coughs) Oh, Captain.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.694
Ensign Turco, hey. (laughs)

00:59.727 --> 01:01.496
-Uh, listen, I'm sorry
to bother you guys. -Hey, no.

01:01.529 --> 01:03.331
It's all right. It's all good.

01:03.364 --> 01:06.000
Do you want to come in
and have a drink with us?

01:06.033 --> 01:07.902
You know, I just remembered

01:07.935 --> 01:09.169
I have an early morning
tomorrow, so I...

01:09.203 --> 01:10.905
-Oh, dang, that's a shame.
-Okay.

01:10.938 --> 01:12.407
-Yeah.
-Hmm. -Yeah, dang.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.509
-Hey, get those Zs, though.
-I will.

01:14.542 --> 01:15.943
-Okay. All right.
-Okay. -I will.

01:15.976 --> 01:18.045
-Good night.
-Yeah.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.250
(door chimes)

01:23.284 --> 01:25.520
Captain.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.355
Is there a problem?

01:27.388 --> 01:28.923
Oh, there's no problem.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.224
I was just seeing
what you're up to.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.126
Am I suspected of some misdeed?

01:32.159 --> 01:33.594
(laughs):
No, Bortus,

01:33.628 --> 01:35.195
for God's sake,
this is a social call.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.197
I-I just wanted to see
if you wanted to have a drink.

01:37.231 --> 01:41.135
Klyden and I
have just put Topa to bed.

01:41.168 --> 01:44.705
You are welcome to join us
for a glass of Opsadda.

01:44.739 --> 01:47.074
Whatever that is, sounds great.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.185
Thanks.

01:58.218 --> 01:59.920
It is aged nine years.

01:59.954 --> 02:02.423
The perfect duration
for good Opsadda.

02:02.457 --> 02:05.225
Man, if it, uh,
looks like this going in,

02:05.259 --> 02:07.261
I'm afraid of what it looks like
coming out.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.029
Opsadda does not come out.

02:09.063 --> 02:11.399
It grows into a parasite
within the body.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.267
The sensation

02:13.300 --> 02:16.303
is intensely pleasurable.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.339
Mmm.

02:21.409 --> 02:22.843
Hmm.

02:22.877 --> 02:24.779
That's excellent.

02:24.812 --> 02:28.015
So, um...

02:28.048 --> 02:30.017
what do Moclans do
for fun off duty?

02:30.050 --> 02:32.019
Do you guys play,
like, board games

02:32.052 --> 02:33.187
or anything like that?

02:33.220 --> 02:35.289
There is a popular Moclan game

02:35.322 --> 02:38.058
called Latchkum
that we play from time to time.

02:38.092 --> 02:39.460
Oh, well, break it out. Show me.

02:39.494 --> 02:41.896
I do not believe
you would enjoy it.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.465
-It is not for humans.
-Come on. You know what?

02:44.499 --> 02:46.333
There's so much I don't know
about your culture.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.202
I-I want to... I want to learn.

02:49.804 --> 02:52.239
I will pass the Latchkum to you,

02:52.272 --> 02:54.308
then you pass it

02:54.341 --> 02:56.243
to whomever you wish
as quickly as possible.

02:56.276 --> 02:58.212
All right.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.555
So, what, does this just go on

03:07.588 --> 03:09.790
until somebody... (screams)

03:09.824 --> 03:11.158
-Latchkum!
-Latchkum!

03:11.191 --> 03:13.260
(Ed crying)

03:34.715 --> 03:37.317
Hey. You awake, too?

03:37.351 --> 03:39.186
Yeah. Can't sleep.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.855
They were wrong
about the Opsadda.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.256
It does come out.

03:42.289 --> 03:43.758
-What?
-Nothing.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.292
My God, what happened
to your hand?

03:45.325 --> 03:47.327
Oh, this. (chuckles)

03:47.361 --> 03:49.564
I was playing a Moclan game
with Bortus.

03:49.597 --> 03:52.166
What's insane is
apparently I won.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.701
You should go down to sickbay
and get that fixed.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.536
The explanation
for how this happened

03:55.570 --> 03:57.505
is not something I want on file.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.339
I was gonna ask you
to borrow a dermoscanner

03:59.373 --> 04:01.609
from Claire tomorrow
and smuggle it to me.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.043
No problem.

04:03.077 --> 04:04.411
Hey, do you feel like going down

04:04.445 --> 04:06.046
to the mess hall for a late one?

04:06.080 --> 04:08.415
Sure.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.852
Oh, God.

04:11.886 --> 04:14.154
That is a lot better
than Bortus' poo drink.

04:14.188 --> 04:16.323
(chuckles)

04:16.356 --> 04:18.225
Oh.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.227
The mess hall on a weeknight.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.362
It's actually really pretty
when it's empty like this.

04:22.396 --> 04:25.365
Yeah, it is.

04:25.399 --> 04:27.768
You know, I've been doing
a lot of thinking

04:27.802 --> 04:29.870
since Darulio was on board.

04:29.904 --> 04:32.072
So have I.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.240
You have?

04:33.273 --> 04:34.408
Yeah.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.243
I mean, he basically implied

04:36.276 --> 04:39.079
that it was the Retepsian
pheromone that made you...

04:39.113 --> 04:40.114
I know.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.282
Right? And so that means...

04:42.316 --> 04:44.785
maybe it wasn't really
your fault.

04:44.819 --> 04:47.021
I guess we'll never know
for sure,

04:47.054 --> 04:50.257
but that's generous
of you to say.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.426
No, it's not.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.796
My motives
are completely selfish.

04:55.830 --> 04:57.164
Really?

04:57.197 --> 04:59.567
I, um...

04:59.600 --> 05:02.069
I miss you.

05:03.638 --> 05:05.640
And, you know, I was lying
in my quarters tonight,

05:05.673 --> 05:07.642
and I was thinking to myself,

05:07.675 --> 05:11.512
"Man, I have been lonely
this past year."

05:11.546 --> 05:13.480
And I-I had just gotten

05:13.514 --> 05:16.250
so used to putting you
out of my mind

05:16.283 --> 05:17.752
that I just
never even considered

05:17.785 --> 05:19.253
getting back together.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.455
And then that happened.

05:21.488 --> 05:25.292
Do you...
want to get back together?

05:25.325 --> 05:29.063
What do you say
we do a date this week?

05:29.096 --> 05:31.599
Like a... like a real date,
like we used to do.

05:31.632 --> 05:35.002
I think that's a wonderful idea.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.704
Good. So do I.

05:38.773 --> 05:41.141
Whoa. Easy. We're moving

05:41.175 --> 05:43.143
into uncharted space tomorrow.
You don't want to be hungover.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.012
Call it a celebratory drink.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.881
All right. Screw it.
Let's do this.

05:59.459 --> 06:01.195
I'll never get used
to that sight.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.731
An uncharted star
that's just waiting for us

06:03.764 --> 06:05.332
to come along and discover it.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.967
It's amazing, isn't it?

06:07.001 --> 06:08.468
-It's really bright.
-(sighs)

06:08.502 --> 06:10.537
Isaac, can you reduce
the illumination on the viewer?

06:10.571 --> 06:13.407
Reducing illumination by 20%.

06:14.609 --> 06:16.276
-(computer beeping)
-BORTUS: Captain,

06:16.310 --> 06:18.345
I am picking up
some unusual readings.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.215
It is a distortion of some kind.

06:21.248 --> 06:22.683
Coming from the star?

06:22.717 --> 06:23.818
ISAAC:
Negative.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.352
It appears to be emanating

06:25.385 --> 06:27.121
from beyond
the star's photosphere

06:27.154 --> 06:29.323
in open space.

06:29.356 --> 06:31.325
Do... Um... (clears throat)

06:31.358 --> 06:32.593
C-Could you...

06:32.627 --> 06:34.394
Do you mind shutting off
that beeping, please?

06:34.428 --> 06:35.896
Oh. Yeah, sorry.

06:35.930 --> 06:37.231
-(beeping stops)
-(exhales) Oh, thank you.

06:37.264 --> 06:39.266
ISAAC:
These readings are most unusual.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.702
It appears
to be a spatial anomaly,

06:41.736 --> 06:44.071
but scanners
cannot clearly process it.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.673
Captain, I would like
to take a shuttle

06:45.706 --> 06:47.541
to investigate at closer range.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.910
(yawning):
Or we could just

06:49.944 --> 06:51.879
come back tomorrow
and see if it's still here.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.348
ISAAC: This could be a find
of some importance.

06:54.381 --> 06:56.516
It would be foolish
to squander the opportunity.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.185
It's fine. I'll go with you.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.319
Gordon, you're with us.

06:59.353 --> 07:01.121
Uh, Bortus, have Chief Lamarr

07:01.155 --> 07:02.289
take the helm.

07:02.322 --> 07:04.224
Kelly, no unnecessary risks.

07:04.258 --> 07:07.061
-All right? Give it
a wide berth. -Don't worry.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.096
We'll make it quick.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.133
(sighs)

07:20.040 --> 07:22.677
Approaching the coordinates
of the anomaly.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.144
(exhales) Okay, slow us down.

07:24.178 --> 07:25.545
Aye, sir.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.214
Commander, these readings

07:27.247 --> 07:29.984
-do not make any logical sense.
-What do you mean?

07:30.017 --> 07:31.251
It is almost as if the fabric

07:31.285 --> 07:33.353
of space itself is...

07:35.990 --> 07:37.091
Lieutenant, what is it?

07:37.124 --> 07:38.625
Commander, this can't be right.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.560
It's atmosphere.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.062
That's impossible.
We're in space.

07:42.096 --> 07:43.330
Not anymore.

07:45.632 --> 07:46.901
ED:
My God.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.168
What is that?

07:48.202 --> 07:49.636
It is a planet.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.238
I know it's a planet.
Where the hell did it come from?

07:51.271 --> 07:53.908
-It just appeared.
Out of thin air. -Captain,

07:53.941 --> 07:56.310
I'm picking up a signal
from the shuttle. Audio only.

07:56.343 --> 07:57.244
Put 'em on.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.412
KELLY (over comm):
Shuttle to Orville.

07:58.445 --> 07:59.680
We've lost partial helm control.

07:59.714 --> 08:01.315
Unable to stabilize.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.183
We're gonna try to set down
somewhere if we can.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.355
Where the hell are we?

08:12.526 --> 08:14.528
♪

09:19.860 --> 09:21.862
(groans)

09:23.197 --> 09:26.266
This is not the day
for a hangover.

09:26.300 --> 09:27.567
ED (over comm):
Orville to shuttle.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.336
-You guys okay?
-Uh, yeah.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.838
We're a little banged up,
but we're okay.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.840
What happened?

09:32.873 --> 09:34.775
Captain, it appears
the instantaneous transition

09:34.809 --> 09:36.210
from vacuum to atmosphere

09:36.243 --> 09:38.545
caused an overload
in the engine core.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.047
I believe
Lieutenant Malloy and I

09:40.080 --> 09:41.548
can repair it within the hour.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.183
-ED (over comm): You're sure?
-Yes, Captain.

09:43.217 --> 09:45.185
All right. We'll keep
this channel open just in case.

09:45.219 --> 09:47.754
Bortus,
begin multispectral scans.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.356
I want to know
everything there is to know

09:49.389 --> 09:50.991
about that planet
and where it came from.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.226
Aye, sir.

10:02.336 --> 10:04.738
I'm gonna take a look around.

10:04.771 --> 10:05.940
Don't leave without me, huh?

10:05.973 --> 10:08.575
-We'll be here.
Oh, hey, Commander... -What?

10:08.608 --> 10:10.744
Please don't tell anybody
how much I screamed

10:10.777 --> 10:12.379
when I thought
we were gonna crash.

10:17.451 --> 10:20.320
(scanner beeping)

10:39.473 --> 10:40.941
Grayson to shuttle.

10:40.975 --> 10:42.342
GORDON (over comm):
Malloy here.

10:42.376 --> 10:44.845
There are life-forms
on this planet. Humanoid.

10:44.879 --> 10:46.580
I see a village in the distance.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.182
You're kidding.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.449
It looks like
Bronze Age-level development,

10:49.483 --> 10:50.985
but it's hard to tell.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.187
I'm gonna try
to get a closer look.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.788
Commander, I remind you
to use caution.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.256
Any contact with a culture

10:56.290 --> 10:57.424
-that primitive...
-Yeah, I know.

10:57.457 --> 10:59.226
Cultural contamination.
I don't need you

10:59.259 --> 11:00.727
to remind me of the rules.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.263
I am merely attempting
to be helpful, Commander.

11:03.297 --> 11:04.598
There is no need to be...

11:04.631 --> 11:08.002
What does Captain Mercer
call it? Pissy.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.904
I won't let them see me.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.872
Grayson out.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.380

Oh, my God.

11:36.730 --> 11:39.266
Are you okay? Can you hear me?
Are you okay?

11:39.299 --> 11:41.902
Hey. Hey. Can you hear me?
Are you okay?

11:44.238 --> 11:46.040
Wait! Please, wait.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.376
I'm not gonna hurt you,
I promise.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.479
My name is Kelly.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.448
Kelly.

11:54.481 --> 11:57.217
I want to help.

11:57.251 --> 11:59.253
That's a pretty nasty cut
you have there.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.088
Will you let me fix it?

12:05.359 --> 12:07.427
I can use this
to make it better.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.166
That's right.
It's okay.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.834
Come on.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.104
See? It's nothing scary.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.173
Watch.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.975
It's okay.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.351
See?

12:31.385 --> 12:32.987
All better.

(rustling nearby)

12:36.423 --> 12:38.758
Oh, crap.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.494
Feel better, honey.
Time for me to go.

12:44.798 --> 12:48.335
Kel-ly...

12:58.112 --> 13:01.348
♪

13:01.381 --> 13:04.318
Well, we've got one hell of
a mystery on our hands here.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.785
How do you want us
to handle this?

13:05.819 --> 13:07.787
You'll remain in orbit
another 72 hours

13:07.821 --> 13:09.123
to continue scanning.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.957
If we're still in the dark
after that,

13:10.991 --> 13:12.592
we'll send a science vessel
to relieve you.

13:12.626 --> 13:13.960
All right.
Thanks, Admiral.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.329
Ozawa out.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.831
Why didn't you tell her?

13:17.864 --> 13:20.100
You helped out a kid,
that's all.

13:20.134 --> 13:22.302
And cultural contamination

13:22.336 --> 13:24.771
of a society that undeveloped
is a serious charge.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.573
I just don't want to have
to come visit you in prison.

13:26.606 --> 13:29.276
Really? You wouldn't want
to visit a women's prison?

13:29.309 --> 13:30.677
You're right,
I'll call her back.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.913
Ed. You didn't have to do that.

13:33.947 --> 13:36.250
What I did was stupid
and careless.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.218
And you shouldn't have
to cover for me.

13:38.252 --> 13:40.420
(inhales, exhales sharply)
Look,

13:40.454 --> 13:43.423
Union policy would've had you
leave that kid to die.

13:43.457 --> 13:45.459
Just to avoid cultural
contamination.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.227
I think you did the right thing.

13:47.261 --> 13:50.164
And you got out of there
as quick as you could.

13:50.197 --> 13:53.367
I just forgot to include it
in my report.

13:54.701 --> 13:57.337
Well, I owe you one.

13:57.371 --> 13:59.806
We still owe each other a date.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.850
Okay, it's officially been
12 hours.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.519
Isaac, you have
to have something.

14:12.552 --> 14:15.155
Negative, Captain. There is
still nothing in the scans

14:15.189 --> 14:17.324
to offer insight
into the planet's origin.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.426
We should get, like, a Monopoly
game going or something.

14:19.459 --> 14:20.827
Is this too many people?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.496
I will fetch the Latchkum.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.299
No! No, no.
We-We'll-we'll just sit here.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.001
Captain!

14:29.169 --> 14:30.504
The planet just disappeared.

14:32.506 --> 14:34.341
What the hell is going on here?

14:34.374 --> 14:37.244
Sir, I may have a theory.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.346
I believe
what we have encountered

14:39.379 --> 14:42.182
is a planet locked in
a multiphasic orbit.

14:42.216 --> 14:44.684
Okay, let's pretend
I don't know what that is.

14:44.718 --> 14:47.187
-Do you know what that is?
-I do not.

14:47.221 --> 14:49.256
-So we could just say that.
-Thanks, buddy.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.224
Isaac, what is it?

14:50.257 --> 14:51.925
A multiphasic orbit

14:51.958 --> 14:54.728
has only been hypothetical
up until this point.

14:54.761 --> 14:58.332
A planet orbits a star,
but its orbit is divided

14:58.365 --> 15:00.867
between two universes,
ours and another.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.203
-Well, that's trippy.
-What about the star?

15:03.237 --> 15:05.972
The star itself,
or one closely comparable,

15:06.005 --> 15:08.742
would need to exist in both
universes for the planet

15:08.775 --> 15:10.110
to retain a stable environment.

15:10.144 --> 15:12.212
Since there are humanoid
life-forms there,

15:12.246 --> 15:14.314
we can assume that is the case.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.816
Well, so what now? I mean,
how do we follow the trail?

15:16.850 --> 15:18.385
We could wait for the planet

15:18.418 --> 15:21.054
-to re-enter our universe.
-How long will that take?

15:21.087 --> 15:23.623
The planet is circling in
a tight orbit around the star.

15:23.657 --> 15:26.660
Based on the mass of the star
and the geometry of the orbit,

15:26.693 --> 15:28.061
about 11 days.

15:28.094 --> 15:31.598
Well, then...
looks like we wait.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.733
Just sit in orbit for 11 days?

15:33.767 --> 15:35.169
What are we supposed to do?

15:43.843 --> 15:46.146
Mmm. Oh, my God.

15:46.180 --> 15:48.582
I forgot what a terrible cook
you are.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.116
-It's awful, isn't it?
-(laughing): Yeah.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.985
It's terrible. See, you know,
I was afraid of that

15:52.018 --> 15:53.953
and I didn't want to use
synthesized food tonight,

15:53.987 --> 15:55.389
so I made a backup.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.228
Peanut butter and jelly is
impossible to screw up.

16:01.261 --> 16:04.097
-What are we, 12?
-Yes, we're 12.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.732
And afterward,
I'm gonna pull your hair

16:05.765 --> 16:08.268
and call you fat and that's how
you'll know I like you.

16:08.302 --> 16:10.270
(laughs) I think on Bortus'
planet that's foreplay.

16:10.304 --> 16:12.339
-I think you're right.
-(both laugh)

16:14.974 --> 16:16.410
Oh, my God.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.278
This is so much better.

16:18.312 --> 16:20.347
You know, this is surreal.

16:23.950 --> 16:25.819
I was just thinking that.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.854
(clears throat)

16:29.323 --> 16:32.091
You know,
these jobs we've chosen,

16:32.125 --> 16:34.461
they condition you to...

16:34.494 --> 16:36.930
be okay being by yourself.

16:36.963 --> 16:39.933
And after a while,

16:39.966 --> 16:42.336
you start to think that...

16:42.369 --> 16:46.206
giving yourself over
to someone else

16:46.240 --> 16:48.508
is some kind of weakness.

16:48.542 --> 16:51.645
Even though it's exactly
what you need.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.047
You want to keep
your independence,

16:54.080 --> 16:55.949
but you're frightened
of loneliness.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.984
Yeah.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.124
This is just jelly.

17:05.158 --> 17:06.593
Yeah. This is peanut butter.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.728
Okay, see,

17:08.762 --> 17:10.129
I figured you might not want
to kiss me,

17:10.163 --> 17:12.566
and I know how much you like
peanut butter and jelly,

17:12.599 --> 17:15.001
and I thought maybe if you were
hungry enough...

17:15.034 --> 17:16.870
Plus, I'm a terrible cook,
and so I didn't want

17:16.903 --> 17:18.505
to mix 'em together because I'd
probably screw up the portions,

17:18.538 --> 17:20.407
and I don't have a
measuring cup, so it's a...

17:32.185 --> 17:34.220
You're a much better cook
than I am. (chuckles)

Incredible.

Captain,

18:13.627 --> 18:16.162
-this is most unusual.
-What is it?

18:16.195 --> 18:18.264
My scans of the planet's surface

18:18.298 --> 18:21.200
-are showing radical
alterations. -In what way?

18:21.234 --> 18:23.637
It is my understanding that you
described the civilization

18:23.670 --> 18:26.039
on the planet as comparable
in development

18:26.072 --> 18:28.141
-to Earth's Bronze Age.
-I did.

18:28.174 --> 18:31.878
Scans are now showing much more
extensive architecture,

18:31.911 --> 18:33.680
and a profound increase
in the number of life-forms

18:33.713 --> 18:35.214
on the surface.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.850
But that is impossible.

none of it was there.

We've reached the coordinates
where Kelly saw the village.

a rather profound discovery

19:35.975 --> 19:37.276
about this planet,

19:37.310 --> 19:39.178
which your description appears
to support.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.547
What do you mean?

19:40.580 --> 19:43.316
Scans have revealed
a temporal inconsistency

19:43.349 --> 19:45.118
indicating that when the planet

19:45.151 --> 19:47.353
moves out of our universe
and into the other,

19:47.387 --> 19:50.156
its time constant undergoes
an acceleration.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.958
Can you translate that
for dumb guys

19:51.991 --> 19:53.326
who might also be
a little drunk?

19:53.359 --> 19:55.529
11 days have passed for us.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.164
But for the planet,
approximately 700 years

19:58.197 --> 20:00.133
-have elapsed.
-Wait.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.201
You're telling me that
seven centuries have passed

20:02.235 --> 20:03.703
since I was here before?

20:03.737 --> 20:05.539
ISAAC:
That is correct, Commander.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.874
All right, Union Central's gonna
want whatever we can give them,

so let's take a look around.
Isaac,

20:10.209 --> 20:12.345
focus a tight scanning beam
on the city.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.147
Got to know what these people
are wearing, if we're gonna

20:14.180 --> 20:16.315
-synthesize the proper clothing.
-JOHN: Captain.

20:16.349 --> 20:19.486
There might be a faster way.

of light-years from Earth

Oh, crap.

Good day to you, travelers.

22:37.323 --> 22:38.692
Excuse me.

22:38.725 --> 22:41.194

22:41.227 --> 22:43.229
who these people are.

22:43.262 --> 22:44.698
Who they were.

22:44.731 --> 22:46.365
It's a shame.

22:46.399 --> 22:48.234
Some people never see the light.

22:48.267 --> 22:50.069
Did they commit some crime?

22:50.103 --> 22:51.905
Indeed, the very worst.

put on display
as a lesson to others

22:55.241 --> 22:57.376
who would consider
forsaking the Word.

22:57.410 --> 22:59.679
What word?

22:59.713 --> 23:01.280
Why, the Word of Kelly.

23:17.363 --> 23:19.365
(indistinct conversations)

23:26.940 --> 23:29.743
There you are, Dalen.
What did I say to you?

All the time.

23:39.152 --> 23:40.887
She knows when you've been bad,

23:40.920 --> 23:43.356
and she'll punish you.
Now, come on.

23:43.389 --> 23:45.391
-Let go of that.
-Ed, this is a nightmare.

23:45.424 --> 23:48.027
-(bell ringing)
-Bring out the accused.

24:00.039 --> 24:04.043
These three
are accused of theft.

24:04.077 --> 24:05.679
They will now be judged.

24:07.146 --> 24:10.616
Ow! Aah!
(whimpering)

24:10.650 --> 24:13.820
(whispers): Hey, hey,
whatever you're thinking, don't.

24:14.821 --> 24:16.823
(screams)

24:19.458 --> 24:22.261
(grunts)

24:24.263 --> 24:26.265
Oh, great and mighty Kelly,

24:26.299 --> 24:29.135
we present to you
these three accused,

24:29.168 --> 24:32.305
so that you may,
in your infinite wisdom,

24:32.338 --> 24:36.075
reveal to us their innocence
or their guilt.

24:36.109 --> 24:39.212
If they be honest and true,

24:39.245 --> 24:41.080
we ask you to heal them now.

24:41.114 --> 24:43.149
-No, Kel-Kelly, no.
-Ed, I have to stop this.

24:43.182 --> 24:46.185
-If I tell them to stop, they
will. -Think for a second, okay?

24:46.219 --> 24:49.155
You're gonna go up there and
do what-- issue a commandment?

24:49.188 --> 24:51.691
That is quite possibly the worst
thing you could do right now.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.330
Captain, there's
a large central structure

24:57.363 --> 24:58.998
just to the north of here.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.102
Let's go.

25:20.119 --> 25:22.889
Oh, yeah,
we're in a lot of trouble.

25:29.062 --> 25:30.529
Why the hell
didn't you include this

25:30.563 --> 25:31.697
in your initial report, Ed?

25:31.731 --> 25:33.132
Look, Admiral, I apologize.

25:33.166 --> 25:35.668
I just didn't think
it was of consequence.

25:35.701 --> 25:38.204
One of your officers
has direct contact

25:38.237 --> 25:40.473
with a primitive
alien civilization

25:40.506 --> 25:41.875
and you don't think
that's of consequence?

25:41.908 --> 25:43.877
-Well, I...
-A religion has developed

25:43.910 --> 25:45.344
around your first officer.

25:45.378 --> 25:47.213
Look, I know this
is really bad, all right?

25:47.246 --> 25:49.182
But it wasn't Kelly's fault,
all right?

25:49.215 --> 25:51.317
The shuttle never intended to go
down there in the first place.

25:51.350 --> 25:53.186
I am aware
of the circumstances, Captain.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.721
It's the only reason you still
have bars on your shoulder.

25:55.755 --> 25:58.324
But hear this loud and clear:
If you ever again

25:58.357 --> 26:01.727
edit a report to protect
one of your officers,

26:01.761 --> 26:04.163
you'll find yourself scrubbing
toilets at Union Point.

26:04.197 --> 26:05.965
Do you understand me?

26:05.999 --> 26:07.300
-Yes, sir.
-I'm putting

26:07.333 --> 26:09.836
a letter of reprimand
in your permanent file.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.905
What do you want us to do
about the planet?

26:11.938 --> 26:15.041
A culture that progresses
700 years every 11 days

26:15.074 --> 26:18.211
is bound to achieve space travel
in less than a month.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.745
Let them come to you.

26:19.779 --> 26:22.348
You're not to return
to the surface before then.

26:22.381 --> 26:25.218
-That's an order. -But, Admiral,
maybe we could convince them...

26:25.251 --> 26:26.585
That's an order.

26:26.619 --> 26:27.620
Understood.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.058
-"That's an order."
-What?

26:32.091 --> 26:34.027
Oh, my God, I'm sorry,
I thought you hung up. I'm s...

26:34.060 --> 26:35.428
Oh, God,
I'm so sorry. Please,

26:35.461 --> 26:36.762
Admiral, have mercy, please.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.064
Thank you.
Okay, bye.

26:49.742 --> 26:52.111
Look... Kel, I'm sorry,

26:52.145 --> 26:55.114
but you can't blame yourself
for any of this.

26:55.148 --> 26:58.918
I watched three people
murdered in my name.

26:58.952 --> 27:00.586
Five others already dead.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.022
And a mother telling her child
that if he misbehaved,

27:03.056 --> 27:04.824
"Kelly will get him."

27:04.858 --> 27:07.093
You're damn right
I blame myself.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.262
And now I'm forbidden
to even try and fix it.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.097
I mean, how many more people
are gonna die

27:11.130 --> 27:12.598
down there in the name of Kelly?

27:12.631 --> 27:15.301
Thousands? Millions?

27:15.334 --> 27:17.203
If there's anything at all
I can do...

27:17.236 --> 27:19.272
No. Just...

27:19.305 --> 27:21.307
I want to be alone.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.725
(door chimes)

27:39.758 --> 27:41.494
Oh.
(clears throat)

27:41.527 --> 27:42.962
Come in.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.835
Get dressed.
We're going back.

28:05.952 --> 28:07.853
(over comm):
Isaac to Captain Mercer.

28:07.887 --> 28:10.223
-Go ahead, Isaac.
-You have 31 minutes

28:10.256 --> 28:12.158
until the planet
phases out of our universe.

28:12.191 --> 28:14.593
Acknowledged.
Mercer out.

28:14.627 --> 28:16.629
(bell tolling)

28:21.700 --> 28:23.937
Valondis.

28:23.970 --> 28:26.472
Forgive me for interrupting
your refreshment.

28:26.505 --> 28:28.674
This boy was caught eating fruit

28:28.707 --> 28:30.709
from a tree on church lands.

28:32.345 --> 28:34.313
-Is this true?
-Your Grace,

28:34.347 --> 28:36.182
I beg your forgiveness.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.584
My family's poor,
and my mother is ill.

28:38.617 --> 28:40.319
I would not have
taken the fruit,

28:40.353 --> 28:43.822
but... we've not eaten in days.

28:43.856 --> 28:46.692
Were there witnesses
to this act?

28:46.725 --> 28:48.861
-Yes, Your Grace.
-Very well.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.264
Take him to the square
and cut him.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.066
If he speaks the truth,

28:53.099 --> 28:55.534
-Kelly will heal his wound.
-No!

28:55.568 --> 28:58.671
Your Grace, please.
Be merciful.

28:58.704 --> 29:01.174
Kelly is merciful, my young one.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.775
No! Please.

29:02.808 --> 29:04.743
Stop.

29:04.777 --> 29:07.413
Who are you? The Valondis
does not see peasants.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.415
Remove them at once.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.284
We are not peasants.

29:13.386 --> 29:16.089
-(gasps)
-(gasps)

29:29.668 --> 29:31.670
Oh, merciful Kelly.

29:31.704 --> 29:34.540
It's... it's you.

29:34.573 --> 29:35.808
Yeah.

29:35.841 --> 29:37.376
Valondis, is it?

29:37.410 --> 29:38.644
Get up.

29:38.677 --> 29:40.313
I am not worthy.

29:40.346 --> 29:41.747
You're worth more
than you think.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.049
Now get up.

29:43.082 --> 29:45.951
I have waited my entire life

29:45.985 --> 29:47.987
for the blessing
of your arrival,

29:48.021 --> 29:51.757
and now you are here
in all your magnificence.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.160
Look, there's been
a little misunderstanding.

29:54.193 --> 29:55.628
I'm not who you think I am.

29:55.661 --> 29:57.263
VALONDIS:
But you are.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.964
Healer of men.

29:58.998 --> 30:01.367
Divine hand of the heavens.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.569
God of all creation.

30:03.602 --> 30:06.205
Man, this guy'd be
the perfect boyfriend.

30:06.239 --> 30:08.474
Listen to me.
I'm not any of those things.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.909
I'm a living, mortal being,

30:10.943 --> 30:12.278
-exactly like you.
-That's right,

30:12.311 --> 30:13.579
and she's God, so you know

30:13.612 --> 30:14.980
she's telling the truth.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.549
Yeah, that-that's not helping.

30:16.582 --> 30:18.784
But our sacred scrolls
tell clearly

30:18.817 --> 30:22.121
of the first time
you descended from above.

30:22.155 --> 30:24.323
What exactly
do your scrolls say?

30:24.357 --> 30:26.959
They tell of a young girl
who was injured.

30:26.992 --> 30:30.163
You came down
from your mountaintop domain

30:30.196 --> 30:32.165
and healed her with your touch.

30:32.198 --> 30:34.900
Okay, first of all, I would
never live on a mountaintop.

30:34.933 --> 30:36.969
I'm not an outdoorsy person.
Second of all,

30:37.002 --> 30:39.004
I didn't heal that girl
with my touch.

30:39.038 --> 30:40.606
I used a tool.

30:40.639 --> 30:43.776
Like you would use a garden hoe
or a-a hammer.

30:43.809 --> 30:46.179
It's just a little more
advanced, that's all.

30:47.380 --> 30:49.848
Okay, pay attention.

30:49.882 --> 30:51.884
I'm gonna show you
exactly how I did it.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.126
But you bleed.

31:00.159 --> 31:02.528
Now watch.

31:11.370 --> 31:14.407
Oh, blessed be the heavens.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.509
We have witnessed the miracle.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.677
No, it's not a miracle.

31:18.711 --> 31:20.146
It's just a machine.

31:20.179 --> 31:22.681
Like a plow you might use
in one of your fields.

31:22.715 --> 31:24.317
Here, you try it.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.291
(groans)

31:32.325 --> 31:35.228
Here. Push that button
right there

31:35.261 --> 31:37.263
and run this over your hand.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.041
Butdid this?

31:49.074 --> 31:51.877
Exactly.
You did that, not me.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.347
Because it's the machine
that heals.

31:54.380 --> 31:56.349
But the Great Healing

31:56.382 --> 31:58.751
was 700 years ago.

31:58.784 --> 32:01.086
Surely, you are immortal.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.856
No.
Time just moves differently

32:03.889 --> 32:05.558
for my people
than it does for you.

32:05.591 --> 32:08.627
For every 700 years that pass
for you, only 11 days

32:08.661 --> 32:11.297
-pass for us.
-Isaac to Captain Mercer.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.368
-Go ahead.
-The planet

32:15.401 --> 32:18.604
will begin its dimensional shift
in approximately nine minutes.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.206
Acknowledged.

32:20.239 --> 32:23.142
Kelly. We got to go.

32:23.176 --> 32:25.978
Valondis, I'm a traveler
from a faraway place

32:26.011 --> 32:28.181
who has impacted your world
in a way that my people

32:28.214 --> 32:30.283
try to avoid at all costs.

32:30.316 --> 32:33.586
But I am not a god.

32:33.619 --> 32:35.321
Do you believe me?

32:36.355 --> 32:39.057
I have seen you bleed.

32:39.091 --> 32:41.560
A god does not bleed.

32:41.594 --> 32:44.563
Exactly. We are living mortals,
just like you.

32:44.597 --> 32:47.433
Kelly, we really have to go,
or we're gonna be trapped here.

32:47.466 --> 32:51.170
Please, spread the word
far and wide to your people.

32:51.204 --> 32:54.139
Kelly does not deserve
their worship.

32:54.173 --> 32:57.109
Will you do that?

32:57.142 --> 32:59.011
For me?

32:59.044 --> 33:01.980
I wish you good journeys,

33:02.014 --> 33:05.117
Kelly the Traveler.

33:26.305 --> 33:28.841
Valondis?

33:30.343 --> 33:32.611
May I ask what you plan to do?

33:32.645 --> 33:35.314
I do not know.

33:35.348 --> 33:37.950
But this cannot be kept
from the people.

33:37.983 --> 33:40.619
They must know
what has happened.

33:40.653 --> 33:42.788
Surely that would be a mistake.

33:42.821 --> 33:46.292
-How so? -The belief in Kelly
is not merely a source

33:46.325 --> 33:48.093
of comfort for the people.

33:48.126 --> 33:50.229
They fear her, as well.

33:50.263 --> 33:53.999
And as the guardians of
the Word of Kelly, they fear us.

33:54.032 --> 33:57.069
Should that fear come into
doubt, our ability to govern

33:57.102 --> 33:59.272
may be compromised.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.507
But the truth must never
be compromised.

34:04.343 --> 34:06.545
The people must decide
for themselves.

34:06.579 --> 34:09.181
As you wish.

34:11.384 --> 34:13.085
-(grunts)
-(gasps)

34:13.118 --> 34:15.821
(gasps)

34:15.854 --> 34:18.223
(groans)

34:33.238 --> 34:35.941
Captain,
scans indicate the planet

34:35.974 --> 34:38.711
is about to reemerge
into our universe.

34:48.354 --> 34:51.123
I am detecting artificial
satellites in orbit.

34:51.156 --> 34:53.892
There are indications
of computer technology,

34:53.926 --> 34:57.396
industrial pollution and
wide-range broadcast signals.

34:57.430 --> 35:00.766
Scan broadcast signals
for any mention of Kelly.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.401
Scanning.

35:02.435 --> 35:05.604
749,682 results.

35:05.638 --> 35:07.239
No.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.575
(sighs)

35:09.608 --> 35:11.744
Let's see what you've got.

35:11.777 --> 35:14.547
And the Word of Kelly was spoken
unto them,

35:14.580 --> 35:18.216
and they did marvel
at her glory!

35:18.250 --> 35:22.254
And she said to them,
"You shall be healed."

35:22.287 --> 35:25.458
A depiction of the First Healing
in a publicly-funded

35:25.491 --> 35:27.626
educational facility
is inappropriate.

35:27.660 --> 35:29.261
PUNDIT: How is a depiction
of our collective

35:29.294 --> 35:31.897
-theological heritage
inappropriate? -Some people

35:31.930 --> 35:34.767
don't believe Kelly has a place
in secular education.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.603
Fine. Then they can enroll their
child in a different facility.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.138
REPORTER: The bloodshed
continues in outer Jakora

35:40.172 --> 35:43.742
today as dissidents launched
an attack on the Temple of Kelly

35:43.776 --> 35:45.310
in the city of Uravah.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.212
More than 36 people were killed

35:47.245 --> 35:49.114
-Isaac, turn it off.
-when a series of detonations

35:49.147 --> 35:51.484
rocked the ancient city.

35:56.254 --> 35:57.756
What went wrong?

35:57.790 --> 35:59.224
I thought you convinced them.

35:59.257 --> 36:01.259
It's time.

36:01.293 --> 36:03.629
There just wasn't enough time.
If I had a week or

36:03.662 --> 36:05.964
a month down there, I might be
able to see it through, but...

36:05.998 --> 36:07.866
What if we left something there?

36:07.900 --> 36:10.235
A message of some kind
that could remain

36:10.268 --> 36:11.937
after we lose the planet?

36:11.970 --> 36:13.506
Or someone.

36:13.539 --> 36:16.742
What? What are you saying?

36:16.775 --> 36:19.144
I'm saying...
what if I stayed behind?

36:19.177 --> 36:22.314
To help guide them out of
the mess that I got them into.

36:22.347 --> 36:25.150
-Kelly, you'll die there.
-I know.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.653
-No. That's not an option. -Ed,
people are still getting killed.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.287
That's not an option.

36:29.321 --> 36:30.689
Look, you want
to spend your retirement years

36:30.723 --> 36:32.625
on an alien planet
with no way to get back?

36:32.658 --> 36:36.829
And keep in mind, this is now
a society in the computer age.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.296
All right, what if... what if

36:38.330 --> 36:39.331
they don't believe
you're really their god?

36:39.364 --> 36:41.734
What if they lock you up
in an asylum?

36:41.767 --> 36:43.836
Captain, I could go.

36:43.869 --> 36:47.105
-You?
-Yes, sir.

36:47.139 --> 36:49.141
My artificial construct
is capable

36:49.174 --> 36:51.043
of enduring
for millions of years.

36:51.076 --> 36:53.646
And I do not process
the passage of time

36:53.679 --> 36:55.681
-in the way you do.
-JOHN: Isaac,

36:55.714 --> 36:57.516
you'd be there
for seven centuries.

36:57.550 --> 36:59.452
I am aware of this,
Chief Lamarr.

36:59.485 --> 37:01.887
Well, how would you do it?
Just walk in and say,

37:01.920 --> 37:04.156
"Hi. I'm from another planet.
I'm here to fix you"?

37:04.189 --> 37:07.726
I would not put it so artlessly,
but... yes.

37:07.760 --> 37:11.196
Isaac, it's 700 years.

37:11.229 --> 37:14.066
700 seconds to me, Captain.

37:23.842 --> 37:25.243
GORDON:
Shuttle to Orville.

37:25.277 --> 37:26.745
Go ahead, Gordon.

37:26.779 --> 37:29.014
Isaac is on the surface.
I'm on my way back.

37:29.047 --> 37:30.382
Acknowledged.

37:30.415 --> 37:32.417
Isaac, can you hear me?

37:32.451 --> 37:33.952
Yes, Captain.

37:33.986 --> 37:35.854
I have arrived safely.

37:35.888 --> 37:37.856
Isaac...

37:37.890 --> 37:40.559
I'll never be able to repay you
for what you're doing.

37:40.593 --> 37:43.361
ISAAC: Recompense is
unnecessary, Commander.

37:43.395 --> 37:46.398
Captain, I believe the planet
is beginning to phase.

37:46.431 --> 37:49.468
We will not be able
to communicate much longer...

37:59.144 --> 38:01.413
We'll see you soon.

38:10.322 --> 38:14.292
ED (over comm):
Mercer to Grayson.

38:14.326 --> 38:16.361
Yes, Captain?

38:16.394 --> 38:19.464
I thought you'd want to know
the planet is about to reemerge.

38:19.498 --> 38:21.233
I'm on my way.

38:29.608 --> 38:32.077
BORTUS:
Captain,

38:32.110 --> 38:33.679
scans are detecting the planet.

38:35.614 --> 38:38.083
You okay?

38:38.116 --> 38:39.685
Yes.

38:41.253 --> 38:42.354
No.

38:42.387 --> 38:44.623
It is reemerging.

38:51.630 --> 38:54.266
ALARA:
My God.

38:54.299 --> 38:55.868
Look at it.

38:55.901 --> 38:58.103
Captain, there is a vessel
approaching.

39:09.782 --> 39:12.918
ALARA: Sir, the alien ship
is hailing us.

39:12.951 --> 39:15.153
They're asking permission
to come aboard.

39:16.822 --> 39:19.157
(sighs)
Granted.

39:21.093 --> 39:22.561
(whooshing)

39:24.329 --> 39:26.331
Greetings, Captain Mercer.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.300
Commander Grayson.

39:28.333 --> 39:31.203
We thought it was about time
we returned your artificial

39:31.236 --> 39:33.038
life-form to you.

39:40.846 --> 39:43.215
Isaac, how did you do it?

39:43.248 --> 39:45.183
It was quite fascinating
to be able

39:45.217 --> 39:47.152
to study the evolution
of a society from

39:47.185 --> 39:50.989
the computer era to the age
of quantum drive in real time.

39:51.023 --> 39:53.158
But I did not have to...
do anything.

39:53.191 --> 39:54.993
I don't understand.

39:55.027 --> 39:56.895
FADOLIN:
Commander,

39:56.929 --> 39:59.231
Isaac has been a part
of our world for centuries.

39:59.264 --> 40:02.668
When he arrived 700 years ago,
it shook the planet,

40:02.701 --> 40:05.871
but we quickly became used
to his presence, and our world

40:05.904 --> 40:07.673
advanced just
as it would have without him.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.308
But... you no longer
believe in Kelly.

40:10.342 --> 40:14.446
Only in the sense that she's
a human aboard a Union starship.

40:14.479 --> 40:18.717
I am so very, very sorry for all
of the trouble that I've caused.

40:18.751 --> 40:21.519
Don't be. We've been waiting
for the phasing

40:21.553 --> 40:23.689
to occur again
so we could meet you.

40:23.722 --> 40:27.325
Our society has become
a spacefaring culture

40:27.359 --> 40:30.128
with ships spread out
across the galaxy.

40:30.162 --> 40:32.230
In our home universe, that is.

40:32.264 --> 40:34.199
But we wouldn't have gotten

40:34.232 --> 40:36.201
where we are
without growing pains.

40:36.234 --> 40:39.337
Our planet worshipped you
as a deity for many centuries.

40:39.371 --> 40:40.873
But had it not been you,

40:40.906 --> 40:43.175
the mythology would have found
another face.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.377
It's a part
of every culture's evolution.

40:45.410 --> 40:47.345
It's one of the stages
of learning.

40:47.379 --> 40:50.215
And eventually,
it brought us here.

40:50.248 --> 40:51.984
So you see, Commander,

40:52.017 --> 40:54.286
you didn't poison our culture
with false faith.

40:54.319 --> 40:56.354
We flourish.

40:56.388 --> 41:00.592
You must have faith...
in reason,

41:00.625 --> 41:06.231
in discovery and in the
endurance of the logical mind.

41:06.264 --> 41:10.235
It won't be long before
you advance millennia past us.

41:10.268 --> 41:13.171
Perhaps then, we will study you.

41:13.205 --> 41:16.274
We'd be honored.

41:23.248 --> 41:25.684
♪

41:28.854 --> 41:31.256
Hey.

41:31.289 --> 41:33.425
Hi.

41:33.458 --> 41:37.129
You don't exactly look
ready to relax.

41:37.162 --> 41:40.632
No. I'm not.

41:40.665 --> 41:42.200
Do you still want to get drunk?

41:42.234 --> 41:45.603
Ed...

41:45.637 --> 41:48.106
this isn't gonna work.

41:48.140 --> 41:51.043
You mean us.

41:52.344 --> 41:54.346
None of this should have
happened.

41:54.379 --> 41:57.349
You defied an admiral's orders
to protect me,

41:57.382 --> 42:00.953
and it sent our science officer
into a 700-year exile.

42:00.986 --> 42:04.222
You and I, together...

42:04.256 --> 42:06.324
it jeopardizes your command.

42:06.358 --> 42:08.693
It jeopardizes the smooth
operation of this ship,

42:08.727 --> 42:11.396
and it jeopardizes
our friendship.

42:11.429 --> 42:13.165
It can't happen.

42:13.198 --> 42:16.301
(sighs)

42:16.334 --> 42:18.336
When I'm really honest
with myself,

42:18.370 --> 42:19.905
I know that you're right.

42:21.673 --> 42:24.342
But that doesn't change
the way I feel.

42:24.376 --> 42:26.644
I know.

42:26.678 --> 42:29.514
But for now,

42:29.547 --> 42:32.384
those are feelings
we need to forget.

42:34.686 --> 42:37.589
Dismissed, Captain?

42:38.857 --> 42:41.359
Dismissed, Commander.

42:47.265 --> 42:49.267

42:57.342 --> 43:00.545
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

43:43.121 --> 43:45.057
