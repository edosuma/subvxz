00:03.462 --> 00:06.341
There's this cage, in hell.
And it's where they keep Lucifer.

00:06.507 --> 00:09.886
And I've been in it.
I think God wants me to go back.

00:10.761 --> 00:13.310
That wasn't God
inside your head, Sam.

00:13.472 --> 00:14.519
It was me.

00:14.723 --> 00:15.815
Your brother's in Hell.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.654
The Darkness, she's the end of everything.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.736
We can beat her.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.237
With Lucifer.

00:21.438 --> 00:22.940
You want a vessel?

00:23.148 --> 00:24.195
No.

00:24.399 --> 00:25.616
Plan B.

00:27.819 --> 00:30.447
- Last words?
- Can you really beat her?

00:30.739 --> 00:32.616
- I can.
- Then yes.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.120
Lucifer.

00:36.912 --> 00:38.630
The Darkness. What is she to you?

00:38.789 --> 00:39.961
You'll never hurt me.

00:40.249 --> 00:41.796
I'm sorry, Amara.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.594
We're bound, Dean.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.005
I told you.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.891
We'll always be bound.
I can't be resisted.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.394
That feeling that you have
when you're with me.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.523
Just... Bliss. Why wouldn't you want that?

00:55.681 --> 00:57.775
You and I will be together. Forever.

01:21.957 --> 01:24.836
Padraic? Oh, what are you doing?

01:25.919 --> 01:27.421
She loves this song.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.803
It's the only thing
that'll put her to sleep.

01:36.972 --> 01:38.440
Oh, besides...

01:39.391 --> 01:40.517
This is our song.

01:42.686 --> 01:45.610
It's good to see you smiling, mo chuisle.

01:46.898 --> 01:48.400
I'm trying, Maura.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.027
I'm trying.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.949
Oh, do you hear that?

01:55.324 --> 01:57.292
That would be our daughter.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.953
No. I hear

02:00.495 --> 02:01.496
a scream.

02:02.748 --> 02:04.591
It's...

02:05.751 --> 02:08.220
Hold on, Padraic, just hold on!

02:13.884 --> 02:15.352
Get it out of my head!

02:21.725 --> 02:23.068
Hold on!

02:35.697 --> 02:37.290
Get away from him!

02:55.717 --> 02:56.764
No!

03:17.739 --> 03:19.992
It'll be okay, sweetie.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.460
It'll be okay.

03:40.887 --> 03:44.187
When your brother was trapped
in Purgatory, you were here.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.976
With a girl and a dog.

03:46.143 --> 03:48.771
You can't win this, Sam.
You're just not strong enough.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.860
You didn't even bother trying to find him.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.490
And I know that
if you're gonna beat the Darkness,

03:52.649 --> 03:57.155
you have to be ready to watch
the people you love die.

04:07.831 --> 04:08.832
Hey.

04:09.499 --> 04:10.546
Hey.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.177
How long you been up?

04:12.377 --> 04:13.594
I don't know.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.926
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.351
Are you sure? 'Cause you haven't
left the bunker in days.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.308
I'm fine.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.766
Well, good,
'cause I think I found us a case.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.900
"Harold Miller, 65.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.061
"A resident of Oak Park, “
it's an old folks' home,

04:30.228 --> 04:32.509
"was found yesterday in his room
with his head bashed in."

04:32.647 --> 04:35.408
But get this. The doors were locked
and there was no sign of break in.

04:38.653 --> 04:39.700
Ghost?

04:39.863 --> 04:41.410
Demonic possession?

04:45.118 --> 04:46.918
I figure it's worth a look.
What do you think?

04:47.245 --> 04:50.749
Oh, and best part is,
Oak Park is fifteen minutes from here.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.585
It's in our backyard.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.045
And what about the Darkness?

04:55.587 --> 04:57.305
What about Cass?
We haven't heard from him.

04:57.589 --> 05:00.263
Okay, first of all,
we've got zero on Amara.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.803
And Cass? Cass'll be fine. He always is.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.287
Come on! Let's go!

05:28.662 --> 05:30.255
You've gotta catch it!

06:22.966 --> 06:25.845
All the parks in the world,
and I pick one with an angel in it.

06:26.803 --> 06:29.602
I saw you. Couldn't believe my eyes.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.187
Oh, believe them.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.857
It's beautiful out here, isn't it?

06:38.315 --> 06:42.445
It's funny, the things you think
you're not gonna miss at all,

06:42.652 --> 06:45.155
you end up missing the very, very most.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.582
- Enjoy it while you can.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:47.824 --> 06:48.825
I come in peace, brother.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.744
I am not your brother, Lucifer.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.670
Well, I'm not looking for a fight.

06:54.497 --> 06:58.752
In fact, I am your only hope
at beating the Darkness.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.512
I heard you, uh...

07:00.670 --> 07:04.174
I heard you kids had your big shot
at the title and missed it.

07:06.885 --> 07:09.183
You don't need to be afraid, brother.

07:09.346 --> 07:12.520
I am out of that awful, awful cage.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.026
And I'm here to save you all.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.479
Lucifer ex machina.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.070
It cannot be destroyed. But you could be.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.328
Ugh.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.782
That's the problem
with you rank-and-file angels.

07:29.366 --> 07:30.709
No vision.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.545
Hmm. Hmm.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.567
Seriously?

08:01.231 --> 08:02.949
This place is an old folks' home?

08:03.358 --> 08:04.701
It looks awesome.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.551
Maybe we ought to make a reservation.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.998
Yeah, we should be so lucky
to live long enough.

08:15.453 --> 08:16.705
As I told the police,

08:17.038 --> 08:19.257
I was walking by Harold's room,

08:19.416 --> 08:21.259
and I heard a loud banging noise.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.921
And then I heard Harold yell
from inside of his suite,

08:24.087 --> 08:25.555
"Get it out of my head!"

08:27.632 --> 08:29.352
So, I knocked on the door
and called to him,

08:29.426 --> 08:33.147
and when he didn't reply,
I used my passkey to get into his room.

08:34.431 --> 08:37.275
That's when I saw him. He was on his back.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.061
His skull was, um...

08:40.270 --> 08:41.510
Well, there was a lot of blood.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.110
And nobody else was in the room?

08:43.273 --> 08:45.275
No.
The windows and doors were locked.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.115
I even checked the security logs.

08:47.277 --> 08:49.780
Nobody was in or out
of Harold's room all night.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.031
Hmm.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.281
I don't really understand
what could have happened.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.500
Hmm.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.123
Hey, Mildred.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.583
Oh, good morning, Arthur.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.266
This is Mildred, one of our residents.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.290
Ah.

09:01.124 --> 09:02.125
Good morning.

09:02.792 --> 09:03.839
Hi.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.634
- Yeah?
- Um... You always work late at night?

09:11.134 --> 09:13.307
I've been, uh, staying here, actually.

09:13.595 --> 09:14.972
My wife left me.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.941
Via text, if you can believe it.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.568
A whole series of emojis. Hi.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.149
Huh. What'd you do?

09:22.312 --> 09:23.438
Oh, I didn't stand for that.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.531
Uh-uh. Fought fire with fire.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.284
I sent her the poop emoji.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.029
Well, that's one way to fly.

09:31.196 --> 09:34.200
I should have sent the heart.
I can be so stupid.

09:34.491 --> 09:37.119
Hi. I just wish she'd call me back.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.631
Oh, no, no,
I think you did the right thing.

09:39.746 --> 09:43.592
Um... Hey, listen, since you've been
staying here, uh, a lot

09:43.750 --> 09:49.052
uh, have you noticed any strange
sounds, smells, uh, cold spots?

09:49.506 --> 09:51.508
What? Uh, no. Why?

09:52.050 --> 09:54.018
- Oh, just routine questions. Um...
- Hmm.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.221
What about enemies?
Harold have any enemies?

09:58.473 --> 09:59.816
Actually...

10:00.558 --> 10:01.855
He had quite a few.

10:13.571 --> 10:14.788
What the hell?

10:17.200 --> 10:20.545
Turns out Harold was stealing
the other residents' Viagra.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.040
I know. It's a real dick move, huh?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.718
So, I got an EMF hit in his room,

10:27.877 --> 10:30.972
but I got an EMF hit on pretty much
every floor in the building.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.633
How many people died in this place?

10:32.799 --> 10:34.767
Arthur, the, uh, heartbroken manager,

10:34.926 --> 10:36.726
he gave me access
to all the residents' files.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.688
This is everyone who has passed here.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.064
Now, uh,

10:41.391 --> 10:43.268
this guy, Jake Townsend,

10:44.269 --> 10:46.522
had a beef with Harold,
but it wasn't over blue pills.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.649
Whoa.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.067
Jake filed a formal complaint
against Harold?

10:51.234 --> 10:53.703
Yeah. Apparently, Harold
was stealing his pension checks

10:53.862 --> 10:55.022
and cashing them for himself.

10:55.113 --> 10:58.367
Now, when Jake died, his family filed
a civil suit against Harold,

10:58.533 --> 11:00.706
but it just got caught up in the courts
and never went to trial.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.083
So, maybe Jake stuck around
as a vengeful spirit.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.756
Took matters into his own hands.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.176
All right.
So, where's Jake Townsend buried?

11:25.101 --> 11:26.227
- Dude.
- Mmm?

11:27.270 --> 11:29.443
Oh, you got this.
You got it, you're doing great.

11:32.567 --> 11:33.944
So, no retirement, huh?

11:34.485 --> 11:37.113
Hey, you're the one who's always wanted
to go out Blaze of Glory style.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.453
Preferably while
the Bon Jovi song is playing.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.329
Lam a candle in the wind.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.014
Yeah, but the way you said it was like

11:45.079 --> 11:48.174
that Blaze of Glory was gonna happen
sooner rather than later.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.262
Are you okay?

11:56.299 --> 11:57.801
No, I'm not, actually, not at all.

12:00.011 --> 12:01.809
Being so close to Lucifer again, that...

12:03.765 --> 12:05.142
Brought stuff up.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.319
Stuff I thought I forgot about.

12:10.021 --> 12:12.319
You wanna talk about it?

12:13.691 --> 12:14.692
No.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.993
Well, look. Lucifer is never
getting out of that cage. Ever.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.578
And you are never going back. Period.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.164
So, case closed.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.622
And so is this one.

12:35.505 --> 12:38.509
Kind of nice being back on a case, huh?
Get your mind off of things.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.768
Just burn the bones so we can go home.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.079
See you then. Okay.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.348
You up to some trouble, young lady?

13:03.408 --> 13:05.285
Always, Arthur.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.001
Oh. Do you hear that?

13:09.872 --> 13:11.715
No. Are you all right?

13:14.377 --> 13:16.050
It's okay. We've got back-up generators.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.596
- Really? You can't hear that?
-  No.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.056
Oh, it sounds like someone's screaming.

13:28.391 --> 13:29.734
What is that?

13:33.062 --> 13:34.314
I don't see anything.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.409
Get it out of my head!

13:38.609 --> 13:42.785
Arthur, I don't hear anything!
Tell me what to do! I...

13:47.243 --> 13:48.620
Oh, my God.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.541
Arthur.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.928
Arthur?

14:00.548 --> 14:01.845
Arthur!

14:22.070 --> 14:26.166
Arthur said he heard
something like a scream.

14:27.158 --> 14:29.206
And did you hear anything?

14:29.744 --> 14:31.087
I didn't hear a thing.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.758
Except the sound of Arthur bashing
his head through that window.

14:37.293 --> 14:42.094
He just wanted that noise to stop.
He said, "Get it out of my head!"

14:42.423 --> 14:45.597
Mmm. Did you notice anything else?
A drop in temperature...

14:45.760 --> 14:48.138
No. But the power went out.

14:48.805 --> 14:52.480
And when I looked through
the broken window, I saw something.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.982
What did you see, exactly?

14:56.354 --> 14:59.654
You're not gonna believe me.
They certainly didn't.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.489
But I know what I saw.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.824
This isn't my first brush
with something like this.

15:03.986 --> 15:06.455
I saw a ghost ten years ago.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.958
Nobody believed me then, either.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.752
We believe you, Ms. Baker.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.001
- Oh, Agent Osbourne, thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

15:15.164 --> 15:18.259
I feel so much safer knowing
the FBI is looking into this.

15:20.086 --> 15:24.683
Well, that's... I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna need my hand back, so...

15:24.841 --> 15:25.842
on.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.055
Okay.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.228
Ms. Baker, what did you see?

15:32.473 --> 15:33.770
It was a woman.

15:34.684 --> 15:39.235
Long, flowing hair. Blood-red robes.
Sunken eyes.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.024
And, and she was

15:42.608 --> 15:44.781
feeding on Arthur's head.

15:47.864 --> 15:50.083
I'm so sorry. Um, excuse me one second.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.667
Oh, please don't leave me, Agent Osbourne.

15:54.829 --> 15:56.752
No, no. We're not going anywhere.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.382
Yeah.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.210
Excuse me. Ma'am?

16:03.045 --> 16:05.548
Ma'am? Sorry. Uh...

16:07.300 --> 16:08.301
Marlene.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.519
Special Agent Butler, FBI.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.065
Do you know anything about
what happened with Arthur last night?

16:15.016 --> 16:16.893
Sorry. I wasn't working last night.

16:18.811 --> 16:22.736
Oh, um, were you working the night
Harold Miller died?

16:26.068 --> 16:28.912
All right, um, thanks.

16:30.031 --> 16:32.705
Um, "Thanks."

16:32.867 --> 16:36.417
Right, of course.
Uh, sorry, I, I only know a little.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.699
I took some back in college.
But that was a while ago.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.547
Most people don't know any.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.628
I appreciate the try.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.723
I should probably, uh, get back.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.350
Yeah, uh, thank you.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.313
- Witness?
- No.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.938
Okay, so, apparently, not a ghost.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.603
No. No, ghosts don't feed on
busted-open heads.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.898
Yeah. All right,
I'll check with the coroner.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.738
See if anything was missing
from our first vic's brain.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.449
Fingers crossed it's zombies.
We can get our Walking Dead on.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.714
Yeah, I got it. Okay, thanks again.

17:21.624 --> 17:25.378
So, according to the coroner,
part of Harold's frontal lobe was missing.

17:26.837 --> 17:29.135
And that tracks with banshees.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.299
Banshees?

17:30.925 --> 17:32.142
I thought banshees were good.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.019
The ones tied to the fairy lore are.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.681
They cry out as a warning
to a victim's impending death.

17:36.847 --> 17:40.943
But these guys are malevolent banshees.
Total dickbags.

17:41.102 --> 17:44.572
They use their, uh, piercing scream
to drive their prey crazy.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.482
Forces the vics to crack open
their own eggs

17:46.649 --> 17:48.322
and then the banshees feed on the yolk.

17:48.734 --> 17:52.659
Oh, and the only people who can hear
the banshees' scream are the vics.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.117
Well, that would explain
why Mildred didn't hear anything.

17:56.284 --> 17:58.207
Oh, and they, uh, travel through mist,

17:58.369 --> 18:00.792
which explains how they
got into Harold's locked room.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.333
And they only prey on the vulnerable.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.343
Harold did just have
hip replacement surgery.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.504
And Arthur's wife just left him.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.758
- A broken heart.
- That's a kind of vulnerable, I guess.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.052
They hunt the same place
until it's picked clean.

18:14.302 --> 18:15.422
And they only hunt at night,

18:15.511 --> 18:17.354
so that just gives us a few hours
to figure out who's next.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.015
- And how do we kill it?
- Gold blade.

18:19.223 --> 18:22.318
I don't have any in the trunk, so I gotta
head back to the bunker and grab a couple.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.876
You stay here and figure out
who in this place is vulnerable.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.326
Hey!

19:21.911 --> 19:23.163
Cass?

19:25.247 --> 19:26.920
What the hell are you doing, man?

19:28.209 --> 19:29.586
Hello, Dean.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.805
Right, yeah.
We don't hear from you for days,

19:32.922 --> 19:34.602
you show up, you start wrecking the joint?

19:38.052 --> 19:39.395
I'm sorry.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.769
Okay, what, what are you doing?

19:45.059 --> 19:47.778
I'm looking for a spell,
something to draw Amara out.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.780
But there's... There's nothing.

19:50.606 --> 19:54.952
I had her in my sights. She was hurt.
I should have ended it.

19:56.362 --> 19:57.955
Wait, what? How?

20:00.449 --> 20:01.621
Well, I don't know. But...

20:01.992 --> 20:03.414
There has to be something.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.289
And how many more chances
are we gonna get?

20:07.248 --> 20:09.546
Yeah, I know.
Saying you're gonna kill is one thing, but

20:10.418 --> 20:12.298
actually doing it's something
totally different.

20:15.589 --> 20:16.636
What do you mean?

20:18.092 --> 20:19.685
I've had two shots at Amara.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.563
I struck out both times.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.059
What are you talking about?

20:27.893 --> 20:29.213
I don't even know where to start.

20:29.395 --> 20:32.069
Dean, tell me everything.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.247
Come in.

20:40.531 --> 20:44.536
Oh, Agent Butler.
Oh, please, do come in.

20:44.827 --> 20:47.205
- Sure.
- Where's that partner of yours?

20:47.705 --> 20:50.003
Oh, he, um... He'll be back soon.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.762
Is this you?

20:55.171 --> 20:57.014
Yes, that was a long time ago.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.394
Before I got so good looking.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.601
Please, have a seat.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.016
Sure.

21:06.182 --> 21:08.276
- Like some tea?
- Uh, no, thank you.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.060
Ms. Baker...

21:10.644 --> 21:12.646
Mmm. Please, "Mildred."

21:13.022 --> 21:14.069
Mildred.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.734
I need to be honest with you.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.116
My partner and I, we're not really FBI.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.207
We're brothers, and we hunt monsters.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.459
I knew it.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.002
I knew it! I...

21:27.536 --> 21:30.210
You two are too cute to be FBI agents.

21:30.498 --> 21:33.877
And I knew that damn ghost
I saw years ago was real.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.721
Does this, um...

21:38.464 --> 21:39.841
Does this look familiar?

21:41.258 --> 21:43.056
Oh, my God, yes.

21:45.763 --> 21:47.857
- It's a banshee?
- It is-.

21:48.933 --> 21:51.812
Banshees scream at their victims,
getting them to harm themselves.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.570
And then they feed on their...

21:53.729 --> 21:54.901
Brains.

21:55.523 --> 21:59.073
Right. Now, banshees
prey on the vulnerable.

21:59.235 --> 22:02.114
So, I checked out
all of the residents' medical records.

22:02.279 --> 22:06.910
And you have an atrial fibrillation,
which can be treated with meds,

22:07.076 --> 22:09.204
- but it means that...
- I'm vulnerable?

22:12.540 --> 22:13.883
Am I next?

22:14.124 --> 22:15.592
My brother and I
aren't gonna let that happen.

22:15.918 --> 22:18.171
We're gonna protect you. Okay?

22:18.546 --> 22:19.638
Yeah.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.804
Now, banshees only hunt at night.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.594
So, you're safe right now.

22:24.760 --> 22:28.264
And, and we really need you
to try and get some rest while you can.

22:29.265 --> 22:30.482
We'll be back.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.113
One more thing.

22:37.982 --> 22:41.202
Do you know a housekeeper named
Marlene? She's deaf.

22:42.194 --> 22:45.164
I think maybe you got your names mixed up.

22:46.156 --> 22:50.582
There is one person on staff
named Marlene, but she's on vacation.

22:52.496 --> 22:55.750
Agent Butler, my granddaughter is deaf

22:55.916 --> 22:58.795
and I could really use
some practice signing.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.384
So, if there is a staff member
that's deaf,

23:01.547 --> 23:03.470
I would love to talk to them.

23:05.259 --> 23:06.511
So would I.

23:57.353 --> 23:58.400
Hey!

24:12.993 --> 24:16.293
Dressing up as FBI to cover up your kills.

24:17.373 --> 24:18.716
It's almost clever.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.587
Never met a banshee that could blend in.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.846
- Wait, what?
- I read your friend's lips.

24:25.005 --> 24:26.552
It's "feeding time"?

24:26.715 --> 24:28.012
No, no, no. You're mixed up.
You're mixed up.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.222
We're not banshees.

24:29.385 --> 24:32.389
We're hunters. It's my brother.
We're all hunting the same thing here.

24:32.554 --> 24:35.558
A banshee in blood-red robes, right?

24:37.434 --> 24:40.358
I swear. Look, test me. Test me, please.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.076
See?

24:46.151 --> 24:47.152
No.

24:47.695 --> 24:49.789
Hey. Wait a minute.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.499
Thanks.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.335
My name is Sam Winchester.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.212
Eileen Leahy.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.339
The banshee you're hunting?

25:04.753 --> 25:06.676
It killed my parents.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.808
Hold on!

25:25.315 --> 25:28.285
A hunter found me in my crib,
ears bleeding.

25:29.445 --> 25:32.289
Lillian O'Grady. This was hers.

25:32.698 --> 25:36.293
She'd been tracking the banshee.
Never found it, though.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.039
So, Lillian raised you?

25:41.040 --> 25:43.042
More like trained me.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.590
She died when I was 16.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.046
On the job?

25:47.212 --> 25:48.429
Cancer.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.850
And you've been on your own ever since?

25:52.259 --> 25:54.136
I prefer working alone.

25:54.887 --> 25:55.888
Trust issues.

25:56.263 --> 25:57.731
Yeah, I know.

25:59.224 --> 26:01.852
So, was your mom, a hunter or a witch?

26:02.019 --> 26:06.365
No. Her father was part of
this secret organization.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.237
It's defunct now.

26:09.735 --> 26:10.987
The Men of Letters?

26:12.154 --> 26:13.246
Yeah.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.623
How'd you know?

26:16.241 --> 26:20.041
My brother and I, we're like you.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.377
We're legacies.

26:24.124 --> 26:25.341
I tried to kill her.

26:25.501 --> 26:28.755
Well, the two of you are connected
somehow by the Mark.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.137
Yeah, no, it's, it's, uh...
It's more than that.

26:35.052 --> 26:36.429
Attraction?

26:44.686 --> 26:46.029
- Oh, Dean...
- I know.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.115
I know, okay?

26:49.858 --> 26:51.110
Whatever it is, uh,

26:52.277 --> 26:53.904
attraction, connection...

26:54.655 --> 26:56.055
I gotta tell you man, it scares me.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.826
I don't know that I can stop it.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.585
I don't know that I can resist it.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.380
Hey. It scares me, too.

27:03.997 --> 27:06.091
But we will find out
what this is, I promise.

27:06.959 --> 27:10.133
In the end, it may help draw her out.
This could be a good thing.

27:16.552 --> 27:17.553
Sam?

27:17.719 --> 27:19.079
Dean, look up
Edwin Durbin II.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.232
- Wait, what?
- In the Men of Letters files.

27:33.402 --> 27:35.279
Oh, son of a bitch. She ain't lying.

27:35.946 --> 27:37.546
According to the Men of Letters records,

27:37.573 --> 27:40.793
Edwin Durbin ll
was inducted in 1939,

27:40.951 --> 27:42.951
pan' of a small delegation
that was sent to Europe.

27:43.245 --> 27:45.873
Wow. Right.

27:47.958 --> 27:51.258
Yeah. Her father had just lost his job.
He had a nervous breakdown.

27:51.420 --> 27:52.672
- So he was vulnerable.
- Right.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.011
And her mom
only knew some basic spells.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.175
She used one to banish the banshee.

27:56.341 --> 27:57.433
Saved Eileen 's life.

27:57.593 --> 28:01.018
Dean, the banshee we're hunting is the
same one that killed Eileen's parents.

28:01.263 --> 28:04.563
Awesome.
All right, what's the plan?

28:04.725 --> 28:08.070
Well, we're gonna use the same
Celtic spell Eileen used to trap me.

28:08.437 --> 28:10.360
When the banshee comes
for Mildred tonight, we trap it...

28:10.522 --> 28:12.490
- And we hit it with gold.
- Right.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.239
I don't like using Mildred as bait.

28:17.154 --> 28:18.576
Are you worried about her?

28:18.739 --> 28:20.116
So, does this mean she has a shot?

28:21.617 --> 28:23.977
Well, I always did have a thing
for Blanche on Golden Girls.

28:24.161 --> 28:25.162
Seriously?

28:25.370 --> 28:27.748
Hey, don’t judge
what you don't understand, Sammy.

28:27.915 --> 28:31.670
No, I'm, I'm not judging.
I just always had a thing for Sophia.

28:32.252 --> 28:33.299
Yeah, I could see that.

28:34.796 --> 28:36.639
Look, I don't like using anyone as bait.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.641
But this is all we got.

28:38.800 --> 28:39.972
I'm on my way.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.600
Cass, I gotta get back to Sam.

28:42.804 --> 28:46.183
Listen, about what we talked about,
let's just keep that between you and me.

28:46.350 --> 28:47.772
Uh, till we know more. Okay?

28:47.976 --> 28:50.980
- Dean, that's not...
- Cass, just trust me.

28:54.691 --> 28:55.908
All right.

28:56.610 --> 28:59.955
But the next time you face Amara,
you won't be alone.

29:01.657 --> 29:02.783
Thanks, Cass.

29:25.138 --> 29:26.390
Not bad.

29:27.975 --> 29:30.649
All right.
I guess all we have to do now is, uh...

29:30.811 --> 29:31.983
Wait.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.488
Yeah.

29:40.028 --> 29:43.202
Eileen, you okay?

29:45.409 --> 29:46.456
I'm nervous.

29:47.536 --> 29:51.040
If this really is the banshee
I've been looking for...

29:51.290 --> 29:53.543
Eileen, in my experience,

29:54.626 --> 29:56.674
revenge is not all it's cracked up to be.

29:58.046 --> 30:00.720
Killing this banshee
is not gonna bring your parents back.

30:02.759 --> 30:06.229
I never met them.
They're just pictures to me.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.897
But... They're family.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.153
My family.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.397
I understand. Believe me.

30:16.273 --> 30:18.742
But after you get your revenge,

30:19.234 --> 30:20.406
then what?

30:22.404 --> 30:25.032
I have no idea.

30:27.034 --> 30:28.911
My mother was a lawyer.

30:29.453 --> 30:31.547
Be nice to follow in her footsteps.

30:32.414 --> 30:35.759
I was studying law at Stanford
when my brother came and got me,

30:35.917 --> 30:37.339
so we could get our revenge.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.965
You've been hunting together ever since?

30:41.131 --> 30:44.101
Yeah. I, I wouldn't do this
without my brother.

30:45.886 --> 30:47.729
He's had my back every step of the way.

30:49.473 --> 30:50.770
Even when I let him down.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.526
Hey.

30:57.773 --> 31:00.447
Eileen, this is my brother,
Dean Winchester.

31:00.650 --> 31:02.152
Dean, this is Eileen Leahy.

31:02.319 --> 31:04.242
Eileen, it's good to meet you.

31:04.946 --> 31:06.948
So, you're, uh, a legacy, too?

31:07.157 --> 31:08.784
I guess so, yeah.

31:10.118 --> 31:13.042
Uh, right, well, uh... Let's see here.

31:14.790 --> 31:17.634
There's one for you.
And I'm guessing you already have one.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.713
Uh, I guess we got an extra one
for Mildred. Where's Mildred?

31:23.173 --> 31:24.390
Agent!

31:25.300 --> 31:27.473
- Oh, I'm glad you're back.
- Yeah.

31:27.636 --> 31:30.185
- I feel safer already. Um...
- Yeah.

31:30.972 --> 31:32.645
Come here. I want to show you something.

31:41.525 --> 31:44.620
Well, come on and sit down.
I'm not gonna bite.

31:44.778 --> 31:46.371
Never really was my thing.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.459
Okay.

31:51.993 --> 31:54.587
I have the same view from upstairs.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.669
West-facing rooms, they cost extra.

31:56.832 --> 31:58.675
You know, you gotta pay for the view.

31:59.376 --> 32:00.844
- Mmm.
- It's not bad.

32:01.837 --> 32:02.929
"Not bad"?

32:03.755 --> 32:06.679
Honey, it's almost as gorgeous as you are.

32:09.219 --> 32:10.687
You know, tell me something.

32:11.138 --> 32:13.266
When's the last time you watched a sunset

32:13.682 --> 32:16.606
without waiting for something
to go bump in the night?

32:19.396 --> 32:20.397
Hmm.

32:21.398 --> 32:23.742
- You should try it sometime.
- Yeah.

32:25.152 --> 32:28.031
I just hope...
This one isn't my last.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.582
I mean, does this stuff really work?

32:32.367 --> 32:37.749
A banshee shows up and you cut your hand
and slap it on one of those things,

32:37.914 --> 32:39.006
and it gets trapped?

32:39.166 --> 32:42.010
I mean, this is actually
something that happens?

32:42.169 --> 32:45.594
Yep. And then it gets one of these.

32:47.674 --> 32:50.393
Mildred, everything's gonna be fine.

32:51.887 --> 32:52.979
Okay?

32:55.140 --> 32:58.314
Tell me something.
What'd you do before you retired?

33:00.812 --> 33:03.565
I was in a Patsy Cline tribute band.

33:03.732 --> 33:06.076
- No.
- I am deadly serious.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.910
- You ever miss life on the road?
- Ah!

33:11.573 --> 33:13.371
Nah, I had my fun.

33:16.453 --> 33:20.299
You wanna know the secret to living
a long and happy life?

33:21.416 --> 33:23.168
Actually, yes, I do.

33:24.461 --> 33:25.587
Follow your heart.

33:27.464 --> 33:31.435
You do that,
all the rest just figures itself out.

33:33.595 --> 33:35.188
I did that.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.312
I followed my heart.

33:37.474 --> 33:41.775
Travelled the world, made people smile,

33:41.937 --> 33:43.610
forget about their problems for a while.

33:43.772 --> 33:46.150
And then my heart said,
"Well, you're done."

33:46.399 --> 33:47.742
I had my fill and...

33:48.985 --> 33:52.114
And I retired. And I love it.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.951
Hey, you know,
this place isn't what I expected.

33:56.117 --> 34:00.213
Oh, life here is great.
I'd just like to enjoy it a little more.

34:00.455 --> 34:03.129
And you will. I promise.

34:07.212 --> 34:09.840
Your hand is still on my knee.

34:12.425 --> 34:13.641
I could move it up.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.679
Okay.

34:16.304 --> 34:18.523
I'm gonna...

34:21.476 --> 34:22.728
Do you hear that?

34:24.771 --> 34:26.899
I don't hear anything. Do you?

34:27.232 --> 34:28.324
Sam!

34:30.819 --> 34:31.945
Dean!

34:33.572 --> 34:36.166
- Oh, Sam, it's what happened to Arthur!
- Hey! Hey!

34:37.284 --> 34:38.331
Dean.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.166
Dean, look at me!

34:50.338 --> 34:52.011
Sam, it's here!

35:04.644 --> 35:05.861
Eileen!

35:19.743 --> 35:22.166
- Mildred!
- Stop! Stop!

35:50.857 --> 35:51.858
Oh.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.277
Are you okay?

35:56.237 --> 35:57.363
Hey.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.505
Thank you.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.597
So, how do you feel?

36:14.255 --> 36:17.725
It felt like just another kill.

36:19.260 --> 36:21.012
It didn't bring my parents back.

36:21.805 --> 36:22.806
Nothing will.

36:24.307 --> 36:26.105
What now? Law school?

36:27.519 --> 36:29.897
No. This is my life.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.862
Feel free to drop a line
if you ever need anything.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.864
Or even if you just want to hang out.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.869
- You can't call me, though.
-  Okay.

36:40.031 --> 36:42.250
I mean, you could call,
but I won't answer.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.625
So, you boys hitting the road, huh?

36:45.787 --> 36:47.130
Yes, ma'am.

36:47.455 --> 36:51.301
Well, it's for the best. It wouldn't have
worked out between us, anyway.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.128
Why not?

36:54.546 --> 37:00.269
Darling, if there is one thing
I've learned in all my years on the road,

37:00.468 --> 37:03.142
it's when somebody's pining
for somebody else.

37:04.305 --> 37:06.808
Oh, don't try and hide it, now.

37:07.642 --> 37:10.065
Follow your heart. Remember?

37:12.105 --> 37:14.574
I don't know who the lucky lady is,

37:14.858 --> 37:16.826
but I'm damn sure jealous.

37:17.777 --> 37:20.826
Well, I am single,
and I am ready to mingle. So...

37:20.989 --> 37:23.538
Well, then you know where I live.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.754
All right. You boys stay out of trouble.

37:28.037 --> 37:30.460
That's not gonna happen, Mildred.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.691
Wow!

38:09.537 --> 38:10.880
- Cass gone?
- Yeah, I guess so.

38:11.623 --> 38:12.875
What was he doing here, anyway?

38:13.041 --> 38:14.641
He was looking for lore on the Darkness.

38:16.836 --> 38:18.716
There was something
a little off about him, too.

38:19.255 --> 38:22.429
Something always seems
a little bit off about Cass.

38:24.010 --> 38:26.854
Ah, you know, being so close to Lucifer
probably wasn't easy for him, either.

38:27.013 --> 38:28.560
We'll just keep an eye on him.

38:31.601 --> 38:33.569
You were right, by the way.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.899
Getting back on the job. It... It helped.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.740
Wait, say that again?
That part about me being right.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.913
You're an idiot.

38:45.073 --> 38:46.199
Dean.

38:46.908 --> 38:48.910
When I was with Lucifer, he, um...

38:51.204 --> 38:52.421
He showed me things.

38:53.206 --> 38:56.130
It was like a highlight reel
of my biggest failures.

38:56.376 --> 38:58.128
Yeah, he was messing with you.
That's what he does.

38:58.294 --> 38:59.591
Give me a sec.

39:03.716 --> 39:04.933
I should've looked for you.

39:06.553 --> 39:08.021
When you were in Purgatory, I...

39:09.430 --> 39:11.057
I should have turned over every stone.

39:12.100 --> 39:14.444
But I didn't. I stopped.

39:16.938 --> 39:18.781
And I've never forgiven myself for it.

39:21.276 --> 39:23.529
Well, I have.

39:25.780 --> 39:28.158
Hey, that's in the past, man.

39:29.242 --> 39:30.869
What's done is done.

39:31.077 --> 39:33.921
All that matters now,
all that's ever mattered,

39:34.122 --> 39:37.422
is that we're together.
So, shut up and drink your beer.

39:41.796 --> 39:43.798
Ah. You gonna be able to sleep tonight?

39:44.841 --> 39:48.186
Yeah. Yeah, I think so. What about you?

39:48.344 --> 39:50.344
Yeah, I still got some ringing
going on in my head,

39:51.055 --> 39:52.978
but nothing some good music
can't wash out.

39:58.313 --> 39:59.610
You know...

40:00.732 --> 40:01.932
I still can't figure that out.

40:01.983 --> 40:05.487
I mean, banshees
go after the vulnerable, right?

40:06.529 --> 40:07.906
So, Why'd it go after you?

40:10.158 --> 40:11.330
You're overthinking it.

40:11.868 --> 40:13.996
It was going after Mildred,
it saw my gold blade,

40:14.162 --> 40:16.164
acted out of self-defense. Simple.

40:20.168 --> 40:22.637
Yeah. You're probably right.

40:22.962 --> 40:24.339
- I'm always right.
- Yeah, yeah.

40:24.505 --> 40:25.882
- Night.
- Night.
