[Alex] <i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> Light As a Feather...

00:04.505 --> 00:06.423
What the hell is that?

00:06.423 --> 00:07.424
Everyone's so concerned
about you and these pills,

00:07.424 --> 00:08.675
and then there's Jennie,

00:08.675 --> 00:10.511
who died of a heart attack

00:10.511 --> 00:12.971
‐triggered by drugs.
‐What do you want?

00:12.971 --> 00:14.765
We have to play
Light As A Feather again‐‐

00:14.765 --> 00:16.808
you, me, McKenna, and Candace.
Help convince them.

00:16.808 --> 00:20.395
[Mr. Morris]
Your new Senior Class President
is Violet Simmons!

00:20.395 --> 00:22.606
[Candace] I'm gonna prove
that you killed Olivia.

00:22.606 --> 00:23.815
You might be next.

00:23.815 --> 00:24.816
She just threatened me!

00:24.816 --> 00:26.235
No, you're a psycho!

00:26.235 --> 00:28.195
She's crazy,
and she killed Olivia!

00:28.195 --> 00:29.529
[Mr. Morris]
Get her out! Get her out!

00:29.529 --> 00:30.530
[Candace]
What is this? Where am I?

00:30.530 --> 00:31.823
The Daybridge Center.

00:31.823 --> 00:33.492
You're going to get better here.

00:33.492 --> 00:34.701
The doctor will be in shortly.

00:34.701 --> 00:35.911
Wait! Doctor?!

00:44.378 --> 00:47.047
[soft crunching sound]

[ear ringing]

00:58.100 --> 00:59.601
[gasping]

01:08.777 --> 01:11.446
[Violet] You haven't been
answering my texts, Alex.

01:11.446 --> 01:14.741
I know.
I'm sorry, it's just‐‐

01:14.741 --> 01:16.285
McKenna and those guys
are on to you already.

01:16.285 --> 01:17.828
How am I supposed
to convince her

01:17.828 --> 01:19.162
to play Light as a Feather
with you again?

01:19.162 --> 01:21.748
Figure something out.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.041
Lie or something.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.167
You're good at that, right?

01:25.210 --> 01:27.045
Look, you have until tomorrow.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.880
After that,
I'm gonna have to have

01:28.880 --> 01:31.300
a really awkward conversation
with McKenna about pills.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.432
[Henry] <i>I looked up</i>
<i>the names Lena gave us,</i>

01:38.432 --> 01:40.183
and everything checks out.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.852
They all went to Kinney School
with Marc and Violet,

01:41.852 --> 01:43.645
and now they're dead‐‐

01:43.645 --> 01:47.190
food allergy, suicide,
hit by a car.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.567
That's it then.

01:48.567 --> 01:49.943
We can't
just sit around any longer.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.403
We have to go there tonight.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.071
Go where?

01:53.071 --> 01:55.032
Uh, to Violet's.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.616
I told them about the journal

01:56.616 --> 01:58.410
I found when I slept over,

01:58.410 --> 01:59.995
and they think we could find
something useful in it.

01:59.995 --> 02:02.497
Wait, no, guys,
she's dangerous.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.416
We can't just break
into her house.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.043
What if she catches us?

02:06.043 --> 02:07.836
Alex, you almost died
yesterday.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.796
We can't waste
any more time.

02:09.796 --> 02:12.549
Violet's gonna be tied up
with Olivia's tree dedication.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.259
You guys can go
to her house then,

02:14.259 --> 02:16.428
and Alex and I
will keep an eye on her.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.013
[Henry] Makes sense.

02:18.013 --> 02:20.557
[Trey]
Fine. Tomorrow.

02:20.557 --> 02:24.853
Okay, this is gonna sound crazy,
but, um, I was just thinking,

02:24.853 --> 02:28.315
and all of this is happening
because of the game,

02:28.315 --> 02:32.110
so maybe if we play the game
again with Violet,

02:32.110 --> 02:34.196
we can figure out
what's going on.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.241
You're right.
That sounds absolutely crazy.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.410
I'm just saying,
we might get more information

02:40.410 --> 02:42.996
out of the actual game
than just some journal.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.290
Olivia died
playing that game.

02:45.290 --> 02:48.210
There's no way
we're going near that again.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.128
I know.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.673
Right. Dumb plan.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.634
Are you okay?

02:55.634 --> 02:56.760
You look kind of pale.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.969
I'm fine.

02:57.969 --> 03:00.555
Just didn't get much sleep.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.391
I'll see you guys inside.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.711
[muffled]
How are you feeling, Alex?

03:31.711 --> 03:35.841
Like I just got trampled
by a marching band.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.509
What happened?

03:37.509 --> 03:39.886
You fainted
in the parking lot.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.596
I need to ask,

03:41.596 --> 03:43.890
when's the last time
you ate something?

03:43.890 --> 03:46.393
I'm not sure. Why?

03:46.393 --> 03:49.646
Your blood pressure's low,
your heart rhythm is irregular,

03:49.646 --> 03:51.690
and you're severely dehydrated.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.567
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

03:55.235 --> 03:58.738
No. I just haven't been
taking good care of myself

03:58.738 --> 04:00.740
since, you know.

04:00.740 --> 04:04.161
But I'm fine, really.

04:04.161 --> 04:06.163
Well, I talked to your parents,

04:06.163 --> 04:07.789
and, given your history,

04:07.789 --> 04:09.291
I'm gonna need
to give you a drug test.

04:09.291 --> 04:12.544
Wait. No.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.921
I haven't
been taking anything, I swear.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.840
You can use
the bathroom over there.

04:19.551 --> 04:20.677

04:30.395 --> 04:31.813
Hey.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.398
Hey.

04:33.398 --> 04:34.441
Thanks.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.988
[McKenna]
Al,

04:39.988 --> 04:42.199
I need you to tell me the truth.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.868
Have you been using again?

04:44.868 --> 04:47.454
No, I swear.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.706
I just haven't
been eating anything.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.335
What do you want me to do?

04:53.335 --> 04:55.962
Every time I open my mouth,
I think I'm gonna choke.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.423
I can't eat, I can't sleep,
I can't drink.

04:59.549 --> 05:00.592
Look...

05:02.052 --> 05:04.596
I know that
I was upset about the pills,

05:04.596 --> 05:08.099
but you know it's just
because I was worried, right?

05:08.099 --> 05:11.770
I can't lose you too, Alex.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.689
And we're gonna get
through this together,

05:14.689 --> 05:16.525
I promise.

05:17.859 --> 05:20.195
No.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.614
No, it's all my fault.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.616
I thought I could make it right,

05:24.616 --> 05:27.160
‐but I just made
everything worse.
‐[phone buzzing]

05:27.160 --> 05:28.787

05:28.787 --> 05:29.996
Mack, I have
to tell you something.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.289
Oh, my God.
It's Candace.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.709
Candace, hey, are you okay?

05:34.709 --> 05:37.212
We've been trying
to call you for days.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.922
Yeah, Alex is with me.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.509
Wait, you mean right now?

05:46.388 --> 05:48.598
[McKenna]
<i>Hey, um, I was thinking,</i>

05:48.598 --> 05:50.976
I don't think we should tell
Candace about Isaac.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.519
I don't know.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.521
I mean,
they were together, right?

05:54.521 --> 05:55.939
Wouldn't she want to know?

05:55.939 --> 05:57.566
I know, but I just‐‐

05:57.566 --> 05:58.942
I don't think she's
gonna take it well,

05:58.942 --> 06:00.193
and we don't want
to give them

06:00.193 --> 06:01.444
another reason
to keep her here.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.154
[door opens]

06:04.531 --> 06:06.825
‐Oh, my God, Candace!
‐Hey.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.244
We're so happy you called.
We were so worried.

06:09.244 --> 06:11.746
Guys, thanks. I'm fine.

06:11.746 --> 06:12.873
Really.

06:12.873 --> 06:13.999
Are they treating you okay?

06:13.999 --> 06:15.208
When can you get out of here?

06:15.208 --> 06:16.209
Everyone's great.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.838
Come on, I can show you around.

06:22.883 --> 06:27.304
Back there is the group therapy
and the relaxation room.

06:27.304 --> 06:31.725
And this here's where we do yoga
and group meditation classes.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.935
I start
a new class next week.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.770
And my room is here.

06:38.440 --> 06:42.027
[Alex]
Wait, next week?

06:42.027 --> 06:45.405
How long are you planning
on staying here?

06:45.405 --> 06:48.909
I don't know.
As long as I need to.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.744
Candace, are you okay?

06:50.744 --> 06:53.622
Yeah, why?

06:53.622 --> 06:55.165
Last time we saw you,

06:55.165 --> 06:56.833
you were trying to punch
Violet in the throat.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.003
Now you're in some rando
therapy center doing yoga.

07:00.003 --> 07:02.547
What's going on?

07:02.547 --> 07:04.924
I needed help.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.761
Great, I get that. But we
really need your help, too.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.679
We've been doing
a lot of digging on Violet.

07:09.679 --> 07:10.847
No, no, stop.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.223
There have been a lot of people

07:12.223 --> 07:13.642
who've played
this game with her,

07:13.642 --> 07:15.060
‐and they're all dead!
‐Stop!

07:16.603 --> 07:20.982
Look, this obsession
with the game and Violet,

07:20.982 --> 07:22.192
you guys need to let it go.

07:22.192 --> 07:23.860
We can't just let it go,
Candace.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.487
What have they been
telling you here?

07:25.487 --> 07:27.614
Violet killed Olivia,

07:27.614 --> 07:29.074
and now she's
coming after all of us.

07:29.074 --> 07:31.284
No, she isn't.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.871
Look, I know when Olivia died,
we were all spiraling,

07:34.871 --> 07:36.706
looking for someone to blame.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.959
But that night
when I attacked Violet,

07:41.461 --> 07:43.171
I couldn't
even recognize myself.

07:45.507 --> 07:47.926
Okay, so what are you saying?

07:50.387 --> 07:54.182
I'm saying
this place is helping me.

07:55.600 --> 07:59.187
And if you guys
can't understand that,

07:59.187 --> 08:00.355
you just need to leave.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.196
I don't know what's
going on in that place,

08:08.196 --> 08:09.489
but we have got
to get her out of there.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.990
[Alex] It's Violet.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.492
She must have gotten
to Candace somehow.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.077
She's after all of us.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.663
Mack, wait,
I need to tell you something.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.957
What? Whatever it is,
I'm sure it's fine.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.875
No, you don't understand.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.591
I'm the one that gave
the pills to Jennie.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.719
She‐‐ She knew
I started taking them

08:30.719 --> 08:32.637
when I joined the dance team.

08:32.637 --> 08:35.432
She had three finals coming up,
and she was so stressed out.

08:35.432 --> 08:38.101
I knew you and Jennie had
something wrong with your heart,

08:38.101 --> 08:40.311
but I had no idea
how bad it was.

08:40.311 --> 08:43.231
And she just kept asking me.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.316
And I know it's no excuse.

08:45.316 --> 08:48.236
And I never should have
hid it from you.

08:48.236 --> 08:51.823
But I was so scared
that you would hate me.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.158
[sobbing] I'm sorry.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.994
Why are you
telling me this now?

08:55.994 --> 08:57.495
Violet. She found out,

08:57.495 --> 08:59.247
and she threatened
to tell you unless...

08:59.247 --> 09:01.124
Unless we played
the game with her again.

09:02.584 --> 09:04.794
I'm so sorry, Mack.

09:04.794 --> 09:08.256
I was so worried
about having you hate me

09:08.256 --> 09:10.842
that I wasn't thinking straight.

09:10.842 --> 09:13.887
But after what she did
to Candace,

09:13.887 --> 09:16.222
I'd rather have you hate me
than put you in danger.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.099
Right.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.852
Like how you put Jennie
in danger.

09:23.605 --> 09:24.981

No, Trey,

11:51.336 --> 11:52.837

11:52.837 --> 11:55.298
I should have believed you.

I just don't understand
why you're still here
after everything.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.387
You should hate me.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.348
I could never hate you.

12:03.348 --> 12:06.559

tell you this now,

12:09.646 --> 12:11.272
I might never get the chance.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.649

12:14.317 --> 12:15.735

how Jennie used to save

12:15.735 --> 12:17.570
every note we ever passed?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.489
‐Yeah.
‐The last time I was here,

12:19.489 --> 12:21.032

12:27.538 --> 12:29.332

a date for the dance yet?"

"Who knows? Why are you
bothering me about it?"

12:50.186 --> 12:51.854

12:51.854 --> 12:53.690

12:53.690 --> 12:56.734

and tell her you...

Thanks to all your generous
GoFundMe contributions,

13:49.495 --> 13:51.873

Olivia's memory alive

13:51.873 --> 13:54.417

that she loved most:

13:54.417 --> 13:56.753

13:56.753 --> 14:00.006
Henry, will you do the honors?

14:04.552 --> 14:05.762
Hey.

14:08.556 --> 14:11.476
You're wearing
Olivia's bracelet.

14:11.476 --> 14:15.354
Yeah, uh, her mom gave it
to me after‐‐

14:17.440 --> 14:19.400
I'm sorry, Alex. I can't.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.488
Fine. I get it.

14:23.488 --> 14:24.947
Do you?

14:24.947 --> 14:27.325
Why are you
even standing here?

14:27.325 --> 14:29.911
I don't know.
Because I'm sorry.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.081
Look, this is what Violet wants.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.583
For us to fight
and turn against each other.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.002
It's part of her game.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.880
And right now,
we really need each other, Mack.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.507
Right?

14:42.507 --> 14:43.716
We're in this together.

14:43.716 --> 14:47.178
No, we're not.

14:47.178 --> 14:49.597
It's not just
what you did to Jennie.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.683
You lied to me.
For years.

14:52.683 --> 14:56.270
And then you almost walked me
into a trap with Violet,

14:56.270 --> 14:58.689
all because you couldn't
tell the truth.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.566
So, yeah, I'm having
a pretty difficult time

15:00.566 --> 15:02.443

15:02.443 --> 15:04.570
Okay, then tell me what
I need to do to make it better.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.197
You can't.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.503
Trey, we need to talk
about what happened last night.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.463
Oh, okay.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.423
Is it because
of you and Henry?

15:24.423 --> 15:26.008
No.

15:26.008 --> 15:29.512
I‐‐ I mean, yeah,
I do need to sort that out.

15:29.512 --> 15:33.432
But there's a lot of other stuff
going on right now, Trey.

15:33.432 --> 15:36.185
I get it. I'm sorry.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.062
Take as much time as you need.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.189
‐I can wait.
‐Thank you.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.776

15:43.776 --> 15:45.528
Yeah, let's go.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.864
I'll text you
when we get to Violet's.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.949
Okay. I'll make sure
she doesn't leave.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.033

will the cops come,

broken into a house before.

I'd say so, yeah.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.622

Wow. I'm gonna keep looking.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.302

for the Daybridge Center

Candace is getting.

paid for the whole thing?

18:04.333 --> 18:05.751
No.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.004
[Trey] Yeah, and this shit
is expensive, too.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.839
I mean, they're doing all
this crazy water treatment,

18:09.839 --> 18:12.091

for Candace's treatment?
