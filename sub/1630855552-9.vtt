my daughter a joint, huh?

23:40.285 --> 23:43.726
Mm, we were friends,
me and your mom.

23:43.826 --> 23:45.596
I mean, uh, I don't think

23:45.696 --> 23:49.504
I could remember the first,
you know, moment I met her.

23:49.604 --> 23:51.273
We partied together back then.

You know, that was
before I quit drinking.

23:53.646 --> 23:56.083

ran with that whole crowd.

You know, that's how we met.

24:06.103 --> 24:07.807
Oh, it's okay.

24:07.907 --> 24:10.746
No, we were probably together
only four months

24:10.846 --> 24:12.984
when she told me
that she was pregnant.

24:13.084 --> 24:16.991
I mean, we... we were not great
together, your mom and me.

24:17.091 --> 24:19.998
I mean... I mean, I was-I was...
I was crazy about her.

24:20.098 --> 24:21.468
Really crazy. Like, too crazy.

24:21.568 --> 24:23.772
I probably would've
gotten sick of me, too.

24:23.872 --> 24:27.078
It's just,
we fought all the time.

24:27.179 --> 24:29.082
We were...

24:29.182 --> 24:30.586
We were so young.
I mean, fuck.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.924
We had no business
having a baby.

24:33.892 --> 24:36.732
I mean, that's-that's not...
that's not an excuse.

24:36.832 --> 24:38.267
I was too young.

24:38.367 --> 24:40.605
I should have tried
a lot harder.

I don't know.

to a pancake.

pretty fucked-up

25:35.515 --> 25:40.493
Uh... I could offer you,
like, a hundred reasons,

25:40.593 --> 25:43.097
but it... it doesn't matter.

I'm not a perfect person.

you have to be perfect. It's...

I'm not saying that.

No, and-and nobody
has accused me of that.

It's just-just...

25:53.151 --> 25:55.355
I don't know. Here-here I am,
and I got these new kids.

that you were there. I-I...

I just... I don't understand

26:04.507 --> 26:06.277
why I didn't just go down there

26:06.377 --> 26:08.414
and knock on your door
like you did.

26:08.515 --> 26:10.853
I mean, I could have done this
a lot earlier.

26:10.953 --> 26:14.359

so stupid and weak.

-Yup.
-I don't...

in school?

26:43.485 --> 26:46.023
-You know?
-Dropped out.

26:46.123 --> 26:48.026
Oh, wow. Like me.

26:48.127 --> 26:50.398
You, uh... you play any sports?

26:50.499 --> 26:53.505
I used to play basketball
and then I quit.

26:53.605 --> 26:55.909
Oh, yeah?
Who-who was your coach--

26:56.009 --> 26:57.245
was it Bobson?

-Yeah.
-Oh!

26:59.082 --> 27:00.185

I mean...

27:05.061 --> 27:07.232

27:07.332 --> 27:09.035

I mean, I don't see you
dunking anytime soon.

27:13.478 --> 27:15.715
I was point guard.

27:15.815 --> 27:18.622
I got some points and then
I cussed Bobson out and quit.

27:18.722 --> 27:21.727
I like that. Does he still have
that crazy red mane of hair?

27:23.598 --> 27:24.967
Hardly. He's pretty bald now.

27:25.068 --> 27:26.705

a full head of hair, huh?

27:26.805 --> 27:28.340
I mean, I got that going for me.

27:29.142 --> 27:30.712
Right.

27:33.150 --> 27:35.522
Where are you staying now?

27:37.292 --> 27:40.398
At my... at my grandma's.

27:40.499 --> 27:42.503
I got the house
after she passed.

27:44.105 --> 27:47.378
Oh, I-I didn't...
I didn't know that she passed.

Uh, I'm sorry.

-Yeah.
-You know, it's another thing.

27:51.922 --> 27:56.062
I don't know if this is
a-a cop-out, or... I just...

27:56.163 --> 27:58.034
I didn't want
to take you away from all that.

27:58.134 --> 28:01.641
You know, I didn't want to take
you away from your family,

28:01.741 --> 28:04.613
from your people. I...

28:06.250 --> 28:08.621
And-and I was a coward.

28:10.057 --> 28:12.094
It was a cop-out.

28:13.097 --> 28:14.767
Yeah?

28:18.641 --> 28:20.546

you know,

28:20.646 --> 28:22.415

28:24.319 --> 28:26.223

28:26.323 --> 28:28.361

28:28.462 --> 28:30.599
And I decided to honor that.

28:30.699 --> 28:32.903
I didn't even go to the funeral.

28:34.306 --> 28:37.646
Just sat at home and cried.

28:42.790 --> 28:45.027
And you were relieved?

28:46.130 --> 28:48.367
Relieved?

28:49.637 --> 28:51.574

28:51.674 --> 28:54.513

28:59.155 --> 29:00.625
Yes.
