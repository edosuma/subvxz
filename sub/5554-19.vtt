WEBVTT

00:03.270 --> 00:08.007
The 2016 ScorpiOlympics
has been a nail-biter.

00:08.009 --> 00:10.009
And next up is
the Brain-Freeze Slalom,

00:10.011 --> 00:12.144
in which these finely tuned
mathletes

00:12.146 --> 00:14.480
chug 44-ounce
Coldee Freezees

00:14.482 --> 00:18.183
and attempt to solve
the Viennese binomial theorem,

00:18.185 --> 00:19.685
whatever that is.

00:19.687 --> 00:20.586
(blows whistle)

00:20.588 --> 00:23.088
And they're off!

00:26.093 --> 00:28.193
Toby takes an early lead,

00:28.195 --> 00:30.195
Happy just on his tail.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.531
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Sly is just really struggling

00:32.533 --> 00:34.466
from a major, major
brain freeze.

00:34.468 --> 00:35.734
That must be painful.

00:38.272 --> 00:41.040
Oh! And in a stunning upset,

00:41.042 --> 00:43.342
Dr. Curtis steals the gold

00:43.344 --> 00:47.246
in a category Sly Dodd
should've run away with.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.081
These drinks are
6.4 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.516
Given the speed

00:50.518 --> 00:53.152
pain receptors send signals
to the trigeminal nerve,

00:53.154 --> 00:56.255
not having a physical reaction
is impossible!

00:57.224 --> 00:58.791
What's this?

00:58.793 --> 01:00.793
He coated his mouth
with almond butter

01:00.795 --> 01:02.261
to reduce
the capillary constriction.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.463
RALPH: Performance-enhancing
nut butters

01:04.465 --> 01:05.597
aren't allowed.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.733
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.769
Okay, disqualified
for shenanigans.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.804
I already gave up gambling. If
I give up cheating, what's left?

01:12.740 --> 01:15.307
Cheaters never prosper.
Why are you

01:15.309 --> 01:16.642
so ornery today?

01:16.644 --> 01:18.277
What, did you get
more rejection letters?

01:19.213 --> 01:21.080
Three of my last four options.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.816
No game show in the U.S.
or Mexico will have me

01:23.818 --> 01:25.651
since I crushed it
on<i> The Price Is Right,</i>

01:25.653 --> 01:27.586
which, by the way, is the
only show with integrity.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.321
WALTER:
Can you please keep it down?

01:29.323 --> 01:31.256
Your games are interrupting
my research.

01:31.258 --> 01:34.093
Taking gold in Freestyle
Buzzkill, Walter O'Brien.

01:34.095 --> 01:35.794
Want to join our Olympics?

01:35.796 --> 01:37.463
No, I take issue
with the Olympics.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.099
They started in 776 BC.

01:40.101 --> 01:42.101
And with an average duration
of three weeks

01:42.103 --> 01:45.170
and 5,000 athletes per Games,
that is one...

01:45.172 --> 01:47.106
134 million man-hours.

01:47.108 --> 01:48.641
Exactly.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.175
Think about all the progress
that we could've made

01:50.177 --> 01:52.244
if the ancient Greeks
had done work instead

01:52.246 --> 01:55.280
of seeing who could throw
heavy objects the furthest.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.648
Least they could throw.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.784
Maybe you're against playing
'cause you have a rag arm.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.786
That's false.

02:00.788 --> 02:01.887
Think you can win,

02:01.889 --> 02:03.889
197? Prove it.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.357
PAIGE:
Oh.

02:05.359 --> 02:07.326
A new turn of events

02:07.328 --> 02:09.194
for the ScorpiOlympics.

02:09.196 --> 02:13.332
Walter O'Brien calculates
weight, distance,

02:13.334 --> 02:16.201
aerodynamics, and...

02:16.203 --> 02:17.269
throws!

02:17.271 --> 02:18.904
Oh.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.706
(Sylvester cries out)

02:20.708 --> 02:22.307
Yeah, the beans
shifted in the bag,

02:22.309 --> 02:23.509
throwing off the trajectory.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.711
Bag's not the only thing
full of beans.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.146
HAPPY:
O'Brien, heads up.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.158
I need to buy a new lens
for my microscope.

02:44.231 --> 02:46.732
That guy doesn't respect
the game.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.770
(phone beeps)
Call Know-It-All.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.572
FEMALE VOICE:
Calling Know-It-All.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.408
(phone rings)

02:56.410 --> 02:58.477
Let me guess,
you want a rematch.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.746
You need to turn
the Bunsen burner off in my lab.

03:00.748 --> 03:04.316
Okay. You've been buried
in that lab for weeks now.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.717
Want to know why?
Nope.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.320
'Cause dating blew up
in your face

03:08.322 --> 03:10.422
and you're retreating
to your comfort zone, work.

03:10.424 --> 03:13.559
Listen, would you just please
shut it off for me.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.761
Thank you.
(phone beeps off)

03:17.198 --> 03:19.765
(tires screech)

03:20.734 --> 03:23.669
Mr. O'Brien.

03:23.671 --> 03:26.205
Yes.
Doctor's still behind.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.306
You'll be seen
shortly.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.408
You know, I'm really fine.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.677
I'm sure you are,
but you were in an accident.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.545
We got to do a full CT workup,
all right?

03:33.547 --> 03:35.280
So just hold tight.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.686
How's it goin'?

03:42.256 --> 03:43.655
Head injury, huh?

03:43.657 --> 03:45.007
Apparently.

03:45.008 --> 03:46.358
Are you experiencing
double vision?

03:46.360 --> 03:47.693
Ringing in your ears?

03:47.695 --> 03:49.294
No.
No.

03:49.296 --> 03:50.896
Vertigo? Nausea?

03:50.898 --> 03:54.433
Neck pain? TMJ?
No, Doctor,

03:54.435 --> 03:57.269
I'm-I'm fine. I'd just...
I-I would really like to go.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.271
(chuckles)
Uh, I, actually...

03:59.273 --> 04:01.607
Uh, I'm not a doctor.

04:01.609 --> 04:04.343
But many people think I'm a
doctor because I wear this coat.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.511
But, you know,
I just like to wear white.

04:06.513 --> 04:08.747
And the California Bar
ruled that, uh,

04:08.749 --> 04:10.983
I'm allowed to wear it in here.

04:13.621 --> 04:16.355
You're a lawyer.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.956
Yes.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.925
That's my card.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.893
And since you've identified me
as an attorney on your own

04:21.895 --> 04:23.795
and told me you're feeling okay,

04:23.797 --> 04:25.464
I'm allowed to give you that
without violating

04:25.466 --> 04:26.932
any solicitation rules.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.268
Heywood Ja-help-em?

04:29.270 --> 04:31.637
Ja-help...
That's a unique middle name.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.306
Actually, it's pronounced,
uh, Ja-help-me,

04:34.308 --> 04:37.009
as in, "Hey, Would Ya Help Me?"

04:37.011 --> 04:38.727
(chuckles)

04:38.728 --> 04:40.444
I had it legally changed
for business purposes.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.748
Back of your card looks
like a $20 bill.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.016
It's cool, right?

04:44.018 --> 04:45.684
Yeah, that's so
if people throw 'em away,

04:45.686 --> 04:47.352
you know, other folks
will come by and be like,

04:47.354 --> 04:48.854
"Oh, cool, $20."
They'll pick 'em up

04:48.856 --> 04:50.455
and then they'll be like,
"Oh, it's a lawyer."

04:50.457 --> 04:53.392
And then they'll...
A lot of people throw 'em away.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.394
NURSE: Heywood, we've
told you we don't want you

04:55.396 --> 04:57.663
hanging around the ER. Bernice,
we're having a conversation here.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.999
Counting to three, I'm calling
the Bar Association. One...

05:01.001 --> 05:02.434
Uncool, Bernice.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.837
...two...
Uh, in any case,

05:05.839 --> 05:07.072
I'm really glad
you're feeling better.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.373
But if you feel
a turn,

05:08.375 --> 05:10.375
Heywood Jahelpme...

05:10.377 --> 05:12.744
by giving me a call
and letting me be your lawyer?

05:12.746 --> 05:14.913
Oh. Um...

05:14.915 --> 05:16.481
Yeah, sure.

05:16.483 --> 05:19.384
(chuckles)
Oh, okay. Great.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.019
Cool.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.355
(nurse hangs up receiver)

05:24.391 --> 05:25.757
Hi. I'm Jennifer Pearson.

05:25.759 --> 05:28.093
I-I got a call.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.095
We're here for my daughter
Olivia's heart transplant.

05:30.097 --> 05:33.598
We've been expecting you. Since
you were moved up on the list,

05:33.600 --> 05:35.100
there's a few more
forms to sign.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.836
Olivia, if you just want to have
a seat, we'll be right with you.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.505
Um, you want to go sit right there?
Okay.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.580
Heart transplant, huh?

05:48.582 --> 05:50.415
Yep. Bump?

05:50.417 --> 05:51.950
Yeah.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.051
I win.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.387
(chuckles)
You're humorous.

05:55.389 --> 05:58.123
That's good. You know,
humor is proven to

05:58.125 --> 06:00.492
boost the immune response
and speed recovery.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.427
Not that you need
to be concerned.

06:02.429 --> 06:04.830
40 years ago, heart transplants
were in their infancy,

06:04.832 --> 06:07.699
but with modern medicine,
you'll be just... fine.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.702
I know. Just in time, too.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.638
My color's graying,
fingers are cold,

06:13.640 --> 06:16.541
my heart's ejection fraction
is 12%.

06:17.978 --> 06:21.880
(chuckles) I... read a
lot about my condition.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.616
That's an advanced book
for someone your age.

06:25.586 --> 06:28.387
I've been around
so many doctors,

06:28.389 --> 06:30.922
I decided to become one.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.791
Figure I can help kids like me.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.860
Greater good.

06:34.861 --> 06:36.928
You should make sure that your
friends collect your schoolwork

06:36.930 --> 06:38.430
while you recover
so you don't fall behind.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.999
My teachers
will send my work home.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.100
Not your friends?

06:42.102 --> 06:43.902
I don't get out a lot.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.704
Miss a lot of school.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.706
It's tough making friends.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.641
All because one organ
in your body

06:49.643 --> 06:51.410
wasn't built
like everyone else's.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.514
I know how that feels.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.917
(coughing)

07:00.621 --> 07:02.687
Hey, hey, sweetie.

07:02.689 --> 07:06.691
Oh. You know what, um,
let's go get you some water.

07:06.693 --> 07:09.528
PAIGE:
Walter.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.796
Are you okay?

07:10.798 --> 07:12.631
Yeah, it's a
minor contusion.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.933
Uh, the guy who
hit me is also okay.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.435
He got sent home.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.069
Speaking of  which...
Whoa, hold on.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.788
Did you get your head examined?

07:19.789 --> 07:21.506
Yes. By more than 20 specialists

07:21.508 --> 07:22.607
throughout my childhood.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.608
You know what he means.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.544
You need diagnostic tests.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.212
What I need is
to get back to work.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.647
You know,
if today's taught me anything,

07:28.649 --> 07:29.648
it's to make every second count.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.550
So based on
my genetics

07:31.552 --> 07:33.718
and projected
scientific advancements,

07:33.720 --> 07:36.121
my life expectancy
is at 90 years.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.823
My life is
more than a third over.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.491
Want to trade?

07:39.493 --> 07:41.126
Okay, that girl over there,

07:41.128 --> 07:45.230
she is getting a heart
transplant and she's still

07:45.232 --> 07:47.232
thinking about
future productivity.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.767
I have a bump.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.936
I stopped my research
to play games today.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.504
That's not gonna happen again.

07:52.506 --> 07:55.507
I'm gonna use my life for
what is most important,

07:55.509 --> 07:57.242
and that is work.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.678
Well, as long as you have
your priorities straight.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.012
DOCTOR:
Make room!

08:01.014 --> 08:03.582
Prep Trauma Bay One with
two milligrams of lorazepam,

08:03.584 --> 08:05.917
D50, and clear the CT scanner.
Ma'am, please,

08:05.919 --> 08:08.587
out of the way! They're not
treating him properly.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.255
That's not just a seizure. Clear
the CT scanner. Sir, please.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.657
I'm a doctor. Is this man
also running a fever?

08:12.659 --> 08:13.525
Come on, let's go.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.060
If he has a fever,

08:15.061 --> 08:16.594
he could very well have
the Nibori virus.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.080
Look at the beginning

08:18.081 --> 08:19.564
of ulcers by his nostrils.
These are

08:19.566 --> 08:21.900
post-surgical complications,
likely the result of infection.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.418
Now, sir, please step aside.

08:23.419 --> 08:24.935
Those are indicative
of the Nibori virus!

08:24.938 --> 08:27.606
Sir, you are preventing me from
treating this patient. Security!

08:27.608 --> 08:29.207
I don't often play
the med school card,

08:29.209 --> 08:30.275
but I went to Harvard.

08:30.277 --> 08:31.810
Seriously?
You are giving

08:31.812 --> 08:33.979
this man improper care.
Run the test.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.280
Don't go anywhere.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.982
If you're right,
I'm gonna want to talk to you.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.017
If you're wrong,
I'm gonna have you arrested.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.086
Let's go.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.692
Well, you make friends
wherever we go.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.095
(elevator bell dings)

08:50.097 --> 08:54.132
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

08:54.134 --> 08:57.569
So much for not wasting
the rest of my life.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.571
Sir.

08:59.573 --> 09:00.872
Doctor.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.808
The patient tested positive
for Nibori virus.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.076
He's been quarantined.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.746
Now, how did you get
that diagnosis right?

09:07.748 --> 09:10.549
I remember everything
I ever learned in my training,

09:10.551 --> 09:12.684
every journal article and
research paper I've ever read.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.019
I'm a genius.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.154
Wow. And so humble.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.156
No, no. He means
he's an actual genius.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.592
They all are,
except for me and...

09:20.594 --> 09:22.160
that guy there.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.595
We work for Homeland.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.931
Be smart. Solve problems.
That's what we do.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.233
Oh, yeah? Well, we've got a
real head-scratcher right here.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.936
How the hell does a guy
who came in three days ago

09:30.938 --> 09:33.171
with a clean bill of health,
save for a routine appendectomy,

09:33.173 --> 09:34.172
wind up
with a lethal disease

09:34.174 --> 09:36.074
found only in
the Far East?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.108
He hasn't been
to Asia lately?

09:37.110 --> 09:38.209
Never been out of the U.S.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.678
Did you give him
any blood transfusions

09:39.680 --> 09:40.679
during the appendectomy?

09:40.681 --> 09:41.846
Two units.

09:41.848 --> 09:44.082
There's your
single point of failure.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.050
His what?

09:45.052 --> 09:46.785
He came in with no disease.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.120
You gave him blood--
now he has a disease.

09:49.122 --> 09:52.190
I'm not a genius, and even
I can figure that one out.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.992
No. All of our blood
is screened.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.160
WALTER:
Then your on-site

09:55.162 --> 09:56.628
blood storage is compromised.

09:56.629 --> 09:58.095
So if you give us access
to your computer,

09:58.098 --> 10:00.999
maybe we can possibly isolate
the issue.

10:01.001 --> 10:04.336
Well, I was expecting
to see some kind of a hack

10:04.338 --> 10:06.204
into the system controlling
the security doors

10:06.206 --> 10:08.073
and cameras,
but there's nothing.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.976
Fast-forwarding through
the video from the past week.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.812
Only people coming in here are
taking blood bags and leaving.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.080
No one's tampering.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.082
CABE:
Guys,

10:17.084 --> 10:19.618
Dr. Mohan has received
a disturbing e-mail.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.286
Two patients at
other L.A. hospitals

10:21.288 --> 10:23.088
were diagnosed with Nibori.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.823
Both had blood
transfusions.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.658
All area hospitals
get their blood

10:26.660 --> 10:29.094
from the county depository,
the Lipsger Blood Bank.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.062
So... it isn't
just this place.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.831
There's been
a system-wide contamination

10:32.833 --> 10:34.265
of the whole inventory.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.368
Dr. Mohan,
you just parted your lips

10:36.370 --> 10:38.203
to let in more O2--
a terror marker--

10:38.205 --> 10:39.638
what's up?

10:39.640 --> 10:41.172
As blood bank supervisor
for this hospital

10:41.174 --> 10:43.074
I work closely with
the county depository.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.210
They have a cache of
Nibori-diseased blood

10:45.212 --> 10:47.746
in the same facility
meant for research.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.814
So somehow the diseased
research blood

10:49.816 --> 10:51.983
got mixed in
with the healthy blood?

10:51.984 --> 10:54.151
That's the thing-- all the
labels on our blood bags here

10:54.154 --> 10:55.186
had the correct barcodes.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.755
They were labeled safe.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.223
Must be a printing error.
So there's no way

10:58.225 --> 11:00.158
of knowing which blood bags
have the virus.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.894
Anyone in the county getting a
transfusion could get infected.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.863
(phone rings)

11:04.865 --> 11:08.166
Well, what if we test
all the blood for Nibori

11:08.168 --> 11:09.434
and see which is safe to use?

11:09.436 --> 11:11.102
Those tests take 12 hours.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.238
An immediate viral test
can only be done on someone

11:13.240 --> 11:15.340
who's already infected
'cause the viral load's higher

11:15.342 --> 11:17.909
when it's already incubated.
Cabe, you need to get Homeland

11:17.911 --> 11:19.911
to shut down
the entire L.A. blood supply

11:19.913 --> 11:21.146
until it can get tested.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.215
No surgeries,
no transfusions,

11:23.216 --> 11:25.283
nothing. Can-can we get clean
blood from a blood drive?

11:25.285 --> 11:28.119
We can't replace 25,000 units
of blood with a blood drive.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.221
And if the hospital tries to buy
it from a national blood bank,

11:30.223 --> 11:32.073
it'll take a day to get here.

11:32.074 --> 11:33.924
A mix-up in labels
is gonna result in people dying.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.226
Not as many as if
there's a viral outbreak

11:35.228 --> 11:36.227
from tainted blood.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.862
Uh, guys,

11:37.864 --> 11:40.732
anyone else noticing how
freaked out our pal Mohan is?

11:40.734 --> 11:43.401
Doctor, do you have some info
you need to share with us?

11:43.403 --> 11:45.136
Uh, the hospital got an e-mail.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.238
Let me guess--
this wasn't a printing error.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.873
Someone reached out to tell you
this was on purpose,

11:48.875 --> 11:50.041
this was intentional.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.910
Yes.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.179
Bloody hell.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.247
♪ ♪

12:04.357 --> 12:06.307
There've been
threats to infiltrate

12:06.308 --> 12:08.258
the U.S. health care system
for years. This is terrorism.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.462
Is there some vaccine for Nibori
so the patients can still

12:10.464 --> 12:12.497
get procedures? There is,
but it takes two weeks

12:12.499 --> 12:14.099
to take effect.
That's too long.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.468
Uh, just got word--
the FBI's on the case.

12:16.470 --> 12:18.336
Homeland wants us
to get into it as well.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.805
Walter, can you trace
the source of the e-mail threat?

12:20.807 --> 12:23.108
Well, I'm doing what I can
from Dr. Mohan's phone,

12:23.110 --> 12:24.960
but the e-mail
was routed through Tor--

12:24.961 --> 12:26.811
it's virtually untraceable.
It could take weeks.

12:26.813 --> 12:28.379
Well, we don't have that long.
Any car accident, people

12:28.381 --> 12:30.415
that would normally live
are gonna die because

12:30.417 --> 12:33.084
there's no blood. Forget car
accidents-- What if we have another

12:33.086 --> 12:35.420
earthquake like last month's
without usable blood?

12:35.422 --> 12:38.223
What do you mean
you're stopping all surgeries?

12:38.225 --> 12:39.290
Oh, no. Olivia.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.391
I want nothing more

12:40.393 --> 12:42.260
than to perform
your daughter's surgery,

12:42.262 --> 12:44.162
but we don't have the blood
that is necessary

12:44.164 --> 12:47.098
for the operation. My daughter has
been on a wait list for seven years.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.267
They only moved her up because
her heart is failing.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.370
She has days.
This is her last chance.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.538
We can't go ahead with surgery
without having...

12:53.540 --> 12:56.307
Excuse me. Yeah,
I'm with Homeland,

12:56.309 --> 12:58.476
I'm working on the
tainted blood issue.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.846
I am a Type O negative,
I'm a universal donor.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.481
You can take what you need.

13:03.483 --> 13:06.384
It's appreciated, but Olivia has
an incredibly rare blood type--

13:06.386 --> 13:09.387
Lutheran AB negative--
which doesn't take Type O.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.056
That's less than
.0003% of the population.

13:12.058 --> 13:14.893
That's right.
The blood that we had

13:14.895 --> 13:17.562
for her surgery was the only
blood within 500 miles.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.898
Mom, I don't understand.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.166
No, it's okay, baby,

13:21.168 --> 13:22.367
we're gonna-we're gonna
figure this out.

13:22.369 --> 13:25.003
Don't you worry.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.338
(whispers): We both know there's
a 100% chance that she'll die

13:27.340 --> 13:29.407
if she doesn't get the heart
and only 10%

13:29.409 --> 13:31.409
if you use the blood,
so, statistically,

13:31.411 --> 13:33.211
it makes sense to do the surgery

13:33.213 --> 13:35.513
despite the risk.
State and federal regulations

13:35.515 --> 13:37.849
prohibit transfusing blood
that may be tainted.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.350
I'll lose my license
and be jailed,

13:39.352 --> 13:41.186
the hospital
could be decertified.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.387
Then test it!

13:42.389 --> 13:44.589
We do not have the time...

13:46.092 --> 13:49.093
A donor heart is good
for 24 hours after death.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.563
This one was held up in
a snowstorm in Bangor

13:51.565 --> 13:53.097
for 15 hours,
then medivaced here.

13:53.099 --> 13:55.433
It is only viable
for four and a half more hours.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.135
So if we can find out
who mixed up

13:57.137 --> 13:58.970
the blood, then maybe we
can figure out which blood

13:58.972 --> 14:00.171
is safe to use.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.040
And then you can
do the surgery on Olivia.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.209
But we have to do it
before that heart goes bad.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.411
And that would be
in under 270 minutes.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.479
No one can do that.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.249
She's wrong.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.586
We can and we will.

14:16.456 --> 14:19.457
Olivia, I promise,

14:19.459 --> 14:21.359
my team and I
are gonna save you.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.467
So we know the blood was somehow
mixed up between being donated

14:29.469 --> 14:31.202
and arriving
at hospitals.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.637
Correct.
So there are two options.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.139
There's screening lab
or distribution center.

14:35.141 --> 14:37.642
So, Happy, Toby, Paige and I
will split up and cover that.

14:37.644 --> 14:40.178
Sly, you try to
track the terrorist's e-mail

14:40.180 --> 14:43.181
and, Cabe, will stay with him
in case you get a lead.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.886
Every donation in L.A. County's
brought here;

14:47.888 --> 14:50.021
screened for over 100 diseases,

14:50.023 --> 14:52.090
separated into platelets,
red and white blood cells

14:52.092 --> 14:53.458
and other components.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.326
But we haven't noticed
anything amiss

14:55.328 --> 14:57.362
with our system.
Because there isn't.

14:57.364 --> 14:58.997
I pored over your code.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.965
Your computers
were not compromised.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.233
And there's been
no physical breach

15:02.235 --> 15:04.269
of your locks and your alarms.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.436
Those two employees
I spoke with earlier--

15:05.438 --> 15:06.537
are they the only ones

15:06.539 --> 15:08.640
with access to the system?
Yes.

15:08.642 --> 15:11.342
Well, then it wasn't an inside
job. I saw honesty markers

15:11.344 --> 15:13.177
on each of them.
They didn't do it.

15:13.179 --> 15:15.446
Neither did you.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.148
Thank you.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.349
I think.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.084
Uh, we're burning time

15:20.086 --> 15:21.486
and Olivia needs that blood.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.955
I sure hope Cabe and Sly
got something.

15:23.957 --> 15:26.357
I got nothing. The metadata
from the terrorist's e-mail

15:26.359 --> 15:28.293
lacks a geotag to
pinpoint its location.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.662
The strange thing is
the e-mail was transferred

15:30.664 --> 15:33.464
at a very slow rate--
14.4K modem slow.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.166
Why the hell
would someone use dialup?

15:35.168 --> 15:36.534
Even I know that's ancient.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.303
Because it's actually harder
to trace old-school tech

15:38.305 --> 15:39.888
than a modern wireless signal.

15:39.889 --> 15:41.472
But I'm hacking the phone
company's servers

15:41.474 --> 15:45.276
to see where the data is being
sent at such a snail's pace.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.511
I think this is the connection

15:46.513 --> 15:48.613
that is being siphoned.
Santa Clarita--

15:48.615 --> 15:51.282
a rural spot would help
the terrorists avoid being seen.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.550
I can track the general area

15:52.552 --> 15:54.118
and see where the service
is being stolen.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.220
All right, grab your laptop.
We'll do it from the car.

15:56.222 --> 15:58.356
We got to get out to Santa Clarita.
Okay.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.358
All of our blood is sorted
via barcode.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.460
When blood arrives,
be it for use or research,

16:02.462 --> 16:03.561
it goes through
a labeling process

16:03.563 --> 16:05.296
that's state-of-the-art.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.698
(scoffs) Till now.
Walter.

16:06.700 --> 16:09.534
So I assume that your
state-of-the-art facility

16:09.536 --> 16:11.636
has, uh, periodic
software upgrades.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.671
Of course. We had one
just last week. Why?

16:13.673 --> 16:16.174
Well, a, uh, system
upgrade is a good time

16:16.176 --> 16:17.542
to tamper with the code,
seeing as the firewalls

16:17.544 --> 16:19.711
get temporarily shut down.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.615
This computer came out around
the time I was born.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.150
You know my theory?

16:26.152 --> 16:28.553
They lit a ten-hour wick
and took off, the wick

16:28.555 --> 16:31.022
burned down, released
this marble, it fell off this,

16:31.024 --> 16:32.623
hit the bird,
which hit the enter key.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.625
Perfectly timed to send the
e-mail just as they knew

16:34.627 --> 16:36.527
the first symptoms would hit
after exposure to the virus.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.997
Ten-hour fuse gave 'em
a ten-hour head start.

16:38.999 --> 16:41.332
They were smart-- they parked
on deserted state land,

16:41.334 --> 16:43.501
spliced into this phone line
so they couldn't be traced,

16:43.503 --> 16:45.603
(beeping) set up shop in a camper
with no VIN or registration.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.572
Whoever did this
won't be easy to find.

16:47.574 --> 16:50.174
There's a breaking news report.
"The L.A. blood supply

16:50.176 --> 16:52.744
"has been contaminated with
the deadly Nibori virus.

16:52.746 --> 16:54.746
"Federal agencies
are investigating

16:54.748 --> 16:56.214
what may be terrorism."

16:56.216 --> 16:58.216
Now the panic starts.

16:58.217 --> 17:00.217
And here we are in the middle
of nowhere at a total dead end.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.723
Maybe not.

17:07.427 --> 17:08.693
Over here.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.395
These tracks by the shed.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.563
Well, the shed is the first
thing we checked

17:12.565 --> 17:13.564
when we got here.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.366
But what we want, we can't see.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.535
At least not without help.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.438
Okay, so I can see the system
was shut down

17:20.440 --> 17:23.374
for the upgrade on the first
of March and then again

17:23.376 --> 17:24.742
briefly on the third.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.611
PAIGE: You think someone
altered the barcoding

17:26.613 --> 17:28.046
software during the shutdown?

17:28.048 --> 17:29.447
Yeah, and then they
went back in to remove

17:29.449 --> 17:30.748
digital evidence on the third.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.251
Okay, so, let's see...

17:33.253 --> 17:35.420
What are you doing?

17:35.421 --> 17:37.588
Well, whoever did this deleted
their tracks from the system,

17:37.590 --> 17:41.426
but they may have left a ghost
trace on the company router.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.094
It's a remnant of code.

17:43.096 --> 17:46.130
So if we can find one,
we may be able to fix

17:46.132 --> 17:48.599
the system
and re-sort the blood.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.535
Who would've known
about this system shutdown?

17:50.537 --> 17:52.470
Before an upgrade,
we alert our customers

17:52.472 --> 17:54.138
that online ordering
will be down.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.840
Clinics, labs, hospitals
and universities.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.508
Over 200 in all.

17:57.510 --> 17:58.643
We'll need that list.

17:58.645 --> 17:59.644
Okay, I found a ghost trace.

17:59.646 --> 18:00.711
So it looks like
they put a bug

18:00.713 --> 18:02.780
into the labeling software

18:02.782 --> 18:05.349
to scramble the barcodes
so it would mix up the blood.

18:05.351 --> 18:08.152
That's how tainted blood
meant for research labs

18:08.154 --> 18:09.720
went to hospitals--
some bug?

18:09.722 --> 18:11.289
Right. So if we figure it out,

18:11.291 --> 18:13.658
we can unscramble the barcodes.
How exactly?

18:13.660 --> 18:17.595
Um... Okay, uh...

18:17.597 --> 18:20.164
So, every bag

18:20.166 --> 18:23.634
of donated blood is assigned
a six-digit barcode.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.537
For example:
one, two, three,

18:26.539 --> 18:27.839
four, five, six.

18:27.841 --> 18:29.640
So, bags with certain barcodes

18:29.642 --> 18:32.477
indicate research blood
or medical blood. But...

18:32.479 --> 18:35.847
our bad guys' bug changed
each number of the barcodes

18:35.849 --> 18:38.216
by a specific amount--
that's a magic algorithm.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.484
So, for instance,

18:39.486 --> 18:42.253
it might make
the first number

18:42.255 --> 18:44.856
go up by two.
So one becomes three.

18:44.858 --> 18:47.592
Then the second go down by one,

18:47.594 --> 18:49.293
so two becomes one.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.729
And so on...

18:51.731 --> 18:55.666
until your original barcode

18:55.668 --> 18:57.568
becomes a completely
inaccurate barcode

18:57.570 --> 18:59.403
due to a bug
implemented into your software.

18:59.405 --> 19:00.671
And that
incorrect barcode

19:00.673 --> 19:03.374
is printed on a label
and put on a blood bag.

19:03.376 --> 19:04.675
This is a nightmare.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.244
It's a nightmare
that gets worse.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.912
Since we don't know
the magic algorithm

19:07.914 --> 19:10.615
used to change the barcode,
we can't reverse what it's done

19:10.617 --> 19:12.583
to find out what the original
barcodes really are.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.684
Can we figure out the algorithm?

19:13.686 --> 19:15.253
Not in time to save Olivia.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.754
We're talking about
millions of combinations.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.357
Well, Toby says no one
chooses anything at random.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.893
So maybe if we want to learn
the algorithm, we need

19:21.895 --> 19:24.428
to learn more
about our bad guys.

19:24.430 --> 19:27.198
Look at all of these cans.
What do you see?

19:27.200 --> 19:29.334
Garbage.
No,

19:29.335 --> 19:31.469
they're old, the fumes from
them have leaked over years,

19:31.471 --> 19:34.405
collecting residue
on the interior tin walls.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.174
CABE:
So what?

19:36.176 --> 19:39.877
So there's a bullet
hole here in this wall.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.546
A concentrated beam
of light has been

19:41.548 --> 19:43.748
pouring into this
very shed for decades,

19:43.750 --> 19:45.783
creating a massive
pinhole camera.

19:45.785 --> 19:46.851
Those things we made in school
where the pictures

19:46.853 --> 19:48.352
come in upside down?

19:48.354 --> 19:50.888
Yes. And pesticide residue
is made of halide vapor,

19:50.890 --> 19:53.491
which has basically
turned this piece of tin

19:53.493 --> 19:55.626
into a giant sheet
of photographic paper.

19:55.628 --> 19:58.529
Great. But what did our tin shed
take a picture of?

19:58.531 --> 20:00.798
Normally nothing, because
it's just open space out there.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.434
But the tire tracks indicate
that whoever set up the computer

20:03.436 --> 20:06.871
parked their car directly
in line with the pinhole.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.439
It's like the car
was saying "cheese" for us.

20:08.441 --> 20:09.907
All we have to do
is develop the film.

20:09.909 --> 20:10.908
Then let's take our photo home.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.848
So we're really gonna
get a photo off a tin wall

20:17.850 --> 20:19.517
by dipping it
into this stuff?

20:19.519 --> 20:20.851
Mint and coffee
contain caffeic acid,

20:20.853 --> 20:23.387
which converts
silver ions in the tin

20:23.389 --> 20:26.724
to pure silver, which will
produce a negative image.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.559
The stopper solution is
ready. The lemon juice

20:28.561 --> 20:30.294
to water ratio is perfect.

20:30.296 --> 20:32.797
Just enough to neutralize
the caffeic acid while still

20:32.799 --> 20:33.965
preserving the image.

20:33.967 --> 20:35.433
Okay,
that's enough--

20:35.435 --> 20:38.836
take it out.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.838
Holy crap, it worked.

20:42.442 --> 20:43.841
WALTER: Okay, we've got
the license plate.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.376
Let's see who sent that e-mail.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.280
Just ran the plate
through the DMV.

20:49.282 --> 20:52.550
It's registered to one
Todd Wilcox of Sherman Oaks.

20:52.552 --> 20:54.986
Guys, start pulling
everything you can on him.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.455
WALTER:
Oh. Wilcox.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.789
He was on the list
of blood bank customers

20:58.791 --> 21:00.024
who got the e-mail
about the shutdown.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.392
TOBY:
Well, here's why.

21:01.394 --> 21:04.595
He's CEO of Wilcox Pharma Group,

21:04.597 --> 21:06.797
developer of medical products

21:06.799 --> 21:09.400
including a vaccine
for the Nibori virus!

21:09.402 --> 21:11.769
Ladies and gents,
we have a motive!

21:11.771 --> 21:14.972
He spent over a decade
developing a vaccine for Nibori

21:14.974 --> 21:16.274
that was spreading across Asia.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.059
But his product tanked when

21:18.060 --> 21:19.843
the virus was nearly eradicated
before he got it to the market.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.912
And he was left
with a struggling company

21:21.914 --> 21:23.714
and warehouses full
of unusable vaccines.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.050
Livid he'd wasted so much time
on a failed venture,

21:26.052 --> 21:28.953
he did what businessmen do:
he created demand,

21:28.955 --> 21:31.789
and the kind of demand
that only comes with panic.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.924
Hence the e-mail
ensuring his crime went public.

21:33.926 --> 21:35.326
It's already working.

21:35.328 --> 21:36.861
People are running
to buy his vaccine.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.462
He'll make billions.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.398
Wasn't terrorism.
It was capitalism.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.832
He'd do this just for money?

21:41.834 --> 21:43.000
WALTER:
His whole life's work

21:43.002 --> 21:44.485
dissolved overnight.

21:44.486 --> 21:45.969
It's driven more than a few
researchers to desperation.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.071
You taking notes, O'Brien?

21:47.073 --> 21:48.439
PAIGE:
So we call the cops,

21:48.441 --> 21:49.674
they arrest him,

21:49.676 --> 21:51.543
we make him tell us
the algorithm

21:51.544 --> 21:53.411
to reverse the barcodes, and we
save Olivia and everyone else.

21:53.413 --> 21:54.879
No, he'll lawyer up
and say nothing.

21:54.881 --> 21:57.882
We need to find out that
algorithm on our own and fast.

21:57.884 --> 21:59.383
PAIGE: Whole point
of finding out who

21:59.385 --> 22:00.785
the culprit was,
was to figure out

22:00.787 --> 22:02.019
the algorithm
he programmed into his bug.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.688
Well, now we know who it is.

22:03.690 --> 22:04.922
She's right.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.525
We search his history,
contacts, everything--

22:07.527 --> 22:10.027
from jersey numbers
of his favorite players

22:10.029 --> 22:11.662
to phone numbers
of old girlfriends.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.365
We find out what digits have
deep meaning to Wilcox.

22:14.367 --> 22:15.900
Let's hit it!

22:15.902 --> 22:18.035
(phone rings)

22:18.037 --> 22:19.804
(phone beeps)
Hello?

22:19.806 --> 22:21.405
Mr. O'Brien,
this is Dr. Bennett.

22:21.407 --> 22:22.873
Please tell me
that you are close

22:22.875 --> 22:24.041
to decoding the blood bags.

22:24.043 --> 22:26.010
We're<i> closer,</i> but not close.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.011
(rhythmic beeping)

22:27.013 --> 22:28.546
(gasping for air)

22:28.548 --> 22:30.481
Okay, if you don't hurry,

22:30.483 --> 22:32.483
there's not gonna be
any blood<i> to</i> sort.

22:32.485 --> 22:34.952
Administration is loading our
supply into a transport truck

22:34.954 --> 22:37.021
and taking it
to a testing facility.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.523
It leaves in an hour.

22:38.524 --> 22:40.024
Walter, once any blood
enters a federal lab,

22:40.026 --> 22:41.425
U.S. law prohibits it

22:41.427 --> 22:42.927
from leaving that facility
for 96 hours.

22:42.929 --> 22:43.994
BENNETT:
That's right.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.730
And Olivia is getting weaker.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.098
If you don't get
her that blood

22:47.100 --> 22:48.466
before it
reaches that lab,

22:48.468 --> 22:49.967
there's nothing
I can do for her.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.477
(sighs)

22:59.479 --> 23:01.078
We've researched birthdays,
anniversaries,

23:01.080 --> 23:03.080
graduation dates.

23:03.082 --> 23:04.448
Nothing will reverse the bug.

23:04.450 --> 23:06.150
Yeah, he's too smart
to use something

23:06.152 --> 23:07.535
that we could find easily.

23:07.536 --> 23:08.919
It'd be something
that we'd never think of.

23:08.921 --> 23:10.955
So, the only way to
get it out of him

23:10.957 --> 23:12.089
is to hack his brain.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.858
We need to meet Wilcox
face-to-face,

23:13.860 --> 23:15.627
trick the algorithm out of him,

23:15.628 --> 23:17.395
without him having any idea
what we're actually doing.

23:17.397 --> 23:18.562
Toby's right, but we have

23:18.564 --> 23:20.998
just under two and a half hours
to do it.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.767
So, the question is,
how do we get next to him?

23:22.769 --> 23:24.835
Here's how. He just called
a press conference.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.771
Yeah, 'cause the profiteer wants
to spread word

23:26.773 --> 23:28.172
about his vaccine,
he wants publicity.

23:28.174 --> 23:29.173
Great.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.442
Let's go help him.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.912
(birds singing,
crowd chatter)

23:41.954 --> 23:44.188
TOBY:
Pick a spot that maximizes

23:44.190 --> 23:45.823
your chances
of being called on.

23:45.825 --> 23:48.459
Paige, he wants to seem
like a man of the people,

23:48.461 --> 23:51.028
so he's gonna call more
frequently on those at the back,

23:51.030 --> 23:53.130
where the less established
journalists are. You go there.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.615
Copy that.

23:54.616 --> 23:56.099
Okay, sun's coming over
his left shoulder,

23:56.102 --> 23:57.668
casting a shadow
on the right.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.770
Eyes naturally
are drawn to the light.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.138
Uh, he'll look
to his left.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.907
I'll go there.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.909
They're in position
just in time.

24:04.911 --> 24:07.745
TOBY: Overly brisk walk,
ramrod posture.

24:07.747 --> 24:08.913
He's tense,

24:08.915 --> 24:10.448
focused on staying on message.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.216
First thing when you want

24:12.217 --> 24:13.983
to get something out of someone:
make them comfortable.

24:13.986 --> 24:16.187
Don't say anything
blunt or harsh.

24:16.189 --> 24:17.922
In other words, Happy,
don't be yourself.

24:17.924 --> 24:20.124
I'd be offended by that
if it weren't so true.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.692
Okay, I know I'm the only one

24:21.694 --> 24:23.878
who wears a hat,
but hold onto your hats,

24:23.879 --> 24:25.364
'cause I'm gonna profile
the crap out of this guy.

24:25.390 --> 24:26.363
WILCOX: Good afternoon.

24:26.365 --> 24:28.732
As you know, a terrible
health crisis has developed.

24:28.734 --> 24:31.502
Nibori, a disease
once nearly eradicated, has

24:31.504 --> 24:32.837
tragically reemerged.

24:32.839 --> 24:35.639
Luckily, my company,
Wilcox Pharma Group,

24:35.641 --> 24:38.108
has a vaccine
to prevent further spread.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.144
Not only is it
readily available,

24:40.146 --> 24:42.146
but to help my fellow citizens,

24:42.148 --> 24:44.081
I'm donating 1,000
free vaccines.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.250
It's time to build him up. Give
him a chance to sound smart.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.252
(overlapping shouting)

24:48.254 --> 24:49.220
Yes?

24:49.222 --> 24:51.088
Uh, how does the virus spread?

24:51.090 --> 24:52.823
Via contaminated blood.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.625
And now that the L.A. County
blood supply

24:54.627 --> 24:56.660
has been found
to be tainted, no one is safe.

24:56.662 --> 25:00.164
The smart move for everybody
is to get vaccinated.

25:00.166 --> 25:01.565
Good work, Happy.

25:01.567 --> 25:04.201
He's relaxing his posture,
he's feeling

25:04.203 --> 25:06.103
more comfortable,
defenses are going down.

25:06.105 --> 25:07.972
Now, this is a guy
who is willing

25:07.974 --> 25:09.507
to sacrifice lives to get rich,

25:09.509 --> 25:12.176
so, make him talk about
his favorite subject: money.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.011
(overlapping shouting)
In the back.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.013
Yes. Will this vaccine
be affordable?

25:16.015 --> 25:17.915
Affordability is
my top priority.

25:17.917 --> 25:19.216
For three decades,

25:19.218 --> 25:21.852
I've seen the damage
that price gouging can do,

25:21.854 --> 25:24.255
so we're offering our vaccine
at below market value.

25:24.257 --> 25:26.624
Three decades? He's 46.

25:26.626 --> 25:29.093
Learned about price gouging
as a teen?

25:29.095 --> 25:31.629
Sly, look up his life at 15.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.531
That'd be 1987.

25:33.533 --> 25:35.699
Oh, my God.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.234
I know.

25:37.236 --> 25:38.903
Long rap sheet
for a juvenile.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.704
No, no, no, I mean
his student council photos.

25:40.706 --> 25:41.872
Are those parachute pants?

25:41.874 --> 25:44.608
His record is also bad.

25:44.610 --> 25:46.977
He got into a lot
of trouble at age 15.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.245
That's, uh, school
suspensions, shoplifting.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.948
Yeah, next to me at that age,
he was a saint.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.717
Trust me, kids with
that behavior are scared.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.119
And when they grow up,

25:55.121 --> 25:57.721
they not only crave the
comfort they lacked as children,

25:57.723 --> 26:00.190
they want to feel that they can
provide comfort themselves.

26:00.192 --> 26:03.160
The people of Los Angeles
and the nation are scared.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.995
What can you say
to reassure them?

26:04.997 --> 26:07.264
To them I'll say,
the vaccines work.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.600
I'll protect their families:

26:09.602 --> 26:12.069
their mothers,
their fathers,

26:12.071 --> 26:14.104
everyone.
Their mothers and fathers? No.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.639
When people talk about
protecting someone,

26:15.640 --> 26:17.173
they generally talk about
children, not their parents.

26:17.176 --> 26:19.009
We shouldn't be looking
at what happened to him.

26:19.011 --> 26:21.712
We should be looking at what happened
to his mom and dad. Ooh, hold on,

26:21.714 --> 26:24.214
because I had found something
on his parents before.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.250
Right here.
When he was 15 years old,

26:26.252 --> 26:28.719
the factory his father worked at
was sold to a consortium.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.721
All of the jobs went overseas.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.222
They lost their main source
of income,

26:32.224 --> 26:33.357
and the bank foreclosed
upon their home.

26:33.359 --> 26:34.959
Get specifics on all this!

26:34.961 --> 26:36.293
(phone rings)

26:38.230 --> 26:40.631
Dr. Bennett? BENNETT: Walter,

26:40.633 --> 26:43.233
this donor heart is becoming
unusable faster than expected.

26:43.235 --> 26:44.802
For Olivia to have a shot,

26:44.804 --> 26:46.704
we need
to start the surgery now.

26:46.705 --> 26:48.605
That means that I need
safe blood for her by 3:00 p.m.

26:48.608 --> 26:49.707
Can you get it to me?

26:49.709 --> 26:51.875
Thank you all
very much for coming.

26:51.877 --> 26:54.178
He's leaving! We don't
have the algorithm yet!

26:54.180 --> 26:56.213
Walter, I need your answer.

26:56.215 --> 26:57.765
Toby, do we have this?

26:57.766 --> 26:59.316
Not yet. Sly?
Uh, I'm searching!

26:59.318 --> 27:01.318
BENNETT:
Mr. O'Brien?

27:01.320 --> 27:02.720
Ah! Look what I found!
Does this help?

27:02.722 --> 27:03.887
Sure does!

27:03.889 --> 27:05.689
Start the surgery.

27:05.691 --> 27:07.691
They call me the gambler.

27:07.693 --> 27:09.193
Let's go.

27:09.195 --> 27:10.361
(crying)

27:10.363 --> 27:12.863
(beeping)

27:12.865 --> 27:15.199
What did you find?
SYLVESTER: All right.

27:15.201 --> 27:16.800
When Wilcox's family
lost their house,

27:16.802 --> 27:18.168
when his family fell apart,

27:18.170 --> 27:20.371
when his life was turned
upside down forever,

27:20.373 --> 27:24.808
it was all over a very
specific number-- $117,586,

27:24.810 --> 27:27.077
the exact amount

27:27.079 --> 27:28.646
his home was foreclosed for.

27:28.648 --> 27:29.813
Six digits, like the barcode.

27:29.815 --> 27:31.015
That could be
the magic algorithm.

27:31.017 --> 27:33.183
It's a number
he'll never forget.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.135
It burned into his memory
as an adolescent.

27:35.136 --> 27:37.086
That's a number that could drive
him to do terrible things.

27:39.825 --> 27:43.327
(computer trilling)

27:43.329 --> 27:46.063
Oh. It's working!
The fake barcodes are reversing

27:46.065 --> 27:48.666
back to proper barcodes,
and now we'll be able to tell

27:48.668 --> 27:50.300
which blood bags
are safe to use!

27:50.302 --> 27:52.269
I'll get the blood bank
on the phone to confirm.

27:52.271 --> 27:53.937
All those are going back
to the original barcodes?

27:53.939 --> 27:54.972
Yeah. I'm pulling up
the bag number

27:54.974 --> 27:56.140
for Olivia's blood

27:56.142 --> 27:57.307
that Dr. Bennett gave me.

27:57.309 --> 27:58.275
TOBY:
I got Walter O'Brien

27:58.277 --> 28:01.245
on the phone
for you, sir.

28:01.247 --> 28:04.348
Was 587332 a number assigned

28:04.350 --> 28:05.883
to clean blood
or research blood?

28:05.885 --> 28:07.384
It was clean, for a very rare

28:07.386 --> 28:09.353
Lutheran AB negative.

28:09.355 --> 28:10.821
Okay, thank you.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.990
So, we know
that there is blood

28:12.992 --> 28:14.458
that can save Olivia.
Yeah,

28:14.460 --> 28:16.226
but it's on its way
to a research lab,

28:16.228 --> 28:17.995
and once it's inside,
it can't be removed for days.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.930
We are Homeland!
Can't we just call

28:19.932 --> 28:23.000
to set up a blockade and
then stop the truck? No.

28:23.002 --> 28:25.169
The federal government wants
to test that blood themselves.

28:25.171 --> 28:26.336
After all this press,

28:26.338 --> 28:28.038
they're not taking
our word for it

28:28.040 --> 28:29.206
and putting themselves at risk.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.274
Not for the life of one girl.

28:30.276 --> 28:31.975
Then we know what
we have to do.

28:31.977 --> 28:34.078
We're gonna hijack
that truck.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.253
Okay. Thank you.
Well, the hospital said

28:43.255 --> 28:44.488
the blood transport
left eight minutes ago!

28:44.490 --> 28:45.956
We need to approach
this vehicle

28:45.958 --> 28:47.024
directly from behind
and make sure

28:47.026 --> 28:48.258
the driver doesn't see us.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.010
We know they're going
to Bakersfield.

28:50.011 --> 28:51.761
Bio-hazardous material has
to stay off interstates.

28:51.764 --> 28:53.163
Big trucks aren't
hitting 70.

28:53.165 --> 28:54.932
We'll catch 'em
around 58 West.

28:54.934 --> 28:56.934
I just found a schematic
for the truck.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.836
It has a rooftop
ventilation grate.

28:58.838 --> 29:01.105
We need a vehicle
at least 14 feet tall.

29:01.107 --> 29:02.439
This SUV will not do.

29:02.441 --> 29:04.208
We don't have time
to turn around and go back

29:04.210 --> 29:06.343
to the Homeland impound
to get a bigger ride.

29:06.345 --> 29:10.047
I actually know of a vehicle
that height on the way,

29:10.049 --> 29:12.216
though speed might be an issue.

29:13.953 --> 29:16.286
SYLVESTER:
<i> Remember seventh grade math?</i>

29:16.288 --> 29:18.021

to car B?

29:18.023 --> 29:20.157
I was really good at those,
and we need to move faster!

29:20.159 --> 29:22.243
I'm trying,

29:22.244 --> 29:24.328
but this Nixon-era engine
ain't doing us any favors!

29:24.330 --> 29:26.096
