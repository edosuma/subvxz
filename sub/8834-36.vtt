It'll do the kid some good.

[Mrs. Vandersnoot] Let them.
At least you won't get hurt.

09:03.166 --> 09:05.709
Now, Miss Cunningham,
I must have your assurance

09:05.792 --> 09:08.083
that this flight will be perfectly safe.

09:08.458 --> 09:10.959
Perfectly safe, Mrs. Vandersnoot.

09:11.542 --> 09:12.709
[Baloo] Psst.

12:05.583 --> 12:08.417
[rotors whirring]

12:09.125 --> 12:11.625
[Don Karnage] What nincompoopery is this?

12:12.041 --> 12:14.375
Any silly fool can see
this is not the <i>Sea Duck.</i>

12:14.458 --> 12:16.792
But here's the secret weapon.

12:16.959 --> 12:21.875
You know, I would brain you
if you had a brain.

12:21.959 --> 12:23.709
These friends of Baloo
are useless.

12:23.792 --> 12:25.125
They have no money, bad breath,

12:25.208 --> 12:27.375
and their mother dresses them
into silly clothes.

12:27.458 --> 12:29.750
I'm not afraid of you, Don <i>Garbage</i>!

12:29.959 --> 12:32.333
-Watch who you're calling useless!
-[growls]

12:32.417 --> 12:34.083
Yeah. What he said.

12:35.041 --> 12:36.959
-[thump]
-[Don Karnage] You have a quick tongue.

12:37.041 --> 12:40.542
Keep it somewhere quiet.
Like in your closed up mouth.

12:40.625 --> 12:44.542
But let us not be the hasty bullies.

12:44.625 --> 12:46.792
My incredibly calculating mind

12:46.875 --> 12:49.917
may have devised a use for you, after all.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.375
[airplane engine revving]

12:51.458 --> 12:53.000
[Baloo] Keep a sharp eye, now.

12:53.458 --> 12:55.792
You never know when those pesky pirates

12:55.875 --> 12:57.875
will come swooping out of the sky.

12:57.959 --> 12:58.834
Guns blazing.

12:58.917 --> 12:59.750
Baloo!

12:59.834 --> 13:01.792
P... p... pirates!

13:01.875 --> 13:04.959
[chuckles]
Well, we'll just show them a trick or...

13:05.333 --> 13:06.792
Yeow!

13:06.875 --> 13:09.709
Hold onto your socks, slick.
This is gonna get rough.

13:13.959 --> 13:17.542
Was that what they call a-a near miss?

13:17.834 --> 13:19.542
Kiddo, that was a near hit.

13:19.625 --> 13:20.834
Now, if you hadn't hollered when you did,

13:20.917 --> 13:23.583
we'd be sitting in those clouds,
plucking harps.

13:24.083 --> 13:26.291
You mean, I did something right?

13:26.709 --> 13:29.291
Yeah, but don't bust it off
patting yourself on the back.

13:29.375 --> 13:30.709
This ain't over yet.

13:30.792 --> 13:33.041
[gunfire]

13:41.667 --> 13:43.417
Now what?

13:43.500 --> 13:45.667
We'll lose them at Dead-End Cave.

13:45.917 --> 13:47.667
If we don't get lost ourselves.

13:47.750 --> 13:49.667
We'll need lights. Pull that knob.

13:50.208 --> 13:51.709
-[Oscar] This one?
-[Baloo] No!

13:51.792 --> 13:53.375
[gunfire continues]

13:54.375 --> 13:55.500
[splash]

13:55.709 --> 13:57.125
[Baloo] Nice move, slick.

13:57.208 --> 13:58.583
Now, hit the lights.

13:58.667 --> 13:59.667
[Oscar] Right.

14:07.959 --> 14:10.041
[stuttering]
How far to the other end?

14:10.458 --> 14:13.792
Yeah, that's the tricky part, slick.
There isn't any other end.

14:13.875 --> 14:14.917
What?

14:15.458 --> 14:17.709
[dramatic music]

14:20.375 --> 14:21.667

14:38.667 --> 14:40.750
What's that two-bit buccaneer want?

14:40.875 --> 14:43.542
I got nothing to say to you, Karnage.

14:43.709 --> 14:47.083
[Don Karnage] <i>Well then,</i>
<i>perhaps you'd like to say hello</i>

14:47.166 --> 14:48.667
<i>to your friends</i>

14:48.750 --> 14:51.709
who are now enjoying my hospitableness.

14:51.792 --> 14:53.458
Surrender your secret weapon,

14:53.542 --> 14:57.250
and I will let them go, maybe even alive.

14:57.333 --> 14:58.542
[microphone stand squeaks]

14:58.625 --> 15:01.083
Don't do it, Baloo! Save yourselves.

15:01.166 --> 15:02.166
Kit!

15:02.250 --> 15:04.792
OK, Karnage, you win.

15:04.875 --> 15:05.750
Baloo, no!

15:05.834 --> 15:07.291
[Don Karnage] Of course I win.

15:07.375 --> 15:09.542
Get them to the brig. Not gently.

15:14.458 --> 15:17.375
Now we blast them out of the sky
with this, right?

15:17.458 --> 15:21.542
[sighs]
I'm sorry, kid. That's no secret weapon.

15:21.625 --> 15:25.000
We sort of put this trip together
to get you into that club.

15:25.542 --> 15:28.125
Kit and Wildcat
were gonna play pirates, and--

15:28.208 --> 15:31.709
You mean, this whole adventure was a fake?

15:31.792 --> 15:33.709
Yeah, but not anymore.

15:33.792 --> 15:36.959
Now, come on. I got a plan
to bail us out of this mess.

15:37.041 --> 15:38.083
[swishing]

15:38.166 --> 15:40.500
[Mad Dog] Captain, they bailed out.

15:40.583 --> 15:43.583
Never mind. We have the weapon.
The boy we can grab anytime.

15:43.667 --> 15:46.583
He and Baloo are but small potatoes.

15:49.417 --> 15:50.375
[Don Karnage] To the brig!

15:50.458 --> 15:52.917
[chuckles]
We will torture this weapon's secret

15:53.041 --> 15:55.208
from our squeamish prisoners.

15:56.250 --> 15:58.250
OK, you stay here.

15:58.458 --> 16:02.125
I'll blast down the brig door and be back
before you can say "Jack Rabbit".

16:05.458 --> 16:07.166
[Don Karnage] This is getting nowhere
too fast.

16:07.250 --> 16:10.250
I see I must resort
to even higher heights of lowness.

16:10.875 --> 16:12.667
For the last time,

16:12.750 --> 16:15.417
how do I use this weapon?

16:15.500 --> 16:17.875
I told you it's a fake.

16:18.083 --> 16:21.625
It's just a propane tank
with a lot of stuff stuck on it.

16:21.875 --> 16:26.208
Very well. You force me
to do terrible things I...

16:26.291 --> 16:27.125
[inhales sharply]

16:27.208 --> 16:29.750
...enjoy doing anyway.

16:33.875 --> 16:36.875
Hang on, kid. I'll have you out in...

16:36.959 --> 16:37.834
Oh, no!

16:37.917 --> 16:39.083
Oh!

16:39.166 --> 16:41.000
No matches.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.959
[Mad Dog] You say you want a light?

[Kit] No, please!

of you to join us, Baloo.

[chains rattling]

17:10.875 --> 17:13.208
I'll tell you this, I give you a pardon.

17:13.290 --> 17:16.500
I shall torture all three of you
for the price of one.

17:16.750 --> 17:19.791
-Baloo!
-Sorry, kid. We're sunk.

17:19.875 --> 17:21.666
Yeah, but they haven't caught Oscar.
