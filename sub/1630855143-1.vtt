WEBVTT

00:57.057 --> 00:58.971
Pick up, Nicolette!

00:59.102 --> 01:01.278
Please pick up!

01:14.204 --> 01:15.379
No, no, no!

01:23.518 --> 01:25.172
Get in the car, Brooke.

01:37.836 --> 01:39.447
Let's go.

01:40.274 --> 01:41.753
Woman: You got her.

01:41.884 --> 01:43.320
Yeah. But she was
on the phone

01:43.407 --> 01:44.582
with this girl, Nicolette.

01:44.669 --> 01:47.846
-Who's got the phone?
-I have Brooke's phone.

01:47.933 --> 01:49.935
We'll use it to track the other
girl and see what she's up to.

01:50.021 --> 01:51.110
-Keep me posted.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.910
Excuse me. Have
you seen this girl?

02:10.217 --> 02:12.219
If you do, can you contact
that number at the bottom?

02:12.349 --> 02:13.437
Thank you.

02:30.280 --> 02:33.327
Hi there. Um, have
you seen this girl?

02:33.457 --> 02:35.372
OK. She's a really
good friend of mine.

02:35.459 --> 02:37.591
Her name's Brooke Summers.
If you happen to see her,

02:37.722 --> 02:39.550
then can you please contact
this number at the bottom?

02:39.680 --> 02:42.466
Thank you.

02:42.597 --> 02:45.687
Hi. Um, I was just wondering
if you've seen this girl.

02:45.774 --> 02:46.949
She's been missing
for a couple days.

02:50.692 --> 02:53.303
Sorry to interrupt.
Have you seen this girl?

02:53.434 --> 02:54.870
She's a really good
friend of mine.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.176
She's been missing
for a couple of days.

02:56.263 --> 02:59.135
If you happen to see her,
can you just contact me?

02:59.266 --> 03:01.268
Woman on phone:
Where are you now?

03:01.398 --> 03:02.878
I've been tracking the girl
she was trying to call.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.401
Woman: Good. And
you found her?

03:04.488 --> 03:06.098
She's actively
looking for Brooke.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.013
-We can't have her
mess with the plan.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.798
You need to stop this.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.713
I understand what
needs to be done.

03:21.113 --> 03:22.332
Sorry! I, I
didn't see you.

03:32.037 --> 03:35.692
Oh, uh... Have you
seen this girl?

03:39.697 --> 03:41.525
Uh, no. Sorry.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.504
Man's voice: You think
this is it, finally?

04:03.591 --> 04:05.288
Woman: I think we
have a good shot.

04:05.375 --> 04:06.768
I mean, that had to
be morning sickness.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.075
It's time.

04:17.213 --> 04:19.214
Maybe it was just that bad
Thai food from last night.

04:20.476 --> 04:21.391
Yeah.

04:21.478 --> 04:25.090
Mark, wait! Let's
talk about this.

04:25.221 --> 04:27.919
It's my fault.
We both know it.

04:28.006 --> 04:30.270
Hey! It's no one's fault.

04:35.013 --> 04:38.669
So, how do you feel
about finally starting

04:38.800 --> 04:40.932
your new dream job?

04:41.063 --> 04:42.412
I'm kinda anxious
about having to start

04:42.543 --> 04:44.806
in the middle of
the school year.

04:44.893 --> 04:50.812
Look. Don't stress.
You're gonna be amazing.

05:12.137 --> 05:14.488
Callie, you talked
to Nicolette today?

05:14.575 --> 05:15.445
She's not
answering my texts

05:15.576 --> 05:17.621
and she's supposed
to be home by now.

05:17.752 --> 05:20.537
-No. Maybe she stayed late at
school for tutoring though.

05:20.624 --> 05:22.974
-The school called. She was
absent for most of the day.

05:25.499 --> 05:28.371
As soon as you hear
from Nicolette,

05:28.457 --> 05:29.677
tell her I wanna
speak with her.

05:43.386 --> 05:46.868
Nicolette. Nicolette, sweetie,

05:46.955 --> 05:50.393
we talked about this.
You can't skip school.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.221
You're gonna end up getting
a suspension if you do.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.049
-I'm not gonna stop until
I find out what happened

05:54.179 --> 05:56.356
to Brooke. I don't
care what it takes.

05:56.443 --> 05:59.271
-If you miss class
again, unexcused,

05:59.359 --> 06:02.362
the principal is going to
be on the phone with me.

06:02.449 --> 06:05.190
As long as you live here,
I'm responsible for you!

06:07.541 --> 06:08.977
OK.

06:18.682 --> 06:19.509
Nicolette: I still
feel so guilty

06:19.596 --> 06:20.815
that I missed her
call, Vanesha.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.123
I can't shake the feeling
that something horrible's

06:25.210 --> 06:27.691
happened to Brooke.

06:27.778 --> 06:31.173
Brooke has never given up
on me since we were twelve.

06:31.303 --> 06:32.870
I'm not gonna give up on her.

06:33.001 --> 06:35.133
She's been gone for three days.

06:35.264 --> 06:37.788
Well, then she'll probably
turn up any time now.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.573
Remember when she disappeared
from the group home?

06:39.703 --> 06:41.096
Only to find out she
ran off with Trent

06:41.226 --> 06:42.837
to be at his family's
place in Idaho.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.012
We were worried over nothin'.

06:44.142 --> 06:46.841
I know. But this time
it just feels different.

06:46.971 --> 06:49.147
Maybe Trent caught up with
her as soon as she got here.

06:49.278 --> 06:51.628
I mean she's what, nine
months pregnant by now?

06:51.759 --> 06:52.760
Where would she go?

06:59.680 --> 07:00.420
You OK?

07:04.075 --> 07:06.774
Yeah, uh, I'm fine.

07:06.861 --> 07:10.560
It's nothing. Let's
just go inside.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.344
So, Sandy, you
ready for this?

07:12.432 --> 07:14.259
As ready as I'll
ever be, Madeline.

07:14.346 --> 07:16.305
Are you regretting this
change of career yet?

07:16.392 --> 07:17.437
Missed your days
as an accountant?

07:20.091 --> 07:21.136
What's this?

07:23.530 --> 07:24.922
Oh. Brooke Summers
was a student

07:25.053 --> 07:26.315
who disappeared
months ago.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.360
Some of the students
had put those up.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.450
But then the girl calls her
friends after three weeks

07:30.580 --> 07:32.234
to let them know that
she actually ran off

07:32.364 --> 07:34.149
with a boyfriend.

07:34.279 --> 07:36.238
Such a shame. Brooke
had lots of potential.

07:39.415 --> 07:40.677
Sandy: Everyone take
a seat, please.

07:47.379 --> 07:50.470
Oh! Tardy on the new
teacher's first day I see.

07:50.557 --> 07:53.385
Yeah, sorry. Traffic.
You know how it is.

07:53.516 --> 07:55.257
Jake Hamilton, here.

07:58.869 --> 08:02.351
Welcome, everyone. I'm Ms.
Ridling. I'll be taking over

08:02.438 --> 08:05.876
for Ms. Jenkins' eleventh-grade
English classes.

08:05.963 --> 08:08.923
I assume everyone kept up
with the readings assigned

08:09.053 --> 08:13.101
by Ms. Jenkins before she left
and are ready to talk about

08:13.188 --> 08:14.363
Fitzgerald's classic...

08:15.407 --> 08:16.321
The Great Gatsby.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.847
Who can tell me the name of
the narrator of the novel?

08:27.158 --> 08:28.159
In the back?

08:31.380 --> 08:33.164
What's your name?

08:33.251 --> 08:34.426
It's Nicolette.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.211
Well, Nicolette, you
know the school's policy

08:36.341 --> 08:37.995
on cellphones in
class, correct?

08:40.998 --> 08:42.739
Phone, please.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.785
You can get it at the end
of the day in the office.

09:25.869 --> 09:28.916
There you are! You missed
our entire first class.

09:29.003 --> 09:32.136
Yeah. OK, lady. I've
got bigger fish to fry.

09:32.223 --> 09:35.270
Are you OK? You
don't look well.

09:35.357 --> 09:37.489
Is it a stomach
bug or the flu?

09:37.620 --> 09:39.317
Don't worry about it.

09:39.448 --> 09:40.449
Or is it something else?

09:44.235 --> 09:45.759
Can I get you anything or...

09:45.846 --> 09:47.935
Can you leave me alone?

09:48.065 --> 09:50.111
I'll be back this
afternoon for the nurse.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.678
Your stuff is still in
the classroom on my desk...

09:51.765 --> 09:54.463
OK! I'll go get it!

10:14.701 --> 10:18.356
Please!
Help! The baby's coming!

10:18.443 --> 10:20.576
I need you to keep breathing,
honey. Not yet, OK?

10:22.752 --> 10:25.581
I changed my
mind! I wanna keep my baby!

10:25.668 --> 10:28.323
That is not an
option, Brooke!

10:28.453 --> 10:31.152
Not now. You made
an agreement.

10:31.239 --> 10:34.982
I'll go to the police! I'll
tell them what you do here!

10:49.823 --> 10:50.345
Excuse me,
Nicolette!

10:52.913 --> 10:54.654
What do you
want this time?

10:54.741 --> 10:56.220
Are you feeling
any better?

10:56.307 --> 10:59.397
I'm fine. It's none
of your business.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.617
Go be a good-doer
somewhere else.

11:01.704 --> 11:02.966
Uh, Nicolette?

11:04.489 --> 11:06.578
If you need
someone to talk to

11:06.666 --> 11:10.670
about your possible
situation, I'm here.

11:10.757 --> 11:15.283
Listen, Miss Suburbia.
I highly doubt you have

11:15.370 --> 11:17.851
any clue of what I'm
going though right now.

11:25.162 --> 11:27.034
That one can be a challenge.

11:27.121 --> 11:29.558
Smart but not focused,
to say the least.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.603
Kind of like I
was at her age.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.388
Oh, and she's the one whose
friend went missing, too.

11:33.518 --> 11:35.346
There's always a lot
going on with her,

11:35.433 --> 11:36.739
so don't take
it personally.

11:53.016 --> 11:55.192
Where's my baby?

11:55.279 --> 11:58.065
Please
don't do this!

11:58.195 --> 11:59.893
The boss has already
given her to a new couple.

12:07.030 --> 12:10.338
I don't want
your money, just my baby!

12:10.425 --> 12:12.688
I should have never
come back here!

12:12.819 --> 12:15.430
You are gonna dig yourself
into a grave, young lady,

12:15.517 --> 12:19.086
if you don't get into
line. You hear me?

12:33.840 --> 12:35.842
So what are you gonna
do if you are pregnant?

12:35.972 --> 12:39.367
I don't know. I, I thought
that we were careful.

12:39.454 --> 12:41.456
Famous last
words, man.

12:41.586 --> 12:43.371
Nothing in this world's
a hundred percent.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.286
I mean, first Brooke.
Now maybe you.

12:45.415 --> 12:46.940
I might just stay
celibate till I'm forty.

12:47.027 --> 12:50.073
Mm-hm.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.336
I mean, I don't, I
don't know what I'm gonna do.

12:52.467 --> 12:56.906
I finally had like a plan:
go to nursing school,

12:56.993 --> 12:59.474
have a life of my own finally.

12:59.561 --> 13:01.911
Hm. Is it, uh...

13:01.998 --> 13:09.876
-Jake's? Yeah. And he's barely
talked to me since. Yeah.

13:10.006 --> 13:14.794
Oh! Speaking of, I'm gonna go
talk to him. I'll be back.

13:14.924 --> 13:18.058
Jake? Jake, I need
to talk to you!

13:18.188 --> 13:19.711
I didn't think we had
anything else to talk about,

13:19.842 --> 13:21.104
Nicolette. I'm seeing
someone else now.

13:21.191 --> 13:23.498
I know. I heard the gossip.
You're dating that new girl

13:23.628 --> 13:26.762
from the pricey private
school uptown, right?

13:26.893 --> 13:29.678
Listen, it's
nothing against you.

13:29.765 --> 13:31.462
It's just...things
just didn't work out.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.685
Do you wanna know why I was
sick this morning in class?

13:36.772 --> 13:37.991
I don't care. It's
not my business.

13:46.042 --> 13:50.568
No, you're, you're lying,
right? You're joking?

13:50.699 --> 13:53.833
Well, I don't know
yet, but if I am?

13:57.532 --> 14:00.622
You're lying. I
don't have time for this.

14:21.643 --> 14:23.384
You need to eat and hydrate

14:23.471 --> 14:26.169
if you're gonna get
your energy back.

14:26.256 --> 14:28.476
The boss said she'll buy you
a bus ticket to Los Angeles.

14:28.563 --> 14:31.044
Isn't that nice?

14:31.174 --> 14:32.436
You know, you can
take that money

14:32.567 --> 14:36.136
that she gave you and start
over with a brand-new life.

14:38.834 --> 14:41.402
She even knows someone
who can give a job

14:41.532 --> 14:44.927
to a young pretty
girl like yourself.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.018
You have no idea how
lucky you really are.

15:01.552 --> 15:03.772
Please, can you
get it for me?

15:03.859 --> 15:04.904
I don't have
the strength.

15:19.396 --> 15:20.267
Brooke?

15:22.399 --> 15:24.010
Brooke!

15:32.540 --> 15:35.717
Brooke! Come back here!

16:01.264 --> 16:02.309
Where the hell's the girl?

16:02.439 --> 16:05.616
She escaped! She,
she took my phone!

16:05.703 --> 16:06.922
Where'd she go?

16:07.009 --> 16:09.664
I, I don't know!
Gimme your phone!

16:09.794 --> 16:11.144
I can track mine if
she tries to use it!

16:23.156 --> 16:25.332
I can't believe you're still
here! It's almost seven!

16:25.419 --> 16:28.944
I'm just trying to get as much
prep work done as I can.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.990
Get outta here! The rest
can wait till tomorrow.

16:31.120 --> 16:31.860
I promise.

16:32.992 --> 16:33.688
Good night.

16:45.917 --> 16:49.269
You're still here?
School ended hours ago.

16:49.399 --> 16:50.705
Great observation,
Sherlock.

16:52.533 --> 16:53.838
Well, if the nurse
isn't here by now

16:53.925 --> 16:57.755
Yeah, I know. The office told
me that she had to come by

16:57.842 --> 16:59.453
to drop something off
before the school locked up

16:59.583 --> 17:00.454
at the end of the day.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.631
I probably
shouldn't do this

17:06.155 --> 17:07.983
But I have a
master key.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.402
Hm. You're in luck.
Here you go.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.405
She keeps it just
under the counter.

17:38.492 --> 17:40.668
I'm sure she won't
mind if you take one.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.278
Why are you helping me?

17:42.409 --> 17:44.411
Look, I know we don't know
each other very well but--

17:44.541 --> 17:46.587
No, you don't know me at all.

17:46.717 --> 17:47.936
I remember what it's
like to be a teen.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.593
Spare me! I hate it when
adults say they remember

17:52.723 --> 17:54.856
what it was like when
they were my age,

17:54.986 --> 17:57.076
when you have no idea
what I've been through!

18:01.993 --> 18:07.521
Look. I appreciate everything
that you've done for me, OK?

18:07.651 --> 18:09.218
Just I can take it from here.

18:12.482 --> 18:13.701
Nicolette.

18:41.946 --> 18:42.947
Are you OK?

18:47.213 --> 18:48.779
I took a pregnancy
test and it's positive.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.438
I might have some insight into
your situation, you know.

18:55.525 --> 18:57.136
How?

18:59.790 --> 19:00.835
I got pregnant
when I was sixteen.

19:04.491 --> 19:06.536
Really?

19:06.623 --> 19:10.540
It's true. I had just
finished my sophomore year.

19:10.671 --> 19:16.067
And my boyfriend and I,
well, we weren't careful.

19:16.198 --> 19:18.809
And my parents,
well, let's just say

19:18.896 --> 19:20.681
they were not thrilled.

19:22.813 --> 19:25.294
They were worried about
keeping up appearances

19:25.381 --> 19:28.384
because of my father's
job, so they sent me

19:28.515 --> 19:30.952
across the country to
live with my grandparents.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.606
Told everybody I was
studying in Europe.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.350
I put the baby
up for adoption.

19:40.309 --> 19:41.441
I didn't even get a
chance to hold her.

19:43.878 --> 19:45.053
I couldn't handle
it at the time.

19:47.098 --> 19:48.752
And then when I came
back, my parents and I

19:48.839 --> 19:52.103
just never spoke
about it.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.714
That relationship has
been distant ever since.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.762
So I may be
Miss Suburbia,

19:58.893 --> 20:00.634
but I might have some idea of
what you're going through.

20:02.853 --> 20:03.550
Maybe.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.816
I
have to head home.

20:13.124 --> 20:17.259
But remember my offer if
you need someone to talk to.

20:34.581 --> 20:35.277
Hello?

20:35.408 --> 20:36.496
Nicolette, It's me!

20:36.583 --> 20:37.888
Oh, my God! Brooke?

20:38.019 --> 20:39.934
OK, listen carefully! I
don't have much time.

20:40.021 --> 20:41.675
There's this woman named Abigal

20:41.805 --> 20:44.068
and she's after me and
my baby is missing!

20:44.155 --> 20:45.679
OK, meet me at our
spot in twenty minutes!

20:45.766 --> 20:47.463
Wait! Brooke, where are you?

20:47.594 --> 20:48.856
Nicolette?

20:48.943 --> 20:50.161
Brooke!

21:14.360 --> 21:14.969
Brooke!

21:22.150 --> 21:24.152
Brooke! Watch out!

21:48.132 --> 21:49.003
You all right?

21:58.534 --> 22:00.884
Nicolette! Oh, my
God! Are you OK?

22:00.971 --> 22:01.972
Hardly.

22:03.234 --> 22:04.932
Officer: We'll talk more.

22:05.019 --> 22:06.673
Give me a call if you
remember anything new,

22:06.803 --> 22:08.631
day or night, OK?
Here's my card.

22:16.552 --> 22:20.077
I still can't process
all that's happened.

22:20.164 --> 22:21.165
I'm Detective Holmes
with homicide.

22:23.777 --> 22:27.171
Do you think what happened to
Brooke wasn't an accident?

22:27.258 --> 22:29.826
According to Nicolette, the
car that struck her friend

22:29.957 --> 22:32.046
was aiming right for her.

22:32.176 --> 22:35.049
Did Nicolette see
who was driving?

22:35.136 --> 22:37.486
She couldn't recall any
identifying features

22:37.573 --> 22:40.794
on the driver. We'll be back.

22:40.881 --> 22:43.100
She might remember
details later.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.891
Hey! Where you been? Got the
history notes from class?

23:09.257 --> 23:10.563
Brooke's dead.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.042
-What?

23:32.062 --> 23:34.543
Sandy: And then, in my
fourth period class,

23:34.630 --> 23:38.504
two boys decided to
fight over the same girl.

23:38.634 --> 23:42.203
I swear, so much in this
job has nothing to do

23:42.290 --> 23:44.118
with actually
teaching English.

23:45.946 --> 23:48.862
You can do anything
you set your mind to,

23:48.949 --> 23:50.951
and you've been wanting
to teach for years now.

23:52.518 --> 23:53.562
You'll start getting
the hang of this whole

23:53.693 --> 23:56.086
classroom
management thing.

23:56.217 --> 23:57.131
Well, I hope
you're right.

23:57.261 --> 23:58.001
I am.

24:00.134 --> 24:02.179
You know my
student, Nicolette,

24:02.310 --> 24:03.616
the one I told you
I was worried about?

24:03.703 --> 24:05.444
Yeah.

24:05.531 --> 24:09.012
Well, turns out
she's pregnant.

24:09.099 --> 24:10.231
I actually went into
the nurse's office

24:10.361 --> 24:14.714
to get her a test. I
just hope she talks to me

24:14.801 --> 24:16.150
if she needs
someone to lean on.

24:18.282 --> 24:20.981
She's quite the
firecracker.

24:21.068 --> 24:23.462
I have some
news on my end.

24:23.549 --> 24:25.202
What is it?

24:25.333 --> 24:29.032
Our new VP at work,
Gil, asked me to, uh,

24:29.119 --> 24:32.035
travel to Charleston
for a few weeks.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.037
Construction on a new
hotel there's a mess

24:34.124 --> 24:35.691
and he wants me
to oversee things,

24:35.822 --> 24:37.476
so I have to leave
tomorrow morning.

24:38.781 --> 24:40.043
A few weeks?

24:40.130 --> 24:41.871
Yes. I know. I'm not
thrilled about it either,

24:42.002 --> 24:45.005
but I need Gil on my
side if I wanna move up.

24:47.137 --> 24:49.357
I understand.

24:49.444 --> 24:50.880
I'll make it up to
you when I come back.

24:51.925 --> 24:52.665
I promise.

24:55.102 --> 24:56.799
You better.

25:03.806 --> 25:07.593
Why couldn't she have
just kept her mouth shut?

25:07.680 --> 25:08.637
You're lucky I
found her at all.

25:12.162 --> 25:13.337
Did we really
have to kill her?

25:22.521 --> 25:23.870
I just can't stop
thinking about her.

25:26.307 --> 25:27.874
I'm so sorry about
Brooke, Nicolette.

25:30.267 --> 25:31.704
She was always
really nice to me.

25:36.578 --> 25:38.711
What could've happened
to Brooke's baby though?

25:38.798 --> 25:40.800
It doesn't make any sense.

25:48.111 --> 25:49.939
It's Rachel. What
does she want now?

25:50.026 --> 25:51.288
She just wants to
make sure you're OK.

25:51.419 --> 25:52.942
She's worried about you.

25:53.073 --> 25:54.204
Yeah. It's a little too
late, don't you think?

26:04.650 --> 26:07.827
Hi, Nicolette. Why
don't you have a seat?

26:13.441 --> 26:16.183
I can't imagine what
you've been through.

26:16.313 --> 26:21.449
Brooke was a great girl and
I know you two were close.

26:21.536 --> 26:23.973
I want you to know that
you can come and talk to me

26:24.104 --> 26:28.543
anytime you need to.
Stress can take a toll,

26:28.630 --> 26:30.284
and I've heard through the
grapevine that you've been

26:30.414 --> 26:32.634
waking up sick the
past few mornings.

26:32.765 --> 26:35.463
Do we really have to
talk about this now?

26:35.550 --> 26:37.900
Because I'm pretty messed
up after what I just saw.

26:37.987 --> 26:40.381
I know, sweetie. But if
you've found yourself

26:40.468 --> 26:44.820
in a delicate situation,
you can come to me for help.

26:44.907 --> 26:46.300
That's why I'm here.

26:46.430 --> 26:49.129
No one can help
me with this.

26:49.216 --> 26:53.089
I have seen a lot in my
years here, Nicolette,

26:53.176 --> 26:55.744
and I know when the signs are
pointing to one of my girls

26:55.831 --> 27:01.184
being pregnant. I knew
it about Brooke, too.

27:01.315 --> 27:03.447
Are you pregnant?

27:09.323 --> 27:12.456
Well, if you are, I'd
like to introduce you

27:12.543 --> 27:15.634
to someone who I
think can assist.

27:15.721 --> 27:19.202
She's an amazing woman who's
worked with girls in the past

27:19.289 --> 27:21.422
in a similar dilemma.

27:21.509 --> 27:24.251
After you've taken the
time to process your grief

27:24.338 --> 27:25.992
about Brooke, of course,

27:28.690 --> 27:29.517
I'll make it
through.

27:32.215 --> 27:33.956
I always do.

27:47.056 --> 27:49.276
Nothing as fun as an
early morning flight.

27:49.363 --> 27:51.408
You got everything? Did
you remember clean socks?

27:51.495 --> 27:53.802
Oh, damn! See, I knew
I forgot something.

27:55.325 --> 27:57.371
Yes, babe, I
remembered clean socks.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.112
Well, I had to
ask, you know,

27:59.242 --> 28:01.636
after that meeting you had
in San Francisco where you

28:01.723 --> 28:04.421
Didn't realize I
forgot clean socks

28:04.508 --> 28:06.685
ten minutes before going
into a meeting. Yes. Yes.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.601
I'll miss you.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.082
I hate leaving you the
first week of your new job.

28:13.213 --> 28:14.388
I'll be fine.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.173
All right.

28:22.875 --> 28:24.311
Mark?

28:24.398 --> 28:26.095
Yeah?

28:26.182 --> 28:28.924
I had a thought
on my run.

28:29.055 --> 28:30.883
Uh, maybe we can talk
to that IVF specialist

28:30.970 --> 28:34.277
that your co-worker used. I
mean, it's, it's worth a shot

28:34.408 --> 28:37.324
just to get some information
about it, right?

28:37.454 --> 28:40.893
OK. Um, how 'bout we talk
about that when I come back?

28:40.980 --> 28:42.198
OK.

28:55.298 --> 28:56.430
What does he want?

29:00.869 --> 29:02.610
You don't have to talk to
him if you don't want to.

29:07.658 --> 29:08.747
I'll be right back.

29:16.624 --> 29:19.670
So, now you wanna talk?

29:19.758 --> 29:22.195
Look, I just heard
about Brooke.

29:22.325 --> 29:25.111
Is it true that you saw
when she got hit by a car?

29:26.895 --> 29:29.245
Yeah. It's true.

29:29.376 --> 29:30.943
I'm sorry to hear that.

29:33.032 --> 29:33.772
What do you
want, Jake?

29:35.948 --> 29:37.776
I just have to
know. Are you...?

29:37.863 --> 29:41.910
Pregnant? Yeah, I'm pregnant!

29:41.997 --> 29:44.347
Please, just lower
your voice, for me.

29:44.478 --> 29:45.305
Go to hell, Jake!

29:47.263 --> 29:50.223
Please.

29:50.353 --> 29:53.356
I talked to my mom about
you maybe being pregnant.

29:53.487 --> 29:57.317
You did? Well, I can't
imagine what she said.

29:57.447 --> 30:00.450
She's not really a big
fan of mine, right?

30:00.581 --> 30:01.712
Sorry that you
got the girl

30:01.800 --> 30:05.151
from the wrong side of the
tracks pregnant, rich boy.

30:05.281 --> 30:08.589
She wants to make
an arrangement. OK?

30:08.719 --> 30:11.070
Just all you have to do is
sign a couple of documents

30:11.157 --> 30:12.636
that her lawyer draws
up and we'll be good.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.334
What do you mean
'an arrangement'?

30:17.032 --> 30:19.687
It's money, Nicolette,

30:19.774 --> 30:23.560
to do whatever, whatever
option you wanna do.

30:23.691 --> 30:25.040
So you really think that
throwing money at this

30:25.127 --> 30:27.129
situation is gonna
make things better,

30:27.216 --> 30:28.348
it's gonna solve things?

30:28.435 --> 30:29.828
No, but...
-This is your kid!

30:33.962 --> 30:35.311
I'm sorry. It's the
best I can do right now.

30:47.584 --> 30:50.152
According to her
social worker,

30:50.283 --> 30:53.155
Brooke last lived here five
months ago. Is that correct?

30:53.286 --> 30:55.984
Yes. From what
I understand,

30:56.071 --> 30:58.682
she ran off with
her boyfriend.

30:58.769 --> 31:01.337
I think the girls said
his name was Trent.

31:01.424 --> 31:02.382
We'll look into
her boyfriend.

31:05.037 --> 31:09.258
She turned eighteen, so
there wasn't anything

31:09.345 --> 31:11.043
we could do when she left.

31:12.783 --> 31:16.744
It's unfortunate, but
sometimes our girls

31:16.831 --> 31:19.094
don't make the
best decisions.

31:19.225 --> 31:21.575
-One thing we didn't expect
is we found an envelope

31:21.705 --> 31:24.578
with a large amount
of cash on her body.

31:24.708 --> 31:25.884
Oh, really?

31:25.971 --> 31:27.624
We're still unsure how
a girl in her situation

31:27.711 --> 31:29.409
would have that
much cash on her.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.863
Nicolette, do you
have a second?

31:51.344 --> 31:53.085
The girl who
died...Brooke,

31:55.522 --> 31:56.740
She was your
friend, wasn't she?

32:00.744 --> 32:01.615
I'm so sorry.

32:04.052 --> 32:05.140
Nicolette: Every time
I close my eyes,

32:05.227 --> 32:10.624
I just see the car heading
straight towards Brooke.

32:10.711 --> 32:13.453
And between that and
having my life upended,

32:13.540 --> 32:17.109
finding out that I'm
pregnant, I mean...

32:17.196 --> 32:18.588
I've been living at a
depressing group home

32:18.675 --> 32:21.243
for two years. What
can I do with a child?

32:21.374 --> 32:23.071
What do I have to offer it?

32:23.158 --> 32:23.811
What about
your family?

32:26.248 --> 32:29.121
I've never met my
dad. And my mom...

32:31.471 --> 32:34.039
there were lots of men.

32:34.169 --> 32:37.129
She got addicted to
prescription pain medication

32:39.827 --> 32:42.873
and then CPS came by once one
of the neighbors found out

32:42.961 --> 32:45.964
that, um, I'd been spending
most of my nights alone.

32:48.270 --> 32:50.664
So I had nowhere
else to go.

32:50.751 --> 32:52.231
That's how I ended up
at the group home.

32:52.361 --> 32:55.060
I'm so sorry, Nicolette.

32:55.147 --> 32:56.452
Someone your age
should never have to go

32:56.583 --> 32:57.932
through something
like that.

32:58.063 --> 33:00.413
Yeah, well, it's
just my reality.

33:04.069 --> 33:07.724
Do um... do you ever
think about the baby

33:07.855 --> 33:09.291
that you put up
for adoption?

33:11.685 --> 33:12.599
Every day.

33:15.732 --> 33:20.346
But I have no doubt I made the
right decision for my child.

33:20.433 --> 33:22.348
I knew I was not
ready to be a mother.

33:25.307 --> 33:27.440
Is that what you're thinking
for your child, adoption?

33:27.527 --> 33:28.658
Maybe.

33:29.920 --> 33:30.704
Can I give you some advice?

33:33.837 --> 33:37.232
Take your time with
this decision, OK?

33:37.363 --> 33:40.061
Don't rush into it. I
probably would have chosen

33:40.192 --> 33:44.457
adoption regardless but I
wish I'd taken more time

33:44.544 --> 33:47.416
to come to that conclusion.

33:47.503 --> 33:50.811
And if you ever need to
talk about it or anything,

33:50.898 --> 33:52.378
let me know, OK?

33:55.163 --> 34:00.038
Yeah. Thanks for taking
the time to talk to me.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.911
A lot of adults just
see me as a problem

34:03.998 --> 34:07.567
that they need to deal with.

34:07.697 --> 34:10.047
I guess that's why I
act the way that I do.

34:10.178 --> 34:14.661
I mean, why try to be
different or better

34:14.791 --> 34:17.446
if everyone has low
expectations for you anyways?

34:17.533 --> 34:21.885
Oh, honey, you are
a great kid

34:22.016 --> 34:24.366
who's just in a
tough situation. OK?

34:24.453 --> 34:26.150
Don't let it define
the rest of your life.

34:28.804 --> 34:33.201
My friend, Brooke, she
ran away just after

34:33.331 --> 34:36.596
she got pregnant and then
showed up back in town

34:36.726 --> 34:39.773
five months later,
where she died.

34:39.860 --> 34:41.775
What happened to the baby?

34:41.862 --> 34:44.255
I don't know, but
she definitely

34:44.342 --> 34:45.866
wasn't pregnant
anymore when I saw her.

34:48.650 --> 34:50.000
Let me see your phone.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.306
Why?

34:52.393 --> 34:53.569
Just trust me.

35:01.490 --> 35:05.277
I'm gonna put in my number.
You can call me anytime, OK?

35:08.584 --> 35:09.977
I hope they find out what
happened to your friend.

35:14.982 --> 35:16.157
Oh no!

35:16.288 --> 35:17.245
Are you OK?

35:20.248 --> 35:23.904
Yeah. I'm just
realizing that uh...

35:26.820 --> 35:29.214
morning sickness happens-

35:29.301 --> 35:30.780
it can hit you
twenty-four/seven.

35:33.522 --> 35:34.219
I'll make you a deal.

35:37.047 --> 35:41.661
Both the group home and the
drug store are on my way home.

35:41.748 --> 35:46.013
If you promise to study
for your Great Gatsby quiz,

35:46.100 --> 35:47.101
I'll bring you
something to deal with

35:47.188 --> 35:48.494
your morning
sickness.

35:54.021 --> 35:56.284
Sometimes people just
wanna be nice, Nicolette.

36:09.645 --> 36:10.864
Rachel: She just
found out so...

36:12.300 --> 36:13.171
here she is.

36:14.607 --> 36:17.740
Nicolette, could I see you
in my office, please?

36:17.871 --> 36:18.872
Just for a minute.

36:23.311 --> 36:25.705
Abigail: Here she is!
Nicolette.

36:25.835 --> 36:26.967
I'm Abigail.

36:27.097 --> 36:29.578
I've so been looking
forward to meeting you.

36:29.709 --> 36:31.363
And I am really sorry to
hear about what happened

36:31.450 --> 36:34.061
to your friend.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.889
Rachel: Why don't I give
you two some alone time

36:35.976 --> 36:37.195
so you can get acquainted?

36:39.066 --> 36:40.067
Would that be all right
with you, Nicolette?

36:44.114 --> 36:47.161
Well then, I'll be outside.

36:47.292 --> 36:48.641
Thank you,
Rachel, for this

36:48.728 --> 36:50.208
and everything you
do for all the girls.

36:53.123 --> 36:58.085
Now Nicolette, Rachel told me
that you recently found out

36:58.172 --> 37:00.435
you're pregnant.

37:00.566 --> 37:03.177
I know that this can
be a very scary

37:03.264 --> 37:08.313
and unsettling time for you,
especially a girl your age.

37:08.400 --> 37:13.753
What's your deal?
What do you want?

37:13.883 --> 37:17.713
I like that:
straight to business.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.977
I happen to run one of
the most prestigious

37:21.108 --> 37:23.545
private adoption
agencies in the state

37:23.632 --> 37:27.027
and our prospective parents
are amazingly pedigreed.

37:27.114 --> 37:29.638
They are highly
educated, professional,

37:29.769 --> 37:32.946
and very well off. They're
willing to compensate.

37:33.033 --> 37:34.904
Are you saying that
you wanna sell my baby?

37:34.991 --> 37:38.473
That would
be illegal.

37:38.560 --> 37:41.824
But it is quite common, and
legal, for many parents

37:41.911 --> 37:45.698
to pay for the living
expenses or to put together

37:45.828 --> 37:48.527
a little trust fund for
your college expenses.

37:48.614 --> 37:52.313
You see, private adoption's
not just a loving choice

37:52.400 --> 37:55.055
for your baby but it's
a good choice to carve

37:55.142 --> 37:58.232
a positive path forward for you.

37:58.363 --> 38:01.366
Would you mind if we go over
the particulars together?

38:06.936 --> 38:11.941
So this is a lot to
take in and I'm sure

38:12.028 --> 38:14.117
that you will have
many questions.

38:14.204 --> 38:17.643
I expect that and that
is perfectly normal.

38:17.730 --> 38:20.298
This has my cellphone
number on it.

38:20.385 --> 38:23.866
You can call me anytime. And
trust me when I tell you,

38:23.953 --> 38:26.086
you are making the
best choice

38:26.216 --> 38:28.697
when you're considering
adoption for your child.

38:33.180 --> 38:34.573
How are things going?

38:34.660 --> 38:37.402
Well, I think she has
a lot to consider,

38:37.532 --> 38:39.447
but Nicolette is
a smart girl.

38:54.723 --> 38:55.724
Hi.

38:55.811 --> 38:56.638
Hi.

38:59.946 --> 39:01.339
Here ya go.

39:01.426 --> 39:02.557
Thanks!

39:03.863 --> 39:04.820
It's just some
ginger candies

39:04.907 --> 39:07.432
that my cousin swore by
when she was pregnant.

39:07.519 --> 39:09.738
Thanks. This
means a lot.

39:09.825 --> 39:10.696
It's no big
deal.

39:10.826 --> 39:12.741
Like I said, this
place is on my way.

39:12.828 --> 39:14.134
How are you feeling?

39:16.136 --> 39:16.963
It's been a lot.

39:18.747 --> 39:20.401
A woman from the adoption
agency just came by

39:20.488 --> 39:22.055
to talk to me.

39:22.185 --> 39:22.969
She did?

39:23.056 --> 39:24.536
Yeah.

39:25.972 --> 39:26.712
Rachel: May I help you?

39:28.409 --> 39:31.064
This is my English
teacher, Ms. Ridling.

39:31.151 --> 39:33.022
She just came by to
drop something off.

39:33.109 --> 39:35.547
Well, that was
nice of her.

39:35.634 --> 39:39.072
This is Rachel. She
runs the group home.

39:39.202 --> 39:41.770
And this is Abigail. She
runs the adoption agency.

39:41.857 --> 39:43.076
It's so nice to meet you.

39:43.163 --> 39:46.862
It's wonderful to see
such a dedicated educator.

39:46.949 --> 39:49.474
Nice to meet you too.

39:49.604 --> 39:52.390
Well, I guess I'll be going.
Nicolette, we'll talk soon.

40:06.752 --> 40:08.667
Is it normal for the
manager here to refer girls

40:08.797 --> 40:11.321
to a specific
adoption agency?

40:11.452 --> 40:15.151
I don't know. But, um...

40:15.238 --> 40:19.068
I do remember Brooke
talking about adoption but...

40:19.155 --> 40:21.114
But, what?

40:21.201 --> 40:24.770
It was painful for her to
talk about her pregnancy.

40:24.900 --> 40:26.162
It was the first
time where I felt

40:26.249 --> 40:28.556
a lot of distance
between us.

40:28.643 --> 40:30.253
And, God, now I
really understand

40:30.384 --> 40:31.429
what she was
going through.

40:33.996 --> 40:37.435
I finally had a
plan for my life.

40:37.565 --> 40:39.306
Kinda wanted to be a
nurse, help people.

40:41.351 --> 40:45.617
You still can, Nicolette.
It may sound cliché,

40:45.747 --> 40:48.489
but it's true. Where there's
a will, there's a way.

41:00.675 --> 41:03.417
I can't believe that this is
all we have left of Brooke.

41:03.548 --> 41:04.940
It's only 'cause she forgot it.

41:10.163 --> 41:12.339
We made this in sixth-grade
art class together.

41:19.738 --> 41:22.741
What is it gonna take for
people to actually care about

41:22.871 --> 41:24.482
what happens to kids like us?

41:29.356 --> 41:31.445
I'm gonna find out what
happened to Brooke.

41:47.592 --> 41:51.247
Claudia's in your office.
You need to talk to her.

41:51.378 --> 41:53.423
I saw she bought a plane
ticket on her phone.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.382
Another problem.
We're starting to get

41:55.513 --> 41:59.081
way too many of
those in this city.

41:59.168 --> 42:01.344
I want you to start following
the Nicolette girl,

42:01.475 --> 42:03.695
find out where she goes. It
could be useful information

42:03.782 --> 42:05.348
for us in the very near future.

42:15.794 --> 42:18.710
Something wrong, Claudia?

42:18.840 --> 42:22.365
-I only took this job because
I desperately needed the cash

42:22.496 --> 42:26.282
to help pay for my mother's
experimental cancer treatments.

42:26.413 --> 42:33.289
But, uh, it doesn't
always feel... right.

42:33.420 --> 42:36.031
Keeping some of these
girls locked up and

42:36.118 --> 42:38.294
No one is locked up.

42:38.425 --> 42:41.776
They are simply detained
until they give birth.

42:41.863 --> 42:48.174
I know. It's just, uh
It's just a lot.

42:48.261 --> 42:49.392
I know.

42:52.831 --> 42:56.617
Why don't you go home
and get some rest?

42:56.704 --> 42:58.445
Everything will look
brighter tomorrow.

42:58.576 --> 43:02.536
OK.

44:12.214 --> 44:13.781
Hey.

44:13.868 --> 44:14.782
Alex! What are you-

44:14.869 --> 44:16.001
I think you know why
I'm here, Claudia.

44:18.438 --> 44:20.048
You're just a liability now.

44:25.271 --> 44:26.968
Nicolette: There it goes.

44:27.055 --> 44:28.491
A message to Brooke's

44:28.578 --> 44:30.624
good-for-nothing
boyfriend, Trent.

44:30.755 --> 44:31.669
I thought you
said Trent

44:31.756 --> 44:33.409
hasn't even been on
that site in years.

44:33.496 --> 44:34.759
I don't know. It's
worth a shot.

44:34.889 --> 44:36.674
Maybe he'll log back in.

44:36.761 --> 44:38.371
Maybe he has some information
on the investigation.

44:40.939 --> 44:43.202
Um, I'll see
you later.

44:43.332 --> 44:44.812
I, I gotta take
care of something.

44:51.123 --> 44:53.691
Hey, can I talk
to you? Now.

44:55.736 --> 44:56.868
Catch you later, man.

44:59.348 --> 45:00.872
What's up?

45:03.439 --> 45:05.311
I've been
thinking about

45:05.398 --> 45:06.834
putting the baby
up for adoption.

45:13.362 --> 45:14.537
OK.

45:19.891 --> 45:21.022
Sandy: Don't forget to
answer the questions

45:21.109 --> 45:23.633
at the end of chapter seven,
OK? Have a good evening!

45:23.721 --> 45:25.592
Sandy: Somebody did well
on their quiz.

45:25.679 --> 45:29.030
Uh, yeah. Those ginger
candies you got me for nausea

45:29.117 --> 45:30.423
helped me concentrate and study.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.427
Did you think more
about the meeting

45:34.514 --> 45:36.168
that you had
with that lady?

45:36.255 --> 45:38.431
Yeah, but, um, I,
I don't know yet.

45:42.217 --> 45:45.090
Again, take your time
with this decision.

45:47.832 --> 45:52.532
Would you have some time to
talk to me about it more?

45:52.662 --> 45:55.317
I just, I have some questions
about your experience.

45:55.448 --> 45:58.886
Sure. Did you wanna
grab a bite at the diner

45:58.973 --> 46:01.541
on Fifth Street? I have
a teacher meeting now,

46:01.628 --> 46:03.804
but I could meet you there
at seven-thirty. My treat!

46:03.891 --> 46:05.327
No. It's OK. You
don't have to do that.

46:05.458 --> 46:07.590
No, no, no. It's no big
deal. See you there?

46:09.854 --> 46:11.420
Yeah. I'll see you there.

46:23.868 --> 46:27.262
How are you, Nicolette? I
just wanted to touch base.

46:27.349 --> 46:29.308
I know how tough
things have been.

46:29.438 --> 46:31.397
That's an understatement
of the year.

46:31.484 --> 46:34.574
Well, we're having your
favorite for dinner tonight,

46:34.661 --> 46:38.752
pizza! That should put
a smile on your face.

46:38.839 --> 46:41.276
I'm actually going out
for dinner with someone.

46:41.363 --> 46:42.930
And who would that be?

46:43.061 --> 46:44.323
I won't be back late, OK?

47:01.296 --> 47:03.472
Oh, hey there!

47:03.559 --> 47:06.649
Hey. It's such a shame about
Brooke Summers. So young.

47:06.736 --> 47:08.695
I can't stop thinking
about the poor girl.

47:08.782 --> 47:12.177
Yeah, I know. It's horrible.
Nicolette's been very brave,

47:12.307 --> 47:14.440
considering how
close they were.

47:14.527 --> 47:16.094
I just hope they
find who did it.

48:17.198 --> 48:18.373
Agh!

48:31.778 --> 48:33.214
Hey, Nicolette. Sorry.

48:33.301 --> 48:34.955
I'm just running a
few minutes late.

48:35.042 --> 48:37.044
I've fallen! I'm scared I might
have hurt the baby!

48:37.131 --> 48:41.048
I'm at the parking lot
across from the diner.

48:41.179 --> 48:42.571
Stay there. I'm on my way!

48:53.800 --> 48:55.062
How's the baby?

48:55.149 --> 48:58.065
You're very lucky.
The baby is fine.

48:58.196 --> 49:00.502
You need to be careful.

49:00.589 --> 49:03.505
Since you did have some
spotting and cramping,

49:03.592 --> 49:06.334
I wanna keep you
overnight just in case.

49:06.421 --> 49:08.771
Was that your mom
in here earlier?

49:08.858 --> 49:11.078
Oh, no. That's
my teacher.

49:11.209 --> 49:13.254
She did the right thing
in rushing you here.

49:20.305 --> 49:22.220
Hey, hon.
- Hey!

49:22.307 --> 49:24.570
I just wanted to check
in and see if you were

49:24.700 --> 49:26.702
able to get us an
appointment with the doctor.

49:26.789 --> 49:30.706
Oh. Sorry. I've been a
little distracted lately.

49:30.837 --> 49:32.491
What's wrong?

49:32.621 --> 49:34.101
Well, you know my
student Nicolette

49:34.232 --> 49:35.363
that I told you about?

49:35.450 --> 49:37.017
Yeah.

49:37.104 --> 49:38.758
Well, she thinks she
was being followed

49:38.845 --> 49:40.978
and fell as she ran off.

49:41.065 --> 49:43.458
I brought her to the hospital
and she's with a doctor now.

49:43.589 --> 49:44.764
That's
terrible!

49:44.851 --> 49:47.767
I know. It is. This poor
girl has been through hell

49:47.854 --> 49:49.812
the past forty-eight hours and

49:51.814 --> 49:52.859
I can't shake the
feeling that...

49:54.339 --> 49:56.863
That?

49:56.994 --> 49:58.996
That something bad
is gonna happen.

50:03.348 --> 50:06.090
Nicolette! I got here
as fast as I could!

50:06.177 --> 50:07.352
Oh, you poor thing.

50:07.482 --> 50:09.528
I'm Dr. Gibbs.
And you are?

50:09.658 --> 50:11.704
I'm Rachel. I manage
the group home

50:11.834 --> 50:13.401
where Nicolette
currently lives.

50:13.488 --> 50:15.055
I should be her
emergency contact.

50:15.186 --> 50:17.144
Hm.

50:17.231 --> 50:20.408
Oh, Nicolette! You've been
through enough as it is.

50:20.539 --> 50:22.671
Dr. Gibb: Please talk
to the charge nurse

50:22.802 --> 50:25.544
so we can get
your information.

50:25.674 --> 50:28.286
And you need to get
some rest, young lady.

50:28.416 --> 50:29.678
I'll check on you later.

50:34.074 --> 50:36.772
I had just got a
call from Abigail

50:36.903 --> 50:39.558
from the adoption
agency before I got here.

50:39.645 --> 50:41.647
I told her what happened,
and she wants to come

50:41.734 --> 50:43.214
check in on you later.

50:44.519 --> 50:47.653
Yeah, I guess.

50:54.181 --> 50:55.617
Callie: Do you have any
news on Nicolette?

50:55.748 --> 50:59.447
Yeah. She stayed overnight
at the hospital.

50:59.578 --> 51:01.319
She was convinced someone
was following her.

51:01.406 --> 51:03.408
I don't know.

51:03.495 --> 51:06.237
So many crazy things have
been happening lately!

51:06.324 --> 51:07.977
What is it?

51:08.108 --> 51:10.284
Brooke's boyfriend
Trent just messaged me.

51:10.415 --> 51:13.113
He finally checked
the social media app.

51:13.200 --> 51:14.549
He's in town and he
wants to meet up.

51:24.559 --> 51:27.780
How did this happen to
Brooke? And where's my baby?

51:27.867 --> 51:29.477
You need to calm
down, Trent,

51:29.608 --> 51:30.609
if we're gonna figure
out what happened.

51:30.696 --> 51:32.045
I can't believe nobody
told me what happened

51:32.132 --> 51:33.960
to Brooke, or my baby!

51:34.091 --> 51:36.093
Well, what happened
between you two? Huh?

51:36.223 --> 51:37.572
When was the last
time you saw her?

51:37.659 --> 51:39.096
What happened in
Idaho, Trent?

51:39.183 --> 51:42.577
Things were going OK. We just
moved in with my parents.

51:42.708 --> 51:45.145
I know it's
not perfect.

51:45.276 --> 51:47.321
One morning I wake
up and Brooke's gone.

51:47.408 --> 51:48.931
She left a note there
saying she went to L.A.

51:49.018 --> 51:50.585
to give our baby
up for adoption!

51:50.672 --> 51:51.673
Los Angeles?
-Yeah!

51:51.760 --> 51:53.022
And like an idiot,
I went down there

51:53.153 --> 51:55.590
to look for a friend of
hers to bring her back.

51:55.677 --> 51:57.592
But she lied to me to
throw me off track,

51:57.679 --> 52:00.160
'cause obviously she was here.

52:00.247 --> 52:02.031
Where are you goin'?

52:02.162 --> 52:03.424
To talk to somebody
at that group home!

52:03.555 --> 52:04.425
They don't know anything!

52:06.427 --> 52:07.428
Trent!

52:17.177 --> 52:18.657
Were you able to get
some sleep last night?

52:18.787 --> 52:21.050
No.

52:21.138 --> 52:22.443
Did the doctor
come in already?

52:22.530 --> 52:23.575
Yeah.

52:26.012 --> 52:28.493
Hello, Nicolette. I'm
glad you called me.

52:28.580 --> 52:31.235
So you're saying someone was
following you last night.

52:31.322 --> 52:36.283
I...I don't know. But it,
it felt like it though.

52:38.981 --> 52:41.419
Would you mind
giving us a minute?

52:41.506 --> 52:43.725
Wouldn't it help if I
stayed here for this?

52:43.856 --> 52:45.466
No. I'll be fine.

52:47.468 --> 52:49.470
I'll be right outside
if you need me.

52:54.519 --> 52:56.347
OK, Nicolette. Let's
start at the beginning.

52:58.653 --> 52:59.698
OK.

53:23.722 --> 53:25.941
Abigail! Where have you been?
I can't take this anymore.

53:26.028 --> 53:27.421
Rein it in, Rachel.

53:27.508 --> 53:29.641
There's a cop in
there with her!

53:29.771 --> 53:33.384
I pay you handsomely to keep
your cool. Remember that.

53:36.300 --> 53:38.954
Was she able to give you any
information that might help?

53:39.085 --> 53:42.001
She gave me a good
number of details.

53:42.131 --> 53:44.177
It's important to remember
that Nicolette's traumatized

53:44.264 --> 53:47.180
by seeing what happened
to her friend so...

53:47.311 --> 53:50.357
she may have let her imagination
get the best of her.

53:50.488 --> 53:54.143
However, she was a witness
to a possible homicide,

53:54.274 --> 53:56.450
so we need to take
everything seriously.

53:56.537 --> 53:57.582
Well, of course.

53:59.540 --> 54:01.368
And you are?

54:01.499 --> 54:05.285
I'm Abigail. I'm a friend.

54:05.416 --> 54:07.418
Well, please tell
Nicolette to contact me

54:07.548 --> 54:09.158
if she remembers anything new.

54:09.246 --> 54:10.725
Will do. Thank
you, detective.

54:13.685 --> 54:15.469
What now?

54:15.556 --> 54:18.037
I'm going to speak with
her. Let me handle it.

54:18.167 --> 54:19.604
Abigail: Have you given

54:19.691 --> 54:20.605
any more thought
to adoption?

54:23.347 --> 54:27.394
Yeah. Um, my teacher helped
me understand that it's

54:27.481 --> 54:32.443
important to take my time
with such a big decision.

54:38.623 --> 54:41.278
That's, um, all that
I have left of Brooke.

54:43.236 --> 54:48.981
Tell you what. How 'bout
I order you a ride share?

54:49.068 --> 54:51.331
The car can come and
pick you up right here,

54:51.418 --> 54:52.898
stop by the drugstore.
Pick up anything you need

54:52.985 --> 54:54.639
before you go home.

54:56.510 --> 54:59.861
Yeah, I guess that's OK. Um,
I think that the doctor said

54:59.992 --> 55:02.821
they'll release me a
little after seven.

55:02.908 --> 55:05.171
Great! I will order
you a car for then.

55:09.044 --> 55:12.047
Oh, um...

55:12.134 --> 55:15.007
It's, um, it's
a friend.

55:15.094 --> 55:16.661
Oh. I'll let
you take that.

55:17.966 --> 55:18.663
Thanks.

55:26.497 --> 55:30.501
This is a surprise.

55:30.588 --> 55:34.592
Yeah. I just wanted to check
in, see how you're doing.

55:34.722 --> 55:39.640
Yeah. It was an accident.
I fell. It's a long story.

55:39.727 --> 55:42.121
And... the baby?

55:42.208 --> 55:46.908
It's fine. Yeah. They just,
have me here a little longer

55:46.995 --> 55:53.698
for observation.
Um, I was thinking.

55:53.785 --> 55:57.528
The woman from the adoption
agency Loving Arms

55:57.615 --> 55:59.530
just came by to check on me.

55:59.617 --> 56:04.143
And I'm still leaning towards
the decision of adoption

56:04.230 --> 56:06.537
as the best option for the baby.

56:06.624 --> 56:13.544
Hey, listen. I never told
you this but my dad's

56:13.674 --> 56:17.983
not my birth dad. My mom had
a rough, short first marriage

56:18.070 --> 56:24.293
and well, I was a result
of it. My dad adopted me

56:24.424 --> 56:27.819
when I was two and
married my mom but

56:27.906 --> 56:30.648
Yeah, don't get me
wrong. He's great but...

56:30.778 --> 56:31.736
But, what Jake?

56:34.260 --> 56:38.395
Sometimes I just wonder.
Like why wasn't I enough

56:38.525 --> 56:40.397
for my birth dad
to stick around?

56:44.966 --> 56:47.142
Nicolette seems to have the
address of our birthing rooms

56:47.229 --> 56:50.015
written on a piece of paper.

56:50.102 --> 56:51.364
Abigail: I think Claudia
gave it to Brooke

56:51.451 --> 56:53.235
when she came back to town.

56:53.322 --> 56:54.715
What do you think
we should do?

56:54.802 --> 56:56.891
I need you to come up
with a story for why

56:56.978 --> 56:58.719
Nicolette won't be returning
to the group home tonight.

57:01.026 --> 57:02.114
Are you listening to me?

57:02.244 --> 57:03.507
Yes.

57:03.637 --> 57:06.074
Good! Talk soon.

57:13.560 --> 57:16.171
Alex, it's time to
now move locations.

57:16.258 --> 57:18.130
Be sure to get our
passports ready.

57:18.217 --> 57:19.958
-Sure, I'll talk to Rachel

57:20.045 --> 57:21.525
Don't tell
Rachel anything.

57:25.833 --> 57:27.313
You the lady who
run this place?

57:27.400 --> 57:29.184
Yes, I am.

57:29.315 --> 57:31.186
So where's Brooke at?

57:35.277 --> 57:37.236
Hey, sweetie! How
are things going?

57:37.323 --> 57:39.543
Good. How are you doin' today?

57:39.630 --> 57:42.763
Well, it's been quite the week.

57:42.850 --> 57:44.156
How's your student?

57:44.286 --> 57:46.288
Well, she's still
in the hospital,

57:46.375 --> 57:49.466
but I think she's going to be
released today, thankfully.

57:49.553 --> 57:52.860
OK. Well, I have some good
news that will cheer you up.

57:52.947 --> 57:54.688
Really?

57:54.775 --> 57:57.430
So I just found out I'm
getting this huge bonus,

57:57.517 --> 57:59.214
thanks to that hotel
deal I just closed.

57:59.345 --> 58:00.738
That's awesome!

58:00.825 --> 58:02.217
We can use the money
to pay off--

58:02.348 --> 58:04.524
Actually, what do
you think about us

58:04.611 --> 58:07.962
using that money to
pay for IVF treatments?

58:10.878 --> 58:13.707
Really? You, you wanna try it?

58:13.838 --> 58:15.404
Why not? It's
always been the money

58:15.492 --> 58:17.929
that held us back.

58:18.016 --> 58:22.281
That's great. Uh, let's do it!

58:22.368 --> 58:23.978
I'll make an appointment
for when you get back.

58:24.065 --> 58:26.198
OK. Bye, babe.

58:26.328 --> 58:27.678
OK. Bye.

58:35.599 --> 58:37.731
Once Brooke left the home, we
never heard from her again.

58:37.818 --> 58:39.516
Yeah, but what about
that lady she said

58:39.603 --> 58:41.866
was trying to talk her
into the adoption?

58:41.996 --> 58:45.478
Uh, Abby, or Abigail,
something like that.

58:45.609 --> 58:48.742
She said someone from here
connected her to that agency.

58:48.873 --> 58:51.266
Maybe that woman knows
something about my baby!

58:51.397 --> 58:53.268
I have an idea.

58:53.355 --> 58:55.706
Why don't you give me
your contact information?

58:55.793 --> 58:58.491
I'll do some digging on my
end and I'll get back to you

58:58.578 --> 59:00.101
by the end of the night.

59:01.146 --> 59:02.451
I promise.

59:02.539 --> 59:04.584
All right.

59:04.671 --> 59:06.064
You didn't have to
come back, you know.

59:08.457 --> 59:09.415
I was so worried
about you.

59:12.636 --> 59:14.115
Those are
beautiful.

59:14.202 --> 59:16.161
Oh, yeah. It was a
gift from Abigail

59:16.291 --> 59:18.337
from the adoption agency.

59:18.424 --> 59:19.730
Really? She was here?

59:19.860 --> 59:20.731
Yeah.

59:22.297 --> 59:23.211
That's interesting.

59:25.474 --> 59:28.303
Thank you for everything that
you did for me last night.

59:28.390 --> 59:30.218
I told you. You
can count on me.

59:35.093 --> 59:36.921
You know, talking to
you about your situation

59:39.097 --> 59:41.490
has me thinking a lot
about what I went through.

59:41.578 --> 59:42.579
How so?

59:45.930 --> 59:49.498
Remember when I said that my
parents didn't talk about

59:49.629 --> 59:52.284
my baby when I came
home after having her?

59:55.330 --> 01:00:00.205
I think on some level I knew
how much that affected me,

01:00:00.335 --> 01:00:04.557
how much it had made me blame
myself for the entire thing.

01:00:04.644 --> 01:00:09.562
I thought maybe me not
being able to conceive now

01:00:09.693 --> 01:00:11.346
is because of the shame

01:00:11.477 --> 01:00:13.914
I brought on my
upstanding parents.

01:00:14.001 --> 01:00:17.439
No! You would make
an amazing mom.

01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:20.399
You did the best
that you could,

01:00:20.486 --> 01:00:21.966
just like I'm trying
to do right now.

01:00:24.098 --> 01:00:26.013
Are you sure you're
only sixteen?

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:28.015
'Cause that was
pretty darn wise.

01:00:28.102 --> 01:00:30.844
I have my
moments, I guess.

01:00:34.892 --> 01:00:37.895
I can stick around and give
you a ride home if you want.

01:00:37.982 --> 01:00:40.288
No, it's OK. You've
done enough.

01:00:40.419 --> 01:00:42.856
I actually, I have
a ride share,

01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:45.511
OK. Well, If anything
changes, you can call me. OK?

01:00:46.991 --> 01:00:47.818
Will do.

01:01:00.352 --> 01:01:01.353
Trent: Hello?

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.139
Trent, it's Rachel
at the group home.

01:01:05.226 --> 01:01:07.446
I might have some
information about Brooke

01:01:07.533 --> 01:01:09.796
but we need to keep it
between the two of us

01:01:09.883 --> 01:01:11.972
for the moment.
- Yeah, OK.

01:01:12.059 --> 01:01:14.496
It's very important.
Can you do that?

01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:16.324
Sure. Of course!

01:01:16.411 --> 01:01:21.068
Good. Meet me at 515
Morrison downtown.

01:01:21.155 --> 01:01:24.463
We have to do this in
secret, for Brooke.

01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:25.812
-I'll be there.

01:01:39.478 --> 01:01:40.914
You Trent?

01:01:41.001 --> 01:01:43.700
Yeah? And you are?

01:01:52.578 --> 01:01:54.928
Ah! I can't concentrate
with everything going on!

01:01:55.059 --> 01:01:56.451
Nicolette was supposed
to be back by now!

01:01:56.582 --> 01:01:57.583
Rachel said she was
coming home tonight!

01:02:02.283 --> 01:02:04.938
I've been here three
years, you know?

01:02:05.025 --> 01:02:06.200
Brooke's not the first
girl to disappear

01:02:06.331 --> 01:02:08.507
from here mysteriously.

01:02:08.594 --> 01:02:09.247
What do you mean?

01:02:10.901 --> 01:02:11.728
Never mind.

01:02:23.827 --> 01:02:27.047
Callie, If you know
something, anything, tell me.

01:02:29.571 --> 01:02:30.398
Please.

01:02:37.623 --> 01:02:39.668
There's been at least one
other girl that they said

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:43.063
ran away who was also pregnant.

01:02:43.194 --> 01:02:45.631
What was her name?

01:02:45.718 --> 01:02:50.244
Misty. Misty Miller. She
lived here two years ago,

01:02:50.331 --> 01:02:53.117
and then one day I
walked in on her.

01:02:53.204 --> 01:02:55.119
She had an envelope
with a lot of cash.

01:02:55.249 --> 01:02:57.686
A lot.

01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:01.908
And not soon after,
she was just gone.

01:03:02.039 --> 01:03:04.128
I never found out what
happened to her or her baby

01:03:06.478 --> 01:03:08.915
but I think Rachel knows
something about it.

01:03:09.002 --> 01:03:09.916
Rachel: Callie!

01:03:14.355 --> 01:03:16.009
Callie, do you think
you could help

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.446
Mrs. Hill in the
kitchen for dinner?

01:03:18.533 --> 01:03:20.100
Now, please.

01:03:24.713 --> 01:03:25.671
Everything OK,
Vanesha?

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:26.759
Yeah.

01:04:04.971 --> 01:04:06.190
Nicolette?

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.800
Yeah!

01:04:07.887 --> 01:04:09.149
I'm your ride. Hop in!

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:46.404
Why are we stopping?

01:04:51.931 --> 01:04:56.414
Uh, sorry. One of the
tires is acting funny.

01:04:58.851 --> 01:04:59.896
I'm gonna go check it out.

01:05:10.819 --> 01:05:16.869
What are you doing?

01:06:04.395 --> 01:06:08.573
I'm so sorry about this
situation, Nicolette.

01:06:08.703 --> 01:06:10.967
But unfortunately, you left
me with no alternative.

01:06:13.708 --> 01:06:20.628
Where am I? What is,
what is this place?

01:06:20.715 --> 01:06:24.328
Shhh. It's a temporary home
until I can make arrangements

01:06:24.415 --> 01:06:26.156
for more permanent
accommodations...

01:06:28.854 --> 01:06:30.682
a long way from here.

01:06:49.048 --> 01:06:50.789
Jake! What are you doing here?

01:06:50.876 --> 01:06:52.921
I came to see Nicolette.
-Yeah?

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:54.140
Just wanted to
make sure she's OK..

01:06:54.227 --> 01:06:55.185
Well, she hasn't
come back yet,

01:06:55.272 --> 01:06:56.447
even though she
texted me last night

01:06:56.534 --> 01:06:57.752
and said she
was on her way.

01:06:57.883 --> 01:06:58.623
That's weird.

01:06:58.710 --> 01:07:01.452
Yeah. Where the hell is she?

01:07:01.539 --> 01:07:03.280
This is bad. I feel
it in my bones.

01:07:03.367 --> 01:07:04.194
Where are you going?

01:07:06.239 --> 01:07:07.240
I'm trying to track
down this other girl.

01:07:07.327 --> 01:07:09.242
She used to live here,
and she was pregnant too.

01:07:09.329 --> 01:07:12.158
Just like Brooke, one day
she wasn't here anymore.

01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:14.639
It's a longshot but I think
I know where she works.

01:07:14.726 --> 01:07:17.598
Can I come with you? I
got-I mean, I can drive.

01:07:17.729 --> 01:07:19.818
Sure.
-Great.

01:07:19.905 --> 01:07:21.037
-We can call the hospital too,

01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:22.168
see if they know
anything about Nicolette.

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:36.095
Hey. It's Nicolette.
Leave a message.

01:07:36.182 --> 01:07:38.315
Uh, hi, Nicolette.
It's Ms. Ridling.

01:07:38.402 --> 01:07:40.795
I just wanted to see how
you're feeling today.

01:07:40.926 --> 01:07:42.841
Send me a message
when you get a sec.

01:07:47.324 --> 01:07:52.416
When I get out of this bed, I
swear! Who are you, really?

01:07:52.546 --> 01:07:55.462
Are you in this with Rachel?
Did you have something to do

01:07:55.549 --> 01:08:00.206
with Brooke and
her baby? Tell me!

01:08:00.293 --> 01:08:03.818
Brooke tried to back out
of a agreement we had

01:08:03.905 --> 01:08:06.082
and became a complication.
That's true.

01:08:06.169 --> 01:08:10.695
What did you do with
her baby? Where is it?

01:08:10.825 --> 01:08:14.002
Living happily with a
wonderful, advantaged couple

01:08:14.133 --> 01:08:17.528
who paid a handsome
price. In fact...

01:08:17.615 --> 01:08:21.227
I'm certain I'm going to get
the same for yours.

01:08:27.538 --> 01:08:31.541
Hey. Do you have a second
to chat? I am having a day.

01:08:31.629 --> 01:08:34.979
I think I like overheated,
uh, the milk for a cappuccino

01:08:35.067 --> 01:08:38.636
or something and it
exploded everywhere and...

01:08:38.723 --> 01:08:41.203
I'm gonna call you back
in about five minutes.

01:08:41.291 --> 01:08:42.683
Can I help you guys?

01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:43.467
Are you Misty Miller?

01:08:45.337 --> 01:08:46.644
Why? Who are you two?

01:08:46.773 --> 01:08:48.124
I live at A Path
Ahead Group Home.

01:08:48.254 --> 01:08:49.559
I heard you used
to live there too.

01:08:49.647 --> 01:08:52.476
You were pregnant but then
you left and never came back.

01:08:52.606 --> 01:08:53.693
I don't know what
you're talking...

01:08:53.781 --> 01:08:55.696
Please! One of our friends,
Brooke, disappeared

01:08:55.782 --> 01:08:58.046
and now she's dead.

01:08:58.176 --> 01:08:59.917
And one of our other
friends is pregnant

01:09:00.005 --> 01:09:01.224
and she just went missing too.

01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:03.139
We're just worried for her.

01:09:03.226 --> 01:09:05.010
Look, I'm sorry. I
got nothing to say.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.880
Please! OK. Anything
you say will help.

01:09:06.968 --> 01:09:10.407
We already lost one friend.
We can't lose another.

01:09:10.537 --> 01:09:11.973
-Anything at all.

01:09:16.586 --> 01:09:17.675
Don't trust Rachel.

01:09:19.894 --> 01:09:20.982
I needed cash
at the time,

01:09:21.068 --> 01:09:26.379
so I went with it. Be
careful of Abigail.

01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:28.337
You know, Nicolette
did mention something

01:09:28.468 --> 01:09:33.299
about a lady from an adoption
center who came by. Is that...

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:36.824
Yeah. Abigail runs the agency
that Rachel referred me to.

01:09:36.911 --> 01:09:39.392
Like I said, I
got my cash,

01:09:39.478 --> 01:09:41.742
and I just went on
with my business.

01:09:41.872 --> 01:09:44.615
But I've heard that
some of the other girls,

01:09:44.702 --> 01:09:47.705
they don't have a good
experience with her.

01:09:47.791 --> 01:09:51.752
Please. That is all I can
say. I am begging you.

01:09:51.839 --> 01:09:53.493
Do not come back here and
talk to me about this.

01:10:02.371 --> 01:10:05.112
Hi! I'm looking for Nicolette.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.071
Oh, she's not here.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.424
Oh, uh, I was just
worried about Nicolette.

01:10:11.555 --> 01:10:13.425
When I saw her at the
hospital again yesterday

01:10:13.513 --> 01:10:16.473
You saw her again
at the hospital?

01:10:16.603 --> 01:10:20.477
Yes, and she said she was
coming back here last night,

01:10:20.564 --> 01:10:21.869
and she had a
ride scheduled.

01:10:21.956 --> 01:10:22.740
Well, she didn't
come back here.

01:10:25.699 --> 01:10:28.441
I don't understand. How can
you not know where she is?

01:10:28.528 --> 01:10:30.487
She was supposed to call me
to come pick her up.

01:10:30.574 --> 01:10:32.837
Let me call the hospital again
and get more information.

01:10:32.967 --> 01:10:34.882
And what else
can we do?

01:10:34.969 --> 01:10:37.537
Try not to worry. I'm sure
she'll be back any minute.

01:10:37.624 --> 01:10:39.147
Nicolette has a
mind of her own.

01:10:41.498 --> 01:10:44.849
What are you not telling me?
Nicolette told me that you

01:10:44.936 --> 01:10:47.982
set her up with the contact
at the adoption agency.

01:10:48.068 --> 01:10:51.421
Is that normal
protocol for your job?

01:10:51.508 --> 01:10:53.379
And that woman was here
the night I dropped off

01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:55.686
some things for Nicolette.

01:10:55.816 --> 01:10:58.079
Perhaps this contact knows
where Nicolette is right now.

01:11:00.343 --> 01:11:05.043
I have no idea what you could
possibly be referring to,

01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:07.393
and I'm going to have
to ask you to leave now.

01:11:17.403 --> 01:11:19.536
Vanesha: Ms. Ridling, what
are you doing here?

01:11:19.623 --> 01:11:22.234
I came to check on Nicolette
but she's not here.

01:11:22.365 --> 01:11:23.670
Have you talked to her?

01:11:23.757 --> 01:11:28.545
No, not since she told me she
was coming home and didn't.

01:11:28.632 --> 01:11:32.462
That's worrisome. Uh, what
are you kids doing now?

01:11:32.592 --> 01:11:33.853
We just met somebody
who was pregnant

01:11:33.985 --> 01:11:35.682
and left the group
home a few years back.

01:11:35.813 --> 01:11:37.249
All she would tell us
was not to trust Rachel

01:11:37.335 --> 01:11:39.425
and this woman Abigail,

01:11:39.512 --> 01:11:42.036
who she got referred to
for adoption options.

01:11:42.123 --> 01:11:43.255
And Nicolette told me

01:11:43.342 --> 01:11:45.648
that the name of the
agency was Loving Arms.

01:11:45.736 --> 01:11:48.782
I think I met that woman when
I stopped by the other day.

01:11:48.869 --> 01:11:50.871
And Rachel is
hiding something.

01:11:50.958 --> 01:11:53.787
I'm 100% sure.
She's very on edge.

01:11:55.833 --> 01:11:58.052
Maybe what happened to
your friend Brooke

01:11:58.139 --> 01:11:59.706
and Nicolette are...

01:11:59.837 --> 01:12:01.752
-Are connected.

01:12:01.839 --> 01:12:06.278
Yeah. OK. I'm gonna look up
the address for this agency

01:12:06.409 --> 01:12:08.106
and go there in person.

01:12:08.193 --> 01:12:10.630
I will get this Abigail
woman to talk to me.

01:12:10.717 --> 01:12:12.371
Well, can we do
anything now or?

01:12:12.502 --> 01:12:14.286
Why don't you go talk to
Detective Holmes

01:12:14.373 --> 01:12:16.288
about your suspicions?

01:12:16.375 --> 01:12:17.637
I mean, we don't have
anything concrete yet

01:12:17.724 --> 01:12:20.118
but maybe we can do some
digging into Rachel

01:12:20.248 --> 01:12:22.032
and this Abigail at the agency.

01:12:23.773 --> 01:12:25.602
I'm scared for
Nicolette now.

01:12:25.689 --> 01:12:28.952
Maybe we'll get lucky;
she'll turn up on her own.

01:13:02.116 --> 01:13:04.249
You need to eat
and stay hydrated.

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:05.468
You have a long
journey ahead of you.

01:13:05.598 --> 01:13:07.383
What the hell are you
people gonna do with me?

01:13:07.469 --> 01:13:10.342
Calm down. It's
important for the baby.

01:13:10.473 --> 01:13:11.909
It's hard to stay calm when
you're strapped to a bed

01:13:11.996 --> 01:13:13.780
against your will!

01:13:13.911 --> 01:13:16.653
Don't worry. We'll
take care of you.

01:13:19.743 --> 01:13:21.005
And what are you
gonna do with me

01:13:21.092 --> 01:13:21.745
after the
baby's born?

01:13:26.706 --> 01:13:28.186
Eat.

01:13:50.164 --> 01:13:54.299
Hi. May I help you?

01:13:54.386 --> 01:13:56.823
Hi. Uh, we met at the
home where my student

01:13:56.954 --> 01:13:59.478
Nicolette lives.

01:13:59.565 --> 01:14:02.438
Oh, yes! Nicolette. Uh,
what is this concerning?

01:14:02.568 --> 01:14:03.916
I'm sorry. I'm a
little confused

01:14:04.004 --> 01:14:05.571
as to why
you're here.

01:14:05.657 --> 01:14:08.922
Oh, uh, Nicolette didn't
make it back to the home

01:14:09.009 --> 01:14:11.272
last night from
the hospital.

01:14:11.359 --> 01:14:13.449
Oh! I, I don't know
anything about that.

01:14:16.321 --> 01:14:18.715
Have you helped set up
adoptions for other girls

01:14:18.802 --> 01:14:20.151
at the agency?

01:14:20.237 --> 01:14:22.370
Oh, well, a,
a couple.

01:14:22.501 --> 01:14:25.416
Sometimes young women
who need guidance.

01:14:25.504 --> 01:14:28.942
I'm sorry, but I'm going to
be late for an appointment.

01:14:30.857 --> 01:14:32.772
Fine. Thank you
for your time.

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:40.084
Dammit.

01:14:50.834 --> 01:14:52.835
Let's just see where
you're headed to next.

01:14:54.925 --> 01:14:56.100
Abigail: Alex,
listen carefully.

01:14:56.187 --> 01:14:58.058
We need to move our
guest to a new location

01:14:58.189 --> 01:15:00.017
before our partners
come for the pickup.

01:15:00.103 --> 01:15:01.800
Too many people are
asking questions.

01:15:10.984 --> 01:15:12.682
Why in God's name are
you in this part of town?

01:15:17.034 --> 01:15:18.383
Uh, hi, Mark.

01:15:18.469 --> 01:15:21.168
Hey, babe. How are
things going?

01:15:21.299 --> 01:15:22.735
Can I call you back later?

01:15:22.866 --> 01:15:25.608
Everything OK? You
sound stressed.

01:15:25.737 --> 01:15:29.481
No, everything's OK.
It's just been a day.

01:15:29.612 --> 01:15:30.960
I'll call you back later.

01:15:31.048 --> 01:15:32.179
OK.

01:15:35.618 --> 01:15:37.402
Detective Holmes:
Now, you're saying Nicolette

01:15:37.489 --> 01:15:39.273
never came back to the
home from the hospital.

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.187
-Right.

01:15:40.318 --> 01:15:41.624
I even called
the hospital,

01:15:41.710 --> 01:15:43.539
and the nurse told me that
she was released last night.

01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:47.325
Look, there have been
suspicions regarding

01:15:47.455 --> 01:15:50.502
both your group home manager
and the adoption agency.

01:15:50.633 --> 01:15:52.722
Brooke, Misty,
and now Nicolette

01:15:52.852 --> 01:15:55.638
are all tied to
this Abigail person.

01:15:55.725 --> 01:15:57.378
I'm gonna talk to Rachel
Medford as soon as possible.

01:15:59.424 --> 01:16:01.513
Believe me, I wanna find out
what happened to your friend

01:16:01.644 --> 01:16:02.906
as badly as you do.

01:16:04.559 --> 01:16:05.865
Please.

01:16:25.755 --> 01:16:26.407
Wha...?

01:17:01.878 --> 01:17:03.531
Sandy: What is this place!

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:06.230
What the hell? Are
you following me?

01:17:06.317 --> 01:17:07.492
Tell me where Nicolette is!

01:17:30.471 --> 01:17:31.472
Holmes here.

01:17:31.559 --> 01:17:32.603
Hi. This is Sandy Ridling.

01:17:32.735 --> 01:17:34.693
We met yesterday
at the hospital.

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:37.043
-Nicolette's teacher.
-Yes. um...

01:17:37.174 --> 01:17:42.048
something big is
happening. I'm not sure.

01:17:42.135 --> 01:17:43.441
-Mrs. Ridling, take
a deep breath

01:17:43.528 --> 01:17:44.964
and tell me what's happening.

01:17:45.094 --> 01:17:48.925
-OK. I followed the woman that
the girls were sent to as an

01:17:49.012 --> 01:17:51.928
adoption contact to some
rundown location downtown.

01:17:52.014 --> 01:17:53.407
-Wait? What?

01:17:53.494 --> 01:17:57.455
-This woman, Abigail, attacked
me when I confronted her,

01:17:57.585 --> 01:17:59.370
but I pepper-sprayed her.

01:17:59.457 --> 01:18:01.371
I think this is where
Nicolette is being held

01:18:01.459 --> 01:18:02.416
or something.

01:18:02.547 --> 01:18:04.157
-Tell me where you're
at exactly.

01:18:04.288 --> 01:18:08.422
-I'm at 141 State Street.

01:18:08.509 --> 01:18:10.207
I'm gonna go inside the
building to see if I can--

01:18:10.294 --> 01:18:11.730
-Do not go inside anywhere!

01:18:11.817 --> 01:18:13.732
You hear me? I'm
sending help right now!

01:18:13.818 --> 01:18:14.864
-Please hurry!

01:18:17.867 --> 01:18:19.520
Get cars to 141 State Street.

01:18:19.607 --> 01:18:21.609
Possible one-thirty-four
in progress.

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:23.219
We got a huge break
in the Summers case.

01:18:54.555 --> 01:18:56.340
Abigail! Are you OK?

01:18:56.427 --> 01:18:59.082
Never mind me! Just go in
there and stop that woman

01:18:59.212 --> 01:19:01.214
from getting
Nicolette out!

01:19:10.049 --> 01:19:12.050
Sandy: Nicolette?
Are you here?

01:19:12.182 --> 01:19:13.270
Yeah! I'm in here!

01:19:21.278 --> 01:19:22.105
Help me!

01:19:28.415 --> 01:19:30.722
Oh my.. Oh, my God!

01:19:30.809 --> 01:19:32.463
How did you find me?

01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:33.333
Talk about
that later.

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:35.727
OK. We, we have to
get out of here.

01:19:35.814 --> 01:19:38.338
There are people that are
gonna come and take me

01:19:38.469 --> 01:19:40.776
to a different country,
like God knows where!

01:19:43.255 --> 01:19:45.693
OK. OK. Police are on their
way. Uh, are you hurt?

01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:47.957
I think I'm OK. I
just I'm really

01:19:48.044 --> 01:19:48.784
I'm scared out of my mind.

01:19:51.351 --> 01:19:54.050
We're gonna get you
out of here, OK? OK?

01:19:55.094 --> 01:19:56.487
Alex: Step away
from the girl!

01:20:01.187 --> 01:20:02.449
What is this for?

01:20:04.016 --> 01:20:04.495
Tape up her hands.

01:20:07.411 --> 01:20:08.325
I'm not gonna
do that.

01:20:25.777 --> 01:20:27.518
I'm not just gonna stay
here like a sitting duck.

01:21:02.118 --> 01:21:03.641
What's taking you so long?

01:21:03.728 --> 01:21:05.121
I'm, I'm, I'm trying!
I'm just really nervous.

01:21:11.344 --> 01:21:12.737
Hurry up!

01:21:12.824 --> 01:21:13.737
Abigail: Alex!

01:21:19.135 --> 01:21:20.440
Come on! Come
on! Let's go!

01:21:38.675 --> 01:21:40.199
This is over!

01:22:11.230 --> 01:22:11.883
Hey.

01:22:12.014 --> 01:22:14.190
It's legal
and official!

01:22:14.277 --> 01:22:16.627
We're a big family now. The
judge signed off on it.

01:22:16.757 --> 01:22:20.109
Congrats. I'm really
happy for you guys.

01:22:20.196 --> 01:22:21.588
I still can't believe
that I get to call

01:22:21.719 --> 01:22:23.242
Mark and Sandy my parents.

01:22:23.373 --> 01:22:24.243
We're the
lucky ones.

01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:24.940
I'll second
that.

01:22:27.072 --> 01:22:28.900
I really appreciate you
looking after Michael

01:22:28.987 --> 01:22:30.249
while we were at
the courthouse.

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:32.382
It's no problem at all.

01:22:32.469 --> 01:22:35.080
I mean, I said I wanted to
be a part of his life, right?

01:22:35.210 --> 01:22:38.040
And, well, it took me a while
to get acquainted to it,

01:22:38.127 --> 01:22:39.476
but now I'm all in,

01:22:41.695 --> 01:22:44.871
Did you tell Jake
the other big news?

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.612
Wait! Have you been
holding out on me?

01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:51.314
I've been accepted
to the college of my choice,

01:22:51.401 --> 01:22:53.446
so I'll be heading
there in the fall,

01:22:53.532 --> 01:22:55.361
but I get to stay
here at home.

01:22:55.492 --> 01:22:57.189
That's amazing.

01:22:57.276 --> 01:22:59.148
So we can just be with
our new forever family.

01:23:01.324 --> 01:23:03.934
And to think, this time
last year, we were worried

01:23:04.066 --> 01:23:06.807
that we wouldn't have a
family of our own. And now

01:23:06.938 --> 01:23:09.114
We're blessed,
many times over.

01:23:11.725 --> 01:23:13.727
Mommy's sweet little boy.

01:23:14.728 --> 01:23:17.209
Oh!

01:23:17.296 --> 01:23:19.995
Oh, it's Vanesha!
I'll be right back.

01:23:24.912 --> 01:23:26.610
Hey! I was just gonna call you.

01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:28.264
How'd it go today?

01:23:30.222 --> 01:23:32.746
He's so strong!

01:23:32.877 --> 01:23:36.315
It's official.
And you?

01:23:36.446 --> 01:23:39.884
My aunt's been approved to be
my legal guardian!

01:23:40.014 --> 01:23:41.494
Looks like we're
both finally home.

01:23:41.581 --> 01:23:43.496
-I'm so happy for you.

01:23:43.627 --> 01:23:45.020
I'll call you later.

01:23:55.291 --> 01:23:58.163
I know! It's really
coming together.

01:23:58.250 --> 01:24:00.948
Ohh! Look who's here.

01:24:12.656 --> 01:24:15.224
