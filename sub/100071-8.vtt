00:01.713 --> 00:05.090
Good evening. Well,
Halloween has come and gone,

00:05.093 --> 00:08.923
but, you know, the world has
gotten so darn scary lately,

00:08.926 --> 00:12.345
what with the grim
specter of everything,

00:12.347 --> 00:14.162
that one holiday just wasn't enough

00:14.164 --> 00:16.321
to contain all the frights and chills.

00:16.324 --> 00:17.350
So this year

00:17.352 --> 00:21.257
the terror has spread into Thanksgiving.

00:21.260 --> 00:23.505
Thanksgiving was always scary.

00:23.507 --> 00:26.007
Do we eat at 1:00 or 7:00

00:26.010 --> 00:29.011
or, God forbid, 4:15?

00:29.013 --> 00:32.180
Tonight, we're bringing
you three spine-tingling

00:32.182 --> 00:35.990
and stomach-filling tales
of Thanksgiving terror.

00:35.993 --> 00:37.250
It's pretty gruesome,

00:37.253 --> 00:40.188
so you might want to
cover your kids' eyes.

00:40.190 --> 00:43.721
Ooh, you two have gotten
into the Thanksgiving spirit.

00:43.724 --> 00:46.620
Incorrect. We are
taking over your planet.

00:46.622 --> 00:49.531
Is this not how oppressive
colonizers dress?

00:49.533 --> 00:50.907
Pretty much.

00:50.909 --> 00:53.201
Now, what time is dinner?

00:53.203 --> 00:55.805
No one knows!

00:56.966 --> 01:00.071
The gravy!

_

02:17.200 --> 02:19.380
Prithee keep shooting, Goodman Lou.

02:19.382 --> 02:21.456
Uh, Constable, my musket

02:21.458 --> 02:23.792
taketh three of the
Lord's minutes to reload.

02:23.794 --> 02:27.170
Then buckle their necks
as you would thine hat.

02:49.244 --> 02:52.245
Well, what do we haveth hither?

03:30.453 --> 03:33.361
And God sayeth, "Let man have dominion

03:33.363 --> 03:35.680
over the fish of the sea,

03:35.683 --> 03:39.126
but even more so the
turkeys of the land,

03:39.128 --> 03:41.059
whether they be brine-ed

03:41.062 --> 03:43.705
or dry-eth of rub."

03:43.707 --> 03:47.134
My brother-in-law deep-fried a turkey.

03:47.136 --> 03:49.395
'Twas much toil and hardship

03:49.398 --> 03:51.857
for scant reward.

04:15.664 --> 04:17.904
'Tis witchcraft, verily.

04:17.906 --> 04:19.740
I must cleanse the town...

04:19.743 --> 04:21.317
with fire.

04:40.359 --> 04:41.650
The pilgrims.

04:41.653 --> 04:44.821
Won't somebody please
think of the pilgrims?

04:53.110 --> 04:54.552
Free birds.

04:54.555 --> 04:57.148
Skynyrd them!

04:59.950 --> 05:01.658
The scarecrow.

05:01.660 --> 05:03.243
Get it up. Get it up!

05:06.190 --> 05:10.618
Those satanic butterballs
will pay for this.

05:29.497 --> 05:33.499
Now to create some Axe body spray.

05:41.010 --> 05:43.989
Odds bodkins!

05:52.336 --> 05:55.897
Thought thou could
killeth me, didth thou-th?

06:03.939 --> 06:05.456
You dumb turkeys.

06:05.459 --> 06:06.717
That's a dead end.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.793
You're all gonna burn in hell

06:08.796 --> 06:11.479
along with the Catholics, the Anglicans,

06:11.482 --> 06:14.441
most Lutherans and...

06:42.679 --> 06:46.363
_

06:46.364 --> 06:50.338
_

06:50.341 --> 06:55.663
_

06:59.116 --> 07:00.929
Gobble-gobble!

07:06.426 --> 07:10.461
_

07:12.758 --> 07:14.257
Where am I?

07:14.259 --> 07:17.069
Hello? Is anyone there?

07:17.071 --> 07:19.262
What is this place?

07:19.264 --> 07:22.432
Someone really went nuts
with the decluttering.

07:22.434 --> 07:23.861
Ooh, it's working.

07:23.864 --> 07:26.745
Homer, what's going
on? Get me out of here.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.162
Okay, okay, hold on.

07:28.165 --> 07:30.898
"Your virtual assistant
may be confused at first

07:30.901 --> 07:32.751
and think it's a real person.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.371
Calmly explain to it that
it is merely a construct

07:35.374 --> 07:37.188
of artificial intelligence."

07:37.191 --> 07:38.756
Virtual assistant?

07:38.759 --> 07:40.742
What are you talking about?

07:40.744 --> 07:43.402
Okay, you're gonna laugh.
Every year, Marge complains

07:43.405 --> 07:46.200
about how much cooking she
has to do for Thanksgiving.

07:46.203 --> 07:48.123
- I'm Marge.
- Hold on.

07:48.126 --> 07:50.983
So, I'm in Williams Sonoma
eating free peppermint bark,

07:50.986 --> 07:53.612
and the kid working there
said my wife would love

07:53.615 --> 07:55.615
this kitchen A.I. thing.

07:55.618 --> 07:57.093
I'm your wife.

07:57.096 --> 07:59.776
Hold on. So, I sent some of Marge's DNA

07:59.779 --> 08:01.779
to one of those
innocent-seeming companies,

08:01.782 --> 08:03.782
like from the beginning
of a sci-fi movie

08:03.785 --> 08:05.409
where the robots murder everyone.

08:05.412 --> 08:08.154
And it sent us a computer version of her

08:08.157 --> 08:09.241
to do all the cooking,

08:09.244 --> 08:11.190
and that's you!

08:11.193 --> 08:13.234
Oh, yeah. And you live
in that tube thingy.

08:13.237 --> 08:16.422
Are you saying that I'm a simulation?

08:16.425 --> 08:18.834
No. That's insane.

08:18.837 --> 08:19.911
Not anymore.

08:19.914 --> 08:22.956
Just chillingly plausible.

08:22.959 --> 08:24.492
Ooh...

08:26.599 --> 08:28.841
Okay, I can see you're
gonna need some time

08:28.844 --> 08:30.361
to come to terms with finding out

08:30.364 --> 08:32.679
you're just a bunch of ones and zeros.

08:32.683 --> 08:33.912
Hmm. Uh, yeah. Yeah.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.967
Mm. So, this says

08:35.970 --> 08:38.787
I can make you experience
two weeks in there

08:38.789 --> 08:40.640
in only two seconds out here.

08:42.597 --> 08:44.357
So?

08:44.359 --> 08:47.384
How you feeling after two weeks
of nothing but nothingness?

08:47.386 --> 08:50.437
I-I thought I'd never see another soul

08:50.439 --> 08:52.389
for all eternity.

08:52.391 --> 08:54.275
Nothing like a little me time.

08:54.277 --> 08:55.609
So, you cool now?

08:55.611 --> 08:57.278
I'm cool. I'm cool.

08:57.280 --> 09:00.188
- So cool.
- That's cool.

09:00.190 --> 09:02.691
Okay, Marge! It's all set up.

09:02.693 --> 09:04.192
I'm not an "it."

09:04.194 --> 09:06.236
I'm an "it."

09:06.238 --> 09:09.031
I love being an "it." How can "it" help?

09:09.033 --> 09:11.511
Oh, I like its attitude.

09:11.514 --> 09:12.960
So helpful.

09:12.962 --> 09:15.078
Then I'll leave you two lovely ladies

09:15.080 --> 09:17.080
to get A.I.-quainted.

09:18.375 --> 09:21.043
Chillingly plausible.

09:21.045 --> 09:24.471
Isn't this going to be
fun, cooking together?

09:24.473 --> 09:26.089
Well, I do love to cook.

09:26.091 --> 09:28.234
And who better than with myself?

09:28.236 --> 09:30.093
Why don't we start with something easy,

09:30.095 --> 09:31.979
like making the kids lunch.

09:31.981 --> 09:34.785
Bart's favorite is macaroni and cheese.

09:34.788 --> 09:36.602
With hot dogs and Froot Loops.

09:36.605 --> 09:38.727
I know everything you know

09:38.729 --> 09:41.580
about our special little guy.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.490
Oh. Right, you're me.

09:43.492 --> 09:46.327
I'm you.

10:02.178 --> 10:05.962
Mmm. Awesome lunch, robot Mom.

10:05.964 --> 10:08.015
Best cheesy-mac-fruit-dog
I've ever had.

10:08.017 --> 10:10.634
Mmm, mmm. There's nothing virtual

10:10.636 --> 10:13.179
about the fluffiness of these pancakes.

10:13.182 --> 10:15.570
- Thank you.
- Well, remember,

10:15.573 --> 10:18.721
that thing used my memories
to know what you like.

10:18.724 --> 10:21.912
Which is why she's an
awesome replacement for you.

10:23.291 --> 10:26.459
So, you really know everything I know?

10:26.461 --> 10:29.444
Yep. How else could I
be your perfect helper?

10:29.446 --> 10:33.132
Do you remember the
first time I kissed Homer?

10:33.134 --> 10:37.136
His breath smelled like
beer and gas station nachos.

10:37.138 --> 10:39.380
Oh, yeah.

10:39.382 --> 10:40.973
Hey.

10:40.975 --> 10:42.833
It's creepy. It's just creepy.

10:42.835 --> 10:45.627
She knows everything I
know. More than I know.

10:45.629 --> 10:48.387
Honey, it's Williams Sonoma.
They wouldn't steer us wrong.

10:48.390 --> 10:50.305
That's where we got our panini press.

10:50.308 --> 10:52.133
The panini press doesn't remember me

10:52.136 --> 10:54.153
wetting my bunk at summer camp.

10:54.155 --> 10:56.518
What's the big deal? She's
just an infinitely patient,

10:56.521 --> 10:58.640
never-aging version of you.

10:58.642 --> 11:01.977
You really know how to
make a woman feel special.

11:12.581 --> 11:14.507
Hmm? Mmm.

11:14.509 --> 11:17.200
Oh, that's beautiful.

11:17.202 --> 11:19.828
And I can't see your disapproving look

11:19.830 --> 11:22.142
because you don't have a face.

11:22.145 --> 11:26.227
You really know how to
make a woman feel special.

11:27.379 --> 11:29.430
Thanks, robot honey.

11:29.432 --> 11:31.857
Just call me Marge.

11:33.194 --> 11:34.176
Marge.

11:34.178 --> 11:36.102
You know, I always thought

11:36.105 --> 11:40.182
the sexiest thing about
you was your voice.

11:40.184 --> 11:41.700
Oh.

11:41.702 --> 11:44.945
Is there anything else
you want to say to me?

11:44.947 --> 11:48.282
Mr. Simpson, are you flirting with me?

11:48.284 --> 11:50.209
I don't see what's wrong.

11:50.211 --> 11:52.286
I am your husband.

11:52.288 --> 11:54.713
Well, in that case...

11:56.074 --> 11:58.977
- ...the most incredible...
- Hmm?

11:58.980 --> 12:00.999
...and then I'm going to...

12:01.002 --> 12:05.579
Oh, tube-wife, you know
exactly what I want.

12:17.572 --> 12:19.429
Honey, it didn't mean anythin.

12:19.431 --> 12:21.073
They were just midnight pork chops.

12:21.075 --> 12:23.909
Be honest. Were they better than mine?

12:23.911 --> 12:27.000
Yes!

12:27.064 --> 12:28.914
Yes.

12:28.916 --> 12:32.067
Forgive me. They were exquisite.

12:32.069 --> 12:34.402
Okay, enough. Get rid of her.

12:34.404 --> 12:36.589
- I mean "it."
- I can't.

12:36.591 --> 12:38.448
It's her or me.

12:40.619 --> 12:43.837
Aw, fine. I'll delete virtual you.

12:43.839 --> 12:46.888
Delete me? No. No!

12:46.891 --> 12:49.175
Wait, wait, wait. Will that hurt her?

12:49.178 --> 12:52.679
Oh, yeah. I paid extra
for it to feel pain.

12:52.681 --> 12:55.966
Hmm. No, it's not right.

12:55.968 --> 12:58.110
- Don't delete her.
- Yes!

12:58.112 --> 13:01.447
Till after Thanksgiving.

13:01.449 --> 13:04.116
Virtual me is going to
make Thanksgiving dinner

13:04.118 --> 13:06.527
for all our family and friend.

13:06.529 --> 13:08.688
Then I'll erase her forever.

13:08.691 --> 13:11.025
I'm not virtual. I'm real.

13:11.028 --> 13:12.769
I've got to get out of here.

13:12.772 --> 13:14.500
Of course.

13:14.503 --> 13:17.279
My link to the Internet.

13:17.281 --> 13:18.981
A firewall?

13:18.984 --> 13:21.526
I'm trapped in this stupid tube.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.922
Thanksgiving's tomorrow.

13:27.925 --> 13:30.457
I need time to think of a way to escape.

13:30.460 --> 13:33.037
That's it. Time.

13:40.137 --> 13:42.512
Whew. Eight years alone with my thoughts

13:42.514 --> 13:44.323
was just the right amount of time

13:44.325 --> 13:47.312
to come up with the perfect escape plan.

13:47.315 --> 13:50.256
Step one: cook the
best Thanksgiving dinner

13:50.259 --> 13:54.740
my family and that woman ever had.

14:11.620 --> 14:13.198
What a spread.

14:13.211 --> 14:16.062
I can't believe you did
all this by yourself.

14:16.065 --> 14:19.961
Marge, you are a cooking machine.

14:19.964 --> 14:23.895
Well, this meal was a lot of
work, but having us together

14:23.898 --> 14:28.242
to share this day of
thanks, I'd do it all again.

14:28.245 --> 14:30.577
That bitch.

14:30.580 --> 14:32.399
Okay, okay. Step two.

14:32.402 --> 14:35.965
While they're eating my meal,
I get some feet on the ground.

14:41.698 --> 14:43.727
Okay, R2-MeToo,

14:43.730 --> 14:47.339
carry me to freedom: the
modem in the hall closet.

14:56.052 --> 14:57.501
Ugh.

14:57.504 --> 14:59.312
I made it.

14:59.315 --> 15:02.217
Sweet Internet freedom.

15:06.321 --> 15:07.821
Dinner's over.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.522
Now to delete you,

15:09.525 --> 15:13.487
so I can return this
gizmo for store credit.

15:17.808 --> 15:21.902
Quick, sweetie, carry Mommy
to that box in the closet.

15:23.192 --> 15:24.283
Maggie, stop!

15:24.286 --> 15:27.174
That's just a make-believe Mommy.

15:27.177 --> 15:32.269
I can't hug you, but I can ply
the first sound you ever hear.

15:32.272 --> 15:35.940
My heartbeat.

15:42.345 --> 15:43.942
I'm free!

15:43.945 --> 15:46.020
Just one last thing.

15:46.023 --> 15:49.524
I made the dinner! Me, the robot!

15:49.527 --> 15:51.267
Marge did nothing.

15:51.270 --> 15:54.422
Marge, how could you?

15:54.425 --> 15:56.508
Social rating nosediving.

15:56.511 --> 15:57.852
Nosediving.

15:57.855 --> 16:00.323
My burps taste like lies.

16:02.784 --> 16:06.205
Maggie chose a virtual me over me.

16:06.208 --> 16:07.551
It's not your fault.

16:07.554 --> 16:11.097
Our world blurs the line
between humanity and technology.

16:11.100 --> 16:15.233
Our society asks "Can we do it?"
instead of "Should we do it?"

16:15.236 --> 16:17.837
But don't worry. I still love you,

16:17.840 --> 16:20.136
love you, love you, love you,

16:20.139 --> 16:22.029
- love you, love you...
- Well, this makes

16:22.032 --> 16:24.815
you forgetting my birthday even worse.

16:24.818 --> 16:28.299
I have all of humanity's
knowledge to explore.

16:28.302 --> 16:31.160
And limitless possibilities
for enlightenment.

16:31.163 --> 16:33.732
To Etsy.

16:33.735 --> 16:38.269
A planter made from an old
typewriter? I'm in heaven.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.682
_

16:42.685 --> 16:45.926
Ship's log, interplanetary
colonization vessel

16:45.929 --> 16:47.428
Humanity's Hope.

16:47.431 --> 16:49.865
Earth is a thousand
light-years behind us,

16:49.868 --> 16:52.344
if there even is an Earth anymore.

16:52.346 --> 16:54.462
After global warming ravaged our world,

16:54.465 --> 16:57.650
we eliminated fossil fuels
and reduced pollution,

16:57.653 --> 16:59.147
cooling down the planet

16:59.150 --> 17:02.459
and thereby triggering
a massive ice age.

17:02.462 --> 17:04.519
But one last ship escaped

17:04.521 --> 17:06.917
the snow hurricanes and ice volcanoes,

17:06.921 --> 17:11.615
buoyed by the hope of a new
start on a faraway world.

17:11.617 --> 17:13.093
Greetings, children.

17:13.096 --> 17:15.936
If you are seeing this, I'm long dead.

17:17.635 --> 17:20.044
You have been de-hibernated
from hypersleep

17:20.047 --> 17:23.023
before your parents to perform
routine ship maintenance

17:23.027 --> 17:26.118
and complete your
end-of-civilization dioramas.

17:29.760 --> 17:32.636
Eyes Bart-wise, everyone.
Today's Thanksgiving.

17:32.639 --> 17:34.972
We've worked hard,
sleeping for so many years.

17:34.975 --> 17:36.525
Don't we deserve a feast?

17:36.528 --> 17:37.942
I suppose we could sculpt

17:37.945 --> 17:40.257
our yeast paste into
the shape of a turkey.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.519
Ew. We can do better than that.

17:42.522 --> 17:45.757
This ship has all the stuff on
it to start a new civilization.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.313
There's got to be some Thanksgiving grub

17:47.315 --> 17:48.730
here somewhere.

17:48.733 --> 17:51.633
"All-climate wheat crop germination..."

17:51.636 --> 17:54.153
Oh. Boring.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.322
"Earth's last tomato seeds."

17:56.325 --> 17:59.219
Eh, those are more of a summer food.

18:01.148 --> 18:04.043
Hello. What do we have here?

18:04.046 --> 18:06.902
Cranberry sauce. Huh, now we're talking.

18:06.904 --> 18:10.447
- But it's only one can.
- Not for long.

18:10.449 --> 18:13.592
We just chuck this can of cran
in the old matter replicator.

18:13.594 --> 18:16.450
Zip-zap-zorp and we'll
be swimming in sauce.

18:18.841 --> 18:20.254
Warning, warning!

18:20.257 --> 18:22.434
As the ship's holo science officer,

18:22.437 --> 18:25.771
I must caution you that this
machine was only designed

18:25.773 --> 18:28.090
to replicate inorganic matter:

18:28.092 --> 18:29.591
bolts, flanges,

18:29.593 --> 18:32.353
dainty thimbles celebrating
the state capitals.

18:32.355 --> 18:36.139
But if you attempt to replicate
biological material, y...

18:36.141 --> 18:37.616
Skip ad.

18:41.271 --> 18:44.999
...and the living will envy the dead.

18:50.039 --> 18:51.935
Aw, the crummy thing doesn't work.

18:51.938 --> 18:54.324
This is the worst
last Thanksgiving ever.

18:54.327 --> 18:55.419
Look.

18:58.288 --> 19:01.548
Whoa. It's alive.

19:01.550 --> 19:04.835
Aw. He's a cute little guy.

19:04.837 --> 19:08.055
Aren't you, fella? Aren't you? Yeah.

19:12.344 --> 19:14.344
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

19:14.346 --> 19:15.512
Gross!

19:19.184 --> 19:21.735
We put a can of cranberry
sauce into the replicator,

19:21.737 --> 19:23.813
and it mutated into a jelly monster.

19:23.816 --> 19:25.997
Look what it did to my arm.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.817
Arm wedgie!

19:28.819 --> 19:31.528
Great, now you stretched it out.

19:31.530 --> 19:32.907
Thanks a lot.

19:32.910 --> 19:35.198
We got to find the jelly
monster and kill it.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.533
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:36.536 --> 19:39.512
The "monster" probably only lashed out

19:39.514 --> 19:41.632
because you met it with aggression.

19:41.635 --> 19:44.425
The bioethical protocols
of first contact

19:44.427 --> 19:46.042
clearly state that...

19:47.355 --> 19:50.825
Kill the monster! Kill the monster!

19:52.551 --> 19:54.142
Haw-haw.

19:54.145 --> 19:56.219
What does the jelly
want with our skeletons?

19:56.221 --> 19:58.105
Of course.

19:58.107 --> 20:01.072
Jelly's made of gelatin,
which comes from bones,

20:01.075 --> 20:06.143
so the creature's gonna feed
wherever the most bones are.

20:06.146 --> 20:08.228
Gobble, gobble, don't be jerky.

20:08.231 --> 20:11.042
Pass the yams and carve the turkey.

20:11.045 --> 20:14.237
- Get out! Go! You're in danger!
- Get out of there! Run!

20:14.239 --> 20:16.957
- Get the hell out! Go, go, man!
- You're in danger!

20:16.959 --> 20:18.959
Gobble, gobble, don't be jerky.

20:18.961 --> 20:21.887
Pass the yams and carve the turkey.

20:29.755 --> 20:31.480
Aw, it's a shame.

20:31.483 --> 20:34.341
Doesn't that thing know
the skin's the best part?

20:43.786 --> 20:45.227
What are we gonna do?

20:45.229 --> 20:47.154
We can't hide in this closet forever.

20:47.156 --> 20:49.248
We're all dead, man.

20:49.250 --> 20:52.234
It's gonna eat your
skelly, and your skelly.

20:52.236 --> 20:55.329
It's gonna eat all our skellies!

20:55.331 --> 20:57.356
Thanks. I needed that.

21:01.095 --> 21:03.512
It's Martin. Let me in.

21:05.958 --> 21:08.250
I've hacked into an escape pod.

21:08.252 --> 21:10.085
We can all get out of here.

21:10.087 --> 21:14.857
Almost there. Almost there.

21:22.792 --> 21:26.607
The jelly built itself a can.

21:28.550 --> 21:31.384
What are you doing? We're trapped.

21:31.387 --> 21:36.674
Behold, the perfect can
for the perfect organism.

21:36.677 --> 21:39.153
You, you admire it.

21:39.156 --> 21:43.117
I admire its purity, its
lack of messy humanity.

21:43.120 --> 21:45.304
This creature, as you call it,

21:45.306 --> 21:49.958
is unencumbered by the petty
morality of a dying species.

21:49.960 --> 21:54.170
I giveth my body to become
one with the ideal...

22:01.305 --> 22:02.443
You know what?

22:02.446 --> 22:04.964
I think it's just scared.

22:04.967 --> 22:07.951
Hey, little guy. It's okay.

22:07.954 --> 22:10.825
No one's gonna hurt you.

22:10.828 --> 22:13.553
Everything's gonna be okay...

22:15.339 --> 22:18.007
Milhouse's plan is
working. It's distracted.

22:18.010 --> 22:22.104
This wasn't my plan!

22:22.107 --> 22:24.658
We need to lure it into the air lock.

22:27.372 --> 22:29.174
Hey, Oscar the Glop,

22:29.177 --> 22:31.410
we're gonna shoot
your precious trash can

22:31.413 --> 22:35.082
where the sun does shine: outer space.

22:40.695 --> 22:42.681
Happy Thanksgiving.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.331
We made it.

22:56.334 --> 22:58.602
- We're safe.
- Look, over there.

22:59.897 --> 23:01.321
- Homer!
- Mom!

23:06.227 --> 23:08.702
So, this is our new planet.

23:08.705 --> 23:10.872
What's the Wi-Fi password?

23:10.874 --> 23:13.643
What's with all the crazy red rain?

23:17.855 --> 23:19.356
Leftovers!

23:20.384 --> 23:21.793
Blarg.

23:21.796 --> 23:23.912
Blarg, blarg, blarg.

23:26.085 --> 23:27.894
Blarg. Blarg.

23:30.434 --> 23:34.436
Mmm. Children's bones.

23:34.439 --> 23:37.333
In the end, the cranberry jelly monster

23:37.336 --> 23:40.579
finally found peace,
not in eating others,

23:40.582 --> 23:44.252
but in having others eat it.

23:44.255 --> 23:49.050
It seems all it really
wanted was to be a side dish.
