00:00.083 --> 00:02.333
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.417 --> 00:04.917
<i>Mike's plan to propose to Susan...</i>

00:05.000 --> 00:06.500
These things don't belong to Jane.

00:06.583 --> 00:07.667
Mike Delfino.

00:07.750 --> 00:10.458
<i>...was a surprise to Ian.</i>

00:10.542 --> 00:11.875
<i>Monique was murdered.</i>

00:11.959 --> 00:13.083
There's been an accident.

00:13.166 --> 00:14.291
<i>And Orson...</i>

00:14.375 --> 00:15.583
Don't forget your wrench.

00:15.667 --> 00:17.417
<i>...passed the blame.</i>

00:17.500 --> 00:19.542
<i>A connection was made.</i>

00:21.959 --> 00:24.000
<i>A heart was broken.</i>

00:24.083 --> 00:27.333
<i>And Bree buried her husband Rex.</i>

00:35.250 --> 00:38.333
<i>My name is Rex Van De Kamp.</i>

00:38.417 --> 00:41.291
<i>I always hated cemeteries</i>
<i>when I was alive.</i>

00:41.375 --> 00:44.041
<i>Now that I'm dead,</i>
<i>I like them even less.</i>

00:47.000 --> 00:50.959
<i>Here's where I used to live.</i>
<i>A whole lot nicer, don't you think?</i>

00:52.083 --> 00:54.458
<i>The place hasn't changed much</i>
<i>since I left.</i>

00:54.542 --> 00:56.917
<i>As tasteful and tidy as ever.</i>

00:57.000 --> 01:00.625
<i>Everything perfect.</i>
<i>At least, on the surface.</i>

01:00.709 --> 01:03.709
<i>My family was the same way.</i>

01:03.792 --> 01:05.125
<i>Look at us.</i>

01:05.208 --> 01:08.333
<i>You'd never guess how ticked off</i>
<i>we all were the day this was taken.</i>

01:08.417 --> 01:11.041
<i>But that was the thing about us</i>
<i>Van De Kamps.</i>

01:11.125 --> 01:15.834
<i>To really fit in, you had to have</i>
<i>a smile that gave away nothing.</i>

01:18.709 --> 01:20.333
<i>Like my son, Andrew.</i>

01:20.417 --> 01:23.375
<i>To look at him, you'd never know</i>
<i>he spent six months on the streets,</i>

01:23.458 --> 01:27.333
<i>supporting himself</i>
<i>with panhandling and light prostitution.</i>

01:27.417 --> 01:29.000
<i>Or my daughter, Danielle.</i>

01:29.083 --> 01:30.917
<i>Does she look like the kind of girl</i>

01:31.000 --> 01:34.333
<i>who'd seduce</i>
<i>her middle-aged history teacher?</i>

01:34.417 --> 01:36.875
<i>I mean, they're my kids</i>
<i>and I love them,</i>

01:36.959 --> 01:39.875
<i>but I'm pretty darn relieved to be dead.</i>

01:40.875 --> 01:44.750
<i>Here's the clown</i>
<i>Bree replaced me with, Orson.</i>

01:46.000 --> 01:50.208
<i>I don't mind saying, he's</i>
<i>creeped me out right from the get go.</i>

01:53.625 --> 01:56.000
<i>To me, he always has</i>
<i>the shifty look of a guy</i>

01:56.083 --> 01:58.959
<i>who knows</i>
<i>where the bodies are buried.</i>

01:59.041 --> 02:01.208
<i>And he should know.</i>

02:01.291 --> 02:03.208
<i>He buried them.</i>

02:03.291 --> 02:06.417
<i>But Bree thinks he's Sir Galahad.</i>

02:06.500 --> 02:08.291
<i>The kids like him.</i>

02:10.125 --> 02:14.583
<i>And all my friends, now his friends.</i>

02:14.667 --> 02:18.208
<i>So it pleases me to know that</i>
<i>at least one of my old neighbours</i>

02:18.291 --> 02:20.917
<i>sees right through the guy.</i>

02:21.000 --> 02:23.709
Mike, you just missed Bree.

02:23.792 --> 02:25.291
She's off to see her folks,

02:25.375 --> 02:28.166
then we're finally
taking our honeymoon.

02:28.250 --> 02:31.458
Yeah, not a bad time
for you to leave town, is it?

02:31.542 --> 02:33.709
Well, I don't follow you.

02:33.792 --> 02:36.458
I just keep thinking
about that night at Monique's place.

02:36.542 --> 02:39.208
How you made sure
I left with my wrench,

02:39.291 --> 02:40.667
the one with her blood on it.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.875
Well, it was your wrench.

02:44.083 --> 02:45.959
Why are you rehashing this?

02:46.041 --> 02:48.291
My ex-wife confessed
in her suicide note,

02:48.375 --> 02:50.250
the case is closed.

02:50.333 --> 02:53.125
Maybe it shouldn't be.

02:53.208 --> 02:57.583
What do you think the police would say
if they knew you were there that night?

02:57.667 --> 03:01.583
What do you think they'd say
if they knew you threw me off a roof?

03:03.458 --> 03:05.375
Oh, Mike.

03:05.458 --> 03:08.375
We could make
so much trouble for each other.

03:08.458 --> 03:11.083
Or we can forget
what we think we know

03:11.166 --> 03:13.208
and be good neighbours.

03:14.417 --> 03:15.792
Your call.

03:19.041 --> 03:24.333
<i>No, Orson Hodge isn't exactly the guy</i>
<i>I'd have picked to head my family.</i>

03:24.417 --> 03:27.417
<i>But I'll give him one thing.</i>

03:27.500 --> 03:30.208
<i>He's got the smile down cold.</i>

04:13.959 --> 04:16.667
<i>Take a drive</i>
<i>down any street in suburbia.</i>

04:16.750 --> 04:19.041
<i>Know what you're gonna see?</i>

04:19.125 --> 04:21.000
<i>Desperate women.</i>

04:21.083 --> 04:22.500
<i>That's right.</i>

04:22.583 --> 04:26.375
<i>One unhappy housewife after another.</i>

04:26.458 --> 04:30.333
<i>Each completely miserable</i>

04:30.417 --> 04:33.542
<i>in her own unique way.</i>

04:33.625 --> 04:35.625
<i>But I don't want to talk about them.</i>

04:35.709 --> 04:39.000
<i>No, I want to talk about their men.</i>

04:39.083 --> 04:40.875
<i>And what happens to a guy</i>

04:40.959 --> 04:45.166
<i>when that special lady in his life</i>
<i>starts to lose it.</i>

04:45.250 --> 04:47.709
<i>Like my friend Carlos.</i>

04:47.792 --> 04:49.458
<i>He used to have it all.</i>

04:49.542 --> 04:54.083
<i>Hot wife, tons of dough, then bam!</i>

04:54.166 --> 04:57.750
<i>She gets a divorce</i>
<i>and he gets stuck with the bill.</i>

04:57.834 --> 05:01.125
<i>But does he sit around and complain</i>
<i>like your average hausfrau?</i>

05:01.208 --> 05:03.083
<i>No, sir.</i>

05:03.166 --> 05:07.041
<i>He finds creative ways</i>
<i>to get what you can out of life.</i>

05:11.166 --> 05:14.250
- Hey, bro, where you off to?
- Oh, the hospital called.

05:14.333 --> 05:16.458
They found the stuff I had on me
the night of the accident.

05:16.542 --> 05:20.542
Wow. Coma, murder rap.
You've had a tough year, buddy.

05:20.625 --> 05:23.208
You know what you need?
Some pampering.

05:23.291 --> 05:24.750
Tomorrow you're checking into
a nice hotel.

05:24.834 --> 05:27.375
Room service, Jacuzzi, my treat.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.625
You trying to get me out of the house?

05:29.709 --> 05:32.041
Mike, why would I?
Okay, there's this girl.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.333
I knew it.

05:33.417 --> 05:35.750
Dude, she's a dancer.

05:35.834 --> 05:37.917
And if her online profile
is any indication,

05:38.000 --> 05:39.250
she's a complete freak.

05:39.333 --> 05:40.667
We're talking serious Daddy issues.

05:40.750 --> 05:42.875
Look, I'll stay in my room.
You'll never hear me.

05:42.959 --> 05:44.750
Yeah, but you'll hear me.

05:44.834 --> 05:47.875
See, I'm kind of exuberant by nature,
and when I haven't had it in a while,

05:47.959 --> 05:49.667
I kind of do this shrieking thing,
I mean...

05:49.750 --> 05:52.333
Okay, all right, I'll go.
Just stop talking.

05:52.417 --> 05:55.125
Thanks, pal. I wouldn't want it
to put a weird spin on our friendship.

05:55.208 --> 05:56.625
Too late.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.041
<i>This is my friend Tom.</i>

06:01.125 --> 06:05.208
<i>Have you heard</i>
<i>what he's been up to lately?</i>

06:05.291 --> 06:08.250
<i>The silly bastard</i>
<i>opened up his own pizza place.</i>

06:08.333 --> 06:10.333
<i>He thought that</i>
<i>if he was his own boss,</i>

06:10.417 --> 06:13.959
<i>he could sleep in</i>
<i>as late as he wanted.</i>

06:14.083 --> 06:17.083
<i>But the problem with that logic</i>
<i>is that married guys...</i>

06:17.166 --> 06:21.333
Hey, it's after 9:00.
Come on, Tomasino, it's time to get up.

06:21.417 --> 06:23.542
<i>...are never their own boss.</i>

06:24.250 --> 06:26.500
- Are you as tired as I am?
- More.

06:26.583 --> 06:29.917
But I'm tougher, and I complain less.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.583
Not when you give birth.
And you do that a lot.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.417
Oh, yeah?

06:34.500 --> 06:37.417
Before I forget,
you got a call from Chez Nous

06:37.500 --> 06:41.041
confirming your reservation
for our anniversary.

06:41.125 --> 06:43.458
You heard that?
I wanted that to be a surprise.

06:43.542 --> 06:45.875
Well, we've been going there
for the last seven years.

06:45.959 --> 06:48.208
It's not exactly a surprise.

06:48.291 --> 06:52.250
Anyway, I hope you don't mind,
but I cancelled.

06:54.583 --> 06:56.583
You cancelled? Why?

06:56.667 --> 06:59.959
Honestly, I just don't feel up to
going out this year.

07:00.041 --> 07:02.625
But it's our anniversary.
It's our ninth anniversary.

07:02.709 --> 07:03.917
Come on, the big nine.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.625
That's a year longer than my mom said
we would be married.

07:07.709 --> 07:10.458
Come on, we gotta party down.

07:11.458 --> 07:14.792
I'm exhausted. Honestly.

07:14.875 --> 07:17.875
All I want to do is
pawn the kids off on somebody else,

07:17.959 --> 07:20.834
take a long bath and be in bed by 8:00.

07:22.291 --> 07:24.542
- Okay.
- Oh, thank you.

07:24.625 --> 07:26.542
Thank you. Thank you.

07:28.959 --> 07:30.333
Hold it.

07:31.500 --> 07:35.250
What about my sex?
I always get sex on our anniversary.

07:35.333 --> 07:38.375
We can still have sex.
Just try not to wake me.

07:43.125 --> 07:45.166
<i>This is Ian.</i>

07:45.250 --> 07:49.083
<i>Don't really know the guy,</i>
<i>but Susan Mayer seems to like him.</i>

07:50.208 --> 07:53.041
<i>The other night</i>
<i>he surprised her with a proposal.</i>

07:53.125 --> 07:56.750
<i>She said yes,</i>
<i>but he's still a little skittish</i>

07:56.834 --> 07:59.041
<i>about the competition.</i>

07:59.125 --> 08:01.667
<i>But Ian knows that if love is war...</i>

08:01.750 --> 08:04.208
Hey. Where were you off to
so early this morning?

08:04.291 --> 08:07.542
<i>...sometimes you gotta</i>
<i>bring out the big artillery.</i>

08:10.583 --> 08:15.041
I should've had it when I proposed.
It's not very good form, I know.

08:15.125 --> 08:18.458
Ian, oh, you can't be serious!

08:18.542 --> 08:21.125
Oh, that's just too much! It's huge!

08:21.208 --> 08:22.875
Well, we could go smaller.

08:22.959 --> 08:26.625
Oh, no. No one's saying smaller.
No, that's crazy talk.

08:30.166 --> 08:31.458
Rock me.

08:34.500 --> 08:38.208
Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, it's so beautiful!

08:39.458 --> 08:41.959
Oh! Oh! Oh, okay! Okay, nobody move!

08:45.792 --> 08:47.041
I got it!

08:47.125 --> 08:48.500
I knew I should have
measured your finger.

08:48.583 --> 08:51.166
No, it's okay. I can get it resized.

08:51.250 --> 08:52.875
You should go to
the jeweller's right now.

08:52.959 --> 08:54.125
And when you get back, we can go

08:54.208 --> 08:55.625
and look at some places
for the reception.

08:55.709 --> 08:56.875
- Reception?
- Yes.

08:56.959 --> 08:59.667
I was hoping we could
pull this together for next month.

08:59.750 --> 09:02.875
- What's the rush? Am I pregnant?
- Of course not.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.834
I just... I just can't wait
to be married to you.

09:05.917 --> 09:08.834
Are you sure?
You seem a little anxious.

09:08.917 --> 09:11.709
What would I have
to be anxious about?

09:17.083 --> 09:20.250
Again, sorry for the mix-up.
If you could just sign right here.

09:20.333 --> 09:23.041
I don't remember this.
Are you sure that's mine?

09:23.125 --> 09:25.125
It was on you
the night you were admitted.

09:25.208 --> 09:26.875
I got hit by a car.

09:26.959 --> 09:29.166
I don't remember anything
about that night.

09:29.250 --> 09:32.500
Well, it looks like you were
gonna propose to someone.

09:34.291 --> 09:36.500
"Susan, be mine forever. Mike."

09:39.417 --> 09:41.083
Does that ring a bell?

09:45.750 --> 09:47.250
It sure does.

09:51.375 --> 09:52.834
Hey, Carlos!

09:54.667 --> 09:55.750
Hi.

09:55.834 --> 09:59.333
I have a little visitor that I thought
you might get a kick out of seeing.

09:59.417 --> 10:01.291
Remember my little boy?

10:01.375 --> 10:05.041
Hey, Travers. How are you doing?
Put her there!

10:05.125 --> 10:06.375
I'm Carlos Solis.

10:06.458 --> 10:08.709
I think you came by my house
one time trick-or-treating.

10:08.792 --> 10:11.917
I remember.
You gave me a protein bar.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.667
Right.

10:13.750 --> 10:16.250
Sorry. My wife forgot to buy candy.

10:17.291 --> 10:20.792
Hey, is that football I hear?
Go on, check it out.

10:22.667 --> 10:24.583
I didn't know your son
was coming for a visit.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.208
Neither did I.

10:30.834 --> 10:33.875
His father just dumped him here
for four weeks

10:33.959 --> 10:36.917
so he could jet off with
his Doctors Without Borders buddies

10:37.000 --> 10:39.208
and fix cleft palates in Kenya.

10:39.291 --> 10:40.959
Selfish son of a bitch.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.291
Oh, come on. I mean,
you barely even see him. It'll be fun.

10:43.375 --> 10:45.959
- A chance to bond.
- Yeah, that's true.

10:46.041 --> 10:51.667
But I have this major party tonight,
and I was wondering if, maybe,

10:51.750 --> 10:54.375
you could just keep an eye on him
for a few hours.

10:54.458 --> 10:58.041
- Sorry, I can't tonight.
- Oh, come on. You love kids.

10:58.125 --> 11:01.375
Didn't you rent that Chinese chick so
that you could have one of your own?

11:01.458 --> 11:02.709
I have a date, too,

11:02.792 --> 11:06.500
with a chick so hot I had to turn off
the smoke alarms in my house.

11:06.583 --> 11:10.000
Fine. Travers, come on, let's go.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.375
This isn't a child-friendly house.

11:18.834 --> 11:20.291
Bye, Travers.

11:24.333 --> 11:26.000
Good to see you.

11:31.709 --> 11:34.083
- Wow. She's a looker.
- I'll say.

11:36.500 --> 11:40.000
- Hey, what time's that fundraiser?
- You got an hour.

11:40.083 --> 11:42.917
Well, then, let's have a little fun.

11:56.333 --> 11:57.750
Look what you did!

11:57.834 --> 11:59.792
Don't yell at me. I'm just the passenger.

11:59.875 --> 12:01.250
Well, your driver's an idiot.

12:01.333 --> 12:02.792
Hey, it's not Clyde's fault.

12:02.875 --> 12:06.125
I mean, what man
wouldn't be distracted by such beauty?

12:06.208 --> 12:09.166
Now you're hitting on me?

12:09.250 --> 12:11.834
I was talking about the car.

12:11.917 --> 12:15.083
Well, good, I'm glad you like it
'cause you're gonna pay to fix this.

12:15.166 --> 12:18.125
Of course. Will $5,000 cover it?

12:18.208 --> 12:20.250
$5,000?

12:20.333 --> 12:22.583
Well, sure, I guess.

12:22.667 --> 12:24.625
I'd rather not file an insurance claim.

12:24.709 --> 12:26.875
My opponent could find out
and try to make me look bad.

12:26.959 --> 12:28.125
Opponent?

12:28.208 --> 12:29.625
Oh, well, I guess
you don't read the papers.

12:29.709 --> 12:32.375
I'm running for mayor.
My name's Victor Lang.

12:32.458 --> 12:35.792
And I hope I can count on your vote.

12:35.875 --> 12:37.834
I think I'd rather vote for the other guy.

12:37.917 --> 12:40.667
You know, the one
who didn't wreck my car.

12:46.625 --> 12:49.000
You're off your game.
Didn't even get a phone number.

12:49.083 --> 12:51.583
Oh, don't worry,
I'll be seeing her again.

12:51.667 --> 12:55.083
- How can you be so sure?
- I didn't sign the cheque.

13:07.375 --> 13:09.625
- What the hell are you doing?
- We need to talk.

13:09.750 --> 13:12.458
- No! We don't! Get out!
- Please. You won't return my calls!

13:12.542 --> 13:16.083
Well, I've been busy. Plus, my mom
caught you naked on top of my friend.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.500
Just read this.

13:19.583 --> 13:23.709
If you still don't want to talk to me,
then I'll never bother you again.

13:23.792 --> 13:25.041
Fine, I'll read it.

13:25.125 --> 13:27.083
But only if you
get out of the car right now.

13:27.166 --> 13:31.250
- Now? But the hot wax is starting.
- I know. Tick-tock.

13:44.542 --> 13:45.792
You're still in there?

13:45.875 --> 13:47.625
How long does it take
to pluck that unibrow?

13:47.709 --> 13:49.250
Leave me alone!

13:49.333 --> 13:51.375
Danielle, I have to be at work
in 10 minutes.

13:51.458 --> 13:53.875
Now, can I please just come in
and brush my teeth?

13:53.959 --> 13:57.917
I'm having a really bad day, all right?
Just go away!

13:58.000 --> 13:59.834
Look, I'm gonna have
a really bad day, too!

13:59.917 --> 14:02.709
I tend not to get tipped
when my breath stinks.

14:04.792 --> 14:06.333
I'm pregnant.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.000
Mike. What are you doing here?

14:21.083 --> 14:25.041
Oh, hey.
I'm just selling some old jewellery.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.875
I spoke to my manager.

14:26.959 --> 14:28.709
There's gonna be a charge
to remove the inscription,

14:28.792 --> 14:32.291
but we can refund you
for the engagement ring.

14:32.375 --> 14:34.083
That'll be fine.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.333
- Was that the ring that you bought for...
- Yeah.

14:40.875 --> 14:42.667
Can I help you?

14:42.750 --> 14:46.709
Yeah, I have to get this sized.
It's a little loose.

14:46.792 --> 14:48.959
- Do you know your size?
- No.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.750
Congratulations, by the way.

14:52.834 --> 14:56.417
- Ian seems great.
- Thanks.

14:57.083 --> 14:59.709
I can't find my sizer.

14:59.792 --> 15:03.166
- Here, try this one.
- Oh, no! That...

15:06.291 --> 15:07.792
How's that fit?

15:13.792 --> 15:16.417
- It's perfect.
- Great.

15:22.458 --> 15:26.667
- Can I have it back now?
- Oh. Sorry.

15:40.125 --> 15:43.000
Hey, you've got a cousin
in the limo business, don't you?

15:43.083 --> 15:44.125
Actually, I've got a cousin

15:44.208 --> 15:46.959
in the limo-as-a-front-for-prostitution
business.

15:47.291 --> 15:48.625
He's in jail. Why do you ask?

15:48.709 --> 15:51.792
Oh, I'm just planning a big thing
for my anniversary.

15:51.875 --> 15:54.250
Aren't you just gonna go to
Chez Boring like you do every year?

15:54.333 --> 15:58.542
No. Lynette's so over that,
she was ready to bag the whole night.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.500
So it got me thinking.

16:01.333 --> 16:04.500
Nine years, time to shake things up.

16:04.583 --> 16:08.166
Now I'm planning
the greatest anniversary of all time.

16:10.208 --> 16:11.750
Check this out.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.041
<i>Lynette's gonna open the door</i>

16:13.125 --> 16:16.083
<i>to find a limo driver</i>
<i>with a dozen roses and a card.</i>

16:16.166 --> 16:19.583
<i>The card is gonna tell her</i>
<i>to go with the guy,</i>

16:19.667 --> 16:21.417
<i>not ask any questions.</i>

16:21.500 --> 16:26.875
<i>He'll drive her out to the country,</i>
<i>he'll drop her off, then drive away.</i>

16:26.959 --> 16:29.500
<i>Just as she is starting to freak out,</i>

16:29.583 --> 16:32.250
<i>I show up in a horse-drawn carriage,</i>

16:33.500 --> 16:37.000
<i>which takes us up to Whitman's Bluff</i>
<i>where we eat a catered dinner,</i>

16:37.083 --> 16:40.166
<i>listen to a professional violinist.</i>

16:40.250 --> 16:43.041
<i>Afterwards, when we come home,</i>

16:43.125 --> 16:46.166
<i>I'm sure Lynette</i>
<i>will think of a way to thank me.</i>

16:47.750 --> 16:51.792
- You're one romantic son of a bitch.
- I have my moments.

16:53.792 --> 16:56.208
Of course, I'm not questioning
Mayor Johnson's family values.

16:56.291 --> 16:58.834
I'm sure they're what prompted him
to put his sister's brother-in-law

16:58.917 --> 17:01.625
and six of his cousins
on the city payroll.

17:05.583 --> 17:08.291
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to cut this interview short.

17:08.375 --> 17:11.875
I have some very important business
to attend to.

17:11.959 --> 17:15.834
Ms Solis, what a nice surprise.

17:15.917 --> 17:17.959
Are you here to make a contribution
to my campaign?

17:18.041 --> 17:20.375
Not exactly.

17:20.458 --> 17:23.375
Oh, no. Did I forget to...

17:23.458 --> 17:27.000
I'm so sorry. Let me make it up to you.

17:27.083 --> 17:29.333
I'll take you to dinner. My treat.

17:29.417 --> 17:34.166
It would be your treat. I'm a hot date.
What's in it for me?

17:34.250 --> 17:37.000
Well, I have an ingratiating wit,

17:37.083 --> 17:40.625
a trustworthy smile,
according to the <i>Plainview Herald.</i>

17:40.709 --> 17:42.583
Yeah. Cheque, please.

17:45.709 --> 17:49.625
My family also owns Lang Enterprises.

17:49.709 --> 17:52.625
Dad's worth a few hundred mill.

17:56.166 --> 17:58.083
Well, a girl's gotta eat.

18:00.291 --> 18:02.959
Great, I'll take us to Cucina.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.625
There's no place harder to get into.

18:05.709 --> 18:07.667
That's what you think.

18:10.500 --> 18:13.125
Mike, this is completely unnecessary.

18:13.208 --> 18:15.166
My paying for your lawyer
was a favour.

18:15.250 --> 18:17.250
- It wasn't a loan.
- I appreciate it.

18:17.333 --> 18:18.625
But I just don't like to owe anybody.

18:18.709 --> 18:21.959
Well, I just don't want you to have
any trouble getting back on your feet.

18:22.041 --> 18:25.291
No, it's fine. I had a windfall.

18:25.375 --> 18:27.125
Hospital gave me back
an engagement ring

18:27.208 --> 18:28.458
I didn't even know I had.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.375
Oh, really? So you sold it?

18:30.458 --> 18:33.709
You should've kept it
till the right girl comes along.

18:33.792 --> 18:37.000
Well, I couldn't give this ring
to just anyone.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.250
Oh, right. The inscription.

18:43.959 --> 18:46.125
How'd you know it was inscribed?

18:46.208 --> 18:49.333
Well, isn't that the custom?
I just assumed it was.

18:52.208 --> 18:54.834
Well, listen,
I've got to get some fresh rags.

18:54.917 --> 18:57.625
Thanks for the cheque.
I'll see you around.

19:01.917 --> 19:03.792
Oh, you can count on it.

19:05.083 --> 19:08.834
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I peed on five different sticks.

19:10.333 --> 19:13.000
Would you put that burrito away?
It's making me nauseous.

19:13.083 --> 19:14.709
Join the club.

19:14.792 --> 19:17.208
Look, I know your parents are religious,
but I know this clinic...

19:17.291 --> 19:20.083
- Absolutely not!
- So what other choice do we have?

19:20.166 --> 19:22.333
Well, gee, you could, like, marry me!

19:22.417 --> 19:24.959
Marry you? I can't stand you.

19:25.083 --> 19:27.542
Oh, nice way to talk
to the mother of your child.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.792
Oh, God. Bathroom.

19:35.583 --> 19:38.250
- Hey.
- Julie. Hi.

19:39.083 --> 19:40.750
- Hey.
- Your door was open.

19:40.834 --> 19:42.375
Can I come in?

19:43.709 --> 19:46.500
- What are you doing here?
- I read your letter.

19:48.667 --> 19:51.667
I had no idea it would be so sweet.

19:51.750 --> 19:54.792
I could really tell
it came from your heart.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.792
I'm embarrassed to admit I cried.

20:01.750 --> 20:04.875
My Aunt Edie sort of
tied one on last night.

20:05.834 --> 20:07.500
Oh.

20:07.583 --> 20:12.291
Anyway, I guess
what I'm saying is okay.

20:12.375 --> 20:15.750
-"Okay"?
- We can try again.

20:15.834 --> 20:17.458
Julie, that's great.

20:17.542 --> 20:19.041
And I wanna talk about this,

20:19.125 --> 20:21.750
but I just kind of
need to take care of my aunt.

20:21.834 --> 20:23.834
- Can I call you tomorrow?
- Sure.

20:25.458 --> 20:28.709
Oh, we're gonna have to
take things slow.

20:28.792 --> 20:32.041
'Cause it'll be a while
before I can trust you again.

20:33.458 --> 20:35.083
I understand.

20:41.333 --> 20:43.291
Thank you, Bruno.
The veal was excellent.

20:43.375 --> 20:46.250
- Feel like dessert?
- No, thank you. I'm stuffed.

20:46.333 --> 20:48.375
Then let me propose a toast.

20:48.458 --> 20:50.000
To a delightful evening,

20:50.083 --> 20:53.000
and to the happy accident
that brought us together.

20:53.083 --> 20:56.208
Victor, you are so full of crap.

20:56.291 --> 20:58.542
- What?
- There was no accident.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.417
I know you told your chauffeur
to ram my car.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.917
Why would I do that?

21:03.000 --> 21:06.125
For the same reason
you "forgot" to sign the cheque.

21:06.208 --> 21:07.959
You've been working me
since the second we met,

21:08.041 --> 21:10.500
and I've been on to you
every step of the way.

21:12.625 --> 21:16.709
What? What's so funny?
I just called you a manipulative jerk.

21:16.792 --> 21:19.709
I think I underestimated you.

21:19.792 --> 21:23.291
I also think this relationship
just got a lot more interesting.

21:23.375 --> 21:26.250
There is no relationship.
This is our last date.

21:26.333 --> 21:28.333
You didn't have any fun?

21:28.417 --> 21:31.041
It was okay.
You know, you told a few good jokes.

21:31.125 --> 21:34.959
You're sort of charming,
you're not bad looking.

21:35.041 --> 21:36.458
I just think I can do better.

21:36.542 --> 21:38.875
Have you not noticed? I'm a catch.

21:38.959 --> 21:41.875
I have noticed
and I'm throwing you back.

21:43.417 --> 21:45.500
Gabby, let me tell you something.

21:45.583 --> 21:49.625
For my whole life,
whenever I've truly wanted something,

21:49.709 --> 21:51.458
I've always gotten it.

21:51.542 --> 21:55.083
And tonight, right around the time you
were calling me a manipulative jerk,

21:55.166 --> 21:59.000
I decided I truly want you.

22:00.375 --> 22:04.583
So brace yourself, the chase is on.

22:04.667 --> 22:08.250
You can chase me all you want,
but trust me,

22:08.333 --> 22:10.542
I'm way too fast for you.

22:16.208 --> 22:20.667
Bruno, I'm gonna marry that girl.

22:26.041 --> 22:27.250
Can I just say something?

22:27.333 --> 22:29.125
You are way hotter
than your online profile.

22:29.208 --> 22:31.583
So many guys say that.

22:41.208 --> 22:44.208
- What's wrong?
- My friend's kid is out there.

22:48.750 --> 22:52.375
Hey, I got an idea. Let's go upstairs.

23:02.583 --> 23:04.333
I should warn you,

23:04.417 --> 23:08.750
my therapist says
I'm sexually compulsive.

23:08.834 --> 23:11.458
This could take hours.

23:11.542 --> 23:15.125
Whatever your issues are,
we will work them out together.

23:22.083 --> 23:24.917
It's almost 11:00.
What is he doing out there by himself?

23:25.000 --> 23:27.834
I'm sure his folks know he's out there.

23:28.959 --> 23:30.959
Now relax.

23:41.250 --> 23:44.291
I'm so sorry.
I will be right back. I promise.

23:47.625 --> 23:49.041
Hey, Travers,
what are you doing out here?

23:49.125 --> 23:52.208
- Where's your mom?
- She had to go visit a sick friend.

23:57.875 --> 23:59.208
Come on.

24:00.208 --> 24:03.583
No way. I didn't come over here
to baby-sit some little brat!

24:03.667 --> 24:06.125
- He can hear you.
- I don't care!

24:07.417 --> 24:11.125
Look, his mother's bound
to be home soon, all right?

24:11.208 --> 24:13.542
Then we can pick up where we left off.

24:13.625 --> 24:16.750
Forget it.
I'm officially no longer in the mood.

24:28.458 --> 24:31.417
Sorry I ruined your date.

24:31.500 --> 24:33.333
That's okay.

24:33.417 --> 24:35.375
She was a very bad lady

24:35.458 --> 24:38.458
who wanted to do
very, very bad things to me.

24:41.375 --> 24:43.125
Good night, Raoul!

25:01.417 --> 25:05.792
- Where the hell have you been?
- Oh, I ducked out.

25:05.875 --> 25:07.917
- Just for an hour.
- That's funny.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.166
'Cause I found Travers wandering
the streets three hours ago.

25:10.250 --> 25:14.000
Look, he was fine when I left.
I just didn't know he'd go outside.

25:14.083 --> 25:15.834
Yeah, you never know
what an eight-year-old's gonna do.

25:15.917 --> 25:18.375
- That's why you supervise them.
- Hey.

25:18.458 --> 25:21.083
You don't get to judge me.
You don't have a kid.

25:21.166 --> 25:24.959
Well, if I did, I'd treat him
a hell of a lot better than you do.

25:25.041 --> 25:26.333
Thank God he lives with his father.

25:26.417 --> 25:29.417
I mean, come on.
What kind of mother are you?

25:33.375 --> 25:37.500
If you are done lecturing me,
I would like my son now.

25:37.583 --> 25:39.417
He's asleep.

25:39.500 --> 25:43.250
Come and get him in the morning
when you're sober.

25:55.250 --> 25:58.291
Hey, buddy! Your mom's here for you!

26:01.166 --> 26:03.875
I know you think I'm a terrible person.

26:03.959 --> 26:05.834
I never said that.

26:05.917 --> 26:09.375
Terrible mother, terrible person.
It's the same thing.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.625
Because no matter what else she does,

26:13.709 --> 26:17.083
if a woman isn't a good mother,
she's a failure, right?

26:22.375 --> 26:26.166
Look, when I had Travers,

26:26.250 --> 26:29.083
I knew I was in over my head.

26:29.166 --> 26:31.333
And when Charles and I split,

26:33.041 --> 26:35.083
I gave him custody

26:36.583 --> 26:40.041
because I wanted my son
to have the best life possible.

26:42.417 --> 26:44.875
And that doesn't make me
a good mother,

26:46.417 --> 26:49.291
but I like to think
it makes me a realistic one.

26:53.500 --> 26:57.125
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, champ.

26:57.208 --> 27:00.500
- I missed you.
- Oh, I missed you, too.

27:01.250 --> 27:02.667
Guess what?

27:02.750 --> 27:05.792
I've got so many fun things
for you to do today.

27:05.875 --> 27:07.125
- Cool.
- Yeah.

27:07.208 --> 27:09.917
- Thanks for the ice cream.
- My pleasure.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.291
I'll see you, little man. Hey.

27:14.583 --> 27:17.417
Travers said he's staying
at least a month.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.083
Yeah.

27:19.166 --> 27:22.333
So if you ever need a babysitter,
just yell.

27:25.458 --> 27:27.291
I appreciate that.

27:30.625 --> 27:33.291
Hey! Wait for me!

27:33.375 --> 27:36.250
No, I don't want a viola player.
I asked for a violinist.

27:36.333 --> 27:39.041
I don't even know what a viola is.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.083
Oh, it's just a big violin?

27:41.166 --> 27:44.333
Okay, yeah, sure.
Okay, I'll see you at 8:00.

27:46.083 --> 27:50.875
- What was that?
- It's just a little surprise, okay?

27:50.959 --> 27:54.709
- Let it go.
-"Let it go." That's cute.

27:54.792 --> 27:56.250
Start talking.

27:56.333 --> 27:59.750
I planned a little something
for our anniversary.

27:59.834 --> 28:02.542
That is all I'm gonna say.

28:02.625 --> 28:04.875
Okay. Okay. Okay.

28:04.959 --> 28:07.834
If we're doing this,
I need to buy you something.

28:07.917 --> 28:09.875
- What do you want?
- You don't have to buy me anything.

28:09.959 --> 28:11.917
You didn't have to plan anything,
but you did.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.583
Even though we had an agreement.
You like ties? You're getting a tie.

28:15.667 --> 28:19.250
- What are you getting so upset about?
- I have been dragging my ass all day.

28:19.333 --> 28:22.333
And the only thought
that's kept me going is the hot bath.

28:22.417 --> 28:25.875
And now I have to do my hair
and shave my legs.

28:25.959 --> 28:28.959
So, what do you want to do, Lynette?
Just tell me what you want.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.291
I told you what I want.

28:31.375 --> 28:36.208
Hot bath, bed early.
But you chose not to listen.

28:36.291 --> 28:38.333
Well, okay, I guess
I can just cancel the whole thing.

28:38.417 --> 28:40.083
You can have
your dream evening alone,

28:40.166 --> 28:42.333
and I'll get up
a poker game or something.

28:42.417 --> 28:43.792
Thank you.

28:45.542 --> 28:48.792
Hey, you know what?
I've been dragging my ass all day, too.

28:48.875 --> 28:50.583
And you know what got me through it?

28:50.667 --> 28:53.291
The idea of doing something special
with you.

28:55.166 --> 28:56.875
Happy anniversary.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.625
All right, I'm off to join your mother.

29:05.709 --> 29:07.792
The hotel number's on the fridge
in case there's a problem.

29:07.875 --> 29:11.041
Bree said her cell phone
isn't getting good reception.

29:11.125 --> 29:14.166
Actually, we kind of
already have a problem.

29:14.250 --> 29:15.625
Well, I'm already late for my flight.

29:15.709 --> 29:17.792
Can this wait a few weeks
till we're back?

29:17.875 --> 29:20.417
- Yeah, this could wait a few weeks.
- Oh, good.

29:20.500 --> 29:24.458
I mean, heck, this particular problem
could wait nine months.

29:28.875 --> 29:30.583
Good Lord.

29:32.125 --> 29:34.458
- How was your bath?
- Oh, I couldn't relax.

29:34.542 --> 29:38.083
I just kept replaying the fight
I had with Tom in my head.

29:38.166 --> 29:41.000
Well, at least your husband
tries to be romantic.

29:41.083 --> 29:43.417
Every anniversary,
Gilbert bought me an appliance.

29:43.500 --> 29:46.041
On the last one,
he gave me a vacuum cleaner.

29:46.125 --> 29:49.291
He died two weeks later. I didn't cry.

29:50.875 --> 29:52.125
Wow.

29:54.041 --> 29:56.083
Who could that be? Here.

29:59.375 --> 30:01.083
All right, here's what we're thinking.

30:01.166 --> 30:05.959
Clearly, the idea of the two of you
getting married is ridiculous.

30:06.041 --> 30:09.834
- So, what do you want me to do?
- Glad you asked.

30:09.917 --> 30:14.583
Bree and I have decided that Danielle
will join us on our honeymoon.

30:14.667 --> 30:18.333
When we return, we'll tell our friends
she's decided to study abroad.

30:18.417 --> 30:21.458
Once the baby's born
and adopted by a suitable family,

30:21.542 --> 30:23.250
she'll come home.

30:25.959 --> 30:28.083
- What about me?
- You leave.

30:28.166 --> 30:29.458
Leave?

30:29.542 --> 30:31.709
Get out of Fairview
and don't tell a soul why,

30:31.792 --> 30:32.917
not even your aunt.

30:32.959 --> 30:34.583
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

30:34.667 --> 30:37.166
Because I've got responsibilities here.
People are counting on me.

30:37.250 --> 30:38.792
Yeah, well,
you should've thought of that

30:38.875 --> 30:40.500
before you impregnated
my stepdaughter.

30:40.583 --> 30:45.375
- I said I'm not leaving!
- Oh, easy there, Turbo.

30:45.458 --> 30:47.417
We'll be right back.

30:53.542 --> 30:56.250
So, who exactly is counting on you?

30:56.333 --> 30:59.208
- Julie Mayer, maybe?
- She gave me another chance.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.166
I can't leave
if I've still got a shot with her.

31:01.250 --> 31:04.083
And what's gonna happen when Julie
finds out you knocked up my sister?

31:04.166 --> 31:07.250
Didn't your step-dad just say
no one's gonna find out about that?

31:08.583 --> 31:11.333
Okay, try this.

31:12.250 --> 31:14.208
Julie's a nice girl.

31:14.291 --> 31:17.834
And you, well, you're a dog.

31:22.583 --> 31:24.709
No knock.

31:24.792 --> 31:27.625
I'm a dog lover, myself.

31:27.709 --> 31:30.000
But Julie deserves better.

31:30.083 --> 31:32.375
You know you'll just end up
cheating on her.

31:32.458 --> 31:34.625
No, I won't hurt her again.

31:35.792 --> 31:37.333
Sure you will.

31:38.542 --> 31:43.000
Not right away.
Maybe you'll hold out for six months.

31:43.083 --> 31:46.458
But then it'll hurt her even more.

31:46.542 --> 31:48.041
Am I wrong?

31:50.792 --> 31:52.625
You just have to ask yourself

31:52.709 --> 31:56.208
if you can be the kind of guy
she needs you to be.

31:56.291 --> 31:59.667
And if you can't, walk away.

32:10.542 --> 32:16.500
Beer is on the house, guys.
Drink fast, get stupid, lose money.

32:16.583 --> 32:18.291
- Mike!
- Hey.

32:18.375 --> 32:22.250
Hey, buddy.
Hey, you know Orson, right?

32:22.333 --> 32:24.417
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, neighbour.

32:24.500 --> 32:28.750
Hey, so, let's get started, huh?
Five card stud, $2 ante.

32:28.834 --> 32:32.250
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Ian!

32:32.333 --> 32:36.083
- Hey, Ian.
- Nice to see you, Mike.

32:40.667 --> 32:43.208
What is fish and chips doing here?

32:43.291 --> 32:44.583
Susan asked me to include him.

32:44.667 --> 32:46.458
Said he always wanted to learn
how to play poker.

32:46.542 --> 32:49.792
So we're gonna give him
some very expensive lessons.

32:49.875 --> 32:52.834
Be careful.
He already knows how to bluff.

32:58.750 --> 33:02.458
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it going?

33:02.542 --> 33:04.875
Good, good.

33:04.959 --> 33:08.166
I just wanted to tell you,
I have to leave town for a while.

33:08.250 --> 33:12.375
- Really? Is something wrong?
- No, no, no, it's just family stuff.

33:15.625 --> 33:18.917
I don't know exactly when I'll be back.

33:18.959 --> 33:21.291
It could be a while, though.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.166
Oh.

33:26.041 --> 33:27.375
Okay.

33:27.458 --> 33:30.291
I just want you to know
that it means a lot

33:30.375 --> 33:33.667
that you were willing
to give me a second chance.

33:34.959 --> 33:38.083
You're like the only person
that's ever done that.

33:38.166 --> 33:40.750
Austin, what's going on?

33:41.834 --> 33:43.709
Nothing. It's just...

33:45.333 --> 33:46.875
I have to go.

33:49.375 --> 33:50.959
Goodbye, Julie.

33:53.875 --> 33:55.125
Austin!

34:17.792 --> 34:19.375
I'll raise you.

34:22.875 --> 34:24.750
I'm out.

34:24.834 --> 34:28.333
Another courageous move
from Foldilocks.

34:28.417 --> 34:30.000
I'll call you.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.792
Flush, king high.

34:34.250 --> 34:36.583
Full house, sevens and knaves.

34:36.667 --> 34:39.709
Jacks! We call them jacks!

34:39.792 --> 34:42.500
Boy, this is your lucky room.

34:42.583 --> 34:46.083
Yes, I heard about your engagement,
the other night. Congratulations.

34:46.166 --> 34:48.959
Yeah, about that, Ian.

34:49.041 --> 34:52.834
Was that proposal spontaneous
or did you have it all planned?

34:52.917 --> 34:56.750
Oh, it was entirely planned.
I thought it'd be the ideal occasion.

34:56.834 --> 35:00.333
Oh, if it was planned,
why didn't you have a ring?

35:00.417 --> 35:03.583
Well, I thought Susan might like
to choose the ring herself.

35:03.667 --> 35:04.875
Ante up, boys.

35:04.959 --> 35:08.291
So why'd she pick a ring
that was too big for her?

35:10.083 --> 35:12.166
How did you know that?

35:12.250 --> 35:14.375
Guys, guys, guys, guys,
we came here to play cards.

35:14.458 --> 35:16.709
- Why are we talking about jewellery?
- Sorry, Tom.

35:16.792 --> 35:20.291
But I just found out
I bought a ring for Susan myself.

35:20.375 --> 35:24.041
It was in my pocket that night
some son of a bitch ran me over.

35:24.125 --> 35:27.375
Tom's right.
We should focus on the game.

35:27.458 --> 35:30.959
After our talk, I called the hospital.

35:31.041 --> 35:33.834
They said my ring
got in with your wife's stuff.

35:33.917 --> 35:38.083
So you saw it before I did,
the same day you proposed to Susan.

35:40.166 --> 35:41.542
And your point is?

35:41.625 --> 35:43.917
That that's why
you were in such a big hurry.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.291
You wanted to seal the deal before
I found out about the ring and told her.

35:49.959 --> 35:53.583
- Do you think I'm afraid of you?
- Maybe you should be.

35:53.667 --> 35:55.125
What do you think Susan would say

35:55.208 --> 35:59.000
if she found out why your proposal
was so spontaneous?

35:59.083 --> 36:02.458
- Guys, can we just play?
- I'm trying.

36:04.208 --> 36:05.458
Fine.

36:06.709 --> 36:07.917
Deal.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.000
- Hello.
<i>- Mr Scavo?</i>

36:18.083 --> 36:20.000
It's Lamar from the limo service.

36:20.083 --> 36:23.959
I got a flat, so I might be late
picking up you and your wife.

36:24.041 --> 36:26.166
What are you talking about?
I cancelled you.

36:26.250 --> 36:29.041
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did. I left you a message.

36:29.125 --> 36:30.750
Oh, I must have missed it.

36:30.834 --> 36:34.125
Anyway, I dropped your wife off
right where you told me.

36:34.208 --> 36:36.875
- Oh, God, when?
- About two hours ago.

36:42.834 --> 36:45.250
Guys, lock up when you're done!

36:49.834 --> 36:51.250
I'll open.

36:52.917 --> 36:55.333
- I'm out.
- And I'll raise you.

37:00.625 --> 37:01.792
You want a beer?

37:01.875 --> 37:05.083
Hell, Tom's gone.
Let's go open up the good stuff.

37:09.041 --> 37:13.792
Well, looks like it's just you and me,
if you're still in.

37:15.208 --> 37:17.458
With this hand? You bet I am.

37:20.166 --> 37:21.792
I'll re-raise.

37:28.959 --> 37:30.709
And raise again.

37:33.500 --> 37:36.083
Your stack's looking kind of small.

37:44.917 --> 37:47.834
Will you take a cheque?

37:47.917 --> 37:50.709
You know I can't match that.

37:50.792 --> 37:52.875
How about this then?

37:52.959 --> 37:57.208
You win, you keep the money
and you tell Susan whatever you want.

37:57.291 --> 37:59.959
I win, you keep your mouth shut
about the ring

38:00.041 --> 38:02.500
and you leave me and Susan alone.

38:15.542 --> 38:16.709
Deal.

38:31.041 --> 38:32.750
How was the game?

38:33.750 --> 38:35.083
I won.

38:48.333 --> 38:51.417
Lynette, I am so sorry! I am so sorry!

38:53.208 --> 38:57.291
You see, there was supposed to be
a horse-drawn carriage and...

38:57.375 --> 38:59.625
Oh, good, you got the flowers.

39:13.041 --> 39:15.166
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

39:17.709 --> 39:20.000
Yeah, she likes coffee, too. Thanks.

39:22.625 --> 39:24.834
Look, I'm really, really, really sorry...

39:24.917 --> 39:27.041
Please stop apologising.

39:27.125 --> 39:29.125
I appreciate what you were trying to do.

39:29.208 --> 39:33.834
It was a lovely thought that just went
hideously, hideously, hideously wrong.

39:36.125 --> 39:38.458
Wait till the kids find out
that you saw a real coyote.

39:38.542 --> 39:39.917
Hideously.

39:44.291 --> 39:46.208
Well, I learned my lesson.

39:46.291 --> 39:47.959
Never again. No more surprises.

39:48.041 --> 39:50.750
From now on,
I'll do exactly what you say.

39:54.333 --> 39:57.834
Oh, don't you dare.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.333
What?

40:00.417 --> 40:03.125
I had a lot of time to think tonight.

40:03.208 --> 40:05.750
And I realised, you were right.

40:05.834 --> 40:10.750
We have to keep the romance going,
no matter how tired we are.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.375
The only thing worse
than just going through the motions

40:15.458 --> 40:19.000
is not bothering
to go through the motions.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.208
So you want me
to surprise you next year?

40:24.291 --> 40:26.291
Knock yourself out.

40:26.375 --> 40:29.625
Just wait, 'cause I will think
of something even better.

40:29.709 --> 40:31.250
Well, after this year,

40:31.333 --> 40:36.083
I would be happy with any date
that included food and shelter.

40:49.166 --> 40:50.583
Nine years.

40:55.166 --> 40:56.583
Nine years.

40:57.959 --> 41:00.667
And I have loved every minute of it.

41:02.417 --> 41:03.792
Me, too.

41:12.417 --> 41:15.625
<i>Take a drive</i>
<i>down any street in suburbia.</i>

41:15.709 --> 41:17.875
<i>Know what you're gonna see?</i>

41:19.041 --> 41:22.125
<i>A bunch of guys</i>
<i>wearing the same expression.</i>

41:23.333 --> 41:25.333
<i>It's a look that says,</i>

41:25.417 --> 41:29.959
<i>"Oh, crap. My dreams</i>
<i>are never going to come true."</i>

41:33.583 --> 41:36.542
<i>"I'll never have a life</i>
<i>free from scandal."</i>

41:39.041 --> 41:41.583
<i>"I'll never have a son of my own."</i>

41:43.750 --> 41:46.458
<i>"I'll never hold her in my arms again."</i>

41:49.667 --> 41:52.709
<i>"I'll never get to tell her how I feel."</i>

41:56.959 --> 42:01.166
<i>Yeah, the suburbs are filled with</i>
<i>a lot of men who've given up hope.</i>

42:03.000 --> 42:06.917
<i>Of course, every once in a while you</i>
<i>do come across some lucky SOB</i>

42:07.000 --> 42:09.417
<i>whose dreams have all come true.</i>

42:11.333 --> 42:13.458
<i>You know how you spot them?</i>

42:14.375 --> 42:17.333
<i>They're the ones</i>
<i>who can't stop smiling.</i>

42:19.625 --> 42:22.166
<i>Don't you just hate those guys?</i>
