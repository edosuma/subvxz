WEBVTT

00:02.782 --> 00:04.248
Okay, you understand
I don't want him

00:04.283 --> 00:05.650
to know-- it's a secret.

00:05.685 --> 00:07.885
But I just want to make sure
that you can...

00:07.920 --> 00:11.789
do that thing
that we talked about.

00:11.824 --> 00:14.225
Okay. I'll call you later.

00:14.260 --> 00:15.226
Okay.

00:15.261 --> 00:17.528
It was a telemarketer.

00:17.563 --> 00:19.430
Oh, you're gonna
call 'em back?

00:20.733 --> 00:23.034
I don't want to be rude.
Oh, no.

00:23.069 --> 00:24.902
God definitely didn't
give you the lying gene.

00:24.937 --> 00:27.938
Well, mendacity
is not God-given.

00:27.974 --> 00:32.009
It is coded into our genetics
and passed down in our gene pool

00:32.045 --> 00:34.812
to ensure Homo sapiens' survival.
Okay, stop.

00:34.847 --> 00:36.914
The whole mumbo jumbo language
that you're giving me right now

00:36.949 --> 00:39.483
is not gonna distract from the
fact that you're lying to me.

00:40.620 --> 00:42.620
I-I was thinking
maybe we shouldn't

00:42.655 --> 00:44.355
have turkey this Thanksgiving.

00:44.390 --> 00:46.791
What? What, what, now
you're trying to, what,

00:46.826 --> 00:48.926
incite a fight to
try to distract me?

00:48.961 --> 00:50.194
Well, there's just
the four of us,

00:50.229 --> 00:51.562
and you're the only one
who eats it.

00:51.597 --> 00:53.330
What are you talking about?
So now you're saying

00:53.366 --> 00:54.799
we should just cut out
the main course

00:54.834 --> 00:56.100
that the whole holiday
is based around?

00:56.135 --> 00:58.035
Are you aware
that turkeys do a dance

00:58.071 --> 01:00.271
when they are reunited
with a person they recognize?

01:00.306 --> 01:01.739
Dance? That's really...
Yes.

01:01.774 --> 01:03.274
That's great, Bones,
but I guarantee you

01:03.309 --> 01:05.309
that they don't dance
as good as they taste.

01:05.343 --> 01:06.510
It's a waste of food, Booth.

01:06.546 --> 01:07.812
My dad will be away with Russ.

01:07.847 --> 01:09.413
There's no one to eat it all.

01:09.449 --> 01:11.782
Oh, hey, problem solved--
we'll invite Aubrey.

01:11.818 --> 01:13.784
I'm serious, Booth.
All right, look.

01:13.820 --> 01:15.920
We'll invite Angela,
we'll invite Hodgins,

01:15.955 --> 01:17.788
we'll invite the squints
and whoever else

01:17.824 --> 01:19.890
wants to join in,
just as long as I get

01:19.926 --> 01:21.392
to stuff the bird, roast him up,

01:21.427 --> 01:23.360
and I can just eat myself
to unconsciousness.

01:23.396 --> 01:25.930
On the couch

01:25.965 --> 01:28.365
while I hear the game.

01:28.401 --> 01:30.735
If you cook the dead bird.
Fine.

01:30.770 --> 01:32.570
Done. Deal.
Okay, so I'll tell you what.

01:32.605 --> 01:34.805
Now that we're over that
diversion, what do you say

01:34.841 --> 01:37.708
we get back to who you were
talking to on the phone.

01:37.744 --> 01:39.243
Oh, well, it's not...
Okay? Wow.

01:39.278 --> 01:40.711
Well, what was it?

01:40.747 --> 01:43.347
Oh.
What, where is this...? What?

01:43.382 --> 01:45.382
Ha. Body.

01:45.418 --> 01:49.019
Uh, Christine,
uh, time to get ready!

01:50.289 --> 01:52.189
Look, I didn't say
that it was a...

01:52.225 --> 01:53.424
it was a bad course.

01:53.459 --> 01:54.959
I just said the greens
are like marble.

01:54.994 --> 01:56.961
The problem is
you don't know how to read it.

01:56.996 --> 01:59.864
Slope, velocity, a little
bit of simple geometry...

01:59.899 --> 02:01.265
It shouldn't be
that difficult, okay?

02:01.300 --> 02:02.633
I mean, shouldn't
be Aristotle

02:02.668 --> 02:04.735
to play a game.
Am I allowed to talk,

02:04.771 --> 02:06.203
or is that
a members-only privilege?

02:06.239 --> 02:07.471
Typically,
caddies don't speak.

02:07.507 --> 02:08.973
Caddy? I'm not your caddy.

02:09.008 --> 02:10.574
And golf isn't a game,
it's a sport.

02:10.610 --> 02:12.042
No, no, no.

02:12.078 --> 02:13.410
There's no defense,
no defense in golf.

02:13.446 --> 02:14.745
No defense, no sport.

02:14.781 --> 02:16.180
What Booth means is that
if I can beat him,

02:16.215 --> 02:17.815
it's not a sport.

02:17.850 --> 02:19.150
What I don't get is that--
you guys played here?

02:19.185 --> 02:20.684
I mean, no one gets in here.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.186
Well, you know,
when you're married

02:22.221 --> 02:23.921
to a, I don't know,
best-selling novelist,

02:23.956 --> 02:25.689
you can get in pretty much
anywhere you want, right?

02:25.725 --> 02:27.224
What if your partner's wife

02:27.260 --> 02:29.193
is a best-selling novelist?
That doesn't count.

02:29.228 --> 02:30.895
Okay, let me change
the subject here, okay?

02:30.930 --> 02:32.196
How about this?

02:32.231 --> 02:33.998
Invite to our house
for Thanksgiving.

02:34.033 --> 02:35.533
Come on, it's a real turkey.

02:35.568 --> 02:38.869
Or a very tasty
Fofurkey recipe

02:38.905 --> 02:40.838
that will change the way you
think about meat substitutes.

02:40.873 --> 02:42.540
Fofurkey?
Not really looking to change

02:42.575 --> 02:44.475
the way I think
about meat substitutes.

02:44.510 --> 02:46.443
Besides, I think
I just lost my appetite.

02:46.479 --> 02:48.179
Okay!

02:48.214 --> 02:49.914
Talk about a water hazard.
How long was he in there?

02:49.949 --> 02:51.215
Well, it's hard to say.

02:51.250 --> 02:52.950
The body was
weighed down.

02:52.985 --> 02:54.385
He was found by
these two guys

02:54.420 --> 02:56.587
who were trawling
for golf balls.

02:56.622 --> 02:58.556
There's brushite
forming all over.

02:58.591 --> 03:01.425
Well, based on hypostasis,
the closest

03:01.460 --> 03:03.227
we can estimate is that
the body's been in the water

03:03.262 --> 03:04.962
about two to
three weeks.

03:04.997 --> 03:07.164
Actually, I think we can
do better than that.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.533
I would say that the body's
been in there two weeks,

03:09.569 --> 03:11.435
four days,
seven hours

03:11.470 --> 03:12.937
and 12 minutes.

03:12.972 --> 03:15.372
And what bug gives you that
precise a time of death?

03:15.408 --> 03:17.208
<i>Timexum horologium.</i>

03:17.243 --> 03:18.776
Wristwatch.

03:18.811 --> 03:20.911
Hey, actually, if we can
figure out when this baby

03:20.947 --> 03:23.013
went dead underwater,
we can probably pinpoint

03:23.049 --> 03:24.949
when the killer dumped this guy.

03:24.984 --> 03:26.417
Uh, girl.

03:26.452 --> 03:27.651
Wear on the
mandibular teeth

03:27.687 --> 03:29.353
suggests an age between

03:29.388 --> 03:31.255
approximately 55 and 60 years.

03:31.290 --> 03:34.825
Oh, and everyone here is invited
to Thanksgiving dinner.

03:34.861 --> 03:38.395
Oh, wow, that is a nice segue there, Bones.
It seemed appropriate.

03:38.431 --> 03:41.866
Human and turkey tissue share
remarkably similar texture.

03:41.901 --> 03:44.768
Meat substitute doesn't sound
too bad right now.

03:44.804 --> 03:47.204
So, a high-end golf course
used only by the one percent

03:47.240 --> 03:48.606
of the one percent.

03:48.641 --> 03:50.608
Maybe the killer
was sending a message.

03:50.643 --> 03:53.444
Or perhaps the killer
was merely being prudent.

03:53.479 --> 03:54.612
Bones is right.
Golf course at night's

03:54.647 --> 03:56.947
gonna be dark and empty.
Gives him about,

03:56.983 --> 03:59.717
what, a 12-hour window to come
in, dump the body and get out.

03:59.752 --> 04:01.252
So, smart kill,

04:01.287 --> 04:03.454
smart method of disposal.

04:05.091 --> 04:07.124
<i>Well, she wasn't a golfer.</i>

04:07.159 --> 04:10.794
Her thoracic vertebrae
are fused, T5 to T7.

04:10.830 --> 04:12.596
You play, Rodolfo?

04:12.632 --> 04:14.031
Where would I?

04:14.066 --> 04:16.433
After Castro took over power,

04:16.469 --> 04:18.601
he bulldozed nearly every course
on the island.

04:18.637 --> 04:21.238
Turned them into public housing
and military schools.

04:21.274 --> 04:23.007
Yeah. Some might say
he was sharing the riches

04:23.042 --> 04:24.875
with the poor. I mean, look
at a club like Washington Hills.

04:24.911 --> 04:26.777
It's, like, one
of the most beautiful places

04:26.812 --> 04:28.979
around, but you can only get in
if you're rich.

04:29.015 --> 04:31.782
Well, maybe so, but any time
you take a thing of beauty

04:31.817 --> 04:34.184
and make it utilitarian,
something is lost.

04:34.220 --> 04:37.488
If you consider a freshly mowed
lawn a thing of beauty.

04:37.523 --> 04:39.323
Besides, I don't think
she was a rich socialite.

04:39.358 --> 04:41.859
I mean, why would a woman
like that be in a war zone?

04:41.894 --> 04:43.060
Is that shrapnel?

04:43.095 --> 04:45.095
Yes. I think
she could be ex-military,

04:45.131 --> 04:46.964
but a woman in her 50s?

04:46.999 --> 04:50.668
There's no way she served
in combat 30 years ago.

04:50.703 --> 04:53.070
There's trace here
of something metallic.

04:53.105 --> 04:55.472
I'll swab, but my guess is
that one of these golf clubs

04:55.508 --> 04:57.374
did the job.
I mean, look at that.

04:57.410 --> 04:58.809
Just jam that jagged edge

04:58.844 --> 05:01.445
into the orbital socket
and, boom, lights out.

05:01.480 --> 05:04.148
Also, the killer knew
the decomp gases

05:04.183 --> 05:06.016
from the stomach
and the intestine

05:06.052 --> 05:07.685
would bring the body
to the surface.

05:07.720 --> 05:08.886
So he carved her open,

05:08.921 --> 05:10.154
like a Thanksgiving turkey.

Oh, is that the victim?

Yeah, well, that's what
she would have looked like

05:50.937 --> 05:52.069
without plastic surgery.

05:52.105 --> 05:53.671
Her facial bones
were shaved.

05:53.706 --> 05:55.640
I'm working on the muscle
reattachment points now.

05:55.675 --> 05:57.975
Also, I found a callous fracture
on her nasal bone.

05:58.011 --> 06:00.044
Oh. So she had a
nose job, too.

06:00.079 --> 06:03.481
And I found sutures
behind the hairline, collagen,

06:03.516 --> 06:06.250
and silicone oozing from the
decomposing tissue of the face.

06:06.285 --> 06:08.352
Well, the golf clubs
aren't our murder weapon.

06:08.388 --> 06:11.522
They were all graphite
composites or steel shafts.

06:11.557 --> 06:14.392
Our weapon was platinum
sterling. It was very expensive,

06:14.427 --> 06:16.827
95.5% silver.

06:16.863 --> 06:19.382
Wow, even murder
doesn't come cheap these days.

06:19.406 --> 06:19.965
I also found traces

06:19.966 --> 06:21.365
of bleach
on her clothes,

06:21.401 --> 06:23.801
so our killer doused the body
before dumping it.

06:23.836 --> 06:26.437
Meaning there's not much left
to point us to the killer.

06:28.741 --> 06:30.341
Oh, no.

06:30.376 --> 06:32.376
No, no, no.

06:32.412 --> 06:34.578
What? Do you know who she is?
You don't recognize

06:34.614 --> 06:36.681
Vivian Prince?
Come on. Front page,

06:36.716 --> 06:39.016
left column
of <i> The DC Sentinel.</i>

06:39.052 --> 06:40.985
She is... was

06:41.020 --> 06:43.354
the finest political reporter
in the country.

06:43.389 --> 06:45.189
She was the one
who broke the NSA story.

06:45.224 --> 06:46.891
Yeah, that's right. She spent
the last six months showing

06:46.926 --> 06:48.893
how the NSA has been spying
on the American people,

06:48.928 --> 06:51.529
world leaders. I mean, they
even have their own hit squad.

06:51.564 --> 06:54.532
She took what Snowden did
and went ten steps beyond.

06:54.567 --> 06:57.535
Well, I guess they found a way
to shut her up.

07:01.941 --> 07:03.841
<i>I know that what she did</i>

07:03.876 --> 07:05.476
was questionable,
but freedom of the press

07:05.511 --> 07:07.745
should not get you killed.
Not in this country.

07:07.780 --> 07:10.514
It wasn't freedom of the press.
Vivian Prince was in the wrong.

07:10.550 --> 07:12.283
She didn't steal the files,
Booth.

07:12.318 --> 07:14.185
Okay, what,
she reprinted stolen documents,

07:14.220 --> 07:15.786
she revealed secret operations,

07:15.822 --> 07:18.322
which outed operatives
all over the world.

07:18.357 --> 07:20.024
But if the NSA
is breaking the law...

07:20.059 --> 07:21.792
Then you go after the people
in charge.

07:21.828 --> 07:23.861
What you don't do
is paint a bull's-eye

07:23.896 --> 07:25.896
on an operative's back.

07:27.133 --> 07:29.800
Well, I checked out
Vivian's ex-husband.

07:29.836 --> 07:31.602
Guy's name is Sal Raymond.

07:31.637 --> 07:34.171
He's a sportswriter. Out
of town covering the Cowboys.

07:34.207 --> 07:35.339
Dallas?

07:35.374 --> 07:37.007
Roanoke Prep.

07:37.043 --> 07:38.943
Let's just say Sal's career
isn't exactly hitting

07:38.978 --> 07:41.412
on all cylinders.
He covers the high school beat.

07:41.447 --> 07:44.048
How bad was the divorce?
Seems like he got

07:44.083 --> 07:45.716
a pretty good settlement.
And while the husband

07:45.752 --> 07:47.752
is usually our best bet,
the fact that our victim

07:47.787 --> 07:50.321
just pissed off the world's
most elite intelligence agency

07:50.356 --> 07:52.790
probably makes her work
a better place to start.

07:52.825 --> 07:54.291
Yeah, right.
I'll give you that one.

07:54.327 --> 07:55.926
I've got Angela combing
through the threats

07:55.962 --> 07:57.962
that the paper got
after the articles ran.

07:57.997 --> 07:59.530
We know who made the threats?

07:59.565 --> 08:02.533
Nope. Not yet.

08:07.540 --> 08:09.306
Hey, it's kind of quiet
for a major newspaper.

08:09.342 --> 08:10.841
Might have something to do
with the fact

08:10.877 --> 08:12.610
that nobody reads
the paper anymore.

08:12.645 --> 08:14.578
Come on, what are you talking
about? I do it every morning.

08:14.614 --> 08:16.413
I got a cup of Joe
in the left hand,

08:16.449 --> 08:19.049
I got the paper in the right.
I can feel the ink on my skin.

08:19.085 --> 08:20.651
Yeah, it's a mess.

08:20.686 --> 08:22.586
Paper, ink, newsp... What?
What are you talking about?

08:22.622 --> 08:24.121
It's a tradition.
You're not getting it.

08:24.157 --> 08:26.056
No, I get it. You're old.
I'm not old.

08:26.092 --> 08:28.292
It's a tradition. Stop.

08:29.195 --> 08:31.128
David Pyne.
Yeah.

08:31.164 --> 08:33.030
Is this about the threats?
Unfortunately not.

08:33.065 --> 08:35.633
Vivian Prince is dead.

08:35.668 --> 08:38.335
They got her.

08:38.371 --> 08:40.837
Who? The people
who wrote in to the paper?

08:40.873 --> 08:43.640
Uh, no, no.
Those were just, uh, crackpots.

08:43.676 --> 08:46.010
Three weeks ago, Vivian exposes
Greystream Solutions

08:46.045 --> 08:49.280
as an NSA hit squad.
Now she's dead. You do the math.

08:49.315 --> 08:52.616
Tell me about Vivian's source
for the documents, The American.

08:52.652 --> 08:56.086
I can't.
I don't know who he or she is.

08:56.122 --> 08:57.888
The American wants
to be anonymous. He doesn't want

08:57.924 --> 08:59.657
to end up in exile like Snowden.

08:59.692 --> 09:03.027
What was I thinking?
Kolfax!

09:03.062 --> 09:05.663
Get in here! Uh,
give me a minute.

09:05.698 --> 09:07.698
If we're not first on the story
of my own reporter

09:07.733 --> 09:08.999
getting killed, I lose my job.

09:10.469 --> 09:12.369
Is this about the threats?

09:13.506 --> 09:14.839
Vivian's dead.

09:14.874 --> 09:16.240
Murdered.

09:16.275 --> 09:18.242
I'm on it.

09:18.277 --> 09:20.711
16 inches on the breaking story,
a sidebar on The American angle,

09:20.746 --> 09:22.179
I'll get Obit to punch up
what they have.

09:22.215 --> 09:24.982
Okay, you don't seem
so choked up about this.

09:25.017 --> 09:27.585
I report the news.
I can't afford to react to it.

09:27.620 --> 09:29.987
So unless you guys are gonna
give me something on the record,

09:30.022 --> 09:31.822
is it okay if I go?
Sure. Go ahead.

09:31.858 --> 09:33.457
But we might have
some questions for you later.

09:33.492 --> 09:35.926
Yeah. After deadline,
ask me anything.

09:35.962 --> 09:38.662
I get the front page left?

09:38.698 --> 09:41.465
Today. We'll talk later.
I think I'm beginning

09:41.500 --> 09:44.401
to see why Vivian felt like she
needed so much plastic surgery.

09:44.437 --> 09:47.605
You had the newer, younger
model waiting in the wings.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.874
I'm in a dying business here.

09:49.909 --> 09:52.610
Kate's, uh, picture on the
front page and the video blog

09:52.645 --> 09:53.978
attracts a lot of eyeballs.

09:54.013 --> 09:55.579
Yeah.
And here I thought newspapers

09:55.615 --> 09:58.282
were all about telling
the story.

09:58.317 --> 10:01.318
Not anymore.

10:06.392 --> 10:07.491
Excuse me.
I'm Ryan Gill,

10:07.526 --> 10:09.526
National Security Agency.

10:09.562 --> 10:11.662
What can I do for you, Mr. Gill?

10:11.697 --> 10:13.564
I'm here to supervise the
Vivian Prince investigation.

10:13.599 --> 10:16.100
From here forward, everything
you find is gonna have

10:16.135 --> 10:17.434
to pass through me.

10:17.470 --> 10:19.603
Good-bye, Mr. Gill.

10:19.639 --> 10:22.206
Dr. Saroyan, you must realize

10:22.241 --> 10:24.508
there are
national security implications.

10:24.543 --> 10:26.543
I do realize that.
And, personally, I think

10:26.579 --> 10:29.079
what The American did
was nothing short of treason.

10:29.115 --> 10:31.916
He put men and women serving
their country in jeopardy.

10:31.951 --> 10:33.417
I'm glad
that we're on the same page.

10:33.452 --> 10:35.719
However,<i> you</i> must realize

10:35.755 --> 10:38.055
that I'm reluctant
to turn over anything

10:38.090 --> 10:41.125
to an agency that has as much
motive to kill Vivian Prince

10:41.160 --> 10:43.327
as they do
to protect national security.

10:43.362 --> 10:44.602
I'm afraid that's unacceptable.

10:44.630 --> 10:46.397
And I'm afraid
I don't work for you,

10:46.432 --> 10:48.399
I don't answer to you, and...

10:48.434 --> 10:50.634
until I see a court order saying

10:50.670 --> 10:52.469
I have to share
information with you,

10:52.505 --> 10:55.472
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave the building.

10:56.909 --> 10:59.543
Or I could call security.

11:04.483 --> 11:06.383
<i>I'm not saying</i>

11:06.419 --> 11:08.719
what Greystream Solutions
does is right.

11:08.754 --> 11:09.853
But you're saying you dislike

11:09.889 --> 11:11.388
what Vivian did
as much as they do.

11:11.424 --> 11:13.457
Okay. And-and you're okay
with what she did?

11:13.492 --> 11:16.493
I take the long view.
The historical view.

11:16.529 --> 11:20.731
George Washington, in his day,
was considered a traitor.

11:20.766 --> 11:23.634
Oh. Okay. Well, now you're
just trying to piss me off.

11:23.669 --> 11:26.470
Washington was a British subject
who led an army

11:26.505 --> 11:27.705
against his own country.

11:27.740 --> 11:28.872
It's not the same thing.

11:28.908 --> 11:30.107
How do we know?

11:30.142 --> 11:31.742
Sitting here today,
how do we know

11:31.777 --> 11:34.011
if history will look
at Vivian Prince

11:34.046 --> 11:36.880
as a patriot agitating
for change

11:36.916 --> 11:39.016
or a traitor to her country?

11:39.051 --> 11:40.651
You know what,
I'm sorry, Bones,

11:40.686 --> 11:42.386
but it doesn't take me
200 years for me to know

11:42.421 --> 11:43.921
that she was wrong.

11:43.956 --> 11:47.091
I'll catch her killer, but
Vivian Prince was wrong.

11:52.498 --> 11:54.131
There's very little
that I can disclose

11:54.166 --> 11:55.699
that isn't above
your clearance level.

11:55.735 --> 11:57.034
I'm here purely as a courtesy.

11:57.069 --> 11:58.569
Did you kill
Vivian Prince?

11:58.604 --> 12:00.204
Bones, not exactly
where I was gonna start.

12:00.239 --> 12:01.839
Well, if he's
being difficult,

12:01.874 --> 12:03.040
we might as well cut
to the chase.

12:03.075 --> 12:04.375
I like her style.

12:04.410 --> 12:06.377
And that one
I'm happy to answer.

12:06.412 --> 12:09.213
No, Dr. Brennan,
I did not kill her.

12:09.248 --> 12:10.681
Did you have her killed?

12:10.716 --> 12:12.116
No, but I can't say

12:12.151 --> 12:13.550
that I'm unhappy about it.

12:13.586 --> 12:15.219
Okay, so then you
admit to motive.

12:15.254 --> 12:17.187
Anyone who read
her articles knows

12:17.223 --> 12:19.289
that she decimated
my organization,

12:19.325 --> 12:21.258
put lives on the line.

12:21.293 --> 12:22.626
The FBI should be going after

12:22.661 --> 12:25.429
The American for treason,
not coming after us.

12:25.464 --> 12:26.730
You're a suspect

12:26.766 --> 12:28.465
because the forensics suggest

12:28.501 --> 12:30.734
a professional killer
such as yourself.

12:30.770 --> 12:32.803
Well, I can neither
confirm nor deny

12:32.838 --> 12:35.239
any of the allegations
Miss Prince published.

12:35.274 --> 12:37.374
Let's speak in hypotheticals.

12:37.410 --> 12:39.710
If my organization were
the skilled hit squad

12:39.745 --> 12:42.746
she made us out to be,
we wouldn't be here.

12:42.782 --> 12:44.415
Why is that?

12:44.450 --> 12:49.053
Because if we killed her,
you never would have found her.

12:50.956 --> 12:54.124
Besides, the evidence that
you would view as professional,

12:54.160 --> 12:56.093
I would say was amateurish.

12:56.128 --> 12:58.228
And how would you know
what kind of evidence we have?

12:58.264 --> 12:59.963
Didn't you read the articles?

12:59.999 --> 13:01.932
NSA listens in on everything.

13:01.967 --> 13:03.801
So, there you go.
You're saying that the NSA

13:03.836 --> 13:04.968
is tapping our conversations?

13:05.004 --> 13:06.837
I'm not saying anything at all.

13:06.872 --> 13:09.039
We're not done here.
Agent Booth,

13:09.075 --> 13:12.076
all you have is a motive
and a theory.

13:12.111 --> 13:14.812
And if we're listening in
on everything that you're doing,

13:14.847 --> 13:16.680
then we'd know
what evidence you have.

13:16.715 --> 13:18.849
And you don't have jack.

13:23.322 --> 13:25.923
So... if you'll excuse me.

13:33.846 --> 13:36.976
From the point of impact where
it fractured the orbital socket

13:37.076 --> 13:39.743
and damaged the frontal lobe,
this is the shape of the weapon

13:39.778 --> 13:41.678
that killed her.
What do you think?

13:41.714 --> 13:43.347
Maybe a fireplace poker?

13:43.382 --> 13:46.016
Given the sterling silver,
I was thinking candlestick.

13:46.051 --> 13:48.752
Huh. Could be.
Well, in any event,

13:48.787 --> 13:50.120
I'm no longer convinced

13:50.156 --> 13:51.889
that Vivian was killed
by a professional.

13:51.924 --> 13:53.790
In addition to the
blow that killed her,

13:53.826 --> 13:57.861
there are perimortem blows
to the skull here and here.

13:57.897 --> 13:59.663
So it wasn't one killing blow.

13:59.698 --> 14:01.798
There was a struggle.
Well, maybe.

14:01.834 --> 14:04.434
There are no defensive
wounds on her arm or hands.

14:04.470 --> 14:06.803
I found a cracked rib,
but remodeling indicates

14:06.839 --> 14:08.539
that it was fractured
six months ago.

14:08.574 --> 14:12.209
When the first of the articles
attacking the NSA came out.

14:12.244 --> 14:13.710
Ah, good, you're here.

14:13.746 --> 14:15.245
I'm gonna need
reimbursement for this.

14:15.281 --> 14:17.047
Okay. $8,000?!

14:17.082 --> 14:18.515
Well, yeah.

14:18.551 --> 14:20.484
I needed to test a watch
identical to Vivian's.

14:20.519 --> 14:22.152
Lucky it wasn't a Rolex.

14:22.188 --> 14:24.855
I know, right?
We got off cheap.

14:24.890 --> 14:29.860
The good news is, now we have
the exact time of the body dump.

14:30.996 --> 14:32.863
Which is only four hours
more precise

14:32.898 --> 14:34.598
than your original estimate.

14:34.633 --> 14:37.067
Hey, when we drag
a suspect in here,

14:37.102 --> 14:38.402
you're gonna be thanking me.

14:38.437 --> 14:40.370
Fine. Who knows?

14:40.406 --> 14:41.972
Maybe I can bill the NSA

14:42.007 --> 14:44.508
since they tried to take over
our investigation.

14:44.543 --> 14:46.843
Uh...<i> ¿cómo?</i>

14:47.947 --> 14:49.713
Wait. The NSA--
they were here?

14:49.748 --> 14:51.915
Yeah, don't worry.
I sent the guy packing.

14:51.951 --> 14:54.218
I'm sure he'll be back.
No, I don't think so.

14:54.253 --> 14:55.686
The NSA knows
they have no jurisdiction.

14:55.721 --> 14:57.888
No, if there was a power grab,
it was all for show.

14:57.923 --> 14:59.389
He probably showed up here

14:59.425 --> 15:01.425
so he could put a bunch of bugs
so they can listen in.

15:01.460 --> 15:02.993
Okay, let's not
get carried away.

15:03.028 --> 15:05.829
Hey, I hate to say it,
but Dr. Hodgins is right.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.531
All these agencies
work the same,

15:07.566 --> 15:10.467
if it's Washington
or Havana.

15:10.502 --> 15:12.236
You really think
they killed Vivian?

15:12.271 --> 15:13.604
I don't know,

15:13.639 --> 15:16.039
but they sure as hell
want to find The American.

15:16.075 --> 15:19.710
And if our investigation
leads them there, he's dead.

15:23.949 --> 15:26.083
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna call Booth.

15:26.118 --> 15:27.951
I'll have the place swept.

15:27.987 --> 15:29.253
No. Give me your phones.

15:29.288 --> 15:31.321
Big Brother
is watching here, okay?

15:31.357 --> 15:33.824
Or, more accurately, listening.

15:36.161 --> 15:38.161
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

15:38.197 --> 15:40.030
Whatever we find
from here on out,

15:40.065 --> 15:41.865
don't text, don't call,
don't e-mail.

15:41.900 --> 15:46.169
You write it down, or...
we whisper.

15:51.377 --> 15:53.243
<i>I suppose, given what</i>

15:53.279 --> 15:55.712
Cooper Blackthorn said,
Dr. Hodgins is correct.

15:55.748 --> 15:57.247
They are listening.

15:57.283 --> 15:59.283
Which means that we shouldn't
talk about the case.

16:00.653 --> 16:03.020
So, maybe we should
talk about this morning.

16:04.189 --> 16:06.189
This morning?
Yeah, this morning.

16:06.225 --> 16:08.225
The-the phone call.
You hung up

16:08.260 --> 16:10.861
so fast when I got in the kitchen?
You're imagining things, Booth.

16:10.896 --> 16:12.863
No. You know what
I'm imagining?

16:12.898 --> 16:14.665
You know what I'm imagining?

16:14.700 --> 16:17.367
It's five weeks
till Christmas, right?

16:17.403 --> 16:19.336
And you're shopping
early, and you know

16:19.371 --> 16:21.872
that I've had my eye
on that Jet Ski, hmm?

16:21.907 --> 16:24.808
I am not Christmas shopping,
and if I were, I assure you

16:24.843 --> 16:28.145
I would not be buying you a Jet
Ski so you could kill yourself

16:28.180 --> 16:29.746
riding around
like a 16-year-old.

16:29.782 --> 16:31.226
Well, it would make your
husband very happy.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.179
Like a kid on Christmas morning.

16:33.203 --> 16:33.918
No.

16:33.919 --> 16:36.853
Hank and Christine will be
like kids on Christmas morning.

16:36.889 --> 16:38.555
You will be
like a grown-up.

16:38.590 --> 16:40.691
Or... as grown-up
as you can be.

16:40.726 --> 16:43.060
It's Christmas morning.
Everybody acts like a kid.

16:43.095 --> 16:44.013
No. Kids act like kids.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.496
I'm gonna have the
feetie pajamas on,

16:45.497 --> 16:46.630
and I'll be looking
for the Jet Ski.

16:46.654 --> 16:47.365
Great.

16:47.366 --> 16:48.732
Jet Ski under the tree.

16:48.767 --> 16:50.567
Good luck trying to get that
in without making noise.

16:50.602 --> 16:52.336
There has to be
one adult in the family

16:52.371 --> 16:54.371
at least.
Ain't gonna be me.

16:54.406 --> 16:56.973
<i>Not on Christmas morning.</i>

16:59.611 --> 17:01.545
Been three weeks
since Vivian died.

17:01.580 --> 17:03.180
Somebody's been out here.

17:03.215 --> 17:04.614
There's tracks in the dust.

17:04.650 --> 17:08.085
Also, this succulent
is still alive.

17:08.119 --> 17:09.453
It doesn't require much water,

17:09.488 --> 17:11.387
but it does require light.
Hmm.

17:11.423 --> 17:13.190
These shades must have been open

17:13.224 --> 17:15.659
until someone closed them recently.
NSA probably.

17:15.694 --> 17:18.028
I'll get a full team out here,
see if we can nail 'em.

17:18.063 --> 17:20.696
If it was them, it might be
difficult to find evidence,

17:20.733 --> 17:22.465
considering
their professionalism.

17:22.501 --> 17:24.768
Well, Bones, it didn't take us
long to figure out that

17:24.803 --> 17:26.236
somebody else was here,
so either Blackthorn

17:26.271 --> 17:29.139
overestimated his guys,
or it was somebody else.

17:29.174 --> 17:31.875
This is odd.
Vivian has a glucometer.

17:31.910 --> 17:34.111
I don't recall
anything in the file

17:34.146 --> 17:36.513
that said that she was diabetic.

17:38.784 --> 17:41.551
Well, we got a bigger problem--
there's no laptop here.

17:41.587 --> 17:44.321
Wasn't at work, and
it wasn't on the body.

17:44.356 --> 17:45.689
You think the NSA has it?

17:45.724 --> 17:47.858
Maybe this isn't
about the NSA at all.

17:47.893 --> 17:52.329
Vivian Prince was amending
her alimony payments.

17:52.364 --> 17:54.431
What? To pay
her ex-husband less?

17:54.466 --> 17:56.867
She was cutting him off
entirely.

18:00.372 --> 18:02.706
<i>No, we were amicable.</i>

18:02.741 --> 18:06.476
I-I thought
that we could be friends again.

18:06.512 --> 18:08.645
Even though
she was cutting you off?

18:08.680 --> 18:11.748
Actually, that was my idea.

18:11.784 --> 18:13.583
In my experience,
most people don't ask

18:13.619 --> 18:15.719
for less money in a divorce.

18:15.754 --> 18:19.756
The divorce made me see that
I didn't like who I'd become.

18:19.792 --> 18:21.858
I didn't want
to live off Vivian anymore.

18:21.894 --> 18:23.627
I wanted to...
to make it on my own.

18:23.662 --> 18:25.262
I can see that making sense.

18:25.297 --> 18:27.330
But you know
what makes more sense?

18:27.366 --> 18:28.999
That you broke into her house,

18:29.034 --> 18:31.201
where we found your prints,
by the way.

18:31.236 --> 18:33.804
And when she wouldn't change
her mind about the alimony,

18:33.839 --> 18:35.205
you got angry.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.240
That is crazy.

18:37.276 --> 18:40.243
I loved Vivian.
I-I could never...

18:40.279 --> 18:43.447
Dump her body in the pond of the
13th hole at Washington Hills?

18:43.482 --> 18:45.715
The course where you
covered the D.C. sectional

18:45.751 --> 18:48.452
high school golf championships
last spring?

18:48.487 --> 18:51.455
Listen to me. I...
I promise you,

18:51.490 --> 18:54.624
I did not want Vivian dead.

18:56.762 --> 18:59.029
But if-if you want
to find someone who did,

18:59.064 --> 19:00.664
I know exactly where to look.

19:00.699 --> 19:02.332
You want us to go after the NSA?

19:02.367 --> 19:05.769
Killing Vivian only
makes them look worse.

19:05.804 --> 19:07.938
No, the-the person
with the most to gain

19:07.973 --> 19:11.041
from Vivian being gone
is Kate Kolfax.

19:11.076 --> 19:13.210
Vivian promised her the column,

19:13.245 --> 19:16.413
but after The American stories,
Vivian wasn't going anywhere.

19:16.448 --> 19:18.215
The only way for Kate

19:18.250 --> 19:21.718
to get that front page
was to get rid of Vivian.

19:27.826 --> 19:28.925
Agent Aubrey.

19:28.961 --> 19:30.861
Ryan Gill, NSA.
Oh.

19:30.896 --> 19:33.296
Here to tap our phones,
steal a few files?

19:33.332 --> 19:35.298
I know you don't want
to believe this,

19:35.334 --> 19:38.401
but there are people in the NSA
who want us to be better.

19:38.437 --> 19:40.136
Who know things need to change.

19:40.172 --> 19:41.972
If someone on our side
of the fence

19:42.007 --> 19:43.640
killed Vivian Prince,
we want them found.

19:43.675 --> 19:46.142
That was a good speech.
You rehearse that?

19:46.178 --> 19:48.745
Okay, look, you don't want
my help, I get it.

19:48.780 --> 19:50.914
But you're about
to question Kate Kolfax.

19:50.949 --> 19:54.784
Look at that. This man knows
where I'm going before I do.

19:54.820 --> 19:56.920
Let me just offer you
one piece of advice.

19:56.955 --> 19:58.622
Ask her about
the encryption key.

19:58.657 --> 20:01.458
I'll bite. What the hell
is the encryption key?

20:01.493 --> 20:03.493
Just the thing that
Kate Kolfax has been using

20:03.529 --> 20:06.596
for the last three hours
to try to decode the e-mails

20:06.632 --> 20:09.165
between Vivian Prince
and The American.

20:17.101 --> 20:20.460
I am interviewing Special
Agent James Aubrey of the FBI.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.293
On the record.

20:22.447 --> 20:24.816
So, I understand
you've recently learned

20:24.916 --> 20:26.649
exactly when Vivian's
body was dumped

20:26.685 --> 20:28.618
at Washington Hills
Country Club?

20:28.653 --> 20:29.398
That we have.

20:29.468 --> 20:31.428
And it's gonna help you
close in on your suspects?

20:32.390 --> 20:34.224
That it will.

20:34.259 --> 20:36.426
You're so quotable.

20:36.461 --> 20:38.962
I answered the question, right?

20:38.997 --> 20:41.731
Okay, let's try being
a little more specific.

20:41.766 --> 20:43.399
Is Cooper Blackthorn a suspect?

20:43.435 --> 20:45.165
I cannot confirm that
at this time.

20:45.166 --> 20:46.108
Sal Raymond?

20:46.132 --> 20:48.688
No, cannot confirm that
at this time.

20:50.575 --> 20:52.442
You suck at being interviewed.

20:52.477 --> 20:54.510
Went out on a limb
to get you this much.

20:54.546 --> 20:56.879
But, listen, I was thinking--
you and I are both young.

20:56.915 --> 20:58.381
Moving up the ladder.

20:58.416 --> 21:01.384
Maybe I help you, you help me.

21:01.419 --> 21:04.220
Okay. What do you want to know?

21:04.256 --> 21:08.491
I want to know
what Vivian was really like.

21:10.895 --> 21:13.162
Off the record?

21:13.198 --> 21:15.531
When I first started here,
I was in awe.

21:15.567 --> 21:19.035
I thought she could show me the
ropes, I could learn to be her.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.971
But what you learn
working with Vivian

21:22.007 --> 21:24.707
is there's no working
<i>with</i> Vivian.

21:24.743 --> 21:26.075
You sound bitter.

21:26.111 --> 21:28.611
You asked me what she was like.

21:32.117 --> 21:33.850
Now, I helped you,

21:33.885 --> 21:35.952
so you got to give me
something more.

21:35.987 --> 21:39.255
Okay. We know that the killer
broke into Vivian's house.

21:39.291 --> 21:43.126
We ran the place for prints,
and they'll be back any minute.

21:43.161 --> 21:45.628
Really? You have fingerprints?

21:45.664 --> 21:47.230
We also know

21:47.265 --> 21:49.198
that the killer is looking
for The American,

21:49.234 --> 21:51.734
and he or she has
an encryption key

21:51.770 --> 21:53.603
that Vivian had,
and that he

21:53.638 --> 21:55.505
or she is trying to crack it.

21:55.540 --> 21:57.573
And we are going
to arrest him...

21:58.977 --> 22:03.546
...or her... by the end
of the day for murder.

22:03.581 --> 22:06.816
This interview was just
a pretext, wasn't it?

22:06.851 --> 22:09.419
We found your prints
in her house.

22:09.454 --> 22:12.755
Okay. I was in her apartment.

22:12.791 --> 22:14.824
I didn't know
how to do the story right

22:14.859 --> 22:16.092
without The American.

22:16.127 --> 22:17.927
So I broke in,
I saw her laptop...

22:17.962 --> 22:19.162
You stole her laptop.

22:19.197 --> 22:21.397
You know what?

22:22.801 --> 22:25.268
You can have her laptop.
And the encryption key.

22:25.303 --> 22:26.536
It doesn't even work.

22:26.571 --> 22:28.671
So you didn't find The American?

22:28.707 --> 22:30.306
What is "George Orwell"?

22:30.342 --> 22:31.674
Yeah, I thought
that was the passphrase,

22:31.710 --> 22:33.142
but it's not working.

22:33.178 --> 22:34.844
So maybe you guys can crack it.

22:34.879 --> 22:37.013
And if you do, you call me

22:37.048 --> 22:40.350
if you find this guy, you know,
since I'm being so cooperative.

22:44.622 --> 22:47.523
<i>Well, maybe it's not</i>
<i>"George Orwell."</i>

22:47.559 --> 22:49.525
Well, "Orwell" should work,
but the program's asking

22:49.561 --> 22:51.761
for a second code.

22:51.796 --> 22:52.802
What if we used the...

22:52.826 --> 22:55.125
Uh, uh, don't-don't
say it out loud,

22:55.467 --> 22:57.300
Angie, just,
you know, do it.

22:57.335 --> 22:59.135
Honey, we swept for bugs.

22:59.170 --> 23:02.672
Apart from those little critters
in your office, we're clean.

23:02.707 --> 23:05.641
Anything?

23:05.677 --> 23:07.910
No.
Nothing.

23:07.946 --> 23:10.513
What about you?
I found something odd.

23:10.548 --> 23:13.015
Dr. Brennan found this
glucometer at Vivian's house,

23:13.051 --> 23:16.018
so I double-checked,
and Vivian wasn't a diabetic.

23:16.054 --> 23:19.989
So I took a look at this thing,
and it's been modified somehow.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.791
I'm trying to figure out
what it is.

23:22.927 --> 23:25.428
What if this is
a dual access system?

23:25.463 --> 23:27.730
Passphrase plus
biometric encryption.

23:27.766 --> 23:28.917
Oh, that is genius.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.841
You're saying
the messages from The American

23:30.968 --> 23:33.903
could only be decoded when
Vivian typed in a passphrase

23:33.938 --> 23:36.806
and plugged in a
verification code?

23:36.841 --> 23:38.341
Drawn from her blood.
It's reading

23:38.376 --> 23:39.675
her genetic markers.

23:39.711 --> 23:41.310
If it's not Vivian's blood,

23:41.346 --> 23:43.379
you can't crack the code.

23:43.415 --> 23:45.314
One very big problem.

23:45.350 --> 23:47.049
She was in the water
for three weeks.

23:47.085 --> 23:49.152
There's no more viable blood.

23:52.056 --> 23:54.056
<i> I'm pumping</i>
<i>the medullary cavity</i>

23:54.092 --> 23:57.593
with a diluted
hydrogen peroxide solution.

23:57.629 --> 24:01.564
In theory, it could react
with any remaining hemoglobin.

24:01.599 --> 24:03.666
No, it has to, brother.
If there's no blood,

24:03.701 --> 24:05.568
there is no way
to break that code.

24:05.603 --> 24:07.537
It would have been better
if we drew this

24:07.572 --> 24:09.439
before we cleaned the bones,
but I'll try.

24:09.474 --> 24:11.107
Tibia's our best bet.

24:15.580 --> 24:16.879
There's nothing there.

24:16.915 --> 24:18.548
Wait, wait, wait.

24:20.051 --> 24:21.384
Yes.

24:21.419 --> 24:22.718
Hello, code breaker.

24:25.723 --> 24:27.490
Here goes nothing.

24:27.525 --> 24:30.126
Come on, baby.
Do your magic.

24:32.597 --> 24:37.033
Okay, I'm calling up
the last e-mail.

24:38.703 --> 24:40.403
Yeah, this is it, this is it.

24:40.438 --> 24:42.672
The last e-mail from
The American to Vivian Prince.

24:42.707 --> 24:45.308
Okay, uh...
"We need to meet. Tonight.

24:45.343 --> 24:47.410
"The Riverbanks Inn, room 43.

24:47.445 --> 24:49.412
Make sure you aren't followed."

24:49.447 --> 24:52.315
The meeting happened the
same night her body was dumped.

24:55.086 --> 24:56.686
<i>I understand you need</i>

24:56.721 --> 24:58.521
- access to room 43.
- Yeah, we need

24:58.556 --> 25:01.123
all the receipts and the records
and charges to that room.

25:01.159 --> 25:02.525
I'm afraid that's not possible.

25:02.560 --> 25:03.559
You're gonna make
us get a warrant?

25:03.595 --> 25:04.994
I'm not being
difficult.

25:05.029 --> 25:07.263
I just can't give you
what I don't have.

25:07.298 --> 25:08.798
Our hotel is very particular.

25:08.833 --> 25:11.067
We cater to Washington insiders
who are trying

25:11.102 --> 25:13.002
to conduct their affairs
off the grid.

25:13.037 --> 25:15.204
What about security footage?
No.

25:15.240 --> 25:17.773
We don't even have records.
Cash only. Pay first.

25:17.809 --> 25:19.442
No TV, no phone, no Wi-Fi.

25:19.477 --> 25:21.911
I have jamming devices
throughout the entire property.

25:21.946 --> 25:23.446
But we can get into the room?

25:23.481 --> 25:25.214
Like I told your associate
ten minutes ago,

25:25.250 --> 25:27.950
I'm all for letting you people
do your job. Have at it.

25:30.722 --> 25:32.555
Associate?

25:32.590 --> 25:34.690
Freeze.

25:34.726 --> 25:36.177
Hey. That isn't necessary.
I'm...

25:36.178 --> 25:36.838
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:36.862 --> 25:38.253
We know who you are, okay?
Just step out of the room.

25:38.353 --> 25:41.197
Don't touch anything either, okay?
This could be a crime scene.

25:41.232 --> 25:42.665
It was a crime scene weeks ago.

25:42.700 --> 25:44.233
How many people
have been here since?

25:44.269 --> 25:47.303
Like I told Agent Aubrey,
I just want to help.

25:47.338 --> 25:49.939
And you're welcome for the tip
about the encryption key.

25:51.476 --> 25:52.875
Ooh.

25:52.911 --> 25:54.277
What is it, Bones?

25:54.312 --> 25:55.912
You got some blood there?
No.

25:55.947 --> 25:58.214
Let's just say,
given the romantic setting,

25:58.249 --> 26:00.182
the hotel should spend more
on housekeeping.

26:00.218 --> 26:01.884
Ooh.
Look, there's no reason for us

26:01.920 --> 26:03.920
to be at odds. We both have a
job to do. You guys have

26:03.955 --> 26:06.355
a murder case, and I have treason.
That's great. Well, at least

26:06.391 --> 26:08.291
I'm not spying on your work
to do my job.

26:08.326 --> 26:11.127
Oh, Booth.

26:11.162 --> 26:12.128
Is that...

26:12.163 --> 26:14.096
Blood spatter.

26:14.132 --> 26:15.765
So she was killed here?

26:15.800 --> 26:17.199
We'll do a full workup,

26:17.235 --> 26:19.235
see if it was just
her blood or...

26:21.839 --> 26:23.472
Sir!

26:23.508 --> 26:24.440
Stop! FBI!

26:24.475 --> 26:27.743
Uh, partner of the FBI.

26:27.779 --> 26:30.379
I found the murder weapon.
Sterling silver.

26:30.415 --> 26:32.114
This is the exact shape.
Okay,

26:32.150 --> 26:33.683
look, FBI,
we're gonna have to keep this.

26:33.718 --> 26:35.952
And any other lids
that you might have

26:35.987 --> 26:37.219
that match it.

26:37.255 --> 26:38.721
Look, you recognize this woman?

26:38.756 --> 26:40.156
She checked into that room
about three weeks ago.

26:40.191 --> 26:41.691
I already asked
him. They're trained

26:41.726 --> 26:42.825
to leave the carts
at the door.

26:42.860 --> 26:43.860
Yeah, yeah,
we know.

26:43.895 --> 26:45.661
Hear no evil,
see no evil.

26:45.697 --> 26:47.763
Come on, you're human.
You see people come and go.

26:47.799 --> 26:50.032
You recognize her?

26:51.402 --> 26:53.002
Actually, I do recognize her.

26:53.037 --> 26:54.737
But not-not
from three weeks ago.

26:54.772 --> 26:56.405
Maybe six months ago?

26:56.441 --> 26:57.540
She rented
that room.

26:57.575 --> 26:58.575
Her husband showed up.

26:58.610 --> 27:00.276
Her husband?

27:00.311 --> 27:01.277
He caught her

27:01.312 --> 27:03.045
here with another man.

27:03.081 --> 27:05.848
You know, if we hadn't dragged
him out of there...

27:05.883 --> 27:07.883
Her husband was ready
to kill her.

27:13.193 --> 27:16.094
<i>The word that you used</i>
<i>was "amicable."</i>

27:16.129 --> 27:18.363
And as you're a writer,
I made the mistake of thinking

27:18.398 --> 27:20.498
that you actually knew
what the hell you were saying.

27:20.534 --> 27:23.134
Look, Vivian and I were
getting along fine, I swear it.

27:23.170 --> 27:25.303
Except for the part where
you followed her, caught her

27:25.338 --> 27:27.972
with another man,
and were ready to kill her.

27:28.008 --> 27:30.808
I didn't do it!

27:30.844 --> 27:34.312
I talked to her lawyer,
Sal, okay? I know about the rib

27:34.347 --> 27:35.847
she broke when
you shoved her

27:35.882 --> 27:37.515
into a table.

27:37.551 --> 27:39.350
I was humiliated.

27:39.386 --> 27:42.353
She admitted to the affair.
We had it out.

27:42.389 --> 27:45.056
I-I swear to you,
we were on good terms.

27:47.093 --> 27:50.028
Look, maybe it was the guy.

27:50.063 --> 27:51.863
The guy she was sleeping with.

27:51.898 --> 27:53.665
Okay.

27:53.700 --> 27:55.433
You know who he is?

27:55.468 --> 27:57.268
No. But he...

27:57.304 --> 28:00.171
he had nice shoes.
Uh, Ferragamos, I think.

28:00.207 --> 28:01.606
Wow. That is helpful.

28:01.641 --> 28:03.675
Vivian saw me
and slammed the door shut.

28:03.710 --> 28:06.010
All I saw were his shoes.

28:06.046 --> 28:08.746
He was too chicken to come out
and face me man-to-man.

28:08.782 --> 28:10.882
Maybe he figured
you might kill him.

28:10.917 --> 28:13.218
You know what I
think happened, Sal?

28:13.253 --> 28:15.486
I think you never got over it.

28:15.522 --> 28:17.522
Then it was a Friday night,
you had

28:17.557 --> 28:19.190
a few too many,
you missed her,

28:19.226 --> 28:21.726
and you tracked her back
to the hotel.

28:21.761 --> 28:24.229
Wait a minute, Friday night?

28:24.264 --> 28:27.332
No, I wasn't even here in D.C.
I was in Tallahassee.

28:27.367 --> 28:29.667
No, I talked to the paper
that you work for, okay?

28:29.703 --> 28:32.337
You were not covering a game
that night. You called in sick.

28:32.372 --> 28:37.075
I lied to them, because I had
an interview at another paper.

28:37.110 --> 28:39.410
If I was gonna make it
on my own,

28:39.446 --> 28:41.879
I couldn't afford
to stay in D.C.

28:43.950 --> 28:47.018
Ch-Check it out.
I was... I wasn't here.

28:49.000 --> 28:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

28:57.430 --> 28:59.397
Damn it.

28:59.432 --> 29:01.633
How is a guy who works
for an intelligence agency

29:01.668 --> 29:03.134
so stupid?

29:03.169 --> 29:05.470
This is the third set of prints
from Ryan Gill.

29:05.505 --> 29:07.538
He comes in here like an
elephant in a china shop.

29:07.574 --> 29:08.974
And there are no prints
from her ex?

29:09.009 --> 29:11.409
The ex might not be our guy.

29:11.444 --> 29:12.977
Now you tell us?
Turns out

29:13.013 --> 29:14.078
that the ex has an alibi.

29:14.114 --> 29:15.747
But he gave us
something

29:15.782 --> 29:17.582
about the guy
that Vivian was sleeping with.

29:17.617 --> 29:18.816
Which is?

29:18.852 --> 29:20.952
Ferragamo shoes.

29:20.987 --> 29:23.621
That's it?
He saw the guy's shoes?

29:23.657 --> 29:25.904
Don't shoot the messenger.
So how's everything coming here?

29:25.928 --> 29:26.925
Well,

29:26.926 --> 29:29.627
we got too much and too little.
Trace from all the hotel guests

29:29.663 --> 29:31.129
and our NSA shadow,

29:31.164 --> 29:33.064
but most of the blood
has been cleaned up.

29:33.099 --> 29:36.067
Yeah. With Haemo-Sol.
It's very high-end stuff.

29:36.102 --> 29:38.569
Our killer definitely knew
how to minimize trace.

29:38.605 --> 29:40.405
So we're back
to Blackthorn's people?

29:40.440 --> 29:43.508
Hey, man, truth be told,
I never left them.

29:43.543 --> 29:45.076
Are you kidding me?

29:45.111 --> 29:46.878
This Ryan Gill
really pisses me off.

29:46.913 --> 29:48.313
He touched
everything.

29:48.348 --> 29:50.915
I mean, how stupid can...

29:50.950 --> 29:53.618
Maybe he's not stupid at all.

29:55.055 --> 29:56.454
What? Do you think he

29:56.489 --> 29:58.056
contaminated the scene
on purpose?

29:58.091 --> 30:01.326
To cover up the fact
that he'd been here before.

30:01.361 --> 30:02.760
So Gill is the killer.

30:02.796 --> 30:04.329
Or he's the guy
Vivian was sleeping with.

30:04.364 --> 30:05.296
He did have nice shoes.

30:05.332 --> 30:06.964
Oh, my God.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.934
There's a third option.

30:18.345 --> 30:20.511
<i>This NSA slime is The American?</i>

30:20.547 --> 30:22.480
Vivian couldn't tell her husband
who she was meeting.

30:22.515 --> 30:25.116
She admitted to the affair
to throw him off.

30:25.151 --> 30:27.952
She ruined her marriage
to protect her source?

30:27.987 --> 30:29.987
You know what, the marriage
was on its last legs anyways.

30:30.023 --> 30:32.290
I'll bring in Gill.
Uh, no.

30:32.325 --> 30:34.325
No, you can't.
But we have to.

30:34.361 --> 30:37.562
He is very likely the last
person to see Vivian alive.

30:37.597 --> 30:39.364
If you bring Gill in,
whoever killed Vivian

30:39.399 --> 30:40.965
is gonna know who
The American is.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
You might as well pull
the trigger yourself.

30:43.036 --> 30:45.269
Well, maybe he should've thought of
that before he committed treason.

30:45.305 --> 30:47.271
Booth, there's got to be some
way you can meet

30:47.294 --> 30:48.840
with this guy
and talk to him in secret.

30:48.842 --> 30:51.676
This guy put dozens of agents'
lives in jeopardy, and, what,

30:51.711 --> 30:53.444
you want me to give him
some kind of special treatment?

30:53.480 --> 30:54.612
He was trying
to do the right thing.

30:54.647 --> 30:56.447
Stop right there, okay?

30:56.483 --> 30:58.883
You never served. You don't get
the right to defend this guy.

30:58.918 --> 31:01.018
I'm just saying, Booth...
What you're saying is that it's okay

31:01.054 --> 31:02.720
for this guy to put other people
in danger.

31:02.756 --> 31:04.355
You know what? It's not.

31:04.391 --> 31:06.257
Booth, I think you should hear him out.
Oh,

31:06.292 --> 31:08.092
of course
you're on his side, huh?

31:08.128 --> 31:10.428
But then again, you've been
all about secrets this week.

31:10.463 --> 31:12.597
Some secrets are good secrets.

31:12.632 --> 31:15.166
Sorry, Bones. I just disagree with you.
Hey, Dad.

31:16.970 --> 31:18.669
Parker.

31:20.673 --> 31:23.374
Hey. What's up?

31:24.811 --> 31:28.413
That is the secret
I've been keeping. Surprise.

31:28.448 --> 31:30.181
Hey, Parker.

31:30.216 --> 31:31.716
You fly in for Thanksgiving?

31:31.751 --> 31:33.084
Yeah, Thanksgiving
dinner.

31:33.119 --> 31:34.819
To see my new little brother.
Also,

31:34.854 --> 31:36.988
the two of you have seats
behind the glass

31:37.023 --> 31:39.290
for the Flyers/Predators game
on Friday night.

31:39.325 --> 31:40.470
Seriously?

31:40.493 --> 31:42.587
That's what I was on the phone
about this morning.

31:42.896 --> 31:45.296
Okay, some secrets I like.

31:45.331 --> 31:47.031
Look at you.
You are getting big.

31:47.066 --> 31:49.167
Yeah. Must be all
the fish and chips in London.

31:49.202 --> 31:50.802
Right. Thanks, Bones.

31:50.837 --> 31:52.970
Look, I really
appreciate this.

31:55.008 --> 31:56.908
Look at you.
You look great. Huh?

31:56.943 --> 31:59.210
All right. Look at you.

31:59.245 --> 32:00.812
I noticed tiny
avulsion fractures

32:00.847 --> 32:02.947
at some of the muscle
attachment sites.

32:02.982 --> 32:04.949
Not from six months ago--
these were perimortem.

32:04.984 --> 32:06.751
They were probably obscured
by the brushite

32:06.786 --> 32:07.985
that formed in the water.

32:08.021 --> 32:09.587
I believe they were caused

32:09.622 --> 32:12.924
by restraints
placed here and here.

32:12.959 --> 32:14.425
She was tied down?

32:14.461 --> 32:15.660
And tortured for information.

32:15.695 --> 32:17.328
Take a look at the fractures

32:17.363 --> 32:19.263
to the right
proximal tibia.

32:19.299 --> 32:21.699
So you think she was
tortured on her shins?

32:21.734 --> 32:23.801
That's not like any
torture I know of.

32:23.837 --> 32:26.571
It's called <i> palmatória,</i>
an excruciating practice

32:26.606 --> 32:29.340
indigenous to the West African
region of Guinea-Bissau.

32:29.375 --> 32:32.009
That makes sense.
Cooper Blackthorn,

32:32.045 --> 32:34.078
the head
of Greystream Solutions,

32:34.113 --> 32:37.515
he was stationed in West Africa
for five years.

32:48.895 --> 32:51.028
Why are we meeting here?

32:51.064 --> 32:53.631
Because we're completely off the
grid. There's no Wi-Fi signal.

32:53.666 --> 32:55.233
Everything's jammed.

32:55.268 --> 32:57.735
No one's gonna hear a word
that we say.

32:57.770 --> 32:59.170
And why is that important?

32:59.205 --> 33:02.139
Because I know
that you're The American.

33:05.111 --> 33:06.911
We're gonna have a little chat.

33:06.946 --> 33:08.446
Either we're gonna do it here,

33:08.481 --> 33:10.781
or we're gonna do it
down at the FBI.

33:10.817 --> 33:12.416
That's your choice.

33:15.021 --> 33:16.988
Easy.

33:17.023 --> 33:19.190
I want you to find
Vivian's killer,

33:19.225 --> 33:21.526
so I'll talk, but not
if we're being recorded.

33:21.561 --> 33:23.194
We're not being recorded.

33:23.229 --> 33:26.197
Tell you what--
you can put that down.

33:30.937 --> 33:34.071
You violated three sections
of the Espionage Act.

33:34.107 --> 33:35.940
No one's gonna want
to try me for that.

33:35.975 --> 33:37.842
They'd have to enter
into evidence what I stole.

33:37.877 --> 33:39.477
Then the case would end up
being about

33:39.512 --> 33:41.345
what it should be about--
what the NSA did wrong.

33:41.381 --> 33:43.381
So you're not taking any
responsibility for what you did?

33:43.416 --> 33:45.249
I know the cost of what I did.

33:45.285 --> 33:47.184
It's right here in this room.

33:49.055 --> 33:50.788
But I don't think it means

33:50.823 --> 33:53.157
that I should be
executed for it.

33:53.192 --> 33:56.527
What happened that night?
Why were you here?

33:56.563 --> 33:58.095
The jump drive

33:58.131 --> 34:01.332
that I gave Vivian has thousands
of NSA documents on it.

34:01.367 --> 34:02.934
She was working her way
through them.

34:02.969 --> 34:04.835
We were deciding
what to do next.

34:04.871 --> 34:06.370
And what was that?

34:06.406 --> 34:07.872
What she printed

34:07.907 --> 34:09.639
about Greystream Solutions
was just the beginning.

34:09.676 --> 34:11.976
She was going to continue
hammering them.

34:12.011 --> 34:14.277
They must have tracked her here
after I left.

34:14.313 --> 34:15.713
All right, so you're saying

34:15.748 --> 34:17.348
that Cooper Blackthorn
is the one who did this?

34:17.382 --> 34:18.849
I know that he did.

34:18.885 --> 34:20.618
Your people found evidence
that he tortured her.

34:20.652 --> 34:22.018
Ten minutes ago.

34:22.054 --> 34:24.522
That changes everything.

34:24.556 --> 34:26.223
Changes things how?

34:26.259 --> 34:27.792
Well, if we have
Vivian's killer,

34:27.827 --> 34:29.527
your life isn't in danger.

34:29.562 --> 34:32.029
You're under arrest for treason.
Turn around.

34:41.351 --> 34:43.851
Bad day for the NSA.

34:43.886 --> 34:47.088
One agent arrested for treason,
another for murder.

34:47.123 --> 34:49.223
My client did not
commit murder.

34:49.259 --> 34:51.779
And he's willing to cooperate
in order to prove it.

34:51.803 --> 34:52.594
Okay.

34:52.594 --> 34:55.730
'Cause I heard he wasn't
so cooperative the other day.

34:55.764 --> 34:58.299
Well, when the NSA
throws me to the wolves,

34:58.334 --> 35:00.468
it makes taking the
fall less attractive.

35:00.503 --> 35:02.603
I was operating
on their orders.

35:02.639 --> 35:04.505
You were told
to murder Vivian Prince?

35:04.540 --> 35:07.541
No. To use enhanced
interrogation techniques

35:07.577 --> 35:10.378
to recover documents
stolen from the NSA.

35:10.413 --> 35:13.381
So something went wrong, maybe
you didn't mean to kill her.

35:13.416 --> 35:14.982
Something did go wrong.

35:15.018 --> 35:16.984
She knew
that if she ended up dead,

35:17.020 --> 35:18.753
Greystream Solutions
would be on the hook.

35:18.788 --> 35:20.955
So she refused
to give up the jump drive.

35:20.990 --> 35:24.025
Ms. Prince-- she was tougher
than we thought.

35:25.495 --> 35:28.296
You just gave up
and walked away?

35:28.331 --> 35:32.400
Look, we've been tracking
every move that you make,

35:32.435 --> 35:35.703
so we know what evidence
you have and what you don't.

35:35.738 --> 35:40.141
You've got me on the torture,
but not the killing.

35:40.176 --> 35:42.476
That's because I left her alive.

35:49.218 --> 35:51.218
Man, I knew it.

35:51.254 --> 35:53.421
They were monitoring
every word we said.

35:53.456 --> 35:56.057
I guess what
they say is true--

35:56.092 --> 35:58.092
even paranoids
have enemies.

35:58.127 --> 36:00.961
I'm afraid this
re-creation is not right.

36:00.997 --> 36:02.730
Uh, no, I think it is.

36:02.765 --> 36:05.800
The-the lid is a perfect match
for the blow that killed her.

36:05.835 --> 36:07.501
Look.

36:09.472 --> 36:11.238
It's a perfect fit

36:11.274 --> 36:13.374
for that blow,
but the other depressions

36:13.409 --> 36:16.644
on the skull do not match
the edges of this lid.

36:16.679 --> 36:19.347
So she was hit
with two weapons?

36:19.382 --> 36:22.083
She was hit with some kind of
long, rectangular weapon,

36:22.118 --> 36:23.818
knocking her face first
into this lid.

36:23.853 --> 36:25.553
So, we don't know

36:25.588 --> 36:28.289
who killed her, and now we
don't know what killed her?

36:28.324 --> 36:29.990
This is great. We're
moving backwards here.

36:30.026 --> 36:32.159
Maybe I can help.

36:32.195 --> 36:35.096
Based on Dr. Brennan's findings,
I reexamined the skull.

36:35.131 --> 36:38.099
Along with the depressions,
there are tiny abrasions.

36:38.134 --> 36:40.201
Now I believe
those abrasions

36:40.236 --> 36:42.970
are from the metal prongs
on a motherboard.

36:43.005 --> 36:45.072
So, someone hit her on the head

36:45.108 --> 36:47.308
with a long,
rectangular computer?

36:47.343 --> 36:49.276
Aha! I got it!

36:51.814 --> 36:54.382
Uh, nope, it's not a bug.

36:54.417 --> 36:57.518
What is it?
It's... nothing.

36:57.553 --> 36:58.719
What is it?

36:58.755 --> 37:00.321
It's the earring

37:00.356 --> 37:03.090
that you lost
when we were, um...

37:03.126 --> 37:05.726
Oh.

37:05.762 --> 37:07.795
Oh, yeah.

37:07.830 --> 37:10.431
Great.

37:10.466 --> 37:11.999
What? You...

37:12.034 --> 37:13.567
You know that we're
married, right?

37:13.603 --> 37:15.002
That's beside the point.

37:15.037 --> 37:17.304
The point is, you found
that earring by using

37:17.340 --> 37:19.807
a metal detector which
is essentially a long,

37:19.842 --> 37:21.075
rectangular computer.

37:21.110 --> 37:24.011
Booth took that
from Ryan Gill, right?

37:24.046 --> 37:25.780
The-The American?

37:25.815 --> 37:30.151
It seems that Mr. Gill
was not only Vivian's source.

37:30.186 --> 37:32.586
He was her killer.

37:34.891 --> 37:37.158
<i>Shape of the metal detector</i>

37:37.193 --> 37:39.326
matches the wounds
on Vivian's head.

37:39.362 --> 37:42.463
And the specific layout
of the metal prongs

37:42.498 --> 37:45.032
on its motherboard
match her wounds exactly.

37:45.067 --> 37:46.400
We got you for treason...

37:46.436 --> 37:48.502
...and murder.

37:50.773 --> 37:55.976
I thought I could trust her...
to figure out where the line was

37:56.012 --> 37:57.845
between what
the public should know

37:57.880 --> 38:00.981
and what would endanger lives,
but she wanted a bigger story.

38:01.017 --> 38:03.083
You didn't want her to expose
Greystream Solutions?

38:03.119 --> 38:04.718
Not the way that she did.

38:04.754 --> 38:06.487
Like you said,
all those employees,

38:06.522 --> 38:08.289
innocent people--
suddenly, they're all targets?

38:08.324 --> 38:09.924
So you killed her?

38:12.195 --> 38:14.595
I just wanted
my jump drive back.

38:14.630 --> 38:17.665
But she had Kate Kolfax
ready to take over her column.

38:17.700 --> 38:20.901
Her editor wanted young and sexy
on the front page.

38:20.937 --> 38:23.571
The documents were just
her leverage to keep her job.

38:23.606 --> 38:25.439
You killed her
for the documents.

38:26.909 --> 38:29.510
I was using the wand
to try to find the jump drive.

38:29.545 --> 38:31.011
She didn't want to give it back.

38:31.047 --> 38:34.048
She grabbed onto the wand,
and I hit her.

38:37.053 --> 38:40.654
Then she fell
into the room service cart.

38:40.690 --> 38:42.389
Where's the jump drive now?

38:42.425 --> 38:44.892
I never found it.

38:47.864 --> 38:50.898
Look, this-this was
an accident, I swear.

38:50.933 --> 38:53.033
Yeah. And then
you carved open her body

38:53.069 --> 38:55.936
and dumped it in a pond in order
to tank our investigation.

38:55.972 --> 38:57.905
You see,
that was not an accident.

38:57.940 --> 39:01.141

less patriotic now, doesn't it?

You found it?
Yeah, I did.

42:20.643 --> 42:22.910
I suppose you're gonna broadcast
everything that's in this

42:22.945 --> 42:25.212

No, I'm gonna give it to you.
