WEBVTT

00:23.588 --> 00:24.676
Well, this is awkward.

00:24.720 --> 00:25.938
Never thought I would die
in a hearse.

00:26.765 --> 00:29.029
I don't plan on
letting that happen.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.030
Watch out!

00:39.213 --> 00:40.214
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

00:52.139 --> 00:53.444
That's not good.

00:56.099 --> 00:58.797
This is why I don't make plans.

01:26.216 --> 01:28.088
My head knows that Hanna
house rules don't apply to me,

01:28.131 --> 01:31.917
but my heart still says
I broke one.

01:31.961 --> 01:33.310
You're late.

01:34.355 --> 01:36.835
Said we were starting at 6:00.
It's 6:00 exactly.

01:39.011 --> 01:40.709
Exactly.

01:42.450 --> 01:46.715
Oh, this is one of
those life lessons.

01:46.758 --> 01:47.890
I get it.

01:47.933 --> 01:49.152
What do you get?

01:49.196 --> 01:50.371
Oh, I get that, you know,
you like to find

01:50.414 --> 01:52.199
moments in life
to impart wisdom.

01:52.242 --> 01:53.374
It's cool.
I respect it.

01:53.417 --> 01:55.158
I don't give lessons.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.986
When I first got here,

01:57.029 --> 01:58.944
you sent me up on a ride-along
with a death doula.

01:58.988 --> 02:01.208
That wasn't a lesson.
That was an opportunity.

02:01.251 --> 02:05.037
You gave me your personal copy
of <i>The Things They Carried.</i>

02:05.081 --> 02:06.822
A suggestion.

02:06.865 --> 02:10.173
I just signed up
for a silent survival retreat

02:11.392 --> 02:13.437
SAMHANNA50.

02:13.481 --> 02:14.699
50% off.

02:14.743 --> 02:16.919
I think you better
get silent soon,

02:16.962 --> 02:18.268
or you may not survive
the workout.

02:18.312 --> 02:19.922
Mm.

02:19.965 --> 02:21.184
That means we're doing
ten miles, doesn't it?

02:21.228 --> 02:22.968
Nine, I'm in a hurry.

02:23.012 --> 02:24.796
Oh. Got a case?
No.

02:24.840 --> 02:25.928
I got to go home and pack.

02:25.971 --> 02:27.103
Me and Callen are flying
to D.C. tonight.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.149
Is Kilbride sending you?

02:29.192 --> 02:30.802
Hampton University is doing
a scholarship

02:30.846 --> 02:31.890
in Michelle's name.

02:31.934 --> 02:34.154
They want me
to give a speech.

02:34.197 --> 02:37.157
Man, that's-that's awesome, Sam.
You must be proud.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.071
Michelle always said Hampton is
who she was.

02:39.115 --> 02:40.160
And it would mean a lot to her.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.074
Oh. Well,

02:42.118 --> 02:44.164
I know you've been out of school
much longer than me,

02:44.207 --> 02:46.427
so...
Hmm.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.342
I'm just saying, you know,

02:48.385 --> 02:50.735
I-I can relate to college kids.

02:50.779 --> 02:53.173
Need help with that speech,
just give me the word.

02:55.392 --> 02:56.654
No. Way.

02:56.698 --> 02:57.786
Hmm?

02:57.829 --> 03:00.049
Grab the water.
Let's go.

03:00.092 --> 03:01.355
Hurry up.

03:01.398 --> 03:02.660
Yep.
Double time.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.140
- Double time.
- Yes, sir.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.576
It was just a suggestion.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.103
Angela?

03:11.147 --> 03:12.540
Angela Pak, right?

03:18.894 --> 03:20.548
Wouldn't do that.

03:20.591 --> 03:22.767
Who are you?

03:22.811 --> 03:25.117
NCIS.
Special Agent Callen.

03:25.161 --> 03:26.684
And that's supposed to
make me feel better?

03:26.728 --> 03:28.469
Look.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.340
I'm just hoping
to ask you a few questions.

03:30.384 --> 03:33.213
Sorry, Columbo,
I'm already late for work.

03:35.258 --> 03:38.522
It's about your ex-girlfriend,
Kate Miller.

03:42.787 --> 03:44.224
<i>All I'm saying is,</i>

03:44.267 --> 03:45.703
I know that marriage is tough,

03:45.747 --> 03:47.270
but I also know some things are
worth fighting for.

03:47.314 --> 03:48.532
Sweetheart, you're
being so ridiculous.

03:48.576 --> 03:49.925
I'm not being ridiculous.
I'm being honest.

03:49.968 --> 03:52.232
- I just want you to hear me out.
- I've heard enough.

03:52.275 --> 03:54.669
Two people in love, like,
shouldn't that be enough

03:54.712 --> 03:57.411
to overcome all those external
circumstances, right?

03:57.454 --> 03:59.369
I mean, if-if you'd stop
for a second and listen,

03:59.413 --> 04:01.371
maybe this wouldn't come
as such a shock to you.

04:01.415 --> 04:02.894
What?

04:02.938 --> 04:04.331
What is supposed to come
as such a shock to me, Deeks?

04:04.374 --> 04:05.593
Divorce.

04:05.636 --> 04:07.290
What?

04:07.334 --> 04:09.553
Raquel's divorce.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.729
Who's Ra...

04:11.773 --> 04:15.429
Rachel?

04:15.472 --> 04:17.561
Our brand-new neighbor
who we barely know, Rachel.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.302
Speak for yourself.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.261
Don't underestimate how deeply
you can bond with someone

04:21.304 --> 04:23.263
- during trash day.
- Okay.

04:23.306 --> 04:24.394
Has it ever occurred to you that

04:24.438 --> 04:25.787
maybe you shouldn't be
inserting yourself

04:25.830 --> 04:27.397
in other people's business?

04:27.441 --> 04:30.400
No. I mean, literally never.

04:30.444 --> 04:31.793
I married a yenta.

04:31.836 --> 04:32.924
Oh, a person that strives

04:32.968 --> 04:34.491
for knowledge
and human connection,

04:34.535 --> 04:36.580
[chuckles]that's also a century
ahead of their time?

04:36.624 --> 04:37.799
Then, yes,
why, thank you.

04:37.842 --> 04:39.714
That is "Yentl."
And don't flatter yourself.

04:39.757 --> 04:41.933
Listen, I'm not gonna apologize
for having an innate ability

04:41.977 --> 04:43.761
to bond with people
very quickly.

04:43.805 --> 04:45.676
It's what makes me such a
fantastic special investigator.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.330
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

04:47.374 --> 04:48.679
It's not "special investigator."

04:48.723 --> 04:50.333
It's just "investigator."

04:50.377 --> 04:51.813
Investigator.
Special agent.

04:51.856 --> 04:52.944
Are you sure?
Absolutely.

04:52.988 --> 04:54.076
That doesn't sound right.

04:54.119 --> 04:55.425
None of this conversation
sounds right.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.775
Who do I talk to about
changing my title?

04:57.819 --> 04:58.907
- That would be me.
- What?

04:58.950 --> 05:01.344
Unfortunately,
I don't run my office

05:01.388 --> 05:03.303
like a Silver Lake preschool,

05:03.346 --> 05:05.435
so you're actually
gonna have to do something

05:05.479 --> 05:06.828
to get a reward
around here.

05:07.872 --> 05:10.658
Rachel?
Yes. Rachel.

05:10.701 --> 05:12.224
<i>She's like a virus.</i>

05:12.268 --> 05:14.618
You have no idea how hard it is
to get rid of her

05:14.662 --> 05:16.316
once she takes hold.

05:16.359 --> 05:18.274
You'd be surprised.

05:19.493 --> 05:21.582
I'm sorry I ran earlier.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.758
I tend to be a little
paranoid these days.

05:23.801 --> 05:25.977
I understand.

05:26.021 --> 05:27.370
I really don't know
why you're here, though.

05:27.414 --> 05:30.330
Kate and I broke up
a long time ago.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.333
Her name is not Kate.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.597
What are you talking about?

05:36.640 --> 05:37.989
She lied to you.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.775
Her name is
Katya Miranova,

05:40.818 --> 05:42.472
and she is a Russian national.

05:44.518 --> 05:46.694
And here I thought she was
from Barstow.

05:48.696 --> 05:51.307
Did your breakup have anything
to do with her time in prison?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.396
As hard as it is to believe,

05:53.440 --> 05:55.572
that would have been
the least of our problems.

05:55.616 --> 05:57.400
It was before that.

05:57.444 --> 06:00.490
But you still chose to go
to her arraignment.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.753
It's cute that you think
I had a choice.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.758
She does have a way of getting
people to do what she wants.

06:10.718 --> 06:12.981
Has she tried to contact you
lately?

06:13.024 --> 06:16.985
When I heard she broke out
of prison, I packed up and ran.

06:17.028 --> 06:19.683
Changed my number.
Deleted my online presence.

06:19.727 --> 06:22.556
Haven't heard from her since.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.993
Look...

06:26.821 --> 06:28.692
I'd like you to help me
find her.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.520
No.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.479
No, I'm trying very hard
to forget her.

06:32.522 --> 06:34.524
I think it's a little late
for that.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.570
Why do you care so much
about finding her anyway?

06:39.573 --> 06:41.444
She got to someone close to you,

06:41.488 --> 06:44.012
didn't she?

06:44.055 --> 06:47.929
Like you said, she's a virus.

06:51.541 --> 06:54.457
I wish I could help,
but I can't.

06:59.636 --> 07:01.421
If you change your mind.

07:11.474 --> 07:15.435
You double-bolt your door,
you run from strangers.

07:16.479 --> 07:19.700
You're never gonna be free
until Katya no longer is.

07:31.059 --> 07:34.454
No. No, I don't have any pets.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.499
But I could have them
if that helps.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.501
I'm flexible,
and did I mention responsible?

07:38.545 --> 07:40.111
I did, right.

07:40.155 --> 07:41.765
I'll double
the security deposit.

07:41.809 --> 07:44.376
Hello? Hello?

07:47.554 --> 07:49.860
Admiral Kilbride.
I, uh, was just...

07:49.904 --> 07:51.993
Believe me,
I don't need to know.

07:52.036 --> 07:53.951
I'm just trying to get out
of my parents' house,

07:53.995 --> 07:56.780
but finding an apartment
for rent in L.A. is impossible.

07:56.824 --> 07:58.478
I mean,
the market is insane.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.523
You either have to know
someone who's moving out,

08:00.567 --> 08:03.439
or someone who died
and is moving out.

08:05.833 --> 08:09.793
God forbid the Zennials,
or whatever hashtag

08:09.837 --> 08:11.795
we are currently
employing to denote

08:11.839 --> 08:14.668
a generation of
livestreamed laziness,

08:14.711 --> 08:17.845
actually do anything
on their own.

08:17.888 --> 08:20.543
Technically, I'm a millennial.

08:20.587 --> 08:21.979
And technically,
I didn't come in here

08:22.023 --> 08:23.807
to mourn the loss
of an eat-in kitchen.

08:23.851 --> 08:24.982
I trust you saw

08:25.026 --> 08:26.593
the case I sent you.

08:26.636 --> 08:27.898
The case. Yeah.

08:27.942 --> 08:30.640
Yeah, yes,
of course I did.

08:30.684 --> 08:33.817
Then you are well aware that,
effective immediately,

08:33.861 --> 08:37.517
NCIS is taking over
an ATF investigation

08:37.560 --> 08:39.649
into a very large supply

08:39.693 --> 08:42.478
of stolen and currently
missing weapons.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.436
Yes, well aware, sir.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.135
Uh, effective immediately,
NCIS is taking over

08:47.178 --> 08:48.528
because...

08:48.571 --> 08:51.052
Because over 500 shotguns,

08:51.095 --> 08:54.925
rifles, and semiautomatic
pistols are in the wind,

08:54.969 --> 08:57.449
and because ATF is
down a few agents,

08:57.493 --> 08:59.190
they could use our help.

09:00.844 --> 09:03.804
Well, uh...
a supply that large could

09:03.847 --> 09:05.980
easily go for over a million
on the black market.

09:06.023 --> 09:07.677
Someone could try to sell them.

09:07.721 --> 09:08.722
Or worse.

09:08.765 --> 09:10.201
If someone stole them

09:10.245 --> 09:12.595
because they're
planning an attack...

09:12.639 --> 09:14.728
Then they would have enough
to weaponize an entire army.

09:14.771 --> 09:17.818
And since they were stolen
four days ago,

09:17.861 --> 09:20.908
we, and by that I mean you,

09:20.951 --> 09:24.912
are four days behind
figuring out which it is.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.698
Okay, well, uh...

09:28.742 --> 09:31.658
Do I have any leads?

09:31.701 --> 09:34.486
The ATF has a prime suspect.

09:34.530 --> 09:37.054
Oh, well, that sounds
like a good start.

09:37.098 --> 09:40.231
It would be, if he hadn't been
found dead three days ago.

09:42.538 --> 09:44.627
Do you know if he rented?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.907
Is it possible that
my sternum is bruised?

10:03.951 --> 10:05.735
It's probably just your ego.

10:05.779 --> 10:07.563
So, what happened
out there, anyway?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.609
Let's just say me and Sam
started off on the wrong foot

10:09.652 --> 10:11.219
- this morning.
- He was late.

10:11.262 --> 10:12.307
Ah.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.569
Guess you don't know

10:13.613 --> 10:14.831
about Lombardi Time.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.659
As in Vince Lombardi?

10:16.703 --> 10:18.530
He said,
"If you're five minutes early,

10:18.574 --> 10:19.836
you're already
ten minutes late."

10:19.880 --> 10:21.055
Sam gave me his biography.

10:21.098 --> 10:22.230
- I can lend it to you.
- How about instead

10:22.273 --> 10:23.971
we stop talking
and get to the case.

10:24.014 --> 10:27.191
Sounds like somebody's been
reading my dream journal.

10:27.235 --> 10:29.280
Agent Namazi.

10:29.324 --> 10:31.674
A truckload of guns
was stolen last Thursday

10:31.718 --> 10:34.285
at around 10:00 p.m.
from a rest stop in Tujunga.

10:34.329 --> 10:35.765
It was en route

10:35.809 --> 10:37.549
from Phoenix to
a gun shop in Downey

10:37.593 --> 10:38.899
at the time
and was scheduled

10:38.942 --> 10:40.857
to continue south
to the Marine Corp Exchange

10:40.901 --> 10:42.729
at Pendleton after that.

10:42.772 --> 10:44.165
Cameras didn't catch anything.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.602
Commercial firearms
are transported all the time

10:46.646 --> 10:48.256
through private carriers
and mail services.

10:48.299 --> 10:51.128
So I'm surprised this
doesn't happen more often.

10:51.172 --> 10:53.000
Tell us about
the dead suspect.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.915
Anders Sivac.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.786
Found stabbed to
death the morning after.

10:56.830 --> 10:59.180
Formerly of Brentwood,
by way of Malibu.

10:59.223 --> 11:01.138
Looks like he's lived
in every high-end neighborhood

11:01.182 --> 11:02.531
in the city.

11:02.574 --> 11:04.838
That's because he is
the son of Marten Sivac,

11:04.881 --> 11:07.667
the notorious L.A. crime boss.

11:08.755 --> 11:11.845
Technically he was
the alleged L.A. crime boss.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.718
Well, he was accused of
everything from money laundering

11:15.762 --> 11:17.328
to drug smuggling,

11:17.372 --> 11:19.113
but somehow his family members
or associates

11:19.156 --> 11:20.854
always took the fall.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.290
Money can buy
a hell of a defense.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.335
Tell us about the father.
Where is he now?

11:24.379 --> 11:25.728
Also dead.

11:25.772 --> 11:26.947
Found at the bottom
of Lake Arrowhead

11:26.990 --> 11:28.470
three years ago.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.994
And the family has been
seemingly quiet since he died.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.256
Until now.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.171
Sivac's been living
a privileged life.

11:34.215 --> 11:35.956
He could burn through
a lot of money in three years.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.261
Yeah. That could
have inspired him

11:37.305 --> 11:39.133
to get the business
back up and running.

11:39.176 --> 11:40.743
He could've been in
over his head.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.092
So...

11:42.136 --> 11:44.965
finding out who killed him is
our best chance

11:45.008 --> 11:47.010
at finding the missing weapons.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.925
Well, Kensi is on her way
to meet Callen at the morgue.

11:48.969 --> 11:50.231
And Deeks is meeting
with Sivac's stepmother

11:50.274 --> 11:51.754
to see what she knows.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.060
All right. We'll talk
to the driver who was

11:53.103 --> 11:54.191
carrying the guns.
Keep us posted.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.237
Will do.

11:58.239 --> 12:00.937
I was thinking sax solo.

12:00.981 --> 12:03.331
It's smooth.
It's sexy.

12:03.374 --> 12:05.202
It's the Sade of woodwinds.

12:05.246 --> 12:06.856
Now, I haven't played
in 20 years,

12:06.900 --> 12:08.989
but what better time
for the Baritone Bandit

12:09.032 --> 12:11.382
to ride again
than at his own wedding.

12:11.426 --> 12:14.298
Sounds like congratulations
- are in order.
- Mm.

12:14.342 --> 12:15.909
Agent Callen. Agent Blye.

12:15.952 --> 12:17.954
Who is the lucky lady?

12:17.998 --> 12:19.129
You remember Zoe?

12:19.173 --> 12:22.089
You're marrying
FBI Agent Morris?

12:22.132 --> 12:23.786
...'s cousin,

12:23.830 --> 12:25.832
Chloe Morris.

12:25.875 --> 12:28.878
She's an aerialist,
so she's also a risk-taker.

12:28.922 --> 12:30.880
Says it's why she agreed
to marry me.

12:30.924 --> 12:33.665
She says that a lot, actually.

12:33.709 --> 12:34.928
We're happy, though.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.886
As long as you're
happy, right?

12:36.930 --> 12:39.671
But you didn't come all the way
down here to congratulate me.

12:39.715 --> 12:40.803
Unless you did? Did you?

12:40.847 --> 12:42.239
N-Not e-exactly.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.894
We're investigating
the murder of Anders Sivac.

12:44.938 --> 12:46.287
The guy they found
in Griffith Park?

12:46.330 --> 12:47.767
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.420
I thought that
ATF had that case.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.118
Yeah, we're lending a hand.
What can you tell us about him?

12:51.161 --> 12:54.774
Body was found off a fire road
near the Observatory.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.123
He was stabbed 22 times.

12:56.166 --> 12:57.820
22 times?

12:57.864 --> 12:58.952
Sounds like
this might be personal.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.127
Hmm.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.389
Can you pinpoint
time of death?

13:01.432 --> 13:03.783
Uh, hikers found the body
at 9:00 a.m.,

13:03.826 --> 13:06.089
but based on exposure,
blood pooling,

13:06.133 --> 13:07.917
I'd put it
about 12 hours earlier.

13:07.961 --> 13:10.833
Which would be about an hour
before the guns were stolen.

13:10.877 --> 13:13.053
Yeah. So either this was
a deal gone terribly wrong,

13:13.096 --> 13:14.358
or somebody found out
what Sivac was planning

13:14.402 --> 13:16.360
and decided to kill him
to take over.

13:16.404 --> 13:18.188
Well, either way, we're
gonna need to see his files.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.364
Yes, we are.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.847
Oh, that's me. Right?

13:43.866 --> 13:46.260
Not the best timing,
but since you're here,

13:46.303 --> 13:47.827
let's make it quick.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.089
And leave your shirt on
this time.

13:49.132 --> 13:52.353
I think there's been
some sort of mistake.

13:54.007 --> 13:55.835
The only mistake was letting
the neighbors take photos.

13:55.878 --> 13:58.881
Also, there's a dead squirrel
in the deep end.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.883
It looked like he struggled,

14:00.927 --> 14:02.363
so don't be chintzy
with the chlorine.

14:02.406 --> 14:04.017
Yeah, now I definitely know
there's a mistake,

14:04.060 --> 14:05.801
'cause I'm not here
to clean your pool.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.282
- Then why am I paying you?
- You're not.

14:08.325 --> 14:09.892
Investigator Martin Atticus Deeks.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.851
NCIS.
I'm here about your son.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.809
- Stepson.
- Right.

14:13.853 --> 14:17.073
Stepson, so obviously
my condolences.

14:17.117 --> 14:18.248
Oh, save it.

14:18.292 --> 14:19.510
Anders was a son of a bitch.

14:19.554 --> 14:20.903
Believe me,
I knew his mother.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.123
And as I told
the other agents,

14:23.166 --> 14:24.907
we were estranged,

14:24.951 --> 14:25.995
so I hadn't talked to him
in weeks.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.997
Can you tell me why?

14:31.044 --> 14:33.350
In the 20 years
I was married to his father,

14:33.394 --> 14:34.917
he never approved of me.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.180
Turns out,
he didn't approve of

14:37.224 --> 14:38.442
my moving on, either.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.053
And I have moved on

14:40.096 --> 14:42.403
many, many times.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.406
Right. I'll just put that down

14:45.449 --> 14:47.321
as you guys had
a falling-out, then?

14:48.365 --> 14:52.021
Even mothers have needs,
Investigator Deeks.

14:52.065 --> 14:54.850
Wow. Yeah.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.418
If I had a dime
for every time I heard that.

14:57.461 --> 14:59.202
Forgive me if I'm not
a puddle of tears.

14:59.246 --> 15:00.812
As I'm sure you're aware,

15:00.856 --> 15:02.336
ours is a very
complicated family.

15:02.379 --> 15:04.773
We've seen our share
of deaths.

15:04.816 --> 15:07.210
So I suppose you get used to it
after a while.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.386
So, did Anders have any enemies?
Anybody that wanted him dead?

15:11.171 --> 15:13.042
Ah, how much time do you have?

15:13.086 --> 15:14.435
Two hours. Maybe five.

15:14.478 --> 15:16.524
Seven if I tell my boss
he's pretty.
Hmm.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.439
- That was rhetorical.
- I know.

15:18.482 --> 15:19.875
But I also know
how to properly chlorinate

15:19.919 --> 15:21.398
the after effects
of a decaying rodent,

15:21.442 --> 15:23.574
so if you let me inside
and answer some questions,

15:23.618 --> 15:26.012
I'll, uh, get rid of
your furry little friend,

15:26.055 --> 15:27.927
at no additional cost
to management.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.841
Hmm.

15:29.885 --> 15:31.974
Hope you don't mind gin.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.845
Oh, I don't drink and work,
but thank you.

15:33.889 --> 15:35.499
I wasn't offering.

15:35.543 --> 15:38.241
Oh, good to clarify that.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.373
All right.

15:39.416 --> 15:41.462
Go.

15:41.505 --> 15:43.943
- Dude. Dude.
- Oh.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.379
No, you don't have to--
I'm sorry.

15:45.422 --> 15:46.467
You didn't have to do that.

15:46.510 --> 15:47.903
No, it's cool.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.905
Gary's like a brother to me.
He's super chill.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.907
He's also super allergic
to shellfish,

15:51.951 --> 15:53.517
so he's not invited
to the wedding.

15:53.561 --> 15:55.432
Chloe loves shrimp.

15:55.476 --> 15:56.999
Are these all the personal items

15:57.043 --> 15:58.479
- that were found at the site?
That's everything.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.307
Unfortunately, the only prints
on them were his own.

16:00.350 --> 16:01.873
Whoa.

16:01.917 --> 16:04.006
Well, this is a very fancy watch
to leave on a body.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.399
Must be hard to tell time

16:05.442 --> 16:07.096
with all that bling
in your face.

16:07.140 --> 16:08.097
Judging by the depth,

16:08.141 --> 16:09.881
small table,
heavy crowns,

16:09.925 --> 16:11.971
I'd say those babies
are old European.

16:12.014 --> 16:14.538
Chloe also loves diamonds.

16:14.582 --> 16:16.627
And I love selling vitamins
over the phone at night

16:16.671 --> 16:18.368
so I can afford
to give them to her.

16:18.412 --> 16:19.543
What is that?

16:19.587 --> 16:21.154
I think it's a cry for help.

16:21.197 --> 16:22.503
No, no, no, on his wrist.

16:22.546 --> 16:24.026
Looks like there's some
kind of marking here.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.159
Oh, yeah, no, that's--
It's definitely...

16:26.202 --> 16:27.508
ink.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.640
I just, I couldn't...
um, trace the source.

16:29.684 --> 16:30.946
Hmm, it could be a stamp,

16:30.990 --> 16:33.296
maybe from a nightclub
or a bar.

16:33.340 --> 16:34.384
Well, if that's the case,

16:34.428 --> 16:35.559
this kind of ink
only stays on the body

16:35.603 --> 16:37.213
for, what, a day at the most?

16:37.257 --> 16:38.606
Well, if he was dead
for 12 of those hours,

16:38.649 --> 16:40.216
it might mean he was there
not long before he died.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.653
Hmm. So if we can figure out
where the stamp is from,

16:42.697 --> 16:44.525
we may be able
to retrace Sivac's movements

16:44.568 --> 16:46.005
- leading up to his death.
- Mm-hmm.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.441
I'm gonna have Fatima
get on this.

16:52.533 --> 16:55.188
So, you ever get down
with St. John's Wort?

17:00.628 --> 17:03.152
I think you should start
with a joke.

17:03.196 --> 17:05.676
I think I'll just start by
asking about the missing guns.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.070
No, I'm talking
about for your speech.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.029
It's a good way to make
an introduction.

17:10.072 --> 17:12.161
I took a public speaking course
once.

17:12.205 --> 17:14.598
Well, the only course

17:14.642 --> 17:16.165
that truck.

17:16.209 --> 17:17.601
Phoenix to Downey.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.081
Quickest route is the 10.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.127
Well, the truck stop
where the guns were stolen

17:21.170 --> 17:22.345
was in Tujunga.

17:22.389 --> 17:23.651
That's off the 210.

17:23.694 --> 17:25.566
That's like 20 miles
out of the way.

17:25.609 --> 17:27.307
Put him behind schedule
at least an hour.

17:27.350 --> 17:28.612
Hmm?

17:28.656 --> 17:31.050
Well, some truck drivers
get paid by the mile.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.399
Mm-hmm.

17:32.442 --> 17:33.965
Could have been trying to earn
a few extra bucks,

17:34.009 --> 17:36.098
or maybe avoid traffic,

17:36.142 --> 17:38.100
or maybe he was hungry.

17:38.144 --> 17:40.102
Or maybe we should
just ask him.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.104
David Milton?

17:42.148 --> 17:43.105
NCIS.

18:05.214 --> 18:08.130
I guess that's another way
to make an introduction.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.612
I would've went with a joke.

18:23.798 --> 18:25.756
All right. Thanks,
Fatima. Good job.

18:26.757 --> 18:28.411
You get anything
from him?

18:28.455 --> 18:30.413
Besides another bruise, no.

18:30.457 --> 18:32.589
Officers, please.
You don't understand.

18:32.633 --> 18:33.634
We understand enough to
not believe a word

18:33.677 --> 18:35.026
that's coming out
of your mouth.

18:35.070 --> 18:36.376
And stop calling us officers.

18:36.419 --> 18:38.639
We're not LAPD. We're NCIS.

18:38.682 --> 18:41.120
And I'm an INFJ with PTSD.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.469
I hate confrontation,

18:42.512 --> 18:44.732
and I've been hurt before,
that's why I ran.

18:44.775 --> 18:46.734
Tell us about the night
your truck was robbed.

18:46.777 --> 18:49.476
It happened so fast.

18:49.519 --> 18:51.478
One minute I was getting coffee,
the next I was knocked out.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.480
Must have been some damn good
coffee for you to drive

18:53.523 --> 18:54.568
so far out of your way for it.

18:54.611 --> 18:55.830
Huh?

18:55.873 --> 18:58.180
As I told ATF,
I like a change of scenery.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.355
Oh, well, that's good
'cause you're looking at

18:59.399 --> 19:00.617
20 years behind bars.

19:00.661 --> 19:02.706
ATF didn't have enough
to get a warrant

19:02.750 --> 19:04.230
on your bank records,
but now that

19:04.273 --> 19:06.057
you're officially a suspect,
we do.

19:06.101 --> 19:07.189
We know you deposited 20,000

19:07.233 --> 19:08.625
after the guns were stolen.

19:08.669 --> 19:10.497
And we know you spread it
over three days

19:10.540 --> 19:12.194
knowing the bank wouldn't
flag it.

19:12.238 --> 19:13.674
Yeah. Now that we know
you're an accomplice

19:13.717 --> 19:16.198
to the theft,
wouldn't be surprised

19:16.242 --> 19:18.722
if aiding and abetting
terrorist activities comes next.

19:18.766 --> 19:20.768
I'm not a terrorist.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.378
I'm just broke.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.424
I needed some money,

19:24.467 --> 19:26.295
so I put an ad on the dark web
for the guns.

19:26.339 --> 19:28.602
A guy made an offer,
and I turned a blind eye

19:28.645 --> 19:30.604
while he took them.

19:31.866 --> 19:34.477
Is this the guy
you were dealing with?

19:35.522 --> 19:37.567
For most of it.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.482
I got a call at the last minute
from someone else.

19:39.526 --> 19:40.701
Said he was an associate.

19:40.744 --> 19:43.182
I was supposed to drive
to Griffith Park,

19:43.225 --> 19:45.184
but he told me to go
to Tujunga instead.

19:45.227 --> 19:47.577
Hmm. And which one of them
did this to your face?

19:47.621 --> 19:49.666
Neither.

19:49.710 --> 19:52.191
I gave my baby brother 50 bucks
and a ten-pound dumbbell.

19:52.234 --> 19:55.368
Well, I'm sure that saved him
years of therapy.

19:56.847 --> 19:59.110
Okay.
I need your phone.

19:59.154 --> 20:00.590
Uh, it's in the truck.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.201
Please,
can you let me go now?

20:02.244 --> 20:04.333
I've learned my lesson.

20:04.377 --> 20:05.856
I swear.

20:08.729 --> 20:11.732
Yeah.
He doesn't give lessons.

20:13.647 --> 20:15.214
I've got some good news
and bad news.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.519
Will the good news
help us solve this case?

20:16.563 --> 20:18.565
It should get us
in the general vicinity.

20:18.608 --> 20:20.175
Then let's start with that.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.786
So you were right. The ink mark
on Sivac's wrist

20:22.830 --> 20:24.135
was from a stamp.

20:24.179 --> 20:25.485
I was able to digitally
recreate

20:25.528 --> 20:27.226
the original outline
of the image.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.705
I'm sending it
to both your phones now.

20:28.749 --> 20:30.751
Okay. What is the bad news?

20:30.794 --> 20:32.883
I missed a call while
I was doing it

20:32.927 --> 20:34.363
and lost out on
another apartment.

20:34.407 --> 20:35.364
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:35.408 --> 20:36.539
Hey, is this a snake?

20:36.583 --> 20:38.889
Technically,
it's a ball python.

20:38.933 --> 20:42.719
I also work weekends in the
reptile section of a Petco.

20:45.418 --> 20:46.897
Any idea where
Sivac got it?

20:46.941 --> 20:47.898
Sort of.

20:47.942 --> 20:49.552
It appears to be the logo

20:49.596 --> 20:51.859
of the Vandergrift
Hospitality Group.

20:51.902 --> 20:54.557
They own bars and clubs
all over Southern California.

20:54.601 --> 20:57.299
Normally I'd cross-reference
each one with the GPS

20:57.343 --> 21:00.171
from Sivac's phone or car,
but both were disabled.

21:00.215 --> 21:02.739
Hmm.
And what time do
these places open?

21:02.783 --> 21:04.567
Uh, around 10:00 p.m.
for the clubs,

21:04.611 --> 21:06.265
and 8:00 p.m. for the bars.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.354
So, if Sivac was killed
at 9:00 p.m.,

21:08.397 --> 21:09.703
that would eliminate the clubs.

21:09.746 --> 21:11.574
And if he had time to
go to the bar,

21:11.618 --> 21:14.838
and then up to Griffith Park,
he couldn't have been that far.

21:14.882 --> 21:16.362
So if I narrow down the search

21:16.405 --> 21:20.279
to a five-mile radius
of the park, we get...

21:20.322 --> 21:22.411
Sanctuary Bar & Lounge
on Hillhurst.

21:22.455 --> 21:24.587
I'll start pulling
security footage now.

21:24.631 --> 21:26.850
Let's do it.

21:26.894 --> 21:29.636
Some things get better with age.

21:29.679 --> 21:32.682
Cheese. Scotch.

21:32.726 --> 21:36.556
The 401that will one day
take me far away

21:36.599 --> 21:40.777
from this botox-ed juice shack
of a city.

21:40.821 --> 21:42.301
With all due respect,
you didn't call

21:42.344 --> 21:43.824
to talk retirement plans.

21:43.867 --> 21:46.305
No, I did not, Agent Hanna.

21:46.348 --> 21:50.396
But you see, there is one thing
that is not aging well,

21:50.439 --> 21:52.833
and it's this investigation.

21:52.876 --> 21:54.356
The ATF gave us nothing.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.315
We basically started
from scratch.

21:56.358 --> 21:59.492
And I basically had to offer
SECNAV my timeshare in Boca

21:59.535 --> 22:00.623
for the next two years

22:00.667 --> 22:03.147
just to get her off my back.

22:03.191 --> 22:04.801
Now stop telling me
what we don't know,

22:04.845 --> 22:06.629
and let's start with
what we do.

22:06.673 --> 22:10.459
Okay. We know Sivac arranged to
take the missing gun supply.

22:10.503 --> 22:13.984
But it seems he was killed an
hour before they were stolen.

22:14.028 --> 22:15.856
And soon after that,
someone called the truck driver

22:15.899 --> 22:17.945
to reroute the meeting
to a new spot.

22:17.988 --> 22:19.773
So, if I were a gambling man,

22:19.816 --> 22:22.819
and as cited in my first
divorce, I am,

22:22.863 --> 22:26.562
I'd say that whoever placed
that call could tell us

22:26.606 --> 22:28.782
where we might find
those stolen weapons.

22:28.825 --> 22:29.826
Since that person used
a burner phone,

22:29.870 --> 22:30.958
we don't know who that was.

22:31.001 --> 22:32.263
I might be able to change that.

22:32.307 --> 22:34.265
The phone that called
the truck driver

22:34.309 --> 22:37.399
was off-line until this morning,
when it placed two more calls

22:37.443 --> 22:40.402
to an insurance broker
in Eagle Rock.

22:40.446 --> 22:42.448
So, either they got
a sudden desire

22:42.491 --> 22:45.015
to protect their
ill-gotten possessions...

22:45.059 --> 22:46.930
Or the insurance broker
could be a buyer.

22:46.974 --> 22:48.628
I will have Agent Castor

22:48.671 --> 22:52.719
take him to the boatshed
so you can find out.

22:52.762 --> 22:54.895
Perfect timing.
I have more good news.

22:54.938 --> 22:57.506
You have security footage
from inside the bar?

22:57.550 --> 22:59.595
No, not yet. I'm trying
to get their tapes,

22:59.639 --> 23:01.075
but we're just waiting
on a warrant

23:01.118 --> 23:02.772
because they want to protect
themselves from a lawsuit.

23:02.816 --> 23:03.991
So I'm guessing
that the good news

23:04.034 --> 23:05.514
is pertaining to
an apartment?

23:05.558 --> 23:08.387
Yep. Turns out this one
is being knocked down.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.040
How is that good news?

23:10.084 --> 23:12.695
Well, it isn't for the housing
crisis, but for us it's good.

23:12.739 --> 23:14.784
Okay, what is happening?

23:14.828 --> 23:17.787
So, an apartment building across
from the Sanctuary Bar & Lounge

23:17.831 --> 23:20.007
is being rebuilt into a hotel.

23:20.050 --> 23:21.312
Now, they have
a work zone camera

23:21.356 --> 23:23.576
that's currently running
24 hours a day.

23:23.619 --> 23:26.535
It has a perfect view
of the bar's front entrance,

23:26.579 --> 23:28.581
which is how I found this.

23:30.974 --> 23:33.412
- Anders Sivac.
Mm-hmm.

23:33.455 --> 23:34.674
So he shows up to
the bar by himself,

23:34.717 --> 23:36.980
but he doesn't leave alone.

23:37.024 --> 23:40.549
That's Miriam Sivac,
his stepmother.

23:40.593 --> 23:43.726
The thing is, she told Deeks
she hadn't seen him in weeks.

23:45.075 --> 23:46.773
Hmm.

23:46.816 --> 23:50.733
Sorry that took so long.
This one's extra dirty.

23:50.777 --> 23:52.953
Well, it might not be
the only one.

23:54.998 --> 23:57.523
I never cared much
for the theater,

23:57.566 --> 23:59.002
so if you have something to say,

23:59.046 --> 24:00.874
you can skip the performance
and just say it.

24:00.917 --> 24:03.354
You met with Anders the night
he died; we have footage.

24:03.398 --> 24:05.400
And I have the business
card of my lawyer.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.794
- Allow me to go get it for you.
- Did you kill him?

24:07.837 --> 24:10.623
Oh, please, I couldn't hurt
a squirrel.

24:15.018 --> 24:17.499
You'll remember,
I married into this family,

24:17.543 --> 24:19.370
I wasn't born into it.

24:19.414 --> 24:21.547
Well, congratulations.
Then you're just a liar.

24:22.983 --> 24:25.507
Anders was an idiot,

24:25.551 --> 24:28.684
and he was in over his head.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.991
I knew he was brokering
a deal for those weapons.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.122
We all did.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.124
He was a horrible combination

24:34.168 --> 24:37.780
of cocky and sloppy.

24:37.824 --> 24:40.522
I went to the bar
to talk him out of it.

24:40.566 --> 24:43.960
He didn't listen,
and he got himself killed.

24:45.962 --> 24:48.051
Do you know anything else
about those weapons?

24:48.095 --> 24:50.576
I assure you I do not.

24:50.619 --> 24:52.665
But you said that other
family members knew,

24:52.708 --> 24:54.493
So maybe it was an inside job.

24:54.536 --> 24:57.757
I believe I've answered enough
of your questions for today.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.585
That's funny. I believe that
when I showed up you said

24:59.628 --> 25:00.977
you were in a hurry, but you
never really mentioned

25:01.021 --> 25:03.763
where you're going.

25:03.806 --> 25:06.679
Anders' funeral is
this afternoon.

25:06.722 --> 25:08.594
Oh, well, that's interesting,
right?

25:08.637 --> 25:10.726
Because if somebody
associated with the family

25:10.770 --> 25:12.554
did kill him, they would
look pretty guilty

25:12.598 --> 25:14.556
if they didn't show up
to pay their respects.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.993
Well, Miriam,

25:17.037 --> 25:19.953
looks like you and I
have a date.

25:22.869 --> 25:25.959
You forget who
you're dealing with.

25:26.002 --> 25:28.178
No one's going to say a word
if they know you're there.

25:28.222 --> 25:30.572
I know. Which is why
you're gonna help

25:30.616 --> 25:31.965
make sure they don't.

25:48.982 --> 25:51.158
God, I don't like funerals.
You know what?

25:51.201 --> 25:53.116
When it's my time to ride
the final wave of life,

25:53.160 --> 25:54.509
just compost me.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.119
There is no way you are
going in our garden.

25:56.163 --> 25:57.556
We have enough weeds already.

25:57.599 --> 25:58.818
Plus, I'd rather donate
my body to science.

25:58.861 --> 26:00.036
Uh-huh, baby, we don't
even have a garden

26:00.080 --> 26:02.517
because you can't even
keep a cactus alive.

26:02.561 --> 26:03.866
Callen, what about you?

26:03.910 --> 26:05.825
Oh, that's easy.
Viking funeral.

26:05.868 --> 26:08.218
Only if I get to use Sam's boat.

26:08.262 --> 26:11.047
How we looking back there?

26:11.091 --> 26:12.614
Eh, looks like <i>Sopranos</i>

26:12.658 --> 26:15.051
did a crossover
with <i>Long Island Medium.</i>

26:15.095 --> 26:16.923
People are starting
to trickle in.

26:20.143 --> 26:22.798
And I'm taking photos
of everybody as is

26:22.842 --> 26:24.234
and sending them back to Ops.

26:24.278 --> 26:26.585
Good. The sooner we get
IDs on everyone,

26:26.628 --> 26:28.021
the sooner we can start
tracing their whereabouts

26:28.064 --> 26:29.631
the night Sivac was murdered.

26:29.675 --> 26:31.981
The closer we'll be to
finding those stolen weapons.

26:32.025 --> 26:33.679
Great. And the sooner
and closer I'll be

26:33.722 --> 26:37.552
to getting the big smell
of tiny little fish off my body.

26:37.596 --> 26:38.858
I got sardine pants
over here.

26:38.901 --> 26:41.556
Okay, okay, okay.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.517
He thinks he's here
to insure something for us.

26:46.561 --> 26:48.084
Great job. Thanks.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.218
Gentlemen.

26:51.261 --> 26:52.959
- Hey.
- As I told your colleague,

26:53.002 --> 26:55.091
I usually prefer to take
my new clients out to lunch.

26:55.135 --> 26:57.746
Ah, well, these are
unusual circumstances.

26:57.790 --> 26:59.618
Yeah, they require
some more discretion.

26:59.661 --> 27:02.229
Ah. Say no more.
I understand.

27:02.272 --> 27:05.014
Now, what are we insuring?
Big game?

27:05.058 --> 27:06.929
Oh, I'd say it's
pretty big.

27:06.973 --> 27:08.801
Well, I'm a vegetarian

27:08.844 --> 27:11.673
and a Catholic, so I'm
already racked with guilt.

27:11.717 --> 27:15.590
But I like you, so I'm in.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.679
What are we talking?
Just the animal's head,

27:17.723 --> 27:19.812
or all the way down
to the haunches?

27:19.855 --> 27:22.031
What do you say we go whole hog?

27:22.075 --> 27:24.164
Start with a million dollars'
worth of stolen guns.

27:28.124 --> 27:29.604
Unfortunately, gentlemen,
firearms aren't

27:29.648 --> 27:30.779
my area of expertise.

27:30.823 --> 27:31.780
Yeah, that's obvious.

27:31.824 --> 27:33.173
Pretty dumb doing deals

27:33.216 --> 27:34.696
on your personal phone.

27:34.740 --> 27:37.699
I'd be happy to refer you
to a competitor.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.135
How about instead
you refer us to

27:39.179 --> 27:40.746
the person who called you
twice this morning?

27:42.225 --> 27:44.793
I'm not sure what
you're talking about.

27:44.837 --> 27:46.969
And if you don't mind,
I should be going.

27:47.013 --> 27:49.668
I'm pretty sure we do mind.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.147
And you're not going anywhere

27:51.191 --> 27:53.628
until you help us
find those guns.

27:59.199 --> 28:01.201
Losing someone is never easy.

28:01.244 --> 28:03.203
But as I always say,

28:03.246 --> 28:05.684
even in death we nourish.

28:07.337 --> 28:09.209
I would say that was deep

28:09.252 --> 28:10.993
if I didn't know
it was the motto

28:11.037 --> 28:12.691
from the side of
the catering truck.

28:12.734 --> 28:16.085
Kind of running low on ways
to say I'm sorry.

28:16.129 --> 28:17.739
And we're running low
on potential suspects.

28:17.783 --> 28:20.307
The man you were just
talking to is Howard Berkner,

28:20.350 --> 28:21.874
family endodontist.

28:21.917 --> 28:24.180
His roots with the Sivac family
don't run much deeper.

28:24.224 --> 28:26.922
Oh, wow, I love it.
High five for wordplay.

28:26.966 --> 28:30.360
What about the smiling lovebirds
I just sent you there?

28:30.404 --> 28:31.710
Brock Belmont

28:31.753 --> 28:33.015
and his wife Rose.

28:33.059 --> 28:36.062
Looks like they own
a construction business

28:36.105 --> 28:37.933
as well as several
shell companies.

28:37.977 --> 28:40.849
Well, that sounds ripe
for scandal.

28:40.893 --> 28:42.198
So does a trip to Cabo
with your mistress,

28:42.242 --> 28:44.374
which is what Mr. Belmont
was on last week

28:44.418 --> 28:45.724
when Anders Sivac was killed.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.377
His wife, on the other hand,

28:47.421 --> 28:50.163
was in Aspen with
her best friend's husband.

28:50.206 --> 28:53.383
Wow. And they seem so happy.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.777
I got someone.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.866
Sending it to you now.

28:57.910 --> 28:59.738
Got him. Running him
through the system

28:59.781 --> 29:00.782
as we speak.

29:00.826 --> 29:04.786
Agent Callen is it?

29:04.830 --> 29:06.832
You shouldn't be
talking to me.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.181
Hmm, relax.

29:08.224 --> 29:11.750
Everyone already knows
how fond I am of the help.

29:12.925 --> 29:15.971
I'll relax when we find out
who murdered your stepson.

29:16.015 --> 29:19.279
As I told Investigator Deeks,
you're wasting your time.

29:21.934 --> 29:24.066
It seems to me that
you should be

29:24.110 --> 29:25.241
more interested in helping us.

29:25.285 --> 29:27.853
Oh, please, don't pretend like

29:27.896 --> 29:29.115
you give a damn about him.

29:29.158 --> 29:31.073
All you care about is
finding those guns.

29:31.117 --> 29:32.814
The two aren't
mutually exclusive.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.167
I have found myself
in the company of

29:38.211 --> 29:39.734
some very dangerous people,

29:39.778 --> 29:41.692
Agent Callen, and if
those same people

29:41.736 --> 29:43.825
find out that
I brought you here,

29:43.869 --> 29:45.784
I'm as good as dead.

29:45.827 --> 29:48.438
I've helped you
as much as I can.

29:48.482 --> 29:51.964
And my apologies if I'd
rather spend my golden years

29:52.007 --> 29:56.098
in St. Tropez
instead of a casket.

30:05.412 --> 30:06.805
LAPD just finished
searching your office.

30:06.848 --> 30:08.763
They didn't find anything.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.199
- So I'm free to go?
- Sure.

30:10.243 --> 30:12.027
Grab some snacks on the way out.
They're vegetarian.

30:12.071 --> 30:14.029
Really?
No, not really.

30:14.073 --> 30:15.814
When I say they didn't
find anything,

30:15.857 --> 30:19.208
that includes computers,
furniture, not even a chair.

30:19.252 --> 30:20.819
Your office is a front.

30:20.862 --> 30:23.038
My line of work is
very mobile.

30:23.082 --> 30:25.084
Well, your life is about
to get real immobile.

30:25.127 --> 30:27.477
For how long depends
how much you help us.

30:27.521 --> 30:29.828
I didn't buy those guns.

30:29.871 --> 30:31.003
We think you were planning to.

30:31.046 --> 30:33.309
Planning isn't a crime.

30:33.353 --> 30:35.964
I assure you it is.

30:36.008 --> 30:38.140
Fine, I was in contact
with the seller,

30:38.184 --> 30:39.794
but I never met him.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.448
I was supposed to call him
when I had the money ready.

30:41.491 --> 30:43.319
And that's exactly what
you're gonna do.

30:43.363 --> 30:45.191
But I don't have
the money ready.

30:45.234 --> 30:46.975
That's okay.
We'll take care of that.

30:47.019 --> 30:48.368
Get the banking information.

30:48.411 --> 30:49.848
Tell 'em you're gonna wire
half up front,

30:49.891 --> 30:51.371
half when the deal's done.

30:51.414 --> 30:53.503
And get an address and tell 'em
you want to meet now.

30:53.547 --> 30:55.157
And if you say anything
to screw this up,

30:55.201 --> 30:56.898
we'll be sure to do
the same thing

30:56.942 --> 30:58.030
to the rest of your life.

30:59.248 --> 31:00.859
Make the call.

31:03.035 --> 31:05.298
What have we got?

31:05.341 --> 31:07.126
So we confirmed that the
insurance broker

31:07.169 --> 31:09.345
was in the process of
buying the missing weapons.

31:09.389 --> 31:10.999
Sam had him reach out
to the seller

31:11.043 --> 31:12.392
and get an address
for the meet.

31:12.435 --> 31:14.046
They're on their way
to check it out now.

31:14.089 --> 31:15.351
And is this the seller?

31:15.395 --> 31:17.527
To be determined.
That's Dominic Carson,

31:17.571 --> 31:20.269
and this is his
criminal record.

31:20.313 --> 31:22.924
Assault, theft, robbery.
The list goes on and on.

31:22.968 --> 31:25.884
Do we know where he was
the night the guns went missing?

31:25.927 --> 31:27.363
Still working on
tracking that down.

31:27.407 --> 31:29.017
What's his connection to Sivac?

31:29.061 --> 31:30.149
It's his stepbrother.

31:30.192 --> 31:32.847
Which also makes him
Miriam Sivac's son

31:32.891 --> 31:34.196
from her previous marriage.

31:35.719 --> 31:38.113
I'm guessing that she kept that
from us for a reason.

31:38.157 --> 31:39.941
Guessing you're right.

31:39.985 --> 31:43.205
Heads up,
Carson's on his way out.

31:43.249 --> 31:44.424
He's heading towards the front.

31:44.467 --> 31:46.252
Copy that.

31:50.952 --> 31:53.215
We might have a problem.

31:59.265 --> 32:00.396
Scratch that,
we definitely have a problem.

32:00.440 --> 32:01.876
We've been made.

32:03.095 --> 32:05.053
Hors d'oeuvres?

32:16.108 --> 32:17.065
Carson's on the move.

32:17.109 --> 32:18.545
Where's Deeks?

32:18.588 --> 32:20.547
I don't know but we gotta go.

32:23.245 --> 32:25.247
- Kens!
Damn it.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.449
Watch out!

33:16.385 --> 33:17.952
Agent Callen,

33:17.996 --> 33:20.911
care to tell me what the hell
is going on out there?

33:20.955 --> 33:23.262
- We have Carson.
- Great.

33:23.305 --> 33:26.352
We also have three of
his heavily armed friends.

33:26.395 --> 33:27.657
How far out are Sam
and Rountree?

33:29.355 --> 33:31.313
We're in the warehouse.

33:31.357 --> 33:33.011
Carson must be
a pretty popular dude.

33:33.054 --> 33:34.316
We got two if his homies here.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.927
Carson warned 'em.
They're packing up.

33:36.971 --> 33:38.146
You have a visual
on the guns?

33:38.190 --> 33:39.495
We got 'em.

33:39.539 --> 33:41.323
Then what are we waiting for,

33:41.367 --> 33:43.151
some kind of
divine intervention?

33:43.195 --> 33:44.544
That would be great.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.288
Don't turn around.

33:49.331 --> 33:51.159
I thought it smelled
like fish in here.

33:51.203 --> 33:52.421
I'm fine.
Thank you for asking.

33:52.465 --> 33:54.510
Why didn't you tell us
you were back there?

33:54.554 --> 33:55.685
Because I don't just
insert myself

33:55.729 --> 33:57.078
in other people's business.

33:57.122 --> 33:58.514
I don't mean to interrupt,

33:58.558 --> 34:00.081
but some of us have
a flight to catch.

34:00.125 --> 34:01.604
And some of us
still need to pack.

34:01.648 --> 34:02.649
And some of us

34:02.692 --> 34:04.346
would like to make it to Boca

34:04.390 --> 34:06.087
sometime this decade.

34:06.131 --> 34:08.394
Ladies and gentlemen,
take them down.

34:08.437 --> 34:10.091
How we gonna...

34:23.409 --> 34:25.237
Federal agents!

34:25.280 --> 34:27.195
Nope, down! Put it down!

34:29.023 --> 34:30.503
I don't think so.

34:32.374 --> 34:35.377
Good. I'm hot and sweaty.
I want to go home.

35:37.309 --> 35:39.137
Late again.

35:42.836 --> 35:44.620
Get up.

35:58.199 --> 36:00.549
I know you don't
want to be at home,

36:00.593 --> 36:03.291
but moving in here
is not an option.

36:03.335 --> 36:05.772
I was just tying up
a few loose ends.

36:05.815 --> 36:08.775
Well, Carson admitted
to killing Sivac

36:08.818 --> 36:10.516
and taking the guns,

36:10.559 --> 36:13.214
all of which have
been recovered.

36:13.258 --> 36:15.782
I think everything else can
wait until the morning.

36:15.825 --> 36:18.437
Hmm. Well, don't have
to tell me twice.

36:18.480 --> 36:21.396
Oh, there is just
one other thing.

36:21.440 --> 36:24.356
Um, I trust that you got the
phone number I just sent you?

36:24.399 --> 36:26.532
Yeah. Of course I did.

36:26.575 --> 36:29.665
You really do need to turn up
the volume on your alerts.

36:29.709 --> 36:32.320
Is it about a case?

36:32.364 --> 36:34.235
It's about a vacancy.

36:34.279 --> 36:36.759
I'm not sure I'm following.

36:36.803 --> 36:38.674
An old colleagueof mine

36:38.718 --> 36:42.591
owns a few apartment buildings
across the city.

36:42.635 --> 36:44.550
So many, in fact,
that the old bastard

36:44.593 --> 36:47.596
was able to retire
ten years before me.

36:47.640 --> 36:52.166
Admiral Kilbride, I...
I don't know what to say.

36:52.210 --> 36:55.735
Say you know me
when you talk to him.

36:58.259 --> 37:00.479
This doesn't make sense.

37:02.872 --> 37:05.266
I've always found it best
not to question

37:05.310 --> 37:07.834
my rare whims of generosity.

37:07.877 --> 37:10.532
Sorry, it's not that.
I was, um...

37:10.576 --> 37:12.491
I was closing out
the financials on the money

37:12.534 --> 37:14.580
that we temporarily wired
to Dominic Carson,

37:14.623 --> 37:16.321
and I asked FINCEN
to run a report

37:16.364 --> 37:19.367
on the shell company that
his bank account was linked to.

37:19.411 --> 37:20.760
But it turns out
it doesn't actually

37:20.803 --> 37:22.457
belong to Dominic Carson.

37:24.546 --> 37:26.940
Then who the hell
does it belong to?

37:30.335 --> 37:32.206
So you got sloppy.

37:32.250 --> 37:36.254
What can I say?
The martinis were doubles.

37:37.733 --> 37:39.735
Why'd you do it?

37:39.779 --> 37:41.737
You're the detective.

37:41.781 --> 37:43.696
Uh, correction.

37:43.739 --> 37:45.741
Actually, I'm an investigator.

37:45.785 --> 37:48.744
Just an investigator.

37:48.788 --> 37:50.398
And I actually love
the theater, but I'd prefer

37:50.442 --> 37:53.314
if you gave this performance.

37:56.796 --> 37:58.276
I'm not a monster.

37:59.712 --> 38:02.149
You had your stepson murdered.

38:02.192 --> 38:04.717
Well, he was trying
to cut Dominic and me out.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.414
What was I supposed to do?

38:06.458 --> 38:09.461
I don't know,
not have him murdered?

38:09.504 --> 38:13.465
We don't betray each other
in my family.

38:14.814 --> 38:17.599
Then you probably shouldn't
kill each other either.

38:17.643 --> 38:19.340
Hmm.

38:23.518 --> 38:27.305
I put 20 years of my life
into this business.

38:27.348 --> 38:29.307
Excuse me, family.

38:29.350 --> 38:32.788
I woke up with it
and I went to bed with it.

38:32.832 --> 38:36.618
I deserve every fruit
of its labor.

38:36.662 --> 38:39.621
I was not about to let
some spoiled, incompetent

38:39.665 --> 38:42.450
little brat determine
that I wasn't.

38:42.494 --> 38:44.583
So you didn't go to the bar
to convince Anders

38:44.626 --> 38:46.585
not to steal the weapons,
you went there with

38:46.628 --> 38:48.326
an ultimatum then, huh?

38:49.544 --> 38:51.285
You know, I'm not going
to say another word

38:51.329 --> 38:53.026
until I talk to my lawyer.

38:54.506 --> 38:55.811
Okay.

38:55.855 --> 38:59.032
That's all the questions
I have for today anyway.

39:02.557 --> 39:04.385
Actually, that's not true.
I got one more

39:04.429 --> 39:06.344
question for you.

39:06.387 --> 39:08.868
Did you kill that squirrel?

39:12.828 --> 39:17.442
That's okay, we can, uh,
save that for the trial.

39:21.446 --> 39:23.796
Come in.

39:23.839 --> 39:25.624
Didn't expect to hear
from you so soon.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.843
I didn't expect to
call you so soon.

39:27.887 --> 39:29.062
What made you
change your mind?

39:30.890 --> 39:33.371
You never asked me...
about my arrest.

39:33.414 --> 39:35.808
I didn't see the relevance.

39:37.984 --> 39:41.814
I stole files from the law
office I was working at.

39:41.857 --> 39:43.772
Not only was I arrested,

39:43.816 --> 39:46.558
I was disbarred.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.037
Luckily, I knew a good lawyer,

39:48.081 --> 39:50.692
or I'd be in jail, too.

39:50.736 --> 39:53.521
It was your first
and only offense,

39:53.565 --> 39:55.436
and it coincided with
your time with Katya.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.438
It's not hard to figure out
that she put you up to it.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.876
I don't trust anyone
anymore.

40:02.965 --> 40:06.404
But something about that
made me think I can trust you.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.842
You can.

40:16.892 --> 40:20.461
I hate who I was with her.

40:20.505 --> 40:23.072
But more than that,
I hate that I can't remember

40:23.116 --> 40:25.640
who I was before her.

40:29.557 --> 40:32.560
I want you to find her,
Agent Callen.

40:35.781 --> 40:37.435
You want me to
find him, too?

40:37.478 --> 40:38.523
Turn it over.

40:38.566 --> 40:41.482
It's to a safe-deposit box.

40:41.526 --> 40:44.529
I'm sorry, I
don't know where.

40:44.572 --> 40:46.922
Kate, or should
I say Katya,

40:46.966 --> 40:49.795
forgot that she
left it with me.

40:49.838 --> 40:51.492
I know it's not much, but...

40:51.536 --> 40:53.581
It's a start.

40:57.716 --> 40:59.848
That's me.

41:05.637 --> 41:06.768
Thank you.

41:26.527 --> 41:27.963
I didn't call an Uber.

41:29.182 --> 41:31.532
That's funny.
And we're late.

41:31.576 --> 41:33.403
That's fine.
I'm not checking a bag.

41:33.447 --> 41:34.535
You don't have a bag.

41:34.579 --> 41:35.580
If I need anything else,

41:35.623 --> 41:37.146
I'll buy it when
we get to D.C.

41:37.190 --> 41:38.757
How'd it go in there?

41:38.800 --> 41:40.454
Well, it's too soon to tell,

41:40.498 --> 41:42.891
but, uh...
I'm not holding my breath.

41:42.935 --> 41:44.110
Sometimes what we need the most

41:44.153 --> 41:46.068
comes from where
we expect the least.

41:46.112 --> 41:48.593
That's good. Is that
from your speech?

41:48.636 --> 41:50.072
I didn't write my speech yet.

41:50.116 --> 41:52.161
Oh. Great.

41:52.205 --> 41:55.513
We'll have lots of time
for me to help you.

41:55.556 --> 41:58.385
Now, uh, I think you should
start with a joke.

42:01.606 --> 42:03.825
That's funny.

42:03.869 --> 42:06.262
<i>Right?
I don't know.</i>

42:06.306 --> 42:08.221
<i>I'm serious.</i>
