WEBVTT

00:06.673 --> 00:07.632
Morning.

00:07.716 --> 00:09.592
- Come here.
- Yeah.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.346
Ew! Gross.
Get it out of my face.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.765
You have left this
sitting here for three days.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.435
Look at this disgusting
plate of grapes.

00:18.518 --> 00:21.146
Or, a delightful
dish of raisins.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.482
What would you do if
you lived by yourself?

00:24.566 --> 00:26.985
I'd open a raisin shop and
have boyfriends sleep over.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.990
Well, no boy wants to be
involved with a dirty girl.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.118
Okay, they all do.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.786
But you know what?
This is my office now

00:36.870 --> 00:39.539
and I really need you to start
picking up after yourself.

00:39.622 --> 00:42.333
- Is my room part of the office?
- No, of course not.

00:45.044 --> 00:46.713
Thank you.

00:48.214 --> 00:52.135
Hi. Sorry I am late, but I had
to race home this morning

00:52.218 --> 00:54.679
to change my clothes, if you
know what I'm saying.

00:54.763 --> 00:57.390
I do, so please stop.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.559
That's not what they said.

01:02.645 --> 01:04.730
So, who is ready for lattes?

01:04.813 --> 01:07.484
Here is the receipt.
To whom do I submit it?

01:07.567 --> 01:09.819
Lauren, my company
is 11 days old.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.322
- There is no expense account.
- Oh, no problemo.

01:12.405 --> 01:16.451
I'll just go take it out of
petty cash.

01:16.534 --> 01:19.496
No! Unh-unh. My wallet
is not petty cash.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.498
Yeah, you got that right.

01:21.581 --> 01:25.335
Ooh, nice picture. Weight, 102?

01:25.418 --> 01:29.172
Oh, my God, we weigh
the exact same!

01:29.255 --> 01:31.508
You girls look all fancy.
What's up?

01:31.591 --> 01:33.927
Well, it's a big day for us.
We are meeting with

01:34.010 --> 01:37.013
what I'm hoping will
be Val-Co's next client.

01:37.096 --> 01:38.515
- Val-Co?
- Yeah.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.809
I finally thought of a
great name for the company.

01:40.892 --> 01:43.436
What is it?

01:43.520 --> 01:45.605
You'll like it when you
see it with the logo.

01:45.688 --> 01:49.692
Why? Does it cover
up the name Val-Co?

01:49.776 --> 01:51.861
So, did Dr. Haven finally
return our phone calls?

01:51.945 --> 01:54.113
No, she didn't, but she is
having a book-signing

01:54.197 --> 01:57.700
at Tribeca Books today,
and we are going to go to her.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.869
"Taming your Teen"?
Have you read this?

01:59.953 --> 02:03.540
Oh, God, no. Parenting
books are a total scam.

02:03.623 --> 02:08.461
My mom never read one,
and look at me.

02:08.544 --> 02:12.632
Listen to this. "Like toddlers,
teenagers subconsciously

02:12.715 --> 02:14.717
"want boundaries.
It's up to parents

02:14.801 --> 02:16.719
"to strap their teens
into what I call

02:16.803 --> 02:19.806
the invisible stroller."

02:19.889 --> 02:23.268
Did you ever want to strap me
into an invisible stroller?

02:23.351 --> 02:25.395
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.188
We go to the book signing,
start up a little

02:27.272 --> 02:30.066
conversation with Dr. Haven,
invite her to coffee

02:30.149 --> 02:32.068
and then I pitch
the company to her.

02:32.151 --> 02:33.862
Is the coffee to keep her awake?
'Cause..

02:33.945 --> 02:36.155
[snores]

02:36.239 --> 02:37.740
Okay, I've only been doing this

02:37.824 --> 02:41.369
since you were french-kissing
your hand.

02:41.452 --> 02:42.954
What do you have?

02:43.037 --> 02:46.958
Okay, let's see.
What can we learn about Judy?

02:47.041 --> 02:50.253
Okay, well, it says here
she's been divorced.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.380
Clearly, she needs a makeover.

02:52.463 --> 02:54.591
Um, so why don't
we take her to a spa

02:54.674 --> 02:55.842
get her all glammed up?

02:55.925 --> 02:57.427
She can maybe meet a sexy
fireman

02:57.510 --> 03:00.430
and it'll be all thanks to us.
How could she not want to sign?

03:00.513 --> 03:02.932
Okay, so you're saying we spend
a bunch of money

03:03.016 --> 03:06.185
that we don't have to make her
feel ugly and alone.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.604
Yeah, if she doesn't
sign right then

03:07.687 --> 03:09.314
I am quittin' the business.

03:09.397 --> 03:10.982
You're, you're kidding, right?

03:11.065 --> 03:13.735
'Cause if you quit, then I'm
back out on the streets.

03:13.818 --> 03:16.237
Oh, God!

03:16.321 --> 03:19.616
- My staff.
- Okay, look, calm down!

03:19.699 --> 03:21.534
If you don't like that idea,
there's a million more

03:21.618 --> 03:22.952
where that came from.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.621
Unfortunately, you have
to go to school.

03:24.704 --> 03:27.624
Who needs school?
I'm like a P.R. genius.

03:27.707 --> 03:28.625
Okay, what about this?

03:28.708 --> 03:29.792
- No, no, go.
- How..

03:29.876 --> 03:31.294
- You're gonna be late.
- Val.

03:31.377 --> 03:32.837
I thought you said that
when you started a company

03:32.921 --> 03:34.172
you would want me to help.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.299
I did, I did, and when I get
this client

03:36.382 --> 03:39.510
I will start a file,
and you can file it.

03:39.594 --> 03:42.055
Now, go to school.
Brush up on that alphabet

03:42.138 --> 03:43.806
so you can file it real good.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.851
This is so lame. I hate Val-Co.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.938
Yeah, at Laurenco,
we'd be drinkin' by now.

[instrumental music]

[instrumental music]

04:36.234 --> 04:37.443
Hey, girls.

04:37.527 --> 04:38.903
- Hey.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

04:38.987 --> 04:40.905
- I'm on my lunch break.
- It's 11:00.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.240
I meant I'm skipping chemistry.

04:42.323 --> 04:44.158
Can you write me a note?

04:44.242 --> 04:45.827
Yes, because I finished school.

04:47.161 --> 04:48.997
Look, I'm sorry, but
after I thought about

04:49.080 --> 04:50.665
your whole taking
her out to coffee thing

04:50.748 --> 04:53.042
I got a little freaked
out about my future.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.545
I've got dreams, Val.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.047
Is one of them to
not go to college?

04:58.131 --> 05:00.174
Look, I'll stay out
of your way, okay?

05:00.258 --> 05:02.385
You do your thing.
I'm just here for backup.

05:02.468 --> 05:03.720
Alright.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.847
- Oh, my God, there's Peter!
- What? Where?

05:05.930 --> 05:07.056
What is he doing here?

05:07.140 --> 05:08.349
What do you think
he's doing here?

05:08.433 --> 05:10.393
He wants to sign
her account, too.

05:10.476 --> 05:11.394
Hey, guys.

05:11.477 --> 05:12.687
- Hello.
- Hi.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.897
So, big Judith Haven fan,
are you?

05:14.981 --> 05:16.482
Nah. I mean, I
haven't even read it.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.192
I'm just here to sign her.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.737
Well, I'm sorry, but I think
you're a little too late.

05:20.820 --> 05:21.738
Meaning?

05:21.821 --> 05:23.281
Meaning, uh, I got here first

05:23.364 --> 05:25.992
and the back of the
line's over there, buddy.

05:26.075 --> 05:28.870
Way to go PG-13 on him.

05:28.953 --> 05:31.664
- Hey, you.
- Hey, Judy.

05:31.748 --> 05:35.084
Is there anything you'd
like me to tell her?

05:35.168 --> 05:36.586
Did he just call her Judy?

05:36.669 --> 05:39.130
And did you hear that
"Hey, you"?

05:39.213 --> 05:41.007
They are doin' it!

05:41.090 --> 05:42.550
It doesn't mean
they're doing it.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.677
Oh, yeah? Well, I've had more
than a few guys

05:44.761 --> 05:46.804
give me the old "Hey, you."

05:46.888 --> 05:49.599
Did it ever occur to you that's
because they forgot your name?

05:49.682 --> 05:50.808
Okay, what do you want me to do?

05:50.892 --> 05:52.351
Ooh, I could set
something on fire

05:52.435 --> 05:55.438
or I could steal something
and set off the alarm.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.565
That's real mature.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.152
- Alright
- Alright, I'm taking cutsies.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.654
Come on. Excuse me. I'm sorry.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.531
[laughing]

06:06.449 --> 06:08.618
Uh...Judy, this is Val Tyler.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.454
Val used to work with
me at Harper &amp; Diggs.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.748
Yes, I left to
form my own agency.

06:13.831 --> 06:15.750
You know,
a small boutique agency

06:15.833 --> 06:17.835
just a few select clients.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.463
Yeah, we were very
sorry to lose her.

06:20.546 --> 06:23.800
How many clients
do you have right now?

06:23.883 --> 06:26.094
A hundred.

06:26.177 --> 06:28.387
So, Peter, how'd you like
Judith's book?

06:28.471 --> 06:30.223
- I loved it.
- Oh, yeah?

06:30.306 --> 06:31.891
What was your favorite part?

06:31.974 --> 06:34.352
Her picture.

06:34.435 --> 06:35.686
Uh, which reminds me you know

06:35.770 --> 06:37.855
I forgot to have
mine signed last night.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.482
Maybe one too many martinis.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.984
Still drinkin', huh?

06:42.068 --> 06:47.490
Uh, well, I have to. Attractive
women make me nervous.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.575
Why don't you
leave it right here?

06:49.659 --> 06:51.494
There's a publishing
party this evening

06:51.577 --> 06:53.496
and I'll give it
back to you there.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.664
Give me a chance to write
something

06:54.747 --> 06:55.748
a little more personal.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.668
Alright. I'll stop by.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.795
Thank you.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.589
Dr. Haven, I know
you're very busy

07:03.673 --> 07:05.133
but I would love to sit down
with you

07:05.216 --> 07:06.634
maybe have coffee, and discuss..

07:06.717 --> 07:10.513
Oh, I am sorry. I am
completely overscheduled.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.306
Um, Dr. Haven, you know what

07:12.390 --> 07:14.183
my sister liked
most about your book?

07:14.267 --> 07:15.852
It's the fact that you have a
17-year-old daughter

07:15.935 --> 07:19.689
and Val has a 17-year-old sister
living with her...me.

07:19.772 --> 07:20.940
Total relatability.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.693
Oh, well, did you find the book
helpful?

07:23.776 --> 07:28.531
So helpful. "Never too old for a
time-out", how true is that?

07:28.614 --> 07:30.741
- What school do you go to?
- Stuyvesant.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.702
That's where my daughter
just started.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.496
Shut up!

07:35.580 --> 07:37.039
They should meet.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.542
Absolutely. Tina doesn't know
anybody yet.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.210
Well, then this is perfect.
She'll know Holly.

07:41.294 --> 07:44.338
Holly's great.
Everybody loves Holly.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.882
What are you doing this
afternoon?

07:45.965 --> 07:49.051
Oh...oh, shoot.
I have Bible study class.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.053
Well, you know what?
I could put that off.

07:51.137 --> 07:54.724
Yeah, yeah, we can study up on
some Scripture later at home.

07:54.807 --> 07:58.895
Well, great. Why don't you come
by the book party this evening

07:58.978 --> 08:00.813
and we can compare
notes on our girls.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.399
Oh, I'd love to.
See you there.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.571
Oh, nicely done.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.489
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.742
You know, when I sign her,
I'm gonna have to take you

08:12.825 --> 08:14.368
to a very expensive dinner.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.245
No, I think I'll be the one
taking you

08:16.329 --> 08:17.538
to the expensive dinner.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.041
Okay, when I sign her,
you can take me.

08:22.501 --> 08:25.713
- You were amazing.
- Hey, I know him.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.590
Hi, Paul.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.717
Hey...you.

08:40.811 --> 08:43.063
Hey, so after what you did today
you're probably gonna have this

08:43.147 --> 08:44.524
big position in Val's
company, huh?

08:44.607 --> 08:45.983
Oh, yeah.
Office buzz is she's going

08:46.067 --> 08:47.526
to make me a vice president.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.112
- In charge of what?
- I don't know.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.949
- Hey, can I be in the company?
- Sure, you're treasurer.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.743
You can buy my lunch.
Now, listen.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.578
This Tina girl was
raised really strict

08:57.662 --> 08:59.455
so I'm thinking she's
gonna be like a pilgrim girl.

08:59.538 --> 09:01.374
So that means we have to act
like pilgrims, too.

09:01.457 --> 09:02.833
No, Holly,
there were no black pilgrims.

09:02.917 --> 09:06.629
You gotta stop skippin' school.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.589
- Hey, are you Holly?
- Oh, hi.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.675
- Yeah, are you Tina?
- Yeah.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.843
Okay, uh, well, this is Gary.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.470
Is it okay
if he hangs out with us?

09:14.553 --> 09:19.308
I don't care. Scoot.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.520
So...you go to Stuyvesant, too?

09:22.603 --> 09:24.272
I'm only here because
my mom made me come

09:24.355 --> 09:26.065
and you're only here
because your sister

09:26.148 --> 09:27.984
wants my mom's business,
so here's what happened..

09:28.067 --> 09:32.822
We met. We shopped. We shared
a giant cookie. It was great.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.992
Hey, what kind of cookie?
Chocolate chip, oatmeal?

09:36.075 --> 09:37.827
Y'all got to be on
the same page cookie-wise

09:37.910 --> 09:40.997
or your whole plan's
going to crumble.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.790
Cookie, crumble?

09:42.873 --> 09:45.334
Cookie, crumble..

09:45.418 --> 09:47.712
- Who are you?
- Gary.

09:48.963 --> 09:49.922
He your boyfriend?

09:50.006 --> 09:51.173
- No.
- No.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.675
- Hey!
- Hey!

09:52.758 --> 09:55.219
Whatever. God, I just...I hate
it when my mom

09:55.303 --> 09:57.972
sets me up on play dates. You
know, I can find my own friends.

09:58.055 --> 09:59.682
Good, go find them.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.892
- Gary!
- Oh, don't worry about it.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.353
Sometimes I come off mean.
It's this whole anger thing

10:04.437 --> 10:05.563
I've got going on.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.481
Why, did you read
your mom's book?

10:07.565 --> 10:10.943
How gross is that thing? I mean,
how can I not be hostile?

10:11.027 --> 10:12.820
Alright, since we all know
what's going on here

10:12.903 --> 10:15.364
and obviously you don't want to
be here, then do me a favor

10:15.448 --> 10:17.116
and put in a good
word for my sister?

10:17.199 --> 10:20.202
Fine. I'll see you.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.704
Oh, my God, she is unbelievable.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.331
- What?
- My mom's checking up on me.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.750
Here, hide this.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.543
- Oh, hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

10:27.626 --> 10:28.961
I was just passing by.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.629
Thought I'd stop in,
see how things are going.

10:30.713 --> 10:34.050
So great. Oh, thank you so much
for hooking me up with Holly.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.551
She is so nice.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.845
Well, I thought
you two might get along.

10:37.928 --> 10:39.722
What's in the bag?

10:39.805 --> 10:41.182
What bag?

10:41.265 --> 10:42.975
The bag you just
handed to Holly.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.019
Oh, yeah, it's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.271
Tina, I'd like to see
what's in the bag.

10:57.239 --> 10:58.824
A pregnancy test? Get up.

10:58.908 --> 11:04.747
- No, Mom..
- Now!

11:04.830 --> 11:09.377
It's mine.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.587
But it's not mine.

11:14.090 --> 11:18.928
Well, we have to be going.
Good luck with...everything.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.554
Let's go.

11:20.638 --> 11:23.724
Mom, I think I should stay.
Holly's kind of freaked, and..

11:23.808 --> 11:27.269
Tina, she is not an appropriate
friend, okay? Let's go.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.021
No, come on, look,
doesn't your book say

11:29.105 --> 11:33.192
that after parents, peers are
the best support system?

11:33.275 --> 11:36.195
Alright. But I don't want you
hanging around here long.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.489
Okay. Thanks.
I'll see you later.

11:40.991 --> 11:42.993
Thanks.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.582
Why did you do that?
You just met that girl.

11:48.666 --> 11:51.293
I don't know about you, but I
found her a bit impolite.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.964
Did you see her face?
She was scared to death.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.383
And, oh, my God, her mom?
Can you believe her?

11:57.466 --> 12:00.970
Yeah. She's gonna make one
wicked-ass grandma.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.805
- Where you going?
- To the bathroom.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.057
I gotta go find out
if I'm pregnant.

12:14.483 --> 12:16.861
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

12:16.944 --> 12:17.987
Hey, look,
as long as you're here

12:18.070 --> 12:19.238
you mind guarding the door?

12:19.321 --> 12:23.325
Oh, sure, no problem.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.661
So, how long does the test take?

12:25.744 --> 12:28.122
The box says three minutes.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.376
Hey, look, just so you know,
I'm not a slut, okay?

12:32.460 --> 12:34.211
Oh, I didn't think you were.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.672
Probably a little looser than I
should be, but..

12:36.755 --> 12:38.549
Probably.

12:38.632 --> 12:41.010
God, this is the longest
three minutes of my life.

12:41.093 --> 12:45.389
Okay, so, uh, let's talk. Tell
me something about yourself.

12:45.473 --> 12:48.726
Um...I think I might be
pregnant.

12:48.809 --> 12:52.229
Okay, um, so where, uh..
Where are you from?

12:52.313 --> 12:54.523
Chicago, where I wasn't
pregnant.

12:54.607 --> 12:58.527
Oh. Okay, let's talk about me.
Um, ask me anything.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.863
Have you ever been pregnant?

13:00.946 --> 13:02.198
- Hold on a minute.
- It's me, it's me.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.449
I need to talk to you
for a second.

13:03.532 --> 13:04.700
Okay.

13:04.783 --> 13:06.410
Sorry for interrupting the
proceedings

13:06.494 --> 13:08.996
but, um,
I'm $4 short on the bill.

13:09.079 --> 13:11.207
Sorry, one second.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.458
Okay, here you go.

13:12.541 --> 13:15.377
I'd kind of like
to leave a nice tip.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.714
- Oh, my God.
- I know. Get out of here.

13:18.797 --> 13:20.841
No. No, no.
The stick...it's pink.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.718
Ooh, is she having a girl?

13:22.801 --> 13:25.012
No. No, no. It means that
I'm not pregnant.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.680
Oh, my God, you're not pregnant!

13:26.764 --> 13:29.850
- Oh, my God, I'm not pregnant!
- Oh, congratulations.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.268
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.896
- For what?
- I'm never having sex.

13:33.979 --> 13:37.399
Me neither.
Well, you know, not a ton.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.860
Take it easy, okay? Maybe I'll
see you around school.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.737
Thank you. Hey, I owe you.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.615
No, you don't. Just put in a
good word for my sister, okay?

13:44.698 --> 13:46.617
You got a second choice?

13:46.700 --> 13:48.160
What do you mean?

13:48.244 --> 13:49.870
Look, trust me, the minute that
my mom saw you with

13:49.954 --> 13:52.748
that pregnancy test. She totally
wrote off you and your sister.

13:52.831 --> 13:55.042
Oh, my God. Okay,
I have to go tell Val.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.085
Do you know where that party is?

13:56.168 --> 13:58.462
Oh, yeah. I'll go with you.

13:58.546 --> 14:03.050
- Here, get rid of this for me.
- Okay.

14:03.133 --> 14:04.760
Ew!

14:15.145 --> 14:16.939
Look at Peter sucking up to her.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.857
He's trying to make up
for his lack of ideas

14:18.941 --> 14:21.277
with food,
alcohol, and dimples.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.655
Mm. How good does he look
a-walkin'?

14:26.907 --> 14:28.951
How many of those have you had?

14:29.034 --> 14:30.536
Two..

14:30.619 --> 14:33.455
...less than seven.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.457
[Judith and Peter laughing]

14:36.292 --> 14:37.710
He is disgusting.

14:37.793 --> 14:42.798
Don't you worry about
that gorgeous, funny man.

14:42.881 --> 14:45.467
Oh, look, here comes your little
ace in the hole.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.846
Okay, listen to me. You go stick
to Peter like glue

14:48.929 --> 14:51.432
until we have signed her, okay?
Do you hear me?

14:51.515 --> 14:55.019
I'm smashed, not deaf.

14:55.102 --> 14:56.895
- Hey.
- Hi. There you are.

14:56.979 --> 15:01.358
Oh, this must be Tina.
Hi. It is so nice to meet you.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.027
Oh, you guys look so cute
together.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.237
You got that whole chemistry
thing happening.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.031
Hey, you should come over and
hang out at our place.

15:07.114 --> 15:08.782
You wanna come over tonight?

15:08.866 --> 15:12.161
Um, I'd better go. I can't let
my mom see me with you.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.163
Why? Why? Why can't she be seen
with you?

15:14.246 --> 15:15.664
Oh, Holly, did you curse at her?

15:15.748 --> 15:19.043
No. Her mom kind of thinks that
I might be pregnant.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.961
- What?
- No, I'm not.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.088
But Tina thought she might be,
and her mom caught her

15:23.172 --> 15:25.549
with a pregnancy test,
and so I said it was mine.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.051
Why? Why would you do that?

15:27.134 --> 15:30.012
Because her mom is a scary,
scary monster

15:30.095 --> 15:32.056
and I just thought
if I said the test was mine

15:32.139 --> 15:33.974
then what's the difference?

15:34.058 --> 15:36.393
Wow. That's a really incredible
thing to do.

15:36.477 --> 15:39.355
Yeah, but now the monster
thinks I'm a ho

15:39.438 --> 15:41.523
which means that you're the
guardian of a ho

15:41.607 --> 15:44.151
which means that we don't get
her business. I'm sorry.

15:44.234 --> 15:47.655
No, it's okay. It's okay.
I can still fix this.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.325
Ooh, I know what to do.
Come with me.

15:51.408 --> 15:52.451
Why do I have to go?

15:52.534 --> 15:53.994
Because I need you
to stand nearby

15:54.078 --> 15:56.038
and look sad and troubled.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.165
[gasps]
Sushi.

15:59.291 --> 16:02.252
- Oh. Hello, Val.
- Hi, Judith.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.046
You alright?

16:04.129 --> 16:09.635
Oh, I don't know. I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know.

16:09.718 --> 16:12.096
I just am so confused.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.931
Can I.. No.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.557
What?

16:15.641 --> 16:17.893
Well, it's just that I could
really use

16:17.976 --> 16:21.980
some of your expert advice
on that one over there.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.200
Oh.

16:33.283 --> 16:34.993
Do you really
want to know what I think?

16:35.077 --> 16:37.329
Oh, yeah. I don't know where
else to turn.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.874
I mean, how did she
get so out of control?

16:40.958 --> 16:43.669
- It's you.
- I'm sorry?

16:43.752 --> 16:47.506
- May I speak freely?
- More freely than that?

16:47.589 --> 16:51.343
It's Holly's environment.
She lives with you, right?

16:51.427 --> 16:52.678
And it's just the two of you?

16:52.761 --> 16:54.179
- Yeah.
- So.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.931
There's really no traditional
parental figure

16:56.014 --> 16:57.433
for her to look up to.

16:57.516 --> 17:02.020
There are no boundaries, no
invisible stroller, if you will.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.772
She obviously has no structure,
no rules.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.276
There's really no parenting
going on.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.444
At best, you're a substitute.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.116
I do the best I can.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.993
Oh, well, I'm sure you do.
But look, you're very young.

17:17.077 --> 17:19.579
You've got your own life,
your own friends.

17:19.663 --> 17:21.707
This is your time to be selfish.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.291
It is?

17:23.375 --> 17:25.711
- But you can't.
- No, I can't.

17:25.794 --> 17:27.628
Because?

17:27.713 --> 17:30.048
Because I have
a teen in the house.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.926
That's right.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.637
And you also have a new business
in the house, don't you?

17:35.721 --> 17:37.639
Yes, Doctor.

17:37.723 --> 17:40.809
And I'd imagine
you're consumed by it.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.271
- Ooh, you're good.
- I know.

17:44.354 --> 17:47.024
So, perhaps Holly
really isn't a priority.

17:47.107 --> 17:50.569
Then, you see, the questions
isn't "what's wrong with Holly?"

17:50.652 --> 17:53.989
the question is,
"what's wrong with you?"

17:54.072 --> 17:57.743
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa! Hold up there, Judy.

17:57.826 --> 18:00.454
Val, you're not listening
to this garbage, are you?

18:00.537 --> 18:02.498
Well, she is a doctor.

18:02.581 --> 18:06.293
No, no. Okay, look...I know that
you're an expert

18:06.376 --> 18:08.212
but, oh, my God,
what were you smoking

18:08.295 --> 18:09.630
when you wrote this book?

18:09.713 --> 18:11.840
Okay. Holly, I don't think..

18:11.924 --> 18:14.092
No, no, no. It's quite alright.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.345
I like getting feedback from
young people.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.388
Oh, okay, good, 'cause here's
some feedback.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.141
I am so glad that
you're not my mom

18:21.225 --> 18:22.851
because if you were,
I would have been

18:22.935 --> 18:26.730
in some gross diner bathroom all
by myself, scared to death

18:26.814 --> 18:31.193
taking a pregnancy test. But
instead, I had somebody to go to

18:31.276 --> 18:34.363
this woman, the one who you say
is a horrible guardian.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.698
Well, you know what? I didn't
have to hide it from her.

18:36.782 --> 18:40.035
I mean, she wasn't happy.
Believe me, so not happy.

18:40.118 --> 18:42.204
But she was there for me.

18:42.287 --> 18:45.332
So when I hear you say that my
sister's not doing a good job

18:45.415 --> 18:47.459
and that I'm not a priority,
well, you know what?

18:47.543 --> 18:49.795
It makes me want to tell you
to write a book about

18:49.878 --> 18:53.382
pissing me off because you're
totally an expert at that!

18:57.469 --> 19:01.765
Well, you certainly have your
hands full.

19:01.849 --> 19:07.437
I know. I know, I know, I know.

19:07.521 --> 19:11.483
Hey, when you invited me over
tonight, did you mean forever?

19:11.567 --> 19:12.568
You can stay
as long as you want

19:12.651 --> 19:14.987
but mommy can never visit.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.447
- I'll call you, okay?
- Okay, thanks.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.909
Val, I'm sorry
about losing the client.

19:20.993 --> 19:24.580
It's okay. It was worth it
to hear how awesome I am.

19:24.663 --> 19:27.165
- You are awesome.
- And you are smart.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.210
It takes a smart girl
to know how awesome I am.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.338
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:33.422 --> 19:36.508
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah, I'm awesome.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.635
Uh, Dr. Haven, all yours.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.430
Oh, well, if it makes you feel
any better

19:41.513 --> 19:43.015
I don't want her, either.

19:43.098 --> 19:45.934
I'm gonna sign her,
but I don't want her.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.271
It looks like I owe you
a very expensive dinner.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.607
No, I don't think so.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.692
Oh, that's too bad.
I was going to try

19:53.775 --> 19:55.777
and talk you into coming
back to work for me.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.155
