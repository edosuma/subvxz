"Project Runaway"
Closed Captioned

00:02.085 --> 00:03.504
ANNIE:
Previously on 90210...

00:03.545 --> 00:05.673
Congressional candidate
Charles Sanderson's nephew

00:05.714 --> 00:10.010
Teddy Montgomery could be seen
participating in a gay wedding.

00:10.051 --> 00:12.888
SILVER:
I somehow sent the video to the
campaign office by accident.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.055
Please forgive me.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.308
I don't know if I can.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.059
Titus Cologne; it's
a two-year contract.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.520
It would be really good
for your career.

00:19.561 --> 00:20.646
Sign me up.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.147
SHEILA:
You broke your leg

00:22.189 --> 00:26.109
and your contract,
so unless you've got 200 grand

00:26.151 --> 00:27.820
lying around someplace,
I'm afraid you are

00:27.862 --> 00:30.030
not going anywhere.

00:30.071 --> 00:31.615
You knew my grandmother
was suicidal.

00:31.657 --> 00:32.783
You're responsible
for her death,

00:32.825 --> 00:33.993
and I'm gonna make sure
you don't get

00:34.034 --> 00:36.286
a penny of the
inheritance.

00:36.328 --> 00:38.664
Thank you for asking me to
co-chair the party with you.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.000
You were right-- it was a
perfect opportunity for revenge.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.793
I hope you know this isn't over.

00:42.835 --> 00:44.545
Actually, I think it is.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.380
I don't have any proof
of the stolen cars, okay?

00:46.421 --> 00:47.464
Work with the police to get
the evidence we need.

00:47.506 --> 00:50.009
My contact is here.

00:55.138 --> 00:57.182
DIXON:
You're the only person
that really knows

00:57.224 --> 00:58.851
what I'm going through.
Like, I need you.

00:58.893 --> 01:01.144
What you need is to be able
to tell the truth.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.564
Uh, guys, I have
something I gotta say.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.607
I'm a drug addict.

01:08.861 --> 01:10.988
(Adrianna sighs)

01:13.657 --> 01:15.659
(chuckles)

01:15.701 --> 01:18.161
You snore.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.039
And it's cute.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.874
(both laugh)

01:21.916 --> 01:23.542
Well, you steal covers

01:23.584 --> 01:27.254
like a starving person
who eats covers.

01:27.295 --> 01:28.630
(chuckles)
I'm sorry.

01:28.672 --> 01:31.216
No, no, it's fine.

01:31.258 --> 01:34.093
I haven't slept this
good in months.

01:34.135 --> 01:36.263
It's, like, rehab
is done, and...

01:36.304 --> 01:40.350
my mind is clear now,
and I got you.

01:40.392 --> 01:43.478
I swear, my future's,
like, so bright,

01:43.520 --> 01:44.772
I need to get those
humongous

01:44.813 --> 01:46.732
old people sunglasses,
you know?

01:46.774 --> 01:48.025
(both laugh)

01:48.067 --> 01:52.487
Yeah, rehab can really take
you out of the real world.

01:52.529 --> 01:56.075
You never know when
temptation's gonna hit.

01:56.116 --> 01:59.661
But lucky for you,
Mm-hmm.

01:59.703 --> 02:02.497
you got me.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.207
I'm gonna be there
every step of the way.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.961
I like the way that sounds.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.264
MAN:
Dixon!

02:19.306 --> 02:21.100
You home?!

02:21.141 --> 02:22.476
Big D!

02:22.517 --> 02:23.811
(laughs)

02:23.852 --> 02:24.728
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

02:25.437 --> 02:28.023
(laughing)

02:28.065 --> 02:30.317
J.D., what-what
are you doing here?

02:30.358 --> 02:32.527
I just got released!

02:32.569 --> 02:34.529
Released from jail?

02:34.571 --> 02:38.826
No, no, uh, J.D. was my roommate
in, uh, rehab.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.787
And also, the legendary drummer
from The Loathsome Hydrangeas.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.413
Guilty as charged.

02:43.455 --> 02:46.750
So, Big D, you ready to
start talking music?!

02:46.792 --> 02:48.669
(laughs)

02:50.963 --> 02:53.507
(man and woman speaking Spanish
on TV)

02:59.805 --> 03:00.848
Ah!

03:00.889 --> 03:03.058
Come on!

03:03.100 --> 03:04.392
Ugh! I'm allergic
to sunlight.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.979
Tough. I'm staging
a "friendtervention."

03:07.021 --> 03:08.897
Rocky road?
Okay, first step,

03:08.939 --> 03:10.524
stop eating metaphors.

03:10.565 --> 03:13.401
Silver...

03:13.443 --> 03:15.570
Teddy will eventually
forgive you,

03:15.612 --> 03:17.156
and Navid broke things
off with you weeks ago.

03:17.196 --> 03:18.740
So it's time to get

03:18.782 --> 03:21.200
a little extra credit with that
professor guy of yours.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.661
Ivy, sweetie,

03:22.703 --> 03:25.039
Raj is going to live,
so stop acting like he's dead.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.247
He's merely an ex.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.249
Yeah, an ex-husband.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.627
Ugh! God, you guys,
that sounds so old and gross.

03:30.669 --> 03:33.421
Yeah, so stop dwelling on it,
go to New Guinea

03:33.463 --> 03:36.133
and welcome that cute photo guy
into your jungle!

03:36.175 --> 03:37.968
And, Annie, I have no idea what
the hell your problem is.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.720
You dumped that cheating
dirtbag Patrick,

03:39.761 --> 03:41.722
and now you're ungodly rich
with Marla's money.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.724
What?

03:43.765 --> 03:45.517
I told you about the
inheritance in confidence.

03:45.559 --> 03:48.353
Why would you keep that
from your friends?

03:48.395 --> 03:50.189
Yeah, it's not like Silver
broadcast it on

03:50.271 --> 03:52.149
the evening news.
Too soon?

03:52.191 --> 03:54.109
Yeah.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.694
Okay, anyway, you're loaded,

03:55.736 --> 03:57.362
so stop acting
like poor Little Orphan Annie.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.488
And it wouldn't kill you

03:58.530 --> 04:00.323
to pitch in with some rent
once in a while.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.324
Rent?

04:01.366 --> 04:03.410
Yes, rent.

04:03.451 --> 04:07.581
If you can afford to send Dixon
to a spa retreat/rehab vacay,

04:07.622 --> 04:09.708
I think you can
afford to, you know,

04:09.750 --> 04:10.876
contribute a little to
the house party fund.

04:10.918 --> 04:14.421
Look, I'm sorry to be such
a motivational Molly,

04:14.462 --> 04:17.091
but it's just that I have
really, really good news

04:17.132 --> 04:18.507
and I need happy faces.

04:18.550 --> 04:21.136
I've always been top of the food
chain socially, I know,

04:21.178 --> 04:24.014
now I want to do so
professionally.

04:24.056 --> 04:26.767
I got my acceptance letter.

04:26.808 --> 04:29.436
You want to be
a fashion designer?

04:29.477 --> 04:31.063
I know. It's perfect, right?

04:31.105 --> 04:33.732
I love clothes, and
People say, "Do what you love."

04:33.774 --> 04:35.316
Girls, seriously, look out.

04:35.358 --> 04:38.528
Before you know it, everyone is
gonna be wearing Naomi Clark!

04:42.074 --> 04:43.658
Hi.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.826
Whoa, that was fast.

04:44.868 --> 04:46.078
Your text seemed urgent.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.871
That extra exclamation point
gets me every time.

04:47.913 --> 04:50.582
I overheard my uncle
talk about a shipment

04:50.624 --> 04:51.875
of 25 cars coming
through the studio.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.377
This could be the deal
we've been waiting for.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.588
Okay, slow down.
I need details.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.923
What's the name
of the buyer?

04:57.965 --> 04:59.049
I didn't catch anything else,

04:59.091 --> 05:00.467
but it's
happening soon.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.510
And when it does,
I'll tag along wearing a wire.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.139
We could bust him
when the deal goes down, right?

05:05.180 --> 05:09.143
You want to tag along on a
felony sale of stolen vehicles

05:09.184 --> 05:10.685
to an unknown party,

05:10.727 --> 05:13.814
no intel on the location or
who we're dealing with

05:13.855 --> 05:16.108
and no plan for backup?

05:16.150 --> 05:18.401
You're using cop-talk to make
this plan sound so dumb.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.988
It is a dumb plan!
It's entirely too dangerous.

05:21.029 --> 05:25.242
Kat, I just... I want this
all to be over, okay?

05:25.284 --> 05:28.369
Just so I can go on and live
my normal life.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.913
Don't you get it?

05:29.955 --> 05:34.168
I do, okay? But it's my job
to keep you safe. I mean,

05:34.209 --> 05:35.376
if something
happened to you...

05:40.715 --> 05:42.592
Look, Navid, we
have been working

05:42.634 --> 05:47.264
to build an ironclad case
against Amal so we can put him

05:47.306 --> 05:48.515
behind bars for good.

05:48.556 --> 05:52.019
I'm just asking you
to be patient

05:52.060 --> 05:53.561
for a little while longer.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.606
Okay.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.327
Oh, yeah.

06:08.367 --> 06:10.287
Yes. All right.
(chuckles)

06:10.329 --> 06:12.122
Vampires on the beach, huh?
Uh-huh.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.457
What are we advertising?
Advertising?

06:14.499 --> 06:16.960
No, I hired you for my
daughter's birthday party.

06:17.002 --> 06:19.963
Wait. This isn't a photo shoot?

06:20.005 --> 06:21.756
No. Look,
my baby loves two things:

06:21.798 --> 06:24.301
the Vampire Diaries
and your billboards.

06:24.343 --> 06:26.094
So I got creative
and combined the two.

06:26.136 --> 06:26.928
(girls screaming happily)

06:26.970 --> 06:29.514
Bite me.

06:29.556 --> 06:32.351
Whoa! Whoa!
Wait a minute! Whoa!

06:32.391 --> 06:36.230
Okay, I didn't, I didn't know!

06:50.618 --> 06:51.870
I'm the agent.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.454
I'm supposed
to suck your blood.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.789
Come on, Sheila.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.791
The romance novel photo
shoot was brutal enough,

06:56.833 --> 06:58.210
but a little girl's
birthday party?

06:58.252 --> 06:59.544
Hey, that little
girl's daddy is

06:59.586 --> 07:01.546
a major client and offered
to pay double your base fee.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.631
Yeah, but I'm not a monkey,
I'm a model.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.885
Yes, and you definitely do pout
like one.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.636
Look, I'm sorry.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.513
This is what happens
when you break a contract.

07:10.555 --> 07:11.556
Now, until you finish

07:11.598 --> 07:13.474
paying off your debt from

07:13.516 --> 07:16.519
the rebellious
race-car fiasco,

07:16.561 --> 07:19.231
I'm afraid you are going
to be my hot,

07:19.273 --> 07:22.150
brooding,
indentured servant.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.242
Welcome to C.U.'s Fashion Design
Contest!

07:30.284 --> 07:31.952
You'll have just two days

07:31.993 --> 07:34.454
to design and complete
your collection.

07:34.495 --> 07:36.873
But don't worry, each of you
will be assembled a team

07:36.915 --> 07:39.626
a expert sewers in order
to help you realize your vision.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.796
And this year we have an extra
special surprise.

07:42.837 --> 07:45.548
Judging our runway show
will be no less

07:45.590 --> 07:48.218
than fashion icon
Janice Dickinson.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.514
(laughs)

07:53.556 --> 07:57.477
The competition begins... now.

08:00.688 --> 08:03.524
I've got this in Kate Spades.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.153
Perfect!

08:06.194 --> 08:08.529
Thank you, Mood!

08:08.571 --> 08:09.739
Sorry I'm late.

08:09.781 --> 08:10.824
Holly Strickler, I presume?

08:10.865 --> 08:12.742
Yes.
Please take your place.

08:14.244 --> 08:15.745
Well, well, well.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.581
Hello, Naomi.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.296
(boy whistling "Bridal Chorus")

08:24.338 --> 08:26.798
(scoffs) You guys need
some new material.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.426
(whistling continues)

08:34.972 --> 08:36.390
Hey. Hi.

08:36.433 --> 08:37.642
Hey.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.894
Thanks for finally
calling me back.

08:39.936 --> 08:43.606
I... how does one start
with the biggest apology ever?

08:43.648 --> 08:46.276
Silver, an apology's
not gonna

08:46.318 --> 08:48.153
return my life back
to the way it was.

08:48.195 --> 08:52.032
I know, but...

08:52.073 --> 08:54.284
You know that I didn't leak
that video on purpose, right?

08:54.326 --> 08:57.912
It was a horrible mistake.

08:57.954 --> 09:00.123
Yeah, a mistake that
not only humiliated me,

09:00.165 --> 09:02.042
it ruined my uncle's
campaign and turned

09:02.083 --> 09:03.710
my entire family
against me.

09:03.751 --> 09:06.421
But you want to know
the worst part?

09:06.463 --> 09:08.923
I'm going through all this
and I can't even talk

09:08.965 --> 09:10.842
to my best friend
because it's all her fault.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.305
So, what? Did you call me
all the way down here

09:15.347 --> 09:18.016
just to tell me
you're not gonna forgive me?

09:18.058 --> 09:21.602
No. I called you because I need
some closure with you.

09:21.644 --> 09:26.358
I accepted a coaching job
at a tennis camp in London.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.360
What?

09:28.402 --> 09:30.820
I'm leaving town.

09:32.531 --> 09:33.740
For good.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.648
Hi, Jeremy.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.484
What the hell
are you doing here?

10:09.526 --> 10:11.445
I need to talk to you.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.238
Look, I know that this is hard
for you to accept,

10:13.280 --> 10:15.365
but I was the one who was there
for Marla at the end,

10:15.407 --> 10:16.783
and she wanted me
to have the money.

10:16.824 --> 10:17.658
Look, I'm not gonna listen to
this.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.286
Listen, I know why you feel

10:19.327 --> 10:20.703
like your family deserves
the inheritance,

10:20.745 --> 10:22.914
which is why I'm proposing
that we split it.

10:22.956 --> 10:26.084
(chuckles)
Why would I give you half?

10:26.126 --> 10:29.087
Because you can either make
a deal with me right now

10:29.129 --> 10:31.756
or we can continue to fight
about the money for years.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.050
Either way, my lawyer said that
the only way

10:34.092 --> 10:36.052
your family can overturn
Marla's will

10:36.094 --> 10:38.555
is if there's some evidence
that I defrauded her.

10:38.597 --> 10:41.182
Which we both know
I didn't, so you'll

10:41.224 --> 10:44.144
have gone through all of this
and be left with nothing.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.985
Okay.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.778
I'll think about it.

10:59.993 --> 11:03.455
Ok, so our very first
group, this guy right here,

11:03.497 --> 11:05.248
he comes in
and he just blurts out...

11:05.290 --> 11:08.001
What would Charlie Sheen do?

11:08.042 --> 11:11.045
It's even funnier
the second time.

11:11.087 --> 11:14.299
Hey, what's a guy got to do
to get a beer around here?

11:14.341 --> 11:16.050
You just got out of rehab.

11:16.092 --> 11:19.220
Fine, fine,
make it a root beer.

11:19.262 --> 11:21.389
Can't blame a guy for trying.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.391
Oh, so I say we hit
the ground running.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.310
We book some
studio space pronto.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.395
Uh, see, actually I'm...

11:27.437 --> 11:30.273
I want to kind of take
things a little slower.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.192
Dix, we've been talking about
working on some tracks

11:32.233 --> 11:33.901
for weeks.
I know, and I still definitely

11:33.943 --> 11:37.113
want to work, but I think I just
need this time to separate

11:37.155 --> 11:39.282
my, you know, my addiction
from my music.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.075
Why would
you do that?

11:41.117 --> 11:42.910
It's all a creative cycle, D.

11:42.952 --> 11:46.080
We use the drugs to make
mind-blowing music,

11:46.122 --> 11:48.625
then go detox and rehab,
start over again.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.585
It's basic lather,
rinse, repeat stuff.

11:50.627 --> 11:54.548
Wait, so you don't plan on
actually staying sober?

11:54.589 --> 11:58.468
Trust me, you do not
want to hear the music
I make when I'm sober.

11:58.510 --> 12:03.557
Oh, uh, well, I, you know, I
actually plan on staying sober.

12:03.598 --> 12:06.725
So that's just going to take,
you know, a little more time.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.436
All right,
suit yourself.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.230
Oh, hey, I have

12:10.271 --> 12:13.149
an extra VIP pass for...

12:13.191 --> 12:16.069
The Imperial Interchange
concert tonight!

12:16.110 --> 12:18.154
Imperial Interchange?
Are you... are you serious?

12:18.196 --> 12:20.657
As serious as butt cancer.
You in?

12:20.699 --> 12:22.534
Hell, yeah, I'm in!
Yeah!

12:22.576 --> 12:24.911
(laughing)
(laughing)

12:28.289 --> 12:31.792
I didn't realize tinfoil
was considered a fabric.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.295
Like you didn't realize
vertical stripes

12:34.337 --> 12:35.796
don't actually
slim you down?

12:35.838 --> 12:39.634
Oh, Clark, won't you ever
get tired of losing to me?

12:39.676 --> 12:41.595
I'm not going to lose.

12:41.636 --> 12:42.970
Not only are my
designs brilliant,

12:43.012 --> 12:45.181
but I actually happen
to be close friends

12:45.223 --> 12:47.601
with the hottest male
model on the West Coast.

12:47.642 --> 12:49.018
You know, I almost feel

12:49.060 --> 12:51.396
sorry for you.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.691
I feel sorry for all
the Mylar balloons that
died on this table.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.277
This is an ambitious choice,
but I've always said

12:57.318 --> 12:59.237
that great fashion
is all about ambition.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.864
So I'm interested to see
how this is going to turn out.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.117
I think it will look
god-awful under the
Student Union fluorescents.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.745
Well, Holly does have a catty,
yet salient point.

13:06.785 --> 13:09.456
You've got to consider
the full presentation.
I'm sure there's going to be

13:09.497 --> 13:11.750
efforts to spruce the
place up a bit, right?

13:11.790 --> 13:14.168
Unfortch, it's a school budget.

13:14.210 --> 13:18.005
So a Bryant Park tent
it will not be.

13:18.047 --> 13:21.259
Um, what if I were to make
a sizable donation

13:21.301 --> 13:22.761
to benefit the program?

13:22.801 --> 13:25.346
Just to glam
everything up a bit.

13:25.388 --> 13:26.598
Anonymously, of course.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.182
I would not want to influence
the judging.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.184
(chuckles)
My stars.

13:30.226 --> 13:33.062
You positively radiate ambition,
don't you?

13:33.104 --> 13:34.105
Bravo, Naomi.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.610
Well, looks like I
can tailor the event

13:38.652 --> 13:40.194
to put my collection
in the best light.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.155
I guess this just
became my show.

13:45.199 --> 13:48.869
Nice. My agent just got me
a runway show at C.U.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.955
It'll pay off a huge
hunk of my contract.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.749
Naomi asked me to do
it as a favor.

13:52.791 --> 13:55.335
Didn't expect her
to cough up the cash.

13:55.376 --> 13:58.797
Well, it's nice to see Naomi
giving money to charity.

13:58.837 --> 14:00.799
And you're still losing.

14:00.839 --> 14:03.510
Man, you're still cheating.
Oh, give me a break.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.303
You up for one last
beach day tomorrow?

14:05.345 --> 14:06.095
Yeah.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.601
Hey.

14:11.643 --> 14:15.896
I'm going... I'm going
to go boss Ade around.

14:21.653 --> 14:23.904
So what are you doing here?

14:23.946 --> 14:25.573
Silver told me
you're leaving.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.867
Yeah, day after tomorrow.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.661
So I thought I'd
come say good-bye.

14:29.703 --> 14:34.207
I'm headed back to D.C. for my
last semester at Georgetown.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.125
I also got an internship
at a gay rights nonprofit.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.044
Sounds perfect for you.

14:39.671 --> 14:42.215
Teddy, I know you're still upset
about the whole video mess.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.217
I wish it had never happened
either, but it did.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.678
Running away isn't
going to fix anything.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.596
Your friends really
care about you.

14:48.638 --> 14:49.930
Especially Silver.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.684
And I do, too.

14:52.726 --> 14:56.062
Look, Shane, you just...

14:56.103 --> 14:58.523
You don't understand
what it's like.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.734
Every time I turn on the TV,
there's some conservative

15:00.775 --> 15:02.360
labeling me the country's
worst problem,

15:02.402 --> 15:04.987
or some liberal calling
me a civil rights hero.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.281
I'm under a microscope now.
Your dad's a movie star.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.827
People noticing you
isn't anything new.

15:10.869 --> 15:13.872
This is different than
the paparazzi outside
of my dentist's.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.999
I want to be a normal person,
not the hot topic on The View.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.587
What's normal?
You're a person.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.797
One that can do amazing things
for so many people.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.257
You can have a bigger impact
in a day

15:24.298 --> 15:25.884
than I can in a whole year.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.468
Do you know how jealous
that makes me?

15:27.510 --> 15:30.513
You know, it's no secret
that you and I are different.

15:32.473 --> 15:35.184
Yeah.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.811
I guess we are.

15:36.853 --> 15:39.480
Yeah.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.566
You know, one day...

15:41.608 --> 15:44.944
I hope you understand that you
were never a cause to me.

15:46.863 --> 15:51.618
I just want to be there
for someone who feels
completely alone.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.245
But you'll never understand that
'cause you have your friends.

16:04.380 --> 16:07.258
Hey. Thanks
for stopping by.
Yeah.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.260
I needed some air,
but now the window's stuck.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.763
And I woke up to a bird just
hanging out on the headboard,

16:11.805 --> 16:13.556
just looking at me.

16:13.598 --> 16:16.183
They must have heard
my scream in the O.C.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.018
Sometimes it just
needs some tough love.

16:19.604 --> 16:20.814
One...
One...

16:20.855 --> 16:22.189
two, three.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.149
Whoa.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.197
Don't open that window again.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.953
Silver, Silver...

16:34.994 --> 16:37.371
You broke up with me, remember?

16:37.413 --> 16:39.248
Yeah. Just... just wait, okay?

16:39.290 --> 16:42.418
No, Navid,
I can't do this anymore.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.587
It's time for me to move on,
and you know what?

16:44.629 --> 16:46.005
It's time for you to move out.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.132
By the end of the month, okay?

16:48.174 --> 16:50.468
Just give me some time,
okay? You and I...
I met someone.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.638
You and I are done.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.790
Oh!

17:20.832 --> 17:21.708
(laughing)

17:21.749 --> 17:24.627
Yes!

17:24.669 --> 17:29.549
That, my friend, is what
we call kicking your ass.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.010
Oh, man, I'm going
to miss days like this.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.679
Well, Teddy, you
don't have to leave.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.806
Yeah, I do.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.268
I think we've got time
for one more game

17:41.310 --> 17:42.979
before I've got to jet
to Naomi's runway show.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.356
(laughing)
What?

17:45.398 --> 17:47.274
Hey, you think Silver
will be there?

17:47.316 --> 17:49.151
Nah. Maybe I should
just talk to her.

17:49.193 --> 17:53.781
Um, actually
maybe you shouldn't.

17:53.823 --> 17:56.158
Uh, she's probably going to be
there with the new guy.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.994
I don't think
there is a new guy.

17:58.036 --> 17:59.203
I think she's bluffing.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.958
What?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.210
Hey, spit it out.

18:06.252 --> 18:09.756
No, it's just...
she's not bluffing.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.049
She brought him
to Liam's

18:11.090 --> 18:12.884
Thanksgiving
dinner.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.343
Thanksgiving?

18:14.385 --> 18:16.095
Maybe we should have told you.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.639
We just didn't want
to make you upset.
Hey, no, man.

18:18.681 --> 18:20.516
I'm a mature adult.
I can handle this.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.643
I can handle
some stupid fashion show.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.395
No, I'm in.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.439
Cool.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.982
Hey, come with me.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.483
No, man, I don't think so.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.069
Things are way weird
with Silver and I.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.695
I think it's better
if I don't go.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.364
You know what, I'm sorry,
Teddy, I'm just like...

18:35.406 --> 18:37.617
I'm really sick of this
whole "poor me" act.

18:37.658 --> 18:40.119
You are one of the
luckiest guys I know.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.705
I mean, you have infinite
opportunity ahead of you,
you're wealthy,

18:42.747 --> 18:44.791
and you have your health
above all, okay?

18:44.832 --> 18:46.459
It just feels like, I don't
know, like everything

18:46.500 --> 18:48.168
that's coming out of your mouth
these days is about how you feel

18:48.210 --> 18:51.130
so misunderstood, and how you
can't wait to jet off to London.

18:51.171 --> 18:52.966
Don't get me wrong,
I hear you.

18:53.007 --> 18:55.301
It's just-- it's not always
going to be about you.

18:55.342 --> 18:56.761
And right now it's not.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.972
It's about supporting Naomi
and supporting Navid and...

18:59.013 --> 19:00.681
sorry for the tough love, man,

19:00.723 --> 19:02.100
but quit your complaining,
'cause you're going.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.559
Simple as that.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.940
The lawyers for the Templeton
family called this morning

19:08.982 --> 19:12.151
and they are interested in your
offer to split the inheritance.

19:12.192 --> 19:16.196
Oh, my gosh, you have no
idea how bad I needed to
hear some good news.

19:16.238 --> 19:19.075
There's just one
outstanding issue.

19:19.117 --> 19:22.036
The family started cataloging
the estate to determine

19:22.078 --> 19:25.665
how to divide the assets,
and it appears there's
a necklace missing.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.416
Oh, that's not missing.

19:27.458 --> 19:28.960
Marla gave me that
necklace as a gift.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.754
Great. We'll need to
return it for appraisal.

19:31.796 --> 19:34.090
Oh, I don't have it anymore.

19:34.132 --> 19:36.676
I sold it.
You sold it?

19:36.717 --> 19:39.219
Right after she passed.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.805
I needed money
for college tuition.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.306
Is that a problem?

19:42.348 --> 19:44.558
Ms. Wilson, our entire case
hinges on the fact

19:44.600 --> 19:46.310
that you were closer
to that woman

19:46.352 --> 19:49.438
than her own family.
And I was.

19:49.480 --> 19:53.109
Frankly, the fact that
you sold the necklace so
soon after her death,

19:53.151 --> 19:55.028
it looks very bad.

19:55.069 --> 19:57.321
If they are able
to make it look like

19:57.363 --> 19:58.990
you were only after
Ms. Templeton's money,

19:59.032 --> 20:00.491
you'll never see a cent.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.326
I suggest you track down
that necklace

20:02.368 --> 20:04.578
right away.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.333
Hey, babe.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.835
Miss you already.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.129
Don't wait up for me.
So you're actually

20:13.171 --> 20:17.091
gonna go to the concert?

20:17.133 --> 20:19.844
Yes, yes, I am.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.763
Do you think hanging out with
Mr. Lather, Rinse and Repeat

20:22.805 --> 20:24.140
is a good idea?

20:24.182 --> 20:28.102
Ade, J.D. can't make me do
anything I don't want to.

20:28.144 --> 20:31.898
And plus, there's going
to be so many different
industry people there,

20:31.939 --> 20:34.108
I have a chance to get
my career back to where
it was before rehab.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.318
Really?

20:36.360 --> 20:37.862
Look at this.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.701
SILVER:
Okay, so, uh, unfortunately,

20:43.743 --> 20:45.369
Dixon is a little under
the weather.

20:45.411 --> 20:48.664
Yeah, I know, but...

20:48.706 --> 20:51.125
Ade, I don't want to relive
a performance that I missed

20:51.167 --> 20:53.252
because I was high.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.504
You need to remember
where you were before rehab,

20:55.546 --> 20:57.715
and how you never want
to get back to that place.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.383
Okay, I get it, all right?

20:59.425 --> 21:01.969
But the world is filled
of people who drink alcohol

21:02.011 --> 21:03.930
and use drugs.
Okay, you're not
listening to me.

33:48.735 --> 33:51.363
JANICE DICKINSON:
Excuse me, ladies.
I can't believe it.

33:51.404 --> 33:53.156
It looks like the real
show's back here.

33:53.198 --> 33:56.952
Ms. Clark, you were quite the
brazen entertainer out there.

33:56.994 --> 33:59.162
I gotta admire that,
but your designs,

33:59.204 --> 34:00.831
they can't pass
as serious fashion.

34:00.873 --> 34:03.249
Sorry, honey.

34:03.291 --> 34:05.043
And you, Ms. Holly,
you've surprised me...

34:05.084 --> 34:07.629
with some of the worst fashion

34:07.671 --> 34:09.715
that I've ever seen
in my entire life.

34:09.755 --> 34:12.175
Believe me, you're
no fashion designer.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.302
I suggest the two of
you stick to catfights,

34:14.344 --> 34:15.971
and stay off the catwalk.

34:16.013 --> 34:18.056
Seriously, have a nice life.

34:18.097 --> 34:19.808
Come on, darling.

34:31.904 --> 34:33.822
Hey, hey, hey.

34:33.864 --> 34:35.574
You shouldn't be here.

34:35.614 --> 34:37.701
You'll blow your cover.
Yeah, I don't care anymore.

34:37.743 --> 34:39.536
Okay? Silver saw
you kiss me in Vegas,

34:39.578 --> 34:41.871
and now she thinks there's
something going on between us.

34:41.914 --> 34:43.331
Isn't that insane?

34:43.373 --> 34:45.123
Look, you just need
to calm down and remember

34:45.166 --> 34:46.292
we need to be patient.

34:46.333 --> 34:47.835
Yeah, I'm done with
being patient. Okay?

34:47.878 --> 34:49.504
I need to bust Amal
on this car delivery.

34:49.545 --> 34:50.964
Navid...
No, I'm sorry, Kat.

34:51.005 --> 34:53.050
Whether you help me out
or not, this has to end.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.467
Now.

34:58.847 --> 35:01.058
WOMAN:
Sorry, I can't help you.
We're closing now.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.476
Look, I know that you said
you can't give me a name,

35:03.518 --> 35:04.770
but if you would just
hear me out....

35:04.811 --> 35:06.772
I'm sorry.

35:06.813 --> 35:09.775
We take the confidentiality of
our customers very seriously.

35:09.816 --> 35:11.192
You have a nice night, now.

35:11.234 --> 35:14.487
But... but when I
sold you the necklace,

35:14.529 --> 35:16.990
I didn't even realize that
it was a family heirloom.

35:17.032 --> 35:19.492
I-I-It was, it was
my grandmother's.

35:19.534 --> 35:21.703
Marla Templeton
was your grandmother?

35:21.745 --> 35:25.331
Yeah. And, and if I don't
get it back right away,

35:25.373 --> 35:27.417
then I'm gonna be
in so much trouble.

35:27.459 --> 35:30.503
It's funny, the buyer actually
told me a very similar story.

35:30.545 --> 35:31.671
What?

35:31.713 --> 35:33.256
The gentleman went
on and on about

35:33.298 --> 35:35.174
the necklace's
sentimental value,

35:35.216 --> 35:37.218
his grandmother,
blah, blah, blah.

35:37.260 --> 35:38.678
You should stop
wasting my time,

35:38.720 --> 35:40.639
and talk to your family instead.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.350
Oh, my God.

35:44.392 --> 35:45.268
Jeremy.

35:47.687 --> 35:49.397
Naomi Clark?

35:49.439 --> 35:51.900
The one and only.

35:51.942 --> 35:54.569
Well, after that
spectacle tonight,

35:54.611 --> 35:57.739
it's crystal clear that
you do not have a future

35:57.781 --> 35:59.783
in fashion design.
Okay.

35:59.825 --> 36:02.119
Thank you for your unsolicited
soul-crushing honesty.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.954
What, do you write
greeting cards?
(laughs)

36:03.996 --> 36:06.372
You didn't let me finish.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.333
Have you ever considered
event planning?

36:10.251 --> 36:14.006
See, an event of this
magnitude, and quality,

36:14.047 --> 36:18.718
would have taken my team...
about a week to execute.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.304
I want you to intern
for my company.

36:21.346 --> 36:24.390
You're... Rachel Gray.

36:24.432 --> 36:25.976
You plan the hottest
events in Hollywood.

36:26.018 --> 36:28.145
The one and only.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.981
So?

36:31.023 --> 36:32.440
What do you say?

36:32.482 --> 36:35.610
Um, what do I say?
Party planning?

36:35.652 --> 36:38.196
The thing I love most
in this world? Yes!

36:38.237 --> 36:40.323
Yes!
Good.

36:43.576 --> 36:44.577
SILVER:
That's the last of it.

36:50.083 --> 36:52.752
Bye.

36:52.794 --> 36:54.087
I can't believe
you're really leaving.

36:54.129 --> 36:55.797
I mean, who's going to
treat me to mani/pedis

36:55.839 --> 36:57.590
and tell me how fab
my shoes are?

36:57.632 --> 36:59.342
Yeah, um... I never
did those things.

36:59.384 --> 37:00.760
Well, you should have.

37:00.802 --> 37:02.846
I'll babysit your board
while you're gone.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.181
It'll be here
when you get back.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.640
Thanks, bro.

37:05.682 --> 37:07.475
We better go. Ready?

37:07.517 --> 37:09.519
Yeah.

37:11.479 --> 37:13.481
Uh... almost.

37:13.523 --> 37:15.525
♪ ♪

37:37.296 --> 37:40.675
Charles. It's Teddy.

37:40.717 --> 37:41.718
Again.

37:44.387 --> 37:45.931
Before I leave town, I just...

37:45.972 --> 37:48.100
I need to tell you that I'm
sorry about what happened.

37:50.393 --> 37:53.939
I'm sorry you don't
approve of who I am.

37:53.980 --> 37:57.483
I want my family in my life,
I really do,

37:57.525 --> 38:00.278
but... I've realized
that I don't need you.

38:02.697 --> 38:06.701
I don't need anyone's
approval but my own.

38:06.743 --> 38:08.369
I'll apologize until
I'm blue in the face

38:08.411 --> 38:10.580
about that stupid video, but...

38:10.622 --> 38:13.208
...I'll never apologize
for who I am.

38:13.250 --> 38:17.712
Oh, and if you see my dad...

38:17.754 --> 38:19.172
tell him his son is happy.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.262
(honks)

38:25.303 --> 38:26.930
SILVER:
Shane!

38:26.972 --> 38:28.598
Shane.
(laughs)

38:29.975 --> 38:32.894
Well, the drive to D.C.
is pretty long, and, uh,

38:32.936 --> 38:34.729
Teddy is tone deaf and
he likes to hog the radio,

38:34.771 --> 38:36.439
so I got you a little
present.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.316
SHANE:
Earplugs.
Yeah.

38:38.357 --> 38:39.734
Wow, you're a lifesaver!

38:39.776 --> 38:41.736
Sure.
Well, we should hit the road.

38:41.778 --> 38:43.196
We should've been
in Utah by now.

38:43.238 --> 38:45.115
Yeah.
Just need a...

38:45.157 --> 38:47.325
Oh...

38:47.366 --> 38:48.910
You guys are gonna
make a good team.

38:48.952 --> 38:50.578
Oh, well...

38:50.620 --> 38:52.789
who knows what's
gonna happen with us.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.792
But Shane helped me finally
realize that going away

38:55.834 --> 38:57.961
and doing something about
a problem is different than

38:58.003 --> 38:58.837
running away and
hiding from it.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.338
Some good comes from some bad.

39:00.379 --> 39:02.632
Exactly.

39:02.674 --> 39:05.426
I'm going to miss
you, Mr. Montgomery.

39:05.468 --> 39:07.095
Ah, come on.

39:07.137 --> 39:09.430
You know I'm gonna call you
and write you and text you

39:09.472 --> 39:11.683
and e-mail you,
like, every day.
No, you won't.

39:11.724 --> 39:13.268
I know I won't.

39:13.310 --> 39:16.021
But I'll be thinking
about you all the time.

39:16.062 --> 39:17.063
Same.

39:18.606 --> 39:21.026
Bye.

39:21.067 --> 39:23.153
Ah... Don't be
a stranger, all right?

39:30.035 --> 39:32.829
TEDDY:
Ready to rock.

39:32.871 --> 39:33.830
SHANE:
Bye.

39:51.014 --> 39:53.933
Looking for all the hopes and
dreams you lost here last night?

39:53.975 --> 39:57.270
No, actually, I've moved on.

39:57.312 --> 39:59.231
Resiliency is yet another
one of my many talents.

40:03.026 --> 40:04.485
You know what?

40:04.527 --> 40:06.279
Can we just move on, too?

40:06.321 --> 40:08.365
I propose we bury the hatchet.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.700
All of our plotting and
conniving has really

40:10.742 --> 40:12.369
just come back to
bite us in the ass.

40:12.410 --> 40:15.330
I suppose physical violence
does take it a step too far.

40:20.459 --> 40:22.628
I'm sorry I stole your designs.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.047
I'm sorry they sucked.

40:24.089 --> 40:28.593
I don't know why I get so
crazy competitive around you.

40:28.634 --> 40:31.512
It's like I start
channeling my mother,

40:31.554 --> 40:33.431
and turn into an evil bitch.

40:33.472 --> 40:36.726
(laughs)

40:36.768 --> 40:39.645
So, cease-fire?

40:39.687 --> 40:42.899
I guess C.U. will have to be
big enough for the both of us.

40:42.941 --> 40:45.360
But we're not going
to have slumber parties

40:45.402 --> 40:47.112
and braid each other's hair.
Oh, my God, no.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.113
(cell phone chimes)

40:48.154 --> 40:50.323
Oh, speak of the devil.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.533
Having lunch with my mother.

40:52.575 --> 40:54.535
See you around, Clark.

40:54.577 --> 40:55.703
Good luck.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.336
Hi, Mom.

41:04.587 --> 41:06.381
Oh, sweetheart.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.551
This is so cute.

41:10.593 --> 41:12.387
Now, you aren't
really going to

41:12.429 --> 41:14.472
make me eat this dreadful
campus food, are you?

41:14.513 --> 41:17.058
We can go wherever
you'd like.
Good.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.810
Mom.
Hmm?

41:18.851 --> 41:20.853
Uh, by the way, have you

41:20.895 --> 41:22.814
had a chance to think
about the internship?

41:22.855 --> 41:24.607
I'd really like to do it.

41:24.649 --> 41:26.525
Oh. Yes, you know,
I'm so sorry, dear.

41:26.567 --> 41:29.737
I've decided to go
with someone else.

41:29.779 --> 41:33.366
Come on. I'm in
the mood for French.
