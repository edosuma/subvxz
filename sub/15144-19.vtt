13:39.917 --> 13:41.208
But I ain't most guys.

13:41.250 --> 13:42.500
Now hand me my cake carrier.

13:42.542 --> 13:44.250
I'm taking this love show

13:42.542 --> 13:44.250
on the road.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.875
- Uh, no!

13:45.917 --> 13:48.166
You don't want to do that.

13:45.917 --> 13:48.166
- Of course I do.

13:48.208 --> 13:49.875
The only thing

13:48.208 --> 13:49.875
that would keep me away from Mae

13:49.917 --> 13:52.083
is if she likes another guy.

13:52.125 --> 13:53.458
- [snaps fingers]

13:53.500 --> 13:56.041
Funny you should mention that.

13:56.083 --> 13:58.250
Mae likes another guy.

13:56.083 --> 13:58.250
- She does?

13:58.291 --> 14:01.250
- Yup, one minute she's all

13:58.291 --> 14:01.250
about her secret admirer,

14:01.291 --> 14:06.125
next minute she's doodling

14:01.291 --> 14:06.125
"Mrs. Mae Newguy...erson."

14:06.166 --> 14:08.750
He just moved here from Sweden.

14:08.792 --> 14:10.417
- This is terrible.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.834
- Aww.

14:12.875 --> 14:15.709
There'll be others.

14:15.750 --> 14:18.166
- I heard voices.

14:15.750 --> 14:18.166
Is Mae here?

14:18.208 --> 14:19.750
- Yeah, about that.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.750
I--I have some bad news.

14:21.792 --> 14:23.375
Mae met another boy.

14:23.417 --> 14:25.500
And he's Swedish.

14:25.542 --> 14:28.583
- Yeah, well, he may be

14:25.542 --> 14:28.583
sweet-ish,

14:28.625 --> 14:31.250
but I'm sweet-er.

14:31.291 --> 14:33.000
- It doesn't matter

14:31.291 --> 14:33.000
how sweet you are.

14:33.041 --> 14:34.375
She's met another guy.

14:34.417 --> 14:36.083
I'm sorry.

14:34.417 --> 14:36.083
It's over.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.709
- Oh, okay.

14:37.750 --> 14:42.000
Guess I'll just go back upstairs

14:37.750 --> 14:42.000
and forget about her.

14:42.041 --> 14:43.083
Or...

14:43.125 --> 14:44.667
- What "or"?

14:43.125 --> 14:44.667
There is no "or"!

14:44.709 --> 14:46.583
- I could apply a fresh coat

14:44.709 --> 14:46.583
of body spray

14:46.625 --> 14:47.917
and go fight for her.

14:47.959 --> 14:49.875
- Wait! No!

14:47.959 --> 14:49.875
I don't really think...

14:49.917 --> 14:51.917
- Dawn, I've decided

14:49.917 --> 14:51.917
to fight for her.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.583
- What?

14:51.959 --> 14:53.583
No! Fighting is bad!

14:53.625 --> 14:55.166
- Not when it's for my lady.

14:55.208 --> 14:57.250
Oh, I'm gonna bring her

14:55.208 --> 14:57.250
this cake and win her back.

14:57.291 --> 15:00.083
- Uh--but not with that cake,

14:57.291 --> 15:00.083
you're not.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.917
It's totally smudged.

15:01.959 --> 15:02.750
- Where?

15:02.792 --> 15:04.625
- Uh...right over here.

15:05.542 --> 15:07.333
I mean, right over here.

15:07.375 --> 15:08.834
- [gasps]

15:08.875 --> 15:11.750
- Better go back in and fix it.

15:14.792 --> 15:15.834
- Hey, Dawn.

15:15.875 --> 15:18.458
- What are you doing here?

15:18.500 --> 15:20.750
I mean, hey,

15:18.500 --> 15:20.750
what are you doing here?

15:20.792 --> 15:22.125
- We couldn't stay at my house.

15:22.166 --> 15:23.917
Ricky's allergic

15:22.166 --> 15:23.917
to my cat, Debbie.

15:23.959 --> 15:27.208
- [sighs]

15:23.959 --> 15:27.208
Yeah, Debbie.

15:30.709 --> 15:32.834
- You've got to be kidding me.

15:32.875 --> 15:34.625
Can I have a word with you?

15:32.875 --> 15:34.625
[laughs]

15:34.667 --> 15:35.834
Excuse us.

15:35.875 --> 15:37.125
[door slams]

15:37.166 --> 15:39.166
I thought you told me

15:37.166 --> 15:39.166
you didn't like Mae.

15:39.208 --> 15:41.125
- I didn't, but now I do.

15:41.166 --> 15:43.667
And it's all because

15:41.166 --> 15:43.667
you made me go over there.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.125
So thank you.

15:45.166 --> 15:47.125
- Yay me.

15:47.166 --> 15:48.875
[laughs]

15:47.166 --> 15:48.875
What happened?

15:48.917 --> 15:50.667
- I can't explain it.

15:50.709 --> 15:52.208
I was nervous

15:50.709 --> 15:52.208
about my presentation,

15:52.250 --> 15:54.709
and then she said everything

15:52.250 --> 15:54.709
was going to be okay,

15:54.750 --> 15:57.667
and suddenly

15:54.750 --> 15:57.667
everything was okay.

15:57.709 --> 16:00.667
I mean, with most girls,

15:57.709 --> 16:00.667
I'm like, "Oh, no."

16:00.709 --> 16:04.458
But with Mae, I'm like,

16:00.709 --> 16:04.458
"Oh, yes."

16:04.500 --> 16:06.583
- Look, I didn't want

16:04.500 --> 16:06.583
to have to tell you this,

16:06.625 --> 16:08.125
but there's another boy.

16:08.166 --> 16:12.125
He's Swedish,

16:08.166 --> 16:12.125
and you don't stand a chance.

16:12.166 --> 16:14.208
- Swedish!

16:14.250 --> 16:15.750
I guess that's that.

16:15.792 --> 16:17.250
- [sighs]

16:17.291 --> 16:18.417
- Or...

16:18.458 --> 16:20.166
- No!

16:18.458 --> 16:20.166
- Yes, I'm going to--

16:20.208 --> 16:23.083
- Fight for her--

16:20.208 --> 16:23.083
yeah, yeah, I know!

16:23.125 --> 16:26.458
- I gotta ask.

16:23.125 --> 16:26.458
Am I coming in the house?

16:26.500 --> 16:28.166
Am I not coming in the house?

16:28.208 --> 16:30.291
- One second!

16:30.333 --> 16:31.333
[door slams]

16:31.375 --> 16:32.750
- Look, if you want Mae

16:31.375 --> 16:32.750
to like you,

16:32.792 --> 16:33.959
you've got to play it cool.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.250
Don't tell her you like her.

16:35.291 --> 16:36.709
In fact, don't tell anyone

16:35.291 --> 16:36.709
you like her.

16:36.750 --> 16:38.000
You know what, don't even speak.

16:38.041 --> 16:41.125
- Got it. I mean...

16:41.166 --> 16:43.625
- [snaps fingers]

16:43.667 --> 16:45.083
Hey.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.083
Glad you're here.

16:45.125 --> 16:46.917
You know,

16:45.125 --> 16:46.917
let's go grab some smoothies.

16:46.959 --> 16:48.709
- I'm not in the mood.

16:46.959 --> 16:48.709
- Soup, then.

16:48.750 --> 16:51.083
- But Ricky said he's going to

16:48.750 --> 16:51.083
help me with my math homework.

16:51.125 --> 16:52.542
- You don't need help with math.

16:52.583 --> 16:54.125
You're one

16:52.583 --> 16:54.125
of his brightest students.

16:54.458 --> 16:56.125
What you need is soup.

16:56.166 --> 16:58.709
And you know what today's soup

16:56.166 --> 16:58.709
of the day is?

16:58.750 --> 17:00.417
What's your favorite soup?

16:58.750 --> 17:00.417
- Alphabet?

17:00.458 --> 17:01.542
- Bingo! Let's go.

17:01.750 --> 17:04.125
- But, Dawn.

17:01.750 --> 17:04.125
I have to go to the bathroom.

17:04.166 --> 17:05.583
- Get Sporty has

17:04.166 --> 17:05.583
fresh urinal cakes.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.709
- But, Dawn,

17:05.625 --> 17:07.709
you're not even wearing shoes.

17:08.208 --> 17:09.792
- Okay, fine.

17:09.834 --> 17:11.375
I didn't want to have

17:09.834 --> 17:11.375
to tell you this,

17:11.417 --> 17:14.125
but a certain special someone

17:11.417 --> 17:14.125
left me a note saying he wanted

17:14.166 --> 17:16.709
to meet you at Get Sporty

17:14.166 --> 17:16.709
right now.

17:16.750 --> 17:18.667
- Do you mean...

17:16.750 --> 17:18.667
- Oh, yes.

17:18.709 --> 17:21.709
That special guy is going to be

17:18.709 --> 17:21.709
at Get Sporty any minute,

17:21.750 --> 17:25.083
waiting for you with a hot bowl

17:21.750 --> 17:25.083
of alphabet soup.

17:25.125 --> 17:27.750
He said he'll "A-B-C you there."

17:27.792 --> 17:28.792
- Really?

17:29.417 --> 17:30.333
Let's go!

17:33.709 --> 17:35.834
- Well, I certainly have no idea

17:33.709 --> 17:35.834
what they were talking about.

17:35.875 --> 17:37.375
- Me neither.

17:37.417 --> 17:39.166
- I don't understand what's

there'd be alphabet soup.

20:37.875 --> 20:40.583
My mom told me to keep

20:37.875 --> 20:40.583
an eye on them, and I completely

20:37.875 --> 20:40.583
messed it up.

20:40.625 --> 20:44.166
- Don't worry.

20:40.625 --> 20:44.166
Everything will be okay.

20:44.208 --> 20:46.458
- Aw, that's what my Mom says.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.458
[gasps]

20:47.500 --> 20:49.542
That's what my Mom says!

20:49.583 --> 20:50.792
Wait a minute.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.667
- I was nervous

20:50.834 --> 20:52.667
about my presentation,

20:52.709 --> 20:55.667
and then she said everything

20:52.709 --> 20:55.667
was going to be okay,

20:55.709 --> 20:57.583
and suddenly,

20:55.709 --> 20:57.583
everything was okay!

21:00.625 --> 21:02.750
- Ouchie go bye-bye.

21:04.667 --> 21:06.959
- Nurse Mae, I bumped my head.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.208
[boys shouting]

21:08.250 --> 21:11.291
- My box of chocolate!

21:08.250 --> 21:11.291
- Not anymore!

21:11.333 --> 21:12.375
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

21:12.417 --> 21:15.291
- This ends now!

21:15.333 --> 21:16.500
- Guys, stop!

21:16.542 --> 21:18.792
You don't like Mae.

21:16.542 --> 21:18.792
You just miss Mom.

21:18.834 --> 21:23.417
- We don't miss Mom.

21:18.834 --> 21:23.417
- That's childish.

21:18.834 --> 21:23.417
- What are we, babies?

21:23.458 --> 21:25.959
- So what's for dinner, Mae?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Okay, I see it now.

21:27.041 --> 21:28.625
both: Mm.

21:28.667 --> 21:30.959
- Look, we might not like Mae

21:28.667 --> 21:30.959
that way,

21:31.000 --> 21:34.208
but I want to go on record

21:31.000 --> 21:34.208
saying we don't miss our Mom.

21:34.250 --> 21:37.834
- Hey, guys, who wants to talk

21:34.250 --> 21:37.834
to Mom on video chat?

21:37.875 --> 21:39.792
- [gasps]

21:39.834 --> 21:42.458
I mean...

21:39.834 --> 21:42.458
I don't want to, but...

21:42.500 --> 21:44.333
she probably wants

21:42.500 --> 21:44.333
to say hi to us.

21:44.375 --> 21:47.000
- Yeah, bet she misses us

21:44.375 --> 21:47.000
like crazy.

21:47.041 --> 21:48.458
- She's so needy.

21:50.500 --> 21:52.417
Ugh, cooties.

21:54.500 --> 21:58.291
- Wait, so you told them

21:54.500 --> 21:58.291
I had cooties?

21:58.333 --> 22:00.542
- I... yeah, sorry.

22:00.583 --> 22:05.041
- And they still liked me?

22:05.083 --> 22:06.500
Mama's got game.
