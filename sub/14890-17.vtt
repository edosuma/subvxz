02:53.574 --> 02:54.975
I‐I should tell you that, uh

Balki takes everything

You have to be very careful

he can be a star

03:05.552 --> 03:07.521

just a moment of your time.

04:13.954 --> 04:17.023
I have a few questions.
When did I reconsider?

04:17.057 --> 04:20.260
What is an agent?
And when did you become one?

04:21.795 --> 04:24.531
A‐an agent is, uh,
someone like myself

04:24.565 --> 04:28.535
who negotiates big money deals
for a performer, like yourself

04:28.569 --> 04:30.403
in exchange
for a nominal percentage

04:30.436 --> 04:31.872
of the aforementioned
big money.

04:31.905 --> 04:36.342
Uh, I think the standard rate
is fifty percent?

04:38.679 --> 04:39.780
That’s not enough.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.782
Cousin, you should have
at least half.

04:41.815 --> 04:46.687
But...I’m not a performer,
I’m just Balki.

have Marshall and Walpole

for someone else’s work.

‐You’re right.
‐Thank you, cousin.

very difficult for me to say

but Balki won’t be making
