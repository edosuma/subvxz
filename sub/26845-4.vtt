WEBVTT

00:05.667 --> 00:07.667
( music playing )

01:40.417 --> 01:42.209
Hi, I'm Gene.

01:42.292 --> 01:43.459
I'm Gene.

01:45.501 --> 01:47.084
It's me. Gene.

02:02.125 --> 02:04.125
( knock on door )

02:04.209 --> 02:06.334
Yes?

02:06.417 --> 02:08.292
Man:
Uh, hello?

02:08.376 --> 02:10.708
Hi. Is it, uh...

02:10.792 --> 02:12.501
is it you?

02:12.583 --> 02:14.459
Yes. It's me.

02:19.125 --> 02:21.167
- Hey. Gene?
- Hi.

02:21.251 --> 02:22.708
- Dan?
- Yeah.

02:22.792 --> 02:24.417
OK. ( laughs )

02:25.708 --> 02:27.292
( both chuckling )

02:34.542 --> 02:36.459
Please. Come in.

02:36.542 --> 02:38.417
This is nice.

02:38.501 --> 02:40.042
- Is it OK?
- Yeah. Sure.

02:40.125 --> 02:42.292
- OK.
- Wait. Why do you ask?

02:42.376 --> 02:44.959
Oh, I don't know,
I didn't know, you know,

02:45.042 --> 02:46.084
what you were expecting.

02:46.167 --> 02:49.501
And-- or used to.
So, I--

02:50.583 --> 02:52.917
No, it's really nice.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.833
I-- I like the flower.

02:54.917 --> 02:57.417
And the candles.
And the dining table.

02:57.501 --> 03:00.209
It's just--
It's nice.

03:00.292 --> 03:01.833
It's nothing.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.209
Yeah, it's all lovely.

03:05.292 --> 03:06.376
Thanks.

03:06.459 --> 03:07.501
Thank you...

03:07.583 --> 03:09.167
for setting all this up.

03:12.542 --> 03:16.084
Hey, uh,
it's OK if we're
a little nervous, right?

03:16.167 --> 03:18.792
Uh, yeah. ( laughs )

03:18.875 --> 03:20.167
- Yes.
- OK, good.

03:20.251 --> 03:21.459
- Yeah.
- You seemed really calm.

03:21.542 --> 03:23.917
Oh, I am so not calm.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.708
- ( laughs )
- No, I-- I'm...

03:25.792 --> 03:27.583
utterly aflutter.

03:27.667 --> 03:30.042
I don't know why
I said that.  Sorry.

03:30.125 --> 03:32.583
No, no. I liked it.
"Utterly aflutter."

03:32.667 --> 03:33.750
It's poetic.

03:33.833 --> 03:35.292
- Yeah.
- And it's true.

03:35.376 --> 03:37.334
I feel that way too.

03:37.417 --> 03:38.708
Yeah.

03:42.625 --> 03:44.708
Maybe we just,
uh, dive in?

03:44.792 --> 03:46.542
- I'd like that.
- OK.

03:50.542 --> 03:54.125
- Let's see.
- ( object rattling )

03:54.209 --> 03:56.667
Oh. Here you go.

03:56.750 --> 03:57.833
Uh...

03:59.708 --> 04:00.708
18, 19, 20.

04:03.251 --> 04:04.917
Get you some water.

04:07.708 --> 04:10.459
( crunching )

04:10.583 --> 04:12.000
What's this one?

04:12.084 --> 04:15.417
- That is tranexamic acid.
- What's that?

04:15.501 --> 04:19.251
Uh, it helps regulate
the female menstrual cycle.

04:19.334 --> 04:22.334
And it slows down
bleeding.

04:22.417 --> 04:25.125
- So, you know, just in case.
- That's smart.

04:25.209 --> 04:26.667
- Right?
- Yeah.

04:26.750 --> 04:28.125
( both laugh )

04:31.667 --> 04:33.792
Oh. Yes, please.

04:33.875 --> 04:35.376
OK, good.

04:35.459 --> 04:37.251
I didn't know
if you were a drinker,

04:37.334 --> 04:39.917
and I didn't want you to think
I'm some kind of boozer

04:40.000 --> 04:41.833
or-- or something.

04:41.917 --> 04:43.251
( laughs )

04:47.000 --> 04:48.459
- Hmm.
- Nice.

04:50.583 --> 04:51.917
OK.

04:53.750 --> 04:54.792
Too-too-too.

04:55.959 --> 04:57.084
Hmm.

04:58.209 --> 05:00.084
- Thank you.
- There you go.

05:03.167 --> 05:04.917
Ah. ( laughs )

05:05.000 --> 05:07.959
Uh, to, uh,
the perfect night.

05:08.042 --> 05:09.917
Perfect night.
Where we can just--

05:10.000 --> 05:11.625
Where we can just be
exactly who we want--

05:11.708 --> 05:13.625
- ( laughing ) Jinx.
- ( laughing ) Jinx.

05:13.708 --> 05:15.875
Ah! Oh, my God!

05:15.959 --> 05:18.625
- That's twice--
- In a row.

05:18.708 --> 05:20.583
- This is crazy.
- I know.

05:23.251 --> 05:24.542
Hmm.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.917
Every-- Everything OK?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.708
Yeah, yeah, um...

05:29.792 --> 05:32.042
I think I might already
be starting to feel it.

05:32.125 --> 05:34.459
Really. It said 20 minutes.

05:34.583 --> 05:36.376
Up to 20 minutes.

05:36.459 --> 05:37.875
Also maybe considering
the dosage...

05:39.292 --> 05:41.084
Right. Right, OK.

05:41.167 --> 05:43.459
Um, let's get
everything ready.

05:43.542 --> 05:45.000
OK.

05:50.167 --> 05:52.875
( music playing )

06:24.875 --> 06:27.792
Shall we, uh,
get this out of the way?

06:27.875 --> 06:28.875
Oh. Yeah.

06:30.167 --> 06:31.959
- I, Gene--
- I, Dan--

06:32.042 --> 06:33.625
( both laughing )

06:33.708 --> 06:35.125
Jinx.

06:35.209 --> 06:37.125
It's like we're
the same person
or something.

06:37.209 --> 06:39.334
I know. There's an air of kismet
about all of it. I--

06:39.417 --> 06:41.209
Aw, I just said
there's an air of kismet.

06:41.292 --> 06:42.501
Now who's the poet?

06:42.583 --> 06:44.000
( both laugh )

06:44.084 --> 06:45.792
OK.

06:45.875 --> 06:48.625
I, Dan Bender,
am of sound mind

06:48.708 --> 06:50.833
and have previously agreed
to everything that I will do

06:50.917 --> 06:53.376
and that will be
done to me tonight.

06:53.459 --> 06:55.251
I, Gene Gerkin,

06:55.334 --> 06:57.167
am also  of sound mind,

06:57.251 --> 07:00.209
and have previously agreed
to everything that I will do

07:00.292 --> 07:02.376
and that will be
done to me tonight.

07:03.917 --> 07:06.833
Great.
You OK?

07:06.917 --> 07:08.167
Mm-hmm.

07:08.251 --> 07:10.125
Yeah, I think
just a few more minutes,

07:10.209 --> 07:13.750
just to make sure everything's
in the right place.

07:13.833 --> 07:16.501
You got it. Yeah.

07:16.583 --> 07:17.917
( exhales )

07:18.000 --> 07:20.667
I can't believe this night
is finally here.

07:20.750 --> 07:23.376
- I know, right?
- After all these months?

07:23.459 --> 07:26.376
All this correspondence?
All this not knowing?

07:26.459 --> 07:28.292
I'm just happy you came.

07:28.376 --> 07:30.084
I'm happy you  came.

07:30.167 --> 07:32.125
I have to admit,
for a while I was
starting to worry

07:32.209 --> 07:35.209
that this was just gonna
turn out to be a big... joke.

07:35.292 --> 07:36.833
- Me too.
- Really?

07:36.917 --> 07:38.417
Yeah. Sure. I mean,

07:38.501 --> 07:40.667
you and I,
we understand this,

07:40.750 --> 07:44.084
but I don't think
a lot of other people would.

07:49.583 --> 07:51.209
Gene?

07:51.292 --> 07:52.667
Yeah?

07:54.125 --> 07:56.959
I think--
I think I'm ready now.

07:58.625 --> 08:00.625
OK, Dan. OK.

08:14.625 --> 08:16.625
- OK. Here, buddy.
- Thanks.

08:19.959 --> 08:21.209
- OK.
- Watch your head.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.376
- Ahh.
- There you go.

09:13.084 --> 09:15.875
( deep breath )
You ready, Dan?

09:17.708 --> 09:18.667
I'm ready.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.042
OK.

09:23.583 --> 09:25.708
- ( snipping sound )
- Dan: Ahh.

09:27.209 --> 09:30.501
- Did you get it?
- I got it.

09:30.583 --> 09:32.501
( exhales )

09:34.833 --> 09:36.376
You hold that.

09:41.959 --> 09:43.417
There we go.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.084
Nice. Nice.

09:49.167 --> 09:50.583
( exhales )

09:56.084 --> 09:57.376
( grunts )

09:58.792 --> 10:00.708
- ( sizzling sounds )
- Mm.

10:05.251 --> 10:08.334
( sizzling continues )

10:08.417 --> 10:10.042
Ooh.

10:12.042 --> 10:14.334
( sniffs )

10:14.417 --> 10:16.750
It smells... good.

10:16.833 --> 10:20.209
I know, right? I wa--
I wasn't expecting that.

10:20.292 --> 10:21.334
Were you?

10:21.417 --> 10:23.000
No.

10:23.084 --> 10:24.875
It smells like...

10:24.959 --> 10:28.292
nothing I've ever--
ever smelled before.

10:28.376 --> 10:29.542
- Right?
- Yeah, agreed.

10:29.625 --> 10:31.833
- It's weird.
- It smells incredible.

10:31.917 --> 10:34.917
Yeah. It really,
really does.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.833
( sizzling )

10:39.917 --> 10:41.334
Nice.

10:41.417 --> 10:44.334
How you doin'?
How's the bleeding?

10:44.417 --> 10:47.167
It's under control for now.

10:47.251 --> 10:48.376
OK, great.

10:48.459 --> 10:50.251
Let's just get you
over here.

10:50.334 --> 10:52.042
Thanks.

10:52.125 --> 10:53.792
There you go.
( chuckles )

11:04.125 --> 11:05.292
OK.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.501
- Ahh.
- Thank you.

11:17.583 --> 11:19.417
Well, you're welcome.

11:19.501 --> 11:21.417
No, I mean, thank you...

11:21.501 --> 11:24.542
for doing for me-- with me--

11:24.625 --> 11:26.501
what nobody else
seems to understand.

11:27.708 --> 11:29.917
Thank you for the same.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.959
I mean, I'm excited for this.
And for my turn next.

11:34.042 --> 11:36.667
It didn't hurt much at all,
by the way.

11:39.334 --> 11:40.542
Shall we?

11:40.625 --> 11:41.583
Before it gets cold?

11:41.667 --> 11:42.583
( both laugh )

11:42.667 --> 11:44.376
( banging on door )

11:47.167 --> 11:48.542
( knocking )

11:48.625 --> 11:50.875
Woman:
This is the police! Open up!

11:50.959 --> 11:53.459
- Jesus Christ.
- What?

11:53.542 --> 11:55.708
( Gene muttering )

11:58.750 --> 12:00.708
( banging insistently )

12:03.917 --> 12:05.334
Open up!

12:05.417 --> 12:07.833
Coming! I'm just getting
out of the bathroom!

12:07.917 --> 12:09.959
( whispers )
OK, come on,
come on, come on.

12:10.042 --> 12:11.376
Come on.

12:11.459 --> 12:13.251
( banging on door )

12:13.334 --> 12:16.125
OK. Stay in here

12:16.209 --> 12:17.417
and don't come out
no matter what.

12:17.501 --> 12:19.501
- ( banging )
- OK.

12:25.209 --> 12:26.708
No, no, no, no, no.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.376
Mmm!

12:30.459 --> 12:32.084
- It's so good!
- Really?

12:32.167 --> 12:35.501
- Cop: What's that?
- Nothing! Just a sec!

12:35.583 --> 12:37.501
( Gene whispering )

12:37.583 --> 12:40.251
What the hell
is wrong with you?

12:46.959 --> 12:50.376
- Oh. So good.
- ( banging on door )

12:50.459 --> 12:52.125
Cop:
If you don't open this door,

12:52.209 --> 12:54.084
I'm gonna be forced
to break it down.

12:54.167 --> 12:55.583
Sorry. Coming!

12:57.501 --> 12:59.000
How can I help you,
Officer?

12:59.084 --> 13:01.959
Why did it take you so long
to open this door?

13:02.042 --> 13:03.875
I told you.
I was in the bathroom.

13:14.959 --> 13:16.417
What's your name?

13:16.501 --> 13:19.251
- M-My name?
- Yes, your name.

13:19.334 --> 13:20.792
- Gene.
- Gene what?

13:20.875 --> 13:22.875
Gene Gerkin!

13:22.959 --> 13:26.959
Is there a Dan Bender
here with you tonight?

13:27.042 --> 13:29.667
Uh, I don't know anyone
by that name.

13:29.750 --> 13:32.750
Well, who's all this for?

13:32.833 --> 13:36.292
Um, for me. My friend.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.542
Uh-huh.

13:40.625 --> 13:43.042
Let's see here.

13:43.125 --> 13:45.376
Jill Bender.

13:45.459 --> 13:48.792
She found some unusual
and cryptic emails

13:48.875 --> 13:51.417
on her husband Dan's
computer last week.

13:51.501 --> 13:54.917
She did not
divulge the content,
but became concerned.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.583
She followed him here

13:56.667 --> 13:59.042
and watched him
walk into this  room

13:59.125 --> 14:01.000
ten minutes ago.

14:01.084 --> 14:02.792
She called us
to check it out,

14:02.875 --> 14:05.209
as she had reason to fear
his life,

14:05.292 --> 14:07.459
based on his emails.

14:09.334 --> 14:11.501
You want to tell me
where he's at?

14:13.167 --> 14:15.042
You know, I have to ask,

14:15.125 --> 14:19.376
isn't this something
you generally need
a warrant for?

14:19.459 --> 14:22.376
I suggest you tell me
where the gentleman is.

14:22.459 --> 14:23.750
I understand that,

14:23.833 --> 14:26.583
it's just I paid
for this hotel room

14:26.667 --> 14:29.459
and I'm not doing
anything wrong here.

14:29.542 --> 14:31.750
Is he here?

14:31.833 --> 14:34.167
( laughs )

14:35.583 --> 14:37.625
Is he hiding?

14:37.708 --> 14:38.583
Hmm?

15:01.708 --> 15:05.959
( jiggling doorknob )

15:06.042 --> 15:07.501
Don't!

15:10.542 --> 15:12.376
( pulls shower curtain back )

15:22.084 --> 15:23.459
Why'd you scream?

15:25.084 --> 15:28.459
I don't know.
I mean, you scared me.

15:28.542 --> 15:30.750
Y-You know,
you just come in here
and disrupt my evening--

15:30.833 --> 15:33.084
If you see Dan Bender,
tell him his wife

15:33.167 --> 15:35.417
is looking for him
and to go home.

15:37.084 --> 15:38.792
Uh, excuse me.

15:38.875 --> 15:40.583
What?

15:40.667 --> 15:44.376
I want your name
and badge number, please.

15:49.125 --> 15:50.917
Excuse me?

15:51.000 --> 15:53.125
I mean, your actions
here tonight

15:53.209 --> 15:56.042
are in total violation
of my rights!

15:56.125 --> 15:58.583
And I plan on filing
a report.

16:05.042 --> 16:07.167
You gonna
file a report?

16:07.251 --> 16:08.542
Yeah.

16:08.625 --> 16:10.875
Yeah, I think
I just might.

16:10.959 --> 16:12.708
- Is she gone?
- Ohh.

16:12.792 --> 16:15.209
Both of you get down!
Down on the ground!

16:15.292 --> 16:16.708
Please, just hold on.
I can ex--

16:16.792 --> 16:19.376
Ow! Damn! Gah!

16:19.459 --> 16:21.708
Fuck! Ahh!

16:21.792 --> 16:25.583
- Please! Just let me--
- Shh!

16:30.042 --> 16:32.459
What the fuck?

16:33.833 --> 16:34.708
Don't move!

16:34.792 --> 16:37.376
Don't you fuckin' move!

16:37.459 --> 16:40.792
This is Pankin,
I'm at the motel
near the parkway.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.708
- I need backup.
- Please!

16:42.792 --> 16:44.042
- Let me just explain!
- Stay down.

16:44.125 --> 16:45.417
Stay the fuck down.

16:45.501 --> 16:47.501
I have two males,

16:47.583 --> 16:49.334
two gay  males--

16:49.417 --> 16:51.209
No, we're not gay.
I have a wife.

16:51.292 --> 16:53.042
Even if we were,
what does that
have to do with it?

16:53.125 --> 16:56.292
Some crazy fucked-up shit
happening here

16:56.376 --> 16:59.167
like some kind of
Silence of the Lambs  shit.

16:59.251 --> 17:01.417
We're not doing
anything wrong.

17:01.501 --> 17:04.042
What?! You guys
are cuttin' off
each other's dicks

17:04.125 --> 17:07.125
- and fuckin' eating 'em, man.
- So?

17:10.667 --> 17:12.042
Stay down.

17:12.125 --> 17:13.583
It's not illegal.

17:13.667 --> 17:15.583
You're telling me
assault isn't illegal?

17:15.667 --> 17:17.750
- Dan: We have a tape.
- That's right.

17:17.833 --> 17:21.084
I have a recording.
Full consent, both sides.

17:21.167 --> 17:22.875
It's not assault.

17:22.959 --> 17:26.459
- Cannibalism, fucker.
- Not a crime. It's not a crime.

17:26.542 --> 17:27.750
( siren approaches )

17:29.542 --> 17:30.542
Fuck.

17:32.667 --> 17:34.959
- Cop #2: Fuck.
- Cop #3: What happened here?

17:35.042 --> 17:37.459
I think this one
agreed to have
his dick cut off

17:37.542 --> 17:39.667
- so the other one could eat it.
- We split it.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.875
Gene:
But we agreed
on it beforehand.

17:41.959 --> 17:43.292
It's all planned out.

17:43.376 --> 17:44.501
If I may.

17:48.625 --> 17:51.209
Dan ( on recording ):
OK. I, Dan Bender,

17:51.292 --> 17:52.875
am of sound mind

17:52.959 --> 17:55.167
and have previously agreed
to everything that I will do

17:55.251 --> 17:57.583
and that will be
done to me tonight.

18:02.667 --> 18:05.251
- You OK, sir?
- Yeah, man.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.667
You'll need
medical attention
at some point.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.459
Yeah, I got bandages
for now,

18:09.542 --> 18:11.959
so... we prepared.

18:13.417 --> 18:15.376
So what else
happened here tonight?

18:15.459 --> 18:17.792
Uh, she barged in
without a warrant.

18:17.875 --> 18:20.542
'Cause they were doing
some crazy, illegal-ass shit!

18:20.625 --> 18:24.833
It's not illegal!
Jeez, how many times
do we have to tell you?

18:24.917 --> 18:26.792
( whispers )
We didn't have
probable cause.

18:26.875 --> 18:29.251
He cut his dick off.
He cut his dick off.

18:29.334 --> 18:30.708
That's assault.

18:34.125 --> 18:37.708
( entering text on phone )

18:45.334 --> 18:48.209
Cop #3:
It's really not?

18:48.292 --> 18:51.251
It's fucking weird,
but it's not illegal.

18:51.334 --> 18:54.042
And technically,
it's not assault,
with consent.

18:54.125 --> 18:56.959
Which is exactly what
we've been trying to tell her.

18:59.792 --> 19:02.376
Sir, you also OK
with what's happening here?

19:02.459 --> 19:04.501
Up until you guys barged in

19:04.583 --> 19:07.251
and ruined
our lovely evening, sure.

19:10.833 --> 19:14.959
Uh, you'll want to
get that looked at sooner
rather than later.

19:19.875 --> 19:21.792
Sorry for the inconvenience.

19:37.125 --> 19:38.000
Jeez.

19:41.542 --> 19:42.667
( grunts )

19:51.167 --> 19:52.251
( sighs )

19:52.334 --> 19:54.667
( short laugh )

19:54.750 --> 19:56.209
Shall we continue?

19:57.376 --> 19:58.917
We shall.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.542
Bottom drawer.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.875
You OK?

20:20.959 --> 20:22.542
Yeah. I got this.

20:34.084 --> 20:36.501
Do you believe
those police officers?

20:36.583 --> 20:38.501
Who the hell
do they think they are?

20:38.583 --> 20:41.084
Ah, they just
don't understand.

20:41.167 --> 20:43.792
These are our basic
human rights, you know?

20:43.875 --> 20:46.209
I know.
What are we gonna do?

20:46.292 --> 20:48.042
It's not fair.

20:48.125 --> 20:50.917
Hey, I don't want them
to ruin our night.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.792
- You're right.
- OK?

20:53.875 --> 20:56.833
I say we forgive
and forget.

20:56.917 --> 20:59.376
That's very sweet
of you, Dan.

20:59.459 --> 21:02.251
I'm inspired.

21:02.334 --> 21:05.459
Think I'm gonna forgive 'em.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.792
( exhales )
Are you ready?

21:22.875 --> 21:25.750
I'm so  ready.

21:28.334 --> 21:32.000
What do you think
mine's gonna taste like?

21:32.084 --> 21:34.042
If I had to bet,

21:34.125 --> 21:37.209
I would say... delicious.

21:37.292 --> 21:39.542
Delicious.

21:39.625 --> 21:41.501
( chuckles )
Delicious.

21:41.583 --> 21:43.667
I hope you're right.
