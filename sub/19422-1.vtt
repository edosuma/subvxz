01:38.620 --> 01:40.253
Mr. Kramer.

01:40.288 --> 01:41.587
I don't know if you remember me.

01:41.623 --> 01:44.790
I'm Mary Landers,
reporter for The Bugle.

01:44.826 --> 01:46.292
I remember.

01:46.327 --> 01:47.972
Did you happen to see
my article in The Bugle

01:47.996 --> 01:50.930
of the incursion of chipmunks
in Hidden Hollow Park?

01:50.965 --> 01:52.265
Must have missed it.

01:52.300 --> 01:53.866
Well, with my
investigative reporting,

01:53.901 --> 01:56.002
I exposed that the chipmunks
are disturbing

01:56.037 --> 01:59.272
all the biological balance
of all the fauna in the park.

02:00.708 --> 02:03.876
It's true, the squirrels
are really upset.

02:03.911 --> 02:05.645
You interviewed squirrels?

02:05.680 --> 02:08.614
Well, actually, I interviewed
a world renowned behaviorist

02:08.650 --> 02:11.317
from City College
that did confirm that

02:11.352 --> 02:14.820
the squirrels are exhibiting
signs of depression.

02:14.856 --> 02:16.922
It's all in the height
of the tail.

02:19.827 --> 02:21.038
I'd love to come
talk to you about

02:21.062 --> 02:22.862
some articles
I'm thinking about.

02:22.897 --> 02:25.298
Keep up the good work.

02:25.333 --> 02:26.832
Thanks, sir.
Have a great day.

02:29.837 --> 02:32.305
Well, at least he knows who I am.

02:43.451 --> 02:45.351
- Hey, Natalie.
- Good morning.

02:45.386 --> 02:46.664
- Hey, Todd.
- Good morning, Mary.

02:46.688 --> 02:49.488
- Morning, Sharon.
- Hey.

02:49.524 --> 02:52.325
Keeping busy?

02:52.360 --> 02:57.330
Emergency closure on South Temple.
They need to remove a dead tree.

02:57.365 --> 02:59.699
Stop the presses.

02:59.734 --> 03:02.068
What's wrong, Mary?

03:02.103 --> 03:04.537
I can't do this anymore.
I'm going mad.

03:04.572 --> 03:07.740
- What are you talking about?
- I can't write about this anymore.

03:07.775 --> 03:10.776
I can't write about
yard sales and spelling bees.

03:10.812 --> 03:13.012
We all gotta start somewhere.

03:13.047 --> 03:15.681
We've been doing this
for six years now.

03:15.717 --> 03:18.584
Okay? I went to
journalism school.

03:18.619 --> 03:20.353
I hardly think my
professors thought

03:20.388 --> 03:24.623
my big breaking story would be
writing about a sign on Gino's Pizzeria

03:24.659 --> 03:26.370
that's keeping the residents
awake at night.

03:26.394 --> 03:28.627
The neighborhood was
very grateful.

03:28.663 --> 03:32.698
Besides, I thought you were gonna talk
to Jack Kramer over at the Gazette.

03:32.734 --> 03:33.966
I did.

03:34.001 --> 03:35.601
And?

03:35.636 --> 03:37.403
Let's just say he's not
overly impressed with

03:37.438 --> 03:39.538
my investigative reporting
on chipmunks.

03:41.409 --> 03:43.576
It was a story that
needed to be told.

03:45.813 --> 03:50.716
I am dying here.
I feel like I'm standing still.

03:50.752 --> 03:53.652
What do you say we...
we go out tonight?

03:53.688 --> 03:55.388
Have some margaritas.

03:55.423 --> 03:58.891
Who know, maybe we'll get lucky, and
we'll witness a robbery or something.

03:58.926 --> 03:59.937
You'll be off and running.

03:59.961 --> 04:03.396
Can't.
Going out with Carl.

04:03.431 --> 04:06.065
Said he had something
important to tell me.

04:06.100 --> 04:07.767
I bet he's gonna propose.

04:09.604 --> 04:13.806
- You think so?
- Well, I mean, it's been five years.

04:13.841 --> 04:16.575
- And he's not gonna do
better than you. Oh, Connie.

04:16.611 --> 04:19.144
I want you to go talk to the
washroom attendants at The Drake.

04:19.180 --> 04:20.913
They still have
washroom attendants?

04:20.947 --> 04:22.515
Yes, and they're very upset.

04:22.550 --> 04:23.827
Go on, I know you
have it in you.

04:23.851 --> 04:25.351
Make it special.
Mary.

04:29.857 --> 04:32.858
- Yeah, Wally.
- I have a special assignment for you.

04:32.894 --> 04:35.094
- Really?
- This is gonna be front page stuff.

04:35.129 --> 04:38.497
- Really?
- It's for our Valentine's Day issue.

04:38.533 --> 04:39.765
Really.

04:39.801 --> 04:41.600
You look disappointed.

04:41.636 --> 04:43.836
It's just that does the
public really need to know

04:43.871 --> 04:46.539
that candy corn Cupids are gonna
be all the rage at Taffy Town?

04:46.574 --> 04:49.642
No, I'm thinking more of
a meditation on love.

04:49.677 --> 04:52.645
Give me your take on
the true meaning of love.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.625
You want me to write about
the true meaning of love.

04:54.649 --> 04:56.649
In 3,000 words.

04:56.684 --> 04:58.951
- But, Wally, I...
- Go on, I know you have it in you.

04:58.986 --> 05:00.519
Make it special.

05:02.557 --> 05:03.622
Okay.

05:09.897 --> 05:12.631
I don't know why I bother
to look at this menu.

05:12.667 --> 05:17.036
We always order the same thing.
Cheese ravioli for two.

05:18.506 --> 05:23.676
I guess you could call us boring.
Set in our ways. Right, Carl?

05:25.246 --> 05:26.879
Never mind.

05:26.914 --> 05:28.481
Hi.
I know what we want.

05:28.516 --> 05:30.649
We're gonna get the
cheese ravioli, please,

05:30.685 --> 05:33.219
and, I... I would love
a little bit more water.

05:33.254 --> 05:36.655
Actually, I'm gonna have
the chicken risotto.

05:36.691 --> 05:38.991
And, tiramisu
for the lady, please.

05:39.026 --> 05:41.660
Thank you.

05:41.696 --> 05:44.563
- What's going on, Carl?
- What do you mean?

05:44.599 --> 05:46.832
You just ordered
the chicken risotto.

05:46.868 --> 05:49.502
We always get
the cheese ravioli.

05:49.537 --> 05:52.638
Yeah... I think I can explain.

05:55.109 --> 05:56.954
Look, I want to tell you
something that happened last week.

05:56.978 --> 06:00.513
Does this have to do with
the chicken risotto?

06:00.548 --> 06:03.048
In a way, yes.

06:03.084 --> 06:06.519
So, Tim Wood came in.
You know who Tim Wood is, right?

06:06.554 --> 06:10.589
- He's one of your customers?
- Yes, a very good customer.

06:10.625 --> 06:12.591
Every three years
for the last 15 years,

06:12.627 --> 06:14.693
he's leased the same car from me.

06:14.729 --> 06:18.597
A four-door, kid friendly,
brand new navy blue sedan.

06:18.633 --> 06:22.735
Every three years,
same car, same features.

06:22.770 --> 06:24.803
But last Thursday,
you know what he did?

06:24.839 --> 06:26.105
I haven't the slightest idea.

06:26.140 --> 06:29.942
He bought a brand new
convertible sports car.

06:29.977 --> 06:32.711
Just like that, he walked
in and... and just...

06:32.747 --> 06:34.046
and just got a red convertible.

06:36.150 --> 06:38.128
What does this have to do
with the chicken risotto?

06:38.152 --> 06:40.753
It has to do with change, Mary.

06:40.788 --> 06:43.556
It was in that moment,
that very moment,

06:43.591 --> 06:45.124
that Tim Wood bought
that convertible

06:45.159 --> 06:47.293
that I had my
road to Damascus moment.

06:47.328 --> 06:48.894
Road to Damascus?

06:48.930 --> 06:53.232
I remembered then what
my father used to say to me.

06:53.267 --> 06:55.634
If you don't like something,
change it.

06:57.939 --> 07:01.106
Not quite Mark Twain,
but okay, fine.

07:01.142 --> 07:03.175
Get your risotto.

07:03.210 --> 07:05.811
I don't think
you understand, Mary.

07:08.349 --> 07:11.250
I'm sorry, Mary,
I just don't think that

07:11.285 --> 07:14.086
we should see each other
anymore.

07:16.791 --> 07:18.090
Sorry.
What'd you say?

07:18.125 --> 07:20.960
There has to be more to life
than cheese ravioli.

07:20.995 --> 07:23.206
I don't understand, Carl.
We've been together for five years.

07:23.230 --> 07:25.030
You've always loved
cheese ravioli.

07:25.066 --> 07:28.834
I'm bored, Mary. I need...
I need some excitement in my life.

07:28.869 --> 07:30.302
What are you saying, I'm boring?

07:30.338 --> 07:32.338
No, I...

07:32.373 --> 07:35.107
Call me crazy,
but I'd like to date someone

07:35.142 --> 07:36.153
who didn't know what
they want to order

07:36.177 --> 07:37.343
without looking at the menu.

07:37.378 --> 07:40.779
Fine, I'll change my order.
I'll change. Okay?

07:40.815 --> 07:43.115
Where's the waitress?
I'll have the manicotti.

07:43.150 --> 07:45.217
This is bigger than manicotti.

07:45.252 --> 07:48.287
Look, you... you're a great gal.

07:48.322 --> 07:50.956
I just lately
have been thinking that

07:50.992 --> 07:54.126
I need something different,
something less...

07:54.161 --> 07:55.527
predictable.

07:56.397 --> 07:58.130
Predictable?

07:58.165 --> 08:01.734
I just wrote an investigative
piece on depressed chipmunks...

08:01.769 --> 08:04.169
Squirrels. Squirrels.

08:04.205 --> 08:05.971
Don't tell me
that is predictable.

08:06.007 --> 08:08.140
Mary, I need...
I need someone that

08:08.175 --> 08:11.310
when she walks in the room,
I get butterflies in my stomach.

08:11.345 --> 08:13.712
But we live in
the same building, Carl.

08:13.748 --> 08:16.081
Don't you think it would be
awkward if we broke up?

08:16.117 --> 08:17.449
Yeah, you're right about that.

08:19.353 --> 08:21.820
I think you should move.

08:21.856 --> 08:25.324
But it's almost Valentine's Day.

08:25.359 --> 08:26.992
- Here you go.
- It'll...

08:27.028 --> 08:30.195
Hi. We're actually gonna get that
to go, if that's okay. Thanks.

09:32.827 --> 09:35.227
<i>Aviation Way.
Next stop, First Avenue.</i>

09:51.145 --> 09:53.378
Wait!
You forgot your phone.

09:57.885 --> 09:59.485
Sorry.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.254
Shoot.

10:16.804 --> 10:18.804
Excuse me.
I'd like to turn this in.

10:19.874 --> 10:22.341
Lost property, form F2108.

10:22.376 --> 10:24.276
It's not a lost property.
I found this phone,

10:24.311 --> 10:25.489
and I just want to give it back.

10:25.513 --> 10:26.945
Yeah, we don't have
a form for that.

10:26.981 --> 10:28.814
- What do you mean?
- Look, lady,

10:28.849 --> 10:30.282
I work for the transit system.

10:30.317 --> 10:32.184
People don't just turn
property in around here.

10:32.219 --> 10:36.221
- Well, what is all that stuff?
- Every night, we clean the train cars.

10:36.257 --> 10:39.458
And every night we find phones,
keys, baby bottles, you name it.

10:39.493 --> 10:42.928
What can I say? It all ends up...
Here.

10:46.033 --> 10:49.334
You know what?
Never mind.

10:49.370 --> 10:51.503
I'm gonna take the phone
and try to find him myself.

10:56.210 --> 11:00.212
- What's wrong?
- Carl broke up with me.

11:00.247 --> 11:02.147
Yes!

11:02.183 --> 11:05.884
I mean, no, no, no,
that is so bad.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.186
- Man.
- You hated him.

11:07.221 --> 11:11.824
I don't hate him, I just...
I think you can do better.

11:11.859 --> 11:13.158
What happened?

11:13.194 --> 11:15.527
He said he wants
something different.

11:15.563 --> 11:18.497
What am I supposed to do? How am I
supposed to be any different in my life?

11:18.532 --> 11:21.567
Well, you could start with changing
those shoes, they're horrible.

11:21.602 --> 11:26.004
He says I'm predictable.
Am I predictable?

11:26.040 --> 11:28.173
Predictably wonderful.

11:28.209 --> 11:31.076
You're so sweet. You always
say the nicest things to me.

11:31.111 --> 11:34.046
That's because you're
a good person, Mary.

11:34.081 --> 11:37.082
Hey. Hey.
You're a good person.

11:37.117 --> 11:38.550
I am a good person.

11:38.586 --> 11:40.185
- Yeah.
- I am.

11:40.221 --> 11:43.088
I do really nice things
for people, like...

11:43.123 --> 11:46.859
if somebody's checking out,
I'll let them check out

11:46.894 --> 11:49.962
in front of me at the
grocery store with one item.

11:49.997 --> 11:52.865
And I donate all my clothes
to Goodwill.

11:52.900 --> 11:57.135
Connie, she sends me all these
videos, thousands every day,

11:57.171 --> 11:59.371
and I always tell her
thank you for them.

11:59.406 --> 12:00.873
And you probably
don't know this,

12:00.908 --> 12:04.376
but I put nickels on the sidewalk
just so people can find them.

12:04.411 --> 12:07.257
Is that why Mr. Gilbert is always looking
at the ground in front of the building?

12:08.919 --> 12:12.050
Who am I kidding?
Who's gonna fall in love with me?

12:12.086 --> 12:14.253
Really?

12:14.288 --> 12:16.922
Hundreds of guys.
I mean, there's thousands.

12:16.957 --> 12:18.090
Name one.

12:18.125 --> 12:20.959
Okay...
Mr. Vornado.

12:20.995 --> 12:22.561
- My dry cleaner?
- Yeah.

12:22.596 --> 12:23.996
He's always had a thing for you.

12:24.031 --> 12:25.475
No, no, no,
I'm not crossing that line.

12:25.499 --> 12:27.099
He is the best dry cleaner
in the city.

12:27.134 --> 12:29.246
Do you know how hard it is
to find a good dry cleaner?

12:29.270 --> 12:30.614
- I mean, that guy is a genius...
- Fine, fine, fine, fine.

12:30.638 --> 12:32.938
You're never gonna
find love ever again,

12:32.973 --> 12:34.918
and you're just gonna live alone
with cats the rest of your life.

12:34.942 --> 12:36.074
Congratulations.

12:36.110 --> 12:37.943
- Will I?
- Seriously really?

12:37.978 --> 12:39.278
You know what?
Jack Kramer,

12:39.313 --> 12:41.413
he just needs to give me
that job at The Gazette,

12:41.448 --> 12:45.417
and then my life will be changed,
and I will be different.

12:45.452 --> 12:47.419
What, no, no,
what are you doing?

12:47.454 --> 12:49.588
You are not texting the guy
that broke your heart.

12:49.623 --> 12:51.635
- No, no, give me...
- No, relax, it's not... it's not my phone.

12:51.659 --> 12:53.258
This is... I found this
on the subway.

12:53.294 --> 12:55.661
This guy... I just want
to find his contacts

12:55.696 --> 12:58.096
so I can give it back to him.

12:58.132 --> 13:01.266
- The security code.
- Try 1234.

13:05.306 --> 13:07.272
How did you know that?

13:07.308 --> 13:09.975
'Cause it's everybody's
security code.

13:10.010 --> 13:15.147
It says if you find it,
contact James Fielding.

13:15.182 --> 13:17.182
He's on South State Street.

13:17.217 --> 13:19.151
555-0127.
Give me your phone.

13:23.157 --> 13:26.992
Okay.

13:29.596 --> 13:32.464
<i>Hey, it's James. I'm out of the
country, so don't leave a message.</i>

13:32.499 --> 13:34.499
<i>I will see you after
my latest adventure.</i>

13:34.535 --> 13:39.972
My latest adventure?
Who is this guy, Marco Polo?

13:40.007 --> 13:43.308
I mean, look at him. Look.
He dives with sharks.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.644
- Whoa.
- He... He jumps off cliffs.

13:45.679 --> 13:47.980
He runs with...
He runs with the bulls.

13:48.015 --> 13:49.348
This is the perfect guy for you.

13:49.383 --> 13:51.683
Victor, my boyfriend
just broke up with me.

13:51.719 --> 13:53.352
This might be
a crazy idea, but...

13:56.056 --> 13:57.600
do you know who he's
the perfect guy for?

13:57.624 --> 14:00.325
- Who?
- The Gazette.

14:00.361 --> 14:01.593
The Gazette? Wh...

14:01.628 --> 14:05.230
The Gazette is always looking to find
new interesting people to profile.

14:05.265 --> 14:08.200
I could just write a story on him.
That would be a good way in.

14:08.235 --> 14:11.069
Did you not just hear the part
about him being out of the country?

14:12.706 --> 14:16.608
What if he turns out to not
even be an interesting person?

14:18.379 --> 14:20.545
Is that a real lion?

14:20.581 --> 14:22.214
Yeah.

14:26.220 --> 14:27.519
It's Mr. Gilbert.

14:27.554 --> 14:30.390
- What is he doing?
- He's looking for nickels.

14:32.459 --> 14:34.292
Is that my future?

14:34.328 --> 14:35.728
Looking for nickels
in the junipers?

14:38.499 --> 14:41.099
He texted.
What do I do?

14:44.405 --> 14:47.205
You sent an emoji of a pumpkin?

14:47.241 --> 14:48.707
He's gonna think
I'm a total lunatic.

14:48.742 --> 14:51.710
Yeah, or festive.

14:51.745 --> 14:54.446
"Yes, I have your phone".

14:56.450 --> 14:58.083
"Are you the girl
on the train?"

14:58.118 --> 14:59.651
He remembers me.

15:01.121 --> 15:03.422
"The one with the red shoes
eating dessert?"

15:05.292 --> 15:10.262
Please tell me you were not
eating cheesecake in public again.

15:10.297 --> 15:13.231
It was the tiramisu
from Nino's Amore.

15:13.267 --> 15:15.267
I couldn't resist.
Give me your phone.

15:17.204 --> 15:19.571
He says he's in the airport
heading to Paris.

15:19.606 --> 15:21.740
He says he uses it for
international travel.

15:21.775 --> 15:24.443
This guy's like James Bond.

15:24.478 --> 15:26.111
He says he wants to meet me.

15:27.681 --> 15:30.082
What do I say?

15:30.117 --> 15:32.818
"Yes, I can meet you.
When?"

15:32.853 --> 15:36.488
"Back on February 14th".

15:36.523 --> 15:38.256
- Valentine's Day?
- Yeah, what do you care?

15:38.292 --> 15:40.092
You're not gonna be busy.

15:40.127 --> 15:42.427
He wants you to hold
onto his phone until then.

15:42.463 --> 15:45.130
Uh, "where should we meet?"
Question mark.

15:46.533 --> 15:51.369
- "Kimi's, 9 p. m".
- Kimi's, Kimi's. Kimi's?

15:51.405 --> 15:52.838
Yeah, the place
by my old apartment.

15:52.873 --> 15:55.440
Yeah, yeah, I love that place.
Okay.

15:58.312 --> 15:59.845
What are you typing?

15:59.880 --> 16:03.782
I'm asking him if it's okay
if you write a story on him.

16:06.687 --> 16:08.186
What's he saying?

16:08.222 --> 16:10.622
He wants to know
what kind of story.

16:11.592 --> 16:13.492
Okay.

16:13.527 --> 16:16.795
Tell him I'm a very
important reporter

16:16.830 --> 16:19.331
working for an internationally
recognized newspaper,

16:19.366 --> 16:21.666
and I write profiles on
interesting people.

16:23.837 --> 16:27.339
Pretty sure the staff of The Bugle,
circulation 142, is gonna believe that one.

16:27.374 --> 16:30.142
Just type that.

16:32.212 --> 16:35.480
He's saying, "What makes you
think I'm so interesting?"

16:38.685 --> 16:41.186
"Just a hunch.

16:41.221 --> 16:43.722
"I would like to get to know
you better to make sure".

16:43.757 --> 16:45.257
- No.
- Send.

16:45.292 --> 16:47.826
No! Don't send that.
Victor.

16:47.861 --> 16:49.828
That is so embarrassing.

16:49.863 --> 16:52.023
I'm just gonna crawl in a
hole and die of embarrassment.

16:55.536 --> 17:00.505
"You have everyone I know
in your hands. Go for it".

17:04.944 --> 17:06.578
"Go for it"?

17:18.028 --> 17:19.527
Hey, Mom.

17:21.064 --> 17:24.398
- There you are.
- Hi.

17:24.434 --> 17:28.303
You're an hour late.
Hey, where's Carl?

17:28.338 --> 17:31.039
- We broke up.
- I'm sorry.

17:31.678 --> 17:34.909
You career girls, all work
and no time for romance.

17:34.945 --> 17:38.313
- Carl broke up with me, Aunt Pam.
- So, are you seeing anyone new?

17:38.348 --> 17:40.982
It's been less than 24 hours.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.350
Hi, Uncle Bill.
Hi.

17:42.386 --> 17:45.053
She got dumped. She's single.
Still single.

17:46.123 --> 17:47.989
Happy birthday, Dad.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.258
Thank you, sweetheart.

17:55.465 --> 18:00.168
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Why?

18:00.203 --> 18:03.872
Just surprised about
you and Carl, that's all.

18:03.907 --> 18:08.243
You know, I think...
he thinks I'm boring.

18:08.278 --> 18:12.580
- Why, that is ridiculous.
- No, I think he's right.

18:12.616 --> 18:14.449
About being boring?

18:14.484 --> 18:16.351
I think I'm bored.

18:19.222 --> 18:20.922
But I'm gonna do something
to change that.

18:20.957 --> 18:22.357
Like what?

18:22.392 --> 18:24.392
I'm gonna find a great guy.

18:24.428 --> 18:28.363
And then I'm gonna be everything
he wants in a girl and more.

18:28.398 --> 18:31.533
And we're gonna fall
madly in love.

18:31.568 --> 18:35.103
- And then what?
- What do you mean?

18:35.138 --> 18:39.207
You become the girl that this
great guy of yours is looking for,

18:39.242 --> 18:41.042
and then what?

18:41.078 --> 18:44.045
Well, we'll live
happily ever after.

18:45.415 --> 18:50.418
So, this new guy of yours
gets the girl of his dreams.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.990
What, Mom? You're doing
that... that nod, that...

18:56.026 --> 18:57.592
You have that look.

18:57.627 --> 19:03.708
It just seems to me that in your
happily ever after, you lose.

19:04.034 --> 19:06.267
Lose what?

19:06.303 --> 19:08.002
Yourself.

19:08.038 --> 19:12.307
Who you really are, what you
really want, what you really need.

19:14.478 --> 19:18.346
To find real love, Mary,
you have to love yourself first.

19:18.381 --> 19:21.182
It will come to you.

19:21.218 --> 19:24.919
But true love doesn't
fall for disguises.

19:24.955 --> 19:27.088
It sees right through them.

19:27.124 --> 19:33.661
So you just be your authentic,
wonderful self.

19:33.697 --> 19:35.597
And it'll come.

19:35.632 --> 19:38.533
- Now, come on.
- Okay.

19:38.568 --> 19:44.139
- Happy birthday to you...
- Happy birthday to me...

19:44.174 --> 19:48.977
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to me

19:51.414 --> 19:52.480
Good morning, sir.

19:59.089 --> 20:01.556
So what I want to do is I want
to paint a portrait of a man

20:01.591 --> 20:05.960
by interviewing his friends,
family, co-workers, acquaintances,

20:05.996 --> 20:08.530
see him through
the prism of their eyes.

20:08.565 --> 20:12.467
- Sounds like an obit.
- No, no, no, no, no. No.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.068
Well, think of it like
a living obit.

20:14.104 --> 20:17.472
Living obit.
That's original, Landers.

20:17.507 --> 20:20.241
And trust me, sir, this man
who I want to write about

20:20.277 --> 20:23.645
is very much alive.
Very, very much.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.712
Here.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.385
That a real lion?

20:32.022 --> 20:35.657
I think this piece would be really
great in your new millennial section.

20:35.692 --> 20:36.692
What do you think?

20:39.196 --> 20:41.196
Don't you have
another job, Landers?

20:41.231 --> 20:42.997
Yes, I do.
I work for The Bugle.

20:43.033 --> 20:47.001
And I am working on an article
right now on the meaning of love.

20:47.037 --> 20:51.406
Let me guess.
The Valentine's Day issue.

20:53.543 --> 20:55.510
Okay, then, thanks for
your time, sir.

20:55.545 --> 20:57.679
Landers.
Follow me.

21:04.054 --> 21:07.055
Look at that photo.
What do you see?

21:10.060 --> 21:13.027
He didn't have
as much gray hair?

21:13.063 --> 21:16.164
No, look.
Go on, get closer.

21:24.808 --> 21:26.118
I don't know what you
want me to see.

21:26.142 --> 21:28.042
Hunger.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.411
That's what I want you
to see. Hunger.

21:30.447 --> 21:33.448
Look at that guy in that photo.

21:33.483 --> 21:35.750
Does that guy look like he
would take no for an answer?

21:38.255 --> 21:42.557
- I really want to do this story, sir.
- Oh, for cryin' out loud, Landers.

21:42.592 --> 21:44.392
You gotta fight for it.

21:44.427 --> 21:46.594
I really, really
want to do this story, sir,

21:46.630 --> 21:48.730
and prove to you that
I can work at The Gazette.

21:48.765 --> 21:53.468
Jeez Louise, you call that fighting?
Go on, get out of here.

21:53.503 --> 21:55.069
Does that mean
I can do the story?

21:55.105 --> 21:58.573
Yeah, yeah.
Go ahead, write it.

21:58.608 --> 21:59.774
See where it goes.

22:27.537 --> 22:29.804
Thanks again for meeting me.

22:29.839 --> 22:34.842
May I?
Thanks.

22:34.878 --> 22:38.112
So, like I mentioned, I found
your number in James' phone,

22:38.148 --> 22:40.114
and I'm trying to interview
everyone who knows him

22:40.150 --> 22:41.549
to see what kind of man he is.

22:41.584 --> 22:44.118
And does James know
you're doing this?

22:44.154 --> 22:47.455
Yes. In fact,
he told me to go for it.

22:47.490 --> 22:49.857
That does sound like James.

22:49.893 --> 22:53.227
He's a very generous person.
An extraordinary man.

22:53.263 --> 22:57.298
And he has the potential
to be a great tango dancer.

22:57.334 --> 23:00.535
So James is a dancer?

23:00.570 --> 23:03.404
Actually, he's a
photojournalist.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.640
He came here to do
a story about the tango,

23:05.675 --> 23:09.644
and quickly became
enchanted with our world.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.896
So, what makes James
a good dancer?

23:28.932 --> 23:32.734
The tango is a game
of allurement.

23:32.769 --> 23:37.505
It begins in the eyes.
In a glance.

23:37.540 --> 23:43.678
The dance epitomizes the dancer's
loneliness and secret desires.

23:43.713 --> 23:47.615
Tell me, Miss Landers,
have you ever danced the tango?

23:47.650 --> 23:50.518
Me? No, no, no,
I don't dance.

23:50.553 --> 23:54.722
Everyone must dance. Everyone
has a dance inside them.

23:54.758 --> 23:58.426
Honestly, I have two left feet.

23:58.461 --> 24:01.629
I don't... I... Last time I danced
was at my cousin Ronnie's wedding.

24:01.664 --> 24:03.464
We did the line dance
from "Footloose",

24:03.500 --> 24:05.867
and they actually asked me
to leave the dance floor.

24:05.902 --> 24:11.472
Once in your lifetime,
you must dance the tango.

24:11.508 --> 24:14.742
Cesar. Come.

24:14.778 --> 24:16.377
- What?
- Yes. Come, come.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.946
No, I think I should go.
I don't think so.

24:21.851 --> 24:23.551
- Oh, my...
- Don't think.

24:23.586 --> 24:24.786
Just feel.

24:24.821 --> 24:27.722
Oh, my gosh, what is
happening right now?

24:27.757 --> 24:29.257
Just fall into my arms.

24:32.662 --> 24:36.230
Just so you know, I have
a 4:42 train to catch back.

24:36.266 --> 24:37.965
Nothing else matters.

24:38.001 --> 24:40.401
Because tonight...

24:40.437 --> 24:42.603
we have the tango.

24:49.279 --> 24:52.580
Mary, you are
a natural tango dancer.

24:52.615 --> 24:55.750
- I am?
- Goddess.

24:56.986 --> 25:00.321
Powerful.
Graceful.

25:00.356 --> 25:02.790
Beautiful.

25:04.591 --> 25:06.928
Let's tango!

25:25.915 --> 25:28.316
Hey, Carl.

25:35.658 --> 25:39.293
Seriously, Victor,
Carl's face was amazing.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.496
I was doing this tango move
in the elevator,

25:41.531 --> 25:42.975
and the door opens,
he's just standing there,

25:42.999 --> 25:44.732
I'm, like, "Oh, hi, Carl".

25:44.767 --> 25:47.969
And the door closes
before he can say anything.

25:49.032 --> 25:49.837
Oh, man.

25:49.873 --> 25:51.839
Green.

25:51.875 --> 25:53.708
- Pink.
- Thank you.

25:53.743 --> 25:56.644
- So, how was it?
- What?

25:56.679 --> 26:01.749
- Running into Carl again?
- I don't know.

26:01.784 --> 26:04.852
It's strange when you see
someone every day for so long,

26:04.888 --> 26:08.589
and then suddenly you don't.

26:08.625 --> 26:13.694
But it was okay.
I was okay. I think.

26:13.730 --> 26:17.498
I'm not sure I was ever
in love with him, Victor.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.667
I'm not sure
I've ever been in love.

26:19.702 --> 26:23.371
But isn't it funny that Wally's
got me writing this story on love?

26:23.406 --> 26:25.373
I mean, what if I find it?
That will be news.

26:25.408 --> 26:27.842
Especially to me.

26:27.877 --> 26:31.345
- Green.
- Yellow.

26:31.381 --> 26:33.514
Guess what?
I got another lead

26:33.550 --> 26:35.383
- ... with the Gazette story.
- Who?

26:35.418 --> 26:37.552
All I know is
her name is China Howe.

26:37.587 --> 26:39.921
China Howe.

26:39.956 --> 26:41.022
She sounds like a spy.

26:42.392 --> 26:44.759
Look.
Mystery girl.

26:44.794 --> 26:48.529
- Spy.
- Spy.

26:48.565 --> 26:52.600
She said she had a complicated
relationship with him.

26:52.635 --> 26:56.671
- And the plot thickens.
- Yeah, let's hope so.

27:00.579 --> 27:04.147
Quiet down, guys.

27:04.183 --> 27:07.217
- Boy, you have a lot of dogs.
- I know.

27:07.253 --> 27:08.652
You like dogs, right?

27:08.687 --> 27:10.187
I never had a pet growing up,

27:10.222 --> 27:12.856
so honestly, they are...
they scare me a little.

27:12.892 --> 27:16.159
Oh, no, they're not
gonna hurt you.

27:16.195 --> 27:19.563
They're nothin' but love.
Give me a kiss.

27:22.768 --> 27:25.435
Dogs are my life.

27:25.471 --> 27:28.171
You know what?
Dogs saved my life.

27:28.207 --> 27:31.875
- Actually, James saved my life.
- When did you meet?

27:31.911 --> 27:33.410
Five years ago.

27:38.484 --> 27:41.184
Okay, medium rare hamburger.

27:41.220 --> 27:43.587
But I ordered a mushroom omelet.

27:45.557 --> 27:47.190
You... you did.
Okay.

27:47.226 --> 27:49.526
I will fix that.
One second. Okay?

27:50.796 --> 27:51.907
- Where are my...
- Okay, just give me...

27:51.931 --> 27:54.298
Just give me a second.
Okay?

27:54.333 --> 27:57.200
- I ordered a tuna sandwich.
- I'll be right with you.

27:57.236 --> 28:01.371
- What else can I get for you?
- I haven't actually ordered yet.

28:03.242 --> 28:04.586
Just admit it,
I'm a terrible waitress.

28:04.610 --> 28:07.210
No, you're probably
just having a bad day.

28:07.246 --> 28:10.380
No, I'm just really bad at this.

28:10.416 --> 28:15.285
You know what? I hate it.
I dread coming to work.

28:18.757 --> 28:21.825
Tell me something.
Do you know Confucius?

28:21.860 --> 28:23.905
Yeah, he was a regular, and
then I gave him a milkshake,

28:23.929 --> 28:25.774
so now he goes to the
bagel shop down the street.

28:27.066 --> 28:31.435
- You're funny.
- They think I'm a riot.

28:31.470 --> 28:33.437
No, Confucius said,

28:33.472 --> 28:34.816
"The man who finds
a job that he loves

28:34.840 --> 28:37.341
"never works a day in his life".

28:37.376 --> 28:39.443
So, what do you like?

28:39.478 --> 28:40.744
What do I like?

28:40.779 --> 28:44.348
No, no, what do you love
more than anything?

28:44.383 --> 28:46.249
Toast.

28:46.285 --> 28:50.520
Okay, I don't really see a career
path in that, but toast is good.

28:50.556 --> 28:51.788
I like Monopoly.

28:51.824 --> 28:54.858
The yellow properties are the best
because nobody ever lands on them.

28:54.893 --> 28:57.427
- Have you noticed?
- Wow, that's an interesting strategy.

28:57.463 --> 28:59.296
I love dogs.

28:59.331 --> 29:01.832
That's what I love
more than anything.

29:01.867 --> 29:04.634
Am I crazy?

29:06.472 --> 29:09.706
I've gotta get somebody's scrambled
eggs. I'll probably mess it up.

29:09.742 --> 29:11.808
Hard to mess up scrambled eggs.

29:11.844 --> 29:13.810
Watch me.
What can I get for you?

29:13.846 --> 29:18.281
- Cup of coffee would be great.
- Okay, one iced tea coming up.

29:18.317 --> 29:20.017
- China.
- Hot chocolate.

29:22.554 --> 29:24.521
- Really?
- Sorry, Bill.

29:24.556 --> 29:27.891
You said James rescued you.
How did he do that?

29:27.926 --> 29:32.462
He just knows how to see people for
who they really are, and it's enough.

29:32.498 --> 29:34.531
He taps into all those
places in your heart

29:34.566 --> 29:36.500
that we just long to
have touched, you know?

29:52.951 --> 29:56.720
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:59.892 --> 30:02.592
- What happened?
- I got fired.

30:02.628 --> 30:05.495
Something about
messing up a patty melt.

30:05.531 --> 30:08.498
- That's rough.
- It's not the first time.

30:08.534 --> 30:10.834
Yeah.
What are you gonna do?

30:10.869 --> 30:14.538
Find another
crappy waitress job.

30:14.573 --> 30:15.872
By tomorrow.

30:23.048 --> 30:25.682
Come with me. I want
to show you something.

30:25.717 --> 30:26.917
Let me take you somewhere.

30:28.053 --> 30:31.755
That same day, James took me
to a place that changed my life.

30:31.790 --> 30:35.592
Within a week, I had traded in
first acts and scrambled eggs

30:35.627 --> 30:38.361
for something that became
my life's passion.

30:38.397 --> 30:40.730
How do you even know
about this organization?

30:43.135 --> 30:44.734
I had a girlfriend once.

30:45.771 --> 30:47.170
Needed a dog.

30:54.780 --> 30:56.480
Thank you, James.

31:01.620 --> 31:03.720
Why did it end
with the two of you?

31:03.755 --> 31:05.388
Carey.

31:05.424 --> 31:07.557
I think to really
understand James,

31:07.593 --> 31:09.759
you have to know
what happened with Carey.

31:09.795 --> 31:12.095
Who knows? Maybe
if James and I met now

31:12.131 --> 31:14.798
instead of then,
we'd still be together.

31:14.833 --> 31:17.067
Don't get me wrong.
I love him.

31:17.102 --> 31:21.605
I always will. He's the one
who led me to what I love in life,

31:21.640 --> 31:23.940
and really, isn't that
what it's all about?

31:31.450 --> 31:35.118
I can't believe this is all yours.

31:37.656 --> 31:39.990
I couldn't have done it
without James.

31:40.025 --> 31:43.627
He likes you.

31:45.564 --> 31:48.064
You guys are meant to be.

32:02.481 --> 32:03.613
Come on, baby.

32:03.649 --> 32:04.948
- Mary.
- Hey, Carl.

32:04.983 --> 32:05.983
Hi.

32:07.986 --> 32:10.954
- What's wrong?
- Whose dog is this?

32:10.989 --> 32:13.790
This is my new dog.
Boyfriend.

32:13.825 --> 32:15.559
- Boyfriend?
- Say hi to Carl,

32:15.594 --> 32:17.127
my ex-boyfriend.

32:17.162 --> 32:19.863
Hi. Hi.

32:19.898 --> 32:23.633
Okay. I'm really
confused here

32:23.669 --> 32:26.069
because you always said
that you hated dogs.

32:26.104 --> 32:28.471
When we were together,
I always wanted to get a dog,

32:28.507 --> 32:30.018
and you would always say
"Over my dead body".

32:30.042 --> 32:33.143
I'm sorry. Yeah.
What can I say?

32:33.178 --> 32:37.480
Ready to go? Ready to go home?
Okay. Come on.

32:37.516 --> 32:40.684
Come on. Here we go.

32:45.224 --> 32:47.591
Say goodbye to Carl, Boyfriend.

32:48.794 --> 32:50.126
Bye, Boyfriend.

32:59.037 --> 33:00.904
Dad, what are you doing?

33:00.939 --> 33:04.774
It doesn't need
to be so perfect.

33:04.810 --> 33:09.746
This is the way I like it. I like it
just in nice lines, clean, symmetrical,

33:09.781 --> 33:11.748
so it's all going
in the same direction.

33:11.783 --> 33:13.850
They're just leaves, sweetheart.

33:13.885 --> 33:16.253
We sweep them away.
Some blow back.

33:16.288 --> 33:19.689
More fall off the tree, and
then we do it all over again.

33:19.725 --> 33:21.024
Life is messy.

33:21.059 --> 33:24.094
By the way, how's work going?

33:24.129 --> 33:27.230
I'm supposed to be writing a story
on the meaning of love.

33:27.266 --> 33:29.799
You know, in the last few weeks,

33:29.835 --> 33:32.802
I've realized I have no clue
what love means.

33:32.838 --> 33:35.605
Maybe you just need to change
the way you look at things.

33:35.641 --> 33:38.642
35 years ago, my car broke down,

33:38.677 --> 33:41.211
and I went into a dress shop
to answer the phone,

33:41.246 --> 33:43.580
and there was your mother.

33:44.583 --> 33:49.119
Unexpected.
Love is just that way.

33:50.255 --> 33:51.755
Unexpected.

34:07.706 --> 34:09.205
It's from James.

34:10.976 --> 34:14.744
"Greetings from Paris where
it is beautiful and romantic".

34:17.215 --> 34:20.283
Isn't Paris always romantic?

34:33.130 --> 34:34.597
"Ever been"?

34:34.632 --> 34:37.199
No.

34:37.235 --> 34:39.969
I've never left the U.S.

34:42.206 --> 34:43.639
But a girl can dream.

34:56.154 --> 34:58.188
"What's in your dreams?"

35:03.662 --> 35:05.328
God, what is it about this guy

35:05.364 --> 35:07.330
that makes me want
to tell him everything?

35:12.341 --> 35:14.240
James and I worked
in a photo lab.

35:14.276 --> 35:17.177
Back then,
I barely left my house.

35:17.212 --> 35:21.848
I just went to work and came
home and played video games.

35:21.883 --> 35:24.784
Then one day,
James brought me up here.

35:24.820 --> 35:27.988
He told me I needed
to step out of my comfort zone.

35:29.291 --> 35:33.460
The guy showed me how to love life,
and look at me now. Shall we?

35:33.495 --> 35:35.362
I don't think so!
I'm scared!

35:35.397 --> 35:36.997
- Come on!
- I'm just scared of...

35:37.032 --> 35:40.500
- Goggles, goggles.
- Goggles, goggles.

35:40.535 --> 35:42.936
- Hey. Really?
- Yeah.

35:42.971 --> 35:44.337
- Oh, my gosh.
- Come on.

35:44.373 --> 35:46.373
Oh, my gosh.

35:46.408 --> 35:48.475
All right, here I go.

36:01.990 --> 36:04.024
I love James.

36:04.059 --> 36:05.992
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

36:06.028 --> 36:07.193
I don't see him enough.

36:07.229 --> 36:11.297
He's always off somewhere on some
great adventure taking pictures.

36:12.901 --> 36:16.469
- How did you meet James?
- We were neighbors.

36:16.505 --> 36:19.172
You know, back then, we used
to help me around the house...

36:19.207 --> 36:22.142
you know, little things
like carry in the groceries

36:22.177 --> 36:27.614
or fix a broken faucet.
He liked my son Daniel.

36:29.084 --> 36:32.185
When I met James,
Daniel was only 8.

36:32.220 --> 36:36.256
Daniel used to love to play
this old keyboard.

36:36.291 --> 36:39.325
He used to play the same
songs over and over again.

36:40.862 --> 36:42.996
You know, some nights,
when I had to work late,

36:43.031 --> 36:44.497
James would look after Daniel,

36:44.533 --> 36:46.566
and he would listen
to him play this keyboard.

36:46.601 --> 36:48.568
He loved it.

36:48.603 --> 36:54.441
You know, the truth is he saw
something in my child I didn't even see.

36:54.476 --> 36:57.077
One day I came home from work,

36:57.112 --> 37:00.513
and Daniel was sitting
at this beautiful piano.

37:00.549 --> 37:02.515
It was a gift from James.

37:05.387 --> 37:08.121
No one had ever done
anything like that for me.

37:08.156 --> 37:12.392
You know, what kind of man
cares for another's child like that?

37:13.995 --> 37:16.463
James used to sit right here
and watch him play.

37:16.498 --> 37:20.066
And before you knew it,
my child got pretty good.

37:22.938 --> 37:24.871
Okay, now leave
some gaps and spaces

37:24.906 --> 37:26.539
so you can do
something unexpected.

37:30.078 --> 37:31.911
Not quite that unexpected.

37:34.416 --> 37:37.150
- What's wrong, Daniel?
- I can't do it.

37:37.185 --> 37:39.486
- Do what?
- Be great at this.

37:39.521 --> 37:42.122
I want to be the greatest
there ever was.

37:42.157 --> 37:45.892
Do you know who
Ralph Waldo Emerson is?

37:45.927 --> 37:49.963
He was a poet, a writer,
a great writer.

37:49.998 --> 37:51.331
You know what he said?

37:51.366 --> 37:55.068
Nothing great is ever
achieved without enthusiasm.

37:55.103 --> 37:58.638
Show me some enthusiasm. Huh?
Show me some greatness.

38:02.944 --> 38:04.978
That's it.
Now take it from the top.

38:05.013 --> 38:08.081
5, 6, 7, 8! Go! Ha ha!

38:08.116 --> 38:10.316
There you go.

38:15.624 --> 38:18.291
Yeah. Now we're feeling it.

38:20.228 --> 38:24.364
- So where's Daniel now?
- He goes to Julliard.

38:24.399 --> 38:27.300
And next month,
he'll play a concert

38:27.335 --> 38:29.035
- at Carnegie Hall.
- What?

38:30.138 --> 38:32.438
James said he would be there.

38:32.474 --> 38:34.607
Wow. Oh, gosh.

38:34.643 --> 38:36.976
It's just so funny

38:37.012 --> 38:38.212
because I don't even know him,

38:38.246 --> 38:41.948
but everyone in James' life
makes me love him more and more.

38:41.983 --> 38:45.285
- It's crazy, right?
- Not really.

38:45.320 --> 38:47.120
Every day
I just want to hear more

38:47.155 --> 38:50.323
about his acts of kindness,
his sense of adventure,

38:50.358 --> 38:52.125
his total fearlessness.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.661
You know, the one thing
you'll learn about James

38:54.696 --> 38:58.131
is that it all comes from
a place deep in his heart.

38:58.166 --> 39:02.302
And for me, it wasn't
about him buying a piano.

39:02.337 --> 39:06.172
It was about the time that he
spent at this piano with my child.

39:06.208 --> 39:08.641
It's about the groceries
he carried on.

39:08.677 --> 39:12.712
It's about him teaching us the
truth about living a worthwhile life.

39:14.082 --> 39:16.316
That love is everything.

39:26.561 --> 39:28.027
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:29.698 --> 39:32.732
I've separated out
the green ones for you.

39:32.767 --> 39:36.002
This is why I love you.

39:37.372 --> 39:40.673
- You working tonight?
- Valentine's Day sale.

39:40.709 --> 39:44.444
-40% off everything in the store.
- Are the sandals I love on sale?

39:44.479 --> 39:48.281
Literally, the only pair of
shoes in the store not on sale.

39:48.316 --> 39:50.717
How is a girl supposed to live?

39:53.555 --> 39:57.290
- Want to have lunch tomorrow?
- Can't. I'll be out of town.

39:57.325 --> 39:59.425
- What are you doing?
- The James story.

39:59.461 --> 40:01.694
Well, actually, I'm going
to meet this girl Carey,

40:01.730 --> 40:03.696
but the funny thing is,
when I called her,

40:03.732 --> 40:05.531
this guy Matthew
answered her cell phone

40:05.567 --> 40:08.401
and said he'd explain
everything when I got there.

40:11.072 --> 40:14.207
- Alan broke up with Sharon.
- I heard.

40:14.242 --> 40:16.709
The latest bid for the dress
on eBay: 38 bucks.

40:16.745 --> 40:19.379
And Natalie from accounting
is getting married.

40:23.084 --> 40:24.384
You're thinking about Carl.

40:24.419 --> 40:28.721
No. Actually, I'm thinking about
what he said when we broke up.

40:28.757 --> 40:31.557
He said he wants excitement.

40:31.593 --> 40:34.127
He said he wants to feel
butterflies in his stomach

40:34.162 --> 40:35.673
when the girl of his dreams
walks in the room.

40:35.697 --> 40:40.633
Mary, in the last week, you've
jumped out of an airplane,

40:40.669 --> 40:44.237
danced the night away with
some Casanova, and got a dog.

40:45.440 --> 40:47.073
Don't you see?

40:47.108 --> 40:49.342
You're not the girl
that Carl broke up with.

40:49.377 --> 40:51.577
- You've changed.
- I know. Trust me.

40:51.613 --> 40:53.413
No matter how much I've changed,

40:53.448 --> 40:55.092
nobody's going to feel
butterflies when I walk in a room.

40:55.116 --> 40:57.183
You're the one that needs
to feel the butterflies.

40:57.218 --> 41:00.086
All that matters
is what you feel.

41:00.121 --> 41:05.124
And when you feel that
crazy stirring inside you...

41:06.194 --> 41:08.161
you'll know.

41:08.196 --> 41:10.396
You'll know you've finally
found the right one.

41:13.201 --> 41:15.501
Here.
I got you something.

41:16.538 --> 41:18.271
For me?

41:20.342 --> 41:24.110
"For the girl who always picks
out the green candy hearts".

41:24.145 --> 41:26.379
- Aw, thank you.
- Don't get too excited.

41:26.414 --> 41:29.549
Between the 40% off sale and my employee
discount, it was practically free.

41:29.584 --> 41:31.651
Thank you.
You are such a prince.

41:44.833 --> 41:46.299
Thanks for meeting me.

41:46.334 --> 41:48.801
Always happy to help
a fellow journalist.

41:48.837 --> 41:49.802
May I?

41:49.838 --> 41:51.404
- Please.
- Thanks.

41:51.439 --> 41:53.873
So you're a journalist, Matthew?

41:53.908 --> 41:55.141
I'm a nurse,

41:55.176 --> 41:57.210
but I cover Pee Wee football
for the local paper.

41:57.245 --> 41:58.711
Do you work at a hospital?

41:58.747 --> 42:02.181
Center For Brain Injury and
Rehabilitation at Castle Rock.

42:03.184 --> 42:06.319
- And where did you meet James?
- At Castle Rock.

42:06.354 --> 42:09.822
You said on the phone
you haven't seen him for a while.

42:09.858 --> 42:12.191
We text, but I think,
at the end of the day,

42:12.227 --> 42:13.659
it's still just
too painful for him.

42:15.196 --> 42:17.330
James hasn't had
the easiest life.

42:17.365 --> 42:20.533
James' mother was
very devoted to her son.

42:20.568 --> 42:24.704
For Diana Fielding, the son
rose and set on her only child.

42:24.739 --> 42:26.672
Make sure you get glue
all over the heart.

42:26.708 --> 42:28.508
Okay?

42:28.543 --> 42:31.644
- Then the glitter?
- Then the glitter.

42:34.749 --> 42:37.183
Hello. Hey, buddy.

42:37.218 --> 42:39.685
Look at that.
That looks fantastic.

42:39.721 --> 42:42.188
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, babe.

42:42.223 --> 42:43.523
Nice to see you.

42:43.558 --> 42:46.359
I'll make a quick call
and be back.

42:46.394 --> 42:47.727
I'll be right there.

42:49.831 --> 42:52.198
You're doing such
a good job. I love you.

42:52.233 --> 42:54.534
Mama, will we keep this forever?

42:56.271 --> 42:58.404
Every year on Valentine's Day,

42:58.440 --> 43:00.940
we'll put it on the mantel
for everybody to see

43:00.975 --> 43:05.778
because it is the most beautiful
valentine I have ever seen.

43:05.814 --> 43:09.215
And then, when you're all
grown up and you fall in love,

43:09.250 --> 43:10.761
you can give it
to the person you love.

43:10.785 --> 43:12.919
What do you mean?

43:12.954 --> 43:17.623
Well, some day, you're going
to fall in love and get married,

43:17.659 --> 43:20.259
and you'll have your own
traditions, just like we have.

43:23.598 --> 43:25.264
Good job, James.

43:28.503 --> 43:31.604
Let me get some more milk.

43:31.639 --> 43:34.907
- I want to come with you.
- You've got to stay here

43:34.943 --> 43:37.276
and make sure Daddy doesn't
eat all of our cookies.

43:42.283 --> 43:43.416
Daddy's here.

43:43.451 --> 43:46.052
Come sit over here.
Work on your valentine.

43:47.288 --> 43:48.955
I'll be right back. Okay?

43:53.962 --> 43:54.962
James.

43:57.398 --> 43:59.332
I'll love you forever and ever.

43:59.367 --> 44:01.834
Those words,
"forever and ever",

44:01.870 --> 44:03.970
stayed with James
his entire life.

44:36.070 --> 44:38.671
James' mother died instantly,

44:38.706 --> 44:41.641
leaving behind only James
and his father Marshall.

44:41.676 --> 44:44.010
That is so tragic.

44:48.853 --> 44:50.953
Their lives
were forever changed.

44:50.988 --> 44:54.656
James' father Marshall was
a successful businessman.

44:54.692 --> 44:56.658
He worked a lot of long hours,

44:56.694 --> 45:00.863
leaving James home alone to
think about what had been lost.

45:00.898 --> 45:03.165
May I be excused?

45:05.870 --> 45:07.769
Finish your dinner first.

45:59.256 --> 46:02.758
For many months,
James felt very alone.

46:02.793 --> 46:06.194
That was, until he met Carey.

46:44.001 --> 46:46.835
- What's wrong, James?
- Nothing.

46:46.870 --> 46:48.303
Don't you like
making valentines?

46:48.339 --> 46:52.040
That's all right. You don't
have to. We can just sit here.

46:53.777 --> 46:57.446
Besides, I like Easter much
better than Valentine's Day.

46:57.481 --> 46:58.780
Don't you, James?

47:00.451 --> 47:02.918
On Easter I get to wear
my big straw hat

47:02.953 --> 47:05.754
and eat lots
and lots of chocolate

47:05.789 --> 47:09.224
and paint eggs every color
under the rainbow.

47:11.028 --> 47:12.361
Tell me, James.

47:12.396 --> 47:14.096
Tell me you like Easter
best of all.

47:14.131 --> 47:16.798
- Tell me, James.
- I like Easter best of all.

47:16.834 --> 47:21.436
- Louder. I can't hear you.
- I like Easter best of all.

47:21.472 --> 47:24.072
I can't hear you.

47:25.175 --> 47:28.777
I like Easter best of all!

47:28.812 --> 47:31.113
After that day, they were
the best of friends.

47:31.148 --> 47:34.883
- They were rarely apart.
- That's sweet.

47:34.918 --> 47:36.785
Seems like he was
lucky to have her.

47:36.820 --> 47:40.789
You know, I think that's the
wonderful thing about love

47:40.824 --> 47:42.469
because it's just a great
a gift for the giver

47:42.493 --> 47:44.159
as it is for the one
who receives it.

47:49.867 --> 47:53.235
Their lives were never the same.

47:53.270 --> 47:55.337
They went to college together.

47:55.372 --> 47:58.140
Then, after four years,
they moved back into the city,

47:58.175 --> 48:00.308
rented a little house.

48:00.344 --> 48:03.311
I remember James was a portrait
photographer back then,

48:03.347 --> 48:08.350
and Carey used to bake and sell
pies for the local restaurants.

48:08.385 --> 48:13.188
They were very much in love.
They talked about getting married.

48:14.391 --> 48:17.059
And just one day,
everything changed.

48:21.598 --> 48:25.000
- Slow down, Carey!
- Come on, slowpoke!

48:25.035 --> 48:26.001
Here I come!

48:26.036 --> 48:27.903
Only 2 more miles!

48:27.938 --> 48:29.504
Only 2 more miles?
You're killing me.

48:32.030 --> 48:33.875
Come on!

48:33.911 --> 48:36.411
- Come on, James!
- Carey!

48:39.283 --> 48:42.851
Come on, James.
I believe in you.

48:43.933 --> 48:44.986
Carey!

49:00.270 --> 49:02.137
He never left her side.

49:02.172 --> 49:05.907
For the first eight months,
he was there day and night.

49:05.943 --> 49:09.611
But the Carey he knew...
was no longer there.

49:11.615 --> 49:13.215
Come on, Carey.

49:15.252 --> 49:17.452
Tell me you like Easter
best of all.

49:20.023 --> 49:21.890
What?

49:21.925 --> 49:24.459
I can't hear you.

49:24.495 --> 49:27.462
Come on. Tell me you like
Easter best of all.

49:37.608 --> 49:40.308
Tell me you like Easter
best of all.

49:43.547 --> 49:45.413
After a while,
she started to walk again,

49:45.449 --> 49:47.582
but the damage was done.

49:47.618 --> 49:50.152
The doctors said the traumatic
brain injury she suffered

49:50.187 --> 49:51.953
caused retrograde amnesia.

49:54.158 --> 49:57.626
She remembered nothing about
her life before the accident.

50:00.297 --> 50:01.930
I was her nurse.

50:01.965 --> 50:05.200
We worked hard to get
some of her memory back.

50:05.235 --> 50:08.670
But those past memories
only seemed to agitate her.

50:11.408 --> 50:13.608
James was a stranger to her.

50:15.012 --> 50:19.247
After a while, she told him
he didn't need to visit anymore.

50:21.652 --> 50:23.952
So he stayed away
for a few weeks,

50:23.987 --> 50:26.488
but on the day
she was released...

50:38.435 --> 50:39.979
So what's the first thing
you're going to do

50:40.003 --> 50:41.036
when you get out of here?

50:41.071 --> 50:42.437
Go to the movies.

50:43.440 --> 50:45.140
- The movies?
- Yes.

50:45.175 --> 50:47.709
You promised me
when I took my first step

50:47.744 --> 50:49.511
you were going to take me
to the movies.

50:49.546 --> 50:51.146
That I did.

50:51.181 --> 50:54.149
So I'm going to hold you
to that, Matthew McGuire.

50:54.184 --> 50:56.151
It's really the first
thing you want to do?

50:56.186 --> 50:57.485
A scary movie.

50:57.521 --> 51:00.388
Okay. Now I don't know
if I can handle that.

51:00.424 --> 51:03.491
Don't worry.
I'll hold your hand.

51:04.728 --> 51:07.362
Come on, Matthew.
I promise we'll have fun.

51:24.314 --> 51:26.181
On that day...

51:26.216 --> 51:27.649
he let her go.

51:29.152 --> 51:31.152
He loved her that much.

51:32.289 --> 51:34.756
Her just let her go.

51:38.428 --> 51:41.703
After that day, his heart
shattered into a million pieces.

51:42.733 --> 51:45.200
He was fragile for a long time.

51:45.235 --> 51:47.636
But I like to think that James
is the man he is today

51:47.671 --> 51:49.771
because of that broken heart...

51:49.806 --> 51:51.373
never sitting still,

51:51.408 --> 51:54.109
always looking around the corner
for that next adventure.

51:55.746 --> 51:57.779
Running from the pain?

51:57.814 --> 51:59.247
Maybe.

52:01.084 --> 52:04.452
Has there been anyone else
for James since Carey?

52:04.488 --> 52:07.722
No. No one serious.

52:07.758 --> 52:11.059
For a long time, I just
don't think he was ready.

52:11.094 --> 52:15.563
But lately I've noticed
something changing in him.

52:15.599 --> 52:18.099
I mean, call me
an old-fashioned optimist,

52:18.135 --> 52:21.336
but I like to think that
a broken heart can be healed

52:21.371 --> 52:25.473
and that a healed heart can love
deeper and more fully than ever before.

52:28.845 --> 52:30.245
I'm going to show you something.

52:31.615 --> 52:35.183
Here are some photos
that James took recently in Paris.

52:37.621 --> 52:39.187
Maybe it's just me,

52:39.222 --> 52:42.190
but this looks like somebody
who's ready to love again.

52:46.296 --> 52:49.197
Come on. I want you
to meet Carey and our son.

52:49.232 --> 52:51.533
Hey, sport, come here.

52:52.636 --> 52:54.102
- Hey.
- Look at him.

52:54.137 --> 52:55.837
He's a good-looking kid, right?

52:55.872 --> 52:58.273
- How's the soccer going?
- Great.

52:59.309 --> 53:00.775
- Come on.
- Hey.

53:00.811 --> 53:02.177
- Hello.
- Hello.

53:04.514 --> 53:06.354
All right, let's see
what you've been learning.

53:07.484 --> 53:11.152
Okay, Bobby.
Nice kick.

53:13.293 --> 53:15.460
I guess I haven't been
much help with your story.

53:17.464 --> 53:19.431
We have a saying with writers:

53:19.466 --> 53:22.267
what you leave out is as
important as what you leave in.

53:22.302 --> 53:24.769
Well, in my case, I didn't
choose what to leave out.

53:26.039 --> 53:27.806
It was just taken from me.

53:30.877 --> 53:33.478
People tell me...

53:33.513 --> 53:35.613
James and I were close once.

53:37.584 --> 53:39.317
I suppose it's true.

53:41.989 --> 53:44.889
Sometimes,
really late at night...

53:44.925 --> 53:46.624
or early in the morning,

53:46.660 --> 53:48.326
I get this...

53:49.930 --> 53:52.797
I get this sense
of... of something...

53:55.369 --> 53:56.801
something...

53:59.339 --> 54:03.541
like I have this one
brief memory

54:03.577 --> 54:05.844
of a Valentine's Day with James.

54:07.347 --> 54:10.682
I woke up
really early that morning,

54:10.717 --> 54:14.052
and James had made me
pancakes and coffee.

54:17.391 --> 54:21.659
And there on the mantel
was a homemade valentine

54:21.695 --> 54:25.730
with lots and lots
of red glitter all over it.

54:25.766 --> 54:27.832
It was like a child had made it.

54:27.868 --> 54:32.504
And on the valentine
were the words

54:32.539 --> 54:36.374
"I will always love you
forever and ever".

54:36.410 --> 54:38.076
And I remember I...

54:38.111 --> 54:40.879
I really liked it

54:40.914 --> 54:44.082
because it felt so special,

54:44.117 --> 54:46.484
so important.

54:49.790 --> 54:52.157
But then I don't remember
anything else.

54:53.560 --> 54:55.060
I just don't remember.

55:11.745 --> 55:13.711
It's just a sample of
how the piece is going.

55:13.747 --> 55:15.780
I mean, obviously, I have
a lot more work to do,

55:15.816 --> 55:18.716
but I think it captures
the essence of...

55:18.752 --> 55:19.918
Sorry.

55:21.455 --> 55:23.054
The meaning of love.

55:23.090 --> 55:27.592
Mary, I feel your heart
isn't in this one.

55:29.429 --> 55:30.595
That's not true.

55:30.630 --> 55:32.730
Mary, do you remember

55:32.766 --> 55:35.633
when Natalie in accounting
cried over that article you wrote

55:35.669 --> 55:38.103
about the beauty contestant
with the broken leg?

55:38.138 --> 55:40.071
Everybody liked that one.

55:40.107 --> 55:43.575
Well, her talent was tap-dancing.
It wrote itself.

55:46.113 --> 55:50.782
But what we need to find here
is a little heart.

55:52.052 --> 55:54.452
Ask yourself this.

55:54.488 --> 55:55.920
What is it about love

55:55.956 --> 55:58.957
that unlocks the mysteries
of the human heart?

56:03.964 --> 56:07.599
I want to tell you a story,
a story about love.

56:07.634 --> 56:09.567
Please, take a seat.

56:20.580 --> 56:25.617
Once, long ago,
when I was about your age,

56:25.652 --> 56:27.785
I had two girlfriends.

56:27.821 --> 56:29.721
Wally.

56:29.756 --> 56:31.623
Yes, it's true.

56:31.658 --> 56:35.793
One you know:
my lovely wife Ann.

56:35.829 --> 56:38.696
But there was this
terrific girl Barbara

56:38.732 --> 56:40.698
who I was also seeing
at the same time.

56:41.835 --> 56:43.635
And on one Valentine's Day,

56:43.670 --> 56:46.838
Barbara came over
and gave me a gift.

56:46.873 --> 56:50.208
It was a very expensive
cashmere sweater.

56:50.243 --> 56:55.046
And she wanted me to wear it
to her parents' house that night.

56:55.081 --> 56:58.883
But I knew I could
never wear that sweater.

56:58.919 --> 57:04.556
- Why? You didn't like it?
- No. It was a lovely sweater.

57:04.591 --> 57:08.826
But it wasn't really for me.
It was for Barbara...

57:08.862 --> 57:11.129
to make her feel
better about herself.

57:12.199 --> 57:16.201
Later that same day,
my beautiful Ann came over

57:16.236 --> 57:21.039
with a plate of homemade
cookies, just like these.

57:21.074 --> 57:24.175
And you know,
it was at that moment

57:24.211 --> 57:28.613
that I really understood
the true meaning of love.

57:28.648 --> 57:32.116
It was a girl who put
so much care and love

57:32.152 --> 57:34.519
into what she did for me

57:34.554 --> 57:38.957
that I could finally
understand this simple truth.

57:38.992 --> 57:41.025
At the end of the day,

57:41.061 --> 57:45.897
what gives our lives meaning
is how we are loved.

57:50.003 --> 57:52.870
You need to tell your story, Mary.

57:52.906 --> 57:58.109
Tell a story about how someone
or something changed your life

57:58.144 --> 58:03.681
and made you reject that cashmere
sweater for something much more.

58:05.852 --> 58:07.218
Please help yourself.

58:09.322 --> 58:10.588
Thanks.

58:15.028 --> 58:16.561
Amazing.

58:16.596 --> 58:18.596
You married her
after eating these cookies?

58:18.632 --> 58:21.899
I know.
She can't cook a lick.

58:21.935 --> 58:24.769
But boy, she loves me
like no other.

58:39.819 --> 58:41.753
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

58:49.129 --> 58:51.596
I just love this smell.

58:51.631 --> 58:54.866
Well, you've spent more than
one Saturday afternoon in here

58:54.901 --> 58:56.100
playing with your dolls.

58:57.971 --> 58:59.103
Is this for Mom?

58:59.139 --> 59:03.608
My valentine,
always and forever.

59:03.643 --> 59:06.611
Hand me that piece of glass
there, will you?

59:08.982 --> 59:10.782
Thank you.

59:14.988 --> 59:17.955
Careful. That flower's
older than you are.

59:17.991 --> 59:19.957
Really?

59:19.993 --> 59:22.827
Remember I told you
how I met your mother that day.

59:22.862 --> 59:24.028
My car broke down?

59:24.064 --> 59:27.832
Well, that day,
she gave me this flower.

59:27.867 --> 59:29.167
She gave you a flower?

59:29.202 --> 59:33.304
Your mother was never the shy,
retiring type, not then, not now.

59:33.340 --> 59:37.308
She saw something she wanted,
she went after it.

59:37.344 --> 59:40.078
I was lucky my car
broke down that day,

59:40.113 --> 59:42.980
and I was really lucky
that she liked what she saw

59:43.016 --> 59:45.850
when I walked
into that dress shop.

59:45.885 --> 59:48.252
Dad, you're going
to make me cry.

59:51.057 --> 59:53.358
What is that song?

59:53.393 --> 59:56.027
I love that song.

59:57.130 --> 01:00:00.331
We used to dance to this
when you were about that high.

01:00:00.367 --> 01:00:04.869
You put your little feet
on top of mine, and off we'd go.

01:00:04.904 --> 01:00:08.206
- Dad, you want to do that again?
- Sure.

01:00:14.714 --> 01:00:16.247
Now be light on your feet.

01:00:49.117 --> 01:00:50.584
Here we go, got it...

01:00:50.619 --> 01:00:52.719
Hey, Mary.

01:00:52.754 --> 01:00:55.021
Hey.

01:00:55.057 --> 01:00:59.359
Excuse me, I need to...
Yeah, thanks.

01:01:04.233 --> 01:01:07.067
Mary, wait,
this isn't your floor. Wha...

01:01:12.341 --> 01:01:14.574
Don't need any of these anymore.

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:21.214
Time to move on.

01:01:24.786 --> 01:01:27.254
Clearly, you're my
only boyfriend.

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.686
Goodnight, boyfriend.

01:03:16.732 --> 01:03:18.631
Butterflies.

01:03:29.078 --> 01:03:31.111
I see you're enjoying
James's photography.

01:03:31.146 --> 01:03:32.346
Yes, very much.

01:03:32.381 --> 01:03:33.881
He is a very talented young man.

01:03:33.916 --> 01:03:36.116
That's taken from
a series in Africa.

01:03:36.151 --> 01:03:38.685
He travels the globe and
he always comes back with

01:03:38.721 --> 01:03:41.889
the most wonderful images.

01:03:41.924 --> 01:03:43.690
Here is when he was
driving through

01:03:43.726 --> 01:03:45.759
the Masai national reserve.

01:03:45.794 --> 01:03:49.196
Notice how the color here depends
heavily on the angle of the sun

01:03:49.231 --> 01:03:51.331
and the perspective
of the photographer.

01:03:53.736 --> 01:03:55.135
He took this in Paris.

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:56.136
You're familiar with
this photograph?

01:03:56.171 --> 01:03:57.738
Yes.

01:03:57.773 --> 01:03:59.706
A friend of James'
showed me this recently.

01:03:59.742 --> 01:04:03.210
It's one of my favorites.
It's entitled, "Hopeful".

01:04:03.245 --> 01:04:06.280
Would you like to see
some new works from James?

01:04:06.315 --> 01:04:07.748
Sure.

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:21.228
This one's called,
"Girl with Red Shoes".

01:04:27.303 --> 01:04:30.470
Perhaps it should
be called "Hopeful".

01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:57.764
Well, to answer your question,

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:01.134
I spent 35 years
in corporate America.

01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:02.869
I missed seeing my son grow up.

01:05:02.905 --> 01:05:06.039
So when I finally retired,
I discovered my passion.

01:05:06.075 --> 01:05:10.277
I like to get on my hog,
and hit the highway.

01:05:10.312 --> 01:05:12.479
You know, just ride.

01:05:12.514 --> 01:05:15.315
And I found out that it
was a fantastic way

01:05:15.351 --> 01:05:17.517
for me to bond with my son,

01:05:17.553 --> 01:05:18.885
because James
loves to adventure.

01:05:18.921 --> 01:05:20.298
I love adventure,
so on the weekends,

01:05:20.322 --> 01:05:23.123
we take our bikes out,
and we ride.

01:05:23.158 --> 01:05:26.059
We ride for hours.

01:05:26.095 --> 01:05:29.296
And its a great way
for us to catch up.

01:05:32.267 --> 01:05:35.502
Do you regret the years you
missed watching him grow up?

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:43.210
Once, when James was, like, 20,

01:05:43.245 --> 01:05:47.247
and I'd been absent for years,
I called him one night.

01:05:47.282 --> 01:05:51.184
I was sick, I had a fever,
some kind of a flu,

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:53.820
and I needed someone to come
over and take care of me.

01:05:53.856 --> 01:05:55.055
He showed up.

01:05:57.226 --> 01:05:59.926
Wow, you don't look so good.

01:06:10.539 --> 01:06:11.905
All right.

01:06:15.110 --> 01:06:17.477
And that was the night that
everything finally made sense.

01:06:23.986 --> 01:06:25.852
There you go.

01:06:25.888 --> 01:06:27.187
Drink up.

01:06:27.222 --> 01:06:31.091
That he had real faith
in our future together.

01:06:34.163 --> 01:06:36.396
Well... it touched me.

01:06:37.399 --> 01:06:40.567
It touched me immeasurably.

01:06:43.639 --> 01:06:46.039
And so to answer
your question, no.

01:06:46.075 --> 01:06:49.076
No regrets, but...

01:06:49.111 --> 01:06:50.610
Lessons learned.

01:07:04.293 --> 01:07:05.392
You're a natural.

01:07:07.463 --> 01:07:09.096
Here we go.

01:07:09.131 --> 01:07:13.300
- That was fun.
- It was a great time. Great ride.

01:07:17.673 --> 01:07:20.240
Next weekend?

01:07:20.275 --> 01:07:22.909
- Sound good. Night.
- Goodnight.

01:07:22.945 --> 01:07:25.078
- Thank you.
- You bet.

01:07:25.114 --> 01:07:27.180
Hi, Carl.

01:07:27.216 --> 01:07:28.982
Really?
A motorcycle?

01:08:09.627 --> 01:08:12.261
Nothing.

01:08:12.296 --> 01:08:14.764
Hey.

01:08:14.799 --> 01:08:16.198
Don't you just love this place?

01:08:16.234 --> 01:08:17.666
Well, um...

01:08:17.702 --> 01:08:20.136
I suppose.

01:08:20.171 --> 01:08:23.205
Look at this sea urchin,
it is so tender.

01:08:23.241 --> 01:08:25.941
Naw. No.

01:08:25.977 --> 01:08:29.779
What happened to your love
of cheese ravioli? I'm good.

01:08:29.814 --> 01:08:31.613
Well...

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:35.618
like you, I had my
Road to Damascus moment.

01:08:37.721 --> 01:08:39.622
Say, did you hear that Tim Wood

01:08:39.657 --> 01:08:41.624
returned that red convertible
I sold him?

01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:42.725
No.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:44.292
Yeah, he said, he said

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:47.729
"I don't know what I was thinking
I'm a blue sedan guy".

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.698
Mary, you can't... No, I'm good.

01:08:50.734 --> 01:08:52.635
You can't imagine
the amount of paperwork

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:55.837
I generated to return that car.

01:08:55.872 --> 01:08:59.642
Let me tell you, we're talking
loads and loads of forms.

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:07.850
First I've ever had to return.

01:09:07.885 --> 01:09:11.220
Although this one time I did
have a customer,

01:09:11.255 --> 01:09:12.822
Garfield, I think
was his name. He...

01:09:12.857 --> 01:09:15.024
- Carl?
- Yeah?

01:09:15.059 --> 01:09:17.893
I used to have dreams about us.

01:09:17.929 --> 01:09:21.330
I had so many ideas of
what our future would be like.

01:09:21.365 --> 01:09:26.335
But knowing what I know now,
and knowing who I am now,

01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:30.773
I just, I just can't figure out
what that future would be like.

01:09:30.808 --> 01:09:33.676
What are you saying, Mary?

01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:35.411
Is it, is it over between us?

01:09:35.446 --> 01:09:37.011
- Yes.
- I mean, like, really?

01:09:39.450 --> 01:09:40.894
I guess this means you're going to want
me to move out of the building now, right?

01:09:40.917 --> 01:09:43.185
No.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.889
It's okay for you to stay
right where you are.

01:09:48.326 --> 01:09:51.160
The end.

01:09:52.830 --> 01:09:54.363
Night, Mary.

01:09:54.398 --> 01:09:55.865
Leaving?

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.868
- Yeah.
- Where you heading?

01:09:58.903 --> 01:10:02.037
I'm getting ready to spend
another Valentine's day alone.

01:10:02.073 --> 01:10:03.806
You?

01:10:03.841 --> 01:10:07.309
- You seem surprised.
- Well, I am.

01:10:07.345 --> 01:10:13.048
It's been the same thing
year after year.

01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:16.719
I think the last time I got a
valentine was in the third grade.

01:10:21.759 --> 01:10:23.025
Night, Mary.

01:10:24.428 --> 01:10:25.928
Wait.

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:34.937
Happy Valentine's Day, Connie.

01:10:34.972 --> 01:10:38.540
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:43.212
Happy Valentine's Day, Mary.

01:10:55.727 --> 01:10:57.860
I love those balloons.

01:10:57.896 --> 01:11:00.363
Can you believe tomorrow's
Valentine's Day?

01:11:00.398 --> 01:11:02.431
Tomorrow, I meet James.

01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:04.400
You nervous?

01:11:04.435 --> 01:11:06.369
- A little.
- Don't be.

01:11:06.404 --> 01:11:08.704
He's gonna love you and
he's gonna love the article

01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:10.773
you wrote about him
for the Gazette.

01:11:10.808 --> 01:11:12.775
Didn't I tell you?
I wrote it for the Bugle.

01:11:14.946 --> 01:11:18.881
Finding the phone on
the train changed my life.

01:11:18.917 --> 01:11:23.386
I realize I was only with Carl
because it was comfortable.

01:11:23.421 --> 01:11:25.888
And everyone expected Carl
and I to be together,

01:11:25.924 --> 01:11:29.058
to get engaged, to get
married, to have children,

01:11:29.093 --> 01:11:32.762
and I just figured since it
was expected, it was right.

01:11:32.797 --> 01:11:35.097
Don't get me wrong, I like Carl.

01:11:35.133 --> 01:11:38.467
But, it wasn't love.

01:11:38.503 --> 01:11:41.504
Love isn't always comfortable.

01:11:41.539 --> 01:11:44.106
It sneaks up on you.

01:11:44.142 --> 01:11:47.777
Sometimes when you're
not even looking.

01:11:47.812 --> 01:11:51.480
It's unexpected, like
what my dad said.

01:11:51.516 --> 01:11:53.015
Speaking of unexpected,

01:11:53.051 --> 01:11:54.817
did you know that Connie
at your office

01:11:54.852 --> 01:11:57.753
told everyone on Facebook
that you gave her a valentine?

01:11:57.789 --> 01:11:59.922
Box of chocolates.

01:11:59.958 --> 01:12:02.758
You gave her
the box of chocolates?

01:12:02.794 --> 01:12:05.094
I was really looking
forward to that nougat.

01:12:06.631 --> 01:12:08.531
Seeing how James lived his life

01:12:08.566 --> 01:12:10.600
made me want to
live mine differently.

01:12:10.635 --> 01:12:14.537
I don't want to be comfortable.
I want something...

01:12:14.572 --> 01:12:18.140
- Unexpected?
- Unexpected. Yes.

01:12:21.079 --> 01:12:23.646
Is that the Bugle?

01:12:27.819 --> 01:12:31.454
"And love is opening our
hearts to any possibility,

01:12:31.489 --> 01:12:34.256
no matter how unexpected".

01:12:36.561 --> 01:12:39.462
Oh, man, I wish I would've
found a phone on a train.

01:12:42.667 --> 01:12:44.967
- I'm proud of you.
- You're proud of me?

01:12:47.705 --> 01:12:52.975
Someone said to go for it, and
you dove in and you went for it.

01:12:54.512 --> 01:12:55.711
Thanks.

01:12:55.747 --> 01:12:57.480
Was it finding the phone?

01:12:57.515 --> 01:13:00.116
I think it was the butterflies.

01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:07.890
That was a close one.

01:13:07.925 --> 01:13:10.159
What are you
doing here, Landers?

01:13:10.194 --> 01:13:11.527
Shouldn't you be in the park

01:13:11.562 --> 01:13:13.829
chasing a squirrel
for an exclusive?

01:13:13.865 --> 01:13:16.866
Did you happen to read my
article on the meaning of love?

01:13:18.088 --> 01:13:20.936
- I did.
- What did you think?

01:13:20.972 --> 01:13:24.073
Don't take this the wrong
way, but I hate your style.

01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:27.076
How could I possibly take
that the wrong way?

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:28.844
Just too rainbows
and fluffy clouds

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.613
and cinnamon scones
for my taste.

01:13:30.648 --> 01:13:32.848
You know, all that
touchy-feely crap.

01:13:32.884 --> 01:13:36.185
Okay, so you hate touchy-feely.

01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:39.855
That would be incorrect.
I loathe touchy-feely.

01:13:39.891 --> 01:13:42.725
You hated my article that much?

01:13:45.129 --> 01:13:47.530
Come on, Landers,
I didn't say that.

01:13:47.565 --> 01:13:51.701
The whole things works. It's the
kind of thing readers will eat up.

01:13:51.736 --> 01:13:53.869
Sid Kaplan at my feature desk...

01:13:53.905 --> 01:13:56.005
is moving to Florida.

01:13:57.275 --> 01:13:59.275
Are you offering me a job?

01:14:02.613 --> 01:14:03.979
Did I say that?

01:14:04.015 --> 01:14:07.750
Yes, you did.
You're offering me a job.

01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:23.132
What do you think?

01:14:23.167 --> 01:14:24.834
The woman who sold me this

01:14:24.869 --> 01:14:27.570
said that I look like
a strong, independent woman.

01:14:27.605 --> 01:14:30.239
You look like a strong
independent woman

01:14:30.274 --> 01:14:33.943
who ripped down her drapes
and cut out a dress.

01:14:33.978 --> 01:14:36.746
It's 8:35.
You're gonna be late.

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:45.287
- It's effortless.
- No, absolutely not.

01:14:45.323 --> 01:14:47.089
Why?

01:14:47.125 --> 01:14:49.592
You can't wear ripped jeans
on the first date, babe.

01:14:49.627 --> 01:14:51.260
It's technically
not a first date.

01:14:51.295 --> 01:14:53.896
It's a date.

01:14:57.201 --> 01:14:59.101
Please tell me this works.

01:14:59.137 --> 01:15:01.804
You look...

01:15:01.839 --> 01:15:03.172
perfect.

01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:04.207
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:15:04.242 --> 01:15:05.975
Yes.

01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:07.777
It's 8:44, you gotta go.

01:15:07.812 --> 01:15:09.311
- I have to go.
- Bye.

01:15:10.748 --> 01:15:13.315
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

01:15:19.991 --> 01:15:23.325
Hi, I'm going to Kim's
on Third and Temple.

01:15:23.361 --> 01:15:25.628
Can we hurry? I'm sorry,
I'm already running late.

01:15:25.663 --> 01:15:27.263
Thank you.

01:15:37.008 --> 01:15:38.707
Can you go any faster?

01:15:59.030 --> 01:16:00.329
I'm so late!

01:16:01.365 --> 01:16:02.998
All right, you know what?

01:16:03.034 --> 01:16:04.934
I think I'm just gonna get out

01:16:04.969 --> 01:16:06.289
and run the rest of
the way there.

01:16:49.484 --> 01:16:52.318
Oh no, I'm too late.
I missed him.

01:17:00.395 --> 01:17:01.761
Excuse me.

01:17:03.932 --> 01:17:05.899
Where is the guy
that was sitting there?

01:17:05.934 --> 01:17:08.535
I don't know, lady, we get
a lot of people in here.

01:17:08.570 --> 01:17:10.537
Think.

01:17:10.572 --> 01:17:12.972
What happened to him,
where did he go?

01:17:15.343 --> 01:17:19.345
There was some guy there.
I don't know where he went.

01:17:19.381 --> 01:17:21.347
What did he look like?

01:17:21.383 --> 01:17:25.385
- He was wearing pants.
- Wearing pants?

01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:28.721
Was he handsome, did he have
really pretty blue eyes?

01:17:28.757 --> 01:17:30.824
- I don't remember.
- Don't remember?

01:17:33.361 --> 01:17:37.330
Listen, that guy is
the reason that I found myself.

01:17:37.365 --> 01:17:40.300
Before I met him, I lived
a life of caution.

01:17:40.335 --> 01:17:42.435
Always second guessing
everything.

01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:45.071
I was a girl whose idea
of a fun, wild night

01:17:45.106 --> 01:17:47.941
was sneaking a wine cooler into
a 4 P.M. showing of "Eat Pray Love".

01:17:47.976 --> 01:17:53.313
- I love Julia Roberts.
- Everybody loves Julia Roberts.

01:17:53.348 --> 01:17:57.483
My point is, because of
that amazing, handsome,

01:17:57.519 --> 01:18:00.320
loving, generous, kind man,

01:18:00.355 --> 01:18:03.823
I dance the tango.
I jumped out of an airplane,

01:18:03.859 --> 01:18:05.825
and I got a dog.

01:18:07.762 --> 01:18:10.797
Oh, geez.

01:18:10.832 --> 01:18:14.667
You just let him walk out the
door and walk out of my life.

01:18:14.703 --> 01:18:17.403
This is all my fault.

01:18:17.439 --> 01:18:21.641
- You know what my problem is?
- You like to talk to strangers?

01:18:21.676 --> 01:18:23.443
Don't you get it?

01:18:23.478 --> 01:18:26.679
After all that searching for
the story of James Fielding,

01:18:26.715 --> 01:18:29.349
the story I actually
found was my own.

01:18:29.384 --> 01:18:30.950
I found myself,
I found my strength,

01:18:30.986 --> 01:18:33.920
I found my happiness.
And I found the man for me.

01:18:33.955 --> 01:18:35.421
Lady, are you gonna
order something?

01:18:35.457 --> 01:18:38.491
I know what you're gonna say.

01:18:38.526 --> 01:18:41.127
James Fielding doesn't
even know you exist.

01:18:41.162 --> 01:18:45.498
What's wrong with Carl?
Carl wants you back.

01:18:45.533 --> 01:18:47.634
I should've just gone
back to Carl.

01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:50.003
Carl is the place to go, right?

01:18:50.038 --> 01:18:53.706
- I don't know a Carl, sorry.
- I don't want Carl!

01:18:53.742 --> 01:18:56.776
Okay, lady, please don't cry.

01:18:56.811 --> 01:19:00.146
The truth is,
I've fallen in love,

01:19:00.181 --> 01:19:02.482
and found out sometimes
you fall in love

01:19:02.517 --> 01:19:07.887
with the most unexpected person,
at the most unexpected time,

01:19:07.923 --> 01:19:10.623
and you do the most
unexpected things.

01:19:10.659 --> 01:19:12.725
You know what I mean?

01:19:12.761 --> 01:19:15.395
I mean, I already have a
girlfriend, her name's Marisol,

01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:17.997
and she's really jealous.

01:19:18.033 --> 01:19:19.076
So I really don't
want any trouble.

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:21.000
You know, at the end of the day,

01:19:21.036 --> 01:19:24.537
I've come all this way,
and I've finally found myself.

01:19:24.572 --> 01:19:27.507
And I'm left with the
scariest part of my journey.

01:19:27.542 --> 01:19:30.543
Am I bold enough?
Am I brave enough?

01:19:30.578 --> 01:19:32.845
Am I crazy enough
to fall in love?

01:19:32.881 --> 01:19:35.615
I think we're both crazy enough.

01:19:58.139 --> 01:20:00.573
Valentine's day is almost over.

01:20:00.608 --> 01:20:03.576
No, we still have
10 more minutes.

01:20:04.946 --> 01:20:08.748
- I have a present for you.
- For me?

01:20:12.921 --> 01:20:17.590
It's what I've always wanted.

01:20:17.625 --> 01:20:18.925
Take a look.

01:20:35.143 --> 01:20:37.510
I have something for you, too.

01:20:38.913 --> 01:20:40.446
Close your eyes.

01:20:44.719 --> 01:20:45.885
Okay, open.

01:20:55.964 --> 01:20:57.530
Happy Valentine's Day.

01:20:59.768 --> 01:21:02.969
Happy Valentine's Day.

01:21:03.004 --> 01:21:06.539
You asked me a while
ago what was in my dreams.

01:21:09.944 --> 01:21:12.178
I think it was this.
