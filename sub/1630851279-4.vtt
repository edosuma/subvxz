WEBVTT

00:00.600 --> 00:03.102
[gasps] [screams] Yay!

00:11.411 --> 00:12.611
Hi Mom!

00:12.645 --> 00:13.746
What'd you think?

00:14.280 --> 00:15.381
- Not the one?
- No.

00:17.717 --> 00:18.784
I know you haven't seen it
in a while.

00:18.818 --> 00:23.555
I've had one fitting but
the dress didn't fit me well.

00:23.590 --> 00:26.558
So I really hope
the second one turns out okay.

00:26.593 --> 00:29.395
I do feel like it still needs
to be dropped.

00:34.501 --> 00:35.634
[exclaiming]

00:35.668 --> 00:40.672
My biggest concern is
getting my ladies into a dress.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.475
I just don't want to look like a
hoochie mama walking down the aisle.

00:43.510 --> 00:45.577
[grunting]

00:45.612 --> 00:47.913
Having big boobs, it is a...

00:48.548 --> 00:51.350
Uh... The struggle is real.

00:51.384 --> 00:54.119
Am I gonna find anything here?

01:04.664 --> 01:07.900
Huda, it's all about you, girl.

01:08.435 --> 01:09.868
We're going to New York.

01:09.903 --> 01:13.405
Are you ready to take this road trip
so you can "Say yes to the dress".

01:19.913 --> 01:23.348
[computer voice]<i> Stay close for
taking temperature. Normal temperature.</i>

01:23.383 --> 01:24.950
Yes! Ready to rock!

01:24.984 --> 01:25.584
Ready? Let's go!

01:25.618 --> 01:27.686
Oh, my God. It's so amazing.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.521
<i>We're here at Kleinfeld and</i>

01:29.556 --> 01:31.790
<i>I've watched the show
so many times.</i>

01:31.825 --> 01:35.127
<i>And to be here, I just...
I'm so overwhelmed.</i>

01:35.161 --> 01:37.262
<i>So many pretty dresses. I
don't know what I'm gonna do.</i>

01:37.297 --> 01:38.697
[laughing]

01:38.731 --> 01:39.631
[Priscilla] I... I like this.

01:39.666 --> 01:41.700
Pretty. I don't know
if it's for me.

01:41.734 --> 01:43.569
Mom, how do you feel about
not white?

01:43.603 --> 01:45.370
Are we open? Are we?

01:45.405 --> 01:47.272
- [mumbling]
- [Huda] Are we open? No?

01:47.307 --> 01:48.273
Yeah.

01:48.308 --> 01:50.476
She said no. [laughs]

01:50.510 --> 01:53.445
God! Okay. So...

01:53.480 --> 01:55.347
My mom is very opinionated.

01:55.381 --> 01:56.782
<i>Her and Wanda both.</i>

01:56.816 --> 01:59.284
<i>It's going to be interesting to
see if they are on the same page.</i>

01:59.319 --> 02:00.786
<i>If we are all on the same page</i>

02:00.820 --> 02:04.656
because they both have this look,
just this kinda way of like hmm-mmm, no.

02:04.691 --> 02:06.458
- I think that's gorgeous.
- Huda.

02:06.493 --> 02:09.461
- Oh, here's my bride.
- [excited] Hi!

02:10.497 --> 02:12.197
- I'm Kelsey, Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

02:12.232 --> 02:13.398
We're excited to be here.

02:13.433 --> 02:14.533
- Already seeing something?
- Yes.

02:14.567 --> 02:16.101
- Some eye candy?
- Yes, yes.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.470
We're already disagreeing
on some things. [chuckles]

02:18.505 --> 02:19.771
Yeah.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.406
Well, where is the wedding
going to be?

02:21.441 --> 02:23.542
- We are between venues.
- Okay.

02:23.576 --> 02:25.010
Either a castle

02:25.044 --> 02:27.457
or we are gonna go to a Caribbean
island and do a destination wedding.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.314
- Oh.
- So, the dress kinda dictates

02:29.349 --> 02:30.649
which venue we are gonna pick.

02:30.683 --> 02:32.784
Tell me a little bit about what
you are thinking for the dress.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.521
I would definitely
wanna try a ball gown.

02:35.555 --> 02:38.490
- Okay.
- I love a good sleeve with a little drama.

02:38.525 --> 02:40.792
I know, I want some sparkle,
some shimmer, you know,

02:40.827 --> 02:43.629
a little glamour. [chuckles]
You got to get that, right.

02:43.663 --> 02:46.465
Is there a price point
you want to be under?

02:46.499 --> 02:49.468
So, somewhere between
3,000 and 4,000.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.536
Okay. Cool.

02:50.570 --> 02:51.703
Mom wants a lot of drama.

02:51.738 --> 02:53.472
- So, we'll have to see what that means.
- Okay.

02:53.506 --> 02:54.840
I think she should go full glam.

02:54.874 --> 02:58.644
I think, I would like her
in something a little more...

02:58.678 --> 03:01.079
form fitted, mermaid type.

03:01.114 --> 03:03.549
I had a feeling you were
gonna be team fitted.

03:03.583 --> 03:05.384
And mom was gonna
be team ball gown.

03:05.418 --> 03:06.518
You see what I'm dealing with?

03:06.553 --> 03:09.421
I would love to just see her
in something beautiful.

03:09.455 --> 03:10.556
<i>Something grand.</i>

03:10.590 --> 03:12.391
I'm a super proud mom.

03:12.425 --> 03:14.693
She doesn't say much about
what she's done but,

03:14.727 --> 03:17.429
she's done some amazing things.

03:17.463 --> 03:19.298
And Huda what do you do?

03:19.332 --> 03:21.133
So, I'm a chef.

03:21.167 --> 03:21.934
She was on this show.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.569
Food network's
<i>Cutthroat Kitchen.</i>

03:23.603 --> 03:25.737
<i>Was a record setting winner.</i>

03:25.772 --> 03:27.873
She won more than anyone
in the history of the show.

03:27.907 --> 03:30.409
But I think one
of the great honors she had

03:30.443 --> 03:32.978
was cooking for the Obamas
at the White House.

03:33.246 --> 03:34.613
No way!

03:34.647 --> 03:37.783
[Huda]<i> It's an amazing honor.
I still don't believe it's real.</i>

03:37.817 --> 03:39.518
Feel very blessed to do
what I do.

03:39.552 --> 03:42.421
- Amazing!
- Yeah, I could brag all day about her.

03:42.455 --> 03:44.990
So today is super special
to do this with my mom.

03:45.024 --> 03:48.660
<i>I think this whole process for her
is going to be an interesting one.</i>

03:48.695 --> 03:52.097
We might even get tears today. I
don't know. I don't know. [chuckles]

03:52.665 --> 03:55.167
Oh, this one is good too.

03:57.270 --> 03:59.371
This one has a lot of tulle.

04:01.307 --> 04:03.141
I have some dresses!

04:03.176 --> 04:04.376
Yes, you do!

04:04.410 --> 04:05.644
[Kelsey] First dress here
is Maggie Sottero.

04:05.678 --> 04:08.547
This one has a sleeve
with a full tulle skirt.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.616
This one here is Martina Liana.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.652
Lots of glitter
and all that tulle.

04:13.686 --> 04:16.188
And then this one here
is Essense of Australia

04:16.222 --> 04:17.155
in a blush color.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.790
So pretty.

04:18.825 --> 04:21.193
And then a more mermaid fit
over here,

04:21.227 --> 04:22.561
is also Martina Liana.

04:22.595 --> 04:23.562
[Huda] That's so pretty.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.497
[Kelsey] So, what do you want
to try first?

04:25.531 --> 04:28.500
I think because my mom
doesn't want me to try color,

04:28.534 --> 04:29.801
I think we should try the blush.

04:29.836 --> 04:32.671
- Just to see, Just to see.
- Naturally. You wanna go against--

04:32.705 --> 04:35.374
Just to rebel a little bit.
[laughs]

04:35.408 --> 04:37.609
I just, I...
At this point I'm open.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.711
<i>So it's interesting
to find out, uh,</i>

04:39.746 --> 04:41.880
what I'm going to really like
and what's going to look good.

04:41.914 --> 04:46.385
So I'm excited and terrified
at the same time. [chuckles]

04:46.419 --> 04:47.352
[exhales]

04:48.354 --> 04:49.354
Oh.

04:50.723 --> 04:53.392
You will not cry
in the first dress. Um...

04:53.426 --> 04:55.427
I didn't expect

04:55.461 --> 04:57.429
<i>to get emotional over a dress.</i>

04:57.463 --> 04:58.697
<i>I was never the girl
who was like...</i>

04:58.731 --> 05:00.699
<i>"Oh, my God.
I'm getting married."</i>

05:00.733 --> 05:02.734
<i>It was like, okay great.
I found the love of my life.</i>

05:02.769 --> 05:04.736
<i>I feel very blessed
but it was like...</i>

05:05.838 --> 05:09.441
I didn't think I was gonna
cry over a dress. [laughs]

05:09.475 --> 05:11.476
This is, this is...

05:11.511 --> 05:14.012
Set the bar high at the start.
Good Lord.

05:19.952 --> 05:23.622
Julie, Your gonna work
with Daddy today? Yeah.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.991
Hey! Okay, good boy.

05:26.292 --> 05:27.959
Okay...

05:29.128 --> 05:29.995
Let's see

05:30.630 --> 05:32.964
what we have going on today.

05:33.299 --> 05:34.433
Hi, Randy.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.535
<i>Well, hello, beautiful.
How are you?</i>

05:36.569 --> 05:38.270
<i>Good. How are you?</i>

05:38.304 --> 05:39.571
Doing great. Doing great.

05:39.605 --> 05:42.341
Perfect. Well,
I have a beautiful bride.

05:42.375 --> 05:43.542
Her name is Huda.

05:43.576 --> 05:45.577
<i>I'd love for you to see her.
She's in the first dress.</i>

05:45.611 --> 05:47.379
<i>She's in an
Essense of Australia.</i>

05:47.413 --> 05:49.114
<i>Okay. I would love to meet her.</i>

05:49.148 --> 05:51.650
Huda, I'd like you to meet
someone I have with me.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.552
- Hi, Randy!
- Hello, beautiful.

05:53.586 --> 05:55.687
[both] How are you?

05:55.722 --> 05:57.789
So tell me about the wedding
and what you're looking for.

05:57.824 --> 06:01.426
Me and my fiance, we're either
going to do a castle wedding.

06:01.461 --> 06:03.662
- Oh!
<i>- Or we are gonna do a destination wedding.</i>

06:03.696 --> 06:05.997
We had to reschedule
our wedding because of COVID.

06:06.032 --> 06:10.001
So now, we just wanna have a
joyous occasion to celebrate our love.

06:10.036 --> 06:10.702
What's his name?

06:10.737 --> 06:13.538
- His name is Lamar.
- Lamar.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.340
I get all cheesy
when I say his name.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.409
I love him so much.
He's so amazing.

06:17.443 --> 06:18.610
We met twice.

06:18.644 --> 06:20.545
Um, and both times

06:20.580 --> 06:24.449
<i>were just random occurrences
in the universe.</i>

06:24.484 --> 06:27.252
But the second time,
he re-introduced himself

06:27.286 --> 06:29.121
and it just... It clicked.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.758
<i>And, he's just amazing.</i>

06:32.792 --> 06:34.459
<i>And he hasn't stopped
being that.</i>

06:34.494 --> 06:37.306
<i>We've been together for,
going on nine years now.</i>

06:37.330 --> 06:38.597
<i>And he's just... Everyday,</i>

06:38.631 --> 06:39.765
<i>I just look at him and I'm like,</i>

06:39.799 --> 06:42.367
<i>I love you more today
than I did yesterday.</i>

06:43.636 --> 06:46.338
And there goes...
What is happening?

06:46.372 --> 06:49.374
I don't cry in public. [laughs]

06:51.043 --> 06:54.846
Is this... Is this your first time
trying wedding dresses at all?

06:54.881 --> 06:55.714
This is it!

06:55.748 --> 06:57.382
Well, If you, If you are going
to do it.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.017
You might as well do it right
at Kleinfeld.

06:59.051 --> 07:01.353
-That's what I'm saying.
-[Kelsey] Okay, Randy. We're heading out.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.121
Okay.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.996
-The silence!
-The silence is good. [chuckles]

07:11.597 --> 07:13.298
- Speechless.
- Hi, guys.

07:19.172 --> 07:22.073
So, I have someone to add
to the appointment as well.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.008
Hi!

07:23.042 --> 07:24.643
Randy, I'm going to keep you
close with them.

07:24.677 --> 07:26.745
So you guys can
be our entourage.

07:26.779 --> 07:29.247
- Yes.
- [Randy]<i> Here we go, right there is perfect.</i>

07:29.282 --> 07:31.016
<i>There we go.</i>

07:31.317 --> 07:32.517
Hi, Mom.

07:32.552 --> 07:34.252
What'd you think?

07:36.656 --> 07:40.325
<i>You know, I'm just waiting
for my mom's face to light up,</i>

07:40.359 --> 07:41.726
<i>and it doesn't.</i>

07:41.761 --> 07:44.729
Everyone's staring at me
and everyone's quiet.

07:44.764 --> 07:48.233
<i>Wanda and my mother
are not quiet people.</i>

07:48.267 --> 07:49.434
<i>So, I'm nervous.</i>

07:52.371 --> 07:54.372
It's... beautiful.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.874
Go ahead. She about to
come for me.

07:55.908 --> 07:59.311
No, no, no, but
I'd love to see more.

07:59.345 --> 07:59.978
Ah!

08:00.012 --> 08:01.847
It's a beautiful dress but...

08:01.881 --> 08:05.250
- I just think... No.
- [Huda] Not the one?

08:05.284 --> 08:06.651
I'm... I'm not. No.

08:06.686 --> 08:09.354
I do love how dramatic this is.

08:09.388 --> 08:11.501
- Like, I do love that.
- I just...

08:11.525 --> 08:12.858
Randy, what do you think?

08:12.892 --> 08:17.629
Okay. Huda, you said that you
might be getting married in a castle.

08:17.663 --> 08:21.333
So, for me I see something
even grander.

08:21.367 --> 08:23.535
Go ahead, Randy. Okay. [laughs]

08:23.569 --> 08:25.470
Like, a fuller skirt
is what I was thinking.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.572
I'm willing to try.
I... I don't know.

08:27.607 --> 08:28.840
I don't know what I don't know.

08:28.875 --> 08:32.444
Kelsey, I had a couple
of dresses in mind.

08:32.478 --> 08:34.513
One of them is Anastasia.

08:34.547 --> 08:37.616
- Oh.
- Anastasia is really grand.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.518
Well. I kinda want
to try Anastasia.

08:39.552 --> 08:41.586
- I need to meet Anastasia.
- I'll show you both.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.355
- You can tell me which one you like.
- Thank you.

08:43.389 --> 08:44.556
Okay, let's do it.

08:44.590 --> 08:45.790
Okay, good luck.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.293
Pray for me. [chuckles]

08:55.568 --> 08:57.202
Oh, my goodness.

08:59.171 --> 09:01.806
Ah, It's so fancy.

09:01.841 --> 09:05.577
It's too fancy for us
Florida girls.

09:05.611 --> 09:07.579
We came up here all the way
from Florida.

09:07.613 --> 09:09.514
One, because New York
is so fabulous.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.283
Two, Florida has...

09:12.385 --> 09:13.985
...in regards to, uh,

09:14.020 --> 09:18.123
wedding dresses. Sorry,
Sunshine State but it's true.

09:18.157 --> 09:19.491
Hi, I'm Paula.

09:19.525 --> 09:21.359
Nice to meet you. And you are?

09:21.394 --> 09:22.527

- Hi, Wendy.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.762
How are you?
So nice to meet you.

09:23.796 --> 09:24.863
- I'm Paula, Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.865
- And who ae you?
- That's my hunka burning love.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.345
- I'm Dean.
- Oh, my Gosh! You bought your fiance with you?

09:29.369 --> 09:31.636
This is gonna be
a fun appointment.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.939
This is a second marriage
for both of us.

09:33.973 --> 09:37.375
So, we are not into
the whole traditional thing.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.710
And I value his opinion.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.579
He knows what looks best on me.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.347
- [chuckles]
- Tell me what you looking for?

09:42.381 --> 09:44.449
Okay. Well, I...

09:44.483 --> 09:46.518
Looking for... Definitely,
I would...

09:46.552 --> 09:48.219
My preference is something
that's black.

09:48.487 --> 09:49.988
Okay.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.392
But I'm open to champ...
Ah not champagne, what is it,

09:54.427 --> 09:55.727
- blush or white.
- Blush.

09:55.761 --> 09:58.730
- Okay.
- But, I just want something that's gonna compliment me.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.632
Something I'm not gonna feel
too like,

10:00.666 --> 10:02.701
oh, my boobs are
hanging out everywhere.

10:02.735 --> 10:03.935
Look, as long as it looks good,

10:03.970 --> 10:06.738
and it makes... You know,
looks good on my body,

10:06.772 --> 10:08.440
and it doesn't show
too much [bleep] I'm good.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.942
Tell me about your imagination.

10:10.977 --> 10:13.144
Do you have a good imagination?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.481
The reason why I asked that
is because,

10:16.515 --> 10:18.984
there are dresses in here
that might be an ivory,

10:19.018 --> 10:20.719
but I can order them in black.

10:20.753 --> 10:23.655
The wedding is gonna be black
and pink,

10:23.689 --> 10:28.159
and fabulous and lace
and gothic and just...

10:29.095 --> 10:30.795
Hmm.

10:31.330 --> 10:32.631
<i>So, I'm sort of going,</i>

10:32.665 --> 10:35.233
is she going to be able
to deliver?

10:36.636 --> 10:39.804
[exhales] It's going to be hard.

10:39.839 --> 10:41.539
So can you tell me
how the two of you met?

10:41.574 --> 10:43.942
We had that little bit
of somethin' somethin'.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.443
Yeah, there was little
something going on there.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.411
Fireworks, honey.

10:48.414 --> 10:52.651
We were both married, uh, then
she got... she had been divorced,

10:52.685 --> 10:54.386
I was going through one.

10:56.288 --> 10:58.590
And we went out one night,
and we were at this club

10:58.624 --> 11:00.959
- and we just kind of...
- Clicked.

11:00.993 --> 11:01.626
<i>- Clicked.
- Yeah.</i>

11:01.661 --> 11:02.627
[Valerie]<i> It was that thing.</i>

11:02.662 --> 11:05.430
<i>The next night
we went out, it was like...</i>

11:05.464 --> 11:07.732
<i>I told him, I said
"I think I love you."</i>

11:08.701 --> 11:11.503
[Dean]<i> We have what</i>
<i>people are looking for.</i>

11:11.537 --> 11:15.073
- Yeah.
- We've found what love is.

11:17.243 --> 11:18.977
So, how do you see Valerie?

11:19.512 --> 11:20.912
Well, I see Valerie...

11:20.946 --> 11:24.382
She was always wanting
to wear something of a dark...

11:25.117 --> 11:26.484
uh, dress.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.454
But I think also,
being at Kleinfeld's,

11:29.488 --> 11:32.724
she can be convinced
to wear anything.

11:32.758 --> 11:34.726
- Oh, really? Okay.
- Yes.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.895
So let's see
what we can do here.

11:36.929 --> 11:39.731
Okay, so why don't you guys
go have a seat over there.

11:39.765 --> 11:41.900
- You're gonna come back with me this way.
- Have fun.

11:41.934 --> 11:44.436
I am definitely looking for
something a little bit

11:44.503 --> 11:46.504
different, I mean,
obviously, I'm not a virgin.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.139
So, that's why.

11:48.174 --> 11:53.845
I don't really want that whole
traditional ballgown poufy and... [exhales]

11:53.879 --> 11:56.414
"My prince charming." That's
not... I'm not about that life.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.582
So I'm going to go out and shop.

11:57.616 --> 12:00.118
- See you in a few minutes.
- Okay. Have fun.

12:02.621 --> 12:06.324
Every so often, we do have
something of a different color.

12:06.358 --> 12:09.661
But today, unfortunately, I don't
have anything to show her in black.

12:10.262 --> 12:11.596
This is a beautiful dress.

12:11.630 --> 12:15.667
I just get this feeling that once
she puts on something that's white

12:15.701 --> 12:17.836
or ivory,
she may change her mind.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.805
Now, both of these dresses,
I cannot order in black.

12:20.840 --> 12:26.911
Could be a problem if Valerie is
really stuck on having a black dress.

12:26.946 --> 12:31.750
<i>So, we'll see what she has to
say when she sees these colors.</i>

12:31.784 --> 12:34.185
- Can I come in, Valerie?
- Of course.

12:34.220 --> 12:38.523
Okay, so I brought three different
dresses, three different silhouettes,

12:38.557 --> 12:40.959
and I want to chat
with you about them.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.296
Hang on a minute. Where's
the black? Where's the blush?

12:45.331 --> 12:47.866
Where's what I was looking for?

12:47.900 --> 12:51.936
Are we gonna be able to be
right here with what I want?

12:52.471 --> 12:55.373
So, this is...

12:55.407 --> 12:57.809
a Michelle Roth dress. Michelle
will make this in black for you.

12:57.843 --> 13:00.445
- [gasps] No, she won't.
- Yes, she will.

13:00.479 --> 13:02.847
- Okay.
- Then...

13:02.882 --> 13:04.616
- I have this dress.
- I'm not gonna lie, no.

13:04.650 --> 13:07.685
-I don't like the...
-Okay. Good to know. Good to know.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.155
Then, this is more of an A-line.

13:10.189 --> 13:11.322
And it's in blush.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.358
It is a lot though.

13:13.392 --> 13:15.660
- A lot in what way?
- I guess a lot of

13:15.961 --> 13:16.795
layers.

13:16.829 --> 13:18.563
So, I think out of
all three of these,

13:18.597 --> 13:20.465
- you're liking that one best.
- I would try that one. Yeah.

13:20.499 --> 13:22.000
- So let's put that on, okay?
- All right.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.836
You never know
unless you try it.

13:25.171 --> 13:26.571
[groaning]

13:26.605 --> 13:30.241
My biggest concern, and what
I've been, like, losing sleep over

13:30.276 --> 13:33.545
is getting my... ladies

13:33.579 --> 13:38.149
into a dress that, you know,
might be a little small.

13:38.617 --> 13:40.018
Let me tell you...

13:40.653 --> 13:43.288
Having big boobs, it is a...

13:44.290 --> 13:45.456
Hmm.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.125
The struggle is real.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.961
I am a little self-conscious
about my breasts.

13:49.995 --> 13:53.331
You know, I just don't want to look like
a hoochie mama walking down the aisle.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.437
I'm sorry, but this just
doesn't speak to me for you.

14:00.573 --> 14:01.873
Look at your hands.
You're covering up.

14:01.907 --> 14:03.752
When you come out,
you're supposed to be like,

14:03.776 --> 14:06.377
<i>look at me, and you
haven't done that.</i>

14:07.446 --> 14:09.647
- [Paula] Valerie.
- Yes, ma'am.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.317
- Just, everything you were asking me for, really.
- Yeah.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.985
Just not in black.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.788
I've been insistent since day one, I want
something black, I want something black,

14:16.822 --> 14:17.922
<i>I want something black.</i>

14:17.957 --> 14:20.992
I hope that I can find
something that I'm looking for.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.636
[Valerie]<i> Let me tell you,</i>
<i>having big boobs, it is a...</i>

14:31.670 --> 14:33.271
The struggle is real.

14:39.511 --> 14:41.279
- Ooh.
- [laughs]

14:42.481 --> 14:45.984
Okay, dress number one.
Step up, Valerie.

14:47.519 --> 14:49.854
I like the silhouette on you.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.258
I think that silhouette looks
really very flattering on you.

14:55.861 --> 15:00.632
We can get this dress in
blush, and we can get it in black.

15:00.666 --> 15:04.636
The lace would remain in the
eye. Very aligning it would be...

15:04.670 --> 15:06.437
- Oh.
- ...the other color.

15:06.472 --> 15:08.039
I bet that's lovely.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.841
So I'm sitting there and
I'm going, hang on a minute,

15:09.875 --> 15:14.279
are you guys not reading what I'm
trying to say, that I'm just not into this.

15:14.313 --> 15:16.247
I like it. I think it's pretty.

15:16.282 --> 15:18.416
- Darling?
- Looks good.

15:18.450 --> 15:19.684
"Looks good"?
That's all you have to say?

15:19.718 --> 15:21.286
You look good in it.

15:21.320 --> 15:25.189
This is not the dress that Dean is gonna
want to grab me and take me in the back.

15:25.224 --> 15:26.291
Like I said, it's good.

15:26.992 --> 15:28.126
But...

15:28.160 --> 15:29.594
- you're looking for fierce.
- There's something about it.

15:29.628 --> 15:31.663
- Let's see what else we can come up with.
- Good is not good enough.

15:31.697 --> 15:33.531
No, good is not good enough.

15:33.565 --> 15:36.234
I personally, just can't wait
to get out of this dress.

15:36.268 --> 15:39.671
<i>But there's no other dresses in
the change room for me to go into,</i>

15:39.705 --> 15:45.176
then, I'm just starting to go,
"Am I going to find anything here?"

15:46.779 --> 15:50.214
I really love it. And what
I really, really love is this.

15:51.717 --> 15:55.386
- I feel like they weren't as excited as you were.
- They were not!

15:55.421 --> 15:57.622
[Huda]<i> Love you, Mom.</i>
<i>Love you, Wanda.</i>

15:57.656 --> 16:01.726
But, they're opinionated, so getting us
all in the same page is going to be a lot.

16:01.760 --> 16:05.296
<i>And the dress determines
where we get married.</i>

16:05.331 --> 16:06.731
So I have to find a dress today.

16:06.765 --> 16:09.167
- Let's see that next.
- The Mermaid.

16:09.201 --> 16:10.969
- Let's see The Mermaid.
- I think this is a good plan because

16:11.003 --> 16:13.938
- Wanda definitely wanted to see you in something fitted.
- [laughs] She did.

16:13.973 --> 16:18.843
Now, it doesn't have sleeves, which,
I don't know how I feel about that.

16:18.877 --> 16:19.711
This is pretty.

16:19.745 --> 16:22.480
- This looks awesome.
- I like the waist.

16:22.514 --> 16:24.349
- I don't know.
- Totally different shape.

16:24.383 --> 16:26.150
-I want to show them -Okay.

16:27.753 --> 16:30.021
- Uh-oh, here she comes.
- Uh-oh, right here.

16:30.055 --> 16:32.223
Is she coming? I wanna see.
Turn me around, so I can see.

16:35.127 --> 16:36.327
[Wanda] Okay.

16:37.496 --> 16:38.629
Hello, everyone.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.132
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.537
Okay.

16:46.572 --> 16:48.206
Completely different.

16:49.541 --> 16:50.975
What do we think?

16:54.580 --> 16:56.014
Uh oh, here it comes.

16:58.817 --> 17:02.020
I come out in the dress,
and I'm like, okay, it's cute.

17:02.054 --> 17:03.921
We're a little cinched in,
we got a little waist,

17:03.956 --> 17:07.125
<i>it's like, okay, girls are like,
"Hello and how you doing?"</i>

17:07.159 --> 17:13.364
<i>And my mother, of course, and
Wanda both crickets, just, nothing.</i>

17:14.900 --> 17:16.601
I'm sorry but this just
doesn't speak to me

17:16.635 --> 17:17.802
<i>- for you.</i>
- [laughs]

17:17.836 --> 17:19.837
Look at your hands, you're
covering up, you're not--

17:19.872 --> 17:22.573
- And you're-- - I don't
know where to put my hands.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.409
- [both laughing]
- There are no pockets.

17:24.443 --> 17:25.810
When you come out,
you're supposed to be like,

17:25.844 --> 17:29.180
<i>"Look at me",
and you haven't done that.</i>

17:29.214 --> 17:30.782
- Okay.
- Okay, so.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.550
I agree with that. [laughs]

17:32.818 --> 17:33.818
Uh-oh.

17:33.852 --> 17:35.787
She has a dress.
What--What are you looking at?

17:35.821 --> 17:38.222
- What is she eyeing?
- She's looking at something.

17:38.257 --> 17:39.690
Oh my, she's going rogue.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.559
- Oh, Lord!
- I'll take it.

17:41.593 --> 17:43.394
I was surprised
it took this long.

17:43.429 --> 17:44.762
- Wanda?
- Yes?

17:44.797 --> 17:47.899
The first thing you need
to do is check the price.

17:47.933 --> 17:51.469
Okay, where do I see the
price? Okay, she has friends.

17:51.503 --> 17:53.871
[all laughing]

17:53.906 --> 17:54.950
How much is it?

17:54.974 --> 17:57.475
- I don't think she answered the question.
- $4,900.

17:57.509 --> 17:59.477
- [laughs]
- It's very pretty.

17:59.511 --> 18:01.179
That dress, oh!

18:01.780 --> 18:02.780
Maybe?

18:02.815 --> 18:05.450
I mean, I love the crystal
work that's happening.

18:05.484 --> 18:06.684
- Mom, you're on board with this?
- I don't...

18:06.718 --> 18:09.587
I don't know how
it's gonna look on you but,

18:09.621 --> 18:12.023
- I think it's a--
- I guess we should try it.

18:12.057 --> 18:13.591
[Wanda] All right,
remember, Huda,

18:13.625 --> 18:15.193
we want you to walk out...

18:15.227 --> 18:16.227
[Huda] I love you, too.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.163
All right, walk out
only in the dress, sweetie.

18:23.836 --> 18:26.604
- [Paula] Okay, Valerie, come on it.
- All right.

18:26.638 --> 18:28.072
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.508
So, we need to regroup.

18:30.542 --> 18:31.843
I think so.

18:31.877 --> 18:35.213
After seeing these first three
dresses that were brought in to me,

18:35.247 --> 18:37.315
I'm kinda like going ugh!

18:37.349 --> 18:38.583
I hope I'm not here all day.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.785
And I hope that I can find
something that I'm looking for.

18:40.819 --> 18:42.620
This is beautiful,
don't get me wrong.

18:42.654 --> 18:45.123
Um, but just all this tulle
underneath...

18:45.157 --> 18:46.757
- [Paula] It's just too much for you.
- It's too much.

18:46.792 --> 18:47.959
- [Paula] Okay.
- Yeah.

18:47.993 --> 18:50.361
- Strap-wise, do you think you want a strap?
- I love it...

18:50.395 --> 18:52.763
I like a spaghetti strap,

18:52.798 --> 18:54.776
- you know, 'cause I need something to hold me up.
- Okay.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.368
- I would love a black dress.
- Right.

18:57.402 --> 18:58.903
- But I am open to blush.
- Okay.

18:58.937 --> 19:01.639
It would have to be something
amazingly spectacular.

19:01.673 --> 19:03.574
- What we're gonna do is gonna take you out of that.
- Yeah.

19:03.609 --> 19:04.709
- We're gonna take these out.
- Yeah.

19:04.743 --> 19:06.711
- We'll just start all over again.
- All right.

19:06.745 --> 19:09.714
It's not that I don't think
she will be able to deliver,

19:09.748 --> 19:12.850
Miss Paula,
but it's more a matter of...

19:13.752 --> 19:15.820
is our communication
gonna come together

19:15.854 --> 19:19.657
and be able to bring something
fabulous to the table.

19:19.691 --> 19:22.960
This dress might be perfect.

19:25.697 --> 19:27.632
She likes a spaghetti strap.

19:27.666 --> 19:30.101
Only problem is
it doesn't come in black.

19:30.135 --> 19:34.005
But it is over, like,
a really pretty nude shade.

19:34.039 --> 19:36.240
And she did say
she was open to that.

19:36.275 --> 19:38.476
So I'm bringing her this one.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.710
- [knock on door]
- [Valerie] Yes?

19:39.745 --> 19:42.480
- [Paula] Valerie?
- Yes, ma'am.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.715
- Just everything you were asking me for, really.
- Yeah.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.551
- [Paula] Just not in black.
- Yeah, I know.

19:46.585 --> 19:47.652
[Paula] But it's
in a champagne color.

19:47.686 --> 19:48.920
- It's beautiful.
- I know, I know.

19:48.954 --> 19:52.456
- I'm warming... Warming up.
- [Paula] Look at the back on this.

19:52.491 --> 19:54.325
- [Valerie] All right, why not?
- Okay. Let's do it.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.826
What could possibly go wrong?

19:56.662 --> 19:59.197
I have been insistent
since day one,

19:59.231 --> 20:01.566
I want something black, I want
something black, I want something black.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.235
But, okay, let's see what we...

20:04.269 --> 20:05.336
let's see what you got here.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.270
Okay.

20:07.573 --> 20:09.540
Oh, my [bleep]
look great in this.

20:09.575 --> 20:11.108
- Everything looks great in this.
- Look at that!

20:11.143 --> 20:13.477
- You look stunning.
- Now if my boobs sat like that

20:13.512 --> 20:15.479
- on a regular basis...
- This is what you do.

20:15.514 --> 20:17.348
...I would be like,

20:17.382 --> 20:19.050
I would just walk around
like this all day

20:19.084 --> 20:20.718
- and be like...
- Wait. Let me just...

20:20.752 --> 20:23.854
Honey, the dark clouds
have lifted.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.891
There's rainbows and
sugar plums and butterflies,

20:26.925 --> 20:28.926
and I think,
"This is freakin' it, yes."

20:28.961 --> 20:31.062
- Juggle, but can we put--
- You know what we can also do?

20:31.096 --> 20:33.497
We can add some...
We can order some lace,

20:33.532 --> 20:34.699
and we can fill in
just a little bit.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.467
Yeah, 'cause I don't
want it to be like...

20:36.501 --> 20:37.535
[vocalizing]

20:37.569 --> 20:38.569
- No.
- I don't want that.

20:38.604 --> 20:40.571
I'm really, really, really
hoping that, Dean,

20:40.606 --> 20:42.440
<i>I get the reaction from Dean.</i>

20:42.474 --> 20:43.975
I don't want to get down there

20:44.009 --> 20:47.278
and first thing he says to
me is, "You're wearing that?"

20:50.816 --> 20:54.485
[Kelsey] So, we are
in the Anastasia.

20:54.519 --> 20:56.754
It's so pretty!

20:56.788 --> 21:00.524
Being in this dress, do you
still wanna try the Pantora dress

21:00.559 --> 21:02.093
that Wanda had pulled?

21:02.527 --> 21:03.861
Uh, I think so.

21:03.895 --> 21:04.862
You just want another dress?

21:04.896 --> 21:07.031
If I have to fight for it,
I'll fight for it.

21:08.433 --> 21:09.834
And this right here I think,

21:09.868 --> 21:12.169
it's not hitting me
in the proper place.

21:13.305 --> 21:14.405
<i>What's gonna happen here?</i>

21:14.439 --> 21:16.240
Are we gonna have
to postpone it again?

21:17.643 --> 21:20.044
[sobs] Oh, my God.

21:33.859 --> 21:36.627
Okay, Huda. So, I have
the Anastasia dress.

21:36.662 --> 21:39.697
- [Huda] Hello, Anastasia.
- [Kelsey] That Randy had recommended.

21:39.731 --> 21:42.099
- It's like it's a series skirt. Oh, my God.
- I know, right.

21:42.134 --> 21:46.237
And it does have even
more detail on the train too.

21:46.271 --> 21:48.472
- This is a lot of dress that I am here for.
- Yeah, right?

21:48.507 --> 21:51.809
It's gorgeous.
Sleeveless but gorgeous.

21:51.843 --> 21:55.946
So, I was excited to try that on but still
a little nervous about it being sleeveless,

21:55.981 --> 21:59.684
wasn't sure that was the move
but he recommended it

21:59.718 --> 22:01.596
and I know he knows
what he's doing.

22:01.620 --> 22:04.655
So, I think this Anastasia
dress will be perfect for Huda.

22:04.690 --> 22:09.860
I actually have it in pink as
my finale and as you can see

22:09.895 --> 22:11.996
it hits right at the top
of the shoulders

22:12.030 --> 22:16.467
and it cinches in at the waist and
then has a really full grand skirt.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.336
So, I think it's gonna
show off her curves nicely.

22:19.371 --> 22:21.472
Okay, let's see if she likes it.

22:21.506 --> 22:24.542
- How do you feel?
- This is...

22:24.576 --> 22:28.179
Yeah, I wanna show them.
Like I'm just excited to show them.

22:28.213 --> 22:29.480
Here it comes.

22:29.514 --> 22:33.951
[Wanda] Wow, Oh. Oh!

22:43.662 --> 22:46.430
So, Randy, you might
recognize this dress.

22:46.465 --> 22:48.399
Oh, my goodness!

22:48.433 --> 22:51.168
[Wanda] Oh, my gosh.
You look stunning.

22:51.603 --> 22:53.304
Are you crying?

22:55.207 --> 22:57.007
It's so pretty.

22:59.811 --> 23:02.913
Ah! Why am I crying?
No crying on the dress.

23:02.948 --> 23:07.351
That's okay, you can cry on it. I'm
gonna get you a new one if you love it.

23:08.620 --> 23:10.921
It's everything I didn't know
I wanted in a dress.

23:10.956 --> 23:16.794
[Huda]<i> It has romantic lace
and it's just like drama and...</i>

23:16.828 --> 23:22.466
<i>regal and beauty and just, ah!
That train is everything.</i>

23:22.501 --> 23:27.271
<i>I feel so beautiful
and I just, ah, I can't.</i>

23:27.305 --> 23:28.372
Mom, what do you think?

23:31.476 --> 23:33.611
I'm... I'm speechless.

23:33.645 --> 23:36.580
- Aww!
- That's beautiful.

23:36.615 --> 23:38.449
Do you love it
or you just like it?

23:38.483 --> 23:40.718
- I love it.
- Wanda?

23:40.752 --> 23:45.423
I love it. I do. I love it.
It is beautiful.

23:45.457 --> 23:49.293
Look at that. I said
we have to go big or go home.

23:49.327 --> 23:51.462
I feel like I can dance.

23:51.496 --> 23:52.463
- Oh, yeah!
- [all cheering]

23:53.732 --> 23:57.601
I'm just so excited that everyone
loves it just as much as I do.

23:57.636 --> 23:59.770
'Cause it's just such
a beautiful moment.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.872
So, now here's
the tough question.

24:01.907 --> 24:05.443
Being in this dress, do you
still wanna try the Pantora dress

24:05.477 --> 24:07.411
that Wanda had pulled?

24:08.246 --> 24:09.613
I think so.

24:09.648 --> 24:12.450
-Wait a minute, Mom. You're flip flopping.
-I know.

24:12.484 --> 24:14.351
- What do you mean, mom?
- [Kelsey] Mom's like, wait.

24:14.386 --> 24:15.386
Do we need to try one more?

24:15.420 --> 24:17.054
[Huda] You just want
another dress?

24:17.088 --> 24:18.389
I don't know.

24:18.423 --> 24:21.158
Randy, you see this? I done
cried that she wants another dress.

24:21.193 --> 24:22.560
[all laughing]

24:22.594 --> 24:25.062
You brought her.
I don't know what to tell ya.

24:25.630 --> 24:28.232
I had to. She's my momma.

24:30.068 --> 24:33.404
Mom, because I love you,
I will try the other dress on

24:33.438 --> 24:35.206
but we gonna end up back here.

24:35.240 --> 24:36.774
I just want you to know.

24:36.808 --> 24:40.544
Listen, I love my mother
but I picked my dress.

24:40.579 --> 24:43.314
So, if I have to fight for it,
I'll fight for it.

24:43.348 --> 24:46.517
Darling, don't.

24:46.551 --> 24:48.285
Really, Mom? Really?

24:53.458 --> 24:55.793
That's gorgeous.
You look stunning.

24:55.827 --> 24:59.630
I'm really, really, really hoping that
Dean, I get the reaction from Dean.

24:59.664 --> 25:03.033
I don't want to get down there
and first thing he says to me is,

25:03.568 --> 25:05.102
"You're wearing that?"

25:06.471 --> 25:10.040
Oh, oh, ooh!

25:14.613 --> 25:16.580
- [Wendy] Yes, please.
- How stunning.

25:16.615 --> 25:19.149
More of that, please.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.485
-Look at, Valarie.
-That's awesome. I love the cleavage.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.389
- She's stunning.
- I would just say, yummy.

25:26.791 --> 25:27.925
- Looking good, sassy.
- I love it.

25:27.959 --> 25:30.027
[Valerie] There's nothing
about that dress I don't love.

25:30.061 --> 25:35.933
I feel sexy, I feel beautiful. I
feel like my body looks good in it.

25:35.967 --> 25:40.204
- And I love this dress.
- I think I might be okay with not wearing black.

25:40.238 --> 25:43.841
Well, you could always add to your, like,
black nails, maybe some black diamonds.

25:43.875 --> 25:46.510
I have a question.
Aren't you gonna wear a veil?

25:46.545 --> 25:48.379
- No.
- Again.

25:48.413 --> 25:50.614
- See, what one looks like.
- Ugh, really?

25:50.649 --> 25:53.717
Let's do a veil and let's
do a sparkly head piece.

25:53.752 --> 25:57.721
I'm not a veil girl. I've never really
been a veil girl but you know what,

25:57.756 --> 26:01.692
Paula, she was right on this
dress. She's saying you know,

26:01.726 --> 26:04.461
"Do you wanna try out a veil?"
I'm gonna listen to her.

26:04.496 --> 26:06.497
I think it just looks so pretty.

26:06.531 --> 26:09.433
- [Dean] Hmm.
- [Wendy] Oh, snap.

26:11.169 --> 26:12.303
Go away!

26:13.305 --> 26:14.772
This is amazing.

26:14.806 --> 26:19.109
- Ugh! Alright let's do the big unveil now.
- Let's.

26:21.012 --> 26:25.449
[Paula] Okay, Valarie. Open those
beautiful eyes and look at yourself.

26:25.483 --> 26:28.218
Oh! Well, tickle me
pink and call me Rhonda.

26:29.654 --> 26:34.725
I turn around and I'm
just like, "Holy beep."

26:34.759 --> 26:39.763
I look amazing, like, I just felt like
a bride and I'm feeling all beautiful

26:39.798 --> 26:43.133
and fabulous and gorgeous and
fierce and exactly what I wanted to feel.

26:43.168 --> 26:48.839
In a black dress I wanted but I'm
now feeling it in an amazing white dress.

26:48.873 --> 26:51.208
And so, the big question is,

26:52.444 --> 26:55.045
are you saying yes to the dress?

26:56.982 --> 26:59.416
I'm saying hell mother,
yes to this dress.

27:00.318 --> 27:01.585
Congratulations.

27:01.620 --> 27:04.421
[Paula] Oh, Valarie. Goodluck.

27:10.128 --> 27:13.731
[Dean]<i> Valarie was looking for
three things, something sassy,</i>

27:13.765 --> 27:16.634
<i>something sexy
and something fierce.</i>

27:16.668 --> 27:19.436
<i>I think the second dress
nailed all three of those.</i>

27:19.471 --> 27:21.005
- [Wendy]<i> The trifecta.</i>
- [Dean]<i> Yes.</i>

27:21.072 --> 27:25.943
Well, alright. Think that, you know, we're
having a wedding and you know what?

27:26.444 --> 27:29.013
You're all invited.

27:34.519 --> 27:36.487
- Hello, hello.
- Hey, AJ!

27:36.521 --> 27:38.489
- How are you guys?
- Good, how are you?

27:38.523 --> 27:40.891
So, I got my dress about
a year and a half ago.

27:40.925 --> 27:43.560
- [woman] Are you saying yes to the dress?
- Yes!

27:43.595 --> 27:44.795
[all cheering]

27:44.829 --> 27:49.744
And I've had one fitting but
the dress didn't fit me well.

27:49.768 --> 27:52.469
So, it was a stressful fitting
for me for my first one.

27:52.504 --> 27:55.506
So, I really hope that
the second one turns out okay.

27:55.540 --> 27:57.441
If you guys wanna have a seat.
I will take her and get her

27:57.475 --> 27:58.742
dressed and we will
be out very shortly.

27:58.777 --> 28:01.145
- Can't wait.
- You come with me, my dear.

28:05.383 --> 28:06.316
Oh, boy!

28:07.886 --> 28:13.157
I'm... I'm just hoping that it's
everything that Natalia wants.

28:13.191 --> 28:14.992
<i>She's very particular.</i>

28:16.161 --> 28:17.327
How's it look?

28:19.164 --> 28:20.631
Look's good.

28:20.665 --> 28:23.500
It's beautiful,
little nervous about...

28:23.535 --> 28:24.535
- The bodice.
- The bodice there.

28:24.569 --> 28:25.769
The last time we dropped it,

28:25.804 --> 28:28.439
I want to say it was like an
inch and a half or two inches.

28:28.473 --> 28:31.375
So, I'm... I have a feeling
it's gonna be good today.

28:31.409 --> 28:33.477
- Let's try it on.
- We will see.

28:33.511 --> 28:38.615
This is her second fitting
for her big ball gown and...

28:38.650 --> 28:42.920
we have a little surprise today.
Natalia wanted a second dress.

28:42.987 --> 28:48.459
<i>She tried it on, she loved it
but her budget didn't allow it.</i>

28:48.493 --> 28:52.129
<i>So, this was more than
a year and a half ago.</i>

28:52.163 --> 28:56.266
She was very disappointed but
I said there's nothing we can do.

28:56.301 --> 28:58.869
<i>Your first gown is gorgeous,
you'll wear it the whole night.</i>

28:58.903 --> 29:02.473
Fortunately I was able to
work it out. They got the dress.

29:02.507 --> 29:06.577
And today, after she's fitted
with her first dress,

29:06.611 --> 29:10.414
AJ is gonna walk in and say,
"We have one more dress."

29:11.349 --> 29:13.117
She has no idea.

29:14.686 --> 29:18.255
- How many days away is it, Lex?
- It's only like four weeks.

29:18.289 --> 29:19.723
Four weeks from Saturday.

29:19.758 --> 29:23.961
My heart is in my throat.
I have to be honest with you.

29:25.230 --> 29:29.166
We were supposed to have it back
in September and then COVID hit

29:29.200 --> 29:32.936
and I knew that I wasn't gonna
be able to have this wedding.

29:32.971 --> 29:35.639
My dream was just pulled
out from under me.

29:35.673 --> 29:40.177
But now we're hoping and fingers
crossed that everything's gonna work out.

29:44.449 --> 29:45.983
I'm feeling good.

29:47.585 --> 29:50.354
I do feel like it still needs
to be dropped.

29:52.490 --> 29:56.894
- So, this is the Pantora dress.
- [Wanda] Oh, okay.

29:56.928 --> 30:00.030
- Very glamorous.
- That means you still on my team.

30:08.373 --> 30:10.340
I'm gonna try it out for Mom.

30:10.375 --> 30:12.075
- Yeah.
- But...

30:14.679 --> 30:16.413
We're gonna try it on for Mom.

30:16.447 --> 30:18.682
[Kelsey] Good plan. Good plan.

30:18.716 --> 30:21.952
We know this isn't the dress. So, Huda doesn't
even need to come out on the room in it.

30:21.986 --> 30:25.422
I'm going to bring her family closer
to the room so they can see the dress

30:25.456 --> 30:27.391
and then we can put back
on the favorite.

30:28.459 --> 30:29.993
Oh, perfect.

30:30.028 --> 30:33.597
All right, so this
is the Pantora dress.

30:33.631 --> 30:35.476
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, my!

30:35.500 --> 30:37.534
[Wanda] It's very glamorous.

30:37.569 --> 30:40.771
- It's very nice dress.
- That means you still on my team.

30:41.606 --> 30:44.374
- I like the other one.
- [Huda gasps]

30:45.076 --> 30:46.109
Yes!

30:47.378 --> 30:49.112
I wanna put my dress back on!

30:50.648 --> 30:52.516
I'm with you. I'm with you.

30:52.550 --> 30:55.519
- It just wasn't for her.
- Exactly.

30:55.553 --> 30:59.089
I'm glad that I picked
the dress but I was wrong.

31:00.458 --> 31:02.259
I was wrong about the dress.

31:03.261 --> 31:04.394
Here it comes.

31:08.733 --> 31:12.402
Oh, yeah. Oh, my goodness.
Look at that smile.

31:12.437 --> 31:15.539
[Wanda] Exactly, exactly,
exactly.

31:15.573 --> 31:19.710
- Yes. That's it.
- This is it.

31:19.744 --> 31:24.314
- This is...
- It is just absolutely gorgeous.

31:26.484 --> 31:29.820
She's just alive. I just...
I just love the way...

31:29.854 --> 31:33.857
I just love how you feel in it
because the dress is gorgeous

31:33.892 --> 31:39.229
without a doubt. You just
brought the dress alive. Look at it.

31:39.264 --> 31:40.564
[Priscilla] Yeah.

31:40.598 --> 31:43.667
You know, sometimes
you get it but you don't get it.

31:43.701 --> 31:46.503
[Priscilla]<i> Now I get it.</i>
<i>I get it. Now I get it.</i>

31:46.537 --> 31:48.372
- [Wanda]<i> That's exactly right.</i>
- [Priscilla]<i> I get it.</i>

31:48.406 --> 31:49.439
Wow!

31:50.608 --> 31:55.012
- Oh, mama. Look at your baby.
- You look so beautiful.

31:56.314 --> 31:57.247
[Huda whimpers]

32:00.451 --> 32:01.518
[exhales]

32:01.552 --> 32:03.220
Honey, she's looks like royalty.

32:07.125 --> 32:08.292
Wow!

32:09.427 --> 32:11.962
- You see her?
- Mm-hmm.

32:15.533 --> 32:17.067
It's so pretty.

32:17.101 --> 32:19.569
You look absolutely stunning
and I'm happy for you.

32:19.604 --> 32:22.472
- [Priscilla] Yeah.
- Don't cry, Lord.

32:22.507 --> 32:23.540
- Tears--
- [all laughing]

32:23.574 --> 32:25.642
- Oh, my Lord!
- [Huda] Where's the tissues?

32:25.677 --> 32:28.245
- Oh, God where's the tissue?
- Oh, my God!

32:28.279 --> 32:29.379
[all laughing]

32:29.414 --> 32:30.614
Who knew
was gonna cry over a dress?

32:30.648 --> 32:32.382
Randy, this is your fault.

32:32.417 --> 32:35.919
[laughing] Yay!
I love it to be my fault.

32:35.954 --> 32:39.523
Should we ask the question,
Huda? What do you think?

32:39.557 --> 32:41.792
I think you should ask the
question before I cry again.

32:41.826 --> 32:43.493
- [Huda chuckles]
- [Randy]<i> Okay, sweetie.</i>

32:43.528 --> 32:44.928
- Huda...
- [Randy]<i> Huda...</i>

32:44.963 --> 32:47.664
[both] Are you saying
"yes" to the dress?

32:47.699 --> 32:52.302
- I'm saying "yes" to the dress!
- [all whooping]

32:52.337 --> 32:55.339
[all laughing]

32:55.373 --> 32:56.540
Yes!

32:56.574 --> 32:59.710
[Huda]<i> I am excited. I am happy.</i>

32:59.744 --> 33:03.513
I... All these feelings, like,
I cried about a dress.

33:03.548 --> 33:06.249
<i>I didn't think that was
gonna happen. And I'm just...</i>

33:06.284 --> 33:08.385
I'm so excited to marry Lamar.

33:08.419 --> 33:10.187
I'm getting married!

33:10.221 --> 33:12.689
[all laughing]

33:12.724 --> 33:16.493
We were between a
destination wedding or a castle.

33:16.527 --> 33:19.463
<i>But I feel like
that dress is so grand!</i>

33:19.497 --> 33:21.665
<i>I think I'm Team Castle now.
Like I...</i>

33:21.699 --> 33:23.433
I feel like I have to do it.

33:23.468 --> 33:24.701
- Thank you, Randy!
- Bye, yo!

33:24.736 --> 33:27.204
You're a beautiful bride.
Remember that.

33:27.238 --> 33:28.205
[Huda] Thank you.

33:31.909 --> 33:34.611
- Yeah.
- It's not too much, but a little bit of sparkle.

33:34.645 --> 33:35.645
Just a little bit.

33:36.614 --> 33:39.483
I do feel like
it still needs to be dropped.

33:40.551 --> 33:42.986
I have a vision of what
I want it to look like.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.789
<i>So, this is super upsetting,
disappointing.</i>

33:45.823 --> 33:48.625
- I just want to make sure that that goes in.
- Yeah.

33:48.659 --> 33:52.262
What's gonna happen here? Are
we gonna have to postpone it again?

33:55.800 --> 33:58.402
-[Lexie] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-[Mary] Do you love it?

33:58.436 --> 34:00.537
- Oh, absolutely gorgeous.
- You look beautiful.

34:00.571 --> 34:02.139
[Mary] It's stunning.

34:03.207 --> 34:04.641
What do you... How do
you feel about the bodice?

34:04.675 --> 34:05.809
Yeah.

34:05.843 --> 34:08.578
[Lexie] I think it looks
beautiful. But is it how you--

34:08.613 --> 34:10.914
- Yeah, we're... Right here.
- What do you think?

34:10.948 --> 34:13.283
[Natalia] Just gotta make sure
this is...

34:13.317 --> 34:14.618
this is exactly what I want.

34:14.652 --> 34:17.821
I'm most concerned about it
not hitting me in the right place.

34:17.855 --> 34:21.291
I want to make sure
it accentuates my waist.

34:21.325 --> 34:22.526
<i>And right now it...</i>

34:22.560 --> 34:24.428
It's not hitting me
in the proper place.

34:24.462 --> 34:27.664
There's much more fabric
in the skirt, like,

34:27.698 --> 34:28.732
in the back
than there is in the front.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.467
'Cause this I think,
is hitting you at your waist.

34:30.501 --> 34:32.502
I think it's just in this curve.

34:32.537 --> 34:35.305
- So I think that by taking that in.
- [Natalia] Yeah. I like this.

34:35.373 --> 34:36.373
- [AJ] It's gonna pull...
- Yes.

34:36.407 --> 34:37.407
- That's much better.
- ...all of that

34:37.442 --> 34:38.975
- much tighter at her waist.
- [Mary] Much better.

34:39.010 --> 34:41.845
-[Mary] Yes, exactly, Natalia. That's exactly...
-[Natalia] That's what I want.

34:41.879 --> 34:43.947
Yeah, it makes a difference
when you pull it back like that.

34:43.981 --> 34:45.048
- [Mary] Oof!
- [Natalia] Yes.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.783
[Natalia] That's what I want.
Big difference there.

34:46.818 --> 34:49.486
AJ totally understood
what I was saying.

34:49.520 --> 34:51.421
<i>He listened to me.
He put everything.</i>

34:51.456 --> 34:53.723
<i>All the pins
in the right spots to make it</i>

34:53.758 --> 34:57.761
<i>so it's giving me that silhouette
shape. So, no. I'm feeling good now.</i>

34:57.795 --> 34:59.696
You chose the right
style dress, Natalia.

34:59.730 --> 35:02.432
Oh, yeah,
it's for my body, for sure.

35:02.467 --> 35:04.801
I have to say though,
I was between

35:04.836 --> 35:07.838
<i>either an A-line
or do I go simple,</i>

35:07.872 --> 35:11.741
super-sleek, tight to my body,
so I tried one of those on as well.

35:11.776 --> 35:14.845
<i>I wanted to change
into that sleek dress</i>

35:14.879 --> 35:18.048
<i>for, like, my party dress at the end
of the night, but, we couldn't get it.</i>

35:18.082 --> 35:20.951
<i>That's okay. I'll be in my
dress. I'll party in it all night.</i>

35:20.985 --> 35:22.752
It's beautiful. It'll last.

35:22.787 --> 35:25.055
- It's perfect.
- All the way down.

35:25.089 --> 35:27.491
This, I feel
so much better about.

35:27.525 --> 35:30.827
My ceremony is at West Point.

35:30.862 --> 35:33.463
<i>My fiance and I actually went
to high school together.</i>

35:33.498 --> 35:35.365
<i>But we didn't date
in high school.</i>

35:35.399 --> 35:37.601
He called me
our senior year of college,

35:37.635 --> 35:39.603
and asked me to go
to a West Point ball.

35:39.637 --> 35:42.939
<i>I said, "absolutely."
The rest is history.</i>

35:46.277 --> 35:49.846
<i>Brian proposed to me at this
beautiful resort in Colorado.</i>

35:49.881 --> 35:51.581
<i>It was phenomenal, so surprised,</i>

35:51.616 --> 35:54.351
which is very hard to surprise
me because I know everything.

35:54.886 --> 35:55.819
<i>We're a great team.</i>

35:55.853 --> 35:59.022
And I can't wait for him
to see me in this dress.

36:01.759 --> 36:03.360
- [Mary sighs] - [AJ] And
I'm gonna get out of your way.

36:05.663 --> 36:06.897
[Mary] Oh, Natalia.

36:06.931 --> 36:09.699
[Natalia] So beautiful.
Look how perfect that is.

36:09.734 --> 36:12.802
[Mary]<i> The second dress.</i>
<i>I want this to be a surprise.</i>

36:12.837 --> 36:16.239
Because of everything she
and Brian have been through.

36:16.274 --> 36:18.608
<i>COVID squelched everything.</i>

36:18.643 --> 36:20.977
I wanted to give her
something so special.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.647
[Natalia] I feel like this is good
with the fitting, what he did here.

36:23.681 --> 36:27.217
Yes, and you can definitely
see a little bit more of the sheer.

36:27.251 --> 36:28.185
[Lexie] Yeah.

36:30.388 --> 36:31.321
[Lexie] Natalia?

36:32.390 --> 36:33.390
Natalia?

36:35.092 --> 36:37.360
- [Natalia] No way.
- [Lexie] That's your dress.

36:37.395 --> 36:38.328
[Mary] It's for you.

36:39.263 --> 36:40.363
[sobbing]

36:40.398 --> 36:42.532
[Mary speaking]

36:42.567 --> 36:44.534
[crying]

36:44.569 --> 36:46.336
Oh, my God.

36:50.675 --> 36:53.476
Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

36:53.511 --> 36:57.480
Wow! I was not expecting that.
Oh, my gosh.

36:57.515 --> 37:00.183
- So you have another fitting.
- [all laughing]

37:01.185 --> 37:02.385
Oh, my gosh.

37:02.987 --> 37:03.920
Wow.

37:03.955 --> 37:06.423
I don't know how my mom
pulled this one off.

37:06.457 --> 37:08.458
She kept it from me. She's good.

37:08.492 --> 37:10.393
All right, follow me.

37:10.428 --> 37:12.529
I am nervous
getting into this dress.

37:12.563 --> 37:14.965
I... I hope
that everything looks good.

37:14.999 --> 37:18.668
<i>Because it's been so long
and I kind of gave up on it.</i>

37:18.703 --> 37:21.371
I don't know if it's gonna fit
me right. How's it gonna look?

37:21.405 --> 37:23.306
It's a totally different vibe.

37:33.651 --> 37:36.286
I don't know if it's gonna fit
me right. How's it gonna look?

37:36.320 --> 37:38.221
It's a totally different vibe.

37:40.725 --> 37:44.060
Oh, my gosh. It's even
better than I imagined it.

37:44.095 --> 37:48.098
I... From what I remember,
it's just...

37:48.132 --> 37:50.567
the best. And I was nervous
about how I was gonna look in it.

37:50.601 --> 37:52.602
But it really is so beautiful.

37:52.637 --> 37:54.371
[Mary] Can we look? We can look?

37:56.641 --> 37:58.875
[Lexie] Oh, my God! [chuckles]

37:59.477 --> 38:02.178
- Sexy too, huh?
- Whoo!

38:02.213 --> 38:03.346
- Hot mama!
- Oh my.

38:03.381 --> 38:04.648
- God!
- I know!

38:04.682 --> 38:05.749
[Mary] Oh, Talie...

38:05.783 --> 38:07.684
[AJ] Completely different vibe.

38:07.718 --> 38:09.586
- Totally different look, right?
- [Lexie] Oh, my God.

38:09.620 --> 38:12.989
- This is like, simple, sleek,
sexy. I don't-- - [Lexie] No.

38:13.024 --> 38:16.426
- [Lexie] Natalia. Oh, my God.
- [AJA] And in the back.

38:16.460 --> 38:17.460
Natalia.

38:17.495 --> 38:19.029
[Lexie] Are you kidding?

38:19.063 --> 38:19.729
[gasps] I know.

38:19.764 --> 38:21.398
- [Natalia] Damn, girl.
- Wow.

38:22.533 --> 38:26.503
As a mother, you just want
your child to be happy.

38:26.537 --> 38:30.507
<i>And I knew her heart
was as full as my heart</i>

38:30.541 --> 38:31.941
<i>when she saw that second dress.</i>

38:31.976 --> 38:34.477
- [Mary] Can you get down?
- [Lexie] Dancing's important.

38:34.512 --> 38:36.212
[AJ] Dancing is important.
Boogie.

38:36.247 --> 38:37.580
[Lexie and Mary laughing]

38:37.615 --> 38:39.749
- I can always dance.
- [all laughing]

38:39.784 --> 38:42.619
- She's a stunning bride and she's a good girl.
- Thanks, Mom.

38:42.653 --> 38:44.421
She's a great daughter.

38:44.455 --> 38:46.089
She's the best Mom.

38:46.123 --> 38:47.123
Absolutely.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.325
What a day!

38:48.359 --> 38:49.426
[whooping]

38:58.202 --> 39:01.271
It's my wedding day. And I'm
here with all of my bridesmaids.

39:01.305 --> 39:02.839
[all cheering]

39:02.873 --> 39:07.344
I'm feeling very excited, anxious.
But, in my stomach I'm feeling peace

39:07.378 --> 39:08.511
and ready to get married.

39:08.546 --> 39:09.946
Yes!

39:10.381 --> 39:11.548
Beautiful.

39:11.582 --> 39:14.451
I'm very excited, very ready
to put on my wedding dress.

39:14.485 --> 39:16.820
We made a lot of adjustments
and alterations.

39:16.854 --> 39:19.122
Um, and I think it's gonna be
perfect right around my waist.

39:19.156 --> 39:22.559
We dropped a lot of it down and I
think when I put it on with the veil,

39:22.593 --> 39:23.927
everything's gonna look
beautiful.

39:23.961 --> 39:27.130
[Lexie] Beautiful. Look at that
smile. She's so happy. [chuckles]

39:27.164 --> 39:31.601
[Natalia]<i> I am very, very excited
about the surprise later. Nobody knows.</i>

39:31.635 --> 39:33.503
<i>Except for my Maid of Honor
and that's it.</i>

39:33.537 --> 39:36.406
And none of my bridesmaids
know about my surprise.

39:36.440 --> 39:39.509
I am changing
into a reception dress

39:39.543 --> 39:41.745
<i>that I think Brian
is absolutely going to love.</i>

39:41.779 --> 39:44.147
<i>And I can't wait
for his reaction.</i>

39:45.616 --> 39:48.385
- [woman] Don't turn around yet. Not yet.
- Okay, ready girls?

39:51.522 --> 39:52.956
[all exclaim]

39:52.990 --> 39:55.625
Couldn't be a luckier man to
have someone like her in my life.

39:55.659 --> 39:57.527
<i>I would say that I'm most
nervous about the second</i>

39:57.561 --> 39:59.195
<i>that she's gonna walk
down the aisle.</i>

39:59.230 --> 40:01.331
<i>That's kind of the moment
we've been waiting for, right?</i>

40:01.365 --> 40:03.400
[upbeat wedding music playing]

40:26.390 --> 40:28.425
[priest] Dearly beloved.

40:28.459 --> 40:32.228
We've come together
in the presence of God,

40:32.263 --> 40:36.399
to witness the joining of this man
and this woman in holy matrimony.

40:37.868 --> 40:40.236
-I, Brian, -[priest]
...take you, Natalia...

40:40.271 --> 40:42.305
- [Brian] ...take you, Natalia...
- [priest] ...to be my wife.

40:42.339 --> 40:43.373
[Brian] ...to be my wife.

40:43.407 --> 40:44.374
[priest] To have and to hold...

40:44.408 --> 40:45.408
To have and to hold...

40:45.443 --> 40:46.543
[priest]
...from this day forward...

40:46.577 --> 40:48.011
...from this day forward...

40:48.045 --> 40:49.746
- I, Natalia...
- [priest] ...take you, Brian...

40:49.780 --> 40:50.980
...take you, Brian...

40:51.015 --> 40:53.516
- [priest] ...to be my husband...
- ...to be my husband...

40:53.551 --> 40:56.386
- ...to have and to hold...
- ...to have and to hold

40:56.420 --> 40:57.754
until we are parted by death.

40:57.788 --> 41:00.890
- As God is my witness...
- As God is my witness...

41:00.925 --> 41:04.761
- ...I give you my promise.
- ...I give you my promise.

41:04.795 --> 41:06.296
[priest] Brian,
you may kiss your bride.

41:06.330 --> 41:12.769
[all cheering]

41:12.803 --> 41:14.270
[Natalia]<i> It feels incredible,</i>

41:14.305 --> 41:19.776
<i>I'm overwhelmed with joy, and
peace, and so much love in my heart.</i>

41:19.810 --> 41:21.911
[Brian]<i> It feels incredible.</i>
<i>I... There's nothing like it.</i>

41:21.946 --> 41:23.746
- [Natalia] Yes.
- [Brian] To marry the woman of my dreams

41:23.781 --> 41:26.349
is just... There's no...
Can't put it into words.

41:37.461 --> 41:39.762
All right.
Last time in this dress.

41:39.797 --> 41:41.798
It was perfect
for the day, beautiful.

41:41.832 --> 41:44.400
<i>But I'm ready to change
into my reception dress.</i>

41:44.435 --> 41:46.970
[upbeat music playing]

41:58.916 --> 42:02.352
[Natalia]<i> The dress is
beautiful. It fits perfectly.</i>

42:02.386 --> 42:03.553
<i>I'm so excited.</i>

42:03.587 --> 42:06.656
- I thought Natalia was in the bathroom.
- [both chuckle]

42:06.690 --> 42:08.258
- [Brian]<i> Uh...</i>
- [Natalia]<i> I told him I was in the bathroom,</i>

42:08.292 --> 42:10.760
<i>so that he wouldn't know the
surprise. He wouldn't think anything of it.</i>

42:10.794 --> 42:12.896
I mean, I didn't see it
coming. I'm so surprised

42:12.930 --> 42:16.466
<i>by the change of outfits. I... It's
not something that I expected at all.</i>

42:16.500 --> 42:19.202
And it was just...
Caught me totally off-guard.

42:20.271 --> 42:21.304
Best surprise of the night.

42:21.338 --> 42:22.338
- And you love it?
- I do.

42:22.373 --> 42:23.273
Thank you.
