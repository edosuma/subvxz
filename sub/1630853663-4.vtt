00:01.835 --> 00:04.003
<i>We want to help find Bunny's killer.</i>

00:04.003 --> 00:06.757
- As the new board president,
I'm in charge now.

00:06.757 --> 00:09.718
- Someone's sure itchy to step into
the presidential wedgies.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.887
- The Arconia needs to be brought
into the 21st century.

00:11.887 --> 00:14.348
<i>The Arconia held little secrets</i>

00:14.348 --> 00:16.433
<i>known only to the architect himself.</i>

00:16.433 --> 00:17.809
- I'm not stepping down.

00:17.809 --> 00:20.229
<i>We need to find out more about Nina.</i>

00:20.229 --> 00:22.189
- Willy! Charles, this is my son Will.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.899
<i>Directing is my day job,</i>

00:23.899 --> 00:26.276
but my family, they're my passion.

00:26.276 --> 00:29.321
<i>We survived an implicit death threat
from Teddy Dimas.</i>

00:29.321 --> 00:30.614
<i>You're accusing the Deli King?</i>

00:30.614 --> 00:33.075
- Is this an offer? I'm Brazzos again?

00:33.075 --> 00:34.076
- Uncle Brazzos.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.661
We're picked up for series already.

00:35.661 --> 00:38.038
<i>Sometimes,
I can smell that omelet you make.</i>

00:38.038 --> 00:39.289
<i>Reminds me of Lucy.</i>

00:39.289 --> 00:41.291
<i>- Have you heard from her?</i>

01:16.660 --> 01:18.996
- You still got it!

01:23.375 --> 01:25.752
- <i>Is the hat wrong? Eh.</i>

01:25.752 --> 01:28.005
<i>Okay, I don't care.
I'm just gonna leave it.</i>

01:29.882 --> 01:31.425
<i>Yeah, nope.</i>

01:36.847 --> 01:38.807
<i>So. Yeah.</i>

01:38.807 --> 01:42.269
<i>Returning someplace after a long time</i>

01:42.269 --> 01:44.021
<i>can be weird.</i>

01:45.939 --> 01:47.149
<i>And I guess</i>

01:47.149 --> 01:50.569
<i>how you ended up coming back and why</i>

01:50.569 --> 01:53.197
<i>has a lot to do with how weird it gets.</i>

02:09.004 --> 02:10.923
- Still works.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.595
Still. Works.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.518
Still.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.478
Still!

02:25.854 --> 02:27.231
Still!

02:28.440 --> 02:29.691
Works.

02:30.526 --> 02:31.735
Works!

03:02.683 --> 03:04.184
Bet?

03:14.987 --> 03:17.906
<i>And as hard as it can be to go back...</i>

03:19.491 --> 03:21.994
sometimes, you have nowhere else to go.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.586
- First team on set?

03:30.586 --> 03:32.546
<i>First team on set. Copy that.</i>

03:32.546 --> 03:35.340
- Alright! Ladies and gentlemen,

03:35.340 --> 03:38.051
Charles-Haden Savage!

03:42.055 --> 03:43.849
- Well, thank you!

03:43.849 --> 03:46.435
Thank you very much! Thank you so much!

03:46.435 --> 03:47.895
Tony! I worked with your dad!

03:47.895 --> 03:49.771
- Oh, hey!
- Thank you!

03:53.859 --> 03:55.652
- Cool. Let's go for blocking!

03:55.652 --> 03:58.906
- You know, I wasn't sure
this day would ever come.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.700
I wasn't sure I'd ever be back here,

04:01.700 --> 04:03.452
on the set of <i>Brazzos</i>.

04:03.452 --> 04:06.830
- Well, you've made it.
- And get to finish a story

04:06.830 --> 04:10.501
and revisit a character
that means so much not only to me,

04:10.501 --> 04:12.294
but to the United States,

04:12.294 --> 04:14.296
Canada, and Brazil.

04:14.296 --> 04:16.924
- Totally. So, cool. Now, if you're ready,

04:16.924 --> 04:18.842
let's have you take a seat
in the wheelchair.

04:18.842 --> 04:19.843
Yeah.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.428
W-wheelchair?

04:22.221 --> 04:23.764
I didn't see wheelchair in the script.

04:23.764 --> 04:24.973
- Oh, did you not get the new pages?

04:25.974 --> 04:28.727
The studio added some things
for your character.

04:28.727 --> 04:31.647
Nothing huge. A wheelchair.
Touch of dementia.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.106
- Dementia?

04:33.565 --> 04:36.568
- It's this murder case
you're involved in.

04:37.861 --> 04:41.365
The studio needs to cover their ass,
be able to write you out

04:41.365 --> 04:42.533
in case you go to prison.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.409
- I'm not going to prison.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.954
And I didn't prepare a <i>touch</i> of dementia.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.456
I need five minutes.
- Wait, but everything's all set up here--

04:49.456 --> 04:51.750
- No, this is a big thing
to spring on somebody!

04:52.543 --> 04:54.127
- W-w-wait--

04:54.127 --> 04:56.129
- Touch of dementia.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.011
- This an okay time?

05:04.471 --> 05:05.973
- Lucy?

06:00.944 --> 06:03.989
- Listen, Will, I-I'm not going to be able
to make your rehearsal today.

06:03.989 --> 06:05.240
- Look, Dad, please.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.326
I-I need some help.
I'm drowning over here.

06:07.326 --> 06:09.703
<i>I don't know how to direct.
I don't know what the hell I'm doing.</i>

06:09.703 --> 06:10.954
- I understand.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.915
I'm just ridiculously jammed
with this case.

06:12.915 --> 06:14.499
<i>No, you don't understand, alright?</i>

06:14.499 --> 06:16.585
I got set pieces
flying in and out of here,

06:16.585 --> 06:18.670
<i>I got screaming children
for six straight hours,</i>

06:18.670 --> 06:21.798
and I'm not 100% sure,
but I think the Tin Man has pinkeye.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.885
- Honey, no one cares about
the Tin Man in <i>The Wizard Of Oz.</i>

06:24.885 --> 06:26.762
Just make the fattest kid the lion.

06:26.762 --> 06:27.971
It'll kill.
<i>Wait, Dad,</i>

06:27.971 --> 06:29.723
- you don't under--
- <i>I'm gonna call you later.</i>

06:33.101 --> 06:34.645
- Thanks...

06:34.645 --> 06:35.979
- Could you hold that, please?

06:40.275 --> 06:41.360
- Oliver.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.030
Come in.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.075
- Wha-- Teddy, I'll just get another one.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.826
- Oh, don't be silly. I insist.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.454
- Okay.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.959
- How are you?
- I-I'm... I-I'm good.

07:02.214 --> 07:03.715
You're back.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.969
- For a few months. Awaiting trial.

07:06.969 --> 07:08.679
- Ah. I see.

07:13.308 --> 07:16.270
So... how was prison?

07:22.651 --> 07:24.444
- Actually...

07:24.444 --> 07:25.571
Transformative.

07:26.572 --> 07:29.283
I don't know if you know Master Han,

07:29.283 --> 07:31.660
but he's helped me realize...

07:32.452 --> 07:34.997
I don't have to act on my thoughts.

07:34.997 --> 07:35.914
- Ah.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.876
- For example, right now,

07:38.876 --> 07:40.752
the thought of wringing your neck

07:40.752 --> 07:43.172
really stimulates my root chakra,

07:43.172 --> 07:46.842
but it's probably not worth losing
three of my mindfulness badges.

07:46.842 --> 07:47.926
- Ah.

07:49.845 --> 07:51.847
- Th-that's... That's good...

07:54.141 --> 07:55.851
And how, how is Theo?

07:56.768 --> 07:59.521
- Also awaiting.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.773
And angry.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.734
He's coming by later to discuss

08:03.734 --> 08:06.320
how best to use
those feelings productively.

08:08.405 --> 08:11.408
- Well, that-that's--
that sounds good, too. Just...

08:12.618 --> 08:15.662
taking it all in stride.
That's...

08:15.662 --> 08:16.955
That's all good.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.252
- That's me.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.879
- Well, I guess I'll see you around.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.591
- Oh, definitely.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.760
Because I'm going to fuck you, Oliver.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.847
- Excuse me?
- I'm going to fuck you.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.807
I'm not sure...

08:35.807 --> 08:38.310
when or how quite yet,

08:39.061 --> 08:41.063
but I'm going to fuck you.

08:41.897 --> 08:42.981
Hard.

08:42.981 --> 08:45.567
Harder than you've ever
been fucked before.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.778
In a way you won't see coming.

08:47.778 --> 08:49.446
Until one day,

08:49.446 --> 08:52.282
you'll slip your nubby little fingers
into one of my dips

08:52.282 --> 08:55.077
you love so much and realize...

08:56.078 --> 08:57.579
you're choking.

08:58.580 --> 09:02.084
Choking on a big heaping bowl...

09:03.001 --> 09:05.295
of fuck.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.260
<i>Namaste.</i>

09:23.438 --> 09:25.107
- So, what are you--
- So, what are-- Uh...

09:25.107 --> 09:28.235
- No, no, you first. You--
- No, no, you first.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.903
- I mean, what brings you to Manhattan?

09:29.903 --> 09:32.698
I mean, I'm assuming you have cooler
things to do than just see your old--

09:32.698 --> 09:35.617
- To see m-my super cool TV star
ex-dad sort of person?

09:38.203 --> 09:39.788
No, I, uh...

09:39.788 --> 09:41.832
I have a three-day weekend
because they found out

09:41.832 --> 09:44.209
that the AP chem teacher was cooking GHB

09:44.209 --> 09:45.335
on school property,

09:45.335 --> 09:47.296
and also operating a NXIVM-style sex cult.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.885
I-I also figured
it was a good opportunity

09:52.885 --> 09:56.597
to escape dystopian Connecticut
and culture-up in Manhatty.

09:58.682 --> 10:00.851
- Oh, th-that's, uh...

10:00.851 --> 10:02.853
Well, that's, um...

10:03.937 --> 10:05.480
You excited for your mom's wedding?

10:06.106 --> 10:07.149
- Uh, it happened.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.860
Like, two weeks ago.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.361
- Oh.

10:12.696 --> 10:13.697
Was it nice?

10:14.406 --> 10:17.534
- Nice is a... a word.

10:18.702 --> 10:21.330
- Ah, he still hasn't figured out
his new lock, I see.

10:21.330 --> 10:22.706
Well, Teddy's back!

10:22.706 --> 10:24.708
He's already plotting his revenge.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.294
I think he's gonna kill me,
bury me, dig me up, and kill me again.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.922
We need to deal with Nina.
Howard DM'ed me

10:29.922 --> 10:33.217
saying he has some "hot goss" on her,
and he'll be here any min...

10:34.176 --> 10:36.428
- Lucy. Uh, Oliver, Mabel.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.556
Lucy!

10:39.556 --> 10:41.099
- Oh my god, Lucy! Hi!

10:41.099 --> 10:43.060
- Wow! How sweet.

10:43.060 --> 10:45.771
We've heard-- well, more about you
than anyone else from Charles' past.

10:45.771 --> 10:48.398
You and his dead mysterious father.
It's a tie.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.484
- It is so cool to meet you.
I've heard your podcast,

10:50.484 --> 10:52.236
but I usually, like,
listen to it on two times speed,

10:52.236 --> 10:54.112
and your voices are so much
deeper than I thought.

10:55.781 --> 10:57.533
- I love those pants. I had a pair--
- Hey,

10:57.533 --> 10:59.785
can I talk to you two for just a minute?
Sure. Absolutely.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.787
- You can play games on your telephone.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.332
- What is she doing here?
- I don't know.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.667
She says "just to hang."

11:06.667 --> 11:09.378
I wanted this so badly,
but I'm so unprepared.

11:09.378 --> 11:13.215
I mean, sh-she's an older person now,
and she brought a bag.

11:13.215 --> 11:15.759
- Ooh...
- Does that mean she wants to stay?

11:15.759 --> 11:18.220
I don't understand things she says.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.514
Can you talk to her
and just find out anything?

11:20.514 --> 11:22.182
- Why? Because I'm a girl?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.767
- No! Because you're young.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.727
She used the word "Manhatty,"

11:25.727 --> 11:27.729
and you just used "hot goss."

11:27.729 --> 11:30.566
It's like I'm watching
<i>Squid Games</i> without subtitles.

11:30.566 --> 11:32.526
Just... I'll give you $200.

11:32.526 --> 11:35.612
- I'll do it free of charge.
$200 on the Upper West Side

11:35.612 --> 11:37.865
will just get me a bagel and a soy latte.

11:37.865 --> 11:40.242
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

11:42.286 --> 11:45.873
- Hey, Luce! Uh, maybe you and Mabel, uh,
can get to know each other a little bit,

11:45.873 --> 11:49.293
uh, while Oliver and I, uh,
do our adult business, uh, you know,

11:49.293 --> 11:51.795
conversation thing in the other room.
- Oh.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.511
- Hey, girl.
- Hey.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.181
Is it just me,
or did "adult business thing"

12:02.181 --> 12:03.515
sound kinda queer-coded?

12:03.515 --> 12:05.559
- More like old-coded. So--

12:05.559 --> 12:07.519
- It is so beyond that Charles
is friends with you.

12:07.519 --> 12:10.230
I mean, you are literally one of the
coolest people on the internet right now.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.440
- Oh...
- Seriously, Bloody Mabel

12:11.440 --> 12:12.774
is, like, my favorite thing to happen

12:12.774 --> 12:14.860
since those baby witches
tried to hex the moon.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.486
They tore. Anyway,

12:16.486 --> 12:19.156
I uploaded you on the DAZED 100.
- On, uh, what?

12:19.156 --> 12:22.284
- Your story is, like, just--
It's really, really inspiring.

12:22.284 --> 12:24.161
Have you seen all that stuff
on Mental Health TikTok?

12:24.161 --> 12:25.579
- Uh...

12:25.579 --> 12:27.706
No. So, what brings you to Charles?

12:27.706 --> 12:30.751
- Yeah, so this TikToker, he made,
like, this whole timeline of your life,

12:30.751 --> 12:34.213
and then cross-references the various
deaths, murders, etc., with the DSM-5.

12:34.213 --> 12:35.714
Anyway, you are so lucky.

12:35.714 --> 12:39.551
It's probably, like, so easy for you to
get, like, xannies and Klonopin and stuff.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.638
I prayed to the 100 Gecs tree
to get a real diagnosis,

12:42.638 --> 12:45.474
but my mom, she, like,
hates Big Pharma, so...

12:47.476 --> 12:50.687
- Guys? Is the adult business
concluded? Please?

12:50.687 --> 12:52.731
I'll give you $200.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.316
- Hey, lookie what I found.

12:54.316 --> 12:57.027
Charles said
it's an old favorite of Lucy's.

12:57.027 --> 12:59.279
- Is that you?

13:01.114 --> 13:02.157
- Oh my god...

13:11.708 --> 13:13.126
- It's omelet time, Lucy!

13:13.126 --> 13:15.712
Just like the old days!
Here comes the pepper.

13:15.712 --> 13:16.797
Here comes the pepper!

13:18.423 --> 13:20.092
- You know, this hil-- You know,

13:20.092 --> 13:23.387
I'm such a huge fan of terrible music.
How have I never heard this?

13:23.387 --> 13:24.805
- Do you have a perm?
- Yeah, well,

13:24.805 --> 13:26.014
make fun of it all you want,

13:26.014 --> 13:27.391
but it was a big hit in Germany.

13:27.391 --> 13:29.434
It went to number 83 on the charts.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.729
And then the Berlin Wall fell,
and that stopped its upward momentum.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.316
- Wait, why is this so familiar?

13:36.316 --> 13:37.317
- Oh. Wait for it.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.653
- This was sampled by, like, 50 rap stars.

13:41.905 --> 13:44.449
- My god, that is you! I know this!

13:44.449 --> 13:47.494
- Yeah, it was used by, uh,
by Post Malone and, uh, Missy Elliott.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.496
- Yeah, and Del the Funky Homosapien.
- Good God,

13:49.496 --> 13:51.123
how much money have you made from this?

13:51.123 --> 13:53.125
- I made about, uh...

13:53.584 --> 13:55.335
200 grand a year.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.337
Yeah, you're gonna be okay.
Okay, big finish!

14:01.884 --> 14:03.635
Pitta putta.

14:05.554 --> 14:07.347
- Oh god, do you not wash these?

14:11.810 --> 14:13.812
What?
- Is that blood?

14:16.356 --> 14:17.858
- Charles, please tell me

14:17.858 --> 14:20.110
that you butchered a hog
in your kitchen last night.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.112
- Holy shit. Is this the murder weapon?

14:22.779 --> 14:25.157
- Hold on. This is mine!
- Hey, don't touch it!

14:25.157 --> 14:26.950
Fingerprints!
- Oh.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.829
- Th-this is my opening night gift
from <i>Macbeats,</i>

14:30.829 --> 14:33.373
my 1991 musical of <i>Macbeth</i>
starring Vanilla Ice.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.585
- What's gonna show up next?
Body parts in a freezer?

14:36.585 --> 14:37.711
- What are you guys talking about?

14:37.711 --> 14:40.005
- Evidence keeps showing up
in our apartments,

14:40.005 --> 14:41.882
and we don't know how. I mean, first,

14:41.882 --> 14:43.842
the painting over there,
now the murder weapon?

14:44.968 --> 14:47.513
- Lucy, you cannot be involved in this.

14:47.513 --> 14:49.181
You have to go. Now. Sorry.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.392
- Fine. I'll go.

14:53.143 --> 14:54.186
To the bathroom.

14:55.145 --> 14:56.980
- Okay, w-what is going on?

14:56.980 --> 14:58.732
- She cannot be a part of this.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.609
Now her fingerprints
are on the murder weapon?

15:00.609 --> 15:02.486
I'm gonna run it through the dishwasher.
No--

15:02.486 --> 15:04.655
- Wait! My fingerprints aren't on it!

15:04.655 --> 15:06.740
This could prove I'm innocent!
- Guys, stop!

15:06.740 --> 15:10.244
Please, just think here.
Who's ever doing this

15:10.244 --> 15:11.954
is clearly toying with us.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.580
I mean, if it was simply
about getting us caught,

15:13.580 --> 15:15.332
the police would be banging down that do--

15:16.750 --> 15:19.002
Why am I holding this knife?!

15:22.548 --> 15:24.216
- Oh, good. It's open.

15:24.216 --> 15:25.467
Guys, listen.

15:25.467 --> 15:28.762
I am so sorry.
I know that I promised hot goss, but...

15:28.762 --> 15:30.472
this is really...

15:30.472 --> 15:31.974
it's more of a confession.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.561
I was not truthful about the way

15:35.561 --> 15:37.938
I obtained my injury
the night of Bunny's death.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.189
Nina Lin punched me!

15:39.857 --> 15:41.400
She is violent,

15:41.400 --> 15:42.860
and after backstabbing Bunny,

15:42.860 --> 15:45.654
I think she might have
front stabbed her, too.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.114
She will cut a bitch.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.616
You can use that in the podcast.

15:52.494 --> 15:53.787
Why are you all looking at me--

15:53.787 --> 15:56.915
- Thanks for the hot goss, Howard.
We gotta digest that.

15:56.915 --> 15:58.166
- You could have just texted us,

15:58.166 --> 15:59.418
of course.
- Oh, please.

15:59.418 --> 16:02.462
I heard the episode where you
hacked into Tim Kono's phone.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.922
Not that you would ever guess <i>my</i> password.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.048
- Is it "Evelyn"?

16:07.718 --> 16:09.261
- No.

16:09.261 --> 16:10.971
Good day.

16:14.308 --> 16:16.935
- Alright. So, Nina Lin
has a violent streak?

16:23.483 --> 16:25.235
- Lucy! Everything okay in there?!

16:25.235 --> 16:27.613
- Maybe give her some privacy.
- Just a minute!

16:33.410 --> 16:34.912
- You know, when I was a kid,

16:34.912 --> 16:37.539
and I was in the bathroom too long,

16:37.539 --> 16:39.541
my grammy would knock
on the door and say,

16:39.541 --> 16:42.002
"Oliver?
Would you like me to come in there

16:42.002 --> 16:44.505
and rub some Vaseline on your rectum?"

16:49.885 --> 16:51.386
You can come in!

17:07.986 --> 17:10.614
I think I know how people
are getting into your apartment.

17:16.662 --> 17:19.164
- My god...

17:36.807 --> 17:38.100
- How do you know about these?

17:38.100 --> 17:40.978
- I used to play hide and seek
with Anaya from across the hall.

17:40.978 --> 17:43.647
- Oh, right. You two got competitive.

17:43.647 --> 17:45.148
Oh...

17:47.484 --> 17:51.154
These must have been used during
Prohibition for moving contraband.

17:52.155 --> 17:55.158
- Or for perving.
- Ooh! Let me see.

17:59.288 --> 18:01.582
See, this is why I don't exercise.

18:02.457 --> 18:04.626
- Why is that?
- 'Cause you look like that.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.587
He's sweating like Winnie
after a 10-foot walk.

18:09.631 --> 18:12.342
- None of these passageways
are on the building plans.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.678
It's so strange.
Strange?

18:14.678 --> 18:17.848
Is that all?
You've been living here for 30 years.

18:17.848 --> 18:20.350
Aren't you wondering
what people see of you?

18:20.350 --> 18:23.312
- Oh, he doesn't do anything.
Trust me, no one's seen anything.

18:23.312 --> 18:26.190
In a shocking development,

18:26.190 --> 18:28.984
we've discovered...
the killer's secret lair.

18:29.651 --> 18:33.030
What lies at the center
of these "Arcatacombs"?

18:35.407 --> 18:37.367
- Oh! Uh, don't go that way.
- Why not?

18:37.367 --> 18:40.913
It's a dead end. You should follow me.
- Follow you?

18:40.913 --> 18:43.665
You're not a part of this.
I am calling your mother.

18:43.665 --> 18:46.668
- Uh, she does not wanna see me.
Not after I skipped her wedding.

18:48.045 --> 18:49.755
- You skipped her wedding?
- Okay,

18:49.755 --> 18:51.757
can we do family therapy later?

18:51.757 --> 18:54.676
'Cause we're <i>literally</i> crawling
through the walls like rats.

18:54.676 --> 18:56.845
Lucy, how well do you know
these passageways?

18:56.845 --> 18:58.889
- Don't answer that.
She is not a part of this.

18:58.889 --> 19:01.058
- Of course, she isn't.
Lucy, you are <i>not</i> a part of this.

19:01.058 --> 19:03.060
But, if you were, hypothetically,

19:03.060 --> 19:05.062
would you know how
I'd get to the sixth floor?

19:06.146 --> 19:09.107
- There's, uh, a maintenance ladder
that runs next to a secret elevator

19:09.107 --> 19:11.527
on the A-line. Hypothetically.

19:11.527 --> 19:13.195
- Thank you.
- Hey.

19:14.238 --> 19:15.531
Where are you going?

19:15.531 --> 19:17.658
- Well, if Teddy's plotting to screw me,

19:17.658 --> 19:19.701
I at least want to know what to wear.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.912
- I like him.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.681
Nina? You in here, honey?

19:45.435 --> 19:46.603
Nina?

19:54.361 --> 19:55.612
There you are.

19:56.405 --> 19:58.657
- Who's the neck?
- I don't know.

19:58.657 --> 20:00.158
Business guy?

20:00.158 --> 20:01.660
An MMA fighter?

20:01.660 --> 20:04.997
A super-hot MMA fighter
in a business suit?

20:06.123 --> 20:07.374
- What's wrong, baby?

20:07.374 --> 20:09.585
It sounds like it's her baby daddy.

20:09.585 --> 20:11.545
I can't stop thinking about Bunny.

20:12.087 --> 20:13.839
We're doing the right thing, right?

20:14.756 --> 20:16.717
- You know as well as I do.

20:17.551 --> 20:19.094
She had to go.

20:19.845 --> 20:22.264
- Bunny had to go?
- You're right.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.807
Once we get that board vote,

20:23.807 --> 20:25.809
we're home free, honey.

20:25.809 --> 20:27.394
- God, I love you.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.271
- I love you too, baby.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.815
- Wait, look in the corner over there.

20:32.733 --> 20:34.526
Mm. You smell good.

20:35.319 --> 20:38.947
Are they cutting some sort of deal
to change the Arconia?

20:38.947 --> 20:41.825
- By putting in a giant space pod on top?

20:41.825 --> 20:44.536
- Bunny never would have allowed that.

20:44.536 --> 20:47.956
- That's why Bunny had to go.

20:50.334 --> 20:52.628
- Oh...

20:52.628 --> 20:55.130
- Whoa. Okay.
- This is unethical.

20:57.674 --> 20:59.718
- Hey. You still get a bloody nose.

20:59.718 --> 21:00.719
- Oh...

21:00.719 --> 21:02.471
Are you sure this is okay? With the baby?

21:02.471 --> 21:04.473
- Oh, it's fine.
- God...

21:18.654 --> 21:20.489
Theo, stop obsessing.

21:21.281 --> 21:22.824
Stop obsessing, please!

21:24.409 --> 21:27.204
We can fix this, alright?
You just have to trust me!

21:30.415 --> 21:32.709
Theo? Theo!

21:34.002 --> 21:37.214
Everything I did was to protect you.

21:39.550 --> 21:41.176
What? Don't say that.

21:41.176 --> 21:42.594
You're my boy!

21:46.390 --> 21:47.516
What?

21:48.475 --> 21:52.354
You got your own lawyer now?

21:53.146 --> 21:54.147
Theo!

21:54.147 --> 21:56.650
Theo! I'm the only one

21:56.650 --> 21:58.777
who's been looking out for your interests!

21:58.777 --> 22:01.572
- You're killing me!

22:03.031 --> 22:05.534
I have no life anymore!

22:15.377 --> 22:18.297
- Theo. I'm sorry.

22:18.755 --> 22:22.050
I love you... so much.

22:23.594 --> 22:26.471
You're... all...

22:26.471 --> 22:29.474
I care about in this world.

22:32.311 --> 22:33.812
Theo--

22:59.588 --> 23:01.089
Theo!

23:02.633 --> 23:05.177
You're my...
- Oh Jesus.

23:12.935 --> 23:14.686
- What did you find out about Teddy?

23:14.686 --> 23:16.271
- Nothing.

23:16.271 --> 23:18.607
Except I saw him weep.

23:20.234 --> 23:23.612
It was like watching Darth Vader
take off his helmet.

23:23.612 --> 23:25.489
I-I'm in a total state of shock.

23:25.489 --> 23:26.990
I really am.

23:26.990 --> 23:28.992
And I've never wanted to hug my son more.

23:30.827 --> 23:31.912
Anyway, what did I miss?

23:31.912 --> 23:35.123
- Nina wants to profit by putting
a giant space pod on our building.

23:35.123 --> 23:37.125
Yeah, and Bunny said no,

23:37.125 --> 23:38.418
so Nina killed her.

23:38.418 --> 23:39.962
- But we didn't record any of that,

23:39.962 --> 23:41.839
so now, we have to figure out
how do we nail her.

23:41.839 --> 23:42.589
Hey.

23:43.340 --> 23:46.426
I mean, just record her then.

23:46.426 --> 23:48.178
Nina's super hormonal.

23:48.178 --> 23:50.264
Seems like she's right on the edge, so

23:50.264 --> 23:52.140
just give her a little push.

23:58.856 --> 24:00.858
Hi!

24:00.858 --> 24:02.901
- We just came to say cheers
on the new presidency

24:02.901 --> 24:04.486
and give you a gift for your new baby!
Oh.

24:04.486 --> 24:05.988
- It's just a few artisanal things

24:05.988 --> 24:07.781
we threw together,
something from each of us.

24:07.781 --> 24:09.366
Um, thank you.

24:09.366 --> 24:11.952
A can of... vegan tuna,

24:11.952 --> 24:13.245
a blanket...

24:13.245 --> 24:15.289
baby oil, and a tennis ball.

24:15.289 --> 24:16.290
That's wet...

24:16.290 --> 24:19.501
- That's because I... washed it.
Just for you.

24:20.127 --> 24:22.129
We just wanted to see
how you were doing, you know,

24:22.129 --> 24:24.882
with the baby coming
right on the heels of losing

24:24.882 --> 24:27.885
your beloved mentor on the board.

24:29.011 --> 24:30.012
- Oh god...

24:30.012 --> 24:31.930
- And we've got her.

24:31.930 --> 24:33.891
- The jig is up, Nina.

24:33.891 --> 24:35.642
Time to come clean.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.811
- Oh my god.

24:37.811 --> 24:39.188
I need Jared.

24:39.188 --> 24:42.024
He's out getting last-minute baby things.
He can't save you.

24:42.024 --> 24:43.525
No one can save you now.

24:43.525 --> 24:44.860
You feel bad?

24:44.860 --> 24:47.779
Well, you should! Spill it! Spill it!

24:47.779 --> 24:49.698
- Ooh!

24:50.824 --> 24:52.868
Ah!

24:52.868 --> 24:55.495
- Oh my god! What is happening?!

24:55.495 --> 24:57.664
- Oh my god, it's coming!

24:57.664 --> 24:59.291
What do I do?
- Ah!

24:59.291 --> 25:01.835
- Okay, okay. Here. Here.
- No, no, no! Th-that's Winnie's blanket!

25:01.835 --> 25:03.712
- Listen. Listen. Hey, call 911.

25:03.712 --> 25:05.339
Get a chair. Get a chair.

25:05.339 --> 25:06.757
Here. Come on, this way.
Let's just sit.

25:09.343 --> 25:11.762
Here. Just squeeze this.

25:11.762 --> 25:13.430
Squeeze this with your hand.
Put this in your hand.

25:13.430 --> 25:15.057
Squeeze this. That's right.

25:15.057 --> 25:16.934
And now just breathe. Rapid.

25:20.395 --> 25:22.814
- Oh my god. What if I'm a bad mom?

25:22.814 --> 25:25.275
- What? No! You won't be!

25:25.275 --> 25:28.195
- But, why would you think that?
Is it because you've done bad things?

25:28.195 --> 25:29.446
- Not now! Put that away!

25:29.446 --> 25:31.406
Nina, look at me.

25:31.406 --> 25:32.282
Look at me.
- Mm?

25:32.282 --> 25:34.368
- It's going to be okay.

25:34.368 --> 25:37.371
Yeah. Hey. Hey,
who is that in that photo?

25:39.748 --> 25:41.041
- My mom.
- Oh, really?

25:41.041 --> 25:42.626
Was she a good mom?

25:43.168 --> 25:44.795
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah? And why is that?

25:46.171 --> 25:48.590
- She was... there for me.

25:48.590 --> 25:51.802
She cared.
- Right.

25:51.802 --> 25:54.680
And so will you.
I mean, you'll make mistakes.

25:54.680 --> 25:57.724
I mean, this won't be the last time
your kid will scare the shit out of you.

25:57.724 --> 26:00.394
But everything's going to be okay.

26:00.394 --> 26:03.355
And all the hard parts will be worth it.
I promise.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.194
Just breathe. Breathe, breathe, breathe.

26:09.987 --> 26:11.113
Yeah.

26:18.078 --> 26:19.663
I wish Bunny were here.

26:20.581 --> 26:23.125
She was so excited to see this kid.

26:23.125 --> 26:24.751
Look at me!

26:24.751 --> 26:27.462
You find her murderer

26:27.462 --> 26:30.883
and give me five minutes in a room
with that motherfucker once you do!

26:35.137 --> 26:38.098
- Okay. Okay, there's a chance
I may have to deliver this baby,

26:38.098 --> 26:41.101
but don't worry. I once played
an obstetric anesthesiologist

26:41.101 --> 26:42.394
on a show called <i>The Deliverer.</i>

26:42.394 --> 26:44.855
And on that show,
every baby was born healthy!

26:48.859 --> 26:50.235
Oh, thank God.

26:50.235 --> 26:51.278
- Oh, Jesus.

26:51.278 --> 26:53.238
- Take over. Ah!

26:53.238 --> 26:55.866
Do I deliver or do I <i>deliver</i>?

26:57.201 --> 26:58.535
That was the line from <i>The Deliverer.</i>

26:58.535 --> 27:00.329
- Oh Jesus...

27:03.540 --> 27:05.834
- You know, it's weird to think...

27:05.834 --> 27:07.920
what if things had gone differently?

27:07.920 --> 27:10.797
14C would still be my front door.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.382
That guy would be my dad,

27:12.382 --> 27:14.593
taking me on college visits,

27:14.593 --> 27:16.428
worrying if I had an eating disorder,

27:16.428 --> 27:19.431
getting it wrong when I
inevitably change my pronouns.

27:22.434 --> 27:24.269
- I get missing a really good dad.

27:26.230 --> 27:29.191
I lost mine when I was really young.

27:30.943 --> 27:34.571
Charles reminds me of him sometimes.
I think.

27:36.990 --> 27:39.243
You can be honest with him.

27:40.369 --> 27:41.411
Tell him the truth.

27:43.497 --> 27:44.540
- What do you mean?

27:45.249 --> 27:47.709
- You came here for a reason,
didn't you, Lucy?

27:49.086 --> 27:50.587
He knows that, too.

27:53.465 --> 27:55.592
Just tell him whatever it is.

28:07.104 --> 28:09.565
- Well, that was a day.

28:10.566 --> 28:13.569
I saw a deaf son silently
destroy his father.

28:14.820 --> 28:18.198
I watched Charles give a Lifetime TV movie
speech about parenting,

28:18.198 --> 28:20.409
which actually moved me.

28:20.409 --> 28:22.452
- We got a bunch of pervs watching us.

28:22.452 --> 28:24.246
I need to board up my apartment.

28:24.997 --> 28:26.206
- What else?

28:28.000 --> 28:31.003
Oh, right. The murder weapon
in the ceiling.

28:31.753 --> 28:33.463
- Well, that's my cue.

28:33.463 --> 28:36.383
And I know exactly
where I need to be right now.

28:39.052 --> 28:42.139
- You gonna get rid of that?
- Don't you worry.

28:42.139 --> 28:44.600
- I'm so fucking worried.
Luce, it's been real.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.018
Later!
Yeah. So real.

28:46.018 --> 28:47.644
And don't be a stranger, dog.

28:48.645 --> 28:51.440
Don't ever say that again.

28:53.483 --> 28:55.068
- Hey, could I ask you about Jan?

28:56.195 --> 28:57.988
- Oh, boy. Here we go.

28:57.988 --> 28:59.489
- No, no. Uh...

29:00.407 --> 29:02.701
No, I just wanted to say that, uh,

29:02.701 --> 29:04.870
when I was listening to your podcast,

29:04.870 --> 29:06.747
she seemed like a good match to me, too.

29:06.747 --> 29:09.750
So you shouldn't, you know,
feel embarrassed about that.

29:10.751 --> 29:11.877
You know, it always bummed me out,

29:11.877 --> 29:15.380
thinking about you being
alone after we left. And, uh...

29:15.380 --> 29:17.341
so, I'm-- What I'm trying to say
is that I just--

29:17.341 --> 29:19.051
I hope that you find somebody someday.

29:19.801 --> 29:23.222
And I get why Jan seemed right
before everything got all crazy.

29:24.640 --> 29:28.352
- Well, at least I managed to top how
things ended between your mom and me.

29:29.186 --> 29:31.980
- Yeah. Mom and I were fighting. Again.

29:32.773 --> 29:35.275
That's why I bailed on the wedding.

29:36.276 --> 29:37.945
She knows that I don't like him.

29:38.612 --> 29:39.780
I mean, it-it's not...

29:40.197 --> 29:42.699
it's not that he's a bad guy.
He's just not...

29:45.244 --> 29:48.205
- I'm sure he won't have you running
around a murder investigation.

29:50.582 --> 29:52.084
- You know, it wasn't easy.

29:53.210 --> 29:54.711
With her.

29:55.587 --> 29:56.797
Without you.

29:58.841 --> 30:00.926
You know, it was really, really nice

30:00.926 --> 30:03.554
to finally get a text from you,
but eight years is, like...

30:04.471 --> 30:06.306
That's, like, a really long time.

30:08.892 --> 30:10.018
- I'm sorry.

30:10.018 --> 30:12.437
I-I didn't know I was allowed.

30:12.437 --> 30:15.232
Your mom said no contact.

30:16.316 --> 30:17.693
- Well, you're allowed.

30:21.154 --> 30:22.447
- Okay.

30:24.366 --> 30:26.660
- So, you know, this, um...

30:26.660 --> 30:29.079
this is why, out of
the five dads that I have had,

30:29.079 --> 30:30.706
you are...

30:30.706 --> 30:33.041
you are by far my favorite.

30:34.251 --> 30:35.878
- I'll take that.

30:46.054 --> 30:47.556
- Pitta putta, pitta putta.

30:52.144 --> 30:54.313
- Kids! Let's get our head
in the game, alright?

30:54.313 --> 30:55.772
The yellow tape equals

30:55.772 --> 30:58.066
the Yellow Brick Road. Follow it.

30:58.066 --> 30:59.902
Nobody's even listening to me.

30:59.902 --> 31:02.529
- Well, if it isn't the greatest director
in North Jersey.

31:02.529 --> 31:04.531
- Hey, Dorothy.

31:04.531 --> 31:08.160
- Will, you put
a skinny kid in the lion suit?

31:08.160 --> 31:09.161
Do you listen at all?

31:09.161 --> 31:11.914
- Just please help.
- Hey, kids!

31:11.914 --> 31:15.125
I have a bag of Skittles for anyone
who stands on the Yellow Brick Road.

31:19.213 --> 31:20.756
This is what they used to do
with Judy Garland,

31:20.756 --> 31:22.049
except it was a bag of amphetamines.

31:22.049 --> 31:23.175
- Hmm.

31:24.801 --> 31:27.596
- Thank you for never
giving up on me, Willy.

31:30.224 --> 31:31.266
Ooh.

31:32.809 --> 31:35.354
- Oh shit. We're gonna need more Skittles.

31:35.354 --> 31:36.980
- There you go.

31:38.857 --> 31:41.485
- Straight to Connecticut. No detours!

31:45.030 --> 31:46.114
Um...

31:46.907 --> 31:48.283
Say hello to your mom for me.

31:49.409 --> 31:50.786
- Hey, um...

31:51.745 --> 31:54.414
You know the night of the wedding,
was the same night you got arrested.

31:55.791 --> 31:59.044
And instead of going to the church,
I-I tried coming here to see you.

32:01.630 --> 32:03.298
CHARLES At my place,

32:03.298 --> 32:05.384
I got a nice bottle of wine in the fridge.
MABEL No,

32:05.384 --> 32:08.011
we need champagne for a toast.

32:08.011 --> 32:10.681
I mean, look, you get the cheeses,

32:10.681 --> 32:12.808
Oliver's just gonna hoard all the dips

32:12.808 --> 32:15.310
so I guess I could do
something else, but...

32:24.152 --> 32:26.154
- Okay.

32:28.282 --> 32:30.868
- Should we do it at my place?
- Well, I have furniture.

32:38.125 --> 32:40.335
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

32:40.335 --> 32:42.588
I wouldn't have wanted you
anywhere near here that night.

33:08.113 --> 33:09.907
<i>So, yeah.</i>

33:09.907 --> 33:13.702
<i>Returning someplace after a long time</i>

33:13.702 --> 33:15.412
<i>can be weird.</i>

33:16.455 --> 33:19.541
Things seem smaller, emptier.

33:20.375 --> 33:23.545
<i>And I guess
how you ended up coming back</i>

33:23.545 --> 33:26.173
<i>and why has a lot to do</i>

33:26.173 --> 33:27.966
<i>with how weird things get.</i>

33:41.271 --> 33:42.272
Oh!

34:18.100 --> 34:20.727
You know, I really came here
because I'm worried about you.

34:20.727 --> 34:23.146
- You don't have to worry about me.
- No, I do.

34:23.146 --> 34:26.024
I do. There is some real shit going on
in this building, Charles,

34:26.024 --> 34:27.568
and you need to get tougher.

34:27.568 --> 34:30.279
You need to find them
before they find you.

34:33.073 --> 34:35.784
- This is the second time
recently I put someone in a car,

34:35.784 --> 34:37.703
feeling like they know more than I do.

34:37.703 --> 34:39.705
- I-I don't really know
what that means, but...

34:40.789 --> 34:43.542
maybe you should do something
about that feeling.

34:54.136 --> 34:55.179
- No detours!

35:25.042 --> 35:27.586
Well, unknown caller.

35:28.879 --> 35:30.380
I need your help with something.

35:33.592 --> 35:36.512
- Hello, Charles. I've missed you.
