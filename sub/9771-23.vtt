<i>Logan's really a friend,</i>

01:40.600 --> 01:41.851
<i>but he's good at volleyball,</i>

01:41.935 --> 01:43.686
<i>and we needed a sixth player.</i>

01:43.770 --> 01:44.938
<i>Anyway, we've been practicing</i>

01:45.021 --> 01:46.523
<i>for the past couple of weeks.</i>

01:48.066 --> 01:50.360
<i>Chase is pretty good,</i>

<i>ZOEY: Not our best player,</i>

01:57.492 --> 01:59.410

01:59.494 --> 02:01.704
- Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!

02:01.788 --> 02:03.039
<i>- Michael's good,</i>

02:03.122 --> 02:05.333
<i>but a little bit of a show-off.</i>

02:05.416 --> 02:06.918
- Yeah.

02:07.001 --> 02:09.838
<i>ZOEY: Quinn turns</i>

02:09.920 --> 02:11.214

02:11.297 --> 02:12.549
Yes.
- No way.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.300
<i>ZOEY: And Logan?</i>

02:14.384 --> 02:15.301
<i>I think Logan just likes</i>

02:15.385 --> 02:17.804
<i>having his shirt off.</i>

02:17.887 --> 02:19.514
- Logan?
- What are you doing?

02:19.597 --> 02:21.307
- You were supposed to hit that.
- Are you stupid?

02:23.518 --> 02:26.312
- Which brings us
to photosynthesis.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.064
Using sugar, light,

02:28.147 --> 02:29.524
and carbon dioxide,

02:29.607 --> 02:30.567
plants are able to produce

02:30.650 --> 02:31.568
the energy they need

02:31.651 --> 02:33.528
to sustain life.

02:33.611 --> 02:34.487
Now the by-product

02:34.571 --> 02:36.239
of this biochemical reaction

02:36.322 --> 02:40.243
is oxygen, which is good for us,

02:40.326 --> 02:41.661
because without oxygen,

02:41.744 --> 02:44.622
we'd all die
slow and painful deaths.

- Then what's the news?

04:01.741 --> 04:02.909

04:25.598 --> 04:26.766
- Maybe not.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.520
Do you want to come with us?

04:35.483 --> 04:37.193
- Covington Preparatory School?

04:37.276 --> 04:39.278

of the top five prep schools

04:39.362 --> 04:40.238
in the world.

04:40.321 --> 04:41.698
- And only a half-hour drive

04:41.781 --> 04:43.157
from where your mom and I
are gonna be living.

04:43.241 --> 04:46.661
- So, you want us to leave PCA?

04:46.744 --> 04:48.746

04:48.830 --> 04:50.039
I'm seeing someone.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.458
- Who?
- Katie Velasquez.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.048
Hi, Katie, I was wondering

04:59.132 --> 05:00.550
if maybe you wanted to catch

05:00.633 --> 05:02.176
a movie with me this weekend?

05:05.805 --> 05:08.099
[laughter]

05:08.182 --> 05:10.893
- Yeah.
I'm not sure she's into you.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.061
- And she never will be

05:12.145 --> 05:13.563
if I leave PCA.

05:13.646 --> 05:14.897
- Look, we don't want you guys

05:14.981 --> 05:16.232
to feel pressured to do this.

05:16.315 --> 05:17.900
- Just read the brochures,

05:17.984 --> 05:19.235
check out Covington prep online.

05:19.318 --> 05:21.237
- And let us know
what you want to do.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.749
- You're leaving PCA?

05:32.832 --> 05:34.083
- I didn't say that.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.753
- You're thinking
about leaving PCA?

05:36.836 --> 05:38.421
- Well, kind of, maybe.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.089
- Can I have your jet-x?

05:40.173 --> 05:41.466
- Obnoxious.
- Ow.

05:41.549 --> 05:44.427
Ow. Well,
if she's not gonna be here.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.553
- Doh!

05:46.929 --> 05:48.723
- Zoey, you can't be serious

05:48.806 --> 05:49.891
about this.

05:49.974 --> 05:50.808
- Look, I haven't decided.

05:50.892 --> 05:51.851
- How can you move to London,

05:51.934 --> 05:52.935
you love PCA.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.145
- Of course I do, I just--

05:54.228 --> 05:56.105
- She might love
Covington prep too.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.482
ZOEY: Yeah, I mean, it's--

05:57.565 --> 05:58.691

05:58.775 --> 06:00.026

06:00.109 --> 06:01.444
- I know.
I looked it up online.

06:01.527 --> 06:02.904
MICHAEL: Oh, online?

06:02.987 --> 06:04.447
You can't believe
everything you read online,

06:04.530 --> 06:06.157
'cause I read,
if you a drop a peanut

06:06.240 --> 06:08.951
in a glass of lemonade,
it explodes.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.495
Well, guess what.

06:10.578 --> 06:11.621
It didn't.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.415
Think about that.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.626
- Listen, it's not that
I want to leave PCA.

06:16.709 --> 06:17.919
- A, it's that
she's being offered

06:18.002 --> 06:19.420
this amazing opportunity.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.130
- Right, and that's why
I want to talk to you guys

06:21.214 --> 06:22.381
about this first.

06:22.465 --> 06:23.966
- What school
could possibly be better

06:24.050 --> 06:25.134
than PCA?

06:25.218 --> 06:26.844
- Covington's more expensive
than PCA.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.137
- The peanut just sank.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.430
- How many kids get a chance

06:29.514 --> 06:31.057
to go study in London?

06:31.140 --> 06:33.893
LOLA: Who cares?
- This isn't helping.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.021
- Well, what are you gonna do?

06:39.023 --> 06:40.191
- I'm gonna go ask Chase.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.652
- Chase doesn't know
about this yet?

06:42.735 --> 06:44.904
- No, and his opinion
means everything to me.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.572
- Well, why haven't
you asked him yet?

06:46.656 --> 06:47.740
- 'Cause, you know,

06:47.824 --> 06:49.951
we're really close friends,

06:50.034 --> 06:51.327
and it's just hard to tell him

06:51.410 --> 06:52.537
I might be leaving.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.372
- Yeah, but you
better go talk to him.

06:54.455 --> 06:56.541
- You're his best friend.

06:56.624 --> 06:57.792
- Excuse me?

06:57.875 --> 07:00.128
- His <i> female</i> best friend.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.212
- All right then.

07:01.295 --> 07:02.755
- What about me?

07:02.839 --> 07:04.549
- You're my female best friend.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.259
- You're diseased.

07:06.342 --> 07:07.593
- I got to talk to Chase.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.264
- Yeah.
And do whatever Chase says.

07:13.432 --> 07:15.351
- You know
he's gonna tell her to stay.

07:15.434 --> 07:16.602
- Exactly.

07:17.562 --> 07:20.356
- Maybe walnuts

07:20.439 --> 07:22.191
and pink lemonade.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.696
- Well, yeah,
a network anchorman

07:26.779 --> 07:28.531
probably pulls down
between three

07:28.614 --> 07:29.824
and five million a year.

07:29.907 --> 07:32.201
So by the time I'm 27,
I figure--

07:32.285 --> 07:34.370
- Hey, you want a story

07:34.453 --> 07:35.830
for the "PCA news?"

07:35.913 --> 07:37.206
- Okay, for the billionth time,

07:37.290 --> 07:38.374
I'm not doing a story

07:38.457 --> 07:39.792
about cotton swabs.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.043
- No.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.712
Zoey Brooks may be leaving PCA

07:42.795 --> 07:43.796
to go to a boarding school

07:43.880 --> 07:45.089
in London.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.425
- London?
Who's your source?

07:47.508 --> 07:49.010
- Zoey Brooks.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.221
And one day, you will do a story

07:52.305 --> 07:53.389
on cotton swabs

07:53.472 --> 07:54.432
because the public

07:54.515 --> 07:55.850
will demand it.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.145
- Wait, when is Zoey leaving?

07:59.228 --> 08:01.022
- Where's Zoey going?

08:01.105 --> 08:02.732
- She's leaving PCA.

08:02.815 --> 08:03.858
- To go where?

08:03.941 --> 08:04.901
- Some boarding school

08:04.984 --> 08:05.985
in London.

08:06.068 --> 08:07.069
- That's in England.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.708
- Hey, dude,
did you beat Norkin?

08:20.791 --> 08:21.959
- 6-1, 6-0.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.086
- Man, Norkin's the worst.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.338
- I know, right?

08:25.421 --> 08:27.465
- Oh, hey, when's Zoey leaving?

08:27.548 --> 08:28.674
- Leaving what?

08:28.758 --> 08:30.468
- I heard
she's bailing out of PCA

08:30.551 --> 08:32.094
to go to some fancy prep school

08:32.178 --> 08:33.971
in London.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.264
- Zoey Brooks?

08:35.347 --> 08:36.682
- That's what I heard.

08:36.765 --> 08:37.767
- Yeah, I don't think so.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.477
I think you got the wrong girl.

08:39.559 --> 08:40.852
- Maybe.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.438
- Later, man.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.110
Del Figgs.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.320
- Hey.

08:49.403 --> 08:52.365
Can you keep down the racket?

08:52.448 --> 08:53.533
- What?

08:53.616 --> 08:56.118
- Keep down the racket.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.870
I made a joke.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.121
- You sure?

08:59.205 --> 09:00.248
- No.

09:01.749 --> 09:04.252
So, what do you think
about Zoey?

09:04.335 --> 09:05.753
- What about her?

09:05.836 --> 09:07.630
- Leaving PCA?

09:07.713 --> 09:10.174
Moving to London?

09:10.258 --> 09:11.634
- Okay.

09:11.717 --> 09:12.969
Where did you hear this?

09:13.052 --> 09:14.804
- Everywhere.
I heard it from, like,

09:14.887 --> 09:16.138
three different people.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.894
Zoey didn't tell you?

09:21.978 --> 09:24.105
- No, she didn't.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.817

ZOEY: Chase.

09:32.488 --> 09:33.698
Chase, you in there?

09:42.623 --> 09:43.624
- Hiya.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.338
- Hey, you got a sec?

09:49.422 --> 09:50.339
- For you?

09:50.423 --> 09:51.799
Sure.

09:51.882 --> 09:53.509
- Good.
'Cause there's something

09:53.592 --> 09:54.635
I got to talk to you about.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.387
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

09:58.264 --> 09:59.932
- Is everything okay?

10:00.016 --> 10:01.517
- Everything's awesome.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.022
- Okay, see,

10:06.105 --> 10:07.148
my parents are moving to England

10:07.231 --> 10:09.692
for a while, and well,

10:09.775 --> 10:10.776
there's this boarding school

10:10.860 --> 10:13.195
near London called Covington.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.613
- Oh, Covington,
that's supposed

10:14.697 --> 10:17.616
to be a really amazing school.

10:17.700 --> 10:18.617
Wow, that's really cool

10:18.701 --> 10:21.370
that you get to go there.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.289
- Well, see,
I wanted to talk to you--

10:23.372 --> 10:24.874
- When are you leavin'?

10:26.208 --> 10:27.877
- Could you stop
throwing darts?

10:27.960 --> 10:28.961
- No, I got to tune up,

10:29.045 --> 10:31.297
but keep going, I'm listening.

10:31.380 --> 10:34.133
- Well, I just wanted
to talk to you about this.

10:34.216 --> 10:35.468
- Oh, well, you know,
you should probably

10:35.551 --> 10:36.886
get some warm clothes.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.013
The weather in England's
not like California.

10:39.096 --> 10:40.389
You should get a big coat.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.058
Oh, and some sweaters,

10:42.141 --> 10:44.518
maybe some heavy socks.

10:46.228 --> 10:49.023
- That's all you have to say?

10:49.106 --> 10:50.483
- Oh, yeah.
They drive on the left

10:50.566 --> 10:52.318
in England,
so be careful

10:52.401 --> 10:53.569
crossing the street.

10:55.905 --> 10:56.864
- Thanks.

10:56.947 --> 10:59.450
Appreciate the advice.

10:59.533 --> 11:00.576
- Anytime.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.143
<i>MICHAEL: Okay, everybody ready?</i>

11:26.227 --> 11:27.436
All right.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.771
You people
might want to step back,

11:28.854 --> 11:31.399
the blast
could be seriously dangerous.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.410
- Pass the salt.

11:43.452 --> 11:44.870
- Oh, man.

11:47.331 --> 11:50.292
- Oh, hey, Zo.
- No lunch?

11:50.376 --> 11:53.045
- They got
those little pot pies today.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.296
- I'm going.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.464
- Then you better hurry.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.467
The pot pies are really popular.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.927
- I mean, to London.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.264
I told my parents I'm gonna go.

12:05.808 --> 12:08.102
- You're leaving PCA?

12:10.479 --> 12:11.480
[boom]

12:22.950 --> 12:23.826
LOLA: Hurry.

12:23.909 --> 12:24.743
Come in, come in, come in.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.206
Okay, what are we gonna do?

12:29.290 --> 12:30.332
We can't let Zoey leave.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.876
- Wait, where's Chase?

12:31.959 --> 12:33.335
- He said he was busy.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.921
- Does he realize
Zoey's leaving PCA forever?

12:36.005 --> 12:37.673
- You're the one who told her
studying abroad

12:37.756 --> 12:38.966
could be awesome.

12:39.049 --> 12:39.592
- So, I'm not allowed
one stupid comment

12:39.675 --> 12:40.676
every five years.

12:40.759 --> 12:43.846
- And this is your fault too.
- How?

12:43.929 --> 12:45.514
- Why'd you have to tell Zoey
that Covington's one

12:45.598 --> 12:47.391
of the best boarding schools
in the world?

12:47.475 --> 12:48.517
- I don't want Zoey to leave.
- Oh, since when?

12:48.601 --> 12:51.437
- Zoey needs to stay at PCA,

12:51.520 --> 12:52.354
'cause the day is gonna come

12:52.438 --> 12:53.439
when she realizes

12:53.522 --> 12:54.607
she wants to make out with me.

12:54.690 --> 12:57.526
- Yeah,
when a piano falls on her head.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.402
- You're gonna want me
one day too.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.529
- Look, stop playing.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.989
We have to come up with a plan

13:02.072 --> 13:02.990
to talk Zoey out

13:03.073 --> 13:04.158
of going to London.

13:07.536 --> 13:10.873
- Michael,
what are you thinking?

13:10.956 --> 13:11.582
- I say we let Zoey do this.

13:11.665 --> 13:12.374
- Michael?
- What?

13:12.458 --> 13:13.459
- Dude?
- Come on.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.543
It couldn't have been easy

13:14.627 --> 13:17.296
for Zoey to decide to leave.

13:17.379 --> 13:18.422
I mean, we all know

13:18.506 --> 13:21.884
she loves PCA and us,

13:21.967 --> 13:23.052
but getting to go to school

13:23.135 --> 13:24.428
in England?

13:24.512 --> 13:27.223
That could be
a really cool thing for her.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.390
And what kind of friends are we

13:28.474 --> 13:29.558
if we make her feel bad
about this

13:29.642 --> 13:31.185
by trying to talk her out of it?

13:35.648 --> 13:40.194
- Man, I have a perfect nose.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.490
What?

13:55.709 --> 13:58.087
- Hey.
- What's up?

13:58.170 --> 13:59.755
- Where you been?

13:59.838 --> 14:00.297
- Here.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.716
Want to play?

14:02.800 --> 14:04.635
- Not really.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.016
You upset?

14:11.100 --> 14:12.059
- No, check it out,

14:12.142 --> 14:13.102
I'm on level 39.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.270
I'm dominating this game.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.854
- No, I mean, about Zoey.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.147
- Why,
'cause she's moving to England?

14:17.231 --> 14:19.316
- Yeah.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.359
You okay?

14:20.442 --> 14:23.362
- Should I be not okay?

14:23.445 --> 14:24.488
- Well,
she is one of your best friends

14:24.572 --> 14:26.448
in the world.

14:26.532 --> 14:27.741
- Hey, in third grade,

14:27.825 --> 14:28.617
Rusty Dickerson

14:28.701 --> 14:29.827
was my best friend in the world.

14:29.910 --> 14:30.744
- I never heard you

14:30.828 --> 14:31.912
talk about Rusty Dickerson.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.122
- That's the point, man.

14:33.205 --> 14:34.206
Friends come, friends go.

14:34.290 --> 14:37.543
You know,
that kid still owes me 30 cents?

14:39.295 --> 14:39.962
Dude.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.005
- What's your deal?

14:41.088 --> 14:42.798
- I was this close to level 40
and--

14:42.881 --> 14:46.844
- Zoey's leaving PCA for good

14:46.927 --> 14:49.138
and you're talking
about Dicky Rosenberg.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.389
- Rusty Dickerson.

14:50.472 --> 14:51.432
- How can you not care

14:51.515 --> 14:52.433
that Zoey's leaving?

14:52.516 --> 14:53.434
- Who says I don't care?

14:53.517 --> 14:54.476
- You don't act like it.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.394
- And since
when are you in charge

14:55.477 --> 14:57.771
of how I should act?

14:58.856 --> 15:00.983
- I'm just trying
to talk to you.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.526
- Well, let me know
when you want to talk

15:02.610 --> 15:03.986

here's the phone number
of my second cousin,

18:25.646 --> 18:28.607
Stephen Chapently.

18:28.690 --> 18:29.358
He lives right outside London,

18:29.441 --> 18:30.651
and he's super sweet,

18:30.734 --> 18:31.777
so give him a call

18:31.860 --> 18:33.695
if you're in the mood
to socialize.

18:33.779 --> 18:37.324
- Thanks, will do.

18:37.407 --> 18:40.035
- You're not gonna call him,

18:40.118 --> 18:41.370
are you?

18:41.453 --> 18:41.870
- No.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.206
- Oh, well,

18:44.289 --> 18:46.500
have a great time at Covington.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.418
I'll miss you.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.169
- I'll miss you too.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.259
- Hey.

18:55.342 --> 18:56.885
- You be nice to Quinn,

18:56.969 --> 18:58.720
and don't let her
blow up the school.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.806
- I'll do what I can.

19:08.272 --> 19:08.856
- I can't believe
I'm saying this,

19:08.939 --> 19:09.898
but I actually think

19:09.982 --> 19:12.651
I'm gonna miss you.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.528
- Last chance to make out.

19:14.611 --> 19:15.654
- You're a pig.

19:18.699 --> 19:19.950
- Take care of yourself.

19:28.125 --> 19:28.292
- Michael.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.254
- [sobbing]

19:32.337 --> 19:36.383
- Aw, Michael, don't cry.

19:36.466 --> 19:38.010

31:22.839 --> 31:24.048
to wait all day for him?

31:24.132 --> 31:25.049
- Do you guys want me

31:25.133 --> 31:26.384
on your team or not?

31:26.467 --> 31:27.802
- All right, come on.

31:27.885 --> 31:27.969
Let's see what you got.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.228
- Okay, Del Figgs,

31:37.312 --> 31:38.313
here's a high one
coming to you.

31:38.396 --> 31:40.898
- Yay, Mark, whack it good!

31:46.904 --> 31:48.114
- Oh!

31:48.197 --> 31:48.740
- Baby!

31:48.823 --> 31:51.075
Are you all right?

31:51.159 --> 31:52.869
- Oh.

31:52.952 --> 31:53.328
I don't like volleyball.

31:53.411 --> 31:55.538
- Oh.

31:59.709 --> 32:01.044
- You grab his feet.
- I'll get between his legs.

32:01.127 --> 32:02.378
- Take him to the bench.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.880
All right, let's do it.

32:06.549 --> 32:06.966
- Oh, God, you're heavy.

32:09.218 --> 32:10.261
- There we go.

32:11.262 --> 32:12.263
There.

32:12.347 --> 32:13.640
You rest.

32:14.974 --> 32:16.851
- I'm--I'm bleeding.

32:16.934 --> 32:17.018
- Nobody cares.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.523
- Look, we're gonna have

32:22.607 --> 32:24.233
to find a player to replace Zoey

32:24.317 --> 32:25.777
or else we should just drop out.

32:25.860 --> 32:26.861
- Hey.

32:29.614 --> 32:30.615
- You're late.
- Sorry.

32:30.698 --> 32:32.784
- Who's that with him?

32:35.453 --> 32:37.288
- It looks like Zoey.
- No way.

32:37.372 --> 32:39.207
- Sorry, I'm late.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.792
Guys, this is Gretchen.

32:40.875 --> 32:44.045
She's in my Monday,
Thursday study hall.

32:44.128 --> 32:45.380
- So?
- So, I thought

32:45.463 --> 32:46.756
maybe she could be
the new member

32:46.839 --> 32:48.257
of our volleyball team.

32:48.341 --> 32:50.301
- Are you good at volleyball?

32:50.385 --> 32:51.511
- I don't know.

32:56.432 --> 32:57.016
- Well, why don't

32:57.100 --> 32:58.726
we smack the ball around

32:58.810 --> 33:00.937
a little bit
and see how it goes.

33:01.020 --> 33:02.647
That cool with you?

33:02.730 --> 33:04.816
- Your hair is stupid.

33:06.317 --> 33:07.568
- Okay.

33:07.652 --> 33:08.319
- Woo, come on, let's go.

33:08.403 --> 33:09.987
- Let's settle this.

33:10.071 --> 33:14.075
- All right, people,
let's do this!

33:14.158 --> 33:15.326
Okay, heads up.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.755
- Hey, you got anything
for cramps?

33:27.839 --> 33:28.840
- Um...

33:31.426 --> 33:33.386
Not--not really.

33:34.345 --> 33:35.555
- So, let's try again.

33:44.814 --> 33:45.815
- Oh!

33:47.150 --> 33:48.192
- Baby!

33:48.276 --> 33:50.236
Oh.

33:50.319 --> 33:51.362
Are you all right?

33:54.198 --> 33:57.493
- You guys see
how high Gretchen hit that?

34:01.372 --> 34:02.123
- Are you okay?

34:04.876 --> 34:07.086
- I don't want to play
volleyball with Gretchen.

34:07.170 --> 34:08.337
- How icky is she?

34:08.420 --> 34:09.880
- Yeah,
what is Chase thinking?

34:09.964 --> 34:10.757
Why would he want to hang out
with a girl like that?

34:10.840 --> 34:13.967
- Oh, it's pretty obvious.

34:14.051 --> 34:15.303
- What?

34:15.386 --> 34:15.803
- She's blonde,

34:15.887 --> 34:16.804
insanely pretty.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.806
She looks like Zoey.

34:18.889 --> 34:22.601
- Well, yeah, but--oh, my God.

34:22.685 --> 34:24.437
You think that's why
he wants to be friends with her?

34:24.520 --> 34:25.980
- Totally.
I mean, come on,

34:26.063 --> 34:27.982
there's nothing appealing
about her personality.

34:28.065 --> 34:29.900
This is like psychology 101.

34:29.984 --> 34:32.277
He misses Zoey
so he's trying to fill that void

34:32.360 --> 34:32.987
with a substitute.

34:33.070 --> 34:35.156
- But that's so stupid.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.616
No one could replace Zoey.

34:40.870 --> 34:43.915
- [squealing]

34:46.833 --> 34:47.502
Surprise!

34:47.585 --> 34:50.004
[screams]

34:50.087 --> 34:51.672
Hi.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.132
- What are you doing
in our room?

34:53.216 --> 34:54.425
- I live here.

34:57.178 --> 34:59.055
No, seriously.

34:59.138 --> 35:01.182
- Okay, we're--
we're a little confused.

35:01.265 --> 35:02.683
- Or a lot.
- Well, see,

35:02.767 --> 35:04.352
I kind of overheard you guys
talking about

35:04.435 --> 35:05.478
how lonely it was gonna be

35:05.561 --> 35:06.103
for you living here without Zoey

35:06.187 --> 35:08.523
so I went to Coco

35:08.606 --> 35:10.024
and I asked her
if I could switch rooms

35:10.107 --> 35:11.859
and she said, "Sure,
who cares where you live?"

35:11.943 --> 35:13.194
- Yeah, but--
- So then I went to my

35:13.277 --> 35:15.196
roommates and I said,
"Would you girls be upset

35:15.279 --> 35:16.906
if I moved out of here
and in with Quinn and Lola?"

35:16.989 --> 35:18.324
and before
I even finished the question,

35:18.407 --> 35:19.992
they were helping me
pack my stuff.

35:23.621 --> 35:25.123
- You're gonna live here?

35:25.206 --> 35:27.166
- We're gonna be like
the Three Musketeers,

35:27.250 --> 35:30.044
but females.

35:30.127 --> 35:30.211
Oh!

35:33.840 --> 35:36.384

35:36.467 --> 35:37.885
and swabs for you.

35:40.763 --> 35:41.931

35:47.812 --> 35:49.897
- There he is.
What are you doing?

35:49.981 --> 35:50.898
- You were supposed
to meet us at Sushi Rocks.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.150
- I am, but I invited Gretchen

35:53.234 --> 35:54.527
and she's a little late.

35:54.610 --> 35:56.279
- Oh, why'd you
invite Gretchen?

35:56.362 --> 35:57.738
- 'Cause she's my bud.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.574
I'll go see
if I can find her in the hall.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.161
- What's wrong with him?

36:04.245 --> 36:05.204
Why can't he see

36:05.288 --> 36:06.873
that Gretchen's disgusting?

36:06.956 --> 36:08.332
- 'Cause she looks like Zoey.

36:08.416 --> 36:10.126
- Then Chase
needs a psychiatrist.

36:10.209 --> 36:11.294
- Oh, give the boy a break.

36:11.377 --> 36:12.712
- Dude,

36:12.795 --> 36:14.255
trying to replace a girl
with another girl

36:14.338 --> 36:15.381
just 'cause they look alike,

36:15.464 --> 36:16.716
that's a little sick.

36:16.799 --> 36:18.175
- So?
You're sick too.

36:18.259 --> 36:19.093
- I'm not sick.

36:19.176 --> 36:20.303
- Then why do you take at least

36:20.386 --> 36:21.596
100 digital pictures

36:21.679 --> 36:22.930
of yourself every week?

36:23.014 --> 36:23.556
- 'Cause I have
movie star good looks.

36:23.639 --> 36:25.850
- See that?

36:25.933 --> 36:26.225
You're sicker than I thought.

36:29.854 --> 36:31.772
- I didn't see Gretchen.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.190
Maybe I can get her on her cell.

36:33.274 --> 36:34.483
- I'll cross my fingers.

36:38.946 --> 36:41.949
- Oh, here she is.

36:42.033 --> 36:42.950
Hey, Gretch.

36:43.034 --> 36:43.784
- Hi.

36:43.868 --> 36:46.621
- So, Sushi Rocks?

36:46.704 --> 36:47.580
- I don't care.

36:47.663 --> 36:48.414
CHASE: Awesome.
Oh.

36:48.497 --> 36:49.665
Hey, you know how you told me

36:49.749 --> 36:51.959
you locked yourself
out of your room last night?

36:52.043 --> 36:53.252
- I guess.

36:53.336 --> 36:55.546
- Well, I got you somethin'.

36:56.923 --> 37:00.134
Give me your room key.

37:00.217 --> 37:00.968
All right.
