WEBVTT

01:12.073 --> 01:14.280
(coughing)

01:22.708 --> 01:25.871
Henry, I need you to calm down.

01:26.045 --> 01:28.081
We're trying to help.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.262
No--!

01:46.607 --> 01:49.314
(air bag hissing)

01:57.243 --> 01:59.404
(coughing)

02:01.122 --> 02:04.614
Drink some of that.
Both of you.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.248
(coughing)

02:11.590 --> 02:14.502
Some council meeting, huh?

02:14.677 --> 02:16.793
We're two members short.

02:16.971 --> 02:20.509
Hershel: I think we should make some
new rules before they get back.

02:20.683 --> 02:24.141
I hereby declare we have
spaghetti Tuesdays

02:24.312 --> 02:26.268
every Wednesday.

02:29.358 --> 02:32.145
First we have to find
some spaghetti.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.031
You okay to take over?

02:47.668 --> 02:51.035
Every five to six seconds, squeeze.

02:51.213 --> 02:53.465
You start feeling lightheaded,

02:53.632 --> 02:56.669
grab somebody else to take over.

02:57.803 --> 03:00.010
We'll take it in shifts.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.505
You want to help me
go on my rounds?

03:03.684 --> 03:05.925
Yeah.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.889
Sure.

03:14.487 --> 03:16.899
How long will that keep him alive?

03:19.867 --> 03:22.859
Justaslong
as we're willing to do it.

03:24.038 --> 03:26.404
As long as it takes.

03:29.085 --> 03:31.041
(coughing)

03:33.506 --> 03:35.087
( hisses )

03:37.176 --> 03:39.337
(scattered coughing )

04:00.658 --> 04:03.149
( whispers )
No. Not here.

04:15.047 --> 04:17.038
Help me get him on this.

04:17.216 --> 04:20.583
Okay, but in a couple
of hours when Henry's dead--

04:20.761 --> 04:22.843
- Glenn.
- How are we gonna get his body

04:23.013 --> 04:25.595
down the stairs,
across the cell block

04:25.766 --> 04:27.427
and through those doors
without anyone noticing?

04:27.601 --> 04:31.344
If that happens-- if--
you're gonna help me.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.437
And what if I'm gone?

04:34.608 --> 04:37.441
Shut up and help me
get him on this.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.235
What are you doing?

04:50.624 --> 04:54.367
We're taking Mr. Jacobson
to a quieter place.

04:57.965 --> 05:01.833
Go get my copy of "Tom Sawyer"
from my room.

05:02.011 --> 05:04.377
I want you to read it by tonight.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.887
- We all gotjobs to do.
-(coughs)

05:07.057 --> 05:09.548
- That one's yours.
- I won't finish it.

05:12.313 --> 05:13.974
Why?

05:14.148 --> 05:15.638
It's gonna get too dark.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.807
Well,

05:17.985 --> 05:20.101
give it your best try.

05:20.279 --> 05:22.736
- ( coughing)
- And drink some tea.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.792
You haven't had to do this yet,
have you?

05:42.843 --> 05:46.085
There was one late last night.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.174
Sasha did it.

05:48.349 --> 05:51.466
People don't need to see it.

05:51.644 --> 05:53.635
I don't want them to.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.354
(grunting)

06:07.034 --> 06:10.276
(theme music playing )

06:44.029 --> 06:44.063
( door opens)

06:44.071 --> 06:45.231
( door opens)

06:56.125 --> 06:59.208
Where's Glenn?
He said he would meet me.

06:59.378 --> 07:02.370
He's resting.

07:02.548 --> 07:03.879
Is he okay?

07:04.049 --> 07:07.382
He was helping me
and he got tired, that's all.

07:07.553 --> 07:09.919
- If you need help, I can help you.
- I don't.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.634
lwasjust keeping him occupied.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.890
Keeping his mind
on helping people.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.800
I can come in there
and help you.

07:16.979 --> 07:18.264
No, you don't need to.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.430
- You can rest--
- No!

07:34.913 --> 07:36.949
How's Bethy?

07:37.958 --> 07:40.290
She's okay.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.497
Daddy, you look so tired.

07:42.671 --> 07:45.458
I am.
( chuckles)

07:45.633 --> 07:47.123
But I'm fine.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.963
They could return any minute now.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.717
It's hard in here.

07:53.891 --> 07:56.257
But we're holding it together.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.472
We're gonna make it.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.768
Don't you believe that?

08:08.781 --> 08:11.488
Of course.

08:11.659 --> 08:14.947
Just hold it together a little longer.

08:16.538 --> 08:17.869
Please?

08:20.292 --> 08:22.499
I love you, honey.

08:24.505 --> 08:27.247
I love you, too.

08:45.651 --> 08:48.017
Thank you for stopping her.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.437
We need someone out there
taking care of things.

08:53.242 --> 08:55.483
If she saw me,

08:55.661 --> 08:58.152
couldn't keep her out.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.707
I know you didn't want to lie to her.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.080
I wasn't lying.

09:02.251 --> 09:03.707
Look at you.
You're resting.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.162
( chuckles )

09:05.337 --> 09:07.419
I'm almost done down here.

09:07.589 --> 09:10.251
Why don't you go lie down?

09:17.516 --> 09:19.757
(growling)

09:35.200 --> 09:37.316
( gate creaks )

09:50.799 --> 09:53.962
Carl, Judith, are they okay?

09:54.136 --> 09:55.421
Yeah. Where's Carol?

09:55.596 --> 09:58.258
Glenn, Hershel, Sasha?

09:58.432 --> 10:00.764
Yeah, it's bad, but they're fighting it.
Daryl's not back yet.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.721
Rick.
Rick, where's Carol?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.317
It was her.

10:12.488 --> 10:15.104
She killed Karen and David.

10:19.161 --> 10:21.948
She was trying to stop it
from spreading.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.659
Tyreese is gonna
be back here soon,

10:24.833 --> 10:26.448
so I didn't think she should be here.

10:27.961 --> 10:31.078
And I couldn't have her here.

10:31.256 --> 10:34.089
She has a car, supplies,

10:34.259 --> 10:35.965
she'll figure it out.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.094
I'll tell your dad.
Don't tell anyone else yet.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.380
Okay.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.725
Would you have brought her back?

10:50.567 --> 10:53.730
- She said she did it?
- Yeah.

10:57.699 --> 11:00.941
Then you were right
to send her away.

11:01.119 --> 11:02.325
I don't know if I could have.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.908
You could have, Maggie.

11:05.082 --> 11:07.164
You've done harder things.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.826
Don't doubt yourself.
We don't get to anymore.

11:12.756 --> 11:14.997
Rick, the cluster's getting bigger
than the one that took the fence down.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.167
- We need to do something.
- We will.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.845
Carl?

11:23.350 --> 11:25.011
Carl.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.602
Carl?

11:28.772 --> 11:30.478
You okay?

11:30.649 --> 11:32.856
l was gonna ask you that.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.108
- We're fine.
- No one's sick?

11:35.279 --> 11:36.644
You didn't have to do anything?

11:36.822 --> 11:39.609
Haven't had to use my gun, Dad.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.865
And Judith?

11:42.035 --> 11:43.491
She's with Beth.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.198
Good.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.034
Found some food on the run.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.369
There's a bunch
of fruit leather in there.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.535
Have everybody brush
their teeth after.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.373
- Can we come out soon?
- Not just yet.

11:57.551 --> 12:01.043
Dad, I was around you
when you were in the middle of it.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.463
And lwas around Patrick.

12:04.641 --> 12:07.178
I didn't get it.
I can help you.

12:07.352 --> 12:10.719
Thanks, but I need you to stay here.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.889
|wi||.

12:13.066 --> 12:17.730
But, Dad, you can't keep me from it.

12:18.739 --> 12:21.902
From what?

12:22.075 --> 12:23.906
From what always happens.

12:25.662 --> 12:29.371
Yeah. Maybe.

12:29.541 --> 12:31.827
But I think it's my job to try.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.577
( door closes)

12:47.768 --> 12:49.224
Thank you.

12:51.355 --> 12:53.095
No problem.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.444
( raspy breathing )

13:06.536 --> 13:08.618
Let's have a look at you.

13:16.588 --> 13:19.045
Doctors make the worst patients.

13:20.050 --> 13:23.292
Not everyone gets to live.

13:25.639 --> 13:28.221
( sniffles )
End stage

13:28.392 --> 13:30.599
is a point that no one
comes back from

13:30.769 --> 13:33.636
or they--
or they can't.

13:34.648 --> 13:37.310
That's where I am.

13:37.484 --> 13:41.648
No, you need to focus on
the ones that can make it.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.572
I made some more IVs.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.822
If you're not ready to lose one,

13:49.997 --> 13:51.282
you're gonna lose them all.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.287
It's like turning off a light--

13:53.458 --> 13:55.915
it'll happen one after the other.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.626
And they don'tjust die.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.004
We can hold on.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.340
Caleb.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.342
Caleb.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.095
After what happened
in the other cell block,

14:09.266 --> 14:12.008
when I came in here,
I brought these.

14:12.185 --> 14:15.177
Get back in bed now.
We're not that bad off.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.269
When we are,

14:20.444 --> 14:22.685
it'll be too late.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.104
You don't understand.

14:25.282 --> 14:27.773
You have a chance.

14:27.951 --> 14:29.487
This is it after this.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.697
I'm not giving up on anyone.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.954
Not yet.

14:34.124 --> 14:37.537
Just make sure everyone's
doors are shut.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.962
Caleb...

14:44.634 --> 14:46.716
Just make sure!

14:46.887 --> 14:49.219
(coughing)

14:52.142 --> 14:54.804
Caleb, you've got
to let me look at you.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.608
Okay, Hershel.

15:00.776 --> 15:03.188
Have a look.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.321
Drink the tea I left you.

15:12.496 --> 15:15.329
Gonna be back to check
on you in an hour.

15:15.499 --> 15:17.956
(coughing, gagging)

15:28.887 --> 15:32.050
(gurgling)

15:32.224 --> 15:33.634
(gurgling stops)

15:48.573 --> 15:51.064
(distant coughing)

15:58.500 --> 16:01.116
Everyone,

16:01.294 --> 16:03.546
get back in your cells.

16:08.218 --> 16:11.506
Go on, get back in your cells.

16:17.602 --> 16:18.887
Let's get him on this.

16:37.581 --> 16:39.742
(grunting)

16:39.916 --> 16:42.532
( panting )

16:45.005 --> 16:46.870
Go rest.

16:47.048 --> 16:49.039
Can you make it to your cell?

17:00.812 --> 17:05.351
J‘ Go your way J‘

17:07.402 --> 17:10.644
J‘ I'll take the long way around J‘

17:10.822 --> 17:14.360
J‘ I'll find my own way down J‘

17:14.534 --> 17:17.697
J‘ As I should J‘

17:23.210 --> 17:28.375
J‘ And hold your gaze J‘

17:30.008 --> 17:33.375
J‘ There's coke in the Midas touch J‘

17:33.553 --> 17:37.387
J‘ Ajoke in the way that we rust J‘

17:37.557 --> 17:40.390
J‘ And breathe again... J‘

17:40.560 --> 17:41.720
( crunches )

17:44.064 --> 17:46.396
Rick:
Hershel.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.443
Third one we've lost.

17:55.617 --> 17:57.983
We're burning them
behind the blocks.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.618
Burning them.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.375
That's what it's come to.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.789
Are you okay?

18:10.340 --> 18:13.252
I talked to him yesterday
about Steinbeck.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.758
He told me a quote.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.511
"A sad soul

18:18.682 --> 18:22.049
can kill quicker
than a germ."

18:23.853 --> 18:27.766
That's exactly why I didn't want
them all to see what happens.

18:29.192 --> 18:32.059
I know they know,

18:32.237 --> 18:35.570
but I didn't want them
to see it right now.

18:36.574 --> 18:39.316
They're seeing you, Hershel.

18:41.454 --> 18:45.367
They see you keep going.

18:45.542 --> 18:48.705
Even after all the choices
keep getting taken away.

18:56.219 --> 18:59.302
When we get past this thing...

19:00.557 --> 19:03.299
it's not gonna be like
how it was, is it?

19:03.476 --> 19:05.967
No.

19:09.607 --> 19:12.974
Was that denial?

19:13.153 --> 19:15.064
Not seeing things for how they were?

19:15.238 --> 19:16.819
No.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.072
You just caught a break.

19:19.242 --> 19:22.734
You needed some time.
You got some.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.823
You got lucky.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.239
We all did.

19:27.417 --> 19:30.784
I still think there's a plan.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.212
I still believe there's a reason.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.300
You think it's all a test?

19:40.805 --> 19:43.296
Life was always a test, Rick.

19:49.022 --> 19:51.479
I need to talk to you about Carol.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.744
( rattles )

20:15.423 --> 20:17.539
( rattles )

20:33.233 --> 20:35.144
Come on.

20:35.318 --> 20:37.479
Come on, Sasha.

20:39.531 --> 20:41.396
You know how to fight.

20:42.784 --> 20:44.900
Just hold on.

20:48.998 --> 20:52.490
Just hold on.
Don't give up on me, now.

20:59.467 --> 20:59.501
(growling)

20:59.509 --> 21:01.124
(growling)

21:11.062 --> 21:12.802
| just talked to your dad.

21:12.981 --> 21:16.348
He looks good,
all things considered.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.359
If Carl were sick,
would you be up there with him?

21:21.698 --> 21:24.280
If I thought I could help.

21:24.451 --> 21:26.237
You don't think I can help?

21:30.748 --> 21:31.737
(yelpsl

21:32.750 --> 21:34.206
- ( grunts)
- Damn.

21:39.424 --> 21:41.255
I'm just glad you're out here with me.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.975
Welcome back.

21:59.444 --> 22:01.400
I passed out?

22:01.571 --> 22:05.439
You were dehydrated.
Being a hero takes a lot out of you.

22:06.618 --> 22:08.654
You should know.

22:11.414 --> 22:14.656
I thought you were an idiot
to come in here.

22:14.834 --> 22:19.669
I mean, I was sure you were just gonna
be a dead foolish man.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.421
I can't tell
if that's a compliment.

22:25.178 --> 22:28.295
I must have hit my head.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.515
I don't believe in magic

22:36.689 --> 22:38.850
or luck.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.192
I do the math

22:43.363 --> 22:45.854
and I don't gamble.

22:47.951 --> 22:50.863
But I don't know
if I'd be here right now

22:51.037 --> 22:53.699
if you weren't
so damn stupid.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.034
You know what?

22:56.209 --> 22:59.121
I'm gonna take that
as a compliment.

23:04.634 --> 23:07.296
(hissing)

23:29.576 --> 23:31.692
(air hissing)

23:42.672 --> 23:44.583
Hersh--
(coughs)

23:44.757 --> 23:47.999
Hershel--
( coughing )

23:50.096 --> 23:52.587
( retching )

23:58.605 --> 24:00.596
( rattling )

24:00.773 --> 24:03.310
I'll check on you in a little while.

24:07.447 --> 24:08.937
How is he?

24:09.115 --> 24:10.696
He's sleeping.

24:10.867 --> 24:13.358
You should get
some rest yourself.

24:13.536 --> 24:17.279
I don't want to leave him
in case he wakes up.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.289
( rattling )

24:20.460 --> 24:22.701
- Want me to take a look at him?
- No.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.631
Just let him sleep.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.460
( wheezing )

24:31.429 --> 24:34.011
- ( growling )
- Hershel!

24:34.182 --> 24:35.797
Hershel!

24:35.975 --> 24:38.591
(growling)

24:42.857 --> 24:45.690
Everyone stay in your cells.

24:50.239 --> 24:51.775
No.

24:51.949 --> 24:53.485
( crunches )

24:56.788 --> 24:58.153
(woman screams )

24:58.331 --> 25:00.663
- ( screams )
- ( gunshot echoes)

25:04.921 --> 25:06.707
Go.

25:06.881 --> 25:09.042
The fence is more important.
We need to keep it standing.

25:09.217 --> 25:11.333
I got this.

25:13.221 --> 25:16.509
- You can't do this alone.
- I know. Go.

25:25.983 --> 25:28.725
- ( gunshot)
- ( screaming )

25:34.784 --> 25:36.695
Lizzie:
Just follow me, Henry.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.827
Down here, away from Glenn.
Come on.

25:41.541 --> 25:43.452
Come on, Henry.
Here we go. This way.

25:43.626 --> 25:45.457
(growling)

25:48.965 --> 25:51.001
(snarling )

25:56.806 --> 26:00.424
Come on, boy.
Come on, Henry.

26:00.601 --> 26:03.138
Just a little more.

26:03.312 --> 26:04.848
Keep coming.

26:05.022 --> 26:07.058
Come on, boy.
Let's go. Come on.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.938
Carl?

26:20.121 --> 26:21.827
( softly )
Carl...?

26:22.832 --> 26:24.823
Carl.

26:25.001 --> 26:26.616
I heard gunshots.

26:26.794 --> 26:28.580
I need your help.

26:31.591 --> 26:34.082
Lizzie:
Come on. Down here, Henry.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.251
Keep following me.
Come here.

26:36.429 --> 26:39.262
A little further.

26:39.432 --> 26:41.468
Henry, come on--
( gasps )

26:41.642 --> 26:44.384
(screaming )

26:54.447 --> 26:56.563
- You okay?
- I called him nice.

26:56.741 --> 26:59.403
He didn't scratch Glenn.
I thought maybe he listens.

26:59.577 --> 27:01.989
- Lizzie, where is Glenn?
- His cell.

27:02.997 --> 27:05.283
( panting )

27:06.584 --> 27:08.040
Dad!

27:08.211 --> 27:10.623
Dad! Open the door!

27:13.466 --> 27:15.002
(thumps)

27:17.553 --> 27:19.134
( clanks )

27:21.015 --> 27:22.380
( screams )

27:22.558 --> 27:24.719
Get back in there.

27:26.020 --> 27:28.511
You two stay put in here.

27:29.524 --> 27:30.513
( rattles )

27:30.691 --> 27:32.818
(gasping, wheezing )

27:37.990 --> 27:41.027
Hold on, Glenn.
Hold on.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.151
(snaps)

27:46.123 --> 27:47.659
(woman whimpers)
Hershel!

27:55.466 --> 27:57.878
(snarling )

27:58.052 --> 27:59.963
Caleb.
Caleb, we need the gun.

28:00.137 --> 28:02.514
(growling)

28:05.184 --> 28:06.720
( cracks )

28:12.900 --> 28:13.935
( rattles )

28:14.110 --> 28:16.692
Think they're okay?

28:16.863 --> 28:18.854
If things were going bad,
we would have heard more shots.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.646
Maggie would have gotten us.

28:20.825 --> 28:22.565
We have to do this.

28:22.743 --> 28:24.574
Let's do it.

28:26.455 --> 28:29.538
- I got it.
- Let me help.

28:34.714 --> 28:36.796
All right, set it down.
All right.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.337
(fence rattling )

28:40.511 --> 28:43.173
( creaking )

28:48.436 --> 28:50.552
Run!

28:58.738 --> 29:01.571
Dad, come on!
Come on!

29:12.752 --> 29:15.209
(growling, snarling)

29:26.390 --> 29:27.641
(walkers growling,
snarling )

29:27.808 --> 29:29.719
Dad, what do we do?

29:29.894 --> 29:32.260
Maybe I could back the bus up
against the fence.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.019
Will it hold?

29:35.900 --> 29:38.767
(fence rattling )

29:40.655 --> 29:42.486
Come on.

29:46.243 --> 29:48.859
(growling)

30:00.675 --> 30:02.836
Pockets.

30:04.303 --> 30:05.679
Here.

30:05.846 --> 30:07.131
- Got it?
- Yep.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.592
(fence creaking )

30:18.359 --> 30:19.769
- All right, listen to me.
- Carl: All right.

30:19.944 --> 30:22.731
Magazine goes in here.
Release is here.

30:22.905 --> 30:24.520
Make sure it latches.

30:26.075 --> 30:27.940
Pull back the operating rod

30:28.119 --> 30:29.780
- and rounds feed up.
- ( clicks)

30:29.954 --> 30:32.696
Keep squeezing the trigger
for rapid fire, okay?

30:32.873 --> 30:34.864
You shoot or you run.

30:35.042 --> 30:37.158
Don't let 'em get close, okay?

30:38.170 --> 30:39.706
( rattling )

30:51.100 --> 30:53.341
( gunfire rattles )

31:08.492 --> 31:10.073
( clicks )

31:16.083 --> 31:18.916
-(snaﬂs)
- ( tapping )

31:26.802 --> 31:29.134
(gunfire continues)

31:34.977 --> 31:37.013
Back off!

31:46.030 --> 31:47.941
(pop5)

31:53.662 --> 31:55.448
( gunfire rattles )

31:56.707 --> 31:58.823
( panting )

32:04.298 --> 32:06.289
( crashing )

32:07.426 --> 32:09.587
(snarling )

32:11.388 --> 32:14.004
(shotgun clicks)

32:14.183 --> 32:17.095
( gunshot blasts)

32:17.269 --> 32:18.805
(shotgun clicks)

32:18.979 --> 32:20.844
( blasts )

32:21.023 --> 32:22.388
(shotgun clicks)

32:27.988 --> 32:31.446
(gasping )

32:31.617 --> 32:32.606
( Hershel slapping )

32:32.785 --> 32:34.525
Hold on, Glenn.

32:34.703 --> 32:37.991
- We have something.
- ( Glenn wheezing )

32:38.165 --> 32:39.826
We still have it.

32:46.674 --> 32:48.380
Son of a bitch.

32:54.098 --> 32:56.464
- ( snarling)
- ( gunshot)

32:56.642 --> 32:58.303
Daddy!

32:58.477 --> 33:00.559
( Henry snarling )

33:01.564 --> 33:02.974
( groans )

33:05.359 --> 33:08.692
No! You could hit the bag.
We need it for Glenn.

33:15.452 --> 33:17.659
(gunshot)

33:20.416 --> 33:24.125
- Where is he?
- He's up here. Cell 100.

33:28.132 --> 33:30.464
(Glenn gasping)

33:30.634 --> 33:32.590
He's turning blue!

33:32.761 --> 33:35.377
Clear his airway.
I'm on the way.

33:39.435 --> 33:41.471
- Dad.
- Roll him on his back.

33:41.645 --> 33:43.601
(gasping )

33:45.232 --> 33:48.565
- Dad.
- ( gurgling)

33:48.736 --> 33:51.819
Hold his arms down.

33:58.162 --> 33:59.368
Come on, son.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.278
Come on.
You know how this works.

34:01.457 --> 34:02.446
Easy.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.367
Just relax.

34:08.714 --> 34:11.080
Stay with us.

34:13.302 --> 34:15.964
Stay with us...

34:16.138 --> 34:18.720
stay with us.

34:18.891 --> 34:21.098
(gasping stops)

34:26.774 --> 34:28.765
You're gonna be okay.

34:28.943 --> 34:31.400
We're gonna be okay.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.693
I didn't want you in here.

34:42.665 --> 34:44.781
I know.

34:44.959 --> 34:47.416
I had to.

34:49.129 --> 34:50.505
Just like you.

34:56.845 --> 34:58.972
Daddy.

35:09.525 --> 35:11.686
I told you to stay put.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.983
Is it over?

35:19.535 --> 35:21.571
I hope so, honey.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.550
(growling)

35:44.143 --> 35:45.633
(growling)

35:45.811 --> 35:47.267
(growling stops)

35:48.272 --> 35:50.888
(faint snarling )

35:57.740 --> 36:00.026
(faint snarling )

36:06.999 --> 36:09.741
( panting )

36:14.089 --> 36:16.250
(car approaching )

36:19.136 --> 36:20.797
Dad...

36:20.971 --> 36:23.508
everything's gonna be okay.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.601
( gate creaks )

36:39.990 --> 36:41.651
( screeches, rattling )

36:47.664 --> 36:50.576
- Sasha? How's Sasha?
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

36:50.751 --> 36:52.116
Daryl:
Get in there. We got this.

36:57.549 --> 37:00.336
( wheezing )

37:20.614 --> 37:22.775
(footsteps clanging )

37:47.349 --> 37:49.590
Dad...?

37:50.978 --> 37:52.889
They're back now.
Go rest.

38:02.406 --> 38:04.863
(music playing )

38:17.129 --> 38:21.919
J‘ Go your way J‘

38:23.385 --> 38:26.969
J‘ I'll take the long way around J‘

38:27.139 --> 38:30.631
J‘ I'll find my own way down J‘

38:30.809 --> 38:33.676
J‘ As I should J‘

38:35.898 --> 38:40.858
J‘ And hold your gaze J‘

38:42.321 --> 38:45.484
J‘ There's coke in the Midas touch J‘

38:45.657 --> 38:49.491
J‘ Ajoke in the way that we rust J‘

38:49.661 --> 38:51.913
J‘ And breathe again J‘

38:58.086 --> 39:00.623
J‘ And you'll find loss J‘

39:00.797 --> 39:04.381
J‘ And you'll fear what you found J‘

39:05.636 --> 39:08.002
J‘ When weather comes J‘

39:08.180 --> 39:10.341
J‘ Tearing down... J‘

39:15.896 --> 39:18.558
(sobbing )

39:30.327 --> 39:32.568
( rumbles, bangs)

39:53.642 --> 39:55.553
Need some help with that?

39:55.727 --> 39:58.969
No. Do your thing.

40:09.157 --> 40:10.863
Hey.

40:11.034 --> 40:13.070
You didn't wake me up.

40:13.245 --> 40:15.531
I thought I'd let you sleep in.

40:15.706 --> 40:18.368
- I should help.
- Good.

40:18.542 --> 40:20.078
I've got to go talk to Daryl.

40:20.252 --> 40:22.743
Right now?

40:22.921 --> 40:24.707
No.

40:24.881 --> 40:26.917
Soon.Soon.

40:37.519 --> 40:40.261
- How's Glenn doing?
- He made it through the night.

40:40.439 --> 40:41.804
He's breathing on his own now.

40:41.982 --> 40:44.223
Maggie and Bob are with him.

40:44.401 --> 40:47.188
He seems stable enough
for me to get some air.

40:47.362 --> 40:50.229
- He's a tough son of a bitch.
- He is.

40:50.407 --> 40:52.989
You're a tough
son of a bitch.

40:53.160 --> 40:56.243
- I am.
- How about Carol?

40:56.413 --> 40:58.278
She up in A block with Lizzie?

40:58.457 --> 41:01.119
No. Talk to Rick about her.

41:01.293 --> 41:04.456
She's okay, just talk to him.

41:13.597 --> 41:15.303
You heading out?

41:15.474 --> 41:16.759
You want to come?

41:17.768 --> 41:19.633
Hell, yeah.

41:29.112 --> 41:30.818
(engine starts)

42:22.999 --> 42:25.251
(theme music playing )
