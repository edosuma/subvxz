Previously, on VGHS (subtitles by MisterMascolo)

00:03.419 --> 00:05.575
Jenny, make Varsity?

00:05.575 --> 00:07.715
Not on my watch

00:12.380 --> 00:13.837
You signed me up for drift racing

00:13.837 --> 00:14.750
Ted, I'm sorry

00:14.750 --> 00:17.002
I'm splitz-fied baby

00:17.002 --> 00:19.889
we're through

00:19.889 --> 00:21.972
you're expelled

00:21.972 --> 00:24.368
pack up your dreams and go

00:24.368 --> 00:26.062
Sorry, ki

00:26.062 --> 00:29.140
Ted stays where he belongs

00:29.140 --> 00:30.424
in my shadow!

00:30.424 --> 00:31.828
What're you doing Brian

00:31.828 --> 00:33.944
Why did you throw it on the way

00:33.944 --> 00:35.708
Because you're too good for him Jenny

00:35.708 --> 00:37.875
and because I'm in love with you

01:30.679 --> 01:32.717
Thanks Mr. D

01:43.363 --> 01:46.120
Another busy night Mr. D

01:46.120 --> 01:49.571
It's always a busy night

01:49.571 --> 01:51.663
knock yourself up

01:52.885 --> 01:55.571
Is... Is that Brian D?

01:55.571 --> 01:57.371
See if he will play a game with us

01:57.371 --> 02:02.572
I'm sorry, Brian never games with the customers

02:08.836 --> 02:11.478
Come on, scram scrow

02:17.365 --> 02:21.621
Go back to VGHS, Jumper Jax

02:21.621 --> 02:25.230
Whatever, quitter

02:25.230 --> 02:28.220
yeah, i'll go

02:35.650 --> 02:37.861
Always looking out for a little guy

02:37.861 --> 02:40.768
Ted?

02:40.768 --> 02:42.135
How long has it been?

02:42.135 --> 02:44.407
Twentyfour hours?

02:44.407 --> 02:46.856
You have it D., it's a day!

02:46.856 --> 02:48.392
Come on let's go get a slice

02:48.392 --> 02:50.345
alright!

02:52.404 --> 02:54.631
And then Calhoun told me i can't switch to rythm gaming

02:54.631 --> 02:58.010
cause once you've signed up you're locked in the system

02:58.376 --> 03:00.299
It goes a butt

03:00.412 --> 03:01.907
Same old story

03:01.907 --> 03:03.748
calhoun always wins

03:03.748 --> 03:06.775
but it's a story with a twist ending

03:06.775 --> 03:11.659
you signed up, you're still in the system, you can totally try out tomorrow

03:12.489 --> 03:15.301
It's taking worse when you're expelled

03:15.301 --> 03:17.244
And even if i did, tomorrow is not good for me

03:17.244 --> 03:19.239
We've got this huge birthday party coming

03:19.239 --> 03:22.016
dude, come on

03:22.016 --> 03:24.575
As much as i love what you've done to the place

03:24.575 --> 03:27.694
it ain't VGHS

03:27.694 --> 03:29.877
Uhm.. That's kind of the idea

03:29.877 --> 03:33.543
You actually play games for fun here

03:33.543 --> 03:36.629
Tell me we didn't have fun together?

03:36.629 --> 03:39.804
We had some swell times

03:39.983 --> 03:42.810
to better days

03:55.956 --> 03:58.061
So...

03:58.061 --> 04:00.243
How are you Ted

04:00.243 --> 04:03.250
i was really sad to hear about you and ki

04:04.680 --> 04:06.645
never say to me that name again

04:06.645 --> 04:10.879
what name?

04:10.879 --> 04:12.732
my name?

04:12.732 --> 04:14.181
Ki

04:14.181 --> 04:15.311
Ki!

04:15.311 --> 04:16.795
What a surprise!

04:16.795 --> 04:18.707
Oh yes, hello

04:18.707 --> 04:21.445
here

04:23.494 --> 04:25.234
Will you stop being mad at me now?

04:25.234 --> 04:28.683
Brian tell Ki that fixing my guitar doesn't make up for breaking my hopes and dreams

04:28.683 --> 04:31.797
Ted, tell Brian that you were being a big stupid dumb jerk

04:31.797 --> 04:33.887
Brian, Ki says i'm a big stupid

04:34.994 --> 04:38.795
dammit

04:43.177 --> 04:44.933
So, ki

04:44.933 --> 04:46.098
it's been a while

04:46.098 --> 04:47.150
it's been one day Brian

04:47.150 --> 04:49.359
Ah ok

04:53.805 --> 04:54.612
Hey you

04:54.612 --> 04:55.512
loser

04:55.512 --> 04:57.129
can't hail the rock?

04:57.129 --> 04:58.756
than you'd better whack

04:58.756 --> 05:00.898
away

05:00.898 --> 05:02.450
Remember, while you still do drugs

05:02.450 --> 05:07.934
you're a loser, so why you don't stop playing and go taking some drugs, loser?

05:10.043 --> 05:12.814
Whoa, you suck

05:31.289 --> 05:33.609
why is Ted so stupid

05:35.132 --> 05:36.566
Ted isn't...

05:36.566 --> 05:42.638
ergh.. Ted is different

05:42.638 --> 05:45.442
I apologised to him and he's so mad at me

05:45.442 --> 05:46.382
i should be mad at him

05:46.382 --> 05:48.335
I am mad at him

05:48.335 --> 05:52.735
I'm sucking at rythm gaming just because i tried to fix his problems

05:52.735 --> 05:58.111
Woah, Ki you can't always fix other people's problems for them

05:58.880 --> 06:00.578
I mean sometimes

06:00.578 --> 06:05.059
problems are just unsolvable

06:06.086 --> 06:09.036
like the Hars conjuncture?

06:11.157 --> 06:14.368
Think it like this

06:14.368 --> 06:19.963
Ted is.. like you Gumbac

06:19.963 --> 06:21.545
That you've been looking on

06:21.545 --> 06:24.146
I mean sure, sometimes he get knocked around but

06:24.146 --> 06:27.616
you gotta trust himself to pick him back up

06:27.616 --> 06:30.906
even though he doesn't know you have to see

06:35.840 --> 06:39.073
Brian

06:41.778 --> 06:44.341
thank you

07:04.250 --> 07:07.955
So you're running an arcade now?

07:07.955 --> 07:10.966
Hey Jenny

07:13.257 --> 07:14.290
It's pretty rad

07:14.290 --> 07:15.220
Best thing ever right?

07:15.220 --> 07:16.982
I know, but

07:16.982 --> 07:20.032
i'm kinda busy at the momento so...

07:20.032 --> 07:23.150
Look Brian, i'm not really the best at apologises

07:23.150 --> 07:25.053
but i just wanted

07:25.053 --> 07:26.947
Jenny we're cool, i mean

07:26.947 --> 07:29.452
i was being a jerk too

07:29.452 --> 07:32.660
Now why don't you go play some games, like

07:32.660 --> 07:34.434
over there?

07:34.434 --> 07:37.404
on the house

07:37.404 --> 07:42.801
Okay still you're getting kicked out and

07:42.801 --> 07:48.964

07:51.223 --> 07:52.206
it worked out for the better

07:52.206 --> 07:57.106

07:57.106 --> 07:59.821
Ted was actually in here, like telling me i can actually try out and stuff

07:59.821 --> 08:02.203
You can still try out tomorrow?

08:02.203 --> 08:04.103
Yeah but it's not like it did let me get back in

08:04.103 --> 08:05.609
So what??

08:05.609 --> 08:08.770
People are saying that i can't make Varsity just because i broke up with the law

08:08.770 --> 08:13.319
but you know what if i kick enough ass out there there's nothing he can do to stop it

08:13.319 --> 08:16.735
I'm sorry i tought that playing at VGHS was like your dream or whatever

08:16.735 --> 08:21.106
you're telling me you have one last shot at your dream and you're just gonna walk away?

08:21.106 --> 08:26.971
seriously what the hell is wrong with you, really?

08:26.971 --> 08:28.300
Broke up with the Law?

08:28.300 --> 08:28.816
oh my god

08:28.816 --> 08:30.476
that's what you've got out of this

08:30.476 --> 08:35.530
No, i mean, i was just saying

08:35.530 --> 08:38.604
You really think i've got a shot?

08:38.604 --> 08:40.071
At the tryouts

08:40.071 --> 08:41.018
yeah

08:41.018 --> 08:42.708

08:42.708 --> 08:43.691
That's what i meant

08:43.691 --> 08:45.362

09:10.847 --> 09:12.822
