Stewie, how could this happen?
We're best friends.

12:27.472 --> 12:29.989
Sadly, it doesn't appear
we stay that way.

12:30.066 --> 12:33.476
I found this coin
in his battery box from 2060.

12:33.495 --> 12:35.661
That must be the year
he was sent from.

12:35.663 --> 12:37.830
Eric Trump is on it. Ew.

12:37.832 --> 12:39.999
Stewie, I would never try to--
Really? Ew.

12:40.151 --> 12:43.595
Brian, we need to go to 2060
to find out what happened.

12:43.597 --> 12:46.823
That's not your normal time pad.
Where'd you get that?

12:46.825 --> 12:48.341
I borrowed it
from<i> Rick and Morty.</i>

12:48.493 --> 12:50.226
They've borrowed plenty from us.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.693
(lasers firing)

13:06.511 --> 13:09.621
Oh, my God, it's all true.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.879
Sir, the Bri-bots are advancing.

13:20.449 --> 13:22.449
Brian, look. There I am.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.784
Why are you wearing
a half shirt?

13:23.862 --> 13:26.379
Probably 'cause, like,
war and stuff.

13:26.531 --> 13:27.697
Wait, Stewie,
where are you going?

13:27.699 --> 13:29.365
I have to talk to myself, Brian,

13:29.367 --> 13:30.550
and find out what happened.

13:30.702 --> 13:32.368
Plus, can you imagine
how many likes

13:32.370 --> 13:33.961
this post gets on Instagram?

13:34.039 --> 13:35.705
Me with future me?

13:35.707 --> 13:38.691
That's like "Stewie won
the Internet" good.

13:41.713 --> 13:42.862
BOTH:
Brian?

13:44.065 --> 13:46.549
(gasps)
You're me.

13:46.551 --> 13:48.718
Yes. I've come because
my Terminator robot

13:48.736 --> 13:50.053
just tried to kill me.

13:50.071 --> 13:52.388
What happened?
Brian and I were friends.

13:52.407 --> 13:55.058
He ruined what could have been
a perfect Instagram post

13:55.060 --> 13:56.576
with a sarcastic comment.

13:56.652 --> 13:58.394
Ugh, I hate that.

13:58.396 --> 14:00.730
Oh, that reminds me,
I've got to get this pic.

14:00.732 --> 14:02.398
Wait a minute, what should
we do in the picture?

14:02.417 --> 14:03.900
I don't know, something fun?

14:03.918 --> 14:05.735
Well, the caption is going
to be "Double Trouble,"

14:05.753 --> 14:07.828
so let's work backwards
from there.

14:07.848 --> 14:10.423
♪<i> Have you heard?</i>
<i> It's in the stars</i> ♪

14:10.499 --> 14:13.910
♪<i> Next July we collide</i>
<i> with Mars.</i> ♪

14:13.928 --> 14:17.671
So I have to ask.
Is there a Mrs. Stewie Griffin?

14:17.749 --> 14:19.506
Oh, man, I so wanted to.

14:19.584 --> 14:21.008
It's just this war
and whatnot, you know?

14:21.010 --> 14:22.509
No, no, I totally get it.

14:22.511 --> 14:24.770
Wait a minute,
since there's two of us,

14:24.847 --> 14:26.513
this means we can finally...

14:26.533 --> 14:28.091
BOTH:
...catch our own tail.

14:28.093 --> 14:29.850
(growling, grumbling)

14:29.852 --> 14:31.777
-I got it.
-No, I got it.

14:31.854 --> 14:33.446
-No, I got it.
-I got it.

14:33.522 --> 14:35.290
(grumbling)

14:37.693 --> 14:39.419
There they are. Get 'em.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.925
Brian, we've got
to get out of here.

14:48.871 --> 14:51.631
Oh, Stewie, my hero.

14:51.707 --> 14:53.540
Not now, babe. The war.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.785
All right, jump,
touch the branch,

14:55.787 --> 14:58.563
send these right back
to Zappos for the refund.

15:01.717 --> 15:05.904
My God, we do become enemies.
That makes me sad.

15:05.980 --> 15:07.980
Look, that future
hasn't happened yet.

15:08.057 --> 15:11.576
We can avoid it by protecting
our friendship at all costs.

15:11.653 --> 15:13.653
You're right.
We just need a car,

15:13.729 --> 15:14.913
then we can figure out
how to do this.

15:14.989 --> 15:16.581
Just like the fat man
figured out

15:16.658 --> 15:18.658
how to get into
cosmetology school.

15:18.660 --> 15:20.993
Hi, I'm a drug addict
with a child.

15:20.995 --> 15:22.587
All right, come on in.

15:22.664 --> 15:25.757
And, um, will I be using
the little head rakes?

15:25.833 --> 15:29.385
-You mean combs?
-I have so much to learn.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.989
Hey, love you, buddy.

15:32.991 --> 15:34.657
Love you, too, pal.

15:34.659 --> 15:36.008
See? This is fine.
Friends forever.

15:36.161 --> 15:38.102
We control our own fate.

15:38.179 --> 15:41.481
Yes. Nothing is set in stone.
We make our own decisions.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.777
-Do we really need the heat on?
-It's the defrost.

15:45.853 --> 15:47.612
But whatever it is,
do you really need it on?

15:47.614 --> 15:50.506
If you want me to see
out the window, yes.

15:50.525 --> 15:52.433
Of course, you're the driver.
Sorry.

15:52.510 --> 15:55.286
-Love you, buddy.
-Love you, buddy.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.038
Do you really think
sunflower seeds is

16:06.191 --> 16:07.632
the best choice of snack

16:07.783 --> 16:09.692
-while we're trying
not to hate each other?
-What?

16:09.694 --> 16:11.694
I'm just thinking
maybe there's a better snack.

16:11.696 --> 16:13.787
That's-- I-I don't know.
I love you, buddy.

16:13.865 --> 16:15.807
Okay, that's cool.
But maybe you just, uh,

16:15.958 --> 16:19.702
let me eat whatever I feel like.
Love you, buddy.

16:19.704 --> 16:22.814
My "driving exactly
the speed limit" buddy.

16:22.965 --> 16:24.707
(siren blaring)

16:24.726 --> 16:25.966
Damn it. How am I
getting pulled over?

16:26.044 --> 16:27.710
I was driving exactly
the speed limit.

16:27.712 --> 16:29.195
You sure were.

16:33.827 --> 16:36.385
This cop looks like Lois.

16:36.387 --> 16:38.571
(robotic voice):
Hello, Brian.

16:38.647 --> 16:41.582
Brian, that's not a cop.
That's a Lois Terminator.

16:43.745 --> 16:45.795
(gunshot)

16:48.900 --> 16:51.426
<i> Jingle All the Way.</i>

16:58.501 --> 17:01.227
Oh, yeah? Watch this.

17:03.081 --> 17:06.340
Uhp, guess I'm back
to the old-model Terminator.

17:06.342 --> 17:08.842
Artists must've got tired
of drawing the new one.

17:08.862 --> 17:12.088
Yeah, that's it. Punch that one.

17:12.090 --> 17:14.574
Look out behind you.
No, behind you.

17:25.861 --> 17:27.545
What the hell is going on?

17:27.622 --> 17:29.789
Future me must have sent her
back to protect me

17:29.865 --> 17:32.441
-and kill you.
-(wind whooshing)

17:32.443 --> 17:33.426
Oh, my God, look.

17:40.042 --> 17:41.634
Our future selves must know

17:41.710 --> 17:43.561
we're deprogramming
their Terminators.

17:43.638 --> 17:44.970
They're sending back more.

17:45.047 --> 17:48.624
Is this the Conover
family reunion?

17:48.643 --> 17:50.309
I'm looking around...

17:50.386 --> 17:53.613
This is not.
This is not.

18:01.823 --> 18:03.706
(tires screeching)

18:08.830 --> 18:10.421
Stewie, what the hell
are we gonna do?

18:10.498 --> 18:12.924
Our future selves will continue
sending Terminators back

18:13.000 --> 18:15.835
-to kill us as long
as we're enemies.
-(phone chimes)

18:15.987 --> 18:19.597
Oh, "Brian Griffin has commented
on your Instagram post."

18:24.162 --> 18:26.829
"When Sally Met Sally"?
What the hell?!

18:26.831 --> 18:28.664
Relax, Stewie.
Take a joke.

18:28.666 --> 18:30.666
Come on, Brian,
an early sarcastic comment

18:30.668 --> 18:32.501
brings likes to a grinding halt.

18:32.503 --> 18:34.428
Oh, my God, your comment
is getting

18:34.505 --> 18:35.613
more likes than the post.

18:35.690 --> 18:37.481
Stewie, you can't post
a picture like that.

18:37.483 --> 18:39.450
It's so clear you're just
in love with yourself.

18:39.527 --> 18:41.602
Says the guy
who constantly updates

18:41.679 --> 18:42.787
his own Wikipedia page.

18:42.938 --> 18:44.455
That's supposed to be anonymous.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.850
-Oh, like all your
alcoholic buddies?
-Go to hell!

18:47.852 --> 18:49.293
(tires screeching)

18:49.445 --> 18:51.963
-You go to hell.
-(grunting)

18:53.633 --> 18:55.616
Wait, stop.
Don't you see, Brian?

18:55.693 --> 18:57.784
This is it.
This is the rift.

18:57.862 --> 19:00.429
Oh, my God, you're right.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.959
Here come the Terminators.
What do we do?

19:06.037 --> 19:08.387
We've got to show them that
our friendship is unbreakable.

19:08.464 --> 19:10.481
That we love each other.

19:10.483 --> 19:13.967
-Brian, we have to kiss.
-Oh, come on, Stewie.

19:14.045 --> 19:15.878
No, no, no, no, no.
I-I know I can sometimes

19:15.897 --> 19:17.880
do stuff like this,
and again I apologize

19:17.882 --> 19:19.899
for what happened at the motel;
that was a big mix-up.

19:19.975 --> 19:22.401
But the writer in you
knows it's true.

19:22.478 --> 19:23.578
All right, fine.

19:26.649 --> 19:29.208
-Stewie...
-I'm doing it for you.

19:39.587 --> 19:41.995
-Brian, it's working.
-How much longer?

19:42.073 --> 19:43.931
Sorry, didn't realize
it was such a chore.

19:49.004 --> 19:50.930
What about now?

19:51.006 --> 19:52.690
Almost, Brian.
Keep kissing.

19:58.514 --> 19:59.697

of<i> Family Guy</i> theme playing)
