00:35.744 --> 00:38.740
Damn, that thing's heavy.

00:38.741 --> 00:40.260
Think Karla put enough ice in here?

00:40.261 --> 00:41.746
Well, you're the idiot that told her

00:41.747 --> 00:44.330
we were takin' the boy fishin'.

00:52.107 --> 00:54.562
Well, at least she
packed some soda for him.

00:54.563 --> 00:58.701
Nah, give one of
those beers to Ronnie.

00:58.702 --> 01:00.338
You sure about that, Dean?

01:00.339 --> 01:01.468
Hell, I was about his age

01:01.469 --> 01:03.374
when I had my first one.

01:03.375 --> 01:04.208
Go ahead.

01:05.759 --> 01:06.814
Go on, Ronnie, it's okay.

01:06.815 --> 01:08.490
I won't tell your mom.

01:08.491 --> 01:11.324
Um, thanks, Mr. Waters.

01:15.856 --> 01:17.948
Don't worry about that.

01:17.949 --> 01:18.838
You'll get used to it.

01:18.839 --> 01:20.421
Just keep drinkin'.

01:21.835 --> 01:24.310
So why did you
bring your nephew?

01:24.311 --> 01:25.578
I had to.

01:25.579 --> 01:27.320
Ma's on that weekend trip
with her church group,

01:27.321 --> 01:29.618
and Kim won't be back
for him until Tuesday.

01:29.619 --> 01:31.717
Well, you better catch
somethin' before I get back.

01:31.718 --> 01:32.732
We will.

01:32.733 --> 01:34.263
When you get back?

01:34.264 --> 01:35.467
I'm headin' out now.

01:35.468 --> 01:37.908
The bitch hates it when I'm late.

01:37.909 --> 01:41.203
You're leavin' us out here?

01:41.204 --> 01:42.177
Uh huh.

01:42.177 --> 01:43.113
Didn't your Uncle Dean tell you

01:43.114 --> 01:45.293
you'd be walkin' home?

01:45.294 --> 01:47.255
He's just fuckin' with ya, Ronnie.

01:47.256 --> 01:49.358
Frank here has got himself
a sweet little lady friend

01:49.359 --> 01:52.424
on the side that his
wife don't know about.

01:52.425 --> 01:54.986
So, why are we here?

01:54.987 --> 01:56.873
Because Karla saw us leave with him,

01:56.874 --> 01:59.884
and she'll see us with
him when he gets back.

01:59.885 --> 02:01.455
Oh, I get it.

02:01.456 --> 02:05.060
You're a right smart boy, aren't ya?

02:05.061 --> 02:06.819
Have fun babysittin'.

02:12.668 --> 02:14.751
So how long will he be?

02:16.246 --> 02:17.780
Few hours.

02:17.781 --> 02:20.062
And we just sit here?

02:20.063 --> 02:20.896
Yep.

02:22.361 --> 02:24.409
Shouldn't we start fishing?

02:24.410 --> 02:26.388
Have yourself another beer.

02:47.002 --> 02:48.335
What the fuck?

02:56.007 --> 02:56.958
Oh yeah?

02:56.959 --> 02:59.625
Well bring it on, you crazy bitch.

02:59.626 --> 03:01.844
I'm telling you, he's not here!

03:01.845 --> 03:04.813
Now stop fucking calling me.

03:13.439 --> 03:15.310
Hey there, sexy.

03:15.311 --> 03:16.965
I know you're working
the graveyard shift

03:16.966 --> 03:18.719
but I thought we could get together

03:18.720 --> 03:21.070
tomorrow at Mom's place.

03:21.071 --> 03:22.814
I'll be waiting.

03:44.367 --> 03:47.700
Still pretty good for your first time.

03:51.941 --> 03:55.322
I feel really sick, Uncle Dean.

03:55.323 --> 03:56.421
Frank will be here soon,

03:56.422 --> 03:59.339
then we'll get you home and in bed.

04:02.156 --> 04:06.159
My dad had a friend who
used to make moonshine.

04:06.160 --> 04:09.234
Fucking puked my guts everywhere

04:09.235 --> 04:10.902
when I first had it.

04:12.314 --> 04:14.241
But then he started
mixing it with lemonade,

04:14.242 --> 04:17.329
and I have never puked since.

04:17.329 --> 04:19.720
Maybe we'll do that for you next time.

04:19.721 --> 04:21.053
That sound good?

04:22.245 --> 04:26.127
My stomach, it hurts real bad.

04:26.128 --> 04:28.172
Aw, come on, you didn't have that much.

04:28.173 --> 04:30.256
You had, what, maybe two?

04:32.452 --> 04:33.601
Tell you what,

04:33.602 --> 04:35.160
you stay here,

04:35.161 --> 04:36.692
I'll go to the road
and see if I can get us

04:36.693 --> 04:38.193
a ride home, okay?

07:59.867 --> 08:01.857
Dean?

08:01.858 --> 08:03.679
Hey, buddy, you okay?

08:04.647 --> 08:05.840
What?

08:05.841 --> 08:07.168
It's me, Cob.

08:07.169 --> 08:08.579
You get lost out here?

08:08.580 --> 08:10.308
No, I,

08:10.309 --> 08:11.737
I don't know what the
heck I'm doin' out here.

08:11.738 --> 08:13.383
You gotta ease up on that bottle.

08:13.384 --> 08:14.348
It'll be liable to.

08:15.181 --> 08:16.014
Oh my God.

08:16.015 --> 08:17.923
What happened to you?

08:17.924 --> 08:20.008
I ran into somethin'?

08:20.009 --> 08:21.901
Yeah, you got caught
on somethin' real bad.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.805
Probably one of those sharp branches.

08:23.806 --> 08:26.054
We better get ya to a doctor right away.

08:26.055 --> 08:26.933
No, no,

08:26.934 --> 08:30.019
we, uh, gotta go get Ronnie first.

08:30.020 --> 08:31.665
You brought the boy with you?

08:31.666 --> 08:33.092
Your sister's gonna have your hide

08:33.092 --> 08:36.172
if she smells any liquor on him.

08:36.173 --> 08:37.504
Where's he at?

08:37.505 --> 08:38.972
Um,

08:38.974 --> 08:40.909
down the road.

08:40.909 --> 08:42.922
Oh boy, come on.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.922
Let me get ya up here.

08:46.011 --> 08:48.011
All right.
Oh my God.

08:52.826 --> 08:53.895
Ronnie?

08:55.391 --> 08:56.323
Ronnie?

08:56.324 --> 08:58.051
You can come out now.

08:58.052 --> 09:00.014
We're gonna take you
home to your grandma's.

09:04.020 --> 09:06.186
And you're sure you
left him around here?

09:06.187 --> 09:08.518
Yeah, see, there's
our cooler right here.

09:08.519 --> 09:10.589
All right, well,
sit here a second.

09:14.451 --> 09:15.920
Oh, look, there's his shoe.

09:15.921 --> 09:18.458
He's probably passed out
over there somewhere.

09:18.459 --> 09:20.131
Ah, Dean.

09:20.132 --> 09:21.299
I'll go get him.

09:34.493 --> 09:35.326
Oh.

09:35.326 --> 09:36.159
Oh my God.

09:38.133 --> 09:39.035
Oh, Ronnie.

09:55.145 --> 09:56.982
Hello, Patty?

09:56.983 --> 10:00.825
Yeah, I need to talk to
the sheriff right away.

10:00.826 --> 10:02.159
Yes, right away.

10:09.138 --> 10:10.603
Ah, no you don't.

10:12.306 --> 10:14.447
Damn, how can you have so much energy

10:14.448 --> 10:17.009
comin' off the late shift?

10:17.010 --> 10:18.764
I sleep in the car.

10:18.765 --> 10:20.054
Bad guys don't mind.

10:22.112 --> 10:24.305
I think you're the baddest guy in town.

10:24.306 --> 10:25.139
Do you?

10:30.082 --> 10:31.271
If the sheriff's calling before noon

10:31.272 --> 10:33.839
then it's something important.

10:33.840 --> 10:35.007
The sheriff?

10:36.336 --> 10:38.501
But he's not even your boss.

10:38.502 --> 10:40.406
Yeah, well if I wanna
finalize this transfer

10:40.407 --> 10:41.844
then he kinda is.

10:41.845 --> 10:44.453
Don't worry, I'll be
runnin' things soon here.

10:44.454 --> 10:47.964
For now, I just gotta
keep the old man happy.

10:47.965 --> 10:51.267
Well then, maybe I should
just call someone else.

10:51.268 --> 10:53.185
I bet Robert's up, too.

10:56.468 --> 10:58.223
You know I'm just playing with you.

10:59.086 --> 10:59.919
I wouldn't.

11:02.128 --> 11:04.406
I gotta take this.

11:04.407 --> 11:05.907
Good morning, sir.

11:07.424 --> 11:10.091
No, I'm not at my house, I'm at.

11:11.264 --> 11:12.764
You're kiddin' me.

11:23.560 --> 11:26.125
You weren't
kiddin' about how nasty

11:26.126 --> 11:27.837
this one is.

11:27.838 --> 11:29.279
Where in the hell you been?

11:29.280 --> 11:31.924
Patty's been tryin' to ring
you at home all mornin'.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.803
I was with someone, Sheriff.

11:33.804 --> 11:35.847
You best get Patty that
cell number of yours.

11:35.848 --> 11:37.794
Took me over 40 minutes to get out here.

11:37.795 --> 11:39.702
Would've taken you less than three.

11:39.703 --> 11:42.594
Sorry, Sheriff.

11:42.595 --> 11:43.760
Just get to it.

11:43.761 --> 11:45.745
I'm sure you know the drill.

11:48.583 --> 11:49.730
So what do you think?

11:49.731 --> 11:50.564
Gator?

11:52.533 --> 11:53.366
No.

11:54.645 --> 11:56.756
Definitely a bear.

11:56.757 --> 11:57.798
I've seen this kind of mess before

11:57.799 --> 11:59.773
up in the Rockies.

11:59.774 --> 12:02.788
A bear attack in broad daylight?

12:02.789 --> 12:07.106
Hungry bear doesn't give a
damn what time of day it is.

12:07.107 --> 12:10.168
All right, when you finish
up with this, just

12:10.169 --> 12:13.586
call the wagon to come
get this poor kid.

12:14.558 --> 12:15.475
Yes, sir.

12:17.606 --> 12:21.174
Looks like Sheriff McKenny's
comin' back over now.

12:21.175 --> 12:23.353
Just tell him everything you remember.

12:23.354 --> 12:25.079
This ain't your fault, Dean.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.633
Yeah, well fuckin'
cops always find a way

12:26.634 --> 12:28.884
to blame me for everything.

12:31.332 --> 12:32.832
Is that exactly
how you found him, Cob?

12:32.833 --> 12:34.431
Yes, sir, Sheriff McKenny.

12:34.432 --> 12:35.669
And Dean here

12:35.670 --> 12:38.411
was a quarter mile down the path there.

12:38.412 --> 12:39.908
All right.

12:39.909 --> 12:41.043
So what were you and your nephew doin'

12:41.044 --> 12:42.569
all the way out here?

12:42.570 --> 12:45.007
We weren't doin'
nothin' but drinkin'.

12:45.008 --> 12:45.841
Well how'd you get out here?

12:45.842 --> 12:47.616
'Cause I haven't seen your car anywhere.

12:47.617 --> 12:49.200
We walked.

12:50.232 --> 12:51.373
Cut the shit, Dean.

12:51.374 --> 12:53.415
Now that's your nephew
all torn up under there.

12:53.416 --> 12:54.637
Least you can do is be straight with me

12:54.638 --> 12:56.555
on how he got that way.

12:57.803 --> 13:00.752
All right, Frank dropped us off, okay?

13:00.753 --> 13:01.824
Frank Waters?

13:01.825 --> 13:03.125
Yeah.

13:03.126 --> 13:04.359
He just dropped you and Ronnie off

13:04.360 --> 13:06.005
and then took off.

13:06.006 --> 13:06.839
Yeah.

13:07.977 --> 13:08.819
Well that's pretty funny

13:08.820 --> 13:10.611
'cause Karla Waters has
been callin' the station

13:10.612 --> 13:15.193
all mornin' 'cause he
didn't come home last night.

13:15.194 --> 13:17.333
Where did Mr. Waters go?

13:17.334 --> 13:18.388
I don't know.

13:18.389 --> 13:19.637
He said he had somethin' to do

13:19.638 --> 13:22.517
and then he'd be back for us later.

13:22.518 --> 13:24.268
All right, come on.

13:25.864 --> 13:27.178
Officer Ambrose.

13:27.179 --> 13:28.156
Sir?

13:28.157 --> 13:29.263
I need you to wait on the coroner

13:29.264 --> 13:30.843
while I take Mr. Clout
here to the hospital.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.222
I'm not goin' to the hospital.

13:32.223 --> 13:33.970
I gotta get home.

13:33.971 --> 13:36.368
Shit, Mama's comin' home today.

13:36.369 --> 13:38.825
Dean, you need to get
yourself taken care of.

13:38.826 --> 13:40.755
You're pretty torn up.

13:40.756 --> 13:42.586
Yeah, I'm fine, it doesn't hurt.

13:42.587 --> 13:44.718
He may be goin' into shock, Sheriff.

13:44.719 --> 13:46.285
Officer Ambrose can go see your mama

13:46.286 --> 13:47.931
after the coroner gets here.

13:47.932 --> 13:49.547
You understand?

13:49.548 --> 13:51.727
Cob, can you go see to Ma?

13:51.728 --> 13:54.075
I can along with them,
don't you worry about it.

13:54.076 --> 13:58.076
Best she hear about this
from someone she knows.

14:33.124 --> 14:34.753
Hi.

14:34.754 --> 14:38.758
Yeah, I'd like to get a
rental in Springvale, Florida.

14:38.759 --> 14:40.092
A house, please.

15:09.475 --> 15:13.642
I left another message for
George again this morning.

15:14.561 --> 15:17.263
He won't return any of my calls.

15:17.264 --> 15:19.677
Christ, he doesn't even know.

15:19.678 --> 15:21.746
Maybe you should just tell his wife.

15:21.747 --> 15:22.580
No!

15:27.478 --> 15:30.770
I should be the one

15:30.771 --> 15:33.354
to tell him that Ronnie's gone.

15:34.243 --> 15:35.926
He needs to know,

15:35.927 --> 15:37.368
and if he won't answer your calls...

15:37.369 --> 15:39.952
It's our son for fuck's sake.

15:41.072 --> 15:44.619
He can't even talk to me
for two goddamn minutes?

15:44.620 --> 15:46.995
The funeral is on Wednesday.

15:46.996 --> 15:48.496
He should be here.

15:49.438 --> 15:50.738
Why don't you let me call him?

15:50.739 --> 15:52.239
Ma, I'm just so,

15:53.635 --> 15:54.922
so

15:54.923 --> 15:56.486
Angry!

15:56.487 --> 15:57.904
It's all right.

15:58.928 --> 16:00.419
Let it out.

16:00.420 --> 16:02.038
Just let it all out.

16:11.489 --> 16:12.562
Hello?

16:12.563 --> 16:13.396
George?

16:15.125 --> 16:16.292
Oh, hi, Karla.

16:19.788 --> 16:21.284
I'm,

16:21.285 --> 16:22.952
I'm holdin' up okay.

16:24.204 --> 16:25.621
It's Karla again.

16:30.556 --> 16:32.389
No, he's still asleep.

16:35.337 --> 16:37.796
We haven't heard anything yet.

16:39.827 --> 16:40.660
Dean?

16:42.115 --> 16:44.782
Dean, wake up, it's almost noon.

16:48.533 --> 16:50.726
Dean, can you hear me?

16:50.727 --> 16:52.168
Yeah, I hear ya, Ma.

16:52.169 --> 16:54.363
Dean, Frank's
wife's on the phone.

16:54.364 --> 16:56.614
She's been calling all day.

16:58.186 --> 16:59.764
I'm not feelin' good.

16:59.765 --> 17:02.182
Tell her I'll see her Sunday.

17:03.948 --> 17:05.828
Yeah, I know,

17:05.829 --> 17:07.814
but you're just going
to have to face the fact

17:07.815 --> 17:08.815
that he was,

17:10.310 --> 17:11.532
I mean,

17:11.534 --> 17:14.367
they didn't find his truck, right?

17:16.663 --> 17:18.579
Hold on a second, okay?

17:21.326 --> 17:23.351
Now, Karla, you listen to me.

17:23.352 --> 17:25.998
Dean just told me that
he'd be along to see you

17:25.999 --> 17:26.832
on Sunday.

17:27.820 --> 17:30.786
You have got to stop pestering Kimberly.

17:30.787 --> 17:32.420
She has got bigger
problems to worry about

17:32.421 --> 17:33.956
than your no-good husband.

17:36.700 --> 17:38.204
Ma!

17:38.205 --> 17:39.579
That was rude.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.855
You just lost your son

17:41.856 --> 17:42.992
and she's whining to you

17:42.993 --> 17:46.134
about how her husband run off on her?

17:46.135 --> 17:47.765
I think she's the one who needs to learn

17:47.766 --> 17:49.433
to mind her manners.

18:02.949 --> 18:03.963
I hope you didn't have any trouble

18:03.964 --> 18:05.252
findin' the place, Mr. Reading.

18:05.253 --> 18:06.800
Oh, not a problem.

18:06.801 --> 18:07.803
Are you Mrs. Wilson?

18:07.804 --> 18:10.051
I'm Shari.

18:10.052 --> 18:11.423
Mom owns this place.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.437
You seemed a bit young to be the woman

18:12.438 --> 18:14.012
I talked to on the phone.

18:14.013 --> 18:15.165
Mom doesn't drive much anymore,

18:15.166 --> 18:17.195
so she sent me out here to
give you the grand tour.

18:18.030 --> 18:19.993
And the keys to the manor.

18:19.994 --> 18:21.748
Do you get a lot of
renters all the way out here?

18:21.749 --> 18:23.327
It's a big house so
we usually rent it out

18:23.328 --> 18:25.616
for fishin' groups for the weekend.

18:25.617 --> 18:26.781
What about hunting?

18:26.782 --> 18:27.615
That, too.

18:27.616 --> 18:28.676
Lot of deer out here.

18:28.677 --> 18:30.099
You staying up here all by yourself?

18:30.100 --> 18:31.951
Uh, no, not really.

18:31.952 --> 18:33.405
Wife's bringin' the kids next week.

18:33.406 --> 18:36.231
Oh, Mom didn't say anything about that.

18:36.232 --> 18:39.165
Well, it's the perfect
place for a family vacation.

18:39.166 --> 18:40.893
Let me show you around the house.

18:40.894 --> 18:42.838
Your mom mentioned a barn out back.

18:42.839 --> 18:43.672
Can I see it?

18:53.138 --> 18:54.454
I wouldn't call it a barn.

18:54.455 --> 18:55.974
I mean, it used to be,

18:55.975 --> 18:58.376
but now there's just a
bunch of junk in there.

18:58.377 --> 19:00.186
And you do have to deal
with ole Bessie here.

19:00.187 --> 19:02.687
Not a problem.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.866
Daddy was a junk man.

19:07.867 --> 19:09.594
I've been meanin' to clean
this place out for years

19:09.595 --> 19:11.606
but haven't gotten the time.

19:11.607 --> 19:13.541
Looks like there's a little room left.

19:13.542 --> 19:15.860
You mind if I park some
bikes in here for the kids?

19:15.861 --> 19:18.944
Small keys will open it up.

19:32.360 --> 19:34.773
Frank, where the hell are you?

19:34.774 --> 19:35.607
Call me.

19:46.741 --> 19:47.574
Oh, Dean.

19:49.719 --> 19:52.048
I thought you were.

19:52.049 --> 19:54.882
No one's seen him, Karla.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.450
I'm just so scared.

20:02.451 --> 20:03.998
After what happened to Ronnie.

20:03.999 --> 20:06.208
Frank didn't get eaten by a bear, honey.

20:06.209 --> 20:08.137
He left before we were attacked.

20:08.138 --> 20:08.971
I know.

20:08.972 --> 20:10.595
His truck is gone.

20:10.596 --> 20:12.601
The police think he just took off.

20:12.602 --> 20:15.185
But why would he do that to me?

20:16.113 --> 20:18.400
He had another woman on the side.

20:18.401 --> 20:20.528
Maybe he just, you know?

20:20.529 --> 20:21.939
I know all about that.

20:21.940 --> 20:24.051
He's fucking Shari Wilson.

20:24.052 --> 20:25.301
He was fucking Shari?

20:25.302 --> 20:27.239
He and half the town.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.713
But he didn't see her that night.

20:28.714 --> 20:29.798
I called her.

20:29.799 --> 20:31.385
Oh, like she'd tell you if she did.

20:31.386 --> 20:32.744
She was pretty pissed off

20:32.745 --> 20:34.390
about being stood up.

20:34.391 --> 20:35.707
I could tell that much,

20:35.708 --> 20:37.243
even if she wouldn't admit it.

20:37.244 --> 20:38.555
Did you tell the cops about this?

20:38.556 --> 20:39.837
Of course I did.

20:39.838 --> 20:41.933
They talked to her, too.

20:41.934 --> 20:43.359
Those assholes think he's got

20:43.360 --> 20:46.694
another woman somewhere
that no one knows about.

20:46.695 --> 20:48.695
All cops are assholes.

20:50.123 --> 20:52.728
Do you think maybe
he found out about us?

20:52.729 --> 20:54.292
Maybe that's why he dumped
you out in the woods

20:54.293 --> 20:55.543
before he left?

21:02.920 --> 21:03.753
I've seen a couple of bears

21:03.754 --> 21:04.868
over the last few years,

21:04.869 --> 21:07.325
but never this close to us.

21:07.326 --> 21:09.217
They usually stay out in Ocala.

21:09.218 --> 21:10.436
It's not unusual, Sheriff.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.548
Been a lot of towns troubled
by all kinds of animals.

21:12.549 --> 21:13.469
The land gets developed,

21:13.470 --> 21:15.472
and the wildlife just
have no place to go.

21:15.473 --> 21:18.042
Even had a bear in a suburb
of Philadelphia last year.

21:18.043 --> 21:20.235
Hmm, nothin' been built around here.

21:20.236 --> 21:21.901
It's mostly just swampland.

21:21.902 --> 21:23.579
So there were two victims?

21:23.580 --> 21:24.413
Yep.

21:24.413 --> 21:25.287
One of our local hell-raisers

21:25.288 --> 21:27.232
brought his nephew out here.

21:27.233 --> 21:28.301
He was on the path here,

21:28.302 --> 21:31.072
and the boy was a little
further down the woods there.

21:31.073 --> 21:33.169
Can I see the body?

21:33.170 --> 21:35.043
You don't wanna see that.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.163
That kid was 10 years old.

21:37.164 --> 21:39.694
Pretty much ripped in half.

21:39.695 --> 21:41.787
I've seen worse injuries like that.

21:41.788 --> 21:42.791
I'm sure you've seen a lot of stuff

21:42.792 --> 21:43.932
in your research and all,

21:43.933 --> 21:45.933
but this was really bad.

21:47.148 --> 21:48.813
Keeps me up at night.

21:48.814 --> 21:50.446
I'd also like to interview the survivor.

21:50.447 --> 21:51.641
Mr. Clout?

21:51.642 --> 21:53.079
Can you arrange that with the hospital?

21:53.080 --> 21:54.388
The hospital?

21:54.389 --> 21:56.521
Dean's not at the hospital.

21:56.522 --> 21:57.899
So he didn't survive?

21:57.900 --> 21:58.883
Yeah.

21:58.884 --> 22:00.133
He's back home.

22:02.707 --> 22:04.722
But the report said he
was raked across the back.

22:04.723 --> 22:07.740
That'd cause excessive
muscle damage and blood loss,

22:07.741 --> 22:09.324
even spinal trauma.

22:10.159 --> 22:11.495
That's the queer thing.

22:11.496 --> 22:13.019
When Mr. Hill found him,

22:13.020 --> 22:13.873
he was a real mess,

22:13.874 --> 22:17.482
but when the hospital cut his shirt off,

22:17.483 --> 22:19.400
it didn't seem too bad.

22:33.414 --> 22:37.581
Officer Ambrose, we're
gettin' on back to town now.

22:39.596 --> 22:41.971
Yeah, I'm comin', Sheriff.

22:47.978 --> 22:48.860
I told you you
wouldn't find anything

22:48.861 --> 22:51.032
that close to the street.

22:51.033 --> 22:53.456
Didn't hurt to check.

22:53.457 --> 22:55.063
What's he looking for?

22:55.064 --> 22:56.416
Ah, we had another
fella go missin' up here

22:56.417 --> 22:57.525
that day.

22:57.526 --> 22:59.858
So you think
you have another victim?

22:59.859 --> 23:03.613
Not unless that bear
knows how to drive a truck.

23:03.614 --> 23:05.376
What's he think?

23:05.377 --> 23:09.682
Well, Officer Ambrose
transferred from Tampa last year.

23:09.683 --> 23:13.255
Still treats everything
like a big city crime scene.

23:30.586 --> 23:31.419
Shit!

23:40.609 --> 23:42.660
Okay.

23:59.310 --> 24:00.227
Mrs. Clout?

24:01.288 --> 24:02.795
My name is Kyle Reading.

24:02.796 --> 24:04.624
I'm with the Wildlife Research Center.

24:04.625 --> 24:05.582
I was wondering if it would be possible

24:05.583 --> 24:07.998
if I could speak to your son.

24:07.999 --> 24:09.605
He's not?

24:09.606 --> 24:10.530
Oh.

24:10.531 --> 24:13.218
I know it's a bad time, but.

24:13.219 --> 24:15.266
You don't mind?

24:15.267 --> 24:17.956
I appreciate that, Mrs. Clout,

24:17.957 --> 24:20.290
and I'm sorry for your loss.

24:23.972 --> 24:25.450
I'll see you then.

24:25.451 --> 24:26.284
Bye.

24:50.825 --> 24:52.121
Louise.

24:52.122 --> 24:52.955
Jacob.

24:56.259 --> 24:57.383
I'm trying.

25:00.513 --> 25:01.436
Thank you, Jacob.

25:01.437 --> 25:02.686
Thank you so much.

25:14.842 --> 25:16.206
Ellen brought some of that potato salad

25:16.207 --> 25:17.624
you like so much.

25:21.100 --> 25:23.118
Kim, you've got to eat something.

25:23.119 --> 25:24.898
I know you don't want to, but.

25:24.899 --> 25:27.003
Is George still here?

25:29.377 --> 25:31.851
He's in the kitchen with Pastor Nichols.

25:31.852 --> 25:33.415
You just stay here and eat,

25:33.416 --> 25:35.333
and he'll be gone soon.

25:39.475 --> 25:40.640
I need to go get a fork.

25:40.641 --> 25:42.174
No!

25:42.175 --> 25:45.175
You need to stay right here and eat.

25:46.870 --> 25:48.346
Dean.

25:48.347 --> 25:49.191
Yeah, Ma?

25:49.192 --> 25:51.221
Go in the kitchen
and get a fork for your sister.

25:51.222 --> 25:52.889
Okay, sure.

25:58.207 --> 26:00.465
I think I'm gonna go back home tonight.

26:00.466 --> 26:02.132
Are you sure?

26:02.133 --> 26:04.123
It's an awfully long drive.

26:04.124 --> 26:05.741
Maybe you oughta stay here
tonight and get some rest

26:05.742 --> 26:07.207
and leave in the morning.

26:07.208 --> 26:08.487
Ma, I just...

26:08.488 --> 26:10.219
You son of a bitch!

26:10.220 --> 26:11.246
You killed my son.

26:11.247 --> 26:12.868
You goddamned son of a bitch!

26:12.869 --> 26:15.614
What the fuck were you
thinking taking him out there?

26:15.615 --> 26:17.915
George, stop it, it's not his fault.

26:17.916 --> 26:20.499
Not his fault, not his fault?

26:21.658 --> 26:24.928
George, perhaps you should sit down.

26:24.929 --> 26:27.394
He took my son out in the
middle of fucking nowhere,

26:27.395 --> 26:28.228
for what?

26:28.229 --> 26:29.764
To be his drinking buddy?

26:29.765 --> 26:32.116
And you, you let him?

26:32.117 --> 26:33.835
Mother of the fucking year!

26:33.836 --> 26:35.187
I didn't know!

26:35.188 --> 26:36.875
How was I supposed to know?

26:36.876 --> 26:38.784
Louise, could you take Kimberly?

26:38.785 --> 26:41.031
I left him here while
I was out with Sylvie.

26:41.032 --> 26:43.067
I didn't know Dean was
gonna take him out.

26:43.068 --> 26:44.985
You left him here
with your drunk-ass brother

26:44.986 --> 26:47.361
while you went out
partyin' with your friends?

26:47.362 --> 26:50.731
Please, George, there's no
need for all this shouting.

26:50.732 --> 26:53.645
You need to calm down now.

26:53.646 --> 26:55.412
I'm okay, Padre, really.

26:55.413 --> 26:57.898
I just wanna know what this
stupid bitch was thinking!

26:57.899 --> 26:58.732
George!

26:59.704 --> 27:04.413
How the fuck
did you ever get custody?

27:04.414 --> 27:06.132
Ma was here.

27:06.133 --> 27:08.383
How was I supposed to know?

27:09.448 --> 27:12.519
You left my son
with a worthless piece of shit

27:12.520 --> 27:14.564
and a senile old lady?

27:14.565 --> 27:16.006
And now he's dead

27:16.007 --> 27:17.257
because of you.

27:18.140 --> 27:18.973
Cunt!

27:18.974 --> 27:21.140
I should fucking kill you!

27:23.471 --> 27:25.788
George, let's go outside.

27:25.789 --> 27:27.339
Settle down.

27:27.340 --> 27:28.757
Let's go outside.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.999
Yeah, get me far away
from this stupid cunt.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.583
Come on, outside.

28:21.130 --> 28:23.134
Mr. Reading.

28:23.135 --> 28:25.976
I thought everyone in town
would be at the funeral by now.

28:25.977 --> 28:27.998
So did I, Officer.

28:27.999 --> 28:30.204
So what are you doin' out here?

28:30.205 --> 28:31.537
Lookin' for your bears?

28:31.538 --> 28:32.650
Yeah.

28:32.651 --> 28:34.584
Just wanderin' the scene.

28:34.585 --> 28:36.328
Tryin' to understand what happened here.

28:36.329 --> 28:37.400
Well, I think it's kind of obvious

28:37.401 --> 28:39.708
what happened here.

28:39.709 --> 28:41.328
Dean takes his nephew out in the forest,

28:41.329 --> 28:45.425
they go stompin' around
all over the place,

28:45.426 --> 28:47.485
somethin' decides to join the party.

28:47.486 --> 28:48.895
Sure seems that way.

28:52.964 --> 28:55.832
Did you need somethin' from me, Officer?

28:55.833 --> 28:56.666
Oh, no.

28:57.957 --> 29:02.065
Fastest abandoned vehicle
case I've ever had to solve.

29:02.066 --> 29:05.149
You have a good evening, Mr. Reading.

29:06.889 --> 29:08.765
Officer.

29:08.766 --> 29:10.260
How'd you get here?

29:10.261 --> 29:13.032
Well, I live right over there.

29:13.033 --> 29:13.943
It's kinda hard to miss the car

29:13.944 --> 29:16.526
that's parked in your backyard.

29:35.931 --> 29:38.133
Where did it happen?

29:38.134 --> 29:40.266
We found him on the fishin' path,

29:40.267 --> 29:43.267
not far from where you used to live.

29:45.444 --> 29:48.229
It's nice up there at least.

29:48.230 --> 29:51.319
You know, we lived
there all those years,

29:51.320 --> 29:53.680
and I never did take Ronnie fishing.

29:53.681 --> 29:55.512
I should've fought harder
to keep him, Boris.

29:55.513 --> 29:57.207
I shouldn't have let that bitch win!

29:57.208 --> 29:58.041
George.

29:58.983 --> 30:01.815
It's just that Karen, my wife,

30:01.816 --> 30:04.146
didn't want another kid in the house.

30:04.147 --> 30:06.991
You know, she has two girls.

30:06.992 --> 30:11.683
I thought Ronnie would
be okay with his mother.

30:11.684 --> 30:15.851
You wanna go to
Leon's and have a couple beers?

30:19.037 --> 30:21.511
I have a long drive home.

31:09.230 --> 31:10.804
Who the fuck are you?

31:10.805 --> 31:12.555
Who the fuck are you?

31:15.373 --> 31:17.486
Please, please, please, please,

31:17.487 --> 31:20.491
please, please, please, please, please.

31:20.492 --> 31:21.517
Please.

32:04.750 --> 32:06.525
Dean, the police are here.

32:06.526 --> 32:08.374
They wanna talk to you.

32:08.375 --> 32:09.926
I ain't talkin' to them.

32:09.927 --> 32:11.872
Dean, you best get yourself out here.

32:11.873 --> 32:14.733
They wanna talk to you about Frank.

32:14.734 --> 32:17.067
Just give me a minute, Ma.

32:24.833 --> 32:26.807
He'll be out in a minute.

32:26.808 --> 32:29.253
Can I get you some coffee?

32:29.254 --> 32:30.134
No, we hate to come out here

32:30.135 --> 32:31.203
and pester you like this, Louise,

32:31.204 --> 32:32.882
but you know how it is.

32:32.883 --> 32:33.991
Now, Boris, you know

32:33.992 --> 32:35.385
I've missed seeing you regular

32:35.386 --> 32:37.189
since Alvin passed.

32:37.190 --> 32:38.554
Who's Alvin?

32:38.555 --> 32:41.938
Alvin was my husband, God rest his soul.

32:41.939 --> 32:45.226
Boris used to find him wanderin'
in the middle of the day,

32:45.227 --> 32:49.818
and he'd always bring him
straight on home to me.

32:49.819 --> 32:51.143
He liked his drink a little earlier

32:51.144 --> 32:53.276
than most people, you know.

32:53.277 --> 32:54.257
That he did.

32:54.258 --> 32:55.580
But he was lucky to
have such a good woman

32:55.581 --> 32:56.699
to take care of him.

32:56.700 --> 32:57.700
As do you.

32:58.893 --> 33:00.893
Now how has Janice been?

33:01.737 --> 33:04.111
I didn't see her at the funeral.

33:04.112 --> 33:05.764
She's fine, she's just out in Texas

33:05.765 --> 33:08.042
visitin' with her sister
for a little while.

33:08.043 --> 33:09.594
No problems at home, I hope.

33:09.595 --> 33:11.273
No, nothin' like that.

33:11.274 --> 33:12.107
Her sister's just gettin' ready

33:12.108 --> 33:14.229
to have another baby.

33:14.230 --> 33:16.987
So, what do the bastards
in blue want this time?

33:16.988 --> 33:17.956
Dean!

33:17.957 --> 33:20.230
Well, I already told
'em everything I know, Ma.

33:20.231 --> 33:22.648
Mr. Clout, can you step outside with us?

33:22.649 --> 33:24.582
Ooh, I'm Mr. Clout now.

33:24.583 --> 33:26.640
I must've done somethin'
real serious this time.

33:26.641 --> 33:28.548
No, I just think we've kept your mother

33:28.549 --> 33:30.995
away from her shows long enough now.

33:30.996 --> 33:31.934
Do you mind?

33:31.935 --> 33:33.071
Yeah, I mind.

33:33.072 --> 33:34.152
Just spit it out.

33:34.153 --> 33:35.830
What do you want?

33:35.831 --> 33:38.634
I am so sorry, Sheriff.

33:38.635 --> 33:40.255
Dean's just been a little cranky,

33:40.256 --> 33:41.256
well, since.

33:42.925 --> 33:43.758
It's okay.

33:43.759 --> 33:45.151
I just wanna ask your son if he knows

33:45.152 --> 33:46.629
of anyone that Frank
might've been seein'

33:46.630 --> 33:47.898
down at Fort Myers.

33:47.899 --> 33:49.491
Fort Myers?

33:49.492 --> 33:51.921
Why would anyone wanna
go to that shit-hole?

33:51.922 --> 33:53.217
That's what we wanna know.

33:53.218 --> 33:54.791
The Highway Patrol found
his truck down there

33:54.792 --> 33:56.045
this mornin'.

33:56.046 --> 33:58.918
That asshole ditched
me to go to Fort Myers?

33:58.919 --> 34:00.072
Found his truck in the parking lot

34:00.073 --> 34:02.673
near the train station.

34:02.674 --> 34:05.420
He didn't buy any tickets
in the last two weeks.

34:05.421 --> 34:07.506
We're wonderin' if maybe
you know who did.

34:07.507 --> 34:08.589
Huh?

34:08.590 --> 34:10.090
Officer Ambrose.

34:12.829 --> 34:14.705
You know who he's been seein'?

34:14.706 --> 34:17.310
Well, I heard he was
bangin' Shari Wilson.

34:17.311 --> 34:19.355
Wrong answer.

34:19.356 --> 34:21.047
She's accounted for.

34:21.049 --> 34:21.882
Try again.

34:23.181 --> 34:26.070
Then I don't know of anyone else.

34:26.071 --> 34:27.051
Are you sure about that?

34:27.052 --> 34:29.438
I mean, you two are joined at the head.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.560
You'd have to know who else he's seein'.

34:31.561 --> 34:33.335
Well, I don't know
what he had for breakfast

34:33.337 --> 34:34.757
that mornin', either.

34:34.759 --> 34:37.176
I guess we weren't as good
of friends as you thought.

34:37.177 --> 34:40.217
Dean, are you sure
you don't know anything?

34:40.219 --> 34:42.284
Really, Ma, I have no idea.

34:42.284 --> 34:44.161
I was just his cover story.

34:44.161 --> 34:45.498
He'd drop me off somewhere

34:45.498 --> 34:46.708
and then go visit Shari and...

34:46.708 --> 34:49.353
He wasn't with Shari.

34:49.355 --> 34:51.866
Then whoever he was seeing.

34:51.867 --> 34:55.181
Anyway, he'd come pick
me up before going home

34:55.183 --> 34:57.461
so Karla would think I was
with him the whole time.

34:57.462 --> 34:58.655
Honest.

34:58.656 --> 35:01.453
So, that's why you
were in the forest with him?

35:01.454 --> 35:03.348
That's all you were, some sort of

35:03.349 --> 35:04.840
cover story for your buddy?

35:04.841 --> 35:07.671
I just told you, I wasn't his buddy.

35:07.672 --> 35:09.692
He wanted people to think that I was.

35:09.693 --> 35:11.724
So why'd you go along with it.

35:11.725 --> 35:12.558
Well,

35:14.216 --> 35:16.402
we'd stop at the liquor store first.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.122
You're pathetic.

35:22.123 --> 35:23.313
Yeah?
Yeah.

35:23.314 --> 35:24.983
Well some of us don't
make those big paychecks

35:24.984 --> 35:26.576
like cops do,

35:26.577 --> 35:27.413
fuckwad!

35:27.414 --> 35:29.330
Dean, that is enough.

35:31.279 --> 35:33.114
I'm outta here.

35:33.115 --> 35:35.052
Dean, Mr. Reading
will be here soon.

35:35.053 --> 35:37.886
Well he can blow me, too.

35:41.766 --> 35:43.099
I am so sorry.

35:44.199 --> 35:46.900
Dean's just been stressed lately.

35:46.901 --> 35:48.424
It's okay, Louise.

35:48.425 --> 35:50.756
I'm gettin' ready to go
over to Mr. Reading's now.

35:50.757 --> 35:51.590
Would you like for me to see

35:51.591 --> 35:53.259
if he can postpone his visit with you?

35:53.260 --> 35:55.364
No, that's all right.

35:55.365 --> 35:57.894
I'm sure Dean will be back soon.

35:57.895 --> 35:58.895
All right.

35:59.843 --> 36:02.997
So how do you know he
wasn't with Shari Wilson?

36:02.998 --> 36:04.962
I talked to her.

36:04.963 --> 36:07.153
She's probably the best
witness that we've got.

36:07.154 --> 36:09.599
I mean, is that guy ever sober?

36:09.600 --> 36:10.696
Not often.

36:10.697 --> 36:12.699
He gets that from his daddy.

36:12.700 --> 36:13.825
I could smell it on him.

36:13.826 --> 36:15.826
Just about made me sick.

36:19.619 --> 36:22.322
I want you to out to the Reserve today.

36:22.323 --> 36:25.628
See if they've seen any
bears around there lately.

36:25.629 --> 36:27.763
Can I take the cruiser?

36:27.764 --> 36:29.847
It's still in the shop.

36:31.590 --> 36:34.221
Yeah, well I'm sendin'
you my gas receipts.

36:34.222 --> 36:35.261
If I'm payin' for your gas,

36:35.262 --> 36:37.151
you go straight there and back.

36:37.152 --> 36:39.569
No detours at Shari Wilson's.

36:42.756 --> 36:44.490
Yeah.

36:44.491 --> 36:45.328
Oh.

36:52.476 --> 36:53.835
Ow!

36:53.836 --> 36:54.669
Damn it!

36:56.235 --> 36:58.268
This isn't working for me, Joey.

36:58.269 --> 37:00.352
Oh, what are you doin'?

37:02.268 --> 37:04.742
There's just not enough room in here, I.

37:04.743 --> 37:06.391
The fucking steering wheel.

37:06.392 --> 37:08.297
Why can't we just go back to your place?

37:08.298 --> 37:09.131
We can't.

37:09.132 --> 37:11.182
The sheriff gave me a chore to do.

37:11.183 --> 37:12.988
If he sees my truck at my place,

37:12.989 --> 37:14.406
he'll have a fit.

37:15.506 --> 37:16.745
Why would he be going all the way out

37:16.746 --> 37:18.733
to your house today?

37:18.734 --> 37:21.365
He's there to see your tenant.

37:21.366 --> 37:23.201
He's going over to see Mr. Reading?

37:23.202 --> 37:24.437
Why?

37:24.438 --> 37:25.547
Probably gonna warn the poor guy

37:25.548 --> 37:27.452
of what a drunk Dean Clout is gonna be

37:27.453 --> 37:29.785
for his interview.

37:29.786 --> 37:31.548
What kind of interview?

37:31.549 --> 37:34.239
Why would anyone wanna
hire someone like Dean?

37:34.240 --> 37:35.616
Damn it, Shari.

37:35.617 --> 37:38.562
Doesn't your mother check
up on any of her renters?

37:38.563 --> 37:39.867
He's the special investigator

37:39.868 --> 37:42.528
here for the bear attacks.

37:42.529 --> 37:45.941
So, he's going
over to see Dean today?

37:45.942 --> 37:47.448
Yeah.

37:47.449 --> 37:50.194
And I'm headin' out to the Reserve.

37:50.195 --> 37:52.112
You wanna come with me?

37:53.266 --> 37:55.771
Maybe we can check out
one of those cabins?

37:55.772 --> 37:58.132
Actually, I promised Mom I'd do laundry

37:58.133 --> 38:00.392
for her this afternoon.

38:00.393 --> 38:01.487
You know Mom.

38:01.488 --> 38:03.666
I'll never hear the
end of it if I don't.

38:06.813 --> 38:09.126
Stupid son of a bitch.

38:09.127 --> 38:11.875
Well, at least
now you know he's alive.

38:11.876 --> 38:12.956
Yeah, he's probably livin' it up

38:12.957 --> 38:16.199
and laughin' about how
he stuck it to me.

38:16.200 --> 38:18.771
That was a pretty shitty thing to do.

38:18.772 --> 38:19.909
You want a drink?

38:19.910 --> 38:21.493
I'll have a beer.

38:32.127 --> 38:33.337
I still have some whiskey left.

38:33.338 --> 38:34.487
You want that?

38:34.488 --> 38:36.571
No, just a beer.

38:48.863 --> 38:51.106
You feelin' okay, honey?

38:51.107 --> 38:52.202
Yeah, it's just been a while

38:52.203 --> 38:53.328
since I had one of those.

38:53.329 --> 38:55.871
I forgot how bitter it tastes.

38:55.872 --> 38:56.705
So, um,

38:57.650 --> 38:59.337
when you movin' in?

38:59.338 --> 39:00.722
Moving in, me?

39:00.723 --> 39:02.607
Well, yeah, I can't
afford to keep this place

39:02.608 --> 39:03.875
by myself.

39:03.876 --> 39:05.244
And I can?

39:05.245 --> 39:06.819
You can get a job, can't you?

39:08.842 --> 39:10.035
I'm serious.

39:10.036 --> 39:11.986
Yeah, I think you are.

39:11.987 --> 39:12.909
But I can't.

39:12.910 --> 39:14.347
What do you mean you can't get a job?

39:14.348 --> 39:16.009
You're not a fucking cripple.

39:16.010 --> 39:17.857
I mean, I can't just move in with you.

39:17.858 --> 39:19.052
And why not?

39:19.053 --> 39:20.389
Your husband disappears without

39:20.390 --> 39:22.521
saying a fucking word to anyone,

39:22.522 --> 39:24.570
and then I move in two weeks later?

39:24.571 --> 39:25.749
How's that gonna look?

39:25.750 --> 39:28.667
I don't give a shit how it looks.

39:29.859 --> 39:31.397
Well then, how's it
gonna look to the cops

39:31.398 --> 39:36.062
who are just itching to
throw my ass in a cell, hmm?

39:36.063 --> 39:38.762
We need to stay off the
radar for a little bit, baby.

39:38.763 --> 39:40.013
For how long?

39:41.012 --> 39:44.697
I don't know, a couple months, at least.

39:44.698 --> 39:46.915
Hey, do you think Frank told anyone?

39:46.916 --> 39:49.883
I mean, when he found out about us.

39:49.884 --> 39:50.880
No.

39:50.881 --> 39:53.827
We would've heard if he had had.

39:57.908 --> 39:59.846
So Ronald was your grandson?

39:59.847 --> 40:00.680
Yes.

40:01.683 --> 40:03.188
We were looking after him while Kim

40:03.189 --> 40:07.258
went on a trip with some
old friends form school.

40:07.259 --> 40:11.154
It's hard on her being a
single parent, you know?

40:11.155 --> 40:13.738
She just needed a little break.

40:14.695 --> 40:16.616
I understand.

40:16.617 --> 40:17.867
Don't we all?

40:19.686 --> 40:21.707
Now, your daughter's still here?

40:21.708 --> 40:22.541
No.

40:23.443 --> 40:25.642
She had a terrible fight
with her ex-husband

40:25.643 --> 40:26.807
at the funeral.

40:26.808 --> 40:28.745
She's gone back up to Mobile.

40:28.746 --> 40:30.127
And he lives here in town?

40:30.128 --> 40:30.961
No.

40:31.805 --> 40:35.387
He's over in Lauderdale, I think.

40:35.388 --> 40:36.638
He's remarried.

40:38.401 --> 40:41.802
Do you know when your son's coming back?

40:41.803 --> 40:44.252
I told him you were coming.

40:44.253 --> 40:46.877
He must've just lost track of time.

40:46.878 --> 40:49.461
I really need to talk to him.

40:50.380 --> 40:53.411
Maybe I can help.

40:53.412 --> 40:56.312
The sheriff is an old friend of mine.

40:56.313 --> 40:59.083
He didn't hold back any
of the details on me.

40:59.084 --> 41:01.757
I can't expect you
to wanna talk about it.

41:01.758 --> 41:04.589
This research you're doing,

41:04.590 --> 41:06.757
it's to save lives, right?

41:07.689 --> 41:10.404
Trying to figure out
what causes the attacks?

41:10.405 --> 41:11.238
Yes.

41:17.406 --> 41:19.450
I don't want anyone else to suffer

41:19.451 --> 41:21.201
like my grandson did.

41:22.789 --> 41:25.956
He was alive for most of it, you know?

41:26.972 --> 41:28.779
Can you imagine

41:28.780 --> 41:29.863
how terrible?

41:30.885 --> 41:32.506
Yes.

41:32.507 --> 41:33.599
I know.

42:40.371 --> 42:41.821
You must be pretty lonely up here

42:41.822 --> 42:44.239
all by yourself, Mr. Reading.

42:55.145 --> 42:55.978
Oh my God.

43:04.520 --> 43:06.192
What took you so long?

43:06.193 --> 43:07.451
I've been scared to
death that he'd come back

43:07.452 --> 43:08.478
before you got here.

43:08.479 --> 43:09.628
What are ya doin'?

43:09.629 --> 43:12.109
I, uh, the washin'
machine's broken at the house

43:12.110 --> 43:13.844
and I figured since
he's right next door.

43:13.845 --> 43:14.808
It's okay, sweetheart.

43:14.809 --> 43:17.009
Now are you sure it's his cap in there?

43:17.010 --> 43:18.037
Of course I'm sure.

43:18.038 --> 43:19.362
Frank wore that hat all the time.

43:19.363 --> 43:21.394
Lots of guys wear hats, Shari.

43:21.395 --> 43:22.645
Go in and see for yourself.

43:22.646 --> 43:23.868
It's on the dresser.

43:23.869 --> 43:24.780
On the dresser?

43:24.780 --> 43:25.775
In the bedroom?

43:25.776 --> 43:28.078
Yes, and it's all covered in blood!

43:28.079 --> 43:29.829
Just stay there and
keep an eye out for him.

43:29.830 --> 43:31.223
Just stay there!

43:31.224 --> 43:32.872
Hurry!

44:06.234 --> 44:08.662
What have we been up to,

44:08.663 --> 44:10.426
Mr. Reading?

45:01.967 --> 45:03.276
Did you see it?

45:03.277 --> 45:04.110
Yeah.

45:05.238 --> 45:08.071
You might wanna get dressed
before someone sees you.

45:08.072 --> 45:10.299
Are you gonna call the station?

45:10.300 --> 45:12.619
You didn't call them already?

45:12.620 --> 45:14.113
No.

45:14.114 --> 45:17.086
I wanted you to be the
one to come out here

45:17.087 --> 45:18.837
so you'd be the hero.

45:20.704 --> 45:21.704
Good girl.

45:34.514 --> 45:35.681
Fucking whore.

46:30.652 --> 46:32.020
Actually, they're very timid,

46:32.021 --> 46:32.875
so I don't think she has anything

46:32.876 --> 46:34.056
to be concerned about.

46:34.057 --> 46:35.344
Well that's a relief.

46:35.345 --> 46:38.209
Ellen is worried sick
about catching rabies.

46:38.210 --> 46:39.671
Some people have bats in their attic

46:39.672 --> 46:42.005
and they never even know it.

46:52.302 --> 46:54.576
Why the fuck are you still here?

46:54.577 --> 46:56.722
You should've been gone by now.

46:56.723 --> 46:57.744
Where have you been?

46:57.745 --> 47:00.376
We have been waiting for you for hours.

47:00.377 --> 47:01.943
I know.

47:01.944 --> 47:06.111
He should've given up waitin'.

47:07.489 --> 47:09.607
I am so sorry, Mr. Reading.

47:09.608 --> 47:12.212
I have never seen him this bad before.

47:12.213 --> 47:14.317
Why don't I go have a talk with him?

47:14.318 --> 47:17.019
I don't know
if he's in any condition.

47:17.020 --> 47:17.853
I think he's coherent enough

47:17.854 --> 47:20.520
to hear what I have to tell him.

47:33.896 --> 47:36.589
What the fuck are you doin' here?

47:36.590 --> 47:39.986
Dean, I need
you to listen to me.

47:39.987 --> 47:41.591
Go fuck yourself.

47:41.592 --> 47:43.013
Cut it out, Dean.

47:43.014 --> 47:45.435
You didn't drink that much tonight.

47:45.436 --> 47:46.269
I bet you're not even drinkin'

47:46.270 --> 47:48.478
the hard stuff anymore.

47:48.479 --> 47:50.669
You don't know.

47:50.670 --> 47:53.587
I know what you're going through.

47:54.709 --> 47:57.325
You don't know shit.

47:57.326 --> 47:59.787
I know you've been a
cranky little boy lately.

47:59.788 --> 48:02.514
Your mother told me that much.

48:02.515 --> 48:04.464
Get the fuck outta here.

48:04.465 --> 48:05.675
And I know you walked
away from somethin'

48:05.676 --> 48:08.090
that tore your nephew in half.

48:08.091 --> 48:10.068
Are you deaf or somethin'?

48:10.069 --> 48:11.905
And, as sure as I'm here,

48:11.906 --> 48:13.620
all this guilt you're feeling

48:13.621 --> 48:15.099
is nothing compared to
what's in store for you

48:15.100 --> 48:17.256
if you don't listen to
what I have to say.

48:17.257 --> 48:19.284
What do you want from me?

48:19.285 --> 48:21.317
I want you to come with me.

48:21.318 --> 48:22.969
Why would I do that?

48:22.970 --> 48:25.399
Because I know
how to control it.

48:25.400 --> 48:26.233
Control it?

48:26.234 --> 48:27.805
What are you, from AA or something?

48:27.806 --> 48:30.365
Dean, the animal that attacked you

48:30.366 --> 48:33.861
has a disease, and it has infected you.

48:33.862 --> 48:35.428
I ain't got no diseases.

48:35.429 --> 48:36.879
Everything's fine.

48:36.880 --> 48:39.325
The doctors can't even
believe how fine I am.

48:39.326 --> 48:40.305
I know.

48:40.306 --> 48:42.137
It just hasn't matured yet.

48:42.138 --> 48:44.075
But you do have all the symptoms.

48:44.076 --> 48:45.395
Symptoms.

48:45.396 --> 48:49.008
There is the increased
irritability and anxiety,

48:49.009 --> 48:50.426
wild mood shifts,

48:51.500 --> 48:53.783
short spells of feelin' disoriented,

48:53.784 --> 48:55.311
restlessness,

48:55.312 --> 48:57.131
heavy sweating.

48:57.132 --> 48:59.549
So, it's called alcoholism.

49:01.923 --> 49:04.198
And then there's the
accelerated metabolism,

49:04.199 --> 49:07.343
the hyperactive immune system.

49:07.344 --> 49:08.720
You're probably experiencing
a higher tolerance

49:08.721 --> 49:09.804
of pain, too.

49:11.224 --> 49:13.515
I bet you're even horny
as a jackrabbit now.

49:13.516 --> 49:15.346
Shit, are you comin' on to me?

49:15.347 --> 49:17.127
You're one of them fags, ain't ya?

49:17.128 --> 49:19.659
You're definitely not my type.

49:19.660 --> 49:22.243
Just get the fuck outta here.

49:23.879 --> 49:25.202
You just let my words sink into

49:25.203 --> 49:27.258
that thick skull of yours.

49:27.259 --> 49:28.676
We'll talk again.

49:29.559 --> 49:31.447
Don't count on it, faggot.

50:18.123 --> 50:20.644
Damn it, Mom, will
you shut up these damn eggs?

50:20.645 --> 50:22.452
What are you doing?

50:22.453 --> 50:23.590
Are you all right?

50:23.591 --> 50:25.565
Let me get you a towel.

50:25.566 --> 50:26.845
Dean, where are you going?

50:35.545 --> 50:37.335
What the fuck is wrong with me?

50:57.577 --> 50:58.410
Hello?

51:02.847 --> 51:05.854
Well, just come on in and
make yourself at home.

51:05.855 --> 51:07.772
Okay, you were right.

51:08.868 --> 51:11.343
Some really weird shit's
been going on lately.

51:11.344 --> 51:13.108
What's happening to me?

51:13.109 --> 51:15.240
Your body chemistry is changing.

51:15.241 --> 51:16.363
Yeah, I got that.

51:16.364 --> 51:18.679
I have a disease or something,

51:18.680 --> 51:20.605
but what is it?

51:20.606 --> 51:22.169
It's hard to explain.

51:22.170 --> 51:23.876
That thing that attacked you,

51:23.877 --> 51:25.964
it left a little bit of
itself inside of you.

51:25.965 --> 51:28.382
That's what's causing this to happen.

51:28.383 --> 51:30.117
But what is happening?

51:30.118 --> 51:33.433
You're turning into it,
and you don't have much time.

51:33.434 --> 51:35.737
It, what the hell is it?

51:35.738 --> 51:37.200
I don't know exactly.

51:37.201 --> 51:38.784
I've never seen it.

51:39.676 --> 51:40.841
Fuckin' knew it.

51:40.842 --> 51:42.348
You don't know shit about this!

51:42.349 --> 51:43.600
I know right now
everyone around you

51:43.601 --> 51:44.709
is in danger.

51:44.710 --> 51:46.688
In danger of what, me?

51:46.689 --> 51:47.798
Is this thing contagious?

51:47.799 --> 51:48.805
It's very contagious,

51:48.806 --> 51:50.569
and almost always fatal.

51:50.570 --> 51:51.650
Just because you survived

51:51.651 --> 51:53.145
doesn't mean you're lucky.

51:53.146 --> 51:55.803
You need to isolate
yourself from everyone.

51:55.804 --> 51:57.894
You won't have any control
left when it peaks.

51:57.895 --> 51:59.783
That's why ya have to plan for it.

51:59.784 --> 52:01.963
But how the fuck
do you plan for a disease?

52:01.964 --> 52:03.951
It peaks every 28 days.

52:03.952 --> 52:05.205
It's on a lunar cycle.

52:05.206 --> 52:06.941
What?

52:06.942 --> 52:08.034
You feel it start to take hold

52:08.035 --> 52:09.168
for a couple of weeks,

52:09.169 --> 52:10.221
and then it blows up on days

52:10.222 --> 52:11.532
when there's a full moon.

52:11.533 --> 52:13.780
Wait, you're tellin' me

52:13.781 --> 52:16.226
that I'm turnin' into
a werewolf, is that it?

52:16.227 --> 52:17.648
I suppose you could call it that.

52:20.294 --> 52:21.829
Ah, you gotta be shittin' me, man.

52:21.830 --> 52:23.678
You really had me goin' there.

52:23.679 --> 52:25.015
Dean, if you don't lock yourself up,

52:25.016 --> 52:27.560
you're gonna kill someone.

52:27.561 --> 52:28.997
Wait.
It's not gonna be pretty.

52:28.998 --> 52:30.818
You're serious, aren't you?

52:30.819 --> 52:31.899
I can help.

52:31.900 --> 52:33.548
Oh, man, you're the one
who needs help, buddy.

52:33.549 --> 52:36.494
Do you even realize how
batshit that sounds?

52:36.495 --> 52:37.632
Dean, if you're not gonna give yourself,

52:37.633 --> 52:39.522
at least send your mother away.

52:39.523 --> 52:41.940
Oh, you're good, send me mother away.

52:41.941 --> 52:43.474
Can we put her on a rocket ship to Mars

52:43.475 --> 52:45.425
while I turn into a werewolf?

52:45.426 --> 52:46.917
When you change, you're not gonna stop

52:46.918 --> 52:48.994
until you eat something
that smells good to you,

52:48.995 --> 52:51.899
and that's gonna be the
first person you see.

52:51.900 --> 52:55.227
There are a lot of good retirement
communities in the city.

52:55.228 --> 52:57.458
You know, you really are
out of your fuckin' mind.

52:57.459 --> 52:59.162
You just stay the hell
away from us, understand?

52:59.163 --> 53:00.717
Dean, I'm just...
If I see you again,

53:00.718 --> 53:02.718
I'm gonna kick your ass.

53:14.270 --> 53:16.190
No one's heard from Shari
in almost a week, Karla,

53:16.191 --> 53:17.710
and your name keeps comin' up

53:17.711 --> 53:20.239
in conversation, a lot.

53:20.240 --> 53:23.342
Now, I heard you threatened
her after your husband left.

53:23.343 --> 53:24.979
I didn't threaten her.

53:24.980 --> 53:28.166
All I did was call and
ask if Frank was with her.

53:28.167 --> 53:30.632
She's the one that got all angry.

53:30.633 --> 53:32.241
How do you mean?

53:32.242 --> 53:34.090
Look, I'm not the only one the bastard

53:34.091 --> 53:35.341
skipped out on.

53:36.537 --> 53:38.613
The only difference is,
she's got other guys

53:38.614 --> 53:40.718
to fall back on.

53:40.719 --> 53:42.067
Can you give me some names?

53:42.068 --> 53:44.485
Grab a phone book, Sheriff.

53:45.936 --> 53:50.023
Karla, I need to know of
everyone she's been seein'.

53:50.024 --> 53:50.857
Well, let's see.

53:50.858 --> 53:53.565
There's, uh, Pete at the hardware store.

53:53.566 --> 53:56.209
The grill cook from the Dockside.

53:56.210 --> 53:57.519
What's his name?

53:57.520 --> 53:59.181
Rob, I think.

53:59.182 --> 54:01.349
Uh, oh, your new pet Joey.

54:02.839 --> 54:06.821
And that guy with the weird
bald spot on his head.

54:06.822 --> 54:09.295
You know, the one over on Mayland.

54:09.296 --> 54:10.815
And that's it?

54:10.816 --> 54:12.209
I don't know.

54:12.210 --> 54:14.129
I heard she was hitting on Ryan Darby

54:14.130 --> 54:16.532
over the 4th of July weekend.

54:16.533 --> 54:18.113
Oh, wait, and there was that guy

54:18.114 --> 54:21.193
that she's been seeing
in my AA meeting, too.

54:21.194 --> 54:22.027
Okay.

54:22.028 --> 54:24.326
Well, uh, what's his name?

54:24.327 --> 54:25.196
I don't know.

54:25.197 --> 54:27.113
I mean, it's anonymous.

54:28.594 --> 54:29.898
I'm just sayin'.

54:29.899 --> 54:31.636
She's probably fuckin' the guy

54:31.637 --> 54:34.637
that's rentin' her mom's place, too.

54:36.205 --> 54:37.739
Okay.

54:37.740 --> 54:38.975
If you think of anyone else,

54:38.976 --> 54:40.869
just give me a call, please.

54:40.870 --> 54:42.062
Sure.

54:42.063 --> 54:43.941
And I'm gonna need your new address

54:43.942 --> 54:45.204
after you get moved.

54:45.205 --> 54:46.754
I'll, uh, be stayin' at the Reserve

54:46.755 --> 54:49.127
until somethin' better comes along.

54:49.128 --> 54:51.576
At the campgrounds?

54:51.577 --> 54:54.107
Yeah, my old man's a ranger up there.

54:54.108 --> 54:56.541
He's got her set up in
one of our best cabins.

54:56.542 --> 54:57.375
Yeah.

54:57.376 --> 54:59.227
Cheaper than a hotel with, uh,

54:59.228 --> 55:00.811
out all the luxury.

55:52.794 --> 55:55.014
You're runnin' out of time, Dean.

55:55.015 --> 55:56.834
Just look at the moon tonight.

55:56.835 --> 55:57.952
Get the fuck outta here.

55:57.953 --> 55:59.423
I told you, I'm not listening to anymore

55:59.424 --> 56:01.272
of your howling at the moon bullshit.

56:01.273 --> 56:03.560
The virus runs
on a 28-day cycle,

56:03.561 --> 56:04.970
so the moon is a good gauge,

56:04.971 --> 56:06.290
give or take a day.

56:06.291 --> 56:09.135
It's quite natural, given
a woman's cycle is 28 days.

56:09.136 --> 56:09.969
Not to mention...

56:09.970 --> 56:11.467
You don't know when to quit, do you?

56:11.468 --> 56:12.975
I've got a place you can go.

56:12.976 --> 56:14.356
I can help you get through this.

56:14.357 --> 56:16.689
Do you even realize how
fucked up that sounds?

56:16.690 --> 56:18.139
At least get
your mother outta here.

56:18.140 --> 56:19.163
Not happening.

56:19.164 --> 56:20.144
Now get the hell outta here.

56:20.145 --> 56:21.325
I'm not warning you again!

56:26.546 --> 56:28.195
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

56:28.196 --> 56:31.779
Just get out of here,
you fuckin' psycho.

56:47.562 --> 56:50.888
Can I do something for you, Officer?

56:50.889 --> 56:53.507
I just wanted to make
sure you got home all right.

56:53.508 --> 56:56.841
I hear there are monsters lurking about.

57:21.004 --> 57:21.837
Shit.

57:40.120 --> 57:43.120
Where are you going, Kyle Reading?

57:44.378 --> 57:46.378
Or is it Jackson Verrel?

57:47.478 --> 57:49.156
Naw, it couldn't be Jackson Verrel.

57:49.157 --> 57:51.175
He's been dead for the last two years.

57:51.176 --> 57:53.223
Maybe it's Daniel Yates,

57:53.224 --> 57:55.909
wanted for murder in Ohio.

57:55.910 --> 57:57.405
Or, who is that?

57:57.406 --> 57:58.798
Bryan Ospen?

57:58.799 --> 58:00.960
Broke out of jail after
keepin' a young lady

58:00.961 --> 58:03.462
trapped in his basement.

58:03.463 --> 58:05.580
You're a difficult son of
a bitch to keep track of,

58:05.581 --> 58:07.081
but you know what?

58:08.072 --> 58:09.863
Lucky thing I got a buddy in Tampa

58:09.864 --> 58:12.364
who's a pro at lifting prints.

58:17.644 --> 58:19.134
You know,

58:19.135 --> 58:23.302
Shari told me that you
said you were a family man.

58:25.836 --> 58:29.002
I don't seem to see any
kids around here with you.

58:29.003 --> 58:30.199
I had a family.

58:30.200 --> 58:32.007
Oh, I'm sure you did.

58:32.008 --> 58:35.220
Or maybe it was Vince Edgemont.

58:35.221 --> 58:36.966
Dead family.

58:39.261 --> 58:40.894
Yeah, well, I'm guessin' that you

58:40.895 --> 58:43.511
probably told her that
just to keep that slut

58:43.512 --> 58:45.262
out of your way here.

58:46.385 --> 58:48.363
Don't you worry,

58:48.364 --> 58:50.650
she won't be bothering you anymore.

58:50.651 --> 58:51.549
I just called the sheriff.

58:51.550 --> 58:53.865
He's on his way here now.

58:53.866 --> 58:55.486
No.

58:55.487 --> 58:56.737
No, you didn't.

58:58.547 --> 59:00.265
You don't wanna spend any time

59:00.266 --> 59:03.109
waitin' in our comfy
little holding cell.

59:03.110 --> 59:04.121
I didn't kill her.

59:04.122 --> 59:06.372
Oh, I'm sure you did not.

59:07.222 --> 59:09.127
But you know what?

59:09.128 --> 59:12.313
Who do you think ole
Boris is gonna listen to?

59:12.314 --> 59:13.981
His trusty sidekick,

59:14.931 --> 59:15.764
or some

59:17.073 --> 59:19.406
name-changing wacko fugitive

59:22.326 --> 59:24.698
with werewolves on the brain.

59:24.699 --> 59:26.282
What do you want?

59:30.180 --> 59:31.597
What do I want?

59:34.934 --> 59:39.728
I just wanna have a little
fun, you know?

59:39.729 --> 59:40.562
Yeah, I

59:41.487 --> 59:43.764
kinda screwed up last
month a little bit,

59:43.765 --> 59:45.872
thought I was gonna have to transfer.

59:45.873 --> 59:46.706
Again.

59:47.876 --> 59:52.158
But, you know, can you
imagine how happy I am

59:52.159 --> 59:54.727
to find someone like you

59:54.728 --> 59:57.575
who I can just pin everything on.

59:57.576 --> 59:59.026
Yeah.

59:59.027 --> 59:59.860
Now look,

01:00:01.203 --> 01:00:03.870
if you wanna take a swing at me.

01:00:04.874 --> 01:00:08.067
Yeah.

01:00:08.068 --> 01:00:09.235
Tell you what,

01:00:10.762 --> 01:00:12.439
you stick around as long as you need to

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:16.023
to finish up that little
bear attack story.

01:00:17.247 --> 01:00:19.080
I promise you, though,

01:00:21.456 --> 01:00:25.623
everything's going to go right
back to normal around here.

01:00:27.886 --> 01:00:30.053
Just as soon as you leave.

01:00:50.304 --> 01:00:51.310
Mail's in, Ma.

01:00:51.311 --> 01:00:52.464
Thank you.

01:00:52.465 --> 01:00:53.813
Would you please call
in the prescription

01:00:53.814 --> 01:00:55.393
for my sleeping pills?

01:00:55.394 --> 01:00:56.829
I only have a few left.

01:00:56.830 --> 01:00:58.497
Yeah, sure.

01:01:00.529 --> 01:01:01.906
You might wanna think about taking some

01:01:01.907 --> 01:01:02.990
tonight, too.

01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:06.501
You look like a raccoon with
those bags under your eyes.

01:01:13.792 --> 01:01:15.694
Dean, what's this all about?

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:27.723
Dean, what the hell is this?

01:01:30.448 --> 01:01:32.198
I found that in this!

01:01:33.062 --> 01:01:36.219
Do you think you can kick
me out of my own home?

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:37.518
No, Ma, I don't even know what...

01:01:37.519 --> 01:01:40.074
Don't you pull that
innocence crap on me.

01:01:40.075 --> 01:01:41.540
You think you can ship me off

01:01:41.541 --> 01:01:43.873
and move that woman in here.

01:01:43.874 --> 01:01:45.381
You think that that tramp

01:01:45.382 --> 01:01:46.945
that you've been sneakin'
off to see at night

01:01:46.946 --> 01:01:48.174
is gonna take care of you?

01:01:48.175 --> 01:01:50.663
Huh, she can't even keep her own house,

01:01:50.664 --> 01:01:52.430
which costs a hell of
a lot less to maintain

01:01:52.431 --> 01:01:54.393
than this house, boy.

01:01:54.394 --> 01:01:55.400
Stop it, Ma.

01:01:55.401 --> 01:01:56.243
I'm warning you.

01:01:56.244 --> 01:01:57.493
You're warning me?

01:01:57.494 --> 01:01:59.212
I am warning you.

01:01:59.213 --> 01:02:01.959
I have had it up to here
with your slummin' around

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:03.506
and your drinkin'!

01:02:03.507 --> 01:02:04.746
If you think you're gonna ship me off

01:02:04.747 --> 01:02:07.497
to some godforsaken nursing home.

01:02:09.453 --> 01:02:11.786
Shut up, you stupid bitch!

01:02:12.627 --> 01:02:16.294
I haven't had a drink
in three fucking days!

01:02:18.941 --> 01:02:20.941
Just leave me alone, Ma.

01:02:23.519 --> 01:02:26.102
Dean, what is wrong with you?

01:02:29.307 --> 01:02:31.881
It's just the DTs, Ma.

01:02:31.882 --> 01:02:34.299
Don't worry about it.

01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:49.092
I wish I knew more,

01:02:49.093 --> 01:02:52.461
but, honestly, I haven't seen
her since that first day.

01:02:52.462 --> 01:02:54.237
I'm sorry to keep
pesterin' you all the time.

01:02:54.238 --> 01:02:56.839
I, I know you're busy with
your research and all.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.865
No problem, really, Sheriff.

01:02:57.866 --> 01:02:59.514
I'm glad you called.

01:02:59.515 --> 01:03:01.608
Seems like the whole
town's been goin' crazy

01:03:01.609 --> 01:03:03.639
ever since that kid got killed.

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.460
I mean, Frank's ran off on his wife,

01:03:05.461 --> 01:03:08.605
and now it looks like
Shari's ran off, too.

01:03:08.606 --> 01:03:10.921
To top it off, I got a phone call

01:03:10.922 --> 01:03:12.087
from Kimberly Clout

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:14.152
tellin' me that Dean went
and beat up his mother

01:03:14.153 --> 01:03:15.318
the other day.

01:03:15.319 --> 01:03:17.252
Is Mrs. Clout all right?

01:03:17.253 --> 01:03:18.772
Yeah, she's okay.

01:03:18.773 --> 01:03:20.193
Always been a tough little lady.

01:03:20.194 --> 01:03:21.844
Of course, she won't press charges,

01:03:21.845 --> 01:03:23.408
and now I'm startin' to think

01:03:23.409 --> 01:03:26.537
Officer Ambrose is
hittin' the bottle, too.

01:03:26.538 --> 01:03:28.771
It's just been a madhouse around here.

01:03:28.772 --> 01:03:30.349
Do you wanna sit down, Sheriff?

01:03:30.350 --> 01:03:31.827
No.

01:03:31.828 --> 01:03:35.144
I don't mean to be
unloadin' all this on ya.

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:36.791
Need to get back over to the station,

01:03:36.792 --> 01:03:40.128
make sure my secretary
hasn't ran off, too.

01:03:40.129 --> 01:03:41.208
Must be hard bein' a sheriff

01:03:41.209 --> 01:03:43.055
in such a small town, huh?

01:03:43.056 --> 01:03:45.249
You know, for 28 years,

01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:47.252
it's been a piece of cake.

01:03:47.253 --> 01:03:50.568
Hell, people don't ever lock
their doors around here.

01:03:50.569 --> 01:03:53.611
I guess it all had to catch up sometime.

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:19.954
What the fuck?

01:04:30.018 --> 01:04:33.520
You just don't know when
to fucking quit, do you?

01:04:33.521 --> 01:04:35.964
Do you know what someone goes through

01:04:35.965 --> 01:04:37.912
when they're being eaten alive?

01:04:37.913 --> 01:04:40.080
No, not this shit again.

01:04:41.099 --> 01:04:43.016
They feel everything.

01:04:44.398 --> 01:04:45.962
Knives

01:04:45.963 --> 01:04:47.630
piercing their flesh

01:04:48.889 --> 01:04:49.722
over

01:04:51.469 --> 01:04:52.719
and over again.

01:04:55.492 --> 01:04:59.632
Some doctors say they go
into shock after a minute,

01:04:59.633 --> 01:05:03.013
but they can still hear
their bones breaking.

01:05:03.014 --> 01:05:05.776
They can still smell the
blood, piss, and shit

01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:08.063
as it pours out of them.

01:05:08.064 --> 01:05:10.753
Leave me the fuck alone.

01:05:10.754 --> 01:05:14.935
I don't want your
mother to go through that.

01:05:14.936 --> 01:05:15.769
Do you?

01:05:18.036 --> 01:05:20.452
I will beat the living shit out of you

01:05:20.453 --> 01:05:24.036
if you don't get off
my property right now.

01:05:27.562 --> 01:05:31.105
I just wanted you to know that.

01:06:35.202 --> 01:06:36.567
I'm sorry.

01:06:36.568 --> 01:06:37.971
It's best you go this way.

01:07:25.557 --> 01:07:27.079
Hey, Sheriff, where we goin'?

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:28.160
Her bedroom's back there.

01:07:28.161 --> 01:07:29.468
All right.

01:07:37.994 --> 01:07:40.231
I'm really sorry
for your loss, Dean.

01:07:40.232 --> 01:07:42.279
Louise was a good woman.

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:43.897
I should've been here.

01:07:43.898 --> 01:07:45.761
Maybe I would've heard her calling.

01:07:45.762 --> 01:07:46.953
You couldn't have know.

01:07:46.954 --> 01:07:49.531
She died in her sleep.

01:07:49.532 --> 01:07:51.921
Where were you last night, Dean?

01:07:51.922 --> 01:07:53.752
Are you actually
accusing me of something?

01:07:53.753 --> 01:07:55.170
No, no, no, no.

01:07:56.710 --> 01:08:00.494
I'm just sayin' a man
who beats up on his mama,

01:08:00.495 --> 01:08:01.463
goes out in the middle of the night

01:08:01.464 --> 01:08:03.470
same night she died,

01:08:03.471 --> 01:08:05.356
sounds a little fishy, that's all.

01:08:05.357 --> 01:08:09.045
Look, I don't think Dean
had anything to do with this.

01:08:09.046 --> 01:08:10.821
Things like this happen.

01:08:10.822 --> 01:08:12.999
It's nobody's fault.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.400
I just went for a fucking
drive to clear my head!

01:08:15.401 --> 01:08:19.069
I haven't been sleeping well, okay?

01:08:19.069 --> 01:08:20.492
Sheriff.

01:08:20.493 --> 01:08:23.160
Can I speak to you for a minute?

01:08:30.265 --> 01:08:32.682
It's okay, Dean, it's okay.

01:08:33.662 --> 01:08:36.462
Is that keepin' ya up at night,

01:08:36.464 --> 01:08:38.854
tryin' to figure out
who you wanna hurt next?

01:08:38.856 --> 01:08:40.529
I just gave up drinking, okay?

01:08:40.529 --> 01:08:43.964
Hasn't exactly been easy for me.

01:08:43.965 --> 01:08:47.194
Dean, they're gettin'
ready to take her out now.

01:08:47.194 --> 01:08:49.084
You want me to call your sister?

01:08:49.085 --> 01:08:51.216
Yes.

01:08:51.218 --> 01:08:52.752
Thank you.
All right.

01:08:52.754 --> 01:08:54.374
Officer Ambrose.
Sir?

01:08:54.375 --> 01:08:55.785
You can go ahead and head on it,

01:08:55.786 --> 01:08:57.475
and, uh, I'll take it form here.

01:08:57.475 --> 01:08:58.475
All right.

01:08:59.559 --> 01:09:00.392
Dean,

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.577
I'm very sorry for your loss.

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:11.447
Asshole.

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:35.402
Dean!

01:09:35.403 --> 01:09:36.666
Let me in!

01:09:41.421 --> 01:09:42.254
Christ.

01:09:43.367 --> 01:09:45.283
What is wrong with you?

01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:13.290
Leaving so soon?

01:10:14.609 --> 01:10:16.144
Officer Ambrose.

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:17.124
I just wanted to let you know

01:10:17.125 --> 01:10:18.346
that Kimberly Clout was in town

01:10:18.347 --> 01:10:19.769
to bury her mother.

01:10:19.770 --> 01:10:20.611
You know, since you been payin'

01:10:20.612 --> 01:10:22.231
such close attention to Dean.

01:10:22.232 --> 01:10:23.239
What's that to me?

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:25.329
Oh, I thought you'd wanna off her, too.

01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:26.224
You know, to keep her brother

01:10:26.225 --> 01:10:29.115
from eating her tomorrow night.

01:10:29.116 --> 01:10:30.175
Yeah.

01:10:30.176 --> 01:10:31.760
I know you're kinda crazy.

01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:35.925
You really believe that
werewolf bullshit.

01:10:35.926 --> 01:10:37.124
Hey, I was happy to see you

01:10:37.125 --> 01:10:40.032
over at the Clout house the other night.

01:10:40.033 --> 01:10:42.316
Once the, uh, autopsy report comes in,

01:10:42.317 --> 01:10:43.953
we're probably gonna talk to Dean,

01:10:43.954 --> 01:10:45.572
but I'm guessin' he'll have a lot to say

01:10:45.573 --> 01:10:48.504
about you wantin' to
save poor old Louise

01:10:48.505 --> 01:10:50.255
before the full moon.

01:10:51.207 --> 01:10:52.401
Hey, I got an idea.

01:10:52.402 --> 01:10:54.734
Why don't you bring Kimberly out here.

01:10:54.735 --> 01:10:57.948
You and me could both have
some fun with her, huh?

01:10:57.949 --> 01:11:00.435
I think her husband doesn't like her.

01:11:00.436 --> 01:11:03.591
We could probably pin it on him.

01:11:14.177 --> 01:11:15.383
Yes?

01:11:15.384 --> 01:11:16.564
Is Dean here?

01:11:16.565 --> 01:11:18.198
Dean doesn't live here anymore.

01:11:18.199 --> 01:11:19.032
What?

01:11:19.033 --> 01:11:20.149
I kicked his ass out last night

01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:21.998
after he gave me this warm welcome.

01:11:21.999 --> 01:11:23.788
I'm sorry, but I really
need to talk to him.

01:11:23.789 --> 01:11:25.013
Do you know where he went?

01:11:25.014 --> 01:11:26.489
Probably to a bar.

01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:27.323
Well, when he gets back...

01:11:27.324 --> 01:11:28.439
I told him he's never stepping foot

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.621
in this house again.

01:11:29.622 --> 01:11:31.328
I even had Sheriff McKenny escort him

01:11:31.329 --> 01:11:32.533
off the property.

01:11:32.534 --> 01:11:35.111
He's not coming back.

01:13:56.618 --> 01:13:57.618
Mr. Reading?

01:13:58.567 --> 01:14:00.302
It's Kimberly Clout.

01:14:15.677 --> 01:14:16.956
Mr. Reading?

01:14:58.334 --> 01:14:59.642
Mr. Reading?

01:15:02.122 --> 01:15:03.122
Is that you?

01:15:11.066 --> 01:15:12.870
Mr. Reading?

01:15:14.094 --> 01:15:16.499
Mr. Reading, are you in there?

01:15:26.334 --> 01:15:27.334
Mr. Reading?

01:15:28.493 --> 01:15:29.479
Are you okay?

01:15:43.692 --> 01:15:47.531
Mr. Reading, is everything all right?

01:16:01.923 --> 01:16:02.807
Mr. Reading?

01:16:06.554 --> 01:16:07.703
Ow!

01:18:54.611 --> 01:18:55.537
Damn.

01:20:12.362 --> 01:20:13.902
Dean?

01:20:13.903 --> 01:20:15.271
Are you all right?

01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:23.803
Dean.

01:20:26.383 --> 01:20:28.191
What happened to me?

01:20:28.192 --> 01:20:30.249
Just what I told you would happen.

01:20:30.250 --> 01:20:31.673
You ate the first thing
that smelled good to you

01:20:31.674 --> 01:20:33.174
after you changed.

01:20:35.132 --> 01:20:37.305
But I don't remember anything.

01:20:37.306 --> 01:20:38.896
I know.

01:20:38.897 --> 01:20:42.230
It took me a long time to figure it out.

01:20:43.552 --> 01:20:45.135
How did you know?

01:20:45.969 --> 01:20:48.000
I'd been sick for a couple of weeks.

01:20:48.001 --> 01:20:50.501
I thought it was just the flu.

01:20:52.853 --> 01:20:53.686
Until

01:20:55.823 --> 01:20:59.990
I woke up with my wife's
arm next to me on the floor.

01:21:03.067 --> 01:21:06.377
This can't be happening.

01:21:06.378 --> 01:21:08.308
I woke up next to a lot of bodies,

01:21:08.309 --> 01:21:10.571
until I saw the pattern.

01:21:10.572 --> 01:21:13.314
But I know how to distract it now.

01:21:13.315 --> 01:21:16.732
I'm just sorry I didn't
find you in time.

01:21:20.169 --> 01:21:21.586
Please help me.

01:21:22.741 --> 01:21:26.118
I can't live like this anymore.

01:21:26.119 --> 01:21:26.952
No.

01:21:28.694 --> 01:21:30.383
No one should have to live like this.

01:22:20.415 --> 01:22:21.248
Bella?

01:22:23.954 --> 01:22:25.663
Jenny in there with you?

01:22:26.789 --> 01:22:30.926
Come on, you guys were up
all night again, weren't you?

01:22:30.927 --> 01:22:31.760
Come on!

01:22:33.133 --> 01:22:34.383
It's after two.

01:22:54.409 --> 01:22:55.326
Don't move.

01:22:58.060 --> 01:22:59.446
Don't move!

01:22:59.447 --> 01:23:01.462
Look, I'm gonna get help.

01:23:01.463 --> 01:23:03.046
I'm gonna get help.

01:23:05.949 --> 01:23:07.097
No.

01:23:28.874 --> 01:23:29.707
Come in.

01:23:34.598 --> 01:23:37.599
I thought you might like
some fresh towels, Mr. Johnson.

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.252
Is there anything else I can do for you?

01:23:39.253 --> 01:23:40.930
Thank you, Mrs. Potter,
everything's fine.

01:23:40.931 --> 01:23:41.898
I'm very comfortable.

01:23:41.898 --> 01:23:42.731
All right.

01:23:42.732 --> 01:23:45.394
I'll just set these towels
right there for you, then.

01:23:45.395 --> 01:23:47.216
Oh, I see you've been reading

01:23:47.217 --> 01:23:49.671
about that crazy woman in Florida.

01:23:49.672 --> 01:23:50.570
Crazy woman?

01:23:50.571 --> 01:23:53.019
Yeah, it's all over
the news this morning.

01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:56.347
She claims that a monster
broke into her cabin,

01:23:56.348 --> 01:23:59.915
ate her landlord, and
shot her boyfriend.

01:23:59.916 --> 01:24:01.107
Ate her landlord?

01:24:01.108 --> 01:24:03.072
Yeah, can you imagine that?

01:24:03.073 --> 01:24:05.079
Who knows what kind of
drugs she's been on.

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:08.720
And she looked terrible,
all scratched up and all.

01:24:08.721 --> 01:24:12.888
Let me know if I can get you
anything else, Mr. Johnson.

01:24:29.495 --> 01:24:30.729
Patty,

01:24:30.730 --> 01:24:33.460
get me the wagon out here.

01:24:33.461 --> 01:24:34.468
Yeah.

01:24:34.469 --> 01:24:36.886
There are three victims here.

01:24:38.467 --> 01:24:40.550
We've got Kimberly Clout,

01:24:43.018 --> 01:24:47.727
and Officer Joey
Ambrose is here, too.

01:24:47.728 --> 01:24:51.510
And I can't identify
the rest of this body,

01:24:51.511 --> 01:24:55.350
but we can presume Mr.
Reading is dead also.

01:24:55.351 --> 01:24:57.749
And get the Florida Wildlife
Commission on the phone

01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:59.316
and see if they have any idea

01:24:59.317 --> 01:25:02.734
how we can bag this
rogue bear we've got.

01:29:58.203 --> 01:29:59.536
What the fuck?

01:30:02.497 --> 01:30:03.330
Ambrose.

01:30:04.519 --> 01:30:06.710
Dude, you don't get
naked out in the woods.

01:30:06.711 --> 01:30:09.555
There's a, there's a guy
playin' a banjo up there, man.

01:30:09.556 --> 01:30:10.389
Good God!

01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:13.494
It's a little chilly, isn't it?

01:30:13.495 --> 01:30:14.448
We don't play that sort of stuff

01:30:14.448 --> 01:30:15.444
here in the woods.

01:30:15.445 --> 01:30:17.136
You'll get shot!

01:30:17.137 --> 01:30:18.486
It's dangerous out here, man.

01:30:18.487 --> 01:30:20.154
Put your clothes on.
