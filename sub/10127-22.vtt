19:08.934 --> 19:10.900
YOU DON'T EVEN
LIVE IN THE HOUSE
ANYMORE!

19:10.900 --> 19:13.200
IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M ASKING YOU TO
GIVE UP YOUR ROOM.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.600
WAIT A SECOND.
YOU'RE MOVING HER
INTO THE HOUSE?

19:15.600 --> 19:17.033
ALL RIGHT, I CAN'T
DO THIS ANYMORE.

19:17.033 --> 19:19.567
I GOT TO KNOW
WHO'S IN THERE.
COME OUT! NOW!

19:19.567 --> 19:21.767
TOPANGA?

19:21.767 --> 19:23.100
OH, DADDY!

19:23.100 --> 19:25.300
HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO MOM

19:25.300 --> 19:27.033
AND--AND CORY? OH.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.200
I AM SO OUT OF THE LOOP.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.967
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

19:30.967 --> 19:32.467
WELL...

19:32.467 --> 19:33.700
WE'RE CELEBRATING!

19:33.700 --> 19:36.867
WE WERE GOING
TO TELL YOU
TOMORROW, BUT...

19:36.867 --> 19:38.867
WE'RE HAVING A BABY!

19:40.367 --> 19:41.600
YOU'RE HAVING A BABY?

19:41.600 --> 19:42.900
WE'RE HAVING A BABY!

19:42.900 --> 19:44.367
THEY'RE
HAVING A BABY?

19:44.367 --> 19:46.567
I'M GOING
TO BE AN UNCLE!

19:47.767 --> 19:49.600
YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE
HAVING ANOTHER KID?

19:49.600 --> 19:51.133
YES, WE ARE,

19:51.133 --> 19:54.367
AND...WE'RE
THRILLED ABOUT IT.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.767
IS THIS SOMETHING
YOU PLANNED?

19:55.767 --> 19:57.600
NO, CORY,
IT ISN'T, YOU KNOW.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.000
IT'S LIKE
I TOLD YOU BEFORE.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
SOMETIMES THINGS CAN
HAPPEN IN A MINUTE

20:01.000 --> 20:04.934
THAT WILL CHANGE
YOUR LIFE FOREVER.

20:06.734 --> 20:08.200
WE'RE JUST LUCKY
THAT FOR US,

20:08.200 --> 20:11.300
IT CAME AT A TIME
WHEN WE CAN HANDLE IT.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.700
HAVE A NICE NIGHT,
YOU TWO.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.367
WOW.

20:21.367 --> 20:23.000
THEY TRUST US.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
BOY, THIS IS
THE BIGGEST NIGHT
OF OUR LIVES, HUH?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.767
YEAH.

20:27.767 --> 20:29.367
SHALL WE?

21:02.600 --> 21:04.700
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING ELSE

21:04.700 --> 21:06.367
I'D RATHER BE DOING
RIGHT NOW.

21:06.367 --> 21:08.667
ME NEITHER.

21:11.967 --> 21:13.800
