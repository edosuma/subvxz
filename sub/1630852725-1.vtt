WEBVTT

00:23.783 --> 00:25.852
So what do you wanna do?

00:28.587 --> 00:30.690
Thought so.

00:46.906 --> 00:48.273
What's the matter?

00:48.306 --> 00:50.208
Nothing,
just slow down a little bit.

00:50.242 --> 00:51.844
Yeah, right.

00:51.878 --> 00:54.179
Perry, I'm serious.

01:00.953 --> 01:02.955
I really like your car.

01:03.790 --> 01:05.892
Yeah, it was Ricky's.

01:05.925 --> 01:08.628
Oh right, sorry.

01:10.595 --> 01:13.598
He was killed by that bastard
son of a bitch.

01:14.901 --> 01:18.570
I swear to God it was,
worst night of my life.

01:21.674 --> 01:22.942
I'm so sorry.

01:25.544 --> 01:27.947
Yeah, this car is all I have to
remember him by.

01:29.716 --> 01:34.519
Well, maybe, this will make you
feel better.

01:41.359 --> 01:43.029
What was that?

01:43.062 --> 01:45.263
No stop, stop.

01:45.297 --> 01:46.498
I definitely heard something.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.501
It came from over there.

01:51.804 --> 01:53.639
What are you doing?

01:55.574 --> 01:57.275
Hello?

01:57.309 --> 01:59.578
Hey Tyler, is that you, bro?

02:03.716 --> 02:04.784
Perry?

02:07.452 --> 02:09.321
Perry!

02:17.029 --> 02:17.997
Oh, you know what?

02:18.030 --> 02:19.632
This really isn't funny now.

02:19.665 --> 02:20.967
So why don't you come on out?

03:40.713 --> 03:44.884
Listen, I can't hustle
with anyone,

03:44.917 --> 03:46.418
that you're searching for.

03:56.595 --> 03:57.997
Please don't!

05:42.802 --> 05:44.770
So here you are,

05:44.804 --> 05:46.571
what took you so long
to find me?

05:46.604 --> 05:49.141
You bastard.

05:49.175 --> 05:51.944
Your hand shakes,
'cause you have doubt.

05:54.714 --> 05:56.082
You ain't gonna pull
that trigger.

05:56.115 --> 05:57.717
Fuck you.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.719
I don't have any doubt,
you killed my friends.

05:59.752 --> 06:01.087
Your friends got in my way.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.222
And you'd kill me too,
if given the chance.

06:09.328 --> 06:12.765
If I wanted you dead,
we wouldn't be having this

06:12.798 --> 06:15.968
conversation with each other
right now, would we?

06:16.002 --> 06:18.304
You liked killing them.

06:18.337 --> 06:19.839
Well, that should make
no difference

06:19.872 --> 06:24.977
because killing comes easier
for some people,

06:25.011 --> 06:26.212
somebody like me.

06:26.245 --> 06:28.546
It was never supposed
to be like this.

06:28.580 --> 06:31.183
You promised you never
would have done that.

06:31.217 --> 06:33.753
The ring had to be secured

06:33.786 --> 06:36.889
and your fucking friends
stood in the way.

06:36.922 --> 06:37.823
Fuck you!

06:37.857 --> 06:39.925
Stop saying that!

06:39.959 --> 06:41.761
I needed the ring.

06:41.794 --> 06:44.562
And I couldn't have gotten it
without your help, Adrianna.

06:44.596 --> 06:46.866
You will be compensated.

06:46.899 --> 06:48.667
You son of a bitch!

06:49.835 --> 06:51.704
Drop the gun
or I'll throw this

06:51.737 --> 06:54.240
fucking butcher knife
right into your head.

06:54.273 --> 06:55.674
I'm not afraid of you.

06:55.708 --> 06:56.809
Not anymore.

07:00.112 --> 07:01.881
The Chief put a bounty
on your head.

07:01.914 --> 07:03.282
I kill you and bring him
the mask

07:03.315 --> 07:05.251
and I'll have all the money
I ever need.

07:05.284 --> 07:08.287
You really think the Chief is
gonna let you live?

07:08.320 --> 07:10.990
First the ring,
and now the mask.

07:11.023 --> 07:13.859
An evil wind blows through him.

07:16.762 --> 07:19.298
The curse is not buried
in the sand, my child.

07:22.201 --> 07:23.903
I'll take my chances.

07:29.041 --> 07:32.344
Adrianna,
the curse is alive.

07:32.378 --> 07:34.947
An evil wind blows
through you, too.

07:34.980 --> 07:39.718
The weakness of the enemy
creates our strength.

07:39.752 --> 07:42.788
From this strength,
we can thrive.

07:42.822 --> 07:45.357
We can thrive in life,
and in death.

07:46.926 --> 07:51.163
After all, all those before us
are not really dead.

07:51.197 --> 07:53.032
Their hearts can beat
in the souls

07:53.065 --> 07:54.733
that they leave behind.

07:54.767 --> 07:57.903
There is dignity in passing from
this world

07:57.937 --> 07:58.838
into the next.

08:00.106 --> 08:05.711
After all, the tragedy of life
is not death.

08:05.744 --> 08:08.314
The tragedy of life is what we
let die inside of us

08:08.347 --> 08:09.248
while we live.

09:13.179 --> 09:14.780
Hello?

09:26.225 --> 09:27.359
<i>Is it done?</i>

09:27.393 --> 09:28.761
Yes.

09:28.794 --> 09:29.895
<i>Good.</i>

09:29.929 --> 09:32.097
<i>Bring me the mask.</i>

09:32.131 --> 09:33.132
No.

09:33.165 --> 09:35.467
<i>No mask, no reward.</i>

09:35.501 --> 09:37.203
<i>I don't want your money, Chief.</i>

09:37.236 --> 09:38.971
I want nothing
to do with you.

09:39.004 --> 09:41.240
<i>It's too late
for that, my darling.</i>

09:41.273 --> 09:43.008
It's too late
for a lot of things.

09:43.042 --> 09:45.778
Bring me the mask.

09:45.811 --> 09:47.146
<i>The mask is gone.</i>

09:47.179 --> 09:49.348
Buried in the ground,
given back to the earth.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.016
That's the end of all
of this, Chief.

09:51.050 --> 09:53.052
No more mask,
no more killings.

09:53.085 --> 09:55.087
Don't you dare defy me.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.222
It's over.

09:56.255 --> 09:58.123
It's not over,
you little bitch.

09:58.157 --> 10:00.192
It's not over
until I say it's over!

10:00.226 --> 10:02.127
You have to pay for
what you've done.

10:02.161 --> 10:03.062
<i>I will end...</i>

10:40.566 --> 10:41.767
Play it.

10:45.271 --> 10:47.940
<i>Adrianna,
you know who this is.</i>

10:47.973 --> 10:49.241
<i>And you know what I want.</i>

10:49.275 --> 10:50.943
<i>You think you're in control?</i>

10:50.976 --> 10:53.045
<i>You think you call
the shots?</i>

10:53.078 --> 10:55.314
<i>You are out of your depth,
little girl.</i>

10:55.347 --> 10:59.318
<i>Let me make this as simple
for you as possible.</i>

10:59.351 --> 11:02.588
<i>You bring me the mask tonight or
you will not live</i>

11:02.621 --> 11:03.989
<i>to see tomorrow.</i>

11:04.023 --> 11:06.292
<i>Are we fucking clear!</i>

11:06.325 --> 11:10.596
And um,
you're coming to me now?

11:10.630 --> 11:12.131
Now with this.

11:12.164 --> 11:13.565
I'm sorry I just was really
trying to...

11:13.599 --> 11:14.833
What?

11:14.867 --> 11:16.235
You need to think about it?

11:16.268 --> 11:17.436
- I was just...
- Scared?

11:17.469 --> 11:18.904
You scared?

11:18.937 --> 11:20.973
Come on, come on,
she's here now.

11:21.006 --> 11:22.308
Yeah, but we could have been
out there doing...

11:22.341 --> 11:24.209
Zip it.

11:26.245 --> 11:27.913
That bastard's dead.

11:27.946 --> 11:29.915
But then why can't you
find him?

11:29.948 --> 11:32.551
Listen, nobody human could even
survive that, okay.

11:32.584 --> 11:33.952
Let's not be dumb.

11:33.986 --> 11:35.254
What makes you think
he's human?

11:35.287 --> 11:36.355
Oh my God, enough.

11:36.388 --> 11:37.222
This is ridiculous.

11:37.256 --> 11:38.357
Seriously.

11:38.390 --> 11:39.491
Enough.

11:43.028 --> 11:44.496
What's up?

11:51.570 --> 11:52.938
Okay, all right, all right.

11:52.971 --> 11:54.039
- Come on, come on.
- Mom, I wanna go.

11:58.143 --> 12:00.045
That was Tora Carmichael,
wasn't it?

12:00.079 --> 12:01.914
It's not your concern.

12:01.947 --> 12:03.449
She was with Perry
that night,

12:03.482 --> 12:04.550
the night that he went missing.

12:04.583 --> 12:06.118
Everybody's talking about it.

12:06.151 --> 12:07.486
You guys still haven't
found him, have you?

12:07.519 --> 12:09.221
Oh, come on, take it easy.

12:09.254 --> 12:10.956
No, but you know who he is,
right?

12:10.989 --> 12:12.291
Perry is Ricky's little brother.

12:12.324 --> 12:13.525
And you know exactly what
happened to Ricky.

12:13.559 --> 12:15.127
Yeah, we know what happened
to Ricky.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.395
Guess who did the paperwork?

12:16.428 --> 12:17.664
Okay, and so how do you
know that psycho

12:17.697 --> 12:18.964
doesn't have him right now?

12:18.997 --> 12:20.199
Oh my God,
enough of this.

12:20.232 --> 12:21.300
Listen, you need to look
at this, okay.

12:21.333 --> 12:22.968
You see this?
Huh?

12:23.001 --> 12:24.370
Okay, just... all right, stop.

12:24.403 --> 12:26.105
No, you need to look at this,
Adrianna, okay

12:26.138 --> 12:27.239
and get it through your head.

12:27.272 --> 12:28.641
- Damon is dead.
- Okay, okay.

12:28.675 --> 12:29.942
Officer, please just get these
away from me.

12:29.975 --> 12:31.143
Kevin, put it away.

12:31.176 --> 12:32.578
- Put it away.
- Sheriff.

12:32.611 --> 12:34.213
You should've even have
those, come on.

12:34.246 --> 12:35.948
She needs to get this
out of her system.

12:35.981 --> 12:36.683
I'm just... that's an
order, put 'em away.

12:36.716 --> 12:37.616
- Oh, fine.
- Come on.

12:42.454 --> 12:43.622
Look at it.

12:43.656 --> 12:46.024
Look at this shit.

12:46.058 --> 12:47.493
Try to make an honest way
out there.

12:47.526 --> 12:49.962
Without gambling other people's
money, handouts

12:49.995 --> 12:51.230
sucking people dry, you know.

12:53.098 --> 12:54.366
Good luck.

12:56.969 --> 12:59.104
Now look.

12:59.138 --> 13:01.974
Even if he did survive,

13:02.007 --> 13:05.678
Tocho's thugs
would have finished him off.

13:05.712 --> 13:09.081
They don't like leaving things
on unfinished.

13:09.114 --> 13:10.650
Right?

13:10.683 --> 13:14.052
And neither do I, okay.

13:14.086 --> 13:15.554
As a matter of fact, Kevin,

13:15.587 --> 13:17.055
go arrest that
son of a bitch.

13:17.089 --> 13:19.425
Oh, from your lip, Sheriff.

13:19.458 --> 13:21.059
I've been waiting for
those words all day.

13:21.093 --> 13:22.594
As a matter of fact,
me and the Chief in a room

13:22.629 --> 13:24.596
for about, I don't know,
10 minutes,

13:24.631 --> 13:26.298
you're not even gonna need
an arraignment from this guy.

13:26.331 --> 13:28.000
Hey!

13:28.033 --> 13:29.601
Just pick him up,
like I said.

13:29.636 --> 13:31.236
Okay, Kevin?

13:31.270 --> 13:32.271
I've been... that's what
I've been trying to do

13:32.304 --> 13:33.640
the whole time with pleasure.

13:38.544 --> 13:41.714
So um,
you got any friends

13:41.748 --> 13:44.283
you can talk about this with?

13:44.316 --> 13:47.386
Nobody really understands it.

13:47.419 --> 13:50.255
What um... what about um...

13:50.289 --> 13:51.758
- Javon?
- Yeah.

13:51.791 --> 13:53.358
Yeah, he just likes
to make jokes

13:53.392 --> 13:55.494
and never really wants to
talk about anything.

13:55.527 --> 13:57.529
Give it time.

13:57.563 --> 13:58.698
It'll pass.

14:00.199 --> 14:01.433
Okay.

14:04.771 --> 14:06.438
Hey, thanks for staying
so late, okay, Adrianna.

14:06.472 --> 14:08.140
- Sure.
- Appreciate it.

14:08.173 --> 14:09.241
You need a lift home?

14:09.274 --> 14:10.542
No, um, I think I'm good.

14:10.576 --> 14:11.477
You good?

14:12.344 --> 14:12.745
- Yeah, have a goodnight.
- Goodnight.

14:12.779 --> 14:13.780
Yeah, you too.

14:13.813 --> 14:14.714
This fucking guy.

14:14.747 --> 14:16.048
I know.

14:16.081 --> 14:16.716
Hey, how you doing?

14:17.115 --> 14:18.016
Hi.

14:19.686 --> 14:21.520
Wow.

14:23.455 --> 14:25.324
- Evening, officers.
- What are you doing?

14:25.357 --> 14:27.426
Fucking gorgeous out, right?

14:27.459 --> 14:28.460
What are you doing here, Johnny?

14:28.494 --> 14:29.495
I'm loitering.

14:29.528 --> 14:30.496
You're gonna bust me for it?

14:31.798 --> 14:34.199
- You know her?
- Phew, I wish.

14:34.233 --> 14:36.168
Not a lot of real life heroes
in this town.

14:36.201 --> 14:38.070
Present company excluded,
of course.

14:38.103 --> 14:39.171
You're fucking funny, Johnny.

14:39.204 --> 14:40.539
Stay away from her, okay.

14:40.572 --> 14:42.474
What are you her dad?

14:42.508 --> 14:44.376
It's a free country,
Deputy Price.

14:44.409 --> 14:45.645
Johnny, you want me
up your ass again,

14:45.678 --> 14:47.513
'cause if you do,
just say the word.

14:47.546 --> 14:51.416
Oh, you know,
as tempting as that sounds,

14:51.450 --> 14:53.720
sounds like you want it
a lot more than I do.

14:53.753 --> 14:55.487
But don't worry.

14:55.521 --> 14:57.556
I won't tell your girlfriend
about it.

14:57.589 --> 14:58.590
No stop!

14:58.624 --> 14:59.458
Ah fuck!

14:59.491 --> 15:01.126
Deputy Price!

15:01.159 --> 15:04.363
Your hands are so firm
but soft.

15:04.396 --> 15:06.231
I can't imagine
why your wife left you.

15:06.265 --> 15:07.332
Deputy Price back up.

15:07.366 --> 15:08.467
You might be hurting him.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.301
Oh yeah,
am I might hurting him?

15:10.302 --> 15:11.270
And the hair pulling, too.

15:11.303 --> 15:13.272
You know just how I like it.

15:13.305 --> 15:14.373
I'm usually
on the other side though

15:14.406 --> 15:15.307
I'll make an exception
for you.

15:15.507 --> 15:16.375
Yeah, yeah.

15:16.408 --> 15:17.744
Shut up!

15:17.777 --> 15:19.244
I could end you whenever
I want, you know that.

15:19.278 --> 15:21.146
And no one would know anything.

15:21.179 --> 15:22.514
I beg to differ.

15:22.548 --> 15:23.850
Your boss is right there.

15:23.883 --> 15:26.251
He doesn't always see
everything Johnny.

15:26.285 --> 15:27.553
So watch your fucking step,
greaseball.

15:28.487 --> 15:29.388
I'm watching you.

15:29.421 --> 15:31.323
All right, dad.

15:31.356 --> 15:32.825
Anybody got a body cam?

15:32.859 --> 15:33.793
- Hey.
- Shut the fuck up.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.563
I was just about
to leave anyway.

15:37.596 --> 15:38.631
We're watching you,
we're watching you.

15:38.665 --> 15:39.666
And I'm watching you, too.

15:39.699 --> 15:40.833
Get out of here.

15:40.867 --> 15:42.267
Get the fuck out of here,
Johnny.

15:42.301 --> 15:43.101
What, you lost some speed, you
asshole.

15:43.135 --> 15:43.803
Fucking pigs.

15:50.877 --> 15:51.811
I really think
you're getting there

15:51.844 --> 15:52.845
with the crow pose.

15:52.879 --> 15:54.379
I don't know.

15:54.413 --> 15:55.614
I felt like a baby
learning how to walk.

15:55.648 --> 15:56.783
You've been to like
five classes.

15:56.816 --> 15:58.483
Give it time.

15:58.517 --> 16:00.218
I don't know, when am I gonna
stop being so sore?

16:00.252 --> 16:01.754
Depends on the person, but
that's why we're here now.

16:01.788 --> 16:03.488
Put in the work
and then numb the pain.

16:05.190 --> 16:06.525
You think if I flash
the bartender,

16:06.558 --> 16:07.459
he'll give us free drinks?

16:09.194 --> 16:09.896
I don't know, maybe you should
ask your boyfriend.

16:09.929 --> 16:12.865
Ooh hmm, you're sneaky.

16:12.899 --> 16:15.467
Baby, this is my friend
Adrianna from yoga.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.336
Yeah,
she's been talking about you.

16:17.369 --> 16:18.671
She's not as bendy as me yet,

16:18.705 --> 16:20.572
but she's a hot shot
wedding planner.

16:20.606 --> 16:21.573
Yeah.

16:21.607 --> 16:23.141
What do you say baby?

16:23.175 --> 16:24.409
You wanna get married?

16:25.745 --> 16:27.312
I don't know
if I can commit to someone

16:27.346 --> 16:28.815
who goes around flashing
bartenders for alcohol.

16:28.848 --> 16:29.716
Oh no, baby.

16:29.749 --> 16:31.283
It's all top shelf.

16:51.303 --> 16:53.205
Adrianna?

16:53.238 --> 16:55.374
Adrianna!

16:55.407 --> 16:56.909
Damn, how many have you had?

16:56.943 --> 16:58.243
Sorry.

17:00.680 --> 17:01.681
Don't even think about it.

17:01.714 --> 17:03.181
That guy's a fucking creep.

17:04.383 --> 17:06.218
Yeah, he's giving me
weird vibes.

17:06.251 --> 17:08.420
Skins fish at the docks.

17:08.453 --> 17:10.657
Just like they say
he did to his ex-wife.

17:10.690 --> 17:13.492
To be fair,
she was a royal bitch.

17:13.525 --> 17:14.827
Hmm, emphasis on "was".

17:15.828 --> 17:17.229
What?

17:17.262 --> 17:18.831
Yeah, I haven't seen her
in months.

17:18.865 --> 17:20.667
It's probably all bullshit,
but...

17:20.700 --> 17:21.968
Cum-wad!

17:22.001 --> 17:23.770
Why don't you go
take a shower, yeah,

17:23.803 --> 17:25.370
and get the fuck out of here.

17:27.006 --> 17:30.442
Anyways so, do you wanna do
a girl's trip this weekend?

17:30.475 --> 17:32.712
Zack has family plans
and well, drinking alone

17:32.745 --> 17:33.578
makes me feel like
an alcoholic.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.214
Come on, let's be honest,
you kind of are an alcoholic.

17:36.248 --> 17:37.449
I said feel like one.

17:37.482 --> 17:39.451
Ah, I think that could be
lot of fun.

17:39.484 --> 17:40.452
Uh, vacation rental?

17:40.485 --> 17:41.821
Uncle's lake house actually.

17:41.854 --> 17:45.290
He died last month
and well, I scored a key.

17:45.323 --> 17:46.224
Oh, I'm so sorry.

17:46.258 --> 17:47.627
Oh, don't be.

17:47.660 --> 17:48.728
He was a total prick,
but it was the best thing

17:48.761 --> 17:50.830
he ever did for me.

17:50.863 --> 17:52.965
Okay, so well where's
the place?

17:52.999 --> 17:54.332
Black Raven.

17:56.535 --> 17:57.637
Uh, yeah, um...

17:57.670 --> 17:58.805
Don't worry.

17:58.838 --> 18:00.605
It's not near Liberty Manor.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.541
You won't even have to see
it on your way up.

18:02.574 --> 18:05.477
Yeah, um, I don't know.

18:05.510 --> 18:07.379
It'll be totally chill.

18:07.412 --> 18:09.581
Think of it as a work trip.

18:09.614 --> 18:10.950
What do you mean?

18:10.983 --> 18:13.585
It's great for outdoor weddings.

18:13.618 --> 18:15.587
And it's totally gorg during
the spring.

18:15.620 --> 18:18.523
Come, check it out,
take some photos.

18:18.557 --> 18:20.760
Your clients would love it.

18:24.764 --> 18:27.667
Oh, my car just got here
actually.

18:27.700 --> 18:29.401
Um, but I'll... I'll text you.

18:29.434 --> 18:31.536
Hey, think about it.

18:31.570 --> 18:32.805
All right, I will.

18:34.974 --> 18:35.942
Hey, I'll be right back.

18:49.421 --> 18:51.858
You do know it's not nice
to stare, Johnny.

18:51.891 --> 18:53.558
Oh, don't flatter yourself.

18:53.592 --> 18:55.061
I wasn't even looking at you.

18:55.094 --> 18:56.863
Oh, I know.

18:56.896 --> 18:58.965
Adrianna had
your full attention.

18:58.998 --> 19:05.370
Yeah, well, she's a TV star,
real life Wonder Woman.

19:05.403 --> 19:06.706
I'm a big fan.

19:06.739 --> 19:11.476
So, tell me Johnny,

19:11.510 --> 19:14.046
You have the hots
for my friend?

19:14.080 --> 19:18.517
This uh, doesn't do it
for you anymore?

19:18.550 --> 19:23.022
I don't know, you seem pretty
taken, Blondie.

19:23.055 --> 19:25.590
Hmm, that's never stopped you
before.

19:25.624 --> 19:26.893
Well, I guess I have developed

19:26.926 --> 19:27.994
a little self-control.

19:29.629 --> 19:31.463
Keep telling yourself that.

19:32.632 --> 19:35.968
I'm keeping my hands to myself,
all right.

19:36.002 --> 19:39.437
For now,
but I can't help but notice

19:39.471 --> 19:42.975
your little friend is betraying
the calm,

19:43.009 --> 19:46.411
creepy cool thing you got going
in on there.

19:46.444 --> 19:49.782
Well, if you noticed that,

19:49.816 --> 19:51.416
it's probably not that little,
huh.

19:51.449 --> 19:53.820
You know what I think, Johnny?

19:53.853 --> 19:55.988
I think you have
Liberty Manor fetish.

19:57.156 --> 19:58.958
Hot or cold?

19:58.991 --> 20:00.860
Oh, you're burning the fuck up,
but you know what I think?

20:00.893 --> 20:02.061
Hmm.

20:02.094 --> 20:04.897
I think it takes one
to know one.

20:04.931 --> 20:08.935
Hey, all those rumors about me
and my ex-wife,

20:08.968 --> 20:12.638
all that shit that we used
to do together,

20:12.672 --> 20:15.373
you know the kind of shit that
every other little boy

20:15.407 --> 20:17.677
was way too pussy to try
with you.

20:17.710 --> 20:19.111
Hmm.

20:19.145 --> 20:21.814
You know I think you think
about that all the time.

20:21.848 --> 20:22.782
In fact I think
you're thinking

20:22.815 --> 20:24.650
about that right now.

20:24.684 --> 20:25.685
Is that right?

20:25.718 --> 20:26.618
Hmm.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.122
Your boyfriend's waiting.

21:59.011 --> 22:00.813
Shit!

22:08.586 --> 22:11.190
<i>Chief Matty Tocho of the
Wampanoag Indian Tribe</i>

22:11.223 --> 22:13.259
was arraigned in federal court
today

22:13.292 --> 22:15.227
on 20 counts of federal
racketeering,

22:15.261 --> 22:17.797
money laundering
and embezzlement.

22:17.830 --> 22:19.865
He is also facing eight counts
of murder

22:19.899 --> 22:22.068
and the conspiracy
to commit murder.

22:22.101 --> 22:23.803
If convicted of all crimes,

22:23.836 --> 22:26.604
Chief Tocho could be facing
multiple life sentences

22:26.639 --> 22:28.708
with no chance of parole.

22:28.741 --> 22:30.977
However, it is thought that
the prosecution will move

22:31.010 --> 22:33.145
to seek the death penalty.

22:33.179 --> 22:35.181
Chief Tocho has
currently pled not guilty

22:35.214 --> 22:36.481
to all charges.

22:38.284 --> 22:39.584
Oh my God!

22:39.617 --> 22:40.252
What the fuck!
Get away from me!

22:40.286 --> 22:41.619
Get away from me!

22:41.654 --> 22:42.755
It's me, it's me,
it's me, Javon.

22:42.788 --> 22:43.723
It's me.

22:43.756 --> 22:45.191
What the fuck!

22:45.224 --> 22:46.792
I'm sorry.

22:46.826 --> 22:49.161
Where the hell did you even
get that thing?

22:49.195 --> 22:50.296
I made it.

22:50.329 --> 22:51.897
You made it?

22:51.931 --> 22:53.933
Why?

22:53.966 --> 22:57.303
My therapist,
she said uh,

22:57.336 --> 23:00.139
personify the fear
and then, laugh at it.

23:01.974 --> 23:04.243
That is seriously messed up.

23:05.311 --> 23:07.046
It's working.

23:07.079 --> 23:08.948
Not for me.

23:13.119 --> 23:14.153
Thank you.

23:14.186 --> 23:15.187
Mm.

23:17.589 --> 23:19.959
Look, I'm sorry, okay.

23:19.992 --> 23:22.194
I can't help but laugh.

23:23.295 --> 23:26.232
Chase was my best friend.

23:26.265 --> 23:27.967
It's like all I can do is laugh.

23:29.201 --> 23:30.836
I know.

23:30.870 --> 23:32.705
I'm sorry.

23:35.207 --> 23:36.242
You did the right thing,
you know.

23:36.275 --> 23:37.810
Ratting him out, right?

23:39.812 --> 23:42.782
Excuse me, I'm really sorry to
bother you,

23:42.815 --> 23:44.717
but would mind taking
a picture with my daughter?

23:44.750 --> 23:46.919
Uh, sure.

23:46.952 --> 23:47.820
Great, thanks.

23:47.853 --> 23:48.754
Claire, get in there.

23:49.388 --> 23:50.289
Now get right in.

23:50.322 --> 23:51.023
Hi.

23:52.324 --> 23:53.292
All right, squeeze in.

23:53.325 --> 23:54.160
Okay, here we go.

23:54.193 --> 23:55.061
Cheese.

23:55.094 --> 23:56.028
1, 2, 3.

23:56.062 --> 23:57.263
Cheese.

23:57.296 --> 23:58.364
- Oh.
- Thanks.

23:58.397 --> 23:59.965
Thank you so much.

23:59.999 --> 24:01.901
I just want you to know
you're a real model.

24:01.934 --> 24:03.335
She's a...
she's my role model, too.

24:04.770 --> 24:05.905
- Thank you.
- Have a good one.

24:06.972 --> 24:08.240
Phew.

24:08.274 --> 24:10.142
Still fighting off
the paparazzi I see.

24:10.176 --> 24:11.677
I guess so.

24:14.246 --> 24:18.150
So you ever wonder
how you did it?

24:18.184 --> 24:20.152
Did what?

24:20.186 --> 24:21.754
Survived.

24:21.787 --> 24:23.022
The same way you did.

24:23.055 --> 24:25.191
No, not the same.

24:25.224 --> 24:27.193
I died just like everybody else
back there.

24:28.894 --> 24:33.399
The doctors, Jesus,
they saved me,

24:33.432 --> 24:35.668
but I died.

24:35.701 --> 24:37.269
I don't understand.

24:37.303 --> 24:40.973
You... you survived.

24:41.006 --> 24:44.043
You went face to face
with the Chief

24:44.076 --> 24:45.377
and then you killed Damon.

24:45.411 --> 24:46.879
Damon could still
be out there.

24:48.214 --> 24:49.748
Listen girl, that freak is
gone, okay.

24:49.782 --> 24:51.016
And whether you pulled
the trigger or not,

24:51.050 --> 24:52.251
he had it coming.

24:52.284 --> 24:53.686
I mean you really think that
the Chief

24:53.719 --> 24:54.887
was gonna let him live.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.222
You don't know that.

24:56.255 --> 24:58.057
You know Ricky's kid brother,
Perry,

24:58.090 --> 25:00.092
do you know that
he's still missing?

25:00.126 --> 25:01.360
Perry's a fuck-up.

25:01.393 --> 25:02.828
Yeah, okay, but what if
the exact same...

25:02.862 --> 25:04.163
No, what if, what if,

25:04.196 --> 25:06.065
no there's no what-ifs,
Adrianna, okay?

25:06.098 --> 25:07.867
That bastard is gone, okay.

25:07.900 --> 25:10.002
And if he wanted us dead,
he'd come for us.

25:13.205 --> 25:14.406
We'd end up just like them.

25:23.883 --> 25:25.084
I gotta take a piss.

25:26.252 --> 25:27.219
I'll be back.

25:32.391 --> 25:34.393
For the table.

25:34.426 --> 25:36.128
Oh, we didn't order that.

25:36.162 --> 25:37.296
Oh, it's complimentary.

25:37.329 --> 25:38.464
Why?

25:38.497 --> 25:40.032
From an admirer.

25:40.065 --> 25:41.066
Or at least that's what he
called himself.

25:41.100 --> 25:42.301
From who?

25:42.334 --> 25:43.302
He just left actually,
but he said

25:43.335 --> 25:44.904
he wanted to stay anonymous.

25:44.937 --> 25:45.938
But my mom said
she really likes this wine.

25:45.971 --> 25:47.773
It's a bottle of Black Raven.

25:48.741 --> 25:50.809
I don't wanna...

25:50.843 --> 25:52.278
Can you just take it back
please?

25:52.311 --> 25:53.245
Just... just take it back.

25:53.279 --> 25:54.313
Yeah.

26:04.256 --> 26:05.357
Hey, that's your girl
out there?

26:07.459 --> 26:08.427
Do I know you, bro?

26:08.460 --> 26:09.328
I knew it.

26:09.361 --> 26:11.163
I'm just... I'm a big fan.

26:11.197 --> 26:14.333
I uh... you don't know me,
but I know you.

26:14.366 --> 26:16.202
I mean everybody knows, right?

26:16.235 --> 26:19.939
Surviving the slaughterhouse
at Liberty Manor.

26:19.972 --> 26:21.473
I get chills just thinking
about it.

26:21.507 --> 26:23.809
I mean that's like a...
that's a defining moment,

26:23.842 --> 26:25.344
don't you think?

26:25.377 --> 26:27.413
Yeah, I... I guess.

26:27.446 --> 26:29.381
Hey, leave that running,
I'm gonna jump right in.

26:31.984 --> 26:38.857
Honestly,
fearing for your life

26:40.292 --> 26:43.896
that's something most cats don't
get to experience.

26:43.929 --> 26:46.332
Umm, yeah bro.

26:46.365 --> 26:48.033
Whatever you say.

27:04.116 --> 27:05.150
Hey, what you doing?

27:05.184 --> 27:06.452
I... I just got here.

27:06.485 --> 27:08.787
Oh, I'm sorry,
I can't tonight, Javon.

27:08.821 --> 27:10.289
Okay.

27:10.322 --> 27:11.824
What about Saturday?

27:11.857 --> 27:13.959
Uh, you know, I'm...
I'm going away with Tina

27:13.993 --> 27:15.194
for the weekend actually.

27:15.227 --> 27:16.462
She invited me upstate.

27:16.495 --> 27:18.264
Tina...

27:18.297 --> 27:21.300
Ooh, the one that puts those
booty videos on her socials.

27:21.333 --> 27:22.901
Yeah, I know her.

27:22.935 --> 27:25.537
Right, uh anyway um,

27:25.571 --> 27:27.439
she asked me to go to her
uncle's house upstate

27:27.473 --> 27:28.407
for the weekend.

27:28.440 --> 27:29.475
Wait, what?

27:29.508 --> 27:31.243
Uncle's house?

27:31.277 --> 27:33.012
Another mansion
owned by rich white guy

27:33.045 --> 27:34.413
in Black Raven?

27:34.446 --> 27:35.514
Let's think about this
for a second.

27:35.547 --> 27:36.815
Come on, Javon.

27:36.849 --> 27:38.250
How well do you even
know her?

27:38.284 --> 27:39.885
Not as well as you do
apparently

27:39.918 --> 27:40.919
with you following
her page like that.

27:40.953 --> 27:41.887
Okay.

27:42.988 --> 27:44.223
Look, I'm an ass guy.

27:44.256 --> 27:45.457
That's beside the point, okay.

27:45.491 --> 27:46.892
I'm worried this is gonna
trigger you.

27:46.925 --> 27:48.560
You just said it best yourself.

27:48.594 --> 27:50.529
Personify your fears
and then trivialize it.

27:50.562 --> 27:51.497
Right?

27:52.431 --> 27:53.599
Hmmm.

27:53.633 --> 27:54.566
Yeah.

27:54.600 --> 27:55.501
All right.

27:56.468 --> 27:57.936
I'll text you later, okay.

27:59.104 --> 28:00.506
I'll be fine.

28:02.274 --> 28:03.575
You say that now.

28:34.473 --> 28:37.376
Got me down here in this
fucking smelly basement.

28:44.083 --> 28:46.251
You're really messed up,
you know that, right?

28:46.285 --> 28:47.619
Huh?

28:47.654 --> 28:49.021
Hey.

28:52.491 --> 28:54.326
You don't wanna talk, huh?

28:55.260 --> 28:56.295
That's okay.

28:56.328 --> 28:57.429
You know what,

28:57.463 --> 28:59.331
I kind of like the quiet myself.

29:00.199 --> 29:02.635
These guys here though,

29:02.669 --> 29:05.070
they don't like quiet
so much.

29:05.104 --> 29:08.374
So when you're ready, uh,

29:08.407 --> 29:10.576
feel free to make as much noise
as you need to.

29:10.609 --> 29:12.478
Oh yeah, I forgot,

29:13.579 --> 29:16.348
I don't really think you can
hear too much down here.

29:17.516 --> 29:19.051
Have fun, ladies.

29:25.624 --> 29:28.994
So you like to hurt
little kids?

29:32.231 --> 29:33.966
Hey, I'm talking to you!

29:35.401 --> 29:37.970
Cowardly son-of-a-bitch!

29:43.375 --> 29:46.078
Big bad Injun Chief?

29:46.578 --> 29:48.013
I'm fucking impressed.

29:48.046 --> 29:49.615
You don't seem so tough
to me.

29:49.649 --> 29:50.549
Come on, Tommy.

29:50.582 --> 29:51.483
He's had enough!

29:51.517 --> 29:52.652
He's had enough.

29:52.685 --> 29:54.153
Get off me. Get off me!

29:54.186 --> 29:55.087
Look at him, he's had enough!

29:55.120 --> 29:56.255
Has he Billy?

29:56.288 --> 29:57.256
Have you, Chief?

29:57.289 --> 29:58.557
Have you had enough?

30:00.192 --> 30:03.595
The only good Indian
is a dead Indian.

30:03.630 --> 30:05.330
Stop it, Tommy!

30:05.364 --> 30:07.466
Are you seriously taking
this savage's side?

30:07.499 --> 30:08.635
No.

30:08.668 --> 30:10.102
Why am I not surprised?

30:10.135 --> 30:11.970
I said,
I'm not taking his side.

30:12.004 --> 30:14.406
I just want you to stop.

30:15.708 --> 30:17.342
Okay.

30:17.376 --> 30:18.477
Okay.

30:28.788 --> 30:33.492
This is nothing compared to
what you're gonna get

30:33.525 --> 30:35.494
on the inside.

30:35.527 --> 30:39.431
You're being transferred to
maximum security tomorrow,

30:39.465 --> 30:41.333
Kemosabe.

30:42.735 --> 30:45.170
That's when the real fun begins.

30:53.713 --> 30:55.547
Billy,
clean his ass up.

30:55.581 --> 30:56.749
You made a mess.

31:05.658 --> 31:09.428
Johnny, double-check we got
enough bait for tomorrow.

31:10.496 --> 31:12.164
We're starting early.

31:12.197 --> 31:15.534
Yeah actually,
I'm not gonna be in tomorrow

31:15.567 --> 31:16.535
or the day after that.

31:16.568 --> 31:17.704
I need a couple of days off.

31:17.737 --> 31:19.605
What?

31:19.639 --> 31:21.340
You never told me.

31:21.373 --> 31:23.542
Well, I'm uh...
I'm kinda telling you now.

31:23.575 --> 31:25.344
Sorry, Johnny.

31:25.377 --> 31:27.446
We're barely making numbers
as it is.

31:27.479 --> 31:29.414
I need you tomorrow.

31:29.448 --> 31:30.750
Did you hear what I said?

31:30.783 --> 31:31.751
Did you hear what I said?

31:31.784 --> 31:34.219
It's two fucking days.

31:34.253 --> 31:37.757
Well, if you said I don't want a
job anymore,

31:37.790 --> 31:41.460
then yeah, I heard exactly what
you said.

31:41.493 --> 31:43.161
Look, I've been working with
you for a long time.

31:43.195 --> 31:45.197
I've done everything
you asked me to.

31:45.230 --> 31:46.666
I'm asking for
two fucking days

31:46.699 --> 31:48.500
and you're giving me
a problem.

31:48.534 --> 31:50.269
You know what,
don't waste my fucking time.

31:50.302 --> 31:51.203
You're fired.

31:51.236 --> 31:52.604
Get the hell out of here.

31:54.473 --> 31:55.675
Okay.

31:55.708 --> 31:57.376
I just...
I gotta get my stuff.

32:00.412 --> 32:02.080
Did you hear what I said?

32:02.114 --> 32:04.216
I could come back on Monday
and get my checks

32:04.249 --> 32:05.617
for two days off

32:05.652 --> 32:07.352
or I could choke you
to death here

32:07.386 --> 32:08.520
and nobody's gonna
fucking see it.

32:08.554 --> 32:09.656
So what's it gonna be,
Captain?

32:09.689 --> 32:10.589
What's it gonna be,
Captain?

32:10.622 --> 32:11.456
Fucking go.

32:11.490 --> 32:13.292
Go, go!

32:13.325 --> 32:15.127
That's a good choice, Captain.

32:15.160 --> 32:16.829
That's a good choice.

32:16.863 --> 32:18.230
Fucking mutt.

32:27.306 --> 32:28.340
You like tequila, right?

32:28.373 --> 32:29.374
Yeah, sure.

32:29.408 --> 32:30.609
I'm gonna make a quick run.

32:30.643 --> 32:31.644
We've got a lot of stuff
at the house,

32:31.678 --> 32:33.445
but feeling margaritas.

32:33.478 --> 32:34.781
Yeah, sounds good actually.

32:34.814 --> 32:36.381
Yeah.

32:36.415 --> 32:38.818
Hey, I wanted to tell you
thanks for the invite.

32:38.851 --> 32:40.218
You know, things have just
kind of been

32:40.252 --> 32:41.386
sort of rough lately

32:41.420 --> 32:44.189
and it's just nice
to get out.

32:44.222 --> 32:45.123
Of course.

32:46.592 --> 32:47.894
I honestly feel like
I'm already out of my head

32:47.927 --> 32:49.494
and I kind of forgot
what that felt like.

32:53.565 --> 32:54.600
Tacos.

32:54.634 --> 32:56.234
Sounds good.

32:57.937 --> 32:59.171
Adrianna?

33:38.845 --> 33:39.912
That all for you, girlie?

33:41.546 --> 33:43.348
Gotta make sure I don't get
thirsty tonight.

33:46.451 --> 33:47.787
I don't know if you've seen
the news,

33:47.820 --> 33:49.789
but he's going away
for a very long time.

33:49.822 --> 33:51.658
You'll never have to
see him again, okay.

33:53.358 --> 33:55.227
So you sleep any better?

33:55.260 --> 33:56.696
Depends on the night.

33:57.664 --> 33:58.831
You're not calling to check up
in on me

33:58.865 --> 34:00.900
as much as you used to.

34:00.933 --> 34:02.869
I'm not your dad.

34:02.902 --> 34:04.369
Anyway, I'm here to help

34:04.403 --> 34:06.839
and you have
my direct cell, so

34:06.873 --> 34:07.807
use it, okay, honey.

34:07.840 --> 34:08.641
Okay.

34:09.942 --> 34:11.276
There's a party
in Black Raven later.

34:12.812 --> 34:14.346
Oh, is that so?

34:14.379 --> 34:16.415
Mhmm.

34:16.448 --> 34:17.549
Wanna come?

34:18.818 --> 34:20.552
Uh, time?

34:22.354 --> 34:23.622
All night.

34:24.657 --> 34:26.693
Really?

34:26.726 --> 34:29.494
I really do appreciate
the invitation, young lady,

34:29.528 --> 34:32.965
and uh... but I'm kind of
old enough to be your father.

34:32.999 --> 34:33.900
Thank you, though.

34:36.268 --> 34:38.971
Maybe I like that,
uh Victor.

34:42.541 --> 34:44.342
You got ID?

34:45.044 --> 34:46.979
You don't think I'm old enough
to party?

34:48.313 --> 34:50.449
I wasn't sayin' that,
but there's a cop outside

34:50.482 --> 34:52.517
and ID now.

34:56.488 --> 34:58.256
Dominant.

34:58.290 --> 34:59.324
Cute.

35:08.333 --> 35:09.468
Now listen, now you uh...

35:11.637 --> 35:13.271
you don't go too crazy tonight,
sweetheart, okay.

35:13.305 --> 35:14.573
Have a good time.

35:15.775 --> 35:18.443
You don't need to worry
about me, daddy.

35:21.613 --> 35:25.752
And uh, keep the change.

35:27.419 --> 35:28.755
If you wanna get that stick
out of your ass

35:28.788 --> 35:30.790
and come later...

35:34.359 --> 35:37.562
...that is where I'll be.

35:48.340 --> 35:50.810
Hey, hey, hello?

35:50.843 --> 35:52.044
Hey, buddy, you gonna pay
for that?

35:52.078 --> 35:53.813
Of course.

35:53.846 --> 35:57.083
What, mom never let you have
snack in the store before?

35:57.116 --> 35:58.885
Hey, man, I don't give a shit
about what your mom

35:58.918 --> 36:00.753
didn't teach you, okay.

36:00.787 --> 36:04.523
Oh, you talk that way
to a customer?

36:04.556 --> 36:05.858
Hey, you're stealing right
in front of my face.

36:05.892 --> 36:07.093
You ain't no customer.

36:07.126 --> 36:08.861
What the fuck!

36:08.895 --> 36:10.930
Well now, technically
I haven't left the store yet,

36:10.963 --> 36:13.833
so I didn't steal anything,
but I bet you if I was

36:13.866 --> 36:15.802
shaking my ass
in front of your face...

36:15.835 --> 36:17.469
All right.

36:17.502 --> 36:18.303
You'd probably give me some
better customer service.

36:18.603 --> 36:19.672
Well, here's an idea.

36:19.705 --> 36:20.640
Why don't you
get the hell out

36:20.673 --> 36:21.707
of my fucking store, okay!

36:22.675 --> 36:23.441
No, we don't need to have
this conversation.

36:23.475 --> 36:23.508
All right,
why don't you make me?

36:28.948 --> 36:31.784
I see it.

36:31.818 --> 36:34.352
The darkness in you,
I see it.

36:34.386 --> 36:35.121
Oh, you do, do you?

36:35.154 --> 36:37.589
Yeah, and I feel it.

36:37.622 --> 36:42.061
Whatever you're thinking,
whatever you're planning,

36:43.595 --> 36:46.833
yeah, there's another path,
my brother.

36:48.167 --> 36:51.403
Trust me when I tell you
I have been there.

36:55.141 --> 36:57.910
Thank you.

36:57.944 --> 36:59.511
I'm sorry, thank you.

37:00.646 --> 37:03.448
Yeah, that hundred
she gave you,

37:03.481 --> 37:05.952
should be enough to cover
the nips

37:05.985 --> 37:07.552
and that shit advice.

37:10.488 --> 37:12.390
Have a nice suck!

37:16.095 --> 37:16.963
Look at that.

37:16.996 --> 37:18.130
Tina.

37:19.732 --> 37:21.533
You two know each other?

37:21.566 --> 37:23.703
We've met once or twice.

37:23.736 --> 37:25.771
A few times actually.

37:25.805 --> 37:26.873
So those bottles

37:26.906 --> 37:27.840
they stay sealed
until you get

37:27.874 --> 37:28.774
where you're going, right?

37:28.808 --> 37:29.942
Mhmm.

37:29.976 --> 37:30.877
All right,
you stay out of trouble.

37:30.910 --> 37:31.978
Both of you.

37:32.011 --> 37:33.913
Especially you.

37:33.946 --> 37:34.847
Okay.

37:36.215 --> 37:37.415
Let's go.

37:37.449 --> 37:38.150
Sure.

37:57.770 --> 37:58.804
Woah, dude, slow down.

38:00.505 --> 38:01.841
You wanna have some fun today?

38:01.874 --> 38:02.975
Come on, it's fun.

38:03.009 --> 38:04.110
Tina, Tina, Tina,
please God.

38:04.143 --> 38:05.811
Look, I can drive
with my knees.

38:05.845 --> 38:06.779
Jesus.

38:07.747 --> 38:08.580
Tina, oh my God!

38:08.613 --> 38:09.649
Come on, Tina, get over.

38:09.682 --> 38:10.650
Tina, Tina.

38:10.683 --> 38:11.684
I just need you to get over!

38:11.717 --> 38:13.152
- Stop!
- What!

38:13.185 --> 38:14.486
Talm down!

38:14.519 --> 38:15.855
What are you doing?

38:15.888 --> 38:17.189
Calm down.

38:17.223 --> 38:18.991
You said you wanted
to have fun today.

38:19.025 --> 38:21.459
- You almost killed us there.
- You're gonna kill us.

38:21.493 --> 38:23.062
Are you kidding me, dude?

38:23.095 --> 38:25.530
- Let's have some fun.
- Jesus.

38:58.530 --> 38:59.865
Wow, Tina.

38:59.899 --> 39:01.834
This place would be fit
for a wedding.

39:01.867 --> 39:03.169
Right, I told you.

39:03.202 --> 39:04.270
Beautiful here.

39:04.303 --> 39:05.638
Do you trust me now?

39:05.671 --> 39:07.006
I guess, starting to.

39:07.039 --> 39:07.974
Okay.

39:10.209 --> 39:13.112
Hey, I think I know
that guy.

39:13.145 --> 39:14.612
Really?

39:14.647 --> 39:15.547
Yo, Greene.

39:15.580 --> 39:16.949
You know my friend here?

39:16.983 --> 39:19.517
Yeah, you used to know
Chase Larsen.

39:20.920 --> 39:22.922
And you know, I was the...
the groundskeeper

39:22.955 --> 39:24.223
for the Larsens.

39:24.256 --> 39:25.623
And respectfully,

39:25.658 --> 39:27.193
you should not be on these
grounds.

39:27.893 --> 39:28.961
Excuse me?

39:32.064 --> 39:32.999
Tina?

39:33.032 --> 39:33.899
You know...

39:36.936 --> 39:40.740
Tina, before your uncle died,
he had it in his will

39:40.773 --> 39:43.209
that no one should visit
these grounds

39:43.242 --> 39:44.210
until the estate was settled.

39:45.610 --> 39:47.046
And it's not settled.

39:47.079 --> 39:49.215
Interesting.

39:49.248 --> 39:53.019
Well, let me be equally
as clear.

39:54.320 --> 39:57.056
Bardley's the last name
on your check.

39:57.089 --> 40:01.761
And my last name is Bardsley,
so my friend is staying.

40:02.194 --> 40:03.561
Okay, thanks.

40:03.595 --> 40:06.165
Go back to your uh, raking.

40:09.601 --> 40:11.203
You're making a mistake.

40:11.237 --> 40:12.872
Both of you.

40:12.905 --> 40:14.006
Come on.

40:14.040 --> 40:15.341
You have to see this.

40:15.374 --> 40:16.308
It's perfect for pictures.

40:36.762 --> 40:38.596
Billy Horton?

40:39.899 --> 40:41.300
Really?

40:42.334 --> 40:43.969
Officer Horton.

40:46.806 --> 40:48.641
Is there a problem?

40:49.809 --> 40:51.911
No problem,
Billy Blackhawk.

40:54.113 --> 40:55.881
Yeah, I knew your father, Mato.

40:57.249 --> 41:00.019
And his father.

41:00.052 --> 41:01.619
You descend from great men.

41:04.156 --> 41:05.991
Thank you.

41:06.025 --> 41:07.660
It's a pity
where you ended up.

41:07.693 --> 41:08.360
Don't.

41:10.196 --> 41:13.065
Was saddened to heard that your
family lost their land.

41:13.099 --> 41:14.366
It was a travesty.

41:18.170 --> 41:20.906
My parents never really
got over that.

41:20.940 --> 41:22.875
The trail of tears continues to
wind its way

41:22.908 --> 41:23.943
through the present.

41:27.146 --> 41:31.183
Would your family be proud
of you, Officer Horton?

41:31.217 --> 41:32.751
I changed my name,

41:32.785 --> 41:34.019
because Billy Horton
is gonna get promoted

41:34.053 --> 41:37.156
a lot faster than
Billy Blackhawk, okay.

41:39.125 --> 41:42.695
You can't change
who you are, Billy.

41:42.728 --> 41:44.096
You think if I changed
my name,

41:44.130 --> 41:45.865
your boss wouldn't have been so
rough on me?

41:45.898 --> 41:48.400
Look, what he did was wrong.

41:48.434 --> 41:50.436
Our blood is the same, Billy.

41:50.469 --> 41:51.437
We're family.

41:51.470 --> 41:54.273
F... you killed kids.

41:54.306 --> 41:55.774
I didn't kill anyone.

41:55.808 --> 41:57.376
You gave the order.

41:57.409 --> 41:59.278
That... that's the same
fucking thing.

41:59.311 --> 42:00.880
You should've gone to
the fucking police.

42:01.981 --> 42:03.149
And what?

42:03.182 --> 42:04.717
Get an earlier start
on my facial

42:04.750 --> 42:06.152
reconstructive surgery?

42:06.185 --> 42:08.821
They're... they're...
they're not all like that.

42:08.854 --> 42:11.390
Jesus, you're so goddamn
naive, Billy.

42:11.423 --> 42:13.392
You'll never be one of them.

42:13.425 --> 42:14.860
They won't let you.

42:16.095 --> 42:17.363
Stop talking.

42:17.396 --> 42:18.998
If you send me to prison,

42:19.031 --> 42:20.699
my blood will be
on our hands.

42:20.733 --> 42:23.969
I got no other choice.

42:24.003 --> 42:25.304
You can let me go free.

42:27.840 --> 42:28.974
You want to.

42:29.008 --> 42:29.909
I can sense it.

42:29.942 --> 42:31.243
No.

42:32.511 --> 42:34.079
Do the honorable thing, Billy.

42:35.114 --> 42:36.015
Let me go.

42:36.048 --> 42:37.316
I'll lose my job.

42:39.785 --> 42:41.120
Come work for me.

42:41.153 --> 42:42.955
Just shut up!

42:42.988 --> 42:44.990
Okay!

42:45.024 --> 42:46.258
Just shut up!

42:50.162 --> 42:51.997
Goddamn!

42:54.033 --> 42:55.701
Fuck!

42:56.402 --> 42:57.937
We can make it look like
a struggle.

43:08.781 --> 43:10.316
Make yourself at home.

43:10.349 --> 43:11.350
Mi casa, su casa.

43:12.918 --> 43:14.153
It's beautiful here.

43:14.186 --> 43:15.521
Yeah, I dated
this exchange student

43:15.554 --> 43:17.389
from Spain, he was so hot.

43:21.527 --> 43:23.095
Everything okay?

43:23.562 --> 43:25.064
Yeah, it just... this place kind
of reminds me

43:25.097 --> 43:26.532
of little bit
of Liberty Manor.

43:26.565 --> 43:29.301
It's weird, you know,
being back in Black Raven.

43:29.335 --> 43:31.503
Come here, baby.

43:33.539 --> 43:35.341
You need to relax.

43:35.374 --> 43:37.009
Let me take care of you,
I'm a great hostess,

43:37.042 --> 43:38.344
I promised.

43:38.377 --> 43:39.345
Okay.

43:39.378 --> 43:40.846
Oh, you're gonna love this.

43:40.879 --> 43:41.780
Come on.

43:45.017 --> 43:45.985
Wow.

43:46.018 --> 43:46.919
Right?

43:46.952 --> 43:48.354
That's incredible.

43:48.387 --> 43:50.022
A couple of drinks out here
will put your mind

43:50.055 --> 43:51.257
at ease, girlfriend.

43:51.290 --> 43:52.424
Works every time.

43:54.193 --> 43:56.395
It's so nice here
in the summer.

43:56.428 --> 43:58.864
Too bad it's too cold
to go swimming.

43:58.897 --> 44:00.366
Yeah, but I didn't bring
a bathing suit.

44:01.400 --> 44:02.968
You could have skinny dipped.

44:04.370 --> 44:06.038
Wanna see my favorite room?

44:09.842 --> 44:12.311
Okay, keep your eyes closed.

44:12.344 --> 44:14.079
Eyes closed,
we're almost there.

44:14.113 --> 44:14.947
Okay, ready?

44:14.980 --> 44:16.315
Mhmm.

44:16.348 --> 44:17.383
Open.

44:19.285 --> 44:20.552
What the fuck, Tina?

44:20.586 --> 44:22.921
It's sick, right?

44:22.955 --> 44:25.324
This is everything that came
from Liberty Manor.

44:25.357 --> 44:27.326
Where did you get this?

44:27.359 --> 44:30.863
Well, Larsens closed up shop,
and well,

44:30.896 --> 44:33.365
we took everything
off their hands.

44:33.399 --> 44:35.901
Some of this stuff is really
fucking valuable,

44:35.934 --> 44:37.903
but they didn't want anything
to do with it.

44:37.936 --> 44:39.038
Yeah, no shit.

44:40.272 --> 44:42.341
I mean look at it.

44:42.374 --> 44:44.943
It's fucking dope.

44:44.977 --> 44:46.345
We have it all here.

44:46.378 --> 44:47.413
Except for the ring.

44:47.446 --> 44:49.615
Yeah.

44:49.649 --> 44:52.184
You don't know
where it is, do you?

44:52.217 --> 44:54.320
Can we get it?

44:54.353 --> 44:56.088
Listen to me carefully,
Tina.

44:56.121 --> 44:57.389
All of this stuff is cursed.

44:57.423 --> 44:58.891
It's haunted.

44:58.924 --> 44:59.525
You don't want the ring,
and you don't want

44:59.558 --> 45:02.127
any of this stuff.

45:02.161 --> 45:04.930
Yeah but you haven't even seen
the best item here yet.

45:05.931 --> 45:10.302
My uh, prized possession.

45:18.177 --> 45:19.211
Where did you get that?

45:20.045 --> 45:21.547
I saw you.

45:21.580 --> 45:23.182
What?

45:23.215 --> 45:27.119
On the beach, burying it.

45:27.152 --> 45:29.421
No, no, no, Tina you should not
have taken that.

45:29.455 --> 45:30.589
You should not have
done that.

45:30.622 --> 45:32.925
It's just a mask.

45:32.958 --> 45:34.126
You killed the creep.

45:34.159 --> 45:35.027
He was the threat.

45:35.060 --> 45:36.428
Not that thing.

45:36.462 --> 45:37.296
Don't tell me what I know
and what I don't know.

45:37.329 --> 45:38.130
That mask is cursed.

45:38.163 --> 45:39.264
Bullshit.

45:39.298 --> 45:40.299
Are you kidding me?

45:40.332 --> 45:41.533
Everything in here is cursed,

45:41.567 --> 45:42.635
and it all started
with that ring.

45:44.637 --> 45:45.904
Tell me what happened.

45:45.938 --> 45:47.272
Let go of me.

45:47.306 --> 45:49.975
Where were you the first time
you saw him?

45:50.008 --> 45:51.143
The first time
you saw Damon?

45:51.176 --> 45:52.010
- What?
- Who did he kill first?

45:52.044 --> 45:53.045
Stop it.

45:53.078 --> 45:54.213
It wasn't all about the ring.

45:54.246 --> 45:56.014
He enjoyed the killings, right?

45:56.048 --> 45:56.949
Why are you doing this?

45:56.982 --> 45:58.050
Because I need to know.

45:58.083 --> 45:59.284
Is this why you brought me here?

46:01.688 --> 46:02.921
Who's that?

46:04.456 --> 46:05.991
Let the fun begin.

46:12.431 --> 46:14.099
Butchie?

46:14.133 --> 46:16.034
Where's my Butchie boy?

46:16.068 --> 46:17.603
Daddy's home.

46:19.171 --> 46:20.973
Butchie?

46:21.006 --> 46:22.174
Where's my big boy?

46:23.676 --> 46:25.077
Got your favorite.

46:27.012 --> 46:28.580
Butchie.

46:31.617 --> 46:32.518
Butchie boy.

46:32.551 --> 46:34.319
Where's my big boy?

46:34.353 --> 46:36.188
Butchie?

46:43.195 --> 46:44.697
- Shit, Price!
- Whoa, whoa.

46:44.731 --> 46:46.465
Relax.

46:46.498 --> 46:48.000
How'd you get in here?

46:48.033 --> 46:50.436
Hello, with the key
like you told me.

46:50.469 --> 46:52.070
What are you talking about?

46:52.104 --> 46:54.072
You just sent me a text
on your burner phone

46:54.106 --> 46:55.507
said you met with Tocho.

46:55.541 --> 46:57.109
What's going on?

46:57.142 --> 46:58.444
I still don't know what you're
talking about

46:58.477 --> 47:00.112
and I ain't got
no burner phone.

47:00.145 --> 47:02.080
No, well I do.

47:03.215 --> 47:04.684
No, no, stop.

47:04.717 --> 47:06.084
Not supposed to be
in here, no.

47:06.118 --> 47:07.119
Can't hear you, man.

47:07.152 --> 47:07.986
Hi beautiful.

47:08.020 --> 47:09.054
Hi baby.

47:11.523 --> 47:14.092
Ms. Bardsley, Tina?

47:14.126 --> 47:17.229
You know that no one is
supposed to be in here.

47:17.262 --> 47:20.599
Tina, is that how you're gonna
say hi to me, too?

47:20.633 --> 47:23.101
If you want me to.

47:23.135 --> 47:25.404
Get a couple drinks in me
and we'll see what happens.

47:25.437 --> 47:28.006
I would not be opposed
to that.

47:28.040 --> 47:29.308
What's up, Spencer baby?

47:29.341 --> 47:30.576
Looking good, Tina.

47:30.609 --> 47:31.678
Is that why you want me
to make out

47:31.711 --> 47:32.679
with your girlfriend?

47:32.712 --> 47:33.579
Doesn't hurt.

47:34.714 --> 47:36.749
Ms. Bardsley, I... I were...

47:36.783 --> 47:38.617
Mr. Greene,

47:38.651 --> 47:40.185
if you wanted to be a part
of the fun,

47:40.219 --> 47:41.587
all you had to do is ask.

47:41.620 --> 47:42.655
Oh no, I don't want that.

47:42.689 --> 47:44.757
It's not what I want.

47:44.791 --> 47:47.226
I know it's not your scene.

47:47.259 --> 47:51.430
Yo guys, this is my new
yoga bestie, Adrianna.

47:51.463 --> 47:52.431
Hey guys.

47:52.464 --> 47:53.432
Oh shit.

47:53.465 --> 47:54.767
You're that chick from TV.

47:54.801 --> 47:56.101
The killer.

47:56.134 --> 47:56.769
Stone cold.

47:56.803 --> 47:58.270
Bad ass.

47:58.303 --> 48:00.472
I love true crime.

48:00.506 --> 48:03.275
Ms. Bardsley, may I have
a word with you?

48:03.308 --> 48:04.744
Goddammit.

48:04.777 --> 48:06.679
Zack, can you go show them
the rest of the house?

48:06.713 --> 48:08.213
Of course, baby.

48:08.247 --> 48:09.348
All right, guys,
come on, let's go.

48:09.381 --> 48:10.349
Come on.

48:10.382 --> 48:12.819
Good luck with all that.

48:12.852 --> 48:15.420
His intentions were
not to have any onlookers

48:15.454 --> 48:16.689
or interlopers.

48:16.723 --> 48:18.056
No one should...

48:18.090 --> 48:19.458
Enough.

48:19.491 --> 48:23.295
You work for me,
you got it?

48:23.328 --> 48:25.798
I worked for your uncle,
you spoiled bitch.

48:25.832 --> 48:27.599
Excuse me?

48:27.634 --> 48:29.702
My uncle's dead.

48:29.736 --> 48:33.472
You work for
Bardsley Holdings LLC.

48:33.505 --> 48:35.374
Last time I checked,
I'm the only Bardsley

48:35.407 --> 48:38.176
in 50-mile radius
in this town.

48:38.210 --> 48:41.113
Your ass is mine this weekend,
you got it?

48:42.147 --> 48:43.549
I said, you got it?

48:43.582 --> 48:45.517
Get away from me,
you stupid bitch!

48:45.551 --> 48:47.085
What is wrong with you?

48:47.119 --> 48:48.086
Oh my God, calm down.

48:48.120 --> 48:49.121
You're fucking fired!

48:49.154 --> 48:50.489
I'm sorry.

48:50.522 --> 48:51.390
- I want him gone.
- I get it, get out of here.

48:51.423 --> 48:52.324
I got it.

48:52.357 --> 48:53.793
What the fuck was that?

48:53.826 --> 48:56.495
I'm very sorry,
I will go talk to her,

48:56.528 --> 48:58.096
I need this job.

48:58.130 --> 48:58.798
No, no, not happening.

48:58.831 --> 49:00.432
That's a really bad idea.

49:00.465 --> 49:02.869
I think you just need
to stay here, calm down,

49:02.902 --> 49:04.737
go back to wherever you live
on this property,

49:04.771 --> 49:06.739
and I'll talk to her
in the morning.

49:06.773 --> 49:09.141
I meant what I said.

49:09.174 --> 49:11.577
None of you should be in
Black Raven,

49:11.610 --> 49:13.312
especially you.

49:28.260 --> 49:30.830
Look at me.

49:30.863 --> 49:32.431
I need your help.

49:32.464 --> 49:35.233
And I don't have much time.

49:35.267 --> 49:39.304
Do as I say
and you won't end up like,

49:39.338 --> 49:40.907
what'd you call him,
"Butchie boy".

49:42.307 --> 49:43.275
Shut up!

49:44.376 --> 49:48.280
I need you to track a number
at the police station.

49:48.313 --> 49:50.817
The name is Adrianna Reyes.

49:50.850 --> 49:54.119
Nod yes if you understand.

49:56.756 --> 49:58.290
Good.

49:58.323 --> 50:00.425
I'm going to remove your gag.

50:00.459 --> 50:04.664
If you make trouble,
I'll break your fucking neck.

50:04.697 --> 50:07.667
Again, nod yes
if you understand.

50:21.948 --> 50:24.851
This is CO Tommy Flanagan.

50:24.884 --> 50:29.756
Badge number 5237909.

50:29.789 --> 50:32.624
I need to track a cell phone.

50:32.659 --> 50:38.597
The number is 203-555-1501.

50:38.631 --> 50:40.633
The name is Adrianna Reyes.

50:44.336 --> 50:45.570
The cell
phone is tracked

50:45.604 --> 50:47.840
to 4115 Redwood Circle, Black
Raven.

50:47.874 --> 50:49.241
Thank you.

50:51.778 --> 50:53.746
I did what you asked.

50:54.647 --> 50:55.948
You're right.

50:55.982 --> 50:57.684
Seems I have no use
for you anymore.

50:58.785 --> 50:59.652
Don't, don't.

51:01.721 --> 51:03.388
You know what they say?

51:03.422 --> 51:05.992
The only good racist piece of
trash is a dead one.

51:12.899 --> 51:15.233
You know you really messed up
this time, right?

51:17.335 --> 51:18.738
Yeah, you don't need to
answer that.

51:18.771 --> 51:19.939
Fuck you.

51:21.841 --> 51:24.476
Well, if you insist.

51:24.509 --> 51:26.411
You have no fucking clue
who you're messing with.

51:26.445 --> 51:28.513
You know I thought about
leaving your corpse

51:28.547 --> 51:29.949
recognizable
for your family,

51:29.982 --> 51:31.283
but now I'm not so sure.

51:31.316 --> 51:32.551
Yeah.

51:32.584 --> 51:33.618
Fat boy, what the fuck are you
gonna do?

51:40.292 --> 51:41.694
You want us to clean
this up, Chief?

51:41.728 --> 51:42.995
It's too messy to make it look
like

51:43.029 --> 51:45.297
they did it to themselves.

51:45.330 --> 51:47.332
Leave it.

51:47.365 --> 51:49.501
They'll know it was me
sooner or later.

51:54.874 --> 51:56.274
Perfect timing.

51:56.308 --> 51:57.877
Adrianna, here.

51:57.910 --> 51:59.544
Thanks.

51:59.578 --> 52:00.646
I hope that creepy Mr. Greene
didn't try to make

52:00.680 --> 52:02.514
a move on you.

52:02.547 --> 52:05.417
I don't think he's actually seen
tits since 2003.

52:05.450 --> 52:06.719
No, he was fine.

52:06.753 --> 52:08.353
I know he's a little eccentric,

52:08.386 --> 52:09.956
but I think he was really sorry
at the end of it.

52:09.989 --> 52:11.758
Too little too late
for that.

52:13.325 --> 52:14.961
Hey, are... are you okay?

52:16.062 --> 52:17.797
It's just
I wasn't expecting this.

52:17.830 --> 52:18.965
Them?

52:18.998 --> 52:21.433
They're so chill, I promise.

52:21.466 --> 52:23.468
I just felt like you needed
a little party.

52:23.502 --> 52:25.537
I know you would have said
no if I asked.

52:25.570 --> 52:27.039
It's not just that.

52:27.073 --> 52:28.607
What do you mean?

52:28.641 --> 52:31.610
Tina, that room,
with all of that stuff.

52:31.644 --> 52:33.612
I get intense, I know.

52:33.646 --> 52:34.881
Intense?

52:34.914 --> 52:36.414
You had me pinned up
against a wall.

52:36.448 --> 52:38.617
But I really love curses
and legends,

52:38.651 --> 52:40.519
and haunted houses,
and all that shit.

52:40.552 --> 52:41.988
Yeah, and I get that,
but I almost died

52:42.021 --> 52:43.689
at Liberty Manor.

52:43.723 --> 52:45.925
So I get why Mr. Greene's
weirded out by all of this.

52:45.958 --> 52:47.760
I'm sorry I didn't mean
to trigger you.

52:47.794 --> 52:51.097
I just, I felt like maybe
it would help you, you know.

52:51.130 --> 52:52.832
It would help you get over
your fear.

52:54.432 --> 52:55.467
Yeah.

52:55.500 --> 52:57.003
You're right.

52:57.036 --> 52:59.105
Maybe I should just loosen up
and have a good time.

52:59.138 --> 53:01.506
Plus, you can write
a tell-all book

53:01.540 --> 53:02.975
and make a shit ton of money.

53:03.009 --> 53:05.678
And I'll only ask
for 10 percent,

53:06.779 --> 53:07.612
Shut up.

53:08.613 --> 53:09.581
Are we good?

53:09.614 --> 53:10.448
I think so.

53:10.482 --> 53:11.651
Good.

53:11.684 --> 53:13.052
Hey ladies,
come on let's party,

53:13.085 --> 53:14.120
let's go.

53:14.153 --> 53:15.021
Hey guys what's up?

53:15.054 --> 53:15.922
Let's fucking do it.

53:15.955 --> 53:16.989
Yeah, let's go bro.

53:19.457 --> 53:21.526
I got the bottle.

53:21.560 --> 53:23.395
You gotta give
her a cup, man.

53:23.428 --> 53:27.465
A little for you,
a little for you,

53:27.499 --> 53:28.567
can't forget you.

53:30.736 --> 53:31.904
All right.

53:31.938 --> 53:33.538
Babe.

53:33.572 --> 53:34.439
Oh, did you want some?

53:34.472 --> 53:35.641
Yeah, I want some.

53:36.943 --> 53:38.410
But I have the bottle.

53:38.443 --> 53:39.444
Well, you should give it
to me.

53:39.477 --> 53:40.813
And why is that?

53:40.847 --> 53:42.114
'Cause you just gave it
to everyone else.

53:42.148 --> 53:44.851
Maybe I wanna make you
work for it.

53:44.884 --> 53:45.918
Yeah.

53:45.952 --> 53:48.154
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

53:48.187 --> 53:50.056
Hey.

53:50.089 --> 53:51.958
Hi, what's your guys'
names again?

53:51.991 --> 53:52.859
Sonja.

53:52.892 --> 53:53.726
Spencer.

53:53.759 --> 53:54.626
Cool.

53:54.660 --> 53:55.661
Adrianna.

53:55.695 --> 53:56.528
Again.

53:56.561 --> 53:57.763
We know.

53:57.797 --> 53:59.464
Big fans.

53:59.497 --> 54:01.667
Seems like everybody is
these days.

54:01.701 --> 54:02.601
Are you tired of it?

54:02.635 --> 54:04.502
It's just,

54:04.536 --> 54:06.906
I never really asked for it
is all.

54:06.939 --> 54:08.741
Better that than the
alternative though, right?

54:11.811 --> 54:14.080
Being dead I mean.

54:14.113 --> 54:19.584
Well, obviously, it's just...
no, you're right.

54:19.618 --> 54:20.887
I'm very thankful

54:20.920 --> 54:23.089
and I'm just gonna
have a good time, right.

54:23.122 --> 54:24.790
Y'all are depressing.

54:24.824 --> 54:25.691
Yup.

54:26.893 --> 54:29.161
Let's party, people.

54:29.195 --> 54:32.064
First, I have a few house rules.

54:32.098 --> 54:33.733
You do whatever you want,
whenever you want

54:33.766 --> 54:35.968
to freaking do it, okay.

54:36.002 --> 54:37.203
No questions asked.

54:37.236 --> 54:40.206
No permission
is ever necessary.

54:40.239 --> 54:42.842
You break something,
you freaking buy it, okay.

54:42.875 --> 54:43.943
Or just hide it really well.

54:43.976 --> 54:45.577
That's true.

54:45.610 --> 54:47.612
Fuck the world, we're having a
great-ass time.

54:47.647 --> 54:50.582
We are alive
and we are thriving.

54:50.615 --> 54:52.685
Let's take a freaking shot
to that.

54:53.853 --> 54:54.954
Yeah, let's go.

54:55.955 --> 54:56.856
Sounds good.

54:56.889 --> 54:58.157
Yes!

56:15.701 --> 56:16.936
Fuck.

56:37.223 --> 56:38.791
Uh, you want a roughing?

56:38.824 --> 56:39.692
Yeah, baby.

56:39.725 --> 56:40.659
Yeah.

56:40.693 --> 56:42.094
Just keep looking sexy.

56:42.128 --> 56:43.696
Let's get this off.

57:16.395 --> 57:17.329
Boo!

57:17.363 --> 57:19.165
Jesus Christ!

57:19.198 --> 57:21.333
Jesus, oh my God.

57:21.367 --> 57:23.803
I just wanted to have
a little fun with you.

57:23.836 --> 57:26.038
Why the hell do you people
keep doing that?

57:26.806 --> 57:28.808
I'm sorry,
I'm just screwing around.

57:29.875 --> 57:30.910
It's not funny.

57:30.943 --> 57:32.678
And neither was this afternoon.

57:32.711 --> 57:34.380
Look, I know
you're into weird shit

57:34.413 --> 57:35.848
and everything like that.

57:35.881 --> 57:38.050
But it's really
not working for me.

57:38.084 --> 57:39.351
I honestly think that
I should just go home.

57:39.385 --> 57:40.853
No, no, no, no.

57:40.886 --> 57:42.321
Don't do that.

57:42.354 --> 57:44.123
Let me make it up to you.

57:46.158 --> 57:47.059
Tina.

57:50.796 --> 57:52.198
What are you doing?

57:56.869 --> 57:57.736
Tina, come on.

58:01.040 --> 58:01.974
I can't.

58:02.007 --> 58:03.742
You already are.

58:07.746 --> 58:11.383
Look, I'm sorry, I... I...
I... I really can't do this.

58:11.417 --> 58:12.985
You can't do what?

58:13.018 --> 58:15.020
I'm going back to bed, okay.

58:15.054 --> 58:16.689
And it's alone.

58:16.722 --> 58:17.790
No.

58:17.823 --> 58:19.191
I'm sorry.

58:37.743 --> 58:40.679
Hey, hey, sorry uh,
sorry to bug you,

58:40.713 --> 58:42.114
you're the maintenance guy,
right?

58:42.148 --> 58:44.450
Yeah, do I know you?

58:44.483 --> 58:46.919
Oh yeah, yeah,
I'm a... well, not personally,

58:46.952 --> 58:48.721
but I'm up with the kids
at the house

58:48.754 --> 58:50.356
at the party, yeah.

58:50.389 --> 58:52.691
I locked myself out,
they're in there

58:52.725 --> 58:54.827
blasting the music partying
and I'm banging on the door,

58:54.860 --> 58:56.061
nobody can hear me.

58:56.095 --> 58:57.296
Do you have like a spare key

58:57.329 --> 58:58.831
or anyway I can get
in the house?

58:58.864 --> 59:00.366
It's 4:00 a.m.
and I'm off duty.

59:00.399 --> 59:01.867
So, no.

59:03.502 --> 59:05.037
Yeah, it did get late, huh.

59:05.070 --> 59:06.472
Um...

59:06.505 --> 59:09.942
Hey, I'm... I'm... I'm so
embarrassed uh to bug you

59:09.975 --> 59:12.711
but there's no garage code
or anyway I can get in?

59:12.745 --> 59:14.013
I can't do that.

59:15.281 --> 59:16.482
All right.

59:16.515 --> 59:18.884
Well, I'm... I'm sorry
to bug you,

59:18.918 --> 59:23.055
I'll let you get back
to your thing

59:23.088 --> 59:25.257
and but you... you might hear
from me again,

59:25.291 --> 59:27.426
because I'm gonna try and bang
on the door louder,

59:27.459 --> 59:29.895
but if they don't hear me,

59:29.929 --> 59:31.797
I'll have to come back
and uh...

59:32.898 --> 59:35.100
Here, I'll give you
the heads up.

59:40.372 --> 59:42.741
Oh, what's that?

59:42.775 --> 59:44.243
Oh, you do have a key.

59:45.211 --> 59:47.279
Oh, and I can use it.

59:47.313 --> 59:50.182
Oh, you're such a lifesaver,
thank you so much.

59:50.216 --> 59:52.284
Thank you so much, brother.

59:52.318 --> 59:54.453
Come on, wake up.

59:54.486 --> 59:55.988
Oh God.

59:58.090 --> 1:00:00.426
Okay.

1:00:00.459 --> 1:00:01.961
You ready?

1:00:01.994 --> 1:00:02.895
Here we go.

1:00:15.908 --> 1:00:17.343
Hey Javon, it's me.

1:00:17.376 --> 1:00:18.444
I got real shitty service
up here,

1:00:18.477 --> 1:00:20.279
so we may get cut off.

1:00:20.312 --> 1:00:22.047
<i>What time is it?</i>

1:00:22.081 --> 1:00:24.149
It's late or early.

1:00:26.485 --> 1:00:28.187
You know, you're right.

1:00:28.220 --> 1:00:30.022
I shouldn't have
come up here.

1:00:30.055 --> 1:00:31.457
<i>I told you.</i>

1:00:31.490 --> 1:00:33.392
Do you think you could
come get me?

1:00:33.425 --> 1:00:34.526
<i>What's wrong?</i>

1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:36.095
Nothing.

1:00:36.128 --> 1:00:39.064
I just... I really just want
to come home.

1:00:39.098 --> 1:00:41.133
<i>Okay, I'll be
there tomorrow.</i>

1:00:41.166 --> 1:00:43.035
Thanks, I appreciate that.

1:01:15.934 --> 1:01:17.169
I'm going back
to the station.

1:01:17.202 --> 1:01:19.104
I'll get these pictures
to you soon or...

1:01:19.138 --> 1:01:20.906
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay, thanks.

1:01:20.939 --> 1:01:23.242
- One was there.
- Mhmm.

1:01:23.275 --> 1:01:24.910
He was a corrections officer?

1:01:24.943 --> 1:01:27.046
Yeah, one of the two guys
holding Tocho.

1:01:29.515 --> 1:01:32.518
Oh Price, I told you not to
get mixed up in this shit.

1:01:32.551 --> 1:01:33.452
Patrol's out.

1:01:33.485 --> 1:01:34.620
We'll find him.

1:01:36.021 --> 1:01:37.589
Well, thanks, partner.

1:01:37.623 --> 1:01:39.358
Tocho forced the van
off the road

1:01:39.391 --> 1:01:40.926
during the transfer.

1:01:40.959 --> 1:01:43.262
We found him tied to a tree
off of Exit 4.

1:01:43.295 --> 1:01:45.431
He's alive but he's beaten up
pretty bad.

1:01:45.464 --> 1:01:46.398
What was his name?

1:01:46.432 --> 1:01:47.299
The partner?

1:01:47.333 --> 1:01:48.600
Yeah.

1:01:48.635 --> 1:01:52.004
Blackhawk,
well, he goes by Horton now.

1:01:52.037 --> 1:01:53.405
Wampanoag tribe?

1:01:53.439 --> 1:01:55.941
I think so.

1:01:55.974 --> 1:01:58.277
Tocho knew to come to this
apartment right here.

1:01:58.310 --> 1:01:59.445
He murdered a cop,

1:01:59.478 --> 1:02:01.513
he killed his own
fucking dog.

1:02:01.547 --> 1:02:03.215
You really think he'd have left
any witnesses?

1:02:04.149 --> 1:02:05.150
No.

1:02:05.184 --> 1:02:06.151
Thanks.

1:02:34.480 --> 1:02:36.215
Well, hello, sleeping beauty.

1:02:36.248 --> 1:02:37.116
Morning.

1:02:38.250 --> 1:02:39.184
What?

1:02:39.218 --> 1:02:40.519
Morning ended a while ago.

1:02:40.552 --> 1:02:43.188
Sunset's in like three hours.

1:02:43.222 --> 1:02:44.957
Yeah, you've been sleeping
all day.

1:02:44.990 --> 1:02:46.258
What?

1:02:46.291 --> 1:02:47.393
Usually Greene wakes
everyone at dawn

1:02:47.426 --> 1:02:49.962
with his fucking leaf blower,

1:02:49.995 --> 1:02:52.264
but haven't seen his sorry ass
all day.

1:02:52.297 --> 1:02:53.365
Guess we finally scared
him off?

1:02:55.100 --> 1:02:57.035
I thought you guys were gonna
try to work it out.

1:02:57.069 --> 1:03:00.005
I guess he came to his
senses and decided to leave.

1:03:00.038 --> 1:03:01.974
It's better this way,
trust me.

1:03:02.007 --> 1:03:03.475
Uh yeah,
actually I think I'm gonna do

1:03:03.509 --> 1:03:05.611
the same and head out.

1:03:05.645 --> 1:03:07.045
My friend's coming to
pick me up tonight.

1:03:07.379 --> 1:03:08.648
Wait, wait.

1:03:08.681 --> 1:03:10.249
Why?

1:03:10.282 --> 1:03:11.950
I honestly just don't think
I'm in the mood

1:03:11.984 --> 1:03:13.385
for everything and I don't want
to ruin the party.

1:03:13.419 --> 1:03:14.721
You guys are having
so much fun.

1:03:14.754 --> 1:03:19.491
Hey, hey,
that's what we're here for.

1:03:19.525 --> 1:03:21.493
I know I haven't been making
you feel as comfortable

1:03:21.527 --> 1:03:24.129
as I wanted, but...

1:03:24.163 --> 1:03:25.230
It's... it's not that.

1:03:25.264 --> 1:03:27.266
I just...

1:03:27.299 --> 1:03:28.267
I... I really just think
I should go.

1:03:28.300 --> 1:03:29.168
No, no.

1:03:29.201 --> 1:03:30.202
No buts.

1:03:30.235 --> 1:03:31.704
I made you a drink.

1:03:31.738 --> 1:03:34.540
Zack, Zack.

1:03:38.610 --> 1:03:39.511
To life.

1:03:39.545 --> 1:03:41.046
To life.

1:03:46.218 --> 1:03:48.020
Well, we could at least
have some fun

1:03:48.053 --> 1:03:49.221
till your friend comes.

1:03:53.292 --> 1:03:55.127
- Cheers.
- Yes.

1:03:58.030 --> 1:03:59.198
It's gonna be a good weekend.

1:03:59.231 --> 1:04:00.999
Look what I got.

1:04:02.401 --> 1:04:04.536
- Will you light this for me?
- Of course.

1:04:04.570 --> 1:04:06.572
What the hell is that?

1:04:11.276 --> 1:04:12.511
You want some of that?

1:04:13.746 --> 1:04:15.414
Take it while it's hot.

1:04:17.149 --> 1:04:18.183
Hey, be careful with that stuff
though.

1:04:18.217 --> 1:04:19.351
It's really strong.

1:04:21.353 --> 1:04:23.055
I'm serious, take it easy.

1:04:23.088 --> 1:04:24.089
Hey, come on,
let me get some, man.

1:04:24.122 --> 1:04:25.057
My turn.

1:04:34.333 --> 1:04:36.669
Sonja, what's a secret you've
never told anyone before?

1:04:36.703 --> 1:04:41.674
Hmm, I cheated on Spencer.

1:04:41.708 --> 1:04:43.810
Wait, what?

1:04:43.843 --> 1:04:44.711
With Zack.

1:04:45.778 --> 1:04:46.713
Here.

1:04:47.613 --> 1:04:48.815
Two weeks ago.

1:04:48.848 --> 1:04:49.548
Are you fucking serious
right now?

1:04:49.581 --> 1:04:50.549
No.

1:04:50.582 --> 1:04:52.351
I think it's kind of hot.

1:04:52.384 --> 1:04:53.285
Sonja?

1:04:55.521 --> 1:04:56.555
No, I'm just fucking
with you.

1:04:56.588 --> 1:04:57.657
Oh my God.

1:04:59.091 --> 1:05:00.592
That shit's not funny.

1:05:00.626 --> 1:05:02.060
Okay, okay, okay.

1:05:02.094 --> 1:05:03.328
Adrianna, it's your turn.

1:05:04.831 --> 1:05:08.567
You have to take a hit of that
first though.

1:05:08.600 --> 1:05:10.469
And Adrianna,
don't be a buzzkill.

1:05:10.502 --> 1:05:11.638
Be nice.

1:05:11.671 --> 1:05:13.071
She's always a buzzkill.

1:05:15.775 --> 1:05:17.710
Whoa, fuck you, Zack.

1:05:19.344 --> 1:05:21.113
What else?

1:05:21.146 --> 1:05:26.552
Tina, tell me, what is your
most secret sexual fantasy?

1:05:26.585 --> 1:05:28.755
I'm not sure I have any
that are left.

1:05:29.889 --> 1:05:32.190
Aah, you're welcome.

1:05:32.224 --> 1:05:34.059
Yeah, too boring for you,
you know what's up.

1:05:35.695 --> 1:05:39.799
You see I like to live life
on the edge.

1:05:39.832 --> 1:05:41.266
Sex is like life,

1:05:41.300 --> 1:05:43.268
without a little bit of danger,

1:05:43.302 --> 1:05:44.403
you might as well be dead.

1:05:44.436 --> 1:05:45.872
Want some danger, baby?

1:05:45.905 --> 1:05:47.406
Hmm.

1:05:49.575 --> 1:05:51.343
I want some danger.

1:05:58.250 --> 1:06:00.385
Fuck this.

1:06:00.419 --> 1:06:01.688
Fuck your ass.

1:06:01.721 --> 1:06:02.789
Fuck them!

1:06:48.333 --> 1:06:49.267
Good.

1:06:54.272 --> 1:06:56.241
Get me Adrianna.

1:06:56.274 --> 1:06:58.711
Do what you want
with the others

1:06:58.745 --> 1:06:59.912
but bring me the girl.

1:06:59.946 --> 1:07:01.279
- Yes, Chief.
- Alive!

1:07:01.313 --> 1:07:02.547
She's mine!

1:07:04.249 --> 1:07:06.451
I... I... I don't know
who I am.

1:07:06.485 --> 1:07:09.254
But you do remember
what you did?

1:07:10.555 --> 1:07:11.556
No?

1:07:11.590 --> 1:07:12.524
I think you do.

1:07:12.557 --> 1:07:14.661
Just say it.

1:07:14.694 --> 1:07:17.329
I... I can't.

1:07:17.362 --> 1:07:20.767
I'm gonna give you 60 seconds
to get your story straight.

1:07:22.935 --> 1:07:24.637
Walsh.

1:07:24.671 --> 1:07:25.872
<i>I checked the
number you gave me.</i>

1:07:25.905 --> 1:07:28.407
Yeah, and go ahead.

1:07:28.440 --> 1:07:31.610
<i>4115 Redwood
Circle, Black Raven.</i>

1:07:31.644 --> 1:07:33.478
Black Raven.

1:07:33.512 --> 1:07:34.781
Thanks, Donna.

1:07:34.814 --> 1:07:35.748
<i>Sure thing.</i>

1:07:35.782 --> 1:07:36.749
<i>She's a popular girl.</i>

1:07:36.783 --> 1:07:38.383
How do you mean?

1:07:38.417 --> 1:07:39.351
<i>You're the
second cop</i>

1:07:39.384 --> 1:07:39.919
<i>looking for her today.</i>

1:07:42.655 --> 1:07:43.923
Flanagan?

1:07:43.956 --> 1:07:44.991
<i>You got it.</i>

1:07:45.024 --> 1:07:46.358
<i>Called late this afternoon.</i>

1:08:09.514 --> 1:08:10.582
Bullshit.

1:09:02.567 --> 1:09:03.502
Ah!

1:09:54.586 --> 1:09:58.124
Ah, '84.

1:09:58.157 --> 1:10:01.127
A fine year.

1:10:01.160 --> 1:10:05.031
Good vintage indeed.

1:10:21.647 --> 1:10:23.983
Okay, okay, Tina.

1:10:25.617 --> 1:10:26.686
Your turn.

1:10:26.719 --> 1:10:27.720
Okay.

1:10:27.753 --> 1:10:28.721
Ask a question.

1:10:29.554 --> 1:10:30.756
Adrianna.

1:10:30.790 --> 1:10:31.958
Tina...

1:10:33.125 --> 1:10:34.593
What's your biggest fear?

1:10:34.626 --> 1:10:36.062
That my memories won't fade.

1:10:36.095 --> 1:10:38.130
Oh, that's dark.

1:10:38.164 --> 1:10:42.168
Well, that's why we make
new ones.

1:10:42.201 --> 1:10:44.637
Come on, baby, I want you
so fucking bad right now.

1:10:44.670 --> 1:10:46.806
You better take care
of your man, Tina

1:10:46.839 --> 1:10:48.975
or I might just have to.

1:10:49.008 --> 1:10:51.944
This will literally take
two seconds.

1:10:51.978 --> 1:10:52.912
That happened one time.

1:10:52.945 --> 1:10:54.680
It happens every time.

1:10:54.714 --> 1:10:55.915
It's your fault.

1:10:58.718 --> 1:11:00.052
Seems so whipped,
it's ridiculous

1:11:00.086 --> 1:11:02.088
So whipped.

1:11:16.168 --> 1:11:17.036
Go make me a drink, baby.

1:11:20.973 --> 1:11:21.874
No, I'm not kidding,

1:11:21.908 --> 1:11:22.708
go make me a margarita.

1:11:22.742 --> 1:11:24.176
Later, baby.

1:11:24.210 --> 1:11:25.745
No, I'm not having
sex with you

1:11:25.778 --> 1:11:27.680
unless you make me
a margarita.

1:11:27.713 --> 1:11:28.848
What?

1:11:28.881 --> 1:11:30.016
Really?

1:11:30.049 --> 1:11:31.217
You're not gonna have sex
with me

1:11:31.250 --> 1:11:33.019
if I don't make you
a margarita?

1:11:33.052 --> 1:11:34.053
Yeah.

1:11:39.258 --> 1:11:40.726
I'll be right back.

1:11:49.669 --> 1:11:51.469
What took you so long?

1:12:07.552 --> 1:12:11.589
Wait, put the mask on.

1:12:17.863 --> 1:12:19.632
Yeah.

1:12:31.777 --> 1:12:33.713
Are you afraid?

1:12:33.746 --> 1:12:34.947
So afraid.

1:12:39.018 --> 1:12:41.153
Margaritas.

1:12:43.089 --> 1:12:46.659
Fuck, so stupid.

1:12:52.031 --> 1:12:53.565
I bet you.

1:12:54.333 --> 1:12:56.235
Aha.

1:12:56.268 --> 1:12:57.703
Nice.

1:12:57.737 --> 1:12:59.071
I'm gettin' laid.

1:12:59.105 --> 1:13:00.505
Haha.

1:13:05.811 --> 1:13:07.113
Mr. Greene?

1:13:07.146 --> 1:13:09.281
Oh, come on, man,
are you drunk again?

1:13:09.315 --> 1:13:11.884
Seriously man, bad timing.

1:13:11.917 --> 1:13:13.986
You were the biggest cock block
I have ever met.

1:13:14.020 --> 1:13:15.321
Come on, man, let's go.

1:13:15.354 --> 1:13:18.824
Hey, Mr. Greene,
come on.

1:13:18.858 --> 1:13:20.059
Oh fuck!

1:13:20.092 --> 1:13:21.761
Oh shit.

1:13:21.794 --> 1:13:22.762
Oh, fuck this!

1:13:22.795 --> 1:13:23.963
Oh fuck.

1:13:25.197 --> 1:13:28.067
Hey, can I ask you something?

1:13:28.100 --> 1:13:29.001
Sure.

1:13:29.035 --> 1:13:30.236
How do you know Tina?

1:13:30.269 --> 1:13:31.603
College.

1:13:31.637 --> 1:13:33.272
Same sorority.

1:13:33.305 --> 1:13:34.974
Has she always been so...

1:13:35.007 --> 1:13:36.709
Nuts?

1:13:36.742 --> 1:13:38.677
I was gonna say more like...

1:13:38.711 --> 1:13:40.079
You can say it.

1:13:40.112 --> 1:13:43.282
You're not wrong,
she's harmless.

1:13:43.315 --> 1:13:44.884
Just likes to have
a good time.

1:13:44.917 --> 1:13:45.918
Yeah.

1:13:45.951 --> 1:13:47.787
I'm starting to get that now.

1:13:47.820 --> 1:13:49.955
What about you?

1:13:49.989 --> 1:13:51.757
Having fun?

1:13:51.791 --> 1:13:53.292
I know we kind of
blindsided you.

1:13:53.325 --> 1:13:54.894
Yeah, I mine it's fine.

1:13:54.927 --> 1:13:57.997
I just, kind of needed some
time to adjust.

1:13:58.030 --> 1:14:00.766
Listen I'm gonna take a few
more minutes in here,

1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:02.134
but let's chat later.

1:14:02.168 --> 1:14:03.102
Okay.

1:14:03.135 --> 1:14:04.602
I'll see you inside.

1:14:18.918 --> 1:14:20.753
Tina!

1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:22.755
Zack, hey.

1:14:22.788 --> 1:14:23.856
Hey, what's going on?

1:14:23.889 --> 1:14:26.192
I don't... Mr. Greene's dead.

1:14:26.225 --> 1:14:27.293
Dead? What the hell
do you mean?

1:14:27.326 --> 1:14:28.661
I don't know either.

1:14:28.694 --> 1:14:29.627
What the hell was that?

1:14:29.662 --> 1:14:30.863
What's going on?

1:14:30.896 --> 1:14:31.864
I don't know, I'm trying to
make...

1:14:31.897 --> 1:14:33.065
What the hell is going on, guys?

1:14:33.099 --> 1:14:34.033
Adrianna!

1:14:34.066 --> 1:14:35.267
Javon!

1:14:35.301 --> 1:14:36.335
- What the fuck is going on?
- Oh shit.

1:14:37.336 --> 1:14:38.237
No, no, no.

1:14:38.270 --> 1:14:39.738
That's not him!

1:14:39.772 --> 1:14:40.639
- What are you doing?
- That's my friend!

1:14:40.673 --> 1:14:41.907
Get off me!

1:14:41.941 --> 1:14:42.775
- Get the fuck off!
- That's my friend!

1:14:42.808 --> 1:14:44.110
What the fuck, bro!

1:14:44.143 --> 1:14:44.877
You just attacked my girl,
motherfucker.

1:14:44.910 --> 1:14:45.878
No, I didn't.

1:14:45.911 --> 1:14:46.846
What are you talking about?

1:14:46.879 --> 1:14:48.681
Javon, what are you doing?

1:14:48.714 --> 1:14:50.049
What are you talking
about? I came to pick you up.

1:14:50.082 --> 1:14:51.217
I just saw the mask.
Where did you put it?

1:14:51.250 --> 1:14:52.418
- What?
- The mask you made.

1:14:52.451 --> 1:14:53.752
Where did you put it?

1:14:53.786 --> 1:14:55.387
Y'all are tripping.

1:14:55.421 --> 1:14:57.156
I left that shit
at the restaurant.

1:14:57.189 --> 1:14:58.858
Then what the hell
are you doing here, man?

1:14:58.891 --> 1:15:00.860
I came to pick up Adrianna.

1:15:00.893 --> 1:15:03.262
Listen, whatever is going on,
whatever you think I did,

1:15:03.295 --> 1:15:04.864
I didn't do.

1:15:04.897 --> 1:15:06.899
Then who did it?

1:15:06.932 --> 1:15:08.200
Johnny Discenzo.

1:15:08.234 --> 1:15:10.102
My ex-boyfriend.

1:15:10.136 --> 1:15:12.037
Well, ex-fuck buddy.

1:15:12.071 --> 1:15:13.072
What?

1:15:13.105 --> 1:15:14.440
How did he know you were here?

1:15:14.473 --> 1:15:15.841
I invited him.

1:15:15.875 --> 1:15:17.943
Are you kidding me?

1:15:17.977 --> 1:15:20.679
I wanted to spice things up,
create a little adventure.

1:15:20.713 --> 1:15:22.781
For our special guest here.

1:15:22.815 --> 1:15:24.750
What does that even mean, Tina?

1:15:24.783 --> 1:15:27.286
I thought it'd be dope
to recreate Liberty Manor.

1:15:28.287 --> 1:15:30.389
This is not some
kind of fucking game.

1:15:30.422 --> 1:15:32.391
Life's a game, sweetie.

1:15:32.424 --> 1:15:33.392
You slept with him,
didn't you?

1:15:33.425 --> 1:15:35.828
That fucking low-life!

1:15:35.861 --> 1:15:37.263
You kept saying you wanted
to watch,

1:15:37.296 --> 1:15:38.797
what is the big deal?

1:15:38.831 --> 1:15:40.933
Okay, this is way too much
for me right now.

1:15:40.966 --> 1:15:43.369
That guy Greene is fucking
dead, because of you.

1:15:43.402 --> 1:15:45.938
Mr. Greene is a loser
with no family, no friends,

1:15:45.971 --> 1:15:47.006
and no life.

1:15:47.039 --> 1:15:48.807
Nobody will miss him.

1:15:48.841 --> 1:15:51.377
How the hell can you even
say that?

1:15:51.410 --> 1:15:53.012
It's true.

1:15:53.045 --> 1:15:54.380
So what are you gonna say
that it's me next

1:15:54.413 --> 1:15:57.183
or Zack or Spencer or...

1:15:57.216 --> 1:16:01.020
You guys, where's Spencer?

1:16:01.053 --> 1:16:03.289
You guys, who is Spencer?

1:16:08.093 --> 1:16:10.095
What you're doing
is sacrilege.

1:16:11.797 --> 1:16:13.766
Oh, the... the mask,
this is uh...

1:16:13.799 --> 1:16:15.234
no, this is a... it is a toy.

1:16:15.267 --> 1:16:16.969
I got this
at a Halloween's store.

1:16:17.002 --> 1:16:18.137
Yeah, yeah, look, look, look,
it's made of plastic.

1:16:18.170 --> 1:16:19.004
It's not even real.

1:16:21.006 --> 1:16:21.907
Oh shit.

1:16:37.890 --> 1:16:40.392
She's not answering.

1:16:40.426 --> 1:16:42.528
Tocho's making a play
for Adrianna,

1:16:42.561 --> 1:16:44.863
Morgan, I can feel it.

1:16:44.897 --> 1:16:47.132
Yeah, look, we just got to get
there first,

1:16:47.166 --> 1:16:48.767
okay.

1:16:48.801 --> 1:16:50.269
Yeah.

1:16:50.302 --> 1:16:51.237
Fuck.

1:17:25.204 --> 1:17:27.806
Spencer.

1:17:27.840 --> 1:17:30.776
Just wanted to come back,
right, just say something.

1:18:03.175 --> 1:18:05.344
Oh my God, what the fuck!

1:18:05.377 --> 1:18:06.478
How did we miss this?

1:18:06.512 --> 1:18:08.981
Oh my God, Javon!

1:18:09.014 --> 1:18:10.082
Gross.

1:18:10.115 --> 1:18:12.418
Adrianna,
what the fuck is it?

1:18:12.451 --> 1:18:13.519
What the hell do you think
is happening,

1:18:13.552 --> 1:18:14.953
you crazy bitch!

1:18:14.987 --> 1:18:15.487
You wanted Liberty Manor,
you got it.

1:18:15.521 --> 1:18:16.922
No.

1:18:16.955 --> 1:18:17.856
Everyone get a hold of this.

1:18:17.890 --> 1:18:19.291
This is all your fault.

1:18:19.325 --> 1:18:20.893
I can't even, what the fuck is
wrong with you?

1:18:20.926 --> 1:18:22.528
I did not want this
to happen.

1:18:22.561 --> 1:18:24.096
The hell did you think
was gonna happen?

1:18:24.129 --> 1:18:25.197
I just wanted to have
a fun weekend

1:18:25.230 --> 1:18:26.432
with my friends.

1:18:26.465 --> 1:18:28.000
- You think this is fun?
- No.

1:18:28.033 --> 1:18:29.501
You know what?
I'm outta here.

1:18:29.535 --> 1:18:30.869
My friends are dying.

1:18:30.903 --> 1:18:32.204
No, you can't leave me.

1:18:32.237 --> 1:18:33.172
I'm not gonna take that shit
laying down.

1:18:33.205 --> 1:18:34.139
Zack, where are you going?

1:18:34.173 --> 1:18:35.374
Zack, no!

1:18:35.407 --> 1:18:36.408
Zack, no.

1:18:36.442 --> 1:18:37.644
What did I do?

1:18:59.164 --> 1:19:01.533
Hey Morgan,
I just found Adrianna's car.

1:19:01.567 --> 1:19:03.035
Yeah, Adrianna's car.

1:19:03.068 --> 1:19:06.238
She's here at um,
Morgan?

1:19:08.374 --> 1:19:09.575
Morgan?

1:19:10.275 --> 1:19:11.577
Fuck!

1:20:51.376 --> 1:20:52.611
Zack, Zack, Zack?

1:21:04.156 --> 1:21:05.290
No.

1:21:05.324 --> 1:21:06.258
Fuck!

1:21:08.160 --> 1:21:09.361
Zack, oh my God.

1:21:09.394 --> 1:21:10.763
Thank God.

1:21:10.797 --> 1:21:12.030
I got him.

1:21:12.064 --> 1:21:13.465
Thank God.

1:21:13.499 --> 1:21:15.100
But he got me, too.

1:21:15.133 --> 1:21:15.802
What?

1:21:15.835 --> 1:21:17.069
No, no, no.

1:21:17.102 --> 1:21:17.770
Oh my God, Zack,
no, no, no.

1:21:17.804 --> 1:21:18.705
Zack!

1:21:20.072 --> 1:21:21.473
No, don't touch me!

1:21:21.507 --> 1:21:23.308
Time for you to pay.

1:21:23.342 --> 1:21:26.044
You think you can slay
a great nation of warriors.

1:21:26.078 --> 1:21:27.446
And just walk away?

1:21:27.479 --> 1:21:29.448
No, I don't think so.

1:21:29.481 --> 1:21:30.349
You're a coward!

1:21:30.382 --> 1:21:32.284
You and the Chief.

1:21:32.317 --> 1:21:33.653
It was never
about the ring, was it?

1:21:33.686 --> 1:21:35.621
Does it satisfy
your blood lust?

1:21:35.655 --> 1:21:37.055
Well, if it's blood
you want...

1:21:39.324 --> 1:21:41.059
- Javon!
- Run, Adrianna.

1:21:42.427 --> 1:21:43.262
Javon.

1:21:43.295 --> 1:21:45.130
No.

1:21:45.163 --> 1:21:46.265
No, no.

1:21:48.600 --> 1:21:49.568
Adrianna!

1:22:04.817 --> 1:22:06.251
Stay calm,
just drop the weapon

1:22:06.285 --> 1:22:07.619
or I'll blow your brains out.

1:22:07.654 --> 1:22:08.620
Drop the weapon.

1:22:08.655 --> 1:22:10.122
Drop the weapon.

1:22:11.824 --> 1:22:13.091
Now don't move,
right there.

1:22:14.694 --> 1:22:16.428
Where's Tocho and his goons?

1:22:16.461 --> 1:22:17.596
Start talking to me right now
or I'll blow your heart

1:22:17.629 --> 1:22:18.665
out of your chest.

1:22:18.698 --> 1:22:19.732
Don't think so.

1:22:19.766 --> 1:22:21.099
Really?

1:22:21.133 --> 1:22:21.834
You don't think so.

1:22:24.570 --> 1:22:26.204
Don't you wish you had,
you dead bitch.

1:22:40.653 --> 1:22:41.654
Oh my God, oh my God.

1:22:41.688 --> 1:22:43.288
She's dead, she's dead.

1:22:46.291 --> 1:22:47.326
We have to go.

1:22:47.359 --> 1:22:48.661
Let's go!

1:23:04.644 --> 1:23:05.611
Kitchi!

1:23:12.184 --> 1:23:12.885
Get over here.

1:23:14.887 --> 1:23:16.388
Don't touch me.

1:23:20.626 --> 1:23:21.526
Don't let her get away.

1:23:21.560 --> 1:23:22.394
No!

1:23:22.427 --> 1:23:23.362
No!

1:23:23.395 --> 1:23:24.329
Don't touch me.

1:23:24.363 --> 1:23:25.364
No!

1:23:25.397 --> 1:23:26.498
No!

1:23:26.531 --> 1:23:27.800
Get off of me!

1:23:27.834 --> 1:23:28.901
Get off of me!

1:23:28.935 --> 1:23:30.637
Get off!

1:23:32.571 --> 1:23:34.439
No.

1:23:34.473 --> 1:23:35.842
Fucking die,
you fucking bitch.

1:24:02.769 --> 1:24:04.737
Adrianna!

1:24:04.771 --> 1:24:06.304
Adrianna, where are you?

1:24:16.749 --> 1:24:21.253
Relish these few moments
of peace, Adrianna.

1:24:21.286 --> 1:24:24.657
I have exacted my revenge.

1:24:24.691 --> 1:24:26.224
Does that mean it's over?

1:24:26.258 --> 1:24:28.627
Can you predict the future?

1:24:28.661 --> 1:24:31.698
Can you separate the future
from the past?

1:24:31.731 --> 1:24:33.365
Is it over?

1:24:33.398 --> 1:24:38.303
Today is over, my child.

1:24:38.336 --> 1:24:41.239
But tomorrow,
it's just begun.

1:24:56.521 --> 1:24:57.456
Adrianna?

1:24:57.489 --> 1:24:58.390
Here.

1:24:58.423 --> 1:24:59.726
Here, right here.

1:24:59.759 --> 1:25:00.893
I'm here.

1:25:03.663 --> 1:25:06.364
It's over.

1:25:06.398 --> 1:25:07.734
It's over.

1:25:10.837 --> 1:25:12.370
It's over, it's over.

1:25:16.876 --> 1:25:19.045
It's over, shh.

1:25:23.950 --> 1:25:25.918
It's over.

1:25:29.689 --> 1:25:31.323
I got you now, it's over
honey, it's over.

1:25:33.558 --> 1:25:34.861
It's over.

1:25:38.798 --> 1:25:40.066
It's over, okay.

1:25:40.099 --> 1:25:41.934
Come now, shh.

1:25:47.506 --> 1:25:50.676
My people have long said

1:25:50.710 --> 1:25:53.311
that when you seek revenge

1:25:53.345 --> 1:25:55.748
you should first dig two graves.

1:26:06.025 --> 1:26:08.995
but there is honor in death.

1:26:19.604 --> 1:26:22.909
And we derive strenght till we
the defeat

1:26:22.942 --> 1:26:24.476
of our enemies.

1:26:42.061 --> 1:26:44.362
As our enemies are all around us

1:26:45.164 --> 1:26:46.766
to give in...

1:26:46.799 --> 1:26:47.700
to conform...

1:26:48.935 --> 1:26:50.502
to capitulate.

1:26:57.677 --> 1:27:00.146
But there is no honor in that.

1:27:11.523 --> 1:27:13.458
And for the weak

1:27:13.491 --> 1:27:15.761
even death

1:27:15.795 --> 1:27:17.864
could not bring
a peaceful sleep.

1:27:31.010 --> 1:27:33.511
The future is calling
some of us.

1:27:57.703 --> 1:27:58.838
But death...

1:28:02.642 --> 1:28:05.443
is waiting for all of us.
