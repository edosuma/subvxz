when I first met chef Ramsay,

03:50.747 --> 03:53.082
I told him I wanted
to work with him so bad

03:53.083 --> 03:55.684
that I would shave my head.

03:55.685 --> 03:57.286

how I'm gonna test
your commitment.

I couldn't think of a better way

to make the same commitment.

07:52.355 --> 07:53.422
We could always put a tray.

07:53.423 --> 07:54.656
[Chuckling]

07:54.657 --> 07:56.158
20 minutes to go, ladies.

07:56.159 --> 07:57.526
All right, ladies,
we gotta win this.

07:57.527 --> 07:58.527
<i>(Dana) What's burning?</i>

07:58.528 --> 07:59.495
Oh!
Just stomp it out.

07:59.496 --> 08:01.029
Not my new shoes!

08:01.030 --> 08:02.931
She said, "not my new shoes"?

08:02.932 --> 08:05.868
Yeah.
I'm from Memphis, Tennessee.

08:05.869 --> 08:08.437
A place called Nutbush.
It's the hood.

08:08.438 --> 08:10.639
Didn't go to all
the fine dining restaurants,

08:10.640 --> 08:13.075
but I worked my ass off
to be here.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.743
<i>20 seconds to go.</i>

08:14.744 --> 08:16.144
(Robyn)
Watch your back. Right behind.

08:16.145 --> 08:17.279
<i>'Scuse me, hot plate.</i>

08:17.280 --> 08:19.147
<i>(Gordon)
Five... Four...</i>

08:19.148 --> 08:22.217
<i>Three... Two...</i>

08:22.218 --> 08:24.386
<i>One... And stop.</i>

08:26.656 --> 08:28.891
(Announcer) The chefs'
willingness to cut their hair

08:28.892 --> 08:30.926
showed chef Ramsay
how committed they are

08:30.927 --> 08:32.693
<i>to being in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

08:32.695 --> 08:34.363
But he still has
a couple of matters

08:34.364 --> 08:35.797
to clear up.

08:35.798 --> 08:37.666
Now, you may have noticed
that the two people

08:37.667 --> 08:38.567
that had their heads shaven
were not cooking

08:38.568 --> 08:40.836
alongside you.

08:40.837 --> 08:42.804
They're Scott's friends.
Got it?

08:42.804 --> 08:44.072
Oh, my God.

08:44.073 --> 08:45.340
<i>Now, there's one more thing.</i>

08:45.341 --> 08:48.477
Andi...

08:48.478 --> 08:50.145
[Laughter]

08:50.146 --> 08:52.214
Okay.

08:52.215 --> 08:53.515
(Brian) Andi's hot with hair,

08:53.516 --> 08:54.716
and Andi is hot bald.

08:54.717 --> 08:57.619
And she's got an attitude,
which is, uh...

08:57.620 --> 08:59.388
Takes sexy
to a different level.

08:59.389 --> 09:01.990
Okay.

09:01.991 --> 09:03.225
<i>Right, listen.</i>

09:03.226 --> 09:04.826
I want all of you to understand

09:04.827 --> 09:07.162
<i>that this year's
Hell's Kitchen,</i>

09:07.163 --> 09:11.700
they're not just looking
for a unique head chef.

09:11.701 --> 09:13.936
<i>I'm looking...</i>

09:13.937 --> 09:16.605
for my head chef...

09:16.606 --> 09:20.943
at Gordon Ramsay Steak
at the Paris in Las Vegas.

09:20.944 --> 09:22.644
Holy [bleep].

09:22.645 --> 09:24.246
<i>(Chef Ramsay) That's right.</i>

09:24.247 --> 09:25.847
[Cheers and clapping] Yeah!

09:25.848 --> 09:27.583
That position comes
with a salary

09:27.584 --> 09:29.351
of $250,000.

09:29.352 --> 09:31.620
Working for chef Ramsay
is the cat's meow.

09:31.621 --> 09:32.888
[Cat meows]

09:32.889 --> 09:34.122
If you don't get excited
about that,

09:34.123 --> 09:34.957
you're dead inside.

09:34.958 --> 09:37.993
Let's start.

09:41.864 --> 09:43.298
First name.
Robyn.

09:43.299 --> 09:44.666
Robyn, from where?
Hollywood, Florida.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.168
What is it, please?

09:46.169 --> 09:48.403
Seared striped bass
over yellow romesco sauce.

09:48.404 --> 09:50.372
Visually, it's got the impact.

09:50.373 --> 09:52.441
<i>Thank you, chef.
The inspiration came from where?</i>

09:52.442 --> 09:54.710
I don't know, chef.
Just putting flavors together.

10:00.550 --> 10:02.317
<i>It's delicious.
Thank you, chef.</i>

10:02.318 --> 10:03.619
The sauce is delicious.
Seasoned perfectly.

10:03.620 --> 10:04.519
Thank you, chef.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.754
I am so stoked.

10:05.755 --> 10:07.990
That's like the best
orgasm ever.

10:07.991 --> 10:09.424
He loved it.

10:09.425 --> 10:10.425
First name is?

10:10.426 --> 10:11.727
<i>Don.
From where?</i>

10:11.728 --> 10:13.729
Houston, Texas.

10:13.730 --> 10:17.132
My signature dish
is going to knock his socks off.

10:17.133 --> 10:18.667
He's gonna declare me the winner
right then and there.

10:18.668 --> 10:19.801
What is it?

10:19.802 --> 10:21.737
This is a southwestern
saltimbocca.

10:21.738 --> 10:23.805
Yeah.
So I hope you'll enjoy it.

10:23.806 --> 10:25.040
Is that a portion for one?

10:25.041 --> 10:26.208
<i>Uh, yes.
Yeah.</i>

10:26.209 --> 10:27.609
<i>Yes.
This is one...</i>

10:27.610 --> 10:29.311
<i>Yes.
Big [bleep] portion.</i>

10:29.312 --> 10:30.746
<i>[Laughing] Yes. Yeah.</i>

10:30.747 --> 10:31.713
Everything's bigger in Texas,

10:31.714 --> 10:32.781
<i>especially the portions.</i>

10:32.782 --> 10:34.549
Okay.

10:36.953 --> 10:38.286
[Coughs]

10:38.287 --> 10:40.288
Taste the spice on there.

10:40.289 --> 10:41.723
How much cumin
did you put in there?

10:41.724 --> 10:42.891
Mm, about 1/2 teaspoon.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.660
<i>And that's not
too much for you?</i>

10:44.661 --> 10:46.128
<i>Mm-mm.
Do you need to spit that out?</i>

10:46.129 --> 10:47.529
<i>Mm... I want to.
Yeah, here's a bin here.</i>

10:47.530 --> 10:49.931
<i>Thank you, chef.
Trash.</i>

10:49.932 --> 10:52.801
[Spits]

10:52.802 --> 10:54.703
The spices are so powerful.

10:54.704 --> 10:56.972
<i>Back in line.
Ladies, congratulations.</i>

10:56.973 --> 10:58.507
One-nil.
Thank you, chef.

10:58.508 --> 11:00.809
Whoo! I'm so [bleep] excited
right now.

11:00.810 --> 11:02.444
Got the first point
for the ladies.

11:02.445 --> 11:04.046
Shake, shake, shake.

11:04.047 --> 11:05.514
<i>(Barbie) Good job, Robyn.
Yeah, Robyn.</i>

11:05.515 --> 11:06.748
[Coughs]

11:06.749 --> 11:08.050
<i>(Gordon) Let's go.</i>

11:08.051 --> 11:09.651
Next two.

11:09.652 --> 11:11.887
(Announcer) With Robyn giving
the women an early lead,

11:11.888 --> 11:13.555
sous chef Tiffany from Vermont

11:13.556 --> 11:14.856
is looking to keep up
the momentum

11:14.857 --> 11:16.692
as she faces off

11:16.693 --> 11:19.628
against an executive chef
from New York named Guy.

11:19.629 --> 11:21.496
First name is?
Tiffany.

11:21.497 --> 11:23.899
<i>By coming to Hell's Kitchen,
I'm trying to prove</i>

11:23.900 --> 11:25.467
that I'm not just
some dumb, ditzy blonde

11:25.468 --> 11:26.668
that looks really good.

11:26.669 --> 11:28.170
I have what it takes

11:28.171 --> 11:29.471
to be a professional
in this industry.

11:29.472 --> 11:30.472
What is it?

11:30.473 --> 11:32.007
I have a lamb schnitzel

11:32.008 --> 11:34.976
with a rosemary-maple-infused
lamb gloss.

11:34.977 --> 11:37.112
Just touch the top of it.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.314
It's like a wet diaper.

11:39.315 --> 11:40.882
So you make a lamb chop crispy.

11:40.883 --> 11:42.851
Then you dredge it in sauce.

11:42.852 --> 11:45.353
Um, I accidentally just kind of
poured the sauce over it

11:45.354 --> 11:47.155
<i>in a hurry.</i>

11:47.156 --> 11:48.957
I just don't understand
what goes through

11:48.958 --> 11:49.991
some of these blonde bitches'
heads.

11:49.992 --> 11:51.693
<i>I don't get it.
What a shame.</i>

11:51.694 --> 11:54.029
Disgusting.

11:54.030 --> 11:55.964
<i>[Coughs]</i>

11:55.965 --> 11:57.265
You okay?

11:57.266 --> 11:58.600
Yeah, I'm good.

11:58.601 --> 11:59.935
Okay, first name is?

11:59.936 --> 12:01.503
Guy.
Guy, and you're from where?

12:01.504 --> 12:02.671
I was born in Israel.

12:02.672 --> 12:04.339
<i>In Israel.
Yeah.</i>

12:04.340 --> 12:06.108
In Israel,
I was a drill sergeant.

12:06.109 --> 12:08.477
I served in the infantry
for three years.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.011
It's gonna take a lot
to break me.

12:10.012 --> 12:11.546
Okay, what is it, Guy?

12:11.547 --> 12:13.014
<i>First, it didn't come out
the way I wanted.</i>

12:13.015 --> 12:15.350
The sauce got burned.

12:15.351 --> 12:18.320
It's a pan-seared striped bass
with a chocolate miso sauce.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.321
Chocolate miso?

12:19.322 --> 12:20.322
Mm-hmm.

12:20.323 --> 12:21.490
Okay.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.259
I wouldn't even try.
It got burned.

12:24.260 --> 12:25.527
Sauce got burned.

12:25.528 --> 12:27.062
You're telling me
not to try it?

12:27.063 --> 12:28.497
I-I am, because the execution
is poor.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.098
[Softly]
Oh, don't say that, Guy.

12:30.099 --> 12:31.333
<i>I would not serve it.</i>

12:31.334 --> 12:32.267
Don't put it in your mouth.

12:32.268 --> 12:34.402
<i>It's not good.</i>

12:34.403 --> 12:35.537
It's not good!

12:35.538 --> 12:38.206
<i>It's not for eating.</i>

12:42.011 --> 12:43.445
<i>It tastes like</i>

12:43.446 --> 12:46.648
a [bleep] fish sundae.

12:46.649 --> 12:50.018
No points. Back in line.
[Bleep] me.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.587
<i>Oh, [bleep] almighty.
[Coughs]</i>

12:52.588 --> 12:53.989
Are you sure you're okay?

12:53.990 --> 12:56.591
[Coughing]

12:56.592 --> 12:59.094
Dude was like...
[wheezes heavily]

12:59.095 --> 13:00.295
[Coughing]

13:00.296 --> 13:01.463
Do you want to sit down?

13:01.464 --> 13:03.532
[Coughing]

13:03.533 --> 13:05.233
I looked at him
like, "are you all right?"

13:05.234 --> 13:07.636
This guy's a mess.
[Hacking]

13:07.637 --> 13:09.738
<i>(Gordon) You all right?
You want a chair?</i>

13:09.739 --> 13:11.706
<i>You look like
you're about to collapse.</i>

13:11.707 --> 13:14.743
I am getting seriously worried
about you.

13:14.744 --> 13:16.678
Is he gonna have
a heart attack right now?

13:16.679 --> 13:18.747
<i>[Coughing]
Do you want to see a medic?</i>

13:18.748 --> 13:20.916
[Hacking]

13:26.105 --> 13:27.906
(Announcer)
In the signature dish challenge,

13:27.907 --> 13:29.674
the men are losing
one to nothing,

13:29.675 --> 13:32.210
and now they may be
about to lose

13:32.211 --> 13:33.945
one member of their team.

13:33.946 --> 13:34.946
You okay?

13:34.947 --> 13:38.183
[Hacking]

13:38.184 --> 13:39.651
Do you want to see a medic?

13:39.652 --> 13:41.319
<i>No, I'm fine.
You sure?</i>

13:41.320 --> 13:42.954
Yeah, no, I'm... I'm good.

13:42.955 --> 13:44.422
I may be a little...
I may be a lot overweight.

13:44.423 --> 13:46.758
I still work
14, 16 hours a day.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.193
I will spin circles around you.

13:48.194 --> 13:50.095
Okay, next two.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.433
<i>First name is?
Roshni.</i>

13:55.434 --> 13:57.335
People definitely underestimate
me because of my size.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.070
But good things come
in small packages,

13:59.071 --> 14:00.071
so watch out.

14:00.072 --> 14:01.306
The dish is?

14:01.307 --> 14:03.642
It's coriander-crusted
rack of lamb.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.245
What you've got there
is the balance of flavors.

14:07.246 --> 14:08.346
<i>The seasoning is</i>

14:08.347 --> 14:09.714
absolutely 100% nailed.

14:09.715 --> 14:11.349
<i>Good job.</i>

14:11.350 --> 14:12.517
<i>First name is?</i>

14:12.518 --> 14:13.585
Royce.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.086
Chef Ramsay's gonna like me.

14:15.087 --> 14:16.388
Anything that I cook
is delicious.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.622
It's what I do.

14:17.623 --> 14:18.924
The dish, what is it?

14:18.925 --> 14:20.091
<i>It's pan-seared grouper.</i>

14:20.092 --> 14:21.293
Where do you cook?

14:21.294 --> 14:23.428
I cook at STK in South Beach.

14:23.429 --> 14:24.696
You're kidding me.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.164
So who's your executive chef?

14:26.165 --> 14:28.700
Uh, Ralph Pagano.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.203
<i>Season one runner-up.
Great chef.</i>

14:31.204 --> 14:32.571
<i>And he's your
executive chef now.</i>

14:32.572 --> 14:33.572
<i>Yes.
Wow.</i>

14:36.676 --> 14:37.909
<i>He's obviously passed on</i>

14:37.910 --> 14:38.877
some very good techniques.

14:38.878 --> 14:39.811
<i>That's delicious.</i>

14:39.812 --> 14:41.580
<i>Thank you.</i>

14:41.581 --> 14:43.849
You like me now?

14:43.850 --> 14:45.450
Two very good dishes.

14:45.451 --> 14:47.519
Um, both of you.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.321
<i>Congratulations.
Two good dishes.</i>

14:49.322 --> 14:51.556
Next two, let's go, please.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.825
(Announcer) With the women
still ahead two to one,

14:53.826 --> 14:54.926
saucier Danielle...

14:54.927 --> 14:56.995
It looks a mess.

14:56.996 --> 14:59.064
(Announcer)
Takes on sous chef Justin...

14:59.065 --> 15:01.199
Tastes nice.
You've nailed the seasoning.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.734
(Announcer) Who closes the
gap for the blue team.

15:02.735 --> 15:03.935
<i>Men.</i>

15:03.936 --> 15:05.670
<i>Well done.
(Clemenza) Yeah.</i>

15:05.671 --> 15:07.205
Okay, tied up.

15:07.206 --> 15:09.374
(Announcer) Private chef
Kimmie from Memphis...

15:09.375 --> 15:10.675
It's a fisherman's trio, chef.

15:12.178 --> 15:15.547
There's no way on earth
I'm taking that to Vegas.

15:15.548 --> 15:18.016
(Announcer) Battles Chicago
private chef Brian.

15:18.017 --> 15:19.117
<i>Dessert?</i>

15:19.118 --> 15:20.986
What the [bleep] are you doing?

15:20.987 --> 15:22.153
(Announcer) And it's a
public failure for both.

15:22.154 --> 15:23.989
No points.

15:23.990 --> 15:26.992
(Announcer) Next up, Pennsylvania
catering chef Barbie...

15:26.993 --> 15:28.960
Soggy potatoes.

15:28.961 --> 15:30.662
(Announcer)
Goes head-to-head

15:30.663 --> 15:32.564
against New York
executive chef Chris.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.299
They're bitter,

With another scoreless round,

15:38.537 --> 15:40.138
the teams remain tied.

15:40.139 --> 15:45.010
Now personal chef Briana
takes on executive chef Patrick.

15:45.011 --> 15:46.678
The duck tastes delicious.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.246
<i>You've nailed the seasoning.</i>

15:48.247 --> 15:49.915
Both of you get the point.
Good job.

cooking instructor Dana

15:58.257 --> 16:01.059
and Washington, D.C.
executive chef Tavon

16:01.060 --> 16:03.328
are both hoping their dishes
will stand out

16:03.329 --> 16:05.163
and give their team the lead.

16:05.164 --> 16:06.765
<i>First name is?
Dana.</i>

16:06.766 --> 16:07.999
Okay, what's the dish?

16:08.000 --> 16:11.136
<i>These are pan-seared scallops.</i>

16:11.137 --> 16:14.306
Chef Ramsay's big on scallops
and cooking them perfectly.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.609
But I'm not scared of him.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.978
<i>Scallops...</i>

16:19.979 --> 16:21.112
Cooked beautifully.

16:21.113 --> 16:23.114
<i>Thank you.
Yes.</i>

16:23.115 --> 16:24.516
It tastes delicious.

16:24.517 --> 16:25.750
Thank you, chef.

16:25.751 --> 16:27.886
Right, first name is?
Tavon.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.287
Your position now is what?

16:29.288 --> 16:30.622
I'm an executive chef in D.C.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.157
Wow. And how old are you?

16:32.158 --> 16:34.059
<i>I'm only 22.
You're 22.</i>

16:34.060 --> 16:35.994

16:35.995 --> 16:37.162

16:37.163 --> 16:38.396
Well done.
Amazing.

16:38.397 --> 16:40.465
<i>Thank you.
What is it?</i>

16:40.466 --> 16:41.466
[Bleep].

16:41.467 --> 16:42.667

16:54.680 --> 16:56.448
A light little drizzle.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.417
Drizzle?

16:59.418 --> 17:02.220
Well, more than a drizzle.

17:02.221 --> 17:04.823
I mean, it's hideous.

17:04.824 --> 17:08.359
<i>It is rank.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.128

17:11.130 --> 17:13.665
Congratulations, ladies.
Good job.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.834
That's a mess.
Yay.

17:15.835 --> 17:18.169
That's the first time
anybody said

17:18.170 --> 17:20.704
my food was so [bleep] up
on so many different levels.

17:20.705 --> 17:21.973
This is horrible.

17:21.973 --> 17:23.441
<i>(Gordon) Alfredo, my ass.</i>

17:23.442 --> 17:26.611
Okay, four to three
for the ladies.

17:26.612 --> 17:28.279
I'm nervous, but it's a fact

17:28.280 --> 17:29.948
that men are better cooks
than females.

17:29.949 --> 17:32.484
It's proven.
So I just can't wait to win.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.252
Last pairing, let's go.

17:34.253 --> 17:36.821
(Announcer) It's the final
round of signature dish,

17:36.822 --> 17:38.323
and the men are looking

17:38.324 --> 17:40.125
to New York corporate chef
Clemenza

17:40.126 --> 17:41.960
to keep them in the running
by defeating

17:41.961 --> 17:43.406
Philadelphia chef de cuisine
Christina.

17:43.407 --> 17:44.562
<i>Right, what's this?</i>

17:44.563 --> 17:46.698
It's a molasses-glazed
pork chop.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.166
I'm the chef de cuisine
at one of Philly's

17:48.167 --> 17:49.534
top 50 restaurants.

17:49.535 --> 17:50.902
The quality of food
that we put out

17:50.903 --> 17:52.237

17:52.238 --> 17:53.838

17:53.839 --> 17:55.840
<i>Pork's cooked perfect.</i>

17:55.841 --> 17:57.542

Amazing.

17:57.543 --> 17:58.843
<i>Great combination.</i>

17:58.844 --> 18:00.211
<i>(Christina) Thank you, chef.</i>

18:00.212 --> 18:01.446
Yes, thank you.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.281
<i>Right, first name is?

18:03.282 --> 18:05.050
<i>Clemenza, where are you from?
Staten Island, New York.</i>

18:05.051 --> 18:06.718
Chef Ramsay doesn't like
fat guys.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.219
But I think I'm gonna surprise
him a little bit,

18:08.220 --> 18:09.788
'cause I've been doing this
for 18 years,

18:09.789 --> 18:10.755
and I may even be
better than him.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.223
Okay, what is it?

18:12.224 --> 18:15.260
<i>Stuffed veal chop
with a truffle infusion.</i>

18:16.796 --> 18:19.097
Mm.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.699
Not the easiest thing
in the world to do.

18:21.700 --> 18:24.069
[Softly] Come on.

18:24.070 --> 18:27.305
You seasoned it beautifully.

18:27.306 --> 18:28.373
<i>Great sear.</i>

18:28.374 --> 18:30.809
Cooked stunning.

18:30.810 --> 18:35.113
But I've got
this aroma of truffle.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.781
Is it the bottle
of truffle oil?

18:36.782 --> 18:37.749
I finished with a little
truffle oil.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.918
A little?

18:39.919 --> 18:42.120
<i>Point goes to the women.</i>

18:42.121 --> 18:44.255
<i>And the challenge.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.164
Nice job.
Girls rule, boys drool.

18:53.165 --> 18:55.900
Men, as losers
of your first challenge,

18:55.901 --> 18:58.903
you'll not only be cleaning up
that pigsty behind you,

18:58.904 --> 19:01.973
<i>but you'll be cleaning up
the ladies' kitchen as well.</i>

19:01.974 --> 19:04.008
Can't [bleep] get
no worse than this

19:04.009 --> 19:05.510
than having Tavon
washing dishes.

19:05.511 --> 19:07.045
I have on white skinny jeans.

19:07.046 --> 19:09.981

They're stupid.
[Laughter]

20:17.149 --> 20:19.284

20:48.547 --> 20:50.248
All right,
I gotta go memorize this.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.716
Since the ladies
have a couple drinks

20:51.717 --> 20:52.750
inside of them,
they're definitely

20:52.751 --> 20:53.851
getting off-topic.

20:53.852 --> 20:55.820
All they do is
[mocking chatter].

20:55.821 --> 20:57.789
We're not in a sorority group,

20:57.790 --> 20:59.357
we should be focusing on
the recipe book and the menu.

20:59.358 --> 21:01.059
A perfectly cooked scallop
feels like the tip

21:01.060 --> 21:02.627

Table 30.

23:47.435 --> 23:48.635
One scallops,
one onion tart, one mussels,

23:48.636 --> 23:49.670
one lobster spaghetti.

23:49.671 --> 23:50.937
(All) Yes, chef!

23:50.938 --> 23:52.639
<i>Let's go, ladies.
Let's go.</i>

23:52.640 --> 23:53.874
Two and a half to
the window, scallops.

23:53.875 --> 23:55.475
As the first service,
it's almost like

23:55.476 --> 23:56.843
the first day of school,
you're always

23:56.844 --> 23:57.944
a little bit nervous.

23:57.945 --> 23:59.546
But then once you get
a feel of it, uh,

23:59.547 --> 24:00.614
<i>it works out.
(Andi) Come on, let's go.</i>

24:00.615 --> 24:02.115
You're up with scallops?

24:02.116 --> 24:05.285
Yeah.

24:05.286 --> 24:06.586
Unbelievable.

24:06.587 --> 24:07.988
<i>(Gordon) Roshni!</i>

24:07.989 --> 24:09.423
<i>Yes, chef?
What are these for?</i>

24:09.424 --> 24:10.757
We serve... look at me...

24:10.758 --> 24:12.125
we serve
five proportion, right?

24:12.126 --> 24:14.194
Sorry, chef.
I'll start again.

24:14.195 --> 24:15.762
Damn, dude!

24:15.763 --> 24:17.764
<i>This is not how we're
gonna [bleep] do tonight.</i>

24:17.765 --> 24:20.767
We gotta [bleep]
pull through this.

24:23.571 --> 24:25.539
I mean, [bleep] Me.
Un-[Bleep]-Real.

24:25.540 --> 24:26.606
Roshni!

24:26.607 --> 24:28.041
<i>Come here!
Yes, chef?</i>

24:28.042 --> 24:29.476
All of you!
Ladies, come here!

24:29.477 --> 24:30.744
<i>Yes, chef!</i>

24:30.745 --> 24:32.813
<i>Is that a sauteed scallop?
No, chef.</i>

24:32.814 --> 24:36.483
<i>(Gordon) Touch them.
Touch the scallops.</i>

24:36.484 --> 24:38.051
They felt squishy.

24:38.052 --> 24:40.387
Sorry, chef.
There's not any color on there!

24:40.388 --> 24:41.722
They're, like, raw!

24:41.723 --> 24:43.657
I guess Roshni
hasn't felt a [bleep]

24:43.658 --> 24:44.891
in quite some time.

24:44.892 --> 24:46.526
Those scallops were just raw.

24:46.527 --> 24:47.761
What are you doing?

24:47.762 --> 24:49.796
Sorry, chef.
I'll start again.

24:49.797 --> 24:51.765
(Announcer) While chef Ramsay
looks for perfect scallops

24:51.766 --> 24:52.899
in the red kitchen...

24:52.900 --> 24:54.701
Hey!
Scallops ready!

24:54.702 --> 24:56.636
(Announcer) Over in the blue
kitchen, the men are ready

24:56.637 --> 24:58.705
with their first appetizers.

24:58.706 --> 25:00.407
So we got the two
onion tarts up.

25:00.408 --> 25:02.409
<i>Risotto's going up.
Caesar salad now.</i>

25:02.410 --> 25:04.311
<i>(Announcer) Well, make
that most of the men.</i>

25:04.312 --> 25:06.580
Anybody know
where anchovies are?

25:06.581 --> 25:07.881
I need anchovies,
or we're not getting

25:07.882 --> 25:09.516
a salad out.

25:09.517 --> 25:10.650
Royce is like,

25:10.651 --> 25:12.152
"I need
the [bleep] anchovies!"

25:12.153 --> 25:13.587
Anchovies!

25:13.588 --> 25:15.122
Are you serious?

25:15.123 --> 25:17.958
You get your bitch ass
and get the [bleep] anchovies!

25:17.959 --> 25:20.160
What the [bleep]?

25:20.161 --> 25:21.695
I can't make nothing!

25:21.696 --> 25:23.830
Guy prepped the salad station.

25:23.831 --> 25:25.265
I guess he didn't
think that Caesar salad

25:25.266 --> 25:25.866
needed anchovies.

25:25.867 --> 25:27.567
I was ambushed 100%.

25:27.568 --> 25:29.202
What you talking about, Royce?

25:29.203 --> 25:31.104
What you need, buddy?
Anchovies, man.

25:31.105 --> 25:33.640
(Announcer) While Royce continues
to search for anchovies,

25:33.641 --> 25:35.275
the red team is still looking

25:35.276 --> 25:37.544
for Roshni's
first order of scallops.

25:37.545 --> 25:38.612
<i>Scallops!</i>

25:38.613 --> 25:39.846
Yeah.
Another minute.

25:39.847 --> 25:41.982
We're still on appetizers.

25:41.983 --> 25:43.950
I don't understand why
you can't cook the scallops.

25:43.951 --> 25:45.685
It's really not
that [bleep] hard at all.

25:45.686 --> 25:48.688
Ready, chef!

25:55.163 --> 25:56.630
Hey, all of you.
Come here.

25:56.631 --> 25:58.765
<i>Oh, man.</i>

25:58.766 --> 26:02.736
This is some [bleep].
Wow!

26:02.737 --> 26:04.871
I've had enough.
Just touch these.

26:04.872 --> 26:07.207
<i>(Gordon) I mean, honestly.
I'm sorry, chef.</i>

26:07.208 --> 26:09.242
Now we're standing here,
45 minutes into the service.

26:09.243 --> 26:11.978
<i>We haven't even got
a [bleep] appetizer out yet!</i>

26:11.979 --> 26:13.180
Get out!

26:13.181 --> 26:15.015
<i>Get out of here!
No, chef. No.</i>

26:15.016 --> 26:16.416
<i>Hey, look at me.
Look at me. Please.</i>

26:16.417 --> 26:18.718
I'm not telling you
one more time.

26:18.719 --> 26:20.487
Get the [bleep] out of here!

26:20.488 --> 26:21.788
<i>[Bleep] off upstairs!</i>

26:21.789 --> 26:24.224
Get out!

26:24.225 --> 26:25.292
<i>Barbie!</i>

26:25.293 --> 26:26.760
Get on the scallops.

26:26.761 --> 26:28.495
Cook me some [bleep] scallops.
Yes, chef.

26:28.496 --> 26:30.297
I've never, ever
walked off the line.

26:30.298 --> 26:32.065
I've always completed
dinner service.

26:32.066 --> 26:33.533
[Sobs]

26:33.534 --> 26:35.202
Walking with scallops!

26:35.203 --> 26:37.270
Salad for scallops, walking!

26:37.271 --> 26:39.105
(Announcer) With Roshni
off the fish station...

26:39.106 --> 26:40.340
Service, please.

26:40.341 --> 26:42.042
Two separate tables.
Let's go.

26:42.043 --> 26:43.543
(Announcer) The red
team, thanks to Barbie,

26:43.544 --> 26:45.412
finally sends
its first appetizers

26:45.413 --> 26:46.580
out to the dining room.

26:46.581 --> 26:48.114
This is very good.

26:48.115 --> 26:49.850
(Announcer) Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen...

26:49.851 --> 26:51.718
Anchovies?
I love you.

26:51.719 --> 26:53.587
Caesar salad, one minute!

26:53.588 --> 26:55.155
(Announcer) Royce has finally
found his anchovies.

26:55.156 --> 26:57.023
<i>(Gordon) Tavon, how long?</i>

26:57.024 --> 26:58.625
(Announcer) And now the
men are ready to send out

26:58.626 --> 26:59.793
their first table
of appetizers.

26:59.794 --> 27:03.129
Coming to the plate.

27:03.130 --> 27:05.532
It's [bleep] raw.

27:05.533 --> 27:07.601
The pigeon's still raw.

27:07.602 --> 27:09.703
Hey. Hey, hey,
all of you! Stop!

27:09.704 --> 27:10.804
<i>Look.</i>

27:10.805 --> 27:12.305
This [bleep] pigeon is that raw

27:12.306 --> 27:13.807
it can still fly.
Touch it.

27:13.808 --> 27:16.042
Stone-[Bleep]-cold
and raw!

27:16.043 --> 27:18.011
Come on!

27:18.012 --> 27:19.513
Tavon couldn't cook a squab.

27:19.514 --> 27:21.381
Like, he's just
a [bleep] moron.

27:21.382 --> 27:23.350
Are you serious that
you're an executive chef?

27:23.351 --> 27:24.684
Yes, chef.
I actually am, yes. Yeah?

27:24.685 --> 27:26.086
How long for this table?

27:26.087 --> 27:28.588
Four minutes
on the squab, chef.

27:28.589 --> 27:29.623
[Bleep] me.

27:29.624 --> 27:31.157
Yes, uh, where's my food?

27:31.158 --> 27:32.526
Yeah.
I do apologize.

27:33.828 --> 27:35.662
How long have we been here?

27:35.663 --> 27:37.631
(Announcer) It's an hour
into dinner service,

27:37.632 --> 27:40.233
and the blue team has yet
to serve a single appetizer.

27:40.234 --> 27:42.068
Apologies for the delays.

27:42.069 --> 27:44.371
(Announcer) And while they
wait on Tavon's squab,

27:44.372 --> 27:47.407
Justin on scallops
and Patrick on garnish

27:47.408 --> 27:49.509
are moving forward
on the next table.

27:49.510 --> 27:50.744
Next table, how long?

27:50.745 --> 27:52.546
Right now, chef.
Ten seconds.

27:52.547 --> 27:54.481
Tavon is going down in flames.

27:54.482 --> 27:56.583
I'm not gonna sit back
and just watch this happen.

27:56.584 --> 27:59.185
If we just get
that first order out,

27:59.186 --> 28:01.488
it can all turn around for us.

28:01.489 --> 28:02.822
Okay, stop!

28:02.823 --> 28:04.691
You! Don't touch
another [bleep] scallop.

28:04.692 --> 28:06.826
Come here!
Just touch these!

28:06.827 --> 28:08.929
Touch them!

28:08.930 --> 28:10.630
[Bleep]!

28:10.631 --> 28:12.198
Why are they all broken?

28:12.199 --> 28:14.100
<i>What the [bleep] have you done?</i>

28:14.101 --> 28:15.835
I'm working with scallops
that are complete [bleep].

28:15.836 --> 28:16.970
I was completely sabotaged.

28:16.971 --> 28:18.772
Who sliced all these?

28:18.773 --> 28:20.907
<i>(Justin) Someone
else did my... chef.</i>

28:20.908 --> 28:22.208
<i>Who sliced the scallops?
Chef's asking a question.</i>

28:22.209 --> 28:23.443
<i>(Tavon) I did.</i>

28:23.444 --> 28:24.444
<i>(Gordon) Come here, you.</i>

28:24.445 --> 28:25.779
<i>Executive chef.</i>

28:25.780 --> 28:27.581
Come here.

28:27.582 --> 28:31.318
Look at these.

28:31.319 --> 28:34.754
Expensive,
hand-dived scallops.

28:34.755 --> 28:36.756
Look.
You've sabotaged them.

28:36.757 --> 28:37.991
This is ugly.

28:37.992 --> 28:39.926
The scallops
were just mutilated.

28:39.927 --> 28:42.629
Hold on, it gets better.
Look at this one.

28:42.630 --> 28:44.664
It look like they got cut
with a paper clip.

28:44.665 --> 28:47.133
I mean, [bleep] how?

28:47.134 --> 28:48.401
Look!

28:48.402 --> 28:49.703
<i>That's it.
That's everything.</i>

28:49.704 --> 28:50.570
We're in trouble.

28:50.571 --> 28:52.472
You sliced all them!

28:52.473 --> 28:55.408
<i>We haven't even served
one [bleep] table!</i>

28:55.409 --> 28:56.977
They're all [bleep].

28:56.978 --> 28:59.179
<i>Look!
Look!</i>

28:59.180 --> 29:02.182
Like a bunch of idiots here!

29:07.366 --> 29:09.467
(Announcer) It's 75 minutes
into dinner service,

29:09.468 --> 29:11.702
and the blue kitchen
has yet to send out

29:11.703 --> 29:14.171
a single appetizer.
I'm hungry.

29:14.172 --> 29:17.041
(Announcer) And thanks to Tavon's
poorly prepped scallops...

29:17.042 --> 29:19.410
You sliced all them!

29:19.411 --> 29:21.379
They're all [bleep]!
Look!

29:21.380 --> 29:23.381
(Announcer) It doesn't look
as if that will be changing

29:23.382 --> 29:24.849
anytime soon.

29:24.850 --> 29:27.084
We're serving onion tart
in place of scallops.

29:27.085 --> 29:28.786
<i>Oui, chef.
Thank you.</i>

29:28.787 --> 29:34.425
Tavon treated those scallops
like a homeless rat.

29:34.426 --> 29:36.260
You should never
do that to scallops.

29:36.261 --> 29:37.995
How are you, executive chef?

29:37.996 --> 29:40.164
Do you actually cook
in your restaurants?

29:40.165 --> 29:42.099
Yes, I do.
And do they do the same there?

29:42.100 --> 29:44.335
Do we do what?
The same [bleep]?

29:44.336 --> 29:45.369
No. No.

29:45.370 --> 29:46.971
So why are you doing it here?

29:46.972 --> 29:48.239
I guess I froze.
I mean...

29:48.240 --> 29:49.507
You froze?

29:49.508 --> 29:51.142
What else... what else
do you want me to say?

29:51.143 --> 29:53.811
You haven't even
[bleep] defrosted.

29:53.812 --> 29:55.746
[Laughs]

29:55.747 --> 29:57.048
You think it's funny?

29:57.049 --> 29:59.183
All those [bleep] customers?

29:59.184 --> 30:00.284
Do me a favor.
Yeah.

30:00.285 --> 30:01.552
[Bleep] off upstairs.

30:01.553 --> 30:04.088
Get out!

30:04.089 --> 30:05.489
Ahh!

30:05.490 --> 30:07.324
This was the first time
I've ever been kicked out

30:07.325 --> 30:08.993
of the kitchen in my career.

30:08.994 --> 30:12.897
Chef Ramsay,
you're a [bleep] douchebag.

30:14.132 --> 30:15.933
One onion tart, one spaghetti!
How long?

30:15.934 --> 30:17.334
What are we waiting on?
What do we got?

30:17.335 --> 30:19.003
What are we waiting on?

30:19.004 --> 30:20.971
I'm waiting on
some [bleep] talent!

30:20.972 --> 30:21.972
Yes, chef.

30:21.973 --> 30:25.142
This is a [bleep] joke!

30:25.143 --> 30:27.645
(Announcer) Thoroughly frustrated
with the blue kitchen,

30:27.646 --> 30:30.614
chef Ramsay turns his attention
to the red kitchen...

30:30.615 --> 30:32.750
Spaghetti walking to the pass.

30:32.751 --> 30:35.019
(Announcer) Where the women have
steadily pushed out appetizers.

30:35.020 --> 30:37.121
Service.

30:37.122 --> 30:38.723
Really good.

30:38.724 --> 30:40.491
That is amazing.

30:40.492 --> 30:42.960
(Announcer) Now it's up to
Christina on the meat station...

30:42.961 --> 30:44.895
We're ready!
To the window!

30:44.896 --> 30:46.931
(Announcer) To keep the
momentum going with entrees.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.699
Wellington chicken
to the window!

30:48.700 --> 30:51.102
Let's go.

30:51.103 --> 30:53.337
Ladies, we got this!
We got this!

30:53.338 --> 30:54.672
For real!

30:54.673 --> 30:57.007
Oh, my God.
I mean, seriously?

30:57.008 --> 31:00.177
What in the [bleep] is that?

31:00.178 --> 31:01.312
I guess not.

31:01.313 --> 31:02.847
<i>Who cooked that?
Come here.</i>

31:02.848 --> 31:04.081
<i>The dough is still raw.</i>

31:04.082 --> 31:05.516
Are you [bleep] for real?

31:05.517 --> 31:06.984
You want me
to serve that out there?

31:06.985 --> 31:08.085
No, chef.

31:08.086 --> 31:09.954
<i>It's just a joke.</i>

31:09.955 --> 31:11.722
Damn it, we gotta push out
the entrees!

31:11.723 --> 31:13.724
Christina's killing us
right now.

31:13.725 --> 31:15.292
Have you got
another Wellington?

31:15.293 --> 31:16.761
<i>(Christina) Yes.</i>

31:16.762 --> 31:18.195
That's the thing
with baking Wellington.

31:18.196 --> 31:19.396
You don't know until the end,

31:19.397 --> 31:21.232
and there's nothing
you can do, so I'm praying,

31:21.233 --> 31:24.702
like, "oh, one of these beef,
they have to be okay."

31:24.703 --> 31:26.237
Look, it's raw.

31:26.238 --> 31:28.339
[Bleep] Raw.

31:28.340 --> 31:30.007
So now,
in the middle of service,

31:30.008 --> 31:31.375
we took the ones
that were rolled,

31:31.376 --> 31:33.677
broke them down,
rolled out new pastry dough,

31:33.678 --> 31:36.080
rewrapped them, and got
them in the oven right away.

31:36.081 --> 31:37.648
You know, basically
we're just sitting there

31:37.649 --> 31:38.682
waiting for it to cook.

31:38.683 --> 31:39.917
Chicken Wellington, how long?

31:39.918 --> 31:41.719
15 on the Wellingtons.

31:41.720 --> 31:42.820
15 what?

31:42.821 --> 31:44.522
Minutes, on the Wellingtons.

31:44.523 --> 31:47.858
For 15 minutes, service
definitely was silent.

31:47.859 --> 31:52.496
[Crickets]

31:52.497 --> 31:53.964
I mean, this is a joke.

31:53.965 --> 31:55.800
<i>An absolute joke.</i>

31:55.801 --> 31:57.701
(Announcer) While the red team
waits for the Wellingtons,

31:57.702 --> 31:59.270
over in the blue kitchen...

31:59.271 --> 32:01.172
Spaghetti, onion tart,
pigeon... how long?

32:01.173 --> 32:03.741
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay is
unbelievably still waiting

32:03.742 --> 32:05.442
for the first appetizers.

32:05.443 --> 32:06.877
Royce!
Yes, chef?

32:06.878 --> 32:08.479
<i>Tavon's gone.</i>

32:08.480 --> 32:11.148
<i>Are you gonna lead the [bleep] section?
Yes, chef!</i>

32:11.149 --> 32:13.250
Royce, come on!
Get in the game!

32:13.251 --> 32:14.752
I'm here, chef.

32:14.753 --> 32:17.087
Royce can make spaghetti.
Royce can make squab.

32:17.088 --> 32:19.657
Royce can make everything.
I got this.

32:19.658 --> 32:20.991
Break a sweat, Royce!

32:20.992 --> 32:22.326
Yes, chef.

32:22.327 --> 32:23.994
Got about a minute
and a half on the pasta.

32:23.995 --> 32:25.396
<i>My spaghetti's coming up.</i>

32:25.397 --> 32:26.630
I'm [bleep] ready.
We're ready.

32:26.631 --> 32:29.433
[Bleep] Let's go.

32:31.503 --> 32:32.703
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We got it.

32:32.704 --> 32:33.838
It's good to go.

32:33.839 --> 32:35.773
I work for a pasta company
that produces

32:35.774 --> 32:38.342
a million pounds
of pasta a day.

32:38.343 --> 32:40.477
Royce, let me clue you in
on a little something.

32:40.478 --> 32:41.712
That spaghetti ain't done.

32:41.713 --> 32:44.715
Don't put that.

32:47.652 --> 32:49.987
Hey, come here.

32:49.988 --> 32:51.789
Crunchy [bleep] spaghetti.

32:51.790 --> 32:53.324
Crunchy...
you can just see it.

32:53.325 --> 32:54.758
Pick that up, look.
Crunchy.

32:54.759 --> 32:55.893
Sorry, chef.
I'll have one in 30 seconds.

32:55.894 --> 32:57.194
Hey, hey.
Get out!

32:57.195 --> 32:58.662
I have one in 30 seconds, chef.

32:58.663 --> 32:59.597
<i>Hey, look at me.
Get out!</i>

32:59.598 --> 33:01.866
Join the [bleep] exec upstairs!

33:01.867 --> 33:04.869
Get the [bleep] out of here!

33:07.539 --> 33:09.139
[Bleep] that [bleep].

33:09.140 --> 33:11.508
I'm the best chef
in Hell's Kitchen.

33:11.509 --> 33:13.577
I don't deserve
to get kicked out.

33:13.578 --> 33:14.578
[Bleep].

33:14.579 --> 33:15.946
<i>Spaghetti.</i>

33:15.947 --> 33:18.816
[Bleep] bush league.

33:18.817 --> 33:21.652
(Announcer) Nearly two
hours into dinner service,

33:21.653 --> 33:23.854
the women are stalled
on the entrees.

33:23.855 --> 33:25.656
Chicken Wellington, how long?

33:25.657 --> 33:28.092
Five more minutes now, chef.
Five minutes.

33:28.093 --> 33:30.728
(Announcer) And the men are still
a mess with the appetizers.

33:30.729 --> 33:32.730
I hope you're
[bleep] proud of this.

33:32.731 --> 33:34.632
Like a bunch of idiots here!

33:34.633 --> 33:37.101
Come on, guys.
We need to rally back here.

33:37.102 --> 33:40.070
Don's, uh,
living in his own world.

33:40.071 --> 33:43.007
He was wandering around,
not knowing what the [bleep]

33:43.008 --> 33:44.742
to do with himself.

33:44.743 --> 33:46.410
Two Caesar salads,
one onion tart.

33:46.411 --> 33:47.611
How long?

33:47.612 --> 33:49.179
Onion tart walking.
Got an onion tart.

33:49.180 --> 33:50.915
<i>Three right now.
Three right now.</i>

33:50.916 --> 33:52.516
<i>Check to see
if they're done, men.</i>

33:52.517 --> 33:53.617
Put that down.
Just put the whole

33:53.618 --> 33:57.121
[bleep] tray down.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.223
[Bleep] raw!

33:59.224 --> 34:01.191
All of you.
All of you!

34:01.192 --> 34:02.192
<i>[Bleep]</i>

34:02.193 --> 34:03.193
Raw!

34:03.194 --> 34:04.295
[Bleep].

34:04.296 --> 34:05.763
You can't cook pastry.

34:05.764 --> 34:08.232
End of the day for me!
Get out!

34:08.233 --> 34:11.235
All of you, get out!

34:17.880 --> 34:19.947
(Announcer) Two hours
into the grand reopening

34:19.949 --> 34:21.748
of Hell's Kitchen,
the blue team has had

34:21.750 --> 34:24.052
a complete meltdown.

34:24.053 --> 34:25.253
<i>(Gordon) All of you!</i>

34:25.254 --> 34:26.286
<i>Stop!</i>

34:26.288 --> 34:29.324
End of the day for me!
Get out!

34:29.324 --> 34:31.458
Never in my life
have I been so embarrassed.

34:31.460 --> 34:33.161
Anybody who was on that line
that wasn't embarrassed

34:33.161 --> 34:35.129
doesn't belong anywhere
in a kitchen.

34:35.130 --> 34:36.731
That blows.

34:36.732 --> 34:38.866
(Announcer) With the men
kicked out of the kitchen,

34:38.867 --> 34:41.101
chef Ramsay's focus
is entirely on the women...

34:41.103 --> 34:43.603
Walking to the window
with the Wellington!

34:43.605 --> 34:47.308
(Announcer) Who are still attempting
to send out their first entrees.

34:47.309 --> 34:50.610
It's still the same
[Bleep] table.

34:50.612 --> 34:51.713
<i>All of you, come here.</i>

34:51.714 --> 34:54.047
[Bleep] me.

34:54.049 --> 34:58.019
Look!
It's like [bleep] snot!

34:58.020 --> 35:00.288
There's just no thought!

35:00.289 --> 35:01.289
Shut it down

35:01.290 --> 35:03.157
and [bleep] clean up.

35:03.158 --> 35:04.359
(All) Yes, chef.

35:04.360 --> 35:06.361
[Bleep].

35:08.297 --> 35:09.998
I didn't expect
my first dinner service

35:09.999 --> 35:13.101
to be like this
in the slightest.

35:13.102 --> 35:16.304
I'm just sorry that, uh,
I couldn't come through.

35:23.379 --> 35:25.013
Uh, where do I start?
[Exhales]

35:25.014 --> 35:28.850
Clearly, I got
a service to remember.

35:28.851 --> 35:31.319
100 diners...

35:31.320 --> 35:33.621
18 chefs...

35:33.622 --> 35:36.724
Zero entrees served.

35:36.725 --> 35:37.725
<i>Ridiculous.</i>

35:37.726 --> 35:41.129
Zero.

35:41.130 --> 35:44.132
The losing team tonight?

35:47.636 --> 35:49.971
The blue team.
Yeah.

35:49.972 --> 35:52.907
You sucked.

35:52.908 --> 35:57.345
At least the red kitchen
completed the appetizers.

35:57.346 --> 35:59.881
I want the blue team...

35:59.882 --> 36:03.184
come to a consensus
which two chefs

36:03.185 --> 36:04.585
should be up for elimination.

36:04.586 --> 36:06.154
Now [bleep] off.

36:06.155 --> 36:09.157
<i>All of you.</i>

36:12.828 --> 36:14.595
Damn right we deserve to win,

36:14.596 --> 36:15.863
because we got our apps out
and they didn't.

36:15.864 --> 36:17.365
Once he said, "if I had to pick

36:17.366 --> 36:18.533
a worse team,"
I knew it wasn't us.

36:18.534 --> 36:19.834
I have a heart.

36:19.835 --> 36:21.502
I don't want
to see anyone go home,

36:21.503 --> 36:22.904
but I'd rather it
be them than us.

36:22.905 --> 36:25.673
One of them is going home,
and one of us is not.

36:25.674 --> 36:27.608
Who was the two
weakest [bleep] links?

36:27.609 --> 36:29.310
Who's gonna go first?

36:29.311 --> 36:31.245
The two guys who were
working the appetizer station

36:31.246 --> 36:33.414
are the two guys that got
booted out of the kitchen,

36:33.415 --> 36:37.051
and it's the station that
completely [bleep] everybody.

36:37.052 --> 36:38.953
My two nominations
are gonna be, uh,

36:38.954 --> 36:41.589
<i>Tavon and Royce,
based solely on that.</i>

36:41.590 --> 36:43.491
You gotta understand,
I walked into.

36:43.492 --> 36:46.494
"I need one Caesar"
and not enough prep for it.

36:46.495 --> 36:48.596
Who prepped the salad station?

36:48.597 --> 36:49.797
<i>Guy.</i>

36:49.798 --> 36:51.432
So I forgot
your [bleep] anchovies.

36:51.433 --> 36:53.301
What the [bleep]?
Big deal.

36:53.302 --> 36:55.403
Go to the [bleep] fridge
in the back and get them.

36:55.404 --> 36:58.039
He's just like
a little girl, this kid.

36:58.040 --> 36:59.640
Based upon
tonight's performance,

36:59.641 --> 37:02.477
I mean, I would
have to say Royce.

37:02.478 --> 37:04.745
<i>But if you take
the overall picture,</i>

37:04.746 --> 37:07.181
I would almost have to say Don.

37:07.182 --> 37:09.450
<i>Who's the better asset
to have on the team</i>

37:09.451 --> 37:12.753
between them two, it would
be Royce rather than Don.

37:12.754 --> 37:14.589
Don didn't do anything
tonight in the kitchen.

37:14.590 --> 37:15.289
I had him picked
from the beginning

37:15.290 --> 37:16.557
as one of the weakest links.

37:16.558 --> 37:17.859
If you don't have
what it takes,

37:17.860 --> 37:18.793
then you should not be here.

37:18.794 --> 37:20.962
I'm with Tavon and Don too.

37:20.963 --> 37:22.897
My whole thing is
I did not get a chance

37:22.898 --> 37:25.266
to prove what I can do.

37:25.267 --> 37:28.202
I mean, I didn't get to
put out one [bleep] entree.

37:28.203 --> 37:29.904
This doesn't make any sense.

37:29.905 --> 37:32.039
I never had a chance
to do anything today.

37:32.040 --> 37:34.775
So based on performance alone,
the person who was

37:34.776 --> 37:36.744
supposed to be my assistant,
that wanted to

37:36.745 --> 37:38.446
take charge of the area,
[bleep] up just as bad

37:38.447 --> 37:40.414
as I am, and you all
putting Don up.

37:40.415 --> 37:42.517
<i>I-I-I don't think that Don
should still go up.</i>

37:42.518 --> 37:44.785
Did you guys
witness the same events

37:44.786 --> 37:46.354
that I just witnessed?

37:46.355 --> 37:49.157
Royce is a [bleep]-up,
and is all over the place.

37:49.158 --> 37:52.160
Ah, [bleep], man.

38:03.705 --> 38:04.839
(Gordon) Men,

38:04.840 --> 38:06.274
have you reached a decision?

38:06.275 --> 38:07.642
(All) Yes, chef.

38:07.643 --> 38:09.443
Patrick?
Yes, chef?

38:09.444 --> 38:10.845
First nominee and why.

38:10.846 --> 38:12.713
Our first nominee is Tavon.

38:12.714 --> 38:14.715
He was in charge
of the hot appetizers,

38:14.716 --> 38:16.717
and the squab really
set us off the wrong way,

38:16.718 --> 38:18.386
and he couldn't
recover from those.

38:18.387 --> 38:20.621
Yeah, he got
screwed by a pigeon.

38:20.622 --> 38:22.023
<i>Second nominee and why?</i>

38:22.024 --> 38:27.795
The second nominee, uh, is...

38:31.086 --> 38:33.287
(Announcer) After a
terrible dinner service

38:33.288 --> 38:35.055
where no entrees were served,

38:35.056 --> 38:36.457
the blue team nominated...

38:36.458 --> 38:38.292
Tavon.

38:38.293 --> 38:40.327
(Announcer) And now must
give their second nominee.

38:40.328 --> 38:43.197
The second nominee,

38:43.198 --> 38:45.399
uh, is Don.

38:45.400 --> 38:46.800
<i>(Gordon)
Don? Why?</i>

38:46.801 --> 38:48.636
He didn't even cook.

38:48.637 --> 38:51.572
Not only did you put in
a [bleep] performance,

38:51.573 --> 38:54.975
but you came to
a crap consensus.

38:54.976 --> 38:57.478
The two worst tonight...

38:57.479 --> 39:00.314
<i>Tavon...</i>

39:00.315 --> 39:02.950
<i>And Royce.</i>

39:02.951 --> 39:04.885
And now you two
can step forward.

39:04.886 --> 39:07.888
<i>Let's go.</i>

39:11.192 --> 39:12.626
Tavon, tell me,

39:12.627 --> 39:14.595
from an executive chef's
point of view,

39:14.596 --> 39:17.197
why you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen.

39:17.198 --> 39:18.632
Hurry up.

39:18.633 --> 39:20.801
Um, I definitely knew
that I was more of the reason

39:20.802 --> 39:23.470
that everything went down,
and I took responsibility

39:23.471 --> 39:25.272
for everything that happened.

39:25.273 --> 39:26.907
What would you rate your
performance this evening?

39:26.908 --> 39:28.509
Line chef, sous chef?

39:28.510 --> 39:30.911
Probably a prep cook
that got thrown onto the line.

39:30.912 --> 39:32.613
Well, that's way off
my estimate.

39:32.614 --> 39:34.114
I would have said dishwasher

39:34.115 --> 39:37.251
on a [bleep] day.

39:37.252 --> 39:38.419
<i>Royce.</i>

39:38.420 --> 39:39.720
Tell me why you think
you should stay

39:39.721 --> 39:40.821
in Hell's Kitchen.

39:40.822 --> 39:42.656
I showed you what I had
in my signature dish.

39:42.657 --> 39:44.124
<i>I didn't perform well tonight.</i>

39:44.125 --> 39:45.492
I tried, I pushed...
I tried.

39:45.493 --> 39:47.194
I really tried.

39:47.195 --> 39:50.631
And I just,
I r... [stammering]

39:50.632 --> 39:53.367
I felt I was already sabotaged.

39:53.368 --> 39:54.668
<i>(Gordon) Sabotaged?</i>

39:54.669 --> 39:56.370
Who sabotaged your section?

39:56.371 --> 39:59.440
I feel that... the people
who we... set up and...

39:59.441 --> 40:02.609
<i>Who?
I feel like Guy set up the station.</i>

40:02.610 --> 40:04.378
Guy, did you sabotage Royce?

40:04.379 --> 40:06.814
'Cause he's under
the impression you did.

40:06.815 --> 40:09.783
I don't know why
he thinks I sabotaged him.

40:09.784 --> 40:11.652
I did forget the anchovies,

40:11.653 --> 40:14.855
but I don't see
a sabotage in that.

40:14.856 --> 40:18.325
I'm done with B.S.
for the night.

40:18.326 --> 40:19.727
I wanted to do
something special

40:19.728 --> 40:21.695
to launch our tenth year.

40:21.696 --> 40:24.298
You turned it into a disaster,

40:24.299 --> 40:28.202
both of you, seriously,
really disappointed.

40:28.203 --> 40:33.307
My decision is...

40:33.308 --> 40:34.839
Royce.

40:37.612 --> 40:40.881
<i>Back in line.</i>

40:40.882 --> 40:44.685
Tavon.

40:44.686 --> 40:48.322
Give me your jacket.
Leave Hell's Kitchen.

40:48.323 --> 40:51.325
Good night.

40:55.797 --> 40:58.065
Being the first to be
eliminated sucks, of course.

40:58.066 --> 40:59.967
Nobody wants to go home first.

40:59.968 --> 41:02.369
But I did what I did.
I messed up.

41:02.370 --> 41:04.538
But now I'm looking forward
to sitting on my couch

41:04.539 --> 41:07.541
and see Royce's ass go
the [bleep] home next week.

41:07.542 --> 41:08.642
Men, tonight,

41:08.643 --> 41:11.578
the fight back was appalling.

41:11.579 --> 41:13.747
The confusion was evident.

41:13.748 --> 41:16.750
Get a grip.
Got it?

41:16.751 --> 41:18.085
(All) Yes, chef.

41:18.086 --> 41:20.454
Now [bleep] off.

41:20.455 --> 41:22.689
Whoo-hoo!

41:22.690 --> 41:24.091
[Laughs]

41:24.092 --> 41:27.394
<i>Chef Ramsay called
damn near every person out</i>

41:27.395 --> 41:28.595
<i>for putting me up there.</i>

41:28.596 --> 41:30.831
Unh!

41:30.832 --> 41:34.201
Royce, he goes up there
and throws me under the bus

41:34.202 --> 41:36.804
and then puts a truck
behind it and a train

41:36.805 --> 41:38.138
to go over me too.

41:38.139 --> 41:39.673
Well, that doesn't work
in my world.

41:39.674 --> 41:41.675
You fall down again,
I'll put you up there.

41:41.676 --> 41:44.178
It's just a matter of time.

41:44.179 --> 41:45.979
The guys are acting
like little bitches.

41:45.980 --> 41:47.214
They're turning
against each other.

41:47.215 --> 41:48.348
They're not working as a team.

41:48.349 --> 41:49.783
We're gonna kick the boys' ass

41:49.784 --> 41:51.585
tomorrow, the next day,
the day after that.

41:51.586 --> 41:55.489
Unbelievable.

41:55.490 --> 41:58.158
Tavon may be
an executive chef at 22,

41:58.159 --> 41:59.860
but he did little to impress me

41:59.861 --> 42:03.664
in his short stay
in Hell's Kitchen.

42:05.600 --> 42:08.202
<i>(Announcer) Next time
on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:08.203 --> 42:10.237
Open your [bleep] eyes, bozo!

42:10.238 --> 42:12.673
(Announcer) The blue team
is looking for redemption.

42:12.674 --> 42:14.174
There's something seriously
[bleep] up with this team.

42:14.175 --> 42:15.476
No!

42:15.477 --> 42:17.277
(Announcer) But there
may be no saving them.

42:17.278 --> 42:17.945
I don't know
how to wake you up.

42:17.946 --> 42:19.313
You're like a zombie!

42:19.314 --> 42:20.447
(Announcer)
Can the men come together...

42:20.448 --> 42:21.782
You're not manning up!

42:21.783 --> 42:23.083
(Announcer)
Before they come to blows?

42:23.084 --> 42:24.184
Guy just hit me in the face.

42:24.185 --> 42:25.486
Royce is like a little girl.

42:25.487 --> 42:28.155
I don't know how things
got so [bleep] crazy.

42:28.156 --> 42:30.891
(Announcer) And on the red team,
one chef makes an enemy...

42:30.892 --> 42:32.960
Get your ass up
and talk to me, Barbie!

42:32.961 --> 42:34.628
I-I-I...
no, you did not!

42:34.629 --> 42:36.396
(Announcer) Out of everybody.

42:36.397 --> 42:37.397
You done brought some Memphis
outta me, ho.

42:37.398 --> 42:38.799
You [bleep] up.

42:38.800 --> 42:40.501
(Announcer)
And when the women throw down...

42:40.502 --> 42:41.802
Might have a brawl
tonight in the dorms.

42:41.803 --> 42:43.403
[Shouting] (Announcer)
It's fight night.

42:43.404 --> 42:45.606
Nobody wants
your bitch ass here.

42:45.607 --> 42:48.060
(Announcer) All next time
on a bloody good episode...

42:48.061 --> 42:49.236
Royce deserved it.

42:49.237 --> 42:51.272
Idiot!
(Announcer) Of Hell's Kitchen.

42:52.965 --> 42:54.417
What is wrong with you?
