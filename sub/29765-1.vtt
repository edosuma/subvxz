10:47.356 --> 10:48.690
That's what they do,
they did holes.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.776
I need a hole dug,
they can dig it.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.319
Put a body in the hole.

10:52.653 --> 10:53.654
Maybe!

10:54.655 --> 10:55.739
Want a hole, yes.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.074
That they can do.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.158

10:58.242 --> 10:59.618
caper, he's like a caper.

11:00.077 --> 11:01.828
A real life fucking caper.

11:03.205 --> 11:04.206
Well!

11:05.374 --> 11:06.458
The guys got ambition,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.001
I can applaud that.

11:08.710 --> 11:09.711
But Tom,

11:10.170 --> 11:11.213

11:26.228 --> 11:27.813
Ever seen any of
those fights on ESPN?

11:29.189 --> 11:30.274
You gotta be fucking nuts.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.030
Should have
been easy money, Tom.

11:39.241 --> 11:41.368
And isn't the first fucking
time with this Rudy either.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.037
[Myster sighs]

11:44.913 --> 11:45.914
And now I've got this,

11:45.998 --> 11:48.500

because of the way it went down.

11:51.420 --> 11:52.963
So, I'm thinking
and I ask myself,

11:53.589 --> 11:55.966
why am I sitting
here tossing and turning,

11:56.466 --> 11:57.467
when I know what's,

gotta get done,

11:59.011 --> 12:00.304
is gonna get done!

12:00.888 --> 12:02.556
And Tommy, is gonna fix it.

12:04.516 --> 12:05.809
I'll fix it, I'll talk to him.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.353

12:08.896 --> 12:10.189

beyond the sit down.

this whole fucking mess

12:14.526 --> 12:16.778

under the buss on this one.

12:18.197 --> 12:19.198

12:30.667 --> 12:31.877
[Tom] What do you mean, declare?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.213
[Rudy] Before they get into a
fight with you, they gotta say,

12:34.296 --> 12:35.380
hey man these hands can kill.

12:35.464 --> 12:36.548
Suppose to declare that shit.

fucking mention it.

27:38.242 --> 27:40.577
It happens to everybody,
it's not a big deal.

27:40.869 --> 27:43.121
It's not like I'm gonna do this
shit forever anyways either.

27:44.206 --> 27:47.042
Wait. You're talking about
the bar tending thing in Mexico?

28:01.431 --> 28:02.975
Will totally happen,
you're wrong.

28:03.767 --> 28:04.768
I'm not saying,

28:04.852 --> 28:06.645

couldn't open a bar,

look I'm your biggest fan
here bro, I think you could.

28:09.106 --> 28:10.190
But I don't think you will.

28:10.274 --> 28:11.275
You wanna know why?

28:11.441 --> 28:13.110
Because you don't
think you will bro.

28:13.193 --> 28:14.194
Because you,

28:14.278 --> 28:15.404
you don't believe in you bro.

And in today's

29:20.135 --> 29:22.304
[Tom] How did you ever get
into acting in the first place?

29:23.680 --> 29:25.349
How did I get to dig
up corpses in the middle,

29:25.432 --> 29:26.642
of the desert in
the first place,

29:26.725 --> 29:27.768
that's the fucking question.

29:27.851 --> 29:28.936
[Tom] You know what I mean.

29:29.186 --> 29:30.187

the second I get a TV series,

29:33.357 --> 29:35.484
I won't be digging up
Myster's fucking Canadians,

29:35.567 --> 29:37.736
that's for sure. That's the
one thing I will not be doing.

29:38.070 --> 29:39.279
Your fucking up any jobs,

29:39.363 --> 29:41.323

29:56.588 --> 29:58.340
Yeah bro, well you make
it harder to defend you,

29:58.423 --> 29:59.508
when you're so eager to get a

29:59.591 --> 30:00.717
bullet out of our fucking gun.

30:00.926 --> 30:02.010
Hey I have Zen bro.

30:02.261 --> 30:03.637
I am always fucking Zen,

30:03.720 --> 30:05.305
and I don't need to be liable,

30:05.430 --> 30:07.224
by fucking Myster bro.

30:07.307 --> 30:10.143
I went into Peaches job
with the best of intensions bro.

30:11.186 --> 30:12.855
The best of
intensions for you maybe.

30:12.938 --> 30:13.939
Yeah for me, who else?

30:14.022 --> 30:15.023
Myster!

30:15.816 --> 30:17.693
Well you didn't exactly
help me out there either.

30:18.819 --> 30:20.070
You doing that thing again bro.

30:20.487 --> 30:21.738

30:24.283 --> 30:25.284
I admit that.

30:26.451 --> 30:27.452
and that chump,

30:27.536 --> 30:28.787
he was reaching
for something bro,

30:28.871 --> 30:29.872
and there it is,

30:29.955 --> 30:31.081
life laid out as it was,

30:31.415 --> 30:32.958
and there was no
ill will intended,

30:33.041 --> 30:34.042
at least not on my part.

30:36.879 --> 30:37.880
Yeah.

30:39.256 --> 30:40.507
And like this is our punishment.

30:40.924 --> 30:42.426
Drive out here, and dig up a

what it'll be like?

You couldn't do that,
you'd pussy out.

33:57.204 --> 33:59.122
I'm just saying, hypothetically
if it came to that.

33:59.206 --> 34:00.707
[Rudy] Like if it
had to be that way?

34:00.791 --> 34:01.792
Yeah.

Like if it had to be somebody?

34:10.801 --> 34:12.928
Emphatically not
that cunt, Barry.

34:15.013 --> 34:16.306
At least if they knew you,

34:17.599 --> 34:19.184
they could you know,
notify your family,

34:19.268 --> 34:21.311
so your family wouldn't
always be wondering.

34:21.520 --> 34:22.521
What, my family!

34:22.771 --> 34:24.188
My family would
be like, Rudy who!

34:25.482 --> 34:26.775
I would like to
be buried though.

34:27.568 --> 34:29.194
[Rudy]
Yeah, I'd like that I know that.

34:30.362 --> 34:31.780
Better than being
left out in the open.

34:33.364 --> 34:34.366
[Rudy] Come on man.

34:34.449 --> 34:35.868

forget gloves and a tarp.

34:43.917 --> 34:44.918
Jesus!

34:45.002 --> 34:46.003
Just a second bro.

34:48.380 --> 34:49.380
Just a second.

34:49.547 --> 34:50.632
Just wait a minute Rudy.

34:52.301 --> 34:53.427
What are you freaking out bro.

34:54.553 --> 34:55.554
Yeah, just a little bit.

34:56.346 --> 34:58.473
What because of this?
This happens bro.

34:58.807 --> 34:59.808
Hey shake it off champ.

35:00.434 --> 35:01.435
[Tom] It's gotta be done.

35:02.769 --> 35:03.770
Hey!

35:04.354 --> 35:05.439
Do you believe in God?

35:06.523 --> 35:07.524
What?

35:07.941 --> 35:09.151
[Rudy] Do you
believe in God bro?

35:10.444 --> 35:11.445
No!

35:11.695 --> 35:13.405
I don't know,
what you ask me that for?

35:14.156 --> 35:16.200
I don't know, I'm just
realizing that I don't actually,

35:16.283 --> 35:17.618
know where you
stand on the issue.

35:17.910 --> 35:18.911
Like,

35:18.994 --> 35:19.995
like where is he,

35:20.078 --> 35:21.288
right like his
body's here right.

35:21.622 --> 35:22.623
But where is he at?

35:22.706 --> 35:24.583
I'll tell you where he
is Rudy, he's in the dirt!

35:24.666 --> 35:25.834
That's where he's gonna stay,

35:26.084 --> 35:27.211
he's not going anywhere!

35:27.294 --> 35:28.295
Ok.

35:28.420 --> 35:30.380
Ok! Take it easy, Top Gun.

35:30.839 --> 35:33.050
Forget it, you don't
believe in the afterlife.

35:33.133 --> 35:34.134
Myself,

35:34.218 --> 35:35.219
I'm a believer--

35:35.302 --> 35:36.470
[Tom] You think this is a joke!

35:36.553 --> 35:38.096
Why is that a
fucking joke, Rudy?

35:38.597 --> 35:39.890
[Rudy] I'm not joking bro.

35:40.390 --> 35:42.643
See, you don't even realize
when you're doing that shit.

35:42.768 --> 35:44.144
This is grim work man.

35:44.228 --> 35:45.896
Digging up a body
depresses me to shit,

35:45.979 --> 35:46.980
depresses me!

35:47.064 --> 35:48.815
And you're out here
fucking acting like a clown!

35:49.358 --> 35:50.359
I'm not!

35:50.442 --> 35:51.902
[Tom] I fucking envy you,
you know that!

35:51.985 --> 35:53.570
What are you talking about, huh?

35:53.654 --> 35:54.947
-I fucking envy you man.
-[Rudy] What!

35:55.030 --> 35:56.240
Everything's a joke to you Rudy!

35:56.323 --> 35:57.574
Bro! Look at us!

35:58.075 --> 36:00.035
Look at where we
are right now, huh!

36:00.369 --> 36:02.371
We are in the
middle of the desert!

36:02.663 --> 36:03.789
Digging up a corps,

36:03.872 --> 36:04.873
guess what bro,

36:04.957 --> 36:06.959
it is a fucking joke!

36:07.042 --> 36:08.043
[Tom] Fuck up.

36:08.335 --> 36:10.128
What the fuck is wrong with you?

36:10.796 --> 36:11.797
You got no feelings.

36:13.841 --> 36:15.467
Oh what! You think
I don't feel this huh?

36:15.551 --> 36:16.552
[Rudy] No you don't!

36:16.635 --> 36:17.636
Yoh I feel this bro.

36:17.719 --> 36:18.762
I wear this shit bro!

36:18.846 --> 36:20.681
Don't make me fucking laugh,
no you don't!

36:20.764 --> 36:22.850
Yes I do bro, I do right here!

36:23.058 --> 36:24.935
See this face,
this face right here,

36:25.060 --> 36:26.311
tears of a fucking clown bro!

36:26.395 --> 36:27.646
[Tom] No you don't.

36:27.729 --> 36:28.730
When?

36:29.398 --> 36:30.399
When!

36:30.482 --> 36:32.401
Like when do I get, oh bro!

36:32.526 --> 36:33.694
I get down bro.

36:33.777 --> 36:34.820
Ok, I get down.

36:34.903 --> 36:36.280
Just leave it as that, alright!

36:36.446 --> 36:38.156
The blues descend bro.

36:38.657 --> 36:40.576
No, I'm not talking
about the Oh! I'm sad.

36:40.701 --> 36:42.202
I'm talking about
properly depressed!

36:42.286 --> 36:44.079
When was the last time
you were really depressed?

36:44.496 --> 36:46.081
-Free weed, we be honest here?
-[Tom] Yeah!

36:46.164 --> 36:47.791
Like real deal shit,
Goose to Maverick!

36:47.875 --> 36:49.334
[Tom] Fucking right!
Ok Fine!

36:49.960 --> 36:51.336
-[Rudy] Recently ok.
-[Tom] Recently.

36:51.420 --> 36:52.921
Very recently bro.

36:53.046 --> 36:54.047
Like so recent,

36:54.131 --> 36:56.175
that I don't even know if
I'm out of it bro, how's that!

36:56.425 --> 36:58.260
And you know what,
it fucking scares me.

36:58.343 --> 36:59.553
It scares you.

36:59.636 --> 37:01.221
Oh! No, no, no don't do that!

37:01.430 --> 37:02.848
Don't fucking do that bro!

37:02.931 --> 37:05.017
Goose does not
mock Maverick bro,

37:05.100 --> 37:06.393
if it's too fucking raw.

37:06.476 --> 37:07.477
[Tom] What I say!

37:07.561 --> 37:09.021
You know exactly what you said!

37:09.104 --> 37:10.105
Oh, it scares you.

37:10.189 --> 37:11.523
There was a mocking,
fucking tone.

37:11.607 --> 37:13.984
There wasn't anything
fucking mocking about it.

37:14.067 --> 37:15.277
It's a mocking fucking tone bro!

37:15.360 --> 37:16.653
I get it, I get it!

37:16.737 --> 37:18.614
Suicide is not an easy
subject to talk about.

37:18.739 --> 37:20.532
But don't fucking
mock me for it bro!

37:22.701 --> 37:23.702
Suicide.

37:24.203 --> 37:25.204
-[Rudy] Yeah!
-[Tom] Really?

37:25.287 --> 37:26.288
[Rudy] Yeah!

37:26.622 --> 37:27.748
Yeah really, man!

37:28.582 --> 37:30.417
Tears of a fucking clown bro.

37:31.251 --> 37:32.252
[Tom] I didn't know.

37:32.586 --> 37:33.587
Fuck you!

37:37.966 --> 37:40.010
[Rudy] I spend too
much time on my own bro,

37:40.511 --> 37:41.512
and it just,

37:42.971 --> 37:44.014
just screws me all up.

37:45.724 --> 37:47.684
I actually think this
road trip has been good for me,

37:47.768 --> 37:48.769
you know like,

37:51.688 --> 37:53.315
I like spending
time with you bro.

37:54.024 --> 37:55.025
But you,

37:55.859 --> 37:56.860
you're like,

37:59.279 --> 38:01.782
you're like the only
fucking person I talk to.

38:03.283 --> 38:04.284
Shit!

38:05.744 --> 38:07.079
And you sure as
shit the only person,

38:07.162 --> 38:08.497
I'm gonna show this to, so.

38:12.876 --> 38:14.169
[Tom] How the hell
did this happen?

38:16.463 --> 38:17.464
[Rudy] My,

38:18.215 --> 38:19.216
mail man found me,

38:19.466 --> 38:20.467
can you believe that shit.

38:23.136 --> 38:24.847
Only mail I got that day was my,

38:25.389 --> 38:26.598
issue of road and track.

38:27.140 --> 38:29.560
Like if I hadn't renewed my
subscription to road and track,

38:29.685 --> 38:30.811
I'd be fucking dead right now.

38:31.270 --> 38:32.271
Why didn't you call me?

38:32.354 --> 38:34.022
Because of what you'd think bro,

38:34.231 --> 38:35.232
you know it weakness.

38:35.315 --> 38:36.942
Dude I would've
tried to help maybe.

38:37.025 --> 38:38.694
It's chemical bro, my ma had it,

38:38.777 --> 38:39.778
you couldn't have helped.

38:39.862 --> 38:41.697
-I would've tried.
-I know Tommy, I know.

38:41.780 --> 38:43.115
That's why I'm
telling you know, ok.

38:44.992 --> 38:45.993
Tears of a clown bro.

38:48.287 --> 38:50.330
Rudy, you're a great guy,
you've got a lot to live for.

38:52.374 --> 38:53.375
Fuck!

38:53.458 --> 38:54.459
[Tom] Let it out.

38:54.543 --> 38:55.544
Fuck!

38:55.627 --> 38:57.462
-[Tom] Let it out!
-Fucking road and fucking,

38:57.546 --> 38:58.547

38:58.630 --> 39:00.757

39:15.772 --> 39:16.773
[Tom] Yeah.

39:16.857 --> 39:18.609
I'm done digging bro.
I'm done with digging bro.

39:24.323 --> 39:25.324
It's gonna be ok Rudy.

39:26.450 --> 39:27.451
You're gonna be fine.

39:28.243 --> 39:30.370
You know what, fuck it man
let's just do this another day.

39:30.454 --> 39:31.538
We don't gotta do this today.

39:31.622 --> 39:32.623
[Rudy] I'm done digging.

39:32.706 --> 39:33.999
[Rudy] I'm done
with digging bro.

39:35.918 --> 39:36.919
[Rudy] Hey man,

Another day man, come on.

40:25.008 --> 40:26.301
[Rudy]
Let's go out big tonight bro.

40:27.302 --> 40:28.679
[Rudy]
You know, get some steaks,

40:32.933 --> 40:33.934
[Tom] You and me.

40:34.101 --> 40:35.143
[Rudy] Simplify bro!

40:35.352 --> 40:36.895
[upbeat western music]

41:56.725 --> 41:58.560
[Rudy] He like totally
won't understand ourselves,

41:58.644 --> 42:01.063
You know what I mean,
and who we hang out with,

42:01.146 --> 42:03.524
reflects badly on how
we feel about ourselves.

42:03.607 --> 42:05.234
Why do we hang out
with like one person,

42:05.317 --> 42:07.277
and not another, right.

42:07.778 --> 42:10.822
Because they're like a mirror
to our inner most selves, right.

42:10.906 --> 42:13.325
Like common interest,
yeah whatever right.

42:13.408 --> 42:15.202
But there's something more,

42:15.285 --> 42:17.079
right, what that is,

42:17.162 --> 42:19.331
that might be unknowable,
you know what I'm saying.

42:19.748 --> 42:22.543
But we project
ourselves to the world,

42:22.626 --> 42:23.669
through the shit that we do,

42:23.752 --> 42:25.462
through our
efforts bro, trust me.

42:25.546 --> 42:27.172
Oh! Like this, like golf right!

42:27.256 --> 42:28.382
What the fuck is that.

42:28.465 --> 42:30.425
I mean seriously,
what the fuck is that right.

42:30.509 --> 42:33.220
I mean he hit
a fucking ball, right.

42:33.762 --> 42:34.763
We like.

42:36.098 --> 42:37.099
Hey.

42:38.016 --> 42:39.268
Damn, she's fucking fine.

42:39.685 --> 42:41.103
We hit a ball, right.

42:41.270 --> 42:43.856
Cos we wanna verify
a place in this word right.

42:43.939 --> 42:45.440
So we ask our fellow,

42:45.524 --> 42:46.567
fucking golfers, hey bro,

42:46.650 --> 42:47.734
did I hit that ball good and,

42:48.277 --> 42:49.444
our fellow fucking golfer,

42:49.528 --> 42:51.113
is like yeah you
hit that ball good,

42:51.196 --> 42:52.531
or you hit the ball bad,
or whatever,

42:52.614 --> 42:53.991
I don't fucking play golf right,

42:54.074 --> 42:55.534
but the thing is bro,

42:55.617 --> 42:56.994
it's about seeing ourselves,

42:57.077 --> 42:59.288
to other people,
you know what I'm saying.

43:00.747 --> 43:01.748
Hey.

43:02.624 --> 43:03.959
Why don't you saddle up girl.

43:04.042 --> 43:05.043
What's your name?

43:05.794 --> 43:06.795
Liquorice.

43:06.879 --> 43:08.589
Oh! Yeah it is.

43:08.672 --> 43:09.673
Liquorice what?

43:10.465 --> 43:11.466
Just Liquorice.

43:12.050 --> 43:13.218
It's a pseudo name.

43:13.302 --> 43:14.303
Hmm, well,

43:14.386 --> 43:16.513
just Liquorice,
that is one hell,

43:16.597 --> 43:18.849
of a pseudo name,
you know what I'm saying girl.

43:20.767 --> 43:21.768
Private dance?

43:22.561 --> 43:23.562
Private dance,

43:23.937 --> 43:26.356
private number, private life
together, whatever you want.

43:27.357 --> 43:28.775
Hmm, later bro.

43:35.616 --> 43:36.617
[fireworks noise]

43:36.700 --> 43:37.701
[dance music]

43:43.457 --> 43:46.293
[music drown out talking]

43:46.877 --> 43:48.170
[Liquorice]
Start your engine baby!

43:50.589 --> 43:52.424
Hey! Shut the door in my face!

43:52.508 --> 43:53.509
Yeah!

43:55.719 --> 43:57.012
Hit my fucking forehead.

44:04.186 --> 44:05.354
[sexual noises]

44:35.259 --> 44:36.677
[lonely music]

46:37.297 --> 46:38.549
So you're gonna go to Mexico?

46:40.300 --> 46:41.301
I'm gonna open a bar,

46:41.385 --> 46:42.386
my own place.

46:43.846 --> 46:44.847
What are you gonna call it?

46:46.932 --> 46:47.933
I don't know.

46:49.059 --> 46:50.227
Maybe Tom's Place.

46:50.644 --> 46:51.645
Casa Tom's.

46:51.812 --> 46:53.814
Tom's on the Beach, since it
is gonna be on the beach.

46:53.897 --> 46:54.898
So maybe that.

46:55.774 --> 46:57.359
I've never been to Mexico.

46:57.776 --> 46:58.777
What is it like?

46:58.861 --> 46:59.862
[Tom] No?

47:01.738 --> 47:02.739
I actually don't know

47:02.823 --> 47:03.824
I've never been either.

47:06.034 --> 47:07.035
Oh.

47:08.996 --> 47:10.414
Is it weird that
I wanna open up a bar,

47:10.497 --> 47:11.623
and I've never been to Mexico?

47:15.502 --> 47:17.254
No,

47:18.463 --> 47:19.464
it's very nice.

47:21.091 --> 47:23.093
You will like it I'm sure,
I mean I don't know.

47:24.386 --> 47:26.930
Didn't you have to walk through
it or something to get here?

47:28.932 --> 47:30.726
No, I take a flight.

47:38.483 --> 47:39.484
How's your ice-cream?

47:42.654 --> 47:43.655
Wanna go for a ride?

47:44.865 --> 47:45.866
Ok.

47:45.949 --> 47:47.201
[Tom] Yeah! You sure?

47:47.701 --> 47:48.952
-[Gabriella] Yes.
-[Tom] Ok.

47:51.413 --> 47:53.415
[Tom] Hope on, get on, come on.

47:54.750 --> 47:55.792
Ok.

48:00.172 --> 48:01.590
[Gabriella] I don't
wanna fall off, ok.

48:01.924 --> 48:02.925
[Tom] You won't fall.

48:03.091 --> 48:04.092
I got you.

48:05.302 --> 48:06.303
Just hold on tight.

48:09.014 --> 48:10.015
Alright.

48:10.599 --> 48:11.600
Which way we're going?

48:11.683 --> 48:13.435
-That way.
-This way, ok.

48:13.519 --> 48:14.811
Very precise.

48:16.313 --> 48:17.648
You got bikes in Guatemala?

48:17.731 --> 48:19.525
-They do, go faster.
-Ok, ok.

48:24.863 --> 48:25.864
[Tom] This is nice.

48:26.365 --> 48:27.366
[Gabriella] It's quiet.

48:29.034 --> 48:30.702
Some little bit quiet.

48:32.996 --> 48:34.831
I like to come here to think,

48:34.915 --> 48:35.999
and,

48:37.626 --> 48:38.794
or just sit sometimes.

48:40.379 --> 48:41.380
It's beautiful.

48:45.717 --> 48:47.803
Was your mama
alone when she died?

48:50.180 --> 48:51.431
She had the dog with her.

48:52.474 --> 48:54.017
That's so nice.

48:54.476 --> 48:55.477
Yeah.

48:59.022 --> 49:00.691
I like to think that,

49:02.651 --> 49:04.695
that God put dogs,

49:04.945 --> 49:05.988
here to,

49:06.488 --> 49:07.489
show us,

49:08.782 --> 49:09.783
how to love.

49:11.827 --> 49:13.287
I just think he was hungry.

49:14.496 --> 49:16.206
And what happened
to him, to the dog?

49:17.875 --> 49:19.418
Well right now,
he's with the landlord,

49:19.501 --> 49:21.712
but he doesn't want to
keep him, so I'm not sure.

49:24.047 --> 49:26.008
Why don't you just take him?

49:26.967 --> 49:28.886
Yes, you can take him and,

49:30.512 --> 49:32.472
you know for like company,

49:32.556 --> 49:37.394
and you have a little
piece of your mama with you,

49:38.145 --> 49:40.022
to remember her by.

49:42.816 --> 49:43.817
[Tom] Yeah, I guess.

49:46.069 --> 49:47.362
So you're pretty religious huh?

49:49.865 --> 49:51.408
[Gabriella]
You don't go to church though?

49:52.492 --> 49:54.077
[Tom] No, I'm not religious.

49:56.205 --> 49:57.664
But I do like it
out here, it's nice.

50:03.879 --> 50:04.880
[seagull noises]

50:26.777 --> 50:28.028
[Tom]
So how did your husband die?

50:28.737 --> 50:29.863
[Gabriella] On his motor bike.

50:32.157 --> 50:33.325
[Tom]
How long were you married?

50:33.742 --> 50:34.743
[Gabriella] Three months.

50:34.826 --> 50:36.036
[Tom] Is that why you came here?

50:37.079 --> 50:38.372
[Gabriella] No, not really,

50:39.206 --> 50:40.207
it's very bad there.

50:41.750 --> 50:42.751
[Tom] You ever go back?

50:43.836 --> 50:44.837
No, it's,

50:46.129 --> 50:47.297
too far to walk.

50:47.714 --> 50:48.715
[Tom laughs]

50:49.132 --> 50:50.133
Funny.

50:52.094 --> 50:53.345
[happy music]

51:04.481 --> 51:05.941
It's a workout.

51:20.205 --> 51:21.290
[Tom] Right here.

51:32.134 --> 51:33.135
Ok.

51:35.137 --> 51:36.763
My family's inside so.

51:39.433 --> 51:40.434
I get it.

51:40.934 --> 51:41.935
I had a good time.

51:42.186 --> 51:43.187
I had,

51:43.645 --> 51:44.646
a very good time.

51:46.106 --> 51:47.107
We should do it again.

51:47.482 --> 51:48.483
Yeah.

52:45.040 --> 52:46.041
[dog barking]

53:00.389 --> 53:01.640
I don't have to leave.

53:03.350 --> 53:04.893
I could stick
around for a while.

53:06.770 --> 53:07.771
That'll be nice.

53:08.772 --> 53:09.773
Yeah.

53:14.069 --> 53:15.445
You wanna have
dinner with me tonight?

53:15.904 --> 53:16.947
You can bring your daughter.

53:18.866 --> 53:19.867
Yes.

53:26.415 --> 53:27.583
[casual western continues]

53:36.884 --> 53:37.885
So I'll see you tonight?

53:39.511 --> 53:40.512
Ok.

53:43.015 --> 53:44.600
-Bye.
-Bye.

54:26.099 --> 54:27.434
-Hi Tom.
-Jesus!

54:29.311 --> 54:30.312
How you doing?

54:31.063 --> 54:32.231
[suspenseful music]

54:33.023 --> 54:34.024
I'm ok.

54:34.900 --> 54:35.901
Where you been?

54:36.109 --> 54:37.110
Church.

54:40.197 --> 54:42.866
I see Rudy's in
the room next door too.

54:44.076 --> 54:45.077
Yeah.

54:45.452 --> 54:46.453
I guess.

54:48.914 --> 54:49.915
Funny that.

54:50.499 --> 54:51.500
Yeah.

54:52.125 --> 54:53.126
Yeah.

54:53.794 --> 54:54.795
I think so.

54:55.295 --> 54:56.547
All things considered.

54:58.841 --> 55:00.092
How'd you find us Barry?

55:00.175 --> 55:01.260
Tommy please.

55:02.469 --> 55:03.846
You think I'm not gonna know.

55:04.555 --> 55:05.681
What are you doing here?

55:06.890 --> 55:08.684
What's with the inhospitality?

55:09.643 --> 55:11.144
I just come by to
see what's, what.

55:11.645 --> 55:12.938
To see what the problem is.

55:13.730 --> 55:16.567
No problem, just to a while
to dig up the hole that's all.

55:18.402 --> 55:19.736
Looked deep enough to me.

55:21.572 --> 55:22.573
Yeah.

55:22.698 --> 55:23.699
You been out there?

55:23.782 --> 55:24.783
Yeah.

55:27.411 --> 55:28.412
Well.

55:30.289 --> 55:31.290
So,

55:32.082 --> 55:33.083
[Barry] good?

55:33.166 --> 55:34.168
Yeah, we're good.

55:37.004 --> 55:38.005
Tom!

55:38.714 --> 55:40.799
You don't really have
a choice in the matter.

55:41.049 --> 55:42.050
You see that right?

55:42.759 --> 55:43.760
Alright.

55:43.844 --> 55:45.053
I don't think I can do it.

55:45.137 --> 55:46.138
[Barry] Yeah.

55:46.555 --> 55:48.307
Look, I know we fucked up,
I just don't,

55:48.390 --> 55:49.474
[Barry] Ah-huh!

55:50.726 --> 55:52.311
I just don't think I can do it.

55:53.187 --> 55:54.771
Yeah, I wanna to tell you,

55:55.314 --> 55:56.315
as a friend.

55:57.357 --> 55:58.525
You're gonna do this thing,

55:58.609 --> 55:59.818
or you're gonna die too.

55:59.902 --> 56:02.070
So why don't you stop
your fucking around.

56:05.908 --> 56:06.909
Here.

56:08.744 --> 56:09.745
What's this for?

56:10.621 --> 56:11.705
Hold on to it please.

56:12.372 --> 56:13.665
Give me your hand please.

56:15.417 --> 56:16.710
The other hand please.

56:18.128 --> 56:19.296
[Barry] Give me your left hand,

56:19.379 --> 56:20.923
or I will punch you
in the fucking teeth!

56:21.089 --> 56:22.090
[suspenseful music]

56:25.802 --> 56:27.471
Get off Barry, get off of me.

56:27.554 --> 56:29.097
Use the pillow
if you want to Tom.

56:29.181 --> 56:30.766
[Tom] Get off of me Barry!

56:31.600 --> 56:32.684
[Tom] Get off of me!

56:32.768 --> 56:33.769

56:34.394 --> 56:35.854
[Tom screams]

56:37.105 --> 56:38.190
[Tom screams]

56:40.943 --> 56:41.944
[Tom] Fuck!

56:44.530 --> 56:45.531
[Tom yells]

56:46.114 --> 56:47.115
Fuck!

56:50.494 --> 56:51.662
Fucking dick head!

56:52.079 --> 56:53.080
[Barry] Shh.

56:53.372 --> 56:54.581
It's not that bad really.

56:54.873 --> 56:56.416
My fucking finger!

56:57.960 --> 56:59.920
Come on, don't make
a big deal about it.

57:00.212 --> 57:01.255
Look at the bright side,

57:01.672 --> 57:03.257
at least it's not
your dick right!

57:03.757 --> 57:05.676
Some diggers really get
off on stuff like that.

57:09.429 --> 57:10.722
Here, wipe your hand.

57:13.225 --> 57:14.309
I hear you're retiring?

57:14.893 --> 57:15.894
That's nice.

57:15.978 --> 57:16.979
You got any plans?

57:18.105 --> 57:19.106
Fuck you!

57:19.565 --> 57:21.233
That option's not available Tom.

57:22.526 --> 57:23.527
Well,

57:24.194 --> 57:25.195
good for you anyways.

57:26.488 --> 57:27.489
So Tom,

57:28.073 --> 57:29.074
what I recommend,

57:29.241 --> 57:30.242
is you get this thing done!

57:31.201 --> 57:32.286
[Barry] Get this job done,

57:32.452 --> 57:33.996
and you get the wonderful prize,

57:34.288 --> 57:36.707
being a bar tender on
some fucking beach somewhere.

57:37.416 --> 57:39.960
Why does everyone think I want
to be a fucking bar tender!

57:40.836 --> 57:42.296
Well I thought
that's what you wanna do.

57:42.963 --> 57:45.632
Live on a beach, open a
fucking bar. My own bar.

57:46.049 --> 57:47.843
An ownership position, smart.

57:48.427 --> 57:49.678
I thought it was
just bar tending.

57:50.596 --> 57:51.597
[Barry] Anyway,

57:51.680 --> 57:53.140
you're gonna get
this thing done today.

57:53.765 --> 57:55.601
You'll sleep better
once it's all done.

57:56.226 --> 57:57.227
[Barry] Ok!

57:57.561 --> 57:58.562
Today Tom.

57:59.605 --> 58:00.606
Take care.

[heavy metal music]

58:16.496 --> 58:17.497

58:17.748 --> 58:18.749
Open up.

58:23.337 --> 58:24.630

58:24.713 --> 58:25.881
Liquorice is still asleep man.

58:25.964 --> 58:26.965
Who?

58:27.049 --> 58:28.759
Liquorice, bar girl.
I think she's the one man.

58:28.842 --> 58:30.469
I don't fucking care,
let's go now!

58:30.552 --> 58:32.471

Is that a sock bro?

58:52.324 --> 58:54.159
Yoh, we shouldn't be
digging with that injury man,

58:54.243 --> 58:55.244
you're gonna get infected,

58:55.327 --> 58:56.411
we should go to the hospital.

58:56.495 --> 58:57.496
Let's just fucking go!

58:57.579 --> 58:58.622
No, we seriously should bro.

-Alright!

58:59.998 --> 59:00.999
Let's get it done now!

59:01.083 --> 59:03.168
Yoh, is this fucking about last
night with Liquorice bro?

59:03.252 --> 59:04.753
-Fuck you Rudy!
-It totally is, isn't it!

59:04.837 --> 59:06.547
-It's not about that.
-It's totally about that.

59:06.630 --> 59:07.798
It's not fucking about that!

59:09.049 --> 59:10.259
Just get in the fucking car!

59:19.977 --> 59:21.395

Take you out to fine dining,

59:25.232 --> 59:26.233
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

59:26.316 --> 59:28.360
[Rudy] Old fucking Myster
should be picking up the tab,

59:28.443 --> 59:30.487
for this whole fucking thing,
you know what I'm saying.

59:32.197 --> 59:33.866
[Rudy] You think we
gotta fill this whole bag?

59:33.949 --> 59:35.701
We're not here to
move the kid from Montreal.

59:35.868 --> 59:36.869
What?

59:36.952 --> 59:37.953
[Tom] I'm sorry.

59:38.036 --> 59:39.413
-Tommy!
-I'm sorry Rudy.

59:39.580 --> 59:40.956
-Bro!
-Put your hands up!

59:42.958 --> 59:43.959
[Rudy] But why?

59:44.710 --> 59:45.794
Fine! Put them down.

59:46.378 --> 59:47.379
Get in the hole!

59:47.504 --> 59:48.797
[Tom]
Get in the fucking hole, Rudy!

59:48.881 --> 59:49.965
[Rudy] Ok bro, ok!

59:50.174 --> 59:51.216
I'm sorry, look I,

59:51.300 --> 59:52.301

59:54.011 --> 59:55.137
I'm sorry

59:55.220 --> 59:56.930
No Rudy. Peaches,
and there was money involved,

59:57.014 --> 59:58.015
real fucking money.

59:58.098 --> 59:59.766
And they don't like to
lose their money Rudy,

59:59.850 --> 01:00:00.851

01:00:00.934 --> 01:00:02.227
Wait! You doing
this for Myster bro?

01:00:02.603 --> 01:00:03.604
You're fucking killing me,

01:00:03.687 --> 01:00:05.731
because he's outta pocket
a few fucking shackles bro?

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:07.691
I got no choice.

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:10.736
Hey bro, we never
promised them fuck all bro.

01:00:10.903 --> 01:00:11.904
We said we had like,

01:00:11.987 --> 01:00:13.530
this thing, like an idea bro.

01:00:13.697 --> 01:00:14.948
We said that it
could work right.

01:00:15.032 --> 01:00:16.116
We used the word could bro.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.576
He knew there was
risk involved right.

01:00:17.659 --> 01:00:19.661
-I don't wanna hear it!
-You were fucking with me.

01:00:19.745 --> 01:00:21.163
I don't wanna
fucking hear it Rudy.

01:00:21.246 --> 01:00:22.247
Bro, ok relax.

01:00:22.331 --> 01:00:23.373
Ok relax, just chill.

01:00:23.457 --> 01:00:24.833
I don't wanna fucking hear it.

01:00:25.083 --> 01:00:26.710
-Ok
-I got no choice!

01:00:26.793 --> 01:00:27.794
You got choices here,

01:00:27.878 --> 01:00:29.463
we got choices,
we all got choices alright.

01:00:29.546 --> 01:00:30.547
Look I get it.

01:00:30.631 --> 01:00:32.424

a tough sitchie alright.

01:00:32.508 --> 01:00:33.675
But look, look,

01:00:34.009 --> 01:00:35.260
Please let's just

01:00:35.344 --> 01:00:36.345
No Rudy! No!

01:00:36.428 --> 01:00:37.638
You can't fucking hold no!

01:00:37.721 --> 01:00:38.889
Ok, ok! For a second,

01:00:38.972 --> 01:00:39.973

01:00:41.016 --> 01:00:42.226

01:10:03.537 --> 01:10:05.038
Why don't you go
out to the desert,

01:10:05.205 --> 01:10:06.623
you fucking piece of shit,

01:10:06.915 --> 01:10:07.916
and you dig up Rudy.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.127
And you cut off his dick,
or his fucking hands,

01:10:10.252 --> 01:10:11.837
or whatever fucking
body parts you want!

01:10:12.004 --> 01:10:13.505
Or you have Barry do it,
that fuck!

01:10:13.672 --> 01:10:14.965
You have him fucking do it.

01:10:22.347 --> 01:10:23.390
Ok Tom look,

01:10:23.473 --> 01:10:24.474
let's just,

01:10:24.933 --> 01:10:26.393
let's just back
this up a bit ok.

01:10:28.312 --> 01:10:29.438
I agree, I was,

01:10:29.813 --> 01:10:30.814
being,

01:10:31.148 --> 01:10:32.441
aggressive and,

01:10:35.736 --> 01:10:37.029
you said you did it, you did it.

01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:41.491
I understand you had
a little tussle with Barry.

01:10:44.203 --> 01:10:46.121
He cut off my fucking finger!

01:10:46.371 --> 01:10:47.372
Ok that,

01:10:47.456 --> 01:10:48.582
is unacceptable!

01:10:49.958 --> 01:10:51.126
Unfucking acceptable.

01:10:52.503 --> 01:10:53.504
You know Barry though,

01:10:53.962 --> 01:10:54.963
he's a free wheeler.

01:10:55.506 --> 01:10:56.673
You can't control that guy.

01:10:57.257 --> 01:10:58.717
But I did not authorize that,

01:10:59.092 --> 01:11:00.093
Tommy.

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:01.261
Losing your finger,

01:11:02.137 --> 01:11:03.263
I did not authorize that.

01:11:06.225 --> 01:11:07.267
I'm fucking handicapped,

01:11:07.351 --> 01:11:09.228
I got no baby finger anymore.

01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:12.105
Like I said, Tom.
The guy's got a mind of his own.

01:11:12.189 --> 01:11:14.358
I don't want you feeling half
cocked about the whole thing.

01:11:15.234 --> 01:11:16.235
Ok. Let's,

01:11:16.777 --> 01:11:17.819
let's just chop this one up,

01:11:17.903 --> 01:11:18.904

Uh-huh.

01:11:29.331 --> 01:11:30.332
Not ideal,

01:11:30.415 --> 01:11:31.416
it's not ideal.

01:11:32.084 --> 01:11:33.210
But, let's accept it.

01:11:33.752 --> 01:11:35.003
[Mr. Myster]
You lost the finger,

01:11:35.671 --> 01:11:37.047
and that's gotta
cost for something.

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:38.340
Maybe buys you
a little leniency,

01:11:38.507 --> 01:11:40.050
in the whole policy thing.

01:11:42.761 --> 01:11:44.471
I wish you all the
success in your bar tending.

01:11:46.431 --> 01:11:47.850
I'm not a fucking bar tender!

01:11:49.351 --> 01:11:50.352
Ok.

01:11:51.603 --> 01:11:52.604

01:12:51.788 --> 01:12:53.207

Oh no Senor,

No, my cousin.
