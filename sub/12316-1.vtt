WEBVTT

03:15.070 --> 03:17.154
- This is Pete.
- Yeah?

03:19.533 --> 03:20.700
We lost him.

03:21.535 --> 03:25.872
He's your brother, Ross. If you can't
find him, we have people who will.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.333
And you're paying for the contract.

04:44.660 --> 04:47.328
Excuse me.
Have you got a message for Mr. Ross?

04:47.496 --> 04:48.996
What room, sir?

04:49.247 --> 04:50.456
I'm not a guest.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.416
- I'll check.
- Thanks.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.384
- That's Johnny Ross.
- Yes, sir.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.056
Sorry, sir, nothing.

05:07.516 --> 05:08.808
Nothing?

05:09.059 --> 05:11.435
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure, sir.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.940
Okay, thanks.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.838
Thank you.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.816
Yes, I'm sure it was him.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.944
Sunshine Cab, 6912.

06:09.786 --> 06:13.122
- Would you pull up? I want to make a call.
- Right.

07:13.683 --> 07:14.850
Yeah?

07:15.102 --> 07:16.435
Delgetti.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.938
- What is it?
- Work.

07:21.525 --> 07:23.526
Frank, let me in, will you?

07:53.932 --> 07:57.101
What time did you get to bed
this morning, Frank?

07:57.894 --> 07:59.311
About 5.

08:15.579 --> 08:17.413
"Mumps vaccine on the market."

08:17.581 --> 08:19.373
"The government authorized yesterday..."

08:19.541 --> 08:23.460
"...what officials term the first clearly
effective vaccine to prevent mumps."

08:26.756 --> 08:30.092
"...Announced it has granted
a license for the vaccine..."

08:35.432 --> 08:37.600
"at 12:45, Wednesday..."

08:37.767 --> 08:41.937
Why don't you just relax, have
your orange juice, and shut up, Delgetti?

08:45.942 --> 08:47.610
Let's go, Frank.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.007
Lt. Bullitt to see you, Mr. Chalmers.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.970
Conditions in our local politics here.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.972
It was purely unintentional, I assure you.

09:58.139 --> 10:02.017
It wasn't that I was so well-informed,
it was just that he was so ill-informed.

10:02.185 --> 10:04.395
Would you excuse me
for a moment, please?

10:11.194 --> 10:12.987
What do you like about...?

10:13.154 --> 10:17.199
In Orinda, we have all this beautiful
dry sunshine. Absolutely perfect for roses.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.202
I do all my own work.
You should see my hands from pruning.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.539
Hello. Lieutenant, how are you?

10:25.208 --> 10:27.793
Thanks for coming over.
The name is Frank, isn't it?

10:27.961 --> 10:30.212
- That's right.
- Please call me Walter.

10:34.467 --> 10:38.345
I have an important job for you.
Capt. Bennet suggested that you take it.

10:38.513 --> 10:42.099
As you know, there is a senate
subcommittee hearing here Monday.

10:42.392 --> 10:45.060
I have a star witness
who needs protection.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.771
Sam said that
you were the man for the job.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.858
And I can't find a flaw in that statement.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.776
Protection from who?

10:54.154 --> 10:55.779
The Organization.

10:55.947 --> 10:59.241
His name is Ross.
Johnny Ross from Chicago.

11:00.577 --> 11:04.246
Once and for all, the top men
in law enforcement are united.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.874
We're going to expose the Organization.

11:07.042 --> 11:10.252
I read your speech. Why San Francisco?

11:10.837 --> 11:13.756
Ross is safer here. That's your province.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.717
Keeping him out of reach for 40 hours.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.093
Where?

11:18.261 --> 11:22.765
The Hotel Daniels.
226 Embarcadero Road. Room 634.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.809
He's there now, expecting you.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.563
Now that you know where my house is...

11:29.731 --> 11:32.649
...I hope that we'll get to see
a lot more of each other.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.319
Particularly in view of the investigation.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.363
A senatorial hearing has a way of...

11:37.530 --> 11:40.699
...catapulting everyone involved
into the public eye...

11:40.867 --> 11:43.786
...with a subsequent
effect on one's career.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.456
It will be a pleasure to have you along.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.251
Have him in court on Monday, Frank.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.519
- What was that all about?
- Pals.

12:08.686 --> 12:11.480
You and Chalmers? That's a lot of juice.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.774
Hotel Daniels, 226 Embarcadero Road.

12:13.942 --> 12:16.485
State's evidence witness,
we're babysitting. Let's go.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.695
- You got any coffee?
- Yeah.

13:08.872 --> 13:10.247
- Yeah, who is it?
- Police.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.207
The roof and the exits.

13:22.886 --> 13:26.138
Mr. Chalmers said you'd be here by 5: 00.
He guaranteed me that.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.599
Sorry, we got held up in traffic.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.393
Got any firearms?

13:31.728 --> 13:36.231
No, man, I got nothing on me.
Just my wallet, cigarette lighter.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.484
Want to check me out yourself?

13:38.651 --> 13:42.613
No, that's not necessary. Put that
stuff on the bed, will you, please?

13:45.742 --> 13:48.410
How did you get here from Chicago?

13:48.953 --> 13:50.412
I flew.

13:51.706 --> 13:54.958
Sure none of the boys were on the plane
with you, or saw you get on?

13:55.126 --> 13:56.960
How would I know? I wouldn't know.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.921
Why did you pick this room to hole up?

13:59.088 --> 14:01.381
I didn't pick it. Chalmers picked it.

14:01.549 --> 14:02.591
Why?

14:02.800 --> 14:05.636
Stay away from those windows.
That's why.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.266
Say, look...

14:11.434 --> 14:14.728
Sit down and relax, Ross.
It's a long wait until Monday morning.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.939
We'd better get a fix on some food.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.107
- What?
- Some food.

14:20.109 --> 14:23.403
I know Chalmers wants you to be happy.
We'll do the best we can.

14:23.780 --> 14:24.821
Dad, it's for you.

14:24.989 --> 14:28.992
Listen, you're not going.
We're going to a movie.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.539
Hold it down. Don't be too late.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.084
- Hello.
- Hello. Captain?

14:37.252 --> 14:39.628
- Frank?
- We'll see you later, Dad.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.588
I've seen Chalmers.

14:42.131 --> 14:45.175
- What do you know about Ross?
- Chicago. It could be very big.

14:45.343 --> 14:49.304
He had access to all the records. He ran
the wire services with his brother, Pete.

14:49.472 --> 14:50.764
Did Chalmers ask for me?

14:53.601 --> 14:54.893
Do you happen to know why?

14:55.270 --> 14:58.313
Yes, I know why.
He's grooming himself for public office.

14:58.982 --> 15:02.109
You make good copy.
They love you in the papers, Frank.

15:02.277 --> 15:03.652
I see.

15:03.987 --> 15:06.196
Okay. So long, Sam.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.951
Say, who were you talking to about me
on that telephone?

15:11.160 --> 15:13.745
Mr. Chalmers said
this was just between me and him.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.998
Me and him, man, that's all.

15:17.292 --> 15:21.044
Delgetti will take the first shift,
Stanton at 12: 00. I'll take the third.

15:21.212 --> 15:24.006
All you got to worry about
is staying away from the windows.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.592
Especially at night.
You call me before you leave.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.176
Excuse me.

15:40.231 --> 15:42.357
Fire escape and the freeway.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.569
- Bad news, right?
- Right. Want me to stay?

15:45.737 --> 15:47.446
No. Go on home to your wife.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.448
- What shift?
- Second.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.659
If we work on the weekend,
we get two days off?

15:53.578 --> 15:54.870
So long.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.593
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.935
Is this the new fountain?

16:20.563 --> 16:24.066
Fountain? All the client can afford
is a leaky faucet.

16:25.068 --> 16:28.236
I thought that money didn't matter
to artists.

16:28.613 --> 16:31.031
It costs money to have a soul.

16:32.075 --> 16:35.327
"Friction loss of water in feet
per hundred feet. Length of pipe..."

16:35.495 --> 16:39.373
"Formula using constant one-hundred size
of standard pipe in inches."

16:39.540 --> 16:41.708
I want to use
600 gallons of water per minute.

16:41.876 --> 16:45.420
Now, what's the velocity per second
of a 5-inch pipe?

16:50.760 --> 16:52.636
Look to the extreme right.

16:52.804 --> 16:55.639
Now go down the figures
until you find 600.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.351
Got it.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.646
Now go across
until you find the 5-inch-pipe column.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.440
- What does it say?
- 9.8.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.234
Now I want the loss in feet.

17:10.780 --> 17:11.946
Feet?

17:14.492 --> 17:15.534
Well?

17:15.702 --> 17:18.619
I lost my place. Nobody's perfect.

17:26.087 --> 17:29.840
- May I use your phone, please?
- Good evening. It's right this way.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.803
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.976
- Yeah?
- Del?

17:41.644 --> 17:45.147
Coffee Cantata. 931-0770.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.191
- 931-0770.
- Right.

17:49.193 --> 17:52.821
If a Sgt. Delgetti calls me,
would you please let me know right away?

17:52.989 --> 17:54.990
- I certainly will.
- Thank you.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.647
- Yes?
- Del. I'm coming off now.

19:51.065 --> 19:53.275
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, sure.

19:55.069 --> 19:56.945
Hold it down, will you?

19:57.613 --> 19:58.989
I'm sorry.

20:06.455 --> 20:09.749
- Anything for Stanton?
- No, I'll see you tomorrow.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.975
Who was it?

20:32.982 --> 20:34.900
Something exciting?

20:35.151 --> 20:36.651
Go to sleep.

20:37.653 --> 20:40.155
Meaning you won't tell me anything.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.742
It's not for you, baby.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.331
Anything you do is part of me.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.886
Front desk. Two gentlemen.
Shall I send them up?

21:45.680 --> 21:48.348
- What are their names?
- Hold on a minute.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.395
Mr. Chalmers and a friend.

21:57.233 --> 22:00.652
Listen, tell them to wait.
And give me 421-7596.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.124
- Frank?
- Yeah.

22:14.291 --> 22:17.293
Chalmers is downstairs with another man.
They want to come up.

22:18.671 --> 22:22.298
Chalmers, at 1:00 a.m.? Don't let them in.
I'll be there in five minutes.

22:22.466 --> 22:23.842
All right.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.927
Please, away from the door.

22:26.095 --> 22:28.138
Here are the latest
baseball scores, just in.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.473
In the National League,
San Francisco Giants...

22:30.641 --> 22:32.892
...beat the Dodgers in both ends
of a double-header.

22:33.060 --> 22:36.855
A 2-0 shutout in the twilighter,
and a 4-1 win in the nightcap.

22:52.455 --> 22:53.955
No, wait.

22:54.457 --> 22:55.874
Now look.

22:58.252 --> 22:59.753
He told me...

24:00.022 --> 24:01.856
Holy mackerel!

24:13.702 --> 24:16.579
- Who is it?
- Ross. Two guys got him with a shotgun.

24:16.747 --> 24:17.747
And Stanton?

24:17.915 --> 24:20.208
They got him in the leg.
They're bringing him down.

24:20.376 --> 24:22.043
Stick with Ross. Barney.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.879
As soon as the lab men
get out of 634, seal it.

24:25.047 --> 24:27.298
- But seal it, Barney.
- Yes, sir.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.195
- How bad?
- Bad. He's got a bleeder.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.879
The door is not open.

25:48.297 --> 25:50.965
Somebody screwed up.
The door's not open.

25:51.133 --> 25:52.800
Somebody put the bed in.

26:19.745 --> 26:21.788
I know you're hurting...

26:21.956 --> 26:23.957
...but I've got to know now.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.834
The two men. Do you remember anything?

26:29.505 --> 26:30.922
Caucasian.

26:32.007 --> 26:35.343
The one who fired, about 5' 10".
White hair.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.763
Gun, Winchester pump.

26:40.349 --> 26:42.767
All I remember. Came in so fast.

26:47.022 --> 26:49.857
Chain was off. He unlocked the door.

26:50.025 --> 26:51.192
Who unlocked it?

26:51.360 --> 26:53.987
Ross. Like he was expecting someone.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.615
How is my leg?

26:58.367 --> 27:01.536
Hold on, Carl,
we'll be there in a couple of minutes.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.692
Get out of the way.

27:35.863 --> 27:37.363
To the right.

27:45.706 --> 27:47.081
Let's go.

27:50.461 --> 27:51.919
Scissors, Jones.

27:53.589 --> 27:56.007
Somebody get the blood pressure.

27:56.425 --> 27:57.675
Oxygen.

28:00.471 --> 28:02.430
Can I have an ABD pad?

28:07.019 --> 28:10.229
Can you move your hand?
Do you want to step out?

28:10.397 --> 28:13.107
Your buddy's all right.
His leg's gonna be okay.

28:13.275 --> 28:15.068
Somebody get x-rays.

28:17.988 --> 28:19.238
How's Stanton?

28:19.406 --> 28:22.408
He'll be all right, but
he's busted up. Ross?

28:22.576 --> 28:24.369
I don't know, Frank.

28:25.162 --> 28:28.206
You better call Stanton's wife
and get her over here.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.499
Okay.

28:34.838 --> 28:38.883
Intercostal vessels, move them away.
Suture ligature.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.260
- Here you go.
- What is it?

28:41.428 --> 28:42.595
3-0.

28:42.763 --> 28:45.640
- What's his blood pressure now?
- Scissors.

28:46.725 --> 28:50.144
It's down to 90 over 70.
Started the blood line.

28:53.399 --> 28:54.690
Suture.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.192
Kelly.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.028
Scissors.

29:00.989 --> 29:03.324
- Better let me tie this one.
- Okay.

29:07.496 --> 29:09.288
Get some balm, please.

29:10.958 --> 29:12.125
Here you go.

29:12.292 --> 29:15.711
He's dropping. Pulse is also going up now.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.549
What was it pre-op?

29:20.300 --> 29:23.302
- BP pre-op was 140 over 90.
- Kahn, take this.

29:23.470 --> 29:26.013
- Now it's 90 over 70.
- How much blood do you have?

29:26.181 --> 29:29.350
We have four up here,
and we've ordered four more units.

29:30.561 --> 29:32.353
How much have you given him?

29:32.521 --> 29:36.691
- We're starting the first one right now.
- You'd better bring me another one.

29:37.443 --> 29:38.943
Mayo, please.

29:45.951 --> 29:49.370
- This is the subclavian.
- Here's your wipe, doctor.

29:49.913 --> 29:51.622
Thank you, Deanne.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.046
- 2-0 Dermalon.
- Yes, sir.

30:04.470 --> 30:07.388
- What are his chances?
- No more than fifty-fifty.

30:07.556 --> 30:11.184
We stopped the hemorrhaging, but they
got some of the major blood vessels.

30:11.351 --> 30:12.894
Thank you, doctor.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.298
- How is he doing?
- Holding.

31:25.092 --> 31:27.885
- Stanton?
- Okay. He's sleeping now.

31:28.679 --> 31:30.555
I want to talk to you.

31:40.941 --> 31:42.817
I got the report back from the lab.

31:42.985 --> 31:45.486
Nothing at the hotel.
How come they got in?

31:45.654 --> 31:49.240
Ross got to the door,
unhooked the chain from the inside.

31:50.325 --> 31:54.495
He let the killers in himself?
Why would he do a thing like that?

31:55.330 --> 31:57.415
I'm waiting to ask him.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.668
What about the setup?
What do you think about that?

32:00.836 --> 32:03.629
Shotgun and a backup man. Professionals.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.631
Yep.

32:15.142 --> 32:17.101
I had to call Chalmers.

32:18.478 --> 32:19.520
And?

32:19.688 --> 32:22.356
It didn't go down too good.
It's the main event for him.

32:22.524 --> 32:24.650
You know,
the senate subcommittee hearing.

32:24.818 --> 32:27.361
He can't produce the big surprise
he promised everyone.

32:27.529 --> 32:30.865
He may try to make up some mileage
by laying it on us.

32:32.242 --> 32:34.619
Play it by the book from now on.

32:36.163 --> 32:38.497
Does Chalmers run this case, or do I?

32:38.665 --> 32:41.042
All I'm interested in is results.

32:41.209 --> 32:43.502
Do whatever you think is best.

32:46.506 --> 32:48.549
I'll try to back you up.

33:05.275 --> 33:08.569
Excuse me, sir.
Are you the policeman who hasn't eaten?

33:08.737 --> 33:10.112
Yes, ma'am.

33:10.572 --> 33:12.281
- Thank you.
- Surely.

33:37.391 --> 33:38.849
Where is he?

34:00.789 --> 34:02.081
How is he, doctor?

34:02.249 --> 34:05.626
As well as can be expected.
He's still under the anesthesia.

34:05.794 --> 34:06.794
I'm Walter Chalmers.

34:06.962 --> 34:10.715
Is there any possibility of my getting
a deposition from Ross before Monday?

34:10.882 --> 34:14.844
That's impossible to say at this time.
He may remain in shock.

34:15.929 --> 34:18.764
I thank you for doing all you can, doctor.

34:21.851 --> 34:23.643
Get the supervisor.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.614
Now, what went wrong, lieutenant?

34:37.324 --> 34:39.952
- Who else knew where he was?
- What?

34:41.079 --> 34:43.121
Who else knew where he was?

34:43.915 --> 34:45.750
What are you implying?

34:45.917 --> 34:49.962
They knew where to look for him,
and they used your name to get in.

34:52.174 --> 34:55.384
Are you suggesting
I disclosed his whereabouts?

34:55.594 --> 34:59.013
Somebody did. And it didn't come from us.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.016
That's hardly the issue.

35:03.477 --> 35:05.519
Well, it certainly is.

35:06.980 --> 35:09.648
I've got an officer with a family.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.360
And he's shot up pretty bad.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.364
And I've got a witness who can't talk.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.994
I want to know about Ross.
What was the deal you made with him?

35:22.162 --> 35:23.287
Deal?

35:25.457 --> 35:28.834
Lieutenant, don't try to evade
the responsibility.

35:29.336 --> 35:32.171
In your parlance, you blew it.

35:33.215 --> 35:35.216
You knew the significance
of his testimony.

35:35.383 --> 35:38.886
Yet you failed to take
adequate measures to protect him.

35:39.054 --> 35:41.639
So to you it was a job. No more.

35:42.766 --> 35:47.311
Were it more, and you had the dedication
I was led to believe...

35:48.021 --> 35:50.022
You believe what you want.

35:50.190 --> 35:53.692
You work your side of the street,
and I'll work mine.

35:57.906 --> 36:01.617
Lieutenant, I shall personally officiate
at your public crucifixion...

36:01.785 --> 36:04.578
...if Ross doesn't recover
during the course of the hearing...

36:04.746 --> 36:06.997
...so I can at least
present his deposition.

36:07.165 --> 36:11.752
And I assure you, I shall not suffer
the consequence of your incompetence.

36:12.045 --> 36:14.380
And even if there wasn't any...

36:15.048 --> 36:18.592
...I'm rather certain
I can prove negligence on your part.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.766
There may be another attempt on his life.

36:25.934 --> 36:29.311
I'll be back in the morning,
with my people.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.108
Thank you, doctor.

36:43.994 --> 36:48.038
I'd like to have Dr. Willard replaced.
I think he's too young and inexperienced.

36:48.206 --> 36:51.000
I'd prefer my surgeon.
Inform the administrator, please.

36:51.167 --> 36:54.795
- But Dr. Willard is one of our...
- I'd like him replaced, if you don't mind.

36:54.963 --> 36:58.757
- I'll report this to our administrator.
- Thank you very much.

37:41.134 --> 37:42.343
Doctor?

37:42.510 --> 37:44.803
A relative of mine,
he's here with a gunshot wound.

37:44.971 --> 37:47.014
Could you please tell me
where I can find him?

37:47.182 --> 37:50.434
- Why don't you try at the reception desk?
- There's no one there.

37:50.602 --> 37:53.228
He could be on the second floor
in the emergency room.

37:53.396 --> 37:54.980
Thanks, doctor.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.406
Yes?

38:05.158 --> 38:07.284
Lieutenant, it's for you.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.376
Thank you.

38:16.252 --> 38:17.336
Yes?

38:17.504 --> 38:20.214
Dr. Kenner. This probably
isn't important...

38:20.382 --> 38:24.593
...but a man asked me if a relative of his
with a gunshot wound was in the hospital.

38:24.761 --> 38:26.762
I thought you should know about it.

38:27.597 --> 38:29.431
Was he about 5' 10"? Gray hair?

38:30.433 --> 38:33.060
I'm afraid I told him
that he was on the second floor.

38:33.228 --> 38:34.603
Thank you.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.110
Delgetti.

38:41.277 --> 38:44.113
Our man is in the building.
He was tipped where to find Ross.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.949
- You take the ground floor, okay?
- Got it.

38:53.081 --> 38:57.042
Get in Ross' room. Nobody in,
except Dr. Willard and the nurses.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.133
There's a man down the stairs!

43:18.513 --> 43:21.765
Polly, call Anesthesia
and bring the crash cart.

43:24.269 --> 43:27.271
Doctor, there's a cardiac
arrest in the ICU.

44:00.555 --> 44:03.140
Get Delgetti.
You and the patrolman cover the lobby.

44:03.308 --> 44:04.433
Okay.

44:10.940 --> 44:13.108
I can't get a blood pressure.

44:13.276 --> 44:14.401
Go.

44:15.653 --> 44:18.238
Do you want to defibrillate again?

44:19.073 --> 44:21.450
Not now. Not with that complex.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.665
- How much bicarb?
- Fifteen.

44:28.833 --> 44:30.167
Go ahead. Push it in.

44:30.335 --> 44:33.086
- Do you want some lactose?
- Draw some up.

44:33.254 --> 44:36.840
- Any pupillary reaction?
- No. Dilated and fixed.

44:40.303 --> 44:42.429
Get some calcium up, too.

44:50.521 --> 44:53.023
What's that now? What's he got?

44:54.609 --> 44:56.109
No activity.

44:58.029 --> 45:00.197
I need some more epinephrine.

45:01.449 --> 45:03.492
0.5 milligram, please.

45:19.384 --> 45:22.469
Doctor, I need your help.

45:23.221 --> 45:24.721
What is it?

45:28.059 --> 45:29.559
I want this kept open.

45:29.727 --> 45:32.646
If Chalmers finds out that Ross died,
he'll fold this up.

45:32.814 --> 45:35.690
- I want the man that killed him.
- I understand.

45:35.858 --> 45:39.319
- But I don't want your head on a block.
- I understand.

45:40.071 --> 45:42.656
His chart could be misplaced.

45:43.533 --> 45:47.119
You filed it. It's missing.
I'll take the responsibility.

45:51.207 --> 45:52.666
All right.

46:03.511 --> 46:06.680
Call the coroner's office.
Tell them to put Ross under a John Doe.

46:06.848 --> 46:10.517
I want a private ambulance, unmarked,
and I want it quiet.

46:53.644 --> 46:55.645
Far as you go, doctor.

46:56.981 --> 46:58.607
Take it slow.

47:16.417 --> 47:18.835
City morgue. Let's go.

48:54.348 --> 48:55.765
Fresh today.

50:05.795 --> 50:10.382
See if Dr. Willard is still in the
hospital. Get Lt. Bullitt on the phone.

50:16.430 --> 50:19.933
I'm sorry, Joe.
He's been transferred to another room.

50:21.811 --> 50:23.478
May I have an outside line, please?

50:23.646 --> 50:27.691
- May I speak to your supervisor, please?
- I'm afraid she's busy at the moment.

50:27.858 --> 50:32.195
I'd be grateful if you'd tell her that
Chalmers wishes to see her immediately.

50:32.363 --> 50:35.156
- It's very urgent.
- Yes, Mr. Chalmers.

50:39.328 --> 50:43.081
I'd like to speak
with Dr. Willard, please. Thank you.

50:54.301 --> 50:56.136
Yes? Can I help you?

50:56.595 --> 50:58.054
I wanted the other supervisor.

50:58.222 --> 51:00.473
The night supervisor went off duty
an hour ago.

51:00.641 --> 51:02.851
I'm Mrs. Francis. May I help you?

51:03.018 --> 51:06.980
You may, indeed. There was
a patient here. His name is Johnny Ross.

51:07.148 --> 51:10.233
- And he seems to have disappeared.
- Disappeared?

51:10.401 --> 51:14.529
He was in Intensive Care, but there's no
record of his whereabouts in the hospital.

51:14.697 --> 51:16.030
That's impossible.

51:16.198 --> 51:19.492
- May I see his medical chart?
- I'm sorry but hospital regulations...

51:19.660 --> 51:23.288
It's an official police request.
Is it not, Capt. Baker?

51:24.832 --> 51:28.793
- Yes, captain. I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

51:29.837 --> 51:33.006
Excuse me,
but Dr. Willard has gone off duty.

51:33.340 --> 51:35.133
Call him at home.

51:36.218 --> 51:40.513
- Are you sure he's not there?
- Do you have Dr. Willard's home number?

51:40.681 --> 51:42.223
- Dr. Willard?
- Yes.

51:42.558 --> 51:46.311
I'm sorry, but there's been some
medical complication with my witness.

51:46.479 --> 51:49.022
I'm afraid I'll have to forego
that bedside picture...

51:49.190 --> 51:52.692
...as much as it would've compensated
for his inability to testify tomorrow.

51:52.860 --> 51:55.904
But in all decency,
I can hardly force the issue.

51:56.822 --> 52:00.200
Does this mean your surprise witness
won't be able to make any statement?

52:00.367 --> 52:02.744
The man was near death
when he was brought in here.

52:02.912 --> 52:04.537
In view of the attempt on his life...

52:04.705 --> 52:06.998
...I'm sure you can understand
my reasons for secrecy.

52:07.166 --> 52:09.834
- Yeah, of course.
- Good to see you again.

52:12.338 --> 52:15.423
- Can't reach Lt. Bullitt, either.
- Keep trying.

52:15.925 --> 52:19.969
I can't find Mr. Ross's medical chart.
It's evidently been misplaced.

52:20.137 --> 52:21.888
- Or appropriated.
- Appropriated?

52:22.056 --> 52:25.058
All right. I'll inform the administrator.
Thank you very much.

52:27.937 --> 52:31.064
I want a complete list of the staff
who might've been involved...

52:31.232 --> 52:33.483
...in helping Bullitt spirit Johnny Ross
out of here.

52:33.651 --> 52:36.736
I'm certain he grabbed my witness
for his personal aggrandizement.

52:36.904 --> 52:38.738
- I'll lay odds on that.
- And find Ross.

52:38.906 --> 52:42.617
- I'll get on it right away.
- Mr. Chalmers, I have Lt. Bullitt.

52:48.207 --> 52:50.416
All right, where's my witness?

52:51.293 --> 52:52.502
I've got him.

52:53.045 --> 52:54.587
Where is he?

52:55.464 --> 52:57.590
Are you going to tell me or not?

52:58.425 --> 53:00.468
Well, I can't at the present time.

53:02.137 --> 53:05.181
Capt. Baker would like
to have a word with you.

53:08.269 --> 53:10.603
Now listen to me, lieutenant.

53:13.315 --> 53:15.900
- Nail him. I want him written off.
- No problem.

53:21.782 --> 53:23.783
You want some breakfast?

53:24.285 --> 53:25.785
Just coffee.

54:17.004 --> 54:18.379
Thank you.

54:20.841 --> 54:22.133
For what?

54:40.694 --> 54:41.694
All clear, lieutenant.

54:41.862 --> 54:43.696
- Is it open?
- The door's open, sir.

56:03.277 --> 56:07.113
Think back to the time the two of them
first came in and you saw them.

56:07.281 --> 56:08.990
Anything you can remember?

56:09.783 --> 56:13.119
Like I said, they hit me
before I got a chance to look at them.

56:13.287 --> 56:15.955
I don't remember nothing
about them. Nothing.

56:16.999 --> 56:19.667
- Start remembering.
- I can't.

56:20.586 --> 56:22.128
And that's the honest truth.

56:22.296 --> 56:24.505
Delgetti, take him downtown.

56:25.132 --> 56:27.967
Lieutenant, give him a chance, will you?
He's trying.

56:28.135 --> 56:30.261
He's not trying hard enough.

56:31.263 --> 56:33.014
It will come to him.

56:34.641 --> 56:36.642
You're wasting your time.

56:42.483 --> 56:44.150
Okay, come on.

56:45.277 --> 56:47.820
One thing about the guy who hit me...

56:48.322 --> 56:50.156
He had a square face.

56:51.617 --> 56:55.453
There wasn't much light here.
They try to save on electricity.

56:57.372 --> 56:58.581
Like this?

57:05.506 --> 57:07.006
No. Thinner.

57:10.385 --> 57:13.221
- That's it.
- Now it's coming back.

57:13.972 --> 57:16.224
Let's go to the guy in 634.

57:16.683 --> 57:19.018
- No luggage?
- That's right, sir.

57:19.353 --> 57:21.729
- And he didn't store anything?
- No, sir.

57:21.897 --> 57:24.857
He came in empty, which means
you gave him a good look-over.

57:25.025 --> 57:27.944
Always do.
They're the ones I give the eye to.

57:28.112 --> 57:29.695
Then you saw how he arrived?

57:29.863 --> 57:32.406
- Yes, sir. In a cab.
- What line?

57:32.825 --> 57:34.325
Sunshine Cab.

57:37.371 --> 57:41.457
- The guy who hit you, how old was he?
- About 50.

57:41.625 --> 57:42.917
What was his hair like?

57:43.085 --> 57:45.878
Gray. Getting bald. Bald on both sides.

57:46.463 --> 57:48.506
- That?
- No, balder.

57:49.216 --> 57:51.050
Am I helping you, sir?

57:51.218 --> 57:53.136
I never had it so good.

58:44.521 --> 58:46.397
His first stop was the Mark.

58:46.565 --> 58:48.608
- How long?
- Not long.

58:49.568 --> 58:51.611
Pull over there and wait.

59:39.076 --> 59:40.576
- Hello.
- Eddy?

59:41.245 --> 59:45.289
Dues time. I need some information
on a Johnny Ross. Chicago.

59:45.999 --> 59:48.668
Give me half an hour.
Meet you at Enrico's.

59:49.294 --> 59:50.503
Right.

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:02.890
- Two.
- Two what?

01:00:03.058 --> 01:00:05.977
Calls. He called twice.
The second was long distance.

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:08.688
How do you know it was long distance?

01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:11.232
He put in a lot of change.

01:00:40.012 --> 01:00:43.139
Good morning, Sam.
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:45.391
This is Mr. Chalmers.
My wife, Mrs. Bennet.

01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:48.561
- My son, Paul. My son, Tony.
- Tony, how are you?

01:00:48.729 --> 01:00:51.230
Would you mind
if I had a moment alone with Sam?

01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:53.024
No, of course not.

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:59.572
Must be difficult raising children
in the world of today.

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:02.408
I presume Tony is a college student.

01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:04.285
Yes, that's right.

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:07.455
I can well imagine the financial strain...

01:01:07.622 --> 01:01:10.541
...of sending a boy to university
on the salary of a captain.

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:13.044
There's no reason why
a man with your potential...

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:16.088
...shouldn't move right up,
given the right support.

01:01:17.049 --> 01:01:19.925
My family is waiting for me, Mr. Chalmers.

01:01:21.595 --> 01:01:23.929
Bullitt abducted my witness.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.599
He removed him from the hospital.

01:01:26.767 --> 01:01:30.561
As his superior officer, I've given him
complete charge of the case.

01:01:30.729 --> 01:01:33.105
If he's moving Ross around,
it's for a reason.

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:38.652
So you mean that you would not order
him to reveal where he's keeping Ross?

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.946
It's his case, Mr. Chalmers.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:47.578
Captain, I'm serving you
with a writ of habeas corpus...

01:01:48.413 --> 01:01:51.707
...making you responsible
for the delivery of Ross.

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:54.794
Duly observed...

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:56.629
...you have received it.

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:02.843
I need that witness
to prove his very existence.

01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:04.136
Now do you know...

01:02:04.805 --> 01:02:06.972
Excuse me, sir. Dad, Mom is waiting.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.600
Would you excuse us
for just another moment, Tony?

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:11.268
All right, son.

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:15.106
I do not choose to have
people accuse me of false promises...

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:17.274
...for the sake of cheap sensationalism...

01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:20.986
...or to be compromised
by your lieutenant. Or castrated.

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:47.304
Wait for me. I won't be long.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:44.111
According to my sources,
the Organization's Chicago branch...

01:03:44.279 --> 01:03:46.989
...caught Johnny Ross
with his hands in the till.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:48.699
They estimate he siphoned off...

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:52.036
...about $2 million
while operating their wire service.

01:03:52.204 --> 01:03:56.332
The story is they tried to get rid of him.
Friday night. Chicago.

01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:58.542
Chicago?

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:02.421
He got away unharmed.
They believe he's hiding here in town.

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:04.298
How old is this information, Eddy?

01:04:04.466 --> 01:04:08.052
Four hours. They're looking for him
all over town, Frank.

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:12.681
They've staked out the docks, the airport,
to keep him from leaving the country.

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:15.267
Anyone else trying for a hit?

01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:17.937
Haven't heard of any such likelihood.

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:19.980
What about his brother, Pete?

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:21.607
In the clear.

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:25.110
Okay, Eddy. Thanks.

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:28.489
- Anything I can do for you?
- There is something.

01:04:28.657 --> 01:04:31.951
Remember Zash-Zhoe?
They gave him three to five.

01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:35.287
- What is he in for?
- Receiving stolen property.

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:37.456
I'll try.

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:39.291
Thanks, Frank.

01:05:02.357 --> 01:05:05.442
- Here you go.
- Take care, lieutenant.

01:16:16.656 --> 01:16:18.698
What the hell is going on here?

01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:20.325
A high-speed pursuit.

01:16:20.493 --> 01:16:24.246
Two men are killed. An officer in the
hospital. A witness almost murdered.

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:27.332
I want to know what's happening now.
Let's hear it straight.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:28.917
Here's a report.

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:34.673
A man like Chalmers
could be a great help to the department.

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:37.968
He could speak for us where it counts.

01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:40.595
He could fight for us in the legislature.

01:16:41.055 --> 01:16:43.765
You have got to turn over his witness.

01:16:45.518 --> 01:16:46.893
Where's Ross?

01:16:49.647 --> 01:16:51.690
Tell him. That's an order.

01:16:55.736 --> 01:16:57.153
He's dead.

01:16:57.405 --> 01:16:59.614
- Dead?
- He died last night.

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:01.533
After you moved him?

01:17:01.701 --> 01:17:04.661
Before. I've got him downstairs
under a John Doe.

01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:09.082
You are sick.

01:17:10.376 --> 01:17:13.211
Smuggling a dead man out of a hospital.

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:17.716
And now two men killed,
who may have had nothing to do with it.

01:17:17.883 --> 01:17:20.302
The man I was chasing killed Ross.

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:22.220
How do you know? Did you see him?

01:17:22.513 --> 01:17:25.223
Yes. He tried to nail me with a shotgun.

01:17:25.433 --> 01:17:27.100
A Winchester pump.

01:17:30.396 --> 01:17:34.399
The radio report said the two men
were burned beyond recognition.

01:17:35.109 --> 01:17:39.446
Now all he's got are two dead men.
It would never hold up in court.

01:17:41.198 --> 01:17:44.034
I've got one lead. I want to move on it.

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:52.250
"Miss Dorothy Simmons.
Thunderbolt Hotel. San Mateo."

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:56.379
Ross called her person-to-person
from a phone in Union Square...

01:17:56.547 --> 01:17:59.090
...approximately nine hours
before he was killed.

01:17:59.258 --> 01:18:01.885
So he called his girlfriend.
What does that prove?

01:18:12.605 --> 01:18:17.150
This is Sunday. I'm going to hold that writ
until we come to work Monday morning.

01:18:36.253 --> 01:18:37.712
Go on. Get out.

01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:54.312
I need a car.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.023
Sorry, lieutenant, there's no cars left.

01:20:02.381 --> 01:20:05.341
- Ms. Simmons doesn't answer.
- What's her room number?

01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:08.094
I'm sorry, we're not allowed to give...

01:20:08.262 --> 01:20:11.389
Front. Take this gentleman
to Room 114, please.

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:48.319
Hello, Del?

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:54.158
It's a strangulation.

01:23:28.253 --> 01:23:30.088
I thought I knew you.

01:23:30.798 --> 01:23:32.882
But I'm not so sure anymore.

01:23:34.927 --> 01:23:38.721
Do you let anything reach you?
I mean, really reach you?

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:43.976
Or are you so used to it by now
that nothing really touches you?

01:23:44.144 --> 01:23:46.270
You're living in a sewer, Frank.

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:48.189
Day after day.

01:23:50.234 --> 01:23:53.861
That's where half of it is.
And you can't walk away from it.

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:57.949
I know it's there, but I don't have to
be reminded of the whole thing.

01:23:58.117 --> 01:24:00.076
The ugliness around us.

01:24:00.244 --> 01:24:04.956
With you, living with violence is a way
of life. Living with violence and death.

01:24:11.714 --> 01:24:15.842
How can you be part of it without
becoming more and more callous?

01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:23.474
Your world is so far from the one I know.

01:24:30.023 --> 01:24:32.316
What will happen to us in time?

01:24:36.989 --> 01:24:38.656
Time starts now.

01:24:50.377 --> 01:24:52.337
- What've you got?
- Let's start with the cleaver.

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:56.340
One cleaver,
approximately 8 inches in length.

01:24:57.217 --> 01:25:00.094
Ms. Simmons' luggage
has just arrived from the airport.

01:25:00.262 --> 01:25:02.638
Okay. Where is it?

01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:07.059
- Here you go.
- One pair of gold shoes...

01:25:07.227 --> 01:25:10.104
- Where is it from?
- San Mateo Thunderbolt Hotel.

01:25:10.272 --> 01:25:11.981
- And who from?
- Simmons.

01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:13.524
And what do we have?

01:25:13.692 --> 01:25:18.112
One yellow metal locket,
yellow metal watch, pearl necklace.

01:25:18.655 --> 01:25:20.990
- Put a hold on these.
- Yes, sir.

01:25:51.438 --> 01:25:53.189
We got a man here.

01:25:59.238 --> 01:26:01.823
Dearborn Travel Agency, Chicago. Rome.

01:26:03.408 --> 01:26:05.409
Look at all this literature.

01:26:06.119 --> 01:26:07.620
- Rome?
- Yeah.

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:14.418
What do you make out of that?
I thought she was alone.

01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:17.255
She's got a guy now.

01:26:24.221 --> 01:26:26.889
New purse, still got a price tag in it.

01:26:38.735 --> 01:26:40.570
Give me a bag, Tony.

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:55.334
Everything is new.
They weren't even away.

01:26:58.922 --> 01:27:01.799
Passport? No passport. No tickets.

01:27:01.967 --> 01:27:04.844
Yeah, I haven't found any tickets, either.

01:27:14.396 --> 01:27:15.605
Bingo.

01:27:17.524 --> 01:27:19.233
What've you got?

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:20.943
Great.

01:27:23.614 --> 01:27:25.698
"Albert E. Renick."

01:27:27.576 --> 01:27:29.744
Then who the hell is Simmons?

01:27:31.872 --> 01:27:35.041
Look how much money he's got.
Look at this.

01:27:40.964 --> 01:27:42.632
This guy is loaded.

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:46.928
- We've got a Renick.
- Wonder who Renick is.

01:27:50.015 --> 01:27:52.099
Look what I came up with.

01:27:54.645 --> 01:27:56.187
Dorothy Renick.

01:27:57.272 --> 01:27:58.981
Okay. Drop it in.

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:03.235
We're getting warm. "A.R."

01:28:03.904 --> 01:28:05.696
How does that grab you?

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:12.828
Give me a bag, Tony.
Fingerprints on this stuff.

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:19.919
Let's wrap her up.

01:28:30.347 --> 01:28:32.181
- Thanks, Tony.
- Okay.

01:28:33.642 --> 01:28:35.768
No ticket, no passport.

01:28:40.232 --> 01:28:43.943
Call Immigration in Chicago. Have them
wire Renick's passport applications.

01:28:44.111 --> 01:28:46.988
- I'll get a fingerprint check on Ross.
- Okay.

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:51.909
There are multiple gunshot wounds
on the left side of the face...

01:28:52.077 --> 01:28:55.371
...the left side of the neck,
and about the left upper thorax.

01:28:55.539 --> 01:28:58.624
These extend from the lateral extent
of the left eye...

01:28:58.792 --> 01:29:01.502
...and a portion of the left orbit
has been lacerated...

01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:04.922
...and aqueous humor
protrudes from the laceration.

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:08.175
There have been deep lacerations
in the immediate area...

01:29:08.343 --> 01:29:11.846
...and these have been approximated
by fine surgical sutures.

01:29:12.014 --> 01:29:15.433
There are multiple surgical incisions
about the left side of the face.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:18.352
There is considerable hemorrhage
in these deep tissues...

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:21.647
...and a number of surgical sutures
are present about this area.

01:29:21.982 --> 01:29:24.942
There are entrances into the sinuses...

01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:28.279
...and several pellets are found
located within this area.

01:29:28.447 --> 01:29:32.408
There are also multiple lacerations
and multiple gunshot entrance wounds...

01:29:32.576 --> 01:29:34.160
...about the left side of the neck.

01:29:34.327 --> 01:29:37.496
And similar wounds are found
on the left upper thorax.

01:29:37.664 --> 01:29:38.956
Period. The lacerations...

01:29:39.124 --> 01:29:42.043
Could you send up
those prints right away?

01:29:44.421 --> 01:29:49.300
There's a soft rubber catheter extending
out through the lateral extent of the...

01:29:59.936 --> 01:30:03.147
I understand Capt. Bennet told you,
you had until Monday morning...

01:30:03.315 --> 01:30:05.483
...to comply with my writ of habeas corpus.

01:30:05.650 --> 01:30:07.485
However, I want a signed admission now...

01:30:07.652 --> 01:30:10.529
...that Ross died
while he was in your custody.

01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:13.157
When I'm ready. Yes?

01:30:13.325 --> 01:30:16.994
- Your photographs are coming through.
- I'll be right up. Thank you.

01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:20.414
I demand that signed statement. Now.

01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:24.251
Excuse me.

01:30:49.736 --> 01:30:51.445
Is that the girl?

01:30:52.614 --> 01:30:53.864
Yeah.

01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:04.560
Ross.

01:32:04.728 --> 01:32:06.687
"Albert Edward Renick."

01:32:07.105 --> 01:32:09.273
"Used car salesman. Chicago."

01:32:10.942 --> 01:32:12.526
Who's Renick?

01:32:12.694 --> 01:32:15.029
He was the man who was shot
at the Hotel Daniels.

01:32:15.197 --> 01:32:18.282
You sent us to guard the wrong man,
Mr. Chalmers.

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.878
Mrs. Dorothy Renick and Mr. Al Renick...

01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:33.255
...have reservations
on the 7: 00 flight to Rome.

01:32:33.423 --> 01:32:35.216
Separate tickets. Not confirmed.

01:32:35.383 --> 01:32:37.176
And I got this report from Chicago.

01:32:37.344 --> 01:32:40.721
Renick has no record of arrests.
He's clean, Frank.

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:45.309
Well, Ross took close to $2 million
from the Organization.

01:32:45.477 --> 01:32:48.354
And he set Renick up
to get the heat off of him.

01:32:48.521 --> 01:32:51.565
Then he killed Renick's
wife to shut her up.

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:38.445
San Francisco Homicide.

01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:41.991
Do you have a Mr. Renick
on the 7: 00 flight for Rome?

01:33:42.158 --> 01:33:45.077
- He confirmed his flight a half hour ago.
- Did he check in yet?

01:33:45.245 --> 01:33:48.372
Not here, but he could do that at the gate.
Shall I call security?

01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:51.959
No, call the gate.
Have them recheck all the passports.

01:33:52.127 --> 01:33:54.211
- Which gate?
- Seventy-three.

01:34:03.221 --> 01:34:04.847
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

01:34:05.015 --> 01:34:08.058
Clipper Flight 110
is now ready for boarding.

01:34:08.643 --> 01:34:12.980
We hope you have a pleasant flight,
and thank you for choosing Pan American.

01:34:13.148 --> 01:34:15.607
No smoking, please, beyond this point.

01:34:15.775 --> 01:34:19.111
Would you please have your passports
available for inspection...

01:34:19.279 --> 01:34:21.405
...as you pass through the departure gate?

01:34:38.256 --> 01:34:39.590
Excuse me.

01:35:16.127 --> 01:35:17.461
Pardon me.

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.307
Step right here.

01:35:30.558 --> 01:35:34.728
And you're with the tour, too, are you?
There are other girls ahead of you.

01:35:34.896 --> 01:35:36.688
Step right on through.

01:36:27.282 --> 01:36:29.908
- Passenger Service.
- Can I help you, sir?

01:36:30.076 --> 01:36:34.455
Do you have a Renick, an Al E. Renick
on Flight 124 to London?

01:36:40.753 --> 01:36:41.920
What?

01:36:43.047 --> 01:36:47.301
Thank you. At the last minute,
on a Rome ticket. Flight Control.

01:37:26.758 --> 01:37:30.552
Ladies and gentlemen, we have just
been instructed to return to the gate.

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:32.679
For your safety, please remain seated...

01:37:32.847 --> 01:37:35.349
...until the aircraft
has come to a complete stop.

01:37:35.517 --> 01:37:37.851
We anticipate only a short delay.

01:37:38.019 --> 01:37:40.979
However, all passengers are requested
to disembark...

01:37:41.147 --> 01:37:44.191
...and remain in the departure lounge.
Thank you.

01:38:35.493 --> 01:38:37.411
He's still my witness.

01:38:37.829 --> 01:38:41.498
I'll be delighted to let you have him
after he testifies tomorrow.

01:38:58.016 --> 01:38:59.683
The Organization.

01:39:00.351 --> 01:39:02.185
Several murders.

01:39:02.687 --> 01:39:04.688
Could do us both a great deal of good.

01:39:04.856 --> 01:39:08.734
Look, Chalmers, let's understand
each other. I don't like you.

01:39:09.527 --> 01:39:12.404
Come on now, don't be naive, lieutenant.

01:39:12.614 --> 01:39:15.073
We both know how careers are made.

01:39:15.241 --> 01:39:17.534
Integrity is something you sell
to the public.

01:39:17.702 --> 01:39:21.371
You sell whatever you want,
but don't sell it here tonight.

01:39:22.707 --> 01:39:24.666
Frank, we must all compromise.

01:39:24.834 --> 01:39:26.376
Bullshit!

01:39:29.714 --> 01:39:31.965
Get the hell out of here, now.

01:41:04.142 --> 01:41:05.475
Thank you.

01:41:09.981 --> 01:41:13.316
- How long will we be delayed?
- Just about 45 minutes.

01:41:35.673 --> 01:41:37.174
Won't be long.

01:44:14.332 --> 01:44:15.874
Get me the security guard.

01:50:00.678 --> 01:50:02.011
Ticket, please.

01:50:25.327 --> 01:50:27.036
All right. Get back.

01:51:03.073 --> 01:51:05.742
Wonder who he was, what he did.

01:51:10.706 --> 01:51:12.749
I heard his shots all
the way down the hall.

01:51:12.916 --> 01:51:14.125
He's a cop, that's what he is.

01:51:14.293 --> 01:51:17.378
Let's get back. Let's keep the area clear.

01:51:18.589 --> 01:51:20.882
Come, ladies,
you don't want to see this now.

01:53:41.482 --> 01:53:43.483
