(SQUISHING)

03:01.949 --> 03:04.018
I'm embarrassed to call
this my home.

03:04.084 --> 03:08.122
You should be too.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.891
One day,
those people who feed you,

03:10.958 --> 03:13.594
they're gonna get tired of
coming home to this.

03:13.661 --> 03:16.930
And youse two are gonna
end up kissing the pavement.

03:16.997 --> 03:20.501
And I ain't gonna shed a tear,
'cause I warned ya.

03:20.568 --> 03:23.638
And get this in
your pointy little head, cat,

03:23.705 --> 03:27.207
as long as I'm here, you're
leaving the mouse alone.

04:07.949 --> 04:11.752
RICK: I'm just sayin',
the cat may have provoked
him a little.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.355
GINGER: Really?

04:14.422 --> 04:17.625
See? It's that kind of
aggression that leads
to this mess.

04:17.692 --> 04:20.361
And proves Spike can't be
trusted inside.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.696

04:34.908 --> 04:36.410
RICK: Okay, okay.

04:36.477 --> 04:39.046
What if I took him
to obedience school?

04:39.113 --> 04:41.015
Maybe he learns
to control himself,

04:41.081 --> 04:43.051
he could earn his way
back in the house.

04:43.118 --> 04:46.787
GINGER: I think that's
a great idea.
Dogs need boundaries.

You ain't gonna believe this.

Ahhh! What are you doing?

07:06.360 --> 07:09.196
Remember, Spike,
we sent you to
obedience school once.

07:09.263 --> 07:12.263
We can do it again.
