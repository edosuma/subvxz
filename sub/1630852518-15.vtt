00:20.145 --> 00:22.063


00:27.235 --> 00:30.488
-
-Ya gotta love Raptor Rapids,

00:30.572 --> 00:34.075
where you can ride a cool wet log
on a hot summer day.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.369
But where are the scary dinosaurs?

00:36.453 --> 00:38.830
-

00:38.913 --> 00:40.165
Pathetic.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.127
OK, that's just sad.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.296
Hippity-hippity hop!

00:46.379 --> 00:48.631
Don't forget to hit up the gift shop.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.259
Our dino deals are lit, yo.

00:51.342 --> 00:52.969
And not scary…

00:53.052 --> 00:54.554
Yay!

00:58.099 --> 01:01.102
Yo! That ride is lame.

01:01.186 --> 01:02.270
Uh…

01:02.353 --> 01:04.105
"We here at Triassic Town

01:04.189 --> 01:06.608
understand your dissatisfaction
with the ride

01:06.691 --> 01:08.693
and are working hard on ways
to enhance--"

01:08.777 --> 01:10.445
Just tell us what's fun here.

01:10.945 --> 01:12.864
The Dinosaur Dig is cool.

01:13.531 --> 01:17.452
You can find real bone fragments
from real dinosaur bones.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.996
-Did you say "bones?"

01:20.080 --> 01:21.915
And "dig?"

01:25.001 --> 01:27.295
Let's find some bones, boy!

01:30.215 --> 01:33.051
I got one! Kinda tiny, though.

01:33.134 --> 01:36.137
I got one, too, but mine's bigger.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.807
But mine is better.

01:38.890 --> 01:41.643
It probably belongs to a massive dinosaur

01:41.726 --> 01:45.063
that would kick
your tiny dino-bone's butt.

01:45.313 --> 01:46.689
That was rude.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.108
And there's only one way to settle this.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.235
To the lab!

01:51.361 --> 01:54.405
And they said we couldn't
artificially create DNA

01:54.489 --> 01:57.617
and evolve it millions of years
in seconds.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.410
Genius high-five!

01:59.494 --> 02:01.121
Stop every smart thing you're doing,

02:01.204 --> 02:04.541
and answer the most important
science question of all time.

02:04.624 --> 02:07.127
Whose bone would kick
the other bone's bone-butt

02:07.210 --> 02:10.255
if it were a real dinosaur
and not a tiny bone?

02:10.338 --> 02:12.465
Also, what's with the blob?

02:12.549 --> 02:15.301
-Oh, that's Blobby.
-Blobby!

02:15.385 --> 02:17.095
Cool…?

02:19.556 --> 02:24.018
Hmm… These bone fragments
seem to be from different species.

02:24.102 --> 02:27.689
And species we've never seen before.

02:27.772 --> 02:29.107
Uh-huh, great, which one's better?

02:29.190 --> 02:31.067
The only way to determine that

02:31.151 --> 02:35.071
is to simulate billions of years
of natural-selection cycles.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.448
Then I guess it's back to…

02:37.532 --> 02:39.742
-Tiny bone fight!
-Stop!

02:39.826 --> 02:43.580
Because we just invented
an evolution beam that can do it.

02:43.663 --> 02:49.127
And testing it on actual dino DNA
is way too good to pass up.

03:04.642 --> 03:07.353
-Huh?
-Cool!

03:07.437 --> 03:08.771
Ooh!

03:08.855 --> 03:10.690
OK, so which one's better?

03:10.773 --> 03:13.318
To accurately determine
superiority, Johnny,

03:13.401 --> 03:17.238
they need years of cognitive development
in their natural habitats.

03:17.322 --> 03:20.909
Right now, they lack
the basic instinct of what to eat.

03:21.701 --> 03:25.538
What about an extreme Backyard
Dino Obstacle Battle Challenge?

03:26.706 --> 03:28.333
That could work!

03:29.876 --> 03:32.003
The Johnnysaurus Rex is ready!

03:32.086 --> 03:34.422
The Duke-A-Don is readier!

03:34.505 --> 03:36.132
And friendly.

03:36.215 --> 03:38.551
OK, the rules are simple.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.012
You just run through the tunnel,
over the hurdles,

03:41.095 --> 03:42.764
climb the wall, and…

03:46.434 --> 03:48.436
First up is the speed test.

03:48.519 --> 03:52.941
-Whoever gets to the finish line first…
-Ah-wins-ah.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.656
Uh, how do you start a dino?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.704
Come on! You gotta go!

04:09.749 --> 04:12.961
We can't lose to the J-Rex!

04:13.044 --> 04:15.713
-Come on, J-Rex!

04:15.797 --> 04:18.258
Just get over the wall, and we win.

04:20.301 --> 04:22.971
Come on, boy, just grab the rope.
You can do it. Grab it!

04:23.054 --> 04:26.307
Wait. What's that thing
that horses hate again?

04:26.391 --> 04:28.393
Oh, yeah. Giddy-up!

04:31.187 --> 04:32.272
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

04:32.355 --> 04:34.315
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

04:36.401 --> 04:40.154
OK, forget the rope, just jump.
Jump it now!

04:40.238 --> 04:42.282
-We win!

04:43.866 --> 04:45.868
Now, how do you stop a dino?

04:46.619 --> 04:49.330
Next up, the Intelligence Test.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.582
Movies tell us
the mark of a superior dino

04:51.666 --> 04:54.794
is learning human behavior,
like opening a door.

04:54.877 --> 04:56.713
Blobby…

04:56.796 --> 04:58.464
Or using tools.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.383
Very good, Blobby.

05:00.466 --> 05:03.970
OK, Duke-A-Don, just do this.

05:09.684 --> 05:10.768
Yes!

05:10.852 --> 05:15.732
OK, now prepare to have
your mind blown by the J-Rex!

05:26.743 --> 05:28.911
It's his tiny arms again, isn't it?

05:28.995 --> 05:32.457
-Yup.
-Just bring on the next test.

05:33.666 --> 05:36.002
Time now for the High-Five Test.

05:36.085 --> 05:37.378
Wait, what?

05:37.462 --> 05:41.799
Physical interaction can also determine
a species' superiority.

05:41.883 --> 05:45.803
On it! Slap me five, dino of mine!

05:47.013 --> 05:48.514
Yes!

05:49.849 --> 05:51.517
Now it's your turn.

05:59.984 --> 06:01.069
Darn it!

06:01.152 --> 06:04.155
And the Duke-A-Don wins again!

06:09.035 --> 06:11.954
It's not necessarily
J-Rex's fault, Johnny.

06:12.121 --> 06:15.958
He's from the Triassic Period,
while D-Don is from the Cretaceous.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.001
Come again?

06:17.085 --> 06:21.214
That's over 90 million years of evolution
separating the two.

06:21.297 --> 06:25.301
J-Rex's tiny brain and tinier arms
just aren't as evolved.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.513
Really? Well, in that case…

06:29.305 --> 06:31.974
90 million years of evolving coming up!

06:32.058 --> 06:33.810
Johnny, no!

06:42.318 --> 06:45.947
We can't interrupt the sequence
once it's started!

06:46.030 --> 06:49.992
Well, if Johnny's dino
gets to evolve more, so does mine!

07:01.003 --> 07:01.963
Stop!

07:03.172 --> 07:05.925
You can't mess with evolution.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.052
It might lead to strange results.

07:09.428 --> 07:10.513
Blobby?

07:10.596 --> 07:12.932
Oh, you mean like J-Rex
having longer arms

07:13.015 --> 07:15.435
and a bigger brain than the dork-a-don?

07:15.518 --> 07:18.312
I'll see you at the starting line.

07:22.650 --> 07:25.820
Maybe creating an evolution beam
was a bad idea.

07:25.903 --> 07:28.364
It's possible.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.784
You heard the horn. Let's go!

07:31.868 --> 07:33.327
-Yeah, giddy-up!

07:36.205 --> 07:37.540
Whoa!

07:37.623 --> 07:39.125
Oof!

07:40.460 --> 07:41.627
Uh, Johnny?

07:41.711 --> 07:44.505
I think they want us to race and not them.

07:45.798 --> 07:48.259
Huh. Didn't see that coming.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.432
Check that.

07:54.515 --> 07:58.186
The evolution beam
was absolutely a bad idea.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.938
-Blobby…

08:01.481 --> 08:03.441
Wait, why is he flying away?

08:09.864 --> 08:12.325
You know what? Your dino wins.
It's awesome.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.284
Let's quit.

08:13.367 --> 08:14.368
Let's call it a tie,

08:14.452 --> 08:16.913
Cos the J-Rex
is looking so much stronger.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.333
And now he looks hungry.

08:20.416 --> 08:21.751
Let's go back the other way.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.547
Uh, what's going on?

08:26.923 --> 08:30.510
When you evolved your dinosaurs,
you also evolved their instincts!

08:30.593 --> 08:34.931
-Which is?
-To eat meaty moving things like us!

08:35.014 --> 08:36.933
But mine's a plant-eater.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.394
Not anymore!

08:41.270 --> 08:44.607
-Get to the lab and save yourselves!

08:44.690 --> 08:46.692
And come and get us, dinos!

08:49.445 --> 08:51.364
-Uh-oh.

08:55.826 --> 08:58.996
Yeah, this is not
how I saw myself going out.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.502
Oh, thanks, Blobby.

09:04.585 --> 09:06.212
Blobby!

09:09.215 --> 09:11.217
What if we turn them back into bones?

09:11.300 --> 09:14.929
Evolution only goes one way, Johnny:
forward.

09:15.012 --> 09:17.098
So we're gonna evolve them more.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.684
And make them unstoppably
smart and powerful

09:19.767 --> 09:22.103
so they eat us
then take over the world?

09:22.186 --> 09:25.231
Or they develop human-like
empathy and compassion

09:25.314 --> 09:27.108
and calm down.

09:31.153 --> 09:34.782
Now we just have to think of a way
to lure them onto the test pattern and--

09:34.865 --> 09:37.577
Yo, dinos!
You hungry for some of this?

09:37.660 --> 09:39.287
Or this?

09:39.370 --> 09:42.290
If I was a dino, I would totally eat that.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.419
Now!

09:51.716 --> 09:53.551
They're getting louder!

09:57.638 --> 09:58.848
Did it work?

09:59.557 --> 10:03.102
Oh, you're right.
Those roars were a tad loud.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.478
So sorry.

10:04.562 --> 10:09.609
We're clearly evolved 70 million years
and need to develop proper manners.

10:10.234 --> 10:12.111
Ooh… sophisticated.

10:12.194 --> 10:15.948
And we apologize
for messing with evolution.

10:16.032 --> 10:19.535
It's a little too complex
for us to handle.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.787
And that's why we must let Blobby go.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.665
Are you gonna be all right, little guy?

10:24.999 --> 10:27.877
Blobby-y-y-y!

10:29.086 --> 10:31.631
Well, that's a big yes.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.591
And what shall we do now?

10:33.674 --> 10:37.928
It feels like we're a little
too evolved to eat humans.

10:38.012 --> 10:41.724
But I must say, I still have the urge
to let out a good roar.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.977
A-ha, yes, that is jolly good fun.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.438
Ooh, I've got an idea.

10:50.232 --> 10:53.110
So nice to be back on Raptor Rapids!

10:53.194 --> 10:56.030
You mean the new and improved
Raptor Rapids?

10:56.822 --> 10:58.324
Wait for it…

11:00.701 --> 11:03.829
-Now, this is a dino ride!

11:04.372 --> 11:06.040
Thanks, Johnny!

11:06.123 --> 11:07.458
-Any time!

11:09.877 --> 11:12.380
Ooh, here comes the next log.

11:12.463 --> 11:13.506
Places!

11:14.632 --> 11:16.509
And…
