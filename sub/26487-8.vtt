How much do you spend
on advertising and

we were spending, like,

15:46.952 --> 15:48.854
something like $4,000 a week.
-A week? Wow.

15:48.854 --> 15:50.256
-A week.
-So, that's $48,000.

15:50.256 --> 15:51.657
Yeah,
so in the very beginning,

15:51.657 --> 15:53.289
our customer-acquisition
costs were higher.

15:53.289 --> 15:55.731
We were a no-name brand.
We were learning how to
optimize our funnel,

15:55.731 --> 15:58.034
and we were able to get
the customer-acquisition costs

15:58.034 --> 16:01.697
down from $100 down to $40.
-Okay.

16:01.697 --> 16:04.670
So, here's the killer question
that all investors have

16:04.670 --> 16:07.873
for this industry that changed
when Amazon bought Whole Foods

16:07.873 --> 16:11.247
and started acquiring
customers in Whole Foods.

16:11.247 --> 16:12.978
Then Albertsons bought Plated

16:12.978 --> 16:16.082
with 36 million customers
going into all the stores.

16:16.082 --> 16:18.554

their millions of customers

Plated, it's not the same model.

with Lunchables.

about this as an investor,

28:24.539 --> 28:27.983

-How much do they pay a month?
-They pay $9 a month.

-Our costs --
-That's a disaster.

39:13.658 --> 39:14.929
It keeps our costs down.

39:14.929 --> 39:17.131
Yeah, but you're in the mud.
You're in the weeds.

39:17.131 --> 39:20.695
The reason that we don't
co-pack, we wanted to keep
it raw and unpasteurized.

39:20.695 --> 39:23.298
I will tell you that
if I did not do a deal

39:23.298 --> 39:26.140
in my cocktail business,
I would have gotten swallowed.

39:26.140 --> 39:29.874
Everybody did copy me.
By now, everybody's copied me.
Right. Everyone knocked
you off.

39:29.874 --> 39:31.806
And I knew I needed
muscle and distribution.

39:31.806 --> 39:35.250
You need to come in
hot and hard and fast,

39:35.250 --> 39:37.352
and you need a partner 'cause
you're still in the kitchen.

39:37.352 --> 39:40.014
You're not even at phase
zero where you have someone
else doing it for you.

39:40.014 --> 39:42.186
So you need to get
the hell out of the kitchen,

39:42.186 --> 39:43.788
and you need
to start a business,

39:43.788 --> 39:47.762
not an artisanal mom-and-pop
beverage business. I'm out.

39:48.893 --> 39:50.495
You're not fully
cockroaches yet.

39:50.495 --> 39:52.867
You're sort of larvae.
You're just starting.

39:52.867 --> 39:54.429
And it's so early,

39:54.429 --> 39:55.930
and you haven't gone through
any of the pressures

39:55.930 --> 39:59.073
of marketing by the big guys
as they give you shelf space.

39:59.073 --> 40:00.705
The thing is,
is with little marketing,

40:00.705 --> 40:02.307
we have the points
of distribution.

40:02.307 --> 40:03.778
Every beverage guy
comes in here,

40:03.778 --> 40:06.040
and the future's so bright,
we got to wear shades.

40:06.040 --> 40:08.042
But you're still
vinegar roaches.

40:08.042 --> 40:09.514
The valuation's insane.

40:09.514 --> 40:11.516
I'm out.

40:11.516 --> 40:12.847
Cuban: Yeah, the problem
is there's no such thing

40:12.847 --> 40:13.918
as just a little marketing.

40:13.918 --> 40:15.820
The hard part
is the scaling part

40:15.820 --> 40:18.022
and taking people's
attention and sales

40:18.022 --> 40:19.424
away from other products.

40:19.424 --> 40:22.156
You're gonna have to raise
a lot more money after this,

40:22.156 --> 40:24.229
and that's the part
I'm concerned about.

40:24.229 --> 40:27.031
And so, as much as I would love
to help a Dallas company,

40:27.031 --> 40:28.503
I'm out.

40:28.503 --> 40:29.704
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

40:29.704 --> 40:32.367
I like it. It's great
that it's low calorie.

40:32.367 --> 40:35.270
Um, my only concern is
just struggling

40:35.270 --> 40:36.741
with the competitive edge.

40:36.741 --> 40:38.473
I see your vision,
but I don't think

40:38.473 --> 40:40.745
that you have gotten there yet.

40:40.745 --> 40:44.449
For me, I'll be a customer,
but I won't be a partner.

40:44.449 --> 40:46.451
I'm out.
-Thank you for that.

40:46.451 --> 40:47.752
Well, there's one shark left.

40:47.752 --> 40:48.953
Then there was one.

40:48.953 --> 40:50.985
-Yeah.
-And in the beverage business.

40:50.985 --> 40:52.186
Oza: But actually,
I'm not smart enough

40:52.186 --> 40:54.158
to have created
my own beverage ever.

40:54.158 --> 40:57.992
I find smart entrepreneurs,
um, and I partner with them.

40:57.992 --> 40:59.794
And they're the ones who have
the vision for the brand,

40:59.794 --> 41:02.166
but I've become the number-one
consigliere for them.

41:02.166 --> 41:05.300
So, I'm gonna give you an offer.

41:05.300 --> 41:06.301
-Whoa, kitty!
-Yes!

41:06.301 --> 41:08.142
Gonna give you an offer.

41:08.142 --> 41:10.244
But the valuation is not
what you're gonna want it to be.

41:13.648 --> 41:15.580
Beverage is savage.

41:15.580 --> 41:17.812
As Bethenny will tell you,
I'll tell you, it's savage.

41:17.812 --> 41:19.614
The mathematics
for a company that,

41:19.614 --> 41:21.886
this year,
has done $250,000,

41:21.886 --> 41:25.219
if we take it 12 months,
you're at...

41:25.219 --> 41:26.491
$360,000.

41:26.491 --> 41:29.294
Let's even round it up
to $400,000.

41:29.294 --> 41:32.297
That puts you at
a $1.6-odd million valuation.

41:32.297 --> 41:36.631
So, for $400,000,
for me to get interested,

41:36.631 --> 41:38.703
it's got to be more like...

41:38.703 --> 41:40.004
25%.

41:42.337 --> 41:45.239
Guys, that is a ridiculously
good offer for you.

41:45.239 --> 41:46.531
I would have never --
-Run.

41:46.531 --> 41:47.982
Run like a thief in the night.
-It is. It's very intriguing.

You -- You have to take that.
