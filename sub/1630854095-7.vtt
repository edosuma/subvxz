WEBVTT

00:03.570 --> 00:06.000
-Previously on SEAL Team...
-JASON: That's Yasiri.

00:06.000 --> 00:06.339
-Previously on SEAL Team...
-JASON: That's Yasiri.

00:06.406 --> 00:08.208
We'll pull up, throw Yasiri
in the truck, and we're gone.

00:08.274 --> 00:10.410
-Get us the fuck out of here.
-We're clean, let's do this!

00:10.477 --> 00:12.000
Why don't you say
what really went down out there?

00:12.000 --> 00:12.245
Why don't you say
what really went down out there?

00:12.312 --> 00:13.680
When it came time to execute,
you didn't think I could.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.382
CLAY:
I used to look at the future.

00:15.448 --> 00:16.750
Now I'm scared of what's around
the next corner.

00:16.816 --> 00:18.000
It was not the rifle
that made you shine.

00:18.000 --> 00:18.318
It was not the rifle
that made you shine.

00:18.385 --> 00:20.019
You are still that guy.

00:20.086 --> 00:21.788
Yasiri's militants are a proxy
for a state actor.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.390
-Who?
-I'm trying to figure that out.

00:23.456 --> 00:24.000
Instead of trying, start doing.

00:24.000 --> 00:24.758
Instead of trying, start doing.

00:24.824 --> 00:26.526
Says the guy who twice
had Yasiri

00:26.593 --> 00:28.395
in his crosshairs
and came home empty.

00:28.461 --> 00:30.000
Does the name Jacques Tandina
mean anything to you?

00:30.000 --> 00:30.530
Does the name Jacques Tandina
mean anything to you?

00:30.597 --> 00:33.299
He's the SGS source that
was playing both sides in Mali.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.235
The Agency is still using him.

00:35.301 --> 00:36.000
Yasiri's squirting.
We're losing him again.

00:36.000 --> 00:36.636
Yasiri's squirting.
We're losing him again.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.204
Hold tight, we're going
after the HVT.

00:38.271 --> 00:40.740
-[tires screeching]
-[gunfire]

00:41.741 --> 00:42.000
[barking]

00:42.000 --> 00:42.742
[barking]

00:42.809 --> 00:44.811
JASON:
Oh-ho, whoo! Hey!

00:44.878 --> 00:47.580
Probably thinks that we have
leftovers for him. [chuckles]

00:47.647 --> 00:48.000
[whistles, kisses]

00:48.000 --> 00:49.249
[whistles, kisses]

00:49.315 --> 00:52.352
I think we've tried
every mimosa in Vah Beach.

00:52.419 --> 00:53.553
What do you mean, "we"?

00:53.620 --> 00:54.000
I think it's finally happened.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.289
I think it's finally happened.

00:56.356 --> 00:57.791
I'm officially brunched out.

00:57.857 --> 01:00.000
All this downtime has turned me
into brunch guy.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.060
All this downtime has turned me
into brunch guy.

01:01.127 --> 01:02.462
-[exclaims]
-[laughing]

01:02.529 --> 01:04.397
It's like a gateway
to popping your collar

01:04.464 --> 01:05.665
and listening to yacht rock.

01:05.732 --> 01:06.000
Oh, casual boozy meals

01:06.000 --> 01:08.134
Oh, casual boozy meals

01:08.201 --> 01:10.136
are a perk of downtime,
if you ask me.

01:10.203 --> 01:11.504
Shame, though,
you're not gonna be getting

01:11.571 --> 01:12.000
any eggs Benedict
in Afghanistan.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.339
any eggs Benedict
in Afghanistan.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.575
Yeah, nor any Jason Hayes.

01:15.642 --> 01:17.577
At least you get to go back,

01:17.644 --> 01:18.000
you know,
finish what you started.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.513
you know,
finish what you started.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.582
Wish I could say the same
for Bravo.

01:24.217 --> 01:26.352
Well, while I'm helping
my friend's NGO

01:26.419 --> 01:30.000
get women to safety,
you can occupy yourself

01:30.000 --> 01:30.156
get women to safety,
you can occupy yourself

01:30.223 --> 01:32.792
as a sheepdog around here
till you get spun up again.

01:32.859 --> 01:34.427
Oh, okay.
[laughs]

01:34.494 --> 01:36.000
Have you talked to Clay
since he went home?

01:36.000 --> 01:36.129
Have you talked to Clay
since he went home?

01:36.196 --> 01:37.597
Ah, I want him to have
some time with his family,

01:37.664 --> 01:39.632
though living in
a one-bedroom apartment

01:39.699 --> 01:42.000
with a newborn, what he
really needs is space.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.570
with a newborn, what he
really needs is space.

01:43.636 --> 01:45.605
Are you sure you want
to be throwing stones

01:45.672 --> 01:47.607
from this particular
glass hovel?

01:47.674 --> 01:48.000
Oh, hovel?
Did you hear that?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.709
Oh, hovel?
Did you hear that?

01:49.776 --> 01:51.244
-[Cerberus barks]
-Hovel.

01:51.311 --> 01:53.279
This is no hovel.
This place is great.

01:54.214 --> 01:56.282
I'm not planning on living here
forever, that's for sure.

01:56.349 --> 01:57.817
Oh! Really?

01:57.884 --> 01:59.819
-Yeah.
-Where would you go?

01:59.886 --> 02:00.000
Always wanted to get
an Airstream.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.588
Always wanted to get
an Airstream.

02:01.654 --> 02:03.223
[both laughing]

02:03.289 --> 02:06.000
And live by the water.
Why is that so funny?

02:06.000 --> 02:06.559
And live by the water.
Why is that so funny?

02:06.626 --> 02:08.561
I wouldn't expect
any less from Bravo 1.

02:08.628 --> 02:11.498
You like being able to drop
everything in 30 seconds

02:11.564 --> 02:12.000
and run into the fire
with Bravo.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.266
and run into the fire
with Bravo.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.368
-Hmm.
-No judgment.

02:15.435 --> 02:16.703
There you go.

02:18.972 --> 02:22.242
To be honest,
I'd be more concerned

02:22.308 --> 02:24.000
if you told me you had a house
in Key West

02:24.000 --> 02:24.811
if you told me you had a house
in Key West

02:24.878 --> 02:26.846
you had your eye on,

02:26.913 --> 02:29.148
where you could spend
your days fishing.

02:29.215 --> 02:30.000
Fishing.
Caught.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.284
Fishing.
Caught.

02:31.351 --> 02:33.286
[laughs]

02:33.353 --> 02:36.000
To us, two sharks
always circling.

02:36.000 --> 02:36.756
To us, two sharks
always circling.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.000
[clears throat]

02:48.000 --> 02:48.167
[clears throat]

02:55.308 --> 02:57.343
Yo, hey, you don't need
to be doing that.

02:57.410 --> 02:58.444
What?

02:58.511 --> 03:00.000
You don't need
to be doing that.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.346
You don't need
to be doing that.

03:00.413 --> 03:02.415
Oh, come on,
you've made breakfast every day

03:02.482 --> 03:05.652
since you've come home.
I can clean up.

03:05.718 --> 03:06.000
I-I'm pretty sure there's
not enough household chores

03:06.000 --> 03:08.187
I-I'm pretty sure there's
not enough household chores

03:08.254 --> 03:10.557
to make up for walking out
on you and Brian.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.661
Well, a week's worth
of you making omelets

03:14.727 --> 03:16.896
-is a good start.
-[Brian fussing]

03:16.963 --> 03:18.000
But you could, you know,
afford to change up,

03:18.000 --> 03:19.933
But you could, you know,
afford to change up,

03:19.999 --> 03:22.702
maybe throw in
a German pancake or something.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.000
-Noted.
-Mm, good.

03:24.000 --> 03:24.938
-Noted.
-Mm, good.

03:25.004 --> 03:27.206
However, Professor,
you know,

03:27.273 --> 03:29.375
omelets are actually a metaphor.

03:29.442 --> 03:30.000
Like breaking eggs,
making a mess.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.611
Like breaking eggs,
making a mess.

03:31.678 --> 03:33.746
And yet still providing
for your family.

03:33.813 --> 03:34.881
-I get it.
-Right.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.000
Seriously, though, you...
stop apologizing.

03:42.000 --> 03:42.488
Seriously, though, you...
stop apologizing.

03:42.555 --> 03:45.959
We both made mistakes
navigating your recovery.

03:47.594 --> 03:48.000
[exhales sharply]

03:48.000 --> 03:48.895
[exhales sharply]

03:48.962 --> 03:51.731
Yeah, well, I'm not sure
that you being cautious

03:51.798 --> 03:54.000
compares to me insisting
that everything is normal

03:54.000 --> 03:54.434
compares to me insisting
that everything is normal

03:54.500 --> 03:55.969
and then losing my shit

03:56.035 --> 03:57.670
when I finally realized
that it wasn't.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.000
You're here now.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.673
You're here now.

04:02.375 --> 04:05.011
And between my sabbatical

04:05.078 --> 04:06.000
and you taking a break
from Green Team...

04:06.000 --> 04:08.348
and you taking a break
from Green Team...

04:09.682 --> 04:10.984
I think we can slow down,

04:11.050 --> 04:12.000
maybe figure out
what normal means.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.687
maybe figure out
what normal means.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.762
How's your pain level?

04:27.433 --> 04:30.000
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't jonesing for a pill.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.637
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't jonesing for a pill.

04:33.539 --> 04:36.000
The doctor said that cravings
should lessen after ten days.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.543
The doctor said that cravings
should lessen after ten days.

04:38.378 --> 04:40.380
And you're almost
out of the woods.

04:41.381 --> 04:42.000
[sighs]

04:42.000 --> 04:42.649
[sighs]

04:43.650 --> 04:46.552
I promise, I'm never wandering
into those woods again.

04:49.455 --> 04:50.890
-Mm.
-Come here.

05:00.933 --> 05:02.435
[knocking]

05:03.269 --> 05:06.000
Oh, look at you, all busy
behind your big-girl desk.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.006
Oh, look at you, all busy
behind your big-girl desk.

05:07.073 --> 05:09.676
Well, I'm trying to clean out
my inbox

05:09.742 --> 05:12.000
before I head up to D.C.

05:12.000 --> 05:12.345
before I head up to D.C.

05:12.412 --> 05:14.814
Looks like I'm also gonna have
to clean up that puddle of sweat

05:14.881 --> 05:16.649
you're dripping
on my floor there, Sonny.

05:16.716 --> 05:18.000
Oh, yeah, just been doing
three-day workouts at the gym.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.519
Oh, yeah, just been doing
three-day workouts at the gym.

05:19.585 --> 05:21.421
Yeah, I don't really have
anything much else

05:21.487 --> 05:23.089
to do, since...

05:23.156 --> 05:24.000
You know,
I'm happy Clay's doing Clay,

05:24.000 --> 05:24.691
You know,
I'm happy Clay's doing Clay,

05:24.757 --> 05:27.694
but I'm really gonna miss
putting on...

05:27.760 --> 05:29.562
[with accent]:
...that Mrs. Doubtfire brassiere

05:29.629 --> 05:30.000
and helping out
with little Brian.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.864
and helping out
with little Brian.

05:31.931 --> 05:34.467
Now, had I known me
sweating profusely would, uh...

05:34.534 --> 05:36.000
-Shut up, listen.
-Oh.

05:36.000 --> 05:36.035
-Shut up, listen.
-Oh.

05:36.102 --> 05:39.439
I just got an email
from a contact at the CIA

05:39.505 --> 05:41.874
confirming that they still rely
on the SGS source

05:41.941 --> 05:42.000
they used in our
target package in Mali.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.077
they used in our
target package in Mali.

05:44.143 --> 05:47.613
The source that sold us out,
that got us ambushed,

05:47.680 --> 05:48.000
that lost Clay's leg?

05:48.000 --> 05:48.915
that lost Clay's leg?

05:48.981 --> 05:51.084
The fucker that I've been
dreaming about

05:51.150 --> 05:53.519
putting six feet under?

05:53.586 --> 05:54.000
That's the thing.

05:54.000 --> 05:54.787
That's the thing.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.723
They swear that he didn't
double-cross us.

05:56.789 --> 05:58.658
Oh, bullshit,
that's just the Agency

05:58.725 --> 06:00.000
-covering their ass.
-I don't think so.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.794
-covering their ass.
-I don't think so.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.796
The official AAR came down
and said the source

06:03.863 --> 06:04.964
had been taken out of play.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.000
Something doesn't smell right.

06:06.000 --> 06:06.899
Something doesn't smell right.

06:06.966 --> 06:09.469
So, I put in an RFI
for the case file

06:09.535 --> 06:11.370
for the operation.

06:11.437 --> 06:12.000
Once the red tape clears,
I'll know.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.006
Once the red tape clears,
I'll know.

06:14.073 --> 06:16.843
If the source was good,
then who fucked over Clay?

06:16.909 --> 06:18.000
I'll try to find out,
put it on my list

06:18.000 --> 06:19.078
I'll try to find out,
put it on my list

06:19.145 --> 06:21.948
along with getting Bravo
back to Syria.

06:22.014 --> 06:23.683
If the war machine's
gonna try and pull

06:23.750 --> 06:24.000
some sort of Pat Tillman-style
cover-up,

06:24.000 --> 06:25.618
some sort of Pat Tillman-style
cover-up,

06:25.685 --> 06:27.754
I tell you what, man,
someone's gonna pay for this.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.000
I can't do anything
until I get that case file.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.723
I can't do anything
until I get that case file.

06:30.790 --> 06:33.659
And even then, once I do know
the questions to ask,

06:33.726 --> 06:36.000
the answers that we'll want
lie above my pay grade.

06:36.000 --> 06:36.462
the answers that we'll want
lie above my pay grade.

06:36.529 --> 06:38.131
Davis, you need to think.

06:38.197 --> 06:40.533
Okay, what about them fancy
committees of yours?

06:40.600 --> 06:41.934
You know, a new
cake-eater friend

06:42.001 --> 06:43.469
that might want to hook you up?

06:46.906 --> 06:48.000
I mean, I'm trying to understand
how it works.

06:48.000 --> 06:48.708
I mean, I'm trying to understand
how it works.

06:48.775 --> 06:50.076
-I mean, it looks real good.
-[knocking]

06:50.143 --> 06:51.577
-Hi!
-Oh, Mr. Hobart, welcome.

06:51.644 --> 06:53.846
I wanted to say thank you
to you two.

06:53.913 --> 06:54.000
NAIMA:
Oh.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.648
NAIMA:
Oh.

06:55.715 --> 06:57.583
Thank you for what
you're doing here.

06:57.650 --> 06:58.718
Oh...

06:58.785 --> 07:00.000
Well, thank you
for your service.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.853
Well, thank you
for your service.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.588
[chuckles]

07:02.655 --> 07:05.625
Uh, our assistant Kayla
will show you

07:05.691 --> 07:06.000
back to a nurse
for an assessment.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.193
back to a nurse
for an assessment.

07:09.996 --> 07:12.000
That's a pretty good sign
we're filling a gap

07:12.000 --> 07:12.598
That's a pretty good sign
we're filling a gap

07:12.665 --> 07:14.667
that desperately needed it.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.602

14:32.438 --> 14:33.973
who could have used
a place like this.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.000
Yeah, thanks.

14:36.000 --> 14:36.542
Yeah, thanks.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.277
I can't take all the credit.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.279
Ray definitely had a vision.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.000
Well, found himself
another way to serve.

14:42.000 --> 14:42.081
Well, found himself
another way to serve.

14:42.147 --> 14:43.515
Yeah.

14:43.582 --> 14:45.484
MAN: I told you,
I already filled those out!

14:47.486 --> 14:48.000
-Okay?
-CLAY: Hey.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.255
-Okay?
-CLAY: Hey.

14:49.321 --> 14:52.258
-Listen!
-Hey! Hey, relax, okay?

14:52.324 --> 14:53.259
Hey, wait just a...

14:53.325 --> 14:54.000
-[shouting]
-Hey.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.427
-[shouting]
-Hey.

14:55.494 --> 14:56.595
Easy, all right?
Relax.

14:56.662 --> 14:57.630
-Come on.
-Hey.

14:57.696 --> 14:58.631
-Let me go!
-Relax.

14:58.697 --> 15:00.000
Let go of me.

15:00.000 --> 15:00.332
Let go of me.

15:02.968 --> 15:04.203
[whistles, kisses]

15:04.270 --> 15:06.000
-In you go, bud. That's it.
-[barks]

15:06.000 --> 15:06.472
-In you go, bud. That's it.
-[barks]

15:06.538 --> 15:09.308
So, we're both leaving
for unfinished business.

15:10.342 --> 15:12.000
Only one who loses is Cerby.

15:12.000 --> 15:12.044
Only one who loses is Cerby.

15:12.111 --> 15:14.513
Cerby, he's definitely
not losing out, I'll tell you.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.116
Theo cooks him a steak
practically every night.

15:17.182 --> 15:18.000
-What?
-He's, he's getting

15:18.000 --> 15:18.317
-What?
-He's, he's getting

15:18.384 --> 15:19.418
the better of the half.

15:19.485 --> 15:21.520
[scoffs]
Then we all win.

15:22.454 --> 15:24.000
I don't know.
You working on Taliban's turf,

15:24.000 --> 15:24.990
I don't know.
You working on Taliban's turf,

15:25.057 --> 15:27.126
I don't really know
if that's a win,

15:27.192 --> 15:30.000
especially if you don't have
Jason Hayes to protect you.

15:30.000 --> 15:30.095
especially if you don't have
Jason Hayes to protect you.

15:30.162 --> 15:31.563
You saying
you don't want me to go?

15:32.564 --> 15:34.300
Can't ask that.

15:34.366 --> 15:36.000
I hope we're at a place
where you can ask me anything.

15:36.000 --> 15:36.502
I hope we're at a place
where you can ask me anything.

15:38.304 --> 15:40.039
Anything but that.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.640
If you asked me to stand down,
I'd say no.

15:41.707 --> 15:42.000
I'd never ask that.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.375
I'd never ask that.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.678
[Jason exhales sharply]

15:45.744 --> 15:47.313
What's got you spinning?

15:47.379 --> 15:48.000
I thought you'd be thrilled
to get a shot

15:48.000 --> 15:48.947
I thought you'd be thrilled
to get a shot

15:49.014 --> 15:50.282
at your unfinished business
in Syria.

15:50.349 --> 15:52.584
Oh, I am, trust me.

15:52.651 --> 15:54.000
I am, I am.
But maybe that's the problem.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.621
I am, I am.
But maybe that's the problem.

15:55.688 --> 15:59.124
Meanwhile, Ray and Clay

15:59.191 --> 16:00.000
have found their off-ramps
from operating.

16:00.000 --> 16:00.459
have found their off-ramps
from operating.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.594
-You think they shouldn't?
-Not at all.

16:02.661 --> 16:04.563
Just seeing them,
you know, move on

16:04.630 --> 16:06.000
has got me thinking
about our future,

16:06.000 --> 16:06.398
has got me thinking
about our future,

16:06.465 --> 16:09.568
and I don't see any off-ramps,
all I see is Bravo.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.000
I mean, what does that
say about me, right?

16:12.000 --> 16:13.038
I mean, what does that
say about me, right?

16:13.105 --> 16:15.574
Despite all the work
that I've done on myself,

16:15.641 --> 16:17.076
I cannot quit this war.

16:17.943 --> 16:18.000
It says you know
there's still a lot of work

16:18.000 --> 16:20.512
It says you know
there's still a lot of work

16:20.579 --> 16:22.314
left to do-- we both do.

16:22.381 --> 16:24.000
When we drop everything
to do that work,

16:24.000 --> 16:25.150
When we drop everything
to do that work,

16:25.217 --> 16:26.485
there's a price.

16:28.253 --> 16:30.000
That price is
the collateral damage

16:30.000 --> 16:30.022
That price is
the collateral damage

16:30.089 --> 16:31.557
on the folks we care about.

16:34.226 --> 16:36.000
Look, I-I've heard
some alarm bells, too.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.329
Look, I-I've heard
some alarm bells, too.

16:37.396 --> 16:41.200
It's hard not to when history
has proven

16:41.266 --> 16:42.000
that running into the fire
turns our relationships

16:42.000 --> 16:44.069
that running into the fire
turns our relationships

16:44.136 --> 16:45.637
into casualties.

16:45.704 --> 16:47.773
But we're both running in.

16:49.108 --> 16:50.709
That makes us different, right?

16:52.478 --> 16:54.000
[phone buzzing]

16:54.000 --> 16:54.613
[phone buzzing]

16:56.615 --> 16:58.450
Oh, that's my Uber.

17:01.787 --> 17:04.356
[Cerberus whines]

17:06.725 --> 17:09.261
I'll see you, uh...
see you when I get home.

17:09.328 --> 17:10.396
Yeah. All good.

17:12.097 --> 17:13.766
-Get home safe.
-You, too.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.706
[sighs]

17:42.761 --> 17:45.431
A little dustier
than we left it.

17:45.497 --> 17:48.000
Yeah. Well, the way
we scrambled out of here,

17:48.000 --> 17:48.233
Yeah. Well, the way
we scrambled out of here,

17:48.300 --> 17:50.736
asses in hand, probably forgot
to tip the maid.

17:52.204 --> 17:53.605
Ray, still nothing
from the Agency

17:53.672 --> 17:54.000
on those potential ISIS targets?

17:54.000 --> 17:55.407
on those potential ISIS targets?

17:55.474 --> 17:58.177
They said they're still
synthesizing the latest intel.

17:59.044 --> 18:00.000
All right, well, we don't hear
anything by tomorrow morning,

18:00.000 --> 18:02.181
All right, well, we don't hear
anything by tomorrow morning,

18:02.247 --> 18:04.583
I got somewhere else
we can go to for help.

18:04.650 --> 18:05.818
Roger that.

18:31.243 --> 18:33.645
-[speaks Kurdish]
-SONNY: Yezda.

18:33.712 --> 18:36.000
I see that trash-talking seminar
served you well.

18:36.000 --> 18:36.348
I see that trash-talking seminar
served you well.

18:36.415 --> 18:38.383
Bravo Team.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.819
What misfortune have you
returned to inflict upon us?

18:40.886 --> 18:42.000
Yezda, it tore us up,
having to leave the way we did.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.690
Yezda, it tore us up,
having to leave the way we did.

18:44.756 --> 18:47.259
Looks like you stepped up
into the commander's boots.

18:47.326 --> 18:48.000
With an assist from Bravo Team.
Why are you here?

18:48.000 --> 18:49.761
With an assist from Bravo Team.
Why are you here?

18:49.828 --> 18:51.663
We came back to take out Yasiri.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.665
Weeks after his men
killed our commander,

18:53.732 --> 18:54.000
after they attacked us again
and killed four of my sisters?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.901
after they attacked us again
and killed four of my sisters?

18:55.968 --> 18:58.570
We can give you retribution
for Commander Nouri.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.000
I know I want some.

19:00.000 --> 19:00.172
I know I want some.

19:00.239 --> 19:02.140
So, go get it.

19:02.207 --> 19:03.842
We hoped you might
help us with that.

19:03.909 --> 19:05.210
You don't think
we've given enough?

19:06.645 --> 19:08.180
We're just looking
for some info, okay?

19:08.247 --> 19:09.681
You know,
tune you might've heard

19:09.748 --> 19:12.000
listening to the ISIS radio
the way you do.

19:12.000 --> 19:12.317
listening to the ISIS radio
the way you do.

19:13.418 --> 19:16.722
Word is, some of the ISIS
whose compound was destroyed

19:16.788 --> 19:18.000
might know the location
of Yasiri.

19:18.000 --> 19:18.924
might know the location
of Yasiri.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.592
We were hoping you could
point us in the direction

19:20.659 --> 19:23.595
-of those ISIS.
-What do we get in return?

19:23.662 --> 19:24.000
Empty apologies
and promises

19:24.000 --> 19:25.397
Empty apologies
and promises

19:25.464 --> 19:27.466
won't buy us weapons
to protect ourselves.

19:27.533 --> 19:29.434
American money will.

19:29.501 --> 19:30.000
Commander Nouri spoke of how
you threw it around in the past.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.471
Commander Nouri spoke of how
you threw it around in the past.

19:33.672 --> 19:34.907
$50,000.

19:34.973 --> 19:36.000

Done.

19:36.000 --> 19:36.308
JASON:
Done.

19:40.512 --> 19:41.813
Done.

19:43.882 --> 19:45.484
I hear the commander

19:45.551 --> 19:47.553
at that ISIS compound
is said to be alive.

19:47.619 --> 19:48.000
If anyone knows
Yasiri's location, it is him.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.622
If anyone knows
Yasiri's location, it is him.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.924
Where is this
commander located?

19:51.990 --> 19:53.292
In the wind.

19:54.826 --> 19:56.595
But I hear his wife,

19:56.662 --> 19:58.330
she is powerful
in her own right.

19:58.397 --> 20:00.000
You want to make a deal
with the devil,

20:00.000 --> 20:00.332
You want to make a deal
with the devil,

20:00.399 --> 20:01.700
I can tell you
where to find her.

20:01.767 --> 20:03.368
We're listening.

20:03.435 --> 20:05.504
It's called Al-Hawl.

20:05.571 --> 20:06.000
And before you even think
of asking,

20:06.000 --> 20:06.872
And before you even think
of asking,

20:06.939 --> 20:08.340
there isn't enough cash
in the world

20:08.407 --> 20:10.475
to get me to go
in there with you.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.948
[screaming]

20:26.358 --> 20:28.727
Al-Hawl refugee camp,
60 klicks from here.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.965
At the fall of
the ISIS caliphate in Syria,

20:33.031 --> 20:36.000
the camp was created to house
the left-behind wives,

20:36.000 --> 20:36.335
the camp was created to house
the left-behind wives,

20:36.401 --> 20:38.503
widows, and children,
many of whom are orphans.

20:38.570 --> 20:41.306
Doesn't look like the sun will
come out tomorrow over there.

20:41.373 --> 20:42.000
ISIS brides biding their time
until the caliphate rises again.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.576
ISIS brides biding their time
until the caliphate rises again.

20:44.643 --> 20:45.877
Who's watching over this place?

20:45.944 --> 20:48.000
The U.N. withdrew
along with the Red Cross

20:48.000 --> 20:48.580
The U.N. withdrew
along with the Red Cross

20:48.647 --> 20:50.682
and other NGOs.

20:50.749 --> 20:54.000
Officially, Kurdish YPG
are serving as the wardens.

20:54.000 --> 20:54.853
Officially, Kurdish YPG
are serving as the wardens.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.290
But after having a dozen men
stabbed and ripped apart inside,

20:58.357 --> 20:59.625
they stick to the perimeter.

20:59.691 --> 21:00.000
The camp is run
by the women inside.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.894
The camp is run
by the women inside.

21:02.961 --> 21:06.000
And we're gonna go in and ask
one of them for a favor.

21:06.000 --> 21:06.398
And we're gonna go in and ask
one of them for a favor.

21:08.467 --> 21:09.601
Yeah.

21:09.668 --> 21:12.000
-[chuckles]
-Yeah.

21:12.000 --> 21:12.037
-[chuckles]
-Yeah.

21:24.349 --> 21:25.884
Shit, man.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.453
I'm not up for round two
if you've come back for more.

21:29.621 --> 21:30.000
Man, I-I'm sorry
about the wrists.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.289
Man, I-I'm sorry
about the wrists.

21:32.457 --> 21:33.825
I'm Clay.

21:33.892 --> 21:35.927
Ben.
You know, if I had known

21:35.994 --> 21:36.000
that there was a team guy here,

21:36.000 --> 21:37.396
that there was a team guy here,

21:37.462 --> 21:39.498
I would've kept myself
in check.

21:40.465 --> 21:41.733
What gave it away?

21:41.800 --> 21:42.000
Don't you know
how to spot a team guy?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.702
Don't you know
how to spot a team guy?

21:44.870 --> 21:46.004
He'll tell you.

21:47.673 --> 21:48.000
Fair enough.

21:48.000 --> 21:48.640
Fair enough.

21:48.707 --> 21:51.009
What about you?

21:52.411 --> 21:53.745
Air Force.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.582
Well, appreciate you,
uh, stepping in

21:57.649 --> 22:00.000
when I... I bugged out.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.319
when I... I bugged out.

22:01.386 --> 22:03.455
Kept me from another night
in lockup.

22:04.790 --> 22:06.000
What set you off?

22:06.000 --> 22:06.358
What set you off?

22:07.726 --> 22:09.628
[sighs]
It's all those questions

22:09.695 --> 22:10.996
at intake, man.

22:12.464 --> 22:14.399
It's hard enough
asking for help, you know?

22:14.466 --> 22:16.902
Why I got to open up a vein
and talk about homelessness

22:16.968 --> 22:18.000
and PTS and shit?

22:18.000 --> 22:18.704
and PTS and shit?

22:21.840 --> 22:24.000
Maybe that's how they find out
what you need help with.

22:24.000 --> 22:24.342
Maybe that's how they find out
what you need help with.

22:24.409 --> 22:26.411
[scoffs]
No, what I need

22:26.478 --> 22:28.113
is one night of sleep
without a nightmare.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.000
One morning where I wake up,
feel like myself again.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.484
One morning where I wake up,
feel like myself again.

22:35.687 --> 22:36.000
Too many guys get home
from the battlefield

22:36.000 --> 22:37.522
Too many guys get home
from the battlefield

22:37.589 --> 22:39.558
believing they'll never,
ever shake the things

22:39.624 --> 22:40.892
they've seen and done.

22:44.629 --> 22:46.698
I didn't ever come home
from the battlefield.

22:47.899 --> 22:48.000
Like, literally.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.434
Like, literally.

22:51.069 --> 22:54.000
Joined up to fly fighter jets,

22:54.000 --> 22:54.106
Joined up to fly fighter jets,

22:54.172 --> 22:57.743
and instead they got me
up in Langley killing people

22:57.809 --> 23:00.000
tens of thousands of miles away
with a joystick.

23:00.000 --> 23:00.412
tens of thousands of miles away

Jacket says he's native Syrian,
he spoke Arabic.

46:01.391 --> 46:04.461
Ma'am, I don't believe
he received that AAR.

46:04.528 --> 46:06.000
Metadata shows he generated it
and sent it off.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.331
Metadata shows he generated it
and sent it off.

46:07.397 --> 46:09.466
Who the hell's
up the chain from Yasiri?

46:10.534 --> 46:12.000
Who was he submitting it to?

46:12.000 --> 46:12.402
Who was he submitting it to?

46:12.469 --> 46:15.873
Haven't yet determined who.
Only where.

46:22.579 --> 46:24.000
[phone ringing]

46:24.000 --> 46:25.215
[phone ringing]

46:30.087 --> 46:32.422
-Perry.
-DAVIS: Ray, I need to confirm

46:32.489 --> 46:34.892
that the HVT's laptop
has remained secure

46:34.958 --> 46:36.000
in a Faraday case.

46:36.000 --> 46:36.326
in a Faraday case.

46:38.128 --> 46:41.198
Affirm, why?
What's going on?

46:41.265 --> 46:42.000
Bravo needs to take
every measure

46:42.000 --> 46:42.933
Bravo needs to take
every measure

46:43.000 --> 46:44.902
to stay blacked out
until I can ensure

46:44.968 --> 46:46.236
you haven't been compromised.

46:46.303 --> 46:47.871
Why the extra
cloak and dagger now?

46:47.938 --> 46:48.000
I mean, Yasiri's out
of the picture,

46:48.000 --> 46:49.173
I mean, Yasiri's out
of the picture,

46:49.239 --> 46:51.175
and we're not on
his militia's radar.

46:51.241 --> 46:54.000
The militia's not our concern.
The force behind them is.

46:54.000 --> 46:54.578
The militia's not our concern.
The force behind them is.

46:54.645 --> 46:56.480
Wait.

46:56.547 --> 46:58.849
You figured out where
the weapons came from?

46:58.916 --> 47:00.000
Their weapons,
their funding,

47:00.000 --> 47:00.150
Their weapons,
their funding,

47:00.217 --> 47:02.119
their marching orders.

47:02.186 --> 47:04.521
It's all coming
from the same place.

47:04.588 --> 47:05.989
Iran.

47:06.056 --> 47:07.057
That's who we've been battling.
