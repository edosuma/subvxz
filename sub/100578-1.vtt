WEBVTT

00:51.468 --> 00:53.129
They're coming.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.620
- Good to see you, jj.
- Likewise, general.

01:22.791 --> 01:25.373
- Welcome to Russia.
- Right, let's get on with it.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.879
General: Hollow plutonium pit.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.139
9.7 kilograms,
with tritium boost.

01:41.310 --> 01:45.019
A yield of 800 kilotons
is possible.

01:45.188 --> 01:47.019
Take your time, gentlemen.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.647
We want everyone to be happy.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.904
So, you have a builder
for your weapon yet?

01:55.073 --> 01:56.904
What?

01:57.951 --> 01:59.657
Builder for your weapon.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.659
What do you care?

02:02.789 --> 02:05.155
Obtaining plutonium, step one.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.325
But the build is most critical.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.993
That's it. I know people.
Simple question.

02:10.172 --> 02:11.878
No, it is not simple.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.290
You asked me who my builder is.
“Whoa! Whoa!

02:14.468 --> 02:16.749
- General: Is there a problem?
- Yeah, there is a problem.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.509
I think this guy's
a government agent.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.092
Who are you? Interpol?

02:21.266 --> 02:23.973
Mib? CIA?

02:24.144 --> 02:26.305
Don't be crazy.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.892
I'm just a guy

02:29.066 --> 02:32.650
standing in front
of another guy,

02:32.819 --> 02:34.605
asking him not to shoot him.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.896
- Oh, Christ. "Notting hill".
- He's screwed.

02:37.074 --> 02:39.235
- No, no. He's got this.
- What are we gonna do?

02:39.409 --> 02:41.491
Nothing. He's too far out.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.368
He knew this was a solo run.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.244
What do you think you know

02:45.415 --> 02:47.155
that you're pointing weapons
at my friend?

02:47.334 --> 02:49.620
His story. Russian mafia.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.501
Supposed
international arms dealer.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.333
But no-one I know
has heard of you.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.749
- Shows how much you know.
- And that fake accent.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.588
Is that supposed to be Russian?

02:58.762 --> 03:00.753
I mean, take an acting class,
for god's sake.

03:00.931 --> 03:03.217
You sound like Mickey Rourke
in 'lron man 2'.

03:03.392 --> 03:05.223
He's just guessing, testing him.

03:05.394 --> 03:08.010
We're good.
Nothing to worry about.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.944
Alright, you got me.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.326
- Oh, crap.
- My head's just not in the game.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.157
This whole spy stuff's
new to me.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.367
You know, it's weird.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.248
Being a soldier came naturally.

03:30.419 --> 03:33.206
This stuff, you know,
not so much.

03:33.380 --> 03:36.838
But there is
one thing I'm good at.

03:37.008 --> 03:39.169
What's that?

03:40.595 --> 03:42.426
Kicking ass.

04:24.848 --> 04:27.510
- Holy hell.
- I told ya.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.794
Heads up! Come on! Let's go!

04:45.869 --> 04:47.484
Huh?

04:47.662 --> 04:49.493
Man: Kill him!

05:09.100 --> 05:11.341
Oh, you're kidding me!

05:21.154 --> 05:22.985
Come on! Ugh!

05:26.159 --> 05:29.822
J give me a sign... j

05:29.996 --> 05:32.703
j hit me, baby,
one more time... &

05:32.874 --> 05:36.287
j my loneliness is killing me

05:36.461 --> 05:38.122
j and I

05:38.296 --> 05:41.504
j I must confess I still believe

05:41.675 --> 05:43.336
j still believe

05:43.510 --> 05:47.002
j when I'm not with you
I lose my mind

05:47.180 --> 05:50.718
j give me a sign

05:50.892 --> 05:54.601
- & hit me, baby, one more time
- D I must confess... j

05:54.771 --> 05:57.308
man: Jj!

05:57.482 --> 05:59.598
- Way to go, killer.
- Thank you.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.233
The man, the myth.

06:02.404 --> 06:05.441
Oh, man.
Bobbi ulf, tech support.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.731
Can I just say,
it's an honour to meet you.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.901
I have read every page
of your case file

06:11.079 --> 06:14.617
and it's a page-Turner,
like 'fifty shades of amazing'.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.658
Kim needs to see you asap
for the debrief.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.918
You got it. Awesome. Awesome.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.545
Have a good day.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.048
Whoops.

06:25.218 --> 06:28.176
Well, kicked a bunch of ass.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.177
Quite the cowboy. Yeah.

06:30.348 --> 06:31.838
- Very heroic!
- Thanks, boss.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.633
No, I'm being sarcast...

06:34.811 --> 06:37.723
The mission wasn't just
to stop a sale, jj.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.729
The goal was to find out
what they knew

06:39.900 --> 06:41.936
so we could take
the rest of the network down.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.193
But that's kinda difficult now,
seeing that you killed everyone.

06:45.363 --> 06:49.697
Gregovich.
Hassan's head of finance.

06:49.868 --> 06:51.548
Hassan's head.

06:51.703 --> 06:55.070
Look, it's because of you
we have nothing.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.704
We've got the plutonium core.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.581
Turns out there are two cores,
actually.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.788
This man, azar,
just got away with it,

07:00.962 --> 07:03.078
the only one you didn't kill.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.996
Now he has half of what he needs

07:05.175 --> 07:06.836
to blow up a major city.

07:07.010 --> 07:11.344
Look, your special forces
record is impeccable.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.551
But intelligence is a different
kind of ball game.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.889
You know, spy craft
requires finesse,

07:18.063 --> 07:20.475
nuance, emotional intelligence.

07:20.649 --> 07:23.561
I've got those. I have plenty
of emotional intelligence.

07:23.735 --> 07:26.602
So you're saying
that you can just read

07:26.780 --> 07:29.613
the slightest and most subtle
of facial cues

07:29.783 --> 07:31.489
to assess
a target's temperament?

07:31.660 --> 07:32.945
Absolutely.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.659
What does my face say?

07:41.836 --> 07:43.542
Should I start reading now?

07:43.713 --> 07:44.953
Oh, my god.

07:45.131 --> 07:48.715
Look, jj, I respect you, ok?

07:48.885 --> 07:50.750
You put up some big wins for us.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.794
But, with all due respect, I...

07:52.973 --> 07:55.680
I just don't think
you're cut out for this.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.556
Take the rest of the day off.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.968
Go home and get some rest,
alright?

08:14.244 --> 08:16.451
Thanks, Jimmy.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.690
Goodnight, blueberry.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.863
Alexa, play something soothing.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.210
Girl: This is
my favourite shirt.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.504
It's just this really cool
French band that I like.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.798
I saw them in a concert
when I lived in France.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.637
I'm really into French music.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.551
Hmm? Yeah.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.220
Now that you mention it,

09:25.398 --> 09:27.104
I guess living in France
was pretty cool.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.936
Come ice-skating
with you Saturday?

09:29.110 --> 09:31.271
Well, I could ask my mom.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.320
Ok, how was that?

09:34.491 --> 09:37.073
I know. I know, ozzie.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.235
I lost them with,
"I'm really into French music."

09:56.513 --> 09:59.095
Cool shirt. Did you get
that from my room?

09:59.265 --> 10:01.221
Hmm? Oh, yeah.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.428
- How's school going?
- Great.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.264
Elementary school girls

10:05.438 --> 10:07.975
are really warm and welcoming
to new kids.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.469
We're, like, the first ones
they invite to all the parties.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.693
- You know what I think?
- Not too late to homeschool me?

10:13.863 --> 10:15.444
No.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.901
I think that if you're
just yourself

10:18.076 --> 10:20.818
that you are going to make
some good friends

10:20.995 --> 10:22.906
who see how awesome you are,
just like I do.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.786
Who?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.702
All the parents of kids who
don't get invited to parties.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.579
Are you gonna eat your egg?

10:32.757 --> 10:34.418
No, thanks.

10:38.096 --> 10:40.052
- Boy: Watch out.
- Boy 2: Coming through!

10:40.223 --> 10:42.054
Boy: Yeah, Chicago won.

10:43.476 --> 10:47.139
Yo, what's up, guys?
Yo, get out of my seat.

10:54.529 --> 10:57.145
- What is that?
- Oh, this?

10:57.323 --> 10:59.314
It's this French band
when I was...

10:59.492 --> 11:00.948
Oh, my god. It's jelly.

11:01.119 --> 11:02.984
You have jelly, like,
all over your face.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.074
Girl: Definitely posting that
on insta.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.909
Actually, I'm... I'm not allowed

11:07.083 --> 11:08.763
to have pictures of myself
on the Internet.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.375
It's my mom.
She's afraid of cyberbullies.

11:11.546 --> 11:14.253
Who would bully you?

11:15.300 --> 11:18.383
So, I heard there was going to
be this big ice-skating party.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.589
Oh, my god. It's already gotten,
like, eight likes.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.015
Kim: Despite our failure
in Russia,

11:34.194 --> 11:36.230
the NSA has come up with a lead.

11:36.404 --> 11:39.567
They believe Hassan
had been working with this man,

11:39.741 --> 11:42.403
Victor Marquez,
former French special ops.

11:42.577 --> 11:45.319
He's a French national
who's been trading illegal arms

11:45.496 --> 11:47.157
for the past two decades.

11:47.332 --> 11:51.075
Victor has recently stepped up
his game into the nuclear arena

11:51.252 --> 11:54.164
and has acquired something
truly dangerous -

11:54.339 --> 11:56.375
Soviet schematics
for a miniaturised nuke.

11:56.549 --> 12:00.462
For years, he's worked hand
in hand with his brother, David.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.844
There were reports of a power
struggle between the two.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.754
David didn't want his brother

12:04.933 --> 12:07.140
to have the nuclear plans
and hid them.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.016
Enraged, Victor killed him.

12:09.187 --> 12:10.893
Later he was almost captured
by police,

12:11.064 --> 12:13.146
but he escaped
and is still on the run.

12:15.151 --> 12:18.188
Oh, that poor lady.
Does anyone know if she's ok?

12:24.911 --> 12:26.822
She's fine.

12:26.996 --> 12:30.159
If Marquez finds those plans
and sells them to azar... boom!

12:30.333 --> 12:34.326
Our mission? Take down Marquez
before he can locate the plans.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.165
Do we know his whereabouts?

12:36.339 --> 12:38.500
NSA believes he's headed
to Berlin to meet with azar.

12:38.675 --> 12:42.133
- Yes! Love Berlin.
- Christina, you'll take it.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.669
We also have intel from MI6.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.428
Decrypted messaging suggests

12:46.599 --> 12:49.432
that Marquez has been in contact
with his lawyer from Paris,

12:49.602 --> 12:51.843
an international
scumbag named koll.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.433
- Paris is cool too.
- Christina, yours also.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.438
- C'est bon.
- Jj?

12:56.609 --> 12:58.270
Yes, sir.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.309
You'll be on surveillance
with Bobbi.

13:00.488 --> 13:03.525
- Excuse me?
- No way.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.861
Dead brother's wife
moved back to the us.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.071
Her level of involvement
is unclear.

13:08.246 --> 13:11.409
Until we capture Marquez, it's
best that we keep an eye on her.

13:11.582 --> 13:14.119
This is your last shot.

13:24.387 --> 13:28.471
Song: J oh, you feel it creep,
creeping at the tempo

13:28.641 --> 13:32.259
j don't you need it?
Pump, pumping till it crumble

13:32.437 --> 13:35.270
j trouble,
trouble's what you need

13:35.440 --> 13:37.476
j that's what you get
in getting me... j

13:37.650 --> 13:39.481
yep, this is it.

13:40.778 --> 13:44.270
J I'm a fire
just to spark under your halo

13:44.449 --> 13:47.065
j rolling thunder, I'm high up
ain't got no shame... j

13:47.243 --> 13:50.110
this is amazing.
Finally in the field.

13:50.288 --> 13:53.496
And with you, of all people,
on my first mission.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.827
Babysitting civilians
is not a mission.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.617
And there is no "you and me".

13:59.047 --> 14:01.379
Well, if this isn't a mission,

14:01.549 --> 14:03.505
then what's this?

14:03.676 --> 14:05.337
Plan b. Yeah.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.173
For an important and
potentially dangerous mission.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.760
Do not touch.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.096
Sorry, blueberry.

14:22.570 --> 14:25.027
Bobbi: Home sweet home.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.564
Jj: Oh, Paris, this is not.

14:27.742 --> 14:31.234
Ooh! Dibs on the bed!

14:31.412 --> 14:33.619
Yeah, you can have it.
I'll take the couch.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.701
- That's blood.
- Oh, that's not blood.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.581
That might be sriracha,
or something.

14:37.752 --> 14:40.915
- Maybe they ate in bed.
- No, that's blood.

14:43.841 --> 14:46.423
- Mission brief's in.
- Finally. Showtime.

14:46.594 --> 14:50.803
Alright. Kate vale,
wife of David Marquez, deceased.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.804
Originally from Chicago.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.120
Moved back from Paris three
months ago with her daughter.

14:55.144 --> 14:58.136
No close family.
No active social media.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.350
She's an er nurse
at county hospital.

15:00.525 --> 15:02.766
- Think the job's a cover?
- I don't know.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.860
Alright, that's her daughter,
Sophie. Nine years old.

15:07.031 --> 15:09.693
Just started 4th grade
at oak tree charter.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.108
Meh, I could definitely
take her.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.654
Let's get to work.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.561
Alright, let's make this quick.

15:42.483 --> 15:45.850
Shh! Shh!

15:48.573 --> 15:51.235
That's amazing. Do you always
have bacon on you?

15:51.409 --> 15:53.149
Yeah.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.568
The closet?
That's a little mean.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.328
I'm gonna search the apartment.
Get the cameras set up.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.868
Alright. Cameras are up, jj.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.253
- And they all check out.
- Copy that.

16:06.424 --> 16:07.834
Just wrapping it up here.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.419
Oh, she's back.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.255
Kate: I got my check
at the restaurant

16:11.429 --> 16:13.090
before I realised
I forgot my wallet.

16:13.264 --> 16:15.175
I know. I know. I'm losing it.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.010
Uh, well, no,
I'm gonna grab it now.

16:17.185 --> 16:18.846
I'll be there in 20.
Do not worry.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.681
- Bobbi: Hide!
- Jj: Where?

16:20.855 --> 16:22.595
Somewhere a w...
A wallet wouldn't be.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.308
Kate: You know how I drive.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.194
I'll see you soon. 'Bye.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.574
Huh.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.445
Stop. Stop it. Stop it.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.117
Bobbi: Ok, she is just
tearing the place apart.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.207
Ok, she's coming down
the hallway.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.501
Oh, she's in the room.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.847
Oh, my god.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.807
What's my next move?

17:03.981 --> 17:07.644
She's in the kitchen.
Evac in five, four... now.

17:07.818 --> 17:10.230
Out the front door, out the
front door. And we freeze.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.984
Go, go, go, go.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.248
Bobbi: Aw, that's nice.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.544
I'm losing my mind.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.311
God, I can't take this.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.146
I know.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.561
The tension, the anticipation,
the excitement.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.400
You could get addicted

17:55.575 --> 17:57.236
to the adrenaline high
pretty quickly.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.116
No, the boredom.

17:59.287 --> 18:02.324
Oh, yeah. I know.
There's so many layers, huh?

18:02.498 --> 18:06.366
Hey, I just wanna say I'm real
excited to be learning from you.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.626
Jj: I am not
teaching you anything.

18:08.796 --> 18:11.583
I don't know. It's more of
a mentor/mentee relationship.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.624
- We have zero relationship.
- Yet.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.722
But we're building toward
something pretty great.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.507
I can just feel it.

18:18.681 --> 18:22.640
You'll share your harrowing
experiences in the field.

18:22.810 --> 18:25.267
And I'll show you some...

18:26.355 --> 18:29.222
Do not touch.

18:29.400 --> 18:33.643
Ok, that was awesome.
That's what I'm talking about!

18:33.821 --> 18:35.732
You gotta teach me
how to do stuff like this.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.238
With your lack of motor skills,
that would be impossible.

18:38.409 --> 18:40.775
You're the tech. I'm the action.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.491
Oh, yeah, well, maybe I become
the action, surprising everyone.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.997
You might need me
to save your ass in a pinch.

18:47.168 --> 18:49.454
You will never save my ass.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.041
Assist? I could assist you.

18:52.214 --> 18:55.547
Come on, it couldn't hurt
to show me a few things, huh?

18:55.718 --> 18:58.881
Just in case...

19:01.515 --> 19:03.346
Ow.

19:10.941 --> 19:13.227
Kate: Hey.
Close the door, please.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.233
Thank you.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.485
I know that face.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.196
What face?

19:22.370 --> 19:25.737
The "I'm about to drop some
disappointing news on you" face.

19:25.915 --> 19:29.908
No. This is my "should we
have spaghetti tonight?" Face.

19:31.796 --> 19:34.913
Which also looks like my
"we can't go ice-skating" face.

19:35.091 --> 19:36.547
Mom!

19:36.717 --> 19:38.862
I'm doing an extra shift
at the hospital, Sophie. Sorry.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.592
- Everyone's going.
- I know, I know.

19:40.763 --> 19:42.424
But I don't have a choice.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.918
Listen, how about when I get
home we do something together?

19:45.059 --> 19:46.720
- We can go to the movies.
- Sure.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.977
Hanging out with my mom is
way cooler than making friends!

19:50.147 --> 19:52.183
I hate this place!

19:53.693 --> 19:55.809
Yeah. Me too.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.773
Man: Oh, so, because we're gay,
you just assume we ice-skate?

19:58.948 --> 20:01.280
We see sparkles and sequins
and hear céline Dion music,

20:01.450 --> 20:03.111
and we just can't
help ourselves, huh?

20:03.285 --> 20:05.321
- Like moths to a flame.
- Oh, my goodness.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.157
No, I'm sorry.
That... that's not...

20:07.331 --> 20:09.993
I'm just playing, girl.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.078
Of course we ice-skate!
Are you kidding?

20:12.253 --> 20:14.289
Todd and I met
at an ice-dancing class.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.704
That's where I fell for him.
Ain't that right, t?

20:16.882 --> 20:19.498
That... that was a yes.

20:19.677 --> 20:22.464
Anyhoo, we'd love to lace up
and hit the rink with soph,

20:22.638 --> 20:24.754
but I have a million and one
errands to run tomorrow,

20:24.932 --> 20:26.593
and Todd is working from home.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.553
- He's a therapist.
- He's a therapist?

20:28.728 --> 20:31.561
The way people open up to him
is really amazing.

20:31.731 --> 20:35.519
If you ever need someone
to talk to about life or work

20:35.693 --> 20:38.776
or what your hair colour choices
say about you...

20:38.946 --> 20:40.777
Oh, oh, actually,
this wasn't a choice.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.360
- This is my natural colour.
- Mm-hm.

20:43.534 --> 20:45.274
No choice js a choice.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.739
But we will definitely
keep an eye on her for you.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.619
Don't worry. Nothing gets by us.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.122
Ain't that right, t?

20:53.169 --> 20:55.501
- That was a yes too.
- Yeah?

21:21.864 --> 21:24.446
We got a bogey.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.448
The dog found our camera.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.827
Oh, this is not good.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.842
Oh, ok, she doesn't know
what she's looking at.

21:36.879 --> 21:38.540
It's impossible to tell
that's a camera.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.375
Are you sure?

21:40.549 --> 21:42.289
Even if she did know,
she can't trace it.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.129
It's all wireless and encrypted.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.134
Jj: 1 don't know.
She's onto something.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.029
Hmm.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.993
Man: Yeah, chicken piccata
with the broccolini you like,

22:15.167 --> 22:17.032
but you're on ice-cream detail.

22:17.211 --> 22:18.872
Hey, Carlos.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.957
And no vanilla. How basic!

22:22.967 --> 22:25.458
Bobbi: Hey. And 20, 25.

22:25.636 --> 22:27.672
Keep the change. Thank you.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.197
Bobbi: Come on,
let's review what we missed

22:33.352 --> 22:35.434
when we were
buying groceries last night.

22:40.150 --> 22:43.483
Kate: How was school?
You learn anything good?

22:43.654 --> 22:45.519
What are you drawing?

22:45.698 --> 22:48.064
Sophie: Nothing.

22:48.242 --> 22:49.607
Kate: Hmm.

22:49.785 --> 22:52.401
"Oh, hey, mom,
how was your day?"

22:52.580 --> 22:55.162
Well, actually, it was, um...

22:55.332 --> 22:57.914
It was really intense
and stressful.

22:58.085 --> 23:01.122
This three-car mvc
with mass casualties

23:01.297 --> 23:03.913
and... and multiple
amputations and...

23:04.091 --> 23:06.924
Blood just gushing everywhere.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.755
Sophie:
Did that actually happen?

23:08.929 --> 23:12.171
Kate: No. I'm just trying
fo get you to say something.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.340
Are you still mad at me
about the ice-skating?

23:16.353 --> 23:18.309
That's tough -
mom's trying so hard

23:18.480 --> 23:20.436
and that bratty kid
won't give her a break.

23:20.608 --> 23:22.928
- I don't think she's bratty.
- Hey, how'd you get in here?

23:23.068 --> 23:24.979
Ok, she has a camera.
She might be streaming.

23:25.154 --> 23:27.190
- Are you guys CIA?
- No.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.025
What makes you think we're CIA?

23:29.199 --> 23:32.111
Are you guys watching us
in case my uncle comes back?

23:35.706 --> 23:38.038
No. He hates my mom.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.574
One time they got into a fight
at Christmas.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.584
She poured wine
all over his head

23:42.755 --> 23:44.586
at this really fancy restaurant.

23:46.592 --> 23:49.425
Ooh, I wouldn't touch that.
He doesn't like that.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.756
Jj: You've stumbled into
a very sensitive situation,

23:51.931 --> 23:53.296
little lady.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.517
Before you get yourself
in big trouble?

23:58.687 --> 24:00.803
But won't you get in big trouble

24:00.981 --> 24:03.063
for having your cover blown
by a 9-year-old

24:03.233 --> 24:05.440
who's recording this
and streaming it to the cloud?

24:05.611 --> 24:08.569
With just one click, I could
send this video to everyone.

24:08.739 --> 24:10.570
Can she do that?

24:10.741 --> 24:13.278
Yeah. Not actually that hard.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.279
Look, little girl,
we're your friends.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.448
We're here to help you.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.226
We're here to protect
you and your mommy.

24:22.336 --> 24:24.372
Then why are you keeping
this all a secret

24:24.546 --> 24:26.252
and hiding cameras
in our apartment?

24:26.423 --> 24:29.665
Ok, uh, sidebar? Hmm? Hm.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.972
Alright, we're blown.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.102
- Protocol says we pull out.
- No way.

24:43.273 --> 24:45.980
If Kim finds out we got made by
a 9-year-old, my career's over.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.142
What's the option?

24:48.320 --> 24:50.652
Kill her.
Make it look like an accident.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.939
Yeah. Maybe the stairs. “What?

24:55.411 --> 24:59.404
Uh, that... came off way worse
than I meant.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.412
I was kidding.
That was a joke. Right?

25:01.583 --> 25:02.948
It was funny.

25:03.127 --> 25:04.742
I'll tell you what -

25:04.920 --> 25:07.662
I'll show my mom this video
or we can cut a deal.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.126
Oh, damn, she's good.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.131
What kind of deal?

25:14.221 --> 25:14.380
Just to be clear, this is
a one-time arrangement.

25:14.388 --> 25:16.845
Just to be clear, this is
a one-time arrangement.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.632
Never again. We're out of here
in 40 minutes, understood?

25:19.810 --> 25:21.641
Yeah, got it.

25:24.773 --> 25:26.434
Woman: And what
can I get for you?

25:26.608 --> 25:28.189
Sophie: Size 4, please.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.975
- And you, sir?
- No skates for me.

25:30.154 --> 25:31.815
You're not going to skate?

25:31.989 --> 25:34.150
I said I'd bring you skating.
I didn't say I'd skate.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.940
You're going to make me
go alone?

25:37.119 --> 25:39.826
Come on, I mean,
don't you guys have some saying

25:39.997 --> 25:41.703
like, "no-one left behind"
or something?

25:41.874 --> 25:43.785
Yeah. But you're not a soldier.

25:43.959 --> 25:47.247
Wait. Do you not know how?

25:47.421 --> 25:50.037
You've got 30 minutes,
then we're leaving.

25:50.215 --> 25:53.582
When you look out there,
what do you see?

25:53.761 --> 25:58.846
90 civilians, minimal security,
soft perimeter. No cover.

25:59.016 --> 26:03.055
Smiling people having fun.
You should try it sometime.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.310
29 minutes.

26:05.481 --> 26:08.598
What, are you afraid?

26:16.992 --> 26:18.823
Size 15.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.672
What are you waiting for?
Anyone can skate.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.503
Ok, ok. I got it.

26:35.677 --> 26:37.668
Ugh!

26:37.846 --> 26:40.258
Whoa. Are you ok?

26:40.432 --> 26:41.763
I'm fine.

26:41.934 --> 26:44.266
Nice move! Ba-boom!

26:44.436 --> 26:46.142
Shut up.

26:46.313 --> 26:48.645
Ok, I'm gonna go
say hi to some friends.

26:50.651 --> 26:53.267
Hey, mister,
you gonna fall again?

26:53.445 --> 26:56.437
- No.
- You sure? You're shaking.

26:56.615 --> 26:57.980
Well, if I am, it's with anger,

26:58.158 --> 27:00.490
thinking about
what I'm gonna do to you.

27:04.373 --> 27:05.988
Hey, you guys.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.782
- Uh, what are you doing here?
- Oh, I come here all the time.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.622
Maybe we could skate together.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.912
Yeah, well, we're kind of
doing our own thing.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.796
Boy: Hey, guys,
we're gonna play tag.

27:14.967 --> 27:18.175
- Boy 2: Come on!
- Be right over! Later.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.511
Oh, thank god.

27:43.537 --> 27:46.370
Boys: Arggh!

27:48.125 --> 27:51.959
You're outta here!
Zero-tolerance bullying policy.

27:52.129 --> 27:53.960
Well, they started it!

28:05.434 --> 28:07.800
So, what happened to you
out there?

28:08.854 --> 28:10.515
What happened to you?

28:10.689 --> 28:13.226
I think I broke something.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.607
Deep inside.

28:17.738 --> 28:20.980
Ice-cream will make you
feel better. It always helps me.

28:21.158 --> 28:23.524
No. Ice-cream wasn't part
of the deal.

28:23.702 --> 28:27.160
Would you like to explain that
to my mom?

28:33.420 --> 28:35.331
Well?

28:35.505 --> 28:37.336
I feel a little better.

28:37.507 --> 28:39.247
Me too.

28:39.426 --> 28:42.133
- So0, we're cool, right?
- What do you mean?

28:42.304 --> 28:46.422
I mean, you can't tell anybody
who I am or what I do.

28:46.600 --> 28:49.558
You have to go back to living
your life and leave us alone.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.639
Relax, we're cool.

28:52.731 --> 28:56.098
- What's that?
- Pinky promise.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.608
- Seriously?
- Go on.

29:01.949 --> 29:03.655
You were supposed
to be watching her!

29:03.825 --> 29:05.678
- Anything could've happened...
- Oh, my god! There she is!

29:05.702 --> 29:07.363
And who are you,
touching pinkies?

29:07.537 --> 29:09.528
- Mom, wait! Oh, my god.
- Ugh!

29:09.706 --> 29:11.537
Let go of my daughter!
Give me my phone!

29:11.708 --> 29:13.770
- I'm calling the police.
- Mom, you don't understand.

29:13.794 --> 29:15.876
I ignored your rules
and went to the park.

29:16.046 --> 29:17.707
There were these two jerks
from school

29:17.881 --> 29:19.542
that pushed me down
and it really hurt.

29:19.716 --> 29:21.377
And jj saw it.
He lives upstairs.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.257
He recognised me
from the building

29:23.428 --> 29:25.009
and calmly talked to the boys

29:25.180 --> 29:26.886
and told them
what they did was wrong,

29:27.057 --> 29:29.924
then got ice-cream to make me
feel better and walked me home!

29:30.102 --> 29:32.309
Oh, my lord and Taylor!
How did you do that?

29:32.479 --> 29:35.391
He has muscles the size of hams!
Todd, did you see that?

29:35.565 --> 29:37.556
I know!
Todd can't believe it either.

29:37.734 --> 29:40.146
Oh, I, um... I'm sorry.
This is my kid.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.527
- Can I just help you...
- No.

29:42.698 --> 29:44.404
No, it's ok, I'm good.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.940
I'm just gonna head home
and gather my thoughts.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.405
Really, I'm fine. Excuse me.

29:51.999 --> 29:55.036
I think you made
a little pee come out.

29:58.005 --> 30:00.212
What happened to you?

30:00.382 --> 30:02.043
I can't even talk about it.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.017
Let's just say the situation
has been handled.

30:04.052 --> 30:06.384
- Oh, my god, you killed her!
- Shut up.

30:12.227 --> 30:13.888
Hey, big fella!

30:14.062 --> 30:15.768
How are the huevos?

30:15.939 --> 30:18.021
- Yeah, they're fine.
- Really?

30:18.191 --> 30:20.728
Because it looked like you
were in a lot of pain yesterday.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.688
No, I'm ok.

30:22.863 --> 30:25.525
Todd said he thought
he saw you crying.

30:25.699 --> 30:27.735
What? I wasn't crying.

30:27.909 --> 30:29.865
Todd was wondering
what you did for work.

30:30.037 --> 30:31.698
He's such a busybody,

30:31.872 --> 30:33.737
always interrogating
the new neighbours.

30:33.915 --> 30:36.201
I'm taking a break right now,
trying to figure it out.

30:36.376 --> 30:40.244
Welcome to the building, jj.
We'll see you around.

30:40.422 --> 30:42.378
Yeah, thanks.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.561
Kate: Sophie, help!

30:58.732 --> 31:00.563
I need you! Now!

31:02.027 --> 31:05.110
Jj! I was just coming
to get you! Come on, hurry!

31:05.280 --> 31:07.236
Sophie, bring me
some more towels, please!

31:07.407 --> 31:09.318
- Mom, jj's here.
- What? Why?

31:09.493 --> 31:11.279
- Here, let me help.
- Uh, no.

31:11.453 --> 31:13.193
I've got this under control.
But thank you.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.078
It's the plumbing
in these old buildings.

31:15.248 --> 31:16.909
I just need to tighten the pipe.

31:17.084 --> 31:19.291
It's not a pipe,
it's a loose fitting.

31:23.757 --> 31:26.339
Ozzie, no!

31:26.510 --> 31:28.546
That is so weird.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.381
He usually hates strangers,

31:30.555 --> 31:32.546
but he seems to be
inordinately into you.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.931
- Jj: Yeah, that is weird.
- Oh, come here, baby.

31:35.102 --> 31:37.093
I guess you were right
about the fitting.

31:37.270 --> 31:40.808
Yeah. I just don't understand
what happened.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.938
Maybe jj could stay for dinner?

31:43.110 --> 31:44.975
- Hmm?
- No, I couldn't possibly.

31:45.153 --> 31:47.064
I think you could.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.031
Bobbi: Oh, my god.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.786
We're out of olive oil.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.918
There's a new bottle
in the back, behind the mustard.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.703
I'd... bet.

32:04.881 --> 32:07.293
Thanks.

32:11.847 --> 32:14.714
Oh, excuse me for a second.
I... I'd better take this.

32:14.891 --> 32:16.631
Sure.

32:20.147 --> 32:22.433
- Hey.
- Hey, glad I caught you.

32:22.607 --> 32:25.349
I was just calling to see
why you're drinking rosé

32:25.527 --> 32:28.018
in the bathroom
of our target's house!

32:28.196 --> 32:30.653
Wait. Did you put a camera
in the bathroom?

32:30.824 --> 32:32.906
What kind of perv
puts a camera in the bathroom?

32:33.076 --> 32:34.691
A genius pervert, that's who.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.986
People go there when
they don't want to be heard.

32:37.164 --> 32:38.964
- Apparently.
- Hey, don't make this about me.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.739
What the hell
are you doing in there?

32:40.917 --> 32:43.329
- They invited me for dinner.
- And you said yes?!

32:43.503 --> 32:45.585
I had no choice.
The kid ambushed me.

32:45.755 --> 32:47.711
Ok, alright, um, we're gonna
get through this.

32:47.883 --> 32:50.841
Um... I g... guess...
Here's what we're gonna do.

32:51.011 --> 32:52.376
You're gonna go to dinner,

32:52.554 --> 32:54.215
and you're gonna be polite
and innocuous,

32:54.389 --> 32:56.095
and then you will get
the hell out.

32:56.266 --> 32:57.927
You think?

32:58.101 --> 33:00.308
- Do you have any better ideas?
- Yes.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.219
I'll dose them
with sodium pentothal

33:02.397 --> 33:04.375
while you hack the cloud,
get the kid's recordings.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.811
Then we wire the building
so it looks like a gas leak.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.600
Boom. Zero evidence.
We're outta here.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.110
Alright, fine,
we'll go with your idea.

33:14.284 --> 33:16.900
Mm, sorry,
the chicken's a little dry.

33:17.078 --> 33:19.694
Mm, yeah,
it's really overcooked.

33:21.208 --> 33:24.541
Well, you think this is bad? Mm.

33:24.711 --> 33:27.248
One time in Afghanistan,
we were cut off for a month,

33:27.422 --> 33:29.253
and all we had to eat
were these lizards.

33:29.424 --> 33:32.040
We couldn't shoot 'em 'cause
that would attract the enemy,

33:32.219 --> 33:34.551
so we had to bash their
little heads in with rocks.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.382
Really messy work.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.217
Then we had to cook 'em
over c-4,

33:38.391 --> 33:40.723
which gave them
this awful chemical taste.

33:40.894 --> 33:42.555
But, hell, by that time

33:42.729 --> 33:44.640
we were drinking our own urine
anyway, so...

33:51.780 --> 33:55.147
Um... I'm really sorry.

33:55.325 --> 33:58.442
I haven't had dinner
with civilians in a long time.

33:58.620 --> 34:02.579
Hey, mom, I was thinking,
since you can't take me

34:02.749 --> 34:04.852
to parents and special friends
day tomorrow at school,

34:04.876 --> 34:06.707
maybe jj could take me.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.163
I don't think
that's the best idea.

34:11.341 --> 34:13.502
- Not the best idea.
- Why not?

34:13.677 --> 34:15.417
Because I'm sure he's very busy.

34:15.594 --> 34:19.007
- Very busy.
- He's not. He's unemployed.

34:19.181 --> 34:21.969
He just sits around all day
watching tvs.

34:22.143 --> 34:25.851
Sophie, that's not very nice.

34:26.022 --> 34:27.808
No, not nice.

34:27.983 --> 34:29.862
It's just... everyone else
has someone to bring,

34:29.900 --> 34:31.937
and you said you can't
get out of work,

34:32.112 --> 34:35.024
and I'm not
going to have anybody.

34:35.197 --> 34:37.905
And I'm gonna be the only one.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.867
Please?

34:49.170 --> 34:51.377
Seriously? Special friends day?

34:51.547 --> 34:53.208
That kid is tricky, man.

34:53.382 --> 34:55.168
I miss dealing with terrorists.

34:55.342 --> 34:58.756
- Sophie: Goodnight, jj!
- Oh, she's good.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.921
And goodnight
to your lesbian friend too.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.015
Jj: So, what are we walking
into here?

35:08.189 --> 35:10.225
I don't know. This is
my first special friends day.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.160
Weak intel is never
a good starting position.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.896
Noted.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.731
Remember, I need to keep
a low profile,

35:15.905 --> 35:17.861
so no discussing
who I am or what I do.

35:18.033 --> 35:19.694
And this is it.

35:19.868 --> 35:21.908
No more special persons days
or skating or anything.

35:22.037 --> 35:23.698
I've got a job to do.

35:23.872 --> 35:26.284
This ain't gonna end up
like some movie, with you and me

35:26.458 --> 35:28.699
sitting in little chairs,
having a tea party with dolls.

35:28.877 --> 35:32.210
Hey, and just to be clear,
I'm onto you.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.166
I know you busted the sink.

35:34.341 --> 35:36.878
I don't know
what you're talking about.

35:38.261 --> 35:39.967
Once upon a time,
there was a little girl

35:40.138 --> 35:41.799
who got way too big
for her britches.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.089
Then one day she disappeared

35:44.267 --> 35:46.258
and no-one ever found the body.

35:46.436 --> 35:48.677
You like stories? I got a story.

35:48.855 --> 35:51.016
Once there was a CIA agent

35:51.191 --> 35:53.147
that put cameras
in a little girl's bathroom

35:53.318 --> 35:56.025
while seducing her mom
over chicken and wine.

35:56.196 --> 35:58.687
Pretty sure they don't
teach that at Langley.

35:58.865 --> 36:02.073
Jesus Christ!

36:14.923 --> 36:17.209
You can't back out now.
We're here.

36:17.384 --> 36:19.340
I'm not backing out.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.251
I just never liked school
very much.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.511
No-one does. It's school.

36:23.682 --> 36:26.970
We're all just trying
to survive it.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.884
Come on.

36:36.361 --> 36:37.851
Welcome, everyone.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.610
Our students are so excited

36:39.781 --> 36:41.521
to be able to show off
their school today,

36:41.700 --> 36:43.691
so why don't we begin

36:43.868 --> 36:47.281
by meeting a few of our parents
and special friends?

36:47.455 --> 36:50.242
Who would like to go first?

36:50.417 --> 36:52.533
- Andre.
- Ibrought my mom.

36:57.674 --> 36:59.039
Hi.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.173
I'm Tina, and I help people
manage their money

37:01.344 --> 37:03.300
so that by the time
they decide to stop working,

37:03.471 --> 37:04.836
they have a nest egg.

37:05.014 --> 37:06.550
My team and I make the schedule

37:06.725 --> 37:08.306
for all the flights
at the airline,

37:08.476 --> 37:10.717
which is over 3,000 a day.

37:10.895 --> 37:13.352
And by controlling
this tiny little robot,

37:13.523 --> 37:17.061
I can actually repair
the heart valve from the inside

37:17.235 --> 37:18.600
and with this procedure,

37:18.778 --> 37:20.939
I save
over a hundred lives a year.

37:26.828 --> 37:29.490
Sophie, who do you have
with you today?

37:32.208 --> 37:35.325
- Uh, my hand wasn't up.
- That's ok.

37:39.340 --> 37:42.798
Um, this is
my special friend, jj.

37:49.184 --> 37:50.674
Jj: Excuse me. - Girl: Ow!

37:50.852 --> 37:52.388
God. I'm sorry, kid.

37:53.438 --> 37:54.974
- Ah.
- Oh, god.

37:55.148 --> 37:58.106
- Girl: Ow! That's my foot!
- Jj: Sorry.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.900
Hi, everyone. Uh, my name is jj.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.312
Uh...

38:04.491 --> 38:08.951
Professionally, I'm exploring
my options right now.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.985
- Unemployed.
- Shh.

38:14.501 --> 38:16.207
In my former line of work,
I was...

38:19.005 --> 38:20.370
I took out garbage.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.334
I took it out
all over the world, actually.

38:22.509 --> 38:24.625
Oh, my god. Sad.

38:24.803 --> 38:28.637
Manners, class. Everyone's
experiences are valuable, ok?

38:28.807 --> 38:30.263
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

38:30.433 --> 38:32.515
She's so weird.
Why would she bring him?

38:41.986 --> 38:44.944
When I said
I took out the garbage...

38:50.370 --> 38:51.826
I meant human trash.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.032
The truth is

38:54.207 --> 38:56.789
I'm a former army ranger

38:56.960 --> 38:58.996
who now works for
secret operations

38:59.170 --> 39:00.831
for a us intelligence agency

39:01.005 --> 39:06.796
that may or may not
or may be the CIA.

39:09.347 --> 39:12.180
Well, I'm not really
supposed to talk about it,

39:12.350 --> 39:17.720
but I saw some judging
and some unkindness,

39:17.897 --> 39:19.933
so I just wanted
to set the record straight.

39:22.360 --> 39:26.854
But if any of this information
were to leave this room,

39:27.031 --> 39:28.862
I will find you.

39:30.159 --> 39:31.774
No, I'm just kidding.

39:34.455 --> 39:36.070
Sort of.

39:36.249 --> 39:38.786
Have you ever been shot? Yes.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.042
- Can we see the scars?
- Helen!

39:41.212 --> 39:43.294
- Have you ever killed anyone?
- How many?

39:43.464 --> 39:45.705
Look,
that's not what's important.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.374
What you have
to remember here is,

39:47.552 --> 39:49.292
is they were all bad guys,
you know?

39:49.470 --> 39:54.339
Terrorists, hijackers,
kidnappers, human traffickers

39:54.517 --> 39:57.554
or just really annoying.

39:58.646 --> 40:01.137
Yeah, I really don't think
we need to be celebrating this.

40:01.316 --> 40:03.432
Sit down, hal.
You've had your turn.

40:03.610 --> 40:06.067
And everything I did

40:06.237 --> 40:09.445
was in the service
of keeping America safe.

40:15.538 --> 40:18.245
Earl st Clair: J my friend say
I should live a little

40:18.416 --> 40:20.828
j need to start saying yes more

40:21.002 --> 40:23.414
j I comprise
and meet him in the middle

40:23.588 --> 40:25.795
j 'cause new actions
will get you new results... j

40:28.927 --> 40:31.543
j it's life
and I'm supposed to live it out

40:31.721 --> 40:33.928
j I'm holding on to the universe

40:34.098 --> 40:36.089
j praying that
she don't let me down... j

40:36.267 --> 40:38.679
8, 9, 10.
Ready or not, here I come.

40:38.853 --> 40:41.515
J end up in love, love, love

40:41.689 --> 40:43.805
j if the world
that we live in is crazy... j

40:45.526 --> 40:46.982
found you.

40:47.153 --> 40:49.269
J I'm feeling alive

40:49.447 --> 40:51.984
j I'm feeling alive,
alive, alive

40:52.158 --> 40:54.240
j I'm feeling alive... j

41:04.337 --> 41:06.544
- See you tomorrow, Sophie.
- See you, Emily.

41:08.758 --> 41:12.091
- Hello, jj.
- Hey, ms Besser.

41:12.261 --> 41:13.626
Oh, please, call me Pam.

41:13.805 --> 41:16.797
I just wanted to tell you
how impressed I am

41:16.975 --> 41:19.182
and how glad I was to get to
meet you today.

41:19.352 --> 41:21.718
Thanks. My pleasure.

41:21.896 --> 41:24.638
I think everyone
really enjoyed it.

41:27.318 --> 41:28.979
Have a nice day.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.815
- Well, see you around.
- Alright.

41:34.075 --> 41:36.817
Tear that up. “What?

41:36.995 --> 41:39.202
- You heard me.
- Yeah, but...

41:39.372 --> 41:41.328
Conflict of interest.

41:43.584 --> 41:45.916
- Now eat it.
- No!

41:46.087 --> 41:48.203
- Hey, you guys.
- Mom!

41:48.381 --> 41:51.589
- How'd it go today?
- We had the best day.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.169
See you later, Sophie!

41:53.344 --> 41:54.709
- 'Bye, jj.
- See you.

41:54.887 --> 41:56.377
I'm gonna go say 'bye
to my friends.

41:56.556 --> 41:58.092
Sure.

41:59.767 --> 42:02.429
Wow. Seems you made
quite the impression.

42:05.898 --> 42:07.559
On everyone.

42:07.734 --> 42:10.771
- Thank you for today.
- Yeah. Sure.

42:10.945 --> 42:13.778
Sophie just seems so happy.

43:04.457 --> 43:06.038
How's it going?

43:07.543 --> 43:09.033
We had a deal.

43:09.212 --> 43:10.622
I just wanted to say thank you

43:10.797 --> 43:12.503
for coming to my school
last week.

43:12.673 --> 43:16.086
You made a really big impression
on my friends and my mom.

43:16.260 --> 43:19.673
Yeah, glad I could help...
For the last time.

43:21.057 --> 43:24.015
- You're not married, are you?
- Why?

43:24.185 --> 43:27.177
I'm trying to figure you out.
What's your real story?

43:27.355 --> 43:30.097
Under the rough exterior,
you seem like a nice guy,

43:30.274 --> 43:32.105
but sort of damaged and alone.

43:32.276 --> 43:33.641
You gotta be kidding me.

43:33.820 --> 43:36.186
- I'm thinking dead wife.
- No.

43:36.364 --> 43:37.729
- Dead partner?
- No.

43:37.907 --> 43:39.272
Led a group of buddies
into action,

43:39.450 --> 43:41.736
made a bad call, lost them
and still haunted by it?

43:41.911 --> 43:43.742
Will you stop?

43:45.498 --> 43:49.662
Look, it's hard being deployed.

43:49.836 --> 43:52.794
It's even harder on the people
that you leave at home.

43:52.964 --> 43:54.795
The mission before last,
I got shot.

43:54.966 --> 43:59.255
When I got home, my fiancee
left me. She couldn't take it.

43:59.428 --> 44:03.137
My job's just...
It's better to be alone.

44:03.307 --> 44:06.344
People always seem to get hurt,
one way or another.

44:06.519 --> 44:08.180
So...

44:08.354 --> 44:10.140
Why am I telling you all this?

44:10.314 --> 44:13.101
And the fish is all you have
to remember her by?

44:14.152 --> 44:16.063
Nice talking to you. Wait!

44:16.237 --> 44:19.775
What if I told you I was
thinking about being a spy too

44:19.949 --> 44:21.314
when I grow up?

44:21.492 --> 44:24.029
- Alright. Good luck with that.
- I'm serious.

44:24.203 --> 44:25.989
You don't believe me?

44:26.164 --> 44:30.032
Look, kid,
you're just not the spy type.

44:30.209 --> 44:32.074
Oh, I see.

44:32.253 --> 44:33.789
So, I should just stay in my box

44:33.963 --> 44:35.703
and dream of being
maybe a barista

44:35.882 --> 44:38.794
or a fashion designer
or a wedding planner?

44:38.968 --> 44:41.004
Or maybe an er nurse
like your mother?

44:41.179 --> 44:44.922
You know, I was thinking
of asking Bobbi anyway.

44:45.099 --> 44:47.681
She seems more like
the brains of the operation,

44:47.852 --> 44:49.717
whereas you're more the brawn.

44:50.938 --> 44:53.270
Who are you calling 'brawn'?
Bobbi's an analyst.

44:53.441 --> 44:55.041
She doesn't have an ounce
of my training.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.184
If anybody's gonna teach you,
it's gonna be...

45:00.281 --> 45:01.691
Nicely done.

45:01.866 --> 45:03.402
Don't do that again.

45:09.624 --> 45:12.491
So, what's first?
Shooting range? Obstacle course?

45:12.668 --> 45:15.125
They don't let 9-year-olds
into shooting ranges.

45:15.296 --> 45:17.582
Where's the fun in that?

45:20.301 --> 45:21.837
Now, we know
you're a pretty good liar,

45:22.011 --> 45:24.172
but what if
you're caught by the enemy

45:24.347 --> 45:26.554
and faced with
3 lie detector test?

45:26.724 --> 45:29.386
Why are we doing this?
She shouldn't even be in here.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.516
Alright. The key is
to focus on your breathing.

45:31.687 --> 45:33.447
The slightest increase
in your blood pressure

45:33.481 --> 45:35.893
is an indicator that
you're not telling the truth.

45:36.067 --> 45:37.477
We'll start with
something simple.

45:37.652 --> 45:39.062
I'll ask you a question

45:39.237 --> 45:40.727
and you'll answer with
an obvious lie.

45:40.905 --> 45:43.396
I don't wanna see those needles
move. Is that clear?

45:43.574 --> 45:45.280
Alright. Here we go.

45:48.704 --> 45:50.786
Sophie: So, when do I get
my first assignment?

45:50.957 --> 45:52.663
Jj: When I decide
that you're ready.

45:52.833 --> 45:57.623
- I am ready.
- Oh, yeah? Alright.

45:57.797 --> 45:59.753
See that
apartment building there?

45:59.924 --> 46:00.924
Yeah.

46:00.967 --> 46:02.332
You know anybody
who lives there?

46:02.510 --> 46:04.626
- No.
- 10 minutes.

46:04.804 --> 46:06.510
I wanna see you on
one of those balconies.

46:06.681 --> 46:09.468
You want me to talk my way into
some stranger's apartment?

46:09.642 --> 46:11.178
Do you know how dangerous
that is?

46:11.352 --> 46:13.559
You didn't have a problem
walking into my apartment.

46:13.729 --> 46:16.562
I only need five minutes.

46:19.485 --> 46:21.476
What do you do for a living?

46:21.654 --> 46:25.272
I'm a kgb agent
posing as a fourth-grader.

46:25.449 --> 46:27.690
My brother has three legs
and sells crack

46:27.868 --> 46:29.233
and my mother is a prostitute.

46:32.581 --> 46:34.697
I don't need a machine
to tell me if someone's lying.

46:34.875 --> 46:38.459
Yeah? Yeah. I can smell a lie.

46:48.180 --> 46:51.217
Endorphins release an odour,
palms sweat

46:51.392 --> 46:54.884
and the ultimate tell -
the slightest blink of an eye.

46:55.062 --> 46:57.599
That's all I need.
You mean like this?

46:57.773 --> 47:01.106
Jj, I think you're a really
sweet and sensitive person.

47:02.653 --> 47:05.110
Jj, I admire
all of your tattoos.

47:05.281 --> 47:06.862
Stop.

47:07.033 --> 47:10.196
Jj, I believe you that
you've never taken steroids.

47:11.287 --> 47:12.902
Jesus Christ!

47:13.080 --> 47:16.914
Jj, stop. Seriously. For real.
I'm just joking.

47:28.137 --> 47:30.344
Now, in any fight,
you need an element of surprise.

47:30.514 --> 47:33.802
Now, you're tiny and weak
and I'm the opposite,

47:33.976 --> 47:38.094
so the objective of this
exercise is to get past me.

47:38.272 --> 47:40.479
Now, a good idea might be
to cause a distraction

47:40.649 --> 47:43.311
because, otherwise,
there'd be zero chance of you...

47:43.486 --> 47:45.898
Blueberry!

47:48.491 --> 47:50.402
Blueberry! Oh, god. Ok.

47:57.291 --> 47:59.031
That's some cold-blooded shit.

48:12.848 --> 48:14.910
So far, I could have learned
anything you've taught me

48:14.934 --> 48:16.299
from YouTube.

48:16.477 --> 48:18.342
Oh, yeah? Is that so?

48:18.521 --> 48:20.637
I mean, when are you gonna
teach me the fun stuff,

48:20.815 --> 48:23.978
like how to walk away from an
explosion without looking back

48:24.151 --> 48:26.642
or what cool line you say
before you take someone out?

48:26.821 --> 48:29.028
You need to stop getting
all your spy knowledge

48:29.198 --> 48:30.654
from "mission: Impossible'.

48:30.825 --> 48:32.361
But...

48:33.869 --> 48:35.530
If I was gonna say a cool line,

48:35.704 --> 48:37.194
I have to keep it real fresh.

48:37.373 --> 48:39.373
You'd have a different line
for different bad guys?

48:39.458 --> 48:40.743
Yep.

48:40.918 --> 48:44.456
What if the assassin was
disguised as an ice-cream man?

48:44.630 --> 48:47.838
I'd say, "chill out." And then
I'd stab him with a freezer pop.

48:48.008 --> 48:51.717
- A sidewalk Santa?
- "Jingle all the way... to hell."

48:51.887 --> 48:53.923
A guy dressed up as a dog,
selling watches?

48:54.098 --> 48:55.929
"Time's up, bitch."

49:24.587 --> 49:26.953
- How was your day?
- It was good. Yours?

49:29.091 --> 49:30.627
Fine.

49:32.011 --> 49:34.047
- Something wrong?
- No.

49:34.221 --> 49:35.586
Are you sure?

49:35.764 --> 49:38.005
'Cause it seems like something
might be bothering you.

49:38.184 --> 49:40.926
You helped train her how to pass
a lie detector, but not me.

49:41.103 --> 49:44.641
I mean, I don't wanna be ageist
here, jj, but she is nine.

49:44.815 --> 49:46.646
She still sleeps
with a night-light.

49:46.817 --> 49:50.355
I'm a professional hacker with
a master's degree in english.

49:50.529 --> 49:51.969
We just spent a little time
together.

49:52.072 --> 49:53.552
I wasn't really teaching her
anything.

49:53.699 --> 49:56.566
Oh, well, you taught her
how to place shaped charges.

49:56.744 --> 49:58.951
- It was just play-doh.
- That's not the point.

49:59.121 --> 50:01.561
- Should I get you some play-doh?
- I can get my own play-doh.

50:01.624 --> 50:03.740
Are you sure? Because
I'd be happy to get you some.

50:03.918 --> 50:05.437
Don't you make this about
the play-doh.

50:05.461 --> 50:07.326
This is about us.
We're partners.

50:07.505 --> 50:11.089
I already told you,
you are not my partner.

50:14.345 --> 50:16.176
Hey!

50:17.598 --> 50:19.259
Did you make dinner?

50:21.143 --> 50:23.475
Let me just hop right on that.

50:36.283 --> 50:39.150
Hello? Hello? Hello?

50:40.621 --> 50:42.327
Victor, what are you doing here?

50:42.498 --> 50:44.159
Relax.

50:44.333 --> 50:46.574
There's no signal
or surveillance

50:46.752 --> 50:48.367
that this will not jam.

50:48.546 --> 50:53.085
- What are you talking about?
- The CIA is all over you.

50:53.259 --> 50:55.362
They're gonna be coming through
that door in two minutes,

50:55.386 --> 50:57.968
which means you have exactly one
to give me what I need.

50:59.390 --> 51:01.096
Anything.

51:01.267 --> 51:02.632
Where did my brother
put the plans?

51:02.810 --> 51:04.175
I don't know.

51:08.899 --> 51:12.062
- I think you do.
- He didn't trust me.

51:12.236 --> 51:14.648
He didn't trust anyone,
especially you.

51:14.822 --> 51:18.360
All I heard him say was that
it was with his best friend.

51:20.411 --> 51:21.776
His best friend?

51:21.954 --> 51:25.412
Yes, but I don't know
who that is.

51:25.583 --> 51:26.948
I do.

51:31.171 --> 51:32.707
I gotta head out.

51:55.070 --> 51:57.686
Hey. Are you ok?
What's the emergency?

51:57.865 --> 51:59.776
We need to have 'the talk'.

51:59.950 --> 52:01.315
Excuse me?

52:01.493 --> 52:03.859
You got off on the wrong track
with my mom,

52:04.038 --> 52:06.996
but I see the real you
and I think this can still work.

52:07.166 --> 52:08.622
I've been doing some research.

52:08.792 --> 52:11.204
'Cosmo' online says
you should be masculine,

52:11.378 --> 52:14.370
but also sensitive
and emotionally vulnerable.

52:14.548 --> 52:17.665
Sophie, what's going on?
Did you lie to get me here?

52:17.843 --> 52:21.256
- Well...
- Jj, what are you doing here?

52:21.430 --> 52:24.263
Jj wanted to come to our art
show and see some of my work.

52:24.433 --> 52:28.517
Apparently, he loves art.
You do?

52:30.022 --> 52:33.185
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I mean...

52:33.359 --> 52:36.601
I mean, Sophie,
what you've done here...

52:38.614 --> 52:41.321
With the colour,
it's... it's amazing,

52:41.492 --> 52:44.108
and you can actually tell that
that's a bird.

52:46.914 --> 52:48.905
As opposed to
this piece of crap.

52:49.083 --> 52:50.744
I mean, what the hell is that?

52:50.918 --> 52:53.660
I mean, it looks like a hot dog
taking a dump on a cat.

52:53.837 --> 52:57.204
That is...
That is horrible, right?

52:57.383 --> 52:59.874
Right? That is so...

53:02.429 --> 53:04.169
Let me finish.

53:06.350 --> 53:08.966
I'm gonna run ahead, mom.
I've got homework to do.

53:09.144 --> 53:12.261
- Later, jj.
- See you, kid.

53:13.315 --> 53:16.273
Hey, I'm sorry for
what happened back there.

53:16.443 --> 53:18.684
I have a knack of putting
my foot in my mouth.

53:18.862 --> 53:21.194
Really? Hadn't noticed.

53:22.449 --> 53:23.814
You get used to being alone

53:23.992 --> 53:26.262
and, all of a sudden, you're not
good with people anymore.

53:26.286 --> 53:29.153
Yeah. I guess I know
a little bit about that too.

53:30.207 --> 53:32.207
But, you know, what is it
they say about parenting?

53:32.292 --> 53:33.873
It's not just about
what you say.

53:34.044 --> 53:37.127
It's about being there,
showing up.

53:38.716 --> 53:41.378
Sophie hasn't had that
for a while.

53:42.428 --> 53:45.010
Her dad passed away
about a year ago.

53:45.180 --> 53:48.843
She keeps pretending she's ok,
but I can tell she's struggling.

53:49.017 --> 53:51.804
No. She's tough like her mom.

53:51.979 --> 53:54.971
- I don't know how tough I am.
- L1 do, believe me.

53:55.149 --> 53:57.640
My balls still hurt.

53:57.818 --> 54:00.150
So sorry about that.

54:07.202 --> 54:09.067
Do you want to know a secret?

54:12.040 --> 54:13.701
Yeah, sure.

54:15.669 --> 54:18.331
I have no idea what I'm doing.

54:18.505 --> 54:20.791
I'm just winging it.

54:22.301 --> 54:23.791
Yeah. Me too.

54:23.969 --> 54:26.210
Oh, look at this little guy.

54:26.388 --> 54:28.299
Kate: Ooh.
Oh, I think he's sick.

54:28.474 --> 54:30.180
Jj: No, he just needs
a little help.

54:30.350 --> 54:31.715
There you go, little guy.

54:31.894 --> 54:34.180
You're gonna be just fine,
mi amigo.

54:34.354 --> 54:37.391
Alright. There you go,
safe and sound.

54:37.566 --> 54:39.272
Maybe you're right.

54:39.443 --> 54:42.025
Maybe me just being here,
showing up,

54:42.196 --> 54:43.561
was all that little guy needed.

54:45.282 --> 54:47.273
Oh!

54:47.451 --> 54:51.740
L... did not see that coming.

54:53.624 --> 54:56.331
Oh, man. Poor bird.

54:58.670 --> 55:00.376
- I had a thought.
- Yeah?

55:00.547 --> 55:04.506
I happen to have
Thursday night off from work

55:04.676 --> 55:08.794
and I wondered if you might
wanna grab a bite.

55:11.099 --> 55:13.681
I promise not to cook.

55:14.812 --> 55:16.052
Um...

55:17.523 --> 55:19.059
Yeah.

55:19.233 --> 55:22.725
- Ok. Great.
- Yeah, that'd be great.

55:22.903 --> 55:24.985
- See you later.
- Alright.

55:25.155 --> 55:27.066
Kate: Have a good night.

55:31.912 --> 55:33.994
- Jj!
- Hey.

55:34.164 --> 55:36.280
What the heck happened?

55:36.458 --> 55:39.916
- How did you turn that around?
- You were listening?

55:40.963 --> 55:42.294
Honestly, I have no idea.

55:42.464 --> 55:45.672
Not what I expected,
but you can't blow this now.

55:45.843 --> 55:47.925
Restaurant ideas?

55:48.095 --> 55:50.302
I jogged by this tapas bar
that has dancing.

55:50.472 --> 55:52.463
Dancing? Show me something.

55:52.641 --> 55:57.305
Floss? Dab? Crunk? Level up?
Anything?

55:57.479 --> 55:59.344
No. “We've come too far.

55:59.523 --> 56:01.479
I am not letting you ruin this.

56:07.239 --> 56:09.070
Ok. Stop. No.

56:09.241 --> 56:10.697
Are you having a stroke?

56:10.868 --> 56:13.575
- It's not that bad.
- Promise me one thing.

56:13.745 --> 56:16.657
I will let you take my mom
to dinner, but no dancing.

56:16.832 --> 56:19.164
Don't risk it. We good?

56:19.334 --> 56:20.995
You're very insensitive.

56:21.169 --> 56:24.627
- Are... we... good?
- Yeah, we're good.

56:24.798 --> 56:27.335
Good. Goodnight, jj.

56:27.509 --> 56:30.342
'Night, Sophie.
Thanks for the confidence boost.

56:30.512 --> 56:32.218
You're welcome.

56:43.317 --> 56:46.775
- What was the emergency?
- Uh, nothing, really.

56:46.945 --> 56:50.779
Hm. Weird.
Anything I should know about?

56:50.949 --> 56:54.316
- No.
- Ok.

56:56.246 --> 56:57.765
Kate on video:
..Was wondering if maybe

56:57.789 --> 57:00.405
you would like
fo grab a bite with me.

57:00.584 --> 57:02.245
Jj on video: Yeah.

57:02.419 --> 57:05.286
Are you kidding me?
What the hell are you thinking?

57:05.464 --> 57:07.955
I wasn't thinking. It was this
adrenaline-charged moment.

57:08.133 --> 57:12.172
Her eyes were amazing.
You are off the rails!

57:12.346 --> 57:15.258
First, you take the kid skating,
then you go to show-and-tell,

57:15.432 --> 57:16.797
and now you're going on a date

57:16.975 --> 57:18.815
with the woman
we're supposed to be surveilling

57:18.977 --> 57:20.717
and you're lying to me about it.

57:20.896 --> 57:22.386
If I'm with her,
I'll know she's safe.

57:22.564 --> 57:25.226
Well, dude, our job
isn't to keep her safe, ok?

57:25.400 --> 57:27.516
It's to see if the bad guy
makes contact with her.

57:27.694 --> 57:29.810
- That is our mission.
- There is no mission.

57:29.988 --> 57:31.944
This is all nonsense.

57:32.115 --> 57:34.276
There is no covert information
in that apartment,

57:34.451 --> 57:36.988
just a broken family
and that is the truth.

57:37.162 --> 57:41.826
The truth? We're gonna talk
about the truth, finally? Great!

57:42.000 --> 57:44.207
Well, I know that
you lost your entire team

57:44.378 --> 57:45.959
on your last deployment.

57:47.047 --> 57:48.412
That's classified.

57:48.590 --> 57:51.377
Yeah.
Well, I'm the tech, remember?

57:51.551 --> 57:53.382
I can work around that -

57:53.553 --> 57:55.965
something you might find useful
if you'd ever trust me,

57:56.139 --> 57:57.754
but I get it.

57:57.933 --> 58:01.551
You're the guy who's all closed
off, huh? "Ll work alone."

58:01.728 --> 58:03.138
You're on thin ice.

58:03.313 --> 58:05.144
Maybe you should
take Kate out to dinner

58:05.315 --> 58:07.431
so you can get over
all that crap in your past

58:07.609 --> 58:09.099
and see if
you still have a heart

58:09.277 --> 58:10.642
underneath that tattooed forest.

58:10.821 --> 58:15.155
- Fine. I will.
- Great! Have a great dinner!

58:17.703 --> 58:20.410
Well, that's not how
I intended that to go.

58:32.926 --> 58:34.791
Hey, jj! Got a sec?

58:34.970 --> 58:36.585
Uh, got a date.

58:36.763 --> 58:40.005
Yeah, we heard from Sophie.
She sent us the sos.

58:40.183 --> 58:42.048
Ooh. Shit's out of style.

58:42.227 --> 58:43.763
Ain't that right, Todd?

58:46.565 --> 58:48.055
Carlos: Come on.

58:48.233 --> 58:50.519
Come on, we're not gonna
bite you. Come on.

58:55.157 --> 58:57.648
Kate's a very special lady.
Don't you agree?

58:57.826 --> 59:00.112
- Definitely.
- Beautiful.

59:00.287 --> 59:02.073
- Smart.
- Been through a lot, though.

59:02.247 --> 59:04.488
Vulnerable, single mom.

59:04.666 --> 59:07.032
Todd wants to know
what your intentions are.

59:07.210 --> 59:09.451
We're just going out to dinner.

59:09.629 --> 59:11.494
Todd was raised
by a single mother.

59:11.673 --> 59:15.791
- The situation concerns him.
- Well, just dinner, Todd.

59:15.969 --> 59:18.711
And this is just a friendly chat
between neighbours.

59:18.889 --> 59:22.222
Let's not keep up
this cha... rade, jj.

59:22.392 --> 59:24.223
We know how men think, ok?

59:24.394 --> 59:29.229
No. Guys, I'll treat her well.
I promise. You can trust me.

59:31.526 --> 59:34.893
Alright.
How much time do we have?

59:35.072 --> 59:37.563
I guess I can be a little late.
10 minutes?

59:37.741 --> 59:40.904
10 minutes?! I'm not god.
This will never work.

59:41.078 --> 59:43.034
Just cancel
and reschedule for may.

59:43.205 --> 59:45.412
- Mm...
- Ok.

59:45.582 --> 59:47.493
Todd's right. We can do this.

59:47.667 --> 59:49.953
First, we gotta do something
about this shirt.

59:50.128 --> 59:51.968
You look like you're
advertising brawny towels.

59:52.047 --> 59:53.583
Who are you,
the quicker picker upper?

59:53.757 --> 59:56.214
Then we have to exfoliate.

59:56.384 --> 59:59.171
I don't know what that means.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.466
You guys are starting
to freak me out.

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:17.102
So, Sophie tells me you guys
just moved back from Paris.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.986
Kate: Mm-hm.

01:00:19.157 --> 01:00:20.613
Yeah. Um...

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:22.320
Yeah, when...
When her dad passed,

01:00:22.494 --> 01:00:24.985
we stayed for a bit,
but it was hard.

01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:29.247
Last year, the police raided
our house and took everything,

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:31.829
froze our accounts,
seized our assets.

01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:36.463
Turned out that my husband was
involved in some very bad stuff

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:40.546
and, um, I didn't know.

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:44.796
Yeah, it's...

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:47.762
It's scary what some people
can keep secret.

01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:51.057
Ah, we meet again.

01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:53.347
Where are we at?

01:00:53.525 --> 01:00:55.686
Been together an hour 20.

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:58.523
Seems to be going well,
smiles on both sides.

01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:00.062
Solid fashion choice.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.356
He looks handsome.
“What's with the shirt?

01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:04.525
He got queer-eyed
by Todd and Carlos.

01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:06.819
Sweet. Do you want audio?

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:09.534
- Do you have audio?
- What am I, like, nine?

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:11.198
No offence.

01:01:11.376 --> 01:01:13.833
Kate: Just so nice
fo be out with the grown-ups.

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:15.524
Sophie, if you ever
wanna share with me

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:18.038
what jj taught you,
that'd be cool, but...

01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:19.626
Ah, never mind.

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:21.917
Sure, I could teach you

01:01:22.095 --> 01:01:23.960
if you teach me
how to tap a phone.

01:01:25.557 --> 01:01:27.422
Kate: So, what about you?

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:31.810
What twist of fate brought you
across the hallway from us?

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:35.889
Kate, there's something...

01:01:36.067 --> 01:01:37.507
There's something
I need to tell you.

01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:40.023
Do you want to dance?

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:44.106
Because I haven't danced
in ages.

01:01:45.994 --> 01:01:48.201
Correct. Don't think.
You should not.

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:50.362
Are you afraid?

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:55.872
- Oh, god.
- Let's do it.

01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:57.502
- Kate: Yes!
- Let's do it.

01:01:57.672 --> 01:02:02.086
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes!

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.841
Alright, here we go.

01:02:04.012 --> 01:02:07.129
Cardi b raps: J hotter than
a Somali fur coat, Ferrari

01:02:07.307 --> 01:02:09.013
j hop out the stu',
jump in the coupe

01:02:09.184 --> 01:02:10.674
j big Dipper on top of the roof

01:02:10.852 --> 01:02:12.843
j flexing on bitches

01:02:13.021 --> 01:02:14.557
wait. Wait.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:16.811
- Man: Hey, watch it!
- Jj: Sorry, man. I'm so sorry.

01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:20.354
Mm...

01:02:20.528 --> 01:02:22.109
J run this shit like cardio

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.816

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:27.653
oh, no. It's happening.

01:02:29.704 --> 01:02:31.569
He's going to wind up
on the 'today' show.

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:37.204
This looks like the wedding
at the end of 'Shrek'.

01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:49.179
I had a lot of fun tonight.

01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:50.964
Yeah, me too.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.511
- Well, goodnight.
- 'Night.

01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:08.572
Well, math story problems
can be tricky,

01:03:08.743 --> 01:03:10.358
so you gotta break 'em down.

01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:12.744
First, figure out
what they're asking you

01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:14.279
and then you do the math.

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:18.325
- How'd you get that scar?
- That? Shrapnel.

01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:20.209
Check this one.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.745
Scooter.

01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:24.289
Solid. Now concentrate, ok?

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:37.135
Was my dad a bad guy?

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:40.138
Um...

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:42.979
Yes. Yeah.

01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:48.564
Uh, well, I think...

01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:50.733
I think he made
some bad decisions,

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:54.494
especially about getting
involved with your uncle,

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:58.248
but if he helped make you,

01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:00.124
he couldn't have been
all that bad, right?

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:07.670
Alright. Math.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:11.302
Let's say there's 12 really bad
guys and I gotta take them down,

01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:12.838
but I've got a partner.

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:16.554
If you divide a dozen bad guys
by the two of us,

01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:19.310
how many bad guys do each of us
get to take down?

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:23.224
Sophie:
Well, 12 divided by 2 is 6,

01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:25.733
but if your partner is Bobbi,

01:04:25.904 --> 01:04:27.735
you're taking down all 12

01:04:27.906 --> 01:04:29.442
and she's cheering you on
from the Van.

01:04:31.576 --> 01:04:35.410
Oh, but, wait, then seven more
bad guys surround your compound

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.070
and you don't know
which way to go

01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:39.409
because your tech support
hates you and drove away,

01:04:39.584 --> 01:04:40.949
so, oops, you're dead.

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:45.958
- Hi, Kate.
- Hey. Can I ask a favour?

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:49.374
- Jj over phone: Um, yeah, ok.
- They just extended my shift.

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:51.884
Can you look in on Sophie?

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:55.718
I mean, I'm sure she'll be fine,
but it's a long time alone.

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:57.257
Jj over phone: Yeah, no problem.

01:04:57.435 --> 01:04:58.800
Thanks. You're a lifesaver.

01:04:58.978 --> 01:05:01.310
Oh, can you make sure
she does her homework?

01:05:01.481 --> 01:05:03.472
You got it.

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:35.212
Hi, mom.

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:36.909
We finished homework,
so we made dinner.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:39.015
- Yeah.
- What are we having?

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:41.767
Well, I can't cook,
so protein shakes.

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:44.270
- And grilled cheese sandwiches.
- That's right.

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:48.312
I got that.

01:05:51.239 --> 01:05:52.729
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:05:52.907 --> 01:05:54.443
Yeah.

01:05:55.994 --> 01:05:58.701
I know I should have called
before I stayed.

01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:01.705
I didn't expect
to walk into this.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:03.991
I'm sorry.
Sophie can be really convincing.

01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:06.160
No, you're not in trouble.

01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:08.248
I just...
I wanted to say thank you.

01:06:08.423 --> 01:06:10.459
Aww!

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:14.876
You stumbling into our lives
has been a breath of fresh air.

01:06:15.054 --> 01:06:17.761
Sophie: Mom, where does this go?

01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:23.180
I'll be back.

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:35.692
Oh, yeah, he's toast.

01:06:39.078 --> 01:06:40.443
Where are my plans?

01:06:40.622 --> 01:06:42.158
The clock is ticking.

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:44.288
Azar, you worry too much.

01:06:44.459 --> 01:06:47.451
I've located them,
but I'm gonna need 24 hours.

01:06:47.629 --> 01:06:50.587
Let's go inside.
There are eyes all around us.

01:06:58.139 --> 01:07:00.175
I think Marquez has found
what he's looking for.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:01.715
Move in. Now!

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:40.754
- Christina: Freeze!
- Don't move!

01:07:40.932 --> 01:07:43.719
Get in.

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:49.930
Go!

01:07:50.108 --> 01:07:52.645
We've got them pinned.
I want both teams...

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:22.303
- Must be pretty important.
- Kim: Oh, it is.

01:08:22.473 --> 01:08:24.759
That's why I wanted
to do it here.

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:26.970
- The operation is over.
- Bobbil: What?

01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:29.261
We closed in on Marquez
in Berlin.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:32.180
So rather than be taken,
he blew himself up.

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:34.019
There are multiple bodies.

01:08:34.193 --> 01:08:35.587
Forensics are sifting
through the mess.

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:37.273
Kim: So the mission's over

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:40.154
and we no longer need to be
watching the family.

01:08:40.325 --> 01:08:44.193
Ok, so I guess we'll go back
to Chicago and clear out?

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:45.951
You'll be doing more than that.

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:48.363
You'll also be clearing out
your desks here.

01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:56.082
Oh, man. You tapped into
our hard drive.

01:08:56.256 --> 01:08:57.997
Uh... that's kinda what we do.

01:08:58.176 --> 01:09:00.006
That is not what it looks like.

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:03.051
That... I can explain that.

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:04.629
J they call me cardi b

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:06.889
j I run this shit
like cardio... j

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:11.053
1 million hits? Wow, that's...

01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:12.515
Not the point.

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:14.430
Just one job.

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:18.227
Just one job. To sit and watch.

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:20.234
But no, you compromised
a mission

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:22.112
and broke protocol.

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:24.303
- That can't be tolerated!
- This wasn't Bobbi's fault.

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:26.533
- I took this...
- You guys are done.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.741
Wow, I'm... I just...

01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:32.247
And you couldn't just call us
in Chicago and tell us that

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:33.783
so we could clear out there?

01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:36.077
You had to fly us out here
to tell us that?

01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:37.620
That's very expensive.

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:39.380
Is email not working?

01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:41.791
These are tax dollars.

01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:48.594
Bobbi, when are you
gonna say something?

01:09:48.768 --> 01:09:50.554
I mean, the whole flight back,
nothing.

01:09:50.728 --> 01:09:53.640
You know?
Alright, fine, I was wrong.

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:55.601
I didn't listen. You warned me.

01:09:55.775 --> 01:09:59.313
You know, say something.
Why aren't you mad at me?

01:10:01.823 --> 01:10:03.905
'Cause you're my hero, dude.

01:10:04.075 --> 01:10:07.488
I liked watching you become
a normal person.

01:10:11.124 --> 01:10:12.489
Good luck.

01:10:24.846 --> 01:10:27.883
- Hey! Hi, come on in.
- Hey. Alright.

01:10:29.809 --> 01:10:31.174
So, where have you been?

01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:32.808
Uh, yeah, I, uh...

01:10:32.979 --> 01:10:35.311
I got some hopefully good news.

01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:39.065
And some... some
potentially upsetting news.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:41.317
- Oh.
- First the good news.

01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:42.818
Ok.

01:10:42.989 --> 01:10:44.695
Kate...

01:10:44.866 --> 01:10:48.154
I really like you. A lot.

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:51.910
You've opened up a part of me
that's been

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:54.197
closed off for
a really long time.

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:57.993
Well, let's just say
the feeling's mutual.

01:11:00.965 --> 01:11:05.425
Um, the... potentially upsetting
news?

01:11:15.396 --> 01:11:16.761
Bobbi: Oh, boy.

01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:25.686
We're CIA.

01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:27.821
I'm so sorry.

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:38.449
Kate...

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:41.119
- How stupid.
- Jj: Kate...

01:11:42.215 --> 01:11:43.796
Kate.

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:46.207
- Where are they?
- Kate...

01:11:55.937 --> 01:11:57.473
(God!

01:11:57.647 --> 01:12:01.265
You're good, jj.
You are really good!

01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:04.559
With all your... your stories.

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:06.022
And Sophie!

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:08.521
I was trying to protect you.

01:12:08.699 --> 01:12:10.235
Jj?

01:12:10.409 --> 01:12:11.990
Sophie, go to your room.

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:13.161
- Please.
- Wait, mom.

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:15.448
Don't be mad. I can explain.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:17.993
You knew about this?

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.786
Sophie...

01:12:25.758 --> 01:12:27.373
How could you?!

01:12:28.886 --> 01:12:30.217
It's my job, Kate.

01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:33.546
I eave.

01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:43.355
Sophie...

01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:49.107
Song: J I'm on the road
to getting better... j&

01:12:49.282 --> 01:12:51.398
what have I done?

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.525
You were right this whole time.

01:12:54.704 --> 01:12:56.114
Bobbi: Oh, I was.

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:58.154
I let it get personal.

01:12:58.332 --> 01:13:00.072
With the kid and Kate.

01:13:00.251 --> 01:13:01.866
I was weak.

01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:04.660
I mean, personal
isn't a weakness.

01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:07.626
In your case,
it ruined your career

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.586
and threatened
national security,

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.968
but most people do have
personal relationships.

01:13:13.139 --> 01:13:14.379
Not me.

01:13:14.557 --> 01:13:16.422
I have a fish.

01:13:20.021 --> 01:13:21.386
How's he doing?

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:23.646
Not so good.

01:13:24.692 --> 01:13:26.545
I'm also just a girl...

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:28.855
Standing in front of a boy...

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:31.897
Asking him to love her.

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:34.565
It's the saddest movie ever.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:39.450
I used walking ozzie as a decoy
to get to see you.

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:42.282
That was smart.

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.041
You shouldn't be here.

01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:49.126
I made this for you.

01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:52.717
It's not a fish,
so it won't die on you.

01:13:52.887 --> 01:13:55.048
You can keep it forever.

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:01.892
Come on. Let me walk you back.

01:14:15.076 --> 01:14:17.408
We're not going to see
each other again,

01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:19.409
are we?

01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:25.449
I'll, uh...

01:14:27.546 --> 01:14:29.912
I'll check on you
from time to time, ok?

01:14:35.012 --> 01:14:38.630
I'm never gonna forget you, ok?
Promise.

01:14:57.827 --> 01:15:01.319
Mom? Mom, are you ok?
What happened?

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:03.078
Sophie, go play.

01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:16.963
Whoa! Holy crap!

01:15:26.272 --> 01:15:28.012
Isn't this cute?

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:31.057
Little Sophie has a new
play date from the CIA.

01:15:31.235 --> 01:15:32.645
Sit down.

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:38.023
Why don't you just go, Victor?
Please, just leave.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.033
The CIA is watching us. They're
gonna be here any minute.

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:43.785
No, I took care of that
with some explosives

01:15:43.956 --> 01:15:45.696
and an old building
with a tunnel system

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:47.490
left over from world war il.

01:15:47.668 --> 01:15:49.750
Good boy.

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.411
It's not gonna hold forever,
but...

01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:54.421
I only need a day.

01:15:54.592 --> 01:15:57.004
Don't hurt him! This little guy?

01:15:57.178 --> 01:15:59.715
I would never hurt him.

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:02.756
He means more to me
than any of you do.

01:16:04.351 --> 01:16:06.433
He's my brother's best friend.

01:16:12.526 --> 01:16:14.016
Hey!

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:17.895
Oh, my god. What do I do?

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:28.493
Oh, I'm gonna touch!

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:51.516
Ahh!

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:54.557
Great, teach the kid.
No need to show me anything.

01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:01.814
It's all there.

01:17:01.992 --> 01:17:03.948
Carlos: Hello, family!

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:06.236
Door was open.
Todd made his famous hummus.

01:17:06.413 --> 01:17:08.653
- No, you guys need to leave.
- Yeah, I have family over.

01:17:08.749 --> 01:17:10.114
Y'all are being extremely rude.

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:12.292
You know how hard it is
making hummus from scratch?

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:13.576
I eave now.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:18.088
Ok, that's it. Now you've hurt
Todd's feelings. Todd?

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:27.093
I can't believe this.

01:17:27.268 --> 01:17:28.508
How'd you guys know?

01:17:28.686 --> 01:17:30.642
We'll take that, jj.

01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:33.896
I'd prefer not to put holes in
a pretty thing like you.

01:17:34.066 --> 01:17:35.852
Ok, I'm confused.
You're in on this?

01:17:36.026 --> 01:17:37.391
Is there anyone in this building

01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:38.935
who's not lying
about who they are?

01:17:39.113 --> 01:17:40.593
Carlos: We're independent
contractors.

01:17:40.739 --> 01:17:43.135
When the plans didn't hit the
market after your husband died,

01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:44.524
we figured they must be here.

01:17:44.702 --> 01:17:46.317
We decided to play
the long game.

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:48.907
No-one ever suspects
the gay couple next door.

01:17:49.081 --> 01:17:50.867
Sorry, you're lying about
being gay too?!

01:17:51.041 --> 01:17:52.406
Oh, no, we're gay.

01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:54.345
We fell in love through
this mission, though.

01:17:54.378 --> 01:17:55.743
It's really a cute story.

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:57.411
We found out we both
have a passion

01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:59.251
for ceviche
and long-range missiles.

01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:03.292
Oh, and you were good too.

01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:07.008
We expected CIA surveillance
but it never occurred to us

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:09.799
that someone would actually
get involved with their target.

01:18:09.977 --> 01:18:13.469
But enough of that.
The drive, jj.

01:18:22.489 --> 01:18:24.605
It's nothing personal, honey.
We're still friends.

01:18:34.627 --> 01:18:36.618
Wow.

01:18:42.009 --> 01:18:43.249
Ozzie!

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:46.544
- Sophie: Jj!
- Kate: No!

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:47.928
No!

01:18:48.098 --> 01:18:50.464
I'm on Marquez!

01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:52.133
Freeze!

01:18:52.311 --> 01:18:56.680
I will shoot you right in your
beautifully botoxed face.

01:18:56.857 --> 01:18:59.519
We both know you don't have what
it takes to pull that trigger.

01:18:59.693 --> 01:19:01.900
Oh, bitch, you don't know me.

01:19:06.659 --> 01:19:08.900
You're not very good at
the gun thing, buttercup.

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:10.943
Maybe.

01:19:11.121 --> 01:19:13.863
But you know
what I'm really good at?

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:16.745
Kicking...

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:20.415
Um...

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:22.454
Uh, kicking...

01:19:22.633 --> 01:19:24.999
Let me go! Let me go!

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:29.006
Jd! Jj!

01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:31.384
Dss.

01:19:58.127 --> 01:19:59.207
Get in!

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:12.262
Uncle Victor,
why are you doing this?

01:20:12.433 --> 01:20:14.344
You're my insurance.
And don't call me 'uncle'.

01:20:14.518 --> 01:20:16.718
Your father and I hated
each other. I'm not your family.

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:18.222
I wanna go home. Take me back.

01:20:18.397 --> 01:20:21.104
Shut up! Not another word.

01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:34.368
Bobbi, you there?
Can you get eyes on?

01:20:34.538 --> 01:20:36.745
Yeah! Yeah, I just gotta
get a lock on the satellite.

01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:38.280
It'll just take a minute.

01:20:38.459 --> 01:20:40.916
I have her on find my iPhone.
Going west on 88th.

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:46.796
Jj: May I suggest keeping
your eyes on the road?

01:20:46.967 --> 01:20:49.504
- Or sidewalk!
- Man: Hey, you crazy...

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:07.693
- What the hell is on that drive?
- Nuclear, end-of-world stuff.

01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:09.774
It's still not a good reason
for lying to me!

01:21:09.948 --> 01:21:12.690
Totally right.
Not a good reason.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.360
Bobbi: I got you on satellite.

01:21:16.538 --> 01:21:18.058
Looks like they're headed
to naperville.

01:21:18.082 --> 01:21:19.913
- There's an airfield there.
- On it.

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:25.285
In a quarter of a mile,
turn left.

01:21:25.464 --> 01:21:26.829
Are you using waze?!

01:21:27.007 --> 01:21:29.339
Yes! Your driving's
frightening me.

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:48.517
Let me go!

01:21:54.034 --> 01:21:55.444
Don't move.

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:10.171
- Kate, I wouldn't.
- Hold on!

01:22:13.887 --> 01:22:15.627
You have reached
your destination.

01:22:15.806 --> 01:22:17.637
Whoa. Not what I expected.

01:22:17.808 --> 01:22:20.424
Actually, I...
I didn't expect that either.

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:23.184
Kate: Don't let him
leave with her!

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:36.740
What are you gonna do?

01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:38.070
I'm working on it!

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:14.403
Who builds a runway
at the edge of a cliff?!

01:23:26.418 --> 01:23:28.955
You messed with the wrong dude.

01:23:29.129 --> 01:23:30.915
We'll see about that.

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:36.751
Don't worry, Sophie.
He ain't getting by me.

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:18.000
You're starting to piss me off.

01:24:18.178 --> 01:24:21.136
I shoot this fuel
and everybody dies.

01:24:21.306 --> 01:24:23.547
Then let's make this quick.

01:24:46.665 --> 01:24:48.747
Is it just me
or does this seem familiar?

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:50.407
I'm a little busy right now!

01:24:50.586 --> 01:24:52.827
No, I mean, the propeller
and the fuel tank.

01:24:53.005 --> 01:24:54.996
It's like all we're missing
is Nazis.

01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:57.209
Stop talking!

01:25:12.024 --> 01:25:13.389
No! No!

01:25:13.567 --> 01:25:15.523
Jj!

01:25:36.673 --> 01:25:38.038
Sophie!

01:25:38.216 --> 01:25:40.628
Do not move!

01:25:44.598 --> 01:25:46.839
Jj, I'm scared!

01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:54.187
Don't look down!

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:58.191
Just look at me.

01:26:06.078 --> 01:26:07.568
Sophie.

01:26:07.746 --> 01:26:09.987
We need to balance out the plane
or it's gonna fall.

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:12.998
- What?
- I need you go to out the front.

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:16.251
I'm gonna go out the back
and meet you on the wing, ok?

01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:20.039
Just move slow
and don't look down.

01:26:20.217 --> 01:26:22.253
You can do it, ok?

01:26:22.427 --> 01:26:23.712
Ok.

01:26:37.401 --> 01:26:38.937
Ahh!

01:26:45.826 --> 01:26:47.362
Stop!

01:26:48.787 --> 01:26:50.323
Victor: Sophie, I'll take that.

01:26:50.497 --> 01:26:52.704
Sophie, don't do it.

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:53.874
Sweetheart,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.707
you just throw it to me
and I promise

01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:58.869
that I'll let you and
your new friend live.

01:27:01.675 --> 01:27:04.041
Sophie, no.

01:27:10.851 --> 01:27:12.933
Let him have it.

01:27:18.942 --> 01:27:20.853
Good girl.

01:27:21.027 --> 01:27:23.109
But I lied.

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.770
Guess that runs in the family.

01:27:24.948 --> 01:27:27.280
Not on my side.

01:27:33.957 --> 01:27:36.915
Have a nice flight, dick.

01:27:40.672 --> 01:27:43.004
"Have a nice flight, dick"?

01:27:43.175 --> 01:27:45.962
Give me a break. I was nervous.

01:27:49.306 --> 01:27:51.092
Not bad, kid.

01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:52.506
Jj, it's gonna blow.

01:27:52.684 --> 01:27:54.265
Go, go. Go!

01:27:56.813 --> 01:27:58.223
Jj, wait!

01:28:02.152 --> 01:28:03.767
Sophie!

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:05.560
Please.

01:28:23.673 --> 01:28:25.334
What are you guys doing?!

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:28.295
It's a dud.

01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:30.586
Where's the fun in that?

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:34.382
That's ok. Thanks.

01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:43.811
Don't tell anyone I did this.

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:46.818
What the hell? You just
walk around with that thing?

01:29:15.892 --> 01:29:18.258
Kim: Alright, guys.

01:29:18.436 --> 01:29:21.223
Seriously, seriously. Put a pin
in the applause. Knock it off.

01:29:21.398 --> 01:29:25.812
Well, we're facing a lot of
exposure over how this went down

01:29:25.986 --> 01:29:29.649
but you should know the family
really went to bat for you.

01:29:29.823 --> 01:29:31.423
Christina: Way to pull it
outta the fire.

01:29:31.533 --> 01:29:32.773
Thanks.

01:29:32.951 --> 01:29:37.160
So we've been giving it
a lot of thought, and, um...

01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:39.321
We'd like you back. Yes!

01:29:39.499 --> 01:29:42.081
And I'm giving you your pick of
assignments. Wherever you want.

01:29:42.252 --> 01:29:44.709
Well, I was thinking about
not travelling for a bit.

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.587
- Keep it domestic?
- Somewhere in Chicago, maybe?

01:29:47.757 --> 01:29:49.167
Maybe.

01:29:49.342 --> 01:29:51.503
But I gotta clear it
with my partner.

01:29:52.929 --> 01:29:55.215
Really? Yeah. Chicago?

01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:56.755
Yeah! Yeah.

01:29:56.933 --> 01:29:59.470
Um... wow!

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.806
I'd like to be back in the Van,
actually.

01:30:02.981 --> 01:30:05.222
- No more guns.
- No.

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.140
And if we're really partners,

01:30:07.319 --> 01:30:09.731
then I should get
equal pay with jj.

01:30:09.905 --> 01:30:11.896
Yeah, me too.

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:13.904
- Equal pay.
- Mm-hm.

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:15.736
Um...

01:30:15.911 --> 01:30:18.698
I'm gonna have to talk to
someone upstairs about that.

01:30:18.872 --> 01:30:21.158
There is no upstairs.
We are on the top floor.

01:30:27.923 --> 01:30:30.084
- Sophie: Looking good, jj.
- Jj: Thank you, honey.

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:32.624
Kate: I'd have to agree.

01:30:32.802 --> 01:30:34.338
Sophie: Eww! No!

01:30:34.512 --> 01:30:37.675
Oh! Uh, Sophie,
we're gonna play tag. Come on!

01:30:37.849 --> 01:30:39.214
Be right there.

01:30:39.392 --> 01:30:41.178
Being popular can be
a real time suck.

01:30:41.353 --> 01:30:42.638
Jj: Have fun, kid.

01:30:44.981 --> 01:30:47.597
