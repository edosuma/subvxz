I have cancer.

undergo brain surgery,
which is really scary.

I don't want you here.

DR. ANDREWS:
A surgeon needs
to communicate.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.590
Can Dr. Murphy do that?
Can he do that under stress?

00:22.656 --> 00:24.192
Can he do that

00:24.258 --> 00:26.427
knowing that a human life
literally hangs
in the balance?

DR. GLASSMAN: If Shaun proves
anything less than excellent,

I will resign my position
as president of this hospital.

has DIC.

I have to tell Dr. Andrews
about the mistake I made.

Shaun, you can't.

Shaun.

You've exceeded
my expectations

01:34.895 --> 01:38.132
in terms of expertise
and technical execution.

01:38.199 --> 01:41.135
But your communication skills
are sorely lacking.

if you want to stay here
at St. Bonaventure.

I exceeded expectations.

Dr. Andrews
could have some wisdom

by the fact that we're here.

I connected nicely,

about people.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.554
Interesting.

he'd want you to be
more aggressive.

more assertive, Dr. Browne.

Harry's tumor
