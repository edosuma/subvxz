00:04.211 --> 00:06.661
- [Announcer] On behalf of
the motion picture industry,

00:06.696 --> 00:09.630
welcome to the world of
home video entertainment.

00:10.734 --> 00:13.392
[reel rattling]

00:25.956 --> 00:29.339
[dark synthesizer music]

00:49.152 --> 00:51.189
- [Narrator] A video
nasty is a colloquial term

00:51.223 --> 00:53.743
used in the United
Kingdom and Europe

00:53.777 --> 00:56.918
to describe a number of
films which are distributed

00:56.953 --> 01:00.922
on VHS video in the early
1980s, which were heavily

01:00.957 --> 01:03.684
criticized by the
press, Parliament

01:03.718 --> 01:06.135
and various religious
organizations

01:06.169 --> 01:07.860
for their content
which contained

01:07.895 --> 01:10.622
strong use of violence
and graphic nudity.

01:10.656 --> 01:15.144
No legislation was in place to
regulate home video content.

01:15.178 --> 01:17.663
This meant that any
films on the market

01:17.698 --> 01:21.529
and available for video rental
stores had no certification.

01:21.564 --> 01:24.360
Although the act did not
govern home video at the time,

01:24.394 --> 01:27.190
at this time the British
Board of Film Censorship

01:27.225 --> 01:30.849
was established in 1912
only governed theatrical

01:30.883 --> 01:32.920
cinematic releases and was not

01:32.954 --> 01:35.060
enforced to censor home video.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.855
This is due to a loophole within

01:36.889 --> 01:39.271
the film classification
laws at the time.

01:39.306 --> 01:41.722
Because of this,
in the early 1980s,

01:41.756 --> 01:44.794
the market was flooded with
low budget horror films

01:44.828 --> 01:47.728
featuring gore, violence
and graphic nudity.

01:47.762 --> 01:50.627
Due to the video nasty
debate in both Parliament

01:50.662 --> 01:53.458
and in the courts, this
resulted in a number of films

01:53.492 --> 01:55.598
being prosecuted
in the early 80s

01:55.632 --> 01:58.152
by the director of
public prosecutions.

01:58.187 --> 01:59.740
Following this, the
government passed

01:59.774 --> 02:02.329
the Video Recordings Act 1984,

02:02.363 --> 02:04.952
which meant in Britain
all video releases

02:04.986 --> 02:06.954
had to appear before the BBFC.

02:06.988 --> 02:09.267
The so-called video
nasties caused

02:09.301 --> 02:13.167
an outright media frenzy
during the early 1980s.

02:13.202 --> 02:16.688
- [Announcer] To avoid
fainting, keep repeating, it's--

02:16.722 --> 02:21.382
- [Crowd] Only a movie,
only a movie, only a movie.

02:21.417 --> 02:24.074
- [Narrator] In 1982, Vidco
placed an advertisement

02:24.109 --> 02:26.905
for the Driller Killer
in a VHS magazine.

02:26.939 --> 02:29.390
This advertisement served
to bring the awareness

02:29.425 --> 02:32.807
of these types of films to
the attention of the masses.

02:32.842 --> 02:34.361
What happens next was--

02:34.395 --> 02:37.364
- Censorship, censorship.

02:37.398 --> 02:38.606
- [Announcer] Cannibalism.

02:42.023 --> 02:43.784
- Censorship.

02:43.818 --> 02:45.268
- I think it's important
for us to define

02:45.303 --> 02:46.890
what we're talking
about here at the start.

02:46.925 --> 02:49.030
This isn't the small
type of censorship,

02:49.065 --> 02:51.585
say an adult trying to restrict
the access of a small child

02:51.619 --> 02:53.863
to pornography,
something you could argue

02:53.897 --> 02:56.866
is in the best interest of
someone who is not capable

02:56.900 --> 02:59.696
of deciding for themselves
what's best for them

02:59.731 --> 03:01.733
or what is possibly
bad for them.

03:01.767 --> 03:02.699
This is something different.

03:02.734 --> 03:04.494
This is something larger.

03:04.529 --> 03:05.461
This is something insidious.

03:05.495 --> 03:07.635
This is a small group of people,

03:07.670 --> 03:09.499
a governing body of some type

03:09.534 --> 03:13.089
restricting the
access of the body,

03:13.123 --> 03:17.093
of the masses to
something that they want.

03:18.715 --> 03:21.028
These are people who can
decide for themselves

03:21.062 --> 03:23.513
what's good for them or
possibly bad for them,

03:23.548 --> 03:26.551
but you have this
overreaching governing agency

03:26.585 --> 03:29.864
or government
enforcing their own

03:29.899 --> 03:33.627
ideals, morals on the masses.

03:34.697 --> 03:37.355
This is where things get wrong.

03:37.389 --> 03:39.253
And this is what
we're talking about

03:39.288 --> 03:41.911
when we talk about censorship
within this context,

03:41.945 --> 03:46.571
the video nasties, the
PRMC, the Satanic Panic,

03:46.605 --> 03:51.610
this whole era of restriction
of music and film and art

03:54.337 --> 03:58.928
in general from the masses.

03:58.962 --> 04:00.826
- So if you were lucky
enough to own a video player

04:00.861 --> 04:04.830
in the early 80s, you
had unrestricted access

04:04.865 --> 04:08.489
to a number of violent
horror gore films

04:08.524 --> 04:12.735
full of blood full of gore full
of splinters going in eyes,

04:12.769 --> 04:15.807
full of drills going in
heads, full of nudity,

04:15.841 --> 04:18.879
full of Nazis,
full of everything.

04:18.913 --> 04:22.020
The video nasties
are bloody amazing.

04:22.054 --> 04:25.265
They're very important for
film, for film history.

04:25.299 --> 04:27.784
I don't think there
isn't a film maker

04:28.682 --> 04:29.993
a horror film maker alive today

04:30.028 --> 04:33.238
who doesn't owe a
debt to a video nasty.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.067
They were such a big part
of our British culture

04:35.102 --> 04:37.863
and worldwide, they're
a worldwide phenomenon.

04:37.898 --> 04:41.453
- Even the word nasty,
what does it mean?

04:41.488 --> 04:44.042
At the time when that
phrase was coined,

04:44.076 --> 04:48.495
it was considered an
incredibly nasty, vicious film

04:48.529 --> 04:52.153
with a lot of violence,
usually sexualized violence.

04:52.188 --> 04:56.330
Women were the main target
and victims in these films.

04:56.365 --> 05:01.301
And certainly American films
I even find distasteful

05:02.440 --> 05:04.062
the early Wes Craven,
Last House on the Left,

05:04.096 --> 05:07.237
I Spit On Your Grave,
for example another
film from that genre

05:08.377 --> 05:12.242
which seemed to revel
in sexual violence

05:12.277 --> 05:14.900
and it's something that I've
never felt comfortable with.

05:14.935 --> 05:17.593
But whether those
films should be banned

05:17.627 --> 05:19.560
or whether they should
just have a warning on them

05:19.595 --> 05:21.666
is a controversial subject.

05:21.700 --> 05:23.668
Because if you talk
about banning things

05:23.702 --> 05:27.119
then you get into
that area where

05:27.154 --> 05:29.536
if you know Fahrenheit
451 essentially

05:29.570 --> 05:34.575
is the temperature of which
paper erupts into flame

05:35.956 --> 05:39.097
and that was kind of
exemplified as an example

05:39.131 --> 05:41.375
in that great film
of the same name.

05:42.411 --> 05:45.345
- Pretty much
everything on this list
is known for its brutality,

05:45.379 --> 05:48.140
movies like House on
the Edge of the Park.

05:48.175 --> 05:50.004
It's got a lot of rape scenes,

05:50.039 --> 05:52.559
but they're also very
violent in nature.

05:52.593 --> 05:54.664
The same thing with
Last House on the Left.

05:54.699 --> 05:57.046
I think that's sort of
what in a lot of ways

05:57.080 --> 05:58.599
what makes these
videos video nasty,

05:58.634 --> 06:00.843
it's just the
nastiness of it all.

06:00.877 --> 06:03.017
- I know the actual
New York repo

06:03.052 --> 06:06.538
and they actually escorted
that film out of the country

06:06.573 --> 06:08.851
because they didn't want anyone
even making bootleg copies

06:08.885 --> 06:11.405
or any distributor
getting hold of that film.

06:11.440 --> 06:14.650
So the New York repo
was actually escorted
out the country,

06:14.684 --> 06:16.065
which is really crazy.

06:16.099 --> 06:18.516
- But here's the problem
censorship inevitably runs into

06:18.550 --> 06:21.933
is that any time an art
form, music, film whatever

06:21.967 --> 06:26.489
is censored that inevitably
creates an underground movement,

06:26.524 --> 06:31.045
a collective of creative
people that are inspired by

06:31.080 --> 06:34.152
the restrictions that
have been placed upon them

06:34.186 --> 06:36.050
and seek to circumvent that

06:36.085 --> 06:38.984
and find new ways, new
forms of expression,

06:39.019 --> 06:41.435
more extreme forms of expression

06:41.470 --> 06:46.440
as a direct response to the
unfairness of the censorship.

06:50.099 --> 06:54.655
That whether it's hip hop,
whether it's punk rock,

06:54.690 --> 06:56.416
whether it's horror films,

06:56.450 --> 06:59.004
that underground
movement eventually

06:59.039 --> 07:00.385
because of that extremity

07:00.420 --> 07:03.975
because of the interest
in the rebelliousness

07:04.009 --> 07:05.977
of what they're trying to do

07:07.392 --> 07:10.947
that outside group inevitably
takes over the mainstream

07:10.982 --> 07:15.089
down the road and
becomes the mainstream.

07:15.124 --> 07:18.679
The real hilarious
thing about censorship

07:18.714 --> 07:21.510
is if you think about
things that have been

07:21.544 --> 07:26.549
censored from The Wolf Man
in 1931 to Friday the 13th

07:27.688 --> 07:31.658
to Where the Wild Things
Are it doesn't work.

07:32.037 --> 07:34.005
I mean in the end
over the long term,

07:34.039 --> 07:37.180
censorship does not
work, because eventually

07:37.215 --> 07:39.459
these things you're
trying suppress always

07:39.493 --> 07:42.047
get out there, always.

07:42.082 --> 07:44.015
That's the irony of censorship.

07:44.049 --> 07:45.499
- Censorship.

07:45.534 --> 07:48.053
- [Lloyd] There should be no
censorship in films whatsoever

07:48.088 --> 07:50.987
except for children, protect
the children, that's it.

07:52.644 --> 07:56.027
It was a disaster to ban
the movies in the 80s,

07:58.029 --> 08:00.169
like Mother's Day, Toxic Avenger

08:00.203 --> 08:03.828
because what you got
a 40-minute version

08:03.862 --> 08:05.415
of the Toxic Avenger.

08:05.450 --> 08:08.108
It wasted people's money,
it wasted their time

08:09.558 --> 08:11.387
and wasted very good art.

08:11.421 --> 08:13.907
There's no reason for
any kind of censorship.

08:13.941 --> 08:15.805
This is idiotic.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.773
- So it means that
what we're in danger of

08:17.807 --> 08:21.190
is throwing all of these films
into a great conflagration

08:21.224 --> 08:22.778
and destroying them forever

08:22.812 --> 08:26.851
and then a very valid part
of our movie history is lost.

08:26.885 --> 08:29.992
So I think that's what the
British government at the time

08:30.026 --> 08:33.478
had in mind when the list
of video nasties emerged,

08:33.513 --> 08:36.895
where they decided that
any film that had any kind

08:36.930 --> 08:41.866
of graphic violence was
considered beyond the taste

08:41.900 --> 08:45.352
of the British taste
makers and because of that

08:45.386 --> 08:49.563
they decided that the public
should not have access to them.

08:49.598 --> 08:52.532
They became an illegal list
whereby if you wanted them

08:53.671 --> 08:55.155
and they still were
available, you literally

08:55.189 --> 08:58.503
had to get them in a brown
paper bag under the counter

08:58.538 --> 09:00.850
and take them home and bring
them back in the same manner.

09:00.885 --> 09:03.094
- The story I heard is
that they had a Go Video

09:03.128 --> 09:06.097
once try to drum up some
publicity for his film

09:06.131 --> 09:08.064
so he sent a copy
to Mary Whitehouse

09:08.099 --> 09:11.447
pretending to be an angry
member of the public

09:11.481 --> 09:14.277
who had come across
it in a video store

09:14.312 --> 09:16.141
and he was hoping that
she'd complain about it

09:16.176 --> 09:18.799
and that would get people
going out and buying it.

09:18.834 --> 09:22.562
But instead it had a bit
of a catastrophic effect

09:22.596 --> 09:26.255
on the video industry
as a whole at the time

09:26.289 --> 09:27.497
because then it kickstarted

09:27.532 --> 09:31.778
the whole Department
of Public Prosecutions

09:32.917 --> 09:36.817
raids and making a
list and police raids.

09:36.852 --> 09:39.855
So I think that was the kind
of catalyst for the whole thing

09:39.889 --> 09:42.029
but most of the time you
would have video magazines

09:42.064 --> 09:44.376
that would have full page ads

09:44.411 --> 09:47.932
for stuff like The Dreaded
Cutter, Essex Experiment Camp

09:47.966 --> 09:52.868
and things like that
and the video industry

09:52.902 --> 09:54.455
didn't help themselves
at the time.

09:54.490 --> 09:58.114
- But as you can see from
the list of video nasties

09:58.149 --> 10:02.325
a lot of the films are
great Italian classics.

10:02.360 --> 10:05.294
You're looking at Suspiria,
one of the great art movies

10:05.328 --> 10:06.744
of the late 20th century.

10:06.778 --> 10:09.401
Looking at Tenebrae
another really beautiful,

10:09.436 --> 10:12.991
but extremely violent
film, which also had humor

10:13.026 --> 10:17.858
and some of the most
dramatic camera movements

10:17.893 --> 10:20.378
ever recorded in cinema history.

10:20.412 --> 10:23.657
You had the films
from Lucio Fulci,

10:23.692 --> 10:27.972
which again are extremely
violent zombie films,

10:28.006 --> 10:29.870
but they're zombie films.

10:29.905 --> 10:32.183
They're not to be
taken that seriously.

10:32.217 --> 10:33.702
Zombies are fantasy.

10:33.736 --> 10:35.704
As we can see now
in the 21st century,

10:35.738 --> 10:37.913
one of the biggest
shows on the planet

10:37.947 --> 10:39.155
is The Walking Dead.

10:39.190 --> 10:40.709
Now nobody is trying
to ban that show

10:40.743 --> 10:42.711
and it's far more
violent and aggressive

10:42.745 --> 10:45.748
than anything that came
out in the 70s and the 80s.

10:45.783 --> 10:50.235
Again I think video nasties
were a product of their time

10:50.270 --> 10:52.790
and a kind of ethos of the time

10:52.824 --> 10:56.241
of political correctness
where people felt that

10:56.276 --> 11:01.177
we need to safeguard the
moral life of the viewer.

11:03.732 --> 11:06.666
It is fascinating when you look
at the films on the list now

11:06.700 --> 11:09.254
you're looking at The Evil
Dead and you think well

11:09.289 --> 11:12.533
why was that film on the
list of video nasties?

11:12.568 --> 11:17.504
Probably because there was
penetration with a tree branch

11:17.538 --> 11:19.989
basically a women
was raped by a tree

11:20.024 --> 11:25.029
and then you also had a lot of
scenes of aggressive violence

11:26.237 --> 11:28.895
but again that sort of
thing was I think when

11:28.929 --> 11:31.794
sexualized violence
was included with

11:31.829 --> 11:34.555
the more mainstream
horror violence,

11:34.590 --> 11:37.524
then became a tricky area for
the taste makers in Britain.

11:37.558 --> 11:39.595
- Police and forces
were going around

11:39.629 --> 11:42.702
removing these video
tapes from video shops

11:42.736 --> 11:46.153
and burning them,
it's totally crazy.

11:46.188 --> 11:48.742
You think it wasn't that long
ago that this was happening.

11:48.777 --> 11:51.296
I mean where would these
bloody people be now?

11:51.331 --> 11:53.954
What would Mary Whitehouse
do with the Internet?

11:53.989 --> 11:57.337
Would she sit there
going around every webcam

11:57.371 --> 12:00.616
sex fucking website
trying to censor that?

12:00.650 --> 12:02.756
What would she be doing now?

12:02.791 --> 12:04.827
- They wanted to get people
to buy their products

12:04.862 --> 12:08.313
and they tried it in the most
sensationalist way possible

12:08.348 --> 12:12.697
and I think at the time
they could have been
more like if they hadn't done

12:12.732 --> 12:14.872
maybe we wouldn't
have had censorship

12:14.906 --> 12:17.529
or censorship wouldn't have
been so tough as it was.

12:20.256 --> 12:23.052
But they really kind
of in their need

12:23.087 --> 12:26.228
to try and get people
buying their videos

12:26.262 --> 12:28.230
they really went overboard

12:28.264 --> 12:29.818
because at the time when
videos first came out

12:29.852 --> 12:31.612
there wasn't any categorization.

12:31.647 --> 12:34.477
It was classed as a
publishing medium alongside

12:34.512 --> 12:37.757
books and music
and I don't know,

12:37.791 --> 12:40.794
it would be interesting to
see what would have happened

12:40.829 --> 12:44.004
with home video and
watching films at home

12:44.039 --> 12:47.836
if the home video nasty
scandal hadn't happened.

12:47.870 --> 12:51.115
I mean would it have gone
down the same path as

12:51.149 --> 12:55.015
publishing mediums like
books and music and stuff

12:55.050 --> 12:59.951
or would the classification
system be inevitable?

13:01.090 --> 13:03.713
- Well my views on
censorship as a whole,

13:03.748 --> 13:05.198
it's a tricky one isn't it?

13:05.232 --> 13:09.616
Because I'm a libertarian, I
believe in freedom of speech.

13:09.650 --> 13:13.240
We fought two world wars,
even English civil war

13:13.275 --> 13:15.449
was partly about the
freedom of speech.

13:15.484 --> 13:18.728
John Milton actually
wrote a famous pamphlet

13:18.763 --> 13:20.903
speaking about censorship
which I've read.

13:20.938 --> 13:22.836
That's even now
regarded as a classic.

13:22.871 --> 13:25.701
So even then back
in the 1640s, 50s

13:25.735 --> 13:28.152
people were against censorship.

13:28.186 --> 13:31.155
The only thing, where
do you cut the line?

13:31.189 --> 13:35.435
Where you have that point where
you think this is too much?

13:35.469 --> 13:38.162
- I think censorship it
needs to be in place.

13:38.196 --> 13:39.611
I mean there were
definitely movies

13:39.646 --> 13:42.200
that I was watching
when I was young

13:42.235 --> 13:46.791
that I really question
how I even got to do that.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.380
I really believe some
things just shouldn't

13:49.414 --> 13:51.485
be sent to young
persons you know.

13:51.520 --> 13:55.351
You need to be mature and you
need to have life experience

13:55.386 --> 13:58.527
to be able to digest what
it is that you're seeing

13:58.561 --> 14:00.909
so it doesn't affect
you in a negative way.

14:00.943 --> 14:04.774
Still baffled that a lot of the
stuff in America is unrated.

14:04.809 --> 14:07.812
I would die if one of
my kids grabbed a hold

14:07.847 --> 14:11.643
of Cannibal Holocaust and
they were 10 years old

14:11.678 --> 14:14.129
or something it's kind of scary.

14:14.163 --> 14:15.371
I think it's good
in this country,

14:15.406 --> 14:17.408
in Australia that we
have pretty strict laws

14:17.442 --> 14:20.342
on the classifications
because it is appropriate

14:20.376 --> 14:22.516
that some stuff that
kids shouldn't see

14:22.551 --> 14:25.278
until their minds are formed.

14:25.312 --> 14:27.176
- I think you've got
to have some boundaries

14:27.211 --> 14:29.627
with censorship because
I don't want to see

14:29.661 --> 14:32.043
inappropriate material
that children are being put

14:32.078 --> 14:34.045
in films and that.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.427
Because you can't have a
free-for-all I don't believe.

14:36.461 --> 14:37.704
So there's certain things which

14:37.738 --> 14:38.774
I don't think you should show.

14:38.808 --> 14:42.951
Stuff like kids,
but other things

14:42.985 --> 14:46.126
like people being
killed on camera,

14:46.161 --> 14:48.542
not for real of course, I
mean I'm totally against that

14:48.577 --> 14:50.924
because some people
even want to legalize

14:50.959 --> 14:53.237
so-called snuff movies
where people are actually

14:53.271 --> 14:56.412
being killed for real and
that should never be allowed

14:56.447 --> 14:58.311
to happen in any
civilized society

14:58.345 --> 15:00.451
that those films should
be made freely available

15:00.485 --> 15:04.179
if they even exist because some
people say it's just a myth.

15:04.213 --> 15:07.044
So censorship some
things are inappropriate,

15:07.078 --> 15:09.632
which I just said,
but on the whole,

15:09.667 --> 15:12.187
you can't censorship with
films like this to be honest

15:12.221 --> 15:13.671
because at the end of the day

15:13.705 --> 15:14.879
it's just actors, they're acting

15:14.914 --> 15:16.812
even if they weren't
that good some of them.

15:16.846 --> 15:17.882
It's just fiction.

15:19.021 --> 15:20.505
People who want to
ban all these films

15:20.540 --> 15:22.231
should get over it
in my humble opinion.

15:22.266 --> 15:25.200
- The idea of singling
out films in my opinion,

15:25.234 --> 15:27.685
it's just absurd the
whole idea of censorship

15:27.719 --> 15:30.377
in this day and age as well,
particular the Internet and--

15:30.412 --> 15:31.551
- Censorship.

15:31.585 --> 15:33.760
- The idea that you can get,
you can buy these things

15:33.794 --> 15:35.451
and the fact that you
know you had films

15:35.486 --> 15:37.143
that were banned for
years and years

15:38.316 --> 15:39.662
and then they've
all been released

15:39.697 --> 15:41.975
and there's been no
discernible affect on society.

15:42.010 --> 15:44.460
There's not been a sudden
uprise in violence and crimes

15:44.495 --> 15:46.186
and this is all
the sort of things

15:46.221 --> 15:47.532
that Mary Whitehouse
and Margaret Thatcher

15:47.567 --> 15:50.950
was trying these films
were responsible for

15:50.984 --> 15:54.884
when in fact it was her way
diverting attention away

15:54.919 --> 15:56.679
from how badly she's running
the country and stuff.

15:56.714 --> 15:58.785
With Mary Whitehouse,
I think she just wanted

15:58.819 --> 16:03.755
to make people follow the
kind of Christian viewpoint

16:04.964 --> 16:07.897
of what she believed
in and horror films

16:07.932 --> 16:09.347
didn't really fit in with that.

16:09.382 --> 16:11.315
- I've got a big thing
about censorship.

16:11.349 --> 16:14.421
It's really not endorsed
by anybody but myself,

16:14.456 --> 16:16.458
really my views on censorship

16:16.492 --> 16:20.117
we're at an age now where
films are so accessible,

16:20.151 --> 16:22.222
the imagery is so
accessible to everybody,

16:22.257 --> 16:23.430
so easy to get ahold of

16:24.604 --> 16:25.846
and we're also at
an age where people

16:25.881 --> 16:27.400
know what is fake
and what is real.

16:27.434 --> 16:28.642
They know how films are made.

16:28.677 --> 16:30.748
They know how special
effects are made.

16:30.782 --> 16:31.991
It wasn't like back in the day

16:32.025 --> 16:34.269
where you only had
Fangoria to look at,

16:34.303 --> 16:35.270
to look at behind the scenes,

16:35.304 --> 16:38.135
you know through
Blu-Ray releases

16:38.169 --> 16:39.757
and special features,
documentaries that we make

16:39.791 --> 16:42.587
that things are fake,
how to put together

16:42.622 --> 16:43.761
and the crews are doing it.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.902
So saying that
censorship is needed

16:46.936 --> 16:50.526
to protect people from imagery
they shouldn't be watching

16:50.561 --> 16:54.220
and also saying that
by watching those films

16:54.254 --> 16:56.601
people are affected
and will do things

16:56.636 --> 16:59.294
they shouldn't be doing is
I think is wrong really.

16:59.328 --> 17:01.296
Because I'm watched
horror films all my life

17:01.330 --> 17:03.470
and I'm not saying
it's one example,

17:03.505 --> 17:05.162
because I know
people have issues,

17:05.196 --> 17:08.027
but when people do have
issues regards to horror

17:08.061 --> 17:11.340
and do act out and
do blame horror films

17:11.375 --> 17:16.380
people who aren't exactly
people who's side are you on.

17:17.553 --> 17:19.521
The average Joe who
watches a horror film

17:19.555 --> 17:22.627
understands entertainment,
understands how it's made

17:22.662 --> 17:23.904
and enjoys it for what it is.

17:23.939 --> 17:27.356
- Yeah yeah yeah,
I kind of I agree.

17:29.358 --> 17:32.465
I think that's why we've
got certification of films.

17:32.499 --> 17:33.638
- But but--

17:33.673 --> 17:35.295
- No no I'm just saying
that's why right,

17:35.330 --> 17:38.160
it's how we
interpret stuff okay.

17:38.195 --> 17:41.922
We're one of the fortunate few
who have rightly brought up

17:41.957 --> 17:45.098
to see films we shouldn't
have at a young age

17:45.133 --> 17:47.204
against age restrictions right?

17:47.238 --> 17:50.862
And yeah we are two
living examples among many

17:50.897 --> 17:54.142
who have seen these films and
not one thing has happened.

17:54.176 --> 17:56.903
If anything it's
kind of huh exists.

17:57.973 --> 18:02.184
- It wasn't a kid's movie.

18:02.219 --> 18:04.324
- It actually inspired us.

18:05.532 --> 18:07.327
It inspired us to
do what we do now.

18:07.362 --> 18:09.329
- We wouldn't have met.
- We wouldn't have met

18:09.364 --> 18:11.297
except for a love of horror.

18:12.781 --> 18:14.162
- And there's a lot of people.

18:14.196 --> 18:15.922
Look at horror fans
who watch all these,

18:15.956 --> 18:18.338
making also you meet
all these people,

18:18.373 --> 18:20.754
the actors, the talent
behind these films

18:20.789 --> 18:25.138
they always say what a
wonderful crowd horror fans are,

18:25.173 --> 18:27.036
how loyal there
are and everything.

18:27.071 --> 18:30.454
There's gonna be
instances I have no doubt

18:30.488 --> 18:33.802
where people are affected
in different ways,

18:33.836 --> 18:35.321
but you know what it's
not just with films,

18:35.355 --> 18:36.839
it's with anything.

18:36.874 --> 18:40.740
It's that social backdrop,
do you know what I mean?

18:40.774 --> 18:42.845
It's how they were
brought up, et cetera.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.054
And also it's how
the mind works.

18:45.089 --> 18:48.437
- We're also in a culture
where we blame people--

18:48.472 --> 18:49.887
- Well they're scapegoats.

18:49.921 --> 18:52.061
- We blame other--
- Child's Play 3,

18:52.096 --> 18:53.960
Jamie Bulger.
- Exactly.

18:53.994 --> 18:57.032
We blame things to
make our case stronger.

18:57.066 --> 18:59.552
The guy who blamed
the Scream movies,

18:59.586 --> 19:01.864
the guy for the
killings that he did

19:01.899 --> 19:04.902
the guy who blamed
Nightmare on Elm Street.

19:04.936 --> 19:09.009
You said you know fortunately
Jamie Bulger case in the UK,
which was a big case.

19:09.044 --> 19:10.908
It obviously affected a lot
of people in this country.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.737
And Child's Play
3 suddenly banned,

19:12.772 --> 19:15.084
one and two isn't,
but Child's Play 3 is.

19:15.119 --> 19:16.672
- For one video.
- Because the children

19:16.707 --> 19:18.157
said they watched that movie

19:18.191 --> 19:19.813
and you know there are
similarities between

19:19.848 --> 19:21.090
Jamie Bulger and Chucky.

19:21.125 --> 19:24.646
But you can't then blame
the film for the actions

19:24.680 --> 19:28.512
of people who aren't
completely there.

19:28.546 --> 19:30.997
I knew as a
10-year-old when I was

19:31.031 --> 19:33.793
watching those films
they were pretend.

19:33.827 --> 19:37.106
I knew when I was 15,
those films were pretend.

19:37.141 --> 19:41.766
The fact they are on the screen
and are made to entertain.

19:41.801 --> 19:44.493
Horror is one of the biggest
entertainment genres around

19:44.528 --> 19:47.013
because people
love to be scared.

19:47.047 --> 19:50.603
Horror sounds nasty and
it can certainly be,

19:50.637 --> 19:51.880
with your Blumhouses and
you still have that--

19:51.914 --> 19:53.399
- I think the two
strongest emotions

19:53.433 --> 19:55.539
the two biggest things
you can react to

19:55.573 --> 19:57.334
is horror and comedy.
- Exactly.

19:57.368 --> 19:59.128
- It's a rollercoaster.

19:59.163 --> 20:00.475
It's just a movie.

20:00.509 --> 20:01.959
[screams]

20:01.993 --> 20:04.203
- [Announcer] Don't
Look in the Basement.

20:04.237 --> 20:08.621
The makers of Last House
On The Left warn you again

20:08.655 --> 20:12.487
to avoid fainting,
keep repeating,

20:12.521 --> 20:17.526
it's only a movie, only
a movie, only a movie.

20:21.668 --> 20:23.498
[screams]

20:23.532 --> 20:25.983
- Well I think censorship
thing just backfired.

20:26.017 --> 20:28.296
It basically promoted
to the curious

20:29.676 --> 20:33.473
all it did was made
everyone want to see these

20:33.508 --> 20:35.958
and here it is 40 years later

20:35.993 --> 20:37.719
and people are still
talking about them

20:37.753 --> 20:41.240
and wanting to see
what's all the fuss.

20:41.274 --> 20:43.483
Look where we are
right now with all

20:43.518 --> 20:46.866
re-releases on Blu-Ray
and vinyl releases.

20:46.900 --> 20:51.388
I mean the supply
and demand is there.

20:51.422 --> 20:54.494
I just wish a lot of the
film makers could see

20:56.255 --> 20:58.326
the popularity that it got

20:58.360 --> 20:59.982
because they can
finally get their due.

21:00.017 --> 21:03.089
- No, I do not think that
these movies should be banned

21:03.123 --> 21:06.265
or be put on any sort
of list like this.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.543
I mean you don't ban paintings

21:08.577 --> 21:11.477
and they really don't
ban books anymore.

21:11.511 --> 21:14.652
I think that no matter
how extreme the film is

21:14.687 --> 21:16.896
in it's nature, it's still art

21:16.930 --> 21:19.312
and I don't believe that
art should be censored.

21:20.900 --> 21:23.316
- I don't agree that
young children should
be watching films

21:23.351 --> 21:25.249
should be watching
violence films.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.734
I don't think a five-year-old
should be watching

21:27.769 --> 21:30.668
A Serbian Film or The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

21:30.703 --> 21:32.946
So in that way I do agree
that there should be

21:32.981 --> 21:35.777
some sort of classification
system put in place

21:35.811 --> 21:39.677
and young children
shouldn't have access

21:39.712 --> 21:41.196
to these sort of things.

21:41.230 --> 21:43.405
But when you get to
the 18s category,

21:43.440 --> 21:45.304
I think that a lesser
branch of the law,

21:47.029 --> 21:49.722
unless there's actually
something illegal

21:49.756 --> 21:51.240
going on in the film
then the whole idea

21:51.275 --> 21:55.831
that any kind of censorship
should exist is stupid.

21:58.489 --> 22:01.803
- Censorship should
video nasties be banned?

22:01.837 --> 22:03.736
Well now I don't
think they should.

22:03.770 --> 22:06.635
Because it's part
of a cinema history.

22:06.670 --> 22:08.050
It's part of the genre.

22:08.085 --> 22:09.569
If you ban them, people are

22:09.604 --> 22:11.709
just gonna want to see
them anyway, aren't they?

22:11.744 --> 22:13.746
History has shown whenever's
something's banned,

22:13.780 --> 22:15.817
people are gonna try and
find out why it's been banned

22:15.851 --> 22:18.682
and watch it so no they
shouldn't be banned.

22:18.716 --> 22:20.166
People are gonna get
them anyway, aren't they?

22:20.200 --> 22:22.962
You've got the Internet and
YouTube things like that

22:22.996 --> 22:25.136
so no they definitely
shouldn't be banned.

22:25.171 --> 22:27.380
- I think some yes and some no.

22:27.415 --> 22:31.488
Some of the movies
were quite gross.

22:31.522 --> 22:35.284
Others were probably more what
I would consider an R rating,

22:35.319 --> 22:37.321
which you could stomach.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.669
Perhaps back in the
80s, it might have been

22:40.704 --> 22:43.396
really gross and sort of
barbaric for some people,

22:43.431 --> 22:46.882
but I think definitely now
you'll see some of the movies

22:46.917 --> 22:50.369
that were an R rating
then are now an MA rating.

22:51.818 --> 22:53.786
So they've dropped as
we've been able to digest

22:53.820 --> 22:56.547
this material more and
more over the years.

22:56.582 --> 22:59.481
So I think at the time
some yes and some no.

23:00.586 --> 23:03.209
- Do I think they
should have been banned?

23:03.243 --> 23:04.728
It's hard to say that really

23:04.762 --> 23:07.040
because you're looking back,
you're looking back 30 years

23:07.075 --> 23:10.112
and you're thinking well,
these are just movies,

23:10.147 --> 23:12.736
how could they have
possibly have offended

23:12.770 --> 23:15.842
so many people to think
that they should be banned.

23:15.877 --> 23:19.225
But they were in
parts of the world

23:19.259 --> 23:21.538
and they were done
because there were fears

23:21.572 --> 23:26.163
that these would affect kids
and impressionable viewers.

23:26.197 --> 23:28.476
And to a degree,
you can sort of see

23:28.510 --> 23:30.650
that that does make some sense.

23:32.652 --> 23:34.274
You can imagine a little bit

23:34.309 --> 23:37.726
well I'm sure there is a
weird guy down the street

23:37.761 --> 23:40.453
who watches this movie
and he might get an idea.

23:40.488 --> 23:44.871
If he knocks on my door,
I can get beheaded, right?

23:46.045 --> 23:48.185
- No, I don't think
any of these films

23:48.219 --> 23:52.534
should have been put on
a list for the people

23:52.569 --> 23:55.157
can't consume them,
can't watch them.

23:55.192 --> 23:57.574
They're made to be
consumed by an audience.

23:58.954 --> 24:01.923
They're made for
adult entertainment.

24:01.957 --> 24:05.892
If anything, I'd say try harder

24:05.927 --> 24:08.481
to keep it out of the
hands of children I guess,

24:08.516 --> 24:11.450
but that doesn't fall back
on really the film maker.

24:11.484 --> 24:13.831
That falls on the
parents and the people

24:13.866 --> 24:18.560
that are letting them see the
films, you know what I mean?

24:19.803 --> 24:23.013
You have to be a certain
age to drink and smoke

24:23.047 --> 24:26.395
and watch porno you
know what I mean?

24:26.430 --> 24:29.088
It just throws something on that

24:29.122 --> 24:31.193
and get a little more
strict on that if you want,

24:31.228 --> 24:35.991
but I wouldn't
need to ban a film

24:36.026 --> 24:39.270
so nobody can see it,
unless people are actually

24:39.305 --> 24:43.067
being killed in the film
for the sake of the film.

24:43.102 --> 24:45.587
Not so much in a Face
of Death situation

24:45.622 --> 24:48.279
where it's supposedly
documented death

24:48.314 --> 24:50.523
where it happened and
it was caught on tape

24:50.558 --> 24:53.699
so they'll make
use of it that way.

24:56.356 --> 24:58.531
For the most part, it's all art.

24:58.566 --> 24:59.739
It's all entertainment.

25:01.776 --> 25:03.640
It's not real.

25:03.674 --> 25:05.365
There's stories being told
that might be a little

25:05.400 --> 25:09.369
more gorier than Gone
With the Wind and stuff,

25:09.404 --> 25:13.442
but that doesn't mean they
need to be blacklisted

25:13.477 --> 25:17.412
and cut out of the
womb of society

25:17.446 --> 25:18.965
so nobody could watch them.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.519
- When it comes to
do I think the film

25:20.553 --> 25:23.487
should have been banned and
put in the video nasty list,

25:23.522 --> 25:25.006
I don't feel like
they should have.

25:25.040 --> 25:27.940
I feel like they should have
warnings on the front cover

25:27.974 --> 25:30.874
of the videotapes that
says this movie should only

25:30.908 --> 25:34.256
be viewed by people 18 and up.

25:34.291 --> 25:36.362
They just should have really
good warnings on the ones

25:36.396 --> 25:38.053
that really were shocking.

25:38.088 --> 25:40.193
Because the idea
of banning a movie,

25:40.228 --> 25:42.575
because honestly
when you ban a movie,

25:42.610 --> 25:46.061
all it really does is put
more attention to the movie.

25:46.096 --> 25:48.098
It's kind of like
if your parent says

25:48.132 --> 25:50.445
you can't watch that,
you can't see that movie,

25:50.479 --> 25:52.551
that's not something you
should never see that,

25:52.585 --> 25:54.311
it makes you want
to watch it more.

25:54.345 --> 25:56.589
Like I remember when
I was in school,

25:56.624 --> 25:59.558
I remember there was a
sheriff that came into

25:59.592 --> 26:01.560
when I was in middle school,
I think I was in sixth grade

26:01.594 --> 26:04.286
he came in and said,
there's one movie

26:04.321 --> 26:07.842
you should never watch and it's
called Natural Born Killers.

26:07.876 --> 26:09.050
It's shocking.

26:09.084 --> 26:10.189
It's terrible.

26:10.223 --> 26:12.467
It has bad depictions of police,

26:12.501 --> 26:14.849
bad depictions of everybody,
he was going on and on and on

26:14.883 --> 26:17.645
about this list about it
again and again and again,

26:17.679 --> 26:20.440
continuously going on
about Natural Born Killers.

26:20.475 --> 26:22.408
You know what I did that night

26:22.442 --> 26:24.479
when I got back
home from school?

26:24.513 --> 26:26.930
I immediately rented the movie.

26:26.964 --> 26:30.209
- You know maybe you gotta
out of your way a little more

26:30.243 --> 26:32.867
to make sure that they don't
go into the wrong hands

26:32.901 --> 26:34.420
if that's what
you're worried about,

26:34.454 --> 26:37.630
but I don't think
really I don't think

26:37.665 --> 26:42.635
horror movies have ever
really caused problems

26:45.431 --> 26:46.743
in the sense that
they're thinking of

26:46.777 --> 26:48.952
in killing people and stuff.

26:48.986 --> 26:50.643
I think that when
somebody goes out

26:50.678 --> 26:52.645
and they kill somebody

26:52.680 --> 26:54.716
they're killing somebody
because they want to kill them.

26:54.751 --> 26:59.687
I feel like whether they grew
up watching Pound Puppies

27:01.102 --> 27:05.209
24/7 their entire life if
it's in them to kill somebody,

27:06.072 --> 27:07.522
then they'll kill somebody.

27:07.556 --> 27:10.318
I don't think watching
The Beyond or Blood Feast

27:10.352 --> 27:13.735
is something that's gonna
send them over the edge.

27:15.806 --> 27:18.878
But I think yeah all
censorship in a whole

27:20.121 --> 27:21.674
is not a good thing.

27:22.710 --> 27:25.298
People shouldn't be dictated to

27:26.714 --> 27:28.819
on what they need to do
or what they need to watch

27:28.854 --> 27:31.684
and what they can and can't do.

27:31.719 --> 27:33.410
Because I think people
are they have free will

27:33.444 --> 27:36.275
and they should be able to
make their own decisions.

27:37.897 --> 27:41.004
- Yes, so I think
banning a movie,

27:41.038 --> 27:44.801
all it really does is bringing
more attention to the movies

27:44.835 --> 27:47.562
so making it so people
were like you're gonna ban,

27:47.596 --> 27:49.737
I'm gonna find some
way to watch it.

27:49.771 --> 27:53.154
All it really was doing is
making more and more people

27:53.188 --> 27:55.846
have to go out and find any
way they can to sort out

27:55.881 --> 27:59.643
and find the movie with bootlegs
or anything that they could

27:59.678 --> 28:02.370
sending away from
the copy from the US.

28:02.404 --> 28:04.199
Anything that's
all it really did.

28:04.234 --> 28:05.753
So banning it, I
really don't think

28:05.787 --> 28:07.375
that was the way to do it.

28:07.409 --> 28:09.515
And I also really hate the
idea of banning something

28:09.549 --> 28:11.724
and saying you can't watch that.

28:11.759 --> 28:12.932
That's I don't
know I just really

28:12.967 --> 28:15.901
hate the concept of
doing that to a movie

28:15.935 --> 28:17.937
and censoring it and
all that kind of stuff.

28:17.972 --> 28:19.180
- Should there have been a ban?

28:19.214 --> 28:21.044
You've got these
movies being made,

28:21.078 --> 28:25.600
they are produced they
are funded by studios,

28:25.634 --> 28:26.843
financed independently.

28:26.877 --> 28:28.637
- I mean a lot of them
were done quiet rough.

28:28.672 --> 28:30.432
- Yeah, some of
them were European,

28:30.467 --> 28:32.780
they were being
released in Europe,

28:32.814 --> 28:34.264
released in America,
banned here.

28:34.298 --> 28:37.854
Now obviously we had a
particular issue in the UK

28:37.888 --> 28:39.303
in regards to these films.

28:39.338 --> 28:41.167
Now obviously we had
mentioned before was BBFC

28:41.202 --> 28:42.824
was Mary Whitehouse,
so should they have

28:42.859 --> 28:44.757
been banned because of that?

28:44.792 --> 28:45.965
No they shouldn't have been.
- No.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.415
- They were banned
because of an agenda

28:47.449 --> 28:49.348
from a particular
political group

28:49.382 --> 28:51.108
or a particular organization

28:51.143 --> 28:54.802
who deemed those films
to be inappropriate.

28:54.836 --> 28:56.907
They weren't banned because

28:56.942 --> 28:59.220
there was an uproar from
the community in the public,

28:59.254 --> 29:02.292
far from it, actually the
public were drawn towards

29:02.326 --> 29:05.260
these films even more so
because they were banned.

29:05.295 --> 29:06.952
- That's the thing ultimately,

29:06.986 --> 29:09.540
I'm talking about all
this in retrospect--

29:09.575 --> 29:11.370
- Of course yeah.
- We weren't there at the time

29:11.404 --> 29:13.303
in the sense of knowing--
- I've done my research

29:13.337 --> 29:18.342
and watching, so talk
about me maybe on this,

29:19.205 --> 29:21.552
on this our kind of experiences.

29:21.587 --> 29:26.454
So for me, I got into horror
films from a very early age

29:26.488 --> 29:29.802
and in fact, doing
the story part now

29:29.837 --> 29:33.288
my first encounter
with a video nasty,

29:33.323 --> 29:35.428
albeit I didn't
realize it at the time

29:35.463 --> 29:38.707
was the original Texas
Chainsaw Massacre.

29:40.019 --> 29:43.643
My old man I had actually
seen Part 2 first

29:43.678 --> 29:45.887
on a pirate Dutch
video, my dad had it

29:45.922 --> 29:48.614
and the reason I think we
got on to watching that

29:48.648 --> 29:51.651
was because I think I was
helping him organized his vinyls

29:51.686 --> 29:55.034
and he had the original
soundtrack Chainsaw Massacre 2.

29:55.069 --> 29:56.518
The cover threw
me straight away.

29:56.553 --> 29:58.175
It was the breakfast club shot,

29:58.210 --> 30:00.039
which now it's
absolutely hilarious.

30:00.074 --> 30:02.662
When you're a little kid and
you see this hideous face

30:02.697 --> 30:07.046
with a chainsaw and nubbins,
corpse, it was terrifying.

30:07.081 --> 30:08.013
We watched it.

30:08.047 --> 30:08.979
I was entertained.

30:09.014 --> 30:10.291
I was terrified.

30:11.499 --> 30:13.328
But you know it was a
memorable experience.

30:13.363 --> 30:15.020
Then not long
afterwards he dug out

30:15.054 --> 30:20.059
his original Iver Film Services
VHS box of Chainsaw Massacre

30:21.371 --> 30:24.650
the original like it
was just the silhouette

30:24.684 --> 30:27.170
Leatherface waving
the chainsaw around.

30:27.204 --> 30:31.760
Thrown all over the box is
uncut, uncensored, it happened,

30:31.795 --> 30:36.800
completely sensationalizing
the product.

30:37.663 --> 30:39.527
And he popped it on and
I think I only watched

30:39.561 --> 30:42.979
a segment first it was when
Kirk runs into the house

30:43.013 --> 30:46.430
and Pam does as well and
they both met their demises.

30:46.465 --> 30:50.883
So I'd experienced horror,
but never on that level

30:50.918 --> 30:53.092
and unfortunately
the bar was set then

30:53.127 --> 30:55.301
and not much in the year since

30:55.336 --> 30:57.027
has the had same impact on me.

30:57.062 --> 30:59.892
- I don't really
believe in censorship.

30:59.927 --> 31:02.826
I don't really see
the point behind it,

31:02.861 --> 31:04.517
particularly in
this day and age.

31:06.036 --> 31:09.798
But the BBFC's
viewpoint has always

31:09.833 --> 31:14.838
that they will ban
something if they feel that

31:15.943 --> 31:18.946
it can cause harm
through to an individual

31:18.980 --> 31:22.639
or to society for the
actions of an individual,

31:22.673 --> 31:24.779
which I think is just
something that's just

31:24.813 --> 31:28.196
never been proved,
it's just illogical.

31:28.231 --> 31:30.889
It's like saying
you know for example

31:30.923 --> 31:34.685
if you take something like
a gun, a gun is harmful.

31:34.720 --> 31:37.930
It's been proved to cause
harm, so therefore we ban it.

31:37.965 --> 31:41.071
But when it comes to films,
to say that some people

31:41.106 --> 31:44.833
might watch a film and go out
and cause harm or whatever,

31:45.973 --> 31:49.321
while other people
might not is pretty much

31:49.355 --> 31:52.117
kind of proves that
films don't cause harm.

31:54.395 --> 31:56.776
The way that people
act in society

31:56.811 --> 32:00.056
comes back the whole kind
of nature, nurture debate.

32:00.090 --> 32:03.818
It's all about how
someone was brought up,

32:03.852 --> 32:08.857
their kind of how they learn
about ethics and morality

32:10.273 --> 32:12.896
and how they understand their
actions cause harm to others

32:12.931 --> 32:15.416
or it can be through the
nature side of things.

32:15.450 --> 32:20.179
If someone has some sort of
mental problems in their brain,

32:20.214 --> 32:23.113
if it's like caused
through genetics

32:23.148 --> 32:27.255
or it's caused through in
psychology I learned about

32:27.290 --> 32:30.569
how someone's frontal
lobe gets damaged

32:30.603 --> 32:32.571
and that relates to
their theory of mind

32:32.605 --> 32:36.747
and how their
understanding of their

32:36.989 --> 32:38.818
actions causes harm
to other people.

32:39.819 --> 32:40.786
These are the sort of things

32:40.820 --> 32:42.029
that make people
go out and kill.

32:42.063 --> 32:43.996
If you've been brought
up as a normal person,

32:44.031 --> 32:46.930
you're brought up, you
understand the difference

32:46.965 --> 32:48.449
between right and wrong.

32:48.483 --> 32:51.003
You understand that your
actions have consequences

32:51.038 --> 32:53.247
and you understand the
feelings of other people,

32:53.281 --> 32:54.627
you're not gonna watch a film

32:54.662 --> 32:58.114
and then have all of
those beliefs changed.

32:58.148 --> 33:01.945
If I spent the weekend watching
the film Reservoir Dogs,

33:01.980 --> 33:03.395
I'm not gonna go out on Monday

33:03.429 --> 33:04.810
and start cutting
policemen's ears off.

33:04.844 --> 33:09.194
That's just not how
human beings work.

33:10.333 --> 33:13.992
I think if a film
doesn't break the law,

33:14.026 --> 33:16.373
if it's not like
child pornography

33:16.408 --> 33:19.998
or a real life snuff film or
doesn't have animal cruelty in,

33:21.413 --> 33:24.140
then I don't think that
anything should be banned.

33:24.174 --> 33:25.555
I think it's absurd as well,

33:25.589 --> 33:27.867
the fact that we
still have stuff like

33:27.902 --> 33:30.318
A Serbian Film is banned.

33:30.353 --> 33:32.700
The full, uncut version
is still being cut.

33:34.219 --> 33:35.979
Yet, you can go onto Amazon now

33:36.014 --> 33:39.258
and buy the full
uncut Swedish release

33:39.293 --> 33:41.847
next to the
BBFC-approved version.

33:41.881 --> 33:43.642
I don't understand what
these people are doing

33:43.676 --> 33:45.782
in their little SoHo office.

33:47.163 --> 33:51.236
It just seems a bit crazy
idea that they still sit there

33:51.270 --> 33:55.136
and they still agonize
over which bits to cut

33:55.171 --> 33:57.345
and which bits to leave in.

33:57.380 --> 34:01.108
Oh should we is this okay,
should we have this shot here?

34:01.142 --> 34:04.145
As if any of that
really matters.

34:06.665 --> 34:10.738
Like I said, going back to the
and the other thing as well

34:10.772 --> 34:13.706
you get films which
were banned once

34:13.741 --> 34:15.329
and then have now been released.

34:16.226 --> 34:21.093
Their logic has always been that

34:21.128 --> 34:25.097
well society's changed
and what was once harmful

34:25.132 --> 34:28.618
is now not harmful and going
back to my example of the gun.

34:30.413 --> 34:32.484
If I shot someone
with a gun now,

34:32.518 --> 34:37.523
if we waited 20 years
and then I shot someone,

34:38.628 --> 34:40.285
the fact that
society has changed

34:40.319 --> 34:44.910
or the world has changed,
it's still harmful.

34:44.944 --> 34:47.809
Whereas the idea of
a film being harmful

34:47.844 --> 34:50.847
and then not being
harmful is just illogical.

34:50.881 --> 34:55.507
We've got access to 24 hours
a day hardcore pornography.

34:55.541 --> 35:00.374
We haven't got a society full
of rapists and sex offenders

35:00.408 --> 35:01.720
as a result of it.

35:01.754 --> 35:03.653
- I'll tell you what is actually

35:03.687 --> 35:05.275
the silver bullet is technology.

35:05.310 --> 35:09.141
Technology will
always advance faster

35:09.176 --> 35:11.833
than oppression
can keep it down.

35:11.868 --> 35:16.873
You put warning labels
on tapes, on music,

35:18.046 --> 35:19.427
on heavy metal,
on hip hop and rap

35:19.462 --> 35:21.671
and people copy the tapes
and distribute them.

35:21.705 --> 35:24.570
You ban videos, you
ban horror movies

35:24.605 --> 35:26.848
from being sold
from video stores

35:26.883 --> 35:29.782
from being sold in the market
place and people copy them.

35:29.817 --> 35:33.303
You ban videos now, they
get up on the Internet.

35:33.338 --> 35:34.684
Technology is the silver bullet.

35:34.718 --> 35:36.030
Technology is the thing

35:36.064 --> 35:38.998
that always triumphs
over censorship.

35:39.033 --> 35:43.210
- It's about the
constant fear of what if.

35:43.244 --> 35:45.833
I think especially when
you become a parent,

35:45.867 --> 35:48.249
that comes into play a
lot, because you're always

35:48.284 --> 35:50.320
what if something
were to happen?

35:50.355 --> 35:54.911
What if something was
to happen to my child

35:54.945 --> 35:57.189
or yours or anybody else's,

35:57.224 --> 36:00.261
the people in society that need
more protection than others?

36:00.296 --> 36:02.298
And there's a feeling
that you want to take over

36:02.332 --> 36:06.716
and control or at least
make safe and make safe

36:06.750 --> 36:08.856
is an interesting term,
because you say make safe

36:08.890 --> 36:12.446
and yet making safe is not
it may be safe for you,

36:12.480 --> 36:14.482
but that's not safe
for everybody else.

36:14.517 --> 36:17.105
In fact, that's just
straight out controlling.

36:18.762 --> 36:20.902
That's where I think
a lot of the mindset

36:20.937 --> 36:24.354
was coming from within the
idea to ban these films.

36:25.562 --> 36:27.046
You gotta keep in mind that

36:27.081 --> 36:29.635
these were not just typical
horror films with the violence

36:29.670 --> 36:33.225
you would have already
seen or expected to see.

36:33.260 --> 36:35.952
Blood that was in
color and red and gore,

36:35.986 --> 36:37.816
I mean that was sort
of already there.

36:37.850 --> 36:41.095
People were expecting
some of that

36:41.129 --> 36:44.271
that was there, but
this was balls out.

36:44.305 --> 36:46.825
This was the stuff where
you would just figure

36:46.859 --> 36:49.793
if somebody was dying
by a knife or a machete

36:49.828 --> 36:52.934
that's bad enough, but to
have them chopped into pieces

36:52.969 --> 36:55.868
or guts pulled out or
somebody's eating the guts

36:55.903 --> 36:58.492
and then you turn around
you cut off the head

36:58.526 --> 37:00.804
next person who's
watching this happen.

37:00.839 --> 37:02.772
I mean that's just
going for broke.

37:02.806 --> 37:05.533
You cut off the genitals
and eat that penis,

37:05.568 --> 37:07.294
because everybody
in cannibal land

37:07.328 --> 37:09.882
seems to want to eat the
genitals, I don't know why.

37:09.917 --> 37:14.680
Anyway, there's this idea that
it's not just a horror movie,

37:14.715 --> 37:17.235
it's not just what you
might expect to see

37:17.269 --> 37:22.240
down in the cinema,
it's no restrictions.

37:23.655 --> 37:25.588
It's balls out in your face.

37:25.622 --> 37:27.521
Whatever you could
imagine what would happen

37:27.555 --> 37:29.626
would happen in these movies.

37:29.661 --> 37:32.664
- [Announcer] To avoid
fainting, keep repeating--

37:32.698 --> 37:36.357
- [Crowd] It's only a
movie, it's only a movie,

37:36.392 --> 37:37.841
it's only a movie.

37:37.876 --> 37:40.188
- What's great about
video nasties I think

37:40.223 --> 37:43.847
is it's something that
doesn't exist at all anymore.

37:43.882 --> 37:45.953
Don't get me wrong,
there's still censorship,

37:45.987 --> 37:47.644
but what we have now these days

37:47.679 --> 37:50.820
is ease of access
to all these films.

37:50.854 --> 37:51.959
You can download them.

37:51.993 --> 37:53.167
You can buy them in shops.

37:53.201 --> 37:56.066
Half of them are now
available in Poundland.

37:56.101 --> 37:58.655
- Yeah and I also think
the audience's perception

37:58.690 --> 38:00.381
of what is gory and
what is horrific

38:00.416 --> 38:03.246
and also censorship itself
has completely changed now.

38:03.281 --> 38:06.111
Whereas you look back in
the video nasties of the day

38:06.145 --> 38:08.355
and actually in
today's comparison,

38:08.389 --> 38:11.841
they're kind of tame, we
said when we we're talking

38:11.875 --> 38:15.258
about our own that these films,

38:15.293 --> 38:17.916
some of them aren't
the greatest of films.

38:17.950 --> 38:19.331
But they have
become cult classics

38:19.366 --> 38:21.299
because they were
labeled as video nasties.

38:21.333 --> 38:24.025
- I don't really think these
films should have been banned.

38:24.060 --> 38:25.717
I mean okay they've
got a rating,

38:25.751 --> 38:28.858
so you've got a rating
for a film that's fine.

38:28.892 --> 38:31.101
But they shouldn't have
been outright banned.

38:31.136 --> 38:34.139
It wasn't just children who
were seeing these films.

38:34.173 --> 38:35.968
It was adults who
were being told

38:36.003 --> 38:39.144
they couldn't watch
the video nasties.

38:39.178 --> 38:41.595
So these were being
banned from everybody.

38:41.629 --> 38:43.562
The major thing was children

38:43.597 --> 38:46.324
might see these at
home or whatever.

38:46.358 --> 38:47.532
But what about the adults?

38:47.566 --> 38:49.188
Can't they make
their own mind up?

38:49.223 --> 38:51.294
That's what I really
didn't get is how

38:52.709 --> 38:55.643
they didn't even put a rating
on it or anything like that.

38:55.678 --> 39:00.165
[dramatic music]
[screaming]

39:00.199 --> 39:02.305
Adults couldn't
even make a decision

39:02.340 --> 39:04.583
to watch these films or not.

39:04.618 --> 39:05.791
So I really don't
think these films

39:05.826 --> 39:07.034
should have been banned at all.

39:07.068 --> 39:08.967
- Perhaps they were
seeing the title alone

39:09.001 --> 39:11.694
and they were
imagining in their mind

39:11.728 --> 39:13.143
what was happening
in this movie,

39:13.178 --> 39:16.008
what could possibly
be in this movie.

39:16.043 --> 39:17.838
And of course you've got
to give it to the people

39:17.872 --> 39:20.081
making the box covers
because you look at something

39:20.116 --> 39:22.567
like Driller Killer
and you see the drill

39:22.601 --> 39:24.292
going into the guy's head.

39:24.327 --> 39:27.710
It's puncturing the skull
and it's drilling away

39:27.744 --> 39:29.608
and all the blood
is coming down.

39:29.643 --> 39:32.991
The guy is screaming and it's
probably in his brain already.

39:33.025 --> 39:38.030
And you gotta imagine if
that's on the box cover,

39:39.135 --> 39:40.516
my God, what else
could be in this movie?

39:41.413 --> 39:43.381
- The Last House on the Left,

39:43.415 --> 39:46.038
this film was on the
banned nasties list.

39:46.073 --> 39:48.938
It was rejected
until 2000, I think,

39:48.972 --> 39:50.802
I think they submitted
it again in 2000

39:50.836 --> 39:53.598
and then it was rejected
and then in 2003,

39:53.632 --> 39:57.912
they allowed a cut
version to be released.

39:57.947 --> 40:00.259
And then in 2007, it
was submitted again

40:00.294 --> 40:03.228
and they allowed
it through uncut.

40:03.262 --> 40:07.197
I'm thinking when it
was banned in 2000

40:07.232 --> 40:10.166
and they said no, you
can't release this film,

40:10.200 --> 40:12.824
did they honestly believe
that it was harmful then?

40:12.858 --> 40:15.654
Then 10 years later,
or less than 10 years

40:15.689 --> 40:18.105
they'd allow it to be
released fully uncut?

40:18.139 --> 40:21.695
I mean are there admitting
that they were wrong

40:21.729 --> 40:24.801
and they're saying
we were wrong,

40:24.836 --> 40:26.562
it's not actually
a harmful film.

40:26.596 --> 40:27.494
It's illogical.

40:27.528 --> 40:29.047
It doesn't make any sense.

40:29.081 --> 40:31.912
I've seen all these films and
I don't go out killing people.

40:31.946 --> 40:33.983
Going back to video nasties,

40:34.017 --> 40:37.469
the only thing which I
do agree with being cut

40:37.504 --> 40:39.471
or censored is
the animal cruelty

40:39.506 --> 40:42.854
which comes into a lot of
the Italian cannibal films

40:42.888 --> 40:46.823
unfortunately because that
does, that breaks the law.

40:46.858 --> 40:49.826
Animal cruelty is illegal.

40:49.861 --> 40:52.657
We don't really
want to watch it.

40:52.691 --> 40:55.936
I agree like I said
anything that breaks the law

40:55.970 --> 40:59.284
shouldn't be
allowed in the film,

40:59.318 --> 41:02.494
but when it comes
to made-up violence

41:02.529 --> 41:05.980
and fake effects and
things like that,

41:06.015 --> 41:08.155
then there's no logical reason

41:08.189 --> 41:09.708
to keep banning
that sort of thing,

41:09.743 --> 41:11.227
to keep censoring
that sort of thing.

41:11.261 --> 41:12.780
- Video nasties I always found

41:12.815 --> 41:14.782
a very interesting
subject matter

41:14.817 --> 41:17.336
because over the years I
think a lot of the films

41:17.371 --> 41:22.100
that were considered video
nasties are art films.

41:22.134 --> 41:23.964
They're actually really
beautiful examples

41:23.998 --> 41:29.003
of how horror could be enter
like the art mainstream.

41:30.384 --> 41:33.180
I know in a way that sounds
like a contradiction,

41:33.214 --> 41:35.113
where a lot of people
think art movies

41:35.147 --> 41:39.497
are Ingmar Bergman and Antonioni

41:39.531 --> 41:41.637
or people like that, and
of course those films

41:41.671 --> 41:43.604
are really artistic,
but the reason is

41:43.639 --> 41:48.057
the Italians always
took a very blanket view

41:48.091 --> 41:51.439
of making a film, whereas
they actually thought

41:51.474 --> 41:54.684
and rightfully so
that the visual aspect

41:54.719 --> 41:58.619
of making a film
and the audio aspect

41:58.654 --> 42:00.656
should marry as a
really beautiful thing.

42:00.690 --> 42:05.108
Even if the subject matter
is dark and the Italians felt

42:05.143 --> 42:07.628
that the overall package
should be beautiful.

42:07.663 --> 42:08.905
I totally agree with that.

42:08.940 --> 42:11.011
I think that film
is a visual medium

42:11.045 --> 42:14.670
and so unless you are
creating something

42:14.704 --> 42:19.157
with a look that's meant
to be deliberately grungy

42:19.191 --> 42:22.056
because say it's
like a mockumentary

42:22.091 --> 42:24.231
or a fan film footage film,

42:24.265 --> 42:25.853
then I think films
should be beautiful,

42:25.888 --> 42:28.511
no matter how dark
the subject matter.

42:28.546 --> 42:31.997
I suppose in a way that
means when I talk about

42:32.032 --> 42:34.034
video nasties I'm
really thinking about

42:34.068 --> 42:37.002
the Italian films that
came out at the time.

42:37.037 --> 42:40.143
Of course when I rented
them as a boy on VHS,

42:40.178 --> 42:43.077
I always remember going
down to the VHS store

42:43.112 --> 42:45.079
and you'd find out the
latest horror movie

42:45.114 --> 42:48.289
had come in from Italy or
had come in from the USA.

42:48.324 --> 42:49.843
And they weren't
video nasties then.

42:49.877 --> 42:51.465
They were just the
latest horror movie

42:51.499 --> 42:53.812
and so many in retrospect
that these films

42:53.847 --> 42:55.642
are considered video nasties.

42:55.676 --> 42:59.128
- Horror films of
the 1970s and the 80s

42:59.162 --> 43:02.027
are notorious primarily
for their gore.

43:03.201 --> 43:06.480
I think it was a prime
period for horror films.

43:06.514 --> 43:09.621
The style had changed
way before then

43:09.656 --> 43:11.519
from the your gothic castles

43:11.554 --> 43:16.352
to the real world,
serial killers.

43:16.386 --> 43:17.767
- You change to mass
killer kind of films

43:17.802 --> 43:20.632
compared to your Dracula
films or your Hammer horrors.

43:20.667 --> 43:22.634
- And then by the late 70s,
you've got the odd zombie films.

43:22.669 --> 43:25.672
So you're dealing with
two kind of extremes.

43:25.706 --> 43:28.640
On the the one hand,
you've got you're gritty,

43:28.675 --> 43:31.470
realistic films like
Last House on the Left

43:31.505 --> 43:33.645
and then on the other
hand, you've got your

43:33.680 --> 43:38.201
beyond fantastical
films like Evil Dead.

43:38.236 --> 43:40.203
- But this was an issue
then for the censors

43:40.238 --> 43:42.965
that when these films like
Last House on the Left

43:42.999 --> 43:45.484
came out they were so
real in their terms,

43:45.519 --> 43:49.005
they weren't
monsters or vampires,

43:49.040 --> 43:50.628
they're sort of real
things happening.

43:50.662 --> 43:51.836
- And then that's
where you can probably

43:51.870 --> 43:54.183
like easily that question then.

43:54.217 --> 43:57.393
You know it's hard
for me to discern

43:57.427 --> 43:59.360
what should be and
shouldn't be banned.

43:59.395 --> 44:01.362
I think Gunner Hansen once said

44:01.397 --> 44:04.469
he finds it outrageous
a small group of people

44:04.503 --> 44:07.265
like the BBFC were able,

44:07.299 --> 44:09.716
all it has is a
small group of people

44:09.750 --> 44:12.235
who basically decide
whether everyone else

44:12.270 --> 44:13.961
can watch it or not.

44:13.996 --> 44:15.376
- Well, that's true,
you've got think about

44:15.411 --> 44:18.034
the types of people,
you're middle class people.

44:18.069 --> 44:20.692
- Video nasty was a mass
class divide, wasn't it?

44:20.727 --> 44:24.316
- Well yeah, Mary
Whitehouse this older lady,

44:24.351 --> 44:26.664
who was probably in
her 60s, 70s maybe--

44:26.698 --> 44:28.527
- And she hadn't even seen--
- She hadn't seen

44:28.562 --> 44:29.701
any of these horror films
that she was dictating

44:29.736 --> 44:30.944
to people--
- And then you had

44:30.978 --> 44:32.152
James Furman say the--
- James Furman yeah.

44:32.186 --> 44:34.741
- The impact of Texas
Chainsaw Massacre

44:34.775 --> 44:38.537
might not affect
your everyday person,

44:38.572 --> 44:41.609
but it might affect what
was it, a working class

44:41.644 --> 44:44.543
member from Birmingham like you.

44:44.578 --> 44:46.373
[laughs]

44:46.407 --> 44:50.480
And so going back on that
you're super realistic

44:50.515 --> 44:52.586
horror films because
that's what it was, right?

44:52.620 --> 44:55.140
It was either serial killers.

44:56.452 --> 44:58.074
I mean you had your
cannibal movies,

44:58.109 --> 44:59.455
but then you had
your zombie movies.

44:59.489 --> 45:02.492
So if I was to say, if
I was given the choice

45:02.527 --> 45:05.772
one of these is more
susceptible to being banned

45:05.806 --> 45:08.188
than the other then in my eyes

45:08.222 --> 45:09.983
because they're doing
it because the effect

45:10.017 --> 45:12.399
it might have on the audience.

45:12.433 --> 45:15.471
And in this instance,
their major worry is kids.

45:15.505 --> 45:19.371
Then in all reality, the ones
that should be looked at more

45:19.406 --> 45:21.339
would be your Last
House on the Left,

45:21.373 --> 45:23.824
because you're literally
I mean the thing is

45:23.859 --> 45:26.585
Wes Craven and I'll say
this as a fan of the film,

45:26.620 --> 45:29.519
Wes Craven never set out to
make Last House on the Left

45:29.554 --> 45:31.383
to glorify violence,
it was his--

45:31.418 --> 45:33.903
- Or to be a banned film.
- No, or to be a banned film,

45:33.938 --> 45:36.906
but it was his reaction
to the Vietnam War

45:36.941 --> 45:40.013
and the fact that the TV
was showing such violence.

45:40.047 --> 45:43.154
All right, we know that
as fans of the film

45:43.188 --> 45:45.743
and a lot of people do,
that that was his intent.

45:45.777 --> 45:47.641
The BBFC's perception of it was

45:47.675 --> 45:49.194
that it's glorifying violence.

45:49.229 --> 45:50.989
So ultimately it's
down the violence,

45:51.024 --> 45:54.682
but Last House on the Left,
you are kind of showing

45:54.717 --> 45:57.996
what could be a
very real situation,

45:58.031 --> 46:01.034
which no doubt there has
been situations like that.

46:01.068 --> 46:04.416
If there are to make a
decision on that or Evil Dead,

46:04.451 --> 46:07.488
which was also on that same
list and Zombie Flesh Eaters,

46:08.904 --> 46:10.975
then that would be the one,
at least I personally lean

46:11.009 --> 46:12.562
more towards if there
was ones to be banned.

46:12.597 --> 46:14.012
Because--
- But why like you said,

46:14.047 --> 46:15.980
why was a small group of
people banning those films?

46:16.014 --> 46:18.879
What was it about
those particular films?

46:18.914 --> 46:21.744
- One of my memories
of renting was

46:21.779 --> 46:23.056
when we got I Spit On Your Grave

46:23.090 --> 46:25.644
and I watched it with
two of my friends

46:25.679 --> 46:28.302
probably around 12 or 13.

46:28.337 --> 46:31.167
My dad walked in me,
the scene right where

46:32.030 --> 46:33.514
the rape was about to start

46:33.549 --> 46:36.172
and he just sat down with
us and started watching it.

46:36.207 --> 46:38.554
We were like just
laughing uncontrollably

46:38.588 --> 46:40.936
because we were just
basically embarrassed

46:40.970 --> 46:43.076
we didn't know how to process it

46:43.110 --> 46:45.319
and he just turned to us
and said, this isn't funny.

46:45.354 --> 46:46.596
We just felt so stupid,

46:46.631 --> 46:48.253
but he ended up watching
the whole thing with us.

46:48.288 --> 46:50.773
- I think in a lot of ways
the video rental store

46:50.808 --> 46:53.396
was sort of a gateway
to the video nasty.

46:54.570 --> 46:57.021
I remember renting both
Last House on the Left

46:57.055 --> 46:58.401
and I Spit On Your Grave

46:58.436 --> 47:00.300
for the first time
at a video store.

47:00.334 --> 47:02.371
I remember when I rented
Last House on the Left,

47:02.405 --> 47:04.891
I had to rent it on my
dad's rental account

47:04.925 --> 47:07.445
because of course I wasn't
old enough at the time.

47:08.618 --> 47:10.862
The movie actually
got eaten in his VCR

47:10.897 --> 47:12.381
and I remember he
got really upset

47:12.415 --> 47:13.865
and told me this is what happens

47:13.900 --> 47:15.798
when you try
watching old movies.

47:15.833 --> 47:17.662
So I'll always have that memory

47:17.696 --> 47:19.043
from watching Last
House on the Left,

47:19.077 --> 47:21.045
renting it at the store.

47:21.079 --> 47:23.288
Then I also remember
I Spit On Your Grave

47:23.323 --> 47:25.290
from the time I was 15 I think

47:25.325 --> 47:27.603
and so I had to have an
older friend rent it for me

47:27.637 --> 47:30.675
actually and he made a
bootleg copy of it on video

47:30.709 --> 47:32.953
with photocopy guard so

47:32.988 --> 47:34.713
I could watch it in
on my own any time.

47:34.748 --> 47:36.923
Because at the time that movie
hadn't really been available

47:36.957 --> 47:40.029
here other than the
Wizard release in America

47:40.064 --> 47:41.928
and obviously it
was a video nasty,

47:41.962 --> 47:45.414
so it was practically
impossible to find at the time.

47:45.448 --> 47:47.657
So I always have those memories

47:47.692 --> 47:50.522
and they definitely stick
out for that reason.

47:50.557 --> 47:52.870
- I've got so many
favorite video nasties.

47:52.904 --> 47:54.872
I love Cannibal Ferox.

47:54.906 --> 47:56.218
That is one of my favorite ones,

47:56.252 --> 47:58.323
really do love this
film, Cannibal Ferox.

47:59.773 --> 48:02.120
I think this is actually
a bootleg copy as well.

48:02.983 --> 48:04.743
I paid about 50 quid for this.

48:05.744 --> 48:07.091
I actually remember years ago,

48:07.125 --> 48:09.990
these did have a
small box like this,

48:10.025 --> 48:12.579
but this one does look
like a bootleg version.

48:12.613 --> 48:16.307
I think this actual
label is far too shiny,

48:16.341 --> 48:17.860
if you can see that one there.

48:19.793 --> 48:22.002
So I actually think
this is a bootleg.

48:22.037 --> 48:25.799
Cannibal Ferox is one of my
favorite all time video nasties.

48:25.833 --> 48:28.353
I love the actual
soundtrack, the score.

48:28.388 --> 48:29.596
It was so shocking.

48:29.630 --> 48:31.805
When you actually
watch this film,

48:31.839 --> 48:35.222
I remember seeing
this as a bootleg copy

48:35.257 --> 48:37.949
and it scared the shit
out of me, this film.

48:37.984 --> 48:39.192
It's bloody brilliant.

48:39.226 --> 48:42.816
That haunting score,
you hear this music,

48:42.850 --> 48:45.819
this synth kind of prog
rock music come up,

48:45.853 --> 48:47.579
the same part all throughout

48:47.614 --> 48:49.857
and you know there's
gonna be a death scene

48:49.892 --> 48:51.963
or a killing scene,
so I think one of my

48:51.998 --> 48:53.827
all time favorites
is Cannibal Ferox.

48:53.861 --> 48:56.864
[creepy rock music]

49:02.180 --> 49:04.355
[screams]

49:06.184 --> 49:09.360
- My favorite video
nasty is probably

49:09.394 --> 49:11.396
it's a tough call
but I'd probably say

49:11.431 --> 49:14.399
either The Evil Dead
or Cannibal Holocaust

49:14.434 --> 49:18.507
because those movies are
really balls to the wall

49:18.541 --> 49:21.889
and really intense and
you take the Evil Dead

49:21.924 --> 49:24.444
that's a little more cartoony

49:24.478 --> 49:26.687
than Cannibal
Holocaust would be.

49:26.722 --> 49:28.413
Because Cannibal
Holocaust was pretty much

49:28.448 --> 49:31.761
just a documentary, but
it's a fake documentary,

49:31.796 --> 49:34.247
but it's shot entirely
like a documentary

49:34.281 --> 49:37.422
so you're supposed to believe
that these things are real.

49:37.457 --> 49:39.562
And then The Evil Dead
you're not supposed

49:39.597 --> 49:41.357
to believe these
things are real.

49:41.392 --> 49:44.567
It's a very kind of
far out there tale

49:48.054 --> 49:52.334
of just gore and madness.

49:52.368 --> 49:56.441
Cannibal Holocaust is
more along the lines

49:56.476 --> 49:57.822
is this is what happens on

49:57.856 --> 49:59.997
the other side of
the world type deal,

50:01.101 --> 50:04.035
which is scary, because
it's that unknown.

50:04.070 --> 50:08.902
You'll probably never find
yourself in a situation

50:08.936 --> 50:12.561
where you'd have to deal
with that group of people,

50:12.595 --> 50:15.184
but it's still scary to
know that they're out there.

50:16.565 --> 50:19.809
- I think for me definitely
Flesh For Frankenstein

50:19.844 --> 50:22.088
as I had been watching
all these horror movies,

50:22.122 --> 50:23.813
when I finally
discovered that one,

50:23.848 --> 50:26.195
actually there was two films,
there was Blood for Dracula,

50:26.230 --> 50:28.542
which were both
Andy Warhol films.

50:28.577 --> 50:30.475
But they're both
borderline pornographic

50:30.510 --> 50:34.824
and I think being a teenager,
a pubescent teenager

50:34.859 --> 50:39.243
starting to get really
interested in the other sex.

50:40.347 --> 50:41.452
And finding these movies

50:41.486 --> 50:44.041
were sort of borderline
pornographic,

50:44.075 --> 50:46.560
but had the horror and the
gore that I really loved,

50:46.595 --> 50:48.424
so definitely Flesh
For Frankenstein,

50:48.459 --> 50:49.736
that would be my favorite.

50:50.978 --> 50:53.015
- I would have to say
my favorite is Absurd

50:53.050 --> 50:55.052
and it's actually one
of the latest entries

50:55.086 --> 50:57.813
from my findings,
I first heard of it

50:57.847 --> 51:00.954
from the soundtrack and was
immediately blown away by it.

51:00.988 --> 51:05.131
And as a film, it checks
every box for video nasties,

51:05.165 --> 51:07.961
and of course it's
got the great score,

51:07.995 --> 51:09.273
but the story is good.

51:09.307 --> 51:11.171
It's intriguing, it's
actually one of the few

51:11.206 --> 51:13.311
that you don't have
to check your watch

51:13.346 --> 51:16.383
and you don't have
to fast forward it.

51:16.418 --> 51:20.007
The story is entertaining
and it keeps you entertained.

51:20.042 --> 51:22.251
It definitely takes
a lot from Halloween,

51:22.286 --> 51:26.013
but that's cool and
George Eastman rules.

51:26.048 --> 51:30.017
It delivers on very,
checks every box.

51:30.052 --> 51:32.951
- I guess maybe around
here we called them

51:32.986 --> 51:37.991
bootleg the old VHSes
back in the day,

51:39.165 --> 51:42.099
you'd see guys selling
out of a trunk of a car.

51:43.686 --> 51:46.482
Some people because
they rip people off

51:46.517 --> 51:48.174
and in some cases because
they were too violent

51:48.208 --> 51:50.693
and sexually explicit.

51:50.728 --> 51:55.698
Now this stuff was very
sought after when I was a kid,

51:56.941 --> 52:00.358
because there was
no video on demand.

52:00.393 --> 52:04.397
There was no Amazon
Prime or Vimeo

52:04.431 --> 52:07.400
so people couldn't
find these things.

52:07.434 --> 52:08.849
They had to exchange them.

52:10.023 --> 52:11.542
It's kind of creepy
if you think about it,

52:11.576 --> 52:16.581
it's like a dark web of
inappropriate VHS movies,

52:17.962 --> 52:22.587
but I think that it really
built up independent film-making

52:24.382 --> 52:27.316
in a big way and
I personally feel

52:29.284 --> 52:30.940
without some of
the video nasties

52:30.975 --> 52:35.980
and how they were
exchanged almost illegally

52:37.119 --> 52:38.810
or illegally in some
countries, some states.

52:39.984 --> 52:42.089
I think without that
you wouldn't have seen

52:42.124 --> 52:45.955
such a surge of
independent film makers

52:45.990 --> 52:50.581
who later did move on to the
Hollywood level in the 90s.

52:50.615 --> 52:53.722
You saw a lot of
people get their start

52:53.756 --> 52:55.206
working on these movies

52:55.241 --> 52:59.762
that it was so shocking
everybody wanted to see it.

53:00.936 --> 53:03.835
It had either the
insane gore effects

53:03.870 --> 53:07.736
or a sex scene that
was crazy for its time.

53:08.875 --> 53:11.360
You know very low budget stuff

53:11.395 --> 53:14.881
and personally the last
couple of movies I've done

53:14.915 --> 53:18.056
such as Witchhunt
and Parts Unknown,

53:18.091 --> 53:23.096
I think I've modeled a
lot of what I've done

53:24.511 --> 53:26.789
as a director around some of
these so-called video nasties.

53:26.824 --> 53:30.345
Because they were shot
on much smaller budgets.

53:32.036 --> 53:35.177
I think the budget wasn't
what was important.

53:36.074 --> 53:38.836
It was what was accomplished.

53:38.870 --> 53:43.875
And what was accomplished
was creating almost this

53:46.706 --> 53:49.985
taboo situation where you can go

53:50.019 --> 53:51.780
and watch one of these things.

53:51.814 --> 53:53.782
You weren't seeing in a theater.

53:54.886 --> 53:56.716
They were hard to find,
hard to track down

53:56.750 --> 53:58.890
and you had something
that somebody didn't.

54:00.306 --> 54:02.342
It wasn't just because it
was hard-to-get movie either.

54:02.377 --> 54:05.552
It was because it actually had

54:05.587 --> 54:07.209
the sex scene and violence in it

54:08.383 --> 54:09.591
and the good stuff that I think

54:09.625 --> 54:11.524
sometimes we don't
get to see anymore.

54:12.973 --> 54:17.461
As our society changes and
becomes a little bit more PC

54:17.495 --> 54:22.155
and we're not allowed
to show stuff in film,

54:22.189 --> 54:25.883
I think there's gonna be a
big someday a big resurgence

54:25.917 --> 54:28.955
in this underground film making.

54:28.989 --> 54:33.718
And a way to bring this
back for fans of this genre,

54:34.788 --> 54:36.342
I'd say anyone watching
his is probably

54:36.376 --> 54:37.653
a fan of this genre,

54:39.034 --> 54:43.280
is to go and support the
local horror conventions

54:43.314 --> 54:46.490
and some of the local
people that set up shop

54:46.524 --> 54:48.561
at these small events.

54:48.595 --> 54:51.874
Because they're the ones
selling the stuff now.

54:53.324 --> 54:55.844
The Amazon Primes and all
that stuff, that's cool,

54:55.878 --> 54:58.191
but what you're
gonna see on there

54:58.225 --> 54:59.675
and Netflix and all
that is probably

54:59.710 --> 55:01.332
more of what you've
already seen.

55:02.471 --> 55:05.957
So hopefully someday
we get to back to this,

55:05.992 --> 55:08.857
it might not be VHS,
it might be on Blu-Ray

55:12.067 --> 55:15.864
or even digital, but
someday I hope there's a way

55:15.898 --> 55:17.452
to kind of trade
these movies again.

55:17.486 --> 55:21.559
I think it got a lot
of people their start.

55:21.594 --> 55:23.458
It found a lot of fans.

55:25.874 --> 55:29.360
That's kind of my feeling
about the importance

55:29.395 --> 55:33.053
of the so-called video nasties

55:33.088 --> 55:35.193
and what they did
for people like me

55:36.367 --> 55:41.027
who make low budget material.

55:41.061 --> 55:43.478
- I got into video nasties

55:43.512 --> 55:46.239
as around it might be
around '98, '99 time

55:46.619 --> 55:48.655
when they were still banned,
but it was right before

55:48.690 --> 55:50.519
James Furman left the BBFC.

55:53.936 --> 55:57.388
All these films started
to become unbanned

55:57.423 --> 56:00.736
and were starting to get
certificates and stuff.

56:00.771 --> 56:03.221
So I got into the
video nasties at a time

56:03.256 --> 56:06.224
when they were still
banned and then I saw

56:06.259 --> 56:10.505
the point when they
started to get re-released.

56:12.817 --> 56:14.405
When they were still
banned I remember

56:14.440 --> 56:17.512
my other school and
a friend of mine

56:17.546 --> 56:20.204
I'd always had an
interest in horror films

56:20.238 --> 56:22.448
and extreme films
so the video nasties

56:22.482 --> 56:24.242
were something that
always fascinated me.

56:25.658 --> 56:28.626
That idea these films
that you shouldn't watch,

56:28.661 --> 56:32.147
that they've been banned
somehow dangerous or whatever,

56:32.181 --> 56:35.426
if you watched them they
could be disturbing to you

56:35.461 --> 56:36.807
and say that when
you were at school,

56:36.841 --> 56:40.189
that just makes you want
to find all these films.

56:40.224 --> 56:44.090
At that time a friend of
mine he came across an advert

56:44.124 --> 56:47.265
on the back Darling Free
Ads newspaper magazine,

56:47.300 --> 56:48.853
if anybody remembers that.

56:48.888 --> 56:51.580
Someone was sending
copies of The Exorcist.

56:51.615 --> 56:54.480
Then he asked about nasties,
if he had any other tapes

56:56.482 --> 56:59.450
and he had a whole
list, he had pretty much

56:59.485 --> 57:00.693
the whole video nasties.

57:00.727 --> 57:04.800
He had loads of obscure,
cult hard-to-find films.

57:08.183 --> 57:10.806
That's where I basically
started seeing these things.

57:10.841 --> 57:14.258
We would spend I think he
used to do two for 10 quid

57:14.292 --> 57:16.985
or two for 15 pounds, he'd
put two films into one tape

57:18.435 --> 57:19.884
I used to start buying those,

57:19.919 --> 57:23.474
I think all of them from laser
discs or pre-seller copies.

57:23.509 --> 57:25.925
My first experience
to the video nasties

57:25.959 --> 57:27.789
was just all through
bootleg copies.

57:27.823 --> 57:29.307
But his ones were
really good quality.

57:29.342 --> 57:32.725
I remember a friend who also
had another guy selling them.

57:32.759 --> 57:36.280
And they were fifth, sixth,
seventh generation copies

57:36.314 --> 57:37.730
and they were
almost unwatchable,

57:37.764 --> 57:41.837
but this guy from the
Darling Free Ads magazine,

57:41.872 --> 57:43.805
his stuff was always
like amazing quality.

57:43.839 --> 57:45.945
I think they were all from
laser discs he got them.

57:48.395 --> 57:51.537
Then around that time
I actually started

57:51.571 --> 57:53.780
making bootlegs as
well to sell on eBay.

57:53.815 --> 57:55.230
Like I said at the time
this is when they were

57:55.264 --> 57:56.645
still banned and you
couldn't get them

57:56.680 --> 57:58.198
so I used to make copies.

57:59.717 --> 58:01.512
Used to get four-hour
tapes and put two films

58:01.547 --> 58:02.996
that were kind of
connected one tape

58:03.031 --> 58:05.171
and stick them on eBay and
send them for like 10 pound,

58:05.205 --> 58:08.450
15 pound a pop each time.

58:08.485 --> 58:11.488
Stuff like Cannibal
Holocaust and Cannibal Ferox
would go onto one tape.

58:11.522 --> 58:13.662
I Spit On Your Grave and
Last House on the Left

58:13.697 --> 58:14.905
would go on another tape.

58:14.939 --> 58:16.700
Occasionally you'd get
bootlegs from people

58:16.734 --> 58:18.805
saying they didn't realize
they were buying bootlegs

58:18.840 --> 58:21.532
and your account
would be closed down.

58:21.567 --> 58:24.742
- So did I ever own any
bootlegs of the video nasties?

58:24.777 --> 58:28.263
God yes, I tell you, this
is a really great story.

58:28.297 --> 58:31.611
In about '96, '97, this
is before the Internet

58:31.646 --> 58:34.511
was really big, e-mail
might have been used

58:34.545 --> 58:35.995
by some people that I knew.

58:36.029 --> 58:41.034
But in '96 to '97 I
started doing mail trading

58:42.208 --> 58:45.452
of movies on VHS where
we would send dupes.

58:47.213 --> 58:49.664
Through e-mail you would
make contacts with people.

58:49.698 --> 58:52.287
I guess they did have
websites up which is really

58:52.321 --> 58:55.083
how you would find people,
but they were into trades,

58:55.117 --> 58:56.947
so somebody would
have their list

58:56.981 --> 58:58.535
of what movies they had

58:58.569 --> 59:01.330
and you would have a list
of what movies you had
and we would swap lists.

59:01.365 --> 59:02.573
And of course we'd make a deal.

59:02.608 --> 59:04.679
You say well geez,
I would really love

59:04.713 --> 59:05.680
to get this, this and this

59:05.714 --> 59:07.164
and then the guy
on the other end

59:07.198 --> 59:09.062
would pick same amount
of movies from your list.

59:09.097 --> 59:13.170
You would make the copies if
you were a reputable trader,

59:13.204 --> 59:14.585
you would buy brand
new video tapes

59:14.620 --> 59:16.138
and make the copies onto those.

59:16.173 --> 59:18.382
I guess some people might
have used previously used

59:18.416 --> 59:20.453
blank tapes, which was the

59:20.487 --> 59:21.834
shittiest thing to
do for somebody.

59:21.868 --> 59:24.043
But anyway you're
buy blank tapes,

59:24.077 --> 59:25.976
copy the movie you
had, so you're making

59:26.010 --> 59:28.668
your third or fourth
generation movie

59:28.703 --> 59:31.257
onto a fifth or sixth
generation movie

59:31.291 --> 59:33.880
because everybody is trading
a dupe of a dupe of a dupe

59:33.915 --> 59:35.986
and then you mail
them in the mail.

59:36.020 --> 59:37.815
Well this went on for
me for a few years

59:37.850 --> 59:41.819
and I got so many movies
through the mail trading.

59:41.854 --> 59:44.339
Cannibal Holocaust,
Cannibal Ferox,

59:44.373 --> 59:46.168
Beyond the Darkness,
I got that one.

59:46.203 --> 59:49.206
I got everything you see,
uncut Friday the 13th Part One.

59:49.240 --> 59:54.245
These were all the movies that
were not on DVD at all yet.

59:55.592 --> 59:57.283
They were not being
re-released and remastered.

59:57.317 --> 59:59.941
They were still on
very ropey old tapes.

59:59.975 --> 1:00:03.151
Another company I'm aware of
was of course Midnight Video.

1:00:03.185 --> 1:00:04.635
They were selling
it at the time.

1:00:04.670 --> 1:00:06.913
A lot of people I
knew had that movie

1:00:06.948 --> 1:00:08.674
or Midnight movie tapes

1:00:08.708 --> 1:00:10.779
and they were making
dupes of that to trade.

1:00:10.814 --> 1:00:12.781
So I got Anthropothigast
and stuff

1:00:13.886 --> 1:00:17.199
and the Midnight
Video Anthropothigast

1:00:17.234 --> 1:00:18.684
was made up of
different sources.

1:00:18.718 --> 1:00:21.790
So when it came to
see George Eastman

1:00:21.825 --> 1:00:25.173
reach into the woman and
pull out the fetus to eat her

1:00:25.207 --> 1:00:26.933
that particular piece of footage

1:00:26.968 --> 1:00:30.178
was coming in this
very, very washed out

1:00:30.212 --> 1:00:32.870
blurry piece of video
and then would cut out

1:00:32.905 --> 1:00:34.872
sort of washed out
video where you saw

1:00:34.907 --> 1:00:36.080
the rest of the movie.

1:00:36.115 --> 1:00:38.531
So you had different
composites put together.

1:00:38.565 --> 1:00:40.671
- So yeah, I remember
when I was a kid,

1:00:40.706 --> 1:00:45.642
the one in the United States
everybody wanted to see

1:00:49.093 --> 1:00:51.578
Faces of Death, that
was the big thing.

1:00:51.613 --> 1:00:56.169
If you had a VHS of Faces of
Death, you were like a king.

1:00:56.204 --> 1:00:58.655
You'd go into a party
and be like hey,

1:00:58.689 --> 1:01:03.383
I bought this off of
some dude on the street

1:01:04.799 --> 1:01:07.871
and everybody would gather
around the TV and watch this

1:01:07.905 --> 1:01:10.701
I have no idea if that's
actually real or not.

1:01:10.736 --> 1:01:11.737
I feel like it's mixed.

1:01:11.771 --> 1:01:16.776
It was just that
suspense I think

1:01:18.191 --> 1:01:20.607
really paved the way for
things like The Blair Witch,

1:01:20.642 --> 1:01:25.129
the found footage films
that excitement of

1:01:26.579 --> 1:01:30.721
I'm seeing something that's
nobody supposed to see.

1:01:32.550 --> 1:01:36.244
I think it really captured
what independent film

1:01:36.278 --> 1:01:41.283
is supposed to be and not
a system of Hollywood B

1:01:42.422 --> 1:01:46.910
which is what we tend
to get on a lot of
the video-on-demand services.

1:01:46.944 --> 1:01:49.015
- One of the next
things that I have here

1:01:50.568 --> 1:01:52.985
is actually bootleg
copy of Tenebrae.

1:01:53.019 --> 1:01:57.334
This was a copy of the Video
Media release as you can see,

1:01:57.368 --> 1:02:00.786
but it's a totally
photocopied cover art.

1:02:01.925 --> 1:02:03.892
And also something
interesting about it,

1:02:03.927 --> 1:02:05.376
you can see here
maybe is that it's got

1:02:05.411 --> 1:02:08.517
the British rating on it
instead of the American one.

1:02:08.552 --> 1:02:10.243
It's sort of all
over the place here,

1:02:10.278 --> 1:02:13.488
but this is the way
I first saw the film.

1:02:13.522 --> 1:02:16.180
It's what interested me to not
only Dario Argento's movies,

1:02:16.215 --> 1:02:18.010
but Italian movies as well.

1:02:19.183 --> 1:02:20.771
That seen at the
end with the girl

1:02:20.806 --> 1:02:22.083
that gets her arm chopped off

1:02:22.117 --> 1:02:23.843
and sprays blood
all over the wall

1:02:23.878 --> 1:02:25.396
was sort of life changing for me

1:02:25.431 --> 1:02:28.537
because that's the moment
I realized horror was art.

1:02:29.953 --> 1:02:32.610
This movie will always stand
out to me for that reason.

1:02:32.645 --> 1:02:34.716
Even though this
is a bootleg copy

1:02:34.751 --> 1:02:37.305
and I of course have better
versions of this to watch

1:02:37.339 --> 1:02:38.996
I'm always gonna hold onto this,

1:02:39.031 --> 1:02:40.791
because this is what started
my love for Italian horror,

1:02:40.826 --> 1:02:43.587
this very bootleg
release of Tenebrae.

1:02:43.621 --> 1:02:46.141
- I did own one banned film.

1:02:46.176 --> 1:02:47.902
I remember in
Melbourne, Victoria,

1:02:47.936 --> 1:02:49.489
there weren't a lot
of films banned.

1:02:49.524 --> 1:02:51.112
I mean the Driller Killer was.

1:02:51.146 --> 1:02:53.321
I think Silent Night,
Deadly Night perhaps.

1:02:53.355 --> 1:02:55.806
Some of these films
you could into state.

1:02:57.014 --> 1:02:59.534
I remember a friend
of mine came to me
knowing how much I adored horror

1:02:59.568 --> 1:03:01.812
and he'd been to the
States and he picked me up

1:03:01.847 --> 1:03:04.332
a copy of The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre 2,

1:03:04.366 --> 1:03:05.851
and I remember that was banned.

1:03:05.885 --> 1:03:09.544
I was the only guy I knew
that had this video tape,

1:03:09.578 --> 1:03:12.098
and so attracted a lot of
friends to come and watch it.

1:03:12.133 --> 1:03:13.686
And that was a banned film,

1:03:13.720 --> 1:03:15.136
so that was probably
one of the only ones

1:03:15.170 --> 1:03:18.587
that I really owned at the
time that did have the stigma.

1:03:18.622 --> 1:03:21.349
- I did own a lot of bootleg
because I was on a quest

1:03:21.383 --> 1:03:24.179
to try and own all
of the video nasties,

1:03:24.214 --> 1:03:27.493
so I literally did
own, I still do now

1:03:27.527 --> 1:03:30.565
so I've got a lot of bootleg
copies of stuff like that.

1:03:30.599 --> 1:03:33.879
I had these tapes and it
was stuck on the side,

1:03:33.913 --> 1:03:37.883
hand written Driller Killer
and stuff like that on there.

1:03:37.917 --> 1:03:42.370
- Yes, I owned several bootlegs
actually of these movies.

1:03:42.404 --> 1:03:45.649
Growing up back then, they
weren't that accessible.

1:03:45.683 --> 1:03:47.754
You couldn't just
walk into a Best Buy

1:03:47.789 --> 1:03:50.723
if you wanted to buy
a movie like this.

1:03:50.757 --> 1:03:52.932
You had to track them down.

1:03:52.967 --> 1:03:54.520
You had to do your research.

1:03:54.554 --> 1:03:58.110
Usually, they were second,
third, fourth generation copies.

1:03:58.144 --> 1:04:01.147
They were squiggly and
grainy and looked like crap

1:04:01.182 --> 1:04:04.737
and you could barely tell
what was happening sometimes.

1:04:04.771 --> 1:04:06.428
It was in a lot of
ways really cool

1:04:06.463 --> 1:04:07.844
because you knew that this

1:04:07.878 --> 1:04:09.328
was the only way
to see the movie.

1:04:09.362 --> 1:04:11.123
You were seeing something
that not everybody else saw.

1:04:11.157 --> 1:04:13.884
- So they were a bit
thing, the bootleg copies,

1:04:13.919 --> 1:04:15.092
because they were
just going around.

1:04:15.127 --> 1:04:17.336
I mean when I was a
kid in teenage years,

1:04:17.370 --> 1:04:18.578
it was bootleg copies.

1:04:18.613 --> 1:04:21.409
You never saw a real
copy of a video nasty.

1:04:21.443 --> 1:04:26.172
So from about '85 to
about 2000 or even 2001,

1:04:26.207 --> 1:04:28.554
you had these bootleg VHS copies

1:04:28.588 --> 1:04:31.729
and bootleg DVD
copies in circulation.

1:04:31.764 --> 1:04:33.386
So you're watching these,
sometimes it was like

1:04:33.421 --> 1:04:35.388
a fifth generation bootleg

1:04:35.423 --> 1:04:37.459
of The Texas Chainsaw
Massacre you were watching

1:04:37.494 --> 1:04:39.358
or something like that.

1:04:39.392 --> 1:04:42.430
- It's funny because it's given
me a really high tolerance

1:04:42.464 --> 1:04:45.019
for low-quality transfers

1:04:45.053 --> 1:04:46.158
because I just grew up watching

1:04:46.192 --> 1:04:47.469
a whole lot of bootleg movies.

1:04:47.504 --> 1:04:49.368
Nowadays it doesn't bother me.

1:04:49.402 --> 1:04:52.612
I can watch really
horrible stuff on YouTube
and I don't blink an eye.

1:04:52.647 --> 1:04:54.373
It's part of growing up
watching those bootlegs

1:04:54.407 --> 1:04:57.410
and it's still sort of exciting
if I'm at a flea market now

1:04:57.445 --> 1:04:59.896
or garage sale and I find a
bootleg of an old horror movie,

1:04:59.930 --> 1:05:01.621
I definitely snatch it up.

1:05:01.656 --> 1:05:02.553
It's nostalgic.

1:05:02.588 --> 1:05:04.038
It's really cool and unique

1:05:04.072 --> 1:05:06.626
and it's exciting to watch
a movie like that sometimes.

1:05:06.661 --> 1:05:09.181
It adds a lot to the
mystique of the movie.

1:05:12.529 --> 1:05:13.979
- [Announcer] See Abel
Ferrera as Reno Miller,

1:05:15.083 --> 1:05:16.498
a man driven to the very edge.

1:05:17.637 --> 1:05:19.812
[moaning]

1:05:22.194 --> 1:05:24.023
And then beyond.

1:05:24.058 --> 1:05:29.063
[drill rattling]
[screaming]

1:05:35.138 --> 1:05:36.587
The Driller Killer is coming.

1:05:38.106 --> 1:05:39.280
- The Driller Killer
when it came out

1:05:39.314 --> 1:05:40.971
I remember was a very
controversial film

1:05:41.006 --> 1:05:43.905
because they had all this
rumor going on at the time

1:05:43.940 --> 1:05:46.183
that when Abel
Ferrara made the film

1:05:46.218 --> 1:05:48.668
and starred in it
that he was actually
killing down and outs.

1:05:48.703 --> 1:05:51.016
Because the people in the film

1:05:51.050 --> 1:05:52.845
really looked like
down and outs.

1:05:52.879 --> 1:05:54.467
Some of them probably
were and they were paid

1:05:54.502 --> 1:05:56.883
a few dollars to become
part of this movie.

1:05:58.161 --> 1:06:00.542
I always found that
very disturbing

1:06:00.577 --> 1:06:03.580
for years after seeing it
and then experiencing again

1:06:03.614 --> 1:06:05.962
over the years and the decades.

1:06:05.996 --> 1:06:08.516
I've still found it a
very troubling film.

1:06:08.550 --> 1:06:12.278
I think because it's incredibly
realistic on one aspect

1:06:12.313 --> 1:06:14.004
and a little over
the top in others

1:06:14.039 --> 1:06:16.041
in terms of the performance.

1:06:16.075 --> 1:06:17.214
The performance of
Abel Ferrara himself

1:06:17.249 --> 1:06:20.769
it's mixed, it's
very strong at times.

1:06:20.804 --> 1:06:24.049
And then it's so wild it's
like do I quite believe that?

1:06:24.083 --> 1:06:27.328
But it was shot in
such a lurid style

1:06:27.362 --> 1:06:28.950
that you couldn't
help be sucked into

1:06:28.985 --> 1:06:31.953
that grimy, horrible underworld.

1:06:31.988 --> 1:06:34.024
And then when the
murders you were like

1:06:34.059 --> 1:06:37.234
oh my God, is this
happening for real?

1:06:37.269 --> 1:06:40.893
So in a way, even though
it's not found footage,

1:06:40.927 --> 1:06:43.965
it kind of feels like a
mockumentary-style film,

1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:47.141
which would have been one
of the first of that kind.

1:06:47.175 --> 1:06:51.041
Driller Killer is a film
that's always stayed with me

1:06:51.076 --> 1:06:55.011
for its level of violence,
grungy atmosphere

1:06:55.045 --> 1:06:59.981
and general feeling of
dismay and overall horror.

1:07:02.259 --> 1:07:06.160
- [Announcer] Faces of Death,
now a major motion picture.

1:07:06.194 --> 1:07:11.096
- Faces of Death, the
mother of all Mondo movies.

1:07:11.130 --> 1:07:13.167
Oh, where to start
with this one.

1:07:13.201 --> 1:07:15.548
In a nutshell, it's a
documentary about dying.

1:07:16.756 --> 1:07:19.311
It's pretty tame
compared to what

1:07:19.345 --> 1:07:20.795
a lot of people think about it.

1:07:20.829 --> 1:07:22.831
A lot of people think it's
a flat out snuff movie

1:07:22.866 --> 1:07:24.902
where you see real people
getting murdered on video

1:07:24.937 --> 1:07:26.559
and that's not at
all what it is.

1:07:26.594 --> 1:07:30.011
It's got a narrator,
he basically discusses

1:07:30.046 --> 1:07:32.427
the whole cycle of life

1:07:32.462 --> 1:07:36.086
and what really happens
to us when we pass on.

1:07:36.121 --> 1:07:38.537
They examine it throughout
different cultures

1:07:38.571 --> 1:07:40.677
and they look at the
different traditions

1:07:40.711 --> 1:07:45.371
that different people do around
death in their own cultures.

1:07:46.545 --> 1:07:48.892
It's got some pretty
notorious scenes,

1:07:48.926 --> 1:07:51.860
like a man that
is caught on fire.

1:07:53.103 --> 1:07:54.449
I think that the original movie

1:07:54.484 --> 1:07:56.934
is the movie with
the monkey brains.

1:07:58.522 --> 1:08:01.456
There's quite a few scenes
that really make this movie

1:08:01.491 --> 1:08:06.461
stand out, but it's notorious
for being mostly fake.

1:08:06.496 --> 1:08:07.842
A lot of the stuff was staged.

1:08:07.876 --> 1:08:10.569
It's come to light now
throughout various documentaries

1:08:10.603 --> 1:08:12.157
and information on the Internet

1:08:12.191 --> 1:08:16.230
that the re-enacted
a lot of the stuff.

1:08:16.264 --> 1:08:18.646
I think that the
scene that takes place

1:08:18.680 --> 1:08:20.234
in the Middle East
with the monkeys

1:08:20.268 --> 1:08:22.028
was supposed to take place on

1:08:22.063 --> 1:08:24.307
a tradition somewhere in Russia.

1:08:24.341 --> 1:08:26.205
So they changed a lot of things

1:08:26.240 --> 1:08:29.553
to not offend so many cultures
when the movie came out,

1:08:29.588 --> 1:08:32.384
but to me the movie's
just a big spectacle.

1:08:32.418 --> 1:08:36.319
The fear surrounding
the movie with parents,

1:08:36.353 --> 1:08:38.735
the fact that you
couldn't find it anywhere,

1:08:38.769 --> 1:08:40.426
you had to ask
for it some places

1:08:40.461 --> 1:08:41.841
or it was in a special section

1:08:41.876 --> 1:08:44.637
with the other death
movies or pornography even.

1:08:44.672 --> 1:08:46.536
You had to be 18 to get it.

1:08:46.570 --> 1:08:48.814
That always really
appealed to me

1:08:48.848 --> 1:08:50.091
and made the movie
probably more exciting

1:08:50.126 --> 1:08:52.231
than it is to watch,
because like I said

1:08:52.266 --> 1:08:55.510
it's a pretty by-the-number
70s documentary.

1:08:55.545 --> 1:08:57.063
It's just focused on death.

1:08:57.098 --> 1:08:58.824
I think that even today
it's the type of thing

1:08:58.858 --> 1:09:01.758
you could probably show
to a high school class

1:09:01.792 --> 1:09:03.380
and nobody would bat an eye.

1:09:03.415 --> 1:09:04.657
Everybody would
be on their phones

1:09:04.692 --> 1:09:06.832
watching stuff more
extreme on YouTube.

1:09:06.866 --> 1:09:09.075
It's funny because those movies

1:09:09.110 --> 1:09:11.077
will stick out and
be the most extreme,

1:09:11.112 --> 1:09:15.289
but by today's standards
they're almost a joke.

1:09:15.323 --> 1:09:19.638
I think that that whole
series really stands out

1:09:19.672 --> 1:09:21.950
against the other video nasties

1:09:21.985 --> 1:09:24.160
just because it's
sort of the real deal

1:09:24.194 --> 1:09:27.611
and it was the first of
its kind when it came out.

1:09:27.646 --> 1:09:29.406
- I remember another
series of video nasties

1:09:29.441 --> 1:09:33.893
which was quite horrific at
the time to be quite frank.

1:09:33.928 --> 1:09:36.586
Faces of Death, do
you remember those?

1:09:36.620 --> 1:09:38.588
It was a series of
films, video films

1:09:38.622 --> 1:09:40.486
with apparently
people actually dying.

1:09:40.521 --> 1:09:42.074
Well I wouldn't want
to watch them now

1:09:42.108 --> 1:09:43.282
and it actually turns me stomach

1:09:43.317 --> 1:09:45.284
to think I watched
them back then.

1:09:45.319 --> 1:09:46.734
But there was one
that I remember

1:09:46.768 --> 1:09:49.426
and it was a chap
in a gas chamber

1:09:49.461 --> 1:09:51.842
and you actually had the
cameraman in the gas chamber.

1:09:51.877 --> 1:09:54.328
Even as a kid I thought hold
on, this can't be right.

1:09:54.362 --> 1:09:56.985
Then it turned out most
of them were faked.

1:09:57.020 --> 1:09:58.504
Then there was one of a magician

1:09:58.539 --> 1:10:00.541
and mostly goes round and
he's trying to cut himself

1:10:00.575 --> 1:10:02.957
out of something and
these knives come down

1:10:02.991 --> 1:10:04.510
and go into his
head and he dies.

1:10:04.545 --> 1:10:06.995
He's so obviously it was
a rubber head or something

1:10:07.030 --> 1:10:08.963
or plastic or wax head,

1:10:08.997 --> 1:10:12.656
but then you still had some
what still appears to me

1:10:12.691 --> 1:10:14.727
genuine footage of people dying.

1:10:14.762 --> 1:10:16.591
THere's one terrible
scene where a chap

1:10:16.626 --> 1:10:18.835
gets out of a car in
Africa or somewhere

1:10:18.869 --> 1:10:20.492
and he's filming this lioness.

1:10:20.526 --> 1:10:23.357
They cut to actually him
filming it on this teeny camera

1:10:23.391 --> 1:10:26.601
and then this other lion
comes up from behind him

1:10:26.636 --> 1:10:28.569
and attacks him and kills him.

1:10:28.603 --> 1:10:31.088
All the people are screaming

1:10:31.123 --> 1:10:32.262
and they have the footage of him

1:10:32.297 --> 1:10:34.368
being put in a
car in a body bag.

1:10:34.402 --> 1:10:35.886
So that was pretty horrific.

1:10:35.921 --> 1:10:37.509
I wouldn't want to watch
them again I didn't think.

1:10:37.543 --> 1:10:39.235
- Some of the
sickest video nasty,

1:10:39.269 --> 1:10:42.307
I would say the craziest,
goriest, sickest one

1:10:42.341 --> 1:10:45.102
out of the whole lot
would be Faces of Death.

1:10:45.137 --> 1:10:47.760
[droning music]

1:10:49.210 --> 1:10:50.418
- [Announcer] Now a
motion picture dares

1:10:50.453 --> 1:10:52.282
to take you beyond the
threshold of the living

1:10:52.317 --> 1:10:55.527
where you may discover
your own face of death.

1:10:56.769 --> 1:10:59.324
- I think that film
is really sick.

1:10:59.358 --> 1:11:01.153
I mean there's actually,
is there real killings

1:11:01.187 --> 1:11:02.396
in that film or not?

1:11:02.430 --> 1:11:04.294
I don't know because
I've never actually

1:11:04.329 --> 1:11:06.020
got the whole way through it.

1:11:06.054 --> 1:11:08.885
I've put it on before, but
it actually turns my stomach.

1:11:08.919 --> 1:11:10.369
There was that big
thing in the 80s

1:11:10.404 --> 1:11:13.027
where they were deemed to
be eating monkey brains

1:11:13.061 --> 1:11:15.063
and we've got prime
ministers, MPs,

1:11:15.098 --> 1:11:18.239
saying they're eating monkey
brains for God sake in that.

1:11:18.274 --> 1:11:19.482
They weren't.

1:11:19.516 --> 1:11:21.967
It was all fake anyway,
which was totally crazy.

1:11:22.001 --> 1:11:25.626
But Faces of Death has to be
the sickest, craziest film.

1:11:25.660 --> 1:11:27.628
I think the film
that you'd crown

1:11:27.662 --> 1:11:32.115
the king of the video nasty
would be I Spit On Your Grave.

1:11:32.149 --> 1:11:35.360
That poster art, that
whole cover is synonymous

1:11:35.394 --> 1:11:39.571
of being the queen,
king of the video nasty.

1:11:39.605 --> 1:11:41.952
It's such an amazing film.

1:11:41.987 --> 1:11:43.195
It's really brilliant.

1:11:43.229 --> 1:11:45.680
- Faces of Death
was actually created

1:11:45.715 --> 1:11:47.682
for the Japanese film market.

1:11:47.717 --> 1:11:49.063
It was a movie called Junk.

1:11:49.097 --> 1:11:50.582
It was released there that way.

1:11:52.100 --> 1:11:55.587
They tested it with American
audiences and it caught on,

1:11:55.621 --> 1:11:57.105
so they dropped it on home video

1:11:57.140 --> 1:11:59.142
and it ended up becoming a
really popular American series

1:11:59.176 --> 1:12:00.488
known as Faces of Death.

1:12:01.627 --> 1:12:02.801
A lot of people also don't know

1:12:02.835 --> 1:12:04.975
is that almost every
installment of the film

1:12:05.010 --> 1:12:08.600
was released in a different
version in other countries.

1:12:08.634 --> 1:12:11.085
Notoriously Faces of Death 3,

1:12:11.119 --> 1:12:12.362
it's not actually on the list,

1:12:12.397 --> 1:12:14.122
but it's a sequel
to the original.

1:12:14.157 --> 1:12:18.403
That was released as Fear
in most parts of Europe

1:12:18.437 --> 1:12:20.266
and it had a completely
different narrator,

1:12:20.301 --> 1:12:23.200
totally different scenes, it
was edited completely different

1:12:23.235 --> 1:12:24.443
and in some ways
it's a lot better

1:12:24.478 --> 1:12:28.033
than the American
version that came out.

1:12:28.067 --> 1:12:30.932
Of course there's several
versions that were released

1:12:30.967 --> 1:12:32.796
of Last House on the Left.

1:12:32.831 --> 1:12:35.730
America first got
the R-rated version

1:12:35.765 --> 1:12:37.214
when it came out to theaters,

1:12:37.249 --> 1:12:39.769
but then we did eventually
get the uncut version

1:12:39.803 --> 1:12:41.978
on home video even
though it was missing

1:12:42.012 --> 1:12:44.946
a lot of the gore that
Wes Craven had shot.

1:12:44.981 --> 1:12:46.465
It was still a little bit longer

1:12:46.500 --> 1:12:49.330
than what the UK
got for example.

1:12:50.538 --> 1:12:54.439
- Definitely Faces of
Death would have to be

1:12:54.473 --> 1:12:57.442
the most sadistic I mean
when I first heard the name,

1:12:57.476 --> 1:13:01.756
it was almost like
this taboo Fear Factor.

1:13:01.791 --> 1:13:04.172
Someone would say Faces of
Death, have you seen it?

1:13:04.207 --> 1:13:06.347
And people would go
no, don't watch that.

1:13:06.382 --> 1:13:08.004
It's supposed to be terrifying.

1:13:08.038 --> 1:13:10.420
I think because you know
it's really a documentary.

1:13:10.455 --> 1:13:14.010
And it was the
first video footage

1:13:14.044 --> 1:13:15.460
that came out in the 80s

1:13:15.494 --> 1:13:18.394
where apparently you could
see these real deaths.

1:13:18.428 --> 1:13:21.500
Of course there was skepticism.

1:13:21.535 --> 1:13:23.399
Some people thought they
were staged and whatnot,

1:13:23.433 --> 1:13:26.505
but Faces of Death at
least where I was living,

1:13:26.540 --> 1:13:29.957
that was supposed to
be the most scariest

1:13:29.991 --> 1:13:34.996
and the most taboo so just based
on the reputation of those.

1:13:35.445 --> 1:13:37.827
There was a whole spawn of
documentaries that came out.

1:13:37.861 --> 1:13:40.312
I remember there was
Savage Man, Savage Beast,

1:13:40.346 --> 1:13:43.453
Shocking Asia and there
was Being Different.

1:13:43.488 --> 1:13:46.767
There was The Killing
of America, there
was this whole range

1:13:46.801 --> 1:13:48.320
Savage Man, Savage Beast.

1:13:48.354 --> 1:13:50.736
So it was really
appeared in the 80s

1:13:50.771 --> 1:13:54.844
where I guess horror film
became sort of popular.

1:13:54.878 --> 1:13:57.812
Then they went into
documentary stream.

1:13:57.847 --> 1:14:00.505
It almost like trying
to find the scariest

1:14:00.539 --> 1:14:05.544
or trying to find the most
impact with the gore factor.

1:14:06.442 --> 1:14:07.857
That's what people were after.

1:14:07.891 --> 1:14:09.375
It was almost those people
that had an obsession

1:14:09.410 --> 1:14:11.930
and they wanted to get
as nasty as they could.

1:14:11.964 --> 1:14:14.035
And of course now
everything is reality TV.

1:14:14.070 --> 1:14:15.451
So even documentaries back then

1:14:15.485 --> 1:14:17.556
I think they were
onto something.

1:14:17.591 --> 1:14:21.111
- One of the most violent
other than Faces of Death

1:14:21.146 --> 1:14:23.700
in the video nasties would
probably be Cannibal Holocaust.

1:14:23.735 --> 1:14:27.117
I mean there's a lot of
violent movies on the list,

1:14:27.152 --> 1:14:28.947
but that's the one that really

1:14:28.981 --> 1:14:30.500
pushed the envelope at the time

1:14:30.535 --> 1:14:33.365
and was notorious for
its graphic nature.

1:14:33.399 --> 1:14:37.507
The impalement through
the woman's anus
and out of her mouth

1:14:37.542 --> 1:14:40.614
is pretty iconic now as
far as horror imagery goes.

1:14:41.718 --> 1:14:43.168
I think that would
probably have to go down

1:14:43.202 --> 1:14:46.240
as probably the most
sickest of the banned films,

1:14:46.274 --> 1:14:48.967
followed closely by movies
like Faces of Death.

1:14:49.001 --> 1:14:51.521
- Every time I watch
it it makes say

1:14:51.556 --> 1:14:54.213
god damn this fucking
movie goes all the way.

1:14:54.248 --> 1:14:57.423
I mean Cryo House Releasing
has the perfect tag line.

1:14:57.458 --> 1:14:59.253
It's the one that
goes all the way.

1:14:59.287 --> 1:15:01.842
But it's a good piece of cinema.

1:15:01.876 --> 1:15:03.671
It's a fucking good movie.

1:15:05.570 --> 1:15:08.089
It deserves to be seen
by a lot more people.

1:15:08.124 --> 1:15:10.160
But I think a lot of
people hear stories

1:15:10.195 --> 1:15:12.887
and of course the
animal torture stuff,

1:15:12.922 --> 1:15:16.235
the animal killings,
it's a tough movie,

1:15:16.270 --> 1:15:21.275
but it deserves to
be on that list.

1:15:24.243 --> 1:15:27.557
It's one that deserved
to be on that list

1:15:27.592 --> 1:15:32.597
as far as being making sure
that young kids don't see it.

1:15:34.184 --> 1:15:37.567
The rape and all that
it's a tough movie.

1:15:37.602 --> 1:15:39.465
- Yeah, I gotta
admit there are films

1:15:39.500 --> 1:15:41.398
on the list of video nasties

1:15:41.433 --> 1:15:44.781
that I really
couldn't watch today.

1:15:44.816 --> 1:15:46.058
- Oh good Lord!

1:15:47.543 --> 1:15:51.477
It's unbelievable,
it's horrible.

1:15:53.065 --> 1:15:55.516
I can't understand the
reason for such cruelty.

1:15:56.931 --> 1:15:59.209
- Cannibal films I have no
interest in watching those.

1:15:59.244 --> 1:16:02.212
I don't like the idea of
innocent people being tortured

1:16:02.247 --> 1:16:04.042
and ripped apart
and eaten alive.

1:16:05.181 --> 1:16:07.459
It's just not something
that appeals to me.

1:16:07.493 --> 1:16:11.774
- I wouldn't say that there's
any films I couldn't stomach,

1:16:11.808 --> 1:16:14.708
but perhaps there's
scenes I can't stomach.

1:16:15.709 --> 1:16:17.365
I've noticed as I get older

1:16:17.400 --> 1:16:18.988
it's just getting
increasingly harder

1:16:19.022 --> 1:16:20.955
for me to be able to keep
my eyes on the screen

1:16:20.990 --> 1:16:22.578
during the excessive gore.

1:16:23.717 --> 1:16:28.687
In particular, the scene
in Cannibal Holocaust

1:16:29.826 --> 1:16:32.588
where it shows
the woman impaled.

1:16:32.622 --> 1:16:34.244
That's pretty hard to look at.

1:16:35.487 --> 1:16:38.628
Obviously being a
guy, the scene in

1:16:38.663 --> 1:16:43.633
I Spit On Your Grave where
she takes the guy's manhood.

1:16:44.738 --> 1:16:45.842
It doesn't actually
show anything,

1:16:45.877 --> 1:16:47.361
but that's definitely something

1:16:47.395 --> 1:16:51.365
that is very hard
as a guy to watch.

1:16:52.642 --> 1:16:56.577
And also in Zombie
Flesh Eaters of course

1:16:56.612 --> 1:16:58.406
the notorious scene
with the eyeball,

1:16:58.441 --> 1:16:59.925
this split in the eyeball.

1:16:59.960 --> 1:17:02.583
I don't know how anybody
can watch that scene

1:17:02.618 --> 1:17:04.136
without covering their eyes,

1:17:04.171 --> 1:17:06.518
because it's just it's torture

1:17:06.552 --> 1:17:08.865
as her eye gets closer
and closer and closer

1:17:08.900 --> 1:17:11.040
to that splinter,
it's like oh my God,

1:17:11.074 --> 1:17:13.007
turn your head
what are you doing?

1:17:13.042 --> 1:17:14.284
It's very hard to watch.

1:17:14.319 --> 1:17:16.114
And then it pierces
and it's disgusting

1:17:16.148 --> 1:17:18.530
and in typical
Lucio Fulci fashion,

1:17:18.564 --> 1:17:20.566
it doesn't cut away right away.

1:17:20.601 --> 1:17:23.293
So it's very hard to watch,

1:17:23.328 --> 1:17:25.019
but it's still an
enjoyable movie.

1:17:25.054 --> 1:17:27.332
All of these movies
are really enjoyable,

1:17:27.366 --> 1:17:29.679
even if I have to cover my
eyes through parts of them.

1:17:30.576 --> 1:17:32.509
- No, I wish there was.

1:17:32.544 --> 1:17:34.684
I mentioned Cannibal Holocaust,

1:17:34.719 --> 1:17:38.412
but I mean like I said I
got desensitized to it.

1:17:38.446 --> 1:17:42.899
But there's really nothing
that does it to me anymore.

1:17:42.934 --> 1:17:46.006
So no, I wish there was though.

1:17:46.040 --> 1:17:48.836
I wish I was and I say it a lot

1:17:48.871 --> 1:17:51.045
because I know some of
these films I could mention

1:17:51.080 --> 1:17:56.085
like having friends seeing I
would envy that feeling again.

1:17:56.948 --> 1:17:58.432
But I just don't get it anymore.

1:17:59.605 --> 1:18:01.400
- I think a film I
couldn't stand like

1:18:01.435 --> 1:18:03.748
it has to be Faces of Death
is one I couldn't stand,

1:18:03.782 --> 1:18:08.614
but Cannibal Holocaust watching
that film turned my stomach.

1:18:08.649 --> 1:18:10.616
It's such a good horror film.

1:18:10.651 --> 1:18:12.791
It's a great video nasty
and a great horror film,

1:18:12.826 --> 1:18:14.897
but it actually
turns my stomach.

1:18:14.931 --> 1:18:17.485
There's a scene in there
where they're killing a turtle

1:18:17.520 --> 1:18:20.799
and it just makes me even
now I'll put that on,

1:18:20.834 --> 1:18:23.319
I will retch, my
stomach will turn

1:18:23.353 --> 1:18:25.424
when it comes to that scene.

1:18:25.459 --> 1:18:28.738
So yeah I think Cannibal
Holocaust and Faces of Death

1:18:28.773 --> 1:18:31.810
even now they make me feel
queasy even thinking about them.

1:18:31.845 --> 1:18:36.228
Both really amazing films,
but really, really sick.

1:18:36.263 --> 1:18:38.506
- I think Cannibal Holocaust,

1:18:38.541 --> 1:18:42.683
a friend of mine had
a re-release on DVD

1:18:42.718 --> 1:18:45.237
and he put it on
and I was like okay,

1:18:45.272 --> 1:18:47.446
we'll go back there,
we'll have a look.

1:18:47.481 --> 1:18:48.689
But I really just felt sick.

1:18:48.724 --> 1:18:51.036
I was kind of not
really probably now

1:18:51.071 --> 1:18:52.831
being a grown man,
it wasn't scary.

1:18:52.866 --> 1:18:54.660
It was a bit more sadistic.

1:18:54.695 --> 1:18:58.872
I think that was a movie that
was a little more disturbing.

1:18:58.906 --> 1:19:03.842
It just didn't really have
much of a clear narrative

1:19:04.084 --> 1:19:06.707
that I like I mean for me
film is definitely an escape.

1:19:06.742 --> 1:19:09.123
I love fiction, so I think
that one was almost

1:19:09.158 --> 1:19:10.366
sort of borderline real

1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:12.092
and it just kind of
made me feel sick.

1:19:12.126 --> 1:19:13.783
- So yeah, The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre is one of

1:19:13.818 --> 1:19:16.510
my all-time favorite
video nasties.

1:19:16.544 --> 1:19:18.339
The strange thing
about that film was

1:19:18.374 --> 1:19:20.652
I remember watching that
and another bootleg version

1:19:20.686 --> 1:19:24.069
for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
and it was really fuzzy.

1:19:24.104 --> 1:19:26.071
Before I watched that
film, I felt scared

1:19:26.106 --> 1:19:28.177
because I knew something
really bad was gonna happen.

1:19:28.211 --> 1:19:30.213
Everyone was talking
about this film.

1:19:30.248 --> 1:19:32.802
But the crazy thing
is in the actual film,

1:19:32.837 --> 1:19:36.323
there's hardly any blood,
hardly any gore at all.

1:19:36.357 --> 1:19:37.634
In fact, there's basically none.

1:19:37.669 --> 1:19:39.982
Everything we see
happens off screen.

1:19:41.397 --> 1:19:43.502
All right, you see him grab Pam
and stick her up on the hook

1:19:43.537 --> 1:19:44.676
but you don't see anything else.

1:19:44.710 --> 1:19:48.369
You don't see any
incisions of hooks

1:19:48.404 --> 1:19:51.476
and bloody heads coming off
and guts or anything like that.

1:19:51.510 --> 1:19:53.754
A lot of that film
is what you don't see

1:19:53.789 --> 1:19:55.756
that is actually
scarier in that film.

1:19:55.791 --> 1:19:57.862
And for me The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre

1:19:57.896 --> 1:20:01.555
is one of the all-time best
not just video nasties,

1:20:01.589 --> 1:20:04.420
but one of the best
horror films of all time.

1:20:04.454 --> 1:20:06.042
So for me, you get
that kind of film

1:20:06.077 --> 1:20:09.321
and you think why would
you ban a piece of art?

1:20:09.356 --> 1:20:10.564
Because that's
what you're doing.

1:20:10.598 --> 1:20:12.048
You're banning pieces
of art with these films.

1:20:12.083 --> 1:20:13.878
- So the The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre,

1:20:13.912 --> 1:20:15.776
two siblings and three
of their friends,

1:20:15.811 --> 1:20:18.606
on route to visit their
grandfather's grave in Texas

1:20:18.641 --> 1:20:19.884
end up falling victim to

1:20:19.918 --> 1:20:22.852
a family of cannibalistic
psychopaths.

1:20:22.887 --> 1:20:24.405
[laughs]

1:20:24.440 --> 1:20:28.858
Yeah, when I saw Texas it was
by a company called Film Waves

1:20:28.893 --> 1:20:30.826
and I think the whole
thing about it was that

1:20:30.860 --> 1:20:32.897
it was based on a true story.

1:20:32.931 --> 1:20:34.933
That was the
biggest fear factor.

1:20:34.968 --> 1:20:37.108
It's interesting now
seeing film makers like

1:20:37.142 --> 1:20:38.626
Nicolas Rining Refin he thinks

1:20:38.661 --> 1:20:41.008
it's his favorite film as well.

1:20:41.043 --> 1:20:43.424
I was very lucky and
obviously McGunner

1:20:43.459 --> 1:20:46.048
and also received a copy of
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre

1:20:46.082 --> 1:20:49.016
signed by Tobe Hooper
himself for my 30th birthday.

1:20:49.051 --> 1:20:51.191
So the movie really
resonated with me.

1:20:51.225 --> 1:20:56.092
That was one of the films that
was almost slash doco style.

1:20:56.127 --> 1:20:58.888
It was very raw, very gritty

1:20:58.923 --> 1:21:00.890
and kind of changed
the face of cinema

1:21:00.925 --> 1:21:02.271
as far as horror goes.

1:21:02.305 --> 1:21:04.549
So definitely a big
thumbs up for me.

1:21:04.583 --> 1:21:06.378
It would be in my
top four for sure.

1:21:07.863 --> 1:21:10.589
- I think I've got this is
the German copy this one.

1:21:10.624 --> 1:21:13.696
So this is the German
copy of the video nasty.

1:21:13.730 --> 1:21:15.249
I actually really
like this cover art.

1:21:15.284 --> 1:21:17.251
You've got a chainsaw massacre

1:21:17.286 --> 1:21:19.702
going through this woman,
it's bloody brilliant.

1:21:21.704 --> 1:21:23.879
[screams]

1:21:30.057 --> 1:21:31.576
- Great film from
that list to me

1:21:31.610 --> 1:21:33.267
is The Texas Chainsaw Massacre

1:21:33.302 --> 1:21:36.098
and the hellish time
Tobe Hooper had trying

1:21:36.132 --> 1:21:38.963
to get that film made in one
of the hottest summers ever

1:21:38.997 --> 1:21:43.243
in the US with stinking,
rotting meat on set.

1:21:43.277 --> 1:21:46.177
I mean I'm sure the
experience of making that film

1:21:46.211 --> 1:21:48.558
was a video nasty in itself.

1:21:48.593 --> 1:21:51.527
Because a lot of them
are throwing up in
the heat of the day

1:21:51.561 --> 1:21:53.356
with the smell of the interiors

1:21:53.391 --> 1:21:56.221
and all the rotting flesh
that they had to keep filming.

1:21:56.256 --> 1:21:59.397
In those days they
weren't using digital.

1:21:59.431 --> 1:22:01.088
They were actually
shooting on 16 mil.

1:22:01.123 --> 1:22:03.194
So they knew that if
they wasted any film

1:22:03.228 --> 1:22:04.954
or wasted any time,

1:22:04.989 --> 1:22:09.338
then they may not get
to finish their film.

1:22:09.372 --> 1:22:12.237
The funders they
leaned on them strongly

1:22:12.272 --> 1:22:16.034
that they got the film
made in time and on budget

1:22:17.208 --> 1:22:19.210
and hopefully ended
up with something

1:22:19.244 --> 1:22:22.799
that they could sell or that
they could exploit in cinemas.

1:22:22.834 --> 1:22:25.147
And as we know it
became a massive hit.

1:22:25.181 --> 1:22:27.114
- [Announcer] After
you stop screaming,

1:22:27.149 --> 1:22:28.564
you'll start talking about it.

1:22:28.598 --> 1:22:31.774
[droning music]

1:22:31.808 --> 1:22:33.086
- I'm not sure it
was ever considered

1:22:33.120 --> 1:22:35.019
a video nasty in the USA,

1:22:35.053 --> 1:22:39.092
but of course when it came
out in Britain and Ireland,

1:22:39.126 --> 1:22:40.990
it quickly became
part of that list.

1:22:41.025 --> 1:22:44.580
Which is more amusing about
it, that film contains more

1:22:44.614 --> 1:22:47.376
psychological violence
than physical violence.

1:22:47.410 --> 1:22:49.274
Even though there is
physical violence in it,

1:22:49.309 --> 1:22:53.106
a lot of it off screen and
that is very interesting to me.

1:22:53.140 --> 1:22:55.418
It goes to show that
you don't need to show

1:22:55.453 --> 1:22:58.421
the really nasty stuff,
you just need to suggest it

1:22:58.456 --> 1:23:00.044
and then the audience
were deeply disturbed.

1:23:00.078 --> 1:23:02.218
Because there's nothing,
nothing, nothing more

1:23:02.253 --> 1:23:05.152
powerful than the human mind
and the human imagination.

1:23:05.187 --> 1:23:06.912
If you pull away
from what's happening

1:23:06.947 --> 1:23:08.949
and then leave it up
the audience member

1:23:08.984 --> 1:23:12.366
to decide what it is that
happened in that moment

1:23:12.401 --> 1:23:15.852
and how it came about, then
you find that they walk away

1:23:15.887 --> 1:23:18.924
with their own idea of the
worst possible scenario.

1:23:20.616 --> 1:23:23.929
That's an example I
think of cinema today,

1:23:23.964 --> 1:23:25.552
where you don't need
to show everything

1:23:25.586 --> 1:23:27.450
in order to have
that great effect.

1:23:27.485 --> 1:23:29.487
- Another fairly
obscure release of

1:23:29.521 --> 1:23:32.869
a not-so obscure movie would
be the Wizard Video release

1:23:32.904 --> 1:23:35.458
of the The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre.

1:23:36.839 --> 1:23:39.738
This was the first version
of the movie I got.

1:23:39.773 --> 1:23:41.154
This is the way
that I saw the film

1:23:41.188 --> 1:23:42.431
when it first came out.

1:23:42.465 --> 1:23:44.398
It's a very murky
dark grain print,

1:23:44.433 --> 1:23:45.641
but a lot of people would argue

1:23:45.675 --> 1:23:47.712
that's the only way
to see this movie.

1:23:47.746 --> 1:23:50.853
I know now that this tape
is worth quite a bit.

1:23:50.887 --> 1:23:52.475
It goes on eBay
for a lot of money.

1:23:52.510 --> 1:23:56.410
It's fully intact, you can
see all the flaps there.

1:23:56.445 --> 1:23:58.447
It's in really good
condition still,

1:23:58.481 --> 1:24:01.036
but it's definitely not
something I'm gonna let go of.

1:24:01.070 --> 1:24:02.140
I mean it's the
very first release

1:24:02.175 --> 1:24:03.590
of probably my all-time
favorite movie,

1:24:03.624 --> 1:24:05.902
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
so it's definitely one

1:24:05.937 --> 1:24:08.629
that I cherish and will
always have in my collection

1:24:08.664 --> 1:24:11.046
of awesome VHS movies.

1:24:12.116 --> 1:24:12.978
- Stop, stop.

1:24:14.049 --> 1:24:17.431
[chainsaw rattling]
[screaming]

1:24:17.466 --> 1:24:19.502
- Craziest memory
would have to be

1:24:19.537 --> 1:24:23.472
I think I was like grade
six, form one in school

1:24:23.506 --> 1:24:27.027
I was quite young and
I loved horror so much.

1:24:27.062 --> 1:24:29.409
At school they used to
call me the gore freak

1:24:29.443 --> 1:24:33.723
because I had a fascination
with the gore and the effects.

1:24:33.758 --> 1:24:38.349
It was probably not so much the
fear factor of these movies,

1:24:38.383 --> 1:24:40.661
but I was really interested
in how the makeup worked,

1:24:40.696 --> 1:24:44.872
so I was really trying to find
really gross makeup effects

1:24:44.907 --> 1:24:48.221
like in your Xtro and
a lot of these movies.

1:24:48.255 --> 1:24:49.981
Sort of push it
to the next limit,

1:24:50.015 --> 1:24:52.121
I had a mate of mine at school,

1:24:52.156 --> 1:24:53.674
we used to watch a lot
of these horror films

1:24:53.709 --> 1:24:54.951
and we'd got into
the video store.

1:24:54.986 --> 1:24:56.401
He knew because I
was the gore freak

1:24:56.436 --> 1:24:58.093
that I'd probably
pick a good film.

1:24:58.127 --> 1:25:00.888
So I introduced him
to the Evil Dead

1:25:00.923 --> 1:25:05.583
so I said to him if you really
want to test your stamina

1:25:05.617 --> 1:25:07.930
for this sort of stuff,
we're gonna drink milk.

1:25:07.964 --> 1:25:10.484
He said to me why am I
drinking milk during this film?

1:25:10.519 --> 1:25:12.452
I said just have a
glass of milk there.

1:25:12.486 --> 1:25:15.455
Then when the demon
started to spurt blood,

1:25:15.489 --> 1:25:18.837
which is white, I was
trying to make him vomit,

1:25:18.872 --> 1:25:21.392
so that was the
test drinking milk

1:25:21.426 --> 1:25:22.945
whilst watching Evil
Dead trying to make

1:25:22.979 --> 1:25:25.706
my friend vomit so it was
a tough one we used to go.

1:25:28.192 --> 1:25:31.022
[chainsaw buzzes]

1:25:34.991 --> 1:25:37.097
- Stop it, help!

1:25:37.132 --> 1:25:38.409
- Well it definitely
affected me.

1:25:38.443 --> 1:25:40.238
It's the core inspiration for my

1:25:40.273 --> 1:25:42.378
Cinema Therapy Video Nasties Mix

1:25:42.413 --> 1:25:44.794
Forbidden Horrors
and Dirty Sin Scores.

1:25:44.829 --> 1:25:48.073
It was me going down
this rabbit hole

1:25:48.108 --> 1:25:52.492
of finding these films
that made me realize

1:25:52.526 --> 1:25:55.736
the core connection
was all this gore.

1:25:55.771 --> 1:25:58.153
The music the tie-in
was the music.

1:25:58.187 --> 1:26:01.949
The 30 cents and the funky
disco and the prog rock.

1:26:01.984 --> 1:26:05.194
When I was looking for
a new project to compile

1:26:05.229 --> 1:26:09.819
for a VJ mix, it was perfect

1:26:09.854 --> 1:26:12.615
because I didn't really
know about the controversy

1:26:12.650 --> 1:26:16.999
until I started putting together
the pieces of these films

1:26:17.033 --> 1:26:18.345
and what they meant to be.

1:26:19.519 --> 1:26:21.210
Which was basically the music,

1:26:21.245 --> 1:26:24.317
it was the music that drove
me to find these films.

1:26:24.351 --> 1:26:25.904
- Now I Spit On Your
Grave definitely

1:26:25.939 --> 1:26:28.252
had a high impact on me.

1:26:28.286 --> 1:26:29.908
It was brutal.

1:26:29.943 --> 1:26:33.326
It was a feared movie
when it came out.

1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:35.845
Highly inspired
my movie Tomboys,

1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:38.227
my film Tomboys, which
is really five girls

1:26:38.262 --> 1:26:41.403
that kidnap a serial
rapist to seek revenge,

1:26:41.437 --> 1:26:44.716
again loosely based
on a true story.

1:26:44.751 --> 1:26:46.684
The funny thing I
found out afterwards

1:26:46.718 --> 1:26:48.858
was that the director
actually married

1:26:48.893 --> 1:26:51.102
the lead in that movie,
her name was Jennifer Hill,

1:26:51.136 --> 1:26:52.793
which was also my mother's name.

1:26:52.828 --> 1:26:57.833
So that was also kind of creepy
and I had an affinity to it.

1:26:59.006 --> 1:27:01.250
But definitely right up
there in my top four.

1:27:01.285 --> 1:27:02.838
- I think the video
nasties had affected

1:27:02.872 --> 1:27:06.876
a lot of my work down to
Gransportation, VHS Lives,

1:27:06.911 --> 1:27:09.810
Dance of Toxic Shlock,
The Crazy Corny Horror.

1:27:09.845 --> 1:27:12.813
It's really influenced
a lot of my work.

1:27:12.848 --> 1:27:15.851
- As far as censorship,
I don't really agree

1:27:15.885 --> 1:27:17.922
with censorship per say.

1:27:17.956 --> 1:27:21.408
I'm more of a believer in
having a good disclaimer

1:27:21.443 --> 1:27:24.031
which lists come of the
content that the viewer

1:27:24.066 --> 1:27:26.689
will be watching when
they put that film on.

1:27:28.208 --> 1:27:29.968
Some nights for
dinner you may be okay

1:27:30.003 --> 1:27:33.869
with necrophilia but
others you may not.

1:27:33.903 --> 1:27:38.218
So sometimes the subject
matter may not be what

1:27:38.253 --> 1:27:39.702
even the most
hardened horror fan

1:27:39.737 --> 1:27:42.912
is ready for at that
particular time.

1:27:42.947 --> 1:27:45.190
So just having a good disclaimer

1:27:45.225 --> 1:27:47.089
is really all that you need

1:27:47.123 --> 1:27:50.334
so that the viewer is
making the decision.

1:27:50.368 --> 1:27:52.232
It's in our hands how
far we want to watch,

1:27:52.267 --> 1:27:54.027
how far we want to take it

1:27:54.061 --> 1:27:55.925
and then there's no
creative expression

1:27:55.960 --> 1:27:58.721
that's taken away from the
artist behind the film.

1:27:58.756 --> 1:28:00.344
There's no watering
down of the message

1:28:00.378 --> 1:28:02.691
that they intended
to put out there,

1:28:02.725 --> 1:28:04.382
which was their
reasoning for behind

1:28:04.417 --> 1:28:06.350
making the film in
the first place.

1:28:06.384 --> 1:28:09.491
- Italy had a tradition
of extreme movies,

1:28:09.525 --> 1:28:14.047
especially in the 70s and 80s.

1:28:14.081 --> 1:28:17.464
Most of them are
big part of the list

1:28:17.499 --> 1:28:21.365
of the video nasties,
so titles like

1:28:21.399 --> 1:28:25.507
100 Bottoms, Cannibal
Holocaust, Cannibal Ferox

1:28:25.541 --> 1:28:30.546
or How Many Cemetery
just for some type of.

1:28:31.927 --> 1:28:35.379
Those are some of the
masterpiece that gets banned

1:28:35.413 --> 1:28:37.139
and forbidden for
many countries.

1:28:40.176 --> 1:28:45.181
Also surprise me to find amazing
titles like Driller Killer

1:28:46.597 --> 1:28:50.566
or Flesh For Frankenstein.

1:28:52.913 --> 1:28:56.158
I think censorship
is something really

1:28:56.192 --> 1:28:59.403
that doesn't have
reason to exist

1:28:59.437 --> 1:29:03.890
because yes it's good
to protect child,

1:29:03.924 --> 1:29:07.859
protect people that
is not ready or able

1:29:07.894 --> 1:29:12.036
to see and watch
this kind of movies,

1:29:12.070 --> 1:29:17.075
but people must have the freedom
to choose what they watch

1:29:17.938 --> 1:29:19.595
to enjoy what they want to enjoy

1:29:19.630 --> 1:29:22.218
and discovery what
needs to discovery.

1:29:22.253 --> 1:29:25.187
Especially thinking
that some titles now

1:29:25.221 --> 1:29:28.708
are considered masterpiece,

1:29:28.742 --> 1:29:31.814
we are able to watch
in TV and internet

1:29:31.849 --> 1:29:35.300
every kind of murder and
accident and disaster.

1:29:35.335 --> 1:29:39.477
But there is someone
that believe that a movie

1:29:39.512 --> 1:29:42.480
can be much more
dangerous than watching

1:29:42.515 --> 1:29:45.069
these kind of programs
and news and TV.

1:29:45.103 --> 1:29:47.174
- I mean the real
question is how do you

1:29:47.209 --> 1:29:48.175
actually legislate morality?

1:29:48.210 --> 1:29:49.694
Where is there a
line in the sand

1:29:49.729 --> 1:29:52.525
that you can draw for a
massive group of people

1:29:52.559 --> 1:29:55.148
that applies to
every single's person

1:29:55.182 --> 1:29:58.185
own personal line
where they decide

1:29:58.220 --> 1:30:00.118
something is decent and
something is not decent.

1:30:00.153 --> 1:30:02.845
You can't do it, it's
a subjective thing.

1:30:02.880 --> 1:30:06.642
So to unnaturally
enforce this line

1:30:06.677 --> 1:30:08.437
where you say this
is appropriate

1:30:08.472 --> 1:30:10.439
you can watch The Crying Game,

1:30:10.474 --> 1:30:14.201
but you can't watch The Hills
Have Eyes, right I don't know.

1:30:14.236 --> 1:30:18.205
It's a fallacy you can't do it

1:30:18.240 --> 1:30:20.069
because everyone has
their own tastes.

1:30:20.104 --> 1:30:21.899
Everyone has to
decide on their own

1:30:21.933 --> 1:30:24.453
what is appropriate,
what is over the line.

1:30:24.488 --> 1:30:26.455
That's our right as people.

1:30:26.490 --> 1:30:27.456
That's our right as consumers.

1:30:27.491 --> 1:30:29.941
That's our right as patrons

1:30:29.976 --> 1:30:32.703
of whatever art form
we want to patronize.

1:30:33.842 --> 1:30:38.329
To arbitrarily
put this line here

1:30:38.363 --> 1:30:40.538
where you're saying everything
on this side of this

1:30:40.573 --> 1:30:45.025
is forbidden from
you, it doesn't work.

1:30:46.613 --> 1:30:48.684
[screaming]

1:30:48.719 --> 1:30:51.376
[droning music]

1:30:52.792 --> 1:30:55.104
[screaming]

1:30:56.554 --> 1:30:58.176
- Just wanted to talk.

1:30:59.419 --> 1:31:00.834
- [Lloyd] Nothing
should be censored

1:31:00.869 --> 1:31:03.319
other than for children and
that's up to the parents

1:31:03.354 --> 1:31:04.838
to keep the children away.

1:31:04.873 --> 1:31:05.701
- Censorship.

1:31:06.944 --> 1:31:10.948
- The time of the video
nasties is a weird time.

1:31:10.982 --> 1:31:14.572
It's almost like if you
had like what we thought

1:31:14.607 --> 1:31:16.471
was a really cool
cover to your movie

1:31:16.505 --> 1:31:19.819
would instantly get
put on this list.

1:31:19.853 --> 1:31:24.858
So basically you had
movies that were basically

1:31:25.997 --> 1:31:29.725
art house films
like Driller Killer,

1:31:31.209 --> 1:31:34.523
which see that cover,
that cover is awesome.

1:31:34.558 --> 1:31:36.387
We think that's awesome.

1:31:36.421 --> 1:31:40.149
But there's little of
that actually in the film.

1:31:40.184 --> 1:31:41.357
What you get is
a character piece

1:31:41.392 --> 1:31:43.843
of a man slowly going insane

1:31:43.877 --> 1:31:48.882
for various reasons and
all justifiable reasons.

1:31:50.401 --> 1:31:54.785
They way he vents is kind
of a little questionable.

1:31:54.819 --> 1:31:59.721
Like he buys a drill
with its own power pack

1:32:00.584 --> 1:32:01.999
and just goes in the streets

1:32:02.033 --> 1:32:05.209
and starts taking out
homeless people with it.

1:32:05.243 --> 1:32:07.349
But that's well into the movie.

1:32:08.488 --> 1:32:10.421
Before that, you
see fantastic scenes

1:32:10.455 --> 1:32:14.287
like when he and his
lesbian roommates

1:32:14.321 --> 1:32:17.911
they order pizza, a large pizza,

1:32:17.946 --> 1:32:20.535
you get to see him
played by director

1:32:20.569 --> 1:32:23.745
Abel Ferrara consume
this entire pizza,

1:32:23.779 --> 1:32:26.817
this entire large
pizza by himself.

1:32:28.612 --> 1:32:30.752
And you see many
art house moments

1:32:30.786 --> 1:32:32.236
like that in Driller Killer,

1:32:32.270 --> 1:32:35.066
which was clearly
labeled a video nasty

1:32:35.101 --> 1:32:37.068
just for the cover alone.

1:32:37.103 --> 1:32:40.347
- I think censorship will be
moving in a good direction

1:32:40.382 --> 1:32:43.558
in the future, which
means it will be more lax.

1:32:43.592 --> 1:32:45.490
There's going to be more avenues

1:32:45.525 --> 1:32:50.150
just every day for the artist
to get their art out there

1:32:50.185 --> 1:32:53.533
to the fans directly
going hand in hand

1:32:53.568 --> 1:32:55.708
and having that
connection and cutting out

1:32:55.742 --> 1:32:58.642
the bigger companies and
some of the other sources

1:32:58.676 --> 1:33:03.163
that get in the middle and
meddle in our entertainment

1:33:03.198 --> 1:33:04.751
where they don't belong.

1:33:04.786 --> 1:33:08.824
I think also the calling
for having the ability

1:33:08.859 --> 1:33:12.207
to watch a video nasty,
take your aggression out

1:33:12.241 --> 1:33:15.866
on entertainment,
throw up, cry, scream,

1:33:15.900 --> 1:33:17.799
but it's all at your screen.

1:33:17.833 --> 1:33:20.284
We have the message,
we know it's happening

1:33:20.318 --> 1:33:22.217
in our neighborhoods
or our towns.

1:33:22.251 --> 1:33:25.427
But the ability to
press pause and stop

1:33:25.461 --> 1:33:27.878
and just come back
to it, revisit,

1:33:27.912 --> 1:33:32.468
you can still handle it as an
entertainment level type thing

1:33:32.503 --> 1:33:35.713
instead of just
watching the news

1:33:35.748 --> 1:33:37.542
and having that
reality in your face.

1:33:37.577 --> 1:33:40.822
It's having more
control as a viewer.

1:33:40.856 --> 1:33:43.583
It's having more control as
a human being in general.

1:33:44.791 --> 1:33:46.517
There's gonna be
more calling for it

1:33:46.551 --> 1:33:49.037
as we move forward
and the mindset

1:33:49.071 --> 1:33:51.660
that people are in these days.

1:33:51.695 --> 1:33:56.147
We need those outlets and
as long as we need them,

1:33:56.182 --> 1:33:57.355
they're gonna get stronger

1:33:57.390 --> 1:33:58.943
and they're gonna
flow in the direction

1:33:58.978 --> 1:34:01.739
of the voice of the people.

1:34:01.774 --> 1:34:03.499
- I was watching those movies

1:34:03.534 --> 1:34:05.674
before I even knew what
video nasties even were,

1:34:05.709 --> 1:34:08.297
like Friday the 13th, The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre,

1:34:08.332 --> 1:34:10.541
all those types of movies
that were banned on that list.

1:34:10.575 --> 1:34:13.233
They were banned over there,
censored so you couldn't
even get them over there.

1:34:13.268 --> 1:34:14.752
We had a luckily we
over here at the States,

1:34:14.787 --> 1:34:17.306
we watched them over
here and over there

1:34:17.341 --> 1:34:19.999
you'd have to get them on
bootleg and that kind of thing.

1:34:20.033 --> 1:34:21.690
I'm not really sure I
think it was over there,

1:34:21.725 --> 1:34:23.209
possibly try to order them

1:34:23.243 --> 1:34:26.522
through a merchandise
video catalog probably.

1:34:26.557 --> 1:34:30.009
Video nasties man, there's
some probably good ones

1:34:30.043 --> 1:34:33.184
like Cannibal Holocaust, I
remember watching it way later

1:34:33.219 --> 1:34:35.877
I was like 13 watching that.

1:34:35.911 --> 1:34:37.982
I didn't even know it was
a video nasty at the time.

1:34:38.017 --> 1:34:40.571
I found out through
research on Fangoria

1:34:40.605 --> 1:34:41.676
what video nasties were.

1:34:41.710 --> 1:34:43.367
I would see the
term video nasties,

1:34:43.401 --> 1:34:45.265
but I didn't really know
what that term really was.

1:34:45.300 --> 1:34:46.681
I did some research on them.

1:34:46.715 --> 1:34:48.096
It was like this
list of these movies

1:34:48.130 --> 1:34:50.063
that were banned, but
a pretty cool list.

1:34:50.098 --> 1:34:51.858
Because it had movies on
there that I would use

1:34:51.893 --> 1:34:55.068
for research to find at
video stores over here also,

1:34:55.103 --> 1:34:57.726
like Don't Drip Blood
and things like that

1:34:57.761 --> 1:34:59.003
that were on that list.

1:34:59.038 --> 1:35:01.488
Evil Speak and
that kind of stuff,

1:35:01.523 --> 1:35:03.905
I would use that as
a list as a guideline

1:35:03.939 --> 1:35:06.321
so I could find these
movies at video shops.

1:35:06.355 --> 1:35:08.012
But the ones I remember
the most getting

1:35:08.047 --> 1:35:12.914
was Cannibal
Holocaust, crazy movie,

1:35:12.948 --> 1:35:15.710
Xtro which is really
weird, especially the part

1:35:15.744 --> 1:35:17.194
where the dude's getting born.

1:35:17.228 --> 1:35:21.232
He's kind of coming out
of this weird alien birth.

1:35:21.267 --> 1:35:23.269
It's really strange, it's
all slimy coming out of there

1:35:23.303 --> 1:35:25.823
it's like ew, but
it's really cool.
