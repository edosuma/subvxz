00:07.667 --> 00:10.458
Uh-oh. Charlie's in a time-out.
What'd she do?

00:10.542 --> 00:12.500
She tried to give your baby brother
to the mailman.

00:12.583 --> 00:13.667
Mm-hmm.

00:14.250 --> 00:16.125
Even put a stamp on his forehead.

00:18.834 --> 00:21.041
Wait a minute, didn't PJ try to mail me?

00:21.125 --> 00:23.000
Yes, and you tried to mail Gabe,

00:23.083 --> 00:24.333
and Gabe tried to mail Charlie.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.375
See, these are the sweet family memories
you just don't get with e-mail.

00:29.458 --> 00:30.458
Mm.

00:31.041 --> 00:32.125
Okay.

00:34.792 --> 00:36.417
Charlie, have you learned your lesson?

00:36.500 --> 00:37.375
No.

00:38.875 --> 00:39.875
Close enough.

00:39.959 --> 00:41.041
Get outta here.

00:41.125 --> 00:42.000
Go, go, go.

00:43.125 --> 00:45.083
Uh... Oh, um...

00:46.000 --> 00:48.917
By the way, uh,
I was on your school website this morning,

00:49.041 --> 00:52.125
and I noticed that your volleyball team
needs a team mom.

00:52.208 --> 00:54.542
Don't tell me
you're thinking about calling.

00:54.625 --> 00:55.750
Called.

00:56.709 --> 00:59.041
But you're, you're not doing it, right?

00:59.125 --> 01:00.583
Doing it.

01:00.667 --> 01:01.500
Mom!

01:01.583 --> 01:03.875
Don't you think we should have
had a conversation about this?

01:03.959 --> 01:05.291
Just did.

01:11.125 --> 01:12.542
What are you smiling about?

01:13.333 --> 01:14.792
It'll be your turn next.

Hey, Teddy.

02:13.583 --> 02:15.083
What's with the lab coat?

02:15.166 --> 02:16.792
Oh, I got a new job at the mall.

02:16.875 --> 02:19.375
I’m a fragrance technician at Bimbel's.

02:19.458 --> 02:21.041
- Fragrance technician.
- Mm-hmm.

02:21.125 --> 02:22.792
Basically, I hold up a bottle of cologne,

02:22.875 --> 02:24.583
and do this...

02:25.000 --> 02:27.375
Very different from when I used to work
at Kwikki-Chikki,

02:27.458 --> 02:29.417
where I did this...

02:29.500 --> 02:31.583
And this...

02:31.667 --> 02:33.667
And sometimes this...

02:35.083 --> 02:36.333
Huh.

02:36.417 --> 02:38.041
Now, you try this.

02:45.834 --> 02:47.041
This is baseball.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.375
Not my favorite sport,

02:49.458 --> 02:54.500
But when I get to watch it,
I get three hours all to myself.

03:01.083 --> 03:02.458
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

03:02.625 --> 03:04.041
There's something we need to talk about.

03:04.125 --> 03:05.667
Oh, no.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.375
Do I have to call my lawyer?

03:08.917 --> 03:09.875
My insurance guy?

03:09.959 --> 03:11.375
Please don't say both.

03:12.917 --> 03:15.291
Don't worry.
You don't have to call anybody.

03:15.375 --> 03:17.625
Besides, troublemaking was more

03:17.709 --> 03:19.083
Tween Gabe's thing.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.417
I’m Teen Gabe now.

03:22.083 --> 03:23.333
Well, welcome, sir.

03:23.417 --> 03:25.709
We've, uh, been nervously expecting you.

03:27.083 --> 03:29.000
All right. So, here's the thing.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.583
Tomorrow, I need your help.

03:32.375 --> 03:33.375
Because...

03:34.417 --> 03:35.750
I have a date.

03:35.834 --> 03:37.250
Nice.

03:37.375 --> 03:39.583
- So, who's the girl?
- Her name's Emma.

03:39.667 --> 03:40.625
She's new at our school.

03:40.709 --> 03:43.750
Okay, so because she doesn't know you,
she agreed to go out with you.

03:46.041 --> 03:47.542
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.083
Okay. So, here's the plan.

03:51.208 --> 03:53.875
You pick us up,
you take us to the theater,

03:53.959 --> 03:55.834
and you sit as far away from us
as possible.

03:58.125 --> 03:59.458
Questions?

03:59.542 --> 04:01.208
Can I speak to her?

04:02.125 --> 04:03.125
Uh, yes.

04:03.208 --> 04:05.875
I have taken the liberty
of preparing some small talk for you.

04:11.291 --> 04:13.917
"Hello. I’m Bob."

04:15.250 --> 04:16.125
"Good-bye."

04:18.667 --> 04:21.041
You know,
now that I’m hearing it out loud,

04:21.125 --> 04:22.959
we may not need "I’m Bob".

04:32.625 --> 04:33.458
Hey, Emmett.

04:33.542 --> 04:35.250
How's the road trip to Death Valley?

04:36.333 --> 04:38.166
Oh, you ran out of gas?

04:38.250 --> 04:39.834
That can't be good.

04:41.375 --> 04:42.917
Vultures?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.208
That can't be good.

04:48.125 --> 04:49.166
Emmett.

04:49.583 --> 04:51.625
Dude, Emmett.
You're not gonna believe this.

04:51.709 --> 04:53.208
I think the clown moved out

04:53.291 --> 04:55.291
'cause there's a really cute girl
in that apartment.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.500
Well, you can't call dibs!

04:59.709 --> 05:01.208
We're not even sure if you're coming back.

05:02.625 --> 05:04.166
Sorry, dude. I’m making my move.

05:10.834 --> 05:12.500
Yeah.

05:13.917 --> 05:16.458
Up, and down.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.959
Up, and down.

05:21.333 --> 05:22.333
Up...

05:23.792 --> 05:25.000
And down.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.041
I hear this movie Is pretty good.

05:35.125 --> 05:36.959
Yeah, me too.

05:37.041 --> 05:38.291
"Yeah, me too?"

05:38.375 --> 05:39.542
That's all you got?

05:41.500 --> 05:43.583
I should have written out
some cards for myself.

05:55.041 --> 05:56.625
Oh. Great, thanks.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.166
My daughter's on a date with a kid,

06:01.250 --> 06:02.667
and I’m keeping an eye on them.

06:04.917 --> 06:06.041
You know what?

06:06.125 --> 06:08.208
I think that's my kid
she's on the date with.

06:08.291 --> 06:10.250
Bob Duncan.

06:10.333 --> 06:11.750
Hey, Randy Schleebee. How you doing?

06:11.834 --> 06:13.291
I’m good.

06:16.375 --> 06:17.625
Have some popcorn.

06:17.709 --> 06:19.250
Hmm? Thanks.

06:23.709 --> 06:25.125
Have all the popcorn.

06:25.875 --> 06:27.667
Whoa. Salty.

06:30.792 --> 06:32.417
Yuck. Root beer.

06:34.834 --> 06:35.834
My bad.

06:37.333 --> 06:38.542
Oh, it's starting.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.125
Man.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.208
I can't believe we lost again.

06:50.291 --> 06:51.750
What do you think the problem is?

06:51.834 --> 06:53.750
The other team scored more points than us.

06:55.875 --> 06:58.083
- Um, I have an idea.
- Mm!

06:58.375 --> 06:59.291
Nope.

06:59.375 --> 07:00.875
Mom, remember we made an agreement.

07:00.959 --> 07:05.083
As team mom, you can only answer questions
about snacks and schedules.

07:06.083 --> 07:07.542
We even put this in writing.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.875
Well, if she gives advice
as awesomely as she slices oranges,

07:11.959 --> 07:13.000
maybe she's got something.

07:13.083 --> 07:14.417
I like this girl.

07:15.542 --> 07:16.625
Okay, ladies. Listen up.

07:16.709 --> 07:17.750
I’ve got a story for you.

07:17.834 --> 07:20.667
Oh, just so long as it's not
one of your college stories.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.458
- When I was in college...
- Here we go.

07:23.709 --> 07:27.291
I'm played hockey for the Southwest Denver
Community College Lady Icers.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.166
We'd lost 10 games in a row.

07:29.542 --> 07:31.333
But all that was about to change

07:31.417 --> 07:33.041
the night that we played our archrival

07:33.125 --> 07:36.000
the Northeast Pueblo
Community College Lady Checkers.

07:38.417 --> 07:41.333
This is time you're never gonna get back.

07:42.667 --> 07:44.583
Now, because of a terrible blizzard,

07:44.667 --> 07:46.250
we had to stay In a motel.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.041
Best thing that ever happened to us.

07:48.125 --> 07:51.000
We all got to know each other
and we really bonded.

07:51.083 --> 07:52.917
And you know what happened
at the next game?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
No, but I’m on the edge of my seat.

07:56.959 --> 07:59.166
One of their players
tripped me from behind

07:59.792 --> 08:01.834
and our entire team jumped that girl

08:01.917 --> 08:03.458
and cross-checked
the daylights out of her.

08:03.542 --> 08:04.625
Ba-bam!

08:07.333 --> 08:08.709
It was so touching.

08:09.834 --> 08:12.041
To recap, your advice is that

08:12.125 --> 08:13.875
we attack someone?

08:13.959 --> 08:15.917
Well, not at first.

08:16.000 --> 08:16.917
Amy: No, no, no.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.792
I’m saying that you invite
the team over for a slumber party.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.500
So you guys can all bond.

08:21.583 --> 08:22.667
I love parties.

08:22.750 --> 08:24.750
And I just got a new sleeping bag!

08:26.250 --> 08:27.917
Okay, you are way too perky.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.792
Looks like we're having a sleepover.

08:30.875 --> 08:33.458
Yes, in my new sleeping bag!

08:34.959 --> 08:36.250
Seriously, just dial it down.

08:42.125 --> 08:44.291
What a day.

08:44.375 --> 08:45.542
What a day.

08:47.709 --> 08:49.000
She sat so close.

08:49.083 --> 08:50.875
He sat so close.

08:52.417 --> 08:53.792
Our hands touched.

08:53.875 --> 08:55.583
Our hands touched!

08:57.500 --> 08:59.000
Wait, what are you talking about?

08:59.083 --> 09:00.375
Emma's dad.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.000
What a total nightmare.
I never wanna see him again.

09:06.333 --> 09:07.667
Dad, who says you have to?

09:07.750 --> 09:09.208
Just because I’m hanging out with Emma

09:09.250 --> 09:11.500
doesn't mean that
you have to do stuff with her dad.

09:11.583 --> 09:12.500
Really?

09:12.583 --> 09:14.500
I don't think Randy feels the same way.

09:15.709 --> 09:16.667
What do you mean?

09:16.750 --> 09:18.667
Because he wrote his phone number
on my hand.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.625
Home.

09:22.709 --> 09:24.125
And cell.

09:36.375 --> 09:37.500
Hey.

09:43.834 --> 09:44.875
I’m Molly.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.250
I’m PJ.

09:46.333 --> 09:47.583
Welcome to the neighborhood.

09:48.208 --> 09:50.125
I didn't know
I was living across from a doctor.

09:50.208 --> 09:51.417
Oh, you are?

09:53.417 --> 09:55.083
I was talking about you.

09:55.166 --> 09:56.250
I saw your coat.

09:56.333 --> 09:57.917
Oh.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.667
- Oh, you think--
- It's so impressive

09:59.750 --> 10:01.625
that someone so young could be a doctor.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.458
I’ve worked really hard.

10:07.375 --> 10:08.709
So what's your specialty?

10:08.792 --> 10:11.500
My specialty? I-- uh...

10:12.417 --> 10:13.959
Make people smell better.

10:15.917 --> 10:18.625
Oh, so you're
an ear, nose, and throat guy?

10:19.542 --> 10:21.000
Mostly nose.

10:21.083 --> 10:25.709
I'd say it's 50% nose,
30% ear, 30% throat.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.583
That's 110%.

10:29.125 --> 10:31.250
That's just how much I give.

10:34.083 --> 10:35.500
So what do you do, Molly?

10:35.625 --> 10:37.834
Oh, uh, I’m a college student.

10:38.625 --> 10:40.083
Well, it was nice meeting you, PJ.

10:40.166 --> 10:41.834
You know, actually-- Um.

10:43.166 --> 10:46.500
I, uh, I’m cooking dinner tonight

10:47.083 --> 10:48.208
if you wanna come over.

10:48.792 --> 10:50.375
The diagnosis is meatloaf.

10:56.083 --> 10:57.125
Hey, girls.

10:57.208 --> 10:58.792
How's the bonding going?

11:01.917 --> 11:02.959
Okay.

11:03.875 --> 11:05.375
I see what the problem is.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.041
Put your phones in the basket.

11:08.125 --> 11:09.875
Good. Dump it.

11:09.959 --> 11:11.250
- In.
- Aw, man.

11:11.875 --> 11:12.709
Teddy.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.875
Vonnie, you too.

11:17.333 --> 11:18.750
What if my boyfriend calls?

11:18.834 --> 11:19.917
You have a boyfriend now?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.250
Here.

11:21.333 --> 11:22.333
Okay, girls.

11:22.417 --> 11:23.542
Forget about your phones.

11:28.417 --> 11:29.667
Okay, everybody.

11:29.750 --> 11:31.166
We're gonna do a bonding exercise.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.583
Now get up. Get over there. Form a circle.

11:33.667 --> 11:36.250
Let's go. Hustle, hustle. Get a move on.

11:36.333 --> 11:37.417
Okay.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.500
Reach in the circle and grab two hands.

11:40.250 --> 11:44.583
Now the goal here is to untie the knot
without letting go.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.458
It's very difficult,
but if you work together,

11:46.542 --> 11:47.834
You'll see how easy it is.

11:47.917 --> 11:48.875
Go.

11:50.375 --> 11:52.208
- Ow. Ow.
- Turn this way.

11:52.291 --> 11:54.083
- No, the other way!
- Ow.

11:54.166 --> 11:55.583
Ow, watch it!

11:55.709 --> 11:57.709
Get your butt out of my face!

11:58.875 --> 12:01.083
Get your face out of my butt.

12:04.959 --> 12:08.041
You girls have got to learn
to work together.

12:09.709 --> 12:12.041
Okay, I need a volunteer. Teddy.

12:12.125 --> 12:14.375
Everyone form a circle around Teddy.

12:14.458 --> 12:15.458
Amy: Come on.

12:17.667 --> 12:21.000
Now, you're going to close your eyes

12:21.083 --> 12:23.208
and make your body stiff and straight.

12:23.291 --> 12:25.458
And then you're going
to lean into the circle,

12:25.542 --> 12:27.041
now, you're gonna feel like
you're falling,

12:27.125 --> 12:28.417
but you're not.

12:28.500 --> 12:31.667
Because your teammates
are going to keep you upright.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.375
There we go.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.375
Now we're working together.

12:40.959 --> 12:42.750
Good. How you doing, Teddy?

12:43.667 --> 12:44.792
You know, actually pretty good.

12:44.875 --> 12:46.250
Good.

12:48.583 --> 12:49.750
Teddy: Aah!

12:53.625 --> 12:55.875
I have to have a phone, I’m a mom.

13:09.125 --> 13:10.500
Hi, Gabe.

13:10.583 --> 13:11.792
Emma.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.375
I was just wondering
if you wanted to go out for ice cream.

13:14.500 --> 13:15.333
Sure.

13:15.375 --> 13:16.500
Why not make it a foursome?

13:16.583 --> 13:17.458
Hey.

13:18.959 --> 13:20.792
Hey, you know where I live now.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.208
Come on, Bob-o.

13:23.250 --> 13:25.125
We had so much fun this afternoon,

13:25.208 --> 13:26.917
it'd be a crime
not to keep the party going.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.625
Yeah. Oh, whoa.

13:30.333 --> 13:31.792
Come on, Gabe. A little help?

13:31.875 --> 13:33.291
You smell like flowers.

13:34.625 --> 13:35.959
Oh, you, you know what?

13:36.041 --> 13:38.166
What am I thinking? I can't go anywhere.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.834
I got two little ones
I gotta take care of.

13:40.333 --> 13:41.834
I hear you, Bobsled.

13:42.875 --> 13:44.417
That's a cry for help.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.041
So I’m staying right here with you.

13:47.291 --> 13:49.375
Maybe we can just have ice cream here.

13:49.458 --> 13:52.208
Looks like
the party's staying home, Bobcat.

13:55.375 --> 13:58.250
As you can tell, I’ve been thinking
of some nicknames for you.

13:58.333 --> 14:00.375
So you think of some names for me.

14:01.166 --> 14:02.333
Oh, I am.

14:07.667 --> 14:10.417
Okay, we are going to do
another bonding exercise.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.000
Everyone find a partner.

14:12.875 --> 14:13.959
Amy: Okay, good.

14:14.041 --> 14:16.166
Now I want each of you
to tell your partner

14:16.250 --> 14:17.834
one thing you like about her

14:17.917 --> 14:19.250
and one thing you don't.

14:21.041 --> 14:23.291
By the end of this,
we're all gonna be very close.

14:26.709 --> 14:29.458
Oh, yeah? Yeah, my head's too big?

14:31.041 --> 14:33.000
Well, your head is too small!

14:34.709 --> 14:36.875
I am not overdramatic!

14:37.959 --> 14:40.375
She said overdramatically.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.875
Oh, wait a sec.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.667
My bad.

14:45.750 --> 14:47.417
This is actually really funny.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.083
Um, this is not a bonding exercise.

14:51.125 --> 14:55.125
No. We did this in my acting class
to break down our emotions.

14:56.875 --> 15:00.208
I feel so worthless!

15:01.458 --> 15:03.375
Well, as you can see, it's very effective.

15:04.333 --> 15:05.291
You know what, Vonnie?

15:05.375 --> 15:07.583
You're even meaner than coach Hammerstone!

15:07.667 --> 15:10.417
Oh, please.
Nobody's meaner than that diphthong.

15:10.875 --> 15:12.500
- Yeah, the worst.
- I hate him.

15:12.583 --> 15:13.709
We don't like the coach?

15:13.792 --> 15:14.792
Hate him.

15:14.875 --> 15:16.417
And I like everybody.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.375
Well, well, that's it.

15:19.500 --> 15:22.250
The best thing any team can bond over,

15:22.333 --> 15:23.917
a common enemy.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.250
Grab your coats.

15:26.208 --> 15:28.500
Wait. What about the slumber party?

15:28.583 --> 15:29.750
Oh, don't worry.

15:29.834 --> 15:31.542
After we humiliate the coach,

15:31.625 --> 15:33.667
we'll all come back here
and get in our jammies.

15:42.500 --> 15:46.125
If there's one thing I’ve learned
from all my years of doctoring,

15:47.166 --> 15:49.166
it's that sticks and stones...

15:49.875 --> 15:51.208
can break your bones.

15:53.458 --> 15:54.792
- Good to know.
- Mm-hmm.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.458
You know who used to live
in your apartment, Molly?

15:58.542 --> 15:59.834
A clown.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.375
Oh, right. Patches.

16:01.500 --> 16:02.625
I’m subletting from him.

16:02.709 --> 16:03.875
He's working on a cruise ship.

16:05.625 --> 16:06.917
Boats and clowns.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Two of my biggest fears.

16:09.083 --> 16:11.709
Actually my biggest fear would be

16:11.792 --> 16:14.792
a boat full of spiders, driven by a clown.

16:16.959 --> 16:17.959
Okay.

16:18.625 --> 16:21.583
So, shall we retire to the...

16:23.458 --> 16:24.750
Over there?

16:25.917 --> 16:28.375
Hey, can I ask you something?

16:28.875 --> 16:29.792
Sure.

16:29.875 --> 16:32.041
I fell off my bike and scraped my elbow.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.875
I think it might be infected.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.709
- Would you take a look?
- Oh, um.

16:37.208 --> 16:38.792
I’m ear, nose, and throat.

16:38.875 --> 16:41.875
You need more of a wrist,
elbow, armpit guy.

16:43.208 --> 16:44.041
Still.

16:44.125 --> 16:45.458
You are a doctor, right?

16:46.208 --> 16:48.166
Ah. Got me there.

16:49.625 --> 16:51.500
Okay. Let's take a look.

16:52.667 --> 16:54.542
Ew, ew, ew.

16:54.625 --> 16:56.500
Ew. That's disgusting.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.625
- Is it infected?
- It's something.

16:58.709 --> 17:00.959
Cover it up!

17:01.041 --> 17:02.000
Oh,

17:02.083 --> 17:05.417
I would rather be
on the spider-clown boat right now.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.083
PJ...

17:10.166 --> 17:12.208
You're not really a doctor, are you?

17:13.417 --> 17:15.667
No.

17:16.417 --> 17:17.291
I’m not. I...

17:17.375 --> 17:20.458
I spray cologne
at Bimbel's Department Store.

17:20.542 --> 17:21.917
Why did you lie?

17:22.000 --> 17:25.125
Because you seemed so impressed
by all the doctor stuff.

17:26.083 --> 17:28.250
I didn't think you'd like me
if you knew what I really do.

17:29.333 --> 17:30.458
I’m sorry.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.458
Well... Actually.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.792
I wasn't completely honest
with you either.

17:38.709 --> 17:40.083
What do you mean?

17:40.166 --> 17:42.000
I’m not really a student.

17:43.041 --> 17:44.542
What are you?

17:44.625 --> 17:45.875
This is a surprise.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.083
I don't usually tell people
on the first date,

17:53.166 --> 17:54.750
but it kind of came up naturally.

17:54.834 --> 17:56.291
Okay, okay, okay. Um...

17:57.083 --> 18:00.291
I just need some time to get used to this.

18:01.125 --> 18:03.417
PJ, a lot of people are afraid of clowns,

18:03.458 --> 18:05.041
but I can help you get over that.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.917
Okay, okay, okay. Um...

18:08.500 --> 18:09.834
We'll start tomorrow.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.083
Take that, Hammerstone!

18:23.667 --> 18:24.834
- Whoa.
- Yes.

18:25.834 --> 18:28.208
Vonnie: Yeah, taste my two-ply fury!

18:28.291 --> 18:29.500
Great shot, Vonnie.

18:29.583 --> 18:31.291
- You rock!
- Yeah!

18:31.375 --> 18:32.625
Keep firing, girls.

18:32.709 --> 18:34.917
Five bucks if anyone can get it
down the chimney.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Ho!

18:37.083 --> 18:38.041
Look at this.

18:38.125 --> 18:39.500
We're really coming together as a team.

18:40.083 --> 18:41.750
Your idea actually worked.

18:41.834 --> 18:43.250
Well, of course it worked.

18:43.333 --> 18:44.542
Why are you surprised?

18:44.625 --> 18:47.542
I don't know, maybe I’ve been influenced
by the last 50 ideas

18:47.625 --> 18:49.083
that went so horribly wrong.

18:50.083 --> 18:52.834
Well, maybe in the future
you'll give your old mom some credit.

18:52.917 --> 18:54.333
She knows what she's doing.

18:55.250 --> 18:56.709
Mrs. Duncan?

18:56.792 --> 18:59.542
Why does coach Hammerstone's welcome mat
say "The Johnsons"?

19:00.875 --> 19:02.000
Huh?

19:03.083 --> 19:05.959
This is 306 North Birchwood, right?

19:06.041 --> 19:08.542
This is 306 South Birchwood.

19:08.625 --> 19:09.667
Bummer.

19:13.792 --> 19:15.041
Run!

19:20.667 --> 19:24.667
Whoever doesn't get arrested,
meet me at 306 North birchwood!

19:30.625 --> 19:32.375
Wait, wait, wait. Don't answer that.

19:32.375 --> 19:35.000
Gabe, it's Emma. Are you home?

19:35.083 --> 19:36.333
It's a trick.

19:36.417 --> 19:37.709
I know he's out there.

19:38.667 --> 19:39.709
I’m not here.

19:43.417 --> 19:44.333
Emma.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.917
And the Rand-man.

19:46.875 --> 19:48.834
I didn't wanna say anything
so I could trick your dad.

19:50.291 --> 19:52.333
So, where is the Kabobster?

19:53.125 --> 19:54.250
Um...

19:54.875 --> 19:55.959
He's not home.

19:56.041 --> 19:57.166
Yes, he is.

19:58.291 --> 19:59.875
Uh, no. No he's not.

19:59.959 --> 20:03.583
She falls apart every time he leaves
so we try to keep her out of the loop.

20:05.250 --> 20:06.333
He's in there.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.000
Oh, I love this guy.

20:11.083 --> 20:12.375
Always playing games.

20:13.792 --> 20:15.333
- Gotcha!
- Bob: Hey.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.709
- So, want to sit down?
- Sure.

20:21.375 --> 20:23.625
Isn't it great
that our dads are best friends?

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Yeah, about that.

20:27.583 --> 20:28.458
Um...

20:29.417 --> 20:30.583
The truth is...

20:31.542 --> 20:34.250
my dad isn't crazy about your dad.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.917
What? What's wrong With my dad?

20:38.083 --> 20:40.041
For one thing, he's kind of loud.

20:40.125 --> 20:42.125
He's outgoing.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.583
He makes up a bunch of stupid nicknames.

20:44.667 --> 20:46.875
Kabobster? That's hilarious.

20:48.375 --> 20:52.166
I mean, he licks his fingers
and eats other people's food.

20:52.792 --> 20:54.000
Yeah.

20:54.083 --> 20:55.709
I’ve got nothing for that one.

20:56.208 --> 20:59.000
You know, your dad's not exactly perfect.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.000
He's grumpy, and messy,

21:01.083 --> 21:02.959
- and says stupid things--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:03.500 --> 21:04.875
My dad's not the problem.

21:05.625 --> 21:06.917
Yours is.

21:07.000 --> 21:07.959
I mean, yeah.

21:08.041 --> 21:11.291
My dad is a problem, but not this problem.

21:12.166 --> 21:14.959
Well, I can't believe
you're saying bad things about my dad.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.834
Daddy? Let's go!

21:18.500 --> 21:19.375
What's wrong, honey?

21:19.458 --> 21:20.583
I want to go.

21:20.667 --> 21:21.750
Gabe's a jerk.

21:22.625 --> 21:24.208
Oh, oh, yeah? Well...

21:24.291 --> 21:26.208
You don't smell like flowers anymore!

21:27.041 --> 21:28.333
Good one.

21:28.417 --> 21:29.542
Wasn't it?

21:34.250 --> 21:35.583
Wow.

21:35.667 --> 21:36.875
This is a shock.

21:36.959 --> 21:39.458
Hey, I guess this is it for us, too, huh?

21:39.542 --> 21:41.250
Just because the kids
aren't seeing each other

21:41.375 --> 21:42.709
doesn't mean that we can't.

21:42.792 --> 21:44.709
Hey, I got a great idea.

21:44.792 --> 21:46.166
Let's go camping.

21:46.250 --> 21:48.166
Hey, I got a better idea.

21:51.125 --> 21:52.458
Randy: What is it?

21:59.375 --> 22:00.417
Well, Charlie.

22:00.500 --> 22:02.166
Um, once again,

22:02.250 --> 22:04.166
Mom interfered with one of my activities,

22:04.250 --> 22:06.792
but this time she actually helped.

22:06.875 --> 22:09.500
Yeah, thanks to her,
the team really bonded.

22:09.583 --> 22:10.834
and, uh,

22:10.917 --> 22:15.083
we'll have a chance to bond even more
at our court-ordered community service.

22:19.709 --> 22:20.750
Hello?

22:21.834 --> 22:22.875
Who?

22:23.542 --> 22:25.208
Bob-a-lama-ding-dong?

22:26.625 --> 22:27.709
I’m not here.

22:27.792 --> 22:29.583
Oh, yes you are!

22:32.875 --> 22:36.458
Well, it looks like Bob-a-lama-ding-dong
has a new friend.

22:38.542 --> 22:39.875
Ooh.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.291
Wish him good luck, Charlie.

22:46.667 --> 22:48.959
Teddy, honey, it's not true.

22:49.041 --> 22:51.458
Those girls were just being mean.

22:51.542 --> 22:53.041
Teddy: Are you sure?

22:53.125 --> 22:54.917
Yes, I’m sure.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.750
You do not have a big head.

23:02.792 --> 23:04.083
You're not just saying that?

23:04.750 --> 23:06.750
No. No.

23:07.500 --> 23:10.917
Lots of families have to have
their doors widened.

23:12.500 --> 23:13.625
It's just that lately

23:13.709 --> 23:16.959
I’ve been feeling like
it's bigger than usual.

23:19.250 --> 23:20.417
Well, that's because

23:20.500 --> 23:22.709
you've been spending too much time
with your brothers.

23:22.792 --> 23:24.208
Hey, guys. What's going on?

23:27.250 --> 23:28.417
What you looking at?
