00:03.971 --> 00:07.208
Previously on ER:

00:08.442 --> 00:10.044
PRATT:
I never wanted to be
around this type

00:10.044 --> 00:11.212
of suffering.
I mean who would?

00:11.212 --> 00:12.613
I'm glad I came here.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.515
Glad you came, too.
I've been evaluated

00:14.515 --> 00:16.484
by the Impaired Physicians'
Committee, and you know what?

00:16.484 --> 00:17.685
I'm in the clear.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.387
You better start
showing me some respect.

00:19.387 --> 00:20.788
Getting any sleep?
Bobby, I'm not doing this.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.390
What time you going home
tonight?

00:22.390 --> 00:24.458
I haven't been getting
any sleep lately.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.428
And the thing is
that I've been really,
really needing some.

00:27.428 --> 00:30.098
BARNETT:
I wish I didn't feel
how I feel.

00:30.098 --> 00:31.799
You're the best friend
I've ever had.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.401
Neela, I am
a soldier, remember?

00:33.401 --> 00:35.369
And you're also a husband,
remember that?

00:57.525 --> 00:59.427
( gunfire )

01:01.395 --> 01:03.331
( gunfire )

01:09.337 --> 01:11.472
( yelling )

01:13.541 --> 01:15.543
One of the
drivers got hit!

01:32.426 --> 01:33.627
( gunfire stops )

01:33.627 --> 01:36.830
Corporal Milton,
can you hear me?!

01:36.830 --> 01:38.599
Okay, you're
gonna be okay!

01:42.536 --> 01:44.305
I want you
to hold pressure here.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.474
I just called the CASH.
They're sending a chopper.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.176
That's not
gonna work!
( gunfire )

01:48.176 --> 01:49.777
How far are we from
the aid station?!

01:49.777 --> 01:51.779
Eagle is only about four
kilometers due north!

01:51.779 --> 01:53.447
Okay! Okay!

01:53.447 --> 01:55.516
My count, we'll lift
him up onto the truck!

01:55.516 --> 01:56.417
I want you to
keep pressure

01:56.417 --> 01:57.651
on his neck.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.420
Shouldn't we wait
for the chopper?

01:59.420 --> 02:01.622
He'll bleed out before
they get here! Let's go!

02:01.622 --> 02:03.291
One, two, three!

02:11.532 --> 02:13.534
HODGKINS:
I don't even think
he's breathing.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.569
Just keep holding pressure.
You're doing good.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.350
Pupils are fixed
and dilated, sir.

02:39.427 --> 02:41.895
We can stop.

02:46.667 --> 02:50.271
Thanks for trying, sir.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.240
He just got engaged.

02:54.242 --> 02:57.678
You got a girl
back home, Captain?

02:57.678 --> 02:59.613
Me? Yeah.

02:59.613 --> 03:02.316
I'm married.

03:02.316 --> 03:03.517
My wife Neela
is a doc...

04:00.741 --> 04:03.344
( woman speaking Japanese )

04:07.981 --> 04:10.951
( car alarm sounding )

04:17.591 --> 04:20.560
( clattering )

04:29.036 --> 04:32.005
( footsteps )

04:58.932 --> 05:01.869
( creaking )

05:38.539 --> 05:40.541
Mothers often eat
their own young in the wild,

05:40.541 --> 05:42.776
and we just think
it's part of nature, right?

05:42.776 --> 05:45.446
But when women kill
their children,

05:45.446 --> 05:48.549
it's a crime and we
think they're crazy.

05:48.549 --> 05:49.917
What?

05:49.917 --> 05:51.819
Well, I mean, it just
makes you wonder, right?

05:51.819 --> 05:54.622
Are the lions crazy, too,
or are women like Susan Smith

05:54.622 --> 05:58.759
and Andrea Yates just acting
upon some primitive impulse

05:58.759 --> 06:01.595
that's deep within our
genetic maternal makeup?

06:01.595 --> 06:02.763
Am I interrupting something?

06:02.763 --> 06:04.998
Just some girl talk.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.801
MORALES:
Dennis Young, 34,
assault victim.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.036
Blunt trauma
to the head and face.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.438
LOCKHART:
He mugged?

06:10.438 --> 06:12.039
No, it looked like a
home invasion thing.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.474
They tuned
him up good.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.475
KOVAC:
What's your name, sir?

06:14.475 --> 06:16.544
Uh...

06:16.544 --> 06:17.845
MORALES:
Airway's okay, decent vitals,
moves all extremities.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.680
Pupils are five millimeters
and equal.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.549
MORALES:
There were two kids
in the house with him.

06:21.549 --> 06:22.650
17's bringing them in.

06:22.650 --> 06:23.684
They got worked over, too.

06:23.684 --> 06:24.752
One looks real bad.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.920
Okay, Abby, Trauma One.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.189
Head, facial and c-spine CT
as soon as you can.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.525
And send Sam out here to help,
if you see her.

06:31.525 --> 06:32.460
Okay.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.627
BARNETT:
Get out of here.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.463
I swear. She invited
me in for a drink.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.498
Door wasn't even closed, she
was tearing my clothes off.

06:37.498 --> 06:40.868
Yeah, right.
To quote my man Rick James,
the girl is a super freak.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.637
* Super freak, she's
super freaky, yow! *

06:43.637 --> 06:45.706
She had sex toys I've
never even seen before.

06:45.706 --> 06:46.940
They must have been
German or something.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.709
One took two
hands to operate.

06:48.709 --> 06:49.743
Morris...
Check it out.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.012
Oh, yeah. I
tapped that.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.547
What exactly
am I looking at?

06:53.547 --> 06:54.548
That's Albright.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.684
Where?
Right there.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.952
I've seen more convincing
photos of bigfoot.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.589
But, but it was dark.
I couldn't use the flash.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.123
HOLLIS:
Any chance he's gonna
be able to talk to us?

07:03.123 --> 07:05.726
I don't think so.
Enlighten me, ladies.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.595
Looks like we've got an open
skull and facial fractures.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.196
HOLLIS:
We got nothing to go on.
Nobody saw anything.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.764
MORRIS:
Glasgow Coma Scale?

07:10.764 --> 07:11.765
LOCKHART:
Spontaneous eye opening.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.000
( groaning )

07:13.000 --> 07:14.602
Hey, what's he trying to say?

07:14.602 --> 07:15.903
He's altered.
I don't think he knows

07:15.903 --> 07:17.771
what he's saying.
Withdraws from pain.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.072
For a grand total of...
12.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.107
And we incubate at...

07:20.107 --> 07:21.809
GCS of nine.
Excellent.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.143
Any blood
in the belly, Abby?

07:23.143 --> 07:25.045
We were focusing on
the primary survey.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.214
If I wanted excuses, Morris,
I'd ask you directly.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.682
Give me the sonosite.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.620
ALBRIGHT:
Any idea why CT scan
on your trampoline guy,

07:32.620 --> 07:34.655
Margolis, never got
to the OR?

07:34.655 --> 07:36.089
I'll have a tech
run them up.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.758
Dubenko wants you
to personally bring them up.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.059
Hang a gram
of vancomycin.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.528
Is this about
the oral contrast?

07:40.528 --> 07:41.529
I have no idea.

07:41.529 --> 07:42.630
You know, oral contrast

07:42.630 --> 07:43.797
increases the risk
of anesthesia.

07:43.797 --> 07:44.798
If you want
my professional opinion,

07:44.798 --> 07:45.899
I'd find those CT results,

07:45.899 --> 07:47.535
and haul my
ass up there.

07:47.535 --> 07:48.035
MORRIS:
After we stabilize
the patient.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.637
No. Now.

07:49.637 --> 07:50.638
LOCKHART:
Neela, we got
this, okay?

07:50.638 --> 07:51.639
Belly's clear.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.173
Call me after the scan, Moe.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.643
And have Neurosurg
and Head and Neck take a look.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.780
Did she just call you Moe?

07:59.780 --> 08:02.249
It's a nickname...

08:02.249 --> 08:03.250
for Morris.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.652
Or homo.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.787
Hey, don't
worry, okay?

08:06.787 --> 08:08.922
That little vixen's
getting punished tonight.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.257
Oh, yeah.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.659
She's in store
for a little...

08:11.659 --> 08:13.894
* Mo-Mo-Morris

08:13.894 --> 08:16.597
* How do you like it,
how do you like it *

08:16.597 --> 08:18.766
* Oh, yeah, Morris...

08:18.766 --> 08:21.201
Hey, stranger.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.269
Welcome back,
Dr. Pratt.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.571
Thanks.

08:23.571 --> 08:24.171
Glad to see
you survived.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.739
How was it?

08:25.739 --> 08:27.775
Well, hot, sweaty,
fly-infested, you know.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.843
But it was a little
overwhelming to be honest.

08:29.843 --> 08:30.878
Save a lot of lives?

08:30.878 --> 08:32.613
I tried.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.147
PICKMAN:
Three-year-old Eddie.
Good pulses.

08:34.147 --> 08:35.716
BP: 100/50.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.049
Decided to stop breathing
as we pulled in.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.751
Can you open your eyes?
Eddie?

08:38.751 --> 08:40.587
PRATT:
He's posturing.
Little guy was awake

08:40.587 --> 08:42.823
on the scene, but now this is
all we can get out of him.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.091
Okay, Sam,
you're with me.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.893
He's bradying down.
Probable head bleed.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.194
30 migs of mannitol.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.730
Call CT and let's get
neurosurg down here.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.065
BARDELLI:
This is Sean, ten years old,
blunt trauma face and chest.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.701
Tachy at 135. BP's good.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.268
100% on room air.
PRATT:
How you doing, Sean?

08:55.268 --> 08:56.303
I'm Dr. Pratt.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.905
I want to stay with Eddie.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.807
He's scared
when I'm not with him.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.809
We'll have you in the room
right next to him.

09:01.809 --> 09:02.976
Come on. Let's go.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.146
Damn it. The IV blew.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.782
Tube.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.183
TAGGART:
Who did this?

09:10.183 --> 09:12.119
( Clemente groans )

09:12.119 --> 09:15.055
Must have been the same guys
who busted up the pops.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.290
Looks like the work
of meth heads.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.859
What's this kid's story?

09:18.859 --> 09:21.895
Three-year-old,
hypertensive and bradycardic.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.832
Looks like traumatic
head injury.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.900
Okay, I'm in.
Bag him at a rate of 40.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.770
Pupils dilated,
left greater than right.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.705
Step-offs? Hematomas?

09:31.705 --> 09:32.706
Could be head trauma.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.877
All right.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.779
Retinal hemorrhage.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.781
Definitely head trauma.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.650
Call Neurosurg
and get mannitol on board.

09:42.650 --> 09:43.817
Already done that, Vic.

09:43.817 --> 09:44.852
Pulse hanging
in the 60s.

09:44.852 --> 09:46.654
I still don't have a line.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.856
Okay, throw me an IO needle.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.724
You don't want
to do that, trust me.
Oh, yeah?

09:50.724 --> 09:53.861
I do. Betadine.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.195
The IO drill's
the greatest, man.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.296
Wait till you see this.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.765
We don't have
the pedes model.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.332
Yeah, we do; we got
it in last week.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.868
I'm gonna show you

10:00.868 --> 10:02.836
how to drive this baby.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.005
( drill whirring )

10:06.073 --> 10:07.941
Vic, let me do it.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.276
No, I got it.
Come on, man.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.244
I got it.
I got it.
I got it. Hey, Vic!

10:11.244 --> 10:13.046
Come on, okay. I got it.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.048
Okay, I'll talk you through it.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.784
Tibial tuberosity,

10:16.784 --> 10:18.251
one-finger breadth medial,
one-finger breadth medial.

10:18.251 --> 10:19.920
That's what it is.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.922
One-finger breadth medial--
listening to me?

10:21.922 --> 10:23.423
TAGGART:
He's seizing.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.925
KOVAC:
Two of Ativan.

10:24.925 --> 10:25.993
I can't; I don't have access.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.829
Hold on. Hold on.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.965
CLEMENTE:
There you go. That's it.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.201
Okay, now you do.

10:34.201 --> 10:36.003
Nice job. Get a head CT.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.438
Okay, what's
wrong with you?

10:38.438 --> 10:40.941
Me? I'm trying to
help you. That's all.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.976
You don't listen
to a word anybody says.

10:42.976 --> 10:46.980
You're all over
the place.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I was... I just

10:46.980 --> 10:48.315
didn't get a lot
of sleep last night, okay?

10:48.315 --> 10:49.850
Seizing stopped.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.452
150 of Dilantin and pack up
for the scanner.

10:52.452 --> 10:53.887
Outside.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.856
What?

10:55.856 --> 10:56.990
Now!

10:56.990 --> 10:58.792
( scoffs )

11:02.830 --> 11:05.265
What?

11:05.265 --> 11:07.034
What are you on?

11:07.034 --> 11:08.869
I'm not on anything.

11:08.869 --> 11:11.972
I just told you, all I needed
was a cup of coffee. That's all.

11:11.972 --> 11:14.107
What? What?
Do you want a drug test?

11:14.107 --> 11:15.809
You want a drug test right here,
right now? Go ahead.

11:15.809 --> 11:16.944
Grab a cup, baby.
Come on. Come on, baby.

11:16.944 --> 11:19.046
Grab a cup.
Okay, okay, look.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.048
Why don't you take
20 minutes, and get
yourself together? Huh?

11:21.048 --> 11:22.783
What? Because I repeated
an order, man?

11:22.783 --> 11:25.018
Come on, please.
What are you? My moms?

11:25.018 --> 11:26.286
Luka!
Frank, not now.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.788
Look, you're
an attending.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.022
I need you to
be on the ball.

11:29.022 --> 11:29.957
Vic, I'm serious.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.491
Yeah, I'm serious, too.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.060
You're seriously starting
to piss me off. Okay?

11:33.060 --> 11:34.461
'Cause if you don't want
to work with me,

11:34.461 --> 11:36.764
that's fine, man.
I don't need you.

11:36.764 --> 11:39.032
Vic... Vic.
FRANK:
Dr. Kovac.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.467
What, Frank?

11:40.467 --> 11:43.971
These gentlemen are looking
for Dr. Rasgotra.

11:43.971 --> 11:47.775
One of them is
a military casualty officer.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.447
Sats are falling: 89.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.049
BARNETT:
Can't see the cords.
There's too much blood.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.150
We need a surgical airway.
Crike tray.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.518
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow your roll.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.287
Open up a central line kit.
Abby, grab a MacGill.

12:00.287 --> 12:01.889
We're gonna do
a retrograde intubation.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.490
I've never seen that work.

12:03.490 --> 12:04.925
That's because you've never seen
me do it, junior,

12:04.925 --> 12:06.193
but today's your lucky day.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.295
We're going to do
a Seldinger technique.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.930
We're gonna wire up
through the cricothyroid.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.431
I think it'd be faster
just to crike him.

12:11.431 --> 12:12.399
No, 'cause you're gonna
get all kinds

12:12.399 --> 12:13.834
of infection and bleeding,

12:13.834 --> 12:14.935
not to mention
subglottic stenosis

12:14.935 --> 12:15.869
and a big,
ugly-ass scar.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.270
BARNETT:
Sats down to 84.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.405
You know, hypoxia's not
so good for you, either.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.539
Where's Neela?

12:19.539 --> 12:20.874
She got called
up to Surgery.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.275
Okay, we'll
aspirate air

12:22.275 --> 12:24.311
and then,
we'll pass the wire through.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.345
There are soldiers
looking for her,

12:25.345 --> 12:27.314
and one of them is a chaplain.

12:27.314 --> 12:30.150
You need to find her.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.085
Yeah, I'm trying to page her.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.022
Everything okay in here, Abby?

12:35.022 --> 12:36.256
Yeah, I think so.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.557
You know,
we'd be doing a lot better

12:37.557 --> 12:38.859
if you'd stop talking
to the residents

12:38.859 --> 12:40.393
when I'm trying to show them

12:40.393 --> 12:42.329
how to save
this guy's life.
Listen, Vic...

12:42.329 --> 12:43.430
Look, I'm all over this, Kovac.
I'm serious.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.431
Go find Neela, please.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.399
Okay, Abby, look
for the wire

12:46.399 --> 12:48.435
in the oropharynx.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.337
I can't see it.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.471
You will. You will.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.307
Just come on,
you son of a bitch.

12:54.307 --> 12:55.342
( sniffing )

12:55.342 --> 12:57.177
Damn it!

12:58.278 --> 13:00.247
Come on.
Got it.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.585
Hey, can you get this
CT to Dr. Dubenko?

13:05.585 --> 13:07.320
I think he wants
to see you.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.389
Yeah, well, I've just been
paged back to the ER,

13:09.389 --> 13:11.925
so if you can just make sure
that he gets them...
He was very specific

13:11.925 --> 13:13.193
about speaking with you
in person.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.431
BARNETT:
Sat is 78, bradying down to 60.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.233
I still can't see your wire.
Open up a crike tray.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.368
No, no, we don't need
no damn crike tray.

13:21.368 --> 13:22.870
Vic!
Stop staring at me.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.304
Just focus on your patient.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.039
Ray, give her more suction.
It's got to be there.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.877
Wait, wait, wait!

13:29.877 --> 13:32.880
I got it, I got it, I got it.
All right, keep going,
come on.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.181
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

13:34.181 --> 13:35.615
It'll guide you
right through the cords.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.918
Okay, that's enough, Chuny.
Thank you..

13:41.021 --> 13:42.022
Hard to pass.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.223
Wiggle it, mamí.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.325
Side-to-side,
wiggle it, wiggle it.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.327
Okay, I think I'm in.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.595
All right, wire out
and bag him.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.063
Call for a portable chest.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.331
All right, we all good here?

13:51.331 --> 13:52.532
Yeah,
we're doing great.
Abby?

13:52.532 --> 13:54.167
Why you asking her?

13:54.167 --> 13:55.535
I mean, I just told you
we're doing good, right?

13:55.535 --> 13:58.238
I'm going to go find Neela.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.440
Can you believe this?
Ridiculous, huh?

14:00.440 --> 14:02.175
DUBENKO:
What percentage
of liver injuries

14:02.175 --> 14:04.144
have stopped bleeding
by the time

14:04.144 --> 14:05.913
surgical exploration
is performed?

14:05.913 --> 14:07.514
About half?
How about 86%?

14:07.514 --> 14:09.983
It's okay. You have plenty
of time to learn all that

14:09.983 --> 14:11.584
in the next five years.
What?

14:11.584 --> 14:13.253
Well, it seems like
all my complaining

14:13.253 --> 14:14.654
has finally paid off.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.256
We've been funded
for an additional slot

14:16.256 --> 14:17.457
in the surgical
residency.

14:17.457 --> 14:18.425
It's yours
for the asking.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.460
Are you serious?

14:20.460 --> 14:23.263
Well, if you don't
want it...
No, I want it.
I want it!

14:23.263 --> 14:24.631
I'm sorry. It's the ER.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.066
Ignore it.
You're a surgeon.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.334
We never answer
on the first page.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.368
I'm kidding. Go!

14:28.368 --> 14:29.937
Come find me
after your shift.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.438
We'll grab beer at Ike's
to celebrate.

14:31.438 --> 14:32.505
Yeah, that
would be great,

14:32.505 --> 14:34.274
but the drinks are on me.

14:34.274 --> 14:35.542
WOMAN:
So...

14:35.542 --> 14:37.544
I guess congratulations
are in order.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.412
Uh, yes, thank you.
Dr. Dubenko just told me.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.548
I'm so excited.
I can't wait to get started.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.483
Yeah, it's going
to be fun.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.318
I'm really looking forward
to being your attending.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.387
Right. Wonderful.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.692
Neela, uh,
Luka's looking for you.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.194
Yeah, I got his page.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.563
Hey, guess what?
I got surgical residency.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.965
Wow, that's great.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.399
Uh, you should really try
to find Luka.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.534
Yeah, I will.
Neela, hold up.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.436
I need to talk to you.
I got it.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.638
What?
Surgical residency.

15:05.638 --> 15:08.141
That's good for you.
That's really great.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.443
Well, try to contain
your enthusiasm.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.345
Listen, I need
to tell you something.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.480
Yeah, Luka's paging me.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.282
I know,
because it's important.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.517
Well, so is my news,
but nobody seems to care.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.320
Neela, listen...
It's not like I'm leaving
the hospital or anything.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.989
I'm going into surgery.

15:21.989 --> 15:24.091
You'd think you people
would like having me up there.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.225
Abby, have you seen Luka?

15:29.229 --> 15:33.200
There are two men here
to see you... from the Army.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.102
The Army?

15:37.004 --> 15:39.672
BARNETT:
We, um, tried
to find you.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.319
Dr. Rasgotra?

15:52.319 --> 15:54.321
Yes.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.323
I'm Captain Evans.
This is Father Marris.

15:56.323 --> 15:59.359
Is there someplace more
private we can talk?

15:59.359 --> 16:01.461
Can you tell me
why you're here, please?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.596
I really think it
would be better...

16:03.596 --> 16:05.732
Tell me.

16:05.732 --> 16:09.202
Ma'am, the Secretary
of the Army

16:09.202 --> 16:11.604
would like to express
his deepest regret...

16:11.604 --> 16:13.606
Wait. There must be
some mistake.
that your husband,

16:13.606 --> 16:16.043
Captain Michael Gallant,
was killed in action

16:16.043 --> 16:18.545
No, I'm sorry.
You've got it mixed up.
in Iraq on April 29th.

16:18.545 --> 16:21.681
Michael is a doctor.
He's not a soldier soldier.

16:21.681 --> 16:26.119
He was killed when his truck
was hit by a roadside bomb.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.755
Again, the Secretary extends
his deepest sympathies...

16:28.755 --> 16:31.458
I'm sorry.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.626
I'm working.
I can't do this right now.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.214
Please tell Dr. Rasgotra

16:54.214 --> 16:55.782
that we're here to help
in any way possible.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.785
Um, have his parents
been notified?

16:58.785 --> 17:01.588
No, but that's something
we can do if she would like.

17:01.588 --> 17:06.492
What about Michael's, uh,
her husband's remains?

17:06.492 --> 17:08.828
It will take
seven to ten days

17:08.828 --> 17:10.663
for the deceased to
get here from Iraq.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.832
Arrangements will be made
to fly him here to Chicago

17:12.832 --> 17:14.634
or wherever she decides.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.303
Okay, I'll pass that on.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.338
All the pertinent information
is in the packet.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.406
If she has any questions,

17:20.406 --> 17:23.310
she can also contact
myself or Father Marris.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.712
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.314
Hey, was it friendly fire?

17:27.314 --> 17:29.649
Sir?

17:29.649 --> 17:32.385
I mean, how do we really know
what happened over there, huh?

17:32.385 --> 17:34.321
I mean, doesn't this whole war
smell to you

17:34.321 --> 17:36.323
a little bit
of, uh, right-wing cronyism,

17:36.323 --> 17:37.790
with the oil and the
multi-billion-dollar

17:37.790 --> 17:39.759
rebuilding contracts? Huh?
Hey, Vic...

17:39.759 --> 17:40.627
You know what the real
psychological warfare is,

17:40.627 --> 17:42.262
my friend?
Vic...

17:42.262 --> 17:44.297
You coming in here,
feeding us a bunch of lies

17:44.297 --> 17:45.398
to placate the masses, okay?
Vic, shut up!

17:45.398 --> 17:46.766
Tell me about the deficit,

17:46.766 --> 17:48.268
tell me about why do we
have to go over there

17:48.268 --> 17:50.437
and kill everybody
for democracy!
Vic, Vic.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.439
Is that what we're doing?
I need help
with Mr. Engle's blood gas.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.407
Vic.
Excuse me, come on.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.444
LOCKHART:
Sorry.

17:57.444 --> 18:01.148
BARNETT:
I'm gonna go find Neela,
make sure she goes home.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.155
Okay, he's doing better,
so why don't we

18:08.155 --> 18:12.159
lower the FI02
to 70 and...

18:12.159 --> 18:16.229
grab, uh...

18:16.229 --> 18:17.697
grab an ABG in 20, okay?

18:17.697 --> 18:19.332
You want me to look
at your nose?

18:19.332 --> 18:21.801
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Thank you.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.603
Look, I just want
to say I'm sorry, okay?

18:23.603 --> 18:25.305
I'm sorry about what
happened over there,

18:25.305 --> 18:27.574
but those guys coming in
here like storm troopers,

18:27.574 --> 18:29.809
and just...

18:29.809 --> 18:33.280
( coughs )

18:33.280 --> 18:36.183
It's like I'm a stigmata.

18:36.183 --> 18:38.318
Why don't you go crash
in the lounge.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.287
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm really fine.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.821
You know there's no rest
for the wicked.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.523
You, Abby, should know that.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.792
That intubation was cool,
though, wasn't it?

18:45.792 --> 18:49.529
Got to put that in your bag
of tricks, I'm telling you.

18:49.529 --> 18:50.630
( clears throat )

18:50.630 --> 18:51.764
( sniffles )

18:51.764 --> 18:54.201
Look, I got to take care
of this.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.336
( clearing throat )

18:56.336 --> 18:57.737
( sighs )

19:00.873 --> 19:02.709
Hey.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.644
Hey.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.446
Did you find Neela?

19:06.446 --> 19:07.680
Ray's looking for her.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.650
You know,
I came here today

19:10.650 --> 19:13.886
thinking about how nice it is
to be back, you know?

19:13.886 --> 19:16.823
Figured I'd come back
and save a few lives,

19:16.823 --> 19:21.528
maybe even bring somebody back
from the dead, you know?

19:21.528 --> 19:24.497
I damn sure didn't expect
to lose a friend.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.367
Yo, doc.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.835
Ten-year-old won't say anything,

19:28.835 --> 19:30.703
and we got nothing.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.573
Did you find mom?

19:33.573 --> 19:35.875
Yeah, she's been in
rehab since November.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.345
Dad's out of it,
and baby's in a coma.

19:38.345 --> 19:39.479
This kid's all we got.

19:39.479 --> 19:40.613
Can you try
talking to him?

19:40.613 --> 19:43.950
Yeah.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.618
How are we
doing in here?

19:45.618 --> 19:47.720
Oh, kind of quiet.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.957
Hey, man, you want to see
something really, really, cool?

19:53.260 --> 19:55.728
It's your skeleton.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.665
And, uh...

19:58.665 --> 19:59.866
If you look right here,

19:59.866 --> 20:02.302
this is where you broke
your collarbone.

20:02.302 --> 20:06.373
Uh, looks like old
rib fractures.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.679
Do you remember hurting
your ribs?

20:16.316 --> 20:19.486
No?

20:19.486 --> 20:22.355
All right, look, I know
you're worried about your dad

20:22.355 --> 20:23.756
and your little brother,

20:23.756 --> 20:26.693
but we got the best doctors
helping them out.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.895
So now, we need you
to help them, too,

20:28.895 --> 20:30.763
by telling us
what happened.

20:33.766 --> 20:36.503
You do want
to help Eddie, right?

20:36.503 --> 20:39.272
Yeah?

20:39.272 --> 20:41.608
Then you need
to talk to me.

20:43.676 --> 20:46.913
Eddie wanted to play
with my Bionicle guy,

20:46.913 --> 20:50.283
and I took it
away from him.

20:50.283 --> 20:52.585
And he started crying,
and he wouldn't stop,

20:52.585 --> 20:56.489
s-so my dad started
shaking him.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.692
Did your dad hit you?

21:02.629 --> 21:05.465
He punched me,
then threw me into a chair.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.470
And what about your brother?

21:12.772 --> 21:15.007
Eddie kept crying...

21:15.007 --> 21:17.910
and he kept shaking him...

21:17.910 --> 21:22.349
telling him to shut up,
using the "F" word.

21:22.349 --> 21:26.886
And then he grabbed Eddie's head
and slammed it against the wall.

21:26.886 --> 21:31.624
Eddie was crying so hard
that he couldn't breathe.

21:31.624 --> 21:36.596
So I got my baseball bat
and hit him.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.633
You hit your dad?

21:40.633 --> 21:43.736
I wanted him
to leave Eddie alone.

21:46.873 --> 21:48.808
How many times did you hit him?

21:50.643 --> 21:53.613
Until he stopped.

22:04.691 --> 22:08.695
I was just talking
to him four days ago.

22:08.695 --> 22:11.063
He was complaining
about the food,

22:11.063 --> 22:14.501
and I was complaining about
how cold Abby's apartment is.

22:18.505 --> 22:19.706
I honestly
don't even remember

22:19.706 --> 22:22.008
what else we were
talking about.

22:22.008 --> 22:27.580
I'm so sorry,
Neela, I...

22:27.580 --> 22:29.416
We all are.

22:29.416 --> 22:31.718
You know, I was probably
ordering a latte

22:31.718 --> 22:36.656
or watching Celebrity Pokerwhen
he was being blown up by a
bomb.

22:39.759 --> 22:42.462
Just like that, he's gone.

22:42.462 --> 22:46.699
Listen, if you need
anything, um...

22:46.699 --> 22:49.502
or you want me
to do anything...

22:49.502 --> 22:50.937
No, Ray, I don't.

22:50.937 --> 22:53.440
I don't need you to do anything.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.174
I just...
I need to go back to work.

22:55.174 --> 22:56.643
No, no, Neela, look.

22:56.643 --> 22:58.645
You need to go home
and take care of things.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.613
You need to take care
of yourself.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.782
( sobbing ):
You know what?
I don't have a home.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.150
I don't have a husband.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.618
I don't have anything.

23:05.618 --> 23:08.555
All I have is
this stupid hospital.

23:10.590 --> 23:14.026
Just... just stay the hell
away from me.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.640
You hiding?

23:27.640 --> 23:29.909
Is it that obvious?

23:37.016 --> 23:40.587
I can't believe
Michael's dead.

23:40.587 --> 23:42.722
You want to go home?
I'll cover for you.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.123
No. What about Neela?

23:44.123 --> 23:46.025
Well, we can
take care of things.

23:46.025 --> 23:48.227
Who, you and Clemente?

23:48.227 --> 23:50.997
Weaver knew he had problems
before she hired him.

23:50.997 --> 23:52.765
Now we're paying for it.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.768
Well, Luka, it's your ER.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.739
Let's go away someplace.

23:59.739 --> 24:02.775
Where it's warm and where
nobody knows who we are.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.243
Like a vacation?

24:04.243 --> 24:07.514
No, not like a vacation,
a vacation, a real one.

24:07.514 --> 24:09.982
I mean, even if it's just
for a couple of days

24:09.982 --> 24:11.751
before the baby's born.

24:11.751 --> 24:14.654
Can hang out by a pool...
or the ocean.

24:14.654 --> 24:17.657
And I can dig a hole in
the sand for your big belly.

24:17.657 --> 24:21.193
What is that, some sort
of Croatian mating ritual?

24:21.193 --> 24:22.529
Mm-hmm.

24:22.529 --> 24:23.763
What am I, a sea turtle?

24:26.833 --> 24:28.234
Neela.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.674
Neela, hey.

24:34.674 --> 24:36.776
Hey, why don't you
let me take you home?

24:36.776 --> 24:37.977
I have patients
to pass on.

24:37.977 --> 24:38.945
We can take care
of that, Neela.

24:38.945 --> 24:40.647
You need to go home.

24:40.647 --> 24:41.714
Why is everyone so damn
insistent that I go home?

24:41.714 --> 24:43.215
I have things to do.

24:43.215 --> 24:46.152
I haven't even told
Michael's parents yet.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.720
Well, the guys
from the army said

24:47.720 --> 24:49.155
they could
take care of that.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.122
No. I have to do it.

24:50.122 --> 24:51.758
Well,
don't you think

24:51.758 --> 24:53.626
it would be better to do it
from my apartment?

24:53.626 --> 24:54.994
Get some privacy?

24:54.994 --> 24:56.796
You know what, doubtless
they're both at work

24:56.796 --> 24:58.765
and I want to tell them
at the same time

24:58.765 --> 24:59.766
when they're together
tonight.

24:59.766 --> 25:01.233
Neela, go home. Please.

25:01.233 --> 25:03.703
Abby, Dennis Young's
crashing again.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.772
All right, I'll check in
on you later, okay?

25:05.772 --> 25:07.106
Hey, Neela,
I just want to...
Don't.

25:10.777 --> 25:13.913
Um, the men from the army
left a package for you.

25:13.913 --> 25:16.583
Frank has it at the desk.

25:16.583 --> 25:17.149
Neela?

25:17.149 --> 25:18.885
You know what?

25:18.885 --> 25:21.120
If it makes everyone else
happy, I'll go home.

25:24.256 --> 25:26.593
What's going on?

25:26.593 --> 25:27.760
CLEMENTE:
He's bradying down.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.295
Push the damn atropine.

25:29.295 --> 25:31.163
Hey, Abby, you sure
he didn't have an epidural?

25:31.163 --> 25:33.099
Nope, just diffuse
brain edema.

25:33.099 --> 25:34.634
All right,
100 grams of mannitol.

25:34.634 --> 25:35.735
We gave him mannitol.

25:35.735 --> 25:38.671
Bilaterally
blown pupils.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.339
Right. Check the ET tube.
Maybe it came out.

25:40.339 --> 25:42.174
LOCKHART:
No, it's fine.

25:42.174 --> 25:43.142
TAGGART:
GCS 3.

25:43.142 --> 25:44.944
His brain stem is failing,

25:44.944 --> 25:47.313
there's not... a whole lot
we could do about that.

25:47.313 --> 25:48.881
Heart rate's down to 30.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.016
I lost the pulse.

25:50.016 --> 25:50.783
It's PEA.

25:50.783 --> 25:51.951
An amp of epi.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.152
Two angiocaths.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.722
Maybe it's
a tension pneumo.

25:55.722 --> 25:56.823
LOCKHART:
He's satting
on 100%.

25:56.823 --> 25:57.824
Did he get dilantin?

25:57.824 --> 26:00.192
15 per kilo.

26:00.192 --> 26:01.694
All right, champ,
start compressions.

26:02.629 --> 26:03.663
( moves stool )

26:03.663 --> 26:04.931
( clears throat )

26:06.666 --> 26:08.234
Okay, Sam, you call

26:08.234 --> 26:09.736
those compressions?
Come on.

26:09.736 --> 26:11.704
New AHA guidelines.

26:11.704 --> 26:12.238
December issue,
Circulation.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.072
100 per minute,

26:13.072 --> 26:14.774
deeper and faster.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.175
That's how you're going
to save a life, okay?

26:16.175 --> 26:18.210
Okay, I need
to perfuse his brain,

26:18.210 --> 26:20.246
and I need hypertonic saline
at 23.4%.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.914
Well, we don't have that.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.282
We don't have that?

26:23.282 --> 26:24.917
We don't have that?
Hypertonic saline

26:24.917 --> 26:26.753
reduces ICP

26:26.753 --> 26:28.220
when mannitol fails.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.122
That paper last fall
in the, uh... Lancet...

26:30.122 --> 26:32.959
or was it the
New England Journal?

26:32.959 --> 26:34.727
It was Neurosurgery.
That's right.

26:34.727 --> 26:35.928
The author was, uh...

26:35.928 --> 26:37.196
Weston or Williams
or something.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.665
It was a "W." It was...

26:38.665 --> 26:39.832
Wares! That's it. That's it.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.200
Wares.
Neurosurgery,

26:41.200 --> 26:42.034
2004, October.

26:42.034 --> 26:43.135
Hold compressions.

26:43.135 --> 26:44.771
( flatline alarm beeping )

26:44.771 --> 26:46.005
Asystole.

26:46.005 --> 26:47.273
Okay, let's just
call it, Vic.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.975
Call it?

26:48.975 --> 26:50.810
Lockhart, I never figured you
for a quitter.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.311
All right.

26:52.311 --> 26:53.913
He needs Burr holes.
We got to reduce the ICP.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.114
He has an open skull fracture.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.749
Burr holes are not
going to help.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.319
Vic!

27:00.319 --> 27:01.387
( sighs )

27:01.387 --> 27:02.421
Okay, all right.

27:02.421 --> 27:03.289
He should have had
ICP monitor,

27:03.289 --> 27:04.891
and everybody knows it.

27:04.891 --> 27:05.892
He should have had
a damn ICP monitor.

27:05.892 --> 27:07.694
Time of death,
14:20.

27:07.694 --> 27:09.361
Come on. We can do
better than this.

27:09.361 --> 27:12.965
( metal crashing )
We got to do a lot
better than this!

27:12.965 --> 27:14.333
A lot better than that.

27:14.333 --> 27:15.702
Vic, I need
to talk to you.

27:15.702 --> 27:16.869
Yeah, and I need
a cup of coffee,

27:16.869 --> 27:18.871
and not the crap
they serve here in...

27:18.871 --> 27:20.740
or the effluence they try
to pass at the Roach Coach.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.374
I need a real
cup of coffee.
Vic? Hey.

27:22.374 --> 27:23.876
Listen...
You ever been
to this Italian place,

27:23.876 --> 27:25.745
Marrinaccio's,
on Randolph?

27:25.745 --> 27:27.446
Oh, my God, the best coffee
this side of Milan.

27:27.446 --> 27:28.881
They make their
own biscottis.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.449
Man, you walk through
that door, smells...

27:30.449 --> 27:32.318
You know, I'm going
to treat everybody.
Everybody.

27:32.318 --> 27:35.054
I'm going to treat everybody
to espresso and biscotti, okay?

27:35.054 --> 27:36.388
Luka?

27:36.388 --> 27:38.057
48-year-old
complaining of chest pain.

27:38.057 --> 27:39.992
Uh... Exam Three.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.193
Is he on
any medication?

27:41.193 --> 27:42.729
Lipitor and aspirin.

27:42.729 --> 27:43.930
Should I go
get Clemente?

27:43.930 --> 27:45.832
No, uh...
let him go.

27:45.832 --> 27:48.801
Just pick me up as soon
as he comes back.

27:48.801 --> 27:51.838
First day labs, 12 lead,
lopressor and nitro.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.105
Sir, don't worry. We'll
take good care of you.

27:53.105 --> 27:54.173
PRATT:
How many home visits
did DCFS make?

27:54.173 --> 27:55.241
JANE:
One, following...
One!

27:55.241 --> 27:56.743
Following an
accidental scalding

27:56.743 --> 27:58.077
I'll be right in.
several years ago.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.378
So I guess his little brother
accidentally

27:59.378 --> 28:00.947
got his head slammed
up against a wall

28:00.947 --> 28:02.915
today, huh?
Hey.
What's going on?

28:02.915 --> 28:05.785
I got a kid
with a busted collarbone.

28:05.785 --> 28:07.754
He's got signs of old rib
and humerus fractures.

28:07.754 --> 28:09.355
And he's the lucky one!

28:09.355 --> 28:11.858
His little brother's in the room
next to him in a coma.

28:11.858 --> 28:14.026
Did you call
Social Services?

28:14.026 --> 28:15.061
Uh, yeah, they're coming.

28:15.061 --> 28:16.996
We got CTs, MRIs,

28:16.996 --> 28:19.932
PET Scans, Dopplers,
4-D ultrasounds...

28:19.932 --> 28:22.001
but we still can't save
one kid from getting

28:22.001 --> 28:23.269
his brains beaten out.

28:23.269 --> 28:25.104
That's right.
He had to kill his old man

28:25.104 --> 28:27.907
because there was nobody else
there to help him.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.776
I guess that would be too much
to ask, wouldn't it?

28:29.776 --> 28:31.310
I mean... because
it's much better to have...

28:31.310 --> 28:33.145
We spend, what is it now?

28:33.145 --> 28:36.916
$6 billion a month in a war
all the way across the world?

28:36.916 --> 28:38.985
To kill off a few more
of the other kids

28:38.985 --> 28:41.888
who actually
get to make it
to their teens?

28:41.888 --> 28:43.856
Did you tell the police?

28:43.856 --> 28:45.491
So they could arrest him?

28:45.491 --> 28:47.093
Yeah, because that's one thing

28:47.093 --> 28:49.128
we do well in this country,
isn't it?

28:49.128 --> 28:52.799
We got prison down
to a science.

28:52.799 --> 28:54.433
Prison and war.

28:58.437 --> 29:02.141
He and Dr. Gallant
were, um... friends.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.377
God, this coffee's good.

29:05.377 --> 29:07.346
Man, the Italians know
what the hell they're doing.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.548
The French... French press,
anyhow, what the hell is that?

29:09.548 --> 29:11.317
Forget about it.

29:11.317 --> 29:12.484
But I know.

29:12.484 --> 29:13.485
Oh, yeah?

29:13.485 --> 29:14.921
You a killer.

29:14.921 --> 29:15.922
No, no, I'm not a killer.

29:15.922 --> 29:17.323
Jerry Lee Lewis
is a killer,

29:17.323 --> 29:19.826
and you're the mayor
of Munchkin City, pal, okay?

29:19.826 --> 29:22.228
You kill them
in the hospital.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.563
You got blood on you.

29:24.563 --> 29:28.034
Ah, damn,
my nice new shirt.

29:28.034 --> 29:29.535
Right through
the trauma gown.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.370
Ah, man!
I know what you do.

29:31.370 --> 29:33.405
You cut them up
into little pieces...
Okay, pal.

29:33.405 --> 29:35.541
You got to step off, okay?
and feed the surgical
waste to the dogs!

29:35.541 --> 29:37.076
Just step off, please.
You've got to stop
the slaughter.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.544
You know how I got this?
You know how I got this?

29:38.544 --> 29:40.546
Saving someone's life, okay?

29:40.546 --> 29:43.082
'Cause that's what I do: I save
pieces of crap like you, okay?

29:43.082 --> 29:44.083
You crazy...

29:44.083 --> 29:45.852
( tires screeching )

29:45.852 --> 29:47.086
Hey, watch where
you're going, man!

29:47.086 --> 29:48.487
Hey, what are you
doing, man?!

29:48.487 --> 29:49.221
I'm walking here!

29:49.221 --> 29:50.356
You trying to...

29:50.356 --> 29:51.958
Watch where
you going, man!

29:51.958 --> 29:53.192
Hey!
Watch where
the hell you going!

29:53.192 --> 29:54.260
I'm a pedestrian.
I have the right of way!

29:54.260 --> 29:55.561
You're not
even looking!

29:55.561 --> 29:57.129
Listen, hey, you want me
to kick your ass? Huh?

29:57.129 --> 29:58.931
Oh, now you're
gonna kick my ass?
Yeah.

29:58.931 --> 30:00.466
Now you're gonna get
violent on me, right?
Yeah.

30:00.466 --> 30:01.968
You're gonna kick my ass.
Come on, come on, come on.

30:01.968 --> 30:03.102
Kick my ass.
Kick my ass up here, huh?!

30:03.102 --> 30:04.270
Hey!
Try and kick my ass up here!

30:04.270 --> 30:06.205
Hey! What the hell
you doing?!

30:06.205 --> 30:08.908
You gonna go violent on me,
go ahead!
Get off there!

30:08.908 --> 30:11.043
What are you doing?!
Hey, come on! Hey!

30:11.043 --> 30:12.544
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What, are you psycho?!

30:12.544 --> 30:14.246
Psycho?!
Yeah, psycho!

30:14.246 --> 30:15.915
Psycho-- you don't know
about psychosis!

30:15.915 --> 30:17.283
Man, I'm
the freaking doctor!

30:17.283 --> 30:18.384
I'll show you psychosis?

30:18.384 --> 30:19.618
Oh! Oh!

30:19.618 --> 30:21.253
Oh! Oh, God...

30:21.253 --> 30:23.089
That's psychosis, okay!

30:23.089 --> 30:24.190
Hey, come on!
What? Are you on drugs?!

30:24.190 --> 30:25.457
Yeah, I'm high.

30:25.457 --> 30:26.893
I'm wasted.
I'm flipping...

30:26.893 --> 30:28.027
You know, you want
to dip my urine?

30:28.027 --> 30:29.295
Is that what
you want to do?

30:29.295 --> 30:30.963
You want to dip
my urine? Go ahead.

30:30.963 --> 30:33.465
Go ahead.
Oh!

30:33.465 --> 30:34.500
Oh!

30:34.500 --> 30:36.068
Ah!
Yeah, watch out, huh?

30:36.068 --> 30:37.503
I'm gonna get you
all over the place.

30:39.138 --> 30:40.973
Hi, Neela, it's Abby, um...

30:40.973 --> 30:43.109
Uh, I was thinking
about stopping by tonight

30:43.109 --> 30:45.577
on my way to Luka's, and we're
going to get some takeout.

30:45.577 --> 30:48.280
So if there's anything special
you want to eat,

30:48.280 --> 30:51.317
or if you need anything,
just give me a call.

30:51.317 --> 30:53.252
You talked to her?
Tried.

30:53.252 --> 30:54.653
I think she just
wants to be alone.

30:54.653 --> 30:56.422
She's going to have
a lot of time alone.

30:56.422 --> 30:59.091
It's probably best if she was
around people right now.

30:59.091 --> 31:00.326
Yeah, well,
like I said,

31:00.326 --> 31:04.130
I tried,
didn't seem to work.

31:04.130 --> 31:05.197
Whoa. Abby.

31:06.933 --> 31:08.034
Vic?
Sam. Sam.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.535
I got jumped.
I got jumped.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.470
I was going for a cup of coffee
and they ambushed me.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.372
41-year-old male,
altered mental status...

31:13.372 --> 31:14.941
I'm not altered.
You're altered, okay?

31:14.941 --> 31:16.008
There's just no connection
with you.

31:16.008 --> 31:17.376
No... on a human level.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.078
Look, he was wandering
around in traffic--

31:19.078 --> 31:20.312
combative,
uncooperative.

31:20.312 --> 31:21.513
You know why
I'm uncooperative?

31:21.513 --> 31:22.481
Because you're
tying me down.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.016
That's why, man.

31:24.016 --> 31:26.218
What is this, fascist Germany?
1984?

31:26.218 --> 31:27.353
What are we living in?
TAGGART:
Take it easy, Vic.

31:27.353 --> 31:28.387
Why is he in handcuffs?

31:28.387 --> 31:30.289
He assaulted
several motorists.

31:30.289 --> 31:32.491
You know what it is?
It's xenophobia.
That's what it is.

31:32.491 --> 31:33.960
They keep us living in fear.
That's how they do it.

31:33.960 --> 31:34.693
What about
Trauma One?
Full.

31:34.693 --> 31:36.228
It's not a H5 in One.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.329
Exam Two?
Take him
to Exam Two, yeah.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.231
Pulse ox 99
on two liters.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.566
Pulse ox 99?
Ha!

31:40.566 --> 31:42.068
I'm room air,
you mouth breather.

31:42.068 --> 31:43.502
Abby, get them away
from me.

31:43.502 --> 31:44.336
He doesn't know
what the hell he's doing.

31:44.336 --> 31:45.704
Dextrostick 102.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.606
Sam. Sam, tell them
I'm an attending.

31:47.606 --> 31:50.209
Tell them what a colossal
mistake they've made.

31:50.209 --> 31:52.244
Yeah, listen, looks like
you cut your leg, Vic.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.545
Yeah, I did,
but it's superficial.

31:53.545 --> 31:55.181
I can feel the platelets
are already going

31:55.181 --> 31:56.682
to take care of it.

31:56.682 --> 31:59.285
I feel them. I gonna fix that
with a get well sticker.

31:59.285 --> 32:00.686
Well, let's check it out
anyway.

32:00.686 --> 32:02.654
Yeah, come on.
It'll only take a minute.

32:02.654 --> 32:04.090
All right, all right,
okay, okay.

32:04.090 --> 32:05.424
I get it.
It's-It's funny, guys.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.059
The joke's on me.
I get it.

32:07.059 --> 32:09.128
Everybody's laughing?
Okay, now get it off of me.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.262
Okay? Come on.
Get it off me.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.630
Take it off me!
Take it off me!

32:11.630 --> 32:13.065
LOCKHART:
Five of Haldol,
IV push.

32:13.065 --> 32:15.234
Five of Haldol,
IV push.
Hey, hey, hey!

32:15.234 --> 32:17.003
Get it off me!
Where's...?

32:17.003 --> 32:18.404
( panting )

32:18.404 --> 32:20.606
Abby, you can't give me Haldol.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.474
You can't give me Haldol, Abby.

32:22.474 --> 32:24.443
I'm not crazy,
you understand?

32:24.443 --> 32:25.544
It's okay. It's okay.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.146
X-ray, come here, buddy.
Come here.

32:27.146 --> 32:28.547
Come here, buddy.
Come here, buddy.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.182
These freakin' chicks are losing
their mind, man.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.018
Come over here.
Help me, man.
Get Luka.

32:32.018 --> 32:34.053
What are you gonna do,
amputate my leg?!
Take it easy, Vic.

32:34.053 --> 32:35.421
Hey! Oh, that's it.
That's it.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.256
Run to Daddy, you little bitch,
run to Daddy,

32:37.256 --> 32:39.558
little bitch.

32:39.558 --> 32:41.593
Sam, don't you dare.
Don't you dare, Sam.

32:41.593 --> 32:43.762
Sam, don't you dare.
Just try
and relax, okay?

32:43.762 --> 32:45.497
Settle down, Doc.
Settle down.

32:45.497 --> 32:47.166
See, he said it.
He said I'm a doc...

32:47.166 --> 32:49.035
You heard him.
I'm a doc.

32:49.035 --> 32:51.370
I'm a... I'm a freaking doctor,
not a freakin' patient.

32:51.370 --> 32:54.273
Abby? Abby,
I'm your attending.

32:54.273 --> 32:57.043
You hear me?
I'm your attending.

32:57.043 --> 32:59.111
Do no harm, Abby.
Do no harm, Abby!

32:59.111 --> 33:01.113
I know, I know.

33:01.113 --> 33:03.382
I'm an attending at...

33:03.382 --> 33:05.351
( panting )

33:19.698 --> 33:21.400
Hi.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.369
I thought it
would be okay.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.405
Do you mind?

33:26.405 --> 33:27.639
Oh, sure.

33:27.639 --> 33:30.442
Sean, you want
some more Jell-O?

33:30.442 --> 33:31.710
Can I?

33:31.710 --> 33:33.745
Yeah, we got tubs
of it downstairs.

33:33.745 --> 33:36.148
I'll be back in
a few minutes.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.089
Eddie's gonna be hungry
when he wakes up.

33:43.755 --> 33:45.724
( sighs )

33:45.724 --> 33:49.161
You know, since your mom's away,
you're going to have to go stay

33:49.161 --> 33:52.664
with a foster family,
probably until she gets back.

33:52.664 --> 33:54.466
The Fosters?

33:54.466 --> 33:57.103
No, their name's not Foster.

33:57.103 --> 33:59.305
That's what they do.
They take care of kids.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.340
Eddie, too?

34:01.340 --> 34:02.674
No. Eddie's going

34:02.674 --> 34:04.476
to have to stay
in the hospital.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.612
'Cause he's still sick?

34:06.612 --> 34:09.415
He's showing signs
of improvement, though.

34:09.415 --> 34:11.550
And, um, we're gonna have him

34:11.550 --> 34:13.685
in a very special part
of the hospital

34:13.685 --> 34:15.154
that's just for kids.

34:15.154 --> 34:17.123
And you can visit him there.

34:17.123 --> 34:19.225
What about my dad?

34:22.128 --> 34:26.165
His injuries were very...
very severe,

34:26.165 --> 34:29.168
and, um...

34:29.168 --> 34:30.869
the doctors--
they couldn't fix him.

34:30.869 --> 34:34.239
He's dead?

34:36.141 --> 34:39.277
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

34:39.277 --> 34:41.447
But I didn't mean to kill him.

34:41.447 --> 34:43.149
I know that.

34:45.184 --> 34:47.152
But I'm gonna go to hell.

34:47.152 --> 34:48.820
What?

34:48.820 --> 34:50.389
For killing him.

34:50.389 --> 34:52.724
God sends you to hell
if you kill someone.

34:57.229 --> 34:59.231
Sean, I think that

34:59.231 --> 35:00.832
God makes exceptions

35:00.832 --> 35:04.436
if you were trying
to save someone else.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.438
Really?

35:06.438 --> 35:09.841
Really.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.246
How is he?

35:14.246 --> 35:16.682
He's settled down.

35:16.682 --> 35:18.784
Okay, uh, I'm going
to get out of here.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.452
I'm gonna go to my place,
check on Neela.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.888
Okay, call me. Let me
know how she's doing.

35:22.888 --> 35:24.556
Oh.

35:24.556 --> 35:26.325
What's the deal
with Clemente?

35:26.325 --> 35:27.693
Have to hear
what psych says.

35:27.693 --> 35:29.461
Too bad. I was starting
to like the little guy.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.530
Clemente's labs.
Tox screen's negative.

35:31.530 --> 35:32.498
Not so sure
that's a good thing.

35:32.498 --> 35:33.799
Okay, come on, guys.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.367
Let's just give Vic
some privacy.

35:35.367 --> 35:36.602
We still got a
board to clear.

35:36.602 --> 35:38.837
Back to work, everybody.

35:43.409 --> 35:45.944
Do you need me to
sign off on anything?

35:45.944 --> 35:47.379
No.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.549
Everything okay
with you?

35:50.549 --> 35:52.518
Yeah. Why?

35:52.518 --> 35:55.487
Well, sometimes it can be
a difficult transition

35:55.487 --> 35:56.922
coming back to
this place.

35:56.922 --> 35:59.291
No. I'll be okay.

35:59.291 --> 36:01.427
I was just a little rattled
earlier,

36:01.427 --> 36:03.262
'cause of the whole
Mike situation.

36:04.963 --> 36:07.233
Well, good to have you back.

36:08.234 --> 36:09.668
Hey.

36:10.969 --> 36:12.838
Thanks for making me go there.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.742
Some day maybe
you can tell me all about it.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.446
Yeah, some day.

36:26.952 --> 36:27.953
Neela?

36:33.325 --> 36:34.726
Hi.

36:34.726 --> 36:35.794
Hey.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.464
( sniffles )

36:40.366 --> 36:43.669
I brought you some dinner,
some groceries.

36:43.669 --> 36:45.271
Thanks.

36:51.977 --> 36:53.679
Did you call
Michael's family?

36:58.484 --> 37:01.353
Hey, how about I
stay here tonight?

37:03.589 --> 37:06.325
Um, I think
I'd like to be alone.

37:08.394 --> 37:09.461
Really?

37:12.998 --> 37:15.301
I could use a break
from Luka's snoring.

37:18.304 --> 37:20.572
Michael used to snore
when he was drunk.

37:25.444 --> 37:29.681
You know, I had to come home
and find a photograph,

37:29.681 --> 37:31.817
because I couldn't picture him
in my head.

37:38.557 --> 37:39.991
You know, one day
I'm not even going to be able

37:39.991 --> 37:41.793
to remember what he looks like.

37:41.793 --> 37:43.695
That's not true.

37:48.734 --> 37:50.336
I'm-I'm gonna be fine.

37:51.737 --> 37:52.904
Okay.

38:02.348 --> 38:03.582
( quietly ):
I'm sorry.

38:08.487 --> 38:10.556
I'm putting him on a 72-hour.

38:10.556 --> 38:11.623
What are you calling him?

38:11.623 --> 38:12.891
Gravely disabled.

38:12.891 --> 38:14.793
He's blaming it on insomnia.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.828
Tox screen was clean.

38:16.828 --> 38:17.996
Well, there's no history
of schizophrenia

38:17.996 --> 38:19.698
or bipolar disorder,

38:19.698 --> 38:21.367
but he's had prolonged
sleep deprivation,

38:21.367 --> 38:23.835
and was recently the victim
of a violent crime,

38:23.835 --> 38:26.772
so there's probably
some PTSD going on, too.

38:26.772 --> 38:28.106
But we'll know better
in a couple days.

38:28.106 --> 38:30.008
Yeah. Thanks.

38:30.008 --> 38:31.377
Yeah.

38:33.044 --> 38:34.580
( sighs )

38:39.117 --> 38:40.419
Hey, Vic.

38:43.722 --> 38:45.391
What a day you had, huh?

38:45.391 --> 38:47.859
Yeah.

38:47.859 --> 38:48.927
How are you feeling?

38:50.896 --> 38:53.031
I'm pretty good...

38:53.031 --> 38:55.801
considering.

38:55.801 --> 38:57.903
Just feel like such an ass

38:57.903 --> 39:01.607
for flipping out in front
of the kids and everything.

39:01.607 --> 39:03.074
I'm a passionate man.

39:03.074 --> 39:04.776
That's what makes me
a good doctor, right?

39:06.645 --> 39:08.814
Right.

39:08.814 --> 39:10.549
You just can't keep up my pace

39:10.549 --> 39:12.784
without spinning off the road
at some point.

39:14.586 --> 39:17.456
I'm just sorry that it had
to happen on your watch.

39:17.456 --> 39:19.491
That's okay. That's okay.

39:19.491 --> 39:22.861
The important thing is
that you get some rest now.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.096
Yeah, yeah.

39:25.096 --> 39:27.966
I want to get some rest.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.835
Oh, yeah.

39:29.835 --> 39:33.505
I'm going
to get some serious R&R.

39:33.505 --> 39:35.674
Catch up on my sleep,
and maybe do a...

39:35.674 --> 39:37.075
Let me, uh...

39:37.075 --> 39:39.445
Let me take you up...
upstairs, okay?

39:39.445 --> 39:41.913
All right, sure.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.582
Okay?

39:43.582 --> 39:45.451
Yeah.

39:45.451 --> 39:49.120
Personal escort treatment--
I like that.

39:49.120 --> 39:52.691
I appreciate it, Luka.
I really do.

39:52.691 --> 39:55.894
You helping me like this,
and, uh...

39:55.894 --> 39:59.565
Don't be afraid to come up
anytime to see me.

39:59.565 --> 40:02.434
Especially if you need to run
something past somebody, or...

40:02.434 --> 40:06.738
I can still make a diagnosis
on the tough ones, you know?

40:06.738 --> 40:08.907
Take care
of yourself,
okay, Vic?

40:08.907 --> 40:11.577
Yeah. Be cool, man.

40:11.577 --> 40:14.446
Yeah.

40:14.446 --> 40:16.181
Get back to work.

40:47.579 --> 40:50.616
Hey, it's, uh, it's me.

40:50.616 --> 40:52.651
I'm, uh,
getting the camera ready.

40:54.586 --> 40:56.087
Neela, te quiero.

40:56.087 --> 40:58.089
Get out of here, you freak.

40:58.089 --> 40:59.591
MAN ( laughing ):
I love you, Neela.

40:59.591 --> 41:01.092
Get out of here.
Get out of here.

41:01.092 --> 41:03.061
You see
what I got to deal with?

41:03.061 --> 41:04.062
You see that?

41:04.062 --> 41:05.864
( clears throat )

41:05.864 --> 41:07.599
So,

41:07.599 --> 41:10.068
hopefully, you're never going
to see this thing.

41:10.068 --> 41:15.574
But if you are, well, then, um,

41:15.574 --> 41:19.277
you know, something went wrong.

41:19.277 --> 41:23.081
Maybe not wrong, but certainly
not according to plans.

41:27.886 --> 41:30.656
I love you, Neela.

41:30.656 --> 41:32.924
Marrying you was...

41:32.924 --> 41:34.125
the happiest day of my life.

41:35.561 --> 41:36.595
You make me strong.

41:36.595 --> 41:38.229
( sniffles )

41:38.229 --> 41:41.600
Now, I know you didn't want me
to come back to Iraq,

41:41.600 --> 41:43.602
and I guess
if you're watching this,

41:43.602 --> 41:46.271
you owe me a big
"I told you so," but, uh...

41:46.271 --> 41:48.139
but I did what I had to do.

41:50.809 --> 41:53.645
You're the most beautiful
and kind person that I know.

41:55.313 --> 41:58.283
I just... I just want you
to be happy.

41:58.283 --> 42:02.020
And, um, just know
that I'll always be with you.

42:05.223 --> 42:10.228
I want you to find somebody,
get married, have babies.

42:10.228 --> 42:11.763
Of course, he won't be
as fine as me, but...

42:11.763 --> 42:13.331
( laughs )

42:13.331 --> 42:14.933
you know, I guess you'll just
have to live with that.

42:15.967 --> 42:17.803
I love you, Neela.

42:18.303 --> 42:20.138
Forever.
