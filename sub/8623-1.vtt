Honey, wake up.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.607
- No.

Greet the day.

Honey, you gotta wake up.

01:19.705 --> 01:20.789
Ow!

That's it!

01:35.220 --> 01:37.681
Oh!
I have had it!

Anna, hurry up!

01:46.982 --> 01:48.984
What?
I'm ready.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.531
Would you settle on a station?

01:54.615 --> 01:55.741
Okay!

01:55.824 --> 01:58.160
I'm going to get
a little stud here, okay?

01:58.202 --> 02:01.246
I don't want my maid of honor
looking like a harlot.

02:01.330 --> 02:03.540
Come on, Mom.
Everyone's got one.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.751
Everyone?
Harry, everyone has one.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.711

Okay.
If I can drive.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.305
- Did you bring your permit?
- No. I can't find it.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.098
- You can't find it?
- Ha ha!

02:20.182 --> 02:21.975
What did you do with it, troll?

02:22.059 --> 02:24.102
Why do you always have
to blame him?

02:24.186 --> 02:25.854
You couldn't find
anything in your room.

02:25.938 --> 02:28.023
Why do you always take his side?

02:28.065 --> 02:31.693
Oh, look, Anna,
let's not do this now, please.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.403
And fix your shirt.

Thanks a lot.
Say hi to your mom.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.249
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, bye. Hi, girls.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.959
You never see Stacey anymore.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.086
- How is she?
- Evil. She hates me now.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.546
Why?

02:50.587 --> 02:53.382
Would you leave
your brother alone?

02:53.465 --> 02:56.927
See?
She always starts it.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.095
Bye, honey.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.721
Make good choices.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.272
She had the same shirt?

03:08.355 --> 03:10.899
Yeah, but this
looks okay, right?

03:10.941 --> 03:11.900
- Sure.
- Yeah.

03:11.942 --> 03:12.943
So it's cool?

03:15.529 --> 03:17.239
- Oh, kill me.
- Anna, what?

03:17.322 --> 03:19.533
I can't believe it.
It's Jake.

03:19.616 --> 03:22.661
He's gonna think I'm so stupid,
I can't even put on a shirt.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.873
You've never even met the guy.
Guess what? He doesn't care.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.583
He's not even looking.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.126
He's totally looking.

03:29.168 --> 03:31.920
- I think he's gonna talk to you.
- Shut up.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.806
Oh! Thanks.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.183
Sorry.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.768
Why would I want
a leprechaun ice sculpture?

Mr. Bates, I don't
understand this "F".

04:23.680 --> 04:25.557
You missed
the point of the book.

04:25.641 --> 04:27.851
It's "1984."
How could anyone miss it?

04:27.935 --> 04:30.479
It's a blatant attack
on totalitarianism.

04:30.562 --> 04:31.813
About a rigid society,

04:31.855 --> 04:35.984
dominated by one all-powerful,
ego-tripping dictator.

I had some car trouble.

05:16.525 --> 05:19.236
Okay.
I thought you forgot about me.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.864
I could never forget about you.
I see you every day.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.241
What about tomorrow?

05:24.324 --> 05:26.618
Is this new?
Am I gonna see you tomorrow?

05:26.702 --> 05:29.371
You're gonna see me tomorrow,
but not next week,

05:29.454 --> 05:31.748
because I'm going
on my honeymoon.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.042
Oh, my God!
You're not coming back.

05:34.084 --> 05:37.254
- All my therapists quit on me.
- I'm not gonna quit on you.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.590
I'm gonna be available
on my cellphone.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.843
I checked. There's no service
on the north side of the island.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.219
It will be fine.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.929
Okay.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.557
I've had a better week.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.142
You're counting the minutes,
aren't you?

05:50.225 --> 05:51.226
No.

05:52.436 --> 05:53.937
How many minutes are left?

05:53.979 --> 05:55.564
54.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.109
All right,
this morning was good.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.777

No. No, no, no.
Absolutely not.

06:53.664 --> 06:55.374
I said no salmon.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.960
No, it has to be halibut.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.629

about the extra cost.

Hi, Harry.

07:09.054 --> 07:12.015
No, you may not touch
the power tools.

07:12.057 --> 07:16.144
Yes, I would consider the
lawnmower to be a power tool.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.689
Okay.
I'll see you at home.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.649

you are a smart, strong,

Yeah, I'd like that.

thinking less about boys

your honors qualifying exam.

You know, don't worry.
I'll be there.

14:51.725 --> 14:55.270
How can you? Aren't you
the maid of horror or something?

14:55.312 --> 14:57.898
Honor. It's not the wedding.
It's the rehearsal.

14:57.981 --> 14:59.650
Don't they make a big deal
out of the rehearsal,

14:59.733 --> 15:01.777
like all your weird
relatives coming to town?

15:01.818 --> 15:03.487
No, they don't.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.114
There's my Anna Banana!

15:06.198 --> 15:08.784
Give your Grampy Doodle
a big huggy-buggy.

15:09.368 --> 15:11.537
Grandpa, over here.

15:13.163 --> 15:14.540
Oh.

15:16.208 --> 15:17.835
Hey, Gramps.

15:18.627 --> 15:21.088
Don't worry.
I would never let you down.

15:21.171 --> 15:23.465
Just don't cancel
the audition yet.

15:23.507 --> 15:26.301
- I'm gonna talk to my mom.
- All right.

15:26.343 --> 15:28.053
- We're screwed.
- Yep.

15:28.846 --> 15:30.347
Yeah.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.025
"I don't think he knows I exist.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.820
It's stupid to think about him,
but I can't help it."

15:44.862 --> 15:47.489
Jake! Ooh, Jake!

15:47.531 --> 15:49.449
Get out of my room!

15:51.910 --> 15:53.954
Oh! My... my...

15:54.037 --> 15:56.165
Ah! Aaaaah!

15:56.206 --> 15:57.624
She saw it.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.168
I'm gonna check
out those Lakers.

15:59.251 --> 16:00.878
I'm with you.

16:01.879 --> 16:03.463
Mom!

16:03.547 --> 16:06.091
Mom, did you see
what happened to my door?

16:10.095 --> 16:11.555
I spoke to your principal.

16:11.638 --> 16:12.181
What?

16:12.264 --> 16:13.765
Just now on the phone.

16:13.849 --> 16:14.808
Where's my door?

16:14.892 --> 16:17.978
- Privacy is a privilege.
- Where is my door, Mom?

16:18.061 --> 16:20.272
Your door will be
returned to you, Anna,

16:20.355 --> 16:22.774
if and when you can explain...

16:22.858 --> 16:25.736
You give me that door,
or I will kill myself.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.237
Oh!
Can I watch?

16:27.279 --> 16:28.739
- Harry!
- Shut up!

16:28.780 --> 16:30.199
Aaaaah!

16:31.241 --> 16:33.744
I think we can dispense
with the drama.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.871
Maybe you can
calmly explain to me

16:35.913 --> 16:38.457
why you were
in detention twice today.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.000
Okay, I went to detention.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.710
That was
because Stacey Hinkhouse

16:41.793 --> 16:43.754
kept hitting me
with a volleyball.

16:43.795 --> 16:47.633
When is this conflict with
Stacey Hinkhouse going to end?

16:47.716 --> 16:50.552
Never, because she's
an insane, psycho freak.

16:50.636 --> 16:53.222
You'd know that if you paid
a speck of attention.

16:53.263 --> 16:54.056
Anna!

16:54.139 --> 16:54.932
What?

16:55.015 --> 16:57.518
I think you know I pay
attention, Anna.

16:57.601 --> 17:00.729
Enough to know that you got
an "F" in English today.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.689
Well, Mr. Bates
is out to get me.

17:02.731 --> 17:03.941
Oh, him too?

17:04.023 --> 17:05.233
Yeah.

17:05.275 --> 17:07.361
He just looks
for ways to torture me.

17:07.444 --> 17:10.489
Like today, the one time Jake
spoke to me, he totally...

17:10.571 --> 17:12.406
Who's Jake?

17:12.491 --> 17:14.660
He's just nobody.

17:15.828 --> 17:18.121
You say
I'm not interested, Anna.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.165
I'm interested.
Try me.

17:21.959 --> 17:24.795
Okay, he's just this
really amazing guy, Mom.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.547
Where'd you meet him?

17:26.630 --> 17:28.298
Detention, but...

17:28.382 --> 17:29.883
That's promising.

17:29.967 --> 17:31.385
Do you see? Why do I
bother telling you anything?

17:31.385 --> 17:32.886
Do you see? Why do I
bother telling you anything?

17:32.970 --> 17:35.597
Okay.
Who's up for Chinese?

17:35.681 --> 17:37.933
Aah!
You're ruining my life!

17:38.016 --> 17:42.729
I'm moving out and never coming
back ever, ever, ever again!

17:58.036 --> 18:00.289
- Hello. How are you?
- Hello, Pei-Pei.

18:00.330 --> 18:03.792
Anna, Harry, you're so big now.
What happened?

18:03.834 --> 18:05.460
Are you happy for your mommy?

18:05.544 --> 18:06.962
About what?

18:07.004 --> 18:09.798
Oh. [Laughs]
She's such a joker.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.301
Who's catering?
Chinese food good luck.

18:12.342 --> 18:15.637
- It's all planned already.
- Okay, how about me?

18:15.679 --> 18:18.974
- I preordered the Peking duck.
- Joy.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.810
- I know that's your favorite.
- Whatever.

18:21.852 --> 18:24.354
- The wedding is in two days.
- Think about it.

18:24.396 --> 18:26.148
See you soon.
Happy dining.

18:26.190 --> 18:29.318
Anna, your door is
underneath the back stairs.

18:29.401 --> 18:31.862
Like I didn't figure that out.

18:33.322 --> 18:36.158
Stop groveling, man.
Let her come to you.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.994
She'd come with a hatchet.

18:39.077 --> 18:41.497
I think I'll
go check on that duck.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.044
Anna.

18:48.504 --> 18:50.506
Do you think
that your surliness

18:50.589 --> 18:53.467
is the best way for you
to get what you want?

18:57.513 --> 18:59.181
I'm sorry, Mom.

18:59.264 --> 19:01.433
I really have
been stressing in school,

19:01.517 --> 19:05.395
and I deserved every single one
of those trips to detention.

19:05.479 --> 19:09.191
And I'm gonna apologize to
Stacey Hinkhouse and Mr. Bates.

19:09.274 --> 19:13.278
I guess what I'm trying to say
is, I'll try and do better, Mom.

19:13.362 --> 19:15.447
I'll really, really try.

19:15.531 --> 19:17.366
All right, what do you want?

19:17.407 --> 19:19.284
To go to this audition tomorrow

19:19.368 --> 19:21.119
that we can never have
again at the House of Blues.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.663
An audition, that's great.

19:22.746 --> 19:26.500
Tomorrow? You mean
after the rehearsal dinner?

19:26.583 --> 19:29.002
Well, during.

19:29.086 --> 19:31.880
"During."
You mean as "instead of"?

19:31.964 --> 19:32.756
Technically?

19:32.840 --> 19:34.550
I need to talk to you right now.

19:34.633 --> 19:37.052
- I'm gonna pass on that.
- Now!

19:40.013 --> 19:40.764
Anna.

19:41.765 --> 19:44.309
I am going
to make one final attempt

19:44.393 --> 19:46.854
to understand
what goes on in your head.

19:46.937 --> 19:48.730
Don't treat me like
your patients.

19:48.772 --> 19:50.649
- What?
- All calm and reasonable.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.192
Let's talk.
I want to understand.

19:52.276 --> 19:55.362
I really do
want to understand, Anna!

19:55.445 --> 19:56.238
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

19:56.280 --> 20:00.075
Oh, Mama,
stay out of it, please.

20:00.159 --> 20:01.660
- Mama.
- Okay, fine.

20:01.743 --> 20:04.163
They're gonna pick one local
band to play at Wango Tango.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.456
We were lucky to make this cut.

20:06.540 --> 20:09.084
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
chance. Please.

20:09.168 --> 20:11.086
Why can't I just go?
Please.

20:11.128 --> 20:13.463
What I hear
is that my special night

20:13.547 --> 20:15.507
means absolutely nothing to you.

20:15.591 --> 20:18.343
I don't have to ask if my band
means anything to you.

20:18.427 --> 20:20.596
It's clear
you think we're all noise.

20:20.637 --> 20:22.639
Look, I'm a walrus.

20:22.681 --> 20:25.934
- I do not!
- Do too!

20:25.976 --> 20:30.063
Anna, I let you practice
in the garage.

20:30.147 --> 20:31.273
Anna, stop.

20:31.315 --> 20:32.983
What?

20:33.066 --> 20:35.444
Let's talk about what
this is really about.

20:35.527 --> 20:37.196
This is about your dad.

20:37.279 --> 20:40.866
Mom, stop shrinking me.
It's not about Dad.

20:40.949 --> 20:43.744
It's about the audition!
You're ruining my life!

20:43.827 --> 20:45.537
Enough with the drama.

20:45.621 --> 20:47.956
Anna, high school
is not that hard.

20:47.998 --> 20:50.792
You couldn't last one day
in my high school.

20:50.876 --> 20:54.421
I could, and I would do it
without getting a detention.

20:54.505 --> 20:57.633
I'm sorry I'm the one thing
in your life that isn't perfect!

20:57.716 --> 20:59.801
You think my life is perfect?

20:59.843 --> 21:01.553
I know your life is perfect.

21:01.637 --> 21:03.055
Your perfect job,
perfect boyfriend,

21:03.138 --> 21:05.474
perfect patients who worship
the ground you walk on.

21:05.516 --> 21:08.602
You need a serious
and bracing reality check

21:08.685 --> 21:10.479
if you think my life is perfect!

21:10.562 --> 21:12.731
You can cut me some
slack this once.

21:12.814 --> 21:15.192
I am beyond
cutting you slack, Anna.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.236
You are not
going to the audition.

21:17.319 --> 21:18.570
- I am!
- No, you're not!

21:18.654 --> 21:21.406
- Why not?
- Because I said so!

21:21.490 --> 21:23.200
Cookie?

21:26.411 --> 21:28.247
This isn't really a good time.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.165
Now a good time.

21:30.249 --> 21:32.501
[Speaking Chinese]

21:37.422 --> 21:40.717
Okay, okay.
Thank you.

21:44.930 --> 21:49.309
Anna, for one day,
the entirety of our life

21:49.393 --> 21:51.395
is not gonna be
focused on you.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.273
Yeah, it's all about
Ryan now, isn't it?

21:55.941 --> 21:56.692
Anna!

21:56.775 --> 21:58.235
Get away.

21:58.318 --> 21:59.695
Honey!

22:13.000 --> 22:15.210
"A journey soon begins,

22:15.294 --> 22:18.338
its prize reflected
in another's eyes.

22:18.422 --> 22:20.549
When what you see
is what you lack,

22:20.632 --> 22:23.886
then selfless love
will change you back."

22:23.927 --> 22:24.970
Whatever.

22:37.357 --> 22:38.650
Honey?

22:40.194 --> 22:41.445
- You okay?
- Yeah.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.197
Whew.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.573
Come on.

23:03.175 --> 23:05.636
- Did you feel that?
- Feel what?

23:05.677 --> 23:07.930
- There was an earthquake.
- No, there wasn't.

23:08.013 --> 23:09.306
Yes, there was.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.099
What are they talking about?

23:11.141 --> 23:12.434
An earthquake.

23:12.476 --> 23:13.393
An earthquake?

23:13.477 --> 23:15.771
No.
There was no earthquake.

23:15.854 --> 23:17.356
You didn't feel it?

23:17.439 --> 23:21.401
No.
I don't think so.

24:10.742 --> 24:12.703
6:45 already.

24:12.744 --> 24:15.956
Oh, God, I didn't get
the dry cleaning.

24:16.039 --> 24:18.876
I'll have to do that on the way
home, and call the mechanic

24:18.959 --> 24:20.919
and the florist.

24:22.087 --> 24:24.840
Okay, better get up.

24:24.882 --> 24:26.717
I'd better...

24:29.261 --> 24:33.015
Why am I in Anna's room?

24:33.056 --> 24:35.225
What happened last night?

24:35.309 --> 24:37.978
Did I pass out in here?

24:38.061 --> 24:40.689
Oh, I have no memory of this!

24:40.731 --> 24:42.733
This isn't mine!

24:44.234 --> 24:46.111
Those aren't mine!

24:46.195 --> 24:47.821
That's not mine.

24:50.574 --> 24:53.494
That's definitely not mine.

24:58.248 --> 25:00.751
Aaaaah!

25:00.834 --> 25:03.128
Anna, come here quick.

25:03.212 --> 25:04.546
Mom's dead.

25:04.588 --> 25:05.923
I'm dead?

25:11.261 --> 25:13.055
Come on, hurry!

25:16.975 --> 25:19.561
See?
She's not moving.

25:19.645 --> 25:21.897
Oh, my God.

25:21.939 --> 25:24.650
No, wait, it's breathing.

25:24.733 --> 25:25.817
I'm not dead.

25:25.901 --> 25:27.236
What?

25:29.613 --> 25:34.368
Right.
Her chest is moving, honey, see?

25:35.285 --> 25:37.371
You called me "honey."

25:37.454 --> 25:38.914
Right...

25:39.498 --> 25:41.250
Are you sick?

25:41.291 --> 25:42.709
I hope so.

25:42.793 --> 25:45.420
Or dreaming.

25:45.504 --> 25:47.130
Hon.

25:47.214 --> 25:49.424
Harry,
go get your own breakfast.

25:49.466 --> 25:51.593
You can eat Anna's cereal.

25:51.677 --> 25:52.636
My cereal.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.012
Cool.

25:58.934 --> 26:00.561
Hello?

26:02.062 --> 26:04.189
Hello in there?

26:04.273 --> 26:06.358
Wake up, honey.

26:06.441 --> 26:08.318
Wake up.

26:08.402 --> 26:10.279
Wake up!

26:10.988 --> 26:11.822
That is it.

26:11.905 --> 26:13.699
[Groaning] Oh.

26:24.751 --> 26:30.215
Oh, could I just have,
like, one minute, please?

26:30.299 --> 26:32.301
Honey.

26:32.384 --> 26:35.304
Look, I think
something's happened to us.

26:35.971 --> 26:37.806
What are you?

26:37.848 --> 26:40.142
It's me. Mom.

26:40.184 --> 26:41.643
You're not my mother.

26:41.685 --> 26:44.479
Yes, I am.

26:44.521 --> 26:46.148
Get away, you clone freak!

26:46.190 --> 26:49.234
Don't you use that tone with me.

26:49.318 --> 26:51.486
Oh, my God, you are my mother.

26:51.570 --> 26:54.156
And you're not
who you think you are.

27:02.748 --> 27:04.291
Look at me!

27:04.374 --> 27:06.043
We seem to be inside each other.

27:06.126 --> 27:07.878
I'm old!

27:07.961 --> 27:09.588
I beg your pardon!

27:09.671 --> 27:12.508
Oh, I'm like the Cryptkeeper!

27:12.549 --> 27:14.593
Okay, that's enough.

27:14.676 --> 27:19.640
Aah!

27:19.723 --> 27:21.225
I want my body back.

27:21.308 --> 27:24.186
And I don't want mine?
My wedding's tomorrow.

27:24.228 --> 27:26.230
Oh, my God!
My wedding's tomorrow.

27:26.313 --> 27:28.565
I can't marry Ryan.
Ew!

27:28.649 --> 27:31.109
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

27:31.193 --> 27:32.736
Okay what?

27:32.819 --> 27:34.279
I have no idea.

27:34.363 --> 27:37.241
Mom, maybe we should go
to the emergency room.

27:37.324 --> 27:37.908
Oh, no.

27:37.991 --> 27:40.244
All that will get us
is a 72-hour lockdown

27:40.327 --> 27:42.579
in the psych ward
and a Thorazine drip.

27:42.663 --> 27:45.040
No, we're not going anywhere.

27:45.082 --> 27:45.958
Okay.

27:48.293 --> 27:51.755
So you're in my body,
and I'm in your body.

27:51.797 --> 27:53.048
Why don't we, like...

27:53.090 --> 27:55.509
Yes, yes, I see
what you're saying.

27:55.592 --> 27:56.885
A jolt.

27:56.969 --> 27:59.972
Okay. You go over there,
and I go over here.

28:00.722 --> 28:03.183
Okay, now when I say go.
Ready?

28:03.267 --> 28:05.102
- Yeah.
- Go.

28:05.811 --> 28:07.646
Hey, Mom, can I...

28:10.774 --> 28:13.944
Okay.
Okay, that was stupid.

28:15.195 --> 28:17.322
Harry!

28:17.406 --> 28:21.702
I was just teaching
Mom some new dance moves.

28:21.785 --> 28:23.704
What do you want, punk?

28:27.207 --> 28:29.209
You cannot talk to him
like that.

28:29.293 --> 28:30.586
He thinks you're his mother.

28:30.627 --> 28:32.754
We're gonna to have to tell him.

28:32.796 --> 28:35.591
We're not going to tell anyone.

28:35.632 --> 28:37.968
They'll think we're crazy.

28:38.051 --> 28:39.678
Maybe we are crazy.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.305
I for one am not crazy.

28:41.388 --> 28:45.100
I'm merely a grown woman
trapped in my daughter's body.

28:46.685 --> 28:49.021
Oh, God, I am crazy.

29:02.993 --> 29:04.828
Grandpa,
could you pass the milk?

29:04.912 --> 29:09.249
Okay. Harry's still Harry,
and Grandpa's still Grandpa.

29:09.333 --> 29:11.460
So it's just us.
What did we do wrong?

29:11.502 --> 29:12.377
I don't know.

29:12.461 --> 29:15.923
Grandpa, pass the milk!

29:16.006 --> 29:18.050
Grandpa, pass the milk!

29:18.133 --> 29:19.134
Earthquake.

29:19.218 --> 29:20.677
Earthquake!

29:20.761 --> 29:21.762
Earthquake?

29:21.845 --> 29:22.888
House of Chang!

29:22.971 --> 29:25.265
- Nobody felt it but us.
- Earthquake!

29:25.349 --> 29:28.477
Earthquake, earthquake!

29:28.560 --> 29:30.020
Honey!

29:33.232 --> 29:34.525
Okay.

29:34.608 --> 29:36.193
I'll take you.

29:37.861 --> 29:40.656
I guess you're not ready yet.

29:43.951 --> 29:46.119
Sweetheart.

29:46.203 --> 29:47.538
What are you doing here?

29:47.621 --> 29:50.499
I thought you said
you needed a ride to work.

29:50.582 --> 29:53.043
Right, Mom.

29:53.126 --> 29:55.212
I guess you better hurry up.

29:55.295 --> 29:57.047
Get a grip.
I am not...

30:02.719 --> 30:04.179
Darling.

30:05.806 --> 30:08.600
Could you,
like, chill for a sec?

30:09.685 --> 30:13.146
Sure, sure, I'll chill.

30:13.230 --> 30:16.525
- You're going.
- I'll, like, go get your dad.

30:16.608 --> 30:19.152
Alan, that's not our car!

30:19.236 --> 30:21.864
The earthquake and then
Pei-Pei's crazy mother

30:21.905 --> 30:23.365
pointing at me and you.

30:23.407 --> 30:26.034
And what was she
mumbling about in Chinese?

30:26.118 --> 30:29.705
She did something.
Some strange Asian voodoo.

30:29.746 --> 30:33.041
What are we gonna do now?
I can't go to school like this.

30:33.125 --> 30:34.042
You have to.

30:34.126 --> 30:36.044
You're on the verge
of suspension,

30:36.128 --> 30:39.089
and you have your honors
qualifying exam today.

30:39.173 --> 30:41.800
All the more reason
to stay home.

30:42.467 --> 30:45.220
I could go and
take the exam for you.

30:45.304 --> 30:47.931
I'm sure a high test
would be simple for me.

30:48.015 --> 30:51.560
Are you kidding?
You think you can be me?

30:51.643 --> 30:53.687
Of course I can.
Watch me.

30:53.770 --> 30:57.691
"Oh, everyone's out to get me.
You're ruining my life."

30:57.774 --> 30:59.067
It's easy to be you.

30:59.109 --> 31:01.111
I'll suck the fun
out of everything.

31:01.153 --> 31:02.821
I do not suck the fun
out of everything.

31:02.905 --> 31:04.907
- Fun sucker.
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

31:04.990 --> 31:08.285
I will go to school,
and you will stay right...

31:08.368 --> 31:09.912
- What?
- Evan.

31:09.995 --> 31:12.789
- Evan? Who's Evan?
- My neediest patient.

31:12.873 --> 31:15.334
I've been seeing him every day
for three years.

31:15.417 --> 31:16.877
Ooh, bummer.

31:17.878 --> 31:20.380
Maybe just my face
would be reassuring.

31:20.464 --> 31:21.548
No way. Unh-unh.

31:21.632 --> 31:25.260
I am not babysitting
some 40-year-old wack job.

31:25.302 --> 31:26.970
What am I supposed
to say to the freak?

31:27.054 --> 31:30.682
Nothing. You are in no way
to give anyone any advice.

31:30.766 --> 31:31.767
That would be unethical.

31:31.850 --> 31:34.728
Just listen attentively,
nod occasionally,

31:34.811 --> 31:36.688
and if you must speak,
simply say,

31:36.772 --> 31:39.316
"How do you feel about that?"

31:39.399 --> 31:41.193
You're serious.

31:41.276 --> 31:43.821
You really
want us to be each other?

31:43.904 --> 31:46.698
We will get through
this morning as each other,

31:46.782 --> 31:49.618
and we will go to the restaurant
at lunch and get switched back.

31:49.701 --> 31:51.119
Go get dressed.

31:51.995 --> 31:54.832
Well, good luck getting
dressed without a door.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.836
Thank you.

31:58.919 --> 32:00.879
[Anna screaming]

32:02.506 --> 32:03.924
Oh, boy.

32:04.007 --> 32:05.300
You'll get used to it.

32:05.384 --> 32:06.635
What?

32:06.677 --> 32:08.345
You pierced your navel?

32:08.428 --> 32:11.431
Yeah. I meant to talk
to you about that.

32:11.515 --> 32:14.935
- When did you do this?
- At Maddie's cousin's sweet 16.

32:15.018 --> 32:18.313
Well, when you get
your body back, it's grounded.

32:18.355 --> 32:19.815
And what are you doing?

32:19.898 --> 32:22.568
I don't know why you never wear
these. They're cute.

32:22.651 --> 32:26.488
Yeah, if you're selling Bibles.
And what did you do to my hair?

32:26.530 --> 32:29.032
I've been dying
to comb these rats out.

32:29.116 --> 32:30.534
Now you can see
your pretty face.

32:30.617 --> 32:32.119
And what is this?

32:32.202 --> 32:33.871
Oh, I fixed your jeans.

32:33.954 --> 32:36.707
My patients are not
going to pay $ 150 an hour

32:36.790 --> 32:39.001
to get therapy from a stripper.

32:39.042 --> 32:40.669
All right.
I'll drab up.

32:40.752 --> 32:41.920
I'll grunge down.

32:42.004 --> 32:43.213
Go.

32:44.798 --> 32:46.258
What's up?

32:55.058 --> 32:58.937
[Radio stations switching]

33:00.564 --> 33:02.191
Feet down.

33:03.150 --> 33:04.735
Harry, could you settle down?

33:04.818 --> 33:06.612
Bite me!

33:06.695 --> 33:08.822
Do you see what he
does behind your back?

33:08.906 --> 33:10.199
Anna!

33:10.240 --> 33:11.533
Mom.

33:11.617 --> 33:13.368
Excuse me.

33:14.453 --> 33:17.831
And while I'm apologizing,
let me just say to the whole car

33:17.915 --> 33:19.333
how truly sorry I am

33:19.416 --> 33:22.377
for being such an insane
control freak all the time.

33:22.419 --> 33:24.880
You're not controlling, Mom.

33:24.922 --> 33:27.007
I'm the one
who should be apologizing

33:27.090 --> 33:30.052
for my flagrant disregard for
anyone's feelings but my own.

33:30.093 --> 33:33.555
Well, at least you have
a great sense of style.

33:33.597 --> 33:35.641
- Not like me.
- Enough.

33:36.475 --> 33:37.392
Platinum, cool.

33:37.476 --> 33:40.103
Don't even think about it.

33:40.938 --> 33:43.398
Am I supposed to follow this?

33:43.482 --> 33:46.985
It's nothing, darling.

33:52.032 --> 33:53.534
One more day.

33:57.579 --> 34:01.250
Yeah, it's great we're
getting married, isn't it?

34:01.333 --> 34:02.751
Even though my husband died.

34:02.835 --> 34:04.586
How quickly I've been
able to get over it.

34:04.628 --> 34:08.507
Just pull up here.
Mom, out of the car.

34:13.679 --> 34:15.764
If you manage to alienate
Ryan in my body.

34:15.848 --> 34:16.764
I'll be nice.

34:16.849 --> 34:18.266
But don't kiss him.

34:18.308 --> 34:20.268
Oh, Mom, I just had breakfast.

34:20.310 --> 34:21.937
That's disgusting.

34:22.020 --> 34:23.397
Nice.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.983
Okay. Here is the number
for the cab company.

34:26.065 --> 34:28.235
I want you back here
at 11:45 sharp.

34:28.318 --> 34:28.985
All right.

34:29.069 --> 34:30.987
- Do you understand?
- All right!

34:31.071 --> 34:34.533
What is that tone?
Are you using a tone with me?

34:37.034 --> 34:39.121
Oh, my God.

34:39.204 --> 34:39.955
Can I go?

34:40.038 --> 34:41.873
Why?
What are you so anxious about?

34:41.956 --> 34:43.250
Hey, Anna.

34:44.710 --> 34:46.628
Do you know him?

34:48.463 --> 34:49.965
Kinda.
That's Jake.

34:50.047 --> 34:53.467
- No, no.
- You gotta give him a chance.

34:53.510 --> 34:56.179
That is the last thing
I'm going to give him.

34:56.263 --> 35:00.142
- You don't even know him.
- I know he's too old for you.

35:01.393 --> 35:03.228
My God, he's coming over.
Say hi.

35:03.312 --> 35:05.397
Say hi back,
or I break up with Ryan.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.941
- Hi, Jake.
- Hey.

35:10.152 --> 35:11.278
So.

35:11.361 --> 35:15.407
Oh, this is my mother,
Dr. Coleman.

35:16.783 --> 35:17.493
Hi.

35:17.576 --> 35:18.952
Hi.

35:23.707 --> 35:25.501
- It's a great bike.
- What?

35:25.584 --> 35:29.004
Not like I've ever been on it.
I'm not allowed.

35:30.130 --> 35:33.217
I mean I'm allowed
because I'm old.

35:35.552 --> 35:36.678
I gotta go.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.555
Bye.

35:38.639 --> 35:40.432
Walk with him.

35:46.730 --> 35:49.900
Harry, do you know who that is?

35:49.983 --> 35:51.985
Anna's got a boyfriend.

35:52.069 --> 35:55.030
K-l-S-S-l-N-G.

35:55.614 --> 35:58.742
Okay, where are we going next?
Harry's school?

36:00.494 --> 36:02.204
Oh, he can walk from here.

36:02.246 --> 36:04.289
It's 20 blocks!

36:04.373 --> 36:05.874
Fresh air will do you good.

36:05.958 --> 36:07.668
What about bullies?

36:07.751 --> 36:08.752
Run fast.

36:08.836 --> 36:12.422
Tess, look, really, it's
no trouble to drive him.

36:13.173 --> 36:14.132
Whatever.

36:22.599 --> 36:25.352
Hey, I've got The Hives for you.

36:25.435 --> 36:27.062
I beg your pardon?

36:27.145 --> 36:29.523
- The CD.
- Oh, yeah, that.

36:29.606 --> 36:31.233
They're coming
to town next week.

36:31.275 --> 36:33.402
- I was wondering if...
- That's a nice thought.

36:33.485 --> 36:36.029
I'm sure with a haircut
you'd look presentable.

36:36.113 --> 36:37.906
But I need to focus
on my schoolwork,

36:37.948 --> 36:40.492
and truth be told,
you're way too old for me.

36:40.576 --> 36:42.786
But thanks anyway, Jason.

36:44.621 --> 36:46.039
It's Jake.

36:50.002 --> 36:52.171
Hello.
Good morning.

36:52.254 --> 36:53.922
Good morning.
Hi.

36:53.964 --> 36:55.090
Hello.

36:57.009 --> 36:59.303
Stacey!
Hi, how are you?

36:59.386 --> 37:01.263
Oh, wonderful.

37:03.724 --> 37:06.310
Stacey, what are you doing?

37:10.355 --> 37:12.107
Run away.

37:13.483 --> 37:15.402
- Are you okay, Anna?
- God!

37:15.486 --> 37:18.322
I am appalled Stacey
would do something like that.

37:18.405 --> 37:19.406
Yeah, shocker.

37:19.490 --> 37:22.326
Oh, I am going
to be calling her mother.

37:22.409 --> 37:25.120
Forget about that.
We'll get her later.

37:25.162 --> 37:25.996
We saw you.

37:26.079 --> 37:27.706
- Saw me what?
- With Jake.

37:27.789 --> 37:30.042
- Give us the dirty details.
- Excuse me?

37:30.125 --> 37:31.168
Did you make a move?

37:31.251 --> 37:35.088
- Is that something I would do?
- It's something you should do.

37:35.172 --> 37:36.507
No, no, no.

37:36.590 --> 37:38.967
I don't believe
in physical contact

37:39.009 --> 37:41.720
with the opposite sex
at all, ever.

37:41.803 --> 37:42.721
Nothing.

37:42.804 --> 37:46.225
And you girls would do
well to follow my example.

37:58.529 --> 37:59.738
Well.

37:59.822 --> 38:02.241
- Whoa, whoa!
- What?

38:02.324 --> 38:03.867
Cold sore, cold sore.

38:03.951 --> 38:05.953
- Where?
- I feel it coming on there.

38:06.036 --> 38:07.496
- Big oozer.
- I don't care.

38:07.538 --> 38:09.790
I'm thinking of you, really.

38:09.873 --> 38:11.083
You.

38:11.166 --> 38:13.877
Okay. Okay.

38:13.961 --> 38:16.338
Good thing, I guess.

38:16.421 --> 38:19.758
You need a ride home, or are you
gonna pick up the Volvo?

38:19.842 --> 38:24.179
Oh, I will most definitely
be picking up the Volvo.

39:18.150 --> 39:20.777
Ow!

39:33.165 --> 39:34.917
Hey. How's it going?

39:34.958 --> 39:37.794
- Uh! What?

40:01.026 --> 40:02.569
Dr. Coleman's office.

40:02.653 --> 40:04.363
Hi.
This is Dr. Dunn's office.

40:04.446 --> 40:06.949
I am calling to confirm
your root canal appointment.

40:07.032 --> 40:07.950
Root canal?

40:07.991 --> 40:10.118
That's not fair!
They're not my teeth.

40:10.202 --> 40:12.329
Okay, I'm not sure...

40:12.412 --> 40:14.957
No.
No, I'm cutting the dentist.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.459
- You mean you're canceling?
- Yeah, cancel.

40:17.543 --> 40:20.504
Like I'm going to take
that bullet. Please!

40:24.508 --> 40:25.801
Evan.

40:25.884 --> 40:28.971
No. Boris.

40:29.054 --> 40:30.180
Line 27.

40:30.848 --> 40:32.307
- Thanks.
- There you go.

40:35.310 --> 40:38.522
Whoa!
She's blind!

40:38.605 --> 40:40.983
Oh, this sucks.

40:41.024 --> 40:42.025
Wanna get that?

40:42.109 --> 40:45.737
No way. I'm not answering
that thing again.

40:45.821 --> 40:46.738
Good to see you.

40:46.822 --> 40:48.073
Okay.

40:51.952 --> 40:53.412
You're here.

40:53.495 --> 40:57.457
Oh.
Yeah, I'm here, and you're here.

40:57.541 --> 40:59.001
You look fantastic.

40:59.042 --> 41:00.669
Why?
Are you canceling the session?

41:00.752 --> 41:01.670
No, Kevin.

41:01.712 --> 41:02.546
Evan!

41:02.629 --> 41:04.840
Evan. Evan.

41:04.923 --> 41:07.718
So, shall we go in here
and do it?

41:07.801 --> 41:10.512
Are you gonna get that?

41:10.554 --> 41:11.930
No.

41:12.014 --> 41:14.516
Oh, so you
don't answer your phone.

41:14.600 --> 41:17.477
I told you I wouldn't be able
to call you on your honeymoon,

41:17.561 --> 41:19.021
but you lied to me.

41:19.104 --> 41:20.522
You're a liar!

41:20.606 --> 41:21.648
I'll get it.

41:22.733 --> 41:23.734
Yo.

41:25.235 --> 41:26.361
What?

41:27.112 --> 41:29.823
$ 10,000? For what?

41:29.907 --> 41:32.117
Halibut!
Ew!

41:32.201 --> 41:34.536
What kind of caterer are you?

41:34.620 --> 41:36.872
It's disgusting.

41:36.955 --> 41:39.500
Well, I'm not gonna pay for it.

41:39.583 --> 41:42.878
Okay, fine. Don't show up.
See if I care.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.255
Yeah, I'm canceling.

41:45.339 --> 41:48.091
Yeah, well, same to you, dude.

41:48.800 --> 41:49.718
So, Ethan.

41:49.801 --> 41:50.719
Evan!

41:50.802 --> 41:53.138
Evan.
I knew that.

42:00.896 --> 42:04.358
Bates. I've seen him before.
Where have I seen him before?

42:04.441 --> 42:07.402
Like, every day
in this torture chamber.

42:07.444 --> 42:09.279
So, did you talk to your mom?

42:09.363 --> 42:14.243
Today is a lovely day
for a pop quiz.

42:15.994 --> 42:19.456
All of you should have finished
reading "Hamlet" by now.

42:19.540 --> 42:22.125
I'm going to ask each
one of you one question,

42:22.209 --> 42:25.212
and you will be graded
according to your answer.

42:25.295 --> 42:29.174
Oh, thank God it's "Hamlet."
I was in that play in high...

42:29.883 --> 42:31.969
I just know the play.

42:32.052 --> 42:33.303
Like that'll help you.

42:33.387 --> 42:37.641
Mr. Waters, describe
the character of Hamlet.

42:42.312 --> 42:43.772
Hamlet.

42:43.856 --> 42:47.317
He's, uh...
he's one of the big characters.

42:47.359 --> 42:48.944
I mean, he's Hamlet.

42:50.529 --> 42:56.201
He's just bopping around,
doesn't know which way's up.

42:57.786 --> 43:01.290
I don't think
the guy's got a clue.

43:01.373 --> 43:05.586
You mean to say
that he is a man...

43:05.669 --> 43:06.336
Yeah.

43:06.420 --> 43:10.757
Who couldn't make up his...

43:10.841 --> 43:13.010
- mind.
- Mind.

43:13.093 --> 43:14.511
Exactly.

43:14.595 --> 43:15.179
Very good.

43:15.262 --> 43:16.513
All right.

43:16.597 --> 43:18.515
- "B."
- Yeah.

43:21.268 --> 43:22.477
Ms. Coleman.

43:22.561 --> 43:23.645
Yes, Mr. Bates?

43:23.729 --> 43:27.316
What are the central
conflicts in "Hamlet"?

43:27.357 --> 43:29.401
Well, political, of course,

43:29.485 --> 43:31.653
because Claudius usurped
his father's throne.

43:31.695 --> 43:34.656
Oedipal, because of the
undercurrents with his mother.

43:34.698 --> 43:36.992
Then there is the timeless
question of insanity.

43:37.075 --> 43:42.706
Is he really seeing his father's
ghost, or is he simply mad?

43:42.789 --> 43:47.794
That is seriously overreaching.

43:47.878 --> 43:48.754
"F."

43:48.837 --> 43:50.589
- "F"?
- "F."

43:50.672 --> 43:53.800
Mr. Franelli, who is Fortinbras?

43:53.884 --> 43:55.844
I started reading your new book,

43:55.928 --> 44:00.182
and it just makes me feel
really depressed.

44:02.434 --> 44:04.686
And how do you feel about that?

44:06.021 --> 44:07.356
Depressed.

44:07.397 --> 44:11.026
[Mumbling incoherently]

44:18.742 --> 44:21.703
And how do you feel about that?

44:26.917 --> 44:29.920
She and her best friend
aren't speaking, Doctor.

44:30.003 --> 44:33.507
And in her diary,
she keeps mentioning this boy.

44:33.590 --> 44:35.300
How do you feel about that?

44:35.384 --> 44:36.343
Well, I'm worried.

44:36.426 --> 44:38.220
You read her diaries?

44:38.262 --> 44:40.389
Oh, that's gross!

44:40.472 --> 44:42.891
That's bad.
"Bad Mom" award.

44:42.933 --> 44:46.937
But I'm concerned, Doctor,
that she and this boy might be,

44:47.020 --> 44:48.397
I mean, you know.

44:48.480 --> 44:50.315
Stop! Stop!

44:50.399 --> 44:52.901
Nothing is going on
between her and this guy.

44:52.985 --> 44:55.779
If there was, she wouldn't be
writing about it.

44:55.863 --> 44:57.447
She'd be out there doing it.

44:57.573 --> 44:59.825
Her best friend
probably isn't talking to her

44:59.867 --> 45:01.869
because she probably
likes this guy, too.

45:01.952 --> 45:04.329
And he probably flirted
with her a little,

45:04.413 --> 45:05.622
but he secretly
likes your daughter.

45:05.706 --> 45:08.208
He hasn't made his move yet
because that wouldn't be cool.

45:08.292 --> 45:11.920
So now her best friend is
acting like some psycho freak.

45:12.004 --> 45:13.130
Okay?

45:14.756 --> 45:16.592
That's very interesting.

45:16.633 --> 45:18.886
I never would have
thought about it that way.

45:18.969 --> 45:20.888
Cool.
Guess we're done.

45:28.395 --> 45:30.814
Mr. Bates, may I please
speak with you?

45:30.898 --> 45:34.318
I think that would be fairly
pointless, but go ahead.

45:34.401 --> 45:37.905
By what stretch
of the imagination...

45:37.988 --> 45:41.492
I mean, like, how could I,
like, get an "F"?

45:41.575 --> 45:42.951
What mistakes did I make?

45:43.035 --> 45:44.786
Grading is subjective.

45:44.870 --> 45:46.705
That was
a college-level analysis.

45:46.788 --> 45:50.125
And you're qualified
to make that assessment?

45:50.167 --> 45:51.376
I most certainly am.

45:51.460 --> 45:55.839
Well, in the words of Hamlet,
"What's done is done."

45:55.923 --> 45:59.426
That's "Macbeth,"
you know-nothing twit.

45:59.551 --> 46:01.720
Bates.
Elton Bates.

46:01.762 --> 46:03.263
Griffith High School.

46:03.347 --> 46:04.973
How do you know that?

46:05.015 --> 46:08.060
Well, you asked me,
I mean, my mom to the prom,

46:08.143 --> 46:09.895
but she turned you down.

46:09.978 --> 46:11.980
This is not
an appropriate subject.

46:12.064 --> 46:14.483
You're taking it out
on her daughter, aren't you?

46:14.525 --> 46:16.151
I don't know
what you're talking about.

46:16.235 --> 46:17.986
It was a high school dance.

46:18.028 --> 46:20.489
You've got to let it
go and move on, man.

46:20.531 --> 46:24.076
And if you don't, I'm sure the
school board would love to hear

46:24.159 --> 46:28.372
about your pathetic vendetta
against an innocent student.

46:28.455 --> 46:30.457
Oh, and by the way, Elton,

46:30.541 --> 46:34.628
she had a boyfriend,
and you were weird.

46:36.505 --> 46:40.008
That was amazing.
You totally destroyed him.

46:40.092 --> 46:42.845
I don't think Elton Bates
will be giving me much trouble.

46:42.928 --> 46:44.388
That's so weird about your mom.

46:44.471 --> 46:46.557
- Oh, yeah, what did she say?
- About what?

46:46.640 --> 46:49.643
- About the audition.
- Oh, right. She said no.

46:49.726 --> 46:51.270
What?

46:52.062 --> 46:53.897
Well, it is
her rehearsal dinner.

46:53.981 --> 46:56.733
Don't you think
that's rather important, too?

46:56.817 --> 46:58.193
And you told her?

46:58.235 --> 47:00.571
You told her this chance
would never come again?

47:00.654 --> 47:03.115
- She sympathizes.
- Don't give us this.

47:03.198 --> 47:05.075
She is totally
ruining our lives.

47:05.159 --> 47:06.493
You're the culprit.

47:06.577 --> 47:09.371
Yeah, your mom
has never cared about our music.

47:09.413 --> 47:10.414
Never cared?

47:10.497 --> 47:11.498
Never cared?

47:11.582 --> 47:13.625
Who do you think paid
for those guitar lessons?

47:13.709 --> 47:16.420
And did she ever hear
a "thank you"? No.

47:16.503 --> 47:18.046
Come on, you said it yourself.

47:18.130 --> 47:20.090
Your mom hasn't paid
attention to you

47:20.174 --> 47:22.342
since she started
dating that guy.

47:22.426 --> 47:23.343
That's not true.

47:23.427 --> 47:25.179
Well, you talk about it enough.

47:25.262 --> 47:26.221
I do?

47:26.305 --> 47:28.307
What is up with you today?

47:28.390 --> 47:31.226
You act like you don't even
care about this band.

47:31.268 --> 47:34.938
Look, girls... guys,
if it were any other night.

47:35.022 --> 47:37.441
Whatever, Anna.

47:40.986 --> 47:42.362
God.

47:44.948 --> 47:47.117
[Tires squealing in distance]

47:47.201 --> 47:49.578
[Car horns honking,
alarm sounding]

47:54.875 --> 47:56.710
[Rock music blaring]

48:03.342 --> 48:05.093
- You picked up my car!
- Yeah.

48:05.177 --> 48:07.346
Get out of the car.
I'm driving.

48:07.429 --> 48:09.598
Oh, my God.
What have you done to me?

48:09.640 --> 48:10.849
Do you like it?

48:10.933 --> 48:13.769
Get out of the car right now!

48:13.852 --> 48:15.103
Do you have your permit?

48:15.187 --> 48:16.980
No.

48:22.444 --> 48:24.488
My hair.
It's gone!

48:24.571 --> 48:26.073
What have you done to my ear?

48:26.156 --> 48:27.616
Mom, it's an earring!

48:27.658 --> 48:29.159
Take it out right now!

48:29.243 --> 48:30.744
No.
It looks cool.

48:30.828 --> 48:31.954
Don't start with me.

48:31.995 --> 48:34.248
Those clothes
are going back tomorrow!

48:34.331 --> 48:36.333
Why? Everyone likes them.
You look great.

48:36.416 --> 48:38.418
I look like Stevie Nicks.

48:38.502 --> 48:40.212
Who's he?

48:40.295 --> 48:42.965
- What are you doing with this?
- I'm eating.

48:43.006 --> 48:44.466
You cannot eat fast food.

48:44.508 --> 48:45.092
Why not?

48:45.175 --> 48:47.010
Because it will
go down your throat

48:47.094 --> 48:49.763
and drop instantly to my thighs.

48:49.847 --> 48:51.473
- Oh, come on.
- Watch the road.

48:53.809 --> 48:56.854
Oh, this food may make
you blow up like a balloon,

48:56.937 --> 48:59.231
but it will do nothing
whatsoever to me.

48:59.314 --> 49:01.358
Oh, Mom!

49:03.527 --> 49:05.028
Oh, God, this is good.

49:05.112 --> 49:06.613
Mom, that's not fair.

49:06.697 --> 49:09.324
My first french fry
in eight years.

49:09.408 --> 49:12.202
I can hear
the "Hallelujah Chorus."

49:13.871 --> 49:15.664
Road!

49:20.752 --> 49:24.256
Oh, hi, hi.
You back so soon.

49:24.339 --> 49:26.425
Sexy new look for you,
Mrs. Coleman.

49:26.508 --> 49:27.426
You look hot.

49:27.509 --> 49:29.261
- Two for lunch?
- No, Pei-Pei.

49:29.344 --> 49:30.637
We'd like to speak
to you about something

49:30.721 --> 49:32.681
we think happened
to us at your restaurant.

49:32.723 --> 49:35.058
- Something that sucks.
- Let me handle this.

49:35.142 --> 49:36.435
Okay.

49:36.518 --> 49:40.814
When we woke up this morning,
we weren't ourselves.

49:40.898 --> 49:42.191
Yeah.

49:42.232 --> 49:45.027
Oh. Mama!

49:49.615 --> 49:52.826
Hey, hey!
You come back here.

49:56.914 --> 49:58.707
Hello, hello.

49:58.790 --> 50:00.334
Did you give them
the fortune cookie?

50:09.051 --> 50:09.968
What did she say?

50:10.052 --> 50:11.887
Oh.
She's crazy.

50:23.982 --> 50:25.567
Well?

50:25.651 --> 50:28.320
She don't know what
you're talking about.

50:28.403 --> 50:30.489
Okay, let's have lunch.
Let's eat.

50:30.572 --> 50:32.324
You know exactly
what we're talking about.

50:32.407 --> 50:33.575
Let's hit her.

50:33.617 --> 50:36.203
Okay, okay.

50:37.621 --> 50:40.040
I cannot fix it.
Only you can fix it.

50:40.123 --> 50:42.918
When the fortune come true,
then you go back.

50:42.960 --> 50:43.961
What fortune?

50:44.002 --> 50:46.463
From the fortune cookie.

50:46.547 --> 50:48.799
You find the answer
in each other.

50:48.882 --> 50:51.885
When the fortune come true,
then you go back, okay?

50:51.969 --> 50:53.762
No big deal.

50:54.346 --> 50:56.640
You mean, we're stuck
in this suck-fest?

50:56.723 --> 50:58.934
You're not going to do anything?

50:58.976 --> 51:00.519
How about 10% off catering?

51:00.602 --> 51:03.063
No, Pei-Pei, we have a caterer.

51:03.147 --> 51:06.942
Actually, Mom, there's something
I forgot to tell you.

51:07.025 --> 51:11.530
Okay, good idea, how about I do?

51:13.031 --> 51:15.742
- What did that fortune say?
- Like I remember?

51:15.826 --> 51:18.620
- I don't remember, either.
- Oh, I hate this!

51:18.704 --> 51:20.956
I don't wanna get married at 15!

51:21.039 --> 51:22.791
It's not even legal!

51:22.833 --> 51:25.502
I want my room back.
I want my friends.

51:25.586 --> 51:27.963
I want to eat whatever
I want when I want.

51:28.005 --> 51:29.214
Mommy.

51:29.298 --> 51:31.967
I know, sweetie.
It's a hard day.

51:32.009 --> 51:33.302
We'll get through it.

51:33.385 --> 51:35.095
Breathe.
Deep breath.

51:35.179 --> 51:37.139
We'll go home
and find the fortune.

51:37.222 --> 51:39.474
[Cellphone ringing,
beeping]

51:39.558 --> 51:41.518
- Make it stop!
- Oh, my organizer.

51:41.602 --> 51:43.645
It's been going off all day.

51:46.356 --> 51:47.941
Parent-teacher conference!

51:48.025 --> 51:49.151
I completely forgot!

51:49.234 --> 51:51.111
You have to be at Harry's
school in 15 minutes.

51:51.195 --> 51:52.196
No!
I hate teachers!

51:52.279 --> 51:54.531
You have to go.
I'll go to your school.

51:54.615 --> 51:57.743
I'll take your exam,
and everything will be okay.

51:57.826 --> 51:59.578
Okay, let's go.

52:06.418 --> 52:07.503
Mom?

52:07.586 --> 52:09.338
Yeah. Whatever.

52:11.048 --> 52:12.758
Mrs. Coleman.

52:14.009 --> 52:16.470
All right, let's do this thing.

52:17.137 --> 52:18.388
Okay.

52:18.472 --> 52:21.600
Well, what can I say
about Harry?

52:21.683 --> 52:23.560
He is a sweet boy.

52:23.644 --> 52:27.481
But he's having a little
trouble with bullies.

52:27.564 --> 52:29.024
So?

52:29.107 --> 52:31.985
That's character-building.
Kid needs to toughen up.

52:32.069 --> 52:34.530
He's kind of a wimp.

52:34.571 --> 52:36.532
So, that's it?
I can go?

52:36.573 --> 52:39.159
No, not exactly.

52:39.243 --> 52:40.661
Harry's very bright,

52:40.744 --> 52:43.247
but he's having a
problem applying himself,

52:43.330 --> 52:44.581
particularly in Math.

52:44.665 --> 52:45.874
So, hold him back.

52:45.916 --> 52:47.459
I mean, he's short.

52:47.543 --> 52:49.753
He'll fit in,
you know what I mean?

52:51.505 --> 52:54.007
Well, you know,
he's very good in English.

52:54.091 --> 52:57.135
I had the class write an essay
on who they admire most,

52:57.219 --> 53:01.390
and he wrote a wonderful
paper about your daughter.

53:21.660 --> 53:23.704
So, what'd she say?

53:23.787 --> 53:26.123
She showed me the paper
you wrote about Anna.

53:26.206 --> 53:28.083
- You saw that?
- Mm-hmm.

53:28.125 --> 53:30.252
Well, don't tell her I like her.

53:30.335 --> 53:31.336
Well, why not?

53:31.420 --> 53:34.506
Because we have
too much fun fighting.

53:38.594 --> 53:42.973
You know, kid, you are way more
twisted than I thought.

53:47.186 --> 53:48.520
Good try!

53:48.604 --> 53:49.980
- Oh, man!
- Loser!

53:52.024 --> 53:53.650
Good luck flunking.

53:54.485 --> 53:57.779
Stacey, I want to talk to you.
Come here.

53:59.031 --> 54:00.782
Why this falling out?

54:00.824 --> 54:03.118
We were best friends
in sixth grade.

54:03.160 --> 54:05.204
I know I got
involved with my music,

54:05.287 --> 54:07.206
and you became involved
with your cheerleading,

54:07.289 --> 54:09.500
but why does this
have to be World War III?

54:09.583 --> 54:10.459
All those years

54:10.542 --> 54:13.295
of trick-or-treating
and sleepovers.

54:13.378 --> 54:16.131
Don't you remember any of it?
I know I do.

54:16.173 --> 54:19.134
I mean, how do you
feel about that?

54:19.176 --> 54:22.971
All right, let's all
take our seats for the test.

54:24.014 --> 54:26.141
Sit with me?

54:26.183 --> 54:28.894
Communication.
That's all it takes.

54:30.896 --> 54:33.148
Hey, there you are.

54:33.232 --> 54:34.483
Ooh! You again.

54:34.525 --> 54:36.360
Look at you.

54:36.443 --> 54:38.946
Love the hair.

54:39.029 --> 54:41.532
Got a surprise.
You're gonna be happy with me.

54:41.615 --> 54:42.908
I seriously doubt that.

54:42.991 --> 54:44.868
Great dress. Sexy.

54:44.952 --> 54:46.203
Oozing sore!

54:46.286 --> 54:47.663
I don't see anything.

54:49.039 --> 54:50.165
Makeup! Great stuff!

54:50.249 --> 54:53.460
Hey, take it easy, stud.
Save it for the honeymoon.

54:53.544 --> 54:56.129
You know what?
We have to go anyway.

54:56.213 --> 54:58.841
Oh, no, I have to get
that fortune thingy.

54:58.882 --> 55:00.759
No time.
I've got my sweater on.

55:00.843 --> 55:02.386
No, no.
I have to...

55:02.469 --> 55:04.972
We have to leave.
We'll spoil the surprise.

55:05.055 --> 55:05.138
- Watch your step.
- Okay.

55:05.138 --> 55:06.348
- Watch your step.
- Okay.

55:06.431 --> 55:07.850
- Watch your step.
- Okay!

55:07.891 --> 55:10.686
- Still got your eyes closed?
- Yeah.

55:10.769 --> 55:13.438
All right, okay, relax.
Open them.

55:14.982 --> 55:16.692
You're on
"The Dottie Robertson Show."

55:16.775 --> 55:19.319
They had
a last-second cancellation.

55:19.403 --> 55:20.988
I got you on.

55:21.071 --> 55:22.406
To talk about that book?

55:22.489 --> 55:23.782
Break a leg.

55:23.866 --> 55:25.367
I didn't want to say anything.

55:25.450 --> 55:26.910
We're ready for you now.

55:26.994 --> 55:28.704
I know you get nervous,
but you're gonna be great.

55:28.745 --> 55:30.539
I'm gonna barf!

55:30.622 --> 55:31.957
Go get 'em!

55:32.666 --> 55:35.419
- Watch your step. This way.
- I'm sorry.

55:35.502 --> 55:37.838
- I'm not that person.
- Right there.

55:37.921 --> 55:39.756
There you go.
Oh, sorry.

55:39.840 --> 55:43.719
Now, makeup's gonna
come to you, sweetie, okay?

55:43.760 --> 55:44.761
What is this thing?

55:44.803 --> 55:47.514
"Through the Looking Glass.
Senescence."

55:47.598 --> 55:50.851
Se-nes-cence?
Seeny-sincey?

55:50.934 --> 55:52.561
What?

55:55.189 --> 55:57.274
"The sum of
the areas of the shaded regions

55:57.357 --> 56:00.277
in terms of 'D' is equal to
A, 'D' squared times the sum

56:00.360 --> 56:03.280
of pi divided by four minus
'D' divided by two.

56:03.363 --> 56:06.033
B, 'D' squared
times the sum of pi cubed

56:06.116 --> 56:07.701
divided by 'D' minus two."

56:07.784 --> 56:10.662
Now, what is pi again?
Three-point-something?

56:10.746 --> 56:13.248
Oh, this is ridiculous.
I've never used pi.

56:13.332 --> 56:16.835
Anna's never gonna use pi!
Why is it called pi anyway?

56:16.919 --> 56:18.545
Okay, focus.

56:18.629 --> 56:21.965
Or "C, 'D' cubed minus
the sum of pi squared.

56:22.049 --> 56:23.342
Psst!

56:28.514 --> 56:31.433
Miss Brown,
she's copying my test!

56:58.502 --> 57:01.129
- Hey, cheater.
- I did not cheat.

57:01.213 --> 57:03.215
That Stacey Hinkhouse
is conniving.

57:03.298 --> 57:04.591
It's your business.

57:04.675 --> 57:08.011
I did not cheat.
Don't you smirk at me.

57:08.095 --> 57:09.012
If you're so perfect,

57:09.096 --> 57:10.848
why are you
in detention all the time?

57:10.931 --> 57:14.101
I'm not in detention.
I work here.

57:16.520 --> 57:19.857
What would you say if I told you
I could help finish your test?

57:20.858 --> 57:21.984
Really?

57:22.818 --> 57:24.236
Yeah.

57:24.319 --> 57:27.573
You know, my publisher doesn't
think anybody's gonna know

57:27.656 --> 57:30.117
what the word
"senescence" means.

57:30.200 --> 57:31.410
Do you know what it means?

57:31.493 --> 57:33.120
No.
Please do sit still.

57:33.203 --> 57:34.663
Okay.

57:37.457 --> 57:40.919
All right, they keep
the tests in the file room.

57:41.003 --> 57:43.088
We're going through here?

57:43.172 --> 57:47.050
They're so burned out
they won't notice. Trust me.

58:12.743 --> 58:15.662
All right, all right, all right.
Coleman.

58:17.623 --> 58:18.665
Anna Coleman.

58:18.749 --> 58:20.918
Oh, my gosh, thank you.

58:21.919 --> 58:24.087
Now hurry up
and finish your test.

58:24.171 --> 58:27.174
You really are something, Jake.

58:27.257 --> 58:28.759
I'll watch the door.

58:29.885 --> 58:31.720
Back from commercial in 10.

58:31.803 --> 58:35.307
Loved your book.
I actually read this one.

58:36.141 --> 58:37.684
That makes one of us.

58:38.602 --> 58:42.397
Ready and three, two.

58:43.440 --> 58:44.441
Hi. Welcome back.

58:44.525 --> 58:46.360
We're here with
Dr. Tess Coleman,

58:46.443 --> 58:48.612
author of
"Through the Looking Glass,

58:48.695 --> 58:50.656
Senescence in Retrograde."

58:50.739 --> 58:53.784
So, Doctor, tell us
about your new book.

58:57.955 --> 58:59.248
Well.

59:00.958 --> 59:02.668
I wrote it.

59:03.544 --> 59:05.337
Yes, you did.

59:05.420 --> 59:08.674
But tell us,
what got you interested

59:08.757 --> 59:12.845
in the physical and
intellectual exhaustion

59:12.928 --> 59:14.680
that seems to overcome
those of us

59:14.763 --> 59:18.141
who are, let's say,
no longer 20.

59:19.893 --> 59:22.688
Senescence, like senile!

59:22.771 --> 59:24.106
Old people!

59:24.189 --> 59:25.732
Got it!
Got it!

59:26.483 --> 59:30.612
And let's face it,
we are tired much of the time.

59:30.696 --> 59:33.073
That's why I've been craving
caffeine all day.

59:33.157 --> 59:35.117
I thought I was dying.

01:00:07.399 --> 01:00:10.569
But you still haven't answered
the fundamental question.

01:00:10.652 --> 01:00:14.323
Why are we so tired?

01:00:14.364 --> 01:00:17.659
Well, of course we're tired

01:00:17.701 --> 01:00:22.164
because of our demanding
and hectic...

01:00:25.042 --> 01:00:28.712
Do you want to know why adults
are so tired all the time?

01:00:28.795 --> 01:00:30.672
Because they spend
their time obsessing

01:00:30.714 --> 01:00:34.176
about these stupid, lame things
they don't really have to do.

01:00:34.218 --> 01:00:35.344
Like cooking.

01:00:35.427 --> 01:00:37.679
I mean, have you never
heard of takeout?

01:00:37.721 --> 01:00:39.932
And cleaning?

01:00:40.015 --> 01:00:41.892
Let's don't and say we did!

01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:45.771
And quality time with your kids?
You know what?

01:00:45.854 --> 01:00:47.523
Quit bugging 'em!

01:00:47.606 --> 01:00:49.733
Leave 'em alone!
They like it!

01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:56.824
I don't remember reading
any of this in your book.

01:00:56.907 --> 01:01:01.411
Hello? It's called
reading between the lines!

01:01:01.495 --> 01:01:02.704
Oh, my God.

01:01:02.788 --> 01:01:04.289
What?

01:01:04.373 --> 01:01:05.874
That's my mom.

01:01:05.958 --> 01:01:07.876
Try listening
to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs,

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.503
The Vines, The Breeders.

01:01:09.586 --> 01:01:11.922
And if you're excited
about something,

01:01:12.005 --> 01:01:14.508
why do you have to hold
it in all the time?

01:01:14.591 --> 01:01:16.593
You know, just scream about it!

01:01:16.635 --> 01:01:18.303
Okay, do this with me.

01:01:18.387 --> 01:01:20.806
Let's just say this
cute guy asks you out.

01:01:20.889 --> 01:01:24.518
What are you gonna do?
Whoo!

01:01:24.601 --> 01:01:25.602
Whoo!

01:01:25.686 --> 01:01:27.437
Whoo!

01:01:27.521 --> 01:01:28.814
That was pathetic!

01:01:28.897 --> 01:01:31.942
You keep all that bottled up,
no wonder you're getting old!

01:01:32.025 --> 01:01:33.569
I'm serious!
This guy's hot!

01:01:33.652 --> 01:01:35.404
What are you gonna do?

01:01:35.487 --> 01:01:37.739
God, your mom's cool.

01:01:37.781 --> 01:01:39.366
I can't hear you!

01:01:39.449 --> 01:01:42.119
Whoo!

01:01:42.202 --> 01:01:44.705
Oh, she is dead.
Worse than dead.

01:01:44.788 --> 01:01:45.914
She will spend the next year

01:01:45.998 --> 01:01:49.042
in a phoneless,
dateless, Amish existence.

01:01:49.126 --> 01:01:50.335
I've gotta get home.

01:01:50.419 --> 01:01:52.629
I've gotta get home.

01:02:09.146 --> 01:02:11.315
Listen, I need you
to give me a ride.

01:02:11.398 --> 01:02:13.400
I thought your mom
didn't want you on a bike.

01:02:13.484 --> 01:02:15.277
You're a little
too virtuous, kid.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.113
You know what?
I'm late for my second job.

01:02:18.155 --> 01:02:20.115
Just give me the ride.

01:02:20.157 --> 01:02:22.534
I know my mother
will understand.

01:02:22.618 --> 01:02:24.328
I'm gonna be honest with you.

01:02:24.411 --> 01:02:28.248
You seem really different than
the person I thought you were.

01:02:28.332 --> 01:02:30.334
I saw what you
did to Stacey's test.

01:02:30.417 --> 01:02:32.628
I think you're right.

01:02:32.711 --> 01:02:34.087
You're too young for me.

01:02:34.171 --> 01:02:36.131
But I don't know why I did that.

01:02:36.215 --> 01:02:38.217
It's really not like me.
Honestly.

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:39.760
Good luck, Anna.

01:02:41.762 --> 01:02:44.181
Come on!
They'll let her retake the test!

01:02:44.264 --> 01:02:45.974
Ohh!

01:02:46.016 --> 01:02:48.560
That's the first time Tessie's
work hasn't put me to sleep.

01:02:48.644 --> 01:02:51.688
I might even read
one of those books.

01:02:51.772 --> 01:02:54.650
Hey, is Dr. Coleman
coming out soon?

01:02:54.733 --> 01:02:58.237
Dottie had her escorted from
the building 10 minutes ago.

01:02:58.362 --> 01:03:00.280
But she rocks, doesn't she?

01:03:00.322 --> 01:03:03.826
Look, she signed my butt!

01:03:03.909 --> 01:03:05.702
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:15.754
Can I have
a quad-choc-caramel latte?

01:03:18.841 --> 01:03:20.050
Mrs. Coleman?

01:03:21.218 --> 01:03:24.012
Jake!
What are you doing here?

01:03:24.054 --> 01:03:27.641
I work here.
Hey, I caught the show.

01:03:27.724 --> 01:03:29.935
Man, you sure were great.

01:03:30.018 --> 01:03:31.687
Thanks.

01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:33.021
How was Anna today?

01:03:33.063 --> 01:03:35.524
I mean, was she nice to you?

01:03:35.566 --> 01:03:37.568
She was stressing a little,

01:03:37.609 --> 01:03:39.987
but you know how it is
with school.

01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:44.366
Okay, 'cause if she wasn't,
I'd have to punish her.

01:03:45.242 --> 01:03:46.577
You punish her?

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:49.663
No mom who listens to The Vines
would punish anybody.

01:03:49.746 --> 01:03:52.040
- You like The Vines?
- I got the bootlegs!

01:03:52.124 --> 01:03:53.667
Shut up!

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.834
Whoo! Whoo!

01:03:53.834 --> 01:03:56.420
Whoo! Whoo!

01:03:56.503 --> 01:03:58.714
Oh, Anna Banana, it's you.

01:03:58.797 --> 01:04:02.217
- Where's Mom?
- She ditched us at the studio.

01:04:02.301 --> 01:04:05.220
Harry, get down from
the table this instant!

01:04:05.304 --> 01:04:07.890
I'm imitating Mom.
You should've seen her today!

01:04:07.973 --> 01:04:09.475
She was so cool!

01:04:09.558 --> 01:04:13.395
Whoo! Whoo!

01:04:17.691 --> 01:04:19.693
Ramones?

01:04:19.776 --> 01:04:21.320
Love.

01:04:22.821 --> 01:04:24.823
White Stripes?

01:04:24.907 --> 01:04:25.949
Can't stand 'em.

01:04:26.033 --> 01:04:28.577
I know! Me neither.
I mean, get a bass player.

01:04:31.997 --> 01:04:33.040
I love this song.

01:04:33.081 --> 01:04:35.751
Am I so lame that I would
love "Baby, One More Time"?

01:04:35.792 --> 01:04:39.421
No, this cover's a classic.

01:05:06.782 --> 01:05:08.617
I gotta go.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.118
What?
Don't go.

01:05:10.202 --> 01:05:13.497
No, no.
I have a wedding rehearsal.

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:14.623
Okay, whose?

01:05:14.706 --> 01:05:16.124
Mine.

01:05:17.584 --> 01:05:18.710
Are you serious?

01:05:18.794 --> 01:05:20.754
I wish I wasn't.

01:05:24.174 --> 01:05:26.760
You're not really
getting married, are you?

01:05:26.844 --> 01:05:29.429
This was so fun, and I'm
gonna remember it forever.

01:05:29.513 --> 01:05:31.807
- Okay, but you can't...
- Jake...

01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:33.767
Look, I don't know
what's going on.

01:05:33.809 --> 01:05:37.437
I don't know what
this whole thing is.

01:05:37.521 --> 01:05:40.149
I feel like I know you.

01:05:40.232 --> 01:05:42.484
I have to go.
Really, I just...

01:05:42.526 --> 01:05:45.529
Please.
Just please.

01:05:46.613 --> 01:05:48.615
Let me at least
give you a ride.

01:05:50.159 --> 01:05:51.243
Okay.

01:06:14.099 --> 01:06:17.144
Here you are,
you little monster.

01:06:17.227 --> 01:06:18.687
Okay.

01:06:37.581 --> 01:06:38.540
Tess!

01:06:40.042 --> 01:06:40.501
Tess!

01:06:43.253 --> 01:06:44.838
Tess!

01:07:00.604 --> 01:07:01.939
Where have you been?

01:07:02.022 --> 01:07:04.399
You needed to be dressed
a half hour ago!

01:07:04.441 --> 01:07:06.026
You tell me where you've
been, young lady!

01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:07.569
Young lady?

01:07:09.613 --> 01:07:11.824
Role-playing!
Her idea.

01:07:11.907 --> 01:07:15.452
New therapeutic technique.
Switching points of view.

01:07:16.078 --> 01:07:18.622
If I switch with Harry,
do I have to wear a thong?

01:07:18.705 --> 01:07:20.791
[Mockingly]
Earthquake! Save me!

01:07:20.874 --> 01:07:23.085
Get back here, you little.

01:07:23.168 --> 01:07:25.003
Where do I even begin?

01:07:25.087 --> 01:07:27.673
Could it be your
career-killing TV appearance,

01:07:27.756 --> 01:07:30.467
your nonstop partying
with my car and wallet,

01:07:30.551 --> 01:07:33.929
or, perhaps, my body's
makeover from hell?

01:07:33.971 --> 01:07:36.640
Are you listening
to a word I'm saying?

01:07:36.723 --> 01:07:37.724
Yes.

01:07:37.808 --> 01:07:40.144
And get that cheap stud
out of my ear.

01:07:40.227 --> 01:07:42.354
Mom, he is so awesome.

01:07:42.437 --> 01:07:44.565
- Who?
- Jake.

01:07:44.606 --> 01:07:47.276
Please, Mommy, can I
go out with him? Please?

01:07:47.359 --> 01:07:49.820
Not in Ryan's
fiancée's body, you can't.

01:07:49.903 --> 01:07:52.823
What am I supposed to
do in Ryan's fiancée's body?

01:07:52.906 --> 01:07:54.908
Go to this thing tonight?
Be you?

01:07:54.992 --> 01:07:57.327
That's today.
What about tomorrow, Mom?

01:07:57.411 --> 01:07:59.997
I really don't want
to get married.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.748
I don't think you're thrilled

01:08:01.832 --> 01:08:04.126
about me getting married
either, Anna.

01:08:05.794 --> 01:08:07.129
Why?

01:08:07.171 --> 01:08:09.631
Why can't we talk about this?

01:08:09.673 --> 01:08:11.800
What is it about
Ryan you don't like?

01:08:11.884 --> 01:08:13.343
He's fine.

01:08:14.261 --> 01:08:16.430
But he's not your father.

01:08:16.471 --> 01:08:19.099
Mom, look, I don't wanna talk
about this now.

01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:22.769
Time's running out to talk
about it. Please, tell me.

01:08:22.853 --> 01:08:25.522
Mom, do what you want.

01:08:25.606 --> 01:08:27.983
Marry the dude.
Just don't make me do it.

01:08:28.066 --> 01:08:29.568
Tess?

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:33.404
[Mockingly]
Privacy's a privilege, Anna.

01:08:33.488 --> 01:08:34.698
Tess?

01:08:34.781 --> 01:08:36.325
Go.

01:08:36.408 --> 01:08:37.701
Yo, sup?

01:08:39.661 --> 01:08:42.538
I'm not really
a prying kind of guy,

01:08:42.622 --> 01:08:45.000
but I was wondering
what you were doing

01:08:45.082 --> 01:08:46.542
on the eve of our wedding

01:08:46.627 --> 01:08:50.005
straddling some guy on the
back of a big, black Harley.

01:08:50.087 --> 01:08:52.341
Hello?
It was a Ducati.

01:08:52.424 --> 01:08:54.843
Is there something
you'd like to tell me?

01:08:54.926 --> 01:08:57.011
Some fantasy you're trying
to get out of your system?

01:08:57.095 --> 01:08:59.598
Because I'd like
to know about it now.

01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:02.518
I just needed a ride.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:05.145
I didn't really
even know the guy.

01:09:05.187 --> 01:09:07.523
I didn't know what...

01:09:07.564 --> 01:09:10.399
He's a friend of mine, Ryan.

01:09:10.484 --> 01:09:12.027
He likes me.

01:09:12.109 --> 01:09:15.613
And my mom wouldn't
let me go out with him,

01:09:15.697 --> 01:09:21.161
so I just had to beg her
to check him out for me.

01:09:21.245 --> 01:09:22.371
And she did.

01:09:22.453 --> 01:09:24.997
And she actually came to find

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.960
that he's a very
together young man.

01:09:28.042 --> 01:09:31.380
And she approves.

01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:34.466
Really?

01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:35.509
Really.

01:09:35.551 --> 01:09:37.886
Snap!

01:09:40.221 --> 01:09:41.223
Uh-huh.

01:09:41.305 --> 01:09:44.309
So, let's do this thingy!

01:09:44.393 --> 01:09:47.729
- You mean our wedding rehearsal?
- Yeah, whatever.

01:10:14.715 --> 01:10:16.425
Excuse me.

01:10:24.558 --> 01:10:27.519
Ooh!

01:10:27.603 --> 01:10:29.480
What are you doing?

01:10:29.563 --> 01:10:30.814
Shotgun!

01:10:30.898 --> 01:10:31.940
I want to talk to your mom.

01:10:32.024 --> 01:10:34.276
- Are you insane?
- I know I am.

01:10:34.318 --> 01:10:35.444
What are you thinking?

01:10:35.527 --> 01:10:38.864
How can you entertain ideas
about you and a woman her age?

01:10:38.947 --> 01:10:41.408
What are you talking about?
She looks great.

01:10:41.492 --> 01:10:43.785
Really? Wow.

01:10:43.827 --> 01:10:45.454
No!
You have to disappear!

01:10:45.537 --> 01:10:47.372
I know
it's unconventional, okay?

01:10:47.456 --> 01:10:50.375
And I know nothing can happen.
I'm not stupid.

01:10:50.459 --> 01:10:52.211
I just want to know her.

01:10:52.294 --> 01:10:53.754
I want to talk to her.

01:10:53.837 --> 01:10:56.048
Do not come near
my mother or her fiancé!

01:10:56.131 --> 01:10:57.090
Do you understand?

01:10:57.174 --> 01:10:58.634
I don't understand anything.

01:10:58.675 --> 01:11:02.137
For God's sake, you really need
to find someone your own age.

01:11:05.057 --> 01:11:09.269
Anna, you're beautiful, okay?
But you're not her.

01:11:09.311 --> 01:11:11.647
Stop it! Promise you'll
leave my mother alone.

01:11:11.730 --> 01:11:14.566
Anna Banana!

01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:19.613
I'll give you one thing.

01:11:19.613 --> 01:11:20.823
I'll give you one thing.

01:11:20.906 --> 01:11:23.116
He definitely likes you
for your mind.

01:11:39.174 --> 01:11:40.717
Come on!
Come on!

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:52.020
All right, let's do this.

01:11:55.691 --> 01:11:57.860
Oh, well, there we go.

01:11:57.943 --> 01:11:59.069
Oh, I'll have one.

01:11:59.153 --> 01:12:01.405
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. Did you bring it?

01:12:01.488 --> 01:12:02.865
Right here.
Can you get away?

01:12:02.906 --> 01:12:03.949
Well, I'd love to.

01:12:04.032 --> 01:12:05.450
It's just that
I'm meeting thousands

01:12:05.534 --> 01:12:06.952
of 100-year-old people.

01:12:07.035 --> 01:12:08.871
Those are Ryan's parents.
Hi.

01:12:08.912 --> 01:12:11.707
- Doesn't make them any less old.
- Ryan.

01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:15.544
Do you think I could borrow
my mother for just one minute?

01:12:15.627 --> 01:12:17.045
Sure.

01:12:18.213 --> 01:12:19.256
Ow!

01:12:22.551 --> 01:12:25.429
Okay, there's gotta be
some clue here.

01:12:27.764 --> 01:12:29.349
"A journey soon begins,

01:12:29.433 --> 01:12:32.186
its prize reflected
in another's eyes."

01:12:32.227 --> 01:12:33.812
Okay, that was the switch.

01:12:33.896 --> 01:12:34.938
Oh, let me see.

01:12:35.022 --> 01:12:37.024
Okay, blah, blah.

01:12:37.065 --> 01:12:40.360
"Lack, then selfless love
will change you back."

01:12:40.444 --> 01:12:42.070
So that means
we're stuck like this forever.

01:12:42.154 --> 01:12:44.114
Now is not a moment
for your negativity.

01:12:44.198 --> 01:12:45.866
Let's try to be selfless.

01:12:45.908 --> 01:12:47.743
Give me your hands.

01:12:52.498 --> 01:12:55.000
I'm being selfless.
Are you being selfless?

01:12:55.083 --> 01:12:56.418
Yeah, I'm being selfless.

01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:58.837
You're not doing a good job.
We're still here.

01:12:58.921 --> 01:13:00.756
Oh, right.
So now it's my fault.

01:13:00.839 --> 01:13:04.927
Why is everything always...
It's Jake!

01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:09.515
He must've followed us.
Mom, what're we gonna do?

01:13:09.598 --> 01:13:10.516
Mom?

01:13:11.308 --> 01:13:12.643
Mom!

01:13:12.726 --> 01:13:15.604
Shh! Shh!
Don't scream.

01:13:15.646 --> 01:13:16.855
Just listen to us.

01:13:16.939 --> 01:13:18.649
We are half a block
from the House of Blues.

01:13:18.732 --> 01:13:21.235
Tell 'em you're going to
the bathroom, do the song,

01:13:21.318 --> 01:13:23.946
you'll be back before
they know you've gone.

01:13:24.029 --> 01:13:25.948
I tried to learn your solo,
and I suck.

01:13:25.989 --> 01:13:28.283
Two bands have gone,
and they both blew.

01:13:28.367 --> 01:13:30.244
We might have a chance
if you come.

01:13:30.285 --> 01:13:33.622
When I say I can't,
you don't know the half of it.

01:13:33.705 --> 01:13:35.666
Don't make me do this.

01:13:45.509 --> 01:13:47.386
What are you doing?

01:13:47.469 --> 01:13:50.472
If Ryan sees you here,
it will blow everything.

01:13:50.556 --> 01:13:51.473
I know.
I'm sorry.

01:13:51.557 --> 01:13:54.351
It's just,
when I look into your eyes...

01:13:54.434 --> 01:13:55.435
Stop it!

01:13:55.519 --> 01:13:59.064
Jake, believe me, it is not
me you like, it's Anna.

01:13:59.148 --> 01:14:02.484
No, you're the exciting one.
The musical one.

01:14:02.568 --> 01:14:04.486
Actually, I learned it from her.

01:14:04.528 --> 01:14:05.863
I'm tone-deaf.

01:14:05.946 --> 01:14:07.990
- Tess?
- Shh. Don't move.

01:14:08.073 --> 01:14:08.740
Tess?

01:14:08.824 --> 01:14:10.868
Oh, found it!

01:14:10.951 --> 01:14:12.744
- Found what?
- My earring.

01:14:12.828 --> 01:14:14.997
I thought I lost it.

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.751
Anna's friends decided to crash.

01:14:19.835 --> 01:14:21.211
You guys!

01:14:21.295 --> 01:14:23.046
You know anything about this?

01:14:23.130 --> 01:14:28.468
Well, I think they're trying
to get Anna to go to an audition

01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:31.180
which had to be tonight,
but I said no.

01:14:31.263 --> 01:14:32.514
She had to stay here.

01:14:32.556 --> 01:14:35.058
- You're kidding.
- No, that's how it went down.

01:14:35.142 --> 01:14:36.226
I know it's not important to you

01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:38.353
and that she's just a girl
in a stupid band.

01:14:38.437 --> 01:14:42.357
Look, Dr. Coleman, dude,
I'm really sorry,

01:14:42.399 --> 01:14:44.860
but couldn't we borrow
Anna for 20 minutes?

01:14:44.902 --> 01:14:48.363
We'd never ask you, or
anybody for anything ever again.

01:14:48.405 --> 01:14:51.200
I am appalled at you two.
I clearly said...

01:14:51.241 --> 01:14:52.326
Go.

01:14:53.202 --> 01:14:54.036
What?

01:14:54.077 --> 01:14:55.287
Go.

01:14:55.871 --> 01:14:56.705
Ryan.

01:14:56.788 --> 01:14:59.583
What are you still doing here?
Go! Right now!

01:14:59.666 --> 01:15:01.084
Thank you so much!

01:15:01.168 --> 01:15:04.129
I told you he wouldn't
totally ruin your life!

01:15:04.213 --> 01:15:08.008
Mister Dude, you rock!

01:15:08.050 --> 01:15:09.384
Thanks, Mitch.

01:15:14.264 --> 01:15:16.558
Are you mad?

01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:17.893
No.

01:15:19.812 --> 01:15:22.272
Do you, like, not want
to get married now?

01:15:24.608 --> 01:15:25.692
No.

01:15:27.277 --> 01:15:30.614
No, I don't, not if you're
gonna put me in this role.

01:15:30.697 --> 01:15:31.406
What role?

01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:33.492
The role of
insensitive stepfather

01:15:33.575 --> 01:15:36.286
who couldn't care less or
thinks it's a stupid band,

01:15:36.370 --> 01:15:39.748
or any of the preposterous
things you just said.

01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:42.584
How can you say I don't care?
I'm not that guy.

01:15:42.668 --> 01:15:45.921
If that's who you think I am,
this is never gonna work.

01:15:45.963 --> 01:15:48.841
When I fell in love with you,
I knew you came with a family,

01:15:48.924 --> 01:15:50.843
and I respect
the hell out of that.

01:15:50.926 --> 01:15:52.219
You've always
put the kids first.

01:15:52.261 --> 01:15:55.597
That's exactly how it should be.
That's how I want it.

01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:59.059
I never pushed Anna
because I want her to like me

01:15:59.101 --> 01:16:02.229
on her own terms,
in her own way.

01:16:03.355 --> 01:16:04.773
Wow.

01:16:06.275 --> 01:16:07.192
That's very cool.

01:16:07.276 --> 01:16:08.652
Yeah.

01:16:09.945 --> 01:16:12.447
Now, what are you
still doing here?

01:16:12.489 --> 01:16:13.448
What do you mean?

01:16:13.532 --> 01:16:15.742
You should be over there.

01:16:15.784 --> 01:16:18.036
That's where you ought to be.
Cheering her on.

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.872
That's where I want you to be.

01:16:19.955 --> 01:16:21.623
Go on. Go.

01:16:21.707 --> 01:16:25.752
I can hold down the fort here
for 20 minutes.

01:16:25.794 --> 01:16:27.588
Wish her luck for me.

01:16:29.173 --> 01:16:30.591
Okay.

01:16:44.396 --> 01:16:45.647
Whoa, hold it.

01:16:45.731 --> 01:16:47.816
Oh, you're not serious.
No!

01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:51.445
Okay, great.
I've got I.D. For once.

01:16:51.487 --> 01:16:52.196
Thanks.

01:17:00.996 --> 01:17:03.165
So, it's a good crowd out there.

01:17:04.541 --> 01:17:06.710
Anna, what are you doing?
What's wrong?

01:17:06.793 --> 01:17:07.920
I can't do this.

01:17:08.003 --> 01:17:09.671
Since when do you get nervous?

01:17:09.755 --> 01:17:10.923
No, I really can't.

01:17:11.006 --> 01:17:13.509
Come on, you rock
harder than anyone I know.

01:17:13.592 --> 01:17:16.929
Well, the rocking may be
in short supply tonight, girls.

01:17:17.012 --> 01:17:20.265
- What do you mean?
- I'm just not myself.

01:17:20.349 --> 01:17:22.309
Anna, I know you're stressing.

01:17:22.351 --> 01:17:25.854
We all are, and I know that
maybe it won't be brilliant,

01:17:25.938 --> 01:17:27.481
but we'll forgive each other.

01:17:27.523 --> 01:17:29.441
We'll find some way
to laugh about it.

01:17:29.525 --> 01:17:32.820
Right now, I just really want us
to take this shot, okay?

01:17:32.861 --> 01:17:35.155
We'll still love you,
even if it blows.

01:17:35.197 --> 01:17:36.532
Yeah.

01:17:36.615 --> 01:17:38.575
Okay, okay, okay, I'll try.

01:17:38.659 --> 01:17:40.160
I mean, how hard can it be?

01:17:40.244 --> 01:17:41.328
So don't forget

01:17:41.411 --> 01:17:43.539
we changed the chord
progression in the first verse

01:17:43.622 --> 01:17:46.333
from C-C-D to C-D-C.

01:17:46.375 --> 01:17:48.418
You play notes?

01:17:49.586 --> 01:17:53.465
I mean, I just thought we
could play in the key of "rock"!

01:17:54.383 --> 01:17:56.385
Yeah, okay.
Let's fix your hair.

01:17:56.426 --> 01:17:58.720
Yeah, what's with the bun?

01:18:02.266 --> 01:18:03.225
Mrs. Coleman!

01:18:03.308 --> 01:18:04.852
Jake, stop!

01:18:04.935 --> 01:18:06.603
You're running away from him.

01:18:06.687 --> 01:18:10.399
Jake, if you like me at all,
you will just leave me alone.

01:18:10.482 --> 01:18:11.275
Yeah, but...

01:18:11.358 --> 01:18:13.360
Please, no!

01:18:14.444 --> 01:18:17.823
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage

01:18:17.906 --> 01:18:21.243
the next act in the KllSFM
Wango Tango auditions,

01:18:21.326 --> 01:18:26.373
from right here in Los Angeles,
let's give it up for Pink Slip!

01:18:47.352 --> 01:18:48.770
Do something!

01:19:39.988 --> 01:19:42.407
- What are you doing?
- I can't do this!

01:19:42.491 --> 01:19:44.034
No, it's okay.
I unplugged you.

01:19:44.117 --> 01:19:45.160
Just fake it.

01:19:45.244 --> 01:19:47.454
I don't even know
how to do that.

01:19:47.496 --> 01:19:50.374
You can't tell me you never
went to a rock concert.

01:19:50.457 --> 01:19:52.167
- I saw the Stones once.
- Great!

01:19:52.209 --> 01:19:54.211
Just go out and act like Keith!

01:19:54.294 --> 01:19:55.796
Keith, right, yeah.

01:19:55.879 --> 01:19:56.839
Richards, Mom!

01:19:56.922 --> 01:19:57.965
I knew that.

01:19:58.048 --> 01:19:59.675
Just go act like Keith.

01:19:59.758 --> 01:20:02.094
Act like Keith.
Not the behavior?

01:20:02.177 --> 01:20:03.595
No, just the playing!

01:20:03.679 --> 01:20:06.849
Now get out there!
Your solo's coming!

01:21:05.365 --> 01:21:05.991
Whoo!

01:21:06.074 --> 01:21:08.202
Anna, you rock!

01:21:42.236 --> 01:21:45.030
It's early, but I think
you are definitely in.

01:21:45.113 --> 01:21:46.865
All right!

01:21:46.949 --> 01:21:49.034
- Are we in?
- Yes!

01:21:49.785 --> 01:21:52.621
Oh, it was terrifying.
I had no idea what it takes.

01:21:52.704 --> 01:21:54.206
- The guts.
- Thanks.

01:21:54.289 --> 01:21:56.124
It's exciting.
Your music.

01:21:56.166 --> 01:21:59.169
- It's not noise?
- Most definitely not noise.

01:22:01.255 --> 01:22:03.215
Oh, my God!
Ryan!

01:22:07.928 --> 01:22:09.138
Anna?

01:22:16.854 --> 01:22:16.937
My first wedding
went like this, you know.

01:22:16.937 --> 01:22:19.189
My first wedding
went like this, you know.

01:22:19.273 --> 01:22:22.151
- Like what?
- She ran away with the florist.

01:22:22.234 --> 01:22:24.820
Whole thing
went right down the tubes.

01:22:25.487 --> 01:22:27.281
Don't make me hurt you.

01:22:30.784 --> 01:22:32.661
There she is.

01:22:32.703 --> 01:22:34.621
Look, look, look.

01:22:47.259 --> 01:22:48.677
Mom, what's wrong?

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:51.180
I have to ask you
to do something for me.

01:22:51.221 --> 01:22:54.349
Sure, whatever. After what you
just did for me, anything.

01:22:54.433 --> 01:22:56.935
It needs to happen before
the toasts and speeches.

01:22:57.019 --> 01:22:57.895
Okay.

01:22:57.978 --> 01:23:01.273
Clearly, we're not
switching back tonight.

01:23:01.356 --> 01:23:04.234
I need you to tell Ryan you
need to postpone the wedding.

01:23:04.318 --> 01:23:05.194
What?

01:23:05.277 --> 01:23:08.530
No, listen, I can see
you're not ready for this.

01:23:08.572 --> 01:23:10.324
And I can wait.

01:23:10.365 --> 01:23:11.825
I guess I was so happy,

01:23:11.867 --> 01:23:15.162
I wasn't thinking about
what's best for you and Harry.

01:23:15.204 --> 01:23:16.997
But, Mom.

01:23:17.039 --> 01:23:21.001
If he loves me like I think
he does, he'll wait, too.

01:23:21.084 --> 01:23:23.337
He'll understand.

01:23:23.378 --> 01:23:26.840
He'll be very sweet
and gracious about it.

01:23:26.924 --> 01:23:29.218
But please.

01:23:29.259 --> 01:23:32.012
Just please let him know
that I love him.

01:23:32.054 --> 01:23:36.099
And be as kind as you
possibly can for me.

01:23:37.226 --> 01:23:38.811
Okay, Mom.

01:23:39.728 --> 01:23:41.563
I know exactly what to say.

01:23:41.605 --> 01:23:43.565
I'll be along in a minute.

01:23:57.162 --> 01:23:58.705
You should sit down.

01:24:04.711 --> 01:24:06.004
[Glass dings]

01:24:12.761 --> 01:24:13.762
Hi.

01:24:16.223 --> 01:24:20.102
I guess
I'm gonna start the toasts.

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.813
So, three years ago,

01:24:22.896 --> 01:24:26.233
we had a really bad thing
happen in our family.

01:24:26.275 --> 01:24:30.320
We lost a father and a husband,

01:24:30.404 --> 01:24:34.283
and I didn't think we'd ever
be able to get over it.

01:24:34.324 --> 01:24:35.868
But then...

01:24:37.286 --> 01:24:42.249
This guy next to me
came into the picture.

01:24:43.417 --> 01:24:46.420
And everybody could see
I was happy again.

01:24:47.754 --> 01:24:50.007
I was singing
in the shower again.

01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:52.217
Not well, I might add.

01:24:55.304 --> 01:24:59.850
But I was still really worried
about my kids, Anna and Harry.

01:24:59.933 --> 01:25:06.899
Whether they'd be able to accept
a new man in their life.

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:11.528
And now I know how Anna feels.

01:25:14.198 --> 01:25:16.992
And what she feels is that...

01:25:19.411 --> 01:25:23.081
No one could ever
take the place of her dad...

01:25:26.001 --> 01:25:29.129
Because he was
a really great dad.

01:25:30.339 --> 01:25:36.678
But somebody could be
part of a new family.

01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:42.309
Its own kind of cool,
new, little unit.

01:25:43.685 --> 01:25:46.522
And that for someone
as special as Ryan,

01:25:46.563 --> 01:25:50.025
that we would all
just make a little room.

01:25:52.277 --> 01:25:55.405
Anna really wanted her mom
to know that.

01:26:05.374 --> 01:26:07.292
Earthquake!

01:26:28.689 --> 01:26:29.857
Yeah!

01:26:32.568 --> 01:26:36.029
And I am so psyched to be here!

01:26:36.864 --> 01:26:42.161
I guess all I'm trying to say
is, Ryan, welcome to our family.

01:26:42.244 --> 01:26:44.288
To the bride and groom.

01:26:45.831 --> 01:26:47.499
What the hell just happened?

01:26:47.583 --> 01:26:50.252
Trust me,
you don't want to know.

01:27:21.408 --> 01:27:24.411
Thank you for everything.

01:27:24.495 --> 01:27:25.454
I love you.

01:27:25.496 --> 01:27:27.706
I love you, too.

01:27:31.001 --> 01:27:32.294
What?

01:27:35.422 --> 01:27:37.090
Go.

01:27:37.132 --> 01:27:38.634
Go.

01:27:43.138 --> 01:27:44.139
Hi.

01:27:46.809 --> 01:27:51.271
Listen, I feel really stupid.

01:27:52.314 --> 01:27:56.318
You know, it's just
yesterday was freaky,

01:27:56.401 --> 01:28:00.739
and, I mean, I see your mom,
and I like her.

01:28:00.823 --> 01:28:02.825
I mean, not "like her" like her,

01:28:02.908 --> 01:28:05.786
but, you know, I mean,
like her as your mom.

01:28:06.662 --> 01:28:10.499
Listen, do you think we could
just rewind this whole thing

01:28:10.541 --> 01:28:12.376
and start again?

01:28:12.459 --> 01:28:14.002
I'd like that.

01:28:24.847 --> 01:28:28.225
You know, I've been thinking
about that kiss.

01:28:28.308 --> 01:28:29.810
Kiss?

01:28:32.688 --> 01:28:35.149
Remind me again how I did it.

01:28:36.191 --> 01:28:37.651
In front of your mom?

01:28:37.693 --> 01:28:40.112
It's okay.
She owes me.

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:19.234
Hey, why don't you ask
that girl to dance?

01:29:19.318 --> 01:29:20.152
No way!

01:29:20.235 --> 01:29:23.197
- Come on, go on over there.
- Stop bugging me.

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:26.992
Boy, it's true.
Youth is wasted on the young.

01:29:27.075 --> 01:29:28.785
You go ask her, you old fart.

01:29:28.869 --> 01:29:30.162
Now, wait a minute!

01:29:30.245 --> 01:29:31.955
Why, if I was your age, oh!

01:29:32.039 --> 01:29:32.831
Cookie?

01:29:32.915 --> 01:29:37.085
Well, why, yes,
I don't mind if I do.

01:29:37.169 --> 01:29:40.964
Mama! What are you doing?

01:29:41.048 --> 01:29:42.424
Mama!

01:29:42.466 --> 01:29:45.260
Grandpa! Harry!
No!

01:29:49.181 --> 01:29:51.058
Okay!
