06:14.165 --> 06:17.862
They tell you
what the ingredients are...

06:17.969 --> 06:22.372
and how it's guaranteed
to exterminate any insect in the world,

06:22.474 --> 06:26.171
but they do not tell you
whether or not it's painless.

06:26.277 --> 06:30.873
I believe, insect or man,
death should always be painless.

06:30.982 --> 06:33.280
Wow.

06:45.597 --> 06:50.660
- Sam.
- Sam, there's a lady here for you.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.033
- Yes, miss?
- I'm Marion's sister.

07:00.078 --> 07:03.878
- Oh. Lila.
- Is Marion here?

07:03.948 --> 07:08.385
- Of course not. Is something wrong?
- She left home on Friday.

07:08.453 --> 07:11.445
I was in Tucson over
the weekend, and I haven't heard
from her, not even a phone call.

07:11.489 --> 07:14.754
Look, if you two are in this together,
I don't care. It's none of my business.

07:14.859 --> 07:17.453
But I wanna talk to Marion, and I want
her to tell me it's none of my business.

07:17.562 --> 07:20.053
- And then I'll go!
- Uh, Bob!

07:20.165 --> 07:23.464
- Run out and get yourself lunch.
- That's okay. I brought it with me.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.297
Run out and eat it.

07:31.476 --> 07:34.968
Now what-- what thing
could we be in on together?

07:35.079 --> 07:36.979
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell at you.

07:37.081 --> 07:40.983
Is Marion in trouble?
Or, what is it?

07:41.085 --> 07:43.815
Let's all talk
about Marion, shall we?

07:46.925 --> 07:49.325
Who are you, friend?

07:49.394 --> 07:54.627
My name's Arbogast, friend.
I'm a private investigator.

07:54.699 --> 07:57.327
- Where is she, Miss Crane?
- I don't know you.

07:57.435 --> 08:00.404
I know you don't. If you did,
I wouldn't be able to follow you.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.906
W-What's your interest in this?

08:02.941 --> 08:05.409
Four hundred thousand dollars.

08:06.711 --> 08:09.703
- Four hundred thousand dollars?
- That's right.

08:09.814 --> 08:12.715
One of you better tell me
what's going on here and tell me fast.

08:12.817 --> 08:15.718
- I can--
I can take just so much of this.
- Just take it easy, friend.

08:15.820 --> 08:17.811
Your girlfriend stole $400,000.

08:17.922 --> 08:21.016
What are you talking about?
What is this?

08:21.125 --> 08:24.026
She was supposed to bank it
on Friday for her boss.

08:24.128 --> 08:26.619
She didn't.
No one has seen her since.

08:26.731 --> 08:28.665
Oh, someone's seen her.

08:28.766 --> 08:31.929
Someone always sees a girl
with $400,000.

08:32.035 --> 08:35.836
Sam, they don't wanna prosecute.
They just want the money back.
So if she's here, tell us.

08:35.874 --> 08:38.842
She's not. She isn't.
She ain't here.

08:38.943 --> 08:41.241
Miss Crane, can I ask you a question?

08:41.279 --> 08:43.839
Did you come all the way up here
on a hunch and nothing more?

08:43.948 --> 08:45.848
Not even a hunch.
Just hope.

08:45.884 --> 08:48.751
You know, with a little checking,
I could get to believe you.

08:48.853 --> 08:51.287
I don't care
if you believe me or not.

08:51.356 --> 08:55.258
All I wanna do is find Marion
before she gets into this too deeply.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.954
Yeah. Did you check in Phoenix?
In the hospitals?

08:58.062 --> 09:01.998
- Maybe she had an accident or a holdup.
- No.

09:02.066 --> 09:05.263
She was seen leaving town in her car,
by her employer, I might add.

09:05.370 --> 09:08.771
Well, I can't believe it.
Can you?

09:08.873 --> 09:11.273
Well, you know,

09:11.309 --> 09:15.609
we're always quickest to doubt people
who have a record for being honest.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.614
I think she's here, Miss Crane.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.480
Where there's a boyfriend--

09:20.518 --> 09:25.217
Well, she's not back there with the nuts
and bolts, but she's here in this town.

09:25.290 --> 09:28.782
Somewhere.
I'll find her.

09:36.968 --> 09:39.129
- You haven't seen her?
- No.

09:56.621 --> 09:58.589
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

09:58.623 --> 10:02.491
- I almost drove right past.
- Yeah, I'm always forgetting
to turn the sign on.

10:02.594 --> 10:04.789
But we do have a vacancy.
Twelve, in fact.

10:04.896 --> 10:08.195
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
Some candy?

10:08.232 --> 10:10.166
No, thanks.

10:10.201 --> 10:13.659
Last two days, I've been
to so many motels, my eyes
are bleary with the neon.

10:13.705 --> 10:15.673
But you know,
this is the first one...

10:15.707 --> 10:18.175
that looks like
it's hiding from the world.

10:18.209 --> 10:20.268
I didn't really forget
to turn the sign on.

10:20.378 --> 10:22.676
It just doesn't seem
like much use anymore.

10:22.714 --> 10:27.879
You know, that used to be
the main highway right over there.

10:27.986 --> 10:30.386
- Wanna come in and register?
- No. No, no, no. Sit down.

10:30.488 --> 10:33.013
Don't wanna trouble you.
Just wanna ask you some questions.

10:33.124 --> 10:35.092
No trouble at all.
Today's linen day.

10:35.193 --> 10:38.720
I change the beds here once a week,
whether they've been used or not.

10:38.830 --> 10:40.889
I just hate the smell
of dampness, you know?

10:40.999 --> 10:44.491
Such a-- I don't know--
kind of a creepy smell.

10:44.602 --> 10:47.503
Come on.

10:47.538 --> 10:51.804
- You out to buy a motel?
- Uh, no.

10:51.909 --> 10:54.810
The reason I ask is because
you said you'd seen so many
in the past couple days.

10:54.912 --> 10:57.005
I thought maybe you--
What was it you wanted to ask me?

10:57.115 --> 10:59.015
Looking for a missing person.

10:59.117 --> 11:03.019
- My name's Arbogast.
I'm a private investigator.
- Mm-hmm.

11:03.054 --> 11:07.115
I'm trying to trace a girl that's been
missing for, oh, about a week now.

11:07.225 --> 11:11.719
- Mm-hmm.
- From Phoenix. It's a private matter.

11:11.829 --> 11:14.821
Family wants to forgive her.
She's not in any trouble.

11:14.866 --> 11:17.835
I didn't think the police went looking
for people who aren't in any trouble.

11:17.869 --> 11:20.429
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah. Private investigator.

11:22.540 --> 11:25.236
Uh, we have reason to believe
she came along this way.

11:25.343 --> 11:29.541
Might've stopped in the area.
Did, uh, she stop here?

11:29.580 --> 11:32.242
No one's stopped here
for a couple weeks.

11:32.350 --> 11:35.285
- Mind looking at the picture
before committing yourself?
- Commit myself?

11:35.353 --> 11:39.084
- You sure sound like a policeman.
- Look at the picture, please.

11:39.157 --> 11:41.387
- Mm-mm.
- You're sure.

11:41.459 --> 11:43.450
Yeah.

11:43.494 --> 11:46.054
Well, it's possible
she used an alias.

11:46.164 --> 11:50.100
Marion Crane is her real name,
but she could've registered
under a different one.

11:50.201 --> 11:53.693
I don't even bother registering
people anymore. One by one,
you sort of drop formalities.

11:53.805 --> 11:57.764
I shouldn't even be changing the sheets,
but old habits die hard.

11:57.809 --> 11:59.777
Oh, which reminds me.

12:00.878 --> 12:03.472
- What's that?
- The lights. The sign.

12:03.581 --> 12:06.209
We had a couple last week,
said if it hadn't been on,
they would've driven right past.

12:06.317 --> 12:09.980
- It looked like a deserted--
- Now, you see, that's my point.

12:10.088 --> 12:11.988
You said, nobody had been here
for a couple of weeks.

12:12.090 --> 12:13.990
Now there's this couple
came by, and...

12:14.092 --> 12:16.526
- Y eah. Y eah.
- they didn't know you were open.

12:16.594 --> 12:19.563
Well, as you say,
old habits die hard.

12:19.597 --> 12:21.963
It's possible this girl registered
under a different name.

12:21.999 --> 12:25.127
- Could I look at your book?
- Mm-hmm.

12:25.236 --> 12:27.136
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

12:27.238 --> 12:31.174
I got the, uh--
got the date here somewhere.

12:31.275 --> 12:33.470
See? There's no one there.

12:33.578 --> 12:35.876
I got a sample
of her handwriting.

12:41.385 --> 12:46.755
Oh, yeah, here we are. ""Marie Samuels.""
That's an interesting alias.

12:46.858 --> 12:49.486
- Is that her?
- Yeah, I think so.

12:49.594 --> 12:55.055
Marie-- Marion. Samuels.
Her boyfriend's name is Sam.

12:55.099 --> 12:58.159
Was she in disguise, by any chance?
You wanna look at the picture again?

12:58.269 --> 13:01.170
Look, Mr. Arbogast,
I'm not lying to you. It's just that--

13:01.272 --> 13:03.069
No, I know that.
I know you wouldn't lie.

13:03.107 --> 13:06.702
It's just i-i-it's hard
to keep track of time around here.

13:06.811 --> 13:09.302
Oh, I know, I know.

13:12.817 --> 13:14.785
Oh, yeah.

13:16.320 --> 13:19.983
Yeah, it was raining that night,
and her hair was all wet.

13:20.091 --> 13:22.616
And I'll tell ya, that's not
a very good picture of her either.

13:22.727 --> 13:24.495
No, I guess not.

13:24.495 --> 13:27.794
- At all.
- I guess not. Tell me all about her.

13:27.899 --> 13:31.892
Well, she arrived rather late
one night and went to sleep...

13:32.003 --> 13:33.834
and left early in the morning.

13:33.905 --> 13:35.839
- How early?
- Very early.

13:35.907 --> 13:38.899
- Which morning was this?
- The next day, so, Sunday.

13:39.010 --> 13:43.709
- Mm-hmm. Did, uh, anyone meet her here?
- Uh-uh.

13:43.748 --> 13:46.410
- Did she arrive with anyone?
- Nope.

13:46.517 --> 13:50.351
- Did she make any phone calls or, uh--
- Mm-mm.

13:50.421 --> 13:52.548
- Locally?
- Uh-uh.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.524
- You spend the night with her?
- No.

13:55.626 --> 13:59.562
Well, then, how do you know she didn't
make any phone calls?

13:59.664 --> 14:01.859
Well, we, um--

14:01.933 --> 14:06.427
Well, she-she was
very tired, and--

14:06.537 --> 14:08.869
I-l-- I'm starting
to remember it now.

14:08.940 --> 14:13.775
I'm making a mental picture
of it in my mind.

14:13.845 --> 14:17.645
Do you know how you do that?
How you make a mental
picturization of something?

14:17.748 --> 14:19.648
That's right.
Take your time.

14:19.750 --> 14:24.380
She was, uh--
Y eah, she was sitting back there.

14:24.455 --> 14:28.585
Mm-mm. She was standing back there,
and she had a sandwich in her hand,

14:28.659 --> 14:32.561
and she said that she had
a long drive ahead of her,

14:32.663 --> 14:36.064
so she went to bed,
uh, straight to bed.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.158
- Back where?
- Back from where she came from.

14:38.269 --> 14:41.500
You said before, she was sitting
or standing ""back there""?

14:41.572 --> 14:43.767
Yes. In my parlor back there.

14:43.808 --> 14:46.504
She said she was very hungry,
so I made her a sandwich,

14:46.577 --> 14:51.412
and, uh, she, uh, said she was tired
and went straight to sleep.

14:51.482 --> 14:53.416
Oh, I see.

14:53.484 --> 14:55.475
How'd she pay you?
A check, cash?

14:55.586 --> 14:59.283
- Cash.
- Oh, cash, huh? Hmm.

14:59.357 --> 15:02.554
- After she left, she didn't come back?
- Why would she?

15:02.660 --> 15:05.561
Y eah.

15:05.663 --> 15:07.654
Well, I guess that's about it,
Mr. Arbogast.

15:07.765 --> 15:10.501
So, uh, I got some work to do,
if you don't mind.

15:10.501 --> 15:12.503
To tell you the truth,
I do mind.

15:12.503 --> 15:16.496
If it don't jell, it ain't Jell-O,
and this just ain't jelling.

15:16.607 --> 15:20.008
It's not coming together somehow.
Something's missing.

15:20.077 --> 15:23.069
I don't know what else you could expect
me to know. People just come and go.

15:23.180 --> 15:27.173
That's right.
She's not still here, is she?

15:27.285 --> 15:29.981
- No.
- Mm.

15:30.021 --> 15:34.287
If I wanted to check the cabins, all 12
of 'em, would I need a warrant for that?

15:34.392 --> 15:39.091
If you don't believe me, you can help me
change the beds, if you like.

15:39.130 --> 15:42.691
Uh, no.
No, thanks.

16:04.322 --> 16:06.756
Change your mind?

16:06.824 --> 16:10.920
You know, I must have one of those faces
you just can't help believing.

16:11.028 --> 16:12.928
- Is anyone at home?
- No.

16:13.030 --> 16:15.692
Oh, there's someone
sitting up in the window.

16:15.733 --> 16:18.201
- No, there isn't.
- Oh, sure, go ahead, take a look.

16:18.302 --> 16:22.739
Oh, that-that's my mother.
She's an in-- invalid.

16:22.807 --> 16:26.504
An inval-- An invalid.
It's practically like living alone.

16:26.610 --> 16:29.101
Oh, I see.

16:29.213 --> 16:32.614
If this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would ya?

16:34.518 --> 16:38.511
- No.
- Not even if she paid you
a lot of money?

16:38.622 --> 16:40.556
- No.
- Well, let's just say,

16:40.658 --> 16:43.923
for the sake of argument, that she
wanted you to gallantly protect her.

16:44.028 --> 16:46.929
You'd know you were being used. You
wouldn't be made a fool of, would ya?

16:47.031 --> 16:51.263
I'm not a fool. I'm not capable of
being made a fool, not even by a woman.

16:51.335 --> 16:53.269
It's not a slur on your manhood.
I'm sorry.

16:53.337 --> 16:57.831
Let's put it this way.
She might've made a fool of me,
but she didn't fool my mother.

16:57.942 --> 16:59.842
Well, then, your mother met her?
Could I talk to your mother?

16:59.944 --> 17:01.878
-As I just told you, she-she's confined.
-Yeah.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.470
But just for a few minutes.
I-- That's all.

17:04.582 --> 17:07.346
There might be some hint
that you overlooked.

17:07.385 --> 17:09.353
Sick old women
are usually pretty sharp.

17:09.453 --> 17:11.853
Mr. Arbogast,
l-I explained to you now--

17:11.955 --> 17:14.151
Just for a moment.
I wouldn't disturb her.

17:14.191 --> 17:16.659
I've talked to you
all I want to.

17:16.694 --> 17:21.790
- Yes, but just for one moment.
- I think it'd be much better
if you left now.

17:21.866 --> 17:27.065
Okay. You know, you'd save me
a lot of legwork if you'd just
let me talk to her about--

17:27.104 --> 17:29.197
- Do I need a warrant for that too?
- Sure.

17:29.306 --> 17:32.275
All right.
Thanks anyway.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.941
Oh! Hello, Loomis?
It's Arbogast. Is Lila there?

18:14.051 --> 18:16.451
Can I talk to her, please?

18:18.189 --> 18:22.148
Hello, Lila. Lila, listen.
Marion was up here.

18:22.259 --> 18:25.160
Y ep. She spent last Saturday night
at the Bates Motel.

18:25.262 --> 18:27.162
It's out here
on the old highway.

18:27.264 --> 18:30.665
I even know what cabin she was in.
Cabin number one.

18:30.768 --> 18:33.601
Well, the young fella
that runs the place said...

18:33.671 --> 18:36.606
she just spent the night,
left the next day, and that was it.

18:36.674 --> 18:39.268
No. No, not exactly.

18:39.376 --> 18:41.469
Well, I did question him.
Believe me.

18:43.581 --> 18:46.209
I'll have to pick up
the pieces from here.

18:47.618 --> 18:51.577
Well, I tell ya,
I don't feel entirely satisfied.

18:51.622 --> 18:54.022
See, this boy has
a sick old mother.

18:54.091 --> 18:57.026
I think she saw Marion
and talked to her.

18:57.094 --> 19:02.031
No. No. Unfortunately,
he wouldn't let me see her.

19:02.099 --> 19:06.536
Well, I was. I think
I'll go back to the motel first.

19:06.637 --> 19:10.004
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in an hour.

19:10.040 --> 19:12.008
All right.

19:59.690 --> 20:01.658
Bates?

22:31.475 --> 22:34.933
Sometimes, Saturday night has
a lonely sound. Ever notice that, Lila?

22:35.045 --> 22:38.947
Sam, please.
He said an hour or less.

22:41.652 --> 22:43.586
Y ep.
Been three.

22:43.654 --> 22:46.589
Are we just gonna sit here
and wait?

22:48.459 --> 22:51.553
He'll be back.
Sit still.

22:51.595 --> 22:53.563
Hang on.

22:55.566 --> 22:58.592
How far is it to the old highway?

22:58.669 --> 23:02.366
You wanna go out there, don't ya?
Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady.

23:02.406 --> 23:04.465
- Maybe scare her a little bit.
- Yeah.

23:04.508 --> 23:08.877
- Wouldn't be wise.
- Patience doesn't run in my family.
I'm going out there.

23:08.912 --> 23:12.075
- Arbogast said--
- An hour or less.

23:12.116 --> 23:14.584
All right.
I'll call out there.

23:20.624 --> 23:23.923
Well, I'm goin'.

23:25.396 --> 23:27.387
You'll never find it.

23:27.498 --> 23:28.897
- Lila.
- What?

23:28.999 --> 23:32.560
- I'll go. You stay here.
- Why can't I go with you?

23:32.669 --> 23:35.069
I don't know. One of us has to be here
in case he's on the way.

23:35.205 --> 23:37.730
What am I supposed to do?
Just sit here and wait?

23:37.775 --> 23:41.040
Yeah.

23:41.145 --> 23:43.045
Have another beer.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.866
Mr. Arbogast?

24:05.169 --> 24:07.069
Mr. Arbogast?

24:10.374 --> 24:12.308
Arbogast!

24:28.592 --> 24:31.891
- Did he come back here?
- Sam.

24:31.929 --> 24:35.490
No Arbogast. No Bates.
Only the old lady at home.

24:35.532 --> 24:39.525
Sick old lady unable to answer the door,
or unwilling.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.696
Where could he have gone?

24:41.805 --> 24:44.706
Maybe he had a lead.
Maybe he went right on ahead and--

24:44.808 --> 24:47.106
- Without calling me?
- In a hurry.

24:47.144 --> 24:50.204
Sam, he called when he had nothing,
nothing but a dissatisfied feeling.

24:50.314 --> 24:54.216
Don't you think he would've called
if he had anything at all?

24:56.220 --> 24:58.711
Y eah, I think
he would have.

24:58.822 --> 25:00.949
- Let's go see Al Chambers.
- Who's he?

25:01.024 --> 25:03.219
He's our deputy sheriff
around here.

25:03.327 --> 25:05.227
Let me get my Walkman.

25:09.233 --> 25:12.066
Now, your sister's
been missing how long?

25:12.135 --> 25:14.831
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday,
without a trace.

25:14.938 --> 25:19.170
How'd you and this detective
come to trace her to Fairvale?

25:19.243 --> 25:22.940
Uh, they thought
that she'd be coming to me.

25:22.980 --> 25:25.744
- Left Phoenix under her own steam?
- Y eah.

25:25.782 --> 25:29.684
Then she's not missing
so much as she's run away.

25:29.753 --> 25:32.688
- Y eah, that's right.
- From what?

25:34.458 --> 25:36.449
She stole some money.

25:36.493 --> 25:39.462
- A lot?
- Four hundred thousand dollars.

25:40.964 --> 25:43.057
And the police haven't
been able to--

25:43.166 --> 25:45.566
Everyone concerned thought that if they
could get her to give the money back,

25:45.602 --> 25:48.696
they could avoid involving her
with the police.

25:48.772 --> 25:52.071
Explains the private detective.
He traced her to the Bates place.

25:52.109 --> 25:54.077
What exactly did he say
when he called?

25:54.177 --> 25:57.078
He said that Marion stayed there
for one night, and then she left.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.080
With the $400,000?

25:59.182 --> 26:01.776
He didn't say anything about
the money. It's not important
what he said on the phone.

26:01.818 --> 26:04.787
He was supposed to come back after he
talked to the mother, and he didn't.

26:04.821 --> 26:08.621
- That's what I want you
to do something about.
- Like what?

26:08.692 --> 26:10.592
I-I'm sorry if I seem overanxious.

26:10.627 --> 26:13.926
It's just that something is wrong
out there, and I have to know what.

26:13.997 --> 26:17.330
Well, I think there's something
wrong too, but not the same thing.

26:17.434 --> 26:19.561
I think what's wrong
is your private detective.

26:19.636 --> 26:22.469
I think he got a hot lead
as to where your sister was going,

26:22.539 --> 26:24.473
probably from Norman Bates,

26:24.541 --> 26:28.136
and called to keep you still
while he took off after
your sister and the money.

26:28.245 --> 26:31.373
No, he said he was dissatisfied
and was going back there.

26:31.415 --> 26:34.816
Why don't you call Norman
and just let him say what happened?

26:39.323 --> 26:44.090
Florrie, the sheriff wants you
to connect him with the Bates Motel.

26:47.297 --> 26:50.027
Norman?
Sheriff Chambers.

26:50.100 --> 26:53.433
I've been just fine, thanks.
Listen, we got worries here.

26:53.503 --> 26:56.495
Did you have a fellow
stop out there tonight?

26:56.540 --> 26:58.940
No, this one wouldn't be
a customer anyway.

26:59.009 --> 27:01.409
- It's a private detective, name of--
- Arbogast.

27:01.511 --> 27:03.411
Arbogast.

27:06.617 --> 27:09.450
And after he left?

27:09.519 --> 27:11.544
No, that's okay, Norman.

27:11.622 --> 27:13.556
Well, this detective was there.

27:13.624 --> 27:17.253
Norman told him about the girl,
the detective thanked him, went away.

27:17.327 --> 27:20.922
He didn't come back?
Didn't see the mother?

27:20.964 --> 27:24.263
Your detective told you that
he couldn't come back right away...

27:24.334 --> 27:26.734
because he wanted to question
Norman Bates' mother?

27:26.837 --> 27:28.634
- Is that right?
- Y eah.

27:28.739 --> 27:30.730
Norman Bates' mother
has been dead and buried...

27:30.774 --> 27:33.368
in Green Lawn Cemetery
for the past ten years.

27:33.443 --> 27:38.278
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

27:38.348 --> 27:41.340
It ain't only local history, Sam.

27:41.385 --> 27:46.345
It's the only case of murder and suicide
on the Fairvale ledgers.

27:46.390 --> 27:49.450
Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy
she was involved with...

27:49.559 --> 27:52.153
- when she found out he was married.
- Oh.

27:52.195 --> 27:55.460
Then she took a helping
of the same stuff herself.

27:55.565 --> 27:59.399
Strychnine.
An ugly way to die.

27:59.469 --> 28:02.370
Norman found them dead together.
In bed.

28:04.775 --> 28:09.678
You mean, that old woman
I saw sittin' in the window
is not Norman Bates' mother?

28:09.780 --> 28:13.272
Now just a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?

28:13.383 --> 28:16.284
Y eah. In the house
behind the motel.

28:16.386 --> 28:20.288
I called and pounded,
but she just ignored me.

28:20.390 --> 28:24.884
Well, if the woman up there
is Mrs. Bates,

28:24.995 --> 28:28.192
who's that woman buried
out in Green Lawn Cemetery?

29:07.237 --> 29:11.341
Mother, l, uh,
have to take you downstairs.

29:11.341 --> 29:14.435
I am sorry, boy,

29:14.544 --> 29:18.139
but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders.

29:18.248 --> 29:24.153
- Please, Mother.
- No, I will not hide
in the fruit cellar.

29:24.187 --> 29:28.055
Think I'm fruity, huh?
I'm staying right here.

29:28.091 --> 29:31.356
This is my room,
and no one will drag me out of it,

29:31.461 --> 29:34.191
Ieast of all my big, bold son.

29:34.264 --> 29:36.198
They'll come now, Mother.

29:36.266 --> 29:39.497
He came after the girl.
Now someone will come after him.

29:39.569 --> 29:43.403
Mother, please,
it's just for a few days.

29:43.473 --> 29:45.907
Just for a few days
so they don't find you.

29:45.976 --> 29:48.570
""Just for a few days.""

29:48.678 --> 29:50.578
In that dank fruit cellar?

29:50.680 --> 29:54.582
No! You hid me there once, boy,
and you won't do it again.

29:54.618 --> 30:00.181
Get out! Norman, what do you think
you're going to do?

30:00.290 --> 30:03.191
Don't you touch me.
Don't!

30:03.226 --> 30:06.889
Put me down,
and I'll walk on my own.

30:16.406 --> 30:19.842
Guess we better decide what we're gonna
say and do when we walk in there.

30:19.910 --> 30:23.402
We're gonna register
as man and wife,

30:23.446 --> 30:25.641
and then we're gonna
get shown to a cabin,

30:25.715 --> 30:30.448
and we're gonna search every inch
of that place inside and out.

30:51.374 --> 30:54.468
Nope. I wonder where Norman Bates
does his hermiting?

30:54.544 --> 30:57.479
Someone's in the window.
I just saw something move.

30:59.482 --> 31:02.246
-Well.
-We were just coming up to ring for you.

31:02.352 --> 31:04.252
Suppose you want a room.

31:04.354 --> 31:07.255
Yeah, we were gonna try to make it
all the way to San Francisco,

31:07.290 --> 31:09.758
but we don't like
the look of that sky.

31:09.793 --> 31:12.887
Looks like a bad day coming up.

31:12.963 --> 31:14.897
Okay.

31:20.070 --> 31:22.368
Take you to cabin ten.

31:22.405 --> 31:25.670
- Uh, better sign in first.
- No, it isn't necessary.

31:25.709 --> 31:29.770
No, my boss paid
for this trip,

31:29.813 --> 31:33.180
and it's 90% business,

31:33.283 --> 31:35.376
so he wants practically
notarized receipts.

31:35.485 --> 31:38.386
I think we better sign in
and get a receipt.

31:38.488 --> 31:40.080
Mm-hmm.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.953
Thank you.

31:50.901 --> 31:52.892
- All right.
- All right.

31:53.003 --> 31:54.994
I'll get your bags.

31:55.105 --> 31:57.198
Uh, haven't any.

31:57.307 --> 31:59.605
I'll show you
to your room then.

31:59.643 --> 32:01.611
First time I ever seen
that happen.

32:01.678 --> 32:07.207
You check into any place
in this country without a bag,
you got to pay in advance.

32:08.618 --> 32:12.213
- Thirty-six dollars and fifty cents.
- All righty.

32:17.994 --> 32:20.588
All righty.

32:20.630 --> 32:23.394
That receipt?

32:25.201 --> 32:27.533
I'll go on ahead.

32:30.807 --> 32:33.401
There's your receipt.
I'll show you the cabin.

32:33.510 --> 32:36.741
Nah, that's okay.
Don't bother yourself. We'll find it.

33:02.339 --> 33:05.240
We gotta go in there
and search that cabin, Sam,

33:05.342 --> 33:08.539
no matter what we're afraid of finding,
or how much it may hurt.

33:08.578 --> 33:10.546
I know.

33:10.580 --> 33:13.140
You think if something happened,
it happened here?

33:13.183 --> 33:16.550
I don't know. If you had
a useless business like this motel,

33:16.653 --> 33:21.090
what would it take to get out,
get a new business someplace else?

33:21.157 --> 33:23.853
Four hundred thousand dollars?

33:25.161 --> 33:27.789
Well, how can we prove that?

33:27.864 --> 33:29.991
There's got to be some proof
that exists right now,

33:30.066 --> 33:32.660
something that proves he got
that money away from Marion somehow.

33:32.702 --> 33:37.196
What makes
you sound so certain?

33:37.273 --> 33:40.367
Arbogast.
He liked me, Sam.

33:40.477 --> 33:42.377
Felt sorry for me. He was starting
to feel the same way about you.

33:42.479 --> 33:44.879
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

33:44.914 --> 33:47.474
He wouldn't have gone anywhere without
telling us unless he was stopped.

33:47.584 --> 33:50.314
And he was stopped,
so he must've found out something.

33:50.387 --> 33:53.823
All right.
We'll start with cabin one.

34:29.324 --> 34:31.225
Bates?

35:12.168 --> 35:14.068
No shower curtain.

35:14.170 --> 35:16.070
Sam, look.

35:16.172 --> 35:18.970
- What is it?
- Figuring that didn't get washed down.

35:19.008 --> 35:22.375
Look, some figure's been added to
or subtracted from 400,000.

35:22.412 --> 35:24.471
Proves Marion was here.
It's too wild a coincidence.

35:24.514 --> 35:28.280
Wait a minute.
Bates never denied she was here.

35:28.384 --> 35:30.784
Uh--

35:30.887 --> 35:35.085
Doesn't it prove he found out
about the money?

35:35.125 --> 35:37.685
-Should we ask him where he's hidden it?
-No.

35:37.794 --> 35:40.888
But that old woman, whoever she is,
she told Arbogast something.

35:40.997 --> 35:42.897
I want her to tell us
the same thing.

35:42.999 --> 35:45.627
- Hey, you can't go up there.
- Why not?

35:45.702 --> 35:47.795
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.

35:47.837 --> 35:50.397
One of us can keep him occupied, and
the other one can get to the old woman.

35:50.507 --> 35:53.408
You won't be able to hold him still,
if he doesn't wanna be held.

35:53.510 --> 35:55.603
I don't like you going
up in that house alone.

35:55.645 --> 35:59.103
I can handle a sick old woman.

35:59.149 --> 36:02.812
All right. I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

36:18.568 --> 36:20.763
- Looking for me?
- Uh, yeah, matter of fact.

36:20.837 --> 36:24.273
Uh, wife's taking a nap,
and, uh,

36:24.340 --> 36:26.831
I can never keep
quiet enough for her...

36:26.943 --> 36:30.344
so I thought maybe
I'd look you up and talk.

36:30.446 --> 36:33.882
Good.
Satisfied with your cabin?

36:33.950 --> 36:36.544
Oh, it's fine.

37:30.240 --> 37:32.174
Mrs. Bates?

37:32.275 --> 37:35.005
You're alone here,
aren't you?

37:35.078 --> 37:37.171
It would drive me crazy.

37:37.280 --> 37:40.113
That'd be a rather extreme reaction,
don't you think?

37:40.183 --> 37:44.119
That's just an expression.
What I meant was, uh, I'd do
just about anything to get away.

37:44.187 --> 37:46.485
Wouldn't you?

37:46.589 --> 37:48.489
No.

37:48.591 --> 37:51.389
Mrs. Bates?

37:54.297 --> 37:57.027
Mrs. Bates?

38:55.358 --> 38:58.759
I'm not saying
you shouldn't be contented here.
I'm just doubtin' that you are.

38:58.861 --> 39:03.696
I think if you saw a chance
to get out from under here,
you'd unload this place.

39:03.766 --> 39:05.961
""This place""?

39:06.069 --> 39:08.697
This place happens to be
my only world.

39:08.771 --> 39:11.968
See, I grew up in that house up there
and had a very happy childhood.

39:12.075 --> 39:15.476
My mother and me...
were more than happy.

39:56.853 --> 40:00.220
You seem frightened.
Am I saying something frightening?

40:00.256 --> 40:02.224
I don't know
what you're saying.

40:02.258 --> 40:05.716
I'm talkin' about your mother,
about your motel.

40:06.729 --> 40:09.823
- How you gonna do it?
- Do what?

40:09.899 --> 40:13.164
Buy a new one, in a new town...

40:13.269 --> 40:16.170
where you won't
have to hide your mother.

40:16.272 --> 40:20.106
Why don't you just get in your car
and drive away from here.

40:20.176 --> 40:23.168
Where you gonna get that kind of money?
Or, do you already have it somewhere?

40:23.279 --> 40:26.271
- Shut up! Shut up.
- Huh?

40:26.382 --> 40:29.283
A lot of it.
Four hundred thousand dollars.

40:29.385 --> 40:32.718
I bet your mother knows where it is
and what you did to get it.

40:32.789 --> 40:35.724
Where's that girl
that you came here with?

40:37.593 --> 40:39.891
I'll bet she'll tell us.

41:53.736 --> 41:55.636
Mrs. Bates?

43:04.774 --> 43:06.742
So, Norman.

43:06.776 --> 43:10.507
If anybody can get any answers,
it'll be the psychiatrist.

43:10.546 --> 43:14.915
Even I couldn't get to Norman,
and he knows me.

43:14.984 --> 43:17.885
You warm enough, miss?

43:17.987 --> 43:21.388
Did he talk to you?

43:21.490 --> 43:23.822
No.

43:23.893 --> 43:28.091
I got the whole story,
but not from Norman.

43:28.130 --> 43:30.098
I got it from his mother.

43:30.132 --> 43:33.192
Norman Bates no longer exists.

43:33.302 --> 43:36.396
He only half-existed
to begin with.

43:36.439 --> 43:39.408
Now, the other half
has taken over.

43:39.442 --> 43:41.410
Probably for all time.

43:41.444 --> 43:44.413
- Did he kill my sister?
- Y es.

43:44.513 --> 43:48.108
I'm sorry.
The private investigator too.

43:48.150 --> 43:51.608
If you drag the swamp
in the vicinity of the motel--

43:54.123 --> 43:58.219
To understand it as I understood it,
hearing it from the ""mother""--

43:58.327 --> 44:01.421
that is, the mother-half
of Norman's mind--

44:01.464 --> 44:03.455
you have to go back ten years...

44:03.532 --> 44:07.229
to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

44:08.838 --> 44:11.238
He was already
dangerously disturbed.

44:11.340 --> 44:14.138
Had been ever since his father died.

44:14.243 --> 44:17.974
His mother was
a clinging, demanding woman,

44:18.047 --> 44:22.984
and for years they lived as if
there was no one else in the world.

44:23.052 --> 44:24.253
Then she found a man,
and it seemed to Norman that
she threw him over for this man.

44:24.253 --> 44:28.053
Then she found a man,
and it seemed to Norman that
she threw him over for this man.

44:28.157 --> 44:31.752
That pushed him over the thin line,
and he killed them both.

44:31.861 --> 44:36.958
So, he had to erase the crime,
at least in his mind.

44:36.999 --> 44:41.368
He stole her corpse,
and a weighted coffin was buried.

44:41.470 --> 44:44.598
He hid the body in the fruit cellar
and treated it...

44:44.674 --> 44:49.270
to keep it
as well as it would keep.

44:49.378 --> 44:54.077
And that still wasn't enough.
She was there, but she was a corpse.

44:54.116 --> 44:58.018
So, he began to think
and speak for her.

44:58.087 --> 45:00.988
At times, he could be
both personalities,

45:01.023 --> 45:02.991
carry on conversations.

45:03.025 --> 45:06.620
At other times,
the mother-half took over completely.

45:06.696 --> 45:11.497
He was never all Norman,
but he was often only ""Mother."

45:11.534 --> 45:13.900
When he met your sister,

45:14.003 --> 45:17.905
he was touched by her
and aroused by her.

45:18.007 --> 45:22.603
He wanted her.
This set off his jealous mother.

45:22.645 --> 45:26.012
And ""Mother"" killed the girl.

45:26.115 --> 45:29.846
Whenever reality came too close,

45:29.919 --> 45:34.720
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion,

45:34.757 --> 45:38.454
he'd dress up--
even to a cheap wig he'd bought--

45:38.527 --> 45:42.190
and he'd walk about the house,
sit in her chair,

45:42.298 --> 45:45.096
speak in her voice.

45:45.134 --> 45:48.626
He tried to be his mother.

45:50.940 --> 45:53.568
And now he is.

45:53.676 --> 45:57.578
- And the $400,000? Who got that?
- The swamp.

45:57.680 --> 46:00.979
These were crimes of passion,
not profit.

46:02.384 --> 46:06.616
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?

46:06.689 --> 46:08.782
- Sure.
- All right.

46:24.306 --> 46:26.206
Thank you.

46:34.817 --> 46:40.449
It's sad when a mother has to speak
the words that condemn her own son,

46:40.523 --> 46:44.926
but I couldn't allow them to believe
that I would commit murder.

46:44.960 --> 46:46.928
They'll put him away now,

46:46.962 --> 46:49.931
as I should have years ago.

46:49.965 --> 46:53.128
He was always bad.

46:53.235 --> 46:58.832
And in the end, he intended to tell them
that I killed those girls and that man.

46:58.874 --> 47:02.435
As if I could do anything
except just sit and stare,

47:02.478 --> 47:04.844
Iike one of his stuffed birds.

47:04.880 --> 47:10.341
Well, they know I can't even
move a finger, and I won't.

47:10.386 --> 47:12.877
I'll just sit here
and be quiet,

47:12.955 --> 47:17.119
just in case they do suspect me.

47:17.226 --> 47:21.026
They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.

47:21.063 --> 47:23.725
Let them see
what kind of a person I am.

47:23.833 --> 47:25.824
I'm not even gonna
swat that fly.

47:25.935 --> 47:28.233
- I hope they are watching.
- They're probably watching me.

47:28.270 --> 47:31.239
- They'll see.
- Well, I'll let 'em.

47:31.273 --> 47:33.332
They'll see, and they'll know.

47:33.442 --> 47:38.539
And they'll say,
""Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly."

47:54.663 --> 47:57.598
Yeah, you're gonna
get stuck on somethin'.

47:57.666 --> 47:59.600
Keep pullin'.

48:56.992 --> 48:59.825
- Don't go in there.
- Guys, it's done!

48:59.895 --> 49:02.329
It's all clear here.
Comin' through!

49:02.398 --> 49:04.628
All right, comin' through.
