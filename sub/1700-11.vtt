00:02.377 --> 00:04.545
Do you think they have
yesterday's Daily News?

00:04.713 --> 00:06.714
- Why?
- I just wanna check my horoscope...

00:06.881 --> 00:08.507
...see if it was right.

00:09.968 --> 00:13.762
Oh, my God. Phoebe. Don't look now,
but, behind you there's a guy...

00:13.930 --> 00:16.890
...who has the potential to break our hearts
and plunge us into depression.

00:17.058 --> 00:18.517
Where?

00:18.893 --> 00:21.103
Ooh, come to Mama.

00:21.771 --> 00:24.106
Okay, he's coming.
Be cool. Be cool. Be cool.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.567
- Nice hat.
- Thanks.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.945
- We should do something. Whistle.
- We're not gonna whistle.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.321
- Yeah, come on, do it.
- No.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.490
- Do it. Do it. Do it.
- Woo-hoo!

00:38.955 --> 00:41.331
I can't believe you did that.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.298
Why did I woo-hoo?

01:31.466 --> 01:33.884
I mean, what was I hoping?
He'd turn around and say:

01:34.052 --> 01:36.220
"Ooh, I love that sound.
I must have you now"?

01:37.847 --> 01:39.556
I just wish there was something
we could do.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.478
Hello. Hello, coma guy.

01:46.314 --> 01:48.398
Get up, you Girl Scout! Up, up, up!

01:48.566 --> 01:51.151
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- Maybe nobody's tried this.

01:54.781 --> 01:57.241
I wish we at least knew his name.

01:57.408 --> 01:59.034
Would you look at that face?

01:59.202 --> 02:03.288
I mean, even sleeping he looks smart.
I bet he's a lawyer.

02:03.456 --> 02:06.917
Yeah, but did you see the dents
in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.

02:07.460 --> 02:11.588
Okay. He's a lawyer who teaches
sculpting on the side.

02:11.756 --> 02:14.007
And he can dance.

02:14.175 --> 02:18.220
And he's the kind of guy who,
when you're talking, he's listening...

02:18.388 --> 02:20.722
...you know, and not saying,
"Yeah, I understand"...

02:20.890 --> 02:23.809
...but wondering what you look like naked.
- Oh, stop it.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.772
I wish all guys could be like him.

02:30.608 --> 02:31.984
I know.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.783
Are there no conscious men
in the city for you two?

02:40.618 --> 02:44.204
- He doesn't have anyone.
- Yeah. We feel kind of responsible.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.499
I can't believe you said, "Woo-hoo."

02:48.084 --> 02:49.585
I don't even say, "Woo-hoo."

02:49.752 --> 02:51.461
Oh, she's coming up. She's coming up.

02:51.629 --> 02:52.671
Folks, when we come back...

02:52.839 --> 02:54.882
...we'll talk about her new book
Euphoria Unbound...

02:55.049 --> 02:58.677
...with always-interesting Nora Tyler Bing.
Put the kids to bed for this one.

02:58.845 --> 03:02.472
Don't watch this. Weekend at Bernie's
is on Showtime and HBO and Cinemex.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.684
- No way.
- Come on. She's your mom.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.936
Exactly. Weekend at Bernie's.

03:08.104 --> 03:10.731
Dead guy getting hit
in the groin 20, 30 times.

03:12.108 --> 03:13.567
- No?
- Chandler, I gotta tell you...

03:13.735 --> 03:16.153
...I love your mom's books.
I love her books.

03:16.321 --> 03:19.156
I cannot get on a plane without one.
I mean, this is so cool.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.283
You wouldn't think it's cool
if you were 11...

03:21.451 --> 03:25.704
...and all your friends were passing around
page 79 of Mistress Bitch.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.874
Come on, Chandler. I love your mom.
I think she's a blast.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.085
- You can say that. She's not your mom.
- Oh, please. She's the...

03:32.253 --> 03:34.588
Hi, sweetie.

03:36.341 --> 03:39.134
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?

03:40.637 --> 03:42.012
- Last night.
- Really?

03:42.180 --> 03:45.474
So then his plane didn't explode
in a big ball of fire?

03:45.642 --> 03:47.601
Just a dream I had.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.561
But, phew.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.314
Hey, hey, hey. She's on.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.568
Ah. Nora Bing.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.071
Before we get to the book.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.366
What is this about you being arrested
in London? What is that about?

04:02.742 --> 04:06.954
- Your mom was arrested?
- Shh, I'm busy beaming with pride.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.122
This is kind of embarrassing...

04:09.290 --> 04:13.502
...but occasionally after
I've been intimate with a man...

04:13.962 --> 04:16.964
- Why would she say that's embarrassing?
- Shh.

04:17.173 --> 04:20.550
- I just get this craving
for Kung Pao chicken.

04:20.718 --> 04:23.178
That's too much information.

04:26.724 --> 04:29.476
So now you're doing this book tour thing.
How's that going?

04:29.644 --> 04:33.730
Oh, fine. I'm leaving
for New York tomorrow, which I hate.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.149
But I get to see my son, who I love.

04:36.317 --> 04:37.776
Oh.

04:37.986 --> 04:41.863
This is the way that I find out.
Most moms use the phone.

04:42.031 --> 04:46.034
You know, don't take this wrong,
I just don't see you as a mom somehow.

04:46.202 --> 04:50.163
- I don't mean that bad.
- Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.791
I bought my son his first condoms.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.174
And then he burst into flames.

05:10.268 --> 05:14.146
Let's see. "Congress is
debating a new deficit-reduction bill.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.606
The mayor wants to raise
subway fares again.

05:17.191 --> 05:19.401
The high today was 45."

05:19.569 --> 05:21.695
And, oh. And teams played sports.

05:49.098 --> 05:51.016
- What about Glen?
- No.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.227
- He could be a Glen.
- Mm-mm. Not special enough.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.855
Ooh, how about Agamemnon?

05:57.023 --> 05:58.940
Way too special.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.743
I'm famished. What do I want?

06:09.911 --> 06:13.246
Please, God, don't let it be
Kung Pao chicken.

06:13.414 --> 06:16.333
Oh, you watched the show.
What did you think?

06:16.501 --> 06:19.628
Well, I think you need
to come out of your shell just...

06:22.048 --> 06:23.632
What is this dive?

06:23.800 --> 06:26.802
- Only you could've picked this place.
- Oh.

06:26.969 --> 06:28.345
Come on. Shut up. It's fun.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.013
- Hi.
- Give me a hug.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.975
- Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
- I know I am.

06:34.143 --> 06:35.727
- Who's doing shots?
- Hit me.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.562
- I'm in.
- There you go. Ross?

06:37.730 --> 06:40.649
Uh, I'm not really a shot-drinking
kind of guy.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.526
Hi. Sorry. Sorry we're late.

06:42.693 --> 06:46.321
We, uh, kind of just, you know,
lost track of time.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.659
But a man can change.

06:56.207 --> 06:58.834
Anyone want me to appraise anything?

07:08.928 --> 07:12.180
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you,
I've read everything you've ever written.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.558
No, I mean it.
When I read Euphoria at Midnight...

07:14.725 --> 07:16.476
...all I wanted to do was become a writer.

07:16.644 --> 07:19.479
Oh, please, honey.
If I can do it, anybody can.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.357
You just start with half a dozen
European cities...

07:22.525 --> 07:24.985
...throw in 30 euphemisms
for male genitalia...

07:25.153 --> 07:27.863
...and, bam, you have got yourself
a book.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.575
My mother, ladies and gentlemen.

07:34.579 --> 07:37.706
Yeah, any messages for room 226?

07:38.958 --> 07:42.252
- You okay, slugger?
- Oh, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.600
What is with you tonight?

07:56.767 --> 07:59.728
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.938
Okay, thank you.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.527
It's the Italian hand-licker, isn't it?

08:07.737 --> 08:10.572
No. It's the one he's licking.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.158
She's supposed to be with you.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.368
You're good.

08:16.204 --> 08:20.165
Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold
100 million copies of my books...

08:20.333 --> 08:21.458
...and you know why?

08:21.626 --> 08:23.585
The girl on the cover
with her nipples showing?

08:26.422 --> 08:31.426
No, because I know how to write men
that women fall in love with.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.595
Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo.

08:33.763 --> 08:37.057
People will not turn 325 pages
for a Paolo.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.975
Come on.
The guy's a secondary character.

08:39.143 --> 08:42.979
He's just a... You know, a complication
you eventually kill off.

08:45.149 --> 08:46.525
When?

08:48.653 --> 08:51.363
He's not a hero.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.198
You know who our hero is?

08:53.533 --> 08:56.076
The guy on the cover
with his nipples showing?

08:56.786 --> 08:58.411
No, it's you.

08:58.579 --> 09:00.205
- Please.
- No, really.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.582
Come on. You're smart. You're sexy.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.168
- Right.
- Oh, come on, kiddo.

09:05.336 --> 09:08.004
You're gonna be fine, believe me.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.010
Uh-oh.

09:26.315 --> 09:29.734
Uh, I'll just pee in the street.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.288
Is Chandler here?

09:41.455 --> 09:43.373
- Yeah.
- Wait. Come here.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.418
Okay, uh, about last night...

09:46.586 --> 09:48.169
...um, you know...

09:48.337 --> 09:50.297
...Chandler. You didn't tell...

09:50.506 --> 09:52.507
Okay, I'm thinking
we don't need to tell Chandler.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.968
It was just a kiss. One kiss.
No big deal, right?

09:55.136 --> 09:57.053
- Right. No big deal.
- Okay.

09:57.221 --> 09:58.930
In Bizarro-world.

10:02.351 --> 10:03.560
You broke the code.

10:03.728 --> 10:06.688
- What code?
- You don't kiss your friend's mom.

10:06.856 --> 10:10.525
Sisters are okay.
Maybe a hot-looking aunt.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.694
But not a mom. Never a mom.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.657
What are you guys doing out here?

10:17.825 --> 10:21.703
Uh, well, Joey and I had discussed getting
in an early morning racquetball game.

10:23.164 --> 10:26.249
But, um,
apparently somebody overslept.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.128
Yeah, well, you don't have your racquet.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.422
No. No, I don't,
because it's being restrung.

10:32.590 --> 10:35.383
Ahem. Somebody was supposed
to bring me one.

10:35.801 --> 10:39.346
Yeah. Well, you didn't call
and leave your grip size.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.809
Okay, you guys are spending
way too much time together.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.356
Okay, I'm scum. I'm scum.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.983
- Ross, how could you let this happen?
- I don't know.

10:52.151 --> 10:56.196
Well, it's not like she's a regular mom.
You know? She's sexy. She's...

10:56.364 --> 10:58.490
You don't think my mom's sexy?

10:59.909 --> 11:02.535
Well, not in the same way.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.621
I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani...

11:04.789 --> 11:06.748
...was a handsome woman in her day,
all right?

11:08.084 --> 11:11.294
You think it's easy giving birth
to seven children?

11:11.462 --> 11:12.754
Huh?

11:13.381 --> 11:16.466
Okay, I think we're getting
into a weird area here.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.343
- Aah.
- Hey.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.136
- Hey.
- What are you guys doing out here?

11:20.304 --> 11:23.473
Well, ha, ha, not playing racquetball.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.687
- He forgot to leave his grip size.
- He didn't get the goggles.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.689
Oh. Right.

11:30.856 --> 11:34.526
Well, sounds like you two have issues.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.238
Goodbye, baby.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.535
Do they wait for me to do this?

11:49.375 --> 11:51.543
- So are you gonna tell him?
- I'm not gonna tell him.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.962
- Why would I tell him?
- How about, because if you don't...

11:54.130 --> 11:56.256
...his mother might?
- Hmm.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.550
What are you guys doing here?

11:58.718 --> 12:01.845
Uh, he's not even wearing a jock strap.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.269
What did I ask?

12:19.905 --> 12:22.449
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.452
What are you doing here?

12:25.619 --> 12:28.455
Nothing. I just thought
I'd stop by, you know, after the, ahem...

12:28.622 --> 12:31.332
That I, you know.
Um, so, what are you doing here?

12:33.335 --> 12:35.170
I'm not really here.

12:35.337 --> 12:39.966
I just thought I'd drop these off
on the way. My way.

12:42.344 --> 12:45.555
Do you, um, come here a lot...

12:46.015 --> 12:47.265
...without me?

12:47.433 --> 12:50.226
No, no, no.

12:52.855 --> 12:56.191
So, um, do you think he's doing any better
than he was this morning?

12:57.777 --> 13:00.320
How would I know? I wasn't here.

13:00.488 --> 13:03.948
Really? Not even to,
um, change his pajamas?

13:07.661 --> 13:08.828
Oh, my God.

13:08.996 --> 13:11.873
You're my friend. I had to tell you.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.792
I can't believe it.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.044
Paolo kissed my mom?

13:17.588 --> 13:20.673
Yeah, I mean, I don't know if you noticed,
but he had a lot to drink.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.510
I mean, you know how he gets
when he's drunk...

13:25.304 --> 13:27.263
I can't do this. I did it.

13:27.431 --> 13:29.974
It was me. I'm sorry. I kissed your mom.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.768
What?

13:31.936 --> 13:35.480
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo
and I think I had too much tequila...

13:35.648 --> 13:38.775
...and Nora... Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was...

13:40.736 --> 13:43.154
She was just being nice, you know?
But nothing happened.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.949
Nothing. Ask Joey. Joey came in...

13:46.116 --> 13:47.826
- You knew about this?
- Uh...

13:47.993 --> 13:50.203
You know, knowledge is a tricky thing.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.957
I spent the entire day with you.
Why didn't you tell me?

13:54.124 --> 13:56.251
Hey, hey. You're lucky
I caught them when I did...

13:56.418 --> 13:58.169
...or else who knows
what would've happened?

13:58.337 --> 13:59.838
Thanks, man. Big help.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.465
I can't believe this.
What the hell were you thinking?

14:02.633 --> 14:04.759
I wasn't. I don't know. I...

14:04.927 --> 14:08.263
Of all my friends, no one knows the crap
I go through with my mom more than you.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.765
- I know.
- I can't believe you did this.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.226
- Me neither.
- I'm mad at you for not telling me.

14:13.394 --> 14:16.771
- What are you mad at me...?
- Let me slam the door.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.357
Chandler, I didn't kiss her. He did.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.150
See what happens
when you break the code?

14:21.318 --> 14:23.194
- Joey.
- Aah! Uh.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.706
- Rach.
- Hey.

14:34.874 --> 14:38.042
"A Woman Undone.
By Rachel Karen Green."

14:38.210 --> 14:41.629
Yeah, I thought I'd give it a shot.
I'm still on the first chapter.

14:41.797 --> 14:46.968
Now, do you think his "love stick"
can be "liberated from its denim prison"?

14:48.470 --> 14:50.722
Yeah, I'd say so.

14:50.890 --> 14:54.142
And there's no "J" in "engorged."

14:55.519 --> 14:57.186
- Hey, Rach.
- Hey.

14:57.354 --> 14:59.105
- Hello.
- Hello.

14:59.648 --> 15:02.275
- You going to the hospital tonight?
- No. You?

15:02.693 --> 15:04.110
No. You?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.656
You just asked me.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.909
Okay, maybe it was a trick question.

15:12.161 --> 15:15.872
- Um, Rachel, can we do this now?
- Okay.

15:16.832 --> 15:19.250
I am so hot.

15:20.419 --> 15:23.504
And here's a picture of my mother
and father on their wedding day.

15:23.672 --> 15:26.507
Now, you tell me she's not a knockout.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.053
I cannot believe
we're having this conversation.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.805
Come on, just try to picture her
not pregnant. That's all.

15:34.892 --> 15:38.394
Central Perk is proud to present
Miss Phoebe Buffay.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.773
Thanks.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.691
Hi. Um, ahem. Okay.

15:43.901 --> 15:47.195
I'd like to start with a song
that's about a man I recently met...

15:47.363 --> 15:50.573
...who's, um, come to be
very important to me.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.202
Okay.

15:56.914 --> 16:00.667
You don't have to be awake
To be my man

16:02.836 --> 16:07.882
Long as you have brain waves
I'll be there to hold your hand

16:09.176 --> 16:11.719
Though we just met the other day

16:11.887 --> 16:15.181
There's something I have got to say

16:16.266 --> 16:19.310
Okay, thank you very much.
I'm gonna take a short break.

16:21.689 --> 16:25.233
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay,
everybody. Whoo!

16:26.443 --> 16:29.195
- What the hell was that?
- Phoebe just started...

16:29.363 --> 16:32.991
I believe I was talking to Joey.
All right, there, mother-kisser?

16:38.372 --> 16:40.123
"Mother-kisser."

16:41.458 --> 16:42.792
I'll shut up.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.586
Chandler, can I say something?
I know you're still mad at me.

16:45.754 --> 16:48.965
I just wanna say that there were
two people there that night, okay?

16:49.133 --> 16:52.051
- There were two sets of lips.
- Yes, well, I expect this from her.

16:52.219 --> 16:54.971
Okay? She's always been
a Freudian nightmare.

16:55.139 --> 16:58.349
Okay, but if she always behaves like this,
why don't you say something?

16:58.517 --> 17:01.394
Because it's complicated. It's complex.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.229
Hey, you kissed my mom.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.444
We're rehearsing a Greek play.

17:10.779 --> 17:12.571
- That's funny. We done now?
- No.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.992
Okay, you mean you're not gonna
talk to her, tell her how you feel?

17:16.160 --> 17:19.454
That would be a no. Just because
you played tonsil tennis with my mom...

17:19.621 --> 17:22.832
...doesn't mean you know her, all right?
Trust me, you can't talk to her.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.376
Okay. "You can't"? Or you can't?

17:26.627 --> 17:30.965
Okay, that's my finger.
Okay, that's my knee.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.925
Still doing the play.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.769
All right, what did you do with him?

17:47.024 --> 17:48.941
- You're awake.
- Look at you.

17:49.109 --> 17:50.109
How do you feel?

17:50.277 --> 17:53.362
Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.573
Gosh, you look good.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.533
I feel good.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.911
Who are you?

18:00.079 --> 18:01.746
- Sorry.
- I'm Phoebe Buffay.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.499
I'm Monica Geller.
I've been taking care of you.

18:04.666 --> 18:05.666
We both have.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.836
- So the Etch A Sketch is from you guys?
- Actually, it's just from me.

18:09.004 --> 18:11.923
- Yeah, I got you the foot massager.
- Know who shaved you? That was me.

18:12.091 --> 18:15.009
- I read to you.
- I sang. Ha.

18:16.553 --> 18:17.970
Well, thanks.

18:18.138 --> 18:20.389
- Oh, my pleasure.
- You're welcome.

18:20.557 --> 18:23.518
So I guess I'll see you around.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.354
What? That's it?

18:27.064 --> 18:28.606
"See you around"?

18:28.774 --> 18:32.068
- Well, what do you want me to say?
- Well, I don't know.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.569
Maybe, uh:

18:33.821 --> 18:35.113
"That was nice.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.739
It meant something to me.

18:37.991 --> 18:39.867
I'll call you."

18:40.577 --> 18:44.038
- All right. I'll call you.
- I don't think you mean that.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.377
This is so typical.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.670
You know, we give...

18:50.838 --> 18:52.296
...and we give...

18:52.464 --> 18:54.006
...and we give.

18:54.174 --> 18:56.467
And then we just get nothing back.

18:56.635 --> 19:00.471
And then one day, it's just, you know,
you wake up and "See you around."

19:02.808 --> 19:04.559
Let's go, Phoebe.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.896
You know what?
We thought you were different.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.357
But I guess it was just the coma.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.613
The car's running downstairs.

19:17.781 --> 19:20.241
I wanted to drop off these copies
of my book for your friends.

19:21.201 --> 19:25.580
- Anything you want from Lisbon?
- No, just knowing you're there is enough.

19:26.206 --> 19:29.834
All right. Well, be good. I love you.

19:32.546 --> 19:34.130
You kissed my best Ross.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.551
Or something to that effect.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.846
Okay.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.643
Look, it was stupid.

19:47.811 --> 19:50.188
- Really stupid.
- Really stupid.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.692
And I don't even know how it happened.

19:54.860 --> 19:58.738
I'm sorry, honey.
I promise it will never happen again.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.034
- Are we okay now?
- Yeah.

20:03.785 --> 20:06.495
No. No.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.960
Ah, the forbidden love
of a man and his door.

20:13.128 --> 20:14.378
Shh.

20:15.172 --> 20:18.466
He did it. He told her off. And not just
about the kiss, about everything.

20:18.634 --> 20:19.675
- You're kidding?
- No.

20:19.843 --> 20:22.511
He said, "When are you gonna
grow up and start being a mom?"

20:22.679 --> 20:24.764
- Wow.
- Wait, then she came back with:

20:24.973 --> 20:29.477
"The question is, when are you gonna
grow up and realize I have a bomb?"

20:31.480 --> 20:33.105
Okay, wait. Are you sure she didn't say:

20:33.273 --> 20:37.109
"When are you gonna grow up
and realize I am your mom?"

20:40.739 --> 20:42.823
- That makes more sense.
- You think?

20:42.991 --> 20:44.533
Yeah.

20:45.285 --> 20:46.786
So, what's going on now?

20:46.954 --> 20:49.997
I don't know. I've been standing here
spelling it out for you.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.335
I don't hear anything. Wait, wait, wait.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.711
What do you see?

20:55.879 --> 20:58.297
It's hard to tell.
They're so tiny and upside down.

20:58.465 --> 20:59.799
Wait, wait, wait.

20:59.967 --> 21:03.386
They're walking away.
They're walking away.

21:03.553 --> 21:06.973
No, they're not. They're coming
right at us. Run, run!

21:09.685 --> 21:10.810
You okay, kiddo?

21:10.978 --> 21:14.230
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- All right. You be good.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.148
Drive safe.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.778
- Mrs. Bing.
- Mr. Geller.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.201
Hey.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.621
You mean that?

21:31.373 --> 21:33.457
Yeah, why not?

21:35.168 --> 21:36.877
- So I told her.
- Oh.

21:37.587 --> 21:39.588
- How did it go?
- Awful. Awful.

21:39.756 --> 21:41.674
Couldn't have gone worse.

21:42.426 --> 21:45.261
- Well, how do you feel?
- Pretty good.

21:47.347 --> 21:48.848
I told her.

21:49.016 --> 21:51.017
Well, see?

21:51.184 --> 21:55.354
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea,
you know, me kissing your mom, huh?

21:55.522 --> 21:58.024
But we don't have to go down that road.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.657
Now, this is just the first chapter...

22:06.825 --> 22:11.954
...and I want your absolute
honest opinion. Okay?

22:12.205 --> 22:16.834
Oh, and on page two, he's not reaching
for her "heaving beasts."

22:17.878 --> 22:18.961
What's a "niffle"?

22:19.212 --> 22:22.131
You can usually find them
on the heaving beasts.

22:24.259 --> 22:26.510
All right, all right,
so I'm not a great typist.

22:26.678 --> 22:30.723
Wait, did you get to the part
about his "huge, throbbing pens"?

22:31.558 --> 22:34.810
Tell you, you don't wanna be around
when he starts writing with those.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.105
- All right, that's it. Give them back.
- No.
