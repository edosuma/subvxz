- The CB, Cotton Mouth.

for doing 75. (Chuckles)

But, uh... just for the sake of agreement
and old times,

11:14.840 --> 11:18.760
let's just say you were doing,
uh... 70?

11:19.470 --> 11:23.264
- Which could come to about, uh...
- (Spider Mike)... about 35.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.059
Plus the insurance
goes up another 100.

11:30.147 --> 11:32.023
Might be just a bit more than that.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.942

11:34.068 --> 11:37.153

wanna take your chances in court,

11:37.279 --> 11:40.115
hell, I got me a real nice jail.

and they'll just sit there.

- How much is it, Lyle?
- 50.

Yeah, well, you keep it safe
in a ditch somewhere, feeding flies.

- 70!
- My ass!

any more of them raises, y'all.

are gonna be organising the cops.

12:27.163 --> 12:30.915

of your damn union.

They ain't my damn union, Lyle.
I'm independent, remember?

12:37.173 --> 12:39.466

one thing in common.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.426

- Yeah.

If my cab doesn't show up,
I'll sure think about it.

14:03.551 --> 14:06.261
- 2,000. I'm sorry it couldn't be more.
- I wouldn't. He's a lotta trouble.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.304
But that thing out there
needs a total rewire.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.473
- This is gorgeous.
- Here, you should have this.

- (Melissa) It'll be great with your hair.
- (Mechanic) I gotta buy foreign parts...

give this away if I was you.

I'm taking a hell of a beating.

my driver's licence or nothing?

Who wants it?

14:34.790 --> 14:36.124
I'll take it.

14:36.584 --> 14:37.750
How much?

14:37.877 --> 14:39.294
- $5.
- Ten.

- 12.
- 15.

- Oh, Melissa, this is the Duck.

15:52.993 --> 15:54.702
She needs a ride.

15:54.828 --> 15:57.872
- What happened to the XKE?
- I sold it.

15:57.998 --> 15:59.958
How do you two know each other?

16:00.084 --> 16:02.210
This is the guy I told you about.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.963
The one that told the cop
that I was nude driving.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.924
- Oh, I should've known.
- He get you?

16:08.050 --> 16:11.302
Well, after his proposition,
I sent him to the motel of his choice

16:11.428 --> 16:13.554
where I think he's probably
still waiting for me.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.473
(Laughing)

16:18.686 --> 16:21.980
- Did you ever ride in a truck?
- No.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.358
Do you want to?

16:26.568 --> 16:27.694
Maybe.

16:31.782 --> 16:34.909
Come on, honey, I got a little
birthday surprise for you.

16:35.035 --> 16:37.704
I bet you do.
Don't you leave without me.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.498
- You ain't mad at me, are you?
- Me mad at you?

16:40.624 --> 16:43.042
- Watch me.
- Watch how I handle this.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.294
Come on.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.922
- That's my ride?
- That's it, honey.

16:48.507 --> 16:51.426
Come on, baby,
don't be like that.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.636
You know
my heart belongs to you, Violet.

16:53.762 --> 16:56.764
Oh, yeah, sure,
for about one hot second.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.058
Hey, well,
that's not my fault, is it now?

16:59.184 --> 17:01.102
When are you gonna get rid
of that sorry old man of yours?

17:01.228 --> 17:05.231
He's not so sorry. He's just had
a little hard luck, that's all.

17:06.233 --> 17:09.152
Yeah, and I'm looking
at the very worst part of it, ain't I?

17:09.278 --> 17:11.112
(Chuckles)

17:13.490 --> 17:16.576
- My handle's Love Machine.
- (Spider Mike) No! Uh-uh!

17:17.202 --> 17:19.244
Miss, his name is Pig Pen.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.789
That's temporary.

17:27.713 --> 17:31.382
No, you just wait right there.
I'll let you know when you can come in.

17:31.508 --> 17:34.177
I hear you're looking for a ride,
a nice lady like you.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.804
She already has one with the Duck.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.765
Thank you, anyway.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.601
I'll take your bags to the truck then.

17:41.727 --> 17:45.438
Oh, Pig Pen, uh...
excuse me, Love Machine.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.566
Just, it's his birthday, honey.
Give him a break.

17:48.692 --> 17:50.860
- Come on, let's go have that salad.
- Allow me.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.820
Thank you.

17:53.947 --> 17:57.867
- I think she likes me.
- Yeah, it's obvious, man(!)

18:01.622 --> 18:04.373
(Violet) OK, it's ready.
You can come in now.

18:20.349 --> 18:23.226
Help me unwrap the present?

18:36.323 --> 18:37.573
What am I supposed to do?

18:53.757 --> 18:55.591
Hey, Pig Pen, look outside, man.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.345
What do you think
that fat slob is up to?

18:59.471 --> 19:00.847
Checking plates, I imagine.

19:00.973 --> 19:04.934
Ooh, come here. Watch what I do here.
Hey, Mike, come here.

19:05.060 --> 19:07.937
- Man, I'm always game for some fun.
- What is he doing?

19:08.063 --> 19:10.022
Mmm, never mess with a cop.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.484
How did you know
it was my birthday, anyway?

19:13.610 --> 19:15.570
I know a lot of things about you.

19:16.446 --> 19:18.072
- You do, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

19:18.198 --> 19:19.490
(Love Machine)
'Breaker, can you hear me? '

19:19.616 --> 19:21.784
Anybody? Over.
Say yeah.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.619
(Spider Mike) 'Yeah, I hear you.'

19:23.745 --> 19:26.289
'There's a cop cruising along,
checking plates.'

19:26.874 --> 19:29.792
You know who that damn bear is?
That's dirty Lyle.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.878
'Ain't he a heavy mother, though? '

19:32.713 --> 19:34.589
'Hey man, Boulder Belly isn't heavy.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.258
'Boulder Belly is fat.
There's a big difference.'

19:38.343 --> 19:40.970
Watch when he gets outta the car
and starts bouncing around.

19:41.096 --> 19:43.848
Looks like a beach ball a little bit.
Turkey face.

19:44.641 --> 19:47.226
'He bounces like a quasi-beaver.'

19:48.854 --> 19:50.813
(Spider Mike) 'I'll be damned.
I should have known.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.858
'That's probably why
he stoops so low to get cash.

19:53.984 --> 19:56.986
'He's saving
for one of those sex operations.'

19:57.112 --> 19:59.071
(Crockery rattling)

20:01.575 --> 20:03.034
Hey, here he comes, guys.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.954
(Love Machine) 'Very nice talkin' to you,
good buddy.'

20:07.080 --> 20:09.582
- 'My pleasure.'
- 'Over and out.'

20:22.095 --> 20:23.429
(Horn blares)

20:27.309 --> 20:29.268
Here.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.872
(Sniffles)

20:54.169 --> 20:55.253
Hey, Duck.

20:57.881 --> 20:59.423
Duck!

21:09.810 --> 21:11.686
Where's the Duck?

21:12.980 --> 21:14.021
What Duck?

21:19.152 --> 21:20.611
(Chuckles)

21:27.828 --> 21:29.412
(Black Widow) Duck!

21:29.538 --> 21:31.664
'We got Lyle in here,
man, and uh... '

21:31.790 --> 21:34.834
and he's got pain
written all over his face.

21:43.051 --> 21:45.428
Pig Pen. (Chuckles)

21:48.098 --> 21:50.683
How much cash
you got in your pocket?

21:52.811 --> 21:55.438
I still got enough, thank you.

21:57.190 --> 22:00.901
Duck, I don't know what you're doing,
but you'd better get your ass in here.

22:01.028 --> 22:03.696
Hey, baby, I'm sorry.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.031
I gotta go.

22:11.371 --> 22:12.788
Hey, boy.

22:13.749 --> 22:17.168
- (Lyle) 'How are you fixed? '
- Son of a bitch!

22:18.837 --> 22:20.713
Sorry, man,
but I don't have nothing.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.341
- You know that.
- Mmm-hmm. (Chuckles)

22:24.593 --> 22:27.094
Well, in that case then,
young fella,

22:27.220 --> 22:29.180
I'm just gonna have to
arrest you for vagrancy.

22:31.683 --> 22:34.727
Stand up
and lean against that counter.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.103
(Shouts) I said stand up!

22:38.148 --> 22:40.941
- You heard me. Get up!
- (Duck) Hey, hey, hey, hey.

22:41.068 --> 22:44.612
Thanks, friends. You all sure know
how to mess up a birthday party, man.

22:44.738 --> 22:48.491
It's late now, so let's just be
getting out of here. You too, darling.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.618
Go get your things.
I'm so sorry about...

22:50.744 --> 22:52.953
Hold it! Hold it!

22:53.997 --> 22:56.999
Hey, come on, man.
They ain't breaking no law.

22:57.125 --> 22:58.584
What's the matter?

22:58.710 --> 23:02.338
Your boy is going crazy, man.

23:02.464 --> 23:05.257
He's trying to bust me
on some bullshit vagrancy charge.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.886
- And I'm not going to no goddamn jail.
- Oh?

23:09.763 --> 23:12.932
My old lady's having a baby, man.
I gotta get home.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.433
- Oh...
- It's the truth, Lyle.

23:14.559 --> 23:17.895
She's over nine months gone, man,
and she's about to drop.

23:27.656 --> 23:30.241
Anybody know who the father is?

23:33.912 --> 23:35.830
Now, get over there.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.875
(Spider Mike) You fat bastard!

23:40.001 --> 23:42.294
Let me go! I want to take that!

23:42.421 --> 23:43.546
You, son of a...

23:48.677 --> 23:49.969
Dammit!

23:52.639 --> 23:54.140
Well, you blew Arizona.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.566
You all better get to your trucks.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.026
Yeah, you, too.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.528
Yeah.

24:10.866 --> 24:11.907
(Cop) All right, freeze!

24:12.033 --> 24:14.702
We got real trouble now, man.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.912
Stand aside.

24:17.038 --> 24:19.540
- I waited for you.
- My car broke down.

24:23.503 --> 24:25.129
Excuse me, please.

24:25.255 --> 24:26.881
- Get back!
- Hey!

24:30.343 --> 24:32.136
- Hey!
- Oooh!

24:33.263 --> 24:34.638
Wait.

24:34.764 --> 24:35.806
(Grunting)

24:38.310 --> 24:40.144
Ooooh!

24:43.106 --> 24:44.648
Runyon!

24:48.612 --> 24:50.237
(Moaning)
Ooooh!

24:51.281 --> 24:53.365
Did you see that?

24:53.492 --> 24:54.533
Put it on their bill.

25:02.250 --> 25:03.792
Let's break this up!

25:19.809 --> 25:21.727
I just redecorated last month.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.812
- (Indistinct chatter)
- Come on, get him!

25:23.939 --> 25:25.564
Hit him! Hit him!

25:34.574 --> 25:36.867
I don't have to work
under these circumstances.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.288
I own the place!

25:41.414 --> 25:43.916
(Pig Pen) Get those kids out of here!
Come on!

25:44.042 --> 25:46.919
- Hey, Widow, you OK?
- I'll make it.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.171
- Get him, Pack.
- I'll get him when I'm ready, White!

25:51.591 --> 25:54.635
(Spider Mike) You overgrown
son of a bitch! I'll beat your ass!

25:54.761 --> 25:56.303
Now, Pack, bust him!

25:56.429 --> 25:57.638
Damn you! Get back!

26:02.978 --> 26:04.520
Ow!

26:04.646 --> 26:05.729
Get him!

26:19.077 --> 26:20.995
I got him, Pack!

26:41.683 --> 26:44.393
I'll eat your ears off,
you big son of a bitch!

27:04.789 --> 27:06.957
- Come on.
- That ain't no cop.

27:07.083 --> 27:10.002
- That's a mule wearing a uniform.
- Hell of a fight, Duck.

27:10.128 --> 27:11.712
(Panting) Thanks.

27:17.552 --> 27:21.430
Gimme a hand here. Come on, Pack,
don't waste no time.

27:28.980 --> 27:32.024
Come on, let's hit it.
Let's go!

27:34.402 --> 27:38.447
Kick the sucker in. Go on! Get it!
You can do it, Pig Pen!

27:38.573 --> 27:42.660
Hey, Bobby! You'd do better
yankin' the wires on that thing.

27:47.123 --> 27:49.208
All right! Let's get the other wires.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.585
Open up, that.

27:51.711 --> 27:54.088
- Pull them suckers out!
- Get them plug wires.

27:54.214 --> 27:55.673
Come on! Tear 'em out.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.549
(Grunting)
They ain't going nowhere in this one!

27:57.676 --> 28:00.219
- (Black Widow) Hey, come on, man!
- Get that distributor outta there.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.596
Get the whole damn mess.
Let's take it all with us.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.765
Let's get it all. Let's go.

28:09.270 --> 28:12.398
- Where you goin'?
- State line.

28:15.151 --> 28:16.443
Yeah, why the hell not?

28:17.237 --> 28:19.196
- We goin' with 'em?
- Let's go.

28:19.322 --> 28:22.700
- Let's go!
- (Cheering)

28:22.826 --> 28:24.326
Let's get the hell out of here!

28:24.452 --> 28:26.870
Let's go! Move 'em out!

28:54.107 --> 28:55.482
Happy birthday.

29:00.530 --> 29:01.780
Take care.

29:15.628 --> 29:18.505
(Engines revving)

29:22.510 --> 29:27.097
(Horns honking)

29:53.625 --> 29:57.294
(Lyle) Don't just stand here like a bunch
of dummies! See if you can find my gun!

29:57.420 --> 30:00.506
- If I get you out on the road...
- (Violet) Here it is!

30:00.632 --> 30:02.466
(Lyle) "Here it is!" Bring it over here!

30:04.385 --> 30:06.053
Jesus Christ!

30:06.679 --> 30:09.890
Where the Hell have you been? Come on!
Help me get the hell out of here!

30:10.809 --> 30:14.019
See if you can get a hacksaw, anything!
You son of a b...

30:14.896 --> 30:16.980
(Waitress) I got it - a nail file!

30:17.106 --> 30:21.693
Uh? A nail file? Well, you know
what you can do with your nail file!

30:24.405 --> 30:26.073
(Gun shot)

30:26.199 --> 30:27.282
Oh wait, wait!

30:28.451 --> 30:29.743
Wait!

30:30.578 --> 30:33.288
(Grunting)

30:53.935 --> 30:57.062
- I'll talk to you later.
- OK.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.608
- Hey, come on!
- Get out of here, you dumb...

31:07.240 --> 31:10.534
Any one of you jerks got a car?
You got any keys?

31:10.660 --> 31:13.036
Don't just stand there!
Come on, will ya?

31:13.162 --> 31:14.538
Hey!

31:14.664 --> 31:16.665
Hey, hold it, will ya?

31:16.791 --> 31:19.710
- Let's get rid of that stuff!
- Hey, I need your car!

31:21.004 --> 31:22.880
I'm commandeering your car.

31:23.548 --> 31:26.174
Hey kid I'm sorry, I'm...
What are you doing?

31:26.801 --> 31:29.052
- Nothing, officer.
- What do you mean, "nothing"?

31:29.178 --> 31:32.973
What's that you got in your mouth?
What are you kids chewing on?

31:33.099 --> 31:35.726
Get the hell out of there!
Get the hell out of here!

31:36.477 --> 31:37.853
Get out of here!

31:37.979 --> 31:39.146
Go on, get out of there!

31:39.814 --> 31:42.399
Get the hell out of here!

31:42.942 --> 31:45.819
I'll be back after your ass!
(Engine starting)

31:45.945 --> 31:47.446
(Engine revving)

32:00.501 --> 32:03.337
(Pig Pen) 'Breaker, breaker.
How's that nose of yours, Duck?

32:03.463 --> 32:06.173
'It sure was pushing
that cop around.'

32:07.050 --> 32:10.427
Yeah, I got a kind of slow start there.
I don't think it's broke, though.

32:10.553 --> 32:13.555
(Spider Mike) 'Hey, Duck, we was
just getting wound up, weren't we? '

32:13.681 --> 32:15.849
(Duck) 'We were just fixin'
to bother him to death,

32:15.975 --> 32:18.477
'till the Widow Woman
kicked his lights out.'

32:18.603 --> 32:21.396
You'd better move your ass.
(Laughing)

32:22.732 --> 32:23.899
How we travellin', Duck?

32:24.025 --> 32:26.902
'We're gonna get a certain amount
of attention real soon.'

32:27.028 --> 32:28.904
(Duck) 'Remember that old road
we used to use

32:29.030 --> 32:30.822
'when we was working with Sharkey?

32:30.949 --> 32:33.450
'There's just about room enough
on it for us, man.

32:33.576 --> 32:36.328
'I think it'll give us a clean shot
to the state line.'

32:36.454 --> 32:38.705
You got the White Rat here.
I think ol' Pack can handle that.

32:38.831 --> 32:42.042
- 'All right, Duck. 10-4.'
- 'You got the Lizard Tongue here.

32:42.168 --> 32:46.129
- 'Who have we got with us? '
- 'Old Iguana here!

32:46.255 --> 32:48.757
'I'm a lecherous old lizard
with love on my mind! '

32:55.890 --> 32:58.183
(Melissa) I'm supposed to catch a plane
to Dallas.

32:59.477 --> 33:02.396
- To do what?
- To photograph a wedding.

33:06.234 --> 33:10.237
Well, you're not gonna be catching
no plane for a while.

33:13.366 --> 33:14.700
(Lyle) Hey!
(Honking horn)

33:14.826 --> 33:16.910
Come on! Get out of there, will you?
Come on!

33:17.036 --> 33:18.662
Hey!
Where's your turning signal?

33:18.788 --> 33:22.874
(Honking horn) Where's your turn?
Get the hell out of the way!

33:23.001 --> 33:24.501
You dumb...

33:28.923 --> 33:31.925
Give me something to wipe
this shit off my face, will you?

33:39.225 --> 33:40.350
You want some coffee?

33:42.520 --> 33:43.478
Fuck.

33:44.522 --> 33:46.773
(Horn blaring)

33:48.026 --> 33:50.193
Good, cos we ain't got any, I forgot it.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.538
(Engine revving)

34:02.331 --> 34:04.291
'We're coming up
on a hard left here.'

34:04.417 --> 34:06.752
We'll be going through
a four-way intersection.

34:06.878 --> 34:09.295
OK.
(Honking horn)

34:13.217 --> 34:15.177
(Horns blaring)

34:23.226 --> 34:24.895
(Tyre blows)

34:41.204 --> 34:42.913
Let's get her out of there!

34:46.458 --> 34:49.878
- You all right, baby? Got your key off?
- I don't know, man!

34:50.963 --> 34:52.130
(Duck) Jesus.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.677
- Is she all right?
- Let me go and see.

34:59.222 --> 35:00.931
Just get my stuff, please.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.600
- You OK, miss?
- Yeah, I'm OK, I think.

35:04.143 --> 35:05.602
Goddam piece of white junk!

35:05.728 --> 35:07.687
I knew I should have bought myself
a black truck!

35:08.314 --> 35:09.856
Well, come on, let's haul ass!

35:09.982 --> 35:12.526
(Black Widow)
Y'all just got yourself a passenger!

35:19.492 --> 35:21.493
(Duck) 'Hey Widow, you all right? '

35:22.620 --> 35:24.204
'Yeah, I'm fine.
I got a bruised butt'

35:24.330 --> 35:25.997
and a black eye, but I'm OK.

35:27.041 --> 35:30.168
(Horn blaring)

35:33.047 --> 35:36.758
Oh! Holy jumpin'...

35:41.973 --> 35:44.766
That's one! That's one!

35:44.892 --> 35:46.893
Ah-ah! That's one!

35:47.019 --> 35:48.854
It's that crazy cop from Natosha.

36:12.628 --> 36:14.588
(Tyres screeching)

36:15.256 --> 36:17.757
Hey, get me one of those T-shirts,
will you?

36:20.720 --> 36:22.053
Aaaah!

36:23.764 --> 36:25.307
- Oooh!
- Watch it!

36:42.533 --> 36:44.618
(Chickens clucking)

36:47.622 --> 36:49.456
(Moaning)

36:49.582 --> 36:52.334
(Pack Rat) Holy Christ!
I swear that was Lyle Wallace!

36:54.295 --> 36:57.005
Lyle?

36:57.757 --> 37:01.134
Uh, Rubber Duck here.
Is that you back there, Lyle?

37:01.260 --> 37:03.470
You got your ears on, good buddy?

37:05.514 --> 37:07.015
(Coughing) I hear you.

37:09.644 --> 37:12.270
Are you OK?
You need a meat wagon or somethin'?

37:12.813 --> 37:13.730
(Panting)

37:13.856 --> 37:15.649
You'll need somethin' else,
you son of a bitch,

37:15.775 --> 37:17.609
once I get my hands on you!

37:18.486 --> 37:21.655
Hey, until you get a little better control
over that machinery,

37:21.781 --> 37:23.531
'I'd suggest you lay off them acrobatics.'

37:23.658 --> 37:27.410
Yeah, well, listen, I'm gonna have
the State Police in on this.

37:28.621 --> 37:33.333
And when we do, we're gonna lunch
on your ass, you son of a bitch!

37:33.459 --> 37:36.836
'Hey, I'm sorry, Lyle. You're coming in
real broken and garbled.'

37:37.797 --> 37:40.382
Uh, besides that,
you gotta catch us first, right?

37:42.426 --> 37:43.635
Ten years.

37:44.762 --> 37:48.556
I figure it at ten years, with a little
time off for good behaviour.

37:48.683 --> 37:53.520
This is Lyle Wallace,
Natosha County Sheriff's Office.

37:53.646 --> 37:54.771
Need assistance.

37:56.023 --> 38:00.068
(Siren blares)
'I'm down by the old farmhouse on 109.'

38:00.194 --> 38:01.444
Amen.

38:02.863 --> 38:05.448
Well, I think I've had about enough of this,
thank you very much.

38:05.574 --> 38:08.618
I think I'll just take my things
and get out.

38:10.997 --> 38:15.125
If you wanna pull over, I'm sure
I can hitch a ride very easily.

38:18.087 --> 38:19.129
OK, I'm ready.

38:21.424 --> 38:24.342
Weren't you listening to me?
I said I'm ready to get out!

38:26.137 --> 38:27.220
You want out?

38:30.016 --> 38:32.726
We're being chased.
If you want out, jump!

38:35.980 --> 38:38.023
Do you want to add the Mann Act
to your collection?

38:39.108 --> 38:41.026
Mann Act's for 18-year-olds.

38:41.152 --> 38:44.362
Not... someone who's seen
the best side of 30.

38:46.324 --> 38:50.076
(Sirens blaring)

38:51.620 --> 38:53.455
(Tyres screeching)

39:01.005 --> 39:03.506
(Groans)

39:09.889 --> 39:13.350
My name is Bob Bookman, sir,
and I hate truckers.

39:16.812 --> 39:21.691
Lyle Wallace, Sheriff's Office,
Natosha County.

39:26.655 --> 39:28.656
Ah, get your hands off me!

39:30.951 --> 39:35.080
It's around here somewhere.
It's an old back way into New Mexico.

39:40.878 --> 39:44.339
By God, here we are.
Get ready for a hard turn.

39:44.465 --> 39:47.050
(Sirens and horns)

40:06.112 --> 40:07.779
(Laughing)

40:15.454 --> 40:17.497
(Pack Rat) This ain't no damn road.
It's a trail!

40:17.623 --> 40:19.791
(White Rat)
Hell, it ain't even that.

40:19.917 --> 40:22.335
(Black Widow) Would you
do me a favour?

40:22.461 --> 40:25.797
(Choking) Would you roll up
that window, man?

40:25.923 --> 40:28.299
- The window's broke!
- Shit.

40:37.643 --> 40:39.894
(Melissa) I get it.
An invisible escape route.

40:40.020 --> 40:42.021
They'll never catch us now(!)

40:42.148 --> 40:43.815
Exactly.

40:43.941 --> 40:45.900
Now, here's the plan.

40:46.026 --> 40:49.112
When we get up to the pass,
we'll put on our fish costumes.

40:49.238 --> 40:53.700
I'll hand out the Vaseline and an extra
ration of rum for the men.

40:53.826 --> 40:55.702
That should do it.

40:59.582 --> 41:01.374
There they are.

41:01.500 --> 41:02.959
Lead car! Lead car!

41:03.085 --> 41:05.670
'Take that dirt road
off to your right! '

41:17.683 --> 41:21.269
- God! Look at all this dust!
- Roll your window up, dummy!

41:24.482 --> 41:28.526
Hey, uh, this is the Duck to the Pig Pen.
You all still with us back there?

41:29.195 --> 41:32.113
'My water bed is sloshin' around
like it's gonna break.'

41:32.239 --> 41:35.783
Hasn't had this much action since
I caught those twins in Carlsbad.

41:35.910 --> 41:38.369
I'm just followin' your smell, Pig Pen.

41:39.079 --> 41:41.789
- Watch your turn!
- (Black Widow) Oooh!

41:41.916 --> 41:44.417
Jesus Christ! Why don't you watch
what you're doing?

41:44.543 --> 41:46.419
(Pack Rat) Shut up
or you drive the son of a bitch.

41:46.545 --> 41:48.213
(Laughing)

41:48.339 --> 41:50.423
Tell him to get on
one side or the other.

41:51.175 --> 41:54.344
(Bookman) 'Lead car, get on
one side of the road or the other.'

42:03.229 --> 42:05.230
Well now, what's he stopped for?

42:05.356 --> 42:07.690
(Coughing)
Dammit!

42:07.816 --> 42:09.734
Well, we can't wait now.

42:22.831 --> 42:24.290
Watch it!

42:24.416 --> 42:26.543
(White Rat) You're gonna turn
this damn thing over!

42:26.669 --> 42:27.919
(Pack Rat) Shut up!

42:28.045 --> 42:30.171
There's no point in gettin' mad, OK?

42:30.297 --> 42:33.591
- I ain't mad, I'm scared to death!
- (Laughing) I know.

43:11.046 --> 43:13.089
I got 'em, Chief! I got 'em!

43:15.759 --> 43:18.886
(Screaming) Jesus Christ!

43:24.310 --> 43:26.352
- What happened to him?
- I don't know.

43:26.478 --> 43:28.646
He's pulled off here
for some reason or another.

43:32.735 --> 43:35.320
Them cops ain't up to par today
on their drivin'.

43:35.446 --> 43:37.113
One just went over the side.

43:37.239 --> 43:39.449
There's some in bad trouble, Duck.

43:40.492 --> 43:42.827
'They're falling all over the road
over here.

43:42.953 --> 43:46.080
(♪ Waltz)

44:23.118 --> 44:27.205
(♪ Waltz continues)

45:01.198 --> 45:03.658
Feels good, I tell you that!

45:03.784 --> 45:04.909
Ooooh!

45:13.794 --> 45:16.129
'Breaker, this is Spider Mike
at the back door.

45:16.255 --> 45:18.965
'Got us a smokey comin' up fast.

45:19.091 --> 45:21.259
'I'm gonna see if I can't
slow him down a taste.'

(Siren blaring)

45:25.264 --> 45:28.266

to your left. Watch out! '

45:45.868 --> 45:48.035
You lousy son of a b...

45:49.455 --> 45:53.207
Well, Pig Pen, I think he deserves
a break today, what do you say?

45:53.333 --> 45:56.627
Why don't we just, uh... let him
on through, don't ya know?

45:56.754 --> 45:58.212
Hey, that's a big 10-4.

45:59.131 --> 46:01.257
(Siren blaring)

46:02.801 --> 46:04.093
Aaah!

46:04.219 --> 46:06.053
Ah, smartening up, huh?

46:06.180 --> 46:09.682
(Love Machine) 'How about we close
this door? I'm gettin' a draught! '

46:12.436 --> 46:13.644
(Bookman) Go back!

46:18.275 --> 46:20.193
Jesus Christ! Looks like
they're making a sandwich

46:20.319 --> 46:21.903
outta the sheriff back there.

46:23.322 --> 46:25.156
Goddammit!

46:25.282 --> 46:28.075
- (Bookman) Unhook us!
- (Lyle) I can't, we're hooked up!

46:28.202 --> 46:31.788
You must have a bear trap, Pig Pen,
cos you sure have caught one!

46:34.249 --> 46:36.292
- Get down! Get down!
- Shut up, will you?

46:36.418 --> 46:39.003
(Love Machine)
Hey, think I'll try it again.

46:39.129 --> 46:43.341
- God, you bastards!
- Get us away from here!

46:44.968 --> 46:46.928
I think you boys have been practising.

46:48.180 --> 46:50.515
- (Lyle) Aw, come on!
- (Love Machine) Give it to him!

46:50.641 --> 46:52.600
They're tryin' to kill us!

46:52.726 --> 46:55.019
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, noooo!

46:55.145 --> 46:57.480
We're falling apart!
(Metal grinds and grates)

46:57.606 --> 46:59.232
They're trying to kill us!

(Screaming)

47:01.360 --> 47:03.277
(Lyle) Get over, you son of a bitch!

Oh, good work, Sheriff.

47:18.836 --> 47:20.336

Lyle Wallace... '

calling the Sheriff of Natchez.

47:30.681 --> 47:32.139
'Do you read me? '

47:32.266 --> 47:35.768
Uh, this is Chief Stacy Love,
of Agua Dulce, New Mexico.

47:35.894 --> 47:37.186
I got a copy on you.

47:37.312 --> 47:39.647
'I'm on Highway 109.

47:39.773 --> 47:42.984

'And they're being led by a man
called Rubber Duck.

'I suspect that they'll be crossing
your state line pretty quick.'

Uh, thank you, sir.

50:39.036 --> 50:40.745
Brother Rubber?

50:40.871 --> 50:44.331
(Chuckling) What IS that guy's name?
He ain't no reverend.

50:49.671 --> 50:51.714
(Melissa) Why do they call you
the Duck?

50:51.840 --> 50:53.799
Cos it rhymes with "luck".

50:54.843 --> 50:57.845
Naw, my Daddy always told me
I oughta be just like a duck.

50:57.971 --> 51:01.265
He said, "Stay smooth on the surface
and paddle like the devil underneath."

51:08.607 --> 51:10.941
- What ya lookin' for?
- I thought I'd have a beer.

51:11.068 --> 51:15.154
- Do you want one?
- No, thanks. I'm trying to quit.

51:15.280 --> 51:19.283
But you can get me one of those T-shirts
that's on the dresser back there.

51:21.328 --> 51:22.953
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

51:23.080 --> 51:24.789
You're welcome.

51:29.920 --> 51:33.798
A couple of years ago, I was living
with a man I didn't like very much.

51:33.924 --> 51:36.842
He talked me into doing something
I really didn't want to do.

51:36.968 --> 51:38.511
- (Guard) Stop!
- Hang gliding.

51:39.179 --> 51:40.554
(Guard) Damn!

51:43.433 --> 51:44.600
Speak up, honey.

51:46.561 --> 51:49.271
Hang gliding - but I tried it.

51:53.193 --> 51:55.194
And you know what?
I was right, I hated it.

51:55.320 --> 51:58.030
50 trucks.
A whole convoy of trucks bustin'.

51:58.156 --> 51:59.865

- (Followers) 'Amen! '

52:04.996 --> 52:06.664
Thank God, it worked.

52:06.790 --> 52:10.793
- How about the boyfriend?
- Hm, that didn't work.

52:16.800 --> 52:18.634
- (Duck) Any kids?
- (Melissa) Uh-uh.

52:18.760 --> 52:22.513
I was married. I got a couple of kids
livin' up in Spokane.

52:22.639 --> 52:25.516
- Do you ever get to see them?
- When I can.

52:26.226 --> 52:27.893
They're OK. They got a good mama.

52:34.234 --> 52:37.903
'You got room for one Septic Sam,
the sewer man? '

52:38.029 --> 52:40.698
'You got the Pack Rat and the
White Rat here, and welcome aboard.'

52:40.824 --> 52:43.200

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:58.375
And if it is, what's its purpose?

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:04.422
The purpose of the convoy
is to keep movin'.

01:04:05.716 --> 01:04:07.342
Ask him why he wants to know.

01:04:08.761 --> 01:04:10.637
You wanna run this?

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:17.936
Hey, look, I'm a little busy right now,
as you can see.

01:04:18.062 --> 01:04:21.356
Why don't you try and talk
to some of them back there?

01:04:21.482 --> 01:04:25.527
All right, will do, Rubber Duck, uh...
I'll be back to you later.

01:04:25.653 --> 01:04:28.029
- (Arnoldi) 10-4.
- Good buddy(!)

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:34.327
'This is Chuck Arnoldi
of the Governor's Office, sir.

01:04:34.453 --> 01:04:38.290
- 'I wonder if I could talk to you.
- 'Call me Old Iguana.'

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:40.917
'Old Iguana, eh?
Where were you born, sir? '

01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:44.004
Originally?

01:04:46.007 --> 01:04:48.258
(Iguana) 'I've been driving
18-wheelers as long as... '

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:50.176
How about it?

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:53.513
- Think I oughta talk to him?
- Yeah, I do.

01:04:57.184 --> 01:05:00.020
We're sick and tired of beatin'
our eyeballs out coast to coast

01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:02.814
and havin' the damn Smokies rip us off
for our green stamps.

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:05.066
So you believe in what
the Rubber Duck's doing, is that it?

01:05:06.819 --> 01:05:09.362
I'm tired of seein'
the way black people have to live.

01:05:09.488 --> 01:05:13.533
'Went to Vietnam and got shot
for the right to live in a ghetto.'

01:05:13.659 --> 01:05:15.201
(Trucker) 'I go from A to B.

01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:18.288
'The faster I can get from A to B
the more money I make.

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:20.707
'At 55, I can't deal with it.'

01:05:21.417 --> 01:05:26.087
(Trucker) 'Big oil companies
raise the prices of oil and gas

01:05:26.213 --> 01:05:28.423
'which gets back to the consumer,
we gotta raise all our prices... '

01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:30.216
Listen to them!

01:05:30.343 --> 01:05:32.510
Big money's what I'm trying to say.

01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:36.514
They're talking about their future,
not just yours.

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:38.850
(Sneaky snake) 'Well, the whole thing
was a cover-up for Watergate.

01:05:38.976 --> 01:05:40.393
'It went way back to Nixon.'

01:05:40.519 --> 01:05:42.979
First thing to remember...
Nixon...

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:44.731
Nixon got caught with his pants down

01:05:44.857 --> 01:05:47.984

had it out.

'Governor Rockefeller retired
as Governor of New York,

Yes, sir. Well, you put that very well, sir.
Thank you very much!

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:19.557
Sir, I wonder if I could ask you why you're
in this convoy with the Rubber Duck.

01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:23.645
Well, I'm just along to kick ass
and for the ride.

01:06:23.771 --> 01:06:26.856
Yeah, but, well, uh, surely you must have
some kind of personal grievance

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:29.943
against the laws of this state?

01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:34.322
No, I just like kickin' ass. You sure are
a pretty red-headed little boy.

01:06:34.448 --> 01:06:38.243
Wanna ride in my truck?
We oughta have supper!

(Big Nasty cackling)

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:42.956
Why do you think you have the right
to break the laws of this state?

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:46.001
- You want me to tell you why?
- Yes, I'd like to...

01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:49.004
- OK, watch this!
- Jesus Christ!

01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:52.632
- Some of these people are crazy.
- Watch this!

01:06:52.758 --> 01:06:55.427
(Mumbling)
Uh... Uh...

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:58.888
Well, Reverend, can you tell me
if you see this convoy

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:01.641
as more of a spiritual
than a political event?

01:07:01.767 --> 01:07:05.812
Well, life itself is a spiritual event.

01:07:05.938 --> 01:07:08.148
- (Followers) Amen! Amen!
- (Sloane) That's a big 10-4!

(Arnoldi) Breaker 1-9.
Breaker 1-9 to the Rubber Duck.

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:28.752
This is Chuck Arnoldi.
Can I talk to you again, please?

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:31.963
Uh, this is the Duck, Chuck.
What did you learn?

01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:33.548
I learned a lot.

01:07:33.674 --> 01:07:38.678
Now look, the Governor is very interested
in meeting with you, personally.

01:07:38.804 --> 01:07:43.433
He is prepared to fly here at once
and get together with all of you.

01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:46.352
So we've set aside a field
here in Albuquerque

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:47.687
where you can spend the night.

01:07:47.813 --> 01:07:49.814
Now look, the police have orders
not to bother you.

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:51.357
That's the truth!

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:54.569
Bullshit!

01:07:57.281 --> 01:07:59.115
Can I level with you?

01:07:59.617 --> 01:08:02.952
- Level with me.
- I want to talk to him off the record.

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:06.456
I don't want this on the television.
I don't want this printed.

01:08:09.668 --> 01:08:12.796
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

01:08:13.672 --> 01:08:18.093
The Governor has been requested
to call out the National Guard on you.

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:23.640
But this is an election year
and the Governor wants to...

01:08:23.765 --> 01:08:27.769
hell, he expects to be part of it,
on a Senatorial level.

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:31.397
These people out here watching you.

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:34.234
Do you know who they are,
what they are?

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:35.401
Do you?

01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:37.237
They're voters!

01:08:38.863 --> 01:08:40.532
How it's gonna look to them

01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:44.243
if the Governor tells the army
to blow the shit out of your convoy?

01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:48.915
Maybe you can help him.
Maybe he can help you!

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:51.334
(Camera clicking)

01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:55.462
Do we have any choice?

01:09:01.428 --> 01:09:03.595
(Thunder rumbles)

01:09:05.265 --> 01:09:09.685
'Spider Mike callin' the Duck. Say Duck,
I just got a skip from my home 20.

'You're talking to a damn near daddy.
Can you dig it? '

Hey, that's great news, Mike.

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:19.028
I'm gonna have to split, though.

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:21.531
So, uh, you all take care.

01:09:21.657 --> 01:09:24.200
(Duck) 'We're gonna miss you, buddy.
Give our love to the old lady.

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:27.537
'Hey Mike, this is Love Machine.
It's been good travellin' with you.

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:29.622
'Good luck with your baby, OK? '

01:09:29.747 --> 01:09:31.416
(Melissa)
'It was nice meeting you, Mike.'

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:33.585

(Pack Rat) 'Hey Mike, old partner,
keep the pedal to the metal

01:09:36.087 --> 01:09:37.755

You all take care.
Keep 'em movin' all right for me.

Jesus, I hope he makes it.

01:09:56.901 --> 01:10:00.028
He's going through some bad country
for a black truck driver.

01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:03.448
(Arnoldi)
Governor, you couldn't ask

01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:06.117
for a better opportunity
to make the headlines.

01:10:06.243 --> 01:10:10.538
Liberal, humanitarian headlines.

01:10:10.664 --> 01:10:15.376
Truckers. Trash.
Just plain old trash.

01:10:15.502 --> 01:10:18.796
- No, average people.
- Trash!

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:22.133
To tell you the truth, Henry,
I think this damn convoy

01:10:22.259 --> 01:10:24.719
has more public support than we do.

01:10:27.264 --> 01:10:28.473
Bring in Sheriff Wallace.

01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:32.518
I'm afraid Sheriff Wallace
left for Texas in a hurry.

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:33.645
Texas?

01:10:33.771 --> 01:10:36.105
Well, what the hell
is he going to do in Texas?

(Duck) 'We're runnin' RPM up
about 21 hundred and shifting,

'Between 18 and 21.'

(Melissa) You really love
this truck, don't you?

01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:57.252
(Duck) I certainly do NOT love
this truck.

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:01.506
You oughta meet Ramblin' Jack Elliott.

01:11:01.632 --> 01:11:04.384
Talk about a man who loves his truck,
bumper to bumper.

01:11:05.386 --> 01:11:07.637
He named his dog "Kenworth".

01:11:07.763 --> 01:11:10.974
I like knowin' how she runs but, uh,

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.351
it's really the driving!

no official comment at this time,

(♪ Group singing)

01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:42.130
Goddammit, I'll meet you outside.

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:48.303
Give me one shot at the Governor and
I'll corner him with documented evidence

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:49.470
to prove the Republican Party...

01:11:49.596 --> 01:11:52.265
Does anybody know
where we can find the Rubber Duck?

01:11:52.391 --> 01:11:54.392
Hey man, lay off.
Give him a chance to dry off, uh?

01:11:54.518 --> 01:11:55.685
We're just trying
to get a couple pictures!

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:58.688
No, no, I don't think so.
You're not gonna get no pictures.

01:11:58.814 --> 01:12:00.648
You know what you can do
with your money?

01:12:01.358 --> 01:12:04.110
No, you take your body out of here.
Your cameras, too.

01:12:04.236 --> 01:12:08.239
- Hey, you made good time, Lyle.
- Yeah, I had a pretty good pilot.

01:12:08.365 --> 01:12:10.325
A little tired, though.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:13.453
Here he is, Lyle.

01:12:22.212 --> 01:12:26.758
Boy, you sure are
one dumb black son of a bitch!

01:12:30.095 --> 01:12:34.640
You got here a little late for the fun.
You would have enjoyed it.

01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:41.606
Man, you sure know how to hurt.

01:12:42.566 --> 01:12:43.983
You resisted arrest.

01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:49.238
I'll plead guilty, whatever you say.
(Gasping) Just don't hit me anymore.

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:53.701
I didn't hit you.
I helped you up.

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:57.372
Thank you, sir, but I don't need
any more of your help.

01:12:58.749 --> 01:12:59.874
Let's go, Lyle.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:07.048
Yeah. Listen boy, if I hear anything
about your kid I'll let you know.

01:13:10.511 --> 01:13:13.513
Looks like you're gonna be with us
for a while.

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:14.680
What for?

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:17.308
Bait.

01:13:23.023 --> 01:13:26.025
What happens, Lyle,
when he brings all those trucks?

01:13:26.151 --> 01:13:28.569
Ah, he won't do that.
Not his style.

01:13:28.695 --> 01:13:32.657
Our syndicate would be very interested
in buying any photographs you have.

01:13:32.783 --> 01:13:35.827
- We'll give you a very good deal.
- What's a very good deal?

01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:39.539
Oh, if the photographs are good,
$500.

01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:42.166
(Laughing)
More like $2,500.

01:13:42.292 --> 01:13:44.502
Then you'll have an exclusive
for the first instalment.

01:13:44.628 --> 01:13:46.546
- I don't think...
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:48.381
This is no time to be talking business.

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:51.008
Excuse me, please,
I think I'll get dressed.

01:13:51.135 --> 01:13:53.594
- Hey, you're the Rubber Duck!
- That's right. I'm in a real hurry.

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.014
- I'm just tryin' to work a deal.
- So am I, brother. So am I.

01:13:58.767 --> 01:14:00.643
You're all wet.

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:01.894
Is that so?

01:14:03.814 --> 01:14:05.064
It's becoming.

01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:06.941
- Guess what.
- What?

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:09.193
I'm about to sell you out!

01:14:10.654 --> 01:14:12.196
(Man) You all right?

01:14:13.657 --> 01:14:15.950
You, you with that convoy?

01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:21.164
Don't you worry. I'll get ya help.

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:33.759
I ain't sellin' no stories.

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:37.513
The hell you're not.
We're talking about a lot of money.

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:40.475
Whoever buys this story
is gonna have to pay through the nose.

01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:41.851
I believe that!

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:44.604
And we're gonna need it.

01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:47.190
Because I see
a lot of lawyers in our future.

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:48.858
- You do, uh?
- Mm-hm.

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:50.985
And I'm involved.

01:14:51.695 --> 01:14:52.820
You are, uh?

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:56.282
What in?

01:14:56.408 --> 01:14:58.284
Don't give me
any more of your nonsense, please.

01:14:58.410 --> 01:15:00.203
I'm really trying to help.

01:15:00.704 --> 01:15:02.205
I know you are.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:06.542
I'm serious. I'm really interested in knowing
what it is you think you're involved in.

01:15:08.086 --> 01:15:11.088
Because I'm beginning
to think I got no idea.

01:15:16.136 --> 01:15:18.971
We can go talk it over in the truck,
if you want.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:26.312
(Laughing)

01:15:26.438 --> 01:15:30.816
(Man) 'Breaker 1-9.
Emergency 10-33.

01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:36.072

out there westbound who can read me?

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:37.907
'Come on.'

01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:43.329
'Hey, you got the Spanish Fly here.
I got a copy on you, go! '

01:15:43.455 --> 01:15:47.583
I need a message relayed west
to Rubber Duck in the convoy.

01:16:06.144 --> 01:16:08.938
(Knocking)
Hey, Duck!

01:16:10.274 --> 01:16:11.440
Hey, Duck!
(Knocking)

01:16:16.363 --> 01:16:19.699
'Bobby, you know you're really something.
You're perfect.

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:22.827
- I'll come back.
- No, wait a minute, man.

01:16:22.953 --> 01:16:25.955
(Door closes)
What you got on your mind?

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:29.125
This Disneyland.
Let's get off this merry-go-round.

'Breaker, breaker, this is Mother Trucker.

'Repeat. Spider Mike needs help.'

01:16:47.811 --> 01:16:49.604
(Duck) I don't know what to do,
Bobby.

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:52.481
I've been thinking about all those towns
we've gone through

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:54.984
and all them people
who was cheerin' us, man.

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:56.902
People fallin' in behind us.

01:16:57.487 --> 01:17:00.072
- And I think I've figured it out.
- A chopper!

01:17:00.198 --> 01:17:03.492
The reason they're coming in behind us
is who the hell else they got?

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:05.453
Nobody, that's who.

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:09.415
This guy up here, man, he may not
be any straighter than anybody else,

01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:11.792
but he sees somethin' down here
that he wants to use

01:17:11.918 --> 01:17:13.794
or he wouldn't even be messin' with us.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.921
So that means he's worth dealin' with.

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:17.882
(Helicopter approaching)

01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:19.425
Look at all them people.

01:17:19.551 --> 01:17:22.219
Just remember,
when I used to steal cookies,

01:17:22.346 --> 01:17:25.014
the faster I ran
the less I had to split.

01:17:27.392 --> 01:17:31.312
'Breaker 1-9 for 10-33.
This is the Midnight Mover.

01:17:31.438 --> 01:17:35.107
'Spider Mike's in truckers' hell

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:43.949
Give me time alone with him first.

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:51.582
Are you sure the perimeters
are manned?

01:17:51.708 --> 01:17:54.377
(Crowd cheering)
Haskins! Here comes Haskins!

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:57.505
Haskins! Haskins!
Here comes Haskins!

01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:02.343
Duck! Don't pass the buck! Duck!

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:05.596
Don't pass the buck! Duck! Duck!

01:18:05.722 --> 01:18:08.224
Don't pass the buck! Duck!

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:11.727

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.276
(Crowd cheering)

01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:22.947
Gerry Haskins, Duck.
Glad you could take the time to see me.

01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:24.949
I mean, I know how busy you are.

01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:28.577
Well, it looks like you got a hell
of a cross-section of people here.

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:32.873
(Chuckling) I mean, there's no question
that most of their bitches are...

01:18:32.999 --> 01:18:36.252
probably legitimate,
but you know...

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:39.380
...I think the question
we're facing is,

01:18:39.506 --> 01:18:41.590
how do we take effective action
together?

01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:45.344
I mean I know your cause or causes
should be defined and, uh...

01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:47.221
- Katie, darling, how are you?
- Governor, welcome.

01:18:47.347 --> 01:18:51.726
- The press are waiting for you.
- Oh, good. Let's go over to the tent.

01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:53.894
I'll have a little talk with the Duck.

01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:56.939
We got a legitimate hero,
a public figure.

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:00.776
(Press and crowd chattering)

01:19:00.902 --> 01:19:04.238
'Breaker 1-9 to 10-33.
This is White Line Willie... '

01:19:04.364 --> 01:19:06.449
It's obvious this represents
something more

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:10.035
than the banning
of the 55-mile speed limit, right?

01:19:10.162 --> 01:19:12.121
It's nothing to do
with the 55 mile an hour...

01:19:12.247 --> 01:19:14.623
(Trucker) 'Spider Mike's in jail
and they beat him up bad.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.834
'Pass the message on.'

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.004
With my aides, we can draft up
a list of your grievances.

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:23.215
'Spider Mike's down in Alvarez, Texas,
and Old Tiny beat the hell out of him.'

01:19:23.341 --> 01:19:26.719
'Lyle Wallace got Spider Mike in jail.
I heard they broke his back.'

01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:29.138
'Lyle split his skull wide open.'

01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:33.309
I will be elected!
(Crowd cheering)

01:19:38.982 --> 01:19:40.983
Hello, Bertie. Good to see you.

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:44.528
Oh, Governor Haskins, we're so happy
to have you here in Albuquerque.

01:19:44.654 --> 01:19:47.865
Well, it's great to be here, cos you're
doing such a wonderful job, all of you.

01:19:47.991 --> 01:19:50.701
- In fact, I'd like to just have a moment...
- How about some comments?

01:19:50.827 --> 01:19:52.745
Jake, just a minute.
You know better than that.

01:19:52.871 --> 01:19:55.289
I'd like to have a moment alone
with the Duck.

01:19:55.832 --> 01:19:58.250
And then I'll be happy to talk to all of you.

01:19:58.376 --> 01:20:01.295
Everybody out, please. Everybody.

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:05.674
- We got deadlines to meet, you know.
- Bill, I'll do the best I can.

01:20:19.314 --> 01:20:21.232
Think he's gonna need some help?

01:20:23.318 --> 01:20:24.443
Yeah, let's go.

01:20:25.278 --> 01:20:28.447
But I'll give you my word that
I'll apply all the pressure I can.

01:20:29.241 --> 01:20:30.991
And I can apply pressure.

01:20:32.536 --> 01:20:36.580
But I wouldn't plan a return visit
to Arizona for a while, if I were you.

01:20:36.706 --> 01:20:38.707
- I don't.
- Good.

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:41.377
- Black or white?
- What do you have in mind?

01:20:42.212 --> 01:20:43.379
Coffee.

01:20:44.881 --> 01:20:47.383
Black. What else do you have in mind?

01:20:48.134 --> 01:20:51.846
I want to take you to Washington DC,
as a people's leader.

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:56.684
Which is just what you've become.
See, I need you there, Duck.

01:20:57.143 --> 01:20:59.854
Come on, Reverend.
We've got a problem.

01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:08.737
And I think you need me here.

01:21:10.323 --> 01:21:11.365
All of you.

01:21:14.369 --> 01:21:16.787
- OK, let us through.
- Let us through.

01:21:17.914 --> 01:21:19.832
They got Mike! They got Spider Mike.

01:21:19.958 --> 01:21:22.459
Lyle and Tiny Alvarez have him
in truckers' hell.

01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:25.671
Yeah! I hear they beat him half to death
and got him in jail!

01:21:25.797 --> 01:21:28.632
What the hell is Lyle doin'
in Alvarez, Texas?

01:21:28.758 --> 01:21:30.217
Hey, don't worry, I'll go get him.

01:21:30.343 --> 01:21:32.553
- (Chatter) I'll go with you.
- Hey, we'll all go get him.

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:35.639
Wait a minute!
Just wait a minute, all of you!

01:21:35.765 --> 01:21:38.058
Hold it! Hey!
Will you grow up?

01:21:38.685 --> 01:21:40.644
I mean, all of you, will you just grow up?

01:21:41.396 --> 01:21:42.605
Hey, will you help us?

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:46.275
That's what I'm trying to do!
I'm just one man.

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:50.613
I can't reach outta my office
and, uh, pluck criminals out of jail,

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:51.864
left and right.

01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:53.991
(Uproar)

01:21:54.951 --> 01:21:57.328
Sometimes,
you have to sacrifice the individual.

01:21:57.454 --> 01:21:59.121
Bullshit!

01:21:59.247 --> 01:22:02.958
- For the cause of the common purpose.
- He's right, you know.

01:22:04.711 --> 01:22:07.963
It could take weeks, months.
Don't kill this!

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:12.009
- You started something very good here.
- Look, I'll do all I can to help you.

01:22:12.844 --> 01:22:16.388
But I'm afraid he's gonna have
to fend for himself for a while.

01:22:16.514 --> 01:22:18.098
Is that it?

01:22:18.683 --> 01:22:20.684
Yeah, that's it.

01:22:22.812 --> 01:22:24.730
OK, partner, I gotta go.

01:22:24.856 --> 01:22:26.607
You're in charge, now.

01:22:26.733 --> 01:22:30.235
You know what we need
and what we're up against.

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:33.405
Get what you can from the man, and...

01:22:33.531 --> 01:22:35.199
she'll help you.

01:22:35.325 --> 01:22:37.618
You're leaving?

01:22:37.744 --> 01:22:39.745
Why?

01:22:39.871 --> 01:22:42.164
Hey, why does it always have to be you?

01:22:44.542 --> 01:22:45.668
I don't know.

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.962
Just when we were starting to get
something accomplished.

01:22:48.088 --> 01:22:50.839
All these people! Don't you give a damn
what's gonna happen to them?

01:22:51.841 --> 01:22:53.384
- (Chatter)
- Chuck...

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:56.387
Stay back, stay back.

01:22:57.263 --> 01:23:00.015
Hey, you can do me a favour.
Will you stay here and...

01:23:00.141 --> 01:23:01.558
Watch it.

01:23:01.685 --> 01:23:05.354
You can do me a favour. Stay here
and help Bobby sort this out.

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:09.817
He ain't so good at stringing
them words together as you are.

01:23:10.735 --> 01:23:14.488
- Where you goin', Duck?
- Governor didn't do anything, did he?

01:23:23.498 --> 01:23:25.082
Hey, Duck?

01:23:26.626 --> 01:23:27.918
You comin' back?

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:41.306
Son of a bitch! What are we gonna do
without the Duck, now?

01:23:44.269 --> 01:23:47.271
(Engine starting)

01:24:38.865 --> 01:24:41.700
Hey, Melissa?

01:24:41.826 --> 01:24:45.412
How come you didn't stay
with the press people?

01:24:45.538 --> 01:24:47.081
They seemed to like you.

01:24:48.124 --> 01:24:49.583
I just didn't feel like it.

01:24:50.627 --> 01:24:52.377
(Sighing)
Oh.

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:55.255
Uh... Well...

01:24:59.177 --> 01:25:00.969
Ma'am...

01:25:02.597 --> 01:25:04.306
Can I let you off some place?

01:25:06.309 --> 01:25:08.519
- No?
- No, thank you.

01:25:11.606 --> 01:25:14.399
Oh, oh, boy!

01:25:16.569 --> 01:25:21.698
