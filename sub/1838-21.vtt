04:22.567 --> 04:24.300
WAS MY TOP RIVAL
AT COOKING SCHOOL,

04:24.300 --> 04:27.100
AND THANKS TO HIM,
I ALMOST DIDN'T
BECOME A CHEF.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.500
IT WAS OUR SENIOR COOK-OFF,
AND LEONARD AND I

04:29.500 --> 04:34.934
WERE COMPETING TO SEE
WHO WOULD BE NAMED
TOP CHEF OF OUR CLASS.

04:37.300 --> 04:39.734
WE HAD TO MAKE
STUFFED MACKEREL.

04:39.734 --> 04:41.000
I WAS FEELING
PRETTY CONFIDENT,

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
THAT IS UNTIL LEONARD
DID HIS FLIP.

04:50.967 --> 04:54.467
NO ONE HAD EVER DONE
A DOUBLE FLIP BEFORE.

04:54.467 --> 04:59.000
I KNEW I HAD TO TRY
IF I WAS GONNA
STAND A CHANCE.

05:09.367 --> 05:12.300
AND THAT'S THE STORY.
LEONARD BECAME TOP CHEF,

05:12.300 --> 05:15.600
AND I NEVER FLIPPED
A FISH AGAIN.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.200
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT, DAD.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.500
I'VE SEEN YOU FLIP
A LOT OF THINGS,

05:19.500 --> 05:22.300
BUT NEVER ANY FISH.

05:23.900 --> 05:28.467

GONNA BE STUFFED MACKEREL.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.133
OHH! DAD,
I HAD A VISION.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.467
I KNOW WHAT
THE CHALLENGE FOOD
IS GONNA BE.

05:34.467 --> 05:37.000
HUMPH! IF I KNOW LEONARD,
IT'S GONNA BE
STUFFED MACKEREL.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.934
YOU'RE RIGHT! THAT'S
A GOOD THING, DAD.

05:39.934 --> 05:41.367
RAVEN, HOW IS THAT
A GOOD THING?

05:41.367 --> 05:44.400
THIS IS JUST
ANOTHER CHANCE FOR HIM
TO HUMILIATE ME.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.567
NO, DAD.
THIS IS A CHANCE
TO PROVE YOURSELF,

05:46.567 --> 05:48.934

HAVE AN EDGE
BECAUSE NOW YOU KNOW

05:48.934 --> 05:50.834
WHAT THE CHALLENGE
FOOD IS GONNA BE.

05:52.033 --> 05:55.734
DAD, HOW MANY TIMES
IN LIFE DO YOU GET
A SECOND CHANCE?

05:55.734 --> 06:00.400
WELL, I HAVE THOUGHT
ABOUT THIS, LIKE,
A MILLION TIMES.

06:00.400 --> 06:03.500
SO, DAD, WHAT ARE
YOU WAITING FOR?

06:03.500 --> 06:05.800
YOU'RE RIGHT. HA HA!
THIS IS MY CHANCE

06:05.800 --> 06:09.500
