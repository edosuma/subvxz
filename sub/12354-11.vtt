WEBVTT

00:00.005 --> 00:01.016
Previously on House of lies...

00:01.018 --> 00:03.186
There's nothing going on
between Marty and I.

00:03.187 --> 00:04.187
Huh.
Nothing.

00:04.188 --> 00:06.590
I am sleeping with Tamara.

00:06.591 --> 00:07.791
That's what I like
about you, Marty.

00:07.792 --> 00:08.959
You shoot straight.

00:08.960 --> 00:10.900
So Kevin decides to take
this job in New York

00:10.901 --> 00:13.313
even after we promised
one another that my career

00:13.314 --> 00:15.007
would take priority.

00:15.008 --> 00:17.935
Leave right now and spend the
rest of the afternoon with me.

00:17.936 --> 00:21.467
The dushkin twin brand.

00:21.468 --> 00:22.801
I'm gonna start my own shop.

00:22.802 --> 00:24.536
Julianne has offered
me my own pod.

00:24.537 --> 00:26.433
I thought you were coming with me. I am.

00:26.434 --> 00:28.865
Look, I'm not implying that
you guys don't know Carlson.

00:28.866 --> 00:30.264
<i>We don't just know the dude.</i>

00:30.265 --> 00:31.764
We're seriously tight.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.796
<i>We have
another strategy that would</i>

00:33.797 --> 00:36.296
just blast the dead bolt
off of fort knox.

00:36.297 --> 00:37.963
Unfortunately,
we're unable to propose it

00:37.964 --> 00:40.633
at this time, because we've put
it in front of another casino.

00:40.634 --> 00:41.869
It's fucking Carlson, isn't it?

00:41.870 --> 00:43.103
You cannot set up your own shop

00:43.104 --> 00:44.270
coming off of an
$80 million deal

00:44.271 --> 00:46.607
blowing up in your face.

00:46.608 --> 00:47.709
That Marty on the line?

00:47.710 --> 00:48.776
Remind him

00:48.777 --> 00:49.942
that I own his ass.

00:49.943 --> 00:51.975
I own your ass, motherfucker!

00:59.052 --> 01:01.053
<i>If you look
at the profit projections</i>

01:01.054 --> 01:03.223
<i>going into the last
fiscal quarter, you'll see</i>

01:03.224 --> 01:05.859
<i>that in every category,
the projections were all</i>

01:05.860 --> 01:06.959
within the percentage point
of the article.

01:06.960 --> 01:08.694
Uh-huh.

01:08.695 --> 01:10.829
Hey, guys, guys, I got to
put you on mute for a second.

01:10.830 --> 01:13.064
Don't say anything
interesting until I get back.

01:13.065 --> 01:15.902
There you are.

01:15.903 --> 01:19.005
Wow, your business meetings
are more boring than ours are.

01:19.006 --> 01:20.740
Um, it's definitely-- it's
different when you're there.

01:20.741 --> 01:21.974
Everybody's naked.

01:21.975 --> 01:23.809
I'm so sorry
to make you miss that.

01:23.810 --> 01:26.079
It's all right. You really
didn't have to pick me up.

01:26.080 --> 01:27.546
I wasn't going to
leave you stranded

01:27.547 --> 01:28.647
on the side of the road.

01:28.648 --> 01:30.216
I could have called
a tow truck.

01:30.217 --> 01:32.218
Yes, I'm very, very sorry.

01:32.219 --> 01:35.154
I-I-I thought I could
change a flat, and...

01:35.155 --> 01:36.389
You know what?
You know, it...

01:36.390 --> 01:38.323
That lug nut,
it was very tight.

01:38.324 --> 01:39.992
Wasn't it, though?
It was tighter

01:39.993 --> 01:41.393
than it should have been.
Okay, all right.

01:41.394 --> 01:42.560
You saw it.

01:42.561 --> 01:44.228
I-- okay, good,
thank you.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.229
Pick you up later?

01:45.230 --> 01:47.497
Yeah.
All right.

01:47.498 --> 01:49.365
Bye.
Bye.

01:49.366 --> 01:51.333
This is just a regular...?
You got to, you got to pull it,

01:51.334 --> 01:54.168
you got to pull it up and then
in and then down and then out.

01:54.169 --> 01:55.503
And out-- wow.

01:55.504 --> 01:57.572

Hey, would you look at this?

02:35.103 --> 02:38.272
The four of us arriving
at the exact same time.

02:38.273 --> 02:39.740
What are the odds of that, huh?

02:39.741 --> 02:40.807

02:48.915 --> 02:51.048
Don't high-five.

02:51.049 --> 02:52.783
No, I'm not high-fiving that.
Yeah, where did that come from?

02:52.784 --> 02:54.051
Nowhere.

02:54.052 --> 02:56.253
Love it when you call me
into the office.

02:56.254 --> 02:58.587
We'll... do this in privacy.

02:58.588 --> 03:00.489
Mm-hmm, I like
where it's headed.

03:00.490 --> 03:03.891
Okay, listen, uh, I got
this venture capitalist

03:03.892 --> 03:05.560
who's about to pony up
some seed money.

03:05.561 --> 03:07.429
Okay, I'm this close
to being up out this bitch.

03:07.430 --> 03:09.064
Now, Jeannie knows
but nobody else,

03:09.065 --> 03:10.732
and I just want to keep
it that... but wait, baby,

03:10.733 --> 03:11.933
what, what about
the Carlson deal?

03:11.934 --> 03:13.301
It's not closed yet.

03:13.302 --> 03:15.169
Oh, I'll just hand off
the work to you.

03:15.170 --> 03:16.771
I mean, he likes you
a lot better

03:16.772 --> 03:19.073
than he likes me anyway, so...

03:19.074 --> 03:22.176
But, Marty, you're,
you're spearheading the whole thing.

03:22.177 --> 03:24.278
If you leave now, the
deal could just blow up.

03:24.279 --> 03:27.081
No, no, no, he's legally tied
to galweather, okay?

03:27.082 --> 03:29.349
Now, I guess I could use
the feather in my cap,

03:29.350 --> 03:30.584
but I can definitely survive

03:30.585 --> 03:32.452
without it.
Well, I can't.

03:32.453 --> 03:33.920
Marty, we are this close.

03:33.921 --> 03:37.490
We track Carlson down,
we get the deal signed,

03:37.491 --> 03:40.092
and it's done and you can
ride off into the sunset.

03:40.093 --> 03:42.161
T, you're going
to be all right.

03:43.764 --> 03:45.164
Marty, this is

03:45.165 --> 03:48.935
my first engagement
back in six years.

03:48.936 --> 03:51.170
I need this win, baby.

03:51.171 --> 03:53.606
Please do this for me.

03:53.607 --> 03:56.009
What are you gonna do for me?

03:56.010 --> 03:58.711
The unspeakable.

03:58.712 --> 04:00.646
I guess we better find
this asshole quick, huh?

04:00.647 --> 04:01.714
Mmm!

04:01.715 --> 04:03.516
<i>You mean the unspeakable?</i>

04:03.517 --> 04:04.817
<i>The unspeakable.
Okay, the money.</i>

04:04.818 --> 04:06.885
That's, uh, great work, man.

04:06.886 --> 04:08.353
Thank you, my friend,
I appreciate it.

04:08.354 --> 04:11.956
Expiration 8-14.

04:11.957 --> 04:13.191
Do you see this, Doug?
Okay, thanks.

04:13.192 --> 04:14.559
You get your own pod
and you can make

04:14.560 --> 04:16.060
as many personal calls
as you want.

04:16.062 --> 04:17.963
I'm having my car towed.

04:17.964 --> 04:19.498
Of course you are.
Hey, um,

04:19.499 --> 04:22.501
if you're feeling overlooked
or underappreciated,

04:22.502 --> 04:24.804
I just want you to know that's--
it's not my problem.

04:24.805 --> 04:27.240
Pish-posh, pish-posh, Jeannie,
don't even worry about it,

04:27.241 --> 04:28.708
'cause I'm about
to sell the dushkins

04:28.709 --> 04:29.976
on a club expansion
that is going

04:29.977 --> 04:33.681
to bring so much afterwork
cashish to this company...

04:33.682 --> 04:35.983
I feel like
julianne hofschraeger's gonna be.

04:35.984 --> 04:39.987
"Clyde oberholt,
mmm, you're a God.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.156
You are a man amongst
other smaller, tinier men."

04:42.157 --> 04:43.991
She'll probably

04:43.992 --> 04:45.559
offer me my own pod.

04:45.560 --> 04:48.096
I mean, they still give
those out based on merit, right?

04:49.565 --> 04:50.665
You done?

04:50.666 --> 04:52.333
Nah, I'm not.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.001
No way, he "di'n't."

04:54.002 --> 04:57.605
Stay out, man.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.909
Yeah, I'm sorry about
your, uh, car problems.

05:01.910 --> 05:03.177
That's okay.
Thank you, Doug.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.846
No, it's okay.

05:04.847 --> 05:07.882
You know, Sarah's always
having car trouble-- always.

05:07.883 --> 05:10.385
You know, that's part of the
reason I don't like her making

05:10.386 --> 05:13.121
that long drive all the way up
from San Diego, you know.

05:13.122 --> 05:15.790
Uh-huh. I've tried to
get her to move up here,

05:15.791 --> 05:20.428
but, uh, it's not easy, me being
the only person she knows and...

05:20.429 --> 05:22.030
Hey...

05:22.031 --> 05:25.233
You know what I'm thinking
now, uh, top of my head,

05:25.234 --> 05:28.202
is I-I-it might be easier
for her if she had,

05:28.203 --> 05:31.038
like, an L.A. gal pal to, uh...

05:31.039 --> 05:32.773
<i>I don't know,
sex and the city it up with.</i>

05:33.775 --> 05:35.109
What do you think?

05:35.110 --> 05:36.978
I think you need fresher
cultural references.

05:36.979 --> 05:39.814
Please, Jeannie, please,
please, come on,

05:39.815 --> 05:41.583
I'm begging you.
I need her here.

What do you mean in a different...?
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

06:13.418 --> 06:15.086
So we've been thinking
about what you guys said

06:15.087 --> 06:16.320
about being the brand, right?

06:16.321 --> 06:17.655
Good. Right, and we want

06:17.656 --> 06:20.091
to be p. Diddy-- our own
clothing line. Alcohol.

06:20.092 --> 06:22.494
Cologne. Yeah, when we
talked about being the brand,

06:22.495 --> 06:24.496
we didn't mean to start your own
clothing line. Yeah, so we took

06:24.497 --> 06:26.832
the liberty of having
a prototype made up.

06:27.867 --> 06:29.268
Check it.

06:31.104 --> 06:33.005
Mmm.

06:33.006 --> 06:35.107
That smells like...

06:35.108 --> 06:36.775
It's pussy.
It's what now?

06:36.776 --> 06:37.776
I'm sorry?

06:37.777 --> 06:41.847
We call it "snatch by dushkin."

06:41.848 --> 06:43.182
Mmm.

06:43.183 --> 06:45.452
You're gonna call
the product snatch?

06:45.453 --> 06:46.620
By dushkin. By dushkin.

06:46.621 --> 06:47.854
I heard you, yeah.

06:47.855 --> 06:49.056
Dushkins.

06:49.057 --> 06:50.058
Aah!

06:50.059 --> 06:52.360
Marty.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.738
Is everything okay down there?

07:01.739 --> 07:03.473
It's pussy in a bottle, Marty.

07:03.474 --> 07:04.808
Oh. Let me hit you with a spritz

07:04.809 --> 07:05.975
of snatch.
No, no, no.

07:05.976 --> 07:07.243
I... no, I'm good, I'll just...

07:07.244 --> 07:09.146
I'll get the contact snatch.

07:09.147 --> 07:11.214
It's good, right? That's--
yeah, it's...

07:12.650 --> 07:15.151
Hey, uh, I am trying
to find Mr. Carlson.

07:15.152 --> 07:16.653
He's not returning my calls.

07:16.654 --> 07:17.987
Oh, yeah, good luck with that.

07:17.988 --> 07:19.889
He's not happy with you, Marty.

07:19.890 --> 07:21.090
What are you talking about?

07:21.091 --> 07:22.392
Said you blew him off.

07:22.393 --> 07:23.994
I didn't blow...
When did I blow him off?

07:23.995 --> 07:26.329
The p&g deposition.

07:26.330 --> 07:29.233
Guys, are you
fucking kidding me?

07:29.234 --> 07:30.434
Your man is having
a temper tantrum

07:30.435 --> 07:32.036
because I went to a legally

07:32.037 --> 07:34.406
mandated deposition?
Hey, look,

07:34.407 --> 07:36.241
when it comes to business,
he's a bad-ass ninja,

07:36.242 --> 07:37.943
but he's also
an extremely sensitive soul.

07:37.944 --> 07:41.246
Yeah, Marty, you got to make
this shit right with Carlson.

07:41.247 --> 07:43.215
So get me in a room
with this dude.

07:43.216 --> 07:44.583
Okay, help me.

07:44.584 --> 07:46.551
Can you do that?

07:46.552 --> 07:48.119
Yeah, we can do that.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.020
Great.

07:49.021 --> 07:50.789
Now, as much as I hate

07:50.790 --> 07:53.124
to break up this party, I got
a meeting I got to go to.

07:53.125 --> 07:54.860
Oh, the venture capitalist?
Yeah.

07:54.861 --> 07:55.927
Okay.

07:55.928 --> 07:57.295
All right.

07:57.296 --> 07:59.464
Marty, don't fuck this up.

07:59.465 --> 08:01.233
We got a big finder's
fee coming from Carlson.

08:01.234 --> 08:03.235
Yeah. That's right, yep,
money that's essential

08:03.236 --> 08:04.236
to the dushkin brand.

08:04.237 --> 08:06.472
I would not do that to you.

08:06.473 --> 08:08.241
Come on, you're talking
to Marty kaan.

08:08.242 --> 08:10.110
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
the dushkin brand, right?

08:10.111 --> 08:12.245
That's what we should be
thinking about, okay?

08:12.246 --> 08:14.314
Let me hit you off with this
little club expansion thing.

08:14.315 --> 08:15.748
I can tell you for a fact...

08:15.749 --> 08:17.583
Clyde, been there, done that.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.052
Yeah, look, Clyde,
our heads aren't really

08:19.053 --> 08:21.054
into the whole club
thing right now. Right.

08:21.055 --> 08:23.322
Sounds like they're buried
pretty deep in snatch, Clyde.

08:23.323 --> 08:25.158
Mmm. That's why we like you, Jeannie.

08:25.159 --> 08:26.993
So we're gonna do a little lap

08:26.994 --> 08:28.995
around the office,
little focus group testing.

08:28.996 --> 08:30.664
Guys, honestly I think
you could spend your time better

08:30.665 --> 08:32.666
if we'd just sit down here
for 15 more minutes.

08:32.667 --> 08:35.503
I think you should give
snatch a chance.

08:35.504 --> 08:36.837
Let's go, Alex.

08:36.837 --> 08:39.405
Guys, Alex, hey, Alex,
honestly...

08:39.407 --> 08:42.174
Shitty you.

08:43.244 --> 08:45.245
Well...

08:45.246 --> 08:46.253
I don't know
what's more impressive.

08:47.481 --> 08:49.149
All the afterwork that a product

08:49.150 --> 08:52.252
like pussy cologne will bring
us-- julianne will love that--

08:52.253 --> 08:55.422
or, uh, the prestige.

08:55.423 --> 08:56.990
I can fix this.

08:56.991 --> 08:58.425
I can fix this.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:13.775 --> 09:15.342
It's...

09:15.343 --> 09:16.943
Forget it.

09:16.944 --> 09:18.678
How are you?

09:18.679 --> 09:22.515
Oh, I'm feeling, uh,
pretty old today, Jeannie.

09:22.516 --> 09:24.184
Yeah, I went to my

09:24.185 --> 09:27.854
30-year b school
reunion last night.

09:27.855 --> 09:29.956
Mm! Ran into

09:29.957 --> 09:32.058
uh, Karen Anderson there.

09:32.059 --> 09:33.660
Do you know who she is?

09:33.661 --> 09:35.729
Ceo of demark consulting
in New York?

09:35.730 --> 09:37.164
That's right.

09:38.833 --> 09:41.401
<i>She is also the most
passive-aggressive narcissist</i>

09:41.402 --> 09:43.137
you will ever meet.

09:43.138 --> 09:44.838
Okay.

09:44.839 --> 09:46.640
And she was implying,
in her usual

09:46.641 --> 09:50.044
smug fucking way,

09:50.045 --> 09:52.546
that one of my gals
is making a move.

09:54.316 --> 09:56.083
I don't know.

09:56.084 --> 09:59.353
I mean, maybe that was just
chardonnay-fueled bullshit...

09:59.354 --> 10:03.357
Julianne, I have no intention
of making a move to demark,

10:03.358 --> 10:07.261
or... anywhere... else.

10:08.530 --> 10:10.564
Good.

10:12.167 --> 10:14.001
Good!

10:14.002 --> 10:16.037
Can you explain
something to me?

10:16.038 --> 10:20.108
Why does everyone
get their panties wet

10:20.109 --> 10:22.177
over fuckin' New York, huh?

10:22.178 --> 10:23.446
I mean, the weather

10:23.447 --> 10:25.848
is shit,
the streets smell like...

10:25.849 --> 10:27.249
You know, well, they-they... they...

10:27.250 --> 10:28.684
Phew. Well...

10:28.685 --> 10:30.352
You have no argument here.

10:30.353 --> 10:32.355
I think New York is a cesspool
of, you know, hipsters

10:32.356 --> 10:35.057
and hypocrites.

10:35.058 --> 10:36.692
Just the thought of New York,

10:36.693 --> 10:39.595
and I am dry
as the mojave down there.

10:39.596 --> 10:42.098
I am glad to hear that.

10:44.034 --> 10:46.402
Oh, God. I just... I...

10:46.403 --> 10:50.372
Do not understand people who
think they can fuck me over

10:50.373 --> 10:52.741
and get away with it.

11:01.884 --> 11:03.719
Marty.

11:03.720 --> 11:05.454
Hey, Mr. Carlson.

11:05.455 --> 11:07.389
Oh, now it's Mr. Carlson.

11:07.390 --> 11:08.223
Well, you know...

11:08.224 --> 11:10.125
Wah! Whoa! Oh.

11:11.494 --> 11:12.293
Come on, get in.

11:12.294 --> 11:13.728
Look, um...

11:13.729 --> 11:15.664
Can we just drop
all the bullshit between us?

11:15.665 --> 11:17.266
Let's go to Vegas.

11:17.267 --> 11:19.101
Vegas?
Yes.

11:19.102 --> 11:21.270
Copy of the deal is
sitting on my desk.

11:21.271 --> 11:22.971
I'll sign it when I get there.

11:22.972 --> 11:24.406
Or...

11:24.407 --> 11:25.941
You could just
blow me off again.

11:28.745 --> 11:31.780
Uh... yeah, let's go to Vegas! Mm! Mm!

11:31.781 --> 11:33.749
Yes!

11:38.521 --> 11:40.155
Great.

11:40.156 --> 11:43.158
You, uh, got a jet gassed up
at van nuys or something?

11:43.159 --> 11:44.660
I do. I do.

11:46.296 --> 11:47.763
But let's drive.

11:47.764 --> 11:49.631
Hah! Give us a chance
to really connect.

11:49.632 --> 11:51.099
Yeah, man...

11:51.100 --> 11:53.202
So, tell me about
your childhood, Marty.

11:53.203 --> 11:54.670
Hey.

11:54.671 --> 11:56.538
Hey.
Hi.

11:56.539 --> 11:58.206
Do you mind?

11:58.207 --> 12:00.208
No.

12:03.712 --> 12:06.447
Well, you know, Jeannie,

12:06.448 --> 12:10.150
I once had a thing with my boss
that did not

12:10.151 --> 12:11.619
end well, so...

12:11.620 --> 12:13.787
Okay, um, I don't know
what Doug told you.

12:13.788 --> 12:15.956
Mm. I don't even know what
Doug thinks that he knows,

12:15.957 --> 12:18.558
but, um, nothing is going on
between Marty and me.

12:18.559 --> 12:20.527
Oh, no, I meant you and

12:20.528 --> 12:21.962
the rainmaker guy.

12:21.963 --> 12:23.897
Oh. But that is interesting.

12:23.898 --> 12:25.198
You and Marty.
That makes sense.

12:25.199 --> 12:27.300
Well, it doesn't make sense,
because

12:27.301 --> 12:28.668
it's not happening.

12:28.669 --> 12:31.538
Oh, God.
Tamara, 3:00.

12:31.539 --> 12:32.739
We hate her, correct?

12:32.740 --> 12:33.906
Honestly...

12:33.907 --> 12:35.408
Hey, Tamara!

12:35.409 --> 12:37.910
Good to see you!

12:37.911 --> 12:39.479
What a fake bitch.

12:39.480 --> 12:42.081
No wonder her husband left her

12:42.082 --> 12:43.849
for a job in New York.
I mean, right?

12:45.085 --> 12:47.420
I need to make a phone call.

12:47.421 --> 12:50.023
Oh, you don't need
to make an excuse to me.

12:50.024 --> 12:52.025
I'm not. I-I actually
need to make a phone call.

12:52.026 --> 12:54.894
It's okay. Honestly,
you're not my thing.

12:54.895 --> 12:57.096
You're cold,
you're a little boring--

12:57.097 --> 12:59.232
no offense--
but for some reason,

12:59.233 --> 13:00.933
this matters to Doug, and so,

13:00.934 --> 13:03.402
<i>we are going to
make the effort.</i>

13:03.403 --> 13:05.438
Okay?

13:05.439 --> 13:07.039
That's a pretty big sacrifice.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.508
Hanging out with me.

13:08.509 --> 13:12.778
But it sounds like
you really do love Doug, so...

13:12.779 --> 13:14.514
I do.

13:14.515 --> 13:16.682
Yeah.

13:16.683 --> 13:18.718
Ooh.

13:18.719 --> 13:20.553
I'll make
this in the other room.

13:20.554 --> 13:23.222
Oh?

13:29.762 --> 13:32.764
I love this place!

13:32.765 --> 13:35.700
You can scream as loud as you
want, and no one will hear.

13:37.636 --> 13:39.103
Well, here we are.

13:39.104 --> 13:40.905
Yeah, I see
you really went, uh...

13:40.906 --> 13:44.241
Rustic
with the office decor, huh?

13:51.383 --> 13:53.717
Marty?
Yeah?

13:53.718 --> 13:55.820
You ever feel like
you have a problem

13:55.821 --> 13:58.255
that you just can't
figure out how to solve?

13:58.256 --> 14:01.559
Uh... sometimes, sure.
So what do you do?

14:01.560 --> 14:03.494
What do I...?
I'm not sure I follow...

14:03.495 --> 14:05.429
Me-- I like to come out here.

14:05.430 --> 14:09.133
I find that the desert
really clears my head.

14:15.974 --> 14:18.409
Let's solve our problem, Marty,

14:18.410 --> 14:20.610
once and for all.

14:21.846 --> 14:24.581
Um...

14:34.659 --> 14:36.760
Gun works!

14:36.761 --> 14:39.996
Great shot! Yeah.

14:39.997 --> 14:43.433
: I'm gonna kill you in
your sleep, you fucking prick.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.872
Yeah.

14:49.873 --> 14:52.041
Did you know
that Tamara is taking a job

14:52.042 --> 14:53.810
with demark in New York?

14:53.811 --> 14:55.611
What the fuck
are you talking about?

14:55.612 --> 14:58.381
I just got off the phone
with a friend of mine,

14:58.382 --> 15:00.783
and he says it's a done deal.

15:00.784 --> 15:02.451
You get reception out here?

15:02.452 --> 15:04.654
I can't get shit.
Who's your provider?

15:07.691 --> 15:10.127
Are you there?

15:10.128 --> 15:12.529
I got to call you back.

15:19.970 --> 15:21.871
You see this rifle?
Yeah.

15:21.872 --> 15:24.707
Ernest Hemingway used
this to hunt elephants.

15:24.708 --> 15:27.309
No shit.
No shit.

15:27.310 --> 15:29.745
I outbid one of his grandkids
at an auction for it.

15:33.750 --> 15:35.418
So, uh, how do we do this?

15:35.419 --> 15:39.588
One shot, open sights.

15:39.589 --> 15:42.257
You hit the target,
we jump back in the hummer,

15:42.258 --> 15:45.060
we drive straight to Vegas,
and I sign those papers.

15:45.061 --> 15:47.329
What if I don't?

15:47.330 --> 15:49.698
No, Marty.

15:49.699 --> 15:52.734
Where would I be if I only
asked myself, "what if I don't?"

15:52.735 --> 15:55.370
You have to ask
yourself, "what if I do?"

15:57.773 --> 15:59.274
All right.

15:59.275 --> 16:01.042
Just feel it.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.378
One shot.

16:09.752 --> 16:11.419
Oh!

16:13.055 --> 16:15.190
Right? Feels great, right?

16:15.191 --> 16:17.760
Honestly, it feels
fucking great.

16:17.761 --> 16:19.628
Right. Yes.

16:19.629 --> 16:22.798
You know what, Mike?
Fuck the deal.

16:22.799 --> 16:24.933
Huh? Fuck the deal, fuck the papers.

16:24.934 --> 16:26.768
Let's just do this some more.
Can we do that?

16:26.769 --> 16:28.203
Are you serious? Yeah, I'm dead serious.

16:28.204 --> 16:29.605
Yes!
Great.

16:29.606 --> 16:30.973
And thank you for asking. Okay.

16:30.974 --> 16:32.408
Do you know what?
You know what?

16:32.409 --> 16:33.909
Can I go get another toy
out of the back, though?

16:33.910 --> 16:35.611
What? No, no, get
whatever you want.

16:35.612 --> 16:37.413
I saw something back there.
I just... I'm dying...

16:37.414 --> 16:39.582
No, grab anything you want.
Okay. Fucking great. Whoo!

16:51.061 --> 16:53.463
Whoo!

16:53.464 --> 16:55.832
It's beautiful!
Yeah!

17:01.773 --> 17:04.141
Hey.

17:04.142 --> 17:06.511
Marty?

17:06.512 --> 17:10.080
Marty?!

17:10.082 --> 17:11.616
You motherfucker!

17:11.617 --> 17:13.150
Enjoy your watermelon, asshole!

17:13.151 --> 17:15.319
Marty?!

17:15.319 --> 17:17.755
Marty, what...?!

17:22.094 --> 17:23.795
Fuck you, Marty!

17:23.796 --> 17:26.198
Fuck!

17:29.102 --> 17:31.371
So that's it, huh? I mean,
you wouldn't even just consider

17:31.372 --> 17:34.775
buying the broscaper junior
as a gift... for your nephew?

17:34.776 --> 17:36.109
You know, to properly

17:36.110 --> 17:38.311
coif the nether regions.
He's eight.

17:38.312 --> 17:39.513
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:39.514 --> 17:40.981
Broscaper junior.

17:40.982 --> 17:42.383
Hey, can I talk to
you for one second?

17:42.384 --> 17:43.984
I apologize.
No.

17:43.985 --> 17:45.286
No, you guys should
keep talking. Malcolm.

17:45.287 --> 17:46.654
You got this, man.
Close this deal.

17:46.655 --> 17:47.788
You got this.
She's gonna buy it.

17:47.789 --> 17:48.823
All right.
What's up, bud?

17:50.025 --> 17:52.961
You see what he's
trying to do, right?

17:52.962 --> 17:55.797
With this whole "let's
be p. Diddy" thing? Yeah.

17:55.798 --> 17:57.398
Wait. What's he doing?

17:57.399 --> 17:58.800
He's trying to marginalize you,

17:58.801 --> 18:00.168
because he's fucking jealous.

18:00.169 --> 18:02.171
But the clubs, war--

18:02.172 --> 18:04.806
that is what put
the dushkin name on the map.

18:04.807 --> 18:06.341
And you're the brains
behind that operation.

18:06.342 --> 18:08.076
Everyone fucking knows that. They do?

18:08.077 --> 18:09.578
Of course they do.
Are you kidding me?

18:09.579 --> 18:11.480
You're Simon, he's Garfunkel,

18:11.481 --> 18:13.482
and he's tired of it, so he's
trying to build his own thing.

18:13.483 --> 18:14.850
Look at him spraying
that shit around.

18:14.851 --> 18:16.251
What the fuck is he doing, man?

18:16.252 --> 18:18.020
He's trying
to make you Garfunkel.

18:18.021 --> 18:20.322
He's making me
fucking Garfunkel?

18:20.323 --> 18:21.724
I'm telling you.
Beauty.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.393
Who's Garfunkel?

18:23.394 --> 18:25.328
It's... a bad...
That's a bad ref...

18:25.329 --> 18:26.896
Nobody knows...
You're right.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.665
Nobody knows you're Garfunkel.
I apologize.

18:28.666 --> 18:31.267
Think about the stupid fucking
products he's throwing around.

18:31.268 --> 18:34.838
Pussy cologne?
Pussy cologne.

18:34.839 --> 18:38.409
Broscaper junior
for eight-year-olds?

18:38.410 --> 18:40.377
Man, they don't even have pubes.

18:40.378 --> 18:42.847
That's right, Alex.
They don't even have pubes.

18:42.848 --> 18:45.049
What are they gonna be shaving--
their skin fucking off?

18:45.050 --> 18:47.052
Oh. These are terrible, terrible ideas,

18:47.053 --> 18:48.520
and you knew that.

18:48.521 --> 18:50.189
See, I fucking knew
that you knew that.

18:50.190 --> 18:52.591
Man, I get that you
want to support him.

18:52.592 --> 18:55.761
I understand.
He's your brother, but...

18:55.762 --> 18:57.929
Are you really gonna let him
destroy everything

18:57.930 --> 19:00.366
that you worked
so fucking hard to build up

19:00.367 --> 19:02.735
just over some bullshit
power play?

19:06.807 --> 19:09.375
Hey, Kyle...
Come on.

19:09.376 --> 19:11.243
We're gonna hear Clyde's pitch.

19:11.244 --> 19:12.978
I gotta set up in here. It'll
take two seconds. All right.

19:12.979 --> 19:14.981
Let's do this.
She wanted some snatch.

19:14.982 --> 19:18.285
Come on. Do you want some money,
though? This better be fucking good.

19:28.662 --> 19:30.630
Hey.

19:30.631 --> 19:33.300
Hey. Listen,
the Carlson deal's on hold.

19:33.301 --> 19:34.768
Fuck.

19:34.769 --> 19:36.503
Why do you always assume
it's a bad thing?

19:36.504 --> 19:38.839
Has daddy ever let you
down before? Well...

19:38.840 --> 19:40.775
Don't answer that.
Look, I may also

19:40.776 --> 19:43.478
need you to run point
on the paperwork with my lawyer.

19:43.479 --> 19:46.147
Okay.
Is Tamara in the loop yet?

19:46.148 --> 19:48.917
She's not a concern
of mine anymore.

19:48.918 --> 19:50.318
What does that mean?

19:50.319 --> 19:51.954
It means she's not my concern.

19:51.955 --> 19:53.121
Uh, I gotta go.

19:59.029 --> 20:01.030
Mr. pincus.
Marty.

20:01.031 --> 20:02.298
It's been a while.
Yeah.

20:02.299 --> 20:03.533
What can I do for you?

20:03.534 --> 20:05.535
Well, uh...

20:05.536 --> 20:07.604
You can give me
your word that, uh,

20:07.605 --> 20:09.873
all the afterwork will go
through my new company

20:09.874 --> 20:11.509
after we make this deal.

20:13.545 --> 20:14.712
What deal are we making?

20:14.713 --> 20:15.847
Online gambling.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.782
The deal I already said no to.

20:17.783 --> 20:19.617
That's right. Jesus,
Marty, you're relentless.

20:19.618 --> 20:22.620
So is Michael Carlson.

20:22.621 --> 20:25.356
Who's parlaying the money
he'll make on online gaming

20:25.357 --> 20:27.625
to strengthen his stranglehold
on the strip.

20:27.626 --> 20:30.627
It's a lot of alliteration,
isn't it? I know.

20:30.628 --> 20:32.496
Allow me to illuminate.

20:32.497 --> 20:34.865
Now, the casinos in red,

20:34.866 --> 20:37.000
those are the ones
Michael Carlson already owns.

20:37.001 --> 20:39.670
The ones in blue he can't touch
because they're thriving--

20:39.671 --> 20:41.405
caesars being the king
of that hill

20:41.406 --> 20:43.074
because of their
online poker presence.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.408
But the green ones,
Mr. pincus,

20:44.409 --> 20:45.743
the green ones,

20:45.744 --> 20:47.344
they're vulnerable,

20:47.345 --> 20:49.346
struggling to survive.

20:49.347 --> 20:51.348
And those are the ones
that Michael Carlson

20:51.349 --> 20:53.317
is going to try to acquire.

20:53.318 --> 20:54.985
See that one there?

20:54.986 --> 20:57.388
That's you.

20:57.389 --> 20:59.823
Marty, no one's acquiring me,

20:59.824 --> 21:01.992
least of all fucking Carlson.

21:01.993 --> 21:03.660
I...

21:03.661 --> 21:05.495
I'm rebuilding.

21:05.496 --> 21:07.497
Just waiting on those
zoning permits, right?

21:09.167 --> 21:11.134
They should've come through
by now, though.

21:13.405 --> 21:17.007
Mr. pincus, have you heard
of the name Samuel walterman?

21:17.008 --> 21:18.942
How about Daniel Lopez?

21:18.943 --> 21:21.778
They're on the city council.

21:21.779 --> 21:23.614
How many city councilmen
do you have

21:23.615 --> 21:25.082
on the speed dial
of your phone?

21:25.083 --> 21:28.285
Because Michael Carlson
has at least two.

21:28.286 --> 21:30.087
Carlson's
phone? Where did you get that?

21:30.088 --> 21:33.089
He left it in his car.

21:33.090 --> 21:36.593
Hey, Mike.
What can I do for you?

21:36.594 --> 21:39.095
Hey, you know where I can bury
a dead hooker, Danny?

21:39.096 --> 21:40.296
Uh, it's gonna cost you.

21:41.431 --> 21:42.932
Oh.

21:42.933 --> 21:45.468
Sounded really chummy,
didn't he?

21:45.469 --> 21:47.936
Now, how much are you willing
to bet that Michael Carlson

21:47.937 --> 21:49.638
pulled a lot of strings
to make sure

21:49.639 --> 21:51.073
that your paperwork
didn't go through,

21:51.074 --> 21:53.475
try to force you into selling?

21:53.476 --> 21:57.111
Mr. pincus, you said online
gaming didn't excite you,

21:57.112 --> 21:59.113
but fucking over
Michael Carlson

21:59.114 --> 22:01.815
and making a boatload
of money in the process,

22:01.816 --> 22:03.984
all while polishing the emerald

22:03.985 --> 22:07.954
to a high sheen-- that has got
to be pretty fucking exciting.

22:13.460 --> 22:15.795
I'm in. Can I have that?

22:17.831 --> 22:20.466
Whoo!
Do you see it, baby?

22:20.467 --> 22:23.836
Oh, my God! What is that
smell? Did you see it?

22:23.837 --> 22:27.273
Oh! Oh, Clyde, at least
keep the door open.

22:27.274 --> 22:29.909
God, what is it? I can...
I can almost taste it.

22:29.910 --> 22:31.644
Oh.
Oh, you guys

22:31.645 --> 22:33.346
must be allergic
to the smell of victory

22:33.347 --> 22:34.847
because the dushkin twins

22:34.848 --> 22:37.283
loved my fucking pitch.
Now, they don't know

22:37.284 --> 22:39.118
where the hell Barcelona is,

22:39.119 --> 22:40.519
but they cannot wait

22:40.520 --> 22:42.588
to open up a club there,
and that is because

22:42.589 --> 22:44.657
of me.
Clyde...

22:44.658 --> 22:47.093
Take a beat before...

22:47.094 --> 22:48.494
Before what, huh?

22:48.495 --> 22:50.330
Before the dushkin twins
start writing some

22:50.331 --> 22:51.698
fat fucking checks
to galweather stearn?

22:51.699 --> 22:53.166
Is that what I'm...
What am I waiting for?

22:53.167 --> 22:54.501
I don't understand.

22:54.502 --> 22:56.202
No, I'm just saying
that the Carlson deal

22:56.203 --> 22:57.504
is not even closed yet.

22:57.505 --> 22:59.339
Oh, I see. It...

22:59.340 --> 23:01.541
Am I detecting
some sour grapes, Jeannie?

23:01.542 --> 23:03.810
You afraid that I'm sucking
some of the wattage

23:03.811 --> 23:06.112
from your star power?
Is that what it is?

23:06.113 --> 23:08.114
You know what?
You're right, Clyde.

23:08.115 --> 23:10.784
I'm-I'm sure it'll go off
without a hi...

23:10.785 --> 23:12.352
Without a hitch.

23:12.353 --> 23:13.887
Congratulations.
I'm gonna burn this.

23:13.888 --> 23:15.388
I'm gonna burn this suit.

23:15.389 --> 23:17.957
I'm gonna burn this suit!

23:17.958 --> 23:19.859
Oh, hey. Um, you know,

23:19.860 --> 23:21.861
Sarah told me that you guys
had a really nice chat.

23:21.862 --> 23:23.529
Hmm?

23:23.530 --> 23:24.664
She's great, right?

23:24.665 --> 23:28.167
Doug, Sarah is...

23:30.903 --> 23:34.038
Sh-she really, really
cares about you.

23:34.039 --> 23:36.040
I know.
It's crazy, right?

23:36.041 --> 23:39.010
For two people
to have what we have?

23:39.011 --> 23:41.713
God, I just love her.

23:45.751 --> 23:48.586
Oh, look who comes home.
Hey, pop.

23:48.587 --> 23:50.555
Uh, well, you're just
in time because...

23:50.556 --> 23:51.990
I was about to make

23:51.991 --> 23:54.159
my move
on your beautiful visitor.

23:55.395 --> 23:57.196
Mm-hmm.

23:57.197 --> 23:58.931
What?

23:58.932 --> 24:00.732
Nice meeting you, Tamara!

24:03.936 --> 24:05.370
Not good?

24:05.371 --> 24:07.405
Eh. Not unless you
like evil bitches.

24:07.406 --> 24:08.372
Oh, shit.

24:09.908 --> 24:11.208
What the fuck, Marty?

24:11.209 --> 24:12.843
I know, I know, I know. Sorry.

24:12.844 --> 24:14.278
Hey, what-what are
you doing here?

24:14.279 --> 24:15.946
What am I doing here?

24:15.947 --> 24:18.381
I waited for you
for almost two hours.

24:18.382 --> 24:20.550
I know. I called your
phone, you didn't answer.

24:20.551 --> 24:22.052
I got worried. I've been... listen,

24:22.053 --> 24:23.954
I was on a plane... yeah. Thank you.

24:23.955 --> 24:26.223
Back from Vegas.

24:26.224 --> 24:29.226
Deal is done.
What?

24:29.227 --> 24:32.229
Are you kidding me?
I know. No.

24:32.230 --> 24:33.563
Oh, honey.

24:33.564 --> 24:35.031
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

24:35.032 --> 24:36.967
I told you we'd be
celebrating tonight.

24:36.968 --> 24:38.035
I know.

24:38.036 --> 24:39.936
Doing the unspeakable.
Mmm.

24:43.408 --> 24:44.975
You know, she didn't
even tell him.

24:44.976 --> 24:46.610
That is so fucked up.

24:46.611 --> 24:48.245
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Right?

24:48.246 --> 24:50.815
I mean, I'm not saying
Marty's, like, an angel

24:50.816 --> 24:52.584
or anything... if you want to leave
your husband, uh-uh. He's not an angel.

24:52.585 --> 24:54.552
Go back to your husband.
Just own it okay, okay.

24:54.553 --> 24:56.054
And be a decent, fucking human.

24:56.055 --> 24:57.622
Can we maybe not discuss

24:57.623 --> 24:59.290
your boss's love life
right at this moment?

24:59.291 --> 25:01.326
You don't like talking
during sex-- I get it.

25:01.327 --> 25:03.628
No, I like talking a lot.
I do. I just, you know...

25:03.629 --> 25:05.830
Would you prefer
that I blow you and just...

25:05.831 --> 25:07.598
Keep my mouth occupied?

25:07.599 --> 25:09.233
Why are you picking a fight
with me? I'm not picking

25:09.234 --> 25:10.835
<i>- a fight with you.
- Let's get to it,</i>

25:10.836 --> 25:12.303
baby.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

25:12.304 --> 25:13.771
Little wrinkle. Um...

25:13.772 --> 25:17.074
I took the deal...
Mm-hmm.

25:17.075 --> 25:19.644
To pincus.

25:19.645 --> 25:21.645
Yeah.
It's gonna be a big piece

25:21.646 --> 25:23.514
of business
for kaan and associates.

25:23.515 --> 25:25.149
It's gonna be a game-changer,
really. But, Marty,

25:25.150 --> 25:27.150
I'm-I'm totally confused
because you know

25:27.151 --> 25:28.985
how important this deal was. Yeah,
how much you had riding on it.

25:28.986 --> 25:30.286
That deal was, like, everything
to me. Yes, I understand.

25:30.287 --> 25:33.523
You made that very clear.

25:41.266 --> 25:44.869
I was gonna tell you
about my job at demark. I was.

25:44.870 --> 25:47.038
Yeah, well, guess
somebody beat you to it.

25:47.039 --> 25:49.640
Yeah, clearly. Let me guess.

25:49.641 --> 25:53.845
Was it, um, I don't know,
was it Jeannie?

25:53.846 --> 25:55.847
Is something going on
with you and Marty?

25:57.350 --> 25:58.650
No. We're not...

25:58.651 --> 26:01.120
I mean, we're not...

26:01.121 --> 26:02.989
If that's what you're asking.
That's not what I'm asking.

26:02.990 --> 26:04.991
Just seemed like...

26:04.992 --> 26:08.162
Until today,
you were really happy.

26:08.163 --> 26:10.064
I thought things were good.

26:10.065 --> 26:12.967
They are.

26:12.968 --> 26:16.070
They were.

26:16.071 --> 26:18.506
You know, Marty, we could've
talked about this like adults.

26:18.507 --> 26:21.843
Yeah, but this just
seemed so right.

26:23.145 --> 26:25.312
I'm sorry
if I hurt your feelings.

26:25.313 --> 26:29.817
Don't... Tamara, you fucked me
over, okay? No, I am. That is...

26:29.818 --> 26:32.320
You-you-you played me.

26:32.321 --> 26:35.924
You're so great, Nate.

26:35.925 --> 26:38.493
I mean, you're truly amazing.
Are you breaking up with me?

26:38.494 --> 26:40.729
I don't... I don't think
you should.

26:42.098 --> 26:44.599
I don't think I should either.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.201
So don't.

26:46.202 --> 26:47.602
<i>Really?</i>

26:47.603 --> 26:49.438
I fucked you?

26:49.439 --> 26:52.274
Marty, how far did you think
this thing was gonna go?

26:52.275 --> 26:55.444
You think I don't know
who you are?

26:56.713 --> 27:01.049
I know exactly
who Marty kaan is.

27:06.522 --> 27:10.224
I'm sorry.

27:17.365 --> 27:19.366
Hey. Yeah.

27:19.367 --> 27:21.369
It's me. Listen.

27:21.370 --> 27:24.806
Get everybody together and meet
me at the office in 20 minutes.

27:40.923 --> 27:42.891
Kiddies.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.595
Take a good look around.

27:48.931 --> 27:51.333
Soak it all in.

27:51.334 --> 27:54.636
Because, by this time tomorrow,
we don't work here anymore.
