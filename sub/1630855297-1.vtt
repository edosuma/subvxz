01:43.718 --> 01:46.155
Well, you see, the government
tries to curb inflation

01:46.189 --> 01:47.559
by raising interest rates,

01:47.592 --> 01:50.531
so that people borrow less
and spend less.

01:50.565 --> 01:52.769
Okay, so if prices are
going up, can we get a raise?

01:52.802 --> 01:53.804
-(phone ringing)
-No, well, you see,

01:53.838 --> 01:55.273
if I raise your wages,

01:55.307 --> 01:56.577
-then you'd have more money.
-Yeah.

01:56.610 --> 01:57.779

is not good.

-CHARLIE: No.

02:02.388 --> 02:03.323
-to increase, right?
-No.

02:03.356 --> 02:04.693

02:04.726 --> 02:06.195
need to do is lower
our wages. I get it.

06:52.702 --> 06:54.471
All right. Jesus.

06:54.506 --> 06:56.208
I need a place to stay.
Let me talk to Frank.

06:56.242 --> 06:58.046
-What's on your hand?
-It's a piece of a door.

06:58.079 --> 06:59.114
-Move past it. Frank!
-He can't hear you,

06:59.148 --> 07:00.885
he's in the other room, okay?

07:00.918 --> 07:02.054
What? What other room?

07:02.087 --> 07:03.691
Frank! Dee's here!

07:03.724 --> 07:04.659
I mean, I'm gonna have
to get, like, an intercom

07:04.693 --> 07:06.597
on the wall or something.

07:06.630 --> 07:08.066
-It's just totally nuts.
-What? What is
going on over here?

07:08.099 --> 07:09.769
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just...
(groans)

07:09.803 --> 07:11.172
-Holy shit, Charlie.
-Yeah.

07:11.205 --> 07:13.611
This is tits. Why don't
you use this room?

07:13.644 --> 07:15.113
I like to keep my life simple.

07:15.146 --> 07:16.783
I don't want to live
in a maze, you know?

07:16.817 --> 07:18.821
No. I don't know.
Can I sleep in here?

07:18.854 --> 07:20.223
Absolutely not.
Don't think about that.

07:20.256 --> 07:21.827
-(knock on door)
-Someone's at the door again.

07:21.860 --> 07:23.631
Okay? I'm gonna
have to walk another mile.

07:23.664 --> 07:25.166
This is crazy. I mean,
I'm gonna have to get a butler.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.106
-(knocking)
-(groans) I'm coming, hang on.

07:29.609 --> 07:31.112
-What?
-Where's Frank?

07:31.145 --> 07:33.149
-Why?
-We don't have to
tell you our business.

07:33.182 --> 07:34.552
Fine, whatever.
He's in the other room.

07:34.586 --> 07:35.655
What other room?

07:35.688 --> 07:36.556
The other room over there, man.

07:36.590 --> 07:37.558
That's where he is.

07:37.592 --> 07:38.827
You have another room here?

07:38.861 --> 07:40.463
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I got another room.

07:40.498 --> 07:41.900
-What the hell, dude?
-MAC: What's going on?

07:41.933 --> 07:43.537
I mean, we're gonna
blow our shoes out

07:43.570 --> 07:44.806
with all this walking, man.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.576
Holy shit.

07:46.610 --> 07:48.046
-What the hell?
-I mean, Charlie,

07:48.079 --> 07:49.114
have you always had this?

07:49.148 --> 07:50.551
Yeah, it's not a big deal.

07:50.584 --> 07:52.054
How is this not a big deal?

07:52.087 --> 07:53.489
Wait, so you truly
have no reason

07:53.524 --> 07:54.659
to be sleeping with Frank.

07:55.928 --> 07:58.166
Move past it, dude.
Move past it, man.

07:58.199 --> 07:59.869
I will move past it

07:59.903 --> 08:01.540
because I really, ultimately,
don't give a shit.

08:01.573 --> 08:02.942
Frank, listen,

08:02.975 --> 08:04.011
we have an incredible
business opportunity

08:04.044 --> 08:05.213
we want to talk to you about.

08:05.246 --> 08:06.983
All right, well,
let's talk turkey.

08:07.017 --> 08:08.587
What, you're gonna listen
to their idea over mine, dude?

08:08.620 --> 08:10.725
L-Look, the two of you,
get out of here.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.628
I need the office. Get out.

08:12.662 --> 08:15.133
Oh, now it's an office?
It's an office now?

08:15.166 --> 08:17.170
Oh, that's great. I mean,
are we even zoned for that?

08:17.204 --> 08:20.043
-I'll come back tonight.
-(frustrated shout)

08:26.255 --> 08:28.994
-(furniture squeaking)
-Yeah, so, uh,
what do you think, Frank?

08:29.028 --> 08:31.132
Good, good. It's got
a nice squeak to it.

08:31.165 --> 08:33.537
Yeah, it does have a nice
squeak to it, doesn't it?

08:33.570 --> 08:35.541
Hey, uh, Mac, you almost done
with that one over there, bud?

08:35.574 --> 08:38.112
Yeah, just finishing up.
And I am

08:38.146 --> 08:40.050
good. (coughs)

08:40.083 --> 08:41.720
That's a lot of blowing.

08:41.753 --> 08:43.022
(chuckles) Now, Frank,

08:43.056 --> 08:43.991
would you like
to start this meeting off

08:44.024 --> 08:45.628
with a Fancy Nut?

08:45.661 --> 08:47.097
What happened to your lips?

08:47.130 --> 08:48.266
Huh?

08:48.299 --> 08:49.736
What happened to your lips?

08:49.769 --> 08:51.205
Oh, this must...
must be from the plastic.

08:51.238 --> 08:53.176
It's, uh, it's probably
from all the blowing.

08:53.209 --> 08:54.278
-(chuckles)
-Blowing.

08:54.311 --> 08:55.848
The-- the plastic on these

08:55.881 --> 08:57.317
is a little bit irritating.

08:57.350 --> 08:59.088
It's not the pla...
No, that's not what it is.

08:59.121 --> 09:00.591
That's not what it is.

09:00.624 --> 09:01.893
(gags, groans)

09:01.927 --> 09:03.296
That is rancid.

09:03.329 --> 09:05.033
Did you g...
Did you get a bad one?

09:05.066 --> 09:07.605
Well, they're all bad.
Do not eat them.

09:07.638 --> 09:09.776
Okay? Either of you.

09:09.809 --> 09:11.345
Now, Frank, as we all know,

09:11.378 --> 09:14.084
we're living in
a time of inflation.

09:14.118 --> 09:15.721
But...

09:15.755 --> 09:18.259
is inflation such a bad thing?

09:18.292 --> 09:20.631
Or are things

09:20.664 --> 09:23.236
better inflated?

09:24.672 --> 09:26.175
Take it. (grunts)

09:27.779 --> 09:29.181
Take a look at
that lookbook there.

09:29.214 --> 09:30.918
Turn to the first page,
you'll see, uh...

09:30.951 --> 09:32.020
Hello.

09:32.053 --> 09:33.924
DENNIS (chuckles):
Yeah.

09:33.957 --> 09:37.230
Kim Kardashian's backside,
the early years.

09:37.264 --> 09:38.867
Now, if you turn
to the next page...

09:42.073 --> 09:44.011
-Oh.
-Yeah.

09:44.044 --> 09:45.213
(laughs)

09:45.246 --> 09:48.386
-Ooh. Ooh.
-Yes. Yes.

09:48.419 --> 09:50.390
As the years have gone by,

09:50.423 --> 09:52.995
her backside has gotten bigger
and bigger. It's inflated.

09:53.029 --> 09:54.866
MAC (muffled):
I think what you'll find

09:54.899 --> 09:57.772
most interesting is that
the Kardashians' net worth

09:57.805 --> 10:00.945
has inflated in direct
proportion to their booties.

10:02.280 --> 10:04.218
What did he say?

10:04.251 --> 10:05.855
I'm saying that
the Kardashians'...

10:05.888 --> 10:07.625
-No, no, Mac, Mac, please.
-...backsides....

10:07.658 --> 10:08.994
Just let me.

10:09.027 --> 10:10.965
Let me, okay? Okay, uh, Frank,

10:10.998 --> 10:14.004
we would like for you to, um,

10:14.037 --> 10:17.879
inject some capital into
our inflatable furniture...

10:17.912 --> 10:19.749
I'm in. Yeah.

10:19.782 --> 10:21.051
-DENNIS: You're in?
-Yeah.

10:21.085 --> 10:22.688
You... Oh, really?

10:22.722 --> 10:23.891
You-you don't need to
hear the whole pitch?

10:23.924 --> 10:25.728
Nah, I'll give you the money,

10:25.761 --> 10:28.032
but it's a loan, and you got
to pay me back with interest.

10:28.065 --> 10:30.270
-Oh, we like interest.
That's great.
-Yeah, no problem.

10:30.303 --> 10:32.007
And I want to keep the
furniture for the room.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.276
You want to keep this?
Yeah, sure.

10:33.309 --> 10:34.913
And I want to
keep the book for...

10:34.946 --> 10:36.415
other reasons.

10:36.448 --> 10:38.119
Yeah, we-we-we figured

10:38.152 --> 10:39.756
-you'd want to...
-Oh, okay, you're gonna...

10:39.789 --> 10:41.392
It's crazy. I can be,
like, a good businessman.

10:41.425 --> 10:43.262
You know, I don't know why
he doesn't take me seriously.

10:43.296 --> 10:45.099
It's like, do you have
any idea how much time

10:45.133 --> 10:47.237
I've spent, like, tracking
and researching the price

10:47.270 --> 10:48.874
-of this online currency?
-That's got to be maddening.

10:48.907 --> 10:50.310
Did you glue your
hand to my door?

10:50.343 --> 10:51.913
-Yeah, I did.
-Why?

10:51.947 --> 10:53.449
Well, it's a new form
of protest, Charlie.

10:53.482 --> 10:55.086
People are doing it
to, you know,

10:55.119 --> 10:57.257
call attention to injustices
or some shit.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.259
I don't know.
Either way, I'm locked in.

10:58.292 --> 11:00.296
(sighs) Uh, boom.

11:00.330 --> 11:02.835
Just like that,
we are in business.

11:02.869 --> 11:04.137
He went with your idea?

11:04.171 --> 11:05.106
(lisping):
Of course he did, Charlie,

11:05.139 --> 11:07.043
we are savvy businessmen.

11:07.077 --> 11:08.680
What's going on with Mac's lips?

11:08.714 --> 11:10.149
I-I don't know,
they're insane. It's-it's...

11:10.183 --> 11:11.753
I think a little bit of
the plastic is, uh...

11:11.786 --> 11:14.057
Probably from all the blowing
he's been doing.

11:14.091 --> 11:15.728
(laughs) He's been making
homophobic jokes...

11:15.761 --> 11:16.730
Not homophobic.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.099
Uh, FYI,

11:18.132 --> 11:19.401
Frank, uh, does not
want to be bothered

11:19.434 --> 11:20.905
in there for
a little bit, you know,

11:20.938 --> 11:22.407
he's... he's... Well, you know.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.344
-He's jacking off
into a magazine.
-Right.

11:24.378 --> 11:25.346
Aw.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.883
DEE:
Oh.

11:26.917 --> 11:28.987
(furniture squeaking)

11:29.021 --> 11:30.423
(groans)

11:43.817 --> 11:46.890
Look, Charlie,
I can tell you're mad.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.727
Well, it's just like,
I don't get it, man.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.463
It's like, why do you believe
in Mac and Dennis over me?

11:50.497 --> 11:52.434
Look, Charlie, I'm not
investing in them

11:52.467 --> 11:54.304
because I believe in them.

11:54.338 --> 11:57.010
I'm investing in them
because I don't believe in them.

11:57.043 --> 11:59.348
They're gonna be paying me money
for the rest of their lives,

11:59.381 --> 12:02.087
like that stupid couch.

12:02.120 --> 12:04.091
-Well, then you're just,
like, being a predator.
-Exactly.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.159
Well, it's not
a compliment, Frank.

12:05.193 --> 12:06.161
You know what?

12:06.195 --> 12:07.899
I can't deal with this.

12:07.932 --> 12:11.773
I'm going to go sleep in
the other bedroom, all right?

12:11.806 --> 12:14.177
What? And just leave
me here, all alone?

12:14.211 --> 12:15.781
Yes, yes.

12:15.814 --> 12:18.052
DEE:
I'm still here, goddamn it.

12:19.121 --> 12:20.925
Charlie, can you
please unglue me?

12:20.958 --> 12:22.193
I got to go to the new bathroom.

12:22.227 --> 12:24.431
No, Dee, you
did this to yourself.

12:24.464 --> 12:26.435
I will glue a pillow
to the wall, though.

12:26.468 --> 12:28.807
-I don't want to be a bad host.
-Oh, yeah?

12:28.840 --> 12:31.780
(Mac wheezing)

12:40.363 --> 12:42.334
You know what, man?
This was a mistake.

12:42.367 --> 12:43.937
I-I can't sleep.

12:43.971 --> 12:45.908
Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:45.941 --> 12:47.845
You're upset and concerned

12:47.878 --> 12:50.183
that we got rid of
our furniture too soon.

12:50.216 --> 12:51.987
Nope, that's not it.

12:52.020 --> 12:53.255
Is it the business plan?

12:53.289 --> 12:54.224
You're afraid
it's not gonna work?

12:54.257 --> 12:55.861
That's also not it.

12:55.894 --> 12:57.999
-Then what?
-It's your goddamn wheezing.

12:58.032 --> 12:59.201
Am I wheezing?

12:59.234 --> 13:00.871
Are you wheezing?
You sound insane.

13:00.904 --> 13:02.140
Are you allergic to those nuts?

13:02.173 --> 13:04.111
No. It's not the nuts.

13:04.144 --> 13:07.217
I... It's... I, uh... I think
it's from blowing up those...

13:07.250 --> 13:08.820
No. Okay, also, I feel

13:08.854 --> 13:10.256
like I'm sleeping
in a tub of nuts here, man.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.926
-Can you
stop eating them in bed?
-(knocking)

13:11.960 --> 13:13.229
-It's Charlie! Open up-- oh.
-Oh, Charlie's here.

13:13.262 --> 13:14.231
-Stop eating the nuts.
-It's unlocked.

13:14.264 --> 13:15.801
You should lock your door.

13:15.834 --> 13:18.139
Look, I need a place to stay.

13:18.172 --> 13:21.245
-(weakly): No room.
-What?

13:21.278 --> 13:22.882
-We don't have...
-He's-he's...

13:22.915 --> 13:24.418
...any room.

13:24.451 --> 13:26.388
He's saying
we don't have any room.

13:26.422 --> 13:29.027
But, uh, well, hey, I can,
I can blow up my own bed

13:29.061 --> 13:30.396
and I can deflate it
in the morning.

13:30.430 --> 13:31.499
I'll inflate it,
I'll deflate it.

13:31.533 --> 13:32.868
It'll be like I was never here.

13:32.902 --> 13:34.137
Plus, I brought my own nuts.

13:34.171 --> 13:35.541
(wheezing):
Are they fancy?

13:35.574 --> 13:36.910
What? What-what is he saying?

13:36.943 --> 13:38.112
Are they Fancy Nuts?

13:38.145 --> 13:39.515
He wants to know
if they're fancy.

13:39.549 --> 13:41.118
Well, some are, yeah.
It's an assortment.

13:41.151 --> 13:42.588
Consider it an offering.

13:42.621 --> 13:44.191
Of war?

13:44.224 --> 13:45.961
Of peace. What is going
on with you, dude?

13:45.995 --> 13:47.965
He's allergic to nuts, okay?
I think he's gonna die.

13:47.999 --> 13:50.169
I'm not allergic to nuts.

13:50.203 --> 13:51.405
The point is, Charlie,
we can't swing it.

13:51.438 --> 13:53.442
Well, I have information
about Frank

13:53.476 --> 13:55.848
that you guys might like
to hear for your business.

13:59.287 --> 14:01.425
-Fine. Tell us.
-(wheezing): Have-have a seat.

14:01.458 --> 14:03.162
Okay.

14:04.431 --> 14:06.301
Here's how this works.

14:06.335 --> 14:08.205
Cut me in on your operation,

14:08.239 --> 14:10.577
and I'll give you
the information.

14:10.611 --> 14:13.315
See? I am a pretty good
businessman after all.

14:15.486 --> 14:17.323
Okay, Charlie, you're just
trying to bribe us,

14:17.357 --> 14:20.163
and bartering with nuts that you
probably foraged from a tree.

14:20.196 --> 14:22.233
Mmm, some are from a tree, yes.

14:24.104 --> 14:25.908
A fancy tree?

14:25.941 --> 14:27.945
One of the fanciest, Mac.

14:27.978 --> 14:31.018
Which one?

14:32.087 --> 14:34.157
You ever have a pine nut?

14:34.191 --> 14:35.426
-Just give us
the information, please.
-(wheezing): Which one is...?

14:35.460 --> 14:37.330
Fine.

14:37.363 --> 14:39.234
But first I want you guys
to hear about my business idea.

14:39.267 --> 14:42.575
No. You can stay here
one night, okay?

14:42.608 --> 14:44.478
But I don't want to hear
your goddamn business idea

14:44.512 --> 14:46.115
'cause I don't care.
Now tell us the Frank thing.

14:46.148 --> 14:47.383
Fine.

14:47.417 --> 14:48.987
Frank only lent
you guys the money

14:49.020 --> 14:50.958
'cause he thinks
you're gonna fail.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.028
In fact, he wants you to fail.

14:53.062 --> 14:56.201
See, he's what you would
call a predatory lender,

14:56.235 --> 14:58.907
and he's simply taking
advantage of you guys.

14:58.940 --> 15:01.311
-Son of a bi... Son of...
-Okay, okay.

15:01.345 --> 15:02.915
-All right, stop-stop talking.
-Son of a bitch.

15:02.948 --> 15:05.319
-Just stop-stop talking.
I get it.
-Frank.

15:05.353 --> 15:08.493
This is a classic
inflation-interest play.

15:08.527 --> 15:09.962
But I'll tell you something,

15:09.996 --> 15:11.064
Frank's not the only one

15:11.098 --> 15:12.501
who can be a predatory lender.

15:12.535 --> 15:14.505
I say we pivot.

15:14.539 --> 15:17.978
I say we don't sell people
these inflatables.

15:18.012 --> 15:19.649
We rent them to them.

15:21.118 --> 15:24.892
(wheezing)

15:31.673 --> 15:35.113
Well... he's hanging on.

15:35.146 --> 15:36.649
Doesn't sound like it.

15:36.683 --> 15:38.085
(Mac wheezing)

15:38.119 --> 15:40.123
Ow, ow.

15:40.156 --> 15:41.559
Rise and shine, Dee.

15:41.593 --> 15:43.697
-What time is it?
-It's 4:00 in the morning.

15:43.730 --> 15:45.667
We got to go. We got work to do.

15:45.701 --> 15:48.372
Just grab anything small.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.577
Lamps are good 'cause
they're easy to run with.

15:50.611 --> 15:52.380
Hold on a second.
Are we robbing this place?

15:52.413 --> 15:53.415
-Huh?
-Hey!

15:53.449 --> 15:54.719
What the hell are you doing?

15:54.752 --> 15:56.021
You haven't paid your rent

15:56.054 --> 15:57.290
in three months, you deadbeat.

15:57.323 --> 15:58.693
You can't come in here
and take my shit.

15:58.727 --> 16:00.363
Oh, you want it back?
Well, then pay your rent.

16:00.396 --> 16:02.300
I'm getting my gun.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.572
Go for it, bitch!
We got bulletproof vests on!

16:04.605 --> 16:06.308
Oh, no, I don't. I don't
have a bulletproof vest.

16:06.341 --> 16:09.281
Relax, these guys are always
bluffing. Grab stuff.

16:09.314 --> 16:11.686
Frank, no. What is happening?
You're a slumlord now?

16:11.719 --> 16:13.690
Yes, I collect on these guys,

16:13.723 --> 16:15.326
and if they don't pay,

16:15.359 --> 16:17.030
I throw 'em out on the street,
like I did you.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.167
What? You're my landlord?

16:19.201 --> 16:22.307
Yeah, I got tired of paying
your rent all those years,

16:22.340 --> 16:24.010
so I bought the building.

16:24.044 --> 16:25.213
Why did you raise the rent?

16:25.246 --> 16:27.450
Inflation.
I got to increase my nut.

16:27.483 --> 16:29.555
-Goddamn it.
-Oh, he's hot.

16:29.589 --> 16:30.624
Oh, shit.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.126
Relax, they never shoot.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.329
(screams)

16:33.362 --> 16:34.999
Ah, time to go.

16:35.032 --> 16:37.638
Pay your rent, you deadbeat.

16:43.282 --> 16:45.119
Dennis, it's, like,

16:45.152 --> 16:47.056
I feel like we got to weigh
all this stuff down, man.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.660
Nah, it's fine, it's fine.

16:48.693 --> 16:50.797
Also, I got to talk to you about
this Internet money, dude,

16:50.831 --> 16:53.202
because this guy does not know
what he's sitting on, man.

16:53.235 --> 16:54.572
-He's a chump, dude...
-Charlie, Charlie.

16:54.605 --> 16:56.643
Stop trying to
talk business, all right?

16:56.676 --> 16:58.445
-It's just not your
strong suit, all right?
-Yeah, yeah. Okay.

16:58.479 --> 17:00.383
Oh, here comes a customer.
Here, let me do the talking.

17:00.416 --> 17:02.588
Hi, sir. Hi, how are you today?

17:02.621 --> 17:04.090
It's a lovely day, isn't it?

17:04.124 --> 17:06.295
-A little windy.
-A little breezy, yeah.

17:06.328 --> 17:08.199
Yeah, a little breezy.
But, uh, anyway,

17:08.232 --> 17:09.467
are you here
to buy some furniture?

17:09.502 --> 17:10.637
Yes, I am.

17:10.671 --> 17:12.173
-Okay, great.
-Good, good.

17:12.207 --> 17:13.810
Hey, listen, what if I told you

17:13.843 --> 17:16.181
you could get
your furniture for free?

17:16.215 --> 17:18.185
Yeah, see, times are
very inflatable right now, okay?

17:18.219 --> 17:20.122
Yeah, stop, stop.

17:20.156 --> 17:22.795
Have you ever considered
owning an inflatable couch?

17:22.828 --> 17:25.601
Oh, yeah, I don't have
a pool, so...

17:25.634 --> 17:27.538
-A pool?
-Yeah, for the...

17:27.571 --> 17:30.076
-Oh, no, no, no, I see,
I see the confusion.
-Oh-oh.

17:30.109 --> 17:31.713
-No, we're talking about
for inside.
-Yeah, inside your house.

17:31.746 --> 17:33.717
Oh. What?

17:33.750 --> 17:36.188
-Like, how much do you
currently rent your couch for?
-Yeah.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.791
I-I don't rent my couch.

17:37.825 --> 17:40.096
MAC (coughing):
What?

17:40.129 --> 17:43.803
(wheezing):
You pay full price
for your couch?

17:43.837 --> 17:45.741
That's outrageous.

17:45.774 --> 17:49.180
-CHARLIE: Oh, shit.
-DENNIS: Oh, no.

17:49.214 --> 17:50.717
(horn honks)

17:50.751 --> 17:52.855
-Goddamn it.
-Yeah.

17:52.888 --> 17:55.794
I'm telling you, man, you
have got to go to the hospital.

17:55.827 --> 17:59.301
Oh, and spend the remainder
of our nut on medical bills?

17:59.334 --> 18:00.570
I don't think so, Dennis.

18:00.604 --> 18:03.142
I'll simply stop
blowing up the furniture.

18:03.175 --> 18:06.616
It is not the furniture, Mac.
Okay? It is the nuts.

18:06.649 --> 18:08.218
Dee, what the hell
are you doing here?

18:08.252 --> 18:10.389
Guys, I have information

18:10.423 --> 18:12.093
that will change
the course of your company,

18:12.126 --> 18:15.667
and I will tell you what it is
if you let me stay here.

18:15.701 --> 18:17.136
Yeah, no, Charlie
already tried that shit.

18:17.170 --> 18:18.339
-I did that move, yeah.
-Yeah.

18:18.372 --> 18:20.176
(wheezing):
He, he did this.

18:20.209 --> 18:22.815
Yeah. Uh, Dee, why are you
gluing your hand to the wall?

18:22.848 --> 18:24.719
-I mean, it's no way
to solve a problem.
-CHARLIE: Yeah.

18:24.752 --> 18:26.288
Yeah, guys, please,

18:26.321 --> 18:27.524
I have a solution to
all of our problems,

18:27.558 --> 18:29.227
but you got to
let me talk, okay?

18:29.260 --> 18:30.697
Now, you guys are all
completely over-leveraged,

18:30.731 --> 18:32.367
and that's the problem,
right? My investment,

18:32.400 --> 18:33.903
this thing was only, like,
ten dollars a unit,

18:33.937 --> 18:35.674
then it, like, dropped down
to basically nothing,

18:35.707 --> 18:37.443
because it's a
speculative market, right?

18:37.477 --> 18:39.214
I'm making a bet that
the SEC's not gonna regulate.

18:39.247 --> 18:40.884
Of course, regulation's
gonna come in at some point,

18:40.917 --> 18:43.255
it always does, but right now
it's completely unregulated.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.661
Now, I'm not talking about
getting out over our skis,

18:45.694 --> 18:47.531
I'm just talking about making
an investment tonight,

18:47.564 --> 18:49.835
turn it around tomorrow--
we'll net double.

18:49.869 --> 18:51.305
Holy shit.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.309
-MAC: That's money talk.
-DENNIS: Yeah.

18:53.342 --> 18:54.879
-That's money talk.
-Where did you learn
to talk like that?

18:54.912 --> 18:56.616
Living with Frank, man.
I've been trying to tell you

18:56.649 --> 18:58.185
that I'm picking up
on this stuff. So, look, guys,

18:58.218 --> 19:00.489
let's pool all of
our remaining nut together

19:00.524 --> 19:02.460
and turn it into
a big pile of green,

19:02.494 --> 19:03.863
and then everybody gets a taste.

19:04.765 --> 19:07.571
Okay,
I didn't love
the sound of that, but, uh...

19:07.604 --> 19:09.274
Was it unclear?
I was talking about, like,

19:09.307 --> 19:11.646
a huge pile of green, like,
and everyone is, like...

19:11.679 --> 19:13.717
-Money talk?
-...slurping that shit down.

19:13.750 --> 19:15.152
Let's do it.

19:17.858 --> 19:20.162
-Bam.
-DEE: Oh, wow.

19:20.196 --> 19:22.568
-I've got a lot of questions.
-Yeah, me, too.

19:22.601 --> 19:24.204
Sure, sure. Go ahead.

19:24.237 --> 19:26.943
Now, Charlie, did
you take... all of my money...

19:26.976 --> 19:29.247
-Mm-hmm.
...and invest it in a box

19:29.280 --> 19:31.552
full of Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtle Pies?

19:31.586 --> 19:33.590
Yes. Very good, Dennis.
Very good.

19:33.623 --> 19:34.825
I wasn't sure you knew
what they are.

19:34.859 --> 19:36.194
Yeah, so these are,
like, from 1991.

19:36.228 --> 19:38.500
These are
the original ones, right?

19:38.533 --> 19:40.670
Super hard to find,
super valuable.

19:40.704 --> 19:43.442
-Are they?
-Oh, dude, big time. Right?
So, here's what I'm thinking.

19:43.475 --> 19:44.779
Could we turn
these around tonight

19:44.812 --> 19:47.383
and make a little profit?
Sure, but I say

19:47.417 --> 19:48.887
we sit on them.
Maybe we eat one or two.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.590
This is exactly what
I was worried about.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.326
Well, you're not thinking
big picture here.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.765
-No, I'm thinking big pic...
-All right, loan's due.

19:54.799 --> 19:56.669
First installment.

19:56.703 --> 19:58.205
And I'm armed

19:58.238 --> 20:00.911
and I got a vest,
so don't try nothing.

20:00.944 --> 20:03.248
What do you got there?

20:03.282 --> 20:04.518
1991's delicious cream-filled

20:04.552 --> 20:05.754
Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtle Pies,

20:05.787 --> 20:07.591
fresh from the sewers to me.

20:09.260 --> 20:10.630
Are they made from real turtle?

20:10.664 --> 20:12.300
Probably.

20:12.333 --> 20:13.703
How much you want for 'em?

20:13.737 --> 20:16.408
They're not for sale, Frank.

20:16.441 --> 20:18.947
Uh, mine... mine are for sale.

20:18.980 --> 20:21.552
I own some of those, and mine
are definitely for sale.

20:21.586 --> 20:23.255
He has a very
minimal share, Frank.

20:23.288 --> 20:25.226
Ah. (chuckles)

20:25.259 --> 20:27.998
Market dictates
the value, Charlie.

20:28.031 --> 20:30.302
Well...

20:30.336 --> 20:32.473
not when your demand
is more than

20:32.508 --> 20:34.979
the supply.

20:35.012 --> 20:37.684
Fine, I'll get 'em
somewhere else.

20:37.718 --> 20:39.655
Will you?

20:40.957 --> 20:42.928
Oh, I don't think so, Frank.

20:42.961 --> 20:44.532
DENNIS:
Oh... uh-oh.

20:44.565 --> 20:47.604
'Cause I bought the last
remaining ones there are.

20:47.638 --> 20:48.706
DENNIS:
No...

20:50.510 --> 20:52.548
Nice work.

20:52.581 --> 20:54.518
And you kept it crypto.

20:54.552 --> 20:56.756
You should have
listened to me, Frank.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.927
Fine.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.564
Name your price.

21:00.597 --> 21:04.003
Board up that new room
and the noisy toilet,

21:04.037 --> 21:06.609
forgive Mac and Dennis's loan,

21:06.642 --> 21:08.045
give Dee her apartment back,

21:08.078 --> 21:09.748
and return everything
to the status quo.

21:09.782 --> 21:11.017
That's too big a ask.

21:11.051 --> 21:12.654
That's inflation, Frank.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.357
You want the pies or not?

21:15.359 --> 21:17.396
Fine. Done.

21:18.733 --> 21:20.402
Good work, Charlie.

21:20.436 --> 21:21.739
Thank you very much, Frank.

21:21.772 --> 21:23.910
(gagging)

21:25.914 --> 21:28.820
I appreciate it. (gags)

21:28.853 --> 21:31.659
(coughing, gagging)

21:32.761 --> 21:34.899
(Mac wheezing)

21:39.575 --> 21:40.710
Are you still eating the nuts?

21:40.744 --> 21:41.913
Hmm?

21:49.127 --> 21:52.099
Does he want to get to
the hospital or to Costco?

21:52.133 --> 21:53.636
-DENNIS: Costco.
-DEE: He wants more nuts.

21:53.670 --> 21:55.072
CHARLIE:
Costco, yeah.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.809
You know what, buddy?
I think we'll take you

21:56.843 --> 21:58.513
to the hospital, and they'll
have nuts, and you can...

21:58.546 --> 21:59.882
you can die there.
