WEBVTT

00:07.512 --> 00:11.850
I left work early, but I had to get gas,
so I almost didn't make it on time.

00:13.518 --> 00:15.978
As far as conferences go,
this is boring.

00:17.188 --> 00:21.817
-How was Kyle's game?
-Amazing. Six-zero.

00:21.902 --> 00:26.114
Kyle pitched seven innings. Coach said
it was the fastest he's ever thrown.

00:26.196 --> 00:29.491
No way. Are you kidding me?
I'm sorry I missed it.

00:30.701 --> 00:32.786
I know you don't wanna celebrate,

00:32.871 --> 00:36.123
but I made a reservation at Brios
at seven tomorrow night.

00:36.207 --> 00:38.001
-You did?
-I did.

00:38.084 --> 00:39.251
That's awesome.

00:40.002 --> 00:44.089
I'll standby on the earlier flight.
Hopefully I'll be home by lunch.

00:44.173 --> 00:47.968
I hope so. Okay, babe.
I'll see you when you get here.

00:48.720 --> 00:51.264
-I love you.
-I love you, too. Sleep tight.

02:02.836 --> 02:04.420
May I help you?

02:04.503 --> 02:09.049
Good morning, ma'am. Kenneth
Goulet. Do you have a moment?

02:09.133 --> 02:13.096
BARRY
Season 3, Episode 4

02:18.892 --> 02:22.605
And all I'm sayin' is that
sometimes the police fall short.

02:22.938 --> 02:25.984
But justice, that's still attainable.

02:26.860 --> 02:28.486
Who is this?

02:28.569 --> 02:31.822
-You must be Kyle. I'm Kenneth Goulet.
-Please leave.

02:35.785 --> 02:37.077
Okay.

02:39.288 --> 02:44.753
You could've played at Michigan.
You decided to stay home. Why?

02:45.337 --> 02:48.298
Whatever it is you're sellin',
we don't want any.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.176
I know who killed your dad.

03:31.131 --> 03:32.384
Dad?

03:33.301 --> 03:36.263
-Have you been up all night?
-I fucked up, son.

03:36.345 --> 03:38.390
What is all this? What' going on?

03:38.472 --> 03:41.309
-I pissed off the wrong guy.
-Dad, you do that every day.

03:41.392 --> 03:43.769
We gotta leave.
We're leaving Dodge.

03:44.145 --> 03:47.690
-Leave L.A.? I can't leave L.A.
-Okay.

03:47.774 --> 03:50.484
You get ready.
I'm gonna pack the car.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.282
I'll get new suitcases.
Pack Gordon.

03:56.366 --> 03:57.909
Dad, I'm not leaving L.A.

03:57.993 --> 04:00.369
What the hell happened on
Laws of Humanity yesterday?

04:00.452 --> 04:02.622
Tom, this is not a good time.

04:02.705 --> 04:05.792
Tell them I was doing what
I thought was best for my family.

04:05.874 --> 04:08.544
They loved you.
They wanna bring you back.

04:09.545 --> 04:12.715
The showrunner told me he had
no idea you were that good.

04:12.799 --> 04:16.427
He said you gave pathos
to that sad old man character.

04:16.511 --> 04:19.472
And now they'll extend that part,
give you additional scenes.

04:19.555 --> 04:23.392
On Laws of fucking Humanity.
That show is huge!

04:23.476 --> 04:27.898
-Gets, like a 1.6 on the demo.
-Tom, I'm leaving town.

04:28.231 --> 04:32.068
-What? Why?
-I pissed off a guy I shouldn't have.

04:33.027 --> 04:36.114
I must say,
that's right on brand for you, Gene.

04:36.989 --> 04:40.909
I've been your agent for 30 years,
and it has not been easy.

04:41.702 --> 04:46.291
People told me you're narcissistic,
selfobsessed, petty, unhinged.

04:46.666 --> 04:48.251
Their words, not mine.

04:48.334 --> 04:52.881
Volatile, toxic, abusive, malignant,
a scrub, a dope, a dummy, a loser,

04:52.963 --> 04:56.091
a cocksucker, a dump truck,
a stone-cold buster.

04:56.176 --> 04:58.595
A bomb?
Why can't I just shoot the guy?

04:58.678 --> 05:01.223
-We wanted you to shoot them, but...
-Them?

05:01.305 --> 05:04.476
-I thought it was just Fernando.
-It was.

05:04.558 --> 05:09.564
But Dorn and DeLuise pointed out
that if we only kill Fernando,

05:09.647 --> 05:15.487
then an army of stunning Bolivian
soldiers would come kill all of us.

05:15.569 --> 05:20.282
So, it's been decided that you'll blow
them up during their midday meeting,

05:20.367 --> 05:22.368
which is usually around five p.m.

05:22.452 --> 05:26.039
Cristobal will be at Pilates
at that time, so he won't be there.

05:26.121 --> 05:27.706
So I'm bombing a house?

05:28.041 --> 05:30.460
And how! Peep this.
Give me your phone.

05:31.335 --> 05:33.295
You need the Detonate app.

05:33.837 --> 05:36.090
Shoot. I need your face.
Bingo.

05:38.133 --> 05:42.221
Would you like to receive Detonate
promotional offers? Absolutely.

05:42.304 --> 05:46.226
Can I have access to your photos?
Yes. Location services, always.

05:46.600 --> 05:50.521
Can I share personal information
with market research? Why not?

05:50.605 --> 05:54.358
And you are set.
Berkman goes boom.

05:54.442 --> 05:58.947
Password is "suddenlyseymour1985",
but the s's are all dollar signs.

05:59.029 --> 06:01.907
Thanks.
So, where's this bomb?

06:05.579 --> 06:07.204
It's right over there.

06:36.775 --> 06:38.152
Pick it up!

07:09.184 --> 07:11.644
I want my speech tonight
not to be corny.

07:11.728 --> 07:15.398
I want it to be honest and real.
Like the show.

07:15.481 --> 07:19.694
And not some superficial bullshit
about how it might be perceived.

07:20.862 --> 07:22.404
-Take this down.
-Yeah.

07:23.031 --> 07:28.245
I didn't write, direct, produce
and star in Joplin for the glory.

07:28.327 --> 07:33.041
I do this show for a little girl
who came from Joplin, Missouri.

07:33.124 --> 07:36.711
Maybe her name is Abigail,
but everybody calls her Thweetie.

07:36.794 --> 07:42.091
Her grandma had a lisp and she'd say,
"Thweetie, time to milk the cow!"

07:42.175 --> 07:46.012
Maybe Abigail lived on a farm,
so she was sheltered

07:46.096 --> 07:50.224
and she didn't see a TV set
until 14. At night, she'd be like,

07:50.308 --> 07:54.603
"Mama, promise me those little
people won't come out of the TV..."

07:54.688 --> 07:57.982
-Natalie. The little girl is me.
-You're Thweetie?

08:00.442 --> 08:04.447
Cracker ass, fruity bootie,
whack as hell, weak sauce,

08:04.781 --> 08:11.621
fuck head, fuck face, fuck nuts,
shit nuts, shit fuck, fuck fuck...

08:11.705 --> 08:14.749
-Somebody called me a fuck fuck?
-Rob Reiner, 1994

08:14.833 --> 08:18.461
At the Ghosts of Mississippi audition.
I said I don't want feedback.

08:18.545 --> 08:22.966
But now you can be known
as Gene Cousineau, great actor.

08:23.340 --> 08:26.428
I'll send you my new address.
I'm gonna be under another name.

08:26.510 --> 08:28.470
Go in and pay for these, will ya?

08:28.554 --> 08:30.097
Gene?

08:30.807 --> 08:32.266
Joe Mantegna?

08:32.350 --> 08:36.103
-Gene, it's Joe Mantegna.
-Shut the fuck up.

08:36.521 --> 08:41.775
Joe, I've had a stressful day.
Please, let's not make a scene here.

08:41.860 --> 08:46.280
I'm the one violating my restraining
order against you, hotshot.

08:46.864 --> 08:51.661
The only reason I came was to say
good job, what you did for that vet.

08:51.744 --> 08:53.037
What?

08:53.413 --> 08:56.207
-The Variety piece.
-You were in Variety?

09:02.172 --> 09:07.343
"Gene Cousineau, former actor,
pays it forward to America's heroes."

09:07.427 --> 09:10.805
You didn't make this at Knott's Berry
Farm to fuck with me, did ya?

09:10.889 --> 09:15.184
I do a lot of work with the vets,
too. Here's my challenge coin.

09:16.770 --> 09:20.023
"The casting director
from Laws of Humanity told Variety,"

09:20.105 --> 09:23.193
"few acting teachers accomplished
the extraordinary feat"

09:23.276 --> 09:26.487
"of saving a soldier's life
through acting."

09:26.571 --> 09:28.907
"Barry Berkman was once
a wooden soldier."

09:28.989 --> 09:32.493
"Thanks to Gene Cousineau,
he's become a real boy."

09:32.577 --> 09:33.870
What?

09:33.953 --> 09:36.456
I'm having dinner with some friends.

09:36.538 --> 09:42.670
Join us. This Friday, my house,
and we'll bury that hatchet.

09:42.754 --> 09:46.048
And I'll tell my lawyer
to remove that restraining order.

09:48.176 --> 09:49.802
Semper Fi, brother.

09:51.596 --> 09:56.393
Joe Mantegna invited you to his house.
Not to brawl, but to break bread.

09:56.475 --> 09:58.978
-I have to go.
-Do you know what this means?

09:59.061 --> 10:02.439
This is the industry-wide amnesia
we've been long hoping for.

10:02.524 --> 10:06.570
-Tom, I have to go.
-Why do you have to leave L.A.?

10:07.528 --> 10:10.698
If I tell you this,
it could get you killed.

10:11.740 --> 10:14.702
Not this again. I've explained this.
It's racist.

10:14.786 --> 10:17.079
Just because Tony Danza
is an Italian...

10:17.163 --> 10:20.165
This is worse than Tony Danza.
My life is in danger.

10:20.792 --> 10:24.462
The best thing for you
is to stay the hell away from me.

10:31.094 --> 10:34.805
I wanna be a law and order guy
as much as the next one. I do.

10:36.308 --> 10:39.727
But when somethin' stinks,
it stinks, am I wrong?

10:40.228 --> 10:42.314
It's always been very confusing.

10:42.397 --> 10:46.610
The police said Ryan was
murdered by Chechen gangsters.

10:48.068 --> 10:51.488
-Did that make sense to you then?
-No.

10:52.324 --> 10:58.204
My investigation says one
of his classmates, Barry Berkman,

10:58.705 --> 11:00.497
he pinned it on 'em.

11:00.581 --> 11:05.253
Maybe he was their associate,
he betrayed them, I don't know.

11:05.337 --> 11:09.715
I do know...
he sullied your son's good name.

11:11.008 --> 11:14.221
Your son wanted to be an actor,
right?

11:16.138 --> 11:19.935
This fella is in L.A. right now,
working as an actor.

11:21.602 --> 11:27.150
He took your son's life, and now
he's living your son's dream.

11:35.115 --> 11:36.992
That's his address.

11:48.380 --> 11:50.005
That's where he lives.

12:17.241 --> 12:21.412
I didn't write, direct, produce,
and star in Joplin for the glory.

12:22.079 --> 12:26.000
I do this show for a little girl
who came from Joplin, Missouri.

12:27.085 --> 12:30.338
-Who's the little girl?
-Me. Jesus! She's me.

12:30.421 --> 12:33.091
-Go inside.
-You'll just meet us there, then?

12:33.174 --> 12:36.469
-We're about to roll, so I gotta...
-Okay.

12:36.552 --> 12:39.431
-You'll make the screening though?
-Yeah.

12:39.513 --> 12:40.806
Okay.

12:40.891 --> 12:43.309
Love you, boo bear.
Wish me luck.

12:43.393 --> 12:46.020
The limo's here.
Where's Barry?

12:46.104 --> 12:48.647
His shoot's running late.
How do I look?

12:48.732 --> 12:51.067
-Beautiful.
-I don't look stressed out?

12:51.150 --> 12:54.446
Can you imagine back in Cousineau's
class when we did mirror exercises,

12:54.528 --> 12:57.906
that we'll be in a limo on our way
to your show's premiere?

12:57.991 --> 13:00.285
I'll see you there, okay?
Thank you!

13:34.194 --> 13:35.569
What?

13:51.835 --> 13:53.755
DETONATE

14:01.387 --> 14:03.180
PRESS FOR DETONATION

14:14.484 --> 14:15.944
Shit!

14:56.483 --> 14:58.235
This way! This way!

14:58.695 --> 15:01.156
-Explosive!
-Thank you.

15:01.239 --> 15:03.949
Rumor has it you're not from Joplin.
True, false?

15:04.034 --> 15:07.495
I'm from Joplin,
it says it on the poster.

15:07.578 --> 15:11.498
-We have Indie Wire.
-Sally, you look amazing.

15:11.583 --> 15:13.876
-Thank you.
-How are you feeling tonight?

15:13.959 --> 15:18.089
They say not to eat before these.
I'm hungry. But there'll be food later.

15:18.172 --> 15:20.341
I feel excited.

15:20.425 --> 15:21.926
You look good.
Who are you wearing?

15:22.010 --> 15:24.553
-I think it's... Who am I wearing?
-Shoshana.

15:24.637 --> 15:26.306
Shoshana. It's Shoshana.

15:26.388 --> 15:30.185
Please twirl.
Twirl for the girls! Yes!

15:30.267 --> 15:31.936
You're so pretty.

15:33.896 --> 15:36.398
You do not look old enough
to have an abused daughter.

15:36.483 --> 15:37.691
Thank you.

15:37.776 --> 15:39.736
What is your secret?

15:39.819 --> 15:43.240
I wash my face
and I try to get nine hours.

15:55.502 --> 15:57.127
Let's get you inside.

16:02.801 --> 16:05.177
Hello, this is Faye,
how can I help you today?

16:05.262 --> 16:08.932
My app isn't syncing with the Bluetooth
on the device I'm trying to detonate.

16:09.015 --> 16:12.143
Okay. I can help you with that.
What's your username?

16:12.601 --> 16:17.357
BerkmanGoesBoom, capital B,
capital G, capital B.

16:17.731 --> 16:20.777
Okay. Give me one second
while I pull up your account.

16:21.695 --> 16:26.741
I found you. Do you have the latest
version of Detonate installed?

16:26.824 --> 16:30.202
-I do.
-Okay. Is the Bluetooth on?

16:31.329 --> 16:32.955
Yes.

16:33.039 --> 16:36.083
Okay. I'm gonna put you
on a quick hold.

16:45.302 --> 16:46.595
There he is.

16:47.095 --> 16:49.556
-How was Pilates?
-Good.

16:50.348 --> 16:52.350
Are we still leaving tomorrow?

16:52.726 --> 16:56.646
Some things have come up
that I need to discuss with you.

16:57.313 --> 16:58.732
Okay.

16:58.815 --> 17:03.319
I have to admit, I didn't come to L.A.
only to run the Chechen operation.

17:03.694 --> 17:08.742
I came because felt you've been
disloyal to my daughter.

17:10.535 --> 17:12.662
Elena means the world to me.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.961
I had you followed
to your little love nest.

17:21.004 --> 17:24.007
What are you saying?
I don't know what you're saying.

17:27.551 --> 17:32.307
It's done. Glad you're out of there.
Are your men suspicious?

17:33.225 --> 17:37.646
No, I think they are having fun.
Need to see you.

17:38.103 --> 17:40.898
Meet at the place, one hour.
Make it two,

17:40.981 --> 17:48.114
the guys want to go to Buffalo
Wild Wings and try all the sauces.

17:48.907 --> 17:53.118
Ever wanted to kaboom? Join us
in our virtual kaboom room.

17:53.870 --> 17:57.373
Hi, thanks for waiting. I'm back.
I think I know what the problem is.

17:58.332 --> 18:01.378
You always wanted to be head
of the family one day.

18:01.961 --> 18:05.089
Elena thought you had potential.
I wasn't so sure.

18:05.923 --> 18:09.009
So, I gave you the easy work,
like running L.A.,

18:09.093 --> 18:15.183
which is the same as running
Disneyland. And yet you fuck it up.

18:15.725 --> 18:20.855
Why? Because you have
no mental toughness.

18:21.398 --> 18:23.817
So, let's do a test.

18:25.526 --> 18:28.821
I'm gonna give you two choices.
We'll see how you do.

18:29.239 --> 18:31.908
-Is your Wi-Fi on?
-Is my Wi-Fi on?

18:32.367 --> 18:33.743
Yes, it is.

18:33.826 --> 18:37.955
-Turn it off and see if that helps.
-Turn the Wi-Fi off?

18:38.038 --> 18:39.457
One,

18:40.833 --> 18:44.379
I kill you and make my daughter
a widow,

18:44.461 --> 18:49.551
or two, you take me to your lover,
NoHo Hank,

18:50.051 --> 18:52.762
and you shoot him in the head.

18:56.850 --> 18:58.350
Suegro...

19:02.564 --> 19:05.065
You're going to have to kill me.

19:12.615 --> 19:16.161
Well...
Must be true love.

19:19.331 --> 19:20.748
Kill him!

19:21.540 --> 19:23.001
Turning Wi-Fi off.

19:29.216 --> 19:32.426
Sounds like we were successful.
Is there anything else?

19:33.845 --> 19:35.095
Shit!

19:59.746 --> 20:02.290
Reviews are out!
The enfuego's been lifted!

20:02.374 --> 20:04.459
The embargo's been lifted.
Let me see that.

20:04.541 --> 20:08.338
-Critics don't matter.
-Sally, this is from New York Times.

20:08.420 --> 20:11.840
"A show by women, about women,
for women,"

20:11.925 --> 20:15.261
"Joplin avoids the pitfalls
of the female-driven dramedy"

20:15.345 --> 20:18.265
"by delivering a full depiction
of self-love."

20:18.347 --> 20:20.559
If critics could do what I do,
they'd be doing it.

20:20.641 --> 20:25.354
Your show has a 98 on Rotten
Tomatoes! And "Pam" only has 27!

20:26.273 --> 20:30.151
I'm constantly in awe
of her work ethic, her empathy,

20:30.235 --> 20:33.280
and her brutal honesty,
especially with herself.

20:33.363 --> 20:38.618
I'm new to the business, but I'm lucky
to have not only such a great part,

20:38.701 --> 20:40.704
but a really great partner.

20:40.786 --> 20:43.999
Here she is, the creator
and star of Joplin, Sally Reed.

20:50.005 --> 20:51.798
Thank you, Katie.

20:51.882 --> 20:56.093
Working with you was one of the most
rewarding experiences of my career.

20:56.761 --> 20:59.013
You make me want to be
a better actor.

21:03.976 --> 21:06.146
Okay. Good evening.

21:09.024 --> 21:14.779
I didn't write, direct, produce,
and star in Joplin for the glory.

21:15.572 --> 21:22.745
I do this show for a little girl,
who came from Joplin, Missouri.

21:23.622 --> 21:28.668
And, she so badly needed
to hear this story,

21:29.293 --> 21:32.464
to know that she wasn't alone.

21:34.423 --> 21:35.926
And...

21:36.635 --> 21:43.057
If there is another little girl out
there who also needs to hear it,

21:43.433 --> 21:45.560
then I have done my job as a...

21:48.520 --> 21:50.023
l'm sorry.

21:50.898 --> 21:55.237
Someone just told me that we got
a 98 on Rotten Tomatoes,

21:55.319 --> 21:57.446
and it really only just hit me now.

22:06.206 --> 22:09.667
If you believe your best review,
you've gotta believe your worst.

22:09.751 --> 22:12.629
So, after I got called unforgivable
in the Pasadena Star,

22:12.712 --> 22:15.799
I vowed never to read
another review. But... 98!

22:19.260 --> 22:20.552
Wow!

22:22.930 --> 22:24.849
90 fucking eight!

23:13.314 --> 23:15.065
And I just...

23:15.399 --> 23:17.192
I just wanna thank...

23:17.777 --> 23:22.574
all the incredible people in my life,
who got me here.

23:24.491 --> 23:30.748
My teacher, and mentor,
Mister Gene M. Cousineau.

23:30.832 --> 23:33.626
He taught me to be fearless.

23:33.710 --> 23:37.212
And my incredible agent Lindsay.

23:37.296 --> 23:42.509
You've been a fierce advocate
of my work.

23:42.844 --> 23:45.931
And my boyfriend, Barry.

23:46.014 --> 23:50.017
Thank you for being an amazing
boyfriend. You support me.

23:50.101 --> 23:53.103
I couldn't do this without you
and I love you so much.

23:55.148 --> 23:59.736
Who else? God. I almost forgot
to thank God. Thank you so much.

23:59.819 --> 24:04.282
They're playing me off. I didn't
think they did that at premieres.

24:10.538 --> 24:13.583
He was in Fernando's house
when the bomb went off.

24:13.667 --> 24:16.377
-But he's all right.
-Oh, my God!

24:17.336 --> 24:19.505
Oh, my God.

24:22.676 --> 24:24.635
I got you. Come on.

24:27.430 --> 24:33.060
Barry, thank you. Thank you
so much. Come here. I got you.

24:34.853 --> 24:36.356
I got you.

25:06.093 --> 25:10.682
-You killed that.
-You killed that. We killed it.

25:10.765 --> 25:13.768
Oh, my God, I need a drink.
Where is the bar in this place?

25:13.852 --> 25:16.897
That was amazing.
This woman was crying so hard.

25:17.272 --> 25:19.690
Her boyfriend was like, "Calm down".

25:19.774 --> 25:22.776
I knew people would like it,
but come on. We did something...

25:22.860 --> 25:25.238
Sally, you're dating a violent guy.

25:25.572 --> 25:26.865
What?

25:28.950 --> 25:30.994
I'm sorry.

25:32.161 --> 25:35.039
But Barry is a violent guy.

25:35.122 --> 25:40.794
And the way he spoke to you
the other day was, like, awful.

25:40.879 --> 25:43.298
-It was really scary.
-He was in a mood.

25:43.923 --> 25:45.299
I just...

25:46.176 --> 25:49.470
That was just really bad.
That was really bad. And...

25:50.555 --> 25:52.349
I don't know. I just...

25:53.934 --> 25:56.895
You're a really amazing person.
And...

25:58.062 --> 26:01.066
I don't wanna see you get hurt.
So...

26:05.237 --> 26:06.820
Oh, my God, look!

26:08.405 --> 26:11.117
I don't mean to bother you.
You were wonderful.

26:11.201 --> 26:12.702
Such good work.

26:16.665 --> 26:18.040
Leo!

26:18.708 --> 26:21.086
I packed the car.
We gotta get going.

26:21.418 --> 26:26.131
Yeah, Dad, give us a second.
We gotta get Gordon's shoes on.

26:28.300 --> 26:31.637
Please. Don't hurt them.

26:35.475 --> 26:37.685
I'm sorry I took you hostage.

26:38.978 --> 26:40.689
And to make up for it...

26:43.607 --> 26:46.026
I took a job.
That money's Leo's.

26:46.903 --> 26:50.614
-Where did you get it?
-Never mind. It's yours. Take it.

26:51.616 --> 26:54.995
And after today,
you never have to see me again.

26:57.038 --> 26:59.082
So, my family is safe?

27:01.751 --> 27:04.379
-Thanks for everything, Mr. Cousineau.
-Dad.

27:12.470 --> 27:14.055
Where'd you get that?

27:18.935 --> 27:20.520
Leo,

27:22.271 --> 27:28.111
we're going to stay right here
in Los Angeles.

27:30.196 --> 27:33.241
-It was kind of crazy.
-It was crazy. I didn't...

27:34.199 --> 27:36.869
Barry is over there.

27:36.953 --> 27:40.040
-Okay. I'll call you later.
-You were great.

27:40.123 --> 27:41.498
-Thank you!
-Yeah.

27:45.837 --> 27:47.088
Hey.

27:48.131 --> 27:49.966
-I missed it.
-Yeah, you did.

27:50.049 --> 27:51.675
Fuck. I'm sorry.

27:52.052 --> 27:53.887
-You look great.
-Thanks.

27:53.969 --> 27:55.513
How did it go?

27:55.596 --> 28:01.560
Honestly,
it was the greatest night of my life.

28:03.395 --> 28:06.273
That's great.
Hey, I'm sorry.

28:06.358 --> 28:08.026
Barry, we're done.

28:09.652 --> 28:11.445
Because I missed the premiere?

28:11.528 --> 28:15.908
The way you yelled at me
the other day at the office

28:17.743 --> 28:20.705
it sent me to a place
I never wanna go again.

28:20.789 --> 28:24.125
-This relationship isn't good for me.
-Are you serious?

28:24.876 --> 28:27.127
I had a bad day.
I can't have a bad day?

28:27.545 --> 28:33.384
I'm gonna stay at Natalie's.
Pack up your stuff and move out.

28:33.468 --> 28:34.885
No.

28:34.969 --> 28:38.055
Sally!
Sally!

28:53.696 --> 28:56.073
I can't believe we're doing this.

28:56.950 --> 28:58.493
I know.

28:59.201 --> 29:03.414
But it's like the guy said.
The cops aren't doing anything, mom.

29:05.958 --> 29:08.043
I don't see any other way.

29:08.461 --> 29:11.339
I just never thought I was
this kind of person.

29:13.341 --> 29:15.719
But this will bring us peace.

29:17.012 --> 29:18.679
You promise?

29:19.180 --> 29:21.140
I promise, Mom.

29:24.184 --> 29:29.148
And...
I can do this alone, okay?

29:37.740 --> 29:39.825
It's gotta be both of us.

29:44.580 --> 29:46.750
I think we'll take the Glock.

29:49.251 --> 29:50.670
Sweet.

29:52.797 --> 29:55.799
END OF EPISODE 4
Season 3
