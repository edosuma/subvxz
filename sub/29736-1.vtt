WEBVTT

03:51.475 --> 03:53.642
Oh, really? Okay, okay.

03:53.683 --> 03:55.183
Yeah, why not?

03:55.225 --> 03:56.475
Hey, isn't that Mia?

03:58.058 --> 04:00.475
I'm so sorry,
I-I must have slipped.

04:00.517 --> 04:03.808
Did you have a nice swim there?

04:03.808 --> 04:04.725
Don't touch me.

04:04.725 --> 04:06.767
Oh, my God!

04:09.850 --> 04:11.642
It was an accident, I swear.

04:14.433 --> 04:16.517
Dude, your sister is so lame.

04:17.975 --> 04:19.642
She's not my sister.

04:19.683 --> 04:20.267
Come on.

04:20.308 --> 04:21.308
Let's go.

04:26.767 --> 04:27.767
Oh, my God!

04:28.642 --> 04:30.100
Such a loser!

04:46.433 --> 04:50.058
Why is she all wet? I swear!

04:51.600 --> 04:52.642
I'm sorry about that.

04:52.683 --> 04:53.850
But we are going to see
you tomorrow, right?

04:53.892 --> 04:54.725
Yeah. Tomorrow.

04:54.767 --> 04:56.017
Okay. Bye.

04:56.850 --> 04:59.183
It's going to be
amazing! I promise!

04:59.267 --> 05:02.058
Amazing! Bring your bikini!

05:14.183 --> 05:15.850
Do you want to tell
me what happened?

05:18.392 --> 05:20.225
You should just drive.

05:44.975 --> 05:46.100
Hey, Mrs. Riley.

05:46.142 --> 05:47.142
Hey!

05:48.892 --> 05:51.058
Whoa, did you go for a
swim in your clothes?

05:51.100 --> 05:52.100
Shut up, Ben!

05:52.142 --> 05:52.892
Hey, Mimi!

05:52.933 --> 05:53.850
Don't call me that!

05:53.892 --> 05:55.058
Why are you all wet?

05:58.267 --> 05:59.392
Why is she all wet?

05:59.433 --> 06:00.975
I have to talk to her, babe.

06:02.600 --> 06:06.975
What happened? Hey!
What happened?

06:07.142 --> 06:09.308
Somebody pushed her in
the pool at school.

06:09.392 --> 06:10.475
No big deal.

06:11.433 --> 06:13.767
It's not my fault that
nobody likes her.

06:15.225 --> 06:17.850
You know, that's a real
nasty thing to say.

06:19.100 --> 06:20.392
Sorry.

06:20.517 --> 06:21.517
Sasha!

06:22.142 --> 06:24.850
Look, I know it's
tough moving here,

06:24.933 --> 06:27.142
but you two got to look
out for each other, okay?

06:28.767 --> 06:29.850
Okay.

06:30.058 --> 06:31.058
Thanks.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.100
You guys about done?

06:34.225 --> 06:35.725
Yeah, you are all
loaded up, boss.

06:35.850 --> 06:37.308
Alright. Thanks, Ben.

06:37.433 --> 06:38.392
See you tomorrow?

06:38.433 --> 06:40.017
See you tomorrow,
Carl. Get some rest.

06:40.058 --> 06:40.767
Yeah. I will do.

06:40.808 --> 06:42.017
Alright, thanks.

06:54.600 --> 06:58.100
Hey.
Mind if I come in?

07:06.267 --> 07:07.433
What's going on?

07:11.725 --> 07:12.933
I hate it here.

07:16.642 --> 07:19.142
Mia, you're so much stronger
than you think you are.

07:20.392 --> 07:23.350
And if your Mom were here,
she'd be really proud of you.

07:24.183 --> 07:25.850
Well, she's not here, is she?

07:29.392 --> 07:31.308
Well, I'm proud to
call you my daughter.

07:34.725 --> 07:38.267
Look, I know you and Sasha have
a hard time sometimes, but we're family.

07:42.850 --> 07:44.350
She's not my sister.

07:54.767 --> 07:55.642
It's very good.

07:55.725 --> 07:56.725
It's great.

08:01.058 --> 08:03.725
Hey, I almost forgot to show you
guys what I found this morning.

08:04.642 --> 08:05.642
Look at this.

08:08.392 --> 08:09.392
That's a shark tooth.

08:09.392 --> 08:10.392
Yeah.

08:12.183 --> 08:13.017
Is it a great white?

08:13.058 --> 08:14.433
I think so.

08:14.475 --> 08:15.558
Where did you find it?

08:15.600 --> 08:18.683
We uncovered a passageway that
leads to a new part of the city.

08:19.475 --> 08:20.475
Nice.

08:21.142 --> 08:22.975
But how did the
shark get in there?

08:23.058 --> 08:24.058
I don't know.

08:24.267 --> 08:27.600
Maybe he swam in from the
sea, chasing a seal,

08:27.642 --> 08:30.517
Got lost in the tunnels
hundreds of years ago.

08:33.892 --> 08:35.475
That's so cool!

08:35.558 --> 08:36.850
You can keep it.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.058
That kind of brings me
around to something else.

08:39.142 --> 08:41.558
Girls, I know I said I
was going to hang with you this weekend,

08:41.642 --> 08:43.933
But opening
this new passageway,

08:43.975 --> 08:46.225
It means that there's
this team of archaeologists.

08:46.267 --> 08:48.058
- They fly in from Europe next week.
- It's fine, Dad.

08:48.100 --> 08:50.767
So I got to finish mapping the
caves, laying the lights...

08:50.808 --> 08:52.058
You don't have to explain.

08:52.100 --> 08:55.975
But your father planned
something very special for the two of you.

08:58.017 --> 08:59.308
What?

08:59.392 --> 09:01.475
Well, the shark tooth is a clue.

09:02.892 --> 09:04.933
Girls, come on. Here, show them.

09:06.433 --> 09:07.433
There you go.

09:10.767 --> 09:12.725
A glass bottomed boat ride

09:12.767 --> 09:16.475
To see great white
sharks in their natural habitat?

09:16.558 --> 09:17.767
Sounds fun to me.

09:17.892 --> 09:19.058
No. This is for tourists.

09:19.183 --> 09:20.725
Well, we're kind of tourists.

09:20.808 --> 09:22.058
Girls, it's going to be awesome.

09:22.100 --> 09:25.183
They take you out to where
the great whites feed.

09:25.267 --> 09:28.850
You get to watch them through this
viewing gallery in the bottom of the ship.

09:28.933 --> 09:29.517
It's awesome.

09:29.558 --> 09:31.517
No. I have plans for tomorrow.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.933
Well, you'll just have
to rearrange your plans.

09:34.017 --> 09:36.225
And besides, I think this is a
wonderful way for the two of you

09:36.267 --> 09:38.308
- To spend quality time together.
- Yeah.

09:42.892 --> 09:44.267
Where are you going?

09:44.475 --> 09:47.267
To let Alexa and Nicole know
that I can't hang out tomorrow.

09:47.350 --> 09:49.017
Is that okay?

09:49.183 --> 09:50.308
Watch your tone.

09:52.225 --> 09:56.683
Well, I am sorry about tomorrow,
but the sharks are going to be really cool.

09:57.100 --> 09:59.933
And maybe next week you and
I can go scuba diving.

09:59.975 --> 10:01.975
Remember how much you
used to like diving with me?

10:02.017 --> 10:03.975
Yeah, I was, like,
ten years old, Dad.

10:04.017 --> 10:06.892
Ten years old. The youngest
person I'd ever seen scuba dive.

10:06.933 --> 10:08.183
Come on. Are you kidding me?

10:08.267 --> 10:09.642
And the cutest.

10:10.017 --> 10:11.933
Yeah, you were
like a little sea monkey.

10:25.975 --> 10:29.558
Alright, guys. Who's
ready to see some sharks today?

10:32.350 --> 10:34.142
I'll pick you
up on the way home. Okay?

10:37.725 --> 10:38.892
Alright.

10:40.975 --> 10:44.058
Hey, Mimi, don't
get eaten by a shark!

10:44.142 --> 10:44.642
Stop!

10:44.683 --> 10:47.100
Yeah, Mimi, don't get
eaten by a shark!

10:50.058 --> 10:51.933
Hey, if you start to drown,
we'll come and save you.

10:51.975 --> 10:54.017
I'll save you!

11:02.350 --> 11:03.350
Look!

11:04.767 --> 11:06.850
I can't
believe she's here.

11:07.808 --> 11:09.017
Oh, my gosh!

11:15.267 --> 11:16.850
What the hell are you
guys doing here?

11:16.892 --> 11:18.183
Come on. We had plans.

11:18.308 --> 11:19.308
I told you, I can't.

11:19.350 --> 11:21.517
Dude, I am going to take
you to a place that

11:21.558 --> 11:24.392
no tourists would ever
find in a million years.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.433
Chance of a lifetime.

11:26.475 --> 11:28.683
Or would you rather stay on
this stupid boat instead?

11:28.725 --> 11:29.725
Yeah.

11:31.142 --> 11:33.100
I mean stay.
Stay if you want to.

11:33.933 --> 11:35.892
Hey, maybe you can become
friends with Catherine.

11:36.475 --> 11:38.433
Talk about how
beautiful she is!

11:38.475 --> 11:39.642
She is beautiful though.

11:39.683 --> 11:41.142
Dude, shut up!

11:41.225 --> 11:42.225
It's up to you.

11:43.808 --> 11:45.183
- Come on!
- One second.

11:48.517 --> 11:51.308
You really want to spend
all day on a boat with those girls?

11:53.683 --> 11:54.933
Come on.

11:55.058 --> 11:56.517
She's so scared.

11:58.683 --> 12:00.725
What do you think?

12:00.850 --> 12:01.642
I don't know.

12:01.683 --> 12:03.558
Don't let those
girls get to you.

12:04.808 --> 12:05.808
Catherine.

12:08.683 --> 12:09.683
Come on.

12:12.350 --> 12:13.892
Goodbye, Catherine.

12:14.642 --> 12:16.267
Let's go. Come on.

14:01.933 --> 14:03.225
Okay, watch your step.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.433
Guys, come on!
We're almost there.

14:27.517 --> 14:28.725
You keep saying that.

14:28.808 --> 14:30.100
This time I mean it.

14:40.267 --> 14:41.767
Oh, my God!

14:45.017 --> 14:46.017
Whoa!

14:46.350 --> 14:49.017
I mean, how did you
even find out about this place?

14:49.767 --> 14:51.225
Ben took me here.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.683
Ben? Like my
stepdad's assistant Ben?

14:54.725 --> 14:56.892
Oh, she... stop with
that. Oh, my God!

14:57.975 --> 15:00.183
Okay, so how do we get down there?

15:00.558 --> 15:02.850
So there's a path that'll
take us around and down.

15:06.725 --> 15:07.933
Or you could go that way.

15:10.558 --> 15:12.100
What are you waiting for?

15:12.267 --> 15:13.558
It's amazing!

15:14.267 --> 15:15.892
I don't know, I...

15:19.683 --> 15:20.975
We should take the path.

15:23.808 --> 15:25.558
That was amazing!

15:25.850 --> 15:27.100
Screw the path.

16:48.767 --> 16:50.017
That's so cool.

16:50.142 --> 16:51.558
Look at all this stuff.

16:55.225 --> 16:56.225
Whoa.

16:59.517 --> 17:00.683
That's a
lot of scuba gear.

17:00.725 --> 17:03.225
This is all the equipment that
your stepdad and Ben have been storing

17:03.267 --> 17:05.767
for the archaeologist team
that's coming next week.

17:05.808 --> 17:08.558
Is this the entrance
to the City?

17:08.683 --> 17:10.892
Guys, if my Dad finds
us, he's going to kill us.

17:10.933 --> 17:12.933
Chill. I talked to Ben.

17:13.017 --> 17:15.933
Your Dad is on the other
side, mapping out the new tunnel they found.

17:16.142 --> 17:17.892
They will never
know we were here.

17:18.017 --> 17:20.392
Doesn't look like
much of a city to me.

17:20.433 --> 17:21.433
It's Mayan.

17:22.349 --> 17:24.974
It was built underground,
out of their burial sites,

17:25.724 --> 17:28.142
to hide from the Conquistadors
when they invaded.

17:29.558 --> 17:32.183
Rising sea levels put
most of it underwater.

17:32.725 --> 17:34.100
Thank you, Professor.

17:34.517 --> 17:36.808
Did Ben ever take
you diving into the city?

17:36.933 --> 17:38.142
Yeah, once.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.142
What's it like?

17:40.683 --> 17:42.517
It's pretty insane down there.

17:42.850 --> 17:45.642
I mean, we only went as
far as the first cave.

17:45.933 --> 17:48.100
It was built as an entrance to

17:49.142 --> 17:52.392
- ...is it Xibalba? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Xibalba! Yeah!

17:53.017 --> 17:54.892
- Place of fear.
- Yeah.

17:55.017 --> 17:57.392
Like I was saying, the
Mayan underworld.

17:58.100 --> 17:59.475
Burial caves.

18:00.933 --> 18:03.433
Yeah, it's pretty scary,
but it's really cool.

18:03.517 --> 18:07.183
They have all these old
statues, and altars, and stuff.

18:09.183 --> 18:10.517
So what are we waiting for?

18:12.975 --> 18:14.642
Come on. Just the first cave.

18:14.683 --> 18:16.683
- But my Dad...
- Is miles away!

18:17.808 --> 18:19.392
Yeah, they have a
different way in.

18:19.433 --> 18:21.683
Here, look. Everything we need.

18:22.308 --> 18:24.600
I mean, there's no fins, so...

18:24.725 --> 18:27.808
Come on! It's the first cave.
We're not swimming the whole city.

18:27.933 --> 18:30.225
Guys, cave diving is dangerous.

18:30.350 --> 18:31.433
Cave
diving is dangerous!

18:31.475 --> 18:33.142
No. Mia
is right, Nicole.

18:33.225 --> 18:34.933
I don't really know about this.

18:35.017 --> 18:38.725
Look, we've come all this way
and we don't even see the temple? Really?

18:38.808 --> 18:41.725
- It's unlike anything you ever seen before.
- Yeah.

18:41.767 --> 18:44.225
We should just go in, go
once around the first cave, and then out.

18:44.308 --> 18:45.308
Yeah. Come on.

18:46.683 --> 18:48.850
When was the last
time you went diving?

18:49.642 --> 18:50.642
Years ago.

18:50.975 --> 18:52.933
- I used to go all the time with Dad,
- ALEXA: Perfect.

18:53.017 --> 18:54.975
but I've never been
in caves before.

18:56.683 --> 18:59.308
It's like riding a
bike, right? I mean...

18:59.392 --> 19:00.058
Come on, Mia!

19:00.100 --> 19:00.642
Mimi!

19:00.683 --> 19:03.642
Yeah, she's going to do
it! Let's go! Let's go, that's great!

19:03.683 --> 19:06.808
- Let's go, Mia! Yes!
- Come on! We're doing it, let's go!

19:10.767 --> 19:13.392
Hey, it's going to be fun, okay?

19:13.433 --> 19:15.517
Just remember, keep your
movements nice and small.

19:15.558 --> 19:17.558
Last thing you want to do
is kick up silt down there.

19:17.558 --> 19:19.100
You won't be able to
see your own hands.

19:19.433 --> 19:21.142
Okay. You guys ready?

19:21.225 --> 19:23.308
I'm going to lead. Keep
behind me at all times.

19:23.350 --> 19:25.517
One circuit around the
first cave, and back.

19:26.183 --> 19:27.392
Yes, teacher.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.475
Nicole, I'm serious.
Either you do as I say, or...

19:29.517 --> 19:31.100
Yeah, I hear you.

19:34.933 --> 19:36.267
we don't do it at all.

19:48.017 --> 19:50.558
Let's go,
ladies. Get a move on.

19:50.600 --> 19:53.683
Everyone okay? Sasha, are you good?

19:53.767 --> 19:55.058
Yeah.

19:55.225 --> 19:56.183
Mia?

19:56.558 --> 19:57.558
Yeah, I'm good.

19:57.808 --> 20:00.850
Everybody check your air gauges.
You should all have a full tank.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.142
Mine's on 100 percent.

20:06.642 --> 20:07.642
Me too.

20:08.017 --> 20:10.433
Come on, I'm
getting old already!

20:10.892 --> 20:12.517
Okay. Turn your lights on.

20:13.808 --> 20:16.767
Follow me. The entrance is just
at the bottom of the steps.

20:17.392 --> 20:18.392
Let's go.

21:00.642 --> 21:04.100
You guys are going to
freak out. It's insane down there.

21:15.850 --> 21:16.850
Come on!

21:17.225 --> 21:19.808
Oh, my God. Are
you sure about this?

21:20.392 --> 21:21.600
Yeah, trust me.

21:53.475 --> 21:55.517
Oh, my God!
This is so crazy!

22:02.392 --> 22:04.975
I can't believe we're
doing this.

22:12.433 --> 22:13.433
Look at that.

22:17.100 --> 22:20.600
Run out of air in a
cave, and your last chance is sucking the air from those.

22:20.642 --> 22:21.725
Seriously?

22:22.017 --> 22:23.975
For sure.
You want to try it?

22:24.850 --> 22:27.683
The corridor gets narrow
up here, so single file.

22:35.933 --> 22:37.183
Just through here.

22:38.642 --> 22:40.100
You all okay?

22:40.225 --> 22:41.142
- Yup.
- Yeah.

22:41.225 --> 22:42.475
Yeah, I'm good.

23:01.725 --> 23:04.017
Sasha, you could barely
get your ass through there.

23:05.850 --> 23:07.892
Shut up, Nicole. At
least I have an ass.

23:21.642 --> 23:23.350
All okay? Mia?

23:23.475 --> 23:24.642
- Yeah.
- Sasha?

23:24.683 --> 23:26.183
Nicole?

23:26.225 --> 23:27.683
Yes, teacher!

23:29.933 --> 23:31.392
You guys ready for this?

23:46.100 --> 23:47.975
Holy...

23:48.058 --> 23:49.225
...crap!

23:49.308 --> 23:50.642
That's so cool!

23:52.225 --> 23:53.475
I told you guys.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.183
Xibalba.

23:56.600 --> 23:58.683
This place is insane, right?

23:59.142 --> 24:01.142
Hey. Nicole! No!

24:01.183 --> 24:02.433
Keep behind me and
keep together.

24:02.475 --> 24:04.975
Okay. Okay. Okay.

24:06.267 --> 24:08.892
One lap around the altar, and
then we head back, right?

24:08.933 --> 24:09.933
Right.

24:12.558 --> 24:13.558
Let's go.

24:21.767 --> 24:23.600
Oh, my God!

25:21.225 --> 25:23.683
They made human
sacrifices here.

25:24.308 --> 25:25.517
Creepy.

25:37.392 --> 25:38.642
Guys, did you see that?

25:38.683 --> 25:40.392
I think I saw something move.

25:41.475 --> 25:43.475
There's nothing
down here, Nicole.

25:47.725 --> 25:48.975
There was
something there.

25:48.975 --> 25:50.892
Oh, come on, Nicole.

25:50.933 --> 25:52.308
Maybe it was a mermaid.

25:53.517 --> 25:55.433
Shut up,
Sasha. I'm serious.

25:56.183 --> 25:59.392
Come on, Nicole.
Stop messing around.

25:59.517 --> 26:01.100
Maybe it was my Dad.

26:01.558 --> 26:03.933
Your Dad's on the
other side of the city.

26:04.017 --> 26:06.142
There's nothing there.
Nicole's just being an idiot.

26:06.183 --> 26:07.892
I heard that, Alexa.

26:07.975 --> 26:09.683
Come on, let's just go back.

26:09.767 --> 26:12.350
We said we would come in, and
then head straight back out, right?

26:16.308 --> 26:17.308
Nicole!

26:25.433 --> 26:26.433
Nicole?

26:27.517 --> 26:29.600
Nicole, stop
being an idiot.

26:51.058 --> 26:52.267
Come, look, look!

26:54.892 --> 26:55.808
Look!

26:55.892 --> 26:57.308
Oh, my God!

26:59.225 --> 27:00.933
Where are its eyes?

27:01.058 --> 27:02.892
It doesn't have any.

27:03.058 --> 27:06.767
It's a Mexican tetra... a blind cave fish.

27:06.975 --> 27:08.808
Wait, I
heard about these.

27:09.017 --> 27:11.892
No light down here, so they
don't need color or eyes.

27:12.350 --> 27:13.808
They evolved without.

27:15.475 --> 27:17.475
How does it
know where it's going?

27:17.725 --> 27:19.600
Heightened senses.

27:19.767 --> 27:21.475
I didn't know they got this big.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.392
It's probably never
known a human.

27:24.558 --> 27:25.808
It's hiding from us.

27:26.433 --> 27:29.683
Well, who says it's
us it's hiding from?

27:29.808 --> 27:31.475
Stop!

27:31.558 --> 27:33.933
- Here, fishy fishy! Nice to meet...
- No, Nicole. I wouldn't.

27:35.183 --> 27:36.517
No!

27:40.308 --> 27:41.808
No, stop it from falling!

27:43.350 --> 27:44.600
No!

27:55.892 --> 27:58.433
Guys? Guys?

28:00.017 --> 28:01.683
I can't hear you!

28:01.767 --> 28:03.683
ALEXA'S VOICE
DISTORTED: Nobody move!

28:04.100 --> 28:07.517
Anyone? Nicole?
Sasha, where are you?

28:10.517 --> 28:14.642
Guys? I can't see
you guys, where are you?

28:23.392 --> 28:26.183
Sasha... I can't hear
you, guys, where are you?

28:27.267 --> 28:28.475
Sasha!

28:32.183 --> 28:33.558
I can't see anyone.

28:40.725 --> 28:42.267
Sasha!

28:53.642 --> 28:54.850
Sasha!

28:57.058 --> 28:58.933
Alexa, I can't see!

28:59.392 --> 29:01.433
Mia!

29:01.475 --> 29:03.183
Mia! What are
you doing here?

29:03.183 --> 29:05.642
Oh, my God! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

29:05.683 --> 29:07.558
- We were at the lake and...
- Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.

29:07.558 --> 29:10.267
- Calm down, alright? It's okay.
- It was really stupid, I'm sorry.

29:10.558 --> 29:14.058
Let me guess. Alexa persuaded
you to come down here, huh?

29:14.642 --> 29:16.558
And then we knocked
over a stone column,

29:16.600 --> 29:19.142
and I got totally
lost in the silt.

29:19.767 --> 29:21.975
You didn't think to come
down here with a guideline?

29:21.975 --> 29:23.433
Mia! Mia! Thank God!

29:23.558 --> 29:25.225
Oh, man, I
should've known.

29:25.267 --> 29:27.392
So you thought you'd try a
little bit of cave diving, huh?

29:27.433 --> 29:29.100
I'm... I'm so sorry.

29:29.142 --> 29:32.308
Honestly, we were supposed to
just go in and then straight back out again.

29:32.350 --> 29:35.017
That's the last time I'm
showing you any of my secret spots.

29:35.142 --> 29:37.725
I take it Sasha and
Nicole are close by?

29:38.350 --> 29:39.517
They're
waiting by the exit.

29:39.558 --> 29:41.100
Yeah? What a surprise.

29:41.725 --> 29:44.558
Let's just get you guys
the hell out of here before your Dad finds out.

29:44.642 --> 29:45.933
You're not going
to tell him, are you?

29:45.975 --> 29:47.225
Are you kidding me?

29:57.517 --> 29:59.433
Alexa, where
are the others?

29:59.767 --> 30:04.808
MIA, FRANTICALLY: Where are
they? Sasha? Nicole? Sasha?

30:04.892 --> 30:07.350
Mia!
Where are you?

30:07.517 --> 30:10.100
Sasha! Look they're
here, they're here!

30:10.142 --> 30:11.142
Guys, there's a shark.

30:11.142 --> 30:12.433
Mia, what is it?

30:12.475 --> 30:14.308
There's a
shark. I'm serious.

30:14.725 --> 30:15.767
It killed Ben.

30:15.933 --> 30:16.558
What?

30:16.600 --> 30:19.725
We have to go.
We have to go now.

30:19.850 --> 30:21.767
You're really
freaking me out right now.

30:21.808 --> 30:24.475
Guys, if this is some
kind of joke, it's not funny.

30:24.517 --> 30:25.517
Sasha, behind you!

30:25.558 --> 30:27.767
Yeah, right.

30:27.808 --> 30:30.350
Shark!

30:40.100 --> 30:42.100
Swim! Swim! Go on!

30:49.308 --> 30:51.308
Guys, come
on, move! Move!

30:56.225 --> 30:59.183
The tunnel is starting to
collapse. We need to hurry.

31:08.683 --> 31:10.725
Keep
going, come on, go, go!

31:12.308 --> 31:14.642
Alexa!

31:27.267 --> 31:29.933
What do I do,
Alexa, what do I do?

31:30.517 --> 31:33.142
Push. Help me push. Come on.

31:35.850 --> 31:36.850
Push.

31:37.433 --> 31:39.183
Help me move these rocks.

31:42.058 --> 31:42.892
Push.

31:42.933 --> 31:43.808
We're trapped.

31:43.850 --> 31:45.725
There has
to be a way out.

31:46.558 --> 31:47.558
Come on.

31:48.183 --> 31:52.308
You guys, it's
pointless. It's pointless.
Alexa! Alexa!

31:55.100 --> 31:57.767
Alexa! Look at me.

31:58.058 --> 32:01.100
You said Ben and my Dad
went through a different
entrance.

32:01.183 --> 32:05.267
Sasha, this place is a
maze. I would never be able to
find him.

32:06.475 --> 32:09.267
Guys! Guys,
there's a line.

32:09.433 --> 32:12.808
Ben... Ben, he had the
guideline with him.

32:13.225 --> 32:15.433
It leads back to where
they were working.

32:15.475 --> 32:16.683
What about the shark?

32:16.767 --> 32:19.017
It looked blind.
Like the tetra fish.

32:19.933 --> 32:21.850
It must have
evolved down here.

32:22.392 --> 32:25.475
When my dad opened up the new
cave, it must have let him
through.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.433
Mia, was
that a great white?

32:27.725 --> 32:28.975
Yeah, I think so.

32:32.267 --> 32:33.767
Everybody check your air.

32:34.142 --> 32:35.975
I have about
forty percent left.

32:36.308 --> 32:37.600
What about you guys?

32:39.725 --> 32:41.642
I have forty.

32:41.683 --> 32:42.850
Thirty eight.

32:43.017 --> 32:44.183
Thirty five.

32:45.517 --> 32:48.642
Okay, we don't have much of a
choice, as far as I can see.

32:49.767 --> 32:51.642
Everyone needs to
stay close, okay?

32:52.058 --> 32:53.558
But what
about the shark?

32:54.100 --> 32:57.267
We can do this,
Alexa. It's going to be okay.

32:59.017 --> 33:00.850
Okay, come on. Let's go.

34:10.516 --> 34:11.600
The guideline.

34:11.725 --> 34:13.183
I can see it.

34:23.141 --> 34:24.600
Stay close.

34:24.641 --> 34:27.058
If we follow the line,
it will take us to Grant.

34:27.100 --> 34:28.850
Yeah. Come on, let's go.

35:18.892 --> 35:20.475
The line leads down here.

35:33.517 --> 35:34.517
This way.

35:42.517 --> 35:43.892
Are you okay, Mia?

35:43.975 --> 35:44.975
Yeah.

37:16.350 --> 37:19.642
Oh, my God!
What is this place?

37:24.600 --> 37:28.225
Catacombs. This city was
built out of their burial
chambers.

37:30.392 --> 37:32.308
The line's
caught on something.

37:38.225 --> 37:41.642
Come on. Sasha, we need to move.

37:47.183 --> 37:48.183
Guys.

37:53.392 --> 37:54.725
What are we going to do?

37:54.725 --> 37:56.183
We need to keep going.

37:57.933 --> 37:59.517
We're going to die down here.

38:02.392 --> 38:04.142
No. Grant
has to be close.

38:05.100 --> 38:06.517
We can't give up.

39:01.142 --> 39:04.267
No, no, it's a dead end.
We have to go back.

39:04.392 --> 39:06.600
There's no other way.
Where are we going to go back
to?

39:06.683 --> 39:09.517
We're going to run out
of air. We're going to drown.

39:09.767 --> 39:10.933
We're going to drown!

39:11.142 --> 39:12.142
Wait! Wait!

39:25.225 --> 39:28.683
Where are they?
Sasha, where's Dad?

39:29.183 --> 39:31.683
He must be close. Grant!

39:31.808 --> 39:33.267
- Dad!
- Grant!

39:33.308 --> 39:35.558
- Dad! Where are you, Dad?
- Grant!

39:35.600 --> 39:37.308
- Dad!
- Grant, can you hear us?

39:37.433 --> 39:38.767
There's
another way through.

39:40.642 --> 39:42.433
Get down!

41:14.683 --> 41:15.433
Turn it off!

41:25.850 --> 41:26.767
This way.

41:31.142 --> 41:32.475
Keep going.

41:33.767 --> 41:34.892
Go! Go now!

41:37.475 --> 41:38.475
Come on!

41:39.642 --> 41:41.475
Come on, get in! Go!

41:54.600 --> 41:55.767
This way!

41:59.975 --> 42:01.600
Come on!

42:02.683 --> 42:04.058
This way! Let's go!

42:05.225 --> 42:06.642
Hurry! Come on!

42:25.850 --> 42:27.433
Did the shark follow us?

42:27.892 --> 42:29.267
I think we're safe here.

42:29.933 --> 42:32.392
It's too narrow for
the shark to follow.

42:34.517 --> 42:36.475
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

42:43.225 --> 42:45.892
Guys, the
air tastes bad.

42:47.433 --> 42:49.558
It's an air pocket.
It's been here a while.

42:49.642 --> 42:51.267
We can't breathe it for long.

42:51.350 --> 42:52.350
So what do we do?

42:55.933 --> 42:58.058
I can't see
any way out of here.

43:03.683 --> 43:05.017
How much air
do you have left?

43:06.933 --> 43:08.642
I've got
twenty two percent.

43:08.767 --> 43:10.767
- I'm on twenty.
- Nineteen.

43:11.267 --> 43:12.267
Twenty one.

43:14.433 --> 43:15.475
Do you hear that?

43:16.433 --> 43:19.850
Shhh. Listen. Listen.

43:20.308 --> 43:21.933
I think it's music.

43:22.058 --> 43:23.683
- That's impossible.
- Yeah.

43:26.183 --> 43:27.600
It's coming
from over here.

43:36.058 --> 43:37.600
It has to be my Dad.

43:43.933 --> 43:45.267
It's a dead end.

43:48.017 --> 43:49.058
ALEXA, SASHA, NICOLE: Mia!

43:50.267 --> 43:52.017
'The
Look' by Roxette).

44:04.017 --> 44:05.975
Mia! Mia, are you okay?

44:06.058 --> 44:07.308
- There's a gap.
- Okay?

44:07.308 --> 44:08.975
- Yeah. I can get through.
- Okay.

44:09.017 --> 44:10.433
I'll let you know
when I'm on the other side.

44:10.433 --> 44:12.017
No. We should
stay together.

44:12.017 --> 44:13.892
There's no point in all
of us using our air.

44:14.725 --> 44:16.017
Are you sure
you can do this?

44:16.058 --> 44:17.392
- Yeah.
- Please be careful.

44:17.392 --> 44:18.850
- Okay.
- Okay, we're going to be right here.

44:18.892 --> 44:20.683
- Yeah.
- Okay.

45:31.725 --> 45:32.892
Dad!

45:51.058 --> 45:53.183
I was mid jam right now.

45:57.142 --> 45:58.350
Grant?

46:00.558 --> 46:01.558
Ben?

46:24.017 --> 46:26.892
Come on, guys.
Seriously, stop messing around.

46:31.225 --> 46:34.183
Track error. Please reset.

46:34.475 --> 46:36.600
Track error. Please reset.

46:37.725 --> 46:40.267
Track error. Please reset.

46:41.058 --> 46:43.392
Track error.

47:14.642 --> 47:15.642
What?

47:48.392 --> 47:49.642
What is that?

47:50.808 --> 47:52.392
It's an emergency alarm.

47:52.475 --> 47:54.975
Designed to help locate a diver
in a cave.

47:55.058 --> 47:55.850
Dad!

48:16.975 --> 48:18.142
I'm through.

48:19.225 --> 48:20.933
Can you see anything?

48:21.267 --> 48:22.392
Dad?

48:27.100 --> 48:29.475
I can't see anything,
but I can hear the alarm.

48:30.517 --> 48:31.517
Carl?

48:35.850 --> 48:36.850
Dad!

48:41.392 --> 48:43.350
I see it! I see the alarm!

49:00.142 --> 49:01.142
Dad!

49:39.933 --> 49:40.933
Dad!

49:46.350 --> 49:47.558
Guys!

49:49.808 --> 49:52.142
Guys,
I can't hear you!

49:52.892 --> 49:54.017
Dad!

49:56.975 --> 49:59.183
Dad! Help!

50:05.892 --> 50:07.350
Why isn't she back yet?

50:11.933 --> 50:14.433
Mia! Mia!

50:15.225 --> 50:16.225
Mia!

50:21.308 --> 50:24.225
She's not responding.
We have to go help her.

50:24.850 --> 50:26.392
What if the
shark got her?

50:26.392 --> 50:29.392
Guys, guys, I'm lost.
I can't hear you.

50:29.433 --> 50:30.642
Can you hear me?

50:34.392 --> 50:36.058
Guys, I can't hear you.

50:42.058 --> 50:43.267
Can you hear me?

51:00.267 --> 51:01.725
What
are you doing here?

51:01.767 --> 51:05.142
We just wanted to see the main
entrance, but then the tunnel
collapsed.

51:06.183 --> 51:08.225
Ben and Carl are both dead.

51:11.517 --> 51:12.642
Where's Sasha?

51:13.475 --> 51:14.975
We found a
small air pocket.

51:15.017 --> 51:18.183
She's back there with
Alexa and Nicole, but I can't
hear them any more.

51:18.225 --> 51:21.100
It's because these
columns are breaking up the
radio signal.

51:21.933 --> 51:23.058
You're low on air.

51:33.267 --> 51:36.683
- We'll get them. Follow me.
- Okay.

52:24.392 --> 52:26.683
Mia! Mia,
behind you!

52:29.267 --> 52:31.975
Over here! Over here!

52:38.433 --> 52:40.350
Hey! Over here!

52:42.642 --> 52:44.267
Over here!

52:47.642 --> 52:50.392
Over here! Over here!

52:58.850 --> 52:59.850
Swim!

53:09.392 --> 53:10.392
This way!

53:55.433 --> 53:56.642
Swim! Come on!

54:36.308 --> 54:38.850
We did it!

54:41.850 --> 54:43.558
Oh, Mia!

54:44.725 --> 54:46.392
You guys!

54:46.433 --> 54:47.683
I love you guys!

54:47.725 --> 54:50.017
- We made it!
- You saved us, Mia!

54:50.850 --> 54:53.100
I thought we were
going to die down there.

54:53.350 --> 54:55.683
Okay, girls,
this is an ascender.

54:57.600 --> 54:59.683
You got to get
yourself into this harness.

55:00.100 --> 55:01.600
Get your
foot in this loop.

55:02.600 --> 55:05.892
And this, you got to
work up and down.

55:06.058 --> 55:08.642
Pump down, push up.
Pump down, push up.

55:08.767 --> 55:10.475
- Yeah.
- Okay?

55:10.517 --> 55:12.225
- Yeah.
- We'll get out of here soon.

55:12.267 --> 55:13.642
- Okay.
- You ready?

55:13.683 --> 55:15.642
- Yeah.
- Okay. Push.

55:16.600 --> 55:19.850
Yeah! You got to
use all your strength.

55:19.892 --> 55:22.350
- Okay.
- Push and pull.

55:22.475 --> 55:23.683
That's it, yeah!

55:23.808 --> 55:25.350
I'm a natural.

55:25.350 --> 55:27.350
- Alright, go back. Come on.
- Okay.

55:27.433 --> 55:28.975
One more time.
Hard as you can.

55:29.517 --> 55:31.017
- Yeah.
- Okay.

55:31.058 --> 55:32.808
Okay.

55:33.350 --> 55:36.392
Yeah! Keep going.

55:39.475 --> 55:42.058
Guys!
Guys, there's a shark!

55:46.267 --> 55:48.017
Get me out of here!

55:51.350 --> 55:53.142
Nicole,
I can't pull us both up.

55:53.225 --> 55:54.350
Get off, Nicole!

55:54.392 --> 55:55.642
I got
to get out of here!

55:56.642 --> 55:58.267
It's not going to
hold both of you.

56:00.642 --> 56:02.642
- Let go, Nicole!
- Alexa!

56:03.183 --> 56:05.433
Nicole, you
got to get down!

56:05.558 --> 56:07.642
Oh, my God, there's two sharks!

56:14.475 --> 56:15.725
- No!
- Alexa!

56:16.892 --> 56:18.850
I got to
get out of here! I'm sorry!

56:22.100 --> 56:23.308
- No!
- Please let go!

56:27.975 --> 56:28.975
Alexa!

56:39.892 --> 56:42.225
Unhook yourself from
that harness right now!

56:43.017 --> 56:43.975
Unhook yourself!

57:40.017 --> 57:41.933
Alexa!

57:46.100 --> 57:47.767
- Girls!
- Mia, quick!

57:49.558 --> 57:52.142
Help! Someone help!

57:52.183 --> 57:53.558
Nobody can
hear you, Alexa.

57:53.600 --> 57:55.517
Someone will hear us.

57:55.725 --> 57:56.767
They'll hear this.

57:59.475 --> 58:02.767
Help! Someone help!

58:03.850 --> 58:07.267
- Help! Please!
- Alexa, no one can hear you.

58:07.517 --> 58:09.975
- Turn it off!
- Girls. Girls.

58:10.017 --> 58:10.767
- Shut it off!
- Don't!

58:10.808 --> 58:13.475
Girls! Girls! Look!

58:16.808 --> 58:18.017
They're gone.

58:27.267 --> 58:28.267
Where did they go?

58:31.433 --> 58:32.683
They're scared of it.

58:33.517 --> 58:34.892
The sharks... they've
evolved blind,

58:34.975 --> 58:36.892
and they have a heightened
sense of hearing.

58:37.100 --> 58:38.850
It must
be the frequency.

58:38.892 --> 58:41.308
Maybe we can use the
alarm to scare them away.

58:41.433 --> 58:42.600
I mean, someone's
going to come looking

58:42.642 --> 58:44.517
for us when we don't come
back tonight, right?

58:44.558 --> 58:46.892
The only people that
know where we are, are right
here.

58:46.975 --> 58:48.475
I just found the
entrance to this cave.

58:48.475 --> 58:50.517
I'm the only one
who knows where it is.

58:51.142 --> 58:53.975
And there's no way we
can get back up without the
ascender.

58:56.392 --> 58:57.642
What are we going to do?

58:59.808 --> 59:01.558
We got to go back down.
There's no other way now.

59:01.600 --> 59:02.642
- What?
- What?

59:02.642 --> 59:05.475
Listen, this cave
goes out to the sea.

59:05.558 --> 59:07.475
If we follow it, we'll
come out in the ocean.

59:08.058 --> 59:11.142
There'll be strong
currents there that are going to
try and suck us down.

59:11.225 --> 59:12.892
So we're going to
have to keep together.

59:12.933 --> 59:13.808
No. We're going
to die down there.

59:13.850 --> 59:15.600
If we stay
here, we'll die.

59:15.892 --> 59:17.975
We're going to watch
each other's backs.

59:18.100 --> 59:19.642
And we can survive this.

59:20.350 --> 59:22.225
Okay? Girls, I believe in you.

59:29.850 --> 59:30.850
Dad!

59:30.975 --> 59:33.058
Dad! Dad!

59:39.100 --> 59:39.600
No!

59:39.642 --> 59:41.808
Mia, get
back! Mia, get back!

59:41.808 --> 59:43.433
Sound the alarm!

59:47.225 --> 59:48.225
Are they gone?

59:53.100 --> 59:55.725
Are they gone? Can you see it?

59:55.850 --> 59:57.683
I don't see it. I don't see it.

01:00:03.225 --> 01:00:04.600
What are we going to do?

01:00:07.267 --> 01:00:08.558
We have to do what he said.

01:00:08.683 --> 01:00:10.517
- No!
- Yes, we have to go back down.

01:00:10.933 --> 01:00:14.558
I can't. I can't do
this. I can't. I can't.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:15.808
Mia, we have to go.
We have to do what he said.

01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:17.683
We have to go back down.

01:00:17.767 --> 01:00:19.558
He wouldn't want
you to give up now, okay?

01:00:20.267 --> 01:00:21.725
Do we even have enough air?

01:00:24.142 --> 01:00:25.142
We have no choice.

01:00:26.183 --> 01:00:27.142
What if we're wrong?

01:00:27.225 --> 01:00:30.600
What if the alarm has nothing to
do with why the sharks are gone?

01:00:30.725 --> 01:00:31.725
We got to try.

01:00:35.308 --> 01:00:36.308
You ready?

01:01:57.850 --> 01:01:59.892
I can't see them.
Where did they go?

01:02:01.183 --> 01:02:04.017
Wait. Current!

01:02:24.892 --> 01:02:26.850
Sasha!
Give me your hand!

01:02:30.433 --> 01:02:31.433
No!

01:02:43.808 --> 01:02:44.850
Help me!

01:02:45.142 --> 01:02:46.933
No! No!

01:02:46.975 --> 01:02:48.975
Give me your hand!
Come on, I got you.

01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:50.308
Help!

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.683
Come on, I
got you. Come on.

01:02:59.892 --> 01:03:02.142
I can't hold on!

01:03:02.267 --> 01:03:03.767
The current is too strong!

01:03:04.558 --> 01:03:06.350
Come on! Hold on!
Give me your hand!

01:03:06.392 --> 01:03:08.558
- I can't hold on!
- Mia, help! I'm falling!

01:03:13.517 --> 01:03:15.350
Mia! I'm slipping!

01:03:17.475 --> 01:03:19.058
Hold on, Sasha, come on.

01:03:26.933 --> 01:03:28.392
No! No!

01:03:28.433 --> 01:03:29.308
Sasha!

01:03:29.350 --> 01:03:32.100
No! No! Mia!

01:03:35.475 --> 01:03:36.725
Sasha!

01:03:44.017 --> 01:03:45.517
Sasha!

01:03:47.642 --> 01:03:49.100
Sasha!

01:04:05.683 --> 01:04:08.267
No! Sasha!

01:04:09.308 --> 01:04:12.100
Mia! Mia, she's dead.
There's nothing you can do.

01:04:12.142 --> 01:04:13.683
No, you don't know that.

01:04:13.725 --> 01:04:14.767
Mia, look at me.

01:04:15.433 --> 01:04:16.850
I'm going.

01:04:16.975 --> 01:04:18.225
Mia, look at me.

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:21.558
We have to keep going,
or we are going to die down
here.

01:04:21.808 --> 01:04:23.475
Do you understand me?

01:04:23.558 --> 01:04:24.558
No!

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:34.225
Look. Over there.

01:04:34.767 --> 01:04:35.892
That's the way out.

01:04:36.642 --> 01:04:39.142
The current is
going to drag us down.

01:04:43.808 --> 01:04:46.267
We'll be okay if
we stick to the side.

01:04:46.308 --> 01:04:48.308
It's our
only chance. Okay?

01:04:48.433 --> 01:04:50.308
Okay? I won't leave you.

01:04:50.350 --> 01:04:52.267
Grab my hand. Let's go.

01:05:32.308 --> 01:05:33.433
You okay?

01:05:49.975 --> 01:05:50.975
Keep moving.

01:05:54.017 --> 01:05:55.600
Almost there.

01:05:57.558 --> 01:05:59.350
Mia! Give me your hand!

01:05:59.392 --> 01:06:01.058
- Alexa!
- Give me your hand!

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:03.058
I'm coming. I'm coming.

01:06:03.433 --> 01:06:05.225
Grab my
hand! Grab my hand!

01:06:08.225 --> 01:06:10.183
I got you! I got you!

01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:17.850
Are you okay?

01:06:38.683 --> 01:06:40.642
Mia, this has
to be the way out.

01:06:40.725 --> 01:06:41.808
We're almost there.

01:06:42.808 --> 01:06:44.308
The exit can't be far.

01:06:48.183 --> 01:06:48.975
Alexa!

01:08:01.642 --> 01:08:03.183
Oh, my
God, you're alive!

01:08:05.308 --> 01:08:06.600
You're alive!

01:08:06.683 --> 01:08:07.975
We're trapped, Mia!

01:08:10.350 --> 01:08:14.017
Mia, we're going
to die. There's no way out.

01:08:15.517 --> 01:08:18.600
I'm
sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:08:18.725 --> 01:08:19.433
Don't be.

01:08:19.475 --> 01:08:23.100
No, no! it's my fault.
If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't
be here.

01:08:23.142 --> 01:08:25.642
Stop! You stop it, okay?

01:08:27.683 --> 01:08:29.017
We can't give up now.

01:08:30.183 --> 01:08:33.392
We can share air.
I have a little more than you.

01:08:34.142 --> 01:08:35.433
Five percent.

01:08:35.808 --> 01:08:37.517
We're not going
to die down here.

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:43.475
- Look!
- Where are you going? Mia?

01:08:59.683 --> 01:09:00.850
Sasha, come here.

01:09:04.267 --> 01:09:06.933
Look. Maybe
there's a way through.

01:09:09.017 --> 01:09:11.642
The current is too
strong, it'll drag us down.

01:09:12.725 --> 01:09:13.933
We have to try.

01:10:41.683 --> 01:10:42.850
It's a dead end.

01:10:44.267 --> 01:10:45.642
No, it can't be.

01:10:54.017 --> 01:10:55.600
There! Come on!

01:11:13.475 --> 01:11:15.058
I think I can
see the sunlight.

01:11:16.475 --> 01:11:18.392
It's too narrow
to climb through.

01:11:18.475 --> 01:11:20.058
There must be another way.

01:11:34.892 --> 01:11:38.142
It's circling.
Oh, my God! Mia!

01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:40.642
Mia! I'm stuck!

01:11:43.475 --> 01:11:44.975
Mia! It's coming!

01:11:54.892 --> 01:11:56.850
I'm stuck! I'm stuck!

01:12:13.058 --> 01:12:16.642
Keep going. We can
do it. We can make it.

01:12:18.517 --> 01:12:21.392
Just keep going.
We're almost there.

01:12:23.517 --> 01:12:24.683
Come on, Mia!

01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:32.767
Come on, Mia! Keep going!

01:12:41.267 --> 01:12:43.058
Come on, Mia.

01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:44.350
I see light.

01:12:52.225 --> 01:12:55.058
Come on. We're so close.

01:12:56.933 --> 01:12:58.058
Mia, I'm stuck.

01:13:01.183 --> 01:13:02.517
We're so close.

01:13:07.725 --> 01:13:09.267
I have to
take my pack off.

01:13:11.642 --> 01:13:12.642
Come on.

01:13:24.808 --> 01:13:25.975
Hold your breath.

01:13:45.975 --> 01:13:47.017
Help!

01:13:49.392 --> 01:13:50.392
Help!

01:14:31.142 --> 01:14:34.600
Oh, my God! Mia! Mia!

01:14:34.725 --> 01:14:38.975
Mia! We
made it! We did it!

01:15:00.892 --> 01:15:02.225
There has to be a way up.

01:15:04.933 --> 01:15:07.100
Maybe, maybe
we could climb it.

01:15:07.142 --> 01:15:09.517
Mia! Mia!

01:15:09.558 --> 01:15:10.975
Mia, look!

01:15:11.017 --> 01:15:15.517
- Oh, my God! Help! Help!
- Help! Over here!

01:15:15.642 --> 01:15:19.517
- Help! Help!
- Help! Help! Help!

01:15:19.558 --> 01:15:21.808
- Help!
- Over here!

01:15:21.933 --> 01:15:23.350
Mia, we have to swim.

01:15:23.433 --> 01:15:25.350
We have to
swim. We can do it.

01:15:25.392 --> 01:15:27.433
Help! Help!

01:15:28.975 --> 01:15:29.933
Come on.

01:15:30.183 --> 01:15:31.517
Over here!

01:15:32.225 --> 01:15:33.350
Help!

01:15:37.683 --> 01:15:38.683
Wait.

01:15:59.850 --> 01:16:02.058
Oh, my God, it's chum! No!

01:16:22.017 --> 01:16:24.100
Whoa!
Come over here.

01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:26.100
Move!

01:17:00.475 --> 01:17:02.933
Oh, my God!

01:17:03.058 --> 01:17:04.933
Are you
all seeing this?

01:17:57.475 --> 01:17:58.433
Stay back! Stay back!

01:17:58.558 --> 01:17:59.558
Sasha!

01:18:03.767 --> 01:18:05.017
Get out of my way!

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:11.892
Move!

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:51.517
Come on! Come on!

01:19:50.058 --> 01:19:51.433
Watch out!

01:20:25.308 --> 01:20:26.308
You're okay?

01:20:30.308 --> 01:20:32.267
Look at me. Look at me.

01:20:32.808 --> 01:20:34.975
Breathe. Breathe.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.725
Yeah.

01:20:37.433 --> 01:20:38.808
Yeah. Yeah. You're okay.
