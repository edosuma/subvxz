Hey, Tilly, have you
seen my slingshot?

‐This, dear brother,

for Father's Day.

00:16.266 --> 00:17.601
Father's Day?
Oh, dang, that's today?

00:17.601 --> 00:19.061
I totally forgot.

00:19.061 --> 00:20.896
[stretches] Well,
guess it's time to whip up

00:20.896 --> 00:22.231
the ol' Cricket standard!

aaand...

00:41.834 --> 00:44.878
Aw, what the heck,
Dad never cashes these in, so...

00:44.878 --> 00:47.631
I will paint
the whole house.

00:47.631 --> 00:50.592
Cricket! Those coupons
are not a real gift!

ten seconds to make!

01:11.822 --> 01:14.408
Well, there's no way
you're gettin' away
with that again this year.

you're working too hard.

Dad's gonna react
just the same way to my gift

No, Cricket.
I know Papa is lying
about liking those coupons.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.652
And I know
how we can prove it.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.362
All right, sister,
I'm in.

a terrible gift,

04:14.963 --> 04:16.757

about liking it,

04:16.757 --> 04:19.384

about your Cricket Coupons.

He was just being nice
to you, brother.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.181
Mm, I dunno. Dad's still
wearing that thing.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.850
Maybe you're just really good
at making stuff for him!

Hmm, you might be right.

that Papa could never love.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.194
‐Oh, no, not...
‐Yes!

04:37.194 --> 04:39.946
We can't do that to Dad.
He birthed us!

to overcome your fears
an excellent present?

Papa, what do you think
of this heartfelt gift

05:56.398 --> 05:58.692
from your loving children?

08:41.896 --> 08:42.981
[shuddering]

08:42.981 --> 08:44.983
Made it! Go Gramma.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.527
Guess I should see
which card I grabbed.

08:47.527 --> 08:51.573
"With deepest sympathy.
So sorry for your loss."

08:51.573 --> 08:53.950
Eh. I can work with that.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.833
Now, that
is how you build a dam.

09:01.833 --> 09:04.419
Quit talking to yourself!
Here's a thing.

09:04.419 --> 09:07.255
Hm. Huh! That's certainly me!

09:07.255 --> 09:09.090
Oh, very abstract!

09:09.090 --> 09:12.093
"Dear son, you're a good Dad.
I'm proud of you."

09:12.093 --> 09:14.054
Aw, Ma,
you're the sweetest!

09:14.054 --> 09:15.430
‐Come here!
‐[crunch]

09:15.430 --> 09:16.931
Oh, no!
Did I hug too hard?!

09:16.931 --> 09:19.851
Don't insult me, boy.
This body is cut!

09:19.851 --> 09:22.145
I believe the disturbance
came from outside.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.229
Hmm.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.981
[gasp] Tilly!

09:24.981 --> 09:26.399
What the heck
are you doing?

09:26.399 --> 09:27.650
I'm sorry, Papa.

09:27.650 --> 09:30.195
I should have done this
a while ago.

09:30.195 --> 09:31.488
‐[Tilly grunts]
‐[jug shatters]

09:31.488 --> 09:32.989
But sadly, I was oblivious

09:32.989 --> 09:35.075
to the crumminess of my gifts.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.951
Wait, wait, wait, waaiit!

09:36.951 --> 09:38.161
Wait! Oof!

09:38.161 --> 09:39.954
[gasp] Sorry about that!

09:39.954 --> 09:41.456
Oof. Ahh...

09:41.456 --> 09:43.041
Heh heh, barely felt it!

09:43.041 --> 09:44.459
[groans]

09:44.459 --> 09:46.669
Sweetie,
your gifts aren't crummy.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.838
I really do
like your presents.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.298
I don't
always understand 'em,

09:50.298 --> 09:51.674
but I do like 'em.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.718
But why should I try
to make something special

09:53.718 --> 09:56.763
if you like 'em just the same
as Cricket Coupons?

09:56.763 --> 09:58.640
Gift giving
isn't a competition.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.351
We give gifts so we can
share a bit of ourselves.

10:01.351 --> 10:05.063
For you, that means sharing
something thoughtful,
sweet, and original.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.190
Because that's who you are.

10:07.190 --> 10:11.945
Also, I like that your gifts
often have an excellent use
of craft materials.

10:11.945 --> 10:16.449
Mmm. Can you keep making me
Tilly gifts? Please?

10:16.449 --> 10:18.785
‐Okay.
‐Yes!

10:18.785 --> 10:21.871
You know, all this talk of
Cricket's Coupons reminded me.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.790
I've been holding
onto these for years.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.291
What say we cash some in?

10:25.291 --> 10:27.460
Papa, I would love
nothing more.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.462
[laughing]

10:29.462 --> 10:30.463
Uh‐oh.
