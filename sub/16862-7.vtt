00:01.042 --> 00:02.627
<i>Previously on</i> Rescue me...

00:02.627 --> 00:05.588
- You must be the new probie, eh?
- Sean.

00:05.588 --> 00:08.466
He doesn't cook, he doesn't clean.
He doesn't scrub, he doesn't shine.

00:08.591 --> 00:09.968
He doesn't get his balls busted.

00:09.968 --> 00:12.429
- What does he do?
- He plays hoops.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.889
Oh! Oh!

00:14.889 --> 00:19.436
Is this Tommy's remote control?
Are these his sunglasses?

00:19.561 --> 00:22.647
I just wanted to, you know,
a little something of his

00:22.772 --> 00:24.441
just wanted a little piece
of Tommy for myself.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.235
<i>Hey, Franco, it's Alicia.</i>

00:27.777 --> 00:28.778
<i>Call me, baby.</i>

00:29.654 --> 00:32.157
- So what?
- So, go see her.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.950
- What?
- Go see, Alicia.

00:33.950 --> 00:37.370
You say, your absolutely sure
I'm all you want. So, go see her.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.664
I want you to give me that, baby.

00:39.664 --> 00:41.958
- You're crazy.
- No, no, I hate it when you call me crazy.

00:41.958 --> 00:44.377
Just listen to me.
I love this baby.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.337
And that baby loves me.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.173
I'll tell you what you
should be sorry about.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.758
Give me that
bullshit story about

00:49.758 --> 00:51.509
how I couldn't get it up
the night of the fire.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.636
<i>So you can get your
hands on the insurance money.</i>

00:53.636 --> 00:56.389
And now you are gonna use
that insurance money to try and buy my...

00:56.389 --> 00:58.892
My son, or my brother's son
or whatever the hell he is. Huh?

00:58.892 --> 01:00.810
I'm sorry that it
sounds so cold.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.812
But Jesus Christ,
he doesn't even have a name yet.

01:03.646 --> 01:05.023
Okay, where are the batteries?

01:05.148 --> 01:08.026
I thought we were supposed to be having
a break from the sex, okay.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.527
Getting to know each other.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.946
It has taken me 35 years
to start having sex.

01:11.946 --> 01:13.281
Thirty five years okay?

01:13.281 --> 01:15.492
Don't make me feel
dirty for having an appetite.

01:15.617 --> 01:18.161
Most guys you know
they would kill to be in your shoes.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.663
Oh!

01:20.955 --> 01:22.332
Kenny, are you okay?

01:22.832 --> 01:24.334
Just get out of my house.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.295
Dude, this is a complete misunderstanding.

01:27.712 --> 01:31.424
I understand completely.
You screwed the woman I loved.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.927
<i>Well, I snuck into
Mike's mom's house like you told me to.</i>

01:34.052 --> 01:35.178
<i>I found what he was hiding.</i>

01:35.512 --> 01:36.846
<i>Gay parents.</i>

01:36.846 --> 01:38.640
<i>Found these pictures
in the back of the closet.</i>

01:38.848 --> 01:40.225
<i>I actually uh...</i>

01:40.558 --> 01:44.813
<i>When I was over there I also
um, set his mom's house on fire.</i>

01:52.362 --> 01:53.696
We caught a live one.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.990
Two floors involved, third
and fourth about to happen.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.117
Saddle up, boys.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.119
All right, probie,
I hope you're ready for this.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.787
You're not supposed
to call me probie.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.789
Hey, I call you what you are,
asshole, all right?

02:02.789 --> 02:04.207
You jump off the rig,

02:04.374 --> 02:05.834
you get on my ass
and you stay there.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.002
Hang on for dear goddamn life.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.809
All right, hold on. Hold on.
All right, 62 is here.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.019
- Sixty-two.
- Sixty-two.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.229
Yeah, what do we got?

02:26.354 --> 02:28.356
Seven-one Truck is up there.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.108
- What?
- Big 71 is parking up.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.360
Got it. Nils, get the ladder.
Come on, let's roll.

02:34.529 --> 02:35.613
What the hell is going on?

02:35.738 --> 02:38.408
Oh, Jesus Christ! Tom!

02:38.408 --> 02:39.701
Jesus Christ.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.787
Tommy, get the probie,
get in the bucket.

02:43.037 --> 02:45.039
Raise the ladder, Nils.
Let's go.

02:45.039 --> 02:48.001
Nils, get that fucking bucket closer.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.086
That's as close as it'll get.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.718
<i>Stone cold</i>

03:38.718 --> 03:42.513
<i>I think I'm taking you home</i>

03:42.639 --> 03:48.645
<i>So I can be broken in two</i>

03:51.064 --> 03:54.192
<i>Just like you</i>

03:57.570 --> 04:02.075
<i>Sexy eyes and c'est la vie</i>

04:02.075 --> 04:05.078
<i>I'll call you sometime</i>

04:05.328 --> 04:09.499
<i>When I'm blue</i>

04:13.211 --> 04:15.171
<i>Blue</i>

04:18.383 --> 04:21.177
<i>Say so</i>

04:21.177 --> 04:24.847
<i>I'm getting under your skin</i>

04:24.973 --> 04:31.604
<i>So soft I can't help but pursue</i>

04:33.690 --> 04:36.943
<i>Till I'm screwed</i>

04:39.654 --> 04:44.867
<i>Sunset, everything's fire</i>

04:44.993 --> 04:49.872
<i>But I can't
Get any higher</i>

04:49.998 --> 04:55.920
<i>Come get this lightning</i>

04:55.920 --> 04:59.215
<i>And rain all over me</i>

05:01.217 --> 05:05.888
<i>Come to
I forget all of it</i>

05:06.389 --> 05:09.100
<i>Someone</i>

05:09.225 --> 05:13.271
<i>I can't remember at all</i>

05:16.232 --> 05:18.651
<i>Is gonna fall</i>

05:23.072 --> 05:26.743
<i>Oh, babe
Without any doubt</i>

05:26.993 --> 05:33.499
<i>There is one thing
I am nothing without, and--</i>

05:33.499 --> 05:36.669
<i>Oh, babe, surely you know</i>

05:36.669 --> 05:40.340
<i>I'll never tell you</i>

05:43.718 --> 05:47.638
<i>Come back down</i>

05:49.223 --> 05:53.102
<i>Come back down</i>

05:54.479 --> 05:58.274
<i>Come</i>

05:58.399 --> 06:01.486
<i>If you're dumb</i>

06:05.656 --> 06:09.452
<i>Oh, babe,
Without any doubt</i>

06:09.577 --> 06:16.250
<i>There is one thing
I am nothing without...</i>

06:16.250 --> 06:19.379
<i>Oh, babe, surely you know</i>

06:19.379 --> 06:24.008
<i>I'll never tell you</i>

06:28.304 --> 06:31.474

<i>With these ropes tied tight
Can we do no wrong?</i>

<i>Of a thousand men
Who have come and gone</i>

09:07.129 --> 09:10.550

Jesus.

09:36.158 --> 09:37.994
I know.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.161
- Hey.
- You all right?

09:39.287 --> 09:41.747
Yeah.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.791
Nice work.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.001
What's wrong?

09:52.842 --> 09:54.176
Hey, we-- We, uh...

09:54.302 --> 09:56.887
Jesus.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.015
They're all burned up, Tom.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.766
- Well, we just--
- They must have--

10:00.766 --> 10:02.518
They must've been dead
before you got there.

10:02.518 --> 10:04.020
No, man, we got them
in the bucket.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.354
We had to go back
and get the mom.

10:05.479 --> 10:08.482
Tommy, we thought
we had three, at least.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.528
We did all we can, man.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.365
Seven?

10:16.490 --> 10:17.867
Seven.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.582
Jesus Christ.

10:24.832 --> 10:29.920
Yeah, well, where the hell
is he right now?

10:54.070 --> 10:55.571
You got it?

10:57.657 --> 10:59.241
I can handle it.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.329
There were seven in there.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.761
- Tom, we did everything we could.
- Yeah.

11:22.264 --> 11:23.766
Yeah.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.839
All right, here's what I'm gonna say.

12:44.764 --> 12:48.100
You know, a lot of us, me included,
we say that the heroes are the guys

12:48.100 --> 12:50.519
that don't make it
back to the house.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.190
Well, tonight,
you're my goddamn heroes.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.399
That was a ball-buster,

12:55.524 --> 12:58.527
and every one of you did what
you were supposed to do,

12:58.778 --> 13:00.321
including the new guy.

13:00.321 --> 13:04.200
I'm goddamn proud to be
working with a crew like this.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.826
Any minute now,
that alarm's gonna go

13:05.826 --> 13:07.161
and we will have to make a run

13:07.161 --> 13:09.872
because some fat broad
got her big ass stuck in a tub,

13:09.872 --> 13:12.833
or some asshole went off the
rails on the West Side Highway.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.710
He's all banged up
but he's still alive

13:14.835 --> 13:16.295
because he's high
as a goddamn kite.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.088
And we are gonna
answer those calls

13:18.214 --> 13:20.549
the same way we answered
this one tonight.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.887
Balls to the wall, gentlemen.

13:28.224 --> 13:31.560
Anybody needs me,
I'm gonna be in my office.

13:31.811 --> 13:32.978
Call my wife and kids,

13:32.978 --> 13:35.648
and I'm gonna have a nice
big mug of Jack Daniels.

13:42.404 --> 13:44.281
- Kid.
- Yeah.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.451
Good job tonight.

13:47.576 --> 13:51.038
Not just the save on that kid, but...

13:51.038 --> 13:52.414
You know.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.416
Pulling me in when
I was going off the side.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.793
That was good.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.337
Thanks, bro. Thanks.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.062
I'm sick of macaroni and cheese.

14:15.062 --> 14:17.356
Well, eat it anyway.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.442
Where's the phone?

14:20.568 --> 14:22.111
How the hell should I know?

14:22.236 --> 14:24.530
Hey. Watch your mouth, young lady.

14:26.699 --> 14:27.908
Hello?

14:27.908 --> 14:29.368
Hey.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.619
How you doing?

14:30.619 --> 14:31.787
How am I doing?

14:31.787 --> 14:33.122
Hey.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.623
Go back there, sit back there,

14:34.832 --> 14:36.417
- and finish your food.
- I don't want it!

14:36.417 --> 14:38.127
And keep your voice down.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.879
Get back here.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.339
Oh, goddamn it,
Kathleen Marie Gavin,

14:42.464 --> 14:45.009
get your ass back to this table.

14:48.846 --> 14:49.889
What do you want?

14:49.889 --> 14:52.141
I'm just, uh, calling, checking in.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.976
See how, you know,

14:54.101 --> 14:55.644
- making sure you guys are okay.
- Yeah.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.104
We're all right.
What gives?

14:59.648 --> 15:01.817
Nothing, honey, I just...

15:01.942 --> 15:04.528
What, you called to say nothing?

15:04.653 --> 15:08.616
I-- I called because I was
just thinking of you guys and...

15:09.825 --> 15:11.327
What?

15:11.327 --> 15:13.913
All right, so Katy's in a bad mood?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.998
Yeah.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.374
She's not near the baby, is she?

15:17.499 --> 15:19.627
Oh, Jesus, no.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.003
Thank God, he's fast asleep.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.171
How?

15:22.171 --> 15:23.672
What do you mean how?

15:23.881 --> 15:25.633
Benadryl.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.218
What?

15:28.344 --> 15:30.095
Well, I didn't say anything.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.097
Yeah, you didn't have to.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.849
Look, just remember that Katy and I

15:33.974 --> 15:35.935
are going to that truck show
tomorrow night.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.353
Yeah, I got it. Yeah.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.063
Mm-hm. And Colleen called,
by the way.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.606
She needs more money.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.149
Okay. Um...

15:42.149 --> 15:43.359
Okay?

15:43.484 --> 15:44.902
That's all that you have to say?

15:45.027 --> 15:47.571
Well, I'll-- I'll go over
there and, you know--

15:47.696 --> 15:48.697
Yeah, you're gonna call her

15:48.948 --> 15:51.158
and end up forking over
another 400 bucks or so

15:51.158 --> 15:52.368
that we can't afford,

15:52.368 --> 15:55.371
to buy her some jeans
or a new chair or whatever

15:55.496 --> 15:58.582
to try to get her to stay
in contact with you.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.042
- Honey.
- Hello?

16:00.042 --> 16:01.543
What?

16:04.546 --> 16:06.048
I gotta go.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.606
Hey.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.486
Hate to say I told you so,
but told you so.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.488
What?

17:12.614 --> 17:13.657
Hey.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.170
<i>In other news,
it's been confirmed now</i>

18:08.295 --> 18:11.673
<i>that a total of seven children
and one female adult have died</i>

18:11.673 --> 18:14.510
<i>in what has become known
as the baby fire.</i>

18:14.510 --> 18:16.178
<i>- Last night...</i>
- Come on, guys.

18:16.678 --> 18:18.222
Hey. Yo.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.267
The mom died last night.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.477
- What?
- Yeah.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.062
She was fine when we left.

18:25.187 --> 18:28.357
Yeah, her heart gave out at the hospital.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.611
Read them and weep, guys.

18:34.488 --> 18:37.533
Needles won't be up today.
I sent him back over to his family.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.159
Jesus Christ.

18:39.159 --> 18:40.410
It was a mess, chief.

18:40.577 --> 18:42.746
One of the worst I ever saw.

18:42.871 --> 18:44.206
Papers say it was a space heater.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.958
First floor, the curtains went up

18:45.958 --> 18:48.877
and the mother runs
out of the apartment

18:48.877 --> 18:50.921
to warn the neighbors.
She leaves the door open.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.214
The fire follows her right up.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.591
Up the stairs
like a goddamn chimney.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.844
I talked to Eddie
and he's over there right now.

18:56.844 --> 19:01.557
He says the goddamn staircase
is alligatored.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.642
It didn't stand a chance.

19:03.767 --> 19:04.935
Oh shit, sorry, guys.

19:06.186 --> 19:07.229
Sorry.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.524
Hey, guys.

19:10.524 --> 19:11.775
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.570
- The mom died, Garrity.
- You're kidding.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.029
It's a sin.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.906
Shit.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.119
Oh, boy.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.914
Well, all that shit I said
to you last night?

19:25.914 --> 19:28.208
About what a kick-ass job I did?

19:28.208 --> 19:30.169
Yeah, you did.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.879
I heard he was as cool as a cucumber.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.922
- He was, man.
- I was.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.633
Except for that part
where you disappeared.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.511
- Scared the shit out of me.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

19:39.636 --> 19:41.263
Scared me too.
I-- I couldn't find her.

19:41.263 --> 19:44.600
But, pretty much it's everything,
everything you did last night.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.852
- The T.O. catch.
- It's that.

19:46.977 --> 19:49.646
- Me pulling you back in.
- Yeah. And all that mess.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.356
Straight goddamn A's
across the board.

19:51.481 --> 19:53.150
But don't start believing
that that means

19:53.275 --> 19:55.569
I'm not gonna continue
to bust your balls around here.

19:55.569 --> 19:58.155
I don't like your political views,
your religious views,

19:58.280 --> 19:59.531
or your general sort of,
you know,

19:59.656 --> 20:01.408
kiss-my-black-ass attitude.

20:01.408 --> 20:04.453
- Right back at you.
- All right, enough.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.622
- Hey.
- <i>Hey.</i>

20:06.622 --> 20:07.831
Whatcha doing?

20:07.956 --> 20:10.000
Taking down the Tommy pictures.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.836
Oh. The shrine?

20:12.836 --> 20:15.923
The shrine. Yeah.
That's funny, by the way.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.050
Oh, yeah, well, does, uh--

20:18.342 --> 20:20.636
Does that mean
that you want me to come over?

20:20.636 --> 20:22.804
Because I'm all fresh.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.766
No. No. Definitely not.

20:25.766 --> 20:30.062
Well, then, why are you taking
down the pictures?

20:30.187 --> 20:31.188
Because he sucks.

20:31.313 --> 20:34.441
- Did you see the paper this morning?
- No.

20:34.441 --> 20:38.195
Seven kids died in a fire that Tommy
and his crew were at last night.

20:38.195 --> 20:41.073
Seven.
Not one kid made it out alive.

20:41.073 --> 20:44.034
And here I am thinking
he's a hero. Asshole.

20:44.159 --> 20:45.202
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.536
- Listen--
- You know what?

20:46.536 --> 20:48.580
Just don't call me any more.

20:51.124 --> 20:53.502
Come on. Come on.
That's it. That's it.

20:53.502 --> 20:54.586
That's it.

20:58.632 --> 20:59.925
Yeah. Whoo!

21:00.175 --> 21:02.344
Come on, Franco, that's it. Let's go.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.639
Yes!

21:09.726 --> 21:10.727
Come on over here.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.108
Come on, move it.
Come on, yeah.

21:19.569 --> 21:20.737
Yes. Yes.

21:20.862 --> 21:22.155
Yes.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.869
Hey, you. Mike. Eyes front.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.123
Come on, put it up there.
Put it up there.

21:31.248 --> 21:32.541
Yeah.

21:37.045 --> 21:38.046
Yeah.

21:38.046 --> 21:39.798
Yes.

21:40.841 --> 21:41.925
Time out.

21:41.925 --> 21:43.010
Come on.

21:46.221 --> 21:48.307
All right, bring it around,
boys, bring it around.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.975
Jesus, kid,
you're a goddamn gold mine.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.184
- Yeah.
- Way to go.

21:51.184 --> 21:52.436
- Amazing, man.
- Keep it up.

21:52.561 --> 21:55.522
All right, you guys get some
drinks and stuff, okay?

21:55.772 --> 21:57.524
Told you to guard their man.
What are you doing?

21:57.774 --> 21:59.735
You guys aren't doing anything
right, I mean...

21:59.735 --> 22:01.570
Maybe we should, uh...

22:01.570 --> 22:02.779
Maybe we should have a, uh--

22:02.779 --> 22:04.448
Huddle.

22:04.573 --> 22:05.574
- Yeah, a huddle.
- A huddle.

22:05.782 --> 22:08.744
- Definitely we need a huddle.
- We need that.

22:08.744 --> 22:09.828
Our uniforms are great.

22:09.953 --> 22:11.413
They're awesome.
They're awesome.

22:11.413 --> 22:13.999
- Good.
- Okay, guys, let's huddle up.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.334
All right, uh--

22:16.877 --> 22:18.795
Uh, I got nothing to say
because you guys are playing

22:18.920 --> 22:20.380
like the goddamn
Celtics out there.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.882
It's just amazing.

22:21.882 --> 22:24.384
I mean-- The Larry Bird 1980s
championship Celtics, okay?

22:24.384 --> 22:26.803
I mean, I got no notes, you know?

22:27.512 --> 22:30.974
So, what I think we should do,
just to make things look better

22:31.099 --> 22:35.312
is I'm gonna draw a giant vagina on this
little board here.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.856
While I'm doing that, you guys
make it look like I'm drawing,

22:37.981 --> 22:39.608
like, some strategy thing, okay?

22:39.816 --> 22:42.569
Instead of the giant kind of
vagina that I'm drawing.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.404
Yeah, which really is the
point of all this.

22:44.404 --> 22:46.490
I mean, the reason why,
you know, you play sports

22:46.490 --> 22:48.575
is to-- Is to meet girls.
So, what I want you to do

22:48.825 --> 22:50.494
is look at this giant
black-and-white vagina

22:50.619 --> 22:52.412
that I'm drawing here.
But I want you to go out

22:52.412 --> 22:54.998
and I want score another 55 points
and we can all get laid

22:54.998 --> 22:56.541
and we can all make
more money, okay?

22:56.666 --> 22:58.960
So on 3, vagina.
One, two, three.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.170
Vagina!

23:00.170 --> 23:01.838
Yes. Let's go.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.428
- Excuse me, guys.
- Sure.

23:08.428 --> 23:09.513
Hey.

23:10.847 --> 23:12.182
Great game.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.600
Yeah. Yeah.
The new kid's a charm.

23:13.850 --> 23:16.061
So did you see me up there?
You know...

23:16.186 --> 23:17.229
Yes.

23:17.354 --> 23:21.316
Yeah, yeah, I did and, um, I can't.
I can't do this any more.

23:21.316 --> 23:23.402
Yeah, I know, me neither.
It's so drafty up there.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.195
No, not that. I mean that,
you know, I can--

23:25.320 --> 23:27.531
I can do all day
or most of the day, actually.

23:27.531 --> 23:30.659
At some point I'd probably
have to climb up and take a closer look.

23:30.867 --> 23:35.455
Um, I'm talking about us.
You know, I-- I, um,

23:35.455 --> 23:38.500
I just think that we're,
you know, done.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.626
Uh, unless--

23:39.626 --> 23:41.878
Listen, I'm sorry,
you know, about what happened.

23:42.045 --> 23:43.880
But I can't really apologize
more than that.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.173
I made a mistake.

23:45.173 --> 23:46.925
You know, now I'm ready
to move forward.

23:47.050 --> 23:48.051
Quickly.

23:48.176 --> 23:49.636
You know, very forward, very fast.

23:49.886 --> 23:51.930
Yeah, look, Theresa, okay?

23:52.055 --> 23:55.976
It's just that, you know,
I've come to this realization

23:55.976 --> 23:57.644
after four and half decades

23:57.894 --> 24:01.440
on this godforsaken,
chocolate-filled planet

24:01.565 --> 24:04.568
that, you know, I want a kid.

24:04.693 --> 24:07.946
You know? Kids.

24:08.071 --> 24:09.656
A couple, maybe.

24:09.656 --> 24:11.283
Oh.

24:11.533 --> 24:16.621
Now, was that kind of a, "Oh,
me too, I want kids"

24:16.746 --> 24:18.039
kind of an "Oh"?

24:18.665 --> 24:22.335
No. No. I taught kids for 10 years.

24:22.335 --> 24:25.297
Ten long, loud, B.O.-filled years.

24:25.422 --> 24:28.341
And I just-- I don't really like kids.
I hate kids.

24:28.341 --> 24:34.014
They're just giant germ factories, really.

24:34.014 --> 24:36.099
Oh.

24:38.393 --> 24:41.480
That was sort of
a death knell type of "Oh"--

24:41.605 --> 24:42.731
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

24:42.939 --> 24:44.858
Yeah, that's what that was.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.401
That was-- Yeah.

24:46.401 --> 24:50.113
- Alrighty, then.
- Okay, so, uh, I'll see you.

24:50.113 --> 24:51.698
Yeah. Great.

24:53.450 --> 24:56.286
Oh, wait, you know what,
there's just one more thing.

24:56.286 --> 24:58.455
I'm gonna need to get
my handcuffs, and my whip,

24:58.455 --> 24:59.915
and my leather lingerie back.

24:59.915 --> 25:03.502
Also the box of edible panties
would be great.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.170
I, um...

25:05.754 --> 25:07.464
I ate all the edible panties.

25:07.589 --> 25:11.092
You ate the panties.

25:14.137 --> 25:15.597
Chocolate flavored?

25:16.306 --> 25:19.100
Yeah, and, um,
vanilla and strawberry.

25:19.643 --> 25:22.479
We had a, you know,
Neapolitan thing going.

25:22.479 --> 25:25.482
- Amen.
- Yeah.

25:25.482 --> 25:26.650
Ah.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.693
Daddy.

25:28.944 --> 25:32.155
Oh, my God, look at you.
You're so big.

25:32.155 --> 25:33.990
- I grew.
- You sure did.

25:33.990 --> 25:35.992
I mean, my gosh, you--
You're all grown up.

25:36.117 --> 25:37.536
Are you married?
You got kids or what?

25:37.786 --> 25:40.080
Mommy says I shouldn't get
married until I'm 30.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.832
She says I have to figure out
my own life and my own power

25:42.958 --> 25:45.335
before I can be
with somebody else.

25:45.335 --> 25:47.921
Your own power, huh?
Well, Mommy's very smart.

25:47.921 --> 25:51.341
Honey, why don't you change
into your, uh,

25:51.341 --> 25:52.842
other clothes,
your play clothes,

25:52.842 --> 25:54.803
and Daddy's gonna take you
for some ice cream.

25:54.803 --> 25:56.179
- Okay.
- And ask Donald

25:56.179 --> 25:58.056
where the puppy's leash is
and then you can

25:58.181 --> 26:00.267
- her with you too, okay?
- Don't leave without me.

26:00.267 --> 26:03.395
No, I'm not gonna do that, baby.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.063
- My God, she's grown a foot.
- I know!

26:05.188 --> 26:07.649
I know, well, not quite,
but give her another few weeks.

26:07.649 --> 26:09.985
You should see how much
she eats, it's staggering.

26:09.985 --> 26:11.903
Yeah.

26:12.028 --> 26:15.657
- Well, you're looking good.
- So do you. You look good too.

26:15.657 --> 26:18.201
- Thanks.
- So you're-- You're back.

26:18.201 --> 26:19.995
Yep.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.538
Well, how long
do you plan on staying?

26:21.663 --> 26:24.541
Uh, permanently, possibly.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.168
- I thought you liked Europe.
- I love Europe.

26:27.168 --> 26:30.714
And, I mean, it was even more wonderful
seeing it through her eyes.

26:30.964 --> 26:33.592
She's so smart and joyful

26:33.717 --> 26:36.094
and, uh, curious.
Yeah, we had a blast.

26:36.094 --> 26:39.389
I made some, uh,
scrapbooks with her

26:39.514 --> 26:41.933
of all the different cities
we've been in.

26:42.058 --> 26:44.227
Mm-hm.

26:44.352 --> 26:47.355
- This one is, uh, from Venice.
- Venice?

26:47.355 --> 26:50.567
I think that was one
of our favorite places.

26:50.567 --> 26:51.985
Uh, yep, see.

26:51.985 --> 26:54.237
- Wow.
- Here we are, you know?

26:54.362 --> 26:56.406
- Cool, huh?
- Yeah.

26:56.406 --> 27:00.785
I still feel so bad.
Her cheating on you...

27:01.578 --> 27:02.912
with me.

27:03.079 --> 27:04.581
That bitch.

27:06.249 --> 27:09.711
Well, you know, it's not the first time
she cheated on anyone.

27:09.919 --> 27:12.255
So she's done it before?

27:12.380 --> 27:14.799
She was a nun when I met her,
so technically, you know,

27:14.924 --> 27:16.885
she was married to Jesus.

27:16.885 --> 27:19.846
I guess that makes you
the other man, huh?

27:19.846 --> 27:21.848
That's a mighty impressive
takeaway on your part.

27:21.848 --> 27:24.434
Yeah, well, real proud about that,

27:24.559 --> 27:27.562
even if it means I'm taking
the express train to hell.

27:27.562 --> 27:29.522
Well, look, it was worth it, right?

27:31.399 --> 27:33.943
No, not really.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.281
But you know...

27:39.908 --> 27:41.409
I mean, you're family, Mike.

27:41.409 --> 27:44.079
That's what's important.
Family, you know.

27:44.079 --> 27:47.540
That-- That unbreakable bond.

27:49.292 --> 27:52.212
And I'm willing to forgive and forget.

27:54.297 --> 27:56.007
Bros before hoes, right?

27:56.132 --> 27:57.926
Bros before hoes.

27:57.926 --> 28:01.554
Great. Now let's get shitfaced
and make it official.

28:03.973 --> 28:06.810
One night we couldn't
sleep and, um, so we got up

28:06.935 --> 28:09.479
and we started wandering
around all the canals

28:09.479 --> 28:13.233
and all the little, kind of,
twisty back alleys

28:13.233 --> 28:15.318
and, gosh, it was so quiet.

28:15.318 --> 28:17.696
It was magical, really, and, uh,

28:17.946 --> 28:20.031
as the sun was coming up
and the fog burned away,

28:20.156 --> 28:21.991
she turned to me and she said,

28:22.117 --> 28:24.160
"You know, we should
bring Daddy here sometime."

28:24.285 --> 28:26.079
Oh.

28:26.079 --> 28:28.415
It really pissed me off.

28:28.415 --> 28:30.667
Yeah.

28:30.917 --> 28:31.960
She wants you in her life.

28:33.461 --> 28:35.171
She needs you.

28:35.171 --> 28:37.048
We need you.

28:38.425 --> 28:41.636
So I was thinking maybe we
should give it another go.

28:43.012 --> 28:45.557
Um, I, um...

28:46.933 --> 28:49.144
Alicia, I-- I-- I kinda--
I met someone.

28:49.352 --> 28:51.563
- A girl.
- You met a girl?

28:51.688 --> 28:53.940
No, you're kidding. Not you.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.942
It's serious.

28:55.942 --> 28:58.528
What does that mean?
Like, a week or something?

28:58.862 --> 28:59.904
I gave her a ring.

29:03.867 --> 29:07.787
- So this is love.
- I guess so.

29:07.787 --> 29:10.874
I mean, yeah, um, totally.
Yeah. It's love.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.667
So when's the big day?

29:12.667 --> 29:14.836
Well, we haven't gotten
that far yet, but--

29:15.044 --> 29:19.007
Well, she knows about
Keela and-- And us?

29:19.007 --> 29:20.967
Yeah. Yeah.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.889
- And you're happy.
- Yeah.

29:28.433 --> 29:31.895
So I guess you won't be moving
in here any time soon.

29:31.895 --> 29:34.397
- Uh, no.
- Just checking. Okay.

29:34.522 --> 29:36.858
Wow. Um...

29:39.986 --> 29:42.864
Well, I'm happy for you.
I'm really happy for you.

29:42.864 --> 29:45.408
- Thank you.
- I guess we'll work something out.

29:45.533 --> 29:47.452
Like, maybe on the--
Every other weekend or--

29:47.577 --> 29:50.079
Except, of course, you've got
a schedule problem sometimes.

29:50.079 --> 29:51.581
But we could think about--

29:51.581 --> 29:55.877
We don't have to figure it out right now.
We've got, uh, time.

29:55.877 --> 29:58.254
- Yeah. We've got time.
- Hey.

29:58.254 --> 29:59.756
Hi. That was fast.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.216
Hi, I'm ready for ice cream.
Let's go.

30:01.216 --> 30:04.761
- Yeah, ice cream. Sounds good.
- Right, all right.

30:04.761 --> 30:06.554
I want Mommy to come.

30:06.763 --> 30:10.433
I want you and Mommy and me
to all be together.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.270
Uh...

30:14.395 --> 30:15.939
I think that maybe this is a time

30:16.064 --> 30:19.317
for you to have a special time
with Daddy all to yourself.

30:19.442 --> 30:20.985
- Yeah. And, um--
- Okay.

30:21.110 --> 30:23.571
I'm gonna stay here and have
some Mommy time all to myself.

30:23.780 --> 30:24.781
All right?

30:24.906 --> 30:26.074
- Okay.
- All right, let's go.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.867
And no ice cream for Penny.

30:27.867 --> 30:29.911
- Okay.
- Okay.

30:29.911 --> 30:31.079
You guys have fun.

30:31.079 --> 30:33.456
- Okay.
- All right, we'll be back soon.

30:33.581 --> 30:34.999
Yeah.

31:17.333 --> 31:20.628
So listen, bro. I got
kind of a confession to make.

31:22.338 --> 31:24.340
- I know why you're gay.
- I'm not gay, dude.

31:24.465 --> 31:27.135
Yes, you are.
Come on. And here's why.

31:27.135 --> 31:28.344
Your parents were gay.

31:28.469 --> 31:30.054
- What?
- Yeah, your parents are gay.

31:30.179 --> 31:32.515
They're homos, Mike. Come on.

31:32.515 --> 31:34.767
- How do you know about that?
- Well, ahem,

31:34.767 --> 31:37.186
that's the other part of the
confession I was getting to.

31:37.186 --> 31:41.024
Remember that big fire at your
mom's house that burned the house down?

31:41.149 --> 31:43.860
I broke in that night
and I rooted around in the closets

31:43.985 --> 31:45.486
and I found all the pictures.

31:45.486 --> 31:46.779
Well, never mind the pictures.

31:46.779 --> 31:49.866
Did you see who burned
my mom's house down?

31:49.866 --> 31:51.534
I'm sorry, dude,
I'm really sorry.

31:51.534 --> 31:53.953
- You can hit me if you want.
- Ow.

31:53.953 --> 31:57.332
Ow! Asshole!
You said I could hit you.

31:57.332 --> 31:58.958
I'm sorry.
It was a reflex. I--

31:58.958 --> 32:01.544
Jesus, I feel terrible
about your mom's house, I do.

32:01.544 --> 32:05.048
It was an accident, Mike.
I swear to God.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.966
So that's why the guys are
calling you Zippo.

32:06.966 --> 32:09.218
Yeah. Yeah.

32:09.218 --> 32:11.888
How pissed are you?

32:11.888 --> 32:15.558
I don't know.
You mean about the slap?

32:15.558 --> 32:17.769
No, about the fire, asshole.

32:17.894 --> 32:22.523
I'm not really that
pissed, I guess, you know.

32:22.523 --> 32:27.236
I mean, to be honest, I was--
That place was kind of like--

32:27.362 --> 32:29.989
It had a lot of bad memories,
you know?

32:29.989 --> 32:32.951
And I'm kind of
happy to be rid of it, I guess.

32:33.076 --> 32:34.243
Wow.

32:34.369 --> 32:35.912
- Yeah.
- Okay.

32:35.912 --> 32:37.246
- But you know what?
- Yeah?

32:37.246 --> 32:39.332
You're wrong about a few things.

32:39.332 --> 32:43.252
I'm not gay, and having gay
parents doesn't make you gay.

32:43.252 --> 32:45.505
Right, okay. Well, it's gotta
increase the chances

32:45.505 --> 32:46.965
a little bit, don't you think?

32:47.090 --> 32:50.593
I don't know. Maybe.

32:50.593 --> 32:53.054
Bro, can-- Can you just do me a favor?

32:53.054 --> 32:54.931
Of course, dude. Anything. You name it.

32:55.056 --> 32:56.474
- Promise?
- I promise.

32:56.599 --> 33:00.269
Can you not tell the guys
about my parents?

33:00.395 --> 33:03.398
Okay. Okay.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.191
Yeah, I wouldn't.
I would never.

33:05.191 --> 33:07.944
- Thanks.
- That's, yeah...

33:08.069 --> 33:10.613
I mean, I-- I kind of already did.

33:10.613 --> 33:12.115
You dick!

33:12.115 --> 33:13.574
- Ow!
- Sorry, I was--

33:13.574 --> 33:15.118
- What are you doing?
- I was anticipating.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.452
I didn't-- I can't believe I--

33:16.577 --> 33:18.079
- You all right?
- Don't touch me, asshole.

33:18.079 --> 33:19.664
Come on, hey.

33:51.612 --> 33:53.406
Shit.

33:56.576 --> 33:59.162
- Yeah?
- Hey, Dad.

33:59.162 --> 34:02.498
- Hey, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

34:02.665 --> 34:04.876
Need some money?

34:05.001 --> 34:06.294
I can't believe
that you would think

34:06.294 --> 34:08.963
- that I would be calling you--
- Okay, you know what, sweetheart?

34:08.963 --> 34:11.257
I raised you from
when you were a zygote, okay?

34:11.424 --> 34:14.844
You got my DNA, all right?
I can read you like a book.

34:15.178 --> 34:16.679
I know you're calling me
about money

34:16.679 --> 34:19.182
and I know you're not
calling me about, like, little money.

34:19.182 --> 34:20.600
It must be
the rent money, right?

34:20.600 --> 34:22.810
Nobody calls about a goddamn
blender at this time of night.

34:22.810 --> 34:24.145
Yes.

34:24.145 --> 34:27.315
Um, is your, uh,
ring-nosed loser boyfriend,

34:27.648 --> 34:29.776
kind of sitting there
talking you through this call?

34:30.026 --> 34:31.986
- No.
- Uh-huh. All right.

34:31.986 --> 34:33.196
What's he saying?

34:33.196 --> 34:34.822
Tell you what,
I'll drop the money by,

34:35.031 --> 34:37.033
uh, later tonight, all right?

34:38.367 --> 34:42.038
And tell your boyfriend he can stop.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.289
Stop.

34:43.289 --> 34:44.457
Thanks, Dad.

34:44.457 --> 34:47.919
- Okay, I love you.
- Me too.

34:48.044 --> 34:51.089
Yeah. Do you really love me
or is it just about the money?

34:51.214 --> 34:52.215
What?

34:58.262 --> 35:01.390
<i>The letter tells all about you.</i>

35:01.516 --> 35:03.851
<i>So you'd be foolish
to fire that gun.</i>

35:09.357 --> 35:12.026
<i>Isn't she wonderful?</i>

35:12.026 --> 35:14.112
<i>Isn't she extravagant?</i>

35:18.741 --> 35:19.742
What?

35:20.701 --> 35:22.870
How are you doing?

35:23.287 --> 35:25.414
I'm having a personal trauma.

35:25.414 --> 35:27.500
What?

35:27.500 --> 35:32.171
- Me and Troy broke up for good.
- Troy?

35:32.171 --> 35:34.757
- My valley.
- Oh.

35:34.757 --> 35:36.384
Because of the fire.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.427
The fire?

35:38.427 --> 35:40.096
The baby fire.

35:40.096 --> 35:42.765
Jesus Christ, they're
calling it the baby fire?

35:42.890 --> 35:47.103
Yeah, he even took down
the Tommy Gavin shrine, so--

35:47.103 --> 35:48.980
Oh. Wait a minute.
Oh, that guy.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.899
Yeah, I think that
he was sleeping with me

35:52.316 --> 35:53.776
to hang out with you.

35:53.901 --> 35:56.070
And then he said you're
not even a hero any more

35:56.070 --> 35:59.866
because you let seven babies
die in the fire and then I just...

35:59.866 --> 36:02.618
Okay, you-- It was a goddamn
inferno, Sheila.

36:02.618 --> 36:04.412
- I know.
<i>- It was unbelievable.</i>

36:04.412 --> 36:06.956
I know.
I'm just telling you what he said.

36:10.626 --> 36:11.711
Are you there?

36:11.711 --> 36:14.755
Yeah, I'm here.
I mean, I'm telling you,

36:14.755 --> 36:17.049
they were dropping kids
out the windows

36:17.049 --> 36:18.885
- as we pulled up.
<i>- I know.</i>

36:19.135 --> 36:20.511
<i>- You know?</i>
- I know. I read about it.

36:20.511 --> 36:22.889
Are you okay?

36:23.598 --> 36:25.016
No.

36:29.812 --> 36:31.105
Let me ask you something.

36:33.274 --> 36:36.777
That, uh, plan
that you offered up

36:37.278 --> 36:40.156
about, you know, my kid.

36:41.574 --> 36:42.575
Yeah?

36:43.868 --> 36:45.912
That, uh, still stand?

36:47.205 --> 36:49.415
Yes.

36:49.582 --> 36:51.459
By all means, yes.

36:54.003 --> 36:55.379
<i>- Tommy?</i>
- What?

36:55.379 --> 36:59.425
Are we gonna--
Are we gonna do this?

37:02.345 --> 37:05.973
Nah. No. No, I can't do it.
I'll talk to you later.

37:05.973 --> 37:07.183
Shit.

37:23.491 --> 37:24.992
Come on, pal.

37:24.992 --> 37:27.161
Come on. Oh, yeah. All right.

37:29.872 --> 37:31.123
We all set?

37:31.874 --> 37:33.876
Here we go.

37:38.047 --> 37:39.966
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, it's Mick.</i>

37:39.966 --> 37:41.175
Hey, what's going on?

37:41.175 --> 37:42.343
<i>I got a call from Maggie.</i>

37:42.343 --> 37:45.471
I got a feeling her drinking's
completely out of control.

37:45.471 --> 37:48.516
- She said she's in Montreal.
- Canada?

37:48.641 --> 37:50.893
Yeah. She thought
she was in Paris at first.

37:51.018 --> 37:53.854
Then I get a call from Uncle Teddy's
wife saying he needs help.

37:53.854 --> 37:56.899
Listen, I got an idea how to help them,
but I want to run it by you.

37:56.899 --> 37:58.651
Maybe I drop by in the next
couple of days.

37:58.651 --> 37:59.777
<i>Yeah.</i>

37:59.902 --> 38:03.531
So, um, how you been doing, drinkingwise?

38:03.531 --> 38:04.699
You making any meetings?

38:04.699 --> 38:06.033
No, I've been busy
with the baby

38:06.033 --> 38:07.868
and I'm mostly going off
the little black book.

38:07.868 --> 38:09.078
The 24-hours-a-day book.

38:09.078 --> 38:11.789
Yeah, well, the black book
only goes so far.

38:11.914 --> 38:13.916
Well, it's working for me, pal.

38:14.041 --> 38:15.668
<i>Well, you're sure
you're good, huh?</i>

38:15.668 --> 38:19.588
So you saw the, uh--
The baby fire in the news.

38:19.714 --> 38:22.675
Jesus Christ.
The baby fire. You know what--

38:22.675 --> 38:24.760
They're still calling it
the baby fire, I guess.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.304
Why don't they call it the,
you know,

38:26.429 --> 38:28.431
16-appliances- plugged-into-
one-wall-socket fire?

38:28.431 --> 38:29.974
How about that, huh?

38:30.099 --> 38:32.268
Yeah, I know, Tom. I'm just
saying what they're saying.

38:32.268 --> 38:34.520
Or how about the
God-doesn't-really-give-a-shit

38:34.520 --> 38:36.897
about-poor-black-kids fire?
How about that name?

38:36.897 --> 38:38.899
- Tom.
- It's unbelievable to me, man.

38:38.899 --> 38:40.693
It really is. What was God
thinking here, Mick?

38:40.693 --> 38:42.778
What did he have in mind?

38:42.778 --> 38:46.073
We don't know, you know?
Maybe he was showing his mercy.

38:46.198 --> 38:47.950
Maybe he was saving these kids

38:47.950 --> 38:50.703
from a fate far worse
down the line somewhere.

38:50.703 --> 38:52.038
<i>Either way,
it's out of our hands.</i>

38:52.163 --> 38:53.622
Let me tell
you something, okay?

38:53.622 --> 38:56.083
We carried those goddamn kids
out in our goddamn hands, okay?

38:56.292 --> 38:58.794
Because their moron parents
plugged in faulty space heaters

38:58.919 --> 39:00.421
because they were trying
to keep warm

39:00.421 --> 39:02.506
because their shit-ass
landlords were too cheap

39:02.506 --> 39:03.841
to keep the goddamn heat on.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.259
God had nothing to do with it.

39:05.259 --> 39:07.261
God doesn't even enter
into the equation, okay?

39:07.386 --> 39:10.348
According to your theory,
I guess God had Connor run over

39:10.473 --> 39:11.640
by a drunk driver. Why?

39:11.766 --> 39:13.934
To spare him the fate of maybe
having cancer of the ass

39:13.934 --> 39:16.520
when he was 42 years old? Is
that what's going on Mick? Huh?

39:16.645 --> 39:19.482
Or maybe because of his DNA
he becomes a raging alcoholic,

39:19.482 --> 39:21.275
gets behind the wheel
with a load on

39:21.275 --> 39:24.403
and runs over somebody else's
innocent kid 15 years from now.

39:24.403 --> 39:27.823
Maybe that's what's happening.
Did you ever think of that?

39:27.823 --> 39:29.658
Huh? Tom?

39:29.658 --> 39:30.785
Yeah.

39:30.785 --> 39:32.536
Tommy.

39:33.162 --> 39:35.581
Nobody knows nothing, Mick.

39:35.581 --> 39:37.166
Not until it happens.

39:37.625 --> 39:39.001
You're wrong.

39:39.001 --> 39:40.920
Everything happens for a reason.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.338
Yeah?

39:42.338 --> 39:44.548
<i>Yeah.</i>

39:46.008 --> 39:47.843
All right.

40:35.182 --> 40:37.810
You got no choice here, Tommy.

40:37.810 --> 40:41.230
Janet, she don't want him.

40:41.730 --> 40:42.982
You give him to Sheila,

40:43.232 --> 40:45.526
and Janet's just gonna
take him back out of spite,

40:45.526 --> 40:46.735
and then what do you got?

40:46.861 --> 40:52.992
You got a mother raising a kid
day by day, little by little,

40:52.992 --> 40:56.495
inch by inch filling that
kid up with a lack of love.

40:57.246 --> 41:00.166
Adoption? No way.

41:00.166 --> 41:02.835
I don't want my kid being
raised by no stranger.

41:03.085 --> 41:04.420
You know what I'm saying?

41:04.420 --> 41:07.214
And me, I'm not gonna be around.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.592
And you sure as shit
ain't gonna be able

41:09.592 --> 41:11.093
to get over your hatred for me

41:11.218 --> 41:17.141
for what I done enough
to be a-- A go-to type of dad, you know?

41:20.019 --> 41:22.480
I'm telling you,
this kid, you and I both know

41:22.605 --> 41:25.065
that he's got a life of misery
coming at him.

41:25.524 --> 41:30.863
Full of lawyers and self-loathing,
absentee dads.

41:41.916 --> 41:43.876
Put him out of his misery, Tommy.

41:45.794 --> 41:47.379
Drop him in the river.

41:48.797 --> 41:50.799
It's the right thing to do.

41:52.843 --> 41:54.094
Do it.

41:56.555 --> 41:57.598
Do it for me.

42:08.943 --> 42:13.072
<i>If my man was fighting</i>

42:13.072 --> 42:16.408
<i>Some unholy war</i>

42:16.534 --> 42:19.203
<i>I would be behind him</i>

42:19.203 --> 42:23.958
<i>Straight shook up
Beside him</i>

42:23.958 --> 42:27.336
<i>With strength
He didn't know</i>

42:27.336 --> 42:31.257
<i>It's you I'm fighting for</i>

42:31.382 --> 42:36.178
<i>He can't lose
With me in tow</i>

42:36.303 --> 42:41.600
<i>I refuse to let him go</i>

42:41.600 --> 42:46.939
<i>At his side
And drunk on pride</i>

42:47.147 --> 42:51.318
<i>We wait for the blow</i>

42:53.988 --> 42:56.532
<i>We put it in writing</i>

42:56.657 --> 42:59.660
<i>But who you writing for?</i>

42:59.868 --> 43:02.830
<i>Just us on kitchen floor</i>

43:02.830 --> 43:07.876
<i>Justice done, reciting</i>

43:07.876 --> 43:10.671
<i>My stomach standing still</i>

43:10.879 --> 43:14.967
<i>Like you're reading my will</i>

43:14.967 --> 43:19.972
<i>He still stands in spite
Of what his scars say</i>

43:19.972 --> 43:25.352
<i>And I'll battle
Till this bitter finale</i>

43:25.352 --> 43:30.816
<i>Just me, my dignity</i>

43:30.816 --> 43:33.319
<i>And this guitar case</i>

43:33.319 --> 43:36.655
<i>Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh</i>

43:46.665 --> 43:50.669
<i>If my man was fighting</i>

43:50.836 --> 43:54.214
<i>Some unholy war</i>

43:54.214 --> 43:57.468
<i>I would be behind him</i>

43:57.593 --> 44:01.513
<i>Straight shook up
Beside him</i>

44:01.513 --> 44:04.933
<i>With strength
He didn't know</i>

44:04.933 --> 44:08.020
<i>It's you I'm fighting for</i>

44:08.020 --> 44:11.940
<i>If my man was fighting</i>

44:13.942 --> 44:17.905
<i>Some unholy war</i>

44:17.905 --> 44:21.033
<i>If my man was fighting</i>
