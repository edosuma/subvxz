09:24.523 --> 09:27.609
Mom, he left. Let's go now.

09:27.693 --> 09:29.194
We can't.

09:29.278 --> 09:30.320
Why not?

09:30.404 --> 09:32.114
He killed that woman!

09:32.197 --> 09:34.199
What's wrong with you?

09:35.575 --> 09:36.785
If you won't, I will.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.537
That's enough, Toni!

09:38.620 --> 09:39.538
We can't because...

09:39.621 --> 09:40.956
they'll find us.

09:42.624 --> 09:46.295
They'll just send a different
version of me and you.

09:46.378 --> 09:49.756
Just start the car, please.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.349
I lied to you.

10:04.313 --> 10:07.232
I told you
your legacy was a blessing.

10:08.942 --> 10:12.029
I wanted to protect you, Toni.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.365
What do you have to do?

10:29.504 --> 10:32.549
I will find the Apostate.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.593
And take care of it.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.845
Then we'll be done.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.766
You mean kill him?

11:33.110 --> 11:35.070
If I don't,
they'll take you away.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.488
What? Take me where?

11:36.571 --> 11:38.073
Don't worry.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.825
Because that won't happen.

12:15.569 --> 12:16.695
Stay calm.

12:16.778 --> 12:17.988
Everything is going to be fine.

23:13.518 --> 23:14.852
Toni, is everything okay?

24:09.157 --> 24:11.576
No, I remember.

24:11.659 --> 24:13.703
They brought you
to meet my mother.

24:15.538 --> 24:17.665
I was just a little boy.

24:17.748 --> 24:21.919
You kneeled in front of her
during the ceremony.

24:23.212 --> 24:24.338
Afterwards,

24:24.422 --> 24:25.339
you cried.

24:25.423 --> 24:26.883
Better not to speak.

24:28.759 --> 24:31.804
I never really understood
the Guardians.

24:31.888 --> 24:33.639
All that sacrifice.

24:33.723 --> 24:35.391
For what?

24:35.474 --> 24:37.476
To protect something
that they'll

24:37.560 --> 24:39.770
never truly be a part of.

24:39.854 --> 24:41.981
You turned your back
on your family,

24:42.064 --> 24:42.982
your community

24:43.065 --> 24:44.275
and your faith.

24:45.568 --> 24:47.403
I know what you've done.

24:50.281 --> 24:51.699
I had no choice.

24:54.285 --> 24:55.870
Neither do I now.

26:52.028 --> 26:53.112
Please, don't do this.

26:53.195 --> 26:55.281
Quiet, darling. Look away.

27:06.584 --> 27:08.336
Complete...

27:08.419 --> 27:10.004
the mission.

28:18.239 --> 28:19.865
Are you okay?

29:04.660 --> 29:06.662
Mom, what is going to happen
to the house?

29:07.746 --> 29:10.458
Can we ever go back
to get our stuff?

29:11.876 --> 29:14.044
Honestly, I don't think so.

29:14.128 --> 29:16.881
Whatever we left behind, Toni,

29:17.882 --> 29:19.091
can be replaced.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.553
Mama, what is Caerul?

29:22.636 --> 29:24.889
Don't worry about that.

29:27.558 --> 29:29.518
We're gonna be okay.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.605
I promise.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.944
You said they would
keep looking for us.

29:39.028 --> 29:40.613
But they'll stop.

29:40.696 --> 29:42.448
Why?

29:42.531 --> 29:45.534
Because we have
a bargaining chip now.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.732
So, what are we going to do?

35:50.816 --> 35:51.817
I don't know.

35:54.903 --> 35:56.280
Can we go to Disneyland?

35:57.281 --> 35:58.323
Yes,

35:58.407 --> 35:59.491
we can.

36:03.078 --> 36:04.788
Hold on!

36:07.457 --> 36:08.375
What's happening?

36:08.458 --> 36:09.459
I don't know!

36:53.879 --> 36:55.672
What happened?

37:26.495 --> 37:27.704
Mom!
