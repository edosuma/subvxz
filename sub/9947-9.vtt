00:01.800 --> 00:05.799
Anyone watching, thinking we know
fuck all about knowing fuck all

00:05.800 --> 00:08.559
about owt, needs
to watch their back...

00:08.560 --> 00:10.959
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:10.960 --> 00:14.079
sending prices sky-high - literally.

00:14.080 --> 00:17.999
Literally, taking the grass
from its own roots!

00:18.000 --> 00:20.159
And now you've got your
Con-Dem-nation...

00:20.160 --> 00:23.559
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up!

00:23.560 --> 00:27.399
Have we had
a national fucking stroke or what?

00:27.400 --> 00:30.319
Is revolution a word...

00:30.320 --> 00:31.599
or was it never?

00:31.600 --> 00:35.439
Anybody watching needs to know,
we cope better than average

00:35.440 --> 00:37.079
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.399
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

00:39.400 --> 00:43.399
and they charge us for water?!

00:44.280 --> 00:48.119
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:48.120 --> 00:51.839
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times...

00:51.840 --> 00:54.439
Yak-yak-yak,
yak-yak-yak, yak-yak-yak!

00:54.440 --> 00:57.719
It's not theirs anymore.

00:57.720 --> 01:01.399
This is our England now.

01:01.400 --> 01:05.399
Party!

01:14.120 --> 01:18.119
I'm sorry.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.359
They say that it only takes
two generations for people

01:29.360 --> 01:31.359
to forget your name.

01:31.360 --> 01:35.279
I thought this was bullshit until I
realised I didn't know my grandmother's,

01:35.280 --> 01:38.799
never mind my great grandmother's.
Or my granddad's.

01:38.800 --> 01:42.799
Two generations, and gone.

01:52.920 --> 01:56.159
We're told you live on through
your kids, but I ain't got any,

01:56.160 --> 01:58.039
so that's that theory fucked.

01:58.040 --> 01:59.079
Get your tits out.

01:59.080 --> 02:02.519
'You can live on through your deeds
and that's great,

02:02.520 --> 02:05.039
'so long as you're discovering
penicillin.' Fuck.

02:05.040 --> 02:08.519
'Who's going to remember me giving
a punter his best orgasm yet?

02:08.520 --> 02:12.519
'Besides the punter, obviously.'

02:18.800 --> 02:21.719
So for me and you,
the ordinary folk, the cannon fodder,

02:21.720 --> 02:25.719
once we've popped our clogs,
that's it.

02:30.080 --> 02:33.599
So the best idea would be
to spread a little happiness

02:33.600 --> 02:35.959
while we're still
in the here and now.

02:35.960 --> 02:39.959
Shine a little light
into the dark corner.

02:40.240 --> 02:44.239
Make a difference.

02:45.520 --> 02:49.519
Absolutely gone with the wind.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.239
What else was it, Frank?

02:56.240 --> 02:59.559
Sorry, Mimi, voddy - double...

02:59.560 --> 03:03.399
Oh.

03:03.400 --> 03:07.399
..crisps...nuts.

03:11.880 --> 03:15.439
Ta. And change?

03:15.440 --> 03:19.439
I gave you 20.

03:24.480 --> 03:28.799
Two pints, two double vodkas, crisps,
nuts. 9.60, please.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.199
No charge for taking the piss
out of my mum.

03:31.200 --> 03:35.199
But if you do it again, I'll take
it out on your fucking face.

03:36.760 --> 03:39.599
Mam, what's going on with you?
Frank Gallagher with a 20?

03:39.600 --> 03:40.839
Ches taking the piss?

03:40.840 --> 03:44.839
I don't know
if I'm coming or fucking going.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.959
Mimi, d'you want to get off
and have a kip - you look knackered.

03:51.960 --> 03:55.959
Keep hold of her a minute,
I've just got to run to the bog.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.159
And Aunty Anna was only 42.

04:00.160 --> 04:03.239
They said two years,
she barely lasted six months.

04:03.240 --> 04:07.239
Oh, yeah, I knew a bloke got three
years. He was on remand that long,

04:07.360 --> 04:10.519
he was out before he was in.
Cat burglar name of Pussy Willow.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.839
I'm not getting maudlin.
I've got things to do.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.879
Plans to make. Less work, more play

04:14.880 --> 04:18.199
and I'm going to try like fuck to put
a smile on your mother's face.

04:18.200 --> 04:21.519
We'll have that place like a palace
by the time we've finished.

04:21.519 --> 04:23.039
Little oasis for her.

04:23.040 --> 04:27.039
Diddy Noel and lickle Liam of her
very own, like a welcome home party.

04:28.360 --> 04:32.359
It's invitation only, Frank. Shane
wants me to do a bit of stripping.

04:34.560 --> 04:38.559
Come if you can handle it.
But...it might get dirty.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.879
Settled in OK?

04:44.880 --> 04:46.079
Loving it.

04:46.080 --> 04:50.079
All Bonnie's work.

04:50.560 --> 04:54.559
This is fantastic.
So much done in so little time...

04:57.680 --> 04:58.959
She's a logistical genius.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.439
Easy for you to say.

05:00.440 --> 05:01.799
Believe me, it isn't.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.239
I've been on at you for years to get
this place done up.

05:04.240 --> 05:07.359
Never listened.
Knew Bonnie would work her magic.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.559
They used to call me
the anal girl at school.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.839
Early starter?

05:10.840 --> 05:12.359
On account of my organising skills.

05:12.360 --> 05:16.039
120 a go, they were.
Nearly give me a thrombo.

05:16.040 --> 05:19.239
Get out your box,
Lillian, dream big.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.519
Broaden your horizons.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.159
Plus, you'll make that back in
no time with the money

05:23.160 --> 05:25.799
you don't need to spend on
replacing the curtains.

05:25.800 --> 05:29.439
Dirty bastards -
been wiping their cocks on them.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.519
We're doing a bit
of decorating for Mimi.

05:31.520 --> 05:34.319
D'you fancy popping round,
give us a bit of advice?

05:34.320 --> 05:38.319
I'd love to.

05:42.360 --> 05:45.199
Typical Micky, a bit of work
to be done and he fucks off.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.559
Where's he gone?

05:46.560 --> 05:50.199
Team building exercise,
y'know for a few days with college.

05:50.200 --> 05:54.199
♪ WHAM: Club Tropicana

05:58.040 --> 05:59.199
Sooner him than me.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.079
So, anyway, Kel.

06:02.080 --> 06:05.239
She's been having a tough time,
so she came up with the idea

06:05.240 --> 06:06.679
of decorating this place for Mam.

06:06.680 --> 06:08.079
Don't sound too keen.

06:08.080 --> 06:12.079
Chesney, the last thing I want to be
doing in my spare time is decorating.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.559
Might be different if it
were our own place.

06:14.560 --> 06:15.759
You do live here.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.959
It's not like
we had much choice.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.599
Couldn't afford a place,
council told us to fuck off.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.079
You've got it made, Mimi's got tea
on the table every night,

06:24.080 --> 06:25.319
ironing done...

06:25.320 --> 06:27.799
Yes, but the price that
you pay for that

06:27.800 --> 06:29.999
is complete lack of privacy.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.999
It's not like you, doing what you
like, to who you like, when you like.

06:34.200 --> 06:37.999
Have I missed the stripping?

06:38.000 --> 06:41.999
Oh, ha-fucking-ha.

06:59.480 --> 07:00.519
Where's Mum?

07:00.520 --> 07:03.159
Don't you ever knock?

07:03.160 --> 07:04.359
Out with the girls.

07:04.360 --> 07:05.159
Girls?

07:05.160 --> 07:06.199
Girls?
From work.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.479
There aren't any girls
at Mum's work,

07:08.480 --> 07:09.999
there's no-one under the age of 60.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.359
And where are you off?

07:12.360 --> 07:14.399
Parents' evening.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.439
In fancy dress?

07:15.440 --> 07:17.599
Meeting up with your mum
later for a drink.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.239
On a Wednesday?

07:19.240 --> 07:20.839
Since when have you started
to go out on Wednesdays?

07:20.840 --> 07:22.119
Will you piss off!

07:22.120 --> 07:23.919
What's with the third degree?

07:23.920 --> 07:27.199
It's usually a Friday or a Saturday.

07:27.200 --> 07:31.039
And what about my tea?

07:31.040 --> 07:35.039
Downstairs cupboard, open, big
green tin with "beans" on the front.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.519
He said he was going to
a parents' evening,

07:43.520 --> 07:46.159
but I know that there isn't
a parents' evening.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.919
He was dressed like
he was on Pimp My Ride

07:47.920 --> 07:50.679
and stunk like an air freshener.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.279
What's he up to?

07:52.280 --> 07:53.239
He's playing away.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.719
I'm telling Mum.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.599
And blow a golden opportunity? No.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.159
Let him know you've rumbled him.

07:58.160 --> 08:01.279
Put the squeeze on, sit back
and watch the rewards roll in.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.839
I can't, it's not right.

08:02.840 --> 08:06.839
And him banging some slapper is?

08:11.440 --> 08:12.519
Ladies.

08:12.520 --> 08:16.519
Typical Gallagher, only turns up
when a job's nearly finished.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.439
Yeah, fuck off, glory boy!

08:19.440 --> 08:21.359
I'll just go home, then...

08:21.360 --> 08:22.799
Hey-hey-hey!

08:22.800 --> 08:25.719
Carlos! Me old mucker!

08:25.720 --> 08:27.999
And it's like a little thank you,
isn't it?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.599
For putting a roof over
your heads and all that.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.639
Exactly.

08:30.640 --> 08:34.639
She's forgotten she kicked the whole thing off
in the first place, accused us of interfering.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.078
Forgotten?

08:40.080 --> 08:41.839
What, like dementia?

08:41.840 --> 08:45.839
Runs in the family. She had a cousin
who thought he were Bono.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.999
Had Nelson Mandela on speed dial.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.039
Fuck've you done!?

08:52.040 --> 08:53.999
Doing the place up.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.999
I don't want it doing up.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.159
See what I mean?

08:58.160 --> 08:59.959
You'll love it, honest.

08:59.960 --> 09:03.959
Look at the new carpet
we've got coming...

09:03.960 --> 09:07.759
Get out.

09:07.760 --> 09:11.199
I said get out!

09:11.200 --> 09:14.479
All right. I think we'd better
call it a night, thanks everyone.

09:14.480 --> 09:18.479
Thanks very much for your help.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.839
Grub up!

09:41.840 --> 09:44.799
Hardly appropriate attire for dinner.

09:44.800 --> 09:48.799
Hardly the appropriate time.

09:51.040 --> 09:55.039
It's four o'clock
in the morning, Mimi.

09:57.960 --> 10:01.239
It's the middle of the night.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.439
Cilla's in our bed.

10:02.440 --> 10:04.039
You must think I'm stupid.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.519
Mimi, what's wrong?

10:05.520 --> 10:09.519
Nothing.

10:10.520 --> 10:11.959
Gotta get this lot tidied.

10:11.960 --> 10:15.079
It'll do for our tea tomorrow.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.239
Leave it, it'll keep.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.279
Get to bed. This needs sorting.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.319
Then let me help...

10:20.320 --> 10:24.319
I said get to bed!

10:49.615 --> 10:51.974
Go on, then. Dig in.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.500
I don't actually think I'm
worthy to sit at your table.

10:55.501 --> 10:57.679
Don't go all biblical on me, son.

10:57.680 --> 11:00.255
I'm just a dead weight.
Human luggage.

11:00.679 --> 11:01.907
I'm neither use nor ornament.

11:01.908 --> 11:05.066
You're my flesh and blood.
You might have the intellectual

11:05.067 --> 11:08.386
capacity of an amoeba,
but you've a heart of gold.

11:08.976 --> 11:11.535
And what mother wouldn't love you?

11:11.536 --> 11:13.935
After all I've done?
The pain I've caused?

11:13.936 --> 11:16.655
You're too like your
dad for your own good.

11:16.656 --> 11:19.055
No-one knows better than Jamie.

11:19.056 --> 11:23.055
That'll be your downfall -
your arrogance. Your vanity.

11:23.296 --> 11:24.495
You're too good to me.

11:24.496 --> 11:28.495
I know. There's even a space in my
heart for you, you mad fucking slut.

11:31.816 --> 11:35.015
Even though I tried to thieve your
home from under your nose?

11:35.016 --> 11:38.335
Thrown back every ounce of love
you've ever shown back in your face?

11:38.336 --> 11:40.215
You have embarrassed the fuck out

11:40.216 --> 11:43.375
of me by not being able
to father a child of your own.

11:43.376 --> 11:47.175
You look like a tramp, you smell
like a night on a wet riverbank

11:47.176 --> 11:50.695
and you're married to a woman who
sells her fanny for less than

11:50.696 --> 11:53.575
the price of a Variety Bucket
of KFC.

11:53.576 --> 11:57.055
But I still love you.
That's just the woman I am.

11:57.056 --> 12:01.055
Now, this chicken
won't carve itself.

12:02.096 --> 12:05.135
Room for a little 'un?

12:05.136 --> 12:09.135
No. No. NO!

12:16.856 --> 12:20.855
Oh, no!

12:21.496 --> 12:24.375
Then I'm going to have
to insist on payment in kind.

12:24.376 --> 12:27.895
Well, if your husband's out,
I'll come round soon as

12:27.896 --> 12:31.895
and sort your pipes out, Mrs Smith.
I'll see you shortly.

12:34.456 --> 12:35.815
You were right.

12:35.816 --> 12:39.615
The old bastard's shagging
some slapper called Mrs Smith.

12:39.616 --> 12:41.535
Just keep your eye on
the big picture.

12:41.536 --> 12:45.055
The big picture's my family
falling apart and it's all his fault.

12:45.056 --> 12:49.215
So start small, say 20,

12:49.216 --> 12:52.615
pile on the pressure over a few
weeks and work up to an iPad.

12:53.536 --> 12:57.535
Make him pay.

13:20.176 --> 13:24.175
Aaargh!

13:44.136 --> 13:48.135
This is the devil's work.

13:48.136 --> 13:50.015
Who are you calling?

13:50.016 --> 13:54.015
Fuckin' Ghostbusters,
who do you think?

13:54.376 --> 13:55.815
Father McKenzie...

13:55.816 --> 13:57.935
the place needs to be exorcised.

13:57.936 --> 14:01.375
Fuck's sake, Mimi!

14:04.136 --> 14:06.855
Dark forces are at work here.

14:09.096 --> 14:10.215
What the fuck?

14:10.216 --> 14:12.935
Get the door, will you?

14:12.936 --> 14:16.855
The house is haunted, possessed.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.415
Hi, lads. Anywhere in there.

14:19.416 --> 14:23.215
What if it was built over
a loony bin? An orphanage?

14:23.216 --> 14:25.255
A Red Indian burial site!?

14:25.256 --> 14:28.895
Mimi! Mimi!

14:28.896 --> 14:30.855
When was the last time you slept?

14:30.856 --> 14:32.135
Tuesday.

14:32.136 --> 14:34.575
You've gone two whole
nights without sleep?

14:34.576 --> 14:37.695
Last Tuesday.

14:37.696 --> 14:41.455
What have you done
to my fucking house?

14:41.456 --> 14:45.335
It's part of the makeover.
We talked about it, remember?

14:45.336 --> 14:48.175
I've got to get to work.
She needs help. Get her some.

14:48.176 --> 14:49.815
Come on, Mam, do us a favour.

14:49.816 --> 14:53.015
Go upstairs, get yourself
changed, take Cilla out for a walk.

14:53.016 --> 14:55.015
Fresh air might do you good.

14:55.016 --> 14:59.015
When you get back everything'll
be back to normal. All right?

15:01.616 --> 15:04.215
I've sewn name tags
into all our work gear.

15:04.216 --> 15:05.255
Good idea.

15:05.256 --> 15:08.615
Stockings, suspenders, strap-ons.
It'll save time and mix-ups.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.415
Oh, and thanks for the other night.
I had a great time.

15:11.416 --> 15:13.095
You made me feel really welcome.

15:13.096 --> 15:15.895
It's nice to see you away from work.

15:15.896 --> 15:19.215
If you need me to cover your shifts,
the place up, give us a shout.

15:19.216 --> 15:20.575
You don't mind baby-sitting Lillian?

15:20.576 --> 15:21.695
I really like her.

15:21.696 --> 15:24.135
Sooner you than me.

15:24.136 --> 15:26.775
Thanks. I might take you up on that.

15:26.776 --> 15:29.015
Are you done yet, Chief Inspector?

15:29.016 --> 15:33.015
No, no, no, no...
Keep going, keep going.

15:35.056 --> 15:38.255
This normally finishes him off.

15:39.576 --> 15:43.575
Oooh! Oh! Ah!

15:59.576 --> 16:03.215
Oh, for fuck's sake!

16:03.216 --> 16:06.135
It's getting that way
I don't want to be there.

16:06.136 --> 16:08.215
Me own house.

16:08.216 --> 16:11.215
My fucking house, not theirs.

16:11.216 --> 16:15.215
Like a stranger.
It's like I'm the lodger!

16:20.696 --> 16:24.695
Yeah, it looks great.
Bit of a disaster with Mam, though...

16:24.816 --> 16:28.255
she's fucked off out and left me
holding the baby again.

16:30.096 --> 16:31.975
Shit, you all right?

16:31.976 --> 16:34.815
That was just a little bit too hot.

16:34.816 --> 16:38.815
Just try and get her to sleep
and crack on, OK?

16:39.336 --> 16:40.375
Laters.

16:40.376 --> 16:41.775
It's looking good, isn't it?

16:41.776 --> 16:45.775
Oh, I like my pelt au naturel.
I did have it shaved once,

16:45.816 --> 16:49.415
but my Brendan said it was like
shagging a welcome mat.

16:49.416 --> 16:50.455
Lillian...dry gag.

16:50.456 --> 16:54.455
You don't want to give your boyfriend a treat?
You're not too old.

16:54.496 --> 16:56.775
I'm too old for boyfriends.

16:56.776 --> 16:59.855
Don't be daft, you're in your prime!

16:59.856 --> 17:01.455
They're too old for me.

17:01.456 --> 17:04.454
I like the element of surprise
a younger man can bring.

17:04.455 --> 17:08.175
Creeping up and being slotted one
when you're least expecting it.

17:08.175 --> 17:10.335
I was once taken bending down
tying my laces.

17:10.336 --> 17:14.255
The best thing about the young 'uns is,
they're ready again in ten minutes.

17:14.256 --> 17:17.535
Now, my Brendan
needed a fortnight's notice.

17:17.536 --> 17:20.095
In writing.

17:29.096 --> 17:30.455
You're home early.

17:30.456 --> 17:31.655
Music teacher's sick.

17:31.656 --> 17:34.935
You might fool Mum,
but you don't fool me.

17:34.936 --> 17:36.215
What?
I know.

17:36.216 --> 17:37.015
Know what?

17:37.016 --> 17:37.975
I know.

17:37.976 --> 17:39.815
What are you talking about?

17:39.816 --> 17:43.815
Your dirty little secret.
I saw you on the phone.

17:45.176 --> 17:47.535
It was a one-off, I was stressed.

17:47.536 --> 17:48.655
20.

17:48.656 --> 17:49.855
What?

17:49.856 --> 17:52.695
Or Mum hears the lot,
and it won't be pretty.

17:54.816 --> 17:56.135
Hiya!

17:56.136 --> 18:00.135
Bit of extra pocket money!

18:02.776 --> 18:05.135
Isn't it a bit extravagant?

18:05.136 --> 18:07.615
The old one's knackered,
so you've been going to

18:07.616 --> 18:11.255
the bag-wash every week.
Three loads, wash and dry? So...

18:11.256 --> 18:14.895
20 a trip, minimum.
What's that over a year?

18:14.896 --> 18:17.855
1,400.

18:17.856 --> 18:19.655
Fuck me!

18:19.656 --> 18:21.375
Profit's going down the plughole.

18:21.376 --> 18:23.775
This is your business -
you need it working

18:23.776 --> 18:26.415
for you, not the other way round.

18:29.096 --> 18:30.135
How's it feeling?

18:30.136 --> 18:32.135
Hot. And not in a good way.

18:32.136 --> 18:35.055
Sorry. My fault.
I'll make it up to you some time.

18:35.056 --> 18:37.655
Your 12 o'clock's in.

18:37.656 --> 18:41.655
Make it up to me now. I really want
to spend more time at home and...

18:42.616 --> 18:46.615
Oh, go on, then.

18:46.696 --> 18:50.375
Mr Etheridge, this is Bonnie.

18:50.376 --> 18:54.375
She's new. And I mean new.

18:57.936 --> 18:59.655
Where's Cilla?

18:59.656 --> 19:01.015
Bed.

19:01.016 --> 19:03.695
How come you're still on this?
It's hardly rocket science!

19:03.696 --> 19:05.535
Because the last leg won't go on.

19:05.536 --> 19:08.055
The special bolt needed
to attach it is missing.

19:08.056 --> 19:09.335
We'll take it back, then.

19:09.336 --> 19:12.775
I phoned, we bought the last one -
they've got no spare parts.

19:12.776 --> 19:13.975
Get a refund.

19:13.976 --> 19:15.895
They don't do refunds.

19:15.896 --> 19:17.855
200 notes for a three-legged table.

19:17.856 --> 19:21.855
Only us, eh?

19:24.016 --> 19:26.055
Hard day at the office, dear?

19:26.056 --> 19:28.455
Hurray for Hollywood.

19:28.456 --> 19:29.775
Ooh, shaven haven!

19:29.776 --> 19:33.775
Punters love it. Crabs hate it.
No hiding place, according to Bonnie. Approve?

19:34.856 --> 19:37.535
I'd sooner have a bit of grass
on the pitch, know what I mean?

19:37.536 --> 19:38.775
Jesus, Shane.

19:38.776 --> 19:42.775
You look like you've been whipped!

19:44.536 --> 19:48.055
I feel as sick as a dog.
Light-headed.

19:48.056 --> 19:50.775
It's definitely got worse.

19:50.776 --> 19:54.775
You need to see a doctor.

19:54.856 --> 19:58.855
We were about to call out
a search party.

20:00.136 --> 20:01.135
She OK?

20:01.136 --> 20:03.215
Tired.

20:03.216 --> 20:07.055
Cunts! You've moved everything!

20:07.056 --> 20:08.095
Didn't you tell her?

20:08.096 --> 20:11.095
Tell her what?
That you're messing with her head,

20:11.096 --> 20:14.455
and telling everyone she's mad
so you can have her carted off

20:14.456 --> 20:17.295
to the fuckin' nuthouse
and out your way for good?

20:17.296 --> 20:21.295
No... That we moved the knives
and forks to a different drawer.

20:31.336 --> 20:32.375
Somebody's having a good time.

20:34.976 --> 20:37.095
Never had a multiple. You?

20:37.096 --> 20:41.095
Just one.
Made me feel sick like the waltzers.

20:41.616 --> 20:44.975
Oh, it's nice
to have a bit of company.

20:44.976 --> 20:47.335
You've got friends,
you're close to Kelly.

20:47.336 --> 20:49.335
Oh, she's always busy these days.

20:49.336 --> 20:51.295
She's got Shane, I suppose.

20:51.296 --> 20:52.855
She's bound to put him first.

20:52.856 --> 20:55.575
But you go the pub and see people.

20:55.576 --> 20:57.255
And then I come home alone.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.735
I don't know what I did with
myself before you moved in.

20:59.736 --> 21:02.655
Feels like a new beginning.
Another chance at happiness.

21:02.656 --> 21:05.695
I'm not a muff-diver, by the way.

21:05.696 --> 21:07.695
Don't be daft, I know.

21:07.696 --> 21:11.295
It's just nice having a bit
of company, isn't it, Mum?

21:11.296 --> 21:15.295
Yeah, yeah. It is.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.775
This your Rodney?

21:17.776 --> 21:18.495
Mmm.

21:18.496 --> 21:19.735
Mmm.
He looks nice.

21:19.736 --> 21:22.415
You're just being polite,
he looks a twat.

21:22.416 --> 21:24.775
And he looks a twat
because he is a twat.

21:24.776 --> 21:27.855
Let's see what's on the telly.

21:27.856 --> 21:31.855
All that money and effort spent
fixing the place up, and look at it.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.815
I'll, er...

21:33.816 --> 21:36.695
I'll get Chesney and Carl
to give us a hand...

21:36.696 --> 21:40.695
have it sorted in no time.

21:40.896 --> 21:42.575
Stop worrying, will ya?

21:42.576 --> 21:45.655
Just wanted it nice for your mam.

21:45.656 --> 21:48.695
It will be.

21:50.016 --> 21:51.055
You OK?

21:54.136 --> 21:55.255
Shit!

21:55.256 --> 21:58.655
No! No!

21:58.656 --> 21:59.495
What is it? What's wrong?

21:59.496 --> 22:03.495
What is it? What's wrong?
Help me! It's Cilla!

22:10.656 --> 22:12.735
Doctor said there are two other

22:12.736 --> 22:16.735
people in here with the same thing.
Carpet fitters.

22:19.696 --> 22:21.895
The carpet's made them sick?

22:21.896 --> 22:24.975
Impregnated with chemicals
to make it easy to clean.

22:24.976 --> 22:28.975
It was over-treated and rejected, so
shop had carpet they couldn't sell.

22:29.416 --> 22:31.055
Till they saw you coming.

22:31.056 --> 22:35.055
You nearly killed my baby.

22:35.936 --> 22:36.815
Don't be stupid!

22:36.816 --> 22:39.735
You brought that carpet
into my house.

22:39.736 --> 22:42.015
We had no idea it was...

22:42.016 --> 22:43.615
It's all down to you!

22:43.616 --> 22:47.615
Cos my baby's in intensive care
and Shane's fucking not!

22:47.896 --> 22:49.295
Mimi, they're both...

22:49.296 --> 22:51.335
Liar! Liar!

22:51.336 --> 22:53.855
If you're looking
for someone to blame,

22:53.856 --> 22:57.535
if you hadn't taken a bag of spuds
to the park instead of your daughter,

22:57.536 --> 22:59.775
maybe this'd be
playing out differently...

22:59.776 --> 23:02.375
maybe it'd just be Shane
lying in a hospital bed.

23:02.376 --> 23:05.175
Or is that what you would've wanted?

23:05.176 --> 23:07.015
Yes.

23:07.016 --> 23:11.015
Yes, it is.

23:14.495 --> 23:17.148
I may not look it,
but I'm due for retirement soon.

23:17.159 --> 23:18.838
You'll never retire.

23:18.839 --> 23:21.198
Give it another year
and I'm calling it a day.

23:21.199 --> 23:24.318
What about the business?
Hand it over to Rodney?

23:24.319 --> 23:26.758
He'd have the place
closed down within a week.

23:26.759 --> 23:27.998
He'd either be dead or back inside.

23:27.999 --> 23:30.838
You should think about asking Kelly.

23:30.839 --> 23:34.838
You know, like a manager,
but make sure you're looked after.

23:34.839 --> 23:38.838
She'd do a great job
and you'd get peace of mind.

23:41.719 --> 23:45.718
I want my eggs sunny side up.

23:45.919 --> 23:47.558
You? Making breakfast?

23:47.559 --> 23:49.718
Don't act so surprised.

23:49.719 --> 23:51.518
I'm fucking floored.

23:51.519 --> 23:53.198
Dad's taking me into town later
to buy me some new trainers.

23:53.199 --> 23:54.998
I'm not.

23:54.999 --> 23:58.558
You are. You promised, remember?

23:58.559 --> 24:01.758
I promised you breakfast.

24:01.759 --> 24:04.398
What's going on?

24:04.399 --> 24:06.278
You're right.

24:06.279 --> 24:07.958
Thanks for reminding me, babes.

24:07.959 --> 24:10.918
A treat for doing well in school.
I did promise.

24:10.919 --> 24:12.678
I don't fancy this any more.

24:12.679 --> 24:16.118
Think I might have
some cereal instead.

24:16.119 --> 24:18.398
Well, if you won't!

24:18.399 --> 24:20.078
Corn flakes.

24:20.079 --> 24:24.078
Waiting!

24:30.439 --> 24:31.638
You OK?

24:31.639 --> 24:35.638
Never better.

24:37.119 --> 24:41.118
Managed to pull Micky out of
a bonding session to let him know.

24:41.199 --> 24:42.558
Why don't we find a doctor,

24:42.559 --> 24:45.598
see if they can give you something
to help you get some rest?

24:45.599 --> 24:48.278
Knock me out, you mean?

24:48.279 --> 24:52.278
My face has got to be the first
Cilla sees when she wakes up.

24:53.679 --> 24:57.078
Why don't you go and
get us some coffees?

24:58.719 --> 25:00.678
Lillian.

25:00.679 --> 25:03.238
Will I get used to it?

25:03.239 --> 25:04.518
What?

25:04.519 --> 25:07.518
Feeling like this?
Being mad.

25:07.519 --> 25:10.718
One in four people in this
country are mentally unstable.

25:10.719 --> 25:14.718
Who are your three
closest relatives?

25:14.759 --> 25:16.518
Jamie, Micky and Shane.

25:16.519 --> 25:20.518
They seem OK.
You're probably the one.

25:22.479 --> 25:25.078
I know mad when I see it.

25:25.079 --> 25:26.718
And you are not it.

25:26.719 --> 25:28.798
You're tired, Mimi.

25:28.799 --> 25:30.318
You're overwhelmed.

25:30.319 --> 25:32.878
And I've gotta say it can't be easy
bringing a little one up

25:32.879 --> 25:36.878
when you thought
you'd put that behind you.

25:36.999 --> 25:40.398
She was my new start, Karen.
My new beginning.

25:40.399 --> 25:43.958
That's what I keep telling myself.

25:43.959 --> 25:46.558
I just want to do right by her.

25:46.559 --> 25:50.558
And I can't. Christ knows,
I've tried, but I can't.

25:50.799 --> 25:54.078
Hey, don't talk like that.

25:54.079 --> 25:55.998
If anything happens to her.

25:55.999 --> 25:59.998
It's all down to me. All of it.

26:08.399 --> 26:11.558
I've searched me conscience.
And searched me heart.

26:11.559 --> 26:15.558
And I swear down, I don't know what
I've done to deserve this.

26:20.119 --> 26:22.958
Oh, father, who art in heaven...

26:22.959 --> 26:25.398
Oh!

26:25.399 --> 26:27.838
I mean, apart from
the obvious, like...

26:27.839 --> 26:31.838
Oh, will you shut your
fuckin' moaning.

26:34.479 --> 26:36.998
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!

26:36.999 --> 26:38.078
For what?

26:38.079 --> 26:42.078
Swearing like a tuppeny whore.
You're Mary, the mother of Christ.

26:42.079 --> 26:44.558
Mandy...

26:44.559 --> 26:47.958
The mother of little Joe.

26:47.959 --> 26:51.958
After that ginger gobshite?

26:52.079 --> 26:55.678
You're dead and you're
still sweet on him? How? Why?

26:55.679 --> 26:58.518
We're still kind of
seeing each other.

26:58.519 --> 27:00.838
Back to you, what's going on?

27:00.839 --> 27:02.438
Hang on, what are you doing here?

27:02.439 --> 27:05.398
You're not after taking my Cilla
to the other side,

27:05.399 --> 27:07.038
escorting her to the bosom of Jesus.

27:07.039 --> 27:08.878
Mum, I'm not here to take Cilla!

27:08.879 --> 27:10.398
I'm here to try and sort you.

27:10.399 --> 27:13.238
I'm at me wit's end.
Micky's buggered off, and...

27:13.239 --> 27:16.678
Jamie's got that much to sort with
him and Karen, he's no use to me.

27:16.679 --> 27:19.878
And Shane and Kelly are hell bent
on seeing me homeless!

27:19.879 --> 27:20.478
Shane and Kelly?

27:20.479 --> 27:22.918
Redecorating, chucking me furniture.

27:22.919 --> 27:26.198
In a few months' time there'll be
no sign I was ever there at all.

27:26.199 --> 27:28.558
They're erasing me. They want me out!

27:28.559 --> 27:32.318
They want you in. That's why they're
doing it, you dozy mare.

27:32.319 --> 27:34.038
To make the place nicer for you.

27:34.039 --> 27:36.358
They're finishing off the job
you can't.

27:36.359 --> 27:39.238
There are people
taking advantage, Mum,

27:39.239 --> 27:40.438
but not your own flesh and blood.

27:40.439 --> 27:41.598
You just can't see it!

27:41.599 --> 27:44.678
I see everything.

27:44.679 --> 27:46.118
I'm omnipresent.

27:46.119 --> 27:47.998
I thought that was just God?

27:47.999 --> 27:51.158
He decided we all should be.
One of the perks.

27:51.159 --> 27:54.358
You need to sort this, Mum.
Get your house in order.

27:54.359 --> 27:57.918
I know someone's pulling a fast one,
and I know who!

27:57.919 --> 27:58.958
You're wrong.

27:58.959 --> 27:59.518
I know.

27:59.519 --> 28:00.158
I know.
You're wrong.

28:00.159 --> 28:01.038
I'm not. You are.

28:01.039 --> 28:02.198
No, you are.

28:02.199 --> 28:03.198
I'm fuckin' not.

28:03.199 --> 28:04.838
Fuckin' are!

28:04.839 --> 28:07.678
Am so fuckin' not!

28:07.679 --> 28:10.958
Oh, get fucked!

28:10.959 --> 28:12.958
Oi!

28:12.959 --> 28:16.398
If that's the insurance company,
you can forget it.

28:16.399 --> 28:17.598
You won't be cashing
in on me just yet.

28:17.599 --> 28:21.598
Bang goes the dream holiday, then.

28:23.839 --> 28:25.798
You really had me going there.

28:25.799 --> 28:29.798
Nah, constitution of an ox, me.

28:31.559 --> 28:35.558
In't that right, Mam?

28:37.599 --> 28:41.598
She's upset. Don't take much notice.

28:47.519 --> 28:50.038
How dare you walk away?
He's your son!

28:50.039 --> 28:52.638
My son who wants me dead.

28:52.639 --> 28:56.078
Everything we've done,
and it's been a fucking disaster

28:56.079 --> 28:58.718
from start to finish.
It's not just for me and Shane.

28:58.719 --> 29:02.718
It's for all of us.
For you, Cilla, Micky.

29:04.519 --> 29:07.478
It's for the family.

29:07.479 --> 29:09.558
He loves you, Mimi. You're his mum.

29:09.559 --> 29:11.518
He needs you.

29:11.519 --> 29:14.878
I want the pair of yous out my house.

29:14.879 --> 29:18.878
You're not welcome.

29:27.759 --> 29:31.758
Do you wanna sign Shane and Cilla's
get well card?

29:32.319 --> 29:33.718
What's wrong?

29:33.719 --> 29:37.718
My bracelet. I left it over there on
the dressing table and it's vanished.

29:39.919 --> 29:40.998
Was it a punter?

29:40.999 --> 29:44.998
I don't know. It was my mum's.
Lost her last year.

29:46.119 --> 29:47.198
Was she sick?

29:47.199 --> 29:48.998
Sick of living.

29:48.999 --> 29:51.558
Stepped in front of a train.

29:51.559 --> 29:55.558
She gave it to me the day before
and I knew something wasn't right.

29:55.999 --> 29:59.678
But I was all, "Oh, thanks, Mum."

29:59.679 --> 30:01.558
I still blame myself.

30:01.559 --> 30:03.478
You mustn't do that.

30:03.479 --> 30:07.478
Did you talk to anyone after?
Your dad? I haven't seen him in years.

30:08.999 --> 30:10.558
I'll talk to the girls.

30:10.559 --> 30:13.238
No, Lillian, please don't.

30:13.239 --> 30:15.118
I don't want any fuss.

30:15.119 --> 30:19.118
Promise you won't.

30:31.119 --> 30:32.598
Mam, it's all right.

30:32.599 --> 30:36.598
Cilla's gonna be fine.

30:47.799 --> 30:51.798
Mimi?
Mimi?

30:53.119 --> 30:56.078
Look. There's one of your kids
out there needs you.

30:56.079 --> 31:00.078
Well, more than one, but there's one
who's relying on you.

31:00.719 --> 31:02.438
Fuck, Mimi!

31:02.439 --> 31:06.358
She's been sick and she's scared
and there's only one person can

31:06.359 --> 31:09.478
make her feel better, and
unfortunately for her, that's you.

31:09.479 --> 31:12.918
So whatever it is you're on
or going through, drop the fucker

31:12.919 --> 31:16.238
and get your arse out there
and see to your daughter!

31:16.239 --> 31:19.438
I wanted her dead.

31:19.439 --> 31:22.838
What kind of warped fuck am I

31:22.839 --> 31:26.158
where I want my own flesh and blood
not to make it?

31:26.159 --> 31:29.718
But the thought of letting go,

31:29.719 --> 31:33.718
of not being responsible for
the first time in over 30 years.

31:35.919 --> 31:39.918
Of not being just someone's
mum any more, but being me.

31:42.119 --> 31:45.798
Do you know how
much I just wanna be me?

31:45.799 --> 31:48.318
She deserves better than that.

31:48.319 --> 31:52.318
She's beautiful
and everything I'm not.

31:54.759 --> 31:58.518
She needs someone better than me.

31:58.519 --> 32:00.038
I'm not good enough, Kelly.

32:00.039 --> 32:04.038
Well, you didn't do
such a bad job with Shane, Mimi.

32:13.879 --> 32:17.438
Found it. In her room!

32:17.439 --> 32:19.958
No, Lillian, I lent it to her.

32:19.959 --> 32:21.958
Remember, Trix?

32:21.959 --> 32:25.838
You asked if you could borrow
my bracelet and I said yes.

32:25.839 --> 32:28.878
I completely forgot.

32:28.879 --> 32:30.758
You're lying to me, aren't you?

32:30.759 --> 32:34.758
Bonnie, love, you can't let
people like Trixie take the piss.

32:36.919 --> 32:37.958
Come here.

32:37.959 --> 32:41.958
You're all heart,
that's your trouble.

32:44.439 --> 32:45.958
Hello, Cilla.

32:45.959 --> 32:49.958
Hello, yeah.

32:50.679 --> 32:54.678
Take her?

32:57.319 --> 33:01.318
Y'all right, then.

33:10.599 --> 33:14.598
I'm sorry. So sorry.

33:26.679 --> 33:30.678
You know what?

33:31.039 --> 33:33.518
I'm actually glad she threw us out.

33:33.519 --> 33:37.318
Sometimes you need that kick up
the arse to make you go see what's

33:37.319 --> 33:39.798
really important,
what you really want.

33:39.799 --> 33:41.598
Well...

33:41.599 --> 33:44.438
need.

33:44.439 --> 33:45.478
And you know what?

33:45.479 --> 33:47.838
This is it.

33:47.839 --> 33:51.838
This is it.

33:51.879 --> 33:54.838
Me and you.

33:54.839 --> 33:58.078
Auntie Anna dying taught me that.

33:58.079 --> 33:59.718
This is it.

33:59.719 --> 34:02.998
Mr and Mrs.

34:02.999 --> 34:06.998
Mr and Mrs.

34:20.174 --> 34:22.572
You weren't even gonna say goodbye?

34:22.574 --> 34:26.333
I can't stay, much as I'd love to.

34:26.333 --> 34:28.172
After that thing
with the bracelet,

34:28.174 --> 34:30.413
the other girls
have turned against me.

34:31.813 --> 34:35.293
Nothing. I try and talk
to them and they blank me.

34:35.293 --> 34:38.813
Then I see them whispering.
It's just...

34:38.813 --> 34:40.853
I can't stay where I'm not wanted.

34:40.853 --> 34:42.813
I'll have a word.

34:42.813 --> 34:46.293
I don't blame them. I come in here
and everything starts changing.

34:46.293 --> 34:48.733
Suddenly you and me
are best friends.

34:48.734 --> 34:52.733
It's obvious they're going to resent me.
It's just after all that stuff with my mum,

34:53.494 --> 34:56.053
I think I saw you
as a replacement for her.

34:56.054 --> 34:59.093
I'm in a vulnerable place right now.

34:59.094 --> 35:01.133
I'll look after you, then.

35:01.134 --> 35:02.733
It's not fair on you.

35:02.734 --> 35:05.893
Bye.And thank you, for everything.

35:05.894 --> 35:08.853
I need you!

35:08.854 --> 35:11.933
And I think you need me.
Not in a lezzie way,

35:11.934 --> 35:15.933
and I've never been a fan of muff.
Tried it once, it gave me lockjaw.

35:15.934 --> 35:18.093
So why can't we have each other?

35:18.094 --> 35:21.773
Be friends? Family, even?

35:21.774 --> 35:25.773
Come home, please.

35:32.294 --> 35:33.293
I want a bottle of vodka.

35:33.294 --> 35:35.933
And I want a voice like James Brown.

35:35.934 --> 35:37.933
I'll tell mum your little secret.

35:37.934 --> 35:40.933
Have you any idea
how hurtful this is?

35:40.934 --> 35:43.973
How distasteful?

35:43.974 --> 35:47.013
Cider or nothing, OK?

35:47.014 --> 35:51.013
I'll be ten minutes.

35:52.054 --> 35:54.453
D'you know what?

35:54.454 --> 35:56.493
No. You can't have it.

35:56.494 --> 35:58.333
I'll tell her.

35:58.334 --> 36:00.853
Then tell her.
It'll be embarrassing,

36:00.854 --> 36:03.733
you'll put us in a position
we don't want to be in,

36:03.734 --> 36:06.333
but if you want to risk
all that then tell her.

36:06.334 --> 36:10.093
Tell her what?

36:10.094 --> 36:11.333
Dad's been...

36:11.334 --> 36:15.333

36:22.614 --> 36:25.053
Pot the pink!

36:25.054 --> 36:27.133
And that's it.

36:27.134 --> 36:29.733
It's not pretty, I'm not proud.

36:29.734 --> 36:33.733
That's what I did,
and I'm sorry. Happy now?

36:33.774 --> 36:35.293

36:35.294 --> 36:36.453

40:49.894 --> 40:51.053
It's gotta be what, two grand?

40:51.054 --> 40:52.213
Three and a half.

40:52.214 --> 40:54.293
Fuck me, what next?!

40:54.294 --> 40:57.053
A website, punters book online.

40:57.054 --> 40:59.813
Double your trade overnight
with the right web designer.

40:59.814 --> 41:03.253
I hate to break it to you, but
this is not Spearmint fuckin' Rhino.

41:03.254 --> 41:05.773
Just leave the thinking
to me and Lillian, yeah?

41:05.774 --> 41:09.533
Where is she?
Where's Lillian?

41:09.534 --> 41:10.893
Out on business.

41:10.894 --> 41:11.973
What kind of business?

41:11.974 --> 41:15.853
Her own.

41:15.854 --> 41:17.613
OK.

41:17.614 --> 41:21.213
What man-made object built
over 2,000 years ago

41:21.214 --> 41:23.853
is said to be visible from space?

41:23.854 --> 41:26.213
The Trafford Centre!

41:26.214 --> 41:29.693
S'one hell of a bronzy for a few
days' team building in the sticks.

41:29.694 --> 41:33.333
Er, yeah, it's out of a bottle.
It'll wash off in a few days.

41:33.334 --> 41:34.133
Was it hard, though?

41:34.134 --> 41:38.133
♪ I'm sure you will find
many ways to have a good time... ♪

41:39.454 --> 41:42.093
Go on, get it all in. Ooh!

41:42.094 --> 41:46.093
Pretty much all the time.
They had us up all hours.

41:46.414 --> 41:49.773
What liquid is also known as H2O?

41:49.774 --> 41:53.653
By the way, we're sorted. Jamie
says we can crash here for a bit.

41:53.654 --> 41:57.653
And what was Hitler's first name?

41:57.854 --> 41:58.933
Heil!

42:05.814 --> 42:09.813
Chocka tonight.

42:18.734 --> 42:21.573
I just wanted to apologise
for earlier,

42:21.574 --> 42:24.213
you know, when the men were
delivering the tanning beds?

42:24.214 --> 42:27.733
I was stressed out really bad.
I think I was a bit off with you.

42:27.734 --> 42:30.933
A bit?

42:30.934 --> 42:32.933
Trixie told me about the bracelet.

42:32.934 --> 42:36.093
Yeah, it was a misunderstanding.
It's all sorted now.

42:36.094 --> 42:39.493
Not really, cos she reckons
she'd never seen it

42:39.494 --> 42:41.933
before Lillian started
waving it in her face.

42:41.934 --> 42:44.013
She never asked to borrow it,
and defo never stole it.

42:44.014 --> 42:45.773
I'm not a liar!

42:45.774 --> 42:49.773
Neither's Trixie.
And she's not a thief.

42:58.694 --> 43:01.733
You know what?
It really is none of my business

43:01.734 --> 43:03.293
as long as Lillian's happy.

43:03.294 --> 43:07.293
Oh, she is.

43:13.214 --> 43:16.773
Who wrote Robinson Crusoe?

43:16.774 --> 43:20.773
What did Sir Walter Raleigh bring
back to England from the New World?

43:22.254 --> 43:24.133
The bike!

43:24.134 --> 43:26.413
Lillian, will you shut the fuck up?!

43:28.254 --> 43:31.773
Little Miss Sunshine over there,
joined at the hip with Lillian.

43:31.774 --> 43:34.453
I thought you were letting go?
Living your life?

43:34.454 --> 43:36.573
There's something up there, Shane.

43:36.574 --> 43:38.733
Look, Lillian's run
that place for donkeys.

43:38.734 --> 43:42.413
She's survived two recessions,
fought off police, nutters in rubber,

43:42.414 --> 43:46.413
her husband getting shot and a son with all the
charm and appeal of a young Charles Manson.

43:47.894 --> 43:49.173
Bonnie, I think she can handle.

43:49.174 --> 43:53.173
And your last question
this round is...

43:55.334 --> 43:59.333
Look, we just grab
our stuff and go, yeah?

44:02.894 --> 44:05.533
Come in.
But first...

44:05.534 --> 44:09.533
close your eyes.

44:11.614 --> 44:14.053
Open them now.

44:14.054 --> 44:18.053
Karen told me the way to inner peace
was to finish what you started.

44:18.494 --> 44:22.253
So I looked around me house to see the
things I'd started, but hadn't finished.

44:22.254 --> 44:26.253
As well as this room, I finished a
bottle of wine, a bottle of Baileys,

44:26.454 --> 44:29.893
a tub of ice cream, a packet of
Penguins, the last of the Prozac,

44:29.894 --> 44:33.693
the rest of the cheesecake,
and a box of Black Magic.

44:33.694 --> 44:37.693
Can't tell you how good I feel!

44:38.814 --> 44:42.813
Will you stay?

44:43.934 --> 44:47.133
Course we will.

44:47.134 --> 44:49.973
But there are rules, OK?

44:49.974 --> 44:53.973
My rules.

44:56.654 --> 45:00.413
'And sometimes, when you
get it right, it works.

45:00.414 --> 45:04.413
'Extend the hand of friendship -
might get it slapped now and again,

45:04.814 --> 45:08.333
'but keep on putting it out there...

45:08.334 --> 45:12.333
'..and one day, someone'll take it.
And you can make that difference.

45:12.454 --> 45:16.213
'And, who knows, in years to come,
you might prove that theory wrong.

45:16.214 --> 45:19.893
'Everyone will remember your name -
not cos you were just there, but

45:19.894 --> 45:23.893
'because you shone a little light,
filled a hole, made a difference.'

45:26.014 --> 45:27.093
Is that it?

45:27.094 --> 45:27.773
That's it.

45:27.774 --> 45:28.453
All legal.

45:28.454 --> 45:29.213
Yep.

45:29.214 --> 45:31.253
I can't believe that's it.

45:31.254 --> 45:34.333
You're a bit too old for adoption,
but a legal name change,

45:34.334 --> 45:37.173
that's a step in the right direction.

45:37.174 --> 45:39.853
Welcome to the family, Bonnie Tyler.

45:39.854 --> 45:43.853
Thanks, Mum!

45:45.214 --> 45:47.773
I've got better things to do than
watch you earn minimum wage.

45:47.774 --> 45:49.733
You know nothing about me.
Ditto.

45:49.734 --> 45:52.293
I've got so much love to give.
I just need someone to give it to.

45:52.294 --> 45:53.013
I want that thing out!

45:53.014 --> 45:57.013
Got a couple of cars need your
Midas touch over the next few days.

45:57.094 --> 45:59.773
How am I going to drive for Jamie
tomorrow? You'll have to.

45:59.774 --> 46:00.373
Brake, now!

46:03.414 --> 46:05.373
Something missing
off our washing line.

46:05.374 --> 46:06.413
What?

46:06.414 --> 46:09.133
My knickers! There's
a sexual deviant on the loose!

46:09.134 --> 46:11.584
Throw a rock round here,
you'd hit a dozen.
