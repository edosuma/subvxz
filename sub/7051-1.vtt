<i><b>RAM</b></i>

19:53.728 --> 19:56.938
He seemed beating someone.
But no one was there.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.746
He fell as if someone beat him.

19:59.014 --> 20:00.559
But no one was beating him.

20:00.559 --> 20:01.532
All he was alone

20:01.687 --> 20:04.203
He was fighting with nobody.
He was beaten by nobody.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.718
He surrendered to police
saying he murdered him.

20:16.117 --> 20:21.453
Though Gautam didn't murdered but police
created the sensation and made him murder.

20:21.453 --> 20:23.888
So without killing anyone
Gautam became a murderer.

20:23.888 --> 20:25.243
This is the Gautam's reality

20:26.905 --> 20:28.014
Here is no any dead body Sir.

20:28.014 --> 20:29.380
What is the reason
behind doing this?

20:29.380 --> 20:30.672
This is the things
that we should know

20:45.130 --> 20:46.667
Who are you, son?

20:47.250 --> 20:48.564

20:48.615 --> 20:50.809

20:51.235 --> 20:52.533
Mother...
Mother?

20:52.533 --> 20:53.563
Mother...

20:53.563 --> 20:55.576
Father...
Mother...

20:55.576 --> 20:56.948
They killed them

20:57.058 --> 20:57.933
Where?

21:04.066 --> 21:05.562
Here...
Mother...

21:08.784 --> 21:10.361
Here...
They killed my Mother here.

21:10.361 --> 21:12.084
Here...
They killed my father here.

21:23.530 --> 21:24.800
Did any murder happen here?

21:25.146 --> 21:26.666
Muder?
Nothing like that happened...

21:26.666 --> 21:27.749
Why are you saying that Sir?

21:27.749 --> 21:30.051
This boy is saying that his
parents were killed here

21:30.051 --> 21:32.594
This boy?
This boy is always like that Sir.

21:32.594 --> 21:34.755
Whatever bus stops here, he
immediately gets in

21:34.755 --> 21:37.449
and says "here they killed my
mother and here my father".

21:38.988 --> 21:41.247
He's little mentle Sir.
Don't take it serious Sir.

22:16.868 --> 22:18.889
He doesnot have
father and mother.

22:27.687 --> 22:30.242
Without killing anyone,
Gautam became a murder

22:31.579 --> 22:33.961
He's little mentle Sir.
Don't take it serious Sir.

22:34.026 --> 22:37.352
This is called interrogation
disorder in medical terminology.

22:41.276 --> 22:45.413
Comparing to normal brain, gray matter
is 25% less in Gautam's brain.

22:51.147 --> 22:55.369
Means it reduces the
strength to remember.

22:55.746 --> 22:59.611
 They thinks those things as
real which are fictitious.

22:59.611 --> 23:02.083
 Gautam doesn't have his
parents since childhood

23:02.083 --> 23:03.696
He imagined them to
be there with him.

23:03.724 --> 23:06.027
Whatever he do, that won't be ture.
That's why

23:06.052 --> 23:10.993
he imagined they were killed by those three
who are right now trying to kill him.

23:11.018 --> 23:14.380
Revenging them, he feel
that he killed them.

23:14.835 --> 23:17.578
As a whole he created
a revenge story.

23:17.578 --> 23:21.491
Knowing that all as unreal
he got very disturbed.

23:21.491 --> 23:23.357
You don't worry. I'll treat him.

23:38.293 --> 23:41.218
Now I'm going to ask you
something relating to your past.

23:41.827 --> 23:43.939
Do you how does
your mother looks?

23:50.605 --> 23:53.220
Do you how does
your mother looks?

23:54.150 --> 23:55.838
I don't know.

23:57.199 --> 23:59.246
Do you know how does
your father looks?

24:05.313 --> 24:07.716
You don't know how was
your father and mother

24:07.716 --> 24:09.242
But somebody killed them.

24:10.608 --> 24:12.873
At least do you know the name
of your mother and father?

24:13.165 --> 24:14.179
You don't know.

24:14.463 --> 24:17.174
Do you know the name of the killers?
You don't know.

24:17.174 --> 24:20.293
You don't know the name of
killers but you killed them.

24:22.449 --> 24:26.542
So you killed those who you don't know
and where they are you don't know.

24:32.295 --> 24:35.021
It may not be true
that I killed them

24:36.522 --> 24:38.569
But its true that they
killed my parents.

24:38.569 --> 24:40.133
Every patient always says that

24:40.133 --> 24:42.363
No one will accept that
they are wrong.

24:42.363 --> 24:43.964
I've seen such cases many times

24:43.964 --> 24:45.528
What I'm saying is the truth.

24:45.528 --> 24:48.376
I've the medical reports to prove
that what you are saying is not real.

24:48.859 --> 24:50.877
What to you have?
Do you have any proof?

24:57.328 --> 24:58.959
It this real?

24:58.959 --> 24:59.802
Ofcourse. Damn it

24:59.802 --> 25:00.918
How do you know?

25:00.918 --> 25:02.812
Pain.
It pains man.

25:03.008 --> 25:06.166
As much you feel that pain
and believe it as real

25:06.166 --> 25:08.511
I feel mine too and
believed it as real.

25:11.993 --> 25:15.406
Why?
Why am I not imagining you?

25:15.406 --> 25:17.932
Why I'm not imagining you?
Why I'm not imagining you?

25:18.321 --> 25:20.519
Why I'm imagining those three?

25:20.644 --> 25:23.657
Because...
Those...

25:23.657 --> 25:25.037
Those three killed my parents.

25:30.838 --> 25:34.743
Do you think a chance that people
Gautam imagining are real?

25:34.743 --> 25:35.491
Impossible.

25:35.491 --> 25:37.586
What if they are Real?

25:38.788 --> 25:39.895
IMPOSSIBLE.

26:03.657 --> 26:06.902
What truth comes from
what type of experiment?

26:06.902 --> 26:09.455
Which truth affect
the which company?

26:09.455 --> 26:10.823
You are the one who knows that.

26:10.823 --> 26:14.245
What is that? Don't you know to
whom you dare will take your life?

26:14.466 --> 26:19.540
Do you think I stopped murdering
after entering to the politics?

26:19.540 --> 26:21.130
Nobody can dump the truth.

26:21.130 --> 26:24.767
Because of you company products,
the climate is polluting

26:24.767 --> 26:27.806
causing the different types of cancer.
People are dying.

26:27.844 --> 26:31.793
They don't have any alternatives.
So they are dying.

26:31.793 --> 26:35.074
You know the truth that's why
I'm giving you two choices.

26:35.897 --> 26:39.277
Do you need money?
Or do you want you life?

26:39.277 --> 26:40.668
How many will you kill?

26:40.668 --> 26:44.912
One...Two or Three...
Or will you kill all?

26:46.281 --> 26:51.125
As soon as I called you came without fear.
I thought you were here for the money.

26:51.125 --> 26:53.374
I understood that you
don't need your life.

26:53.949 --> 26:57.283
My friend has the
information that I'm here.

26:57.847 --> 27:01.138
If you kill me, everyone
will know about it.

27:01.935 --> 27:07.213
Everyone says when I murder there
will be no any proof because

27:16.599 --> 27:21.611
When I thought of murdering, these
types of accedent will happen there.

27:34.089 --> 28:34.120

29:07.141 --> 29:08.685

29:08.685 --> 29:10.795
Sorry. Whom do you
imagined to kill?

29:11.184 --> 29:12.965
They tried to kill me.

29:13.265 --> 29:16.039
Oh you imagined that?
It seems attacks did happen here.

29:16.039 --> 29:17.598
It appears to be realistic.

29:17.598 --> 29:19.203
But who are they to attack you?

29:19.203 --> 29:22.144
That one Sir.
Sir killed that one with the beer bottle, right?

29:22.144 --> 29:23.545
His men had came to attack him.

29:23.545 --> 29:24.863
But fearing him, they ran away.

29:24.863 --> 29:26.635
Lets go and catch
them who ran away.

29:26.635 --> 29:28.635
But we don't know
how they looks.

29:31.725 --> 29:33.177
Sir what is he searching?

29:35.658 --> 29:37.260
What are you searching?

29:37.392 --> 29:38.459
Camera.

I've taken their photos.

29:40.837 --> 29:43.248
This time he is imagined

29:43.881 --> 29:46.236
How long you search,
you won't find that.

29:46.236 --> 29:48.249
You killed with the bottle,
but there won't be the body.

29:48.249 --> 29:50.088
You take the photos, but
there won't be the camera.

29:50.088 --> 29:52.081
You just will imagine that
and I'll get the suspened.

29:52.081 --> 29:53.691
Once believing you
they called me a fool.

29:53.691 --> 29:56.238
Twice believing you they will call...
John Badshah...

29:56.238 --> 29:59.443
They'll say that because only John
Badshah knows how this happened.

29:59.443 --> 30:01.679
How Sir?
How...? Means I'll tell you

30:06.070 --> 30:07.977

30:18.834 --> 30:19.954
Tell us.
What do you say?

30:19.954 --> 30:22.578
I haven't broke anything. Everything
is done imagining by him.

30:22.578 --> 30:23.835
Go and ask Rockstar Gautam

30:23.835 --> 30:26.730
Tell us Gautam?
You did this all?

30:35.104 --> 30:38.672
Mr. Gautam can you prove that
really the attacks was real?

30:38.672 --> 30:42.359
Things doesnot always becomes unreal
when it doesn't has any proof and vice versa

30:42.359 --> 30:44.576
There are also the truth
beyond the camera.

30:59.856 --> 31:02.485

31:11.332 --> 31:13.404
This all might not be real

31:13.404 --> 31:17.030
But I don't need any those reality which force
me to believe that my past is falsehood.

31:17.030 --> 31:18.932
Till now for what I
believed and lived

31:19.303 --> 31:21.858
After hearing that were not Real.
I became unable bear it.

31:21.858 --> 31:24.335
Thats why.... the people
they believe unreal

31:24.335 --> 31:27.746
which I believed it to be real.
I'm going near to that.

31:33.095 --> 31:34.310

31:36.694 --> 31:38.353

31:40.880 --> 31:43.739

31:45.771 --> 31:46.749
Don't run.

31:47.135 --> 31:48.378
Gautam... Stop dear

31:49.505 --> 31:50.557
Don't run dear.

31:50.706 --> 31:51.758
Excuse me Sir.

32:00.353 --> 32:02.275
I said stop...

32:13.271 --> 32:17.840
Where were you running?

32:30.474 --> 32:33.688
Due to use of seeds,
land is becoming infertile

32:33.688 --> 32:36.165
Animals are dying,
people are suffering

32:36.165 --> 32:39.590

Animals are dying.

32:48.825 --> 32:51.185
Nobody is taking interest.
God must come to save it.

32:51.185 --> 32:55.455
NGOS are saying about Hydrogen Cyanide
getting mixed in the seeds.

32:55.775 --> 32:58.005
This is the report.
Government should now...

32:59.135 --> 33:00.695

At last. To meet you means I've to
come in a speed boat like James Bond.

34:12.650 --> 34:13.982
How did you know that I'm here?

34:13.982 --> 34:15.636
Your bad luck Sir.

34:15.636 --> 34:17.428

where ever you go.

34:17.428 --> 34:20.379
What do you want?
Just 10 minutes. Small interview.

34:20.379 --> 34:22.295
Don't you know the
meaning of privacy?

34:22.295 --> 34:23.637
Where ever you go and disturb.

34:25.658 --> 34:28.498
Knowing the value of privacy, if I
hadn't telecasted your footage in TV

34:28.498 --> 34:31.222
You'll not be here but
relaxing in the jail.

34:31.222 --> 34:32.690
Just get out from here.

34:33.620 --> 34:37.022
Fine. I know the value of
privacy so I'm going right now.

If you say no and neglect it
then I'll jump in the sea.

35:00.325 --> 35:01.790
Why are you coming again?

35:01.790 --> 35:02.924
Don't you understand
by saying once?

35:20.895 --> 35:23.425
That means you imagined
me coming here.

Generally fans imagine about you.

35:28.025 --> 35:30.810

35:46.506 --> 35:47.614
What do you need?

35:47.614 --> 35:50.795
Don't give the interview.
It seems you don't like interview.

35:50.795 --> 35:51.993
Tell me... Tell me...

35:51.993 --> 35:53.235
What else do you imagined?

35:53.235 --> 35:56.127
What questions did I ask you?
What answers you gave?

35:56.127 --> 35:57.876
I didn't have behave

35:57.876 --> 36:01.552
If I don't come to beatles at evening
5:30, you threatned to jump in the sea.

36:01.552 --> 36:02.544
Did I say that?

36:02.544 --> 36:04.269
So...thats my character.
My character.

36:04.269 --> 36:05.503
I too will be saying that.

36:05.503 --> 36:08.622
Lets do one thing.
Lets make your dream true.

36:08.622 --> 36:10.927
Evening 5:30. Come to the Beatles Shop.

36:10.927 --> 36:13.149
Not for interview.
Small treat for you.

36:13.849 --> 36:17.680
I'll remember life long
coming to GOA for you.

36:17.680 --> 36:20.150
Please please Sir.

36:20.150 --> 36:21.988
Lets make your dream true.

36:21.988 --> 36:23.624
One coffee Sir.

36:23.941 --> 36:26.149
Mr. Rockstar...
Remember it...

36:26.149 --> 36:30.176
A Star can live without AC but
can't survive without fans.

36:30.176 --> 36:34.357
5:30 Beatles. If not then
I'll jump in the sea

36:47.504 --> 36:48.974
You came here?

36:48.974 --> 36:50.590
I can't believe this.

36:50.590 --> 36:52.493
Actually I thought
you won't come here.

36:52.493 --> 36:54.039
I've been egarly
waiting for this.

36:54.039 --> 36:56.118
I won't take times. Just 10 minutes.
That's all.

36:56.118 --> 36:57.125
Order for the coffee.

36:57.125 --> 36:59.976
Good idea. Lets take the interview
while drinkin the coffee.

37:02.096 --> 37:05.302
What interview?
You said about the treat.

37:05.302 --> 37:07.645
Generally people thinks
my interview as a treat.

37:07.645 --> 37:08.735
Are you playing the game?

37:08.849 --> 37:10.738
Because I said no
for the interview.

37:10.738 --> 37:12.901
So you are lying saying
about the treat.

37:14.030 --> 37:15.276
What treat?

37:15.276 --> 37:20.018
5:30 Beatles. I thought you
came for the interview.

37:20.018 --> 37:22.039
If you want to have coffee with
me, then ask for the coffee?

37:22.039 --> 37:24.486
If you want the interview
then ask for the interview?

37:24.486 --> 37:25.772
But don't act like this.

37:25.772 --> 37:27.270
Cheap media tricks.

37:29.293 --> 37:31.418
Look Mr. Gautam

37:31.457 --> 37:34.473
Don't think that every girls from
India wants to have coffee with you

37:34.473 --> 37:38.561
We journalists come for the interviews.
Not for the coffee.

37:38.561 --> 37:41.098
So, thank you.

37:48.886 --> 37:50.987
You arrived earlier then me?

37:55.678 --> 37:58.071
You Rockstar shouldn't
come earlier.

37:58.071 --> 38:01.318
The late the hero arrives,
the more will be the craze.

38:03.946 --> 38:05.996
What happened?
Why are you looking like that?

38:05.996 --> 38:07.991
Again did that
interview girl came?

38:07.991 --> 38:10.096
Did she again irratated you..?

38:10.832 --> 38:13.728
Again she tried to use you?

38:15.262 --> 38:17.747
I swear.
I'll Kill her.

38:24.103 --> 38:25.461
Lets order the coffee.

38:25.461 --> 38:28.312
Lets have the coffee and
make your dream true.

38:28.312 --> 38:29.613
I feel like an angel.

38:35.047 --> 38:38.535
Actually... I don't know...whether
we can find here coffee or not

38:38.535 --> 38:41.053
But in first meet, beer
won't be good, right?

38:41.053 --> 38:43.175
That's why I said coffee.
Sorry.

38:43.175 --> 38:44.300
Anyway I'll try for it.

38:54.146 --> 38:57.254
I'm the real one.
You don't have to test on me.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.359
But your touch is wonderful.

38:59.718 --> 39:01.992
What?
Yet you don't believe me?

39:01.992 --> 39:02.882
Wait...

39:04.495 --> 39:05.353
Am I hot?

39:08.073 --> 39:10.989
Did you see that? They don't
even want to disturb us.

39:10.989 --> 39:12.747
I feel like an angel.

40:00.923 --> 40:02.885
Where are you going?

40:03.975 --> 40:05.478
So you are imagining swimming?

40:05.478 --> 40:07.579
Please Please Please imagine
both of us swimming together...

40:07.579 --> 40:08.749
It would be good.

40:08.749 --> 40:10.215
Lets make that too true.

40:10.215 --> 40:11.141
What? Ok?

40:11.141 --> 40:12.904
First drink the coffee.

40:14.674 --> 40:16.151
What the hell?

40:16.151 --> 40:17.743
Bloody bastard. Are
you blind or what?

40:17.743 --> 40:19.265
Are you driving drinking
alchol or what?

40:19.265 --> 40:22.622
Bloody dog.
Stupid Jackass

40:22.622 --> 40:24.886
Do you think this beach as
your father's property?

40:24.886 --> 40:26.501
Bloody drunkard.

40:26.706 --> 40:28.167
Oh shit. My coffe is gone.

40:28.167 --> 40:29.517
Shall I bring another coffee?

40:43.412 --> 40:46.931
What Sameera? Suddenly you
claim yourself too be hot.

40:47.140 --> 40:48.951
Do you know I
became like a dumb.

40:49.686 --> 40:53.323
Looking at the hot girls you boys become dumb.
That's why I asked you.

41:02.169 --> 41:03.645
How's my double acting?

41:03.645 --> 41:05.048
I did well, right?

41:05.399 --> 41:09.920
Journalist looks general but
Angel looks mindblowing.

41:09.920 --> 41:15.185
What is this? I thought you getting Rockstar
is hard but he is easily fell on you.

41:15.185 --> 41:16.301
What are you watching?

41:16.301 --> 41:18.471
How does Angel changes her
dress, I'm looking that.

41:18.471 --> 41:19.827
What?
-Dress change???

41:26.537 --> 41:28.513
Why did you record this?

41:28.513 --> 41:30.598
To increase the TRP for
your double acting.

41:31.786 --> 41:33.095
Why are you beating me?

41:33.095 --> 41:34.357
Did TRP increase now?

41:34.357 --> 41:35.629
Stupid.

41:36.654 --> 41:38.630
What's the Gautam
program tomorrow?

42:02.139 --> 42:05.052
What Sir? After seeing me too
why are walking so silently?

42:05.052 --> 42:08.099
Rather than staying free,
can't you give the interview?

42:10.545 --> 42:12.396
It's me Angel.

42:12.743 --> 42:15.671
You believed me that I'm
interview girl, right?

42:15.671 --> 42:17.260
Last time you missed
the coffe, right?

42:17.260 --> 42:20.628
This Angel will go and bring the coffee.
Till then you watch them and enjoy.

42:22.552 --> 42:27.400
I forgot something. I think I didn't come to
GOA just to have only coffe with you, right?

42:27.400 --> 42:29.218
Then why I'm here for?

42:32.925 --> 42:34.226
What?

42:35.904 --> 42:38.449
It means I Love You
in Kokani language.

42:38.449 --> 42:39.642
I really like you.

42:39.642 --> 42:42.038
If you catch me right now then
its means NO from your side.

42:42.038 --> 42:43.955
If not then it means
YES from your side.

42:43.980 --> 42:47.033
If you don't catch me now then this
Angel will not leave you forever.

42:49.712 --> 42:51.210
No.

42:51.569 --> 42:52.494
What "No"?

42:52.494 --> 42:53.882
Right now you said that...

42:53.882 --> 42:55.255
Awww Tuzo Moh Karta
(I Love You).

42:55.255 --> 42:56.111
What do you mean?

42:56.111 --> 42:57.958
As you said I Love
you in Konkani.

42:57.958 --> 42:59.805
Excuse me.
Will you leave my hands please?

42:59.805 --> 43:01.053
I'm saying to you?

43:01.589 --> 43:03.812
Mr. Gautam. Why do you
visualize so cheap about me?

43:03.812 --> 43:06.136
When I call for the treat,
you presuppose it as treat

43:06.136 --> 43:08.330
You presume saying me I Love
You when I walk near by you.

43:08.330 --> 43:09.287
What is your next plan?

43:09.287 --> 43:10.659
Will you visualize
our dating or what?

43:11.412 --> 43:13.426
Anyway you won't give
me the interview.

43:13.426 --> 43:16.977
At least I want to cover it from a distant.
Won't you let me to do that too peacefully?

43:17.083 --> 43:21.558
Mr. Gautam don't visualize that every girls from
India will express their love to Rockstars like you

43:21.558 --> 43:24.618
We journalists come for
interviews not for dates.

43:35.279 --> 43:37.529
Actually I really
expressed my love to you

43:37.529 --> 43:40.823
But I can't tolerate no from you so
acted right now as interview girl.

43:41.509 --> 43:45.253
Grils coming and expressing their
love to a Rockstar like you

43:45.253 --> 43:47.925
And you rejecting them
may common to you.

43:47.925 --> 43:52.130
But for normal girl like
me its a major issue.

43:52.686 --> 43:54.444
I really like you.

43:54.828 --> 43:57.303
At least give me a chance to
become your one day girl friend.

43:57.411 --> 43:59.472
I'll keep it for my
life long memory.

43:59.672 --> 44:01.430
You are not real.

44:01.430 --> 44:02.472
You are just fictional.

44:02.472 --> 44:04.588
No no no. I'm genuine.

44:04.588 --> 44:05.708
You want me to prove it?

44:13.457 --> 44:15.954
Everybody will envision me as mentle
if I keep talking with you.

44:15.954 --> 44:18.017
I know you are not really here.

44:18.017 --> 44:19.901
I'm just imagining you.
That's all.

44:19.901 --> 44:20.728
Go.

44:20.728 --> 44:21.393
Go.

44:27.767 --> 44:29.566
How do you know that
I'm just fictional?

44:29.566 --> 44:31.583
If you were real then you
won't be here bringing coffee.

44:31.583 --> 44:32.938
You'll be talking angrily.

44:32.938 --> 44:33.449
What?

44:34.947 --> 44:36.293
You all men are alike.

44:36.293 --> 44:39.097
They think our love as
fictitiuos and anger as real.

44:39.097 --> 44:41.335
Is this angerness enough
to prove me as real?

44:41.335 --> 44:43.401
Or do I've murder someone?

44:43.401 --> 44:45.296
Just...just 2 minutes...

44:45.296 --> 44:46.836
I'm giving you 120 seconds time.

44:46.836 --> 44:50.198
I'll go and jump into the sea if you don't
take me as your one day girl friend.

45:01.760 --> 45:04.382
Is there... Is there a girl?

45:06.438 --> 45:08.120
White dress?
-Ya

45:08.120 --> 45:09.468
Yes, she is there.

45:12.239 --> 45:13.858
One minute?
-Yes.

45:13.923 --> 45:16.412
Are there two old
peoples in the table?

45:17.206 --> 45:18.592
Yaa they are having biscuits.

45:18.592 --> 45:19.794
They are there, right?
-Yes

45:25.970 --> 45:27.512
You'll die if you jump.

45:28.414 --> 45:30.766
I'm just fictitiuos.
How'll I die?

45:30.766 --> 45:32.705
No. You are in real.
I know it.

45:33.375 --> 45:35.298
Really? How did you know?

45:37.306 --> 45:39.613
The two old people
sitting there told me.

45:41.736 --> 45:43.008
Who?

45:43.008 --> 45:44.173
No one is there.

46:44.425 --> 46:46.836
Rockstar Gautam interestingly
looking at rubbish.

46:46.836 --> 46:49.856
What Sir? Are you imagining
something in here?

46:49.907 --> 46:51.441
He is in Real.

46:51.441 --> 46:52.948
He is right somewhere here?
-Who?

46:52.948 --> 46:55.503
Oh! The one you
killed in Hyderbad?

46:55.503 --> 46:57.182
He too came GOA along with you?

46:57.182 --> 47:00.509
I've seen him throwing this CAN.
This is enough to prove him real.

47:00.509 --> 47:01.638
Excuse me.

47:05.188 --> 47:06.312
This one is also real.

47:06.312 --> 47:09.927
This is GOA Sir. Its very
common to have such CAN.

47:09.927 --> 47:11.716
This CAN might be common
but he's not common.

47:11.716 --> 47:14.516
He has Mongolian face
with pony tail hair.

47:14.516 --> 47:16.717
He is apprearing in same pony
tail hair since my childhood.

47:16.717 --> 47:18.736
Thats not his hair style

47:18.736 --> 47:19.870
Russian Mafia.

47:20.885 --> 47:23.029
No need to search
him all around.

47:23.029 --> 47:24.625
Just GOA is enough to find him.

47:24.835 --> 47:29.066
Instead of thinking him and wasting
time, you can give your interview???

47:29.066 --> 47:30.201
One day girl friend?

47:30.201 --> 47:31.640
Interview?

47:31.640 --> 47:33.585
One day girl friend?
Interview?

47:33.585 --> 47:35.030
One day girl friend...

52:18.035 --> 52:22.376
That means "How am I?"
in Mongolian language.

52:22.744 --> 52:24.269
Sit down.

52:28.849 --> 52:32.271
Whenever you find others,
"How are you?" is asked.

52:32.560 --> 52:34.461
But I ask "How am I?"

52:34.461 --> 52:35.724
How am I?

52:35.724 --> 52:36.603
Same?

52:37.220 --> 52:38.989
Do I look exactly
as you imagined?

52:39.230 --> 52:40.589
Who am I?

52:40.589 --> 52:41.404
Funny.

52:41.404 --> 52:45.551
Instead of asking who am I,
you asking me who are you?

52:45.551 --> 52:46.958
You too do joke.

52:46.958 --> 52:49.182
I've seen my killing
episode in TV.

52:49.182 --> 52:51.159
The anger in your eyes...

52:51.958 --> 52:53.026
Thank God...

52:53.026 --> 52:55.804
I was not there, so its ok.

52:56.442 --> 52:58.616
If not, you've killed me so brutely.

52:58.616 --> 53:00.451
Thinking that too makes
me so scared.

53:00.451 --> 53:02.451
Who are my parents?

53:03.541 --> 53:05.125
Why do you killed them?

53:05.125 --> 53:08.321
I thought of killing you
before you aks me that.

53:08.321 --> 53:11.146
The  dash in the
beach...the boat...

53:11.146 --> 53:13.493
These are not the accidents.

53:13.493 --> 53:15.840
These are my plans to kill you.

53:16.105 --> 53:17.677
But... missed.

53:18.547 --> 53:19.932
As like your childhood.

53:20.482 --> 53:23.091
This time without any plans

53:23.091 --> 53:25.320
Get ready to die from my hands...

53:25.320 --> 53:26.240
Hello Rockstar...

53:27.632 --> 53:31.293
Are you here?
I'm searching you all over the market.

53:31.293 --> 53:34.491
Are you angry with me coz
I sang song in your tune.

53:34.986 --> 53:37.547
What a timing your
girl friend has?

53:38.262 --> 53:40.380
That time she appread
while you killing me.

53:40.380 --> 53:42.449
Now she is coming while
I'm going to kill you.

53:44.456 --> 53:46.297
Is she recording this too?

53:47.435 --> 53:48.555
No... no no no...

53:49.100 --> 53:50.726
I don't like to
have proof system.

53:50.726 --> 53:52.194
I don't leave any proofs.

54:12.912 --> 54:15.051
What? Will you kill me?

54:15.051 --> 54:17.483
Will you kill me if I want to be
your girl friend for one day?

54:29.676 --> 54:33.732
Its me... Looking good
scene around I came here.

54:40.605 --> 54:42.481
How many hours does it works?

54:42.481 --> 54:45.576
One bottle cap works for an
hour and full for whole day.

54:45.576 --> 54:48.030
Despite Tsunami too, the one
drinking this, will not woke.

55:06.732 --> 55:10.902

01:01:38.825 --> 01:01:40.871
How come we here?

01:01:41.437 --> 01:01:42.865

Somebody put fire in the yatch.

01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:51.250
They again attacked us.
We excaped from the boat.

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:53.261
Due to fire in that
too, we came here.

01:01:53.515 --> 01:01:55.601
Who saw the men putting
fire in the yatch?

01:01:55.601 --> 01:01:56.330
Its me.

01:01:56.330 --> 01:01:57.564
Who chase them?
-Its me.

01:01:57.564 --> 01:01:59.178
Who cut the rope?

01:01:59.823 --> 01:02:01.100
That too is you.

01:02:02.531 --> 01:02:04.351
Do I tell you what happened?

01:02:04.351 --> 01:02:06.571
You imagined someone
putting fire in the yatch.

01:02:06.571 --> 01:02:08.824
You cut the rope and
made me fly in the air.

01:02:08.824 --> 01:02:10.833
After that you imagined
someone chasing us.

01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:13.950
At last, you imagined
boat to be in fire and came here.

01:02:15.234 --> 01:02:18.009
Mr. Gautam. We didn't came here
because somebody attacked us

01:02:18.009 --> 01:02:20.072
We are here coz you
imagined that.

01:02:20.072 --> 01:02:21.398
What I'm saying is true.

01:02:21.398 --> 01:02:24.328
What you are saying is not real.
And me too is not real.

01:02:24.328 --> 01:02:24.890
Sameera.

01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:27.222
Sameera is not here. You are
just imagining her. Thats all.

01:02:59.788 --> 01:03:01.882
Don't you know the
meaning of privacy?

01:03:01.882 --> 01:03:03.536
Where ever you go
and disturb us.

01:03:04.136 --> 01:03:06.052
You arrived so soon.

01:03:06.052 --> 01:03:07.529
Actually I didn't
expect you to come.

01:03:28.145 --> 01:03:29.748
Its me shouting for you.

01:03:29.748 --> 01:03:31.001
Won't you talk with me?

01:03:31.001 --> 01:03:32.137
Will you just stay right here?

01:03:32.137 --> 01:03:33.182
That boat too left.

01:03:33.182 --> 01:03:35.118
Passing boats will
not care about us.

01:03:35.118 --> 01:03:37.734
Fishing boats will
be here tomorrow.

01:03:37.734 --> 01:03:40.203
Just stay one day
in this Island.

01:03:40.203 --> 01:03:41.155
You and me.

01:03:41.155 --> 01:03:43.928
I seems your "one day girl friend"
wish will be fulfilled today.

01:03:46.619 --> 01:03:49.411
Seriously. Will you accept me
as your one day girl friend?

01:03:49.411 --> 01:03:50.610
But you are fictitious, right?

01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:52.749
Who said that?
-You...yourself

01:03:52.749 --> 01:03:54.508
No..No.. I'm in real.

01:03:56.735 --> 01:03:58.184
Sit down.

01:03:59.122 --> 01:04:00.069
Stand up.

01:04:01.831 --> 01:04:02.941
Run in the water.

01:04:10.786 --> 01:04:13.867
That it. Whatever I'm imagining,
you are doing the same.

01:04:13.867 --> 01:04:14.773
You are fictitious.

01:04:16.575 --> 01:04:18.957
No.. no..no.. I'm just doing
what you're saying me to do.

01:04:18.957 --> 01:04:21.738
Exactly I thought of
saying that and you did.

01:04:23.243 --> 01:04:24.155
No...

01:04:24.155 --> 01:04:25.689
If you want then say again.

01:04:25.689 --> 01:04:26.895
I'll prove me as real.

01:04:30.273 --> 01:04:31.887
Kiss me.

01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:36.630
Hug me.

01:04:41.178 --> 01:04:43.075
You are not doing as I said.

01:04:43.614 --> 01:04:46.019
That means I'm imagining
that interview girl.

01:04:46.019 --> 01:04:49.019
One day girl friend will've
done whatever I said.

01:04:51.801 --> 01:04:53.262
Tightly.

01:05:08.096 --> 01:05:10.864
I thought that looking at
the romantic scene. Sorry.

01:05:10.864 --> 01:05:11.977
I'm imagining you.

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:17.467
I'm fictitious.
I accept that.

01:05:17.467 --> 01:05:19.775
Will you accept me as
your one day girl friend?

01:05:54.992 --> 01:05:56.824
I'm so happy.

01:05:56.824 --> 01:05:59.317
I didn't thought you will
express your love to me.

01:06:02.086 --> 01:06:04.314
You wantonly played
with me, right?

01:06:04.314 --> 01:06:05.751
You know I'm in real, right?

01:06:05.911 --> 01:06:07.405
I know you are real.

01:06:07.502 --> 01:06:09.616
But I had to know interview
girl as fictitious, right?

01:06:09.616 --> 01:06:10.963
Then what should we do?

01:06:11.608 --> 01:06:13.372
Then I've to take your interview.

01:06:13.372 --> 01:06:17.159
It that so? Ok ok. Rockstar
interviewing a jorunalist.

01:06:17.159 --> 01:06:19.851
Amazing. Nice TRP item. come on.

01:06:20.836 --> 01:06:21.948
What's your name?

01:06:21.948 --> 01:06:23.163
You know that.

01:06:23.163 --> 01:06:24.064
Its interview.

01:06:24.089 --> 01:06:24.905
Sameera.

01:06:24.905 --> 01:06:26.826
What do you do?
-I'm a journalist.

01:06:26.826 --> 01:06:27.993
What's your covered best news?

01:06:27.993 --> 01:06:30.617
Best news... to record
your murder scene.

01:06:30.617 --> 01:06:32.506
Sorry. Recording
Gautam murder news.

01:06:32.506 --> 01:06:34.685
I got famous from that.

01:06:34.685 --> 01:06:36.685
I lost my name(fame).

01:06:36.787 --> 01:06:40.194
Do Gautam has the past?
-No. He's just presumming it.

01:06:40.194 --> 01:06:41.475
What else did he assume?

01:06:41.475 --> 01:06:44.256
Many things. He is imagining
the interview girl too.

01:06:44.256 --> 01:06:46.498
That means interview girl is not real?
-Yeah

01:06:50.378 --> 01:06:53.297
This camera says that interview
girl is not fictitious.

01:06:58.441 --> 01:07:00.379
How much are they giving you?

01:07:00.379 --> 01:07:01.727
For telecasting this news.

01:07:02.807 --> 01:07:05.918
You are the first person
so close to my life.

01:07:07.033 --> 01:07:09.221
I thought you loved me?

01:07:09.221 --> 01:07:11.519
It would've been good
if your love was true.

01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:13.737
Don't play with me onwards.

01:07:15.342 --> 01:07:18.531
I have my past and
that's the reality.

01:07:18.531 --> 01:07:22.118
No one can make it
fasify. You too can't.

01:07:30.012 --> 01:07:33.354
You acted loving me. But don't
act like being in pain.

01:07:35.423 --> 01:07:37.959
It would've been good if
you're really fictitious.

01:08:08.611 --> 01:08:11.819
I'm the first person to
believe you having your past.

01:08:12.826 --> 01:08:15.017
I searched for your past.

01:08:15.017 --> 01:08:19.367
Nearly 20 years back, Inspector Maule
joined that boy here.

01:08:19.367 --> 01:08:21.087
I too don't remember properly

01:08:21.087 --> 01:08:23.001
I found alone him in the forest.

01:08:23.001 --> 01:08:26.279
He used to cry saying his
parents were murdered.

01:08:26.279 --> 01:08:29.011
After inquiring, nothing like that.

01:08:29.011 --> 01:08:32.278
He is first boy to run away
from our orpanage home.

01:08:32.278 --> 01:08:33.606
Thats why I remembered him.

01:08:33.606 --> 01:08:35.403
But I didn't any proof.

01:08:37.173 --> 01:08:38.897
Why I did this all, you know?

01:08:38.897 --> 01:08:41.799
He strongly believes
that he has his past.

01:08:41.799 --> 01:08:46.546
He just keep on imagining
only those three. Not others.

01:08:46.546 --> 01:08:48.546
We can't do anything about that.

01:08:48.555 --> 01:08:49.738
Then what can we do doctor?

01:08:49.827 --> 01:08:50.913
I'll tell you one

01:08:50.913 --> 01:08:54.959
If we can prove that he
imagine other people too then

01:08:54.959 --> 01:08:56.465
we can treat him.

01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:59.000
But thats impossible.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.182
Thats impossible.

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:03.906
No Doctor...
Its possible.

01:09:04.171 --> 01:09:06.310
Thats why I acted as two people.

01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:11.443
Whatever happened between us, if that
were real then how happy would I've been

01:09:11.443 --> 01:09:14.286
But in proving your reality
my love, became a lie.

01:09:14.286 --> 01:09:15.870
Which I couldn't bear.

01:09:19.478 --> 01:09:22.328
So, its a recored
failure love story.

01:09:22.526 --> 01:09:26.997
Whatever happened between us in real,
turned to be fictional would've been good

01:09:27.716 --> 01:09:30.118
Sorry Gautam.
Good Bye.

01:11:01.517 --> 01:11:03.376
Sameera...

01:11:03.376 --> 01:11:05.186
Is this real?
-What happened?

01:11:05.186 --> 01:11:07.226
Is this in real or not?
-Yes Gautam. So what?

01:11:07.226 --> 01:11:08.538
That means attack too is real.

01:11:09.693 --> 01:11:11.966
Gautam. Listen to me?

01:11:11.966 --> 01:11:15.139
You don't have any past.
You are just presumming that.

01:11:15.139 --> 01:11:18.607
As long as you don't believe that,
attacks on you keep on happening.

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:20.090
That is what I'm saying too.

01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:22.309
That attack was not
for me but for you.

01:11:24.166 --> 01:11:27.712
They are trying to kill you.
-So you are imagining like that now.

01:11:27.712 --> 01:11:29.546
Car accident, boat
accident, yatch attack...

01:11:29.546 --> 01:11:31.137
That too happened when
you where there...

01:11:31.137 --> 01:11:32.759
What they want is you not me.

01:11:32.759 --> 01:11:35.387
Why do they want to kill me?
I don't have any enemy.

01:11:35.387 --> 01:11:36.999
They woul've killed
me if they wanted to.

01:11:36.999 --> 01:11:38.497
They wouldn't have left me.

01:11:38.497 --> 01:11:40.129
They are coming for you Sameera.

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:41.967
Its not safe to stay here.
 Come.

01:11:42.342 --> 01:11:43.718
You know what?

01:11:43.718 --> 01:11:46.171
Real or Fictitious,
thats not your problem.

01:11:46.752 --> 01:11:48.639
Untrust.

01:11:48.996 --> 01:11:52.706
You'll have believed
me, if you'd loved me.

01:11:53.582 --> 01:11:55.100
I Love You.

01:11:56.032 --> 01:11:57.567
I Love You.

01:11:59.173 --> 01:12:01.025
Enough?

01:12:01.025 --> 01:12:02.509
Do you believe me now?

01:12:04.218 --> 01:12:07.210
I believe you Gautam.
I Love You too.

01:12:07.210 --> 01:12:08.222
Two minutes...

01:12:08.687 --> 01:12:10.284
I'll just change
my dress and come.

They are my friends.

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.017
Rahul, are you ok?

01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:40.811
Happy Birthday Sameera.

01:16:40.811 --> 01:16:45.134
We came to give you surprise
but Gautam gave us surprise.

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:55.468
I didn't thought they
were your friends.

01:16:55.468 --> 01:16:57.326
I thought they were
there to attack you.

01:16:57.369 --> 01:16:59.837
Sorry Sameera.
This won't repeat again.

01:17:00.092 --> 01:17:02.978
Sameera...
I'm saying Sorry.

01:17:04.906 --> 01:17:06.457
Happy Birthday Sammera.

01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:08.345
Please Gautam leave me.

01:17:09.901 --> 01:17:11.193
Just go away from here.

01:17:17.406 --> 01:17:19.517
What you said is
correct Sameera.

01:17:20.069 --> 01:17:22.924
Nobody attacked you.
All were my imaginations.

01:17:22.924 --> 01:17:26.418
Sameera...
I'll change...Sameera.

01:17:26.418 --> 01:17:29.675
Sameera... I'll change.

01:17:31.518 --> 01:17:33.862
Who cares if you change or not?

01:17:33.862 --> 01:17:35.365
Whats the relationship between us?

01:17:35.365 --> 01:17:36.185
Sameera I Love You.

01:17:38.603 --> 01:17:41.477
Is this the reality?
Do you know what you are saying real?

01:17:41.477 --> 01:17:42.379
Sameera... that is...

01:17:48.446 --> 01:17:50.809
I can't trust you Gautam.
You won't change.

01:17:50.904 --> 01:17:52.281
Stop Sameera.

01:17:52.281 --> 01:17:53.963
What should I say to
make you trust me?

01:17:53.963 --> 01:17:55.587
How can I make you believe me?

01:17:55.587 --> 01:17:58.155
Fine. Your past fictitious.
You don't have your parents.

01:17:58.155 --> 01:18:00.394
All is that your imagination.
Do you accept that?

01:18:06.025 --> 01:18:07.802
I accept that Sameera.

01:18:08.774 --> 01:18:12.122
I don't have my past nor
do I've my parents.

01:18:13.279 --> 01:18:15.758
If I don't come out now
from this falsity then

01:18:15.758 --> 01:18:17.800
I can't ever come out from this.

01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:21.924
In the sorrow of having no one,
I pressumed them to be killed.

01:18:21.924 --> 01:18:25.800
In the fear of losing you, I'm pressuming
someone trying to attack you right now too...

01:18:27.219 --> 01:18:28.857
That all is fictional.

01:18:28.857 --> 01:18:30.561
All is just created only by me.

01:18:39.192 --> 01:18:41.459
Gautam...

01:18:42.918 --> 01:18:47.210
Right now too, I'm imagining someone
trying to stab knife in your neck Sameera.

01:18:47.499 --> 01:18:49.715
Look I'm not reacting anymore.

01:18:49.715 --> 01:18:51.011
They are staring at me Sameera.

01:18:51.319 --> 01:18:53.446
There are other people
behind him too Sameera.

01:18:53.446 --> 01:18:55.212
I'm scared they might kill you.

01:18:55.212 --> 01:18:57.374
Look I'm not doing anything.
Believe me.

01:19:04.214 --> 01:19:05.684
Look they are
beating me Sameera.

01:19:05.684 --> 01:19:07.153
Yet I'm not doing anything.

01:20:05.982 --> 01:20:07.980
Whether its reality or not...

01:20:09.157 --> 01:20:11.242
I can't bear if anything
happens to you Sameera.

01:20:16.383 --> 01:20:18.205
Sorry Gautam...

01:20:27.654 --> 01:23:00.142
<b> <i>Ram</i> </b>

01:23:06.216 --> 01:23:07.404
Who are you?

01:23:08.058 --> 01:23:10.156
Why are you trying
to kill Sameera?

01:23:10.156 --> 01:23:12.288
Why are you trying to kill her?

01:23:12.288 --> 01:23:13.511
Tell me.

01:23:15.668 --> 01:23:16.963
Tell me.

01:23:18.287 --> 01:23:19.287
Tell me...

01:23:19.312 --> 01:23:21.180
Gautam...

01:23:21.875 --> 01:23:23.451
Leave him.

01:23:24.690 --> 01:23:26.358
I know who they are.

01:23:32.803 --> 01:23:35.121
What is that you urgently
want to talk with me?

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:37.032
Some one is trying
to kill me Sir.

01:23:37.032 --> 01:23:38.904
There are attacks
happening on me.

01:23:38.904 --> 01:23:40.213
Are you sure?
-Yes Sir.

01:23:40.554 --> 01:23:41.562
Do you remember that?

01:23:41.562 --> 01:23:47.807
2 months before I did a program to prove the
effects of seeds from A-Jeevan's company

01:23:47.813 --> 01:23:53.911
Actually my friends who proved Hydrogen
Cyanide in that seeds is a GOA's best INGOs active member.

01:23:53.911 --> 01:23:57.202
Recently when I called him when I
were in GOA but he didn't answer

01:23:57.202 --> 01:24:00.375
After that, it came to news that
he died in some boat accident.

01:24:00.375 --> 01:24:03.014
But before his death,
he'd called me

01:24:03.014 --> 01:24:07.593
Saying A-Jeevan cheif called him
to discuss about this matter.

01:24:07.593 --> 01:24:11.463
I'm the only one person to
know that he went there.

01:24:11.963 --> 01:24:16.047
When he died the day after
calling me, I got the doubt

01:24:16.047 --> 01:24:18.730
and inquired about the A-Jeevan chief.

01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:22.393
Correctly after that attacks
are happening on me.

01:24:22.393 --> 01:24:24.768
That means that's not
an accident Sir.

01:24:24.768 --> 01:24:26.064
It was a pre-plan murder Sir.

01:24:26.306 --> 01:24:30.969
Fearing about the truth coming
out, he too is trying to kill me.

01:24:33.925 --> 01:24:35.915
His name is Antonio Rosarios.

01:24:33.925 --> 01:24:35.567
Its his photo Sir.

01:24:35.567 --> 01:24:36.455
Have a look.

01:24:37.266 --> 01:24:38.955
Did anyone come with you?

01:24:38.955 --> 01:24:41.318
Gautam Sir. He is waiting
in the lobby outside.

01:24:42.025 --> 01:24:44.314
Do Gautam know this?
-No Sir.

01:24:44.314 --> 01:24:47.560
I thought informing you 1st as this
is related to the channel subjects.

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:54.211
I lied him saying that this is due to
the investigate that I did in the old city

01:25:03.725 --> 01:25:07.250
Don't tell... Not only
to Gautam but to anyone.

01:25:08.309 --> 01:25:09.658
What are you saying Sir?

01:25:11.056 --> 01:25:16.016
The same person Antonio Rosarios who
was a criminal in GOA

01:25:16.016 --> 01:25:19.357
Now he is a A-Jeevan Seeds
company's chief, mafia king

01:25:19.357 --> 01:25:20.882
5 minutes before, he came here.

01:25:21.463 --> 01:25:23.180
Armani Suit

01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:24.921
Ray ban glass

01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:26.130
Pony tail.

01:25:26.130 --> 01:25:27.968
cut in the face...

01:25:34.751 --> 01:25:36.007
Again he came.

01:25:36.007 --> 01:25:40.433
He is fearing that his political career
might get destroy because of this.

01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:44.863
Its for the news and reporter.
50 cores for me.

01:25:45.755 --> 01:25:47.628
He said he'll let you to live.

01:25:48.613 --> 01:25:50.301
what if I go against him?

01:25:51.627 --> 01:25:53.185
You'll die and I too will die.

01:25:55.185 --> 01:25:58.219
Seynore Seynoria
 ("How am I"? in Mongolian langugage)

01:26:01.847 --> 01:26:03.221
Are you shocked?

01:26:05.918 --> 01:26:07.793
This is the advantages
of pressuming.

01:26:08.297 --> 01:26:11.342
Every time you taking out the gun...
its becoming boring.

01:26:11.342 --> 01:26:12.767
Small change...

01:26:12.904 --> 01:26:14.264
How is it?

01:26:15.308 --> 01:26:16.354
Sit down.

01:26:19.158 --> 01:26:21.264
Right now I'm not pressumig
any chair for you.

01:26:21.264 --> 01:26:22.134
Sit down.

01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:26.946
Fictitious

01:26:27.311 --> 01:26:28.725
I know you are not in real.

01:26:30.818 --> 01:26:32.180
Sameera told me that.

01:26:33.255 --> 01:26:35.711
She proved that I
don't have any past.

01:26:35.711 --> 01:26:37.757
My past is falsity means you
too is not real, right?

01:26:37.757 --> 01:26:40.227
Shhhh... don't talk.
Stay calm.

01:26:40.794 --> 01:26:43.148
I'll believe you to
be real if you talk.

01:26:43.813 --> 01:26:45.311
I only talk.

01:26:49.403 --> 01:26:52.575
But Sameera don't like talking
with you in my imagination.

01:26:55.304 --> 01:26:57.663
She has started believing
me thinking I'm changing.

01:26:58.483 --> 01:27:01.238
For her to believe that I
totally has changed then

01:27:02.058 --> 01:27:04.063
I've to stop pressuming you.

01:27:04.116 --> 01:27:05.606
I've to kill you.

01:27:10.807 --> 01:27:13.356
Doctor gave me this tablets.

01:27:14.192 --> 01:27:16.353
Said you'll disappear
if I take this.

01:27:16.353 --> 01:27:17.778
that I won't see you again.

01:27:18.179 --> 01:27:22.076
But I feel pain if you dissappear.

01:27:22.076 --> 01:27:24.663
You are here means my
parents too were there.

01:27:24.663 --> 01:27:26.053
I'll have my past.

01:27:26.053 --> 01:27:27.914
If you are not then
I'll become orphan.

01:27:27.914 --> 01:27:30.244
It would've been good
if you were real.

01:27:30.725 --> 01:27:32.301
But you are not...

01:27:32.884 --> 01:27:33.942
Just die.

01:27:35.599 --> 01:27:38.650
You don't know why I'm
trying to kill you, right?

01:27:38.865 --> 01:27:40.600
Then I've to tell you my story.

01:27:42.908 --> 01:27:44.878
20 years back in GOA

01:27:45.272 --> 01:27:47.513
It says me with my parents
travelling in the bus.

01:27:47.943 --> 01:27:49.472
Story says three villians came.

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:51.002
One them, it says
you were the one.

01:27:51.422 --> 01:27:53.508
Says you killed my parents.

01:27:53.787 --> 01:27:55.007
Says I ran from there.

01:27:55.212 --> 01:27:57.476
Till then, story says you
have been trying to kill me

01:27:57.476 --> 01:28:00.678
Before I come and kill you, you
want to kill me, Says my story.

01:28:00.678 --> 01:28:01.868
This is my story.

01:28:02.934 --> 01:28:04.326
Revenge Story.

01:28:04.326 --> 01:28:05.434
How is it?

01:28:06.745 --> 01:28:08.481
This all is not
necessary for us.

01:28:09.234 --> 01:28:12.129
Doctor says, if take this tablets, you'll disapper.

01:28:12.477 --> 01:28:16.454
What I say is, before taking this tablets,
I want to kill you by this bullets.

01:28:16.454 --> 01:28:19.581
Revenge Story, Right? It would
get the commercial ending.

01:28:19.581 --> 01:28:20.677
What do you say?

01:28:25.761 --> 01:28:27.822
Why are you taking the breath?

01:28:28.006 --> 01:28:32.100
You are not alive coz you are breathing.
You are alive coz I'm imagining you.

01:28:34.718 --> 01:28:37.351
Ok. Last choice?
Do you want to say anything?

01:28:38.161 --> 01:28:40.783
Its ok, you can tell. I'm
giving you the permission.

01:28:40.783 --> 01:28:42.120
Tell me.

01:28:42.845 --> 01:28:44.004
I'm in real.

01:28:44.004 --> 01:28:45.567
I'm Real.

01:29:01.617 --> 01:29:04.156
That what I'm saying to everyone
but nobody is believing me.

01:29:04.156 --> 01:29:05.981
Anyway you believed
that you are Real.

01:29:10.378 --> 01:29:12.756
What happened?
I heard some sound.

01:29:12.756 --> 01:29:13.710
I Killed him.

01:29:14.584 --> 01:29:15.991
I killed that pony tail.

01:29:16.324 --> 01:29:17.992
Now he'll not dare
to come in my dream.

01:29:20.898 --> 01:29:22.746
Sond shouldn't have come?

01:29:38.398 --> 01:29:42.302
Is he in reality?
Sameera is he in reality?

01:29:43.996 --> 01:29:46.662
Is he in reality?
Sameera is he in reality?

01:29:57.592 --> 01:29:59.564
He is real Sameera.

01:29:59.564 --> 01:30:01.815
If he is real means
I've my past Sameera.

01:30:01.947 --> 01:30:03.941
I do had my parents Sameera.

01:30:03.941 --> 01:30:06.390
If he is real means remaining
two are also real Sameera.

01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:07.437
He knows me Sameera.

01:30:08.098 --> 01:30:09.355
Wake up...wake up...

01:30:09.355 --> 01:30:10.701
Who am I?

01:30:10.701 --> 01:30:11.948
Who are my mother and father?

01:30:11.948 --> 01:30:17.025
Why did you kill my parents?
Get up..get up...get up...

01:30:18.347 --> 01:30:20.718
Tell me...
He had told me he was real Sameera.

01:30:20.739 --> 01:30:22.046
Its me who didn't listen to him.

01:30:22.046 --> 01:30:24.100
who are the other two?
Wake up...

01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:25.260
WAKE UP...

01:30:30.256 --> 01:30:33.402
He died Sameera...
He didn't say anything to me Sammera.

01:30:33.402 --> 01:30:36.610
He died Sameera.
He died saying nothing Sameera.

01:30:36.610 --> 01:30:38.092
He died without saying
anything Sameera.

01:30:38.092 --> 01:30:39.791
I've killed him Sameera.

01:30:59.170 --> 01:31:00.615
What shall we do now?

01:31:00.615 --> 01:31:04.707
Now two of them are remaining. After catching
them, the reality of my past will come out.

01:31:04.707 --> 01:31:07.276
What if its a coincidence?
I mean...

01:31:09.257 --> 01:31:12.043
The one you imagined and
him might looked same...

01:31:12.043 --> 01:31:14.367
May be he has no
connection with your past.

01:31:14.367 --> 01:31:16.112
Those three killed my parents.

01:31:16.112 --> 01:31:18.673
He is one of them.
I know it.

01:31:18.673 --> 01:31:20.954
How can you say that?
We don't have any proofs.

01:31:20.954 --> 01:31:23.963
Do you remember the attack
before the night I went to Goa?

01:31:25.733 --> 01:31:27.073
Thats fictitious, right?

01:31:27.073 --> 01:31:29.298
From today onwards there won't be
any fictitious in my life Sameera.

01:31:29.298 --> 01:31:30.500
everything is real.

01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:33.432
The attacks is real.

01:31:34.591 --> 01:31:36.377
That day I took their photos.

01:32:36.054 --> 01:32:37.157
Got it.

01:32:42.696 --> 01:32:45.370
The photos are not clear.
Its difficult to identify them.

01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:48.022
Go back.

01:32:51.264 --> 01:32:52.536
Zoom at the cell phone.

01:32:54.176 --> 01:32:54.984
Zoom at the screen.

01:32:58.218 --> 01:32:59.888
May be exposal problem.

01:33:00.688 --> 01:33:02.185
Zoom it.

01:33:25.173 --> 01:33:26.909
Total how many photos are there?

01:33:27.331 --> 01:33:29.406
How many cell phone
photos are there?

01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:30.676
May be 12.

01:33:30.676 --> 01:33:31.863
Save it.

01:33:33.555 --> 01:33:35.031
Play them at a time.

01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:42.160
Play it again.

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:47.640
9..1...8...5...4

01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:51.566
6...4...8...5...7

01:33:52.439 --> 01:33:55.616
9185464857

01:34:02.706 --> 01:34:04.707
Pick up that phone.

01:34:22.018 --> 01:34:23.222
Hello...who are you?

01:34:23.222 --> 01:34:25.946
Thats what I'm
asking, "Who am I"?

01:34:34.482 --> 01:34:36.562
Who are my mother and father?

01:34:38.831 --> 01:34:40.456
Why did you killed them?

01:34:41.156 --> 01:34:43.672
What is the relations
between you and other two?

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:46.506
Who is that third one?

01:34:46.506 --> 01:34:47.831
Just listen to me?

01:34:47.831 --> 01:34:49.451
Why are you trying to kill me?

01:34:51.392 --> 01:34:53.070
Why are you trying to kill me?

01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:55.686
If we had come to kill you then,
we would've come silently.

01:34:59.106 --> 01:35:02.182
had we came to kill you, why
would we come empty handed...

01:35:02.182 --> 01:35:05.483
 we would've attacked you
not only got beaten.

01:35:05.897 --> 01:35:09.700
Yes Gautam. I sent
them to talk with you.

01:35:10.222 --> 01:35:14.243
They are not the goons, they
are my company's cab drivers.

01:35:15.331 --> 01:35:17.515
After seeing your
story in the TV

01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:19.955
I understood you looking
me too as villian.

01:35:19.955 --> 01:35:22.897
Thats why I sent them to
tell the truths about you.

01:35:22.897 --> 01:35:25.230
If you'd wanted that then
you'd had directly come.

01:35:25.230 --> 01:35:27.548
 I didn't came thinking
you'd react like this.

01:35:28.153 --> 01:35:30.583
One who wasn't there, you
killed imagining him.

01:35:30.583 --> 01:35:32.959
If I had come, thinking reality
you might have killed me.

01:35:33.975 --> 01:35:35.945
Anyway I did come
for you next day.

01:35:38.026 --> 01:35:40.047
But you left thinking
me as fictitious.

01:35:40.047 --> 01:35:42.571
Stop the car Gautam.

01:35:47.696 --> 01:35:49.598
20 years ago...

01:35:49.598 --> 01:35:51.602
I was a cab driver.

01:36:14.937 --> 01:36:17.210
Driver?
-Where do you want to go Sir?

01:36:17.210 --> 01:36:18.567
Follow that bus.

01:36:29.331 --> 01:36:31.785
Where are you from Sir?
-London.

01:36:33.397 --> 01:36:35.213
London is my dream Sir.

01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:38.343
Its said almost all cab drivers
Indian there, right Sir?

01:36:38.343 --> 01:36:42.479
I'm trying for the Visa. If you
help me then my life'll be settled.

01:36:42.479 --> 01:36:44.901
ok ok...lets see...
Follow the bus.

01:36:53.994 --> 01:36:57.681
Not you Sir. Your stop is yet to come.
Sit down Sir.

01:37:07.308 --> 01:37:09.480
I'll be waiting you
in the car Sir.

01:37:28.606 --> 01:37:33.964
Gautam run....

01:37:34.935 --> 01:37:37.109
Run Gautam...
Shot him.

01:37:43.374 --> 01:37:44.663
Kill that boy too.

01:38:06.006 --> 01:38:07.727
What happened Sir?

01:38:13.232 --> 01:38:14.903
Gautam...

01:38:24.492 --> 01:38:26.143
Don't leave him.

01:38:26.143 --> 01:38:28.831
Sir..Sir...don't kill him Sir.
He is just a kid Sir.

01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:33.662
Who are you son?

01:38:33.913 --> 01:38:35.048
Son

01:38:55.763 --> 01:38:57.475
Here...They killed
my mother here.

01:38:57.475 --> 01:38:58.899
Here...they killed
my father here.

01:38:59.923 --> 01:39:01.555
This boy is always
like that Sir.

01:39:01.555 --> 01:39:04.003
He immediately gets into
whatever the bus stops here.

01:39:04.003 --> 01:39:06.676
and says "here they killed
my mother and here father".

01:39:08.976 --> 01:39:11.433
Driver and Conductor
there, was intellegent.

01:39:11.433 --> 01:39:15.435
They asked both when we asked for
them what they want, money or life.

01:39:15.621 --> 01:39:16.743
So what about you?

01:39:24.185 --> 01:39:26.183
He too is intellegent.

01:40:42.991 --> 01:40:45.152
This is mine. My
mom gave me this.

01:40:45.152 --> 01:40:48.901
How many times do I've to say you that you don't
have your parents. You're just imagining them.

01:40:49.069 --> 01:40:50.169
Go from here.

01:40:50.256 --> 01:40:51.691
This boy is always like that Sir.

01:40:51.691 --> 01:40:53.777
He immediately gets into
whatever the bus stops here.

01:40:53.802 --> 01:40:56.943
and says "here they killed
my mother and here father".

01:40:56.943 --> 01:40:59.509
I've medical reports to prove
what you're saying is unreal.

01:40:59.509 --> 01:41:01.044
what do you have with you?

01:41:01.044 --> 01:41:03.291
why were you in the orphange
if you'd you parents?

01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:20.547
Don't cry. Your mother is not in the village.
She'll come soon.

01:41:20.933 --> 01:41:27.104
I want my mother.
-Don't cry. She'll come.

01:41:28.944 --> 01:41:30.144
Don't cry.

01:41:30.405 --> 01:41:31.747
What are you saying?

01:41:31.747 --> 01:41:34.038
He's crying for his mother.
What can I say for the kid.

01:41:35.387 --> 01:41:37.594
Don't tell lie to children.

01:41:37.594 --> 01:41:41.801
If you then, he'll end up like me trying
differentiating the truth and falsity.

01:41:43.221 --> 01:41:44.321
mother...

01:41:46.281 --> 01:41:48.893
What's your name dear?
-Chinna.

01:41:49.592 --> 01:41:52.754
Look at me Chinna.
Your mother is dead.

01:41:53.714 --> 01:41:55.157
She is gone forever.

01:41:57.645 --> 01:42:00.017
You've to live your whole
life believing this truth.

01:42:01.508 --> 01:42:03.714
Onwards you've to play
without your mom.

01:42:04.687 --> 01:42:06.494
you've to eat without your mom

01:42:07.001 --> 01:42:08.757
you've to grow on your own.

01:42:10.622 --> 01:42:12.025
sleep on your own.

01:42:12.025 --> 01:42:14.253
you've to do everything
without mom.

01:42:15.170 --> 01:42:16.294
mother...

01:42:18.505 --> 01:42:23.483
Mother...

01:42:26.788 --> 01:42:31.078
This is a belief that a
dying father gave to me.

01:42:32.002 --> 01:42:34.748
He wanted me to give
this to his son.

01:42:35.780 --> 01:42:39.017
I took it as my
resposibilit to handle you.

01:42:39.017 --> 01:42:40.670
Now I'm at peace.

01:42:55.028 --> 01:42:56.802
Its just a key.

01:42:57.474 --> 01:42:59.150
No any clues are here.

01:43:01.664 --> 01:43:06.524
British coin...

01:43:08.368 --> 01:43:10.285
Another is Rubik's cubes.

01:43:12.026 --> 01:43:13.994
I used to play with
this in my childhood.

01:43:13.994 --> 01:43:15.798
There is nothing
importance in this.

01:43:23.285 --> 01:43:25.634
Where are you Sir?

01:43:25.634 --> 01:43:27.853
I tried so many times
to contact you.

01:43:27.853 --> 01:43:29.452
Are you ok?
I need to talk about one thing.

01:43:29.452 --> 01:43:30.627
I'm coming to London.

01:43:31.356 --> 01:43:34.473
Why so suddenly?
Right now here is no any concert too.

01:43:34.473 --> 01:43:36.858
I'll come there and talk with you.
-Ok Gautam.

01:43:36.858 --> 01:43:38.054
Who is Michael?

01:43:38.054 --> 01:43:39.958
My concert manager of London.

01:43:40.676 --> 01:43:42.544
Whenever I go Lodon, he
used to take care of me.

01:43:43.216 --> 01:43:46.307
Looking at the coin of your father,
will you just go for London?

01:43:46.307 --> 01:43:49.098
I can't leave even a small things
that are related to my past.

01:43:49.098 --> 01:43:51.984
As per the cab driver, the third
one too came from London.

01:43:51.984 --> 01:43:53.381
He is there Sameera.

01:43:54.198 --> 01:43:55.652
I too will come with you.

01:43:57.490 --> 01:43:58.573
No Sameera.

01:43:58.573 --> 01:44:00.316
I can't loose you too.

01:44:03.371 --> 01:44:06.389
You are leaving me behind only because
of the love you've on me, right?

01:44:07.309 --> 01:44:11.863
Ok. Before you leave, I want
to kiss you as a remeberence.

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:18.326
I want to hug just once.

01:44:24.676 --> 01:44:26.204
Again one more hug.

01:44:30.585 --> 01:44:31.515
Thank you.

01:44:31.515 --> 01:44:32.995
What are you doing Sameera?

01:44:33.450 --> 01:44:35.100
I'm talking with you.

01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:38.925
You can imagine talking
with me but I can't. Right?

01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:41.435
Now onwards I've to live
without you, right?

01:44:41.435 --> 01:44:44.215
That's why I'm practicing
to imagine you.

01:44:47.570 --> 01:44:49.465
Come... Lets do again.

01:44:49.465 --> 01:44:50.840
I'll just hug once.

01:44:54.925 --> 01:44:56.425
Just again one kiss.

01:45:01.505 --> 01:45:03.100
Again one kiss.

I got in an important meeting.

01:48:28.568 --> 01:48:31.788
I've sent cab to the airport and
arranged everthing for you.

01:48:31.788 --> 01:48:34.598

Are you here for Gautam?
-It's me Madam.

01:48:47.453 --> 01:48:50.073
Why is there your name

01:48:50.073 --> 01:48:53.313
Madam, Gautam Sir is a Rockstar.
Anyone will recongise him.

01:48:53.313 --> 01:48:56.063
But Gautam Sir donot

01:48:56.063 --> 01:48:58.358
That's why I put my name.

Mam, where is Gautam Sir?

01:49:01.248 --> 01:49:02.363

Gautam Sir. Are you...???

01:49:18.828 --> 01:49:21.558
Its you. I can't believe this.

01:49:21.758 --> 01:49:23.353
Actually I'm your
songs crazy fan.

01:49:23.353 --> 01:49:25.568
I've been trying for you
autograph for so long time Boss.

01:49:25.568 --> 01:49:27.473
For that I came in your

01:49:27.473 --> 01:49:30.278
Are you here for concert?
We'll create sensation Boss.

01:49:30.278 --> 01:49:32.743
Actually to meet you is
my life time dream Boss.

01:49:38.358 --> 01:49:40.508
Where are you going Boss?
I'll drop you in my car.

01:49:40.598 --> 01:49:42.038
Please. Come with me Boss.

01:49:42.038 --> 01:49:43.523
Don't say anything Boss. Please.

01:49:43.523 --> 01:49:44.913
I won't get this chance again.

01:49:46.898 --> 01:49:48.723
Dudu...whose bag is in the lift?

01:49:48.723 --> 01:49:50.248
That's mine.
-Go then.

01:49:51.293 --> 01:49:52.183
Hey. My bag.

01:49:52.358 --> 01:49:53.203
Lets escape.

01:49:57.103 --> 01:50:00.208
Did you see that Mam?
How many Sir's fans are there in London.

01:50:00.208 --> 01:50:02.468
You're lucky madam. You
didn't see ladies fans there.

01:50:02.468 --> 01:50:05.118
If then, they would've bite
Sir's check like an apple.

01:50:06.028 --> 01:50:08.903
If you want to live then you've to
live like a star like our Sir, madam.

01:50:08.903 --> 01:50:11.393
Madam, its all coz of his
parents good deeds.

01:50:11.393 --> 01:50:13.718
They put guitar in our Sir's hand.

01:50:13.718 --> 01:50:15.288
But mine put stiring in my hands.

01:50:15.288 --> 01:50:18.498
That's why Dudu became
Rockstar and I ended as Rodstar.

01:50:19.478 --> 01:50:21.373
I just play with stiring.

01:50:21.403 --> 01:50:24.353
Hey Dad Mangal Singh,
I'll not forgive you.

01:50:24.353 --> 01:50:26.028
Gulab Singh, do uoy have FM?

01:50:26.603 --> 01:50:29.803
Madam, are you saying to shut up and drive?

01:50:29.803 --> 01:50:31.103
But impossible.

01:50:31.103 --> 01:50:33.608
Dudu always sing and I talk.

01:50:34.458 --> 01:50:36.743
where can I find guns here?
-Guns?

01:50:36.743 --> 01:50:41.068
I got it Dude. This time you're
using bullet sounds in the music.

01:50:47.573 --> 01:50:49.948

01:50:49.948 --> 01:50:52.238

Lets go away from here. Please Gautam.
Please.

They did right thing by
trying to kill me, Sameera.

It's now confirmed that
the third one is here.

01:52:44.577 --> 01:52:46.827
Till now I kept on
searching them.

01:52:47.157 --> 01:52:49.112
But now they are searching for me.

01:52:49.652 --> 01:52:51.707
We both are standing in
the same way.

01:52:51.707 --> 01:52:53.017
Face to face.

01:52:54.482 --> 01:52:55.952
I'll get him Sameera.

01:52:57.027 --> 01:53:00.032
Dudu. I called Michael
but is switched off.

01:53:00.032 --> 01:53:01.872
No any number is working Dudu.

01:53:06.777 --> 01:53:08.477
Whats the relation
between you and Michael?

01:53:08.477 --> 01:53:10.087
I don't have any
connection with him Dudu.

01:53:10.087 --> 01:53:12.852
He is just my regular cutomer.
Keep calling only for the cab.

01:53:12.852 --> 01:53:14.127
Do you know where is he?

01:53:14.127 --> 01:53:18.397
He is out of my connection.
I don't know where he went.

01:53:19.942 --> 01:53:22.142
That means do he have
connection with the attack?

01:53:22.187 --> 01:53:24.377
Only Michael know
that we came here.

01:53:25.907 --> 01:53:29.207
He didn't come to the airport.
Switched off the mobile after the attack.

01:53:29.207 --> 01:53:31.962
That means he and that third
guy has the connections.

01:53:32.262 --> 01:53:34.292
First we've to find Michael.

01:53:34.292 --> 01:53:37.832
I don't know where he is Dudu.
But I know where he goes.

02:01:52.504 --> 02:01:54.614
They've been hunting
me since my childhood.

02:01:56.944 --> 02:02:00.139
I keep on remembering them in the
fear that they might kill me.

02:02:00.734 --> 02:02:02.784
But I forgot how my
parents look like.

02:02:05.724 --> 02:02:07.584
I remember the touch
of my Mother

02:02:09.494 --> 02:02:10.509
I don't remember her.

02:02:12.624 --> 02:02:13.994
I remember the
Love of my Father.

02:02:16.399 --> 02:02:17.489
I don't remember him.

02:02:19.064 --> 02:02:22.139
I don't even remember their memory
having them with me in my past Sameera.

02:02:28.844 --> 02:02:30.179
I kept on trying.

02:02:31.284 --> 02:02:33.004
I kept on trying
since my childhood.

02:02:34.204 --> 02:02:36.739
When I'll get the murderers...
when will I kill them...

02:02:38.029 --> 02:02:42.019
I killed them.
But all that became fictional.

02:02:42.019 --> 02:02:45.064
That's not fictional Dudu.
You'll really kill them Dudu.

02:02:45.064 --> 02:02:47.354
You'll definitely know
about your parents.

02:02:47.889 --> 02:02:50.629
Dudu, though my parents
were always around me

02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:53.294
I'm that bloody who walked
without caring them.

02:02:53.749 --> 02:02:55.984
But, for the parents who you
don't even remember

02:02:55.984 --> 02:02:58.634
you're struggling so
much for them means...

02:02:59.124 --> 02:03:03.044
Its sure that you'll know your parents
and you'll surely revenge them.

02:03:03.044 --> 02:03:06.664
I became unable to catch
the one whom I found.

02:03:06.964 --> 02:03:09.394
Though I'm near to catch them but
feel I'm going far from that.

02:03:09.714 --> 02:03:11.064
I'm not finding anything.

02:03:18.879 --> 02:03:22.564

your father left you this means

02:03:23.059 --> 02:03:25.214

got some informations.

02:11:56.575 --> 02:11:58.010

What happened Dudu?
-Sameera is missing.

02:12:05.515 --> 02:12:06.915

02:12:13.250 --> 02:12:17.015
Oh that girl. You always used
to keep on talking to her.

02:12:17.015 --> 02:12:20.180
But you were always talking alone.
 Actually there is no any such girl.

02:12:20.315 --> 02:12:21.735
Do you know his girl friend?

02:12:22.330 --> 02:12:24.695
No Sir. He in reality doesn't
have any girl friend.

02:12:24.695 --> 02:12:25.460

02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:28.755
No girl friend Sir. But he

02:12:30.045 --> 02:12:31.295
Self talking Sir always.

02:12:31.245 --> 02:12:34.505

But there is no Sameera.

02:12:35.375 --> 02:12:37.540
Don't lie.

02:12:39.460 --> 02:12:42.940
That's why I ingored when you
kept talking yourself, Dudu.

02:12:42.940 --> 02:12:45.205
You were all alone
in airport, Dudu.

02:12:45.205 --> 02:12:47.235
Actually girl called Sammera
didn't came to London.

02:12:47.235 --> 02:12:49.295
Don't you know who is Sameera?

02:12:49.332 --> 02:12:51.302
Attack happened here.
They took Sameera.

02:12:51.302 --> 02:12:52.727

02:12:54.427 --> 02:12:56.332
It doesnot seems here like that.

02:12:56.707 --> 02:12:58.122
Everything is normal.

02:13:28.287 --> 02:13:30.397
My name is Naveen.

02:13:31.262 --> 02:13:32.897

Do you know who is he?

02:13:36.337 --> 02:13:37.827
What's the problem?

02:13:38.207 --> 02:13:40.282
He is a very famous
artist in India.

02:13:40.282 --> 02:13:42.082
People are so crazy about him.

02:13:42.102 --> 02:13:45.207
He is a Rockstar. If the Indians

airport that day.

02:14:08.764 --> 02:14:11.399
This is a big misunderstanding.
I've the proof officer.

02:14:11.399 --> 02:14:13.544
This is a picture, I
took at the airport.

02:14:13.544 --> 02:14:14.654

No inspector. He has many
chances to got release.

02:14:29.456 --> 02:14:34.431
What if we replaced your vehicle
with another brand new vehicle?

02:14:34.431 --> 02:14:37.338
That too beyond the security camera.

02:14:40.073 --> 02:14:41.493

Hi Dudu.
How are you?

02:15:12.233 --> 02:15:13.478

02:15:13.478 --> 02:15:16.128
Super safe.
She is right with me.

02:15:16.128 --> 02:15:18.128
She is taking the
photos of titanic.

02:15:18.458 --> 02:15:21.833
Dudu. Did our plan worked out?
Did anyone come there?

02:15:21.833 --> 02:15:23.942
Not only one but two came here.

02:15:27.507 --> 02:15:28.722
That means Sameera...

02:15:28.722 --> 02:15:30.172
I wantonly missed her.

02:15:40.982 --> 02:15:42.284
Who are you?

02:15:42.929 --> 02:15:45.204
How did you find me before
I knew where I was?

02:15:50.901 --> 02:15:52.321
You can't kill me.

02:15:52.321 --> 02:15:54.566
Because he wants me alive.

02:15:54.581 --> 02:15:56.131
I need him.
Drop your gun.

02:15:58.046 --> 02:15:59.131
Who are you?

02:16:00.066 --> 02:16:01.181
Who sent you?

02:16:03.807 --> 02:16:04.812

Get in the car Gautam.
Just wait one minute.

02:16:11.751 --> 02:16:12.744

02:16:22.269 --> 02:16:24.359
Who is he?
Tell me.

02:16:24.359 --> 02:16:25.621

I'll tell you Boss.

02:16:30.541 --> 02:16:31.866
No. Don't tell him.

02:16:31.866 --> 02:16:32.986
You'll die if you tell him.

02:16:49.716 --> 02:16:52.165
This is the place where
you can find your answer.

02:17:16.311 --> 02:17:18.790
I killed those three
who killed my parents.

02:18:10.725 --> 02:18:14.705
When everyone is chasing
you, why are you after me?

02:18:14.705 --> 02:18:15.674
What did I do...

02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:17.660
Gautam, what's this?

02:18:20.030 --> 02:18:21.320
Why did you killed my parents?

02:18:21.655 --> 02:18:23.219
20 years ago.
-What are you saying?

02:18:23.219 --> 02:18:23.809

02:18:23.809 --> 02:18:26.985
You were with other two.
Why did you killed?

02:18:35.645 --> 02:18:38.219
What Boss?
Do you remembered?

02:18:39.219 --> 02:18:42.260
Among the three murders you thought
to be fictional, one was Real.

02:18:44.504 --> 02:18:45.775
You killed him Boss.

02:18:46.870 --> 02:18:48.295
You really killed him.

02:18:49.385 --> 02:18:51.245
Do you know whom you killed?

02:18:52.500 --> 02:18:53.730
My father, Boss.

02:18:56.254 --> 02:18:57.549
My life Boss.

02:18:57.850 --> 02:18:59.645
My Father was my life Boss.

02:19:00.305 --> 02:19:02.655
I too is crazy about you.
About your song.

02:19:03.905 --> 02:19:06.395
Look at this Boss.
Look.

02:19:07.325 --> 02:19:09.895
I still kept your symbol with me
though I knew you killed my father.

02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:14.030
You killed such fan's father.

02:19:17.370 --> 02:19:20.117
That's why Boss, I
wanted to kill you.

02:19:20.117 --> 02:19:23.610
I came there in you Hyderbad concert
to kill you but got missed.

02:19:24.684 --> 02:19:25.994
Till then I searched you.

02:19:25.994 --> 02:19:28.041
Then I knew, you coming here.

02:19:29.410 --> 02:19:30.277
I followed you.

02:19:31.166 --> 02:19:34.066
I planned to kill you in bridge
when you were coming from airport.

02:19:34.879 --> 02:19:36.056
But again missed you.

02:19:36.056 --> 02:19:38.254
Today too I came in police
station to kill you

02:19:39.249 --> 02:19:40.465
Its paining Boss.

02:19:41.100 --> 02:19:43.719
Its paining that I might
die before killing you.

02:19:53.621 --> 02:19:54.496
Kill me.

02:19:55.271 --> 02:19:56.504
Kill me.
-Boss?

02:19:58.132 --> 02:20:00.252
I know the pain of
loosing parents.

02:20:01.077 --> 02:20:03.153
Whom I wanted to
kill, I killed them.

02:20:03.153 --> 02:20:05.046
My revenge is finished.

02:20:06.032 --> 02:20:07.360
Now remaining is yours revenge.

02:20:09.093 --> 02:20:10.715
But one thing before killing.

02:20:11.592 --> 02:20:14.555
Why did you kill Michael?
-Who is Michael, Boss?

02:20:15.868 --> 02:20:17.511
That means you
didn't kill Michael?

02:20:17.511 --> 02:20:19.226
Why do I kill him?

02:20:20.430 --> 02:20:22.336
That means you
didn't come to bank?

02:20:23.713 --> 02:20:25.239
That means you don't
want the box?

02:21:00.336 --> 02:21:01.237
Pick up the phone.

02:21:06.850 --> 02:21:09.385
20 years back, what's your
father's occupation in Goa?

02:21:10.688 --> 02:21:12.060
Taxi driver.

02:21:28.352 --> 02:21:29.925
Where are you from Sir?
-London.

02:21:32.730 --> 02:21:33.978
London is my dream Sir.

02:21:35.426 --> 02:21:36.380
Follow that bus.
Ok Sir.

02:21:42.359 --> 02:21:44.230
Kill him too.

02:22:01.109 --> 02:22:02.147
Don't kill him Sir.

02:22:02.147 --> 02:22:03.938
he is just a kid.

02:22:12.123 --> 02:22:14.473
You need Visa.
You need Vis, right?

02:22:14.964 --> 02:22:16.671
He wants Visa, right?

02:22:33.930 --> 02:22:36.018
Who told you that I
killed your father?

02:22:37.647 --> 02:22:39.994
That day in the concert, my
father met his old friend.

02:22:40.410 --> 02:22:42.844
You are always my boss.
Come Sir.

02:22:49.208 --> 02:22:51.374
He too was in the car when
you followed my father.

02:22:51.723 --> 02:22:53.613
I started a new bussiness.

02:22:53.613 --> 02:22:55.566
He saw you creating
trouble with my father.

02:22:55.566 --> 02:22:58.790
20 years back. In Goa.
You were with other two.

02:22:58.790 --> 02:23:01.234
He said that you killed my father.

02:23:03.062 --> 02:23:03.911
Why you killed them?

02:23:06.063 --> 02:23:09.536
I'm not the one who killed your father.
your father's old friend.

02:23:24.603 --> 02:23:28.459
Due to the SINTO-1 company,
sides effects are seen

02:23:28.459 --> 02:23:31.146
Land is polluting and many are dying.

02:23:31.146 --> 02:23:32.506
This is not the problem.

02:23:33.516 --> 02:23:36.158
Climate temperature
is increasing.

02:23:36.158 --> 02:23:38.214
Fertile lands are
turning to infertile.

02:23:38.214 --> 02:23:41.402
In many countries there
is the scarcity of foods.

02:23:42.271 --> 02:23:45.563
World is going to face a
big food crisis problems.

02:24:05.832 --> 02:24:07.693
Golden rice with C4 mechanism.

02:24:10.914 --> 02:24:14.248
whatever the climate,
it can grow massively.

02:24:14.714 --> 02:24:16.974
The property that can
fullfill the world's need.

02:24:21.902 --> 02:24:26.370
That property is
invented by SINTO-1.

02:24:34.867 --> 02:24:38.037
From now onwards, every types of
countries(rich or poor,having food crisis)

02:24:38.037 --> 02:24:41.018
 have to beg before
SINTO-1 for the food.

02:25:03.285 --> 02:25:04.874
Sir, Gautam knew the truth.

02:25:11.370 --> 02:25:45.169
<i><b>RAM</b></i>

02:25:48.482 --> 02:25:51.884
He can't kill me nither do I.

02:25:56.093 --> 02:25:59.941
My Golden rice is with him
and I've his past with me.

02:26:02.454 --> 02:26:04.095
We need eachother.

02:26:10.192 --> 02:26:12.533
Your father and I was
Co-Scientists in same company.

02:26:12.533 --> 02:26:14.548
Not only that but
a good friends.

02:26:14.548 --> 02:26:19.380
Your father always used to think about
the welfare of peoples and farmers

02:26:19.380 --> 02:26:21.702
He wanted to do
something for them.

02:26:21.991 --> 02:26:26.658
After that we started this
SINTO-1 seeds hybrid company.

02:26:26.658 --> 02:26:32.774
But your father involved in preparing
golden seed in a traditional way.

02:26:32.774 --> 02:26:34.370
which I said impossible.

02:26:34.370 --> 02:26:37.873
Suddenly he came to the
lab to test the seeds.

02:26:37.873 --> 02:26:40.122
I got surprised
seeing the results.

02:26:40.122 --> 02:26:41.725
That was Golden Rice.

02:26:41.725 --> 02:26:48.200
Cores and cores of money was invested in the project
whose result was in you father's hand.

02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:50.720
I said him to give
it for the company.

02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:52.968
He said no and wanted
to give people freely.

02:26:53.696 --> 02:26:56.741
For that he went to the Goa
International Rice Convention.

02:26:57.570 --> 02:27:00.746
I thought of getting seeds
killing your father.

02:27:01.709 --> 02:27:03.914
Joining Antonio there,
I killed your parents.

02:27:04.999 --> 02:27:09.247
After that I found, the seeds your
father gave me was of no use.

02:27:11.586 --> 02:27:14.789
There he put the
terminator gene.

02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:17.622
We got the information that
he hided seeds somewhere

02:27:17.622 --> 02:27:21.514
and put its locations secretly in the Rubik's cube from the cab driver.

02:27:21.779 --> 02:27:23.829
your father wants you to
have that Rubik's means

02:27:23.829 --> 02:27:25.970
you know about finding the clue.

02:27:25.970 --> 02:27:27.790
I sent my people behind you.

02:27:27.790 --> 02:27:29.790
But you were too clever.
You ran from there.

02:27:34.213 --> 02:27:38.728
The magic that father hided 20
years back, now son has got that.

02:27:38.913 --> 02:27:42.146
I got doubt when the bullet that killed
Michael didn't wanted to kill me

02:27:42.146 --> 02:27:45.313
the one whom I'm searching is
expecting something from me.

02:27:45.338 --> 02:27:47.572
At that time I got the
clue and went to bank.

02:27:48.023 --> 02:27:50.242
In bank, I found the box
that my father hided.

02:27:51.328 --> 02:27:52.872
But there was no
seed in the box.

02:27:53.871 --> 02:27:55.792
Whats that there is
no seed in the box?

02:27:55.792 --> 02:27:56.732
There must be seed.

02:27:56.775 --> 02:27:59.848
There should also be the
details of my father in your story.

02:28:04.660 --> 02:28:08.013
I know that you are eagarly waiting
to know about your parents.

02:28:11.629 --> 02:28:13.091
Your father's name is Raghu Ram.

02:28:36.324 --> 02:28:38.423
This is not original
golden rice.

02:28:38.423 --> 02:28:40.298
My father name is
also not Raghu Ram.

02:28:40.298 --> 02:28:41.456
How can you say that?

02:28:54.667 --> 02:28:59.848
You won't kill me untill and unless I
say the truths about your parents.

02:29:02.279 --> 02:29:03.763
That means that
file is not real.

02:29:12.797 --> 02:29:14.186
Tell me where is seed?

02:29:14.186 --> 02:29:16.460
I'll tell truths
about your parents.

02:29:21.991 --> 02:29:23.454
Finally what I understood is

02:29:24.833 --> 02:29:26.820
you won't tell me until
I give you the seed.

02:29:27.906 --> 02:29:30.276
I won't give you seed until
you tell me about my parents.

02:29:31.529 --> 02:29:33.805
The other truth that
you and I know is

02:29:33.805 --> 02:29:36.490
As soon as I give you
seed, you'll kill me.

02:29:37.436 --> 02:29:40.036
I too will kill you as soon
as you tell me the truths.

02:29:41.187 --> 02:29:42.375
Never Ending Process.

02:29:43.556 --> 02:29:45.452
There is only one
solution for this

02:29:45.477 --> 02:29:47.525
one of us has to compromise.

02:29:48.438 --> 02:29:49.887
I'll compromise.

02:29:50.714 --> 02:29:52.035
I don't need my past.

02:29:54.016 --> 02:29:55.769
Means?
-I'll kill you.

02:30:29.721 --> 02:30:32.177
Gautam

02:30:32.177 --> 02:30:35.137
I'm the only one to know
about your parents.

02:30:35.137 --> 02:30:38.604
If you kill me then there
won't be your any past.

02:30:38.604 --> 02:30:41.828
If I don't kill you then my
fathers wish will not come true.

02:30:41.828 --> 02:30:45.211
Till now I thought knowing
my parents was my life

02:30:45.211 --> 02:30:48.357
Now I decided to fulfill my
fathers wish is correct for me.

02:30:53.543 --> 02:30:55.086
Your father's name
is Krishna Murthy.

02:30:55.086 --> 02:30:56.478
He is a Scientist
from Philipines.

02:30:56.743 --> 02:31:01.169
Ravindra.
Your father's name is Ravindra.

02:31:01.194 --> 02:31:02.938
He used to work in Texas.

02:31:09.277 --> 02:31:10.289
not Krishna Murthy.

02:31:12.805 --> 02:31:15.132
I'l listen whatever
the stories you tell.

02:31:16.006 --> 02:31:18.453
Coz in there is my parents
in every stories.

02:31:19.791 --> 02:31:21.476
You'd killed him in every story.

02:31:22.959 --> 02:31:24.733
The end of story is always same

02:31:25.230 --> 02:31:26.303
that I'll kill you.

02:31:32.393 --> 02:31:33.751
You won't kill me.

02:31:33.751 --> 02:31:38.727
If you wanted then you'll
shot here and not in other places.

02:31:40.096 --> 02:31:41.347
You won't me.

02:31:41.347 --> 02:31:44.990
you want your past about your parents.
You won't kill me.

02:31:45.753 --> 02:31:47.863
Its not new for me to kill you.

02:31:47.863 --> 02:31:49.552
I have killed you many times.

02:31:50.378 --> 02:31:52.391
I know what happens
when you die.

02:31:53.220 --> 02:31:55.451
But you don't know what
happens when I kill you.

02:32:04.728 --> 02:32:05.452
That's true.

02:32:06.807 --> 02:32:08.085
What you said is correct.

02:32:09.212 --> 02:32:10.293
I can't kill you.

02:32:13.421 --> 02:32:14.981
I want my parents.

02:32:16.734 --> 02:32:18.103
I want to know who they are.

02:32:19.443 --> 02:32:21.556
I just remember my
mother feeding me.

02:32:25.229 --> 02:32:27.229
I remember sitting
in my fathers lap.

02:32:30.154 --> 02:32:31.983
Suddenly they said
I had no parents.

02:32:32.956 --> 02:32:33.835
All was fictitious.

02:32:34.945 --> 02:32:35.604
I cried.

02:32:37.034 --> 02:32:38.366
Till now I kept on crying.

02:32:45.612 --> 02:32:47.654
Tell me who were my parents.

02:32:48.062 --> 02:32:49.705
At least tell me how they look?

02:32:51.021 --> 02:32:52.279
How does my mother looked like?

02:32:53.748 --> 02:32:55.219
How does my father looked like?

02:32:55.319 --> 02:32:56.468
Do he looked like me?

02:32:56.794 --> 02:32:57.813
You had seen them, right?

02:32:58.419 --> 02:32:59.369
Tell me please.

02:32:59.995 --> 02:33:01.277
Tell me something please.

02:33:02.798 --> 02:33:03.991
Ok.
I'll tell.

02:33:05.203 --> 02:33:07.188
First lets go to hospital, ok?

02:33:09.841 --> 02:33:11.630
I'm dying.

02:33:11.630 --> 02:33:14.684
You'll always be keep
on crying if I die.

02:33:15.468 --> 02:33:19.230
I'll tell every damn thing.

02:33:19.230 --> 02:33:20.366
Every damn thing.

02:33:20.943 --> 02:33:23.827
Where is... Golden Rice?

02:33:24.343 --> 02:33:25.127
Where is it?

02:33:45.843 --> 02:33:47.235
I'm sorry for everything Boss.

02:33:48.731 --> 02:33:49.874
You are the ONE.

02:33:51.555 --> 02:33:53.148
You'll always be ONE for me.

02:34:21.735 --> 02:34:24.074
Sorry Dudu.
I've only one pain.

02:34:24.714 --> 02:34:27.578
You are returning without
knowing your parents.

02:34:28.377 --> 02:34:30.717
It would be good if
you'd known them.

02:35:01.720 --> 02:35:02.706
Stop the car.

02:36:13.944 --> 02:36:16.312
What dear?
Do you forgot the way to your house?

02:36:16.312 --> 02:36:18.543
I'll sing you a song for you.

02:36:18.543 --> 02:36:20.291
Then you won't forget your way.

02:36:20.291 --> 02:36:20.851
Ok?

02:37:16.076 --> 02:37:22.847
Bye bye bye to the
Peter's statue.

02:37:28.213 --> 02:37:34.850
Hi to the white
swan in the river.

02:37:40.840 --> 02:37:44.106
There's the road in
between the trees.

02:37:44.106 --> 02:37:48.106
Run Run Run

02:37:57.014 --> 02:38:00.167
In the field, there's tower.

02:38:00.167 --> 02:38:02.587
Its so high.

02:38:05.566 --> 02:38:08.328
There's a bridge in the way.

02:38:08.328 --> 02:38:11.618
Fly Fly Fly

02:38:12.672 --> 02:38:16.674
Then comes beautiful fields.

02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:05.337
Gautam?
-I'm coming father

02:40:14.751 --> 02:40:16.483
Gautam?
-Coming.

02:42:34.909 --> 02:42:35.734
We are civilized.

02:42:36.334 --> 02:42:37.634
We are mordernized.

02:42:37.634 --> 02:42:38.710
We are globalized.

02:42:39.754 --> 02:42:41.149
Civilization is a great failure.

02:42:41.989 --> 02:42:43.339
People dying of hunger.

02:42:43.339 --> 02:42:46.039
Every 3 of seconds, human
being is dying of hunger.

02:42:47.124 --> 02:42:49.304
A man thought no one
should die of hunger.

02:42:50.939 --> 02:42:54.839
He was not a farmer, not a
biologist and not a scientist.

02:42:55.784 --> 02:42:58.144
In the desire to fulfilling
the hunger of every people

02:42:58.144 --> 02:43:01.469
It made him a biologist, a
farmer and a scientist.

02:43:02.339 --> 02:43:04.664
At every cost of
fullfilling his wish

02:43:04.664 --> 02:43:06.574
He kept on trying continuously.

02:43:06.574 --> 02:43:09.274
On the verge of trying,
he lost his life.

02:43:10.394 --> 02:43:12.199
But he achieved what
he has dreamed for.

02:43:14.614 --> 02:43:15.724
The Golden Rice.

02:43:16.804 --> 02:43:18.354
A Second Green Revolution.

02:43:19.184 --> 02:43:21.189
From now onwards, no people
will die of hunger.

02:43:22.279 --> 02:43:23.839
Today his dream is fulfilled.

02:43:26.519 --> 02:43:27.869
