00:12.412 --> 00:15.313
Gedrin! Gedrin!

00:24.724 --> 00:25.656
What happened?

00:25.725 --> 00:26.657
l lost you.

00:26.726 --> 00:28.694
37 bio- pods were damaged.

00:28.762 --> 00:32.061
l had to disconnect them
from the reactor.

00:32.131 --> 00:33.292
Were they dead?

00:33.366 --> 00:34.458
l had no choice.

00:41.741 --> 00:43.265
The main power's holding.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.742
The rest of the bio- pods
are secure,

00:45.812 --> 00:47.973
and that leaves us.

00:50.417 --> 00:51.543
Don't look so worried.

00:51.618 --> 00:53.017
lt'll be like
a simple night's sleep.

00:55.422 --> 00:57.014
We're out of time.

00:57.090 --> 00:59.024
Do you think we'll dream?

00:59.092 --> 01:00.320
l don't know.

01:02.629 --> 01:04.062
We'll get through this.

01:04.129 --> 01:06.155
What if there's nothing left?

01:06.232 --> 01:08.462
We'll start again.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.799
Five years.

03:23.436 --> 03:24.596
Report.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.535
We've entered some kind
of a subspace corridor.

03:26.606 --> 03:29.074
We were cruising
at warp 6, then, wham.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.940
This thing pulled at our
warp field like a magnet.

03:32.011 --> 03:34.138
Where did that debris come from?

03:34.214 --> 03:36.148
Unknown, but the corridor
is filled with it.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.743
Metal fragments,
plasma exhaust, organic residue.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.946
Some of the debris
is over 800 years old, Captain.

03:42.021 --> 03:43.181
l'd like to avoid

03:43.256 --> 03:45.156
becoming part
of this garbage stream.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.419
Can you find a way out?

03:46.492 --> 03:47.424
l don't know.

03:47.493 --> 03:48.551
There's hundreds of corridors.

03:48.628 --> 03:49.822
lt's like a maze.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.262
Well, be a good rat
and find us the cheese, hmm?

03:52.332 --> 03:54.300
l'll do my best, Captain.

03:57.303 --> 03:58.429
Tuvok?

03:58.538 --> 04:00.403
lt was a vessel, sir.

04:00.473 --> 04:01.531
They are hailing us.

04:01.641 --> 04:02.608
Put it through.

04:05.345 --> 04:07.279
Who are you?

04:07.347 --> 04:09.611
l'm Captain Kathryn Janeway
of the Starship Voyager

04:09.682 --> 04:10.808
and you are...?

04:10.883 --> 04:13.283
This under- space belongs to us.

04:13.353 --> 04:14.411
We're here by accident.

04:14.487 --> 04:16.011
We're trying to find a way out.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.021
Can you help us?

04:17.089 --> 04:18.250
Help you?

04:18.324 --> 04:21.088
Yes. We'll help you.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.692
They are targeting
our shields

04:24.764 --> 04:25.788
with a resonance pulse.

04:25.865 --> 04:27.162
lt's altering the harmonics.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.030
We're being pushed
out of the corridor.

04:34.207 --> 04:35.469
We're clear.

04:35.541 --> 04:38.009
The vessel has exited
the corridor as well.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.239
Captain, we're over 200
light- years from where

04:41.314 --> 04:42.713
we entered the corridor.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.841
200 light- years in five minutes?

04:44.917 --> 04:46.384
Hail them.

04:46.452 --> 04:49.046
Thank you for your help.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.680
There's something
l'd like to ask you.

04:50.757 --> 04:52.281
We've got
a long journey ahead of us,

04:52.358 --> 04:53.916
and l was wondering
if we could negotiate

04:53.993 --> 04:55.756
passage through
this under- space of yours.

04:55.828 --> 04:56.795
Lower your shields.

04:56.863 --> 04:57.955
Prepare to be boarded.

04:58.097 --> 05:00.190
Boarded? For what reason?

05:00.266 --> 05:01.733
We must purge your computer.

05:01.834 --> 05:04.667
Remove all readings you've
gathered in our territory.

05:04.737 --> 05:05.931
We pose no threat to you.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.301
We're simply trying to...

05:07.373 --> 05:10.069
We're going to destroy
that information

05:10.143 --> 05:11.474
one way or another.

05:11.544 --> 05:12.875
Lower your shields.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.344
l won't do that.

05:19.385 --> 05:20.647
Evasive maneuvers.

05:20.720 --> 05:21.846
Try to disable them.

05:21.921 --> 05:24.116
Their vessel is
highly maneuverable.

05:24.190 --> 05:26.385
lt's difficult to get
a phaser lock.

05:26.459 --> 05:28.290
Picking up two more ships
heading our way.

05:28.361 --> 05:31.728
Direct hit.
Our warp drive is off- line.

05:32.799 --> 05:35.324
Shields down to 82 percent.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.196
60 percent.

05:37.303 --> 05:38.270
They're closing.

05:38.371 --> 05:39.838
We could use
some clever suggestions

05:39.939 --> 05:40.871
about now.

05:40.940 --> 05:43.238
There's a planet
eight million kilometers ahead- -

05:43.309 --> 05:44.640
uninhabited- - 
but the atmosphere

05:44.711 --> 05:46.303
is charged
with radiogenic particles.

05:46.379 --> 05:47.573
How radiogenic?

05:47.647 --> 05:50.047
3,000 isorems.

05:50.116 --> 05:51.606
lf we route enough power
to the shields,

05:51.684 --> 05:54.152
we can survive in that,
but maybe our friends can't.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.118
Shields at 53 percent.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.919
Do it.

06:05.565 --> 06:07.089
Entering the thermosphere.

06:07.166 --> 06:10.101
Radiation levels at 3,000
isorems and climbing.

06:10.169 --> 06:11.693
The alien ships?

06:11.804 --> 06:14.102
ln pursuit and charging weapons.

06:14.173 --> 06:15.606
lncrease our descent vector.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.408
They're still closing.

06:22.181 --> 06:23.876
Direct hit to our aft shields.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.713
Find the highest
concentration of radiation,

06:25.785 --> 06:26.717
and take us through it.

06:26.786 --> 06:30.882
Proximity radiation
at 4,000 isorems...

06:30.957 --> 06:32.322
5,000...

06:32.392 --> 06:34.622
Six.

06:34.694 --> 06:36.491
Their shields are weakening.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.893
They're breaking off.

06:37.997 --> 06:39.123
Now... all we need

06:39.198 --> 06:41.894
is a place to set down
and make repairs. Tom?

06:42.034 --> 06:44.366
We're clearing
the lower stratosphere.

06:44.470 --> 06:46.301
On screen.

06:50.009 --> 06:52.569
l thought you said
this planet was uninhabited.

06:52.645 --> 06:55.546
The radiation must have
interfered with my scans.

06:55.615 --> 06:56.877
l doubt it's inhabited anymore.

06:56.949 --> 06:57.938
Looks like this planet's

06:58.017 --> 06:59.416
in the middle
of a nuclear winter.

06:59.485 --> 07:02.682
Agreed. Gamma radiation levels
are highly toxic.

07:02.755 --> 07:06.191
The impact crater suggests
an orbital bombardment.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.954
How long ago?

07:08.027 --> 07:11.121
From the rate of radiogenic
decay... 892 years.

07:11.197 --> 07:14.496
This must have been
a city of millions.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.760
Set us down.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.210
Disengaging engines.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.879
Stand down Red Alert.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.389
Assign damage repair teams,
and, Tom, make sure B'Elanna

07:38.458 --> 07:39.789
has enough help in Engineering.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.554
l want those warp
engines back on line.

07:41.627 --> 07:42.719
Yes, ma'am.

07:42.795 --> 07:45.195
Our ''friends''
are still in orbit.

07:45.264 --> 07:46.288
Circling like vultures.

07:46.365 --> 07:47.730
Well, they're going
to go hungry.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.427
Not if they find a way
to adapt their shields

07:49.535 --> 07:50.433
and come down after us.

07:50.536 --> 07:52.401
Captain... l'm detecting
faint life signs

07:52.472 --> 07:53.530
coming from a chamber

07:53.639 --> 07:55.903
several hundred meters
beneath the surface.

07:55.975 --> 07:56.907
Survivors.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.466
After 900 years?

07:59.812 --> 08:01.837
Oversee the repair teams.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.381
You're going down there.

08:03.416 --> 08:04.974
lf somebody survived
this catastrophe,

08:05.051 --> 08:06.177
they might need our help.

08:06.252 --> 08:07.685
Get a good fix
on those coordinates.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.345
l don't want to beam
into solid rock.

08:09.422 --> 08:10.514
Seven, Tuvok, you're with me.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.875
These walls have been reinforced
with tritonium.

08:30.977 --> 08:32.910
They built this place to last.

08:42.955 --> 08:45.583
Most of the power relays
are still active.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.558
Not bad after nine centuries.

08:47.627 --> 08:49.891
The main reactor
is drawing energy

08:49.962 --> 08:52.226
from the planet's
geothermal core.

08:52.298 --> 08:53.788
Efficient.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.588
Some kind of stasis pod.

09:23.696 --> 09:24.958
This display indicates

09:25.031 --> 09:28.091
that there are more chambers
behind these walls.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.758
Some of them have failed.

09:29.869 --> 09:31.632
lt's amazing
they survived at all.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.568
Let's see what else we can find.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.361
Seven?

10:04.470 --> 10:05.596
What are you doing?

10:05.705 --> 10:08.333
l've activated
the reanimation sequence.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.410
He may be able
to provide us with answers.

10:11.477 --> 10:13.411
We don't know anything
about this species.

10:13.479 --> 10:14.503
They could be hostile.

10:14.580 --> 10:16.741
Most humanoid cultures are.

10:16.816 --> 10:20.308
Remind me to reacquaint you
with away mission protocols.

10:31.364 --> 10:32.296
Who?

10:32.365 --> 10:33.662
lt's all right.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.200
We're not your enemy.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.825
We're from a starship.

10:36.936 --> 10:39.905
We discovered this chamber
and revived you.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.702
How long was l...?

10:42.775 --> 10:44.675
ln stasis?

10:44.744 --> 10:46.678
Close to 900 years.

10:48.547 --> 10:51.516
900?

10:51.584 --> 10:54.018
Jisa.

10:54.086 --> 10:57.021
Help her, please.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.365
No, Jisa.

11:18.811 --> 11:20.972
She was my wife.

11:37.263 --> 11:39.094
l won't hurt you.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.660
l was drifting in and
out of consciousness

11:44.770 --> 11:45.930
when they brought me here,

11:46.038 --> 11:48.370
but l thought l saw you
appear out of thin air.

11:48.441 --> 11:52.571
l'm a computer program,
a hologram.

11:54.513 --> 11:56.003
And the others?

11:56.082 --> 11:58.482
Flesh and blood, like yourself.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.718
You're the ones
that took me out of stasis.

12:03.789 --> 12:05.450
l don't recognize
your species.

12:05.524 --> 12:09.290
Human. Our home planet
is halfway across the galaxy.

12:09.361 --> 12:11.352
And you've expanded
your territory

12:11.430 --> 12:12.397
into this space?

12:12.465 --> 12:15.525
Our ship was
brought here by accident.

12:15.634 --> 12:17.101
We're trying to get home.

12:17.169 --> 12:19.399
You're Borg.

12:19.505 --> 12:20.699
How do you know that?

12:20.806 --> 12:24.674
Don't you recognize
my people, the Vaadwaur?

12:24.744 --> 12:26.109
The collective's memory

12:26.178 --> 12:28.169
from 900 years ago
is fragmentary.

12:28.247 --> 12:31.944
l've had many encounters
with your kind.

12:32.051 --> 12:33.712
And lived to tell about them?

12:33.786 --> 12:35.083
lmpressive.

12:35.154 --> 12:37.816
How did you find us?

12:37.890 --> 12:40.450
We needed someplace
to hide from the Turei,

12:40.526 --> 12:43.962
after they found us in one
of their subspace corridors.

12:44.063 --> 12:45.758
Their corridors?

12:45.831 --> 12:46.798
So they claimed.

12:46.866 --> 12:47.924
The corridors were ours.

12:48.033 --> 12:49.625
lt took centuries to map them.

12:49.735 --> 12:51.760
We were the envy
of a hundred species

12:51.871 --> 12:52.963
including the Turei.

12:53.072 --> 12:54.061
Are they responsible

12:54.173 --> 12:55.470
for what happened
to your planet?

12:55.541 --> 12:57.168
The Turei and a dozen others.

12:57.243 --> 13:00.178
What one couldn't accomplish,
the others finally did.

13:03.749 --> 13:09.881
l... would like to look
at what's left of my world.

13:09.989 --> 13:13.288
We made our final stand there.

13:13.359 --> 13:14.758
l've scanned the caverns.

13:14.827 --> 13:17.660
You've got a thousand more
stasis pods down there- -

13:17.730 --> 13:19.857
most of them still active.

13:19.932 --> 13:24.562
Hundreds of ships,
land vehicles... weapons.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.137
A single battalion
and their families.

13:26.238 --> 13:28.900
We had planned to come out
of stasis after five years.

13:29.074 --> 13:31.872
We believed that by then,
the alliance would have been

13:31.944 --> 13:32.911
at each other's throats.

13:33.045 --> 13:34.307
You were going to rebuild?

13:34.380 --> 13:35.711
No, not here.

13:35.781 --> 13:38.409
We knew this planet would
be poisoned for centuries.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.918
We were planning
to go to another world,

13:40.986 --> 13:43.454
start a colony,
hope to find new allies,

13:43.522 --> 13:45.285
learn from them.

13:45.357 --> 13:47.086
Your power core is
still functioning.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.888
lt was the controls
that were damaged

13:48.961 --> 13:49.950
in the attack.

13:50.095 --> 13:52.359
That's why you never
came out of stasis.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.922
Jisa and l lived there
in the old quarter.

13:55.034 --> 13:57.662
We had a garden
overlooking the street below.

13:57.770 --> 14:01.103
lt's a shame she didn't show
more courage at the end.

14:01.173 --> 14:04.472
Given the circumstances...

14:04.543 --> 14:06.704
Well, that's no excuse.

14:06.779 --> 14:10.510
Pardon me for saying this,
but that seems a bit heartless.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.882
When it rains, do you run
from doorway to doorway,

14:13.986 --> 14:17.012
trying to stay dry
getting wet all the while,

14:17.089 --> 14:20.490
or do you just accept
the fact that it's raining

14:20.559 --> 14:22.026
and walk with dignity?

14:22.094 --> 14:23.026
Rain's one thing.

14:23.095 --> 14:24.824
Plasma bombs are something else.

14:24.897 --> 14:26.762
But the principle is the same.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.397
l'd bring an umbrella.

14:34.306 --> 14:35.864
Maybe it's not too late

14:35.975 --> 14:39.206
to meet a new ally
and learn from her.

14:39.278 --> 14:41.940
l took the liberty
of preparing a large assortment

14:42.081 --> 14:43.446
of Delta Quadrant dishes.

14:43.515 --> 14:46.313
Hopefully, there's something
here that you'll like.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.080
You're Talax- ilzay.

14:48.153 --> 14:51.179
Talaxian, but you're right.

14:51.257 --> 14:55.353
My ancestors referred
to themselves as Talax- ilzay

14:55.427 --> 14:57.054
in the Old Tongue.

14:57.129 --> 14:59.723
The Old Tongue was new
when l met your race.

14:59.798 --> 15:01.891
You traveled
all the way to Talaxia?

15:02.001 --> 15:03.059
And farther.

15:03.168 --> 15:05.261
Our corridors took us
to many worlds.

15:05.371 --> 15:06.463
l'm curious.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.563
Have you heard of us,
the Vaadwaur?

15:08.674 --> 15:12.974
Oh, l'm afraid there aren't
many records from that period,

15:13.045 --> 15:16.276
but Vaadwaur is a word
in the Old Tongue.

15:16.348 --> 15:18.407
lt means, uh, ''foolish.''

15:21.020 --> 15:24.649
l'm, uh, l'm sure that it's, uh,
just a coincidence, of course.

15:24.723 --> 15:26.623
l... l didn't mean to be rude.

15:26.692 --> 15:28.421
Your ancestors were wise.

15:28.494 --> 15:32.931
Only fools would let
this happen to them.

15:36.035 --> 15:37.468
Chakotay to Captain Janeway.

15:37.536 --> 15:38.730
Go ahead.

15:38.837 --> 15:40.896
Looks like our friends in orbit
have found us.

15:41.006 --> 15:42.473
We're on our way.

15:45.511 --> 15:46.603
Report.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.739
Six Turei vessels are in orbit,
all firing plasma charges.

15:49.815 --> 15:52.943
That was 2,000 meters
to starboard.

15:53.018 --> 15:53.950
Looks like they can't

15:54.086 --> 15:55.485
get an exact fix
on our position.

15:55.554 --> 15:58.148
The radiogenic atmosphere must
be disrupting their targeting.

15:59.792 --> 16:00.690
900 meters.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.124
They're getting closer.

16:02.161 --> 16:03.423
Can we return fire?

16:03.495 --> 16:05.122
We have the same problem.

16:05.197 --> 16:06.357
Our torpedoes won't lock on.

16:06.432 --> 16:07.399
Direct hit.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.400
Aft shields down to 18 percent.

16:09.501 --> 16:11.662
Captain, can you
transmit a signal

16:11.770 --> 16:13.328
through this atmosphere?

16:13.439 --> 16:15.031
We've already tried
talking to them.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.335
l have no intention of
speaking with the Turei.

16:17.409 --> 16:18.967
We put a sentry
satellite in orbit

16:19.044 --> 16:20.170
directly above the city.

16:20.245 --> 16:23.976
You could use its sensors
to help guide your torpedoes.

16:24.049 --> 16:26.142
lt's there,
intact and functional.

16:27.519 --> 16:29.146
Open a channel.

16:29.221 --> 16:31.815
l'll give you
the activation code.

16:36.462 --> 16:38.623
l'm a few centuries out of date.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.562
You can enter
the activation code here.

16:43.902 --> 16:45.563
lt's processing our telemetry.

16:45.671 --> 16:46.660
Triangulate.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.741
Fire.

16:50.809 --> 16:51.741
Direct hit.

16:51.810 --> 16:54.438
The lead ship has lost shields.

16:54.513 --> 16:55.673
lts propulsion is down.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.409
One more torpedo
will finish them.

16:57.483 --> 16:59.542
The other ships are retreating.

16:59.618 --> 17:01.381
Captain, why don't you
keep firing?

17:01.487 --> 17:03.011
We've scared them off.
That's enough for now.

17:03.055 --> 17:05.489
But they'll come back
with twice as many ships.

17:05.557 --> 17:07.218
With any luck,
our warp drive will be

17:07.291 --> 17:08.259
back on line by then.

17:08.327 --> 17:10.454
The Turei may be cowards,

17:10.529 --> 17:13.656
but their technology has become
much more advanced than ours.

17:13.732 --> 17:17.429
lf you leave us,
we will be slaughtered again.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.969
What do you propose?

17:19.038 --> 17:21.006
Help us off this planet,

17:21.073 --> 17:24.509
and we will show you
subspace corridors

17:24.609 --> 17:26.510
known to nobody else.

17:26.578 --> 17:28.808
You will be free from the Turei,

17:28.881 --> 17:31.475
and you will be
a thousand light- years

17:31.550 --> 17:34.951
closer to your home.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.591
Let's wake up your battalion.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.019
Dragon's teeth.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.578
''Dragon's teeth''?

18:10.656 --> 18:12.214
An old Greek myth.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.555
After a dragon
was killed in a war,

18:14.626 --> 18:18.323
its teeth were spread out
over the battlefield.

18:18.397 --> 18:19.830
They took root,

18:19.965 --> 18:22.229
and warriors sprung
from the ground

18:22.301 --> 18:24.861
to continue the fighting.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.766
Captain's Log, supplemental.

18:32.878 --> 18:35.438
We've revived
nearly 200 of the Vaadwaur,

18:35.514 --> 18:40.042
and we're moving forward
with our unexpected alliance.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.019
Voyager was pulled
into the corridor,

18:42.087 --> 18:43.782
200 light- years from here.

18:43.856 --> 18:44.880
Pulled in?

18:44.990 --> 18:46.890
There must have been a break
along the radial wall.

18:47.025 --> 18:49.516
The corridors occur naturally,
but they're very unstable.

18:49.595 --> 18:51.085
They're damaged by use.

18:51.163 --> 18:53.324
Obviously, the Turei
don't have the wisdom

18:53.398 --> 18:54.763
to maintain them properly.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.733
They'll be very difficult

18:56.835 --> 18:58.359
to navigate after
centuries of neglect.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.528
We've only

18:59.638 --> 19:01.265
been able to chart
a few of the corridors.

19:01.373 --> 19:03.204
Can you provide us
with a more complete map?

19:03.275 --> 19:05.106
We've never kept
written records

19:05.177 --> 19:06.576
for security reasons.

19:06.645 --> 19:09.705
Of course, we've committed
all the corridors to memory- -

19:09.781 --> 19:12.181
every multifold,
every spatial intersect.

19:12.251 --> 19:14.082
We'll be happy to plot
a course for you,

19:14.153 --> 19:16.212
but first, we'll need
to get past the Turei.

19:16.288 --> 19:18.347
How many vessels are in orbit?

19:18.423 --> 19:19.822
Eleven.

19:19.892 --> 19:22.292
Mr. Gaul, Tuvok, start working
on a tactical plan.

19:22.361 --> 19:24.386
lf we do manage to escape,

19:24.463 --> 19:26.260
we'll need to locate
a habitable world.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.559
Seven,

19:27.633 --> 19:28.964
scan the astrometric
database.

19:29.067 --> 19:30.034
See what you can find.

19:30.135 --> 19:31.295
Someplace out of the way.

19:31.403 --> 19:32.597
Yes, Captain.

19:32.704 --> 19:35.036
Morin, take charge of reviving
the rest of our battalion.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.665
Many of our bio- pods
have been damaged.

19:36.775 --> 19:37.833
l could use some assistance.

19:37.943 --> 19:40.537
Our Chief Engineer will be glad
to give you a hand.

19:40.612 --> 19:41.579
Thank you.

19:41.647 --> 19:43.080
Well, let's get started.

19:43.148 --> 19:45.173
We've got a civilization
to rebuild.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.388
No story tonight, Naomi.

20:00.465 --> 20:02.865
l had to cook
for 200 people today.

20:02.968 --> 20:04.128
That's okay.

20:04.236 --> 20:05.533
l'm tired, too.

20:06.939 --> 20:10.739
Did you get a chance
to meet any of the children?

20:10.809 --> 20:13.437
l don't like them.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.173
Why not?

20:15.247 --> 20:16.942
l just don't.

20:17.015 --> 20:19.279
Well, that's not good enough.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.717
l'm the ship's Ambassador.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.152
You're the Captain's Assistant.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.746
We have to make
a- a good impression

20:24.823 --> 20:25.790
on our new friends.

20:25.857 --> 20:27.825
They're not my friends.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.862
Well... not yet.

20:30.929 --> 20:34.160
Listen... first thing tomorrow,
you and l will get together

20:34.233 --> 20:35.962
with a couple
of the children...

20:36.068 --> 20:37.092
No.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.797
Naomi, what's wrong?

20:41.907 --> 20:42.839
Nothing.

20:42.908 --> 20:43.966
l don't like them,

20:44.076 --> 20:46.237
and l don't want
to play with them.

20:46.311 --> 20:48.745
That doesn't sound like you.

20:48.814 --> 20:51.806
Tell me what happened.

20:51.883 --> 20:54.113
They called you names.

20:54.186 --> 20:56.518
Names?

20:56.588 --> 20:59.022
They said everybody from
your planet was stupid.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.581
They said your ears were funny.

21:00.692 --> 21:03.058
They said just looking
at you made them laugh.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.027
They said...

21:04.096 --> 21:07.259
l- l- l... l get the idea.

21:07.332 --> 21:10.859
Children can be
a little cruel sometimes,

21:10.969 --> 21:14.666
but there's no need
to take it personally.

21:14.773 --> 21:18.766
Besides, my ears are
kind of funny.

21:18.877 --> 21:21.903
l don't want to play with them.

21:21.980 --> 21:25.472
Well... and you don't have to.

21:25.550 --> 21:26.847
Okay.

21:26.918 --> 21:28.044
Come on.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.683
Good night.

21:33.759 --> 21:36.091
l'll tell you
a story tomorrow, l promise.

21:45.871 --> 21:48.431
l'm not happy
with these fluctuations.

21:48.540 --> 21:52.442
We may be trying to reactivate
too many ships at once.

21:52.511 --> 21:55.139
l suggest we focus
on the assault fighters.

21:58.016 --> 21:59.779
Qual tel t'pok.

22:01.186 --> 22:02.414
Thanks.

22:02.487 --> 22:04.387
When did you learn Klingon?

22:04.456 --> 22:05.889
Just a few phrases.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.084
l was studying your database.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.424
The Klingons are a noble race.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.827
They have their moments.

22:12.898 --> 22:15.059
''Today is a good day to die.''

22:15.167 --> 22:16.429
Pardon?

22:16.535 --> 22:18.628
Kahless, your greatest warrior.

22:18.737 --> 22:20.728
That was his battle cry.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.397
You seem to have taken
an interest

22:22.507 --> 22:23.633
in Klingon history.

22:23.742 --> 22:26.210
There are many parallels
between our cultures.

22:26.311 --> 22:30.247
The Vaadwaur have also learned
to embrace death without fear.

22:30.315 --> 22:33.614
As children, we're taught
to fall asleep each night

22:33.685 --> 22:37.553
imagining a different
way to die.

22:37.622 --> 22:39.089
l prefer curling up
with a good book.

22:39.157 --> 22:41.125
Hmm.

22:45.364 --> 22:49.391
Computer,
access my personal database.

22:49.501 --> 22:52.334
Access established.

22:52.404 --> 22:55.305
Go into the Talaxian
linguistic files,

22:55.374 --> 22:58.468
Old Tongue dialect.

22:58.543 --> 23:02.741
Find and define
the word ''Vaadwaur. ''

23:02.814 --> 23:05.578
Vaadwaur: archaic adjective.

23:05.650 --> 23:07.811
Primary meaning: foolish.

23:07.886 --> 23:11.720
Additional meanings:
Weak- minded, reckless, blind.

23:13.992 --> 23:16.392
What's the first known usage?

23:16.461 --> 23:21.592
First written example appears
in Eldaxon's Collected Folklore,

23:21.666 --> 23:23.031
Second Edition.

23:23.135 --> 23:28.869
Year of publication,
5012, New Calendar.

23:30.509 --> 23:33.740
Computer,
name the specific folktales

23:33.812 --> 23:36.713
that use the word ''Vaadwaur.''

23:36.782 --> 23:39.808
''The Demon
with the Golden Voice,''

23:39.885 --> 23:43.321
''The Tale
of the Deadly Stranger,''

23:43.388 --> 23:47.188
''The Tale of the Boy
Who Lost His Head,''

23:47.259 --> 23:49.227
''The Tale of the Bloody Hand.''

23:49.294 --> 23:53.128
Not exactly Mother Goose.

23:53.198 --> 23:57.828
Computer, transfer the text
of those stories to my quarters.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.904
Transfer complete.

24:00.939 --> 24:03.237
That star cluster in Grid 1421?

24:03.308 --> 24:05.868
Nearly half the planets
are inhabitable.

24:06.011 --> 24:09.845
Unfortunately, they are already
occupied by the Borg.

24:09.915 --> 24:12.213
The Borg?

24:12.284 --> 24:14.718
ln my century,
they'd only assimilated

24:14.786 --> 24:16.549
a handful of systems.

24:16.621 --> 24:19.556
lt looks like they've
spread through the Quadrant

24:19.624 --> 24:21.387
like a plague.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.325
No offense.

24:23.395 --> 24:24.555
None taken.

24:24.629 --> 24:29.726
We had a colony near
the twin star in Grid 315.

24:29.835 --> 24:32.167
That is part
of the Devore lmperium now.

24:32.237 --> 24:33.761
And who are they?

24:33.872 --> 24:35.237
An authoritarian regime.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.241
They claim 1 1 systems
across three sectors.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.402
l don't suppose they'd
be willing to negotiate

24:39.478 --> 24:41.912
for a continent or two.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.107
The Devore are
intolerant of outsiders.

24:44.182 --> 24:45.149
Well, it doesn't matter.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.946
We have nothing
to negotiate with.

24:47.085 --> 24:49.849
Our technology is 900
years out of date.

24:49.921 --> 24:52.719
Your pessimism is irrelevant.

24:52.791 --> 24:55.453
We will find a home for you.

24:55.527 --> 24:57.688
l hope you're right.

24:57.762 --> 24:59.889
16 Turei vessels
are now in orbit.

24:59.965 --> 25:03.093
Long- range sensors
indicate five more on the way.

25:03.201 --> 25:04.395
l can understand

25:04.503 --> 25:06.095
that they want
the odds in their favor,

25:06.204 --> 25:07.330
but isn't that overkill?

25:07.439 --> 25:08.667
They may have detected us.

25:08.773 --> 25:11.970
lf they know their history,
they'll come prepared.

25:12.043 --> 25:14.204
900 years is a long time
to hold a grudge.

25:14.279 --> 25:15.974
The Turei would
like nothing more

25:16.047 --> 25:18.572
than to find the rest of
our subspace corridors.

25:18.650 --> 25:21.380
We can't allow that to happen.

25:21.453 --> 25:25.082
Then l suggest
we use the element of surprise.

25:25.156 --> 25:27.784
At 0600, Voyager
will leave the surface

25:27.859 --> 25:29.884
and engage the Turei ships
in orbit.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.518
As we draw their fire,

25:31.596 --> 25:33.154
the more powerful
Vaadwaur vessels

25:33.231 --> 25:35.529
will attack
from multiple vectors.

25:35.634 --> 25:37.465
The rest of the Vaadwaur
will break orbit

25:37.569 --> 25:39.161
from the opposite side
of the planet

25:39.271 --> 25:40.898
and proceed
to the subspace corridors.

25:41.072 --> 25:42.835
We'll rendezvous
with them afterwards.

25:42.908 --> 25:44.273
What if Voyager is disabled?

25:44.342 --> 25:45.331
We'll be defenseless.

25:45.443 --> 25:47.911
lf we armed my ships
with your photon torpedoes...

25:48.013 --> 25:49.571
l can't authorize that.

25:49.648 --> 25:50.740
Why not?

25:50.815 --> 25:52.248
Starfleet protocols
are very strict

25:52.317 --> 25:53.648
about the transfer of weapons.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.948
l'm not used to putting my life
into someone else's hands.

25:56.021 --> 25:57.921
There are a lot of things you're
going to have to get used to.

25:57.989 --> 26:00.287
We've faced enemies
worse than the Turei.

26:00.358 --> 26:01.552
l'm confident
we can handle them.

26:01.626 --> 26:03.287
l need those weapons.

26:03.361 --> 26:05.352
l'm sorry.
The answer's no.

26:05.430 --> 26:07.398
lf you want access
to our corridors...

26:07.465 --> 26:10.093
We'll continue home through
open space if we have to.

26:13.371 --> 26:14.838
All right.

26:14.940 --> 26:16.464
Our lives are in your hands.

26:19.010 --> 26:22.343
We've found a planet in a nebula

26:22.414 --> 26:25.815
near the junction
of Corridors 39 and 87 5.

26:25.884 --> 26:27.681
We'd be isolated
and relatively safe.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.413
''Relatively''?

26:29.487 --> 26:31.318
l'm afraid the planet
is somewhat harsh.

26:31.389 --> 26:33.016
There are no large
bodies of water,

26:33.091 --> 26:34.422
and the vegetation is sparse.

26:34.492 --> 26:35.584
This is absurd!

26:35.660 --> 26:39.619
Ensign, we need a power coupling
over here, on the double.

26:39.698 --> 26:41.131
Our plan was

26:41.199 --> 26:42.894
to reoccupy one of
our former colonies,

26:43.068 --> 26:45.127
gain allies,
rebuild our forces- -

26:45.236 --> 26:46.828
take back what was ours!

26:46.938 --> 26:49.566
Our former colonies
are destroyed or were occupied

26:49.674 --> 26:51.904
by species that are far
more advanced than we are.

26:51.977 --> 26:53.945
Then we'll find a way
to take them back.

26:54.012 --> 26:55.070
With what?

26:55.146 --> 26:57.671
A battalion of obsolete ships
and outdated weapons?

26:57.749 --> 27:01.981
No... with Voyager.

27:02.053 --> 27:03.816
l've been studying
their technology- -

27:03.922 --> 27:06.015
the control systems,
propulsion, weaponry.

27:06.091 --> 27:08.218
We could learn to operate
the vessel ourselves.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.193
What are you saying?

27:10.261 --> 27:11.558
After they engage the Turei,

27:11.630 --> 27:13.222
they'll expect us
to assist them.

27:13.298 --> 27:14.356
lnstead, we'll attack.

27:14.432 --> 27:16.161
We'll put as many
soldiers as we can

27:16.267 --> 27:18.394
onto Voyager and take it
into the corridors!

27:18.503 --> 27:20.232
This is a mistake.

27:20.338 --> 27:21.965
lf we fail,
we'll lose everything.

27:22.073 --> 27:24.564
lf you'd like, l can return you
to your stasis pod.

27:24.676 --> 27:26.940
lnform the others.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.684
This is an M- Class planet
in orbit of a Type- G star.

27:34.753 --> 27:36.687
We've located a continent
with edible vegetation

27:36.755 --> 27:39.724
and an underground water supply.

27:39.791 --> 27:41.986
Unfortunately, the region
is subject to windstorms.

27:42.060 --> 27:43.322
Not exactly paradise.

27:43.395 --> 27:44.885
You will adapt.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.895
Practical and to the point- -

27:46.965 --> 27:49.126
just like my wife.

27:49.234 --> 27:51.998
She had a knack
for cutting to the truth.

27:52.103 --> 27:53.900
She must have been
an efficient individual.

27:54.072 --> 27:55.471
Ah, to say the least.

27:55.540 --> 27:57.098
You would have enjoyed
her company.

27:57.208 --> 28:01.235
You are not at all
like the Borg l knew.

28:01.312 --> 28:07.148
As a drone, l helped assimilate
many civilizations.

28:07.218 --> 28:11.621
Now l have the opportunity
to help reconstruct one.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.988
l find the experience...

28:14.059 --> 28:16.289
gratifying.

28:16.361 --> 28:17.953
So do l.

28:18.029 --> 28:21.692
l'm curious- -

28:21.766 --> 28:27.363
has your crew ever considered
finding a planet of their own,

28:27.472 --> 28:28.939
a place to settle down?

28:29.040 --> 28:30.667
Captain Janeway is committed

28:30.742 --> 28:32.710
to getting Voyager
back to Earth.

28:32.811 --> 28:34.278
That could take decades...

28:34.345 --> 28:36.438
and there are
many dangers ahead.

28:36.514 --> 28:39.142
We will adapt.

28:40.518 --> 28:41.883
l suppose you will.

28:41.986 --> 28:43.749
Neelix to Seven of Nine.

28:43.822 --> 28:44.880
Yes?

28:44.956 --> 28:46.890
Could l see you in Cargo Bay 2?

28:46.991 --> 28:48.117
lt's important.

28:48.193 --> 28:49.660
Acknowledged.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.253
l'm due for a final briefing
with your Mr. Tuvok.

28:52.330 --> 28:54.127
l'll accompany you
to the Bridge.

29:06.478 --> 29:07.809
l'm sorry to bother you,

29:07.946 --> 29:10.471
but l've been doing
some research on our new allies,

29:10.548 --> 29:13.540
and l have found something
very interesting.

29:13.618 --> 29:16.052
ln dozens of the ancient
folktales of my people,

29:16.121 --> 29:17.611
there's a common theme.

29:17.689 --> 29:21.557
They describe a phantom army
that appears out of thin air,

29:21.626 --> 29:23.560
destroys entire colonies,

29:23.628 --> 29:26.028
and vanishes in the blink
of an eye.

29:26.097 --> 29:27.826
Sound familiar?

29:27.966 --> 29:29.957
The subspace corridors.

29:30.068 --> 29:31.296
Exactly!

29:31.402 --> 29:34.769
Gedrin claims they've been
using them as trade routes,

29:34.839 --> 29:36.773
but l'm starting to wonder.

29:36.841 --> 29:39.537
Your source material is
folktales, Mr. Neelix.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.977
But many fables have
a basis in reality.

29:42.046 --> 29:44.674
You've got
the collective knowledge

29:44.749 --> 29:45.977
of thousands of species.

29:46.050 --> 29:48.018
You could cross- reference
my findings.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.847
lt'll only take a few minutes.

30:07.105 --> 30:10.097
Come in.

30:10.208 --> 30:13.541
You wanted to see me, Captain?

30:13.611 --> 30:15.841
Yes.

30:15.914 --> 30:18.940
l need a little history lesson.

30:19.083 --> 30:22.644
Can't it... wait until after
we've reached the corridors?

30:22.720 --> 30:23.744
l'm afraid not.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.790
l've just had a conversation

30:25.857 --> 30:27.950
with Mr. Neelix
and Seven of Nine.

30:28.059 --> 30:30.493
They've been poring through
various databases

30:30.562 --> 30:33.895
and have come up with
some surprising findings.

30:33.965 --> 30:35.262
Surprising?

30:35.333 --> 30:37.767
You told me the Vaadwaur
were a culture

30:37.869 --> 30:41.532
of merchants and scientists,
who expanded their knowledge

30:41.639 --> 30:45.837
by using subspace corridors
to travel to other worlds.

30:45.910 --> 30:48.174
You were the envy
of hundreds of species,

30:48.246 --> 30:49.577
some of whom eventually

30:49.647 --> 30:51.672
wanted the corridors
for themselves.

30:55.753 --> 30:57.983
Your point?

30:58.056 --> 31:00.786
Let me give you another
version of events.

31:03.394 --> 31:06.693
The Vaadwaur were
an aggressive culture,

31:06.764 --> 31:08.493
who expanded their territory

31:08.566 --> 31:11.694
by using the corridors
to attack other worlds...

31:11.803 --> 31:14.271
until some of those
worlds banded together

31:14.339 --> 31:15.431
to defend themselves

31:15.540 --> 31:17.440
and put an end
to the Vaadwaur threat

31:17.508 --> 31:18.941
once and for all.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.511
Would you care to set
the record straight?

31:21.579 --> 31:23.444
That was 900 years ago.

31:23.514 --> 31:26.312
lf we're going to be
fighting side- by- side,

31:26.384 --> 31:28.579
l have to trust you.

31:28.653 --> 31:29.677
l need to be certain

31:29.754 --> 31:31.619
you don't have
any ulterior motives.

31:31.689 --> 31:34.214
Our only motive is survival.

31:34.292 --> 31:36.556
lf l were to take you
at your word,

31:36.628 --> 31:39.825
the ancient Talaxians
might call me Vaadwaur- -

31:39.898 --> 31:41.229
''foolish.''

31:41.299 --> 31:43.096
That's what they
came to call anyone

31:43.201 --> 31:45.863
who allowed themselves
to be deceived by an enemy.

31:45.970 --> 31:48.837
There are hundreds of other
references just like it.

31:49.908 --> 31:53.503
Both versions of our history
are true.

31:53.578 --> 31:56.172
We did use the corridors
to explore,

31:56.247 --> 31:59.011
and, on occasion,
expand our territory,

31:59.150 --> 32:00.845
but, Captain, we have gone

32:00.952 --> 32:03.352
from a population
of six billion to 600.

32:03.388 --> 32:04.878
Our weapons are archaic.

32:05.023 --> 32:08.151
Do you really think that
we are prepared to declare war

32:08.226 --> 32:09.716
on the Delta Quadrant?

32:09.794 --> 32:11.159
Not yet,

32:11.229 --> 32:13.697
but right now,
it's Voyager l'm worried about.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.858
The Turei are going to be firing

32:15.934 --> 32:18.129
everything they've got
at my ship.

32:18.236 --> 32:19.999
You might try
to take advantage of that.

32:20.104 --> 32:22.800
What are you going to do- - 
put us all back into stasis?

32:22.907 --> 32:26.365
We said we'd try to help you
make a new start,

32:26.477 --> 32:28.945
and l want to keep that promise,

32:29.047 --> 32:32.210
but l can't ignore history,
Mr. Gedrin.

32:43.528 --> 32:47.328
Make yourself comfortable,
Mr. Gedrin.

32:47.398 --> 32:49.298
Chakotay...

32:49.367 --> 32:52.359
l don't know whether
to believe him or not.

32:52.437 --> 32:54.905
What l wouldn't give
for a Betazoid about now.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.874
lf Mr. Neelix is right,
we should be ready for anything.

32:57.942 --> 32:59.603
Their technology
may be outdated,

32:59.677 --> 33:01.542
but it can still do
a lot of damage.

33:01.646 --> 33:02.578
Agreed.

33:02.613 --> 33:04.547
Maintain a full security alert

33:04.615 --> 33:07.106
and have Tuvok keep
a weapons lock

33:07.185 --> 33:08.812
on their primary reactor.

33:08.886 --> 33:11.184
Are we still proceeding
at 0600 hours?

33:11.255 --> 33:12.222
Yes,

33:12.290 --> 33:15.521
but with a few modifications.

33:15.593 --> 33:17.060
What's Mr. Gaul's location?

33:17.128 --> 33:19.528
He's in the Central Chamber.

33:19.597 --> 33:22.395
Hail him.

33:22.467 --> 33:25.061
Captain, we've reactivated
73 assault vessels.

33:25.169 --> 33:26.693
Our pilots are standing by.

33:26.804 --> 33:32.936
l need to inform you
about a change of plan.

33:33.077 --> 33:35.375
l want you to deactivate
the particle cannons

33:35.446 --> 33:37.914
on all but ten
of your assault vessels.

33:37.982 --> 33:39.813
Then we'll proceed on schedule.

33:39.884 --> 33:41.442
l don't understand.

33:41.519 --> 33:44.647
Only ten of your ships
are going to engage the Turei.

33:44.722 --> 33:48.089
The others will head directly
for the subspace corridors.

33:48.159 --> 33:50.389
l see no reason
for those to be armed.

33:50.461 --> 33:51.723
Something could go wrong.

33:51.796 --> 33:53.161
Why leave them defenseless?

33:53.231 --> 33:57.099
Voyager will defend them.

33:57.201 --> 33:58.964
What prompted this change?

33:59.103 --> 34:02.004
You haven't been completely
honest about your past,

34:02.106 --> 34:05.439
and that makes me a little
uncertain about the present.

34:07.345 --> 34:09.040
Gedrin.

34:09.112 --> 34:11.239
l suggest you listen to her.

34:11.315 --> 34:13.340
Request denied, Captain.

34:13.418 --> 34:15.045
lt's not a request.

34:15.119 --> 34:17.713
You can call it an ultimatum
if you like.

34:17.789 --> 34:18.983
Unacceptable.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.752
l'm going to leave this planet

34:20.824 --> 34:22.656
in one hour with or without you.

34:22.726 --> 34:27.494
We did not spend 900 years in
stasis to take orders from you.

34:31.936 --> 34:33.096
Contact the battalion.

34:33.204 --> 34:35.195
Tell them to prepare
for the attack.

34:37.842 --> 34:39.503
l don't know
about the rest of you,

34:39.577 --> 34:40.908
but l'm ready to get moving.

34:40.978 --> 34:41.909
What's our status?

34:41.978 --> 34:43.344
lmpulse engines are on line.

34:43.414 --> 34:45.813
Shields at maximum.
Weapons standing by.

34:45.882 --> 34:48.181
Tom, prepare to initiate
the ascent sequence in...

34:48.252 --> 34:49.810
Report.

34:49.887 --> 34:52.617
Massive energy readings
coming from the Central Chamber.

34:52.690 --> 34:53.850
lt's the Vaadwaur.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.654
They're launching
the first wave of ships.

34:55.726 --> 34:58.490
17 vessels have broken
through the surface.

34:58.563 --> 34:59.825
They're at an altitude

34:59.897 --> 35:02.263
of 2,000 meters
and charging weapons.

35:02.366 --> 35:05.267
Ma'am, they're not ascending
into orbit.

35:05.303 --> 35:07.635
They're heading straight
for Voyager.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.144
Tom?

35:16.214 --> 35:17.875
Engaging thrusters.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.974
lnitiating ascent sequence.

35:20.051 --> 35:22.281
Vaadwaur ships approaching
off our starboard bow.

35:25.656 --> 35:27.521
Target phasers, full spread.

35:30.161 --> 35:31.492
We're airborne.

35:31.562 --> 35:33.325
What altitude do we need
on this planet, Tom,

35:33.397 --> 35:34.455
before we can go to warp?

35:34.532 --> 35:36.762
We'll have to clear
the thermosphere.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.699
280 kilometers at least.

35:41.772 --> 35:43.637
Shields at 92 percent.

35:43.708 --> 35:44.902
Phasers.

35:53.684 --> 35:56.847
We've disabled
four of their ships.

35:56.921 --> 35:58.855
They've launched
another 39 vessels.

35:58.923 --> 36:00.185
Evasive maneuvers.

36:00.291 --> 36:01.223
lt's no use.

36:01.259 --> 36:03.386
They're closing on all sides.

36:03.461 --> 36:05.486
Direct hit
to the port thrusters.

36:05.563 --> 36:06.495
We're losing altitude.

36:06.564 --> 36:08.054
Reroute emergency power.

36:08.132 --> 36:09.827
We need to get into orbit.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.696
Targeting sensors off- line.

36:11.802 --> 36:13.167
Switching to manual.

36:13.237 --> 36:15.967
Harry, can you open
a secure channel

36:16.040 --> 36:17.974
to the Turei ships in orbit?

36:18.042 --> 36:20.203
Yes, ma'am, but that
would give away our position.

36:20.278 --> 36:21.609
They could lock on
with plasma charges.

36:21.679 --> 36:23.704
l think it's time we reacquaint
a couple of old friends.

36:23.781 --> 36:24.713
Hail them.

36:24.782 --> 36:26.750
Voyager shields are weakening,

36:26.817 --> 36:28.341
but they're gaining
altitude again.

36:28.419 --> 36:30.114
They're approaching
the thermosphere.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.348
Launch another squadron.

36:38.963 --> 36:41.796
We've got nine more fighters
on our tail.

36:41.866 --> 36:44.391
Aft shields down to 20 percent.

36:44.502 --> 36:46.060
Captain, the Turei
are responding.

36:46.170 --> 36:47.432
Put them through.

36:48.906 --> 36:49.895
What do you want?

36:50.007 --> 36:51.531
l've got a proposition for you.

36:51.642 --> 36:52.574
No more talk.

36:52.643 --> 36:54.110
Prepare to be boarded.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.680
Tell me, have you
been picking up weapons fire?

36:56.747 --> 37:01.343
We have detected some unusual
energy signatures, yes.

37:01.419 --> 37:05.219
That's because we're
under attack by the Vaadwaur.

37:05.289 --> 37:06.586
lmpossible.

37:06.657 --> 37:08.420
They were destroyed
centuries ago.

37:08.492 --> 37:10.926
Some of us have survived.

37:10.995 --> 37:13.225
They've got over 200 ships.

37:13.297 --> 37:14.958
They said something
about wanting

37:15.032 --> 37:16.499
their subspace corridors back.

37:16.601 --> 37:17.727
l suggest we join forces

37:17.835 --> 37:20.099
and try to neutralize
the threat here and now.

37:20.204 --> 37:21.637
What's more important to you?

37:21.706 --> 37:23.731
Deleting the records
of a Federation ship

37:23.841 --> 37:26.207
that means you no harm,
or defending yourselves

37:26.277 --> 37:28.142
against hundreds
of Vaadwaur fighters

37:28.212 --> 37:30.578
who are determined to
invade your under- space?

37:30.648 --> 37:32.115
l suggest you pick your enemy.

37:32.183 --> 37:34.174
Our sensors can't penetrate
the atmosphere.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.152
How can we fight
an enemy we can't see?

37:36.220 --> 37:38.882
We have access to one of their
surveillance satellites.

37:38.956 --> 37:39.888
We could use it

37:40.024 --> 37:41.787
to transmit their vital
coordinates to you.

37:43.227 --> 37:44.319
lf this is a deception...

37:44.395 --> 37:46.863
l'm having trouble establishing
a link with the satellite.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.364
Our sensor array
took heavy damage.

37:48.432 --> 37:49.592
l could access it

37:49.667 --> 37:50.895
from the underground
control chamber.

37:51.002 --> 37:51.969
Transport me there.

37:54.639 --> 37:57.369
Not all of my people
are stuck in the past, Captain.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.739
Tuvok, go with him.

38:04.181 --> 38:06.115
We've impacted their hull.

38:06.183 --> 38:07.980
There are breaches in progress
on two decks.

38:08.052 --> 38:10.714
They'll have to reroute power
from their shields to seal them.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.415
They'll have no choice
but to put down.

38:12.490 --> 38:13.718
Have our ground forces ready.

38:28.906 --> 38:31.204
We've lost impulse
engines and navigation.

38:31.275 --> 38:32.867
Thrusters are failing.

38:32.943 --> 38:34.205
We're losing altitude.

38:34.278 --> 38:35.711
Tuvok, status.

38:35.780 --> 38:36.712
Tuvok?

38:36.781 --> 38:39.443
l've lost his signal.

38:39.517 --> 38:41.781
All hands, this is the Captain.

38:41.852 --> 38:44.480
lnitiate
emergency landing procedures

38:44.555 --> 38:45.886
and arm yourselves.

38:45.990 --> 38:48.254
lf the Vaadwaur board this ship,

38:48.326 --> 38:51.489
we'll fight them hand- to- hand
if we have to.

38:52.730 --> 38:54.891
Once we've secured Voyager,
execute the crew.

38:54.965 --> 38:56.125
Wait!

38:56.200 --> 38:58.100
We have hundreds
of bio- pods still intact.

38:58.202 --> 38:59.191
Put them into stasis.

38:59.303 --> 39:01.100
ln a few hundred years,
maybe someone

39:01.205 --> 39:02.797
will be kind enough
to revive them.

39:02.940 --> 39:05.534
What is that?!

39:06.977 --> 39:08.569
lt's a plasma charge.

39:08.646 --> 39:10.170
lt came from orbit.

39:11.716 --> 39:13.809
lt's the Turei.
They've isolated our location.

39:13.951 --> 39:15.179
How?!

39:15.252 --> 39:16.412
One of the surveillance
satellites has been activated.

39:16.487 --> 39:17.351
Shut it down!

39:18.322 --> 39:20.222
They're blocking my commands.

39:20.291 --> 39:23.692
l'm rotating
the carrier frequencies.

39:27.131 --> 39:29.190
The chamber is destabilizing.

39:29.266 --> 39:30.597
We must evacuate.

39:30.701 --> 39:31.827
No, not yet.

39:31.969 --> 39:34.301
lf we're going
to succeed, l need to transmit

39:34.372 --> 39:36.704
the signatures of our fighters
to the Turei.

39:36.774 --> 39:38.401
You go.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.615
Six Vaadwaur ships were just
destroyed by the Turei.

39:49.687 --> 39:50.984
The others are breaking off
their attack.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.579
lmpulse engines?

39:52.656 --> 39:53.384
Still off- line.

39:53.457 --> 39:54.685
How about emergency power?

39:54.759 --> 39:56.454
Barely enough for life- support,
Captain.

39:56.527 --> 39:58.995
Harry, the radiogenic particles
in the atmosphere- -

39:59.063 --> 40:00.860
could we use them
as a power source?

40:00.931 --> 40:03.491
Well, we'd have to modify the
warp core's conversion matrix.

40:03.601 --> 40:04.499
lt could take hours.

40:04.602 --> 40:05.762
What if we drew the particles

40:05.870 --> 40:07.337
directly
into our plasma manifold?

40:07.405 --> 40:09.202
That would give us
one hell of a boost.

40:09.273 --> 40:11.935
lt could also blow out
every power relay on the ship.

40:12.009 --> 40:14.034
Damned if we do;
damned if we don't.

40:14.111 --> 40:15.738
Open the forward nacelle ports

40:15.813 --> 40:17.678
and reverse
the pressure gradient.

40:17.748 --> 40:20.148
Take in 600 kilograms.

40:24.221 --> 40:27.190
The chamber's collapsing, sir!

40:29.193 --> 40:31.218
We'll take as many ships
as we can.

40:31.295 --> 40:34.196
Try to reach
the subspace corridor!

40:47.111 --> 40:50.342
Particle concentration
at 3,000 parts per million.

40:50.414 --> 40:51.813
Release the manifold.

40:51.882 --> 40:56.581
Rerouting plasma
to the power conduits.

40:56.654 --> 40:58.121
We have impulse.

40:58.189 --> 40:59.588
Take us up.

41:06.564 --> 41:08.828
13 power relays just
blew out on Deck 6.

41:08.899 --> 41:09.888
Steady.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.161
We're crossing the thermosphere.

41:12.269 --> 41:13.497
Any sign of pursuit?

41:13.604 --> 41:16.596
None. Looks like the Vaadwaur
have their hands full.

41:16.707 --> 41:18.265
Altitude?

41:18.375 --> 41:22.106
260 kilometers, 270...

41:23.547 --> 41:25.310
We've cleared the thermosphere.

41:25.382 --> 41:26.644
Go to warp, Mr. Paris.

41:26.717 --> 41:28.412
Yes, ma'am.

41:43.901 --> 41:47.359
Captain's Log, Stardate 53167.9.

41:47.471 --> 41:49.939
After two days,
there's been no sign

41:50.040 --> 41:52.008
of the Vaadwaur or the Turei.

41:52.076 --> 41:55.842
However, Seven of Nine has made
an unsettling discovery.

41:55.913 --> 41:58.006
How many ships?

41:58.082 --> 41:59.947
Astrometric scans detected

42:00.017 --> 42:02.986
53 ion signatures
entering the corridors- -

42:03.087 --> 42:04.645
all Vaadwaur.

42:04.688 --> 42:06.121
The underground chambers?

42:06.190 --> 42:08.852
They were destroyed
by the Turei bombardment.

42:14.632 --> 42:16.099
Captain...

42:16.166 --> 42:19.727
l believe l made
an error in judgment.

42:19.837 --> 42:22.169
Oh?

42:22.239 --> 42:26.403
By awakening Gedrin,
l initiated a chain of events

42:26.477 --> 42:29.344
that nearly led
to our destruction.

42:29.413 --> 42:34.043
l wanted to help revive
a civilization, not start a war.

42:34.118 --> 42:37.383
You thought you were
acting out of compassion.

42:37.454 --> 42:39.820
l might have done
the same thing,

42:39.890 --> 42:42.791
but that doesn't
make it right, Seven.

42:42.860 --> 42:45.795
The repercussions of this
could be catastrophic.

42:45.863 --> 42:48.525
Their technology
is nine centuries out of date.

42:48.599 --> 42:50.897
Their plans for conquest
are irrelevant.

42:51.001 --> 42:54.960
They're a resourceful
species, determined.

42:55.105 --> 42:56.572
They'll adapt.

42:56.640 --> 42:59.973
l doubt we've seen
the last of them.
