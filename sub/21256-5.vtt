WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:04.336
We're still seeing a fair
amount of neuro information.

00:04.371 --> 00:07.673
Then I... I won't go back
to school. I can get my GED.

00:07.707 --> 00:09.508
He is potentially dangerous.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.744
Sometimes, I'm actually afraid of him.

00:11.778 --> 00:14.780
- I was wondering if I could try out for the team.
- Yeah, of course.

00:16.349 --> 00:18.150
This is my little sister, Poppy.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.395
- Hi.
- We just wanted to officially

00:19.396 --> 00:20.452
welcome you to the neighborhood.

00:20.487 --> 00:22.855
- This is my wife.
- Tess!

00:22.889 --> 00:24.823
Gabe won't be back for a couple days.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.525
You're welcome to stay here till then.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.360
We don't want you to
throw away your past.

00:28.395 --> 00:30.095
We just want you to stop repeating it.

00:30.130 --> 00:32.831
If you try to be someone
you're not, you won't be happy.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.207
Hey!

00:41.241 --> 00:42.575
Hi!

00:42.609 --> 00:44.176
Uh, missed you in class today.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.844
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.013
I just had to get a permit
for this party we're throwing.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.416
It's like a fund-raiser for derby.

00:50.450 --> 00:51.550
You should come.

00:51.585 --> 00:52.785
It's just 10 bucks to get in,

00:52.819 --> 00:54.353
and there's gonna be live music.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.255
Yeah, I'll, um, I'll try to make it.

00:56.289 --> 00:58.390
Bring some friends.
Just don't tell Mariana.

00:58.425 --> 00:59.825
I don't want her showing up with Poppy

00:59.859 --> 01:01.860
since there's gonna
be drinking and stuff.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.329
Ximena?

01:03.363 --> 01:05.030
Uh, do you have a minute?

01:05.065 --> 01:07.199
I'll text you the deets. Later.

01:07.234 --> 01:09.001
So what's going on
with your application?

01:09.035 --> 01:10.569
You should have reapplied weeks ago.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.374
Hey. You look like a human

01:15.408 --> 01:16.642
who cares about other humans.

01:16.676 --> 01:18.077
Am I right?

01:18.111 --> 01:19.311
I guess so.

01:19.346 --> 01:21.447
So, how do you feel about UCSD allowing

01:21.481 --> 01:23.082
a right wing student group

01:23.116 --> 01:26.218
to invite an anti-immigration
reform "expert"

01:26.253 --> 01:28.387
with no real academic credentials

01:28.421 --> 01:30.789
to spread her hateful
rhetoric on our campus?

01:32.192 --> 01:34.660
- Um, who is she?
- Shiloh McCullen.

01:34.694 --> 01:36.095
And we are demanding

01:36.129 --> 01:37.663
the university cancel her engagement.

01:37.697 --> 01:39.999
Uh, will you sign our petition?

01:42.068 --> 01:43.435
I'm actually not a student here.

01:44.504 --> 01:45.604
Good luck.

01:50.176 --> 01:52.711
Stef's a safe person to talk to.

01:52.746 --> 01:53.912
She helped a lot of my friends,

01:53.947 --> 01:55.981
helped them get out of trouble.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.085
I thought everything I told you
was supposed to be confidential.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.720
And it mostly is,

02:01.755 --> 02:04.256
but I'm legally obligated
to report sexual abuse.

02:07.027 --> 02:08.259
You're not in trouble, Andy.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.331
I'm not a...

02:13.566 --> 02:16.168
victim or whatever.

02:16.202 --> 02:18.771
It sounds to us like you're
engaging in survival sex.

02:20.907 --> 02:22.808
You're staying with an older man?

02:22.842 --> 02:23.909
And what if I was?

02:25.145 --> 02:27.146
Treated me hell of a lot
better than my own parents.

02:28.214 --> 02:31.116
At least I had a place
to sleep and food to eat.

02:33.186 --> 02:34.720
Well, I can't imagine...

02:36.456 --> 02:38.457
everything you've been through.

02:38.491 --> 02:40.492
The pain of being
rejected by your parents.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.329
But what this man is doing to you...

02:44.331 --> 02:45.798
it's not right.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.901
'Cause, you know, he's
exploiting you for sex.

02:50.870 --> 02:52.338
Do you think you can tell us his name?

02:56.976 --> 02:58.410
I know it's scary.

02:58.445 --> 02:59.945
I've been where you are, but...

03:01.147 --> 03:03.682
we're just trying to
help you and other kids.

03:05.318 --> 03:06.352
Andy...

03:14.461 --> 03:15.627
This is my card.

03:17.397 --> 03:18.797
You can call me at any time.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.332
Anything you need. All right?

03:21.568 --> 03:23.502
Like a haircut?

03:28.274 --> 03:29.441
Can we go?

03:37.150 --> 03:39.118
Hey, Cole. Hey, hey, hey, listen.

03:40.487 --> 03:42.121
Do you think any of the
other kids at the center

03:42.155 --> 03:43.455
would be able to ID this guy?

03:43.490 --> 03:45.557
Maybe. I'll ask around.

03:45.592 --> 03:46.825
Okay, thank you.

03:49.129 --> 03:50.863
Unfortunately, there's
not much we can do for him.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.332
There's no pimp to track,

03:53.366 --> 03:54.867
and most of these boys
don't work the streets.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.169
So, we just stop trying
to find this scumbag?

03:57.203 --> 03:59.071
We just don't have the resources.

03:59.105 --> 04:00.506
But...

04:05.311 --> 04:06.645
Hey.

04:06.679 --> 04:08.213
- You hear about Troy Johnson?
- I did.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.216
- Did you?
- Contrary to what you might think,

04:10.270 --> 04:11.403
I'm glad justice was served.

04:11.438 --> 04:12.504
Yeah, no thanks to you.

04:12.539 --> 04:14.373
Plenty of evidence pointed to Kyle.

04:14.407 --> 04:16.408
Yeah? What about the
evidence that didn't,

04:16.442 --> 04:17.576
like his alibi witness?

04:17.611 --> 04:19.211
You know, the pedophile
that you cut a deal with

04:19.245 --> 04:22.181
to make sure that he wouldn't
testify on Kyle's behalf.

04:22.215 --> 04:23.816
You really need to
learn to let things go.

04:23.850 --> 04:25.384
I am not letting anything go

04:25.418 --> 04:27.987
while Patrick Molloy is
out there preying on kids.

04:28.021 --> 04:30.055
Knock yourself out.

05:16.836 --> 05:18.103
- Hey!
- Hi!

05:18.138 --> 05:20.739
Just wanted to bring a little
something for you and Stef

05:20.774 --> 05:22.141
to say thank you for hosting

05:22.175 --> 05:23.809
such a lovely dinner the other night.

05:23.843 --> 05:24.877
Oh, thank you.

05:24.911 --> 05:26.545
Is she... here?

05:26.579 --> 05:28.480
Uh, no, she's at work.

05:28.515 --> 05:30.082
But you really didn't have to do that.

05:30.116 --> 05:31.550
It was our pleasure.

05:31.584 --> 05:33.052
Oh, hey.

05:33.086 --> 05:34.086
Hey.

05:35.088 --> 05:36.955
So, do you have plans tomorrow night?

05:36.990 --> 05:38.691
No, we're free.

05:38.725 --> 05:40.426
Well, some friends in Baltimore sent us

05:40.460 --> 05:42.094
some Kobe steaks as a housewarming gift,

05:42.128 --> 05:44.463
and it's just too much
food for the three of us.

05:44.497 --> 05:47.266
So, would you like to
join us for a barbecue?

05:47.300 --> 05:48.400
We'd love to.

05:48.435 --> 05:49.835
Right, Mama?

05:49.869 --> 05:52.338
I... that... that would
be great. Thank you.

05:52.372 --> 05:53.505
Six o'clock work?

05:53.540 --> 05:54.573
Works for us.

05:57.377 --> 05:58.610
- Are you going running?
- Yeah.

05:58.645 --> 06:00.446
Someone told me there's
a good path by the beach.

06:00.480 --> 06:03.215
Oh! I love that trail.

06:03.249 --> 06:04.249
I'm a runner, too.

06:04.284 --> 06:05.951
Since when?

06:05.985 --> 06:08.020
Since I've been getting
in really good shape?

06:08.054 --> 06:09.088
Thanks for noticing.

06:10.156 --> 06:11.190
So, you wanna come with?

06:12.525 --> 06:13.625
Yeah, sure.

06:13.660 --> 06:16.628
Um, let me just... go
get changed really quick.

06:16.663 --> 06:18.964
So, we'll see you tomorrow then.

06:18.998 --> 06:20.532
- Looking forward to it.
- Excellent.

06:20.567 --> 06:21.800
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:26.172 --> 06:28.640
Guess who's going running
with the boy next door?

06:28.675 --> 06:29.808
You don't run.

06:29.843 --> 06:31.009
Why does everyone keep saying that?

06:31.044 --> 06:32.144
Uh, 'cause it's true.

06:32.178 --> 06:34.446
Okay, he's totally into me.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.715
He just came by with his mom
to deliver a bottle of wine,

06:36.750 --> 06:38.517
which obviously
requires only one person.

06:40.253 --> 06:41.353
Oh, hey, um,

06:41.388 --> 06:43.722
have you been hanging
out with Ximena's sister?

06:44.724 --> 06:47.126
Uh... why do you ask?

06:47.160 --> 06:49.361
I don't know. It's
just Ximena told me that

06:49.396 --> 06:51.130
you guys are friends or...

06:51.164 --> 06:52.998
Oh, yeah, um...

06:53.032 --> 06:54.566
we found each other through Twitter,

06:54.601 --> 06:55.734
and... and we went to a movie.

06:56.870 --> 06:59.138
- Is that a problem?
- Um... no.

06:59.172 --> 07:00.839
Why didn't you tell me?

07:01.941 --> 07:04.076
I guess I was just...

07:04.110 --> 07:06.078
worried that you wouldn't
want me hanging out

07:06.112 --> 07:07.579
with your mentor's little sister.

07:08.615 --> 07:10.649
- It's fine by me.
- Good!

07:10.683 --> 07:12.151
Because I need new friends,

07:12.185 --> 07:14.753
especially since Emma's been
openly trolling me at school.

07:15.922 --> 07:18.290
So... how do I look?

07:20.326 --> 07:22.194
Like someone who's not a runner.

07:22.228 --> 07:23.228
How dare you.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.000
Ready?

07:36.176 --> 07:37.509
- Got you!
- Aah, no!

07:37.544 --> 07:38.777
You got me.

07:38.812 --> 07:39.912
How did you find me?

07:39.946 --> 07:42.414
You're way too good at this!

07:43.550 --> 07:44.716
Now you and Mommy find me.

07:44.751 --> 07:46.952
Y... you really don't have to...

07:46.986 --> 07:48.554
I mean, you can go if you're busy.

07:48.588 --> 07:50.456
Oh, no, I don't mind. I
don't work till later, anyway.

07:50.490 --> 07:51.824
Oh, yeah. How's that going?

07:52.826 --> 07:55.060
Uh... you know, working in fast food

07:55.094 --> 07:57.062
is everything I'd hoped it'd be.

07:57.096 --> 07:58.130
You?

07:59.432 --> 08:01.834
Uh, they made me bar manager

08:01.868 --> 08:03.068
- at the Smokehouse.
- No way!

08:03.102 --> 08:04.970
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

08:05.004 --> 08:08.006
And how's... how's Eddie?
Is he giving you any trouble?

08:08.041 --> 08:09.975
Nah. He wouldn't be Eddie if he wasn't.

08:12.178 --> 08:13.445
So, what's new with you?

08:13.480 --> 08:14.780
Seeing anyone?

08:15.849 --> 08:17.316
Sorry, you don't have to answer that.

08:17.350 --> 08:19.785
No. Uh, no, it's okay.

08:19.819 --> 08:22.020
Uh, I am. I'm seeing this girl,

08:22.055 --> 08:23.255
but, you know, we're

08:23.289 --> 08:24.590
taking things slow right now.

08:24.624 --> 08:25.624
Good idea.

08:28.761 --> 08:29.795
Um...

08:31.464 --> 08:33.532
Look, I'm sorry.

08:34.567 --> 08:36.335
I know the last time we saw each other,

08:36.369 --> 08:38.370
- I said some things...
- Things I deserved.

08:39.371 --> 08:40.472
It's okay.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.808
Your new girl is lucky
to have such a nice guy.

08:47.313 --> 08:48.447
Brandon, find me!

08:49.482 --> 08:50.516
All right.

08:50.550 --> 08:52.317
Mason, where are you?

08:57.357 --> 08:59.925
A night off from feeding the
small nation that is our family,

08:59.959 --> 09:02.294
sounds like heaven to me.

09:02.328 --> 09:03.962
It's nice to have neighbors

09:03.997 --> 09:05.664
that we actually like hanging out with.

09:05.698 --> 09:08.433
Do we like hanging out with them?

09:08.468 --> 09:10.302
I mean, Tess got a
little hostile with you

09:10.336 --> 09:12.738
about ditching her for the
cool kids in high school.

09:12.772 --> 09:15.240
She wasn't hostile. She was kidding.

09:15.275 --> 09:16.675
Speaking of hostile,

09:16.709 --> 09:18.277
you're the one that
practically bit her head off

09:18.311 --> 09:19.311
when she brought up that whole

09:19.345 --> 09:21.947
educational plan thingy for Jesus.

09:23.483 --> 09:25.117
How is he today, anyway?

09:25.151 --> 09:27.152
Oh, he's hardly gotten out of bed.

09:27.186 --> 09:29.288
I think these new meds
are wiping him out.

09:29.322 --> 09:30.956
And I think he's a little depressed.

09:30.990 --> 09:32.958
I'm sure he is, stuck
in this house all day.

09:32.992 --> 09:35.227
Which is why we're sure as hell not
gonna let him drop out of school.

09:35.261 --> 09:36.762
Well, there's no point
pushing back on that

09:36.796 --> 09:38.564
till we know if he's
well enough to go back.

09:39.699 --> 09:41.800
And I really think that
messing with his meds

09:41.834 --> 09:43.468
is just gonna end up
doing more harm than good.

09:43.503 --> 09:45.837
The doctors said that it might take
some time to find the right dosage.

09:45.872 --> 09:47.272
Yeah, he also said that they know

09:47.307 --> 09:49.107
very little about the brain.

09:49.142 --> 09:50.909
I've been reading about
homeopathic remedies

09:50.944 --> 09:52.477
and talking to some other moms online,

09:52.512 --> 09:54.913
and one of them put her
son on a gluten-free diet

09:54.948 --> 09:55.981
to help with inflammation.

09:56.015 --> 09:57.883
You really think it's that easy, Lena.

09:57.917 --> 09:59.785
I think it's worth a try.

09:59.819 --> 10:02.154
And I also found this
neurologist in Los Angeles

10:02.188 --> 10:05.023
who's doing clinical trials
with electrical current

10:05.058 --> 10:07.292
- to help stimulate the brain.
- You mean like shock treatment?

10:07.327 --> 10:08.694
- No.
- No? It...

10:08.728 --> 10:10.729
It's, like, a low targeted current.

10:10.763 --> 10:12.864
Still, it sounds scary, Lena. No.

10:13.900 --> 10:16.835
Could you... just not
say no to everything.

10:16.869 --> 10:18.737
We need to advocate for our son here.

10:18.771 --> 10:21.273
We can't just take Dr.
Danville's word for everything.

10:26.312 --> 10:27.512
I gotta take this.

10:29.782 --> 10:31.016
Hey, Cole, what's up?

10:40.627 --> 10:42.260
You okay?

10:43.997 --> 10:45.464
Yeah, totally.

10:45.498 --> 10:47.265
I just, uh...

10:47.300 --> 10:49.234
I spent, like... two hours

10:49.268 --> 10:50.902
training on skates earlier so...

10:50.937 --> 10:53.438
Yeah, I'm on a roller derby team.

10:53.473 --> 10:55.974
Or I will be after tryouts.

10:56.009 --> 10:58.043
Roller derby? Like, uh...

10:58.077 --> 10:59.845
- Like that movie.
- Whip It.

10:59.879 --> 11:01.713
Yeah.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.015
No.

11:03.049 --> 11:04.783
It's a serious sport.

11:04.817 --> 11:07.319
Very rough, lots of contact.

11:07.353 --> 11:08.920
Check it out.

11:08.955 --> 11:10.622
Damn.

11:10.657 --> 11:12.090
I'm surprised your
moms are down with that?

11:12.125 --> 11:13.659
Yeah, well...

11:14.661 --> 11:15.894
they don't exactly know yet.

11:17.497 --> 11:20.265
I'm trying to figure out a
way to, like, Inception them.

11:20.299 --> 11:22.267
Make it their idea?

11:22.301 --> 11:23.802
How are you gonna do that?

11:23.836 --> 11:25.404
I don't know yet.

11:25.438 --> 11:26.838
But I can be pretty persuasive.

11:26.873 --> 11:28.373
Oh, I bet you can.

11:28.408 --> 11:31.410
So, there is this party tomorrow night,

11:31.444 --> 11:33.612
uh, to raise money for
the roller derby team.

11:34.681 --> 11:36.248
There's gonna be live music

11:36.282 --> 11:38.517
and libations, and...

11:38.551 --> 11:40.218
The junior girls aren't exactly invited,

11:40.253 --> 11:41.920
but we're gonna crash.

11:41.954 --> 11:43.855
- Wanna come?
- Oh, yeah.

11:46.092 --> 11:48.360
So, Brandon and I are... are good.

11:49.696 --> 11:50.796
You know, it's just...

11:52.932 --> 11:55.967
I wish that I could
have been there for you.

11:56.002 --> 11:59.337
And that's not me saying
what I think you wanna hear.

11:59.372 --> 12:01.173
That's the truth. I promise.

12:03.376 --> 12:04.576
Thank you.

12:09.482 --> 12:11.483
- I miss you at school.
- Mm-hmm.

12:12.819 --> 12:13.985
Do you know when you're coming back?

12:15.822 --> 12:16.922
I'm... I'm not.

12:18.091 --> 12:19.691
I'm gonna get my GED,

12:19.726 --> 12:21.626
and I'm gonna start working
construction with Gabe.

12:22.628 --> 12:24.162
You're dropping out of school?

12:32.784 --> 12:34.952
So, all these kids are runaways?

12:34.986 --> 12:37.588
Some. A lot are throwaways like Andy.

12:37.622 --> 12:40.191
Kids whose parents kicked them out.

12:40.225 --> 12:41.258
Hey, Josh.

12:42.260 --> 12:43.260
This is Stef.

12:43.295 --> 12:44.929
Hey.

12:44.963 --> 12:46.864
How are you? Thank you
so much for helping out.

12:46.898 --> 12:48.332
- Mm-hmm.
- I really appreciate it.

12:48.366 --> 12:50.601
Cole here tells me that
you might, uh, know the guy

12:50.635 --> 12:51.902
that Andy was staying with.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.505
Yeah. He comes around here sometimes

12:54.539 --> 12:56.507
to pick up a new boy.

12:56.541 --> 12:57.942
- Is that how he met Andy?
- Yeah.

12:57.976 --> 13:01.145
Andy thought he was, like,
his boyfriend or something

13:01.179 --> 13:02.413
till he got kicked to the curb

13:02.447 --> 13:03.914
just like all them other twinks.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.218
I don't suppose you,
uh, know the guy's name.

13:07.252 --> 13:09.220
Never told me.

13:09.254 --> 13:11.255
But he's this creepy white dude.

13:11.289 --> 13:13.124
Tall... light hair...

13:14.159 --> 13:15.359
buggy eyes.

13:16.728 --> 13:18.429
Do, uh, do you know where to find him?

13:18.463 --> 13:19.763
Never been to his house,

13:19.798 --> 13:22.933
but he took me and some
of my boys to this motel,

13:22.968 --> 13:24.902
took some videos of us fooling around.

13:27.405 --> 13:29.039
I stole this off him.

13:29.074 --> 13:31.575
I was gonna sell it back to
him till he flipped out on me.

13:31.610 --> 13:33.377
Uh, what's on it?

13:33.411 --> 13:34.945
I look like I got a computer?

13:37.749 --> 13:39.717
Um... Take it off your hands?

13:39.751 --> 13:40.751
Sure.

13:41.853 --> 13:43.087
For a hundred bucks.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.026
He's barely gotten out of bed all day.

13:49.061 --> 13:50.828
Let's try increasing the dosage.

13:50.862 --> 13:52.463
How will giving him more medication

13:52.497 --> 13:54.265
decrease his side effects?

13:54.299 --> 13:55.566
Could you hold on one second?

13:56.868 --> 13:57.902
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:57.936 --> 13:59.303
I'm... I'm sorry to bother you,

13:59.337 --> 14:01.038
but our gas got turned
off for some reason,

14:01.073 --> 14:02.506
and Tess prepared all this food,

14:02.541 --> 14:03.908
and she's freaking out.

14:03.942 --> 14:07.511
Would you mind terribly if
we used your oven and grill?

14:12.284 --> 14:14.485
I feel terrible inviting you to a party

14:14.519 --> 14:15.553
at your own house.

14:15.587 --> 14:17.822
Oh, my goodness. What were you gonna do?

14:17.856 --> 14:19.223
Bring all the food over here

14:19.257 --> 14:21.492
and cook it just to carry
it back to your house?

14:21.526 --> 14:22.593
It's fine, really.

14:22.627 --> 14:24.795
Dean, these steaks,
they're cooked perfectly.

14:24.830 --> 14:26.230
Oh, good. Didn't want it so rare

14:26.264 --> 14:27.398
it was just jumping off the plate.

14:27.432 --> 14:29.533
No, they're good. They're good.

14:31.870 --> 14:32.903
Where's Emma?

14:32.938 --> 14:34.538
Uh, Shabbat with her family.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.274
- What about Cort?
- Uh, work.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.211
Hey, does Grace know
that she's staying here?

14:40.245 --> 14:42.513
Uh, I... I didn't say anything.

14:42.547 --> 14:43.948
But, I mean, it's only a couple days.

14:43.982 --> 14:45.416
Why make it weird, right?

14:45.450 --> 14:46.484
I guess.

14:46.518 --> 14:48.252
So did you pick a school for Logan yet?

14:48.286 --> 14:49.420
We did.

14:49.454 --> 14:51.188
He started at St. Mary's on Monday.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.957
Oh, my goodness. You're
not Catholic, are you?

14:52.991 --> 14:55.926
No. I'd spend way too
much time in confession.

14:57.129 --> 14:58.362
Uh, no. It's just that

14:58.396 --> 14:59.763
Catholic schools are more affordable.

14:59.798 --> 15:01.265
Plus St. Mary's has
a great football team.

15:01.299 --> 15:02.500
Mm-hmm.

15:02.534 --> 15:04.768
I've always wanted to be
a part of a team, you know?

15:04.803 --> 15:06.904
To experience the camaraderie

15:06.938 --> 15:08.305
of achieving a common goal.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.274
What about STEAM? That's
a team you're part of.

15:10.308 --> 15:14.512
I just wish there was,
like, a sport that I loved.

15:14.546 --> 15:17.414
Something that made me
aggressive and empowered.

15:17.449 --> 15:19.783
Like what Mom tried to teach
me with the self-defense.

15:19.818 --> 15:21.485
- Bu...
- Something that

15:21.520 --> 15:23.087
made me more confident.

15:23.121 --> 15:25.523
Hey, you wanna come to this
party my friend is throwing?

15:25.557 --> 15:27.291
I think there's supposed
to be, like, live music.

15:27.325 --> 15:29.226
Uh, I... I can't. I
have plans with Grace.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.427
So bring her.

15:30.462 --> 15:32.730
Just, um, don't tell Mariana.

15:32.764 --> 15:35.232
So, Logan, how do you
like our St. Mary's?

15:35.267 --> 15:36.300
You like your new teammates?

15:36.334 --> 15:37.801
Uh, they're cool.

15:37.836 --> 15:40.971
I'd rather be home, though,
back with my old team.

15:41.006 --> 15:43.507
You've always been great
at making new friends.

15:43.542 --> 15:44.808
Still would have been nice to graduate

15:44.843 --> 15:46.277
with the friends I grew up with, though.

15:46.311 --> 15:47.912
Listen, I know you miss them,

15:47.946 --> 15:49.680
but high school friendships don't last.

15:49.714 --> 15:52.082
It's college where you make
the friendships that stick.

15:54.986 --> 15:56.987
Well, we should get going if
we're gonna make that movie.

15:57.022 --> 15:58.489
- Yeah.
- Oh, can I go?

15:58.523 --> 16:00.191
No!

16:00.225 --> 16:02.593
I... I mean, you're not allowed, right?

16:02.627 --> 16:04.295
It's just a movie.

16:04.329 --> 16:06.330
Yeah, but a chick flick.
You don't like chick flicks.

16:06.364 --> 16:08.332
I don't really care. I just
gotta get out of this house.

16:08.366 --> 16:10.768
Come on, I'll be sitting
down the whole time.

16:10.802 --> 16:12.236
Please?

16:13.238 --> 16:16.774
- Okay.
- I should get going, too.

16:16.808 --> 16:18.275
There's this get-together

16:18.310 --> 16:19.777
with some kids from my art class.

16:20.912 --> 16:22.680
Yeah, Grace is picking me up.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.717
Oh, no one wants to
hang with the old folks?

16:26.751 --> 16:28.919
I guess not. Hey. Goodbye.

16:28.954 --> 16:30.221
- See ya.
- Have fun.

16:31.823 --> 16:33.224
I have to tell you guys,

16:33.258 --> 16:35.059
you've raised some amazing kids.

16:35.093 --> 16:36.460
Thank you.

16:36.494 --> 16:37.528
They are good kids.

16:37.562 --> 16:38.796
Most of the time.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.734
You can't come with us, Jesus.

16:43.768 --> 16:45.736
Yes, I can. Moms just said.

16:45.770 --> 16:47.771
Okay, look. We're not going to a movie.

16:47.806 --> 16:48.806
We're going to a party.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.308
But... Killer. Even better.

16:51.343 --> 16:52.810
You can't go to a party, Jesus.

16:52.844 --> 16:54.979
Okay, then neither
can you, or I'll tell.

16:55.013 --> 16:56.247
Hey, you ready?

16:57.382 --> 16:58.415
Hell yeah, bro.

17:28.684 --> 17:32.020
- Damn, this party is lit, yo.
- This is sick!

17:35.391 --> 17:37.926
Hey, you. No dancing, no drinking.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.661
Just find a place to sit and watch.

17:40.663 --> 17:41.897
Ooh, I'll be right back.

17:43.599 --> 17:46.668
Hey, you came!

17:46.702 --> 17:48.803
I did. Have you seen Ximena yet?

17:48.838 --> 17:50.505
Yeah, but she hasn't seen me.

17:50.540 --> 17:52.107
Do you think she's gonna
be mad that we crashed?

17:52.141 --> 17:53.808
What's she gonna do about it?

17:53.843 --> 17:57.012
Hey, who are those two hot
papis you rolled in with?

17:57.046 --> 17:59.481
Oh, uh, the tall one's
my brother, Jesus.

17:59.515 --> 18:01.650
But don't tell him about derby.

18:01.684 --> 18:02.984
I'm not telling anyone but my moms

18:03.019 --> 18:04.152
just in case I don't make the team.

18:04.187 --> 18:06.388
What are you talkin'
about? You're gonna make it.

18:06.422 --> 18:08.390
Okay, okay. Who's the other one?

18:10.059 --> 18:12.060
That is my future boyfriend.

18:12.094 --> 18:13.094
- Oh!
- Mm!

18:13.129 --> 18:14.196
Come meet him.

18:16.666 --> 18:19.367
These girls are wicked.

18:19.402 --> 18:21.236
- Let's dance.
- Uh...

18:21.270 --> 18:22.637
Oh, I'm fine. You go.

18:30.012 --> 18:31.646
- Hey, chica!
- Hey!

18:31.681 --> 18:34.015
- What's up, X?
- Oh, Sean.

18:34.050 --> 18:36.251
This is my friend, Callie.

18:36.285 --> 18:39.321
It's you. The girl
who doesn't go to UCSD.

18:39.355 --> 18:42.057
No, she does. We have
art class together.

18:42.091 --> 18:43.925
Uh... no, I'm auditing.

18:43.960 --> 18:45.293
Well, if you're gonna be on campus,

18:45.328 --> 18:46.795
you should care about what's going on.

18:46.829 --> 18:48.063
Couldn't get her to sign the petition.

18:48.097 --> 18:49.998
Not everyone's into the issues.

18:50.032 --> 18:51.933
Yeah? Well, everyone should be.

18:51.968 --> 18:53.768
There's more at stake now than ever.

18:53.803 --> 18:55.170
If you're ready to get woke,

18:55.204 --> 18:56.571
we're meeting at the quad tomorrow.

18:56.606 --> 18:59.374
Come on, boots, let's dance!

18:59.408 --> 19:01.009
- You too, girl.
- Oh, uh...

19:01.043 --> 19:03.078
No, I have some friends
I should check on.

19:03.112 --> 19:04.679
All right, but don't
think you're off the hook.

19:04.714 --> 19:06.581
Later, I'm coming for you!

19:23.766 --> 19:25.734
Honey, maybe we should, uh,
keep it down a little bit.

19:25.768 --> 19:27.068
I think Cort's home.

19:27.103 --> 19:28.436
Oh.

19:29.605 --> 19:32.641
Our son's ex-girlfriend is staying

19:32.675 --> 19:36.244
in the garage apartment
with her three-year-old son.

19:36.279 --> 19:37.345
He's not Brandon's.

19:38.347 --> 19:39.581
What about the construction worker

19:39.615 --> 19:40.749
I always see in the yard?

19:40.783 --> 19:43.618
Oh, Gabe? He's, uh, he's
the twins' birth father.

19:43.653 --> 19:47.889
He's staying here because
he's homeless right now.

19:47.923 --> 19:49.291
So you're in touch
with the birth parents?

19:49.325 --> 19:50.925
Yeah, every single one of them.

19:52.128 --> 19:53.595
Uh...

19:53.629 --> 19:57.632
Well, I just... You know,
they bring a lot of baggage.

19:57.667 --> 19:59.834
Well, they've also been
quite helpful at times, too.

19:59.869 --> 20:02.237
For instance, Gabe is building

20:02.271 --> 20:04.272
a treehouse with Jesus right
now for his school project.

20:04.307 --> 20:05.807
Oh, Jesus is back at school?

20:06.809 --> 20:08.777
Uh, not, not yet.

20:08.811 --> 20:11.813
Maybe we should turn our
garage into a little studio.

20:11.847 --> 20:12.881
For what?

20:12.915 --> 20:15.417
I don't know. Maybe a
detached office or something.

20:15.451 --> 20:17.932
Like you need to be more detached.

20:20.690 --> 20:23.158
You know, I should really
get this stuff put away.

20:23.192 --> 20:24.693
Oh, no, no, no, no. You sit.

20:24.727 --> 20:26.528
- You were supposed to be our guests.
- Yup.

20:26.562 --> 20:28.296
No, that's... that's not necessary...

20:28.331 --> 20:31.499
- Please.
- Uh, should we open another?

20:31.534 --> 20:33.668
Sure. Why not? Sounds good.

20:33.703 --> 20:35.170
Running low.

20:39.575 --> 20:42.677
Well, it's good to know we're
not the only couple with issues.

20:42.712 --> 20:45.013
Honey, are you sure you need more wine?

20:47.450 --> 20:49.284
Yeah, sure. I...

20:49.318 --> 20:52.120
It's, you know, the weekend.
Blow off a little steam.

20:52.154 --> 20:53.488
You should try it.

21:10.206 --> 21:11.373
Do you want to dance?

21:11.407 --> 21:12.807
No, he doesn't.

21:13.809 --> 21:15.410
He can't.

21:15.444 --> 21:16.678
Yeah, no, I, uh...

21:16.712 --> 21:18.480
I got a concussion a little while ago,

21:18.514 --> 21:19.948
so I gotta take it easy.

21:19.982 --> 21:21.149
But I'll watch you dance.

21:22.251 --> 21:23.418
Why don't you?

21:25.721 --> 21:27.222
Hey, I'm gonna find the
keg. You want a beer?

21:27.256 --> 21:29.157
Oh, yeah, sure. I'll come with you.

21:33.028 --> 21:34.629
Oh, you... On second thought,

21:34.663 --> 21:36.264
you know what, I'm
gonna wait right here.

21:36.298 --> 21:37.432
Okay.

21:40.536 --> 21:42.370
I thought you were going to the movies.

21:42.405 --> 21:43.505
And I thought you were meeting up

21:43.539 --> 21:44.572
with some friend from art class.

21:44.607 --> 21:45.673
I never said where.

21:45.708 --> 21:47.842
I didn't say what movie.

21:47.877 --> 21:49.077
Hmm.

21:49.111 --> 21:50.445
So, you came with Logan?

21:50.479 --> 21:51.880
And Jesus.

21:53.449 --> 21:54.516
You brought Jesus?

21:54.550 --> 21:56.284
He made me.

21:56.318 --> 21:58.486
Don't worry. He's not
gonna dance or anything.

21:59.889 --> 22:01.156
Oh, yeah. You sure about that?

22:03.259 --> 22:04.759
I'm gonna kill him!

22:16.138 --> 22:17.372
Thank you!

22:17.406 --> 22:19.040
We're Go, Baby, Go!

22:19.074 --> 22:21.042
All right, we're gonna take a break.

22:21.076 --> 22:23.044
If any of you rockers
out there wanna get up

22:23.078 --> 22:24.379
and jam in the meantime,

22:24.413 --> 22:25.713
come on up.

22:25.748 --> 22:27.048
And enjoy some videos

22:27.082 --> 22:29.717
of the fiercest bitches in Chula Vista:

22:29.752 --> 22:34.556
Our very own Trauma
Kweens and Traumacitas!

22:36.025 --> 22:37.258
I can't believe you brought him!

22:37.293 --> 22:39.327
- What're you doing here?
- Jesus. Hey!

22:39.361 --> 22:41.329
You can't scramble your brain like that.

22:41.363 --> 22:43.331
Hey, fresh meat. What up, baby girl?

22:43.365 --> 22:44.999
Oh, hey.

22:45.034 --> 22:47.469
Oh, hey, everybody.

22:47.503 --> 22:49.137
I... uh, this is Grace,

22:49.171 --> 22:50.939
and I'm Brandon.

22:50.973 --> 22:52.974
And we're Grandon Canyon.

22:55.010 --> 22:57.278
Uh, we're still working on the name,

22:57.313 --> 22:58.913
but, uh, we wrote this song together,

22:58.948 --> 23:00.515
and we hope you like it.

23:02.184 --> 23:04.752
♪ Feel it coming like a hurricane ♪

23:06.121 --> 23:08.857

23:11.894 --> 23:13.628

I don't know them.

23:28.179 --> 23:30.680

- Excruciating.

23:30.715 --> 23:32.749
I think they're good.

23:32.783 --> 23:35.452
- Hey, little Traumacita.
- Uh, hey.

23:35.486 --> 23:37.787
How do you know all these derby girls?

23:40.892 --> 23:42.325
I can't have friends
that you don't know?

23:42.360 --> 23:43.660
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

23:45.329 --> 23:47.664
Uh, I think she's trying to
keep you from seeing that.

23:54.138 --> 23:55.171
Are you kidding me?

23:57.074 --> 23:58.808
Logan?

23:58.843 --> 24:00.410
- Did you know about this?
- No.

24:00.444 --> 24:02.913
Hey, did you find the keg?

24:02.947 --> 24:05.048
Sorry, he's with me.

24:05.082 --> 24:08.184

24:10.154 --> 24:11.454

24:13.124 --> 24:14.925
Come on, let's go!

24:14.959 --> 24:15.959
What?

24:17.261 --> 24:19.763
It's okay. It's okay. We have a permit.

24:21.032 --> 24:22.465
What is she doing?

24:26.137 --> 24:27.137
I'm out.

24:28.372 --> 24:29.906
Is there a problem, Officers?

24:29.941 --> 24:31.408
We got some noise complaints.

24:31.442 --> 24:33.610
We got a permit to play
music until midnight.

24:33.644 --> 24:35.979
That's nice, sweetheart, but
it's time to shut it down.

24:36.013 --> 24:38.548
We don't want any trouble.

24:38.583 --> 24:39.849
Look, we don't.

24:39.884 --> 24:41.284
We're just trying to raise money here,

24:41.319 --> 24:42.819
and people paid cash to listen to music.

24:42.853 --> 24:44.387
You permitted for alcohol?

24:44.422 --> 24:46.590
We aren't selling or providing any.

24:46.624 --> 24:48.191
Some people might have
brought their own, but...

24:48.225 --> 24:49.993
Everyone here over 21?

24:50.027 --> 24:51.061
I don't know.

24:51.095 --> 24:52.162
Ximena. Here.

24:53.197 --> 24:54.898
Look, here's your permit.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.602
Whatever. Everyone
needs to leave... now.

24:58.636 --> 25:01.104
I know my rights, and you
can't ignore a valid permit.

25:01.138 --> 25:03.440
This is private property,
and you're trespassing.

25:03.474 --> 25:05.709
If you resist, you will be arrested.

25:05.743 --> 25:07.177
We'll shut it down.

25:07.211 --> 25:08.378
Ximena, get out of here!

25:08.412 --> 25:10.780
You can't get arrested.

25:10.815 --> 25:12.382
Uh, I'm parked out back.

25:13.484 --> 25:14.684
Think we should take her out.

25:15.786 --> 25:18.688
You must see a lot as a police officer.

25:18.723 --> 25:21.291
You get used to it, I guess.
Try not to bring it home.

25:21.325 --> 25:23.259
I was never great at that.

25:24.695 --> 25:27.030
I used to be a tax lawyer at a big firm.

25:27.064 --> 25:29.866
I mean, not the kind of
stress you're under, I'm sure.

25:29.900 --> 25:32.035
But, uh, I did a lot of litigation,

25:32.069 --> 25:33.803
crazy hours.

25:33.838 --> 25:36.206
After 15 years of no
life, I'd had enough.

25:37.408 --> 25:39.609
So, I feel like I overstepped

25:39.644 --> 25:40.977
when you had us over.

25:41.012 --> 25:43.213
About Jesus's situation.

25:43.247 --> 25:45.615
And I want to apologize.

25:45.650 --> 25:46.883
There's really no need.

25:46.917 --> 25:48.551
I know, it's just...

25:48.586 --> 25:50.320
If there's anything I can do...

25:51.622 --> 25:53.690
No, I... I appreciate that.

25:53.724 --> 25:56.660
Uh... honestly, I don't know what to do.

25:57.695 --> 25:59.362
His doctor doesn't.

25:59.397 --> 26:00.764
He's not very reassuring.

26:00.798 --> 26:02.065
He's got him on all these meds.

26:03.267 --> 26:04.734
What do you think

26:04.769 --> 26:08.071
about a gluten-free diet
to help reduce inflammation?

26:08.105 --> 26:09.806
I think it's a great idea.

26:09.840 --> 26:13.276
I am a total believer in a more
holistic approach to healing.

26:13.310 --> 26:15.178
What do you do now?

26:15.212 --> 26:16.579
I do estate planning,

26:16.614 --> 26:18.748
wills, and trusts for
individual clients.

26:18.783 --> 26:20.450
- I get to work from home.
- Nice.

26:21.452 --> 26:22.852
- It's a much better life.
- Mm-hmm.

26:22.887 --> 26:25.288
We got to get our house in order.

26:25.322 --> 26:28.525
Literally. We almost, uh,
almost lost it recently.

26:28.559 --> 26:29.693
I'd be happy to help with that.

26:29.727 --> 26:32.328
Be careful, with a lawyer
and a doctor next door,

26:32.363 --> 26:34.164
we might just take
advantage of you both.

26:37.935 --> 26:40.603
You know, I don't think
Tess meant anything

26:40.638 --> 26:42.706
when she said that high
school friends don't last.

26:42.740 --> 26:45.308
She tends to put her foot in
her mouth without realizing it.

26:45.342 --> 26:47.477
No offense taken. Yeah.

26:47.511 --> 26:49.345
Well, speaking of high school...

26:50.448 --> 26:53.650
can I ask what happened
between you and Tess?

26:53.684 --> 26:54.718
What do you mean?

26:57.088 --> 27:00.490
She'd kill me for telling you,
but it's always bothered her.

27:00.524 --> 27:01.791
She always wondered what she did wrong.

27:03.561 --> 27:05.395
I just... I think that, uh...

27:06.397 --> 27:07.630
I just think that we were at an age

27:07.665 --> 27:09.399
when you, you know,
you find new friends,

27:09.433 --> 27:11.034
find new interests.

27:11.068 --> 27:12.936
She didn't... she didn't do anything.

27:12.970 --> 27:15.739
It would be nice if you told her that.

27:15.773 --> 27:17.941
At some point. I mean...

27:19.977 --> 27:21.244
I think it would mean a lot to her.

27:26.183 --> 27:28.485
I've been trying to get him in
to see this specialist in LA,

27:28.519 --> 27:30.520
Doctor, uh, Rundle.

27:30.554 --> 27:32.489
But he doesn't have
any openings for a year.

27:32.523 --> 27:35.225
- Dale Rundle?
- Yeah.

27:35.259 --> 27:36.726
He and I went to Johns Hopkins together.

27:36.761 --> 27:38.328
I can totally put in a call.

27:38.362 --> 27:39.929
- Really?
- Mm-hmm. Absolutely.

27:39.964 --> 27:41.765
What are friends for, right?

27:41.799 --> 27:42.866
Thank you.

27:43.901 --> 27:46.636
Can I also say, I really
admire you and Stef.

27:46.670 --> 27:48.738
Your marriage, your family,

27:48.773 --> 27:51.641
I think it's courageous how you
live an alternative lifestyle.

27:56.380 --> 27:57.847
Where the hell is Logan?

27:57.882 --> 27:59.382
- Should I call him?
- No, no.

27:59.416 --> 28:01.484
Mariana, r... relax.

28:01.519 --> 28:04.354
We p... parked r... really f... fa...

28:06.524 --> 28:07.624
Jesus?

28:11.362 --> 28:12.896
One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi,

28:12.930 --> 28:14.397
three-Mississippi, four-Mississippi,

28:14.431 --> 28:17.267
- five-Mississippi, six...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:18.302 --> 28:20.103
Why are you counting?

28:20.137 --> 28:21.704
Moms told me to time your seizures.

28:23.808 --> 28:24.874
What?

28:30.748 --> 28:31.781
Where are we?

28:33.083 --> 28:36.252
Um... okay, we... we just left a party

28:36.287 --> 28:38.054
that you blackmailed your way into.

28:38.088 --> 28:39.989
Okay, we need to get you
home. Moms are gonna freak.

28:40.024 --> 28:43.159
No. No, no, no, no.
We cannot... tell them.

28:43.194 --> 28:44.494
They're never gonna let me out of the...

28:45.496 --> 28:46.496
house again.

28:46.530 --> 28:47.864
Well, then, maybe they shouldn't, Jesus,

28:47.898 --> 28:49.332
with how stupid you've
been acting tonight.

28:49.366 --> 28:50.400
This is a serious thing.

28:50.434 --> 28:52.168
No, I will tell them about roller derby.

28:52.203 --> 28:54.137
Go ahead. I was gonna
tell them about it anyways.

28:54.171 --> 28:55.638
Okay, then I will tell them that

28:55.673 --> 28:58.341
you brought me to a p...
party and let me dance.

29:08.403 --> 29:09.670
Um...

29:13.642 --> 29:16.277
Uh, Poppy seemed really scared

29:16.311 --> 29:17.712
about you getting arrested.

29:17.746 --> 29:19.847
I mean, for obvious reasons, but...

29:21.383 --> 29:22.783
is there something else?

29:24.286 --> 29:25.319
What do you mean?

29:25.354 --> 29:29.056
Well, I was at a party
once when the cops came,

29:29.091 --> 29:31.258
and I had get out fast

29:31.293 --> 29:32.760
'cause I was on probation.

29:34.196 --> 29:36.030
No, I'm not on probation.

29:37.265 --> 29:38.633
Okay. Sorry.

29:40.469 --> 29:41.469
I'm undocumented.

29:42.804 --> 29:45.773
My parents brought me to
the US when I was a baby.

29:46.908 --> 29:48.909
I'm supposed to be
protected under DACA...

29:49.911 --> 29:52.980
but, if you do anything wrong,

29:53.015 --> 29:54.048
like if you jaywalk,

29:55.050 --> 29:56.283
they can deport you.

29:56.318 --> 29:57.685
What's DACA?

29:57.719 --> 29:59.487
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival.

30:00.822 --> 30:03.357
Mine just expired. I'm
supposed to reapply.

30:03.392 --> 30:06.527
- You haven't?
- My parents want me to.

30:06.561 --> 30:09.897
They think it's safer for me
to show that I'm registering,

30:09.931 --> 30:11.198
you know, following the rules.

30:11.233 --> 30:13.334
But what about them?

30:13.368 --> 30:15.970
You know, we just moved. They
don't have our new address.

30:16.004 --> 30:17.304
But if I reapply...

30:18.507 --> 30:19.707
they'll know where to find us.

30:22.811 --> 30:24.178
That sucks.

30:26.048 --> 30:29.483
I'm just as much an American
as anyone in this country.

30:30.585 --> 30:32.486
Those cops were wrong.

30:32.521 --> 30:34.955
And I'm not gonna be
afraid to take a stand.

30:34.990 --> 30:37.058
Yeah, I get that.

30:37.092 --> 30:38.726
I've done that,

30:38.760 --> 30:40.361
and it got me sent to juvie.

30:42.864 --> 30:45.099
I think there's a difference between

30:45.133 --> 30:48.202
being brave and being stupid,

30:48.236 --> 30:49.737
even if you're right.

30:49.771 --> 30:51.305
Is that why you didn't
sign our petition?

30:52.674 --> 30:55.276
You think it's... stupid

30:55.310 --> 30:57.511
to fight a fight that's not yours?

30:57.546 --> 30:59.246
No. No. Um...

31:01.850 --> 31:03.884
I'm just trying to fly under the radar.

31:03.919 --> 31:05.086
By staying silent?

31:06.488 --> 31:09.824
Because that doesn't sound brave to me.

31:09.858 --> 31:12.293
You know, and I don't have that luxury.

31:12.327 --> 31:14.628
I have to fight for my
right just to be here.

31:22.037 --> 31:23.037
Yeah.

31:38.153 --> 31:39.386
Oh, my God.

31:43.492 --> 31:44.592
Uh...

31:44.626 --> 31:45.659
I had fun tonight.

31:45.694 --> 31:47.528
Really?

31:47.562 --> 31:48.629
Yeah. Really.

31:49.965 --> 31:53.067
What do you thing about
putting a set together

31:53.101 --> 31:54.468
and playing at a friendlier venue?

31:54.503 --> 31:57.638
Oh, yeah, I mean, I don't
think they'd ask us back there.

32:01.176 --> 32:02.910
Seriously, I've always wanted to do it.

32:04.346 --> 32:07.414
Of course, that means we would
have to make plans in advance,

32:07.449 --> 32:09.083
- so maybe I should forget about it...
- Oh, hey, hey,

32:09.117 --> 32:13.053
I, uh, I'm not worried
about making plans anymore.

32:13.088 --> 32:14.321
- Okay?
- Okay.

32:21.263 --> 32:22.763
I thought I heard someone out here.

32:22.798 --> 32:25.332
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, uh, B,

32:25.367 --> 32:27.768
we've got a little bit of
a situation with Cortney.

32:27.803 --> 32:28.969
Gabe is back,

32:29.004 --> 32:31.705
and you need to figure out
where she's sleeping tonight.

32:31.740 --> 32:34.642
Uh, yeah. Okay. She and
Mason can have my room,

32:34.676 --> 32:36.277
and I will sleep on the couch.

32:37.312 --> 32:39.146
Okay. It's good to see you, Grace.

32:39.181 --> 32:40.815
You, too.

32:44.019 --> 32:45.286
Cortney, your ex-girlfriend?

32:46.388 --> 32:50.324
Yeah. Uh, she needed a place to stay,

32:50.358 --> 32:52.326
but she's leaving tomorrow.

32:52.360 --> 32:54.261
I swear.

32:54.296 --> 32:55.396
Okay.

32:59.367 --> 33:01.435
Where have you been? I thought
something happened with the cops.

33:01.469 --> 33:02.469
Oh, you were worried about

33:02.504 --> 33:03.704
someone other than yourself for once?

33:04.706 --> 33:06.073
Okay, what's your problem?

33:06.107 --> 33:07.374
You're a liar, Mariana.

33:07.409 --> 33:09.944
You lied about derby.

33:09.978 --> 33:11.278
You lied about the party.

33:11.313 --> 33:13.380
You lied about Poppy to my face.

33:13.415 --> 33:14.715
What, like you never lie?

33:14.749 --> 33:17.384
Mariana, you took Jesus to a party

33:17.419 --> 33:19.787
and put him in danger just
'cause you're so desperate

33:19.821 --> 33:21.622
to get a date with Logan.

33:21.656 --> 33:23.324
At least when I lie, it's to try

33:23.358 --> 33:25.392
and do something to help someone.

33:25.427 --> 33:26.694
Don't get all high and mighty with me.

33:26.728 --> 33:28.495
Where were you when we were
trying to save the school?

33:28.530 --> 33:30.331
I'm not gonna let you turn
this around on me, okay.

33:30.365 --> 33:32.032
You can do whatever you want.

33:32.067 --> 33:34.501
Just don't be surprised when
it blows up in your face.

33:34.536 --> 33:35.603
Again.

33:46.848 --> 33:48.349
Where's Mr. Bear?

33:49.451 --> 33:52.219
Mason! I'm so sorry.

33:52.254 --> 33:53.721
Oh, it's fine.

33:53.755 --> 33:55.289
Hey, buddy.

33:55.323 --> 33:57.625
You guys should have just
stayed in here last night, huh?

33:57.659 --> 34:00.160
Oh, no, no, no. Brandon's
room was fine, honestly.

34:00.195 --> 34:02.329
We're gonna find another
place to stay tonight.

34:02.364 --> 34:05.099
How, uh, how long until
your apartment's ready?

34:05.133 --> 34:06.433
Just a week.

34:06.468 --> 34:08.235
You should stay here.

34:08.270 --> 34:10.237
- I can stay with a buddy.
- Mr. Bear.

34:10.272 --> 34:11.639
It's a lot easier for me to couch surf.

34:11.672 --> 34:13.373
- Where's Mr. Bear?
- Oh, no.

34:13.408 --> 34:15.775
I'm not gonna kick you
out of your own place.

34:15.810 --> 34:17.378
It's not really mine, so...

34:17.411 --> 34:19.013
Honestly, I mean it.

34:19.047 --> 34:21.382
- I found him!
- Oh, great!

34:23.952 --> 34:25.286
- Hey.
- Hey, Brandon.

34:25.320 --> 34:28.422
So, Cortney and Mason can stay the week.

34:28.456 --> 34:30.190
I'll crash somewhere else.

34:30.225 --> 34:31.225
Thank you.

34:32.793 --> 34:34.328
Um, is that okay?

34:34.362 --> 34:36.597
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.

34:36.630 --> 34:38.766
That's really nice of you, Gabe. Thanks.

34:44.306 --> 34:47.541
I can't believe you got called
in again on your day off.

34:47.574 --> 34:49.376
On-call...

34:49.411 --> 34:50.777
isn't a day off.

34:52.147 --> 34:53.714
Bye.

34:54.949 --> 34:56.417
- Where are you going?
- Work.

34:59.587 --> 35:00.821
Okay, so.

35:00.855 --> 35:03.223
I have two things to tell you,
so please don't interrupt me.

35:04.659 --> 35:07.928
First, I've been working
out with a roller derby team.

35:09.731 --> 35:10.731
And second...

35:11.733 --> 35:13.434
Jesus had a seizure last night.

35:21.037 --> 35:23.405
What the hell were you
thinking going to a party?

35:23.440 --> 35:25.141
Trying to hide a seizure from me, again?

35:26.443 --> 35:27.643
What are you gonna do?

35:27.677 --> 35:29.044
Are you gonna ground me?

35:29.079 --> 35:30.779
It's not like I can go anywhere, anyway.

35:32.382 --> 35:34.617
Do you know how hard I'm working,

35:34.651 --> 35:36.919
calling doctors,
reading up on treatments,

35:36.953 --> 35:38.654
trying to help you get better?

35:40.023 --> 35:41.924
And then you go and try to
pull something like this?

35:43.093 --> 35:44.426
So, no, you can't leave the house.

35:44.461 --> 35:46.262
And no one's coming over,
either. Including Emma.

35:46.296 --> 35:48.430
What? No! That is n-not fair!

35:49.432 --> 35:50.633
There are going to be consequences

35:50.667 --> 35:53.035
for the behaviors you
can control, Jesus,

35:53.069 --> 35:54.270
and lying is one of them.

35:54.304 --> 35:56.505
- You throw that and...
- And what?

35:57.774 --> 36:00.509
There are inpatient programs.

36:00.544 --> 36:02.645
Hospitals for intensive
behavioral therapy.

36:02.679 --> 36:04.647
You continue to act out like this,

36:04.681 --> 36:06.782
and that's exactly where you're going!

36:10.620 --> 36:12.154
Okay, sit on the bed.

36:13.190 --> 36:15.191
Now take off your shirt.

36:15.225 --> 36:16.458
Don't be scared.

36:17.661 --> 36:18.761
Move closer.

36:21.932 --> 36:25.034
What're you doing
here? It's your day off.

36:25.068 --> 36:27.970
Yeah, I just wanted to get
screen grabs of the faces

36:28.004 --> 36:29.872
of some of the boys in these videos.

36:29.986 --> 36:32.254
Maybe we can identify
them, maybe they...

36:32.289 --> 36:34.890
one of them will know this
creep's name and give him up.

36:35.925 --> 36:37.493
I don't think I can get
you reimbursed for that.

36:37.527 --> 36:38.694
I know, I know.

36:40.463 --> 36:41.930
You think that...

36:41.965 --> 36:43.365
You think this guy made all these?

36:44.401 --> 36:45.401
Nah, I doubt it.

36:45.435 --> 36:46.935
See, these guys share their movies,

36:46.970 --> 36:49.772
they pass them around on drives
to avoid being traced online.

36:51.007 --> 36:53.475
I wonder if Patrick Molloy
does this kind of thing.

36:54.678 --> 36:56.745
If he molests children,

36:56.780 --> 36:58.580
it's a good bet he's got
stuff like this at home.

36:58.615 --> 37:01.050
Mm. Wish we could search his apartment.

37:01.084 --> 37:02.618
You need a warrant for that.

37:03.920 --> 37:04.920
I know.

37:05.922 --> 37:09.558
So, what'd she say
about, you know, derby?

37:09.592 --> 37:11.827
Well, she's gonna talk to my mom,

37:11.861 --> 37:13.228
my other mom.

37:13.263 --> 37:14.997
But, in the meantime, I'm grounded.

37:15.031 --> 37:16.298
Yeah.

37:16.333 --> 37:17.800
You're not the only one
taking heat for that.

37:17.834 --> 37:19.435
Wait, did my moms tell your parents?

37:20.437 --> 37:22.638
Worse. My girlfriend found out.

37:23.773 --> 37:26.408
Yeah. I guess she saw me
in some girl's Insta post.

37:26.443 --> 37:27.843
She was not happy.

37:29.579 --> 37:32.481
You, uh, you have a girlfriend?

37:32.515 --> 37:35.184
Yeah, back in Baltimore.

37:35.218 --> 37:37.786
We're doing the long-distance
thing until we graduate,

37:37.821 --> 37:40.089
and then we're both hoping to
get into Syracuse next year.

37:41.191 --> 37:44.026
Really? That's... so sweet.

37:47.697 --> 37:49.331
So, my mom just, like, freaked out.

37:49.366 --> 37:51.033
Now, you can't even come over.

37:51.067 --> 37:52.735
I mean, it's bullshit!

37:52.769 --> 37:54.269
Why? What happened?

37:54.304 --> 37:56.905
I literally just went
to a party with Mariana.

37:56.940 --> 37:59.208
Well, I can understand
why they're upset.

37:59.242 --> 38:00.409
You could've gotten hurt.

38:00.443 --> 38:03.078
Well, ca... can you,
like, just be on my side?

38:03.113 --> 38:04.913
No. Not when you're going to parties

38:04.948 --> 38:05.981
and dropping out of school.

38:06.015 --> 38:08.016
Why are you doing these stupid things?

38:08.051 --> 38:10.185
You know what? Maybe it's a good thing

38:10.220 --> 38:11.220
that you can't come over

38:11.254 --> 38:12.654
'cause I don't really
wanna see you anyway.

38:58.868 --> 38:59.868
What are you doing?

39:01.938 --> 39:03.939
I'm sorry. I thought this
was my friend's place.

39:03.973 --> 39:05.774
I...

39:05.809 --> 39:06.842
No, it's not.

39:07.877 --> 39:09.111
Yeah, sorry.

39:14.384 --> 39:16.385
We need to make it
clear to the university

39:16.419 --> 39:18.887
if they won't block Shiloh
McCullen from speaking,

39:18.922 --> 39:19.922
we will.

39:19.956 --> 39:22.057
Literally, with our bodies.

39:24.360 --> 39:27.963
So, you are a human who
cares about other humans.

39:27.997 --> 39:29.398
Well, I care about keeping people

39:29.432 --> 39:30.599
from spreading hate. So...

39:32.135 --> 39:33.469
what can I do?

39:40.043 --> 39:41.443
Hi.

39:41.478 --> 39:42.611
I tried calling you.

39:45.114 --> 39:47.049
Yeah, sorry. I was in the
field. Everything okay?

39:48.051 --> 39:50.752
Oh, I know. I called your office, too.

39:50.787 --> 39:52.454
They said you were not on-call today.

39:55.291 --> 39:57.960
- Okay. I, uh...
- I don't want to hear it.

39:59.329 --> 40:01.430
Go pour yourself another glass of wine.

40:02.432 --> 40:03.465
- What?
- Go back to work.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.334
If you wanna save all the
kids in the world, fine.

40:05.368 --> 40:07.669
But we have a kid here at home

40:07.704 --> 40:08.770
who's sick...

40:10.440 --> 40:11.874
and he needs saving, too.

40:11.908 --> 40:13.509
And I feel like I'm the only who cares.

40:13.543 --> 40:14.843
I care, too.

40:14.878 --> 40:17.012
Then why do I feel like
I'm in this all by myself.

40:20.383 --> 40:22.351
You told me when you took this job,

40:22.385 --> 40:23.819
that you were not gonna disappear.

40:32.161 --> 40:33.896
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

40:33.930 --> 40:35.430
I'm here, I'm here. I'm sorry.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.067
I'm sorry.

41:06.396 --> 41:08.196
You know how much we love you, right?
