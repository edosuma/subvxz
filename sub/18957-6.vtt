Otto, what are you doing?

01:42.759 --> 01:44.294
I know you took the money.

01:44.607 --> 01:47.042
What are you talking about?

Chayton Dockery's collateral:

150,000 in cash.

Audrey, I looked. Okay?

02:02.804 --> 02:05.507
What I don't understand
is why you lied to me,

02:05.574 --> 02:07.275
made me think you
changed the combination

02:07.276 --> 02:08.877
because I'm addle-brained.

02:12.747 --> 02:14.283
I never said that.

02:14.316 --> 02:16.050
You did.

02:16.117 --> 02:18.186
Know where my mind went?

02:18.287 --> 02:19.488
You and Sam.

02:19.554 --> 02:22.123
I actually thought
that you took the money

02:22.190 --> 02:23.925
and ran off together.

02:23.992 --> 02:26.194
How could you ever think that?

02:26.295 --> 02:28.397
Pieces seemed to fit.

02:28.463 --> 02:32.734
Sam jumped ship same time
you changed the combination.

02:32.801 --> 02:35.870
So you figured, since
you cheated, I did, too?

02:40.675 --> 02:42.877

Dockery's trial lasts a couple of weeks.

06:43.926 --> 06:45.594

06:45.619 --> 06:48.627
Yeah. Well, we didn't
know you were in the game.

06:48.694 --> 06:50.896
- Give us back our shit.
- No, that's not enough.

06:50.962 --> 06:53.058
I want to know how you pulled this off.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.834
Honestly, you were just overconfident.

06:55.901 --> 06:57.578
I wrapped myself up like a candy bar.

06:57.603 --> 06:59.104
You two were so hungry, you bit.

06:59.170 --> 07:00.772

07:00.839 --> 07:02.073
Well, not technically yours

07:02.140 --> 07:03.855
because you stole it
like a bunch of hooligans.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.410
Okay. It's been fun. Let's go.

07:05.474 --> 07:06.641
Your timing is good on the lifts.

07:06.708 --> 07:08.109

07:08.176 --> 07:09.344
and put it on its feet.

07:09.411 --> 07:11.577
You, it's like all you know
how to do is spank down time.

07:11.602 --> 07:13.581
You just want to take
advantage of opportunity.

07:13.606 --> 07:15.646
Not for nothing, but it
would take somebody like you

07:15.671 --> 07:17.137
years to become a single-o.

07:17.162 --> 07:18.757
You're a single-o?

07:20.308 --> 07:21.810

07:21.835 --> 07:23.704

07:23.770 --> 07:25.438

07:25.505 --> 07:27.707
Not exactly Houdini.

07:27.708 --> 07:30.610
You know what Houdini
said about pickpockets?

07:30.711 --> 07:33.479
He said the best pickpockets are women.

07:33.546 --> 07:36.282
Why? Because they're patient.

07:37.561 --> 07:38.929
He got you?

07:42.701 --> 07:45.043
- What the fuck.
- Holy shit.

07:45.559 --> 07:47.093
Hey, you're not just a single-o.

07:47.118 --> 07:48.520

you can get around in?

07:58.504 --> 08:00.249
What if we do?

08:00.274 --> 08:01.609
Have you ever tailed anybody?

08:01.634 --> 08:03.470
Yeah, if the vic has got enough.

08:03.495 --> 08:05.178
Haven't been caught, either.

08:05.245 --> 08:07.580
Good. So I need you to
tail somebody for me.

08:07.647 --> 08:09.582
- Why do you do it?
- Why do you ask so many questions?

08:09.649 --> 08:10.984
It's $300.

08:11.051 --> 08:12.986
$300. Are you in or you out?

08:13.053 --> 08:14.254
- Out.
- Hold on.

08:14.948 --> 08:17.210
If we do this,

08:17.235 --> 08:19.025
you teach us some shit.

08:19.464 --> 08:20.861
Okay.

08:22.312 --> 08:23.393

08:25.866 --> 08:28.368

Hey. Uh,

09:16.950 --> 09:18.985
something I want to ask you.

09:19.052 --> 09:20.586
You remember Chayton Dockery?

09:20.653 --> 09:22.222
Yeah. Charged with possession

09:22.288 --> 09:24.124
of a methamphetamine precursor, right

09:24.190 --> 09:26.126
Yeah. Your grandmother
posted bond for him

09:26.192 --> 09:28.228
when I was laid up, so
I wasn't tracking it.

09:28.294 --> 09:30.303
I just realized the trial starts today.

09:30.328 --> 09:32.165
Lance is defending him.

09:32.232 --> 09:35.035
Wondering what the good
word was on the case.

09:35.101 --> 09:37.670
From what I hear, it's
a pretty solid case.

09:37.737 --> 09:40.506
Second bust. Got caught with
a shit ton of pseudo-ephedrine,

09:40.573 --> 09:42.226
and there's no reason
you would have all that

09:42.251 --> 09:43.819
unless you were making meth.

09:44.077 --> 09:45.511
Still circumstantial.

09:45.578 --> 09:48.281
Until one of his guys
rolled on him as a witness.

09:48.348 --> 09:49.883
He's going away for a long time

09:49.950 --> 09:52.518
unless Lance can pull
a rabbit out of his ass.

09:52.585 --> 09:55.887
But... if anybody could.

09:55.912 --> 09:56.880
[chuckle]

10:02.528 --> 10:05.498
Oh, excuse me. Uh, may I?

10:06.186 --> 10:08.101
I... I was hoping

10:08.168 --> 10:10.036
you could help me with
a little information.

10:10.103 --> 10:11.905
Depends what it is.

10:11.972 --> 10:14.472
Well, Ida...

10:14.497 --> 10:16.476
what a lovely name. You see,

10:16.542 --> 10:19.545
I bought some investment
property recently.

10:19.612 --> 10:21.278
I just had a fire at my home.

10:21.303 --> 10:23.206
Lost all my family heirlooms,

10:23.231 --> 10:24.851
photos of my kids and grandkids.

10:24.918 --> 10:26.219
It was absolutely awful.

10:26.286 --> 10:28.254
- Sorry to hear that.
- Why, thank you.

10:28.321 --> 10:30.556
And I managed to lose all the paperwork

10:30.623 --> 10:32.192
on the investment property, too.

10:32.258 --> 10:34.719
I can get you a copy of the deed.

10:34.744 --> 10:36.245
That would just be so wonderful.

10:36.270 --> 10:39.140
But I need to track
down the original owner.

10:39.165 --> 10:41.401
I found something on the
property I'd like to return.

10:41.467 --> 10:43.269
You can search that information online.

10:43.336 --> 10:46.072
I did. The thing is it's
listed as a shell company.

10:46.139 --> 10:48.508
I need the name and the
home address of the owner.

10:48.574 --> 10:51.544
I seem to recall that
her first name was, uh,

10:51.611 --> 10:52.801
Victoria.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.693
I can't give out personal information.

10:54.718 --> 10:57.721
Are you sure? It was a
lovely gold tennis bracelet.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.625
It had her name engraved on it.

10:59.819 --> 11:01.421
Looked to be quite valuable.

11:01.487 --> 11:03.723
If it were me, I'd
certainly want it back.

11:03.789 --> 11:06.292
Sorry, but I can't.

11:10.931 --> 11:13.133
May I just say that's a lovely sweater?

11:13.199 --> 11:15.444
Is that a brioche stitch?

11:15.499 --> 11:17.745
You know, I have tried
and tried brioche,

11:17.770 --> 11:21.139
but I always manage to drop
a stitch halfway through.

11:21.474 --> 11:23.977
Last time it happened, I actually cried.

11:24.044 --> 11:25.411
The key is to drop the stitch

11:25.478 --> 11:27.613
all the way down to
where you made the mistake

11:27.680 --> 11:29.182
and just pop that one out.

11:29.249 --> 11:31.117
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

11:31.184 --> 11:34.720
Well, your handiwork
certainly speaks for itself.

11:34.787 --> 11:35.956
Tell me,

11:36.022 --> 11:37.991
do you ever sell your work?

11:38.058 --> 11:39.759
I'd love a sweater like that.

11:39.825 --> 11:41.594
Niece just made it for me.

11:41.661 --> 11:42.963
Wanted me to wear it to work.

11:43.029 --> 11:44.965
The only reason I'm wearing this thing.

11:45.031 --> 11:47.333
Well, we all do things
for family, don't we?

11:47.400 --> 11:48.908
Tell you what.

11:48.933 --> 11:51.579
Why don't you go ahead

11:51.604 --> 11:55.141
and order a sweater
for me from your niece?

11:55.208 --> 11:57.310
It's always good to help young people

36:57.726 --> 36:59.688
Watch where you're going, ma'am.

36:59.755 --> 37:02.157
Hey, you walked into me.

37:02.224 --> 37:03.258
[sigh]

37:03.325 --> 37:04.960
Hello.

37:07.365 --> 37:09.565
Addresses are the places that she went.

37:09.632 --> 37:11.133
First one's the County Clerk's office.

37:11.199 --> 37:13.016
Then some condo
development out in Queens.

37:13.041 --> 37:14.579
Last stop was the courthouse.

37:14.604 --> 37:16.211
She chased some guy into the men's room.

37:16.236 --> 37:19.074
And I had to follow them in
there like a fucking idiot.

37:19.141 --> 37:20.943
We still got something.

37:21.796 --> 37:23.298
What did you get?

37:23.618 --> 37:25.887
She told this guy if she
didn't sell some land fast,

37:25.912 --> 37:27.247
she was going to lose the farm.

37:27.650 --> 37:30.246
Said she had to speak to Victoria.

37:30.653 --> 37:32.555
Did you get a last name? Victoria what?

37:32.960 --> 37:35.381
Did you at least get the name
of the guy she was talking to?

37:35.406 --> 37:37.342
Not just his name.

37:46.630 --> 37:47.999
You did good.

37:52.979 --> 37:55.149
So you'll teach us some shit.

37:56.187 --> 37:57.954
Hey! Hey!

37:57.979 --> 38:00.237
We help you out, and
you just blow us off?

38:00.262 --> 38:02.163
You want to learn something?
Okay, fine. First lesson.

38:02.188 --> 38:03.722
You got to drop 150 pounds.

38:03.994 --> 38:05.629
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

38:05.654 --> 38:07.121
You're meant for this. He's not.

38:07.146 --> 38:08.748
Lose the boyfriend, then we'll talk.

38:32.430 --> 38:34.676
Can I just sit here for a minute?

38:37.546 --> 38:38.903
Yeah.

38:42.138 --> 38:43.873
Is something wrong?

38:44.467 --> 38:46.629
I just don't know what to
say without sounding stupid.

38:46.695 --> 38:47.951
That's never stopped you before.

38:47.976 --> 38:49.378
Ha ha ha ha ha.

38:49.872 --> 38:52.261
Ellen and Jacob are the most
important people in my life.

38:52.286 --> 38:54.173
- I would do anything for them.
- Sure.

38:54.436 --> 38:57.960
But it... it just... it
gets hard doing it alone.

38:57.985 --> 39:00.514
No, I know. Yeah. I grew
up with a single mom.

39:00.580 --> 39:01.885
Okay. So the thing is

39:01.910 --> 39:04.889
Lance and I have been
getting close again.

39:04.914 --> 39:06.539
It was all going really well...

39:06.564 --> 39:09.564
I mean, not just the sex,
which was always good.

39:09.589 --> 39:10.590
Okay.

39:10.615 --> 39:12.487
Um, so anyway, uh,

39:12.554 --> 39:16.472
a while back, I had this
dumb dream of having a boat.

39:16.497 --> 39:17.726
I never thought in a million years

39:17.751 --> 39:19.286
he'd remember something
like that, but he did.

39:19.311 --> 39:23.248
And so now he wants to buy
one for me and the kids.

39:24.995 --> 39:26.597
He wants to buy you a boat?

39:26.622 --> 39:28.023
- Yeah.
- Wow. That's great.

39:28.048 --> 39:29.184
That's great.

39:29.261 --> 39:30.696
You know what else is great

39:30.724 --> 39:32.160
is rent and groceries and...

39:32.192 --> 39:34.215
Oh, yeah. He's always offered to help,

39:34.240 --> 39:35.641
but I always push him away.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.090
I mean, you know, I could
be a little bit proud

39:37.115 --> 39:38.317
- and, uh...
- Sure.

39:38.342 --> 39:40.444
stubborn. I wonder
where I get that from.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.469
So it sounds like, uh, ahem,

39:44.622 --> 39:46.291
sounds like you guys
are working things out.

39:46.316 --> 39:48.146
- That's great.
- Well, uh, no.

39:48.171 --> 39:51.008
Uh, remember how I told
you that he cheated on me?

39:51.423 --> 39:54.610
It was with a law clerk
from the courthouse.

39:54.635 --> 39:56.870
Tricia. She was his liaison,

39:56.895 --> 39:59.190
and I guess they liaised
in the biblical sense.

39:59.215 --> 40:00.883
Word got back to Audrey...

40:01.567 --> 40:04.270
I just don't know how
she finds everything out.

40:04.295 --> 40:06.486
Anyway, she told me,
which I'm sure she enjoyed,

40:06.558 --> 40:08.342
and I kicked him out.

40:08.367 --> 40:10.619
Oh, yeah, yeah. With
the suits and all that.

40:10.923 --> 40:12.391
I might have neglected to mention

40:12.458 --> 40:15.027
I was chasing him with a baseball bat.

40:16.595 --> 40:18.397
So you think he's doing it again?

40:18.464 --> 40:21.138
Uh, well, uh, uh...

40:21.163 --> 40:23.107
Oh, God.

40:25.040 --> 40:28.511
I saw this thing on his phone...

40:29.675 --> 40:31.176
telling him to pay...

40:31.243 --> 40:34.087
pay Victoria's rent.

40:34.847 --> 40:38.216
Why would he p-pay...
pay somebody's rent

40:38.283 --> 40:39.918
unless he was fucking her?

40:39.985 --> 40:43.922
You know? It's like
am I overreacting here?

40:43.989 --> 40:45.758
- No, I...
- Am I freaking out for no reason?

40:45.839 --> 40:48.555
I think you should follow
your instincts on that...

40:48.650 --> 40:51.204
Oh, yeah! What are those, right?

40:51.263 --> 40:52.665
Ha ha ha!

40:54.232 --> 40:56.569
Whoo.

40:56.635 --> 40:59.137
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

41:02.741 --> 41:04.477
I'm sorry. This is so stupid.

41:04.510 --> 41:05.578
It's okay.

41:05.644 --> 41:08.514
Why don't I just ask him,
for fuck's sake? I mean...

41:08.581 --> 41:10.816
that... that message can mean anything.

41:10.883 --> 41:11.884
Right?

41:11.950 --> 41:13.686
It's like I immediately just let myself,

41:13.752 --> 41:15.635
like, spin out into the dark.

41:15.660 --> 41:18.491
Oh, my God. Thank you so
much for listening, Pete.

41:18.557 --> 41:20.225
I really just needed to talk to somebody

41:20.292 --> 41:21.827
who wouldn't judge me.

41:21.894 --> 41:22.928
Thank you.

41:31.904 --> 41:33.939
I can't even believe they're
taking this case seriously.

41:34.006 --> 41:36.074
The guy threatened
me, he attacked my car,

41:36.141 --> 41:38.076
- and he knew I was a cop.
- Look, I told you

41:38.143 --> 41:39.562
they were able to get
the surveillance camera.

41:39.587 --> 41:40.729
Yeah. After I located it.

41:40.754 --> 41:42.715
And the footage covered your car.

41:42.781 --> 41:44.583
So there's no proof he did anything.

41:44.650 --> 41:45.918
All they've got right now

41:45.984 --> 41:48.353
is your word and your
cousin's against him.

41:48.571 --> 41:50.339
Look, you got a visitor.

41:51.957 --> 41:53.325
We'll talk about this later.

41:53.391 --> 41:55.193
Hi, Carly.

41:57.530 --> 41:59.965
- What did you hear?
- Nothing.

42:00.032 --> 42:02.476
Yeah, well, whatever you heard,
keep it to yourself, okay?

42:02.501 --> 42:04.169
Yeah, no problem.

42:04.236 --> 42:07.139
It's not like you haven't
kept a secret or two for me.

42:07.221 --> 42:09.290
Hey, I have something to show you.

42:09.341 --> 42:10.543
Something about Pete.

42:10.576 --> 42:12.244
Look, Carly, I've had a hell of a day,

42:12.310 --> 42:13.546
so whatever it is,

42:13.612 --> 42:15.625
it's just going to have to wait, okay?

42:15.650 --> 42:16.882
Uh...

42:17.750 --> 42:19.217
Come on. Just put it on.

42:19.284 --> 42:20.819
Vince wants you in uniform.

42:20.886 --> 42:22.420
I just need to see how it fits. Come on.

42:22.445 --> 42:24.446
If you want him in the suit,
I'll put him in the fucking suit.

42:24.471 --> 42:26.592
Thank you. That won't be necessary.

42:27.216 --> 42:30.195
All Eddie needs is a
drink to calm his ass down.

42:30.262 --> 42:31.429
Eddie doesn't need a drink.

42:31.564 --> 42:33.732
Okay, then. Karolina needs a drink.

42:39.646 --> 42:40.780
- God damn it!
- What?

42:41.173 --> 42:43.337
Shit. I nearly cut
my finger off is what.

42:43.362 --> 42:45.577
- What should I do?
- Can you just get me a Band-aid?

42:45.578 --> 42:47.187
- Where?
- From the bathroom?

42:47.212 --> 42:49.179
- Please just hurry?
- Okay.

42:51.817 --> 42:53.150
I just bought us 30 seconds.

42:53.175 --> 42:54.410
How should we spend it?

42:54.435 --> 42:56.002
Marius was here last night.

42:56.238 --> 42:57.707
- Bullshit.
- He had a gun,

42:57.732 --> 43:00.427
and he was going to kill anyone
who came between you and him.

43:00.452 --> 43:02.688
- Why didn't he?
- I made him back down.

43:03.061 --> 43:04.462
What? Why?

43:04.487 --> 43:06.640
Why? Because he would have
been killed, and so would you.

43:06.665 --> 43:08.400
And I already have
Charlie's death on my hands.

43:08.466 --> 43:09.902
We all do.

43:10.009 --> 43:12.345
Now listen, I'm working with Marius.

43:12.370 --> 43:14.151
We're going to take Vince down.

43:14.176 --> 43:16.239
You okay? How's your hand?

43:17.109 --> 43:18.243
It's still bleeding.

43:18.310 --> 43:19.778
Oh, thank you.

43:20.455 --> 43:21.623
Here you go.

43:21.761 --> 43:24.778
Thanks. Well, the good news is

43:24.803 --> 43:26.672
Eddie says he's ready to deal.

43:28.086 --> 43:29.655
Right, Eddie?

44:03.656 --> 44:05.223
What the hell are you doing?

44:06.993 --> 44:08.327
Sorry. You are?

44:08.352 --> 44:10.245
The manager. And you are?

44:10.278 --> 44:12.831
Oh, yeah. Hi. Uh, Keith Conway.

44:12.856 --> 44:14.733
I'm, uh, in town for the, uh,

44:14.800 --> 44:15.868
for the [mumble] Museum.

44:15.934 --> 44:17.269
I rented this place online.

44:17.326 --> 44:19.166
There was supposed to be
a key under the mat for me,

44:19.191 --> 44:20.399
but I couldn't find it.

44:20.424 --> 44:21.674
Rented it from who?

44:21.740 --> 44:23.842
From, uh, uh, Victoria...

44:23.909 --> 44:27.579
uh, Victoria Jama...
Janet... Jemmett. Jemmett.

44:27.680 --> 44:28.947
Did you ever meet her?

44:29.014 --> 44:30.315
No.

44:30.802 --> 44:32.150
That makes two of us.

44:32.217 --> 44:34.120
- What do you mean?
- Never laid eyes on her.

44:34.145 --> 44:35.721
There's no furniture in the place.

44:35.746 --> 44:37.648
Doesn't look like she ever moved in.

44:38.757 --> 44:40.292
You've got to be kidding me.

44:41.727 --> 44:43.544
What, do you think she ripped me off?

44:43.584 --> 44:45.092
That's between you and her.

44:45.117 --> 44:46.118
Excuse me, sir.

44:46.143 --> 44:47.478
Is there any contact information

44:47.503 --> 44:49.425
you could give me so
I could track her down?

44:49.567 --> 44:51.487
Look, she pays on time every month,

44:51.512 --> 44:52.963
cash, through the mail slot.

44:52.988 --> 44:54.122
As long as that happens,

44:54.189 --> 44:56.007
owners don't care about much else.

44:56.032 --> 44:59.235
Okay. Thank you, you fucking asshole.

45:00.025 --> 45:01.213
Whew.

45:01.279 --> 45:02.580
Hey.

45:02.715 --> 45:04.249
Hey.

45:06.885 --> 45:09.988
- I need to talk to you about something.
- Whatever it is, it can wait.

45:10.325 --> 45:12.660
I'm in a very bad mood.

45:13.554 --> 45:15.060
I think your mood's going to get worse.

45:15.127 --> 45:16.494
Can we talk about it later?

45:16.561 --> 45:18.063
Pete's a criminal.

45:27.917 --> 45:29.254
[door closes]

45:34.304 --> 45:36.119
I know who has the money.

45:36.590 --> 45:37.791
Who?

45:38.215 --> 45:40.217
Julia's ex.

45:40.720 --> 45:42.089
The lawyer.

45:43.379 --> 45:47.165
He's got Audrey on
the hook for 175 grand.

45:47.459 --> 45:48.927
[scoff]

45:48.994 --> 45:51.764
You have any idea what
kind of con he's running?

45:53.265 --> 45:56.534
From what I can see, I think
it's the Spanish prisoner.

45:56.601 --> 45:58.336
And you want to do what?

45:59.772 --> 46:01.874
I want to do a rollover.

46:09.221 --> 46:10.457
[phone beeps]

46:13.518 --> 46:16.654
Joseph, it's Marjorie.
Listen, Marius is here.

46:16.789 --> 46:18.256
We need your help...

46:19.447 --> 46:20.982
We could run a badger game.

46:21.007 --> 46:24.401
Now, we worked a great one
in Philly about ten years ago.

46:24.426 --> 46:25.697
No, the timing's wrong.

46:25.798 --> 46:27.099
He's making a play for Julia.

46:27.165 --> 46:28.533
I don't think he's stupid enough

46:28.600 --> 46:29.868
to fuck that up with another woman.

46:29.935 --> 46:31.469
Well, we can't count on it anyway.

46:31.494 --> 46:34.537
- No.
- I keep thinking another land con.

46:34.572 --> 46:36.374
But maybe he smells that?

46:36.921 --> 46:38.443
Yeah, or maybe he's so sure of himself,

46:38.510 --> 46:40.437
- he wouldn't see it coming.
- Yeah.

46:40.540 --> 46:43.548
Hubris. Nothing lays a man lower.

46:43.615 --> 46:44.865
Almost nothing.

46:44.890 --> 46:46.391
What if we salt it?

46:46.819 --> 46:48.821
Uh, salting could work.

46:48.854 --> 46:51.223
Um, hard to pull off,
giving he knows you.

46:51.289 --> 46:53.258
Yeah, or maybe that's why it works...

46:53.325 --> 46:57.095
because he wouldn't suspect
me of trying to con him

46:57.162 --> 47:00.032
if he's busy suspecting me
of trying to fuck my cousin.

47:01.353 --> 47:02.572
Are you?

47:03.969 --> 47:05.612
I don't have a cousin.

47:06.033 --> 47:08.206
Joseph: If she's hot,
then why not, right?

47:08.273 --> 47:09.541
It's not like she's really your cousin.

47:09.607 --> 47:11.109
All right, stay on topic.

47:12.320 --> 47:14.785
If you're going to put
together a salt con this fast,

47:14.810 --> 47:16.812
you're gonna need someone
who's done it before.

47:17.382 --> 47:18.550
Porter.

47:20.285 --> 47:22.888
No, he thinks I got his brother killed.

47:22.971 --> 47:25.194
Well, he's wrong.

47:25.858 --> 47:28.424
- I'm not so sure about that.
- Well, I am.

47:28.892 --> 47:32.561
Hey, look, if Marjorie
can get past it, then...

47:32.597 --> 47:33.866
Past it?

47:33.932 --> 47:35.868
I'm saving up all my anger

47:35.934 --> 47:37.870
for the man who pulled the trigger.

47:40.129 --> 47:41.998
I'm going to make coffee.

47:42.540 --> 47:44.042
Anyway, from what I heard,

47:44.109 --> 47:45.978
Porter isn't doing so great.

48:03.083 --> 48:04.618
Oh, my God.

48:04.897 --> 48:06.899
[laughing]

48:06.932 --> 48:09.847
You scared the shit out of me.

48:19.077 --> 48:20.512
Something wrong?

48:29.447 --> 48:31.623
We know you're a criminal, Pete.

48:34.369 --> 48:35.904
Is that you?

48:42.194 --> 48:44.196
Is it true, Pete?

48:44.584 --> 48:46.118
Did you do time?

48:54.612 --> 48:55.948
Yes.

49:09.461 --> 49:11.730
And that's exactly why you need me.
