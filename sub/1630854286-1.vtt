WEBVTT

01:34.027 --> 01:37.303
And don't come inside
until the screaming starts.

02:43.734 --> 02:45.734
Sit.

02:51.544 --> 02:53.511
Commune...

02:53.546 --> 02:55.843
or curse?

02:55.878 --> 02:58.714
Curse.

02:58.749 --> 03:02.388
Payment first.

03:08.924 --> 03:11.562
Blood now.

03:16.569 --> 03:18.305
And...

03:20.133 --> 03:21.902
what fate...

03:24.236 --> 03:27.908
for the owner of this blood?

03:31.276 --> 03:35.245
I want the devil himself
to take possession of her,

03:35.280 --> 03:39.216
for both to be locked
in hell together, forever.

03:40.593 --> 03:43.396
Well...

03:43.431 --> 03:45.959
the devil himself

03:45.994 --> 03:49.897
never takes possession.

03:49.932 --> 03:54.572
He sends one of his legions.

03:54.607 --> 03:55.771
A demon?

03:55.806 --> 03:57.410
Mm-hmm.

03:57.445 --> 04:00.413
And it will be
whenever he so chooses,

04:00.448 --> 04:02.580
unless...

04:04.650 --> 04:06.177
What?

04:07.620 --> 04:09.818
It'll cost double.

04:09.853 --> 04:12.084
I'll get it, tonight.

04:12.119 --> 04:13.987
As soon as we finish,

04:14.022 --> 04:17.430
go to this person quickly.

04:17.465 --> 04:21.467
She may be violently ill
and have supernatural strength.

04:23.702 --> 04:25.834
You must take this knife

04:25.869 --> 04:29.838
and wait for the point
of no return,

04:29.873 --> 04:34.007
when the demon
has come too far.

04:34.042 --> 04:36.779
How do I know when that is?

04:36.814 --> 04:41.850
You'll see the demon's
three fingers

04:41.885 --> 04:48.461
emerging from the mouth
of the accursed.

04:48.496 --> 04:51.959
Carve a crucifix

04:51.994 --> 04:55.468
into the flesh of the throat,

04:55.503 --> 04:59.472
above the chest.

04:59.507 --> 05:04.169
Are you ready
to gaze into hell?

05:09.880 --> 05:11.682
Yes.

05:28.261 --> 05:29.535
Mm.

05:33.365 --> 05:37.070
Come and gaze at his blaze

05:37.105 --> 05:39.842
of fire,

05:39.877 --> 05:46.519
where winged embers rise

05:46.554 --> 05:49.522
to kindling choir!

05:49.557 --> 05:53.350
He is darkness.

05:53.385 --> 05:58.355
He is whispers.

05:58.390 --> 06:02.359
He is sweet

06:02.394 --> 06:07.100
inside your heart.

06:07.135 --> 06:09.707
He is heat.

06:09.742 --> 06:14.107
He is smoke...

06:15.781 --> 06:20.377
...in your throat.

06:24.790 --> 06:26.383
What now?

06:26.418 --> 06:30.959
We wait for the devil
to relight his candle.

06:30.994 --> 06:33.764
Watch close my face,

06:33.799 --> 06:36.569
for the face of the accursed
will soon take mine

06:36.604 --> 06:38.395
but for a moment.

06:38.430 --> 06:41.805
He...

06:41.840 --> 06:44.335
is real.

06:45.646 --> 06:47.811
He...

06:49.012 --> 06:52.145
is imagined.

06:52.180 --> 06:53.784
He...

06:53.819 --> 06:58.415
is stationed at

06:58.450 --> 07:00.923
the seal.

07:00.958 --> 07:01.990
Ahh...

07:05.457 --> 07:07.798
I...

07:07.833 --> 07:10.603
I hear...

07:10.638 --> 07:13.001
a fly.

07:16.677 --> 07:20.173
But I... I don't...

07:20.208 --> 07:22.175
I don't see one.

07:25.312 --> 07:28.819
Do... do you hear it?

07:31.560 --> 07:33.626
Only...

07:33.661 --> 07:35.793
the accursed...

07:35.828 --> 07:38.026
hears the fly!

07:48.500 --> 07:49.840
Where...

07:49.875 --> 07:52.139
did you get...

07:52.174 --> 07:53.338
the blood?!

07:53.373 --> 07:56.143
Where did you get
this blood?!

07:56.178 --> 07:59.410
My daughter bled you
while you slept, witch!

08:03.691 --> 08:05.482
My name is Mary Lynn Crandon,

08:05.517 --> 08:08.056
and this is
for my husband Thomas!

08:27.946 --> 08:29.209
Sadie!

08:56.909 --> 08:58.744
Next time we burn it down.

11:46.914 --> 11:50.113
Elly, you need me to stay?

11:50.148 --> 11:52.753
No, you go. I'm fine.

11:54.988 --> 11:56.284
Fine.

11:58.255 --> 11:59.925
Let's go with that.

12:01.489 --> 12:04.897
So, are you going
to stay in town awhile?

12:04.932 --> 12:08.560
Uh... probably
until I sell this place.

12:08.595 --> 12:12.564
I want to get back to Haiti,
they need volunteers.

12:12.599 --> 12:15.105
Lots of junk to clear out,
keep me busy till then.

12:15.140 --> 12:17.107
True.

12:17.142 --> 12:19.571
I can stop by tomorrow,
help you out.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.474
You don't have to do that.

12:21.509 --> 12:22.915
I want to.

12:22.950 --> 12:25.445
I can bring wine,
like old times.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.788
Great. Sounds good.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.960
Hey, Beth?

12:34.995 --> 12:38.095
Thank you
for coming to the service.

12:38.130 --> 12:39.932
It means a lot.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.296

15:47.550 --> 15:49.682
I'm sorry,
I'm always losing it.

15:49.717 --> 15:51.783
I've been cleaning nonstop.

15:51.818 --> 15:53.950
<i>Okay, well, since</i>

15:53.985 --> 15:55.160

No. Why?

16:00.332 --> 16:02.134
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

16:02.169 --> 16:05.830
<i>The news, like,</i>
<i>it's pretty rotten.</i>

16:05.865 --> 16:07.304
What's going on?

16:07.339 --> 16:10.175
<i>They're cutting off</i>
<i>all foreign aid to Haiti.</i>

16:10.210 --> 16:14.311
<i>I mean, no one is going</i>
<i>in or out, nobody.</i>

16:14.346 --> 16:15.906
Oh, shit.

16:17.349 --> 16:19.745
<i>Sorry.</i>

16:23.685 --> 16:25.322
So, I called my team leader.

16:25.357 --> 16:26.818
He said
the State Department issued

16:26.853 --> 16:28.820
a level 4 travel advisory.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.064
Level 4, that's bad, right?

16:31.099 --> 16:33.990
Right. It means I can't
get a flight back.

16:34.025 --> 16:36.168
I mean, the worst part is
those people still need help,

16:36.203 --> 16:37.697
and we're just abandoning them.

16:37.732 --> 16:39.336
People need help
here, too, Elly.

16:39.371 --> 16:41.371
We're having a blood drive
at St. Luke's tomorrow.

16:41.406 --> 16:42.867
You could start with that.

16:42.902 --> 16:44.000
Yeah, sign me up.

16:44.035 --> 16:47.003
Really? Now, that is
the Elly I know.

16:47.038 --> 16:48.840
How about we do just
one more of these big boxes

16:48.875 --> 16:50.347
and then pop open
the<i> Vin de Luxe,</i>

16:50.382 --> 16:51.711
-since this is boring.
-Okay.

16:51.746 --> 16:52.778
Yes!

16:54.584 --> 16:55.781
Elly.

16:58.126 --> 17:00.016
Mrs. Dudley, hi.

17:00.051 --> 17:02.018
I'm sorry for your loss.

17:02.053 --> 17:03.591
Thank you.

17:03.626 --> 17:05.230
It's nice of you to stop by.

17:05.265 --> 17:08.860
I only came by to give you back
the spare key.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.367
I...

17:10.402 --> 17:13.238
I'm sorry I wasn't
able to make the service.

17:13.273 --> 17:16.076
It's really all right,
don't worry about it.

17:17.574 --> 17:20.245
Looks like you're busy.

17:20.280 --> 17:22.808
Yeah, we are.

17:27.749 --> 17:30.618
I was the one
who found your mother.

17:32.292 --> 17:34.259
Mrs. Dudley,
do you want to come inside?

17:34.294 --> 17:37.823
I wouldn't have gone inside
if I hadn't heard the music.

17:39.299 --> 17:42.432
Hey, El, where are the boxes
from the attic?

17:42.467 --> 17:44.060
Uh, check the kitchen.

17:44.095 --> 17:46.898
I'm sorry... what music?

17:46.933 --> 17:50.803
That old song she liked
to play, you know the one.

17:50.838 --> 17:53.971
I was passing by on my way
to church when I heard it.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.643
It was a record.

17:57.108 --> 17:59.845
It should have been
skipping, but...

18:01.453 --> 18:02.815
It just...

18:02.850 --> 18:06.258
<i>♪ And I'll never leave-- ♪</i>

18:06.293 --> 18:08.920
I just...

18:08.955 --> 18:12.462
Mrs. Dudley, I'm so sorry.

18:12.497 --> 18:14.464
You were always a really great
neighbor to us,

18:14.499 --> 18:16.598
especially after my dad left.

18:16.633 --> 18:18.633
Do you mean when he ran off
with that whore?

18:20.131 --> 18:23.671
Why did you
run off on her, too, Elly?

18:23.706 --> 18:25.475
She was sick.

18:25.510 --> 18:27.642
She had nobody.

18:27.677 --> 18:29.281
If you had been here,

18:29.316 --> 18:31.448
I wouldn't have had
to go through that horror.

18:31.483 --> 18:34.011
I'm sorry for what you saw,
but you have no right

18:34.046 --> 18:36.453
to lecture me
about my choices.

18:36.488 --> 18:37.949
Hey! Okay...

18:37.984 --> 18:40.655
I think you'd better
go now, Mrs. Dudley.

18:42.230 --> 18:45.121
I haven't slept for days!

18:45.156 --> 18:48.124
I lie in bed at night.

18:48.159 --> 18:50.500
I keep seeing her face!

18:53.505 --> 18:56.308
I can't believe
she slapped me.

18:56.343 --> 18:59.509
No one would believe
that she slapped you.

18:59.544 --> 19:01.511
She's right.

19:01.546 --> 19:03.139
About what?

19:03.174 --> 19:04.712
Maybe I should have been here.

19:04.747 --> 19:07.847
Elly, you were here.
You stuck around.

19:07.882 --> 19:09.750
Yeah, until I didn't.

19:13.052 --> 19:16.724
I hated my dad
after he left her.

19:16.759 --> 19:19.056
Then I did the same thing.

19:19.091 --> 19:23.929
Well, now, your dad walked out
on his wife and his daughter.

19:25.405 --> 19:27.097
That is not at all
the same thing.

19:28.738 --> 19:31.508
All you did was
go out of this town

19:31.543 --> 19:32.839
and went and lived your life.

19:32.874 --> 19:34.346
That's normal, that is healthy.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.744
That is nothing
to feel guilty about.

19:41.553 --> 19:44.356
Shoot, that's my ride.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.215
Should I cancel?

19:46.250 --> 19:48.756
No. No, you've got
an early start.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.364
But I am gonna see you

19:52.399 --> 19:53.860
at the blood drive
tomorrow, right?

19:53.895 --> 19:55.400
-Yes, I'll be there.
-Like seriously.

19:55.435 --> 19:57.028
You're gonna show up,
gonna be there?

19:57.063 --> 19:58.733
-I'm really gonna be there.
-Okay.

20:00.770 --> 20:02.605
You're not your dad

20:02.640 --> 20:06.378
and you're not your mom either.

20:06.413 --> 20:10.712
Okay? You're you,
and you're a good person.

20:10.747 --> 20:12.142
Remember that?

22:43.966 --> 22:46.538
Gamble residence,
Elly speaking.

22:46.573 --> 22:48.573
<i> You must be the nurse.</i>

22:50.137 --> 22:51.103
Who's this?

22:51.138 --> 22:53.369
<i>My name is Alma Whitelorn.</i>

22:53.404 --> 22:56.207
<i>I'm calling</i>
<i>on behalf of Ms. Ambrose.</i>

22:56.242 --> 22:58.715
<i>She needs a carer.</i>

22:58.750 --> 23:00.750
<i>Your mother recommended you.</i>

23:02.413 --> 23:04.050
My mother? When?

23:04.085 --> 23:07.317
<i>Last week.</i>
<i>We spoke on the telephone.</i>

23:10.157 --> 23:11.596
I'm sorry...

23:11.631 --> 23:14.060
There must be a mistake.
I've been away.

23:14.095 --> 23:16.227
I only came home
a couple of days ago.

23:16.262 --> 23:18.570
<i>Your mother said you'd be</i>
<i>coming home next week</i>

23:18.605 --> 23:20.132
<i>and to try you then.</i>

23:20.167 --> 23:21.969
<i>Is this a bad time?</i>

23:30.441 --> 23:34.487
Do you think she had it
all planned out?

23:34.522 --> 23:36.786
Um, I don't know.

23:36.821 --> 23:37.952
Maybe.

23:39.989 --> 23:41.494
Ooh.

23:41.529 --> 23:43.287
What happened here?

23:43.322 --> 23:44.794
Oh, um...

23:46.028 --> 23:47.632
Not long after my dad left,

23:47.667 --> 23:49.766
I woke up
in the middle of the night

23:49.801 --> 23:53.330
and... my mom was
sitting there with a syringe

23:53.365 --> 23:55.475
and a little glass vial
and...

23:57.369 --> 23:58.940
she took my blood.

23:58.975 --> 24:00.942
Were you sick?

24:00.977 --> 24:02.977
I don't think so.

24:03.012 --> 24:05.144
That's fucked up.

24:05.179 --> 24:08.180
Maybe it's why
I became a nurse.

24:08.215 --> 24:13.119
Speaking of you
and your nursing,

24:13.154 --> 24:14.659
you gonna take that job?

24:14.694 --> 24:17.695
I don't know.
I could use the money.

24:17.730 --> 24:20.456
The aid program was helping me
to pay off my nursing school.

24:20.491 --> 24:22.535
I'm been kind of in danger
of defaulting.

24:22.570 --> 24:25.032
What about the sale
of your mom's house?

24:25.067 --> 24:27.496
Turns out she was
in some serious debt.

24:27.531 --> 24:30.642
Okay, well, for once,
I cannot judge your mother,

24:30.677 --> 24:32.842
because we both know
that I know about debt.

24:34.505 --> 24:36.681
But I do think
you should take that job.

24:36.716 --> 24:39.310
The change of scenery
would do you a lot of good.

24:39.345 --> 24:40.817
Yeah. But it's out
in the sticks

24:40.852 --> 24:42.313
and I don't have a car.

24:42.348 --> 24:46.317
Okay, well, as per
my last email, I have a car.

24:46.352 --> 24:48.055
It's a piece of shit,
but it's a car.

24:48.090 --> 24:50.530
I'll drive, you get the gas.

24:56.428 --> 24:59.330
You think she did it
to punish me?

24:59.365 --> 25:00.672
Like trap me?

25:00.707 --> 25:02.674
You're not trapped.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.874
You're gonna sell
that musty old house

25:04.909 --> 25:07.547
and... live your life.

25:11.619 --> 25:13.685
The phone call was so weird.

25:13.720 --> 25:16.347
I don't even know how
my mom knew these people

25:16.382 --> 25:19.790
or... why she recommended me.

25:21.585 --> 25:24.520
<i>There, all done.</i>

25:32.299 --> 25:34.937
Shhh!

25:34.972 --> 25:37.071
Go back to sleep, Eleanor.

26:38.200 --> 26:40.772
<i> Eleanor!</i>

26:40.807 --> 26:42.301
<i>Get in here!</i>

26:48.639 --> 26:50.782
Mother?

26:50.817 --> 26:52.982
<i>Where were you?</i>

26:53.017 --> 26:54.346
I told you, I...

26:54.381 --> 26:57.118
<i>Where... were... you?</i>

26:57.153 --> 26:59.186
I was volunteering...

27:56.883 --> 27:59.015
Look at me!

28:02.284 --> 28:03.888
Do you smell that?

28:03.923 --> 28:06.583
I pissed myself.

28:06.618 --> 28:07.859
And nobody came to help.

28:07.894 --> 28:09.586
Stop!

28:09.621 --> 28:12.765
You should have seen that
nosy old bitch, Mrs. Dudley.

28:12.800 --> 28:14.525
"Help! Somebody, come!"

28:14.560 --> 28:18.034
She just opened up her big
stupid mouth and...

28:28.574 --> 28:30.376
Elly, come on.

28:30.411 --> 28:32.378
It's that crazy neighbor lady,

28:32.413 --> 28:35.546
she just smacked this idea
into your head.

28:35.581 --> 28:37.713
No, it was real.

28:40.487 --> 28:44.621
I mean, it felt real.

28:45.591 --> 28:47.624
Well, maybe you should...

28:47.659 --> 28:49.065
you know.

28:49.100 --> 28:50.803
What?

28:50.838 --> 28:52.299
See someone?

28:52.334 --> 28:54.939
Talk about it, professionally.

28:54.974 --> 28:56.468
Like a psychiatrist?

28:58.142 --> 28:59.273
Yeah, like a...

28:59.308 --> 29:01.275
exactly like a psychiatrist.

29:01.310 --> 29:03.112
Great, then I'll officially
turn into her.

29:03.147 --> 29:06.115
That's not possible, you're
never gonna become your mother.

29:06.150 --> 29:09.151
I'm just...

29:09.186 --> 29:11.417
You're grieving,
and this isn't my line.

29:11.452 --> 29:13.320
I don't know what to do
with this stuff, but...

29:13.355 --> 29:16.290
you can stay with me
for as long as it takes.

29:19.361 --> 29:20.833
<i>♪ You're my ♪</i>

29:20.868 --> 29:25.937
<i>♪ Baby girl ♪</i>

29:25.972 --> 29:28.467
<i>♪ And I'll always ♪</i>

29:28.502 --> 29:32.977
<i>♪ Love you ♪</i>

29:34.343 --> 29:36.178
<i>♪ You-- ♪</i>

29:36.213 --> 29:39.346
Isn't that the record
your mom used to always play?

29:39.381 --> 29:42.019
She always said
it was our song.

29:42.054 --> 29:44.956
It was playing
when Mrs. Dudley found her.

29:44.991 --> 29:47.453
Then throw it in a box

29:47.488 --> 29:49.323
or against the wall.

29:49.358 --> 29:51.325
I don't think I can do that.

29:53.032 --> 29:54.966
But I've decided
I'm going to take the job,

29:55.001 --> 29:56.968
if you'll still drive me.

29:57.003 --> 30:00.972
Hey, hey, I am so down
to do anything

30:01.007 --> 30:02.974
that involves us
getting the fuck out of here.

30:03.009 --> 30:04.569
-Okay.
-Okay.

31:14.806 --> 31:15.981
What?

31:17.479 --> 31:19.149
Weirdly familiar.

31:20.251 --> 31:22.251
<i> Take my hand.</i>

31:28.919 --> 31:32.558
Girl, are you, like, 100% sure
you still wanna do this?

31:32.593 --> 31:34.725
This is really
in the middle of nowhere.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.628
Yeah, I'll be fine.

31:39.468 --> 31:40.896
Creepy.

31:40.931 --> 31:44.108
Was she always
standing right there?

31:47.773 --> 31:49.146
Must be Alma.

31:49.181 --> 31:51.775
Yay.

31:51.810 --> 31:53.183
Alma.

31:58.652 --> 32:01.422
Miss Campbell. Hmm.

32:01.457 --> 32:03.655
I'm Alma Whitelorn.

32:03.690 --> 32:06.097
In charge
of the Ambrose estate.

32:06.132 --> 32:08.000
We spoke on the telephone.

32:08.035 --> 32:09.496
You're late.

32:09.531 --> 32:11.300
Oh, yeah, sorry.

32:11.335 --> 32:14.435
The drive just took
a bit longer than we expected.

32:14.470 --> 32:16.272
This is my friend Beth.

32:16.307 --> 32:17.669
Hi.

32:17.704 --> 32:19.506
The job's for one person.

32:19.541 --> 32:22.641
Oh, I'm just...
I'm just the driver.

32:22.676 --> 32:26.216
We're a little behind.
If you'll follow me.

32:28.352 --> 32:29.681
Wow.

32:39.198 --> 32:41.132
Refrigerator, oven.

32:41.167 --> 32:43.662
There's no dishwasher
and no microwave.

32:43.697 --> 32:45.499
I'm sure you can make do.

32:45.534 --> 32:46.698
Yeah, no problem.

32:46.733 --> 32:49.536
Help yourself to some fruit.

32:49.571 --> 32:51.142
You can use the fireplace.

32:51.177 --> 32:53.474
The nights have been
growing cold here.

32:53.509 --> 32:55.674
A reliable landline.

32:55.709 --> 32:59.975
You have my phone number
in case of an emergency.

33:00.010 --> 33:02.846
I'll introduce you
to your patient now.

33:24.771 --> 33:26.573
Don't mind if I do.

33:26.608 --> 33:28.839
I made arrangements
for Ms. Ambrose

33:28.874 --> 33:30.214
to have the best
possible care,

33:30.249 --> 33:31.842
but they couldn't provide her

33:31.877 --> 33:33.382
with a private room
until Monday.

33:33.417 --> 33:35.846
A bed in a ward
simply wouldn't do.

33:35.881 --> 33:38.013
Ms. Ambrose
is a private woman.

33:38.048 --> 33:40.587
Does she have any family?

33:40.622 --> 33:42.017
A daughter.

33:42.052 --> 33:44.723
But she went away
some time ago.

33:44.758 --> 33:46.857
Where did she go?

33:46.892 --> 33:50.234
Your job is Ms. Ambrose.

34:07.649 --> 34:10.221
A precaution,
on the off chance

34:10.256 --> 34:12.718
Ms. Ambrose were
to become responsive,

34:12.753 --> 34:14.555
but that won't happen.

34:14.590 --> 34:17.888
However, I must stress that
you do not leave these grounds

34:17.923 --> 34:19.890
until the ambulance arrives
on Monday,

34:19.925 --> 34:23.630
and I won't tolerate
any alcohol on the premises

34:23.665 --> 34:24.796
or any visitors.

34:24.831 --> 34:27.062
Ms. Ambrose is a private--

34:27.097 --> 34:28.668
Private woman? Yeah.

34:31.475 --> 34:33.442
I'll show you to your room now.

35:06.312 --> 35:08.477
Perfect.

35:08.512 --> 35:12.448
I wanted to ask you
about your time volunteering.

35:12.483 --> 35:14.010
Yeah, of course.

35:14.045 --> 35:16.683
Perhaps I misread
the dates on your résumé,

35:16.718 --> 35:18.685
but it seems you were
caring for your mother

35:18.720 --> 35:20.489
at the same time, correct?

35:22.328 --> 35:23.954
Yeah, um...

35:23.989 --> 35:26.957
My experience was
better suited to volunteering--

35:26.992 --> 35:29.828
It's not easy
caring for family, is it?

35:31.997 --> 35:34.635
No, it's not.

35:34.670 --> 35:37.242
So, is this
the daughter's room?

35:38.575 --> 35:40.509
There are no other bedrooms.

35:42.381 --> 35:43.974
I really must get going.

35:44.009 --> 35:46.680
If you have any further
questions, I'll see you inside.

35:51.885 --> 35:54.149
She is a real charmer.

35:54.184 --> 35:57.152
Beth, can you
just not say anything else?

35:57.187 --> 35:59.825
Have you met me?

35:59.860 --> 36:02.333
Okay, fine, no problem.
I'll go get some air.

36:02.368 --> 36:04.566
I can't breathe
in here, anyway.

36:04.601 --> 36:08.240
Oh, yeah, and I would take
the couch if I were you.

36:08.275 --> 36:09.505
Why?

36:09.540 --> 36:10.902
What if the daughter
comes back

36:10.937 --> 36:12.541
and finds Goldilocks
in her bed?

36:31.430 --> 36:32.759
How is the apple?

36:32.794 --> 36:34.189
Mm.

36:34.224 --> 36:35.399
Biblical.

36:36.897 --> 36:38.193
She's crazy.

36:38.228 --> 36:39.568
You're fuckin' crazy
for staying.

36:39.603 --> 36:41.801
Well, she's not
gonna stay with me.

36:43.310 --> 36:46.135
Okay,
there she is again. Hello.

36:47.644 --> 36:50.414
Half up front as agreed.
The rest on Monday.

36:50.449 --> 36:52.042
Thank you.

36:52.077 --> 36:53.780
And you'll be leaving soon?

36:53.815 --> 36:56.420
Yep. Right after you do.

37:00.151 --> 37:01.392
Um, Alma.

37:01.427 --> 37:05.825
Do you know how my mother
knew Ms. Ambrose?

37:08.434 --> 37:11.402
I believe they were
old acquaintances, no?

37:11.437 --> 37:12.964
Uh... maybe.

37:12.999 --> 37:14.933
I'm not really sure.

37:14.968 --> 37:17.771
Well, if that's all,
I'll say good afternoon then.

37:19.346 --> 37:20.774
Thanks for everything.

37:24.274 --> 37:26.076
Yeah, I rest my case.

37:38.860 --> 37:40.431
All right, get it all out.

37:40.466 --> 37:43.093
Okay, for openers,
you don't have a car.

37:43.128 --> 37:44.765
That's why you drove me.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.437
Which is exactly how I know
you don't have a car.

37:46.472 --> 37:48.835
Also, you barely know
how to use a cell phone,

37:48.870 --> 37:50.265
so, what if something happens?

37:50.300 --> 37:52.674
You're in the middle
of nowhere.

37:52.709 --> 37:54.346
You would be
literally stranded.

37:54.381 --> 37:55.842
I'm looking
after a comatose woman

37:55.877 --> 37:57.679
in a country cabin.

37:57.714 --> 38:00.275
I mean, look at this place,
it's like an Airbnb.

38:00.310 --> 38:02.519
Yeah, super nice Airbnb,

38:02.554 --> 38:05.181
even comes with its own
little check-in receptionist

38:05.216 --> 38:07.018
who's also married to Satan.

38:07.053 --> 38:08.657
And then the host
stays with you in a coma.

38:08.692 --> 38:10.285
Five-star review.

38:10.320 --> 38:12.661
You're the one who talked me
into taking this job.

38:12.696 --> 38:14.861
Yeah, because I thought you
needed a change of scenery.

38:14.896 --> 38:16.995
-Yeah, this is it.
-That's not what I meant.

38:17.030 --> 38:18.634
-Alma's gone now.
-Could you just stop?

38:18.669 --> 38:20.328
Shut up, just stop!

38:20.363 --> 38:22.671
Look me in the eye and tell me
you're not taking this job

38:22.706 --> 38:24.134
just because
of you and your mom,

38:24.169 --> 38:26.037
'cause there are
a lot of similarities here

38:26.072 --> 38:27.676
I can't ignore.

38:30.714 --> 38:33.143
Listen, I'm staying.

38:33.178 --> 38:35.849
And I would really appreciate
your support on this.

38:38.524 --> 38:40.150
Okay, fine.

38:40.185 --> 38:42.493
Better give me your landline
because you and phones--

38:42.528 --> 38:43.989
I already texted it to you.

38:44.024 --> 38:47.355
Oh, you do know how
to use a cell phone.

38:47.390 --> 38:50.897
Look at you, going
into the 21st century.

38:50.932 --> 38:53.064
I'm proud of you.
You're fuckin' insane.

38:53.099 --> 38:54.868
-Really sweet, thank you.
-Yeah, I know.

38:54.903 --> 38:56.672
I love you too, bitch.

39:58.428 --> 40:00.604
Ms. Ambrose, my name is Elly.

40:00.639 --> 40:03.233
Now, I understand
you like your privacy

40:03.268 --> 40:05.939
and I respect that,
but if you need anything,

40:05.974 --> 40:07.941
day or night,
don't hesitate to call me.

40:07.976 --> 40:09.811
I'll be here.

40:11.947 --> 40:14.244
Okay, so I'm just going

40:14.279 --> 40:16.455
to pull the covers down here.

40:21.957 --> 40:26.531
Make sure you're nice
and tight... there.

40:36.466 --> 40:38.004
Ms. Ambrose.

40:38.039 --> 40:39.808
Hello, how are you?

41:17.210 --> 41:18.517

46:26.321 --> 46:28.486
Hi, Ms. Ambrose.

46:32.393 --> 46:35.834
Just gonna check
your pulse here, okay?

46:37.827 --> 46:40.168
Blue's a good color for you.

46:40.203 --> 46:42.170
I'm sure you know that.

46:43.404 --> 46:44.799
All good.

46:44.834 --> 46:46.911
I think you look ready
for bed, huh?

46:48.673 --> 46:50.013
Me too.

46:51.577 --> 46:53.643
I'll just, uh...

46:53.678 --> 46:55.810
sit with you
for a little while.

48:12.592 --> 48:14.064
Hello. Ambrose residence.

48:14.099 --> 48:16.264
<i>Hello, Nurse Gamble.</i>

48:16.299 --> 48:17.793
Hey, what's up?

48:17.828 --> 48:19.267
<i>Just thought I'd call</i>
<i>and check in.</i>

48:19.302 --> 48:20.928
<i>Tried your cell,</i>
<i>but per usual,</i>

48:20.963 --> 48:23.073
<i>you threw it in the middle</i>
<i>of the ocean somewhere.</i>

48:23.108 --> 48:24.800
Sorry, I was sitting
with Ms. Ambrose

48:24.835 --> 48:25.900
and I had
some music playing.

48:25.935 --> 48:28.474
<i>Oh, it sounds romantic.</i>

48:28.509 --> 48:30.740
Not exactly, you weirdo.

48:30.775 --> 48:32.742
Oh, so I found
some old records,

48:32.777 --> 48:34.315
and they all had
"Dorothy Ambrose"

48:34.350 --> 48:36.317
written on them--
I guess that's the daughter?

48:36.352 --> 48:40.090
<i>You mean the one that</i>
<i>went away some time ago?</i>

48:40.125 --> 48:42.125
Do you really think
she'll come back?

48:42.160 --> 48:43.918
<i>Okay, are you having</i>
<i>a delayed freakout?</i>

48:43.953 --> 48:45.458
<i>'Cause I can</i>
<i>still come and get you.</i>

48:45.493 --> 48:46.756
No, I'm fine.

48:46.791 --> 48:48.098
Thank you for
the vote of confidence.

48:48.133 --> 48:49.924
<i>Listen, it turns out</i>
<i>that I'm off Sunday,</i>

48:49.959 --> 48:51.926
<i>so how about</i>
<i>I come down there,</i>

48:51.961 --> 48:54.434
<i>bring you some real food,</i>
<i>perhaps some real booze?</i>

48:54.469 --> 48:57.602
I mean, that does
sound tempting.

48:57.637 --> 48:58.933
Don't know what I'm gonna do

48:58.968 --> 49:00.935
with all these
microwave dinners.

49:00.970 --> 49:02.673
<i> Eleanor.</i>

49:03.973 --> 49:05.049
<i> Elly?</i>

49:08.714 --> 49:10.120
Yeah?

49:10.155 --> 49:11.990
<i>What is it?</i>

49:13.356 --> 49:14.949
Um... nothing.

49:14.984 --> 49:16.324
But I should go.

49:16.359 --> 49:18.953
<i>Okay, just...</i>
<i>look out for yourself, okay?</i>

49:18.988 --> 49:21.296
Yes, nurse.
I'll see you Sunday.

49:21.331 --> 49:22.330
<i>Night.</i>

49:22.365 --> 49:23.562
Night.

50:24.955 --> 50:27.758
Looks like someone's trying
to scare you is all.

50:27.793 --> 50:29.023
Well, they succeeded.

50:29.058 --> 50:30.200
I'll look into it,

50:30.235 --> 50:32.235
but I don't think
you need to worry, ma'am.

50:32.270 --> 50:34.237
It's probably some kids.

50:34.272 --> 50:35.733
Do kids even live around here?

50:35.768 --> 50:37.867
It just feels pretty isolated.

50:37.902 --> 50:40.243
Yeah, you're right about that,
it is isolated.

50:40.278 --> 50:42.872
But there's some farmland
that borders the property.

50:42.907 --> 50:46.117
I'll ask around and see
if anybody saw anything.

50:46.152 --> 50:47.547
Okay.

50:47.582 --> 50:49.945
The place has a bit
of a history is all.

50:51.080 --> 50:52.453
A history of...?

50:52.488 --> 50:54.554
It's superstitious stuff

50:54.589 --> 50:56.820
that people like you and me
pay no attention to.

50:58.593 --> 51:00.626
But I'll check back in
if I find anything.

51:00.661 --> 51:02.232
How long you planning
on sticking around for?

51:02.267 --> 51:04.465
Just until Monday.
An ambulance is gonna come

51:04.500 --> 51:06.060
take Ms. Ambrose
to the hospital.

51:06.095 --> 51:07.435
Dorothy took ill?

51:07.470 --> 51:10.339
No, Dorothy's away.
I'm looking after her mother.

51:12.101 --> 51:14.244
Old Ms. Ambrose?

51:14.279 --> 51:16.444
Yeah, that's right.

51:19.108 --> 51:21.284
I thought she died.

51:21.319 --> 51:22.582
Oh, no.

51:22.617 --> 51:23.649
Well, she had a stroke,

51:23.684 --> 51:26.289
but... still hanging in there.

51:32.462 --> 51:33.824
All right.

51:35.124 --> 51:36.431
Well, I better get going.

51:36.466 --> 51:38.092
Yeah.

51:38.127 --> 51:40.127
-Good night, ma'am.
-Thank you for coming.

51:40.162 --> 51:41.634
Oh, any time.
Have a good night.

51:41.669 --> 51:42.701
Good night.

52:57.547 --> 52:59.349
Hey.

52:59.384 --> 53:00.944
What's your name?

53:03.212 --> 53:04.750
My name's Elly.

53:04.785 --> 53:06.290
You live around here?

53:14.432 --> 53:16.597
<i> If you insist</i>
<i>on staying there,</i>

53:16.632 --> 53:18.764
<i>then I insist on looking into</i>
<i>that Alma lady, for real.</i>

53:18.799 --> 53:20.227
<i>She creeps me out.</i>

53:20.262 --> 53:22.196
Okay, and how do you
propose to do that?

53:22.231 --> 53:24.374
<i>My dad has this investigator,</i>
<i>I think his name's Novak.</i>

53:24.409 --> 53:26.200
<i>He uses him only</i>
<i>in criminal cases,</i>

53:26.235 --> 53:27.575
<i>but he's really,</i>
<i>really good.</i>

53:27.610 --> 53:28.609
You're serious?

53:28.644 --> 53:30.237
<i>Damn straight, I'm serious.</i>

53:30.272 --> 53:32.580
<i>Just don't go too far</i>
<i>from that old telephone</i>

53:32.615 --> 53:34.912
<i>and watch your back, girl.</i>

54:38.516 --> 54:42.012
<i> Come and gaze</i>
<i>at his blaze of fire,</i>

54:42.047 --> 54:45.620
<i>where winged embers rise</i>
<i>to kindling choir!</i>

54:45.655 --> 54:47.281
<i>He is darkness.</i>

54:47.316 --> 54:49.118
<i>He is whispers.</i>

54:49.153 --> 54:51.120
<i>He is sweet</i>
<i>inside your heart.</i>

54:51.155 --> 54:52.693
<i>He is heat, he is smoke...</i>

54:52.728 --> 54:55.795
<i>he is fire in your throat.</i>

55:15.179 --> 55:17.047
Dorothy, is that you?

55:21.383 --> 55:24.219
My name's Elly. Alma hired me
to look after your mother.

55:24.254 --> 55:26.694
I hope you don't think
I'm intruding.

55:51.281 --> 55:53.721
Ms. Ambrose,
did you say something?

56:33.125 --> 56:35.763
<i> Eleanor!</i>

56:35.798 --> 56:39.569
<i>I told you you could</i>
<i>never leave me again.</i>

56:39.604 --> 56:41.571
<i>Do you hear me, Eleanor?</i>

56:41.606 --> 56:44.233
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

56:44.268 --> 56:47.775
<i>I'll always be with you!</i>

56:47.810 --> 56:49.304
No!

56:49.339 --> 56:51.482
No! No!

56:51.517 --> 56:52.945
No!

57:25.309 --> 57:26.847
<i> So, what did</i>
<i>Novak find?</i>

57:26.882 --> 57:29.278
<i> It's what he didn't find</i>
<i>that bothers me,</i>

57:29.313 --> 57:31.489
a record of any Alma Whitelorn.

57:32.987 --> 57:35.790
Maybe she's just
a family friend helping out?

57:35.825 --> 57:37.154
Novak asked around.

57:37.189 --> 57:39.453
Nobody's ever heard
of this Alma woman.

57:39.488 --> 57:41.961
Far as he knows, it's just
Ms. Ambrose and a daughter.

57:41.996 --> 57:43.358
-Dorothy?
-Right.

57:43.393 --> 57:45.360
She's listed as
the mother's next-of-kin.

57:47.496 --> 57:49.034
Look, pumpkin.

57:49.069 --> 57:50.805
There's something else.

57:50.840 --> 57:53.676
There's rumors about
this place going way back.

57:53.711 --> 57:55.139
Now, I know most of it sounds

57:55.174 --> 57:57.009
like old campfire
ghost stories to me...

57:57.044 --> 57:59.011
-But?
-But...

57:59.046 --> 58:01.046
I've never seen
my guy so spooked.

58:01.081 --> 58:03.048
If I were you,
I'd pull Elly out of there.

58:03.083 --> 58:04.852
He thinks it's
all kinds of wrong.

58:04.887 --> 58:07.052
-Novak said that?
-Mm-hmm.

58:07.087 --> 58:08.823
Fuck.

58:08.858 --> 58:10.891
I mean shit. I mean...

58:10.926 --> 58:12.222
Sorry, Dad.

58:22.938 --> 58:25.873
Didn't mean to startle you.

58:25.908 --> 58:28.337
Just paying a quick visit.

58:28.372 --> 58:31.714
I'm Mary Lynn Crandon,
and this is my daughter Sadie.

58:31.749 --> 58:33.848
Hi. I'm Elly.

58:33.883 --> 58:37.346
Sadie's here to apologize.

58:37.381 --> 58:40.591
So you were the one who threw
the apple with the note?

58:40.626 --> 58:42.417
She meant well, but...

58:42.452 --> 58:44.892
she just went about it
all wrong.

58:44.927 --> 58:47.092
Apologize to the lady.

58:48.931 --> 58:52.394
It's okay,
there's no real harm done.

58:56.774 --> 58:59.742
Did you wanna come in
for some coffee or...

58:59.777 --> 59:01.238
No.

59:01.273 --> 59:04.714
I have to run
some errands in town.

59:04.749 --> 59:06.914
I'd be happy to drop you off
at the bus station.

59:12.449 --> 59:13.547
What is she looking at?

59:15.419 --> 59:17.155
A bad memory.

59:18.587 --> 59:21.764
You've got no business
being here.

59:21.799 --> 59:24.734
I'm a nurse, I'm here
to care for Ms. Ambrose.

59:24.769 --> 59:27.902
I know something about
Ms. Ambrose that you don't.

59:27.937 --> 59:30.102
And what's that?

59:30.137 --> 59:32.170
She's dead.

59:45.482 --> 59:47.581
Um... hi. Excuse me.

59:47.616 --> 59:49.924
I'm looking for one of those...

59:49.959 --> 59:51.321
Shoot, I don't know the name.

59:51.356 --> 59:53.257
They're like
in all the horror movies

59:53.292 --> 59:56.425
and like investigator...
shows, whatever.

59:56.460 --> 59:57.965
They're like micro-- Oh!

59:58.000 --> 59:59.769
Microfish.

59:59.804 --> 1:00:03.102
I think you mean
a "microfiche"?

1:00:03.137 --> 1:00:06.105
I have one.
I can show you if you like.

1:00:06.140 --> 1:00:08.140
I would love that.

1:00:10.980 --> 1:00:12.276
She's dead?

1:00:12.311 --> 1:00:13.816
That's not possible.

1:00:15.721 --> 1:00:16.984
What's in that back bedroom

1:00:17.019 --> 1:00:18.953
is a demon in a shell,
nothing more.

1:00:18.988 --> 1:00:20.152
That's enough.

1:00:20.187 --> 1:00:21.824
I locked them up together
in hell

1:00:21.859 --> 1:00:24.156
with the crucifix
I carved in her throat.

1:00:24.191 --> 1:00:25.795
Your daughter is right here.

1:00:25.830 --> 1:00:28.160
That wicked Jezebel,
Dorothy Ambrose,

1:00:28.195 --> 1:00:29.623
wants her mother out,

1:00:29.658 --> 1:00:31.163
but the only way
it will let her go

1:00:31.198 --> 1:00:34.001
is if it has a nice
young body to slip into.

1:00:34.036 --> 1:00:35.805
That's where you come in.

1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:38.632
Get out of here,
or I'll call the cops.

1:00:38.667 --> 1:00:40.205
And I know your daughter
has my phone,

1:00:40.240 --> 1:00:42.636
I want it back now.

1:00:42.671 --> 1:00:46.816
She's no thief.
She only came here to warn you.

1:00:46.851 --> 1:00:48.642
Why doesn't she speak

1:00:48.677 --> 1:00:52.019
instead of sneaking around
leaving horrible notes?

1:00:53.682 --> 1:00:54.857
Sadie.

1:00:59.061 --> 1:01:00.357
Oh, my...

1:01:16.111 --> 1:01:19.244
The doctors said
it looked like her tongue

1:01:19.279 --> 1:01:21.675
had been chewed off
in the womb.

1:01:21.710 --> 1:01:24.678
I know that whatever did
the chewing is still in there.

1:01:24.713 --> 1:01:26.449
Dormant.

1:01:27.716 --> 1:01:29.859
I see it sometimes.

1:01:29.894 --> 1:01:32.257
The way she looks
right straight through me

1:01:32.292 --> 1:01:34.688
or when she's staring
off into space.

1:01:34.723 --> 1:01:37.592
But don't think I won't be
ready for the day it wakes up.

1:01:40.905 --> 1:01:42.267
Thomas...

1:01:42.302 --> 1:01:43.807
my husband?

1:01:45.569 --> 1:01:50.539
He gave into temptation,
just once.

1:01:50.574 --> 1:01:53.542
But when he tried
to break it off with Dorothy,

1:01:53.577 --> 1:01:56.545
she became fixated on him.

1:01:56.580 --> 1:02:00.219
When he rejected her,
she had a breakdown.

1:02:00.254 --> 1:02:02.551
She told her mother
that he'd been spreading

1:02:02.586 --> 1:02:04.289
filthy lies about her,

1:02:04.324 --> 1:02:07.424
and then she went
and ran off like a coward.

1:02:11.760 --> 1:02:15.938
"Dorothy Ambrose,
pictures from..."

1:02:15.973 --> 1:02:20.569
<i> So Ms. Ambrose</i>
<i>put a hex on Thomas</i>

1:02:20.604 --> 1:02:22.945
<i>and his unborn children.</i>

1:02:22.980 --> 1:02:26.740
<i>That's how Sadie came to be</i>
<i>one of the accursed.</i>

1:02:26.775 --> 1:02:32.086
What did you get
yourself into, Elly?

1:02:32.121 --> 1:02:36.288
I'm sorry, do you really expect
me to believe in curses?

1:02:36.323 --> 1:02:38.752
We were skeptics too.

1:02:38.787 --> 1:02:41.128
Until our second.

1:02:41.163 --> 1:02:43.031
Lily.

1:02:46.531 --> 1:02:48.971
She wasn't as strong as Sadie.

1:02:50.535 --> 1:02:53.338
Died a week after she was born.

1:02:56.475 --> 1:02:58.816
Thomas blamed himself.

1:03:02.184 --> 1:03:04.822
So one night
he came out here...

1:03:06.815 --> 1:03:08.991
and he hung himself

1:03:09.026 --> 1:03:10.685
from this tree.

1:03:12.326 --> 1:03:14.997
Sadie found him
the next morning.

1:03:16.528 --> 1:03:17.967
Froze pretty bad.

1:03:18.002 --> 1:03:19.628
Oh, my God.

1:03:19.663 --> 1:03:23.874
"He who is hanged
is accursed of God."

1:03:23.909 --> 1:03:27.009
Deuteronomy- 23.

1:03:28.408 --> 1:03:30.507
I'm so sorry, Mary Lynn.

1:03:32.577 --> 1:03:34.984
Well, I took my revenge.

1:03:35.019 --> 1:03:38.152
Although we're not done yet,
Sadie and me.

1:03:38.187 --> 1:03:41.716
Maybe you should stop now,
just call it even.

1:03:41.751 --> 1:03:43.025
Even?

1:03:43.060 --> 1:03:44.521
What if something
happens to Sadie?

1:03:44.556 --> 1:03:45.995
What if you get
yourself arrested?

1:03:46.030 --> 1:03:47.557
What kind of example
are you setting?

1:03:50.397 --> 1:03:52.936
You don't have
a daughter, do you?

1:03:54.434 --> 1:03:56.830
-No.
-Well, if you did,

1:03:56.865 --> 1:03:59.833
you'd know there's no stopping
them turning into you,

1:03:59.868 --> 1:04:02.209
sure as night follows day.

1:04:05.951 --> 1:04:08.215
She covered her neck,
didn't she?

1:04:08.250 --> 1:04:11.251
What?

1:04:11.286 --> 1:04:14.353
Look, you can bury your head
in the sand if you want,

1:04:14.388 --> 1:04:16.223
but mark my words,

1:04:16.258 --> 1:04:19.787
we will burn down this cabin.

1:04:35.805 --> 1:04:37.277
I thought you were
off tonight.

1:04:37.312 --> 1:04:38.773
-I am.
-Okay, so what did I tell you

1:04:38.808 --> 1:04:40.214
about getting yourself a life?

1:04:40.249 --> 1:04:41.446
Yeah, still working on that.

1:04:41.481 --> 1:04:43.118
Listen, if a patient
is checking into

1:04:43.153 --> 1:04:45.252
a private room on Monday, would
that be in the system yet?

1:04:45.287 --> 1:04:48.057
You trying to shack up
with the patients again, Beth?

1:04:48.092 --> 1:04:49.586
Uh, fuck you.

1:04:49.621 --> 1:04:51.885
No, I am checking
on a friend's mother.

1:04:51.920 --> 1:04:53.227
So could you do me
a huge favor

1:04:53.262 --> 1:04:55.625
and please just run
her name through the system?

1:04:55.660 --> 1:04:58.727
I mean, I could,
but you owe me a margarita.

1:04:58.762 --> 1:05:00.894
-Yeah, fine, whatever.
-Okay.

1:05:00.929 --> 1:05:05.272
A-M-B-R-O-S-E.

1:05:05.307 --> 1:05:07.934
Ambrose.

1:05:07.969 --> 1:05:10.948
Yeah, there's nothing here
for the next 30 days.

1:05:36.503 --> 1:05:38.668
<i>Eleanor.</i>

1:06:02.199 --> 1:06:05.167
<i>You are my baby girl.</i>

1:06:05.202 --> 1:06:07.301
<i>And I'll always love you.</i>

1:06:07.336 --> 1:06:11.503
<i>You'll be my best friend</i>
<i>'til the end.</i>

1:06:11.538 --> 1:06:13.505
<i>I'll never leave you.</i>

1:06:15.212 --> 1:06:20.017
<i>When the night is cold,</i>
<i>I'll be there to warm you.</i>

1:06:21.548 --> 1:06:25.011
<i>Every dream you had before,</i>

1:06:25.046 --> 1:06:28.025
<i>we'll make them</i>
<i>all come true.</i>

1:06:29.688 --> 1:06:32.821
<i>'Cause you're my baby girl,</i>

1:06:32.856 --> 1:06:35.692
<i>and I'll always love you.</i>

1:06:35.727 --> 1:06:40.367
<i>You'll be my best friend</i>
<i>'til the end.</i>

1:06:40.402 --> 1:06:42.996
<i>I'll never leave you.</i>

1:07:12.632 --> 1:07:14.599
Ms. Ambrose, can you hear me?

1:07:46.963 --> 1:07:49.403
Oh, no.

1:07:49.438 --> 1:07:53.407
<i> Sorry, this number</i>
<i>is not currently in service.</i>

1:07:53.442 --> 1:07:54.606
Shit.

1:08:10.492 --> 1:08:11.656
Shit.

1:08:23.340 --> 1:08:25.274
Come on, Elly.

1:08:28.873 --> 1:08:30.774
<i>Please leave your message--</i>

1:08:30.809 --> 1:08:31.973
Come on, goddamn it!

1:09:12.015 --> 1:09:14.983
-Come on, come on, come on.

1:09:15.018 --> 1:09:17.051
Answer the phone, damn it!

1:09:17.086 --> 1:09:20.659
-<i> Sorry, this number--</i>
-Fuck!

1:09:20.694 --> 1:09:22.364
You should just breathe.

1:11:36.500 --> 1:11:37.862
Dad?

1:11:58.181 --> 1:12:01.248
<i>It'll all be over soon,</i>
<i>Eleanor, just one more.</i>

1:12:08.356 --> 1:12:10.158
Oh!

1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:25.943
Alma, is that you?

1:12:29.751 --> 1:12:32.686
-Please.

1:12:35.383 --> 1:12:38.890
Thank you,
little-fat-baby-jesus!

1:12:57.977 --> 1:12:59.647
Ms. Ambrose!

1:13:14.598 --> 1:13:16.158
Ms. Ambrose.

1:13:47.455 --> 1:13:49.092
<i>Eleanor!</i>

1:13:54.803 --> 1:13:58.266
<i>After Daddy abandoned us,</i>
<i>at least we had each other.</i>

1:13:58.301 --> 1:14:00.433
<i>But when you left too,</i>
<i>I was scared.</i>

1:14:00.468 --> 1:14:02.611
<i>I couldn't survive</i>
<i>without you.</i>

1:14:02.646 --> 1:14:04.437
<i>I had to bring you back.</i>

1:14:04.472 --> 1:14:07.176
<i>You'll be my best friend</i>
<i>'til the end.</i>

1:14:07.211 --> 1:14:08.815
<i>I'll never leave you.</i>

1:14:34.876 --> 1:14:36.843
Hello?

1:14:36.878 --> 1:14:38.647
El?

1:14:38.682 --> 1:14:40.473
I brought your favorite.

1:14:43.082 --> 1:14:44.411
Eww!

1:14:55.523 --> 1:14:58.227
Elly, it's me.

1:14:58.262 --> 1:15:00.031
Oh, my God.

1:15:00.066 --> 1:15:02.396
How long have you been
in here?

1:15:02.431 --> 1:15:06.334
I brought wine
to celebrate because

1:15:06.369 --> 1:15:09.876
I was on my way to save you
from that crazy house

1:15:09.911 --> 1:15:11.548
when I got your text.

1:15:13.750 --> 1:15:17.543
I have so much tea to spill
on that crazy little bitch,

1:15:17.578 --> 1:15:19.512
I don't even know where
to start.

1:15:21.923 --> 1:15:24.088
Elly?

1:15:28.589 --> 1:15:30.567
Elly, come on,
you're freaking me out.

1:16:16.780 --> 1:16:18.648
You want to go downstairs?

1:16:47.635 --> 1:16:50.174
I know... I know...

1:16:50.209 --> 1:16:52.440
Speak if you have
something to say!

1:16:52.475 --> 1:16:55.179
I know your secret,
you two-faced cunt!

1:16:57.183 --> 1:16:59.953
<i> You left me!</i>

1:17:03.860 --> 1:17:06.619
<i>I'll never leave you...</i>

1:17:06.654 --> 1:17:08.621
<i> Where did you go?!</i>

1:17:11.659 --> 1:17:14.132
<i>You're my baby girl!</i>

1:17:17.665 --> 1:17:20.204
<i>You left me all alone!</i>

1:17:20.239 --> 1:17:22.206
-Shh!

1:17:36.860 --> 1:17:38.387
-Open up, please.

1:17:38.422 --> 1:17:40.697
-It's Officer Green.
-Come in.

1:17:42.261 --> 1:17:43.997
Look, it's not safe here.

1:17:44.032 --> 1:17:45.559
Oh, you got that right.

1:17:45.594 --> 1:17:48.034
Now, we got a tip that a woman
named Mary Lynn Crandon

1:17:48.069 --> 1:17:49.695
is gonna burn this place
down tonight,

1:17:49.730 --> 1:17:52.236
so I came here to warn you
and escort you into town.

1:17:52.271 --> 1:17:53.501
Okay, great, let's go.

1:17:53.536 --> 1:17:55.008
What about Ms. Ambrose?

1:17:55.043 --> 1:17:56.713
Um...

1:17:58.244 --> 1:17:59.540
she's dead.

1:17:59.575 --> 1:18:01.047
-I thought you said--
-I know.

1:18:01.082 --> 1:18:02.851
I know, I was misinformed.

1:18:02.886 --> 1:18:04.677
She still back there?

1:18:04.712 --> 1:18:07.515
Look, I don't know
what the hell that thing is

1:18:07.550 --> 1:18:10.386
in the bedroom but I
was lured here for something.

1:18:10.421 --> 1:18:13.026
-Lured?

1:18:13.061 --> 1:18:15.688
I thought you said
she was dead.

1:18:15.723 --> 1:18:17.690
We need to leave now.

1:18:17.725 --> 1:18:19.527
I'm not leaving
some old sick woman

1:18:19.562 --> 1:18:21.430
to be burnt up in her bed
by some nut.

1:18:21.465 --> 1:18:24.532
-Look, you can't go back there.

1:18:24.567 --> 1:18:27.744
You can wait out front
with my partner if you like.

1:18:30.573 --> 1:18:31.704
Fuck!

1:18:31.739 --> 1:18:34.883
Officer Green,
don't go in there!

1:18:34.918 --> 1:18:36.918
Just wait outside.

1:18:40.825 --> 1:18:42.715
Ms. Ambrose?

1:18:42.750 --> 1:18:45.091
Ma'am, are you in here?

1:18:47.128 --> 1:18:48.930
-Oh!

1:19:11.779 --> 1:19:14.252
-Open up!
-Back away from the door!

1:19:14.287 --> 1:19:15.583
Get out of there now!

1:19:15.618 --> 1:19:17.750
Step away
from the door!

1:19:17.785 --> 1:19:20.324
She's not human,
you have to get out!

1:19:20.359 --> 1:19:21.754
Officer Green, please!

1:19:21.789 --> 1:19:24.130
Please listen to me,
I was set up!

1:19:24.165 --> 1:19:26.968
You have got to get out!
Please! Please!

1:19:27.003 --> 1:19:29.597
Just listen to me,
you have to listen to me.

1:19:29.632 --> 1:19:31.269
You have to get out now!

1:19:33.537 --> 1:19:38.342
Officer Green, open the door
right now!

1:19:38.377 --> 1:19:39.607
Please!

1:19:41.182 --> 1:19:42.775
Please!

1:19:42.810 --> 1:19:44.777
What the fuck?

1:19:55.691 --> 1:19:57.196
Officer Green?

1:20:19.682 --> 1:20:21.517
Help!

1:20:23.422 --> 1:20:25.818
-Officer!
-What happened to you?

1:20:25.853 --> 1:20:27.523
Uh-- It's a long story.

1:20:27.558 --> 1:20:29.657
Wait, where is my partner?

1:20:29.692 --> 1:20:30.658
She killed him.

1:20:30.693 --> 1:20:32.231
-Who?
-Ms. Ambrose.

1:20:32.266 --> 1:20:34.365
I need to find out
what the hell's going on here.

1:20:34.400 --> 1:20:35.597
Get in that house--

1:20:44.773 --> 1:20:46.883
Beth?

1:20:49.877 --> 1:20:52.845
Oh, Beth. Oh, my God.

1:20:52.880 --> 1:20:54.220
It's gonna be okay.

1:21:08.632 --> 1:21:10.973
I'm so tired.

1:21:31.919 --> 1:21:33.996
Alma? What did you do?

1:21:53.281 --> 1:21:54.907
Alma, please...

1:21:54.942 --> 1:21:56.414
<i>Now, hush.</i>

1:21:56.449 --> 1:21:58.449
<i>This won't hurt a bit, Eleanor.</i>

1:22:01.487 --> 1:22:03.784
<i>Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

1:22:06.459 --> 1:22:08.294
There, there.

1:22:08.329 --> 1:22:10.428
All done.

1:22:10.463 --> 1:22:11.924
Where is she?

1:22:11.959 --> 1:22:14.135
Shh!

1:22:14.170 --> 1:22:17.105
Your mother brought you here
a long time ago.

1:22:17.140 --> 1:22:19.833
You were just a girl.

1:22:19.868 --> 1:22:22.440
I gave you an apple.

1:22:22.475 --> 1:22:25.509
She wanted to put a curse
on your deadbeat daddy,

1:22:25.544 --> 1:22:27.775
but she didn't have
any money to pay with,

1:22:27.810 --> 1:22:29.117
so she paid in blood.

1:22:29.152 --> 1:22:30.943
Your blood, Elly.

1:22:30.978 --> 1:22:32.945
-A curse for a curse.

1:22:32.980 --> 1:22:34.617
My mother stored it
in the cellar

1:22:34.652 --> 1:22:36.124
in case she'd ever need it,

1:22:36.159 --> 1:22:37.785
but you destroyed it tonight,

1:22:37.820 --> 1:22:39.721
and now I'm
calling in the debt.

1:22:42.726 --> 1:22:45.859
You're out
of your fucking mind.

1:22:47.500 --> 1:22:49.962
Your mother always knew
this day would come.

1:22:49.997 --> 1:22:52.536
That's why she came back.

1:22:52.571 --> 1:22:55.968
That's why she hanged herself,

1:22:56.003 --> 1:22:57.145
to offer you up.

1:22:57.180 --> 1:22:59.004
It's your fate, Elly.

1:22:59.039 --> 1:23:03.250
Then why did you have to kill
Beth, you psycho bitch?

1:23:13.856 --> 1:23:15.394
It's a catchy song.

1:23:15.429 --> 1:23:17.495
I can see why
you hum it all the time.

1:23:18.861 --> 1:23:21.532
Wait, wait, wait! Wait.

1:23:21.567 --> 1:23:24.997
Dorothy... I know you're
Ms. Ambrose's daughter.

1:23:25.032 --> 1:23:27.208
You don't
have to pretend anymore.

1:23:27.243 --> 1:23:29.375
I get what it's like
to look after a sick parent.

1:23:29.410 --> 1:23:31.003
You were right, it's not easy.

1:23:31.038 --> 1:23:33.676
Believe me, I know.

1:23:33.711 --> 1:23:36.844
Listen, Mary Lynn
told me everything.

1:23:36.879 --> 1:23:40.188
I don't blame you
for running away.

1:23:40.223 --> 1:23:41.684
Fuck.

1:23:41.719 --> 1:23:43.752
I lied to you about
why I was volunteering.

1:23:43.787 --> 1:23:46.018
I couldn't handle
looking after my mother.

1:23:46.053 --> 1:23:48.361
I was scared of her, I was
scared of turning into her,

1:23:48.396 --> 1:23:51.232
so I ran way,
just like my dad.

1:23:53.269 --> 1:23:54.730
I left her

1:23:54.765 --> 1:23:58.371
when she needed me most.

1:23:58.406 --> 1:24:00.406
And she killed herself.

1:24:02.245 --> 1:24:04.410
I know your pain, Dorothy.

1:24:07.580 --> 1:24:10.548
My name is Alma.

1:24:27.963 --> 1:24:31.140
There's your friend.

1:24:31.175 --> 1:24:32.438
In your face!

1:24:32.473 --> 1:24:34.902
Always had an answer
for everything!

1:24:34.937 --> 1:24:36.805
Well, I fooled her, didn't I?

1:24:38.479 --> 1:24:40.644
Now, swallow her down!

1:24:51.151 --> 1:24:53.822
This is a ritual
my mother taught me.

1:24:58.697 --> 1:25:00.433
Are you ready...

1:25:00.468 --> 1:25:02.699
to gaze into hell?

1:25:18.486 --> 1:25:21.289
"Come and gaze
at his blaze of fire,

1:25:21.324 --> 1:25:25.293
where winged embers rise
to kindling choir!"

1:25:25.328 --> 1:25:27.955
"He is darkness,
he is whispers,

1:25:27.990 --> 1:25:30.463
he is sweet inside
your heart."

1:25:30.498 --> 1:25:33.301
"He is heat, he is smoke,

1:25:33.336 --> 1:25:35.798
he is fire in your throat."

1:25:35.833 --> 1:25:38.163
Ms. Ambrose?

1:25:38.198 --> 1:25:40.704
"I invite you
to rise out of your shell."

1:25:40.739 --> 1:25:45.346
"I implore you
to visit us from hell."

1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:50.879
He is coming
for his fresh vessel!

1:25:57.261 --> 1:25:59.723
Yes!

1:26:02.189 --> 1:26:03.199
No...

1:26:05.060 --> 1:26:06.565
What's happening?

1:26:08.767 --> 1:26:10.833
No...

1:26:10.868 --> 1:26:13.902
-What's happening to her?

1:26:33.396 --> 1:26:34.527
Take her!

1:26:37.631 --> 1:26:38.762
You!

1:26:41.228 --> 1:26:42.601
Curse you!

1:26:45.408 --> 1:26:47.573
You tried that already.

1:27:20.300 --> 1:27:23.235
"Demon, O Demon,
take back now to part

1:27:23.270 --> 1:27:25.809
well of flame
that floods the heart."

1:27:25.844 --> 1:27:28.977
"Demon, O Demon,
return to thine host,

1:27:29.012 --> 1:27:32.145
rejoin thine legion,
abandon this host!"
