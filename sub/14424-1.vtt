Mom, we beat 'em 5 to 1, here's dad.

01:58.292 --> 02:02.876
We'll be home after 6:00, bye.

02:07.209 --> 02:09.751
Fucking old whore.

Legia's a fucking old whore, fuck Legia!

- Got a boyfriend?
- No.

- Expecting someone?
- No.

04:25.167 --> 04:26.209
Do you know them?

04:27.751 --> 04:29.584
No, fuck them.

04:50.251 --> 04:52.584
The guards are fucking you over.

04:53.001 --> 04:56.042
It's break-in and theft.

05:13.667 --> 05:14.667
Fuck!

05:16.501 --> 05:17.334
What the...?

05:18.584 --> 05:19.876
Oh fuck...

05:23.292 --> 05:24.834
You broke my fucking window?

05:27.417 --> 05:29.126
You'll replace it, asshole.

05:30.001 --> 05:31.209
I'm calling the cops.

05:32.001 --> 05:32.917
Shut the fuck up.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.167
You're not calling anywhere.

05:38.001 --> 05:41.459
And tomorrow you get her a new window,
bring me 1000

05:41.876 --> 05:42.792
...and flowers.

05:43.709 --> 05:45.376
If not, I'll fucking find you.

06:04.876 --> 06:06.584
You scared the fuck out of me.

06:07.084 --> 06:11.126
As long as your prints aren't on the dope
you can say a passenger left it.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.626
- What do you want?
- 2 grams of hash.

06:17.209 --> 06:18.667
- Fuckin' gangsta.
- What?

06:19.001 --> 06:21.709
Speed dealer they showed us this morning.

06:25.542 --> 06:26.292
Gangsta.

06:28.376 --> 06:29.376
Hey, numnuts.

06:33.626 --> 06:34.876
Stop, police!

07:02.251 --> 07:09.542
Central Police Headquarters
Psychology Unit

07:10.917 --> 07:13.084
He yelled,
"I'll kill you, prick!" and stabbed me.

07:13.751 --> 07:14.584
What did you feel?

07:17.876 --> 07:19.792
The first time on the
job someone called me

07:19.792 --> 07:21.584
a prick I got a bit
offended, but now...

07:21.959 --> 07:24.667
I got home, looked in the
mirror, saw I don't look

07:24.667 --> 07:27.126
like a prick, so I don't
get offended anymore.

07:29.167 --> 07:31.042
If they'd found drugs in
your blood, you'd do time.

07:31.501 --> 07:32.209
They didn't.

07:32.709 --> 07:34.334
They check only for alcohol.

07:38.542 --> 07:41.376
For two years you were
undercover in a drug ring.

07:42.167 --> 07:44.001
Trying to tell me that
didn't break you?

07:48.834 --> 07:51.042
I've asked to the chief to
transfer you out of narcotics.

07:52.626 --> 07:53.251
To where?

07:53.834 --> 07:55.167
To life and health. Mokotow.

07:56.251 --> 07:59.126
District Police Headquarters II
Mokotow District

08:01.292 --> 08:03.709
You must catch only
petty criminals.

08:05.334 --> 08:06.042
And the big ones?

08:06.542 --> 08:08.334
Holy smoke, you can't catch them.

08:09.584 --> 08:10.959
Why not, chief?

08:12.001 --> 08:14.626
What are we going to do
if you wipe out crime?

08:15.334 --> 08:17.334
Minnows count as much as big fish,
and are easier to find.

08:17.834 --> 08:19.376
Stats don't differentiate.

08:21.126 --> 08:23.167
Like in a western. A
stagecoach circled

08:23.167 --> 08:25.376
by Indians beating the
shit out of a guy.

08:25.751 --> 08:28.834
Looks like they're using gas guns.

08:33.042 --> 08:36.126
- Police! Stop or I'll shoot.
- Fuck you, go ahead and shoot.

08:37.751 --> 08:38.251
Dud?

08:41.583 --> 08:42.167
Get down!

08:45.251 --> 08:45.834
What's going on?

08:48.042 --> 08:48.626
Gentlemen...

08:49.709 --> 08:50.917
I have grievances with only

08:51.417 --> 08:52.667
him, him, and him,

08:53.042 --> 08:54.834
who were beating me,
but not the others.

08:55.292 --> 08:56.292
What's this all about?

08:57.376 --> 08:59.209
Are you gentlemen?

08:59.709 --> 09:01.167
Ever seen a gentleman cop?

09:01.542 --> 09:04.542
If you piss me off, I'll let
them finish the job. Talk!

09:06.417 --> 09:09.001
I was once deputy chief
of the municipal guard.

09:09.501 --> 09:12.251
Someone sent my boss
intimate photos of me.

09:13.209 --> 09:16.709
I wasn't with a woman, but a man,
giving each other a blow job.

09:17.501 --> 09:19.959
That was not tolerated, so
I was ordered to resign.

09:20.501 --> 09:25.167
I did have a pro-male orientation
once, but now I fuck only women.

09:26.959 --> 09:28.792
The gents who were beating me
are from my male period.

09:29.542 --> 09:31.959
I said once that one
of them sucked my dick.

09:32.167 --> 09:35.751
He got angry, went to the others,
and said I was lying.

09:35.959 --> 09:37.292
They came to me and told me
to take it back.

09:38.001 --> 09:38.584
I looked at them.

09:39.209 --> 09:40.917
Those yelling the loudest were:

09:42.292 --> 09:44.209
he gave me a blowjob 30 times,

09:45.209 --> 09:47.501
and him I fucked in the ass 15 times.

09:47.959 --> 09:50.667
Basically, I've had fun with all of them.

09:51.251 --> 09:52.334
That's what we do.

09:53.001 --> 09:53.501
So I said to him,

09:54.042 --> 09:56.876
"You sucked my dick, I fucked you
in the ass. Where's the lie?

09:57.209 --> 09:58.167
They pulled out their pistols,

09:58.417 --> 10:00.667
I pulled out mine, and
we began shooting.

10:01.042 --> 10:03.167
I fucked you in the ass,
you gave me a blowjob.

10:05.042 --> 10:06.126
Which one did you fuck
in the ass?

10:07.459 --> 10:09.626
Him, him, him, and him.

10:10.542 --> 10:11.709
Which one sucked your dick?

10:13.042 --> 10:15.167
Him, him, and him.

10:15.834 --> 10:17.126
00 to 39.

10:17.459 --> 10:19.584
We picked up the thieves.

10:19.709 --> 10:22.709
Go see the woman
who bought the hot stereo from them.

10:25.917 --> 10:29.751
Not only did the pricks fuck up
the remodeling... Hang on.

10:35.084 --> 10:35.917
Hello?

10:36.209 --> 10:37.501
Police, please let us in.

10:37.834 --> 10:40.209
Don't bullshit me, or
I'll call the real police.

10:42.167 --> 10:44.376
Nothing, fuckin' kids
pretending to be cops

10:44.376 --> 10:46.751
so they can smoke in the
stairwell... Hang on.

10:48.959 --> 10:50.167
What now?

10:50.501 --> 10:52.334
Please open the door, or
we'll smash it open.

10:57.667 --> 11:01.417
Oh fuck, Anka, I think it
really is the cops. Hang on.

11:10.667 --> 11:13.042
I could glue in a shitty
picture like that myself.

11:13.584 --> 11:14.459
Did you buy a stereo?

11:14.876 --> 11:17.626
So, cops go round now
doing marketing surveys?

11:18.042 --> 11:19.084
The stereo is stolen property.

11:20.001 --> 11:20.792
What?!

11:24.001 --> 11:24.709
Hello.

11:26.917 --> 11:29.584
Did your partner call you 'cause
he's afraid to be alone with me?

11:31.084 --> 11:31.626
Yeah.

11:32.459 --> 11:35.751
God, what handsome men are
on the force these days.

11:37.876 --> 11:39.126
How about some wine?

11:39.709 --> 11:40.417
On duty?

11:49.501 --> 11:51.042
You can always go off duty.

11:56.792 --> 11:58.209
Write straight.

12:23.417 --> 12:24.042
Hello.

12:25.209 --> 12:28.042
Two guys dressed as police
officers just stole my stereo.

12:33.751 --> 12:38.667
Anka, the cops took my stereo.
The one I bought from the workers.

12:39.001 --> 12:41.542
There's going to be a shootout, fuck me.

12:42.084 --> 12:43.167
Stop, police.

12:44.876 --> 12:46.459
I'm a cop, too.

12:50.001 --> 12:53.584
040, 221 on the scene.
They're ours.

12:56.667 --> 13:00.376
One of them was so tasty.

13:00.834 --> 13:01.959
Really hot.

13:07.751 --> 13:08.501
Turn on the siren.

13:27.501 --> 13:30.376
Officer Dariusz Wolkowski,
ID and vehicle registration.

13:31.584 --> 13:32.167
I don't have them.

13:32.792 --> 13:35.792
We'll go to the station and
the car will be towed away.

13:39.792 --> 13:43.709
I'll tell you what we'll do, kid.
I have a meeting at 8:00 o'clock.

13:44.917 --> 13:46.084
Call this guy.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.417
At this number.

13:48.084 --> 13:49.834
Tell him Tomek said to call.

13:50.459 --> 13:51.251
Granny.

13:51.876 --> 13:53.626
You need the registration ASAP.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.001
He brings the papers,

13:55.834 --> 13:57.459
and I give you a big tip, deal?

14:17.542 --> 14:19.126
What's the tip?

14:23.834 --> 14:26.709
Soon things'll be put
in order in Mokotow.

14:27.209 --> 14:28.584
There'll be a murder,

14:29.626 --> 14:31.501
and I'm going to be involved.

14:32.834 --> 14:35.876
I'm telling you this only
because you'll never prove it.

14:44.167 --> 14:47.834
What the fuck good is that tip
if I can't prove you did it?

14:59.876 --> 15:00.876
Olek!

15:27.376 --> 15:28.667
Sit up.

15:31.542 --> 15:33.376
Sit up.

15:35.626 --> 15:37.084
Sit up, goddamit!

15:37.417 --> 15:39.001
Olek, stop fooling around.

15:49.876 --> 15:50.959
Want some help?

15:55.126 --> 15:56.709
I'll be home late.
Got a meeting of the board.

16:25.584 --> 16:26.959
Hi, dad.

16:39.126 --> 16:42.501
Marcin how much test are
you doing now?

16:44.626 --> 16:46.834
Dude, I've never taken steroids.

16:51.501 --> 16:53.001
I give you the shots.

16:55.792 --> 16:57.209
Oh yeah.

16:59.126 --> 17:01.542
Thirteen gangsters,
practically the whole group.

17:18.334 --> 17:20.126
Who's the boss here?

17:21.209 --> 17:23.626
Who the fuck is asking?

17:36.584 --> 17:37.792
Who's second in command?

17:43.709 --> 17:46.292
Mokotow is mine. You can work
for me or get the fuck out.

17:52.834 --> 17:53.709
What's wrong with him?

17:54.417 --> 17:57.626
He faints at the sight of blood.
We use him because he's big.

18:00.251 --> 18:01.501
Is that why he's called "Fear?"

18:02.292 --> 18:04.751
No, he was fucked up once
and walked like this.

18:06.084 --> 18:08.459
Good, I don't have pussies
on my team.

18:08.917 --> 18:11.751
Everyone must be trained so
he never turns state's evidence.

18:12.251 --> 18:13.001
What do we do now?

18:14.584 --> 18:15.501
Call the cops.

18:30.376 --> 18:31.917
What were you doing when
the shooting started?

18:33.334 --> 18:34.251
Working my quads.

18:34.501 --> 18:35.584
What'd you see?

18:36.459 --> 18:37.917
A football game.

18:38.417 --> 18:39.376
Who were the teams?

18:44.834 --> 18:46.876
How many guys on a team?

18:49.876 --> 18:51.042
Eleven

18:52.417 --> 18:53.626
With the goalie or without?

18:59.126 --> 18:59.834
Without.

19:05.001 --> 19:07.251
Know what, Marcin Opalka?

19:09.751 --> 19:11.334
Get the fuck on home.

19:11.584 --> 19:12.834
Can I finish my training?

19:13.251 --> 19:14.584
Are you the boss of
the anti-terror unit?

19:17.251 --> 19:19.501
Mostowski Palace
Central Police Headquarters

19:19.626 --> 19:22.334
I'm new here in Mokotow.

19:23.667 --> 19:25.751
I know Tomasz Barbasiewicz,
alias "Granny",

19:25.792 --> 19:28.167
could've killed the dude in the gym.

19:28.209 --> 19:30.751
Protection racket gangsters
train there.

19:31.376 --> 19:33.084
I think Granny's taken over
their turf.

19:33.334 --> 19:34.876
I've got only green tea.

19:38.292 --> 19:39.334
I'll put it this way.

19:39.751 --> 19:42.042
I suspect you know a lot
more about this group, and

19:42.042 --> 19:44.292
extortion of shopkeepers
isn't your level, so...

19:44.792 --> 19:47.751
If you could help by telling me
who else to pressure, then...

19:48.376 --> 19:49.584
I've got a proposal.

19:51.542 --> 19:53.834
I'll find out which gym
they move to and I'll

19:53.834 --> 19:56.334
give you their phones and
car keys for an hour.

19:57.709 --> 19:58.542
How'll you do that?

19:59.292 --> 20:00.792
I'll steal them from
their lockers.

20:01.376 --> 20:02.959
I'll have a magic button
to pressure them with.

20:03.792 --> 20:05.667
You'll have phone numbers
and emails.

20:06.251 --> 20:10.959
You'll have the keys so you can
search them, install GPS tracking.

20:11.417 --> 20:12.709
Install a wiretap, whatever.

20:13.251 --> 20:14.001
Sugar?

20:15.251 --> 20:15.834
No.

20:17.126 --> 20:19.792
- Does your boss know you're here?
- Yeah.

20:20.584 --> 20:25.001
I have to write up a report that I talked
to you. You know that, don't you?

20:25.417 --> 20:29.084
Go ahead, I've got nothing
to hide. Can't I be here?

20:29.584 --> 20:32.209
Yeah, but it's not
like in your unit; we

20:32.209 --> 20:34.834
have to make sure
there are no leaks.

20:36.126 --> 20:39.667
Listen, your proposition...

20:41.417 --> 20:43.001
is very interesting,

20:44.042 --> 20:45.376
but it doesn't interest us.

20:47.334 --> 20:49.459
But I've got one for you.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.167
I mean I'll reveal

20:54.542 --> 20:56.084
a certain secret.

20:57.084 --> 20:57.792
Come here.

21:03.417 --> 21:06.126
Two guys help run the gang.

21:06.584 --> 21:07.834
Alias "Fear."

21:08.459 --> 21:11.626
Has a legal driving license
as Marcin Opalka.

21:12.417 --> 21:14.251
And alias "Soup."

21:14.626 --> 21:17.334
Has a legal driving license
as Oskar Nieklanski.

21:17.626 --> 21:18.459
Write those down.

21:19.834 --> 21:21.917
But only we know about it.

21:22.751 --> 21:23.792
And you.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.126
So, if it gets out,

21:27.917 --> 21:29.667
I'll know who sold us out.

21:30.751 --> 21:32.376
I've told you this, kid,

21:33.542 --> 21:36.084
because I feel I can
really trust you.

21:38.042 --> 21:39.501
Here's my proposal

21:40.751 --> 21:48.584
If you catch these bandits,
I have a magic telephone here.

22:00.417 --> 22:02.667
Opalka Marcin, father's name
Zdzislawa, write it in.

22:05.417 --> 22:06.626
Alias " Fear?"

22:10.376 --> 22:11.959
Type in Nieklonski Oskar.

22:14.542 --> 22:15.417
Alias "Soup?"

22:17.084 --> 22:19.542
- Who has access to this?
- Even the beat cops.

22:20.709 --> 22:22.376
What a prick.

22:23.167 --> 22:26.876
So, all of Poland knows a secret
shared only by me and Green Tea?

22:27.292 --> 22:27.751
And?

22:28.209 --> 22:28.834
Balls.

22:29.834 --> 22:31.834
He treated me like a punk kid.

22:34.834 --> 22:39.751
Ok, we'll catch these gangsters
and stick it up Mr. Green Tea's ass.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.376
Headquarters has the gangster's files.

22:42.917 --> 22:47.251
We won't show them in the system.
We know everything, they know zip.

22:47.501 --> 22:49.917
So, when does the gangster's
data get into the system ?

22:50.251 --> 22:51.876
When we and the SWATs are
breaking down the door.

22:55.917 --> 22:56.667
Thank you.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.209
Have some more cereal.

22:59.417 --> 23:00.459
I don't want any, Mom.

23:18.667 --> 23:20.084
Hi. Are you here every day?

23:25.626 --> 23:27.376
What the fuck are you looking at?

23:33.501 --> 23:37.417
No protection, so get the fuck out.
Show up tomorrow, and I'll kill you.

23:42.834 --> 23:43.792
Hey, gramps.

23:44.667 --> 23:45.584
How much do you make a day?

23:46.126 --> 23:47.626
40 zlotys.

23:48.334 --> 23:49.167
Here, now fuck off.

23:49.917 --> 23:50.917
Come help me kill the bitch

23:51.417 --> 23:54.751
- What bitch?
- I got shoes that are too small.

23:54.917 --> 23:56.584
I've told the bitch so
many times to give me my

23:56.584 --> 23:58.292
size, but she fucking
gave me shoes too small.

24:03.084 --> 24:04.834
Are you nuts, you fucking slut?

24:05.209 --> 24:07.209
How many fucking times
have I told you? How

24:07.209 --> 24:09.417
often do I have to fucking
explain, you slut?

24:09.584 --> 24:12.209
- What's your problem?
- Balls, that's my problem.

24:13.167 --> 24:16.834
You gave me a good one and one that's
too fucking small. Are you fucking nuts?

24:20.292 --> 24:22.001
You fucking slut. Fuck!

24:29.626 --> 24:30.334
Fuck.

24:33.334 --> 24:34.376
Life.

24:38.792 --> 24:40.584
That's everyone on the street.

24:41.084 --> 24:43.459
Everyone doing business
in Mokotow has to pay.

24:45.334 --> 24:47.042
- Give it to him.
- Why?

24:47.501 --> 24:49.501
He's got a mother to support.
My family's rich.

24:50.001 --> 24:51.917
- Why the fuck are you doing this?
- Fame.

24:53.001 --> 24:57.042
- I might just have some fish.
- Fear, here's some Cytomel T3.

24:57.667 --> 24:58.709
Where's the pro-tren?

24:59.292 --> 25:00.709
Hang on.

25:03.667 --> 25:04.584
What is it?

25:05.084 --> 25:07.542
There's a bunch of
guys in the stairwell

25:07.542 --> 25:10.501
dragging in kids and
stealing their allowance.

25:12.876 --> 25:14.167
Did you let them steal yours?

25:14.584 --> 25:17.542
Are you a fucking fag? Like being fucked?
Are you a faggot?

25:17.834 --> 25:18.709
No.

25:19.751 --> 25:21.001
Where?

25:28.167 --> 25:29.626
Doors?

25:30.251 --> 25:30.959
Stay here.

25:54.667 --> 25:56.417
Next time I'll fuck you over.

25:59.167 --> 26:00.959
Tell mom I'll be home late, ok?

26:06.209 --> 26:07.042
Police.

26:07.709 --> 26:08.834
What are you doing here?

26:09.084 --> 26:10.501
At a girlfriend's party.

26:11.126 --> 26:12.626
- And you?
- Me too.

26:13.167 --> 26:15.834
So you aren't prostitutes
and this isn't a brothel?

26:16.334 --> 26:17.167
No.

26:17.667 --> 26:19.792
- That's very good.
- Why?

26:20.001 --> 26:23.376
You see, I really can't
stand whores.

26:37.542 --> 26:39.542
Were we supposed to fuck
the whores or the clients ?

26:40.626 --> 26:41.584
Everyone.

26:57.126 --> 26:58.417
Do you like your work?

27:10.001 --> 27:12.126
Then grab something and
smash the bar.

27:16.834 --> 27:18.542
Your boss won't do anything.

27:49.917 --> 27:52.084
Clients treat you well?

27:58.126 --> 27:59.709
Would you like to kill
one of them?

28:07.209 --> 28:09.417
I'll bet it'll take you
only five minutes.

28:18.709 --> 28:19.667
What for?

28:21.917 --> 28:24.584
What happens will be
our little secret.

28:36.459 --> 28:38.501
They'll get blamed for it all.

28:44.209 --> 28:46.501
Just imagine that for the
next five minutes you

28:46.501 --> 28:48.626
can do whatever you
want to this schmuck.

30:15.459 --> 30:16.667
I'd really like to fuck you.

30:21.209 --> 30:23.626
I'm sorry, but it turned me on.

30:25.834 --> 30:28.459
Give me the belt;
we have to destroy it.

30:46.834 --> 30:49.334
Will you tell me your name?

30:50.376 --> 30:51.251
Hen.

30:54.709 --> 30:57.251
Satisfied that we visited, whores?

30:58.542 --> 31:02.251
- Satisfied that we visited?
- Yes.

31:03.292 --> 31:05.209
- I can't hear you.
- Yes.

31:06.501 --> 31:07.334
What do you say?

31:08.792 --> 31:10.334
Please come again.

31:47.209 --> 31:49.084
This is Tomek. He can help.

31:49.584 --> 31:51.834
I've heard you've got
problems with thugs.

31:53.042 --> 31:56.667
You need protection.
They can't keep doing this.

31:57.251 --> 32:02.876
Security with me costs 50,000, but
I guarantee no one will come here.

32:05.292 --> 32:07.834
Good morning, police. Does anyone
come here for protection money?

32:15.292 --> 32:17.417
- How many stands do you have?
- Eleven.

32:17.751 --> 32:20.667
- Anyone shaking you down?
- I don't know a thing. All sorts

32:20.667 --> 32:23.459
of shit happens here.
Go fucking look somewhere else.

32:28.042 --> 32:29.876
Those that pay are too scared.

32:30.209 --> 32:32.167
We have to find people that
the gang hasn't gotten to yet.

32:33.126 --> 32:35.751
I need a thousand business cards
with my name and phone number.

32:38.084 --> 32:41.792
If anyone tries to shake you down,
don't call the police, call me.

32:59.959 --> 33:01.084
Hello. Boss in?

33:01.417 --> 33:02.751
She'll be here tomorrow.

33:03.042 --> 33:08.126
I'm out of business cards. Tell her
to call me if they come for money.

33:09.959 --> 33:12.126
- Hello.
- Hello, we're here to see Darek.

33:13.292 --> 33:14.334
We've got lots of Dareks.

33:16.126 --> 33:17.709
A real hunk with shit in his head.

33:20.751 --> 33:22.209
Please wait, ladies.

33:25.459 --> 33:27.584
Miami, two bimbos to see you.

33:28.209 --> 33:29.251
Excuse us...

33:30.167 --> 33:33.126
I'm hitting on him. If he turns me down,
he's got a girl or he's queer.

33:36.334 --> 33:40.459
You took care of the stereo, so I thought
you'd do something else. What else?

33:48.376 --> 33:49.292
Lend me a pen.

33:57.459 --> 33:58.626
Nice ink.

34:00.001 --> 34:01.584
Tattoos mean a lot.

34:02.209 --> 34:03.584
I've got a mosquito.

34:04.959 --> 34:05.584
Where?

34:06.126 --> 34:07.126
On my butt.

34:13.001 --> 34:15.083
- Why a mosquito?
- I like getting bitten.

34:16.958 --> 34:17.917
Got any paper clips?

34:18.708 --> 34:20.626
Office supplies are at
fucking headquarters.

34:26.417 --> 34:29.208
796 076 303
Where're you from?

34:32.876 --> 34:34.626
I'm having a cookout.

34:34.833 --> 34:37.042
And I've got the kids
in Anka's car.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.542
Maybe you could drive yours
and give us a ride home.

34:45.667 --> 34:46.501
Sorry.

34:49.167 --> 34:49.583
Yeah?

34:49.917 --> 34:52.251
Hi. You were at my beauty parlor.

34:52.583 --> 34:54.083
You left this number. What's up?

34:54.501 --> 34:57.167
If any boys from Mokotow show
up with an offer you can't

34:57.167 --> 34:59.709
refuse, I'd like to get
together and talk about it.

34:59.917 --> 35:01.334
Aha...

35:01.834 --> 35:05.709
I'm out of town right now, but we can meet
when I get back. Where are you from?

35:06.167 --> 35:06.792
From Mokotow.

35:07.042 --> 35:09.459
- Who in Mokotow sent you?
- What do you mean, sent me?

35:09.667 --> 35:11.334
Who in Mokotow? Where in Mokotow?

35:11.626 --> 35:13.626
What the fuck do you mean where?
From the Mokotow police station.

35:15.417 --> 35:16.876
Ok, later.

35:24.001 --> 35:26.917
You just missed them.
The faggots were here.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.667
I told my husband not to pay.

35:30.376 --> 35:33.751
But he said the cops won't help.
He got in touch with the beat cop,

35:34.167 --> 35:35.876
who told him he can't work miracles.

35:36.126 --> 35:38.417
The bastards found out that
Maho runs money from other

35:38.417 --> 35:40.792
businesses through here, and
they jacked up his payment.

35:40.959 --> 35:43.542
Maho's a Turk so he called round.

35:43.667 --> 35:46.042
A friend's going to collect it all
so it's cheaper.

35:46.334 --> 35:50.167
If I talk to the cops, he and
his friends will be fucked. Can we do this?

35:50.751 --> 35:52.917
I'll pretend to go along
and pay them, then give

35:52.917 --> 35:55.001
you their numbers and
help put them in jail.

35:55.501 --> 35:59.334
One thing. If I help, you guarantee
you'll put them behind bars.

35:59.876 --> 36:03.626
- I'll do all I can.
- Not enough. I have a kid.

36:04.001 --> 36:06.334
I don't want to help you
if later on they find

36:06.334 --> 36:08.876
out, and you end up digging
up my husband and me.

36:09.126 --> 36:11.334
I don't want you to find
the person who killed me.

36:12.084 --> 36:14.834
That'll be obvious when
they find out I helped you.

36:15.459 --> 36:17.917
I want you to put them away
so we can live in peace.

36:20.001 --> 36:22.626
All right, I promise.

36:32.459 --> 36:35.459
- Hello.
- It's about that store on Bartycka.

36:35.459 --> 36:37.709
I've noticed a grey Opel there.

36:37.959 --> 36:41.959
A gal and some guy are
hanging around, so watch out for them.

36:41.959 --> 36:43.001
All right, thanks Stasiu.

36:44.709 --> 36:49.834
I want to open a paint store, and I know
I'll have to pay you, so I'm calling first.

36:50.042 --> 36:54.084
How about letting me pay less
and on better terms, ok?

36:57.709 --> 37:01.667
One telephone's given us
237 victims and 31 gangsters.

37:06.751 --> 37:09.459
Can I talk to Marcin?
He collects the cash from me,

37:09.459 --> 37:12.334
- and there's a problem.
- Hang on.

37:13.917 --> 37:18.209
- What's up? -Hi, honey, I'm calling
from Wrobel, the cafe you collect from.

37:18.834 --> 37:21.959
We've got a problem.
They're following my ex.

37:21.959 --> 37:25.251
I'm calling from a booth,
I might have a tail.

37:25.917 --> 37:29.084
They might be observing the cafe
and my phone might be tapped.

37:29.292 --> 37:33.167
So if you want to come for the cash,
we have to use someone.

37:33.334 --> 37:35.667
So you don't get caught and
so nothing happens to you.

37:39.542 --> 37:41.251
I don't pay protection money to anyone.

37:47.042 --> 37:50.126
"I'm calling from a booth,
I might have a tail..."

37:50.542 --> 37:53.792
"They might be observing the cafe
and my phone might be tapped..."

37:55.459 --> 37:56.876
And whose fucking voice is that?

38:00.667 --> 38:05.334
Bandits are taking your money,
and you even help them?

38:07.292 --> 38:09.709
If you want to lock me up,
then do it.

38:10.917 --> 38:15.167
If not, I'm not telling you
anything and I'm going home.

38:17.792 --> 38:19.959
Operational Technology Unit

38:20.126 --> 38:23.251
Classic Stockholm syndrome,
bonding with their captors.

38:24.876 --> 38:28.459
We're setting an ambush and we'd
like to borrow something nifty.

38:33.792 --> 38:38.001
Fuck me, we've got a nanny.
Am we supposed to talk about kids?

38:38.501 --> 38:40.251
Here's the camera. Look, look.

38:40.417 --> 38:41.542
Where do you turn it on, here?

38:41.751 --> 38:43.501
Here, and there's a lamp, look.

38:43.667 --> 38:45.209
Press it. I want to be filmed.

38:46.667 --> 38:48.001
Ok wait, we're rolling.

38:50.417 --> 38:53.001
Tonight should be relatively fantastic.

38:54.417 --> 38:57.501
Darek, I already have a nanny.

38:58.042 --> 39:00.626
- Maybe you'll read them a story?
- Want me to?

39:01.126 --> 39:04.584
- Sure we do.
- Oh great.

39:05.417 --> 39:07.917
Then read Pan Tadeusz,
because it'll be a while.

39:27.667 --> 39:29.459
Now you'll wait.

39:39.584 --> 39:40.917
Light it for me?

39:42.626 --> 39:43.542
Don't you you know how?

39:44.751 --> 39:46.667
It tastes better, don't you know?

40:00.876 --> 40:02.542
Ganja you're a fine mama.

40:11.584 --> 40:12.376
Know what?

40:15.292 --> 40:17.042
I feel as if I've known you
for ten years.

40:20.542 --> 40:21.334
Yeah?

40:23.709 --> 40:24.376
Yeah.

41:10.459 --> 41:11.709
What time is it?

41:12.626 --> 41:13.626
Eight.

41:14.334 --> 41:17.459
- How're doing, souse? -Fuck me.
Olka take me to work. The

41:17.459 --> 41:20.626
operation at the kebab! I have
to deliver the equipment.

41:20.876 --> 41:21.876
The equipment went long ago.

41:24.334 --> 41:26.292
Sleep, baby, sleep.

41:26.834 --> 41:28.834
You had 15 unanswered calls.

41:30.209 --> 41:32.501
I even showed them
how to use it.

41:34.084 --> 41:36.834
You're kidding, right?

41:47.667 --> 41:52.001
If they come to me, I'll cut off their
dicks and stuff them in their mouths.

42:05.251 --> 42:07.167
Yes?

42:07.417 --> 42:09.751
I was to tell something
to the boys in the back.

42:17.959 --> 42:19.209
Oh fuck!

42:23.667 --> 42:25.959
Maho, put it down; he's a cop.

42:26.376 --> 42:28.751
Excuse me, sorry, I'm sorry.

42:31.376 --> 42:34.626
You realize that another minute
and you would've been dead?

42:36.001 --> 42:39.001
- What'd you say to him?
- I had something to tell the boys.

42:40.667 --> 42:42.751
Maho, what'd you think he said?

42:42.834 --> 42:44.834
He was from the boys,
and I had to give him something.

42:45.459 --> 42:48.084
I thought he was a bandit, so
I wanted to cut his head off.

42:48.876 --> 42:51.042
I'm very sorry. Want a kebab?

42:54.251 --> 42:58.959
The cops have an ambush
at the kebab, so watch out.

42:59.292 --> 43:02.542
District Police Station
Ursynow District

43:18.751 --> 43:21.501
Nina, stop pole dancing, all right?

43:21.834 --> 43:24.626
- Why, can't I?
- No.

43:32.084 --> 43:33.834
All right, stop already.

43:35.001 --> 43:36.459
Come on, Nina.

43:42.126 --> 43:45.334
A vendor reports there's
an ambush at the kebab place.

43:50.334 --> 43:52.542
Nice, huh?

44:02.959 --> 44:05.751
Hello. We got a report
that thugs were demanding

44:05.751 --> 44:08.584
extortion money. Son, who
the fuck sent you here?

44:08.834 --> 44:10.459
- The dispatcher.
- The dispatcher?

44:14.126 --> 44:17.751
Two patrol cars fucking showed up at
my ambush. How the fuck did they know?

44:18.084 --> 44:20.917
A unit out of Ursynow
had the information.

44:21.126 --> 44:25.042
I came from officer Olgierd Knyg
alias "Gendarme."

44:25.751 --> 44:27.001
Give me his phone number..

44:28.334 --> 44:29.501
And something to write with.

44:31.376 --> 44:35.834
Get these cars out of here.
All of Mokotow knows we're here.

44:55.917 --> 44:58.084
- Talk to me.
- Miami from Mokotow. Where'd you get

44:58.084 --> 45:00.501
information that the kebab
owner was being extorted?

45:00.709 --> 45:05.042
Not from me, it's my partner Gendarme's
phone. He said he saw thugs there.

45:05.501 --> 45:08.667
Well, champ, how'd he know
the owner was being extorted?

45:08.917 --> 45:13.709
It wasn't me. Ask Gendarme.
He's got his own information.

45:14.167 --> 45:19.542
Tell Gendarme that if he fucks up
my operation again, he'll regret it.

45:48.626 --> 45:50.334
Central Police Headquarters
Internal Affairs Division

45:50.542 --> 45:53.792
I recorded a cop from Ursynow
when monitoring the Mokotow gang.

45:54.084 --> 45:59.542
- Gendarme, lift four cop uniforms.
- Send me the sizes.

46:02.667 --> 46:04.542
Thank you very much
for the information.

46:06.542 --> 46:07.459
That's all?

46:10.292 --> 46:11.709
Listen...

46:12.126 --> 46:13.667
We'll use this.

46:14.167 --> 46:17.001
It's another piece of evidence.

46:17.501 --> 46:19.584
Soon there'll be effects.

46:23.167 --> 46:24.084
All right.

46:27.876 --> 46:29.417
Hi, we've got the red car.

46:29.709 --> 46:33.501
We'll plant a phone and follow her,
so drive slowly around Ursynow.

46:33.959 --> 46:36.834
I'll call all units in for donuts
at the BP, and you can move.

46:41.917 --> 46:45.292
He says they're observing a
bitch in a red car at the

46:45.292 --> 46:48.542
station on the corner of
Pulawska and Ursynowska.

46:48.876 --> 46:51.584
And he said he'd give them
a clear ride through Ursynow.

46:51.876 --> 46:53.084
All right.

46:54.376 --> 46:56.792
Gas station on the corner
of Pulawska and Ursynowska.

47:08.459 --> 47:11.251
Anything fast tanked up here
in the last 15 minutes?

47:11.626 --> 47:14.959
- A red car?
- A girl in an orange Cayenne does.

47:39.251 --> 47:42.834
39200 to 39208.

47:44.167 --> 47:52.042
-08, Come in, 00. -Check the owner
of a Porsche, tag number WO04806.

48:01.334 --> 48:02.959
Police.

48:03.542 --> 48:07.126
Is the Cayenne WO04806
registered to you?

48:07.542 --> 48:09.167
- Yeah, to me.
- Who drives it?

48:10.001 --> 48:11.959
- My daughter.
- Call her.

48:12.334 --> 48:13.042
Why?

48:13.459 --> 48:15.167
Call or they'll kill her.

48:26.792 --> 48:27.709
Hello...

48:48.292 --> 48:51.084
Hello, miss.
Please turn off the engine.

48:52.251 --> 48:54.501
License and registration.

49:03.667 --> 49:06.084
Please come with me
to the patrol car.

49:27.251 --> 49:28.292
Hello.

49:28.959 --> 49:29.834
Hello.

49:34.334 --> 49:37.584
I don't have any points and
I've never gotten a ticket.

49:38.001 --> 49:39.376
I know I shouldn't
have used the phone.

49:39.376 --> 49:39.792
Excuse me.

49:41.126 --> 49:43.917
- My dad keeps calling.
- He loves you, huh?

49:46.626 --> 49:48.084
Yes.

49:50.292 --> 49:53.501
Then write, "Daddy,
I've been kidnapped.

49:54.376 --> 49:56.542
They'll send you a finger
that they cut off. If

49:56.542 --> 49:58.876
you don't pay a million
Euros, they'll kill me."

49:59.501 --> 50:03.751
Daddy: Iwonka, drive off!

50:15.709 --> 50:17.251
Pretty.

50:56.459 --> 51:01.917
If you've called the cops,
we'll kill her. I haven't called anywhere.

51:02.417 --> 51:04.001
I'm on the viaduct. Now what?

51:05.209 --> 51:09.792
Go the barrier and toss the bag
down on the grass.

51:28.334 --> 51:31.584
I've thrown it. When will you
release my daughter? Hello?

51:32.834 --> 51:33.334
Hello.

51:34.251 --> 51:34.751
Hello.

51:41.667 --> 51:42.751
Your daddy paid.

51:46.917 --> 51:48.376
We underestimated you.

52:00.084 --> 52:01.417
Are you studying anything?

52:04.001 --> 52:05.001
Sociology.

52:07.042 --> 52:08.792
- What are doing?
- A manicure.

52:14.626 --> 52:17.251
Don't worry about the finger.

52:17.834 --> 52:19.001
You're very pretty.

52:21.334 --> 52:23.667
I'd fuck you, but I've got a girl.

52:29.042 --> 52:32.584
We don't have time for recon;
we take him now.

52:36.834 --> 52:38.876
Police, open up! We're breaking

52:38.917 --> 52:41.292
down the door, get on the floor!

52:41.626 --> 52:44.167
Police, on the ground!

52:48.876 --> 52:51.626
Why the fuck are we sent in
with kids here?!

53:01.959 --> 53:03.334
It's all right.

53:10.834 --> 53:12.084
Are you hurt?

53:15.251 --> 53:17.667
- My name's Jacek. You?
- Jasiek.

53:20.459 --> 53:21.459
And you?

53:24.376 --> 53:25.292
Nina.

53:28.334 --> 53:29.501
Where are you from?

53:30.376 --> 53:31.167
Palace headquarters.

53:32.459 --> 53:34.209
What kind of palace?

53:36.417 --> 53:38.417
Not the one from Snow White.

53:39.584 --> 53:43.042
- Where are your parents?
- Their operation ran long.

53:44.417 --> 53:46.376
You really scared us.

53:48.459 --> 53:49.501
I'm sorry.

53:50.751 --> 53:53.751
You haven't done anything wrong,
but your brother has.

53:55.876 --> 53:56.834
We're looking for him.

53:57.584 --> 53:59.292
He has to tell us something.

54:00.292 --> 54:01.334
Do you know when he'll be back?

54:01.709 --> 54:04.001
He moved in with Hen yesterday.

54:05.917 --> 54:10.126
- I see, with a hen.
- Hen's his girlfriend.

54:19.626 --> 54:21.709
Soup knows you went to the police.

54:23.167 --> 54:25.876
I think the safest option
is to starve him.

54:26.417 --> 54:28.542
From wiretaps I know where he is,

54:29.126 --> 54:33.292
-but without your testimony, I won't put him
away. -What about the other gangsters?

54:34.626 --> 54:36.626
We don't have any protection
programs, but

54:37.126 --> 54:40.167
I'll have a team posted here 24/7.

54:41.376 --> 54:44.251
I know if you testify,
others will be willing.

54:57.209 --> 55:01.001
We're supporting traffic;
all phones stay in your rooms.

55:01.209 --> 55:04.417
Come to the briefing dressed,
with a shortwave and a balaclava

55:04.584 --> 55:08.334
After the briefing we get
in our cars and leave.

55:08.834 --> 55:13.459
I apologize to you all. I had to keep it
a secret, but we're not working with traffic.

55:13.792 --> 55:14.542
The Mokotow gang?

55:15.042 --> 55:15.917
Soup.

55:16.251 --> 55:18.667
The gang's always a step ahead
of us; they've got a mole inside.

55:19.042 --> 55:23.459
No phones. I don't want anyone
texting Soup that we're on our way.

55:23.667 --> 55:26.834
After which he splits or hides
goods that shouldn't be there.

55:27.001 --> 55:30.459
We don't know who we'll find.
Wear balaclavas, shots may be fired.

55:30.917 --> 55:34.167
If you have to shoot at gangsters
better they not know who you are.

55:34.751 --> 55:38.251
Central Police Headquarters
Operations Unit

56:16.542 --> 56:18.917
Second, don't use the radio.

56:19.126 --> 56:22.834
We've got it set to monitor only.
Soup's got a police scanner.

56:24.459 --> 56:27.834
We'll drive down Wilanowska
until you hear me say

56:28.167 --> 56:29.417
"turn."

56:29.709 --> 56:33.626
Soczek, Budyn, Bergus, and I drive up
in unmarked cars and park near the gate.

56:33.792 --> 56:36.001
Pretending to be drunk,
we approach the janitor's cubby.

56:36.209 --> 56:38.751
We know that Soup's got
the janitor on the payroll.

56:38.959 --> 56:41.792
He gave him 500 and told him
to let him know if he sees cops, so

56:42.334 --> 56:43.876
we definitely put the janitors
on the ground.

56:44.084 --> 56:46.167
I'll raise the barrier so
the SWAT boys can drive in.

58:08.917 --> 58:11.376
Police!
Move away from the blinds.

58:13.001 --> 58:14.292
Step aside!

58:15.792 --> 58:20.376
The second unit is blocked at the window
by security shutters made of rubber.

58:35.876 --> 58:39.126
Police, open the door!

58:41.126 --> 58:43.959
- All right, I'm opening it.
- Then fucking open it now!

58:47.876 --> 58:50.334
- You've damaged the lock.
- Move you hand.

58:52.209 --> 58:54.417
Go ahead, press.

59:05.917 --> 59:12.001
Even though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

59:12.584 --> 59:18.542
I will fear no evil,
for you are with me;

59:19.167 --> 59:24.792
your rod and your staff,
they comfort me.

59:25.792 --> 59:26.751
Gas!

59:28.334 --> 59:31.584
Police, police, police!

59:40.126 --> 59:41.417
This is the terror of Mokotow?

59:47.209 --> 59:48.001
Hi, Oskar.

59:50.292 --> 59:51.542
I expected this.

59:54.334 --> 59:55.792
From me?

59:57.626 --> 59:58.876
From you the most, Darek.

01:00:00.334 --> 01:00:02.751
Oskar, how do you know my name?

01:00:03.334 --> 01:00:05.251
We've never laid eyes on each other.

01:00:06.001 --> 01:00:10.376
Everyone knows you're a secret
agent, who hates Mokotow.

01:00:14.042 --> 01:00:15.084
Take him away.

01:00:28.876 --> 01:00:30.459
Soup's a vodka collector.

01:00:31.042 --> 01:00:33.209
We'll party later.
No drinking now.

01:00:34.209 --> 01:00:35.376
About two kilos of gold.

01:00:35.876 --> 01:00:38.042
And a police scanner.

01:00:38.584 --> 01:00:40.709
But it's set for Piaseczno.

01:00:41.376 --> 01:00:44.209
I don't know why it isn't set for Mokotow.
We'll check the garage.

01:00:44.501 --> 01:00:46.334
All right, and rip up
the paving bricks.

01:00:52.459 --> 01:00:55.917
- No weapons or narcotics, but...
- He dumped the goods.

01:00:56.292 --> 01:00:59.626
Soup bought a furnished apartment,
and spent three days redoing it.

01:01:00.209 --> 01:01:03.542
He's got mirrors, drywall
around the tub, and shelves.

01:01:03.917 --> 01:01:06.501
I'll admit I'm itching to do
some digging here.

01:01:06.917 --> 01:01:09.376
The son of a bitch furnished
his flat with extortion money.

01:01:09.626 --> 01:01:13.542
Miami, you can demolish it,
but you've got one assignment.

01:01:13.751 --> 01:01:14.667
What's that?

01:01:15.834 --> 01:01:17.542
- Don't tear down the building.
- Ok, thanks.

01:01:20.709 --> 01:01:21.834
Here we go.

01:01:38.667 --> 01:01:39.584
Darek!

01:01:41.376 --> 01:01:45.209
The corner's chipped. As if the glass
has been taken out and put back.

01:02:11.709 --> 01:02:13.292
Different names on the IDs.

01:02:15.959 --> 01:02:17.834
Nothing in the garage.

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:27.501
Hello.

01:02:36.167 --> 01:02:37.667
Quiet!

01:02:38.084 --> 01:02:40.709
The janitor says Soup's
bitch broke the seals, went

01:02:40.709 --> 01:02:43.459
into his apartment, and left
the garage carrying a bag.

01:02:53.042 --> 01:02:55.459
- Did you check the baby seat?
- Check how?

01:02:55.667 --> 01:02:58.751
Did you cut it open? It's empty,
and you can hide stuff inside.

01:02:59.001 --> 01:03:00.126
No, I didn't.

01:03:03.251 --> 01:03:04.792
Fuck, she cut out the bottom.

01:03:05.542 --> 01:03:08.501
I said to search everything.
What the fuck is this?

01:03:14.376 --> 01:03:16.792
Hi, why haven't you called?

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:19.292
Know what, Olga? I don't think
we're a good match.

01:03:23.751 --> 01:03:24.626
Darek.

01:03:26.001 --> 01:03:28.501
You can't tell me on the phone
that we're not a good match.

01:03:28.917 --> 01:03:30.959
How can a man not be a match
for a woman?

01:03:31.376 --> 01:03:33.334
Two halves of an orange.
What do you want?

01:03:33.792 --> 01:03:36.834
This is important. Don't you
fucking believe in destiny?

01:03:41.834 --> 01:03:42.709
Where do you get your money?

01:03:42.959 --> 01:03:45.917
Rich parents and child support.

01:03:46.251 --> 01:03:47.459
From a gangsta from Ozarow.

01:03:47.792 --> 01:03:49.251
Are you fucking interrogating me?

01:03:49.501 --> 01:03:52.001
When I checked your record
the printer ran out of paper. And?

01:03:53.042 --> 01:03:54.751
I don't have anything
to do with that now.

01:03:55.251 --> 01:03:56.709
Don't you have a past?

01:03:57.167 --> 01:03:58.626
- So?
- So.

01:03:59.626 --> 01:04:02.501
Fuck, Darek, we're made
for each other.

01:04:02.876 --> 01:04:04.251
Can't you see that?

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:09.792
You love kids, I've got 'em.
You want to be a dad, I need one.

01:04:11.501 --> 01:04:13.001
And the sex was fucking great.

01:04:14.667 --> 01:04:15.876
It's destiny.

01:04:16.417 --> 01:04:21.834
I could've bought something else.
Someone else could've come to me.

01:04:23.667 --> 01:04:24.459
I love you.

01:04:25.459 --> 01:04:27.459
Maybe you don't love me
yet, but when we get

01:04:27.459 --> 01:04:29.542
to know each other.
You'll see how I wake up.

01:04:29.876 --> 01:04:31.376
How I sit on the toilet.

01:04:32.667 --> 01:04:35.001
I'll see which hand you eat with.

01:04:36.084 --> 01:04:38.584
If we have to change the door handles.

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:41.667
- You smoke dope, and I don't.
- Then I don't either.

01:04:42.459 --> 01:04:44.542
- Olka I find a new piece of
ass every week. -But they

01:04:44.542 --> 01:04:46.792
- don't make you sandwiches for lunch.
- Yes, they do.

01:04:47.251 --> 01:04:49.459
- But not with cucumber.
- Fuck.

01:04:56.209 --> 01:04:57.042
Password.

01:05:08.001 --> 01:05:10.709
Police, freeze! On the ground.

01:05:35.834 --> 01:05:40.209
Fuck me. A 120 meter flat, and
he shows up with a backpack.

01:05:40.626 --> 01:05:43.834
I'll make you some space
in the shoe cabinet.

01:05:46.251 --> 01:05:47.209
Hi.

01:05:50.501 --> 01:05:52.626
- You remembered.
- You bet.

01:06:02.751 --> 01:06:04.251
I've been listening to Soup
since September.

01:06:05.751 --> 01:06:07.626
How'd you get his new address?

01:06:09.709 --> 01:06:10.709
Wiretap.

01:06:11.126 --> 01:06:14.084
On a phone starting with 507?

01:06:15.292 --> 01:06:16.126
603.

01:06:18.292 --> 01:06:20.626
Know why I treated you
like a nerd?

01:06:22.084 --> 01:06:24.792
We're working the same gang.
You extortioon, and I...

01:06:25.459 --> 01:06:26.626
those who cut off fingers.

01:06:27.792 --> 01:06:30.334
They kidnapped 41 people in Warsaw.

01:06:30.834 --> 01:06:32.084
All had fingers cut off.

01:06:32.834 --> 01:06:34.584
Sent to their families for ransom.

01:06:37.334 --> 01:06:38.751
A university student.

01:06:40.542 --> 01:06:42.792
The daughter of Joreno
the sausage man.

01:06:43.501 --> 01:06:45.584
A Pakistani flush with dough.

01:06:47.376 --> 01:06:48.542
Alias "Pig?"

01:06:50.042 --> 01:06:53.501
Yeah pig, dirty business, dirty hands.

01:06:54.834 --> 01:06:58.167
The Mokotow gang kidnapped all 41.

01:07:00.417 --> 01:07:03.834
They let 34 go, after the
families paid, of course.

01:07:06.417 --> 01:07:10.751
I found the hole they were kept in
after logging on with Soup's phone.

01:07:11.501 --> 01:07:13.584
Unfortunately, it was empty.

01:07:15.626 --> 01:07:17.542
I can't find seven people.

01:07:20.667 --> 01:07:22.876
If you hadn't treated me like shit,
maybe you wouldn't be looking.

01:07:25.334 --> 01:07:27.167
You didn't have to say that.

01:07:30.417 --> 01:07:32.917
But, ok, I've got a proposition.

01:07:34.501 --> 01:07:37.584
You do your wiretaps, I do mine.

01:07:39.042 --> 01:07:42.251
If something important for
either of us comes up,

01:07:43.084 --> 01:07:45.292
we exchange information. Ok?

01:07:47.876 --> 01:07:48.834
Ok.

01:07:50.917 --> 01:07:53.001
Maho, someone's at the door!

01:07:57.334 --> 01:08:01.042
- What is it?
- Security, your car's alarm is on.

01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:33.001
Hello?

01:09:33.959 --> 01:09:36.001
Are you a policeman?

01:09:38.751 --> 01:09:40.834
Yes. Who's calling?

01:09:44.084 --> 01:09:46.251
My mom's dead.

01:09:46.751 --> 01:09:50.501
She isn't moving.
I think my dad is, too.

01:09:51.751 --> 01:09:56.667
He's in the bathroom
and doesn't answer.

01:09:58.417 --> 01:09:59.542
Are you calling from
the flat on Pulawska?

01:10:00.209 --> 01:10:02.501
Your mama is Andzia and
daddy Maho?

01:10:05.376 --> 01:10:07.084
I'll be right there to get you.

01:10:07.667 --> 01:10:11.959
Just promise that you'll wait
and won't call anyone else, ok?

01:10:12.209 --> 01:10:14.459
I promise.

01:10:21.501 --> 01:10:23.084
You left the child inside.

01:10:34.334 --> 01:10:36.501
The security camera recording.

01:10:37.292 --> 01:10:39.792
That was the last time
the girl was seen.

01:10:46.001 --> 01:10:47.751
You lost a witness.

01:10:53.584 --> 01:10:59.126
You won't put Soup away
for long for fake IDs.

01:10:59.876 --> 01:11:03.167
We'll tack on the fingers,
but his lawyer will

01:11:03.376 --> 01:11:06.459
get him out before we
have all the evidence.

01:11:10.084 --> 01:11:10.626
Hello?

01:11:11.792 --> 01:11:14.542
All right.

01:11:17.834 --> 01:11:21.542
I'll try pressuring Soup's bitch.

01:11:22.292 --> 01:11:24.126
You do what you can, too.
Let's go.

01:11:30.584 --> 01:11:32.084
Are you fucking nuts?

01:11:33.126 --> 01:11:35.292
Your brain's fried.

01:11:37.667 --> 01:11:39.501
You sleep with a gangster.

01:11:40.584 --> 01:11:42.042
You're faithful to him.

01:11:43.584 --> 01:11:45.334
And he's cheating on you.

01:11:46.126 --> 01:11:47.251
He treats you like a cunt.

01:11:58.209 --> 01:11:59.376
You'd like that, huh?

01:12:03.417 --> 01:12:05.292
Hen won't be jealous,

01:12:05.959 --> 01:12:10.042
the coed just sucked my dick.
Like jacking off using her head.

01:12:11.834 --> 01:12:14.042
He's fallen in love
with a student,

01:12:15.042 --> 01:12:16.376
who he kidnapped himself.

01:12:17.876 --> 01:12:19.584
Eight years younger than you.

01:12:24.084 --> 01:12:25.917
Still want to keep lying.

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:27.917
And covering?

01:13:22.501 --> 01:13:24.709
Zdzisiu give me 50 for the fine.

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:27.167
No fines today.
Pack up and get the fuck out.

01:13:27.334 --> 01:13:29.917
You've got half an hour.
Then we seize your goods and arrest you.

01:13:30.459 --> 01:13:33.417
It's worth 40,000. If I don't
sell it, it'll rot. If you

01:13:33.417 --> 01:13:36.501
don't let me work the weekend,
I'll lose all that money.

01:13:37.042 --> 01:13:40.667
What's more, I'll lose liquidity
and my business will be fucked.

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:43.334
Remember when I told you it's
better to be on our side than

01:13:43.334 --> 01:13:45.542
that of the bandits?. I asked
you three times. No more.

01:13:45.917 --> 01:13:48.209
I can't, I've got a wife and kids.

01:13:48.542 --> 01:13:51.709
- They'll fucking kill me.
- We're police, not Boy Scouts.

01:13:52.001 --> 01:13:54.709
You've got two choices. Talk, and
I lock up them up. Or you don't

01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:57.542
and stay a source of income for
them, so you have to be eliminated.

01:13:57.834 --> 01:14:01.834
If this is illegal, it's fucking over.
I will fucking finish you.

01:14:02.501 --> 01:14:05.834
- Don't finish me, don't.
- I'll kill you with the guards.

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:12.001
Man, I've already dug my grave.
Ever dug your own grave?

01:14:15.334 --> 01:14:20.459
Listen to me. As long as I'm on the force,
you won't be harmed.

01:14:26.876 --> 01:14:29.167
- Hey, tourist, where you going?
- Fuck you.

01:14:31.417 --> 01:14:33.959
- Back to the resort, queer.
- Queer?

01:14:34.459 --> 01:14:36.709
I'll fucking kill you!

01:14:37.084 --> 01:14:40.042
- I'll fucking kill you.
- When you get out in 2041.

01:14:48.334 --> 01:14:51.167
- I didn't hear him threaten you.
- Are you a member of the bar?

01:14:52.417 --> 01:14:55.167
- Go fuck yourself.
- Excuse me?

01:15:21.292 --> 01:15:22.251
What's up?

01:15:22.876 --> 01:15:24.876
The boss of Mokotow.

01:15:26.167 --> 01:15:28.501
Take out your lightning stick
and pump him full of lead.

01:15:28.751 --> 01:15:29.792
Don't say anything.

01:15:49.126 --> 01:15:52.501
Toss me the mooring line.

01:16:46.459 --> 01:16:47.626
Thanks.

01:16:56.751 --> 01:16:58.792
MIAMI'S A PRICK

01:17:03.042 --> 01:17:05.292
- Yeah?
- It's me, they've grabbed me.

01:17:05.501 --> 01:17:07.292
Fuck, Zdzisiek, where?

01:17:07.626 --> 01:17:10.417
- I'm going downtown.
- Where'd you get the phone?

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:12.751
I had a second one hidden on me
and they didn't find it.

01:17:13.501 --> 01:17:14.334
How do you know where you're going?

01:17:14.876 --> 01:17:16.626
- Because they told me.
- The fucking gangstas told you?

01:17:17.001 --> 01:17:19.584
No, the municipal guard.

01:17:22.126 --> 01:17:24.542
Fuck, Zdzislaw, you want me to
have a fucking hear attack?

01:17:25.126 --> 01:17:26.334
Are you fucking stupid?

01:17:26.959 --> 01:17:28.167
What station are they taking you to?

01:17:28.834 --> 01:17:30.834
Word's out that Zdzisiek
has talked.

01:17:31.126 --> 01:17:32.751
They'll try getting revenge.

01:17:33.417 --> 01:17:34.792
Barszczyk is fucked as protection.

01:17:35.084 --> 01:17:38.167
I wrote to the police station
where Zdzisiek lives.

01:17:38.626 --> 01:17:42.042
I explained the situation and asked
them to put him on surveillance 24/7.

01:17:42.626 --> 01:17:46.792
They said that area isn't even
covered by normal patrols.

01:17:47.251 --> 01:17:49.376
If someone calls the police,
they come in an hour.

01:17:50.459 --> 01:17:52.126
I don't want a repeat of Ania.

01:17:55.501 --> 01:17:57.792
I have a buddy who lives
in the woods.

01:17:58.334 --> 01:18:00.292
The police chief in Wegrow.

01:18:01.709 --> 01:18:03.626
30 kilometers from there.

01:18:05.709 --> 01:18:07.167
Local Headquarters
Wegrow Police Department

01:18:07.292 --> 01:18:08.751
I've read your email.

01:18:08.792 --> 01:18:10.876
I know about the Mokotow gang.

01:18:11.042 --> 01:18:12.959
Where that guy lives

01:18:13.292 --> 01:18:15.251
also live two of my officers.

01:18:15.334 --> 01:18:17.709
One's a neighborhood cop,
but the other's from criminal.

01:18:17.792 --> 01:18:20.959
I'll order both to take
their weapons home with them.

01:18:23.667 --> 01:18:24.751
Pick the one you want.

01:18:26.834 --> 01:18:27.459
That one.

01:18:30.417 --> 01:18:31.292
Wrong.

01:18:34.917 --> 01:18:35.751
Look.

01:18:44.417 --> 01:18:46.042
Take this one.

01:18:46.751 --> 01:18:47.959
His name's Luger.

01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:50.209
There are three training stages.

01:18:50.751 --> 01:18:52.251
First he tears up a rabbit.

01:18:52.542 --> 01:18:53.792
Two months later a goose.

01:18:54.126 --> 01:18:55.084
Finally a sheep..

01:18:55.376 --> 01:18:57.042
The sheep's the toughest, but

01:18:57.501 --> 01:18:59.001
a goose flaps those wings,

01:18:59.376 --> 01:19:00.334
and also hard to kill.

01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:02.834
You'll see how he hates animals.

01:19:03.459 --> 01:19:06.042
When he kills the rabbit
he sits on him,

01:19:06.334 --> 01:19:07.459
and you can't take it from him.

01:19:09.001 --> 01:19:09.876
Why not?

01:19:10.209 --> 01:19:11.917
He'll be disappointed.

01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:13.834
It's his prey.

01:19:14.542 --> 01:19:17.376
He can share it with you
as a friend, but it's his.

01:19:17.667 --> 01:19:20.626
You'll see what an instinct
he has in four weeks.

01:19:28.167 --> 01:19:29.376
I don't think I'll train him.

01:19:41.417 --> 01:19:43.167
Hi?

01:19:43.584 --> 01:19:47.334
Miami, the whole street's dark,
and some car's parked outside.

01:19:49.126 --> 01:19:49.501
Hang on.

01:19:50.167 --> 01:19:52.709
Can't you tell them you're
asleep at this hour?

01:19:53.084 --> 01:19:56.167
How can I tell them I'm asleep
when I answered the phone?

01:20:00.459 --> 01:20:01.542
Hi, what is it?

01:20:01.751 --> 01:20:06.251
My man says the lights are out and
a car's parked outside his house.

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:08.542
All right, give me a minute.

01:20:21.001 --> 01:20:24.626
My neighbour's got a gun; he's running
at them in his fucking pajamas.

01:20:24.834 --> 01:20:28.376
Understand? Pajamas, rubber boots,
shotgun, and fucking running to them.

01:20:28.626 --> 01:20:30.459
I've never seen anything like it.

01:20:32.876 --> 01:20:36.042
- What the fuck?
- Stop, police!

01:20:38.376 --> 01:20:40.251
They're fucking driving away.

01:20:41.959 --> 01:20:44.417
They smacked into a tree.

01:20:51.667 --> 01:20:54.709
Smashed half the fucking car.

01:21:11.417 --> 01:21:14.459
Chief, they cut the power line,
that's why there were no lights.

01:21:17.876 --> 01:21:20.001
Fear, I'm Zbyszek from Plonsk.

01:21:20.501 --> 01:21:23.459
I'm asking for a franchise.
A sucker from Plonsk owes us money.

01:21:23.917 --> 01:21:25.834
We'd like to pay him a visit
as the Mokotow gang.

01:21:26.126 --> 01:21:29.751
He'll shit his pants.
Half of what I get is yours. Deal?

01:21:33.501 --> 01:21:35.042
- Are you hereto see the healer?
- Yeah.

01:21:37.542 --> 01:21:39.084
We're not going to wait.
We have to crash the line.

01:21:40.876 --> 01:21:41.876
People will start yelling.

01:21:42.501 --> 01:21:45.501
The shaman will get all pissed off.

01:21:47.417 --> 01:21:49.626
Dad, I think I feel a tingling.

01:21:49.626 --> 01:21:51.834
- I have to use a bedpan.
- All right, just a minute.

01:21:52.209 --> 01:21:54.292
Come on. Help me take him
to the field.

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:55.834
We're in line here.

01:22:04.751 --> 01:22:05.542
Hello.

01:22:05.959 --> 01:22:08.876
Kazek here. Some fucking
guy named Zbigniew is here

01:22:08.876 --> 01:22:11.709
claiming to be from Plonsk
and the Mokotow gang.

01:22:12.084 --> 01:22:14.709
I don't know the fuckers.
Fuck them over.

01:22:27.876 --> 01:22:29.709
Look at all the peaches
you have to ruin

01:22:30.751 --> 01:22:32.584
to get one pack of almonds.

01:22:33.334 --> 01:22:34.542
Those aren't almonds.

01:22:35.209 --> 01:22:37.042
They grow on almond trees.

01:22:37.792 --> 01:22:39.167
So if it's a sandalwood tree,

01:22:39.667 --> 01:22:40.626
do sandals grow on it?

01:22:42.542 --> 01:22:45.001
Are Zbigniew and Zbyszek the same name?

01:22:45.876 --> 01:22:47.459
A Zbyszek came for a franchise today.

01:22:48.459 --> 01:22:49.876
- Now they called about a Zbigniew.
- The same.

01:22:53.876 --> 01:22:56.167
Hey, Kazyk, I fucked up the names.
Zbigniew is ok.

01:22:56.584 --> 01:22:57.876
Yeah, but he's all busted up already.

01:22:58.667 --> 01:23:00.876
Fuck it! Tell him it was
a misunderstanding.

01:23:04.292 --> 01:23:06.042
Not every guy with
a pitchfork is Zeus.

01:23:07.501 --> 01:23:08.376
Or fucking Neptune.

01:23:12.292 --> 01:23:13.501
Hello.

01:23:13.959 --> 01:23:15.542
My son's here to be healed.

01:23:17.084 --> 01:23:20.667
I won't help you; you live off
harming others. You can go in.

01:23:22.792 --> 01:23:24.876
Fuck me, did you hear her?
What the fuck was that?

01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:26.167
Should I burn her?

01:23:28.167 --> 01:23:31.292
Send a construction crew over and have
them build a little chapel by her house.

01:23:31.667 --> 01:23:34.209
And get 50 boys together;
we're going to a game in Poznan.

01:23:34.917 --> 01:23:37.251
There is one thing that
we all know!

01:23:37.751 --> 01:23:40.042
The thing that counts
in life is yo!

01:23:40.251 --> 01:23:45.251
Lech from Poznan, blue and white!

01:23:47.792 --> 01:23:50.126
You fuck.

01:24:06.501 --> 01:24:08.709
Not in the head or
he'll stop talking.

01:24:12.084 --> 01:24:14.792
Name of the punk who
hit the kid in the train?

01:24:15.292 --> 01:24:16.209
I don't know.

01:24:19.709 --> 01:24:21.042
His name?

01:24:27.042 --> 01:24:28.209
Not in the head.

01:24:32.876 --> 01:24:35.167
I can't look at blood, so
I'm swinging blind.

01:24:35.542 --> 01:24:37.251
It's fucking hard to aim.

01:24:38.167 --> 01:24:40.626
- Let someone else do it.
- Wait.

01:24:41.292 --> 01:24:42.584
I'll cut him down.

01:24:43.167 --> 01:24:44.376
I'll stand on his head.

01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:48.709
Then I'll be sure I'm beating him,
not just bashing his head.

01:24:49.959 --> 01:24:50.792
All right.

01:25:03.917 --> 01:25:04.792
Wait.

01:25:07.209 --> 01:25:08.001
What?

01:25:08.834 --> 01:25:10.584
Gentlemen.

01:25:11.334 --> 01:25:13.084
Understand...

01:25:13.542 --> 01:25:16.209
If I talk, they'll kill me.

01:25:17.501 --> 01:25:20.667
And I'll be a sucker
for the rest of my life.

01:25:26.834 --> 01:25:29.084
Well, boys, what do you say?
A little fucking respect, huh?

01:25:30.001 --> 01:25:32.126
We've wailed on him for an hour,
and he hasn't broken.

01:25:33.126 --> 01:25:34.876
We'll leave him here and get
the fuck back to Warsaw.

01:25:39.751 --> 01:25:41.959
There's a road a kilometer
from here.

01:25:51.251 --> 01:25:52.417
Think he made it?

01:25:58.126 --> 01:25:59.376
What'd you say?

01:26:09.376 --> 01:26:10.876
He made 30 centimeters
in an hour.

01:26:11.792 --> 01:26:13.084
But in the wrong direction.

01:26:13.709 --> 01:26:14.334
Grab him.

01:26:29.292 --> 01:26:31.917
You've got a bus at 18:20.

01:26:32.292 --> 01:26:33.209
Somebody will notice you.

01:26:40.292 --> 01:26:41.001
Mom?

01:26:45.667 --> 01:26:46.584
Mom!

01:26:51.959 --> 01:26:52.876
Mom?

01:27:00.084 --> 01:27:02.542
The business trip to Poznan
was a massacre.

01:27:04.626 --> 01:27:06.292
I couldn't reach you.

01:27:07.459 --> 01:27:08.792
The meeting ran long.

01:27:10.667 --> 01:27:12.376
I found your company
on the Internet.

01:27:13.459 --> 01:27:15.001
Nobody's ever seen you there.

01:27:49.376 --> 01:27:51.834
- Homework done, Olek?
- Of course.

01:27:52.126 --> 01:27:53.584
- Not lying?
- No way.

01:27:55.667 --> 01:27:59.167
First I'll work your legs
then your arms and torso.

01:28:00.792 --> 01:28:01.792
I'm out of the can.

01:28:02.501 --> 01:28:04.167
Did you work on my turf?

01:28:05.209 --> 01:28:07.126
You'll get the fuck out
of my area,

01:28:07.709 --> 01:28:09.792
and give back all you made.

01:28:11.334 --> 01:28:14.251
Didn't you get newspapers?
Never heard of the Mokotow gang?

01:28:14.459 --> 01:28:15.417
So what?

01:28:15.751 --> 01:28:16.917
Want to fight with me?

01:28:17.834 --> 01:28:19.042
Want to shoot it outwith me?

01:28:20.626 --> 01:28:22.001
And scare me with what?

01:28:22.751 --> 01:28:24.376
Who cares about the Mokotow gang?

01:28:25.334 --> 01:28:26.376
I'm from Chechnya.

01:28:28.834 --> 01:28:30.251
You can't scare me.

01:28:31.292 --> 01:28:32.917
That's all I have to tell you.

01:28:48.542 --> 01:28:50.834
Shall I look for a new therapist?

01:28:57.751 --> 01:29:00.709
He attacked me.
I'll take him to the hospital.

01:29:10.792 --> 01:29:12.584
Wait, you fuckers!

01:30:46.501 --> 01:30:50.417
Prior to prison Salman owed money
to a group in Pomerania.

01:30:51.667 --> 01:30:54.626
They've kidnapped him and
are demanding 100,000 euros.

01:30:57.584 --> 01:31:00.709
If Salman's Chechnya boys
handle it, we'll never get him.

01:31:02.876 --> 01:31:04.917
Can you get your hands
on that kind of money?

01:31:11.751 --> 01:31:12.876
I'm sorry.

01:31:17.126 --> 01:31:18.792
We're on the viaduct.

01:31:19.792 --> 01:31:21.501
What do we do?

01:31:22.167 --> 01:31:23.792
All right, we'll throw it.

01:31:25.626 --> 01:31:26.626
Toss it.

01:31:27.334 --> 01:31:28.751
Toss it.

01:31:50.792 --> 01:31:52.251
Everything will be fine.

01:32:08.501 --> 01:32:10.459
My wife wants a divorce.

01:32:11.126 --> 01:32:12.459
But there's good news.

01:32:13.001 --> 01:32:13.959
I met a nice piece of ass.

01:32:14.667 --> 01:32:15.626
She's got a kid.

01:32:16.001 --> 01:32:16.917
But fuck it.

01:32:17.126 --> 01:32:18.167
I can adopt it.

01:32:18.834 --> 01:32:20.209
Just so we get hitched.

01:32:21.376 --> 01:32:22.251
There's more.

01:32:23.084 --> 01:32:29.626
I'll take her husband's name.
That goat fucker from the hills.

01:32:30.042 --> 01:32:34.001
- They'll have to fish him out.
- I'll fucking kill you.

01:32:35.042 --> 01:32:36.626
Shame to waste good wire.

01:32:45.584 --> 01:32:48.334
A showdown with the goat-fuckers
at 4:00 p.m. at the Field.

01:32:48.834 --> 01:32:51.251
We're attracting them by calling
for "Salman's turds" to show up.

01:32:51.792 --> 01:32:53.917
We'll have it outwith them.
Come pick up the weapons.

01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:59.251
In an hour there's going to be
a shootout with the Chechens.

01:33:01.834 --> 01:33:03.042
Listen.

01:33:03.834 --> 01:33:06.334
Relations have changed a bit.

01:33:06.959 --> 01:33:11.626
Mokotow Field is actually
in the Ochota district.

01:33:12.334 --> 01:33:14.209
Why don't we let them handle it?

01:33:28.042 --> 01:33:30.167
Regional Police Headquarters Ill
Ochota, Ursus, Wlochy

01:33:30.667 --> 01:33:33.959
A showdown with the goat-fuckers
at 4:00 p.m. at the Field.

01:33:34.417 --> 01:33:36.209
All right, I'll call the SWAT boys.

01:33:39.709 --> 01:33:44.667
There's going to be a shootout at Mokotow
Field in 30 minutes. Can you make it?

01:33:45.626 --> 01:33:46.417
What?

01:33:47.417 --> 01:33:49.417
I see. All right, bye.

01:33:50.459 --> 01:33:52.626
SWAT can't make it.
They've got an operation going

01:33:52.626 --> 01:33:54.584
on, and the second shift
is just coming on.

01:33:55.001 --> 01:33:58.542
Sir, I've got a direct line to the anti-terror
unit. I'll call and they'll be there.

01:33:59.001 --> 01:34:02.376
The chief won't let us use them.
We have our own operational unit.

01:34:03.417 --> 01:34:06.876
Sir, human lives are at stake.
There could be innocent victims.

01:34:07.542 --> 01:34:11.251
All right, I'll send three patrol cars.

01:34:11.459 --> 01:34:14.084
They'll drive around and
maybe scare them off.

01:34:14.376 --> 01:34:15.376
Is this how you fucking
catch bandits?

01:34:29.542 --> 01:34:32.167
Police! On the ground!

01:34:33.042 --> 01:34:35.126
Get down!.

01:34:36.959 --> 01:34:39.626
Lie down, you fuck, and eyes on me!

01:34:40.042 --> 01:34:41.542
On the ground!

01:34:43.042 --> 01:34:44.626
Down! Look at me.

01:34:44.792 --> 01:34:45.792
Look at me.

01:34:46.334 --> 01:34:48.626
Lie still, head down.

01:34:49.584 --> 01:34:52.292
Guys, I'm a policeman.

01:34:52.584 --> 01:34:55.001
Lie fucking still.

01:34:57.334 --> 01:34:59.917
What are you doing with these
thugs, you fucking scumbag?

01:34:59.917 --> 01:35:02.376
A while ago you were pumped,
and now what, you fuck?

01:35:02.876 --> 01:35:05.251
You piece of shit. Are you a cop?

01:35:05.959 --> 01:35:07.501
Decide! Either you're a cop,

01:35:07.959 --> 01:35:09.417
or you're a fucking gangster.

01:35:20.834 --> 01:35:22.167
I'll tell you everything.

01:35:23.334 --> 01:35:27.334
I'll tell you what the gang's done
and what their plans are.

01:35:27.876 --> 01:35:31.084
I want to cop a plea;
talk to the prosecutor.

01:35:35.876 --> 01:35:38.959
- The venal cop's copping a plea?
- Yeah.

01:35:39.417 --> 01:35:42.167
Will he give us enough
to jail Fear?

01:35:42.501 --> 01:35:43.876
Yeah, but I don't know
where fear is.

01:35:44.251 --> 01:35:46.334
I've got him located.

01:35:46.709 --> 01:35:48.584
Thanks to a big mouth
pitbull breeder.

01:35:48.959 --> 01:35:50.542
But I don't have evidence
to go to trial.

01:35:51.667 --> 01:35:53.292
I'd like you to nail him.

01:35:53.792 --> 01:35:56.542
I'll set him up for you, and
you arrest him on what you've got.

01:35:56.917 --> 01:35:58.667
Later I'll add our charges.

01:35:59.334 --> 01:36:01.209
Once he's in the can.

01:36:07.001 --> 01:36:08.292
Call your dog off.

01:36:08.542 --> 01:36:10.667
Call the dog off or
I'll call the police.

01:36:11.042 --> 01:36:13.084
What fucking police?
What police?!

01:36:13.334 --> 01:36:15.209
He's a normal fucking dog.

01:36:16.376 --> 01:36:17.167
What kind of fur is it?

01:36:17.501 --> 01:36:19.334
- Rabbit. -Police! On the ground!
On the ground! Look at me!

01:36:44.334 --> 01:36:45.376
What the fuck is this?

01:36:45.959 --> 01:36:47.084
That's my own money.

01:36:47.376 --> 01:36:49.084
Wanted to pick up the
payments yourself?

01:36:50.042 --> 01:36:51.209
Could you take,

01:36:52.792 --> 01:36:53.917
your boot off my face?

01:36:54.834 --> 01:36:55.876
Geez, don't cry.

01:36:56.209 --> 01:36:57.042
Now you're crying?

01:36:57.292 --> 01:36:59.209
A minute ago you were a hero.
Show me where your balls are.

01:36:59.709 --> 01:37:01.001
Come on, where are your balls?

01:37:01.251 --> 01:37:02.167
Jump on a cop.

01:37:02.501 --> 01:37:04.709
Like you do people at the bazaar.
Cuff him.

01:37:05.584 --> 01:37:06.626
Officer...

01:37:06.876 --> 01:37:08.709
How about a tangerine or banana?

01:37:15.501 --> 01:37:18.084
Here you are, sir. Enjoy!

01:37:29.376 --> 01:37:31.417
My hands are softer than
Paddington Bear's.

01:37:31.709 --> 01:37:33.459
As if I hadn't worked a day
in my life.

01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:35.501
- Know what's the funniest?
- What?

01:37:35.917 --> 01:37:38.834
You can't imagine the information
I've gotten.

01:37:39.209 --> 01:37:42.792
The hairdressers and manicurists
know more than any informant.

01:37:43.126 --> 01:37:47.042
I know everything that's
going on at the bazaar.

01:37:47.959 --> 01:37:49.001
How's it going, Batman?

01:37:50.126 --> 01:37:50.917
Smile.

01:37:51.251 --> 01:37:53.876
In a bad mood or just naturally shy?

01:37:55.626 --> 01:37:56.417
Marcin.

01:37:58.126 --> 01:37:59.584
You don't want to do time.

01:38:00.501 --> 01:38:01.959
Then give me something.

01:38:04.751 --> 01:38:06.084
Become an informer.

01:38:06.501 --> 01:38:07.334
Redeem yourself.

01:38:08.376 --> 01:38:09.667
I don't talk to cops.

01:38:10.792 --> 01:38:12.001
Marcin.

01:38:12.251 --> 01:38:13.751
Turn state's evidence.

01:38:15.001 --> 01:38:16.251
I won't say a thing.

01:38:16.584 --> 01:38:22.126
Man, the time of loyalty is over.
Think your friends are loyal?

01:38:22.751 --> 01:38:23.834
I'm not talking.

01:38:24.251 --> 01:38:26.459
Today I arrested this guy,

01:38:26.792 --> 01:38:30.167
who asked to turn state's evidence
while he was still on the ground.

01:38:36.626 --> 01:38:38.917
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck are you doing?

01:38:39.334 --> 01:38:40.251
Fucking with us?

01:38:41.876 --> 01:38:43.959
- What time is it?
- 5:00 o'clock.

01:38:44.751 --> 01:38:47.501
Time's flying and court's
waiting, Marcin.

01:38:48.001 --> 01:38:49.042
All right, I'll turn
state's evidence.

01:38:51.126 --> 01:38:52.126
Don't bullshit us, ok?

01:38:52.334 --> 01:38:54.959
I'll tell you everything just take me
the fuck down and give me something to eat.

01:38:55.292 --> 01:38:57.084
You have to sing for your supper.

01:38:58.084 --> 01:39:01.084
- This ain't no game.
- I take insulin and growth hormone.

01:39:01.876 --> 01:39:04.001
If I don't eat something soon,

01:39:04.792 --> 01:39:07.251
I'll go into a coma and
we won't talk at all.

01:39:07.542 --> 01:39:08.334
Fuck!

01:39:09.001 --> 01:39:10.417
Take him down.

01:39:11.584 --> 01:39:13.126
Want a sandwich?

01:39:13.959 --> 01:39:17.292
Where are the seven people
with their fingers cut off?

01:39:50.417 --> 01:39:52.626
So that's what I was snagging
my hook on.

01:40:19.834 --> 01:40:21.834
You're not a gangster!

01:40:22.417 --> 01:40:25.251
You're a pussy and a sucker.

01:40:25.959 --> 01:40:27.917
You're not a gangster!

01:40:28.376 --> 01:40:31.251
You're a pussy and a sucker.

01:40:32.542 --> 01:40:34.542
You're not a gangster!

01:40:35.042 --> 01:40:37.542
You're a pussy and a sucker.

01:40:42.501 --> 01:40:43.667
Get up, your ride's here.

01:40:50.042 --> 01:40:50.876
Fear, you know that

01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:55.501
with a conviction for murder
you can't turn state's evidence?

01:40:58.209 --> 01:40:58.917
Oh yeah.

01:41:01.042 --> 01:41:03.876
Then why the fuck did
you give statements

01:41:04.459 --> 01:41:07.917
that fucked your father and brother
for some old shit they did?

01:41:08.334 --> 01:41:11.042
For me things are black or white.
If I redeem myself, it's total.

01:41:11.959 --> 01:41:14.001
They killed your
mother in revenge.

01:41:14.001 --> 01:41:17.376
You won't have anyone to visit
you on Christmas in prison.

01:41:17.959 --> 01:41:22.084
But thanks to that, the prosecutor promised
me only 15 years for killing the Chechen.

01:41:22.584 --> 01:41:23.376
Marcin.

01:41:26.626 --> 01:41:29.917
Don't be so gullible. After all

01:41:30.251 --> 01:41:32.834
for burying those seven corpses
with missing fingers

01:41:33.459 --> 01:41:35.251
you'll get three life sentences.

01:41:35.917 --> 01:41:38.917
I understand, but for the Chechen
the prosecutor promised me only 15.

01:41:45.001 --> 01:41:48.292
I've heard you're a cop
who can't be bought.

01:41:48.626 --> 01:41:50.667
I don't like bandits either.

01:41:52.167 --> 01:41:55.251
I run a small store and they
said I have to pay protection.

01:41:55.542 --> 01:41:58.334
Is there room to hide a couple
of guys for an ambush?

01:41:58.959 --> 01:42:02.376
No, but next door were gambling
machines, now it's empty.

01:42:04.792 --> 01:42:08.042
Sir, I've got a few thousand
victims I must keep in touch with.

01:42:08.376 --> 01:42:11.167
I requested two phones, one for
the investigative officer and one for me.

01:42:11.334 --> 01:42:12.667
The investigator got one
and I didn't.

01:42:13.001 --> 01:42:15.917
Holy smoke, there wasn't
a phone for you.

01:42:16.459 --> 01:42:17.626
There was only one.

01:42:18.292 --> 01:42:19.959
One's enough for you.

01:42:21.001 --> 01:42:22.667
That's life.

01:42:27.209 --> 01:42:30.042
Go to the "Blue"
detective agency,

01:42:30.417 --> 01:42:32.584
on Niepodleglosci Ave.

01:42:39.292 --> 01:42:40.501
Hi, sit down.

01:42:42.584 --> 01:42:43.501
Something to drink?

01:42:43.959 --> 01:42:45.584
Too early for vodka, huh?

01:42:45.959 --> 01:42:47.709
Coffee, black, right?

01:42:52.292 --> 01:42:53.001
Here.

01:42:54.417 --> 01:42:57.417
Our security agency decided
to sponsor a phone for you.

01:42:58.167 --> 01:43:00.292
We know what you're working on.

01:43:00.542 --> 01:43:03.167
We're all cops here.

01:43:04.917 --> 01:43:09.334
Don't get so teared up. They'll write it off,
and won't give a shit about you.

01:43:10.917 --> 01:43:12.917
Unless you start calling abroad.

01:43:13.751 --> 01:43:14.834
How's the Mokotow gang?

01:43:15.376 --> 01:43:15.959
Nailed a couple.

01:43:16.292 --> 01:43:19.209
They've done so much it would
take years to do the full boat.

01:43:19.459 --> 01:43:21.001
So I'm breaking it down
into smaller cases.

01:43:21.667 --> 01:43:25.126
I jail them for small shit, then find other
crimes and get their sentences extended.

01:43:26.709 --> 01:43:27.959
Clever boy.

01:43:29.042 --> 01:43:33.126
If you ever want to work here
instead of downtown,

01:43:33.792 --> 01:43:34.584
then call.

01:43:59.542 --> 01:44:04.542
There's no toilet, so no craps,
and we piss in the sink.

01:44:04.834 --> 01:44:07.959
I put it high, so it might look
like you're fucking the wall.

01:44:08.459 --> 01:44:12.542
Some smoke, some don't, so
we don't overdo it, ok?

01:44:13.876 --> 01:44:15.876
That Lech fan we fucked up

01:44:16.209 --> 01:44:18.167
with the baseball bat is here.

01:44:18.584 --> 01:44:20.459
- So, he survived.
- He's got something for you.

01:44:28.584 --> 01:44:30.792
The guy who clubbed your son.

01:44:38.209 --> 01:44:39.917
Thanks.

01:44:47.834 --> 01:44:50.751
- I feel sick.
- Can you hold out?

01:44:51.334 --> 01:44:52.001
No.

01:44:55.751 --> 01:44:57.209
Someone just went in.

01:45:01.459 --> 01:45:03.584
Fucking wait.

01:45:05.334 --> 01:45:07.542
Hi, brother-in-law.

01:45:12.042 --> 01:45:14.292
Oh fuck, I can't believe it.

01:45:14.834 --> 01:45:16.876
When'd you move out?

01:45:17.251 --> 01:45:18.542
Long time ago.

01:45:19.334 --> 01:45:23.501
A guy who murdered, cut off fingers, comes
to some rathole of a store to extort money?.

01:45:24.209 --> 01:45:27.584
People tell me you've got
a problem with gangsters.

01:45:27.917 --> 01:45:29.792
I figured I could help you.

01:45:31.209 --> 01:45:34.292
- I could use it.
- All right, I'll talk to them.

01:45:35.084 --> 01:45:36.126
We'll be in touch.

01:45:36.959 --> 01:45:37.917
- Let's go.
- No.

01:45:38.167 --> 01:45:39.292
He'll get away.

01:45:39.876 --> 01:45:41.251
Taking him now is easy.

01:45:41.917 --> 01:45:43.376
The trick is to catch
him red-handed.

01:45:44.334 --> 01:45:46.001
Give Ewka my best.

01:45:57.167 --> 01:45:58.584
No free lunch.

01:45:59.334 --> 01:46:01.542
You have to give something.
How much cash do you have?

01:46:02.584 --> 01:46:05.709
- A thousand
- Let's have it.

01:46:13.209 --> 01:46:15.251
On the ground, Granny.

01:46:18.626 --> 01:46:19.667
Cuff him.

01:46:21.001 --> 01:46:23.126
Eyes on me.

01:46:24.251 --> 01:46:27.251
- What are you trying to do?
- I knew it was you.

01:46:27.834 --> 01:46:31.126
Then why the fuck did you come
instead of sending some flunky?

01:46:31.459 --> 01:46:32.959
But you're happy it's me,
aren't you?

01:46:59.042 --> 01:47:02.209
Nobody fucking touches him.
Want to bad mouth him? Go ahead.

01:47:02.376 --> 01:47:03.959
Anyone touches him
will be fucking sorry.

01:47:05.626 --> 01:47:07.251
Because I say so.

01:47:07.751 --> 01:47:10.126
He sees me drifting with
a woman and kids, jumps

01:47:10.126 --> 01:47:12.376
into the fucking lake
and hauls in my boat...

01:47:12.626 --> 01:47:14.542
He at least deserves not
to be fucked over by you guys.

01:47:15.709 --> 01:47:17.167
Prosecutor.

01:47:24.959 --> 01:47:27.292
All right, it's fucking 5:00 o'clock.

01:47:27.834 --> 01:47:29.542
You want to charge me with
fucking extortion?

01:47:30.042 --> 01:47:31.876
You've got it all on tape, so
let's make things easier.

01:47:32.751 --> 01:47:35.917
I'll admit to the extortion
charge and get three years.

01:47:36.501 --> 01:47:39.751
In exchange you let me get
married while I'm in prison.

01:47:45.334 --> 01:47:46.959
Soup's in jail. Granny's in jail.

01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:48.584
Who's going to collect the money?

01:47:48.834 --> 01:47:50.376
- I don't know.
- Maybe you could?

01:47:50.584 --> 01:47:51.042
Me?

01:47:52.834 --> 01:47:55.667
I put mine aside every month.
If you talk to Soup,

01:47:56.042 --> 01:47:59.001
tell him his money's
waiting for him.

01:48:03.542 --> 01:48:04.751
What happened to you?

01:48:06.501 --> 01:48:08.084
What happened to me?

01:48:13.959 --> 01:48:17.709
Your brother's buddies did this.

01:48:18.459 --> 01:48:20.542
For blowing money
that wasn't mine.

01:48:21.584 --> 01:48:25.084
A kid in the hood owes me money.
I'd like to kill him.

01:48:32.917 --> 01:48:34.334
Yeah?

01:48:42.626 --> 01:48:44.334
You fucking snitch.

01:48:46.376 --> 01:48:49.209
You fingered us.

01:48:51.126 --> 01:48:57.001
You told them where Soup lived.
The gang wants to make you pay.

01:48:57.917 --> 01:49:00.292
Make you pay, understand?

01:49:00.626 --> 01:49:03.167
I didn't sell anyone out.

01:49:04.042 --> 01:49:07.376
A police informer is coming here.

01:49:08.417 --> 01:49:14.001
He'll say if it was you or not.

01:49:14.709 --> 01:49:16.042
Let him come and look.

01:49:17.084 --> 01:49:18.917
Moron.

01:49:20.834 --> 01:49:24.126
You think he's going to
want to talk to you?

01:49:24.959 --> 01:49:27.292
Face to face?

01:49:28.459 --> 01:49:31.709
We have to tie you to a chair
and put on a blindfold.

01:49:32.001 --> 01:49:34.459
So the source thinks we're
taking care of business here.

01:49:35.167 --> 01:49:38.167
Tie me up then.

01:49:47.501 --> 01:49:49.251
It's gone too far.

01:49:51.751 --> 01:49:55.792
He'll turn us in to the cops,
and we'll do time

01:50:00.792 --> 01:50:03.917
for kidnapping or some such shit.

01:50:06.876 --> 01:50:09.001
We have to finish him off.

01:50:22.667 --> 01:50:24.417
Shhh.

01:50:26.626 --> 01:50:28.501
Pull.

01:50:31.792 --> 01:50:34.542
- Like this?
- Yeah.

01:50:38.126 --> 01:50:40.376
He said he fucks you in the ass.

01:50:42.084 --> 01:50:46.667
He said he'll never
give you back the money.

01:50:49.334 --> 01:50:52.209
He says you're a fag.

01:50:53.042 --> 01:50:55.834
The biggest sucker in the hood.

01:51:07.209 --> 01:51:08.626
Harder.

01:51:11.667 --> 01:51:13.751
You have to pull harder.

01:51:17.876 --> 01:51:19.584
Harder.

01:51:37.167 --> 01:51:39.792
The groom may kiss the bride.

01:52:48.042 --> 01:52:49.834
You married Granny?

01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:57.792
Yes.

01:52:58.542 --> 01:53:01.501
I picked up Tomasz's car
this morning.

01:53:02.376 --> 01:53:03.876
I'm here for the registration.

01:53:05.126 --> 01:53:06.792
Do you know what he did?

01:53:08.167 --> 01:53:09.917
People change.

01:53:10.876 --> 01:53:12.292
I'm talking about Salman.

01:53:20.209 --> 01:53:22.459
Then ask your husband what
he did to your first husband.

01:53:30.167 --> 01:53:31.292
I've got your papers.

01:53:46.834 --> 01:53:50.001
- Want a ride home.
- Yeah, right.

01:53:52.376 --> 01:53:53.626
Fuck, now what?

01:53:57.959 --> 01:54:00.084
Sir, is this the new operational car?

01:54:00.167 --> 01:54:02.501
Holy smoke, beautiful, isn't it?

01:54:03.334 --> 01:54:04.626
For operational work.

01:54:04.876 --> 01:54:09.084
You do realize, sir, that if you drive around
in your uniform this car is useless?

01:54:09.417 --> 01:54:11.084
All the criminals will know
it's a cop car.

01:54:12.001 --> 01:54:13.417
Thank you, goodbye.

01:54:20.792 --> 01:54:24.417
You fucking prick. Fuck you.

01:55:28.667 --> 01:55:30.084
Roll down the window.

01:55:59.834 --> 01:56:02.334
- What is it?
- Go...

01:56:02.834 --> 01:56:05.084
and look at the camera
in front of Tomasz's prison.

01:56:07.792 --> 01:56:09.334
And give him my love.

01:56:15.084 --> 01:56:16.084
Hold these.

01:56:18.501 --> 01:56:21.084
You're not going to fucking
leave me with these, are you?

01:56:26.042 --> 01:56:28.834
He leaves with other prisoners
to work on the outside somewhere.

01:56:29.001 --> 01:56:30.626
- How long?
- Nine days.

01:56:37.667 --> 01:56:39.376
Does he pay you for it?

01:56:40.959 --> 01:56:44.584
Yeah, but nothing's going on.
He always returns for the night.

01:56:45.126 --> 01:56:46.126
Fuck.

01:56:48.584 --> 01:56:51.251
Granny's car, which his wife picked up.
Check the cameras

01:56:51.251 --> 01:56:53.959
around the prison and see which
door he exited at 08:15.

01:57:05.667 --> 01:57:06.834
Kiss me.

01:57:26.376 --> 01:57:27.834
Stay in the car.

01:58:06.167 --> 01:58:07.709
He's not there.

01:58:22.167 --> 01:58:23.876
Oh fuck me...

01:58:45.376 --> 01:58:46.751
Game over.

01:58:47.501 --> 01:58:49.292
You don't have nine
lives either.

01:58:50.167 --> 01:58:52.376
You think I can't kill a cop?

01:58:53.126 --> 01:58:55.084
That I'm finished if I do that?

01:58:56.459 --> 01:58:58.501
One thing.
Did you kill that kid?

01:59:00.834 --> 01:59:05.417
Fuck off and start worrying
about your own kids.

01:59:13.001 --> 01:59:14.876
We're not all that different.

01:59:16.042 --> 01:59:18.667
Yes we are. For me to kill you,
you have to reach for your gun.

01:59:39.876 --> 01:59:41.126
I told you to wait.

01:59:41.459 --> 01:59:45.292
I didn't know what happened.
I heard shots and I thought...

02:00:04.334 --> 02:00:07.792
Central Police Headquarters
Internal Affairs Division

02:00:09.084 --> 02:00:10.459
Hello, my friend.

02:00:12.167 --> 02:00:12.959
Sit down.

02:00:15.292 --> 02:00:17.292
Someone called saying it was
some sort of formality.

02:00:17.959 --> 02:00:19.167
I'm to sign something, so

02:00:19.751 --> 02:00:22.376
-give it to me, and I'll go.
- Got your badge?

02:00:22.584 --> 02:00:24.084
- Yeah.
- Let me have it.

02:00:31.167 --> 02:00:32.001
We've got you.

02:00:33.792 --> 02:00:34.959
What the fuck?

02:00:36.001 --> 02:00:38.334
You say you're my friend,
and you act like this?

02:00:39.042 --> 02:00:40.959
Who the fuck are you?
Give me that badge.

02:00:41.834 --> 02:00:44.001
- No.
- Give it to me or I'll beat the fuck...

02:00:44.334 --> 02:00:46.084
- There are two of us.
- Think I won't

02:00:46.084 --> 02:00:47.792
wipe the floor with both of you?

02:00:50.376 --> 02:00:51.709
Give me back the badge now.

02:00:58.876 --> 02:01:00.542
Here, you fucking has-been.

02:01:01.376 --> 02:01:03.417
You think I'm a schmuck
who's going to cry.

02:01:03.917 --> 02:01:05.584
That I'll run away with my badge?

02:01:06.251 --> 02:01:08.626
- Fuck off friend.
- Listen.

02:01:09.126 --> 02:01:11.376
You're suspected of violating discipline.

02:01:11.709 --> 02:01:13.292
You're going to be suspended.

02:01:13.709 --> 02:01:16.459
Better if you resign on your own.

02:01:16.834 --> 02:01:18.626
Then we'll drop the case.

02:01:19.001 --> 02:01:20.042
When you quit

02:01:21.001 --> 02:01:22.667
the police chief will get off your back.

02:01:23.084 --> 02:01:25.417
If not, we'll have to file charges.

02:01:25.667 --> 02:01:26.667
What charges?

02:01:27.292 --> 02:01:29.792
That you cruise around town
in a new operational car

02:01:30.084 --> 02:01:32.626
in your uniform, and
pick up young snatch.

02:01:39.542 --> 02:01:44.501
So it doesn't matter if
I'm guilty. Just so I quit, huh?

02:01:44.876 --> 02:01:47.584
Then tell your boss that
we're going to fight.

02:01:47.917 --> 02:01:50.501
He didn't put me on the force, and
he isn't going to move me out.

02:01:55.667 --> 02:01:57.834
- Police.
- What's this all about?

02:01:58.792 --> 02:02:00.126
What's going on here?

02:02:02.334 --> 02:02:04.917
Gebels, he's not here.

02:02:33.792 --> 02:02:35.084
Recognize me, boy?

02:02:38.626 --> 02:02:40.834
Why'd you fucking kill him, huh?

02:02:41.334 --> 02:02:42.834
Don't swear in front of me.

02:02:51.501 --> 02:02:53.876
Do you understand your situation now?

02:02:54.209 --> 02:02:55.876
Or shall I explain more?

02:03:01.209 --> 02:03:02.417
Why the fuck are you
looking at me like that?

02:03:04.209 --> 02:03:05.251
Want to hit me back?

02:03:09.917 --> 02:03:10.834
Go ahead and try.

02:03:15.876 --> 02:03:16.709
Well?

02:03:17.959 --> 02:03:21.751
Still mad at me or
think you deserved it?

02:03:24.209 --> 02:03:26.376
I guess I deserved it.

02:03:28.834 --> 02:03:30.417
Back to your cell, boy.

02:03:32.167 --> 02:03:35.126
If my father had whipped
the fuck out of me...

02:03:35.292 --> 02:03:37.042
Don't talk dirty, don't swear.

02:03:37.417 --> 02:03:39.417
...then I wouldn't be here today.

02:03:43.084 --> 02:03:46.709
Go ahead and kill me.
I don't deserve to live.

02:03:48.709 --> 02:03:49.626
No, boy.

02:03:50.876 --> 02:03:52.792
We aren't going to kill you.

02:03:53.792 --> 02:03:57.251
Even if you want to kill yourself.

02:03:58.126 --> 02:04:00.126
We won't let you die.

02:04:01.584 --> 02:04:03.251
So you'll always remember.

02:04:04.376 --> 02:04:07.501
And so you know why
you're in prison.

02:04:11.459 --> 02:04:12.959
Do you know what you did?

02:04:20.667 --> 02:04:21.834
Nothing.

02:04:25.376 --> 02:04:28.459
Then now you'll fucking see
how pleasant it was for him.

02:05:17.667 --> 02:05:18.959
Fuck!

02:05:24.376 --> 02:05:26.376
No! No!.

02:05:41.792 --> 02:05:42.667
Now do you know?

02:06:25.376 --> 02:06:30.001
If I suck the guard's dick,
will I have it easier?

02:06:33.376 --> 02:06:40.417
Know how old he is? You want
to suck an old geezer's dick?

02:06:41.334 --> 02:06:43.709
If it makes things easier for me.

02:07:19.542 --> 02:07:21.751
Charges against you
weren't confirmed.

02:07:21.959 --> 02:07:24.417
But the police chief ordered
you removed from the unit.

02:07:24.751 --> 02:07:27.626
You've been demoted to
recovering property in Ursus.

02:07:27.792 --> 02:07:29.459
District Police Station
Ursus District

02:07:33.334 --> 02:07:39.084
Report of stolen jars from a
basement at 7 Pieciolinia Str.

02:07:48.542 --> 02:07:52.126
Hi Ola. Don't wait supper.
I'm going on a call. Bye

02:07:52.626 --> 02:07:53.251
And?

02:07:53.584 --> 02:07:55.167
What the fuck do you mean, bye?
Supper's burning.

02:07:55.167 --> 02:07:56.667
Come home soon.
