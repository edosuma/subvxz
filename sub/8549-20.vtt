00:03.904 --> 00:05.473
UHH! SCREWDRIVER.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.775
SCREWDRIVER.

00:15.983 --> 00:18.018
PLIERS.
PLIERS.

00:29.063 --> 00:30.098
LOLLIPOP.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.499
LOLLIPOP.

00:37.405 --> 00:39.540
OKAY, RICHIE,
WE'RE FINISHED.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.775
NOW LET'S SEE
HOW OUR PATIENT IS DOING.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.152
[COUGHING]

00:54.021 --> 00:56.390
IT'S A GONER,
UNCLE CARL.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.971
* IT'S A RARE CONDITION *

01:11.038 --> 01:12.440
* IN THIS DAY AND AGE *

01:12.506 --> 01:15.743
* TO READ ANY GOOD NEWS
ON THE NEWSPAPER PAGE *

01:15.809 --> 01:19.380
* AND LOVE AND TRADITION
OF THE GRAND DESIGN *

01:19.447 --> 01:23.751
* SOME PEOPLE SAY
IS EVEN HARDER TO FIND *

01:23.817 --> 01:27.087
* WELL, THEN, THERE MUST BE
SOME MAGIC CLUE *

01:27.155 --> 01:31.292
* INSIDE THESE GENTLE WALLS *

01:31.359 --> 01:34.728
* 'CAUSE ALL I SEE
IS A TOWER OF DREAMS *

01:34.795 --> 01:39.233
* REAL LOVE BURSTIN'
OUT OF EVERY SEAM *

01:40.033 --> 01:42.703
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:42.770 --> 01:46.907
* WE'RE GONNA FILL OUR HOUSE
WITH HAPPINESS *

01:46.974 --> 01:49.543
* THE MOON MAY CRY *

01:49.610 --> 01:53.481
* WE'RE GONNA SMOTHER THE BLUES
WITH TENDERNESS *

01:53.547 --> 01:56.684
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:56.750 --> 02:00.288

ROOM FOR ME *

02:00.354 --> 02:04.358

AN OPPORTUNITY *

* AS DAYS GO BY *

02:07.661 --> 02:12.400
* IT'S THE BIGGER LOVE
OF THE FAMILY *

02:23.977 --> 02:26.347
YOU'VE HAD YOUR HEAD
IN THOSE BOOKS ALL MORNING.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.349
YOU GOT A BIG TEST
COMING UP?

02:28.416 --> 02:30.117
NO, THIS IS
BLACK HISTORY MONTH.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.619
DID YOU KNOW
AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN

02:31.685 --> 02:34.054
HELPED DESIGN THE BLUEPRINT
FOR WASHINGTON, D.C.?

02:34.121 --> 02:36.190
YUP. BENJAMIN BANNEKER.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.591
HEY, NOT BAD.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.428
HEY, YOUR OLD MAN
HAS READ A BOOK OR TWO.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.733
NOW FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP
AND THE TOASTER OVEN,

02:45.799 --> 02:48.101
WHO MADE THE FIRST PATENTED
SHOE-SEWING MACHINE?

02:48.168 --> 02:49.537
UH...UH...

02:49.603 --> 02:50.738
BUZZ!

02:50.804 --> 02:52.039
GRANDMA.

02:52.105 --> 02:55.876
IT WAS JAN MASLINGER
IN 1883.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.745
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

02:57.811 --> 03:00.581
WHO DO YOU THINK BOUGHT
HIS FIRST PAIR OF SHOES?

03:03.584 --> 03:06.520
HEY, LOOK. HERE'S
SOMETHING I DIDN'T KNOW.

03:06.587 --> 03:09.323
ALEXANDRE DUMAS
WAS BLACK.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.158
THE GUY THAT WROTE
THE THREE MUSKETEERS?

03:11.225 --> 03:13.694
YEAH.
MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT.

03:13.761 --> 03:16.196
WHY? DON'T THEY TEACH
BLACK HISTORY AT YOUR SCHOOL?

03:16.264 --> 03:17.831
YEAH, BUT ONLY FOR ONE MONTH.

03:17.898 --> 03:21.101
THAT'S ONE MONTH LONGER
THAN THEY TAUGHT IT TO ME.

03:21.168 --> 03:22.770
YOU KNOW,
THAT REALLY BUGS ME.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.538
I MEAN, WE'VE MADE
IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS

03:24.605 --> 03:27.007
TO THIS COUNTRY
FOR OVER 300 YEARS.

03:27.074 --> 03:30.544
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT LOOKING
AT HISTORY BOOKS, IT'S NOT FAIR.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.480
WELL, SWEETHEART,
IF YOU FEEL THAT STRONGLY,

03:32.546 --> 03:35.316
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

03:35.383 --> 03:36.917
MAYBE I WILL.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.589
UH, OKAY.

03:41.655 --> 03:44.725
NOW LET'S GIVE
THIS BABY ANOTHER SHOT.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.932
HA HA HA!

03:55.903 --> 03:57.137
[COUGHING]

03:57.204 --> 03:59.907
WAY TO GO,
MR. FIX-IT.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.653
UGH! WHAT IS THIS?

04:13.487 --> 04:15.623
IF YOU HAVE TO ASK, PASS.

04:41.148 --> 04:43.684
OH, HI,
MY LITTLE JELL-O MOLD.

04:49.523 --> 04:52.125
OH, SO, MS. STEUBEN,
WHAT LOOKS GOOD?

04:52.192 --> 04:53.527
SUMMER.

04:54.695 --> 04:57.798
OH, MS. STEUBEN,
YOU'RE A JOKE A YEAR.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.811
AHH, PRINCIPAL
SHIMATA-SAN.

05:12.846 --> 05:13.981
URKEL.

05:36.504 --> 05:39.172
STEVE,
I'M SAVING THIS SEAT.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.375
OH. WHY, HOW THOUGHTFUL.

05:44.778 --> 05:47.981
* OH, IT'S LUNCHTIME
IN THE SCHOOL CAFE *

05:48.048 --> 05:49.383
* DOO-DAH DOO-DAH *

05:49.450 --> 05:51.184
* GONNA SET MY PLACE
AND FEED MY FACE *

05:51.251 --> 05:54.021
* ALL THE DOO-DAH DAY
GONNA SET MY PLACE *

05:54.087 --> 05:55.088
STEVE.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.089
* THEN I'LL
FEED MY FACE *

05:56.156 --> 05:57.491
STEVE!

06:00.828 --> 06:01.795
STEVEN...

06:01.862 --> 06:04.798
DO WE HAVE TO GO
THROUGH THIS EVERY DAY?

06:04.865 --> 06:06.834
WELL, MS. MS. STEUBEN,
IT'S A WELL-KNOWN FACT

06:06.900 --> 06:09.703
THAT A PLEASANT DINING
ENVIRONMENT AIDS DIGESTION.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.972
TRY IT. IT MAY BRIGHTEN
YOUR COMPLEXION.

06:12.039 --> 06:15.042
WHICH TRUTH BE TOLD,
IS A SMIDGE ON THE SALLOW SIDE.

06:26.286 --> 06:30.390
UM, LISTEN, EVERYBODY. I HAVE AN
IDEA THAT I WANT TO RUN BY YOU.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.593
THIS THE IDEA
I HEARD YOU TELLING MAXINE

06:32.660 --> 06:35.028
AS I TRAILED BEHIND
AT THE MUTUALLY AGREED UPON

06:35.095 --> 06:37.030
DISTANCE OF 20 FEET?

06:39.366 --> 06:41.635
YEAH. UH, NOW
WHAT I'D LIKE--

06:41.702 --> 06:47.140
IT'S A HUMDINGER OF AN IDEA,
BUT TELL IT, MY LITTLE CROUTON.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.142
THANK YOU.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.778
NOW, AS I WAS TRYING TO SAY

06:50.844 --> 06:52.513
EVERY FEBRUARY
WE STUDY BLACK HISTORY,

06:52.580 --> 06:54.147
BUT ONLY DURING
THAT MONTH, SO--

06:54.214 --> 06:56.484
OH, OH, OH,
I LOVE THIS PART.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.456
I'M NOT TRYING
TO CRITICIZE YOU, MS. STEUBEN.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.857
YOU'RE A GREAT
HISTORY TEACHER.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.494
WELL, THANK YOU, LAURA.
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS TRY TO--

07:06.560 --> 07:07.861
MS. STEUBEN, PLEASE.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.998
DON'T INTERRUPT.
IT'S VERY RUDE.

07:22.342 --> 07:23.977
SO, ANYWAY
I THOUGHT WHY NOT

07:24.044 --> 07:26.013
ADD A BLACK HISTORY CLASS
TO THE CURRICULUM,

07:26.079 --> 07:28.381
THAT WAY WE COULD
STUDY IT ALL YEAR.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.083
ISN'T THAT
A GREAT IDEA?

07:30.150 --> 07:33.987
OH, IT'S A PEARL OF WISDOM
FROM MY LITTLE OYSTER.

07:36.023 --> 07:36.990
CLAM UP.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.427
SO, I THOUGHT IF EVERYONE
SIGNED THESE PETITIONS,

07:40.494 --> 07:42.796
WE'D HAVE A BETTER CHANCE
OF GETTING A CLASS.

07:42.863 --> 07:46.900
THIS IS TERRIFIC, LAURA.
LET ME BE THE FIRST TO SIGN.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.338
WELL, I'LL BE
THE SECOND TO SIGN

07:51.404 --> 07:53.807
AS SOON AS MISS
GRABBY PEN FINISHES.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.185
THANKS FOR SIGNING.

08:05.252 --> 08:06.620
HOLD IT. HOLD IT. HOLD IT.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.122
THAT'S MY PEN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.728
HEY! HI, GUYS. GOT A SEC?

08:14.795 --> 08:18.899
URKEL, GO AWAY. WE DON'T
WANNA HAVE TO DUNK YOU, AGAIN.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.535
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T
BANK ME IN, IT'S FINE.

08:21.602 --> 08:24.204
HEY, LET ME
SHOW YOU A FEW MOVES.

08:24.271 --> 08:28.008
OOH, DON'T MESS WITH ME.
DON'T MESS WITH ME.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.209
OH, OH.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.778
HEY, CHECK IT
OUT, MAN.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.947
HEH HEH HEH!

08:37.585 --> 08:39.653
OKAY, GUYS,
SHOW TIME'S OVER.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.689
I HAVE VITAL INFORMATION
TO SHARE WITH YOU.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.423
URKEL, I'VE SAID
A THOUSAND TIMES.

08:43.490 --> 08:46.660
I REFUSE TO
TAKE POLKA LESSONS.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.296
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, GUYS,
THIS EVEN TOPS POLKA.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.332
WE'RE TRYING TO GET A BLACK
HISTORY CLASS HERE AT SCHOOL.

08:52.399 --> 08:53.801
IT'LL HELP US
APPRECIATE THE PAST,

08:53.867 --> 08:55.502
THEREBY CONTRIBUTING
TO THE PRESENT

08:55.569 --> 08:57.004
AND PREPARING US
FOR THE FUTURE.

08:57.070 --> 09:00.207
SO, I'D LIKE YOUR
JOHN HANCOCK'S RIGHT HERE.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.643
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.713
OH, THANKS A LOT,
GUYS. WELL, THAT WAS EASY.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.180
IT'S RIGHT THERE.
OKEY-DOKE.

09:07.247 --> 09:08.448
THANKS.

09:08.515 --> 09:10.550
GOOD TOOTS, DUDES.
THANKS.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.519
STEVE.
HEY, LAURA.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.154
LOOK AT ALL
THE SIGNATURES I GOT.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.189
OOH, GOOD WORK.
I GOT A BUNCH, TOO.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.491
WELL, I GOT MOST OF
THE BASKETBALL TEAM.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.493
IT'S ON TO THE SWIM TEAM NEXT.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.164
I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW OFF
MY BACKSTROKE.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.432
OH!

09:25.498 --> 09:26.466
OH! OH!

09:26.533 --> 09:27.500
AAH!

09:27.567 --> 09:28.902
AAH!

09:34.708 --> 09:36.910
DID I DO THAT?

09:40.681 --> 09:42.816
UH, STEVE...

09:42.883 --> 09:44.618
NO MORE
DEMONSTRATIONS, OKAY.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.286
GOOD IDEA.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.155
BUT I APPRECIATE
ALL YOUR HELP.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.758
OH, WELL, ANYTIME,
MY CUTE LITTLE CRUSADER.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.393
I BELIEVE IN YOU
AND I BELIEVE IN YOUR CAUSE.

09:53.460 --> 09:56.163
WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT, STEVE.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.266
HEY, MY LOCKER'S OPEN.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.238
OH, MY GOD.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.974
LAURA, WHAT'S WRONG?

10:08.408 --> 10:11.879
"IF YOU WANT BLACK HISTORY,
GO BACK TO AFRICA."

10:14.581 --> 10:15.916
WHAT?

10:48.548 --> 10:49.950
WELL,
HOW'S SHE DOING?

10:50.017 --> 10:51.985
SHE'S STILL PRETTY UPSET.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.887
SHE DIDN'T
TOUCH HER DINNER.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.889
WELL, HARRIETTE,
WHAT ARE THOSE PEOPLE TEACHING

10:55.956 --> 10:57.057
DOWN AT THAT SCHOOL?

10:57.124 --> 10:58.692
THEIR VERSION
OF THE THREE Rs--

10:58.759 --> 11:01.094
READING, WRITING,
AND RACISM?

11:01.161 --> 11:03.731
CARL, CALM DOWN.
IT'S NOT THE SCHOOL'S FAULT.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.999
WELL, IS SHE STILL CRYING?

11:06.066 --> 11:08.435
EVERY TIME SHE STOPS,
SHE STARTS AGAIN.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.638
DAMN IT!

11:11.705 --> 11:13.006
CARL.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.474
HARRIETTE, I JUST
FEEL SO HELPLESS.

11:14.541 --> 11:17.745
MY DAUGHTER'S BEEN HURT,
AND I CAN'T DO A THING ABOUT IT.

11:17.811 --> 11:20.080
I CAN'T TELL HER
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.915
I KNOW.

11:21.982 --> 11:25.685
YOU KNOW, I WAS EXPOSED
TO THIS SORT OF THING

11:25.753 --> 11:27.254
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.257
BUT I ALWAYS HOPED IT WOULD BE
DIFFERENT FOR MY KIDS.

11:30.323 --> 11:33.894
COME ON, HARRIETTE.
THE PEOPLE THAT DID THIS TO US

11:33.961 --> 11:36.797
ARE TEACHING THAT SAME
GARBAGE TO THEIR KIDS.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.333
CARL...

11:40.400 --> 11:43.703
I'M UP IN LAURA'S ROOM
AND SHE LOOKS AT ME...

11:45.005 --> 11:47.741
AND SHE ASKS,
"WHY, MOM?"

11:47.808 --> 11:50.744
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY
DO THIS TO ME?"

11:50.811 --> 11:52.512
AND I HEAR MYSELF
TELLING HER

11:52.579 --> 11:55.348
THE SAME THINGS
MY MOTHER TOLD ME.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.117
"SOME PEOPLE
ARE IGNORANT.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.718
"THEY'RE AFRAID.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.087
"THEY HATE ANYBODY

12:00.153 --> 12:03.390
AND ANYTHING
THAT'S DIFFERENT."

12:03.456 --> 12:05.893
AND WHAT'D SHE SAY?

12:05.959 --> 12:09.729
SHE LOOKED AT ME
WITH TEARS IN HER EYES

12:09.797 --> 12:12.800
AND SHE SAID,
"BUT WHY, MOM?"

12:29.682 --> 12:31.551
LAURA?

12:31.618 --> 12:32.752
WHAT HAPPENED?

12:32.820 --> 12:35.155
DADDY, EVERYTHING'S A MESS.

12:35.222 --> 12:37.124
LAURA, DID SOMEBODY
DO SOMETHING TO YOU?

12:37.190 --> 12:40.260
NO, IT'S THE WHOLE SCHOOL. BLACK
KIDS WON'T TALK TO WHITE KIDS.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.095
PEOPLE CALLING
EACH OTHER NAMES,

12:42.162 --> 12:45.532
TAKING SIDES.
AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.234
YOUR FAULT?

12:47.300 --> 12:50.437
IF I DIDN'T START THAT PETITION
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

12:50.503 --> 12:53.506
I WANTED TO MAKE THINGS BETTER,
I ENDED UP MAKING THEM WORSE.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.943
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
NONE OF THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.478
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT PETITION WAS A GREAT IDEA.

12:58.545 --> 13:01.114
NO, IT WASN'T.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.316
I WISH I HAD
NEVER DONE IT.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.488
I WISH IT WOULD
ALL GO AWAY, DADDY.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.925
WOULD YOU TWO
EXCUSE US?

13:11.992 --> 13:14.361
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO
MY GRANDDAUGHTER ALONE.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.462
WE GOT--
BUT, MOM--

13:15.528 --> 13:17.797
SCOOT, HONEY.
SCOOT.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.938
LAURA...

13:25.005 --> 13:28.575
DO YOU MIND IF
YOUR OLD GRANDMOTHER

13:28.641 --> 13:29.910
TELLS YOU A STORY?

13:29.977 --> 13:31.578
GRANDMA, YOU'RE NOT OLD.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.980
GOOD ANSWER.

13:35.482 --> 13:39.052
NO WONDER YOU'RE
MY FAVORITE GRANDCHILD.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.925
SIT DOWN, HONEY.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.928
LAURA, WHEN I WAS
ABOUT YOUR AGE,

13:47.995 --> 13:49.930
I LOVED TO READ.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.399
JUST LIKE YOU.

13:52.465 --> 13:56.503
BUT OUR LITTLE TOWN
ONLY HAD ONE LIBRARY,

13:56.569 --> 13:59.039
AND IT WAS
FOR WHITES ONLY.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.874
YOU COULDN'T
CHECK OUT A BOOK?

14:00.941 --> 14:03.843
I COULDN'T
EVEN GO IN.

14:03.911 --> 14:07.180
AND EVEN THEN,
I KNEW IT WASN'T RIGHT.

14:07.247 --> 14:11.151
SO ONE DAY, I DECIDED TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

14:11.218 --> 14:14.654
SO I WALKED
IN THE LIBRARY.

14:14.721 --> 14:18.125
SUGAR, I COULDN'T
BELIEVE MY EYES.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.993
THERE WERE
THOUSANDS OF BOOKS

14:20.060 --> 14:23.663
JUST SITTING THERE
WAITING TO BE READ.

14:23.730 --> 14:26.466
DID THEY
LET YOU TAKE ONE?

14:26.533 --> 14:27.600
THE LIBRARIAN,

14:27.667 --> 14:31.638
A WHITE MAN THAT I HAD
KNOWN ALL MY LIFE,

14:31.704 --> 14:33.073
PUSHED ME OUT
INTO THE STREET

14:33.140 --> 14:35.608
AND TOLD ME
NEVER TO COME BACK.

14:37.577 --> 14:38.979
DID YOU CRY?

14:39.046 --> 14:41.314
ALL THE WAY HOME.

14:41.381 --> 14:46.353
AND THE NEXT DAY, I CRIED ALL
THE WAY BACK TO THE LIBRARY.

14:46.419 --> 14:47.554
YOU WENT BACK?

14:48.588 --> 14:53.260
EVERY DAY
FOR SIX MONTHS.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.963
PEOPLE STOPPED
AND STARED,

14:56.029 --> 14:58.165
CALLED ME NAMES,

14:58.231 --> 15:00.467
AND SOME
EVEN SPAT AT ME.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.637
WEREN'T YOU SCARED?

15:04.704 --> 15:06.039
WAS I EVER.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.442
AND SOMETIMES

15:09.509 --> 15:13.346
I WAS SORRY I EVER STARTED
THE WHOLE THING.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.982
BUT I DIDN'T QUIT.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.386
FINALLY...

15:19.452 --> 15:21.921
ONE RAINY DAY

15:21.989 --> 15:24.657
I WALKED IN
DRIPPING WET.

15:27.060 --> 15:33.400
AND THAT SAME MAN
THAT PUSHED ME OUT

15:33.466 --> 15:35.402
SHOOK HIS HEAD

15:35.468 --> 15:38.305
AND GAVE ME
A LIBRARY CARD.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.708
OH, WOW.

15:41.774 --> 15:46.446
AND FROM THAT DAY ON, EVERYBODY
COULD USE THAT LIBRARY.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.416
SUGAR...

15:51.584 --> 15:55.222
I REALIZE YOU'RE
HAVING A HARD TIME.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.191
BUT YOU'VE
GOT TO STAND UP

15:58.258 --> 16:01.228
FOR WHATEVER
YOU BELIEVE IN,

16:01.294 --> 16:04.064
OR THINGS
WILL NEVER CHANGE.

16:07.034 --> 16:10.170
THIS LIBRARY CARD

16:10.237 --> 16:16.176
IS PROOF THAT ONE PERSON
CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.048
YOU UNDERSTAND?

16:22.315 --> 16:24.951
COME HERE. LET ME
GIVE YOU SOME SUGAR.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.153
LOVE YOU.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.321
LOVE YOU TOO.

16:33.793 --> 16:36.763
GUYS, LOOK AT ALL THESE
IMPORTANT BLACK MEN AND WOMEN.

16:36.829 --> 16:40.167
WE'VE GOT SO MANY POSTERS,
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF WALLS.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.474
DR. GEORGE F. GRANT

16:47.540 --> 16:51.278
PATENTED THE FIRST
WOODEN GOLF TEE IN 1899.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.046
NOW, GEE, THAT'S IRONIC.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.847
HERE IT IS
92 YEARS LATER

16:54.914 --> 16:58.118
AND WE STILL CAN'T TEE OFF
AT SOME COUNTRY CLUBS.

17:00.153 --> 17:02.355
ALL DONE.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.590
WOW.

17:03.656 --> 17:04.891
IT LOOKS GREAT.

17:04.957 --> 17:07.094
IT SURE DOES.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.495
I'LL GET IT.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.998
STEVE, I COULDN'T HAVE
DONE THIS WITHOUT YOU.

17:12.065 --> 17:15.202
OH, PLEASE, LAURA,
YOU'RE MAKING ME BLUSH.

17:16.869 --> 17:20.073
I JUST DON'T GET WHY ARE PEOPLE
SO AFRAID OF OUR HISTORY?

17:20.140 --> 17:21.774
WELL, BECAUSE
IT'S DIFFERENT.

17:21.841 --> 17:27.280
AND BELIEVE YOU ME, I KNOW WHAT
BEING DIFFERENT IS ALL ABOUT.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.249
IT'S NOT SO MUCH
THAT YOU'RE DIFFERENT.

17:29.316 --> 17:31.251
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,

17:31.318 --> 17:34.121
WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE KIND OF...

17:34.187 --> 17:35.522
DIFFERENT.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.129
I'M A SQUARE PEG
IN A ROUND WORLD.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.764
AN ARGYLE IN A WORLD
OF TUBES SOCK'S.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.501
A ZIPPER IN
A WORLD OF VELCRO.

17:51.138 --> 17:54.006
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S OKAY.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.908
I DON'T MIND BEING DIFFERENT

17:55.975 --> 18:00.079
I LIKE WHO I AM AND I'M NOT
CHANGING FOR ANYBODY.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.115
WELL I ADMIRE YOU FOR THAT.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.216
OH, PSHAW!

18:03.283 --> 18:05.618
YOU'RE MAKING ME
BLUSH AGAIN.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.191
OH, LAURA,
THIS LOOKS GREAT!

18:11.258 --> 18:13.660
YOU'VE DONE
A WONDERFUL JOB.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.462
WHA...

18:15.528 --> 18:16.596
BU...

18:16.663 --> 18:18.398
OHH...

18:18.465 --> 18:19.466
OOH...

18:20.633 --> 18:22.969
IS THERE A PROBLEM,
PRINCIPAL SHIMATA?

18:23.035 --> 18:24.371
YES. A BIG ONE.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.473
MR. SHIMATA, IF YOU'D
JUST LET ME EXPLAIN.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.709
THOSE POSTERS--
HIGHLY INFLAMMATORY.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.111
WE HAVE A SERIOUS
SITUATION AT THIS SCHOOL.

18:32.179 --> 18:34.247
RACIAL TENSION.

18:34.314 --> 18:37.049
THESE POSTERS CAN
ONLY FAN THE FLAMES.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.485
AS PRINCIPAL
I WILL NOT ALLOW

18:38.551 --> 18:41.454
MY FLAMES TO BE FANNED.

18:41.521 --> 18:45.792
EASY, EDGAR. DON'T GET
YOUR SHORTS IN A KNOT.

18:45.858 --> 18:49.496
THESE POSTERS MUST BE
REMOVED IMMEDIATELY.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.898
[BELL RINGS]

19:06.379 --> 19:08.781
GARRETT A. MORGAN
INVENTED THE STOPLIGHT?

19:08.848 --> 19:10.183
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.687
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE
SO MANY BLACK INVENTORS.

19:14.754 --> 19:15.888
ME NEITHER.

19:19.926 --> 19:23.730
DR. DANIEL L. WELLS PERFORMED
THE FIRST OPEN-HEART SURGERY?

19:23.796 --> 19:25.365
I THOUGHT IT
WAS CHRISTIAN BARNARD.

19:25.432 --> 19:28.167
NO, HE DID
THE FIRST HEART TRANSPLANT.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.203
MR. SHIMATA,
THE POSTERS SEEM TO BE

19:30.270 --> 19:31.804
BRINGING
THE KIDS TOGETHER.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.641
HMM. JUST
AS I PREDICTED.

19:35.875 --> 19:39.279
ALL THIS INFORMATION
CAN BE FOUND IN THESE BOOKS.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.113
I MEAN, THESE WOULD
MAKE GREAT TEXTBOOKS

19:41.180 --> 19:42.415
FOR A BLACK HISTORY COURSE.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.984
OH, WELL,
I DON'T KNOW.

19:45.051 --> 19:47.820
EDGAR, A BLACK HISTORY COURSE
WOULD ONLY SERVE TO ENHANCE

19:47.887 --> 19:51.524
YOUR OTHERWISE DRAB
AND PREDICTABLE CURRICULUM.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.260
AND IT WOULD
UNDOUBTEDLY PREVENT

19:53.326 --> 19:54.761
THE UNFORTUNATE
RABBLE-ROUSING

19:54.827 --> 19:56.996
THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE
IN THESE HALLOWED HALLS

19:57.063 --> 19:58.798
THE PAST FEW DAYS.
AND FURTHERMORE--

20:04.271 --> 20:06.473
MR. SHIMATA, I'VE SPOKEN
TO SEVERAL TEACHERS,

20:06.539 --> 20:08.875
AND WE WOULD ALL WELCOME
THE OPPORTUNITY

20:08.941 --> 20:12.779
TO PRESENT A MORE BALANCED
VIEW OF HISTORY.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.847
WAY TO GO,
STOOBY-DOO.

20:17.083 --> 20:20.353
LAURA, THERE IS A SCHOOL
COMMITTEE MEETING NEXT MONTH.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.989
MAYBE YOU COULD COME AND
RECOMMEND A BLACK HISTORY CLASS

20:23.055 --> 20:25.224
BE MADE PART
OF THE CURRICULUM?

20:25.292 --> 20:26.626
I'LL BE THERE!

20:28.561 --> 20:29.696
OHH...

20:59.892 --> 21:00.993
SCREWDRIVER.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.763

21:24.751 --> 21:26.486
OKAY, RICH.

21:26.553 --> 21:29.722
NOW LET'S SEE IF
THIS OPERATION WAS A SUCCESS.

21:36.429 --> 21:39.499
HEY, RICH,
WE DID IT.

21:46.038 --> 21:48.508
[COUGH COUGH]

21:49.376 --> 21:52.579

FOR A NEW ONE.

22:00.753 --> 22:01.554
HI.

22:01.621 --> 22:03.055
HOW'D THE COMMITTEE
MEETING GO?

22:03.122 --> 22:05.892
YEAH, DID YOU GIVE THEM
THE OL' WINSLOW 1-2 PUNCH?

22:05.958 --> 22:08.160
WELL, I HATE TO BRAG...

22:08.227 --> 22:10.397
BUT I KNOCKED
'EM DEAD.

22:11.964 --> 22:14.934
I THINK WE HAVE A GOOD CHANCE
OF GETTING THE CLASS.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.836
THAT'S MY GIRL!

22:20.707 --> 22:21.674
GRANDMA...

22:21.741 --> 22:23.943
YES, HONEY.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.145

MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

OH, SWEETHEART.
