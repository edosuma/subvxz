WEBVTT

00:09.410 --> 00:10.711
- WHAT'S IT LIKE
TO GET DIVORCED?

00:10.744 --> 00:12.080
- OH, NO.
- THIS IS ABOUT COMMITTING

00:12.113 --> 00:13.547
TO THE STANDARD
THAT YOU SET.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.516
"EVEN IF I BEG FOR HELP,
DON'T LET ME OUT."

00:15.549 --> 00:17.351
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I'M DIVORCING YOU.

00:17.385 --> 00:18.652
IT'S THE END OF OUR MARRIAGE.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.654
WHY ARE YOU SLEEPING
IN MY OFFICE?

00:20.688 --> 00:22.022
- YOU PAY ME
IN COLLEGE CREDITS.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.391
CAN YOU TURN OFF
THE LIGHT?

00:23.424 --> 00:25.593
- HEY, I WANT YOU
TO MEET MY LAWYER, MARK.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.262
YOU'RE RIGHT--WE HAVE BEEN
HOLDING EACH OTHER BACK.

00:28.296 --> 00:29.697
- OH.
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT HER

00:29.730 --> 00:31.365
IS WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.000
- I'M FORREST MACNEIL,

00:33.033 --> 00:37.105
AND MY WIFE IS PROBABLY [bleep]
HER LAWYER RIGHT NOW.

00:37.138 --> 00:40.074
LIFE--IT'S LITERALLY
ALL WE HAVE.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.542
BUT IS IT ANY GOOD?

00:41.575 --> 00:43.277
I'M A REVIEWER,
BUT I DON'T REVIEW

00:43.311 --> 00:45.179
FOOD, BOOKS, OR MOVIES.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.115
I REVIEW LIFE ITSELF.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.117
VIVA THE REVOLUTION!

00:49.150 --> 00:52.386
[crowd cheering]

00:52.420 --> 00:54.688
AAH!

00:54.722 --> 00:57.691
[triumphant orchestration]

00:57.725 --> 01:02.996
*

01:03.030 --> 01:05.433
I'M FORREST MACNEIL,
AND THIS IS REVIEW,

01:05.466 --> 01:07.668
WHERE I'LL REVIEW
ANY LIFE EXPERIENCE

01:07.701 --> 01:09.137
YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT

01:09.137 --> 01:11.805
AND RATE IT
ON MY PATENTED FIVE-STAR SCALE.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.875
- I'M A.J. GIBBS, AND FORREST
USUALLY INTRODUCES ME.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.644
- YES, THAT'S TRUE.
I-I'M SORRY.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.379
I AM STILL SORT OF REELING

01:18.412 --> 01:20.948
FROM MY RECENT REVIEW
OF DIVORCE,

01:20.981 --> 01:23.617
IN WHICH I LOST MY HOME
AND APPARENTLY

01:23.651 --> 01:25.686
HALF OF MY INCOME
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.655
- WELL, AT LEAST
YOU DIDN'T LOSE YOUR JOB.

01:27.688 --> 01:30.057
- TRUE ENOUGH.
THIS SHOW HELPS PEOPLE.

01:30.158 --> 01:33.161
IT'S IMPORTANT WORK.
WHAT'S MY NEXT REVIEW, A.J.?

01:33.161 --> 01:36.397
- FIRST ONE UP
IS FROM KALAMAZOO, MICHIGAN.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.065
- I CAN OFTEN BE FOUND
MASTURBATING

01:38.166 --> 01:39.900
TO IMAGES OF CELEBRITIES,
BUT I WAS WONDERING

01:39.933 --> 01:42.570
WHAT'D IT BE LIKE
TO ACTUALLY SLEEP WITH ONE.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.473
- SLEEPING
WITH A CELEBRITY, HUH?

01:45.506 --> 01:47.007
[chuckles]
OKAY.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.343
FORREST MACNEIL GROUPIE.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.512
- DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT, FORREST.

01:51.545 --> 01:52.846
- WHAT'S THAT?
- DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.415
- WHAT?

01:54.448 --> 01:55.849
- YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE THINKING.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.418
- WELL, AS OFTEN HAPPENS,

01:57.451 --> 01:59.187
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:59.187 --> 02:04.057
BUT I AM OFF TO SLEEP
WITH A CELEBRITY.

02:04.091 --> 02:05.726
- YOU KNOW.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.495
- AS A NEWLY DIVORCED MAN,

02:07.528 --> 02:10.764
THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE SEX
WITH A GLAMOROUS FAMOUS PERSON

02:10.798 --> 02:13.066
SEEMED LIKE
JUST THE REVIEW I NEEDED.

02:13.100 --> 02:17.205
SO HALLE BERRY
AND ANGELINA JOLIE AND JLO

02:17.205 --> 02:19.307
ARE ALL SPOKEN FOR, HUH?

02:19.340 --> 02:20.808
- YEAH.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.076
- THE FIRST STEP
WAS FINDING AN AVAILABLE STAR.

02:23.110 --> 02:24.645
HMM, HERE'S SOMETHING.

02:24.678 --> 02:28.416
ASHLEY TISDALE IS HOSTING
A CHARITY EVENT HERE.

02:28.449 --> 02:31.084
WHAT ARE MY CHANCES OF SLEEPING
WITH ASHLEY TISDALE?

02:31.118 --> 02:32.986
BE HONEST.

02:35.055 --> 02:37.791
- REALLY GOOD.

02:37.825 --> 02:40.594
- ASHLEY TISDALE WAS NOT ONLY
THE SCENE-STEALING VILLAIN

02:40.628 --> 02:42.330
IN THE
HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL MOVIES.

02:42.363 --> 02:45.599
SHE WAS ALSO DEEPLY COMMITTED
TO STAMPING OUT BULLYING,

02:45.633 --> 02:48.269
AND THAT COMMITMENT
PUT HER WITHIN MY REACH.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.338
I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED
IN THE POWER

02:50.371 --> 02:52.373
OF POSITIVE THINKING.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.041
THAT'S WHY
I HAVE A CONDOM.

02:54.074 --> 02:55.943
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE
SOME ACTRESS RAISING MY CHILD.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.678
YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT.
[chuckles]

02:57.711 --> 03:00.714
THE HOST ARRIVED,
AND SHE WAS GORGEOUS.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.251
THERE WAS NO DENYING
THE WHIRLPOOL OF ENERGY

03:03.251 --> 03:05.453
SURROUNDING THIS CENTER
OF ATTENTION.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.120
WAS I STRUCK BY HER BEAUTY

03:07.154 --> 03:09.257
OR SEDUCED BY THE EFFECT
SHE HAD ON THE ROOM?

03:09.290 --> 03:11.525
HI. HOW ARE YOU?
WHAT A GREAT EVENT THIS IS.

03:11.559 --> 03:12.626
I JUST WANT TO SAY
KUDOS TO YOU.

03:12.660 --> 03:13.894
- EXCUSE ME.
- YES?

03:13.927 --> 03:18.266
- WHY ARE YOU HOLDING
A CONDOM?

03:18.266 --> 03:20.368
- YEAH.
[scoffs]

03:20.401 --> 03:22.069
MY INITIAL INTERACTION
WITH MISS TISDALE

03:22.102 --> 03:23.537
COULD HAVE GONE BETTER,

03:23.571 --> 03:26.307
AND ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY
SOON PRESENTED ITSELF.

03:26.340 --> 03:29.377
- ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE
A SURPRISE ADDITIONAL ITEM--

03:29.410 --> 03:34.982
A WONDERFUL PRIVATE DINNER
WITH MISS ASHLEY TISDALE.

03:35.015 --> 03:38.319
- AH.
- YES.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.754
- I HAD TO HAVE THIS.
- HOW ABOUT THAT?

03:40.788 --> 03:42.956
WE'RE GONNA START THIS ONE
AT $5,000.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.592
- YES, $5,000.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.760
- $5,000, RIGHT THERE
AT TABLE 2.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.296
FANTASTIC.
DO I HEAR $10,000? $10,000?

03:48.296 --> 03:51.064
- YES, YES, $10,000.
$10,000.

03:51.098 --> 03:54.668
- OKAY.
UH, $10,000, TABLE 2 ALSO.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.670
- YEAH--OH, I SEE.
- YEAH, YEAH, OKAY.

03:56.704 --> 03:59.440
DO I HEAR $15,000?
$15,000?

03:59.473 --> 04:01.475
$15,000?
- $15,000.

04:01.509 --> 04:04.645
- $15,000
TO THE DOTING FATHER

04:04.678 --> 04:06.847
OF THAT LUCKY
YOUNG LADY BACK THERE.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.416
NOW, DO I HEAR $20,000?
$20,000?

04:08.449 --> 04:11.652
- YEAH, $20,000.
- $20,000 FROM TABLE 2.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.687
ASHLEY, I THINK YOU'VE GOT
YOURSELF A FAN OVER THERE.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.389
- [laughs]

04:15.423 --> 04:18.091
- WHAT ABOUT IT, DAD?

04:18.125 --> 04:20.694
- $25,000.
- $25,000.

04:20.728 --> 04:24.197
WE'VE GOT OURSELVES A REAL
BIDDING WAR GOING ON HERE.

04:24.231 --> 04:27.501
DO I HEAR $30,000--
- $70,000.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.002
ALL RIGHT?

04:29.036 --> 04:31.572
- $70,000.
- $70,000, OKAY?

04:31.605 --> 04:33.006
WE DONE?

04:33.040 --> 04:35.343
- $70,000 GOING ONCE...

04:35.343 --> 04:37.511
GOING TWICE.

04:37.545 --> 04:40.113
- THAT'S IT, RIGHT?
- SOLD TO THAT GUY.

04:40.147 --> 04:43.183
- YES!
YES!

04:43.216 --> 04:45.419
OKAY, THANK YOU.

04:45.453 --> 04:49.590
$70,000, AND WORTH EVERY PENNY,
I HAVE NO DOUBT.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.426
[laughs]

04:52.460 --> 04:54.895
I LOOK FORWARD
TO OUR EVENING.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.430
- HEY, BUD.
- HEY.

04:56.464 --> 04:57.798
- HOW WAS IT?

04:57.831 --> 04:59.900
- AS MY DINNER WITH MISS TISDALE
DREW NEAR,

04:59.933 --> 05:02.370
I FELT A STRONG DESIRE
TO LET PEOPLE KNOW

05:02.370 --> 05:04.505
ABOUT MY CONNECTION
TO THIS FAMOUS BEAUTY

05:04.538 --> 05:08.175
TO FEEL SOME OF HER CELEBRITY
GLOW REFLECTED OFF OF MYSELF.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.544
LISTEN, I'M NOT
GONNA BE ABLE TO SPEND

05:10.578 --> 05:13.280
THE EVENING WITH ERIC
ON THURSDAY NIGHT, IT TURNS OUT.

05:13.381 --> 05:14.848
- OKAY, WELL,
I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU TO.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.617
THAT'S NOT YOUR NIGHT.
- OH, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.019
YEAH, YEAH, WELL, I JUST HAVE
A DATE THAT NIGHT.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.988
- A DATE?
OH.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.623
WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.659
- YEAH, YEAH, IT'S ACTUALLY
SOMEONE YOU KNOW.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.160
YEAH--NOT PERSONALLY,

05:27.194 --> 05:29.463
BUT FROM THE WORLD
OF MOVIES AND TELEVISION.

05:29.497 --> 05:31.965
IT'S, UH, ASHLEY TISDALE?

05:31.999 --> 05:33.166
- I'M SORRY?
- YEAH.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.835
- WHO IS IT?
- ASHLEY TISDALE.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.169
- OH.
- YES.

05:36.203 --> 05:37.971
- HUH.
- YEAH, SHE AND I ARE GOING OUT

05:38.005 --> 05:39.206
FOR AMERICAN BISTRO FOOD...

05:39.239 --> 05:40.474
- ARE YOU?
- ON THURSDAY.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.576
IT SHOULD BE--
IT SHOULD BE NICE.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.578
- WHAT, DID YOU WIN
A DATE WITH HER

05:44.612 --> 05:45.979
AT SOME CHARITY AUCTION
OR SOMETHING?

05:46.013 --> 05:48.982
- [laughs]

05:49.016 --> 05:50.918
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?
- [sighs]

05:50.951 --> 05:53.020
FORREST, PLEASE TELL ME
YOU DIDN'T PAY $10,000

05:53.053 --> 05:56.824
TO HAVE DINNER
WITH A FAMOUS PERSON.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.893
- I DID NOT PAY $10,000
TO HAVE DINNER WITH ANYONE.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.795
- WELL, GOOD,
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE PATHETIC.

06:01.829 --> 06:04.998
- WOULD IT REALLY?
- YEAH.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.300
ARE WE DONE HERE?
- ABSOLUTELY.

06:07.334 --> 06:09.803
IF JUST THE IDEA
OF A DATE WITH A CELEBRITY

06:09.837 --> 06:11.839
WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE
MY EX-WIFE JEALOUS,

06:11.872 --> 06:14.007
HOW WOULD SHE REACT
TO THE ROUND OF SEX

06:14.041 --> 06:16.777
I WOULD SOON HAVE
WITH MISS ASHLEY TISDALE?

06:20.881 --> 06:22.450
- [sighs]

06:22.483 --> 06:26.454
I COURTED SUZANNE
FOR AN EXCRUCIATING 13 MONTHS

06:26.487 --> 06:29.523
BEFORE SHE ALLOWED ME TO BE
PHYSICALLY INTIMATE WITH HER.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.124
WHATEVER MAGIC
I WORKED THEN,

06:31.158 --> 06:32.693
I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO CONDENSE

06:32.726 --> 06:34.495
INTO THE TIME IT TAKES
TO EAT THIS MEAL

06:34.528 --> 06:36.864
OF AMERICAN BISTRO FOOD.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.131
OH.
- HI.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.967
- YES, HELLO.
- I'M ASHLEY.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.470
AND THIS IS MY BODYGUARD.
- OH, OKAY.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.304
WONDERFUL. LISTEN, HEY,
I GOT YOU THESE FLOWERS.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.139
THESE ARE FOR YOU.
- OH, THANK YOU.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.476
- YES, IT'S GOOD.
YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.210
- OH, THANK YOU.
- YES, THANK YOU

06:50.243 --> 06:51.845
FOR LOOKING SO BEAUTIFUL.

06:51.879 --> 06:54.181
- AND THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR $70,000 CONTRIBUTION.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.716
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
I HAVE A SON

06:55.749 --> 06:57.317
WHO'S EXTREMELY SHORT
FOR HIS AGE.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.853
- OH, SO YOU'RE MARRIED?
- QUITE THE CONTRARY.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.990
I AM RECENTLY DIVORCED
AND GETTING OUT THERE.

07:03.023 --> 07:06.093
SO YOUR TIMING IS PRETTY GOOD.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.095
YES.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.730
YEAH.
- [chuckles nervously]

07:09.763 --> 07:13.567
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
I DABBLE IN PALM READING.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.102
MAY I?

07:15.135 --> 07:16.970
- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOOD.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.939
I'M GOOD. I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE
IN THAT STUFF.

07:18.972 --> 07:21.609
- OH, WELL, IT'S MAINLY
JUST SORT OF FOR FUN,

07:21.642 --> 07:25.078
TO TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
YOUR HEART LINE.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.947
- NO.
- YEAH.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.249
MM, OKAY.
YEAH.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.785
MY--MY LOVE LINE,
IF IT'S THIS ONE, IS ALL--

07:31.819 --> 07:33.320
GOES ALL THE WAY AROUND.

07:33.353 --> 07:35.155
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
A PALM READ--

07:35.188 --> 07:38.526
- I'M--I'M GOOD.

07:38.526 --> 07:41.428
- UM, YOU--I IMAGINE
THAT BEING A CELEBRITY

07:41.529 --> 07:42.963
IS VERY, VERY STRESSFUL.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.533
- NO, ACTUALLY,
IT'S REALLY FUN.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.334
IT'S REALLY FUN.
- WITH CERTAIN STRESSES,

07:47.367 --> 07:51.204
IN TERMS OF
KEEPING UP PUBLIC APPEARANCES

07:51.238 --> 07:52.439
AND--AND ALL THAT.
- NO.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.441
I-I REALLY ENJOY IT.
I LOVE IT.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.443
- WELL, NO WONDER
YOU'RE CARRYING ALL THAT TENSION

07:56.544 --> 07:57.878
IN YOUR SHOULDERS.
- I'M CARRYING--NO.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.046
NO, NO, NO.
- SO WHY DON'T I SEE

07:59.079 --> 08:00.581
IF I CAN HELP YOU
WITH THAT?

08:00.614 --> 08:02.282
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU DON'T NEED TO GET UP.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.917
YOU DON'T NEED TO GET UP.
- NO, WELL, I'LL--

08:03.951 --> 08:05.619
I THINK I'LL JUST GIVE YOU
A LITTLE BACK RUB HERE.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.087
IT SHOULD'VE COME
AS NO SURPRISE

08:07.120 --> 08:09.189
THAT MISS TISDALE
WAS ACTING COY.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.891
TO A CELEBRITY,
AN EVENING OF SEX

08:10.924 --> 08:13.093
IS A COVETED PRIZE
THAT CANNOT BE HANDED OUT

08:13.126 --> 08:15.362
TO JUST ANYONE
WITH NO APPARENT BENEFIT

08:15.395 --> 08:17.430
IN THE FORM OF DRUGS
OR CAREER ADVANCEMENT.

08:17.464 --> 08:18.966
- I'M OKAY.
- OKAY.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.300
- I'M JUST EXCITED FOR DINNER.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.570
- GOOD.
SO, UH...

08:22.570 --> 08:26.273
- OH, GOOD.
THANKS.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.441
- OKAY.

08:28.475 --> 08:30.644
I'M JUST GONNA BE
VERY BLUNT WITH YOU.

08:30.678 --> 08:31.645
- OH, BOY.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.581
- MY INTEREST IN THIS DATE

08:33.581 --> 08:36.383
ACTUALLY HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE FOOD,

08:36.416 --> 08:38.085
EVEN THOUGH
THIS RIB TASTER FOR TWO

08:38.118 --> 08:40.654
IS DEFINITELY CALLING TO ME,
NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

08:40.688 --> 08:44.124
BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED

08:44.157 --> 08:47.394
IN GETTING OUT OF HERE
AND GOING STRAIGHT TO DESSERT...

08:47.427 --> 08:48.829
[cell phone rings]

08:48.862 --> 08:50.330
- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AM SO SORRY.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.332
I HAVE TO TAKE THIS.
HELLO?

08:52.365 --> 08:54.134
- FAKE PHONE CALL,
FAKE PHONE CALL,

08:54.167 --> 08:56.069
FAKE PHONE CALL.
- WHAT?

08:56.103 --> 08:57.504
- FAKE PHONE CALL,
FAKE PHONE CALL,

08:57.605 --> 08:59.840
FAKE PHONE CALL.
- RIGHT NOW?

08:59.873 --> 09:01.508
- FAKE PHONE CALL,
FAKE PHONE CALL,

09:01.609 --> 09:03.143
FAKE PHONE CALL.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.378
- OH, MY GOD, OKAY.
I AM SO SORRY.

09:05.412 --> 09:08.148
A BAD THING HAPPENED,
AND IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.183
AND I'VE GOT TO GO.
I'M SO SORRY.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.685
- NO PROBLEM.
LISTEN, AS I WAS SAYING--

09:11.719 --> 09:13.153
- NO, NO, NO, NO, PLEASE--
PLEASE, STAY HERE.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.622
JUST ENJOY YOUR DINNER.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.256
- I HAVE NO INTEREST
IN THE FOOD AT ALL.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.325
- EAT YOUR DINNER.

09:18.358 --> 09:22.362
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR $70,000 CONTRIBUTION.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.636
- AH...

09:28.636 --> 09:30.638
[laughs]

09:30.638 --> 09:34.007
"THANK YOU
FOR YOUR $70,000 CONTRIBUTION,"

09:34.041 --> 09:38.045
IN THIS CASE
MEANS I WILL NOT BE HAVING SEX.

09:43.483 --> 09:47.788
I WILL HAVE
THE RIB TASTER FOR TWO, PLEASE.

09:55.095 --> 09:58.531
WELL, I HAVE JUST EATEN
TWO MASSIVE PLATES OF RIBS,

09:58.565 --> 10:01.101
BUT I'M STILL GOING
TO TRY AND HAVE SEX TONIGHT.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.903
THIS IS A HOLLYWOOD HOT SPOT,

10:02.936 --> 10:06.139
AND I'VE BEEN SCANNING THE ROOM
FOR CELEBRITIES.

10:06.173 --> 10:09.910
I THINK I MAY HAVE FOUND ONE.

10:09.943 --> 10:13.613
[clears throat]
PARDON ME, MISS TAYLOR SWIFT.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.548
I WAS--
OH--OH, I'M SORRY.

10:15.582 --> 10:17.384
SHE WAS NOT TAYLOR SWIFT,

10:17.417 --> 10:19.119
BUT SHE WAS TAMMY CASWELL,

10:19.152 --> 10:21.554
AND SHE WASTED NO TIME
IDENTIFYING HERSELF

10:21.588 --> 10:23.991
AS A REAL HOUSEWIFE
OF BEVERLY HILLS--

10:24.024 --> 10:26.326
A SHOW I HAD HEARD OF
BUT NEVER SEEN.

10:26.359 --> 10:30.263
- YOU KNOW, I, UH, DABBLE
IN PALM READING A BIT.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.799
- HOW'S MY PASSION LINE?

10:31.832 --> 10:33.967
- BECAUSE I WAS STILL
LIVING IN MY OFFICE

10:34.001 --> 10:36.403
AND MY INTERN, JOSH,
HAD CALLED DIBS ON THE COUCH,

10:36.436 --> 10:38.605
WE WENT TO HER PLACE.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.573
I WILL SPARE YOU
THE DETAILS,

10:40.607 --> 10:43.643
BUT SEX WITH MISS CASWELL
WAS EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT.

10:43.677 --> 10:44.644
OKAY.

10:44.678 --> 10:45.913
REAL HOUSEWIVES...

10:45.946 --> 10:47.280
THE KNOWLEDGE
THAT SHE WAS KNOWN

10:47.314 --> 10:49.316
TO MILLIONS
OF TV VIEWERS, HOWEVER,

10:49.349 --> 10:51.418
ENABLED ME TO HAVE SEX
WITH THE FIRST WOMAN

10:51.451 --> 10:53.020
I'D BEEN WITH
SINCE MY DIVORCE.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.455
IT WAS QUITE A THRILL
TO GET TO SLEEP WITH SOMEONE

10:55.488 --> 10:57.190
FROM THAT SHOW.
[chuckles]

10:57.224 --> 10:58.425
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.828
- WHO?

11:00.861 --> 11:03.396
- YOU.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.033
YOU WERE NOT
ON THE TELEVISION SHOW?

11:06.066 --> 11:10.170
- I'M A HOUSEWIFE, AND I LIVE
IN BEVERLY HILLS ADJACENT.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.006
- BUT I WAS TROUBLED TO LEARN
THAT TAMMY CASWELL

11:13.040 --> 11:15.608
WAS NOT AN ACTUAL CELEBRITY.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.577
AND MY SEARCH CONTINUED.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.113
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
HEY!

11:20.147 --> 11:23.150
HEY!
YOU WANT TO GREEK ME?

11:26.453 --> 11:27.988
- DESPITE SPENDING
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY

11:28.021 --> 11:29.790
AND A DEMORALIZING EVENING
WITH A MARRIED WOMAN,

11:29.823 --> 11:32.192
I STILL HAD NOT SLEPT
WITH A CELEBRITY.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.593
- THERE YOU GO.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.528
SHE'LL LET
YOU SLEEP WITH HER.

11:35.562 --> 11:37.464
- AUTHOR DIANE MASSEY.

11:37.497 --> 11:41.769
DOES SHE COUNT AS A CELEBRITY?
- FOR YOU? YES.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.670
- "I WAS...

11:43.771 --> 11:47.841
"NUMB WITH SORROW.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.310
"ROY WAS GONE,

11:50.343 --> 11:54.948
AND I WOULD HAVE TO LIVE MY LIFE
WITHOUT HIM."

11:54.982 --> 11:57.317
- BEHIND ME IS DIANE MASSEY,

11:57.350 --> 12:01.521
ONE-TIME TRAFFIC REPORTER
FOR K.L.O.W.'S LOCAL NEWS.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.923
SOME PEOPLE
CONSIDER HER TO BE

12:02.956 --> 12:06.226
THE ASHLEY TISDALE
OF TRAFFIC REPORTING.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.796
SHE HAS WRITTEN A MEMOIR
ABOUT COPING WITH THE DEATH

12:08.829 --> 12:10.964
OF HER HUSBAND, ROY.

12:10.998 --> 12:13.801
HE DIED IN A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT,
IRONICALLY ENOUGH.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.635
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING?
[light applause]

12:15.668 --> 12:17.404
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR WRITING THIS.

12:17.437 --> 12:18.806
- OF COURSE.

12:18.806 --> 12:21.241
- RECENTLY, UH...

12:21.274 --> 12:23.243
I RECENTLY LOST MY WIFE.

12:23.276 --> 12:27.815
DIANE WAS A SWEET, SAD WOMAN
IN A HIGHLY VULNERABLE STATE.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.818
I GOT TO HAND IT TO LUCILLE.
SHE CALLED IT.

12:30.851 --> 12:35.122
AND DIANE'S NEED FOR LOVING CARE
MADE MY TASK ALL TOO EASY.

12:35.155 --> 12:39.159
- IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

12:39.192 --> 12:40.828
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THERE IS.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.830
- OKAY.
OH.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.832
YEAH, OH. OH, GOD.
- MM-HMM.

12:44.832 --> 12:47.968
THE GLAMOUR OF SLEEPING WITH
A FAMOUS WOMAN WAS UNDENIABLE.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.003
BUT ULTIMATELY,
WE WERE JUST PEOPLE,

12:50.037 --> 12:53.841
AND OUR SEXUAL ENCOUNTER WOULD
END THE WAY THEY USUALLY DO.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.909
- OH, NO!

12:55.943 --> 12:59.612
[crying]
OH, ROY!

12:59.646 --> 13:01.514
OH.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.516
BRING ME ROY.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.053
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT--I'M SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.

13:06.086 --> 13:09.256
- GIVE ME RO--
BRING ME HIS ASHES.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.258
BRING ME ROY.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.994
[sobbing]

13:14.027 --> 13:16.729
- ALL RIGHT.
- BRING ME HIS ASHES.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.073
OH, MY ROY.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.540
OH, MY ROY.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.609
[sobbing]

13:29.642 --> 13:32.679
- I'LL PROBABLY, UH--
PROBABLY GET GOING THERE.

13:32.712 --> 13:34.948
- YOU CAN CALL ME IF YOU WANT.
- OKAY.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.284
- GOOD FOR YOU, FORREST--
ON THE REBOUND.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.585
- THANK YOU.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.687
- THE SADDEST REBOUND
ANYONE EVER SAW.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.055
- WITHOUT A DOUBT.

13:42.089 --> 13:44.958
SLEEPING WITH A CELEBRITY--
ONE STAR.

13:46.759 --> 13:49.596
I SUPPOSE THERE'S STILL
MUCH MORE LIFE TO EXPLORE, HUH?

13:49.629 --> 13:52.132
- THERE SURE IS, FORREST.
- HA HA.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.934
SO WHAT'S MY NEXT REVIEW?

13:53.967 --> 13:57.637
- OKAY, TEN-YEAR-OLD DANNY CRUZ
FROM PERRYTON, TEXAS,

13:57.670 --> 13:59.239
POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE.

13:59.272 --> 14:03.443
HE WANTS TO KNOW
"IS IT COOL TO BE BATMAN?"

14:03.476 --> 14:05.045
HEY.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.814
- WHO CARES, DANNY?

14:07.915 --> 14:10.918
LET'S FIND OUT.
[clears throat]

14:13.420 --> 14:16.189
MY FORAY INTO THE WORLD
OF CELEBRITY LOVEMAKING

14:16.223 --> 14:18.158
HAD LEFT ME
IN A STATE OF DEPRESSION

14:18.191 --> 14:20.994
THAT MADE THIS TASK
FEEL ESPECIALLY POINTLESS.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.063
IT WAS BATMAN, RIGHT?
- BATMAN! FLY!

14:23.096 --> 14:25.198
- ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.973
I MISSED MY BATWOMAN, SUZANNE,

14:33.006 --> 14:34.841
AND MY BAT-SON...

14:34.942 --> 14:36.243
BAT-EVERYTHING.

14:36.276 --> 14:39.312
HEY, THE BIKE LANES
ARE CLEARLY MARKED.

14:39.346 --> 14:42.315
- [bleep] YOU, BATMAN!

14:42.349 --> 14:43.683
- [bleep] YOU.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.685
[bleep].

14:45.718 --> 14:48.488
BUT I DID MY BEST
TO FIND CRIMINAL MASTERMINDS

14:48.521 --> 14:50.390
OR AS CLOSE
AS I COULD COME.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.159
EXCUSE ME.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.727
THIS SHOPPING CART
DOES NOT BELONG TO YOU.

14:54.761 --> 14:57.264
I'LL BRING IT BACK
TO THE FOOD SAVER.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.665
- WHAT?

14:58.698 --> 15:00.167
- I'M BATMAN.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.235
IT WAS CLEAR TO ME
THAT THE IDEA

15:02.269 --> 15:04.071
OF A PRIVATE CITIZEN
FIGHTING CRIME

15:04.104 --> 15:06.339
IS OF NO VALUE WHATSOEVER.

15:08.608 --> 15:09.977
THAT SHOULD BE LEFT
TO POLICE OFFICERS

15:09.977 --> 15:11.511
WITH THE PROPER TRAINING,
EQUIPMENT,

15:11.544 --> 15:13.580
AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO SOCIETY.

15:13.613 --> 15:17.985
HOW THIS NEVER OCCURRED
TO BATMAN IS BEYOND ME.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.987
YOO-HOO.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.421
YOU'RE BREAKING THE LAW
RIGHT NOW.

15:21.454 --> 15:22.589
YOU MIND COMING WITH ME
TO THE POLICE STATION?

15:22.622 --> 15:24.524
- HA HA.
IT'S BATMAN.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.994
- STOP--OW.
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.129
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
[cell phone rings]

15:29.162 --> 15:32.532
- WHAT?
- CONTROL YOURSELF.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.167
HELLO?
- WHERE ARE YOU?

15:34.201 --> 15:35.535
WE'RE AT THE COURTHOUSE.
- WHAT?

15:35.568 --> 15:37.004
NO.
- I DON'T KNOW--

15:37.004 --> 15:39.472
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, THAT WAS TOMORROW.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.441
OH, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.475
I'M HERE.
I JUST GOT HERE.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.277
WHAT FLOOR
ARE YOU GUYS ON?

15:44.311 --> 15:45.812
OKAY.
WELL, WHICH WAY IS IT?

15:45.845 --> 15:47.847
WHICH WAY DO YOU GO IN
ONCE YOU'RE UP TOP,

15:47.880 --> 15:49.349
ONCE YOU'RE AT THE BEGINNING?

15:49.382 --> 15:50.783
OH.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.719
OH, YOU CAME IN
THROUGH THE PARKING GARAGE?

15:52.752 --> 15:54.154
WELL, WHEN YOU'RE IN THE LOBBY,
IS IT ALL

15:54.187 --> 15:58.025
ONE LOBBY FOR EVERYTHING,
OR IS IT...?

15:58.025 --> 16:00.460
IF YOU'RE STANDING
ON THE SIDEWALK--HANG ON.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.630
HEY, YOU GUYS, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE FAMILY COURT IS?

16:03.663 --> 16:06.399
WHAT FL--OR WHICH ENTRANCE
YOU GO IN FOR FAMILY COURT?

16:06.433 --> 16:08.268
IS IT THE MIDDLE?
OKAY, THANK YOU.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.103
YEAH, I GOT IT.
I'M GOING IN THE MIDDLE DOOR.

16:10.137 --> 16:13.106
[elevator beeping]

16:15.142 --> 16:16.909
- FORREST?
- YES.

16:16.943 --> 16:19.279
SUZANNE, CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU
FOR JUST ONE SECOND, PLEASE?

16:19.312 --> 16:21.314
JUST ONE SECOND, PLEASE.

16:21.348 --> 16:22.749
- WHY ARE YOU DRESSED
LIKE THIS?

16:22.782 --> 16:25.085
ARE YOU GOING CRAZY?
- NO.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.554
LET'S NOT DO THIS.
I DON'T WANT TO BE DIVORCED.

16:27.587 --> 16:28.888
LET'S JUST GO--
- OKAY, FORREST,

16:28.921 --> 16:30.257
I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU ARE NOT

16:30.290 --> 16:32.159
IN THE BEST FRAME OF MIND
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

16:32.192 --> 16:34.794
- I AM THINKING VERY CLEARLY.
- YOU ARE CLEARLY NOT.

16:34.827 --> 16:38.931
BUT I AM CERTAIN
THAT THIS IS BEST FOR US, OKAY?

16:38.965 --> 16:40.300
- HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

16:40.333 --> 16:41.768
WE HAVE A LIFE TOGETHER.
- I CAN'T--

16:41.801 --> 16:43.736
- MACNEIL!

16:43.770 --> 16:45.738
- [sighs]

16:45.772 --> 16:46.973
- SUZANNE--SUZANNE.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.808
- STOP IT.
I'M SORRY.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.244
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

16:51.278 --> 16:52.612
- THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE WEDNESDAY.

16:52.645 --> 16:55.948
- I WAS LOOKING
AT LAST YEAR'S CALENDAR.

16:55.982 --> 16:59.852
- [sighing]

17:02.989 --> 17:04.657
- ...WITH ALL OTHER ASSETS
HELD IN TRUST

17:04.691 --> 17:07.094
UNTIL THE TIME STIPULATED.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.795
- AGREED.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.830
- WELL, SHALL WE MOVE ON
TO CUSTODY?

17:10.863 --> 17:13.733
- I THINK WE CAN AGREE
ON JOINT CUSTODY.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.902
50/50.
- ACTUALLY, NO.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.670
MY CLIENT FEELS
THAT SOLE CUSTODY

17:17.704 --> 17:19.406
WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTEREST
OF THE CHILD.

17:19.439 --> 17:24.010
- SOLE CUSTODY
BY WHICH PARENT?

17:24.111 --> 17:27.114
- MY--MY CLIENT.
- ON WHAT GROUNDS?

17:27.147 --> 17:29.682
- THERE ARE GRAVE CONCERNS
ABOUT MR. MACNEIL'S ABILITY

17:29.716 --> 17:31.584
TO BE A FIT PARENT.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.753
- THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.522
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN
TALKING ABOUT?

17:35.555 --> 17:36.756
SUZANNE.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.291
- IN RECENT WEEKS,
MR. MACNEIL

17:38.325 --> 17:40.427
HAD A DRUG-INDUCED
PSYCHOTIC EPISODE

17:40.460 --> 17:41.461
WHILE SUPERVISING
HIS SON'S CAMPING TRIP.

17:41.494 --> 17:42.962
- [sighs]
- MM-HMM.

17:42.995 --> 17:44.864
- HE TOOK MONEY
FROM THE BOY'S COLLEGE FUND

17:44.897 --> 17:47.134
TO PURCHASE
A $4,000 SEX DOLL.

17:47.167 --> 17:51.138
HE ATTENDED PROM AS THE DATE
OF A 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL

17:51.171 --> 17:53.306
AND OVERDOSED ON COCAINE
AT SAID PROM.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.708
HE IS AN AVOWED RACIST

17:55.742 --> 17:59.212
AND MOST RECENTLY
CONSUMED PANCAKES

17:59.246 --> 18:02.849
TO THE POINT
OF ENDANGERING HIS OWN LIFE.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.251
- IS THAT ALL?

18:04.284 --> 18:05.852
- WELL, HE SHOWED UP
TO A CUSTODY HEARING

18:05.885 --> 18:08.755
DRESSED AS BATMAN
AND COVERED IN HIS OWN URINE.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.923
- IS ALL OF THIS TRUE?

18:14.161 --> 18:16.663
- IT'S NOT MY URINE.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.903
AND JUST LIKE THAT,
WITHOUT WARNING,

18:23.936 --> 18:26.473
I HAD LOST MY FAMILY.

18:26.506 --> 18:29.376
THE INJUSTICE WAS UNREMITTING.

18:29.409 --> 18:30.810
AND THEN IT HIT ME

18:30.843 --> 18:32.979
THAT THIS WAS EXACTLY
HOW BRUCE WAYNE FELT

18:33.012 --> 18:35.182
AFTER THE MURDER
OF HIS PARENTS.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.983
I COULD USE THAT.

18:37.016 --> 18:38.885
MY EARLIER ATTEMPT
TO LIVE AS BATMAN

18:38.918 --> 18:41.821
WAS HALFHEARTED JEST,
THE STUFF OF SCHUMACHER.

18:41.854 --> 18:45.325
NOW, ON BEHALF OF THOSE
WHO CRY OUT FOR MOTHER JUSTICE,

18:45.358 --> 18:47.560
I WAS REBORN.

18:47.594 --> 18:50.263
- DUDE, I GAVE YOU A 20.

18:50.297 --> 18:53.400
- THOUGH I DID NOT KNOW WHICH
ONE OF THESE MEN WAS RIGHT,

18:53.433 --> 18:55.335
I NOW UNDERSTOOD
THAT CIVILIZED QUIBBLING

18:55.368 --> 18:56.736
GETS YOU NOWHERE.

18:56.769 --> 19:00.106
TO SAVE GOTHAM,
ACTION WOULD BE REQUIRED.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.853
- YEAH.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.355
DUDE, YOU'RE BADASS.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.390
- GET OUT.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.698
COME ON.

19:25.732 --> 19:26.866
[doorbell chimes]

19:26.899 --> 19:29.902
[vending machine beeping]

19:33.240 --> 19:35.742
NO.

19:35.775 --> 19:40.780
NO!

19:50.290 --> 19:51.724
I'M BATMAN.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.771
YOU TOOK MY OFFICE.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.473
I WANT YOU OUT.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.308
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
I'VE GOT DIBS ON THE OFFICE.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.576
- [grunts]

20:09.609 --> 20:10.877
- STOP.
- GET OUT, GET OUT.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.144
HEY.

20:12.178 --> 20:13.780
GET OUT OF MY OFFICE.
- STOP--OW!

20:13.813 --> 20:16.249
- THIS IS A WORKPLACE.
- YOU DON'T PAY ME!

20:16.283 --> 20:17.750
- IT DOESN'T MATTER!

20:17.784 --> 20:18.751
GET UP.
GET OUT OF HERE.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.253
TAKE ALL YOUR CRAP.

20:20.287 --> 20:21.821
THIS IS THE BATCAVE.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.890
INTERNS DON'T SLEEP
IN THE BATCAVE.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.392
- IT'S NOT YOUR BATCAVE.
IT'S FULL OF YOUR--

20:25.425 --> 20:27.059
- THESE DRUGS
ARE GONNA MELT YOUR MIND.

20:27.093 --> 20:28.828
- THERE'S NO DRUGS.
IT'S JUST A BONG.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.162
- SHUT UP.

20:30.196 --> 20:31.564
AS DAWN CAME,
I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND

20:31.598 --> 20:32.999
THAT A QUEST FOR JUSTICE

20:33.032 --> 20:36.736
WAS ONLY PART OF WHAT FUELS
A GOOD BATMAN.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.805
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
THERE TOO--

20:38.838 --> 20:41.941
SOMETHING LURKING
IN THE SHADOWS OF A SOUL,

20:41.974 --> 20:44.076
SOMETHING ABOUT A NAME.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.145
IT'S CALLED "RAGE."

20:46.178 --> 20:49.048
BEING BATMAN--
FOUR STARS.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.090
- HEY.

20:58.124 --> 20:59.759
HEY.

21:06.633 --> 21:09.836
GET BACK HERE, CAPED BASTARD!
