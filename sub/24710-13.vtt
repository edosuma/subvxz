-Good morning.
-OFFICER: Hey, how's it goin', Danny?

00:32.323 --> 00:35.035
Who called in the DOA?
And don't tell me it's that big queen.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.620
The body's over here.
Looks like it's been dumped.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.706
We got her. DOA got a name?

00:40.040 --> 00:43.501
There's ID in her wallet
for an Elvira Iglesias.

00:45.211 --> 00:48.923
How in the hell's a guy like that figure
he's got a future as a female whore?

00:49.049 --> 00:51.384
Yeah, he must've had a very poor
guidance counselor.

00:51.509 --> 00:52.802
Uh... You found the body?

00:52.927 --> 00:55.847
I will never look down another
excavation hole.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.099
(SIGHS) Thank God, she wasn't face up,

00:58.183 --> 01:00.393
or else I’d have died on the spot,
from the shock.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.854
-DIANE: Hmm.
-Who is it? Do you know?

01:03.021 --> 01:06.649
Uh... There's some ID on the body
for Elvira Iglesias.

01:06.733 --> 01:10.612
-That's Elvie? Oh, my God.
-What was Elvie's story?

01:11.488 --> 01:15.700
-She's a Pisces, if that'd help.
-Oh. Yeah. That's a place to start.

-Fancy wants you and me back at the house.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.794
-DANNY: Why?
-I don't know. Let me tell them.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.962
I wish I had your figure, honey.

01:29.130 --> 01:31.800
-Do you work out?
-Aerobics, punch the bag.

01:32.133 --> 01:34.636
Some of my tricks, they have me
throw 'em around a little.

01:35.303 --> 01:37.597
Maybe if I got methodical about that.
(CHUCKLES)

01:37.722 --> 01:39.933
Fancy wants me and him back at the house.

01:40.391 --> 01:42.560
You wanna, uh, take a look at Elvie
for us, Topaz?

01:42.727 --> 01:46.106
No. Thank you very much.
It's already been a full mornin'.

01:46.648 --> 01:47.690
All right. Okay.

01:49.609 --> 01:52.070
-Jill and you are gonna take this?
-Yeah. What's it look like?

01:52.195 --> 01:54.823
Uh, big bruise above her left eye.
No ligature marks.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.867
-I didn't get under the dress.
-Anything else in the wallet?

01:57.992 --> 02:00.620
Uh, no. Just the one piece
of Social Security ID.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.457
Either they had her in a car
and dumped her here,

02:04.541 --> 02:07.585
or someone on one of those upper floors
oughta be pitchin' for the Yankees.

02:10.713 --> 02:14.926

I could possibly get a lift?

Thanks, John.

04:09.123 --> 04:10.250
How's it goin'?

04:10.333 --> 04:12.919
This is Lieutenant Graham
from the 2‐7. Danny Sorenson.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.630
Lieutenant. How's it goin', Sarge?

04:15.755 --> 04:18.633
-It's Detective Dornan.
-What happened?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.760
BILL:
Oh, that's what it's about, Sipowicz.

04:20.885 --> 04:23.263
Thought I’d come up here
and let you know I was demoted,

04:23.388 --> 04:25.556
and bring my new boss to keep me company.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.351
Maybe if we talked
about what we are here for...

04:28.685 --> 04:31.604
(INHALES) Detective Dornan
made a collar in the 2-7.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.023
The perp puts at least four crates
of weapons

04:34.107 --> 04:35.608
in the apartment where he bought his gun.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.318
The supplier's apartment
is in our precinct?

04:37.527 --> 04:38.945
-Yeah.
-Probably not right

04:39.028 --> 04:42.573
pushing off collaring the suppliers
on you guys to work by yourselves.

04:44.742 --> 04:47.120
Absolutely.
Detective Dornan should work the warrant.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.914
I was talking
about the supervisory presence.

04:50.039 --> 04:51.582
Sure, boss.

04:52.542 --> 04:56.504
-Lieutenant, want to supervise a warrant?
-No, Lieutenant Fancy's probably busy.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.589
No. I'll supervise.

05:04.512 --> 05:07.223
I guess you don't learn
from your mistakes, do you, Dornan?

05:07.307 --> 05:09.934
You know us colored folks, slow learners.

05:18.609 --> 05:20.028
Dornan, what the hell is goin' on?

05:20.111 --> 05:21.863
-You gonna ask me that, Sipowicz?
-Meanin' what?

05:21.988 --> 05:23.406
You're lucky
I don't throw you out that window.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.575
-You don't think I can do it?
-Take it easy, Sarge.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.577
Oh, you gonna get in my face too,
you little pisspot?

05:27.744 --> 05:28.661
Don't call him "Sarge."

05:28.786 --> 05:30.079
Oh, I'll throw you
through the same window.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.372
-Oh, yeah?
-I'll put the both of you

05:31.497 --> 05:33.708
-through it at the same time.
-Dornan!

05:40.214 --> 05:43.092

-What? Were ya pickin' up desk supplies?
-Andy, I thought you come in here to piss.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.279
Did you hear what he accused me of, huh?
This... this arrogant Dornan.

06:45.363 --> 06:48.408
He had an accusatory tone.
I didn't take his exact reference.

06:48.658 --> 06:52.703
I took his reference, believe me.
He's gonna throw me through a window?

06:52.829 --> 06:54.872
-You were good about that.
-What?

06:55.039 --> 06:57.542
You were good, not jumpin' back at him,
knowin' that he was just venting.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.836
There's venting,
and there's breaking balls.

06:59.919 --> 07:03.714
This is about the Suarez case
that he thinks I got him to reopen.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.216
That case your wife worked?

07:05.341 --> 07:07.927
Him takin' that second look
was his choice, Dornan.

07:08.052 --> 07:11.514
I asked him, yes.
But did he not turn me down once?

07:11.639 --> 07:14.434
-And was I ready to let it sit?
-DANNY: Was that how it went?

07:14.684 --> 07:18.938
He turns me down, not trustin'
on the basis I passed some... some remark

07:19.021 --> 07:21.941
to a panhandler seven years before,

07:22.150 --> 07:25.611
was he collecting
for the United Negro Pizza Fund?

07:25.695 --> 07:29.073
Fine. Fine.
Beautiful, let's leave it right there.

07:29.157 --> 07:32.201
-That's how you answered Dornan?
-That's exactly how I answered Dornan,

07:32.285 --> 07:35.580
an attitude to that effect.
Off his own conscience,

07:35.913 --> 07:39.417
several weeks later,
Dornan comes back to me

07:39.500 --> 07:43.921
that he'd reconsidered,
maybe Suarez was a fall guy, huh?

07:44.714 --> 07:49.385
Any risks, with the job that
that guy took of reopenin' a cleared case,

07:49.635 --> 07:52.930
those are on him, pal! Those are on him!

(CLEARS THROAT) Yeah,
I did do Martens of IAB a solid, Andy.

08:10.031 --> 08:14.327
It had to be IAB that looked at Dornan.
Martens, that you did a solid for,

08:14.410 --> 08:16.412
he could tell you
why Dornan got demoted.

08:16.537 --> 08:18.456
Well, shall I call Martens this minute?

-But not if she's been arrested.

-You're the one that called?

I'm Diane Russell. You're Elvie's mother?

I ain't having no part
of her being arrested.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.036
No. Uh... She's not arrested.

10:20.119 --> 10:23.205
So, if she was arrested, how come
she wouldn't have called me herself?

10:23.331 --> 10:26.167

-Mrs. Iglesias...

11:02.161 --> 11:05.373

a 5,000-dollar term insurance

after putting her out of your place?

12:22.533 --> 12:26.579
I put her to a wayward juvenile home
because she was selling herself.

until she disappeared.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.656
or she sold my ID to someone else.

15:58.457 --> 16:03.128
That's Joanie. (SMACKS LIPS)
And this is Jimmy Chavez did this to her.

16:03.545 --> 16:05.798
Been beating Joanie
trying to intimidate her.

16:05.881 --> 16:08.842
-Why?
-ELVIE: So she'd let him peddle her stuff.

16:09.134 --> 16:13.180
Jimmy is the half-ass, wannabe pimp
and a no-good prick that killed Joanie.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.933
Prolly. I'll tell you where to look.

16:16.183 --> 16:18.727
Why would your mother tell us
this was you?

16:19.353 --> 16:21.105
Wishful thinking.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.250
One time I was tryin' to get
this perp back to his place...

16:42.668 --> 16:44.795
"What, you ain't got
no daytime phone number for him?"

16:45.421 --> 16:47.631
"Well, I’m his neighbor,
and I gotta get in touch with him."

16:47.798 --> 16:51.135
"Oh... oh, so you got the number,
but you don't trust me with it."

16:51.468 --> 16:53.262
"All right, All right.
Well, if you his friend,

16:53.429 --> 16:55.681
"you better call, tell him
to check on his place,

16:55.848 --> 16:58.308
'cause I hear somebody
breakin' in that bad boy."

17:00.060 --> 17:02.062
(CHUCKLES) That brought him back.

17:03.939 --> 17:05.858
Where'd you learn to talk like that?

17:07.818 --> 17:10.779
-At my father's knee.
-I thought you had money.

17:10.988 --> 17:14.575
My mother worked at the post office.
My father mostly hung out drinkin'.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.535
How'd you get an education?

17:18.120 --> 17:20.956

My mother always talked up education.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.625
That's right. Same as mine.

17:25.085 --> 17:27.880
I guess she put it in my head,
that's what I wanted.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.008
Took me seven years to get my BA.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.594
Working as a uniform cop,

17:33.677 --> 17:36.472
livin' in fear if I quit night school,
she'd go upside my head.

17:39.475 --> 17:43.312
Senior year in high school, I used to hire
a kid to write my English papers for me.

to the station house. Um...

19:26.039 --> 19:27.875
Henry, you sure this isn't something

19:27.958 --> 19:30.669
you'd be as comfortable dropping

19:31.044 --> 19:35.257
Okay. Mm-hmm.

that building Bobby got left?

19:42.389 --> 19:43.432
He wants to see you?

19:43.557 --> 19:46.643
He has some documents
relating to Bobby's birds.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.770
I mean, Bobby did leave him his birds.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.565
That Henry didn't strike me
as the pigeon-flying type.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.442
Bobby kinda liked him.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.445
He always made me think of Woody Allen.

-Uh... Who are you looking for?

Jimmy Chavez.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.461
Why don't you come in and have a seat?

20:15.047 --> 20:17.382
Is it truthful about the auto accident?

20:18.800 --> 20:20.844

to talk to him for?

20:21.094 --> 20:22.930
Do you know where Jimmy is, Mrs. Chavez?

20:23.013 --> 20:26.516
Because once it was a message
if he was injured in a...

20:26.600 --> 20:30.145
a subway accident, but then
when he comes in, it wasn't about that.

20:30.395 --> 20:34.107
He was arrested for a beating he did
and a... and a robbery he did.

-Jimmy went to school with her.

21:10.227 --> 21:15.023

for Jimmy to catch chicken pox.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.985

21:18.110 --> 21:21.738

I mean, how does a guy
come through the door

22:20.797 --> 22:23.592
in a supposedly secure building
and start throwing shots?

22:23.800 --> 22:27.220

Anyway, I hope you don't feel like
I got you out there in harm's way.

29:49.871 --> 29:52.040
Last I looked, I was over 21.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.711
Over 21, pretending you're free and white.

30:00.131 --> 30:02.467
I'm not helping with the execution,
Dornan.

30:02.967 --> 30:06.262
Finish the job you're doin' on yourself
somewhere else.

30:12.393 --> 30:13.478
Yeah.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.316
(EXHALES) Yeah, okay.

(DOOR CLOSING)

30:35.708 --> 30:36.751
(SIGHS)

30:39.629 --> 30:41.631
Yeah. Good workin' with you, Dornan.

30:43.258 --> 30:47.053
Just walk around blamin' other people
for your own miserable shortcomings.

30:47.178 --> 30:50.640
Sipowicz, turn around and be glad
I’d rather drink than beat your balls off.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.725
With me, it was never either-or.

30:53.601 --> 30:55.728
If that's what you want,
let's take it outside.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.355
If that's what I want,
I'll do it right here.

30:57.438 --> 30:58.898
Yeah, right here in the house.

30:58.982 --> 31:01.109
'Cause it's less a fight with me
you're lookin' for

31:01.192 --> 31:02.902
than what that'll get you from the job.

31:03.069 --> 31:04.821
You already got me
in all the job trouble I need.

31:04.904 --> 31:07.115
If that was true, Dornan,
I would take an ass-kickin'

31:07.198 --> 31:10.201
just to make myself feel better,
but I have come to find out it's not.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.412
-No, huh?
-The job did not hurt you

31:12.495 --> 31:14.122
for reopening the Suarez case.

31:14.205 --> 31:16.499
Just my turn to be
Black man in the basket.

31:16.666 --> 31:17.750
That's why they hurt you.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.044
That chip on your shoulder
you're carryin' around.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.921
Of course, if I was white,
that'd be dignity.

31:22.005 --> 31:24.674
Big, blinkin' sign.
"This way to Dornan's chip."

31:24.757 --> 31:27.302

without Dornan's chip enterin' in."

know they can't carry your jockstrap.

31:45.612 --> 31:47.363
They're glad because they know
what I thought of them.

to spite assholes like that?

32:00.126 --> 32:02.629

for reaching out on Suarez.

32:03.588 --> 32:06.174
-Thanks.
-Don't thank me for tellin' the truth.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.885
I only did it because it was right.

32:11.512 --> 32:13.389
It's been good enough for 26 years.

32:17.101 --> 32:19.145

33:07.652 --> 33:09.529

-Home.

33:10.822 --> 33:14.325
You gonna let Graham be the only boss
standin' next to those gun crates

33:14.409 --> 33:16.869
-when they have that press conference?
-You're damn straight.

33:17.036 --> 33:18.454
I'm ashamed we're both bosses.

33:18.579 --> 33:20.289
I'd be ashamed
to be standing there next to him.

33:20.373 --> 33:23.960
You are gonna let Graham
take the boss's credit by himself

33:24.043 --> 33:26.879

some bigger boss sat you down?

to let you out tomorrow.

-We're leavin'?

Him.

Andy, it wouldn't hurt us gettin'
a little ink

34:09.839 --> 34:11.424
off recovering those crated weapons.

34:11.507 --> 34:13.593
-Then you stay here, Martinez.
-JAMES: No. God forbid

see me doin' good in the news.

34:15.803 --> 34:18.806
-Your boss authorize your leaving?
-He wasn't around to ask.

34:19.182 --> 34:21.851
You leave me to stand alone
at that press conference,

34:21.976 --> 34:23.561

the statement I issue.

34:23.644 --> 34:25.521
Yeah. I read those statements verbatim.

34:25.688 --> 34:27.648
How about standing at a mic
in someone else's house

34:27.732 --> 34:29.442
without even
your own detective next to you?

34:29.609 --> 34:31.819
What kind of statement does that make,
boss?

34:33.029 --> 34:35.698
-Fancy wanted us to do this?
-(SIGHS) No.

34:35.823 --> 34:37.283

they got the market cornered.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.162

34:52.673 --> 34:55.384
Graham. Cancel the press conference.

I'm no good at letters.

No, I understand.

36:01.659 --> 36:04.912
A... as far as the building, uh,
that's goin' okay.

36:05.371 --> 36:06.455
DIANE: Good.

36:06.706 --> 36:10.710
I hope you're not pissed off on that,
him leaving the building in my care.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.254
No. No, I'm... I'm just as glad he did.

36:13.379 --> 36:18.134
Uh... I wanted to update you on the birds,
which he left to me to complicate my life.

36:18.342 --> 36:20.219
Th... there's a list.

36:21.387 --> 36:23.431
That's alphabetized by names

36:23.514 --> 36:25.850
and cross-referenced
to the leg-band numbers.

36:26.100 --> 36:29.020
-I didn't know they had names.
-Well, I gave 'em names.

36:29.979 --> 36:33.858
I got tired of calling out, uh, "118 NPA."

36:33.983 --> 36:38.196
-Bobby used to just say, "him" or "her."
-Well, I gave 'em names.

36:39.447 --> 36:41.240
Sure. That... that's good.

36:41.824 --> 36:44.160
Or, uh, "that one."

36:45.077 --> 36:46.120
He'd say.

36:48.289 --> 36:52.084
-DIANE: Hmm. This looks really thorough.
-HENRY: I... I don't know if you're aware,

36:52.168 --> 36:55.796
-he instructed me to take 'em upstate.
-DIANE: So, they could fly back home?

36:55.880 --> 36:58.341
HENRY: H... he sent me on a jaunt
to New Paltz.

36:58.674 --> 37:01.636
His, uh, goodbye instructions.

37:01.886 --> 37:05.056
I only assume he didn't realize
I'd never been out of the city.

37:06.390 --> 37:10.353
An... anyway, that went okay.
I actually met an old biddy up there

37:10.436 --> 37:12.521
who's coming down next month
for the stamp show.

37:13.022 --> 37:16.275
-Good.
-She runs the, uh, bed-and-breakfast

37:16.442 --> 37:18.694
I stayed at. A dump, that place.

37:20.029 --> 37:22.990
A... Anyway, his letter, uh, said...

37:24.075 --> 37:25.868
k... keep you posted on the birds.

37:27.119 --> 37:28.120
Thanks, Henry.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.419
express my sympathy.

37:41.008 --> 37:44.470
me keep you posted.
Did he, uh, have more...

Okay. Um... so long.

-Did you want this?
-Uh... No. Keep it. I got it on disk.

38:17.336 --> 38:18.337
Is it official yet?

38:18.421 --> 38:20.589
You mean,
your daughter Elvie's being dead?

38:20.715 --> 38:23.467
I notified the insurance
just to get the wheels rolling.

38:23.676 --> 38:26.095
Well, now you have to notify 'em
your daughter's still alive.

38:26.762 --> 38:28.764
-What?
-I guess you not seeing her all this time,

38:28.848 --> 38:30.766
-you forgot what she looked like.

-I was sure it was her.
-(GRUNTS) That's crap.

38:53.247 --> 38:56.167
-I was filled with grief.
-You filed a false police report

38:56.250 --> 38:58.919
-with intent to commit fraud.
-I was the beneficiary

38:59.003 --> 39:00.254
to that christening insurance.

and then it turns out different.

39:26.781 --> 39:31.035

but it was all a big mistake."

-Like Sally Jesse or whatnot.

39:38.834 --> 39:40.378
"then will you come on too?"

"They made a mistake that broke my heart,
but what a relief came after."

and she come on, too."

to stay in touch on, um, how the birds are

40:28.300 --> 40:29.677

42:23.791 --> 42:25.167

-Hey, boss.
-Hey, Danny.

-So, why didn't you go?
-Dornan split, you split.

I didn't mean to bring up
unhappy memories, Andy.

43:21.599 --> 43:22.891
No, I understand.

43:25.019 --> 43:27.479
Andy lost his grown son
in a street shooting.

43:35.070 --> 43:36.238
I'm sorry.
