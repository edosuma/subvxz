WEBVTT

00:14.765 --> 00:17.435
Thank you.

00:17.435 --> 00:19.812
How's the evening so far, sir?

00:19.812 --> 00:21.647
Very good.
Having a nice meal.

00:22.982 --> 00:25.276
How many clues have you solved?

00:25.276 --> 00:26.736
What's that?

00:26.736 --> 00:28.863
The clues.

00:28.863 --> 00:32.658
To the hidden treasure.
How many have you solved?

00:32.658 --> 00:35.035
I think you have
the wrong person.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.455
I know exactly who you are,
Mr. Browning,

00:37.455 --> 00:41.709
and as you are the executor
of Warren Bostwick's estate,

00:41.709 --> 00:43.794
I know what
you have access to.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.546
How many clues have you solved?

00:46.046 --> 00:47.590
Excuse me.

00:49.425 --> 00:51.886
How. Many. Clues.

00:52.470 --> 00:54.013
None. I swear.

00:54.013 --> 00:56.390
I-I wasn't allowed in the room
when the will was read!

00:56.390 --> 00:59.185
I-I tried to listen,
but I didn't hear anything!

00:59.185 --> 01:00.853
Argh!

01:02.271 --> 01:03.397
I believe you.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.673
- Harold.
- Excuse me.

01:29.673 --> 01:32.551
Why are you in my home
at this hour?

01:32.551 --> 01:33.928
This is not okay.

01:33.928 --> 01:36.639
You're right. It's not.
I understand that.

01:36.639 --> 01:38.891
And under
any other circumstances,

01:38.891 --> 01:40.267
I wouldn't have imposed.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.019
Did you sleep here?

01:42.019 --> 01:43.979
A <i>very</i> quick catnap.

01:43.979 --> 01:45.773
Just on the bench
over there.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.566
Truly,
a half-hour at most,

01:47.566 --> 01:50.444
and then the time it took
to put together breakfast.

01:50.444 --> 01:54.615
You see, I was at Mount Vernon,
playing a very small part

01:54.615 --> 01:56.867
in a Revolutionary War reenactment,

01:57.034 --> 01:58.786
when I got to drinking
quite late

01:58.786 --> 02:01.121
with the
1st Delaware Regiment.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.957
One thing led to another.

02:02.957 --> 02:06.961
Those Blue Hen boys really know
how to hold their whiskey.

02:06.961 --> 02:09.672
What is going on with you?
Do you even have a home anymore?

02:09.672 --> 02:13.050
Please. Sit down, Harold.
Have some coffee.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.969
We've got business
to discuss.

02:14.969 --> 02:16.679
Like Robert Vesco?

02:16.679 --> 02:18.722
Tell me that wasn't you
that broke him out of prison.

02:18.722 --> 02:21.642
I read he escaped
from a hospital.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.352
Just as well.

02:23.352 --> 02:25.479
Prison's no place
for a man

02:25.479 --> 02:28.691
of Robert Vesco's stature
or advanced age.

02:28.691 --> 02:31.318
You realize that we have
to track him down now and arrest him.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.988
Well, you could do that,
but you'll be leaving

02:33.988 --> 02:37.408
three young women
in mortal danger.

02:37.408 --> 02:39.869
The Hyena
is on the hunt.

02:39.869 --> 02:41.203
A Blacklister?

02:41.203 --> 02:43.038
Of the lowest order.

02:43.038 --> 02:46.458
Are you familiar
with Warren Bostwick?

02:47.042 --> 02:50.129
New York hedge-fund titan.
Died a couple years back.

02:50.129 --> 02:51.672
They say they never recovered his fortune.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.842
Ah. Last week, Bostwick's attorney

02:54.842 --> 02:58.137
was found dead in the
men's room at Benneker's.

02:58.137 --> 03:00.681
What looked like
a slip and fall

03:00.681 --> 03:03.392
was really the work
of the Hyena.

03:03.392 --> 03:06.687
When professional thieves
or white-collar criminals

03:06.687 --> 03:08.063
are imprisoned,

03:08.063 --> 03:10.524
their stolen goods
are rarely recovered.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.692
Do you know why?

03:11.692 --> 03:13.110
They're too well-hidden.

03:13.319 --> 03:14.987
Waiting for the felon's
jail sentence to end

03:14.987 --> 03:16.238
so they can be reclaimed.

03:16.238 --> 03:19.491
And that's when
the Hyena strikes.

03:19.491 --> 03:23.704
A scavenger by nature,
he sniffs out the hidden spoils

03:23.954 --> 03:27.750
by shaking down family members
and associates,

03:27.750 --> 03:29.251
torturing them,
murdering them.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.003
Warren Bostwick
may have played it

03:31.003 --> 03:33.380
fast and loose in the market,
but he was not a criminal.

03:33.380 --> 03:36.634
No, but old Warren
did leave behind a hidden fortune

03:36.634 --> 03:38.761
worth hundreds
of millions,

03:38.761 --> 03:41.305
and the Hyena
has caught the scent.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.183
His real name
is Sean Bane.

03:44.183 --> 03:46.727
He uses extreme violence
to hunt down what he's looking for,

03:46.727 --> 03:50.314
and right now he's hunting
the lost fortune of this man.

03:50.314 --> 03:51.941
One week
before his death,

03:51.941 --> 03:54.610
Warren Bostwick
liquidated his portfolio

03:54.610 --> 03:58.447
and transferred his massive wealth
into an unknown account.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.908
To date, those funds
haven't been recovered.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.993
Bane is deviating
from his usual MO

04:02.993 --> 04:05.204
by targeting
an innocent man's fortune.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.748
Last week, he killed
Bostwick's attorney.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.333
His next logical target

04:09.333 --> 04:11.961
would be Bostwick's
three surviving daughters.

04:11.961 --> 04:13.045
Triplets?

04:13.045 --> 04:15.464
Yes,
and protecting them won't be easy.

04:15.464 --> 04:19.009
Cordelia's in a remote village
in Bolivia doing relief work,

04:19.009 --> 04:21.095
Alex went off the grid
eight months ago,

04:21.095 --> 04:23.305
and Kendall's the only one
we have a location on.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.641
She was CFO of
her father's company until his death.

04:25.641 --> 04:27.810
She's now living in
his Westchester mansion.

04:27.810 --> 04:30.896
Sorry, but Wujing is amassing
Blacklisters as we speak

04:30.896 --> 04:33.107
to take down Reddington.
I mean, why would he divert us

04:33.107 --> 04:34.733
to babysit
a bunch of rich women?

04:34.733 --> 04:36.902
It doesn't matter. They're in danger.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.487
Ressler, Dembe, meet with Kendall.

04:38.487 --> 04:41.907
Agent Malik, I want you to reach out
to some of your international contacts,

04:41.907 --> 04:44.493
see if you can track down
the other two sisters.

04:46.328 --> 04:48.706
Hello, Robert.

04:48.706 --> 04:50.290
Mmm-hmm?

04:50.290 --> 04:51.667
Comfy?

04:51.667 --> 04:55.504
Hmm! I'm limper than
a drunk jellyfish.

04:55.504 --> 04:57.339
Ooh.

04:57.339 --> 04:59.842
I haven't had
a Turkish massage like that

04:59.842 --> 05:01.802
since that hammam in Antalya.

05:01.802 --> 05:05.139
Well, after a year in lockup,
you deserve it.

05:05.139 --> 05:07.349
Lunch from Mama's TOO!
will be here within the hour.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.977
Hmm. Raymond...

05:09.977 --> 05:11.937
I love the hospitality here,

05:11.937 --> 05:16.358
but I feel like I'm being
fattened up for a slaughter.

05:16.358 --> 05:18.068
When does the axe fall?

05:18.068 --> 05:19.570
There's no axe.

05:19.570 --> 05:20.821
Hmm.

05:22.573 --> 05:23.949
So, what gives?

05:23.949 --> 05:25.868
First you bust me out of prison.

05:25.868 --> 05:29.580
Now you're treating me
like a hairy princess.

05:29.580 --> 05:32.041
I've lost a lot of people, Robert.

05:32.041 --> 05:36.879
If my circle of friends gets any smaller,
it won't be a circle.

05:36.879 --> 05:41.216
I just want to fill my world
with people I care about.

05:43.135 --> 05:44.386
What a crock of crap.

05:46.430 --> 05:48.849
You need me for a job or what?

05:49.391 --> 05:51.185
I need you for a job.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.272
Don Browning didn't
trip and fall in that bathroom.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.899
Your father's attorney was murdered.

05:56.899 --> 05:58.609
We have strong reason
to believe

05:58.609 --> 06:00.819
there's a violent criminal
chasing his fortune,

06:00.819 --> 06:03.197
which puts you and your sisters
in danger.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.657
Forgive me, gentlemen,
but you're beginning

06:05.657 --> 06:07.284
to sound like the conspiracy nuts.

06:07.284 --> 06:08.911
I mean, there are entire subreddits

06:08.911 --> 06:10.746
devoted to the mystery
of why Warren Bostwick

06:10.746 --> 06:12.247
liquidated all of his holdings.

06:12.247 --> 06:13.999
And what can you tell us about that?

06:14.833 --> 06:16.627
How about I let my father
tell you?

06:17.795 --> 06:20.380
<i>In my dwindling days
here on Earth,</i>

06:20.380 --> 06:23.133
<i>I've made a bleak discovery.</i>

06:23.133 --> 06:27.137
<i>I may be a market genius,
but I'm a lousy parent.</i>

06:27.137 --> 06:29.306
<i>My three adult daughters</i>

06:29.306 --> 06:33.310
<i>are just waiting for me to die
so they can cash out.</i>

06:33.310 --> 06:36.647
<i>I can feel that
every time you visit me.</i>

06:36.647 --> 06:38.690
<i>You three are strangers
to me,</i>

06:38.899 --> 06:40.984
<i>and barely sisters
to each other.</i>

06:41.151 --> 06:43.278
<i>That's why
I'm leaving this video,</i>

06:43.278 --> 06:47.866
<i>in hopes that I may do in death
what I failed to do in life,</i>

06:47.866 --> 06:52.830
<i>teach you to work hard
and to work together.</i>

06:52.830 --> 06:55.958
<i>It's the only way
you'll ever see my money.</i>

06:56.166 --> 06:59.628
As part of his effort
to make them earn their inheritance,

06:59.628 --> 07:03.465
old Warren consolidated
his assets into Bitcoin.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.050
Some financial wizard.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.301
He took a bath there, huh?

07:06.301 --> 07:07.678
On the contrary.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.471
Even after
the market crash,

07:09.471 --> 07:12.432
Warren's fortune has doubled
since his death.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.268
But more importantly,

07:14.268 --> 07:17.604
all his crypto funds
are stored in one location.

07:17.604 --> 07:20.357
<i>An anonymous
digital wallet.</i>

07:20.357 --> 07:22.401
<i>I've created a passcode
for that wallet,</i>

07:22.401 --> 07:24.903
<i>which I've split
into three pieces.</i>

07:24.903 --> 07:26.363
<i>At the end of this message,</i>

07:26.363 --> 07:29.032
<i>I'm going to read you
a poem I wrote.</i>

07:29.032 --> 07:30.659
The poem
is a treasure map,

07:30.659 --> 07:32.703
its lines filled
with hidden clues

07:32.703 --> 07:34.997
drawn from
his personal life.

07:34.997 --> 07:37.916
<i>Solve the clues
to reveal the passcodes</i>

07:37.916 --> 07:41.420
<i>and access ungodly riches.</i>

07:43.755 --> 07:46.383
Have the three of you been able
to solve any of the clues together?

07:46.383 --> 07:48.844
Together
was never an option.

07:48.844 --> 07:51.555
No, I mean, I love my sisters,
but they're free spirits.

07:51.555 --> 07:53.473
They don't know how
to hold onto money.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.851
But when I find the funds,
I'll provide for them.

07:55.851 --> 07:57.561
As the eldest sister, it's my job.

07:58.020 --> 07:59.813
Wait. The eldest? You're triplets.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.398
And I'm the eldest by 12 minutes.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.066
Who knows
about the existence

08:03.066 --> 08:04.818
of the clues
and the hidden passcodes?

08:04.818 --> 08:06.987
As far as I know,
now that Don Browning is dead,

08:06.987 --> 08:08.488
just myself and my sisters.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.115
Can we get a copy of the poem?

08:10.115 --> 08:12.910
Why? So you can become
weekend treasure hunters?

08:13.744 --> 08:15.746
I'm sorry, but I need to
get back to work, agents.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.998
Thank you for warning me of the danger.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.209
Sorry, but we've been
authorized to provide you

08:20.209 --> 08:21.585
with a full-time FBI detail.

08:21.585 --> 08:25.005
And I appreciate that offer, I do,
but I'm sure my security team

08:25.005 --> 08:27.466
can handle any threats
that find their way here.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.301
Thank you.

08:29.301 --> 08:33.639
For two years, Warren's own daughters
haven't figured it out.

08:33.639 --> 08:35.307
What makes you think <i>we</i> can?

08:35.307 --> 08:40.562
Well, we're men
of a certain age who tippled with Warren

08:40.562 --> 08:43.232
on many a balmy night in Mustique.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.942
Robert, I'd venture to say

08:44.942 --> 08:48.403
that you and I know far more details

08:48.403 --> 08:52.074
of Warren's personal life
than even his own daughters.

08:52.074 --> 08:54.826
Well, what the hell?
The girls had their chance.

08:54.826 --> 08:57.246
Shall I read the first stanza
of the poem?

08:57.246 --> 08:58.372
You have it?

08:59.748 --> 09:02.251
"To find the answer that you seek

09:02.251 --> 09:04.586
you'll need to sit with Hemingway.

09:04.586 --> 09:07.422
To Have or Have Not your desire.

09:07.422 --> 09:11.635
Just stay until the sun's last ray."

09:11.635 --> 09:13.303
How did you get ahold of that?

09:13.303 --> 09:15.180
"To Have or Have Not."

09:15.180 --> 09:18.267
Warren's daughter Kendall
secretly paid a cryptanalyst

09:18.267 --> 09:20.936
to comb thorough
the entire boo for hidden cyphers.

09:20.936 --> 09:23.272
That's how this whole affair
came to my attention.

09:23.272 --> 09:27.109
The cryptanalyst is one of
my better-paid resources.

09:27.109 --> 09:29.236
Oh. Hemingway.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.072
Warren always struck me
as more of a Faulkner guy.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.116
You were struck correctly.

09:34.116 --> 09:37.286
I once heard Warren
call Hemingway "a drunk Neanderthal

09:37.286 --> 09:39.246
who couldn't string
six words together."

09:39.246 --> 09:41.915
So he hated Hemingway.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.544
But he loved his
Arturo Fuente Hemingway cigars.

09:45.544 --> 09:48.672
Ooh. Hand-rolled in the Dominican.

09:48.672 --> 09:51.758
Always kept a box
in the humidor in his study.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.052
Robert, did you just solve a clue?

09:56.054 --> 09:58.849
Well, maybe half a clue.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.685
To figure out the rest,
we need to find a way into Warren's study.

10:10.652 --> 10:12.279
FBI. For Miss Bostwick.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.989
Go up and see her
if you want.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.534
Miss Bostwick told you.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.828
She doesn't require

10:19.828 --> 10:21.955
any FBI protect--

10:36.428 --> 10:38.221
Good evening, Miss Bostwick.

10:38.221 --> 10:40.974
It's time you and I had a friendly chat.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.109
I arrived at 7:00 a.m.
for my shift,

10:51.276 --> 10:52.861
and her body was cold
when I found it hanging here,

10:52.861 --> 10:54.363
and I called you
straight away.

10:54.363 --> 10:55.864
Was there a night guard here?

10:55.864 --> 10:57.824
Jimmy. He's always here
when I check in,

10:57.824 --> 10:59.326
but this morning,
there was no sign of him.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.286
I guess Kendall sent him out
so she could, uh--

11:01.286 --> 11:03.330
Look, why don't you write down
his cellphone number

11:03.330 --> 11:04.623
and address for me, huh?

11:04.623 --> 11:05.832
All right.

11:07.834 --> 11:11.338
M.E. says he can't determine
a cause of death until after the autopsy.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.256
Don't need an M.E.
to tell me what happened here.

11:13.256 --> 11:14.591
This wasn't a suicide.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.551
The Hyena is working his way
through the sisters.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.303
Yeah, well, we need
to find the other two,

11:18.303 --> 11:20.055
and their protection's a priority now.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.182
Malik's reaching out
to the relief organization

11:22.182 --> 11:24.309
that Cordelia works for.
They're getting word to her.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.311
What about Alex?
The one who's off the grid?

11:26.311 --> 11:29.064
- We have any info on her?
- I know where Alex lives.

11:29.231 --> 11:31.691
I've driven Kendall to
her building in Hoboken lots of times.

11:44.121 --> 11:46.373
A rich Bostwick
daughter lives here?

11:46.373 --> 11:50.794
Urban off-the-grid living. It's a thing.

11:50.794 --> 11:53.797
Well, if she's here,
she knows we're here.

11:57.008 --> 11:59.010
- <i>Who are you?</i>
- Alex Bostwick?

11:59.010 --> 12:00.429
<i>I said, who are you?</i>

12:00.429 --> 12:03.557
Agent Ressler, FBI.
This is Agent Zuma.

12:03.557 --> 12:06.643
We need to speak to you
about your sister Kendall.

12:11.148 --> 12:12.524
They got to Kendall?

12:14.276 --> 12:16.403
Her body was found hanging in the study.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.780
We have cause to believe
she was murdered.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.449
I'm sorry.

12:20.449 --> 12:22.200
You said "they."
Who are "they"?

12:22.200 --> 12:24.327
I don't know! I don't know!

12:24.327 --> 12:26.538
They... I mean,
I'm trying to find them, too.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.373
They hide in
the Internet of Things.

12:28.373 --> 12:31.251
It's my father's fortune
that they want, so they hunt me down.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.670
Just buzzing bugs in the machine

12:33.670 --> 12:35.755
and in my mics,
my webcams, my brain.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.049
I thought...
I thought Siri was my friend,

12:38.049 --> 12:40.552
but, no, I mean,
wherever I go, they find me,

12:40.552 --> 12:42.971
and now, what, they got...
They got to Kendall.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.848
We don't want to cause you alarm,

12:44.848 --> 12:47.017
but the man
who got to your sister,

12:47.017 --> 12:48.518
he's coming
after you, too.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.395
We want to offer you
some protection.

12:50.395 --> 12:51.897
Can we come inside?

12:51.897 --> 12:53.356
Oh...

12:53.356 --> 12:55.609
I'm sure you'd love
to come inside

12:55.609 --> 12:57.027
and find out
what I know, huh?

12:57.027 --> 12:59.821
You... You are just like them.
Or maybe you even are them.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.156
That's it. That's it.

13:01.156 --> 13:04.201
Oh, what the Feds
would love to do with Daddy's money.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.622
She's really not well.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.791
We need to put surveillance
on this building immediately.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.793
Whether she wants it or not.

13:19.007 --> 13:21.510
Ah. Almost there.

13:26.306 --> 13:30.018
Now, if I recall,
Warren's lair is to the right here.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.686
Yeah.

13:35.190 --> 13:36.858
Ah.

13:45.659 --> 13:46.701
Hemingways.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.328
Robert, you called it.

13:48.578 --> 13:49.788
So, now what?

13:49.955 --> 13:52.541
"To find the answer that you seek,

13:52.541 --> 13:54.709
you'll need to sit with Hemingway."

13:54.709 --> 13:56.711
Don't have to ask me twice.

13:59.965 --> 14:01.424
Mmm.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.053
Well, it's kind of batty, isn't it?

14:05.053 --> 14:08.056
I mean, sending your own kids
on a scavenger hunt

14:08.056 --> 14:09.975
to claim their inheritance.

14:11.101 --> 14:13.562
I don't know, Robert.

14:13.562 --> 14:18.567
Who's to say how one might feel
at the time of their death?

14:18.567 --> 14:22.821
Warren may have felt
amused, mischievous,

14:22.821 --> 14:24.447
or maybe just hopeful.

14:26.741 --> 14:31.871
Better that than fear or pain or regret.

14:33.623 --> 14:37.043
At the moment of my death,
I just want to feel alive.

14:40.463 --> 14:43.258
Agent Malik. Hi.
This is Cordelia Bostwick.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.552
<i>Thank you for getting
back to me, Ms. Bostwick.</i>

14:45.552 --> 14:48.471
First of all, I'm so sorry
about your sister.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.473
They told me you got
the news this morning?

14:50.473 --> 14:53.435
Yeah. It's been
a challenging day, that's for sure.

14:53.435 --> 14:56.563
But, uh, you know, this is just
gonna take some time to process.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.774
Of course, and I don't want
to make that any harder,

14:59.774 --> 15:02.986
but I need to let you know
that your safety is in jeopardy.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.447
There's a dangerous man
after you and your sister,

15:05.447 --> 15:07.032
and he will find his way to you.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.783
In... In Bolivia?

15:08.783 --> 15:10.452
He's chasing your father's money.

15:10.452 --> 15:13.121
So, you... You want me to
come to where a killer is?

15:13.121 --> 15:15.206
<i>We have no way to
keep you safe if you don't.</i>

15:15.206 --> 15:16.875
If you're here,
we can assign you

15:16.875 --> 15:20.545
a full-time protective detail
in an FBI safe house.

15:20.545 --> 15:23.423
Okay. Um, yeah, I mean, I'm...

15:23.423 --> 15:25.133
I'm planning to come back
for the funeral, anyway,

15:25.133 --> 15:28.178
so just...
Just give me the details.

15:29.471 --> 15:30.847
Hmm.

15:33.016 --> 15:36.102
Well, the Hemingway's
almost dead.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.854
I'm nubbing it here, bud.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.483
How is this supposed
to solve a clue?

15:41.483 --> 15:43.443
Trust the poem.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.112
"To Have or Have Not your desire,

15:46.112 --> 15:49.240
just stay until the sun's last ray."

15:49.240 --> 15:51.993
- It's still light out.
- Yeah. Barely.

15:51.993 --> 15:55.288
If we're gonna do more cigars,
I need better light to see.

15:57.082 --> 15:58.833
Ah.

16:00.877 --> 16:02.420
Raymond.

16:02.420 --> 16:05.048
Does that look like
"the sun's last ray" to you?

16:05.799 --> 16:07.175
I'll bet that's a Handel lamp.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.136
Hand-painted.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.555
Take a look under the rim.

16:14.182 --> 16:17.102
H-A-N-D-E-L.

16:17.102 --> 16:19.020
Ah.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.980
Oh, there's a model number, too.

16:21.731 --> 16:25.819
6160. W.R. What's that?

16:25.819 --> 16:28.405
That's the craftsman's initials.

16:28.571 --> 16:30.198
Oh.

16:30.198 --> 16:31.574
Put it all together...

16:31.574 --> 16:33.576
It's a hidden passcode!

16:36.538 --> 16:38.498
I'll be damned.

16:38.498 --> 16:43.253
So, you sit with the Hemingway cigar
until the sun goes down,

16:43.253 --> 16:47.799
prompting you to turn on the lamp,
revealing the hidden passcode.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.008
Not bad.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.552
Not bad?

16:50.552 --> 16:52.095
Come on. Read the next clue.

16:52.095 --> 16:53.596
I'm feeling lucky!

16:58.101 --> 16:59.436
All right.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.189
"You can't define its radiance.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.817
You love it irresistibly.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.903
So find the stone I speak of.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.740
And whisper to it softly."

17:11.740 --> 17:13.450
A radiant stone.

17:13.450 --> 17:16.369
Irresistible. Uh...

17:16.369 --> 17:17.662
Like a gemstone?

17:17.662 --> 17:19.247
No.

17:19.247 --> 17:22.792
Warren wasn't impressed
by precious gems.

17:22.792 --> 17:27.338
Terrible investments.
Too easy to lose or steal.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.468
In fact, he once told me
the only diamond he ever bought

17:31.468 --> 17:33.845
was the one he put on Marilyn's finger.

17:33.845 --> 17:34.929
Right there!

17:36.723 --> 17:41.269
And immediately after buying it,
Warren had the diamond itself

17:41.269 --> 17:44.731
laser-engraved with
a miniature code so small,

17:44.731 --> 17:46.983
it can only be seen
by microscope,

17:46.983 --> 17:50.695
so if the ring were ever stolen,
he could prove it was hers.

17:50.695 --> 17:53.031
That's vintage Warren.

17:53.531 --> 17:56.367
He engraved everything
he owned. Remember?

17:56.367 --> 17:58.787
Fountain pens. Golf clubs.

17:58.787 --> 18:01.873
Even his racehorse. Tattooed its ear.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.046
What are the chances

18:08.046 --> 18:12.509
that invisible engraving
in Marilyn's diamond ring

18:12.509 --> 18:14.886
is the next piece of the passcode?

18:15.553 --> 18:16.846
Fits the clue.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.265
But where's the stone?

18:19.265 --> 18:21.768
Marilyn died in childbirth.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.937
Hope he didn't bury it with her.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.730
He didn't. Look here.

18:30.401 --> 18:31.778
I'll be.

18:31.778 --> 18:35.073
I believe that's Alex,
the oddest duck in the brood.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.534
Warren must have
passed the ring down to her.

18:37.534 --> 18:38.618
Mmm-hmm.

18:38.910 --> 18:40.161
This young woman

18:40.161 --> 18:43.456
is wearing the answer
to our next clue.

18:44.082 --> 18:46.376
I love a diamond heist.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.344
<i>We got a hit from
one of the area motels</i>

18:56.344 --> 18:58.513
<i>where I circulated photos of Bane.</i>

18:58.513 --> 19:01.850
He checked out 40 minutes ago,
driving a white Chevy van

19:01.850 --> 19:05.228
with stolen tags,
carrying what looked like a tool belt.

19:05.228 --> 19:07.272
- Was that the only sighting?
- For the moment.

19:07.272 --> 19:08.648
We just issued a BOLO

19:08.648 --> 19:10.525
and added the plate
to the ALPR hot list.

19:10.525 --> 19:12.527
If we get an alert,
we'll let you know.

19:12.527 --> 19:14.946
I'm leaving for JFK now
to meet the third sister

19:14.946 --> 19:16.698
and escort her
to the safe house.

19:16.698 --> 19:19.033
Be careful out there. All of you.

19:19.033 --> 19:22.412
Tadashi, any luck
finding her address?

19:22.412 --> 19:24.205
Luck? No.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.457
Skill? Ya boy!

19:26.457 --> 19:28.334
Before Alex Bostwick went off the grid,

19:28.334 --> 19:30.753
she was a heavy social-media user,

19:30.753 --> 19:32.922
but last year,
she went full digital detox,

19:32.922 --> 19:34.382
with one exception.

19:34.382 --> 19:35.884
Two weeks ago,
she accidentally posted

19:35.884 --> 19:37.552
to one of her
dormant accounts.

19:37.552 --> 19:40.680
She wrote to a user
named MadIRC.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.724
I located him
in an obscure chat room,

19:42.724 --> 19:46.853
where I lurked until Alex joined
under the user name OptimisticPanda.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.688
That gave me her IP address,
and from there,

19:48.688 --> 19:50.481
it was a hop skip to her geodata.

19:50.481 --> 19:51.691
What'd he just say?

19:51.691 --> 19:53.943
We have her address.

19:53.943 --> 19:56.529
But Alex won't just
open her door for us.

19:56.529 --> 20:00.533
If we want to get inside
and find her mother's diamond ring,

20:00.533 --> 20:01.826
we need an angle.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.411
- Hmm.
- That's easy.

20:03.411 --> 20:06.080
Alex has devolved
into a conspiracy freak.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.124
Based on her discussions
in the chat room,

20:08.124 --> 20:09.584
she's convinced
that she's being monitored

20:09.584 --> 20:11.669
by ultrasonic listening devices.

20:11.669 --> 20:13.254
She's just paranoid.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.548
She's been chasing that fortune
for two years!

20:15.548 --> 20:18.760
Alex contacted MadIRC because
he claims to have invented

20:18.760 --> 20:23.181
an Exotic Modulation Detector
to sniff out ultrasonic surveillance.

20:23.932 --> 20:26.559
- Did he?
- No way!

20:27.727 --> 20:30.396
Well, whether he's invented
anything real or not,

20:30.396 --> 20:34.275
MadIRC has invented
an alter ego.

20:34.275 --> 20:38.029
Perhaps we can employ
the ingenious MadIRC

20:38.029 --> 20:39.781
for our purposes anyway.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.157
Yes.

20:41.157 --> 20:44.827
MadIRC is just an archetype
for a character,

20:44.827 --> 20:46.788
waiting for the right actor
to step inside

20:46.788 --> 20:49.332
and breathe life
into the role.

20:49.332 --> 20:52.335
You don't know anything
about ultrasonic surveillance.

20:52.335 --> 20:54.128
I have Tadashi here to coach me.

20:55.296 --> 20:56.881
We'll see.

20:56.881 --> 21:00.927
Tadashi, can you send
a private message to Alex

21:00.927 --> 21:03.930
and make it look like
it's from MadIRC?

21:03.930 --> 21:05.974
We should set up a meeting.

21:07.934 --> 21:11.688
Ugh. Yeah. I was afraid something
like this would happen. Eventually.

21:11.688 --> 21:13.439
I mean, with all that
hidden money out there,

21:13.439 --> 21:15.149
you know, it was only
a matter of time before

21:15.149 --> 21:17.735
word got out that we were
given clues to find it.

21:18.987 --> 21:20.071
What about you?

21:20.071 --> 21:21.698
Did you try finding it?

21:22.824 --> 21:25.868
Sure. I mean,
after we watched his video,

21:25.868 --> 21:28.162
I wanted the three of us
to work together.

21:28.162 --> 21:31.791
It's what my father intended
by writing that stupid poem,

21:31.791 --> 21:34.335
and I thought it would
give us the best shot at solving it.

21:34.335 --> 21:36.087
I gather that's not what happened.

21:36.087 --> 21:39.507
Oh, no. The claws came out.
Like always.

21:39.507 --> 21:41.676
Kendall tried to take control of us.

21:41.676 --> 21:45.054
I guess, I don't know. She thought
it was her role as CFO in the company.

21:45.471 --> 21:47.098
Poor Alex just started
showing strain

21:47.098 --> 21:49.851
under the pressure of it all
right away and just...

21:49.851 --> 21:52.103
Crawled into her own shell.

21:52.103 --> 21:54.063
So you walked away?

21:54.731 --> 21:56.107
That's right.

21:56.107 --> 21:58.359
My father left each of us
modest trust funds,

21:58.359 --> 22:01.070
and it was enough to get by on.

22:01.070 --> 22:03.865
But I really don't want
any part of his wealth now.

22:03.865 --> 22:05.783
I've just seen
what it does to people.

22:05.783 --> 22:08.327
Well, we've got a couple
leads on our target,

22:08.327 --> 22:11.748
so hopefully we can
get you back to your relief work soon.

22:11.748 --> 22:13.916
We're driving to
a safe house in Flatbush,

22:13.916 --> 22:17.754
where two agents will provide
full-time protection.

22:17.754 --> 22:19.672
Okay.

22:25.136 --> 22:27.638
Oh. I'm starving. What took so long?

22:27.638 --> 22:29.807
Eh, long lines, long lines.

22:33.895 --> 22:35.396
Here you go.

22:36.898 --> 22:39.984
Wait. These are French fries.
I ordered onion rings.

22:39.984 --> 22:41.611
Well, I told them onion rings.

22:41.611 --> 22:43.321
They must've made a mistake
on the order.

22:43.321 --> 22:45.198
Yeah, but you have onion rings.

22:45.198 --> 22:47.408
Yes. They got my order right.

22:49.911 --> 22:50.953
Hey.

22:50.953 --> 22:52.622
Somebody's coming.

22:57.668 --> 22:59.587
I knew it!
Reddington just gave us this case

22:59.587 --> 23:01.339
to take out the competition.

23:01.339 --> 23:03.633
I'm not standing by this time.
I'm going to arrest Vesco.

23:03.633 --> 23:05.093
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:05.093 --> 23:09.097
If the Hyena is out there right now,
watching this building,

23:09.097 --> 23:10.932
you'll just alert him to our presence.

23:10.932 --> 23:14.644
Keeping the sisters safe
is what matters.

23:17.855 --> 23:19.565
I have some bad news for you.

23:19.565 --> 23:22.443
<i>The Feds are sitting
on Alex's building.</i>

23:22.443 --> 23:24.320
<i>We have a new player in the game.</i>

23:24.320 --> 23:26.697
<i>Raymond Reddington,
the FBI's Most Wanted man,</i>

23:26.697 --> 23:28.116
<i>just walked inside.</i>

23:28.116 --> 23:31.327
Ah. Okay.
Um, excuse me, gentlemen.

23:31.327 --> 23:33.162
Yeah. How did this happen?

23:33.162 --> 23:34.539
I don't know.

23:35.248 --> 23:38.000
Okay, well, um, we only have
two parts of the passcode,

23:38.000 --> 23:39.710
so we need to find out
what Alex knows.

23:39.710 --> 23:41.671
Can you, um...
Can you get her out of there?

23:41.671 --> 23:43.047
I'll figure something out.

23:43.047 --> 23:44.632
Uh, without killing her this time?

23:44.632 --> 23:47.677
Hey! I did you a favor
by taking out Kendall.

23:47.677 --> 23:48.970
She suspected you.

23:48.970 --> 23:51.472
Just get Alex out and bring her to me.

23:58.896 --> 24:00.606
You keep Alex interested,

24:00.606 --> 24:02.525
and I'll look for
her mother's diamond ring.

24:02.525 --> 24:04.861
Hopefully it's still on Alex's finger.

24:04.861 --> 24:09.490
Have you stopped to consider
that if we find this fortune,

24:09.490 --> 24:11.826
we'll be robbing
three young ladies of their inheritance?

24:11.826 --> 24:13.744
Pish posh. I told you,

24:13.744 --> 24:16.414
Warren thought his daughters
were a disaster.

24:16.414 --> 24:17.540
Mmm.

24:17.540 --> 24:20.418
Hey. Do you remember
the password exchange?

24:20.418 --> 24:22.170
I wrote the password exchange.

24:30.178 --> 24:31.679
<i>Hello?</i>

24:31.679 --> 24:34.765
I have no mouth
and I must scream.

24:34.765 --> 24:36.893
<i>Great souls suffer in silence.</i>

24:39.687 --> 24:41.522
MadIRC. Hi. Hi.

24:41.522 --> 24:43.649
Uh, come in. Come in.

24:43.649 --> 24:44.942
Come in.

24:53.284 --> 24:55.119
Hi. Um, I'm... I'm Alex...

24:55.119 --> 24:57.330
Oh, shh, child. No birth names.

24:57.330 --> 24:58.831
It's safer that way.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.209
Ah, yes. No, yes.
You're right. Of course.

25:01.209 --> 25:03.044
Our... Our personal data
is all we have.

25:03.044 --> 25:04.837
It must be protected at all costs.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.882
Precisely why I invented the EMD.

25:07.882 --> 25:09.967
The Exotic Modulation Detector.

25:09.967 --> 25:12.887
Yeah. I know. And...
Here... Here, come in.

25:12.887 --> 25:14.931
Um, you know, I need
additional security solutions.

25:14.931 --> 25:16.557
The standard sweep tools
aren't enough.

25:16.557 --> 25:19.227
And now that they can turn
all of our technology,

25:19.227 --> 25:21.145
even our lights, into audio transmitters,

25:21.145 --> 25:22.730
it's just, nobody's safe.

25:22.730 --> 25:24.899
Slow down, OptimisticPanda.

25:24.899 --> 25:26.901
Uh, one step at a time.

25:26.901 --> 25:30.571
First, I'd like you
to meet my associate.

25:30.571 --> 25:34.575
Oh. Yes. Uh, CosmicMuffin.

25:34.575 --> 25:39.038
To determine whether my EMD
can detect emanating light fields here,

25:39.038 --> 25:43.417
CosmicMuffin needs to conduct
a search first.

25:43.417 --> 25:45.836
- Sorry. What--
- Eh, purely visual.

25:45.836 --> 25:49.131
Okay. Okay. Uh, yeah, what...
What's he looking for?

25:49.131 --> 25:52.093
Oh, any objects
that might interfere

25:52.093 --> 25:54.303
with the EMD's signal reception.

25:54.303 --> 25:57.098
- Like what?
- Certain metals. Alloys.

25:57.098 --> 25:59.767
But the worst are crystals.

25:59.767 --> 26:02.812
You can't have any crystals
with a mineral base inside your home,

26:02.812 --> 26:05.523
like rubies, emeralds, diamonds.

26:09.986 --> 26:12.071
I don't...
I don't own any gemstones.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.781
You sure about that?

26:13.781 --> 26:17.868
Most women have at least
one piece of jewelry lying around.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.954
An old necklace. A diamond ring.

26:21.205 --> 26:22.999
Yeah, I mean,
I used to own jewelry,

26:22.999 --> 26:26.252
but, yeah, I sold it all
to finance a personal project.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.129
I even had to sell
my mother's wedding ring.

26:28.129 --> 26:29.338
So no diamonds?

26:33.384 --> 26:35.344
Hello, you.

26:35.344 --> 26:37.888
Yeah, Diamond was, um,
my father's best friend,

26:37.888 --> 26:40.558
and he knew
how much I loved her.

26:40.558 --> 26:42.685
I can get a little, um,
activated sometimes,

26:42.685 --> 26:45.688
and so my shrink says
that a service animal can help.

26:45.688 --> 26:47.315
She used to say that,
but I fired her

26:47.315 --> 26:49.150
because she had something
pretty suspicious

26:49.150 --> 26:50.443
hiding in her Prada glasses.

26:51.736 --> 26:53.362
I'm just gonna finish my search.

27:03.831 --> 27:05.624
So, as I was saying,

27:05.624 --> 27:10.087
the EMD is a very special thing
because without it...

27:10.212 --> 27:12.757
We were looking for the
wrong Diamond, weren't we?

27:14.675 --> 27:16.719
Yes...

27:17.720 --> 27:20.639
Old Warren
tagged his racehorse.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.600
Why not you, too?

27:23.601 --> 27:26.645
I'm supposed to
"whisper to you softly."

27:28.939 --> 27:30.858
Look at that.

27:34.695 --> 27:37.073
<i>...entitlements are nothing more</i>

27:37.073 --> 27:40.743
<i>than socialism in action.</i>

27:40.743 --> 27:43.162
Uh, anyone want more coffee?

27:43.162 --> 27:45.956
<i>We all live in America. We all...</i>

27:45.956 --> 27:48.292
We rely on a steady flow
of coffee for this job.

27:48.292 --> 27:51.545
Yeah. I bet you do.

27:51.545 --> 27:53.672
- Thank you.
- You're welcome!

28:16.904 --> 28:19.615
Well, I'd say after
a cursory glance around

28:19.615 --> 28:21.075
that we're done here.

28:21.075 --> 28:23.452
- I've seen everything I need to see.
- Ah.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.496
Uh, okay.
What... What... What does that mean?

28:25.496 --> 28:26.997
C-Can you still sell me the EMD?

28:26.997 --> 28:29.250
I have money.
I wanted to pay you for it.

28:34.088 --> 28:35.965
There's something
I've been keeping from you.

28:35.965 --> 28:38.592
We're not the only ones
hunting this fortune.

28:38.592 --> 28:41.804
What?! You're loo...
You're looking for the money?

28:41.804 --> 28:44.056
Ugh! I cannot believe I let you in.

28:44.056 --> 28:47.309
I mean, who... Who are you?
How did you even find me?

28:47.309 --> 28:49.812
She'll be okay,
but we can't be here.

28:49.812 --> 28:51.856
- I'll meet you downstairs.
- Okay.

28:57.528 --> 28:59.947
Power's been cut. The Hyena is here.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.241
She needs protection. Hurry.

29:20.050 --> 29:22.136
Did Bane get here first?

29:22.136 --> 29:24.805
I don't believe so. Take a look at this.

29:26.056 --> 29:27.725
Looks like an old garbage chute.

29:38.652 --> 29:42.323
Your sister Cordelia told me
about your little escape route.

29:42.323 --> 29:45.618
Very eager to hear what you've
learned about the treasure.

29:51.665 --> 29:54.502
We lost Alex.
We think the Hyena has her.

29:54.502 --> 29:56.754
- Unless Reddington has her.
- Reddington?

29:56.754 --> 29:58.797
<i>Yeah, he was here,
along with Vesco, too.</i>

29:58.797 --> 30:01.300
You know those two frauds
are chasing the missing fortune, too?

30:01.300 --> 30:03.219
- <i>Sir!
- Hold on, Agent Ressler.</i>

30:03.219 --> 30:06.764
NYC DOT just got
a traffic-cam hit on Bane's white van.

30:06.764 --> 30:09.850
It's moving east on Avenue D
toward Flatbush.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.936
That's the neighborhood
where I dropped off Cordelia.

30:11.936 --> 30:13.604
It's where the safe house is.

30:13.604 --> 30:15.648
The Hyena's got one sister.
Now he's going after the other.

30:15.648 --> 30:17.441
Did you call her protective detail?

30:17.441 --> 30:19.193
Yes, and no one's answering.

30:19.193 --> 30:21.403
Agent Ressler,
you and Agent Zuma get to that safe house.

30:21.403 --> 30:22.655
I'll try and reach Reddington.

30:22.655 --> 30:23.989
Copy.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.327
You didn't think
that I might want to know

30:28.327 --> 30:31.121
that there's a homicidal maniac
on the same treasure hunt as us?

30:31.121 --> 30:32.748
I didn't want to make you anxious.

30:32.748 --> 30:34.291
Well, I'm anxious now.

30:34.291 --> 30:36.877
What about Alex?
You think she got away?

30:41.006 --> 30:42.883
I sent in reinforcements.

30:42.883 --> 30:46.554
And since when
are you worried about a mark, anyway?

30:46.554 --> 30:49.974
You've made a life of preying
on impressionable minds.

30:49.974 --> 30:52.560
Yeah, sure, when they're functional minds.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.563
But Alex, I don't know.
I mean, this poor kid.

30:55.563 --> 30:57.773
She's not dealing from a full deck.

30:57.773 --> 31:01.569
Here. Read this. The last stanza.

31:01.569 --> 31:03.404
Let's stay focused here.

31:05.990 --> 31:08.492
"Every story much reach an end.

31:08.492 --> 31:12.204
Such sadness that it doth impart.

31:12.413 --> 31:14.415
To finish mine, drop to a knee

31:14.415 --> 31:18.460
and read what's carved upon my heart."

31:18.460 --> 31:21.297
- Well, that's grim.
- Indeed.

31:21.297 --> 31:23.507
"Read what's carved upon my heart"?

31:25.175 --> 31:27.094
You don't think Warren
literally, you know...

31:27.094 --> 31:29.888
What, carved the passcode
onto his heart?

31:29.888 --> 31:32.600
Robert, please stay with me here.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.519
Though I wouldn't be survived
if one of those sisters

31:35.519 --> 31:38.272
had exhumed his body by now
to check.

31:38.272 --> 31:41.442
No, I have a feeling the true hint

31:41.442 --> 31:43.944
lies in the first half of the stanza.

31:43.944 --> 31:45.904
I'm certain of it.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.490
We need to locate Warren's grave.

31:50.534 --> 31:52.911
What is happening?
Why... Why are we here?

31:54.830 --> 31:56.665
Oh, my God.

31:58.584 --> 32:01.587
Ah. It's been a while, sis.
I'm, um...

32:01.587 --> 32:03.631
I'm really sorry we pulled you
out of your shelter.

32:03.631 --> 32:05.883
I know how safe
you feel there, but, um...

32:05.883 --> 32:09.136
Forces are
closing in around us.

32:09.136 --> 32:10.596
I need to know if you've
solved any of the clues.

32:11.972 --> 32:15.142
You?
Did you kill Kendall?

32:15.142 --> 32:16.560
That wasn't supposed to happen.

32:16.560 --> 32:19.063
- Okay, but it did.
- I tried, okay?

32:19.063 --> 32:20.856
I-I am the one who
wanted us all to work together

32:20.856 --> 32:22.691
to do this the way
that our father asked,

32:22.691 --> 32:25.069
but Kendall insisted on doing it her way,
and you just...

32:25.069 --> 32:26.904
Alex, you just crawled into a hole.

32:26.904 --> 32:28.989
Okay, well, now
we're doing it my way.

32:28.989 --> 32:31.283
You'll want to leave the room
in this next part.

32:33.327 --> 32:35.663
Okay.

32:36.330 --> 32:38.999
Well, if you want it so badly
that you'd kill Kendall, what's the point?

32:49.802 --> 32:51.387
It was tattooed inside Diamond's ear.

32:51.387 --> 32:55.974
The stone was the dog.
Of course.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.310
"You can't define its radiance.
You love it irresistibly."

32:58.310 --> 33:00.312
That's exactly how Daddy felt
about that dumb animal.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.897
- She's not dumb.
- I know. I know, Alex.

33:01.897 --> 33:03.649
I know you love her
as much as Daddy did.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.026
And Daddy tailored
each of these clues to each one of us.

33:06.026 --> 33:07.653
I mean, our best chance
at solving the poem

33:07.653 --> 33:09.279
was for us to work together.

33:09.279 --> 33:12.574
Yeah, well, that's a little hard to do
with a dead sister.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.703
We're done here, right?
We have all three clues.

33:16.036 --> 33:17.538
Time to cash out.

33:17.538 --> 33:19.456
No. No, no, no.
Not yet.

33:19.456 --> 33:21.583
If Raymond Reddington
is as much of a threat as you say he is,

33:21.583 --> 33:24.002
then I need to destroy the answer
to the third clue before he finds it.

33:26.296 --> 33:28.882
Oh, and, um, you know...

33:28.882 --> 33:31.885
I'm, uh, coming around
to what you said about Kendall.

33:31.885 --> 33:35.305
We just... We really can't afford
to leave any witnesses behind.

33:35.305 --> 33:37.683
Cordelia. Don't. Cordelia.

33:54.324 --> 33:56.285
Which, uh...
Which one of you is Reddington?

33:56.285 --> 33:57.494
- He is.
- He is.

33:57.494 --> 33:58.912
It doesn't matter.

33:58.912 --> 34:00.247
You're too late.

34:00.247 --> 34:02.416
I destroyed the answer
to the third clue.

34:02.416 --> 34:06.795
It would appear you and the Hyena
make quite a formidable pair.

34:06.795 --> 34:09.006
You know he's still
going to kill you, right?

34:09.006 --> 34:12.301
The moment you withdraw
those funds.

34:12.301 --> 34:14.219
I wouldn't count on that.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.235
He's still alive.

34:30.736 --> 34:32.237
But Bane's not.

34:34.490 --> 34:36.366
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

34:40.871 --> 34:43.123
Where's your sister?
I-I don't know. She...

34:43.123 --> 34:45.751
She told me to wait here
until she gets back.

34:45.751 --> 34:48.295
She says we're gonna be
a family again.

34:53.217 --> 34:55.469
You, uh, figured it out, huh?

34:55.469 --> 34:58.096
The epitaph on my father's grave.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.265
The final piece of the passcode.

35:01.016 --> 35:03.143
I mean, I knew the answer
because he ordered his tomb

35:03.143 --> 35:05.729
before he died
and I paid all of his bills.

35:07.856 --> 35:09.483
The final stanza said drop to a knee

35:09.483 --> 35:11.693
and "read what's carved upon my heart."

35:11.693 --> 35:14.112
This inlay on his monument
is made of rose quartz.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.739
It's one of the heart chakras.

35:18.575 --> 35:20.828
Your interpretation of the clue...

35:20.828 --> 35:22.871
A bit simplistic, don't you think?

35:22.871 --> 35:24.706
Why? What... What...
What are you talking about?

35:24.706 --> 35:28.752
You're conveniently neglecting
the first half of the stanza.

35:28.752 --> 35:31.505
"Every story must reach an end.

35:31.505 --> 35:34.883
Such sadness that it doth impart."

35:35.425 --> 35:37.553
Do you know what made
your father sad?

35:37.553 --> 35:41.181
My father was not a feeling man.

35:42.015 --> 35:43.976
On the contrary.

35:43.976 --> 35:47.521
One afternoon,
he and I were anchored off Carriacou,

35:47.646 --> 35:49.773
sitting on the bow of his yacht,

35:49.773 --> 35:53.902
when he shared with me
the key to his financial success.

35:54.778 --> 35:59.199
It was the sadness he felt
over the loss of your mother.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.326
What drove him to make

36:01.326 --> 36:04.246
all that money
you're so desperate for

36:04.246 --> 36:08.500
was a desire to dull
the pain deep inside.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.294
But all the riches in the world

36:10.294 --> 36:13.589
couldn't fill the hole that
your mother left in his life.

36:14.381 --> 36:19.052
She was his heart,
not some silly chakra.

36:20.095 --> 36:24.391
Your mother's body lies
right here beside your father,

36:24.391 --> 36:26.810
beneath a simple
grave marker,

36:26.810 --> 36:29.771
because he wasn't a wealthy man
when she passed.

36:37.487 --> 36:38.614
Ah! Look.

36:38.614 --> 36:41.241
What do you know?
There's an epitaph.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.660
The answer to your father's clue.

36:43.660 --> 36:45.078
What does it say?

36:45.078 --> 36:48.624
Ow! You shot me in the foot!

36:49.124 --> 36:51.585
We've got what we need here.
You ready to go?

36:51.585 --> 36:53.545
Hold on. We can't just leave her here

36:53.545 --> 36:55.547
- with the final piece of the puzzle.
- Don't worry.

36:55.547 --> 36:59.426
I have a cleanup crew
on standby to pick up the trash.

36:59.426 --> 37:00.677
Oh.

37:07.267 --> 37:10.020
Okay, I've strung together
the three passcodes

37:10.020 --> 37:12.981
and entered them into the login page
for Bostwick's digital wallet.

37:16.693 --> 37:19.529
Ta-da! Shi.

37:19.529 --> 37:21.156
Well done, Tadashi.

37:21.865 --> 37:23.742
That's a healthy balance.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.994
Wait. There's
something else in his wallet.

37:25.994 --> 37:27.245
It's an NFT.

37:29.206 --> 37:32.000
Non-fungible token.
This one's a video file.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.835
Is that what the kids call a TikTok?

37:33.835 --> 37:35.963
- I think that's a Chatsnap.
- Huh.

37:35.963 --> 37:38.715
Stop. I-I'm gonna open the file.

37:40.342 --> 37:42.886
<i>Congratulations, girls.</i>

37:42.886 --> 37:44.638
<i>In solving all three clues,</i>

37:44.638 --> 37:48.433
<i>you've taken a journey
into your old man's heart.</i>

37:48.433 --> 37:50.143
<i>A fine cigar.</i>

37:50.143 --> 37:51.895
<i>A faithful pet.</i>

37:51.895 --> 37:55.440
<i>And the love of a good woman.
Your mother.</i>

37:55.440 --> 37:59.820
<i>That's what sustained me
in life, even after her death.</i>

37:59.820 --> 38:04.825
<i>I'm sorry I wasn't there more
for you girls.</i>

38:05.409 --> 38:07.619
<i>It's a great failing, and I do regret it.</i>

38:08.912 --> 38:10.664
<i>But in earning your inheritance,</i>

38:10.664 --> 38:13.500
<i>you overcame your differences
and pulled together,</i>

38:13.500 --> 38:16.086
<i>just as I knew you would.</i>

38:19.673 --> 38:22.551
<i>Hopefully, if this experience
has taught you one thing,</i>

38:22.551 --> 38:24.219
<i>it's what's really important.</i>

38:25.762 --> 38:27.556
<i>The meaning of family.</i>

38:28.640 --> 38:30.976
<i>Enjoy your money, girls.</i>

38:30.976 --> 38:32.894
<i>You deserve everything you got.</i>

38:37.232 --> 38:39.401
A tragic tale, no doubt.

38:39.401 --> 38:40.861
Hmm.

38:40.861 --> 38:43.030
But at least it brought us
together, my friend.

38:43.030 --> 38:46.616
Yeah. I'm still waiting
for that axe to fall.

38:46.616 --> 38:48.702
There is no axe, Robert.

38:49.161 --> 38:51.747
Tadashi, transfer half
of Warren's cryptocurrency

38:51.872 --> 38:53.457
into Robert's account.

38:53.457 --> 38:55.709
Eh, actually, I was thinking

38:55.709 --> 38:59.921
that one-third might be more
appropriate for the situation.

38:59.921 --> 39:02.549
Why, Robert, you do have
a heartbeat after all.

39:31.078 --> 39:32.913
Do I need to buy
a blow-up mattress?

39:38.126 --> 39:40.712
I know you have questions, Harold,

39:40.712 --> 39:43.590
about jailbreaks and Robert Vesco,

39:43.590 --> 39:45.008
hidden fortunes.

39:45.008 --> 39:46.176
Fire away.

39:47.135 --> 39:50.097
Actually, no.
I don't have any questions.

39:50.097 --> 39:52.099
At this point in our relationship,

39:52.099 --> 39:56.061
after 200-some-odd Blacklisters,

39:56.061 --> 39:57.813
I'm aware of your games,

39:57.813 --> 40:00.190
and nothing you do
surprises me anymore.

40:01.483 --> 40:04.152
If that's the case,
perhaps you'll honor my request

40:04.152 --> 40:06.279
to stay away from Robert Vesco.

40:06.279 --> 40:07.531
Why's that?

40:07.531 --> 40:11.993
I can't be certain,
but I may need some... help.

40:13.703 --> 40:17.624
The sort of help
the task force cannot provide.

40:17.624 --> 40:18.834
I'll consider the request.

40:20.001 --> 40:22.879
By the way,
who walked away the winner?

40:22.879 --> 40:26.007
- What's that?
- Bostwick's riches. You and Vesco.

40:26.007 --> 40:27.759
Who screwed over who this time?

40:27.759 --> 40:30.637
Oh, that's all behind us, Harold.

40:30.637 --> 40:32.973
We've had our ups and downs,
Robert and I,

40:32.973 --> 40:34.850
but he's an old friend,

40:34.850 --> 40:39.229
and our days of betrayal
are thankfully a thing of the past.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.531
Hmm.

40:51.491 --> 40:53.034
Robert Vesco.

40:55.579 --> 40:58.915
I already placed
my annual order for Girl Scout cookies.

40:58.915 --> 41:00.792
Tell your story walking.

41:00.792 --> 41:03.461
I represent Mr. Wujing.

41:03.461 --> 41:06.381
He was given your information
by Marvin Gerard,

41:06.381 --> 41:08.967
the late attorney
for Raymond Reddington.

41:08.967 --> 41:12.053
What if I told you
your arrest by the FBI last year

41:12.053 --> 41:13.805
wasn't bad luck?

41:13.805 --> 41:15.390
It was a plan.

41:15.390 --> 41:19.436
Formulated and orchestrated
by Raymond Reddington.

41:19.436 --> 41:21.521
You walked into his trap.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.649
Why would Reddington do that?

41:27.068 --> 41:29.070
If you want to learn more,

41:29.070 --> 41:31.448
call this number when you're ready,

41:31.448 --> 41:34.201
and we'll send a car.

41:34.201 --> 41:36.578
Mr. Wujing looks forward to discussing

41:36.578 --> 41:38.705
your shared interests.
