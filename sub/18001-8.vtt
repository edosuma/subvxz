the character of Superman

04:16.464 --> 04:18.099

04:18.134 --> 04:20.103
it was taken as a
work-for-hire job,

04:20.137 --> 04:21.870
so Jerry and Joe

04:21.906 --> 04:24.871
created him and gave him away
for almost next to nothing,

04:24.905 --> 04:27.709
so Neal Adams and a lot of
other creators got together.

04:27.743 --> 04:29.678
<i>It was right before the
Superman movie came out.</i>

04:29.712 --> 04:31.947

Warner brothers into like,

"and you guys won't even give them credit?

04:38.588 --> 04:40.190

Joe's name on everything,

everything they gave the world,

05:33.354 --> 05:35.659

05:37.429 --> 05:40.263
you could get $5,000 for it

05:40.298 --> 05:42.669

05:42.703 --> 05:46.272

have all of these authenticated,

make more than $5,000.

09:42.331 --> 09:43.932
And the special today...

09:43.967 --> 09:45.934
don't want to forget about
the special of the day...

09:45.968 --> 09:47.804
<i>Ghostbusters number 16.</i>

09:47.839 --> 09:49.540
Now, I got a pretty good feeling

09:49.575 --> 09:52.310
you may be able to get it signed by, um,

09:52.344 --> 09:55.477
Mr. Ernie Hudson, who
happens to be right up there.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.646
<i>- Did you see Ghostbusters?
- Yeah.</i>

09:57.680 --> 09:59.414
You remember Winston in Ghostbusters?

10:00.582 --> 10:02.947
I think so. I'm not sure.

10:02.982 --> 10:04.048
She's not sure.

10:06.487 --> 10:08.723
<i>These guys were very into
the Ghostbusters aspect.</i>

10:08.758 --> 10:12.797
I've always viewed him
more of as warden Glen

10:12.832 --> 10:14.201
<i>from oz on hbo.</i>

10:14.235 --> 10:16.138
<i>He was the warden in oz?</i>

10:16.173 --> 10:17.408
Not only was he the warden,

10:17.442 --> 10:19.343
but he was on every single episode,

10:19.378 --> 10:21.513
and, like, solid, solid performance,

10:21.547 --> 10:23.583
which people don't remember him for.

10:23.617 --> 10:26.186
<i>They remember him for
the Ghostbusters thing.</i>

10:26.221 --> 10:28.487
<i>Naturally Ghostbusters tops the list,</i>

10:28.521 --> 10:30.657
but I also think of him as the guy from

10:30.691 --> 10:33.158
<i>the hand that rocks the
cradle, where he was awesome.</i>

10:33.192 --> 10:35.060
He had played a real character part,

10:35.094 --> 10:36.363
<i>and he was also in the crow?</i>

10:36.397 --> 10:37.597
<i>Yeah, he was in the crow.</i>

10:37.631 --> 10:39.898
He played the cop opposite Brandon Lee.

10:39.932 --> 10:41.830
Could you imagine you're in films

10:41.864 --> 10:44.028
that people are still watching today

10:44.062 --> 10:45.594
decades after they were made,

10:45.629 --> 10:47.397
<i>Ghostbusters, the hand
that rocks the cradle,</i>

10:47.431 --> 10:48.564
<i>the crow?</i>

10:48.598 --> 10:49.997
You'd be lucky to be in one movie

10:50.031 --> 10:51.431
that people remember for
the rest of their life, man,

10:51.465 --> 10:52.731
but, like, three?

10:52.766 --> 10:53.898
That's awesome.

10:53.933 --> 10:55.268
You got a customer.

10:55.303 --> 10:57.435
- Oh, hey, how you doing?
- Good, how are you?

10:57.469 --> 10:59.370
Can I please have the, uh...

10:59.404 --> 11:01.238
Cartwheel's ice cream sandwich please?

11:01.272 --> 11:03.841
You know, we uh... we
don't have any ice cream.

11:03.875 --> 11:06.776
- Oh.
- No, but what we do have...

11:06.810 --> 11:08.078
show him the menu.

11:08.112 --> 11:11.917
We have... we have comics.

11:11.952 --> 11:13.352
Comics, see?

11:13.386 --> 11:14.586
You like comics?

11:14.620 --> 11:16.223
Uh, no, not really.

11:16.257 --> 11:17.792
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

11:17.826 --> 11:19.760
<i>- Ghostbusters?
- Yeah, I'm good.</i>

11:19.794 --> 11:22.597
- No? Winston Zeddemore?
- What?

11:22.632 --> 11:25.370
<i>Winston Zeddemore?
Ghostbusters? You don't...</i>

11:25.405 --> 11:27.274
who's that?

11:27.308 --> 11:31.714
Let's go. Never mind, sorry.

11:31.749 --> 11:33.818
Hey, guys. I got some cool stuff here.

11:33.852 --> 11:35.854
Oh, I know what these
are. Wow, these are awesome.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.076
A boy wanted to know.

11:39.117 --> 11:42.915
As a guy who busted ghosts,

11:42.949 --> 11:44.853
are you a believer, Ernie?

11:44.888 --> 11:46.755
Do you believe in ghosts?

11:46.790 --> 11:48.523
Do I believe in ghosts?

11:48.557 --> 11:53.092
Well, yeah, I believe something
exists beyond what we see,

11:53.126 --> 11:54.693
you know?

11:54.727 --> 11:56.294
It's like, you know,
say there are a million

11:56.328 --> 11:59.230
different dimensions and senses,

11:59.264 --> 12:01.232
and we only have five to experience it.

12:01.266 --> 12:03.602
So if it's not in the realm of our senses,

12:03.636 --> 12:05.537
it doesn't exist as far as we're concerned,

12:05.572 --> 12:08.441
but it does, so yeah, I do.

12:08.476 --> 12:09.878
That's deep.

12:09.912 --> 12:11.481
But I don't want it
showing up in my bedroom

12:11.515 --> 12:12.715
at 3:00 in the morning.

12:12.748 --> 12:15.585
- Yeah.
- This is awesome.

12:15.620 --> 12:17.921
So yeah, no, it's cool, but,
you know, my character says,

12:17.956 --> 12:19.455
"if there's a steady paycheck in it,

12:19.489 --> 12:20.990
I'll believe anything you say,"

12:21.025 --> 12:24.530
so I got to believe we're
gonna sell some comics.

12:29.141 --> 12:29.873
[Laughs]

12:31.678 --> 12:33.211
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey, guys.

12:33.245 --> 12:36.216
- I got some cool stuff here.
- Oh, I know what these are.

12:36.250 --> 12:39.083
I heard you guys like
to take bubble baths, so...

12:39.117 --> 12:40.616
Nothing wrong with that, right?

12:40.649 --> 12:43.652
Couple guys relaxing in a bathtub.

12:43.686 --> 12:45.688
A standard-size bathtub,
three to four guys.

12:45.722 --> 12:47.124
[Laughter]

12:47.158 --> 12:50.997
These are called Soakies,
and they're from 1966.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.565
They were filled with bubble bath,

12:52.599 --> 12:55.169
so the kid could have fun in the tub

12:55.203 --> 12:57.405
and enjoy their favorite character.

13:04.779 --> 13:09.650
We have Rocket J.Squirrel,
Bullwinkle J.Moose,

13:09.684 --> 13:14.087
secret squirrel, and, of course,
the man of steel, Superman.

13:14.121 --> 13:15.323
Wow, these are awesome.

13:15.357 --> 13:17.257
Any bubble bath memories for you?

13:17.292 --> 13:19.626
Uh, some very unpleasant ones, yeah.

13:19.660 --> 13:21.429
I'd rather not get into it.

13:21.464 --> 13:22.997
Razors, Soakies.

13:23.032 --> 13:26.298
More of "floaties," they called them.

13:26.332 --> 13:29.270
[Laughter]

13:29.304 --> 13:31.171
It's like, "that's not a bath toy."

13:31.205 --> 13:32.639
Maybe not in your world.

13:32.674 --> 13:34.509
So they had these,
like, at the drugstore,

13:34.543 --> 13:36.178
and you just pick them up, and...
Yeah.

13:36.212 --> 13:38.979
Grocery store, yeah, these
were huge at one time, right?

13:39.013 --> 13:40.880
You'd open up the
head... can I open it up?

13:40.915 --> 13:42.849
Yeah, sure.

13:42.883 --> 13:45.887
Get in the bathtub, you and Superman,

13:45.922 --> 13:48.826
dump out a little bubble
bath, put the head back on,

13:48.860 --> 13:52.995
wait for the bubbles to form,
and let the action begin.

13:53.029 --> 13:54.330
They had the Beatles,

13:54.364 --> 13:57.332
and they also had the universal monsters.

13:57.366 --> 14:00.168
I mean, as a boy, I mean,
who didn't want to take a bath

14:00.203 --> 14:01.370
with the universal monsters?

14:01.404 --> 14:02.872
I mean, that would have just been...

14:02.907 --> 14:04.176
were you a big bubble bath guy?

14:04.210 --> 14:05.546
He was a big bubble bath guy.

14:05.580 --> 14:06.781
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:06.815 --> 14:08.249
Like, you know,
soaking in the tub, like...

14:08.283 --> 14:10.117
what, was it, like, seventh,
eighth grade he called my house?

14:10.151 --> 14:12.520
And my mom made the mistake of saying,

14:12.555 --> 14:14.693
"oh, Walt's busy right
now; He's taking a bath."

14:14.727 --> 14:18.631
And from that day on, if
I wasn't in his presence,

14:18.665 --> 14:20.133
he assumed I was in a bathtub.

14:20.167 --> 14:22.603
He's all like, "Calgon, take me away."

14:22.638 --> 14:23.708
[Laughter]

14:23.742 --> 14:26.878
So many great memories of bathtub time.

14:26.912 --> 14:27.879
Braggart.

14:27.914 --> 14:29.481
[Laughter]

14:29.515 --> 14:31.884
Just splash around
like Richie rich in a tub.

14:31.918 --> 14:33.487
- Remember Soakies?
- No.

14:33.521 --> 14:36.292
I was never allowed to
do that, because one time,

14:36.326 --> 14:39.530
a Weeble got wet, and the paper
inside the Weeble crumpled,

14:39.564 --> 14:41.364
so from that moment
forward I was never allowed

14:41.398 --> 14:43.699
to take a toy into the tub, so in the tub,

14:43.733 --> 14:46.166
I would just sit there
and study myself, like,

14:46.200 --> 14:48.869
self-loathingly, like,
"why am I floating so much?

14:48.903 --> 14:50.638
I'm like butter in the tub."

14:50.673 --> 14:51.906
[Laughter]

14:51.940 --> 14:52.973
So you're looking to sell them today?

14:53.007 --> 14:54.139
Yeah.

14:54.174 --> 14:55.707
What are you looking to get for them?

14:55.741 --> 15:00.011
I think for the lot
of them maybe 300 bucks.

15:00.046 --> 15:02.512
Rocky and bullwinkle,
they're cool and all,

15:02.547 --> 15:06.249
but if I'm gonna carry
a Soakie in the stash,

15:06.284 --> 15:07.915
it's got to be this guy.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.250
You know, and it's Superman's world.

15:09.285 --> 15:10.987
- We're just living it.
- Yes.

15:11.021 --> 15:13.887
So you disappoint the dude by
saying you only want Superman?

15:13.922 --> 15:15.155
Yes.

15:15.189 --> 15:17.557
He disappoints us all,
because he starts disrobing.

15:17.592 --> 15:19.828
[Laughter]

15:19.862 --> 15:22.364
Very excited to take
a bath with this thing.

15:22.399 --> 15:24.436
Yeah, I figured if I'm
gonna go after one Soakie,

15:24.470 --> 15:25.935
it's got to be Superman.

15:25.970 --> 15:29.103
I could probably flip him a
lot easier than the other three.

15:29.138 --> 15:31.873
All of this sounds so
filthy the way you put it.

15:31.908 --> 15:34.175
Soakie Superman gets flipped and whatnot.

15:34.209 --> 15:35.576
In a bathtub.

15:35.610 --> 15:37.276
[Laughter]

15:37.311 --> 15:39.245
Well, how much would
you ask for just Superman?

15:39.280 --> 15:42.018
- $75.
- 75 bucks, huh?

15:42.052 --> 15:44.452
But you have to remember it's
Superman, which is, you know,

15:44.487 --> 15:45.922
is a hot character.

15:47.024 --> 15:50.190
Would you take 50 for it?

15:50.224 --> 15:52.023
What do you think?
Should I take 50 for it?

15:52.058 --> 15:53.026
Of course you should.

15:53.060 --> 15:55.729
[Laughter]

15:55.763 --> 15:57.864
- Sure.
- Yeah? Got a deal?

15:57.898 --> 15:59.499
- Yeah.
- I'm a great negotiator.

15:59.533 --> 16:01.736
Thanks, man. Thanks
for bringing them in.

16:01.771 --> 16:03.438
- Enjoy it.
- I will, man.

16:03.472 --> 16:05.473
Now you'll know what
he's doing at night.

16:05.507 --> 16:08.941
- Believe me, he already knows.
- I don't want to know.

16:08.976 --> 16:10.641
Does that bring back memories?

16:10.676 --> 16:13.110
I got to say, yeah, man,
some good memories, man.

16:13.145 --> 16:16.479
I mean, that's where,

16:16.514 --> 16:18.483
my imagination really came
out I think, and that...

16:18.518 --> 16:20.053
that's what I'm picturing in my head.

16:20.088 --> 16:21.290
You're 13 and with bubbles.

16:21.324 --> 16:23.625
"While I was nude with
Superman in the tub."

16:23.659 --> 16:26.528
[Laughter]

16:26.562 --> 16:28.531
Anthony, you can't have the banana boat.

16:28.565 --> 16:29.835
- You know why?
- Why?

16:29.869 --> 16:31.536
'Cause I got something better for you,

16:31.570 --> 16:33.202
something special for you, Anthony.

16:45.480 --> 16:46.556
Nice choice, Ern.

16:46.556 --> 16:47.964
Yeah, I think this is the spot.

16:48.642 --> 16:51.141
To be honest, the...
the initial parking spot

16:51.176 --> 16:54.578
that we picked wasn't as
lucrative as I would have hoped,

16:54.613 --> 16:57.749
so I quickly said we had
to find a new parking spot

16:57.783 --> 16:59.451
and went to the park,

16:59.485 --> 17:02.853
and we just see the kids
come a-running like mice

17:02.855 --> 17:04.553
to the pied Piper.

17:04.588 --> 17:06.557
I saw them as rodents.

17:06.590 --> 17:09.593
[Laughter]

17:09.627 --> 17:12.663
Hey, guys. So what can I get you?

17:12.698 --> 17:14.832
Um, rainbow sprinkle cone.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.565
Um, can I have the chocolate sundae?

17:16.598 --> 17:18.432
Could I have the chocolate milk shake?

17:18.465 --> 17:19.902
Well, actually you can't,

17:19.935 --> 17:22.673
because, well, we don't have any ice cream,

17:22.708 --> 17:24.406
- but you know what we do have?
- What.

17:24.442 --> 17:26.840
We have comics, really cool comics.

17:26.875 --> 17:29.490
<i>Check this out. Ming,
three Ghostbusters.</i>

17:29.490 --> 17:30.295
You got it.

17:30.295 --> 17:32.750
<i>Ghostbusters 30th anniversary edition.</i>

17:32.784 --> 17:33.984
It is, like, so cool.

17:34.019 --> 17:35.353
<i>You guys know Ghostbusters, right?</i>

17:35.388 --> 17:36.754
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's really good.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.722
What's your favorite character?

17:40.158 --> 17:41.490
- Say, "Winston."
- Winston.

17:41.525 --> 17:43.124
- Winston.
- That's Winston.

17:43.158 --> 17:45.595
That's the driver of Ecto-1.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.366
"Keep on busting."

17:47.400 --> 17:48.367
There.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.670
Okay, baby.

17:50.704 --> 17:52.969
All right, guys, have fun with your comics.

17:53.003 --> 17:54.137
- Okay.
- Thank you.

17:54.172 --> 17:55.774
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.811
- Huh?
- See?

17:57.846 --> 17:59.214
Told you, man.

17:59.249 --> 18:00.382
I can sell comics.

18:00.417 --> 18:02.184
- What's your name?
- Anthony.

18:02.218 --> 18:04.953
Anthony, you can't have the banana boat.

18:04.987 --> 18:06.121
- You know why?
- Why?

18:06.155 --> 18:07.823
'Cause I got something better for you,

18:07.857 --> 18:09.156
something special for you, Anthony.

18:09.190 --> 18:10.857
<i>How about we get the Green Hornet?</i>

18:10.891 --> 18:11.856
Excellent choice, mom.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.191
<i>Green Hornet, please.</i>

18:13.226 --> 18:15.494
- Move.
- You move.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.829
<i>Cryptozoic Man. You
hip to Cryptozoic Man?</i>

18:17.863 --> 18:19.297
Just point to the one you want.

18:19.331 --> 18:20.699
<i>Green Hornet number 1.</i>

18:20.733 --> 18:23.200
Excellent choice, my
man, excellent choice.

18:23.235 --> 18:25.003
<i>- Do you want Cryptozoic Man?
- Yeah.</i>

18:25.037 --> 18:28.174
<i>Cryptozoic Man.</i>

18:28.208 --> 18:29.975
All right, that'll be $4, mom.

18:30.009 --> 18:32.978
Here you go, bud.

18:33.012 --> 18:34.746
<i>Mike, three Ghostbusters.</i>

18:34.781 --> 18:37.183
<i>Oh, I loved Ghostbusters.
You were awesome.</i>

18:37.217 --> 18:38.484
Thank you.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.318
Tell all your friends about comic car 1.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.321
Okay.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.258
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:44.292 --> 18:46.260
Have you ever sold comics before?

18:46.294 --> 18:47.862
Boy, you are a natural.

18:47.896 --> 18:49.728
I never sold comics before.

18:49.763 --> 18:51.232
I never thought I'd have to.

18:51.266 --> 18:55.272
[Laughter]

18:57.908 --> 19:00.842
We didn't conquer the world,

19:00.876 --> 19:04.710
but the world heard our war cry that day.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.910
The world heard your war cry,

19:06.944 --> 19:09.347
and it was the tinkling
of an ice cream truck

19:09.382 --> 19:12.884
that had no ice cream in
it, but instead, comic books.

19:12.918 --> 19:14.786
And the weapons were lies.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.988
[Laughter]

19:26.267 --> 19:28.271
Mike, what are we looking
at? How much did we make?

19:28.306 --> 19:30.940
Well, when you factor in the cost

19:30.974 --> 19:34.779
of the comics, the
uniforms, the truck rental...

19:34.814 --> 19:37.689
- Right.
- Uh, we've got a profit of $17.

19:37.723 --> 19:38.990
Yes, right?

19:39.025 --> 19:40.426
What a day, huh?

19:40.460 --> 19:44.601
Not a lot of businesses can
say on day one they turn a profit.

19:44.635 --> 19:47.504
It takes years for some
places to turn a profit, right?

19:47.538 --> 19:50.507
Yeah, that's true, but you know what?

19:50.541 --> 19:51.942
I think it's about it for me, man.

19:51.976 --> 19:53.213
I can't, uh...

19:53.247 --> 19:56.284
I can't really work on $17 a day, so...

19:56.319 --> 19:58.821
it's not all yours.

19:58.855 --> 20:00.157
Oh, sorry.

20:00.191 --> 20:02.526
Well, then what is my share in that $17?

20:02.561 --> 20:03.628
What's 17 divided by 5?

20:03.662 --> 20:05.029
$3.25.

20:05.063 --> 20:06.964
$3.25. Okay, all right.

20:06.998 --> 20:09.866
<i>That's about as much as I
made on the first Ghostbusters.</i>

20:09.900 --> 20:11.802
Um, so anyway, yeah.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.068
No, it's been fun, guys, and...
You're out?

20:14.102 --> 20:16.573
Yeah, yeah, you hang on to
your idea though, you know,

20:16.607 --> 20:19.679
and kids really do need to read more,

20:19.714 --> 20:21.246
so I really wish you well with it,

20:21.280 --> 20:23.680
but I think I'm gonna call it a day.

20:23.714 --> 20:25.047
- Good luck. Have fun.
- Thank you.

20:25.081 --> 20:26.314
All right, see you guys later.

20:26.349 --> 20:29.585
- Appreciate it.
- All right, see you later.

20:29.620 --> 20:31.585
You had this dream. You
always wanted to try it.

20:31.619 --> 20:33.148
You did it. You know it works.

20:33.183 --> 20:35.854
It helped that you had
a celebrity at the wheel,

20:35.888 --> 20:37.755
but if it's something you
ever want to think about

20:37.790 --> 20:39.390
pursuing in the future,
you know it's viable now,

20:39.425 --> 20:41.825
a comic bookmobile.

20:41.860 --> 20:44.094
And there it is. We close
the book on another chapter

20:44.129 --> 20:46.362
<i>of the great book of Comic Book Men, man.</i>
