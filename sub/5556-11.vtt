00:01.000 --> 00:03.230
As you come into this world,

00:03.280 --> 00:05.820
something else is also born.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.630
You begin your life, and
it begins a journey...

00:11.680 --> 00:13.270
towards you.

00:13.320 --> 00:16.480
It moves slowly, but it never stops.

00:18.400 --> 00:21.710
Wherever you go, whatever path you take,

00:21.760 --> 00:23.150
it will follow.

00:23.200 --> 00:27.320
Never faster, never slower, always coming.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.510
You will run.

00:30.560 --> 00:32.189
It will walk.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.310
You will rest.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.240
It will not.

00:37.360 --> 00:41.640
One day, you will linger
in the same place too long.

00:42.760 --> 00:47.310
You will sit too still
or sleep too deep...

00:47.360 --> 00:51.600
.. and when, too late, you rise to go...

00:54.600 --> 00:58.630
.. you will notice a
second shadow next to yours.

00:58.680 --> 01:01.520
Your life will then be over.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:59.360 --> 02:01.390
If you think because
she is dead, I am weak,

02:01.440 --> 02:03.750
then you understand very little.

02:03.800 --> 02:07.150
If you were any part of killing
her, and you're not afraid,

02:07.200 --> 02:09.509
then you understand nothing at all.

02:09.560 --> 02:12.550
So, for your own sake, understand this.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.590
I am the Doctor.

02:14.640 --> 02:16.110
I'm coming to find you,

02:16.160 --> 02:18.700
and I will never, ever stop.

03:32.240 --> 03:35.430
The equipment in that room is consistent

03:35.480 --> 03:38.640
with an augmented ultra
long-range teleport.

03:40.240 --> 03:44.030
So, I'm not more than a single
light year from where I was,

03:44.080 --> 03:46.750
and I'm in the same time zone.

03:55.080 --> 03:58.470
When the sun sets, I'll be able
to establish an exact position

03:58.520 --> 04:01.520
by the stars. Then you'll have a choice.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.990
Come out, show yourself,

04:05.040 --> 04:07.040
or keep on hiding.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.710
Clara said I shouldn't take revenge.

04:10.760 --> 04:13.800
You should know, I don't always listen.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.550
Oh, what's this?

04:21.240 --> 04:24.440
Well, are you gardeners? I hate gardening!

04:25.440 --> 04:28.880
What sort of a person has a
power complex about flowers?

04:30.760 --> 04:32.750
It's dictatorship for inadequates.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.430
Or to put it another
way, it's dictatorship.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.030
Come on! Chop, chop!

04:37.080 --> 04:39.270
The Doctor will see you now!

04:39.320 --> 04:41.150
Show me what you've got!

04:41.200 --> 04:44.190
I just watched my best friend die in
agony. My day can't get any worse.

04:44.240 --> 04:47.240
Let's see what we can do about yours!

06:20.120 --> 06:21.720
I know you.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.460
I've seen you before!

06:29.720 --> 06:33.110
I used to know a trick, back
when I was young and telepathic.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.950
Clearly, you can't make an
actual psychic link with a door,

06:36.000 --> 06:37.750
for one very obvious reason --

06:37.800 --> 06:39.710
they're notoriously cross.

06:39.760 --> 06:42.990
I mean, imagine life as a door.
People keep pushing past you.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.150
All of that knocking,
but it's never for you.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.990
And you get locked up every night,

06:47.040 --> 06:50.920
so if you're just a little bit nice...

06:53.840 --> 06:55.440
See, Clara?

06:56.680 --> 06:58.420
Still got it.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.680
But I...

07:07.720 --> 07:09.120
Um...

07:10.280 --> 07:12.910
I can't actually see a way out of this...

07:12.960 --> 07:16.080
I've finally run out of corridor.
There's a life summed up.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.110
Now, this is new. I'm scared.

07:22.160 --> 07:26.390
I just realised that I'm
actually scared of dying.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.540
Something I said?

07:32.920 --> 07:34.720
What did I say?

07:44.280 --> 07:46.220
Why did you stop?

09:02.760 --> 09:05.310
Old. Very old.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.700
Possibly very, very old.

09:14.160 --> 09:17.150
When I was a very little boy,
there was an old lady who died.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.630
They covered her in veils, but it was
a hot, sunny day, and the flies came.

09:20.680 --> 09:24.120
It gave me nightmares for years. So,
who's been stealing my nightmares?

09:25.640 --> 09:27.870
What am I here for?

09:27.920 --> 09:31.680
You've known about me for
a very long time, right?

09:34.360 --> 09:36.880
So, what is it?

09:39.040 --> 09:41.590
Is it a trap?

09:41.640 --> 09:43.270
Is it a prison?

09:43.320 --> 09:44.460
No!

09:46.120 --> 09:48.310
Is it a torture chamber?

09:48.360 --> 09:49.960
Am I right?

09:51.600 --> 09:53.630
Somebody really should know better.

09:53.680 --> 09:58.310
Anyone who can put all of this
together and steal my bad dreams,

09:58.360 --> 10:00.700
they should know better.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.790
The secrets I have -- no chance.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.910
No telling, not me.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.070
I told you I was scared of
dying. And I wasn't lying either.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.920
Advantage -- me!

10:16.080 --> 10:18.950
Because you won't see THIS coming!

10:24.040 --> 10:27.110
Sorry, I'm late! Jumped out of a window.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.350
Certain death. Don't you
want to know how I survived?

10:30.400 --> 10:32.400
Go on. Ask me!

10:33.800 --> 10:36.110
No, of course I had to jump!

10:36.160 --> 10:38.350
The first rule of being interrogated

10:38.400 --> 10:41.110
is that you are the
only irreplaceable person

10:41.160 --> 10:42.630
in the torture chamber.

10:42.680 --> 10:45.430
The room is yours, so work it.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.470
If they're going to
threaten you with death,

10:47.520 --> 10:51.030
show them who's boss. Die faster!

10:51.080 --> 10:54.390
You've seen me do that
more often than most.

10:54.440 --> 10:56.780
Isn't that right, Clara?

11:01.880 --> 11:04.150
Rule one of dying -- don't.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.340
Rule two -- slow down.

11:08.480 --> 11:10.630
You've got the rest of your life.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.950
The faster you think,
the slower it will pass.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.440
Concentrate! Assume you're going
to survive. Always assume that.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.790
Imagine you've already survived.

11:21.840 --> 11:23.550
There's a storm room in your mind.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.630
Lock the door and think!

11:25.680 --> 11:27.350
This is my storm room.

11:27.400 --> 11:31.550
I always imagine that I'm
back in my Tardis, showing off,

11:31.600 --> 11:33.550
telling you how I escaped,

11:33.600 --> 11:34.950
making you laugh.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.630
That's what I'm doing right now.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.820
I am falling, Clara.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.520
I'm dying.

11:43.520 --> 11:47.120
And I'm going to explain
to you how I survived.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.030
I can't wait to hear what I say.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.880
I'm nothing without an audience.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.550
One hope -- salt!

11:59.600 --> 12:02.710
Thought I smelled it earlier. When
I broke the window, I was sure.

12:02.760 --> 12:06.350
Salty air. This castle
is standing in the sea.

12:06.400 --> 12:10.550
Diving into water from a great
height is no guarantee of survival.

12:10.600 --> 12:14.350
I need to know exactly how far
I'm going to fall, and how fast.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.340
Why do you think I threw the stool?

12:20.080 --> 12:22.280
Fall time to impact...

12:22.820 --> 12:24.470
'.. seven seconds.'

12:24.520 --> 12:26.430
Because you won't see this coming!

12:26.480 --> 12:28.510
The wind resistance of the stool,

12:28.560 --> 12:31.030
the atmospheric density...

12:31.440 --> 12:34.430
.. the strength of the local gravity.

12:34.480 --> 12:37.790
Am I spoiling the magic? I
work at this stuff, you know?

12:37.840 --> 12:40.640
Should hit the water in about...

12:43.200 --> 12:44.830
.. 0.02 seconds.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.980
The chances of remaining conscious are...

13:37.680 --> 13:39.750
Can't I just sleep?

13:49.840 --> 13:52.440
Do I have to know everything?

13:59.800 --> 14:02.550
Clara, I can't always...

16:41.400 --> 16:43.430
It keeps coming, Clara.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.710
Wherever I go, it follows. Why?

16:45.760 --> 16:48.040
Why does it do that?

16:49.440 --> 16:53.440
Always the teacher. What's
the right question, then?

16:59.960 --> 17:01.960
It's following me.

17:04.640 --> 17:07.440
Wherever I go, it's tracking me.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.470
Slowly though. Scary lurching.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.060
Scary!

17:16.960 --> 17:18.869
These screens everywhere...

17:18.920 --> 17:21.990
It's showing me exactly
where it is all the time,

17:22.040 --> 17:24.510
how far it's got, how near.

17:27.359 --> 17:30.160
Because it's trying to scare me!

17:30.600 --> 17:32.030
Putting its breath on my neck.

17:32.080 --> 17:35.830
That's the point! That's what
it's doing. This is theatre!

17:35.880 --> 17:37.430
It's all about fear.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.510
Working hypothesis --

17:39.560 --> 17:43.190
I'm in a fully automated haunted
house. A mechanical maze.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.070
It's a killer puzzle box
designed to scare me to death,

17:54.120 --> 17:56.590
and I'm trapped inside it.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.360
Must be Christmas!

19:23.400 --> 19:24.950
Another spade?

19:25.000 --> 19:27.310
Someone wants me to dig.

19:27.360 --> 19:29.030
What do you think, Clara?

19:29.080 --> 19:31.550
Is someone trying to give me a hint?

19:31.600 --> 19:34.030
What would you do?

19:34.080 --> 19:36.750
Yes. Yes, of course you would.

19:40.360 --> 19:43.470
Which, let's be honest,
is what killed you.

19:43.520 --> 19:45.590
So, someone is trying to tell me

19:45.640 --> 19:49.030
that there's something important
buried in this garden.

19:49.080 --> 19:52.750
That's almost the first
thing they tried to tell me.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.230
Could be a trick.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.510
Could be one of my predecessors.

19:56.560 --> 19:59.760
Because I'm not the first
prisoner here, am I?!

20:01.160 --> 20:03.100
All those skulls!

20:04.280 --> 20:07.080
Wonder where they all went wrong.

20:10.760 --> 20:12.670
Building this height,

20:12.720 --> 20:15.460
creature that slow, so what...?

20:17.600 --> 20:19.070
An hour.

21:29.200 --> 21:32.000
Physics of a triangle. You lose!

21:46.640 --> 21:48.120
So?

21:49.720 --> 21:52.260
It can set traps. That's OK.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.280
I'm good at traps.

22:05.640 --> 22:08.040
So, where are you off to?

22:15.040 --> 22:17.840
Only one way in and one way out.

22:18.840 --> 22:21.580
Well, seeing as you're going...

23:01.760 --> 23:04.160
No, no. That's not right.

23:58.720 --> 24:00.710
Well, that was another close one.

24:00.760 --> 24:04.110
Or it will have been, once I've been
and gone and got myself out of it.

24:04.160 --> 24:06.710
So, how am I going to do that?

24:06.760 --> 24:09.700
Come on, teacher, ask me questions!

24:15.600 --> 24:18.200
I'm actually scared of dying.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.670
The truth, yes.

24:25.720 --> 24:27.070
But not any old truth, Clara.

24:27.120 --> 24:30.280
This whole place is designed to
terrify me. I'm being interrogated.

24:31.760 --> 24:35.460
It's not just truth it
wants. That's not enough.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.470
It's confession.

24:41.120 --> 24:44.120
I have to tell truths
I've never told before.

24:46.240 --> 24:49.240
That's the only thing that stops it.

24:54.840 --> 24:57.310
You see, the problem is...

24:58.680 --> 25:00.520
.. Clara...

25:04.520 --> 25:07.720
.. there are truths that I can never tell.

25:10.520 --> 25:12.460
Not for anything.

25:13.480 --> 25:16.080
But I'm scared and I'm alone.

25:17.160 --> 25:18.640
Alone...

25:20.080 --> 25:22.480
.. and very, very scared.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.350
I confess.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.310
I didn't leave Gallifrey
because I was bored!

25:33.360 --> 25:36.560
That was a lie! It's always been a lie!

25:38.600 --> 25:41.320
Not enough? You want more?

25:43.920 --> 25:46.910
I was scared! I ran because I was scared!

25:46.960 --> 25:51.660
Is that what you want me to
say? Is that true enough for you?

27:00.000 --> 27:04.630
'It's funny, the day you
lose someone isn't the worst.

27:04.680 --> 27:07.680
'At least you've got something to do.

27:09.080 --> 27:12.020
'It's all the days they stay dead.'

27:23.760 --> 27:25.360
57 minutes.

27:29.680 --> 27:32.230
This is how my world works, Clara.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.550
I tick off the seconds as they pass.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.880
My life is a countdown.

27:38.680 --> 27:42.030
If I draw the creature to
one extreme of the castle,

27:42.080 --> 27:45.270
and I run to the other extreme,

27:45.320 --> 27:49.440
I can earn myself a maximum of 82 minutes.

27:51.960 --> 27:54.230
82 minutes to eat,

27:54.280 --> 27:56.310
sleep and work.

27:56.360 --> 28:00.350
My work is finding Room 12.

28:00.400 --> 28:03.520
The castle wants me to. It's luring me.

28:09.960 --> 28:11.750
The numbering is a bit confused,

28:11.800 --> 28:14.740
as if the rooms are all jumbled up.

28:15.880 --> 28:18.150
Maybe they move around.

28:20.560 --> 28:23.230
I saw the whole castle move...

28:25.120 --> 28:27.920
.. when I made the creature stop.

28:32.600 --> 28:35.190
Every room, if I leave it long enough,

28:35.240 --> 28:38.940
reverts to its condition
at the moment I arrive.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.790
It tidies up after itself.

28:43.840 --> 28:46.110
Automated room service.

28:52.480 --> 28:56.510
I think this whole place is
inside a closed energy loop,

28:56.560 --> 28:58.700
constantly recycling.

28:59.840 --> 29:02.030
Or maybe I'm in Hell?

29:02.080 --> 29:04.030
That's OK. I'm not scared of Hell.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.880
It's just Heaven for bad people.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.720
But how long will I have to be here?

29:15.520 --> 29:18.480
Forever?

29:25.320 --> 29:27.390
It's always coming.

29:28.320 --> 29:31.070
Always closer.

29:31.120 --> 29:33.670
The countdown never stops.

29:33.720 --> 29:36.190
But the countdown to what?

29:43.080 --> 29:47.150
There are two events in everybody's
life that nobody remembers,

29:47.200 --> 29:50.910
two moments experienced
by every living thing.

29:50.960 --> 29:54.160
Yet, no-one remembers anything about them.

29:59.080 --> 30:02.030
Nobody remembers being born...

30:02.080 --> 30:04.550
and nobody remembers dying.

30:06.160 --> 30:10.550
Is that why we always stare
into the eye sockets of a skull?

30:10.600 --> 30:12.190
Because we're asking,

30:12.240 --> 30:14.350
"What was it like?

30:14.400 --> 30:16.070
"Does it hurt?

30:16.120 --> 30:18.390
"Are you still scared?"

30:21.560 --> 30:25.110
"Bird"? What's "bird" got to do with it?

30:25.160 --> 30:27.300
Are there birds here?

31:06.320 --> 31:08.630
There's something I'm missing, Clara,

31:08.680 --> 31:11.680
and I think it's something terrible.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.750
Hello?

31:55.800 --> 31:58.800
Hello, is there someone there? Hello!

32:06.560 --> 32:08.630
It's a trap, Clara.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.400
A lure and a trap.

32:22.880 --> 32:26.080
I'm following breadcrumbs laid out for me.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.470
This is somebody's game...

32:33.280 --> 32:34.830
.. and I can't stop playing,

32:34.880 --> 32:37.840
a game everybody else has lost.

32:39.160 --> 32:41.430
I know how to move that wall, Clara,

32:41.480 --> 32:44.270
so long as I don't run out of confessions.

32:44.320 --> 32:46.670
But what I really want to know is...

32:46.720 --> 32:49.270
.. who's been playing
about with the stars?

32:49.320 --> 32:51.630
They're all in the wrong places,

32:51.680 --> 32:54.150
for this time zone, anyway.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.990
I know I didn't time travel to get here.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.870
I can FEEL time travel.

32:59.920 --> 33:02.910
If I didn't know better, I'd
say I've travelled 7,000 years

33:02.960 --> 33:04.830
into the future.

33:05.960 --> 33:07.710
But I do know better.

33:07.760 --> 33:10.100
So, who moved the stars?

33:15.760 --> 33:17.480
The Hybrid.

33:23.120 --> 33:24.750
Long before the Time War,

33:24.800 --> 33:27.030
the Time Lords knew it was coming,

33:27.080 --> 33:29.550
like a storm on the wind.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.910
There were many prophecies and stories,

33:31.960 --> 33:33.950
legends before the fact.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.400
One of them was about a
creature called the Hybrid.

33:39.840 --> 33:43.110
Half Dalek, half Time Lord --

33:43.160 --> 33:45.070
the ultimate warrior.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.830
But whose side would it be on?

33:46.880 --> 33:49.350
Would it bring peace or destruction?

33:49.400 --> 33:52.630
Was it real, or a fantasy?

33:52.680 --> 33:54.790
I confess,

33:54.840 --> 33:57.310
I know the Hybrid is real.

33:57.360 --> 33:59.990
I know where it is, and what it is.

34:00.040 --> 34:03.190
I confess, I'm afraid.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.190
Of course!

35:46.240 --> 35:48.430
The last square on the board.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.680
What else would it be?

35:52.160 --> 35:54.190
The Tardis.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.380
One confession away.

36:01.120 --> 36:03.670
Azbantium.

36:03.720 --> 36:06.390
400 times harder than diamond.

36:09.560 --> 36:11.360
20 feet thick.

36:15.320 --> 36:16.990
The way out.

36:21.160 --> 36:22.680
Bird!

36:34.560 --> 36:36.870
That's when I remember!

36:36.920 --> 36:38.510
Always then.

36:38.560 --> 36:40.590
Always... then.

36:40.640 --> 36:42.780
Always EXACTLY then!

36:46.320 --> 36:50.000
I can't keep doing this, Clara! I can't!

36:51.080 --> 36:54.230
Why is it always me? Why is
it never anybody else's turn?!

36:59.600 --> 37:01.600
Can't I just lose?

37:02.560 --> 37:04.430
Just this once?!

37:05.640 --> 37:07.910
Easy. It would be easy.

37:08.120 --> 37:10.510
It would be SO easy.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.590
Just tell them.

37:11.640 --> 37:15.160
Just tell them, whoever wants
to know, all about the Hybrid.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.500
I can't keep doing this.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.390
I can't...

37:32.440 --> 37:34.710
I can't always do this!

37:35.480 --> 37:37.190
It's not fair!

37:37.240 --> 37:38.910
Clara, it's just not fair!

37:38.960 --> 37:41.230
Why can't I just lose?!

37:46.360 --> 37:48.830
But I can remember, Clara.

37:49.320 --> 37:51.190
You don't understand,

37:51.240 --> 37:53.440
I can remember it all.

37:54.040 --> 37:55.640
Every time.

38:00.360 --> 38:02.760
And you'll still be gone.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.470
Whatever I do...

38:12.200 --> 38:14.740
.. you still won't be there.

38:21.320 --> 38:22.790
Doctor...

38:23.800 --> 38:27.670
.. you are not the only
person who ever lost someone.

38:27.720 --> 38:29.510
It's the story of everybody.

38:29.560 --> 38:30.870
Get over it.

38:30.920 --> 38:32.760
Beat it.

38:33.960 --> 38:35.560
Break free.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.520
Doctor, it's time.

38:46.880 --> 38:49.220
Get up, off your arse...

38:50.720 --> 38:52.320
.. and win!

38:59.560 --> 39:00.950
Hello again.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.470
No more confessions, sorry.

39:05.720 --> 39:10.240
But I will tell you... the truth.

39:29.320 --> 39:31.950
The Hybrid is a very dangerous secret.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.950
A very, very dangerous secret
and it needs to be kept!

39:40.800 --> 39:44.080
So, I'm telling you
nothing. Nothing at all.

39:45.640 --> 39:48.960
Instead, I'm going to
do something far worse.

39:50.040 --> 39:51.720
Argh!

39:53.520 --> 39:55.350
I'm going to get out of here,

39:55.400 --> 39:59.350
and find whoever put me
here in the first place,

39:59.400 --> 40:03.190
and whatever they're trying to
do, I'm going to... stop it!

40:03.240 --> 40:04.800
Argh!

40:11.960 --> 40:13.630
But it might take me a little while,

40:13.680 --> 40:16.780
so do you want me to tell you a story?

40:20.600 --> 40:23.670
The Brothers Grimm, lovely fellas...

40:23.720 --> 40:25.150
They're on my darts team.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.470
Argh!

40:29.280 --> 40:32.030
According to them,

40:32.080 --> 40:33.950
there's this emperor

40:34.000 --> 40:37.360
and he asks this shepherd's boy...

40:38.720 --> 40:42.320
.."How many seconds in eternity?"

41:30.320 --> 41:33.350
People always get it
wrong with Time Lords.

41:33.400 --> 41:35.670
We take forever to die.

41:39.280 --> 41:41.990
Even if we're too injured to regenerate,

41:42.040 --> 41:45.140
every cell in our bodies keeps trying.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.950
Dying properly,

41:49.000 --> 41:50.430
can take days.

41:50.480 --> 41:53.980
That's why we like to
die among our own kind.

41:56.480 --> 41:59.220
They know not to bury us early.

42:01.520 --> 42:04.460
I think, in my current condition...

42:06.120 --> 42:09.270
.. it'll take me about a day and a half

42:09.320 --> 42:11.990
to reach the top of the tower.

42:14.440 --> 42:16.160
I think.

42:17.560 --> 42:19.360
If I'm lucky...

42:21.000 --> 42:23.470
.. I have a day and a half.

42:26.320 --> 42:28.720
I have to do this, Clara.

42:29.920 --> 42:31.920
It's the only way.

42:34.680 --> 42:36.820
I have to be strong.

42:39.520 --> 42:42.790
I should have known
from the very beginning.

42:42.840 --> 42:44.480
Of course.

42:45.840 --> 42:47.190
The portrait of you,

42:47.240 --> 42:50.340
the creature from my own nightmares...

42:52.640 --> 42:56.240
This place is my own,
bespoke torture chamber...

42:58.280 --> 43:00.470
.. intended for me only,

43:00.520 --> 43:03.920
and all those skulls in the water...

43:05.880 --> 43:10.560
How could there be other
prisoners... in my hell?

43:13.520 --> 43:17.150
The answer, of course,

43:17.200 --> 43:20.240
is there never were any other prisoners.

43:22.960 --> 43:24.830
And the stars...

43:30.320 --> 43:33.190
They weren't in the wrong place...

43:34.000 --> 43:36.800
.. and I haven't time travelled.

43:45.960 --> 43:48.550
I've just been here

43:48.600 --> 43:54.680
a very, very long time.

43:57.280 --> 43:59.510
Every room resets.

43:59.560 --> 44:01.960
Remember I told you that?

44:02.360 --> 44:05.860
Every room reverts to
its original condition.

44:06.120 --> 44:11.190
Logically, the teleporter
should do the same.

44:11.240 --> 44:14.110
"Teleporter" -- fancy word.

44:14.160 --> 44:16.630
Just like 3D printers, really,

44:16.680 --> 44:20.880
except they break down living matter
and information, and transmit it.

44:22.200 --> 44:25.000
All you have to do is add energy.

44:28.240 --> 44:30.510
The room has reset,

44:30.560 --> 44:33.830
returned to its original
condition when I arrived.

44:33.880 --> 44:37.790
That means there's a copy of me

44:37.840 --> 44:40.180
still in the hard drive.

44:42.040 --> 44:45.920
Me, exactly as I was...

44:47.560 --> 44:50.030
.. when I first got here...

44:50.280 --> 44:52.350
.. 7,000 years ago.

44:56.040 --> 44:59.080
All I have to find is some energy.

45:02.400 --> 45:05.070
And all you need for energy...

45:06.080 --> 45:08.420
.. is something to burn.

45:50.240 --> 45:53.340
How long can I keep doing this, Clara?

45:54.720 --> 45:56.860
Burning the old me...

45:57.920 --> 46:00.060
.. to make a new one?

46:44.520 --> 46:46.670
If you think because
she's dead, I am weak,

46:46.720 --> 46:49.520
then you understand very little.

46:50.320 --> 46:54.030
If you were any part of killing
her and you're not afraid,

46:54.080 --> 46:56.190
then you understand nothing at all.

46:56.240 --> 46:59.030
So, for your own sake, understand this.

46:59.080 --> 47:02.110
I'm the Doctor. I'm coming to find you,

47:02.160 --> 47:04.700
and I will never, ever stop.

47:16.440 --> 47:19.310
Because you won't see THIS coming!

47:37.320 --> 47:38.630
If I didn't know better,

47:38.680 --> 47:42.240
I'd say I've travelled 7,000
years into the future.

47:47.160 --> 47:48.310
Aah!

47:48.360 --> 47:51.590
"How many seconds in eternity?"

48:09.720 --> 48:12.830
If I didn't know better, I'd
say I've travelled 12,000 years

48:12.880 --> 48:14.750
into the future.

48:19.480 --> 48:22.220
"How many seconds in eternity?"

48:23.440 --> 48:25.870
And the shepherd's boy...

48:34.160 --> 48:36.550
.. 600,000 years into the future.

48:36.600 --> 48:37.630
Argh!

48:37.680 --> 48:39.830
"How many seconds in eternity?"

48:39.880 --> 48:41.990
And the shepherd's boy says...

48:42.040 --> 48:43.310
Argh!

48:51.440 --> 48:54.380
.. 1,200,000 years into the future.

48:55.600 --> 48:57.350
.. And the shepherd's boy says...

48:57.400 --> 48:58.670
Argh!

49:00.960 --> 49:03.960
.. Two million years into the future.

49:06.520 --> 49:09.320
.. And the shepherd's boy says...

49:24.400 --> 49:27.400
.. 20 million years into the future.

49:28.120 --> 49:29.670
Ow!

49:29.720 --> 49:32.870
And the shepherd's boy says...

49:32.920 --> 49:35.750
"There's this mountain of pure diamond.

49:35.800 --> 49:39.440
"It takes an hour to climb it,
and an hour to go around it!"

49:52.240 --> 49:54.380
.. 52 million years.

49:55.960 --> 50:00.630
"Every hundred years, a little bird comes

50:00.680 --> 50:04.580
"and sharpens its beak on
the diamond mountain..."

50:10.320 --> 50:11.990
.. Nearly a billion years.

50:12.040 --> 50:13.830
Argh!

50:13.880 --> 50:16.470
".. And when the entire
mountain is chiselled away,

50:16.520 --> 50:20.990
"the first second of
eternity will have passed!"

50:24.160 --> 50:25.510
.. Well over a billion years.

50:25.560 --> 50:26.990
Argh!

50:27.040 --> 50:30.440
You must think that's
a hell of a long time.

50:31.640 --> 50:33.780
.. Two billion years.

50:35.200 --> 50:38.300
Personally, I think that's a hell of a...

50:39.440 --> 50:40.880
Aaargh!

50:58.800 --> 51:02.200
Personally, I think
that's a hell of a bird.

51:56.400 --> 51:57.470
Go to the city.

51:57.520 --> 51:59.510
Find somebody important.

51:59.560 --> 52:01.990
Tell them, I'm back.

52:02.040 --> 52:04.910
Tell them, I know what they did,

52:04.960 --> 52:06.960
and I'm on my way.

52:08.080 --> 52:10.830
And if they ask you who I am,

52:10.880 --> 52:13.880
tell them, I came the long way round.

52:33.320 --> 52:36.120
You can probably still hear me...

52:37.040 --> 52:39.780
.. so just between ourselves...

52:40.480 --> 52:43.190
.. you've got the prophecy wrong.

52:43.240 --> 52:45.350
The Hybrid is not half Dalek.

52:45.400 --> 52:48.470
Nothing is half Dalek. The
Daleks would never allow that.

52:48.520 --> 52:51.990
The Hybrid destined to conquer Gallifrey

52:52.040 --> 52:54.440
and stand in its ruins...

52:58.840 --> 53:00.480
.. is me.

53:31.520 --> 53:34.230
The Hybrid. I think it's
time to tell the truth.

53:34.280 --> 53:36.350
I heard the Doctor had come home.

53:36.400 --> 53:37.950
One so loves fireworks.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.710
What's he up to?

53:39.760 --> 53:42.630
The Hybrid is a creature
thought to be crossbred

53:42.680 --> 53:44.190
from two warrior races.

53:44.240 --> 53:45.510
I know I went too far.

53:45.560 --> 53:48.470
You have broken every
code you ever lived by.

53:48.520 --> 53:50.350
On my command!

53:50.400 --> 53:51.550
Is it true?

53:51.600 --> 53:53.070
- She's my friend.
- Fire!

53:53.120 --> 53:55.950
Med-team to Sector 52,
extraction chamber seven.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.120
Regeneration in progress.
