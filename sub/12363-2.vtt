13:58.037 --> 14:01.406
I own the gym on memorial drive.
We do a little boxing.

Sometimes things get out of hand
when we spar.

Is this a bad time?

14:06.379 --> 14:08.780

a pretty tight schedule.

about ross lanten.

14:14.988 --> 14:19.524
Well, when he's not getting
drunk and leering at my wife,

14:19.526 --> 14:21.292
He's over there
screaming at his own.

to be home right now.

You know where
I might find her?

14:24.464 --> 14:26.798

to live with her mother.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.838

to take the kids and leave him.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.174
How did you manage that?
Brandi: Uh, video.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.543
Ross and marcie got into another
one of their big blowouts.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.346
And when ross left,
greg decided to follow him.

14:41.348 --> 14:44.549
I was so mad, I thought I was
gonna confront him at first,

14:44.551 --> 14:46.184
And then he pulled into
saddle horn truck stop

14:46.186 --> 14:49.153
And started talking
to these girls.
Prostitutes.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.688
So I grabbed the phone
and I took some video.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.090
When we showed marcie,

14:52.092 --> 14:54.425
That's what finally
convinced her to leave him.

defense wounds on his hands.

14:58.865 --> 15:01.900
The collettes aren't shy about
how much they hate the man.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.669
Not too shy about interfering
in his marriage, either.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.437
Neither one of them

about lanten.

Try and track down
ross lanten's wife.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.903
Maybe you could use some help
with that.

15:38.905 --> 15:42.774
Some inspiration, perhaps.
Maybe a racy scandal?

that you learn is,
