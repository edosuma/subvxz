00:00.480 --> 00:01.640
Oh, come on, Melissa.

00:01.650 --> 00:04.380
How long are you gonna
keep punishing me for this?

00:04.740 --> 00:10.560
Okay, okay, uh, once again, uh, I did not
technically have sex with your mother.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.010
You want to catch me up?

00:14.020 --> 00:16.850
- Melissa, are you gonna let me talk?
- Well, you know Alan was nailing his receptionist, right?

00:16.860 --> 00:17.610
Yeah.

00:17.650 --> 00:20.610
- Apparently, she caught him in bed with her mother.
- Are you gonna let me talk?

00:20.620 --> 00:21.890
What do you know?

00:21.930 --> 00:25.300
I've been calling him that for
years, and now he's up and done it.

00:26.070 --> 00:30.840
I was not responsible for my actions.
I was stoned out of my mind.

00:31.270 --> 00:34.240
You know, that excuse has
never once worked for me.

00:34.670 --> 00:37.610
Me, either. Copsorboyfriends.

00:38.010 --> 00:41.120
No. Hey, hey, hey, your mother put
enough pot in that bana bread

00:41.130 --> 00:44.570
to treat every case of glaucoma
in the San Fernando Valley.

00:44.990 --> 00:48.590
I have a recipe for
macaroons. Very similar.

00:49.470 --> 00:52.540
I was so high, I didn't
even know who she was.

00:52.560 --> 00:54.710
We were just colors.

00:55.420 --> 00:57.960
I was red, she was blue.

00:57.990 --> 01:00.390
We were trying to make purple.

01:00.750 --> 01:02.520
Honey, my phone's dead.
Can I borrow your cell?

01:02.530 --> 01:04.959
- Sure. It's on the coffee table.
- Thanks.

01:04.970 --> 01:09.700
Okay, so-so bottom line, I was drugged and
molested by your mother, andI'mthe bad guy?

01:10.610 --> 01:14.350
Man, how many times have I
heard you make this phone call?

01:15.160 --> 01:20.480
Yeah, who'd have thought, of the two of us, I'd be
the one to end up in a healthy, stable relationship?

01:22.110 --> 01:25.980
Who is Rachel, and why is she
sending you topless photos?

01:27.250 --> 01:29.870
Yeah, who'd have thought?

The Two Finger Rule

02:00.080 --> 02:04.410
You want to explain to me why this woman
is sending you naked pictures of herself?

02:04.440 --> 02:06.650
I'd love to explain it.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.030
Go ahead.

02:13.060 --> 02:15.560
I said I'd love to.
I didn't say I could.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.740
Are you sleeping with her?

02:17.770 --> 02:19.890
No, no, of course not.

02:19.920 --> 02:22.090
Then why the pictures?

02:22.120 --> 02:27.930
Uh, well, my-my-my-my... my best guess
would be that, like a lot of girls,

02:27.940 --> 02:32.140
she wanted to show off her new boob job.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.540
That'syour best guess?

02:35.560 --> 02:41.030
Well, you wouldn't understand because clearly,
God has blessed you with this great bounty.

02:41.040 --> 02:44.010
- Damn it, Charlie, I want to know...
- Excuse me. I am on the phone.

02:44.780 --> 02:46.340
Alan's on the phone.

02:46.350 --> 02:49.480
Don't shush me. Who is this Rachel?

02:49.490 --> 02:50.800
Nobody really.

02:50.830 --> 02:55.650
I used to go out with her way, way before
you and I met and I fell so deeply in love.

02:55.680 --> 02:59.220
Head-over-heels in love.
Puppy dog love. Woof!

03:00.280 --> 03:04.130
Hang on, Melissa. I couldn't hear
anything after "You son of a bitch."

03:04.610 --> 03:06.970
Does this Rachel know you're engaged?

03:07.810 --> 03:11.460
Think long and hard before
you start lying to me.

03:11.480 --> 03:14.130
I was. That's why I said, "Um..."

03:14.140 --> 03:16.360
- Charlie...
- She doesn't know.

03:16.370 --> 03:17.950
Why not?

03:17.980 --> 03:21.280
Boy, you're gonna keep this
flapjack on the griddle, aren't you?

03:26.720 --> 03:28.360
Berta, would you give us a minute?

03:28.390 --> 03:31.140
Oh, you're gonna need more than a minute.

03:32.940 --> 03:35.420
So long. I'm gonna miss you.

03:35.850 --> 03:38.060
What are you talking about?
She's not going anywhere.

03:38.070 --> 03:41.150
Are you? Where-where
you going? Chelsea?

03:41.490 --> 03:42.430
Chelsea, wait.

03:42.470 --> 03:43.780
Can't we just put this behind us?

03:43.820 --> 03:46.750
I
- I swear I'll never make out with your mother again.

03:48.260 --> 03:51.530
Let's face it, Charlie. We both knew
you were gonna blow it eventually.

03:51.540 --> 03:54.910
I didn't. I had my
suspicions, but I wasn't sure.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.640
I wish I could say the same. Good-bye.

03:58.550 --> 04:00.600
- Oh, please don't leave.
- Oh, please don't hang up.

04:00.610 --> 04:03.200
I love you!

04:04.480 --> 04:07.810
And I love you, too.

04:12.540 --> 04:13.850
Sure you don't want a drink?

04:13.880 --> 04:17.300
No. When I'm depressed, alcohol
just makes me feel worse.

04:18.240 --> 04:21.630
Yeah, see, the trick
is to drink past that.

04:23.150 --> 04:26.110
Not a sprint, it's a marathon.

04:27.210 --> 04:30.680
You ever think we're both doomed
to grow old alone and unloved?

04:30.710 --> 04:34.450
A couple of pathetic bachelors with
no one to talk to but each other?

04:35.360 --> 04:38.200
You ought to do ads for this stuff.

04:39.470 --> 04:42.330
So, are you gonna tell me
what happened with Chelsea?

04:42.920 --> 04:45.570
I can show you.

04:45.580 --> 04:49.320
Chelsea found this on my phone.

04:49.330 --> 04:53.190
I ask you, is that worth
breaking an engagement?

04:59.430 --> 05:02.070
It's worth breaking a spine.

05:02.430 --> 05:03.780
Were you sleeping with this girl?

05:03.800 --> 05:06.820
No. No. She just sent me a few pictures.

05:06.830 --> 05:09.710
Well, then, why'd you keep 'em?

05:11.030 --> 05:13.290
All right, all right, all right.

05:13.310 --> 05:17.330
But you got to understand the-the
message that this sends to Chelsea.

05:17.370 --> 05:21.670
Other than, you know, "Got milk?"

05:25.890 --> 05:27.300
But I'm not cheating.

05:27.340 --> 05:30.530
There are other forms of cheating.
There's, uh... there's, uh, flirting.

05:30.540 --> 05:32.090
There's fantasizing about other women...

05:32.110 --> 05:34.660
Oh, come on. Fantasizing is not cheating.

05:34.670 --> 05:39.270
To women it is. They-they don't like the idea that
you're mentally replacing them with someone else.

05:40.460 --> 05:44.160
What if I'm mentally
supplementingthem with someone else?

05:44.190 --> 05:49.080
You know, like I'm making love to Chelsea, and
in my mind, Rachel here is just helping out.

05:53.730 --> 05:57.030
She does look very helpful.

05:57.040 --> 06:00.890
Nevertheless, I-I can understand why
Chelsea would take a dimmer view.

06:00.910 --> 06:03.070
Yeah, well, I think she overreacted.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.270
In fact, I think she owes me an apology.

06:05.280 --> 06:08.510
Really? So, you're just gonna sit here and
wait till she comes crawling back, are you?

06:08.520 --> 06:10.780
Yes, I am.

06:10.790 --> 06:16.110
And then, because hell will long since
have frozen over, we can go ice-skating.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.760
It's good that you have a plan.

06:20.370 --> 06:24.690
Now if you will pardon me, I have
to go pick up Jake at his mother's.

06:24.720 --> 06:27.890
Oh, good. Just what we need
to brighten up our weekend.

06:27.900 --> 06:32.310
A large, sullen teenager with
gas and questionable hygiene.

06:32.670 --> 06:35.710
There's nothing questionable about it.

06:42.520 --> 06:46.770
There we go. Over the hump.

06:50.240 --> 06:53.580
She's my mother, Herb! I want
her here when I have the baby!

06:53.590 --> 06:57.890
Yeah, well, I don't need yet another woman in
this house yelling at me, calling me an idiot!

06:57.910 --> 06:59.930
My mother doesn't yell, you idiot!

06:59.970 --> 07:02.340
Okay, I'm gonna let that
pass because you're pregnant!

07:02.370 --> 07:04.760
Don't you dare blame this on hormones!

07:04.800 --> 07:08.730
What's my alternative, Judith?
Accept the fact that I'm an idiot?

07:11.650 --> 07:13.240
Oh, hey, Alan.

07:13.260 --> 07:14.900
Is this a bad time?

07:14.910 --> 07:17.170
They're all bad.

07:17.820 --> 07:20.280
Seven-and-a-half
months of bad.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.740
Don't you walk away from me.

07:21.770 --> 07:23.450
Well, I'm sorry. I was
answering the door!

07:23.460 --> 07:26.460
That's what we idiots do
when we hear a doorbell.

07:27.230 --> 07:29.620
Hi, Dad. Bye, Mom. Good luck, Herb.

07:30.360 --> 07:33.150
Bye, Jake. Wish I was going with you.

07:39.900 --> 07:42.650
I knew it as soon as
it came out of my mouth.

07:50.820 --> 07:53.110
I could get used to this.

07:53.590 --> 07:55.750
Don't.

07:57.520 --> 08:01.450
As far as Charlie is
concerned, mi casa es mi casa.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.500
All right, I've ordered
your pizza. I'm going home.

08:05.510 --> 08:07.690
Thanks, Berta.

08:08.170 --> 08:12.760
Ordering a pizza and going home- two
of the three things you want in a woman.

08:13.470 --> 08:16.360
And you wonder why Chelsea dumped you.

08:16.370 --> 08:18.520
I'll tell you what I wonder.

08:18.560 --> 08:21.710
I wonder how you could possibly get
stoned enough to stick your tongue

08:21.720 --> 08:25.080
in the mouth of a
60-year-old woman.

08:29.730 --> 08:31.670
Zing!

08:33.659 --> 08:38.000
Boy, I just love this male bonding.
Giving each other the old business.

08:38.010 --> 08:39.530
The old business?

08:39.570 --> 08:44.059
Yeah, you know, the needle,
the zetz, the razzmatazz.

08:44.910 --> 08:46.910
Herb, I got to ask you something.

08:46.940 --> 08:50.020
Are there any other
guys you hang out with?

08:50.050 --> 08:52.800
Oh, sure, I have my peeps.

08:52.840 --> 08:57.670
There's my, uh, water polo league,
the guys down at the model train shop.

08:57.890 --> 09:00.120
Oh, and my, uh, barbershop quartet.

09:00.150 --> 09:02.250
Although I can't have them
over to the house anymore.

09:02.260 --> 09:03.500
Why not?

09:03.540 --> 09:06.390
Four part harmony triggers
Judith's migraines.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.440
Plus, mustaches creep her out.

09:09.460 --> 09:12.070
Oh, not just mustaches.
Any facial hair whatsoever.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.340
Except eyebrows.

09:13.380 --> 09:16.410
- Neatly trimmed.
- Right. The two finger rule.

09:19.280 --> 09:21.090
Chelsea had a two finger rule.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.730
Nothing to do with eyebrows, though.

09:24.460 --> 09:26.110
All right, I'll see you later.

09:26.120 --> 09:27.010
Where are you going?

09:27.050 --> 09:28.490
Down to the pier with Celeste.

09:28.530 --> 09:30.880
- Who's Celeste?
- My girlfriend. She lives next door.

09:30.890 --> 09:31.670
Is she pretty?

09:31.700 --> 09:34.640
She's gorgeous and smart and popular.

09:34.660 --> 09:37.550
- No kidding?
- We don't get it, either.

09:39.760 --> 09:41.820
Maybe she's punishing her father.

09:41.830 --> 09:44.050
Let's hope so.

09:45.900 --> 09:49.900
You know, I'm just the stepdad here,
but, uh, shouldn't you tell him what time to be home?

09:49.920 --> 09:52.960
I don't have to. I know her father.

09:53.610 --> 09:55.750
Hey, Jake.

09:57.700 --> 09:59.900
Hello, sir.

10:00.510 --> 10:04.290
Celeste, Jake's here!
So how have you been?

10:04.300 --> 10:08.160
We're walking down to the pier, we're
gonna play skeeball, we'll be back by 11:00.

10:09.570 --> 10:12.370
You're damn right you will.

10:18.350 --> 10:20.770
Come on. It's freezing out here.

10:20.780 --> 10:23.140
Shouldn't we put out the cigars?

10:23.400 --> 10:25.220
Why?

10:25.570 --> 10:28.230
'cause we're not allowed
to smoke in the house?

10:30.180 --> 10:34.650
It's my house. We can smoke cigars,
we can smoke salmon, whatever we want.

10:35.990 --> 10:37.260
Are you sure?

10:37.280 --> 10:40.110
Relax. No whiny broad
is going to nag at you.

10:40.120 --> 10:43.300
Uh, Herb, make sure you use
an ashtray and a coaster.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.380
I stand corrected.

10:49.230 --> 10:51.310
Zing!

10:51.650 --> 10:53.910
Hotcha!

10:56.080 --> 10:58.510
Oh, this is going to be a long night.

11:01.660 --> 11:02.810
Hi, Charlie.

11:02.840 --> 11:05.370
Oh, God. What did the
little knucklehead do?

11:05.380 --> 11:08.560
Nothing- Jake said you guys were hanging
out, and I thought you might want some company.

11:08.580 --> 11:09.560
Sure, come on in.

11:09.580 --> 11:11.850
I baked snickerdoodles if you're hungry.

11:13.580 --> 11:17.400
- You baked snickerdoodles?
- Yeah- why is that funny?

11:19.630 --> 11:21.560
It's not.

11:22.490 --> 11:24.780
You know Alan, and this is Herb.

11:25.770 --> 11:28.130
Make yourself comfortable. Can
I get you something to drink?

11:28.140 --> 11:31.030
I wouldn't say no to an apple-tini.

11:31.660 --> 11:35.250
An apple-tini? My brother
drinks apple-tinis.

11:35.620 --> 11:38.080
Why is that funny?

11:38.090 --> 11:40.140
It's not.

11:40.470 --> 11:43.070
One apple-tini coming up.

11:43.450 --> 11:46.110
He can get away with it; you can't.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.380
So, how do you know Charlie and Alan?

11:49.400 --> 11:51.610
Oh, I'm married to Alan's ex-wife.

11:51.630 --> 11:53.950
No kidding. And you hang out?

11:53.960 --> 11:55.690
- Yeah.
- Sure.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.810
I couldn't be friends with the
man who's putting it to my ex.

12:04.710 --> 12:08.410
Well, to be fair, there hasn't
been a lot of putting lately.

12:11.030 --> 12:13.610
And after the baby's born,
there will be even less.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.440
How is that possible?

12:16.450 --> 12:21.660
Not only will she not let you touch her, she'll
interrupt you while you're touching yourself.

12:31.310 --> 12:33.770
I had to start showering at the Y.

12:36.040 --> 12:39.460
- Okay, one apple-tini.
- Thank you.

12:39.870 --> 12:40.970
What are you guys talking about?

12:41.010 --> 12:43.510
Masturbating at the YMCA.

12:48.620 --> 12:51.510
Really? Just talk, right?

12:51.520 --> 12:54.180
Yeah, but the night is young.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.780
So, Jerome...

12:56.810 --> 13:00.190
solve one of the great
mysteries of life for us.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.180
What does your daughter see in Jake?

13:04.190 --> 13:07.680
You know, I've been asking
myself the same thing.

13:07.710 --> 13:10.500
Maybe she's punishing me.

13:11.780 --> 13:14.410
- No offense.
- None taken.

13:15.210 --> 13:17.260
We're way ahead of you.

13:18.070 --> 13:20.880
You know, my wife and I are
having a girl. Any advice?

13:20.890 --> 13:25.270
Yeah. Before your daughter
starts dating, um, bulk up.

13:27.930 --> 13:29.610
Okay.

13:31.460 --> 13:34.040
Boy. Remember when we
first started dating?

13:34.050 --> 13:37.040
Yep, eighth grade. Louise Miller.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.170
Oh, ninth grade. Maxine Chernakoff.

13:39.180 --> 13:42.160
Sixth grade, Mrs. Terapotta.

13:47.670 --> 13:50.240
Wasn't actually a date.

13:50.270 --> 13:52.930
Nowadays, she'd probably go to jail.

13:53.330 --> 13:55.190
So, uh, what about you, Herb?

13:55.220 --> 13:56.210
What about me, what?

13:56.250 --> 13:58.380
Uh, your first date.
Uh, junior high, high school?

13:58.390 --> 14:02.470
College, freshman year. I was
kind of a geek in high school.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.570
Hard to believe.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.280
No, really. They called me Big Bird.

14:09.780 --> 14:11.620
So, what happened in college?

14:11.640 --> 14:14.910
I stopped wearing yellow
shirts and lowered my standards.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.400
Okay, okay. Here's one.

14:18.410 --> 14:22.550
First sexual experience that
was not traditional intercourse.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.380
What are we talking about here?

14:24.400 --> 14:26.130
You know what I'm talking about.

14:26.150 --> 14:28.420
Boy Scouts?

14:39.390 --> 14:40.940
What?

14:42.250 --> 14:44.620
Zing!

14:46.250 --> 14:50.550
Alan. When did you first
take your oral exams?

14:50.560 --> 14:53.280
Oh, I... I-I don't think I should say.

14:53.290 --> 14:54.710
- Why not?
- I just don't.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.340
Come on, Alan, we're all
friends. Who was it?

14:56.350 --> 14:58.620
Your wife.

14:59.890 --> 15:02.760
So, your first time doing
that was with Judith?

15:04.160 --> 15:06.640
Hey, me, too.

15:08.790 --> 15:10.960
Me, too.

15:14.590 --> 15:17.110
Just kidding-
zing, zing!

15:19.960 --> 15:23.920
What is "zing"? Is that
some type of white guy slang?

15:23.930 --> 15:24.720
Quite possibly.

15:24.750 --> 15:29.120
My barbershop quartet does a killer version
of "Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart".

15:29.130 --> 15:31.840
Real showstopper.

15:31.850 --> 15:34.500
Kind of like that story.

15:34.780 --> 15:36.570
Zing!

15:37.870 --> 15:39.990
Did I get that one right?

15:41.960 --> 15:43.800
Oh, good. Finally.

15:43.810 --> 15:46.140
- Hookers?
- Pizza.

15:46.610 --> 15:48.540
That's nice, too.

15:49.730 --> 15:51.740
- Hey, Mr. Harper.
- Oh, hey, Gordon.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.330
- It's been a long time.
- Yeah, two years.

15:54.340 --> 15:55.620
So, what you been up to?

15:55.640 --> 15:58.330
Well, I, uh... I finished night
school, got my business degree,

15:58.340 --> 16:01.720
met an amazing girl and got married,
landed a great job as a stockbroker.

16:01.730 --> 16:04.840
The company went under,
my wife left me, and, uh...

16:04.870 --> 16:07.450
that'll be $28.50

16:10.110 --> 16:13.670
Oh, man, I'm sorry. You want a drink?

16:13.680 --> 16:15.850
Why stop now?

16:16.790 --> 16:19.330
Come on in.

16:22.390 --> 16:25.700
Hey, everybody. This is
Gordon. His wife left him.

16:25.710 --> 16:28.650
- Hi, Gordon.
- Welcome to the losers lounge.

16:28.660 --> 16:29.860
Glad to be here.

16:29.870 --> 16:33.160
The topic of discussion is first
nontraditional sexual experience.

16:33.190 --> 16:35.180
Bible camp.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.370
Where do you guys want me to put these?

16:38.410 --> 16:40.900
Oh, uh, here, let me move
the snickerdoodles.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.220
Snickerdoodles.

16:43.230 --> 16:44.190
You don't like them?

16:44.220 --> 16:48.750
No, no, I do. It's just that my wife used
to call me her little snickerdoodle.

16:49.740 --> 16:52.510
- You're kidding.
- Well, no, not all of me.

16:52.520 --> 16:55.580
It was her little nickname for my, uh...

16:57.590 --> 17:00.850
Oh, that is a terrible name for a penis.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.640
Oh, yeah? What did your wife call yours?

17:03.650 --> 17:06.500
Mr. Roundtree.

17:13.130 --> 17:15.750
Richard Roundtree.

17:15.780 --> 17:18.119
The guy who played Shaft.

17:18.150 --> 17:19.910
Oh, yes.

17:19.940 --> 17:22.760
That's way better than Snickerdoodle.

17:23.680 --> 17:26.560
Judith calls mine "that thing".

17:26.930 --> 17:29.760
As in, "Get that thing away from me"?

17:30.620 --> 17:32.320
Yeah, how did you know?

17:32.330 --> 17:34.790
Just a guess.

17:36.450 --> 17:38.730
Okay. I'm out of here.

17:38.740 --> 17:39.910
Where you going?

17:39.960 --> 17:44.590
Someplace where I'm not knee-deep
in pathetic, penis-naming sad sacks.

17:46.480 --> 17:49.710
- No offense.
- None taken.

17:50.810 --> 17:53.190
Let's go, King Snake.

18:06.860 --> 18:09.470
- What do you want?
- Just listen.

18:10.620 --> 18:12.850
Rachel? Hey, it's Charlie.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.910
Look, about the pictures you sent me...

18:15.930 --> 18:18.930
No, no, no, they were very nice.

18:19.830 --> 18:22.270
Yeah, real artsy.

18:23.230 --> 18:26.830
But the thing is, I'm
kind of engaged now.

18:27.780 --> 18:33.070
I amdefinitely engaged now, so
you shouldn't send me any more.

18:33.770 --> 18:36.310
It doesn't matter who asked for them.

18:37.960 --> 18:43.200
The point is, I am no longer interested
in anyone's boobs other than my fianc?e's.

18:43.580 --> 18:46.540
No, I'm not going to send
you a picture of hers.

18:48.270 --> 18:50.350
Right?

18:50.980 --> 18:55.030
No. Okay, take care.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.980
Thank you, Charlie.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.870
I just want you to know
how much you mean to me.

18:59.890 --> 19:02.310
Did you delete the pictures?

19:03.530 --> 19:06.430
I guess there's a case
to be made for that.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.130
What are you doing? Press delete.

19:12.140 --> 19:16.120
Hang on. I'm printing them in my memory.

19:17.250 --> 19:20.960
Delete, delete, delete. Look, I'm deleting!

19:23.120 --> 19:24.990
Zing! Dear, when you smiled at me

19:25.000 --> 19:27.020
Zing!I heard a melody

19:27.070 --> 19:30.720
Zing!It haunted me from the start

19:30.730 --> 19:32.750
Zing!Something inside of me

19:32.780 --> 19:34.560
Zing!Started a symphony

19:34.590 --> 19:37.990
Zing!Went the strings of my heart

19:38.330 --> 19:40.060
Zing!'Twas like a breath of spring

19:40.100 --> 19:41.930
Zing!I heard a robin sing

19:41.960 --> 19:43.750
Zing!About a nest set apart

19:43.800 --> 19:45.710
No wonder they're all alone.

19:45.740 --> 19:47.460
Zing! All nature seemed to me

19:47.470 --> 19:49.350
Zing!In perfect harmony

19:49.390 --> 19:52.990
Zing!Went the strings of my heart...

20:02.420 --> 20:06.900
Who is the man That will
risk his neck for brother man?

20:06.910 --> 20:08.240
Shaft!

20:08.270 --> 20:11.290
Right on I heard this
cat, Shaft, is one bad mother...

20:11.340 --> 20:13.690
- Shut your mouth.
- Well, I'm talking about Shaft.

20:13.700 --> 20:14.980
Then, we can dig it.

20:15.010 --> 20:17.160
He's a complicated man...

20:17.170 --> 20:19.750
No. I can't do this.

20:20.180 --> 20:22.300
She has to take me back.
