WEBVTT

00:03.600 --> 00:04.828
WHO MADE THE APPOINTMENT, MS.

00:04.830 --> 00:05.819
TEDESCO?

00:05.830 --> 00:06.831
>> YES.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.308
>> IN THAT CASE, TELL ME WHAT

00:09.310 --> 00:11.665
YOU DON'T LIKE ABOUT YOURSELF.

00:11.670 --> 00:13.729
>> THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE.

00:13.740 --> 00:16.504
ILLANA AND I CAME HERE TO SPEAK

00:16.510 --> 00:17.841
ON BEHALF OF OUR DAUGHTERS

00:17.850 --> 00:19.738
AND TO ASK FOR YOUR HELP.

00:19.750 --> 00:22.139
>> OH? IN WHAT WAY?

00:26.760 --> 00:36.761
I SHOULD SHOW YOU HANNAH FIRST.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.761
>> HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

00:38.770 --> 00:40.499
>> A CARNIVAL RIDE.

00:40.500 --> 00:43.401
HANNAH'S PONYTAIL CAUGHT AROUND

00:43.410 --> 00:44.502
ONE OF THE GEARS WHILE IT WAS

00:44.510 --> 00:46.501
MOVING. SHE COULDN'T GET OUT OF

00:46.510 --> 00:50.276
HER SEAT, AND THE FORCE JUST...

00:50.280 --> 00:51.269
RIPPED EVERYTHING AWAY.

00:51.280 --> 00:53.271
>> AW, THAT'S AWFUL. I'M SO

00:53.280 --> 00:56.408
SORRY.

00:56.420 --> 00:58.115
>> HOW MANY GRAFI'S HAS SHE HAD

00:58.120 --> 00:59.109
SO FAR?

00:59.120 --> 01:01.657
>> 18. NO MATTER HOW MANY WE DO,

01:01.660 --> 01:03.127
EVERY DOCTOR I'VE TALKED TO SAYS

01:03.130 --> 01:04.688
SHE'LL NEVER LOOK MUCH BETTER

01:04.690 --> 01:06.897
THAN SHE DOES NOW.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.253
>> MS. MANNING, YOUR DAUGHTER

01:08.260 --> 01:09.261
WAS IN THE ACCIDENT AS WELL?

01:09.270 --> 01:12.660
>> LISA, NO. NO. SHE HAS TYPE

01:12.670 --> 01:14.797
ONE DIABETES. SHE WENT INTO A

01:14.800 --> 01:16.802
COMA 9 MONTHS AGO. SHE'S BEEN ON

01:16.810 --> 01:18.129
LIFE SUPPORT.

01:18.140 --> 01:18.902
>> ILLANA AND I MET

01:18.910 --> 01:19.877
AT THE HOSPITAL WHERE HANNAH WAS

01:19.880 --> 01:21.370
BEING TREATED.

01:21.380 --> 01:22.802
>> WE'RE BOTH SINGLE MOMS

01:22.810 --> 01:24.903
SO THE SUPPORT MEANT A LOT.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.411
AND I'M THE FIRST ONE

01:26.420 --> 01:27.819
TO BRING IT UP.

01:27.820 --> 01:30.539
>> BRING UP WHAT?

01:30.550 --> 01:31.517
>> MY DAUGHTER IS CLINICALLY

01:31.520 --> 01:33.454
BRAIN-DEAD. HER DOCTORS THINK

01:33.460 --> 01:35.155
THEY CAN KEEP HER ALIVE MAYBE

01:35.160 --> 01:37.458
ANOTHER 6 MONTHS. BUT I'VE

01:37.460 --> 01:38.449
DECIDED TO LET HER DIE WITH

01:38.460 --> 01:40.428
DIGNITY, AND I'D LIKE TO DONATE

01:40.430 --> 01:43.558
HER FACE TO HANNAH.

01:43.570 --> 01:46.289
>> I'M SORRY. DONATE HER FACE?

01:46.300 --> 01:49.167
>> YES. RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING

01:49.170 --> 01:50.432
FOR SURGEONS WHO WOULD BE

01:50.440 --> 01:52.169
WILLING TO PERFORM A FACIAL

01:52.180 --> 01:53.602
TRANSPLANT SURGERY.

01:53.610 --> 01:55.669
>> THAT PROCEDURE IS STILL ONLY

01:55.680 --> 01:59.719
THEORETICAL. A SURGEON IN ROME

01:59.720 --> 02:00.914
PERFORMED A PARTIAL SURGERY,

02:00.920 --> 02:01.739
BUT--

02:01.750 --> 02:02.717
>> ALL OF THE DOCTORS WE'VE

02:02.720 --> 02:04.187
INTERVIEWED IN EUROPE AND IN

02:04.190 --> 02:05.714
THE STATES, ALL OF THE RESEARCH

02:05.720 --> 02:06.857
WE'VE DONE OVER THE PAST 6

02:06.860 --> 02:09.727
MONTHS, PROVES THE SAME THEORY.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.322
THAT BECAUSE OF ADVENTS IN

02:11.330 --> 02:13.594
AUTOIMMUNE THERAPY, A TRANSPLANT

02:13.600 --> 02:15.192
THAT IS SUCCESSFUL IS NOW

02:15.200 --> 02:17.464
POSSIBLE. THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN

02:17.470 --> 02:18.596
FINDING SUITABLE CANDIDATES

02:18.600 --> 02:19.862
AND MATCHING THEM WITH QUALIFIED

02:19.870 --> 02:22.202
SURGEONS. NOW, HANNAH AND LISA

02:22.210 --> 02:23.859
ARE IDEAL FOR THIS. THEY HAVE

02:23.870 --> 02:26.202
SIMILAR BONE STRUCTURE, DELICATE

02:26.210 --> 02:28.599
FEATURES. AND MCNAMARA/TROY IS

02:28.610 --> 02:30.339
ONE OF THE BEST TEAMS OUT THERE.

02:30.350 --> 02:31.874
YOU WERE THE DOCTORS BRAVE

02:31.880 --> 02:33.347
ENOUGH TO PERFORM THE CONJOINED

02:33.350 --> 02:34.749
TWIN SURGERY LAST YEAR.

02:34.750 --> 02:36.479
>> YES, WE DID, BUT DR. MCNAMARA

02:36.490 --> 02:38.617
IS NO LONGER A PART OF THIS

02:38.620 --> 02:39.484
PRACTICE.

02:39.490 --> 02:40.479
>> ALTHOUGH, THANKFULLY,

02:40.490 --> 02:42.629
DR. TROY AND I HAVE CONTINUED

02:42.630 --> 02:43.756
TO BUILD ON THAT STELLAR

02:43.760 --> 02:47.218
REPUTATION.

02:47.230 --> 02:50.620
ULTIMATE SUCCESS WILL DEPEND

02:50.630 --> 02:51.892
LARGELY UPON IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE

02:51.900 --> 02:54.494
THERAPY FOLLOWING THE SURGERY.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.367
BARRING THAT, I REALLY DON'T SEE

02:57.370 --> 02:59.509
ANY REASON TO TURN DOWN THIS

02:59.510 --> 03:01.307
REQUEST.

03:05.780 --> 03:06.917
>> THERE ARE SOME ETHICAL

03:06.920 --> 03:08.239
CONSIDERATIONS.

03:08.250 --> 03:09.649
>> LIKE WHAT?

03:09.650 --> 03:11.242
>> ORGAN DONATION IS GENERALLY

03:11.250 --> 03:12.786
AN ANONYMOUS TRANSACTION.

03:12.790 --> 03:14.382
REMOVING YOUR DAUGHTER'S FACE,

03:14.390 --> 03:15.914
HER IDENTITY, AND TRANSFERRING

03:15.920 --> 03:17.649
IT TO A RELATIVE STRANGER COULD

03:17.660 --> 03:19.799
BE A DISASTER FOR YOU BOTH,

03:19.800 --> 03:20.789
LET ALONE HANNAH.

03:20.800 --> 03:21.789
>> MY DAUGHTER'S IDENTITY,

03:21.800 --> 03:25.258
DOCTOR, WAS HER SPIRIT, WHICH IS

03:25.270 --> 03:28.660
NOW GONE. SHE CAN'T GO OUT IN

03:28.670 --> 03:30.934
PUBLIC. PEOPLE STARE. THEY MAKE

03:30.940 --> 03:33.807
FUN. [SOBBING] MY DAUGHTER HAD

03:33.810 --> 03:36.404
SUCH CONFIDENCE, YOU KNOW. THIS

03:36.410 --> 03:37.946
IS THE ONLY WAY FOR HER TO GET

03:37.950 --> 03:40.942
BACK WHAT SHE'S LOST.

03:40.950 --> 03:42.417
>> 50 YEARS AGO, PEOPLE THOUGHT

03:42.420 --> 03:44.285
THAT KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS WERE

03:44.290 --> 03:46.281
IMMORAL. MY DAUGHTER WENT INTO

03:46.290 --> 03:47.689
A COMA WAITING FOR A TRANSPLANT

03:47.690 --> 03:48.952
BECAUSE TOO MANY PEOPLE STILL

03:49.960 --> 03:52.690
>> I UNDERSTAND, BUT DONATING

03:52.700 --> 03:54.691
A KIDNEY IS ABOUT SAVING A LIFE.

03:54.700 --> 03:55.826
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS VERY

03:55.830 --> 03:57.821
DIFFERENT. THE RISKS INVOLVED IN

03:57.830 --> 03:58.967
WHAT IS BASICALLY AN ELECT IVE

03:58.970 --> 04:00.289
SURGERY--

04:00.300 --> 04:01.699
>> THIS IS ABOUT SAVING A LIFE,

04:01.700 --> 04:05.704
DR. TROY. BEFORE THE ACCIDENT

04:05.710 --> 04:07.439
HANNAH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL WITH

04:07.440 --> 04:09.704
A BRIGHT FUTURE. THIS IS

04:09.710 --> 04:11.974
THE ONLY WAY FOR HER TO LOOK AND

04:11.980 --> 04:14.972
FEEL AND LIVE LIKE A NORMAL

04:14.980 --> 04:18.438
PERSON AGAIN. PLEASE, GIVE HER

04:18.450 --> 04:19.917
THAT CHANCE.

05:25.820 --> 05:26.809
>> THAT WAS MY FIRST GOOD

05:26.820 --> 05:29.084
NIGHT'S SLEEP IN...

05:29.090 --> 05:32.423
I DON'T REMEMBER.

05:32.430 --> 05:34.091
IS THERE MORE COFFEE?

05:38.570 --> 05:40.834
WHAT DO YOU THINK SMELLS BE'ITER?

05:40.840 --> 05:42.432
LATE AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORM

05:42.440 --> 05:44.965
OR THAT FIRST CUP OF COFFEE

05:44.970 --> 05:46.437
IN THE MORNING?

05:46.440 --> 05:48.772
>> DID YOU KILL YOUR HUSBAND?

05:52.110 --> 05:53.839
>> WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME THAT?

05:53.850 --> 05:54.976
>> I CAN'T HAVE ANY MORE

05:54.980 --> 05:56.584
DISHONESTY IN THIS HOUSE, NIKKI.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.841
I DEALT WITH THAT IN MY MARRIAGE

05:57.850 --> 05:58.987
AND MY BUSINESS. I NEED TO HEAR

05:58.990 --> 06:01.584
THE TRUTH FROM YOU. DID YOU KILL

06:01.590 --> 06:02.784
YOUR HUSBAND?

06:06.860 --> 06:07.599
>> WHERE IS ALL THIS

06:07.600 --> 06:08.726
COMING FROM?

06:08.730 --> 06:10.869
>> I TALKED TO SAGAMORE.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.134
HE TOLD ME EVERYTHING. HOW YOU

06:13.140 --> 06:14.732
GOT YOUR HUSBAND DRUNK, THEN

06:14.740 --> 06:15.991
SHOT HIM IN THE HEAD. THAT'S

06:16.000 --> 06:17.467
PREMEDITATED MURDER.

06:17.470 --> 06:21.600
>> OHH! YOU...YOU HAVE BEEN LIED

06:21.610 --> 06:24.078
TO, SEAN.

06:30.620 --> 06:32.485
VIC FOUND OUT THAT I WAS TALKING

06:32.490 --> 06:38.156
TO THE FBI. HE DRAGGED ME OUT OF

06:38.160 --> 06:41.493
BED AND TRIED TO KILL ME.

06:41.500 --> 06:46.893
HE USED HIS FISTS, A CHAIR.

06:46.900 --> 06:49.039
I MANAGED TO BREAK FREE LONG

06:49.040 --> 06:50.769
ENOUGH TO GRAB ONE OF THE GUNS

06:50.770 --> 06:54.900
HE HAS IN HIS NIGHTSTAND.

06:54.910 --> 06:57.049
EVEN THEN I DIDN'T WANT TO SHOOT

06:57.050 --> 07:01.919
HIM. I JUST ASKED HIM TO LEAVE.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.184
HE CAME AT ME AND I PULLED

07:04.190 --> 07:07.182
THE TRIGGER.

07:07.190 --> 07:08.179
>> IF IT WAS REALLY

07:08.190 --> 07:09.179
SELF-DEFENSE, WHY DIDN'T YOU

07:09.190 --> 07:11.181
JUST TELL ME? YOU TRUSTED ME

07:11.190 --> 07:12.919
ENOUGH TO COME HOME WITH ME.

07:12.930 --> 07:15.057
TO BRING YOUR SON IN MY HOUSE.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.527
TO SLEEP IN MY BED. WAS THAT ALL

07:16.530 --> 07:18.919
JUST A LIE, TOO?

07:18.930 --> 07:20.192
>> DOES IT REALLY FEEL THAT WAY

07:20.200 --> 07:23.203
TO YOU?

07:23.210 --> 07:25.929
I'M SORRY. I WANTED THINGS TO

07:25.940 --> 07:30.673
WORK SO BAD. THE THREE OF US.

07:30.680 --> 07:32.819
I LIKED THINKING ABOUT A FUTURE

07:32.820 --> 07:36.074
TOGETHER.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.889
>> YOU DO?

07:43.230 --> 07:44.219
I'VE SORT OF FELT THE SAME

07:44.230 --> 07:47.893
THING. ABOUT THE THREE OF US.

07:52.230 --> 07:56.098
>> YOU JUST LIKE MY COOKING.

07:56.100 --> 08:00.104
>> SORRY, HONEY, YOUR COOKING

08:00.110 --> 08:02.032
AIN'T THAT HOT.

08:06.980 --> 08:08.914
BUT YOU ARE.

08:14.120 --> 08:17.851

THERE'S HOPE HERE?

08:21.600 --> 08:23.124

11:12.030 --> 11:12.997
YOU PROBABLY DON'T HAVE THIS

PROBLEM, BUT MARK AND I HAVE

11:14.800 --> 11:17.769
BEEN TOGETHER ALMOST 10 YEARS,

11:17.770 --> 11:18.907
AND THE SEX GETS A LITTLE

11:18.910 --> 11:20.935
ROUTINE. SO I BOUGHT THE DOLL TO

11:20.940 --> 11:23.170
SPICE THINGS UP. MARK FLIPPED.

11:23.180 --> 11:24.408
HE LOVED TO TWIST HER IN ALL

11:24.410 --> 11:25.877
THESE CRAZY POSITIONS, AND DRESS

11:25.880 --> 11:27.313
HER UP IN LINGERIE, AND DO US

11:27.320 --> 11:28.776
BOTH AT THE SAME TIME.

11:29.450 --> 11:30.917
MRS. EUBANKS?

11:30.920 --> 11:34.185

11:34.190 --> 11:35.919
MARK STOPPED HAVING SEX WITH ME

11:35.920 --> 11:37.182
AND WOULD ONLY GET OFF WITH THE

11:37.190 --> 11:40.318
DOLL. SOMETIMES 4 TIMES A DAY.

11:40.330 --> 11:42.321
I KNOW THIS SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT IF

11:42.330 --> 11:43.467
I DON'T CHANGE SOMETHING NOW,

11:43.470 --> 11:44.926
I'M GONNA LOSE HIM.

THAN THE MAN WHO SLEEPS WITH

12:04.820 --> 12:06.344

12:06.350 --> 12:07.351
>> LET ME SAVE YOU A LOT OF

MONEY, OK? THROW THE DOLL AWAY

12:09.960 --> 12:10.949
WHEN YOUR HUSBAND'S NOT HOME.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.222
THAT WAY, HE HAS TO SLEEP

12:12.230 --> 12:13.094
WITH YOU.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.351

24:21.290 --> 24:22.279
THE FEELING YOU WEREN'T GONNA DO

24:22.290 --> 24:24.155
THE WORK. THEN I FIGURED, WHY

24:24.160 --> 24:26.151
NOT GO STRAIGHT TO THE SOURCE?

24:26.160 --> 24:27.149
>> WE TALKED ALL ABOUT

24:27.160 --> 24:28.149
THE PROBLEM WITH HER HUSBAND,

24:28.160 --> 24:31.618
AND I FELT SO BAD. BUT THEN I

24:31.630 --> 24:32.892
HAD A GREAT IDEA.

24:32.900 --> 24:33.764
>> AND YOU WERE RIGHT,

24:33.770 --> 24:34.759
BY THE WAY. SURGERY WAS WAY

24:34.770 --> 24:35.634
TOO EXTREME.

24:35.640 --> 24:36.891
>> ALL MEN REALLY WANT IS THE

24:36.900 --> 24:38.162
FANTASY, RIGHT. IT'S WHY THE

24:38.170 --> 24:40.161
DOLL WORKS. SO I THOUGHT I WOULD

24:40.170 --> 24:41.899
GIVE COLLEEN A FEW TIPS ON HOW

24:41.910 --> 24:46.904
TO BE KIMBER. LIKE THE WALK...

24:46.910 --> 24:49.777
THE POUTY FACE...

24:49.780 --> 24:51.645
HOW TO PUSH YOUR TITS UP 50--

24:51.650 --> 24:53.311
> > STOP IT!

24:53.320 --> 24:56.187
THIS IS RIDICULOUS. I'M TIRED,

24:56.190 --> 24:57.316
AND I NEED TO PREPARE FOR

24:57.320 --> 24:58.651
SURGERY. I DON'T NEED TO DEAL

24:58.660 --> 24:59.319
WITH ANY OF THIS FRIVOLOUS

24:59.330 --> 25:01.924
BULLSHIT. AND GET OUT OF MY

25:01.930 --> 25:03.056
APARTMENT. AND WHEN YOU GO HOME

25:03.060 --> 25:04.322
YOU TELL YOUR HUSBAND THAT YOU

25:04.330 --> 25:05.922
BOTH NEED TO GO TO THERAPY. GO.

25:05.930 --> 25:08.194
GO!

25:08.200 --> 25:11.806
[DOOR OPENS, SLAMS SHUT]

25:11.810 --> 25:12.799
I DON'T WANT YOU DOING THIS

25:12.810 --> 25:13.674
ANYMORE.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.806
>> YOU COULD'VE TOLD ME

25:14.810 --> 25:16.209
IN PRIVATE. MAYBE SPARED

25:16.210 --> 25:17.677
THE POOR GIRL HER FEELINGS.

25:17.680 --> 25:18.669
>> NO, NO, NO. I MEAN, I DON'T

25:18.680 --> 25:19.669
WANT YOU IN THE PORN BUSINESS

25:19.680 --> 25:22.069
ANYMORE. PERIOD. AND I WANT YOU

25:22.080 --> 25:23.684
TO STOP SELLING THOSE DOLLS.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.214
DO YOU REALIZE HOW MANY MEN

25:25.220 --> 25:27.688
ARE BONING YOU RIGHT NOW? I WENT

25:27.690 --> 25:28.679
ONLINE. HUNDREDS OF THOSE THINGS

25:28.690 --> 25:29.679
HAVE BEEN SOLD.

25:29.690 --> 25:33.080
>> 1,238. EACH SALE IS $8,000

25:33.090 --> 25:34.819
IN MY POCKET, BY THE WAY.

25:34.830 --> 25:36.092
>> WELL, NOW WE'RE GETTING

MARRIED, YOU DON'T NEED

25:37.100 --> 25:37.964
THE MONEY.

25:37.970 --> 25:38.959
>> BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY,

25:38.970 --> 25:41.689
CHRISTIAN. THIS--THIS IS ABOUT

25:41.700 --> 25:42.689
MY CAREER.

25:42.700 --> 25:45.362
>> [SCOFFS] HOW WOULD YOU FEEL

25:45.370 --> 25:47.099
IF I TOOK A MOLD OF MY COCK,

25:47.110 --> 25:48.702
PASSED IT AROUND SOUTH BEACH

25:48.710 --> 25:51.304
AND CALLED IT A CAREER?

25:51.310 --> 25:53.005
>> IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS A SOLID

25:53.010 --> 25:54.272
BUSINESS VENTURE, I WOULD LET

25:54.280 --> 25:55.247
YOU.

25:55.250 --> 25:58.117

ME WOULDN'T BOTHER YOU?

26:10.360 --> 26:11.327
>> I WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM

26:11.330 --> 26:15.391
WITH WOMEN OBJECTIFYING YOU.

26:15.400 --> 26:16.298
>> PLEASE.

26:16.300 --> 26:17.733

26:17.740 --> 26:19.662
I SEE YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE.

26:19.670 --> 26:21.137
I THINK THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT

26:21.140 --> 26:23.370
YOU DON'T SEE ME. I'M NOT

26:23.380 --> 26:25.268
A DOLL, CHRISTIAN. I'M NOT GONNA

CHANCE THAT YOU WERE AVOIDING

MY CALLS.

>> MCNAMARA/TROY ISN'T MY LIFE

28:13.350 --> 28:15.215
ANYMORE. I CAN'T JUST RUN INTO

28:15.220 --> 28:17.085
SURGERY AND ASSIST. I'M IN THE

MIDDLE OF PACKING UP MY HOME.

>> AND QUENTIN AND I ARE IN THE

28:19.230 --> 28:21.152
MIDDLE OF A FACIAL TRANSPLANT.

28:23.830 --> 28:25.366
WE ALREADY REMOVED THE DONOR

28:25.370 --> 28:27.099
TISSUE. WE'RE OPERATING IN LESS

28:27.100 --> 28:28.237
THAN AN HOUR.

28:32.370 --> 28:34.179
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

COME ON, SEAN. I'M NOT ASKING

28:40.250 --> 28:41.842
YOU TO REJOIN THE PRACTICE,

28:41.850 --> 28:42.976
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

28:42.980 --> 28:44.516
>> I KNOW THIS IS HARD FOR YOU,

28:44.520 --> 28:46.511
CHRISTIAN. I'VE BEEN EITHER AT

28:46.520 --> 28:47.987
YOUR SIDE OR IN THE NEXT ROOM

28:47.990 --> 28:49.855
FOR EVERY ONE OF YOUR SURGERIES,

28:49.860 --> 28:51.521
BUT YOU NEED TO GET USED TO

28:51.530 --> 28:52.986
HAVING AN IDENTITY AS A DOCTOR

28:52.990 --> 28:54.992
WITHOUT ME. QUENTIN IS

28:55.000 --> 28:56.524
COMPLETELY CAPABLE. MORE CAPABLE

28:56.530 --> 28:57.861
THAN I AM FOR THIS SURGERY,

28:57.870 --> 28:58.859
AS A MATTER OF FACT.

28:58.870 --> 29:01.998
>> QUENTIN IS ON DRUGS.

29:02.000 --> 29:02.989
HE WAS HIGH THE WHOLE WAY

29:03.000 --> 29:04.262
THROUGH THE FIRST SURGERY.

29:04.270 --> 29:06.409
HE WAS JUMPY, SWEATING BULLETS.

29:06.410 --> 29:08.002
>> MAYBE HE WAS JUST NERVOUS.

29:08.010 --> 29:09.534
>> [SIGHS] I'VE DONE A LOT OF

29:09.540 --> 29:11.872
BLOW IN MY DAY, SEAN. I KNOW THE

29:11.880 --> 29:13.279
SYMPTOMS WHEN SOMEBODY'S DOING

29:13.280 --> 29:17.546
TOO MUCH.

29:17.550 --> 29:20.883
OK, LOOK. THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

29:20.890 --> 29:23.154
IT'S ABOUT A PATIENT. A YOUNG

29:23.160 --> 29:25.287
GIRL. SHE DESERVES TO BE MORE

29:25.290 --> 29:27.895
THAN JUST A FAILED EGO-DRIVEN

29:27.900 --> 29:29.151
EXPERIMENT WRITTEN UP IN MEDICAL

29:29.160 --> 29:32.163
JOURNALS. YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER.

29:32.170 --> 29:33.569
THINK OF IT FROM HER MOTHER'S

PERSPECTIVE.

>> NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

30:10.240 --> 30:12.435
>> I ASKED HIM TO ASSIST.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.032
SEAN HAS THE MOST EXPERIENCE

30:14.040 --> 30:15.439
WHEN IT COMES TO MICRO-VASCULAR

30:15.440 --> 30:17.908
ANASTOMOSIS. WE REALLY SHOULD

30:17.910 --> 30:19.309
NEVER HAVE ATTEMPTED THIS

30:19.310 --> 30:20.174
WITHOUT HIM.

30:20.180 --> 30:23.308
>> THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT?

30:23.320 --> 30:25.311
WELL, I APPRECIATE THE VOTE OF

30:25.320 --> 30:27.447
CONFIDENCE, CHRISTIAN, BUT I

30:27.450 --> 30:29.054
TOLD YOU, I AM NOT GONNA LET

30:29.060 --> 30:30.186

30:32.060 --> 30:33.186
PERMISSION, QUENTIN. THIS IS

30:33.190 --> 30:34.191
STILL MY PRACTICE.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.326
>> THAT I'VE BEEN RUNNING WHILE

30:38.470 --> 30:39.459
>> WE'RE NOT GONNA ARGUE WITH

30:39.470 --> 30:41.597
YOU, QUENTIN. WE'RE DOING WHAT'S

30:41.600 --> 30:45.604
BEST FOR THE PATIENT.

30:45.610 --> 30:47.202
>> THINGS WENT SO WELL EARLIER,

30:47.210 --> 30:48.199
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO BLOW THIS

30:48.210 --> 30:48.938
NOW?

30:48.940 --> 30:50.077
>> SPEAKING OF BLOW, WHY WERE

30:50.080 --> 30:52.207
YOU SO JUMPY THIS AI-TERNOON?

30:52.210 --> 30:54.940

30:54.950 --> 30:56.474
>> I KNOW WHAT COCAINE ABUSE

31:01.920 --> 31:02.614
LICENSE, WE'D GET SUED FOR

31:02.620 --> 31:03.609

SINGLE-HANDEDLY DESTROY WHAT'S

31:04.630 --> 31:07.224
LEI-T OF THIS PRACTICE.

31:07.230 --> 31:09.494
>> I SEE. YEAH, I SEE WHAT'S

31:09.500 --> 31:11.968
GOING ON HERE. I BRING IN A

31:11.970 --> 31:13.221
SURGICAL PROCEDURE THAT CAN

31:13.230 --> 31:14.492
RE-INVENT THIS PRACTICE IN AN

31:14.500 --> 31:16.365
UNPRECEDENTED WAY AND YOU GUYS

REPUTATION AND TAKE ALL THE

31:18.640 --> 31:20.039
CREDIT FOR YOURSELF, IS THAT IT?

31:20.040 --> 31:21.109
THAT'S BULLSHIT, AND IT'S NOT

31:21.110 --> 31:21.633
GONNA WORK.
