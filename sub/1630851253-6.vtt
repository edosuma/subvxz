00:10.958 --> 00:12.750
[waves splashing]

00:35.625 --> 00:36.708
[sniffles]

01:01.958 --> 01:02.791
[sniffles]

01:08.875 --> 01:09.875
[exhales]

01:12.750 --> 01:13.750
[sniffles]

01:27.708 --> 01:29.708
[eerie music playing]

01:38.208 --> 01:39.750
[rustling]

01:59.791 --> 02:01.000
[inhales sharply]

02:14.875 --> 02:15.791
[thuds]

03:13.291 --> 03:14.291
Shit.

03:17.333 --> 03:18.291
[sniffs]

03:25.166 --> 03:26.791
[knocking at door]

03:38.208 --> 03:39.041
[Sarah] Erin.

03:41.625 --> 03:42.625
I need your help.

03:44.666 --> 03:46.083
And now you think I'm crazy.

03:47.666 --> 03:52.000
Because I just heard that come out
of my mouth, and I think I'm crazy.

03:54.583 --> 03:55.416
Yeah.

03:58.333 --> 04:00.750
It sounds crazy.

04:05.666 --> 04:07.041
Have you ever heard of…

04:11.166 --> 04:13.000
Ignaz Semmelweis?

04:18.583 --> 04:19.541
No.

04:19.625 --> 04:22.250
[Sarah] He was a Hungarian physician
in the 1840s.

04:22.750 --> 04:25.208
Finds himself in charge
of two maternity wards.

04:25.791 --> 04:27.916
One was a teaching school,
best and brightest,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.250
birthing to autopsies,
everything in between.

04:30.791 --> 04:34.166
The second was a clinic for women
who couldn't afford medical care.

04:34.791 --> 04:37.125
Wasn't even run by doctors.
It was midwives.

04:37.833 --> 04:41.375
No surprise that one clinic had
a higher mortality rate than the other.

04:41.875 --> 04:43.166
The surprise was which one.

04:43.916 --> 04:45.250
It was the first one.

04:45.333 --> 04:48.416
The teaching school.
Death rate was staggering.

04:48.916 --> 04:51.708
Women had a better chance of living
giving birth on the streets.

04:52.291 --> 04:55.875
But it didn't make any sense,
and it drove him nuts.

04:56.541 --> 05:00.208
He did study after study after study,
and beat his head into the wall,

05:00.291 --> 05:02.416
until finally, he suggested that
[inhales deeply]

05:02.500 --> 05:05.083
maybe, just maybe for no reason
that made any sense,

05:06.166 --> 05:08.083
maybe his students
should wash their hands.

05:08.750 --> 05:12.125
After performing the autopsies.
Before going into the birthing ward.

05:12.666 --> 05:15.250
So he started
a mandatory chlorine hand wash.

05:15.333 --> 05:17.208
Lo and behold, death rates plummeted.

05:18.916 --> 05:21.416
And the scientific community
ate him alive.

05:22.916 --> 05:25.541
Germ theory was
two decades away from acceptance.

05:25.625 --> 05:29.791
Ideas in that direction were met
with disdain, ridicule, exile.

05:29.875 --> 05:33.416
Semmelweis was committed
to an asylum. An asylum.

05:34.583 --> 05:35.916
By another scientist.

05:36.541 --> 05:37.708
In fact, he died there.

05:38.291 --> 05:40.541
Oh, and when they replaced him
at these clinics,

05:40.625 --> 05:42.958
got rid of that crazy, silly hand wash?

05:43.541 --> 05:45.458
Mortality rates went back up again.

05:46.875 --> 05:49.583
So, yeah, Erin, your story is crazy.

05:53.541 --> 05:56.083
Let me tell you something crazy
while we're at it.

05:57.333 --> 05:58.166
I mean…

05:59.375 --> 06:01.791
What's a little crazy
between friends, right?

06:04.041 --> 06:06.125
So my mom has made a recovery that is…

06:06.208 --> 06:09.000
"Unprecedented" doesn't
quite seem to cover it.

06:09.083 --> 06:11.791
And I've been trying to
understand it quietly for now,

06:11.875 --> 06:14.875
because if I told anyone
in the medical community what I'm seeing,

06:14.958 --> 06:16.583
they would think that I'm crazy.

06:17.875 --> 06:19.416
They would think I'm fucking insane.

06:20.041 --> 06:22.166
So I've been running tests. Lots of tests.

06:22.250 --> 06:25.791
Which means taking blood
to send to the mainland for analysis,

06:25.875 --> 06:28.750
but I haven't sent them yet,
because I keep doing this.

06:29.458 --> 06:30.625
Just to see it again.

06:31.583 --> 06:32.958
That's the thing about science.

06:33.500 --> 06:36.666
It deals in what is observable.
Testable. Repeatable.

06:38.208 --> 06:41.791
You're telling me today that Riley Flynn
caught fire in the sunlight?

06:42.583 --> 06:43.541
That's right.

06:43.625 --> 06:45.541
He literally combusted in the sun?

06:50.666 --> 06:52.208
You're right, Erin. That's crazy.

06:52.958 --> 06:58.583
That is batshit, hold-the-phone,
padded-room, clozapine insane.

06:58.666 --> 07:00.916
-[sizzling]
-[eerie music playing]

07:04.125 --> 07:05.458
Fucking bonkers.

07:06.375 --> 07:08.541
[smoke detector beeping]

07:14.000 --> 07:15.458
[Mildred] Jesus!

07:15.541 --> 07:17.125
What are you doing in there?

07:17.208 --> 07:21.291
Not a day goes by lately without you
setting off the… smoke alarm.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.166
Yeah, Mom.

07:25.041 --> 07:26.666
-I'm nuts.
-[Mildred sighs]

07:26.750 --> 07:28.791
Fit for the asylum, all of us.

07:28.875 --> 07:29.958
[laughs weakly]

07:36.541 --> 07:40.083
Monsignor, you have got to be careful.

07:40.708 --> 07:42.958
These curtains are wide open.

07:43.041 --> 07:44.125
[Father Paul] He's gone.

07:46.541 --> 07:49.083
I'm not sure how I can tell.
[inhales deeply]

07:49.166 --> 07:54.750
Uh, maybe the same way I could tell
that Leeza could walk, I suppose.

07:54.833 --> 07:58.750
Same way…
I can hear the voice of the angel.

07:58.833 --> 08:01.041
The sun came up and I could just tell.

08:03.583 --> 08:04.416
He's gone.

08:06.541 --> 08:08.500
-I'm sorry.
-It was a gift. It's a gift.

08:09.916 --> 08:10.875
He spat it out.

08:13.083 --> 08:17.375
"For the wages of sin is death.
But the gift of God is eternal life

08:17.458 --> 08:20.875
in Jesus Christ, Our Lord." Free will.

08:21.666 --> 08:26.958
The heartbreak you feel at his choice…
How must God feel for the world?

08:27.041 --> 08:28.041
Yeah.

08:29.416 --> 08:32.166
I'm sorry that Riley chose what he chose.

08:33.208 --> 08:36.916
It breaks your heart,
but that isn't the worst part, is it?

08:38.000 --> 08:41.708
It's that some people aren't content
to ruin it for themselves.

08:41.791 --> 08:45.458
They have to poison it
for others, as well.

08:45.541 --> 08:48.916
I'm sorry to have to say this,
sorry to have to think this way,

08:49.000 --> 08:52.041
but the world is the world,
and we have to be smart about this.

08:52.125 --> 08:55.291
"As wise as serpents,
as innocent as doves," He said.

08:59.875 --> 09:04.083
Who knows who he talked to all night.

09:05.833 --> 09:09.250
Who knows what else he has done

09:09.333 --> 09:13.125
to deprive others of God's graces.

09:14.166 --> 09:16.916
Judas was part of God's plan too.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.458
Judas was part of it.

09:22.375 --> 09:24.125
The Acts of the Apostles.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.666
When those brave early followers
were sent out into the world

09:28.750 --> 09:33.458
as sheep among wolves, "All the believers
were of one heart and mind."

09:33.541 --> 09:36.958
"No one claimed that any
of their possessions were their own,

09:37.041 --> 09:39.916
but they shared everything that they had."

09:42.041 --> 09:45.125
There will be others like Riley.
There always are.

09:45.208 --> 09:50.041
Who try to poison the ears
of the faithful against their God.

09:51.583 --> 09:53.041
But tonight,

09:54.791 --> 10:01.708
let's have faith in our church.
Let's share everything that we have.

10:03.291 --> 10:04.333
[inhales]

10:04.875 --> 10:08.916
Easter Vigil has always been
a night of baptism.

10:10.333 --> 10:11.208
Hasn't it?

10:14.833 --> 10:19.958
[Sarah] So there's a blood disorder
called erythropoietic protoporphyria. EPP.

10:20.041 --> 10:24.250
A lot of those myths
probably came from EPP.

10:24.333 --> 10:27.041
People with it
are extremely sensitive to light,

10:27.125 --> 10:31.541
to the point of burning and blistering
in the sun. And very anemic.

10:31.625 --> 10:33.125
So this is a blood disorder?

10:33.208 --> 10:34.875
Not this. No.

10:35.750 --> 10:38.000
But in the same family maybe.

10:38.666 --> 10:41.000
Kind of like the common cold

10:41.083 --> 10:44.166
and the bubonic plague
are in the same family.

10:44.958 --> 10:47.791
Say something has been ingested
by people on this island.

10:47.875 --> 10:51.833
A virus. An enzyme. A new type of cell.

10:52.625 --> 10:55.000
Some kind of parasite. Who knows?

10:55.083 --> 10:57.791
Something that repairs damaged cells,

10:57.875 --> 11:02.125
is violently photosensitive,
and causes an insane anemia.

11:02.208 --> 11:05.250
A desperate hunger for iron.
Iron in blood.

11:05.333 --> 11:08.666
At first, this thing in the blood
is only present in trace amounts.

11:09.166 --> 11:13.208
But as that ratio increases,
the physical alterations become

11:14.041 --> 11:15.583
more pronounced.

11:17.125 --> 11:21.291
Mom, when I put your blood in the sun,
and yours too, Erin,

11:22.250 --> 11:26.791
this thing burns away,
leaving your normal blood behind.

11:26.875 --> 11:27.875
My blood?

11:28.750 --> 11:30.083
Yours too.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.416
I took the blood sample after the…

11:34.958 --> 11:37.625
And I bet
if I'd take Leeza Scarborough's blood

11:37.708 --> 11:39.958
after she could walk again,
it would be the same.

11:40.750 --> 11:45.041
But with both of you,
your blood is still mostly normal blood,

11:45.125 --> 11:48.041
made up of typical,
boring old red blood cells.

11:48.125 --> 11:53.333
But with Riley, perhaps he had
more of it in his bloodstream,

11:53.416 --> 11:56.333
so that when the ultraviolet rays
penetrated his skin,

11:57.041 --> 12:01.041
the blood,
now predominantly this thing, ignited.

12:02.458 --> 12:03.500
This thing?

12:05.125 --> 12:06.291
If you ingest it…

12:09.708 --> 12:11.666
What would happen if you were pregnant?

12:14.291 --> 12:16.500
-What happens then?
-[Sarah sighs]

12:19.958 --> 12:23.750
Hypothetically, a pregnancy is
an alien presence in a human body.

12:23.833 --> 12:26.875
A lot of processes occur
to stop a mother's body

12:26.958 --> 12:30.000
from attacking a fetus in the womb.
And even then, sometimes…

12:32.458 --> 12:38.291
But hypothetically, given how aggressively
this thing alters the body,

12:39.708 --> 12:42.625
its response to a fetus
could be equally aggressive.

12:48.041 --> 12:49.041
[sniffles]

12:54.458 --> 12:55.541
Could you stop it?

12:56.625 --> 12:59.166
If most of your blood was still yours?

13:00.208 --> 13:01.708
Could you stop the process?

13:03.458 --> 13:05.958
[Sarah] I don't know. I have no idea.

13:06.666 --> 13:10.041
I think when we ingest
poison, alcohol, whatever,

13:10.125 --> 13:13.125
before a certain point,
if we stop taking it in,

13:14.583 --> 13:16.958
maybe our body can push it back out.

13:17.041 --> 13:20.750
Filter it out, the way it does any other
harmful substance, if it's not too much.

13:22.083 --> 13:24.833
I mean, that's what I want to think.

13:26.875 --> 13:29.583
Honestly, Mom,
I don't have a fucking clue.

13:31.041 --> 13:32.250
All right.

13:32.958 --> 13:35.250
[inhales deeply]

13:35.333 --> 13:36.208
All right.

13:38.791 --> 13:40.666
-Where do we go from here?
-[Sarah sighs]

13:43.541 --> 13:44.583
[Erin] Riley.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.166
I'm trying to remember
exactly what he said at the end.

13:48.250 --> 13:50.250
But I can't remember it all,
not perfectly.

13:50.333 --> 13:54.500
But I do remember one thing pretty well.

13:57.166 --> 13:58.250
He said to run.

14:19.250 --> 14:20.208
Hello?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.250
[Bev] Ed Flynn! Good morning to ya.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.708
Hi there. You mind if I…

14:35.125 --> 14:36.208
Oh.

14:37.125 --> 14:38.333
Sorry to interrupt.

14:38.416 --> 14:41.208
[Bev] Oh, it's nothing.
We're just getting ready for tonight.

14:41.291 --> 14:42.541
[Dolly sniffling]

14:44.083 --> 14:45.291
You all right, Dolly?

14:46.375 --> 14:47.375
[sniffles]

14:47.458 --> 14:49.250
Uh, what can we do for you, Ed?

14:49.333 --> 14:50.875
[ominous music playing]

14:53.166 --> 14:55.916
Would you mind if we maybe take a walk?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
It's a bit private, what I have to say.

15:02.083 --> 15:05.833
-Actually--
-We were headed out already.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.458
A lot to get done today, it turns out.

15:10.416 --> 15:11.541
Leave you to it.

15:14.916 --> 15:15.833
-[Ed] Dolly.
-[Wade] Ed.

15:15.916 --> 15:16.791
[Ed] Wade.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.125
-Ed.
-Sturge.

15:20.708 --> 15:21.875
God bless you, Ed.

15:24.791 --> 15:25.625
See you tonight.

15:28.416 --> 15:30.708
-[Ed] Sorry to interrupt, like I said.
-Not at all.

15:33.416 --> 15:36.916
I don't really know how to say this,
so I'll just come out and say it.

15:40.458 --> 15:46.375
My son. You've been what?
Getting him to… write letters?

15:47.625 --> 15:49.500
-Making amends?
-Yeah.

15:50.166 --> 15:54.916
Yeah. Part of his recovery, making amends.
We're working on that.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.625
[Ed smacks lips] Well…

15:58.291 --> 15:59.666
I don't think he's well.

16:01.625 --> 16:02.625
[sighs]

16:03.500 --> 16:07.166
It's no surprise to you
or me or anybody else, but…

16:08.750 --> 16:10.125
So he wrote some letters.

16:10.791 --> 16:12.458
Uh, to me, his mother.

16:13.625 --> 16:16.916
And I read mine first
and it was unsettling.

16:18.125 --> 16:20.958
[smacks lips] Then I read Annie's
and hers was…

16:22.458 --> 16:23.458
[exhales sharply]

16:24.375 --> 16:26.333
He isn't well, clearly.

16:27.458 --> 16:29.041
[sighs] I mean, this stuff, it's…

16:31.166 --> 16:33.875
crazy stuff. Delusional stuff.

16:35.625 --> 16:38.291
And I don't know where he is.
I don't know where to look.

16:39.208 --> 16:42.041
I don't know where to go.
I can't go to the sheriff.

16:42.125 --> 16:44.375
I mean, if he's in a bad way

16:44.458 --> 16:46.916
and it's my phone call
that sends in the law,

16:47.000 --> 16:50.500
and he's gotta go back. I mean,
he's gotta go back to where he's been,

16:51.333 --> 16:54.583
and it's me that helps
send him there… [sighs]

16:55.958 --> 16:57.458
You've been spending time with him.

16:58.125 --> 17:00.916
And I thought you'd be the one to ask.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.375
I think… [sighs]

17:05.166 --> 17:07.583
I think he may have
done something to himself.

17:09.083 --> 17:12.875
These letters seem as much
like a goodbye as I've ever heard.

17:13.958 --> 17:16.458
[sighs] And I had
to ask you about it because

17:17.750 --> 17:22.208
whatever delusions he had,
he put you in the middle of 'em.

17:23.541 --> 17:25.708
He said some crazy stuff about you.

17:29.041 --> 17:31.500
Um, I'm so sorry about that, Ed.

17:34.166 --> 17:36.041
Uh, yes, the answer is yes.

17:38.250 --> 17:40.041
Riley wasn't well. Isn't well.

17:43.333 --> 17:44.583
Okay.

17:45.458 --> 17:47.041
[sobbing]

17:50.041 --> 17:52.833
Oh, come on. Ed, I don't want
to make you feel like that.

17:55.166 --> 17:56.375
Will you please believe me?

17:56.875 --> 18:00.916
I just never,
never could do it with him. I…

18:02.250 --> 18:05.208
It's like we spoke
different languages sometimes and I…

18:10.166 --> 18:11.166
I did my best.

18:12.208 --> 18:14.250
[Father Paul] Well, we don't know, Ed. We…

18:15.416 --> 18:16.833
Uh, maybe he's on a bender.

18:16.916 --> 18:19.333
Maybe he's taken the ferry
to the mainland.

18:19.416 --> 18:22.041
He's just in a bad place.
Don't assume the worst.

18:22.125 --> 18:24.416
In fact, hey, assume the best.

18:25.958 --> 18:28.458
That's what God teaches us
about being parents.

18:30.291 --> 18:32.000
Do as he does.

18:33.291 --> 18:36.291
You love your son as God loves us.
Assume the best.

18:39.791 --> 18:42.791
Do you want…
Do you want me to take the letters,

18:42.875 --> 18:45.833
uh, just to see if it sparks something?

18:46.500 --> 18:49.791
Yeah, I was gonna
give 'em to you anyway, 'cause, see,

18:49.875 --> 18:53.375
one of them is made out
to Monsignor Pruitt.

18:53.458 --> 18:55.458
I didn't open that one.

18:55.541 --> 18:57.875
[exhales] I didn't wanna
burden the poor man.

18:59.458 --> 19:01.916
If he even remembers who Riley is anymore.

19:02.000 --> 19:02.833
He does.

19:03.333 --> 19:06.000
I thought you'd know best
if we should send it to him.

19:08.041 --> 19:11.083
Altar boy to his priest.
I thought maybe… I don't know.

19:13.041 --> 19:13.875
I don't know.

19:16.916 --> 19:18.916
[somber music playing]

20:20.083 --> 20:21.750
[Annie] Oh, Erin.

20:23.291 --> 20:24.125
How, um…

20:25.333 --> 20:27.500
-How are you?
-[Erin] Um, well, I'm…

20:28.500 --> 20:32.416
I was hoping that maybe
you and Ed and Warren would…

20:32.500 --> 20:36.541
I'm going to the mainland this evening,
I'm catching the Belle.

20:36.625 --> 20:39.125
I was hoping you would come with me.

20:40.541 --> 20:42.625
Well, dear. That's…

20:43.666 --> 20:45.500
My, what an odd request.

20:46.375 --> 20:49.291
No, we have mass tonight, Easter Vigil.

20:49.875 --> 20:51.333
And why would we…

20:52.875 --> 20:55.166
-Are you all right?
-[sniffles] Oh, yeah.

20:55.250 --> 20:59.416
[Annie] Whatever we can do for you,
we're here. We're here for…

21:02.916 --> 21:05.875
Honestly, instead, I wonder

21:07.708 --> 21:09.375
if you would help me.

21:10.875 --> 21:11.708
I, um…

21:14.333 --> 21:15.750
Well, to put it plain…

21:17.875 --> 21:19.416
I'm worried about Riley.

21:20.708 --> 21:24.333
And… maybe if you tell him

21:25.750 --> 21:27.458
he needs to come home…

21:30.625 --> 21:32.458
I'm not about to be in his business.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.708
-But this is days now.
-[sniffles]

21:36.875 --> 21:38.708
Maybe you could bring him home tonight?

21:39.916 --> 21:41.750
We could all have dinner before mass?

21:42.333 --> 21:43.333
Riley's dead.

21:46.958 --> 21:47.958
He is.

21:48.875 --> 21:50.000
I'm so sorry.

21:51.750 --> 21:54.333
[sniffles] But he's gone. I'm…

21:55.708 --> 22:00.291
He told me, if I could,
he wanted his family to be safe.

22:00.375 --> 22:02.250
-He wanted you away.
-Quiet.

22:03.416 --> 22:05.791
-I'm sorry.
-Be quiet, dear.

22:09.291 --> 22:13.750
We have always tried.
Our whole family, we have always tried

22:14.916 --> 22:17.458
to be there for you,
and we have always been.

22:17.541 --> 22:18.750
[sniffles]

22:18.833 --> 22:21.666
-Why would you say something like that?
-I'm sorry.

22:21.750 --> 22:24.291
[yelling] Why would you
say something like that?

22:24.375 --> 22:25.833
You're not funny.

22:25.916 --> 22:27.541
What is wrong with you?

22:28.125 --> 22:29.833
-Mrs. Flynn--
-Get out!

22:32.333 --> 22:33.333
[sniffles]

22:34.916 --> 22:35.916
[sobs]

22:41.166 --> 22:42.166
[exhales]

22:42.250 --> 22:44.291
-[Hassan] What?
-I know.

22:46.291 --> 22:48.541
I'm going to the mainland this afternoon.

22:48.625 --> 22:50.000
I'm bringing my samples,

22:50.083 --> 22:52.583
giving them to my colleagues
to corroborate my findings,

22:52.666 --> 22:54.250
and then I'm coming back here.

22:55.166 --> 22:56.000
With help.

22:56.583 --> 23:00.666
You're telling me there's
a contagion being spread intentionally

23:01.666 --> 23:02.583
at St. Patrick's.

23:03.375 --> 23:07.625
I'm telling you that is what I suspect,
even if it sounds… [scoffs]

23:07.708 --> 23:11.833
-What exactly are you asking of me?
-I suppose I'm asking you to look into it.

23:11.916 --> 23:14.291
Look into what, exactly?

23:15.458 --> 23:16.875
Look into St. Patrick's?

23:16.958 --> 23:19.666
On… And just to be clear,

23:19.750 --> 23:23.125
on the basis that some
of your mother's blood tests got damaged?

23:23.208 --> 23:25.541
-It's a lot to ask, I know.
-Do you?

23:26.500 --> 23:27.375
[Sarah sighs]

23:28.458 --> 23:29.291
Do you?

23:32.833 --> 23:35.041
[clicks tongue] Did I ever tell you
why I moved here?

23:36.000 --> 23:38.041
No. No, I don't think you did.

23:38.791 --> 23:41.125
Didn't tell anybody,
now that I think about it.

23:42.083 --> 23:45.166
It's almost as if nobody asked.

23:46.958 --> 23:50.958
You know, I was, um, 21
when the Towers went down.

23:51.500 --> 23:54.416
Watched it on TV
in my dorm room just weepin'.

23:55.708 --> 23:59.625
When I was a kid,
I wasn't religious at all, really.

24:00.916 --> 24:04.583
But I went to the mosque that day,
because they had a blood drive,

24:05.208 --> 24:06.958
and the line went for blocks.

24:07.625 --> 24:08.666
I wanted to help.

24:10.125 --> 24:12.875
I wanted to protect this country.

24:14.041 --> 24:18.250
So I moved to New York
and enrolled in NYPD training.

24:18.333 --> 24:20.541
Now, some of my friends,
they weren't happy.

24:21.125 --> 24:25.958
"NYPD is against us," they'd say.
But I'd tell them, "No. You're wrong."

24:26.958 --> 24:29.666
"I'll show them
they don't have to be afraid of us."

24:30.916 --> 24:32.333
"I'll show them who we are."

24:33.750 --> 24:35.000
So I worked my way up.

24:36.333 --> 24:40.708
You know, traffic, and translating
and transcribing wiretaps, then Vice.

24:40.791 --> 24:45.791
I get married. Ali is born,
and I'm promoted again. Detective now.

24:47.125 --> 24:52.041
Top secret security clearance
for the joint terrorism task force.

24:52.125 --> 24:55.791
I'm helping the FBI fight terrorists.

24:57.375 --> 25:01.875
We're taking collars. You know,
petty stuff, pot, parking tickets

25:01.958 --> 25:04.125
and leaning on them hard
if they're Muslim.

25:04.208 --> 25:07.458
"You know, we'll drop the charge,
help you out."

25:07.541 --> 25:09.125
"You go to the mosque and listen."

25:09.958 --> 25:12.583
I thought we were
supposed to be fighting terrorists.

25:13.625 --> 25:17.625
Not flipping some pothead student
in Queens to spy on Americans.

25:18.875 --> 25:20.583
So I complain.

25:21.625 --> 25:23.875
Gently. One time.

25:25.708 --> 25:26.666
Everything changed.

25:27.583 --> 25:30.333
I was surveilled by other cops.

25:30.916 --> 25:33.125
I mean, they even had
an official file on me.

25:34.916 --> 25:37.958
And not just me.
See, like, after the Towers,

25:38.541 --> 25:42.125
Muslim officers were promoted fast.
Especially if we knew the language,

25:42.208 --> 25:44.750
like, linguistic knowledge,
cultural knowledge.

25:45.583 --> 25:47.458
We were very desirable for that.

25:48.458 --> 25:50.125
But it started to occur to them,

25:51.833 --> 25:56.166
with so many of us on the force,
elevated to positions of real authority,

25:57.416 --> 26:00.041
what if that had been our plan all along?

26:02.833 --> 26:04.291
What if we were interlopers?

26:05.583 --> 26:07.125
What if we were infiltrators?

26:08.000 --> 26:13.500
What if we were double agents?
And they fucking panicked.

26:13.583 --> 26:17.000
Internal Affairs was suddenly all over us.
We were being followed.

26:17.083 --> 26:20.791
We're being recorded. Civilians too.
Surveilled at mosques, cafes.

26:20.875 --> 26:24.833
And suddenly I'm out of plain clothes
and I'm back in uniform.

26:26.625 --> 26:28.333
Night shift, street beat.

26:29.083 --> 26:32.833
And more and more,
I realize I've lost their trust.

26:38.000 --> 26:38.833
I roll with it.

26:40.041 --> 26:41.125
I keep my head high.

26:42.958 --> 26:43.791
Dignity.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.416
Dignity is a word my wife uses.

26:53.500 --> 26:55.166
"Show them dignity."

26:57.166 --> 26:58.791
And then she's diagnosed.

27:01.125 --> 27:05.208
And she's robbed of her dignity so fast.

27:08.333 --> 27:09.500
And then she's gone.

27:10.333 --> 27:11.250
And I couldn't…

27:15.708 --> 27:19.833
Ali and I get as far away as we can.
And I find this gig.

27:20.666 --> 27:21.791
This little island.

27:23.083 --> 27:26.625
So sleepy, it could be dead.

27:26.708 --> 27:33.000
No elections, no staff. Just a tiny room
at the back of a grocery store,

27:33.083 --> 27:37.166
and a bunch of fishermen without a notable
incident of intentional violence

27:37.250 --> 27:41.083
in almost a century,
and I beg for the post.

27:43.333 --> 27:44.166
Dignity.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.708
Ali is bored to tears.

27:50.583 --> 27:51.500
But he's safe.

27:53.041 --> 27:58.833
And I still think I could
maybe move the world that one millimeter.

28:00.583 --> 28:03.083
You know, maybe here's
where we make a difference.

28:03.166 --> 28:06.041
Not in the big city,
but in this tiny village.

28:06.750 --> 28:10.166
Win over the fucking PTA
and call it a victory for Islam.

28:11.250 --> 28:12.416
So I don't intimidate.

28:14.750 --> 28:20.000
I don't overshare
or overstep or intrude in any way.

28:20.958 --> 28:22.458
I don't even carry a gun.

28:24.708 --> 28:25.666
And still…

28:27.541 --> 28:28.375
Still…

28:29.583 --> 28:33.000
Beverly Keane and a few others too

28:33.958 --> 28:37.250
look at me like
I'm Osama bin-Fucking-Laden.

28:39.708 --> 28:40.958
And you'd like me

28:42.166 --> 28:43.875
to investigate St. Patrick's?

28:54.750 --> 28:55.916
For what it's worth,

28:56.458 --> 29:00.458
I want very much… very much to be wrong.

29:05.208 --> 29:08.833
-[Sarah sighs]
-Well, remind yourself, if this persists,

29:09.541 --> 29:12.500
you're basing this
on a third-hand account from Riley Flynn.

29:13.958 --> 29:16.250
Hardly the most reliable person
on the island.

29:17.333 --> 29:18.750
You don't carry a gun?

29:22.541 --> 29:23.625
No need.

29:25.833 --> 29:26.875
Hmm.

29:31.791 --> 29:32.958
[door closes]

29:33.875 --> 29:35.208
[seagulls squawking]

29:58.666 --> 30:00.041
[Sarah] Where's the Belle?

30:02.625 --> 30:05.916
I can count on one hand
the number of times that boat's been late.

30:07.416 --> 30:08.833
In my lifetime, anyway.

30:10.500 --> 30:11.583
Can I help you folks?

30:13.583 --> 30:15.916
-Just looking for the Belle.
-No Belle today.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.500
The mayor sent it for repairs.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.125
Uh… some parts that got recalled.

30:24.041 --> 30:27.000
The Belle and the Breeze.
We shipped 'em off this afternoon.

30:28.416 --> 30:29.333
Both of them.

30:30.083 --> 30:33.083
Well, not a lot of people go off-island
in the afternoon, he figured.

30:33.166 --> 30:34.541
That's morning business.

30:36.208 --> 30:38.416
Are y'all planning to go
off-island this afternoon?

30:39.708 --> 30:41.916
You'd get stuck over there.
You'd miss the vigil.

30:42.708 --> 30:44.458
The Breeze will be back in the morning?

30:46.000 --> 30:48.625
I think so. It's tough to say, though.

30:49.500 --> 30:54.291
But if you're worried, Doc,
I suggest you bring it up to the mayor.

30:54.958 --> 30:57.000
I'm sure he could put your mind at ease.

30:59.083 --> 31:00.000
I'm sure he can.

31:02.041 --> 31:04.375
If I did wanna send something over,

31:04.458 --> 31:06.833
I could always ask
a fisherman to run me, right?

31:07.583 --> 31:10.208
Lots of boats on this island,
if nothing else.

31:10.291 --> 31:12.500
You service them all, don't you?

31:14.125 --> 31:15.125
I reckon so.

31:16.791 --> 31:18.291
Like the one you're on right now?

31:20.125 --> 31:22.416
Yep. Just, uh, giving her a tune-up.

31:29.083 --> 31:30.458
Hey, don't forget!

31:30.541 --> 31:31.583
Easter Vigil.

31:32.916 --> 31:34.916
[eerie music playing]

31:48.625 --> 31:50.041
[thunder rumbling]

31:58.416 --> 31:59.250
[exhales]

32:26.250 --> 32:27.458
[exhales]

32:38.583 --> 32:40.083
-[Sturge] Yeah.
-Sturge.

32:40.166 --> 32:42.791
[Sturge] Yeah, hey.
Uh, hey, Sheriff. What do you want?

32:42.875 --> 32:47.333
Uh, nothing. Well, uh, we lost power
at the general store.

32:47.416 --> 32:50.333
-I just want to see if you're aware--
-Whole island, I'm afraid.

32:52.458 --> 32:54.916
-What, brownout?
-[Sturge] It happens now and again.

32:55.541 --> 32:58.333
Sometimes as simple
as something come loose underwater

32:58.416 --> 32:59.708
and the mainline getting funky.

32:59.791 --> 33:02.666
I tell you what,
I'll swing by the power station

33:02.750 --> 33:04.208
and, uh, take a look.

33:05.708 --> 33:08.666
-Uh, you need any company?
-Nah. No, I'm good.

33:09.750 --> 33:12.375
Okay, well, um, just keep me posted.

33:12.458 --> 33:13.916
Yeah, will do.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.375
That's the last of 'em.

33:23.916 --> 33:25.250
How about the boats?

33:25.333 --> 33:28.625
Got about half of 'em.
The rest I'll hit before the vigil.

33:29.708 --> 33:31.291
Let's wait on the tower.

33:32.583 --> 33:34.083
Maybe do that one last.

33:34.750 --> 33:36.833
When people are asleep or in church.

33:38.375 --> 33:42.833
Sheriff's eyebrow's already up.
The cellular might be a bridge too far.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
[Sturge] I'll handle it.

33:46.958 --> 33:48.958
[somber music playing]

33:49.875 --> 33:53.583
[Erin] So the ferries and the lights.

33:53.666 --> 33:59.416
And Sturge is servicing fishing boats
at the end of the day on Easter Weekend.

34:00.625 --> 34:01.708
[sighs]

34:03.291 --> 34:06.666
And if the cell tower goes down,
then we are completely cut off.

34:07.875 --> 34:09.125
-[Erin] Mm-hmm.
-Completely.

34:12.375 --> 34:13.541
[Sarah exhales]

34:16.500 --> 34:20.000
What about the smaller boats?
Uh, rowboats, canoes?

34:20.083 --> 34:22.958
We're surrounded by water
for 30 miles in every direction.

34:23.041 --> 34:26.541
It's not really an option.
It's not really.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.291
[sighs] The whole town
is gonna be at mass tonight.

34:31.375 --> 34:34.083
Well, not me and not Sarah.

34:34.166 --> 34:38.041
I told her never again,
even before we heard all this.

34:39.458 --> 34:41.750
I really appreciate
you taking me in today.

34:46.541 --> 34:47.791
But I'm gonna go tonight.

34:50.791 --> 34:53.333
-Why would you?
-[Erin] Because I don't know anything.

34:54.833 --> 34:57.166
I don't know what's gonna happen,
if anything will.

34:57.250 --> 35:00.916
What I know
is that Riley sacrificed everything.

35:01.875 --> 35:02.708
Everything.

35:03.666 --> 35:05.416
Because he thought I could help.

35:07.541 --> 35:10.708
And now the ferries are gone
and the power's out,

35:10.791 --> 35:13.250
and there are gonna be
people there tonight that I love.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.250
That Riley loved.

35:20.708 --> 35:22.333
So, yeah, I'm gonna be there.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.000
I'm gonna be there.

35:31.166 --> 35:32.541
[reciting Quran]

35:49.208 --> 35:50.416
[sighs]

35:53.000 --> 35:54.166
I miss you praying.

35:57.833 --> 35:59.625
It'd mean a lot to me if you'd join me.

36:04.416 --> 36:05.250
Right.

36:10.166 --> 36:13.708
-Ready for bed then?
-Tonight's Easter Vigil.

36:15.041 --> 36:19.875
It's at midnight. And it would mean
a lot to me if you came with me.

36:19.958 --> 36:22.083
[sighs] We've been through this, Ali.
I don't want to--

36:22.166 --> 36:25.208
I know, but they just keep telling me
what a big deal this mass is,

36:25.291 --> 36:26.833
and how important it is.

36:26.916 --> 36:29.041
Ooker says
Father Paul's been scrambling all day.

36:29.125 --> 36:32.250
There's supposedly some big surprise.

36:32.333 --> 36:34.791
Said something
about sharing a miracle tonight.

36:35.958 --> 36:36.916
A miracle?

36:37.000 --> 36:41.708
[Ali] Yeah, I mean, if it is, you know.
If it is a miracle, another miracle,

36:42.375 --> 36:45.791
I just want you to be there.
To see it together.

36:47.166 --> 36:48.166
Will you come?

37:06.375 --> 37:09.375
-[Bev] Happy Easter.
-Happy Easter, Miss Keane.

37:13.625 --> 37:14.916
How do you want to start?

37:15.500 --> 37:17.833
I gathered as many candles
as I could find,

37:17.916 --> 37:20.625
that we aren't using
in the church itself, that is.

37:21.208 --> 37:24.625
Figured we will start up the street,

37:25.166 --> 37:30.166
then cut through the square
around the east bank and to the church.

37:31.166 --> 37:32.416
Let people hear us.

37:34.041 --> 37:36.750
I brought some printouts for the hymns.
Wade, do you mind?

37:36.833 --> 37:37.666
No, of course.

37:40.583 --> 37:42.041
-For you.
-Thank you.

37:42.125 --> 37:42.958
Dolly.

37:44.833 --> 37:46.416
[Bev] "Sing to the Lord a new song."

37:47.541 --> 37:50.041
"Sing to the Lord, all the earth."

37:51.583 --> 37:53.208
[singing "Psalm 96"]

38:33.666 --> 38:35.583
[singing continues]

39:37.625 --> 39:39.166
[all singing]

41:16.458 --> 41:17.916
[singing continues]

42:20.000 --> 42:21.291
[organ playing]

43:24.541 --> 43:25.875
[music stops]

43:33.500 --> 43:35.375
[Father Paul] This right now
is one of the most

43:35.458 --> 43:37.416
beautiful things that I've ever seen.

43:39.375 --> 43:43.708
Now, some of you may have noticed
that I'm wearing a gold chasuble tonight.

43:43.791 --> 43:45.666
I was actually wearing this
on that first Sunday,

43:45.750 --> 43:48.291
the first day of the New Covenant.

43:48.375 --> 43:50.541
Bev called me out on it, in fact,

43:50.625 --> 43:54.375
and asked why I was wearing it
on a day in Ordinary Time.

43:55.458 --> 43:59.000
And what I couldn't tell her then,
but what I can tell you now,

43:59.083 --> 44:03.375
is that I chose it
because it was not an ordinary Sunday.

44:04.541 --> 44:05.541
Not even a little.

44:06.583 --> 44:10.166
And I had cause to celebrate, to rejoice.
It was a holy day.

44:10.250 --> 44:12.541
And tonight will be different as well.

44:13.333 --> 44:16.708
Tonight is the beginning of a new era.

44:17.583 --> 44:22.166
And we are meant to celebrate
the Resurrection tonight,

44:22.250 --> 44:27.041
and, and we will
more than anyone ever has.

44:27.125 --> 44:28.125
But first,

44:29.666 --> 44:32.666
bless me, brothers and sisters,
for I have sinned.

44:32.750 --> 44:36.375
It has been too long
since my last confession,

44:37.291 --> 44:40.083
and it is so long overdue,

44:41.333 --> 44:42.541
but here is my sin.

44:44.916 --> 44:46.791
I've lied to you all.

44:49.125 --> 44:52.541
I didn't come here
to replace Monsignor Pruitt.

44:53.500 --> 44:57.375
He isn't recovering in a hospital
in the mainland. He's perfectly healthy.

44:58.666 --> 44:59.625
He has been blessed.

45:01.208 --> 45:04.208
As you have all been blessed,
he has been made well,

45:04.291 --> 45:07.125
made whole, made young, the same as you.

45:07.791 --> 45:12.208
He was healed
long before you ever saw this face.

45:13.125 --> 45:18.166
He was the first, in fact,
and he stands before you right now,

45:19.750 --> 45:21.500
asking for your forgiveness.

45:24.083 --> 45:26.416
Now, some of you
must have thought it before,

45:26.500 --> 45:30.500
in the backs of your minds.
Minds so trained by the world

45:30.583 --> 45:33.791
to ignore that voice,
because how could it be?

45:33.875 --> 45:38.500
That would be impossible.
But nothing is impossible with God.

45:39.208 --> 45:40.416
As we have seen.

45:42.625 --> 45:46.458
I was lost and confused, tired and old,

45:46.541 --> 45:48.791
on the road to Damascus
when lo and behold,

45:48.875 --> 45:52.458
an angel of the Lord
appeared unto me and bestowed upon me

45:52.541 --> 45:55.291
the healing graces of God.

45:55.375 --> 45:58.875
And I was restored,
as you have all been restored.

45:59.500 --> 46:04.125
I returned to you all and I brought
with me that angel of the Lord

46:04.208 --> 46:09.625
so that he might bless us all,
and we have, we've seen the miracles.

46:10.291 --> 46:11.583
Our new bodies.

46:12.333 --> 46:17.125
The resurrection of the body,
new and everlasting life.

46:17.750 --> 46:21.250
Now tonight,
we will be tested, just a little,

46:21.333 --> 46:24.333
but we will be tested, as was Jesus.

46:25.208 --> 46:29.000
I was afraid when the New Covenant
was fulfilled for me.

46:29.750 --> 46:33.666
Afraid as was our Savior,
but "he who says he abides in Him,

46:33.750 --> 46:37.458
ought himself also to walk
just as He walked."

46:37.541 --> 46:40.250
"Be imitators of Christ."

46:40.916 --> 46:44.125
I followed him
into the valley of darkness,

46:44.208 --> 46:46.458
and like our Lord, I endured death.

46:47.166 --> 46:51.916
Mercifully short. A leap of faith,
a step out onto the water,

46:52.625 --> 46:56.833
was all he asked of me.
And, like Jesus, you will doubt,

46:56.916 --> 47:02.625
you will feel fear, but believe me,
I promise you, brothers and sisters,

47:04.000 --> 47:07.541
if you follow me,
if you follow us, if you follow Him,

47:08.916 --> 47:12.250
He will raise you again in His glory

47:13.250 --> 47:14.416
to eternal life.

47:16.666 --> 47:20.333
There is a price to be paid
for everlasting life,

47:20.416 --> 47:22.416
as there was for our Savior.

47:23.666 --> 47:26.541
And each one of us
will have the opportunity tonight

47:27.583 --> 47:28.875
to pay that price.

47:29.583 --> 47:30.875
But first and… [hesitates]

47:33.416 --> 47:36.125
I know after everything
we've been through together,

47:37.333 --> 47:41.500
this is not easy to believe,
so I invite you as Jesus invited Thomas

47:41.583 --> 47:43.333
to witness for yourself.

47:44.000 --> 47:44.875
Sturge.

47:53.458 --> 47:56.916
[reading] "And I John saw the holy city,
New Jerusalem,

47:57.000 --> 47:59.291
coming down from God out of Heaven,

47:59.375 --> 48:03.166
prepared as a bride
adorned for her husband."

48:03.250 --> 48:05.708
"And I heard
a great voice out of Heaven saying…"

48:05.791 --> 48:09.375
"…Behold, the Tabernacle of God
is with men,

48:09.458 --> 48:13.041
and he will dwell with them
and they shall be his people,

48:13.125 --> 48:16.916
and God himself shall be
with them and be their God."

48:17.000 --> 48:23.583
"He will wipe away every tear
from their eyes. Death will be no more."

48:23.666 --> 48:28.375
"Mourning and crying
and pain will be no more."

48:28.458 --> 48:30.875
"For the first things have passed away."

48:30.958 --> 48:33.416
"And the one who is seated
on the throne said,

48:33.500 --> 48:37.458
'See, I am making all things new.'"

48:37.541 --> 48:42.625
"'I am the Alpha and the Omega,
the beginning and the end.'"

48:42.708 --> 48:45.541
'"To the thirsty, I will give water

48:45.625 --> 48:49.583
as a gift from the spring
of the water of life.'"

48:56.750 --> 49:01.208
This will be frightening for all of us,
but, Sturge, my brother in Christ,

49:02.208 --> 49:03.250
are you afraid?

49:04.208 --> 49:05.875
No, Father. No, I'm not.

49:10.416 --> 49:11.333
God be with you.

49:21.250 --> 49:24.375
I'm with you.

49:28.416 --> 49:31.583
I'm with you. I'm with him.

49:32.500 --> 49:33.625
[groaning]

49:33.708 --> 49:36.333
-It's all right. That's okay.
-[all exclaiming]

49:36.416 --> 49:38.166
-It's okay. It's all right.
-[all gasping]

49:38.250 --> 49:40.000
[Sturge groaning]

49:40.083 --> 49:42.500
That's all right. He's all right.

49:42.583 --> 49:43.875
It's all right.

49:44.458 --> 49:47.708
It will be over soon.
It will be over soon.

49:49.291 --> 49:52.291
-It's all right.
-[Sturge groaning]

49:53.041 --> 49:56.625
It's all right. Have faith! Have faith!

49:56.708 --> 50:00.250
Have faith, my brother. Have faith!

50:01.583 --> 50:03.708
-It's all right.
-It's okay. I know.

50:03.791 --> 50:05.416
[Father Paul] This will be over soon.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.625
Soon. Soon.

50:09.875 --> 50:11.333
[shushes]

50:13.125 --> 50:14.125
Faith!

50:14.208 --> 50:18.083
Just a few minutes!
Just a few moments, really!

50:18.166 --> 50:21.416
The body is dead, but just for a moment!

50:21.500 --> 50:23.875
The resurrection of the body
is what Easter's about.

50:23.958 --> 50:26.708
That is what we are about to witness.

50:27.666 --> 50:28.958
Sheriff, please. I…

50:29.041 --> 50:30.666
[ominous music playing]

50:32.750 --> 50:34.041
[all gasping]

50:34.125 --> 50:35.208
[Father Paul] Behold.

50:36.458 --> 50:43.166
"Lo… lo and behold, an angel of the Lord
appeared to them. And they were afraid."

50:43.250 --> 50:44.541
[shudders]

50:44.625 --> 50:45.666
Have faith, brothers and sisters.

50:45.750 --> 50:48.458
I would not make you see
what you have seen,

50:48.541 --> 50:51.291
I would not ask you
to choose what you may choose,

50:51.375 --> 50:55.666
without first showing you God's messenger.

50:58.041 --> 51:00.083
[Sarah breathing heavily]

51:00.166 --> 51:04.000
And remember, brothers and sisters,
have faith that in the Bible,

51:04.083 --> 51:09.041
every time they mention an angel,
when an angel appears to we humans,

51:09.625 --> 51:11.250
we are afraid.

51:12.125 --> 51:14.833
"And an angel of the Lord appeared to them

51:14.916 --> 51:17.916
on the right side
of the altar of incense."

51:18.000 --> 51:24.166
"And when Zechariah saw him,
he was terrified and overcome with fear."

51:32.666 --> 51:34.375
[all gasping]

51:37.791 --> 51:40.750
[Father Paul] "Just then,
an angel of the Lord stood before them."

51:40.833 --> 51:45.458
"And the glory of God shone around them
and they were sore afraid."

51:45.541 --> 51:51.958
"And the angel said,
'Fear not, fear not, be not afraid!'"

51:52.041 --> 51:53.458
[gasps]

51:53.541 --> 51:54.958
[all gasping]

51:55.041 --> 51:57.458
-[murmuring]
-[Sturge groans]

51:57.541 --> 51:59.458
[Father Paul] "And then
they took away the stone

51:59.541 --> 52:02.041
from the cave
where the dead man was lying."

52:02.125 --> 52:04.125
[all exclaiming]

52:04.208 --> 52:05.750
[Father Paul] "And Jesus looked up

52:05.833 --> 52:08.958
unto the sky and said,

52:09.041 --> 52:14.583
'Father, I thank you, for you have
heard me. You have heard me.'"

52:14.666 --> 52:16.416
[Sturge grunts]

52:16.500 --> 52:19.166
[Father Paul sobbing]
"'Thank you for hearing me.'"

52:21.000 --> 52:22.541
[organ playing softly]

52:22.625 --> 52:24.958
[Father Paul] "And he cried out
in a loud voice!

52:25.041 --> 52:26.250
'Lazarus, come out!'"

52:26.333 --> 52:27.791
"And the dead man came out!"

52:27.875 --> 52:30.708
"And his feet and hands
were bound with shreds of cloth,

52:30.791 --> 52:34.916
and his face was wrapped in cloth,
and Jesus said to them,

52:35.000 --> 52:36.791
'Unbind him and let him go!'"

52:36.875 --> 52:41.208
Brothers and sisters,
you are so close to salvation.

52:41.291 --> 52:43.208
The miracle is already in you.

52:43.291 --> 52:45.750
The blood of the angel
is already in your veins,

52:45.833 --> 52:47.875
but it is incomplete.

52:47.958 --> 52:50.708
The final transformation will not be yours

52:50.791 --> 52:56.750
unless you let your earthly body die,
so that your divine body can awaken.

52:57.458 --> 53:00.708
One moment of faith.
That's the price God asks of us.

53:00.791 --> 53:03.333
Just one moment of courage.

53:04.416 --> 53:09.041
A small step out of the boat.
Just onto the water itself.

53:09.125 --> 53:14.875
A small moment of discomfort.
A small passion of our own.

53:15.458 --> 53:19.625
A gift offered up, and then we are reborn.

53:20.333 --> 53:23.833
Open your minds! Open your hearts!

53:24.416 --> 53:27.791
And listen to that voice.
That voice in the back of your head.

53:27.875 --> 53:32.250
That voice the world has tried to silence,
has tried to teach you to ignore!

53:32.333 --> 53:38.291
The voice of our angel,
telling you, "Be not afraid."

53:38.375 --> 53:40.166
-No. No.
-[cup clatters]

53:40.250 --> 53:41.500
-Come on.
-[Ali] Dad.

53:42.083 --> 53:44.916
Dad! Dad! Stop! Stop!

53:45.000 --> 53:48.541
Sheriff, Sheriff. I implore you
not to deprive yourself.

53:48.625 --> 53:52.625
Not to deprive your son
of the opportunity for salvation.

53:52.708 --> 53:54.958
-Okay.
-[all screaming]

53:55.041 --> 53:56.583
-[Hassan] Everybody stay back!
-Hey!

53:57.208 --> 53:59.375
[Hassan] Ali, come here right now.

53:59.458 --> 54:01.041
You're coming with me right now.

54:01.125 --> 54:04.250
And if one of you fucking people
come anywhere near my son!

54:04.333 --> 54:07.375
Hey, Sheriff, put that down.
There's no need to be waving a gun.

54:07.458 --> 54:08.791
-[gun fires]
-[all screaming]

54:08.875 --> 54:09.833
Back up!

54:11.166 --> 54:12.625
[Bev] How dare you?

54:12.708 --> 54:13.625
[grunts]

54:14.208 --> 54:17.708
How dare you bring
a firearm into the house of God!

54:18.333 --> 54:22.541
Blessed are you, my son,
for setting an example of courage.

54:22.625 --> 54:26.000
This young man is choosing God

54:26.083 --> 54:28.875
in the face of pressure
from his own father.

54:28.958 --> 54:32.333
-[grunting]
-That we should all be so fearless.

54:32.875 --> 54:35.791
Thank you. For setting an example.

54:37.166 --> 54:38.500
Welcome, my son.

54:39.958 --> 54:42.458
[Hassan] No, Ali. Hey, look at me.

54:42.541 --> 54:44.416
[breathing heavily]

54:44.500 --> 54:45.416
No.

54:47.958 --> 54:48.875
I choose God.

54:50.000 --> 54:55.041
[crying] No! No! No! No!

54:55.125 --> 54:57.416
I'm with you. I am with you.

54:57.500 --> 55:00.541
-No! [sobbing]
-[Father Paul] I am with you. It's okay.

55:01.125 --> 55:03.250
We have to do something.
We have to do something.

55:03.333 --> 55:04.708
-[all murmuring]
-[Hassan sobbing]

55:04.791 --> 55:07.041
-[Leeza] Mommy, no. No.
-It's okay.

55:07.125 --> 55:08.375
-Don't drink that.
-Don't!

55:08.916 --> 55:10.500
Don't. Please!

55:10.583 --> 55:12.500
-You don't need to do that.
-[Sarah] No!

55:13.416 --> 55:16.750
[all coughing]

55:16.833 --> 55:18.375
[crying] No.

55:18.458 --> 55:19.333
It's okay.

55:20.291 --> 55:21.416
[Wade] I can help you, honey.

55:21.500 --> 55:23.500
Listen to me, you're scared.
I can help you.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.041
[Hassan sobbing]

55:32.166 --> 55:33.791
-Daddy, wait. No.
-I can help you.

55:33.875 --> 55:37.166
Look at me. We'll do it together.
Okay? Look. [moaning]

55:38.500 --> 55:39.625
It's okay.

55:40.750 --> 55:43.875
[murmuring] Faith. Faith. Faith.

55:46.083 --> 55:47.125
Don't look at her.

55:50.500 --> 55:52.916
-[woman] Leeza!
-[man] Leeza!

55:53.000 --> 55:54.125
[cup clatters]

55:56.041 --> 55:57.541
[crying]

56:01.916 --> 56:05.791
Faith! Faith! Faith!

56:05.875 --> 56:10.041
When he raised them up,
and carried them on eagle's wings

56:10.125 --> 56:11.583
and brought them to himself!

56:12.416 --> 56:13.583
[gunshot]

56:18.791 --> 56:19.833
[screeches]

56:21.583 --> 56:22.583
[Mildred screams]

56:23.291 --> 56:25.958
-Mom! Mom!
-[Mildred continues screaming]

56:28.875 --> 56:30.041
Close the doors.

56:31.291 --> 56:33.375
Close the doors!

56:36.041 --> 56:36.958
Oh, thank God.

56:37.666 --> 56:38.583
Lock them!

56:40.208 --> 56:41.416
He is okay.

56:43.125 --> 56:45.833
He will be okay. He will heal.

56:45.916 --> 56:49.000
That is part of God's miracle!

56:49.625 --> 56:53.333
His miracle
which some of you would destroy!

56:54.583 --> 56:57.416
It won't be long. It won't take long.

56:57.500 --> 56:59.708
You rest and you heal.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.125
Hold him down.

57:03.708 --> 57:05.958
What do we do? Is he really gonna be okay?

57:06.041 --> 57:07.291
[Bev] Of course he is.

57:08.375 --> 57:11.375
-What is wrong with you?
-[groans]

57:11.458 --> 57:13.916
Spitting in the face of such a gift!

57:14.791 --> 57:16.583
Remove the sheriff. Take him out back.

57:17.208 --> 57:20.875
We'll need… We'll need food soon.

57:20.958 --> 57:23.291
[breathing heavily]

57:23.375 --> 57:24.541
[Bev] Sturge.

57:25.208 --> 57:26.083
Sturge!

57:31.458 --> 57:33.458
[heart beating]

57:33.541 --> 57:34.875
[gasps]

57:34.958 --> 57:36.041
[breathing heavily]

57:41.875 --> 57:43.416
Keep the doors locked.

57:44.458 --> 57:47.958
He planned on that.
He said, "Keep the doors closed,

57:48.041 --> 57:50.291
and when they woke, help them!"

57:51.166 --> 57:54.375
Brothers and sisters, rejoice!

57:54.458 --> 57:57.583
-The first of the apostles awakes.
-Ali.

57:57.666 --> 58:01.416
-[Bev] They will be thirsty for Communion.
-Ali. Hey.

58:01.500 --> 58:06.083
[Bev] The blessings of the Lord
will be bestowed on all of us!

58:06.166 --> 58:07.375
-[gasps]
-[Leeza] Mommy?

58:07.458 --> 58:08.875
-Mommy?
-[Dolly] Leeza.

58:08.958 --> 58:10.666
[Leeza crying]

58:10.750 --> 58:11.833
[gasps]

58:11.916 --> 58:12.916
[Leeza] Mommy!

58:13.416 --> 58:15.625
[Dolly] My love. We're saved.

58:16.375 --> 58:17.708
Oh, I was scared.

58:21.208 --> 58:23.708
[people gasping]

58:23.791 --> 58:25.166
[Leeza] Mommy!

58:26.583 --> 58:27.500
I'm okay, love.

58:28.208 --> 58:30.166
I'm okay. And I feel…

58:31.041 --> 58:32.875
-[Leeza] Mommy?
-Oh, honey.

58:33.750 --> 58:35.208
Oh, it's amazing.

58:36.083 --> 58:38.625
The candles, they're singing.

58:41.125 --> 58:42.958
[Bev] Thank God.

58:47.375 --> 58:48.500
Mommy?

58:49.333 --> 58:51.375
-Leeza.
-Mommy!

58:56.125 --> 58:57.333
It's all right. It's okay.

58:58.208 --> 58:59.625
-It's fine. It's okay.
-[woman] No.

58:59.708 --> 59:00.833
-Don't be suspicious.
-[woman whimpering]

59:00.916 --> 59:02.875
-[shrieks]
-[screams]

59:04.666 --> 59:06.916
[grunts]

59:07.958 --> 59:11.125
[screaming]

59:14.041 --> 59:15.250
Wade!

59:19.166 --> 59:20.916
-[man grunts]
-[all screaming]

59:25.583 --> 59:28.291
Come on! Let's go. We gotta go.

59:32.333 --> 59:34.125
[all clamoring]

59:36.583 --> 59:37.500
[grunts]

59:46.083 --> 59:46.916
No!

59:52.250 --> 59:54.416
-Let's go! Come on, this way!
-Mommy!

59:56.625 --> 59:58.916
-Go!
-Ed!

1:00:05.708 --> 1:00:09.125
[all screaming and grunting]

1:00:18.708 --> 1:00:20.208
[breathing heavily]

1:00:27.375 --> 1:00:29.250
That'll all be over soon.

1:00:29.833 --> 1:00:32.083
And they'll all wake up, eternal.

1:00:32.166 --> 1:00:33.000
You hid?

1:00:38.458 --> 1:00:40.583
What are you gonna do, Erin Greene?

1:00:41.291 --> 1:00:42.500
Guns?

1:00:43.083 --> 1:00:45.625
Those things don't matter anymore.

1:00:46.250 --> 1:00:49.291
Not in the new world.
The world without death.

1:00:51.083 --> 1:00:54.375
You could shoot me right now.
It would mean I'm five minutes behind--

1:00:54.458 --> 1:00:55.583
-[gunshot]
-[gasps]

1:01:00.791 --> 1:01:01.916
We have five minutes.

1:01:05.875 --> 1:01:08.375
[eerie music playing]

1:01:12.708 --> 1:01:14.791
[screaming continues in background]

1:01:30.708 --> 1:01:32.083
[gasps]

1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:53.250
[sighs]

1:02:19.750 --> 1:02:20.791
[Sturge] I don't…

1:02:22.083 --> 1:02:23.333
I don't know what happened.

1:02:25.500 --> 1:02:26.375
It's okay.

1:02:28.416 --> 1:02:29.458
I don't, uh…

1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:32.125
Open the doors.

1:02:33.416 --> 1:02:36.416
Monsignor said we should
close the doors before they wake up.

1:02:37.583 --> 1:02:42.750
So we can guide them,
orient them, so that this…

1:02:45.500 --> 1:02:46.958
So that this wouldn't happen.

1:02:47.875 --> 1:02:51.083
I love him. I truly do. But look,

1:02:51.166 --> 1:02:54.791
it happened nonetheless
as it was meant to.

1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:59.250
You know what they say.
"Man plans, God laughs."

1:03:00.833 --> 1:03:03.666
Those who have been coming to church
and taking Communion,

1:03:03.750 --> 1:03:05.458
they have nothing to fear tonight.

1:03:06.583 --> 1:03:08.166
As for the rest of them…

1:03:11.333 --> 1:03:13.125
Let God sort them out.

1:03:16.250 --> 1:03:17.416
Faith, Monsignor.

1:03:18.541 --> 1:03:21.041
Faith and courage. Like you said.

1:03:24.625 --> 1:03:26.125
Open the doors.

1:03:27.916 --> 1:03:32.708
The doors stay open,
just as the gates are always open.

1:03:36.291 --> 1:03:38.416
How else does the gospel spread?
