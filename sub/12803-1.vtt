welcome to The Big Good-bye.

(SIREN WAILING)

13:28.960 --> 13:32.873

<i>You have meditated for nearly 24 hours.</i>

13:33.400 --> 13:36.437
<i>In ten seconds you will reach nirvana</i>

13:36.520 --> 13:39.512
<i>and total spiritual enlightenment.</i>

13:39.960 --> 13:41.712
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

13:47.600 --> 13:49.272
<i>- Three, two...</i>
- Hmm?

(WHOOPING)

13:51.760 --> 13:52.760
(GRUNTING)

13:53.040 --> 13:55.349
Excuse me. All right, slow down.

13:55.480 --> 13:58.040
Does somebody want to explain?

13:58.320 --> 13:59.833
Sensei, the Foot Clan are attempting

13:59.920 --> 14:01.433
to break Shredder out of custody.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.030
(SIGHS) If Shredder is free,

14:04.120 --> 14:07.078
his reign of terror
over the city will begin again.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.280
Exactly.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.356
Then there's only one question.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.950
Why are you wasting time
talking to a grumpy old rat?

14:14.320 --> 14:15.878
Go get him!

14:17.760 --> 14:18.829
LEONARDO: Thanks, Dad.

14:19.440 --> 14:20.589
(GRUNTS)

14:22.400 --> 14:23.879
Okay, guys, don't get too excited.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.439
It's still a work in progress.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.478
MICHELANGELO: Oh!

14:29.840 --> 14:31.239
Dude!

14:31.520 --> 14:35.149
Oh, whoa! Are you kidding me?

14:35.960 --> 14:38.120
I'm telling you guys,
a lot of tweaking still required.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.240
But when it's done,
it's gonna be amazing.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.118
Well, no time like the present.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.553

<i>There's no organization to any of this.</i>

14:53.400 --> 14:55.356
<i>I've got red wires, yellow wires...</i>

14:55.480 --> 14:57.440
As you can see,
the spot welding's not done yet...

14:57.520 --> 14:59.296
- The seats don't recline...
- LEONARDO: Donnie! Donnie!

14:59.320 --> 15:00.355
Oh.

15:06.120 --> 15:09.032
All right, Shredder's convoy
is 7.2 miles east-northeast.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.155
Punch it!

15:15.040 --> 15:16.440
BAXTER: They moved the timeline up.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.595
(CHUCKLES)

15:17.680 --> 15:20.752
Here we go.
Sensei Shredder's on the move.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.474
You got 32 counts
of first-degree murder.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.158
Hot damn!

15:43.600 --> 15:45.670
You are one mean son of a bitch.

15:45.960 --> 15:47.856
And take it from someone
who has his own problems

15:47.880 --> 15:49.438
with anger management issues,

15:49.520 --> 15:52.193
you, my friend, seriously need a hobby.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.511
I myself am a hockey guy.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.839
I like my bone crushing on ice.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.273
You like hockey, right?

15:59.160 --> 16:01.390
No. I like cage fighting.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.033
Cage fighting. Okay. (CHUCKLES)

16:08.440 --> 16:09.475
(SOFTLY) It's him.

16:15.960 --> 16:19.475
Big fan of your work.
Especially your early stuff.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.991
My name is Bebop. This is Rocksteady.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.513
I know it's a crazy name, right,

16:24.600 --> 16:26.318
but his ancestors are from Finland.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.550
Yeah, that's right. I'm Finnish.

16:28.920 --> 16:30.478
Because when I start a beatdown,

16:30.560 --> 16:31.913
(SHOUTS) I always "finish" it!

16:32.000 --> 16:34.070
- What? Did you hear that?
- Yeah, I said it!

16:34.160 --> 16:35.309
- I said it!
- My man!

16:35.400 --> 16:36.753
- My man!
- Give me that foot.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.154
BOTH: Yeah! (LAUGHING)

16:39.000 --> 16:40.991
Hey! Shut up back there.

16:43.720 --> 16:46.314
World works in mysterious ways,
don't it, Shredder?

16:46.440 --> 16:49.318
Now you get to spend
the rest of your life behind bars

16:49.400 --> 16:50.753

- Where are the shells?
- They're in the bag.

18:37.880 --> 18:38.880
Are you kidding me?

18:39.360 --> 18:41.555
You send us on a highway

18:41.680 --> 18:43.830
with the most dangerous criminal
on the planet,

18:43.920 --> 18:45.353
and you don't load the shotgun!

- Okay. Hit the button.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.155
What button? What button?
There are a million buttons.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.280

Get him to the extraction point.

We are two miles from Exit 14.
Set up an intercept.

- What is that thing?
- It's a big-ass magnet.

If Sensei Shredder
can't make it to the extraction point,

22:00.840 --> 22:02.990
then we bring the extraction point to him.

22:03.080 --> 22:04.816
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Don't rush me! Don't rush me!

22:04.840 --> 22:05.840

22:19.280 --> 22:21.077
Okay. It's all you, Mikey.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.593
Time to shine.

22:23.440 --> 22:24.440
Ow! Ow!

22:24.960 --> 22:25.960
I'm sorry!

22:26.080 --> 22:27.832
- It's stuck.
- Oh, this sucks.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.119
- Oh, there it is.
- Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

22:31.640 --> 22:33.517
This is awesome!

22:33.960 --> 22:35.416
We have to teleport Shredder earlier.

22:35.440 --> 22:36.555
KARAI: But you said...

22:36.640 --> 22:39.234
Yes, that that would be
irresponsibly dangerous. True.

22:39.320 --> 22:41.280
All right, Donnie,
you've got to get Mikey closer.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.440
(SCREAMING)

22:54.280 --> 22:55.793
Take the shot, Mikey!

22:55.880 --> 22:56.880
(GRUNTS)

23:09.080 --> 23:10.593
Where'd he go?

23:11.720 --> 23:13.039
It worked!

23:13.480 --> 23:15.789
But... Shredder's location unknown?

23:21.240 --> 23:22.240
(GROANING)

23:26.480 --> 23:28.835
Where am I?

23:30.400 --> 23:31.992
Does it matter?

23:32.080 --> 23:34.275
I know what you're thinking right now.

23:34.360 --> 23:37.352
Of all the ways you'd like to kill me.

23:37.440 --> 23:40.193
But that would require
you outthinking me.

23:40.280 --> 23:44.353
And no one, no thing
is smarter than the Krang!

23:45.560 --> 23:46.959
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:47.040 --> 23:51.033
Did I get a little tentacle mucus
in your eyes, Shredder?

23:53.520 --> 23:56.080
So you know my name.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.071
Why am I here?

23:58.160 --> 24:00.435
Because you
and your buddy Dr. Stockman

24:00.520 --> 24:02.909
found something of mine.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.036
The teleportation device.

24:05.240 --> 24:08.391
The teleport was
supposed to break me out of prison.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.958
(LAUGHS) But it is capable
of so much more.

24:12.040 --> 24:13.871
That device is part of a machine

24:13.960 --> 24:15.837
called the arc capacitor.

24:16.400 --> 24:20.791
Years ago, I launched
the arc capacitor to Earth's dimension.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.110
But upon entering your atmosphere,

24:23.200 --> 24:25.509
it broke apart into three pieces.

24:26.480 --> 24:28.550
You and Stockman have one piece.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.275
Another is in a museum in New York.

24:31.360 --> 24:34.238
The third is in the Brazilian rainforest.

24:34.720 --> 24:36.392
Collect the other two pieces.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.391
Dr. Stockman should
be inventive enough

24:38.480 --> 24:42.075
to reassemble the arc capacitor.

24:42.160 --> 24:43.559
SHREDDER: And then what?

24:43.640 --> 24:44.959
KRANG: It will open a portal

24:45.040 --> 24:47.031
through which
I can bring my war machine,

24:47.120 --> 24:49.918
the Technodrome, to Earth.

24:50.560 --> 24:55.350
Together, we can bring
the people of your planet to their knees.

24:55.960 --> 24:57.439
I'm interested.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.360
I will help you take down planet Earth

25:00.440 --> 25:02.954
if you help me with my problem.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.957
Four brothers will try to stop me.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.559
Turtles.

25:09.720 --> 25:11.676
I'm aware of your past.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.632
Take this.

25:13.720 --> 25:17.872
It will solve
all your problems with those pests.

25:18.600 --> 25:22.115
I'll see you on the other side.

25:23.360 --> 25:24.360
(GRUNTING)

25:24.960 --> 25:28.157
Push me back in! (GRUNTING)

25:29.040 --> 25:30.996
Push me in, you stupid robot.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.120
(GRUNTS)

25:32.800 --> 25:34.119
More!

25:35.720 --> 25:37.199
You idiot!

25:37.440 --> 25:38.616
APRIL: Okay, so he just vanished?

25:38.640 --> 25:39.760
DONATELLO: Wait, wait, wait.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.440
If I run the video
from my shoulder camera

25:41.480 --> 25:42.616
through an electrostatic filter,

25:42.640 --> 25:45.313
we might be able to see
what happened to Shredder.

25:45.400 --> 25:47.197
Come on. Show me something, buddy.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.633
Look! Right there!

25:52.840 --> 25:56.276
It appears to be some kind of
residue from a teleportation event.

25:56.440 --> 25:59.876
Yeah, teleportation event residue, man.
It's the worst.

25:59.960 --> 26:02.155
Does that kind of technology even exist?

26:02.240 --> 26:04.800
Baxter Stockman's been
working on this kind of tech for years.

26:04.880 --> 26:06.576
All of that stuff
that I pulled off of his iPad,

26:06.600 --> 26:08.816
it was full of information
about Shredder and the Foot Clan.

26:08.840 --> 26:10.080
It was like a virtual playbook!

26:10.480 --> 26:13.995
Baxter has to have a backup.
And I bet it's on the mainframe at TCRI.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.919
Donnie, I need something.
What do you got?

26:17.000 --> 26:18.194
Wait.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.080
I know exactly what you need.

three convicted felons in one night!

abandoned and stripped.

- Okay. Uh...

a giant garbage truck

us like it is on a warpath.

the objective of this

the same thing myself.

But then it starts
launching manhole covers

for losing them in the first place.

And then he was talking
about opening up some sort of portal

43:19.240 --> 43:21.515
to another dimension, and then he...

43:21.600 --> 43:22.600
He took this purple ooze

43:22.680 --> 43:25.752
and he injected it into those
two criminals that escaped with him.

52:09.200 --> 52:12.715
it's called
"compartmentalization of information."

that ooze can make us human...

Now, I knew they couldn't
handle the truth about the purple ooze,

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.760

they proved me right.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.320
- Leonardo.
- I don't know what to do!

Donnie's nose is in his computer,

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.439
Raph's brains are in his biceps,

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.192
and Mikey's head's in the clouds!

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.998
I can't get them all on the same page.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.399
To think with one mind.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:09.597
You shouldn't want them all
to think the same.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:12.280
It's their different points of view
that make the team strong.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:15.754
A good leader understands this.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.718
A good brother accepts it.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.030

LEONARDO: Talk to me, Donnie.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.599
The computer's pinpointed
the isotopic signature of the purple ooze.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:31.032
I can track Bebop and Rocksteady's
exact coordinates.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.431

- I got 'em.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.755
They're at 36,000 feet,
traveling at 490 knots.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.519
Whoa. They've achieved
the power of flight!

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.033
Good for them, you know.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.272

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.360
Oh.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.992
It looks like our mutant buddies
are headed to Brazil.

The only real monster
in this city is Shredder

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.720
and the two mutants that he's created.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.193
Bebop and Rocksteady.

01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.736
If you think anything
coming out of your mouth

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.479
is gonna add to her credibility,
you are sorely mistaken.

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.074
Shredder mutated them
with the help of Baxter Stockman.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.696
That's actually who you need to go see.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.836
Funny you should mention Dr. Stockman

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.751

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:13.638

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:15.711

- Guess who's on it.

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:23.352
That's not what happened.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.320
That footage has been altered.
It's been edited.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.271
We checked its authenticity.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.616
I hate to break it to you,
but all the phones have been shut down

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.760
on account of monsters
breaking into our stationhouse.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.478
Well, I hate to break it to you,

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.397
but legally I'm entitled to a phone call.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.160
- Tell me where they are.
- I don't know.

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:46.031
But if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

(MICHELANGELO SCREAMING)

01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:02.791
I'm vertical!

01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:04.640
- Oh, you want some, too?
- (GRUNTING)

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.631
(CHUCKLING) I got it!

01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:13.235
Get him, Rock!

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.594
(BELLOWS)

01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:32.117
Whoa, stop, stop!

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:41.557
- Oh, no.
- (BOTH YELPING)

01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:42.920
(EXPLODING)

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:49.960
- BEBOP: Rock.
- ROCKSTEADY: Yeah, Beebs?

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:52.039
BEBOP: My man.

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.279
Hey! Heads up, Donnie. (YELLING)

01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:57.239
The beacon! (GROANING)

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.116
KRANG: Come here, little turtle.

01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:03.199
Let me give you a hug.

01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:05.108
Good-bye.

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:07.760
- (GROANING) Okay.

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:09.193
Raph! With me!

01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:15.715
(GROANING)

01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:17.035
Little help, guys!

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:27.639
DONATELLO: With Mikey!

01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:29.233
No!

01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:33.835
(KRANG CHOKING)

01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:40.910
LEONARDO: Guys, Krang is down,
but his ship's still building.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.228
(KRANG LAUGHING SOFTLY)

01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:51.760

DONATELLO: Drone activated.

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.192
It's gonna be close.

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:27.911
<i>Guys, now! Close the portal now!</i>

01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:29.120
I got this.

01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:31.760
(SIZZLING)

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:44.951
- Yes!
- (ALL CHEERING)

01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:03.191
Okay, this is our stop.

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:04.633
(ALL GRUNTING)

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:11.237
I'll be back, turtles,

01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:14.473
a thousand times stronger!

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.672
(ALL CHEERING)

01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:25.874
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.592
It's cool. It's cool.

01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:32.636
Yeah, I knew that would work.

01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:34.416
Wait, so you seriously
thought us four teenagers

01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:35.714
could save the whole world?

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:36.875
Sure.

01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:39.474
Guys, we got something
no one else has.

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:40.709
(ALL CHUCKLING)

01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:43.112

- RAPHAEL: Garbage truck!

01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:44.832
- Garbage truck?
- (STAMMERS)

01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:47.753
- Well, we do have one.

APRIL: <i>Escaped convicts
Bebop and Rocksteady</i>

01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:55.314
<i>are now in police custody,</i>

01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:58.039
while Dr. Baxter Stockman
remains at large.

01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:00.674
Authorities assure us that
the city is once again safe,

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:03.633
however questions remain
about last week's events.

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:05.512
What was that threat from the sky

01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:07.358
and how exactly was it averted?

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.954
But the bigger question is,
does it even matter?

01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:12.918
Do we need to give our heroes
a name and a face?

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.476
<i>Or is it enough
to know that they're out there</i>

01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.710
<i>watching over us from the shadows?</i>

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:21.795
For your incredible valor
within this community,

01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:25.793
and for your uncompromising
cooperation with this agency,

01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:28.474
I present to you the keys to the city,

01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:31.875
a symbol of our appreciation,

01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.514
respect,

01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:35.710
and for our continued partnership.

01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:38.835
To you brothers,

01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:40.993
Leonardo,

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:45.355
Raphael, Donatello, Michelangelo...

01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:48.995
Uh...

01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:50.275
Last name?

01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:53.311
Uh... Not so much.

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:55.391
I never thought of that. That's no fair.

01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.000
CHIEF VINCENT: Congratulations.

01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:00.674
(APPLAUSE)

01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:10.910
I got one of those. No big deal.

01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:14.916
I helped them. They're friends of mine.

01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:16.040
Oh.

01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:17.919
So, you got plans next weekend?

01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:19.754
Just my regular hockey game.

01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:21.953
Do you want to come watch me play?

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:24.110
Watch? I'll take you one on one.

01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:26.113
- (SCOFFS)
- And I'll kick your butt.

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.074
I bet you will.

01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:29.760
(CHUCKLES)

01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:31.874
My key's totally bigger.

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:33.920
It's bigger than your key, man.
I got the big key.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.275
I think you should
give people more credit.

01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:39.440
They'll accept you now.

01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:42.872
You're probably right.

01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.314
But, uh...

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:48.835
I think we'll stick with
the arrangement we've had.

01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:52.552
If you ever need us,
April knows where to find us.

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:53.960
Really?

01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:57.029
You could live a normal life,

01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:59.075
like the rest of us.

01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:01.399
Normal?

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:04.872
What fun is that?
