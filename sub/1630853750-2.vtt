WEBVTT

00:24.441 --> 00:26.025
Okay, is number two clear yet?

00:26.109 --> 00:29.779
Dispatch, we are 1097
at St. Joseph Hospital.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.907
Time is 18:47.

00:32.991 --> 00:37.704
Inmate number 89012-011.

00:37.787 --> 00:41.833
Alert the Watch Sergeant
inmate is heading into surgery. Over.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.128
Hey. What's the word?

00:45.211 --> 00:47.172
Um, nothing yet.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.842
-I'm gonna see what I can find out.
-All right.

00:50.925 --> 00:52.886
Hey, what the hell happened in there?

00:52.969 --> 00:56.848
Jimmy tried to get rid of Brady. It was
actually Jimmy's cousin who shivved him.

00:56.931 --> 00:58.767
Mike, we gotta get him out of there.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.894
Brady is not your problem, Jack.

01:00.977 --> 01:04.022
I'm telling you he is, okay?
Brady didn't shoot me.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.190
Then who was it?

01:05.899 --> 01:08.401
I'm pretty sure it was the guy
that took Christopher.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.195
Wes' brother? Vince?

01:10.278 --> 01:12.572
Preacher's PI turned up
with some security footage.

01:12.655 --> 01:14.157
I've seen it with my own eyes.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.409
I told you, Jack, the gun was a match.

01:16.493 --> 01:19.662
-I'm telling you he's innocent.
-Okay, how bad is he?

01:19.746 --> 01:20.705
No one knows yet.

01:20.789 --> 01:23.958
Okay, so, he has a lacerated kidney,

01:24.042 --> 01:26.878
the cut was deep,
but luckily it missed the renal artery.

01:26.961 --> 01:28.129
Is he out of surgery?

01:28.213 --> 01:29.047
Not yet.

01:29.130 --> 01:32.175
-But he's gonna survive, right?
-Yeah, they think so.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.134
It's okay.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.261
-Hey, it's okay.

01:35.345 --> 01:39.265
The nurse told me that she's gonna text me
when he's in the recovery room.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.392
I just need a minute.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.484
I think we're going to get some air. Okay?

01:50.485 --> 01:51.319
Hey.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.452
Babe, you can't blame yourself.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.164
Well, I read the situation wrong.

02:04.999 --> 02:07.377
I should have known Brady
wasn't the one who shot me.

02:07.460 --> 02:12.966
You know, you've told me Brady
has made some really poor choices, right?

02:13.716 --> 02:16.594
I mean, you said in Iraq,
if it wasn't for him--

02:16.678 --> 02:19.931
Brady's crime
was being an impatient kid who...

02:20.932 --> 02:22.142
just didn't follow orders.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.018
He didn't mean for Lonergan to die.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.646
I know, look, all I'm saying is

02:26.729 --> 02:29.566
he has a history
of being impulsive, right?

02:29.649 --> 02:32.068
And he was working for Calvin. I mean...

02:35.196 --> 02:38.074
If I believed him,
he wouldn't be lying there right now.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.535
-Jack.
-It's true.

02:40.618 --> 02:43.413
You didn't put Brady in jail.
The evidence did.

02:47.083 --> 02:47.959
Hi.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.086
Hi, Jo Ellen.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.172
Yeah. Oh.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.759
Okay. Yeah. No, I'll let him know.

02:58.511 --> 03:02.640
Okay, I'll tell him. Thank you. Bye.

03:02.724 --> 03:03.725
What is it?

03:03.808 --> 03:06.477
Your dad just checked into the B&B.

03:07.186 --> 03:09.981
My dad is at the B&B?

03:10.064 --> 03:12.942
Jo Ellen called to say
that he wanted you and Brie

03:13.026 --> 03:15.194
to meet him at the bar in the morning.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.197
-Why wouldn't he just call me directly?
-I do not know.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.325
Oh...

03:21.326 --> 03:23.745
Christ, can this day get any worse?

03:25.705 --> 03:29.751
Well, you know, we could be held up
at gunpoint again, and kidnapped and--

03:29.834 --> 03:31.210
Don't. Don't even go there.

03:31.294 --> 03:36.758
It's true. It could be that
or I could be pregnant with triplets.

03:36.841 --> 03:39.093
Wow. I can't believe you just said that.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.720
Now you're just being mean.

03:40.803 --> 03:44.682
-You're horrible. Horrible human being.
-No. I'm not. I'm just being silly.

03:48.811 --> 03:52.398
Come on, it'll be nice
to get to spend time with your dad.

03:52.482 --> 03:53.733
Oh, okay.

03:54.525 --> 03:57.362
-What?
-Your optimism is cute.

03:57.445 --> 03:58.404
Aw.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.429
Hey. How's Brady?

04:23.930 --> 04:25.056
Stable.

04:26.474 --> 04:29.936
He's not allowed visitors,
but I'm gonna try and see him anyway.

04:30.019 --> 04:31.271
<i>Okay, good.</i>

04:31.354 --> 04:35.608
Speaking of visitors, Dad's in town.
He checked into the B&B last night.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.610
<i>Yeah, I know. He called me.</i>

04:38.736 --> 04:40.446
Wait, you knew he was coming?

04:40.530 --> 04:42.615
No, I was as shocked as you are.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.952
Why isn't Mom with him?

04:46.035 --> 04:48.371
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>Dad's ever taken a trip without her.</i>

04:48.454 --> 04:51.499
Well, maybe something's up with him.

04:51.582 --> 04:53.251
Why would you even say that?

04:53.334 --> 04:57.255
<i>Dad always acted like he was above us,</i>
<i>including Mom.</i>

04:57.338 --> 05:00.550
You're just saying that
because you and Dad didn't get along.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.427
You should see how sweet he is to her.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.220
All I remember is arguing.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.014
You lived with him like 20 years ago.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.892
Anyway, we're supposed to meet him
in a couple of hours at the bar,

05:09.976 --> 05:13.146
and since Mom's not here to referee,
that's going to be your job, okay?

05:13.229 --> 05:16.733
I've been here all night.
I'm not leaving until I see Brady.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.277
This is my only chance
to talk to him alone.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.946
Oh, come on. So I'm gonna be on my own?

05:22.030 --> 05:24.324
<i>I'll take him off your hands</i>
<i>as soon as I can.</i>

05:25.575 --> 05:27.493
You seriously owe me one.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.662
<i>I know. You're the best.</i>

05:30.413 --> 05:31.622
Yeah.

05:31.706 --> 05:33.708
-Hey.
-Hi.

05:34.584 --> 05:35.960
I missed you this morning.

05:36.294 --> 05:41.049
Aw. Well, I woke up at 5:00
and I couldn't go back to sleep, so...

05:42.258 --> 05:43.426
How was your run?

05:43.509 --> 05:45.928
It was amazing. It's gorgeous outside.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.055
Oh, good.

05:48.931 --> 05:50.266
You sure it's safe?

05:50.850 --> 05:53.227
What do you mean? Running alone?

05:53.770 --> 05:55.646
No. The baby.

05:56.522 --> 05:57.523
Oh.

05:57.607 --> 05:58.649
No, no, no. I--

05:59.275 --> 06:02.528
It's fine,
because I ran before I got pregnant.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.239
-What do you mean?
-They don't want you to do anything new

06:05.323 --> 06:07.283
-like powerlifting.
-Oh, right.

06:07.366 --> 06:10.244
What about power-walking?
I heard it's even better than running.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.370
-Jack.
-For the knees.

06:11.454 --> 06:12.747
-No.
-Back.

06:12.830 --> 06:15.041
I just don't want you
pushing yourself too hard.

06:15.124 --> 06:19.128
Honey, if anybody is being careful,
it's me. Okay?

06:20.004 --> 06:21.714
I'm not questioning your judgment.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.758
Okay. Thanks for clearing that up.

06:24.383 --> 06:26.511
So, what's on deck for today?

06:26.594 --> 06:30.139
Um, I'm gonna stop by
and visit Hope after work,

06:30.807 --> 06:33.267
and we sent her flowers.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.686
-That's very sweet of us.
-We are very sweet people.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.689
Tell Hope I'll visit her
as soon as my dad leaves town.

06:38.773 --> 06:41.609
-Okay. What time are you seeing him?
-10:00.

06:42.693 --> 06:45.029
Well, maybe I'll stop by and say hello.

06:45.113 --> 06:49.033
I mean, he was so sweet to me
when you were in the hospital.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.119
-Was he now?
-Yeah.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.247
-Oh, honey.
-What?

06:54.330 --> 06:56.791
Your shoulders are really tense.

06:56.874 --> 06:59.710
Yeah, my dad tends
to have that effect on me.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.423
Well, a hot shower for two might help.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.970
-Oh. Yeah? Think that'll do the trick?
-Mm-hm.

07:09.053 --> 07:09.929
I think so.

07:10.012 --> 07:13.808
You know, heat therapy's
proven to be very effective

07:13.891 --> 07:16.185
for muscle spasms.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.812
Oh, okay.

07:17.895 --> 07:20.106
Well, who am I to argue with a nurse?

07:24.652 --> 07:27.238
Mel and Jack
sent you some flowers.

07:27.321 --> 07:29.699
That was very nice of them.

07:34.328 --> 07:38.249
You want to call them and say thank you?

07:38.332 --> 07:40.751
If you could take care of that,
that'd be great.

07:43.129 --> 07:46.591
Honey, isolating yourself is not healthy.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.219
I think we need to ask your neurologist
if you can move up to--

07:50.303 --> 07:52.013
No. No more doctors.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.140
And if you keep pushing,
that'll include you.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.856
Okay, fine. What do you want me to do?

08:02.440 --> 08:04.400
Well, Jo Ellen called,

08:04.484 --> 08:07.111
she said that the sewing circle
is meeting over at Jack's.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.739
I'm not ready for that level of chitchat.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.492
You will be so much happier
surrounded by all your friends.

08:12.575 --> 08:13.784
Just give it an hour.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.621
Thirty minutes.

08:16.704 --> 08:19.916
Twenty-nine minutes and not a second more.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.084
Deal.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.086
Excellent.

08:24.712 --> 08:28.049
Oh. And by the way,
you should probably get ready.

08:28.132 --> 08:31.135
They're expecting you over there
in 30 minutes.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.554
What if I said no?

08:34.138 --> 08:35.431
I hadn't even considered it.

08:38.684 --> 08:39.602
No visitors.

08:39.685 --> 08:41.562
I'm the patient's attorney.

08:41.646 --> 08:42.480
Yeah?

08:43.064 --> 08:45.399
Unless you have clearance
from the Watch Commander,

08:45.483 --> 08:46.651
you're not getting in.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.278
Is your Watch Commander aware that

08:49.362 --> 08:52.031
inmates have the right to establish
Health Care Directives?

08:52.114 --> 08:52.990
I have no idea.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.910
My client has not been given
any such opportunity,

08:55.993 --> 08:59.455
which is in direct violation of
California Penal Code 2604.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.624
Subsequently, the hospital and the prison

09:01.707 --> 09:05.503
assume legal liability for willful neglect
to provide a basic standard of care,

09:05.586 --> 09:08.339
as designated by the Eighth Amendment
of the US Constitution.

09:08.422 --> 09:09.924
-Lady...
-You can either let me in

09:10.007 --> 09:11.801
so I can secure
my client's medical directives

09:11.884 --> 09:14.845
or I will contact the hospital CEO,
the prison warden

09:14.929 --> 09:17.807
and the press who will be happy
to camp out on your front lawn

09:17.890 --> 09:19.600
until you can offer up an explanation

09:19.684 --> 09:22.520
for participating
in this miscarriage of justice.

09:24.063 --> 09:27.024
If I let you in, will you leave me alone?

09:27.108 --> 09:28.901
Yeah, it would be my pleasure.

09:37.368 --> 09:40.454
-Hey, how are you holding up, bud?
-Hey, you know, surviving.

09:41.372 --> 09:45.501
Hey, would you mind if I take off
for a few hours this afternoon?

09:45.585 --> 09:49.839
A buddy of mine from the veterans group
suggested an Aikido class

09:49.922 --> 09:51.132
could help me with stress.

09:51.215 --> 09:52.842
Sure, yeah, whatever you need.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.303
We're partners.
You don't need to ask for time off.

09:55.386 --> 09:56.387
I appreciate it.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.684
Hey. Whatever happened to you proposing?

10:03.060 --> 10:05.479
-Oh, we decided to wait.
-Oh.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.898
So she turned you down.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.192
For your information,
I never officially asked.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.069
Man, whatever gets you through the day.

10:12.153 --> 10:12.987
All right.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.406
-Hey, Mel.
-Hey, Preach.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.909
My love, for you.

10:18.993 --> 10:19.952
Thank you.

10:20.786 --> 10:23.331
-So, is your dad here yet?
-No, he never showed up.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.249
-Really?
-Oh, damn.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.418
Spoke too soon.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.003
Come on.

10:30.296 --> 10:33.591
Mel, good to see you.
You're looking luminous.

10:33.674 --> 10:38.596
Aw, well, thank you, Sam.
I'm so happy to have you visit.

10:40.222 --> 10:41.349
Hi, Dad.

10:41.932 --> 10:42.767
Son.

10:44.018 --> 10:47.563
So this is the famous Jack's Bar?

10:48.356 --> 10:50.024
You've not been here before?

10:50.107 --> 10:53.444
Between teaching and publishing
for the university, my time is limited.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.781
So, what do you think?

10:56.864 --> 11:00.576
Eh. You should repaint the outside.
It's looking a little dingy.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.079
-Thanks for the tip.
-You're welcome.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.582
So what brings you to town, Dad?

11:06.666 --> 11:07.667
Just checking in.

11:07.750 --> 11:13.047
Really? Because I've lived here for
over seven years. You've never checked in.

11:14.215 --> 11:17.426
-I'm also here to see your sister.
-Yeah. Well, that tracks.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.887
Your mother and I,
we just don't understand.

11:20.513 --> 11:24.141
She had a prestigious job,
then to suddenly up and quit...

11:24.225 --> 11:26.268
Sometimes people need a change, I guess.

11:26.352 --> 11:29.605
Your mother will be crushed
if she doesn't come back to Sacramento.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.609
We used to have dinner
two, three times a week.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.154
Without her visits, the house is empty.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.239
Oh.

11:38.322 --> 11:41.784
Well, you're going to have grandkids
running around soon, so...

11:42.451 --> 11:45.121
-The twins.
-You're pregnant with twins?

11:45.204 --> 11:46.664
I'm not pregnant with twins.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.666
Charmaine.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.376
You got Charmaine pregnant?

11:52.670 --> 11:57.758
Uh, you know, why don't you grab a booth
and I'll get us some coffee, huh?

12:00.761 --> 12:05.307
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
I thought your parents knew.

12:07.309 --> 12:10.104
No, I wasn't that psyched on telling them.

12:12.898 --> 12:15.276
We've been busy. I got shot.
You got pregnant.

12:15.359 --> 12:17.278
That's not funny. I feel sick.

12:17.361 --> 12:19.905
Don't worry about it. I can handle my dad.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.825
You sure you don't want me to stay
and help smooth things over?

12:22.908 --> 12:23.909
-It's fine.
-No, I can.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.327
It's fine. Really.

12:26.078 --> 12:29.039
-He was gonna find out at some point.
-Yeah, but--

12:30.374 --> 12:31.667
-I love you.
-I love you too.

12:31.750 --> 12:32.835
Oh, jeez.

12:33.752 --> 12:37.131
Look, I'm sorry we didn't get a chance
to talk yesterday.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.758
I totally understand.
You need to take care of your wife.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.803
I didn't want you to think
I was upset with you.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.347
Not at all. You seem like
a pretty straightforward guy.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.265
Yeah.

12:47.016 --> 12:50.102
Plus, I sort of dropped a bomb
in your lap.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.396
Whew. Two, if you count me.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.565
Well, I...

12:54.648 --> 12:56.984
I definitely count you.

12:57.693 --> 13:02.406
You know what? I just-- I don't understand
why Rose's sister lied to me.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.576
She told me that Rose had passed away.

13:05.659 --> 13:08.704
I asked the same question,
but Grandma wouldn't talk about it.

13:08.787 --> 13:12.374
Did she say anything? Anything about us?

13:12.458 --> 13:13.876
That you met in college,

13:13.959 --> 13:16.212
but you guys broke up
when you went to med school.

13:16.837 --> 13:20.966
Well, no, actually she broke up with me.

13:21.842 --> 13:26.514
She sent me a letter
telling me she had met someone else.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.725
That was the last I heard from her.

13:29.808 --> 13:32.436
I'm pretty sure
she was pregnant with my dad.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.106
God, why wouldn't she tell me?

13:37.858 --> 13:41.070
Maybe she didn't want to get in the way
of you becoming a doctor.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.781
Like, I came here a few weeks ago,

13:43.864 --> 13:46.283
but when I found out
your wife was in the hospital, I left,

13:46.367 --> 13:48.953
because I didn't want to burden you.

13:50.037 --> 13:52.289
And I get that from my grandma.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.376
What made you return?

13:55.459 --> 13:58.504
I'm taking a year off
from college to travel

13:58.587 --> 14:01.549
and I wanted to meet you
before I left the country.

14:02.508 --> 14:06.136
I called the hospital and they said
your wife was no longer a patient.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.763
I hope that was okay.

14:07.846 --> 14:10.140
Without a doubt.
No, I'm glad you came back.

14:10.224 --> 14:12.560
-Aunt Connie thought you might like these.
-Oh!

14:13.310 --> 14:17.523
Uh, Lizzie, this is my grandson, Denny.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.818
Denny, this is the lovely Lizzie.

14:20.901 --> 14:22.319
-Hey.
-Hi.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.572
Oh, excuse me.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.449
Uh, I'm sorry to cut this short...

14:27.533 --> 14:29.869
but do you mind sticking around?
We can have dinner?

14:29.952 --> 14:30.828
That'd be great.

14:30.911 --> 14:34.248
And in the meantime,
maybe Lizzie can show you around?

14:34.957 --> 14:37.042
I would, but I'm not done with work.

14:37.126 --> 14:40.087
Oh, go ahead, Lizzie. We're not that busy.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.464
-Good.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.718
That woman has the hearing
of a mouse-eared bat.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.179
-So, you want to hang out?
-Sure.

14:49.263 --> 14:50.139
Excellent.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.892
Okay. I will call you later, Denny.
You kids have fun.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.395
So, what do you feel like doing?

14:57.271 --> 14:59.273
Would you be willing to wear
a life jacket?

15:07.615 --> 15:10.117
Hey. Hi, there. Sorry.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.327
I'll be right back.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.289
Am I happy to see you.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.666
Female, 25 years of age, unknown gestation

15:17.750 --> 15:19.793
and she's currently
eight centimeters dilated.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.046
Okay. How long has she been in labor for?

15:22.129 --> 15:23.923
I have no idea. They just got here.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.383
Okay. Have you delivered
many babies before?

15:26.467 --> 15:28.552
-Not since I was an intern.
-Ah.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.138
-Is there a chart?
-There's no reported prenatal care.

15:31.221 --> 15:33.891
She said something about
living in a camper outside of town

15:33.974 --> 15:37.061
-and that she doesn't have insurance.
-Can we get some help?

15:37.645 --> 15:40.314
Hi. Hey. Hi, there.

15:40.397 --> 15:41.440
My name is Mel Monroe.

15:41.523 --> 15:44.818
I'm a nurse and midwife and I'm here
to help you deliver your baby, okay?

15:44.902 --> 15:45.986
Okay, what's your name?

15:46.070 --> 15:48.155
-Lee Ann Carter.
-Lee Ann, nice to meet you.

15:48.238 --> 15:50.491
Do you mind if I take a look? Okay.

15:50.574 --> 15:53.494
I'm her husband, Ben.
She says she's having trouble breathing.

15:53.577 --> 15:54.411
Okay.

15:54.995 --> 15:58.916
Well, her pulse is solid,
so it's probably the pain.

15:58.999 --> 16:02.628
Sometimes pain can induce panic,
which is why her breathing is shallow.

16:02.711 --> 16:06.799
Lee Ann, I need you to start taking
some slow, deep breaths, okay?

16:06.882 --> 16:08.467
I can't, it hurts.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.886
I know. I know it does, honey.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.640
All right, just watch me. Okay, just go...

16:19.103 --> 16:21.188
Excellent. You got this.

16:21.271 --> 16:23.065
I'm going to take a look. Okay?

16:26.235 --> 16:28.445
She's 10 centimeters dilated
and fully effaced.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.365
-Okay.
-It's time to start pushing. Okay?

16:31.448 --> 16:33.993
-What do you want me to do?
-Hold my damn hand!

16:34.076 --> 16:35.577
I would just do what she says.

16:37.329 --> 16:41.917
All right. On your next contraction,
I want you to give me a big push. Okay?

16:42.001 --> 16:44.503
Okay, here it comes.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.426
And you're sure the twins
are definitely yours?

16:51.301 --> 16:52.219
Yeah.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.805
Are you gonna marry her?

16:54.888 --> 16:57.558
No. She just got married to somebody else.

16:57.641 --> 17:00.102
So, you're gonna let another man
raise your children?

17:00.185 --> 17:01.603
No, we're going to co-parent.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.397
What's that supposed to mean?

17:03.480 --> 17:06.025
The kids will go back and forth
between me and Charmaine.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.901
Well, that doesn't sound fair to them.

17:07.985 --> 17:12.114
No, it's not ideal, Dad, but, you know,
I want to be in their life, so...

17:12.197 --> 17:13.365
Just not full-time.

17:15.325 --> 17:17.828
If it was up to me,
I would be with them 24/7.

17:17.911 --> 17:20.789
Well, then you shouldn't have
let Charmaine marry somebody else.

17:20.873 --> 17:24.710
-Dad, I'm not in love with her.
-Not all marriages are based on love.

17:24.793 --> 17:26.920
-Are you talking about you and Mom?
-Of course not.

17:27.004 --> 17:30.049
You should've married Charmaine
when you had the chance.

17:30.132 --> 17:33.093
I'm sorry but entering into
a loveless marriage wasn't the answer.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.721
In life,
you don't always get what you want.

17:35.804 --> 17:39.767
And for the record,
Sheridans finish what they start.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.977
Well, where are you going?

17:42.061 --> 17:43.187
To cool off.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.578
We've barely left the shore.

17:59.661 --> 18:02.456
-Uh, that's because you're not pedaling.
-Hey, this was your idea.

18:02.539 --> 18:04.875
If it were up to me,
we'd be eating fries right now.

18:05.375 --> 18:09.046
Okay, if we make it to that buoy and back,
I'll buy you all the fries you can eat.

18:09.129 --> 18:11.423
-Okay, you're on.
-Okay.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.678
Okay, random question for you.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.097
If you had to pick between

18:18.180 --> 18:20.766
24 hours of sunlight
or 24 hours of moonlight,

18:20.849 --> 18:21.850
which would you pick?

18:22.392 --> 18:27.272
Mm. I'm a night owl,
so I'd pick moonlight. What about you?

18:27.356 --> 18:28.273
Same.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.566
-Really?
-Yeah.

18:30.484 --> 18:33.403
My first year of college,
I never scheduled a class before noon.

18:33.487 --> 18:37.449
Lucky. Sometimes I get stuck opening
the bakery truck and it's a nightmare.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.367
Oh, how early?

18:38.450 --> 18:41.036
We're supposed to open at 6:00,
but I'm always late.

18:41.829 --> 18:44.748
-You ever get in trouble?
-No, people around here are cool.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.626
-So far no one's complained.
-Mm. Makes sense.

18:47.709 --> 18:52.256
-Everyone I've met has been super nice.
-So you think I'm nice?

18:53.382 --> 18:56.885
Well, you don't know me
and you offered to show me around.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.345
That's pretty nice.

18:58.428 --> 19:00.264
I figured it'd be better than working.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.517
So you'd rather pedal boat
with a stranger than work?

19:03.600 --> 19:07.896
Depends who that stranger is.
If he's a serial killer, then no.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.774
So to be clear,
you're not into serial killers.

19:10.858 --> 19:13.110
-Correct.
-Anything else I should know?

19:13.902 --> 19:15.070
Not at the moment.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.531
-How come?
-Because, like you said,

19:17.614 --> 19:19.074
we're strangers.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.994
I'm not just gonna tell you
my whole life story.

19:33.922 --> 19:37.968
Oh, hi, there, stranger.
Good to see you up and at 'em.

19:38.051 --> 19:40.888
I may be up,
but I don't know about at 'em.

19:41.638 --> 19:43.056
-Coffee, please.
-Yeah.

19:44.308 --> 19:47.519
-Did you get the flowers that we sent you?
-Yes.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.480
I don't-- I don't recall what kind.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.526
Oh. Still, you look great.

19:55.485 --> 19:58.572
You look a lot better
than you did in the hospital.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.699
How would you know that?

20:01.450 --> 20:03.118
Well, Mel and I visited you.

20:04.578 --> 20:05.621
More than once.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.166
How much do I owe you?

20:09.249 --> 20:11.710
Come on, your money's no good here.
You know that.

20:11.793 --> 20:14.296
Oh. Funny way to run a business.

20:15.255 --> 20:17.925
You're gonna be Kate
in <i>Taming of the Shrew.</i>

20:18.008 --> 20:21.970
You know my off-off-Broadway Kate
garnered rave reviews.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.889
That performance was 30 years ago.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.182
Act your age.

20:25.265 --> 20:28.810
Well, like Joan Collins,
I believe that age is just a number.

20:28.894 --> 20:32.689
And I believe I'll win the lottery.
We all have our fantasies.

20:32.773 --> 20:35.817
-Whose team am I on?

20:35.901 --> 20:37.402
You can be on my team.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.239
Can I do that for you?

20:40.322 --> 20:42.032
Just give me a minute.

20:42.115 --> 20:42.950
Okay.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.453
Sorry, I'm late.

20:46.536 --> 20:48.372
-Hi.
-Hey.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.791
-Hi.
-What are you doing here?

20:51.833 --> 20:55.504
-Um...
-We invited Tara to be part of the group.

20:55.587 --> 20:58.632
She plays cards and her cross-stitch
is impeccable.

20:59.758 --> 21:03.011
Why would you ever wanna hang around
with a bunch of old ladies?

21:05.722 --> 21:08.809
What? It's-- It's just a question.

21:09.393 --> 21:13.814
Being with you makes me feel closer
to my mom and I miss her a lot.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.984
We all miss her, dear.

21:17.651 --> 21:20.821
We're just so happy
to spend time with you.

21:21.697 --> 21:24.616
See, this is why
I didn't want to come today.

21:24.700 --> 21:28.787
One wrong question
and we're all crying about Lilly.

21:29.579 --> 21:34.334
I told Vernon I wasn't ready to go out,
but did he listen to me? No.

21:41.466 --> 21:46.430
Tara, I'm sorry if you feel like
I was being rude. It was not my intention.

21:46.513 --> 21:47.723
No, that's okay.

21:48.849 --> 21:51.727
-Let's just play, yeah?
-Yeah.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.855
Actually, I-- I want to go home.

21:59.192 --> 22:00.193
Hope.

22:00.277 --> 22:01.611
I shouldn't have come.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.322
Don't. It's all right.

22:13.081 --> 22:15.292
You won't know if you like it
unless you try it.

22:15.375 --> 22:16.960
I think I'm in the wrong class.

22:17.044 --> 22:19.046
This class is for beginners.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.172
Okay, then.

22:25.093 --> 22:26.053
Excellent.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.388
Now, let's begin.

22:29.431 --> 22:30.432
<i>Hai!</i>

22:37.773 --> 22:40.150
<i>-Onegaishimasu.</i>
<i>-Onegaishimasu.</i>

22:41.276 --> 22:43.820
Now, let's partner up. Henry.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.239
-What's your name?
-Preacher.

22:46.323 --> 22:48.325
Henry, you'll be demonstrating
for Preacher.

22:48.408 --> 22:50.577
-Why do I get the old guy?
-Henry...

22:50.660 --> 22:52.913
-Fine.
-Thank you.

22:52.996 --> 22:55.999
Okay. So, how does this all work, huh?

22:59.503 --> 23:02.047
This class is only an hour, right?

23:08.887 --> 23:10.055
All right.

23:12.808 --> 23:15.602
-What's wrong?
-Sometimes babies are a little bit shy.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.312
It's all right.

23:17.395 --> 23:19.523
Okay, one more big push, okay?

23:19.606 --> 23:21.525
-I can't. I'm too tired.
-Hey.

23:21.608 --> 23:23.360
Lee, look at me. Look at me.

23:23.443 --> 23:24.903
Just one more.

23:26.571 --> 23:27.739
You got it.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.241
Keep going.

23:29.324 --> 23:32.035
Okay, good girl. Okay.

23:33.078 --> 23:33.912
Okay.

23:35.413 --> 23:36.414
It's a girl.

23:36.998 --> 23:38.041
Okay.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.168
Why isn't she crying?

23:41.711 --> 23:42.796
Any response?

23:44.214 --> 23:45.257
No.

23:45.340 --> 23:46.925
-Do something!
-BVM?

23:47.008 --> 23:47.843
Yeah.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.263
Here you go.

23:52.013 --> 23:52.931
Okay.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.851
Why isn't she breathing?

23:57.769 --> 23:58.728
Clamping.

24:01.731 --> 24:02.607
Cutting.

24:06.987 --> 24:08.029
Create a central line.

24:13.326 --> 24:14.411
Come on.

24:16.663 --> 24:17.539
Okay.

24:22.502 --> 24:23.670
All right.

24:50.238 --> 24:51.573
Stop compressions.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.412
Marking time of death as--

24:57.495 --> 24:59.706
No! No!

25:05.295 --> 25:07.339
-Is that--? Okay.
-It's another contraction.

25:08.548 --> 25:09.716
What's happening?

25:09.799 --> 25:11.343
Another baby is coming.

25:12.260 --> 25:14.888
-Okay.

25:14.971 --> 25:15.805
Okay.

25:28.610 --> 25:29.694
How's it going?

25:30.862 --> 25:33.281
Well, I'm in his room.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.244
-But he's still unconscious.
<i>-Okay.</i>

25:37.327 --> 25:40.121
How'd it go with dad?
Did you find out why he's here?

25:40.205 --> 25:42.415
Yeah, they wanna know
when you're coming home.

25:42.958 --> 25:45.543
<i>Mom's using Dad to do her dirty work.</i>

25:45.627 --> 25:48.546
<i>She's been bugging me about coming back</i>
<i>to Sacramento for weeks.</i>

25:48.630 --> 25:50.048
Well, she wants to know.

25:50.674 --> 25:51.967
Well, I'm an adult.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.177
She doesn't need to know
everything I'm doing.

25:54.261 --> 25:57.222
All right, you can tell Dad that yourself
when you see him next

25:57.305 --> 25:59.557
because we're no longer on speaking terms.

26:00.183 --> 26:01.309
<i>Already?</i>

26:02.102 --> 26:05.897
Uh-huh. It took less than 10 minutes.
I think that might be a new record.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.148
All right.

26:07.232 --> 26:10.277
Well, as soon as I talk to Brady,
I'll deal with Dad for you, okay?

26:10.777 --> 26:13.154
<i>If you don't,</i>
<i>I'm gonna invite Mom up for a visit.</i>

26:13.238 --> 26:14.739
-You wouldn't.
<i>-Bye.</i>

26:27.627 --> 26:30.255
Hey. Who's that guy with your girlfriend?

26:30.338 --> 26:32.257
She's not my girlfriend.

26:33.091 --> 26:35.302
-Did I miss something?
-We sort of broke up.

26:35.385 --> 26:37.137
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.180
Yeah, it sucks,
but it was kind of my fault.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.515
It was totally your fault.

26:40.598 --> 26:42.058
-Thanks, Jack.
-You're welcome.

26:43.059 --> 26:45.270
Well, if it was your fault,
why don't you fix it?

26:45.353 --> 26:48.481
-She's on a date with somebody else.
-Quit being such a wuss.

26:48.565 --> 26:51.109
Women want someone
who will fight for them.

26:51.693 --> 26:55.947
If you want her back,
make her an offer she can't refuse.

26:56.031 --> 26:58.450
-Wasn't that a line from <i>The Godfather?</i>
-Yeah.

26:59.617 --> 27:00.869
But it works.

27:04.956 --> 27:06.249
Mr. Sudder.

27:06.333 --> 27:07.876
Staff Sergeant Gomez.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.838
-I thought we should talk.
-Tell me I got into

27:11.921 --> 27:15.133
-the Officer Candidates course.
-Sorry, still don't have any openings.

27:16.926 --> 27:17.802
So, now what?

27:18.511 --> 27:20.555
Maybe I should reconsider
joining the Navy.

27:20.638 --> 27:23.183
I mean, I could still get
into the Raiders as a doc.

27:23.266 --> 27:25.393
If I were you,
I'd sign a general contract.

27:25.477 --> 27:28.521
Get your basic out of the way
while you wait for a spot at Quantico.

27:32.567 --> 27:35.111
If I do that,
when would I leave for boot camp?

27:35.195 --> 27:39.240
Phase one, MCRD San Diego
starts in less than two weeks.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.409
-Can I think about it?
-Absolutely.

27:41.493 --> 27:44.662
But a good soldier follows his gut.
Takes action.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.729
The ambulance is on its way.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.530
Can I hold her sister?

28:19.072 --> 28:21.241
Of course. Of course.

28:41.636 --> 28:43.221
My sweet Daisy.

28:46.391 --> 28:48.435
What happens when we go to the hospital?

28:48.518 --> 28:51.604
An OBGYN will check on Mom

28:51.688 --> 28:54.649
and a pediatrician will examine Iris.

28:55.233 --> 28:57.444
You'll also meet with a social worker

28:58.027 --> 29:03.950
who will register the stillbirth
and counsel you on end-of-life planning.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.208
I'm so very sorry for your loss.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.004
You did everything you could.

29:22.302 --> 29:25.054
I'll let you two have some time. Okay.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.164
-Preacher.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.501
-Thank you, Henry.

29:54.584 --> 29:55.919
You look familiar.

29:56.503 --> 29:59.255
-Have you ever used a headhunting service?
-No.

29:59.756 --> 30:03.259
Oh, that's my other job.
I teach Aikido between client meetings.

30:03.343 --> 30:05.553
It sounds like, you know,
a tough schedule.

30:05.637 --> 30:09.307
That's my own fault.
I love teaching and I love recruiting.

30:09.390 --> 30:11.226
I couldn't pick between the two.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.645
If you enjoy what you do,
it doesn't feel like work.

30:13.728 --> 30:14.771
Exactly.

30:15.355 --> 30:17.732
So, is this your first class?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.692
What gave it away, huh?

30:19.776 --> 30:22.821
My outfit or the fact
that a 13-year-old dropped me?

30:22.904 --> 30:26.241
Well, in Aikido, age and size
have nothing to do with strength.

30:26.324 --> 30:28.701
Yeah. Well, that was obvious.

30:29.202 --> 30:30.662
You'll learn to be successful.

30:30.745 --> 30:33.456
Your inner energy must be harmonious
with your outer self.

30:33.540 --> 30:37.293
Yeah, well, I was a Marine.
So, harmony wasn't exactly their priority.

30:37.877 --> 30:40.338
Then Aikido might be
a welcome change for you.

30:41.297 --> 30:45.802
The class on Friday is mostly adults.
I hope to see you again, Preacher.

31:03.736 --> 31:05.947
-Brie.
-Hi!

31:10.159 --> 31:12.203
-What are you doing here?
-I need you to know.

31:12.745 --> 31:16.124
Jack's memory came back.
He knows you didn't shoot him.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.757
-I told you I was framed.
-I know.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.218
And I'm so sorry I didn't believe you.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.220
It's just...

31:29.971 --> 31:31.347
I've been burned in the past.

31:31.431 --> 31:33.474
I have a really hard time trusting people.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.226
You don't need to explain yourself.

31:35.310 --> 31:37.854
No, I do,
because I haven't been honest with you.

31:38.897 --> 31:39.981
What do you mean?

31:40.565 --> 31:44.485
You remember when you told me
you were falling in love with me?

31:45.069 --> 31:45.904
Yeah.

31:48.114 --> 31:49.407
I didn't say anything

31:49.490 --> 31:53.369
because I was too afraid to tell you
that I was already in love with you.

31:54.954 --> 31:58.499
Then last night happened and I didn't
think that I would get the chance, and...

31:58.583 --> 31:59.417
Hey.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.003
You don't need to cry.

32:02.837 --> 32:03.838
I'm right here.

32:04.505 --> 32:05.340
Okay?

32:06.549 --> 32:08.134
Everything's gonna be all right.

32:10.261 --> 32:11.721
I'm gonna get you home.

32:13.181 --> 32:14.140
I promise.

32:15.683 --> 32:16.643
I love you.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.026
-Hey.
-<i>Hey.</i>

32:25.109 --> 32:29.238
I just wanted to call and find out
how things are going with your dad.

32:29.864 --> 32:33.952
<i>Uh, he lectured me on the importance</i>
<i>of the nuclear family.</i>

32:34.035 --> 32:36.329
Oh. So it was bad.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.916
Yeah, well, he walked out
in the middle of the conversation.

32:40.917 --> 32:43.086
Jo Ellen said he's leaving town
in the morning.

32:43.169 --> 32:44.128
Aw.

32:44.879 --> 32:48.216
It's gonna be really hard to patch
things up once he's back in Sacramento.

32:48.758 --> 32:50.385
Yeah, but I'm not the problem here.

32:50.885 --> 32:53.763
<i>Oh, no, no.</i>
<i>Babe, I didn't mean it like that.</i>

32:54.514 --> 32:56.641
Do you wanna have a relationship with him?

32:57.433 --> 33:00.144
If it's gonna be like this, no.
I don't think I do.

33:01.312 --> 33:02.897
What if you could patch things up?

33:05.233 --> 33:06.067
I just...

33:07.986 --> 33:10.363
If I can't have a relationship
with my own father,

33:10.446 --> 33:12.073
what kind of a dad am I gonna be?

33:12.156 --> 33:15.952
Oh, no matter what happens with Sam,
you're gonna be an incredible father.

33:18.121 --> 33:21.958
You know, this is about
what you want from him.

33:22.583 --> 33:26.421
-A little respect would be nice.
<i>-Well, go and tell him that.</i>

33:27.588 --> 33:29.924
<i>You know,</i>
<i>if he doesn't come around then...</i>

33:31.175 --> 33:33.011
...<i>at least you know you tried.</i>

33:33.678 --> 33:35.263
Well, he's pretty stubborn.

33:35.346 --> 33:37.015
Oh, so that's genetic.

33:38.641 --> 33:39.475
You're funny.

33:41.185 --> 33:44.856
All right, look, I'll give it one more
shot, but after that, I think I'm done.

33:45.481 --> 33:47.025
Well, that's fair enough.

33:49.277 --> 33:50.737
You okay? How's your day going?

33:54.032 --> 33:57.035
Um, it's good. I delivered a baby.

33:57.827 --> 33:58.828
<i>Aw...</i>

33:59.912 --> 34:01.831
<i>You don't sound very excited.</i>

34:03.666 --> 34:05.126
No, I'm just tired.

34:05.918 --> 34:08.296
When you get home from Hope's,
try to get some rest.

34:09.213 --> 34:10.048
Yeah.

34:11.090 --> 34:12.258
Yeah, I'll do that.

34:13.384 --> 34:14.844
Anyway, I love you.

34:15.428 --> 34:16.387
I love you, too.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.650
I've lost my damn mind.

34:30.276 --> 34:34.614
It's like my mouth is no longer connected
to my brain.

34:35.990 --> 34:41.037
Words come out before I even have a chance
to think about what I'm saying.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.581
Hope, I am so sorry
that you're going through this.

34:43.664 --> 34:46.250
I don't understand what's happening.

34:46.334 --> 34:49.378
Well with TBIs, sights, sounds and people

34:49.462 --> 34:53.174
can all trigger really strong
emotional responses.

34:54.050 --> 34:56.052
I saw Tara this morning.

34:58.262 --> 35:00.890
I made her really uncomfortable.

35:01.474 --> 35:04.977
It's okay. You haven't had much time
to process your grief over Lilly.

35:05.061 --> 35:07.897
That's no excuse. I was downright...

35:08.940 --> 35:11.025
um, unsocial.

35:11.109 --> 35:15.363
Listen, everybody knows what you're going
through and no one is judging you.

35:15.446 --> 35:16.781
I'm judging me!

35:20.118 --> 35:21.953
How long is this going to last?

35:24.789 --> 35:25.790
They don't know,

35:26.499 --> 35:30.920
but with time and therapy,
you will get better.

35:31.504 --> 35:34.715
So, until then
I should just crawl under a rock.

35:34.799 --> 35:35.800
No. It's...

35:36.467 --> 35:38.886
Look, it's not like
flipping a switch, okay?

35:38.970 --> 35:40.888
The process is just going to be gradual.

35:42.431 --> 35:44.600
-I can't do this.
-Yes, you can.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.186
Yes, you can, Hope.

35:47.270 --> 35:51.357
You are one of the strongest people
that I have ever met in my life.

35:54.402 --> 35:56.445
Help me get my life back.

35:59.115 --> 36:00.908
Hey. Yeah.

36:16.465 --> 36:18.050
Jo Ellen said I'd find you here.

36:20.219 --> 36:21.053
Can I sit?

36:35.860 --> 36:39.780
Look, I know you don't approve
of my choices,

36:39.864 --> 36:43.576
but that shouldn't mean
that we can't have a civil conversation.

36:46.162 --> 36:49.248
I just don't understand why you
always have to go against the grain.

36:50.833 --> 36:51.792
What does that mean?

36:53.252 --> 36:55.463
You had a full academic scholarship
to Berkeley

36:55.546 --> 36:57.506
and you threw it all away to play soldier.

36:57.590 --> 36:59.175
I wasn't playing anything.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.178
I enlisted to serve my country.

37:02.261 --> 37:05.681
Well, you could have at least gone back
to school after your tour ended.

37:06.265 --> 37:07.642
You could've become something.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.936
I did become something.
I own my own business.

37:10.019 --> 37:13.773
You have a brilliant mind
and you're wasting it serving drinks.

37:13.856 --> 37:15.441
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

37:16.692 --> 37:20.112
I'm living the life that I want. I don't
know why you can't understand that.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.283
When I was growing up,

37:24.992 --> 37:28.162
my father insisted
that I follow in his footsteps.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.581
If you didn't wanna teach,
why didn't you push back?

37:30.665 --> 37:33.960
In those days, respecting your parents
meant doing what you were told.

37:34.043 --> 37:37.129
I enlisted because it was my dream,
not because I didn't respect you.

37:37.213 --> 37:39.173
I thought you enlisted to get back at me.

37:39.257 --> 37:43.302
-Back at you for what?
-We never agreed on anything.

37:43.386 --> 37:47.306
My decision had nothing to do with you.
I wanted to be a Marine since I was a kid.

37:47.890 --> 37:52.937
Son, at 18, you didn't have the experience
to understand consequences.

37:53.020 --> 37:54.438
I was trying to protect you.

37:54.522 --> 37:56.649
I didn't need protecting.
I needed support.

37:56.732 --> 37:58.985
My job was to make sure
you didn't ruin your life.

37:59.068 --> 38:00.945
When you have your own kids,
you'll understand.

38:01.028 --> 38:04.365
When I have my own kids,
I will support them no matter what.

38:05.741 --> 38:09.287
So you can honestly say
that you're satisfied with your life here?

38:09.370 --> 38:10.288
Yeah.

38:12.456 --> 38:13.291
I can.

38:16.252 --> 38:21.048
And I wish that you could accept that
there's more than one way to live a life.

38:22.967 --> 38:25.219
You're not the first person
to tell me that.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.430
Well, that might be something
to think about.

38:30.182 --> 38:31.017
Okay.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.144
I hear you.

38:33.227 --> 38:34.729
But do you understand me?

38:36.022 --> 38:37.315
I'm trying.

38:44.071 --> 38:47.783
And I would like you
to meet my wife, Hope.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.785
Lizzie said she has a big personality.

38:50.995 --> 38:53.289
Yeah. Oh, she is a character,

38:53.372 --> 38:57.293
but she's got the biggest heart
you can imagine.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.713
Do you think she'd be okay with me
being here?

39:00.796 --> 39:01.922
Of course.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.176
And as a matter of fact,

39:05.259 --> 39:09.055
if you wanted to stay around Virgin River
for a little while,

39:09.138 --> 39:12.433
I mean, we could get to know
each other better.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.227
-Really?
-I mean, if that's something you want.

39:15.311 --> 39:18.064
Yeah. Yeah, I'd really like that.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.443
Do you need to run that by your parents?

39:22.526 --> 39:25.654
Actually, my mother died
when I was a baby.

39:25.738 --> 39:27.031
Oh, I'm sorry.

39:27.114 --> 39:29.367
Thanks, but my dad and my grandma
raised me.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.535
Ah. Are you close to them?

39:31.619 --> 39:32.953
To my grandma, very.

39:33.037 --> 39:34.372
And your dad?

39:35.081 --> 39:36.082
Best friends.

39:36.165 --> 39:37.416
Oh.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.793
That is wonderful.

39:39.460 --> 39:42.505
It sounds like he takes after Rose
and not me.

39:42.588 --> 39:43.798
What do you mean?

39:43.881 --> 39:48.135
Oh, Rose was... She was sweet as pie.

39:49.136 --> 39:53.224
But I am what some people call
a curmudgeon.

39:53.933 --> 39:55.601
Well, you seem perfectly nice to me.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.648
Maybe this is too soon.

40:00.731 --> 40:03.567
Maybe it's just too forward...

40:04.860 --> 40:08.489
but do you think your dad
might want to meet me?

40:09.615 --> 40:10.574
He can't.

40:10.658 --> 40:12.743
Yeah. Oh, no. I understand.

40:13.327 --> 40:16.831
If he wanted to see me,
he probably just would have come with you.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.040
No, it's not that.

40:19.417 --> 40:20.626
Um...

40:22.294 --> 40:24.422
He died last month.

40:25.714 --> 40:26.882
Oh, God.

40:35.099 --> 40:37.810
We have company.

40:39.728 --> 40:42.731
-Oh, hi.
-Apologies for showing up unannounced.

40:42.815 --> 40:45.317
Jack insisted my being here
wouldn't be an imposition.

40:45.401 --> 40:48.863
-Absolutely not. We have plenty of food.
-That's very kind of you.

40:48.946 --> 40:51.740
-I'd like to wash my hands. Excuse me.
-Door on the right.

40:51.824 --> 40:52.658
Yeah.

40:55.953 --> 41:00.124
-So, I guess things went well.
-Well, a lot better than this morning.

41:00.708 --> 41:02.376
-I'm sorry.
-No, no, no. Shh.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.462
Thanks to you,
everything's out in the open.

41:04.545 --> 41:06.422
I think there's a shift between us.

41:07.006 --> 41:10.968
-Does he know about my pregnancy?
-No, no, no.

41:11.051 --> 41:13.679
I think one pregnancy at a time is enough.
Don't you?

41:13.762 --> 41:16.849
That's perfectly reasonable.
I will not say anything.

41:17.683 --> 41:18.976
-Go and relax.
-Really?

41:19.059 --> 41:21.979
-I'll finish prepping. Yeah.
-Okay. Thank you.

41:23.606 --> 41:26.901
Just got a text from Brie.
She's just now leaving the hospital.

41:27.401 --> 41:30.112
Said, "Go ahead and eat,"
she'd get here as soon as she can.

41:30.196 --> 41:32.198
We can put her food in the warmer.

41:32.281 --> 41:34.158
In the meantime, you want wine?

41:34.241 --> 41:35.534
Does a bird have wings?

41:48.964 --> 41:50.049
How's Brady doing?

41:51.383 --> 41:52.301
Excuse me?

41:53.010 --> 41:55.095
I warned him
something like this might happen.

41:55.179 --> 41:59.975
It's a shame,
but prison is a dangerous place after all.

42:01.560 --> 42:05.606
-Ah. My family's waiting for me, so...
-This will only take a second.

42:07.274 --> 42:08.817
I want you to tell your boyfriend

42:08.901 --> 42:12.738
to get Emerald Lumbers' side business
up and running.

42:13.239 --> 42:14.949
You know he's incarcerated.

42:17.743 --> 42:18.577
Look...

42:19.954 --> 42:23.624
Just tell him Calvin says as long as
he plays ball, everyone will be just fine.

42:24.875 --> 42:26.085
Yourself included.

42:29.463 --> 42:30.881
Have a nice evening.

42:40.432 --> 42:41.725
Goddamn.

42:47.731 --> 42:51.318
Mom wanted to hire a plumber,
but no, Dad insisted on fixing it himself.

42:51.402 --> 42:53.988
Wait a minute. Did you even know
how to fix a dishwasher?

42:54.071 --> 42:54.989
No.

42:55.072 --> 42:57.825
Two minutes in, the pipe breaks,
the whole kitchen's flooded.

42:57.908 --> 43:00.119
In my defense,
the plumbing in that house was crap.

43:00.202 --> 43:01.036
Okay.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.454
What did your mom say?

43:02.538 --> 43:04.039
She thought it was funny.

43:05.165 --> 43:06.417
Eventually.

43:10.963 --> 43:13.090
About your mother. Um...

43:15.509 --> 43:17.761
I was hoping to tell you
and Brie together,

43:17.845 --> 43:20.848
but obviously that's not gonna happen.

43:21.682 --> 43:22.933
Tell us what?

43:24.977 --> 43:26.437
This isn't ideal.

43:27.646 --> 43:31.233
Um, you know, if you need some privacy,
I can go outside.

43:31.317 --> 43:32.151
No.

43:33.527 --> 43:35.988
No. Whatever you got to say,
you can say with Mel here.

43:36.905 --> 43:39.491
Well, in that case...

43:42.745 --> 43:44.413
Your mother wants a divorce.
