[Pete] "Food was my life.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.148
I ate all day. I ate in my sleep.

01:05.231 --> 01:07.025
I even ate whilst I was eating.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.488
I consumated more than some countries.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.406
I wore size blimp".

01:13.490 --> 01:17.077
Aw, he's just big boned,
kind of debonair-looking, if you ask me.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.329
"And this is me today".

01:19.412 --> 01:24.584
-[raucous laughter]
-Hello, Mr. Bones!

01:25.377 --> 01:29.381
Hiya, Pete! Guess what I'm doing!

01:29.464 --> 01:32.217
Mmm-hmm. Boy, ain't you something?

01:32.300 --> 01:34.135
Now just quiet down before
I call the police again.

01:34.386 --> 01:40.266
"With the lickety-split diet plan,
I lost over 700 pounds in just five days".

01:40.350 --> 01:43.478
I'm doing what they call
anemic exercising.

01:43.561 --> 01:46.356
Gets the cardio-vehicular system tuned up.

01:46.439 --> 01:51.027
"Lickety-split will pay you
big bucks to lose inches.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.029
Send your picture and current weight

01:53.113 --> 01:57.117
and we'll send a supply of
diet bars for only $79.99".

01:57.200 --> 01:59.911
[mumbling]

01:59.994 --> 02:04.374
"...25 bucks a pound for every
pound up to 1,000 pounds".

02:05.291 --> 02:12.257
It's good for the heart...
The legs... the arms... ow!

02:12.382 --> 02:15.927
-[groans]
-But not the head. Hmm.

02:16.011 --> 02:19.806
Twenty five pesos per
square foot of paunch, huh?

02:20.390 --> 02:23.143
Ah, too bad I'm in such good shape.

02:24.060 --> 02:27.147
Lousy, cheap, defective raft.

02:29.566 --> 02:32.485
[grumbles] Cheap, defective pool.

02:32.610 --> 02:38.158
Well, maybe I could find
a couple of bucks' worth of flesh to shed.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.375
[brakes screeching]

02:47.459 --> 02:50.879
[tires screeching]

02:50.962 --> 02:54.883
Oh, my favourite three words
in the English vocabulary...

02:54.966 --> 02:57.218
Money, money, and money. Hah!

02:57.302 --> 03:00.597
And before long,
that's just what I'll be rolling in.

03:01.473 --> 03:05.101
Hmm, not bad for reconstituted cardboard.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.855
Pete, are you snacking
between snacks again?

03:08.938 --> 03:10.732
[gulping]

03:10.815 --> 03:14.527
For your information,
these are lo-Cal, high-fiber,

03:14.611 --> 03:17.197
top-notch weight loss bars...

03:17.280 --> 03:19.032
-[belching]
-Excuse me, with nuts.

03:19.115 --> 03:21.618
At least take the wrapper off first.

03:21.701 --> 03:26.206
I'm gonna lose major poundage
and get paid for doing it.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.209
I feel lighter already.

03:29.292 --> 03:32.420
But it says here you're only
supposed to eat one bar per meal.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.756
Well, then,
I guess you better get cooking.

03:34.839 --> 03:36.174
I've had half a dozen of them.

03:36.257 --> 03:39.260
So I need six meals to
make this system work.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.679
Fat chance.

03:40.762 --> 03:44.516
Oh, Pete, I don't want an attractive,
athletic man with a good physique.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.393
I want you.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.978
And besides,
you know you never stick to diets.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.981
You don't think I can do it, do ya?

03:52.065 --> 03:55.318
In one word, no,
I don't think you can do it, Pete.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.612
[grumbling] That's more than one word.

03:57.696 --> 04:00.824
[chuckling] And that's more than
one spare tire.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.826
Then I'll do it alone.

04:02.909 --> 04:06.413
I'll see you around.
And if you don't recognize me,

04:06.496 --> 04:08.748
I'll be the rich, skinny guy.

04:08.832 --> 04:12.627
[grunting] Cheap, defective doorway.

04:15.213 --> 04:18.550
Well, now, let's see how much
weight I lost last night.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.638
I couldn't have gained!

04:23.722 --> 04:26.016
[screaming]

04:26.099 --> 04:28.601
Dropping more weight, Pete?

04:28.685 --> 04:30.895
[Pete] Whoa!

04:30.979 --> 04:32.272
[coughing]

04:34.566 --> 04:37.360
Cheap, defective scale.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.529
[Waffles yowling]

04:39.612 --> 04:42.949
Oh, getting that dough is
gonna be harder than I thought.

04:43.491 --> 04:46.453
All I need is a picture of
me minus a pound or 200.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.789
[straining] Got to get this
hamstring unstrung.

04:49.873 --> 04:54.085
Of course, it wouldn't have to
be a picture of me prezactly.

04:54.169 --> 04:59.341
So long as it was somebody nice
and skinny and scrawny and boney...

04:59.841 --> 05:02.761
-Like the Goof.
-[grunting]

05:02.844 --> 05:05.347
Have to make sure I'm loose and limburger

05:05.764 --> 05:07.515
or I could injure myself.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.642
-Hi, Dad.
-Morning, Mr G.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.562
Where are you boys off to at
half past the crack of dawn?

05:12.645 --> 05:15.815
Oh, today's the start of the school
fundraising cookie sale, sir.

05:15.899 --> 05:19.486
Whoever sells the most cookies
gets a certificate of appreciation.

05:19.569 --> 05:23.490
Not to mention two front row
seats to the rock concert.

05:24.074 --> 05:28.328
Put me down for a box of chocolate
cookies, the vanilla kind.

05:28.411 --> 05:31.581
Come on, Peej.
We want to move merchandise.

05:31.664 --> 05:35.126
Morning there, Goof! How's everything?

05:35.210 --> 05:39.047
Well, hiya, Pete.
I was just heading off on my power walk.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.342
[chuckling] Well, this is great.

05:42.425 --> 05:45.637
Mind if I power along, neighbour?

05:45.720 --> 05:50.517
Well, sure! Glad to see you
appreciate the value of exercising.

05:50.600 --> 05:55.689
Yeah. Well, you know me, Goof.
Uh... my body's a temple and...

05:55.772 --> 05:59.275
Oh, no! A man fell out of an airplane.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.529
-Where?
-Right up there! [screaming]

06:02.612 --> 06:04.114
[thudding]

06:04.197 --> 06:07.033
No, Pete,
I think that's a telephone pole.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.494
Come on, Petey, think light thoughts.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.705
Just empty your head, like me.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.505
Now this is good for the lower back,

06:20.588 --> 06:23.717
the upper thigh, and outer limits
of the inner clavicle. Ah-hyuck!

06:26.845 --> 06:28.888
Feeling the burn, are ya? Ah-hyuck!

06:28.972 --> 06:32.308
Well, like they say, "no pain, no Spain".

06:32.392 --> 06:38.064
Or no rain, no plain. Or no train...
Uh, no, that ain't it...

06:38.148 --> 06:41.484
Don't move! There's a big,
ugly black thing on your nose! Quick!

06:41.568 --> 06:43.570
-Close your eyes!
-I think that is my nose.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.120
Cheap, defective camera.

06:52.203 --> 06:55.081
Say, what are you doing there, Petey?

06:55.165 --> 07:00.462
[stammering] Well, I'm...
I mean, what I was doing was...

07:00.545 --> 07:05.383
I was trying to take your
picture, oh, idol of mine.

07:05.467 --> 07:08.720
Well, if you want my picture,
why don't you just say so?

07:08.803 --> 07:12.098
[laughs] I want your picture.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.768
Okey-dokey! [chuckles] Shoot!

07:14.851 --> 07:20.815
[laughs] I'd love to, Goof,
but all I got is this camera.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.735
[camera clicks]

07:23.818 --> 07:27.322
[wheels squeaking]

07:27.405 --> 07:29.699
[panting] Oh, Max,
we're gonna have to knock

07:29.783 --> 07:33.119
on every door in town to get
rid of all these cookies.

07:33.203 --> 07:37.624
-Door-to-door? Are you kidding?
-Well, who're we gonna sell them to?

07:37.707 --> 07:41.544
To the two biggest appetites
in all of Spoonerville.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.883
Sorry, boys, but I'm gonna
have to make it just one box.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.928
If I eat those cookies,
they go right to my lips.

07:50.011 --> 07:53.807
-Or is that my hips?
-[both groaning]

07:53.890 --> 07:57.644
OK, OK,
give me everything $1.50 will buy.

07:57.727 --> 08:01.147
Now what? Your dad's too
skinny and my dad's too cheap.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.486
I'll be so rich I'll need my
own bank to hold all the money.

08:09.406 --> 08:13.618
[Burt] Incredible! Fantastic!
Beyond belief!

08:13.702 --> 08:15.829
After, and before!

08:15.912 --> 08:19.833
Boy, I wouldn't have recognized
him if it hadn't been for the hat!

08:19.916 --> 08:23.420
What a creature!
The perfect lickety-split weight-loss man!

08:23.503 --> 08:26.631
Get him on the phone.
I'll build a national ad campaign

08:26.715 --> 08:27.549
around this Adonis.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.843
[telephone ringing]

08:29.926 --> 08:35.932
Hello? Who? No, there's no Adonis here.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.101
I... oh! Give me that!

08:38.184 --> 08:42.355
Your roast's burning,
and the baby's diaper needs changing,

08:42.439 --> 08:44.190
and there's a cab out front.

08:44.274 --> 08:47.110
Pete, I don't have a roast
and we don't have a baby.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.362
Well, then, whose cab is that?

08:51.031 --> 08:53.908
Ahem! Hello?

08:53.992 --> 08:57.787
[Burt] Whoa!
Got your pictures! Fantastic!

08:57.871 --> 08:59.539
Yeah, right. Well, I...
I never could've done it

08:59.622 --> 09:01.541
without your outstanding dietary product.

09:01.624 --> 09:04.127
Now about those 25 bucks a pound...

09:04.294 --> 09:07.255
You're gonna put lickety-split on the map!

09:07.339 --> 09:10.175
Yeah, ain't life grand?
Now, I lost 180 pounds.

09:10.258 --> 09:13.011
I make that 4,500 simoleons,

09:13.094 --> 09:15.972
but let's just round it off
to an even 10 grand. [laughs]

09:16.056 --> 09:17.807
So if you wanna cut a check...

09:17.891 --> 09:21.061
Of course I'll need pictures,
interviews, family history, the works!

09:21.144 --> 09:22.979
I'll be at your house in three days.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.649
You'll what? Interview? Uh, no!

09:26.733 --> 09:30.653
I got incurable shyness,
and I can't talk to strange strangers.

09:30.737 --> 09:31.821
I break out in chives, get lockjaw.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.907
[chuckles nervously] Pictures?

09:33.990 --> 09:35.450
Well, you can't have my picture took.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.869
Er... superstitious, you know?

09:37.952 --> 09:39.746
Camera steals the soul, yeah.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.165
I signed an agreement?
You sure about that?

09:42.248 --> 09:45.794
Uh, breach of promise? Restraining order?

09:45.877 --> 09:47.587
Firstborn male child?

09:47.671 --> 09:53.635
Well, in that case,
I'll, I'll, I'll see you in three days.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.095
[sobbing loudly]

09:57.555 --> 09:59.933
I got 72 hours to lose 180 pounds.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.935
That's nearly 10 pounds a day.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.646
[straining]

10:04.729 --> 10:07.273
Hey, what's wrong with this thing?

10:07.357 --> 10:09.943
Uh-oh! Oh, boy! Hold on...

10:10.026 --> 10:11.194
[screams]

10:13.655 --> 10:14.823
[coughing weakly]

10:14.906 --> 10:16.825
-Cheap, defective...
-[honks]

10:16.908 --> 10:18.993
[moaning]

10:21.162 --> 10:22.414
[humming]

10:33.508 --> 10:36.678
If I can't work the weight off,
I'll just sweat it off.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.851
[steam hissing]

10:42.934 --> 10:46.479
Ah! Just like one of them
Turkish steamy baths,

10:46.563 --> 10:49.399
and everybody knows
how skinny turkeys are.

10:49.649 --> 10:53.319
Whew! Another hour of this and I
ought to be a regular beanpole.

10:57.282 --> 11:00.160
-Oh, I bet I dropped a ton.
-[slippers squeaking]

11:00.243 --> 11:03.997
I ought to be down to skin
and bones by now... what!

11:04.080 --> 11:08.001
I only lost one eighth of
a quarter of a tenth of a pound?

11:08.084 --> 11:10.628
And only 48 more hours to go.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.467
-[rooster crowing]
-[Pete] I'll never make it.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.635
They'll find out I'm not the
Goof and the Goof's not me.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.597
They'll sue! They'll lock me
up and throw away the jail!

11:20.680 --> 11:24.976
Ooh, wait just one
lickety-splickity-second.

11:25.060 --> 11:29.356
I got it! I'll assume a new identity.
I'll change my name!

11:29.439 --> 11:32.776
[groans] That's how I got in
this mess in the first place.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.779
I know there's an answer
out there somewhere.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.782
I know it's gonna hit me any second now.

11:42.285 --> 11:45.038
[chuckling diabolically]
And it just did.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.503
[panting] Goofster, when was the last time

11:51.586 --> 11:53.880
I told ya how much
I admire and respect ya?

11:53.963 --> 11:55.965
Well, let me see now.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.843
I guess it's been about since,
uh... never.

11:58.927 --> 12:02.180
It's... it's funny, isn't it,
how we never verbalize,

12:02.263 --> 12:05.308
in our words,
our internalest-most feelings?

12:05.392 --> 12:07.435
[straining]

12:07.519 --> 12:11.106
And you know, my whole family
feels the same way about you.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.817
They do? Aw!

12:13.900 --> 12:17.278
Oh, yeah! They say, "Pete", which is me,

12:17.362 --> 12:20.407
they're always going,
"why can't you be more like that Goof"?

12:20.490 --> 12:21.741
[chuckles] That's what they say, yeah.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.576
They say that?

12:23.660 --> 12:27.997
[sniffling] No, I'm not gonna cry,
I'm not.

12:28.081 --> 12:32.210
No, Pete, don't do this to me.

12:32.293 --> 12:38.466
[straining] Goof, we love you like
you were a member of our own species.

12:38.550 --> 12:43.513
Oh, gosh, now I know I'm gonna... cry!

12:47.267 --> 12:52.355
Gee, Goof, this is a side of you
I've never seen before.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.274
[yelling] Now get off of me,
you blockheaded,

12:54.357 --> 12:56.026
boneheaded, lame-brained...

12:56.109 --> 13:01.364
I mean to say,
would you mind moving over just a skosh?

13:01.448 --> 13:04.701
Your posterior's crushing my exterior.

13:04.784 --> 13:09.456
[panting] Yes, I wanna make you
a little preposition here, pal.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.124
What's that, Pete?

13:11.207 --> 13:14.252
Well, I want you to show me how you do it.

13:14.336 --> 13:16.671
You know, how to run a family,

13:16.755 --> 13:20.508
how to make the dog fetch the paper
and not wet on anything.

13:20.592 --> 13:23.428
How to barbecue, how to sit and eat,

13:23.511 --> 13:27.307
and watch the ball game like
a real man-of-the-house.

13:27.390 --> 13:31.394
Gosh, Pete, I thought you
already knew that stuff.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.314
Oh, no, Goof. You see,

13:34.397 --> 13:38.151
it's all been an elaborate false facade.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.737
I'm a failure as a father, as a husband,

13:40.820 --> 13:43.490
and as a member of
the volunteer fire department.

13:43.573 --> 13:47.494
I am less than a worm.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.080
Aw, and all this time, I just thought

13:50.163 --> 13:52.832
you were short-tempered
and kind of selfish.

13:52.916 --> 13:56.628
No. That was a facade, too.

13:56.711 --> 14:01.299
[sniffling] Gee, Petey, you know
I'll do anything I can to help.

14:01.383 --> 14:04.803
Fine! Let's get you moved into my place
so I can observate you and learn from you.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.681
And just to make things all realistical,

14:07.764 --> 14:11.726
how's about we start calling you "Pete"?

14:11.810 --> 14:13.603
Well, OK, Pete.

14:13.687 --> 14:16.022
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

14:16.106 --> 14:19.526
Tell you what, why don't you call
me by my middle name from now on?

14:19.609 --> 14:21.945
And what name might that be?

14:22.028 --> 14:24.197
Goofy.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.908
Goofy. [chuckles]

14:26.991 --> 14:29.494
I like it. Got a familiar ring to it.

14:31.663 --> 14:35.125
[Pete] Yeah. Seems he's suffering some
sort of delusionary hallucinations

14:35.208 --> 14:36.876
brung on by a fever he
had in the third grade

14:36.960 --> 14:38.420
when he was bit by a rat.

14:38.503 --> 14:41.131
Yep, appears he's got a case
of chronic hero worship.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.342
On me, of course. Hah! Thinks he's me.

14:44.426 --> 14:47.721
Doc says we got to work him
through it real gentle-like.

14:47.846 --> 14:50.473
Since when have you cared about Goofy?

14:50.557 --> 14:54.561
Now, puddle-dumpling, I know we've
had our little downs and downs.

14:54.644 --> 14:58.398
But if that Goof and a fish was
drowning, I'd save Goofy,

14:58.481 --> 15:00.900
right after the fish.

15:00.984 --> 15:04.362
Now, I have decided to let
that Goof stay right here

15:04.446 --> 15:07.240
for a couple of days and pretend to be me.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.576
Just till he gets over this terrible
mental anguish, don't you know.

15:09.659 --> 15:12.662
Now, he's gonna want to act like me.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.581
In fact, you'll...

15:14.664 --> 15:16.666
You'll even have to call him Pete.
Go figure.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.252
So, just go play along with it, darling.

15:19.336 --> 15:23.423
You know, you don't wanna be responsible
for pushing that Goof over the edge.

15:23.506 --> 15:27.719
Well, all right,
if you're sure this is for the best.

15:27.802 --> 15:33.016
Oh, it is, Snookums.
[laughs deviously] It is.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.810
[doorbell rings]

15:35.894 --> 15:39.147
Welcome there,
Pete, my neighbour named Pete!

15:39.272 --> 15:41.524
Come on in and make
yourself at home, Pete.

15:41.608 --> 15:45.445
[chuckles] Sorry I'm late.
Had to set the mousetraps.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.530
Oops! Forgot to bring the cat.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.700
Forget that and get in here! Er... Pete.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.619
Thanks, Pete.

15:52.702 --> 15:56.289
I'm Goofy, remember? You're Pete.
Now repeat after me, Pete.

15:56.373 --> 15:58.875
-You're Pete, got it?
-[goofy] Got it, Pete.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.002
-Goofy!
-What?

16:01.086 --> 16:05.090
Uh... Max,
why are our dads switching names?

16:05.173 --> 16:06.841
You got me, Peej.

16:06.925 --> 16:10.845
What do you think you're doing?
That's my chair you're desecrating!

16:10.929 --> 16:15.475
[softly] Pete, have you forgotten?
Rat bite? Third grade?

16:15.558 --> 16:19.062
What are you talk...
Oh, yeah, that's right, I forgot.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.563
Goof bit that rat. Yeah.
[forced laughter]

16:20.647 --> 16:23.900
-Take a load off your tootsies.
-Oof!

16:23.983 --> 16:26.236
Thanks... Goofy.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.071
[shuddering with disgust]

16:30.990 --> 16:32.200
[snoring]

16:37.205 --> 16:39.040
[sniffing and moaning]

16:39.124 --> 16:40.583
Oh, smells awful good...

16:40.667 --> 16:43.169
[sniffs] But I got to watch my figurine.

16:43.253 --> 16:48.008
Oh, but my dad never
worries about his figurine.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.135
Hmm, guess you got a point.

16:50.218 --> 16:53.805
If'n I'm Pete,
I must have Pete's appetite.

16:53.888 --> 16:57.726
What say we, uh, start a tab for you?

16:57.809 --> 17:01.896
[TV announcer] And he's on the 20,
the 15, the 40.

17:01.980 --> 17:06.568
Now he's at the five and ten.
The defense is closing in and...

17:06.651 --> 17:08.945
-Oh, the humanity!
-[whistle blows]

17:09.029 --> 17:12.198
Tubby tummy, what's gnawing you?
You're not eating.

17:12.282 --> 17:15.118
Oh, how can I eat when
I know he is in there

17:15.201 --> 17:17.871
slamming his eyeballs all
over my TV with his eyes?

17:17.954 --> 17:23.418
[Goofy] Oh, Peg-head!
[Chuckles] Got any more of them sody pops?

17:23.501 --> 17:26.338
Just a minute... Pete.

17:26.421 --> 17:28.840
[snarling]

17:28.923 --> 17:34.721
If anybody needs me,
I'll be next door, meditating.

17:34.804 --> 17:38.099
Hey, feed the cat, will you, Goofball?

17:38.183 --> 17:40.018
[Peter growling]

17:47.484 --> 17:51.738
[Panting] OK now, Petey boy,
easy does it.

17:51.863 --> 17:56.576
No hyperventilizing.
Two more days, and it'll all be over.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.453
[meows]

17:58.536 --> 18:02.749
Oh! Well, you want your
supper, do you, kitty?

18:02.832 --> 18:04.459
[screeching]

18:04.542 --> 18:07.962
I let him take my name and sit in my chair

18:08.046 --> 18:11.758
and chow down on my food.

18:11.841 --> 18:17.430
Oh, I even let him call me
the [stutters] "G" name.

18:17.514 --> 18:21.393
And you don't even wanna
know how I feel about that.

18:21.518 --> 18:24.562
-[yowling]
-Hey, come back here!

18:25.188 --> 18:27.524
Open up! Let me out!

18:30.276 --> 18:32.278
Uh-oh.

18:35.323 --> 18:39.536
Somebody get me out of here!

18:42.372 --> 18:45.542
[Goofy] That's mighty fine cooking
there, lint ball.

18:45.625 --> 18:49.087
Oh, why, thank you... [stutters] Pete.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.089
I hope he recovers soon.

18:51.172 --> 18:54.759
One Pete was one thing,
but two is just too much.

18:54.843 --> 18:57.012
Yeah, but this one gives
a better allowance.

18:57.095 --> 19:02.100
[burping] Got any more of them
marmalade and wheat-germ pancakes?

19:03.768 --> 19:05.687

there's got to be some way

And it's mine! It's mine! All mine!

19:36.634 --> 19:40.764
All I need is a... can opener.

19:40.847 --> 19:47.812
And I got no can opener!
[wailing]

19:47.937 --> 19:50.690
Open! Please, please, please, please open.

19:50.774 --> 19:52.776
Please! Ow! [gurgling]

19:57.155 --> 19:59.532
[gurgling] Help!

20:03.244 --> 20:05.330
Where are you two going with all that?

20:05.413 --> 20:09.084
Well, we're taking them out to Mr G...
uh, I mean, Dad.

Uh... who are you?
And what are you talking about?

20:33.274 --> 20:37.487
Pete, there's somebody here from...
ahhh!

-Pete.
-Goofy!

-What happened to you?
-What happened to him?

20:45.036 --> 20:49.124
-What happened to us?
-What's gonna happen to me?

20:49.207 --> 20:51.209
What have you done to yourself?

20:51.793 --> 20:55.255
-Me?
-The deal's off, Pete!

Oh! Wait! Oh, Mr. Weight-loss man, wait!

21:13.940 --> 21:17.652
Uh... there's been a slight
misunderstanding, you see. I'm Pete.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.613
No, Goofy, I'm Pete. Remember?

21:20.739 --> 21:25.035
-He's not Pete, he's Goofy!
-I'm not Goofy, you're Goofy.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.911
You're both Goofy.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.538
Then who's she?

You got to believe me! I'm me, honest!

If you're really Goofy,
then what am I thinking?

21:35.628 --> 21:37.464
What!

21:37.547 --> 21:40.717
I'm too smart for a couple
of scam artists like you two.
