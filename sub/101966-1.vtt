WEBVTT

00:19.881 --> 00:22.194
[wind blowing]

00:31.928 --> 00:35.104
What if we could create...

00:36.105 --> 00:39.108
the ideal society...

00:40.971 --> 00:43.802
the perfect nation...

00:47.116 --> 00:49.566
in our backyard?

00:51.223 --> 00:55.814
â™ª garage rock

01:04.478 --> 01:08.240
Without the resources to fund
our nation,

01:08.275 --> 01:13.107
that question lingered for ten
long years

01:13.142 --> 01:15.558
until 1998.

01:15.592 --> 01:19.251
When the Republic of Kallipoly
was born.

01:19.286 --> 01:23.945
[high pitch voice]
What happened in 1998, Mr.
Wilson?

01:23.980 --> 01:27.949
Well, it began with a tragedy,
as most great things do

01:27.984 --> 01:31.160
with the death of our inlaws.

01:40.272 --> 01:42.930
It began with uh...

01:42.964 --> 01:45.415
a tragedy, as most great
things do,

01:45.450 --> 01:49.626
with the death of a
dear relative, who left
us a ranch.

01:49.661 --> 01:54.114
I set to work on a
constitution.

01:54.148 --> 01:58.463
And within a year, we had our
nation.

01:59.464 --> 02:01.121
[intercom beep]

02:01.155 --> 02:04.469
Grant, it's Raymond.

02:05.539 --> 02:07.334
You alone?

02:07.368 --> 02:09.129
Yeah.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.131
[gate buzzing open]

02:11.165 --> 02:14.686
[harmonica playing]

02:20.174 --> 02:23.315
[bell ringing]

02:51.757 --> 02:53.207
Grant.

02:53.242 --> 02:55.692
Morning, Raymond.

02:57.211 --> 03:00.352
Welcome to Kallipoly.

03:05.254 --> 03:07.670
Can I fix you a coffee?
No, this won't take long.

03:07.704 --> 03:11.363
Good. I got a real busy day.
Course you do.

03:15.367 --> 03:19.095
You see we started redoing
the backyard, putting in a
new pool and everything.

03:19.129 --> 03:21.097
I did see that.
You run it by the fascists?

03:21.131 --> 03:24.342
- Yeah, I went by the
county office.
- Oh, they
have no authority.

03:24.376 --> 03:28.104
They pulled up the survey. It
seems that your fence is ten
feet into my property.

03:28.138 --> 03:30.727
Those surveys are out of date.
They don't include treaties
made

03:30.762 --> 03:34.352
by me and the previous owner.
- These treaties written down
anywhere?

03:34.386 --> 03:38.701
They were gentlemen's
agreements
between me and Mr. McGregor.

03:38.735 --> 03:41.117
So there's no proof?

03:41.151 --> 03:43.637
How's my word?

03:53.957 --> 03:58.099
Listen man, I really hate to dothis, but but we're squeezing
in this rock waterfall

03:58.134 --> 04:01.241
and that pump system needs
more space than a golf course.

04:01.275 --> 04:04.623
- We could really use this land.
- You delcaring war?

04:04.658 --> 04:07.799
I'm coming to you as a
neighbor, trying to work this
out peacefully, so we

04:07.833 --> 04:10.457
don't need to get the court
involved.
- Whose court?

04:10.491 --> 04:13.149
The Republic of Kallipoly
is a sovereign nation.

04:13.183 --> 04:18.154
You're an American, same as me
man, no matter what flag you put
out front.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.018
Listen.

04:20.052 --> 04:24.125
Don't be coming to my property,my nation, and telling me what
I am and what I ain't.

04:24.160 --> 04:29.407
Easy, Grant. I'm just saying,
legally, you're a citizen. I
wanna fix this

04:29.441 --> 04:31.650
in a neighborly way.
- Neighborly way, is that it?

04:31.685 --> 04:36.586
All right, I'll tell you
what, neighbor. You want my
land, you want my property?

04:36.621 --> 04:38.347
You're gonna have to take it.

04:38.381 --> 04:43.144
- This isn't one of your war
games, Grant.
- I'll take you to court if I
have to.

04:44.214 --> 04:45.699
All right. Raymond,

04:45.733 --> 04:50.151
you just stepped into a cow pieyou ain't never getting out
your rug.

04:50.359 --> 04:52.119
What's that even mean, man?

04:52.153 --> 04:55.433
Get ready for war.
Cuz you're gonna get it.

04:55.467 --> 04:58.332
You'll hear from my lawyer.

05:00.161 --> 05:03.510
You'll hear from my .45.

05:06.478 --> 05:09.688
Savannah! Savannah!

05:09.723 --> 05:13.899
- I'm busy.
- In my office now.

05:16.488 --> 05:19.008
- Yes, Daddy?
- Did you take my pen?

05:19.042 --> 05:22.183
- Which one?
- My signature pen.

05:23.046 --> 05:25.980
Do not touch my personal
property unless I give you
explicit permission.

05:26.015 --> 05:29.052
- You're supposed to play with
toys.
- That is a replica model. Do
you know

05:29.087 --> 05:33.540
how many hours it took me to
build that?
- That's not some toy you find
at a store.

05:33.574 --> 05:36.922
You got it on Amazon?
No, I...

05:38.027 --> 05:40.857
Where's my pen?
This one?

05:40.892 --> 05:44.378
Damn it, Savannah, this is my
signature pen. I wrote our
constitution

05:44.413 --> 05:47.174
with this pen.
This is part of our history.

05:47.208 --> 05:49.901
It's a rollerball.
With elvish on the side.

05:49.935 --> 05:53.353
That's Latin. Do you know what
it says?

05:54.595 --> 05:58.668
'Aut vincere, aut mori.'

05:58.703 --> 06:02.845
Conquer or die, our national
motto.

06:02.879 --> 06:05.019
Well, mine is 'live out loud.'

06:05.054 --> 06:07.090
This isn't a joke.
Are you sure?

06:07.125 --> 06:10.093
Do you have any respect
for the Republic of Kallipoly?

06:10.128 --> 06:12.924
Why would I?
All it does is kill my social
life.

06:12.958 --> 06:16.410
Well, maybe if your deadbeat
friends
can't respect our nation

06:16.445 --> 06:20.518
they shouldn't be your
friends.
- Well, that kinda rules out
everyone.

06:20.552 --> 06:23.106
Except a few gun nuts, and
total weirdos.

06:23.141 --> 06:26.420
What about that Henderson boy?
Bobby Henderson?

06:26.455 --> 06:29.699
He got expelled for
bringing a knife to school.

06:29.734 --> 06:32.530
I'm sure he had a reason.
Yeah, he was angry and

06:32.564 --> 06:34.428
desperate for attention.

06:34.463 --> 06:36.396
Sounds familiar.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.708
Okay. One more word

06:38.743 --> 06:41.228
and you can say goodbye to
summer classes.

06:41.262 --> 06:45.543
You don't need a community
college
hack to be a photographer.

06:45.577 --> 06:48.615
He isn't
Two words, that's it. Goodbye
school.

06:48.649 --> 06:51.411
I wasn't disrespecting you.
No, you contradicted me.

06:51.445 --> 06:55.242
- That's disrespect, plain and
simple.
- So no one can disagree with
you,

06:55.276 --> 06:56.726
about anything?
Watch it.

06:56.761 --> 07:01.110
Or what? You'll burn my
books? You will respect me
and your country.

07:01.144 --> 07:04.458
All right, instead of taking
photographs
of ash trays and fruit bowls

07:04.493 --> 07:07.116
you'll spend the summer with
me and your brother.

07:07.150 --> 07:09.429
I'm not doing your stupid
exercises.

07:09.463 --> 07:14.088
No, you'll film them.
We need a new recruitment
video.

07:14.123 --> 07:17.091
You can't make me do this.

07:17.126 --> 07:19.508
Watch me.

07:21.475 --> 07:24.133
Mom.

07:28.965 --> 07:34.488
Dear Lord, thank you for all
the
blessings you have given us.

07:35.144 --> 07:40.114
And please,
let them be enough.

07:40.149 --> 07:42.703
[knocks on door]

07:44.325 --> 07:48.882
â™ª garage rock

07:59.893 --> 08:04.035
Next thing I know, Tammy
Gonzalez
herself is down at my ranch.

08:04.069 --> 08:08.833
Telling me where my cattle can
go,
what kind of feed to give 'em,

08:08.867 --> 08:10.144
how I can use my land.

08:10.179 --> 08:12.146
See now, that ain't none of
her business.

08:12.181 --> 08:15.805
That's exactly her business.
Regulate the hell out of us so

08:15.840 --> 08:18.808
some suit can come and buy us
out.

08:18.843 --> 08:21.362
Yeah, but I mean, she's
supposed to
be working for us, right?

08:21.397 --> 08:24.987
We voted her in didn't we?
Oh, no, not me, no.

08:25.021 --> 08:28.646
Last time I voted was for
Reagan.
Jeez.

08:28.680 --> 08:31.890
She did you wrong.
But they all do. Ya know,

08:31.925 --> 08:36.170
it's not just one man, one
woman
It's the whole damn system.

08:36.205 --> 08:39.864
This country used to be a
place where, you know...

08:40.554 --> 08:41.831
you could build a life.

08:41.866 --> 08:46.353
Buy a property, have a family.
Honest day for honest pay.

08:46.387 --> 08:51.220
Now they got us so tied up in
layoffs and loans and
regulations,

08:51.254 --> 08:55.465
lucky you could even see
straight,
much less build a life.

08:58.123 --> 09:00.091
You like being free, don't
you, Jim?

09:00.125 --> 09:02.921
I do.
How long you been herding
cattle?

09:02.956 --> 09:05.855
36 years.
You think some city slicker
with

09:05.890 --> 09:09.583
new boots knows more about
raising cattle than you?

09:09.618 --> 09:12.552
No.
Course not.

09:13.138 --> 09:15.209
Ya know...

09:15.244 --> 09:19.697
A man's got a choice. He can
either take the hand he's dealt

09:19.731 --> 09:23.217
and hope the dealer doesn't
have an ace up his sleeve.

09:23.252 --> 09:28.084
Or, he can leave. Start his
own game.

09:28.119 --> 09:31.881
That's not a real choice.
What you're doing

09:31.916 --> 09:36.472
What I'm doing is making
myself a goddamn life.

09:37.162 --> 09:43.099
You ever wanna see what real
freedom looks like, Jim? You
come on by.

09:43.134 --> 09:45.585
Hey. Put his drinks on me.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.034
No, you don't need to do that.

09:47.069 --> 09:51.591
Call it diplomacy, ya know.
Keeping things friendly at the
border.

09:52.143 --> 09:55.422
Now Grant, I already told you
twice.

09:55.456 --> 09:59.426
That's legal tender. That's
recognized by 13 nations around

09:59.460 --> 10:03.257
the world and two online
markets.
Yeah, well we take cash.

10:03.292 --> 10:04.604
That is cash.
American.

10:04.638 --> 10:10.092
Tell you what. I'm going to
give you a good exchange
rate.

10:10.126 --> 10:15.304
Five Nortons to the dollar.
Usually it's three to one.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.755
I'll tell you what.

10:17.789 --> 10:23.105
Now you come back with
some real money, or I'm
going to call the Sheriff.

10:23.139 --> 10:24.554
How's that sound?

10:24.589 --> 10:28.110
You ready to start an
international
incident over two whiskeys?

10:28.144 --> 10:29.732
Wait a minute.
I'm thinking about it.

10:29.767 --> 10:33.943
Hey wait a minute, wait a
minute. I'll cover it. I'll
pay for his whiskey.

10:33.978 --> 10:36.774
No need.
Keeping it...

10:36.808 --> 10:42.503
keeping it friendly, right?

10:46.887 --> 10:48.578
Right.

10:56.172 --> 11:00.004
Come on by any time you want,
Jim.

11:03.041 --> 11:07.356
â™ª warm organ

11:17.193 --> 11:19.161
It's still too low.

11:19.195 --> 11:22.198
Why don't we just go inside?
You know,
I wrote this as a desk piece.

11:22.233 --> 11:26.824
No, we want the natural
light. It opens it up. Your
office looks too serious.

11:26.858 --> 11:30.586
It is serious.
It's the state of the union.

11:32.864 --> 11:37.110
Okay I'm ready. Just do
whatever you're gonna do.

11:41.079 --> 11:43.703
Action?
Action.

11:45.118 --> 11:49.191
Dear friends, countrymen, and
enemies.
I'm Admiral Grant T. Wilson

11:49.225 --> 11:51.711
the Supreme Leader of Kallipoly.- What are you doing with your
hands?

11:51.745 --> 11:55.197
I'm illustrating my point.
I'm trying to connect with the
audience.

11:55.231 --> 11:57.061
That's not how it reads.

11:57.095 --> 11:59.649
How about, like, that?

11:59.926 --> 12:06.070
The fat cat fascists in
Washington are betraying
their own people.

12:06.104 --> 12:11.075
They refuse to recognize the
nation of Kallipoly.

12:11.109 --> 12:14.768
Their, their, their line?
'Tyranny.'

12:14.803 --> 12:16.045
Tyranny.
Didn't you write this?

12:16.080 --> 12:18.565
Yes, I wrote it, but
I wrote it as a desk piece.

12:18.599 --> 12:22.086
It's like four sentences.
I know, I know, I wrote it.

12:24.088 --> 12:27.781
If you value your heritage,
your freedom, you will make
a stand.

12:27.816 --> 12:29.576
Kyle you're moving.
I need a break.

12:29.610 --> 12:31.060
No, you don't.
My arms are tired.

12:31.095 --> 12:34.098
Shut up and hold it straight.
We're almost done.

12:37.101 --> 12:39.482
Don't breathe.

12:39.517 --> 12:42.071
Line?
Fat cat.

12:42.106 --> 12:43.590
Fat cat no, I said that.

12:43.624 --> 12:48.698
Join us today
in the nation of Kallipoly

12:49.009 --> 12:51.184
for a...

12:53.634 --> 12:57.086
ah, fuck...brighter?

12:57.121 --> 13:00.020
Fuck it, let's just go inside.

13:04.128 --> 13:08.511
â™ª humming organ

13:10.134 --> 13:12.826
It's only ten feet.
I know, I told him.

13:12.861 --> 13:15.795
And did you hear them today?
Shouting and firing off rifles

13:15.829 --> 13:18.798
at who knows what?
It's wild country.

13:18.832 --> 13:22.111
Quit talking like Clint
Eastwood.
You're from New York.

13:22.146 --> 13:23.595
They're a different breed out
here.

13:23.630 --> 13:25.805
People that didn't like the
rules of
city life, so they went where

13:25.839 --> 13:28.186
they wouldn't be bothered.
They're bothering me.

13:28.221 --> 13:34.227
It's okay, V. That nut next
door,
he's nothing to worry about.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.989
What about the son?

13:38.024 --> 13:40.336
What about him?

13:48.172 --> 13:51.485
Babe, come on. The dishes can
wait.
Kyle isn't back.

13:51.520 --> 13:55.835
Well, if you roll and you know
attack say, uh...

13:56.180 --> 13:58.044
Venezuela,

13:58.078 --> 13:59.183
I'll roll for him.

13:59.217 --> 14:02.496
Or she can attack Europe
and you roll for yourself.

14:02.531 --> 14:05.085
She can make up her own mind.

14:05.914 --> 14:08.054
Any news from the border?
All clear.

14:08.088 --> 14:10.539
Thank goodness.

14:15.924 --> 14:18.064
I'll end my turn.
Smart.

14:18.098 --> 14:21.067
Time to take over the world.
How? We got you surrounded.

14:21.101 --> 14:23.069
For now.
Why don't you stop being
stubborn

14:23.103 --> 14:25.071
and accept what's coming
and run away like you always
do.

14:25.105 --> 14:27.038
Grant.
I'm just fooling around with
her.

14:27.073 --> 14:29.523
Well, I'd be fine if you two
stopped picking on me.

14:29.558 --> 14:31.525
Hey, there's no rules against
alliances.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.355
Mom, do you want to start an
alliance?

14:33.389 --> 14:36.358
I don't know, honey.
Come on, we have Europe
surrounded.

14:36.392 --> 14:39.016
If you hit Iceland and head
south, then I can come
through Ukraine

14:39.050 --> 14:43.020
and we'll take down the
Eastern Bloc.
Hey, no table talk.

14:43.054 --> 14:45.194
Is there a rule against it?

14:45.229 --> 14:49.026
We don't have that psycho
psychic
connection like you and Kyle.

14:49.060 --> 14:50.061
We have to use words.

14:50.096 --> 14:53.099
I don't see anything about
talking.

14:53.133 --> 14:56.274
Conspire all you like,
it won't do you a lick of good.

14:56.309 --> 14:58.449
We will.

14:58.483 --> 14:59.553
Well?

14:59.588 --> 15:01.797
You gonna quit stalling
and play the damn game?

15:01.831 --> 15:04.041
Mom? Are you with me?

15:04.075 --> 15:04.938
Yup.

15:04.973 --> 15:07.389
This is mutiny.
How? We're enemies.

15:07.423 --> 15:11.048
It's rebellion.
Ukraine...

15:11.082 --> 15:13.050
defend yourself.
Savannah,

15:13.084 --> 15:15.397
this is your last chance.
You can't come back from this.

15:15.431 --> 15:18.779
You attacked me. I'm defending
myself.

15:19.159 --> 15:21.575
Bullshit.
Language.

15:21.610 --> 15:26.235
- Two down, three to go.
- Whoa, I got that myself...

15:26.270 --> 15:28.134
Maybe it's time for a break.
Dessert anyone?

15:28.168 --> 15:31.654
- After we take Europe.
- You guys are just a horde of
Commies.

15:31.689 --> 15:33.070
We defeated you once, we'll
get you again.

15:33.104 --> 15:35.313
- What does that make you, the
Nazis?
- You know, Australia's

15:35.348 --> 15:39.973
not that well defended.
- Ukraine, defend yourself.

15:42.286 --> 15:45.875
You're gonna have to do better
than that.

15:46.531 --> 15:49.086
- Jesus fucking Christ.
G- rant, do not take

15:49.120 --> 15:52.503
the Lord's name in vain.
- I'm sorry, it just came out.

15:52.537 --> 15:55.023
Only one left.

15:55.471 --> 15:57.094
Ah, careful.

15:57.128 --> 15:59.786
Properly, roll em, no spin, on
the table.

15:59.820 --> 16:02.306
Hey, I'm not doing anything.

16:04.135 --> 16:06.482
I must be lucky.

16:08.036 --> 16:10.452
Are you serious? It was one
country?

16:10.486 --> 16:14.525
If you don't respect the rules,
we won't play.

16:15.871 --> 16:18.184
Who wants pie?

16:29.747 --> 16:32.060
[engine starts]

16:42.173 --> 16:46.902
â™ª lonesome guitar

18:49.162 --> 18:51.854
Think that's deep enough?

18:54.478 --> 18:57.032
You know, it's getting awfully
hot out here, Molly.

18:57.066 --> 19:01.036
Why don't you go inside and
catch a breeze?

19:01.070 --> 19:04.004
I found a nice breeze.

19:05.420 --> 19:09.803
Hey, why don't you grab me
a cold one, you know, boost
company morale.

19:09.838 --> 19:14.877
Drinking on the job. What wouldthe Better Business Bureau say
about that?

19:14.912 --> 19:16.603
Those sons of bitches don't
know anything.

19:16.638 --> 19:22.333
She knows all about the bureau,son. Just, ya know, keep
working on the ditch there.

19:25.854 --> 19:29.823
Is that why you hired me?
To get drunk and talk shit?

19:29.858 --> 19:32.861
It wasn't the testimonials.

19:33.206 --> 19:36.036
Right now, you got two options.

19:36.071 --> 19:38.038
Is that any way to talk to
your boss?

19:38.073 --> 19:42.526
You can shut your yap and let
us finish. Or you can give us
half day's pay

19:42.560 --> 19:45.080
and we'll go home.

19:47.082 --> 19:50.534
[bell ringing]

19:55.401 --> 20:01.027
If you're waiting for an encore,
I'm afraid you're out of luck.

20:01.061 --> 20:05.065
Oh, I'm just enjoying the
quiet.

20:06.377 --> 20:10.347
Certainly was a spirited Bible
study today.

20:10.381 --> 20:14.040
- I'm sorry if I spoke too
freely.
- Nothing to apologize for.

20:14.074 --> 20:20.288
Sometimes I wish we had
more searchers, less believers.

20:24.809 --> 20:31.368
You know, you haven't missed
a sermon in five months.

20:31.402 --> 20:34.578
They've been a real comfort.
Set up for Sunday school,

20:34.612 --> 20:37.926
lead the potluck.
- I want to serve, any way I
can.

20:37.960 --> 20:44.243
And I thank you for it, I do.
You've given so much love to
this community.

20:44.760 --> 20:46.935
But?

20:47.107 --> 20:48.557
But...

20:48.592 --> 20:53.942
I wonder if, well, more of that
love might be needed at home.

20:55.944 --> 20:58.912
- Pastor.
- It's just, we haven't seen
Grant or Kyle

20:58.947 --> 21:01.260
since Christmas, and word gets
around.

21:01.294 --> 21:04.297
It's hard to get them in,
except for the holidays.

21:04.332 --> 21:05.850
Then I'll come to them.

21:05.885 --> 21:10.269
I'd be happy to drop by,
any time you'd like,
provide any guidance I can.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.995
Thank you, Pastor, I...

21:14.963 --> 21:17.206
Bless you.

21:28.873 --> 21:31.324
â™ª dusty folk
I bet they're listening right
now,

21:31.359 --> 21:32.739
through that phone of yours.

21:32.774 --> 21:37.123
Reading all your emails,
tracking
every video you ever watched.

21:37.157 --> 21:40.816
They're not for the people, by
the people.
They're against them.

21:40.851 --> 21:46.615
Yeah, they scare you to the
polls, right?
And they,

21:46.650 --> 21:48.790
they fucking, uh...

21:48.824 --> 21:55.141
put you in debt, and then they
line you up for the shakedown
and then the slaughter.

21:55.175 --> 22:00.146
Yeah, and that's just you,
in this country. You
American people. The rest of
us

22:00.180 --> 22:04.184
in the world? We got it worse.
Vietnam, Iraq, Cuba.

22:04.219 --> 22:09.155
God, you boys, you just
can't stop meddling. You
talk democracy, free
markets

22:09.189 --> 22:13.090
meanwhile, you make sure
no one else has a say.

22:13.435 --> 22:17.405
The founding fathers, man,
right.

22:18.198 --> 22:20.200
That shit rolls downhill.

22:20.235 --> 22:23.342
They were bullied, they were
run right out of town, right.

22:23.376 --> 22:27.863
Bullied completely.
They had a chance to break the
cycle.

22:27.898 --> 22:31.660
But no, they turned bully too.

22:31.695 --> 22:34.353
What's the count, Rick?

22:35.215 --> 22:38.840
The way you're going, I'd
guess you
were four, maybe five deep?

22:38.874 --> 22:42.395
That ain't the bourbon, talking.That's righteous indignation
right there.

22:42.430 --> 22:45.018
Yeah, well, three puts
you over the legal limit.

22:45.053 --> 22:48.090
Look like I'm driving?
That's your truck out front,
isn't it?

22:48.125 --> 22:53.958
Yeah, with my boy in it,
waiting to drive me home.
Anything else, Sheriff?

22:57.548 --> 23:02.691
Ain't you got anything better todo than harass foreign
dignitaries?

23:02.726 --> 23:06.143
I'll let you know when I see
one.

23:07.972 --> 23:13.253
Hey, why don't you quit all
this
them and us talk.

23:13.599 --> 23:16.118
Where were you born?

23:16.153 --> 23:19.398
Hell, where are you right now?

23:20.260 --> 23:23.712
Tell you the truth, I don't
know.

23:23.747 --> 23:29.131
It's supposed to be the land
of the free, but it sure don't
seem that way.

23:29.925 --> 23:31.582
Keep it up, Grant.

23:31.617 --> 23:34.413
I'm waiting for a reason.

23:34.447 --> 23:40.004
That's it, man.
Scare the innocent, protect
the powerful.

23:40.626 --> 23:44.630
Don't you get tired of this
bullshit?

23:44.664 --> 23:47.115
Pretending to be someone
special,

23:47.149 --> 23:51.360
when you're really just
a sad, sad nobody.

23:54.122 --> 23:58.126
Ain't you got another black
boy to shoot?

24:12.174 --> 24:14.798
You're driving.

24:27.811 --> 24:33.161
[singing]
Let it shine, let it shine,
let it shine.

24:33.817 --> 24:36.992
[humming]

24:40.340 --> 24:42.308
It's me.
Don't...

24:42.342 --> 24:43.792
sneak up on me like that.

24:43.827 --> 24:47.693
Sorry, babe.
I can't turn off the training.

24:49.039 --> 24:52.629
- Hey, I thought we were havingribs.
- We are. Braised short ribs

24:52.663 --> 24:55.528
in a red wine reduction.
- Short ribs?

24:55.563 --> 24:57.496
The goofy things the Koreans
eat?

24:57.530 --> 25:00.153
- This is from a Bobby Flay
cookbook.
- You like him.

25:00.188 --> 25:03.053
- I like anything you're
cooking, babe.
- Go on, take a seat

25:03.087 --> 25:05.676
and stop eating the salad.

25:24.212 --> 25:26.525
Ah, there it is.

25:26.559 --> 25:31.668
- How'd it go at the
Patterson's?
- We put down some pipe and
she paid.

25:31.702 --> 25:33.359
Did you ask about their deck?

25:33.393 --> 25:37.087
We got enough online sales,
I don't need to be begging for
loose work.

25:37.121 --> 25:41.401
I know, but most of the
handyman jobs
get done over the summer.

25:41.436 --> 25:43.680
Candice, we'll be fine.

25:43.714 --> 25:46.441
Where's Kyle now?
Studying for the SATs, I hope.

25:46.475 --> 25:50.031
He's in the combat simulator.
He can't play video games

25:50.065 --> 25:51.411
until he studies.
That's no game.

25:51.446 --> 25:55.105
That's the closest he'll
come to real combat until he
enlists or

25:55.139 --> 25:57.038
a Muslim opens fire at an
Albertson's.

25:57.072 --> 26:02.595
Grant, the SATs are
important. Especially when
he only has a home school
diploma.

26:02.630 --> 26:05.874
Only? Hell, he's learned more
here than whatever the hell
they're teaching down the road.

26:05.909 --> 26:10.707
And real stuff that he can use,not just empty facts he'll
forget in a year.

26:10.741 --> 26:13.054
Colleges have to compare him
with other students.

26:13.088 --> 26:14.918
That's the whole point
of a standardized test.

26:14.952 --> 26:17.955
No, the whole point is to
shovel more money into the
ivory tower.

26:17.990 --> 26:21.303
Maybe, but college is still
a wonderful opportunity.

26:21.338 --> 26:22.891
I'm not going to college.

26:22.926 --> 26:27.137
- Y'all need to stop
sneaking around.
- Can't help it, it's in our
blood.

26:29.001 --> 26:32.107
- Dinner will be ready in 20
minutes.
- I'm hungry now.

26:32.142 --> 26:35.317
- Patience is a virtue.
- And confidence is king.

26:35.352 --> 26:38.286
The boy knows what he wants
and he takes it.

26:38.320 --> 26:40.806
Kyle, you should at least
apply, in case you change your
mind.

26:40.840 --> 26:44.499
You know, if the whole world
changes he can go to the
community quack house.

26:44.533 --> 26:48.089
That's not the same as leaving
and having a real college
experience.

26:48.123 --> 26:50.643
Oh, what? Smoking a doobie on a
beanbag? Growing a beard and

26:50.678 --> 26:53.612
protesting the meal plan?
It's more than that, it's

26:53.646 --> 26:56.960
making new friends, trying new
things, finding yourself.

26:56.994 --> 26:59.652
- Well, that sounds dangerous.
- College is for pussies.

26:59.687 --> 27:02.103
Hey, you know your Mom
doesn't like that word.

27:02.137 --> 27:05.106
- Sorry, sir.
- Think of all the fun you
could have.

27:05.140 --> 27:08.109
The things you'd learn,
the people you'd meet.

27:08.143 --> 27:09.628
- I learn everything I need
here.
- See?

27:09.662 --> 27:13.942
- On my computer.
- Don't you want to go
somewhere new?

27:13.977 --> 27:17.463
If I go anywhere, I'm joining
the Marines.

27:17.497 --> 27:21.847
Please just think about it,
okay? For me.

27:21.881 --> 27:26.161
Don't worry about it, babe.
The boy'll be fine.

27:27.335 --> 27:29.820
[wind blowing]

27:38.173 --> 27:40.589
Savannah.

27:47.527 --> 27:50.013
Savannah.

27:55.846 --> 27:58.193
Savannah!

28:10.723 --> 28:15.176
Jesus Christ. What the hell
are you doing pointing a
loaded weapon at me?

28:15.210 --> 28:17.178
It's a squirt gun.

28:17.212 --> 28:21.182
What if I'd mistaken you for
a burglar and shot you?

28:21.216 --> 28:22.701
I had to show you I'm ready.

28:22.735 --> 28:26.946
Send me out there, Admiral.
I'm the best scout you got.

28:27.464 --> 28:31.192
All right, let's see how ready
you are.

28:31.226 --> 28:34.057
Give me that rucksack.

28:38.130 --> 28:40.615
Night vision goggles.

28:40.926 --> 28:43.135
Rope.

28:46.241 --> 28:48.554
Tactical knife. Serrated edge?

28:48.588 --> 28:50.211
Yes, sir.

28:50.245 --> 28:52.558
Compass.

28:52.592 --> 28:55.078
Zip ties.

28:56.113 --> 28:58.909
What's this?

29:00.255 --> 29:04.397
A real gun?
Why would you need a real gun?

29:04.432 --> 29:06.641
A coyote comes at me in the
brush.

29:06.675 --> 29:08.091
Raymond spots me, grabs a
rifle.

29:08.125 --> 29:11.611
Sheriff drives by, mistakes me
for a burglar and opens fire.

29:11.646 --> 29:16.237
This is a stealth operation.
You fire this thing off, your
cover's blown to hell.

29:16.271 --> 29:17.652
What if it gets rough?

29:17.686 --> 29:19.792
Bring a taser.
Sir.

29:19.827 --> 29:22.277
I'm not going out there naked.
I need a gun.

29:22.312 --> 29:25.798
Absolutely not.
An airsoft gun?

29:25.833 --> 29:27.075
They're silent.

29:27.110 --> 29:29.940
Fine, a small one.

29:32.115 --> 29:35.187
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:38.984 --> 29:42.332
What is this?
Tranquilizers.

29:43.471 --> 29:45.956
All right.

29:47.682 --> 29:51.824
Secure that gun. Stow it away.
Okay?

29:53.136 --> 29:56.104
Engage only if fired upon.

29:56.139 --> 29:59.936
Observe and report. Got it?

29:59.970 --> 30:02.179
Yes, sir.

30:05.562 --> 30:08.807
See what kind of progress
they're making on this pump
system

30:08.841 --> 30:10.705
and what we'd need to take out.

30:10.739 --> 30:12.638
Hypothetically.

30:12.672 --> 30:14.951
While I'm in there
No.

30:14.985 --> 30:17.125
This is a recon mission.

30:17.160 --> 30:19.127
Sir, all due respect.

30:19.162 --> 30:20.508
That's not a good start.

30:20.542 --> 30:21.958
What's the point of this
mission?

30:21.992 --> 30:24.512
We know the make and the model,
so I have the specs.

30:24.546 --> 30:26.341
How?
Everything's online.

30:26.376 --> 30:30.000
No, how do you know
the make and the model?

30:30.035 --> 30:33.141
Found the installation order
in their trash.

30:33.176 --> 30:35.212
You go through the neighbors'
trash often?

30:35.247 --> 30:37.732
Only when it's important.

30:37.766 --> 30:41.840
Good work, soldier.
We need your vigilance.

30:44.187 --> 30:46.775
Now more than ever.

30:52.712 --> 30:55.094
Dismissed.

30:58.787 --> 31:01.583
Jesus Christ.

31:37.965 --> 31:42.417
â™ª country rock

31:44.764 --> 31:48.044
Another point for San
Francisco:
the nightlife.

31:48.078 --> 31:51.081
You said you wanted to settle
down some place nice and
quiet

31:51.116 --> 31:54.567
with plenty of land. Well, we
got it.

31:54.602 --> 31:56.742
I think there was a reason
this was on the market.

31:56.776 --> 31:59.089
Come on, it's nice here.
Just takes some getting used
to.

31:59.124 --> 32:01.091
Are you used to someone
poking through your trash and

32:01.126 --> 32:03.266
wandering around your backyard?
- Vanessa,

32:03.300 --> 32:07.995
we lived in San Francisco.
Okay, that was different.

32:09.134 --> 32:11.136
- Call the cops.
- I'm not calling the cops.

32:11.170 --> 32:13.483
- Do you want me to do it?
- He's a kid.

32:13.517 --> 32:17.314
Okay. Tomorrow morning, I'll
head down to the court and
get things going.

32:17.349 --> 32:22.285
Once Grant receives an
official summons,
he'll come to his senses.

32:22.319 --> 32:26.945
â™ª guitar solo

32:47.482 --> 32:49.968
[gun shot]

32:52.660 --> 32:55.145
[more shots]

33:06.501 --> 33:09.021
Oh that sounds wonderful.

33:09.056 --> 33:11.990
No, we tried, we really did.

33:12.024 --> 33:14.130
The summers are really busy
here.

33:14.164 --> 33:19.135
I can't do that, I can't
leave them alone. After the
third night of burnt
barbecue,

33:19.169 --> 33:23.035
the kids will starve,
and you know how Grant gets.

33:23.070 --> 33:25.658
I didn't mean it like that.

33:25.693 --> 33:28.661
He's been better. Really. Good.

33:28.696 --> 33:30.180
[door opens]

33:30.215 --> 33:33.839
I have to go, Carol. Kyle just
walked in.

33:33.873 --> 33:36.428
Sounds good, love you too.

33:37.394 --> 33:39.224
What were you doing out there?

33:39.258 --> 33:42.537
- Target practice.
- No, before that.

33:42.572 --> 33:44.056
Near Raymond's fence.

33:44.091 --> 33:47.680
- That's classified.
- Kyle, I'm your mother.

33:47.715 --> 33:50.407
Sorry. Admiral's orders.

33:50.442 --> 33:53.065
- I'm also the Vice President.
- Yes ma'am.

33:53.100 --> 33:56.172
Constitutionally speaking, I
have a right to all military
intelligence.

33:56.206 --> 34:00.038
In a national emergency
Emergency? What emergency?

34:00.072 --> 34:04.076
That's classified too.
Kyle.

34:04.939 --> 34:10.082
I was measuring land for a
guard tower.
Next to Raymond's fence?

34:12.084 --> 34:13.327
Wait.

34:13.361 --> 34:15.743
Why don't you take twenty
dollars and go into town
tonight?

34:15.777 --> 34:18.090
- Have some fun, maybe see a
movie?
- Hang out with Trevor.

34:18.125 --> 34:21.059
- I haven't seen him around in
a while.
- Trevor's busy.

34:21.093 --> 34:23.544
Oh.
And I don't need to pay for
the movies.

34:23.578 --> 34:28.204
I know, but you might
meet some new people.

34:28.238 --> 34:30.930
Maybe a nice girl.

34:31.414 --> 34:33.278
I can't...

34:33.312 --> 34:37.075
tonight. I gotta go.

35:01.444 --> 35:04.619
[military gibberish]

35:11.143 --> 35:12.938
You need more spin.

35:12.972 --> 35:15.285
I know how to do it.

35:21.636 --> 35:23.604
Maybe skip the color guard
routine.

35:23.638 --> 35:28.298
All right, let's just start
with the dialogue first. Get
behind me, Kyle.

35:31.370 --> 35:34.132
No, get off to the side.

35:34.511 --> 35:37.135
Behind me.
And hold that rifle up

35:37.169 --> 35:38.826
like you mean business.

35:38.860 --> 35:41.139
This is coming off a little
AlQaeda.

35:41.173 --> 35:43.486
Well, they got results, didn't
they?

35:43.520 --> 35:47.006
I guess. Can we start?

35:54.186 --> 35:57.155
You'll be receiving
specialized training

35:57.189 --> 36:01.020
from one of the finest
military minds in the world.

36:04.196 --> 36:08.062
I studied combat history at
Cal State Bakersfield.

36:08.096 --> 36:10.547
I served three years in
the Merchant Marines

36:10.582 --> 36:16.104
And I've devoted my civilian
life to research and field
testing.

36:20.108 --> 36:25.079
Every version, every bit of
specialized training we offer,

36:25.113 --> 36:27.771
from knife throwing

36:29.083 --> 36:31.085
[knife lands]

36:31.119 --> 36:33.605
to scuba diving

36:35.710 --> 36:40.715
will be instructed by me,
Admiral Grant Wilson.

36:42.234 --> 36:45.203
We need you.

36:52.727 --> 36:54.591
You don't have to do
your own freeze frame.

36:54.626 --> 36:56.904
Goddamn it.
Do not interupt a take.

36:56.938 --> 37:00.114
What?
Should I do some pushups?

37:01.115 --> 37:05.637
â™ª gentle guitar

37:20.099 --> 37:22.067
I can't even.

37:22.101 --> 37:25.104
[grunts]
What?

37:30.627 --> 37:33.285
Are those the dailies?
What the hell are you doing?

37:33.320 --> 37:35.908
- Use the door.
- That's not in the
constitution.

37:35.943 --> 37:38.083
- It's common decency.
- Are those the dailies?

37:38.117 --> 37:39.947
- Don't talk like that.
- Isn't that what they're
called?

37:39.981 --> 37:45.090
On a real production. This is
a long shot of you idiots
jerking off in the backyard.

37:45.124 --> 37:47.092
I'd rather be jerking off than
behind the camera.

37:47.126 --> 37:49.267
- That's gross.
- You started it.

37:49.301 --> 37:51.579
And you couldn't do half those
exercises.

37:51.614 --> 37:54.099
Oh yeah, raising
one leg and your rifle
at the same time looks really
tough.

37:54.133 --> 37:57.965
- You wouldn't last a day in
the field.
- Neither would you.

37:59.449 --> 38:02.418
This needs to look cooler.
Can you add some explosions?

38:02.452 --> 38:06.284
Okay, that's stupid and a
waste of time.
I'd like to sleep tonight.

38:06.318 --> 38:08.286
It's important.
For the good of the nation.

38:08.320 --> 38:10.115
Would you shut up about
your stupid nation?

38:10.149 --> 38:13.118
- It's your nation, too.
- I'm an American. Not a
Kallipaloony.

38:13.152 --> 38:17.122
- Kallipaleno.
- This is all just some fantasy
world

38:17.156 --> 38:18.606
that Dad makes us all live in.

38:18.641 --> 38:22.127
If you hate it so much,
why don't you just leave?

38:22.161 --> 38:24.509
I will.

38:29.479 --> 38:31.999
Love you, too.

38:43.493 --> 38:47.359
[counting pushups]

38:50.880 --> 38:55.091
- This is part of your
training.
- Are you saying numbers?

38:57.093 --> 39:00.199
Kyle tells me you're having
trouble with the recruitment
video.

39:00.234 --> 39:02.478
- Sure am.
- What?

39:02.512 --> 39:03.720
Kyle.

39:03.755 --> 39:06.516
Look at me when I'm speaking
to you.

39:09.105 --> 39:10.209
Okay.

39:10.244 --> 39:12.384
This video is very important,
to all of us, okay?

39:12.419 --> 39:18.217
It's the story of the
Republic.
Why we started, where we're
going,

39:18.563 --> 39:21.497
how we've triumphed.
What the future will bring.

39:21.531 --> 39:26.502
And you want me to say all thatwith you two doing pushups in
the dirt?

39:26.536 --> 39:28.055
- And some voiceover.
- That's impossible.

39:28.089 --> 39:31.679
No, nothing's impossible.
That's the magic of movie
making.

39:31.714 --> 39:33.371
That's not how it works.

39:33.405 --> 39:36.684
They have green screens,
and teams of designers,

39:36.719 --> 39:40.067
and footage of interesting
people
doing interesting things.

39:40.101 --> 39:42.207
Right there. Those trees,
behind us.

39:42.241 --> 39:45.728
- That's green, can you use
that?
- Okay, please don't touch
the screen.

39:45.762 --> 39:49.214
You're smudging it. And no, I
can't.

39:49.248 --> 39:50.733
Why not?

39:50.767 --> 39:53.908
Look, we're not asking very
much of you, Savannah. We
just want some

39:53.943 --> 39:57.395
tasteful explosions, maybe
a symbol of the American
threat,

39:57.429 --> 39:58.499
like a...demon eagle.

39:58.534 --> 40:01.226
Zombie Uncle Sam.
That's good. Oh, that's good.

40:01.260 --> 40:04.540
Can you do that?
Sure, that's one of the
presets.

40:04.574 --> 40:05.575
We need a symbol, too.

40:05.610 --> 40:09.130
No, no no no. I'm the symbol.
That's right.

40:09.165 --> 40:11.443
- Can you give me a flaming
sword?
- Me too?

40:11.478 --> 40:13.721
No, that would confuse people.

40:13.756 --> 40:15.723
Okay, look.
I should have the sword.

40:15.758 --> 40:21.591
You're asking for an entire
new movie on top of the basic
stuff we have.

40:22.109 --> 40:26.113
Yeah, so?
It's going to take forever.

40:26.527 --> 40:29.427
Well, then you're wasting time.

41:01.148 --> 41:02.943
Grant.
I'm reading.

41:02.977 --> 41:04.807
- It's important.
- So is this. Did you know

41:04.841 --> 41:08.845
that the US government was
behind
the John Wilkes Booth thing?

41:09.156 --> 41:11.158
Grant, I'm serious.

41:13.194 --> 41:14.989
Go on.

41:15.196 --> 41:17.958
I'm worried about Savannah.

41:17.992 --> 41:19.649
So am I. Is that all?

41:19.684 --> 41:23.170
You're being too hard on her.

41:23.515 --> 41:25.828
Babe.

41:26.173 --> 41:29.487
I'm worried she'll leave again.
This time for good.

41:29.521 --> 41:34.181
Well, then we'll just have to
lock the doors.

41:34.526 --> 41:37.011
What, and forbid her from
leaving the house?

41:37.046 --> 41:39.151
Yup, til she learns some
manners.

41:39.186 --> 41:43.224
Take a year,
less if you let me use force.

41:43.259 --> 41:44.812
She's our daughter, not a
prisoner.

41:44.847 --> 41:48.506
She lives under my roof,
she eats my food, she wears
my clothes, you know.

41:48.540 --> 41:53.683
I made that girl. If I don't
own her,
I got an 18year lease.

41:54.719 --> 41:57.653
We made her.
And she's no one's property.

41:57.687 --> 42:03.244
Well, not according to the
law. I mean, she is for two
more years.

42:04.245 --> 42:07.076
Grant, I'm serious.

42:07.110 --> 42:08.284
I can tell.

42:08.318 --> 42:11.080
But are you almost done?
Cuz I found this amazing theory

42:11.114 --> 42:15.084
about JFK and the teachers
union.

42:16.257 --> 42:17.362
- Grant.
- I'm serious.

42:17.396 --> 42:21.677
Come on, it tracks.
Their damn patsy was arrested

42:21.711 --> 42:24.749
in the book suppository.

42:25.094 --> 42:30.099
Do you know how long I spent
embroidering those pillows?

42:31.134 --> 42:32.584
And?

42:32.619 --> 42:38.210
Hours and hours on each one.
And every day, I set them up
just right

42:38.245 --> 42:42.111
and you waltz in and
throw them off the bed.

42:42.939 --> 42:44.320
Babe.

42:44.354 --> 42:48.082
Just take it easy on Savannah,
okay?
I don't want to lose her.

42:49.774 --> 42:52.570
I'd never let that happen.

42:53.950 --> 42:56.470
You're my queen.

42:57.264 --> 42:58.921
Good.

42:59.611 --> 43:01.924
Well?

43:03.615 --> 43:07.274
- You're my Admiral.
- There it is.

43:30.953 --> 43:35.198
â™ª jazzy rock

44:49.583 --> 44:52.068
That's what I said...

45:30.313 --> 45:33.627
â™ª music fades out

45:35.284 --> 45:39.150
- That's like three days of
sugar.
- Not for me.

45:41.083 --> 45:43.430
Oh, look at this fuck boy.

45:43.464 --> 45:45.052
- Hi, Trevor.
- Hey, fuck boy.

45:45.087 --> 45:47.883
Elsie.
Daddy's got you running
errands now?

45:47.917 --> 45:50.748
- About to blow up a dam or
some bullshit?
- No.

45:50.782 --> 45:52.404
What are you here to do?

45:52.439 --> 45:54.752
You're a real fucking soldier
now, huh?

45:54.786 --> 45:57.064
Better than being
pussywhipped.

45:57.099 --> 45:58.272
Come on, loser's not worth it.

45:58.307 --> 46:01.897
Listen to Elsie.
You do everything else she
says.

46:01.931 --> 46:03.484
Man, you shut the fuck up.

46:03.519 --> 46:06.902
You're some weirdo loser who's
never touched a girl and
probably never will.

46:06.936 --> 46:07.903
Hey.

46:07.937 --> 46:10.491
Unless your freak sister
breaks you off some.

46:10.526 --> 46:13.253
- The fuck?
- Back off, you fucking psycho!

46:13.287 --> 46:15.462
Come on Kyle, let's go.

46:15.496 --> 46:19.190
No, it's not that bad.
No no no baby, it's not that
bad.

46:34.722 --> 46:37.311
That was so stupid.

46:38.140 --> 46:39.313
And kind of sweet.

46:39.348 --> 46:41.937
Also a little impressive.
I mean, one punch?

46:41.971 --> 46:43.352
That's why they call me Rambo.
Don't.

46:43.386 --> 46:46.700
Always draw the first blood.
Oh my God.

46:46.734 --> 46:49.013
Do you remember those
ammo belts that you made

46:49.047 --> 46:53.465
with the toilet paper rolls?
Dad never let me have the
real thing.

46:53.500 --> 46:56.020
You were six.

46:58.194 --> 47:01.025
Did he tell you about the
court summons?

47:01.059 --> 47:03.510
What court summons?

47:08.687 --> 47:13.071
â™ª rising organ

47:36.577 --> 47:38.545
Sweetheart, you have to eat
something.

47:38.579 --> 47:42.169
I'm not hungry.
At least have a salad.

47:42.204 --> 47:45.414
You think that hunger strike's
hurting anybody but you?

47:45.448 --> 47:47.174
That hippie crap never worked.

47:47.209 --> 47:48.866
I'm not doing a hunger strike.

47:48.900 --> 47:51.247
Why's she on strike?
You know, I ran into Betsy

47:51.282 --> 47:54.181
Your sister wants to run away.
What?

47:54.216 --> 47:56.183
I never said that.
Well then what?

47:56.218 --> 47:59.531
What is it? The water pressure?
Aunt Flo still in town?

47:59.566 --> 48:00.532
Grant.

48:00.567 --> 48:03.052
Hey come on, we're just having
fun.

48:03.087 --> 48:05.710
Where you going?
My room.

48:05.744 --> 48:08.057
Sit down.

48:09.403 --> 48:12.027
Let's talk about this after
dinner.

48:12.061 --> 48:13.545
No, we'll talk about it now.

48:13.580 --> 48:16.031
She needs to learn loyalty and
respect.

48:16.065 --> 48:18.619
I give respect to people who
deserve it.
Not...

48:18.654 --> 48:20.173
- The Admiral?
- Can you just call him Dad?

48:20.207 --> 48:24.280
We live in the fucking
desert. Military rank doesn't
depend on station.

48:24.315 --> 48:27.801
- It depends on time served
and...
-b Excellence proven.

48:27.835 --> 48:29.285
You gave that to yourself.

48:29.320 --> 48:33.048
As President. There's a clear
separation
of powers, and your doubt

48:33.082 --> 48:34.912
There's no doubt.
I know you're full of shit.

48:34.946 --> 48:39.744
You're gonna shut your goddamn
mouth until you can speak to me
with respect.

48:39.778 --> 48:42.057
- Grant.
- Quit standing up for
her. Quit letting her go
like that.

48:42.091 --> 48:45.232
- Where do you think she
learned this?
- Mom has nothing
to do with this.

48:45.267 --> 48:49.581
She spoiled you rotten, so now
you're just so, so...

48:49.616 --> 48:51.411
Intelligent?
No.

48:51.445 --> 48:52.930
Decent?

48:52.964 --> 48:54.621
Sorry I'm not a
psycho in training like Kyle.

48:54.655 --> 48:57.486
- What's that supposed to mean?- I think we've all said a few
things

48:57.520 --> 48:59.591
we regret, so
- Quit trying to make peace.

48:59.626 --> 49:01.593
- We're past that.
- What's that supposed to mean?

49:01.628 --> 49:03.423
- It means you're a traitor.
- How?

49:03.457 --> 49:07.082
Stealing state secrets.
Reading mail that isn't yours.

49:07.116 --> 49:08.083
- What mail?
- Kyle!

49:08.117 --> 49:10.292
- Sorry, I had to.
- Don't apologize, son.

49:10.326 --> 49:11.776
You did the right thing. You?

49:11.810 --> 49:14.606
I don't even know what to say
to you. Hell, I'd throw you in
the brig

49:14.641 --> 49:16.263
if I had one.
- We can build one.

49:16.298 --> 49:19.094
- You're both insane.
- And you're a liar.

49:19.128 --> 49:23.512
This is a house of honesty
and you're a regular Rosenberg.

49:23.857 --> 49:26.170
Are you kidding?

49:27.999 --> 49:30.174
We're liars.

49:30.726 --> 49:33.039
All of us.

49:33.556 --> 49:37.008
Kyle thinks this is real.

49:37.043 --> 49:41.047
Mom pretends like we're okay.

49:42.082 --> 49:45.327
And you're just a grown man
who never left his tree fort.

49:45.361 --> 49:46.984
- Savannah, please.
- No, this is good.

49:47.018 --> 49:48.261
We should get
it all out.

49:48.295 --> 49:50.642
Yeah, let the snowflake say
what's on her mind. What is it?

49:50.677 --> 49:53.818
You emotionally
scarred because we
never got you a pink
convertible?

49:53.852 --> 49:57.718
Did you tell Mom about
the court summons? Grant,
what is she talking
about?

49:57.753 --> 49:59.030
Nothing.
Just another letter from
Raymond.

49:59.065 --> 50:03.828
No, not from Raymond.
The court sent it. A legal
summons.

50:03.862 --> 50:06.348
- When were you going to tell
me?
- There's nothing to tell.

50:06.382 --> 50:10.007
Raymond's bluffing, and I'm
gonna call him on it.
Simple as that.

50:10.041 --> 50:14.011
Our real worry is here. This
spy, going through things
that ain't hers.

50:14.045 --> 50:17.048
This is serious.
They could put you in jail for
contempt.

50:17.083 --> 50:19.499
- On whose authority?
- If you went over and
apologized

50:19.533 --> 50:24.538
Apologize? For what? For what?
For standing up for my
Godgiven right

50:24.573 --> 50:26.333
to stand up and defend my
nation?

50:26.368 --> 50:29.233
I'm the one whose rights
are being infringed upon.

50:29.267 --> 50:31.545
I'm being stripped of my land
without due process.

50:31.580 --> 50:33.685
Isn't that the point of court?
Due proccess?

50:33.720 --> 50:38.035
That kangaroo court in town
is nothing but hostility and
outright bullshit.

50:38.069 --> 50:41.038
Sounds familiar.
Where the hell are you going?

50:41.072 --> 50:43.350
My room.

50:43.385 --> 50:46.043
Unless the inquisition is
still happening.

50:46.077 --> 50:48.735
We could all use a break.

50:52.256 --> 50:54.258
All right.

50:54.292 --> 50:58.055
This isn't a truce, just a
cease fire.

50:58.572 --> 51:00.988
Whatever.

51:01.299 --> 51:04.371
We're on total lockdown
tonight.

51:04.406 --> 51:06.787
Alarms. Sensors.

51:07.271 --> 51:09.790
Everything.

51:13.415 --> 51:18.075
â™ª dark feedback

51:37.128 --> 51:39.648
[knocks on door]

51:40.131 --> 51:44.101
I'm fine.
Are you sure?

51:47.138 --> 51:49.313
No.

51:58.839 --> 52:01.980
You know, your father didn't
mean it.

52:02.809 --> 52:05.605
He doesn't mean anything he
says

52:05.639 --> 52:07.124
and he's always talking.

52:07.158 --> 52:12.129
And Kyle only gets to talk
because
he repeats whatever Dad says.

52:13.164 --> 52:15.787
They both have strong beliefs.

52:15.822 --> 52:19.066
Do you think he believes any
of it?

52:19.998 --> 52:22.173
Freedom from government,

52:22.208 --> 52:25.038
fighting the liberal
conspiracy.

52:25.072 --> 52:28.490
Whoever it is he hates this
week.

52:29.180 --> 52:32.459
Sweetie, he's your father.
I know.

52:32.494 --> 52:36.808
That's exactly why I need to
do something. I mean, I can't
turn out like Kyle.

52:36.843 --> 52:41.675
He's like a perfect clone, onlyworse because Kyle actually
believes it.

52:41.710 --> 52:43.160
I mean, Kyle's...

52:43.194 --> 52:47.060
gonna die or get arrested and
Dad doesn't even care.

52:47.094 --> 52:48.993
He just wants to play
President.

52:49.027 --> 52:55.033
It's been an emotional
night for everyone. Okay?
If you just get a good
night's sleep,

52:55.068 --> 52:59.348
you're gonna wake up and feel
much better.
- Mom.

53:01.247 --> 53:04.042
This is serious.

53:04.077 --> 53:05.734
I need to leave.

53:05.768 --> 53:08.219
- For my own safety.
- Don't talk like that.

53:08.254 --> 53:12.948
Okay? I would never
let anything happen to you.

53:14.087 --> 53:16.538
I know.

53:16.952 --> 53:20.335
And trust me, your time will
come.

53:20.369 --> 53:22.716
But if you leave now,

53:23.407 --> 53:26.030
it'll hurt too much,
and you can't take that hurt
back.

53:26.064 --> 53:30.414
Mom, don't you get it?
Don't you know why I have to
leave?

53:31.415 --> 53:35.971
You will always be daughter,
no matter what happens.

53:36.420 --> 53:40.044
I love you like nothing else,
but your father...

53:40.078 --> 53:41.356
isn't as forgiving.

53:41.390 --> 53:44.911
You know, he hasn't spoken
to Uncle Bill in 14 years?

53:44.945 --> 53:47.534
Was he always such an asshole?
Language.

53:47.569 --> 53:50.572
Sorry.
He's...

53:51.573 --> 53:54.541
strong willed. Always has been.

53:54.576 --> 53:58.890
You know, the night we first
met, I told him I was voting
for Clinton

53:58.925 --> 54:02.549
and he wouldn't let me leave thebar until I promised to vote
Bush.

54:02.584 --> 54:05.069
- Did you?
- No.

54:05.103 --> 54:06.726
But it doesn't matter.

54:06.760 --> 54:10.074
If you let him win,
he'll forget all about it.

54:10.108 --> 54:13.250
Mom, you're just enabling him.

54:15.113 --> 54:18.669
I'm keeping this family
together.

54:29.127 --> 54:33.649
â™ª western rock

56:04.119 --> 56:06.017
Was it the uniform?

56:06.052 --> 56:08.226
- It didn't hurt.
- Or the power?

56:08.261 --> 56:10.194
I mean, it must be fun
to play Vice President.

56:10.228 --> 56:14.405
He wasn't President when we
met.
He was a John Deere salesman

56:14.440 --> 56:16.027
with a few crazy ideas.

56:16.062 --> 56:19.859
And one of them came true?
Not overnight.

56:19.893 --> 56:23.034
He lost his job and got more
serious.

56:23.069 --> 56:28.212
Put up the flag, started
going to conventions. But
things really picked up

56:28.246 --> 56:31.042
the last few years. He, um...

56:31.077 --> 56:33.873
found some, well,
militant groups online

56:33.907 --> 56:39.050
and they buy more courses and
beer coozies
than we can come up with.

56:39.085 --> 56:41.398
Isn't that the American dream?

56:41.432 --> 56:43.779
I suppose.

56:45.091 --> 56:48.543
Do you think he'll go for it?
Put all that behind us?

56:48.577 --> 56:54.756
I'll talk to him tonight. He's
proud, but I think he'll see the
wisdom.

56:56.758 --> 57:01.107
â™ª blues rock

57:03.765 --> 57:07.078
How you enjoying the local
brew?
It's good.

57:07.113 --> 57:09.426
Different.
That's right.

57:09.460 --> 57:11.082
Can't find beer like this in
Frisco.

57:11.117 --> 57:16.433
Yeah. Lot of flavor here.
Maybe a little bitter for my
taste though.

57:16.812 --> 57:19.436
You still talking about beer?

57:24.302 --> 57:25.614
What's got you boys so tickled?

57:25.649 --> 57:27.996
Oh, just gabbing. That's all.
Yeah, nothing worth repeating.

57:28.030 --> 57:30.930
Oh, must've been a doozy.
Nah, no, you got that wrong.

57:30.964 --> 57:34.761
I don't know, Raymond here is
ia pretty funny guy. Right,
aren't you?

57:34.796 --> 57:36.176
He's a real wisecracker.

57:36.211 --> 57:39.766
Take it easy, Grant.
No, no, it's a compliment.

57:39.801 --> 57:41.147
Ya know, it's a nice thing to
say.

57:41.181 --> 57:44.461
You here to talk, man?
Well, I was here to drink,
but you seem

57:44.495 --> 57:46.117
to have taken over this flea
shack, too.

57:46.152 --> 57:49.949
- I'm not taking over anything.- Sit down. I'll buy you a
brew, a drink.

57:49.983 --> 57:53.815
- I'm fine where I am.
- That's all right, it's all
right.

57:54.505 --> 57:57.128
He says it's all right, so
it's all right.

57:57.163 --> 57:59.959
It's okay, everything's good.

57:59.993 --> 58:01.408
Cuz he says it.

58:01.443 --> 58:04.135
Why don't you say what's on
your mind
or let us drink in peace?

58:04.170 --> 58:06.137
Why don't we do that?

58:06.172 --> 58:09.140
That's such a nice way to
tell me to fuck off.

58:09.175 --> 58:13.006
- Hey, hey now. No, no, I heardhim. Did you hear him?
- I heard him. The same as you.

58:13.041 --> 58:14.283
You did hear him, right?

58:14.318 --> 58:17.390
I heard him the same as you.
I know exactly what he meant.

58:17.424 --> 58:19.116
What else you got?
Well you know what?

58:19.150 --> 58:21.981
I'll be happy to talk
property lines here and
now. I got no interest
in court.

58:22.015 --> 58:25.502
You're the one who got the law
involved. You didn't exactly
give me a choice,

58:25.536 --> 58:29.264
- did you?
- What choice did you give me?
Huh?

58:32.025 --> 58:34.027
Listen, you go ahead.

58:34.062 --> 58:36.513
Ya know, build your life.

58:36.547 --> 58:38.653
Just go ahead, don't worry
about me.

58:38.687 --> 58:42.070
I'll be fine.
I'll just take whatever scraps
are left.

58:42.104 --> 58:44.659
We're talking ten feet, that's
all.

58:44.693 --> 58:49.836
Yeah, is that all? Just alittle minor invasion, a littleincursion, a little slice of my
nation, my homeland.

58:49.871 --> 58:53.875
Why don't you see if Jim wants aslice, too. Think your judge
would go for that?

58:53.909 --> 58:56.533
- I got nothing to do with this.
- I know. You're too

58:56.567 --> 58:58.224
goddamn dumb, Jim, to trust.

58:58.258 --> 59:01.020
- All right, no, Grant. It's
time to go.
- Pour me another.

59:01.054 --> 59:03.194
- It's time to go.
- Pour me one.

59:03.229 --> 59:08.579
Listen, I'll come by
tonight and we'll talk this
out. Okay?

59:08.614 --> 59:11.858
One step on my property,

59:11.893 --> 59:14.723
and I'll declare it an act of
war.

59:39.092 --> 59:41.750
You missed dinner.

59:44.615 --> 59:48.067
I stopped by next door,
had a nice chat with Vanessa.

59:48.101 --> 59:50.069
Don't trust a word she says.

59:50.103 --> 59:53.244
You know, we can shoot this
tomorrow, and just take some
time to think it over

59:53.279 --> 59:56.420
and maybe sleep it off.
No, goddamn it. We're gonna
go right now

59:56.454 --> 1:00:00.113
while I'm feeling it.
Feeling what exactly?

1:00:00.286 --> 1:00:04.462
This is completely insane,
like a thousand steps too far.

1:00:04.497 --> 1:00:08.432
You dare to challenge me.
You dare to insult me. You
dare to dare.

1:00:08.466 --> 1:00:10.434
Kyle, this is gonna be a crime.

1:00:10.468 --> 1:00:12.436
Which one?
Depends how far it goes,

1:00:12.470 --> 1:00:14.093
but at least a few
misdemeanors.

1:00:14.127 --> 1:00:16.820
Then we have to make it
extra convincing.

1:00:16.854 --> 1:00:18.269
Make sure he doesn't snitch.

1:00:18.304 --> 1:00:19.857
Do we still have that
dynamite?
Okay, that's it.

1:00:19.892 --> 1:00:24.137
I'm not going to jail for you
clowns. Get fucking back behind
that camera

1:00:24.172 --> 1:00:27.037
and you fucking press play.

1:00:28.003 --> 1:00:31.282
Follow me.
Keep that camera right on me.

1:00:31.317 --> 1:00:33.975
Give me that knife.

1:00:36.011 --> 1:00:38.807
[war cry]

1:00:46.021 --> 1:00:47.298
Raymond.

1:00:47.333 --> 1:00:50.647
We're not afriad of you
and we never will be.

1:00:50.681 --> 1:00:55.168
Give up your little game while
you still have what's
important:

1:00:55.203 --> 1:00:57.826
your life.

1:00:58.585 --> 1:01:03.038
[war cries]

1:01:05.731 --> 1:01:08.009
And if you call the cops

1:01:08.043 --> 1:01:12.358
that'll be the last call you
ever make.

1:01:14.015 --> 1:01:16.845
Next time, I won't miss.

1:01:20.021 --> 1:01:22.851
Is that real?

1:01:25.543 --> 1:01:27.200
Kyle!

1:01:39.765 --> 1:01:42.181
Grant.

1:01:42.215 --> 1:01:43.216
What's this?

1:01:43.251 --> 1:01:47.565
We have a guest.
Is that Raymond already?

1:01:47.600 --> 1:01:49.429
Good morning, Grant.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1:01:49.464 --> 1:01:51.190
Do we have to do this now?
Do not

1:01:51.224 --> 1:01:56.367
It's all right, Candice. He's atroubled ma and trouble leads
to blasphemy.

1:01:56.402 --> 1:01:59.543
Is that why you're here?
To cure me of my cursing?

1:01:59.577 --> 1:02:02.857
I'm here to talk, that's all.

1:02:02.891 --> 1:02:06.584
About what?
Whatever you like.

1:02:09.070 --> 1:02:10.761
Oh, right.

1:02:10.796 --> 1:02:13.039
Can I get some coffee first?

1:02:13.074 --> 1:02:16.905
We haven't seen you
at services in some time.

1:02:16.940 --> 1:02:20.426
Well, we got the same book
here.

1:02:22.911 --> 1:02:25.776
Don't you miss the community,
though?

1:02:25.811 --> 1:02:28.745
The gathering of the spirit?

1:02:29.090 --> 1:02:31.817
Not that spirit.

1:02:34.267 --> 1:02:36.753
Okay, okay.

1:02:38.099 --> 1:02:40.895
I saw your video from last
night.

1:02:40.929 --> 1:02:42.241
What? How?

1:02:42.275 --> 1:02:44.899
Candice showed it to me.
What the hell?

1:02:44.933 --> 1:02:47.073
I couldn't let you send that
to Raymond.

1:02:47.108 --> 1:02:51.595
She did the right thing.
The threats you made...

1:02:51.629 --> 1:02:56.289
If Raymond were to have given
that to the police, you'd be in
jail already.

1:02:56.324 --> 1:03:01.294
If Raymond saw that video,
he never would have called the
police.

1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:04.642
You were...

1:03:04.677 --> 1:03:05.989
convincing.

1:03:06.023 --> 1:03:09.130
But either road leads to more
trouble.

1:03:09.475 --> 1:03:11.995
Instead of making war,

1:03:12.029 --> 1:03:15.515
why don't you try the Lord's
way
and love thy neighbor?

1:03:15.550 --> 1:03:18.518
Ya know, if your pal Jesus saw
our world,

1:03:18.553 --> 1:03:22.039
he'd cut that 'turn the other
cheek' crap
real quick.

1:03:22.074 --> 1:03:23.316
Grant.

1:03:23.351 --> 1:03:28.011
Hey, he thought Sodom was
something.
Try San Francisco.

1:03:36.053 --> 1:03:38.711
I'll pray for you.

1:03:39.056 --> 1:03:42.025
Don't waste your breath.

1:03:46.029 --> 1:03:50.412
â™ª eerie rock

1:06:22.150 --> 1:06:24.739
â™ª music fades out

1:06:44.069 --> 1:06:46.036
What the hell?

1:06:46.071 --> 1:06:48.176
Do not enter my office without
knocking.

1:06:48.211 --> 1:06:49.488
That's not in the constitution.

1:06:49.522 --> 1:06:52.525
Is there a reason you're here?
What is this map? An invasion?

1:06:52.560 --> 1:06:56.046
You are a spy, aren't you? Firstyou steal my tape and give it to
your mother.

1:06:56.081 --> 1:06:58.048
Now you're snooping through
my office
Well, it's not hard when

1:06:58.083 --> 1:07:01.327
you're passed out drunk.
Goddamn it, I will not be
spoken to

1:07:01.362 --> 1:07:04.227
like that by my own daughter.
Well, then stop all the
bullshit

1:07:04.261 --> 1:07:08.058
and do the right thing. Are you
seriously gonna risk everything

1:07:08.093 --> 1:07:10.060
for ten feet of land?

1:07:10.095 --> 1:07:12.166
What is the right thing?

1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:15.859
Hmm? Grovel at the feet of
that,
that, that...

1:07:15.893 --> 1:07:18.689
smug bastard?
You don't have to talk to
Raymond.

1:07:18.724 --> 1:07:21.071
Just go to the court,
tell them it was a mistake,

1:07:21.106 --> 1:07:24.074
and then move the fence back.
It was no mistake.

1:07:24.109 --> 1:07:26.076
Me and McGregor had an
agreement.

1:07:26.111 --> 1:07:27.353
Well, if you had proof...

1:07:27.388 --> 1:07:30.184
Since when does a man need
proof
beyond his own word?

1:07:30.218 --> 1:07:32.082
Since always.

1:07:32.117 --> 1:07:36.086
Sir. I'm ready to
take the fight to Raymond.

1:07:36.121 --> 1:07:37.536
What? You're a spy, too?

1:07:37.570 --> 1:07:40.194
Just doing my duty.
What are my orders?

1:07:40.228 --> 1:07:42.058
Do you guys hear yourselves?

1:07:42.092 --> 1:07:46.441
You're like one step away
from mailing out anthrax.

1:07:52.102 --> 1:07:54.898
You're packed, ready to go?
Yes, sir.

1:07:54.932 --> 1:07:56.210
All right.

1:07:56.244 --> 1:07:58.902
Under cover of darkness

1:07:58.936 --> 1:08:01.111
we're gonna show Raymond what
we mean.

1:08:01.146 --> 1:08:05.219
- What do we mean?
- To take out that pump.

1:08:05.253 --> 1:08:07.773
For good.

1:08:14.124 --> 1:08:17.093
This is highly sensitive
material.

1:08:17.127 --> 1:08:19.578
Yes, sir. I know.

1:08:19.612 --> 1:08:22.098
Grant. We need to talk.

1:08:22.960 --> 1:08:25.170
Dismissed.

1:08:28.276 --> 1:08:29.933
Savannah told me your plan.

1:08:29.967 --> 1:08:33.281
You have to stop this war
and settle things in court.

1:08:33.316 --> 1:08:34.696
What war?

1:08:34.731 --> 1:08:38.114
If you don't go, they'll
decide against us
and take that land back.

1:08:38.148 --> 1:08:40.599
And more for the trouble.
We could lose everything.

1:08:40.633 --> 1:08:42.773
They can't do that.
They can and will.

1:08:42.808 --> 1:08:46.950
We're cash poor, and after the
third
mortgage, the bank owns

1:08:46.984 --> 1:08:48.607
more of the house than we do.
Cash poor?

1:08:48.641 --> 1:08:50.781
What about the savings
account?
That's for college,

1:08:50.816 --> 1:08:55.993
for Savannah and Kyle.
They don't need half that
money, if that.

1:09:01.171 --> 1:09:03.449
How many drinks have you had?

1:09:03.484 --> 1:09:06.003
Not enough.

1:09:13.183 --> 1:09:16.497
Speaking as Vice President.

1:09:17.394 --> 1:09:19.879
What?

1:09:19.914 --> 1:09:23.814
This is a national emergency
and you are unfit to lead.

1:09:23.849 --> 1:09:26.300
Oh, you're gonna impeach me?
You don't have the votes.

1:09:26.334 --> 1:09:31.063
I want you to act up to
your title. To behave like
a president, not a tyrant.

1:09:31.097 --> 1:09:32.996
You don't think I'm
presidential?

1:09:33.030 --> 1:09:37.656
That's okay. Neither do I.
I'm more of a...philosopher
king.

1:09:37.690 --> 1:09:42.592
Whatever you call yourself,
you are failing your country.

1:09:43.248 --> 1:09:47.217
Better to die free,
than live a slave.

1:09:47.528 --> 1:09:49.909
Where are your chains?
Where is your burden?

1:09:49.944 --> 1:09:55.674
You wanna know where my burden
is? You wanna see what's holding
me back?

1:09:55.708 --> 1:09:59.125
Go look in the goddamn mirror.

1:10:01.127 --> 1:10:03.682
You don't mean that.

1:10:03.716 --> 1:10:07.410
I could've dealt with Raymond
if it weren't for you.

1:10:08.411 --> 1:10:10.067
And Savannah?

1:10:10.102 --> 1:10:13.347
You've been poisoning that
little girl's
head from the start.

1:10:13.381 --> 1:10:17.385
This isn't about her, or
Raymond,
or me, is it?

1:10:17.765 --> 1:10:20.526
This is about you. Like it
always is.

1:10:20.561 --> 1:10:24.081
Yeah? Just keep talking,
and I'll tell you what it's
about.

1:10:24.116 --> 1:10:26.429
I'll show you what it's about.
Grant, don't.

1:10:26.463 --> 1:10:29.086
Keep talking.

1:10:34.747 --> 1:10:37.094
Candice.

1:10:38.820 --> 1:10:41.098
Babe.

1:11:03.293 --> 1:11:06.434
It's you.
I knew you weren't really one
of us, but

1:11:06.469 --> 1:11:09.817
I didn't think you'd betray
the Republic.

1:11:09.851 --> 1:11:12.095
Excuse me?

1:11:12.129 --> 1:11:14.097
Attempted desertion,

1:11:14.131 --> 1:11:16.099
espionage, exposing state
secrets.

1:11:16.133 --> 1:11:18.584
You mean, because I showed Mom
your insane video?

1:11:18.619 --> 1:11:23.106
This goes way deeper than one
leak. It's a pattern of sabotage
and disrespect.

1:11:23.140 --> 1:11:25.660
I'm not playing your stupid
game.
It's not a game.

1:11:25.695 --> 1:11:27.835
Are you sure?
Now can you just leave me alone

1:11:27.869 --> 1:11:32.529
because I need to find out
what happens
when Dad fucks everything up.

1:11:33.461 --> 1:11:37.120
Kyle. Go see if it's dark
enough.

1:11:37.154 --> 1:11:39.502
Yes, sir.

1:11:49.374 --> 1:11:52.031
You think I'm gonna fuck
everything up?

1:11:52.066 --> 1:11:54.482
It's a safe bet.

1:11:59.004 --> 1:12:01.386
Fuck you.

1:12:04.354 --> 1:12:08.910
â™ª dark organ

1:12:25.686 --> 1:12:28.067
Honey, are you okay?

1:12:29.206 --> 1:12:31.519
No.

1:12:33.279 --> 1:12:37.042
[gasp]
Oh my God. What happened?

1:12:37.076 --> 1:12:39.527
I told him the truth.

1:12:39.907 --> 1:12:42.116
Your father?

1:12:43.220 --> 1:12:45.257
That son of a bitch.

1:12:45.291 --> 1:12:46.672
Where's Kyle?
I don't know,

1:12:46.707 --> 1:12:50.227
he just left all geared up
for something.
No, no, I can't...

1:12:50.262 --> 1:12:52.091
I can't leave him alone.
Mom.

1:12:52.126 --> 1:12:54.749
We have to wait.
Mom, what are you talking
about?

1:12:54.784 --> 1:12:57.027
We're getting you out of here
tonight.

1:12:57.062 --> 1:12:58.926
You're coming with me.
I can't.

1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:01.031
Mom, why? What can you do here?

1:13:01.066 --> 1:13:03.551
Kyle needs me.
Mom, please.

1:13:03.586 --> 1:13:07.452
I can't leave him alone with
your father.

1:13:16.633 --> 1:13:18.428
- How was the mission?
- What mission?

1:13:18.463 --> 1:13:22.881
- That was a goddamn snipe hunt.
- Watch your tone.

1:13:22.915 --> 1:13:24.883
You sent me out there with a
dud.

1:13:24.917 --> 1:13:27.057
Why? To run me tired and shut
me up?

1:13:27.092 --> 1:13:29.266
- Explosive didn't work?
- You know it didn't.

1:13:29.301 --> 1:13:33.063
Well, you must have knocked a
casing,
slipped a wire loose.

1:13:33.098 --> 1:13:35.721
I hit the detonator, and
nothing happened.

1:13:35.756 --> 1:13:38.241
So I went back to check,
see if I'd set it right.

1:13:38.275 --> 1:13:42.072
Sure enough, I was detonating
a bag full of newspapers.

1:13:42.107 --> 1:13:46.111
- There must be some mistake.
- Cover of darkness.

1:13:46.145 --> 1:13:48.596
Right, Pop?

1:13:51.461 --> 1:13:55.810
Good work, soldier.
Mission accomplished.

1:13:56.604 --> 1:13:59.607
This is the good stuff.

1:13:59.642 --> 1:14:01.091
Pure as it gets.

1:14:01.126 --> 1:14:05.130
And straight up.
Just like God intended.

1:14:05.682 --> 1:14:09.341
Mmm. Goes down smooth as you
like.

1:14:09.997 --> 1:14:13.000
I'm not gonna toast myself.

1:14:20.145 --> 1:14:24.321
Once you get past the burn,
you and bourbon will be fast
friends.

1:14:25.322 --> 1:14:27.117
This was a test?

1:14:27.152 --> 1:14:30.017
And you passed. With flying
colors.

1:14:30.051 --> 1:14:33.020
- Keep this up and you'll earn
a promotion.
- To what?

1:14:33.054 --> 1:14:35.505
- How's staff sergeant sound?
- Pointless.

1:14:35.540 --> 1:14:37.473
- We don't have a staff.
- Not yet.

1:14:37.507 --> 1:14:41.166
- And corporal comes after
private.
- Well, that's in peacetime.

1:14:41.200 --> 1:14:43.858
We're a nation at war.

1:14:49.554 --> 1:14:53.212
Wow, easy soldier.
You got patrol duty tonight.

1:14:53.247 --> 1:14:54.628
- I'm done.
- I can see that.

1:14:54.662 --> 1:14:57.631
No, with you and your
bullshit.
Hey, watch what you say next.

1:14:57.665 --> 1:15:01.704
- Why? Nothing matters to you,
right?
- This bomb's a fucking fake,
just like you.

1:15:01.738 --> 1:15:03.878
- Stand down, soldier.
- I'm not your soldier,

1:15:03.913 --> 1:15:05.984
and you're not my Admiral.

1:15:06.018 --> 1:15:08.504
You can't leave.

1:15:09.021 --> 1:15:11.437
You can't stop me.

1:15:12.024 --> 1:15:14.510
I can out run you.

1:15:14.544 --> 1:15:15.994
Out fight you.

1:15:16.028 --> 1:15:18.652
- Out shoot you.
- You didn't say outsmart.

1:15:18.686 --> 1:15:21.827
- It won't come to that.
- Kyle. Thank God you're all
right.

1:15:21.862 --> 1:15:23.657
Why wouldn't he be?
Did you send him out there

1:15:23.691 --> 1:15:26.383
to blow up Raymond's pump?
Don't worry, he didn't do it.

1:15:26.418 --> 1:15:27.902
- Cuz you gave me a fucking toy!
- Honey!

1:15:27.937 --> 1:15:30.353
Do not speak to your
commanding officer
with that tone of voice,

1:15:30.387 --> 1:15:33.425
with that disrespect.
- You don't deserve my respect.

1:15:33.459 --> 1:15:36.842
Oh, listen to that mouth.
Your Marines would have you
eating boot

1:15:36.877 --> 1:15:39.017
soon as you got off the bus.
- What do you know about the
Marines?

1:15:39.051 --> 1:15:41.019
I served.
In the Merchant Marines
because you

1:15:41.053 --> 1:15:44.540
didn't have the gut for war.
[bitter laugh]

1:15:54.066 --> 1:15:55.689
Did you do that to her?

1:15:55.723 --> 1:15:59.037
- She did it to herself.
- You fucking coward.

1:15:59.071 --> 1:16:01.557
Savannah, we should go.

1:16:01.591 --> 1:16:04.042
No, no. You should stay.

1:16:04.076 --> 1:16:07.390
Yeah, I want everybody
to hear this treason.

1:16:07.424 --> 1:16:09.772
So you wanna join the Marines,
prove what a big man you are?

1:16:09.806 --> 1:16:13.120
I'm not proving anything.
I want to fight. Actually
shoot people,

1:16:13.154 --> 1:16:14.949
not play in the backyard.
Oh, yeah?

1:16:14.984 --> 1:16:18.884
You wanna fight? Then why don't
we just square off right now?

1:16:18.919 --> 1:16:20.748
- Grant.
- No, no this is good.

1:16:20.783 --> 1:16:24.476
- You want a piece of your old
man?
- Hit him, Kyle.

1:16:24.510 --> 1:16:26.236
- Pop me, son.
- Stop it, both of you.

1:16:26.271 --> 1:16:29.619
No, this is between me and
the boy. I'm a man, goddamn
it. I'm not your boy.

1:16:29.654 --> 1:16:32.484
- You're my boy for the next sixmonths.
- Says who, the
Americans?

1:16:32.518 --> 1:16:36.074
- Their laws mean nothing to
you, right?
- What does that
mean?

1:16:36.108 --> 1:16:39.077
You're still playing by
their rules,
living in their world.

1:16:39.111 --> 1:16:42.736
Call yourself whatever
you'd like, but you're not
special.

1:16:42.770 --> 1:16:45.635
You're another stupid American.

1:16:45.670 --> 1:16:46.636
I...

1:16:46.671 --> 1:16:49.156
am the Admiral of Kallipoly!

1:16:49.190 --> 1:16:52.469
You're a dipshit playing
dressup.

1:16:55.818 --> 1:16:58.027
Whoa.

1:16:59.062 --> 1:17:03.480
I didn't mean that.
You know, you surprised me.

1:17:11.040 --> 1:17:12.282
Okay.

1:17:12.317 --> 1:17:16.632
A shot for a shot. We're
square.

1:17:19.013 --> 1:17:21.464
- Kyle, that's your father.
- I know.

1:17:21.498 --> 1:17:24.778
- Mom, go pack the car now.
- I need, he needs me.

1:17:24.812 --> 1:17:25.986
We're leaving tonight.

1:17:26.020 --> 1:17:27.988
- Don't hurt him any more.
- I won't if he stays down.

1:17:28.022 --> 1:17:30.473
-Kyle, you're coming with us.
- Where are you going?

1:17:30.507 --> 1:17:31.992
- Aunt Carol's.
- The hell you are!

1:17:32.026 --> 1:17:36.030
- Mom, pack the car now. Please.
- Go on.

1:17:43.037 --> 1:17:44.556
What are you doing?

1:17:44.590 --> 1:17:48.008
Completing the mission.
Is that...

1:17:48.042 --> 1:17:50.044
Kyle that's real dynamite.

1:17:50.079 --> 1:17:53.979
You can't do this.
It's pointless, it's all
bullshit.

1:17:54.014 --> 1:17:55.394
So you said.

1:17:55.429 --> 1:17:57.983
You're going to risk
everything for
a plan that never made sense.

1:17:58.018 --> 1:17:59.813
What are you going to
accomplish out there?

1:17:59.847 --> 1:18:02.505
Something.
I'm going to actually do
something.

1:18:02.539 --> 1:18:05.508
- I have to defend our nation.
- I thought you were done with
him.

1:18:05.542 --> 1:18:07.510
I am. But this asshole's
too weak to lift a finger

1:18:07.544 --> 1:18:10.513
and we have barbarians at the
gate.
- Well, what about the Marines?

1:18:10.547 --> 1:18:13.067
They won't take you if you're
arrested
for domestic terrorism.

1:18:13.102 --> 1:18:17.209
- That's crazy. Do I look like
a terrorist?
- Yes!

1:18:19.039 --> 1:18:21.282
Kyle.

1:18:21.731 --> 1:18:25.045
Please don't do this.

1:18:25.873 --> 1:18:28.186
I have to.
This is who I am.

1:18:28.220 --> 1:18:32.017
I know Dad's a fucking moron,
but not everything he said was
wrong.

1:18:32.052 --> 1:18:34.019
All we need is a few tweaks
to the constitution and

1:18:34.054 --> 1:18:36.021
a new leader with a vision.
- And that's you?

1:18:36.056 --> 1:18:40.025
Why not? You could be my
VP, help me rebrand
everything, starting with

1:18:40.060 --> 1:18:42.718
the name. Kallipoly. I mean,
what does that even mean?

1:18:42.752 --> 1:18:47.412
It's from Plato, kind of.
And look.

1:18:48.068 --> 1:18:49.897
It's really sweet

1:18:49.932 --> 1:18:53.625
that you want me
to nurse your delusions.

1:18:53.936 --> 1:18:56.283
But I'm out of here.

1:18:56.317 --> 1:18:58.768
For good.

1:18:59.424 --> 1:19:01.460
So you're gonna leave

1:19:01.495 --> 1:19:03.773
and you're never gonna come
back?

1:19:03.808 --> 1:19:06.155
That's the plan.

1:19:07.087 --> 1:19:09.779
Then your vote doesn't count.

1:19:09.814 --> 1:19:11.436
Kyle!

1:19:11.470 --> 1:19:14.750
Say something, you can stop
him!

1:19:14.784 --> 1:19:17.097
Mom!

1:19:25.105 --> 1:19:29.454
â™ª dark drone

1:19:51.476 --> 1:19:53.650
It's quiet.

1:19:53.685 --> 1:19:55.480
Mmhmm.

1:19:56.205 --> 1:19:58.828
You think she talked him down?

1:19:58.863 --> 1:20:00.105
We'll see.

1:20:00.140 --> 1:20:02.694
I'm just tired of talking
about him,

1:20:02.728 --> 1:20:07.354
worrying, trying to predict
what crazy thing he'll do next.

1:20:07.837 --> 1:20:09.287
Yeah, me too.

1:20:09.321 --> 1:20:12.808
Is that why you riled him up?
Let him play the big man at
the bar?

1:20:12.842 --> 1:20:16.294
I was trying to settle it.
You gave him a stage.

1:20:16.328 --> 1:20:18.641
Who knows what he'll play at
next.

1:20:18.675 --> 1:20:19.849
[distant]
Kyle!

1:20:19.884 --> 1:20:22.196
- Did you hear something?
- Don't change the subject.

1:20:22.231 --> 1:20:25.544
- No, V. I'm serious.
- Kyle!

1:20:28.685 --> 1:20:30.998
Kyle?

1:20:36.176 --> 1:20:39.489
No, nothing's happened yet,
but it's about to.

1:20:39.524 --> 1:20:43.977
He has a stick of dynamite.
That's right.

1:20:44.011 --> 1:20:46.324
No, my husband did. I know.

1:20:46.358 --> 1:20:52.364
Please, just send anyone you
can. Sheriff, ambulances, maybe
a fire engine.

1:20:54.021 --> 1:20:56.990
You sent our son out there
with a bomb? What the hell is
wrong with you?

1:20:57.024 --> 1:21:01.995
- That boy has got a mind of
his own.
- Grant. It's over.

1:21:02.029 --> 1:21:03.893
[phone ringing]

1:21:03.928 --> 1:21:09.002
Baby. No, no...
Whoa. It's me. Okay?

1:21:09.036 --> 1:21:13.075
Let me fix it. I can fix it.
Let me fix him.

1:21:13.109 --> 1:21:15.008
Okay? All right?

1:21:15.042 --> 1:21:17.424
No, no, no...please.

1:21:17.458 --> 1:21:19.736
I love you.
You're everything to me.

1:21:19.771 --> 1:21:25.432
-Grant, I have to do right by
- our kids.
The kids are gonna be fine.

1:21:25.466 --> 1:21:27.192
[explosion]

1:21:27.227 --> 1:21:30.023
No. Oh my God.

1:21:30.057 --> 1:21:34.579
â™ª dark piano

1:21:45.245 --> 1:21:47.972
â™ª music fades out

1:21:54.081 --> 1:21:58.603
â™ª twangy rock

1:22:05.610 --> 1:22:08.095
[door opens]

1:22:10.132 --> 1:22:12.065
Goddamn it.

1:22:12.099 --> 1:22:14.584
All right listen,
I don't want any trouble.

1:22:14.619 --> 1:22:17.070
It's all right, man.
Neither do I.

1:22:17.104 --> 1:22:18.657
Come to peacock?

1:22:18.692 --> 1:22:20.970
No, I just saw your boy at the
hospital.

1:22:21.005 --> 1:22:25.078
He's out of bed already.
Doc's orders be damned, huh?

1:22:25.112 --> 1:22:27.459
Right.

1:22:29.013 --> 1:22:33.810
- You been to visit?
- No, not just yet.

1:22:43.027 --> 1:22:46.099
- Well, go on and order
something.
- I'm not staying long.

1:22:46.133 --> 1:22:50.551
Oh come on, Ray.
Don't make me drink alone.

1:22:57.041 --> 1:23:00.009
How'd you know I'd be here?

1:23:00.354 --> 1:23:02.978
I guessed.

1:23:05.704 --> 1:23:09.501
To the death of freedom
and victory over cowardice.

1:23:09.536 --> 1:23:12.021
Here's to peace.

1:23:16.543 --> 1:23:20.823
You know, Grant, I hope things
work out
for you, man. I really do.

1:23:20.857 --> 1:23:23.032
I'll bet.

1:23:23.550 --> 1:23:27.209
And, not to speak out of turn,
but you should see your boy.

1:23:27.243 --> 1:23:29.383
Whatever's between you, it can
be fixed.

1:23:29.418 --> 1:23:33.008
Is that right? Yeah, I'll bet
you got an answer for
everything.

1:23:33.042 --> 1:23:37.012
- I should be leaving.
- Hey, hey...

1:23:37.357 --> 1:23:42.017
Don't quit now. We're just
getting somewhere. You got

1:23:42.051 --> 1:23:46.193
bottles of beer here. Plenty
of it.
- You know...

1:23:46.228 --> 1:23:49.024
Ever since you moved into the
neighborhood, you know,

1:23:49.058 --> 1:23:52.682
you were all smiles.
- You were really neighborly.

1:23:52.717 --> 1:23:57.032
Behind that smile was a
goddamn rat.

1:23:58.136 --> 1:24:01.036
- You know, I don't know where
you get these ideas.
- No, you just...

1:24:01.070 --> 1:24:04.522
You took everything from me,
you barely left me a bottle.

1:24:04.556 --> 1:24:09.285
I hope you're happy
with your goddamn spread.

1:24:09.734 --> 1:24:12.185
Grant, It wasn't personal. It
was my land.

1:24:12.219 --> 1:24:15.878
You wanted what was mine,
and you took it.

1:24:15.912 --> 1:24:18.881
My birthright. Everything.

1:24:18.915 --> 1:24:23.092
Now, if that ain't personal,
I don't know what is.

1:24:23.127 --> 1:24:24.128
Look man, I'm trying

1:24:24.162 --> 1:24:27.062
I was promised the world
and now I got nothing.

1:24:27.096 --> 1:24:32.412
- All right, Grant. Can we
just.
- No, no, it's fine. I'm
leaving.

1:24:33.275 --> 1:24:35.760
Hey, Ray?

1:24:36.105 --> 1:24:37.589
Yeah?

1:24:37.624 --> 1:24:40.247
How'd my wife look?

1:24:40.799 --> 1:24:44.389
Happier. Take care, Grant.

1:24:44.424 --> 1:24:47.082
Fuck you.

1:24:54.848 --> 1:24:58.093
To freedom!

1:25:02.614 --> 1:25:05.100
Every man's got a choice:

1:25:06.860 --> 1:25:09.104
he can play their game

1:25:09.138 --> 1:25:11.485
or strike out on his own.

1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:14.661
Play his own game,
with his own rules...
