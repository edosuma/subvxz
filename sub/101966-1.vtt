1:06:49.522 --> 1:06:52.525
Is there a reason you're here?
What is this map? An invasion?

1:06:52.560 --> 1:06:56.046
You are a spy, aren't you? Firstyou steal my tape and give it to
your mother.

1:06:56.081 --> 1:06:58.048
Now you're snooping through
my office
Well, it's not hard when

1:06:58.083 --> 1:07:01.327
you're passed out drunk.
Goddamn it, I will not be
spoken to

1:07:01.362 --> 1:07:04.227
like that by my own daughter.
Well, then stop all the
bullshit

1:07:04.261 --> 1:07:08.058
and do the right thing. Are you
seriously gonna risk everything

1:07:08.093 --> 1:07:10.060
for ten feet of land?

1:07:10.095 --> 1:07:12.166
What is the right thing?

1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:15.859
Hmm? Grovel at the feet of
that,
that, that...

1:07:15.893 --> 1:07:18.689
smug bastard?
You don't have to talk to
Raymond.

1:07:18.724 --> 1:07:21.071
Just go to the court,
tell them it was a mistake,

1:07:21.106 --> 1:07:24.074
and then move the fence back.
It was no mistake.

1:07:24.109 --> 1:07:26.076
Me and McGregor had an
agreement.

1:07:26.111 --> 1:07:27.353
Well, if you had proof...

1:07:27.388 --> 1:07:30.184
Since when does a man need
proof
beyond his own word?

1:07:30.218 --> 1:07:32.082
Since always.

1:07:32.117 --> 1:07:36.086
Sir. I'm ready to
take the fight to Raymond.

1:07:36.121 --> 1:07:37.536
What? You're a spy, too?

1:07:37.570 --> 1:07:40.194
Just doing my duty.
What are my orders?

1:07:40.228 --> 1:07:42.058
Do you guys hear yourselves?

1:07:42.092 --> 1:07:46.441
You're like one step away
from mailing out anthrax.

1:07:52.102 --> 1:07:54.898
You're packed, ready to go?
Yes, sir.

1:07:54.932 --> 1:07:56.210
All right.

1:07:56.244 --> 1:07:58.902
Under cover of darkness

1:07:58.936 --> 1:08:01.111
we're gonna show Raymond what
we mean.

1:08:01.146 --> 1:08:05.219
- What do we mean?
- To take out that pump.

1:08:05.253 --> 1:08:07.773
For good.

1:08:14.124 --> 1:08:17.093
This is highly sensitive
material.

1:08:17.127 --> 1:08:19.578
Yes, sir. I know.

1:08:19.612 --> 1:08:22.098
Grant. We need to talk.

1:08:22.960 --> 1:08:25.170
Dismissed.

1:08:28.276 --> 1:08:29.933
Savannah told me your plan.

1:08:29.967 --> 1:08:33.281
You have to stop this war
and settle things in court.

1:08:33.316 --> 1:08:34.696
What war?

1:08:34.731 --> 1:08:38.114
If you don't go, they'll
decide against us
and take that land back.

1:08:38.148 --> 1:08:40.599
And more for the trouble.
We could lose everything.

1:08:40.633 --> 1:08:42.773
They can't do that.
They can and will.

1:08:42.808 --> 1:08:46.950
We're cash poor, and after the
third
mortgage, the bank owns

1:08:46.984 --> 1:08:48.607
more of the house than we do.
Cash poor?

1:08:48.641 --> 1:08:50.781
What about the savings
account?
That's for college,

1:08:50.816 --> 1:08:55.993
for Savannah and Kyle.
They don't need half that
money, if that.

1:09:01.171 --> 1:09:03.449
How many drinks have you had?

1:09:03.484 --> 1:09:06.003
Not enough.

1:09:13.183 --> 1:09:16.497
Speaking as Vice President.

1:09:17.394 --> 1:09:19.879
What?

1:09:19.914 --> 1:09:23.814
This is a national emergency
and you are unfit to lead.

1:09:23.849 --> 1:09:26.300
Oh, you're gonna impeach me?
You don't have the votes.

1:09:26.334 --> 1:09:31.063
I want you to act up to
your title. To behave like
a president, not a tyrant.

1:09:31.097 --> 1:09:32.996
You don't think I'm
presidential?

1:09:33.030 --> 1:09:37.656
That's okay. Neither do I.
I'm more of a...philosopher
king.

1:09:37.690 --> 1:09:42.592
Whatever you call yourself,
you are failing your country.

1:09:43.248 --> 1:09:47.217
Better to die free,
than live a slave.

1:09:47.528 --> 1:09:49.909
Where are your chains?
Where is your burden?

1:09:49.944 --> 1:09:55.674
You wanna know where my burden
is? You wanna see what's holding
me back?

1:09:55.708 --> 1:09:59.125
Go look in the goddamn mirror.

1:10:01.127 --> 1:10:03.682
You don't mean that.

1:10:03.716 --> 1:10:07.410
I could've dealt with Raymond
if it weren't for you.

1:10:08.411 --> 1:10:10.067
And Savannah?

1:10:10.102 --> 1:10:13.347
You've been poisoning that
little girl's
head from the start.

1:10:13.381 --> 1:10:17.385
This isn't about her, or
Raymond,
or me, is it?

1:10:17.765 --> 1:10:20.526
This is about you. Like it
always is.

1:10:20.561 --> 1:10:24.081
Yeah? Just keep talking,
and I'll tell you what it's
about.

1:10:24.116 --> 1:10:26.429
I'll show you what it's about.
Grant, don't.

1:10:26.463 --> 1:10:29.086
Keep talking.

1:10:34.747 --> 1:10:37.094
Candice.

1:10:38.820 --> 1:10:41.098
Babe.

1:11:03.293 --> 1:11:06.434
It's you.
I knew you weren't really one
of us, but

1:11:06.469 --> 1:11:09.817
I didn't think you'd betray
the Republic.

1:11:09.851 --> 1:11:12.095
Excuse me?

1:11:12.129 --> 1:11:14.097
Attempted desertion,

1:11:14.131 --> 1:11:16.099
espionage, exposing state
secrets.

1:11:16.133 --> 1:11:18.584
You mean, because I showed Mom
your insane video?

1:11:18.619 --> 1:11:23.106
This goes way deeper than one
leak. It's a pattern of sabotage
and disrespect.

1:11:23.140 --> 1:11:25.660
I'm not playing your stupid
game.
It's not a game.

1:11:25.695 --> 1:11:27.835
Are you sure?
Now can you just leave me alone

1:11:27.869 --> 1:11:32.529
because I need to find out
what happens
when Dad fucks everything up.

1:11:33.461 --> 1:11:37.120
Kyle. Go see if it's dark
enough.

1:11:37.154 --> 1:11:39.502
Yes, sir.

1:11:49.374 --> 1:11:52.031
You think I'm gonna fuck
everything up?

1:11:52.066 --> 1:11:54.482
It's a safe bet.

1:11:59.004 --> 1:12:01.386
Fuck you.

1:12:04.354 --> 1:12:08.910
♪ dark organ

1:12:25.686 --> 1:12:28.067
Honey, are you okay?

1:12:29.206 --> 1:12:31.519
No.

1:12:33.279 --> 1:12:37.042
[gasp]
Oh my God. What happened?

1:12:37.076 --> 1:12:39.527
I told him the truth.

1:12:39.907 --> 1:12:42.116
Your father?

1:12:43.220 --> 1:12:45.257
That son of a bitch.

1:12:45.291 --> 1:12:46.672
Where's Kyle?
I don't know,

1:12:46.707 --> 1:12:50.227
he just left all geared up
for something.
No, no, I can't...

1:12:50.262 --> 1:12:52.091
I can't leave him alone.
Mom.

1:12:52.126 --> 1:12:54.749
We have to wait.
Mom, what are you talking
about?

1:12:54.784 --> 1:12:57.027
We're getting you out of here
tonight.

1:12:57.062 --> 1:12:58.926
You're coming with me.
I can't.

1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:01.031
Mom, why? What can you do here?

1:13:01.066 --> 1:13:03.551
Kyle needs me.
Mom, please.

1:13:03.586 --> 1:13:07.452
I can't leave him alone with
your father.

1:13:16.633 --> 1:13:18.428
- How was the mission?
- What mission?

1:13:18.463 --> 1:13:22.881
- That was a goddamn snipe hunt.
- Watch your tone.

1:13:22.915 --> 1:13:24.883
You sent me out there with a
dud.

1:13:24.917 --> 1:13:27.057
Why? To run me tired and shut
me up?

1:13:27.092 --> 1:13:29.266
- Explosive didn't work?
- You know it didn't.

1:13:29.301 --> 1:13:33.063
Well, you must have knocked a
casing,
slipped a wire loose.

1:13:33.098 --> 1:13:35.721
I hit the detonator, and
nothing happened.

1:13:35.756 --> 1:13:38.241
So I went back to check,
see if I'd set it right.

1:13:38.275 --> 1:13:42.072
Sure enough, I was detonating
a bag full of newspapers.

1:13:42.107 --> 1:13:46.111
- There must be some mistake.
- Cover of darkness.

1:13:46.145 --> 1:13:48.596
Right, Pop?

1:13:51.461 --> 1:13:55.810
Good work, soldier.
Mission accomplished.

1:13:56.604 --> 1:13:59.607
This is the good stuff.

1:13:59.642 --> 1:14:01.091
Pure as it gets.

1:14:01.126 --> 1:14:05.130
And straight up.
Just like God intended.

1:14:05.682 --> 1:14:09.341
Mmm. Goes down smooth as you
like.

1:14:09.997 --> 1:14:13.000
I'm not gonna toast myself.

1:14:20.145 --> 1:14:24.321
Once you get past the burn,
you and bourbon will be fast
friends.

1:14:25.322 --> 1:14:27.117
This was a test?

1:14:27.152 --> 1:14:30.017
And you passed. With flying
colors.

1:14:30.051 --> 1:14:33.020
- Keep this up and you'll earn
a promotion.
- To what?

1:14:33.054 --> 1:14:35.505
- How's staff sergeant sound?
- Pointless.

1:14:35.540 --> 1:14:37.473
- We don't have a staff.
- Not yet.

1:14:37.507 --> 1:14:41.166
- And corporal comes after
private.
- Well, that's in peacetime.

1:14:41.200 --> 1:14:43.858
We're a nation at war.

1:14:49.554 --> 1:14:53.212
Wow, easy soldier.
You got patrol duty tonight.

1:14:53.247 --> 1:14:54.628
- I'm done.
- I can see that.

1:14:54.662 --> 1:14:57.631
No, with you and your
bullshit.
Hey, watch what you say next.

1:14:57.665 --> 1:15:01.704
- Why? Nothing matters to you,
right?
- This bomb's a fucking fake,
just like you.

1:15:01.738 --> 1:15:03.878
- Stand down, soldier.
- I'm not your soldier,

1:15:03.913 --> 1:15:05.984
and you're not my Admiral.

1:15:06.018 --> 1:15:08.504
You can't leave.

1:15:09.021 --> 1:15:11.437
You can't stop me.

1:15:12.024 --> 1:15:14.510
I can out run you.

1:15:14.544 --> 1:15:15.994
Out fight you.

1:15:16.028 --> 1:15:18.652
- Out shoot you.
- You didn't say outsmart.

1:15:18.686 --> 1:15:21.827
- It won't come to that.
- Kyle. Thank God you're all
right.

1:15:21.862 --> 1:15:23.657
Why wouldn't he be?
Did you send him out there

1:15:23.691 --> 1:15:26.383
to blow up Raymond's pump?
Don't worry, he didn't do it.

1:15:26.418 --> 1:15:27.902
- Cuz you gave me a fucking toy!
- Honey!

1:15:27.937 --> 1:15:30.353
Do not speak to your
commanding officer
with that tone of voice,

1:15:30.387 --> 1:15:33.425
with that disrespect.
- You don't deserve my respect.

1:15:33.459 --> 1:15:36.842
Oh, listen to that mouth.
Your Marines would have you
eating boot

1:15:36.877 --> 1:15:39.017
soon as you got off the bus.
- What do you know about the
Marines?

1:15:39.051 --> 1:15:41.019
I served.
In the Merchant Marines
because you

1:15:41.053 --> 1:15:44.540
didn't have the gut for war.
[bitter laugh]

1:15:54.066 --> 1:15:55.689
Did you do that to her?

1:15:55.723 --> 1:15:59.037
- She did it to herself.
- You fucking coward.

1:15:59.071 --> 1:16:01.557
Savannah, we should go.

1:16:01.591 --> 1:16:04.042
No, no. You should stay.

1:16:04.076 --> 1:16:07.390
Yeah, I want everybody
to hear this treason.

1:16:07.424 --> 1:16:09.772
So you wanna join the Marines,
prove what a big man you are?

1:16:09.806 --> 1:16:13.120
I'm not proving anything.
I want to fight. Actually
shoot people,

1:16:13.154 --> 1:16:14.949
not play in the backyard.
Oh, yeah?

1:16:14.984 --> 1:16:18.884
You wanna fight? Then why don't
we just square off right now?

1:16:18.919 --> 1:16:20.748
- Grant.
- No, no this is good.

1:16:20.783 --> 1:16:24.476
- You want a piece of your old
man?
- Hit him, Kyle.

1:16:24.510 --> 1:16:26.236
- Pop me, son.
- Stop it, both of you.

1:16:26.271 --> 1:16:29.619
No, this is between me and
the boy. I'm a man, goddamn
it. I'm not your boy.

1:16:29.654 --> 1:16:32.484
- You're my boy for the next sixmonths.
- Says who, the
Americans?

1:16:32.518 --> 1:16:36.074
- Their laws mean nothing to
you, right?
- What does that
mean?

1:16:36.108 --> 1:16:39.077
You're still playing by
their rules,
living in their world.

1:16:39.111 --> 1:16:42.736
Call yourself whatever
you'd like, but you're not
special.

1:16:42.770 --> 1:16:45.635
You're another stupid American.

1:16:45.670 --> 1:16:46.636
I...

1:16:46.671 --> 1:16:49.156
am the Admiral of Kallipoly!

1:16:49.190 --> 1:16:52.469
You're a dipshit playing
dressup.

1:16:55.818 --> 1:16:58.027
Whoa.

1:16:59.062 --> 1:17:03.480
I didn't mean that.
You know, you surprised me.

1:17:11.040 --> 1:17:12.282
Okay.

1:17:12.317 --> 1:17:16.632
A shot for a shot. We're
square.

1:17:19.013 --> 1:17:21.464
- Kyle, that's your father.
- I know.

1:17:21.498 --> 1:17:24.778
- Mom, go pack the car now.
- I need, he needs me.

1:17:24.812 --> 1:17:25.986
We're leaving tonight.

1:17:26.020 --> 1:17:27.988
- Don't hurt him any more.
- I won't if he stays down.

1:17:28.022 --> 1:17:30.473
-Kyle, you're coming with us.
- Where are you going?

1:17:30.507 --> 1:17:31.992
- Aunt Carol's.
- The hell you are!

1:17:32.026 --> 1:17:36.030
- Mom, pack the car now. Please.
- Go on.

1:17:43.037 --> 1:17:44.556
What are you doing?

1:17:44.590 --> 1:17:48.008
Completing the mission.
Is that...

1:17:48.042 --> 1:17:50.044
Kyle that's real dynamite.

1:17:50.079 --> 1:17:53.979
You can't do this.
It's pointless, it's all
bullshit.

1:17:54.014 --> 1:17:55.394
So you said.

1:17:55.429 --> 1:17:57.983
You're going to risk
everything for
a plan that never made sense.

1:17:58.018 --> 1:17:59.813
What are you going to
accomplish out there?

1:17:59.847 --> 1:18:02.505
Something.
I'm going to actually do
something.

1:18:02.539 --> 1:18:05.508
- I have to defend our nation.
- I thought you were done with
him.

1:18:05.542 --> 1:18:07.510
I am. But this asshole's
too weak to lift a finger

1:18:07.544 --> 1:18:10.513
and we have barbarians at the
gate.
- Well, what about the Marines?

1:18:10.547 --> 1:18:13.067
They won't take you if you're
arrested
for domestic terrorism.

1:18:13.102 --> 1:18:17.209
- That's crazy. Do I look like
a terrorist?
- Yes!

1:18:19.039 --> 1:18:21.282
Kyle.

1:18:21.731 --> 1:18:25.045
Please don't do this.

1:18:25.873 --> 1:18:28.186
I have to.
This is who I am.

1:18:28.220 --> 1:18:32.017
I know Dad's a fucking moron,
but not everything he said was
wrong.

1:18:32.052 --> 1:18:34.019
All we need is a few tweaks
to the constitution and

1:18:34.054 --> 1:18:36.021
a new leader with a vision.
- And that's you?

1:18:36.056 --> 1:18:40.025
Why not? You could be my
