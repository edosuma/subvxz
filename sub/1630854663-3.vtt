(foreboding music)

00:25.960 --> 00:29.040
(birds chirping)

00:37.360 --> 00:42.120
("Numb" by Portishead playing)

01:17.720 --> 01:20.960
("Numb" playing
from small speaker)

01:28.480 --> 01:30.560
That's a serious allegation.

01:32.120 --> 01:36.960
Yeah, okay, yep.
We'll look into it. Thank you.

01:38.360 --> 01:41.540
Owner of the newsagent. Thinks
Joe Baker is the killer.

01:41.640 --> 01:44.580
Didn't actually live in
Ashford in 1994,

01:44.680 --> 01:46.980
but her hairdresser saw Joe
yelling at Isabel

01:47.080 --> 01:48.100
at a hockey game once.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.740
Right. Case closed then.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.100
That's the 10th call
like that this week.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.020
What's that?

01:53.120 --> 01:55.560
It is Isabel's movements
the night of...

01:58.680 --> 02:01.460
Isabel and Chloe were walking
home from the formal,

02:01.560 --> 02:05.260
and they parted ways at the
T intersection at 12.30am.

02:05.360 --> 02:08.280
That was the last
known sighting of Izzy.

02:11.160 --> 02:15.260
Now, the distance between T
intersection and the Baker house

02:15.360 --> 02:16.260
is two k's.

02:16.360 --> 02:17.820
Well the boss thinks the
guy in the blue car

02:17.920 --> 02:19.540
must have picked her up
in those two k's.

02:19.640 --> 02:24.780
Yeah! But why dump the body all
the way the other side of town?

02:24.880 --> 02:27.080
Here!

02:27.400 --> 02:29.100
There's all this
bushland along here

02:29.200 --> 02:31.240
where he could have
dumped the body.

02:31.760 --> 02:35.260
But yet, he drove five k's away

02:35.360 --> 02:37.540
and dumped her body
at the cemetery.

02:37.640 --> 02:40.240
In plain sight, I might add.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.460
Does that make sense to you?

02:42.560 --> 02:44.560
No, sir.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.760
It doesn't make sense.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.400
(theme music)

03:04.040 --> 03:07.200
(percussive flourish)

03:08.320 --> 03:10.320
Her drawings are beautiful.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.380
Thank you, Mrs. Baker.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.980
I'll make sure these
are returned to you.

03:17.080 --> 03:19.080
Thanks.

03:19.840 --> 03:23.220
So uh, how does this help?

03:23.320 --> 03:26.180
It's important I
get to know Isabel.

03:26.280 --> 03:27.620
You know, a lot of
time has passed,

03:27.720 --> 03:31.060
people's memories,
they can be deceptive.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.320
They fade, some people lie.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.760
But this, Isabel,
she won't lie.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.600
You've felt pain like ours.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.640
I can see it in your eyes.

03:49.080 --> 03:53.460
Um, did Isabel say anything

03:53.560 --> 03:57.340
about a formal after-party,
or did she mention at all

03:57.440 --> 03:59.140
that she was going to
meet someone that night?

03:59.240 --> 04:01.020
No, she was coming
straight home.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.460
And you were at work
that night, right?

04:02.560 --> 04:03.420
The night shift?

04:03.520 --> 04:05.340
And your husband was at home?

04:05.440 --> 04:06.260
That's correct?

04:06.360 --> 04:08.460
Yeah, that's all on
their original statements.

04:08.560 --> 04:09.260
Yeah, I know.

04:09.360 --> 04:10.940
That's where I'm getting
the information from.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.040
Just making sure it's accurate.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.220
Well, I really appreciate this

04:16.320 --> 04:20.300
and I think it's, um,
it's really going to help.

04:20.400 --> 04:22.400
Thank you.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.500

04:31.600 --> 04:33.340

04:33.440 --> 04:35.220
Please leave a message. (beep)

04:35.320 --> 04:36.220
Hey, boss lady.

04:36.320 --> 04:37.060
Just seeing how you went

04:37.160 --> 04:39.700
chasing down the owner
of that blue car.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.800
Give me a call back.

04:47.480 --> 04:50.160

[Hector Voiceover] Dear 2019,
my name is Hector Ford.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.420
In 1994, my life
is just beginning

05:27.520 --> 05:29.540
because I'm about
to leave Ashford

05:29.640 --> 05:31.900
and everyone in it behind me.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.640
The cool kids will die in this
shithole, but I'll escape.

05:42.400 --> 05:45.300
We can talk inside
if you prefer.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.400
Here's fine.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.540
Babe, this is
Detective Cormack.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.640
Hey, hey.

05:55.680 --> 05:56.700
Mind if I keep going?

05:56.800 --> 05:58.800
No, please.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.960
Shit, sorry.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.280
Thank you.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.840
(brush whooshing)

06:11.840 --> 06:13.840
What was Izzy like?

06:15.280 --> 06:17.760
She was beautiful,
smart, funny.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.980
I'm sure everyone's
told you that.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.140
Even those that
were shit to her

06:22.240 --> 06:24.380
suddenly loved her
when she was gone.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.780
Anyone in particular?

06:25.880 --> 06:27.580
(chuckling) I didn't
mean it like that.

06:27.680 --> 06:28.420
It was high school.

06:28.520 --> 06:29.580
Everyone was two-faced.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.700
Sounds like you had a
tough time in high school.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.140
Small town, small minds.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.240
Mm.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.860
It's been suggested

06:39.960 --> 06:43.420
that you had some unusual
interests at school;

06:43.520 --> 06:46.500
that you might have been
fascinated by the occult.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.300
(scoffing) I went
through a Goth phase

06:48.400 --> 06:49.980
after I watched "The Crow."

06:50.080 --> 06:52.540
I wasn't Marilyn Manson;
I was lonely.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.640
You found a friend
in Isabel, huh?

06:55.520 --> 06:58.820
We moved in different orbits,
but we did the time capsule.

06:58.920 --> 07:00.920
We just clicked.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.840
What do you think
happened to her?

07:09.280 --> 07:11.220
I dunno.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.740
I spent the last 25 years
trying not to think about it

07:13.840 --> 07:15.840
so I could remember
her as she was.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.740
Now unfortunately,
the police back in '94

07:19.840 --> 07:21.180
didn't interview you.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.980
So there's no record
of where you were

07:23.080 --> 07:25.140
the night of the formal.

07:25.240 --> 07:27.100
At the formal.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.580
After that.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.380
I went home.

07:30.480 --> 07:32.480
Yeah, can anybody
confirm that?

07:33.840 --> 07:35.460
No.

07:35.560 --> 07:37.300
My parents were away.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.400
They travel a lot.

07:41.400 --> 07:42.380
Why?

07:42.480 --> 07:45.200
You left town two days
after Isabel was killed.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.760
Why'd you do that?

07:50.480 --> 07:52.260
Moved to Sydney for uni.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.620
But uni doesn't
start until February.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.920
You didn't want to stick
around for her funeral?

07:59.840 --> 08:01.840
People grieve differently.

08:08.800 --> 08:09.540
I don't want to be rude,

08:09.640 --> 08:12.320
but got a lot of work
to get through here.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.420
Okay, I'll let you
get back to it.

08:15.520 --> 08:16.340
Thanks.

08:16.440 --> 08:17.380
Thanks for your time, mate.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.420
Yeah.

08:19.520 --> 08:22.000
(eerie music)

08:31.480 --> 08:32.740
(bag slamming)

08:32.840 --> 08:34.840
This town is toxic.

08:35.800 --> 08:36.540
What happened?

08:36.640 --> 08:38.640
I heard some woman
at the shops.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.840
She said Pop
killed Aunty Izzy.

08:44.040 --> 08:46.040
Oh, bub.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.880
Come here.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.360
What's wrong with people?

09:00.560 --> 09:02.560
Let's get out of the
house for a bit, eh?

09:03.880 --> 09:05.880
Feel the water on our feet.

09:08.040 --> 09:12.280
(woman singing
in native language)

09:13.880 --> 09:16.520
(reel clicking)

09:18.320 --> 09:21.080
(waves crashing)

09:28.680 --> 09:32.160
(woman continues singing)

09:40.360 --> 09:43.440
(mobile phone chiming)

09:46.640 --> 09:49.320
(ominous music)

09:51.760 --> 09:54.320
(bird calling)

10:00.800 --> 10:04.420
Sarge, physical evidence arrived
from the EMF in Brisbane.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.080
(tape tearing)

10:10.360 --> 10:13.200
(papers rustling)

10:19.040 --> 10:21.380
(ominous music)

10:21.480 --> 10:24.920
(Dale breathing heavily)

10:29.040 --> 10:33.440
Try to focus on the girl
who was wearing the dress,

10:34.800 --> 10:37.140
on who she was when
she was alive.

10:37.240 --> 10:38.420
Doesn't that just
make it harder?

10:38.520 --> 10:40.520
No.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.440
What is it?

10:51.120 --> 10:53.500
I don't remember
any red soil like this

10:53.600 --> 10:56.060
at any of the known
locations from that night.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.940
Looks like she
was crawling in it.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.040
Trying to get away?

11:01.120 --> 11:03.120
Maybe.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.480
Where's her necklace?

11:11.200 --> 11:14.980
She wore a bird necklace
at the formal that night.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.940
See, it's in all the photos.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.420
Maybe it came loose
during the struggle

11:18.520 --> 11:20.520
when she was killed.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.200
That's a possibility.

11:25.640 --> 11:28.940
Or the other one is
that the killer took it

11:29.040 --> 11:31.280
just like he took her hair.

11:33.400 --> 11:36.620
(rooster crowing)

11:36.720 --> 11:38.720
That is lush.

11:39.280 --> 11:41.220
I don't know, it kind of
clashes with my necklace.

11:41.320 --> 11:42.020
So what?

11:42.120 --> 11:42.880
Just don't wear the necklace.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.060
Are you even still
going with Anton?

11:45.160 --> 11:46.020
Yeah, we just had a fight.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.340
Uh-uh.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.180
Oh, I love your necklace.

11:48.280 --> 11:49.740
Even if you break up with him

11:49.840 --> 11:52.720
you should still wear it to
the formal just to rub it in.

11:54.680 --> 11:57.440
(girls laughing)

11:59.200 --> 12:02.140
Hey, I got us a present.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.240
Check this out.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.620
Tada!

12:11.720 --> 12:12.460
That's pretty cool.

12:12.560 --> 12:13.500
They're our road
trip uniforms.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.700
But shouldn't we
be saving our money

12:14.800 --> 12:17.740
for more essential
things like food?

12:17.840 --> 12:18.800
Don't worry, you don't
have to pay me back.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.860
My Dad bought them.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.220
Mum's home.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.100
Thanks.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.340
You want some
Yum Yum tart?

12:24.440 --> 12:26.440
Is that even a question?

12:31.120 --> 12:33.200
Hey, Iz, I need to show
you this video.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.740
(bell dinging)

12:37.840 --> 12:38.540
I don't get it.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.500
Hang on, it's coming.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.700
(man) Sorry.

12:41.800 --> 12:45.120
(man speaking in video)

12:52.480 --> 12:54.480
Hector!

12:57.160 --> 12:57.860
Is that it?

12:57.960 --> 12:59.340
That is so sus.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.300
He runs the place.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.340
There's heaps of reasons why
he could be talking to her.

13:02.440 --> 13:03.660
I don't think he
was there to talk.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.580
Seriously?

13:05.680 --> 13:06.660
It's Chloe's dad.

13:06.760 --> 13:07.460
I've known him forever.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.560
I reckon he's sus.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.300
(watch beeping)

13:12.400 --> 13:14.400
Shit, I've got
to go to work.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.860
Do you want some company?

13:16.960 --> 13:19.860
(birds singing)

13:19.960 --> 13:22.880
(register beeping)

13:25.920 --> 13:28.300
"Priscilla," that looks so gay.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.860
I think it's great.

13:29.960 --> 13:32.800
The dresses in it
are really cool.

13:36.360 --> 13:38.180
Is that Mr. Ludlow
from woodwork?

13:38.280 --> 13:39.020
Yep.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.500
What did he rent?

13:40.600 --> 13:41.940
"Basic Instinct."

13:42.040 --> 13:43.580
(car starting)

13:43.680 --> 13:44.700
Oh gross!

13:44.800 --> 13:46.540
It's the third time
he's rented it.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.380
Seriously?

13:47.480 --> 13:48.220
This week.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.920
(both laughing)

13:55.080 --> 13:57.600
(man talking)

14:01.160 --> 14:04.720
(car starting and revving)

14:06.320 --> 14:09.480
(children chattering)

14:14.680 --> 14:16.680
Hey.

14:17.600 --> 14:18.820
What's that?

14:18.920 --> 14:21.980
Just the shit Mrs. Walker
wanted for the time capsule

14:22.080 --> 14:24.080
for the SES.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.460
Why haven't you been at school?

14:27.560 --> 14:28.780
Because Dad's been
a bit shorthanded.

14:28.880 --> 14:31.160
I've been helping him
with the harvest and stuff.

14:33.520 --> 14:35.520
So where were you on Sunday?

14:36.480 --> 14:39.100
I must have been waiting
for like an hour.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.580
I'm sorry,
I couldn't get away.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.680
Mum needed my help after church.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.120
That's bullshit.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.060
I mean, Tasha
was working at the Servo

14:51.160 --> 14:52.260
and she saw you ride past,

14:52.360 --> 14:55.020
so who gave you the
better offer this time?

14:55.120 --> 14:56.820
Was it Mick or Hector,
'cause honestly, Izzy,

14:56.920 --> 14:58.140
I just can't keep track.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.480
You're the one that hangs
out with Tasha all the time.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.560
That's 'cause
she wants to hang out.

15:02.600 --> 15:03.340
Wait, where were you?

15:03.440 --> 15:05.440
I don't have to
tell you everything.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.800
Whatever.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.060
What's up with you?

15:17.160 --> 15:17.900
Nothing.

15:18.000 --> 15:18.940
Trouble in paradise?

15:19.040 --> 15:19.920
You don't know
the half of it.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.240
(Anton and Tasha
continue talking)

15:30.280 --> 15:33.040
(pages rustling)

15:39.480 --> 15:42.120
(ominous music)

15:51.840 --> 15:54.760
(percussive music)

16:02.800 --> 16:03.540
Creepy.

16:03.640 --> 16:04.540
Sorry.

16:04.640 --> 16:05.620
What is it?

16:05.720 --> 16:10.100
Some kind of pagan grim
reaper, death shepherd.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.980
What are you turning
into a Goth now

16:12.080 --> 16:13.380
'cause you're
hanging out with Hector?

16:13.480 --> 16:15.140
Very funny.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.240
Uh, Mum's leaving
if you want a lift.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.740
Do you have an army
disposal store or something?

16:29.840 --> 16:31.740
(Chloe laughing)

16:31.840 --> 16:32.580
Cool, hey?

16:32.680 --> 16:33.580
What even is that?

16:33.680 --> 16:35.660
It's a torch

16:35.760 --> 16:38.940
in case we need a piss in
the bush at night. (laughing)

16:39.040 --> 16:40.460
That does sound handy.

16:40.560 --> 16:42.560
Yeah.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.380
Who's that?

16:46.480 --> 16:48.480
Um, I'm not sure.

16:49.360 --> 16:50.780
Sometimes if the
pickers lose work

16:50.880 --> 16:52.940
Dad get them odd jobs here
and there to help them out.

16:53.040 --> 16:53.820
That's nice of him.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.100
Mm.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.200
She's pretty

16:59.680 --> 17:01.700
I guess.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.380
Anyway,
what do you reckon?

17:04.480 --> 17:06.260
I think we're
pretty much sorted.

17:06.360 --> 17:07.500
Looks like it.

17:07.600 --> 17:09.600
Except for telling
your parents.

17:11.720 --> 17:14.280
(bird singing)

17:20.000 --> 17:22.800
(tires crunching)

17:25.360 --> 17:26.820
What happened?

17:26.920 --> 17:28.920
I'm sorry, Iz.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.560
(Joe) Isabel!

17:37.640 --> 17:40.040
(door thuds)

17:44.920 --> 17:45.820
Did you go through my room?

17:45.920 --> 17:47.220
I found your sister reading it.

17:47.320 --> 17:48.540
She shouldn't be in my stuff.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.660
This book is full of sin.

17:51.760 --> 17:52.460
The enemy led you to it-

17:52.560 --> 17:53.580
You haven't even read it.

17:53.680 --> 17:54.440
You don't know
what I'm thinking.

17:54.520 --> 17:55.260
Don't own my mind.

17:55.360 --> 17:58.500
(chair thudding)

17:58.600 --> 18:02.840
While you're in my
house, you obey my rules!

18:07.960 --> 18:11.600
(Isabel breathing raggedly)

18:16.360 --> 18:17.940
It's not your fault.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.640
(sombre music)

18:22.720 --> 18:23.655
(birds singing)

18:23.665 --> 18:24.560
(birds singing)

18:27.480 --> 18:28.115
(car humming)

18:28.125 --> 18:28.800
(car purring)

18:34.120 --> 18:36.120
I need to show
you something.

18:39.800 --> 18:44.140
When Izzy was murdered,
we were the victims.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.680
Yet somehow we were the
ones under questioning.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.300
Why was Izzy
dressed so pretty?

18:49.400 --> 18:51.220
(cane rustling)

18:51.320 --> 18:53.320
Was she drunk?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.800
Why didn't her parents
pick her up?

18:58.080 --> 18:59.460
Do you know what
that feels like?

18:59.560 --> 19:01.560
Yeah.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.880
I do.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.780
You know, apart from
the swish coffee,

19:05.880 --> 19:07.580
things have barely changed
at this petrol stop

19:07.680 --> 19:09.860
since I was a kid.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.820
Ashford hasn't changed
much either.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.100
You know,
the gossip around town

19:13.200 --> 19:15.420
is that Izzy didn't get
into the car that night;

19:15.520 --> 19:17.460
she came home
and Dad killed her.

19:17.560 --> 19:21.120
Luckily, I don't deal in
gossip, just the truth.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.780
Can I trust you to do
right by my family?

19:24.880 --> 19:27.280
You can trust me to
do right by Isabel.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.880
I know Izzy didn't
come home that night.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.480
The one thing that has
changed around here:

19:41.120 --> 19:43.120
the phone box is gone.

19:43.760 --> 19:46.840
(percussive strikes)

19:49.320 --> 19:51.320
I was asleep on the
couch when she rang.

19:53.160 --> 19:56.780
I got up, turned the TV off,
and went into the kitchen.

19:56.880 --> 20:01.880
Mum was at work and Dad
was asleep, so I picked up.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.740
Izzy asked me to get Dad,
but I wouldn't

20:05.840 --> 20:07.840
'cause I wanted to
know where she was.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.200
She said that she
was out here.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.960
Then I heard a car pull up,

20:15.400 --> 20:18.820
and this song was playing,
and Izzy went quiet.

20:18.920 --> 20:20.780
(rock music)

20:20.880 --> 20:22.900
I asked her if she
still needed Dad,

20:23.000 --> 20:25.800
if she still needed
a lift, and she,

20:27.600 --> 20:30.840
she didn't answer me, so I
thought that she was drunk.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.840
I thought that
she was partying.

20:37.560 --> 20:40.980
I got angry with her and
I told her to walk home.

20:41.080 --> 20:43.980
(eerie music)

20:44.080 --> 20:45.980
And then I hung up.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.660
(metal creaking)
(rock music)

20:48.760 --> 20:50.760
Izzy didn't want a
lift that night.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.660
She needed help.

20:54.760 --> 20:58.520
(intense note reverberating)

21:03.800 --> 21:07.120
(eerie music continues)

21:12.080 --> 21:14.080
Thank you for telling me that.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.980
I'm going to step outside
for a minute, okay?

21:18.080 --> 21:20.080
'Kay.

21:20.560 --> 21:23.480
(insects trilling)

21:30.720 --> 21:33.480
(car door thuds)

21:38.960 --> 21:41.600
(shoe scraping)

21:49.320 --> 21:52.080
(car door thuds)

21:56.000 --> 21:57.940
Can you remember
what time it was?

21:58.040 --> 22:00.540
After midnight. (sniffs)

22:00.640 --> 22:02.620
Around 12:30.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.640
Look, I know I should have
said something a long time ago.

22:07.280 --> 22:09.280
Hey, you were just a kid.

22:14.280 --> 22:17.460
To be honest, before the letter,

22:17.560 --> 22:18.500
I don't think the information

22:18.600 --> 22:21.300
would've made much of
a difference to Turner.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.400
And now?

22:23.880 --> 22:26.040
Well, it changes the timeline.

22:27.720 --> 22:29.720
Knowing where she was, it, uh,

22:30.600 --> 22:32.840
it's a pretty important
piece of the puzzle.

22:36.240 --> 22:38.460
What was she
doing out here?

22:38.560 --> 22:41.660
I mean, there's
nothing out here.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.360
(sombre music)

22:47.120 --> 22:49.800
(wind rustling)

22:56.360 --> 22:58.860
(Turner) What's that all about?

22:58.960 --> 23:01.940
That is Isabel's
last known location

23:02.040 --> 23:03.660
the night of the murder.

23:03.760 --> 23:05.760
According to who?

23:06.600 --> 23:07.660
A credible witness.

23:07.760 --> 23:10.340
Yeah, I seriously doubt
they're more credible

23:10.440 --> 23:14.060
than Chloe Walcott, who was
walking home with Isabel

23:14.160 --> 23:18.840
at the same time your 'CI'
puts her at the servo.

23:19.760 --> 23:21.380
Might be worth asking
if your witness

23:21.480 --> 23:24.500
who's just magically
remembered this vital info

23:24.600 --> 23:26.640
has a reason to lie.

23:34.960 --> 23:37.600
(birds singing)

23:44.720 --> 23:47.120
(door opens)

23:48.520 --> 23:50.520
Hey, hello, love.

23:52.200 --> 23:54.300
We don't see you
in here very often.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.400
Everything okay?

23:58.800 --> 24:01.120
I need to ask you about
the night Izzy died.

24:05.040 --> 24:08.120
You carried this alone
all them years.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.800
Why didn't you tell me?

24:14.640 --> 24:16.640
Guilt.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.680
And fear.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.920
About asking where
you were that night.

24:30.280 --> 24:33.420
After I hung up,
when I passed your room,

24:33.520 --> 24:35.640
the door was open
and it was empty.

24:40.640 --> 24:42.640
Where were you, Dad?

24:45.920 --> 24:47.920
Look, I'm not saying...

24:49.560 --> 24:51.720
I just need to know
so I can protect you.

24:54.920 --> 24:58.960
I was here helping a
parishioner in need.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.020
Thank God.

25:03.120 --> 25:05.300
You've got an alibi.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.220
Who were you with?

25:07.320 --> 25:08.740
I can't tell you that.

25:08.840 --> 25:12.980
They came to me
to confess a sin.

25:13.080 --> 25:18.100
Dad, this is more
important than that.

25:18.200 --> 25:21.140
If Turner finds out that
you don't have an alibi...

25:21.240 --> 25:27.520
I don't fear Sergeant Turner's
judgement, or any man's.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.900
Savages.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.020
Is nothing sacred anymore?

25:34.120 --> 25:35.660
What does it even mean?

25:35.760 --> 25:36.820
It's blackbirding.

25:36.920 --> 25:37.700
Eh?

25:37.800 --> 25:39.100
62,000 islanders
were brought in

25:39.200 --> 25:40.820
to work on the cane
back in the day.

25:40.920 --> 25:43.300
You studying to
go on "Millionaire"?

25:43.400 --> 25:44.460
No, I Googled James Ashford

25:44.560 --> 25:47.140
after Kalana tagged
the statue last time.

25:47.240 --> 25:49.740
Never knew we had
slavery in Australia.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.340
Yeah, well you can save
your virtue signalling

25:51.440 --> 25:53.100
for your boyfriend
from the city.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.220
That's nice.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.320
Yeah, clean that shit up.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.460
Kalana!

25:59.560 --> 26:04.340
(players shouting)
(whistle trilling)

26:04.440 --> 26:05.660
Hey, what's up?

26:05.760 --> 26:07.460
That statue was
vandalised again.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.060
Great.

26:09.160 --> 26:11.260
I didn't do it.

26:11.360 --> 26:12.380
I'm glad someone
did, though.

26:12.480 --> 26:13.820
Go get your things;
we're going home.

26:13.920 --> 26:14.780
I have to train.

26:14.880 --> 26:16.880
Is everything all right?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.180
Sorry coach, I got to go.

26:20.280 --> 26:20.980
Coach?

26:21.080 --> 26:22.140
Yeah, Leo's back's playing up,

26:22.240 --> 26:24.240
so I offered to
fill in for a bit.

26:25.320 --> 26:28.760
Hey, um, is there any
way that Kal can stay?

26:30.000 --> 26:31.700
It's just,
I'm still getting up to speed

26:31.800 --> 26:34.120
and she's the captain.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.480
She's a natural leader.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.140
I'll drop her home
if that helps.

26:40.240 --> 26:42.220
That won't be necessary.

26:42.320 --> 26:43.940
Front gate, 6:01.

26:44.040 --> 26:45.420
Hurry up.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.600
(players chattering)

26:50.400 --> 26:52.400
Thanks for that.

26:55.320 --> 26:57.340
How you doing?

26:57.440 --> 26:59.440
How do you think I'm doing?

26:59.880 --> 27:01.940
Yeah, yeah.

27:02.040 --> 27:04.040
Sorry.

27:05.760 --> 27:07.760
You look like shit.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.600
Yeah.

27:13.280 --> 27:15.280
I better get back to it.

27:20.920 --> 27:22.920
Pair up again.

27:24.600 --> 27:28.620
(Tasha Voiceover) Dear 2019,
my name is Tasha Hopkins.

27:28.720 --> 27:33.020
In 2019 I predict Ashford
will be pretty much the same.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.120
Fuck all ever changes
around here.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.300
Were you surprised
by Isabel's letter at all?

27:39.400 --> 27:41.400
No.

27:42.040 --> 27:44.660
She always did like to be
the centre of attention.

27:44.760 --> 27:47.400
Hmm, I heard she was
pretty level-headed.

27:49.640 --> 27:51.800
Yeah, well, she's a saint now,
isn't she?

27:52.960 --> 27:55.060
Saint Fucking Isabel.

27:55.160 --> 27:58.040
You obviously miss her a lot.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.820
Don't get me wrong.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.920
It sucks she died.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.640
But it was a lifetime ago.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.440
You and her had a
little friction, huh?

28:13.440 --> 28:15.300
Over Anton?

28:15.400 --> 28:16.460
It's pretty simple, really.

28:16.560 --> 28:19.100
I was in love with him,
he was in love with her.

28:19.200 --> 28:22.460
She broke up with him the
night of the formal.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.020
You know why?

28:24.120 --> 28:26.540
I assumed it was 'cause of
the other guy she was seeing,

28:26.640 --> 28:28.640
the older bloke.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.100
Do you know who
this older bloke was?

28:34.200 --> 28:36.180
No.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.820
My brother saw her
with him a few times,

28:37.920 --> 28:42.740
but all I know he was
older and he was black.

28:42.840 --> 28:45.180
Why didn't you tell the
police this back in '94?

28:45.280 --> 28:47.280
Didn't ask.

28:47.800 --> 28:50.100
Only asked me if I spent
the night with Anton.

28:50.200 --> 28:52.200
And you did, right?

28:52.800 --> 28:54.740
The whole night?

28:54.840 --> 28:57.600
Yep. (blowing smoke)

29:03.000 --> 29:04.540
My shift's about to start.

29:04.640 --> 29:05.740
One last thing.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.700
Do you know what Isabel meant

29:07.800 --> 29:10.300
when she said she'd
seen The Ankou?

29:10.400 --> 29:11.900
No.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.160
It's probably some god
botherer bullshit.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.380
I really do have to work.

29:17.480 --> 29:19.020
I know.

29:19.120 --> 29:21.880
(birds tweeting)

29:29.640 --> 29:32.900
(footsteps scraping)

29:33.000 --> 29:35.520
(eerie music)

29:36.960 --> 29:39.700
(leaves rustling)

29:39.800 --> 29:41.500
I was on my morning jog.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.240
Came up through there,
through the cane.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.680
She was laying there.

29:50.600 --> 29:52.600
Did you reposition
her body at all?

29:53.760 --> 29:55.460
No.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.560
I checked her pulse.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.460
But I knew she was
already gone from us.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.460
What about the flowers?

30:03.560 --> 30:04.900
Did you put them on her?

30:05.000 --> 30:05.940
Nah.

30:06.040 --> 30:08.100
He must have done that.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.340
Twisted fuck.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.180
You two dated
for a while, huh?

30:12.280 --> 30:15.200
We didn't call it that,
but yeah.

30:16.400 --> 30:19.380
Vince said that Isabel
was dating an older fella

30:19.480 --> 30:21.480
at the time of her death.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.140
You two didn't get
back together, did you?

30:24.240 --> 30:26.340
No.

30:26.440 --> 30:29.420
I loved Izzy, but she
was more like a sister.

30:29.520 --> 30:30.940
What about her father?

30:31.040 --> 30:33.040
I heard he's pretty strict.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.180
How you reckon he
would've reacted

30:35.280 --> 30:37.960
if he found out she was going
out with an older fella?

30:40.680 --> 30:43.060
You want to know what Joe
thinks about something,

30:43.160 --> 30:45.160
you ask him.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.720
Yeah.

30:51.720 --> 30:54.800
(mobile phone chiming)

30:56.680 --> 30:57.420
Hey, boss.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.340
How's it
going up there?

30:59.440 --> 31:01.440
Yeah, making progress.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.220
Bloody hot, though.

31:04.320 --> 31:05.700
That's probably
just the menopause.

31:05.800 --> 31:06.900
(James chuckling)

31:07.000 --> 31:09.360
Hey, your father's been
trying to reach you.

31:14.680 --> 31:15.740
Called you, did he?

31:15.840 --> 31:16.700
No.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.180
Someone from homicide
dropped a message off.

31:19.280 --> 31:22.080
Said your dad needs you to
come and see him urgently.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Is everything all right, James?

31:27.520 --> 31:29.520
Yeah, I'm fine.

31:30.040 --> 31:30.780
All good.

31:30.880 --> 31:31.700
All right, thanks.

31:31.800 --> 31:33.800
Cheers.

31:34.760 --> 31:37.520
(bird squawking)

31:41.440 --> 31:44.200
(James exhaling)

31:49.840 --> 31:50.580
(door slamming)

31:50.680 --> 31:52.680
Fuck!

31:54.240 --> 31:56.260
You want to call now, huh?

31:56.360 --> 31:57.660
You want to talk to me?

31:57.760 --> 31:59.580
(James breathing heavily)

31:59.680 --> 32:02.680
(metallic clanking)

32:05.320 --> 32:08.240
(lighter clicking)

32:15.880 --> 32:16.980
(skin sizzling)

32:17.080 --> 32:19.800
(James groaning)

32:25.920 --> 32:29.160
(James breathing hard)

32:35.160 --> 32:36.380
Need any help
with them carrots?

32:36.480 --> 32:38.020
No, you're good
with the beans.

32:38.120 --> 32:41.200
(mobile phone chiming)

32:43.120 --> 32:43.940
Hey.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.740
I've got a question.

32:45.840 --> 32:46.620
Go ahead.

32:46.720 --> 32:49.820
Was your sister dating
anyone else other than Anton?

32:49.920 --> 32:51.220
Possibly an older guy?

32:51.320 --> 32:53.180
Possibly from the community.

32:53.280 --> 32:54.060
Are you serious?

32:54.160 --> 32:55.500
I was told that she was.

32:55.600 --> 32:56.540
By who?

32:56.640 --> 32:58.640
It doesn't matter who.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.440
I can't believe you.

33:02.400 --> 33:03.900
You're slut-shaming
my dead sister.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.140
I'm not judging your sister,

33:05.240 --> 33:06.460
I'm just asking a question.

33:06.560 --> 33:08.560
Yeah well, it's a shit question.

33:10.080 --> 33:12.100
I thought you said you
didn't listen to gossip.

33:12.200 --> 33:15.580
(dial tone beeping)

33:15.680 --> 33:17.680
What's got you so filthy?

33:18.760 --> 33:20.340
Bloody cops.

33:20.440 --> 33:21.420
They're all the same.

33:21.520 --> 33:23.140
I thought you were
warming to that new fella.

33:23.240 --> 33:24.060
He just tried telling me

33:24.160 --> 33:27.360
that Izzy was seeing an
older fella, one of ours.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.740
I would've known if she
had another boyfriend.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.580
Wouldn't be so sure about that.

33:32.680 --> 33:36.120
Your sister was almost as good
as you at keeping secrets.

33:42.360 --> 33:44.420
So I spoke to the owner
of your blue car,

33:44.520 --> 33:45.980
Pastor Tim Foster.

33:46.080 --> 33:47.860
He was in New Zealand at
the time of the murders,

33:47.960 --> 33:49.220
but he said that he sold the car

33:49.320 --> 33:51.220
to some young guy who was
doing some work

33:51.320 --> 33:52.300
for him around the church.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.580
This young guy got a name?

33:53.680 --> 33:55.020
Ezekiel Iesul.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.740
I-E-S-U-L.

33:57.840 --> 34:00.620
I ran his name and pinged on
the Border Force database.

34:00.720 --> 34:04.540
He entered Australia
from Vanuatu in 1979

34:04.640 --> 34:07.820
when he was just a kid through
his visa, but he never left.

34:07.920 --> 34:08.860
Doesn't show up anywhere else.

34:08.960 --> 34:12.400
No ATO, no social security
or medical records.

34:13.840 --> 34:14.900
Thank you, rookie.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.940
You'll make a mighty fine
detective one day.

34:17.040 --> 34:18.540
Goodbye.

34:18.640 --> 34:20.940
(crickets chirping)

34:21.040 --> 34:23.300
(James sighing)

34:23.400 --> 34:25.400
Ezekiel Israel.

34:26.520 --> 34:31.200
(people chattering indistinctly)

34:31.320 --> 34:33.460
(knocking at door)

34:33.560 --> 34:34.860
(paper rustling)

34:34.960 --> 34:35.900
(James groans)

34:36.000 --> 34:37.860
(James exhales)

34:37.960 --> 34:39.380
(crickets chirping)
(hand thuds)

34:39.480 --> 34:40.700
(door clacks)

34:40.800 --> 34:44.260
(crickets chirping)

34:44.360 --> 34:48.140
I, um, thought you
were my food.

34:48.240 --> 34:50.100
Can I come in?

34:50.200 --> 34:52.200
(blows raspberry)
You've come this far.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.960
Thanks.

34:56.280 --> 34:57.060
(door thuds)

34:57.160 --> 34:58.900
Neat freak, I see.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.400
Oh, I wasn't,
uh, expecting company.

35:04.480 --> 35:05.940
I remember Issy
reading this book.

35:06.040 --> 35:08.360
She got in so much trouble
when Dad found out.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.060
How do you know?

35:11.160 --> 35:13.440
She had it in parts
of the video.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.720
What was Richie's
favourite book?

35:23.440 --> 35:27.540
Um, don't remember.

35:27.640 --> 35:29.620
Right.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.700
(book thuds)

35:31.800 --> 35:34.560
That older man theory might
have a ring of truth to it.

35:35.440 --> 35:37.460
Aunty Rosa said that
there was a guy

35:37.560 --> 35:38.820
working at the mill
at the time,

35:38.920 --> 35:40.180
Issy was running
around with.

35:40.280 --> 35:41.940
Ezekiel.

35:42.040 --> 35:42.820
How'd you know?

35:42.920 --> 35:45.500
He was the owner of the
blue station wagon?

35:45.600 --> 35:48.780
(crickets chirping)

35:48.880 --> 35:50.340
Fuck!

35:50.440 --> 35:52.220
Does this mean Turner
was right all along?

35:52.320 --> 35:53.540
I don't know, maybe.

35:53.640 --> 35:56.600
But it does mean that
we have to find Ezekiel,

35:57.880 --> 35:59.340
and that's not going
to be easy

35:59.440 --> 36:02.480
because he's been here
illegally for 25 years.

36:03.680 --> 36:05.700
Okay.

36:05.800 --> 36:07.580
I can get word out on the
Murri grapevine.

36:07.680 --> 36:08.700
We can find him that way.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.800
I'll try anything.

36:12.160 --> 36:14.240
And Aunt gave me this.

36:17.560 --> 36:19.540
That's him, huh?

36:19.640 --> 36:20.660
I think so.

36:20.760 --> 36:23.280
(tense music)

36:26.080 --> 36:31.080
(guitar thrumming)
(birds chirping)

36:35.960 --> 36:39.720
(guitar thrumming continues)

36:44.040 --> 36:48.120
(people chattering indistinctly)

36:49.200 --> 36:51.200
Hey.

36:51.520 --> 36:52.740
Um, do you need anything,

36:52.840 --> 36:55.500
gloves or a long sleeve shirt
for the sun?

36:55.600 --> 36:56.580
No, thanks. I'm all good.

36:56.680 --> 36:58.540
I'm not picking,
I'm in the mill.

36:58.640 --> 36:59.380
Oh, okay.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.620
I heard you sing on
Sunday at church.

37:01.720 --> 37:02.940
It was really beautiful.

37:03.040 --> 37:05.580
Thanks. You're
Pastor Joe's daughter.

37:05.680 --> 37:06.540
I'm Ezekiel.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.820
I'm Isabel. Where do
you usually live?

37:08.920 --> 37:11.380
I live in Sydney,
but I move around a lot.

37:11.480 --> 37:13.480
I just follow the work.

37:13.800 --> 37:14.940
How you like Ashford?

37:15.040 --> 37:17.380
Yeah, it's such a
lovely community

37:17.480 --> 37:18.980
and the beach is close.

37:19.080 --> 37:20.300
I really need the water.

37:20.400 --> 37:22.060
What beach do you go to?

37:22.160 --> 37:23.620
I think it's called
South Beach.

37:23.720 --> 37:25.860
Oh. Oh, yeah, that's nice.

37:25.960 --> 37:28.620
But Shell Bay is a lot better.

37:28.720 --> 37:31.740
I can take you there.
(birds chirping)

37:31.840 --> 37:34.260
What would Pastor Joe
think about that?

37:34.360 --> 37:37.020
He would like that. It's,
you know, good hospitality.

37:37.120 --> 37:39.120
Helping the visitors.

37:40.160 --> 37:42.460
Um, but meet tomorrow
at 7:00 AM at the park.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.560
Yeah.

37:45.120 --> 37:47.020
What? What?

37:47.120 --> 37:51.100
(people chattering indistinctly)

37:51.200 --> 37:53.380
(plastic container thuds)

37:53.480 --> 37:55.900
Mama's taking forever.
I'm so hungry.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Yeah, she's having a yarn.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.100
(engine rumbling)

38:02.200 --> 38:04.960
(engine revving)

38:08.880 --> 38:12.000
Aye, come on. You're not
on your own time now.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.860
Hurry the fuck up!

38:14.960 --> 38:17.360
Billy Hopkins is such a creep.

38:18.520 --> 38:23.520
(keys clangs)
(engine revving)

38:23.960 --> 38:26.580
(shift gear rattling)

38:26.680 --> 38:29.900
(engine revving)

38:30.000 --> 38:32.560
(gentle music)

38:33.520 --> 38:36.280
(birds chirping)

38:38.320 --> 38:39.660
(water splashing)

38:39.760 --> 38:41.580
You're so
lucky to grow up here.

38:41.680 --> 38:44.520
Yeah, I guess. But
I can't wait to see Sydney.

38:46.360 --> 38:48.480
Sydney never really
felt that home to me.

38:49.360 --> 38:52.620
(water splashing)

38:52.720 --> 38:54.020
I was born on Tana,

38:54.120 --> 38:55.740
and I moved away when
I was really young,

38:55.840 --> 38:57.840
but it's home.

38:59.320 --> 39:00.820
It's in my blood.

39:00.920 --> 39:03.500
(water sploshing)

39:03.600 --> 39:05.600
I miss it.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
I feel it in here.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Have you been back?

39:12.360 --> 39:14.360
I want to, but

39:14.840 --> 39:15.740
(birds chirping)

39:15.840 --> 39:17.140
ever since my father died

39:17.240 --> 39:19.320
I've had more responsibilities.

39:19.840 --> 39:23.260
I have to provide for my
family, back on the island.

39:23.360 --> 39:25.940
(water sploshing)

39:26.040 --> 39:27.940
What about you?
(birds chirping)

39:28.040 --> 39:30.140
Your family are from Tana.

39:30.240 --> 39:30.980
(birds chirping)

39:31.080 --> 39:33.060
Have you ever been home?

39:33.160 --> 39:35.160
No, not yet.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.880
But maybe we could go
there together one day.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.460
(both chuckles)

39:40.560 --> 39:42.060
Maybe.
(birds chirping)

39:42.160 --> 39:45.420
(water sploshing)

39:45.520 --> 39:47.520
Time to swim, aye?

39:51.160 --> 39:53.300
(water sploshing)

39:53.400 --> 39:56.220
Wait, that tattoo.
I've seen one the same.

39:56.320 --> 39:58.320
What does it mean?

39:59.000 --> 40:00.820
Where did you see it?

40:00.920 --> 40:02.180
(tense music)

40:02.280 --> 40:04.100
On a boy out at Dalkeith.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.220
When was this?

40:05.320 --> 40:06.060
On Sunday.

40:06.160 --> 40:08.220
Did you
talk to the boy?

40:08.320 --> 40:10.620
No, he was running,
someone was chasing him.

40:10.720 --> 40:11.820
That boy's my cousin.

40:11.920 --> 40:13.300
Who was chasing him?

40:13.400 --> 40:15.660
I don't know. It was a
man on a trailer bike.

40:15.760 --> 40:17.420
I need you
to show me right now.

40:17.520 --> 40:18.820
I can't.
I have to go to school.

40:18.920 --> 40:20.460
Aw!

40:20.560 --> 40:21.540
(door thuds)

40:21.640 --> 40:22.700
(door thuds)

40:22.800 --> 40:25.280
(tense music)

40:30.840 --> 40:34.160
(tense music continues)

40:37.720 --> 40:39.720
Tell me what you saw.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.420
He came from there.

40:42.520 --> 40:45.540
He fell over and
dropped his boots.

40:45.640 --> 40:48.080
And a trail bike
came from over there.

40:49.960 --> 40:52.780
And the boy, (sighs)

40:52.880 --> 40:54.060
he got up and kept running,

40:54.160 --> 40:56.320
and the bike went after him.

40:57.600 --> 40:58.740
And then they were gone.

40:58.840 --> 41:01.180
Someone was trying
to hurt him.

41:01.280 --> 41:02.340
Who?

41:02.440 --> 41:03.180
I don't know.

41:03.280 --> 41:04.060
Why didn't you help him?

41:04.160 --> 41:04.940
I was scared.

41:05.040 --> 41:07.420
You was scared. (pants)

41:07.520 --> 41:10.040
(tense music)

41:16.360 --> 41:17.900
(Ezekiel yelling)
(wooden rod clanging)

41:18.000 --> 41:20.520
(tense music)

41:25.920 --> 41:29.280
(tense music continues)

41:36.200 --> 41:38.820
Sorry about the decor, mate.

41:38.920 --> 41:40.920
Not much privacy around here.

41:42.400 --> 41:44.880
(exhales) So, what's going on.

41:45.440 --> 41:47.440
Steve Walcott.

41:48.640 --> 41:49.420
All right, what about him?

41:49.520 --> 41:51.820
Issy had a fight with him
when we were at Chloe's

41:51.920 --> 41:53.920
getting ready for the formal.

41:54.600 --> 41:56.680
I can't remember
exactly what she said,

41:57.560 --> 42:00.960
but I know for certain
she called him a predator.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.500
Like in her letter.

42:04.600 --> 42:06.580
What do you reckon
she meant by that?

42:06.680 --> 42:08.380
I dunno.

42:08.480 --> 42:09.900
He was a bit of an old perv.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.460
Anyone else see this fight?

42:11.560 --> 42:13.220
Look, I've got
some of it on tape

42:13.320 --> 42:15.320
but I lost my camera
at the formal.

42:16.920 --> 42:18.900
You lost your camera, okay.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.740
And you just remembering
this now, huh?

42:20.840 --> 42:22.840
It was a long time ago.

42:25.960 --> 42:27.960
Anything else?

42:28.360 --> 42:30.220
No.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.320
Just thought that might help.

42:34.160 --> 42:35.380
Come on. Let's go.

42:35.480 --> 42:39.120
You're not going to tell Steve
this came from me, are you?

42:40.160 --> 42:42.020
No.

42:42.120 --> 42:44.120
But why do you care?

42:44.640 --> 42:45.380
He's just not someone

42:45.480 --> 42:47.380
you want to get on the wrong
side of.

42:47.480 --> 42:49.960
(tense music)

42:52.200 --> 42:56.080
(Isabel Voiceover) In 2019, I
predict that Ashford will be

42:56.920 --> 43:00.420
still full of predators
disguised as friends.

43:00.520 --> 43:03.040
(tense music)

43:08.080 --> 43:10.140
I've seen The Ankou here.

43:10.240 --> 43:12.440
Sharpening its scythe,

43:13.600 --> 43:14.900
waiting to reap our souls.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.480
(tense music)

43:23.000 --> 43:26.320
(tense music continues)

43:27.880 --> 43:29.900
There are people here
I trusted...

43:30.000 --> 43:32.480
(tense music)

43:39.400 --> 43:41.820
...but now I know they
feed on suffering.

43:41.920 --> 43:44.440
(tense music)

43:48.800 --> 43:51.760
One day, when I'm safe
from their clutches,

43:52.840 --> 43:54.840
I will expose them

43:56.160 --> 43:57.820
and their cruelty.

43:57.920 --> 44:00.440
(tense music)

44:08.000 --> 44:11.320
(tense music continues)

44:15.320 --> 44:17.400
That's if they don't
kill me first.

44:20.680 --> 44:22.060
(billiard ball clangs)

44:22.160 --> 44:25.860
(people chattering indistinctly)

44:25.960 --> 44:28.520
Welcome back, Billy. Welcome.

44:29.680 --> 44:30.900
My little sister,

44:31.000 --> 44:32.980
beer fairy since age 13.

44:33.080 --> 44:34.340
That's your only
freebie big bro.

44:34.440 --> 44:37.940
(people chattering indistinctly)

44:38.040 --> 44:39.980
So, when did you
get back? (exhales)

44:40.080 --> 44:42.080
Yesterday.

44:42.480 --> 44:44.780
Where are you staying?

44:44.880 --> 44:45.980
No room here.

44:46.080 --> 44:48.780
I'm squatting out at the
old place. It's empty.

44:48.880 --> 44:50.060
Why the hell
did you come back home

44:50.160 --> 44:52.140
if you're going to be staying
in that crack den?

44:52.240 --> 44:53.460
I'm glad you're back.

44:53.560 --> 44:54.940
-Are ya?
-I am.

44:55.040 --> 44:56.540
But, you know, I thought

44:56.640 --> 44:59.020
your parole officer set you up
with that job on the trawlers.

44:59.120 --> 45:02.760
Yeah well,
I get sea sick don't I.

45:03.720 --> 45:06.220
Then I got wind that they
were reopening the case,

45:06.320 --> 45:09.260
so I thought, you know?
(laughs)

45:09.360 --> 45:11.380
Oh, Jesus.

45:11.480 --> 45:14.660
Billy, what are you cooking up?

45:14.760 --> 45:17.580
(people chattering indistinctly)

45:17.680 --> 45:20.700
They give us these decks,
on the inside, you know,

45:20.800 --> 45:22.540
hoping people with snitch,

45:22.640 --> 45:25.760
get a reduction in their
sentence, you know. (chuckles)

45:30.040 --> 45:33.720
I spent a lot of time with
Isabel in my cell. (laughs)

45:39.200 --> 45:41.820
See, that story that
Turner spun back then,

45:41.920 --> 45:44.160
about the monster in the night,
see, that was bullshit.

45:47.440 --> 45:49.720
-What do you know?
-Enough.

45:50.680 --> 45:54.780
I've been sitting on a
lot of secrets. (chuckles)

45:54.880 --> 45:57.080
It's time to see how much
they're worth.

45:57.520 --> 46:01.260
(crickets chirping)
(engine revving)

46:01.360 --> 46:04.040
(phone ringing)

46:06.600 --> 46:07.460
Hey.

46:07.560 --> 46:09.220
I got word from
a cousin up north.

46:09.320 --> 46:11.320
Apparently Ezekiel's
in Townsville.

46:12.200 --> 46:13.380
That didn't take long.

46:13.480 --> 46:15.540
Um, thanks.

46:15.640 --> 46:16.420
Send me the address.

46:16.520 --> 46:18.340
I'll head up there first
thing in the morning.

46:18.440 --> 46:20.100
Yeah, we should leave early.

46:20.200 --> 46:21.660
Pick me up at 6:00 AM?

46:21.760 --> 46:23.340
Hang on, you're not invited.

46:23.440 --> 46:25.420
Uh, I'm the one that sent
word out to community

46:25.520 --> 46:26.500
to find him.

46:26.600 --> 46:28.060
There's going to be
blowback on me

46:28.160 --> 46:30.540
if a bully man rocks
up to their doorstep.

46:30.640 --> 46:32.460
Besides, no one's going
to talk to your albino ass

46:32.560 --> 46:34.560
if I'm not there.

46:35.760 --> 46:38.640
Okay, fine.
Pick you up at 6:00.

46:39.680 --> 46:42.300
(crickets chirping)

46:42.400 --> 46:45.120
(engine revving)

46:47.400 --> 46:49.740
(knock on door)

46:49.840 --> 46:50.820
(door clacks)

46:50.920 --> 46:51.660
Oh.

46:51.760 --> 46:53.460
Hello. Hi, Mary?

46:53.560 --> 46:54.500
Can I help you?

46:54.600 --> 46:57.660
I'm Hazel and this is
Detective James Cormack.

46:57.760 --> 46:59.220
-Hello.
-Hey.

46:59.320 --> 47:02.380
Uh, we're looking
for Ezekiel Iesul.

47:02.480 --> 47:04.300
Uh, what is this about?

47:04.400 --> 47:05.660
Uh, he's not in any trouble.

47:05.760 --> 47:07.500
Uh, we've just got a few
questions for him

47:07.600 --> 47:09.380
and we think he might be
able to help us.

47:09.480 --> 47:12.000
I doubt that.
Zeke died last year.

47:13.600 --> 47:16.560
Zeke was sick, but we
didn't have Medicare.

47:17.600 --> 47:20.420
Eventually, we went
to the hospital,

47:20.520 --> 47:23.720
but by the time we got
there it was too late.

47:28.480 --> 47:30.480
I'm so sorry, Mary.

47:33.640 --> 47:36.640
But why are you looking
for my husband?

47:37.120 --> 47:42.300
Well, (exhales) I'm
investigating an old case

47:42.400 --> 47:44.340
down in Ashford.

47:44.440 --> 47:45.620
The same time that Ezekiel

47:45.720 --> 47:47.720
was working down there in '94.

47:48.640 --> 47:50.640
Is this about the lost boys?

47:52.840 --> 47:56.220
Um, what lost boys
are you talking about?

47:56.320 --> 47:58.980
Ezekiel, he had two
cousins from Vanuatu.

47:59.080 --> 48:01.520
They went missing
in Ashford 25 years ago.

48:02.800 --> 48:03.660
What happened?

48:03.760 --> 48:05.700
Zeke was supposed
to protect them.

48:05.800 --> 48:08.860
His two cousins, they
were sons of a chief.

48:08.960 --> 48:11.580
And when he didn't
protect them,

48:11.680 --> 48:13.680
he brought shame
to this family.

48:14.520 --> 48:16.620
But it wasn't his fault.

48:16.720 --> 48:17.940
They just disappeared.

48:18.040 --> 48:19.460
Was this ever reported?

48:19.560 --> 48:21.920
Well, no. See,
Zeke was here illegally.

48:23.480 --> 48:25.140
And you think the police
are going to care

48:25.240 --> 48:27.780
about a couple of
kids from Vanuatu?

48:27.880 --> 48:31.660
Zeke, he wanted to go back
and he wanted to keep looking,

48:31.760 --> 48:32.500
but he was scared.

48:32.600 --> 48:34.180
He was frightened of Ashford.

48:34.280 --> 48:35.260
Frightened of what?

48:35.360 --> 48:38.740
He said there was
darkness in Ashford.

48:38.840 --> 48:40.500
The enemy lived there.

48:40.600 --> 48:43.700
And then when he couldn't
find them two boys,

48:43.800 --> 48:45.900
he got angry and
he hurt someone.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.480
(tense music)

48:53.880 --> 48:57.220
(tense music continues)

48:57.320 --> 48:59.440
Mary, I want you to
be truthful with me.

49:00.600 --> 49:02.600
Who did he hurt?

49:04.800 --> 49:05.860
I don't know.

49:05.960 --> 49:06.700
Mary.

49:06.800 --> 49:09.260
I don't know who he
hurt. He didn't tell me.

49:09.360 --> 49:10.780
But my Zeke,

49:10.880 --> 49:15.700
my Zeke, he was a gentle
and kind man.

49:15.800 --> 49:19.040
But he said the enemy
got inside him that night

49:19.680 --> 49:21.820
and he just lost control.

49:21.920 --> 49:24.440
(tense music)

49:29.360 --> 49:30.740
Mary?

49:30.840 --> 49:32.840
Yes.

49:34.440 --> 49:35.580
How did you get this?

49:35.680 --> 49:37.680
That's a friend of Zeke's.

49:38.200 --> 49:40.200
He sends a card
every Christmas.

49:44.560 --> 49:46.720
Do you know him?

49:51.360 --> 49:54.000
(intense music)
