WEBVTT

00:02.003 --> 00:04.269
We're all going swimming
later, if you wanna...

00:04.338 --> 00:05.504
Get to know you better.

00:05.573 --> 00:06.939
(Juliette)
Last year, with Alex.

00:07.008 --> 00:08.707
I was planning on
hitting up the beach later.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.609
(Juliette)
This year, with Jared.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.178
I have a boyfriend
and I want to keep this quiet.

00:13.247 --> 00:15.547
(Juliette)
And with her new boyfriend
in town for a visit,

00:15.616 --> 00:16.949
we're all wondering...

00:17.018 --> 00:17.850
Oh, I missed you!

00:17.918 --> 00:20.019
...can Kelsey
keep a secret?

00:20.087 --> 00:22.855
But sometimes you just
need to tell the truth.

00:22.923 --> 00:24.623
I don't have the greatest
relationship with my dad.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.325
I needed a mom, and then
she moved to Australia

00:26.394 --> 00:27.826
when I was 16.

00:27.895 --> 00:29.962
(Juliette)
Lately, Canvas has been
opening up,

00:30.031 --> 00:32.197
and had discovered that
when you let people in,

00:32.266 --> 00:34.333
anything can happen.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.168
But that's not always
a good thing.

00:36.237 --> 00:39.538
Chloe invited Alex's ex,
Cara, back into our group.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.206
I don't want my boyfriend's
ex-girlfriend here.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.976
Yeah, but like, he also (bleep)
all of your other friends.

00:44.045 --> 00:46.745
(Juliette)
And even though
she's talking to Garrett,

00:46.814 --> 00:48.747
I know she's really here
for Alex.

00:48.816 --> 00:51.083
What do I have to do
to get you to go away?

00:51.152 --> 00:53.018
That girl has to go.

So, how was school today?

01:30.858 --> 01:32.191
Did you have a good day?
Good.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.892
You did?
Awesome.

01:33.961 --> 01:36.462
Did you have a good day,
Bronson? Yeah?

01:36.530 --> 01:38.697
Sarah! Bronson!
Hi!

01:38.766 --> 01:40.899
We got you some
graduation flowers.

01:40.968 --> 01:42.734
What do you say?
Thank you!

01:42.803 --> 01:44.770
(Juliette)
If you wanna see
Alex's softer side,

01:44.839 --> 01:47.806
you have to see him with
his younger brother and sister.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.842
They're both adults
living with autism,

01:49.910 --> 01:52.778
and they're the inspiration
for the annual charity gala.

01:52.847 --> 01:55.047
My brother and sister,
they're fortunate enough

01:55.116 --> 01:57.516
that we can afford care,
but there's others

01:57.585 --> 01:59.551
that can barely
put food on the table.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.087
I wanted to do something.

02:02.156 --> 02:04.189
I love how much time
you spend with them.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.592
I'm their big brother,
and I enjoy doing it, so...
Yeah.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.327
And how much work
you put into the gala.

02:08.395 --> 02:11.063
Great Gatsby was
an easy theme,
but Egyptian's more--

02:11.132 --> 02:13.232
I think it's just
gonna be cooler-looking.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.666
Mama knows best.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.301
You know I'm borrowing
a dress from your mom?

02:16.370 --> 02:17.669
Really?
Yeah.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.471
We have the same size,
so any time

02:19.540 --> 02:20.806
there's a big event--
So convenient.

02:20.875 --> 02:22.741
I know.
I'm like, what do I wear?

02:22.810 --> 02:24.409
And I bought a bunch
of dresses first,

02:24.478 --> 02:26.345
and she's like, "No, no,
you're wearing this."

02:26.413 --> 02:28.046
You guys seem to be
getting pretty close.

02:28.115 --> 02:28.981
I do like that.

02:29.049 --> 02:31.350
I know, I'm really happy
we are too.

02:31.418 --> 02:32.951
I'm sure you'll look
beautiful.

02:33.020 --> 02:35.220
You think Garrett's
gonna bring Cara?

02:35.289 --> 02:37.156
I mean, probably.

02:37.224 --> 02:38.290
It's like one
of those parties

02:38.359 --> 02:39.691
where you bring, like,
a plus-one.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.161
But hey, if she's here,
it's for the cause,

02:42.229 --> 02:44.029
it's not for drama,
and like...
Sure.

02:44.098 --> 02:46.532
I would just...
That's why she's coming.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.799
Dude...
I still can't believe

02:47.868 --> 02:49.101
he even brought her
to Miami.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.936
He kind of just disregards
what I say,

02:51.005 --> 02:53.005
what I, like,
politely ask.

02:53.073 --> 02:55.174
I just wouldn't--
I wouldn't even feed into it.

02:55.242 --> 02:56.909
Cara's the type
of person that's always

02:56.977 --> 03:00.579
just gonna, like, secretly
do something really sketchy.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.915
Like, she could be
full-blown dating Garrett,

03:02.983 --> 03:05.017
and still, like,
come after you.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.587
She's obviously shady,
and, like,

03:08.656 --> 03:10.055
you-- you called it out,
and I've told you

03:10.124 --> 03:11.190
she's shady in the past.

03:11.258 --> 03:14.693
And she told me some stuff
about Chloe in Miami.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.662
What?
She straight up said

03:16.730 --> 03:19.798
Chloe is hard to deal with
and she can't stand her.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.300
She said that to you?
Yeah.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.569
She said that to you?
I swear on everything.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.804
I literally swear
on everything.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.807
I don't have a problem
with you, you know that.

03:34.515 --> 03:35.747
What'd you say?

03:35.816 --> 03:37.983
I mean, I was just like,
I kinda agreed with her.

03:38.052 --> 03:40.252
You know, it's like...
I can't wait to tell her.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.154
Who?
Chloe!

03:43.624 --> 03:44.990
That's her, like,
best friend.

03:45.059 --> 03:46.491
Like, she claims she's
like the sweetest girl,

03:46.560 --> 03:48.227
except she's talking (bleep)
about her to you.

03:48.295 --> 03:51.530
If you say something, you know
what this is gonna turn out to?

03:51.599 --> 03:53.165
A huge...
Bye-bye, Cara.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.869
♪ Baby, it's
a brand-new day ♪

03:57.938 --> 03:59.304
♪ Ain't no clouds
hanging over me ♪

03:59.373 --> 04:01.139
(Garrett)
This is the spot.
(Cara)
Ooh!

04:01.208 --> 04:03.575
All right, so this is,
like, the fun space.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.977
This is where we come back.
Cool!

04:05.045 --> 04:06.778
So, what actually
happens in this room?

04:06.847 --> 04:08.380
We make videos.
Obviously, we have, like,

04:08.449 --> 04:10.048
the workout set-up
over there.

04:10.117 --> 04:13.085
All those cute
Insta videos that I see,

04:13.153 --> 04:14.186
they're all shot here?

04:14.255 --> 04:16.054
Pretty much all of 'em
are shot here, actually.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.190
Yeah, I literally do those,
like, all the time.

04:18.259 --> 04:19.858
I have a lot of information
you can learn from.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.593
Okay, well,
you need to teach me.

04:21.662 --> 04:23.128
What do you think
of the place, though?

04:23.197 --> 04:25.097
I'm impressed.
It came a long ways,
that's for sure.

04:25.165 --> 04:27.165
It started in my bedroom
on my laptop,

04:27.234 --> 04:30.168
to a full-on, like,
warehouse with...

04:30.237 --> 04:31.036
That's so cool.

04:31.105 --> 04:32.638
Did your parents
help you at all?

04:32.706 --> 04:34.606
No, they did not at all.
Really?

04:34.675 --> 04:36.074
It's just me.
Yeah, that's cool.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.776
So, how you feeling
after everything

04:37.845 --> 04:39.077
that happened
in, like, Miami?

04:39.146 --> 04:41.146
I don't know,
the whole situation

04:41.215 --> 04:42.948
is still, like,
a little bit weird to me.

04:43.017 --> 04:45.717
Yeah.
How when Juliette
was attacking me,

04:45.786 --> 04:48.253
Chloe didn't, like,
do really anything about it.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.455
Yeah.
I get, like,
it's hard to be friends

04:50.524 --> 04:51.690
with both of us,
but it's like...

04:51.759 --> 04:54.626
Yeah, for sure.
Just kind of shady.

04:54.695 --> 04:58.230
I mean, that's honestly,
like, Chloe in general.

04:58.299 --> 04:59.931
Right.
I mean, I've known her
since high school,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.067
and she's done
the same thing since then.

05:02.136 --> 05:04.336
I'm just starting to realize
that being friends with Chloe

05:04.405 --> 05:08.240
is like very overwhelming,
and she's a lot to handle.

05:08.309 --> 05:09.741
Yeah.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.310
The last person
I would want to know

05:11.378 --> 05:13.845
about, like, what's going on
between me and you is Chloe,

05:13.914 --> 05:15.414
'cause she'll go around,
you know,

05:15.482 --> 05:16.982
saying false information,

05:17.051 --> 05:19.184
and that is
the last thing I want.

05:19.253 --> 05:21.620
Then let's try and keep her
out of our business.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.356
Yeah, let's do that.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.590
Sounds good.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.859
("Moonlight Sonata" playing)

05:27.928 --> 05:29.928
This is where I'll place
all the high tops.

05:29.997 --> 05:33.265
So, once you bring 'em up,
I'll get 'em in position.

05:33.334 --> 05:36.702
(Juliette)
Grandma Beverly controls
Pauly's trust fund.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.203
So, when she's in town,

05:38.272 --> 05:40.739
Pauly's always on
his best behavior.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.107
(Alex)
Is this tuned all right?
It's okay?

05:42.176 --> 05:44.109
(Pauly)
Yeah, it's sounding good.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.144
(Juliette)
And since she paid for years
of his piano lessons,

05:46.213 --> 05:47.679
he's hoping to score
major points

05:47.748 --> 05:49.181
by playing at the gala.

05:49.249 --> 05:52.517
But we all know he's had
performance issues in the past.

05:52.586 --> 05:55.320
(indistinct rapping
and chatter)

05:55.389 --> 05:56.888
(girl)
He's turning it off!

05:56.957 --> 05:58.757
(feedback,
microphone shuts off)

05:58.826 --> 06:01.360
(chatter continues)

06:03.097 --> 06:04.796
I think we should
have a little toast.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.565
This calls for
a celebration.

06:06.633 --> 06:07.666
(Beverly)
This early?

06:07.735 --> 06:08.700
Well, I mean...

06:08.769 --> 06:09.868
For goodness sakes.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.470
You aren't smoking pot,
are you?

06:11.538 --> 06:13.271
Not as much.
Honestly, Grandma...

06:13.340 --> 06:14.406
(laughing)

06:14.475 --> 06:16.842
If you don't cut down
on your partying,

06:16.910 --> 06:18.977
you're not gonna
get money from me.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.012
I'm gonna give
my all to this.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.514
I've been working
really hard at it,

06:22.583 --> 06:24.616
and I hope that
it pays off.

06:24.685 --> 06:25.984
Yeah.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.386
(Beth)
I'd love to show you
around the house.

06:27.454 --> 06:29.321
You wanna take a tour?
I'd love to.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.390
You'll love it, Grandma.
Okay, let's start
towards the kitchen.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.258
Thank you so much, Beth.

06:33.327 --> 06:35.861
Jesus Christ, I need
a drink after that.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.196
It's so funny that
she always brings up the pot.

06:38.265 --> 06:39.831
Oh my--
it's the first thing.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.500
I mean, this is huge, man.

06:41.568 --> 06:42.901
The fact that
you're doing this,

06:42.970 --> 06:44.169
it's gonna mean
a lot to her.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.138
You know I'm kind of
a selfish person.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.640
I like to have my-- my drink,
I like my weed.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.175
I don't like
to change for anybody.

06:50.244 --> 06:53.278
I'll change for her
for at least one night.

06:53.347 --> 06:54.413
I'm not gonna drink

06:54.481 --> 06:56.381
until the performance
is over tomorrow.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.950
If I screw this up,
I'll never hear the end of it.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.520
And she'd probably end up
just cutting me off.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.926

(Juliette)
I don't usually say
nice things about Chloe,

07:14.635 --> 07:17.402
but sometimes when you need
a friend to talk to,

07:17.471 --> 07:19.971
she's exactly
the right person to call.

07:20.040 --> 07:23.008
(Chloe)
Well, cheers, guys.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.509
Oh.

07:24.578 --> 07:27.279
Oh, my God, I...
I tap wine too, it's okay.

07:27.347 --> 07:28.780
What?
We tapped our wine

07:28.849 --> 07:29.948
like really classy ladies.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.383
That's so funny!

07:31.452 --> 07:33.218
We're real classy here,
so it doesn't matter.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.853
So, what's going on?
You texted me

07:34.922 --> 07:37.355
that you had something
serious to talk about.

07:37.424 --> 07:39.024
You're making me nervous.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.759
I mean, I'm not dying
or anything, don't worry.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.894
Okay.
We all know about,

07:42.963 --> 07:45.363
like, my mom situation,
and like, you know...

07:45.432 --> 07:47.065
Oh, like how you haven't
seen her in forever.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.400
Yeah, it's been,
like, six years,

07:48.469 --> 07:49.968
and she's been
in Australia, and like,

07:50.037 --> 07:52.771
we have, like,
a strained relationship.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.873
Mm-hmm.
So, I got her

07:54.942 --> 07:57.609
to say yes to coming
and to see me.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.377
She's flying
from Australia?

07:59.446 --> 08:02.681
Yeah.
And I'm scared (bleep)less.

08:02.749 --> 08:04.049
And we're gonna talk.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.551
But you've never, like,
told me why

08:06.620 --> 08:08.186
you guys don't speak anymore.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.522
So, my mom and my dad,
they got divorced

08:10.591 --> 08:11.823
when I was, like six.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.593
At 13, my mom decided
it would be better

08:14.661 --> 08:16.495
if I went and stayed
with my sister.

08:16.563 --> 08:19.764
And then she decided
she was gonna move
to Australia,

08:19.833 --> 08:22.501
and I didn't wanna
move to Australia.

08:22.569 --> 08:24.936
So, I'm being abandoned
for the second time

08:25.005 --> 08:26.705
in my (bleep) life
when I (bleep)...

08:26.773 --> 08:29.207
Do you know how much
I needed her at 16?

08:30.577 --> 08:33.011
There's been so many
situations in my life,

08:33.080 --> 08:34.913
and I don't have anyone
to (bleep) go to,

08:34.982 --> 08:36.815
and I have to sit here
and pray that my friends

08:36.884 --> 08:37.983
that are the same age as me

08:38.051 --> 08:40.018
have some (bleep) advice
for me to--

08:40.087 --> 08:42.454
how to deal with
the situation, like...

08:48.395 --> 08:50.428
Like, I never want
anyone that I love

08:50.497 --> 08:53.331
to ever feel alone,
'cause you're not alone.

08:56.670 --> 09:00.005
What do you hope to get
from this conversation
with your mom?

09:00.073 --> 09:02.207
Like, are you wanting
a better relationship?

09:02.276 --> 09:07.279
I want her to fully
comprehend everything,

09:07.347 --> 09:08.813
and I want her to get it.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.416
There's so much (bleep)
that has happened in my life,

09:11.485 --> 09:15.186
that if I was put
in a normal home,

09:15.255 --> 09:16.855
wouldn't have happened.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.356
Like, I've been molested.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.028
What?

09:24.464 --> 09:26.264
Like...

09:26.333 --> 09:30.402
I didn't know you were going
through all of this, man.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.470
I don't really
let people in.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.639
And how the (bleep)
am I ever supposed to feel

09:34.708 --> 09:36.775
that anyone (bleep) wants
to be around me

09:36.843 --> 09:38.410
if my two (bleep)
parents don't?

09:38.478 --> 09:41.746
This is the exact things
you need to be saying to her

09:41.815 --> 09:43.281
when you guys see each other.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.849
Do you think you're gonna
be able to say these things

09:44.918 --> 09:45.984
to her face?

09:46.053 --> 09:49.321
I mean, I'm gonna do
my damnedest.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.489
There are so many people
that are here for you

09:51.558 --> 09:55.360
even though
you don't feel like it.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.862
You're okay.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.665
We love you.
Don't worry, I got you.

10:00.734 --> 10:01.967

Coming up...

10:02.035 --> 10:03.435

10:03.503 --> 10:06.938
You've met Kelsey's
beach buddy, I see.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.540

your (bleep) business?

10:32.499 --> 10:33.999
You know,
when I was younger,

10:34.067 --> 10:36.067
I went and did
some time in juvie

10:36.136 --> 10:37.769
for possession
of marijuana.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.004
Paul's in jail.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.205
(Gary)
Marijuana possession.

(Alex)
Not more than 20 grams.

10:41.642 --> 10:42.974

you been locked up?

10:43.043 --> 10:43.975

(Juliette)
Grandma Beverly
doesn't know the half of it,

10:49.116 --> 10:51.316
and she can even tell
he's kind of a mess.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.518
May I interest you in
a margarita or iced tea?

10:53.587 --> 10:55.887
I think I'll have a margarita.
You want one, Grandma?

10:55.956 --> 10:58.490
Maybe just an iced tea.
Yeah.

10:58.558 --> 11:01.493
Paul, what's your plan
for the future?

11:01.561 --> 11:03.428
Music.
Music?

11:03.497 --> 11:05.997
Music.
What kind of music?

11:06.066 --> 11:07.532
Rapping.
Oh, Paul.

11:07.601 --> 11:10.435
Grandma, I've come to
love to-- I love to rap.

11:10.504 --> 11:13.238
I love to get on the stage
and I love to perform

11:13.306 --> 11:15.040
in front of an audience
with a microphone

11:15.108 --> 11:16.641
and use my voice to do it.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.477
Do you have a backup plan?

11:19.546 --> 11:22.013
You have to think
about those things.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.515
I gotta figure
something out.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.650
You gotta be sensible.
I'm blessed to have you,

11:25.719 --> 11:27.852
but I know you won't be here
to help me forever.

11:27.921 --> 11:31.656
No.
(sighs)

11:31.725 --> 11:34.459
That reminds me...
you know, Grandma,

11:34.528 --> 11:37.562
I could really use some
extra money this month.

11:37.631 --> 11:39.297
But you were left money

11:39.366 --> 11:41.499
that you could have
used sensibly.

11:41.568 --> 11:44.669
I-- I probably just don't
manage money the right way,

11:44.738 --> 11:48.473
'cause my dad left me
that $500,000,

11:48.542 --> 11:50.809
and no kid should get left
that amount of money.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.044
I mean, three years
down here in Sarasota

11:53.113 --> 11:55.180
drained most of the money.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.949
And if it wasn't
for you stepping in,

11:58.018 --> 11:59.484
I probably wouldn't have
anything left.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.587
Well, I'm thankful
that I could.

12:02.656 --> 12:05.090
But maybe you've learned
your lesson.

12:05.158 --> 12:08.126
You gotta be sensible.
Yeah.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.897
Sure wouldn't mind
having another margarita.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.866
I don't want you
to become an alcoholic.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.601
I'm not an alcoholic.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.570
I mean, I like
to drink sometimes.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.305
Trust me, I've lost
two parents.

12:20.373 --> 12:23.208
I know what
you went through.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.410
You went through
a real bad time.

12:25.479 --> 12:28.379
I mean, I had just watched
my dad die a year before,

12:28.448 --> 12:32.250
and then--
then my mom gets cancer.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.559
(choking up)
It's just been--
it's been too much.

12:41.628 --> 12:44.896
I know.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.397
And if anything
happened to you,

12:46.466 --> 12:48.967
I don't know what
I would do.

12:49.035 --> 12:51.402
You have to
stay strong, Paul.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.807
That's what I want,
you to live the good life--

12:55.876 --> 12:58.042

But then, it got brought
to our attention

17:32.852 --> 17:34.385
about the Haven program.

17:34.454 --> 17:37.455
What this program does, is it
teaches these kids trades.

a beautiful program,

Hello, darling.

26:40.299 --> 26:41.599
Hi, cookie.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.133
Mama's back.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.305
You look beautiful.
Thanks.

26:50.543 --> 26:52.309
How was the flight?

26:52.378 --> 26:54.845
It was long.
Mm-hmm.

26:54.914 --> 26:58.015
Well, obviously,
I wasn't expecting

26:58.084 --> 27:01.418
to do this any time soon.
I felt like it's time.

27:01.487 --> 27:03.954
You obviously know
that we don't talk...
Right.

27:04.023 --> 27:07.491
...or we don't do anything,
so, like...

27:07.560 --> 27:08.993
I'm sorry I left.

27:10.696 --> 27:12.396
It's not just that.

It's everything.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.101
Dad left.
Right.

27:17.169 --> 27:19.370
You know about all
of my abandonment issues.

27:19.438 --> 27:21.138
And then you left.

27:23.976 --> 27:26.110
13.

27:26.178 --> 27:28.479
Those are like fundamental
growing woman years,

27:28.547 --> 27:29.880
and you weren't there, like...

27:29.949 --> 27:31.582
I don't see how
you can feel that, Canvas.

27:31.651 --> 27:33.017
Like, you had me--
how were you, 33?

27:33.085 --> 27:35.486
Yeah.
And I wasn't
kid number one.

27:35.554 --> 27:36.954
I was kid number four.

27:37.023 --> 27:38.956
You should have done
something by then.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.524
You should have
figured something out,

27:40.593 --> 27:41.859
or you should have stopped
having kids,

27:41.927 --> 27:43.794
because it's not fair
that I had to go through

27:43.863 --> 27:46.196
the (bleep) that I had
to go through.

27:46.265 --> 27:49.166
If that pissed you off,
then I think that

27:49.235 --> 27:51.869
your perception
and my perception
are different.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.639
Do you understand the reason
I don't have friendships,

27:55.708 --> 27:58.876
I don't get close to people,
is everyone (bleep) leaves.

28:00.513 --> 28:02.813
Like, I've just felt like
I never had any protection

28:02.882 --> 28:04.982
from anything--
That's not true, sweetheart.

28:05.051 --> 28:07.351
But it is true.
Things have happened.

28:07.420 --> 28:10.654
I was molested
as a child.

28:10.723 --> 28:12.723
That happened.
What should I have done?

28:14.527 --> 28:15.993
Everything!
Something!

28:16.062 --> 28:17.728
You didn't do (bleep).
That's not true.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.496
And I took the blame
for that.

28:19.565 --> 28:21.231
Yeah.

28:22.635 --> 28:26.070
(bleep). (bleep).
Stop. Stop.

28:26.138 --> 28:28.806
I'm not ready for you
to, like, hug on me yet.

28:28.874 --> 28:31.809
Like, I'm not.
I'm not there yet.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.010
That's why I said, and th
what do you want me to do?

28:33.079 --> 28:34.311
Okay.
Help show me how to do it,

28:34.380 --> 28:35.646

29:16.589 --> 29:18.155

Yeah, I've got chardonnay.

29:18.224 --> 29:19.323
Nice.

29:19.391 --> 29:20.491
What did you think
about the gala?

29:20.559 --> 29:21.859
I thought the gala was sick.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.694
It's crazy how they keep
going bigger

29:23.763 --> 29:25.362
and better, like...
Exactly.

29:25.431 --> 29:26.964
I didn't even get
a camel ride.

29:27.032 --> 29:28.365
Were people
getting camel rides?

29:28.434 --> 29:30.267
I wanted to have the python
with the camel ride

29:30.336 --> 29:31.635
and get it on Instagram.

29:31.704 --> 29:33.103
(laughter)

29:33.172 --> 29:34.238
That's great.

29:34.306 --> 29:36.073
I never, like, seen you
play the piano in, like,

29:36.142 --> 29:37.608
a setting like that.
Like, that was like, wow.

29:37.676 --> 29:40.344
It was-- you know,
it was a nerve-wracking thing.

29:40.412 --> 29:42.246
There's people
offering me drinks,

29:42.314 --> 29:43.814
"Let's go get a drink,"
this, that, and the other.

29:43.883 --> 29:46.350
And I just, like, kinda stay
with the same glass

29:46.418 --> 29:48.085
of champagne
most of the night.

29:48.154 --> 29:50.687
That's a good thing.
It was hard to keep
that under control.

29:50.756 --> 29:52.122
I know, but you did,
you know?

29:52.191 --> 29:53.824
And like, I was proud
of you for doing that,

29:53.893 --> 29:55.359
and I was happy to see
your grandma

29:55.427 --> 29:57.828
seeing her, like, grandson,
and be like proud and happy.

29:57.897 --> 29:59.062
I seen it in her face
and her eyes

29:59.131 --> 30:00.230
watching you
play the piano.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.732
It was just, like,
really cool.

30:01.801 --> 30:03.433
We were definitely,
like, more low-key

30:03.502 --> 30:04.701
when she was here.

30:04.770 --> 30:06.036
Well, I knew if I sat there
and acted up,

30:06.105 --> 30:07.371
my grandmother's
gonna be like,

30:07.439 --> 30:08.939
"What in the world
are you doing?"

30:09.008 --> 30:11.308
And she'd probably end up just
cutting me off financially.

30:11.377 --> 30:13.777
Yeah.
And that's not a place
you want to be.

30:13.846 --> 30:16.113
That's not where
you wanna be, right.

30:16.182 --> 30:19.183
I'm glad that she's back
in North Carolina.
She's back in Greensboro.

30:19.251 --> 30:20.951
Now, we can turn
this party...
Yeah.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.319
Maybe not
all the way, but...

30:22.388 --> 30:24.555
Maybe just--
just a little bit of the way.

30:24.623 --> 30:25.956
(laughter)

30:27.760 --> 30:29.359
So, how goes the music?

30:29.428 --> 30:31.461
I'm shooting a music video
for this song called "Somber."

30:31.530 --> 30:34.631
Yeah.
And I wanted to have
Madisson in the video.

30:34.700 --> 30:36.800
And what does Camilla
think about that?
Camilla doesn't like it.

30:36.869 --> 30:38.168
She thinks, like, "Why is
your ex in the video?"

30:38.237 --> 30:39.770
Well, that makes
sense, honestly.

30:39.839 --> 30:41.104
It does make sense,
I know, and I get that.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.207
But I mean, I'm honestly
just thinking, like,

30:43.275 --> 30:45.342
I'm trying to make
the song genuine, you know?

30:45.411 --> 30:47.711
But I mean, honestly,
think about the rap game.

30:47.780 --> 30:50.214
When Jay-Z's song
where he says,

30:50.282 --> 30:51.849
"I cheated on you, Beyoncé."
Mm-hmm.

30:51.917 --> 30:53.984
He doesn't use Beyoncé
as the model in that video.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.953
I mean, like, I think--
I don't know.

30:58.791 --> 31:00.757
Then we got
into a huge fight.

31:00.826 --> 31:01.892
I know she cares about me,

31:01.961 --> 31:03.427
but like, she's been
cheated on before.

31:03.495 --> 31:05.696
But like, I'm just trying
to play the happy medium,

31:05.764 --> 31:07.164
'cause I really
care for the girl.

31:07.233 --> 31:09.900
You know, what do you
love more, Camilla
or the music?

31:10.903 --> 31:12.569
If she's not content,

31:12.638 --> 31:14.938
if she's not trustworthy
of you,

31:15.007 --> 31:16.473
then it's never gonna work.

31:27.820 --> 31:30.921

If Kelsey didn't want her
long-distance boyfriend Jacob

31:30.990 --> 31:34.091
to find out about her
dirty little secret,

31:34.159 --> 31:37.060
she never should have let him
come to Siesta Key.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.164
I'm sorry about last night.

31:41.233 --> 31:45.068
Everyone's obsessed with
getting into my personal life.

31:45.137 --> 31:48.138
And... I just wanna
be honest with you.

31:48.207 --> 31:50.507
Like, there is a lot
of rumors going around.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.911
Before you hear anything
from someone else,

31:53.979 --> 31:55.245
I need to tell you something.

31:58.817 --> 31:59.917
Okay?

31:59.985 --> 32:01.418
Brandon had his
birthday party,

32:01.487 --> 32:03.887
and it was like a bonfire,
and everyone was going.

32:03.956 --> 32:07.090
Well, towards the end,
Jared invited me

32:07.159 --> 32:10.093
to go to the beach
with him.
Ahh.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.795
He's become
really close friends

32:11.864 --> 32:14.498
with the whole entire group
this past, like, summer.

32:14.566 --> 32:17.167
And we all went
to the beach,

32:17.236 --> 32:19.703
and I had on, like,
these long pants
and everything.

32:19.772 --> 32:22.673
So, I had taken them off, but
like, left, like, my top on.

32:22.741 --> 32:25.676
And then, Jared also
took off his pants.

32:25.744 --> 32:27.110
Then...?
And I was just thinking,

32:27.179 --> 32:28.612
oh, like, we're just
having a fun time,

32:28.681 --> 32:29.947
we're like, getting
in the water and...

32:30.015 --> 32:32.649
Wait, time out.
Roll back real quick.

32:32.718 --> 32:34.084
I didn't think
anything of it,

32:34.153 --> 32:35.585
and I thought
it was totally innocent.

32:35.654 --> 32:36.853
What do you mean?

32:36.922 --> 32:38.689
I don't have any feelings
for Jared

32:38.757 --> 32:40.057
in that sort of way at all.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.359
Of course, the whole group
is making assumptions.

32:42.428 --> 32:46.997
And I'm telling you right now,
nothing else happened.

32:47.066 --> 32:50.534
And you have no idea,
like, how pissed off

32:50.602 --> 32:53.737
I am at Chloe right now for
doing this in our relationship.

32:53.806 --> 32:55.205
Yeah, but you can't
blame it on--

32:55.274 --> 32:58.342
like, as a person,
you should be able to say,

32:58.410 --> 33:00.210
like, "I'm true
to who I am."

33:00.279 --> 33:01.178
I know.

33:01.246 --> 33:03.447
You mean more to me
than anyone,

33:03.515 --> 33:05.849
and I don't wanna
ever jeopardize that.

33:05.918 --> 33:08.285

deciding to, like,

34:11.984 --> 34:14.551

34:31.703 --> 34:33.737
I don't know.

34:33.806 --> 34:36.173
I always just kinda thought,
like, we were just friends.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.408
I don't really date girls.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.180
I didn't really think
we were going out on dates.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.215
I mean, I know it was just us
one-and-one, but I go out with,

34:45.284 --> 34:46.750
you know, girlfriends
one-on-one all the time.

34:46.819 --> 34:48.218
Doesn't make it
a date to me.

34:48.287 --> 34:49.953
I've gone out one-on-one
with a lot of girls,

34:50.022 --> 34:52.789
but... we don't
make out afterwards.

34:52.858 --> 34:54.124
I like broken souls, and...

34:54.193 --> 34:56.126
Maybe that's why
you love me so much.

34:56.195 --> 34:57.761
(laughing)
Probably.

35:00.199 --> 35:02.232
It's happened a small
handful of times,

35:02.301 --> 35:04.501
and I mean, I've been
really, really drunk,

35:04.570 --> 35:05.702
and I just...

35:05.771 --> 35:07.237
So, you're using being
drunk as an excuse...

35:07.306 --> 35:08.772
I'm not--
...for leading
me on right now.

35:08.841 --> 35:10.807

35:14.580 --> 35:16.680
Typical straight girl

35:16.748 --> 35:18.648

Like, I'm finally trying

35:18.717 --> 35:20.550
to, like, open up and, like,
have a friendship
