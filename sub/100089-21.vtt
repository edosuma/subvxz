WEBVTT

00:00.086 --> 00:01.853
I hope this is enough socks.

00:01.922 --> 00:04.625
I can't stand the idea of you
at camp without enough socks.

00:04.703 --> 00:06.093
You'll call me if you run out of socks?

00:06.172 --> 00:07.656
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

00:07.723 --> 00:11.673
Second years basically live in
their space suits or jazz shoes.

00:11.743 --> 00:12.927
All right, I know I said
I wouldn't freak out

00:12.995 --> 00:14.595
about you going to
Lance Bass Space Camp this year,

00:14.673 --> 00:16.571
but I did make you this.

00:16.666 --> 00:18.552
It's a slideshow.
I'm making them for everyone.

00:18.553 --> 00:19.616
I have a talent.

00:19.641 --> 00:21.188
So this summer,
it's gonna be slideshows, huh?

00:21.213 --> 00:22.227
What's my secret?

00:22.274 --> 00:24.195
Some say order of photos,
some say it's the music,

00:24.281 --> 00:26.471
but I think it's a marriage
between the two.

00:26.533 --> 00:28.352
Plus, my transitions are fly as hell.

00:28.431 --> 00:31.499
Speaking of transitions,
I'm gonna get more socks.

00:31.568 --> 00:34.902
Wi... Wi... Wi... Wi...

00:34.971 --> 00:37.071
- Will.
- Miggy, what happened?

00:37.140 --> 00:38.506
Did my neighbor's dachshund
frighten you again?

00:38.608 --> 00:40.675
That's an element of it,
but not the whole story.

00:40.743 --> 00:43.344
Poppy just told me Angie might
live with Derek for the summer

00:43.413 --> 00:44.612
and I ran all the way here!

00:44.681 --> 00:45.713
What the hell happened?

00:45.782 --> 00:46.791
I thought you were gonna make a move!

00:46.816 --> 00:47.859
I didn't do it, okay?

00:47.884 --> 00:48.950
I drove over there,

00:49.018 --> 00:50.084
but then she hit me with
the whole Derek thing.

00:50.153 --> 00:52.620
So I drove to the beach,
I talked to a seagull,

00:52.655 --> 00:53.988
and then I got bullied
by a bunch of teens

00:54.024 --> 00:55.100
starting a bonfire.

00:55.125 --> 00:56.457
They were really mean about my beard.

00:56.526 --> 00:58.126
They called me "Father Time."

00:58.194 --> 01:00.895
Oh, that's a good burn, 'cause
it's also about your age.

01:00.964 --> 01:02.130
Anyway, I took the Derek thing as a sign

01:02.198 --> 01:03.631
that it wasn't the right moment
to talk to her.

01:03.700 --> 01:05.057
- You believe in signs?
- Are you kidding?

01:05.081 --> 01:06.041
I'm, like, Mister Signs.

01:06.080 --> 01:08.503
So there's nothing you want to
tell her before she goes?

01:08.557 --> 01:09.670
She's not going!

01:09.697 --> 01:10.845
She has to stay here with Graham.

01:10.869 --> 01:12.206
Poor kid's not going to Space Camp

01:12.275 --> 01:14.976
'cause Angie didn't sign up...
♪ By, by, by March first! ♪

01:15.078 --> 01:18.446
So it's... ♪ Bye, bye, Space Camp ♪

01:18.548 --> 01:20.014
And... ♪ Hello ♪

01:20.083 --> 01:24.118
Summer hanging with Mr....
♪ Coo-oo-oo-oo-per ♪

01:24.220 --> 01:25.153
I'm Mr. Cooper.

01:25.255 --> 01:26.487
That's the final straw.

01:26.589 --> 01:27.816
We have to start a band!

01:27.840 --> 01:29.673
Oh, man, we're going to.

01:29.759 --> 01:31.125
The point is, I'm not worried.

01:31.227 --> 01:33.594
Wi...

01:33.696 --> 01:36.964
Wi... Wi... Wi...

01:37.033 --> 01:38.833
Will!

01:38.902 --> 01:40.601
Angie, did you run here, too?

01:40.670 --> 01:42.737
Yeah, I was behind Miggy.
I saw him and got competitive.

01:42.805 --> 01:45.239
Not competitive enough.
I've been here for an hour.

01:45.341 --> 01:47.742
- You've been here for, like, a minute.
- Uh, great news!

01:47.810 --> 01:49.710
Graham got off the wait list
to space camp!

01:49.812 --> 01:51.846
Now he's gonna be gone the whole summer.

01:51.915 --> 01:54.182
So, uh, does that mean that
I should go live with Derek?

01:54.250 --> 01:55.816
I... It seems like a sign.

01:55.885 --> 01:57.585
Ahh, signs.

01:57.687 --> 01:59.253
I don't really believe in those.

01:59.322 --> 02:00.855
Really? You just told me
you were Mister S...

02:00.957 --> 02:02.323
Shut up.

02:02.392 --> 02:03.791
- Mister Si...
- Shut up.

02:03.860 --> 02:05.893
- Mister...
- Yeah, you don't want it.

02:05.950 --> 02:07.628
- No, he... No, what are you doing?
- No, sorry, she was saying.

02:07.676 --> 02:08.863
That's so weird. You just...

02:09.999 --> 02:11.966
- But you...
- It's all right. Finish.

02:12.035 --> 02:13.668
- You just said you were Mister S...
- Shut up!

02:20.510 --> 02:22.343
Ah, ah, ah! Hold up.

02:22.445 --> 02:23.644
I knock now.

02:23.746 --> 02:25.479
Like some common trick-or-treater?

02:25.582 --> 02:28.182
No, like a woman who's dropping
off her kid for a playdate

02:28.284 --> 02:30.418
at the home of a man
she's no longer dating.

02:30.520 --> 02:32.587
I realize that made it sound
like the playdate's with the man

02:32.689 --> 02:33.988
and not his kids, but you get it.

02:34.090 --> 02:36.490
What I get is that ever since
you and Douglas broke up,

02:36.593 --> 02:37.725
you treat each other like

02:37.827 --> 02:39.694
two co-workers talking in an elevator.

02:39.796 --> 02:41.062
"Nice weekend, Douglas?"

02:41.164 --> 02:42.997
"Oh, yes, thank you. And yours?"

02:43.099 --> 02:45.633
"Yes, lovely.
Sure went by fast, though."

02:45.735 --> 02:47.301
"Don't they always?" "Ha ha ha."

02:47.403 --> 02:49.503
"Ha ha ha." Blechhh, splat, snore!

02:49.606 --> 02:53.407
That was me barfing and then
falling asleep in my own barf.

02:53.509 --> 02:56.110
Because first it's gross,
and then it's boring.

02:56.212 --> 02:58.145
Look, I know it's not the saucy
back and forth

02:58.248 --> 03:00.081
of romance-era Poppy-Douglas

03:00.183 --> 03:02.516
or the crackle of pre-romance,

03:02.619 --> 03:04.151
peak-friendship Poppy-Douglas,

03:04.254 --> 03:06.887
but now with this many feelings
involved, just...

03:06.990 --> 03:08.556
Polite is where you want to be.

03:08.658 --> 03:10.324
Can you at least do a fun knock?

03:10.426 --> 03:13.160
Absolutely not.

03:16.633 --> 03:18.199
Poppy.

03:19.636 --> 03:21.502
Looking well.

03:21.604 --> 03:23.371
As are you.

03:23.473 --> 03:25.139
As are you.

03:25.241 --> 03:27.508
Gas prices are crazy, huh?

03:27.610 --> 03:29.210
Crazy.

03:29.312 --> 03:31.412
Just crazy.

03:33.516 --> 03:35.583
You know,
there's a squirrel in your yard.

03:35.685 --> 03:38.552
Yeah. He's hanging out.

03:38.655 --> 03:41.589
Oh. Squirrels.

03:42.859 --> 03:44.125
Storing up.

03:44.227 --> 03:45.426
Winter.

03:45.495 --> 03:47.194
We have to do something.

03:47.297 --> 03:49.597
My mom and your dad, they've become...

03:49.699 --> 03:50.765
they've become...

03:50.867 --> 03:52.900
Damn it, girls,
they've become un-watchable!

03:53.002 --> 03:53.968
I know!

03:54.070 --> 03:55.536
If I hear either of them say,

03:55.605 --> 03:57.004
"How's business going?" again,

03:57.073 --> 03:58.105
I'll climb in the oven.

03:58.174 --> 03:59.640
There's only one way to get them to act

03:59.709 --> 04:01.742
like their fiery selves again
and get them back together.

04:01.844 --> 04:03.311
Don't say we "Parent Trap" them.

04:03.379 --> 04:05.713
As twins, we have
very complicated feelings

04:05.782 --> 04:08.149
about that film
and the way it portrays us.

04:08.251 --> 04:09.817
And our powers.

04:09.886 --> 04:11.252
"Parent Trap" them?

04:11.321 --> 04:14.055
Who am I, First Thought Johnny
and the Uptown Cornballs? No!

04:14.157 --> 04:15.990
We do something no one
has ever thought of doing

04:16.091 --> 04:17.391
to get an ex fired up.

04:17.493 --> 04:18.759
We get them...

04:18.861 --> 04:21.195
to make each other...

04:21.264 --> 04:22.263
jealous.

04:23.866 --> 04:25.348
Does your dad have an Instagram account?

04:29.672 --> 04:31.372
No, but seriously, though,
we have to make one for him.

04:31.441 --> 04:33.341
Welcome!

04:33.443 --> 04:35.910
Look to the person on your left.

04:36.012 --> 04:38.346
Now look to the person on your right.

04:38.414 --> 04:40.715
Wow, Lance has really
toughened up this year.

04:40.817 --> 04:41.982
At the end of the summer,

04:42.051 --> 04:44.819
all of you will still be here

04:44.921 --> 04:45.886
because your parents paid.

04:45.988 --> 04:47.788
But you will be different.

04:47.857 --> 04:51.859
You will be astronauts
with all-star vibrato.

04:51.961 --> 04:53.761
Now, all together.

04:53.863 --> 04:56.597
♪ Mommy, may I please go to the moon? ♪

04:56.666 --> 04:59.667
♪ Mommy, may I please go to the moon? ♪

04:59.736 --> 05:01.502
That was all wrong, but we'll find it.

05:01.604 --> 05:03.037
- Get on the bus.
- I'm friends with him.

05:03.139 --> 05:04.205
I know, Will.

05:04.307 --> 05:05.239
We all know.

05:05.341 --> 05:09.510
So, where are we on the big Barstow Q?

05:09.579 --> 05:12.513
The Big B. Q? BBQ?

05:12.582 --> 05:13.547
I'm torn still.

05:13.616 --> 05:14.949
I mean, I'm kid-free for the summer,

05:15.017 --> 05:16.083
so that really frees me up,

05:16.152 --> 05:18.085
but there's still
things keeping me here.

05:18.187 --> 05:19.387
I mean, that's true.

05:19.489 --> 05:21.455
What, are you just gonna bail
on your Y membership?

05:21.524 --> 05:23.320
Who's gonna scatter 5-pound
weights across the floor?

05:23.345 --> 05:24.367
Plus, there's my job

05:24.391 --> 05:25.546
where I'm clearly very important.

05:25.571 --> 05:27.474
They won't stop calling me. Ignore.

05:27.515 --> 05:29.964
So, seems like you got it figured out.

05:30.032 --> 05:31.298
No Barstow.

05:31.401 --> 05:33.567
You want to go to a candy store,
get some weird Japanese stuff?

05:33.636 --> 05:34.835
But I was kind of looking forward

05:34.904 --> 05:36.270
to spending the summer with Derek.

05:36.339 --> 05:38.401
I mean, I know it's not how
your typical love story goes...

05:38.456 --> 05:40.808
meet, do it, baby,
nine years of silence,

05:40.877 --> 05:42.076
then move in together.

05:42.178 --> 05:44.145
Yeah, when you put it that way,
it sounds pretty terrible.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.579
So, Japanese candy time?

05:45.681 --> 05:47.481
But then again,
maybe this is the universe

05:47.550 --> 05:48.783
giving us one last chance

05:48.885 --> 05:50.284
to figure out if we can be a family.

05:50.353 --> 05:52.358
Ugh! It's my boss again.

05:52.397 --> 05:54.088
God, you take one six-hour lunch break

05:54.190 --> 05:55.222
and the whole place falls apart!

05:55.324 --> 05:56.824
What?!

05:56.926 --> 05:58.292
Hey, Graham.

05:58.361 --> 06:00.261
Did you just get off the bus
and no one stopped you?

06:00.363 --> 06:03.230
- That worries me.
- I-I forgot to ask.

06:03.299 --> 06:04.865
Would you take care of my mom
this summer?

06:04.934 --> 06:07.001
You know, make sure she eats,
opens her mail,

06:07.069 --> 06:09.703
- doesn't burn down the house again.
- I'm on it, little G.

06:09.772 --> 06:11.772
This is the summer
I throw out that printer.

06:11.874 --> 06:12.973
Oh, actually, I'm glad you're here

06:13.075 --> 06:14.708
because... made you a slideshow.

06:14.777 --> 06:16.110
Yussss!

06:16.212 --> 06:17.945
Please let it be set to Green Day.

06:18.014 --> 06:20.080
Well, let's just say you'll have the...

06:20.149 --> 06:21.816
time of your life.

06:21.918 --> 06:23.317
God, you're good.

06:23.386 --> 06:25.219
D'Amato, on the bus!

06:25.288 --> 06:26.754
I need you seated with the baritones!

06:26.823 --> 06:28.322
- Bye, buddy.
- Bye-bye. Gotta go.

06:28.391 --> 06:30.391
All right, time for the candy store?

06:30.493 --> 06:32.159
I just got fired.

06:32.261 --> 06:34.662
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

06:34.764 --> 06:36.764
Yeah. Actually, I am.

06:36.866 --> 06:38.199
I mean, I was looking for signs,

06:38.301 --> 06:40.868
and, well, this seems like a big one.

06:40.970 --> 06:42.770
I think...

06:42.839 --> 06:44.605
I'm gonna spend the summer with Derek.

06:48.578 --> 06:50.211
All right, almost done with creating

06:50.279 --> 06:54.148
my Instagram masterpiece,
@TheRealDoctorDouglasFogerty.

06:54.217 --> 06:56.717
Now all we need is some pics of
Douglas living his best life.

06:56.786 --> 06:59.987
Any chance you have any shots
of your dad in a soapy tub?

07:00.056 --> 07:01.088
Get with it.

07:01.157 --> 07:02.923
Dad hasn't had pics taken of him
in a decade.

07:02.992 --> 07:04.992
Okay, guess we'll
just have to build this baby

07:05.094 --> 07:06.160
from the ground up.

07:06.229 --> 07:07.828
Amy, roust him, please.

07:07.930 --> 07:08.963
Dad!

07:10.566 --> 07:11.532
Dad?

07:11.634 --> 07:12.566
Dad!!

07:12.668 --> 07:13.601
What?!

07:13.669 --> 07:15.102
Can you tell me about the time

07:15.171 --> 07:16.937
that you met Don Rickles
at the Pavillions?

07:17.039 --> 07:19.540
What an entertainer.

07:19.609 --> 07:21.008
This is gold. Start snapping.

07:21.077 --> 07:24.111
He insulted my pants,
and I loved him for it.

07:24.180 --> 07:25.246
You know what he said to me?

07:25.314 --> 07:26.647
"Let's put an elevator in your butt

07:26.716 --> 07:27.850
and make you a building."

07:30.887 --> 07:32.520
Huh! Would you look at that.

07:32.622 --> 07:33.888
Douglas is on Instagram.

07:33.990 --> 07:36.190
What? Let me see that.

07:38.361 --> 07:39.527
Uh-huh.

07:39.629 --> 07:40.961
Mm-hmm.

07:41.063 --> 07:42.096
Okay.

07:42.198 --> 07:43.464
Every time I wanted to go dancing,

07:43.566 --> 07:44.598
he was all "My knees hurt."

07:44.700 --> 07:45.699
Well, good for him!

07:45.801 --> 07:47.234
- Our fish is nibbling.
- Hm!

07:47.336 --> 07:48.269
Time to reel her in.

07:50.673 --> 07:53.908

07:54.010 --> 07:55.809
Okay.

07:55.912 --> 07:57.745
Meet Douglas' newest lady friend,

07:57.847 --> 07:59.446
@BethanyGummiBear.

07:59.549 --> 08:03.117
Bad attitude, worse bangs,
but one hell of a good time.

08:03.219 --> 08:05.019
Amy, get ready to caption.

08:06.422 --> 08:09.623
"Celebrating three days
with this dork," period.

08:09.725 --> 08:12.459
"Am I dreaming," question mark.

08:12.562 --> 08:13.994
Smiley face emoji...

08:14.096 --> 08:15.563
devil horns emoji...

08:15.665 --> 08:16.764
salsa dancer...

08:16.866 --> 08:19.400
and post!

08:19.502 --> 08:22.484
Who the hell is Bethany Gummi Bear?!

08:23.784 --> 08:24.808
Mig...

08:24.833 --> 08:25.816
Mi... Mi...

08:28.377 --> 08:30.578
Miggy! Something happened.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.780
I know! Today's the day
we all started running!

08:32.881 --> 08:34.481
Must be that runnin' moon.

08:34.583 --> 08:36.350
Angie has decided to move
to Barstow with Derek.

08:36.452 --> 08:37.484
We have to stop her!

08:37.587 --> 08:39.186
We can't let our friend
make a crazy decision

08:39.288 --> 08:40.321
just because she got fired!

08:40.423 --> 08:41.621
Angie got fired from the law firm?

08:41.724 --> 08:44.024
Was it because she kept taking
naps on the lobby couch?

08:44.126 --> 08:46.260
I told her she was flying
too close to the sun.

08:46.362 --> 08:47.528
She can't go.

08:47.630 --> 08:49.129
I mean, I know she's saying
it's just for the summer,

08:49.231 --> 08:50.664
but what if she never comes back?

08:50.766 --> 08:52.232
You know she has an inertia issue.

08:52.335 --> 08:54.501
She still wears a toe ring that
she got in the eighth grade!

08:54.604 --> 08:55.769
I love your energy, bro.

08:55.871 --> 08:57.671
I do not know what inertia is,
but I'm with you.

08:57.773 --> 08:59.708
- What's the plan?
- We got to get her job back.

08:59.794 --> 09:01.241
I don't know how,
but we'll figure it out

09:01.344 --> 09:02.743
on the way to the office. Let's roll.

09:02.845 --> 09:04.478
Okay. Cool. I'm gonna go put on
my sweats and running sneaks.

09:04.580 --> 09:05.879
Miggy, we're gonna drive.

09:05.982 --> 09:07.468
Thank God. I can't run any more today.

09:07.538 --> 09:09.561
My knees be jello!

09:11.179 --> 09:14.173
Bethany Gummi Bear,
this candy-ass thot...

09:15.240 --> 09:16.907
- Hm.
- She's freaking out.

09:16.995 --> 09:18.142
Do you smell that?

09:18.220 --> 09:19.696
I think she just had a cigarette.

09:19.806 --> 09:22.001
Hey, girls. Can I ask you a question?

09:22.071 --> 09:24.968
Your dad, has he been
spending a lot of time out?

09:25.036 --> 09:26.169
With people?

09:26.238 --> 09:27.317
Bra people?

09:27.394 --> 09:29.594
Oh, yeah. He's living his best life.

09:29.649 --> 09:31.549
Ohh! Good.

09:31.617 --> 09:33.183
You okay, Poppy?

09:33.286 --> 09:35.119
Yeah. Yeah.

09:35.221 --> 09:36.620
Yeah.

09:36.722 --> 09:38.689
Yeah!

09:38.791 --> 09:40.157
It's working!

09:40.226 --> 09:42.159
Now we move on
to making Douglas jealous.

09:42.228 --> 09:43.294
But how do we get to him?

09:43.362 --> 09:45.563
He barely uses technology.

09:52.538 --> 09:53.737
Just Poppy and I,

09:53.806 --> 09:56.006
we... we used to
spend every day together.

09:56.075 --> 09:57.908
And then she... she wanted a baby,

09:57.977 --> 10:00.945
and I didn't, and now
it's like we're total strangers.

10:01.914 --> 10:04.882
Ah, love is a cruel mistress, huh, Tony?

10:04.951 --> 10:07.117
Well, at least you and I
are solid, right?

10:07.186 --> 10:08.980
Uh... Uh... My show's on.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.473
<i>This is KPJZ,</i>

10:10.527 --> 10:12.356
<i>your favorite spot for undervalued jazz.</i>

10:12.458 --> 10:14.224

10:16.662 --> 10:19.163
Oh, Shippy. The Lord took him too soon.

10:20.099 --> 10:21.799
It's a fast life behind the horn.

10:21.878 --> 10:23.801
<i>Our next song is a request by Vince</i>

10:23.903 --> 10:25.190

10:25.276 --> 10:27.371

10:34.680 --> 10:36.413

10:36.515 --> 10:37.781
<i>And now, dedicated to Poppy,</i>

10:37.850 --> 10:39.917
<i>"Night Petting" by Dimp Hoolihan.</i>

10:42.555 --> 10:45.990
I need some time to sweat by myself.

10:46.092 --> 10:49.152
Give me 10 minutes and come back
with my sad olives.

10:54.634 --> 10:58.802
No, I'll see you on the green, Louis!

10:58.871 --> 11:00.938
How'd it go? Did you talk
to your boss about Angie?

11:00.963 --> 11:02.095
Yeah, I couldn't get her job back.

11:02.145 --> 11:04.708
- What?
- But great news... I got a promotion!

11:04.777 --> 11:06.210
I'm leveling up, my man.

11:06.312 --> 11:08.161
Okay, clearly I'm the one
that has to deal with this.

11:08.216 --> 11:10.171
- Move aside.
- Wait, fine. But if my boss asks,

11:10.247 --> 11:12.583
I got my MBA from Yale.

11:12.685 --> 11:14.752
Wh...

11:14.854 --> 11:15.986
Shut up.

11:16.088 --> 11:17.788
All right, Angie's boss, I'm Will Coo...

11:17.890 --> 11:21.125
Wow. This is not what I was expecting.

11:21.227 --> 11:22.626
Whole lot of men in suits.

11:22.728 --> 11:26.363
Sorry, I see that some of you are women.
Very beautiful women.

11:26.432 --> 11:27.564
No, shouldn't have said that...

11:27.633 --> 11:29.133
that is very disrespectful.

11:29.201 --> 11:31.969
I know what I'm saying,
and I hear how bad it is.

11:32.038 --> 11:34.571
Oh! We doing a slideshow?

11:39.178 --> 11:40.411
Hello.

11:40.513 --> 11:42.312
Douglas.

11:42.415 --> 11:43.947
Night has fallen.

11:44.050 --> 11:46.183
I noticed. It's dark.

11:46.252 --> 11:48.385
I'm here to collect the girls.

11:48.487 --> 11:50.521
I can wait outside if you want.

11:50.589 --> 11:51.622
Oh, no. I mean,
unless you're in a hurry.

11:51.691 --> 11:53.724
- You have big plans?
- No.

11:53.826 --> 11:56.593
No, I just didn't want to get in the way

11:56.696 --> 11:59.196
if you had... company.

11:59.265 --> 12:01.532
Uh-huh.

12:03.169 --> 12:04.401
Who the hell is Bethany Gummi Bear?!

12:04.503 --> 12:07.004
Who's Vince, and why are you
delicately Frenching him?!

12:07.106 --> 12:08.939
Vince?

12:09.008 --> 12:10.574
And now to complete the love triangle.

12:10.643 --> 12:14.545
A delicious complication for
Douglas and Bethany Gummi Bear.

12:14.647 --> 12:17.347
Enter TiffanyYumYum8.

12:17.416 --> 12:19.683
Doesn't Yum Yum step on Gummi Bear?

12:19.785 --> 12:23.320
Amy, you're off the keys.
Emma, Tiffany's talking to me.

12:23.422 --> 12:24.755
Type.

12:24.857 --> 12:26.423
"Douglas," comma.

12:26.525 --> 12:29.059
"When are you coming around
again," question mark.

12:29.128 --> 12:32.196
"My dog Banjo,
he... he really misses you."

12:32.264 --> 12:35.132
Shooting star emoji, firework emoji.

12:35.234 --> 12:37.578
"If you don't respond,
I'll hurt myself." And post!

12:44.130 --> 12:45.309
Will, I'm so glad you're here.

12:45.377 --> 12:47.311
Do you think I'm gonna need
this horse mask in Barstow?

12:47.413 --> 12:49.413
What am I saying?
Of course I'm gonna need it.

12:49.515 --> 12:51.315
What I if want to go
into town unnoticed?

12:51.383 --> 12:53.150
Uhh, looks like you haven't really

12:53.252 --> 12:55.137
- made a dent in your packing.
- It's fine.

12:55.215 --> 12:56.590
Derek isn't coming till 9:00 a.m.,

12:56.668 --> 12:58.388
so time to channel Teen Angie D'Amato,

12:58.457 --> 12:59.690
pull an all-nighter.

12:59.792 --> 13:02.259
Step one... find my bag
with all my bags in it.

13:02.328 --> 13:03.594
Well, it's actually good
you're not packed,

13:03.662 --> 13:06.330
because, uh... you're not going.

13:06.432 --> 13:08.198
I got you your job back.

13:13.038 --> 13:14.638
- You did what?
- Let's just say

13:14.707 --> 13:16.707
I had a little impromptu chat
with the board,

13:16.809 --> 13:19.576
and also I dropped some serious
slideshow knowledge on them,

13:19.645 --> 13:21.945
'cause here's the thing...
the real slideshow happens

13:22.047 --> 13:24.748
- in the moments between the slides.
- Great!

13:24.817 --> 13:26.316
Well, since you know your way
around my office,

13:26.418 --> 13:28.385
now you can go back and get me re-fired.

13:28.487 --> 13:30.039
What? Why?

13:30.094 --> 13:33.757
Because you majorly overstepped, dude.

13:33.859 --> 13:35.859
Getting fired is my business!

13:35.961 --> 13:37.928
It was the one area of my life
you hadn't weighed in on.

13:38.030 --> 13:40.197
Okay, but your life is here,

13:40.266 --> 13:41.698
and that job
is how you pay for this life.

13:41.767 --> 13:43.100
So, I thought you'd be happy.

13:43.169 --> 13:44.468
Oh, I am the opposite of happy!

13:44.537 --> 13:46.436
- Horny?
- No!

13:46.505 --> 13:48.405
You think happy and horny are opposites?

13:48.507 --> 13:49.506
That's so sad!

13:49.608 --> 13:50.974
No, I'm mad!

13:51.076 --> 13:52.943
Angie, I'm just trying
to look out for you, okay?

13:53.012 --> 13:55.112
Oh, I know you are. You always are!

13:55.181 --> 13:57.014
You're constantly telling me
how to live a better life.

13:57.116 --> 13:58.582
"Learn guitar, Angie."

13:58.684 --> 14:00.017
"Don't date the cheating Brit, Angie."

14:00.119 --> 14:02.386
"Tell that woman you backed
into her van, Angie."

14:02.488 --> 14:04.955
- Because it was Poppy!
- You made me this person...

14:05.057 --> 14:08.258
this gross person
who wants more for herself.

14:08.327 --> 14:09.259
You're the one who always said

14:09.328 --> 14:10.894
that I should go for a job that I love.

14:10.996 --> 14:12.229
Well, now I can do that.

14:12.331 --> 14:14.665
I was actually gonna
take some courses in Barstow!

14:14.767 --> 14:16.366
- What courses?
- Shut up!

14:16.435 --> 14:18.035
I made this decision.

14:18.103 --> 14:20.838
I am taking a chance
on me and my happiness,

14:20.906 --> 14:22.239
and now you want me to stop.

14:22.308 --> 14:25.342
I just think you're
making a terrible mistake.

14:25.411 --> 14:27.010
The elder nudity in Barstow

14:27.079 --> 14:28.478
isn't even as bad as they say it is.

14:28.581 --> 14:29.780
It's not that!

14:29.882 --> 14:32.683
Although I'd argue any
elderly nudity is a red flag.

14:32.751 --> 14:34.318
Then what is this about?

14:34.386 --> 14:36.753
Derek? You hate his hot, stupid guts.

14:36.856 --> 14:37.988
- Just admit it!
- Admit it?

14:38.090 --> 14:39.489
I have been very open

14:39.592 --> 14:41.725
about how much I hate
his hot, stupid guts.

14:41.794 --> 14:43.627
- I beat him up for you!
- It was a draw.

14:43.711 --> 14:45.911
- Oh, d... I kicked his ass!
- You know what?

14:45.998 --> 14:47.779
LA costs a billion dollars,

14:47.867 --> 14:50.067
and my super-cool horse mask
is already in this box.

14:50.135 --> 14:52.269
There's nothing keeping me here.

14:52.338 --> 14:54.738
I have no meaningful roots.

14:56.208 --> 14:58.342
No meaningful roots? Really?

14:58.410 --> 15:00.644
What about our group of friends?

15:00.746 --> 15:02.212
What...

15:02.314 --> 15:03.347
What about me?

15:03.415 --> 15:06.383
I'm figuring it out, okay?
This is all confusing.

15:06.485 --> 15:08.352
Derek is confusing.

15:08.454 --> 15:10.087
You're confusing.

15:10.189 --> 15:12.589
I just... I just need
to follow the signs.

15:12.691 --> 15:14.658
You can't leave a decision this big

15:14.760 --> 15:17.261
to some imaginary message from the sky.

15:17.363 --> 15:18.495
The universe would disagree.

15:18.597 --> 15:19.997
Okay, universe. Give us a sign.

15:20.099 --> 15:22.299
Should Angie go to Barstow?

15:22.401 --> 15:24.268
See?

15:24.370 --> 15:26.737
You're not gonna be able to
outsource this one to fate.

15:26.839 --> 15:28.906
You're gonna have to make your
own decision, and you know why?

15:29.008 --> 15:31.177
Because there is no such thing as signs.

15:34.179 --> 15:36.434
Well, that was an
unfortunately timed coincidence.

15:37.192 --> 15:38.942
So, you were trying to
get us back together?

15:39.028 --> 15:40.934
- You were "Parent Trap'ing" us?
- Whoa!

15:41.013 --> 15:43.493
- Poppy!
- Look, I'm on your side, but it's 2020.

15:43.550 --> 15:45.316
You don't say that to twins.

15:45.407 --> 15:46.673
We were trying to make you jealous.

15:46.742 --> 15:48.608
So, yeah, we called
that creepy radio station.

15:48.677 --> 15:50.838
And, yes, we made up Bethany Gummi Bear.

15:50.924 --> 15:52.512
We had a whole arc planned for her.

15:52.614 --> 15:54.648
- She was gonna get her GED.
- We didn't agree on that.

15:54.717 --> 15:56.683
Part of her allure
was that she was uneducated.

15:56.752 --> 15:58.285
Look, you can't manipulate people

15:58.387 --> 15:59.653
and force them to get back together.

15:59.722 --> 16:01.621
Yeah, Poppy's right. This is between us.

16:01.690 --> 16:03.223
And by the way,
I would never date anyone

16:03.292 --> 16:05.258
who didn't have at least
an associate's degree.

16:05.361 --> 16:06.827
But we're a part of this, too.

16:06.929 --> 16:09.096
We've been there every step of the way.

16:09.198 --> 16:11.164
When do we get our say?

16:11.233 --> 16:13.100
You don't, okay? I'm sorry.

16:13.202 --> 16:15.602
Look, I know it doesn't
seem fair, but the truth is

16:15.704 --> 16:17.571
that, uh, Poppy and I are...

16:17.639 --> 16:19.139
just gonna be friends for now.

16:19.208 --> 16:21.308
But it doesn't seem like
you guys are friends.

16:21.377 --> 16:23.443
You only talk about squirrel sightings.

16:23.512 --> 16:27.014
Yeah, and pretty soon,
you guys won't talk at all.

16:28.851 --> 16:30.917
That's a meaningful look!
You two both saw that.

16:31.020 --> 16:33.520
We struck a nerve.
Now we can't get in trouble.

16:33.589 --> 16:34.688
We'll be waiting in the car.

16:34.757 --> 16:36.408
Wait, we're not finished here.

16:36.494 --> 16:38.325
- Look, I...
- Yeah.

16:38.427 --> 16:39.860
Okay.

16:41.163 --> 16:42.162
Okay, so I know that

16:42.231 --> 16:44.498
Tiffany Yum Yum 8 is totally made up,

16:44.566 --> 16:48.135
but you would not believe what
this crazy B's got going on.

16:49.705 --> 16:51.638
What the hell happened?

16:51.707 --> 16:53.940
Did you leave a curling iron on
somewhere or something?

16:54.043 --> 16:55.008
Yes, Will.

16:55.110 --> 16:56.243
I left my curling iron on

16:56.345 --> 16:58.245
and short-circuited the entire house.

16:58.313 --> 17:01.415
No, obviously, I had
the power company stop service

17:01.483 --> 17:02.682
since I'm leaving tomorrow.

17:02.751 --> 17:05.385
I don't want my dumb subletter
mooching off of me.

17:05.454 --> 17:07.287
I just didn't realize
when the power company said

17:07.356 --> 17:11.290
"losing power at 9:00,"
they meant, like, at 9:00.

17:11.359 --> 17:12.526
I think I found a flashlight.

17:12.627 --> 17:15.262
Nope. Just a hidden bottle of wine.

17:15.338 --> 17:16.775
Oh, here we go. No.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.060
Another bottle.

17:18.099 --> 17:19.532
You know, for someone
whose house just burned down,

17:19.601 --> 17:21.068
you are ill-prepared for an emergency.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.270
You can't prepare for an emergency.

17:23.338 --> 17:25.137
Then it's not an emergency.

17:25.240 --> 17:27.540
Ooh! Found my candles.

17:28.777 --> 17:30.143
I love this one...

17:30.212 --> 17:32.679
Evil Gingerbread Surprise.

17:34.049 --> 17:36.750
Oh, my God. That smells terrible.

17:36.819 --> 17:39.553
I get all my candles at the
holiday section at gas stations.

17:39.621 --> 17:41.755
Cheesy Peppermint Mocha,

17:41.857 --> 17:42.956
Turkey Balsam Fir,

17:43.058 --> 17:46.059
or Reindeer Musk?

17:46.161 --> 17:47.694
Hell, I'm in.

17:53.635 --> 17:54.835
I'm sorry.

17:54.903 --> 17:58.138
I should not have tried to
puppet-master your decision.

17:58.207 --> 18:02.242
And if you want to give it
a second chance with Derek,

18:02.311 --> 18:03.743
I support that.

18:05.013 --> 18:06.780
I just want you to be happy.

18:06.882 --> 18:08.181
Thank you.

18:09.518 --> 18:13.787
And I'm sorry that I said
I have no reason to stay here.

18:13.856 --> 18:16.756
You're a really amazing friend.

18:16.859 --> 18:18.346
It's too bad I'm a Barstow bitch now.

18:18.427 --> 18:20.307
You're gonna make
the best Barstow bitch.

18:20.331 --> 18:21.362
Right?

18:21.363 --> 18:23.864
So, it's our last night together.

18:23.966 --> 18:26.700
I guess we'll be
spending it in the dark.

18:26.768 --> 18:30.003
Well, we could make our way
through my living room wine.

18:30.105 --> 18:31.771
We don't have to paw around
looking for a bottle opener

18:31.874 --> 18:34.574
- because twist-offs rule.
- They truly do.

18:39.214 --> 18:40.313
Okay, that one's yours.

18:43.585 --> 18:44.851
To our last night.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.453
To our last night.

18:46.522 --> 18:48.555
And...

18:48.624 --> 18:51.424
my one meaningful root.

18:55.731 --> 18:57.297
Hmm.

19:02.337 --> 19:04.638
- Hey.
- Hey, Douglas.

19:04.706 --> 19:07.641
Um, look, I-I was thinking
about what the kids said,

19:07.743 --> 19:09.809
and I kind of think they have a point.

19:09.912 --> 19:12.646
Yeah, me too.

19:12.714 --> 19:14.281
<i>I mean, I'm still punishing Rory.</i>

19:14.383 --> 19:15.782
Took away his karaoke machine.

19:15.884 --> 19:17.539
If he wants to sing,
it's gotta be a cappella.

19:17.564 --> 19:18.586
<i>Oh, you went easy on him.</i>

19:18.641 --> 19:20.446
I pulled out the big guns.

19:20.522 --> 19:21.922
I'm making them watch "Parent Trap."

19:22.024 --> 19:23.690
Can we turn this crap off?

19:23.792 --> 19:25.091
You'll watch the whole thing!

19:25.194 --> 19:26.760
This is a hate crime!

19:26.828 --> 19:29.930
<i>Look, I... I still
want us to be friends.</i>

19:29.998 --> 19:32.866
And not just fake friends

19:32.935 --> 19:34.868
who only talk about the weather.

19:34.970 --> 19:36.369
<i>Yeah, can we do that?</i>

19:36.471 --> 19:38.605
I don't know. We can try.

19:38.707 --> 19:39.873
What'd we used to do?

19:39.942 --> 19:41.608
Well, I think we just
used to think of stuff

19:41.710 --> 19:44.845
and say it out loud.

19:45.981 --> 19:48.148
How you doing?

19:48.250 --> 19:49.516
Honestly? Lousy.

19:49.618 --> 19:51.918
<i>Oh, thank God. I can't even sleep.</i>

19:52.020 --> 19:53.954
You know I started watching "Frasier"?

19:54.056 --> 19:55.488
Really? You hate that show.

19:55.591 --> 19:58.058
Yeah, but it's starting to grow on me.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.326
Hey, here's a question...

19:59.428 --> 20:02.429
uh, do Niles and Frasier
ever get together?

20:02.531 --> 20:03.530
<i>They're brothers.</i>

20:03.632 --> 20:06.099
Ah. Oh. Okay, well...

20:06.201 --> 20:07.601
Still a pretty good show.

20:07.703 --> 20:09.102
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:09.204 --> 20:10.437
Now your turn.

20:23.885 --> 20:26.492
- Oh, my gaaah!
- What the ass!

21:26.798 --> 21:28.860
<i>This next dedication goes out to Vince</i>

21:28.945 --> 21:31.156
<i>from a new listener, Bethany Gummi Bear.</i>

21:31.242 --> 21:32.875
<i>"Vince, I wouldn't
trade our time together</i>

21:32.961 --> 21:34.414
<i>for anything in the world.</i>

21:34.446 --> 21:36.180
<i>Even that day I found out
our friend had sex</i>

21:36.248 --> 21:37.447
<i>with your secret son.</i>

21:37.545 --> 21:39.115
<i>Anyway, you'll always be in my heart,</i>

21:39.151 --> 21:40.568
<i>and I'll always love you."</i>

21:40.646 --> 21:43.187
<i>Now here's "Frost Smitten"
by the sludge man himself,</i>

21:43.256 --> 21:44.545
<i>Fat Jake Lungtug.</i>

21:47.952 --> 21:49.151
You knew Lungtug.

21:49.253 --> 21:51.053
Before he hammered that hippie to death.

21:51.155 --> 21:52.392
You know, for another time.

21:52.456 --> 21:53.860
Let's just enjoy this.

21:58.913 --> 22:03.905
