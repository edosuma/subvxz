00:01.610 --> 00:03.003
<i>Previously on
"Alaska Daily"...</i>

00:03.003 --> 00:04.743
I might have something
on the Gloria Nanmac story.

00:04.743 --> 00:07.050
- Her name was Alice Porter.
- Who is she?

00:07.050 --> 00:08.747
A friend of Gloria's,
from church I believe.

00:08.747 --> 00:10.010
Spoke to Alice Porter.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.098
She confirmed
that she and Gloria

00:11.098 --> 00:12.534
knew each other
from church.

00:12.534 --> 00:14.971
The pastor's name
is Reed Gallahorn.

00:14.971 --> 00:16.190
Why does that
sound familiar?

00:16.190 --> 00:18.061
It sounds like
"Rega Horne."

00:18.061 --> 00:21.021
You think "Rega Horne" is
a misspelling of Reed Gallahorn?

00:21.021 --> 00:24.589
If so, why is a pastor's
name on a police report?

00:25.764 --> 00:26.939
Eileen.

00:26.939 --> 00:28.332
Concerned Citizen.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.509
Sit down.

00:31.509 --> 00:33.033
<i>There's a gunman
in the newsroom.</i>

00:33.033 --> 00:34.686
<i>He's taken
Eileen hostage.</i>

00:34.686 --> 00:36.688
Gabriel's hiding
in the Morgue.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.212
Stop lying to me!

00:39.822 --> 00:42.607
<i>He's coming for me.</i>

00:42.607 --> 00:44.870
<i>It feels like
we're coming to the end here.</i>

00:44.870 --> 00:47.221
<i>No one's been hurt, which means
you can walk out that door</i>

00:47.221 --> 00:49.353
and not give away
your entire future.

00:49.353 --> 00:50.441
What future?

00:50.441 --> 00:51.747
Eric,
where are you going?

01:03.498 --> 01:05.891
I'm glad you're here, Eileen.

01:07.763 --> 01:08.938
Stanley wouldn't let me
go back to work

01:08.938 --> 01:11.506
until I talked
to someone.

01:11.506 --> 01:15.162
You. So here I am. Talking.

01:15.162 --> 01:18.078
Tell me what you've been doing
since the event.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.863
I've been spending a lot of time
at the Captain Cook gym.

01:20.863 --> 01:22.125
Good sauna.

01:22.125 --> 01:25.650
I haven't been sleeping.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.087
I tried to work
on my book,

01:27.087 --> 01:29.698
but I'm having
a hard time focusing.

01:29.698 --> 01:31.917
I just need to get back
in the newsroom. I'll be fine.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.876
It's only been
three days.

01:33.876 --> 01:36.487
What you experienced
was very traumatic.

01:36.487 --> 01:39.969
I was embedded
in Afghanistan.

01:39.969 --> 01:42.276
Did you seek treatment
after that?

01:42.276 --> 01:43.712
No.

01:45.975 --> 01:48.934
Is that
the wrong answer?

01:48.934 --> 01:51.981
I'm not sure.

01:51.981 --> 01:55.680
Some common symptoms of
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder

01:55.680 --> 01:58.857
are insomnia,
loss of appetite,

01:58.857 --> 02:01.643
and sometimes
panic attacks.

02:05.995 --> 02:08.128
Did you experience
a panic attack?

02:08.128 --> 02:09.999
I have.

02:09.999 --> 02:11.566
Since you were
taken hostage?

02:11.566 --> 02:14.003
No. Before.

02:14.003 --> 02:18.181
When I first came to Alaska.
No offense.

02:18.181 --> 02:19.530
Where were you
when you had it?

02:19.530 --> 02:21.445
I was on the flight here.

02:21.445 --> 02:24.622
There was some mild turbulence,
which never affects me.

02:24.622 --> 02:29.497
But I felt like my chest
was in a vise.

02:29.497 --> 02:30.889
I couldn't breathe.

02:30.889 --> 02:32.717
Scary.

02:35.024 --> 02:37.113
Why did you
become a journalist?

02:37.113 --> 02:39.071
Because I care
about the truth.

02:39.071 --> 02:41.030
Why do you think
you care about the truth?

02:41.030 --> 02:42.945
Because it matters.

02:44.729 --> 02:46.601
Because people lie

02:46.601 --> 02:49.081
to abuse power
and to hurt people.

02:49.081 --> 02:53.303
Was anyone important in your
life ever untruthful to you?

02:58.482 --> 03:00.789
Yeah.

03:00.789 --> 03:03.444
My mother.

03:03.444 --> 03:06.098
And my father.

03:26.858 --> 03:29.687
Sorry.
Dropped my hammer.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.515
You know, I was looking
for something under my desk.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.082
Not ducking. At all.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.779
And I did not
just pee a little.

03:36.868 --> 03:38.174
Anyone hear from Eileen?

03:39.915 --> 03:41.482
Pretty sure I'd be
curled up in bed

03:41.482 --> 03:44.572
with a tub of banana pudding
watching "Project Runway."

03:46.400 --> 03:47.966
What?
It's aspirational.

03:47.966 --> 03:49.751
No judgment.
Just noted.

03:49.751 --> 03:52.275
- Noted's worse.
- Feels that way.

03:52.275 --> 03:55.191
Finn keeps having nightmares.
This morning, he said,

03:55.191 --> 03:57.280
"Mommy, is the bad man
gonna get you next?"

03:58.412 --> 04:00.501
That pisses me off.

04:00.501 --> 04:03.417
I'm angry all the time.

04:03.417 --> 04:04.896
Angry all the time.
That's my motto.

04:04.896 --> 04:06.811
Eileen, you're back!

04:06.811 --> 04:08.726
I am. What'd I miss?

04:08.726 --> 04:12.556
Uh, Austin came out
as a "Project Runway" watcher.

04:13.209 --> 04:14.384
Congrats.

04:14.384 --> 04:15.777
I feel lighter.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.431
Can I give you a hug?

04:17.431 --> 04:20.042
If you make it quick.

04:20.042 --> 04:22.784
- Feel better?
- I do. Welcome back.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.960
Yes, indeed.
Welcome back.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.919
- You coming in for a hug, too?
- I wasn't planning on that, no.

04:27.919 --> 04:29.269
But the newsroom
made this for you.

04:34.404 --> 04:37.320
That's really nice.
Thanks, guys.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.365
Where's Gabriel?

04:38.365 --> 04:40.062
Not back yet.

04:40.062 --> 04:42.499
- Anyone seen him?
- Said he needed space.

04:43.805 --> 04:46.329
Got it. Damn.

04:46.329 --> 04:47.678
Eileen.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.377
You have been missed.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.726
So I've heard.

04:51.726 --> 04:53.423
Join me in my office?

04:53.423 --> 04:55.033
Seriously?

04:55.033 --> 04:56.992
As happy as I am
to see you in person,

04:56.992 --> 04:59.299
should you be back
so soon?

04:59.299 --> 05:01.475
I saw the shrink. That's what
you asked me to do, right?

05:01.475 --> 05:03.346
- Helpful?
- She's smart.

05:03.346 --> 05:04.739
But you know me.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.915
I like to be the one
asking the questions.

05:06.915 --> 05:10.266
Can you promise me
you'll keep seeing Linda?

05:10.266 --> 05:11.267
Is that an order?

05:11.267 --> 05:13.008
A request.

05:13.008 --> 05:15.184
And maybe we take it slow
for a bit?

05:16.664 --> 05:17.447
It's good to be back.

05:17.447 --> 05:18.796
Eileen.

05:20.189 --> 05:21.756
I'm sorry you had
to go through that.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.847
Between us...

05:25.847 --> 05:27.457
so am I.

05:27.457 --> 05:29.894
Enjoy your time alone?

05:29.894 --> 05:31.461
Not gonna lie,
kinda did.

05:31.461 --> 05:33.463
Can't get rid of me
that easily.

05:33.463 --> 05:36.640
Damn. I thought the crazed
gunman bit might do the trick.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.251
That old gag.

05:39.251 --> 05:41.993
Any news on our pastor,
Reed Gallahorn?

05:41.993 --> 05:44.344
His church
is called New Zion.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.955
The Anchorage PD arrested him
six years ago.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.739
Charged him
with a felony assault.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.175
So our person of interest
has a prior record.

05:51.568 --> 05:53.091
Who was the victim?

05:53.091 --> 05:55.311
Wasn't named.
Charges were dropped.

05:55.311 --> 05:58.706
Get this, they didn't
swab Gallahorn for DNA.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.969
Well, our cops are consistent
if nothing else.

06:00.969 --> 06:03.101
Oh, this is a reporter

06:03.101 --> 06:04.407
from the <i>Omaha Record.</i>

06:04.407 --> 06:06.844
- What'd he report on?
- A dead teenager

06:06.844 --> 06:09.369
found behind Gallahorn's
previous church in Nebraska.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.935
Broken neck.

06:10.935 --> 06:12.067
Huh, you buried
the lede there.

06:13.982 --> 06:15.592
Hi, Max.

06:15.592 --> 06:17.159
<i>Hello, Roz.</i>

06:17.159 --> 06:18.552
Thanks for calling.

06:18.552 --> 06:21.555
This is my colleague,
Eileen Fitzgerald.

06:21.555 --> 06:24.035
<i>Oh, Eileen, they just
mentioned you on CNN.</i>

06:24.035 --> 06:25.689
<i>I'm sorry about what happened.</i>

06:25.689 --> 06:27.125
<i>Uh, you hanging in?</i>

06:27.125 --> 06:28.649
I'm all right.
Thanks, Max.

06:28.649 --> 06:30.085
<i>How can I help?</i>

06:30.085 --> 06:31.478
We're investigating
the murder

06:31.478 --> 06:34.394
of an IÃ±upiaq woman
named Gloria Nanmac.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.919
We've been gathering information
on her pastor, Reed Gallahorn.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.355
<i>Oh.</i>

06:39.355 --> 06:41.531
<i>That's a name
I'll never forget.</i>

06:41.531 --> 06:44.142
<i>Randy Martin. Sweet boy.</i>

06:44.142 --> 06:46.188
<i>His mom blamed Gallahorn,</i>

06:46.188 --> 06:49.626
<i>but the medical examiner
ruled it accidental.</i>

06:49.626 --> 06:52.847
<i>He was working on the roof.
The theory was he fell.</i>

06:52.847 --> 06:55.153
- You don't believe that theory.
<i>- I do not.</i>

06:55.153 --> 06:58.156
<i>Gallahorn had motive.
Randy was my source.</i>

06:58.156 --> 07:00.463
That wasn't
in your articles.

07:00.463 --> 07:02.291
<i>No, I promised the parents</i>

07:02.291 --> 07:03.684
<i>I would leave it
out of the record.</i>

07:03.684 --> 07:05.729
<i>I was investigating Gallahorn.</i>

07:05.729 --> 07:08.471
<i>Heard rumors
about extreme practices.</i>

07:08.471 --> 07:10.081
What kind
of extreme practices?

07:10.081 --> 07:12.649
<i>Well, violence.
Physical abuse.</i>

07:12.649 --> 07:15.217
- Sexual abuse?
<i>- No. Never.</i>

07:15.217 --> 07:17.480
<i>I couldn't prove it,
but I'm convinced</i>

07:17.480 --> 07:20.309
<i>that he silenced
a whistleblower.</i>

07:20.309 --> 07:22.267
<i>I think he killed that boy.</i>

07:26.054 --> 07:28.448
Did you get any more from Alice,

07:28.448 --> 07:29.971
Gloria's friend from church?

07:29.971 --> 07:32.060
You know, the one
that was in Bob's notebook.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.584
I reached out,
left a message.

07:34.584 --> 07:36.281
She didn't call me back.

07:36.281 --> 07:38.675
All right,
then we go back to Meade.

07:38.675 --> 07:41.330
Talk to her in person,
then talk to Gallahorn.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.680
Stanley doesn't
want you going up to Meade.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.726
Well,
I told him I'm fine.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.205
I'm not gonna let
some idiot with a gun

07:47.205 --> 07:48.859
interfere with
our investigation.

07:50.121 --> 07:52.167
Anyway, I thought
you hated it up there.

07:52.167 --> 07:55.083
The whole "no trees"
and annoying half-brother thing.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.128
Actually, I've been in touch
with Derek.

07:57.128 --> 07:59.130
It's been kind of nice.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.218
Huh.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.092
Look, Eileen,
I'll do what you want here,

08:04.092 --> 08:06.616
but maybe we can
tag team this thing.

08:06.616 --> 08:09.097
I'll go up to Meade
and look into Gallahorn.

08:09.097 --> 08:12.535
You stay here and report on
the state's broken DNA system.

08:12.535 --> 08:14.319
We publish
and pressure the state

08:14.319 --> 08:17.671
to test both Gallahorn
and Gloria's DNA.

08:17.671 --> 08:19.281
Maybe we get a match.

08:19.281 --> 08:21.588
Divide and conquer.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.896
Anyone heard from Gabriel?

08:25.896 --> 08:28.159
Just a few texts.
Austin?

08:28.159 --> 08:29.770
I texted last night.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.859
He said he just needs
a little more time.

08:31.859 --> 08:32.947
Should we go see him?

08:32.947 --> 08:33.948
Go see who?

08:33.948 --> 08:35.515
Gabriel.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.907
He asked for space.

08:36.907 --> 08:38.387
We should respect that.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.700
Hey. I know
what you told the gang,

08:46.700 --> 08:48.615
but I'm worried
about Gabriel.

08:48.615 --> 08:50.921
He lives alone, and no one's
heard from him all day.

08:50.921 --> 08:53.576
You have to respect
a man's need for privacy.

08:56.013 --> 08:57.493
Close the door.

09:03.238 --> 09:04.848
<i>Hello?</i>

09:04.848 --> 09:07.416
Gabriel!
It's Bob and Claire.

09:07.416 --> 09:08.722
<i>Hi, guys.</i>

09:08.722 --> 09:10.462
We're all thinking
about you

09:10.462 --> 09:12.377
and wanted to see
how you're doing.

09:12.377 --> 09:14.466
If you need anything.

09:14.466 --> 09:17.339
<i>No. I'm fine. Really.</i>

09:17.339 --> 09:18.993
Thank you.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.560
<i>Are you eating?</i>

09:20.560 --> 09:21.604
Yeah. I am.

09:21.604 --> 09:24.128
What are you eating?

09:24.128 --> 09:27.654
<i>I just had some Triscuits,
slice of bologna.</i>

09:27.654 --> 09:29.177
I think I read that nitrates

09:29.177 --> 09:30.395
exacerbate trauma.

09:32.006 --> 09:34.312
Are you getting
outside at all?

09:34.312 --> 09:37.315
No. I like being home.

09:37.315 --> 09:39.666
<i>I'm bingeing
"Lake House of Love."</i>

09:39.666 --> 09:42.146
Okay. Well...

09:42.146 --> 09:44.192
will you let us know
if you need anything?

09:44.192 --> 09:45.976
Yeah, I will.

09:45.976 --> 09:48.283
Thanks, guys.
Bye-bye.

09:48.283 --> 09:51.634
<i>WOMAN [on TV]: He swore he'd be
giving me his candlestick...</i>

09:51.634 --> 09:54.985
So what do we do?

09:54.985 --> 09:57.597
I still think we have to
honor his wishes.

10:00.861 --> 10:03.385
Helen. Eileen Fitzgerald,
<i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

10:03.385 --> 10:04.647
I remember you.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.170
I come in peace.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.650
I'm doing a story

10:07.650 --> 10:09.826
on why Gloria Nanmac's DNA
still hasn't been tested.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.132
Any ideas?

10:11.132 --> 10:13.090
All media goes through
public affairs now.

10:13.090 --> 10:15.136
I can't help with
any questions you have.

10:15.136 --> 10:18.487
Well, let me ask you something,
off the record.

10:18.487 --> 10:21.882
How does the state decide when
to test a deceased person's DNA?

10:21.882 --> 10:25.102
Off the record,
the state only tests DNA

10:25.102 --> 10:27.496
when a death is ruled
possible homicide.

10:27.496 --> 10:29.498
If the cause is undetermined,
the state won't test.

10:29.498 --> 10:30.891
Too expensive.

10:30.891 --> 10:32.327
But what if
new evidence indicates

10:32.327 --> 10:34.024
that it was a homicide?

10:34.024 --> 10:35.896
Might that prompt
the state to test?

10:35.896 --> 10:37.985
Maybe. Yeah.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.639
Why maybe?
What has to happen?

10:41.728 --> 10:44.295
Come on, Helen. You know
I've had a pretty crappy week.

10:45.949 --> 10:48.256
The public safety commissioner's
office would need to change

10:48.256 --> 10:51.085
the status of a case
from undetermined to homicide.

10:51.085 --> 10:52.303
Only they can do it.

10:52.303 --> 10:54.001
Well, lucky me.
It turns out

10:54.001 --> 10:56.699
the public safety commissioner
happens to be a friend.

11:04.925 --> 11:05.795
Hi, Roz.

11:07.754 --> 11:10.104
Hey, Derek.

11:10.104 --> 11:12.541
Thanks for picking me up
on such short notice.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.369
I was happy you called.

11:14.369 --> 11:15.979
It's great to see you.

11:35.129 --> 11:36.217
How's Eileen?

11:38.219 --> 11:40.917
Yeah, she's okay.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.963
She's reporting a story
in Anchorage.

11:44.878 --> 11:47.054
By the way, Dad totally
freaked out when he heard

11:47.054 --> 11:49.317
a guy broke into the office
with a gun.

11:49.317 --> 11:50.492
He thought
you were in there.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.712
He was super upset.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.802
- Hmm.
- In other news,

11:55.802 --> 11:57.151
Chief Durkin
tried to get me fired

11:57.151 --> 11:59.283
for giving Eileen
those police files.

12:00.284 --> 12:02.243
Didn't work.

12:02.243 --> 12:03.418
What a jerk.

12:12.949 --> 12:16.387
I don't know where you got that,
but it's not true.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.215
Gloria's friend Alice
told me

12:18.215 --> 12:20.827
that she went
to Gallahorn's church with her.

12:20.827 --> 12:24.047
That's why I'm here.
To interview her and Gallahorn.

12:24.047 --> 12:26.223
Alice was involved
with Gallahorn's church.

12:26.223 --> 12:27.355
She still is.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.400
But Gloria wasn't.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.838
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.623
I raised Gloria Presbyterian.

12:34.623 --> 12:36.668
We have an IÃ±upiaq pastor.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.801
It's a wonderful community.

12:38.801 --> 12:42.239
But... Gloria started
pulling away.

12:42.239 --> 12:43.850
From the church?

12:43.850 --> 12:46.591
From the church.
From me.

12:46.591 --> 12:48.202
She was doing
what young people do.

12:48.202 --> 12:49.856
How do you know she didn't
fall in with Gallahorn?

12:51.248 --> 12:53.294
Gloria and Alice
were close.

12:53.294 --> 12:56.427
And when I heard from Alice's
mother that Alice started going,

12:56.427 --> 12:57.820
I asked Gloria.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.126
She said no.

13:00.388 --> 13:02.172
She told me herself.

13:02.172 --> 13:04.305
I know my daughter.

13:04.305 --> 13:07.177
I taught her to watch out
for men like Gallahorn.

13:08.222 --> 13:10.093
She just knew better.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.967
She just did.

13:13.967 --> 13:16.578
Commissioner Haynes.
Got a minute?

13:16.578 --> 13:19.320
Eileen. I'm surprised to see you
back on the job so soon.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.843
Gotta make a living.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.845
I'm sorry that happened.
It's shameful.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.760
Agreed. And thanks.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.806
So, listen, I want to talk
to you about Gloria Nanmac,

13:26.806 --> 13:29.504
an IÃ±upiaq woman who was
murdered two years ago in Meade.

13:29.504 --> 13:31.158
I'm not familiar
with the case.

13:31.158 --> 13:34.204
Well, the upshot is
her DNA test was never run.

13:34.204 --> 13:38.078
The medical examiner listed her
cause of death as undetermined,

13:38.078 --> 13:40.167
and only homicide cases
are tested.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.386
- That's correct.
- Well, it's my understanding

13:42.386 --> 13:45.346
that you have sole discretion
to reclassify her case.

13:45.346 --> 13:46.913
Well,
it's not that simple.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.089
Well, a young woman
was beaten to death.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.481
What am I missing?

13:50.481 --> 13:52.527
We focus on
cases we can solve.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.572
We only have
so many resources.

13:54.572 --> 13:57.488
This is two years old.
Is there even a suspect?

13:57.488 --> 14:00.100
Not officially,
but we think we have one.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.363
The pastor of Gloria's church
in Meade.

14:02.363 --> 14:05.453
He was a person of interest
in the original investigation.

14:05.453 --> 14:08.499
He was also arrested for assault
six years ago in Anchorage.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.675
And we discovered a teenager
from his first church

14:10.675 --> 14:12.721
in the lower 48,
he was also found dead.

14:12.721 --> 14:13.983
Have you
reported on this?

14:13.983 --> 14:15.593
Not yet.

14:15.593 --> 14:17.160
But I am planning
on writing a story

14:17.160 --> 14:20.468
on why the state isn't
testing arrestees or victims.

14:20.468 --> 14:22.252
Test Gallahorn
and Gloria now.

14:22.252 --> 14:23.863
You'll have a chance
to get ahead of it.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.474
I'm not gonna be
pressured by you.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.780
I'm just asking you
to do the right thing.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.434
And as you know by now,
I'll keep asking

14:30.434 --> 14:32.175
for as long as it takes.

14:32.175 --> 14:34.221
Well, we both know
you don't have that long.

14:36.310 --> 14:37.572
What does that mean?

14:37.572 --> 14:40.967
Seriously?
You're gonna play dumb.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.491
Conrad Pritchard is selling
<i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

14:47.451 --> 14:50.063
Come on, Stanley.
You're not being reasonable.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.934
We're barely covering
the news, Aaron.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.328
We can't afford
to be short more reporters.

14:55.285 --> 14:57.287
What about furloughs?

14:57.287 --> 14:59.986
We'll make cuts,
but we'll spread it out.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.814
That will kill what's left
of the morale in the newsroom.

15:02.814 --> 15:04.207
At least we'll have
a newsroom.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.384
Listen.

15:07.384 --> 15:09.952
We have to make cuts
to the budget.

15:14.652 --> 15:16.959
Hello, Eileen.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.308
<i>Hey, is the paper being sold?</i>

15:18.308 --> 15:20.571
What?
Where'd you hear that?

15:20.571 --> 15:22.182
Commissioner Haynes.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.271
<i>I'm with Aaron right now.
I'll call you back.</i>

15:24.271 --> 15:26.186
No. Ask him about it. Now.

15:26.186 --> 15:27.665
I'll call you back.

15:27.665 --> 15:28.971
No.
Ask him or I will.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.757
Stanley?

15:32.757 --> 15:35.891
Hello?

15:37.153 --> 15:38.372
Something up?

15:38.372 --> 15:39.851
With her? Always.

15:42.376 --> 15:44.247
Speak of the devil.

15:44.247 --> 15:45.988
Don't answer it.
She's fishing.

15:47.859 --> 15:49.209
Hey, Eileen.
What's up?

15:49.209 --> 15:50.645
Hey, I just heard
from Commissioner Haynes

15:50.645 --> 15:52.516
your father is
selling the paper.

15:52.516 --> 15:54.388
What?
Where'd she hear that?

15:54.388 --> 15:56.781
She didn't say.
Is it true?

15:56.781 --> 15:58.000
<i>No, it's not true.</i>

15:58.000 --> 15:59.654
Are you sure?

15:59.654 --> 16:02.135
If he was, I would know.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.658
Cutting the budget

16:03.658 --> 16:05.094
improves the bottom line

16:05.094 --> 16:07.444
and makes <i>The Alaskan</i>
more valuable to a buyer.

16:07.444 --> 16:08.489
<i>Hello?</i>

16:08.489 --> 16:10.273
Hello?

16:10.273 --> 16:12.275
<i>We're processing.</i>

16:12.275 --> 16:13.755
Well, maybe we should talk
to your old man.

16:13.755 --> 16:15.148
- No.
- No.

16:15.148 --> 16:16.453
Eileen,
we'll call you back.

16:16.453 --> 16:17.889
Do not hang up on me ag--

16:21.502 --> 16:23.678
You know your father.

16:23.678 --> 16:25.114
You think this is real?

16:27.073 --> 16:28.552
He's been angry

16:28.552 --> 16:31.381
since Austin's story
tanked Moses' campaign.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.864
Really didn't appreciate
being ambushed by Eileen

16:35.864 --> 16:36.952
at the Arts Gala.

16:36.952 --> 16:38.475
You need
to talk to him now.

16:40.782 --> 16:43.393
I won't go to him
with a rumor.

16:43.393 --> 16:46.092
I need to know the answer to
this question before I ask it.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.984
Alice Porter?

17:08.984 --> 17:10.899
May I help you?

17:10.899 --> 17:12.727
I'm Roz Friendly, a reporter
with <i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

17:12.727 --> 17:13.989
We spoke?

17:15.469 --> 17:17.558
- What are you doing here?
- I flew up from Anchorage.

17:17.558 --> 17:20.039
I want to talk to you
about your friend Gloria.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.519
I'm trying to understand
her involvement with the church.

17:22.519 --> 17:24.782
I'm sorry.

17:24.782 --> 17:26.132
I can't talk to you.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.047
Why?

17:30.788 --> 17:31.702
Pastor Gallahorn?

17:32.790 --> 17:34.183
Yes.

17:34.183 --> 17:36.011
I'm Roz Friendly
with <i>The Daily Alaskan.</i>

17:36.011 --> 17:39.101
I'm reporting a story
on the death of Gloria Nanmac.

17:42.365 --> 17:45.064
Alice, can you take this
into the kitchen?

17:50.678 --> 17:53.811
Alice and Gloria
were very close.

17:53.811 --> 17:57.554
Talking about her is difficult.
For all of us.

17:57.554 --> 18:00.035
When's the last time
you spoke to Gloria?

18:00.035 --> 18:01.863
The night
she disappeared.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.431
What about?

18:04.431 --> 18:06.868
She had a fight
with her mother.

18:06.868 --> 18:08.130
She was upset.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.523
Struggling.

18:09.523 --> 18:11.786
Hmm.
Struggling how?

18:13.353 --> 18:14.745
She was planning on
running away from home.

18:14.745 --> 18:17.008
I tried to help her.

18:17.008 --> 18:19.141
I offered her the spiritual
tools to protect herself.

18:20.490 --> 18:23.319
But she couldn't
escape the darkness.

18:23.319 --> 18:26.670
Is that what happened
to Randy Martin in Nebraska?

18:32.633 --> 18:35.462
Are you a Christian woman,
Ms. Friendly?

18:35.462 --> 18:37.290
I'm not here
to talk about me.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.292
- Are you sure about that?
- Very.

18:39.292 --> 18:40.728
Did you kill Randy

18:40.728 --> 18:42.425
because he was going
to talk to a reporter?

18:44.253 --> 18:47.126
I'd like you
to leave now.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.171
I have nothing else
to say.

18:51.173 --> 18:54.350
Hey, check this.
It's a text from Gabriel.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.918
Five thumbs up?
He's overcompensating.

18:56.918 --> 18:58.311
Definitely.

18:58.311 --> 18:59.138
We should check in, right?

19:00.748 --> 19:02.315
We all agreed not to.

19:02.315 --> 19:04.621
Okay, but that was before
we got this emoji cry for help.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.537
You're right.
Let me file this story,

19:07.537 --> 19:08.843
and we make a plan.

19:08.843 --> 19:10.192
Okay, done.

19:10.192 --> 19:12.151
Wait, Gallahorn said
he spoke to Gloria

19:12.151 --> 19:13.978
the night
she went missing?

19:13.978 --> 19:16.198
<i>He offered it up
like it was nothing.</i>

19:16.198 --> 19:18.200
Well, did Alice
corroborate it?

19:18.200 --> 19:21.160
She won't talk to me.
At least not yet.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.900
Any luck down there?

19:22.900 --> 19:24.598
The state will only
test Gloria's DNA

19:24.598 --> 19:26.208
if the public safety commissioner

19:26.208 --> 19:28.123
reclassifies her case
as a homicide.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.735
<i>And Haynes won't.
But I've been pressing.</i>

19:31.735 --> 19:33.781
Talk to JCAN.
They can help.

19:33.781 --> 19:35.217
JCAN?

19:35.217 --> 19:36.958
Justice Council
for Alaska Natives.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.568
A non-profit
that helps Natives

19:38.568 --> 19:40.527
navigate the criminal
justice system.

19:40.527 --> 19:41.745
Who do I call?

19:41.745 --> 19:43.617
Alberta Hartman,
the executive director.

19:43.617 --> 19:45.488
I'll let her know
you're coming.

19:47.838 --> 19:50.667
I come to visit her
almost every day.

19:53.757 --> 19:55.368
Sylvie...

19:57.152 --> 19:59.720
...I'm sorry to ask.

19:59.720 --> 20:02.157
But Gallahorn said you got
in a fight with Gloria

20:02.157 --> 20:03.419
the night
she went missing.

20:03.419 --> 20:05.595
Is that accurate?

20:07.945 --> 20:10.644
Yes, it is.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.646
What was
the fight about?

20:14.822 --> 20:16.693
I didn't want her
to go out.

20:16.693 --> 20:19.783
The last time
she went to a party,

20:19.783 --> 20:23.178
she ended up getting frostbite
on her walk home.

20:24.571 --> 20:26.834
Is it possible that
she was going to run away?

20:30.838 --> 20:33.797
She was young
and emotional.

20:35.364 --> 20:37.975
Didn't we all want to run away
at some point?

20:44.373 --> 20:46.462
Thanks for sitting down
with me so last minute.

20:46.462 --> 20:49.073
Anything for Roz.
Apologies for the mess.

20:49.073 --> 20:50.988
One day we'll have the budget
to digitize.

20:50.988 --> 20:53.817
No worries at all.
Uh, so, our reporting shows

20:53.817 --> 20:55.993
the state isn't testing
arrestees or victims.

20:55.993 --> 20:58.039
And when I spoke
to Commissioner Haynes,

20:58.039 --> 20:59.083
she pled poverty.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.477
Please.

21:01.477 --> 21:05.307
Almost a year ago, the JCAN
lobbied for a $2 million grant

21:05.307 --> 21:08.528
so the state could run DNA tests
on suspects and victims.

21:08.528 --> 21:11.226
Haynes assured us the money
would be earmarked for testing.

21:11.226 --> 21:12.836
Did you audit
their use of the funds?

21:12.836 --> 21:15.099
We requested an audit
three times.

21:15.099 --> 21:17.624
State says the budget's
still "in process."

21:17.624 --> 21:19.626
You think they're
covering up?

21:20.931 --> 21:22.977
The $2 million question.

21:25.327 --> 21:26.807
<i>Everything all right?</i>

21:26.807 --> 21:29.113
Well, I'm not being held
hostage, so there's that.

21:29.113 --> 21:30.680
<i>Glass half full.
Like it.</i>

21:30.680 --> 21:32.073
Who in the statehouse
might have a copy

21:32.073 --> 21:33.727
of the state's
draft budget?

21:33.727 --> 21:36.120
Uh, some staffers,
lobbyists with sway.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.252
You wanna get your hands
on it?

21:37.252 --> 21:38.514
I do.

21:38.514 --> 21:40.037
I have a guy.
On Senator Farrell's staff.

21:40.037 --> 21:41.691
Let me take a run at him.

21:41.691 --> 21:43.998
I owe you, Austin.
Thank you.

21:46.261 --> 21:47.697
Great.
Uh, can you close the door?

21:50.396 --> 21:52.136
Are you firing me?

21:52.136 --> 21:54.356
No such luck.

21:54.356 --> 21:57.881
You're close with Brenda
in accounting, right?

21:57.881 --> 22:00.971
Fairly. Uh, Aiden does
rock climbing with her kid.

22:00.971 --> 22:02.408
Why?

22:02.408 --> 22:06.586
I need to know
if Conrad Pritchard's office

22:06.586 --> 22:09.371
requested the paper's
financials recently

22:09.371 --> 22:12.243
and, if so,
where they sent them.

22:12.243 --> 22:15.464
You want me to report
on our owners?

22:15.464 --> 22:17.466
This needs to be discreet.

22:17.466 --> 22:20.077
If I go into accounting,
it'll raise red flags.

22:20.077 --> 22:21.122
Understood?

22:23.603 --> 22:25.169
Understood.

22:30.958 --> 22:33.961
You're becoming
my go-to spreadsheet expert.

22:33.961 --> 22:35.963
Happy to use
my misspent education.

22:35.963 --> 22:37.704
Any way we can lure you over
to the paper?

22:38.966 --> 22:40.097
Would I have to
take a pay cut?

22:40.097 --> 22:41.403
Probably.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.710
Definitely.

22:43.710 --> 22:45.668
Let's just stick
to the piecework.

22:45.668 --> 22:48.671
Okay. Look at this.

22:48.671 --> 22:50.456
This is the department
of public safety's budget

22:50.456 --> 22:51.718
for the last fiscal year.

22:51.718 --> 22:54.329
- It's flat.
- What does that mean?

22:54.329 --> 22:56.592
Well, this column
shows the $2 million

22:56.592 --> 22:58.551
that the JCAN lobbied for
going in.

22:58.551 --> 23:02.293
But this column
for "facility maintenance"...

23:02.293 --> 23:05.296
Is $2 million more
than the previous year.

23:05.296 --> 23:08.082
Right. So the state took
the grant money

23:08.082 --> 23:10.214
and spent it
on something else.

23:10.214 --> 23:12.521
So none of the money
was used for DNA testing.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.958
Not based on this.

23:14.958 --> 23:17.091
These books are cooked.
It's no question.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.445
Excuse me.
You need an appointment.

23:23.445 --> 23:25.404
I'll be in and out. Promise.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.623
What the hell, Eileen?

23:29.146 --> 23:30.713
We need to talk.

23:30.713 --> 23:33.324
I heard you the first time.
These things take time.

23:33.324 --> 23:35.544
If you need to write your story,
by all means, go ahead.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.024
The story's changed.

23:37.024 --> 23:39.461
It's no longer about budgets
and red tape.

23:39.461 --> 23:40.723
It's about corruption.

23:40.723 --> 23:43.073
- Corruption?
- I'm writing a story

23:43.073 --> 23:46.163
about how your department
misappropriated funds from JCAN

23:46.163 --> 23:48.165
that should have been used
for DNA testing.

23:48.165 --> 23:49.253
According to who?

23:49.253 --> 23:50.559
Your own budget.

23:53.867 --> 23:56.173
- Care to comment?
- Budget's not out yet.

23:56.173 --> 23:57.914
I don't know how you got
this draft, but--

23:57.914 --> 23:59.481
You want to let me know
what you did with the $2 million

23:59.481 --> 24:01.440
that was earmarked
for DNA testing?

24:01.440 --> 24:03.572
Eileen, we're done here.

24:05.095 --> 24:07.881
Does it matter to you

24:07.881 --> 24:10.579
that Gloria's killer
might get away?

24:10.579 --> 24:12.625
Get out of my office.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.106
The people you serve

24:16.106 --> 24:18.935
should know what you're doing
with their money.

24:18.935 --> 24:21.285
And I'm gonna see to it
that they do.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.490
Chris Gallahorn.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.971
Where did you go,
Chris Gallahorn?

25:00.499 --> 25:02.283
- What's up?
<i>- Gallahorn has posted</i>

25:02.283 --> 25:05.982
family photos on his site
going back 15 years.

25:05.982 --> 25:09.508
Six years ago, the son
disappeared from the photos.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.814
Well, six years ago, Gallahorn
had an assault charge

25:11.814 --> 25:14.164
which was dropped.

25:14.164 --> 25:15.470
Could be the son
who filed the charge.

25:15.470 --> 25:16.558
We should talk to him.

25:19.343 --> 25:21.955
He's in Anchorage.
I'll send you the address.

25:38.754 --> 25:40.451
Nirvana?

25:40.451 --> 25:42.497
Not even close.

25:42.497 --> 25:44.194
Brenda said
that Conrad's office

25:44.194 --> 25:47.067
requested annual reports
going back five years.

25:47.067 --> 25:49.112
She sent them to Horizon Capital
in New York.

25:49.112 --> 25:50.679
Horizon?

25:50.679 --> 25:52.986
I already looked it up.
Not good.

25:52.986 --> 25:54.988
Horizon's been buying up
local newspapers

25:54.988 --> 25:56.990
all across the country
and gutting them.

25:56.990 --> 25:58.557
We've been down
this road, Stanley.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.646
Twice,
if memory serves.

26:00.646 --> 26:02.952
We won't survive
another buyout.

26:02.952 --> 26:05.651
Don't disagree.

26:08.088 --> 26:09.698
- Stanley?
<i>- It's real, Aaron.</i>

26:09.698 --> 26:12.135
And it's worse
than we thought.

26:12.135 --> 26:14.094
Okay.

26:14.094 --> 26:15.922
<i>I can fill you in
on the details,</i>

26:15.922 --> 26:18.272
but, Aaron,
if it comes to a head

26:18.272 --> 26:20.143
and the future of our paper
is on the line,

26:20.143 --> 26:22.232
I might have some information
that could be helpful.

26:22.232 --> 26:24.495
What kind of information?

26:24.495 --> 26:26.497
<i>Incomplete information.</i>

26:26.497 --> 26:30.763
A couple of deals your father's
quietly closed recently.

26:30.763 --> 26:33.330
It could be enough to barter
with if it comes to that.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.899
I'm listening.

26:39.859 --> 26:42.165
Anything you ask
has to be off the record.

26:42.165 --> 26:44.428
Chris, we need someone
on the record.

26:44.428 --> 26:46.474
No way.

26:46.474 --> 26:48.345
Look.

26:48.345 --> 26:50.304
We settled when I dropped
the charges against my dad,

26:50.304 --> 26:51.871
and I signed an NDA.

26:51.871 --> 26:54.134
If he finds out I broke it,
he'll sue me.

26:54.134 --> 26:56.571
I got a wife and kid.
I can't risk it.

26:56.571 --> 26:59.792
Okay. How about background?
No attribution.

26:59.792 --> 27:02.490
I'll pin it on a former member
of his church.

27:06.407 --> 27:08.670
What happened?

27:08.670 --> 27:10.672
He broke my jaw.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.369
Why?

27:12.369 --> 27:14.545
Told him
I was an atheist.

27:16.765 --> 27:19.289
In our reporting,
we heard stories

27:19.289 --> 27:20.987
of violence perpetrated
against parishioners.

27:20.987 --> 27:22.118
Is that true?

27:22.118 --> 27:24.425
Yes. Of course.

27:24.425 --> 27:26.035
Why of course?

27:26.035 --> 27:28.124
My father's a sadist.

27:28.124 --> 27:30.649
A sadist?

27:30.649 --> 27:32.433
He says he believes
you can only know God

27:32.433 --> 27:34.609
if you feel the pain
that Christ felt.

27:34.609 --> 27:36.611
But the truth is,
he gets off on it.

27:36.611 --> 27:38.613
What does he do
specifically?

27:38.613 --> 27:41.747
Starts with fasting.
Exposure to the elements.

27:41.747 --> 27:44.575
Then whips. Paddles.

27:44.575 --> 27:47.796
Least he's not a hypocrite.
Harms himself, too.

27:47.796 --> 27:49.406
Did you witness
him hurting anyone?

27:49.406 --> 27:51.234
Witness it?

27:51.234 --> 27:53.323
I lived it.

28:08.599 --> 28:09.862
Yeah.

28:09.862 --> 28:11.211
This is strong.

28:11.211 --> 28:12.908
I just moved around
a few graphs,

28:12.908 --> 28:13.953
tightened the lede.

28:13.953 --> 28:15.606
Good.
We're good to publish?

28:15.606 --> 28:17.086
As soon as copy reads.

28:17.086 --> 28:19.306
- How's Roz making out?
- No breaks.

28:19.306 --> 28:21.090
But I tracked down
Gallahorn's son.

28:21.090 --> 28:24.746
He's got scars all over his back
from being whipped.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.095
Will he go on the record?

28:26.095 --> 28:28.054
Background. But he's all
the confirmation we need.

28:28.054 --> 28:29.708
I'm gonna call Aaron.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.535
Publisher should write
an editorial

28:31.535 --> 28:34.364
about Gallahorn
not being swabbed.

28:34.364 --> 28:35.888
Might turn the heat up
on the state.

28:37.367 --> 28:38.717
Any word on the sale?

28:38.717 --> 28:42.459
Just focus
on the reporting.

28:42.459 --> 28:45.506
Stanley, I didn't come this far
to not have a job.

28:45.506 --> 28:48.161
Good. Because you don't
not have one.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.959
Alice.

29:03.959 --> 29:06.266
Is it true what you said
about that boy

29:06.266 --> 29:08.007
at Pastor's
Nebraska church?

29:08.007 --> 29:09.835
Yes.

29:09.835 --> 29:12.315
Alice.

29:12.315 --> 29:14.230
Did Gloria go
to that church with you?

29:15.928 --> 29:18.800
I don't know
what happened to Gloria.

29:18.800 --> 29:21.498
I really don't.

29:21.498 --> 29:24.980
I know you loved her.

29:24.980 --> 29:28.244
What happened to her
is not your fault.

29:28.244 --> 29:31.682
But anything you can tell us
will help.

29:35.295 --> 29:37.123
Gloria was trying to get away
from the church.

29:38.646 --> 29:41.170
Pastor Gallahorn wanted
to put the marks on her.

29:41.170 --> 29:43.042
What marks?

29:47.655 --> 29:49.439
Gloria refused.

29:49.439 --> 29:51.659
So Pastor Gallahorn

29:51.659 --> 29:55.271
made her stand in the snow
barefoot as punishment.

29:56.838 --> 29:58.971
That's how
she got frostbite.

30:00.842 --> 30:02.322
Gloria told Pastor Gallahorn

30:02.322 --> 30:04.846
she was gonna expose him
on Facebook.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.500
Did she tell you that?

30:08.632 --> 30:10.069
Yeah.

30:11.679 --> 30:13.246
I have DMs from her.

30:15.291 --> 30:16.640
Can you share those
with me?

30:18.642 --> 30:20.296
Yeah.

30:22.995 --> 30:26.215
This is the pain of true faith.

30:26.215 --> 30:28.391
This is the pain
of true faith.

30:28.391 --> 30:31.830
This is the pain of true faith.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.788
What is it with you and pain,
Pastor?

30:39.794 --> 30:43.189
You do not know God's love
until you know God's pain.

30:43.189 --> 30:45.887
I'll quote you on that.

30:45.887 --> 30:49.325
I'm writing an article on how
you abuse your church members.

30:49.325 --> 30:51.414
I have nothing more
to say to you.

30:51.414 --> 30:52.894
I'm also reporting

30:52.894 --> 30:55.244
on how you had motive
to silence Gloria.

30:55.244 --> 30:57.072
She was going
to expose you.

30:57.072 --> 30:58.639
Just like Randy Martin.

31:00.206 --> 31:01.947
Did you kill
Gloria Nanmac?

31:01.947 --> 31:03.383
Get out.

31:03.383 --> 31:05.820
Did you kill
Gloria Nanmac?

31:05.820 --> 31:08.562
I won't dignify your question
with a response.

31:08.562 --> 31:09.911
Answer her.

31:14.133 --> 31:16.613
Did you kill my daughter?

31:18.528 --> 31:20.791
I tried to save
your daughter.

31:20.791 --> 31:23.229
Is that what you call it?

31:23.229 --> 31:25.927
Making her stand
out in the snow

31:25.927 --> 31:27.798
until she got frostbite?

31:29.322 --> 31:32.586
What did you do
to my daughter?

31:32.586 --> 31:33.804
Nothing.

31:35.458 --> 31:38.505
I was with my wife.
She can vouch for me.

31:38.505 --> 31:41.160
Would you submit
to a DNA test to prove it?

31:41.160 --> 31:43.640
Gladly.

31:48.123 --> 31:49.995
Hi, Claire.

31:49.995 --> 31:52.214
Hi. I know you said
you needed space,

31:52.214 --> 31:54.216
but I thought
one visit wouldn't hurt.

31:54.216 --> 31:55.696
I have food.

31:55.696 --> 31:57.176
Oh, I didn't know
if you had olive oil,

31:57.176 --> 31:59.352
but it was
half price, so...

31:59.352 --> 32:02.007
Oh. Cute place.

32:02.007 --> 32:03.704
Yeah. It's not much.

32:03.704 --> 32:05.967
Please. My first place
had a hot plate in the john.

32:05.967 --> 32:07.708
I do not miss my 20s.

32:10.798 --> 32:12.321
Yeah?

32:17.544 --> 32:20.155
Gabriel. I have two rules
for my reporters.

32:20.155 --> 32:22.592
They file their articles
on time.

32:22.592 --> 32:23.724
And they never go hungry.

32:23.724 --> 32:25.987
Please.

32:25.987 --> 32:28.816
- Hi, Bob.
- Claire Muncy.

32:28.816 --> 32:29.991
You scooped me.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.601
I did.
What did you bring?

32:31.601 --> 32:33.473
I'm making
my renowned marinara.

32:33.473 --> 32:35.214
Oh, great.
I brought a chicken

32:35.214 --> 32:37.085
and the makings
of a very healthy salad.

32:37.085 --> 32:39.218
Guys,
this isn't necessary.

32:39.218 --> 32:40.523
I'll start the water.

32:40.523 --> 32:43.831
Now. Gabriel.
Do you have a garlic press?

32:43.831 --> 32:45.528
What's that?

32:45.528 --> 32:47.835
The DMs from Gloria
are authentic?

32:47.835 --> 32:49.663
Yeah. I watched Alice
log into her account.

32:51.230 --> 32:53.667
Gotta take this.

32:53.667 --> 32:56.148
Commissioner Haynes.

32:56.148 --> 32:58.019
<i>I reclassified
Gloria Nanmac's case</i>

32:58.019 --> 33:00.021
<i>as a homicide.</i>

33:00.021 --> 33:01.544
That's great news.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.546
So are you having
her sample tested?

33:03.546 --> 33:07.420
<i>We are.
And I put a rush on it.</i>

33:07.420 --> 33:09.900
- Thank you.
<i>- Don't thank me.</i>

33:09.900 --> 33:12.077
<i>We're not girlfriends.
No more phone chats.</i>

33:12.077 --> 33:13.904
<i>If DNA leads to an arrest,</i>

33:13.904 --> 33:15.515
<i>you'll find out
when the charges are filed</i>

33:15.515 --> 33:16.690
<i>like everyone else.</i>

33:17.952 --> 33:19.954
You get a response
from Gallahorn?

33:19.954 --> 33:23.088
I did. He denied everything.
He said his wife can alibi him.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.959
But he submitted
to a DNA test?

33:24.959 --> 33:26.569
Meade police say he did.

33:26.569 --> 33:28.093
The lab in Anchorage
has a sample.

33:28.093 --> 33:29.572
Should be a couple of days.

33:29.572 --> 33:31.096
We're trying to get
a rush on it, though.

33:31.096 --> 33:33.098
Timing might be on our side.

33:33.098 --> 33:35.404
They're testing Gloria's DNA.

33:35.404 --> 33:38.842
And I got a new source at
the Medical Examiner's office.

33:38.842 --> 33:40.931
They'll let us know as soon
as Gallahorn's results are in.

33:40.931 --> 33:42.150
Who's your source?

33:42.150 --> 33:44.370
Helen.
We patched things up.

33:44.370 --> 33:45.501
Nice.

33:45.501 --> 33:47.677
You think
this is our guy?

33:47.677 --> 33:49.810
Yeah. I do.

33:49.810 --> 33:53.988
Either way, his pattern of abuse
needs to be exposed.

33:53.988 --> 33:56.251
We give the DNA results
a few days.

33:56.251 --> 33:58.210
If we don't get them,
we publish.

33:58.210 --> 33:59.950
- Makes sense.
- Agreed.

33:59.950 --> 34:02.388
This is good work. Again.

34:05.304 --> 34:07.654
Is it true?

34:07.654 --> 34:09.351
Is what true?

34:09.351 --> 34:10.787
You selling the paper
to Horizon?

34:13.138 --> 34:15.053
- I am.
- Horizon will gut the paper.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.011
They'll destroy it.

34:17.011 --> 34:19.535
I am aware of that.

34:19.535 --> 34:21.233
Dad, look at me.

34:24.192 --> 34:26.542
Why are you doing this?

34:26.542 --> 34:28.457
Money.
Why do we do any of this?

34:28.457 --> 34:30.242
That's the game,
isn't it?

34:30.242 --> 34:33.288
This is about the paper's
coverage of Frank Moses.

34:33.288 --> 34:35.551
And Eileen's questions
at the Gala.

34:35.551 --> 34:37.684
Rude, that one.

34:37.684 --> 34:40.339
Attractive but rude.

34:40.339 --> 34:41.688
No, <i>The Daily Alaskan</i>

34:41.688 --> 34:44.082
has become a burr
under my saddle

34:44.082 --> 34:45.648
with no upside.

34:45.648 --> 34:49.913
You do this,
you go down in Alaskan history

34:49.913 --> 34:52.829
as the guy who killed
the biggest paper in the state.

34:52.829 --> 34:56.094
And that's why
God made PR firms.

34:57.486 --> 35:02.012
If you have to
sell the paper,

35:02.012 --> 35:03.666
sell it to me.

35:03.666 --> 35:05.015
I can't do that.

35:05.015 --> 35:06.321
<i>The Daily Alaskan's</i>
come after our interests

35:06.321 --> 35:07.844
one too many times.

35:07.844 --> 35:09.237
It's bad business.

35:14.242 --> 35:17.941
Well... since we're talking
about business,

35:17.941 --> 35:21.728
maybe we should discuss
your recent land purchases.

35:23.251 --> 35:24.992
Frankly, I was impressed

35:24.992 --> 35:28.300
that you were able to keep the
deals under wraps for so long.

35:31.172 --> 35:33.522
I would tread
very carefully, son.

35:33.522 --> 35:37.483
I'd suggest the same thing
for you, Dad.

35:38.875 --> 35:41.443
I mean,
those environmental groups

35:41.443 --> 35:45.099
catch wind of your secret road,
that would be...

35:45.099 --> 35:46.927
very bad for business.

35:46.927 --> 35:49.016
And how would
they find out?

35:49.016 --> 35:51.497
Might read about it.

35:51.497 --> 35:54.282
Are you threatening me?

35:54.282 --> 35:56.154
Sell me the paper.

35:57.851 --> 35:58.895
You're bluffing.

35:59.983 --> 36:01.724
Am I?

36:08.949 --> 36:10.951
All right.

36:10.951 --> 36:13.649
I'll sell you the paper.

36:13.649 --> 36:16.870
But you will pay me exactly
what Horizon was going to pay me

36:16.870 --> 36:18.567
and not a penny less.

36:18.567 --> 36:21.614
And my business
remains my business.

36:23.398 --> 36:24.791
Understood.

36:24.791 --> 36:27.794
And to put a finer point on it,
going forward,

36:27.794 --> 36:29.926
you are out
of the family business.

36:29.926 --> 36:31.319
Completely.

36:33.060 --> 36:35.671
Keep that paper afloat
with what you have.

36:41.851 --> 36:42.765
Deal.

36:48.293 --> 36:49.685
You wanna grab a drink?

36:51.121 --> 36:52.471
Me?

36:52.471 --> 36:54.603
Yeah, you.

36:54.603 --> 36:56.257
Did you miss me
or something?

36:56.257 --> 36:58.955
Big leap from having a drink
to missing you.

36:58.955 --> 37:00.827
Hey, I missed you.

37:02.132 --> 37:03.960
So yes, to a drink?

37:03.960 --> 37:06.485
I would. But I'm gonna
head to the hospital,

37:06.485 --> 37:07.703
check in on Sylvie.

37:07.703 --> 37:08.704
You heard anything?

37:10.184 --> 37:12.578
Not yet.
She's nervous.

37:12.578 --> 37:14.754
She was meeting
with the doctor today.

37:14.754 --> 37:16.364
Mind if I join?

37:16.364 --> 37:17.713
Not at all.

37:22.718 --> 37:24.372
Smells great, Bob.

37:24.372 --> 37:25.852
Mmm, just you wait.

37:27.375 --> 37:29.290
I'll get it.

37:37.516 --> 37:40.519
Hey. I know we're supposed
to be giving you space, but--

37:40.519 --> 37:42.782
Whaaaat?

37:42.782 --> 37:44.784
Something smells good.

37:44.784 --> 37:46.786
Bob's making spaghetti.

37:46.786 --> 37:48.309
Hey, I thought we were supposed
to be leaving Gabe alone.

37:48.309 --> 37:50.398
Yeah, well, tell a reporter
not to do something

37:50.398 --> 37:51.573
and suddenly it's a party.

37:51.573 --> 37:53.488
Oh, good.
We brought wine.

37:53.488 --> 37:54.707
And a movie.

37:54.707 --> 37:57.057
Oh, I don't have
a DVD player.

37:57.057 --> 37:58.580
And a DVD player.

37:58.580 --> 37:59.886
- What movie?
- Oh, wait for it.

38:02.149 --> 38:04.282
-"His Girl Friday."
- Oh, God. Love that movie.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.109
It's the perfect
newspaper movie.

38:06.109 --> 38:08.068
Agreed. I secretly wanted
to be Hildy Johnson.

38:08.068 --> 38:09.417
I've never heard of it.

38:09.417 --> 38:10.462
Prepare to have
your mind blown.

38:10.462 --> 38:12.725
1940. Cary Grant.
Rosalind Russell.

38:12.725 --> 38:13.769
Ralph Bellamy.

38:13.769 --> 38:15.858
Okay. I'm in.

38:15.858 --> 38:17.295
Yeah,
you're in, all right.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.992
Where's
the wine opener?

38:23.475 --> 38:24.737
Sylvie...

38:27.435 --> 38:29.872
I'm so sorry.

38:31.961 --> 38:33.702
The only thing
that matters to me

38:33.702 --> 38:37.271
is finding out
what happened to Gloria.

38:37.271 --> 38:41.319
If it was Gallahorn,
I need to know what happened.

38:43.059 --> 38:45.584
Wow.
She's such a strong woman.

38:45.584 --> 38:47.542
Life is so unfair.

38:49.501 --> 38:51.807
Test results.

38:51.807 --> 38:55.550
Hi, Helen. Any news?
Is it Gallahorn's?

38:55.550 --> 38:56.899
Then whose is it?

38:56.899 --> 38:57.987
It wasn't him?

38:59.685 --> 39:02.122
Sorry. Who?

39:02.122 --> 39:03.384
Wait, what?

39:03.384 --> 39:04.951
What? Who?

39:04.951 --> 39:06.387
You gotta be kidding.

39:06.387 --> 39:08.346
Okay, uh, thanks, Helen.

39:10.826 --> 39:12.088
Toby Crenshaw.

39:12.088 --> 39:13.351
Toby?

39:13.351 --> 39:16.484
Yeah. They're issuing
an arrest warrant.

39:18.443 --> 39:20.096
Stanley, hi!

39:20.096 --> 39:22.360
Gabriel, I hope
I'm not interrupting.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.884
You're not. As long as you don't
mind watching "His Friday Girl."

39:24.884 --> 39:26.712
Nope. Not it.
Reverse it.

39:26.712 --> 39:29.454
Sorry. "His Girl Friday."
We're having a movie night.

39:29.454 --> 39:32.413
Who are "we"?

39:32.413 --> 39:34.154
- We!
- We!

39:43.468 --> 39:45.252
Okay.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.951
Uh, wait. Um...

39:50.039 --> 39:51.911
I just--

39:53.608 --> 39:56.568
I wanted to say something.

39:56.568 --> 39:59.266
First of all,
you guys are all so nice.

39:59.266 --> 40:03.357
You're the best colleagues
I could ever imagine.

40:05.011 --> 40:06.534
I really wish
Eileen and Roz were here,

40:06.534 --> 40:08.710
but I guess I can call them.

40:08.710 --> 40:11.713
I just wanted to say that...

40:13.759 --> 40:16.152
I'm not coming back
to the paper.

40:17.415 --> 40:20.113
But I will miss you.

40:20.113 --> 40:21.941
Very much.

40:25.727 --> 40:27.163
Okay.

40:27.163 --> 40:29.383
Uh, let's watch the movie.

40:49.316 --> 40:54.016
âª If your heart

40:54.016 --> 40:56.497
âª Feels alone

40:56.497 --> 41:02.851
âª And nowhere you go

41:02.851 --> 41:07.116
âª Feels like home

41:07.116 --> 41:11.643
âª Think of me

41:11.643 --> 41:15.734
âª I'll be there for you
