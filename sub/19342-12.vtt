16:33.291 --> 16:36.458
A deliberate, criminal act

23:42.083 --> 23:43.875
I'm trying to decide

23:43.875 --> 23:45.625
how best to protect
my interests...

23:45.625 --> 23:45.750
Ah.

23:49.708 --> 23:51.250
I'm afraid I can't help.

23:51.250 --> 23:53.041
I'm engaged
by your husband.

23:53.041 --> 23:55.959
That brings with it,
uh, confidentiality, yes,

23:55.959 --> 23:57.542
but also loyalty.

23:57.542 --> 24:00.333
And there are strict rules
governing conflict

24:00.333 --> 24:03.542
that I cannot break, so...

24:09.667 --> 24:13.417
Then let's make this
an unofficial consultation.

24:15.125 --> 24:19.583
Are there things I can do today
to protect myself?

24:19.583 --> 24:23.250
Would I be wise to consider
extreme measures,

24:23.250 --> 24:25.959
separation, divorce?

24:25.959 --> 24:29.208
I'm going to have to ask you
to pick up the money

24:29.208 --> 24:31.417

back in your bag.

24:35.458 --> 24:37.750

officially or unofficially,

24:40.667 --> 24:45.208

or if they diverge.

24:50.291 --> 24:51.792

going on inside your head.

counsel for it elsewhere.

Okay.

you should've made that

27:26.667 --> 27:28.000
a little more clear to me,

27:28.000 --> 27:29.959
by letting me
crack some fucking heads

27:29.959 --> 27:30.917
when I was about to.

27:32.917 --> 27:35.500
I came here for two reasons.

27:35.500 --> 27:38.166
To be close to
the best prosecutor

27:38.166 --> 27:40.250
this office has ever known,

27:40.250 --> 27:42.375

27:42.375 --> 27:46.333
and to actually put the bad guys
in the goddamned hoosegow.

Well, now, there,
right there.

know that word

studied at my knee.

27:50.708 --> 27:53.875
Things changed,
so now I have, too.

27:55.750 --> 27:57.625
The job I've been offered

27:57.625 --> 28:00.166
will allow me to handle
big criminal defense cases,

28:00.166 --> 28:02.125
as I see fit.

28:02.125 --> 28:04.583
The best moves
I've made in my life

28:04.583 --> 28:08.166
have required the most
discipline, patience, and trust,

28:08.166 --> 28:11.000
so I ask you,
hold for a day.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.959
See how some things
shake out around here.

28:12.959 --> 28:17.333
Perhaps I can make you
an even more compelling offer.

28:18.208 --> 28:21.166
Wait.

28:21.166 --> 28:24.500
And then,
if you still decide to go,

28:24.500 --> 28:27.000
well,
it'll be with my blessing.

28:29.667 --> 28:32.083
I expected
to sit down with you,

28:32.083 --> 28:35.792

after we arrested your client.

28:35.792 --> 28:39.208

my intention to.

28:39.208 --> 28:41.708

We're here.

is interested in

reviving the immunity deal

28:47.625 --> 28:50.834
that we discussed
a while back.

28:50.834 --> 28:53.542

you passed on?

28:53.542 --> 28:56.000

is no longer alive.

Robert Axelrod.
You're under arrest.

50:18.208 --> 50:20.458
Let's go, Bud.
Let go.

50:50.500 --> 50:51.166
It happened?

50:54.542 --> 50:56.583
Pull the trigger.

51:03.959 --> 51:05.542
He made you CIO.

51:05.542 --> 51:06.250
He did.

51:09.625 --> 51:11.291
That's a good fucking call.

51:11.291 --> 51:13.875
Let me know how I can help.

51:15.792 --> 51:17.959
These are our investors
you should contact.

51:17.959 --> 51:19.875
Tell them they'll have
their capital back

51:19.875 --> 51:20.834
by end of day tomorrow.

51:20.834 --> 51:23.291
Tell them we're going to
shoot the lights out

51:23.291 --> 51:24.625
with Axe's personal money,

51:24.625 --> 51:26.542
and we'll be calling for
a pitch meeting

51:26.542 --> 51:28.875
as soon as Axe is clear
of all this bullshit.

51:28.875 --> 51:30.625
Because that's what it is.
Bullshit.

51:30.625 --> 51:31.875
Say all that.

51:33.667 --> 51:34.792
On it.

52:03.917 --> 52:07.875
♪ dramatic music  ♪

52:19.875 --> 52:22.417
Keep facing the wall.

52:40.166 --> 52:42.291
You can turn around.

52:48.667 --> 52:51.667
I always figured the worst part
about being locked up

52:51.667 --> 52:53.000
would be the company.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.583
You've just
proven me right.

52:54.583 --> 52:57.041
Oh, I bet the worst
is yet to come.

52:57.041 --> 52:58.959
You made a mistake
coming here.

52:58.959 --> 53:02.166
Really?
Yeah.

53:02.166 --> 53:04.333
Once Boyd
showed up at my door,

53:04.333 --> 53:06.458
I knew you were in this,

53:06.458 --> 53:08.542
that you'd used him
to hook me in.

53:08.542 --> 53:10.041
Yeah.
He went off book there.

53:10.041 --> 53:12.333
And you just
affirmed the whole thing,

53:12.333 --> 53:14.000
that you entrapped me.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.792
I trapped  you.

53:16.792 --> 53:19.291
Oh, there's an important
legal difference.

53:20.500 --> 53:23.250
Well, I won't be in here
for long.

53:23.250 --> 53:25.542
No. A macher  like you?

53:25.542 --> 53:27.583
You'll make bail.

53:27.583 --> 53:32.000
But it won't feel like freedom
for a long time,

53:32.000 --> 53:33.625
maybe ever again.

53:33.625 --> 53:36.792
I might have underestimated
a part of your character.

53:36.792 --> 53:37.750
Really?
Yeah.

53:37.750 --> 53:40.708
I didn't realize
just how desperate you were

53:40.708 --> 53:41.959
to feel like a man.

53:41.959 --> 53:44.083
You sacrificed over,

53:44.083 --> 53:48.708
what, 27 million dollars,

53:48.708 --> 53:52.041
every penny you had,
just to catch me?

53:52.041 --> 53:54.417
And almost broke your father
and your best friend

53:54.417 --> 53:56.375
in the process.

53:56.375 --> 53:58.708
I may be ruthless
when it comes to dealmaking,

53:58.708 --> 54:01.625
but you're as trigger happy
as Machine Gun Kelly,

54:01.625 --> 54:03.166
spraying everyone
in sight.

54:03.166 --> 54:04.708
Well, that may be.

54:04.708 --> 54:06.125
But, I'll tell you,

54:06.125 --> 54:09.375
when I think about
all that money I lost,

54:09.375 --> 54:11.375
just to see you
in this place,

54:11.375 --> 54:15.375
all I can say is...
worth it!

54:15.375 --> 54:18.208
I hope so.

54:18.208 --> 54:20.125
Because the moment
I walk out that door,

54:20.125 --> 54:22.625
I am never coming back,

54:22.625 --> 54:23.750
even if I have to spend
a hundred...

54:23.750 --> 54:28.166
fuck it, a thousand times
what you did, to make sure.

54:28.166 --> 54:30.083
Tell yourself that.

54:30.083 --> 54:32.125
Maybe that'll help you
on all those sleepless nights

54:32.125 --> 54:35.375
you have staring you
in the face.

54:35.375 --> 54:37.583
Nah, it won't matter.

54:37.583 --> 54:39.834
No amount of money
is gonna erase the video

54:39.834 --> 54:43.291
of all those lackeys
you poisoned,

54:43.291 --> 54:45.417
or wipe out
the trading records

54:45.417 --> 54:49.250
of your tampering
with the stock,

54:49.250 --> 54:52.500
manipulating the market.

54:52.500 --> 54:54.083
You let your hatred of me

54:54.083 --> 54:56.792
put everything you hold dear
in jeopardy.

55:03.750 --> 55:05.417
I'm gonna find it.

55:08.417 --> 55:10.166
Whatever it is.

55:10.166 --> 55:12.917
Whatever thread
you left behind,

55:12.917 --> 55:15.125
however small...

55:15.125 --> 55:18.959
the one that threatens
everything you are.

55:18.959 --> 55:21.291
We both know
it's out there.

55:21.291 --> 55:24.000
You know
exactly what it is.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
You were talking about
sleepless nights.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.583
It's what you'll wake up

55:29.583 --> 55:32.625
thinking about
in the dark, shaking,

55:32.625 --> 55:34.208
because I'm gonna find it.

55:34.208 --> 55:36.458
You know I will.

55:36.458 --> 55:40.166
And I am gonna pull on it,
and I'm gonna pull on it

55:40.166 --> 55:43.000
until your whole fucking world
unravels.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.834
And when I am done,
you won't be governor.

55:45.834 --> 55:48.000
You won't be
the U.S. Attorney.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.125
You might not even be
an attorney at all.

55:51.125 --> 55:54.417
Yeah, I might go down
behind all of this,

55:54.417 --> 55:57.417
but one thing is for sure,

55:57.417 --> 56:01.500
you are gonna be
right there next to me.

56:06.417 --> 56:07.625
Wow.

56:09.083 --> 56:10.667
