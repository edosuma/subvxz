MARCO:
Where's my family?

00:04.179 --> 00:07.238
SONYA: Gus, do you know a person
named Kenneth Hasting?

00:07.473 --> 00:10.205
GUS: Mr. Hasting?
The guy who works with Alma?

00:10.534 --> 00:12.498
KENNETH:
You have a beautiful family, Marco.

00:12.533 --> 00:13.872
MARCO:
Where are they?

00:13.907 --> 00:15.320
KENNETH:
With me.

00:16.754 --> 00:19.493
Hold on to this very tight.

00:21.815 --> 00:22.820
ALMA:
Oh, God.

00:22.855 --> 00:24.510
KENNETH:
Now, careful.

00:26.112 --> 00:27.273
Take your hand off that lever,

00:27.308 --> 00:30.298
you only have five seconds
to say good-bye to your daughters.

ADRIANA:
Daniel Frye.

00:59.085 --> 01:00.844
GUS:
Why would Mr. Hasting do this?

01:01.956 --> 01:03.479
SONYA:
It doesn't make sense.

01:03.500 --> 01:04.501
GUS:
What?

01:36.368 --> 01:38.157
GUS:
Where are we going?

01:45.533 --> 01:47.416
Why are you doing this?

01:54.678 --> 01:56.520
KENNETH:
How old are you?

01:58.389 --> 02:00.183
GUS:
Nineteen.

02:00.681 --> 02:02.333
(Sniffles)

02:04.204 --> 02:06.493
KENNETH:
Caleb would have been 17.

02:08.733 --> 02:11.020
You could have been friends.

02:12.789 --> 02:14.967
Caleb and Gus.

02:16.451 --> 02:17.389
(Gus sniffles)

02:17.424 --> 02:19.781
Everything could have been...

02:22.322 --> 02:24.045
different.

02:28.775 --> 02:31.095
GUS:
What are you going to do?

02:31.999 --> 02:33.670
KENNETH:
To you?

02:35.927 --> 02:37.507
GUS:
Yes.

02:42.961 --> 02:45.916
KENNETH: For Caleb, it was the sins
of the mother.

02:48.099 --> 02:50.490
For you, the father.

02:53.117 --> 02:54.975
GUS:
He's a good person.

02:56.815 --> 02:58.627
KENNETH:
Is he a good dad?

02:59.005 --> 03:00.343
(Gus sobs softly)

03:00.839 --> 03:02.820
GUS:
He wants to be.

03:06.575 --> 03:09.705
KENNETH: And it's the thought
that counts, right?

Hang on a second.

04:10.942 --> 04:12.482
SONYA:
Marco.

04:12.642 --> 04:14.252
He took Gus.

04:14.764 --> 04:20.608
Gray sedan.
2-E-O. 2-E-O.

2-E-O.

MARCO:
Shh. Take it easy.

04:24.941 --> 04:26.492
WADE:
I'll stay with her.

04:26.527 --> 04:29.216
We're working on where
he could've taken your son.

04:29.545 --> 04:31.575
- MARCO: How did this happen?
- WADE: I don't know!

04:31.650 --> 04:33.480
We're gonna find him.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.417
Come on.

04:39.445 --> 04:40.979
ADRIANA:
Daniel!

04:46.874 --> 04:48.954
So much for the wagon, huh.

04:51.147 --> 04:52.659
FRYE:
Oops.

04:56.506 --> 04:57.981
(Frye scoffs)

04:58.641 --> 05:00.469
It's, uh...

05:02.477 --> 05:05.738
"Comfort the afflicted
and afflict the comfortable."

05:05.773 --> 05:07.216
ADRIANA:
You can't just go AWOL.

05:07.251 --> 05:09.855
- FRYE: You ever heard of it?
- ADRIANA: I've heard it.

05:09.890 --> 05:11.903
FRYE:
A good journalist...

05:12.238 --> 05:15.183
comforts the afflicted
and afflicts the comfortable.

05:15.749 --> 05:19.056
Finley Peter Dunne,
he said that.

05:19.091 --> 05:23.405
I wrote this when I was...
(blows raspberry) twenty.

05:23.919 --> 05:25.656
ADRIANA:
So be a good journalist.

05:25.691 --> 05:29.072
Quit this shit.
You were doing well.

05:29.864 --> 05:31.785
(Frye sighs)

05:34.867 --> 05:36.316
(Chuckles)

05:36.978 --> 05:40.022
FRYE: You know why I ended up
in my car with that bomb?

05:42.337 --> 05:43.985
ADRIANA:
No.

05:58.652 --> 06:01.526
FRYE: I helped kill
David Tate's wife and kid.

06:06.903 --> 06:08.607
ADRIANA:
Explain.

06:09.716 --> 06:11.886
FRYE:
Six years ago...

06:12.842 --> 06:14.884
and I was, uh...

06:15.119 --> 06:19.057
I was hanging out
with Santi Sol Jr.

06:20.618 --> 06:22.859
And we needed more coke,

06:24.266 --> 06:29.024
so he went back across the bridge
to get some.

06:32.274 --> 06:37.199
He clipped that woman's car.
He just kept going.

06:39.373 --> 06:41.074
ADRIANA:
He did, not you.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.947
FRYE:
Yeah, but this...

06:42.982 --> 06:45.834
this is the part where I become
a shitty human being.

06:47.472 --> 06:49.905
See, instead of, say,
I don't know, testifying,

06:49.940 --> 06:52.244
instead of comforting
the afflicted,

06:52.409 --> 06:55.664
I just let Santi Jr.'s dad
buy me off.

06:57.366 --> 06:59.363
He just came to me one day

07:00.947 --> 07:04.202
and he said,
"Daniel, I have a big cock,

07:04.237 --> 07:09.506
I have a newspaper in Houston.
I want you to work for me."

07:10.730 --> 07:13.576
- ADRIANA: And you said yes.
- FRYE: I said yes.

07:15.062 --> 07:18.349
I said yes so fa...
I didn't even hesitate.

07:18.384 --> 07:20.486
I said yes in two seconds flat.

07:20.521 --> 07:23.424
ADRIANA: That's why Santi pretended
he didn't know you.

07:23.459 --> 07:25.006
FRYE:
Oh, yeah?

07:25.678 --> 07:27.753
He big-timed me?

07:27.788 --> 07:29.478
(Scoffs)

07:29.513 --> 07:31.383
Cooze.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.667
ADRIANA: I hate talking to you
when you're drunk.

07:33.702 --> 07:34.494
(Frye clears throat, coughs)

07:34.529 --> 07:36.225
FRYE:
Oh, well.

07:40.243 --> 07:42.003
ADRIANA:
You can change.

07:42.852 --> 07:47.006
FRYE: I tried...
but obviously, I can't.

07:52.495 --> 07:55.949
ADRIANA: There's a meeting tomorrow,
7:00 a.m., down the street.

07:57.579 --> 08:00.013
FRYE:
12 Steps can suck my dick.

08:01.709 --> 08:03.679
ADRIANA:
Let people help you.

08:04.669 --> 08:06.989
Meet me. I'll go with you.

08:37.275 --> 08:39.614
FRYE: You might be
my only real friend.

08:39.649 --> 08:41.755
(Chuckles ruefully)

08:41.789 --> 08:44.043
ADRIANA:
That's pathetic.

08:48.339 --> 08:50.596
7:00 a.m.

09:14.441 --> 09:15.666
(Sobbing)

09:15.701 --> 09:17.917
GUS: You texted me
saying you were Zina.

09:18.150 --> 09:19.244
KENNETH:
Right.

09:19.279 --> 09:21.916
GUS: And you told me
to give him another chance.

09:21.951 --> 09:23.390
KENNETH:
I did.

09:23.425 --> 09:24.521
(Gus sobbing)

09:24.556 --> 09:26.427
GUS:
So I do not understand.

09:26.462 --> 09:27.978
(Stun gun crackling)

09:31.468 --> 09:33.730
KENNETH:
Neither did Caleb.

09:34.196 --> 09:36.236
(Kenneth clears throat)

09:49.879 --> 09:53.809
(Indistinct radio transmission)

09:57.938 --> 09:59.669
- MARCO: Alma.
- ALMA: Marco.

10:22.173 --> 10:23.526
MARCO:
Alma...

11:33.998 --> 11:35.224
MARCO:
Alma...

11:43.107 --> 11:44.440
DOCTOR:
You're lucky to be alive.

11:45.434 --> 11:48.791
That laceration is long, but it
didn't damage any of the organs.

11:49.845 --> 11:51.285
SONYA:
And my arm?

11:51.320 --> 11:53.857
DOCTOR: You fractured the radius.
Badly.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.629
SONYA:
I can't move it.

11:55.985 --> 11:57.496
DOCTOR:
Can you feel it?

12:00.088 --> 12:03.283
That's just the swelling.
How's the pain?

12:04.131 --> 12:05.912
SONYA:
It's there.

12:06.589 --> 12:08.233
- KITTY: Hey.
- SONYA: Hey.

12:08.268 --> 12:09.923
KITTY:
We brought you some things.

12:09.958 --> 12:11.440
WADE:
What's the prognosis?

12:11.475 --> 12:13.275
DOCTOR: Well, she's gonna need
surgery on the arm.

12:14.728 --> 12:16.792
SONYA: That's not possible
anytime soon.

12:16.827 --> 12:19.011
DOCTOR: You can't leave Sonya.
You nearly died.

12:19.046 --> 12:20.849
SONYA: I thought you said
I was lucky.

12:20.884 --> 12:22.516
DOCTOR:
I said lucky to be alive.

12:22.592 --> 12:24.878
WADE: Doc, could we have a minute,
please?

12:25.512 --> 12:27.412
- DOCTOR: Sure.
- WADE: All right.

12:28.074 --> 12:29.943
KITTY: You know,
maybe you ought to listen to her.

12:29.978 --> 12:31.460
SONYA:
Anything on Gus?

12:32.668 --> 12:33.962
WADE:
Nope.

12:33.997 --> 12:36.743
Marco's getting Alma
somewhere safe.

12:42.479 --> 12:44.270
SONYA: Can you help me
with these?

12:44.305 --> 12:46.641
KITTY: Sure, babe.
Sit yourself down.

12:46.676 --> 12:48.396
WADE:
You should stay here.

12:48.551 --> 12:51.649
SONYA: You know I can't do that.
Gus is alive.

12:51.684 --> 12:53.506
WADE:
Why do you say that?

12:54.018 --> 12:56.220
SONYA:
He wants Marco to suffer.

12:56.255 --> 12:58.048
He wants to draw it out.

13:00.641 --> 13:03.107
KITTY: Vicodin.
It-it's good.

13:03.576 --> 13:06.547
(Sonya groaning)

13:08.521 --> 13:10.044
NICK:
Okay.

13:10.118 --> 13:13.459
Okay, thanks, Shaun,
for trusting us with that.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.996
We have a new face with us
this morning.

13:18.498 --> 13:21.500
FRYE: You want me to do...
do the whole thing?

13:21.567 --> 13:24.302
- NICK: Yeah, yeah.
- FRYE: My God.

13:24.370 --> 13:27.239
(Laughs, snorts)

13:27.306 --> 13:29.707
Um... okay.

13:30.209 --> 13:32.249
My name is Daniel.

13:32.484 --> 13:35.614
If you almost call me Dan,
then I'll kill you.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.568
Stripes.

13:38.017 --> 13:39.852
Um, thank you for telling me

13:39.919 --> 13:44.089
that deeply depressing story,
Shaun.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.084
You actually make me feel
really good about myself,

13:47.194 --> 13:49.374
so that was awesome.

13:50.414 --> 13:55.164
Um, I had my last drink
about 90 minutes ago

13:55.199 --> 13:57.333
and it was delicious.
(Laughs)

14:05.244 --> 14:07.345
(Sighs)
Okay.

14:07.413 --> 14:10.415
(Sighs)

14:10.484 --> 14:13.285
Um...
(Sniffs)

14:13.352 --> 14:15.052
(Crying)

14:15.155 --> 14:17.022
I don't know how you guys
do what you do.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.602
It just seems kind of impossible
to me.

14:21.787 --> 14:23.570
I tried.

14:24.215 --> 14:26.155
I try so hard, and then just,

14:26.194 --> 14:27.535
I get so far
and then shit the bed

14:27.616 --> 14:29.340
and something happens,
and I just get hammered,

14:29.412 --> 14:32.191
and life is so much better
when you're hammered.

14:34.808 --> 14:36.809
(Groans)

14:36.976 --> 14:39.511
But I have...

14:39.579 --> 14:43.401
I have cool people in my life
who think I can change.

14:45.081 --> 14:47.262
I see a lot of cool people...

14:49.114 --> 14:50.831
thank you...

14:51.624 --> 14:55.360
who let me believe in myself.

14:55.428 --> 14:58.063
(Clears throat)

14:59.231 --> 15:01.499
So, thanks for that.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.369
Oh, God.

15:04.437 --> 15:05.403
(Clears throat, sniffles)

15:05.471 --> 15:07.572
So, whatever.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.709
I don't have a watch
or anything, but, uh, look.

15:10.777 --> 15:16.115
It is 8:22...

15:16.182 --> 15:20.252
and, uh, from this point on
I'm gonna give it a shot.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.290
I don't know
how it's gonna go, but...

15:24.990 --> 15:26.959
shit, I'll give it a shot.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.625
(All clapping)

15:45.725 --> 15:47.756
KENNETH:
How touching that all was.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.715
(Frye yells)

15:57.456 --> 16:02.353
(Engine revving, tires squeal)

16:13.406 --> 16:14.442
COOPER:
All right, gang.

16:14.553 --> 16:16.628
This is the haul
from David Tate's apartment.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.243
One pile per victim.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.812
Be quick, but be diligent.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.914
MARCO:
How does that help my son?

16:21.981 --> 16:24.016
COOPER:
We know he's methodical.

16:24.083 --> 16:26.251
If there's a plan for your boy,
it's in here somewhere.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.619
MARCO:
You don't know that.

16:27.786 --> 16:29.321
COOPER:
I know it's our best bet.

16:29.388 --> 16:31.069
SONYA:
Anything on the license plate?

16:31.138 --> 16:33.075
COOPER:
No, ma'am, not yet.

16:33.835 --> 16:36.069
- You okay?
- SONYA: Yeah.

16:37.537 --> 16:40.025
COOPER: All right.
Got Daniel Frye's car bomb here.

16:40.096 --> 16:42.127
Gedman's murder.
Dr. Meadow's murder.

16:42.262 --> 16:44.097
MARCO:
You're bleeding.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.540
SONYA:
Yes.

16:50.419 --> 16:53.267
MARCO:
Everything is coming apart.

16:57.413 --> 16:58.941
(Sighs)

16:58.976 --> 17:00.853
SONYA:
I'm sorry about Gus.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.322
I'm sorry
I couldn't protect him.

17:05.084 --> 17:07.157
MARCO:
There was nothing you could do.

17:07.492 --> 17:09.861
SONYA:
But it was...

17:09.928 --> 17:11.219
It was my job,

17:11.290 --> 17:12.699
and you asked me
to keep him safe,

17:12.733 --> 17:16.501
and I, and I didn't...
I'm sorry. I tried.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.522
WADE: (Snaps his fingers)
Come here.

17:23.442 --> 17:24.976
SONYA:
What are these?

17:25.042 --> 17:26.984
COOPER: These are documents
we can't connect...

17:27.023 --> 17:28.965
WADE:
When did you last sleep?

17:30.463 --> 17:31.518
MARCO:
Uh, who knows?

17:31.617 --> 17:33.738
WADE:
You're not yourself.

17:33.819 --> 17:35.387
MARCO:
I'm fine.

17:35.754 --> 17:38.022
WADE:
I'm required to ask.

17:38.090 --> 17:41.125
Are you sure you don't need
to step away?

17:46.331 --> 17:49.100
What would you do
if someone had your son?

17:49.936 --> 17:51.976
SONYA:
Uniforms found the car.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.188
WADE: Go. Go.
Go, go, go, go.

18:00.713 --> 18:03.314
MARCO:
No, no, no, no, no.

18:13.580 --> 18:15.483
OFFICER: Gravedigger found it
out here an hour ago.

18:15.494 --> 18:18.096
- SONYA: Nothing inside?
- OFFICER: Manual, receipts,

18:18.163 --> 18:20.765
a few things in the glove box.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.912
SONYA:
Marco!

18:53.699 --> 18:55.403
Marco.

18:56.502 --> 18:57.973
It's not him.

18:58.004 --> 19:00.498
It's not Gus.
It's just a grave!

19:00.571 --> 19:02.678
He's playing with you.

19:05.110 --> 19:07.208
MARCO:
I am a man.

19:07.284 --> 19:09.113
A father.

19:09.191 --> 19:11.749
This is not a game!

19:11.884 --> 19:14.110
SONYA: I know.
Come on, get up.

19:14.189 --> 19:16.791
(Both panting)

19:16.822 --> 19:19.503
We won't stop, okay?

19:20.515 --> 19:22.297
Let's go.

19:22.379 --> 19:24.341
(Marco grunts)

19:36.784 --> 19:39.885
RAY: Okay.
Kind of a curveball.

19:39.954 --> 19:42.445
CHARLOTTE:
A curve-up-my-ass ball.

19:42.689 --> 19:46.292
RAY: More like a slider then,
I guess.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.850
CHARLOTTE:
He left me nothing.

19:47.892 --> 19:50.074
RAY: He left you the house
and land.

19:50.112 --> 19:53.136
CHARLOTTE: Kate got the money,
the cars, the art, the furniture.

19:53.173 --> 19:55.913
RAY: I repeat, you got the land
and the tunnel.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.046
KATE: That went super well,
I thought.

19:58.117 --> 20:00.953
CHARLOTTE: You did a really good job
of turning him against me, Kate.

20:00.993 --> 20:02.721
(Kate laughs)

20:04.278 --> 20:07.768
KATE:
So... this one time,

20:07.841 --> 20:10.237
my dad calls me up
in the middle of the night.

20:10.308 --> 20:12.949
And I-I ask him what's up,
you know.

20:13.068 --> 20:17.983
He says, "Oh... it's just another day
married to an idiot."

20:18.258 --> 20:20.084
That was eight years ago.

20:20.121 --> 20:22.835
Pretty sure you turned him
against you.

20:23.363 --> 20:24.883
Bye, whore.

20:24.962 --> 20:27.051
RAY:
<i>Adiós</i>, Kate.

20:27.168 --> 20:29.259
Hey. Forget her.

20:29.264 --> 20:30.809
Look at me, forget her.

20:30.904 --> 20:32.953
We've got the tunnel.
Okay?

20:33.007 --> 20:34.496
We solve the Tim problem
this afternoon,

20:34.530 --> 20:37.885
we put the fear of God in him,
and then we'll be fine.

20:39.951 --> 20:42.272
(Indistinct conversations)

20:43.181 --> 20:44.769
ADRIANA:
Lieutenant Wade?

20:45.252 --> 20:47.008
WADE: Yeah, we're kind of busy
right now.

20:47.025 --> 20:49.299
ADRIANA:
Daniel Frye is missing.

20:50.418 --> 20:51.809
WADE:
He's an addict, right?

20:51.847 --> 20:53.005
ADRIANA:
It's not like that.

20:53.093 --> 20:54.705
We were at an AA meeting,
and I don't...

20:54.745 --> 20:57.105
I don't think it was him
that drove his car away.

20:57.247 --> 20:59.040
WADE:
Yeah? Who was it?

20:59.060 --> 21:01.019
ADRIANA: Daniel helped cover up
the hit-and-run.

21:01.026 --> 21:02.746
David Tate's family.

21:02.793 --> 21:06.680
He told me. That's why
he's been targeted all this time.

21:17.451 --> 21:19.088
MARCO:
Parking ticket.

21:19.160 --> 21:21.729
From the morning the bodies
were left on the bridge.

21:22.177 --> 21:23.599
SONYA:
Not part of the plan.

21:23.637 --> 21:25.924
MARCO: This is not
his apartment address.

21:25.965 --> 21:27.198
- It's something else.
- SONYA: Come on.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.241
We'll call it in on the way.

22:06.968 --> 22:09.496
GUS: (Muffled)
Hello? Hello?

22:11.471 --> 22:13.206
Hello?

22:14.074 --> 22:16.004
(Water splashing)

22:18.484 --> 22:20.446
(Muffled shouting)

22:23.083 --> 22:25.852
GUS:
Is anybody there?!

22:32.092 --> 22:34.760
DORA: I'm sure of it.
He visits one of our residents.

22:34.829 --> 22:37.022
I'd say every few weeks.

22:37.197 --> 22:39.699
- MARCO: Which resident?
- DORA: Mr. Chambers.

22:39.766 --> 22:42.790
- He's probably in the parlor.
- MARCO: Thank you.

22:43.504 --> 22:45.805
WALTER:
He's a nice man.

22:45.873 --> 22:48.574
Warm. Kind.

22:48.642 --> 22:50.643
MARCO:
Do you know who he is?

22:53.013 --> 22:54.780
WALTER:
Of course.

22:54.849 --> 22:57.329
He's my father.

22:58.485 --> 23:00.887
(Marco sighs)

23:06.327 --> 23:09.162
SONYA: Walter Chambers has
a home address on file.

23:09.230 --> 23:10.263
(Marco sighs)

23:10.331 --> 23:13.799
MARCO: David once said
his uncle had Alzheimer's.

23:13.868 --> 23:15.969
SONYA:
David Tate was here that day.

23:16.036 --> 23:17.879
Come on.

23:28.182 --> 23:31.050
(Door alarm chiming)

23:35.914 --> 23:37.957
(Chiming stops)

23:46.400 --> 23:48.601
SONYA:
What are you doing?

23:50.738 --> 23:53.439
MARCO:
What if we can't find him?

23:53.507 --> 23:54.840
SONYA:
We will.

23:54.909 --> 23:57.277
MARCO:
You can't say that.

24:10.557 --> 24:15.597
MARCO: We... hadn't really
talked for years,

24:15.632 --> 24:18.798
and then suddenly
he was back in my life.

24:19.692 --> 24:22.043
We just talked about...

24:23.804 --> 24:27.741
how I wasn't there for him
enough.

24:28.442 --> 24:32.440
And how I'd try to...

24:32.475 --> 24:34.713
do better.

24:34.781 --> 24:36.793
(Sonya sighs)

24:36.867 --> 24:38.833
SONYA:
Tate set that up, too.

24:39.053 --> 24:41.321
MARCO:
Still.

24:41.388 --> 24:43.360
And now I'm gonna...

24:44.350 --> 24:46.597
and now
I'm gonna lose him again?

24:48.128 --> 24:51.545
SONYA:
I can't say we'll find him,

24:51.616 --> 24:54.326
but you can't say we won't.

24:54.361 --> 24:56.989
MARCO:
What if he's not inside?

24:58.072 --> 25:00.537
SONYA:
We'll keep looking.

25:03.583 --> 25:05.584
(Marco sighs)

25:06.105 --> 25:08.323
(Sighs heavily)

25:17.055 --> 25:19.627
SONYA: El Paso PD.
Open the door!

25:42.380 --> 25:44.781
(Marco sighs)

25:52.024 --> 25:55.046
(Metallic creaking)

26:04.502 --> 26:07.661
SONYA: That's where he kept
Cristina's legs.

26:10.008 --> 26:14.045
(Phone ringing)

26:14.112 --> 26:15.546
MARCO:
Gus?

26:15.613 --> 26:16.981
KENNETH:
No.

26:17.049 --> 26:20.685
MARCO:
Jesus, David.

26:20.752 --> 26:23.020
KENNETH: He's a good-looking kid...
Gus.

26:23.088 --> 26:26.023
MARCO: Leave him alone.
Take it out on me.

26:26.091 --> 26:28.442
KENNETH: Well, isn't that
what I'm doing?

26:29.394 --> 26:31.862
MARCO: Let me talk to him
at least.

26:32.430 --> 26:34.839
KENNETH:
That's not possible.

26:35.633 --> 26:37.356
MARCO:
Is he alive?

26:37.391 --> 26:38.903
KENNETH:
For now.

26:38.970 --> 26:40.270
(Marco sighs)

26:40.338 --> 26:42.039
I thought we'd get together.

26:42.107 --> 26:44.041
MARCO:
Why are you doing this?

26:44.109 --> 26:47.154
KENNETH: Because I'm angry,
and I want to talk about it.

26:48.446 --> 26:50.715
MARCO:
All right. Fine.

26:50.782 --> 26:52.049
Where?

26:52.117 --> 26:54.446
KENNETH:
Where are you now?

26:56.121 --> 26:58.353
MARCO:
At your uncle's house.

26:59.638 --> 27:01.883
Hello?

27:02.861 --> 27:03.981
KENNETH:
You actually remembered

27:04.023 --> 27:06.138
something
I told you about myself.

27:06.464 --> 27:08.599
MARCO:
We found the freezer.

27:08.666 --> 27:10.101
KENNETH:
We?

27:10.168 --> 27:12.569
MARCO: Yes.
Sonya's here with me.

27:12.637 --> 27:14.105
KENNETH:
Really?

27:14.172 --> 27:15.873
How is she?

27:15.941 --> 27:17.274
Probably pretty pale.

27:17.342 --> 27:19.143
MARCO:
She's fine.

27:19.211 --> 27:20.544
KENNETH:
I've been meaning to ask her

27:20.612 --> 27:23.564
how she enjoyed getting to know
Jack Childress.

27:24.015 --> 27:27.952
That man has some batshit theories
on the border, doesn't he?

27:28.019 --> 27:30.387
MARCO: Where are we meeting,
David?

27:30.455 --> 27:31.255
KENNETH:
Get in your car.

27:31.322 --> 27:34.258
I'll call you in 60 seconds,
give you directions.

27:34.325 --> 27:36.459
- MARCO: All right.
- KENNETH: Come alone.

27:36.494 --> 27:39.263
Entirely alone.
Leave her.

27:39.330 --> 27:40.798
MARCO:
I will.

27:40.866 --> 27:41.799
SONYA:
You can't do that.

27:41.867 --> 27:43.734
You're doing exactly
what he wants.

27:43.802 --> 27:45.402
- MARCO: Give me your gun.
- SONYA: No.

27:45.470 --> 27:47.071
- MARCO: Please.
- SONYA: No.

27:47.139 --> 27:49.473
If you kill him, you...
you're gonna end up in prison.

27:49.540 --> 27:52.276
MARCO:
Sonya, I need your gun.

27:52.343 --> 27:54.344
Please.

27:58.416 --> 28:00.311
MARCO:
Thank you.

28:01.219 --> 28:03.020
Don't tell anyone where I went.

28:03.088 --> 28:04.421
SONYA:
What do I say?

28:04.489 --> 28:08.192
MARCO: Just... that I got a call,
and, uh... I left you here.

28:08.260 --> 28:10.294
- SONYA: I can't lie to Hank.
- MARCO: Oh, yes, you can.

28:10.361 --> 28:11.962
- SONYA: No, I can't.
- MARCO: It's easy.

28:12.030 --> 28:12.797
(Phone ringing)

28:12.864 --> 28:14.799
Do it for me.
All right?

28:14.866 --> 28:16.801
Hello?

28:16.868 --> 28:19.236
(Breathing hard)

28:29.380 --> 28:31.782
(Groans)

28:44.185 --> 28:48.163
(Water running in pipes)

29:01.079 --> 29:03.147
(Breathing hard)

29:03.215 --> 29:04.882
SONYA:
I need a ride.

29:25.971 --> 29:27.071
RAY:
Timbo.

29:27.138 --> 29:30.040
TIM:
Ray! Char.

29:30.108 --> 29:32.776
So what are we doing here?

29:32.844 --> 29:34.745
RAY: (Chuckles)
What do you mean by that?

29:34.812 --> 29:35.579
TIM:
Dude.

29:35.646 --> 29:37.614
We're on freakin' Mars,
right now.

29:37.682 --> 29:39.884
CHARLOTTE: We thought a remote area
would be best.

29:39.951 --> 29:40.951
TIM:
Okay.

29:41.019 --> 29:43.453
Where's the <i>dinero</i>.

29:45.691 --> 29:47.057
TIM:
Whoa, whoa.

29:47.125 --> 29:49.059
Look, what-what's going on,
crazies?

29:49.127 --> 29:50.094
RAY:
Get on your knees.

29:50.161 --> 29:51.128
TIM:
Wh...?

29:51.196 --> 29:53.563
(Tim grunts)

29:54.053 --> 29:55.478
CHARLOTTE:
We found this.

29:55.516 --> 29:57.210
TIM:
What the heck is it?

29:57.246 --> 29:59.085
RAY:
It's a transmitter, dipshit.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.798
It was in one of those guns.

30:00.833 --> 30:02.585
TIM: Aw, no, no...
That's-that's nothing.

30:02.620 --> 30:04.041
They put those things in the...
at-at the factory.

30:04.109 --> 30:05.042
RAY:
Don't even try.

30:05.110 --> 30:07.477
CHARLOTTE: You have no idea
the shit storm you caused me.

30:07.545 --> 30:09.046
TIM:
Okay, what.

30:09.114 --> 30:12.505
That lady you muff-dove
come-come after you, what?

30:13.567 --> 30:15.852
RAY: I don't even know
what that means.

30:17.347 --> 30:19.156
CHARLOTTE:
What part of the government?

30:19.224 --> 30:20.224
TIM:
Excuse me?

30:20.292 --> 30:22.326
CHARLOTTE:
For whom are you an informant?

30:22.394 --> 30:24.280
(Tim scoffs)

30:24.315 --> 30:27.029
I will get in my truck, Tim,
and I will run you over.

30:27.064 --> 30:28.966
- I swear.
- TIM: Okay, okay, look.

30:29.034 --> 30:31.409
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

30:31.444 --> 30:33.279
Guys, I just got caught up
in something.

30:33.314 --> 30:34.238
CHARLOTTE:
Are you wired right now?

30:34.306 --> 30:36.240
TIM: No. No, no, no, no.
No, see?

30:36.308 --> 30:38.242
They-they-they don't even know
where I am.

30:38.310 --> 30:40.232
ATF, they're, like,
so disorganized,

30:40.267 --> 30:42.050
it's like they-they forget
about me.

30:42.085 --> 30:43.914
CHARLOTTE:
The ATF?

30:43.982 --> 30:46.350
(Tim sighs)

30:48.642 --> 30:50.675
Shoot him.

30:54.390 --> 30:55.759
RAY: I thought you said
we were gonna scare him.

30:55.827 --> 30:58.195
CHARLOTTE:
I changed my mind.

31:01.291 --> 31:02.809
Do it.

31:02.844 --> 31:05.034
RAY:
I don't think I can.

31:06.361 --> 31:08.088
We used to play kickball
together.

31:08.123 --> 31:10.841
TIM: Guys, it's... come on,
Char, dude, it's me.

31:10.908 --> 31:14.378
We-we-we took an RV
to our prom together.

31:14.446 --> 31:17.348
RAY:
He has a point.

31:17.415 --> 31:19.183
TIM:
Blue satin.

31:19.250 --> 31:22.819
Big white flower in your hair.

31:22.887 --> 31:23.854
CHARLOTTE:
Give it to me.

31:23.921 --> 31:24.855
RAY:
Char...

31:24.922 --> 31:26.857
TIM: Wha...?
No, whoa, whoa...

31:26.924 --> 31:29.093
(Gunshot, Tim and Ray yell)

31:32.430 --> 31:33.364
Please...

31:33.431 --> 31:34.365
(Gunshots)

31:34.432 --> 31:35.799
RAY:
No, no!

31:35.867 --> 31:37.468
No, no, no, no, no!

31:37.535 --> 31:39.536
No, no, no, no, no, no!

31:39.604 --> 31:41.538
Oh, no!

31:41.606 --> 31:42.906
CHARLOTTE:
Calm down.

31:42.974 --> 31:44.074
RAY:
Calm down?

31:44.142 --> 31:47.211
You killed Tim.

31:47.278 --> 31:49.390
He was our buddy!

31:58.195 --> 31:59.899
KENNETH:
How's your wife?

31:59.934 --> 32:02.231
MARCO:
Don't talk about her.

32:02.298 --> 32:04.533
KENNETH:
I had sex with her.

32:04.601 --> 32:06.836
Did you know that?

32:06.903 --> 32:08.838
MARCO:
You're lying.

32:08.905 --> 32:11.506
KENNETH: What surprised me
was the vigor.

32:11.574 --> 32:13.542
I mean, after that first kiss,

32:13.610 --> 32:17.438
she really...
threw herself into it.

32:21.442 --> 32:23.386
MARCO:
Where am I driving?

32:23.942 --> 32:25.988
KENNETH:
It's okay that she survived.

32:26.056 --> 32:28.357
I mean, it-it wasn't her fault.

32:28.424 --> 32:30.325
MARCO:
It's not Gus's fault either.

32:30.393 --> 32:32.341
KENNETH:
No, but he's your son.

32:33.015 --> 32:34.988
Like Caleb was mine.

32:37.300 --> 32:39.168
MARCO:
Where am I going, David?

32:39.236 --> 32:40.870
KENNETH:
Franklin Mountain Park.

32:40.937 --> 32:43.338
Did you do it at my house?

32:47.610 --> 32:49.178
MARCO:
Yes.

32:49.246 --> 32:52.226
KENNETH:
In my bed with my wife?

32:53.383 --> 32:55.143
What was your plan?

32:55.214 --> 32:56.695
MARCO:
I didn't have one.

32:56.730 --> 32:58.788
KENNETH: Did you think it was okay
as long as I didn't find out?

32:58.855 --> 33:00.122
MARCO:
No.

33:00.190 --> 33:02.124
KENNETH: Did you even think
about telling me?

33:02.192 --> 33:03.125
MARCO:
No.

33:03.193 --> 33:05.928
KENNETH: No, you just wanted
what you wanted.

33:06.901 --> 33:08.830
Who cares who it hurts?

33:11.082 --> 33:12.415
MARCO:
I'm getting to the park.

33:12.451 --> 33:14.890
KENNETH:
Lot J, near the quarry.

33:22.045 --> 33:23.749
WADE:
Hey, where's Marco?

33:24.384 --> 33:27.049
SONYA: I don't know.
He got a call and left.

33:27.117 --> 33:29.518
WADE:
Got a call from who?

33:33.623 --> 33:35.991
(Sonya groaning)

33:41.998 --> 33:43.616
KITTY:
You don't look good.

33:44.901 --> 33:47.269
SONYA:
Oh, it's-it's nothing.

33:47.337 --> 33:49.753
KITTY: Okay, come on.
Sit down.

33:49.973 --> 33:51.948
Sit.

33:54.010 --> 33:56.411
You need to eat.

34:03.653 --> 34:05.587
- SONYA: I don't like bananas.
- KITTY: That doesn't matter.

34:05.655 --> 34:07.923
You supposed to be on
an operating table right now.

34:07.991 --> 34:08.958
And I understand
why you're not,

34:09.025 --> 34:11.074
but you will be of no help
to Marco and his boy

34:11.110 --> 34:14.529
if you faint or get sick
or get hurt even worse.

34:15.763 --> 34:18.000
- SONYA: I need to keep looking.
- KITTY: I know.

34:18.168 --> 34:20.335
SONYA:
I know we're missing something.

34:21.085 --> 34:22.828
It's in those documents.
I know it.

34:22.864 --> 34:24.309
KITTY:
Okay.

34:24.351 --> 34:27.462
Just drink that.
And then back at it.

34:44.159 --> 34:45.926
KENNETH:
Well, hello there...

34:46.329 --> 34:47.862
old friend.

34:47.931 --> 34:50.498
Stop.

34:50.565 --> 34:53.085
MARCO:
Where is he?

34:58.074 --> 35:00.475
(Grunting)

35:07.217 --> 35:09.675
KENNETH: Strange feeling
for a cop, isn't it?

35:11.121 --> 35:13.555
To be powerless?

35:15.992 --> 35:18.001
MARCO:
Daniel Frye's?

35:19.062 --> 35:21.997
KENNETH: That's some amazing
detective work.

35:22.065 --> 35:24.466
MARCO:
Did you kill him, too?

35:26.102 --> 35:28.337
KENNETH: Have you thought
about me much?

35:28.405 --> 35:30.439
Since my...

35:30.506 --> 35:33.242
suicide?

35:33.310 --> 35:34.676
MARCO:
Not much.

35:34.744 --> 35:36.912
KENNETH: You knew
I was crumbling, right?

35:36.980 --> 35:39.915
After she died.

35:39.983 --> 35:43.585
A shrink had me hooked on pills.
The FBI fired me.

35:43.653 --> 35:46.055
MARCO:
I heard.

35:46.122 --> 35:49.224
KENNETH:
But not one phone call.

35:49.292 --> 35:53.028
MARCO: We were...
out of touch.

35:53.096 --> 35:55.424
KENNETH:
Funny how that happens.

35:55.865 --> 35:56.932
Get in the car.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.038
MARCO:
She chose me, David.

35:59.669 --> 36:01.770
All of this
because she chose me?

36:01.838 --> 36:03.105
KENNETH:
Yes.

36:03.173 --> 36:06.608
MARCO: You killed all these people
because your wife left you?

36:06.676 --> 36:08.310
KENNETH:
She was taken from me.

36:08.378 --> 36:11.613
MARCO: You're not the first person
to lose everything.

36:11.681 --> 36:14.083
Over there it happens every day!

36:14.150 --> 36:17.386
People have their lives
ripped away from them.

36:17.454 --> 36:19.855
It doesn't make them killers.

36:22.859 --> 36:25.276
KENNETH:
Maybe I'm special.

36:26.396 --> 36:29.147
MARCO:
You... you're not.

36:30.355 --> 36:32.388
KENNETH:
Get rid of you phone.

36:40.710 --> 36:42.811
You have a gun?

36:42.879 --> 36:44.079
(Marco sighs)

36:44.147 --> 36:45.080
MARCO:
Yes.

36:45.148 --> 36:46.448
KENNETH:
Good.

36:46.516 --> 36:48.783
I'll drive.

36:48.851 --> 36:51.186
(Car door closes)

37:15.245 --> 37:19.542
(Muffled yelling)
