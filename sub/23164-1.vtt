01:04.096 --> 01:09.106
I think you should consider
that if you leave like this,

01:10.203 --> 01:13.309
you'll never know the truth
of who Robin Masters is.

01:23.584 --> 01:29.330
If you would indulge me
in one more story,

01:32.561 --> 01:35.734
I think perhaps
you would find this useful.

01:43.806 --> 01:48.014
"After five days, the medical
unit had given up hope,

01:48.745 --> 01:51.684
"and a runner was sent
for Father Kirkpatrick.

01:52.249 --> 01:54.687
"The runner had only been
gone a scant 10 minutes"

01:54.752 --> 01:57.858
"when the most
miraculous event occurred."

01:59.324 --> 02:03.599
"Private Channing, whom
everyone had given up for dead,"

02:03.662 --> 02:06.434
"opened his eyes, looked around"

02:07.198 --> 02:09.402
"and asked
for a pint of Stout."

02:44.773 --> 02:46.543
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Glad to help out.

02:46.609 --> 02:48.346
Let me know if there's a
change in his condition.

02:48.411 --> 02:49.914
Yes. Thanks.

02:52.750 --> 02:54.152
Mrs. Magnum?

02:54.284 --> 02:55.754
It's Peterson.

02:55.819 --> 02:57.222
Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

02:57.288 --> 02:59.458
I'm Father Timothy.
I'll take you to your son.

02:59.523 --> 03:00.524
Thank you.

03:23.916 --> 03:25.151
Katherine.

03:27.754 --> 03:30.693
You must be Jonathan. I...

03:30.758 --> 03:31.960
I know.

03:35.162 --> 03:36.365
Tom.

03:36.564 --> 03:39.436
Naturally, I have no way
of knowing for certain,

03:40.935 --> 03:42.337
but I believe he can hear us.

03:51.847 --> 03:55.988
I can't believe how long it takes to get
from my part of the world to yours.

03:57.487 --> 04:01.394
You'd think someone would have
figured out a faster way by now.

04:04.595 --> 04:06.732
No wonder you never come home.

04:11.770 --> 04:13.405
Wouldn't you know,

04:14.573 --> 04:16.176
I was leaving for the airport

04:16.241 --> 04:18.511
and Frank had
a terrible asthma attack.

04:18.844 --> 04:21.349
They seem to be
getting worse every year.

04:21.413 --> 04:23.584
He was really incapacitated.

04:26.786 --> 04:29.291
Oh, why am I
telling you all of this?

04:29.355 --> 04:33.564
The last thing you want to hear about
is your stepfather's problems.

04:34.762 --> 04:37.534
Anyway, he's fine.
He's gonna be just fine.

04:41.836 --> 04:43.038
Oh, Thomas,

04:44.071 --> 04:47.244
this better not be one of
your stupid practical jokes,

04:52.447 --> 04:56.455
"A woman in Holland was
in a coma for eight weeks."

04:56.519 --> 04:59.658
"They had completely lost hope
when one day her nurse came in"

04:59.723 --> 05:02.495
"and found her up, dressed
and ready to go home."

05:02.559 --> 05:03.594
Carol.

05:03.660 --> 05:06.432
She said that she had been
abducted by alien beings

05:06.496 --> 05:07.932
and taken to another planet.

05:07.998 --> 05:09.300
Right.

05:09.366 --> 05:10.736
Okay, don't believe me,

05:10.802 --> 05:13.273
but her doctors couldn't find
one thing wrong with her.

05:13.338 --> 05:15.642
Except that sometimes she
speaks in this foreign tongue,

05:15.707 --> 05:17.277
and nobody's
been able to place it.

05:17.342 --> 05:19.145
I suppose there is
a remote possibility.

05:19.210 --> 05:20.947
Stop it! Just stop it!

05:21.012 --> 05:23.517
What do you read this kind
of garbage for, anyway?

05:23.582 --> 05:24.583
Rick.

05:30.322 --> 05:33.395
Maybe I was just looking
for a little hope.

05:33.993 --> 05:35.763
Well, there's no hope.

05:35.829 --> 05:37.967
He's gonna die, and all of you
better get it through your head.

05:38.031 --> 05:40.335
You're just sitting around
here kidding yourselves.

05:41.434 --> 05:44.274
I don't know what the hell
good it's gonna do, anyway.

05:47.074 --> 05:48.709
I'll go talk to him.

05:51.913 --> 05:53.248
I don't know
what we haven't thought of.

05:53.315 --> 05:56.487
There's gotta be
something we can do.

05:56.551 --> 05:59.658
The doctors are doing
everything humanly possible.

05:59.722 --> 06:01.659
There's nothing else we can do.

06:01.724 --> 06:03.259
Unless...

06:08.131 --> 06:10.736
Unless we've overlooked
the obvious.

06:12.001 --> 06:17.145
Thomas, I've always tried real
hard never to tell you what to do.

06:17.207 --> 06:19.344
But if you want my opinion,

06:20.945 --> 06:23.417
you ought to wake up
and get out of this place.

06:23.481 --> 06:25.384
You've been here long enough.

06:25.817 --> 06:28.389
It's time to go home.

06:31.991 --> 06:33.260
Magnum!

06:34.226 --> 06:37.699
I demand you come
back immediately!

06:37.763 --> 06:39.166
Magnum!

06:57.385 --> 06:59.388
My God, what have I done?

07:11.901 --> 07:14.973
Time has little to do with
infinity and jelly donuts.

07:35.895 --> 07:37.965
With this ring I thee wed.

08:55.816 --> 08:58.555
If you're not dead, how come
nobody can see you or hear you?

08:58.619 --> 09:00.589
If I am dead, how come
I don't feel like it?

09:00.654 --> 09:02.724
How come I feel like
staying and fighting this?

09:02.790 --> 09:04.126
It's all a part of the process.

09:04.191 --> 09:06.395
No. There's something else.

09:12.601 --> 09:15.039
Hey, you can't
just walk away from this.

09:19.509 --> 09:20.811
It's all part of the process.

09:20.877 --> 09:22.680
No. There's something else.

10:00.887 --> 10:02.223
Hit the brakes!

10:09.564 --> 10:11.334
No. There's something else.

10:37.661 --> 10:38.929
He's not responding.

10:41.398 --> 10:43.568
That's it. You can turn
off the equipment.

10:49.574 --> 10:52.179
I'm sorry. We did
everything we could.

10:52.244 --> 10:53.981
Record the time of death.

10:54.180 --> 10:55.315
11:05.

11:07.861 --> 11:09.331
A pint of Stout.

11:13.201 --> 11:15.138
I'd like a pint of Stout.

11:36.292 --> 11:38.864
What took you so long, sport?

12:49.456 --> 12:51.126
It happens with stroke patients.

12:51.191 --> 12:53.829
The loss of motor skills
and the loss of memory.

12:54.328 --> 12:57.969
But all of the tests that the doctors
have run on him have come back negative.

12:58.167 --> 13:00.404
I can't give you any medical
reason for the fact

13:00.468 --> 13:04.175
that he hasn't spoken since he
asked for that pint of Stout.

13:04.540 --> 13:08.848
I thought transferring him to a
VA hospital might jar something.

13:09.913 --> 13:12.050
But it's been two weeks.

13:12.115 --> 13:13.751
Well, he's been
through a severe trauma.

13:13.817 --> 13:15.787
Not only the shooting,
but the coma.

13:16.686 --> 13:20.093
Perhaps it's still
a residual shock effect.

13:20.157 --> 13:23.764
Is it possible he simply
doesn't remember how?

13:23.861 --> 13:26.700
His physical condition is
improving dramatically.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.734
I've never seen
such a rapid recovery.

13:28.799 --> 13:30.737
The body, at least,
wants to mend.

13:33.672 --> 13:37.679
They've rescheduled Mrs.
Hutchinson's surgery. Excuse me.

13:37.743 --> 13:40.683
Thank you for taking time out to go
over the doctors' reports with us.

13:40.747 --> 13:42.517
Anything I can do...

13:46.853 --> 13:50.160
I think we should reconsider
telling him what happened.

13:50.224 --> 13:51.627
I mean about Michelle.

13:51.692 --> 13:54.063
Michelle and the
little girl are gone.

13:54.128 --> 13:55.264
They're safe.

13:55.329 --> 13:58.969
All of his doctors agree it would be
very risky to give him that information.

13:59.034 --> 14:03.275
He may not be able to handle so
great a loss at this point in time.

14:03.438 --> 14:05.107
Yo, heads up!

14:05.174 --> 14:07.778
Hey, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

14:07.842 --> 14:10.915
Playing basketball.
Sorry to startle you.

14:12.048 --> 14:14.753
Hey, I've been seeing you around.
My name is Nick.

14:15.218 --> 14:16.753
When you feel up to it,
why don't you wander on down

14:16.819 --> 14:17.922
to the physical therapy
department?

14:17.988 --> 14:20.192
I got some new equipment in.
We could try it out.

14:20.257 --> 14:21.627
We'll let you know, okay?

14:21.692 --> 14:22.794
Sometimes you get
the body moving,

14:22.859 --> 14:25.063
it kind of shakes loose everything
else that's locked up inside.

14:25.128 --> 14:28.301
Hey, pal, there ain't nothing
locked up, all right?

14:28.365 --> 14:29.567
You want your friend
to talk again,

14:29.633 --> 14:31.403
don't go around pretending
like there's no problem.

14:31.468 --> 14:33.004
Hey, come on, Coach!

14:33.071 --> 14:35.543
I'll see you.
All right, play ball!

14:36.608 --> 14:38.645
Yo, come on, set it up,
set it up, come on!

14:38.710 --> 14:40.146
Follow through,
come on underneath!

14:40.212 --> 14:43.352
Abromowitz! Oh, you're
making me crazy, man!

14:43.415 --> 14:45.084
Back up, set up, set up.

14:45.751 --> 14:47.087
Tom.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.691
Tom, we're back.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.661
Did you miss me?

14:54.195 --> 14:58.036
Well, of course you did.
Why did I even ask?

15:01.035 --> 15:02.605
Wanna go for a walk?

15:02.670 --> 15:04.807
You're making things very difficult.
I don't care.

15:04.872 --> 15:07.744
Well, you just have a certain amount
of time to do this, you know.

15:07.809 --> 15:11.081
Just give me enough time to get
through to somebody, that's all.

15:11.146 --> 15:13.116
How much time do you need?

15:13.181 --> 15:15.886
Time has little to do with
infinity and jelly donuts.

15:32.403 --> 15:33.938
Let's go take that walk.

15:42.180 --> 15:44.117
What did he say?

15:45.184 --> 15:47.154
Infinity and jelly donuts, pal.

15:47.219 --> 15:49.423
He probably didn't have
anything to say, that's all.

15:50.122 --> 15:52.092
He's gonna be all right. Yes.

15:53.426 --> 15:55.830
I talked with Billy
on the phone this morning.

15:55.895 --> 15:57.131
He's got this idea

15:57.197 --> 16:00.002
that you're going to coach his
little league team this year.

16:00.067 --> 16:03.274
Well, Frank...
He offered to help out,

16:03.337 --> 16:05.774
but with his
asthma attacks, I...

16:05.839 --> 16:07.910
Well, I don't think
it's possible.

16:08.242 --> 16:09.712
I can't go home, Mom.

16:11.946 --> 16:13.716
Just for a little while.

16:15.817 --> 16:17.554
I can't. Well, not yet.

16:20.956 --> 16:22.326
There's something.

16:22.392 --> 16:23.827
Thomas!

16:26.695 --> 16:28.065
What is it?

16:30.166 --> 16:34.742
I'm not sure. There's
something I have to do,

16:36.207 --> 16:37.710
but I just can't quite...

16:39.543 --> 16:43.684
Tom, I can understand you're
having strange kinds of,

16:43.948 --> 16:45.751
I don't know,
premonitions, feelings.

16:45.816 --> 16:49.056
Whatever they are, I'm sure
it's perfectly natural.

16:49.121 --> 16:51.659
No, it's... After what
you've been through.

16:53.392 --> 16:55.829
No, it's more than that, Mom.

16:55.895 --> 16:58.165
It isn't more than that.

17:03.870 --> 17:05.039
Okay.

17:09.041 --> 17:10.277
All right.

17:14.714 --> 17:16.920
I know this is gonna
sound strange.

17:17.986 --> 17:21.992
But if you could just try to...

17:23.092 --> 17:26.031
Okay, I was here

17:26.095 --> 17:27.698
when I was gone.

17:28.931 --> 17:35.044
No. I know I was in the hospital
room, in ICU, in that bed,

17:35.771 --> 17:37.441
but I was also here.

17:37.506 --> 17:38.642
Tom.

17:40.444 --> 17:41.813
Kind of around.

17:42.712 --> 17:44.282
No, I really was.

17:46.583 --> 17:48.721
Ask the dogs. They saw me.

17:48.786 --> 17:51.691
All right, I know
you can't ask the dogs.

17:51.756 --> 17:54.896
They couldn't tell you.
But they would if they could.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.763
Now the point is,

17:56.829 --> 17:58.164
I was here,

17:58.931 --> 18:02.471
and I remember some of it

18:04.070 --> 18:05.605
and that's why

18:06.472 --> 18:08.743
I know there's something
I have to do.

18:12.645 --> 18:13.880
But I...

18:15.516 --> 18:17.519
I can't remember everything.

18:20.287 --> 18:24.129
I just get the feeling that
Michelle is somehow in danger,

18:25.493 --> 18:27.396
and I need to help her.

18:30.031 --> 18:32.436
Tom, Michelle... Hey, Thomas!

18:32.501 --> 18:36.108
Boy, I'm glad I caught you.
I got all the way to the car.

18:36.172 --> 18:38.544
I realized I forgot
to give you this.

18:38.608 --> 18:40.311
Al Kaline, his rookie year.

18:40.510 --> 18:42.079
I bumped into a friend
of mine this morning

18:42.145 --> 18:43.680
who was kind of
down and out on his luck.

18:43.746 --> 18:46.652
He wanted to sell it, so I bought it,
figuring that you'd like to have it.

18:46.783 --> 18:48.252
You were here all morning.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.889
Oh, I almost forgot to tell you.

18:50.988 --> 18:52.524
There's a message
at the nurses' station.

18:52.589 --> 18:56.063
Something about Frank being a lot
better since his attack this morning.

18:56.127 --> 18:57.262
Thank you.

18:57.328 --> 18:58.329
Thomas,

18:59.130 --> 19:00.600
look at the back.
The stats and everything.

19:00.665 --> 19:01.900
I mean, it's in mint condition.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.937
It's very rare
for a card that old.

19:04.303 --> 19:05.672
Thanks, Rick.

19:08.107 --> 19:10.645
Oh, by the way, you're welcome.

19:10.709 --> 19:11.744
For what?

19:11.810 --> 19:15.050
For the birth certificate and the
documents that got you out of jail.

19:15.115 --> 19:18.522
Oh, I never got a chance to thank you.
Yes, you did.

19:21.821 --> 19:25.094
You were there
and you were here.

19:25.159 --> 19:27.764
Right. I guess that's
the best way to put it.

19:28.629 --> 19:30.064
At the same time?

19:30.131 --> 19:31.133
Right.

19:32.534 --> 19:33.870
You don't believe me.

19:33.936 --> 19:37.610
No, I wouldn't say exactly that
I don't believe you. I just...

19:37.673 --> 19:40.144
All right. All right. You

19:40.842 --> 19:44.082
and T.C. and Agatha
and Higgins and...

19:44.147 --> 19:46.886
Stop that. And Tanaka and Ibold

19:47.551 --> 19:49.922
were all at the estate,
talking about me,

19:49.986 --> 19:52.624
as if I was already dead, by the way,
which I didn't especially appreciate...

19:52.689 --> 19:54.459
We were in shock. Aha!

19:55.492 --> 19:57.697
"Aha" what? Aha, admit it.

19:57.761 --> 20:01.168
I mean, admit that I was right
about you all being there.

20:01.232 --> 20:03.002
Well, of course
we were all there.

20:03.068 --> 20:07.142
And how could I have known
that if I wasn't there?

20:08.773 --> 20:10.977
Because Higgins
told you, Thomas.

20:11.042 --> 20:13.781
When you were in your coma
he told you everything.

20:22.456 --> 20:27.667
Are you saying that I heard all
of that from the hospital?

20:28.095 --> 20:29.765
And then you imagined it.

20:29.997 --> 20:32.068
You have a very
vivid imagination.

20:32.934 --> 20:35.271
Listen, Thomas,

20:35.336 --> 20:36.872
I'm just happy
that you're alive,

20:36.938 --> 20:39.175
and whatever happened or
whatever you think happened,

20:39.241 --> 20:40.843
it's all over
and done with anyway.

20:40.908 --> 20:41.977
Something happened.

20:42.044 --> 20:43.646
I'm talking about the shooting.
Something happened.

20:43.711 --> 20:45.047
Something you don't
wanna tell me about.

20:45.114 --> 20:46.917
Oh, Thomas... What is it?

20:46.982 --> 20:51.224
Hey, Thomas, I'm gonna put an end to
that theory of yours once and for all.

20:53.289 --> 20:54.591
Come on.

20:57.428 --> 21:00.133
Hey, Magnum, great to see you!

21:05.169 --> 21:06.337
Mac?

21:06.404 --> 21:10.346
No. Jim Boning.
He just looks like Mac.

21:10.409 --> 21:11.878
This is Jim Boning? Yeah.

21:11.943 --> 21:14.614
How you doing? The guy that Thomas
thinks looks like MacReynolds?

21:14.680 --> 21:16.650
Yeah. You see, you must've
had dealings with Mac.

21:16.716 --> 21:19.388
I mean, with Jim and when
you went into the coma...

21:19.452 --> 21:20.620
I don't think he looks like Mac.

21:20.686 --> 21:23.458
What are you talking about? He looks
exactly like Mac, except for the mustache.

21:23.523 --> 21:24.923
Anyway, when you went
into the coma,

21:24.924 --> 21:26.661
you thought you were having
a conversation with Mac,

21:26.727 --> 21:28.597
but you couldn't have been
because Mac is dead.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.298
No, it isn't just the mustache,

21:30.364 --> 21:32.334
it's the eyes and the hair
and the smile.

21:32.399 --> 21:35.399
Look, I was kind of in the middle of a
very important business meeting, so...

21:35.436 --> 21:37.239
Yeah, jacks are better to open.

21:37.304 --> 21:38.540
So as much as I'm enjoying...

21:41.609 --> 21:44.147
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

21:45.346 --> 21:47.451
Well, do you believe me now?

21:54.056 --> 21:56.160
Well, it was worth a try.

22:47.582 --> 22:50.387
Hello, Tina Calvin,
this is Theodore Calvin.

22:51.153 --> 22:52.723
Yeah, I know it's late.

22:54.022 --> 22:56.727
I had three charters today,

22:56.792 --> 22:59.531
a whole week's worth of
paperwork waiting for me.

23:01.998 --> 23:03.367
How are the kids?

23:04.735 --> 23:07.206
I just wanted to say
good night to them.

23:08.372 --> 23:10.576
No, I haven't talked
to Thomas today.

23:10.841 --> 23:12.946
I've been busy. I told you...

23:15.312 --> 23:17.115
Yeah, okay.

23:18.249 --> 23:19.417
Good night.

23:31.330 --> 23:34.537
Thomas Magnum, please.
Yeah, I'll hold. Thank you.

24:15.679 --> 24:18.952
Now, I tag you
for a baseball fan.

24:19.016 --> 24:20.953
J more than basketball
am I right?

24:25.923 --> 24:27.226
I knew it.

24:27.959 --> 24:31.165
And I knew you'd show up here today.
Sooner or later, anyway.

24:31.897 --> 24:35.571
You know, I have this funny
ability to read you guys.

24:35.635 --> 24:36.971
"Us guys"?

24:37.036 --> 24:40.409
Now, you, for instance, are some
serious stubborn, but curious.

24:41.508 --> 24:44.347
Probably worked real well for you
in the war, but on the outside...

24:44.411 --> 24:46.448
You aren't going
to talk about the war.

24:46.513 --> 24:48.116
Are you one of those guys
who still can't talk about it?

24:48.182 --> 24:49.584
I can talk about it just fine.

24:49.651 --> 24:51.521
I'm just not gonna talk
about it with you.

24:51.586 --> 24:53.389
Did you ever try
these free weights?

24:53.455 --> 24:54.990
Some friends of mine
were dying over there

24:55.055 --> 24:57.093
when you were playing
high school basketball,

24:57.158 --> 24:59.495
or celebrating the fact
you had a high lottery number.

24:59.561 --> 25:01.666
You know, I really think you're
gonna get to whatever's bugging you

25:01.730 --> 25:04.902
with these free weights
faster than on that bicycle.

25:07.403 --> 25:08.605
Stubborn.

25:10.005 --> 25:11.508
But curious.

25:14.311 --> 25:15.880
You're right.

25:17.647 --> 25:20.085
I didn't get to Vietnam
until it was over.

25:20.417 --> 25:24.325
You know, the Chinese believe we lock
unpleasant memories in various muscles.

25:27.759 --> 25:29.094
What is it?

25:31.597 --> 25:33.767
Come on, you saw something.

25:36.034 --> 25:39.306
Yeah. I'm real close.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.211
Hey, Thomas, I've been
looking all over for you.

25:44.277 --> 25:46.781
Father Timothy here said
you might be over here.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.081
I thought we were
gonna watch old movies.

25:48.148 --> 25:50.753
I picked up Stalag 17,
A Thousand Clowns...

25:50.818 --> 25:53.088
What were you doing in Vietnam?

25:53.987 --> 25:55.857
I was at the Club Med.

25:56.490 --> 25:58.493
Actually, I was in
the Merchant Marine.

25:58.559 --> 26:01.264
I wouldn't mind seeing
Stalag 17 again myself.

26:01.328 --> 26:03.700
Unfortunately, I have a
noon service in the chapel,

26:03.765 --> 26:05.502
which I wanted to make
sure you knew about.

26:05.567 --> 26:07.537
Yeah, well, we might
be a little tied up, Father.

26:07.636 --> 26:10.509
The Magnificent Seven.
So, what do you think?

26:11.106 --> 26:13.878
There were three men
in the warehouse.

26:14.410 --> 26:16.714
Thomas, you're not gonna
start on that again.

26:16.780 --> 26:17.781
On what?

26:18.381 --> 26:21.253
Thomas has this idea
that when he was unconscious

26:21.318 --> 26:24.190
that he was floating around, and
he was talking to all of us.

26:24.254 --> 26:26.625
That's a very
interesting theory.

26:26.690 --> 26:28.293
Well, that's just
what it is, Father.

26:28.358 --> 26:29.994
Oh, I don't know.

26:30.394 --> 26:31.864
What did you see?

26:32.664 --> 26:35.169
Three men in the warehouse.

26:35.233 --> 26:37.470
Two of them went over the cliff.
That leaves a third man.

26:37.535 --> 26:40.975
No, it doesn't. There was
another body in the warehouse.

26:41.039 --> 26:43.310
Lieutenant Tanaka said
you must have shot him.

26:58.726 --> 27:00.228
You are close.

27:10.972 --> 27:13.243
There's something I missed.

27:13.308 --> 27:15.980
All right, Thomas, I'm gonna tell
you something for your own good.

27:16.044 --> 27:18.682
We all agreed not to tell you, because
we figured you couldn't handle it,

27:18.748 --> 27:20.050
but I'm gonna tell you anyway,

27:20.115 --> 27:23.589
just so you can take all of this business
and put it behind you, where it belongs.

27:23.653 --> 27:25.289
Michelle... l know.

27:28.592 --> 27:30.094
She was here.

27:30.960 --> 27:31.961
What?

27:35.099 --> 27:38.171
Your cousin, Michelle.
Yeah, I know all about it.

27:38.969 --> 27:40.171
You know she was here?

27:40.237 --> 27:41.506
I saw her.

27:41.740 --> 27:42.741
Thomas.

27:42.807 --> 27:46.014
After the shooting, in the car.

27:46.077 --> 27:49.049
J when the guys went over
the cliff I was with her.

27:49.782 --> 27:51.919
But if the third guy was
killed in the warehouse...

27:51.983 --> 27:53.753
Which he was.

27:54.754 --> 27:55.857
Well, that means...

27:55.922 --> 27:58.560
That means that she's
out of danger, my cousin.

27:59.325 --> 28:00.327
No.

28:02.094 --> 28:05.167
It means there's a fourth
man still out there.

28:05.933 --> 28:08.805
Thomas, if you know where she is,
then why don't you warn her?

28:08.870 --> 28:09.938
Thomas!

28:14.242 --> 28:15.812
I don't know where she is.

28:18.580 --> 28:21.953
I knew she was here, but I
don't know where she went.

28:25.154 --> 28:27.893
Why should I know that?
She's your cousin.

28:28.692 --> 28:29.927
Hey, wait.

28:30.760 --> 28:32.897
I'm sorry I brought
Michelle up in front of them.

28:32.962 --> 28:35.434
Your Uncle Rudy still work
in the Merchant Marine?

28:35.498 --> 28:37.034
Yeah. Well, call him and ask him

28:37.100 --> 28:39.540
if Nick Patrelli ever went to the
Orient on one of their ships.

28:39.570 --> 28:41.139
Come on, Thomas, I admit
that I didn't I like the guy

28:41.205 --> 28:42.907
when I first met him either, but
you're chasing your own ghost.

28:42.974 --> 28:44.811
I happened to have an interesting
conversation with a nice lady

28:44.876 --> 28:45.944
in personnel this morning.

28:46.011 --> 28:48.215
It seems Nick Patrelli just happened
to volunteer his services here

28:48.279 --> 28:49.482
the day after I was admitted.

28:49.548 --> 28:51.952
So that makes him a mastermind in
a plot to kill you and Michelle?

28:52.017 --> 28:54.622
It makes him the most
likely candidate I've got.

28:54.686 --> 28:57.291
See what you can find
out for me, will you?

28:57.356 --> 28:58.759
Please?

29:07.835 --> 29:09.838
I'm telling you, you've been
avoiding this whole situation

29:09.903 --> 29:11.606
ever since Thomas
entered the VA Hospital.

29:11.672 --> 29:12.872
Hey, what do you want me to do?

29:12.873 --> 29:14.309
You think you're gonna
personally change anything

29:14.375 --> 29:16.245
by hanging around him
24 hours a day?

29:16.310 --> 29:18.615
I can try. That's a hell of a lot
more than you're willing to do.

29:18.680 --> 29:20.200
Rick... l come to you
for a little help,

29:20.215 --> 29:22.552
but suddenly you got charters to Maui,
you're going to the Big Island...

29:22.617 --> 29:25.389
Hey! What's gonna
happen if I'm gone?

29:25.453 --> 29:27.624
I mean, I've just gotten
to know my kids again.

29:27.690 --> 29:30.762
I mean, who's gonna take care
of them if I'm not around?

29:31.394 --> 29:34.466
I gotta make sure they're
gonna be okay before...

29:34.530 --> 29:35.799
, Look, T.C.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.670
we're all gonna die someday.

29:38.735 --> 29:40.905
I mean, I've been thinking
about it a lot, too,

29:40.971 --> 29:42.474
ever since this
happened to Thomas.

29:42.539 --> 29:46.480
But you don't have to think about
it every day of your life.

29:46.544 --> 29:49.616
Right now, Thomas is the
one who needs our help.

29:52.817 --> 29:54.453
All right. Forget it!

30:09.235 --> 30:10.403
The three guys
who were after you

30:10.470 --> 30:13.475
were pros with no particular
political leanings.

30:15.009 --> 30:16.645
So there's no motive.

30:17.445 --> 30:18.880
There's no reason.

30:19.814 --> 30:23.354
There's got to be a reason.

30:26.387 --> 30:27.456
Maggie?

30:28.590 --> 30:30.059
I'm sorry, Thomas.

30:31.460 --> 30:33.030
It's just that I...

30:34.496 --> 30:38.371
Well, I mean I can't believe that
we're actually sitting here talking.

30:40.269 --> 30:43.141
I almost gave you up for...
Me, too.

30:46.143 --> 30:48.281
Anyway, whoever hired these guys

30:48.345 --> 30:50.515
obviously knew that Michelle
was on her way here.

30:50.581 --> 30:53.153
Now, we haven't been able to
determine through Navy sources

30:53.217 --> 30:56.356
who that might have been, but I
have a friend over at CIA...

30:56.420 --> 30:57.790
Ron. Ron.

30:59.290 --> 31:01.027
How do you know about Ron?

31:01.994 --> 31:03.363
Well, I...

31:05.363 --> 31:07.033
You must have told me.

31:08.267 --> 31:11.840
Well, he's doing everything he can
to try and find an ID for us.

31:11.905 --> 31:12.945
I gave him the number here.

31:13.006 --> 31:15.845
How was dinner?
Oh, it was pretty terrible.

31:17.177 --> 31:18.413
Lucky guess.

31:21.581 --> 31:23.184
Commander Poole.

31:23.985 --> 31:26.423
Oh, hi, Rick.
Yes, he's right here.

31:27.287 --> 31:28.523
Rick, what do you got?

31:31.492 --> 31:34.264
The Merchant Marine
never heard of Nick Patrelli.

31:34.328 --> 31:36.733
Neither did the CIA.

31:36.798 --> 31:39.737
Ron... Right again, Magpie.

31:40.869 --> 31:42.272
Yeah, thanks, Rick. Goodbye.

31:43.206 --> 31:45.276
Ron Templeton, Thomas Magnum.

31:45.340 --> 31:47.812
His name is Quang Ki.

31:51.648 --> 31:53.151
Colonel Ki's brother?

31:55.653 --> 31:57.155
Thomas!

32:05.630 --> 32:07.132
Traitor!

32:10.535 --> 32:13.007
No. There's something else.

32:13.072 --> 32:14.073
Thomas.

32:16.576 --> 32:17.811
Thomas?

32:53.650 --> 32:56.187
He's trying to avenge
his brother's death.

33:29.206 --> 33:31.344
I haven't seen
him since this morning.

33:31.409 --> 33:33.449
It's funny you should be
looking for him too, though.

33:33.711 --> 33:35.414
Why are you looking for him?

33:35.780 --> 33:37.350
One of the guys wanted
to talk to him.

33:37.415 --> 33:39.553
Said he didn't show up
for noon service.

33:39.618 --> 33:42.490
I called the rectory. They said...
They never heard of him.

33:43.989 --> 33:45.324
Right.

33:45.390 --> 33:47.327
Why'd you lie about being
in the Merchant Marine?

33:48.795 --> 33:49.930
What is this?

33:51.764 --> 33:53.032
You checked up on me?

33:53.099 --> 33:56.739
I'm just wondering what you haven't
told us about Father Timothy.

33:56.804 --> 33:58.741
He said he had some
business to take care of.

33:58.806 --> 34:00.943
That he'd be back
in time for noon service.

34:01.007 --> 34:04.647
He wasn't. That's all I know
about the good priest.

34:05.847 --> 34:07.349
Excuse me.

34:07.414 --> 34:08.949
I got work to do.

34:13.788 --> 34:16.393
Thomas, you can't go
after Quang Ki.

34:16.458 --> 34:18.996
You don't understand, Maggie.
I killed his brother.

34:19.060 --> 34:21.231
As long as he's alive,
he won't stop at anything.

34:21.297 --> 34:22.632
I understand that!

34:22.697 --> 34:25.036
You think he's gonna avenge his
brother's death by killing Michelle?

34:25.101 --> 34:26.436
He thought he had her.

34:26.502 --> 34:29.542
Once Michelle was on the way to
Hawaii, he knew he could kill me.

34:29.606 --> 34:31.376
He just hadn't counted
on Michelle getting away.

34:31.440 --> 34:32.876
Or on you.

34:32.943 --> 34:35.315
Hey, you're a professional.
I appreciate that.

34:35.379 --> 34:38.251
Ron... Let me handle
this, Magpie.

34:38.315 --> 34:40.687
Let's face it. You've been
out of the field a while.

34:40.752 --> 34:44.025
You should leave it to
younger guys to find Quang.

34:46.625 --> 34:47.760
Where did this come from?

34:47.826 --> 34:50.797
I don't know.
Rick? T.C.? Your mom?

34:50.862 --> 34:52.233
You didn't bring it?

34:52.297 --> 34:54.601
Thomas. This is just
what I was telling you.

34:54.667 --> 34:57.874
First you think that the physical
therapy coach is out to get you,

34:57.937 --> 35:00.342
and now you think there's something
sinister about the photograph.

35:00.407 --> 35:02.177
Ron, he didn't make all this up.

35:02.242 --> 35:04.112
All right, let's not even
look at the fact

35:04.177 --> 35:06.715
that your body's just been
through a tremendous trauma.

35:06.781 --> 35:08.751
Suppose you were
in the peak of health.

35:08.816 --> 35:11.336
You have an emotional investment
here that could get in your way.

35:11.385 --> 35:13.555
I don't think that's
any of your business.

35:13.621 --> 35:16.360
Thomas, I know you
want to help Michelle,

35:16.424 --> 35:20.031
but maybe the best way to do that
right now is to just stay out of it.

35:20.094 --> 35:22.232
Just give me 24 hours.

35:22.297 --> 35:23.599
Okay.

35:24.700 --> 35:26.370
Really, Thomas.

35:27.837 --> 35:30.074
Now you listen to me,
frank Peterson.

35:30.138 --> 35:33.278
I know you're having problems
with these asthma attacks,

35:34.243 --> 35:36.413
but my son is in real trouble,

35:36.479 --> 35:38.951
and I'm not leaving
till I know he's okay.

35:39.016 --> 35:42.690
And you'll do just fine
without me till I get there.

35:42.753 --> 35:45.458
And I love you, too. All right.

35:47.057 --> 35:48.560
I can't find T.C. anywhere.

35:49.394 --> 35:51.063
Perhaps it's just
as well he's busy.

35:51.129 --> 35:52.564
There's nothing he can do.

35:52.630 --> 35:55.602
Lieutenant Commander Poole has
assured me they'll find Quang Ki.

35:55.668 --> 35:57.203
And you believe that?

35:58.136 --> 35:59.137
Me either.

36:01.975 --> 36:03.477
What'll we do?

36:04.643 --> 36:07.181
Well, it started
in Little Saigon.

36:23.832 --> 36:25.067
Michelle!

36:29.371 --> 36:30.606
Thomas!

36:42.552 --> 36:43.654
Sorry.

36:43.720 --> 36:45.624
I didn't mean to startle you.

36:45.689 --> 36:47.191
What do you want, Patrelli?

36:50.161 --> 36:55.070
I wanted to tell you
that you're wrong.

36:56.501 --> 36:59.440
I never played basketball
in high school,

36:59.504 --> 37:01.774
and I never celebrated
over my lottery number.

37:01.840 --> 37:03.210
Forget it.

37:04.010 --> 37:05.011
Really.

37:11.184 --> 37:13.923
Oh. Merchant Marine.

37:13.987 --> 37:16.726
It usually gives me a little
credibility with the guys I work with.

37:17.190 --> 37:18.760
I never saw any harm in it.

37:18.826 --> 37:20.763
What did you say he said to you?

37:20.828 --> 37:22.198
Father Timothy?

37:23.163 --> 37:27.472
He said he had some...
What was it?

37:27.535 --> 37:29.605
Unfinished business
to take care of.

37:36.645 --> 37:39.384
If he wanted me here,
he'd leave me an invitation.

37:39.448 --> 37:40.984
I beg your pardon?

37:41.450 --> 37:42.953
Are you gonna get that?

37:44.253 --> 37:45.756
Sorry, Maggie.

37:55.800 --> 37:56.801
Yep?

37:58.302 --> 37:59.303
Nope.

38:00.538 --> 38:01.673
He just left.

38:01.739 --> 38:03.844
Left? Left for where?

38:59.037 --> 39:00.606
Thomas!

43:09.512 --> 43:10.513
Thomas!

43:21.358 --> 43:23.195
There's another way, man.

44:41.880 --> 44:43.683
I love you, Michelle.

44:46.485 --> 44:48.422
More than anyone
I've ever known.

44:53.193 --> 44:54.929
And I'm letting you go.

45:16.919 --> 45:20.025
Well, see you in
another 40 or 50 years.
