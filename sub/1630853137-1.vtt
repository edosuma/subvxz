03:24.333 --> 03:26.666
Morning, Gus, my little one-finned wonder.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.708
Hello, Mom. It's me. Just checkin' in.

03:30.791 --> 03:34.625
I got your postcard,
putting it up on Gus' tank now.

03:34.708 --> 03:37.541
Yeah, it's very nice.
He is fuming, though.

03:37.625 --> 03:40.791
Keeps asking why
I don't take him anywhere nice.

03:40.875 --> 03:42.166
Maybe one day, right?

03:42.250 --> 03:45.416
He'd love to get out there,
but it's a bit hard with one fin, innit?

03:45.500 --> 03:48.416
Anyway, Mom,
all's well here. Not too bad.

03:48.500 --> 03:51.750
Still wake up every morning
still feeling like I got hit by a bus.

03:52.375 --> 03:53.583
And if you...

03:54.458 --> 03:57.583
Hey, mate, still selling
the old brushes and brooms, right?

03:58.250 --> 04:01.958
Right in front of my entrance. It's...
Got no problem with it. Cheers.

04:02.625 --> 04:04.166
Anyway, sorry I missed you, Mom.

04:04.250 --> 04:06.875
I'll try you again tomorrow.
Laters, gators.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.083
Oh, bloody hell. Wait!

04:12.916 --> 04:14.083
Bollocks.

04:27.166 --> 04:28.166
Cheers.

04:36.375 --> 04:37.583
Hmm.

04:39.291 --> 04:40.750
Will you look at that?

04:41.541 --> 04:42.708
Looks like someone mistook

04:42.791 --> 04:44.833
the Great Pyramid of Giza
for a rubbish dump.

04:45.208 --> 04:47.083
It's not like there's anything in there.

04:47.666 --> 04:49.375
Yeah. Maybe not.

04:50.125 --> 04:52.125
But in there

04:53.416 --> 04:54.916
is something wicked.

04:55.750 --> 04:59.916
Check it out. They'd take
this big metal hook, right?

05:00.000 --> 05:03.125
And they go up the old nozzle and...

05:03.208 --> 05:05.916
All the organs would come out.
Except for the heart.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.166
How come?

05:07.250 --> 05:09.041
Because they believed
you needed your heart

05:09.125 --> 05:10.916
to be judged in the Underworld

05:11.000 --> 05:15.125
and only the worthiest would be allowed
to pass through the Field of Reeds.

05:15.208 --> 05:18.833
And did it suck for you?
Getting rejected from the Field of Reeds?

05:18.916 --> 05:21.791
That doesn't make sense
'cause I'm not dead, am I?

05:21.875 --> 05:23.041
-Stevie.
-Am I...

05:23.125 --> 05:27.000
-That better not be you again.
-Sorry, Donna. Yeah, sorry. Got it.

05:28.166 --> 05:29.250
There we go.

05:29.833 --> 05:32.166
Don't know how many times
I have to tell you this.

05:32.250 --> 05:34.375
You're not the bloody tour guide, Stevie.

05:34.458 --> 05:37.708
Steven, actually. I am... Steven.

05:37.791 --> 05:38.833
No, you're bloody useless

05:38.916 --> 05:41.416
unless you're actually doing
what you're paid to do,

05:41.500 --> 05:44.500
which is to sell these to children.

05:45.500 --> 05:46.500
Got it.

05:52.041 --> 05:53.041
Hello.

05:53.208 --> 05:55.833
-Hello.
-How's the sugar trade going?

05:55.916 --> 05:58.250
I don't know what this
has to do with Egypt really.

05:58.333 --> 06:00.625
They didn't have that
back then, did they? No.

06:00.708 --> 06:03.500
They liked figs and dates, and...

06:03.583 --> 06:07.125
My next tour's here but just checking,
we still on for00 tomorrow?

06:08.625 --> 06:12.375
-"00 tomorrow"?
-"Best steak in town"?

06:12.666 --> 06:15.166
-Oh, yeah. Right. Yeah.
-Yeah? Okay.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.625
Sorry. But...

06:18.500 --> 06:20.916
-What?
-Are you asking me out?

06:24.208 --> 06:27.750
-You're funny. I'll see you then.

06:28.500 --> 06:32.166
Stevie, you absolute rascal.
I didn't know you had taken a crack.

06:32.625 --> 06:33.833
I didn't know either.

06:34.416 --> 06:36.000
Hang on, did she say steak?

06:36.083 --> 06:38.875
What in the world's a bloody vegan
gonna eat in a steak house?

06:38.958 --> 06:41.291
I don't know, Donna. Salad? Bread?

06:42.416 --> 06:46.208
Yeah, I can see why she went for it.
Real catch you are.

06:52.333 --> 06:55.250
-Bring those hippos up here, will you?
-Yeah, sure.

06:55.333 --> 06:59.416
Taweret. The hippo, Goddess Taweret.
Oh, Donna, that reminds me.

06:59.500 --> 07:02.041
When I was coming in this morning,
I saw the banners outside.

07:02.125 --> 07:04.208
And that's what made you
late for work again, was it?

07:04.291 --> 07:05.291
No. Sorry about that.

07:05.416 --> 07:07.083
-The bus came early...
-Third time this week

07:07.250 --> 07:09.166
-you've shuffled in like a lazy sod.
-I know.

07:09.250 --> 07:12.000
That's why you'll be
on inventory this week. Well done.

07:12.375 --> 07:13.916
All right. Aye, aye, Captain.

07:14.416 --> 07:15.666
But no. I wanted to tell you that

07:15.750 --> 07:18.333
the banners and the posters
of the Ennead...

07:18.416 --> 07:19.791
-The what?
-The Ennead?

07:19.916 --> 07:22.208
You know, like,
the super group of Egyptian gods?

07:22.291 --> 07:25.541
-You got Horus, Osiris, Tefnut...
-Stop, please.

07:25.625 --> 07:29.458
If this is some weird audition
to tour guide here, the answer's still no.

07:29.541 --> 07:32.541
No. What I'm trying...
That's actually crushing to hear.

07:32.625 --> 07:34.666
But what I'm trying to point out...

07:34.750 --> 07:38.250
I'm not trying to slag off marketing,
but there's been a major blunder

07:38.333 --> 07:41.250
because they've got seven gods here,
and the Ennead has nine.

07:41.333 --> 07:43.291
I fired two of them for bein' late.

07:43.375 --> 07:48.166
Listen, if you don't stop natterin' at me,
I swear I'll shove you in a sarcophagus.

07:48.250 --> 07:51.083
You can tell the pharaoh in there
what's wrong with them and all.

07:52.208 --> 07:53.833
-Go on.
-All right.

07:54.666 --> 07:57.166
-Go. Now. Oh, leave it.
-Yeah. I'm sorry.

07:57.250 --> 08:00.000
Just leave it. Get out. Go away from me.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.750
All right, always lovely to chat.

08:08.875 --> 08:12.083
-Hey. Good night, J.B.
-Good night, Scotty.

08:12.375 --> 08:14.291
-See ya, mate.
-Scotty?

08:16.166 --> 08:18.791
It's Steven. With a "V".

08:18.875 --> 08:19.958
J.B.: Huh.

08:21.833 --> 08:22.875
See you tomorrow.

08:24.625 --> 08:28.000
Honestly, it's like
my body wants to get up

08:28.333 --> 08:32.166
and wander about, you know, like it
has to get the 10,000 steps in.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.375
You know? And I don't even
know about it until I wake up wherever.

08:37.708 --> 08:40.916
That's why I try to stay awake
at night. What do you think?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.041
Nah. You're right. I mean, I guess

08:43.125 --> 08:45.625
there are stranger things
that people do, but...

08:45.958 --> 08:49.083
No? Well, I think
it's a bit... I'm sorry.

08:50.541 --> 08:52.625
Extra pralines for the man himself.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.333
So, the girl I was telling you about,
the one from work.

08:56.416 --> 08:58.333
-We're going on a date tomorrow.
-Excuse me.

08:58.416 --> 09:00.208
-Can you take our picture with him?
-Sure.

09:00.291 --> 09:01.750
-Thank you.
-We're going on a date.

09:01.833 --> 09:04.333
I didn't even ask her.
I don't know how it happened.

09:05.666 --> 09:07.083
One. Two. Three.

09:08.625 --> 09:10.375
-There you are. Cheers.
-Thank you.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.750
-Don't forget the tip.
-Oh, yes.

09:14.541 --> 09:15.708
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

09:16.916 --> 09:20.958
Anyway, if I am gonna have
a girlfriend, at some point,

09:22.791 --> 09:25.458
obviously can't have
ankle restraints on my bed, can I?

09:25.583 --> 09:28.500
That's like the definition
of a red flag, isn't it?

09:29.458 --> 09:32.583
You know what I mean, yeah?
Yeah, you know what I mean.

09:33.250 --> 09:34.708
Gotta figure something out.

09:37.375 --> 09:39.791
All right, I better jog on.

09:41.166 --> 09:42.416
Nice catching up.

09:43.833 --> 09:47.166
I will see you on the flip-flop.

09:47.541 --> 09:49.791
-All right, laters.

10:15.541 --> 10:18.291
Hello! And welcome to Staying Awake.

10:19.041 --> 10:21.708
Let's start with trying to solve a puzzle.

10:21.791 --> 10:24.666
Solving puzzles is a great way
to keep your mind awake.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.500
Bored with puzzles? Try a book.

10:29.125 --> 10:31.583
Reading can keep
your mind alert and focused.

10:32.333 --> 10:34.750
Imagine being in the story you're reading.

10:34.833 --> 10:37.500
Is there an exciting chapter
you'd like to be a part of?

10:38.791 --> 10:42.500
Just remember, you'll need about
five hours to keep your natural self.

10:44.041 --> 10:47.083
Hello! And welcome to
Staying Awake.

10:47.166 --> 10:49.458
Let's start with trying to solve a puzzle.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.333
Solving puzzles is a great way
to keep your mind awake.

10:52.416 --> 10:53.791
Bored with puzzles?

10:54.750 --> 10:56.041
Try a book.

10:56.166 --> 11:00.333
Hello! Reading... Is there a chapter
you'd like to be a part of?

11:13.666 --> 11:14.791
Oh, my God.

11:19.208 --> 11:20.291
Ah!

11:20.375 --> 11:23.375
Oh, that was weird.
What happened?

11:24.166 --> 11:26.125
What... What was that?

11:38.583 --> 11:40.958
-Go back to sleep, worm.
-Hello?

11:43.583 --> 11:47.541
-You're not supposed to be here.
-Yep. I completely agree.

11:49.166 --> 11:52.541
-Where are you?
-Surrender the body to Marc.

11:53.208 --> 11:55.750
Sorry, what? "The body"? What...

11:57.333 --> 12:01.208
-"Surrender the body"? What body?
-Oh, the idiot's in control.

12:15.416 --> 12:16.500
Hello.

12:18.166 --> 12:19.250
Hi...

12:21.041 --> 12:22.041
What are you doing?

12:22.333 --> 12:23.541
No, no, no!

12:23.625 --> 12:25.750
Don't just stand there. Run!

12:25.833 --> 12:28.041
-No, no, no! No! Please!

12:42.250 --> 12:44.083
He's heading for the village.

13:41.375 --> 13:42.791
What a beautiful day.

13:43.250 --> 13:46.166
It's like we're in Heaven.
Only it's not Heaven, is it?

13:47.875 --> 13:50.833
It's a darkness. Sometimes
it hides in our very hearts.

13:50.916 --> 13:54.083
We are here to make the Earth
as much like Heaven as possible.

13:55.583 --> 13:56.875
Who'd like to go first?

14:00.791 --> 14:04.500
You're a brave man.
Offering your soul for judgment.

14:04.583 --> 14:08.291
Wanting to serve our goddess
even before she wakes.

14:14.375 --> 14:20.083
I judge you in Ammit's name
with but a fraction of her power.

14:27.833 --> 14:30.666
This is the face of a good man.

14:30.791 --> 14:32.083
-Thank you.

14:44.458 --> 14:46.041
Who would like to go next?

14:46.500 --> 14:49.750
Please, Harrow. I must know.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.041
Call me Arthur. Come.

14:52.125 --> 14:56.041
Will you accept your scales,
regardless of the outcome?

14:56.125 --> 14:57.250
Yes.

15:05.958 --> 15:07.291
I'm sorry.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.916
I've been good my entire life.

15:14.041 --> 15:15.291
I believe you.

15:17.125 --> 15:21.750
But the scales see everything.
Perhaps it's something that lies ahead.

15:22.541 --> 15:26.791
Well... I wish you could live
to see the world we make.

15:27.125 --> 15:29.333
Yet, Ammit has decided.

15:48.500 --> 15:52.958
I'm sorry. There was
a problem with the exchange.

15:53.041 --> 15:56.000
We got ambushed.
Someone killed two of our men.

15:56.583 --> 15:57.833
Is he still here?

15:58.583 --> 16:00.000
We think so, yes.

16:04.916 --> 16:07.041
-- Oh, bollocks.
-- You...

16:09.208 --> 16:10.541
I know you.

16:11.375 --> 16:13.333
Me? Hi, uh...

16:14.833 --> 16:15.958
Mercenary.

16:16.958 --> 16:19.125
"Mercenary"? No, no. I'm not a mercenary.

16:19.208 --> 16:21.458
No, I'm a gift shop-ist.

16:22.250 --> 16:25.333
I work at a gift shop.
My name's Steven Grant.

16:25.625 --> 16:26.625
Uh...

16:27.208 --> 16:29.375
I'm trying to get back home.
Back to London.

16:29.875 --> 16:33.583
London?
Don't know why I'm saying it like that.

16:33.666 --> 16:36.791
-Well, Steven Grant of the gift shop.
-Yeah?

16:36.875 --> 16:41.083
-Will you return the scarab?
-The... The what? Oh, all right.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.291
Yeah, the... Oh, you mean...

16:44.375 --> 16:47.833
-You will give him nothing.
-Here.

16:52.791 --> 16:56.166
I strongly encourage you to return that.

16:56.750 --> 16:59.208
I'm not... I'm...

17:02.666 --> 17:03.666
I'm try...

17:04.041 --> 17:07.916
Come on, now. It's like
my fingers froze.

17:08.583 --> 17:12.708
But here's some of that... I don't know,
maybe it's the high altitude or something.

17:12.833 --> 17:13.833
Ah!

17:13.916 --> 17:16.208
There, take it. So strange. Sorry, but...

17:17.458 --> 17:20.041
-I will not ask again.
-I didn't do that on purpose.

17:20.708 --> 17:22.583
I don't know what's happening.

17:24.125 --> 17:26.458
There we go. Just take it,
take it, take it, take it.

17:26.583 --> 17:28.708
-Oh, God! Now I'm trying to stop my legs.
-Take him!

17:28.791 --> 17:32.875
I can't... I'm trying to stop my legs from
moving. I'm trying to give it to you.

17:32.958 --> 17:35.000
-Wait, wait, wait!
-It's all right.

17:35.083 --> 17:37.875
I'm trying, mate.
I swear I'm trying to give it to you.

17:40.791 --> 17:41.916
Got it!

17:45.208 --> 17:47.875
No. The idiot's back.

17:48.250 --> 17:49.250
Ah...

17:49.666 --> 17:50.666
Oh...

17:52.500 --> 17:53.500
Sorry.

17:54.375 --> 17:55.375
Oh, God.

17:58.833 --> 18:02.833
I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna go, all right? Yeah.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.208
Oh, God. Oh, God.

18:06.416 --> 18:09.708
I see you're angry. I know
I've made you angry. I'm sorry, yeah?

18:09.791 --> 18:11.958
Please, I don't...

18:13.833 --> 18:14.916
Oh, God.

18:15.041 --> 18:16.833
Don't you dare
drop the scarab.

18:16.916 --> 18:18.375
All right, all right, all right!

18:22.625 --> 18:25.916
That is my van! That is my van!

18:37.541 --> 18:40.708
What am I doing? What am I doing?
I don't even have my license.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.916
-Oh, my God.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.833
Bugger, there's so many of them.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.958
This has to be a dream.
This has to be a dream.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.041
They're gonna kill me.
They're gonna kill me.

18:56.125 --> 18:59.291
Come on, you bloody
cupcake van! Move it!

19:19.208 --> 19:24.000
Come on! Move your ass!
Thank you. So sorry. Thank you.

19:25.250 --> 19:26.250
Charming.

19:44.250 --> 19:49.500
Wait, wait, wait! I'm sorry, I'm sorry
about the cupcake. No, no, no!

19:57.083 --> 20:00.791
Wake up, Marc! If he loses
the scarab, I'll kill you both.

20:00.916 --> 20:02.666
I don't understand what's happening!

20:02.791 --> 20:04.333
-Truck, stupid!
-What?

20:04.416 --> 20:05.458
Truck!

20:20.458 --> 20:21.458
No!

20:23.541 --> 20:25.125
Oh, no, no, no!

20:34.833 --> 20:36.291
Huh? Oh, God.

20:37.958 --> 20:39.375
I'm driving backwards.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.791
-Did he just throw the gun?
-I don't know what I'm doing.

20:45.916 --> 20:47.750
Then leave us be, parasite!

20:55.333 --> 20:58.250
-Oh, come on, come on.

21:09.958 --> 21:11.041
Oh, shit!

21:26.625 --> 21:28.250
Oh, God.

21:28.333 --> 21:30.666
Oh, God.

21:43.083 --> 21:45.958
What Neanderthals dreamed of.
The paleoanthropologists...

21:46.958 --> 21:49.208
How we doin', Gus? You sleep all right?

21:49.458 --> 21:50.458
Hmm?

21:52.125 --> 21:53.916
I wonder what fishes dream about.

22:12.375 --> 22:14.625
What the... Fish.

22:16.208 --> 22:17.666
What do you mean, "grew back"?

22:17.750 --> 22:20.708
Yesterday, that fish had one fin.
It was like that when I bought him.

22:20.791 --> 22:22.875
-Today, what do you see?
-I see two...

22:22.958 --> 22:26.000
Two fins! Yeah, sorry.
But, yeah, he's got two fins now.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.875
So, is that normal, or...

22:27.958 --> 22:29.541
Well, if you wanna
swap it, go ahead.

22:29.625 --> 22:31.625
But, like I said yesterday,
they've all got...

22:31.708 --> 22:33.583
What do you mean?
I wasn't here yesterday.

22:33.666 --> 22:34.708
Yeah, all right.

22:34.791 --> 22:37.666
Look, as I said, they've all got two fins.

22:37.750 --> 22:39.625
I don't care what that Nemo movie says.

22:39.708 --> 22:42.291
Find a pet shop that sells
disabled fish and go there.

22:42.375 --> 22:45.208
-I don't have time for this.
-Wait, is that... Is that clock right?

22:45.291 --> 22:46.916
No, that's impossible,
I just woke up.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.750
Are you mad? The fish is wrong,
the time is wrong. You're not quite right.

22:51.291 --> 22:53.708
Bugger, I've got a date.
Sorry, I've got a date.

23:01.541 --> 23:02.666
All right.

23:07.875 --> 23:09.125
You look like a knob.

23:13.916 --> 23:15.916
We still expecting one more?

23:17.041 --> 23:19.375
Yes. It's not looking so good, is it?

23:34.500 --> 23:36.500
Punchy. Calling me now?

23:37.208 --> 23:42.791
What? What do you mean? I'm at
the restaurant for steak. It's steak time.

23:43.666 --> 23:46.791
Yeah, I ate steak by myself, thanks.
Two days ago.

23:47.833 --> 23:50.416
What? I thought we said Friday? Today.

23:51.125 --> 23:53.291
Right. Welcome to Sunday.

23:54.208 --> 23:59.250
Come on, no. I think Friday
still comes after Thursday, doesn't it?

23:59.416 --> 24:01.541
It doesn't change the fact
that today is Sunday,

24:01.625 --> 24:03.416
which means "lose my number."

24:03.500 --> 24:05.416
Cheers.

24:05.750 --> 24:06.916
-But...

24:10.250 --> 24:12.750
Sorry, what day is it today?

24:13.791 --> 24:15.750
-Sunday, sir.
-No.

24:16.208 --> 24:17.208
Is it...

24:17.541 --> 24:18.541
Really?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.666
The kitchen's closing soon.

24:24.291 --> 24:27.208
Okay. Um... You know what?

24:28.916 --> 24:30.250
I'll have a steak, please.

24:31.083 --> 24:33.583
Sure. What cut would you like?

24:35.333 --> 24:36.333
I see.

24:36.458 --> 24:37.458
Um...

24:38.000 --> 24:41.083
I'll have the best bit of the...

24:42.041 --> 24:44.166
The steak.
That's the bit that I want.

24:45.041 --> 24:48.708
The center-cut's filet.
And how would you like that?

24:49.791 --> 24:52.458
Good, yeah. Very good. Very good. Yeah.

24:54.208 --> 24:57.208
-I'll... I'll put you for well done.
-Okay. All right.

24:57.291 --> 25:00.083
Yeah. That sounds delicious.

25:09.083 --> 25:12.125
Yeah, you know,
I think she really liked me.

25:12.208 --> 25:15.291
She loved the flowers. Yeah.

25:15.750 --> 25:18.500
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
bring her around soon, I think.

25:18.583 --> 25:22.041
Yeah, I think you'd love her.
Yeah, she's got a great sense of humor.

25:22.125 --> 25:26.958
So... Anyway, I'll tell you more about it
tomorrow. Love you. Laters, gators.

26:05.916 --> 26:07.500
Do you want some?

26:10.958 --> 26:12.083
All right.

26:13.125 --> 26:14.916
You can have some sprinkles.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.083
If you're Gus,
I'm the bloody Queen of Sheba.

26:43.875 --> 26:44.916
What's this?

27:20.416 --> 27:21.708
What is this about?

27:47.583 --> 27:49.916
-There we are.

27:50.083 --> 27:51.250
All right.

27:57.333 --> 27:58.333
Layla.

28:14.791 --> 28:16.166
Yeah?

28:16.250 --> 28:17.708
Oh, my God, you're alive.

28:17.791 --> 28:20.250
-Yeah, all right.
-That's it?

28:20.666 --> 28:23.000
I've been texting
and calling you for months.

28:23.083 --> 28:25.500
You couldn't give me
any sign that you were okay?

28:25.625 --> 28:27.666
I thought something
happened to you.

28:27.750 --> 28:29.958
Where are you?
Where've you been?

28:30.041 --> 28:31.166
Uh...

28:31.791 --> 28:33.458
Hello? You...

28:34.083 --> 28:36.625
Sorry, I just found this phone in my flat,

28:36.708 --> 28:39.333
and I'm just trying
to figure out whose it is.

28:39.416 --> 28:41.291
-What is with this accent?
-What?

28:41.916 --> 28:43.250
What is happening right now?

28:43.333 --> 28:46.250
Sorry, who do you think I am?

28:46.333 --> 28:49.333
What do you mean, "who"?
What's wrong with you, Marc?

28:51.083 --> 28:52.541
What did you just call me?

28:54.083 --> 28:55.083
Who is this?

28:57.000 --> 28:59.125
Why did you call me "Marc"?

29:01.041 --> 29:02.458
-Hello?

29:04.916 --> 29:06.750
-No, no, no. Come on.

29:10.041 --> 29:11.083
Steven.

29:14.541 --> 29:15.625
Steven.

29:18.916 --> 29:21.250
-Hello?
-Steven.

29:24.208 --> 29:27.250
-You need to stop.
-Who said that?

29:33.458 --> 29:36.500
-You're gonna get yourself in trouble.
-Oh, no, no, no, mate.

29:36.583 --> 29:38.291
Someone's having a laugh.

29:49.708 --> 29:51.791
Oh, God. Oh, God.

29:59.375 --> 30:00.416
Bloody hell.

30:03.625 --> 30:04.625
What the...

30:17.791 --> 30:18.875
Steven.

30:20.458 --> 30:22.041
Stop looking.

30:27.875 --> 30:29.416
Oh, God. What's happening?

30:29.958 --> 30:30.958
What's happening?

30:34.208 --> 30:35.583
Oh, God!

31:06.750 --> 31:10.666
No, G. G, G. Let's go.
Come on. Ground floor.

31:35.708 --> 31:37.041
Hold the door.

31:37.125 --> 31:38.416
-Thank you.

31:48.750 --> 31:49.750
Hiya.

31:50.291 --> 31:51.791
-Hi.
-You all right?

31:52.416 --> 31:54.041
Fine. Thank you.

31:54.250 --> 31:56.583
Just lost my contact lens.

31:57.666 --> 31:58.791
Hope you find it.

31:59.916 --> 32:02.333
Electrical problems
in the building, innit?

32:02.416 --> 32:03.916
Always the same, isn't it?

32:04.708 --> 32:06.916
-Are we back on the fifth floor?
-Yes, the fifth.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.708
My friend Claire lives here.
I'm visiting her.

32:10.083 --> 32:11.833
She's expecting me.

32:14.333 --> 32:15.500
What's going on?

32:47.208 --> 32:50.000
Oh, my God. He's real.

32:59.333 --> 33:00.666
Hey, J.B., how you doin', mate?

33:00.750 --> 33:03.125
-How's it going, Scotty? All right, mate.
-It's Steven.

33:03.208 --> 33:06.000
-Are you watching otter videos again?
-They're adorable, mate.

33:06.083 --> 33:07.458
Great, yeah. Cool. Listen, man,

33:07.541 --> 33:10.750
I need you to keep an eye out,
'cause I'm being followed.

33:10.833 --> 33:13.208
-Really, mate?
-Yeah. Will you just,

33:13.291 --> 33:16.500
-like, not let anyone in, yeah?
-It's a museum. That'll be difficult.

33:16.583 --> 33:18.750
Obviously. I just mean,
like, anyone dodgy.

33:18.833 --> 33:20.708
Anyone who wants
to come in can, it's free.

33:20.791 --> 33:23.125
-I get it. This man...
-Can you take these downstairs?

33:23.208 --> 33:24.666
-Wait. I know.
-Gotta go, it's Mom.

33:24.750 --> 33:26.833
-I get it. Just a second.
-Take it downstairs now.

33:26.916 --> 33:29.625
-Just help me out...
-Can you take this downstairs, please?

33:29.958 --> 33:32.250
Oh, my God.
That man was on the bus.

33:32.333 --> 33:34.500
I don't give a monkey's.
Take these downstairs...

33:34.583 --> 33:37.875
Will you...
Please, just give me a minute?

33:37.958 --> 33:39.958
Yeah? Thanks, Donna.

33:40.666 --> 33:42.833
You're still on inventory tonight.

33:57.708 --> 33:59.916
-So you really do work here.
-Oh, God.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.416
I'd assumed Steven Grant was an alias.
Imagine my surprise to find you here.

34:04.500 --> 34:07.291
Excuse me, Ronnie. This man
right here has been following me.

34:07.375 --> 34:09.041
-Now, I don't know...
-Praise Ammit.

34:10.458 --> 34:14.250
-Thank you.
-Ronnie, you're part of this?

34:16.708 --> 34:19.625
Mate, I don't have
your bloody beetle. I swear. I...

34:19.708 --> 34:24.333
Oh, no. The scarab doesn't belong to me.
It belongs to her. Do you know Ammit?

34:25.541 --> 34:27.958
Do I know Ammit... No, not personally.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.541
Egyptian deity, right?

34:31.750 --> 34:33.250
World's first bogeyman.

34:33.333 --> 34:36.541
She was only
the bogeyman for evildoers.

34:36.625 --> 34:38.791
-Right.
-She grew weary of having to wait

34:38.875 --> 34:41.375
for sinners to commit their crime
before punishing them.

34:41.541 --> 34:44.250
Would you wait to weed a garden
till after the roses were dead?

34:44.375 --> 34:45.750
I wouldn't do that.

34:45.833 --> 34:49.458
The justice of Ammit surveys
the whole of our lives.

34:49.541 --> 34:51.500
-Got it.
-Past, present, future.

34:51.583 --> 34:53.708
She knows what we've done,
and what we will do.

34:53.791 --> 34:56.833
Great. Okay. Well, the books
must have left that part out.

35:04.250 --> 35:05.375
Consider this...

35:05.958 --> 35:08.791
Had Ammit been free, she would have

35:08.875 --> 35:11.375
prevented Hitler
and the destruction he wrought.

35:12.041 --> 35:15.583
Nero, the Armenian genocide, Pol Pot.

35:15.666 --> 35:18.041
-Not nice people.
-But she was betrayed.

35:18.125 --> 35:21.750
-Was she?
-By indolent fellow gods.

35:21.916 --> 35:24.291
-By even her own Avatar.

35:24.375 --> 35:27.125
"Avatars." Blue people.
Love that film.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.416
-By Avatar, what I mean...
-You mean the anime?

35:29.500 --> 35:32.958
-Steven. Stop it.
-Are you going to kill me?

35:40.125 --> 35:41.791
It's maddening, isn't it?

35:42.875 --> 35:45.250
The voice in your head.

35:46.500 --> 35:50.250
Relentless, forever unsatisfied.

35:50.625 --> 35:53.291
No matter how hard you try to please,

35:54.291 --> 35:57.208
it devours you
until there's nothing left

35:58.083 --> 35:59.583
but a hollow shell.

36:00.166 --> 36:02.250
And the more you ask for help,

36:02.375 --> 36:05.666
the more you begin to sound
like the boy who cried wolf.

36:05.791 --> 36:08.291
I can't help you.

36:09.041 --> 36:11.083
I am trying to help you.

36:12.833 --> 36:15.083
I saw you kill that woman in the Alps.

36:15.708 --> 36:18.958
I only told her what
millions more will soon learn.

36:20.291 --> 36:21.750
Do you wanna know the truth?

36:42.708 --> 36:44.333
There's chaos in you.

36:44.958 --> 36:46.041
There's what?

36:53.208 --> 36:54.291
Let him go.

37:31.833 --> 37:33.166
Oh, bloody hell.

37:37.916 --> 37:40.333
Hello? Donna?

37:41.083 --> 37:42.083
J.B.?

37:42.958 --> 37:45.125
Pets allowed in the museum.

37:46.375 --> 37:48.125
Here, boy.

37:50.083 --> 37:51.166
Hello?

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
Where are you, you little bugger?

38:02.958 --> 38:04.583
What are you doing, Steven?

38:06.208 --> 38:07.333
Here, boy.

38:09.875 --> 38:10.916
Hello?

38:16.041 --> 38:17.333
Oh, classic.

38:18.666 --> 38:20.375
I hear you, can you hear me?

38:23.125 --> 38:24.333
Oh.

38:26.708 --> 38:27.958
Yeah.

38:51.125 --> 38:54.375
Steven Grant of the gift shop.

38:54.458 --> 38:58.250
Give me the scarab
and you won't be torn apart.

39:27.125 --> 39:28.291
Good Lord!

39:32.333 --> 39:33.541
Oh, God!

39:36.333 --> 39:37.625
Oh, God.

39:39.166 --> 39:40.333
Steven...

39:41.000 --> 39:43.041
Steven, I can save us.

39:44.666 --> 39:47.083
But I can't have you
fightin' me this time.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.291
You need to give me control.
You understand?

39:50.375 --> 39:52.958
No, what... Control of what?
What are you talking about?

39:53.041 --> 39:56.416
That thing's about to break through
the door. We're out of time.

39:56.500 --> 39:58.916
-All right, hey. Listen to me.
-Damn it! No!

39:59.000 --> 40:00.083
-Listen. Look at me.
-No!

40:00.166 --> 40:01.500
-Look at me.
-You're not real!

40:01.583 --> 40:04.041
-This is real. I'm real.
-No! You're not real.

40:04.125 --> 40:07.083
-None of this is real.
-Yes. Steven. You gotta give me control.

40:07.166 --> 40:08.583
It's the only way.

40:08.708 --> 40:11.791
-Oh, God. I'm gonna die.
-You... Steven.

40:11.875 --> 40:14.458
-I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die.
-Look at me.

40:15.208 --> 40:16.458
You're not gonna die.

40:18.500 --> 40:19.708
Let me save us.
