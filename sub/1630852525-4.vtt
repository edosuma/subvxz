00:08.875 --> 00:11.411
- Hello, everyone.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.813
I thought I'd make this video while in the bath

00:13.880 --> 00:17.684
because lately I've been feeling,

00:17.751 --> 00:21.321
well, naked.

00:21.388 --> 00:22.655
I've been working on something

00:22.722 --> 00:26.693
that's been taking up a lot of my time.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.595
And I'm about to apply myself

00:28.695 --> 00:33.666
more than I ever have in my entire life.

00:33.733 --> 00:37.837
I've fully aligned with my purpose.

00:37.904 --> 00:39.506
And I can't wait to share the news with you.

00:39.572 --> 00:41.408
But the timing isn't quite right.

00:41.508 --> 00:43.777
But what I can tell you

00:43.877 --> 00:46.346
is that it is going to directly affect

00:46.413 --> 00:48.515
the existence of you

00:48.581 --> 00:51.584
and everyone you've ever met.

00:51.684 --> 00:53.787
This is going to be irreversible.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.855
But don't be scared.

00:55.922 --> 00:58.725
This is a mission of Lyte.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.728
- Well, look at you,

01:01.795 --> 01:03.463
all sexy and enlightened.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.265
- That's me.

01:05.365 --> 01:07.967
You know, Portia, I really have to thank you

01:08.068 --> 01:09.602
for pushing me to do this endeavor.

01:09.702 --> 01:12.872
It's gonna be the biggest thing since sliced bread.

01:12.939 --> 01:14.808
And I owe it all to you.

01:14.908 --> 01:18.545
- Dory, I can't tell you how much that means to me.

01:18.611 --> 01:22.482
I wish we could just melt into the same person.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.484
Why can't we do that?

01:24.584 --> 01:25.919
Can we just invent that already?

01:25.985 --> 01:28.655
- One thing at a time.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.824
- Hey. Do you want to get dinner with me tonight?

01:30.924 --> 01:32.225
There's this really cute spot,

01:32.292 --> 01:35.128
and it has outdoor seating and gorgeous lighting.

01:35.228 --> 01:36.563
- That sounds lovely.

01:36.629 --> 01:38.331
But let's see how the day plays out, okay?

01:38.431 --> 01:41.601
- Yeah.

01:41.668 --> 01:43.069
Yeah, we'll just see how the day plays out.

01:43.136 --> 01:47.240
I love that 'cause it's kind of being present and--

01:47.307 --> 01:49.342
should I make a rez?

02:29.015 --> 02:30.183
- Thank you.

02:30.283 --> 02:31.684
Oh, wow.

02:31.784 --> 02:33.186
- Nice, right? - Mm-hmm.

02:33.286 --> 02:35.054
- Yeah. - Yeah.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.556
- This isn't bad.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.725
- No, it's like super sexy.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.994
- Yeah, of course. - Thank you so much.

02:41.060 --> 02:42.395
- Oh, course. Yeah.

02:42.495 --> 02:45.498
You know, I like to treat you like the princess that you are.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.335
- Uh, Joe.

02:49.402 --> 02:50.703
There's something that I really need to tell you

02:50.803 --> 02:52.572
and I feel, like, really nervous to say it.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.574
- Okay. No, hey, hey.

02:54.674 --> 02:57.177
Look, you know you can tell me anything, right?

02:57.243 --> 02:59.979
I'm--I'm your supportive lover.

03:01.915 --> 03:04.551
I just want you to know, like, you really mean so much to me

03:04.651 --> 03:07.086
and, like, I think I'm kind of seeing someone.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.756
Like, I don't want to say too much about it because,

03:09.856 --> 03:12.058
you know, it's really new to me in a lot of ways.

03:12.158 --> 03:13.726
But, um, yeah.

03:13.826 --> 03:17.030
- Wow. I'm--um--

03:17.096 --> 03:18.765
I'm actually relieved. - What?

03:18.865 --> 03:21.701
- I may be kinda seeing someone too.

03:21.768 --> 03:23.436
- You? - Yeah, it's complicated.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.939
- Oh, my God. - I'm just trying to process it

03:26.039 --> 03:28.241
'cause it's actually extremely confusing.

03:28.341 --> 03:31.277
And I have a lot of conflicting feelings about it, but--

03:31.377 --> 03:33.947
- I hope I get to meet her one day.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.582
- Yeah.

03:35.682 --> 03:38.451
Yeah. Yeah, you too. - Yeah.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.053
- I hope he makes you really happy.

03:47.026 --> 03:48.795
- Oh! Wow!

03:48.895 --> 03:49.963
- Oh, wow.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.031
- Oh, my gosh.

03:52.098 --> 03:54.200
Ah, this is it. This is it.

03:54.267 --> 03:55.468
Yes, this is where we're gonna do it.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.804
This is our new home.

03:57.904 --> 04:01.207
- Yeah, yeah. God, this is so perfect.

04:01.274 --> 04:02.775
This is just exactly what it should be.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.911
- You know, I told them. I said I don't want offices.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.313
You know, no divisions, no secrets.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.083
Just community.

04:10.149 --> 04:13.553
- Oh, ah, my best friends.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.555
Isn't this place of the times?

04:15.622 --> 04:17.624
I got the design team from Selfie Castle.

04:17.724 --> 04:18.658
Doesn't it just make you

04:18.758 --> 04:19.993
want to take a million pictures of yourself?

04:20.093 --> 04:21.261
- That is so smart.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.463
People are just gonna be so jealous that we get to, like,

04:23.563 --> 04:27.300
sit and, like, stand in here.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.802
- Hey, you want to see the, um, lab?

04:29.902 --> 04:31.838
- The lab? Yes.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.273
God, it sounds so cool to hear it.

04:33.339 --> 04:34.440
- Yeah. - It's so cool to hear.

04:34.507 --> 04:36.342
- Yeah. The lab.

04:40.079 --> 04:42.315
- Oh, boy. Here we go, the lab.

04:46.753 --> 04:49.255
Everybody, this is our resident genius

04:49.322 --> 04:51.024
Dr. Benny Balthazar.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.191
- Hi.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.793
- Hello. - Hi.

04:53.860 --> 04:54.827
- Hi.

04:54.927 --> 04:57.630
- Very excited to be making history.

04:57.697 --> 05:01.834
- Yeah. Benny graduated first in her class at MIT.

05:01.934 --> 05:04.704
It doesn't get more science-y than Benny.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.172
- Oh, my God. MIT.

05:06.272 --> 05:07.440
That's actually one of the schools

05:07.507 --> 05:09.375
I consider pretending to go to, so.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.811
- Oh, yes. I read about your lies.

05:11.878 --> 05:12.812
- Oh, thank you.

05:12.879 --> 05:13.946
- Well, Benny,

05:14.013 --> 05:16.282
it is an honor to embark on this journey with you.

05:16.349 --> 05:19.852
- Yeah, it's gonna be huge.

05:19.952 --> 05:23.489
- Well, do you mind showing us what y'all are up to?

05:23.556 --> 05:25.224
- Sure. So, obviously,

05:25.325 --> 05:27.894
we're gonna start with targeted amplicon sequencing.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.228
- Of course, obviously.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.397
- And then x-ray crystallography.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.199
We'll see where that gets us.

05:33.299 --> 05:35.902
So we have the most sophisticated technology

05:36.002 --> 05:37.303
in here.

05:37.370 --> 05:39.405
Equipment that some of the most well-funded labs

05:39.505 --> 05:42.141
in the world don't have access to.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.677
This is the most comprehensive library

05:44.744 --> 05:47.246
of natural and synthetic chemical samples

05:47.347 --> 05:49.148
that the world has ever seen.

05:49.215 --> 05:51.918
You could do absolutely anything with these.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.587
If there's a way to cure cancer, it's in here.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.089
- Oh, well, that would have come in handy

05:56.189 --> 05:57.590
when I pretended to have cancer.

05:57.690 --> 06:00.493
- Nobody is allowed in there ever.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.728
In the wrong hands,

06:01.828 --> 06:04.864
this could start World War III.

06:04.931 --> 06:07.500
So we are using a new technology

06:07.567 --> 06:10.370
that visually maps neurochemical reactions

06:10.436 --> 06:13.506
as they're occurring live in our test subject.

06:13.573 --> 06:16.743
We're looking for anything traditionally associated

06:16.843 --> 06:18.344
with enlightenment.

06:18.411 --> 06:20.546
The idea being that we can reverse engineer

06:20.613 --> 06:23.583
the chemical recipe for what you experienced.

06:23.683 --> 06:24.784
- Hmm.

06:26.185 --> 06:28.287
I'm sorry, but this doesn't feel

06:28.388 --> 06:30.757
quite right to me.

06:30.857 --> 06:32.392
To reduce my experience

06:32.458 --> 06:35.261
to just chemicals.

06:35.361 --> 06:37.597
What I went through was so much more than that.

06:37.697 --> 06:39.298
It was spiritual,

06:39.399 --> 06:41.467
metaphysical,

06:41.567 --> 06:44.137
divine.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.272
I died.

06:46.372 --> 06:48.641
And then I came back.

06:48.741 --> 06:52.745
That's what the pill should be doing.

06:52.812 --> 06:58.317
- Yeah, well, uh, we'll look into that.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.756
- Oh, hey, thank you. Thank you.

07:06.292 --> 07:07.560
Thank you. Hi, Kate. Hi, Jose.

07:07.627 --> 07:10.596
Welcome. Try everything. I liked the soda pop.

07:10.663 --> 07:13.065
I like the cherries. They're all good.

07:13.132 --> 07:15.735
- I'm sorry. Do we own this candy store too?

07:15.802 --> 07:17.170
- Oh, we don't own it.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.006
No, they shut it down when I come in

07:20.106 --> 07:22.675
'cause I think best when I got in candy me.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.911
I, in fact, I'm micro-dosing sugar.

07:24.977 --> 07:26.012
- Dor, Dor!

07:26.112 --> 07:27.647
They have my favorite candy from when I was a kid

07:27.747 --> 07:29.582
and they're really impossible to find.

07:29.649 --> 07:32.151
- They got everything here. Okay.

07:32.251 --> 07:35.354
Um, I--I--I think what we're essentially trying to do

07:35.455 --> 07:38.458
is to reinvent the wheel.

07:38.524 --> 07:41.127
Uh, so it could take the science

07:41.194 --> 07:42.628
a heck of a long time

07:42.695 --> 07:44.096
before it sees the light of day.

07:44.163 --> 07:45.431
So the question becomes,

07:45.498 --> 07:47.667
what are we gonna do in the meantime?

07:48.935 --> 07:51.671
- Research. And meditate.

07:51.771 --> 07:53.306
- Hmm. - No.

07:53.372 --> 07:55.842
We get people on board.

07:55.942 --> 07:58.211
We get them lining up around the block

07:58.311 --> 08:01.948
and, uh, just-- just clamoring for it.

08:02.014 --> 08:03.850
- Like, shouldn't we make a pill first?

08:03.950 --> 08:06.719
- No, I think we need to create the need

08:06.819 --> 08:09.155
before the technology.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.656
See what I'm thinking? - Mm-hmm.

08:10.723 --> 08:14.627
- I think we need to pull some kind of, you know, magic trick

08:14.694 --> 08:20.500
so that we hypnotize the entire country into joining our cause.

08:20.566 --> 08:21.667
And I know how to do it.

08:21.734 --> 08:25.204
We're gonna do it through a--a kind of a stunt.

08:28.374 --> 08:31.244
Here. Come here. Come around here. Come close.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.478
Get in a little tight, a little tight,

08:32.545 --> 08:34.380
a little grouping. Stay right there.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.182
- That's good. - Now...

08:36.249 --> 08:39.318
- All right. - Cast your gaze right about

08:39.385 --> 08:41.687
from where you are right around there.

08:41.754 --> 08:43.856
- Okay. - Watch this. Bing.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.224
- Oh. - Oh, my God.

08:45.324 --> 08:46.926
- You guys, it's like

08:47.026 --> 08:48.828
the future we've all been waiting for.

08:48.895 --> 08:51.831
- So what is this that we're looking at exactly?

08:51.898 --> 08:56.502
- Well, this is a very carefully curated group

08:56.569 --> 09:00.239
of the most popular social media influencers

09:00.339 --> 09:03.910
whose followership adds up to collectively

09:04.010 --> 09:06.913
about a third of the American population.

09:07.013 --> 09:09.415
They're just fantastic. So watch.

09:09.515 --> 09:12.351
I'm gonna isolate this lady right there.

09:12.418 --> 09:14.220
- Oh, my God. I know who that is.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.355
She looks, like, very hot in skates.

09:16.422 --> 09:18.558
That's exactly what men want.

09:18.624 --> 09:20.426
- And then there's this fella.

09:20.526 --> 09:22.395
- Oh, yeah, that's the pop scientist.

09:22.461 --> 09:24.964
He's like a joke in the legitimate science community.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.432
- Well, he's very likable.

09:26.532 --> 09:28.701
- No. - Here's the whole group again.

09:30.269 --> 09:31.804
- Wow.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.140
I don't think I recognize any of these people.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.475
- But I have very young researchers

09:36.576 --> 09:38.811
who assure me that this gang

09:38.911 --> 09:43.215
has the attention of basically the entire world.

09:43.282 --> 09:46.552
There we go. Goodbye. What do you think of that?

09:46.619 --> 09:47.920
- Aw!

09:47.987 --> 09:49.221
- So are you saying

09:49.288 --> 09:52.925
that you want these people to promote the pill?

09:52.992 --> 09:54.493
- Yeah. I want them to promote it.

09:54.594 --> 09:58.798
But also, I want them to be the first to take the pill.

09:58.898 --> 10:01.567
I think this could be a very exciting public example

10:01.634 --> 10:04.136
of what the road to enlightenment

10:04.236 --> 10:06.005
would look like exactly.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.174
- Hmm.

10:08.274 --> 10:11.911
Well, if we did this,

10:11.978 --> 10:15.514
I would want to feel connected to these people, you know,

10:15.615 --> 10:18.618
to build a relationship with them over time

10:18.684 --> 10:22.755
so that I can teach them and love them and really know them

10:22.822 --> 10:25.257
so that by the time we actually take the pill,

10:25.324 --> 10:28.995
we're like--we're like a real--a real family.

10:29.095 --> 10:31.998
- Like disciples.

10:32.098 --> 10:33.599
- Hmm. - Hmm.

10:33.666 --> 10:34.667
- Yeah.

10:34.767 --> 10:39.038
- Imagine a group of influencers

10:39.138 --> 10:42.675
living on the premises and live-ing,

10:42.775 --> 10:47.980
so to speak, 24/7 from Lyte Headquarters.

10:48.047 --> 10:50.783
- They live there?

10:50.850 --> 10:53.486
But they look so annoying.

10:53.552 --> 10:58.524
- Trust me, we need these folks to be on board.

10:58.624 --> 11:01.694
If they believe, so will everybody.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.496
- Oh, my God.

11:03.562 --> 11:04.497
I'm having an idea.

11:04.563 --> 11:05.998
I'm having an idea. Okay, okay.

11:06.065 --> 11:08.034
Maybe--maybe this sounds crazy.

11:08.134 --> 11:11.370
But what if we made it seem like

11:11.470 --> 11:14.974
anybody in America could be chosen for this,

11:15.041 --> 11:17.977
like a nationwide lottery?

11:18.044 --> 11:21.714
Like we act like there's this equal opportunity chance

11:21.814 --> 11:25.851
at exclusivity when really it's just preselected?

11:25.918 --> 11:28.921
- Oh, I love that idea. It's patriotic.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.823
- Well, it's something to chew on.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.758
Certainly.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.694
- You may have noticed an unusual package

11:34.760 --> 11:36.195
in your mailbox recently.

11:36.262 --> 11:38.831
That's because tech billionaire and public persona

11:38.898 --> 11:41.734
Tunnel Quinn is sending something your way.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.536
Quinn had purported on social media

11:43.602 --> 11:45.604
that he had hoped to have every single package

11:45.705 --> 11:48.841
delivered to every American by last Wednesday

11:48.908 --> 11:51.911
but only 1/5th of the country has received their parcel

11:52.011 --> 11:53.546
as the US Postal Service

11:53.612 --> 11:57.116
is overwhelmed by this unprecedented situation.

11:57.216 --> 11:58.417
There's an air of mystery

11:58.517 --> 12:00.453
around the purpose of this stunt,

12:00.553 --> 12:02.955
though Quinn did release this video yesterday.

12:03.055 --> 12:06.125
- If there's a light coming out of your box,

12:06.225 --> 12:08.928
you've been chosen to be a pioneer

12:09.028 --> 12:10.096
who's gonna take us all

12:10.196 --> 12:14.133
into a new dawn of human evolution.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.768
Geez, you're gonna want this.

12:15.868 --> 12:17.870
As of today, only two boxes

12:17.937 --> 12:19.572
have emitted a shining light,

12:19.638 --> 12:23.109
one belonging to fitness personality Dogey Dodge,

12:23.209 --> 12:26.612
the other to beauty and cosplay influencer Pepper Southerland.

12:26.712 --> 12:28.380
Which begs the question,

12:28.447 --> 12:30.282
is this truly a random selection

12:30.382 --> 12:33.319
or are the people being selected social media famous?

12:33.419 --> 12:34.320
- They want me.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.323
I don't know what it is but they want me!

12:37.423 --> 12:39.458
- Meanwhile, millions of Americans

12:39.558 --> 12:41.227
expressed disappointment

12:41.293 --> 12:45.331
as they open their boxes to see nothing but a black void.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.566
And I can say from personal experience,

12:47.633 --> 12:51.904
it is quite hurtful to open that empty box.

12:59.078 --> 13:01.247
- Oh, my God!

13:01.313 --> 13:03.749
Is that Dr. Richie Thinky?

13:03.816 --> 13:05.251
I'm such a fan of yours.

13:05.317 --> 13:07.953
I was so stoked when I saw that you got picked.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.656
My nephews are obsessed with your science experiments.

13:10.756 --> 13:11.957
- Aw! - We that whole, like,

13:12.024 --> 13:13.859
baking soda volcano thing that you do

13:13.959 --> 13:14.860
in my living room.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.495
- The Big Kaboomer? - Yeah, yeah.

13:16.595 --> 13:18.330
- Wow, that must have been messy.

13:18.430 --> 13:19.665
- Ugh!

13:19.765 --> 13:21.834
- I'm so excited to meet you, Elodie on Wheels.

13:21.934 --> 13:24.436
I'm a huge fan of yours! - Shut up!

13:24.503 --> 13:26.939
- Is it her?

13:27.006 --> 13:29.041
Is it really her? - Oh, no!

13:29.141 --> 13:30.509
You daft little piggy!

13:30.609 --> 13:33.612
Where in the fuck have you been?

13:33.679 --> 13:34.814
- The last time I saw you,

13:34.880 --> 13:36.048
I was literally holding your hair back

13:36.148 --> 13:37.483
while you were seriously blowing chunks

13:37.550 --> 13:39.318
into Angela Merkel's Louis Vuitton clutch

13:39.385 --> 13:41.287
at her disco-themed wedding in the Black Forest!

13:41.353 --> 13:44.657
- Oh, no. Take it back. Say it's not true!

13:44.723 --> 13:45.825
- Oh, my God.

13:45.891 --> 13:48.661
Was she so mad? - Are you kidding me?

13:48.727 --> 13:50.830
This is literally the Duchess of Bellhead.

13:50.896 --> 13:52.064
No one's allowed to be mad at her.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.165
- That's so fun.

13:53.232 --> 13:55.000
Are you both duchesses?

13:55.067 --> 13:57.736
- No, I'm PeoplePlacesMarty.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.071
I basically do, like, the most badass stuff

13:59.171 --> 14:00.206
with, like, the most badass people

14:00.306 --> 14:02.975
on the most badass planet in the entire solar system.

14:03.042 --> 14:05.244
Are you PepperPaintsHerself?

14:05.344 --> 14:06.645
- Yeah, I am.

14:06.712 --> 14:07.913
And I'm dressed like a dragon today

14:08.013 --> 14:10.549
'cause I'm having heartburn and it feels like fire.

14:10.649 --> 14:12.818
- And then I, like, almost wiped.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.053
- I just want to butt in and say

14:14.153 --> 14:17.590
that I'm getting really strong energy from both of you.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.858
Are you both water signs?

14:18.924 --> 14:20.426
- Yes! - Yes.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.094
- Yeah, be careful this week, okay?

14:22.194 --> 14:24.430
A lot is being asked for you, so don't get too fluid.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.599
- Okay. Thank you.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.034
And I trust anything that you say

14:29.101 --> 14:31.937
because I am a huge fan of your weekly readings.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.606
- Yeah. Do me a favor, okay?

14:33.706 --> 14:37.042
Don't give me feedback unless I specifically ask for it.

14:37.109 --> 14:38.377
- Kay. - Hey, did you guys

14:38.444 --> 14:40.846
have to fill out a shitload of paperwork for this?

14:40.913 --> 14:44.116
Like, why do they need so much of our medical history?

14:44.216 --> 14:45.384
I'm starting to get pissed that

14:45.451 --> 14:47.953
I don't know a single thing about this.

14:48.053 --> 14:51.190
- Hello. Ah, there you all are!

14:51.257 --> 14:52.925
Oh, wow, you're all glowing.

14:53.025 --> 14:55.928
Why don't you all take a seat? Please. Get comfortable.

14:56.028 --> 14:58.764
I want to welcome all of you.

14:58.864 --> 15:01.300
Hi. Hi, hi, hi.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.802
Okay. Well, I'm Dory Sief.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.372
And I am the cofounder of Lyte.

15:06.438 --> 15:07.873
And these are my amazing partners.

15:07.940 --> 15:09.141
You guys want to introduce yourselves?

15:09.241 --> 15:11.777
- Hi, you guys. I'm Portia Davenport.

15:11.877 --> 15:13.245
I am so excited by this!

15:13.312 --> 15:15.247
This is gonna be so fun and amazing.

15:15.314 --> 15:18.284
And I'm here if you guys have any questions at all. Yay!

15:18.384 --> 15:20.286
- Hi, I'm Drew Gardner.

15:20.386 --> 15:22.254
Um, I want to thank you all for coming.

15:22.321 --> 15:24.290
And yeah, same. So if you have any questions,

15:24.390 --> 15:26.158
feel free to just shoot 'em my way.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.559
- Um, I'm Elliott Goss.

15:27.626 --> 15:29.628
It's so incredible to meet you guys.

15:29.728 --> 15:33.766
And yeah, if you have-- if you have any questions,

15:33.832 --> 15:36.302
you can come to me.

15:36.402 --> 15:37.569
Yes, the dragon.

15:37.636 --> 15:40.839
- Yeah, I guess just, like, what is this?

15:40.940 --> 15:44.777
- Well, you've all been chosen to participate

15:44.843 --> 15:50.015
in the single most important experiment of all time.

15:50.115 --> 15:54.253
We've been developing a remedy for anguish and ignorance

15:54.320 --> 15:56.455
that is going to enhance

15:56.522 --> 15:58.991
the collective human experience.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.260
And we can't do it without you.

16:01.327 --> 16:04.129
You've been selected to be the first pioneers

16:04.196 --> 16:08.033
to embark on the quest for enlightenment.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.202
- Wait! What?

16:10.302 --> 16:13.005
- Oh, hell, yes.

16:13.105 --> 16:14.106
- I just wanted to give you a little taste

16:14.173 --> 16:15.107
of what I'm talking about.

16:15.174 --> 16:16.709
So does anybody want to volunteer

16:16.809 --> 16:18.043
and be my little guinea pig?

16:18.143 --> 16:19.678
- Oh, I will.

16:19.778 --> 16:21.113
- Yes, Elodie. Why don't you come up here

16:21.180 --> 16:23.482
and join me, sweetie.

16:23.549 --> 16:26.785
- Oh, God. Okay. - Sorry, sorry, sorry.

16:26.852 --> 16:28.387
- I actually think I hate all of them.

16:28.487 --> 16:29.521
- How many years do you think

16:29.621 --> 16:30.856
we're gonna have to know these people?

16:30.956 --> 16:32.324
- Even more reason to make the pill

16:32.391 --> 16:33.959
so we can just fix them all.

16:34.026 --> 16:36.028
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.

16:36.128 --> 16:38.397
- So what do you want to work on today?

16:38.497 --> 16:39.698
- What do you mean?

16:39.798 --> 16:43.902
- Is there a part of you that feels unaligned in your life?

16:44.003 --> 16:46.972
Anything you want to fix? Anything at all?

16:47.039 --> 16:50.476
- Oh, gosh. Where do I start?

16:50.542 --> 16:53.379
Um, I guess,

16:53.479 --> 16:55.080
well, I could use a boyfriend.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.349
- Mmm. - Ooh.

16:57.416 --> 17:01.353
- Great. So what would a boyfriend do for you?

17:01.420 --> 17:03.255
- Get me laid.

17:05.657 --> 17:07.493
- Sexual connection. Good.

17:07.559 --> 17:09.495
What else?

17:10.362 --> 17:12.031
- I--I--well,

17:12.097 --> 17:15.834
I guess I've always been a romantic.

17:15.901 --> 17:19.571
I've always just felt like happiest when I'm in love.

17:19.671 --> 17:21.440
- Hmm.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.610
Can I say something that might not make any sense to you?

17:24.710 --> 17:26.879
- Sure.

17:26.945 --> 17:28.614
- You don't want a boyfriend.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.884
- Hmm.

17:31.950 --> 17:34.119
Mmm.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.422
I do though.

17:36.522 --> 17:38.957
- Consciously, you do.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.727
But when every part of us truly wants something...

17:41.794 --> 17:42.795
- Mm-hmm.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.465
- We can manifest it like that.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.268
So the fact that you're sitting up here and you're telling me

17:49.368 --> 17:51.470
that you want a boyfriend but you don't have one,

17:51.570 --> 17:53.972
it tells me that there's some part of you

17:54.073 --> 17:56.308
somewhere that just isn't completely on board.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.309
- Mm-hmm.

17:57.409 --> 18:01.280
- You're not listening to every part of Elodie.

18:01.380 --> 18:04.049
Would you like to hear what she has to say?

18:04.116 --> 18:06.485
- Yes, yes. What does she say?

18:06.585 --> 18:10.322
- Okay. Well, I'm going to embody Elodie,

18:10.422 --> 18:12.825
so that you two can have a conversation.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.493
How does that sound?

18:14.593 --> 18:16.462
- Trippy.

18:16.562 --> 18:17.463
- Okay.

18:17.563 --> 18:18.664
Why don't you give me your hand, sweetie?

18:18.764 --> 18:20.499
- Okay.

18:36.748 --> 18:39.251
- I think if you get into a relationship,

18:39.318 --> 18:43.355
you're gonna mess it up like you always do.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.491
You're gonna scare him away

18:45.591 --> 18:49.461
because he's gonna realize how pathetic you really are.

18:49.528 --> 18:52.498
You're unrealized and superficial.

18:52.598 --> 18:55.467
And roller skating is not a point of view.

18:55.534 --> 18:58.036
- Is she really channeling right now?

18:58.137 --> 18:59.771
- Every time you get into a relationship,

18:59.838 --> 19:02.107
you get ignored or rejected all over again.

19:02.174 --> 19:04.109
- - So I'm going to reject

19:04.176 --> 19:06.211
every man that comes my way

19:06.311 --> 19:09.181
before he has a chance to reject me!

19:14.219 --> 19:15.487
- So what now?

19:15.554 --> 19:17.689
- You have to convince me

19:17.789 --> 19:19.725
that you're worthy.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.661
Otherwise, you are going to die alone.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.736
Ooh.

19:38.043 --> 19:40.512
Do you see what happened there?

19:40.579 --> 19:43.582
We got in touch with the part of Elodie

19:43.682 --> 19:45.584
that is in resistance.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.853
You won't acknowledge her power over you.

19:50.222 --> 19:51.657
- Thank you, Elodie. Why don't you take a seat?

19:54.526 --> 19:57.930
- That was amazing.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.932
- So here at Lyte,

20:00.032 --> 20:02.534
what we're trying to do is heal the wounds

20:02.601 --> 20:04.102
that put us in resistance

20:04.203 --> 20:06.905
with the things that we need.

20:07.005 --> 20:08.240
That was the first step

20:08.340 --> 20:09.875
towards healing that particular trauma

20:09.942 --> 20:12.177
because you weren't born with that trauma.

20:12.244 --> 20:15.614
Something happened in your life that fractured you.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.116
We have hundreds of fractures.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.618
It's overwhelming, isn't it?

20:19.718 --> 20:21.119
- Yeah.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.554
- But here's the good news.

20:22.621 --> 20:25.958
We are going to fix all of that.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.061
And we're gonna do it with a small private group.

20:29.127 --> 20:34.366
Just you all, me, Portia, Drew, Elliott,

20:34.433 --> 20:37.269
and some of the most well regarded scientists

20:37.369 --> 20:39.104
working in our time.

20:39.204 --> 20:40.472
I mean--I mean, how does that sound?

20:40.572 --> 20:43.308
- Awesome. - Whoo!

20:43.408 --> 20:45.978
- Normally, it would take a lifetime

20:46.078 --> 20:49.214
to heal all of these wounds.

20:49.281 --> 20:52.751
But we are developing a pill

20:52.818 --> 20:55.787
that is 100% backed by science

20:55.887 --> 20:57.322
that is going to integrate

20:57.422 --> 20:59.558
all the tiny broken pieces of your souls

20:59.625 --> 21:00.959
in one fell swoop.

21:01.059 --> 21:03.295
- And with all due respect, if she can enlighten you guys,

21:03.395 --> 21:04.496
she can enlighten anyone.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.331
- I need this.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.799
I have a lot of issues.

21:07.899 --> 21:11.003
- This is so messed up.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.138
- Do you want to share your thoughts with us, Dogey?

21:13.238 --> 21:16.174
- Yeah. I just have a problem with what I just saw.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.743
You didn't become a part of her.

21:17.809 --> 21:19.311
You bullied that girl.

21:19.411 --> 21:23.348
I don't like this one bit.

21:23.448 --> 21:27.352
- Is that because maybe you're afraid to do this work?

21:27.452 --> 21:28.453
- Um, no.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.422
I think it's just all bullshit.

21:30.489 --> 21:34.159
- Nah, man, expand your mind. This shit is real.

21:34.259 --> 21:36.862
Ugh, I can't even with how low you vibrate.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.930
- Hey, it's okay.

21:38.997 --> 21:40.966
He just has a choice to make.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.701
Do you want to work on yourself

21:42.801 --> 21:46.371
and bettering the lives of everyone in the world

21:46.471 --> 21:48.874
or do you want to leave?

21:48.974 --> 21:50.342
There's a great restaurant right next door

21:50.442 --> 21:52.944
if you want to grab a bite on your way home.

21:53.011 --> 21:55.213
- Wow.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.684
Fuck you. Fuck all of this.

21:58.784 --> 22:00.385
I'm Catholic.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.356
- He's famously closeted.

22:04.456 --> 22:06.358
- Oh, okay. - Is there anyone else

22:06.458 --> 22:08.293
who is having doubts about this?

22:08.360 --> 22:11.563
Because this is not something to take lightly.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.665
This is a huge responsibility.

22:13.732 --> 22:18.403
And you will be dedicating 100% of your lives to this cause.

22:18.503 --> 22:20.238
People may not understand.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.973
Family and partners,

22:22.040 --> 22:23.809
they may question you about this.

22:23.875 --> 22:25.811
But that should embolden you

22:25.877 --> 22:27.312
because that tells you that their love

22:27.379 --> 22:30.248
has always been conditional.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.250
That's an unfortunate truth

22:32.351 --> 22:35.053
because even our parents withhold love from us

22:35.153 --> 22:39.358
when we don't turn out how they envisioned.

22:39.424 --> 22:44.096
But we will become a family together

22:44.196 --> 22:49.267
in our pursuit for unconditional love.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.104
We are voyagers

22:52.204 --> 22:55.540
of true love

22:55.607 --> 22:58.877
for the betterment of humanity.

22:58.944 --> 23:03.081
And if that is not something that you are interested in,

23:03.181 --> 23:04.616
then you're free to leave.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.556
- I'm with you.

23:12.791 --> 23:15.360
- Me too.

23:15.427 --> 23:16.928
- Same.

23:17.028 --> 23:18.730
- I'm in. - Yeah.

23:18.797 --> 23:20.599
I mean, we have to.

23:20.699 --> 23:22.267
- Let's do this!

23:39.317 --> 23:41.153
- Thank you.

23:41.253 --> 23:44.790
Thank you. Thank you.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.057
This is a day

23:46.124 --> 23:49.728
that I've been looking forward to my entire life.

23:49.795 --> 23:50.829
I just didn't know it.

23:56.635 --> 23:57.669
Every now and again,

23:57.769 --> 24:00.138
an innovation comes along

24:00.238 --> 24:03.074
that changes everything.

24:03.141 --> 24:06.645
I've been lucky to be at the helm of several of these.

24:06.745 --> 24:08.814
In 1992,

24:08.914 --> 24:11.450
I envisioned a world where people could

24:11.516 --> 24:14.619
send messages back and forth at the speed of light,

24:14.686 --> 24:19.191
allowing everybody to easefully make plans with each other.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.959
I called it texting.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.362
- We love texting!

24:24.463 --> 24:27.666
- And now I bring you

24:27.766 --> 24:29.501
the greatest breakthrough

24:29.601 --> 24:31.770
in the history of our species,

24:31.837 --> 24:34.506
universal enlightenment.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.543
That's right. And to explain it,

24:38.643 --> 24:42.147
I'd like to introduce my friend and business partner.

24:42.214 --> 24:45.650
Together, we've been working on a formula

24:45.717 --> 24:48.987
to change the world.

24:49.054 --> 24:50.989
Dory Sief.

24:51.056 --> 24:53.124
- Yeah, Dory!

25:05.303 --> 25:07.572
- Okay. So I don't get a kiss?

25:16.248 --> 25:18.383
- Hmm.

25:18.483 --> 25:22.087
I believe.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.756
I believe that humankind

25:24.856 --> 25:28.360
can not only know love

25:28.426 --> 25:30.428
but be love.

25:30.529 --> 25:34.733
That we are intended to transcend consciousness

25:34.833 --> 25:36.234
to survive.

25:36.334 --> 25:38.169
Since the dawn of time,

25:38.236 --> 25:39.771
we have pined for an era

25:39.871 --> 25:44.175
where we reconcile the dilemma of who we are

25:44.242 --> 25:46.411
and why we are here

25:46.511 --> 25:48.747
and transmute ourselves

25:48.847 --> 25:52.117
into absolute peace.

25:52.217 --> 25:55.453
We are evolving.

25:55.554 --> 25:58.256
- And we're so thrilled to present

25:58.356 --> 26:01.960
the very first to evolve.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.629
These six test subjects were chosen

26:04.729 --> 26:07.599
from amongst 210 million Americans

26:07.699 --> 26:13.305
and asked to redirect their online presence

26:13.405 --> 26:16.708
with a new focus

26:16.775 --> 26:18.109
on the quest for enlightenment.

26:18.209 --> 26:21.413
These pioneers are gonna be the first people on the planet

26:21.479 --> 26:23.982
to take the pill

26:24.082 --> 26:28.486
that's gonna bring about a revolution of love.

26:28.587 --> 26:32.324
- And now may I introduce my disciples.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.726
- Whoo! - Whoo!

26:36.328 --> 26:40.332
- First up, Leonora Hamsdale.

26:43.635 --> 26:46.137
Red Lyte!

26:54.346 --> 26:55.847
Marty Plushfeld!

26:59.150 --> 27:00.251
Orange Lyte!

27:08.793 --> 27:10.595
Winnie Miranda!

27:14.366 --> 27:15.867
Yellow Lyte!

27:23.508 --> 27:25.477
Pepper Southerland!

27:29.114 --> 27:31.049
Green Lyte!

27:40.025 --> 27:41.559
Ritchie Thinky!

27:45.497 --> 27:47.032
Blue Lyte!

27:54.739 --> 27:56.408
Yeah!

27:56.508 --> 27:58.677
And Elodie Revlon!

28:01.746 --> 28:03.081
Violet Lyte!

28:05.016 --> 28:07.085
Yeah! Whoo!

28:10.655 --> 28:12.891
Yeah!

28:50.628 --> 28:52.731
- Hey. You okay?

28:52.797 --> 28:56.034
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm doing fine.
