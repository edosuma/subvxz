WEBVTT

00:03.192 --> 00:05.710
Mandy, you're getting
glitter on my soccer ball.

00:05.745 --> 00:08.063
Oh, well, now it's a disco ball.
You're welcome!

00:09.565 --> 00:11.900
Oh, look. Boyd drew a rocket...

00:11.934 --> 00:15.103
Or a... wiener. You know what?
Let's go with rocket.

00:17.306 --> 00:18.857
Oh! Your dad's home!

00:18.891 --> 00:22.110
Oh, finally. I've been cooped
up with you hens long enough.

00:22.128 --> 00:24.162
Oh, Eve, honey, it's not
cute when your dad says it,

00:24.213 --> 00:27.749
and it's just... confusing when you do it.

00:27.783 --> 00:29.517
<i>Where was his catalog shoot this time?</i>

00:29.552 --> 00:31.953
Peru? Portugal? Something with a "p."

00:31.988 --> 00:34.055
Yeah, Alaska, with a "p."

00:35.641 --> 00:37.809
He said he was bringing dinner home.

00:37.843 --> 00:39.294
<i>Oh, good. We're starving.</i>

00:39.328 --> 00:42.063
I'm back!

00:42.098 --> 00:43.398
Ah.

00:43.432 --> 00:45.734
All right, dinner.

00:45.768 --> 00:48.103
Oh!

00:48.137 --> 00:50.572
<i>What am I supposed to do with this?</i>

00:50.606 --> 00:52.407
You slice it, mouth to anus.

00:52.441 --> 00:55.110
You pull everything out.
Pretty self-explanatory.

00:58.814 --> 01:00.832
I gotta grab a shower. Mmm. Yeah.

01:00.866 --> 01:04.786
<i>It is great to be back home.</i>

01:10.292 --> 01:12.927
Wow. You're heading to work kinda early.

01:12.962 --> 01:14.662
By the sun's position,
I'd have it at--

01:14.680 --> 01:16.631
yeah. You wanna just look at a clock?

01:19.001 --> 01:21.803
Ugh, the boss wants
to see me. I'm worried.

01:21.837 --> 01:23.521
Even though I've been there almost a year,

01:23.556 --> 01:25.473
I'm still the new chick.

01:25.507 --> 01:27.508
That's good. New chick's always hot.

01:27.526 --> 01:29.194
Look, I could use some help.

01:29.228 --> 01:31.279
How long are you home for this time?

01:31.313 --> 01:33.381
Oh, probably seven days,

01:33.416 --> 01:35.950
then we're off to Costa Rica
shooting our spring catalog.

01:35.985 --> 01:38.119
What do you need? Can
you drive Eve to soccer?

01:38.154 --> 01:40.955
<i>Soccer. That's just Europe's covert war</i>

01:40.990 --> 01:44.492
for the hearts and
minds of America's kids.

01:44.527 --> 01:46.327
We're scrimmaging the
boys to make us tougher.

01:46.362 --> 01:48.663
Well, the boys aren't that
tough. I've seen them play.

01:48.697 --> 01:50.548
Running around, getting
hair gel in their eyes,

01:50.583 --> 01:53.501
<i>run in the goalpost, and
they cry.</i>

01:53.536 --> 01:57.138
Why are you watching the
young boys play soccer?

01:57.173 --> 02:00.041
I'm pretty sure I just explained why.

02:01.543 --> 02:02.761
Morning. Morning.

02:02.812 --> 02:05.547
Hey. Hey, mom, can you
take Boyd to day care?

02:05.581 --> 02:08.348
I can't be late to the diner.

02:08.383 --> 02:09.883
It's our "salute to bacon"
week, and I'm the only person

02:09.919 --> 02:11.986
who knows how to work the defibrillator.

02:12.021 --> 02:14.055
I'm running late. Ask your dad.

02:14.073 --> 02:15.990
Oh, not dad. Boyd only
knows, like, six words,

02:16.025 --> 02:17.075
and half of them are...

02:17.109 --> 02:19.227
"I blame Obamacare!"

02:20.613 --> 02:22.563
He's a bad influence.

02:22.581 --> 02:24.065
You know, he's standing right here.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.700
He does his best.

02:25.734 --> 02:28.503
<i>Literally, I'm standing right here.</i>

02:28.537 --> 02:30.605
<i>You know who should take Boyd to day care?</i>

02:30.639 --> 02:33.124
Is that deadbeat, no-good father of his.

02:33.175 --> 02:35.260
Yeah, dad. We've been over this, really.

02:35.294 --> 02:36.678
I'm doing fine.

02:36.712 --> 02:38.079
I know this might be
hard for you to believe

02:38.097 --> 02:40.281
because you're so old school,
but I do not need a man.

02:40.316 --> 02:42.884
Well, you got a baby,
so you needed a man once.

02:45.421 --> 02:47.689
Ew!

02:47.723 --> 02:50.475
All right, I will take Boyd to day care,

02:50.526 --> 02:51.926
but I just hope my being late

02:51.944 --> 02:54.429
does not cause the
great bacon riot of 2011.

02:54.463 --> 02:57.065
I like bacon.

02:58.367 --> 03:00.368
You need to lay off
Kristin. She won't admit it,

03:00.402 --> 03:02.070
but she's having a tough time.

03:02.104 --> 03:03.371
People have been having a tough time

03:03.405 --> 03:05.073
since the beginning of time.

03:05.107 --> 03:06.875
You know what's the matter
with the world these days?

03:06.909 --> 03:09.844
Sure. Let's discuss that.

03:11.413 --> 03:12.881
Love you.

03:12.915 --> 03:14.549
Have a good day at work. I love you.

03:14.583 --> 03:16.050
Bye.

03:21.023 --> 03:22.123
Now what's wrong?

03:22.158 --> 03:25.226
Dad, no. It's gonna be boring.

03:25.261 --> 03:27.478
I just... I
really needed mom's advice.

03:27.513 --> 03:29.848
Well, I'm here. You can have dad's advice.

03:29.899 --> 03:31.599
No, I need good advice.

03:32.935 --> 03:34.185
I gave your older sister plenty of advice

03:34.236 --> 03:35.737
when she was a teenager. What's up?

03:35.771 --> 03:36.971
Oh, yeah, is that when she got the tattoo

03:37.006 --> 03:39.007
or when she came home
from her prom pregnant?

03:39.041 --> 03:41.843
She has a tattoo?

03:41.877 --> 03:44.012
I think it's called a tramp stamp.

03:44.046 --> 03:46.247
Yeah, thank God. She
doesn't have a tattoo.

03:46.282 --> 03:48.499
She has a-a tramp stamp.

03:50.119 --> 03:51.336
What's the matter?
I'm saying--

03:51.370 --> 03:52.537
no! You're just gonna say it's stupid.

03:52.588 --> 03:54.756
Come on. Give me a break. I'm your dad.

03:54.790 --> 03:56.191
What's--what's
going on?

03:58.194 --> 04:00.595
Travis said that "Glee" is dumb.

04:00.629 --> 04:02.931
For crap's sake. Is
that what's worrying you?

04:02.965 --> 04:05.216
Is that why you're crying?

04:10.356 --> 04:11.839
What's "Glee"?

04:13.525 --> 04:16.511
Hey, guys, great to be
back in the sanctuary.

04:16.545 --> 04:20.982
Yeah. No hair dryers, no
tears, no citrus body wash.

04:21.016 --> 04:24.285
It smells like balls in here.

04:27.423 --> 04:29.457
Who are you?

04:29.491 --> 04:31.209
I'm Kyle.

04:31.243 --> 04:33.211
You hired me a couple of months ago.

04:33.245 --> 04:35.529
I parked in your spot, and
you broke my windshield.

04:35.547 --> 04:37.715
It's Kyle.
How's it going, buddy?

04:37.750 --> 04:38.800
Hi.

04:38.834 --> 04:40.534
Kyle. I like the name "Kyle."

04:40.552 --> 04:43.304
That's a man's name,
guys-- Kyle. "K." Kyle.

04:43.339 --> 04:45.306
"I'm-here-to-kick-
some-crap-Kyle."

04:45.341 --> 04:47.375
Actually, Kyle's my mother's maiden name.

04:47.409 --> 04:49.310
Didn't need to know that, Kyle.

04:50.946 --> 04:52.347
Oh.

04:52.381 --> 04:54.015
Welcome home, Mikey.

04:54.049 --> 04:56.217
Hey, buddy.

04:56.235 --> 04:57.435
How are you? Good.

04:57.486 --> 04:59.354
Did you bring me back
something from Alaska?

04:59.388 --> 05:01.322
Hmm? What are you, 3?

05:06.561 --> 05:08.079
Oh, good.

05:08.113 --> 05:10.698
I didn't have one of these guys.
Ah, yeah, yeah.

05:10.732 --> 05:12.967
All right, look, I'm, uh,

05:13.002 --> 05:14.902
I'm not gonna beat around
the bush here.

05:14.937 --> 05:17.939
Just got a call from corporate
today.

05:17.973 --> 05:19.874
They wanna shut down the catalog.

05:19.908 --> 05:22.510
Corporate? You own the company.

05:22.544 --> 05:24.345
It was worth a shot. What the hell.

05:24.380 --> 05:26.014
What are you talking about?

05:26.048 --> 05:27.949
Our catalog was voted "best catalog"

05:27.983 --> 05:30.268
by "catalogs magazine."

05:30.302 --> 05:31.719
Catalog is done.

05:31.753 --> 05:32.753
What, are you gonna phase it out?

05:32.771 --> 05:34.088
Consider it phased.

05:34.106 --> 05:35.623
After Costa Rica, we're done?

05:35.658 --> 05:37.625
No Costa, no Rica. You're grounded.

05:37.660 --> 05:41.029
<i>But I need your expertise on the web site.</i>

05:41.063 --> 05:42.297
The web site's terrible.

05:42.331 --> 05:43.798
Oh, that's why I want you in charge of it.

05:43.832 --> 05:45.733
For us to have any future at all,

05:45.768 --> 05:48.136
we have to lure young men to our stuff.

05:48.170 --> 05:51.572
Now you talk like my sisters talking.

05:51.607 --> 05:55.410
Young people don't read catalogs anymore.

05:55.444 --> 05:58.629
They're online, so your job
now is you gotta go get 'em.

05:58.664 --> 06:00.832
I need this company to be
viable a hundred years from now

06:00.883 --> 06:02.617
so I'll have a place to come back to

06:02.651 --> 06:04.952
when they unfreeze my head.

06:04.987 --> 06:08.156
Why don't we just hire
a young Internet geek

06:08.190 --> 06:09.490
to improve the web site?

06:09.525 --> 06:12.060
Well, I could do that,
then what would you do?

06:12.094 --> 06:13.928
I can't believe you're grounding me.

06:13.962 --> 06:15.063
I'll make a deal.

06:15.097 --> 06:17.065
You find a way to increase our web sales,

06:17.099 --> 06:18.666
I'll find a way of putting
you back on the road.

06:18.701 --> 06:20.668
Is that a deal?

06:20.703 --> 06:22.737
It's a deal. Now scram.

06:24.506 --> 06:26.174
What, you have time to
go to the range today?

06:26.208 --> 06:29.977
No, some jack-wang is parked in my spot.

06:34.729 --> 06:35.829
Guess what?

06:35.863 --> 06:38.798
I was offered a huge promotion at work.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.483
Congratulations. Yeah.

06:40.518 --> 06:42.836
But if I take it, it
would be longer hours,

06:42.870 --> 06:44.137
and that would mean

06:44.171 --> 06:46.039
you'd have to step up
around here with the girls.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.841
That's great.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.243
But how can I work longer hours

06:50.277 --> 06:51.911
if you're always gone?

06:51.946 --> 06:53.880
M-maybe I-I
won't go so much.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.215
Oh, well, that's sweet.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.216
Yeah.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.051
- What happened? 
- Nothing.

06:58.085 --> 07:01.187
You know, just maybe I wanna
spend more time with the girls.

07:01.222 --> 07:02.555
What happened?

07:02.590 --> 07:04.724
Ohh. Ed's grounding me

07:04.759 --> 07:07.844
until I can increase our
company's web presence.

07:07.878 --> 07:11.030
Well, you should
talk to Mandy about her Vlog.

07:11.065 --> 07:12.265
Vlog? Yeah.

07:12.299 --> 07:13.767
Is that slang for something bad?

07:13.801 --> 07:17.203
Like what?

07:17.238 --> 07:18.571
I don't know. I
have a-- when I move,

07:18.606 --> 07:20.390
sometimes my Vlog hits...

07:20.441 --> 07:22.675
Hits...

07:22.710 --> 07:25.812
Sorry I'm late for dinner!
Travis and I got a flat tire,

07:25.846 --> 07:28.364
and it took forever for
triple "a" to get there.

07:28.399 --> 07:30.349
Wait. Don't tell me

07:30.367 --> 07:33.352
you called a strange
person to change your tire.

07:33.370 --> 07:36.623
Then why did you give
me an auto club card?

07:36.657 --> 07:38.224
That's for a real emergency,

07:38.259 --> 07:41.461
like a meteor hitting
the car or something.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.129
Wh-where is Travis?

07:43.164 --> 07:44.164
Uh, he went to the tanning salon.

07:44.198 --> 07:47.133
Ohh! Ugh!

07:47.168 --> 07:51.721
Ow! That actually hurts to hear that.

07:51.755 --> 07:53.940
Honey, I-I don't think
you're ever gonna be able

07:53.974 --> 07:57.110
to rely on this guy Travis,
and I'm also gonna ground you

07:57.144 --> 07:58.978
till you can figure out
how to change a tire.

07:59.013 --> 08:00.379
That's so unfair!

08:00.397 --> 08:03.316
Who ever said life was
supposed to be fair?

08:03.350 --> 08:05.985
I'm just doing this so you
don't have to depend on a man.

08:06.020 --> 08:07.053
Um, I thought your argument with me

08:07.087 --> 08:09.155
<i>was that I needed a man.</i>

08:09.190 --> 08:15.061
Just concern yourself
with this area over here.

08:18.532 --> 08:19.699
- How's work?
- Yeah.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.568
Oh, they're adding
all-you-can-eat sausage

08:21.602 --> 08:22.836
to the mix tomorrow.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.472
It's gonna be mayhem.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.640
Mm. I love sausage.

08:29.777 --> 08:32.212
Your dad can drive Boyd to day care.

08:32.246 --> 08:34.429
There's no car seat in the truck.
There's no car seat in the truck.

08:34.465 --> 08:36.582
Well, I will take the truck.
You can take the minivan.

08:38.953 --> 08:41.888
<i>You'll take the truck.
I'll drive the minivan.</i>

08:41.922 --> 08:43.456
You're not kidding right now, are you?

08:43.491 --> 08:45.608
No, I'm not.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.428
<i>Well, aloha.</i>

08:49.446 --> 08:51.364
Sure. All right.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.699
All right, champ.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.617
You have a great day
at day care, all right?

08:54.652 --> 08:56.435
Oh, we don't--we don't
use terms like that here.

08:56.453 --> 08:59.606
See, "champ" implies
victory over another person.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.908
Right, and you're all winners here.

09:01.942 --> 09:04.160
Now you're getting it. Hey, come on in.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.546
Ruby's two dads are here,
and they're making muffins--

09:06.580 --> 09:08.515
flax and pumpkin.

09:08.549 --> 09:11.150
Please tell me that's not their names.

09:11.185 --> 09:13.219
That's a good one. Take the shoes off.

09:13.254 --> 09:15.388
We're building a mosque out of pillows.

09:15.422 --> 09:17.156
Give me the kid back.

09:18.559 --> 09:21.127
Everything you need to know about life

09:21.145 --> 09:22.345
you can learn from hanging with grandpa.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.796
You just stick with me, all right?

09:23.831 --> 09:26.015
Kyle, take the baby, will ya?

09:26.066 --> 09:27.183
Yeah.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.235
Here you go. Whew. You'll need this.

09:29.270 --> 09:31.437
Dropped a bomb.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.181
<i>So as you know, I normally
broadcast from Mandyland.</i>

09:42.216 --> 09:44.717
<i>But tonight I'm transmitting
from cell block "c"</i>

09:44.752 --> 09:46.719
<i>of dad-ica prison.</i>

09:46.754 --> 09:48.187
<i>Da-dica?</i>

09:48.222 --> 09:51.257
<i>â™ª Dad, oh,
da-a-a-a-ad â™ª</i>

09:51.292 --> 09:55.929
<i>â™ª Travis went to gaga,
can't you see I'm sad? â™ª</i>

09:55.963 --> 09:58.381
Ugh! Ahh!

09:58.432 --> 10:01.901
5,000 followers? People got a lot
of time on their hands.

10:01.936 --> 10:04.938
Hey, Kyle! Didn't I ask
you to take care of the kid?

10:04.972 --> 10:07.574
<i>Yeah, Ed's pulling him around
the parking lot. He's what?</i>

10:07.608 --> 10:10.509
In a kayak. Oh.

10:12.046 --> 10:15.181
Kyle.

10:15.199 --> 10:17.584
- Do you know how to change a tire?
- Sure. You need me to change your tire?

10:17.618 --> 10:21.754
- Do I look like the kind of guy that 
can't change his own tire?
- Why are you yelling at me?

10:21.789 --> 10:23.039
I don't know what we're talking about.

10:23.073 --> 10:25.124
Why don't you come over to my house?

10:25.159 --> 10:26.576
I want you to meet my daughter Mandy.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.528
If you like her, maybe
take her out on a date.

10:28.562 --> 10:32.415
If you don't like her,
take her out on a date.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.933
But no funny business.

10:33.968 --> 10:35.234
You mean like sex?

10:35.269 --> 10:38.071
Oh.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.505
You know, it troubles me, Kyle,

10:39.540 --> 10:41.107
that you're so handy with that word.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.877
Just try to remember something.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.045
I could fire you...

10:50.684 --> 10:53.236
Or worse.

10:53.270 --> 10:54.654
Huh?

10:57.550 --> 11:00.202
Dad, where's Boyd?

11:00.236 --> 11:02.888
Uh, he's napping. He got
into the energy bars at work.

11:02.922 --> 11:06.391
He ran around until he passed out.

11:06.426 --> 11:09.027
So... instead of taking him to day care,

11:09.045 --> 11:12.547
you took him to the blow
dart and shotgun emporium?

11:12.582 --> 11:15.333
He wasn't around anything dangerous, okay?

11:15.368 --> 11:16.501
And I can't say the same

11:16.535 --> 11:18.837
had I left him at hippie hippie rainbow.

11:20.072 --> 11:21.840
Bruce teaches sensitivity and tolerance.

11:21.874 --> 11:23.675
I just don't think your kid
should go to that school.

11:23.709 --> 11:25.093
You know how that ends up. Hmm?

11:25.144 --> 11:27.679
Boyd dancing on a float.

11:30.883 --> 11:32.784
And what would be so wrong with that?

11:32.819 --> 11:34.286
The only time men should be dancin'

11:34.320 --> 11:38.223
is when other other men
are shootin' at their feet.

11:38.257 --> 11:40.609
Are you gonna meddle up
until the day you die?

11:40.660 --> 11:43.411
And beyond.

11:43.446 --> 11:46.731
I have a very specific will.

11:49.285 --> 11:53.205
Mandy keeps telling me
soccer's making my legs thick.

11:53.239 --> 11:57.375
Listen, Eve, boys like a
gal with a sturdy foundation.

11:58.911 --> 12:01.246
That's what attracted me to
your mom in the first place.

12:02.515 --> 12:05.300
Don't ever tell her I said that.

12:05.351 --> 12:08.303
I've never played against the boys before.

12:08.354 --> 12:10.055
Are there any cute ones?

12:10.089 --> 12:13.225
No. Who said
anything about Victor Blake?

12:15.895 --> 12:18.313
Let me give you some advice.

12:18.364 --> 12:20.282
You wanna impress the boys, you play hard,

12:20.316 --> 12:21.599
take the game to them,

12:21.617 --> 12:24.469
prove that you belong on that field.

12:24.504 --> 12:26.204
Trust me.

12:27.957 --> 12:30.242
Well, we have to move!

12:31.610 --> 12:32.744
What happened?

12:32.778 --> 12:34.980
Dad! He told me that
boys would like me more

12:35.014 --> 12:37.549
if I played aggressive. I
sprained Victor Blake's ankle,

12:37.583 --> 12:39.651
and now they call me "Queen Kong."

12:41.487 --> 12:43.054
I'm going to pack!

12:43.089 --> 12:44.923
Ugh!

12:47.727 --> 12:49.127
I can explain.

12:50.630 --> 12:52.998
We might have to move.

12:53.065 --> 12:55.466
Why are you giving girl advice?

12:55.484 --> 12:56.685
Why don't you just
stick to what you know--

12:56.736 --> 12:59.654
chasing raccoons out of the yard?

12:59.689 --> 13:02.040
They're a herding animal.

13:02.074 --> 13:03.608
If you don't nip
that in the bud--

13:03.642 --> 13:05.476
oh, I...

13:05.494 --> 13:09.781
I just hate to disappoint her.

13:09.815 --> 13:11.482
Kristin never listens to me anymore,

13:11.500 --> 13:13.985
and Mandy's got her new
family, the Kardashians.

13:15.705 --> 13:18.456
Queen Kong's my little buddy.

13:18.491 --> 13:20.292
Just go up and talk to her.

13:20.326 --> 13:22.527
She's not talking to me.

13:22.562 --> 13:24.329
None of my girls are talking to me.

13:24.347 --> 13:27.299
Usually I think that's a great idea.

13:27.333 --> 13:29.884
Right now it just hurts.

13:29.936 --> 13:33.338
<i>Mike, your girls are talking to you.</i>

13:33.356 --> 13:35.774
You just need to listen to them.

13:38.444 --> 13:39.778
Huh?

13:42.648 --> 13:44.015
Hi. Mike Baxter here,

13:44.050 --> 13:46.084
asking the question
that men have been asking

13:46.118 --> 13:47.652
since medieval times.

13:47.687 --> 13:50.538
Gosh darn it. Where can I get

13:50.573 --> 13:54.125
a crossbow online?

13:54.160 --> 13:57.195
This is the new Excalibur
super saber series.

13:57.229 --> 13:59.230
Composite handle, so when
you're huntin'...

13:59.265 --> 14:00.865
When you're huntin'...

14:00.883 --> 14:03.268
God. Who am I kidding?

14:03.302 --> 14:05.303
If you're watching this...

14:05.338 --> 14:06.771
You don't hunt.

14:06.806 --> 14:08.740
You're probably hunting for
a tissue right about now,

14:08.774 --> 14:10.041
aren't you?

14:10.076 --> 14:12.543
And some girl at a soccer game

14:12.561 --> 14:16.348
where nobody can lose sprained your ankle!

14:16.382 --> 14:17.949
There's a guy named
Jack Youngblood--

14:17.984 --> 14:21.552
<i>played the super bowl with a broken leg!</i>

14:21.570 --> 14:22.887
That's not fantasy!

14:22.922 --> 14:24.923
What the heck is fantasy football?

14:24.957 --> 14:26.524
I got a fantasy.

14:26.559 --> 14:28.259
Why don't you get off the
frickin' couch, you morons?

14:28.327 --> 14:31.363
What happened to men?

14:31.397 --> 14:34.699
Men used to build cities just
so we could burn 'em down.

14:34.734 --> 14:37.969
We got our hair cut by a guy named Hank.

14:38.004 --> 14:39.571
But modern
man--what do you do?

14:39.605 --> 14:42.474
You run from stuff--
responsibility, fatherhood.

14:42.508 --> 14:46.144
You can't even change a tire. A tire!

14:46.178 --> 14:48.179
<i>Why don't you get off
the couch, you moron,</i>

14:48.214 --> 14:50.932
<i>and go outside?!</i>

14:50.966 --> 14:53.601
<i>You'll see something
bright. It's called the sun.</i>

14:53.636 --> 14:55.887
<i>It's like a tanning bed, but it's free!</i>

14:57.923 --> 15:01.526
How is Mike pretending to
be angry, scary, and unstable

15:01.560 --> 15:04.813
good for our web site?

15:04.864 --> 15:08.149
We've gotten tons of hits. Hits are good.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.300
I know hits are good, you jack-wang.

15:09.335 --> 15:12.904
I'm not a thousand years old.

15:12.938 --> 15:14.305
It's gone viral.

15:14.340 --> 15:16.007
Our web traffic is way up.

15:16.042 --> 15:18.476
Well... Looks like this company

15:18.511 --> 15:20.812
has finally entered the 20th century, huh?

15:20.846 --> 15:24.683
But it's the 21st century, sir.

15:24.717 --> 15:26.951
One step at a time, Kyle.

15:30.790 --> 15:32.757
Hey, Eve, would you
give me the ketchup--

15:32.791 --> 15:34.125
not talking to you.

15:34.143 --> 15:35.477
Kristin, does Boyd want a hot dog,

15:35.511 --> 15:38.463
or do you have some soy thing
on a stick in your purse?

15:40.066 --> 15:42.150
Okay, I get it.

15:42.184 --> 15:43.401
Nobody's talking to me.

15:43.436 --> 15:45.603
I'm talking to you, dad.
That makes me nervous.

15:45.637 --> 15:48.373
Yeah. Will you go pick up Travis, please?

15:48.407 --> 15:49.657
You can pick him up. Really?

15:49.692 --> 15:51.609
Yeah, if you can just figure
out how to change a tire.

15:52.661 --> 15:54.145
So sad.

15:54.163 --> 15:57.615
I'm living with Lord Voldemort!

15:57.649 --> 16:00.018
I don't know who that is,

16:00.052 --> 16:04.172
but he sounds like a very caring father.

16:04.206 --> 16:07.959
Hi. You must be Mr. B's daughter.

16:07.993 --> 16:10.395
Okay.

16:10.429 --> 16:11.563
And who are you?

16:11.597 --> 16:14.532
I'm Kyle. Your dad wanted us to meet?

16:14.567 --> 16:17.035
Oh, God. Did he tell
you that I needed a man?

16:17.069 --> 16:19.637
Pretty much.

16:19.671 --> 16:21.856
Great. Well, did he also tell you

16:21.891 --> 16:25.009
that I need help because
I'm a single mom? Um...

16:25.027 --> 16:27.845
I'm guessing not by that
dumbfounded look on your face.

16:27.863 --> 16:31.065
Oh, no, this is just my face.

16:31.117 --> 16:32.650
Okay, why are you hanging out with my dad?

16:32.685 --> 16:34.402
That's just weird. I work for him.

16:34.453 --> 16:37.422
Oh, God. Is he paying you to date me?

16:37.456 --> 16:39.240
Am I that pathetic?

16:39.291 --> 16:40.992
You wanna go to a movie?

16:41.026 --> 16:44.862
Um, a-a movie. Well, I
have not been to a movie

16:44.880 --> 16:47.999
since my water broke during "Avatar."

16:48.033 --> 16:50.668
Hello, Boyd.

16:50.703 --> 16:52.904
Boyd, right. That little dude's awesome.

16:52.938 --> 16:54.172
He really loves your dad.

16:54.206 --> 16:56.674
Yeah, well, Boyd loves everybody.

16:56.709 --> 16:57.876
No, he fell and tripped,

16:57.910 --> 16:59.444
and your dad came over
and hugged him and said,

16:59.478 --> 17:02.380
"hey, it's okay to cry. Just let it out."

17:02.414 --> 17:04.883
Wait. Mr. Outdoor Man said that?

17:04.916 --> 17:06.601
Later on, when a heat
lamp fell on my foot,

17:06.652 --> 17:09.654
was it okay for me to cry? No, it was not.

17:12.324 --> 17:14.192
Oh, o-okay. Um...

17:14.226 --> 17:16.461
I'm--I'm gonna go
and check on Boyd,

17:16.494 --> 17:18.946
and, um... And
you go say hi to my dad,

17:18.998 --> 17:21.115
and then, um, we'll go.

17:21.166 --> 17:22.400
Okay. Okay.

17:27.606 --> 17:29.674
- Hey, Mr. B.
- Hey, Kyle.

17:29.708 --> 17:31.209
Thanks for having me over. You bet, buddy.

17:31.243 --> 17:32.710
Mandy is awesome.

17:32.745 --> 17:34.596
Well, that's great.

17:34.630 --> 17:37.131
Yeah, that is great. Who are you?

17:37.183 --> 17:38.583
I'm Kyle.

17:38.617 --> 17:40.451
I'm sort of Mike's right-hand man.

17:40.486 --> 17:42.720
No, you're not, Kyle.

17:42.754 --> 17:45.923
Hey, dad, thank you for
telling Kyle about me.

17:47.359 --> 17:51.296
It's o-okay, daughter.

17:51.330 --> 17:53.314
Wait, wait. Didn't--didn't
you just say you were here

17:53.365 --> 17:55.266
<i>to see man--
and man.</i>

17:55.284 --> 17:59.954
<i>Man, am I hungry. That's a man.</i>

17:59.989 --> 18:02.991
O-okay. Well, um, we're
gonna go see a movie

18:03.042 --> 18:04.959
- if you could watch Boyd.
- Yeah, sure.

18:04.994 --> 18:08.112
Actually, I was asking dad.

18:08.147 --> 18:11.583
Actually, she was asking me. Okay.

18:11.617 --> 18:14.118
Thank you, dad.

18:14.136 --> 18:15.153
Okay.

18:18.841 --> 18:21.593
Come on, Kyle.

18:21.627 --> 18:24.462
What the hell did you do?

18:26.298 --> 18:27.632
I-I don't know.

18:27.650 --> 18:29.934
Oh, Mr. B. I almost
forgot to tell you. Yeah.

18:29.968 --> 18:31.302
Ed says he's proud of you

18:31.337 --> 18:32.987
and that you're back on for Costa Rica.

18:33.022 --> 18:35.823
Great, great,
great. That-- good.

18:35.858 --> 18:38.309
Let me give you a little hint about Mandy.

18:38.327 --> 18:40.828
She likes to be called "Kristin."

18:40.863 --> 18:42.780
It's a nickname.

18:42.814 --> 18:44.165
Thanks, Mr. B.

18:44.199 --> 18:46.367
You bet.

18:46.418 --> 18:49.654
You know that's not gonna end well.

18:49.688 --> 18:51.289
Yes, I do.

18:51.323 --> 18:53.958
Well, I hope you're happy!

18:53.992 --> 18:55.627
Well, I was for a couple seconds.

18:57.062 --> 18:58.212
What's happening?

18:58.264 --> 18:59.464
I changed a tire. What?

18:59.498 --> 19:01.215
I broke three nails
and I ruined a sweater.

19:01.267 --> 19:04.569
Oh, and you know the--the--
the pumpy, pumpy thing?

19:04.603 --> 19:06.003
- Uh, jack.
- Yeah, jack.

19:06.021 --> 19:08.139
You need a new one.

19:08.173 --> 19:11.025
Uh... I'm proud of you, Mandy.

19:11.060 --> 19:12.060
Thanks, dad. Keys?

19:12.111 --> 19:13.711
Yeah, sure.

19:13.746 --> 19:15.363
I gotta go to Travis.

19:15.397 --> 19:17.899
We still have time to get our mani-pedis!

19:19.735 --> 19:22.720
Travis.

19:22.755 --> 19:25.089
If no one's coming to dinner,
and you're watching Boyd,

19:25.124 --> 19:26.724
then I'm gonna have three glasses of wine,

19:26.759 --> 19:29.160
take a bath, and go to bed.

19:30.212 --> 19:31.796
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hi, dad.

19:31.830 --> 19:33.831
What? What? What? Victor Blake.

19:33.865 --> 19:36.033
Uh, uh, uh, sprained ankle Victor Blake?

19:36.051 --> 19:38.202
Yeah. He called me, and
he liked the way I played.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.088
I told you that was gonna work out.

19:40.139 --> 19:42.890
He asked me out, dad. My first real date!

19:42.925 --> 19:46.010
I'll be aggressive
just like you taught me.

19:46.045 --> 19:49.414
No, no, no, no. Aggressive is bad! It...

19:50.816 --> 19:52.183
Nice going, coach.

19:52.217 --> 19:54.736
<i>I did not see that coming.</i>

19:54.770 --> 19:59.907
Boy, I bet you're happy to be
hitting the road again, huh?

19:59.942 --> 20:01.075
I'm not going anywhere.

20:01.110 --> 20:04.062
What if Victor Blake can't change a tire?

20:04.096 --> 20:06.230
What are you saying?

20:08.033 --> 20:10.118
I'm saying... with your new promotion,

20:10.169 --> 20:12.236
you're gonna need a
lot of help around here.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.739
And that's you?

20:14.757 --> 20:18.626
Then I will definitely
need three glasses of wine.

20:18.677 --> 20:21.429
What's a man's number one responsibility?

20:21.463 --> 20:25.299
Mm, terrorizing his daughter's boyfriends?

20:25.351 --> 20:26.718
You get me.

20:26.752 --> 20:27.719
Mm.

20:27.753 --> 20:29.721
Which is why I married you.

20:29.755 --> 20:32.774
I thought it was for my sturdy foundation.

20:35.527 --> 20:38.162
Snitch!

20:43.257 --> 20:45.444
The manly arts are
vanishing. That's a fact.

20:45.564 --> 20:48.081
What do we do when the aliens invade

20:48.201 --> 20:50.186
or the zombies come out of their graves

20:50.306 --> 20:51.747
and the machines rise up?

20:51.867 --> 20:53.354
Who's gonna lead us?

20:53.388 --> 20:55.223
You.

20:55.274 --> 20:58.226
I have all this knowledge. It's my duty...

20:58.277 --> 21:02.697
To pass it on for the future of mankind.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.193
And very important lesson tonight.

21:05.313 --> 21:07.300
This one here. Right
here. Put 'em up here.

21:07.420 --> 21:09.687
How do we get this little piggy

21:09.705 --> 21:13.124
<i>all the way the over to market?</i>

21:17.452 --> 21:18.925
Mandy?!

21:19.305 --> 21:25.751
