00:15.307 --> 00:21.438
Did you know that the oldest known lullaby
is a 5,000-year-old Babylonian song?

00:24.316 --> 00:29.154
"Little baby in the dark house,
you have seen the sun rise.

00:30.322 --> 00:33.992
Why are you crying? Why are you screaming?

00:34.910 --> 00:36.995
You have disturbed the house god.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.334
Tell me your journey. Each of you.

00:42.417 --> 00:46.839
Tell me your life's voyage,
and I will tell you who you are."

01:51.486 --> 01:52.529
Hello?

01:55.324 --> 01:56.325
Emma.

02:01.914 --> 02:03.332
What are you doing here?

02:03.415 --> 02:05.542
I've been calling and texting for a week.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.294
Six-month check for you and Brian.

02:08.878 --> 02:11.006
He's not here. I have somewhere to go.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.007
What?

02:13.133 --> 02:15.135
You understand he needs a checkup?

02:17.054 --> 02:18.138
Okay, where are we going?

02:25.604 --> 02:29.608
I stopped checking my phone.
That's why I didn't know you were coming.

02:29.691 --> 02:30.776
Stopped when?

02:31.652 --> 02:32.986
About a month ago.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.363
Emma!

02:39.576 --> 02:41.912
Apollo takes the baby
to the park every morning.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.414
He doesn't sleep much anymore either.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.332
Brian?

02:45.415 --> 02:49.169
Apollo. Having nightmares.
We're all a mess.

02:49.795 --> 02:52.464
You could try a little Benadryl
to help you sleep.

02:52.548 --> 02:54.925
You can take a little
while you're breastfeeding.

02:59.721 --> 03:05.102
I'm worried about you, Emma.
I see you, and I feel worried.

03:22.578 --> 03:23.412
Can I help you?

03:24.955 --> 03:29.084
I heard about you from the message board.
You were told I'd come.

03:34.256 --> 03:35.090
Who sent you?

03:36.175 --> 03:37.176
Cal sent me.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.106
I hope these are useful.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.783
What the hell is in there? Emma?

04:07.289 --> 04:09.917
Chains. Chains?

04:11.043 --> 04:13.962
Emma.

04:28.393 --> 04:31.146
-We're here.
-My mom and your sister are here.

04:32.231 --> 04:34.233
Oh, baby.

04:34.316 --> 04:41.156
Red bean soup, meat loaf, mashed potatoes,
lasagna, samosas, two quiches, oxtail.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.241
Thank you.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.202
I love this little munchkin.

04:49.581 --> 04:53.418
Apollo tells me you're having trouble.
I had the same problem with him.

04:53.502 --> 04:57.172
I didn't have my mother with me either.
Flying with closed eyes.

04:57.256 --> 04:58.340
Flying blind.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.843
-It just takes time.
-Yeah.

05:00.926 --> 05:03.262
I'll help. Let me see what you're doing.

05:05.055 --> 05:08.267
-Good morning. All awake?
-Wait.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.568
Too bad.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.361
-What?
-Your breasts are wrong.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.612
-Mom.
-Lillian.

05:20.696 --> 05:22.990
Come on. All right. Let's not do that.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.075
Just-- To the kitchen, Mom.

05:29.955 --> 05:33.417
Easier to know it.
Sad truth is better than a happy lie.

05:35.711 --> 05:39.506
Mom, thanks
for bringing the food, honestly. But--

05:43.760 --> 05:45.179
Brian.

05:45.262 --> 05:46.346
That's his name.

05:47.222 --> 05:49.391
Brian. Brian.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.352
-All right.
-You honor an invisible man.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.981
Did you come here
to ruin the day for everybody?

05:57.149 --> 05:58.609
Looks like it.

06:08.994 --> 06:12.497
When a baby is born,
a mother is also born.

06:13.749 --> 06:15.501
She never existed before.

06:17.753 --> 06:22.341
The woman existed,
but a mother is something absolutely new.

06:24.593 --> 06:27.387
I just wanna be the perfect mom.

06:32.476 --> 06:33.894
You're his perfect mom.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.897
Well, I learned from the greatest.

06:38.357 --> 06:42.361
I had a rooster

06:43.570 --> 06:46.490
That rooster pleased me

06:48.951 --> 06:54.998
I held my rooster
By the old willow tree

06:56.166 --> 06:57.501
Stop complaining.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.671
You know who I'm talking about.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.260
I had a cat

07:06.885 --> 07:09.429
My cat pleased me

07:10.097 --> 07:16.228
I held my cat
By the old willow tree

07:34.621 --> 07:37.249
After two months of little to no sleep,

07:37.833 --> 07:40.335
a person might suffer panic attacks,

07:40.419 --> 07:45.007
paranoia, and phobias
no lullaby can soothe.

07:50.429 --> 07:52.639
I don't understand. Where are the buttons?

07:55.267 --> 07:56.643
-There he is.
-There we are.

07:56.727 --> 07:57.936
It's a smartphone, Mom.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.190
How's he sleeping?

08:02.316 --> 08:05.527
I read something that said
he should be at six to nine hours.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.238
I'll believe it when I sleep it.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.323
Hi.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.408
-Hey.
-Babe.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.367
What?

08:12.451 --> 08:14.369
-Hey, can you-- Sorry. I'm gonna--
-Oh, yeah.

08:14.453 --> 08:17.039
We're trying to limit the screen time.
It's not good for him.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.207
A telephone?

08:18.290 --> 08:20.042
Yeah, he's just a little too young.

08:20.959 --> 08:24.087
He's too young for it. I'm too old for it.

08:24.171 --> 08:28.675
So instead, we'll spend the whole night
playing games…

08:28.759 --> 08:31.303
-Uh-huh.
-…and hugging.

08:31.386 --> 08:32.386
Nice.

08:34.890 --> 08:37.351
So, where are we baptizing him?

08:38.184 --> 08:39.477
We actually weren't--

08:39.561 --> 08:42.606
Unless one is born of water and spirit,
he cannot be saved.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.941
Saved from?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.527
The dark creatures of the world.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.488
Thanks, Mom.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.281
Yeah, thank you, Mom.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.537
Wait. Right there.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.957
Oh, my God.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.668
Thank you.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.003
You're thanking me for a gift?

09:05.712 --> 09:07.714
You are a gift.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.344
I've missed you. Not you. The wine.

09:17.266 --> 09:18.600
That's good.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.812
Can I just-- You just got a little--

09:21.895 --> 09:23.105
-What?
-A little--

09:24.815 --> 09:26.233
-There you go.
-Thank you.

09:28.819 --> 09:30.946
So, what's happening with the appraisal?

09:31.029 --> 09:33.323
That dude's slow. Slug turtle.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.492
Think you can trust him?

09:35.576 --> 09:36.493
'Cause you know,

09:36.577 --> 09:39.705
he's probably taking breaks
every five minutes to jerk off

09:39.788 --> 09:44.668
to puppet porn or something.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.213
There she is.

09:49.006 --> 09:51.717
People tell you all
about how you'll love your baby

09:51.800 --> 09:54.428
more than you'll love anything
in the world,

09:55.095 --> 09:56.346
which is true.

09:57.139 --> 10:00.267
But now you have this thing
that you love so much,

10:00.350 --> 10:02.728
you'll have to kill yourself
if anything happens to it.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.188
They don't tell you that.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.107
-Right.
-They don't say that.

10:07.191 --> 10:09.276
Everything's right except that part
about killing yourself.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.360
No.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.613
He dies, I die.

10:12.696 --> 10:14.448
Sorry, you're on your own.

10:14.531 --> 10:18.452
Okay, well, if you were gonna do that,
how would you do it?

10:20.162 --> 10:21.788
Jump off George Washington Bridge.

10:22.748 --> 10:24.124
What? You?

10:24.208 --> 10:25.417
Yes. Me.

10:25.501 --> 10:28.462
I would not have had you pegged
for someone that would jump off a bridge.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.130
-Why? I want clean.
-Sorry. It's something--

10:30.214 --> 10:32.466
I just wanna… plop.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.344
-You know?
-Belly flop.

10:35.427 --> 10:36.428
Yeah.

10:39.556 --> 10:40.557
Hey, you wanna…

10:42.976 --> 10:44.186
Hey, you wanna do a thing?

10:59.284 --> 11:00.619
I'm so glad we went out.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.334
You know,
it really feels like we turned a corner.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.297
You know?

11:34.820 --> 11:35.821
Handsome boy.

11:35.904 --> 11:38.115
Hey, I gotta get you right now.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.658
Here.

11:40.742 --> 11:44.246
Oh, my God. Like father, like son, huh?
Handsome.

11:44.746 --> 11:45.914
Hey, Shoji.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.709
-Hey, man. Good to see ya.
-Hey. Say, "Hi."

11:48.792 --> 11:49.626
Good morning.

11:49.710 --> 11:50.794
-Hello.
-Hey.

11:50.878 --> 11:51.712
Hey, Imogen.

11:51.795 --> 11:52.838
-Hey, how's Emma?
-You see?

11:52.921 --> 11:55.257
-How's the breastfeeding? Yeah?
-She's good. She's-- Tired. You know.

11:55.340 --> 11:58.510
We're trying, but we'll get there.
We'll get there.

11:59.011 --> 12:00.804
-Hey.
-Hey, look at your buddy.

12:00.888 --> 12:01.972
-Staring contest?
-Ready?

12:02.055 --> 12:03.223
-Yeah. Go.
-Go.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.644
Hey.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.897
-Hey, look at this.
-It's your friend

12:09.980 --> 12:12.357
-who won the staring contest.
-I know you.

12:13.317 --> 12:14.318
Say, "Hi."

12:15.861 --> 12:16.862
Nothing?

12:18.155 --> 12:20.282
Two months old today, bubba.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.075
Two.

12:22.159 --> 12:24.453
Two, two, two months. Wow.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.497
Hey. There's a new dad saying
when we start him on solids

12:27.581 --> 12:29.374
that we should use avocado.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.711
Because if we use the sweet stuff--
like bananas, fruit--,

12:33.378 --> 12:35.422
then all he's gonna want is sweet stuff.

12:36.048 --> 12:39.051
Will you just please make sure
he doesn't get too cold today?

12:39.134 --> 12:40.135
-You know?
-Yeah.

12:41.595 --> 12:42.846
And coconut oil.

12:42.930 --> 12:43.972
Or too warm.

12:44.056 --> 12:45.724
It's supposed to be good for rashes.

12:47.518 --> 12:49.228
He's just so little.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.606
He needs me, Apollo.

12:52.689 --> 12:53.899
I know. We know.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.486
But we need your job and health insurance.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.989
Eight weeks maternity leave is criminal.

13:01.782 --> 13:02.783
It is.

13:04.201 --> 13:05.410
Look at him.

13:05.494 --> 13:07.621
-I know.
-He's just perfect.

13:09.915 --> 13:11.250
How will I breathe?

13:14.962 --> 13:16.171
Through your mouth, silly.

13:18.048 --> 13:21.510
Let's-- I'm gonna put you--
Sit you over-- here.

13:22.761 --> 13:25.097
Give you some cushioning here.

13:26.348 --> 13:28.475
All right, you'll be safe and sound.
Talk to you soon.

13:36.525 --> 13:38.443
Boom. All right, let's do this.

13:53.125 --> 13:54.751
Hey, buddy. You good?

13:55.752 --> 13:56.587
Okay.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.495
Hello?

14:36.668 --> 14:39.213
I just had a baby, but cool.

14:40.172 --> 14:42.090
-This is the loaf.
-Do we have everything?

14:42.174 --> 14:43.759
Thank you.

14:43.842 --> 14:45.677
Here, the halves-and-halves.

14:45.761 --> 14:46.970
-These look so good.
-Hi.

14:48.931 --> 14:51.350
-Welcome back!
-Welcome home, beautiful.

14:53.477 --> 14:54.645
We missed you.

14:55.229 --> 14:57.481
Thank you. Fuck.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.316
I'm clearly batshit now.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.152
-You will never stop crying now.
-No.

15:02.236 --> 15:03.529
Coffee and carrot cake.

15:03.612 --> 15:06.365
We saw all the ones Apollo posted online,
but we want more.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.367
-He sent me so many. You'll see.
-Let me see.

15:08.450 --> 15:10.160
Apollo took him to work today. So…

15:10.244 --> 15:12.204
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, no, stop it.

15:13.664 --> 15:14.665
Here we are.

15:16.667 --> 15:17.709
Okay.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.879
Let's go book-hunting.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.096
I didn't have that much gear
when I was fighting in Fallujah.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.181
Now I'm in my own little dirty war.

15:33.267 --> 15:34.351
Look at this.

15:34.852 --> 15:35.978
-Yeah.
-Nice.

15:36.061 --> 15:38.146
Grandmother. Died four months ago.

15:38.230 --> 15:41.066
Get this. I asked to use the bathroom,
and they said they didn't have one.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.402
Four bedroom house, no bathroom.

15:43.485 --> 15:44.570
-Imagine that.
-Yeah.

15:44.653 --> 15:46.530
Well, you would think that'd be something
you figure out

15:46.613 --> 15:48.448
-before you get the house, right?
-You'd think.

15:48.532 --> 15:49.533
Uh-huh.

15:50.158 --> 15:53.662
-Well, looks like Grandma likes books.
-Still haven't checked the basement.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.164
Thought I'd leave something for you.

15:56.665 --> 15:59.376
Uncle Patrice scared
of a little dingy old basement.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.878
We'll split whatever you find 60-40.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.796
Look me in my eye.

16:03.380 --> 16:06.216
Tell us what happened in Iskandariyah,
Uncle Patrice.

16:06.925 --> 16:09.261
Tell your dad I said, "Fuck you."

16:11.763 --> 16:14.766
Can you say, "PTSD"? PTSD.

16:14.850 --> 16:16.393
I'm starting to understand
why your pops abandoned you.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.479
Oh, come on. Low blow.

16:44.129 --> 16:45.130
Sorry.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.007
Oh, well.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.219
All right, the mystery of boxes.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.138
I've always loved it.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.641
That's 'cause you never know
what's inside.

16:55.724 --> 16:56.808
What's that?

16:58.101 --> 17:01.271
You wanna hear a story about a box?
I got one for ya.

17:02.439 --> 17:07.736
My father, your grandfather,
his name was Brian West.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.279
You're actually named after him.

17:09.905 --> 17:14.201
When I turned 12,
he left a box at my door.

17:15.827 --> 17:21.333
And inside that box were a pair of tickets
to he and Grandma's first date, movies,

17:22.251 --> 17:26.046
a little children's book
he read to me, and a bunch of other stuff.

17:26.630 --> 17:29.800
Yeah, I know.
It was kind of like a time capsule.

17:34.471 --> 17:38.475
What's the name of the book?
Well, since you asked so nicely,

17:39.560 --> 17:41.937
To The Waters And The Wild.

17:42.980 --> 17:44.106
It's a good one.

17:49.820 --> 17:54.867
"A baby is a dream made real.
But dreams are the fairies' favorite meal.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.537
There at the window,
they watch as it sleeps.

17:59.830 --> 18:03.000
The child so beautiful, the fairies weep."

18:07.379 --> 18:09.798
Let's see what else we got here.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.599
Looks just like more…

18:55.052 --> 18:56.053
Hi.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.888
-Hi.
-What you looking for?

18:58.722 --> 19:00.974
The Imaginaries. Yep.

19:10.526 --> 19:11.777
What the fuck?

19:17.282 --> 19:18.408
Where'd it go?

19:38.011 --> 19:40.347
Apollo? What?

19:40.848 --> 19:41.974
What are you doing?

19:42.558 --> 19:44.142
Give him to me. What-- Hi.

19:44.226 --> 19:47.062
-Oh, my God. Yes.
-What is it? What?

19:47.145 --> 19:48.480
It looked like--

19:50.190 --> 19:52.651
Oh, my God.
Apollo, he's actually latching.

19:52.734 --> 19:55.487
What a day.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.197
Big boy.

19:59.449 --> 20:00.784
What?

20:03.829 --> 20:06.123
-To Kill a Mockingbird.
-That's right.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.584
A true first edition.

20:08.667 --> 20:11.879
Original cover.
It's in pristine condition. Not a scratch.

20:11.962 --> 20:13.338
Nice find.

20:13.422 --> 20:18.218
Now, a book like that
could get us $10,000 or something.

20:19.178 --> 20:21.597
Ten? No. What?

20:21.680 --> 20:24.141
But Harper Lee does not sign books.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.727
Well, she signed this one.

20:27.561 --> 20:31.899
-Wait, who's Pip?
-Childhood best friend. Prolific writer.

20:31.982 --> 20:34.318
A name that you've probably heard of.

20:35.861 --> 20:36.904
Truman Capote?

20:37.738 --> 20:38.697
What?

20:38.780 --> 20:40.490
Yes. Yeah.

20:40.574 --> 20:41.408
Oh, my God.

20:41.491 --> 20:43.702
That's not even the best part.
Look at what she wrote to him.

20:43.785 --> 20:45.370
"The daddy of our dreams."

20:45.954 --> 20:46.872
Yeah.

20:47.372 --> 20:50.584
-We can get an apartment. A place to live.
-Yeah.

20:50.667 --> 20:53.212
Let's get an appraisal
before we go into escrow.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.506
But yes, baby.

20:57.633 --> 20:59.968
You are the god, Apollo.

21:03.138 --> 21:04.681
-Look at him.
-One more time.

21:05.682 --> 21:09.061
You are the god, Apollo.

21:13.106 --> 21:14.107
I know.

21:24.535 --> 21:26.537
What's going on?

21:30.999 --> 21:33.710
Hey, what's wrong?

21:37.923 --> 21:39.049
What's going on?

22:03.407 --> 22:04.491
There he is.

22:05.117 --> 22:06.910
I am so glad you brought the kid.

22:08.745 --> 22:10.205
You look like Master Blaster.

22:12.082 --> 22:13.417
Who runs Bartertown?

22:13.500 --> 22:16.044
Master Blaster runs Bartertown.

22:17.337 --> 22:22.342
Although I feel like Brian and I are
more similar to Kuato and his brother.

22:22.426 --> 22:24.928
You really gonna compare your baby
to motherfucking Kuato?

22:25.012 --> 22:29.433
The martians love Kuato, excuse me.
He's like their George Washington.

22:30.309 --> 22:32.853
Or Martin Luther King. Oprah.

22:33.562 --> 22:34.938
You're a weird dude, my man.

22:35.022 --> 22:36.690
Yeah. I know.

22:39.776 --> 22:40.777
Stinky butt.

22:48.619 --> 22:50.120
Here we go.

22:50.204 --> 22:52.748
Don't get used to this.
I'm not doing it forever.

22:57.544 --> 22:58.545
Problem?

23:01.423 --> 23:04.968
Apparently people have never seen a baby
get their diaper changed before.

23:06.678 --> 23:09.348
There you go, big boy. Okay.

23:11.099 --> 23:12.935
Did I tell you how happy
I was you brought the kid?

23:14.686 --> 23:18.232
You know, you and Dana should really think
about having a kid, just saying.

23:18.315 --> 23:19.942
Yeah, you might be right about that one.

23:20.025 --> 23:22.152
I mean, how else will I know the joy
of walking around

23:22.236 --> 23:24.279
with a handful of warm human shit?

23:26.532 --> 23:28.158
He's too young for that carrier.

23:29.535 --> 23:33.455
His legs splayed out
like that could cause hip dysplasia. Yeah.

23:33.539 --> 23:36.250
Okay. How old are yours?

23:37.543 --> 23:40.212
-Your kids?
-I don't have kids.

23:42.506 --> 23:43.757
Call me when you do.

23:45.843 --> 23:46.927
"Fuckoffy."

23:47.594 --> 23:48.846
What?

23:48.929 --> 23:49.930
Call him "fuckoffy."

23:50.013 --> 23:53.141
Well, it's just like regular coffee,
only instead of sitting around, chatting,

23:53.225 --> 23:54.434
discussing brat-rearing,

23:54.518 --> 23:57.563
you simply have a hot cup
of "shut the fuck up."

23:59.356 --> 24:00.816
Sounds good. I'm down.

24:00.899 --> 24:04.111
I could come around at 6:00-- 9:00?

24:04.611 --> 24:05.737
I meant it.

24:05.821 --> 24:07.281
Yeah. I don't know.

24:07.364 --> 24:08.991
-Not thirsty, apparently.
-I guess not.

24:09.074 --> 24:10.993
-Was it the way you said it?
-It might be.

24:12.703 --> 24:14.580
-Thank you.
-Yeah, you're welcome.

24:15.163 --> 24:16.874
Find anything good in that basement?

24:18.083 --> 24:19.751
No, it was just a bust.

24:19.835 --> 24:22.212
I was looking for somewhere to thro--

24:22.296 --> 24:25.716
You know what? Here.
Just hold that for me. Yeah.

24:26.884 --> 24:27.885
"Fuckoffy".

24:28.677 --> 24:32.431
-Guess I'll just put it with Grisham.
-Who wants some fuckoffy?

24:52.868 --> 24:54.328
I've forgotten something.

24:57.581 --> 24:58.874
I'm forgetting stuff.

24:59.833 --> 25:00.876
It's mommy brain.

25:01.543 --> 25:05.422
You will forget 20 things a day,
remember five, then forget them again.

25:05.506 --> 25:06.423
Uh-huh.

25:06.507 --> 25:07.925
I forgot my son once.

25:08.425 --> 25:10.761
In his car seat, on the roof of the car.

25:10.844 --> 25:13.847
Went into the house,
only remembered at dinner time.

25:16.266 --> 25:17.100
What?

25:17.184 --> 25:20.354
Yes, he was fine.
He slept right through it.

25:21.104 --> 25:22.189
-Good.
-Yeah.

25:23.232 --> 25:25.817
You're okay. Carry on, my love.

25:25.901 --> 25:26.985
-Thank you.
-Okay.

26:21.623 --> 26:22.791
What the fuck?

26:32.926 --> 26:33.927
Excuse me.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.041
Emma?

27:05.459 --> 27:07.878
Man, it's dark. Emma!

27:09.671 --> 27:10.672
It's okay.

27:13.675 --> 27:14.676
Emma.

27:16.261 --> 27:17.471
It's you.

27:18.597 --> 27:19.806
What are you doing?

27:19.890 --> 27:22.684
I found this group for moms online.

27:23.727 --> 27:25.145
The Wise Moms.

27:26.438 --> 27:29.399
They said this was the best way
to black out the room.

27:29.483 --> 27:32.486
Okay.
I thought we weren't sleep training yet.

27:32.569 --> 27:34.446
Why did you lie Brian down

27:34.530 --> 27:35.906
-on that driveway?
-What?

27:36.490 --> 27:38.200
In the driveway, you laid him down.

27:40.369 --> 27:42.079
I was trying to do something,

27:42.162 --> 27:43.705
and he was strapped to me.
So I put him down,

27:43.789 --> 27:45.040
just only for a few seconds.

27:45.123 --> 27:47.793
But wait,
how did you even know about that?

27:48.460 --> 27:50.629
You sent me a picture and then deleted it.

27:52.297 --> 27:53.423
No, I didn't.

27:53.507 --> 27:54.716
What do you mean?

27:54.800 --> 27:57.553
You keep sending me pictures
then deleting them.

27:57.636 --> 27:58.846
What are you--

27:58.929 --> 28:02.140
Babe, I don't even think
that that's possible on the phone.

28:03.016 --> 28:04.101
Are you okay?

28:08.105 --> 28:08.939
Babe.

28:12.442 --> 28:15.821
Hey, you never said hello to Brian.

28:17.114 --> 28:18.115
Here.

28:21.493 --> 28:24.371
-Yeah, big boy.
-Okay, but it's gone.

28:25.747 --> 28:28.166
-Can you look? It's gone. It's not here.
-What--

28:29.585 --> 28:30.752
I don't know, baby.

28:34.798 --> 28:38.552
Well, maybe your phone's broken.
We can get that fixed. It's easy.

28:46.310 --> 28:48.187
What? What?

28:50.856 --> 28:52.024
He bit me.

28:52.107 --> 28:54.776
No, he doesn't even have teeth.

28:54.860 --> 28:56.278
You okay though?

28:57.487 --> 29:02.910
How would I know that you laid him
on a driveway if you didn't send it?

29:04.912 --> 29:08.582
Who took it? Who took the photo?

29:09.374 --> 29:12.878
'Cause it was of the two of you
from across the street.

29:15.339 --> 29:16.548
Baby, I don't know.

29:20.302 --> 29:24.890
Hi. Hey, bub. You're okay though.

29:29.436 --> 29:30.521
It's just weird.

29:32.481 --> 29:33.732
So weird.

29:35.734 --> 29:36.735
Maybe I'm--

29:38.237 --> 29:41.281
I'm so tired. Maybe I imagined it.

29:41.365 --> 29:44.326
The other day, I got in the shower
with all my clothes on.

29:45.911 --> 29:49.164
Socks, shirt, beanie.

29:49.665 --> 29:50.832
We're tired.

29:59.925 --> 30:01.635
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

30:15.649 --> 30:16.650
He's sleeping.

30:20.487 --> 30:21.822
Think we should move him?

30:21.905 --> 30:23.490
No, he'll be okay in here.

30:26.243 --> 30:28.453
Make way for the sandman.

30:35.794 --> 30:38.589
This is the furthest we've slept
from him since he was born.

31:02.070 --> 31:04.823
Be careful what you wish for Emma.

31:34.478 --> 31:35.771
Come on.

31:46.323 --> 31:47.324
Apollo!

31:48.075 --> 31:50.827
Apollo, look.

31:50.911 --> 31:52.663
-Okay, baby, I see it. It's--
-Yeah?

31:52.746 --> 31:55.290
It's 4 a.m. He needs to eat?

31:55.374 --> 31:59.586
No, Apollo, just look. It's there.
Look at it.

32:00.921 --> 32:03.173
-There's nothing on there, baby.
-Yes, there is.

32:03.257 --> 32:05.133
There's a photo that I just saw.

32:05.634 --> 32:08.720
-Here, I'll take him.
-What? There was a photo.

32:08.804 --> 32:11.306
There you go. It's just your diaper.

32:11.390 --> 32:12.558
You're fine.

32:13.851 --> 32:14.893
What the fuck?

32:15.477 --> 32:19.106
It's okay. It's okay, big boy.

32:19.773 --> 32:21.775
-Where is it?
-You're okay.

32:23.402 --> 32:24.403
It's okay.

33:03.108 --> 33:09.823
After six months of inability to sleep
comes mania, delusion, rapid weight loss.

33:09.907 --> 33:11.033
Sleep, child.

33:11.950 --> 33:16.079
If only would
and could close those teary wearies.

33:18.498 --> 33:20.292
Brian Kagwa?

33:21.710 --> 33:23.420
Brian Kagwa?

33:27.799 --> 33:29.134
He's enchanting.

33:30.594 --> 33:32.054
How's he sleeping?

33:36.850 --> 33:37.851
Doesn't.

33:38.685 --> 33:39.937
How's he feeding?

33:41.688 --> 33:46.109
Well, the baby wouldn't latch
in the beginning.

33:48.153 --> 33:51.114
Then he just totally changed.

33:53.450 --> 33:54.743
Now he's ravenous.

33:55.452 --> 33:56.453
That's great.

33:58.705 --> 33:59.706
He bit me.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.671
Okay, I don't think-- Let me see.

34:07.381 --> 34:09.257
Nope. No teeth.

34:09.967 --> 34:12.386
So, Emma, what are your concerns?

34:14.554 --> 34:16.639
Well, there's a few of them.

34:19.893 --> 34:20.978
Can't quite explain.

34:22.437 --> 34:27.609
But mostly I just wanna make sure
that he's normal.

34:28.193 --> 34:30.027
Oh, yes. He's perfectly normal.

34:32.281 --> 34:33.991
Emma, how's your mood been?

34:36.034 --> 34:39.036
I don't know. Fine.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.081
Don't you dare.

34:47.170 --> 34:50.174
You little fucker.
You little fucking fucker.

34:52.967 --> 34:55.929
Have you had any thoughts
about hurting yourself?

34:57.431 --> 34:58.473
Or the baby?

35:01.894 --> 35:03.270
What are we gonna do, baby?

35:04.271 --> 35:06.398
What are we gonna do?
Because we can't go on like this.

35:06.481 --> 35:07.482
Okay?

35:08.650 --> 35:12.154
We both know something's not right,
don't we? So what's it gonna be?

35:12.237 --> 35:13.322
What is your suggestion?

35:13.405 --> 35:14.865
Because one of us
is gonna have to change it up.

35:14.948 --> 35:19.786
One of us is going to have to give it up.
So tell me right now, what is it gonna be?

35:19.870 --> 35:21.246
Fuck off.

35:21.330 --> 35:23.332
Oh, fuck.
You're the real devil, aren't you?

35:23.415 --> 35:25.751
That's what I fucking thought.
Get out of my way.

35:27.211 --> 35:28.504
It's not a baby!

35:29.588 --> 35:31.548
-It's not a baby!
-Look, we're all screaming now.

35:31.632 --> 35:34.176
-Are you fucking happy?
-It's not a baby!

35:35.594 --> 35:37.763
Emma. Where'd you go?

35:38.555 --> 35:40.390
I took the baby for a walk.

35:40.474 --> 35:42.100
-Thought it might calm him down.
-Okay.

35:42.184 --> 35:44.978
-It didn't. Three, two, one.
-I got you. It's okay.

35:46.313 --> 35:47.314
Motherfucker.

35:47.397 --> 35:51.109
-Emma! Don't-- Goddamn it.
-He's an asshole!

35:51.193 --> 35:53.445
-She doesn't mean that, okay?
-Oh, yes I do.

35:53.529 --> 35:55.739
-He's the devil!
-She doesn't mean it. She-- Okay?

35:59.535 --> 36:00.536
Hello.

36:31.567 --> 36:32.818
What's funny, Emma?

36:36.488 --> 36:37.489
Nothing.

36:39.700 --> 36:40.701
Okay.

36:41.743 --> 36:43.370
That was Dr. Calero.

36:43.453 --> 36:46.164
She said that you brought Brian
to see her earlier.

36:48.876 --> 36:51.461
Well, she's worried about you.

36:52.963 --> 36:54.131
And Brian.

36:57.009 --> 36:58.010
That's sweet.

37:00.053 --> 37:02.764
Yeah, and I'm worried too.

37:03.891 --> 37:07.477
Okay? I think you should see a doctor.

37:11.815 --> 37:12.816
Yeah.

37:15.694 --> 37:17.196
I know that's what you think.

37:22.075 --> 37:26.163
I know no one's gonna believe me.

37:28.373 --> 37:30.000
I know that now.

37:31.793 --> 37:32.794
So…

37:35.547 --> 37:36.548
I'll go.

37:38.509 --> 37:39.760
Okay.

37:39.843 --> 37:42.638
Do you think we can afford it if…

37:42.721 --> 37:44.598
-Yeah, it's okay.
-…if they're gonna prescribe me something?

37:44.681 --> 37:48.602
We'll figure it out.
All right? We'll figure it all out.

38:01.615 --> 38:02.616
Thank you.

38:04.284 --> 38:09.081
I do love you, Apollo. And the baby.

38:09.581 --> 38:10.999
Yeah, and Brian.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.085
Yeah.

38:16.171 --> 38:17.172
I…

38:20.133 --> 38:24.304
I just need to find my way back to myself.

38:25.305 --> 38:28.767
-That's all. Then I'll be okay.
-I know.

38:28.851 --> 38:30.519
-Then we'll be okay.
-Hey.

38:32.104 --> 38:37.818
I'm gonna support you always.
Look at me. Always.

38:59.214 --> 39:00.215
Cal sent me.

39:02.259 --> 39:03.635
I hope these are useful.

39:09.850 --> 39:12.269
What the hell is in there? Emma?

39:18.609 --> 39:21.236
Chains. Chains?

39:22.362 --> 39:25.324
Emma.

39:35.209 --> 39:37.336
April 14th, 1990.

39:41.507 --> 39:42.925
You don't remember that day?

39:44.301 --> 39:45.886
I remember what you've told me.

39:46.970 --> 39:47.971
Which is?

39:48.555 --> 39:50.182
I don't wanna play this game.

39:50.724 --> 39:51.725
What?

39:56.647 --> 40:01.652
You and me came back from school,
and the trucks were already there.

40:04.029 --> 40:05.405
The house was on fire.

40:08.992 --> 40:14.248
Mom and Dad were stuck inside,
and the firemen took us to the hospital.

40:16.542 --> 40:18.460
Still don't get why they took us
to the hospital.

40:18.544 --> 40:19.670
That's what I told you, yes.

40:19.753 --> 40:21.588
But now I'm gonna tell you
what really happened.

40:31.849 --> 40:35.352
Mom told us we could skip school
and stay home.

40:36.728 --> 40:38.814
We ate Cap'n Crunch and watched TV.

40:40.691 --> 40:42.568
Watched TV and ate Cap'n Crunch.

40:43.986 --> 40:45.279
Then Daddy got home.

40:46.780 --> 40:47.865
Why aren't the kids at school?

40:49.199 --> 40:50.576
I want them close.

40:50.659 --> 40:52.703
I just got off the night shift.
I need some sleep.

40:52.786 --> 40:54.037
I don't want them here making noise.

40:54.121 --> 40:55.664
I need them close!

40:56.290 --> 40:57.291
You're crazy.

41:03.547 --> 41:05.132
Baby, let me do your hair.

41:09.303 --> 41:10.679
That was my hair.

41:10.762 --> 41:14.516
I had a rooster

41:15.267 --> 41:16.268
No.

41:16.935 --> 41:20.439
I had a rooster

41:21.190 --> 41:24.067
That rooster pleased me

41:25.736 --> 41:26.904
Stop complaining.

41:29.114 --> 41:30.157
I don't remember that.

41:38.290 --> 41:40.000
I knew the day was all wrong.

41:42.878 --> 41:44.880
Hey, wake up. House is on fire.

41:44.963 --> 41:46.465
We gotta go. Come on! We gotta go.

41:46.548 --> 41:48.008
Come on. Let's go.

41:49.426 --> 41:50.677
We were in the house?

41:53.597 --> 41:55.265
Did Dad try to carry Mom too?

41:56.350 --> 41:58.352
Mom set the goddamn fire.

41:59.728 --> 42:01.772
Come on. Let's go.

42:01.855 --> 42:03.065
-No!
-Let her go!

42:03.148 --> 42:04.149
I can't leave you orphans.

42:05.943 --> 42:07.861
We should all go together.

42:08.362 --> 42:11.365
And you look at Mom,
and you say three words.

42:13.784 --> 42:16.370
Let me go.

42:20.707 --> 42:22.125
Please.

42:36.807 --> 42:41.270
But he dies in the fire. Right?

43:07.629 --> 43:11.341
They took us to the hospital to treat us
for smoke inhalation.

43:12.801 --> 43:17.472
We were there five days
and then foster care till I turned 18.

43:20.851 --> 43:23.312
Why wouldn't you tell me
any of this before?

43:23.395 --> 43:25.022
Why did you change your mind?

43:30.402 --> 43:33.739
Because you've got the same look
on your face that Mom had that morning.

43:41.371 --> 43:44.499
Sometimes I look at Brian
and I don't think he's my son.

43:47.586 --> 43:49.338
Maybe it's his eyes.

43:52.257 --> 43:55.636
Or-- I don't know.

43:58.180 --> 44:02.768
Because he looks like Brian,

44:03.769 --> 44:08.440
but it's like he's someone else's son.

44:09.900 --> 44:12.569
Emma, you're exhausted.

44:12.653 --> 44:14.863
You had to go back to work way too soon.

44:15.697 --> 44:17.533
And when you were just a baby,

44:17.616 --> 44:20.536
your mother and father
were taken from you.

44:20.619 --> 44:23.664
It doesn't surprise me at all
that you might be worried

44:23.747 --> 44:29.378
that you're gonna lose the person
you love most in the whole world.

44:53.360 --> 44:55.362
By end of month six,

44:55.445 --> 44:59.199
hallucinations and panic attacks
become more pronounced.

45:01.159 --> 45:03.871
The person becomes unresponsive or mute.

45:04.371 --> 45:06.456
This is the final progression.

45:15.090 --> 45:20.554
There you go, big boy.
Come on. Yummy, yummy, yummy.

45:20.637 --> 45:21.638
Morning.

45:22.890 --> 45:24.183
Morning, Mommy.

45:25.809 --> 45:26.810
Dada.

45:27.936 --> 45:30.439
What? Oh, my God. Okay.

45:31.023 --> 45:34.359
Wait, say that again.
Do it again. Do it. Say it again.

45:34.443 --> 45:37.446
Hold on. Okay. Come on.

45:37.529 --> 45:38.572
Dada.

45:41.742 --> 45:45.621
Yes. Okay.
You're gonna be Internet famous.

45:46.205 --> 45:49.041
Oh, my God. That is amazing.

45:49.958 --> 45:52.920
So, the appraisal guy I was talk--

45:53.003 --> 45:54.755
I wanna get the baby baptized.

45:58.133 --> 46:00.135
Brian. She's talking about you, Brian.

46:02.346 --> 46:03.972
That's a big boy.

46:05.015 --> 46:06.850
Your mother has been asking
ever since he was born.

46:06.934 --> 46:08.310
I thought we should finally do it.

46:08.393 --> 46:09.394
Good job.

46:10.103 --> 46:11.855
His appetite is getting amazing.

46:12.481 --> 46:13.941
He's eating more than me now.

46:14.024 --> 46:16.860
I made an appointment
at the church around the corner.

46:16.944 --> 46:20.864
Holyrood. Father Hagen. Seems nice.

46:22.866 --> 46:23.700
When?

46:24.368 --> 46:25.827
Today, in an hour.

46:27.162 --> 46:28.163
Wow.

46:29.164 --> 46:32.918
Okay.
Glad you decided to include me in that.

46:33.001 --> 46:35.128
You don't have to be there.
I can take him on my own.

46:35.212 --> 46:36.129
What are you talking about?

46:36.213 --> 46:38.090
You're not going anywhere
with my son without me.

46:43.178 --> 46:45.222
Emma, why is your phone in the garbage?

46:46.348 --> 46:49.184
-I got another text last night.
-Okay.

46:49.268 --> 46:50.561
-A photo of you and the baby…
-Sure.

46:50.644 --> 46:51.645
…in the Zipcar.

46:52.563 --> 46:54.398
He was in the car seat.

46:54.481 --> 46:57.109
Photo was taken through the window,

46:58.068 --> 47:00.112
like someone crept right up next
to the baby. I don't--

47:00.195 --> 47:01.613
Brian!

47:01.697 --> 47:03.073
His name's Brian.

47:05.492 --> 47:08.245
I'm sorry, baby. I know.

47:08.328 --> 47:10.372
That was loud. That was loud.

47:16.795 --> 47:17.796
"Got him."

47:19.006 --> 47:20.007
What?

47:21.258 --> 47:22.593
That's what the text said.

47:23.635 --> 47:27.556
Right under his picture, in caps.
"Got him."

47:28.140 --> 47:30.142
Show me. Show me a photo.
Show me where it says that.

47:30.225 --> 47:31.977
-They're gone. You already know that.
-Show me at least one text that says--

47:32.060 --> 47:33.604
-They're gone.
-Because it never happened.

47:33.687 --> 47:35.022
Let's just go. Let's get ready.

47:35.105 --> 47:36.982
We're not going to church with you, Emma.

47:37.649 --> 47:40.360
You probably want to get him an exorcism
rather than a baptism.

47:41.445 --> 47:44.072
The message board said we can try therapy
or church, and we can--

47:44.156 --> 47:45.991
Well, I'm delighted you think a bunch
of old women can tell us

47:46.074 --> 47:47.993
how to live our lives and raise our kid.

47:48.577 --> 47:50.037
But you know what the problem is, Emma?

47:50.120 --> 47:53.332
You know what it really is? It's you.
You're the fucking problem, all right?

47:53.415 --> 47:55.292
Why don't you go
take another pill or something?

48:05.511 --> 48:06.512
Where you going?

48:27.449 --> 48:28.659
You don't see.

48:30.827 --> 48:31.828
But you will.

48:47.678 --> 48:52.349
Hey. No matter what happens,
you're coming with me.

48:56.937 --> 48:59.731
"Who has disturbed me?"
says the house god.

49:01.024 --> 49:05.112
It is the baby who has disturbed you.
The baby has scared you.

49:08.115 --> 49:13.328
Making noises like a drunkard
who cannot sit still on his stool.

49:14.496 --> 49:16.790
He has disturbed your sleep.

49:20.002 --> 49:23.380
"Call the baby now," says the house god.

49:25.507 --> 49:26.800
God, forgive me.
