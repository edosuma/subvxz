WEBVTT

00:07.119 --> 00:08.382
What's with the canvas?

00:08.407 --> 00:11.300
Some artist friends are coming over,

00:11.466 --> 00:14.263
and we're gonna give Yves
Klein a run for his money.

00:14.265 --> 00:15.390
Sounds messy.

00:15.414 --> 00:16.896
Speaking of, how's Josh?

00:16.921 --> 00:18.628
I'm lying and he's wasting his youth.

00:18.653 --> 00:19.806
But I think we're happy.

00:20.034 --> 00:22.502
Enjoy it and don't think so much.

00:22.527 --> 00:24.372
Also take anything
out of the living room

00:24.397 --> 00:25.326
that you care about

00:25.351 --> 00:27.057
unless you want it back
in a different color.

00:32.873 --> 00:34.646
Glad you could stop in, Bryce.

00:34.671 --> 00:36.686
Have you had a chance to
look at the press release?

00:36.711 --> 00:37.810
I have.

00:37.835 --> 00:39.100
Any comments?

00:39.515 --> 00:42.137
It's basic-ass boilerplate.

00:42.424 --> 00:45.211
Excuse me. "Basic-ass"?

00:45.236 --> 00:46.469
Bryce is being generous.

00:46.494 --> 00:48.592
This release is vague and stodgy.

00:48.617 --> 00:50.585
And nowhere in this
document do I read the words

00:50.610 --> 00:52.943
"ground-breaking" or "visionary."

00:52.967 --> 00:54.998
Kim's been my publicist since MIT.

00:55.023 --> 00:56.050
I'd like her to take a pass.

00:56.082 --> 00:59.133
We typically handle
press releases in-house.

00:59.462 --> 01:01.142
I'm so sorry I'm so late.

01:01.167 --> 01:04.224
The barista was having
a particularly bad day

01:04.250 --> 01:05.618
and felt like sharing.

01:05.643 --> 01:07.346
I guess I just have an open face.

01:07.372 --> 01:08.284
And an open mouth.

01:08.309 --> 01:09.667
- Could you...
- Okay.

01:09.692 --> 01:11.525
You're still drinking coffee.

01:11.550 --> 01:13.676
We switched to coffee cubes a while ago.

01:13.701 --> 01:15.649
Oh, I've been wanting to try those.

01:15.674 --> 01:16.936
- You can.
- This is so sad.

01:16.961 --> 01:17.731
I'm sorry; what does this

01:17.756 --> 01:19.630
have to do with the press release?

01:19.654 --> 01:21.253
You can't describe a flavor

01:21.279 --> 01:23.163
you've never tasted, Deeana.

01:23.187 --> 01:26.364
Where you see a circle,
Bryce sees a tree.

01:26.511 --> 01:28.124
Uh, put out the release as is.

01:28.149 --> 01:29.821
I think we have bigger fish.

01:31.783 --> 01:33.455
He's given us a lot of money.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.204
I think he just wants to be heard.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.399
Well, I hear him.

01:36.424 --> 01:38.818
The question is, should I be listening?

01:41.373 --> 01:43.841
I'm laughing, but I'm not happy.

01:43.866 --> 01:46.746
_

01:52.623 --> 01:54.393
Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay?

01:54.418 --> 01:55.642
It's not me.

01:55.667 --> 01:56.780
It's the Book Nook.

01:56.804 --> 01:58.192
It might be closing.

01:58.217 --> 01:59.382
What?

01:59.407 --> 02:00.324
That's impossible.

02:00.349 --> 02:01.947
The Book Nook's an institution.

02:01.972 --> 02:03.974
Which hasn't turned a profit in years.

02:03.999 --> 02:06.299
Rumor has it a SoulCycle
may be moving in.

02:06.324 --> 02:07.703
"Be careful what you wish for"

02:07.728 --> 02:08.997
is the story of my life.

02:09.023 --> 02:10.848
This is so sad.

02:11.329 --> 02:14.284
We used to sit in those big
brown chairs at the Nook

02:14.309 --> 02:16.393
every Saturday for hours and read.

02:16.417 --> 02:17.687
And gossip.

02:17.712 --> 02:19.678
Well, it's not a done deal yet.

02:19.703 --> 02:21.521
The book club is
getting together tonight

02:21.546 --> 02:23.879
to plan a fundraiser
to help save the store.

02:23.904 --> 02:25.947
We really need you here, Liza.

02:25.973 --> 02:28.966
I feel like my best memories
of that store are with you.

02:28.990 --> 02:30.039
I'll be there.

02:31.510 --> 02:35.193
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:43.639 --> 02:44.733
Okay, I don't want to do this.

02:44.758 --> 02:45.678
Uh-uh. No, no, no.

02:45.703 --> 02:47.324
You haven't been out since Thad passed.

02:47.349 --> 02:48.423
And I know you, Kels.

02:48.471 --> 02:50.693
You have to keep swimming or you die.

02:50.718 --> 02:51.987
That's sharks.

02:52.012 --> 02:53.411
Yeah, sharks and you, girl.

02:53.436 --> 02:55.090
Come on, this is gonna be fun.

02:55.115 --> 02:56.800
Okay, oh, nope. Gross.

02:56.825 --> 02:59.476
Ooh! Yes, winner.

03:00.362 --> 03:01.653
Do you like a super thin mustache?

03:01.678 --> 03:03.306
Okay, can you stop pointing?

03:03.332 --> 03:05.497
It's rude not to point in here.

03:05.522 --> 03:06.707
Mm.

03:06.732 --> 03:08.182
Do you work at PJ Clarke's in Tribeca?

03:08.207 --> 03:09.826
What? No.

03:09.851 --> 03:10.930
Are you sure?

03:10.955 --> 03:12.387
I work in finance, so I'm there a lot,

03:12.413 --> 03:13.876
and you look really familiar.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.337
Well, my fiancé worked in finance...

03:16.362 --> 03:18.603
Ex-fiancé.

03:18.629 --> 03:20.225
He died recently.

03:20.250 --> 03:22.116
Wow, that's...

03:22.141 --> 03:23.412
tough.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.622
Yeah.

03:24.647 --> 03:26.674
Eww. What a psycho.

03:26.699 --> 03:28.453
Okay, you sit on your perch...

03:28.478 --> 03:30.129
- Okay.
- And smolder, okay?

03:30.154 --> 03:31.969
I'ma go find us a home base, all right?

03:31.994 --> 03:33.699
Stay. I'ma text you.

03:39.460 --> 03:41.642
Please tell me you're
not in a relationship.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.439
It just ended.

03:43.463 --> 03:44.958
What's wrong with that guy?

03:44.983 --> 03:46.585
He died.

03:49.109 --> 03:50.581
What, um...

03:50.606 --> 03:51.699
Dead.

03:51.723 --> 03:52.573
Bam.

03:52.598 --> 03:54.080
Dead ex. Dead ex.

04:01.903 --> 04:05.764
_

04:05.789 --> 04:07.089
Lauren Heller?

04:07.114 --> 04:08.817
Yes, the one and only.

04:08.842 --> 04:10.104
Max Horowitz.

04:10.129 --> 04:11.945
Oh, my God, Max?

04:11.970 --> 04:13.477
Camp Rahmah!

04:13.502 --> 04:14.411
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

04:14.436 --> 04:16.539
Last time we saw each other,
I think we were both

04:16.564 --> 04:18.410
getting checked for lice
in the nurse's office

04:18.434 --> 04:19.228
Yeah, I remember.

04:19.254 --> 04:21.039
You told me that lice
was one of the many bugs

04:21.064 --> 04:22.424
I had living on my body.

04:22.449 --> 04:25.117
Yes, always had the mad
skills with the ladies.

04:26.021 --> 04:27.350
Why do you have all those pagers?

04:27.376 --> 04:29.836
Oh, I'm a doctor now. Well, intern.

04:29.861 --> 04:31.872
God, that makes so much sense.

04:32.295 --> 04:34.395
Hi, hi. How's it going?

04:34.420 --> 04:35.547
- Terrible.
- What?

04:35.572 --> 04:37.878
As soon as guys find out about Thad,
they bolt.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.293
Okay, how are they finding out?

04:39.318 --> 04:41.276
I don't know. It just comes up.

04:41.301 --> 04:42.876
You try having a dead fiancé

04:42.901 --> 04:43.719
and not mentioning it.

04:43.744 --> 04:45.086
Hi, I'm Max.

04:45.111 --> 04:45.963
Hi, Max.

04:45.988 --> 04:47.087
I'm leaving.

04:47.112 --> 04:48.842
What? Kelsey, please don't go.

04:48.867 --> 04:51.155
I just...
I need some alone time; okay, you stay.

04:51.181 --> 04:52.106
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

04:52.131 --> 04:53.769
But text me. Text me
if you need anything.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.848
- Okay.
- Bye.

04:57.604 --> 04:58.936
Ooh, that's a long story.

04:58.961 --> 05:00.495
She's... she'll be fine.

05:00.520 --> 05:03.036
So, uh, where were we?

05:03.061 --> 05:04.548
Um, lice check.

05:04.574 --> 05:05.846
Should I get us a drink

05:05.871 --> 05:07.400
before we start talking color wars?

05:07.425 --> 05:08.953
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes.

05:08.978 --> 05:10.173
I have a lot to say
about that, actually.

05:10.198 --> 05:12.307
That Blue Team was definitely doping.

05:12.332 --> 05:13.414
All right. All right, yeah.

05:13.439 --> 05:15.257
- Well, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

05:20.302 --> 05:22.373
Okay, do I have to wax?

05:22.397 --> 05:23.593
Please.

05:27.112 --> 05:30.458
Oh, it is so good to see that face.

05:30.483 --> 05:31.596
I've been worried about you

05:31.621 --> 05:32.914
ever since you quit Neiman's.

05:32.939 --> 05:34.108
Oh, I'm fine.

05:34.132 --> 05:35.838
That commute from Brooklyn was too far.

05:35.863 --> 05:38.157
Too far away from that boy toy of yours,
huh?

05:38.182 --> 05:39.573
Mm. Everybody's here.

05:39.598 --> 05:41.831
- Hey!
- Here, drink this.

05:41.856 --> 05:44.119
We're all already two
Bloody Mary Shelleys deep.

05:45.726 --> 05:49.202
I really want to thank all
you ladies for coming out.

05:49.227 --> 05:50.960
Maybe I'm being stubborn,

05:50.985 --> 05:53.909
but I am just not ready
to let this place go.

05:53.934 --> 05:55.701
Well, neither are we.

05:55.726 --> 05:58.026
I think we need to get
people's attention.

05:58.051 --> 05:59.325
Let the community know

05:59.350 --> 06:00.818
we may lose a landmark.

06:00.844 --> 06:03.110
Attention would be
great, but we need money.

06:03.135 --> 06:05.534
I still think the best
idea we've had so far

06:05.560 --> 06:06.385
is the calendar.

06:06.410 --> 06:07.541
What's the calendar?

06:07.565 --> 06:10.567
We started a Kickstarter
to do a nudie calendar

06:10.592 --> 06:11.680
like in that movie.

06:11.705 --> 06:12.967
Oh, wow.

06:12.992 --> 06:13.815
But then Leslie's husband

06:13.840 --> 06:15.393
started a Kickstarter to stop us.

06:15.419 --> 06:17.369
He made double the amount
of money we have...

06:17.394 --> 06:18.427
Thinks it's hilarious.

06:18.452 --> 06:19.532
Yeah, but it's all
going to the bookstore,

06:19.557 --> 06:20.770
so either way, we win.

06:20.795 --> 06:22.007
We should do it.

06:22.032 --> 06:23.041
I call July.

06:23.066 --> 06:26.108
Me, in a star-spangled top hat,
naked as a kitten.

06:26.132 --> 06:28.454
That's gettin' eyeballs.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.788
I'd slip a nip for the Nook.

06:29.813 --> 06:31.397
Oh, you know I'm all in.

06:31.422 --> 06:33.173
What about you, Liza?

06:33.198 --> 06:35.546
I have seen that ass at Zumba.

06:35.571 --> 06:36.263
What do you say?

06:36.288 --> 06:36.801
Oh.

06:36.826 --> 06:37.615
And those legs?

06:37.640 --> 06:39.785
You could be the maypole of May.

06:39.810 --> 06:40.457
I don't know.

06:40.482 --> 06:41.455
April and May.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.483
We could stretch those
things over two months.

06:43.508 --> 06:44.918
Oh, my God, yes!

06:44.943 --> 06:46.623
Are we sure this is the best idea?

06:46.648 --> 06:48.408
- Yes.
- Heck yes.

06:55.149 --> 06:56.212
How was the book club meeting?

06:56.237 --> 06:58.274
Memorable, as always.

06:58.299 --> 07:00.703
But we're definitely
gonna lose The Book Nook.

07:01.367 --> 07:04.106
Everybody wants easy
and simple and online.

07:04.131 --> 07:06.487
No one wants to go inside
an actual store anymore.

07:06.656 --> 07:08.155
It's sad.

07:08.347 --> 07:11.571
I used to take Caitlin there
every Saturday for story hour.

07:12.074 --> 07:13.565
You can't replace that with a click.

07:13.590 --> 07:14.569
Trust me, I get it.

07:14.594 --> 07:16.066
I mean, now there's no good place to go

07:16.091 --> 07:18.629
to the bathroom in Midtown
since that Borders closed.

07:18.810 --> 07:20.225
What?

07:26.955 --> 07:29.204
I've been dreaming of this day

07:29.229 --> 07:31.299
since I was 12 years old.

07:34.525 --> 07:36.487
I have a girlfriend.

07:39.530 --> 07:41.728
- Ugh.
- Wha...

07:48.309 --> 07:50.002
Well, the press release came out.

07:50.027 --> 07:53.619
"Hungry Tech Titan Feeds
on Publishing House."

07:53.644 --> 07:54.748
That's not good.

07:54.773 --> 07:56.343
Thank you, Miss Marple.

07:56.369 --> 07:57.948
Every news outlet's reporting the same.

07:57.973 --> 07:59.644
They're calling it a
"cultural disaster."

07:59.669 --> 08:01.583
They're not wrong. I mean, it feels

08:01.608 --> 08:03.256
like paper books aren't
long for this world,

08:03.281 --> 08:05.012
and that is a cultural disaster.

08:05.037 --> 08:06.454
Bryce wants to meet right now.

08:06.479 --> 08:07.578
Where is he?

08:07.603 --> 08:09.871
The Great Wall of China.

08:12.168 --> 08:14.470
This is amazing!

08:17.131 --> 08:19.381
Stop swinging your arms.

08:19.406 --> 08:21.366
Where are Bryce and Kim?

08:21.391 --> 08:22.490
Behind you.

08:22.515 --> 08:23.740
We were in the middle of a quest

08:23.765 --> 08:24.726
when we got the news.

08:24.751 --> 08:26.780
"The Post" called me
a cultural predator.

08:26.805 --> 08:29.750
This is just old media feeling
threatened by new media.

08:29.776 --> 08:31.276
Everyone is in a technopanic.

08:31.301 --> 08:33.125
Well, why don't we go back to the 1400s

08:33.149 --> 08:34.582
and kill the printing press?

08:35.178 --> 08:36.996
He's really upset.

08:37.020 --> 08:38.965
You guys need to make this un-happen.

08:38.990 --> 08:41.429
We will definitely put
our heads together.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.443
No one wants bad press.

08:43.469 --> 08:45.717
And let's not let ego get in the way.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.479
If you need me, you
know where to find me.

08:47.836 --> 08:49.788
Where's that, Narnia?

08:49.813 --> 08:52.069
We should go discuss this someplace...

08:52.094 --> 08:53.638
out of goggles.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.027
Where's Liza?

08:55.052 --> 08:56.534
Oh! I'm over here.

08:56.559 --> 08:58.789
You can see over the edge of the wall!

08:58.826 --> 09:01.596
Oh, God, this is not
good for my vertigo.

09:01.621 --> 09:03.777
I'm going over!

09:03.802 --> 09:05.208
Ow.

09:06.891 --> 09:08.670
Come in.

09:09.982 --> 09:11.380
Hey.

09:11.501 --> 09:13.835
Hey, there. How's Diana?

09:13.860 --> 09:15.039
Oh, uh,

09:15.214 --> 09:17.002
refused to see a doctor,

09:17.027 --> 09:19.182
but happy to treat me like a nurse.

09:20.179 --> 09:22.828
- Please sit.
- Um, about Bryce...

09:22.853 --> 09:24.706
I have kind of a crazy idea.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.998
I am open to anything.

09:27.023 --> 09:28.924
My hometown bookstore's about to close.

09:28.987 --> 09:31.383
The town is trying to
raise money to save it,

09:31.408 --> 09:33.001
but it doesn't look good.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.239
If Bryce donated money to keep it going,

09:36.264 --> 09:37.932
it would be enormous for the store

09:37.956 --> 09:40.296
and good press for him.

09:40.401 --> 09:42.500
Or maybe I'm just being selfish.

09:42.525 --> 09:44.222
That store was my sanctuary.

09:44.247 --> 09:46.876
It's where I first really
fell in love with literature.

09:46.901 --> 09:48.285
And it was a great hang out.

09:48.310 --> 09:50.230
My friends and I would sit around with

09:50.255 --> 09:52.305
our coffees on the weekends for hours

09:52.330 --> 09:53.452
and complain about our hus...

09:53.477 --> 09:54.663
Homework.

09:54.689 --> 09:55.962
Well, I think it's a great idea.

09:56.159 --> 09:57.959
- Really?
- I'm gonna pitch it to Bryce...

09:57.984 --> 09:59.557
on the phone.

10:00.253 --> 10:01.834
Thank you.

10:02.097 --> 10:03.711
Thank you.

10:04.622 --> 10:06.604
And it was Diana's idea.

10:07.119 --> 10:08.820
You don't have to say that.

10:08.845 --> 10:09.817
I do.

10:10.455 --> 10:13.108
It was so real, Kels.

10:13.133 --> 10:14.585
I saw a panda.

10:14.610 --> 10:15.622
What?

10:15.647 --> 10:17.875
- Code Bread.
- What's Code Bread?

10:17.900 --> 10:20.504
Lauren is on a bottomless
breadstick binge,

10:20.529 --> 10:22.621
which means something is really wrong.

10:22.646 --> 10:24.212
I don't have the emotional reserve

10:24.236 --> 10:25.322
to deal with this alone.

10:25.347 --> 10:27.558
- Okay.
- Come on.

10:28.827 --> 10:30.647
Max is just... He's so different

10:30.672 --> 10:32.063
than the people I'm
normally attracted to.

10:32.088 --> 10:33.809
You know, he's my age. He's hetero.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.340
He's a doctor.

10:35.365 --> 10:37.530
Oh, my God. Am I basic?

10:38.294 --> 10:40.494
No, you are not basic.

10:40.519 --> 10:41.767
No, no, you're right; that's insane.

10:41.791 --> 10:43.756
That's... but what if I'm straight?

10:43.781 --> 10:45.516
- So?
- Ew!

10:46.280 --> 10:49.137
Lauren, sexuality is
a spectrum, remember?

10:49.162 --> 10:50.014
You told me that.

10:50.039 --> 10:51.031
Yes, when we first met

10:51.056 --> 10:52.184
and I was trying to make out with you!

10:52.209 --> 10:54.093
And now I look at you
and I feel nothing.

10:54.118 --> 10:55.149
Thanks.

10:55.174 --> 10:57.274
Um, hold on.

10:57.299 --> 10:59.253
Oh, my God, it's a
picture of us from camp.

10:59.278 --> 11:01.085
Ah, Max's mom found it.

11:01.110 --> 11:03.178
Oh, my God,
he's already told his mom about me.

11:03.203 --> 11:04.156
I should end it.

11:04.181 --> 11:06.415
Or should I run over to the hospital

11:06.439 --> 11:07.754
and blow him in the call room?

11:07.779 --> 11:09.337
I mean, he's on a break,
which he rarely gets,

11:09.370 --> 11:10.712
and it would help me get my edge back.

11:10.736 --> 11:12.536
You know, I'm gonna go. I am.

11:12.561 --> 11:13.990
Don't tell Maggie about this, okay?

11:14.015 --> 11:16.621
Not until I figure it out. Bye.

11:18.284 --> 11:20.421
A man twisted his ankle running

11:20.446 --> 11:23.322
away from me last night,
and she meets a doctor?

11:23.556 --> 11:25.033
Life's a mystery.

11:30.354 --> 11:31.219
Liza!

11:33.190 --> 11:34.476
You okay?

11:34.501 --> 11:35.590
Charles had to leave,

11:35.615 --> 11:38.136
but he told me about
your bookstore idea.

11:38.161 --> 11:39.408
It was a shot in the dark.

11:39.433 --> 11:40.536
I was just trying anything.

11:40.561 --> 11:41.794
Bryce is on board.

11:42.004 --> 11:43.921
He's gonna donate $300,000,

11:43.946 --> 11:46.677
which will cover the rent
for the next five years

11:46.702 --> 11:48.763
and get him a lot of good press.

11:48.788 --> 11:49.901
So...

11:50.427 --> 11:51.874
good thinking.

11:52.745 --> 11:55.429
Cradle, don't squeeze. I'm injured.

11:57.905 --> 12:00.479
Hey, any good news?

12:00.504 --> 12:02.088
A lot of it, actually.

12:02.112 --> 12:04.886
This tech investor guy
showed up out of nowhere

12:04.911 --> 12:06.501
and offered to pay The Book Nook's rent

12:06.526 --> 12:07.675
for the next five years!

12:07.700 --> 12:09.900
What? You're kidding me!

12:09.925 --> 12:11.163
No, I am not.

12:11.188 --> 12:14.339
He is flying here
tomorrow in a helicopter.

12:14.364 --> 12:15.733
We're all gonna go to
the park and meet him.

12:15.758 --> 12:17.168
God, I cannot believe it.

12:17.193 --> 12:19.607
And to think how he found out about us.

12:19.632 --> 12:20.891
How's that?

12:20.916 --> 12:22.907
Well, obviously the Kickstarter

12:22.932 --> 12:24.171
for the nudie calendar.

12:24.197 --> 12:26.564
I mean, how else is
some Silicon Valley guy

12:26.589 --> 12:27.804
gonna hear about our little bookstore?

12:27.829 --> 12:29.462
Well, if that's the case,

12:29.487 --> 12:30.825
he might be expecting a show.

12:30.850 --> 12:32.487
Oh, honey, you know I'm ready.

12:34.000 --> 12:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:41.515 --> 12:42.941
Hey!

12:42.966 --> 12:44.600
You ready to go to Jersey?

12:44.625 --> 12:46.690
Oh, no, I'm gonna stay here
and hold down the fort.

12:46.715 --> 12:48.769
- What?
- Oh, here you go, sir.

12:48.953 --> 12:50.159
You're coming.

12:50.409 --> 12:51.766
When we land at the bookstore,

12:51.791 --> 12:53.272
people are gonna want to thank you.

12:53.297 --> 12:54.561
Lean in, girl.

12:54.586 --> 12:56.109
Oh, no, it's okay, really.

12:56.134 --> 12:58.847
You know, I still have some PTSD

12:58.872 --> 13:00.272
from the whole mall experience.

13:00.297 --> 13:01.682
Isn't it your hometown?

13:01.912 --> 13:02.995
Yes.

13:03.020 --> 13:04.562
But you know what they say:

13:04.587 --> 13:06.247
you should never go home again.

13:06.313 --> 13:07.945
Or you probably shouldn't.

13:07.970 --> 13:09.919
Especially with coworkers.

13:09.944 --> 13:12.589
Plus I need to stay in
the office for Diana.

13:12.614 --> 13:14.967
Oh, is she still "hurt"?

13:14.992 --> 13:16.191
Yes.

13:16.649 --> 13:17.927
But she'll tough it out,

13:17.952 --> 13:20.068
because that's what we do in publishing.

13:20.093 --> 13:22.250
This was your idea, Liza.

13:22.478 --> 13:24.060
I'd like you to be there.

13:39.017 --> 13:40.151
Hey.

13:40.176 --> 13:41.636
It's all over, Maggie.

13:41.661 --> 13:43.072
As soon as that helicopter lands,

13:43.098 --> 13:44.396
my two worlds are gonna collide.

13:44.411 --> 13:46.255
Oh, my God. Liza.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.724
What am I gonna do?

13:49.141 --> 13:50.477
Do you have a parachute?

13:50.502 --> 13:51.569
Liza!

13:51.930 --> 13:52.962
Hustle!

14:09.518 --> 14:11.280
Here it comes!

14:17.303 --> 14:20.140
I've got to tell you all something.

14:21.135 --> 14:23.734
People in this town know me.

14:23.759 --> 14:29.388
And it's possible they might
be saying things about me

14:29.413 --> 14:32.245
which might be confusing.

14:33.787 --> 14:36.005
I'm not the person you think I am,

14:36.030 --> 14:38.250
and I... I don't want you to be shocked.

14:40.367 --> 14:41.477
Take it back up.

14:41.502 --> 14:42.422
We're not landing.

14:42.447 --> 14:44.318
- What?
- What do you mean?

14:44.343 --> 14:46.422
Kim just told me that Old Man Zuckerberg

14:46.447 --> 14:49.166
rescued an independent
bookstore in Detroit

14:49.191 --> 14:51.987
staffed by orphans or some shit.

14:52.012 --> 14:53.519
I can't look like I'm copying him.

14:53.544 --> 14:55.203
Well, you can send it anonymously.

14:55.229 --> 14:56.314
Take it back up, Ryan.

14:56.339 --> 14:57.484
Oh, God, it's like

14:57.509 --> 14:59.283
the Great Wall of China all over again.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.601
It looks like it's turning around.

15:02.626 --> 15:03.725
Oh, no, it's just circling.

15:03.750 --> 15:06.893
No, it's going back up!

15:06.918 --> 15:08.383
Do they not know it's us?

15:08.407 --> 15:09.660
Hey! Hey!

15:09.685 --> 15:10.797
Someone show their tits!

15:10.822 --> 15:13.033
Hey!

15:13.356 --> 15:14.956
Come back!

15:16.083 --> 15:17.517
What were you gonna say?

15:18.600 --> 15:20.076
Huh?

15:20.101 --> 15:23.335
You said you didn't
want us to be shocked.

15:23.360 --> 15:25.396
- Did I?
- Yes, and you also said

15:25.421 --> 15:27.403
you weren't the person
we thought you were.

15:27.428 --> 15:29.327
Who are you then? What's
the big bad secret?

15:29.352 --> 15:30.868
Uh...

15:31.544 --> 15:34.654
I... I was a slut in high school.

15:46.991 --> 15:48.400
Hi.

15:48.425 --> 15:49.485
- Hey, hot stuff.
- Hey.

15:49.511 --> 15:50.910
Hey, can we hang out later?

15:50.935 --> 15:52.414
I'm kind of in the middle of a project.

15:52.439 --> 15:53.394
This is important.

15:53.419 --> 15:55.358
Um, Maggie... I...

15:55.384 --> 15:56.986
I ran into an old friend

15:57.011 --> 15:58.480
that I haven't seen in, like, forever.

15:58.505 --> 16:01.125
- Uh-huh.
- And, um, we hooked up.

16:01.425 --> 16:02.527
Oh.

16:02.661 --> 16:04.093
Okay.

16:04.348 --> 16:05.729
What's her name?

16:05.754 --> 16:07.285
Uh, his name...

16:07.310 --> 16:09.144
is Max.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.534
- Oh.
- He's nice and he's sweet

16:11.559 --> 16:12.982
and he's cute as a little button,

16:13.007 --> 16:15.247
you know, but, God,
he's so traditional, you know?

16:15.272 --> 16:16.242
I mentioned a thruple,

16:16.267 --> 16:17.574
and he said that he
didn't want to share me,

16:17.599 --> 16:19.332
which, I mean, that's 100% adorable,

16:19.357 --> 16:21.281
but I don't know;
this whole thing is just so not me.

16:21.306 --> 16:23.545
Look, Lauren, I mean this with love.

16:23.569 --> 16:25.236
Stop trying to be so interesting.

16:25.261 --> 16:26.099
Excuse me?

16:26.124 --> 16:27.123
Just date the guy.

16:27.148 --> 16:28.414
What? Really?

16:28.439 --> 16:29.493
Yeah.

16:29.518 --> 16:32.251
Oh. Maggie.

16:34.583 --> 16:36.415
You'll always be my owl.

16:36.440 --> 16:37.539
That's sweet.

16:37.581 --> 16:38.875
You're gonna be okay, right?

16:38.900 --> 16:40.234
I think so.

16:40.259 --> 16:41.506
- Okay.
- Yeah.

16:41.530 --> 16:43.731
- Um, I'll call you.
- Okay.

16:43.757 --> 16:44.984
Bye.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.778
So... where were we?

16:57.727 --> 17:00.656
I still don't know how we
fix this negative publicity.

17:00.747 --> 17:02.351
Don't worry about that.

17:02.376 --> 17:05.650
We'll release good books,
and good press will follow.

17:05.674 --> 17:07.550
I guess.

17:07.773 --> 17:11.709
So I heard your fiancé was
pancaked by a steel beam.

17:13.171 --> 17:14.824
He was.

17:15.047 --> 17:16.675
So then you're single?

17:16.700 --> 17:17.922
Yeah.

17:17.946 --> 17:19.656
Cool.

17:20.461 --> 17:25.250
The fact that my fiancé died,
that doesn't bother you?

17:25.275 --> 17:26.906
I mean, I didn't know him.

17:26.932 --> 17:28.744
Why would I care?

17:29.902 --> 17:32.768
Thank you for not caring.

17:33.382 --> 17:35.286
People say hot, meaningless sex

17:35.311 --> 17:37.606
helps the grieving process.

17:38.489 --> 17:40.050
Bye, Bryce.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.370
I still have the helicopter.

17:43.395 --> 17:46.785
We can go hover over the
Coldplay concert in the park?

17:48.034 --> 17:51.210
I am so sorry this didn't work out.

17:51.235 --> 17:52.897
Me too.

17:53.462 --> 17:55.363
Honestly, I'm starting to question

17:55.388 --> 17:58.064
whether it was smart to
bring someone like Bryce on.

17:58.248 --> 18:00.381
The company needs the money.

18:00.485 --> 18:03.243
Yeah, but you never know

18:03.268 --> 18:04.521
what's gonna happen when you get in bed

18:04.546 --> 18:05.635
with a 26-year-old.

18:09.638 --> 18:12.782
That's a... business term.

18:12.806 --> 18:13.681
Of course.

18:13.706 --> 18:15.983
See you tomorrow, Liza.

18:26.098 --> 18:29.293
Okay, I'm gonna have
one, maybe two drinks,

18:29.318 --> 18:31.069
and then say good-bye.

18:31.094 --> 18:33.739
You have as many as you want.

18:35.503 --> 18:37.819
I'm sorry again about the bookstore.

18:37.844 --> 18:39.176
It's okay.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.339
Bryce was only a temporary fix.

18:41.951 --> 18:43.919
I'd have had to say good-bye eventually.

18:43.944 --> 18:45.202
Have fun.

18:59.493 --> 19:01.169
Isn't this where we used to stand

19:01.194 --> 19:04.438
every Saturday and listen
to June read to the kids?

19:04.463 --> 19:05.579
It sure is.

19:05.604 --> 19:08.111
That's when we had the
idea for the book club.

19:08.136 --> 19:09.075
Huh.

19:09.100 --> 19:11.238
I thought I had the
idea for the book club.

19:11.263 --> 19:14.201
Well, maybe an early permutation,

19:14.226 --> 19:16.516
but not the book club.

19:16.774 --> 19:18.597
That was me and you.

19:18.622 --> 19:20.177
Look.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.672
Here's the wine stain from when Sherry

19:22.697 --> 19:24.912
explained sensation play to Joanne.

19:24.937 --> 19:28.562
Oh, my God.

19:29.187 --> 19:31.855
If we're gonna re-live the
"Fifty Shades" night,

19:31.880 --> 19:33.444
I gotta get the hard stuff.

19:40.525 --> 19:42.432
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:42.457 --> 19:43.972
What are you doing here?

19:43.997 --> 19:45.250
I thought I'd stick around

19:45.275 --> 19:47.275
in case Liza needed a designated driver.

19:47.300 --> 19:48.499
Ah.

19:48.524 --> 19:50.739
Which it looks like she might.

19:50.764 --> 19:52.770
Yeah.

19:53.143 --> 19:54.664
Wow.

19:54.854 --> 19:57.151
You are the real deal,

19:57.509 --> 19:58.708
aren't you?

20:00.597 --> 20:02.894
Bye.

20:03.528 --> 20:06.648
Helicopter was coming down. And then...

20:09.189 --> 20:10.674
It went back up.

20:13.084 --> 20:14.310
What's that for?

20:14.335 --> 20:16.034
Oh, I'm just happy for you, is all.

20:16.059 --> 20:17.603
Tom didn't even offer to drive me,

20:17.628 --> 20:19.406
and he knows how much I like to drink.

20:19.581 --> 20:23.245
And guess whose pubes
went white overnight.

20:25.827 --> 20:28.266
Listen. I'm not sad.

20:28.291 --> 20:30.445
Nothing lasts forever.

20:31.655 --> 20:33.556
And we sure enjoyed it while we had it.

20:33.581 --> 20:35.320
That's the most important thing.

20:35.345 --> 20:36.932
Here's to the next chapter!

20:36.957 --> 20:38.908
The next chapter.
