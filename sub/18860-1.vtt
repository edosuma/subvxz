01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.728
Katende, you do not speak any more

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:33.288
like a man who has only a part-time job.

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.169
These children have captured you.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.005
(PHONE RINGING)

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.001
Mrs. Gali.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.844
MRS. GALI: Robert, good news!

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.840
Your children are invited

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.810
to the international chess
tournament in Sudan.

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.930
Sudan? What is in the Sudan?

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.000
Sudan is where the African children's

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.650
chess tournament is held.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:58.610
Children from
all over Africa will be there.

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.922
It is sponsored by the United Nations.

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:04.601
Is it not far?

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:05.921
A thousand miles away.

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:09.124
That bus of yours would not get you there.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.691
- PHIONA: I'm going to Sudan.
- (LAUGHS)

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.129
There will be no bus this time.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.647
Phiona will travel by airplane

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:19.003
with Ivan and Benjamin,
to represent Uganda.

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:21.530
Think of that, eh?

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.640
Katwe children, our children,

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:25.960
representing the whole country.

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:29.124
These two children are not "our" children.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.850
They are my children.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.810
- Of course. I just meant...
- Me, I carried them in my body.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.166
BRIAN: Phiona is going in an airplane!

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:36.961
Ah...

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.004
BRIAN: Richard, Phiona is going to Sudan.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:49.810
When they return...

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.525
I have arranged for Phiona and Brian

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.320
to attend the school
where my wife teaches.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.440
Huh?

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.646
On a scholarship.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:56.881
Eh?

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.570
My wife has been teaching them to read.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:02.207
Yes! Yes, I know,
and I am grateful, but...

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:04.841
But what?

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:09.331
Isn't this what you wanted?
Education for your children?

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.842
Yes, but how can I pay for uniforms?

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.360
How will I save?

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.680
What time does school
begin in the morning?

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:18.571
Your children can do more
than sell vegetables.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.760
They have a chance to go
beyond this kind of life,

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:21.960
to go to school.

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.680
Maybe one day attend university.

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.286
Surely, you can understand
how important that is, eh?

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.206
Hmm.

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:34.603
I am not an educated woman, Mr. Katende.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.965
I understand nothing.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.370
(HUMMING)

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.960
HARRIET: You want to go to this Sudan?

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.564
PHIONA: Yes, Mama.

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:01.721
HARRIET: You stay always near your coach.

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.924
You do not know
what people there are like.

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.241
PHIONA: Mama, bye.

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.200
- HARRIET: Yes, Lord...
- BENJAMIN: Bye, Mama Phiona.

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:09.282
...I speak a blessing on my daughter.

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.086
Our Father who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:17.242
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:18.840
Give us this day our daily bread,

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.001
and forgive us our...

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:23.810
Bye, Benjamin.

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.246
Bye, Phiona.

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:27.163
Bye, Ivan.

(PHIONA INHALES SHARPLY)

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.844
Coach, is this heaven?

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:53.442
No. Heaven is a bit higher.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.726
I've never before seen an airport.

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.886
I only have two sets of clothes.

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:12.010
How am I going to win
these people over here?

Benjamin!

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.164
Benjamin, come. You also must practice.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:36.526
Go to Mozambique.

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:40.207
Our coach trained in Moscow.
He's a Grandmaster.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.042
He teaches students in Russia.

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:46.647
He almost beat Kasparov. Can you imagine?

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.002
Coach said that if I become a master,

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.606
I may receive a stipend
from our federation

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.489
simply to go to tournaments.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:55.682
What is it, a stipend?

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.569
What is it? (CHUCKLES)

01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.760
Money, silly.

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.410
Could I be a master?

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.920
Eh?

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.004
First, you have to win 50% of your games

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.288
in a FIDE approved tournament.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.727
Like the Olympiad, in Russia.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.724

- No.

would make Phiona's character stronger.

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.800
Since you took her to this Sudan,

Time to wash the cassava.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.280
It is improper for the tournament winner

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.044
to wash cassava.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:50.649

not tournament winners?

We're the cassava washers? Is that it?

I am her mother.
And she should do as I say.

She believes your game will
solve every problem of her life.

Why not then let us wash your feet, madam?

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.571
When I was a girl...

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.640
I was told stories

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:16.320
of a village by the lake that
never runs short of maize.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.440
Come back here!

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:19.727
Where there is no fighting.

my children a paradise, yes.

But now they feel
out of place where they are.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.608
That girl from Egypt
flies to Russia to see her coach.

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:44.366
She has her own computer to practice with.

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:47.364
She has biscuits. She has clothings.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.204
Why does this suddenly bother you now?

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.725
Because I won that girl.

Coach, I won her!

HARRIET: They will not
be able to return to their old lives

I will hold you responsible.

You're wearing your
determined face, Robert.

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:38.442
Phiona has the talent of a prodigy.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:42.447
And me, I do not have the experience

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.164
to properly train her.

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.448
Why should she be denied
the glory of victory

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.324
just because she was born here?

My mother had me when she was
still in high school.

01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:57.360
She couldn't even present me to my father

01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:59.249
because he had another family

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.651
so I was moved from aunty to aunty.

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:06.040
The first time I met my mother,

01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:08.009
I was six years old.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.287
And I could hardly believe
she was the one.

01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:14.531
I had always been called Katende.

01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:16.967
She was the one who told me
my name was Robert.

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:20.687
Robert Katende, I'm your mother.

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:24.649
I stayed with her for two years.

01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:29.525
And she became my everything.

01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:37.328
Then, this one Saturday...

01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:41.371
my grandmother came crying Mother's name.

01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.965
And I knew, in that moment, that...

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.843
Mama had died.

01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:56.411
I lost her for a second time.

01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:01.244

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:11.847
But what matters is
when you reset the pieces

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.207

01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:17.045

One day, you'll be ready for it.

And then your life could change.

01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:33.885
I don't want to go back
to my mother's place.

01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:39.682
