00:02.812 --> 00:07.125
Thanksgiving has always been my
favorite O'Neal family holiday

00:07.150 --> 00:09.083
because of our traditions.

00:14.711 --> 00:17.579
Traditions like me being
Mom's little sous-chef.

00:20.134 --> 00:23.968
Traditions like Shannon standing
guard until it's time to eat.

00:24.202 --> 00:25.335
Ow!

00:26.382 --> 00:28.793
Traditions like Dad
and Jimmy on the couch

00:28.827 --> 00:30.412
wearing their lucky jerseys

00:30.437 --> 00:32.865
and high-fiving over everything.

00:36.111 --> 00:39.553
And of course our dining
table lovingly set by me

00:39.578 --> 00:41.547
with all of the wisdom and strength

00:41.572 --> 00:43.316
of a post-prison Martha Stewart.

00:43.384 --> 00:44.779
Oh, sorry, Kenny.

00:44.804 --> 00:46.429
We got to put the extra leaf in

00:46.454 --> 00:48.703
to make room for Mom and I's plus-ones.

00:48.728 --> 00:51.210
What? You're bringing dates
to our family Thanksgiving?

00:51.235 --> 00:53.492
- Yeah.
- And our newest tradition...

00:53.561 --> 00:56.968
doing any [bleep] thing
we feel like, apparently.

01:01.382 --> 01:03.501
- Why?
- Why would you invite dates?

01:03.526 --> 01:04.825
Listen, I invited Gloria

01:04.851 --> 01:07.072
because I knew your mother
had invited V.P. Murray.

01:07.141 --> 01:09.675
Ugh. V.P. Murray is such a drip.

01:09.700 --> 01:13.576
Well, that drip is a licensed
notary... and our guest.

01:13.601 --> 01:16.734
- So you need to be nice to him.
- Fine.

01:16.759 --> 01:19.201
I guess if the pilgrims could
share food with the Indians,

01:19.226 --> 01:20.593
I could share food with him.

01:20.618 --> 01:21.553
Not what happened.

01:21.578 --> 01:23.937
Hello? Anyone home? Little help.

01:25.993 --> 01:28.093
Guess who's coming to dinner!

01:28.162 --> 01:30.320
The the cat you share
custody of with Uncle Dwayne.

01:30.345 --> 01:33.698
That's right, your cousin, sweet,
lovable, ancient Mr. Pickles.

01:33.767 --> 01:35.053
He goes back to Dwayne tomorrow,

01:35.078 --> 01:37.500
but I couldn't bear to leave
him by himself on the holiday.

01:41.524 --> 01:43.441
Is he still alive?

01:43.510 --> 01:45.442
Barely. I got more stuff in the car.

01:45.511 --> 01:46.944
So, you guys are bringing dates,

01:47.013 --> 01:49.539
and there's a cat fighting
for its life in our kitchen.

01:49.564 --> 01:51.492
That's cool.

01:51.517 --> 01:53.517
That's super, super cool.

01:53.586 --> 01:55.786
Yeah, I'm gonna need you to
continue the prep without me.

01:55.855 --> 01:58.722
What? But we always do this together.

01:58.791 --> 02:02.006
Yes, but V.P. Murray's having
Thanksgiving with his mother,

02:02.031 --> 02:04.086
and I thought it might
be nice to meet the woman

02:04.111 --> 02:05.386
who made the man that I'm seeing.

02:05.431 --> 02:08.544
Nice? Is it nice that you're wearing
your book-club eye shadow for him?

02:08.570 --> 02:10.501
Yeah, I see it, Mom.

02:10.526 --> 02:13.169
I'm just meeting them for
dessert before he comes here.

02:13.238 --> 02:14.656
And luckily, she's one
of those insane people

02:14.681 --> 02:16.414
who has Thanksgiving
dinner at 11:00 a.m.

02:16.439 --> 02:18.031
So I'll be home in plenty of time.

02:18.063 --> 02:19.883
But who's gonna chiffonade
the Brussels sprouts with me?

02:19.908 --> 02:21.244
That is a two-person job.

02:21.269 --> 02:24.214
You'll be fine. I won't be long.

02:24.524 --> 02:26.483
Come on, Shannon, grab your coat.

02:26.867 --> 02:28.397
What? Shannon has to go with you?

02:28.422 --> 02:30.328
That's karma for slapping me.

02:30.353 --> 02:31.945
See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya.

02:31.970 --> 02:33.656
Well, you're gonna see her and be her

02:33.681 --> 02:35.145
because you're coming, too.

02:39.163 --> 02:40.596
Kenny.

02:40.665 --> 02:42.164
I need your advice.

02:42.233 --> 02:45.084
So, I went a little too far
on my last date with Gloria

02:45.109 --> 02:46.459
with the skinny jeans.

02:46.484 --> 02:48.738
So this time, I decided
to play it a little safer,

02:48.807 --> 02:51.583
and I got myself a
pair of boyfriend jeans

02:51.608 --> 02:54.067
in case, you know, she
wants me to be her boyfriend.

02:54.092 --> 02:56.011
- It's not what that means.
- Whatever. It doesn't matter.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.612
Can you just do me a favor and tell me,

02:57.681 --> 03:00.282
do they make my butt look good?

03:00.351 --> 03:01.881
I...

03:02.490 --> 03:03.530
As far as I'm concerned,

03:03.555 --> 03:05.554
you don't have butt.

03:05.622 --> 03:08.222
So helpful. Really, thank you.

03:10.756 --> 03:12.894
Hey, Kenny. Happy Thanksgiving.

03:12.963 --> 03:14.420
Hm.

03:14.732 --> 03:17.298
Hey, Gloria. You're early.

03:17.367 --> 03:19.233
By like three hours.

03:19.302 --> 03:21.570
It's really nice of your family
to have me over for dinner.

03:21.630 --> 03:22.756
If Pat hadn't asked,

03:22.781 --> 03:24.553
I was just gonna have
another orphan Thanksgiving.

03:24.578 --> 03:26.274
Hm, with other friends and co-workers

03:26.299 --> 03:28.032
who don't have any family in town.

03:28.057 --> 03:30.778
No, with other adults
whose parents are both dead.

03:30.847 --> 03:33.114
Fun story.

03:33.183 --> 03:34.248
Oh, hey.

03:34.317 --> 03:35.816
Well, hello.

03:35.885 --> 03:38.162
Happy Thanksgiving.
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

03:38.187 --> 03:39.215
What... what are you...

03:39.240 --> 03:40.428
- what are you doing?
- What?

03:40.453 --> 03:43.067
What happened to the clothes
you had on like 30 seconds ago?

03:43.092 --> 03:45.237
I just wanted to put on something
a little more comfortable.

03:47.730 --> 03:49.162
Are you wearing cologne?

03:49.231 --> 03:52.165
No. I just got some new soap.

03:52.234 --> 03:53.776
Maybe that's it.

03:53.801 --> 03:57.070
Well, your "soap" smells like cedar

03:57.095 --> 03:59.239
with top notes of citrus and cardamom.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.167
- Eileen.
- Hello, Clive.

04:02.192 --> 04:03.683
Hello.

04:03.987 --> 04:06.279
Um, thank you for agreeing to do this.

04:06.331 --> 04:08.970
As I said, Mother's a little prickly,

04:08.995 --> 04:11.370
but the good news is she's not
going too long between naps,

04:11.395 --> 04:13.120
so this should be a short visit.

04:13.145 --> 04:15.998
Just do not bring up the
cancellation of "The Mentalist."

04:16.089 --> 04:18.324
We should be fine.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.358
I don't think it'll be a problem.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.175
I'll just kill her with kindness.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.363
Oh, God, she's gone Southern.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.365
Mom, when you go
overboard with politeness,

04:26.390 --> 04:28.901
you sound like the genteel neighbor
in a Tennessee Williams play.

04:28.926 --> 04:31.337
Well, I don't reckon that's true.

04:31.362 --> 04:33.639
Ooh, I find it alluring.

04:33.707 --> 04:34.940
I'll go get Mother.

04:35.009 --> 04:37.143
And I'll plate the pie.

04:38.246 --> 04:39.278
Ugh.

04:42.016 --> 04:44.147
- This place gives me the creeps.
- I know.

04:44.172 --> 04:45.408
Isn't it wonderful?

04:45.453 --> 04:47.386
Wha... why are you so happy?

04:47.649 --> 04:49.181
I hate that we have to be here.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.947
I hate that Mom is making
us hang out with V.P. Murray.

04:50.972 --> 04:52.581
I hate that Mom and Dad
aren't together any...

04:52.606 --> 04:54.359
Hey! Do not spin out.

04:54.428 --> 04:55.627
I'm here on a mission...

04:55.696 --> 04:58.583
to find awkward childhood
photos of V.P. Murray.

04:58.608 --> 05:00.452
I'm gonna blackmail him
into giving me free periods

05:00.477 --> 05:02.217
and get-out-of-gym passes.

05:03.603 --> 05:04.735
Jackpot.

05:04.804 --> 05:05.937
Forget childhood photos.

05:06.005 --> 05:08.203
I'm getting a strong
Norman Bates vibe here.

05:08.228 --> 05:09.649
10 bucks says there is no mother

05:09.674 --> 05:12.677
and V.P. Murray comes out wearing
a wig and an old-timey dress.

05:13.297 --> 05:15.246
Oh. What a striking woman.

05:15.271 --> 05:17.792
I'm drawn to her, and I don't know why.

05:19.775 --> 05:23.701
May I introduce my mother,
Victoria Pauline Murray.

05:23.726 --> 05:27.109
V.P. Murray's mother is
also named V.P. Murray.

05:27.134 --> 05:29.193
You must be James.

05:29.261 --> 05:31.725
You have a earnest and infectious smile

05:31.750 --> 05:33.698
that will serve you well in life.

05:33.766 --> 05:36.700
And you would be Shannon.

05:36.725 --> 05:38.973
Love the glasses. Men love smart women.

05:38.998 --> 05:41.438
You've got the world on a string.

05:41.981 --> 05:44.941
And, um... hm-hm-hm-hm.

05:45.010 --> 05:47.340
Clive, this woman's face reminds me...

05:47.365 --> 05:50.107
the weatherman said there's a
cold front coming in this weekend.

05:50.132 --> 05:52.416
and I need you to put
up the storm windows.

05:52.441 --> 05:55.052
So much for global
warming, liberal media.

05:55.077 --> 05:59.956
Well, it is a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Mrs. Murray.

06:00.025 --> 06:02.792
Oh, Clive didn't tell me
you were from a trailer.

06:02.853 --> 06:04.084
I'm not.

06:04.109 --> 06:05.929
I'm from Chicago. Yeah.

06:05.998 --> 06:08.297
Born and bred. Go, Cubs.

06:08.366 --> 06:09.506
Yeah.

06:12.470 --> 06:15.438
Beep, beep. Coming through.

06:16.192 --> 06:17.981
Do you have to put that
here? I'm trying to cook.

06:18.006 --> 06:20.317
Sorry, but this window
has the perfect sun spot

06:20.342 --> 06:22.278
for Mr. Pickles to curl up in.

06:22.347 --> 06:24.675
Plus, it has a view of the backyard.

06:24.700 --> 06:27.847
Mr. Pickles likes to look outside.
It gives him the illusion of freedom.

06:27.872 --> 06:29.762
Hey, have you guys ever
had sweet potato casserole?

06:29.787 --> 06:30.886
Ooh.

06:31.192 --> 06:32.222
Here.

06:32.801 --> 06:34.323
These are raw sweet potatoes.

06:34.348 --> 06:36.168
Do you know how long it
takes to cook a potato?

06:36.193 --> 06:37.893
Yeah, that's why I'm here early.

06:37.962 --> 06:39.817
That's good.

06:42.999 --> 06:44.999
Another blanket, Mother? Still drafty?

06:45.068 --> 06:47.269
No, no, no, I'm hot.

06:47.337 --> 06:49.404
Just remove the middle one.

06:49.473 --> 06:51.473
Well, this was delicious.

06:51.542 --> 06:53.775
Now we need to get back
home where we belong.

06:53.843 --> 06:57.251
Uh, we do just have a little
tradition here at Chez Murray.

06:57.276 --> 06:58.746
Um, every year after we finish dessert,

06:58.791 --> 07:01.143
we go around the table and
say what we're thankful for.

07:01.168 --> 07:02.768
Oh, that's not necessary, Clive.

07:02.793 --> 07:04.596
I'll start. Um...

07:05.135 --> 07:06.620
I am thankful

07:06.645 --> 07:09.540
to have two very
special women in my life.

07:09.565 --> 07:12.259
Eileen, you are every man's dream.

07:12.328 --> 07:13.527
Oh.

07:13.596 --> 07:15.163
And, Mother,

07:15.231 --> 07:17.351
you are every boy's dream.

07:19.843 --> 07:24.137
I'm thankful for my birth father.

07:25.274 --> 07:28.309
And I'm thankful for my school father,

07:28.377 --> 07:30.094
who's always looking after me,

07:30.119 --> 07:31.645
especially when my asthma acts up

07:31.714 --> 07:34.869
and I may need to skip
gym or have a free period.

07:34.908 --> 07:38.561
And I am thankful for Clive,

07:38.586 --> 07:40.477
for bringing us all together.

07:40.522 --> 07:43.785
You have a beautiful home, and
it's a pleasure to meet you.

07:43.810 --> 07:46.727
And I'm thankful this is over.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.129
Oh, Clive, I need you
to come by tomorrow

07:50.198 --> 07:52.532
and pull out the Christmas
decorations from the basement.

07:52.601 --> 07:54.900
I'll be damned if the
Protestants across the street

07:54.969 --> 07:56.736
will get their lights up before I do.

07:56.804 --> 07:58.471
Oh, I feel the same way.

07:58.540 --> 08:01.073
I know what you're doing.
You're trying to bond with me.

08:01.142 --> 08:02.709
Well, it won't work.

08:04.579 --> 08:06.511
Well...

08:06.580 --> 08:09.481
- time to go.
- I'm not going anywhere.

08:09.688 --> 08:11.717
I'm not leaving until
your mother likes me.

08:11.786 --> 08:12.985
That could take forever.

08:13.054 --> 08:14.297
Come on, Mom, it's Thanksgiving.

08:14.322 --> 08:15.921
Sit down!

08:15.990 --> 08:18.235
She goes German when she's angry.

08:20.613 --> 08:23.283
Mother is a very tough cookie.

08:23.308 --> 08:27.290
Actually, more like one of those
fossilized Civil War crackers

08:27.315 --> 08:29.533
that historians find in old barns.

08:29.558 --> 08:34.313
Maybe we should get her to
warm up to you on another day.

08:34.339 --> 08:36.470
Or... never.

08:36.495 --> 08:40.142
Clive, you don't get a second
chance to make a first impression.

08:40.167 --> 08:42.658
And my relationship with
Pat was doomed from the start

08:42.727 --> 08:45.776
partly because his mother
and I had a bad first meeting.

08:45.801 --> 08:48.331
What could possibly have
soured her opinion of you?

08:48.399 --> 08:50.566
I told her I was pregnant.

08:50.635 --> 08:52.784
Then I threw up on her.

08:52.972 --> 08:54.837
And I'm not gonna make
that same mistake again.

08:54.905 --> 08:58.517
I'm gonna get your mother to
like me the Eileen O'Neal way.

08:58.542 --> 09:01.844
I'm gonna scrub and shine my way
into that cold and lifeless heart.

09:01.869 --> 09:03.759
You think her heart is cold?

09:03.784 --> 09:05.513
Try feeling her feet under the covers.

09:05.582 --> 09:08.026
Uh, it was one time.

09:08.128 --> 09:10.151
- The power was out.
- Just stop.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.901
Hey, where would I find the salt?

09:15.745 --> 09:17.692
It's literally right next to your hand.

09:17.761 --> 09:19.472
Oh, there it is.

09:20.487 --> 09:22.462
And how about the pepper?

09:22.487 --> 09:24.098
It's attached to the salt.

09:24.167 --> 09:26.267
That's clever.

09:26.542 --> 09:28.251
Uh, do you have basil?

09:28.276 --> 09:30.805
Why would you put
basil on a sweet pota...

09:30.874 --> 09:34.134
Actually, yeah. Yeah, we do.

09:34.159 --> 09:36.142
You just have to cut it.

09:36.167 --> 09:38.545
It's just out there in the
garden. Go and help yourself.

09:38.614 --> 09:40.628
- B.R.B.
- Okay.

09:40.653 --> 09:41.682
Kenny.

09:41.751 --> 09:43.884
I just had this great
idea to create a fun, cute,

09:43.909 --> 09:45.579
little romantic moment
for me and Gloria.

09:45.604 --> 09:47.932
What is the name of
that song from that movie

09:47.957 --> 09:50.001
where they're cooking and they're
dancing? You know what I mean?

09:50.026 --> 09:51.769
- I don't... I don't know, Dad.
- Yes, you do know.

09:51.839 --> 09:53.353
It's... it's the one where
the guys are kind of...

09:53.378 --> 09:55.924
they're doing that. And the girls are...

09:55.949 --> 09:57.581
you know what I mean? That movie?

09:57.606 --> 09:59.950
With the... the...
the towel and the oven.

10:00.019 --> 10:01.986
Cher has a really nice
singing moment in "Mermaids."

10:02.054 --> 10:04.822
No, Kenny, this is some
movie I would go see.

10:04.890 --> 10:06.790
- Well, then...
- Shut up.

10:07.011 --> 10:08.401
It's coming.

10:09.229 --> 10:10.995
"Big Chill."

10:11.063 --> 10:13.370
- I knew I'd get it. Thanks, buddy.
- Ow.

10:13.395 --> 10:14.675
Okay.

10:15.503 --> 10:17.067
Looking good, guys.

10:17.136 --> 10:19.236
You know, Shannon and
I can finish this up.

10:19.261 --> 10:20.514
Why don't you and Jimmy
bring your mother's

10:20.539 --> 10:22.072
Christmas decorations
up from the basement?

10:22.141 --> 10:24.141
Oh. Come on, son.

10:24.209 --> 10:27.845
- You can be my helper elf.
- I am not your son or your elf.

10:27.913 --> 10:32.290
But I have been told I look like
a big Orlando Bloom, so okay.

10:34.588 --> 10:38.118
- What do I do with this?
- Uh, just, um, toss it.

10:42.427 --> 10:43.926
Okay.

10:43.995 --> 10:46.178
- Doesn't fit.
- Well, we'll make it fit.

10:50.272 --> 10:52.301
Oh, you're still here.

10:52.361 --> 10:54.405
You didn't throw away
my turkey bones, did you?

10:54.430 --> 10:55.630
I use them for soup.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.881
N... wouldn't dream of it.

10:57.906 --> 10:59.876
Soup sounds fantastic.

11:02.438 --> 11:03.780
Pull it out and reform it.

11:09.594 --> 11:11.687
- Hello.
- Hi. When are you coming home?

11:11.755 --> 11:13.522
We should be at number 7
on the checklist by now,

11:13.547 --> 11:14.523
and I'm only at number 3.

11:14.592 --> 11:16.158
You are way behind.

11:16.227 --> 11:17.978
I know. It's like a zoo in here...

11:18.003 --> 11:19.252
literally.

11:19.297 --> 11:21.730
I don't even have anywhere
to put the chive butter.

11:21.755 --> 11:22.864
Kenny, breathe.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.312
You've watched me do this for years.

11:25.337 --> 11:26.501
You can handle it.

11:26.526 --> 11:29.054
But Gloria used all of my mushrooms.

11:29.079 --> 11:31.539
How am I supposed to make mushroom
stuffing without mushrooms?

11:31.608 --> 11:33.993
I can't do this. It's
just... it's too overwhelming.

11:34.018 --> 11:36.610
Toughen up, Kenneth.
Don't be a stereotype.

11:38.000 --> 11:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:47.468 --> 11:49.824
Okay, girl. You got this.

11:52.395 --> 11:55.239
Antonia Lofaso, Graham
Elliot, and Alex Guarnaschelli?

11:55.264 --> 11:56.583
What are you guys doing here?

11:56.608 --> 11:58.874
I'm, like, a huge fan of you guys.

11:58.899 --> 12:00.868
Aw, that is very sweet, Kenny,

12:00.893 --> 12:02.232
but you have five minutes

12:02.257 --> 12:04.605
to create an entire Thanksgiving meal,

12:04.673 --> 12:06.040
and your time starts now.

12:06.065 --> 12:07.608
- Let's go.
- Right.

12:07.633 --> 12:09.877
Guys, the only things
he has in his cabinet

12:09.902 --> 12:12.879
are pancake mix, bamboo
shoots, and Froot Loops.

12:12.904 --> 12:15.017
This is gonna be a total disaster.

12:15.042 --> 12:16.985
I'm super excited.

12:17.017 --> 12:19.263
All right, so already, he's
thinking outside of the box.

12:19.288 --> 12:20.844
He does not have any bread crumbs,

12:20.869 --> 12:23.211
so it's amazing to watch him
grinding up these Froot Loops

12:23.236 --> 12:24.758
into like a panko breading.

12:24.783 --> 12:26.926
Froot Loops obviously
don't taste like panko,

12:26.951 --> 12:28.419
- but it's a similar mouthfeel.
- Mm-hmm.

12:28.496 --> 12:30.529
My family's going through
a lot of changes lately.

12:30.598 --> 12:32.600
- Um, my parents are getting a divorce.
- _

12:32.625 --> 12:34.634
They both invited dates
to Thanksgiving dinner.

12:34.702 --> 12:36.202
And my mom is...

12:36.742 --> 12:40.373
She's not even here, and we
usually do this together, so...

12:40.441 --> 12:42.047
I'm sorry.

12:42.343 --> 12:45.055
I guess, in a way, you could
say I'm doing this for her.

12:45.613 --> 12:47.112
Just to be clear, she's still alive.

12:47.188 --> 12:49.492
I want to win on the
taste, not sympathy.

12:52.219 --> 12:54.969
Bamboo shoots have the
same mouthfeel as mushrooms.

12:54.994 --> 12:56.649
Thanks, Antonia.

12:59.994 --> 13:01.607
Hey, there's the box with the wreaths.

13:01.632 --> 13:03.102
Why don't you hand
that to me, and I'll...

13:03.127 --> 13:05.027
put it on the pile going outside.

13:08.402 --> 13:10.402
Hey, Jimmy, I know this is hard on you.

13:10.470 --> 13:12.570
You're a sensitive soul like myself.

13:12.639 --> 13:14.472
But if you have something to say,

13:14.541 --> 13:16.474
I am no longer your vice principal.

13:16.543 --> 13:20.045
I'm upset because the
thought of anyone...

13:20.070 --> 13:23.682
getting down with my mom is unsettling.

13:23.750 --> 13:28.653
Well, if it helps, we have
not gotten down... yet.

13:28.722 --> 13:31.397
- We have necked.
- No, that does not help.

13:32.506 --> 13:33.958
Is that an air hockey table?

13:34.027 --> 13:35.459
Oh, yeah. You play?

13:35.528 --> 13:36.527
Yeah.

13:36.595 --> 13:38.296
You want to take it for a spin?

13:38.364 --> 13:39.803
Maybe.

13:40.333 --> 13:41.498
If we can make it interesting.

13:41.567 --> 13:43.061
Sing along while we play?

13:43.086 --> 13:44.661
No, that's... nope.

13:44.686 --> 13:46.551
I was thinking like a bet.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.372
How about if I beat you,

13:48.441 --> 13:50.273
you have to stop trying to bond with me?

13:50.343 --> 13:53.344
Well, okay. You got yourself a deal.

13:53.630 --> 13:56.164
It's time for air hockey.

13:57.626 --> 13:58.692
It's halftime.

13:58.717 --> 14:00.283
Thought I'd open the wine I brought.

14:00.353 --> 14:02.118
I just need to grab an opener.

14:03.689 --> 14:04.988
Um...

14:06.424 --> 14:09.960
um, can you just indicate
where it is with your eyes?

14:15.968 --> 14:17.998
Oh, God, no. No, no, no.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.255
What's happening?

14:23.281 --> 14:25.039
Oh, Lord.

14:25.850 --> 14:27.016
Hey.

14:27.078 --> 14:28.644
Hey.

14:28.713 --> 14:30.312
- Who's cooking?
- Oh, yes.

14:30.382 --> 14:32.047
I don't know what's happening,

14:32.116 --> 14:33.583
but it feels very white.

14:34.986 --> 14:37.253
Oh, Kenny.

14:40.224 --> 14:41.490
Why are you even in here?

14:41.558 --> 14:43.558
I mean, you never helped Mom cook once.

14:43.627 --> 14:45.061
And suddenly you're wearing cologne

14:45.086 --> 14:48.430
and... and... and you're kitchen
dancing to try to impress your date.

14:48.686 --> 14:50.436
This is a date?

14:52.069 --> 14:53.435
Yes?

14:53.504 --> 14:55.204
Oh.

14:55.273 --> 14:57.240
Oh.

15:00.778 --> 15:02.010
Mr. Pickles!

15:04.481 --> 15:06.748
- What was in this bowl?
- Chive butter.

15:06.817 --> 15:08.203
Chives are poisonous to cats.

15:08.228 --> 15:10.519
Why would you put poison
in Mr. Pickles' dining room?

15:10.587 --> 15:12.609
Th-that's his dining room?

15:12.634 --> 15:15.836
Yes! It goes bedroom, living
room, guest room, dining room.

15:15.861 --> 15:18.059
It's an entertainer's layout.

15:21.097 --> 15:22.117
Where are you going?

15:22.142 --> 15:24.933
Oh, I was just looking for the
rest of your cleaning supplies.

15:25.001 --> 15:27.568
- We used up all the Windex.
- Don't go in there.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.982
Why? Is it Clive's old bedroom?

15:30.007 --> 15:32.176
Does he have a lot of
embarrassing posters on the walls?

15:32.201 --> 15:33.297
Oh, no, don't...

15:33.342 --> 15:34.408
uh...

15:34.477 --> 15:35.509
Hello.

15:36.589 --> 15:38.211
Did you bring the cranberry sauce?

15:39.030 --> 15:41.042
45. Still going!

15:44.280 --> 15:46.318
- Who is this?
- Gary.

15:46.343 --> 15:48.137
Gary is my handyman.

15:48.162 --> 15:52.079
So, then why is Clive coming here
tomorrow to put up your storm windows?

15:52.148 --> 15:54.515
- I'm not very handy.
- Fine.

15:54.584 --> 15:57.506
I just use him for the man part.

15:57.687 --> 15:59.372
We're lovers... two years.

15:59.397 --> 16:01.455
Clive doesn't know. It would crush him.

16:01.523 --> 16:04.248
The secrecy keeps things exciting.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.728
So, that's why you were rushing us
out of here and being so rude to me.

16:07.796 --> 16:10.115
Yes to the first.

16:10.631 --> 16:12.900
Eileen, if you really
want me to like you,

16:12.969 --> 16:15.975
then do not tell Clive about Gary.

16:18.940 --> 16:20.374
All right, then.

16:20.442 --> 16:22.576
But I want something in return.

16:22.644 --> 16:25.442
You will be pleasant
to me when I see you.

16:25.467 --> 16:28.106
You will pay me three
compliments per visit.

16:28.131 --> 16:33.030
And once a month, we have coffee.

16:33.221 --> 16:37.656
Two compliments, and
we'll say we had coffee.

16:38.088 --> 16:39.592
Deal.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.038
It all comes down to this.

16:42.063 --> 16:44.931
One more point, and you
are out of my life forever.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.944
Unless I score seven consecutive points,

16:47.969 --> 16:50.478
the biggest comeback in air...

16:50.900 --> 16:53.138
Yes! O'Neal! Whoo!

16:53.207 --> 16:56.432
I think you're very good. I've
only ever played this with Mother.

16:56.807 --> 16:59.111
It's been nice getting to know
you over this brief period of time.

16:59.179 --> 17:02.681
Um, from here on in,
I'll stay out of your way.

17:02.750 --> 17:04.650
Yeah, good.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.483
- Good.
- Okay.

17:06.553 --> 17:09.186
- Best two out of three?
- You are on like "Donkey Kong."

17:09.256 --> 17:12.817
Which is another game I have
somewhere in this basement.

17:12.842 --> 17:14.592
Is that it over there?

17:14.661 --> 17:16.289
Whoo!

17:16.596 --> 17:19.696
I'm sorry Gloria didn't
know you guys were on a date.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.178
And that I saw you dancing.

17:23.194 --> 17:27.204
Well, listen, you were right.
I never did that stuff with Mom.

17:27.272 --> 17:31.709
And that was because she really
took charge a lot of the time.

17:31.778 --> 17:34.958
I guess after a while, I
just kind of stopped trying.

17:34.983 --> 17:36.600
I get that.

17:36.625 --> 17:39.616
Just the next time you're trying
to reinvent yourself, maybe...

17:39.685 --> 17:42.255
maybe you don't do it
on a national holiday.

17:42.280 --> 17:43.889
That's fair.

17:44.390 --> 17:46.157
The tie and the cologne
are kind of nice.

17:46.225 --> 17:47.374
Well, thank you very much.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.693
That means a lot coming
from you because you're gay.

17:49.762 --> 17:50.794
Okay.

17:51.374 --> 17:54.397
Just another couple of hours while
they pump Mr. Pickles' little stomach.

17:54.422 --> 17:55.632
But he's gonna be okay.

17:55.701 --> 17:58.168
He didn't die on my
watch. Suck it, Dwayne!

17:59.572 --> 18:01.472
It was really nice to meet you.

18:01.497 --> 18:04.130
Oh, the pleasure was all mine.

18:04.155 --> 18:08.545
- And...?
- You have nice hair, clean teeth.

18:08.614 --> 18:10.914
We should have coffee.
That should suffice.

18:10.983 --> 18:12.748
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

18:13.070 --> 18:14.903
Oh, Clive. Don't forget.

18:14.936 --> 18:16.519
Tomorrow, the storm windows,

18:16.588 --> 18:19.322
and Saturday, I need you
to clean the roof gutters.

18:19.347 --> 18:22.592
Oh, I can't this weekend.
I'm running a 5K for charity.

18:22.660 --> 18:23.693
Oh.

18:23.761 --> 18:25.761
Well, maybe I can do it myself.

18:25.830 --> 18:27.196
Just hope I don't fall.

18:27.221 --> 18:29.331
No, I'm a bad son.

18:29.356 --> 18:33.168
I'll withdraw from the race
and clean your gutters instead.

18:33.237 --> 18:36.266
A lot of those whales can
probably just save themselves.

18:36.305 --> 18:40.891
Victoria, don't you have a handyman
who could clean your gutters for you?

18:41.266 --> 18:42.945
No, I don't.

18:43.014 --> 18:44.516
Are you sure?

18:45.002 --> 18:46.268
Quite.

18:47.906 --> 18:49.172
Your mother has a lover,

18:49.197 --> 18:51.452
and I found him eating
turkey in the spare room.

18:51.477 --> 18:52.679
Oh!

18:52.704 --> 18:54.679
So you don't have night terrors.

18:54.704 --> 18:56.302
That's just the sound
of your lovemaking.

18:56.327 --> 18:58.727
You're right, that is unsettling.

18:58.795 --> 19:00.095
I'm unsettled.

19:00.164 --> 19:01.763
For two years she's been catting around

19:01.788 --> 19:03.798
with a drifter named Gary.

19:03.867 --> 19:05.579
I thought you wanted me to like you.

19:05.604 --> 19:08.269
Well, I'm dating Clive, and it's
more important that he likes me

19:08.338 --> 19:10.960
and that we build our
relationship on truth.

19:10.985 --> 19:12.440
In the spirit of honesty,

19:12.509 --> 19:15.000
we fished your turkey
carcass out of the trash.

19:15.110 --> 19:17.914
So don't make soup out of
it because it's not sanitary.

19:18.204 --> 19:20.814
- Mm, thanks for that.
- Oh, instead of changing the batteries

19:20.883 --> 19:22.316
out of your smoke detectors next month,

19:22.385 --> 19:23.751
I'm booking an Alaskan cruise.

19:23.819 --> 19:26.620
Oh, and, Gary, you can
go [bleep] yourself, bro.

19:26.689 --> 19:28.756
Oh.

19:33.688 --> 19:35.366
Oh, hey, guys.

19:35.391 --> 19:38.165
Your dad and I wanted to apologize.

19:38.233 --> 19:40.000
Yesterday was kind of a mess.

19:40.069 --> 19:43.571
Yes, we... Maybe
Thanksgiving isn't for dates.

19:43.639 --> 19:45.172
- We're still new to this.
- Yeah.

19:45.240 --> 19:46.562
No, we get it.

19:46.609 --> 19:50.202
So, what's for Black Friday breakfast?

19:50.976 --> 19:53.780
I have some leftover turkey and
potatoes. I could make us a hash.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.415
I'll help.

19:55.484 --> 19:58.569
Mm. You know what? I got this.

19:58.912 --> 20:00.537
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:00.562 --> 20:04.787
I can make us some
cranberry pancakes, too.

20:04.826 --> 20:06.952
- Yes.
- Ow!

20:07.366 --> 20:09.829
Sometimes, when you get
rid of old traditions,

20:09.898 --> 20:11.831
you make room for new ones.

20:11.900 --> 20:14.177
No matter where life takes us,

20:14.202 --> 20:17.103
we will always have
Thanksgiving dinner together

20:17.171 --> 20:18.771
on Friday morning.

20:23.584 --> 20:28.193
Uh, Chefs, today I have
for you a braised pork belly

20:28.218 --> 20:31.352
with pickled radishes
and a miso and soy broth.

20:32.216 --> 20:35.260
So, Kenny, this tastes like a good idea

20:35.329 --> 20:37.528
that was eaten by a bad idea

20:37.597 --> 20:39.831
and then was thrown
up by a terrible idea.

20:39.899 --> 20:41.404
Thank you, Chef.

20:41.429 --> 20:44.068
It's so terrible. I
mean, it makes me angry.

20:44.093 --> 20:46.271
Like, really angry, like I
want to punch it, wrestle it,

20:46.296 --> 20:48.473
throw it against a wall, punch it again.

20:48.541 --> 20:50.740
- It's bad.
- Thank you, Chef.

20:50.966 --> 20:55.748
This is overseasoned, overdone,
overcooked, and underwhelming.

20:56.282 --> 21:00.005
Thank you, Chef. All good notes.

21:00.185 --> 21:03.520
Um, does this mean I'm
going on to the next round?

Can you just tell me?

21:16.217 --> 21:17.406
Kenny, you know how this goes.

21:17.431 --> 21:18.735
We have to go to a commercial break.

21:18.804 --> 21:21.371
Right. Cool. Cool.
