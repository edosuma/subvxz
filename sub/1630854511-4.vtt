00:06.208 --> 00:08.666
Someone just concisely recap
everything I missed.

00:11.250 --> 00:13.458
- <i>What happened to them?</i>
- <i>Possession.</i>

00:16.750 --> 00:18.500
Countless more will die.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.416
But you can still save them.

00:20.416 --> 00:23.750
All you have to do is submit.

00:24.416 --> 00:26.291
<i>Indestructible magic armor.</i>

00:26.291 --> 00:29.416
<i>I can't believe I let you sucker me
into something so ridiculous.</i>

00:29.416 --> 00:31.583
<i>You know,
the Cuirass isn't a weapon.</i>

00:31.583 --> 00:33.458
<i>- It's a shield.</i>
- <i>Against what?</i>

00:35.750 --> 00:36.750
Darkness.

00:38.250 --> 00:40.083
<i>A portal between dimensions
is opening.</i>

00:40.083 --> 00:42.333
And when they reach it,
Elora will be lost.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.458
<i>Avagdu!</i>

00:59.958 --> 01:01.041
<i>Graydon's hurt!</i>

01:01.041 --> 01:02.958
<i>We have to get him to shelter!</i>

01:05.958 --> 01:07.250
Nockmaar.

01:46.666 --> 01:48.291
Here, let me help you.

01:48.291 --> 01:49.708
We can't go in.

01:49.708 --> 01:51.916
Don't you see? This is what she wants.

01:51.916 --> 01:54.416
We have to get Graydon inside
or he'll die.

01:54.416 --> 01:55.791
He's not the only one.

01:55.791 --> 01:57.708
There's nothin' around here for leagues.

01:57.708 --> 01:59.500
This fortress was the stronghold

01:59.500 --> 02:03.291
of the most brutal tyrant
of her age, Bavmorda.

02:03.291 --> 02:06.625
Yeah. Or as Kit calls her, Grandma.

02:08.333 --> 02:09.416
<i>There's more.</i>

02:11.458 --> 02:14.875
<i>It won't be easy to hear this,
but you must.</i>

02:18.125 --> 02:23.541
<i>Bavmorda's blood, her spirit, survived.</i>

02:24.625 --> 02:27.583
<i>In me, in your brother, and in you.</i>

02:47.625 --> 02:48.625
Sorry about this, pal.

02:51.291 --> 02:53.333
What do you think she used these for?

02:53.333 --> 02:55.000
Bavmorda knew how to romp.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.333
Legendary parties.

02:57.041 --> 02:58.500
Three, four days in a row.

02:58.500 --> 02:59.958
All kinds of weird shit.

03:01.958 --> 03:03.416
How do I look?

03:03.416 --> 03:05.500
Like a vermathrax at a vestal faire.

03:06.083 --> 03:07.625
- What?
- I was...

03:07.625 --> 03:09.375
No, it was a really good joke.

03:09.375 --> 03:12.583
Next time leave the levity to me.

03:13.958 --> 03:17.041
What happened to Ballantine and Merrick
is gonna happen to me.

03:18.333 --> 03:20.791
And you guys
are gonna have to stop me before I...

03:25.125 --> 03:26.125
What?

03:26.666 --> 03:28.750
What was Ballantine gonna do to me?

03:28.750 --> 03:31.041
What Bavmorda started
when you were a baby.

03:32.708 --> 03:34.250
The Ritual of the Thirteenth Night.

03:35.291 --> 03:39.500
Banishing your soul
to a realm of perpetual suffering.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.833
Only the combined strength
of Willow and Raziel,

03:42.833 --> 03:46.791
the two most powerful sorcerers
of all time, was able to stop it.

03:47.958 --> 03:51.333
In the end, using the Fibonacci Hex,
if I'm not mistaken, right?

03:51.333 --> 03:52.541
Hmm.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.125
Willow obliterated Bavmorda,

03:55.125 --> 03:57.916
rescued Elora Danan, you,

03:59.583 --> 04:00.666
and saved the world.

04:00.666 --> 04:01.750
Wow.

04:02.416 --> 04:03.833
Then what'd you do?

04:03.833 --> 04:05.416
We all went out and got pissed.

04:08.583 --> 04:13.000
And that thing that you did
at The Slaughtered Lamb, could you...

04:14.041 --> 04:15.708
Blast his insides out?

04:16.833 --> 04:20.041
A few moments of the most
excruciating pain ever endured,

04:20.041 --> 04:21.625
promptly followed by death.

04:21.625 --> 04:24.291
All right, well, could've just said no.

04:25.708 --> 04:27.375
This is all your fault.

04:28.708 --> 04:30.250
Sorry,
how'd you figure that?

04:30.250 --> 04:31.500
Well...

04:31.500 --> 04:34.541
You sent us on a wild goose chase
to find some stupid artifact.

04:34.541 --> 04:35.958
And it doesn't even exist.

04:35.958 --> 04:38.958
We're trapped in some cursed castle,
and Airk is still half a world...

04:38.958 --> 04:40.625
Right, Airk, your brother.

04:40.625 --> 04:43.166
And meanwhile,
your fiancé, Grayoncé there,

04:43.166 --> 04:45.000
is being ravaged by a 300-year-old demon.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.083
Come on, man.

04:46.541 --> 04:48.125
- Don't say ravaged.
- Sorry, bud.

05:10.708 --> 05:12.458
How long does he have?

05:13.208 --> 05:14.333
Before it takes hold?

05:15.166 --> 05:16.208
Not long.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
Sometime in the small hours of the night,
he'll lose control.

05:29.958 --> 05:31.875
I mean, we all know it has to be done.

05:35.458 --> 05:37.958
What was the last thing
that Ballantine asked you to do?

05:40.041 --> 05:41.041
Kill him.

05:43.583 --> 05:45.833
He's the prince of Galladoorn, Kit,
we'd be at war.

05:45.833 --> 05:47.416
Hastur knew.

05:47.416 --> 05:49.708
Right? We all knew
that he never should've come.

05:51.666 --> 05:53.791
And if I have to decide
between saving Airk

05:53.791 --> 05:56.791
and waiting for Graydon
to turn into some kinda monster...

05:56.791 --> 05:58.916
Hey, you should
put that in your wedding vows.

05:59.583 --> 06:00.875
Kit's right.

06:00.875 --> 06:03.416
I've had some experience with this before

06:03.416 --> 06:06.458
and I know
I'm not strong enough to stop it.

06:07.625 --> 06:09.125
I don't wanna hurt you guys.

06:11.041 --> 06:12.125
But I will.

06:12.791 --> 06:15.625
If Her Highness
is in such a hurry to see it done,

06:16.333 --> 06:17.458
she ought to do it herself.

06:19.291 --> 06:20.583
Oh, you don't think I will?

06:22.500 --> 06:23.791
Uh, I don't.

06:25.916 --> 06:28.375
Killin' someone
who isn't tryin' to kill you back,

06:29.833 --> 06:31.208
it's not an easy thing to do.

06:32.833 --> 06:34.958
Please.

06:34.958 --> 06:37.458
You're the greatest sorcerer alive.

06:37.458 --> 06:39.750
You obliterated Bavmorda.

06:40.416 --> 06:43.583
I mean,
there must be something you can do.

06:46.708 --> 06:48.500
When she was young, your age,

06:49.875 --> 06:53.958
Bavmorda was bright,
curious, full of promise.

06:55.666 --> 06:58.750
She was abducted by members
of a secret long-forgotten sect,

06:59.625 --> 07:00.791
The Order of the Wyrm.

07:06.083 --> 07:07.625
The Crone radicalized her,

07:07.625 --> 07:13.041
converting her with their warped beliefs,
and gifting her with unnatural powers.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.250
What kind of powers?

07:15.291 --> 07:16.458
Well, for example,

07:16.458 --> 07:19.250
she once changed
the entire Galladoorn army into pigs.

07:21.666 --> 07:24.208
Raziel and I, eventually,
changed them all back.

07:24.208 --> 07:26.208
It was chaos, pigs everywhere.

07:26.208 --> 07:28.208
Sorry, all of them?

07:28.583 --> 07:29.583
Huh?

07:30.166 --> 07:33.208
You... You turned all of the pigs
back into people?

07:34.375 --> 07:35.375
Think so.

07:42.916 --> 07:47.541
The point is, the Order of the Wyrm
practiced taboo magic, against nature.

07:47.541 --> 07:50.416
If a rite exists
that can extract that kind of evil,

07:51.208 --> 07:52.958
I think I know where we'd find it.

07:54.625 --> 07:55.750
The Malatrium.

07:56.458 --> 07:57.875
Bound in the skin of a satyr.

07:57.875 --> 07:59.125
Gross.

08:07.291 --> 08:09.791
Here, The Purgation of Namshub.

08:09.791 --> 08:11.958
Hey, that's my favorite purgation.

08:11.958 --> 08:14.666
It's a ritual of throwing, of casting out.

08:14.666 --> 08:19.000
But, it's complicated and dangerous,
and I'm not yet back to my full strength.

08:21.166 --> 08:23.291
I couldn't even say the seed spell.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.000
No. Okay.

08:28.083 --> 08:29.250
What do you want me to do?

08:29.250 --> 08:30.791
Call it an introduction to alchemy.

08:30.791 --> 08:32.375
We're gonna make a salve.

08:33.666 --> 08:34.708
Very potent.

08:35.541 --> 08:37.916
A precise mixture of herbs,
tonics, and tinctures,

08:37.916 --> 08:41.625
applied at the proper time
while the purgation is read aloud

08:43.333 --> 08:45.125
and his fluids drained.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.833
What kind of fluids are we draining?

08:46.833 --> 08:48.625
Blood, pus, discharge from...

08:48.625 --> 08:50.875
On second thought, surprise me.

08:50.875 --> 08:54.416
Go to the armory, fetch me a dagger
with an ivory handle and selenium blade.

09:09.916 --> 09:11.458
The Crone knows we're here.

09:11.458 --> 09:14.000
She'll send her Gales
to ensure the ritual is completed.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.250
We'll need to keep watch.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.458
I can do that.

09:17.125 --> 09:19.791
We can't allow Graydon's infection
to pass to any of us.

09:19.791 --> 09:22.541
If it does,
we won't get out of here alive.

09:22.541 --> 09:25.750
How contagious are you talking,
like if he coughs on us?

09:25.750 --> 09:28.791
Or if I touch him and then I,
you know, touch my face or...

09:28.791 --> 09:30.125
The vermiscus goo.

09:30.791 --> 09:32.708
Don't sniff it,
don't wipe it, don't eat it.

09:32.708 --> 09:34.208
Why would we eat it?

09:34.208 --> 09:35.291
Wait!

09:35.291 --> 09:37.958
There's one thing
even more important than that.

09:37.958 --> 09:40.250
No matter what,
stay out of the High Tower.

09:40.916 --> 09:44.083
It's maybe,
probably a portal to the Netherworld.

09:45.250 --> 09:47.958
Okay, don't touch the evil goo,
stay out of the High Tower.

09:47.958 --> 09:49.041
Everybody got that?

09:49.041 --> 09:52.291
I'm feelin' really energized
and optimistic about this exorcism.

10:06.208 --> 10:08.458
Hey, I know you're hurting

10:09.083 --> 10:10.916
but you can't keep punishing yourself

10:10.916 --> 10:12.583
for doing what you had to.

10:12.583 --> 10:17.458
I know what he meant to you,
and how hard it was to, you know...

10:17.458 --> 10:18.541
Kill him?

10:20.541 --> 10:21.625
Yeah.

10:22.666 --> 10:24.625
Kit, Boorman's right.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.958
It's not something
that you can understand until you do it.

10:28.583 --> 10:29.708
I hope you never have to.

10:35.875 --> 10:39.333
All I remember about bein' a kid
is mucking stables,

10:39.333 --> 10:41.250
and mendin' bridles and bits.

10:42.458 --> 10:46.083
And I was grateful,
grateful to Sorsha for giving me a home.

10:46.083 --> 10:50.750
But when Ballantine took an interest,
he gave me something that I'd never had,

10:50.750 --> 10:54.625
a way to use my anger,
to channel it into becoming something.

10:58.208 --> 11:01.666
He gave me his sword
and I killed him with it.

11:02.250 --> 11:03.291
I know. I...

11:03.291 --> 11:06.083
I'm goin' to the battlements
to keep watch.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.166
I'll come with you.

11:07.166 --> 11:10.416
Just help Willow and Elora
gather what they need.

11:30.875 --> 11:31.916
Sorry.

11:52.333 --> 11:53.333
Ah.

12:05.583 --> 12:07.125
Oh, hello, lovely.

12:07.791 --> 12:09.791
What treasures are you hiding?

12:24.875 --> 12:25.875
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:32.208 --> 12:34.166
<i>Boorman.</i>

12:38.083 --> 12:40.750
<i>Come to us.</i>

12:51.291 --> 12:53.791
Is there anything
that we can give him for the pain?

12:53.791 --> 12:55.208
No.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.291
Oh, okay then.

12:57.208 --> 13:01.166
I found everything
except for essence of nightshade.

13:02.791 --> 13:04.500
We can't leave out ingredients.

13:04.500 --> 13:07.083
Mix it wrong,
we could blow up the whole castle.

13:07.208 --> 13:09.291
Brined possum bladder.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.916
Red-throated possums
eat nothing but nightshade.

13:14.708 --> 13:17.500
Cook down its spleen
and <i>voilà,</i> essence of.

13:18.166 --> 13:19.750
Is that what you put in your muffins?

13:21.125 --> 13:23.333
Among other things.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.375
Can you just go
and check if they have any?

13:25.375 --> 13:28.458
You think that's something
people just have in their cupboards?

13:34.625 --> 13:36.041
Worth a shot, right?

13:38.916 --> 13:41.500
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey! Come on!
- Relax.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.666
- Is that part of...
- No.

13:49.333 --> 13:51.166
I was sick, when I was a kid.

13:51.166 --> 13:52.416
With what?

13:52.416 --> 13:53.625
I don't know, exactly.

13:53.625 --> 13:57.458
Just something bad.

13:57.458 --> 13:59.083
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

13:59.083 --> 14:00.375
It's shameful.

14:00.375 --> 14:02.458
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

14:03.250 --> 14:05.208
It just means you're resilient, is all.

14:05.208 --> 14:07.083
We're gonna fix you right up.

14:07.083 --> 14:09.916
But this might hurt a little.

14:13.166 --> 14:14.458
Or a lot.

14:32.416 --> 14:33.541
Nope.

14:34.166 --> 14:36.166
Yeah.

14:37.208 --> 14:38.416
"Go ahead, Kit.

14:38.416 --> 14:42.083
"Fetch me some brined possum bladder,
and some pixie dust

14:42.083 --> 14:44.916
"so I can sprinkle it on my bum

14:44.916 --> 14:47.750
"and make my gentle wind
smell like cinnamon."

14:50.166 --> 14:51.166
Hi.

14:52.083 --> 14:53.083
Hello.

14:54.583 --> 14:56.000
What are you doing here?

14:57.208 --> 15:00.125
You didn't find any eel jelly
or nymph butter, did you?

15:00.125 --> 15:03.500
Um, aren't you supposed
to be watchin' out for the Gales?

15:03.500 --> 15:04.875
I am. I was. I...

15:04.875 --> 15:06.416
There's this door that I've found

15:06.416 --> 15:09.083
and it looks like
a great spot for watching.

15:10.875 --> 15:13.291
Boorman, are you plundering
my dead grandma's castle?

15:13.958 --> 15:15.625
No, of course not!

15:15.625 --> 15:16.791
I don't care if you are.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.375
Oh. Okay, in that case, 100% yes.

15:19.375 --> 15:21.083
Everyone thinks this place is cursed.

15:21.083 --> 15:22.666
Do you know how rare it is

15:22.666 --> 15:25.541
to find an abandoned castle
that hasn't been sacked?

15:26.541 --> 15:27.750
Guess not.

15:27.750 --> 15:29.250
I can't open the treasure vault,

15:29.250 --> 15:31.583
which is very frustrating...

15:31.583 --> 15:33.083
Thank you.

15:34.083 --> 15:35.375
What are you lookin' for?

15:36.083 --> 15:37.500
Brined possum bladder.

15:38.875 --> 15:40.000
Ah.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.333
You can never find it when you need it.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.250
How's the, uh, purgation going?

15:45.375 --> 15:47.958
It's not gonna work.

15:49.500 --> 15:52.416
And if this ritual doesn't kill him,
I'll have to.

15:53.083 --> 15:54.083
Uh-huh.

15:54.625 --> 15:55.708
What?

15:56.291 --> 15:57.458
Nothing,

15:58.458 --> 16:02.416
I just think Bavmorda would be very proud
of her granddaughter right now.

16:12.291 --> 16:13.958
Oh, my God.

16:17.291 --> 16:19.458
And she'll never let me forget it.

16:23.000 --> 16:32.708
<i>Gashog ba-sog tarong amach!</i>

16:33.916 --> 16:35.166
Elora.

16:36.208 --> 16:38.666
This won't work
if you don't say it with me.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.166
Okay.

16:45.166 --> 16:50.041
<i>Gashog ba-sog tarong amach!</i>

16:50.041 --> 16:51.958
<i>- Amach.
- Amach?</i>

16:51.958 --> 16:53.041
Hard "K" sound.

16:53.041 --> 16:54.708
<i>Amach?</i>

16:55.375 --> 16:56.375
Perfect.

16:59.833 --> 17:02.833
<i>Gashog ba-sog tarong amach!</i>

17:03.958 --> 17:10.291
<i>Gashog ba-sog tarong amach!</i>

17:10.291 --> 17:12.500
Look at me. Look at me, boy.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.625
- What? No. You're not here.
- You're such a failure.

17:16.625 --> 17:18.166
You're not real.

17:18.916 --> 17:20.041
What did I tell you?

17:20.708 --> 17:23.458
Give Galladoorn an heir
with a claim to Tir Asleen.

17:24.125 --> 17:26.625
Redeem yourself
for what you stole from me.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.208
It wasn't me!

17:28.875 --> 17:30.375
It's okay.

17:30.375 --> 17:32.125
You can do this.

17:32.916 --> 17:34.666
And I'll catch you if you fall.

17:35.333 --> 17:36.916
Why are you torturing me?

17:40.250 --> 17:42.666
- What's happening to him?
- Keep stirring!

17:42.666 --> 17:44.083
Damn it, where's Kit?

18:17.916 --> 18:22.666
<i>Do you renounce your name,
your family?</i>

18:22.666 --> 18:24.000
<i>I do.</i>

18:24.000 --> 18:28.833
<i>Will you embrace the light
of the Eternal One?</i>

18:28.833 --> 18:31.791
<i>Pledge your life to our endeavor,</i>

18:31.791 --> 18:36.083
<i>that we might deliver
this world from suffering,</i>

18:36.083 --> 18:40.166
<i>into his warm embrace?</i>

18:40.166 --> 18:41.250
<i>I will.</i>

18:41.750 --> 18:46.041
<i>The Blood of the Six runs in your veins.</i>

18:46.208 --> 18:49.208
<i>You shall be his harbinger.</i>

18:50.333 --> 18:53.625
<i>Primal Priestess of the Wyrm,</i>

18:53.625 --> 18:57.000
<i>Queen Bavmorda.</i>

19:08.041 --> 19:09.291
Ugh.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.541
Door, you won't defeat me. I...

19:34.791 --> 19:37.125
Hey, you think spoiled wine
can make you...

19:37.833 --> 19:38.833
What?

19:38.833 --> 19:42.041
I'm tryin' to get this damn
treasure vault open, and it's killing me.

19:42.041 --> 19:43.791
I really need to know what's in there.

19:43.791 --> 19:45.541
What if it's something really good like

19:45.541 --> 19:48.833
a giant golden statue
of an eagle fighting a horse?

19:51.916 --> 19:53.125
You see anything?

19:53.708 --> 19:54.833
No.

19:56.250 --> 19:57.583
Kit's right, you know?

19:57.583 --> 19:59.291
One of us is gonna have to kill him.

20:01.291 --> 20:02.375
Probably.

20:03.583 --> 20:05.625
And it's gonna have to be
either you or me.

20:06.791 --> 20:08.083
Yeah.

20:08.833 --> 20:12.625
Ugh! All I ever wanted to be
was a knight, to serve.

20:14.666 --> 20:15.958
So far, I hate it.

20:28.958 --> 20:30.541
You know, when my partner died,

20:32.583 --> 20:34.708
I spent a lot of time running from myself,

20:36.125 --> 20:41.750
till I realized the only person
I'll never get away from is me.

20:42.833 --> 20:44.041
How'd you live with it?

20:46.041 --> 20:51.333
You set your eyes on what you want,
you go for it, and you don't look back.

20:54.875 --> 20:57.708
And I think
Ballantine would've said the same.

21:04.375 --> 21:06.500
All right, that's...

21:07.291 --> 21:10.250
Everyone deserves one good cry per quest.

21:16.375 --> 21:19.500
Ugh.

21:21.666 --> 21:24.458
Look, if you're gonna get grossed out,
or faint, or something,

21:24.458 --> 21:26.833
can you just
take a few steps back, please?

21:28.125 --> 21:29.208
Amateur.

21:50.833 --> 21:51.833
Elora, quickly.

21:58.041 --> 21:59.166
Good.

21:59.333 --> 22:00.791
Ugh! That is foul.

22:01.458 --> 22:04.208
It's not honeysuckle,
but I think that means it's ready.

22:11.125 --> 22:12.291
Maybe he won't even feel it.

22:22.583 --> 22:25.791
<i>Yug shoggog yug sugloth...</i>

22:26.708 --> 22:30.125
<i>Yug shoggog el katuth...</i>

22:33.166 --> 22:35.125
Give me some water, peck.

22:35.125 --> 22:36.500
Or you die.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.375
Understand? Water.

22:38.375 --> 22:39.833
Elora, water.

22:41.333 --> 22:42.333
Hurry up!

22:55.375 --> 22:56.791
Is somebody there?

22:57.791 --> 22:59.291
Can anyone hear me?

22:59.291 --> 23:02.666
If you can, please, talk to me.

23:02.666 --> 23:03.750
Airk?

23:03.750 --> 23:05.166
Airk! We hear you.

23:05.750 --> 23:06.791
Dove?

23:07.458 --> 23:08.750
Is that you?

23:08.750 --> 23:09.833
Where are you?

23:09.833 --> 23:12.333
I'm in a cell, I think.

23:12.333 --> 23:15.333
It's dark and hot.

23:16.375 --> 23:19.333
- I'm alone. I'm scared.
- We're coming for you.

23:19.333 --> 23:21.541
- It's not Airk. It's the Lich.
- Please, help.

23:21.541 --> 23:23.583
- He's trying to break our concentration.
- No.

23:23.583 --> 23:24.916
Don't let him.

23:24.916 --> 23:26.958
- Please!
- I can't be here.

23:26.958 --> 23:28.916
Listen to me. We have to carry on.

23:30.083 --> 23:36.166
<i>Yug shoggog yug sugloth,
yug shoggog el katuth.</i>

23:36.166 --> 23:39.000
<i>Meetach harren, meetach huul...</i>

23:39.000 --> 23:41.375
You shouldn't be doing this, Dada.

23:41.375 --> 23:44.458
You know how it ends, you can't change it.

23:44.458 --> 23:46.125
You can't protect her.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.125
- Shut up!
- Tell her the truth.

23:48.125 --> 23:50.958
- Tell her everything or I will.
- Shut up, I say! Shut up!

23:53.250 --> 23:55.041
<i>Meetach harren, meetach huul.</i>

23:55.041 --> 23:56.875
- What does that mean?
- Focus!

23:56.875 --> 23:59.625
Is there something
that you're not telling me?

23:59.625 --> 24:01.875
- It doesn't matter!
- What happened to your village?

24:01.875 --> 24:04.500
Listen, if you can't be of any use, leave!

24:05.458 --> 24:06.541
Now, go!

24:15.541 --> 24:16.541
Try to relax.

24:28.291 --> 24:30.291
Fiddlesticks!

24:30.291 --> 24:31.916
I hate you, door!

24:33.875 --> 24:37.083
I'm sorry. I'm fine. We're fine.

24:39.458 --> 24:43.000
<i>Boorman...</i>

24:45.083 --> 24:48.208
<i>You can make this right.</i>

24:49.916 --> 24:52.833
<i>She took the Lux.</i>

24:53.875 --> 24:54.958
<i>Boorman...</i>

25:03.666 --> 25:04.791
Those hellions.

25:14.500 --> 25:15.583
Oh.

25:17.708 --> 25:19.083
Why are you out here?

25:20.208 --> 25:21.208
I needed some air.

25:22.041 --> 25:23.833
It was my choice. Is that okay with you?

25:23.833 --> 25:26.291
Yeah. It's fine.

25:40.375 --> 25:41.666
I met these two...

25:44.875 --> 25:48.833
woodcutters when I escaped
from Ballantine.

25:52.875 --> 25:57.500
They were eating lunch
outside of their cottage.

26:00.291 --> 26:03.458
If only I'd kept going,
they'd still be alive.

26:08.041 --> 26:09.166
You were right.

26:10.250 --> 26:12.041
It was stupid to think I...

26:16.125 --> 26:17.833
I can't save anybody.

26:22.250 --> 26:23.541
Listen, uh, when...

26:26.375 --> 26:28.333
When they took you from the campsite...

26:29.916 --> 26:31.625
...we all spread out
to go look for you.

26:32.666 --> 26:34.166
Do you hear that?

26:36.208 --> 26:39.416
What, Graydon being reamed?

26:40.000 --> 26:42.750
Look, I'm tryin' to tell you
something right now, can you...

26:44.416 --> 26:45.500
No.

26:46.708 --> 26:47.833
That voice.

26:49.583 --> 26:50.833
I know it.

26:50.833 --> 26:52.125
I've heard it before.

26:52.125 --> 26:54.000
Wait. Wait, I'll come with you.

26:55.125 --> 26:56.875
I cannot lose you a third time.

26:59.583 --> 27:01.916
Oh, Willow's gonna be pissed.

27:21.125 --> 27:22.583
<i>Jade, run!</i>

27:23.458 --> 27:24.458
<i>Run!</i>

27:29.916 --> 27:31.000
Mother?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.375
Now, you die!

27:59.458 --> 28:00.458
Die!

28:01.208 --> 28:02.916
No mercy!

28:12.875 --> 28:14.333
Die!

28:29.708 --> 28:31.625
<i>Stand aside for Queen Bavmorda.</i>

28:33.625 --> 28:35.208
ELORA'S MOTHER:
<i>You cannot stop the prophecy!</i>

28:35.208 --> 28:37.291
<i>This child
will have no power over me.</i>

28:37.291 --> 28:40.166
<i>- Start the ritual.</i>
- ELORA'S MOTHER: <i>No!</i>

28:40.166 --> 28:42.500
<i>Your reign of terror is at an end!</i>

28:42.500 --> 28:44.625
<i>She will come back
and she will finish you!</i>

28:44.625 --> 28:47.166
- <i>Silence, wench.</i>
- ELORA'S MOTHER: <i>My baby will finish you!</i>

28:49.750 --> 28:50.958
Kill her.

28:59.916 --> 29:00.916
No!

29:02.708 --> 29:03.833
Mother?

29:07.291 --> 29:08.375
She's here.

29:08.375 --> 29:09.750
I feel her.

29:09.750 --> 29:11.000
I see her!

29:11.000 --> 29:14.708
Oh, she's grown up, fierce and resilient.

29:14.708 --> 29:19.583
She is the beacon of light
in a time of dread.

29:20.500 --> 29:21.750
No!

29:57.291 --> 30:00.083
Sweet mercy! I thought you were...

30:00.083 --> 30:01.625
How did you get in here?

30:02.166 --> 30:03.166
Through the door?

30:03.875 --> 30:04.875
What?

30:04.875 --> 30:06.958
I just spent the last half an hour
barricading the door!

30:06.958 --> 30:09.375
There's definitely something very wrong
with this castle.

30:09.375 --> 30:10.458
Right?

30:10.458 --> 30:12.791
God, the spiral staircase
just tried to eat me.

30:12.791 --> 30:15.208
I feel like we'd be better off
in the storm.

30:16.208 --> 30:18.125
All due respect, Your Majesty,

30:18.125 --> 30:19.291
but no shit.

30:22.041 --> 30:23.125
What?

30:28.458 --> 30:31.125
- (IN DEEPER VOICE) Who is it?
- We have swords!

30:31.125 --> 30:34.083
And crossbows
and spiked flails with poison.

30:34.083 --> 30:36.583
Oh, wow.
Okay, I surrender. Now let me in.

30:39.541 --> 30:40.583
How do we know it's you?

30:40.583 --> 30:44.083
Oh, I don't know, my fiery aroma,
my sweet singing voice. Take your pick.

30:44.083 --> 30:46.625
Tell us something
only the real Boorman would know.

30:46.625 --> 30:50.083
Okay, you two have totally got
the hots for each other.

30:53.916 --> 30:55.250
- We don't.
- Yeah, at all.

30:58.125 --> 31:00.625
- Where is it?
- Oh! Hey!

31:00.625 --> 31:02.708
You were the only one
in the catacombs with me,

31:02.708 --> 31:05.208
- only you could've guessed I had it.
- Had what?

31:05.875 --> 31:07.083
The Lux Arcana.

31:07.833 --> 31:11.208
You have no idea what it means to me
and what I would do to get it back.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.958
Please remove your grubby hands
from my Princess.

31:20.208 --> 31:21.916
Uh, let's start over.

31:29.791 --> 31:31.500
What happened? Where's Willow?

31:32.625 --> 31:35.583
Gone. And we're in big trouble.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.875
The ritual, it worked, sorta.

31:38.875 --> 31:40.916
He was able
to draw the poison out of me but,

31:40.916 --> 31:43.541
it got into him
and now he's the Lich and I'm, well...

31:44.416 --> 31:45.416
You get my point.

31:45.416 --> 31:48.375
Sorry, do you mind helping me with this?
I just... Thank you.

31:52.250 --> 31:53.541
You're okay.

31:53.541 --> 31:54.708
Yeah.

31:56.041 --> 31:58.541
But Willow's not.
So come on, we have to find him.

32:00.791 --> 32:02.791
Thank you, by the way, for saving my life.

32:03.916 --> 32:05.583
- Willow!
- Willow!

32:05.583 --> 32:06.708
Willow!

32:07.958 --> 32:10.833
Where could he be?

32:10.833 --> 32:12.000
Just wait, let me...

32:13.250 --> 32:14.500
We can figure this out.

32:15.333 --> 32:16.750
We have to think like he would.

32:16.750 --> 32:19.041
Not Willow, the Lich. Where would he go?

32:19.958 --> 32:21.000
The High Tower!

32:21.000 --> 32:24.333
The Ritual of the Thirteenth Night,
a doorway between two worlds. Yes!

32:24.333 --> 32:26.375
- I'll go. It's not safe for you.
- No.

32:26.375 --> 32:28.916
Willow saved my life,
it's my turn to save his.

32:28.916 --> 32:30.208
How do you know where to go?

32:31.250 --> 32:32.458
I was born here.

32:50.583 --> 32:54.541
Okay, it's very possible

32:54.541 --> 32:58.083
that I might have
overreacted a little bit.

32:58.083 --> 33:00.166
So I formally apologize.

33:00.166 --> 33:02.833
But, if you'll give me back my Lux,
I'll be on my way.

33:02.833 --> 33:04.250
You said you didn't find it.

33:05.208 --> 33:07.958
Yes, well, I may have lied about that.

33:07.958 --> 33:10.333
Which is irrelevant, because you liars

33:10.333 --> 33:13.791
are the only two people I've been
intimately close to since I had it.

33:14.541 --> 33:17.208
- When were you intimately close with him?
- When were you?

33:17.208 --> 33:19.500
Uh...

33:19.500 --> 33:22.958
It's Nockmaar tryin' to get in our heads
and pin us against each other.

33:22.958 --> 33:24.041
What's a Lux?

33:25.625 --> 33:28.541
Why does it mean so much to you,
that you're ready to turn on us?

33:30.708 --> 33:32.416
Look. The tower.

33:32.416 --> 33:33.500
Seriously?

33:34.000 --> 33:35.458
You have such a low opinion of us.

33:35.458 --> 33:38.250
You really think
we're gonna fall for that old chestnut?

33:39.166 --> 33:40.500
No, no, no, he's right.

33:41.208 --> 33:42.458
There's someone up there.

33:54.875 --> 33:57.416
- Another trick?
- Maybe.

34:00.125 --> 34:01.125
Elora?

34:14.708 --> 34:15.708
He's not here.

34:17.375 --> 34:18.416
No.

34:19.833 --> 34:22.208
I don't understand, where could he be?

34:23.708 --> 34:29.291
I don't know, but maybe it's okay.

34:29.291 --> 34:31.125
What do you mean okay?

34:31.125 --> 34:33.833
We have to find him before it's too late.

34:33.833 --> 34:35.000
Don't you see?

34:35.000 --> 34:36.250
It doesn't matter.

34:39.458 --> 34:41.291
He can't help you anymore.

34:43.166 --> 34:44.875
Oh, shit!

34:48.583 --> 34:49.875
We're gonna finish the ritual.

34:51.166 --> 34:52.208
Tonight.

35:02.416 --> 35:04.291
I know you're in there, Gray.

35:04.291 --> 35:06.875
And I know some part of you can hear me.

35:06.875 --> 35:08.291
I've never felt stronger.

35:10.333 --> 35:11.333
You've looked better.

35:16.083 --> 35:17.708
This is what you want, right?

35:17.708 --> 35:20.750
Confidence, strength? I can have that.

35:20.750 --> 35:22.875
Clearly, but that's not what I want.

35:22.875 --> 35:24.083
It's what Airk has.

35:25.041 --> 35:26.500
But it's not why I love him.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.125
What did I say was the number one
most important safety rule?

35:37.041 --> 35:39.208
"No matter what,
stay out of the High Tower."

35:39.208 --> 35:41.791
You are the worst apprentice ever!

35:42.250 --> 35:43.250
Willow!

35:56.250 --> 35:58.291
So tiny and helpless.

35:59.250 --> 36:04.916
Yet you survived, when Bavmorda,
the most powerful of sorceresses, fell.

36:05.041 --> 36:07.583
Don't you wanna know why?

36:08.583 --> 36:11.958
Black fires forever kindled within.

36:11.958 --> 36:14.791
- Let the second rite begin.
- <i>Let the second rite begin.</i>

36:15.375 --> 36:16.750
I know why.

36:17.416 --> 36:20.125
Willow defeated her using the...

36:21.625 --> 36:26.291
The Fiberatchi Obliteration or something.

36:26.958 --> 36:29.000
And now he's gonna use it
to kick your ass.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.583
Is he though?

36:31.708 --> 36:33.750
Do you wanna tell her or should I?

36:34.416 --> 36:36.208
Don't listen to it, Elora.

36:40.041 --> 36:42.250
You stupid hag!

36:42.958 --> 36:47.125
With my magic,
I'll send her into the... Into a...

36:47.250 --> 36:49.375
You're no sorcerer.

36:49.375 --> 36:51.958
Into a realm where evil cannot touch her!

36:51.958 --> 36:54.666
Impossible! There's no such place!

36:54.666 --> 36:57.541
<i>Helgafel swath ben helgafel.</i>

36:57.541 --> 36:58.791
<i>Helgafel!</i>

37:02.166 --> 37:03.166
You!

37:13.125 --> 37:14.916
Willow didn't defeat Bavmorda.

37:14.916 --> 37:18.000
She was thwarted by her own carelessness.

37:37.291 --> 37:38.458
So tell me.

37:39.375 --> 37:40.875
How will you defeat us?

37:40.875 --> 37:42.125
Same as last time.

37:44.666 --> 37:45.750
With my friends.

37:51.250 --> 37:52.291
Willow, catch!

37:54.916 --> 37:56.291
<i>Furrock!</i>

38:08.666 --> 38:12.541
Get the hell out of Graydon!

38:17.000 --> 38:19.875
Get off!

38:32.541 --> 38:35.541
We have to.

38:36.500 --> 38:37.833
It's time.

38:38.375 --> 38:40.166
Just wait!

38:40.833 --> 38:41.833
Wait!

38:49.750 --> 38:51.000
She needs her mother.

38:52.916 --> 38:54.375
You can't help her.

38:56.458 --> 38:58.125
But you can help Graydon.

38:59.666 --> 39:00.875
You can still save him.

39:03.416 --> 39:07.333
I can't. I tried. I... I don't have the...

39:07.333 --> 39:10.458
You grew the eckleberry bush!

39:10.458 --> 39:11.833
The seed charm.

39:12.708 --> 39:13.708
It worked.

39:14.583 --> 39:15.791
I saw it in the woods.

39:15.791 --> 39:16.875
It was...

39:17.333 --> 39:20.083
It was beautiful.

39:21.083 --> 39:23.208
So I'm gonna need you
to get your shit together

39:23.208 --> 39:25.708
and use whatever it is
you've got to save Graydon.

39:25.708 --> 39:27.750
'Cause if you don't,
you're gonna regret it,

39:28.333 --> 39:29.875
for the rest of your life.

39:30.958 --> 39:32.958
- I don't know how.
- Yes, you do.

39:32.958 --> 39:35.416
Just throw out the recipe.

39:38.916 --> 39:42.208
Damn it, Elora! Don't you dare!

39:43.625 --> 39:44.791
Get off!

40:11.916 --> 40:13.291
<i>I'm not like you.</i>

40:13.291 --> 40:15.750
<i>I couldn't even load the crossbow
that he gave me.</i>

40:15.750 --> 40:17.583
You're smarter than I'll ever be.

40:17.583 --> 40:20.041
Riding and fighting
doesn't make a good ruler.

40:20.041 --> 40:21.250
Wisdom does.

40:21.916 --> 40:23.458
Come on, Graydon.

40:23.458 --> 40:26.666
You can do this,
and I'll catch you if you fall.

40:48.791 --> 40:50.625
Never doubted you for a second.

40:55.166 --> 40:57.041
Ah.

41:01.666 --> 41:02.666
Ow.

41:02.958 --> 41:05.291
Why does my face feel on fire?

41:06.041 --> 41:08.375
That's completely normal.
Don't worry about it.

41:33.291 --> 41:35.333
Hey, you know what,
I'm gonna miss this place.

41:35.333 --> 41:39.125
Say what you want about the service,
but I think it's got personality.

41:39.125 --> 41:41.083
What is the Blood of the Six?

41:42.625 --> 41:44.666
In the beginning, in the Grove,

41:45.333 --> 41:49.166
six fays betrayed the Mothers
to serve the dark power.

41:49.166 --> 41:54.166
That line continued through the ages,
strong magic but corrupt.

41:54.166 --> 41:55.833
The Blood of the Six.

41:56.666 --> 41:58.666
So Bavmorda, she was the Blood of the Six.

41:58.666 --> 41:59.833
Which means so am I.

42:02.833 --> 42:03.833
And so is Airk.

42:03.958 --> 42:07.500
Mmm. We have to reach the Immemorial City
before she corrupts him.

42:07.500 --> 42:09.833
Yeah,
that's on the far side of the world.

42:10.750 --> 42:12.125
Is that even possible?

42:13.166 --> 42:14.500
She saved Graydon.

42:14.500 --> 42:15.750
Anything's possible.

42:18.166 --> 42:19.541
We're finally making progress.

42:19.541 --> 42:21.166
You may make a sorceress yet.

42:32.541 --> 42:34.333
<i>Take the girl.</i>

42:34.333 --> 42:35.833
<i>Kill the others.</i>

43:07.458 --> 43:08.750
Is somebody there?

43:36.083 --> 43:37.083
Hello?

43:38.416 --> 43:39.750
Anybody?

43:40.791 --> 43:42.125
Is anybody out there?
