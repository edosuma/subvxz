WEBVTT

00:05.506 --> 00:06.474
Ooh!

00:06.507 --> 00:08.309
Hot apple tarts.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.444
Well, almost hot.
The microwave's acting up again.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.113
Yeah, just chip through
the icy crust

00:12.146 --> 00:13.414
until you get to the hot apple
center.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.382
But be careful
because we lost two forks

00:14.415 --> 00:17.051
this morning on frozen
breakfast burritos.

00:24.592 --> 00:27.195
Why don't you just let me
buy you a new microwave?

00:27.228 --> 00:30.398
Because I can't keep relying on
you every time something breaks.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.565
You already bought us
a new dishwasher,

00:31.599 --> 00:33.434
a coffee maker,
then there was the vacuum.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.169
Well, that one
actually didn't break.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.237
Goodwill came to the door,

00:36.270 --> 00:39.273
and I, uh, panicked.

00:39.307 --> 00:41.342
When I gave your mother that
microwave for our anniversary,

00:41.375 --> 00:43.244
she was speechless.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.246
Best $79 I ever spent.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.750
I should've married Burt
Reynolds when I had the chance.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.585
You never had the chance.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.721
From the age of 18 to 42,

00:53.754 --> 00:56.257
I could've had any man.

00:56.290 --> 00:59.227
Any man.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.494
I haven't had
to do this much work

01:00.528 --> 01:02.596
for this little reward
since Homecoming.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.538
You know what?
I'm gonna buy you a microwave

01:10.571 --> 01:11.672
That's it, I'm done.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.574
Also I'm done with this.

01:13.607 --> 01:14.542
I'll take it!

01:14.575 --> 01:15.609
Oh-ho, Mikayla, no.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.645
I said no sweets for a week.

01:17.678 --> 01:20.248
Mikayla was caught
twerking on the playground.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.351
Yeah, so she's being punished.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.653
That's how you discipline?
No sweets for a week?

01:25.686 --> 01:27.821
Your parents are the ones
who should be punished

01:27.855 --> 01:30.658
for robbing you
of a learning experience.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.494
Debbie, why didn't you give her
one of my apology reports?

01:33.527 --> 01:34.662
Because I'm punishing my child.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.830
I'm not torturing her.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.499
What's an apology report?

01:38.532 --> 01:40.601
Well, as a former teacher, I had
my kids give a presentation

01:40.634 --> 01:42.603
that stated what they did wrong

01:42.636 --> 01:46.507
and showed equal parts
imagination and sincere regret.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.877
Debbie always had trouble
with the sincere part.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.146
"Sorry that I used
all your fancy soaps

01:52.180 --> 01:54.182
"to give my dolls a bubble bath.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.550
I'm also sorry that you're
too cheap to buy me new dolls."

01:56.584 --> 01:58.152
Try again.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.187
Lose the attitude.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.521
Again?!

02:00.554 --> 02:01.755
That's, like, ten times!

02:01.789 --> 02:03.791
(deep breath)

02:07.295 --> 02:10.298
"I'm sorry that I used
all your fancy soaps..."

02:10.331 --> 02:11.832
If you just put a little
more effort into them

02:11.865 --> 02:13.534
like Nathan did,

02:13.567 --> 02:14.735
they would've been
a lot easier.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.170
A little effort?

02:16.204 --> 02:17.638
He spent the whole day
in the basement

02:17.671 --> 02:18.539
making an elaborate video.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.441
It was like he was trying
to win the Oscar

02:20.474 --> 02:21.709
for Best Suck-Up.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.644
That is not true.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.579
We didn't get awards.

02:25.613 --> 02:28.582
Although if we did,
I definitely would've won one.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.918
YOUNG NATHAN:
Yo, yo, yo, America!

02:30.951 --> 02:32.620
And my-Mom-i-ca.

02:32.653 --> 02:36.457
You're watching Nate TV.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.925
I didn't mean to scratch,
scratch, scratch, scratch,

02:37.958 --> 02:39.560
scratch, scratch your car.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.595
From, from, from, from,
from, from now on,

02:41.629 --> 02:43.931
I'll practice my golf swing
in the back, back, back, back,

02:43.964 --> 02:45.499
back, back, backyard.

02:45.533 --> 02:48.502
None of the records you
care about were hurt in
the making of this video.

02:48.536 --> 02:49.703
(whoops)

02:49.737 --> 02:51.239
Peace out, 'rents.

02:51.272 --> 02:54.242
I'm-a go make my bed.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.310
No matter how much trouble
Nathan was in,

02:56.344 --> 02:57.845
I could never stay mad at him

02:57.878 --> 03:00.914
after one of his masterful
apology reports.

03:00.948 --> 03:03.484
He was like
a little Bill Clinton.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.421
You know, uh,
my dad used to be a cop,

03:07.455 --> 03:08.822
so anytime I would have a fight
with my sister,

03:08.856 --> 03:10.958
he would just handcuff us
together until we made up,

03:10.991 --> 03:13.627
which worked. Except now
my sister's into some...

03:13.661 --> 03:15.863
pretty weird stuff.
Well, we have

03:15.896 --> 03:17.865
our own parenting style,
and I'm not making Mikayla

03:17.898 --> 03:19.400
do an apology report.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.768
They were humiliating.

03:20.801 --> 03:21.769
That's what made
them so funny.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.004
I used to tape 'em
and show the guys at work.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.540
Bet I still have the tapes
in the basement.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.709
Unless I recorded Matlock
over 'em.

03:28.742 --> 03:32.413
Either way,
we got a fun night ahead of us.

03:59.940 --> 04:03.444
And you scored a 14,
which makes you a...

04:03.477 --> 04:04.578
"Hot Tamale"!

04:04.612 --> 04:09.383
Oh! I don't need a magazine
to tell me that.
(laughs)

04:10.418 --> 04:11.919
Hey, Ray, what are
you doing here?

04:11.952 --> 04:13.921
It's not Downton Abbey night.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.590
Ray's gonna crash here
for a couple of nights.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.392
Yeah, I had a big girl
over at the house.

04:18.426 --> 04:19.393
It's gonna take
a couple of days

04:19.427 --> 04:21.895
before my memory foam mattress
forgets about her.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.533
Nathan, the appliance
store called.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.601
They delivered Debbie's
new microwave today

04:27.635 --> 04:29.069
and charged your card.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.740
Oh, that's so nice you bought
your sister a new microwave.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.776
(chuckles)
Your boy is
the whole package:

04:35.809 --> 04:37.077
handsome, generous

04:37.110 --> 04:41.415
and real gentle
with a back-scratcher.

04:41.449 --> 04:43.717
He's the sweetest child
a mother could ask for.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.953
(whispers loudly):
That's the reason
he's my favorite.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.722
That's very nice of you, Mom,
but you shouldn't say that.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.491
Parents don't have favorites.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.659
Oh, I'm sure some do.

04:51.692 --> 04:54.628
I heard Jeffrey Dahmer's brother
was a smooth jazz pianist.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.063
(chuckles)

04:56.096 --> 04:58.799
But even if he isn't,
I bet he never ate a foot.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.601
(laughs)
You hear what I said?

05:00.634 --> 05:02.370
I heard what you said!
All right,

05:02.403 --> 05:04.037
look, Debbie is not
a serial killer.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.539
My mom's just being silly.

05:05.573 --> 05:06.874
She doesn't really
have a favorite.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.909
Sure, I do.

05:11.579 --> 05:13.347
You.
(chuckles)

05:13.381 --> 05:14.982
All right,
I think you've had enough.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.717
CAROL:
Oh, come on!

05:16.750 --> 05:19.052
I'm just being honest.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.755
I didn't say
I didn't love your sister.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.857
I love you both the same.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.463
But when it comes to like,

05:29.497 --> 05:31.899
I think I like you
a teeny bit more.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.768
Okay, Mom, stop it. Come on.
Ooh, a teeny-weeny bit more.

05:34.802 --> 05:37.638
All right, all right, all right.
Look, yes, truth be told,

05:37.671 --> 05:39.973
I get why I'd be the favorite.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.009
Yeah, and, you know...
and I'm flattered.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.844
But you just... you can't say
stuff like that out loud.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.513
If Debbie heard,
she'd be upset

05:45.546 --> 05:47.014
and she would
definitely overreact.
Oh, please.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.550
She'll be fine.
She's got your dad.

05:49.583 --> 05:50.751
What do you mean she's got Dad?

05:50.784 --> 05:52.720
She's your father's favorite.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.922
(chuckles)
Yeah, r... right.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.757
(chuckles)

05:56.790 --> 05:59.993
Wait, you're telling me
that Debbie is Dad's favorite?

06:00.027 --> 06:01.729
And you're my favorite.

06:01.762 --> 06:02.696
Yeah, clear on that.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.832
Let's get back
to the Dad and Debbie thing.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.900
Relax. I didn't say
he didn't love you.

06:06.934 --> 06:10.438
He just likes her
a teeny-weeny bit more.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.705
I can see that.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.707
Oh, really, Ray?
You can see that?

06:13.741 --> 06:15.576
Well, what possibly prompts you
to think

06:15.609 --> 06:18.779
that my dad could-could possibly
pick Debbie over me?

06:18.812 --> 06:21.048
Well, for one thing,
Debbie doesn't pop her Ps

06:21.081 --> 06:22.816
and get spittle
in my Zinfandel.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.952
(chuckles)
I can't believe him.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.187
I'm his firstborn son!

06:27.220 --> 06:29.189
I mean, Debbie? Come on!

06:29.222 --> 06:32.626
Has he even met her?
It's no contest!

06:32.660 --> 06:34.628
Nathan, you're
just being silly.

06:34.662 --> 06:36.864
Mmm.
Don't give it
another thought!

06:36.897 --> 06:37.865
And don't be so greedy!

06:37.898 --> 06:39.967
You're your mom's favorite.
You're my favorite.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.803
How many people's favorites
do you need to be?!

06:42.836 --> 06:44.972
Everybody's!

06:45.005 --> 06:48.742
Did you watch last
week's Downton Abbey?

06:48.776 --> 06:51.879
Has Lord Grantham
lost his mind?!

06:51.912 --> 06:53.914
Right!

07:00.020 --> 07:01.855
Hey, guys.
Hey, Nate.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.223
Thanks again
for this microwave.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.559
It's awesome.
It's quiet, it cooks.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.795
It's like the perfect wife. Huh?

07:07.828 --> 07:08.962
Am I right, buddy?
Am I...

07:08.996 --> 07:11.064
Uh... Never mind.
I'm not that guy.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.737
So, uh...

07:16.770 --> 07:19.607
I guess the-the microwave is
Adam's new favorite appliance.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.609
Would you agree with that?
Would you...

07:21.642 --> 07:23.911
would you say that Debbie's
microwave is your favorite?

07:23.944 --> 07:25.913
Oh, yeah, sure.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.982
Oh. So, uh... so you like
Debbie's microwave

07:29.016 --> 07:30.484
more than mine?

07:30.518 --> 07:33.053
Well, it's newer.

07:33.086 --> 07:36.590
Oh. So newer's always better
for you, huh?

07:36.624 --> 07:40.494
Even though you've known
my microwave longer?

07:40.528 --> 07:43.731
Nathan, did you double up
on your diet pills again?

07:43.764 --> 07:45.666
No, Dad.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.768
Mom told me that Debbie
is your favorite.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.837
Wait. Really?
Why-why would she say that?

07:49.870 --> 07:53.641
Let me guess. She was
drinking wine from a box.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.108
Yep.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.944
Always does it.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.880
With the bottle, she knows
to stop at the label.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.215
With the box, she can't see
how much she drank.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.917
She'll just... keep going

08:03.951 --> 08:06.954
until she starts making prank
calls to Chinese restaurants.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.957
So i-is it true?

08:09.990 --> 08:12.125
Is Debbie your favorite?

08:12.159 --> 08:13.961
DEBBIE:
Dad, don't be rude.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.095
Nathan's asking you
a question.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.897
Is Debbie
your favorite?

08:16.930 --> 08:19.232
Please say that Debbie
is your favorite.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.935
I love you both the same.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.170
No, no, no, no, no.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.572
That's not what I asked.

08:24.605 --> 08:25.539
What's going on?
DEBBIE:
Mom told Nathan

08:25.573 --> 08:26.907
I was Dad's favorite.

08:26.940 --> 08:27.875
Nice!
I know, right?

08:27.908 --> 08:30.277
(grunting)

08:30.310 --> 08:32.145
Okay, just put your high five
back in your pocket.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.947
He hasn't answered quite yet.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.949
Sophie's Choice, Dad,
let's do it.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.618
Debbie and I are in a building,

08:37.651 --> 08:39.753
it's burning to the ground.
Who do you pull out?

08:39.787 --> 08:41.855
I don't know.
What floor are you on?

08:41.889 --> 08:44.257
Dad, it doesn't really...
Second floor.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.593
Whose building is it?

08:45.626 --> 08:47.227
It's mine! It's an investment.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.028
Stop stalling.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.997
Why yours?
It could be my building.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.064
What-what building
are you gonna buy?

08:51.098 --> 08:54.267
God, your credit score looks
like a speed limit.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.203
I had to co-sign
for you to get cable

08:56.236 --> 08:58.271
and they still turned you down
for Showtime.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.608
Maybe someone in Adam's family
died and left it to us.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.743
Yeah, probably my Uncle Nick.
He smokes in bed.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.311
Who cares? There's still
a chance to save one of us.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.312
Who is it? Who?

09:05.345 --> 09:07.114
Who?
Just say it.

09:07.147 --> 09:07.948
I'd save Debbie.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.317
Ah! Aw...
Oh, my gosh,

09:10.350 --> 09:11.985
oh, my gosh,
oh, my gosh. Finally.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.121
Finally, I'm number one
at something in this family.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.689
Oh. Oh, I wish I had a tiara.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.024
Ooh. Ooh, ooh.
You know what?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.258
I have one in the garage.
(chuckles)

09:18.291 --> 09:20.060
Who's a hoarder now?

09:22.930 --> 09:23.764
You're really loving this, huh?

09:23.797 --> 09:24.732
Well, guess what.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.266
I'm Mom's favorite.

09:29.637 --> 09:30.971
Why aren't you freaking out?

09:31.004 --> 09:32.640
The same reason I don't
freak out every morning

09:32.673 --> 09:34.908
when the sun comes up.
It's not a surprise.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.109
Dad, how could
you pick Debbie over me?

09:36.143 --> 09:39.312
She can't even appreciate the
majesty of a new day dawning.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.081
I don't know, Nathan.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.150
Maybe it's because you were
always hanging on to your mother

09:43.183 --> 09:44.985
so I spent more time
with Debbie.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.854
Plus, you and I did have
that rough patch

09:46.887 --> 09:48.055
after the loose change incident.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.657
I was eight.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.759
I took some change out
of your sock drawer.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.293
And then you lied about it.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.995
Sure, Debbie got
in trouble sometimes,

09:55.028 --> 09:56.196
but she never lied to me.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.065
Yeah, because if you
don't have your word,

09:58.098 --> 10:00.968
what do you have,
Nate? Right, Pops?

10:02.435 --> 10:04.071
She never lied, huh?
Well, how 'bout in high school

10:04.104 --> 10:05.806
when she said that she broke
your bed practicing

10:05.839 --> 10:07.274
a gymnastics routine?

10:07.307 --> 10:09.276
Well, the guy she broke your bed
with was named Jim,

10:09.309 --> 10:12.012
so there were
some Jim-nastics involved.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.313
Nathan!

10:13.346 --> 10:16.116
Debbie,

10:16.149 --> 10:19.219
is Nathan's pun true?

10:19.252 --> 10:20.988
Uh, Dad, I can explain.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.990
Oh...
I-I was young, you know?

10:23.023 --> 10:25.693
And I'd just been introduced
to peach schnapps and tube tops!

10:25.726 --> 10:27.427
Debbie, we had a deal.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.096
You would always be honest
with me

10:29.129 --> 10:31.164
and I would never embarrass you
in front of your friends

10:31.198 --> 10:33.033
with my underwater voice.

10:33.066 --> 10:37.971
(gurgling):
Well, all bets are off.

10:41.274 --> 10:44.044
What the hell is wrong with you?

10:44.077 --> 10:45.145
Look, I'm sorry,
okay? It just...

10:45.178 --> 10:48.181
I was upset, and I shouldn't
have said it. I... but...

10:48.215 --> 10:49.449
Come on, you're a grown-up.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.118
What's he gonna do, ground you?

10:51.151 --> 10:53.220
No, but I still have to live
under the same roof as him.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.022
You know, I have
to see him every day.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.124
How would you
like it if...?

11:00.994 --> 11:03.030
What are you smiling at?

11:03.063 --> 11:05.398
Come on, Debbie.
Don't do this.

11:05.432 --> 11:06.767
Where's my mother?

11:06.800 --> 11:07.935
She's upstairs in her room.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.102
She's been there
since your dad called

11:09.136 --> 11:10.871
and told her you
broke their bed.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.139
I haven't seen anybody that mad

11:12.172 --> 11:15.042
since I heckled Kramer
in that comedy club.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.178
I can't believe
you would desecrate yourself

11:18.211 --> 11:19.980
and your great-grandmother's
bed while we were...

11:20.013 --> 11:21.448
Save it.
In about 20 seconds,

11:21.481 --> 11:23.383
you're gonna forget
all about your stupid bed.

11:23.416 --> 11:24.918
I love you, Mommy.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.895
She could be telling
her anything.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.830
I keep so many secrets
from my mom.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.331
I can't believe
that my last meal

11:38.365 --> 11:40.267
is gonna be egg whites
and turkey bacon.

11:44.004 --> 11:44.772
Have fun with Mommy.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.110
Don't worry.
I'm here for you, buddy.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.980
She's not gonna yell at you
if you got a friend over.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.484
Good luck.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.755
I know what you did.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.824
Yeah, I know what I did, too.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.159
I... I did it,
and-and I'm sorry.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.761
Sorry about what?

12:07.795 --> 12:09.096
The thing I did.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.064
Come on, we've already
gone through this.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.967
Could I...? Just,
look, let's move on.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.069
I want to hear you say it.

12:16.103 --> 12:18.105
Fine.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.307
I smoked pot once. Twice.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.909
A handful of times.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.376
I just wanted to
understand the drug

12:23.410 --> 12:26.079
before I crusaded against it.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.280
Not it.

12:27.314 --> 12:30.083
Okay, the exchange student
that we hosted for a semester

12:30.117 --> 12:32.285
was just my friend Billy
doing a funny voice.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.022
Not it.

12:35.055 --> 12:38.091
Okay, okay. When I was 20, I got
a tattoo, but it was just...

12:38.125 --> 12:39.326
I didn't tell you
because I-I...

12:39.359 --> 12:40.994
I know your wedding was fake!

12:41.028 --> 12:43.496
Debbie told me that you and
Janice got married in Vegas

12:43.530 --> 12:46.066
three months before you had
your wedding in my church.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.168
Want to go back to my tattoo?

12:48.201 --> 12:49.236
It's really stupid.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.404
It's just my... it's my
Donkey Kong high score,

12:51.438 --> 12:53.206
and I beat it, like,
two days later.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.042
How could you?

12:55.075 --> 12:57.210
You lied to me.

12:57.244 --> 13:00.213
The plan was to elope and ditch
the big wedding altogether,

13:00.247 --> 13:03.851
and I couldn't do that to you,
so, maybe you want to thank me?

13:03.884 --> 13:05.986
Oh, yeah, Nathan, thank you.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.155
Thank you for robbing me
of the opportunity

13:08.188 --> 13:10.123
to see my only son
actually get married.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.492
Thank you for lying
to me about it.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.195
And thank you
for making me feel like a fool.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.130
You've broken my heart, Nathan.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.132
But don't worry about it.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.169
Just pretend
it never happened.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.536
You're good at that.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.510
I'm still your favorite,
though, right?

13:38.185 --> 13:39.853
I do.

13:39.887 --> 13:40.988
As my wife,

13:41.021 --> 13:43.891
you are the second most
important woman in my life.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.630
How'd that look
before her head fell off?

13:50.663 --> 13:52.399
RAY:
Pretty good.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.401
Check it out.

13:54.434 --> 13:55.936
(sighs)

13:55.969 --> 13:57.871
This is gonna be my best
apology report yet.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.172
It totally looks
like we're in a chapel.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.041
Yeah, then
we're going to head over

14:01.074 --> 14:02.943
to the poolside reception where,
using some footage

14:02.976 --> 14:04.244
from one
of your old home movies,

14:04.277 --> 14:06.213
I gave your mom her dream date.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.081
A Mr. Burt Reynolds.

14:08.115 --> 14:10.050
(laughter)

14:10.083 --> 14:11.952
There's no way she can stay mad
at me after this.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.254
Hey.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.222
What are you doing
in my basement?

14:15.255 --> 14:16.924
Making my apology report
for Mom,

14:16.957 --> 14:18.358
thanks to you
and your big mouth.

14:18.391 --> 14:19.559
All right, now, let's, uh...

14:19.592 --> 14:21.428
let's get started
on my Dad's video.

14:21.461 --> 14:24.097
Oh.
Wait a second.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.232
Why are you making a video
for Dad?

14:25.265 --> 14:26.433
He's mad at me, not you.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.035
Well, he still seems upset

14:28.068 --> 14:29.436
about the whole
loose change incident.

14:29.469 --> 14:32.005
Oh, my God.
You are such a weasel.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.273
You're gonna use
this whole situation

14:33.306 --> 14:35.308
and try
to become Dad's favorite.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.910
That's not what
I'm doing at all.

14:36.944 --> 14:38.145
Oh, please.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.479
Why do you always have
to outshine me?

14:39.512 --> 14:41.148
The whole reason
we're in this mess

14:41.181 --> 14:42.582
is because you couldn't
stand the fact

14:42.615 --> 14:44.284
you weren't everybody's favorite
in the first place.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.652
All I'm doing
is apologizing.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.087
Feel free to do the same thing.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.688
Oh, really, Mr. Big Shot?
Really?

14:48.721 --> 14:50.290
Because the last time I checked,

14:50.323 --> 14:53.260
I don't have a fancy camera,
or fancy special effects,

14:53.293 --> 14:54.294
or a fancy cameraman.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.495
No offense Ray.

14:55.528 --> 14:56.696
You didn't say
anything insulting.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.065
I am fancy.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.232
"Mr. Big Shot"?

14:59.266 --> 15:00.200
Where is that coming from?

15:00.233 --> 15:01.568
Your coffee mug
does say it.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.670
I'm not drinking out
of it right now, Ray!

15:03.703 --> 15:05.372
I'm surprised
you don't put it on a chain

15:05.405 --> 15:06.539
and wear it around your neck.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.308
Well, that is ridiculous.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.377
Coffee would go everywhere!

15:10.410 --> 15:14.014
Can you believe her...
talking to me like that?

15:15.582 --> 15:17.684
What the hell are you doing?

15:17.717 --> 15:19.486
I'm giving back
your stupid microwave.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.354
You only bought it
for me to look good

15:21.388 --> 15:23.190
in front of Mom and Dad anyway.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.158
That thing was brand new.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.227
You can't just be
throwing around appliances!

15:28.261 --> 15:30.497
And there's your toaster.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.099
Because I don't need
Dad to be reminded

15:32.132 --> 15:33.166
you're more successful than me

15:33.200 --> 15:36.203
every time he feels like
heating up his underwear.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.271
Debbie, you're acting crazy!

15:38.305 --> 15:40.307
(loud scraping
and rattling on floor above)

15:42.409 --> 15:45.312
Did you buy your sister
a dishwasher?

15:45.345 --> 15:46.146
Yeah, a really nice one.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.181
I would get the hell
out of the way.

15:48.215 --> 15:49.516
Get out the way!

15:56.389 --> 15:59.559
Ugh! Can't believe I have to be
here for Nathan's stupid video.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.194
I'm very happy to be here.

16:01.228 --> 16:04.031
Something tells me
after I see this apology report,

16:04.064 --> 16:06.299
I'm going to be back
in the hug business.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.603
This is gonna be
my best one yet.

16:10.637 --> 16:15.442
Mom, Dad, Debbie, I give you
The Millers News.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.211
We're here in Las Vegas,
city of sin,

16:18.245 --> 16:21.348
and home to the biggest sin
in Miller family history--

16:21.381 --> 16:24.351
my secret
Godless drive-thru elopement.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.585
It all started when...

16:25.618 --> 16:27.120
RAY:
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep, beep...

16:27.154 --> 16:28.355
...as a boy, growing up...

16:28.388 --> 16:30.323
Beep, beep, beep, beep,
beep, beepady, beep,

16:30.357 --> 16:32.359
beepady, beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beepady, beep,

16:32.392 --> 16:34.261
beepady, beep, beep, beepady,
beep, beep, beep, beep,

16:34.294 --> 16:36.629
beepady, beep, beep, beepady,
beep, beep, beep, beep,

16:36.663 --> 16:39.599
beepady, beep, beep, beepady,
beep, beep, beep, beep...

16:42.135 --> 16:43.736
Some breaking news.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.439
Earlier today, a man was almost
hit with a flying microwave

16:46.473 --> 16:48.475
and a flying toaster

16:48.508 --> 16:50.310
and a flying dishwasher.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.113
And it turns out,
he deserved it.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.747
What happened to Vegas?

16:54.781 --> 16:57.817
NATHAN:
So this afternoon,
I sat down with that handsome,

16:57.850 --> 17:00.320
but flawed man
to get to the bottom of...

17:00.353 --> 17:03.290
why he always needed
to outshine his sister.

17:03.323 --> 17:06.126
Nathan, first,
thank you for being here.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.527
Thank you for
having me, Nathan.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.430
Oh, thank you...
for thanking me.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.599
All pleasantries aside,

17:12.632 --> 17:14.767
your sister said
some hurtful things, yes?

17:14.801 --> 17:16.269
Yes, she did.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.071
At first,
I thought she was crazy,

17:18.105 --> 17:20.307
but then, I started to wonder,
was she was right?

17:20.340 --> 17:22.642
And if so,
why was I acting that way?

17:22.675 --> 17:24.444
I'll ask the questions here.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.246
Was she right?

17:26.279 --> 17:28.348
And if so,
why were you acting that way?

17:28.381 --> 17:30.317
I'm not sure.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.852
But then, I was editing
some old home movies,

17:32.885 --> 17:35.622
and things started
to make sense.

17:35.655 --> 17:38.791
You see, in the beginning,
there was just me,

17:38.825 --> 17:41.461
the undisputed
number one child.

17:41.494 --> 17:44.864
I was the center
of the Miller universe.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.300
But then, one day,
a bright new star appeared--

17:47.334 --> 17:49.336
Baby Debbie.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.404
* Isn't she lovely?

17:51.438 --> 17:54.507
And Debbie, you were adorable.

17:54.541 --> 17:57.710
Perhaps too adorable.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.879
Because before I could realize
what was happening,

17:59.912 --> 18:02.582
I went from number one
to number two.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.718
TOM:
Nathan, stop
breathing on the baby.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.421
I knew that if I wanted Mom
and Dad's attention,

18:08.455 --> 18:09.656
I had to work harder.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.458
Breaking news!
Breaking news!

18:11.491 --> 18:13.860
This is Nathan Miller
reporting live from the scene

18:13.893 --> 18:15.795
of Debbie Miller's
first steps.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.397
Oh, how clever.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.532
Tom, are you
getting Nathan?

18:19.566 --> 18:21.834
Asked to comment
on her first steps,

18:21.868 --> 18:24.371
the youngest Miller said,
"Gaga googoo."

18:24.404 --> 18:26.873
And that's when I knew
I was onto something.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.742
And from there,
I ran with it.

18:31.578 --> 18:35.448
* Isn't she lovely?

18:35.482 --> 18:39.452
* Life and love are the same

18:39.486 --> 18:43.456
* Life is Aisha

18:43.490 --> 18:47.260
* The meaning of her name...

18:47.294 --> 18:51.398
I wasn't just out
shining men's shoes.

18:51.431 --> 18:54.467
I was outshining my sister.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.869
Debbie, what can I say?

18:56.903 --> 18:59.639
I've been an ass,
and I'm sorry.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.574
Please forgive me.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.676
Well, that seems very sincere.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.413
Debbie, whoever you are,

19:06.446 --> 19:08.181
your brother seems very sorry,

19:08.215 --> 19:10.217
and I think
you should forgive him.

19:10.250 --> 19:13.686
This is Nathan Miller
sitting in your basement.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.489
You made me an apology report.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.825
Well, I owed you one.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.361
And the whole reason
you have to be number one

19:21.394 --> 19:23.396
is because
you're insecure about me?

19:23.430 --> 19:24.597
Well, how can I not be?

19:24.631 --> 19:25.765
You're... you're
sweet, you're cute,

19:25.798 --> 19:27.434
you've got those
big, adorable eyes.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.370
You're like a puppy
made out of kittens.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.904
(laughs quietly)

19:31.938 --> 19:34.407
Got to work pretty hard
compete with that.

19:34.441 --> 19:37.944
Well, you've put up
a pretty good fight.

19:39.579 --> 19:42.515
Listen, I bet the appliance
store downtown is still open.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.784
What do you say we go
replace a few items?

19:44.817 --> 19:46.319
My treat.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.488
Okay, but, um, I'm only
letting you do this

19:48.521 --> 19:50.857
to build your
self-esteem, Mr. Big Shot.

19:50.890 --> 19:51.991
Wait a second.
I'm confused.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.527
I thought your mother
and I were here for an apology.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.563
Yeah, where's my apology report?

19:56.596 --> 20:00.233
No puppet show, no tap dance,
not even a lousy poem?

20:00.267 --> 20:02.502
For God sake, a haiku's
only 17 syllables,

20:02.535 --> 20:05.672
and it doesn't even need
to make sense.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.575
You know, Mom, after 42 years,
I finally realized

20:08.608 --> 20:11.444
that I... I don't need to be
so desperate to please everyone.

20:11.478 --> 20:12.812
So... I said I was sorry,

20:12.845 --> 20:14.681
and if that's not
good enough for you,

20:14.714 --> 20:17.584
then, you got to deal with it.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.687
Well, that was rude.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.655
I had a hug all

20:22.689 --> 20:24.591
locked and ready to go.

20:24.624 --> 20:27.794
Guess I can just use it
to bring in the trash can.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.829
Hmm.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.264
Where are Adam
and Mikayla?

20:31.298 --> 20:32.465
Her punishment was over,

20:32.499 --> 20:35.668
so he bought her a big bag of
candy and took her to a movie.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.470
What time was the movie?

20:37.504 --> 20:39.005
7:00, I think.

20:39.038 --> 20:41.808
You wan to have sex?

20:41.841 --> 20:43.543
Why not?

20:43.576 --> 20:45.044
But this is the last time.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.446
We got to stop this.

20:46.479 --> 20:49.282
We're supposed
to be divorced.
I know.

20:49.316 --> 20:51.951
Just need something
to spice up a Friday night.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.721
It's this, or we could
watch your old tapes

20:54.754 --> 20:56.756
of Matloc reruns.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.627
I'll get the tapes.
I'll get
the popcorn.
