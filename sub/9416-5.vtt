00:04.041 --> 00:05.166
Amy: Oh, he's so adorable.

00:05.750 --> 00:07.834
- It makes me wanna have another--
- All: No!

00:09.125 --> 00:10.750
...family photo taken.

00:11.917 --> 00:12.792
Bob: Oh.

00:13.041 --> 00:14.250
Okay, guys, listen up.

00:14.625 --> 00:18.375
If you could describe me in one word,
what would it be?

00:18.458 --> 00:20.500
Just say the first thing
that comes to your mind. Go.

00:20.917 --> 00:21.792
Spirited.

00:21.875 --> 00:23.333
- Annoying.
- Pushy.

00:23.417 --> 00:24.458
Sausage.

00:25.917 --> 00:27.166
Dad, what does that mean?

00:27.500 --> 00:29.959
That I want more sausage?
What... what are we talking about?

00:32.208 --> 00:33.667
What's with all the questions?

00:33.792 --> 00:35.583
Oh, it's for my college applications.

00:35.667 --> 00:37.583
I'm working on the most
important part of all...

00:37.667 --> 00:38.834
The personal essay.

00:38.917 --> 00:40.834
So, I have to write it
based on one of these topics.

00:40.917 --> 00:43.375
A single page. It could determine
my entire future.

00:43.458 --> 00:47.417
Five-hundred words that sum up
the essence of Teddy Duncan.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.041
- Long-winded.
- Boring.

00:49.125 --> 00:50.000
Sausage.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.250
Well, I still haven't got my sausage.

00:54.166 --> 00:55.750
Okay, topic number two.

00:55.834 --> 00:59.208
Who is the most influential
person in your life?

00:59.917 --> 01:01.000
Hello?

01:01.709 --> 01:03.333
Mom, why are you doing that?

01:03.709 --> 01:06.041
Oh, I'm sorry, would you prefer "ta-da",

01:06.125 --> 01:08.750
or, "ding, ding, ding!" or
"you're looking at her"?

01:10.125 --> 01:11.583
How about "not gonna happen"?

Hey, guys,

02:08.291 --> 02:09.166
check this out.

02:09.250 --> 02:11.250
AVM is coming to Colorado.

02:11.792 --> 02:13.709
Hey, that's great, Dad.

02:13.792 --> 02:14.875
What's AVM?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.458
Teddy, how many times
have we talked about this?

02:18.542 --> 02:20.166
No follow-up questions.

02:22.625 --> 02:26.208
AVM stands for Animal Vegetable, Mineral,

02:26.291 --> 02:28.625
one of the greatest bands of the '80s.

02:29.792 --> 02:33.250
They were a little bit punk,
a little bit metal, a little bit glam...

02:33.333 --> 02:34.542
I'm a little bit bored.

02:35.792 --> 02:37.875
And I scored two tickets.

02:37.959 --> 02:38.959
So,

02:39.041 --> 02:40.250
who wants to come with me?

02:40.792 --> 02:43.875
Oh Dad, I'd love to, but I have to work
on my College Essay.

02:44.625 --> 02:48.375
Oh yeah, and you know I probably should
start mine too, it's only four years away.

02:50.625 --> 02:53.583
You know what? You guys have no idea
what you're missing.

02:55.583 --> 02:56.458
Hey, guys.

02:56.542 --> 02:57.583
Hey, PJ.

02:57.667 --> 03:00.041
Oh, hey, dad's in the kitchen.

03:00.875 --> 03:03.375
If PJ wants to go into the kitchen...

03:04.458 --> 03:06.208
let him go into the kitchen.

03:08.417 --> 03:09.625
Hmm.

03:12.166 --> 03:13.458
I feel so dirty.

03:13.542 --> 03:14.959
It gets easier.

03:16.041 --> 03:18.083
Really?

03:25.500 --> 03:26.583
Are you Gabe Duncan?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.583
That depends. Who are you?

03:28.709 --> 03:29.917
My name's Devan.

03:30.917 --> 03:32.583
Are you gonna serve me with papers?

03:34.250 --> 03:35.750
No. I go to your old school.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.542
Lincoln Elementary.

03:37.625 --> 03:40.750
It's an honor to meet you, sir.
Your pranks are legendary.

03:41.250 --> 03:43.250
- It's Devan, you say?
- That's right.

03:43.834 --> 03:44.875
Come on in, Devan.

03:45.333 --> 03:46.959
I can't believe it's really you.

03:47.125 --> 03:50.834
You know people still talk about
the great toilet paper caper.

03:53.333 --> 03:54.583
One of my proudest moments.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.542
You know I made the principal cry.

03:57.417 --> 03:58.875
You can't put a price on that.

04:00.667 --> 04:02.500
I'm here because I need your help.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.500
I wanna prank one of my teachers.

04:04.917 --> 04:06.041
Oh, sorry, kid.

04:06.625 --> 04:08.250
My pranking days are over.

04:08.333 --> 04:11.208
But hey, thanks for the
trip down memory lane.

04:11.375 --> 04:13.667
Too bad. I was really
hoping to get Mr. Singer.

04:17.542 --> 04:18.959
Singer.

04:19.625 --> 04:22.500
Mr. Singer. I thought I'd never have
to hear that name again.

04:22.709 --> 04:25.709
- You know him?
- He was the meanest teacher I ever had.

04:26.417 --> 04:28.458
I created The Duncan Dunk just for him.

04:28.709 --> 04:32.625
The Duncan Dunk? It really does
exist? I thought it was just a myth.

04:34.542 --> 04:37.667
I dropped a bucket of glop on him
so foul-smelling...

04:38.041 --> 04:40.709
His wife made him live
in the garage for a month.

04:41.959 --> 04:43.667
But he paid me back.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.500
He made the rest of my 4th grade
year a living nightmare.

04:46.583 --> 04:49.125
He's doing the same thing to me.
I wanna get him.

04:49.208 --> 04:50.792
I wanna get him bad.

04:50.875 --> 04:52.834
I like your spirit, kid.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.125
But are you prepared to do what it takes?

04:55.208 --> 04:58.834
The hard work? The meticulous preparation?
The tireless training?

04:58.917 --> 05:00.250
What do you mean?

05:00.375 --> 05:01.583
We're gonna need about an hour.

05:02.083 --> 05:03.417
Come back tomorrow after school.

05:04.125 --> 05:05.709
All right. I'll be here...

05:06.417 --> 05:08.000
Gabe Duncan.

05:10.667 --> 05:14.625
Ah, just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

05:20.166 --> 05:21.875
Teddy: Okay, topic number three...

05:21.959 --> 05:23.458
Choose your most embarrassing moment,

05:23.542 --> 05:26.041
and write about how the experience
affected you.

05:26.125 --> 05:28.041
Most embarrassing moment.

05:28.125 --> 05:30.834
Most embarrassing moment...

05:40.917 --> 05:42.000
Teddy: Nothing there.

05:42.333 --> 05:43.208
Next question.

05:43.375 --> 05:46.417
Describe your family and the impact
they've had on your life.

05:55.500 --> 05:58.458
Teddy: Way too much there.

05:58.917 --> 06:00.083
Hey, honey.

06:00.291 --> 06:01.375
How's it going?

06:01.458 --> 06:02.792
Not too good.

06:02.875 --> 06:05.750
Still can't think of a topic
for my College Essay.

06:05.834 --> 06:07.542
Too bad you don't have one.

06:08.083 --> 06:09.875
Oh, but you do.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.250
"My mother, My star"?

06:17.083 --> 06:21.542
"The most influential person I know
is a lady with sparkle and glow.

06:21.625 --> 06:24.125
She may not be tall, but she's got it all.

06:24.208 --> 06:25.917
She even appears on a show.

06:26.458 --> 06:28.083
Good Morning, Denver. Weekdays at 8:00."

06:30.792 --> 06:33.250
How many essays are gonna open
with a limerick?

06:33.542 --> 06:34.667
Including mine?

06:35.375 --> 06:36.250
None.

06:38.542 --> 06:39.667
Amy: You'll be back.

06:41.041 --> 06:42.166
It's your room.

06:46.792 --> 06:47.917
Hey, Charlie.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.083
Where you going?

06:49.166 --> 06:51.000
- To a concert.
- The Gurgles?

06:51.875 --> 06:53.792
I wish.

06:53.875 --> 06:55.959
No, it's some old band Dad loves.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.333
I'm sorry.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.542
Well, I'm not.

07:00.333 --> 07:01.750
Dad does a lot of nice things for me.

07:02.583 --> 07:03.750
For all of us.

07:04.208 --> 07:06.166
I'm glad I have a chance
to do something for him.

07:06.333 --> 07:07.458
Bob: You ready, PJ?

07:12.417 --> 07:13.959
You never make it easy, do you, Dad?

07:16.083 --> 07:17.166
Who's that?

07:23.208 --> 07:27.375
So, Mr. Singer always enters
his classroom first thing in the morning.

07:27.792 --> 07:29.583
So, the bucket must be in place
the night before,

07:30.041 --> 07:31.083
which is tonight.

07:31.166 --> 07:32.125
Got it.

07:32.208 --> 07:33.458
Do you?

07:35.875 --> 07:38.333
What angle should the bucket be placed at?

07:38.417 --> 07:39.542
Um...

07:40.500 --> 07:41.458
I don't know.

07:43.291 --> 07:44.417
You...

07:44.500 --> 07:45.500
don't...

07:45.583 --> 07:46.667
know?

07:47.458 --> 07:49.750
I guess you don't got it , do you?

07:50.250 --> 07:51.750
No, Sir, I don't.

07:52.834 --> 07:56.166
The bucket has to be at a 45-degree angle.

07:56.250 --> 07:58.917
And the door has to be open
exactly three inches.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.166
Not two.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.458
Not four.

08:01.542 --> 08:02.500
Three.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.583
Forty-five degrees, three inches.

08:05.667 --> 08:09.000
Remember... pranking is not just an art,
it's also a science.

08:09.542 --> 08:13.500
I should know. I came up with this prank
while flunking Art and Science.

08:14.834 --> 08:16.417
I'm flunking those too!

08:16.750 --> 08:18.709
No way. Nice!

08:19.959 --> 08:22.375
Okay. Now, let's talk glop.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.375
Here are your ingredients.

08:24.458 --> 08:25.291
Water-based paint,

08:25.875 --> 08:27.375
tuna oil for the smell,

08:27.750 --> 08:29.458
molasses for the consistency.

08:30.250 --> 08:32.166
and of course, pancake batter.

08:32.500 --> 08:33.500
Pancake batter?

08:33.875 --> 08:37.333
If there's a better way to hold chicken
gizzards together, I have not heard it.

08:39.750 --> 08:40.875
There's one more thing.

08:47.417 --> 08:50.041
Wow. One of your famous skull hoodies.

08:51.166 --> 08:52.917
I want you to wear that tomorrow.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.375
When Mr. Singer wipes
away that blinding glob,

08:55.458 --> 08:58.709
I want the first thing he sees
to be that skull.

08:58.792 --> 08:59.917
Then he'll know.

09:05.542 --> 09:06.500
With all due respect, sir,

09:06.917 --> 09:08.000
what happened to you?

09:08.625 --> 09:11.500
You know, I have no idea.
I come from a really nice family.

09:23.291 --> 09:25.792
Ha! I am so ready to rock.

09:26.875 --> 09:27.875
Okay,

09:28.250 --> 09:30.959
let me tell you a little bit about AVM.

09:31.041 --> 09:32.333
Little as possible, please.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.500
Boys in the band.

09:34.917 --> 09:39.000
You got Mineral, A.K.A. legendary
drummer, Cliff Ledge.

09:39.625 --> 09:43.875
Then there's lead singer,
Vegetable A.K.A. Russell Sprouts.

09:45.583 --> 09:47.083
What's animal's name?

09:47.166 --> 09:48.041
Steve.

09:50.375 --> 09:53.166
Oh, man. This traffic is awful.

09:54.208 --> 09:55.500
Oh, you know what?

09:55.583 --> 09:57.667
Good thing your old man knows a shortcut.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.792
Oh... are you sure about this?

10:01.250 --> 10:02.917
- Shouldn't we stay on the main road?
- No!

10:03.250 --> 10:04.709
We can't be late.

10:04.792 --> 10:07.875
They open every show with their
haunting ballad "She's a Heifer".

10:10.083 --> 10:11.709
Song always makes me cry.

10:17.291 --> 10:19.208
First of all, let me just say...

10:20.542 --> 10:21.667
Welcome, neighbors.

10:22.125 --> 10:23.458
Thank you for coming.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.625
As I'm sure you all know,

10:28.291 --> 10:30.083
I am applying to college.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.125
Well, I am.

10:35.875 --> 10:36.875
So,

10:36.959 --> 10:39.834
I've decided to write my
college essay on the topic...

10:40.792 --> 10:43.875
"How have my neighbors shaped me
into the person I am today?"

10:44.583 --> 10:45.959
And that's where you guys come in.

10:46.041 --> 10:47.458
I have a question.

10:47.834 --> 10:48.959
Who are they?

10:50.333 --> 10:51.834
They're your neighbors, Bert.

10:52.166 --> 10:53.458
Hence the words,

10:53.542 --> 10:54.875
"welcome, neighbors".

10:56.959 --> 10:58.792
I'm Estelle Dabney.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.291
And I'm Debbie Dooley. How you doing?

11:01.583 --> 11:03.959
How am I doing? You really wanna know?

11:04.583 --> 11:07.083
It's just a catchphrase I use, so...

11:07.792 --> 11:09.000
no, thanks.

11:10.667 --> 11:12.333
Ladies, this is Bert Dugan.

11:12.417 --> 11:13.917
I know who he is.

11:14.208 --> 11:17.083
He mows his lawn in those tiny shorts.

11:21.709 --> 11:25.250
You know what I always think
is a fun fashion option?

11:26.083 --> 11:27.333
Pants.

11:29.417 --> 11:31.959
Okay, all right, we're
getting a little bit off topic.

11:32.041 --> 11:34.208
Let's get back to the shaping.

11:34.667 --> 11:36.333
Okay, so...

11:36.834 --> 11:39.542
"What's the most valuable
life lesson you've learned?"

11:40.208 --> 11:41.667
Never marry a redhead.

11:41.750 --> 11:42.834
Or a deputy.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.000
Or Fred Dabney.

11:47.166 --> 11:50.375
Okay, guys, look, we've been living
next to each other for all these years.

11:50.458 --> 11:51.792
There must be some sort of

11:52.750 --> 11:54.875
impact we've had on each other's lives.

11:55.458 --> 11:58.458
- I'd like to say something.
- Great, Bert, get us started.

11:58.792 --> 12:00.583
Your Christmas lights are still up.

12:01.417 --> 12:02.250
Up?

12:02.375 --> 12:05.041
like those tiny, tiny shorts you wear.

12:05.667 --> 12:08.208
Why, it's like the South of France
right here in Denver.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.333
As long as we're complaining,

12:12.417 --> 12:14.834
why do you leave your trash cans
on the street?

12:14.917 --> 12:17.625
- I never know when they're coming.
- Pickup is Tuesday.

12:17.709 --> 12:19.792
Both: It's always Tuesday.

12:20.375 --> 12:24.583
Yeah? What about holiday weeks, huh?
Oh, you didn't think about that, did you?

12:24.709 --> 12:26.417
Well, think about this.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.208
Guys, stop. Stop it.

12:31.333 --> 12:34.667
Stop fighting and start shaping me.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.458
You know, I used to think you were
the good one,

12:39.542 --> 12:42.542
but you're just as bad as Abe and RJ.

12:43.041 --> 12:45.959
- It's Gabe and PJ.
- Who cares? I'm out of here.

12:46.417 --> 12:47.625
Right behind you.

12:48.875 --> 12:52.125
Thanks for having us over.
Hope that helped.

12:52.834 --> 12:53.959
It didn't...

12:54.458 --> 12:55.542
at all.

12:56.125 --> 12:58.291
Just another catchphrase, Sweetie.

12:59.041 --> 13:00.166
Bye, now.

13:15.250 --> 13:17.375
Gee, this road's getting
kind of narrow, huh?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.250
Dad, we're not on a road.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.250
We're driving in the woods.

13:22.750 --> 13:24.709
It says it's a road on the GPS.

13:24.917 --> 13:26.792
It says projected road.

13:29.500 --> 13:32.333
Okay, all right. Maybe we should
just get back on the main drag.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.542
Great. Stuck in the mud.

13:38.625 --> 13:39.583
Now what?

13:40.125 --> 13:41.542
No problem. No problem.

13:41.625 --> 13:44.041
I paid extra for roadside assistance.
Let's see what they can do.

13:46.250 --> 13:49.125
operator 1: Roadside assistance.
What is your life-threatening emergency?

13:49.333 --> 13:51.959
Yes. We're late for an AVM concert!

13:53.417 --> 13:54.750
Please hold.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.542
- You think she's coming back?
- I wouldn't.

14:12.208 --> 14:14.917
Teddy: Okay. Question five.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.625
If you could go back in time,

14:16.709 --> 14:20.333
what period of history
would you choose and why?

14:23.250 --> 14:25.166
Teddy: Oh, I need a break.

14:25.250 --> 14:26.792
Maybe I'll take a little catnap.

14:27.375 --> 14:28.959
Wake up ready to go.

14:41.250 --> 14:43.875
Oh, look what Charlie drew.

14:44.083 --> 14:45.250
Oh!

14:45.333 --> 14:47.083
Isn't that cute. It's a...

14:48.000 --> 14:48.959
It's a...

14:49.250 --> 14:50.500
help me out here.

14:50.875 --> 14:52.917
I think it's a hunter chasing a dinosaur.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.417
Oh, Charlie.

14:55.041 --> 14:57.917
Honey, dinosaurs have been extinct
for like three years.

15:01.875 --> 15:03.083
Oh, there he is.

15:03.792 --> 15:04.792
Did you find a job yet?

15:04.875 --> 15:06.083
No.

15:06.166 --> 15:08.083
It jungle out there.

15:09.750 --> 15:11.375
Why does he talk like that?

15:11.625 --> 15:13.625
He's not as evolved as we are.

15:21.959 --> 15:23.250
My Queen.

15:23.375 --> 15:24.250
May I present...

15:25.000 --> 15:26.208
the fool.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.208
Yeah, about that.

15:28.917 --> 15:30.041
Silence.

15:30.375 --> 15:32.083
Amuse me. Tell me a joke.

15:32.166 --> 15:34.542
And it better be funny
or it's off with your heads.

15:36.250 --> 15:37.542
- You go first.
- Oh, that's good.

15:37.875 --> 15:39.542
I've been working on a new type of joke.

15:39.625 --> 15:40.542
Okay.

15:40.875 --> 15:41.959
Knock, knock.

15:43.417 --> 15:44.667
Who's there?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.333
That's as far as I got.

15:48.291 --> 15:49.792
Executioner?

15:52.250 --> 15:53.667
Tough Castle, hmm?

16:00.625 --> 16:02.125
Swell breakfast, Mom.

16:02.208 --> 16:03.750
Oh, thanks, Hon.

16:03.959 --> 16:06.166
This little sport sure seems to think so.

16:07.875 --> 16:09.250
Hey, swell tie, Pop.

16:09.625 --> 16:10.834
Thanks, Champ.

16:12.083 --> 16:13.250
I love Toby.

16:14.083 --> 16:16.083
Well, of course you do, sweetheart.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.917
Everyone's always happy in the '50s.

16:21.625 --> 16:23.583
Look what I learned
at the sock hop last night.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.667
Gabe: Whoa.

16:29.750 --> 16:31.417
- Golly.
- Oh, jeez.

16:31.500 --> 16:32.417
Bob: Ha!

16:32.500 --> 16:34.834
When is something
interesting gonna happen?

16:34.917 --> 16:37.625
You don't think this is interesting?

16:38.166 --> 16:39.166
No.

16:39.250 --> 16:41.542
I don't, and I need something
for my essay.

16:42.041 --> 16:44.500
Now, Teddy, maybe you should just
forget that old essay.

16:44.583 --> 16:46.667
Skip college, stay home with the family.

16:47.417 --> 16:49.333
No, I can't stay home!

16:49.417 --> 16:51.000
I gotta get out of here.

17:05.709 --> 17:07.041
Yeah, nice bedhead.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.250
Executioner?

17:12.500 --> 17:14.250
Oh, those were the days.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.083
Bob: We made it!

17:22.166 --> 17:23.917
Hey, excuse me.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.375
Excuse me. Pardon me. Oh! Excuse me.
Pardon me. Excuse me.

17:27.875 --> 17:30.041
Man, hope we didn't miss too much.

17:30.125 --> 17:32.208
Russell Sprouts: We're AVM! Good night!

17:46.458 --> 17:48.583
Hey, all right, I'm here.
What's the problem?

17:48.959 --> 17:50.792
Um, I can't figure out the bucket.

17:51.750 --> 17:56.041
See, this is what happens when you
send a boy to do an older boy's job.

17:57.542 --> 17:59.875
- So, where is the bucket?
- It's inside.

18:00.417 --> 18:02.375
All right. Watch and learn, little man.

18:05.750 --> 18:06.625
Ha!

18:11.792 --> 18:13.208
What just happened here?

18:13.458 --> 18:14.792
I'll tell you what happened.

18:14.917 --> 18:16.667
Duncan got dunked.

18:18.709 --> 18:21.250
You set me up.
I thought you hated Mr. Singer.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.125
You mean, Uncle Rick?

18:27.250 --> 18:29.542
I trusted you, and you betrayed me.

18:31.917 --> 18:32.834
Nice work.

18:36.041 --> 18:39.083
I've waited four years
to get you back, Duncan.

18:40.166 --> 18:42.667
- I guess we're finally even.
- I guess we are.

18:43.875 --> 18:44.750
For now.

18:51.083 --> 18:52.125
Did he say...

18:52.458 --> 18:53.667
"for now"?

18:53.750 --> 18:54.709
Mm-hmm.

18:55.417 --> 18:57.333
Sweet Mama, what have I done?

19:05.333 --> 19:06.458
Well...

19:07.333 --> 19:09.583
That was the worst night ever.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.542
It's in the top five.

19:16.583 --> 19:17.875
And we're...

19:18.500 --> 19:19.792
out of gas.

19:19.875 --> 19:20.709
Top three.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.500
Both: Oh.

19:27.583 --> 19:31.291
PJ, I am so sorry I dragged
you along on this awful night.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.625
It's my fault for
walking into the kitchen.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.208
Oh, right.

19:36.583 --> 19:38.792
Guess I should
call roadside assistance again.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.458
I think we're still on hold.

19:46.458 --> 19:48.458
- Should we wait?
- I wouldn't.

19:54.250 --> 19:55.834
Is that a tour bus?

19:55.917 --> 19:57.083
There's somebody getting out.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.208
Russell Sprouts: You blokes need a ride?

20:03.208 --> 20:04.959
My sweet Lord.

20:05.041 --> 20:06.500
It's Russell Sprouts!

20:08.417 --> 20:09.458
Do I look okay?

20:09.875 --> 20:11.125
How's my makeup?

20:21.417 --> 20:22.625
Are you sad?

20:23.583 --> 20:25.750
Yeah, Charlie. I am.

20:26.250 --> 20:27.250
Why?

20:27.375 --> 20:30.458
Well, because I can't think of what
to write for my College Essay.

20:30.667 --> 20:32.583
I know what you could write about.

20:32.667 --> 20:33.542
Yeah?

20:33.875 --> 20:34.750
What?

20:34.834 --> 20:35.875
Mommy.

20:37.125 --> 20:39.417
Really? Did mommy tell you to say that?

20:39.500 --> 20:40.500
No comment.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.083
Okay.

20:43.166 --> 20:46.125
Well, you tell mommy
I'll figure something out.

20:46.542 --> 20:48.125
Okay. Good luck, Teddy.

20:50.709 --> 20:51.834
Good luck, Teddy.

20:52.709 --> 20:53.959
That's it!

20:54.041 --> 20:56.625
I can't believe I didn't think of that
before. It's perfect.

21:01.333 --> 21:02.667
Well, Charlie.

21:02.750 --> 21:06.041
I just sent in my first
college application.

21:06.375 --> 21:12.000
And thanks to you, I finally came up
with a great topic for my essay.

21:12.083 --> 21:14.458
It's all about these video diaries
I've been doing.

21:14.542 --> 21:15.458
See...

21:15.542 --> 21:19.041
I realized that I started making them
to help you.

21:19.125 --> 21:20.792
But as I went along,

21:20.875 --> 21:22.750
I learned a lot about myself.

21:23.041 --> 21:25.291
And our crazy...

21:25.375 --> 21:26.917
wonderful family.

21:27.625 --> 21:28.583
Richie?

21:28.667 --> 21:30.792
You're not gonna believe
who I met last night.

21:30.875 --> 21:32.542
Russell Sprouts.

21:33.917 --> 21:36.208
I know! I know! It was amazing.

21:36.291 --> 21:37.792
We shared eyeliner tips.

21:37.875 --> 21:39.083
Oh, yes, we did.

21:39.166 --> 21:40.792
Yes, we did!

21:44.500 --> 21:46.667
Sometimes more crazy than wonderful.

21:47.583 --> 21:48.750
Good luck, Charlie.
