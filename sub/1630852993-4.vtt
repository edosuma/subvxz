Thanks. How's your
yoga, Gramsy?

10:20.119 --> 10:23.205
Not great. I think
I bruised my booty bone.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.709
And it was nice to
have a quiet house
for a little bit.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.962
But maybe it was
a little too quiet.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.715
Wanna hang out in
The Besties Bus with us?

10:32.798 --> 10:35.176
I'd say I thought
you'd never ask,

10:35.259 --> 10:38.387
but to be honest,
I knew you would. [laughs]
