02:11.340 --> 02:15.427
In the 16th century, after the
capture ofatahua/pa,

02:15.510 --> 02:19.473
there were still tribes that did not
surrender to the conquerors.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.685
To counter Spanish's firearms,

02:23.769 --> 02:30.192
masters of the rumi maki tried to spread
a deadly technique amongst the incas:

02:30.275 --> 02:32.194
"The fist of the condor".

02:38.158 --> 02:41.244
But the Spanish stole the sacred manual.

02:41.328 --> 02:46.208
The few remaining rebels gave
their lives rescuing the book,

02:46.291 --> 02:51.088
and the only survivor escaped with it
so it'd never fall into wrong hands again.

02:51.922 --> 02:56.093
The legend says he hid in a mountain
in the southern part of the world.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.721
Whoever had an honest heart
would inherit the technique.

03:00.305 --> 03:04.184
This is how the manual has been passed
down from generation to generation.

03:04.768 --> 03:09.398
These warriors are called
"masters of the fist of the condor".

03:41.221 --> 03:43.098
I haven't fought in six years.

03:44.850 --> 03:48.061
I needed time, but it was too much.

03:50.689 --> 03:53.859
Sooner or later, someone would arrive
looking for the same thing.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.904
What all lost warriors seek.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.731
I have to be ready.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.026
Ready if he finds me,

04:36.693 --> 04:38.737
or if! Find him.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.979
I feel my body working like a clock.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.107
Like a race car.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.317
I feed it the best.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.655
I've spent years calibrating myself.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.616
I've been my own experiment.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.078
Until I found balance.

05:30.205 --> 05:33.291
Anything less, I would lose voltage.

05:35.210 --> 05:38.755
Anything more would slow me down.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.586
He knows about my photophobia, but how?

06:19.838 --> 06:21.506
It's not just blindness.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.925
It's intense pain.

06:34.269 --> 06:38.899
You are not the best. Not the fastest.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.608
Master, but you told me...

06:40.609 --> 06:43.486
It was what you needed to hear.

06:45.697 --> 06:46.990
So now what?

06:47.616 --> 06:52.537
Get on with your life. Keep training.

06:53.038 --> 06:59.544
Don't look for him until you're ready.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.797
I'm going to find him and defeat him.

07:03.798 --> 07:07.302
You will not be able to.
You still don't understand.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.847
He is the perfect fighter.

07:12.432 --> 07:18.647
With your conventional training,
you have no chance.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.442
What scares me is how much you admire him.

07:23.193 --> 07:29.157
How can I not admire the purity
of his martial arts?

07:29.908 --> 07:35.580
Years training in the mountains.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.959
Everything he sacrificed
to become what he is.

07:40.460 --> 07:46.591
He defeated his own teachers
and feels no guilt.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.886
He left his conscience behind.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.306
He does not follow doctrines or laws.

07:54.891 --> 07:57.310
He is an animal!

08:00.522 --> 08:02.440
I don't buy those cheap stories.

08:04.109 --> 08:06.361
Save them for your younger students.

08:06.903 --> 08:07.946
Wait.

08:08.613 --> 08:11.616
They say he has
the same achilles heel as his brother.

08:27.173 --> 08:30.468
"You got to understand you are nothing",
the master used to say.

08:30.719 --> 08:34.014
You have nothing to prove,
nothing to defend.

08:34.556 --> 08:37.726
Look at your pain.
Look at it from its core.

08:37.809 --> 08:40.186
Inhabit it and transform yourself into it.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.891
Let your weight take you to the bottom.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.941
Throw everything away
until you are weightless.

09:28.109 --> 09:31.613
Throw everything away except your dignity.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.991
And your weightless body will fly.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.003
Breath in

09:47.504 --> 09:50.381
and fight with the only thing
you kept for yourself.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.507
The stories about you were true...

10:32.966 --> 10:34.342
All of them.

10:35.593 --> 10:36.970
Who do you think I am?

10:37.262 --> 10:39.556
The master of the fist of the condor.

10:41.599 --> 10:42.934
No, it's not me.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.520
It is my twin brother.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.731
And I want to kill him too.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.615
This was a sign.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.369
And I can see the path again.

11:02.537 --> 11:05.415
I have come too far to give up who I am.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.876
It's time to keep looking for him.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.259
I was lost, but was meditating.

11:16.676 --> 11:21.055
Now I know where the sun sets,
and where it will rise the next day.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.334
At what point exactly
did I leave my original path?

11:50.126 --> 11:54.464
I am not the man I wanted to be.
Nor the man I was before.

11:56.132 --> 11:59.469
It isn't his fault. I can't blame him.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.554
I can't blame anyone.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.766
Although sometimes I think
he sends them...

12:16.486 --> 12:18.529
I am not the one you are looking for.

12:35.296 --> 12:38.423
Repeat it. Repeat it a thousand times

12:38.424 --> 12:41.010
until your nervous system
makes it its own.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.013
Until it becomes a reflex,

12:44.472 --> 12:46.599
an electrical impulse.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.443
I'll tell you for the last time.

12:57.819 --> 12:59.529
I am not the one.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.447
They told me he was in this town,

13:01.698 --> 13:02.948
and here you are.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.367
I know your face.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.619
You're after my brother.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.288
That's a lie, you don't have a brother.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.624
You just say that
so we don't take your book.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.587
What book?

13:17.088 --> 13:19.506
The manual you stole
from the school of the condor.

13:19.507 --> 13:20.717
Give it to me!

13:23.469 --> 13:25.722
You'll have to keep looking.

13:33.396 --> 13:34.647
The book!

13:39.694 --> 13:40.945
And now what?

13:41.446 --> 13:43.448
Open your own school

13:44.032 --> 13:48.411
or go around the world
challenging masters.

13:49.954 --> 13:54.667
I know you're keeping a secret.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.547
That's what you are talking about...

14:04.427 --> 14:06.471
Shortly after my last Dan,

14:09.182 --> 14:14.479
I dueled a vagabond.

14:15.730 --> 14:21.194
And what I saw was
out of any martial arts fantasy.

14:22.403 --> 14:26.366
He trampled me as if I were a worm.

14:27.450 --> 14:30.536
Instead of getting mad,

14:31.579 --> 14:35.416
I asked him to be my teacher,
but he told me that it was not his path.

14:36.876 --> 14:42.215
And before he left,
he told me in a low voice,

14:43.591 --> 14:48.679
"lost in the mountains,

14:49.639 --> 14:53.309
in the southern part of the world,

14:54.769 --> 14:58.898
there is a school
that defies the laws of gravity."

15:01.109 --> 15:02.109
Did you look for it?

15:03.194 --> 15:07.073
It is a school you cannot pay to attend.

15:08.282 --> 15:13.538
The master chooses his students
by their honest hearts.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.540
Did he choose you?

15:16.541 --> 15:18.583
Yes, he did.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.087
When I was there,
there were only two students.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.424
Myself and a woman who the master named

15:25.174 --> 15:26.717
"the condor woman".

15:28.052 --> 15:30.805
He named me "the worm man".

15:31.431 --> 15:33.141
Can you guess how the story ends?

15:34.517 --> 15:36.726
The condor ate the worm.

15:36.727 --> 15:38.607
Not just that.
I ended up seeing a psychiatrist.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.023
And his explanation for my failure was

15:42.567 --> 15:45.778
that my mind was too structured.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.662
And what do you mean
by "defies the laws of gravity"?

16:00.418 --> 16:02.837
I want to find that book
as much as you do.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.093
Give me the bag!

17:09.195 --> 17:10.863
Maybe he is sending them,

17:10.947 --> 17:12.365
but not this one.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.117
Firearms are not his style.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.335
"Forgive him", master wook told me.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.505
But he also told me that he was the devil.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.758
Is it possible to forgive the devil?

17:31.968 --> 17:33.177
Maybe.

17:33.928 --> 17:36.055
But first I have to find him

17:36.889 --> 17:38.516
and look him straight in the eyes.

18:05.376 --> 18:07.128
So he is back on the road.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.300
Is he still on that motorcycle
pretending to be the renegade?

18:12.383 --> 18:14.093
Yes, he is.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.262
And he shaved his head like a monk.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.265
I'm not surprised.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.476
He must be insane by now.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.062
Insane or not,

18:27.690 --> 18:29.859
the rumor is that he used
the fist of the condor.

18:36.741 --> 18:40.995
The question is how he used that technique
if there is only one manual, right?

18:42.788 --> 18:43.831
Well...

18:45.124 --> 18:47.335
It would appear the old lady made a copy.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.089
But there should be just one copy.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.258
That's what you taught me.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.303
The one who was able to protect
the book deserved it.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.725
Clearly, someone broke the tradition.

19:04.435 --> 19:06.020
Or you think they took it from me?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.649
May I ask you a question?

19:11.651 --> 19:13.444
I hope you don't get offended, but...

19:16.906 --> 19:18.574
Are you sure you have it?

19:25.790 --> 19:27.333
I am sorry, master.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.087
Find my brother.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.130
Take the manual from him.

19:35.216 --> 19:36.801
If you can defeat him,

19:37.718 --> 19:39.470
the book will be your reward.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.350
Didn't you want to kill him yourself?

19:45.935 --> 19:48.521
Only if he defeats you,
he would deserve to confront me.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.905
I'm afraid I'll have to deprive
you of that pleasure.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.870
He deserves to get his revenge

20:06.997 --> 20:08.833
and I deserve his punishment.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.712
And in return,

20:14.547 --> 20:16.298
I deserve my revenge

20:18.634 --> 20:20.511
and he deserves my punishment.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.190
Training in a fasted state.

20:34.525 --> 20:37.278
Fasting activates survival instincts,

20:37.862 --> 20:39.780
animal instincts.

20:39.864 --> 20:44.118
The brain is alert and the senses
are enhanced. You're ready to hunt.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.109
"Watch the outside,

21:59.944 --> 22:01.612
but more importantly,

22:01.904 --> 22:05.282
watch the inside", master would say.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.665
What's in there?

22:13.791 --> 22:16.460
Is the evil guest still in there?

22:51.245 --> 22:53.539
I'm going to show you something new.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.676
The logs.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.481
Show us.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.293
That is the first step.

23:40.586 --> 23:44.298
The second step
requires you to get rid of the evil guest,

23:44.924 --> 23:45.924
the ego.

23:46.550 --> 23:49.553
You must get rid of it
to reduce your weight.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.722
Remove the logs!

23:59.063 --> 24:01.231
It's physically impossible,

24:01.941 --> 24:04.443
but that's because you think you know.

24:05.194 --> 24:08.364
The worst ego trap is
believing that you know.

24:10.324 --> 24:11.617
Jump!

24:26.507 --> 24:33.138
Feeling important makes you
heavy, clumsy, and futile.

24:33.847 --> 24:37.518
To be a warrior
you need to be light and fluid.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.154
The ego

25:31.155 --> 25:33.032
is the inner Satan.

25:34.491 --> 25:36.451
If you want to kill him,

25:36.452 --> 25:38.287
you have to see him first.

25:39.246 --> 25:41.457
That's what meditation is for.

26:29.880 --> 26:33.759
They asked me if I was the crazy guy
who believes he is caine from kung fu.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.554
They say there's a crazy guy out there

26:38.305 --> 26:39.765
that likes to beat people up.

26:41.225 --> 26:43.644
Challenging whoever crosses his path.

26:44.728 --> 26:47.009
A nice kick in the balls
is what I'm gonna give that mofo.

27:08.544 --> 27:10.462
Some water, please.

27:10.587 --> 27:11.755
Water?

27:12.881 --> 27:14.007
Is this the guy?

27:15.676 --> 27:17.928
Instead of caine he looks like a dickhead.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.180
Look at him.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.934
Who the heck does he think he is?

27:26.937 --> 27:28.730
He smells like shit!

27:29.648 --> 27:31.482
Hey, no need...

27:31.483 --> 27:32.901
Relax, dude.

27:36.238 --> 27:38.157
There are people eating lunch.

27:39.616 --> 27:41.994
We don't want anyone smelling like shit.

27:47.583 --> 27:49.168
It's best to shower

27:50.502 --> 27:52.212
to get that smell off of you.

27:55.090 --> 27:56.884
Get out of here, you fucking freak!

28:06.476 --> 28:09.146
Wow! Jackie chan! Wow!

30:45.635 --> 30:47.846
He is going to take the book.

30:54.644 --> 30:57.022
He is going to take the manual.

31:47.531 --> 31:48.657
Hey, babe.

31:49.199 --> 31:50.242
Hey.

31:51.118 --> 31:52.160
Hey!

31:52.536 --> 31:54.662
Check this out.

31:54.663 --> 31:56.706
Hey, babe.

31:57.290 --> 31:58.333
Hey.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.837
You look too good to be with him.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.756
Come sit with me, honey.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.051
Cut it, or I'll smash your teeth.

32:09.553 --> 32:12.305
Wow! Let's see it. Come get me.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.399
A beer, please.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.236
This freak again.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.537
What did I tell you?

32:38.123 --> 32:40.249
You can leave now and walk out like a man

32:40.250 --> 32:42.419
or stay and be dragged out like a dog.

32:46.506 --> 32:49.384
What you think is bravery
is just your insecurity.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.304
You need to prove yourself superior.

32:52.679 --> 32:55.640
But you won't be able
to prove that against me.

32:59.728 --> 33:03.899
I should have said this earlier,
but I'm not a monk.

33:04.524 --> 33:06.525
Do you want to walk out like a man,

33:06.526 --> 33:08.820
or be dragged out like a dog?

33:19.331 --> 33:21.333
You bought me a beer earlier.

33:21.917 --> 33:23.460
This round is on me.

33:36.097 --> 33:39.893
Hey guys! Come on!
Let's kill this freak! Let's go!

34:50.171 --> 34:51.673
I know your master.

34:57.137 --> 35:00.140
Why don't you just hand over
the fist of the condor?

35:01.975 --> 35:03.893
It's a little cramped in here.

35:05.228 --> 35:08.063
In the abandoned warehouse
near the school.

35:08.064 --> 35:11.192
Five in the morning. It will be an honor.

35:12.152 --> 35:13.528
So be it.

35:20.660 --> 35:25.123
When a warrior decides to do something,
he must know why he does it.

35:25.582 --> 35:29.793
Only then can he focus every cell
in his body on the task that lies ahead.

35:29.794 --> 35:34.424
He knows that if he wastes his strength,
he could be crushed like a twig.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.598
I should meditate and fast until the duel.

35:42.265 --> 35:45.060
I fasted, but I could not meditate.

35:45.894 --> 35:47.520
I was only able to remember.

35:54.027 --> 35:56.655
Master wook told me about the school.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.699
I shouldn't have told anyone,

36:00.200 --> 36:01.993
but I told my brother.

36:03.244 --> 36:04.829
We made a pact.

36:06.331 --> 36:09.083
If they chose just one of us,

36:09.084 --> 36:11.752
the other one would accept it without envy
or resentment towards the other,

36:11.753 --> 36:14.923
and he would wait
until the training was finished.

36:15.423 --> 36:19.302
When the chosen one finished his training,
he would share everything he had learned.

36:55.255 --> 36:57.716
They are listening to the earth.

37:06.516 --> 37:09.185
You stay.

37:10.895 --> 37:12.605
Youleave.

37:17.861 --> 37:19.738
But it's unfair.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.240
He has more talent than me.

37:22.949 --> 37:25.200
Talent is not what matters here.

37:25.201 --> 37:27.328
What matters is the passion.

37:28.830 --> 37:32.458
The passion of the warrior,
talented or not,

37:32.459 --> 37:36.671
is what makes him reach the top,
even if his mountain is higher.

38:05.742 --> 38:06.742
And you?

38:07.994 --> 38:09.245
Do you have passion?

38:11.456 --> 38:12.624
Yes.

38:13.374 --> 38:16.044
Then you will start off in the kitchen.

38:21.841 --> 38:23.384
Hey, birdie!

38:26.304 --> 38:28.389
Always be on the lookout.

38:29.182 --> 38:32.393
You must see with your body,
not just your eyes.

38:32.894 --> 38:37.398
To remember this,
keep your index finger down.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.249
Birdie!

39:43.089 --> 39:44.424
Beautiful!

39:47.802 --> 39:49.178
Birdie,

39:49.637 --> 39:54.766
you have worked hard, without complaint
and with passion for a whole year.

39:54.767 --> 39:57.770
Now I want you
to begin learning martial arts.

40:48.655 --> 40:49.906
Who is it?

40:53.034 --> 40:54.661
You don't recognize him?

41:00.667 --> 41:02.085
My brother?

41:03.795 --> 41:06.381
It turned out that he had
a lot of passion. Don't you think?

41:14.347 --> 41:16.182
Who are you training?

41:17.517 --> 41:18.851
Him or me?

42:00.476 --> 42:02.270
Do you like watching him?

42:04.605 --> 42:06.024
I feel sorry for him.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.986
That's exactly how we live our lives,

42:10.069 --> 42:12.405
but our cage is invisible.

42:14.449 --> 42:16.284
Why don't you set him free?

42:17.493 --> 42:19.327
I have opened the cage,

42:19.328 --> 42:20.912
but he comes back.

42:20.913 --> 42:22.957
He prefers safety.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.627
What could happen to him?

42:27.211 --> 42:28.713
His brother

42:29.297 --> 42:31.340
was eaten by a condor.

42:39.807 --> 42:41.851
Do you know where to find him?

42:42.643 --> 42:44.353
He is by the coast.

42:45.855 --> 42:47.648
Don't forget,

42:50.359 --> 42:53.738
you will only be able to defeat him
if you get inside of his head.

42:59.202 --> 43:00.953
What can I say to him?

43:03.498 --> 43:07.460
Bring him a souvenir from his master.

43:09.879 --> 43:11.422
Master wook?

43:11.839 --> 43:13.633
Wook was like his father.

43:16.469 --> 43:18.054
Excuse me, master.

43:20.807 --> 43:22.391
May I ask you another question?

43:23.434 --> 43:27.396
I know it doesn't concern me,
but it might help to mess with his mind.

43:31.567 --> 43:33.653
What did you do to your brother?

43:42.954 --> 43:45.206
Forgive him.

43:47.542 --> 43:48.542
Or...

43:53.089 --> 43:55.842
Are you going to live for revenge?

44:03.224 --> 44:04.767
It's not revenge.

44:07.145 --> 44:08.604
Then what is it?

44:12.441 --> 44:14.985
He doesn't deserve the fist of the condor.

44:14.986 --> 44:18.281
But he has it.

44:19.615 --> 44:21.868
And he had everything that was mine.

44:34.964 --> 44:36.465
Stay.

44:44.056 --> 44:45.683
I'll be back.

45:11.751 --> 45:14.086
I won't talk to her about you anymore.

45:31.854 --> 45:34.190
Why did you leave them?

45:35.816 --> 45:38.068
The path of the warrior
must be traveled with no luggage.

45:38.069 --> 45:43.699
Who told you that foolishness?

45:46.702 --> 45:53.042
A warrior follows the path he wants,
however he wants to follow it.

46:25.032 --> 46:26.575
Who's there?

46:32.623 --> 46:34.000
Good evening.

46:34.417 --> 46:36.043
What can I do for you?

46:37.128 --> 46:38.921
I'm looking for a souvenir.

46:39.422 --> 46:40.715
What?

46:49.890 --> 46:52.601
I am a student
at the school of the condor.

46:59.317 --> 47:00.651
The school

47:02.528 --> 47:04.447
that you failed to finish.

47:06.073 --> 47:09.701
At least in those days it was
an honorable school.

47:09.702 --> 47:13.247
Today it's a school for assassins.

47:19.670 --> 47:21.589
You may be right.

47:24.050 --> 47:24.925
This is my duel.

47:24.926 --> 47:26.010
Yes, master.

49:08.487 --> 49:10.239
Just one question...

49:12.366 --> 49:13.909
Yes, master.

49:18.080 --> 49:21.292
What did you do to him?

49:38.309 --> 49:42.813
My third year in the school of the condor,
there were only two disciples.

49:44.565 --> 49:48.819
The other one left because he found it
ridiculous and meaningless.

49:49.612 --> 49:55.075
The jerk said he just let her tease him
because the school was for free.

50:04.793 --> 50:07.338
Tomorrow the season will change.

50:07.713 --> 50:10.382
And this spring will be different.

50:11.008 --> 50:14.595
It will be called
"the season without legs".

50:42.998 --> 50:47.878
We are going to start with
a 30 minute jog.

50:49.213 --> 50:52.466
To get to puma rock,
it will take about 15 minutes.

50:53.217 --> 50:56.345
Run to the top, then come back down.

53:07.393 --> 53:09.687
I thought you only ate vegetables.

53:10.646 --> 53:13.357
Eating fats
will help to maintain your voltage.

53:14.316 --> 53:17.277
The voltage that makes your heart work.

53:17.736 --> 53:22.658
Your cells maintain this voltage
in their membranes, made of fatty acids.

53:22.950 --> 53:28.288
Not only must you maintain this voltage,
you must also detect energy leaks.

53:28.789 --> 53:30.832
For example, an emotion.

53:30.833 --> 53:36.797
Sometimes an emotion affects you so much,
you can't even move your legs.

56:08.949 --> 56:10.951
You have been patient and persistent.

56:12.536 --> 56:15.038
You have shown more passion than anyone.

56:15.789 --> 56:18.083
I want you to inherit this manual.

56:22.296 --> 56:23.713
Thank you, master.

56:23.714 --> 56:25.132
I tricked you

56:26.550 --> 56:28.552
and set you many traps

56:29.261 --> 56:34.349
to change the energy mode of your body,
so you learn new ways of seeing.

56:37.102 --> 56:43.692
Here you will find all the steps
to master the fist of the condor.

56:46.403 --> 56:48.530
It has all the writings

56:49.031 --> 56:50.990
on how to train,

56:50.991 --> 56:54.578
how to feed your body and your spirit.

57:00.125 --> 57:01.668
But listen.

57:02.836 --> 57:04.671
Use great discretion.

57:05.380 --> 57:09.343
The fist of the condor
has power and wields death.

57:10.093 --> 57:12.763
It is only used if it is inevitable.

57:13.722 --> 57:15.933
It's not used to win personal duels.

57:17.601 --> 57:19.686
I promise not to, master.

57:47.839 --> 57:49.758
My photophobia is getting worse.

57:53.845 --> 57:57.933
The condor woman said
I was going to go blind before I was 40.

58:04.606 --> 58:07.150
I wanted to see them for the last time.

58:11.989 --> 58:13.782
I sat for two days.

58:16.076 --> 58:18.078
Watching them from afar.

58:39.141 --> 58:41.810
She didn't know that I had a brother.

58:43.770 --> 58:45.897
Maybe she never had a chance to know.

58:50.360 --> 58:52.446
I stayed there two more days,

58:53.280 --> 58:56.033
thinking of a strategy to kill him,

58:56.950 --> 59:00.454
but in those years I was far
from being a match for him.

59:01.121 --> 59:03.874
Trying could cost me my life.

59:05.167 --> 59:06.668
Ever since that day,

59:07.335 --> 59:09.546
every time I look in the mirror,

59:10.422 --> 59:12.716
I see the face of a coward.

59:27.606 --> 59:30.649
They say that when a condor
begins to feel old,

59:30.650 --> 59:33.278
or loses their lifelong partner,

59:34.237 --> 59:38.575
they will throw themselves on to the rocks
to meet their death.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:22.869
In a fight to the death
there is no time to think.

01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:30.001
In a fight to the death
only your instinct responds.

01:00:32.838 --> 01:00:36.383
That is why you must trust
your inner animal.

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:54.693
My master used to say

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:59.280
there were warriors
with such a powerful animal within

01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:01.575
that they could become a nagual.

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:04.536
What is a nagual?

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:06.079
Follow me.

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:16.501
A warrior is tenacious.

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:22.716
He spends so many years fine-tuning
and perfecting that neat and tidy life,

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:27.012
that he is not going to waste it
in a passing combat.

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:31.474
There is too much at stake.

01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:34.310
There is no room for silly mistakes.

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:36.479
The stake is too high.

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:41.067
That is why each action of the warrior
is like his last battle.

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:47.081
You must be his best student.

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:49.875
Thank you.

01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:51.461
You're very kind.

01:08:52.128 --> 01:08:54.297
But there is a technique
that I am missing.

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:56.674
And you have it.

01:08:58.009 --> 01:09:00.261
You think he sent you to get the book.

01:09:01.262 --> 01:09:03.306
But he just wants to size me up.

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:06.517
You are his Guinea pig.

01:09:28.623 --> 01:09:30.958
I can see that you went too long
without training.

01:09:37.465 --> 01:09:40.176
Six years without fighting, right?

01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:00.530
If you give me the manual,

01:10:01.489 --> 01:10:03.533
I will spare your life.

01:10:07.995 --> 01:10:09.706
Go back to your master.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:12.208
Inherit the book from him.

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:17.171
That is how it should be.

01:10:20.174 --> 01:10:22.176
Do you know what some people say?

01:10:23.594 --> 01:10:25.763
That you two are the same person.

01:10:27.265 --> 01:10:28.766
Half man,

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:31.144
half demon.

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:34.522
But I've seen you both.

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:23.691
Do you know what was the last thing
he said before dying?

01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:31.240
He said,

01:13:32.617 --> 01:13:35.328
"for the honor of a warrior..."

01:13:36.537 --> 01:13:39.498
Grant me one last wish.

01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:42.084
What is it?

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:45.963
I want you to tell him...

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:51.218
I'm not going to tell anything to anybody.

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:00.186
You, old loser.

01:14:06.817 --> 01:14:11.113
The old man couldn't believe
that I didn't Grant him his last wish.

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.417
He did not die in peace.

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:31.759
Talking about ugly deaths,
you had a wife and a daughter, right?

01:14:37.348 --> 01:14:38.933
Poor things...

01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:44.063
To die thinking
her own husband killed her.

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:48.859
And the girl...

01:14:50.277 --> 01:14:54.115
I got goosebumps when my master told me.

01:14:57.535 --> 01:15:01.497
To die thinking
that her own father killed her.

01:15:03.457 --> 01:15:05.459
That is macabre.

01:15:06.711 --> 01:15:12.550
Sometimes an emotion affects you so much,
you can't even move your legs.

01:15:18.806 --> 01:15:20.850
My master was right.

01:15:22.643 --> 01:15:26.355
I only had to say a couple of words
to bring you to your knees.

01:15:29.316 --> 01:15:33.236
The sadness of the warrior
is a voltage blow to the chest

01:15:33.237 --> 01:15:38.450
that comes from the depths of the universe
and spreads throughout the body.

01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:40.995
That voltage is neither good nor bad,

01:15:41.412 --> 01:15:43.664
the ego decides its value.

01:15:43.998 --> 01:15:47.334
A warrior can use that voltage
to his advantage.

01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:39.970
What is a condor doing
so far from the mountain range?

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:47.269
The condor is believed to be the messenger
between men and the divine world.

01:16:47.978 --> 01:16:50.231
They used to deliver the prayers,

01:16:50.648 --> 01:16:53.901
but it brought good and lousy omens.

01:16:58.405 --> 01:17:01.826
The incas would say that the condor,
with their size and strength,

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:06.038
was able to raise the sun
over the mountains.

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:18.801
One day you will have to confront him.

01:17:22.346 --> 01:17:25.224
And by then, you may be blind.

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:30.646
But a warrior learns to walk in the dark.

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:35.067
And only by reaching out
into the deep darkness

01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:37.653
he can see himself.
