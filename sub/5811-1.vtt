00:02.200 --> 00:03.610
<i>Last</i> season, on Arrow...

00:03.760 --> 00:04.761
<i>Was it worth it?</i>

00:05.040 --> 00:07.202
All that pain and misery you brought back
from that island?

00:07.400 --> 00:11.086
The reason I came back was to try and save
the people of this city.

00:11.280 --> 00:13.362
You've got the wrong guy.
Oliver Queen isn't the Arrow.

00:13.600 --> 00:14.840
I am.

00:15.880 --> 00:19.282
Everyone thinks the Arrow is dead,
which means Oliver Queen is innocent.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.727
<i>When I joined the League,
I was conscripted with another man,</i>

00:21.880 --> 00:23.962
<i>Damien Darhk.
Damien continues the League's ways,</i>

00:24.120 --> 00:27.408
<i>but through his own organization
filled with a hive of agents.</i>

00:27.600 --> 00:28.886
John?

00:29.120 --> 00:30.281
Something's wrong.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.601
First, let me assure you
that no harm will come to Lyla.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.885
You didn't just lose my friendship.
You lost my trust. You lost my respect.

00:37.040 --> 00:39.725
It was about making sure
that you and you were safe.

00:39.880 --> 00:42.281
I had to keep the circle
as small as possible.

00:42.640 --> 00:47.965
You opened up my heart
in a way I didn't even know was possible.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.646
<i>I love you.</i>

00:51.120 --> 00:54.283
Can I say something strange? I'm happy.

01:12.760 --> 01:14.444
- Good morning.
- How're you doing?

01:23.520 --> 01:24.521
Hey-

01:27.160 --> 01:28.321
Oh. Okay.

01:30.360 --> 01:31.361
Hot.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.367
- Felicity Smoak.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.680
You have failed this omelet.

01:41.960 --> 01:44.042
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:46.280 --> 01:49.523
You know, it's criminal how easily
cooking comes to you.

01:49.760 --> 01:52.047
Well, I always wanted to
expand my horizons

01:52.200 --> 01:53.531
beyond what I could do on the island,

01:53.680 --> 01:57.480
which was basically,
it was cooked and uncooked.

01:57.720 --> 02:00.121
- How was yourjog?
- It was good.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.806
I'm getting used to running
without chasing after someone.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.567
- Mmm-hmm.
- I'm kind of sweaty.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.484
I know. It's amazing.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.886
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.205
Why'd you get this one removed?

02:13.560 --> 02:15.210
I don't need it anymore.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.687
So, what do you have planned
for the rest of the day?

02:20.240 --> 02:22.208
A videoconference
with the Palmer Tech board,

02:22.360 --> 02:26.809
who still question whether
I'm fit enough to inherit Ray's legacy.

02:27.680 --> 02:30.047
Hey, how'd you like your company back
as an early Christmas gift?

02:30.200 --> 02:32.089
I think you're doing a betterjob
of running it than I would.

02:32.240 --> 02:35.642
- It's flirting with bankruptcy.
- Exactly. It's just flirting.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.410
- Mmm. What?
- I got to go.

02:37.560 --> 02:38.641
Where are you going now?

02:38.840 --> 02:42.208
Uh, I have to get stuff at the
farmers' market for brunch tomorrow.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.051
Right, the Hoffmans are coming over.
I forgot.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.770
I don't think I'm ever gonna get tired
of making plans

02:47.000 --> 02:48.889
that don't involve people shooting at me.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.684
This is so cool!

02:59.280 --> 03:01.931
We're really gonna have to work
on your definition of "cool."

03:03.560 --> 03:04.846
Get me up there!

03:06.520 --> 03:08.284
This is so awesome!

03:10.840 --> 03:11.921
Whoo!

03:16.200 --> 03:17.804
Speedy, behind you.

03:21.240 --> 03:23.447
I thought I told you guys
to call me Red Arrow.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.927
<i>A red arrow
just means you can't make a left turn.</i>

03:26.120 --> 03:27.884
Whatever, I'm inside the hijacked truck.

03:42.440 --> 03:43.965
Canary, you'râ‚¬ UP-

04:03.440 --> 04:05.090
Damn it! They have backup.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.001
Anyone manage to get eyes
on that stolen cargo?

04:42.200 --> 04:44.043
They looked like equipment containers.

04:45.880 --> 04:48.121
Not equipment, weapons.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.810
Among other things, Kord Industries

04:49.960 --> 04:51.689
<i>is one of the largest arms manufacturers
in the world.</i>

04:51.840 --> 04:53.888
They also make
a really awesome cell phone.

04:54.040 --> 04:57.283
- No, but weapons are more likely.
- Much.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.046
These Ghosts, if that's seriously
what we're calling 'em,

05:00.320 --> 05:02.891
are stepping up their attacks, escalating.

05:03.120 --> 05:05.122
People are so scared,
they don't even wanna leave their homes.

05:05.320 --> 05:06.845
Unless it's to pack up
in the middle of the night

05:07.000 --> 05:08.206
and get the hell out of town.

05:08.360 --> 05:10.567
What do you want us to do?
Take our football and go home?

05:10.720 --> 05:13.564
No. We ask for help.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.051
Oliver walked away.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.407
That was before these guys
started taking over our city

05:19.640 --> 05:21.244
and turning it into a war zone.

05:21.400 --> 05:22.561
We're dealing with a crisis.

05:22.840 --> 05:25.207
Which Oliver believed
we could handle, Laurel.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.765
And he was right.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.082
I spoke to Walter Steele last night.
He passed.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.446
Does that surprise you?

05:36.600 --> 05:39.001
In three years, we've had three mayors
and one candidate for mayor

05:39.200 --> 05:40.247
who have all ended up dead.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.841
Anyone with any common sense
is not gonna throw their hat in the ring.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.206
So we just go on as we have?

05:44.400 --> 05:46.528
Running City Hall by committee
instead of electing a mayor?

05:46.720 --> 05:49.007
Maybe we should have you focused
on catching these Ghosts.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.447
That's just what
the media calls them.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.090
Because they disappear like ghosts.

05:53.240 --> 05:54.730
Yeah. I didn't say it wasn't cute.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.761
The truth is
these guys are hard to catch.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.962
They're not your
average everyday criminals.

06:00.120 --> 06:03.044
Average everyday criminals don't have
cyanide capsules in their teeth

06:03.240 --> 06:05.607
so they can off themselves
rather than be interrogated.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.450
I'm doing the best I can here.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.204
We need you to do better.

06:09.360 --> 06:12.284
This city was dying before
more masks showed up to wreak havoc.

06:12.520 --> 06:15.444
Look, we'll get these guys eventually.
And things will turn around.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.644
I mean, look, we've rebranded the city.
We got the new tourism program.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.643
We got the new high-speed rail line
to Central City.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.404
Hopefully, from Central City.

06:22.560 --> 06:26.326
Well, maybe we could have a Flash Day,
just like them.

06:26.560 --> 06:31.441
Bottom line, we need an influx of people,
which means an influx of cash.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.769
No, no, no. Keep your seats.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.082
Excuse me, this is a private meeting.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.926
Oh, excellent, I despise interruptions.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.847
- Who the hell are you?
- Me?

06:47.320 --> 06:49.163
I'm the man you're looking for.

06:49.400 --> 06:53.610
I'm the one who controls the...
What do you people call them? The Ghosts?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.128
So, you're all fretting
about this city dying.

06:58.320 --> 07:02.166
I'm here on behalf of an organization
that wants you to let it die.

07:02.440 --> 07:03.771
See, death is a beautiful thing.

07:03.960 --> 07:07.851
We die, we go into the ground,
our remains grow into flowers.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.083
It's only in the interval after dying
that new things can sprout.

07:11.320 --> 07:15.609
- That's enough. Get the hell out of...
- Cities are like puppies.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.763
You see them writhing in agony
on the streets,

07:17.960 --> 07:20.201
you put them down,
you don't let them suffer.

07:20.360 --> 07:23.284
- I'm getting security.
- Susanna, calm down. Get down.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.209
It's very rude behavior.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.682
None of you seem particularly likable,

07:32.960 --> 07:36.442
but if you do have any friends
or anyone who does love you,

07:36.640 --> 07:38.529
I suggest you say goodbye.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.563
My people will be in touch.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.007
Mmm.

07:48.320 --> 07:52.006
Oh, Oliver, these eggs are heaven!
Don't tell me you made them in the...

07:52.240 --> 07:54.561
In the slow cooker.
The slow cooker you got us, yeah.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.325
<i>I knew it, I knew it.</i>

07:56.520 --> 07:58.170
People are always so hesitant to try them,

07:58.320 --> 08:00.084
but slow cookers
are absolute life changers.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.208
I don't know how
that is not a bumper sticker yet.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.164
I know!

08:04.360 --> 08:05.885
<i>On the topic of life changers,</i>

08:06.080 --> 08:08.845
you guys really need to
get on the school situation here.

08:09.040 --> 08:12.010
We could write you a recommendation letter
for our school's waiting list.

08:13.200 --> 08:16.329
But wouldn't it help to have
kids first? Or, I don't know, a kid?

08:16.480 --> 08:18.562
Oh, it takes years to get on that list.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.326
And I'm sure kids aren't too far
down the line for you two.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.244
Yeah, we haven't talked about it.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.204
Who wants more mimosas?

08:25.840 --> 08:27.842
- I need to see it. Do you have it on you?
- Honey, it's not...

08:28.040 --> 08:29.201
Baby. You have it on you, right?

08:29.400 --> 08:30.845
- Do you have it?
- Yep.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.241
- Oh, it's stunning.
- It's my mother's.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.205
- So, when are you gonna pop the question?
- Tonight.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.124
What are you guys talking about? Whoop!

08:42.440 --> 08:43.520
Whoa.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.044
Dude! Nice reflexes.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.406
Back off, psycho.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.723
Six people have died
from the crank you've been pushing.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.126
Four of them were kids!

09:26.960 --> 09:30.487
You've certainly chosen
an unusual hobby, Mr. Queen.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.165
<i>He said he'd kill us all.</i>

09:32.400 --> 09:33.970
That was a hell of a press conference.

09:34.160 --> 09:38.245
These people needed a strong reminder
that this city doesn't bow to terrorists.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.330
Susanna?

09:41.160 --> 09:43.083
I thought that tasted funny.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.126
- Call 9-1-1!
- What happened?

09:48.640 --> 09:50.449
John, we have a new problem.

09:50.680 --> 09:53.604
City leadership is being targeted.
They just poisoned the District Attorney.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.963
I'm headed to my father. I need you
and Thea on the other two members.

10:05.360 --> 10:09.285
I'm closest to the head of Emergency
Services. Thea, I need you at City Hall.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.360
Are you okay?

10:16.360 --> 10:18.124
Can we get a nurse over here?

10:19.600 --> 10:22.001
Okay, listen,
the District Attorney just collapsed.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.891
Staffers think it might be poison,
but I need toxicology...

10:33.480 --> 10:34.527
<i>Drop it!</i>

10:39.320 --> 10:41.243
All right, all right, all right.

10:42.880 --> 10:44.882
All right, all right, all right.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.570
Just hold on. I'll get you some help.

11:00.920 --> 11:02.160
You, okay?

11:06.000 --> 11:07.923
<i>Captain Lance, you were warned.</i>

11:33.720 --> 11:35.927
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just a flesh wound.

11:36.120 --> 11:38.930
Captain Lance,
the District Attorney was pronounced dead.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.201
And reports are coming in

11:40.360 --> 11:42.362
that the city comptroller and
the head of Emergency Services

11:42.560 --> 11:43.721
have also been killed.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.644
That's pretty much the city's leadership.

11:46.360 --> 11:48.647
Carries on like this,
there won't be a city left to lead.

11:52.640 --> 11:55.564
- So, what's the occasion?
- Do we need an occasion for dinner?

11:55.760 --> 11:57.205
No, ever since you discovered cooking,

11:57.400 --> 12:00.483
our life's been a never-ending episode
of MasterChef.

12:00.640 --> 12:03.291
But this isn't a dinner.
This is a production.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.250
Are we celebrating something?

12:06.440 --> 12:08.408
Sort of depends on how dessert goes.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.881
No. No, no. I'm almost disgustingly full.

12:11.080 --> 12:14.402
<i>You are going to have to try</i> a <i>bite
or two of this souffle'.</i>

12:15.000 --> 12:16.968
Diet saved by the bell.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.289
- Um...
- What's going on?

12:26.080 --> 12:27.491
You have visitors.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.648
We probably should've called first, but...

12:33.840 --> 12:36.446
We really need your help.

12:36.640 --> 12:38.005
<i>The media's been
calling them the Ghosts.</i>

12:38.160 --> 12:40.766
They're like nothing we'd ever seen
before. Well trained. Well-armed.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.001
And committed.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.084
Anytime we get too close to one of them,
they off themselves with cyanide.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.442
- What's their agenda?
- At first, we thought they were thieves

12:47.600 --> 12:49.443
because they were hitting banks
and jewelry stores.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.490
But then we found out that they've
just been building their war chest.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.001
They've now been stealing munitions
and heavy arms.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.123
- And assassinating people.
- Hon.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.648
- Where are the police?
- Overwhelmed.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.889
Well, a group of this size has to be
work out of a central location,

13:05.120 --> 13:06.610
a base of operations.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.524
Which we haven't been able to find.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.167
Digs seems to think we can handle it.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.121
You disagree?

13:13.360 --> 13:16.284
I think we're in over our heads.

13:17.400 --> 13:18.731
We need the Arrow.

13:20.640 --> 13:21.846
Uh...

13:25.560 --> 13:28.962
- The Arrow's dead.
- We're hoping that's not the case.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.567
We're hoping that you can't change
who you are in your bones.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.404
Come help us stop these guys,

13:33.640 --> 13:39.249
and then you can come back here to your
domestic life of tranquility and soufflÃ©s.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.163
You're uncharacteristically quiet.

13:46.400 --> 13:49.006
What should I say?
Our friends need our help.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.725
We should already be in the car.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.844
How'd you find me?

13:56.000 --> 13:59.209
The world's too small for someone
like Oliver Queen to disappear.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.684
Truth be told,
I expected to find you in Starling City.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.689
I don't wanna be near my family.

14:04.840 --> 14:06.604
Because of what you did to Shrieve?

14:07.240 --> 14:09.368
I read his autopsy report.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.080
I knew you had a capacity
for the unfathomable,

14:12.280 --> 14:14.408
but I actually underestimated you.

14:14.560 --> 14:16.369
What do you want, Amanda?

14:16.560 --> 14:18.403
To help you.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.763
You haven't returned home because
you feel you're a monster.

14:23.040 --> 14:25.964
And you're trying to deny it,
channeling your killer instinct

14:26.120 --> 14:27.531
into something productive.

14:27.760 --> 14:31.048
But you can't change who you are
in your bones.

14:31.240 --> 14:32.605
I don't need a therapist.

14:32.760 --> 14:35.240
The hood and eye makeup suggest otherwise.

14:37.240 --> 14:41.450
Stop trying to run
from your inner darkness.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.761
Embrace it.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.605
Let it run its course.

14:46.480 --> 14:50.485
Oftentimes, the only way out is through.

14:54.760 --> 14:55.966
Through what?

15:07.960 --> 15:09.121
A.R.G.U.S. agents.

15:12.120 --> 15:16.011
When you wake up, just remember
that I'm trying to help you.

15:21.160 --> 15:24.687
Here I thought that my days of riding
in the back of limos were long gone.

15:24.920 --> 15:28.811
Oh. One of the perks of being
Palmer Technologies' CEO in absentia.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.171
Now that I'm back,
they might actually expect me to do stuff.

15:32.320 --> 15:34.846
I wouldn't worry.
We're not gonna stay long.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.486
Geez!

15:41.480 --> 15:43.801
It's tough not to look out this window
and wonder.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.011
Wonder what?

15:47.160 --> 15:49.049
What did we really accomplish?

15:51.480 --> 15:52.845
Felicity and I have a lot of catch up on,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.002
so maybe take us through the evidence
the team has gathered.

15:55.160 --> 15:56.889
That's easy. Nothing.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.523
Okay. So, maybe we'll go through
all the encounters

15:59.720 --> 16:00.846
that you've had with the Ghosts,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.162
everywhere they've hid,
and then Felicity can cross...

16:06.400 --> 16:08.528
- John.
- We should've discussed this.

16:08.680 --> 16:11.047
- Thea and I did.
- We need him.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.849
I'm not expecting you to
welcome me back with open arms.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.964
What I did to you is not easily forgiven.

16:19.200 --> 16:22.522
I'm here to help you with your problem,
and then I'm gone.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.091
Oliver, we don't need your help.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.730
And if we did,
we'd probably choose someone

16:26.000 --> 16:27.570
who didn't kidnap my wife
and endanger my child.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.564
And no one is asking you to pretend like
that didn't happen.

16:30.840 --> 16:32.729
But we're in trouble.
This city is in trouble.

16:32.880 --> 16:35.042
Laurel, I don't need you
to remind me of that.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.408
I just can't go into battle
with a man I don't trust.

16:38.720 --> 16:42.247
Understood, but things are a little worse
than you guys thought.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.609
I hacked into Kord Industries' computers
just to see what the Ghosts stole.

16:45.760 --> 16:47.569
Cluster bombs,
sensor-fused and high yield.

16:47.760 --> 16:49.569
Any more powerful
and they'd have to be nuclear.

16:51.560 --> 16:52.891
What do you wanna do, John?

16:53.080 --> 16:55.242
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to save my city.

17:00.760 --> 17:03.764
Weapons need targets.
These had to be stolen for a reason.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.723
Felicity, hack into
Kord Industries databases.

17:05.960 --> 17:08.247
I wanna know everything that there is
to know about these explosives.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.089
Laurel, you wanna start a dialogue
with your father,

17:10.280 --> 17:11.406
make a list of potential targets.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.369
Digg, Thea, hit the streets.
See what we can find.

17:17.440 --> 17:20.762
Oh. Sorry, sorry. Just old habits.

17:20.960 --> 17:23.281
It's probably not a bad idea
to give your father a heads-up.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.121
Copy - John.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.244
Look, I have a wife and a toddler
to get back home to.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.323
Felicity, will you let me know
if you find anything?

17:32.560 --> 17:34.289
Will do. Say hi to Lyla for me.

17:35.600 --> 17:36.965
He'll come around.

17:38.280 --> 17:39.486
I'll go hit the streets.

17:41.280 --> 17:43.760
Well, I have to say that it feels good
to be at a keyboard

17:43.920 --> 17:45.490
for something other than a teleconference.

17:45.640 --> 17:48.484
I need a map with a list
of all the spots the Ghosts have hit,

17:48.720 --> 17:50.290
including where they encountered the team.

17:50.440 --> 17:51.771
And if we get lucky maybe we can...

17:51.960 --> 17:53.450
Triangulate and determine
a point of origin

17:53.600 --> 17:55.443
where the Ghosts
are operating out of, yes.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.761
Yeah.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.487
All right, here's a list
of all their heists and attacks.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.444
- That was fast.
- Yeah.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.967
Yeah, like, um, riding a bike.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.770
First spot they hit
was the Larson Credit Union?

18:06.920 --> 18:08.524
- No, no, no, it was Starling National.
- Really?

18:08.680 --> 18:10.603
- Mmm-hmm.
- How'd you know that?

18:11.840 --> 18:13.649
Same way you knew about Larson.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.649
- Felicity. Wanna play again?
- Mmm?

18:15.840 --> 18:17.080
What game are we playing?

18:17.320 --> 18:19.448
We're playing "the reason that you know
so much about the Ghosts"

18:19.680 --> 18:23.924
"is because you've been helping the team
behind my back" game.

18:26.920 --> 18:29.366
These guys have got cluster bombs now?
You've got to be kidding me.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.331
That's why I'm here, to see
if you're aware of any potential targets.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.648
The only thing I'm aware of is that
I want you to stay as far away

18:34.880 --> 18:37.360
- from this mess as possible.
- Dad, I thought we'd moved past this.

18:37.520 --> 18:40.000
We moved past a lot of things.
And I am glad, really.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.362
But I don't want you mixing it up
with these psychos.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.682
Even after what happened
to city leadership?

18:44.880 --> 18:47.884
I mean, honestly, I thought that
you would be happy to have our help.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.281
Do I look happy?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.411
Dad, the Ghosts were dangerous

18:51.560 --> 18:54.040
before they got their hands
on experimental explosives.

18:54.320 --> 18:56.004
How are you gonna feel
when they take out a city block,

18:56.200 --> 18:57.645
knowing you didn't do anything to stop it?

19:01.640 --> 19:04.246
Have you heard of anything going on
that's a potential target?

19:04.480 --> 19:06.687
Landmarks, Starling General, et cetera.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.360
What about city events?
Any dignitaries coming to town?

19:09.560 --> 19:12.404
A few ball games, concerts.
Not that there's anyone to buy a ticket.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.251
Train station's getting reopened
tomorrow night for the new rail line,

19:15.400 --> 19:18.165
and Starling General's
having a canned food drive.

19:19.040 --> 19:21.486
People don't come to
Star City anymore, Laurel.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.081
They wanna leave.

19:25.160 --> 19:29.927
Who is the cutest?
Who is the cutest ever, ever?

19:30.200 --> 19:32.885
Playing with her like that,
I'm pretty sure it's you.

19:34.240 --> 19:37.210
It's amazing how everything else
can just melt away except for her.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.564
What's melting tonight?

19:41.400 --> 19:43.050
I know it's been a rough few months.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.409
These men you're dealing with.

19:45.600 --> 19:49.082
Tonight, it's just one man.
Oliver's back.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.761
That didn't take long.

19:51.080 --> 19:52.969
You knew he was coming back,
why didn't you warn me?

19:53.520 --> 19:56.285
What's the saying?
"Only the dead have seen the end of war."

19:56.560 --> 19:59.245
- Please, Oliver's not a soldier.
- Isn't he?

20:00.240 --> 20:02.811
That's pretty forgiving, considering
he kidnapped you six months ago.

20:03.080 --> 20:06.641
You know why he did.
You have to let go of it sometime.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.402
- I have.
- It's because you're better than me.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.483
It's one of the reasons why I love you.

20:12.600 --> 20:17.606
It was war, Johnny. Maybe not against
a country, but it was war.

20:18.320 --> 20:20.971
And in times of war,
we do what we have to do.

20:21.240 --> 20:22.401
Really, Lyla?

20:22.960 --> 20:25.930
I mean, that includes lying to me?
Lying to Felicity?

20:27.120 --> 20:28.565
Come on, what's the point?

20:28.800 --> 20:31.451
Oliver did what he thought he had to do
to defeat Ra's.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.768
I'm not saying he made the right choice.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.480
But if Oliver Queen
always made the right choice,

20:36.720 --> 20:38.245
he wouldn't need you.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.402
I used to think
that yelling Oliver was scary.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.841
I'm starting to think that
silent Oliver is a lot worse.

20:46.120 --> 20:47.849
I'm just going over
the past five months in my head.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.128
When you got food poisoning
when we were in Thailand.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.482
Yes. I might've been secretly
working with the team,

20:52.680 --> 20:54.842
but I didn't exactly lie
about the food poisoning.

20:55.080 --> 20:56.650
Laab Moo is extremely hard to digest.

20:56.840 --> 21:00.367
What about when you missed our boat?
"Missed," in Positano.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.929
Okay, that one was a little fib.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.360
Bali?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.002
Felicity, you said there wasn't
even email involved!

21:07.320 --> 21:09.687
I know, but we both know
I'm just that good.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.205
I don't understand.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.647
The whole point of starting over
was to get away from all of this.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.002
And we were both right there together
leading that charge.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.322
I know. And I thought
that's what we needed.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.528
And the first few months
were great, really great.

21:20.800 --> 21:23.371
But then when you and Laura Hoffman
started exchanging cooking tips,

21:23.520 --> 21:25.522
I secretly wanted to gouge out my eyes.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.529
- I thought you were happy.
- I was.

21:27.720 --> 21:32.203
Deliriously happy with you,
but bored with everything else.

21:32.440 --> 21:36.570
Look, I miss this.
I miss saving the city and helping people.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.201
It gives my life purpose.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.727
And I wish I got the same thrill
from choosing between

21:42.960 --> 21:46.681
the dimpled flatware and the scalloped,
but I just don't.

21:46.880 --> 21:50.851
Hey, I don't care that you lied to me.
I don't care.

21:51.080 --> 21:55.847
I care that the entire time
we were supposed to be away, together.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.844
Part of you was still here.

21:58.080 --> 22:02.927
I love every moment that I'm with you,
no matter where we are.

22:04.880 --> 22:05.927
What's that?

22:06.080 --> 22:08.890
I hacked Kord Industries to check out
the design schematics for their bombs.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.570
Turns out they have
a GPS tracker built in.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.762
- Can you find out where it is?
- At least where they've been.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.890
GPS is offline now,
but their last location was...

22:17.560 --> 22:21.167
It's a truck depot outside Pennytown.
Closed up shop months ago.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.402
I'll call Thea. You get Laurel and Dig.

22:23.560 --> 22:26.245
This may be a good time to tell you that
Cisco worked up a little something

22:26.400 --> 22:28.926
before he knew you were leaving.
A new suit.

22:29.080 --> 22:31.128
I'm not staying long enough
for a new suit.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.562
I heard about places like this.

22:38.720 --> 22:41.451
Owners must've left
when the city started tanking.

22:41.720 --> 22:45.202
Well, our new friends
seem to have found a use for it.

22:45.400 --> 22:48.563
Gentlemen, the world's a funny place.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.770
It resists change, it fights progress.

22:52.280 --> 22:56.604
And so the only way to move things forward
is to fight back.

22:57.240 --> 22:59.891
And you men are here today
because you understand that.

23:00.080 --> 23:03.880
But our cause is only as strong
as our weakest man.

23:06.280 --> 23:08.123
Mr. Alvarez, please step forward.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.049
You commanded the hijacking
the other night.

23:13.280 --> 23:15.169
The cluster bombs from Kord Industries.

23:15.440 --> 23:19.445
Yes, sir. We encountered
some resistance, but we handled it.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.967
MR. x; And handled...

23:22.640 --> 23:26.008
Well, I guess my definition of "handled"
is a little different than yours.

23:26.280 --> 23:30.569
You see, when I handle a problem,
the problem dies.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.484
Sir, we got away with the bombs, so...

23:33.080 --> 23:36.129
You know, I love this town in the fall.

23:36.280 --> 23:39.489
I mean, yes, it looks pretty much the same
as it does in the three other seasons,

23:39.680 --> 23:42.286
but I admire consistency.

23:42.520 --> 23:45.171
I respect dependability.

23:47.080 --> 23:51.802
And you've shown me neither.
So, now, allow me to show you something.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.321
It's another kind of beauty.

23:54.520 --> 23:57.808
It's the manipulation
of primordial energies.

23:58.440 --> 24:00.329
No? Over your head? Yeah.

24:00.520 --> 24:04.809
The grazing of the levers
that God uses to move the world.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.371
No? No?

24:09.840 --> 24:10.887
This.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.687
- Oh, my God!
- What the hell is that?

24:20.200 --> 24:21.201
Move!

24:50.240 --> 24:51.526
Hey, Speedy!

24:52.880 --> 24:55.042
SCPD, put your hands in the air!

24:57.840 --> 24:59.922
What are they gonna do
with the explosives?

25:01.200 --> 25:02.565
Tell me!

25:02.720 --> 25:05.087
They're gonna destroy Star City Station.

25:05.360 --> 25:06.600
Hands where I can see them.

25:11.360 --> 25:12.885
We got to go! We got to go!

25:28.600 --> 25:31.126
Oh, I remember that look.
That is not a good look.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.884
We found out
what they have planned at least.

25:33.040 --> 25:35.441
They're gonna use the explosives
on the new train station.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.927
Yeah, pretty sure
I had that one in the office pool.

25:38.640 --> 25:39.766
Too soon?

25:39.920 --> 25:41.570
They're probably planning the attack
for tomorrow night,

25:41.760 --> 25:43.444
to celebrate the reopening
of the new rail line.

25:43.640 --> 25:46.246
Are we not gonna talk about
what just happened?

25:46.440 --> 25:48.602
That dude just killed that guy
by touching him.

25:48.800 --> 25:51.565
Wait. We're dealing with a metahuman?
Like we didn't have enough problems?

25:51.760 --> 25:52.807
He wasn't a metahuman.

25:52.960 --> 25:54.644
Oliver, what that man did was not natural.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.928
I know. it was mystical.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.645
<i>How can you be so sure?</i>

26:00.480 --> 26:01.925
Because I've seen things.

26:02.640 --> 26:06.326
There are things that can't be explained,
even by science.

26:06.600 --> 26:09.126
I suppose you aren't gonna tell us
about these things you've seen, Oliver?

26:09.320 --> 26:11.163
We need to focus
on finding the cluster bombs.

26:11.440 --> 26:12.726
Can you reactivate the GPS?

26:12.960 --> 26:16.248
Yeah, eventually, but I'm pretty sure the
train station's gonna be blown up by then.

26:16.440 --> 26:19.330
Fine. So we do this the old-fashioned way.

26:20.200 --> 26:22.282
So, this is the old fashioned way?

26:22.640 --> 26:24.847
Can we maybe discuss last night?

26:25.600 --> 26:27.648
It's pretty amazing, right?

26:28.160 --> 26:30.162
How could you ever
wanna give up that rush?

26:30.480 --> 26:31.970
Extremely easily.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.450
It's not what I'm talking about.
You seemed a little out of control.

26:36.280 --> 26:40.171
This coming from the guy who used
to use criminals as target practice?

26:40.360 --> 26:43.011
I'm amazed by how far you've come
in five months,

26:43.200 --> 26:46.522
and I'm under no illusions
that this isn't a violent life.

26:46.680 --> 26:51.686
I just want you to remember that
it's restraint separating us and them.

26:52.480 --> 26:58.203
Well, you've managed to be back, what,
24 hours before giving me a lecture.

26:58.440 --> 27:00.283
Think I owe Laurel 50 bucks.

27:00.480 --> 27:01.686
I'm being serious.

27:02.520 --> 27:04.124
How long has this been going on for?

27:04.360 --> 27:08.968
Nothing is going on, okay?
I've just become a better fighter.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.561
A better fighter remains in control
when they fight.

27:13.480 --> 27:14.811
Is everything okay?

27:15.520 --> 27:16.965
It's not okay.

27:17.120 --> 27:20.044
My brother
can't seem to stay out of my business.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.804
All passengers...

27:24.400 --> 27:26.323
- Any luck?
- No.

27:27.800 --> 27:30.406
Does Thea seem a little off to you?

27:30.640 --> 27:34.247
No, she's fine.
Just a little too aggressive, maybe.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.645
But I remember you were same way
when you started out.

27:37.920 --> 27:40.651
I saw that you took my advice
on the identity concealment.

27:40.880 --> 27:42.564
Oliver, man, what are we doing?

27:42.920 --> 27:45.526
Pretending everything's normal?
That we are normal?

27:45.760 --> 27:46.921
I'm looking for a way in.

27:47.160 --> 27:50.323
I was furious to think that you trusted
Malcolm Merlyn more than you trusted me,

27:50.520 --> 27:52.249
but then I realized
that I'm not angry at you.

27:52.440 --> 27:56.240
I'm angry at myself for thinking
you're someone that you clearly aren't.

27:56.520 --> 27:58.170
I don't know what that means.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.601
Oliver, after everything
we've been through, man.

28:00.840 --> 28:03.002
I couldn't fathom why you didn't trust me.

28:03.920 --> 28:07.208
But then I realized you couldn't.
It's not who you are.

28:08.120 --> 28:11.442
You don't trust. You don't love.

28:11.840 --> 28:13.569
You were able to fool Ra's
and join the League

28:13.840 --> 28:16.605
because inside you were
every bit as dark as they are.

28:20.920 --> 28:22.206
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

28:22.440 --> 28:24.966
Responding to a bomb threat's
kind of in the SCPD job description.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.646
You know what I mean.
I'm glad we're working together.

28:27.880 --> 28:30.087
Well, it seems like you're working
with a lot of people these days.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.884
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Excuse me.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.566
- Dad.
- Prodigal Arrow returns.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.723
- Captain Lance.
- I thought that was you last night.

28:37.920 --> 28:39.604
Some mask over your head.
Felt like old times.

28:39.800 --> 28:40.961
Only trying to help.

28:41.240 --> 28:43.129
If that were true,
you wouldn't have come back.

28:43.320 --> 28:45.448
This town started going to crap
the moment you put on that hood.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.130
You brought madness into all our lives,

28:47.320 --> 28:50.449
and the monster you were
inspired monsters.

28:51.560 --> 28:52.641
Maybe.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.484
But I'm not a monster anymore.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.925
Then what are you?

29:11.520 --> 29:12.760
Nice nap?

29:13.760 --> 29:17.606
I wasn't napping, I was drugged.
Where's Waller?

29:17.800 --> 29:20.326
Back in Coast City,
sleeping off the scotch.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.966
Wake her up.
I wanna know what I'm doing here.

29:23.120 --> 29:27.205
Director Waller's asked me to thank you
for agreeing to take on this mission.

29:27.440 --> 29:30.364
Okay, look, I didn't agree to take on...

29:30.520 --> 29:32.522
Sorry, we're on a bit of a clock here.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.046
Now, you're getting out of this plane.

29:34.200 --> 29:37.363
You can do that with a chute on your back
or a bullet in your head. Your call.

29:46.440 --> 29:47.726
Why is Waller doing this?

29:47.880 --> 29:50.724
I guess she likes you. And I didn't think
Waller could like anybody.

29:50.880 --> 29:53.804
- Plus, you know the terrain.
- What terrain?

29:54.000 --> 29:58.483
Your job is to infiltrate the area,
assess the threat and report back.

29:58.680 --> 30:01.809
You have AES-encrypted communication gear
in your pack.

30:04.200 --> 30:08.330
Now, according to our intel,
your target may be radar-capable,

30:08.520 --> 30:10.648
so you'll have to HALO in!

30:10.840 --> 30:16.051
So when you think you're about to splat,
only then do you pull the chute.

30:22.240 --> 30:23.480
Wait. Is that...

30:29.000 --> 30:31.002
Uh-oh. You have mopey face.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.089
Were you worried
after five months of happiness

30:33.320 --> 30:35.163
that you weren't gonna be able to
make it anymore?

30:35.360 --> 30:36.930
I ran into Lance.

30:37.080 --> 30:39.560
And he gave you a hug
because he missed you?

30:39.760 --> 30:42.206
Yeah, well, it's not just Lance.

30:42.720 --> 30:45.610
Thea, there is something wrong with Thea.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.444
She doesn't want my help.
Neither does Diggle.

30:47.680 --> 30:50.365
We should never have come back here.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.770
Let's go. Let's go home.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.764
You don't wanna go home.

30:55.040 --> 30:56.530
I love our new home.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.285
And I love you.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.931
But I also love it here, and you can't
honestly tell me that you don't.

31:03.120 --> 31:06.283
Yeah, no, of course, I miss aspects of it.

31:07.120 --> 31:11.205
The sense of purpose, the idea of
helping people, but Lance was right.

31:11.400 --> 31:12.811
About what?

31:15.360 --> 31:18.364
A few months ago, he told me that
all I brought back from the island

31:18.600 --> 31:19.965
was pain,

31:20.960 --> 31:22.803
misery and darkness.

31:23.040 --> 31:26.328
And of course,
I knew that the moment we came back here

31:26.560 --> 31:28.483
that darkness would be waiting for me.

31:28.720 --> 31:29.960
Well, he's wrong, dead wrong.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.322
You didn't bring the darkness back
with you from Lian Yu.

31:32.560 --> 31:35.086
But, Felicity, I'm telling you
that the only way I know

31:35.240 --> 31:38.005
how to fight the darkness
is to be darkness.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.083
That is why I left.

31:40.560 --> 31:43.086
And I don't wanna be
that type of person anymore.

31:43.280 --> 31:46.568
Then maybe you just need to be
a different kind of person.

31:46.720 --> 31:50.008
And you're not doing this alone anymore.

31:51.320 --> 31:52.924
Train station was a bust.

31:53.080 --> 31:56.323
No incendiaries on the platform,
on the tracks or inside any of the trains.

31:56.480 --> 31:57.845
Yeah, but if there's no bomb
in the station,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.002
then how do they expect to blow it up?

32:01.520 --> 32:03.522
You didn't bring the darkness here.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.807
The bombs aren't at the station
because they're bringing them in.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.287
On a train. When's the reopening ceremony
scheduled for?

32:09.440 --> 32:13.206
9:58. To coincide with the arrival of the
first high-speed train from Central City.

32:13.440 --> 32:15.807
- Let's suit up.
- You should suit up, too.

32:16.600 --> 32:17.647
What?

32:54.720 --> 32:56.165
Get me closer!

32:56.920 --> 32:57.967
I'm trying!

32:58.320 --> 33:01.403
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the first train from Central City</i>

33:01.760 --> 33:03.171
<i>will be arriving shortly.</i>

33:05.000 --> 33:07.571
Everybody, get out of here! It's not safe!

33:14.160 --> 33:15.844
Out of the way!
Out of the way! Out of the way!

33:21.560 --> 33:23.961
- Whoa. You're really strong.
- Go.

33:24.160 --> 33:25.207
Thank you!

33:25.440 --> 33:29.570
<i>This is SCPD. Everyone,
quickly and quietly evacuate the station.</i>

33:33.960 --> 33:36.531
<i>Everyone, move calmly
towards the exit. Calmly!</i>

33:39.160 --> 33:42.528
Train is 10 minutes out.
Six minutes till safest blast radius.

34:03.240 --> 34:04.685
Situation report.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.206
Mr. Slater?

34:09.440 --> 34:13.126
Sorry, he had to get off
at an earlier stop.

34:14.480 --> 34:17.484
You can't be the Arrow. He died.
So who are you?

34:17.639 --> 34:19.051
You're about to find out.

34:21.199 --> 34:23.202
Stop the train.

34:23.400 --> 34:24.844
No, I don't want to.

34:25.440 --> 34:29.603
Even if I did, I couldn't. I destroyed
the braking system 20 miles ago.

34:29.880 --> 34:32.406
Willing to die to destroy a train station?

34:32.600 --> 34:33.931
No. That would be ridiculous.

34:34.080 --> 34:36.081
Then how were you planning on
getting off the train?

34:36.360 --> 34:38.203
Oh, you don't know who I am, do you?

34:40.800 --> 34:42.324
I'm Damien Darhk.

35:06.920 --> 35:08.410
Is that all you got?

35:16.520 --> 35:20.286
It seems you've much in common
with the Arrow. You're both dead.

35:31.520 --> 35:32.806
Thank you.

35:35.880 --> 35:37.450
We need to stop the train.

35:37.600 --> 35:40.126
- You got any ideas?
- Yeah. Blow it up.

35:57.480 --> 35:58.527
Whoa.

36:06.240 --> 36:09.562
So what're you gonna call yourself now?
Everybody thinks Roy was the Arrow.

36:09.760 --> 36:12.445
Well, he won't need a code name
if he's headed back to Ivy Town.

36:17.320 --> 36:19.163
Well, then I guess I need a code name.

36:20.520 --> 36:22.329
Felicity and I, we have missed this.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.171
We've missed all of you.

36:24.960 --> 36:27.167
And this city is far worse off
than we thought.

36:27.320 --> 36:28.481
What are you talking about?

36:28.640 --> 36:30.404
The man leading the Ghosts
is Damien Darhk.

36:30.600 --> 36:33.410
Darhk left Star City months ago.
Why would he come back?

36:33.560 --> 36:36.530
Did Ra's tell you anything about Darhk
that'd give us any idea about his agenda?

36:36.680 --> 36:41.481
He said that Damien Darhk
had a hive of operatives at his disposal.

36:41.720 --> 36:44.405
"Hive." That was the exact word he used?

36:44.680 --> 36:47.763
Yes. Why? Does it mean something to you?

36:49.080 --> 36:50.241
Who would wanna kill Andy?

36:50.440 --> 36:53.171
Don't know their names. Just an alias.

36:54.200 --> 36:55.531
Hive.

36:56.640 --> 36:57.766
No.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.011
- No, nothing.
- You all right?

37:01.160 --> 37:03.162
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, man. I'm just beat.

37:03.880 --> 37:05.723
Plus, I have a little girl to tuck in.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.728
John. John!

37:08.920 --> 37:14.006
Listen, I'm not quite there yet, Oliver,
so let's not do this right now.

37:14.200 --> 37:16.043
No, I know. I get it.

37:16.880 --> 37:18.848
But there is something we do need to do.

37:19.720 --> 37:22.087
- Captain, new problem.
- Seriously?

37:22.280 --> 37:24.282
Someone's hacked into
the Emergency Broadcast System.

37:24.520 --> 37:26.090
They've taken over all the networks.

37:26.280 --> 37:28.408
<i>Six months ago, the Arrow died.</i>

37:29.680 --> 37:31.330
<i>But what he stood for didn't.</i>

37:32.520 --> 37:36.889
It lived on in the heroes
who took up his mantle.

37:37.080 --> 37:42.120
<i>People who believe that this city
should never descend into hopelessness.</i>

37:42.360 --> 37:45.728
<i>Who believe, although life
is full of darkness,</i>

37:45.920 --> 37:48.366
<i>that darkness can be defeated by light.</i>

37:49.320 --> 37:54.451
<i>And tonight, I am declaring my intention
to stand with them.</i>

37:54.640 --> 37:57.211
To fight for this city.

37:58.240 --> 38:02.165
To be the symbol of hope
that the Arrow never was.

38:03.800 --> 38:06.451
I am

38:08.080 --> 38:10.401
the Green Arrow.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.206
Who are you?

38:30.000 --> 38:31.240
Answer me.

39:23.600 --> 39:24.886
You have a visitor.

39:34.120 --> 39:35.565
Sorry about the arm.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.205
A necessary subterfuge

39:37.360 --> 39:40.250
to prevent anyone from suspecting
your involvement with HIVE.

39:40.440 --> 39:41.566
What do you want?

39:41.720 --> 39:45.486
Well, I'm a little disappointed the train
station isn't a smoldering pile of ash.

39:45.640 --> 39:49.884
I'm not. Mass murder? Killing innocents?
I didn't sign up for this.

39:50.040 --> 39:53.169
You signed up to follow my instructions,
to do my will.

39:53.360 --> 39:54.805
I wanna know everything
about this Green Arrow,

39:54.960 --> 39:56.246
where he lives, and who he loves.

39:56.400 --> 39:59.210
And I want him off the boards
by the time my associates arrive.

39:59.720 --> 40:01.449
And if I don't help you?

40:01.640 --> 40:03.085
Well, then I would be surprised.

40:03.280 --> 40:07.171
'Cause I think I made it abundantly clear.
You don't have a choice.

40:12.000 --> 40:16.688
So my guilt over displacing Thea is
only slightly outweighed

40:16.960 --> 40:20.328
by how amazing this place is.

40:22.440 --> 40:25.171
Thea's actually been living with Laurel
for the past few months.

40:25.440 --> 40:28.762
- Oh.
- Ra's stabbed her right over there.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.365
- Oh.
- We can get a rug.

40:31.960 --> 40:36.921
You know, I'd hate to disappoint you.
That speech is pretty hopeful.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.363
Why would that disappoint me?

40:39.600 --> 40:42.046
Well, you know how you said that
you didn't know how to be a hero

40:42.240 --> 40:44.322
without the darkness.

40:44.520 --> 40:48.047
And I know how you hate being wrong.

41:11.040 --> 41:12.849
I'm sorry I missed the funeral.

41:14.400 --> 41:15.686
- Zoom?
- Yeah.

41:15.880 --> 41:18.167
There was a time
I would've thought this was my fault,

41:18.400 --> 41:20.971
that I'd brought this darkness upon us.

41:21.240 --> 41:24.722
But now I know it's not my fault.
It's my responsibility.

41:24.960 --> 41:27.440
Responsibility to do what?

41:27.720 --> 41:28.846
To end it.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.251
I'm gonna kill him.

41:31.400 --> 41:33.164
Is there anything I can do?

41:33.360 --> 41:34.930
I wanna be left alone.

41:35.920 --> 41:37.001
