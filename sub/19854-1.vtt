01:43.203 --> 01:45.838
[high-pitched female]
Okay, then if he's
showing Bakersfield love,

01:45.972 --> 01:48.507
how come he has
a picture of Hawaii?

01:48.641 --> 01:50.275
[laughter]

01:50.410 --> 01:52.377
And just so you know,

01:52.512 --> 01:55.447

the The Bluffs here

01:55.582 --> 02:01.520

02:11.197 --> 02:13.031
You can't hang out
seriously here.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.334
You gotta be careful
'cause the Police
here in Bakersfield ,

02:15.468 --> 02:16.602
they don't mess around .

02:16.736 --> 02:19.037

You gotta make

[screech chuckle]

02:39.392 --> 02:43.195

'cause he told me.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.132

You don't understand .

02:47.267 --> 02:48.400
l damn near pissed myself.

02:48.535 --> 02:51.937
[laughter]

02:52.071 --> 02:54.740
And here

Oh , yeah .

03:02.882 --> 03:06.485
And for everybody

03:06.619 --> 03:09.721
[chuckles]
[imitates banjo]

03:16.129 --> 03:17.362
Yeehaw!

03:19.899 --> 03:22.868
But l still

l still love it.

03:23.002 --> 03:25.470
But yeah , man ,
drinking here in town ,
you gotta be careful

03:25.605 --> 03:27.573
'cause some people
can handle alcohol .

03:27.707 --> 03:29.041
You know who you are.

03:29.175 --> 03:30.876
Some people can't.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.077
And you have no clue.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.581
Guys especially.
You know how it goes.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.250
We get loaded ,
we turn into one
of three people.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.252
We're either
the l love you guy,

03:40.386 --> 03:41.520
l hate you guy,

03:41.654 --> 03:43.822
or the "mere" guy.

03:43.957 --> 03:44.690
You know that guy, right?

03:44.824 --> 03:46.992
Shh , hey!

03:47.126 --> 03:48.026
Mere.

03:55.268 --> 03:58.537
l know 'cause
that's me.

03:58.671 --> 04:00.305
Oh my God ,
l can't handle alcohol .

04:00.440 --> 04:03.008
People, when they get drunk
they say things they
don't mean .

04:03.142 --> 04:04.643
You know when l'm drunk
you hear something like

04:04.777 --> 04:07.713
Woo! l'm going running .

04:07.847 --> 04:09.815
[laughter]

04:09.949 --> 04:12.551
You better
cut me off.

04:12.685 --> 04:14.086
Aw, hell , yeah man .

04:14.220 --> 04:16.154
And when l drink,
l only drink like
regular alcohol .

04:16.289 --> 04:18.156
l don't do beer.
Beer just doesn't--no.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.826
Beer makes me
talk to my body.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.094
l don't like that.

04:22.228 --> 04:23.562
When l get drunk
on beer, l get weird .

04:23.696 --> 04:26.598
l'm , like--
[breathes into mike]

04:26.733 --> 04:30.102
[low growl]

04:30.236 --> 04:31.236
What's the matter?

04:31.371 --> 04:34.206
[laughter]

04:34.340 --> 04:36.074
[low growl]

04:36.209 --> 04:38.944
Hey! You said
you could hang .

04:39.078 --> 04:40.479
[low growl]

04:40.613 --> 04:42.614
Don't talk to me there!

04:42.749 --> 04:45.384
[brrr]

04:45.518 --> 04:47.085
You talkin' shit too?

04:49.889 --> 04:57.663
[audience woos
and cheers]

04:57.797 --> 05:00.465
That's what l say.
You just gotta be
careful , you know.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.769
And if you're gonna drink
and you are thinking
about driving ,

05:03.903 --> 05:07.005
don't do it.
lt's not a good idea
'cause like l say,

05:07.140 --> 05:08.473
You know
when you're drunk.

05:08.608 --> 05:10.342
You're doing laps
in the parking lot

05:10.476 --> 05:12.411
and you can't
find the exit. Hello?

05:12.545 --> 05:14.379
Some of you make
it out to the streets,

05:14.514 --> 05:20.952
you know when you're drunk,
you're like,
[rrr rrr]

05:21.087 --> 05:24.222

05:24.357 --> 05:28.060
[drunken slur]
Shut up, stupid !

05:28.194 --> 05:32.531
lf you hear
the magical sound
[siren]

05:32.665 --> 05:34.700
one of two things
will pop into your head .

05:34.834 --> 05:38.470
Either, one:
[drunken slur]
l'm okay, l'm fine.

05:38.604 --> 05:41.073
l can beat this.

05:41.207 --> 05:42.741
Or, two:
[siren]

05:42.875 --> 05:44.409
[drunken slur]

05:44.544 --> 05:48.246
[laughter]

05:48.381 --> 05:52.584

05:52.719 --> 05:55.954

05:56.089 --> 05:57.756
Tell the kids

05:59.559 --> 06:01.960
[rrr]

06:02.095 --> 06:03.829
l'm gonna tell
you right now, again ,

06:03.963 --> 06:06.064
if you can make
the Police laugh ,
you have a chance.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.999
lf you do get pulled over
for drunk driving ,

06:08.134 --> 06:12.237
pull over as
slowly and as
safely as you can .

06:12.372 --> 06:15.440
Get over to the--
[rrr and screech] .

06:15.575 --> 06:19.478
Now, if you know
for a fact that you
are gonna go to jail ,

06:19.612 --> 06:21.947
okay, you're
already--l'm gone.

06:22.081 --> 06:23.315
Have a little fun .

06:23.449 --> 06:24.716
[laughter]

06:24.851 --> 06:26.685
l don't mean take off
on a high speed pursuit.

06:26.819 --> 06:28.053
No, no, no, don't do that.

06:28.187 --> 06:29.988
'Cause you're not
gonna get very far.

06:30.123 --> 06:33.058
l mean , if you're drunk
and you know you're gonna
go to jail ,

06:33.192 --> 06:35.761
and you have
tinted windows--

06:35.895 --> 06:38.029
have a little extra fun .

06:38.164 --> 06:39.398
Take off your seatbelt,

06:39.532 --> 06:41.199
jump over to
the passenger side,

06:41.334 --> 06:44.503
throw your seatbelt back on
and just wait for the cop.

06:44.637 --> 06:45.637
[laughter]

06:53.112 --> 06:56.681
You have no idea
how bad you're gonna
throw his ass off, you guys.

06:56.816 --> 06:59.918
He's gonna come over
to the driver's side
with a flashlight--

07:07.593 --> 07:10.095
And you're
sitting there. . .

07:10.229 --> 07:14.633
[laughter]

07:14.767 --> 07:16.868
[drunken slur]
He was here
a second ago.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.572
l don't know
where he went.

07:20.706 --> 07:22.274
[laughter]

07:22.408 --> 07:24.609
Excuse me?

07:28.414 --> 07:31.116
[loud laughter]

07:31.250 --> 07:32.617
[cheering and whistling]

07:38.524 --> 07:41.493
That's sad because
l know some of you
are gonna try it.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.094
[laughter]

07:43.229 --> 07:45.130
[childish voice]
Let's do what the fat
guy said ! Do it!

07:45.264 --> 07:47.999
And for the record ,

l'm Fluffy.

07:48.134 --> 07:53.705
[wild cheering]

07:53.840 --> 07:55.674
For those of you
who still don't know,

07:55.808 --> 07:59.344
there are five
levels of fatness.
Fluffy is one of the levels.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.379
There's Big ,
Healthy, Husky, Fluffy,

08:01.514 --> 08:03.081
and
[shouts] Damn !

08:03.216 --> 08:05.484
I'm stiII number four.

08:05.618 --> 08:08.320
People go,
How do you know
when you're number five?

08:08.454 --> 08:10.388
Well , 'cause
people will
tell you .

08:10.523 --> 08:12.157
lf you try to get
on an elevator
that's crowded

08:12.291 --> 08:13.458
and people stop
you and go,

08:13.593 --> 08:15.227
Uh-uh .

08:15.361 --> 08:17.462
Damn !

08:17.597 --> 08:20.665
lf you go to Disneyland
and little kids want
to ride--you !

08:20.800 --> 08:22.033
[laughter]

08:22.168 --> 08:23.802
[childish voice]
l wanna get
on that one.

08:23.936 --> 08:27.038
[deep growl]

08:27.173 --> 08:29.441
[child's voice]
Damn .

08:29.575 --> 08:31.610
Hey, l'm sorry,
little kids are
too honest, man .

08:31.744 --> 08:33.745
They're like
little alcoholics.

08:33.880 --> 08:38.717
l love Disneyland
but they're not
fluffy-friendly.

08:38.851 --> 08:39.918
They're not, man .

08:40.052 --> 08:41.753
They care about safety,
you know,

08:41.888 --> 08:43.822
and that sucks, 'cause
l could handle one bar.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.090
One bar, l'm cool .

08:45.224 --> 08:49.761
But now they got
the whole--[clacking]

08:49.896 --> 08:53.131
lf you're fluffy,
one of those is
not gonna lock.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.767
You're trying--

08:55.902 --> 08:58.570
People are in line,
You can do it!

09:03.342 --> 09:05.343
One time l took a trip
with my buddy Mondo.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.012
A big guy,
another big guy.

09:07.146 --> 09:09.581
And l went with him
because his family,
they decided to go

09:09.715 --> 09:12.517
and he didn't want to be
the only one hanging out
by the strollers.

09:12.652 --> 09:13.885
[laughter]

09:14.020 --> 09:15.420
So we're hanging out
at the end of the day,

09:15.555 --> 09:17.956
my buddy Mondo goes,
Dude, we should
get on a ride!

09:18.090 --> 09:21.226
l go, Which one? We can't
get on none of them , dude,
we're too big .

09:21.360 --> 09:25.463
He goes, there's a ride here
at Disneyland that's called
Splash Mountain .

09:25.598 --> 09:27.265
l go, What is that?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.568
He goes, lt's a log
and you get inside
the log

09:29.702 --> 09:33.505
and it goes uphill ,
it goes down , and
makes a splash .

09:33.639 --> 09:35.540
No seatbelt,
no pull-bar.

09:35.675 --> 09:37.776
You just get in and go.

09:37.910 --> 09:41.846
l go, No seatbelt?
No pull-bar?
[high-pitched laugh]

09:41.981 --> 09:43.381
[laughter]

09:43.516 --> 09:45.483
So we get in line
for our ride, we're
all pumped up,

09:45.618 --> 09:47.752
and l see people
getting off the ride
with these little note cards.

09:47.887 --> 09:49.421
l go, What are those?

09:49.555 --> 09:51.089
He goes, oh , they take
a photo of you when
you go downhill .

09:51.223 --> 09:53.391
Oh , okay, cool .
So we get to the
front of the line,

09:53.526 --> 09:55.994
and then we have to deal
with the lady with
the headset,

09:56.128 --> 09:57.929
the lady who
takes her job
way too serious.

09:58.064 --> 10:00.298
[high-pitched female]
Okay, how many people?
Four? Okay. Two here, two here.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.601
How many, five?
Okay, three there,
two there.

10:02.735 --> 10:04.936
We get to the front,
How many peo--?

10:05.071 --> 10:06.605
[laughter]

10:06.739 --> 10:08.807
Who cares? We
get our own boat.
We take off.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.843
[beeping]
[hissing]
[chugging]

10:11.978 --> 10:13.745
[splashing]

10:13.879 --> 10:16.014
We're splishing and
splashing like
little kids--

10:16.148 --> 10:18.316
[high-pitched laughter]

10:18.451 --> 10:21.686
Three minutes go by,
the moment of truth ,
we get to the hill .

10:21.821 --> 10:27.292
[splash]
[chugging]

10:27.426 --> 10:31.896
[chugging stops]
[hissing]

10:32.031 --> 10:38.637
[laughter]

10:38.771 --> 10:40.639
My buddy Mondo
turns around ,
he says,

10:40.773 --> 10:43.274
Dude, let's
flash the camera.

10:43.409 --> 10:45.610
[loud laughter]

10:45.745 --> 10:48.113
l said , You're stupid .

10:48.247 --> 10:49.347
l'm down .

10:49.482 --> 10:51.149
[loud laughter]

10:51.283 --> 10:52.550
So as soon as
they let us go, right?

10:52.685 --> 10:53.618
[hissing]

10:53.753 --> 10:56.321
[long howl]

10:56.455 --> 10:58.490
[loud laughter]

10:58.624 --> 11:00.925
[howl]
[splash]

11:01.060 --> 11:03.261
We get off the ride,
we are soaking wet,

11:03.396 --> 11:04.329
[screeching laughter]

11:04.463 --> 11:08.333
[squish , squish]

11:08.467 --> 11:11.102
We're all rosado
right here.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.638
We got a mean
old baby rash .

11:13.773 --> 11:18.076
[squish squish]

11:18.210 --> 11:20.278
We go to buy
the picture,

11:20.413 --> 11:22.247
and there's a lady
behind the counter

11:22.381 --> 11:23.848
with her hand
on the screen .

11:23.983 --> 11:25.450
[chuckles]

11:25.584 --> 11:28.119
And l ask my buddy Mondo,
l said , Bro, what boat
are we?

11:28.254 --> 11:32.257
He says, 22 .
l go, She's
covering 22 !

11:32.391 --> 11:33.892
He goes, Oh , we better
sneak out of here.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.627
Ho, yeah , we're
gonna sneak out.

11:35.761 --> 11:38.930
[squish squish]

11:39.065 --> 11:43.068
We get past the picture girl
but then we get stopped
by Disney Security.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.603
And you have not lived
until you been stopped

11:45.738 --> 11:50.909
by a freaking man
wearing a badge in
the shape of a mouse.

11:51.043 --> 11:54.179
This guy was like,
[Southern male accent]
HoId on! HoId on a second!

11:54.313 --> 11:56.481
Ma'am , move away
your hand from
the screen .

11:56.615 --> 11:58.717
You guys see
what l see here?

11:58.851 --> 12:00.485
That's a disgrace
to this park!

12:00.619 --> 12:03.455
We can't believe anyone
could take such a photo.

12:03.589 --> 12:06.291
My question to you guys--

12:06.425 --> 12:09.060
Do you recognize
the two big women
in this picture?

12:09.195 --> 12:10.762
[laughter]

12:19.972 --> 12:22.273
And it wasn't until
we walked over to
this photo

12:22.408 --> 12:25.610
that my buddy
Armando and l realized
something about ourselves.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.680
And that is that when two
full-grown fluffy men

12:28.814 --> 12:32.283
are going downhill
at a 45-degree angle,

12:32.418 --> 12:35.019
with no shirts on ,
going like this,

12:35.154 --> 12:37.088
[laughter]

12:37.223 --> 12:39.891
we both look
like sexy bitches.

12:40.025 --> 12:41.693
[laughter]

12:48.267 --> 12:51.202
But again , if
you're gonna drink,
just be careful, you guys.

12:51.337 --> 12:53.304
Some of you can handle,
and some can't--

12:53.439 --> 12:57.776
l got kicked
out of a bar on
Saint Patrick's Day.

12:57.910 --> 13:01.279
l was performing
at the bar.

13:01.413 --> 13:02.914
How do l get
thrown out, right?

13:03.048 --> 13:04.983
l'm having fun ,
people are giving
me free drinks.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.085
[high-pitched female]
Here, have
another drink.

13:07.219 --> 13:08.386
l'm , like, woo!

13:08.521 --> 13:10.321
l started pissing off
the management

13:10.456 --> 13:12.757
and the owners
of this l rish
place that l was at.

13:12.892 --> 13:15.794
The bartender's like,
Hey, buddy, relax!

13:15.928 --> 13:18.997
Are you okay?
Are you having
a good time?

13:19.131 --> 13:20.999
l was so drunk
l did this:

13:21.133 --> 13:23.635
[imitates l rish accent]
l'm having a great time.

13:28.507 --> 13:31.643
People around me,
Oh my God , are
you l rish?

13:31.777 --> 13:35.680
l was, like,
[imitates l rish accent]
Aye!

13:35.815 --> 13:38.216
They're, like, What
part of l reland
are you from?

13:38.350 --> 13:40.318
Uh , downtown .

13:40.452 --> 13:41.853
Are you here by yourself?

13:41.987 --> 13:45.156
Oh , no, l'm not
here by myself.

13:45.291 --> 13:46.357
Donkey!

13:46.492 --> 13:47.559
[laughter]

13:54.200 --> 13:58.403
Now if you're not laughing ,
you need to get out more often
because that's a funny joke.

13:58.537 --> 14:00.205
That's hysterical .
Ask a 1 0-year old ,
they'll tell you ,

14:00.339 --> 14:02.373
[childish voice]
That's funny!

14:02.508 --> 14:04.843
l did that joke
one night at
Memphis, Tennessee.

14:04.977 --> 14:07.078
And some guy thought
he knew why it was funny.

14:07.213 --> 14:09.280
And he was way off
but he confronted
me outside,

14:09.415 --> 14:13.585
all drunk,
[Southern accent]
Hey, you ! Fluffy!

14:13.719 --> 14:14.986
l'm , like, What?

14:15.120 --> 14:16.821
Mere.

14:16.956 --> 14:19.023
No, you mere.

14:19.158 --> 14:22.794
And he walks over and he says,
l have to tell you your
show was hysterical .

14:22.928 --> 14:26.898
l done near wet myself
when you said 'Donkey!'

14:27.032 --> 14:30.034
My friend Rod didn't laugh
so l had to explain it
to him

14:30.169 --> 14:32.270
and he thinks l'm wrong
but l know l'm right.

14:32.404 --> 14:34.038
Could yah set
the record straight?

14:34.173 --> 14:35.907
Sure, what'd you
tell your friend?

14:36.041 --> 14:38.409
Okay, look here,
l told him the reason
why it was funnier than hell

14:38.544 --> 14:41.112
when you said 'Donkey!'--

14:41.247 --> 14:42.947
it's 'cause you're Mexican .

14:43.082 --> 14:46.951
[laughter]

14:47.086 --> 14:50.421
And you people ride Donkeys!

14:50.556 --> 14:53.858
[laughter]

14:53.993 --> 14:56.461
Normally, l woulda been
all over this guy

14:56.595 --> 15:00.231
but two things,
one, l was in
Memphis, Tennessee,

15:00.366 --> 15:01.566
no support.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.067
[laughter]

15:03.202 --> 15:04.535
And , two,
the guy was drunk.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.804
l just don't deal
with drunk people,
man , uh-uh .

15:06.939 --> 15:08.406
When it comes to
drinking and women ,

15:08.540 --> 15:09.707
ladies, when you go out,

15:09.842 --> 15:11.910
make sure you take
one guy with you .

15:12.044 --> 15:13.278
You need to take one guy,

15:13.412 --> 15:15.046
even if he's--
[high-pitched]
Oh , my God !

15:15.180 --> 15:16.147
You need one.

15:16.282 --> 15:17.348
[laughter]

15:17.483 --> 15:19.150
'Cause a group of you
get together,

15:19.285 --> 15:21.719
there's always one
who will elect herself
the team captain , right?

15:21.854 --> 15:24.822
Try to rally the troops?
Get everybody together--

15:24.957 --> 15:26.457
[high-pitched]
Okay, look,

15:26.592 --> 15:28.860

[laughs]

15:28.994 --> 15:30.628
Okay, look, this

15:30.763 --> 15:32.363
We're gonna take my car,
so leave your car,

15:32.498 --> 15:35.667
my car, leave your car,
ready, ready, let's go.

15:35.801 --> 15:42.273
They get in the car--
[motor noises] .

15:42.408 --> 15:46.744
They get to the club--
[motor noises] .

15:46.879 --> 15:51.015
[clicking heels]

15:51.150 --> 15:52.717
[high-pitched]
Oh no, my purse!

15:52.851 --> 15:55.620
[clicking]

15:55.754 --> 15:58.156
They go inside the club,
they start jamming ,
having fun ,

15:58.290 --> 15:59.290
[club music beat]

16:04.763 --> 16:06.097
(male voice)
Oo-lah !

16:06.231 --> 16:09.767
[club music beat]

16:09.902 --> 16:13.338
End of the night,
that same girl who's
been the leader,

16:13.472 --> 16:16.975
the captain , she gets
more hammered than everybody.

16:17.109 --> 16:19.010
She's the biggest
hypocrite walking ,

16:19.144 --> 16:22.213
now missing a shoe,
purse, keys, friends, car.

16:22.348 --> 16:24.716
Look, some of
you are pointing ,
"That's you , bitch !"

16:24.850 --> 16:26.351
[laughter]

16:26.485 --> 16:28.519
End of the night,
she's stumbling out
of the club,

16:28.654 --> 16:32.957
[high-pitched laughter]
l gotta pee.

16:33.092 --> 16:34.459
Not anymore.

16:34.593 --> 16:37.128
[laughter]

16:37.262 --> 16:40.431
She's on the curb crying ,
mascara's coming down
her face,

16:40.566 --> 16:42.767
[high-pitched]
l'm so wasted .

16:42.901 --> 16:45.570
Who the hell is
gonna want me now?

16:45.704 --> 16:46.804
That's when
l come out.

16:46.939 --> 16:48.573
[shriek]
Wassup?

16:48.707 --> 16:54.912
[laughter]

16:55.047 --> 16:56.447
l keep coming
back to aIcohoI.

16:56.582 --> 16:58.383
l keep having
these issues
with it.

16:58.517 --> 16:59.951
Like, l got

17:00.085 --> 17:01.386
and l don't know
what happened ,

17:01.520 --> 17:03.287
l accidentally wound
up at this, um ,

17:03.422 --> 17:08.358
"dance place"--
gentlemen clubby
place, right?

17:08.493 --> 17:10.294
l wasn't driving ,
it was an accident.

17:10.429 --> 17:13.564
We pulled up to
the place and--
[motor noises] .

17:13.699 --> 17:16.334
[surprised]
Ahhh !

17:16.468 --> 17:17.835
l knew where l was at.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.237
Even when you're drunk,
you could be drunk and blind ,

17:19.371 --> 17:21.039
you know where you're at,
as long as you hear--

17:21.173 --> 17:24.142
[rapid music beat]

17:24.276 --> 17:25.443
[female screech]

17:25.577 --> 17:27.244
[laughter]

17:27.378 --> 17:29.247
I waIked in there
and l got recognized

17:29.381 --> 17:30.615
by one of the dancers.

17:30.749 --> 17:32.483
You gotta
call them dancers
or entertainers

17:32.618 --> 17:34.152
or they get mad at you .
They'll get mad .

17:34.286 --> 17:36.521
[high-pitched]
l am not a stripper.
Okay?

17:36.655 --> 17:39.390

17:39.525 --> 17:42.727
l'm like, Nooo,
I'm an entertainer.

17:42.861 --> 17:45.263
You're a nasty.

17:48.967 --> 17:51.069

and she stops.
Just ee!

18:00.379 --> 18:01.579

21:11.703 --> 21:12.937
That's where l
let 'em have it.

21:13.071 --> 21:15.273
[high-pitched]
Oh , my God , yes!
[laughs]

21:22.648 --> 21:24.282
Hell , yeah , man .

21:24.416 --> 21:25.816
Oh , by the way,
before l forget,

21:25.951 --> 21:27.251
l know l have a
habit on my shows

21:27.386 --> 21:29.420
of sometimes throwing
a little Spanish in there.

21:29.554 --> 21:32.323
lf you
don't understand Spanish ,
l do apologize, okay?

21:32.457 --> 21:34.825
l promise l will
be translating .

21:34.960 --> 21:36.627
l don't want
anybody freaking out

21:36.762 --> 21:39.797
or reporting me to
the management with
concerns or issues, you know.

21:39.931 --> 21:42.700
[male Southern accent]
What the hell is
going on in there!

21:42.834 --> 21:44.435
What kind of
show is this?

21:44.569 --> 21:46.504
Now somebody better
hit the SAP button

21:46.638 --> 21:48.939
on that son of
a bitch real quick!

21:49.074 --> 21:52.243
l didn't pay good money
to hear some Samoan
speak Spanish .

21:58.050 --> 22:01.052
l'm not Samoan ,
l'm--Fluffy.

22:01.186 --> 22:05.423
l didn't know why
the guy thought l
was Samoan , you know.

22:05.557 --> 22:09.193
And l've had this happen
a couple times where people
go, Are you Hawaiian?

22:09.328 --> 22:11.962
Why, no.
lt's not
just the shirt.

22:12.097 --> 22:14.832
l thought it was just the
shirt but no, how can
it just be a shirt?

22:14.966 --> 22:18.836
Just because you wear
a freakin' sombrero, that
doesn't make you Mexican .

22:18.970 --> 22:20.738
l see white people
wearing a sarape,

22:20.872 --> 22:22.540
walking a donkey
with a sombrero,

22:22.674 --> 22:24.709
you don't look at 'em
and go, Hola, amigo.

22:24.843 --> 22:28.746
No, you're like,
Hey, Ted . Hi .

22:28.880 --> 22:31.215
You know, and he's
walking around
Hola. Come on .

22:31.350 --> 22:37.188
Come on , stupid
donkey. Donkey!
Come on .

22:37.322 --> 22:40.524
l don't get it, man .
But it's funny though .

22:40.659 --> 22:42.960
l didn't know why
the guy thought
l was Hawaiian

22:43.095 --> 22:45.196
until l actually
went to Hawaii ,

22:45.330 --> 22:49.834
l found out that Hawaiian
people actually look like
swollen Mexicans.

22:49.968 --> 22:51.502
[laughter]

22:51.636 --> 22:53.904
They do! l got off
the plane, l looked
around , l was, like,

22:54.039 --> 22:57.274
[high-pitched]
Oh , my God !
My family!

22:57.409 --> 23:01.512
Even they were,
like, Aloha brother,
[unintelligible] .

23:01.646 --> 23:02.813
Orale!

23:09.554 --> 23:11.956
l loved Hawaii .
Hawaii was great, man .

23:12.090 --> 23:14.258
They have a lot of
different cultures there.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.260
They have a lot
of Asian people.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.795
A lot. A lot of Koreans.

23:17.929 --> 23:20.498
l know this because l got
a couple of shirts tailored

23:20.632 --> 23:22.066
at some places,

23:22.200 --> 23:24.368
and every time l go in ,
there's always a
Korean lady.

23:24.503 --> 23:28.072
An older Korean lady.
Who was mean .

23:28.206 --> 23:31.075
l'd walk in and this one lady
always had a comment to make.

23:31.209 --> 23:32.410
l'm there for a week

23:32.544 --> 23:34.311
and every day she
had a different comment.

23:34.446 --> 23:36.781
l walk in one day and ,
l couldn't say
anything either

23:36.915 --> 23:38.249
'cause she was
75 years old .

23:38.383 --> 23:40.084
l can't say
nothing back.

23:40.218 --> 23:41.419
But there l am ,
walking in .

23:41.553 --> 23:42.520
[ding-dong]

23:42.654 --> 23:43.888
The lady behind
the counter,

23:44.022 --> 23:45.890
[imitates female
Asian accent]
Ohhh !

23:46.024 --> 23:47.992
Oh , looka who's here.

23:48.126 --> 23:49.059
[laughter]

23:49.194 --> 23:51.295
Looka who's here.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.298
Ohhh , shit,
we gonna worka
hard today.

23:54.433 --> 23:58.569
[laughter]

23:58.703 --> 24:01.005
[unintelligible]

24:04.042 --> 24:05.509
Whatever.
[chuckles]

24:05.644 --> 24:07.545
Don't make
fun of me.

24:07.679 --> 24:09.380
But l can handle it,
you know.

24:09.514 --> 24:10.948
l can handle it.
People say,

24:11.082 --> 24:13.317
Gabriel , you
go up there and
you make fun of yourself.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.085
No, l don't.

24:15.220 --> 24:18.722
l come up here and l
tell you the things
that l heard people say.

24:18.857 --> 24:20.357
There's a difference.

24:20.492 --> 24:24.094
Sometimes l set myself up
for jokes and l don't
realize it.

24:24.229 --> 24:26.397
Three years ago,
l bought a Beetle.

24:26.531 --> 24:27.765
Not even thinking .

24:27.899 --> 24:29.066
[light laughter]

24:29.201 --> 24:30.935
That's not the joke,
shut up.

24:31.069 --> 24:33.370
[loud laughter]

24:33.505 --> 24:35.105
See, l can't even
tell you guys a story.

24:35.240 --> 24:36.974
[high-pitched laughter]
Hmm .

24:37.108 --> 24:38.609
l wasn't thinking ,
l bought the car

24:38.743 --> 24:41.512
'cause it was affordable,
economical , brand new

24:41.646 --> 24:43.347
freakin' Beetle for,
like, 1 7 grand .

24:43.482 --> 24:45.583
l was, like,
[high-pitched screech]
first new car.

24:45.717 --> 24:48.052
l go to show it off
at my friend Martin's house.

24:48.186 --> 24:53.023
l thought it was nice,
l pull up, you know,
[rrr, screech]

24:53.158 --> 24:56.026
Martiiin !

24:56.161 --> 24:59.363
He lives in the Hood ,
l don't get out of
the car.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.999
Across the street
there are these gang members,

25:02.133 --> 25:05.436
they don't really get into
shooting people and stuff
like that,

25:05.570 --> 25:07.738
they just hang out
on the porch and
talk a lot of smack.

25:07.873 --> 25:10.441
So l'm there in the Beetle
and across the street
l hear this,

25:10.575 --> 25:11.809
l'm , like, Martiiin !

25:11.943 --> 25:13.110
And over here, l hear--

25:13.245 --> 25:14.745
Orale.

25:14.880 --> 25:19.149
[laughter]

25:19.284 --> 25:21.619
Hey, what's up, guys?
How's it going?

25:21.753 --> 25:24.622
(more distant voice)
How'd you get in there ese.

25:24.756 --> 25:25.756
[laughter]

25:31.196 --> 25:32.563
Hurry up, Martin !

25:32.697 --> 25:33.898
[laughter]

25:34.032 --> 25:36.734
Two months later,
l go back to pick him up.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.903
Now l've had some time
to work on the car,

25:39.037 --> 25:41.205
l put some rims on it,
some stickers,

25:41.339 --> 25:43.474
l put a chip in the motor
so it goes faster.

25:43.608 --> 25:45.409
l thought l was bad , right?
l pull up,

25:45.544 --> 25:47.778
[rrr, tires screech]

25:47.913 --> 25:50.147
[rrr, rrr]

25:50.282 --> 25:52.950
Martiiin !

25:53.084 --> 25:54.752
Orale!

25:54.886 --> 25:55.953
[laughter]

25:56.087 --> 25:58.289
Uh-uh , l'm not
turning around .

25:58.423 --> 25:59.523
Hey.

25:59.658 --> 26:00.824
Uh-uh .

26:00.959 --> 26:01.892
Hey.

26:02.027 --> 26:03.527
l don't see you .

26:03.662 --> 26:05.629
Yoo-hoo!

26:05.764 --> 26:06.697
[grrr]

26:06.831 --> 26:07.765
Hey!

26:07.899 --> 26:09.266
[grrr]
What! !

26:09.401 --> 26:12.436
Check it out, hey,
it's the fat and
the furious.

26:12.571 --> 26:13.804
[laughter]

26:21.513 --> 26:25.516
l didn't even
wait, man .
[rrrrrr]

26:25.650 --> 26:27.785
l got rid of
that car, man .

26:27.919 --> 26:31.589
l traded it in and got
myself a big old SUV.

26:31.723 --> 26:33.390
lt was nice for a while.

26:33.525 --> 26:37.595
This car freakin' sucked
on mileage. l got 1 1 miles
to the gallon .

26:37.729 --> 26:39.396
Oh , you cannot
be bad-ass in a car

26:39.531 --> 26:41.732
that kills gas
like l kill tacos,
you can't.

26:41.866 --> 26:43.500
[laughter]

26:43.635 --> 26:45.869
You can't be at the
stoplight trying to
intimidate other cars,

26:46.004 --> 26:47.137
What? What, what, what?

26:47.272 --> 26:49.573
[rrrrrrrrr]

26:49.708 --> 26:51.141
Twenty bucks right there.

26:53.478 --> 26:55.079
Hell , no.
But it was
kind of cool .

26:55.213 --> 26:57.715
lt had a G PS
navigational system in it.

26:57.849 --> 26:59.683
An OnStar which
is really cool .

26:59.818 --> 27:02.653
l'm driving , and all
of a sudden this girl's
talking to me,

27:02.787 --> 27:04.855
[ping]
(pleasant female voice)
Right turn , up ahead .

27:04.990 --> 27:06.991
Whoa.

27:07.125 --> 27:10.361
[ping]
At three quarter tenth
of a mile, left turn .

27:10.495 --> 27:12.496
And l'm , like,
Whatever you say, baby.

27:14.432 --> 27:17.534
Being a big guy,
l've noticed that
people feel compelled

27:17.669 --> 27:19.637
to tell me certain
things after shows.

27:19.771 --> 27:23.440
l get people that'll pull
me aside and go, Gabriel ,
you're a very funny guy,

27:23.575 --> 27:26.110
you're very talented ,
don't you think, perhaps,

27:26.244 --> 27:28.912
you're living a
little excess in life?

27:29.047 --> 27:31.315
And l'm like,
Well , l love to eat.

27:31.449 --> 27:33.117
Well , don't you want
to live to be a hundred?

27:33.251 --> 27:36.286
Well , not if
l can't eat tacos.

27:36.421 --> 27:38.555
Or as many
as l want.

27:38.690 --> 27:42.059
A lot of people think
that just because you
work out and lift weights,

27:42.193 --> 27:44.795
and you eat right
and you do what people
tell you to do,

27:44.929 --> 27:47.264
that you'll
live a long life.
Maybe you will ,

27:47.399 --> 27:50.167
but, you know,
why do people measure
life by the years

27:50.301 --> 27:52.069
instead of how good
the years were?

27:52.203 --> 27:54.571
l'll measure by freakin'--
you know what l mean?

27:54.706 --> 27:58.776
[cheering , whistling]

27:58.910 --> 28:00.377
What good is it
to live to be a hundred

28:00.512 --> 28:01.745
but you didn't
do anything?

28:01.880 --> 28:02.980
You didn't go out
and kick it
with friends,

28:03.114 --> 28:04.314
go out and get drunk
at some club

28:04.449 --> 28:05.783
and wake
up in an alley
at one time?

28:05.917 --> 28:07.451
You know?

28:07.585 --> 28:10.354
What good is it?
You stayed in the house
and you were safe.

28:10.488 --> 28:12.089
And l lived
to be a hundred .

28:12.223 --> 28:13.657
You know,
l don't know.

28:13.792 --> 28:16.627
That's why, l , um ,
l have a very big
amount of respect

28:16.761 --> 28:18.996
for the crocodile hunter,
rest in peace, but,

28:19.130 --> 28:24.334
come on , you guys,
yeah , he died at
44 years old , but,

28:24.469 --> 28:27.237
he died doing
what he loves to do.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.940
Not a lot of people
can say that.

28:30.075 --> 28:32.342
lf l die tomorrow
from overeating ,
hoo-hoo,

28:32.477 --> 28:35.312
God bless me,
that's exactly how
it was supposed to be.

28:35.447 --> 28:37.781
[cheering]

28:37.916 --> 28:39.683
You know how much
adrenaline he had?

28:39.818 --> 28:41.552
Every single day,
risking his life,

28:41.686 --> 28:44.088
you know how you
feel when you're about
to cross the street

28:44.222 --> 28:45.889
and a car--
[rrrrrr]

28:46.024 --> 28:47.491
and your ass
almost gets hit,

28:47.625 --> 28:51.662
and you're like--
[screech]
Oh ! Oh ! Oh !

28:51.796 --> 28:55.199
Oh ! and then
you're hysterical .
[high-pitched laughter]

28:55.333 --> 28:57.668
Oh , my God !
l almost died .
[laughs]

28:57.802 --> 29:00.771
Touch me.
Touch me right here.
Oh , my--

29:00.905 --> 29:03.140
And the rest of the day,
you appreciate life,

29:03.274 --> 29:05.676
looking at the birds
or the sky,

29:05.810 --> 29:08.078
[sings]
You're loving life.

29:08.213 --> 29:10.114
He did that
every day.

29:10.248 --> 29:11.815
That's why every day
l try to live

29:11.950 --> 29:14.885
just a little bit of my
life like l might not
be here tomorrow.

29:15.019 --> 29:17.454
'Cause you never know.
l don't wanna die tomorrow

29:17.589 --> 29:19.890
knowing l
coulda had a piece
of cake tonight.

29:25.196 --> 29:26.830
Sure. That's why
people tell me

29:26.965 --> 29:29.066
Why don't you work out?
Why don't you lift weights?

29:29.200 --> 29:30.467
What if l'm
gonna die tomorrow?

29:30.602 --> 29:33.570
l don't want
to die sore.

29:33.705 --> 29:35.272
l wanna die full .

29:35.406 --> 29:36.774
When the coroner cuts me up,

29:36.908 --> 29:39.543
l want the whole room to
smell like potato wedges.

29:39.677 --> 29:41.245
[laughter]

29:41.379 --> 29:44.448
And he's gonna go,
This guy knew how
to live, right here, man .

29:44.582 --> 29:46.750
Good times.
But again , the
crocodile hunter,

29:46.885 --> 29:49.419
l give him a lot of
love, a lot of credit
but people go,

29:49.554 --> 29:52.689
[high-pitched]
lt's such a loss to
the nature community,

29:52.824 --> 29:56.527
you know, he taught
us so much about nature.

29:56.661 --> 29:58.529
And l got
mad when l heard
this lady on TV

29:58.663 --> 30:00.397
saying that
he taught us a
lot about nature

30:00.532 --> 30:03.267
and it was, like,
No, he didn't really
teach a lot about nature,

30:03.401 --> 30:07.304
if you want
to learn about nature,
you watch Discovery channel

30:07.438 --> 30:10.307
or one of these nature
programs where they have
a guy on safari

30:10.441 --> 30:11.675
and he's studying from afar.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.911
Crocodile hunter, no.
Come on , every episode,

30:14.045 --> 30:16.146
[imitates Steve l rwin]
Hey, how you doin'?

30:16.281 --> 30:18.549
Look over there,
right there.

30:18.683 --> 30:20.818
lt's a "toiger."

30:20.952 --> 30:25.255
That toiger weighs 800 pounds
and it could kill a man
in 1 0 seconds.

30:25.390 --> 30:26.323
l'm gonna touch it.

30:26.457 --> 30:27.491
[laughter]

30:34.566 --> 30:35.499
Hi , tiger.

30:35.633 --> 30:36.567
[grrr]

30:36.701 --> 30:40.037
Ow, he's angry!
He's angry.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.506
Next episode,
There's a king cobra,

30:42.640 --> 30:44.775
the most venomous
snake in all the planet.

30:44.909 --> 30:47.578
One "boite"
and l'm dead .

30:47.712 --> 30:48.745
l'm gonna pick it up.

30:48.880 --> 30:49.880
[laughter]

30:50.014 --> 30:50.948
[hissing]

30:51.082 --> 30:53.617
He's angry!

30:53.751 --> 30:56.520
lf he really wanted
people to think he
was out there, man ,

30:56.654 --> 30:59.156
America, we should've
borrowed him ,

30:59.290 --> 31:01.625
and sent him to l raq .

31:01.759 --> 31:04.494
With no gun ,
just a camera crew.

31:04.629 --> 31:07.431
Do you imagine
how bad that woulda
freaked out the enemy?

31:07.565 --> 31:10.300
You're a freakin' soldier
working for Al-Qaeda and
you're out there, you know,

31:10.435 --> 31:16.073
[imitates l raq
accent, unintelligible]

31:16.207 --> 31:18.709
And he's
walking toward him
wearing shorts,

31:18.843 --> 31:19.977
[laughter]

31:20.111 --> 31:21.078
[imitates l raqi
accent, unintelligible]

31:21.212 --> 31:22.679
Crikey!

31:22.814 --> 31:24.982
[l raqi accent]
What is crikey?
What the hell is crikey?

31:25.116 --> 31:28.719
And he's walking
up to him , Hey!
Look over there,

31:28.853 --> 31:31.421
lt's an Al-Qaeda member.

31:31.556 --> 31:32.990
An l raqi soldier,

31:33.124 --> 31:35.792
one of the most
dangerous creatures
in all the planet.

31:35.927 --> 31:39.296
One push of a button
and l'm gone!

31:39.430 --> 31:41.565
l'm gonna poke
him with a stick.

31:52.543 --> 31:53.176
[scream]

31:53.311 --> 31:54.811
He's angry!

31:54.946 --> 31:56.246
[laughter]

31:56.381 --> 31:58.882
l think he's
still angry.

31:59.017 --> 32:03.687
Yeah , man , this country,
l love living here in
the United States.

32:03.821 --> 32:05.989
l can't think of anywhere
else l'd want to live.

32:06.124 --> 32:08.058
Some people say,
Well , you're Mexican .

32:08.192 --> 32:10.193
Wouldn't you rather
live in Mexico?

32:10.328 --> 32:11.528
[whistles, shouts]

32:11.663 --> 32:13.230
Uh--[laughs] .

32:13.364 --> 32:18.101
l love Mexico,
just visiting ,
just visiting .

32:18.236 --> 32:19.870
l like it
right here.

32:20.004 --> 32:21.905
That's why it
kind of bothers me
whenever people go,

32:22.040 --> 32:24.074
(female voice)
What is it like
being a Latino comedian?

32:24.208 --> 32:28.178
l go, l don't know, l'm
a comedian who happens
to be Latino.

32:28.313 --> 32:30.280
(female voice)
What's the difference?

32:30.415 --> 32:34.985
The difference is
my special will air on
Comedy Central , not Telemundo.

32:35.119 --> 32:36.253
[cheering]

32:42.727 --> 32:44.695
lt's hard , you
guys, you know.

32:44.829 --> 32:47.064
Lo español .

32:47.198 --> 32:48.999
You speak a little Spanish ,
it freaks people out.

32:49.133 --> 32:51.301
(female)
Oh my God ,
he's speaking Spanish .

32:51.436 --> 32:54.638
Don't get me wrong ,
l like watching Spanish
programming myself.

32:54.772 --> 32:56.139
Some of the stuff
is really cool .

32:56.274 --> 32:58.141
My favorite thing
are the commercials

32:58.276 --> 32:59.943
because they're
always about sex.

33:00.078 --> 33:01.745
You don't even know
what the product is

33:01.879 --> 33:03.280
until like the
last two seconds.

33:03.414 --> 33:05.649
lt's always some model
walking out all sexy,

33:05.783 --> 33:07.651
[rhythmic music beat]

33:11.022 --> 33:12.489
[sexy female voice]
Hola.

33:12.623 --> 33:15.592
[rhythmic music beat]

33:15.727 --> 33:18.562
[sucks in air]
Ay, què rico.

33:18.696 --> 33:19.696
[laughter]

33:19.831 --> 33:21.665
And on the 28th second ,

33:21.799 --> 33:24.034
[shout and short gasp]

33:24.168 --> 33:25.702
Pepsi .

33:31.976 --> 33:34.945
And you're sitting there,
going , l gotta go
get a Pepsi .

33:35.079 --> 33:39.182
Oh ho yeah !
[laughs]
Oh my God !

33:39.317 --> 33:41.985
l have a thing for soda,
l love it, man .

33:42.120 --> 33:43.353
l know they gave
me water but--

33:43.488 --> 33:45.555
(female voice)
Oh , a soda!

33:45.690 --> 33:47.524
l didn't even see
that right there.

33:47.658 --> 33:49.559
Excuse me,
un momento.

33:49.694 --> 33:50.560
[laughter]

33:50.695 --> 33:51.628
Pepsi .

33:51.763 --> 33:54.264
[laughter]

33:54.399 --> 33:57.968
No, that's
actually diet,
which is cool .

33:58.102 --> 34:00.037
l'm not on a diet,
and it's funny
because people go,

34:00.171 --> 34:01.772
Why then do you
drink diet soda?

34:01.906 --> 34:06.643
So l can eat
regular cake.

34:06.778 --> 34:09.146
l love cake, man ,
are you kidding?

34:09.280 --> 34:13.050
By the way, l wanna thank
the three people who brought
me a cake personally.

34:13.184 --> 34:14.818
l have them in the back.
l really appreciate it.

34:14.952 --> 34:16.520
That was very nice of you .

34:16.654 --> 34:18.621
The management
and the promoters are
freaking out there, like,

34:18.755 --> 34:21.658
Gabriel , why do they
all bring you cake?

34:21.793 --> 34:25.362
l go, Because on TV
l talked about one time
how much l love cake.

34:25.496 --> 34:26.830
And so people bring it.

34:26.964 --> 34:28.431
My friend
Mondo got mad ,
He's, like,

34:28.565 --> 34:33.335
[Mexican male accent]
Why don't you talk
about hookers?

34:33.471 --> 34:35.572
Somebody asked
me earlier too,
they said , Gabriel ,

34:35.706 --> 34:38.375
when you get to do your
special , are you gonna do
anything about the country,

34:38.509 --> 34:40.143
are you gonna talk
about politics?

34:40.277 --> 34:42.179
Well , l'm gonna talk
first of all about how
l love this country,

34:42.313 --> 34:44.147
and l wouldn't want
to live anywhere else.

34:44.282 --> 34:47.050
l know that half the
world right now thinks
that our leader is the devil

34:47.185 --> 34:48.552
and most of us would agree.

34:48.686 --> 34:49.619
[laughter]

34:49.754 --> 34:52.389
He's not--yeah .

34:52.523 --> 34:54.724
l don't have to make
fun of the president.

34:54.859 --> 34:56.193
He does it by himself.

34:56.327 --> 34:57.394
Okay?

34:57.528 --> 34:58.662
[whistling , clapping]

34:58.796 --> 35:01.832
He does it by himself.

35:01.966 --> 35:05.569
Every time he comes
on TV, l can't wait
to hear what he has to say.

35:05.703 --> 35:07.671
Especially during
press conferences,

35:07.805 --> 35:10.340
(high-pitched female voice)
M r. President. Question .

35:10.475 --> 35:14.878
lt's been over a year.
What is your plan
for Katrina?

35:15.012 --> 35:17.514
[imitates Bush's voice]
Ha! We're gonna find her.

35:17.648 --> 35:18.849
[laughter]

35:18.983 --> 35:20.150
That's right.

35:20.284 --> 35:22.586
And we're gonna bring
Katrina to justice.

35:22.720 --> 35:27.557
We have every reason
to believe Katrina
is connected to Al-Qaeda.

35:27.692 --> 35:31.528
Qaeda, Katrina,
they both start
with a "k."

35:31.662 --> 35:34.698
Our president got elected .
I didn'.t vote for him ,

35:34.832 --> 35:37.134
but then again ,
l didn't vote for
the other guy either.

35:37.268 --> 35:38.668
l was just, like--.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.337
How Bush won
is beyond me.

35:40.471 --> 35:43.607
Americans, we love to
vote but we don't vote
for Presidents.

35:43.741 --> 35:47.911
We vote for things like
American IdoI.

35:48.045 --> 35:50.747
Because that's fun.
Voting for presidents
is not fun.

35:50.882 --> 35:55.051
Voting for American--
Shebang ! Shebang !

35:55.186 --> 35:57.420
That's what
they should do
for presidents.

35:57.555 --> 35:59.489
Just put both guys
on TV for one hour,

35:59.624 --> 36:04.027
call it something catchy
like "Who's Gonna Run
This Bitch?"

36:04.162 --> 36:07.164
You put 'em on TV for an hour,
let 'em argue 30 minutes
into the special ,

36:07.298 --> 36:10.534
you put an 800 number
on the screen , and
say "Cast Your Vote."

36:10.668 --> 36:14.671
[phone rings, click]
You've reached the
presidential hotline.

36:14.805 --> 36:16.573
For George Bush ,
press three.

36:16.707 --> 36:18.275
John Kerry,
press four.

36:18.409 --> 36:20.010
Other options,
press five.

36:20.144 --> 36:22.012
You don't like
either one?
Press five.

36:22.146 --> 36:23.680
[beep]
Please hold .

36:23.814 --> 36:26.416
[high-pitched voice
hums U .S . national anthem]

36:32.456 --> 36:33.890
[rings and clicks]

36:34.025 --> 36:36.860
[imitates Clinton]
[chuckles] l knew
you'd be back.

36:44.001 --> 36:47.070
That's right. You know
you miss your daddy.

36:52.710 --> 36:56.546
Oh , yeah .
l'm such a dork.
l don't care.

36:56.681 --> 36:57.914
But l have fun though .

36:58.049 --> 37:00.050
One thing you
guys definitely
made possible

37:00.184 --> 37:02.986
is l have the ability
now to travel and l
never did that.

37:03.120 --> 37:05.155
l never used to travel
until l became a comedian .

37:05.289 --> 37:07.691
l'm , like, Oh my God , there's
a whole other world out there.

37:07.825 --> 37:09.626
When l was hanging
out in Florida,

37:09.760 --> 37:12.963
l got a chance to experience
an amusement park that was
a little different.

37:13.097 --> 37:17.100
lt was an alternative park
called Gatorland .

37:17.235 --> 37:19.169
lt's a real park,
and l've met
the owners

37:19.303 --> 37:21.504
and they're really
cool people but l
gotta tell you :

37:21.639 --> 37:23.240
best part about
this amusement park

37:23.374 --> 37:26.309
is they have a recording
the funniest thing l've
ever heard .

37:26.444 --> 37:28.011
You call this park,
this is what you hear.

37:28.145 --> 37:31.414
[phone rings and clicks]
(male voice, Southern accent)
Yeehaw!

37:31.549 --> 37:34.918
You've reached Gatorland ,
America's premier
gator extravaganza.

37:35.052 --> 37:38.154
You've seen 'em on TV, now
come and see 'em live.
Gatorland .

37:38.289 --> 37:40.423
You're gonna love this park.

37:40.558 --> 37:41.858
Then he says this:

37:41.993 --> 37:43.893
Fer Spanish ,
press two.

37:44.028 --> 37:44.961
[laughter]

37:45.096 --> 37:48.531
Oh . l gotta hear this.

37:48.666 --> 37:52.469
[beep]
l don't speak Spanish but
you're gonna love this park.

37:57.642 --> 38:00.844
l was dyin'!
l called him
like ten times.

38:00.978 --> 38:02.879
Aw, it's the best.

38:03.014 --> 38:06.016
l'm starting to sweat
a little bit, huh .
Too sexy, arrr.

38:06.150 --> 38:08.318
l don't care though ,
l have a lot of
fun , you guys.

38:08.452 --> 38:10.353
You guys have made
a lot of things possible.

38:10.488 --> 38:12.489
At the beginning ,
when l first started ,

38:12.623 --> 38:15.325
coming here to Bakersfield ,
to the Fox Theater,

38:15.459 --> 38:18.128
l used to go to
this taco place,

38:18.262 --> 38:19.596
up the way
called Taco Loco--

38:19.730 --> 38:23.066
[cheering and whistling]

38:23.200 --> 38:26.169
And it's still there.

38:26.304 --> 38:29.139
l love food on wheels,
you know.

38:29.273 --> 38:31.174
But this taco place
has taken it to the
next level .

38:31.309 --> 38:32.842
They're really
really good there,

38:32.977 --> 38:35.078
they're not paying
me nothing , l'm just
talking about 'em ,

38:35.212 --> 38:37.681
but l go to order
and these guys were
kinda, you know--

38:37.815 --> 38:39.616
the girls were cool
but the guys were mean .

38:39.750 --> 38:41.451
l try to order
some food ,
l'm like--

38:41.585 --> 38:42.986
[thuds]
Hello?

38:43.120 --> 38:45.522
And the guy is like,
Què pasò, gordo
wha' you want?

38:45.656 --> 38:47.123
Wha' you want??

38:47.258 --> 38:49.092
Oh , hey, dude,
can l get two tacos,
chicken and a Coke?

38:49.226 --> 38:50.994
Okay. What else?

38:51.128 --> 38:53.363
[laughter]

38:53.497 --> 38:54.431
That's it.

38:54.565 --> 38:55.565
Tsk, awww.

39:03.441 --> 39:05.408
Whatever, dude.

39:05.543 --> 39:06.976
But we had
a lot of fun .

39:07.111 --> 39:08.611
We got to
promote on a lot of
different radio stations

39:08.746 --> 39:10.980
here in town to get the word
out to you guys about the show.

39:11.115 --> 39:14.184
They try to get me set up
on the Spanish radio stations

39:14.318 --> 39:16.953
and l've done
that in the past

39:17.088 --> 39:18.288
and it was okay.

39:18.422 --> 39:20.156
But the last few times
l had to say no

39:20.291 --> 39:24.060
because they put me on the
radio with a guy who's
like "from" Mexico.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.729
And l can speak Spanish

39:25.863 --> 39:29.332
but you put me up against
somebody from the
Motherland , hoo!

39:29.467 --> 39:32.502
l walk in the studio,
l'm dealing with this
one guy, right?

39:32.636 --> 39:33.970
We go on the air
and he's like

39:34.105 --> 39:36.072
[speaks rapid-fire Spanish]

39:38.943 --> 39:40.844
Que paso!

39:40.978 --> 39:44.547
l meet that same guy
in the hallway,

39:44.682 --> 39:46.883
he sounded just like that.

39:47.017 --> 39:47.951
Oh , hey,
how's it goin'?

39:48.085 --> 39:49.252
Que paso? !

39:51.322 --> 39:52.188
Are we on the air?

39:52.323 --> 39:54.924
No! !

39:55.059 --> 39:56.226
Why are you
talking like that?

39:56.360 --> 39:57.994
Porque si ! !

39:58.129 --> 40:00.029
And l freaked out
'cause you imagine
this guy

40:00.164 --> 40:02.332
goes home talking like that
to his wife and his kids?

40:02.466 --> 40:04.100
Come two, three o'clock
in the morning ,

40:04.235 --> 40:06.269
his wife maybe wants
to do a little "something"

40:06.404 --> 40:08.138
and she tells her man ,
[female Mexican accent]
Honey, tonight,

40:08.272 --> 40:10.206
when the kids are sleeping ,
what are you going to
do to me?

40:10.341 --> 40:11.674
Que me vas a hacer?

40:11.809 --> 40:15.779
[speaks rapid-fire Spanish]

40:15.913 --> 40:20.016
Quitarte los calzones

S ì. [whoosh]

You better stop that.

Just have a little fun .

40:50.614 --> 40:53.550

l wasn't sure what was
gonna happen .

40:53.684 --> 40:56.152
A lot of things
have been happening
over the years.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.087
This past year l had
the opportunity

40:58.222 --> 41:01.724
to be on a reality show and
things kind of worked
out a little weird .

41:01.859 --> 41:05.195
Well , but hey, all l can say
is the winner is the winner,

41:05.329 --> 41:07.464
and he did what he did ,
and he got what he got.

41:07.598 --> 41:11.901
But hey, this ain't bad
for sixth place,
is it? Huh?

41:12.036 --> 41:15.772
[cheers
and whistling]

41:15.906 --> 41:19.876
Yeah , l'm
not the last
comic standing ,

41:20.010 --> 41:23.413
but l'm the only one with
a Comedy Central Special .
[laughs] .

41:32.823 --> 41:34.390
l know my mom is
here tonight.

41:34.525 --> 41:38.828
She's like--
[speaks Spanish] .

41:38.963 --> 41:41.498
l love my mom . She's
over here, you guys.
Just say hi to her.

41:41.632 --> 41:42.599
Mom .

41:42.733 --> 41:46.302
[cheering and clapping]

41:46.437 --> 41:49.839
Right there.

41:49.974 --> 41:53.276
That little
woman made me.

41:53.410 --> 41:57.080
And she tells everybody,
(high-pitched female)
No, he came out of here.

41:57.214 --> 42:03.486
Ay, hombre, this is
the road to success.

42:03.621 --> 42:05.822
She is not shy.
She cracks me up
though , man .

42:05.956 --> 42:08.157
She likes what l do
because it's working ,

42:08.292 --> 42:10.026
but she still doesn't
get the jokes.

42:10.160 --> 42:11.661
lt's not that she
doesn't speak English ,

42:11.795 --> 42:13.129
'cause she speaks
perfect English .

42:13.264 --> 42:15.131
She just doesn't
see me as a comedian .

42:15.266 --> 42:17.100
She sees me as her son .

42:17.234 --> 42:20.370
l can't tell her a joke
'cause then she questions
it and kills it.

42:20.504 --> 42:23.573
l could tell her something ,
like, Mom , why did the chicken
cross the road?

42:23.707 --> 42:26.776
And l'll get,
(high-pitched female)
Who let out the chicken?

42:31.181 --> 42:32.782
lt's a joke.

42:32.917 --> 42:35.518
lt's no joke, baboso,
you know how much l pay
for those chickens?

42:40.457 --> 42:41.457
Never mind .

42:41.592 --> 42:43.293
No, you never mind .

42:43.427 --> 42:45.828
lt's cool , though , man .

42:45.963 --> 42:47.730
She's seen me do
a lot of things.

42:47.865 --> 42:50.934
A lot of people say, well ,
you gave your mom a shot,
what about your dad?

42:51.068 --> 42:52.468
Well , he's not
in the picture.

42:52.603 --> 42:55.138
My father, um , ha,

42:55.272 --> 42:58.775
let's put
some beans out there,
my father was a mariachi .

42:58.909 --> 43:02.011
Way--l swear to God--he was
one of those straight-up
you know,

43:02.146 --> 43:04.147
[ra-ta-ta-ta]

43:04.281 --> 43:08.051
And my mom hooked up
with him about 30-plus
years ago one night,

43:08.185 --> 43:11.087
and nine months later,
tan-tan , and l came out--

43:11.221 --> 43:13.957
[laughter]

43:14.091 --> 43:15.858
So l have a vague memory
of my father.

43:15.993 --> 43:18.328
l knew him until
l was about maybe
four years old .

43:18.462 --> 43:20.763
And then apparently
they got the band
back together

43:20.898 --> 43:21.831
and he took off.

43:21.966 --> 43:24.434
[laughter]

43:24.568 --> 43:26.769
l don't remember exactly
what he looks like,

43:26.904 --> 43:28.738
and sometimes
l'll take my mom
out to dinner

43:28.872 --> 43:33.743
and l'll go, Mom , l don't mean
to bug you about this, what
does he look like?

43:33.877 --> 43:36.312
Do you have
any photos l can get
and idea and stuff?

43:36.447 --> 43:38.548
And my mom , she's funny,
she grabs a hot sauce.

43:38.682 --> 43:40.617
[high-pitched female]
He looks like that.

43:46.457 --> 43:50.693
That's funny, verdad?
Eso està funny, verdad?
[laughs and screeches]

43:50.828 --> 43:53.329
He look just like that.

43:53.464 --> 43:55.164
For those of you
that don't know,

43:55.299 --> 43:59.569
there's a picture
of a mariachi on the
bottle of hot sauce.

43:59.703 --> 44:02.305
So, yeah ,
we're doing okay.

44:02.439 --> 44:04.741
Somebody asked me,
they say, Well , on
your first special

44:04.875 --> 44:06.976
that you got to do, you kept
talking about this guy,

44:07.111 --> 44:08.845
this friend of yours
named Felipe.

44:08.979 --> 44:10.780
ls he a real person?

44:10.914 --> 44:12.749
He is a real person .

44:12.883 --> 44:16.619
And he's an old friend .
Known him forever.

44:16.754 --> 44:20.356
But he's one of these comedians
who doesn't know when to stop
being funny.

44:20.491 --> 44:23.159
And that's
why it's hard sometimes
to hang out with the guy,

44:23.293 --> 44:25.161
'cause you know,
l know when to quit.

44:25.295 --> 44:30.700
Especially around cops,
when l hear [gun cocks]
the joke is over.

44:30.834 --> 44:33.903
lf l hear [siren]
you get an apology.

44:34.038 --> 44:36.072
My friend didn't know
when to draw the line

44:36.206 --> 44:39.008
and we were hanging out
one day and sure enough
a freakin' cop got mad ,

44:39.143 --> 44:41.244
(deep male voice)
Oh , you think it's
real funny, huh?

44:41.378 --> 44:44.180
You think it's easy to
be a police officer?
You see that scar?

44:44.314 --> 44:46.049
l got stabbed in '92 .

44:46.183 --> 44:47.950
See that?
Bullet wound , '96 .

44:48.085 --> 44:49.452
What do you got
to say about that?

44:49.586 --> 44:51.187
And l was, like,
l have nothin' to
say about that.

44:51.321 --> 44:53.122
And my friend , Felipe,
is, like, Oh , yeah?

44:53.257 --> 44:54.357
What are you doin'?

44:54.491 --> 44:55.625
Fool , watch this.

44:55.759 --> 44:57.660
[screech]
What are you doin'?

44:57.795 --> 45:00.196
He grabs my shirt,
pulls it up, tells
the cop,

45:00.330 --> 45:03.466
Fool , you see those
stretch marks?

45:03.600 --> 45:05.702
Doughnuts, 1 996 .

45:10.240 --> 45:11.541
l said , Dude,
he's gonna kill us.

45:11.675 --> 45:15.144
l know, fool ,
but it was funny, huh?

45:15.279 --> 45:17.780
And speaking of that,
l get pulled over by
a cop one night,

45:17.915 --> 45:21.918
two minutes after coming
out of a Krispy Kreme
drive-thru . Alright?

45:22.052 --> 45:24.754
Don't get ahead of me,
watch , l made a left turn
instead of making a right

45:24.888 --> 45:25.988
but l wasn't
paying attention

45:26.123 --> 45:27.623
'cause l had a box,
l was, like,

45:27.758 --> 45:30.593
[gasp]
Oh , you're gonna get
it when you get home!

45:30.728 --> 45:32.962
Oh , you've
been so bad .

45:33.097 --> 45:36.232
So--[female screech]
you're gonna get it.

45:36.366 --> 45:39.102
l'm not paying attention ,
l go the wrong way, right?

45:39.236 --> 45:41.170
[rrr]

45:41.305 --> 45:42.872
Sure enough--
[siren]

45:43.006 --> 45:44.040
[shout]
Ohhh !

45:44.174 --> 45:46.209
l pull over.
[rrr and screech]

45:46.343 --> 45:48.845
M m .

45:48.979 --> 45:51.414
Later.

45:51.548 --> 45:53.716
[ba-ba-ba]

45:53.851 --> 45:57.153
l'm sitting there
patiently waiting and
the cop is taking forever.

45:57.287 --> 45:59.689
l said ,
The hell with this,
he's taking too long .

45:59.823 --> 46:01.657
l grab my box,
l put it on my lap,

46:01.792 --> 46:04.527
l flipped it open ,
right? And--[mmmm]

46:04.661 --> 46:07.130
[lascivious chuckle]

46:07.264 --> 46:11.134
[mmm]
[high-pitched screeches]

46:11.268 --> 46:13.970
Oh , l was gonna get nasty.

46:14.104 --> 46:15.805
And just as l was
about to tear it up,

46:15.939 --> 46:18.174
the cop gets to the window
and says the same thing

46:18.308 --> 46:19.609
that they all say, right?

46:19.743 --> 46:21.577
[deep male voice]
You know why
l stopped you?

46:21.712 --> 46:23.012
lt was too easy.

46:23.147 --> 46:24.447
l looked at him
and l said ,

46:24.581 --> 46:26.149
'Cause you can smell it.

46:34.958 --> 46:39.128
Oh , he was dying ,
[deep male]
Son of a bitch !

46:39.263 --> 46:42.732
Whatever, he let me go, man .

46:42.866 --> 46:44.133
So you just gotta be careful .

46:44.268 --> 46:47.336
lf you can make a cop laugh ,
you got a chance.

46:47.471 --> 46:50.206
This past year,
l got to experience
something else.

46:50.340 --> 46:52.975
l experienced
my first Raider game.

46:53.110 --> 46:58.381
[loud cheering ,
clapping , booing]

46:58.515 --> 47:02.018
Now, uh--

47:02.152 --> 47:04.120
hey, listen you guys,

47:04.254 --> 47:07.023
it takes a lot of nerve
for me to say

47:07.157 --> 47:11.093
that after the season
that happened last year

47:11.228 --> 47:14.463
that l'm a fan .
And l became a
fan last year.

47:14.598 --> 47:18.067
[cheering
and whistling]

47:18.202 --> 47:20.002
You can hate it
if you want, but
you know what?

47:20.137 --> 47:21.938
Not only did
l become a fan ,

47:22.072 --> 47:24.207
l did a show
in Oakland .

47:24.341 --> 47:28.110
And l made a couple of
jokes and references
about the team .

47:28.245 --> 47:31.547
And apparently there
were two players
in the audience.

47:31.682 --> 47:34.150
l didn't know that.

47:34.284 --> 47:39.522
Maybe that's why they
lost. They shoulda been
at home, practicing .

47:39.656 --> 47:41.624
But there were two there.

47:41.758 --> 47:43.426
And they
confronted me outside.

47:43.560 --> 47:46.562
They were big guys like so,
You got a problem with
the Raiders, son?

47:46.697 --> 47:49.398
l'm , like,
[screech]

47:49.533 --> 47:51.701
They grabbed me,
picked me up,

47:51.835 --> 47:53.903
and pinned me
against the wall .

47:54.037 --> 47:56.005
Oh , my God .

47:56.139 --> 47:58.174
Luckily, they fumbled
me and l got away.

48:12.256 --> 48:14.323
And people go,
How do you come up with
your material , Gabriel?

48:14.458 --> 48:16.559
How do you come
up with the things
you're gonna say?

48:16.693 --> 48:20.763
Things happen to me and
then instead of just
going to a shrink,

48:20.898 --> 48:22.365
l suck it up
and l come up here

48:22.499 --> 48:25.234
like when l
did the joke about
the freakin' Volkswagen ,

48:25.369 --> 48:28.537
l really used to
own a Volkswagen .

48:28.672 --> 48:30.907
l didn't just go,
Let me see if
this is funny.

48:31.041 --> 48:33.709
l had a Volkswagen .

48:33.844 --> 48:35.111
No, l lived it.

48:35.245 --> 48:36.312
People go, Why
do you wear
Hawaiian shirts?

48:36.446 --> 48:37.880
l've always worn
Hawaiian shirts.

48:38.015 --> 48:39.215
Bottom line is simple.

48:39.349 --> 48:40.283
Why do l wear 'em?

48:40.417 --> 48:43.219
'Cause they fit.

48:43.353 --> 48:44.954
They're colorful ,
and l'm sorry--

48:45.088 --> 48:47.990
When you wear a Hawaiian
shirt and you're living
in the ghetto,

48:48.125 --> 48:50.293
people don't think
you're up to no good .

48:50.427 --> 48:52.495
You're not a gang member
wearing a Hawaiian shirt.

48:52.629 --> 48:54.964
Nobody's gonna take
you serious, you know?

48:55.098 --> 48:56.732
[deep black male]
Where you from?

48:56.867 --> 48:59.135
[male Hawaiian accent]
Oh , Honolulu , eh .

48:59.269 --> 49:01.570
[laughter]

49:01.705 --> 49:06.575
You can't be hard
and colorful .
[laughs] Uh-uh .

49:09.279 --> 49:10.413
No way, man .

49:10.547 --> 49:12.248
And believe me,
l've had my encounters.

49:12.382 --> 49:13.983
l had a little encounter
one time on a plane.

49:14.117 --> 49:15.718
Some guy was getting
a little weird ,

49:15.852 --> 49:17.553
and l'm like,
Uh-uh , no more for me.

49:17.688 --> 49:20.790
Every time l get
on a plane, there's
always drama. Always.

49:20.924 --> 49:26.696
One time l'm flying to Florida
and our plane got hit
by lightning . Uh-huh .

49:26.830 --> 49:30.299
The plane drops 600
feet [whoosh]
straight down .

49:30.434 --> 49:33.669
That was better than
any ride you've ever
been on .

49:33.804 --> 49:35.638
l don't care
who you are,

49:35.772 --> 49:38.240
you could've been freakin'
doin' 20 years in prison ,

49:38.375 --> 49:40.309
you killed a hundred people,

49:40.444 --> 49:42.578
you can be the baddest
toughest dude ever.

49:42.713 --> 49:45.815
When you're in a plane
and it just drops
out of the sky,

49:45.949 --> 49:51.988
[gasps] Woo!
l was gay for
five seconds.

49:52.122 --> 49:56.926
l'm not gonna lie!
[screeches]

49:57.060 --> 49:59.161
[weeping]

49:59.296 --> 50:01.197
[screech]

50:05.168 --> 50:07.970
Oh , l was a brokeback
Mexican , yes, l was.

50:13.643 --> 50:15.811
l was in touch
with myself.

50:15.946 --> 50:19.215
lt was funny, man .

50:19.349 --> 50:22.451
Before l go,
l got one more good
story to tell you .

50:22.586 --> 50:24.387
l took a road trip
about a year ago

50:24.521 --> 50:26.422
after l got rid
of the Beetle

50:26.556 --> 50:29.792
in the SUV. Took a
road trip from LA
to Phoenix

50:29.926 --> 50:31.460
to go perform
at this club.

50:31.595 --> 50:33.229
Let me tell you
who was in the car.

50:33.363 --> 50:36.032
l'm driving ,
l got my buddy
Armando riding shotgun .

50:36.166 --> 50:39.068
He's another Fluffy guy,
we call him Sexy Bitch .

50:39.202 --> 50:41.437
Well , l don't call
him that, his wife
calls him that.

50:41.571 --> 50:43.773
[high-pitched
Mexican female]
He's a sexy bitch !

50:43.907 --> 50:46.242
Anyway, in the back seat
l got my friend , Martin .

50:46.376 --> 50:48.344
Next to him is
my friend , Felipe.

50:48.478 --> 50:51.180
So we take off--
[rrr]

50:51.314 --> 50:54.583
we're on the 1 0 freeway,
we're passing all these
l ndian casinos--

50:54.718 --> 50:57.386
[rrr]
[whoops l ndian style] .

50:57.521 --> 50:59.155
Sorry, we're
stupid like that.

50:59.289 --> 51:02.358
Anyway, all of a sudden
all these cars start
passing me.

51:02.492 --> 51:04.627
[rrr rrr rrr]

51:04.761 --> 51:07.797
l'm getting annoyed
'cause l'm driving
a [loud truck horn] .

51:07.931 --> 51:10.566
l said , Next car
that tries to pass me,
l'm not gonna let 'em .

51:10.700 --> 51:13.769
So l'm looking in the
rear view mirror, waiting ,
looking , waiting , waiting ,

51:13.904 --> 51:16.038
and l see a silver dot.
The silver dot turned out
to be

51:16.173 --> 51:19.408
a little car
with two hoochies in it.

51:19.543 --> 51:21.877
Some of you guys
are going , How do
you know they're hoochies?

51:22.012 --> 51:24.547
'Cause my friend
Martin was in the
back seat going ,

51:24.681 --> 51:28.551
l feel a disturbance
in the force.

51:28.685 --> 51:31.520
They try to go around
and l cut 'em off.
[rrr]

51:31.655 --> 51:33.789
[high-pitched laughter]

51:33.924 --> 51:36.492
l'm having fun ,
they're back there--
[light honk] .

51:36.626 --> 51:38.394
Whatever!
[truck honk]

51:38.528 --> 51:40.996
My friend Felipe is
in the back seat
yelling at me,

51:41.131 --> 51:42.698
[male Mexican accent]
Fool , what
are you doing?

51:42.833 --> 51:44.300
Dude, don't worry,
l'm having fun .

51:44.434 --> 51:45.634
Gabriel , you're
gonna get pulled over.

51:45.769 --> 51:46.969
Dude, l'm okay,
it's cool .

51:47.104 --> 51:48.637
We're arguing ,
going back and forth ,

51:48.772 --> 51:50.439
l'm not paying attention .

51:50.574 --> 51:54.076
l don't see a California
highway patrol officer
creeping up on us.

51:54.211 --> 51:56.378
All of a sudden
l hear--[siren] .

51:56.513 --> 51:59.315
l look at the
speedometer: one oh two.

51:59.449 --> 52:00.483
[audience ohhhs]

52:00.617 --> 52:01.750
Oh , l freaked out.
[screeches] .

52:01.885 --> 52:04.520
l pulled over.
[rrrrrrr]

52:04.654 --> 52:07.523
[braking sound]
[psssssst]

52:07.657 --> 52:10.392
The little car
that was behind me
with the two hoochies,

52:10.527 --> 52:13.062
they got pulled over
because they were
going just as fast,

52:13.196 --> 52:14.130
[rrr and squeak]

52:14.264 --> 52:15.664
[laughter]

52:15.799 --> 52:17.399
l'm in the front seat
of my car, freakin' out.

52:17.534 --> 52:19.368
Oh my God ,
l'm gonna go
to jail .

52:19.503 --> 52:21.070
l'm on the verge of tears.

52:21.204 --> 52:23.539
From the back seat,
l hear my friend Felipe--

52:23.673 --> 52:26.041
Fool , what
are you cryin' for?

52:26.176 --> 52:27.676
What are you
cryin' for, fool?

52:27.811 --> 52:30.346
You're not the one
with weed in his
pocket, are you?

52:35.552 --> 52:38.921
You have drugs
in the car?

52:39.055 --> 52:42.191
l told you to slow
down , didn't l?

52:42.325 --> 52:47.363
But no! Picachu
knows everything .

52:47.497 --> 52:50.232
Shoot! Everybody
roll down your windows.
[frrr frrr]

52:50.367 --> 52:52.835
Air out the car.
Mondo, fart.
Do something , man .

52:52.969 --> 52:54.270
The cop walks
over to the window,

52:54.404 --> 52:57.840
looks in , sees my face,
recognizes me from TV,

52:57.974 --> 53:05.014
he's, like, Hey,
l know you , you're
a comedian .

53:05.148 --> 53:07.249
Yeah , you're that guy
from Comedy Central .

53:07.384 --> 53:09.552
You're the guy that does that
joke about his friend at
a hotel

53:09.686 --> 53:11.987
and you crank-call him
and you call him a
dirty Mexican ,

53:12.122 --> 53:14.023
and then you go
"But it was funny, huh?"

53:14.157 --> 53:16.325
Oh , l love that joke.
That one and when you go,

53:16.459 --> 53:18.460
[high-pitched female]
Chocolate cake!

53:18.595 --> 53:20.029
Ohh , l love that joke!

53:20.163 --> 53:21.964
l hate to do this
to you but we got
two cars involved .

53:22.098 --> 53:23.866
l need your license
and registration .

53:24.000 --> 53:25.668
Okay, here you go.
Here you go.

53:25.802 --> 53:28.904
So he takes my info,
goes back to the car
with the two girls in it,

53:29.039 --> 53:31.440
the whole time he's back
there, l tell everybody
in the car,

53:31.575 --> 53:33.842
Check it out! He
just recognized
me from TV!

53:33.977 --> 53:36.512
Maybe if we have some
fun with him , crack
some jokes,

53:36.646 --> 53:38.380
maybe he won't
take the car.

53:38.515 --> 53:40.382
l don't care if l get
a ticket, but as long as
he doesn't take the car.

53:40.517 --> 53:42.084
Mondo, be silly,
crack a joke.
Martin , be funny.

53:42.219 --> 53:43.752
Felipe.
[deep voice]
What, fool?

53:43.887 --> 53:45.854
Shut the hell up!

53:45.989 --> 53:49.325
So the cop comes back
to the car, What the hell
were you doing out there?

53:49.459 --> 53:51.493
Before l could think
of something funny
to say,

53:51.628 --> 53:52.928
from the back
seat l hear,

53:53.063 --> 53:58.067
Fool , he was testing
the suspension .

53:58.201 --> 54:01.470
Oh , my God . This
pothead's gonna get
me arrested .

54:01.605 --> 54:03.372
Officer, l'm sorry,
that's my friend , Felipe,

54:03.506 --> 54:04.907
that's the guy from
the special ,

54:05.041 --> 54:06.742
the guy who
says "But it
was funny, huh?"

54:06.876 --> 54:08.911
He's just trying
to get me in trouble.
l'm really sorry.

54:09.045 --> 54:10.546
Whatever.

54:10.680 --> 54:12.481
So he goes back to his
squad car with my
driver's license,

54:12.616 --> 54:14.516
and he's swiping it
in a computer.

54:14.651 --> 54:20.122
The whole time he's doing
that, he's being yelled at
from the back seat of my car.

54:20.257 --> 54:23.692
Hey, officer, thank
God you have a computer!

54:23.827 --> 54:29.198
Last week we got stopped
in Mexico, that fool had
a Rolodex.

54:29.332 --> 54:32.434
The cop starts dying .
[laughs with screech]

54:32.569 --> 54:34.236
l go, Oh , we
got him going ,
we got him going .

54:34.371 --> 54:36.171
l told my buddy
Mondo, Give me my CDs.

54:36.306 --> 54:38.540
l take out my
Bad Boys II soundtrack,

54:38.675 --> 54:42.111
and l pop it in , track three
is the theme song to Cops.

54:42.245 --> 54:45.281
l tell my friend , Felipe,
Tell me when the cop
starts walking .

54:45.415 --> 54:47.016
Okay, fool ,
here he comes.

54:47.150 --> 54:51.387
l crank that song
as loud as l could .
[static and beep]

54:51.521 --> 54:58.627
Ha! Bad boys,
what you , what you ,
what you gonna do.

54:58.762 --> 55:04.500
[imitates beat music]

55:04.634 --> 55:07.536
Best part, now the cop
is walking to the beat.

55:07.671 --> 55:14.109
[beat music]

55:14.244 --> 55:16.712
Even better than that,
the two hoochies in
the car

55:16.846 --> 55:19.081
can hear the music
and they're freakin' out.

55:19.215 --> 55:24.453
They're, like, [high-pitched]
Oh my God , we're gonna
be on TV!

55:24.587 --> 55:27.523
The cop goes to the girls,
gives them a ticket,
lets them go.

55:27.657 --> 55:29.558
[rrrrr]

55:29.693 --> 55:33.429
Looks at our car
and at this point, we're
halfway through the song ,

55:33.563 --> 55:36.398
we're, like,
[sings reggae]

55:36.533 --> 55:38.400
♫ Police no give
Me no break ♫

55:38.535 --> 55:39.935
[unintelligible]

55:44.607 --> 55:49.278
Got our arms
out the window
like a bunch of idiots.

55:49.412 --> 55:51.714
The cop is in the middle
of the freeway, dying .

55:51.848 --> 55:53.082
[screech and laugh]

55:53.216 --> 55:54.883
He walks over
to the window
and he's like,

55:55.018 --> 55:55.951
Shut it off!

55:56.086 --> 55:57.252
[screech]
[click]

56:01.358 --> 56:02.858
Yes, sir.

56:02.992 --> 56:05.961
Hands me my license
and the registration ,
and he tells me,

56:06.096 --> 56:09.198
Gabriel , l want you
to do me a big favor,

56:09.332 --> 56:11.934
l want you to keep this
tank under a hundred .

56:12.068 --> 56:14.036
You think you can do that?

56:14.170 --> 56:16.038
Uh-huh .

56:16.172 --> 56:17.339
Do that for me,

56:17.474 --> 56:18.941
keep on doing
what you do,

56:19.075 --> 56:20.843
and you have
yourself a nice day.

56:20.977 --> 56:23.312
But, but, that's it?

56:23.446 --> 56:24.747
No ticket?

56:24.881 --> 56:26.382
No ticket.

56:26.516 --> 56:28.851
l don't know what
possessed me to look
at this man

56:28.985 --> 56:30.452
and go, Why?

56:30.587 --> 56:33.522
[laughter]

56:33.656 --> 56:36.125
How come the girls
got a ticket?

56:36.259 --> 56:37.893
And he tells me
the coolest thing ,

56:38.027 --> 56:40.829
he says,
'Cause they couldn't
make me laugh .

56:40.964 --> 56:50.806
[laughter]
[cheering]

56:50.940 --> 56:52.574
Woo-whee!

56:52.709 --> 56:54.343
You don't
understand , Gabriel ,

56:54.477 --> 56:57.079
l've been on the force
now for 26 years.

56:57.213 --> 57:01.850
This is hands-down the funniest
damn traffic stop l've ever
been a part of.

57:01.985 --> 57:04.953
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to
give two sluts

57:05.088 --> 57:08.490
a ticket while
listening to Cops?

57:08.625 --> 57:11.927
l damn near
pissed myself l
was laughing so hard .

57:12.061 --> 57:14.696
This is going in the books
as one of the funniest things

57:14.831 --> 57:17.466
that ever happened
to a police officer,
l swear to God .

57:17.600 --> 57:18.834
The only story better
than this one

57:18.968 --> 57:20.969
is a buddy of mine
pulled over some fat guy

57:21.104 --> 57:22.404
that gave him doughnuts.

57:34.484 --> 57:39.021
So he starts walking away,
and just as l'm about
to start the car,

57:43.426 --> 57:45.327
So does that mean
l can keep my weed?

57:45.462 --> 57:49.064
[laughter]

57:49.199 --> 57:50.599
l turn around to yell
at my friend ,

57:50.733 --> 57:52.734
Too late, the cop
is at the window,

57:52.869 --> 57:55.103
You wanna run that
by me again , son?

57:55.238 --> 57:57.906
You heard what
l said , fool .

57:58.041 --> 57:59.975
Oh , you think
this a big joke,
don't you?

58:00.109 --> 58:02.344
You think that just
because l gave your
buddy here a break,

58:02.479 --> 58:03.879
l know who he is,
l like what he does,

58:04.013 --> 58:05.747
l don't know you ,
l don't like you .

58:05.882 --> 58:08.083
Step out of the car.

58:08.218 --> 58:10.319
l turn around and
my friend Felipe
is, like,

58:10.453 --> 58:14.189
Whooo. l
am so scared .

58:14.324 --> 58:17.693
And the cop pulls
out his gun ,
[cocks gun]

58:17.827 --> 58:19.595
l'm freakin' out,
Oh my God !

58:19.729 --> 58:21.530
Back seat, my
friend , Felipe:

58:21.664 --> 58:26.335
Whooo. Whooo.
l am so scared .

58:26.469 --> 58:28.904
Fool , he is good .
He is good .

58:29.038 --> 58:31.173
Then he points
it at him .

58:31.307 --> 58:34.243
The look on my
friend Felipe's face,

58:34.377 --> 58:40.215
[gasp]
[whispers]
Priceless!

58:40.350 --> 58:44.820
Are you serious?
Are you serious?

58:44.954 --> 58:48.423
l'm a-go to jail?

58:48.558 --> 58:49.992
The cop was like
[cocks gun]--

58:50.126 --> 58:53.462
Nah , but that
was funny, huh?

58:56.866 --> 58:59.101
l love you , Bakersfield !
Thank you !

58:59.235 --> 59:01.537
[curtain music]

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:02.391
(Martin)
We're gonna bring

01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:04.026
Gabriel back out to
answer some questions
for you .

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.061
You guys wanna
bring Gabriel
back out?

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:10.432
[wild cheering]

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:15.037
Ladies and gentlemen ,
coming back to the stage,
Gabriel lglesias.

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:23.345
Thank you , Martin .

01:01:23.479 --> 01:01:25.747
You pulled it off
bro, congratulations.

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:29.317
l needed that
the first time l--
well , never mind .

01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:33.121
They want to
ask you some
questions, uh ,

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:34.690
Who we got first?

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:36.358
This is a little
different something
we decided to do

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:40.362
because there's gonna
be a DVD release with
special features

01:01:40.496 --> 01:01:42.864
we figured why not,
sometimes people do things

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:45.467
and sometimes people
wanna know information

01:01:45.601 --> 01:01:48.503
and rather than
go on the l nternet,
you can ask the source.

01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:50.439
So, here's you
guys' opportunity,

01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:52.841
anything you
guys wanna ask
me, go for it.

01:01:52.975 --> 01:01:53.909
What's your
name, homey?

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:55.243
My name is Danny.

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:56.545
Where you from?

01:01:56.679 --> 01:01:58.313
Visalia, California.

01:01:58.448 --> 01:01:59.815
Visalia in
the house!

01:01:59.949 --> 01:02:01.183
Go ahead , Danny.

01:02:01.317 --> 01:02:03.385
This past summer l
got on a rollercoaster,

01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:05.287
when l sat down ,
it went click,
click, click.

01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:07.022
How many'd you get?

01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:10.726
Dude, l'm beyond clicks
now. l don't even get on .

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:13.295
Like six years ago, bro,
l could still go
to Disneyland ,

01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:17.999
and lean on--[grrr] .
Now, l'm older, l hang
out by the strollers.

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:22.404
What's your
question , Patricia?

01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:25.273
How does your family
feel about your success?

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:28.643
Um , some of the family
thinks that l'm doing
pretty good .

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:31.446
My mom is happy
'cause she's got a
car and it's paid for.

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:33.281
[laughter]

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.250
There are some members
of the family that think
l've gone Hollywood ,

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:37.385
and l'm like, Okay.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.187
Some of the family
members are really
cool about it,

01:02:39.322 --> 01:02:41.790
and some are just
kinda you know, hmmm .

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:44.226
l love them all ,
but, you know,
hey, whatever.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.894
Not everybody
can get a check.

01:02:46.028 --> 01:02:47.395
[laughter]

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:49.297
Hey, how you doin'?

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:50.432
What's your name?

01:02:50.566 --> 01:02:51.733
(Gabriel)
JuIia!

01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:52.968
I know JuIia.

01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:54.436
You guys go back, eh?

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:56.605
Way back.

01:02:56.739 --> 01:02:57.706
Like that?

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.907
Like that.

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:00.742
My question
is to you ,

01:03:00.877 --> 01:03:03.311
l know you're making

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:08.517
but will you

my fluffy bunny?

01:03:08.651 --> 01:03:10.352
[audience goes oh !]

01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:13.255
"Fluffy bunny?"

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:14.956
Wow.

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:17.893

Thank you , though .

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:28.236
Bye, now.

01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:30.906
Woo!
[screech]

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.808
Juan , Mexican name.

01:03:32.942 --> 01:03:33.875
Yeah .
Què pasò.

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:35.443
How you
doin', bro?

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:37.646
Who's your favorite
stand-up and have
you ever met him?

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.581
My favorite stand-up
comic, Robin WiIIiams,

01:03:39.715 --> 01:03:41.283
and l met him
last year.

01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:42.317
[audience cheers]

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:44.486
Yeah .
Thank you , man .

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.622
What l was curious about
is how you come up
with your material .

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:49.491
How do l come
up with material?

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:51.092
Uh , some people
have writers,

01:03:51.227 --> 01:03:52.861
some comics
are writers,

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:54.496
l don't know how
to sit down and
come up with funny stuff

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.398
and then come out
here and try
to perform it.

01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:57.999
l usually react
to things that
are happening ,

01:03:58.134 --> 01:04:01.937
like people getting
up, walking to the
bathroom , baboso.

01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:04.639
And it's still
the same guy, too.

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:06.575
Things happen to me
on a daily basis,
and l find a way

01:04:06.709 --> 01:04:08.743
to make
them funny, like,
for example,

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:11.847
sometimes at night,
when l go to a drive-thru
and they mess me up,

01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:15.217
l like to go back in line
again , and mess with them .

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:16.685
Like when they come
on the speaker,

01:04:16.819 --> 01:04:18.486
WeIcome to McDonaId'.s,
how can l help you?

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:20.255
l'll just start messing
with them . l'll do like
a girl voice and go,

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:23.225
Oh my God , hi !
[laughs]

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:24.693
You don't just
write that,

01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:26.061
it's kind of
a spur of the
moment type of thing .

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:27.896
Then l come up here
and tell the story.

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:30.866
Everything you hear me talk
about on the shows is usually
a real story.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.801
How are you
handling success?

01:04:32.935 --> 01:04:34.002
How am l handling it?

01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:37.205
l'll let you know
when this airs.

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.307
l'll let you know
when the DVDs come out

01:04:39.442 --> 01:04:41.843
to see if I
hang [unintelligible].

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:44.012
Honestly, bro,

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:46.281
l don't know how
you would say how
you're handling it,

01:04:46.415 --> 01:04:47.849
l don't forget
where l'm from ,

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:50.385
that's exactly why
l wanted to do the
special here

01:04:50.519 --> 01:04:54.823
because it was a--
1 0 years later type
of thing .

01:04:54.957 --> 01:04:56.758
l still have
my original
best friend

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:59.327
from way back
in the day when l
didn't have comedy.

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:01.796
When l would go spend
Christmas at his house.

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:04.165
And l have
people that love
me and care about me

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.301
whether this happens
or doesn't happen .

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:09.104
My brother will still
let me sleep on
his porch .

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:10.238
So, it's going
good , man .

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:11.206
Stay true to
your roots.

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.141
Thank you , bro.

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:16.745
Ladies and gentlemen ,
this is a guy by the
name of Fast Freddy.

01:05:16.879 --> 01:05:21.116
Fast Freddy has
been coming out
to see my shows

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:23.351
for what, a good
three, four years?

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:26.354
2000 you opened up
for Weird Al Yankovic
in San Diego.

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:28.924
What year was that?

01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:30.425
Two thousand .

01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:33.962
So for six years,
you have successfully
stalked me.

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:35.697
[laughter]

01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:38.300
[high-pitched cries]

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:39.768
And made it
to the special .

01:05:39.902 --> 01:05:41.503
This guy right here,
is one of the
greatest fans

01:05:41.637 --> 01:05:43.371
any entertainer
could ever ask for.

01:05:43.506 --> 01:05:44.973
And he's just been
a really really nice guy.

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:46.942
We did a show
in Denver, Colorado,

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:50.478
and he had his
entire family reunion
come to the show.

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:53.348
And any time l said his
name, they're like,

01:05:53.482 --> 01:05:58.119

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:04.926
and sell it
at the Swap-Meet.

01:06:05.061 --> 01:06:07.062
But l really appreciate you

01:06:07.196 --> 01:06:08.530

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:11.266
Oh , yeah .

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.634
But what's your
question , bro?

01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:14.569
You've been all over
the nation , performing .

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:17.272
Where have been
some of your favorite
places to perform?

01:06:17.406 --> 01:06:21.176

l've had a lot of fun places.

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:42.030
One of the most interesting
was in Canada.

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:44.833
l performed
for Canadians. Eh .

01:06:44.967 --> 01:06:48.269
They say "eh" more

01:06:48.404 --> 01:06:49.471
How you doin', eh?

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:51.639

01:06:51.774 --> 01:06:53.141

01:06:53.275 --> 01:06:55.310
There are some places
that l'd rather
not go back,

01:06:55.444 --> 01:06:57.979
l won't mention them
in case they sell the
CD and DVD there.

01:06:58.114 --> 01:06:59.047
What's your name?

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:00.582

01:07:07.923 --> 01:07:09.357
Just messin'
with you , bro.

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:12.027
My question is, what's
your mom's favorite dish

01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:14.796
that she taught

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:16.664
My mom's favorite

she didn't even
wanna cook.

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:27.375
When l was
a little kid ,

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:29.644
my mom would go
play bingo, she
still plays it

01:07:29.779 --> 01:07:31.880

at night,

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:33.048
and l'm like
Mom , l'm hungry.

01:07:33.182 --> 01:07:34.616
(female Mexican accent)
Let's go.

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:36.284
We'd go hit a
Jack in the Box and
it became a routine.

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:38.620
When l was a little kid ,
l used to be like this,

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:41.890
then , years later,
Jack in the Box.

01:07:42.024 --> 01:07:44.826
Mom , what's your

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.227

[high-pitched]
Amàrralos!

01:07:58.607 --> 01:08:01.776
l couldn't take a bath
because there's a bunch
of freakin' corn husks

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:04.079
in the tub
because she's
letting them soak.

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:06.114

[high-pitched]

01:08:08.684 --> 01:08:10.151

I know it's

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:28.903
but it makes me

01:08:29.037 --> 01:08:35.676

l said , Why did the
chicken cross the road?

01:08:49.425 --> 01:08:50.591
And the whole crowd
said , Why?

01:08:50.725 --> 01:08:53.761
And l said ,
To check out the chicks.

01:08:53.895 --> 01:08:55.363

and hopefully it looks
really nice on TV.

01:10:53.349 --> 01:10:56.317
Maybe they'll cut off
a pound or two.

01:10:56.452 --> 01:10:58.019
We'll definitely
be back here,

01:10:58.153 --> 01:11:00.221

M uchas gracias.
Where you at, Rosa?

01:12:41.623 --> 01:12:43.891
We got enough Latinos
in here to start
a march.

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:45.927
That's beautiful .

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:48.896

01:13:03.178 --> 01:13:05.046
Alright, two!

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:08.316
Well , that's all
we need to keep
the white people

01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:13.020
distracted from the
Latinos in the house.

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:15.356
l love black folks.
Black guys have
got to be

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:17.458
the coolest
men on the planet.

01:13:17.593 --> 01:13:18.893
You know that?
That's right.

01:13:19.027 --> 01:13:21.796
l'll tell you right now.
A black guy could punk

01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:23.631
a white guy
into some fashion .

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:26.134
[laughter]

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:30.605
A black guy could show up
wearing a clown suit
talking shit,

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:33.541
it's a clown suit, bitches!

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:35.543
Honk honk, that's
my cell phone, nigga.

01:13:35.677 --> 01:13:37.612
[laughter]

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:42.984
There'd be a white guy behind
him , Holy shit, we gotta get
a clown suit.

01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:45.953
They are cool .
Latinos, we got
it all twisted .

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:49.023
We thought hard work
was gonna do the trick.

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:50.625
lt's hard work
being Latino, right?

01:13:50.759 --> 01:13:54.729
You gotta sneak
in through the desert,

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:58.499
get a job without an l D,

01:13:58.634 --> 01:14:01.035
learn how to speak English .

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:03.571
Black folks tried
hard work for
200 years,

01:14:03.705 --> 01:14:06.941
you see where
that shit got them .

01:14:07.075 --> 01:14:09.210
A boat showed
up to Africa,

01:14:09.344 --> 01:14:12.747
it was a messed-up trip
but a boat showed up.

01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:18.786
Can you imagine if
a boat showed up
in Mexico?

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:22.356
Latinos would be
running each other
over, trying to get on .

01:14:22.491 --> 01:14:24.492
Vamonos, cabron ,
call your tio,

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:28.696
it's free, let's go!

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:34.368
Shit, you think
we fit a lot of
people in a car?

01:14:34.503 --> 01:14:36.037
Mess around and
give us a boat?

01:14:36.171 --> 01:14:41.209
We'll have people hanging
from that anchor,
Take me too!

01:14:41.343 --> 01:14:42.877
Oh , man , l talk
a lot of shit.

01:14:43.011 --> 01:14:44.312
lt looks like we got
a lot of couples
in the house.

01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:46.347
Couples, where you at?
Make some noise, couples.

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:47.782
[much shouting]

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:49.684
Wow.

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:52.587
Better you than me.

01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:56.624
l was married one
time, had a traditional
Latino Catholic wedding .

01:14:56.758 --> 01:14:59.627
Very traditional .
My girlfriend
was pregnant.

01:14:59.761 --> 01:15:01.629
[laughter]

01:15:01.763 --> 01:15:04.065
My son was
the best man .

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:08.603
lt was traditional .
l'm not doing it
again though .

01:15:08.737 --> 01:15:10.605
And l
knew marriage
wasn't for me,

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:14.041
because at the wedding
they were throwing
minute rice.

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:16.210
l knew it wasn't
gonna last, right?

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:21.415
And my favorite part
out of the whole wedding
thing was the bachelor party.

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:22.817
Are you kidding?

01:15:22.951 --> 01:15:25.486
Free beers,
free lapdances,

01:15:25.621 --> 01:15:27.588
that's a good time, right?

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:30.758
Because strip clubs
are expensive when
you gotta pay, right?

01:15:30.893 --> 01:15:33.461
You got a big
ol' cover charge,
you get all mad ,

01:15:33.595 --> 01:15:36.697
l shoulda brought
the Vl P tickets l
got last week.

01:15:36.832 --> 01:15:40.201
You walk in ,
beers are eight bucks,

01:15:40.335 --> 01:15:42.637
lapdances are 25 bucks,

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:45.139
and then they trick you ,
two for one, two for one,

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:47.241
but then
the song's over
in one minute.

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:49.010
What the hell is that?

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:51.212
Who's doing
the music here?
DJ ComeQuick?

01:15:51.346 --> 01:15:53.047
This is bullshit.
lt's horrible.

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:57.084
That is why l like
strip clubs in Mexico.

01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:59.186
That is the
shit right there.

01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:00.655
[cheering]

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:02.990
And if you haven't gone,
you owe it to yourselves

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:05.059
to take a vacation ,
just to check it out.

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:06.494
[light laughter]

01:16:06.628 --> 01:16:08.729
Everybody is welcome
in the Mexican strip club.

01:16:08.864 --> 01:16:10.598
You got your wife,
you got your kids,

01:16:10.732 --> 01:16:13.467
come on in ,
they don't care.

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:15.670
First of aII, there'.s
no cover charge.

01:16:15.804 --> 01:16:18.205
There's a midget
about that big ,

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:21.008
just recruiting people.
He's got horns, whistles,

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:23.644
make it look like
a carnival .
Come on in !

01:16:23.779 --> 01:16:27.381
You walk in ,
no cover charge.

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:30.318
Two-dollar beers.
One-dollar shooters.

01:16:30.452 --> 01:16:34.822
Lapdances, 25 bucks, but
every lapdance has
a happy ending .

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:38.159
That is good times.

01:16:38.293 --> 01:16:42.730
You have got
to be carefuI at
the Mexican strip clubs.

01:16:42.864 --> 01:16:44.231
The girls look young .

01:16:44.366 --> 01:16:46.167
They're legal ,
but they're barely legal .

01:16:46.301 --> 01:16:49.670
lt's like it's gonna
be midnight and they're
like seventeen and a half.

01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:52.807
lt's like, alright.
lt's like a New
Year's countdown .

01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:57.511
Five, four, three, two,
hit the pole, baby,
you're legal .

01:16:57.646 --> 01:17:00.615
l'm telling you , one
of these girls didn't
even have high heels.

01:17:00.749 --> 01:17:02.750
She had tennis shoes.

01:17:02.884 --> 01:17:04.619
She was dancing ,

01:17:04.753 --> 01:17:08.456
little lights were
coming on in the back.

01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:11.058
l'm Martin Moreno, you guys
have been a lot of fun .

01:17:11.193 --> 01:17:12.460

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:15.529
Thank you !

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:22.637
Coming to the stage,
a very very funny man ,

01:17:22.771 --> 01:17:25.706
you might have seen him
at Que Locos, Latino
Laugh Festival .

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:30.578
Please a big hand ,

01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:47.662
[shouts]

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:51.832
Alright. There's advantages
to being short, right?

01:17:51.967 --> 01:17:53.334
Hell , yeah , l could
get drunk quick.

01:17:53.468 --> 01:17:54.602
Two Bud Lites,
l'm gone.

01:17:54.736 --> 01:17:56.303
[laughter]

01:17:56.438 --> 01:17:58.806
There's advantages.
l could stand under
a table

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:02.376
when there's
an earthquake.

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:04.011
l could just stand there.

01:18:07.049 --> 01:18:11.085
You guys good over there?
Yeah , l'm good over here.

01:18:11.219 --> 01:18:12.720
The bathroom
of the airplane,

01:18:12.854 --> 01:18:14.455
l fit in there.
Tall people, you don't
fit in there, huh?

01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:16.323
Your knees are
hittin' the door
like that.

01:18:16.458 --> 01:18:19.393
Not me, that's like
my living room , man .
l'm like woo!

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:21.829
This flight
is takin' forever.

01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:23.764
Let me wash my
hands real quick.

01:18:30.105 --> 01:18:32.606
One thing that sucks
is that people
always know

01:18:32.741 --> 01:18:35.042
what l am for Halloween .

01:18:35.177 --> 01:18:37.778
Tall people,
you can fool
your friends.

01:18:37.913 --> 01:18:40.548
You show up to the
party, everybody's like,
Who's Batman over there?

01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:46.187
l don't know,
but there's Noe
right there.

01:18:46.321 --> 01:18:50.758
Last year l dressed
up as King Kong .

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:53.728
My friends came up
to me, Hey, you're
Curious George,

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:54.962
huh , bro? Come here!

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:04.872
So l was just
watching the movie of
exorcism of Emily Rose.

01:19:05.006 --> 01:19:06.907
Have you seen
that movie?

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:09.777
That's a scary movie, man ,
because the devil could just
pop into you at any time.

01:19:09.911 --> 01:19:11.479
l didn't know
he could do that.

01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:13.681
You know, she was
just walking down
the street,

01:19:13.815 --> 01:19:16.717
How you doin'?
[groans]

01:19:16.852 --> 01:19:18.219
That guy
stayed with her,

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:20.121
(deep male voice)
Honey, l love you ,
l don't care!

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:22.356
[groan]

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:24.024
And then his friends
would get mad ,

01:19:24.159 --> 01:19:25.860
he would take her
to parties, Hey dude,

01:19:25.994 --> 01:19:27.795
your chick is triping
by the punchbowl , look.

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:29.230
[laughter]

01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:32.833
Nobody wants to drink
punch , bro, take her home.

01:19:32.968 --> 01:19:35.803
(deep male voice)
Come on , honey,
let's get out of here.

01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:45.379
Only white people get
possessed by the devil .

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:48.783
l've seen the first
two Exorcists movies, guys.

01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:51.118
Latinos, we don't get
possessed by the devil

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:56.690
because our moms
would beat the shit
out of the devil .

01:19:56.825 --> 01:20:00.494
Our mom with el diablo,
[speaks Spanish angrily] .

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:04.832
Traeme el tapatio,
con el tapatìo se
sale el diablo.

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:06.100
Con el tapatio--

01:20:06.234 --> 01:20:09.203
Hijo de la chingada!
[unintelligible] .

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:19.980
Speaking of the devil , l
just broke up with
my girlfriend .

01:20:20.115 --> 01:20:23.417
Sorry about that.

01:20:23.552 --> 01:20:25.619
lt was hard , man ,
because she had cable.

01:20:25.754 --> 01:20:28.956
[laughter]

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:32.827
Man , she has N FL Preview,
maybe l should wait
till February.

01:20:32.961 --> 01:20:35.396
We're always fighting .
We got in a fight at
six flags.

01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:37.731
We were right there in line
for Superman , the ride.

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:40.568
And there was these cholos
in front of us, playing
around with water guns,

01:20:40.702 --> 01:20:42.503
just shooting each other.
They're [psh psh]

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:45.206
Go Raiders, hey!
[psh psh]

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:48.776
[laughter]

01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:51.378
And some water
started splashing
backward , right?

01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:53.714
She says,
l'm getting wet,
do something !

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:55.950
And l saw
they were cholos,
you know what l mean?

01:20:56.084 --> 01:20:57.651
So l was, like,
Take it, bitch !

01:20:57.786 --> 01:21:01.589
[laughter]

01:21:01.723 --> 01:21:07.595
We just got us splashed ,
you got drenched , you
didn't say nothing !

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:10.097
Now you want me to
go do something?

01:21:10.232 --> 01:21:13.667
She says, Fine, if l
get wet again , l'm
gonna go do something .

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:15.336
l go, Oh , shit.

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.905
So an hour goes by,
and the cholos they
start playing around

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:19.406
with the water guns--
[psh psh]

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:23.010
and she got wet again ,
(female voice)
That's it!

01:21:23.144 --> 01:21:25.713
She ran over there,
she had a full Coke.

01:21:25.847 --> 01:21:29.950
And she threw it on the cholos,
You like getting wet, huh?
You like getting wet?

01:21:30.085 --> 01:21:32.086
You like getting wet?

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:35.389
l'm running behind
her going , No! !

01:21:35.523 --> 01:21:37.858
[laughter]

01:21:37.993 --> 01:21:45.032
The cholos were standing there,
all full of Coke, stunned ,
all sticky,

01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:47.568
Then they looked at me,
Hey, bro, control
your bitch !

01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:53.073
l was, like, Whoa.
See? l told you
you were a bitch .

01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:57.044
Didn't l tell you--?
Hey, bro, l'm not
even with her, dog .

01:21:57.178 --> 01:22:02.750
l don't even know
what l'm doing here,
l can't even get on the rides.

01:22:02.884 --> 01:22:08.856
Go, Raiders.

01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:11.358
So l just turned 30
like 4 years ago.

01:22:11.493 --> 01:22:14.628
All my friends pitched
in , they gave me a Harley
Davidson for my birthday.

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:17.698
lt sucked because
l couldn't reach it.

01:22:17.832 --> 01:22:22.236
l took it back, tried
to get it custom-sized ,
they gave me a Moped .

01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:24.438
Moped sucks, they
have like no power.

01:22:24.572 --> 01:22:27.441
l couldn't go over
a speed bump--
[imitates small motor]

01:22:42.724 --> 01:22:44.925
So l just got a little dog .
l haven't named it yet.

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.660
l like the way white
people name their pets.

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:50.230
You name them
after real people, like,
this is my dog , Benjamin .

01:22:50.365 --> 01:22:52.266
Hi , Benji .

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:55.135
Latinos we don't really care
what we name our pet, we'll
name it after any object.

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:57.438
l went over my cousin's house,
he says l brought a neat dog .

01:22:57.572 --> 01:22:59.139
He's right over there.
Fierro!

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:02.843
[laughter]

01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:05.446
Black people, they always
get big old tough dogs.

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:06.780
A pit bull , [barks] .

01:23:06.915 --> 01:23:08.549

a black guy with
a cat.

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:14.021
[laughter]

01:23:14.155 --> 01:23:16.557
