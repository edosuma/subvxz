WEBVTT

00:01.430 --> 00:03.261
Previously on Elementary...
I'm gonna have to comb through

00:03.300 --> 00:04.528
this all night
if I'm gonna make my deadline.

00:04.570 --> 00:06.765
That's the life _
of a superstar A.D.A., right?

00:06.800 --> 00:08.290
Can I get a rain check?

00:08.340 --> 00:09.136
Of course.

00:11.240 --> 00:12.776
What the hell, man?

00:12.810 --> 00:14.038
How about I buy
you another one?

00:14.080 --> 00:16.503
Oh, you got something
for me, cop?

00:16.550 --> 00:20.077
The guy you hit, his name was
Roy Booker. He's my ex-husband.

00:20.120 --> 00:23.112
It was a setup.
Roy makes a scene
in Chantal's office,

00:23.150 --> 00:24.242
the D.A. thinks
she's distracted,

00:24.290 --> 00:25.518
pulls her off the case.

00:25.550 --> 00:27.381
And I played
right into the plan.

00:27.420 --> 00:29.081
And then you took
early retirement

00:29.130 --> 00:31.052
on a disability claim, right?
Said you tore

00:31.090 --> 00:32.728
your right
rotator cuff?
So?

00:32.760 --> 00:34.352
So the claim is bogus.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.221
You're gonna steer
clear of her, forever.

00:43.570 --> 00:47.108
(speaking inaudibly)

01:00.590 --> 01:03.855
Hey. What's going on?
You saw?

01:03.890 --> 01:06.290
It's kind of hard to miss.
Who were those guys?

01:06.330 --> 01:08.491
Tall one's
my union delegate.

01:08.530 --> 01:10.669
The one who looks
like he's making diamonds

01:10.700 --> 01:12.463
_ in his colon_
IS Internal Affairs.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.264
Last night, I was driving home,

01:15.300 --> 01:17.564
when some guy pulled up next
to me at a light,

01:17.610 --> 01:20.170
started leaning on his horn.
So I roll down my window.

01:20.210 --> 01:22.349
He says that I cut him off
a few blocks back.

01:22.380 --> 01:26.248
Which I didn't. So I tell him
he's got the wrong car.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.168
Light turns green.
I drive off.

01:28.220 --> 01:30.211
This morning,
I get a call from LA.

01:30.250 --> 01:32.252
They say, "Be here by 8:00
and bring your union rep."

01:32.290 --> 01:34.315
The guy from last night

01:34.360 --> 01:36.328
called 911,
gave 'em my plate number.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.352
Said that when I lowered my
window, I drew my weapon on him.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.753
What?

01:40.800 --> 01:43.121
Guy's insane. Obviously.

01:43.170 --> 01:44.364
But try telling that to LA.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.719
They say it's my word
against his.

01:45.770 --> 01:47.658
So what happens now?

01:47.700 --> 01:49.167
They haven't decided yet.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.770
They could put me
on modified assignment

01:51.810 --> 01:53.607
till they sort it all out.
Which is a nice way

01:53.640 --> 01:55.278
of saying "chained
to a desk."

01:55.310 --> 01:57.278
Things go really sideways,
the D.A. could decide

01:57.310 --> 01:59.346
to hit me with criminal charges.

01:59.380 --> 02:01.348
That's not gonna happen.
People know you.

02:01.380 --> 02:03.348
People here know me.
To the rat squad,

02:03.390 --> 02:06.154
I'm just another... opportunity.

02:06.190 --> 02:08.511
You said the D.A. could
press charges. Maybe
Chantal could help?

02:08.560 --> 02:10.357
Uh, I'm gonna call her.
But I got to think

02:10.390 --> 02:12.255
they'll ask my girlfriend
to sit this one out.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.927
Whatever happens,
we're here for you.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.689
Whatever you need,
you let us know.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.505
Hey.

02:23.540 --> 02:25.303
You okay?

02:26.310 --> 02:29.279
Not now.

02:29.310 --> 02:31.278
You want to tell me
what the...

02:31.910 --> 02:33.719
(gasps)

02:36.220 --> 02:37.346
What the hell just happened?

02:40.590 --> 02:41.352
Magic.

02:41.390 --> 02:43.585
Thank you, Bethesda.
That'll be all.

02:48.260 --> 02:49.295
Did you want a turn?

02:49.330 --> 02:50.968
Got anything bigger?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.558
Stay weird, sweetie.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.261
I'll call you
when I'm back from Rome.

02:59.010 --> 03:00.329
(door opens)

03:00.380 --> 03:02.940
(door shuts)

03:02.980 --> 03:04.948
First of all...

03:04.980 --> 03:06.470
Ow! Stop it.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.340
You think that was funny?
Making me think

03:08.380 --> 03:09.779
you were about
to get your head blown off?

03:09.820 --> 03:12.983
The trick you just saw
is known as a bullet catch.

03:13.020 --> 03:16.251
More specifically,
it is the signature trick

03:16.290 --> 03:19.327
of a lauded New York City street
magician named Razr. Come on.

03:21.430 --> 03:24.399
This is from a performance
of his several weeks ago.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.933
RAZR:
Raise the pistol. Aim directly

03:26.970 --> 03:29.302
at my mouth.
I'll raise this hand,

03:29.340 --> 03:31.433
I'll count two, motion three.

03:31.470 --> 03:32.607
Are you ready?

03:32.640 --> 03:33.777
One, two...

03:33.810 --> 03:35.300
(gunshot)

03:35.340 --> 03:36.568
It looks dangerous,

03:36.610 --> 03:38.339
but, in reality,
it's no more hazardous

03:38.380 --> 03:40.371
than brushing your teeth.
The bullet

03:40.420 --> 03:42.285
is never placed
in the gun's chamber, you see?

03:42.320 --> 03:44.413
It is palmed, and then a slug

03:44.450 --> 03:46.452
is hidden beneath
the magician's tongue.

03:46.490 --> 03:48.355
The blank is fired,
head goes back,

03:50.530 --> 03:53.454
That's great. And why the hell
were you doing it?
I was attempting

03:53.500 --> 03:55.491
to estimate the minimum amount
of time Razr's bullet

03:55.530 --> 03:56.963
was in his mouth

03:57.000 --> 03:58.422
the last time
he performed the catch.

03:58.470 --> 04:00.290
I was hoping
it would help me to determine

04:00.340 --> 04:01.739
what kind of poison was used
before the ME.

04:01.770 --> 04:04.364
What poison?
What are you talking about?

04:05.810 --> 04:08.028
Razr, aka Claude Rysher,
was performing

04:08.080 --> 04:09.775
his favorite trick onstage
the other day

04:09.810 --> 04:13.268
when he suddenly turned blue
and died.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.776
He collapsed at the same time
the gun was fired,

04:14.820 --> 04:16.879
leaving many in the audience
to think he'd been shot.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.616
As you can see,
he was not.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.878
The M.E. who performed
the autopsy

04:21.920 --> 04:24.059
found a bullet lodged squarely
in his throat.

04:24.090 --> 04:26.354
She recorded
the death as accidental,

04:26.400 --> 04:27.719
believing
that he had choked.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.728
I found that hard to believe.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.964
Why?
For a brief spell
in London,

04:31.000 --> 04:34.436
I_was the carnal cohort of_a
magICIan named Glorious Gallnda.

04:34.470 --> 04:36.734
I learned repeatedly
and to my great satisfaction

04:36.770 --> 04:38.465
that there is no muscle
more useful

04:38.510 --> 04:41.070
to the skilled illusionist
than his or her tongue.

04:41.110 --> 04:42.702
It comes into play
in any number of tricks

04:42.750 --> 04:44.809
and is exercised constantly.
In Galinda's case,

04:44.850 --> 04:47.569
it was as if she had a third
hand living in her mouth...
I get it.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.588
So you didn't think someone
as skilled as Razr

04:49.620 --> 04:51.645
would've fumbled the slug
he was hiding.

04:52.690 --> 04:54.749
I was right to be suspicious.

04:54.790 --> 04:57.759
Mr. Rysher died
from organophosphate poisoning.

04:57.790 --> 05:00.452
All indications are that
the bullet was soaked in it.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.492
That's why he turned blue.
He must have inhaled

05:03.530 --> 05:05.395
the bullet when
he was struggling to breathe.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.829
_ This is the first time
In my career that a bullet

05:06.870 --> 05:09.509
has taken a life
without being fired.

05:09.540 --> 05:11.508
*

05:18.480 --> 05:19.469
(creaking)

05:19.520 --> 05:21.476
Oh.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.112
This is nice.

05:23.150 --> 05:24.913
Must've been
for one of his tricks.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.588
Or not.

05:26.620 --> 05:28.588
One thing practitioners

05:28.620 --> 05:30.929
of magic tend to have in common
is a fascination

05:30.960 --> 05:32.825
with the macabre.
Depictions of death.

05:32.860 --> 05:34.748
Torture devices.
Instruments of the occult.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.392
These things
find their way

05:36.430 --> 05:38.819
not only into
the magician's act but into

05:38.870 --> 05:41.464
his or her way of life.
You look at the iron maiden

05:41.500 --> 05:44.105
and you think, "How awful."
Mr. Rysher probably looked at it

05:44.140 --> 05:47.371
and thought, "If only I could
find the matching Judas Cradle."

05:47.410 --> 05:50.447
It's a pyramid of iron
set atop a stool.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.449
The victim is disrobed and then
lowered via harness until...

05:53.480 --> 05:54.378
We got it.

05:56.650 --> 05:58.447
Don't look at me.
I've been to your place.

05:58.490 --> 06:00.913
I'm surprised you guys
don't have one of these.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.427
So, this lock was picked
quite recently.

06:02.460 --> 06:04.018
Presumably
when the killer broke in

06:04.060 --> 06:05.550
to poison Mr. Rysher's bullet.

06:05.590 --> 06:07.820
The work is sloppy.
I could say with certainty

06:07.860 --> 06:10.522
that the person we're looking
for is left-handed.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.435
BELL:
I'll get CSU over here

06:12.470 --> 06:13.630
to dust for prints.

06:21.210 --> 06:24.179
Think maybe you should leave
the firearms to me?

06:24.210 --> 06:27.179
It's not real. It's plastic.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.541
Ooh, check this out.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.514
"Razr-- Stop stealing
other people's tricks.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.152
Or else. Anubis."

06:34.190 --> 06:36.454
That's got to be
another magician, right?
(phone chimes)

06:36.490 --> 06:37.889
It's Chantal.

06:37.930 --> 06:39.522
I asked her to tell me
when the guy

06:39.560 --> 06:41.050
who filed the complaint
against you

06:41.100 --> 06:42.863
was giving his statement
at the D.A.‘s office.

06:42.900 --> 06:44.424
She said he just got there.

06:44.470 --> 06:45.619
You know neither one of you

06:45.670 --> 06:47.433
can be a part of that meeting,
right?

06:47.470 --> 06:48.869
I just want
to take a look at him.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.208
Joan".
Listen,

06:50.240 --> 06:51.537
I promise I will tread lightly.

06:51.570 --> 06:52.935
In the meantime,
maybe you and Sherlock

06:52.980 --> 06:54.971
can find out who Anubis is.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.141
(indistinct chatter)

07:01.780 --> 07:04.544
Joan. Over here.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.058
Hey. Did I miss it?

07:07.090 --> 07:09.650
Doesn't take long
to tell a bunch of lies.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.988
That's our guy over there.
Titus Gorham.

07:12.030 --> 07:14.692
He's the one on the right.
I recognize

07:14.730 --> 07:16.152
the cop he's with.
Internal Affairs, right?

07:16.200 --> 07:18.498
Yeah. I guess if they
like your story enough,

07:18.530 --> 07:19.997
they'll help
you hail a cab.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.632
He probably told them

07:21.670 --> 07:23.729
he was afraid Marcus
would show up here.

07:23.770 --> 07:25.658
Did you hear what he said
when he gave his statement?

07:25.710 --> 07:27.473
According to
my colleague,

07:27.510 --> 07:29.740
Mr. Gorham picked Marcus
out of a photo array

07:29.780 --> 07:31.179
and told him the same
story he told I.A.--

07:31.210 --> 07:33.815
that Marcus cut him off,
they got in a shouting match,

07:33.850 --> 07:35.477
and Marcus pulled his weapon.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.511
He gave a lot of detail.

07:37.550 --> 07:39.017
IfI didn't know he was
lying, I'd say he'd make

07:39.050 --> 07:41.086
a hell of a
witness at trial.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.486
This is everything I was able
to dig up on him.

07:46.930 --> 07:48.921
Thanks.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.589
Yeah. I recognize
this letter.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.096
Because I'm the one
who wrote it.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.233
Not sure I'd
call it a letter.

07:56.270 --> 07:58.534
Or do you send all your mail
in guns?

07:59.910 --> 08:01.673
Ms. Newsome,
as you may have guessed,

08:01.710 --> 08:04.804
we were able to identify you
from your stage name, Anubis.

08:04.850 --> 08:06.909
You're a magician also.

08:06.950 --> 08:08.941
Quite an angry magician,
judging by that note.

08:08.980 --> 08:11.187
Claude and I used to date.

08:11.220 --> 08:13.085
We were together
for about a year.

08:13.120 --> 08:14.257
I'd go to his shows,
he'd come to mine.

08:14.290 --> 08:15.917
A few months
after we broke up,

08:15.960 --> 08:17.655
I heard that he was doing
a bunch of my tricks,

08:17.690 --> 08:19.794
including the bullet catch.

08:19.830 --> 08:21.149
It hurt.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.088
Magicians don't do that
to each other.

08:23.130 --> 08:24.529
BELL:
So you sent him

08:24.570 --> 08:25.298
a warning.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.934
He didn't listen.

08:26.970 --> 08:28.597
He caught bullets
till the bitter end.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.835
This is insane.
I called 911 to help,

08:30.870 --> 08:32.576
not to be accused of murder.

08:32.610 --> 08:34.202
911?
Yeah.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.549
When I heard that Claude
had choked, I didn't believe it.

08:36.580 --> 08:38.548
I got referred to a cop
and I told him

08:38.580 --> 08:40.548
that Claude was the master
at the catch.

08:40.580 --> 08:42.241
Even better than me.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.282
I figured someone must have
messed with his bullet.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.880
Sprayed Teflon on it
to make it harder to manipulate

08:46.920 --> 08:49.582
or poisoned it somehow.

08:51.330 --> 08:54.151
The cop that I spoke to,
he didn't tell anybody
that I called, did he?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.054
If you spoke to the police,
this is the first

08:56.100 --> 08:57.567
we're hearing about it.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.999
I knew he wasn't
taking me seriously.

08:59.030 --> 09:00.895
His name was Lassetter.
He's a detective

09:00.940 --> 09:03.636
at the let Precinct.
Talk to him. He'll tell you that

09:03.670 --> 09:05.262
I called. And if he doesn't,
maybe I will kill someone.

09:05.310 --> 09:06.868
Ms. Newsome...

09:06.910 --> 09:08.775
Everyone said that what happened
was an accident.

09:08.810 --> 09:10.072
If I was
the one responsible,

09:10.110 --> 09:11.873
why would I try to tell
the police otherwise?

09:11.910 --> 09:14.117
If we're able to
confirm your story

09:14.150 --> 09:17.540
and if you didn't kill Claude,
who do you think did?

09:18.620 --> 09:20.212
Claude liked to gamble.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.989
Poker, mainly.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.624
You think
he got in over his head?

09:23.660 --> 09:25.355
Racked up a debt
he couldn't pay back?

09:25.390 --> 09:27.654
No. The opposite.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.066
Before he stole all
of my tricks,

09:30.100 --> 09:32.068
his act was mostly card-based.

09:32.100 --> 09:33.658
He could do anything
with them.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.588
Including cheat at poker.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.768
Maybe somebody finally got tired
of losing to him.

09:40.310 --> 09:42.301
(phone chimes)

09:45.150 --> 09:46.947
Angela Newsome's story
checks out.

09:46.980 --> 09:48.311
She did call 911,

09:48.350 --> 09:50.784
and she was transferred
to a Detective Lassetter.

09:50.820 --> 09:52.788
Doesn't prove
she's not our killer...

09:52.820 --> 09:55.152
But it lowers the odds.

09:57.290 --> 10:00.225
Sorry to hear about your
troubles with Internal Affairs.

10:00.260 --> 10:03.320
Thanks.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.326
You need me to assist Watson?

10:05.370 --> 10:08.339
No. I'm pretty sure
a homicide trumps

10:08.370 --> 10:11.203
a phony complaint
to LA.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.878
On the off chance that you do
find yourself deskbound...

10:15.910 --> 10:19.300
I'll understand if you want
to see other detectives.

10:21.220 --> 10:23.188
There.

10:25.150 --> 10:27.152
This won't take long.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.128
(door closes)
You look like a man

10:35.160 --> 10:36.718
who could use some furniture.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.362
Looking for a
table, actually.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.163
I got some great
pieces right over here.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.168
What I want's in the back.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.204
Hey.

10:49.240 --> 10:50.446
You can't be back here.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.971
That's funny.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.817
Neither can this.

10:54.850 --> 10:56.715
All right.

10:56.750 --> 10:58.388
Leave. Now, or I call the cops.

10:58.420 --> 11:00.911
Well, as luck would have it,
there's a detective

11:00.960 --> 11:02.928
from the Major Case squad
sitting right outside.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.154
You could invite him in,
but then you'd have to admit

11:04.190 --> 11:05.987
that you've been running
an illegal card room.

11:06.030 --> 11:07.793
_I've confirmed it
With multiple sources.

11:07.830 --> 11:09.798
What do you want?

11:09.830 --> 11:13.368
A man named Claude Rysher
was one of your regulars.

11:13.400 --> 11:14.799
Also knows as "Razr."

11:14.840 --> 11:15.966
Yeah, I know him. So?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.137
So he's dead.

11:17.170 --> 11:18.239
Murdered, to be precise.

11:18.270 --> 11:19.737
I'm exploring the possibility

11:19.780 --> 11:21.077
that his killer was someone

11:21.110 --> 11:22.236
that he cheated at cards.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.077
Cheated? (scoffs)
No, no way.

11:24.110 --> 11:25.839
No. I run a clean game here.

11:25.880 --> 11:29.111
Well, I know from personal
experience that people like you

11:29.150 --> 11:31.186
vet your customers
thoroughly,

11:31.220 --> 11:32.949
so I refuse to believe
that you were unaware

11:32.990 --> 11:34.150
that your game was
being frequented

11:34.190 --> 11:35.919
by a magician

11:35.960 --> 11:38.451
whose specialty was
card manipulation.

11:38.490 --> 11:43.928
Claude paid me to look
the other way when he played.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.824
I'm gonna need
a list of the names

11:45.870 --> 11:46.996
of all of your regular players.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.496
No, you won't.

11:48.540 --> 11:51.008
He wasn't cheating everyone,
just one guy.

11:51.040 --> 11:54.828
It was like he was,
I don't know, targeting him.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.507
The guy ended up
owing Claude a fortune.

11:56.540 --> 11:58.872
Does this guy have a name?

11:58.910 --> 12:00.116
Hey. Where's Sherlock?

12:00.150 --> 12:01.469
Conference room.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.045
Guy Claude Rysher
was fleecing got here early.

12:04.090 --> 12:05.409
I was just getting him
some water.

12:05.450 --> 12:06.917
Before we go in there

12:06.960 --> 12:08.518
we should talk
about Titus Gorham.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.323
I missed him at
the D.A.'s office,

12:10.360 --> 12:12.123
so I went to the
place where he works.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.388
And?

12:13.430 --> 12:15.125
Chantal said he had
his story down pat.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.195
She was right.

12:16.230 --> 12:17.527
He had answers
for everything.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.923
A lot of detail, too.

12:18.970 --> 12:20.096
Too much detail,
if you ask me.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.961
What do you mean?

12:23.010 --> 12:24.807
Well, when I asked
him about your gun,

12:24.840 --> 12:27.274
he said it was a
Glock 19 nine millimeter.

12:27.310 --> 12:30.279
That's not just right,
it's specific.

12:30.310 --> 12:32.278
You and I both know that you
didn't point your gun at him,

12:32.310 --> 12:34.870
so how did he know
the model and the make?

12:34.920 --> 12:36.217
He also talked about

12:36.250 --> 12:38.047
how you were in "plain clothes."
That's cop talk.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.910
So what are you saying?
I'm saying that it sounded

12:39.960 --> 12:41.951
like he was coached
on what to say by a cop.

12:41.990 --> 12:43.150
You think Internal Affairs...

12:43.190 --> 12:44.782
No. Not them.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.798
Chantal's ex. Roy.

12:46.830 --> 12:48.252
Listen, I can't be sure,

12:48.300 --> 12:50.825
but look at what he tried
to do to her a few months ago.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.269
You really think
he's above getting someone

12:52.300 --> 12:54.837
to file a false complaint
against you?

13:00.610 --> 13:03.340
Mr. Keating here
was just absorbing the news

13:03.380 --> 13:04.847
of Claude Rysher's death.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.019
I didn't do it.

13:07.050 --> 13:09.371
I might have also mentioned
that he's a suspect.

13:09.420 --> 13:12.218
It's our understanding
you owed Claude a lot of money.

13:12.250 --> 13:16.459
Mmm. I did, but I settled up
with him weeks ago.

13:16.490 --> 13:18.355
We were square.
Then I'm sure
you won't mind

13:18.390 --> 13:20.221
showing us your personal
financial records.

13:20.260 --> 13:22.228
You can identify the
payment you issued him.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.160
I would, only I didn't
pay him in cash.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.497
I paid him in information.

13:25.530 --> 13:27.031
He came to see me
at my office.

13:27.070 --> 13:29.288
I had about a-a third
of what I owed him.

13:29.340 --> 13:31.331
I told him I'd get him the rest
by the end of the month.

13:31.370 --> 13:33.531
But he said
he didn't want it.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.377
He didn't even want
the money I had.

13:35.410 --> 13:36.399
Then what did he want?

13:36.440 --> 13:38.101
I'm a private client banker

13:38.150 --> 13:40.015
at Sequoia Liberty.

13:40.050 --> 13:41.415
Claude was interested
in this old

13:41.450 --> 13:44.385
publishing house that used
to do business with us,

13:44.420 --> 13:46.342
Turnleaf Books.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.881
He wanted me to unseal and copy

13:48.920 --> 13:51.229
all of their ledgers from 1963.

13:51.260 --> 13:52.852
Why?

13:52.900 --> 13:54.390
He wouldn't say.

13:56.930 --> 13:59.364
I pulled up everything I could
find from '63 and made copies.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.231
I sent boxes of the stuff

14:01.270 --> 14:04.000
to Claude's apartment,
at least a dozen.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.201
We were there this morning.
We didn't see any boxes.

14:06.240 --> 14:09.038
Well... well, then,
he must have moved them

14:09.080 --> 14:10.502
someplace else.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.040
I think it's more likely
they were taken

14:12.080 --> 14:13.342
by the person who killed him.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.983
Can I have a word?

14:18.520 --> 14:21.887
Obviously, you buy
what that guy is selling.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.252
Why?
Well, firstly,
he's right-handed.

14:24.290 --> 14:26.349
And the person who picked Claude
Rysher's lock was a lefty.

14:26.390 --> 14:28.290
Speaking of, I now
think that the culprit

14:28.330 --> 14:30.195
broke into Rysher's home twice.

14:30.230 --> 14:32.323
Once to douse his bullet,
and another time

14:32.370 --> 14:36.067
after he was dead, to relieve
him of Turnleafs bank records.

14:36.100 --> 14:38.204
Well, if Keating is telling the
truth, why would Rysher care

14:38.240 --> 14:39.639
about 54-year-old
bank records?

14:39.670 --> 14:41.069
You're puzzling as to why
he would forgive

14:41.110 --> 14:42.407
a six-figure debt for them.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.476
I think the_answer's
qUIte Simple.

14:44.510 --> 14:45.977
He believed that the records

14:46.010 --> 14:48.478
held a secret
worth seven figures.

14:57.590 --> 14:58.454
(sighs)

14:58.490 --> 15:01.459
The Art of Sleights
and Deception.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.469
Oh, it's a magician's
how-to book.

15:04.500 --> 15:07.196
Check the publisher
and year of publication.

15:08.970 --> 15:10.938
Farraday, 1963.

15:10.970 --> 15:13.006
The original publisher

15:13.040 --> 15:14.200
was the other company
that Mr. Keating mentioned,

15:14.240 --> 15:15.377
Turnleaf Books.

15:15.410 --> 15:17.002
And that book
is no mere how-to.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.403
It is, in fact,
widely considered

15:18.450 --> 15:20.247
to be the magician's bible.

15:20.280 --> 15:24.512
Well, it looks mostly
like card tricks to me.

15:24.550 --> 15:26.689
You were expecting a section
on how to saw a woman in half?

15:28.260 --> 15:29.579
The book is meant to teach
the fine art

15:29.620 --> 15:31.053
of prestidigitation.

15:31.090 --> 15:32.580
The magic of the hands.

15:32.630 --> 15:35.019
Making your audience
look over here

15:35.060 --> 15:37.199
when your trick
is happening over here.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.061
Is that my credit card?

15:40.100 --> 15:41.738
I didn't have any cash
for the book.

15:41.770 --> 15:44.102
Anyway, the book is a bible,

15:44.140 --> 15:47.109
and it's very hard to find a
magician who doesn't own a copy.

15:47.140 --> 15:49.529
Claude Rysher had his on
a shelf in his living room.

15:49.580 --> 15:51.605
I, myself, perused a copy
when I was younger.

15:51.650 --> 15:54.016
It was supposed to have a
helpful chapter on lock-picking,

15:54.050 --> 15:56.041
but as it turned out,
I was light-years ahead

15:56.080 --> 15:57.547
of anything the book
could have taught me.
Do you want to tell me

15:57.590 --> 15:59.285
how Turnleaf's old bank records

15:59.320 --> 16:01.083
were gonna make Claude Rysher
millions, or not?

16:01.120 --> 16:03.350
Who wrote The Art of Sleights
and Deception?

16:03.390 --> 16:05.529
Walker Elmsley.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.256
Walker Elmsley
is a pseudonym.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.120
Theories abound
as to why

16:10.170 --> 16:11.762
the author wanted to keep
his identity a secret,

16:11.800 --> 16:15.338
but the most likely is that he
feared retribution from the mob.

16:15.370 --> 16:17.702
There are numerous "winks"
in the book that suggest

16:17.740 --> 16:19.037
his methods of card manipulation
could be used

16:19.070 --> 16:20.207
to cheat at their casinos.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.208
Practitioners of magic
are obsessed

16:22.240 --> 16:24.105
with discovering
the author's true identity,

16:24.150 --> 16:27.347
but none more so than a man
named Qumn Malcolm.

16:27.380 --> 16:28.711
The Quinn Malcolm?

16:28.750 --> 16:30.012
You're familiar?

16:30.050 --> 16:31.312
He used to have specials

16:31.350 --> 16:33.159
on TV when I was a kid.

16:33.190 --> 16:35.715
He made the tip of the Empire
State Building disappear once.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.388
I think he has a nightly show
now in Atlantic City.

16:38.430 --> 16:40.694
I came across his name
the same way I came across

16:40.730 --> 16:41.799
Sleights and Deception,

16:41.830 --> 16:45.061
by Googling "Turnleaf"
and "1963."

16:45.100 --> 16:47.034
Uh, right here.
Thank you.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.401
So four-plus decades in magic

16:57.450 --> 17:00.476
have made Quinn Malcolm as
wealthy as he is eccentric.

17:00.520 --> 17:04.479
So in 2007, he offered a
standing price of $2 million

17:04.520 --> 17:07.387
to anyone who could solve
magic's most enduring mystery:

17:07.420 --> 17:10.287
Who wrote his favorite book?

17:10.330 --> 17:12.127
So you figure
that Claude Rysher

17:12.160 --> 17:14.594
thought the answer was in
Turnleafs old bank records?

17:14.630 --> 17:16.154
If a competitor agreed,

17:16.200 --> 17:18.623
it's possible that
he or she killed him

17:18.670 --> 17:20.092
in order to procure them.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.767
So I texted Galinda.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.166
As it turns out,
she opened for Mr. Malcolm

17:24.210 --> 17:26.166
on several occasions
when he toured the U.K.

17:26.210 --> 17:28.235
She gave me his information,
and I left a message,

17:28.280 --> 17:30.168
asking if he could think
of any especially aggressive

17:30.210 --> 17:32.474
seekers of his prize.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.341
And he responded
with this address.

17:34.380 --> 17:37.110
A greengrocer?

17:37.150 --> 17:38.686
Well, like I said,
he's eccentric.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.278
I'm just gonna text him,
tell him we're here.

17:42.860 --> 17:46.455
(phone chimes)

17:46.490 --> 17:48.253
"Regrettably , I will not
be able to meet
you and your partner.

17:48.300 --> 17:51.121
But would she be so kind as to
tell me her favorite melon?"

17:51.170 --> 17:52.762
Obviously, he's
messing with us.

17:52.800 --> 17:53.664
Well, like I said,
he's eccentric.

17:53.700 --> 17:55.588
Eccentric, I know,
but this is stupid.

17:55.640 --> 17:56.459
Would you just...

17:56.500 --> 17:58.229
Okay, honeydew.
Just tell him honeydew.

17:58.270 --> 17:59.339
Honeydew.

18:02.280 --> 18:04.248
(phone chimes)

18:04.280 --> 18:06.601
He wants you to pick one
from the display.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.641
(sighs)

18:19.890 --> 18:21.721
What the hell?

18:25.230 --> 18:27.164
The man is good.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.599
So good.

18:31.340 --> 18:33.479
(speaking Tagalog)

18:39.580 --> 18:41.377
* Are you being free

18:41.420 --> 18:44.184
* Like the wind?

18:46.750 --> 18:49.719
What would you
recommend here?

18:49.760 --> 18:53.298
You can never go
wrong with a burger.

18:53.330 --> 18:57.198
You don't seem surprised
to see me.

18:57.230 --> 19:00.791
You are the one behind
this mess with Titus Gorham.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.263
That a name I'm
supposed to know?

19:03.310 --> 19:06.268
He's the guy you got to file
a false complaint against me.

19:06.310 --> 19:07.538
He say he know me?

19:07.580 --> 19:09.229
No. But it's just
a matter of time

19:09.280 --> 19:10.372
before I find
the connection.

19:10.410 --> 19:11.809
Hmm.

19:11.850 --> 19:14.410
Well, if you say so.

19:14.450 --> 19:17.715
(sighs)
What are you doing, man?

19:17.750 --> 19:19.217
Just paying for my lunch.
No. I mean with Gorham.

19:19.250 --> 19:20.808
You know that I know

19:20.860 --> 19:22.748
you faked your disability claim
with the department.

19:22.790 --> 19:25.759
I tell them,
they'll pull your pension.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.326
(laughs)

19:27.360 --> 19:29.749
Roy.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.360
Couple of weeks ago,
I went to see a new doctor.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.265
He confirmed what
the first one said,

19:34.300 --> 19:35.961
my rotator cuff is no good.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.366
I got the MRI to prove it.

19:38.410 --> 19:41.208
So you got another doctor
to lie for you. So what?

19:41.240 --> 19:44.607
Well, this new guy, he's the
one the department would ask

19:44.650 --> 19:48.370
to examine me if you try
to mess with my pension.

19:48.420 --> 19:50.342
Turns out I'm not the first
ex-cop that he's seen

19:50.390 --> 19:52.244
with my... condition.

19:52.290 --> 19:54.212
You mean you're not
the first cop

19:54.260 --> 19:55.784
who was willing to pay him more.

20:01.930 --> 20:03.466
Whatever you thought
you had on me,

20:03.500 --> 20:05.627
made you think you
could push me around?

20:05.670 --> 20:09.367
You don't.

20:11.270 --> 20:13.329
* As it rolls down...

20:19.680 --> 20:22.240
You really got my name
from Quinn Malcolm?

20:22.280 --> 20:23.645
GREGSON:
We really did.

20:23.690 --> 20:26.579
Along with all
those e-mails.

20:28.020 --> 20:30.329
Surely you recognize
your own correspondence.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.384
Oh. Uh, I do.

20:31.430 --> 20:33.295
It's just, he never wrote back.

20:33.330 --> 20:36.356
I wasn't_ sure these were even
getting through to him.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.890
HOLMES:
In the beginning, your
tone is very friendly.

20:37.930 --> 20:39.625
You were keeping him abreast
of your progress

20:39.670 --> 20:41.661
as you searched
for the real Walker Elmsley.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.361
But over the
last 18 months,

20:43.410 --> 20:44.729
you've become a
little more obsessed.

20:44.770 --> 20:47.637
Bellicose, even,
regarding the $2 million

20:47.680 --> 20:48.931
that Malcolm was offering.

20:48.980 --> 20:50.641
He became worried
about your state of mind.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.409
You're not the only competitor

20:52.450 --> 20:53.974
he was worried about,

20:54.020 --> 20:55.817
but you are the only one
we found

20:55.850 --> 21:00.014
in Claude Rysher's
phone records.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.018
You called him...

21:02.060 --> 21:04.551
on _five different
occa5ions last month.

21:04.590 --> 21:06.922
Now, we're pretty
sure he was after

21:06.960 --> 21:08.757
the same prize
that you were,

21:08.800 --> 21:11.826
and now he's dead.

21:11.870 --> 21:13.997
I understand why you would
want to talk to me.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.759
I did get obsessed

21:16.800 --> 21:19.439
with ﬁnding out who really
wrote Sleights and Deception.

21:19.470 --> 21:22.371
But I didn't have anything to do
with what happened to Claude.

21:22.410 --> 21:24.446
I quit the contest months ago.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.903
I had to.

21:26.950 --> 21:28.713
It was December.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.445
I'd started thinking
the best way

21:30.490 --> 21:32.879
to identify the real Elmsley
was through his illustrator,

21:32.920 --> 21:34.512
the one who drew
all his diagrams.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.687
Hal Posoyan?

21:36.720 --> 21:40.053
I wasn't the first one to try
and solve the mystery that way,

21:40.090 --> 21:41.921
but most people followed
a trail that led

21:41.960 --> 21:43.894
to a Harold Posoyan,

21:43.930 --> 21:46.626
this cartoonist who died
in the Vietnam War.

21:46.670 --> 21:48.035
But not you.

21:48.070 --> 21:49.765
I realized there was

21:49.800 --> 21:53.406
an "H. Posoyan" living at a
retirement community in Phoenix,

21:53.440 --> 21:56.978
but I couldn't get anyone there
to tell me anything about him,

21:57.010 --> 21:59.649
not even what the "H" stood for.

21:59.680 --> 22:03.946
So, I went to Phoenix.

22:03.990 --> 22:07.517
I approached him outside
of his apartment complex

22:07.560 --> 22:09.414
and started asking questions.

22:09.460 --> 22:11.985
He tried to walk away,
but I wouldn't let up.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.055
I followed him.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.661
And then... he fell.

22:17.700 --> 22:20.089
Broke both his hips.

22:21.540 --> 22:24.134
I spent that night in jail,

22:24.170 --> 22:28.379
and... for whatever reason,
that name

22:28.410 --> 22:30.674
kept running through my head--
Hal Posoyan.

22:30.710 --> 22:32.701
Hal Posoyan, Hal Posoyan.

22:32.750 --> 22:35.048
All of a sudden, it hit me.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.878
It's an anagram. You rearrange
the letters, and you get...

22:37.920 --> 22:39.512
"Also A Phony."

22:39.550 --> 22:42.587
I had the wrong guy.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.383
There is no "Hal Posoyan."

22:44.430 --> 22:46.682
The name is made-up.

22:46.730 --> 22:48.755
Which means that the identity
of the person

22:48.800 --> 22:50.665
who illustrated
Sleights and Deception

22:50.700 --> 22:55.569
is as big a mystery
as Walker Elmsley's.

22:55.600 --> 22:59.468
I did call Claude, but it was
only to tell him I was done.

22:59.510 --> 23:00.704
I offered to sell him
the research I'd accumulated.

23:00.740 --> 23:03.129
I knew he was
an Elmsley hunter, and...

23:03.180 --> 23:05.978
I needed the money.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.773
He ended up
writing me a check

23:07.820 --> 23:10.175
for $2,000.
Ask one of our banks

23:10.220 --> 23:12.142
to dig up a copy.
You'll see.

23:12.190 --> 23:14.681
He wrote "Happy Retirement"

23:14.720 --> 23:16.688
in the memo section.

23:19.160 --> 23:20.718
Pick a card,
any card.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.728
What is all this?

23:22.760 --> 23:25.024
Earlier today, the
captain and I met

23:25.070 --> 23:27.664
with Quinn Malcolm's
favorite suspect.

23:27.700 --> 23:30.134
As it turned out, she was
able to alibi herself

23:30.170 --> 23:31.762
for the window of time

23:31.810 --> 23:34.074
in which Claude Rysher's
bullet was poisoned.

23:34.110 --> 23:36.078
So, naturally, you went out

23:36.110 --> 23:38.749
and bought
a few thousand playing cards.

23:38.780 --> 23:40.975
CCS is currently working to
locate the Christian names

23:41.020 --> 23:42.817
and the physical addresses

23:42.850 --> 23:44.078
of other people who
have corresponded

23:44.120 --> 23:45.610
with Malcolm
over the years.

23:45.650 --> 23:47.515
In the meantime,
I thought I would try

23:47.560 --> 23:49.016
and solve the mystery
of who wrote

23:49.060 --> 23:50.789
The Art of Sleights
and Deception myself.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.229
I'm your partner, so I assume

23:52.260 --> 23:54.558
that you'll split
the $2 million with me.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.999
You can have
all of it.

23:56.030 --> 23:57.998
The important thing
is that the competition ends,

23:58.030 --> 23:59.759
'cause once it's over...

23:59.800 --> 24:01.028
The killer won't have reason
to hurt anyone else.

24:01.070 --> 24:02.594
Well, it's only stumped
people for 54 years.

24:02.640 --> 24:04.904
How hard could it be?
That's the spirit.

24:04.940 --> 24:07.704
You haven't
explained the cards.

24:07.740 --> 24:10.072
It was suggested
this afternoon

24:10.110 --> 24:12.078
that the name of the person

24:12.110 --> 24:15.147
who illustrated the
book is also a fake.

24:15.180 --> 24:17.683
I wonder what that
might mean, if anything.

24:17.720 --> 24:20.086
But a closer look
at their handiwork

24:20.120 --> 24:23.829
seemed warranted.

24:23.860 --> 24:27.819
On the left, an illustration
from Sleights and Deception.

24:27.860 --> 24:30.829
On the right, a card
from a Samuels & Sons

24:30.870 --> 24:34.829
1959 Courtesan deck of
playing cards. Do you know why

24:34.870 --> 24:36.792
the King of Hearts is called
"The Suicide King?"

24:36.840 --> 24:38.660
Because of the way
he holds his sword.

24:38.710 --> 24:40.132
It looks like it's
going through his head.

24:40.170 --> 24:41.671
Yes. Now this is true

24:41.710 --> 24:43.177
of virtually all
traditional playing cards

24:43.210 --> 24:45.201
produced over
the last 200 years.

24:45.250 --> 24:48.811
Equally true is that the sword
is held in the left hand.

24:48.850 --> 24:50.818
But look at
the illustration.

24:54.190 --> 24:56.681
Sword is in his right hand.
Yeah. I find this odd.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.187
I wanted to know,
is this a quirk

24:58.230 --> 24:59.822
of a particular card,

24:59.860 --> 25:01.691
or was it something more?
That meant

25:01.730 --> 25:05.291
identifying the card used
by the author in 1963.

25:05.330 --> 25:07.195
I was able to determine
the brand, Samuels & Sons,

25:07.230 --> 25:08.788
from the pattern on the back.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.809
Determining the set--
that was another story.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.604
So you bought a bunch
of sets that they made

25:14.640 --> 25:18.076
before 1963, you saw that
this card was a Courtesan.

25:18.110 --> 25:19.839
I compared cards from that set

25:19.880 --> 25:21.677
to other illustrations
in the book,

25:21.720 --> 25:23.312
and _I found more
de5ign reversals.

25:23.350 --> 25:25.716
The Queen looking left when
she should be looking right.

25:25.750 --> 25:29.117
The Jack holding his scepter
in the wrong hand.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.584
Devotees of Sleights
and Deception

25:32.630 --> 25:34.791
have always assumed
that the illustrator was hired

25:34.830 --> 25:37.048
to draw the hands
of the author

25:37.100 --> 25:39.921
as he performed the tricks,
but if that were the case,

25:39.970 --> 25:42.291
why would any of the elements
in the cards be reversed?

25:42.340 --> 25:43.967
Well, they wouldn't, unless

25:44.010 --> 25:47.639
the illustrator was drawing
his own hands in the mirror.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.830
You think that he and the
author were the same person.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.745
It feels like a breakthrough,

25:51.780 --> 25:54.908
but it puts us no closer
to the man's name.

25:59.290 --> 26:00.689
What?

26:00.720 --> 26:02.984
It's probably nothing, but

26:03.020 --> 26:05.887
these lines here--
they show up in every drawing.

26:05.930 --> 26:06.749
It could just be the way

26:06.790 --> 26:08.724
the illustrator draws hands.

26:08.760 --> 26:10.796
Or?

26:10.830 --> 26:15.995
They're scars from surgery to
correct carpal tunnel syndrome.

26:16.040 --> 26:18.907
The thing is, carpal tunnel
wasn't surgically correctable

26:18.940 --> 26:20.635
until the late 19505.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.932
But if the author underwent
the procedure back then,

26:22.980 --> 26:24.174
he was probably part
of a medical study,

26:24.210 --> 26:25.700
which would mean...

26:25.750 --> 26:27.911
That his name would be
recorded somewhere.

26:27.950 --> 26:31.386
Find the records from the
right study, find the real

26:31.420 --> 26:32.887
Walker Elmsley.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.116
I think you were right.

26:37.160 --> 26:40.379
The author of Sleights and
Deception did participate

26:40.430 --> 26:43.092
in a study of carpal tunnel
surgery in the late 19505.

26:43.130 --> 26:45.667
(sighs)
Oh, good morning to you, too.

26:45.700 --> 26:47.065
There were three happening
at the time--

26:47.100 --> 26:48.658
one in Houston,
one in Minneapolis,

26:48.700 --> 26:49.792
and one in New York.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.364
I started
with the one in New York,

26:51.410 --> 26:53.105
because that's where
the book was published.

26:53.140 --> 26:54.903
Okay.

26:54.940 --> 26:56.976
The study was conducted
at Stuyvesant Memorial.

26:57.010 --> 26:58.409
All documentation
was relegated

26:58.450 --> 27:01.419
to a storage facility
in Queens in 1984.

27:01.450 --> 27:03.179
(sighs)
I'll get dressed.

27:03.220 --> 27:05.609
No need. Look
in the folder.

27:07.890 --> 27:11.155
The storage unit which
held the records was gutted

27:11.190 --> 27:12.987
by a fire a decade ago.

27:13.030 --> 27:14.190
It was confirmed as arson,

27:14.230 --> 27:15.925
but a culprit was
never identified.

27:15.960 --> 27:17.291
Curiously, the
fire took place

27:17.330 --> 27:18.866
less than one
month after

27:18.900 --> 27:21.061
Quinn Malcolm said
he would pay $2 million

27:21.100 --> 27:22.761
for Walker Elmsley's real name.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.199
Curiouser still,

27:24.240 --> 27:25.969
whoever started the fire
picked the lock

27:26.010 --> 27:28.228
on the storage unit
with their left hand.

27:28.280 --> 27:31.909
Just like the person who broke
into Claude Rysher's apartment.

27:31.950 --> 27:33.941
Our killer/arsonist

27:33.980 --> 27:35.208
_ isn‘t interested
in solvmg the mystery

27:35.250 --> 27:36.717
of who wrote
Sleights and Deception.

27:36.750 --> 27:38.149
Quite the opposite.

27:38.190 --> 27:41.353
They want to keep the
author's secret a secret.

27:48.500 --> 27:52.220
Detective Bell?
Ballard Clifton.

27:52.270 --> 27:55.262
These are my colleagues--
Sherlock Holmes, Joan Watson.

27:55.300 --> 27:56.699
My assistant tells me
you have some questions

27:56.740 --> 27:58.037
about a book we published,

27:58.070 --> 27:59.901
The Art of Slights
and Deception.

27:59.940 --> 28:01.202
HOLMES:
We do.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.333
Specifically,
whether it led one of you

28:03.380 --> 28:05.746
to murder a street magician
named Claude Rysher.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.013
No, this is a joke.

28:09.050 --> 28:10.984
Mr. Clifton,
you head up Farraday's

28:11.020 --> 28:12.942
specialty books
division, correct?

28:12.990 --> 28:15.982
Slights and Deception is one
of your perennial money-makers.

28:16.020 --> 28:18.420
It is.
HOLMES: Thanks to the
author being unknown,

28:18.460 --> 28:20.382
you've been in the enviable
position of never having to

28:20.430 --> 28:21.454
pay a cent in royalties.

28:21.500 --> 28:22.956
But, by the
same token,

28:23.000 --> 28:24.865
if his identity were uncovered,

28:24.900 --> 28:26.367
his estate could sue
Farraday Publishing

28:26.400 --> 28:29.039
for past and future payments.

28:29.070 --> 28:30.435
WATSON: We have
reason to believe that

28:30.470 --> 28:32.301
Claude Rysher was killed
because he was getting close

28:32.340 --> 28:34.274
to finding out
who the real author was.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.038
(chuckles)
So you think someone here...

28:37.080 --> 28:38.399
Something funny?

28:38.450 --> 28:39.508
CLIFI'ON:
I'm sorry.

28:39.550 --> 28:41.177
I know someone was murdered

28:41.220 --> 28:43.176
and I don't mean
to be disrespectful,

28:43.220 --> 28:45.347
but we don't_ owe back or
future royalties to anyone.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.415
And we know who wrote The Art
of Slights and Deception,

28:47.450 --> 28:49.281
and we've been paying
his estate all along.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.322
HOLMES: If you're
saying there are heirs,

28:51.360 --> 28:53.180
I'd very much like to meet one.

28:53.230 --> 28:54.822
Well, you just did.

28:54.860 --> 28:56.452
I'm the author's grandson.

28:56.500 --> 29:00.994
My grandfather's name
was Albert Lange.

29:01.040 --> 29:04.532
This is the original signed
contract with Turnleaf Books

29:04.570 --> 29:06.435
back in 1963.

29:06.470 --> 29:09.439
You can see there's language
that shows both parties agree

29:09.480 --> 29:11.300
that his book will be published
under the pseudonym

29:11.350 --> 29:13.079
"Walker Elmsley."

29:13.110 --> 29:15.146
And, to make sure that
there's no paper trail,

29:15.180 --> 29:16.408
Turnleaf would send him
checks for a book that

29:16.450 --> 29:17.610
he would never actually write.

29:17.650 --> 29:20.483
"Turnleaf's Field Guide to
North American Waterfowl."

29:20.520 --> 29:21.953
(Clifton chuckles)

29:21.990 --> 29:24.254
Turnleaf did right
by my grandfather.

29:24.290 --> 29:26.349
And when Farraday bought
Turnleaf, they did the same.

29:26.390 --> 29:28.426
Hell, he's the reason
why I have a job here.

29:28.460 --> 29:29.825
Me and my family have
had a relationship

29:29.860 --> 29:31.259
with this company for decades.

29:31.300 --> 29:34.133
Why didn't he want
his real name on the cover?

29:34.170 --> 29:36.092
Honestly?

29:36.140 --> 29:38.165
He thought it'd be
good for sales.

29:38.210 --> 29:39.507
This book is
about magic,

29:39.540 --> 29:42.202
and magic is about mystery.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.174
At least that's
what he used to say.

29:44.210 --> 29:46.144
Mr. Clifton,
did your grandfather

29:46.180 --> 29:47.943
have carpal tunnel syndrome?

29:47.980 --> 29:51.017
You noticed the scars?

29:51.050 --> 29:52.483
The ones on the hands
in the book?

29:52.520 --> 29:55.182
(chuckles) That's as
close as he ever came

29:55.220 --> 29:56.448
to actually signing his work.

29:56.490 --> 29:58.321
But people never really
seemed to see it,

29:58.360 --> 30:01.352
they think they're just...
creases in the poems.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.062
Who else knows the truth
about your grandfather?

30:04.100 --> 30:06.967
Well, well, uh,
my mother, my sister,

30:07.000 --> 30:08.490
a few of the higher-ups
here at Farraday.

30:08.540 --> 30:12.431
Why?
You said he thought the mystery
was good for sales?

30:12.470 --> 30:14.870
If that's still true today...
Wait, you're wondering

30:14.910 --> 30:16.878
if someone would kill
to keep it going?

30:16.910 --> 30:18.605
No.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.868
No way.

30:22.580 --> 30:24.081
(chuckles)

30:24.120 --> 30:27.419
We have run the
numbers, okay?

30:27.450 --> 30:29.486
I mean, the secret of
who really wrote the book

30:29.520 --> 30:32.023
is good for business,
absolutely.

30:32.060 --> 30:34.324
But someone solving it
would be just as good.

30:34.360 --> 30:36.999
When Quinn Malcolm
offered $2 million

30:37.030 --> 30:38.361
for Walker Elmsley's real name,

30:38.400 --> 30:40.061
sales of the book spiked.

30:40.100 --> 30:42.068
We'll get another spike
when someone claims it.

30:42.100 --> 30:43.397
Mystery kept,

30:43.440 --> 30:45.032
mystery solved,

30:45.070 --> 30:49.006
it all balances out financially.

30:49.040 --> 30:50.632
I don't know who hurt
Claude Rysher.

30:50.680 --> 30:54.377
but it wasn't any of us.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.012
Hey, you guys finding anything

30:56.050 --> 30:58.382
in Ballard Clifton's
box of old junk?

30:58.420 --> 31:00.513
Just a lot of evidence
that he wasn't lying.

31:00.550 --> 31:02.484
He even included a
boyhood picture of himself

31:02.520 --> 31:04.329
playing "Go Fish"
with his grandfather.

31:04.360 --> 31:07.523
HOLMES: Hardly seems fair,
a legendary card shark,

31:07.560 --> 31:09.448
against a
doltish child.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.388
The funny thing is,
Albert Lange wasn't even

31:11.430 --> 31:13.523
a professional magician,
he was a print ad artist

31:13.570 --> 31:15.128
for a _small
advertismg firm.

31:15.170 --> 31:17.161
Magic was just a hobby.
On the bright side,

31:17.200 --> 31:19.407
I guess we could go claim Quinn
Malcolm's $2 million prize.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.431
It's actually quite a setback.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.573
Our theory of motive
has been punctured.

31:23.610 --> 31:25.942
I may have a new one.

31:25.980 --> 31:29.017
Report from CCS
on Rysher's laptop came back.

31:29.050 --> 31:31.484
Turns out he'd been poking
around the dark Web,

31:31.520 --> 31:35.012
hunting for-- get this--
Nazi memorabilia.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.459
That's sick.

31:36.490 --> 31:37.514
But you saw his place,

31:37.560 --> 31:39.027
knick-knacks from
the Third Reich

31:39.060 --> 31:40.482
would fit right in.

31:40.530 --> 31:42.498
Yeah, but there was something
specific he was after,

31:42.530 --> 31:44.464
an anatomy book
written by a doctor

31:44.500 --> 31:46.422
who was stationed at
a concentration camp.

31:46.470 --> 31:48.461
Apparently everything he wrote
was based on autopsies

31:48.500 --> 31:50.536
of people who died there.

31:51.540 --> 31:53.303
Wow, suddenly I'm not so sure

31:53.340 --> 31:55.205
I care who killed Claude Rysher.

31:55.240 --> 31:57.470
Well, two weeks ago,
someone listed

31:57.510 --> 31:59.546
a copy of the book
in an online auction.

31:59.580 --> 32:01.719
Rysher was the winner.

32:01.750 --> 32:04.583
You think perhaps he was killed
by someone he outbid.
Let's just say

32:04.620 --> 32:07.384
I think the people who try
to buy Nazi crap on the Internet

32:07.420 --> 32:09.354
are capable
of all sorts of things.

32:15.460 --> 32:17.223
I don't know what you heard,

32:17.260 --> 32:18.966
but I haven't laid a hand
on a passenger

32:19.000 --> 32:21.969
since that ghetto trash got
in my face back in October.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.231
Mr. Frye...
Look, the judge told me
to take my probation seriously,

32:25.270 --> 32:26.601
and I have.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.279
That's great, but we
didn't ask you down here

32:29.310 --> 32:31.642
to talk about you beating
up people on your bus.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.240
We're here
to talk about a murder.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.976
_You were involved
in an online auction

32:37.020 --> 32:38.578
couple weeks ago.

32:38.620 --> 32:40.485
You were trying to buy
an anatomy book

32:40.520 --> 32:42.613
that was published in Germany
during World War II.

32:42.660 --> 32:44.981
So what?
I'm allowed to do that.

32:45.030 --> 32:47.624
We don't ban books
in this country yet, do we?
WATSON: I get the sense

32:47.660 --> 32:50.151
that the irony of that statement
is lost on you, but no,

32:50.200 --> 32:51.360
we don't care that you bid

32:51.400 --> 32:52.367
on that book.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.367
We care that the guy

32:53.400 --> 32:54.492
who won the auction,

32:54.540 --> 32:56.531
Claude Rysher, got murdered.

32:56.570 --> 32:58.208
You think I did it?

32:58.240 --> 32:59.639
HOLMES: You have
connections

32:59.670 --> 33:02.309
to a long list
of neo-Nazi organizations.

33:02.340 --> 33:03.637
Your own personal
history of violence

33:03.680 --> 33:05.272
is quite impressive.

33:05.310 --> 33:07.540
The_assau|t on the
aforementioned bus passenger

33:07.580 --> 33:09.514
is only the most recent assault
of which we're aware.

33:09.550 --> 33:10.574
You and Mr. Rysher

33:10.620 --> 33:12.542
had been going at each
other during the bidding.

33:12.590 --> 33:14.455
Got pretty heated.

33:14.490 --> 33:16.515
You told him he'd regret
it if he didn't back off.

33:16.560 --> 33:17.686
Yeah, I did.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.688
But there's a big hole
in your theory.

33:19.730 --> 33:20.788
Why would I kill a guy

33:20.830 --> 33:23.526
over a book when I could just
go buy another copy?

33:23.560 --> 33:25.118
WATSON: Because the
book you wanted

33:25.170 --> 33:26.762
is rare, and,
for obvious reasons,

33:26.800 --> 33:28.461
it was discontinued
after the Second World War.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.434
Yeah.

33:30.470 --> 33:33.303
Bu_t "rare" doesn't mean there's
just one in the whole world.

33:33.340 --> 33:35.638
When I lost
that first auction,

33:35.680 --> 33:38.103
I went and found another one.
And I won it.

33:38.150 --> 33:39.549
Go look at my Web history.

33:39.580 --> 33:41.138
Better yet,

33:41.180 --> 33:42.545
I can bring you
the bookI bought,

33:42.580 --> 33:44.582
and you can see it for yourself.

33:44.620 --> 33:46.611
I didn't kill anyone.

33:49.660 --> 33:53.221
You want some_
of my Szechuan shrimp?

33:53.260 --> 33:55.728
Marcus.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.318
Hmm?

33:57.360 --> 33:59.567
Where'd you go?
(Sighs)

33:59.600 --> 34:02.467
Sorry. I, uh...

34:02.500 --> 34:05.799
I was gonna wait
till after dinner.

34:05.840 --> 34:08.400
What is it?

34:08.440 --> 34:11.307
I, uh...

34:11.350 --> 34:14.740
I went to see Roy yesterday.

34:14.780 --> 34:16.418
I looked him in the eye.

34:16.450 --> 34:19.339
Asked him about the report
that got filed against me.

34:19.390 --> 34:20.618
He put Gorham up to it.

34:20.650 --> 34:22.356
No question in my mind.

34:22.390 --> 34:23.687
The whole thing's a setup.

34:23.720 --> 34:25.551
God.

34:25.590 --> 34:27.683
How does he even know this guy?

34:27.730 --> 34:28.856
I don't know.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.221
I looked at every command
Roy ever worked,

34:31.270 --> 34:32.726
every place Gorham lived...

34:32.770 --> 34:35.739
I just can't figure out
how the two of them connect.

34:35.770 --> 34:36.862
I can't prove it.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.561
You don't have to prove
anything to me.

34:38.610 --> 34:39.702
I know what he's capable of.

34:39.740 --> 34:42.436
You know,
we never talked about him.

34:42.480 --> 34:46.746
You're such a good person.

34:46.780 --> 34:48.668
I like to think
you have good taste in men.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.745
But...

34:50.780 --> 34:52.816
your ex is a piece of garbage.

34:52.850 --> 34:56.616
And I just don't understand
how you two were ever a couple.

34:56.660 --> 34:58.287
He wasn't always this way.

34:58.330 --> 34:59.683
I mean, when we met,

34:59.730 --> 35:02.449
I was an intern
in the D.A.'s office.

35:02.500 --> 35:05.765
He was a uni. Neither of us
had two dimes to rub together.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.768
I was living with roommates,

35:07.800 --> 35:09.438
paying off student loans.

35:09.470 --> 35:12.132
He was sleeping on
his sister's floor in Stuy Town.

35:12.170 --> 35:14.172
He wasn't a raging idiot then?

35:14.210 --> 35:16.633
No.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.773
It was good for a while.

35:18.810 --> 35:20.801
Then it wasn't.

35:20.850 --> 35:24.342
_Our_ careers went off
in different directions.

35:24.390 --> 35:25.812
I sort of flew up the ladder.

35:25.850 --> 35:28.683
And Roy failed
his Sergeant's exam.

35:28.720 --> 35:30.551
Got passed up on promotions.

35:30.590 --> 35:32.353
I don't know.

35:32.390 --> 35:34.699
It soured him.

35:34.730 --> 35:37.551
In the end, he...

35:37.600 --> 35:39.568
started to resent me.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.932
Like I said.

35:41.970 --> 35:44.507
Raging idiot.

35:50.880 --> 35:53.701
You said he used to live
in Stuy Town?

35:53.750 --> 35:55.217
That's not in his files.
Yeah.

35:55.250 --> 35:56.740
It was an illegal sublet.

35:56.780 --> 35:59.214
He didn't want it
in his file, so...

35:59.250 --> 36:01.582
Do you remember the building?

36:08.660 --> 36:11.788
That's the anatomy book
from that bus driver?

36:11.830 --> 36:13.969
It feels dirty just to hold it.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.264
Is that your way of telling me
you want me to look at it?

36:16.300 --> 36:17.733
No, I looked at it
for both of us.

36:17.770 --> 36:19.909
Knowing how the book was made,

36:21.940 --> 36:22.975
And yet, one good thing

36:23.010 --> 36:24.671
has come from studying it.

36:24.710 --> 36:25.847
I stared into the abyss, Watson,

36:25.880 --> 36:28.348
and the abyss told me

36:28.380 --> 36:30.439
who killed Claude Rysher.

36:36.460 --> 36:38.849
Sure. Let me call you back.

36:38.890 --> 36:40.619
Detective Bell.

36:40.660 --> 36:42.321
My assistant didn't tell me
you were here.

36:42.360 --> 36:44.897
Yeah, we told her not to.

36:44.930 --> 36:47.899
You never know how a murderer's
gomg to react when they hear

36:47.930 --> 36:49.830
a cadre of police
is here to see them.

36:49.870 --> 36:51.508
You could try
poisoning their bullets,

36:51.540 --> 36:52.939
but I don't fancy your chances.

36:52.970 --> 36:54.972
(sighs) We have
been over this.

36:55.010 --> 36:57.274
No one at this company
has any reason to kill anyone.

36:57.310 --> 36:58.743
Especially me.
Your division

36:58.780 --> 37:01.476
here at Farraday
is "specialty books."

37:01.520 --> 37:03.715
Well, what do you think
of that one?

37:03.750 --> 37:05.411
We borrowed that

37:05.450 --> 37:07.281
from a neo-Nazi.

37:07.320 --> 37:08.287
Not quite the same

37:08.320 --> 37:09.617
as a Nazi Nazi, but...

37:09.660 --> 37:11.389
I think that he
and your grandfather

37:11.430 --> 37:12.749
would have got along swimmingly.

37:12.790 --> 37:14.553
I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.919
I'm talking about
the illustrations

37:15.960 --> 37:17.791
of human anatomy
in that book.

37:17.830 --> 37:19.923
When I forced myself to
crack its spine last night,

37:19.970 --> 37:21.995
I could tell right away
that they were the work

37:22.040 --> 37:23.439
of Albert Lange.

37:23.470 --> 37:24.869
I've been scrutinizing his work

37:24.910 --> 37:26.764
in Sleights and Deception,
you see.

37:26.810 --> 37:28.402
The similarities in style
were unmistakable.

37:28.440 --> 37:31.773
And as it turns out, they were
the work of "A. Lange."

37:31.810 --> 37:33.949
I don't know what to tell you.

37:33.980 --> 37:35.709
That's not my grandfather.

37:35.750 --> 37:37.411
BELL:
But he was German, right?

37:37.450 --> 37:38.917
He emigrated here
in the late '405?

37:38.950 --> 37:42.408
He did, but not
all Germans are Nazis.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.280
We're pretty sure
your grandfather was.

37:44.330 --> 37:45.854
We've reached out
to the Office

37:45.890 --> 37:47.482
of Special Investigations
at the Department of Justice

37:47.530 --> 37:49.327
to confirm it.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.669
If we're right, gotta think
it's gonna deal a blow

37:51.700 --> 37:53.588
to the sales of his other book.

37:53.630 --> 37:55.393
HOLMES:
Sleights and Deception aside,

37:55.440 --> 37:56.896
what will people think
of you and your family?

37:56.940 --> 37:58.760
What will they think
of Farraday Publishing?

37:58.810 --> 38:01.938
You've all been profiting off
the work of a Nazi for decades.

38:01.980 --> 38:05.973
BELL: That's why you killed
Claude Rysher, isn't it?

38:06.010 --> 38:07.739
Somehow, you realized
how close he was getting

38:07.780 --> 38:09.509
to exposing your granddad.

38:09.550 --> 38:11.643
Or maybe he reached out to you,
and maybe it got back to you

38:11.690 --> 38:13.988
that he was poking around
in Turnleaf's old records,

38:14.020 --> 38:16.409
so you broke into his
apartment, and you sabotaged

38:16.460 --> 38:18.018
his favorite magic trick.

38:18.060 --> 38:20.949
Then, after he died, you went
back and took the records,

38:20.990 --> 38:22.958
along with any other
research he'd gathered.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.524
HOLMES:
Including his copy

38:24.570 --> 38:26.367
of the offending anatomy book.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.436
(scoffs)

38:28.470 --> 38:31.507
Maybe you can prove your claims
about my grandfather's past,

38:31.540 --> 38:33.838
but there's no way you can prove
I killed anyone.

38:33.870 --> 38:35.371
HOLMES:
Actually, we can.

38:35.410 --> 38:37.071
Because after you stole
Claude Rysher's book,

38:37.110 --> 38:39.874
which he obtained via auction
on the dark Web,

38:39.910 --> 38:42.947
you were foolish enough to go
right back and sell it yourself.

38:42.980 --> 38:44.516
It's rare, after all,

38:44.550 --> 38:46.745
and a few thousand bucks
is a few thousand bucks.

38:46.790 --> 38:49.350
Your commitment to profiting
from your Nazi grandfather's

38:49.390 --> 38:50.914
exploits is quite remarkable.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.757
(scoffs)
No. That's crazy.

38:52.790 --> 38:55.850
The guy who loaned us that book
said it wasn't as hard

38:55.900 --> 38:57.527
as we thought to
find other copies.

38:57.560 --> 38:58.868
When we looked into that,
we saw

38:58.900 --> 39:00.390
one had just been sold
with basically

39:00.430 --> 39:01.795
the same item description

39:01.840 --> 39:03.694
as the one that
Mr. Rysher bought.

39:03.740 --> 39:06.459
It listed damage
to the lower spine

39:06.510 --> 39:07.659
and a water stain
on the cover,

39:07.710 --> 39:09.507
so we paid the
buyer a visit.

39:09.540 --> 39:11.644
This book-- the one
she got from you--

39:11.680 --> 39:14.444
has your prints and
Rysher's all over it.

39:14.480 --> 39:16.368
Now, if you can
explain that

39:16.420 --> 39:18.069
without copping to his murder,

39:18.120 --> 39:20.918
you're a better magician
than your grandfather was.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.996
This is an interrogation
room, isn't it?

39:30.030 --> 39:31.998
Just somewhere where
we can talk, Mr. Gorham.

39:32.030 --> 39:34.464
Nothing to worry
about this time.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.730
What do you mean
"this time"?

39:36.770 --> 39:38.499
I mean if you don't want
to have to come back here

39:38.540 --> 39:42.135
of a more official conversation,
then sit down and listen up.

39:43.980 --> 39:46.540
When I asked you if you knew
Roy Booker the other day,

39:46.580 --> 39:47.842
you said you didn't.

39:47.880 --> 39:49.677
But from 2006 to 2009,

39:49.720 --> 39:51.039
you lived in
adjacent apartments

39:51.080 --> 39:52.980
in a building in Stuy Town.

39:53.020 --> 39:54.681
Okay.

39:54.720 --> 39:57.712
I still don't know
who he is.

39:57.760 --> 40:00.126
I couldn't tell you the name
of my next-door neighbor now.

40:00.160 --> 40:01.696
WATSON:
In 2008,

40:01.730 --> 40:02.924
police came to your apartment

40:02.960 --> 40:04.769
because a woman was
making a scene.

40:04.800 --> 40:07.894
She said that you refused
to pay her for a massage.

40:07.930 --> 40:10.433
When police ran her name,
they saw she had a record.

40:10.470 --> 40:14.065
You were about to be charged
with patronizing a prostitute,

40:14.110 --> 40:16.738
but your next-door
neighbor was a cop,

40:16.780 --> 40:19.101
and he stepped in

40:19.150 --> 40:21.209
to help smooth things over,
didn't he?

40:21.250 --> 40:23.070
WATSON: That was Roy
Booker, and thanks to him,

40:23.120 --> 40:25.680
none of this ever made it
into the official record.

40:25.720 --> 40:28.086
We're guessing that your wife
never found out about it either.

40:28.120 --> 40:31.055
GREGSON: The thing is,
I asked around at the 15th,

40:31.090 --> 40:33.752
and there was a cop there
who remembered the incident.

40:33.790 --> 40:35.098
And the way he tells it,

40:35.130 --> 40:38.520
you and Booker were real pals.

40:38.570 --> 40:40.060
You felt like you owed Roy.

40:40.100 --> 40:42.989
When he asked you to make up
a story about a detective

40:43.040 --> 40:45.099
pointing a gun at you,
you did.

40:45.140 --> 40:48.029
I think I need to speak
with a lawyer.

40:48.070 --> 40:51.745
That's one option.
Or you could realize that

40:51.780 --> 40:53.975
we're throwing you a lifeline.

40:54.010 --> 40:55.568
Grab it.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.576
When the connection between
you and Roy comes up,

40:57.620 --> 41:00.145
you will be charged with
falsely reporting an incident.

41:00.190 --> 41:03.250
The truth about the call girl
will also become public.

41:03.290 --> 41:05.952
Or you could
get in front of this

41:05.990 --> 41:07.184
while you still can.

41:07.230 --> 41:10.051
Recant your story and
give us a new statement.

41:10.100 --> 41:11.124
WATSON: Either way,
Roy is gonna be

41:11.160 --> 41:14.630
arrested for conspiracy
and criminal solicitation.

41:14.670 --> 41:16.137
So it's your choice

41:16.170 --> 41:18.195
whether or not you want
to go down with him.

41:19.910 --> 41:21.036
It's over?

41:21.070 --> 41:22.799
WATSON:
Roy was arraigned

41:22.840 --> 41:24.034
and released, pending trial.

41:24.080 --> 41:25.900
So as far as
you and I are concerned,

41:25.950 --> 41:26.905
yeah, it's over.

41:26.950 --> 41:29.714
I owe you big time.

41:29.750 --> 41:31.069
My next call was gonna be
to Chantal,

41:31.120 --> 41:32.747
unless you want
to give her the good news.

41:32.790 --> 41:36.157
Matter of fact,
I just got to her place.

41:36.190 --> 41:37.282
I'll tell her everything.

41:39.090 --> 41:41.081
See you then.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.065
* I get drunk off one sip

41:45.100 --> 41:47.625
Chantal?

41:49.740 --> 41:52.163
* I want the entire street
out of town *

41:52.210 --> 41:55.771
* Just so I can
be alone With you *

41:55.810 --> 41:57.607
* Now go when you're ready

41:57.640 --> 41:59.676
* My head's getting heavy...
(line ringing)

41:59.710 --> 42:01.746
(cell phone ringing
nearby)

42:01.780 --> 42:04.112
Chantal?

42:04.150 --> 42:07.017
* I do adore you

42:07.050 --> 42:09.086
* I adore you...

42:09.120 --> 42:11.088
(ringing)
