I believe this to be the only fair way.

Off you go, Cert.

01:56.666 --> 01:57.500
Go on now.

Thank Cerval.

[ship creaking]

02:50.416 --> 02:54.750
So, now that we've chosen a leader…

02:56.750 --> 02:57.958
I will be picking who goes.

02:59.541 --> 03:01.333
[sailors grunting, struggling]

03:01.958 --> 03:04.958
[groaning] All right! All right.

03:05.541 --> 03:07.583
You needn't manhandle me further.

03:10.250 --> 03:11.208
I go willingly.

03:14.208 --> 03:15.833
I shall report what I see.

03:15.916 --> 03:18.041
Yeah. Do that.

03:18.125 --> 03:18.958
Good luck.

Beg your pardon?

Take me.

-[squelching]
-Oh.

04:37.583 --> 04:42.458

04:42.541 --> 04:46.916

-Me eat meat.

04:47.000 --> 04:47.875
Of course.

04:49.041 --> 04:50.125
[squelching]

04:50.208 --> 04:54.833
But first,
you and I must come to an agreement.

-[thanapod chittering]

04:59.541 --> 05:00.791
Most importantly,

05:01.625 --> 05:05.791
I am the only one
who can keep this ship on a straight keel.

05:06.291 --> 05:10.875
Me, you need intact.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.875
Unconsumed.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.125
Do you understand?

05:19.625 --> 05:20.458
Good.

05:22.166 --> 05:25.208
Now, there is one more thing you have…

05:27.916 --> 05:29.250
which I shall require.

06:17.958 --> 06:19.708
[suspenseful music playing]

06:25.583 --> 06:26.500
[man 2] What happened?

06:28.833 --> 06:30.208
[man exhaling sharply]

[man 2] Torrin!

06:46.166 --> 06:48.000
I negotiated with it…

06:51.333 --> 06:54.041
as you must now with me.

06:57.083 --> 07:00.250
Listen carefully,
I am in no mood to repeat myself.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.375
The thing speaks.

07:03.458 --> 07:05.458
You had a conversation with a crustacean?

07:05.541 --> 07:09.291
Which I haven't the patience to explain
beyond saying that it wants passage

07:09.375 --> 07:10.500
to the nearest island.

07:10.583 --> 07:12.916
We saw that beast do
exactly what it pleased.

07:13.000 --> 07:13.833
[panting]

07:13.916 --> 07:15.916
You'd have us believe
you will go up against it?

07:16.000 --> 07:19.416
If, in fact, we do transport it
in the hopes it will spare our lives,

07:19.500 --> 07:21.041
we have nothing substantial to feed it.

07:21.125 --> 07:23.541
And as it has acquired a taste for…

07:24.041 --> 07:25.750
[footsteps approaching]

07:27.500 --> 07:28.625
[man grunting]

07:29.791 --> 07:33.458
What about him then?
He's already half done, isn't he?

07:33.958 --> 07:35.083
Yeah, he looks quite unwell.

07:35.166 --> 07:37.500
He's half more alive
than anyone else will be

07:37.583 --> 07:39.708
that points a crooked finger
at my brother.

07:39.791 --> 07:40.625
Enough!

07:41.791 --> 07:42.875
[sighing heavily]

07:43.416 --> 07:45.875
We reside together in this misfortune.

07:45.958 --> 07:48.250
Which puts us right back where we started.

07:48.875 --> 07:50.708
-Huh?
-But, Chantre, you are correct.

07:51.208 --> 07:54.916
We find ourselves faced again
with a grim and terrible decision.

07:57.916 --> 07:58.750
Unless

08:00.208 --> 08:01.666
it's already been made.

[crunching]

08:28.500 --> 08:29.333
[Torrin sighing]

08:29.833 --> 08:30.833
Phaiden Island.

08:32.375 --> 08:34.333
This is where it wants to be taken.

08:35.333 --> 08:38.541
With the wind at our backs,
it's still another day and a half.

08:38.625 --> 08:40.625
And allowing this thanapod ashore

08:40.708 --> 08:44.458
would mean unleashing it
on unsuspecting Phaiden citizenry.

08:44.541 --> 08:45.375
Sounds good.

08:45.458 --> 08:46.333
[scoffing]

08:48.000 --> 08:50.666
Just as soon spit on you as nod,
in my experience.

08:50.750 --> 08:52.083
That happened to me.

08:52.875 --> 08:53.750
Twice.

08:53.833 --> 08:57.833
Nevertheless,
I propose another possibility.

08:58.541 --> 09:01.250
These nameless islands
further on are deserted.

09:01.333 --> 09:04.791
We may be able to take the monster there
without it even realizing.

09:04.875 --> 09:10.500
This course of action offers a chance
at sparing countless innocent lives.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.125
[ship creaking]

09:15.000 --> 09:16.833
Fine, we shall put it to a vote.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.708
Each of you will have equal voice.

09:20.333 --> 09:24.541
It will be a secret ballot with no man
knowing any other man's choice.

09:25.708 --> 09:28.083
You will privately mark
and fold your ballots,

09:28.166 --> 09:29.750
then return them to me.

09:30.250 --> 09:33.750
A circle will indicate a vote
to sail beyond the peopled shores

09:33.833 --> 09:35.083
despite the risk.

09:35.166 --> 09:39.416
And an X is a vote
for a shorter voyage to Phaiden Island.

09:39.500 --> 09:43.750
X means you fulfill the creature's wish.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.625
[suspenseful music playing]

09:45.708 --> 09:47.166
Let conscience be your guide.

[ominous whooshing]

09:57.708 --> 09:59.166
[seagulls warbling]

10:12.833 --> 10:14.458
I begin with a confession.

10:15.541 --> 10:18.375
By a folded corner here,
an irregular edge there,

10:18.458 --> 10:22.291
I made each of these ballots unique,
unbeknownst to anyone but myself.

10:22.875 --> 10:26.541
Having paid strict attention
as I handed them out, the duty falls to me

10:26.625 --> 10:31.791
to reveal I have succeeded
in ferreting out the cowards in our midst.

10:31.875 --> 10:33.708
-W-what did he say?
-He said there are cowards.

10:33.791 --> 10:36.250
Craven cowards
who would gladly betray a stranger

10:36.333 --> 10:38.458
if it meant saving their own skin.

10:38.958 --> 10:41.958
Two cowards
who voted to pass our terrible burden

10:42.041 --> 10:46.541
to the defenseless men,
women, and children of Phaiden Island.

10:47.583 --> 10:50.250
-Mr. Melis, step to your right, please.
-Excuse me?

10:51.083 --> 10:52.791
He said, "Step to your right."

10:54.166 --> 10:55.000
Okay.

10:55.833 --> 10:57.083
Very kind, thank you.

United we are at last,
in spirit, goal, and purpose.

Phaiden Island.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.083
Yes.

Hungry.

13:21.375 --> 13:22.958
[suspenseful music swelling]

13:23.625 --> 13:24.458
Of course.

13:25.208 --> 13:26.583
So many mouths to feed.

13:26.666 --> 13:31.125
Must eat soon.

13:32.083 --> 13:36.000
We must eat.

13:37.791 --> 13:38.666
Hmm.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.250
There lies Phaiden Island.

13:57.208 --> 13:58.916
Closer by the minute.

14:04.458 --> 14:07.416
I am willing to see
the failed attempt on my life

14:07.500 --> 14:10.250
as an expression of low morale,

14:10.333 --> 14:14.041
but this nightmare is very nearly
at an end.

14:14.125 --> 14:15.083
I swear it.

14:15.166 --> 14:17.833
And tomorrow, sir?
If your friend below us gets--

14:17.916 --> 14:19.625
Maintain course!

14:20.666 --> 14:22.541
And wake me at the toll of the hour.

16:39.291 --> 16:41.291
[squelching]

16:42.291 --> 16:43.875
[Torrin] In the spirit of fairness,

16:43.958 --> 16:46.083
I lied before. [panting]

16:46.166 --> 16:48.166
I didn't actually mark the ballots.

16:48.250 --> 16:49.250
[thudding]

16:52.125 --> 16:53.208
I didn't have to.

16:54.791 --> 16:55.958
[man] Whoa, whoa.

16:56.708 --> 16:58.083
Whoa! [yelling]

16:58.166 --> 17:01.666
Every one of you made an X.

17:01.750 --> 17:02.833
[crunching]

17:10.250 --> 17:12.125
[exhaling slowly]

17:18.875 --> 17:20.208
[bird squawking]

17:29.625 --> 17:30.791
[Torrin] We've arrived!

17:37.458 --> 17:38.666
Show yourself.

17:46.291 --> 17:49.166
Phaiden Island.

17:49.250 --> 17:50.250
[Torrin] Yes.

17:53.416 --> 17:54.375
As you know,

17:55.416 --> 17:58.500
there's not much good eating
on a jable shark.

17:59.791 --> 18:00.625
The meat

18:01.625 --> 18:02.500
is greasy.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.333
[gurgling]

18:06.041 --> 18:07.166
[Torrin] And the hide

18:08.666 --> 18:10.625
is too tough for any garment.

18:11.875 --> 18:13.375
[gurgling]

18:14.250 --> 18:17.625
But what they do have in abundance…

18:19.916 --> 18:20.833
is oil.

18:22.833 --> 18:25.291
Shell protects.

18:25.375 --> 18:26.916
It's not for you.

18:33.250 --> 18:34.750
[thanopod screeching]

18:35.250 --> 18:36.958
[suspenseful music swelling]

19:00.500 --> 19:02.125
[thanopod screeching]

19:02.208 --> 19:03.500
[intense music playing]

19:03.583 --> 19:05.000
[Torrin gasping, grunting]

19:06.000 --> 19:07.250
[thanopod screeching

19:09.791 --> 19:11.708
[Torrin grunting]

19:16.333 --> 19:17.375
[ship cracking]

19:18.500 --> 19:20.125
[thanopod screeching]

19:25.583 --> 19:27.583
[breathing heavily]

19:30.500 --> 19:32.375
[breath shuddering]

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
[straining]

19:38.583 --> 19:39.416
[grunting]

19:49.875 --> 19:51.875
[music fades]

19:57.375 --> 19:59.250
[electronic warbling]

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
[closing theme music playing]

21:12.583 --> 21:13.833
[music fades]
