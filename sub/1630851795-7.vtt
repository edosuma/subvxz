WEBVTT

00:05.840 --> 00:07.873
We got one ready to load up.

00:07.875 --> 00:10.209
<i> [narrator] on this episode</i>
<i>  of moonshiners.</i>

00:10.611 --> 00:11.910
Our first run,

00:11.912 --> 00:14.813
we got run in on
and lost everything.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.950
<i> We gotta do everything we can,</i>
<i>  to make it back on top.</i>

00:17.952 --> 00:19.018
<i>  Because right now,</i>
<i>  we're scrambling.</i>

00:19.020 --> 00:20.452
Oh, baby.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.354
[richard] we're cooking, baby.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.556
Absinthe is a crazy
complicated drink.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.525
<i>  This is only our</i>
<i>  second time,</i>
<i>  doing this run.</i>

00:26.527 --> 00:29.795
This is a much larger run
that the first absinthe run
we did.

00:29.797 --> 00:30.896
Taste a little different,
than last time.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.031
We got a problem.

00:32.033 --> 00:35.034
We promised beaz
100 gallons, rapid aged,

00:35.036 --> 00:35.934
five-year-old liquor.

00:35.936 --> 00:38.804
<i> [mark] it's a $22,500 payday.</i>

00:38.806 --> 00:41.040
<i>  We don't know,</i>
<i>  if it will work or not.</i>

00:42.610 --> 00:45.244
<i> [man] this is how</i>
<i>  we make the moonshine.</i>

00:48.082 --> 00:49.815
We're ready to
start pumping water.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.116
-All right.
-Ignition.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.118
[cell phone ringing]

00:53.120 --> 00:53.986
yellow.

00:53.988 --> 00:55.387
<i> [beaz] hey, man,</i>
<i>  what are you doing?</i>

00:55.389 --> 00:57.022
What's up, beaz?

00:57.024 --> 00:59.525
<i> [beaz] um, it's been</i>
<i>  six months</i>

00:59.527 --> 01:03.562
<i>  since I placed the order</i>
<i>  for the 100 gallons of</i>
<i>  the tennessee whiskey.</i>

01:03.564 --> 01:06.865
<i> [narrator] in tennessee,</i>
<i>  on the cocke county line,</i>

01:06.867 --> 01:10.702
<i>  just as mark and digger</i>
<i>  mash in their first,</i>
<i>  large scale run,</i>

01:10.704 --> 01:13.705
<i>  with world-class</i>
<i>  limestone creek water,</i>

01:13.707 --> 01:17.810
<i>  an anxious client calls,</i>
<i>  to check on an overdue order.</i>

01:17.812 --> 01:21.914
You know, time has a way
of getting away from me,
and he reminded us,

01:21.916 --> 01:23.816
that it had been six months,

01:23.818 --> 01:27.886
since we promised him,
a hundred gallons of
aged tennessee whiskey.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.188
<i> [beaz] can I come, get that?</i>

01:29.924 --> 01:31.090
Well, not today.

01:31.092 --> 01:33.092
But how about, about a week?

01:33.127 --> 01:34.193
<i> [beaz] okay.</i>

01:34.195 --> 01:35.160
Well, here's the deal.

01:35.162 --> 01:37.429
You wanted
five year aged, right?

01:38.165 --> 01:39.064
[beaz] that's correct.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.834
All right. Well, to get
six month liquor,

01:41.836 --> 01:44.536
to match up to
the flavor profile,

01:44.538 --> 01:47.906
and the color
of a five-year liquor.

01:47.908 --> 01:50.976
We had to take it to
the east coast,
and put it on a boat.

01:51.045 --> 01:52.244
<i> [beaz] you did what?</i>

01:52.546 --> 01:55.080
I need some product.

01:55.082 --> 01:58.851
You just promised,
two barrels of
five-year-old liquor.

01:58.853 --> 01:59.651
You ain't got nothing.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.421
I got a process, sea-aging.

02:02.423 --> 02:06.024
<i>  Put it on a boat,</i>
<i>  in that salty environment,</i>
<i>  bouncing around.</i>

02:06.026 --> 02:08.060
<i>  One month's</i>
<i>  equivalent to one year.</i>

02:08.062 --> 02:09.261
We're almost there.

02:09.830 --> 02:10.996
[grunts]

02:11.065 --> 02:11.864
we barreled it up,

02:11.866 --> 02:14.399
hauled it to
north carolina coast.

02:14.401 --> 02:15.834
And then,
we put it on
a shrimp boat.

02:15.836 --> 02:19.004
And it goes out twice a day.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.372
<i> [beaz] I had no idea,</i>
<i>  you could do that.</i>

02:20.374 --> 02:21.807
Well, we don't either yet.

02:21.809 --> 02:25.777
<i> [beaz] so, you don't</i>
<i>  really know,</i>
<i>  if it turned out.</i>

02:25.779 --> 02:30.549
I know that other companies
have made sea-aging work.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.684
Whether we have,
it's rather remaining
to be seen.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.621
<i> [beaz] is it still</i>
<i>  $225 a gallon?</i>

02:35.623 --> 02:37.823
<i>  Is it more</i>
<i>  because you had to</i>
<i>  put it on that boat?</i>

02:37.825 --> 02:40.659
We priced it
at that point
because of that.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.828
You know, at $225 a gallon.

02:42.830 --> 02:46.832
That's $22,500,
we got on the line.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.034
On some liquor,
we haven't even tasted yet.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.736
<i> [beaz] all right, brother.</i>

02:50.738 --> 02:52.004
<i> See you in about a week or so.</i>

02:52.006 --> 02:52.738
All right. Be safe.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.673
Yes, man.
Old digger's going south.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.808
We're gonna go,
try to retrieve
our tennessee whiskey.

02:56.810 --> 02:59.211
That's been sea-aging
for six months.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.088
Place is looking little
naked, ain't it?

03:10.124 --> 03:10.889
Yes it is.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.324
David is on the way.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.725
He'll be here in a little bit
and get two more.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.694
Well, which one of us
is gonna work with him?

03:15.696 --> 03:17.796
-He's gonna be by himself.
-All right.

03:17.798 --> 03:21.833
<i> [narrator] across</i>
<i>  the state line in</i>
<i>  franklin county, virginia,</i>

03:21.835 --> 03:24.870
<i>  after unknown intruders,</i>
<i>  raided their still site.</i>

03:24.872 --> 03:26.838
<i>  Tickle, henry, and kenny,</i>

03:26.840 --> 03:29.741
<i>  rebuild a full-scale</i>
<i>  moonshine operation.</i>

03:29.743 --> 03:32.978
<i>  While trying to</i>
<i>  keep low profile.</i>

03:32.980 --> 03:35.781
This year,
has not started off
good for us at all.

03:35.783 --> 03:39.318
We've really got
ourselves in a hole,
that we got to climb out of.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.153
-How does that look?
-That looks good.

03:41.155 --> 03:42.788
Gonna do a little thing,
that my dad used to do,
all the time.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.157
He never put
all his eggs,
in one basket.

03:45.159 --> 03:46.758
<i>  He would have</i>
<i>  four-five pots, here.</i>

03:46.760 --> 03:47.826
<i>  Four-five pots over, here.</i>

03:47.828 --> 03:49.428
We're gonna do the same thing.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.763
<i> [narrator] henry's father,</i>
<i>  amos law,</i>

03:51.765 --> 03:55.734
<i>  was one of the most</i>
<i>  infamous moonshiners,</i>
<i>  in virginia history.</i>

03:55.736 --> 03:57.636
<i>  The feds estimate,</i>
<i>  that he produced,</i>

03:57.638 --> 04:02.007
<i>  half a million gallons</i>
<i>  of liquor, in the 1990s.</i>

04:02.009 --> 04:05.877
<i>  He distributed risk</i>
<i>  by operating a fleet</i>
<i>  of small teams,</i>

04:05.879 --> 04:07.846
<i>  in multiple locations.</i>

04:07.848 --> 04:10.716
<i>  Each running</i>
<i>  several submarine stills,</i>

04:10.718 --> 04:12.918
<i>  and delivering</i>
<i>  the product back to it.</i>

04:12.920 --> 04:15.854
<i>  That way,</i>
<i>  if one site got raided,</i>

04:15.856 --> 04:18.123
<i>  it didn't disrupt</i>
<i>  the whole operation.</i>

04:18.792 --> 04:19.791
Our first run,

04:19.793 --> 04:23.395
we got run in on,
and lost everything.

04:23.397 --> 04:26.231
So, we're gonna divide up,
our big still site,

04:26.233 --> 04:28.533
and we're just gonna
conquer this season.

04:28.535 --> 04:31.837
Josh is taking two stills,
down to north carolina,
with him.

04:31.839 --> 04:34.773
-David.
-Henry, how are
you doing, mate?

04:34.775 --> 04:36.675
<i> [tickle] henry called</i>
<i>  old buddy, david.</i>

04:36.677 --> 04:38.277
He's old moonshiner
from the past.

04:38.279 --> 04:40.245
He's going to run
two of them for us.

04:40.247 --> 04:43.015
And then, we're gonna
keep running on
the four big ones,

04:43.017 --> 04:43.815
that we got.

04:43.817 --> 04:44.816
And that right there,

04:44.818 --> 04:47.586
that ought to really put us,
over the top.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.087
-Looks like
the old days, ain't?
-Yeah.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.856
-Here, got them stretched out.
-Yeah.

04:50.858 --> 04:51.823
Brings back old memories.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.892
-Some good, some bad.
-Exactly.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.128
So, we got two of them,
josh got two of them.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.062
We downsizing this forward.

04:57.064 --> 04:57.729
Okay.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.898
<i> David, he's a hell of a worker</i>

04:59.900 --> 05:02.401
he pulled time,
three or four times,
for making liquor.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.669
He knows what he's doing.

05:03.671 --> 05:04.836
Take it across there.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.172
The best part of it all,
he's reliable,

05:07.174 --> 05:08.674
and he keeps his mouth shut.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.008
-We got one ready to load up.
-All right.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.843
-You checked your
rearview mirror?
-Yeah.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.646
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, most definitely.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.315
I'm just now meeting david,

05:16.317 --> 05:17.949
but henry,
and kenny assure me,

05:17.951 --> 05:22.020
that he's a moonshiner,
that they've known
from way back in the day.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.422
<i>  That's all I need to hear.</i>

05:23.424 --> 05:24.723
All right, easy.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.425
[tickle] now,
we gotta find, david,

05:26.427 --> 05:28.493
a place, to set up
a new still site.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.163
-Hey, david,
you following them?
-[david] yes, sir.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.105
I think, I found
a good location
for these two subs

05:40.674 --> 05:41.873
<i>  a buddy of mine, owns a land.</i>

05:41.875 --> 05:44.042
Should be fairly safe. But--

05:44.044 --> 05:45.844
david's gonna be there,
by himself.

05:45.846 --> 05:46.378
Come on here, david.

05:48.082 --> 05:48.714
Yeah, man.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.716
That can be good water down.

05:50.718 --> 05:53.685
We come up here,
to the still site, that
henry wants to show us.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.687
This thing is looking good.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.722
-It's ice cold.
-Ice cold.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.757
<i> [tickle] there's a beautiful</i>
<i>  creek, here.</i>

05:58.759 --> 06:00.625
<i>  There's plenty of water,</i>
<i>  flowing through it.</i>

06:00.627 --> 06:03.128
This still site,
it will work just fine.

06:03.130 --> 06:06.264
David, who you think
about here,
with you running by yourself.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.666
You know, normally,

06:07.768 --> 06:10.502
-we start from
the side of this creek.
-Right. Water.

06:10.504 --> 06:13.572
Where we turn it,
the burners around,
fired from this side.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.607
Mmm-hmm,
and put your thump
over on the side.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.776
-Water box over, here.
-Good, right here.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.911
One man can see
the whole operation.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.546
And not have to worry
about nothing.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.581
All right,
that's the plan then.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.316
-Start digging the main boil.
-All right.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.719
<i> [henry] we've decided,</i>
<i>  when he runs the subs,</i>

06:27.721 --> 06:29.121
<i>  he's gonna bring out</i>
<i>  the liquor,</i>

06:29.123 --> 06:30.455
<i>  leave it at a drop site.</i>

06:30.457 --> 06:31.556
We're gonna come in,

06:31.558 --> 06:34.693
bring the sugar, propane,
to put in for the next run.

06:34.695 --> 06:35.861
<i>  And then we're gonna</i>
<i>  pick up the liquor.</i>

06:35.863 --> 06:38.697
<i>  We'll give, david, a third.</i>

06:38.699 --> 06:40.599
When he's done with it,
we'll pay him the money.

06:40.601 --> 06:41.600
And everybody's happy.

06:41.602 --> 06:42.934
Well, one more thing,
a little high-tech.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.069
-We want to show you.
-All right.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.771
We'll set this up
here, somewhere.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.806
And it give us a real time.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.408
-Anything moves in here,
it'll call us on it.
-All right.

06:49.410 --> 06:50.342
On our phones.

06:50.344 --> 06:51.743
And we'll know exactly,
who's in here.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.412
-We'll be able to look at it,
right on the phone, man.
-All right.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.680
-Well--
-now, with that said,

06:55.682 --> 06:57.783
you got to remember,
to turn it off,
when you come in here.

06:57.785 --> 06:58.750
-Yeah. All right.
-If not--

06:58.752 --> 07:00.685
-they will have hours
of you taped.
-Yeah.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.421
-Okay.
-And then, they won't even
have to chase you.

07:02.423 --> 07:03.789
-They'll have you.
-They'll have me.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.424
-[laughing]
-okay.

07:05.426 --> 07:08.026
Everything has
moved ahead
with the times.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.462
<i>  And moonshine</i>
<i>  has followed suit.</i>

07:10.464 --> 07:12.531
And now we've
got this trail cam.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.834
I'll be dogged if anybody's
going to get in here,
without us knowing.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.869
Look like,
it's getting about time to
mash in, ain't it?

07:17.871 --> 07:18.937
I'm ready.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.383
Welcome to paradise.

07:31.385 --> 07:33.785
All right. Now,
the hard part begins.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.788
<i> [narrator] down south</i>
<i>  of new iberia, louisiana,</i>

07:36.790 --> 07:40.492

<i>  are breaking out</i>
<i>  the big guns.</i>

07:40.494 --> 07:43.628
<i>  Setting up their 200 gallon</i>
<i>  submarine pot,</i>

07:43.630 --> 07:46.431
<i>  for a tenfold increase</i>
<i>  in their productions,</i>

07:46.433 --> 07:48.567
<i>  of absinthe,</i>
<i>  for a big city buyer.</i>

07:48.569 --> 07:49.534
We're building decks.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.736
We got all this money,
invested in this copper.

07:51.738 --> 07:55.106
This is a much larger run
that the first absinthe run,
we did.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.942
This guy, he really liked
this absinthe we made.

07:56.944 --> 07:59.110
So, we're gonna
run it on the big still.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.512
We have enough
to fill this order,

08:00.514 --> 08:01.813
and have some for ourselves.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.849
We can, you know,
start some new clientele,
with this.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.951
Hopefully, everything
works out well.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.953
<i>  Copper's real shiny,</i>
<i>  on this still.</i>

08:07.955 --> 08:10.355
We gotta camouflage
this thing, immediately.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.593
Welcome to louisiana.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.328
We gonna make sure,
it's understood,

08:16.997 --> 08:19.064
you come up in here,
you're trespassing.

08:19.766 --> 08:20.699
[craig] you got your knife?

08:20.701 --> 08:22.000
[richard] do I have a knife?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.401
We're from new iberia, man.

08:23.403 --> 08:24.569
Everybody got a knife.

08:24.571 --> 08:26.071
Yeah, I think,
it's looking pretty good.

08:26.406 --> 08:27.873
<i>  You shouldn't be</i>
<i>  able to see anything,</i>
<i>  when you're on the bayou.</i>

08:27.875 --> 08:29.574
I'm excited to get
the still out here.

08:29.576 --> 08:32.010
<i>  The hard part is now,</i>
<i> we gotta scale up our recipes.</i>

08:32.012 --> 08:34.112
We're used to doing things
on a smaller scale,

08:34.114 --> 08:35.914
but this is a big order.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.015
That's perfect.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.383
That's just enough
room under there,
for our burners.

08:38.385 --> 08:39.818
<i>  If this run works out,</i>

08:39.820 --> 08:42.020
<i>  I mean, we could be getting</i>
<i>  in the bigger sales,</i>
<i>  new sales.</i>

08:42.022 --> 08:44.923
New orleans is a city,
that has a lot of money.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.625
Let me see that burner.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.627
We'll be ready
to go in a second.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.128
The clock's ticking
on this one, now.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.163
Now, that we got
our still site setup,

08:52.165 --> 08:53.565
we'll run our sugar wash.

08:53.567 --> 08:56.001
As I noticed
this mash is working.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.137
A perfect,
base purified absinthe.

08:59.406 --> 09:00.639
All right, let's go you ready?

09:02.142 --> 09:04.075
<i> [richard] this is one of the</i>
<i>  biggest runs, we've done.</i>

09:05.546 --> 09:06.411
Woohoo.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.847
Going from 20 gallons
to 200 gallons.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.081
That's a tenfold increase.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.583
With that comes,

09:11.585 --> 09:13.051
increased profits definitely,

09:13.053 --> 09:15.420
with absinthe is
a crazy complicated drink.

09:15.622 --> 09:17.422
We're cooking, baby.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.391
We're gonna try
to stay as close to
the original recipe,

09:19.393 --> 09:21.126
that we have, as possible.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.828
<i>  There is no room for failure.</i>
<i>  We have to get this right.</i>

09:23.830 --> 09:25.697
Look at the steam
coming off of that.

09:25.699 --> 09:26.865
Yeah, starting to
really come, now.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.434
Man, this thing hot, man.

09:29.436 --> 09:30.735
Hopefully, by the time
we finish running this,

09:30.737 --> 09:32.904
we'll have enough to sell,
enough to keep for us.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.739
And it could
spread the word
about absinthe.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.208
A good racoon died
for the sake of us
making good liquor.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.443
I'm sorry, old fellow.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.845
It's something that
coming back now and--

09:40.847 --> 09:42.380
hopefully, we can be
in front of the market,
with it.

09:42.716 --> 09:43.982
There we go.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.551
Man, we gonna get out
of here, before dark,
it's look like.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.954
Now we got to deal
with this maceration, man.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.890
I think, that's enough
of the head, right down.
We'll take that off.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.892
<i>  This is the easy part</i>
<i>  of the process.</i>

09:53.894 --> 09:55.393
The hard part is maceration,

09:55.395 --> 09:56.995
and putting all these
herbs and botanicals in.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.731
And getting it right,
where it'll be palatable.

09:59.733 --> 10:00.865
I got everything
already measured out,

10:00.867 --> 10:02.100
like we needed it to be.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.002
<i>  I have a recipe</i>
<i>  we did last time.</i>

10:04.004 --> 10:06.972
We scaled up five times
the amount of ingredients,

10:06.974 --> 10:08.006
that we used last time.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.140
Star anise.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.909
Gonna have anise,
anise tea, fennel.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.477
Gotta have wormwood.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.613
Throw them in the bucket.
Shake them up real well.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.382
<i>  We'll come back tomorrow,</i>
<i>  and we're gonna</i>
<i>  run that again.</i>

10:17.384 --> 10:18.917
And turn that into
our white absinthe.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.285
Let's get out of here.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.667
<i> [mark] on our way</i>
<i>  to the beach.</i>

10:35.669 --> 10:37.836
Pick up our sea-aged liquor.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.871
Damn. I hope
it's done something
worthwhile.

10:39.873 --> 10:40.839
Six months ago,

10:40.841 --> 10:43.875
we put a 100 gallons
of our tennessee whiskey,

10:43.877 --> 10:47.312
on our friend,
shorty shrimp's boat,
to rapid age it.

10:47.314 --> 10:50.048
You know, we gotta
compensate
shorty a little bit

10:50.050 --> 10:52.984
-give him a gallon of the
liquor and a thousand bucks?
-Yeah.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.819
We promised beaz,

10:54.821 --> 10:57.589
a 100 gallons, rapid aged,
on the sea,

10:57.591 --> 11:00.692
five-year-old liquor,
the equivalent of.

11:00.694 --> 11:04.763
Kind of concerned about
we go pick it up,
if it worked.

11:04.765 --> 11:05.964
We got a lot riding on this.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.733
It's a $22,500 payday,

11:08.735 --> 11:09.734
and we've never done this.

11:09.736 --> 11:12.737
We don't know,
if it'll work or not.

11:12.739 --> 11:14.873
-What's up?
Well, look who it is.
-Captain.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.808
Good to see y'all. As always.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.411
Just got these bad boys
unloaded this morning.

11:19.413 --> 11:22.847
Back in here,
it's a little dock
and sure enough.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.582
There is two
barrels of liquor,

11:24.584 --> 11:25.884
sitting under some
shrimping nets.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.820
This was a long
six months for us, shorty.

11:28.822 --> 11:31.222
We can't wait to see,
what it tastes like.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.161
[shorty] good to see y'all.
As always.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.563
<i> [digger] we roll up</i>
<i>  to shorty's dock.</i>

11:38.565 --> 11:41.433
Hid under some
shrimp net, is our liquor.

11:41.435 --> 11:42.500
Coast guard,
gave me a little scare.

11:42.502 --> 11:45.637
-Oh, really?
-Hey boy, how'd you
get out of that?

11:45.639 --> 11:48.406
I just told them,
I was using that for balance,
on either side of the boat.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.974
That's what I like about you,

11:49.976 --> 11:51.876
you do business the right way,
thinking on your feet.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.645
I tell you what
we're gonna have to do.

11:53.647 --> 11:55.747
We have to siphon it out.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.649
So, we'll get one of them
on up on the truck,

11:57.651 --> 11:58.983
and we'll see what we got.

11:59.352 --> 12:02.987
Shorty has been babysitting,
these two barrels,
for six months.

12:02.989 --> 12:06.725
I think that he's
looking forward to having
amount of his possession.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.093
-[digger grunts] it's coming.
-Easy.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.128
-[digger] lucky arm.
-[mark] there she blows.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.630
Oh, damn.

12:12.632 --> 12:14.566
Damn, shorty,
look what you've done.

12:14.568 --> 12:15.834
Oh, that's what
heaven smells like.

12:15.836 --> 12:18.403
Phew. Damn.
That's something else.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.938
Right here,
is where the rubber
meets the road.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.773
<i> We'll sap it a little bit out.</i>

12:21.775 --> 12:23.908
<i>  Get in a jug,</i>
<i>  give her a taste.</i>

12:23.910 --> 12:26.644
[mark] oh my,
look at that first.

12:26.646 --> 12:29.948
The bung smell great,
on the barrel.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.683
So, we know that
the nose is there.

12:31.685 --> 12:32.717
We're nervous.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.152
You know,
if this is not good liquor,

12:34.154 --> 12:36.354
we will not
put it on to a client.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.959
Holly moly.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.294
That all big in the wild.

12:43.897 --> 12:44.729
We taste right out of the jug.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.765
You've got strong vanilla.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.167
You've got a light cinnamon.
You've got a little leather.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.669
Man, that is super,
super good.

12:51.671 --> 12:52.804
Look at that.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.272
It's that deep mahogany color.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.274
It's just deep rich browns.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.109
So, it's phenomenal.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.078
Heck, yeah.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.714
Goodness.
I'd say that's it, fellas.

13:02.716 --> 13:03.748
We want you to have that.

13:03.750 --> 13:06.785
We want to settle up with you,
with some cash too.

13:06.787 --> 13:09.654
We was thinking, that jug,
and maybe a thousand bucks.

13:09.656 --> 13:10.889
I'm not even really
interested in the cash.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.024
I'm more interested
in more of these.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.994
-We should never
let you had a taste. [laughs]
-what are you thinking about?

13:16.396 --> 13:17.495
I'm thinking, six.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.097
[mark] what do you think?

13:19.099 --> 13:21.099
I mean without him,
without shorty,
we wouldn't had it.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.400
[digger] I'm good with six.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.902
Six suits you, no cash?

13:23.904 --> 13:24.869
[shorty] no cash.

13:24.871 --> 13:27.272
We both agree on six gallons.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.173
<i> [mark] well, sadly,</i>

13:28.175 --> 13:30.408
<i>  we have less than</i>
<i>  a 100 gallons, now.</i>

13:30.410 --> 13:34.579
<i>  We lost maybe,</i>
<i>  five gallons to leakage,</i>
<i>  to the broken bunk.</i>

13:34.581 --> 13:36.281
When we put it
on the boat, initially.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.983
<i>  Now, that's ten percent</i>
<i>  of what we brought.</i>

13:38.985 --> 13:43.655
And, you know, that kind of
puts me and, digger,
in a little bit of a bind.

13:43.657 --> 13:49.828
This was an experiment
that succeeded,
past our expectation.

13:49.830 --> 13:50.762
Care if we do
a couple more of these?

13:50.764 --> 13:52.797
Maybe six.

13:52.799 --> 13:54.766
Six could be a lot,
that could be pushing my luck.

13:54.768 --> 13:56.601
There's no doubt in my mind,

13:56.603 --> 14:00.038
that this needs to be
in our quiver of
how we age some liquor.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.841
Two was a big
enough risk, as it was.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.910
But two ain't worth
our time and money,
coming over here.

14:05.912 --> 14:06.911
How about four?

14:06.947 --> 14:08.012
[shorty] no.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.447
[digger] so, you're saying no.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.015
-Yes, sir. I don't think
that's gonna work.
-Yeah, but, there's a maybe.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.350
[chuckles]

14:12.352 --> 14:13.785
not ain't even
a definite maybe?

14:13.787 --> 14:15.687
Not even a definite maybe

14:15.689 --> 14:17.422
you know, sea-aging
worked so good for us,

14:17.424 --> 14:19.057
on this limited run, here.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.659
<i>  That we want to continue</i>
<i>  doing it on a bigger scale.</i>

14:21.661 --> 14:22.760
We're open to ideas.

14:22.762 --> 14:27.532
Maybe another way
of creating the same effect,

14:27.534 --> 14:28.733
you know, we thought about.
We don't know yet.

14:28.735 --> 14:31.669
Moderation. Moderation.
Moderation.

14:31.671 --> 14:34.005
-...Moderation.
-That's exactly right.
Especially with that.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.874
Y'all be good. Be safe man.

14:35.876 --> 14:36.708
[digger] all right, brother.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.978
[mark] tell you,
I couldn't be happier

14:39.980 --> 14:42.213
with the way,
that liquor turned out.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.264
[henry] I got my
cold storage back here.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.332
[tickle] they just
gotta roll it in,

15:01.334 --> 15:02.400
that's when I get happy

15:02.402 --> 15:03.401
[henry] that's it.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.736
[tickle] henry got a call,

15:04.738 --> 15:07.939
and somebody
needed to get rid
of a lot of peaches.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.140
<i> We gotta do everything we can,</i>

15:09.142 --> 15:10.775
<i>  to make it back on top.</i>

15:10.777 --> 15:11.943
<i>  Because right now,</i>
<i>  we're scrambling.</i>

15:11.945 --> 15:12.944
[henry] they look good.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.812
[tickle] oh, yes, sir.
They look good.

15:14.814 --> 15:18.616
And so, this couldn't
fell into our laps,
at a better time.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.953
The laws
they are known,
for their peach brandy.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.922
We can make quick work
of this, right here.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.890
And in little bit of time,

15:25.892 --> 15:27.292
we'll have some good,
high dollar liquor.

15:28.628 --> 15:31.095
<i>  We had a real</i>
<i>  rough start to this season.</i>

15:31.097 --> 15:32.630
Our very first run this year,

15:32.632 --> 15:34.499
we got run in on.

15:34.501 --> 15:38.169
So, we've really got to get
this operation in full swing.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.771
If we don't make liquor,
we don't make money.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.073
Well, most little too soft.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.808
Oh, actually, all right.
That means,
they're good and ready.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.743
-Amazing, ready then--
-yes, sir.

15:45.745 --> 15:46.744
What you gotta
remember now, paige.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.413
A lot of times,
you pick them up,

15:48.415 --> 15:49.647
from an orchard,
they'll be a little too hard.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.449
You gotta wait for
them to soften up.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.484
-If you want that juice,
out from them.
-Yeah.

15:53.486 --> 15:56.054
And you can't beat them up,
if they're too hard.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.823
-We're just gonna
mash them up in that masher.
-Yeah.

15:58.825 --> 15:59.924
We'll try.

15:59.926 --> 16:00.992
We let this down,
with his teeth on it,
right here.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.927
It's gonna mash
the peaches with force.

16:02.929 --> 16:04.095
We'll be able to grab this.

16:04.764 --> 16:05.330
Pull it up.

16:05.899 --> 16:07.031
Dump it right in.

16:07.033 --> 16:08.166
55 gallon barrel.

16:09.936 --> 16:11.302
Drop it back,
throw another bushel in.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.403
Bam!

16:13.907 --> 16:15.206
-[tickle] just keep going.
-Keep on going with it.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.407
Here we go.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.209
Josh built this machine,

16:18.211 --> 16:21.245
and it's basically,
a fruit smasher.

16:21.247 --> 16:22.380
See what you got.

16:23.984 --> 16:24.949
This thing,

16:24.951 --> 16:28.119
boy, it does what
it sets out to do.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.854
Let's spin around,
a little bit.

16:29.856 --> 16:34.425
<i> [tickle] on a normal day,</i>
<i>  if we was to beat in</i>
<i>  this many peaches by hand,</i>

16:34.427 --> 16:36.828
<i>  it would be an all-day job.</i>

16:36.830 --> 16:38.096
Oh, yeah.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.230
Got it done in what?

16:39.799 --> 16:40.465
Seconds.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.399
-[chuckles] seconds.
-Seconds.

16:43.903 --> 16:44.702
<i>  This plan,</i>

16:44.704 --> 16:47.071
<i>  boy it really cut</i>
<i>  the time down,</i>

16:47.073 --> 16:49.273
<i>  to really matter of hours.</i>

16:50.110 --> 16:51.409
Oh, yeah.

16:51.411 --> 16:52.910
This fruit smasher

16:52.912 --> 16:55.980
it's shooting peaches,
everywhere.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.749
<i>  It is really messy.</i>

16:57.751 --> 16:59.784
<i>  But I ain't gonna lie to you.</i>

16:59.786 --> 17:01.719
If I had to beat
these things in by hand,

17:01.721 --> 17:03.388
I'd eventually
got this dirty.

17:03.390 --> 17:05.323
It'd just took me
all day to do it.

17:05.725 --> 17:06.457
Look it, yonder.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.626
That'll do, right there.
Won't it?

17:08.628 --> 17:10.962
That ain't tore up,
I don't know what is.

17:10.964 --> 17:12.997
[kenny] all right,
get us some water, tickle.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.600
We got these
peaches mashed in.

17:15.602 --> 17:16.701
<i>  David's calling.</i>

17:16.703 --> 17:18.936
He's ready for us,
to pick a load of liquor up.

17:18.938 --> 17:21.372
And bring him,
some more supplies,
down there.

17:30.650 --> 17:31.649
<i> [richard] we got the fountain,</i>

17:31.651 --> 17:33.451
<i>  to make sure</i>
<i>  it does lose right.</i>

17:33.453 --> 17:35.686
<i>  Craig and I</i>
<i>  are at the still site.</i>

17:35.688 --> 17:39.023
<i>  We have 15 gallons of</i>
<i>  high-proof macerated,</i>
<i>  base spirit.</i>

17:39.125 --> 17:40.224
Oh, yeah, it's green.

17:40.727 --> 17:41.559
Wooh, it's strong.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.827
We're gonna run
our white absinthe.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.596
[craig] all right,
I'm start handing
these buckets off to you.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.532
We've invested
a whole lot of money,
into this run.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.434
We put a whole lot of money,
into this deck.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.836
We put a whole lot of money,
in securing the spot.

17:51.838 --> 17:55.640
This is a real, real
complicated drink,
that we put together, here.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.909
Oh, yeah, it smells so good.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.310
Everything is on
the line, here.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.645
Everything!

18:01.047 --> 18:03.047
We're gonna put
55 gallons of water
in here, also.

18:03.083 --> 18:03.714
Oh, yeah.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.817
-Ready?
-Come on.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.919
Down side of throwing
all these botanicals
in the pot,

18:07.921 --> 18:09.287
is you can scorch
the bottom of the pot.

18:09.956 --> 18:10.822
That's it.

18:10.824 --> 18:12.223
You gotta stir it, now.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.559
This ain't no crawfish pot.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.494
<i>  Gonna take a little while</i>
<i>  to get this heated up.</i>

18:16.496 --> 18:18.796
<i>  Its gonna start</i>
<i>  to roll on its own.</i>

18:18.798 --> 18:20.898
<i>  We don't have to worry</i>
<i>  about anything sticking.</i>

18:20.900 --> 18:23.000
You got to make sure
that you stir it.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.669
So, nothing settles
at the bottom.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.804
And when this thing
starts to boil,

18:26.806 --> 18:30.308
<i>  convectional heat kick in,</i>
<i>  and it'll roll around.</i>

18:30.310 --> 18:31.109
With lot of wood going in it,

18:31.111 --> 18:33.077
actually started
to steam good.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.012
Just starting to roll.

18:35.648 --> 18:36.747
We gonna go ahead,
and cabinet.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.316
Because right now,
it's ready to go.

18:39.586 --> 18:40.551
Make sure,
that's in there good.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.653
Absinthe has
this mystique to it.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.056
<i>  It's probably way more potent</i>
<i>  back in the day,</i>
<i>  then it is now.</i>

18:45.058 --> 18:47.658
And I think,
that's why my connect
is coming to me.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.760
He wants to get something,

18:49.762 --> 18:52.964
true and consistent,
to a real recipe.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.966
Oh man, still is hot.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.735
Yeah, we hot down
into the thumper.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.271
And that's what
we're gonna give him,
a true absinthe.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.075
Now, we're flowing good.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.145
And here, it's gotta go.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.414
That's a nice drip
she got right there.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.956
Taste a little different,
than last time.

19:20.126 --> 19:21.959
-How so?
-I don't know, but this--

19:22.529 --> 19:23.861
I don't know.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.363
Come on, man.
Don't tell me that [bleeps]

19:27.734 --> 19:29.066
we got a problem.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.475
<i> [mark] we've sure</i>
<i>  spent a lot of time</i>
<i>  on this damn liquor.</i>

19:37.477 --> 19:39.844
<i>  From the time we made it</i>
<i>  to where all we hauled it.</i>

19:39.846 --> 19:42.914
We made it back from
the east coast
of north carolina.

19:42.916 --> 19:45.750
Got all our barrels picked up,
and now we're back.

19:45.752 --> 19:48.753
We're gonna outfit beaz
with some of the finest,

19:48.755 --> 19:51.055
sea-aged
tennessee whiskey,
ever seen.

19:51.157 --> 19:51.756
[mark] killer.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.324
[digger] beaz.

19:53.326 --> 19:55.793
That was fun,
running up them stairs,
just then.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.061
[mark] you look almost 60.

19:57.063 --> 19:58.029
You needed to.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.430
[chuckles] I did need to.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.498
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey, man.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.400
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you, man.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.936
Man, when it comes to
upper end clients,

20:04.938 --> 20:06.804
beaz is the guy.

20:06.806 --> 20:10.074
He's connected with
the music industry,
deep in nashville.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.275
Look at this.

20:11.611 --> 20:12.476
Holy cow.

20:12.478 --> 20:16.180
And that also
gives us a chance to,

20:16.182 --> 20:19.050
sell a little bit of liquor
at a little more of a premium.

20:19.085 --> 20:19.884
Wow!

20:19.886 --> 20:20.885
Look at that.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.120
And you did that
in like, six months?

20:23.122 --> 20:24.622
-Six months.
-Six months.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.423
Can I taste it?

20:25.425 --> 20:27.024
-Well, yeah.
-We recommend it.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.626
Look how pretty that is.
Ain't that a good liquor?

20:28.628 --> 20:30.094
That is gorgeous.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.064
-[digger] what a nose,
it's got.
-Wow.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.101
[digger] easy, now.

20:37.103 --> 20:39.237
-[mark] who in the world
would have thought--
-[exclaims]

20:39.239 --> 20:40.605
they are gonna love that.

20:40.607 --> 20:45.409
The flavor profile is
right in line with
the five-year-old liquor.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.745
You got your tobacco's.
You got your cinnamon.
You got your vanilla.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.047
It's all across the palate,
for your nose.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.583
I'm as proud of that as any as
we've ever done.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.418
-[digger] yeah.
-Oh, my gosh.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.587
They're gonna be
out of their gourd.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.923
-Sea-aged, tennessee whiskey.
-Yeah.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.825
And this is the first time
you've done this.

21:00.827 --> 21:01.959
[digger] oh, yeah.

21:01.961 --> 21:05.730
Now, just a little bit
of update.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.064
We had a little accident.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.900
We had a busted bunk,
that leaked out.

21:09.902 --> 21:13.804
And we had to give
the boat captain six gallons,

21:13.806 --> 21:17.708
for his role in this
sea-aging process.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.844
I mean, honestly,
your takeaway here,

21:19.846 --> 21:21.312
is gonna be about 90 gallons.

21:21.648 --> 21:22.480
Wow.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.781
I mean, this ain't
our first rodeo,

21:23.783 --> 21:26.684
-and we still make
common boo-boos too.
-Gotcha.

21:26.686 --> 21:29.420
-Nothing is ever.
If you need 100 gallons.
-Gotcha.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.856
You don't just
take a 100 gallons.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.024
I get that.

21:33.026 --> 21:34.392
All righty, so--

21:34.394 --> 21:35.993
so, is this it?
Let's load it up.

21:35.995 --> 21:36.761
It is not.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.029
It's still in the barrels.

21:38.031 --> 21:39.430
Ready for you,
to put it in the jars.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.365
Wait a minute.

21:43.936 --> 21:47.004
Did I not tell you
that they wanted bottles?

21:47.006 --> 21:48.139
You did not.

21:48.608 --> 21:49.874
We gotta have bottles.

21:49.876 --> 21:52.376
This is a well-known
arena act.

21:52.378 --> 21:54.645
Their tour bus is tricked out.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.580
-And they don't want--
-I don't give a damn,
who they are.

21:56.582 --> 22:00.217
-We don't have bottles.
-They don't want jars,
on there--

22:01.454 --> 22:04.055
you know, these guys
spend a fortune,
on their bars.

22:04.057 --> 22:06.524
So, I'm sure
they just don't want
a lonely mason jar,

22:06.526 --> 22:08.826
that looks like,
they dip something
out of a bucket.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.429
Do you know,
how hard glass is
to get right now?

22:11.431 --> 22:12.830
No matter what it is.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.566
There's legal distilleries,
can't get bottles right now.

22:15.568 --> 22:16.701
Bottles are more expensive.

22:16.703 --> 22:21.539
If digger and myself,
can even find bottles,

22:21.541 --> 22:23.908
that's on you,
because you gotta
pay for that.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.544
It's gonna be
a tough find beaz.
I mean that's--

22:26.546 --> 22:29.213
it was just an oversight,
not telling you that.

22:29.215 --> 22:31.482
-You gotta bring the stuff to
the table immediately, beaz.
-Dang.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.084
All right.

22:33.086 --> 22:35.186
[mark] we'll start,
what we know,
to start for bottles.

22:46.566 --> 22:50.134
Let's do a loose test.
See what's going on
with this white absinthe, man.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.838
So, we ran our
white absinthe
and something's off here.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.107
I'm missing something,
that's mystery.

22:56.409 --> 22:57.775
Just want some drops.

22:57.777 --> 23:00.978
[craig] yeah.
I see all the oils,
just dancing around.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.713
We're gonna do
a loose on this.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.049
And we're gonna taste this,
like it's supposed to
be tasted.

23:05.852 --> 23:06.717
<i>  Where you take cold water,</i>

23:06.719 --> 23:08.919
<i>  and pour it into this,</i>
<i>  very slowly.</i>

23:08.921 --> 23:12.623
<i>  The oils separate,</i>
<i>  and starts to</i>
<i>  present themselves.</i>

23:12.625 --> 23:14.225
That's how
it's supposed to look.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.395
<i> [richard] the oils</i>
<i>  are starting to release.</i>

23:17.397 --> 23:19.663
It looks like a proper loose.

23:19.665 --> 23:21.399
I'm hoping
some of these flavors
that we're missing,

23:21.401 --> 23:23.000
are gonna present themselves.

23:26.439 --> 23:28.839
Something's just not
quite right, man.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.708
These flavors are not
balancing themselves,
together.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.777
They're not marrying well.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.278
I don't know,
if I want to give this
into that--

23:34.280 --> 23:35.713
our guy, man.

23:35.715 --> 23:36.881
<i>  This guy,</i>
<i>  that we're dealing with</i>
<i>  in new orleans.</i>

23:36.883 --> 23:39.016
He knows,
what absinthe taste like.

23:39.018 --> 23:41.452
So, I'm scared to
present this
to this guy.

23:41.454 --> 23:42.820
He'll tell me,

23:42.822 --> 23:44.755
"man you did
something, last time,
that you can't do again."

23:44.757 --> 23:47.691
maybe it was scaling up,
such a big run.

23:47.693 --> 23:51.028
Maybe we scaled up too high,
on some of the botanicals.

23:51.030 --> 23:53.130
I'm definitely tasting
more wormwood.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.999
It's there. Big time.

23:55.001 --> 23:55.800
It's present.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.101
Mmm-hmm.

23:57.470 --> 23:59.069
When we scaled up this recipe,

23:59.071 --> 24:00.404
we didn't take into
consideration the fact,

24:00.406 --> 24:03.374
that wormwood is
real powerful.
It's overpowering.

24:03.776 --> 24:04.842
400 grams.

24:04.844 --> 24:07.678
<i>  -That's a lot.</i>
<i>  -That's 14 ounces.</i>

24:07.680 --> 24:09.847
Maybe we could have
cut back on some of that.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.015
[craig] that's
a rookie mistake.

24:11.017 --> 24:12.016
I ain't no rookie.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.819
We can just dump all of it,

24:14.821 --> 24:15.519
or we put it
back into the still,

24:15.521 --> 24:17.421
run it again.

24:17.423 --> 24:20.191
Try to bring it back to
as close to its original
recipe as possible.

24:20.393 --> 24:21.459
Lemon balm.

24:21.594 --> 24:23.861
The citrus flavor in it,
cuts back on that wormwood.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.596
That's why,
it's so potent in there.

24:25.598 --> 24:26.797
<i>  Wormwood is so bitter.</i>

24:26.799 --> 24:28.666
<i>  Lemon balm,</i>
<i>  helps calm it down.</i>

24:28.668 --> 24:30.768
<i>  Help to tame it,</i>
<i>  with this citrusy flavor.</i>

24:30.770 --> 24:32.636
You have to have
a perfect balance of this.

24:32.638 --> 24:35.940
We're gonna re-run it
and we gonna double up,
on lemon balm.

24:35.942 --> 24:39.009
We'll go ahead,
and mash back in,
and start over, man.

24:40.413 --> 24:41.645
<i>  This liquor,</i>
<i>  ain't gonna go to waste.</i>

24:41.647 --> 24:44.148
We're going to
put it back in there,
run it again.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.883
And again and again
until we get it right.

24:45.885 --> 24:48.252
Got so much money
tied up in this, man.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.221
Between the deck
and the botanicals.

24:50.223 --> 24:52.189
Man, we gotta get
this run right, man.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.124
Let's go.

24:55.428 --> 24:56.861
Take that long trip.

25:08.975 --> 25:12.042
[tickle] alright now, he said
he's gonna be somewhere
around here.

25:13.679 --> 25:14.678
After this raid,

25:14.680 --> 25:18.082
we're being as cautious
as we possibly can be.

25:18.084 --> 25:21.018
<i>  We're not even gonna</i>
<i>  meet up with</i>
<i>  david in person.</i>

25:21.020 --> 25:22.353
Right here. This way in.

25:22.355 --> 25:22.820
All right, down in here.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.922
This old road bed.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.423
<i> [tickle] david,</i>
<i>  give us a call,</i>
<i>  and he said,</i>

25:26.425 --> 25:28.926
<i>  he's got a great spot</i>
<i>  picked out.</i>

25:28.928 --> 25:31.328
He's gonna park his truck,
full of liquor, right under.

25:32.398 --> 25:34.331
-[henry] oh, man.
-[tickle] here you go.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.834
<i>  And we're gonna bring,</i>
<i>  our truck in.</i>

25:36.836 --> 25:39.770
That's got
the mash ingredients,
and the propane he needs.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.472
And we're just gonna
swap trucks out.

25:41.474 --> 25:42.706
[kenny] that there
looks darn good.

25:42.708 --> 25:47.711
David has got
a really nice run up
some mighty fine liquor.

25:47.713 --> 25:52.316
It looks like
this operation is really
gonna work good for us.

25:52.318 --> 25:54.485
Tickle you take this truck,
you and kenny back it out.

25:54.487 --> 25:56.887
Leave the other vehicle,
with the sugar,
and the tanks in it.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.189
We really need to
get out of here
before the storm hits.

25:59.191 --> 26:00.491
You got that right.

26:00.493 --> 26:02.092
[grunts]

26:02.094 --> 26:04.662
<i> [tickle] you know,</i>
<i>  we're busy with</i>
<i>  our own four pots.</i>

26:04.664 --> 26:06.864
David is busy with his two.

26:06.866 --> 26:10.434
<i>  We're running,</i>
<i>  two of the stills in</i>
<i>  north carolina with josh.</i>

26:10.436 --> 26:11.835
We really gonna have to
keep it going,

26:11.837 --> 26:14.605
to get ourselves
out of this hole,
we got ourself in.

26:14.607 --> 26:16.740
<i> [henry] sizing down the way</i>
<i>  we're sizing down.</i>

26:16.742 --> 26:18.142
<i>  It's gonna make it</i>
<i>  a whole lot easier.</i>

26:18.144 --> 26:19.643
<i>  We're making money.</i>

26:19.645 --> 26:20.978
Man, finally,
things are looking up.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.246
What you think
about it, tickle?

26:22.248 --> 26:23.948
I think it's a damn
good stash site.

26:23.950 --> 26:26.817
Look we got
a secret passageway,
going into it.

26:26.819 --> 26:28.819
Nobody ever know
the doors here.

26:28.821 --> 26:31.088
<i> [tickle] we get here,</i>
<i>  to our stash house.</i>

26:31.090 --> 26:33.791
This is a perfect
place for this.

26:33.793 --> 26:34.391
Let's do it.

26:36.729 --> 26:37.995
Ain't she pretty?

26:40.600 --> 26:42.933
It was a rough old hole
to get into,

26:42.935 --> 26:44.602
but I think
it's gonna be safe.

26:44.604 --> 26:46.036
I think so, too.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.505
-[henry] right here.
-[tickle] good deal.

26:48.507 --> 26:51.108
But look, we got us some
nice dry storage bomb.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.910
But what are we doing
with this stuff, now?

26:52.912 --> 26:56.780
The plan is now,
we got a truckload
of damsons, man.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.382
It's like a plum.

26:58.384 --> 26:59.950
Used to grow in
the mountains,
around here a lot.

26:59.952 --> 27:03.220
The blight or something,
supposed hit 'em,
killed most of them out.

27:03.222 --> 27:04.421
We'll mash them in,
right here.

27:04.423 --> 27:05.789
We want to take
one gallon of this liquor,

27:05.791 --> 27:07.124
and make two gallons.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.592
[tickle] turning into two.
Gonna start infusing.

27:08.594 --> 27:10.894
Gonna infuse it baby.

27:10.896 --> 27:12.997
-They'll pay three times of
price with the damsons in it.
-All right.

27:12.999 --> 27:13.764
Damn right.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.699
<i>  Damsons are very special.</i>

27:15.701 --> 27:18.836
These things ain't been seen,
in many, many years.

27:18.838 --> 27:21.705
<i>  And we've got</i>
<i>  a lot of money,</i>
<i>  we need to make up,</i>

27:21.707 --> 27:23.874
<i> from the downturn that we had.</i>

27:23.876 --> 27:26.710
<i>  And one of the best ways,</i>
<i>  to do that,</i>

27:26.712 --> 27:29.213
<i>  is by infusing</i>
<i>  fruit into our liquor.</i>

27:29.448 --> 27:30.614
Should be just about it.

27:30.683 --> 27:33.250
Anybody, that's ever had
damson moonshine,
will tell you,

27:33.252 --> 27:36.020
this right here,
is a high-dollar commodity.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.689
-It's gonna take about
a month, for it to infuse--
-like it ought to be.

27:38.691 --> 27:39.823
Yeah, like it should be.

27:39.825 --> 27:40.958
It couldn't happened
any better time.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.726
That we can take
that same liquor,

27:42.728 --> 27:45.095
and turn into
a lot more profit.

27:45.097 --> 27:47.698
So tomorrow, we pick up
the jars we need, sugar.

27:47.700 --> 27:48.932
[kenny] and the fruit.

27:48.934 --> 27:49.633
-[henry] get back in here.
-[tickle] rock and roll.

27:49.635 --> 27:51.235
Let's do it.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.976
[digger] if anybody in
the country got any bottles,
it'll be him.

27:58.978 --> 28:00.878
[knocking]

28:00.880 --> 28:02.246
bottles, they're
in short supply.

28:02.248 --> 28:03.647
Everything seems to be.

28:03.683 --> 28:07.418
<i>  There's one person,</i>
<i>  in our area,</i>
<i>  that uses lot of bottles.</i>

28:07.420 --> 28:08.986
<i>  So, we're coming back</i>
<i>  to our friend, john.</i>

28:08.988 --> 28:11.021
At english mountain
spring water.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.657
<i> [digger] we need</i>
<i>  500 glass bottle.</i>

28:13.659 --> 28:14.058
That's a big order.

28:14.060 --> 28:14.792
[john] hey guys.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.994
-How are you?
-Hello, john.

28:16.996 --> 28:20.164
Well, all the resources
we know,
that provide bottles.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.566
You know,
they're non-existent.

28:22.568 --> 28:23.634
[mark] well,

28:23.636 --> 28:25.903
man, this is
a massive building.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.938
You've been wanting to learn
how to rollerblade, mark,

28:27.940 --> 28:29.306
this would be the place,
for you to come.

28:29.308 --> 28:31.275
-[laughing]
-[mark] on about that.

28:31.277 --> 28:35.012
[digger] the upside is,
we ain't looking for a place
to make no liquor right now.

28:35.014 --> 28:37.581
-[john] well.
-But we're kind of up a stump
on another situation.

28:37.583 --> 28:38.716
Okay.

28:38.718 --> 28:42.786
We've got a guy,
that's been
a little difficult.

28:42.788 --> 28:44.955
And he wants bottles,
and not mason jars.

28:44.957 --> 28:47.458
We need 500--

28:47.460 --> 28:49.760
okay, I've got a few.

28:49.762 --> 28:52.763
That what you're looking for,
I thought you need more.

28:52.765 --> 28:54.698
500 is just
a drop in the bucket.

28:54.700 --> 28:55.999
[digger] those glass?

28:56.001 --> 28:58.202
Those are not glass,
those pet.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.570
Uh, plastic.

28:59.572 --> 29:03.841
Honestly, I think glass
is really what we need.

29:03.843 --> 29:06.143
I might have something,
that you can look at.

29:06.145 --> 29:07.277
We've always been taught,

29:07.279 --> 29:08.712
if you proud of your liquor,
you won't put it in plastic.

29:08.714 --> 29:10.914
<i> Plastic degrades with alcohol.</i>

29:10.916 --> 29:13.951
Leaching something,
in your liquor,
you don't want.

29:13.953 --> 29:16.720
[mark] well, look at these
damn bottles there.

29:16.722 --> 29:18.122
[digger] electrolyte water.

29:18.124 --> 29:18.889
[mark] ain't that something.

29:18.891 --> 29:20.858
There's you,
some caffeine water.

29:20.860 --> 29:23.994
I don't need to go no faster,
I'm already going fast--

29:23.996 --> 29:26.130
you go any faster,
you gonna be stopped.

29:26.632 --> 29:27.898
[laughing]

29:27.900 --> 29:29.433
I don't even know
why I'm friends with him.

29:29.435 --> 29:30.968
[chuckles]

29:30.970 --> 29:34.037
well guys, here's I think,
what you might be looking for.

29:34.039 --> 29:36.039
This is the actual bottle.

29:36.709 --> 29:38.342
It's a 750 milliliter.

29:38.944 --> 29:41.645
And we ended up with these--

29:41.647 --> 29:44.414
uh, we had a customer,
that pulled their project.

29:44.416 --> 29:46.984
-You just inherited them.
-Just inherited them

29:46.986 --> 29:48.552
and so--

29:48.554 --> 29:51.421
does that look like something,
like you got in mind.

29:51.423 --> 29:53.557
-Looks a lot like,
what we need.
-[mark] exactly.

29:53.559 --> 29:54.758
And--

29:54.760 --> 29:56.760
that's what they call
a bar top or a tea cork.

29:56.762 --> 29:59.196
What we need to be
inquiring about now,

29:59.965 --> 30:02.166
is what we're looking at,
cost wise.

30:03.202 --> 30:04.768
You know, I mean,

30:04.804 --> 30:05.869
I know what you're doing.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.871
Or I think I know
what you're gonna do
with them.

30:07.873 --> 30:10.207
-I'd say, you got
a pretty good idea.
-So--

30:10.976 --> 30:13.076
I'd be willing to
do some trading.

30:13.813 --> 30:16.113
<i> [digger] john doesn't want</i>
<i>  money for these bottles.</i>

30:16.115 --> 30:18.215
<i>  He wants some of</i>
<i>  this tennessee whiskey.</i>

30:18.717 --> 30:19.883
But on top of that,

30:19.885 --> 30:22.052
we lost five or six gallons.

30:22.054 --> 30:23.987
We gave six gallons to shorty,

30:23.989 --> 30:26.356
for doing what he did for us.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.926
<i>  So, that's cutting into</i>
<i>  the liquor even more.</i>

30:28.928 --> 30:32.162
But we got to do,
what we got to do
to get these bottles.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.898
Right now,
we can probably shave--

30:34.900 --> 30:36.967
what close to six gallons,
off of that.

30:36.969 --> 30:38.135
I think that's fair.

30:38.571 --> 30:39.570
Consider them yours.

30:39.572 --> 30:41.405
We couldn't be
any happier with all this.

30:41.407 --> 30:42.406
-It's outstanding.
-Oh, yeah. Well.

30:42.408 --> 30:43.974
<i> [digger] all that's</i>
<i>  left to do now,</i>

30:43.976 --> 30:46.577
<i>  is get some of these bottles</i>
<i>  loaded up on the trailer,</i>

30:46.579 --> 30:48.545
<i> get them back to headquarters.</i>

30:48.547 --> 30:50.714
<i>  Bottle some of beaz',</i>
<i>  liquor it.</i>

30:50.716 --> 30:52.649
<i>  Get them on the way,</i>
<i>  down the road.</i>
<i>  Get rid of these.</i>

30:52.651 --> 30:54.518
Beaz just has to
understand that,

30:54.520 --> 30:59.189
he lost six gallons of it,
on his own by insisting
that it go in these bottles.

31:11.937 --> 31:14.638
<i> [richard] oh, I like the look.</i>
<i>  I like the smell.</i>

31:14.640 --> 31:15.739
<i>  On the last</i>
<i>  white absinthe run,</i>

31:15.741 --> 31:17.241
<i>  it was too much wormwood.</i>

31:17.243 --> 31:19.409
So, we had to go through,
the process again.

31:19.411 --> 31:21.678
<i>  Another base spirit,</i>
<i>  another maceration.</i>

31:21.680 --> 31:24.848
<i>  And twice the lemon balm,</i>
<i>  this is strong.</i>

31:24.850 --> 31:25.749
Doubling up on the lemon balm.

31:25.751 --> 31:27.451
<i> Giving it more than it needed.</i>

31:27.453 --> 31:29.853
<i>  Because we're gonna</i>
<i>  dump that back,</i>
<i>  into the pot.</i>

31:29.855 --> 31:32.589
We're gonna take the spirits,
that we ran already,

31:32.591 --> 31:34.424
that didn't have
any lemon balm in it.

31:35.594 --> 31:36.860
<i>  This is the last piece</i>
<i>  of the puzzle.</i>

31:36.862 --> 31:39.563
<i>  This is our white absinthe,</i>
<i>  from the last run.</i>

31:39.565 --> 31:41.899
Getting all this together,
for just this one run.

31:41.901 --> 31:44.768
<i>  There is thousands</i>
<i>  of dollars, invested.</i>

31:44.770 --> 31:45.903
We've got to get this right.

31:45.905 --> 31:47.404
This right here has to work.

31:47.406 --> 31:50.707
I've never worked this hard,
for an alcohol.

31:50.709 --> 31:53.877
I put my blood,
sweat and tears, like,
I have with this product.

31:53.879 --> 31:55.145
It's starting to get warm too.

31:56.048 --> 31:57.748
That is a little workout.

31:57.750 --> 31:58.982
In the end,
we hope to achieve,

31:58.984 --> 32:00.951
a 160 to 140 proof.

32:00.953 --> 32:02.953
If we're in that range.

32:05.557 --> 32:07.424
It would knock it out
of the park again.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.893
Let me get some
more water, in that barrel.

32:09.895 --> 32:11.795
Watch that alligator,
out there.

32:11.797 --> 32:12.930
[richard] I ain't,
but a snack for him.

32:12.932 --> 32:15.399
He ain't gonna
waste his time,
with me.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.000
He might like
absinthe too, though.

32:17.870 --> 32:18.735
<i>  There's a lot at stake here.</i>

32:18.737 --> 32:20.771
<i>  It's not only</i>
<i>  money on the line.</i>

32:20.773 --> 32:22.773
I mean, it's our reputations
in the city like new orleans.

32:22.775 --> 32:24.608
I mean, phew.

32:24.610 --> 32:27.044
That's not something
we want to play with.

32:28.914 --> 32:30.447
Oh, yeah,
she's running good, now.

32:31.684 --> 32:32.783
Once, we throw the heads out,

32:32.785 --> 32:35.052
I get a chance,
to take the first taste of it.

32:35.054 --> 32:38.155
See, what our brand-new,
white absinthe taste like.

32:38.157 --> 32:39.256
This is what it's all about.

32:40.392 --> 32:41.291
Mmm-hmm.

32:43.996 --> 32:45.896
Yeah. Ooh, yeah.

32:45.898 --> 32:47.331
That's sweet
citrus flavor, man.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.266
That calm that wormwood down.

32:49.268 --> 32:50.734
You got that lemon balm.

32:50.736 --> 32:51.835
Mmm-hmm.

32:51.837 --> 32:53.403
<i> [richard] this tastes good.</i>

32:53.405 --> 32:55.238
This is the absinthe,
that we were looking for.

32:55.240 --> 32:58.008
I can taste that
the flavors are not
crashing into each other.

32:58.010 --> 33:00.610
That they're layering.
That they're marrying
each other well.

33:00.612 --> 33:01.845
That's the stuff.

33:01.847 --> 33:03.413
That's what we could sell
a customer right here.

33:03.415 --> 33:04.781
After we make it green.

33:04.783 --> 33:06.416
It's gonna make us some green.

33:06.952 --> 33:08.785
<i>  I see the customer</i>
<i>  in the big city,</i>

33:08.787 --> 33:10.053
you know, and he
really likes our liquor.

33:10.055 --> 33:10.887
Is that a green absinthe.

33:10.889 --> 33:12.589
That's green absinthe.

33:12.591 --> 33:13.890
<i> [richard] I hope,</i>
<i>  that he asks us</i>
<i>  for some more.</i>

33:13.892 --> 33:16.026
Something, more
challenging than this.

33:16.028 --> 33:17.794
<i>  That way we could</i>
<i>  get our names, out there.</i>

33:17.796 --> 33:20.097
Let people know
we're capable of
pretty much anything,

33:20.099 --> 33:21.031
as far as liquor goes.

33:21.033 --> 33:22.866
This guy's gonna go crazy,
when he see this.

33:22.868 --> 33:24.201
He's gonna go nuts.

33:24.370 --> 33:25.936
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

33:34.380 --> 33:37.414
All right. Let's see
if we can do this without
breaking no bottles.

33:37.416 --> 33:40.150
<i> [mark] just through</i>
<i>  the luck of</i>
<i>  the moonshine gods</i>

33:40.152 --> 33:42.719
<i>  we was able to</i>
<i>  locate some bottles.</i>

33:42.721 --> 33:44.688
So, we're gonna be able,

33:44.690 --> 33:48.091
to give beaz his liquor,
in the bottles,
he's requested.

33:48.093 --> 33:50.293
And today's the day,
he's coming for it.

33:51.230 --> 33:52.863
[exclaiming]

33:52.865 --> 33:53.463
look at that.

33:53.465 --> 33:55.766
[mark] don't that pretty?

33:55.768 --> 33:58.368
It looks like little soldiers,
lined up to go to battle.

33:59.772 --> 34:01.671
<i>  Getting the liquor bottle up.</i>

34:01.673 --> 34:03.874
We've got these
big fermenters.

34:03.876 --> 34:04.908
<i>  They've got a spigot on it.</i>

34:05.411 --> 34:07.978
<i>  We put a hose</i>
<i>  and the bottling wand on it.</i>

34:07.980 --> 34:09.246
And we're moving
right along, here.

34:09.248 --> 34:10.047
[mark] we are.

34:10.049 --> 34:11.748
[digger] you stick
the wand in there,

34:11.750 --> 34:13.984
pull it out quickly
and it leaves enough
headspace,

34:13.986 --> 34:15.352
that the cork won't blow out.

34:15.788 --> 34:17.487
Liquor this fine,

34:17.489 --> 34:19.423
deserves this fine
little bottle.

34:19.425 --> 34:21.825
Now this honestly be
a good time, I guess,

34:21.827 --> 34:24.361
to sing, "99 bottles of
whiskey on the wall."

34:34.406 --> 34:35.972
I'm just really seeing,

34:35.974 --> 34:39.976
a wonderful product,
and dollar signs.

34:39.978 --> 34:42.779
83 gallons is what
he's got here.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.714
He's thinking, we've got 90.

34:44.716 --> 34:46.383
But actually, we've got 83.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.418
I'm telling you harry
we we ought to save us,

34:48.420 --> 34:50.253
a box of this piece.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.958
We worked way too hard for it,
not to reward ourselves.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.760
It's the first
sea-aged liquor,

34:56.762 --> 34:58.495
that he and I have done.

34:58.497 --> 35:01.698
So, of course,
we want to save us
a little memento.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.834
He said that
he'd be here,
in 20 minutes.

35:03.836 --> 35:05.469
We're not gonna be greedy.

35:05.471 --> 35:07.070
But we want a little memento,

35:07.072 --> 35:09.339
of the first,
sea-aged liquor,
we've done.

35:13.979 --> 35:16.012
Hey. Hey, buddy.

35:16.482 --> 35:17.848
-Good to see you. Hey, man.
-Hey, man.

35:17.850 --> 35:21.051
-How are you? Good.
-I'm good, man.
I'm doing great.

35:21.053 --> 35:24.821
All right, gentlemen, well,
let's get this knocked out.

35:24.823 --> 35:27.090
So, we got it all in bottles.

35:27.092 --> 35:29.126
[mark] got all that
we got in bottles.

35:29.795 --> 35:33.029
All right. Now, what did
those bottles run me?

35:33.031 --> 35:36.666
Uh, them bottles
had a net cost to you,

35:36.668 --> 35:38.401
of six gallons
of that liquor.

35:39.571 --> 35:43.373
So, why did you
trade the liquor,

35:43.375 --> 35:45.575
instead of just money,
to get the bottle?

35:45.577 --> 35:48.945
Seems like,
the liquors harder
to get for us.

35:48.947 --> 35:51.381
The guy
that owned the bottles
thought so too.

35:52.117 --> 35:53.750
-He didn't need the money.
-Okay.

35:53.752 --> 35:54.784
He didn't want the money.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.086
He wanted the liquor.

35:56.088 --> 35:57.587
And honestly and truly,

35:57.589 --> 35:58.755
it's just so good,

35:58.757 --> 36:01.892
digger and I are gonna keep,
two and a half gallons each.

36:01.894 --> 36:05.295
So, with all said and done,
at the end of the day,

36:06.431 --> 36:08.331
we only have 78 gallons.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.000
78?

36:18.877 --> 36:20.177
[henry] is that
a whole deer on the road?

36:20.879 --> 36:21.778
Yes they are.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.313
You couldn't pay me to
shoot one of them.

36:24.016 --> 36:25.615
Now, I just don't
like the meat.

36:25.617 --> 36:27.017
Just depends
on how it's done.

36:27.019 --> 36:29.219
I done heard them stories
all my life.

36:29.221 --> 36:30.520
How it's done, nothing.

36:30.522 --> 36:33.823
You grind it up,
with some beef fat
or something like that in it

36:33.825 --> 36:34.758
and a ittle bit of seasoning.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.026
It's good like that

36:36.028 --> 36:38.094
and depends on when
they kill that deer too.

36:38.096 --> 36:40.096
If you got those in a rut.

36:40.098 --> 36:41.765
Meaning, they ready to mate.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.567
And you kill a buck.

36:43.569 --> 36:46.770
That sumbitch is gonna
taste so gamey.
It ain't funny.

36:46.772 --> 36:48.838
They got his nuts
full ready to roll.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.140
You know what I'm saying?

36:50.475 --> 36:51.541
So, there you are.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.143
Are you painting another one
of them pictures for me?

36:53.145 --> 36:55.111
[laughing]

36:55.113 --> 36:56.079
what the [bleeps]

36:56.081 --> 36:58.315
[laughing]

37:01.687 --> 37:02.652
[tickle] all right.

37:03.088 --> 37:05.655
It seems like
all of our small still sites,

37:05.657 --> 37:06.890
are really paying off.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.558
The stash house is filling up.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.827
<i>  We got hold of some damsons.</i>

37:10.829 --> 37:14.731
<i>  Makes a very good tasting,</i>
<i>  smooth liquor.</i>

37:14.733 --> 37:17.400
That sells for a lot of money.

37:17.402 --> 37:21.037
<i> [henry] it's been ten years</i>
<i>  since we've got lucky enough,</i>
<i>  to get these boxes, here.</i>

37:21.039 --> 37:22.339
<i>  At least ten years.</i>

37:22.774 --> 37:23.940
<i>  So, we're excited about.</i>

37:25.544 --> 37:28.178
We got a secret mix,
we've been doing
for years on this.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.547
Can't let too many
people know about it.

37:30.549 --> 37:31.781
What I do here,

37:31.783 --> 37:34.017
put the sugar in,
we're gonna throw,
liquor in there.

37:34.019 --> 37:35.852
We're gonna throw
those damsons in.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.120
Now, these are
beautiful damsons.

37:37.856 --> 37:40.857
<i>  When you start infusing</i>
<i>  fruit with your liquor,</i>

37:40.859 --> 37:42.859
<i>  it's a lot of money</i>
<i>  to be made.</i>

37:42.861 --> 37:44.227
And you turn it
into two gallons.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.029
You know, do the math.

37:47.799 --> 37:48.832
You take some good moonshine,

37:48.834 --> 37:51.034
and put it with
a quality fruit.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.669
You talk and you got
some big bucks.

37:52.671 --> 37:53.770
I mean big bucks.

37:53.772 --> 37:56.473
You taking a case,
make it two cases.

37:56.475 --> 37:59.709
And you're tripling,
the price of a gallon liquor.

37:59.711 --> 38:02.912
You hear rumors about,
if people put
fruit in to shine,

38:02.914 --> 38:04.981
they covering up bad shine.

38:05.083 --> 38:05.949
<i>  Well, you know what?</i>

38:05.951 --> 38:07.384
<i>  Maybe somewhere else,</i>

38:07.386 --> 38:09.552
<i>  but this is franklin county.</i>

38:09.554 --> 38:12.722
This is henry law,
tickle, kenny law.

38:12.724 --> 38:14.791
We don't even know,
what bad shine is.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.826
That sugar is gonna
still settle at the bottom.

38:16.828 --> 38:18.395
We'll come back a day later.

38:18.397 --> 38:19.763
And we'll shake
that baby again.

38:19.765 --> 38:22.932
And by then, the sugar
should be dissolved
enough for--

38:22.934 --> 38:26.403
it will start infusing
the berries and juices from
these damson, right here.

38:26.405 --> 38:27.604
People gonna beg for it.

38:27.606 --> 38:29.773
We started out
real rough this year,

38:29.775 --> 38:33.576
but you know,
now things are
starting to look up.

38:33.578 --> 38:37.180
<i>  We've got still sites</i>
<i>  all over the place.</i>

38:37.182 --> 38:39.549
<i>  We got peach brandy</i>
<i>  on the way.</i>

38:39.551 --> 38:41.785
And if it keeps on going
the way that it is,

38:41.787 --> 38:43.887
I can really see us,
pulling this thing off.

38:43.889 --> 38:45.188
Should listen
to the sound. Listen.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.024
What does it sound like?

38:48.026 --> 38:49.993
-Sounds like money.
-Sounds like money, huh?

38:49.995 --> 38:51.094
[chuckles]

38:59.638 --> 39:01.137
78?

39:02.974 --> 39:05.408
-Yeah.
-Oh, my gosh.
Y'all, that--

39:05.410 --> 39:06.843
that sucks, man.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.845
-That makes me look bad.
-[digger] I get it but--

39:08.847 --> 39:11.748
of course, what we're keeping,
the five gallons collectively,

39:11.750 --> 39:12.816
between me and mark.

39:12.818 --> 39:14.150
We'll absorb that.

39:14.152 --> 39:15.085
Yeah, I shouldn't--

39:15.087 --> 39:18.822
we'll absorb the problem
with the bunk leaking.

39:18.824 --> 39:20.090
Because that was on us.

39:20.092 --> 39:22.425
Let's do this, 78 gallons.

39:23.228 --> 39:25.195
How about, I pay you--

39:25.697 --> 39:26.996
$17,000?

39:28.600 --> 39:30.533
-Uh-huh.
-We told you there's no more
aged liquor. Okay.

39:30.535 --> 39:31.768
And when I called
you later to ask.

39:31.770 --> 39:34.871
When you called back,
I said, we could have it
in six months.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.940
-All right.
-That involved
the rapid aging process,

39:36.942 --> 39:37.540
done on the ocean.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.275
-That was--
-so--

39:39.277 --> 39:41.378
-I didn't know, what
you would do to age liquor.
-You wanted to age liquor.

39:41.380 --> 39:44.080
-It don't matter.
It's our liquor--
-now, listen. Tomato. Tomato.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.949
[mark] we can go around here,
all in all, together.

39:45.951 --> 39:46.916
It's your fault.

39:46.918 --> 39:48.618
My fault. It's his fault.

39:48.620 --> 39:51.087
It's everybody's
frigging fault here.

39:51.790 --> 39:54.391
I'm gonna make
an executive decision here.

39:54.393 --> 39:56.426
When I say this, this is it.

39:56.428 --> 39:59.229
18 grand. Not negotiable.

39:59.231 --> 40:00.397
Take it or frigging leave it.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.733
-It is what it is.
-It is what it is.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.735
I'm gonna take that deal.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.338
One of the reasons,
is because--

40:09.007 --> 40:10.974
they are gonna
love that liquor.

40:10.976 --> 40:12.776
Looking to the future.

40:12.778 --> 40:15.712
I don't want to be the guy,
that didn't show up
with anything.

40:15.714 --> 40:16.913
-I understand.
-I get that.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.648
You know, things
happen sometimes.

40:18.650 --> 40:20.250
You don't get
your full shipment.

40:20.252 --> 40:22.652
-Let's put your liquor
in your truck.
-[beaz] all right.

40:22.654 --> 40:27.090
I am thrilled to know,
and to be done with
this tennessee whiskey order.

40:30.829 --> 40:33.096
Your account just went down,
another gallon.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.431
They're down to 77.

40:35.867 --> 40:37.200
[sighing]

40:37.235 --> 40:38.635
just take the rest of these,
and throw it in
the damn dumpster.

40:38.637 --> 40:40.170
And get it over with.

40:40.172 --> 40:41.905
If he don't hurry
and get out of east tennessee,

40:41.907 --> 40:44.874
he ain't gonna have
enough damn liquor,

40:44.876 --> 40:46.943
to take a pill with,
for a snake bit.

40:49.014 --> 40:49.913
[bleeps]

40:49.915 --> 40:52.015
[laughing]

40:53.118 --> 40:54.818
I give up.

40:54.820 --> 40:56.219
[digger] oh, god, beaz.

40:56.555 --> 40:58.922
[laughing]

40:58.924 --> 41:01.624
-what, he break another one?
-He broke another one.

41:01.626 --> 41:03.059
<i>  Haste makes waste.</i>

41:03.061 --> 41:04.961
That's definitely,
on his hands.

41:05.096 --> 41:06.129
Literally.

41:06.131 --> 41:06.529
And his feet.

41:06.531 --> 41:08.832
All right.

41:08.834 --> 41:10.733
You get on out of here before
you cause my building
to fall or something.

41:10.735 --> 41:12.936
-[chuckles] yeah,
no kidding man.
-[digger chuckles]

41:12.938 --> 41:13.937
<i> [digger] now,</i>
<i>  at the end of the day,</i>

41:13.939 --> 41:15.605
<i>  it was a learning experience,</i>
<i>  for all of us.</i>

41:15.607 --> 41:17.040
And we've come upon something,

41:17.042 --> 41:19.509
that we might put into use,
from here on out.

41:19.511 --> 41:22.345
We have got to try
to figure out something.

41:24.115 --> 41:27.951
To replicate that sea-aging,
in the mountains.
