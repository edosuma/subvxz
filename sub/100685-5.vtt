WEBVTT

00:12.805 --> 00:14.598
(sighs)

00:15.933 --> 00:17.768
I wish you could be there
with us.

00:20.146 --> 00:21.522
Miss you.

00:24.942 --> 00:26.068
(sighs)

00:36.287 --> 00:37.747
Hey, Brenner.

00:37.788 --> 00:41.167
You don't call in a complaint
about me straight to my chief.

00:41.167 --> 00:44.587
Bone to pick, don't be a pussy.
Come to me.

00:44.587 --> 00:47.047
-Chain of command, Detective.
-Bullshit.

00:47.089 --> 00:49.341
Harassing a victim is bullshit.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.260
The Kent case is closed.

00:51.302 --> 00:52.970
-Craver murder isn't.
-So go solve it.

00:53.012 --> 00:54.388
And get out of our way.

00:54.430 --> 00:55.723
Speaking of bullshit,

00:55.765 --> 00:57.308
that file you sent us
is Exhibit A.

00:57.349 --> 00:58.934
He was your fucking C.I.

00:58.976 --> 01:02.772
You got everything on Craver
that isn't classified.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.442
(indistinct radio chatter)

01:06.484 --> 01:08.152
She call it in?

01:08.194 --> 01:10.821
Woke up this morning to a
"thud, thud, thudding" sound.

01:10.863 --> 01:13.240
-PIERCE: She see anything?
-SHEPHERD: Never got out of bed.

01:13.282 --> 01:14.909
(radio chatter continues)

01:19.163 --> 01:20.998
Looks like thudding to me.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.584
-Yeah.
-(flies buzzing)

01:30.591 --> 01:33.052
Nothing of import. How much time
we got left on this bad boy?

01:33.093 --> 01:34.678
48 hours.
Clock's ticking.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.557
(sighs)
Listening as fast as I can.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.070
(both chuckle)

01:54.198 --> 01:55.699
How'd it go with Brenner?

01:55.741 --> 01:59.161
Think I rattled his cage.
Time will tell.

01:59.203 --> 02:01.080
You know, Computer Crimes
does this full-time.

02:01.121 --> 02:04.959
Tech's digging into
his laptop, phone, cloud.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.586
Some of that's encrypted.
I got these.

02:14.510 --> 02:15.928
Who's that?

02:16.971 --> 02:18.389
Daisy Clayton.

I'm shocked the judge
gave you a wiretap.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.854
We might get harder evidence
from the hidden camera.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.523
If you can ever locate the data.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.150
And then again, you might not.

03:53.192 --> 03:55.819
We need to lock her story down
before the wire expires.

03:55.861 --> 03:58.614
She feels us closing in,
she might give up her partner.

03:58.656 --> 04:01.951
You're confident
her accomplice is a Fed?

04:01.992 --> 04:03.118
Yes, sir.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.497
This calls for more caution,
not less.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.792
(sighs)

04:09.833 --> 04:12.127
Want us to brief the lieutenant?

04:12.169 --> 04:14.922
-I'll take care of it.
-Thank you, sir.

04:16.840 --> 04:19.259
(door opens, closes)

04:21.095 --> 04:24.306
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:24.348 --> 04:27.351
Okay.

04:27.393 --> 04:30.187
Well... quiet night.

04:30.229 --> 04:34.233
Oh, saw Bad Day At Black Rock
on my phone.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.735
Robert Ryan owns the movie.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.529
The Professionals?

04:38.570 --> 04:41.323
Ah, best western cast
this side of The Wild Bunch.

04:41.365 --> 04:44.952
-Mm-hmm.
-You've got Ryan, Lancaster,
Lee Marvin,

04:44.994 --> 04:48.080
-Jack Palance...
-Claudia Cardinale.

04:48.122 --> 04:49.790
-Woody Strode...
-(chuckles)

04:49.832 --> 04:50.833
Mm.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.252
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.170
Sean Terrion and Teddy Hobbs?

04:55.212 --> 04:57.506
CAPs case
you handled last summer?

04:58.549 --> 05:01.301
Yeah. Frequent flyers.

05:01.343 --> 05:03.721
Saw Mr. Hobbs
just last week, in fact.

05:03.762 --> 05:06.974
Naked Comes the Stranger.
(chuckles)

05:07.016 --> 05:08.976
So... more turf wars?

05:09.018 --> 05:10.686
Hostile takeover.

05:10.728 --> 05:13.105
-How hostile?
-Lethal.

05:13.147 --> 05:16.734
-Which one?
-Terrion.

05:16.775 --> 05:18.610
Head bashed in.

05:19.611 --> 05:22.364
Where do we find Hobbs?

05:22.406 --> 05:25.159
Sunset and Las Palmas.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.622
(sighs)

05:30.664 --> 05:32.207
Might be wise to hold off
on paying out

05:32.249 --> 05:33.876
on Mr. Kent's policy

05:33.917 --> 05:36.545
until we finish
our investigation.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.797
Oh, happy to bring it
to your attention. Any time.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.215
You're welcome.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.550
Who was that?

05:41.592 --> 05:43.635
(exhales)
Kent's insurance company.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.220
Nothing like
a homicide investigation

05:45.262 --> 05:47.306
-to gum up the works.
-Exactly.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.891
That'll get her attention.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.101
Got to follow up on a lead
on Daisy Clayton.

05:51.143 --> 05:52.561
Let me know if the wire
heats up.

06:12.748 --> 06:16.502
Compensation for wrongful
incarceration changed in 2016,

06:16.543 --> 06:18.337
from a hundred dollars per day

06:18.378 --> 06:20.839
-to $140...
-Just give me the number.

06:20.881 --> 06:24.093
-$500,000.
-For ten years?

06:24.134 --> 06:27.179
-Shit.
-But...

06:27.221 --> 06:29.348
-if the county owed you more...
-Why would they?

06:29.389 --> 06:31.892
A number of reasons.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.686
Say the D.A. withheld
exculpatory evidence.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.772
-That means...
-I know what exculpatory means.

06:38.357 --> 06:39.316
Did they?

06:39.358 --> 06:41.860
-We think they did.
-What else?

06:41.902 --> 06:46.281
For untreated medical issues,
food poisoning, illness...

06:46.323 --> 06:47.866
Pneumonia?

06:47.908 --> 06:50.619
'Cause it's colder
than ice cream on a bad tooth.

06:51.662 --> 06:53.997
Or the guards failed
to protect you

06:54.039 --> 06:55.457
from a violent inmate.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.129
CROW:
This do?

07:01.171 --> 07:02.881
Motherfucker shanked me
in the yard.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.341
That works.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.178
What's the number?

07:08.220 --> 07:10.389
Five to seven million.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.852
-Minus your cut.
-Minus my cut.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.270
Which is?

07:16.311 --> 07:18.564
-30%.
-Contingency.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.441
Contingency. Absolutely.

07:24.194 --> 07:25.654
Let's roll the dice.

07:25.696 --> 07:28.532
Know what I'm saying?

07:44.631 --> 07:47.384
Welcome to Bradco Kitchen
and Bath.

07:47.426 --> 07:50.470
Detective Bosch. LAPD.

07:50.512 --> 07:53.891
-Alex Sands?
-Yes.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.059
Working a cold case.
Maybe you can help.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.978
A cold case?

07:58.020 --> 07:59.438
About ten years ago.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.024
Back in '09,
a girl named Daisy Clayton.

08:03.609 --> 08:06.195
I, uh... I thought
they caught that guy.

08:06.236 --> 08:09.573
They caught a serial killer.
Not the one that killed her.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.576
Oh, I just don't--
I always thought it was the...

08:12.618 --> 08:13.952
You were friends.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.121
We were.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.041
Her mother thinks
you were more than that.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.835
Just friends. That's it.

08:21.877 --> 08:23.962
She was a couple years
younger than me.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.464
(inhales)
Took her under my wing.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.798
Looked out for her.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.634
We thought it was fun.
(chuckles)

08:28.675 --> 08:30.135
Running the streets.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.762
Romantic.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.138
Living on the edge.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.600
Didn't turn out that way,
did it?

08:36.642 --> 08:38.644
No.

08:40.896 --> 08:43.482
No, it didn't.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.320
Thanks.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.529
VEGA:
Shit.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.073
Yeah, I know.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.491
Okay.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.826
Nobody's seen Hobbs.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.078
What'd the D.A. want?

08:56.119 --> 08:57.454
Body parts case.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.289
We need to interview
the defendant's cellmate

08:59.331 --> 09:00.916
for the Special Circs memo.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.293
-Where?
-Kern.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.587
-When?
-Tomorrow.

09:05.629 --> 09:08.757
Damn. We lose half a day.

09:08.799 --> 09:10.968
What you gonna do?

09:11.009 --> 09:14.304
Let's flag Hobbs on CHERS,
maybe he pops up.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.813
After what happened to Daisy,
I quit the streets.

09:22.854 --> 09:24.106
Cleaned up my act.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.691
Where'd you go?

09:25.732 --> 09:27.192
Home. Sacramento.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.610
Scared straight.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.487
How straight?

09:30.529 --> 09:32.364
Well, look at me.
(chuckles)

09:32.406 --> 09:35.242
Uh, got a job, wife, kid.

09:35.284 --> 09:36.660
Fuckin' minivan. Hmm.

09:36.702 --> 09:38.620
Last time you saw Daisy?

09:38.662 --> 09:41.873
Uh, that-that night.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.626
-Night it happened.
-Yeah, uh...

09:44.668 --> 09:48.046
We had a spat and she split.

09:48.088 --> 09:52.175
And I saw her... on Sunset.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.136
Talking to some guy in a van.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.387
She get in?

09:55.429 --> 09:58.265
I don't know.

09:58.307 --> 09:59.558
I assumed she was still
pissed at me,

09:59.599 --> 10:01.184
so I turned and walked away.

10:03.437 --> 10:06.440
(stammers)
And I never saw her again.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.151
What kind of van?

10:09.192 --> 10:11.611
Oh, yeah, um...

10:11.653 --> 10:13.447
white, maybe?

10:13.488 --> 10:17.617
Uh... a-a panel truck.

10:17.659 --> 10:18.827
I'm sorry, I...
(chuckles)

10:18.869 --> 10:20.746
I didn't think much of it.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.539
That was Daisy's deal.

10:22.581 --> 10:24.499
She work the street?

10:24.541 --> 10:26.293
Oh, we all did.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.337
One way or another.

10:28.378 --> 10:31.882
After her murder, why didn't you
talk to the cops?

10:31.923 --> 10:34.217
I couldn't help her.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.386
And it could've cost me, so...

10:38.013 --> 10:39.848
What was I gonna
say to the cops, anyway?

10:39.890 --> 10:42.100
"Saw her get into a white van,"
for starters.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.144
I didn't say I saw her get in.

10:44.186 --> 10:46.146
You didn't have to.

10:52.986 --> 10:56.573
(door opens, closes)

11:00.827 --> 11:03.830
(drawer closes)

11:09.044 --> 11:11.630
-Donna says you got to eat.
-Yeah.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.299
Well, my sister
still has her husband.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.967
So she can feed it to him.

11:19.096 --> 11:21.973
I'll just put this
in the fridge. For now.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.275
Did you think any more
about what I asked you?

11:34.528 --> 11:36.530
I have.

11:36.571 --> 11:39.950
Yeah. The Feds
destroyed my family.

11:39.991 --> 11:42.702
They murdered my husband.

11:42.744 --> 11:46.623
They bore false witness,
blamed us.

11:46.665 --> 11:49.418
I want hard justice, Ian.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.670
For the ones who did it.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.630
If you can't help me,

11:53.672 --> 11:56.675
I'll find someone who can.

12:07.102 --> 12:10.605
So, when should I reach out
to Mrs. Kent?

12:10.647 --> 12:12.607
Give her another day to stew.

12:12.649 --> 12:16.736
Isn't that cutting it close?
There's a clock on the wire.

12:16.778 --> 12:19.531
We've got to find
what we're looking for first.

12:19.573 --> 12:20.991
Cooper didn't fill you in?

12:21.032 --> 12:23.076
No, he did.

12:23.118 --> 12:24.578
I was just double-checking.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.254
(tapping keyboard)

12:36.590 --> 12:38.925
Damn it.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.594
(exhales)

12:47.476 --> 12:49.519
Done one of these before, Chief?

12:49.561 --> 12:52.147
High school. Debate team.

12:52.189 --> 12:54.191
Uh-oh, a ringer.

12:57.235 --> 12:58.612
How'd you land Thacker?

12:58.653 --> 13:00.447
Killoran's been
courting him for months.

13:00.489 --> 13:02.824
With the right message.

13:02.866 --> 13:05.744
A message making
a difference to Thacker?

13:05.785 --> 13:08.455
That would be a first.

13:08.497 --> 13:10.290
Break a leg out there.

13:10.332 --> 13:13.084
Councilwoman.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.795
(whispers):
Susanna.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.547
Chief Irving.

13:17.589 --> 13:18.757
Jack Killoran.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.967
-The car czar.
-(chuckles)

13:21.009 --> 13:23.720
My reputation precedes me.

13:23.762 --> 13:26.473
-Your ads.
-Yours, too.

13:26.515 --> 13:28.517
We aren't running any yet.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.018
Oh, you don't have to.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.521
Because everybody knows
your story.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.732
How you worked your way up
from patrol cop to head cop.

13:35.774 --> 13:38.568
Native Angelino, favorite son.

13:38.610 --> 13:43.532
And now, a top-notch rainmaker
like Ray Thacker in your corner.

13:43.573 --> 13:47.577
(laughs): Oh, come on, man,
that's not even fair.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.579
I hear you made him an offer.

13:49.621 --> 13:52.916
Yeah. I couldn't
close that deal.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.753
For a grassroots campaign,

13:56.795 --> 14:01.007
you're in bed with
some very fat cats.

14:01.049 --> 14:03.051
Chief, it's time.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.184
Good luck.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.853
And to you, too, sir.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.691
-(knocking)
-Open.

14:19.568 --> 14:22.237
Captain, is there a reason
I wasn't invited

14:22.279 --> 14:23.863
to the briefing this morning?

14:23.905 --> 14:25.532
No reason at all.

14:25.574 --> 14:27.325
Meant to bring you up to speed.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.202
Day got away from me.

14:29.244 --> 14:31.329
Bosch and Edgar catch you up?

14:31.371 --> 14:33.748
-Yeah, they did.
-Good.

14:35.750 --> 14:36.918
Something else?

14:36.960 --> 14:40.380
-Is there a problem?
-No.

14:40.422 --> 14:42.966
Are you still happy here, Grace?

14:45.343 --> 14:47.262
Been at Hollywood a long time.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.723
I'm fine.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.808
You know what they say.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.977
A change is as good as a rest.

14:54.019 --> 14:57.188
There's nowhere else
I'd rather be.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.525
Excellent.
Glad to hear it.

15:07.365 --> 15:09.367
(jazz music playing)

15:17.250 --> 15:19.794
-Hey.
-Leftover pizza.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.421
Jon & Vinny's.

15:21.463 --> 15:24.633
Tempted.
Had a late lunch.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.676
How was Mr. Crow?

15:29.554 --> 15:32.766
Honestly?
Kind of scary.

15:32.807 --> 15:36.436
Chandler must smell
a big payday in there somewhere.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.022
That's kind of cynical.

15:39.064 --> 15:41.232
She's cynical.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.485
She and her ex-con,
gaming the system.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.575
Sorry, Mads.

15:50.617 --> 15:54.996
Uh, Chandler... payday.

15:55.038 --> 15:57.874
That's all.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.709
I'm gonna walk Coltrane.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.795
Thanks.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.308
Were you nervous?

16:15.350 --> 16:19.771
Piece of cake, compared to
a Police Commission hearing.

16:19.813 --> 16:23.692
We'll see how the numbers
shake out, but good job.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.110
You sound surprised.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.237
(chuckles)
Not at all.

16:27.278 --> 16:32.158
Still, if you can manage
the occasional smile...

16:32.200 --> 16:36.705
I'll practice in the mirror.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.374
Killoran scored some points
on the homeless epidemic.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.876
What does he know about it?

16:41.918 --> 16:44.504
Sitting in his showroom
in Van Nuys.

16:44.546 --> 16:47.382
It's a set of complicated,
long-standing

16:47.424 --> 16:50.051
structural problems with no easy
one-size-fits-all solution.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.512
So you said.

16:52.554 --> 16:54.556
Sorry.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.558
He's gonna keep
beating that drum.

16:56.599 --> 16:58.643
He caught us flat-footed.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.020
We'll need to put out
a policy proposal

17:01.062 --> 17:03.398
-as soon as possible.
-And we will.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.776
Because it's the right thing
to do for the city.

17:06.818 --> 17:09.028
But fuck Killoran.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.657
Well said, Mr. Mayor.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.633
Jerry.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.552
Everything okay?

17:32.594 --> 17:34.179
Yeah. Just in the neighborhood.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.808
How are the boys?

17:38.850 --> 17:40.643
Haven't seen 'em much lately.

17:40.685 --> 17:43.021
-Busy?
-Swamped.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.774
(exhales)
I envy you.

17:45.815 --> 17:46.900
(chuckles)
Miss it?

17:46.941 --> 17:49.152
Of course I do.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.657
How's the investigation going?

17:54.699 --> 17:57.994
Progress.

17:58.036 --> 18:00.288
Assigned to RHD temporarily.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.749
-Marcos and Arias task force.
-Hmm.

18:02.791 --> 18:06.419
-What about the Haitian?
-I think we have an in.

18:09.631 --> 18:12.592
I got some new pictures
to show you.

18:12.634 --> 18:13.927
You promised me.

18:13.968 --> 18:16.638
I know, I know.
(sighs)

18:18.640 --> 18:20.934
You want to see 'em or not?

18:20.975 --> 18:22.727
(clicks tongue)

18:37.909 --> 18:39.702
Where is this?

18:39.744 --> 18:43.039
Repair garage in Jefferson Park.

18:43.081 --> 18:45.291
-You know about it?
-No.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.960
DWIGHT:
Jakes are in and out of there

18:47.001 --> 18:48.837
on a regular basis.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.589
Hovan set up a meet with Avril.

18:53.633 --> 18:57.554
His number two
showed up instead.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.264
I wonder if this is the guy.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.933
Remi Toussaint.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.812
I still got my sources.

19:05.854 --> 19:08.606
(inhales sharply, exhales)

19:08.648 --> 19:10.275
Keep this?

19:10.316 --> 19:12.861
(dance music pulsing inside)

19:17.323 --> 19:21.536
What kind of name is
Felix Mariama?

19:21.578 --> 19:23.204
Dominican.

19:23.246 --> 19:26.624
Moves a lot of product,
like he said.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.836
Housewives, businessmen.

19:29.878 --> 19:32.881
-Upscale?
-Mostly.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.716
Street, too.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.092
TOUSSAINT:
But not soft.

19:36.134 --> 19:38.177
AVRIL:
No.

19:38.219 --> 19:40.221
Not soft.

19:40.263 --> 19:41.514
TOUSSAINT:
Smart.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.893
The way he handled his problem.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.313
Are you satisfied?

19:48.354 --> 19:50.481
I am.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.901
But it's your call.

20:03.661 --> 20:06.789
I don't blame RHD for
taking it away from me.

20:06.831 --> 20:09.500
Daisy's murder fit their
Backseat Butcher M.O.

20:09.542 --> 20:13.254
-Except for the bleach.
-Except for the bleach.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.048
Then they found out
he was in the drunk tank

20:15.089 --> 20:18.092
the night she was killed,
couldn't have done it.

20:18.134 --> 20:19.719
Dropped her from the filing.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.429
Plenty of others
he was good for.

20:21.471 --> 20:24.390
Oh, yeah.
I asked to get back on it,

20:24.432 --> 20:26.351
but my L.T. said no.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.645
Cold case, street kid...

20:28.686 --> 20:30.897
Lost cause.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.276
From the lines on her body,

20:35.318 --> 20:37.904
she wasn't bleached
in a bathtub.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.155
That's what I thought.

20:39.197 --> 20:40.865
Small tub?

20:40.907 --> 20:43.242
Portable, plastic.

20:43.284 --> 20:47.080
Wash the body anywhere.
Vehicle, van.

20:47.121 --> 20:49.165
She had that mark
on her right hip.

20:49.207 --> 20:52.126
-An indentation, like a logo.
-Yeah, from the tub.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.712
"ASP."
American Storage Products.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.799
The thing is,
you can buy 'em anywhere.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.133
Walmart, Costco.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.219
Still, that's good work.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.679
Useful down the road.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.056
Let's hope.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.725
Hey, do me a favor.
Take a look at these.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.021
SERVIDONE:
John the Baptist.

21:12.063 --> 21:15.274
He called himself
John the Baptist.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.485
Ran a shelter for street kids.

21:17.527 --> 21:20.405
Moonlight Mission.
Get born again for a bed.

21:20.446 --> 21:23.032
Baptize 'em on the spot.

21:23.074 --> 21:25.368
(sighs)
David Curzon?

21:25.410 --> 21:29.122
He was a house painter.
Peeping Tom.

21:29.163 --> 21:31.290
He got hit by one of those
celebrity tour buses.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.837
But this John the Baptist,
he still around?

21:35.878 --> 21:37.880
Last I heard.

21:43.761 --> 21:44.846
(computer chimes)

21:50.727 --> 21:52.937
-Hmm.
-(computer chimes)

21:54.647 --> 21:57.275
Eight, seven, four, five.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.319
Eight, seven, four,
five.

22:00.361 --> 22:02.572
Eight, seven, four, five.

22:02.613 --> 22:05.700
Eight, seven, four,
five.

22:05.742 --> 22:08.286
Eight, seven, four, five.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.246
-Hmm.
-(drops pen)

22:10.288 --> 22:12.457
(phone vibrating)

22:15.543 --> 22:17.295
Hello, Alicia Kent.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.839
Hi. Lieutenant Grace Billets,
LAPD.

22:19.881 --> 22:21.466
We have your husband's effects.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.009
We'd like to
return them to you.

22:23.051 --> 22:26.012
His wallet, his wristwatch,
his wedding ring.

22:26.054 --> 22:28.222
Oh, I'd appreciate that.

22:28.264 --> 22:29.474
Yeah, when can you come in?

22:31.934 --> 22:34.020
Can you send them to me?
I'll pay for the messenger.

22:34.062 --> 22:36.856
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
you're gonna have to

22:36.898 --> 22:39.734
come sign for them
in person at the station.

22:39.776 --> 22:42.278
Station?

22:42.320 --> 22:45.239
Yeah. Hollywood Station.

22:45.281 --> 22:48.159
-What a pain.
-Well,

22:48.201 --> 22:50.745
-it's a chain of custody issue.
-When?

22:50.787 --> 22:53.748
Well, sooner is better. Today?

22:53.790 --> 22:56.584
-Tomorrow?
-I can't today.

22:56.626 --> 22:58.711
Okay, tomorrow, then.

22:58.753 --> 23:01.339
It won't take long.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.383
(indistinct chatter)

23:33.121 --> 23:34.413
Shit.

23:43.589 --> 23:44.632
Crate.

23:44.674 --> 23:46.634
Just resting my eyes.

23:46.676 --> 23:48.719
Tell me about
this "stay cool" text.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.639
Ah. Dead of night,
out of pattern.

23:51.681 --> 23:53.224
No number?

23:53.266 --> 23:55.393
Nope. Prepaid. Why?

23:55.434 --> 23:57.812
Same number as the burner cell
P.I. flagged

23:57.854 --> 23:59.397
on Alicia Kent's phone records.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.191
-Hey.
-Hey, we hook something?

24:02.233 --> 24:03.734
Her partner in crime, maybe.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.696
-Huh.
-You guys are wasted
on the CAPs desk.

24:06.737 --> 24:09.323
Mention that
to the powers that be.

24:09.365 --> 24:11.450
-How's Rodgers?
-Better.

24:11.492 --> 24:15.037
Sat up this morning,
had a little breakfast.

24:15.079 --> 24:16.914
Would appreciate a visit

24:16.956 --> 24:19.542
from either one of you
fair-weather friends.

24:19.584 --> 24:21.502
Point taken.

24:21.544 --> 24:24.005
Hey, Pierce called.

24:24.046 --> 24:26.549
He and Vega are on the interview
up at Kern,

24:26.591 --> 24:28.801
wondered if we could
help out with Hobbs.

24:28.843 --> 24:30.636
Sunset and Las Palmas pan out?

24:30.678 --> 24:32.430
In the wind.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.807
Well, he won't go far.

24:34.849 --> 24:39.478
No. He'll be on a corner
with a coffee shop,

24:39.520 --> 24:42.106
a gas station and a long light.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.817
Hmm...

24:44.859 --> 24:47.320
You're going to look
for Brady violations.

24:47.361 --> 24:48.613
Do you know what those are?

24:48.654 --> 24:50.948
When prosecutors
withhold evidence?

24:50.990 --> 24:52.366
Good guess.

24:52.408 --> 24:55.286
Our Mr. Crow appears to be
a classic Brady.

24:55.328 --> 24:57.455
Pull the cases, Shepardize them,

24:57.496 --> 24:59.332
make sure they're
still good law.

24:59.373 --> 25:01.626
-So we are suing the D.A.?
-We are not.

25:01.667 --> 25:05.504
Prosecutors have immunity.
We are suing L.A. County.

25:07.423 --> 25:09.717
I'm on it.

25:11.385 --> 25:13.930
-Alicia Kent?
-10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.932
About when the warrant expires.
How'd she sound?

25:15.973 --> 25:17.808
-Frustrated.
-She may have texted

25:17.850 --> 25:19.101
her accomplice last night.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.479
Beautiful. Tell me J. Edgar's

25:21.520 --> 25:23.856
-making headway.
-Working it.

25:23.898 --> 25:25.191
I'm worried we're not
gonna have enough.

25:25.233 --> 25:27.068
So am I.

25:37.286 --> 25:41.123
-Bless you.
-Word to the wise?

25:41.165 --> 25:44.252
Say "bless you"
before you count the change.

25:44.293 --> 25:47.171
But if I don't count it, how do
I know they deserve a blessing?

25:47.213 --> 25:50.508
-Good point.
-Least I ain't naked.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.094
I so appreciate that.

25:53.135 --> 25:57.682
But, actually, I'm trying
to find Sean Terrion.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.893
-Any idea where he is?
-Nope.

26:00.935 --> 26:03.980
Hmm.

26:04.021 --> 26:07.066
How about I treat you
to a big, hot breakfast?

26:07.108 --> 26:11.028
Hmm? We'll try
to figure this out.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.823
I've gone through all the
hard drives and devices.

26:13.864 --> 26:15.992
Been at Computer Crimes
all morning.

26:16.033 --> 26:17.451
Nothing.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.161
The video's
got to be somewhere.

26:21.706 --> 26:23.541
Had a thought.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.043
Nobody's checked the LAN
at St. Ag's.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.671
-The LAN?
-Hospital's internal network.

26:28.713 --> 26:30.840
Kent had a workstation.

26:30.881 --> 26:33.217
Confidential patient records.

26:33.259 --> 26:37.054
You're gonna need a very, very
narrow warrant for that.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.932
Think I can write one,
now that I know where to look.

26:39.974 --> 26:42.601
Okay. I'll circle back. Thanks.

27:08.878 --> 27:10.880
(birds chirping)

27:16.844 --> 27:18.846
Hello?

27:41.619 --> 27:43.621
(fan whirring)

27:57.468 --> 27:59.261
(footstep nearby)

28:01.555 --> 28:04.183
You want to help me out here,
Mr. McMullen?

28:10.189 --> 28:13.401
LAPD. Detective Bosch.

28:13.442 --> 28:15.653
"The Lord hath beset my path.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.072
He hath set darknesses
in my way."

28:20.408 --> 28:22.201
Curious about that van
out there.

28:24.120 --> 28:28.207
Been a ride and a kennel
and extra beds.

28:28.249 --> 28:29.834
Mostly I pirate parts

28:29.875 --> 28:31.627
from it now,
keep the newer one running.

28:31.669 --> 28:33.421
Was it running in 2009?

28:33.462 --> 28:35.131
Surely.

28:37.508 --> 28:42.304
Remember a street kid,
girl named Daisy Clayton?

28:46.976 --> 28:49.270
She stayed here one night.

28:49.311 --> 28:52.898
-Next day, she was gone.
-You remembered her immediately.

28:52.940 --> 28:56.152
Lot of my children stay lost.

28:56.193 --> 28:57.820
Daisy was taken.

28:57.862 --> 29:00.239
But I was gratified.

29:00.281 --> 29:01.866
That she was taken?

29:01.907 --> 29:04.452
That I saved her before she was.

29:04.493 --> 29:06.495
If they agree

29:06.537 --> 29:09.331
to be baptized,
I offer them a meal and a bed,

29:09.373 --> 29:11.250
put their names up on the board.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.880
I give the key,
up to them what they do with it.

29:15.921 --> 29:20.801
Photographs are the ones who...
didn't make it.

29:25.306 --> 29:28.225
Who are now in yonder city,

29:28.267 --> 29:31.145
not made by hand.

29:31.187 --> 29:33.147
You know where she went
when she left here?

29:33.189 --> 29:37.526
Daisy called home, said someone
was on his way to get her.

29:37.568 --> 29:40.529
Next I hear, she's dead.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.575
Broke my heart.

29:46.243 --> 29:47.786
They never caught her killer.

29:52.416 --> 29:53.792
You think it was me?

29:53.834 --> 29:55.628
Help me prove it wasn't.

29:55.669 --> 29:59.256
Where you were that night,
where your van was.

29:59.298 --> 30:00.925
Ten years ago?

30:06.805 --> 30:09.141
Think hard.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.774
BARREL:
Seems to be a little confusion

30:16.815 --> 30:18.734
with the details, Teddy.

30:18.776 --> 30:20.236
CRATE:
You said

30:20.277 --> 30:24.782
the last time you saw Terrion
was Thursday.

30:24.823 --> 30:25.991
Mm...

30:26.033 --> 30:28.786
Yeah, that's right. Fry?

30:28.827 --> 30:31.789
No, thank you.

30:31.830 --> 30:35.751
You also said Friday, Saturday,

30:35.793 --> 30:37.920
and maybe Sunday.

30:37.962 --> 30:39.588
I don't wear a watch.

30:40.631 --> 30:43.008
Last year, you said,

30:43.050 --> 30:45.010
and I quote,

30:45.052 --> 30:49.223
"He's in my spot tomorrow?
Could be mayhem."

30:49.265 --> 30:51.100
Is that what happened?

30:51.141 --> 30:52.643
He took your spot?

30:57.565 --> 31:00.150
I didn't want to do it,
but goddamn it,

31:00.192 --> 31:01.360
it was my corner.

31:01.402 --> 31:03.153
Mine.

31:06.282 --> 31:10.160
And mayhem ensued.

31:11.745 --> 31:13.330
Sounds like it.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.708
Stand your ground, am I right?

31:15.749 --> 31:18.711
(door opens)

31:27.845 --> 31:29.471
He's all yours.

31:33.976 --> 31:38.480
To have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,

31:38.522 --> 31:42.818
for richer or for poorer.

31:42.860 --> 31:45.154
With this ring, I thee wed.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.329
I heard Crate and Barrel
did you a solid.

31:53.370 --> 31:55.789
-Uh, stole the case.
-Sneaky bastards.

31:55.831 --> 31:58.459
They'll never let you forget.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.294
(chuckles)
Word on the street is

32:00.336 --> 32:02.755
Crate and Barrel saved
your bacon. How's that feel?

32:02.796 --> 32:04.381
Nice.

32:04.423 --> 32:08.802
-You get the warrant?
-Yeah. Tomorrow, first thing.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.262
Come on, man,
that's cutting it close.

32:10.304 --> 32:11.722
She's coming at 10:00.

32:11.764 --> 32:14.183
Are we pinning too much
on this picture frame camera?

32:14.224 --> 32:15.726
I mean, could be nothing there.

32:15.768 --> 32:17.603
I think Stanley Kent
will come through for us.

32:17.645 --> 32:20.898
-From the grave?
-From the LAN at St. Ag's.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.608
Let me know if you
need any more help

32:22.650 --> 32:24.777
with that computer stuff, Jer.

32:24.818 --> 32:26.028
(phone ringing)

32:31.200 --> 32:32.868
Hey, Melissa.

32:32.910 --> 32:34.411
How's your dad?

32:34.453 --> 32:38.040
MELISSA:
He passed away an hour ago.

32:38.082 --> 32:41.251
Another heart attack.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.295
There's nothing they could do.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.553
(siren wailing)

32:57.768 --> 32:58.936
If, uh,

32:58.977 --> 33:02.106
if this guy ever
gives you any trouble...

33:02.147 --> 33:04.149
(all laugh)

33:06.276 --> 33:08.070
Jun, this is Bill Frank.

33:08.112 --> 33:09.947
Bill was my rabbi
in the department.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.740
So pleased to meet you.

33:11.782 --> 33:16.036
I understand you're to blame
for Irv's mayoral aspirations.

33:16.078 --> 33:18.038
Do you not think
he'll make a good mayor?

33:18.080 --> 33:22.209
On the contrary,
I think he'll be stupendous.

33:22.251 --> 33:24.128
So do I.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.671
Yeah, department's loss.

33:25.713 --> 33:29.133
City's gain, and it's
just what L.A. needs.

33:29.174 --> 33:30.342
So thank you.

33:30.384 --> 33:32.553
My pleasure.

33:36.849 --> 33:39.101
I love you.

33:45.816 --> 33:47.735
I love you, too.

34:18.307 --> 34:20.309
♪ ♪

34:28.776 --> 34:31.695

34:36.909 --> 34:39.620
Why isn't he meeting Avril
at his club?

34:39.661 --> 34:41.455
Half his business is legit.

34:41.497 --> 34:43.332
He'll string Hovan along
for a while,

34:43.373 --> 34:44.750
till he's sure.

34:44.792 --> 34:46.919
Sekou?

34:46.960 --> 34:49.087
Kreyol for rescue.

34:49.129 --> 34:51.632
-Total front?
-Semi-legit.

34:51.673 --> 34:53.342
Pockets some
of the contributions,

34:53.383 --> 34:54.760
rest goes to Haiti.

34:54.802 --> 34:57.471
ESPINOSA: Got to be one
of his laundries, too.

34:57.513 --> 35:00.808
Lots of small cash donations.

35:00.849 --> 35:04.228
CONNIFF:
What did Avril do
in the old country?

35:04.269 --> 35:06.980
Secret police.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.483
HOVAN:
What kind of real estate
we talking about?

35:09.525 --> 35:13.904
Apartment buildings,
convenience stores,

35:13.946 --> 35:17.324
nightclubs, pachinko parlors.

35:17.366 --> 35:19.493
(Avril chuckles)

35:19.535 --> 35:22.871
If you have a particular area
of interest...

35:22.913 --> 35:25.082
I'm looking long-term.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.543
Ah. Mais oui.

35:27.584 --> 35:29.795
Not worth doing otherwise.

35:29.837 --> 35:32.047
Hmm.

35:33.423 --> 35:35.217
And the fees?

35:35.259 --> 35:37.928
The fees are appropriate.

35:37.970 --> 35:39.388
One for one.

35:41.431 --> 35:43.225
Too steep.

35:43.267 --> 35:44.893
-Ah.
-Discount for volume?

35:46.436 --> 35:48.230
Say, one for three.

35:48.272 --> 35:50.607
(chuckles)

35:53.110 --> 35:56.697
It will depend on the size
of your investment.

35:56.738 --> 35:59.700
This works out?

35:59.741 --> 36:01.159
Substantial.

36:02.953 --> 36:07.666
I prefer to start modestly.

36:07.708 --> 36:10.544
See how things go.

36:13.463 --> 36:15.173
Mm-mm-mm.

36:26.393 --> 36:28.437
MADDIE:
Hey.

36:33.859 --> 36:36.486
I overheard you talking earlier.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.656
Rodgers?

36:55.047 --> 36:57.049
(birds chirping)

37:03.555 --> 37:05.974
(footsteps approaching)

37:07.976 --> 37:09.978
You're up early again.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.694
Keeping long hours.

37:17.736 --> 37:20.072
More case summaries.

37:20.113 --> 37:23.033
Chandler drives you pretty hard.

37:23.075 --> 37:26.036
Just another relentless
role model.

37:26.078 --> 37:28.538
Not sure how to take that.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.832
I meant it as a compliment.

37:30.874 --> 37:32.918
Don't idolize her too much,
Mads.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.921
She's using the law to make
a criminal into a millionaire

37:35.963 --> 37:37.756
while she lines her own pockets.

37:37.798 --> 37:41.009
Like there aren't any
criminal millionaires.

37:41.051 --> 37:43.220
Touché.

37:43.261 --> 37:46.098
-She did a good job for you.
-Amazing.

37:46.139 --> 37:47.808
Not denying she's good
at what she does--

37:47.849 --> 37:49.226
why I hired her.

37:49.267 --> 37:52.938
You can't lock people up
for crimes they didn't commit.

37:52.980 --> 37:54.898
Even guys like Dante Crow.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.149
Of course not.

37:56.191 --> 37:57.901
But what?

37:57.943 --> 37:59.695
He'll be back in orange
before he sees a dime.

38:03.073 --> 38:05.367
-You don't know that.
-I do.

38:11.707 --> 38:12.874
Big day?

38:12.916 --> 38:14.793
-Main event.
-Hmm.

38:14.835 --> 38:16.378
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

38:16.420 --> 38:19.631
-Love you.
-Love you.

38:24.011 --> 38:25.554
(door closes)

38:25.595 --> 38:27.597
(footsteps receding)

38:29.391 --> 38:30.767
Morning, Juan.

38:32.436 --> 38:34.479
Alicia Kent is here.

38:34.521 --> 38:36.231
Oh, shit.

38:36.273 --> 38:38.608
-She's early.
-I put her in
the interview room.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.277
All right, find Bosch.
Get him in here.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.611
(quietly):
All right.

38:47.701 --> 38:49.077
ROMO:
Servers are supposed to be

38:49.119 --> 38:51.288
for patient
or research purposes only.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.582
-No personal files.
-Which makes it
a good hiding place.

38:53.623 --> 38:55.417
(tapping keyboard)

38:55.459 --> 38:57.878
ROMO:
We monitor the systems.

38:59.755 --> 39:03.341
Still have to know
where to look.

39:11.141 --> 39:13.143
Gotcha.

39:18.398 --> 39:20.442
(phone vibrates)

39:22.819 --> 39:24.613
Fuck.

39:25.739 --> 39:27.365
(sighs)

39:30.202 --> 39:31.578
(knocking)

39:31.620 --> 39:34.164
Hi. I am sorry for the delay.

39:34.206 --> 39:37.334
Can I get you anything?
Like coffee?

39:37.375 --> 39:39.336
No, thank you.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.463
-How much longer?
-Oh, just a few minutes.

39:41.505 --> 39:43.423
We're getting the paperwork
together.

39:43.465 --> 39:45.217
Are you sure I can't
get you anything?

39:45.258 --> 39:46.343
Get me out of here.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.928
We're working on it.

39:47.969 --> 39:49.387
I promise.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.225
Listen, I know
that this has been

39:53.266 --> 39:54.643
a grueling experience for you.

39:54.684 --> 39:55.894
Extremely.

39:55.936 --> 39:58.355
So if there's anything
that we can do to help...

39:58.396 --> 40:00.190
Actually, since I'm here...

40:00.232 --> 40:02.067
Yes?

40:02.109 --> 40:03.735
I'd like to lodge a complaint.

40:03.777 --> 40:04.861
About...?

40:04.903 --> 40:06.446
Your Detective Bosch.

40:12.953 --> 40:15.705
Do you mind if I record this?

40:15.747 --> 40:19.376
-Is it necessary?
-Well, it protects everyone.

40:19.417 --> 40:20.627
(beeps)

40:20.669 --> 40:23.463
Lieutenant Grace Billets
with Alicia Kent

40:23.505 --> 40:26.967
at 9:36 a.m., June 22.

40:27.008 --> 40:29.344
So what about Bosch?

40:29.386 --> 40:31.346
He called my insurance company.

40:31.388 --> 40:34.558
He told them to hold off
on paying out Stan's policy.

40:34.599 --> 40:38.979
Well, that's procedure
with a homicide case.

40:39.020 --> 40:41.982
I was assured by Agent Brenner
that this case was closed.

40:42.023 --> 40:44.025
Your detective clearly
didn't get the memo,

40:44.067 --> 40:45.652
and apparently, neither did you.

40:45.694 --> 40:48.238
It's not the FBI's case,
it's ours.

40:48.280 --> 40:52.492
And Bosch can be annoying
but it comes from a good place.

40:52.534 --> 40:54.202
Right.

40:57.831 --> 40:59.499
Can I please have
my husband's property?

40:59.541 --> 41:01.376
-Of course.
-(beeps)

41:01.418 --> 41:03.503
The paperwork should be ready
by now.

41:03.545 --> 41:04.963
Apologies.

41:05.005 --> 41:06.715
I'll be right back.

41:09.843 --> 41:11.803
-You said 10:00.
-She showed up early.

41:11.845 --> 41:15.557
-Did you find it?
-Video from the night, yeah.

41:15.599 --> 41:17.893
Just got to scroll through
to find the moment of truth.

41:23.523 --> 41:25.567
Showtime.

41:25.609 --> 41:27.027
Is there anything?

41:28.653 --> 41:31.448
I know it's here.
I just have to find it.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.116
BILLETS:
Hope to God it is.

41:33.158 --> 41:35.160
Let's do it.

41:51.551 --> 41:52.510
Mrs. Kent.

41:52.552 --> 41:54.179
Detective.

41:54.221 --> 41:55.972
Detective Bosch
would like to tell you

41:56.014 --> 41:57.474
-his side of the story.
-(beeps)

41:57.515 --> 42:00.143
Detective Harry Bosch
joins the conversation

42:00.185 --> 42:02.479
9:51 a.m.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.981
Do you have my husband's
belongings?

42:05.023 --> 42:07.025
I do.

42:10.153 --> 42:14.449
First, if I can explain...
my way of working.

42:14.491 --> 42:16.993
I'm not asking for an apology.

42:17.035 --> 42:21.081
I want you to return my property
and stay the hell away from me.

42:21.122 --> 42:22.207
I... (chuckles)

42:22.249 --> 42:23.458
I understand.

42:25.293 --> 42:28.213
Look, sometimes,

42:28.255 --> 42:30.799
closing a case, we can get
a little lost in the weeds...

42:30.840 --> 42:32.968
uh, tunnel vision.

42:33.009 --> 42:36.554
You want to tie up every
loose end; sometimes you can't.

42:36.596 --> 42:40.308
For example: y-you remember
when I took your robe

42:40.350 --> 42:42.310
out of the closet
and I gave it to you, right?

42:42.352 --> 42:44.938
-Yes.
-Right.

42:48.650 --> 42:52.779
But... but you can see
in the photo,

42:52.821 --> 42:54.823
there it is on the chair.

42:54.864 --> 42:56.616
After they took the picture,
they must have hung it up

42:56.658 --> 42:57.826
in the closet.

43:00.245 --> 43:01.204
They must have.

43:01.246 --> 43:03.206
Eh, fair enough.

43:11.840 --> 43:15.510
Text you sent
middle of last night.

43:15.552 --> 43:17.095
Unknown number.

43:17.137 --> 43:19.639
You tapped my phone.

43:19.681 --> 43:21.433
We have a warrant.

43:24.227 --> 43:26.479
Who'd you reach out to,
Mrs. Kent?

43:26.521 --> 43:30.191
This is outrageous.

43:30.233 --> 43:32.027
You people don't know
when to stop.

43:32.068 --> 43:33.236
(knocking)

43:33.278 --> 43:34.612
(beeps)

43:34.654 --> 43:36.990
Sorry to interrupt.

43:37.032 --> 43:38.408
Please, sit down, Mrs. Kent.

43:42.912 --> 43:44.706
(Alicia sighs)

43:47.834 --> 43:49.461
Your husband...

43:49.502 --> 43:52.630
had a motion-activated
spy camera in a picture frame.

43:52.672 --> 43:55.050
It was working,
night of his murder.

43:58.553 --> 44:00.972
♪ ♪

44:07.103 --> 44:08.646
Check the time stamp.

44:10.857 --> 44:13.693
This was taken when you were
supposedly tied up,

44:13.735 --> 44:15.153
facedown on your bed.

44:32.337 --> 44:34.923
I want my lawyer.

44:48.770 --> 44:50.772
Looks good.

45:05.036 --> 45:06.746
-MANKIEWICZ: Hey, guys.
-Yeah?

45:06.788 --> 45:08.498
Mrs. Kent's attorney is here.

45:08.540 --> 45:09.874
Send him back, please.

45:09.916 --> 45:11.751
On the way.

45:17.257 --> 45:18.675
Detectives.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.927
EDGAR:
Ms. Chandler.

45:22.846 --> 45:25.765
Now, where's my client?
