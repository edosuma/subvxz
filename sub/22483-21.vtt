00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
♪ ♪

00:08.000 --> 00:10.333
I have a little something
for you, dear.

00:10.417 --> 00:11.959
Why? Oh, wait,

00:12.041 --> 00:14.375
did I tell you today was
some sort of Mexican holiday?

00:14.458 --> 00:17.000
Because I make up a ton of those
to get out of things.

00:17.083 --> 00:19.041
No, I caught on to that
a long time ago.

00:19.125 --> 00:22.083
Oh, thank you notes.
50 of them.

00:22.166 --> 00:23.792
Well, 49, actually.

00:23.875 --> 00:25.166
I put one aside

00:25.250 --> 00:27.834
so you can thank me
for the thank you notes.

00:27.917 --> 00:28.959
I don't understand.

00:29.041 --> 00:30.792
People are asking me

00:30.875 --> 00:32.875
if you received

00:30.875 --> 00:32.875
their wedding gifts,

00:32.959 --> 00:35.667
because they never received

00:32.959 --> 00:35.667
your thank you notes.

00:35.750 --> 00:38.041
Oh, this is a hint.

00:38.125 --> 00:41.792
No, no, uh, the last box

00:38.125 --> 00:41.792
of cards I gave you was a hint.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.500
Now I'm begging you.

00:44.583 --> 00:46.917
But only if you feel the urge.

00:48.458 --> 00:49.625
(groans)

00:49.709 --> 00:51.834
I thought we had a year

00:49.709 --> 00:51.834
to write thank you cards.

00:51.917 --> 00:53.792
No, they have a year

00:51.917 --> 00:53.792
to give us a gift.

00:53.875 --> 00:55.959
But we are supposed to write

00:53.875 --> 00:55.959
a thank you note right away,

00:56.041 --> 00:57.542
so they know their gift arrived.

00:57.625 --> 00:58.792
What is that?

00:57.625 --> 00:58.792
What voice are you doing?

00:58.875 --> 01:00.250
Just some dumb person

00:58.875 --> 01:00.250
who says dumb things.

01:00.333 --> 01:02.250
-Okay.

01:00.333 --> 01:02.250
-We have to do this.

01:02.333 --> 01:04.542
Right, no, you're right, it's

01:02.333 --> 01:04.542
important to show appreciation.

01:04.625 --> 01:06.709
No, we have a surrogate

01:04.625 --> 01:06.709
who's about to be pregnant

01:06.792 --> 01:08.709
with our baby; we need gifts.

01:08.792 --> 01:10.041
We can't have people mad at us,

01:10.125 --> 01:11.792
especially when most

01:10.125 --> 01:11.792
of the stuff

01:11.875 --> 01:13.875
on the registry

01:11.875 --> 01:13.875
are just gifts for us.

01:13.959 --> 01:16.667
Why did you start a registry?

01:13.959 --> 01:16.667
We don't have a baby yet.

01:16.750 --> 01:19.667
That doesn't change the fact

01:16.750 --> 01:19.667
that I'm gonna need a Waterpik.

01:19.750 --> 01:21.542
Okay. Okay.

01:21.625 --> 01:22.959
So, what if we do

01:23.041 --> 01:26.041
one thank you for everyone,

01:23.041 --> 01:26.041
like, like, a fun video

01:26.125 --> 01:28.083
that they can just watch

01:26.125 --> 01:28.083
over and over again?

01:28.166 --> 01:32.041
Yeah, that's so much better,

01:28.166 --> 01:32.041
because videos last forever.

01:32.834 --> 01:35.208
I know that from experience.

01:37.875 --> 01:39.875
MATT:
Hello, family, friends.

01:39.959 --> 01:43.500
It's us, America's sweethearts,
Colleen and Matt.

01:43.583 --> 01:45.417
You may be wondering why
we're surrounded

01:45.500 --> 01:48.500
by cookware, flatware
and several used gift cards.

01:48.583 --> 01:51.542
That's because these are all
of the amazing wedding gifts

01:51.625 --> 01:53.041
you've given us.

01:53.125 --> 01:55.041
Perhaps you even
recognize yours.

01:55.125 --> 01:57.834
If that's the case,
this video's for you.

01:57.917 --> 02:00.083
MATT: <i>And please, if you don't</i>

01:57.917 --> 02:00.083
<i>see your gift here,</i>

02:00.166 --> 02:02.875
<i>don't worry, many were</i>

02:00.166 --> 02:02.875
<i>exchanged for cash.</i>

02:02.959 --> 02:05.041
COLLEEN:

02:02.959 --> 02:05.041
<i>So thank you all so very much</i>

02:05.125 --> 02:08.125
<i>for making us feel so loved</i>

02:05.125 --> 02:08.125
<i>and so appreciated.</i>

02:08.208 --> 02:09.625
MATT:

02:08.208 --> 02:09.625
<i>And please, share this video</i>

02:09.709 --> 02:11.792
<i>with anyone you know</i>

02:09.709 --> 02:11.792
<i>who did give us a gift,</i>

02:11.875 --> 02:13.792
<i>but who is not CC'd above.</i>

02:13.875 --> 02:17.291
<i>But don't you dare reply all,</i>

02:13.875 --> 02:17.291
<i>'cause that's super annoying.</i>

02:17.375 --> 02:19.250
Okay, does anybody else

02:19.333 --> 02:22.500
feel like Matt and Colleen

02:19.333 --> 02:22.500
just took a big dump on them?

02:22.583 --> 02:24.750
You know, the real question is:

02:22.583 --> 02:24.750
who got them that camera?

02:24.834 --> 02:26.375
-You're the problem.

02:24.834 --> 02:26.375
-We did.

02:26.458 --> 02:28.083
Oh? I'm glad they used it.

02:28.166 --> 02:30.625
Wait, so people who gave

02:28.166 --> 02:30.625
big gifts are just lumped in

02:30.709 --> 02:32.667
with people who gave,

02:30.709 --> 02:32.667
like, a candle?

02:32.750 --> 02:33.875
What did you get them?

02:33.959 --> 02:36.417
An ancient Inuit heart

02:33.959 --> 02:36.417
carved out of walrus tusk,

02:36.500 --> 02:38.500
which in native cultures

02:36.500 --> 02:38.500
represents eternity.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.458
-We got it at Marshalls.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.458
-Mm-hmm.

02:44.583 --> 02:47.417
Uh, can someone please

02:44.583 --> 02:47.417
pass the potatoes?

02:47.500 --> 02:50.000
Mm. Yeah, here you go.

02:50.083 --> 02:53.041
Thank you, Sam.

02:53.125 --> 02:55.000
You're welcome.

02:55.083 --> 02:57.041
I passed the potatoes.

02:57.125 --> 03:00.375
Oh, yeah, but, about a year ago,
Sam passed me some potatoes,

03:00.458 --> 03:02.166
and I never thanked her for it.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.875
In fact, let me just do a-a
blanket thank you to everyone,

03:04.959 --> 03:06.667
uh, for anything they might have

03:06.750 --> 03:10.500
or might not have done to help
me get food into my mouth hole.

03:10.583 --> 03:12.917
My thanks. And Jen's.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.458
I think this is about our video.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.583
You got something
you want to say to me, Greg?

03:16.667 --> 03:18.500
Yeah, because if you do,
you know, you can just make

03:18.583 --> 03:20.625
another video, and then just
send it out to the whole family.

03:20.709 --> 03:23.250
Wait, are people
seriously upset about this?

03:23.333 --> 03:25.667
That's what we do,
Uncle Matt, we judge.

03:25.750 --> 03:28.458
It's lovely that you took
the time to thank the family.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.125
But I think perhaps
a group message, uh,

03:31.208 --> 03:33.125
feels a little impersonal,

03:33.208 --> 03:35.625
and perhaps something
only a monster would do.

03:35.709 --> 03:36.709
TIM:
Yeah.

03:36.792 --> 03:38.792
How could you?
(mouthing)

03:38.875 --> 03:40.834
Joan, is this because I didn't
use the note cards you gave me?

03:40.917 --> 03:42.917
Because I can go back to that
store that I returned them to,

03:43.000 --> 03:44.083
and buy them again.

03:44.166 --> 03:45.166
MATT:
Wait, come on, you guys.

03:45.250 --> 03:46.792
Handwritten notes are
so old-fashioned, right?

03:46.875 --> 03:47.834
COLLEEN:
Yeah.

03:47.917 --> 03:49.417
What? No, that's not true.

03:49.500 --> 03:52.709
No, every week, I write Joan
a thank you note for brunch.

03:52.792 --> 03:54.709
So you're the reason
we keep having these?

03:54.792 --> 03:56.125
This is crazy.

03:56.208 --> 03:59.250
So, we have to thank people
for every little thing now?

03:59.333 --> 04:01.166
Oh, yeah, smart.
Turn it on them.

04:01.250 --> 04:02.625
MATT:
Okay, fine.

04:02.709 --> 04:04.917
Fine. Jen, thank you
for the bagels.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.375
-Feels pointed.
-Sam,

04:06.458 --> 04:07.500
thank you for not busting me

04:07.583 --> 04:09.166
when I double dipped.
Tyler and Clementine,

04:09.250 --> 04:10.208
you're both good kids;
thanks for,

04:10.291 --> 04:11.458
you know, scoring me
that thing for me

04:11.542 --> 04:12.875
that I can't talk
about but we all know

04:12.959 --> 04:14.250
what I'm talking about.

04:14.333 --> 04:16.166
Timmy, thank you
for always having my back.

04:16.250 --> 04:17.500
Heather, thank you for being

04:17.583 --> 04:21.125
the best big sister
that a guy could ever ask for.

04:22.667 --> 04:24.125
And, Greg, thank you very much

04:24.208 --> 04:26.625
for helping me out after
my divorce, man, really.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.208
Mom and Dad, thank you,

04:30.291 --> 04:33.083
for thousands of dollars,

04:33.166 --> 04:36.667
and thousands of hours of love.

04:38.792 --> 04:39.834
Okay.

04:39.917 --> 04:41.667
Is everyone happy?

04:41.750 --> 04:44.709
I'd still like mine in writing.

04:50.166 --> 04:52.291
Okay.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.291
You want anything else, Soph?

04:54.375 --> 04:57.083
Yeah. I'd like to get
the top of my ear pierced.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.542
Oh, not again.

04:58.625 --> 05:01.083
Listen, you are
way too young for that piercing.

05:01.166 --> 05:03.959
But you always tell me
to express my true self.

05:04.041 --> 05:06.083
And my true self is like
that pretty bartender

05:06.166 --> 05:07.875
at The Cheesecake Factory.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.125
Honey, he cannot be
your role model.

05:10.208 --> 05:11.709
But you let Samantha do it.

05:11.792 --> 05:13.375
Because they like me better.

05:13.458 --> 05:15.709
That's not true.
We like whoever isn't here best.

05:15.792 --> 05:18.000
Where <i>is </i>good old Tyler?

05:18.083 --> 05:20.834
Samantha had to wait
until she was 15, okay?

05:20.917 --> 05:22.625
So let it go.

05:22.709 --> 05:25.208
Okay, if you can explain
to me the difference

05:25.291 --> 05:28.333
between this part of my ear
and this part of my ear.

05:28.417 --> 05:29.542
All right, Tim,
you take that one.

05:29.625 --> 05:30.750
You're the ear doctor.

05:30.834 --> 05:33.041
All right.
This is connective tissue,

05:33.125 --> 05:35.792
and this is trashy
to have pierced.

05:35.875 --> 05:39.333
It's a baseless, arbitrary
distinction, and we all know it.

05:39.417 --> 05:41.750
Oh, my God, she is, like,
a professional arguer.

05:41.834 --> 05:44.375
You know, I mean, if that were,
like, a real job.

05:44.458 --> 05:46.291
She's been doing
mock trials at school.

05:46.375 --> 05:48.709
You should see her practicing
with her stuffed animals.

05:48.792 --> 05:51.542
She argued Mr. Pickle
out of the death penalty.

05:51.625 --> 05:53.166
And they had DNA.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.166
Is it too late to teach
her that being pretty

05:55.250 --> 05:57.333
is better than being smart?

05:58.583 --> 06:01.166
Did you think
I wasn't gonna find out?

06:01.250 --> 06:02.583
Find out what?

06:02.667 --> 06:04.000
You didn't let Sam
pierce her ear

06:04.083 --> 06:05.291
because she was 15,

06:05.375 --> 06:06.583
you let Sam get her ear pierced

06:06.667 --> 06:08.667
because she got straight A's.

06:08.750 --> 06:10.375
-Tim?
-What?

06:10.458 --> 06:11.917
I'm alone with her
in the kitchen.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.458
-I need backup.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:13.542 --> 06:16.333
I just got straight A's,
so I'll go start the car.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.041
Oh.

06:18.125 --> 06:20.417
What? No, no, no, no, no, no.

06:20.500 --> 06:24.041
Listen, we are thinking
about it, okay, Sophia?

06:24.125 --> 06:26.458
Well, I know from experience,
that's a future yes.

06:26.542 --> 06:29.083
So can't we just save our energy
and get right to it?

06:29.166 --> 06:30.875
No, it's not always
a future yes.

06:30.959 --> 06:32.834
I mean, I asked your Mom
about something last night,

06:32.917 --> 06:35.583
and she said she'd think about
it; it turned out to be a no.

06:35.667 --> 06:37.083
Sometimes the best you got is

06:37.166 --> 06:40.166
you got to just go online
and watch videos of girls

06:40.250 --> 06:42.917
getting their ears pierced
over and over again.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.333
It's not as good
as doing it yourself, but...

06:45.417 --> 06:47.834
(chuckles):
sometimes that's all we got.

06:47.917 --> 06:49.834
Okay, well, mock trial taught us

06:49.917 --> 06:52.458
that a "no" without
a sound argument behind it

06:52.542 --> 06:55.125
is simply an invitation
for further debate.

06:55.208 --> 06:56.583
I accept your invitation

06:56.667 --> 06:59.000
and will see you soon.

06:59.083 --> 07:00.875
See, Heather, if you
let me give her the keys,

07:00.959 --> 07:02.333
we wouldn't be
in this position.

07:02.417 --> 07:05.041
Okay, th-that's not, no... ugh.

07:07.750 --> 07:11.208
Hey, Jen, hi.
So, you're a lawyer.

07:11.291 --> 07:13.667
Still the one thing
I wish I never told you.

07:13.750 --> 07:16.625
Well, Sophia is doing
mock trial for school,

07:16.709 --> 07:18.917
and she would love to have
a real lawyer to, you know,

07:19.000 --> 07:20.542
practice her arguments with.

07:20.625 --> 07:22.500
She was just too scared
to ask you.

07:22.583 --> 07:24.250
Oh, I love it when
people are afraid of me.

07:24.333 --> 07:25.375
What's the topic?

07:25.458 --> 07:26.667
Body mutilation.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.041
Yeah, she's got the affirmative,

07:28.125 --> 07:29.583
so you would need
to take the negative,

07:29.667 --> 07:31.375
and just really, you know,
just... (imitates explosion)

07:31.458 --> 07:33.125
Full-court press.
Yeah, no mercy.

07:33.208 --> 07:35.125
Yeah, I wouldn't say
try to make her cry, but...

07:35.208 --> 07:36.333
-Well, you know.
-Wow, embarrassing

07:36.417 --> 07:37.959
-if you lost, huh?
-(laughter)

07:38.041 --> 07:39.834
-I won't lose.
-HEATHER: Ah.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.333
If one person in the family,

07:42.417 --> 07:45.583
like, say, Samantha,
gets to have a second piercing,

07:45.667 --> 07:47.250
the same rules should apply

07:47.333 --> 07:49.667
to any other person
in the family.

07:49.750 --> 07:51.208
It's called precedent.

07:51.291 --> 07:54.291
Sophia, is it true
that earlier today at brunch,

07:54.375 --> 07:57.458
you called Samantha,
and I quote, "a dummy"?

07:57.542 --> 08:00.500
I believe I called her
a "dumb, dumb dummy."

08:00.583 --> 08:02.125
I stand corrected.

08:02.208 --> 08:05.333
But still, why would you want
to model yourself after,

08:05.417 --> 08:08.542
and again, quoting,
"a dumb, dumb dummy"?

08:09.500 --> 08:11.083
You know what, Aunt Jen?

08:11.166 --> 08:13.166
You're right.
That is a smart point.

08:13.250 --> 08:15.000
So maybe Samantha

08:15.083 --> 08:17.917
isn't the best person
to build your whole case around.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.500
You're right again.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.709
I should be more careful
about who I model myself after.

08:22.792 --> 08:25.375
Defense rests.
I have no further questions.

08:25.458 --> 08:29.917
I do. Would you be okay
if I modeled myself after you?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.333
Oh, I'd be
very flattered by that.

08:31.417 --> 08:32.875
And I could put you
in touch with people

08:32.959 --> 08:33.917
who have done the same.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.625
So when did you get
your nose pierced?

08:38.917 --> 08:40.250
Oh, um...

08:40.333 --> 08:42.458
That <i>is </i>a stud
in your nose, isn't it?

08:42.542 --> 08:44.125
(laughs)
Well, actually, it's...

08:44.208 --> 08:45.792
And what age were you
when you got that piercing?

08:45.875 --> 08:47.667
That is i-irrelevant.

08:47.750 --> 08:49.250
Exactly my point.

08:49.333 --> 08:50.667
Age doesn't matter.

08:50.750 --> 08:52.250
I rest my case.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.333
Well, that is
an airtight argument.

08:54.417 --> 08:55.959
High five, sister.

08:56.041 --> 08:58.542
She wins. I'm gonna go
get some more hash browns.

08:58.625 --> 09:01.291
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
How could you lose?

09:01.375 --> 09:04.166
Consider yourself lucky
she even asked you.

09:04.250 --> 09:07.709
Oh, and I did it myself with
a needle at a slumber party.

09:07.792 --> 09:09.041
Dad, Mom,

09:09.125 --> 09:10.667
could I have
a slumber party tonight?

09:10.750 --> 09:13.667
-Yes.
-No, no, no.

09:13.750 --> 09:16.875
Thank you so much for staying
open late for us, Stacey.

09:16.959 --> 09:18.125
Come sit.

09:18.208 --> 09:19.709
I'm so excited.

09:19.792 --> 09:22.625
Oh, my God, she is so young.
I can't watch, I can't watch it.

09:22.709 --> 09:24.375
Hey, if you don't want her
to do it,

09:24.458 --> 09:26.041
then why don't you just do
what my uncle-dad did?

09:26.125 --> 09:28.250
You know, when I wanted
a tattoo of Tweety Bird doing

09:28.333 --> 09:30.083
a bong rip, right here
on my pubic bone,

09:30.166 --> 09:33.917
he got it first, and I was like,
"Uh, yeah, no, thank you."

09:35.166 --> 09:36.709
Yeah...

09:36.792 --> 09:37.834
(ear piercer clicks)

09:37.917 --> 09:39.041
(screams)

09:39.125 --> 09:40.917
So, pretty cool, right?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.500
It's your turn, Sophia.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.917
Actually,
I'm having second thoughts.

09:48.125 --> 09:50.375
I think I'll get
my belly button pierced instead.

09:50.458 --> 09:53.875
Stacey! Going back in.

10:03.041 --> 10:05.333
I'm sorry.
I saw you when I was ordering

10:05.417 --> 10:06.750
and just had to come over.

10:06.834 --> 10:08.041
Let me stop you right there.

10:08.125 --> 10:10.166
I have all the Girl Scout
Cookies I can eat.

10:10.250 --> 10:12.333
No, I'm actually
a local talent agent,

10:12.417 --> 10:14.834
and I think
you have a great look.

10:14.917 --> 10:16.417
Is this the kind of compliment

10:16.500 --> 10:18.625
where I have to say something
nice back to you?

10:18.709 --> 10:20.875
Because I got nothing.

10:20.959 --> 10:24.083
No, I'm wondering if you've ever
thought about modeling.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.917
Oh, uh, I got too much to do
to think about modeling.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.166
Ooh, what time is it?

10:28.250 --> 10:30.583
I got to pick up
my granddaughter at 2:30.

10:30.667 --> 10:31.709
It's 9:00 a.m.

10:31.792 --> 10:34.291
Oh. Right.

10:34.375 --> 10:36.667
Well, if you are interested,
stuff comes up all the time.

10:36.750 --> 10:37.792
I actually have a client

10:37.875 --> 10:39.458
shooting an ad this weekend

10:39.542 --> 10:40.917
that you'd be perfect for.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.542
Am I gonna get there
and it's all nude stuff?

10:43.625 --> 10:45.625
No, you just have to sit there
and look handsome,

10:45.709 --> 10:47.208
which shouldn't be hard for you.

10:47.291 --> 10:49.542
For a guy your age,
you really fill out

10:49.625 --> 10:51.250
those T-shirt sleeves.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.208
JOHN:
Hey.

10:54.291 --> 10:56.291
We got any cucumber water?

10:56.375 --> 10:59.250
Oh. Hey, Dad.
No, I made you a mai tai.

10:59.333 --> 11:02.125
I had a couple sips
of it, so I... mm.

11:02.208 --> 11:03.500
Yeah, I'm gonna
make you another one.

11:03.583 --> 11:06.333
Oh, I better not.
I-I got a photo shoot tomorrow.

11:06.417 --> 11:07.375
GREG:
A photo shoot, huh?

11:07.458 --> 11:10.125
You getting a new Costco card,
or...?

11:10.208 --> 11:13.083
No, dear, he's got
a modeling job.

11:13.166 --> 11:16.417
I mean, with those looks,
I'm amazed it took so long.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.875
That's great, Dad. It could be
a new career for you.

11:18.959 --> 11:22.250
Yeah, well, sure, you know,
I could be the new Marlboro Man.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.500
Yeah.
After the last four died

11:24.583 --> 11:27.000
of that mysterious,
unexplained illness.

11:27.083 --> 11:28.625
I bet it was the cigarettes.

11:28.709 --> 11:30.417
JOHN:
Well, it should be a fun ride.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.834
My agent Hillary
thinks it could be

11:32.917 --> 11:35.583
a quick climb to the top.

11:35.667 --> 11:37.458
(camera clicking)

11:37.542 --> 11:39.208
Mr. Short, you're doing great.

11:39.291 --> 11:41.542
I thought the Riding Lift was
a weight bench or something.

11:41.625 --> 11:43.041
No, no.

11:43.125 --> 11:45.625
It's the premier mobility system
for the greatest generation.

11:45.709 --> 11:47.291
We give people
their upstairs back.

11:47.375 --> 11:50.875
You know what would really sell
it is me jogging in front of it.

11:50.959 --> 11:53.625
No, no, that's how the last
guy died. Now smile, John.

11:53.709 --> 11:55.834
Like at the top of the stairs,
you're gonna get hot soup

11:55.917 --> 11:57.333
or a-a phone call
from your kids.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.917
I don't want either one of
those; I just want to go home.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.333
Oh, that's it.

12:01.417 --> 12:02.792
Like you're looking
into the abyss.

12:02.875 --> 12:04.917
Great. A little more drool.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.083
Like your bones hurt.

12:08.875 --> 12:12.333
JOAN:
"Your story doesn't have

12:08.875 --> 12:12.333
to end at the first story."

12:12.417 --> 12:14.458
Well, that's very clever.

12:14.542 --> 12:15.750
-It's garbage.
-Mm, yeah.

12:15.834 --> 12:17.166
Uh, yeah.
It's a thinker.

12:17.250 --> 12:18.959
I was trying to be nice.

12:19.041 --> 12:20.125
No, not the ad, Joanie. Me.

12:20.208 --> 12:21.834
It makes me look
like an old man.

12:21.917 --> 12:24.667
I'm just glad they didn't
use the one of me drooling.

12:24.750 --> 12:26.750
It's just a job, honey.

12:26.834 --> 12:29.375
It was depressing.
I just wanted something to do,

12:29.458 --> 12:31.166
something I could be proud of.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.041
Oh, I'm proud
of so much of what you do.

12:34.125 --> 12:36.458
Can we go somewhere with stairs?

12:36.542 --> 12:38.750
-The house has stairs.
-No, I know,

12:38.834 --> 12:41.917
but I-I want people
to see me using them.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.542
I'm sorry.

12:43.625 --> 12:46.583
You know, I-I thought
there would be stairs here.

12:46.667 --> 12:49.792
You don't realize how flat
most coffee shops are.

12:49.875 --> 12:52.500
You think people saw me
stepping up on that curb?

12:52.583 --> 12:54.583
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah. Hmm.

12:54.667 --> 12:56.959
Uh, when you go up and down
the curb that many times,

12:57.041 --> 12:58.709
-people tend to notice.
-Mm.

12:58.792 --> 13:00.000
(phone vibrating)

13:00.083 --> 13:01.625
Dear, I think you're sitting
on your phone again.

13:01.709 --> 13:03.333
Oh. It's Hillary.

13:03.417 --> 13:05.709
Nah, no way.
I'm not talking to her.

13:05.792 --> 13:07.291
-Are you sure?
-Mm-hmm.

13:07.375 --> 13:09.834
Well, maybe the next job
would be for soft ice cream.

13:09.917 --> 13:12.917
With my luck, they'll
give me a catheter spread.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.458
-(chuckles)
-But, you know,

13:13.000 --> 13:14.458
that might pay extra,

13:14.542 --> 13:16.458
because it's above
the knee nudity.

13:16.542 --> 13:18.250
(laughs):
Oh, stop.

13:18.333 --> 13:19.959
Hey, do I know you?

13:20.041 --> 13:22.875
Are you from Squadron 306?

13:22.959 --> 13:24.166
No.

13:24.250 --> 13:27.291
Were you buying a tomato
in the grocery store yesterday?

13:27.375 --> 13:28.917
No.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.959
Then we don't know each other.

13:31.041 --> 13:33.959
Oh, wait a minute.
You're the Riding Lift guy.

13:34.083 --> 13:35.542
Oh, you saw his ad!

13:35.625 --> 13:37.083
Yeah, I bought one.

13:37.166 --> 13:39.417
When I saw a rugged fella like
this using it,

13:39.500 --> 13:41.291
I wasn't embarrassed anymore.

13:41.375 --> 13:44.208
(chuckles):
Well, it's always nice

13:41.375 --> 13:44.208
to meet a fan.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.166
I can't wait to go
home and tell my wife

13:46.250 --> 13:47.959
I met the Riding Lift guy!

13:48.041 --> 13:50.750
And now I can actually
go upstairs and see her.

13:50.834 --> 13:53.625
You sure you don't want
to keep modeling?

13:53.709 --> 13:55.667
-Eh. Hmm?
-(phone vibrating)

13:56.917 --> 13:59.083
Hillary. Go for John.

13:59.166 --> 14:00.709
-(man grunts)
-Oh!

14:00.792 --> 14:03.583
That nice man
just fell off the curb.

14:05.250 --> 14:07.125
(camera clicking)

14:07.208 --> 14:08.166
-Looking good, John.
-(monitor beeping)

14:08.250 --> 14:09.583
Yeah, get tight on the bicep.

14:09.667 --> 14:12.375
I'm really getting this
blood pressure cuff beeping.

14:12.458 --> 14:13.959
Oh, cool!

14:14.041 --> 14:16.500
Now it's telling me
to call 1-1-6.

14:16.583 --> 14:18.208
I think you're looking at it
upside down.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.333
-What?
-It's telling you to call 9-1-1.

14:20.417 --> 14:21.709
John, your blood pressure's
through the roof.

14:21.792 --> 14:23.125
We should take you
to a hospital.

14:23.208 --> 14:26.125
Yeah. After you get the shot.

14:26.208 --> 14:28.000
(monitor beeping faster)

14:28.083 --> 14:30.083
He's good. (laughs)

14:39.417 --> 14:42.375
(groaning)

14:42.458 --> 14:45.667
Oh. I drank too much.

14:45.750 --> 14:47.375
Oh.

14:47.458 --> 14:50.166
Oh, I drank too much
and I am so hungover.

14:50.250 --> 14:51.792
Oh, me, too.

14:51.875 --> 14:55.667
That preschool fund-raising
auction was insane.

14:55.750 --> 14:58.208
Mm-hmm. Did I do something
to embarrass myself?

14:58.291 --> 15:00.542
I didn't do anything stupid,
did I, babe?

15:00.625 --> 15:03.542
No, honey. No. You just...
you did a dance for everyone.

15:03.625 --> 15:05.542
-What?
-You fashion-policed

15:03.625 --> 15:05.542
all of their outfits.

15:05.625 --> 15:07.917
-Oh...
-And then, when we

15:05.625 --> 15:07.917
walked all the way home,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.875
you did a comedy routine
with the mailbox.

15:10.959 --> 15:13.458
-It was awesome.
It was really funny.

15:10.959 --> 15:13.458
-It does sound good.

15:13.542 --> 15:14.875
What is in my mouth?

15:14.959 --> 15:16.291
Ah!

15:16.375 --> 15:18.125
Is that my lung?

15:18.208 --> 15:20.834
Oh, no.
No, I'm remembering now.

15:20.917 --> 15:22.583
That's chewing tobacco.

15:22.667 --> 15:25.291
Yeah, you made us stop and get
it, and then you were yelling

15:25.375 --> 15:28.583
how you were a baseball player,
and you threw a rock at our car.

15:28.667 --> 15:30.458
-There's hair in it.
-Ugh.

15:30.542 --> 15:31.917
LARK:
Mommy, I'm hungry!

15:32.000 --> 15:33.458
(both groan)

15:33.542 --> 15:36.875
-Honey, can you go get her
some cereal?

15:33.542 --> 15:36.875
-What?!

15:36.959 --> 15:39.500
No. I'm just as
hungover as you are.

15:39.583 --> 15:42.333
No. Whoever gets out
of bed first.

15:42.417 --> 15:45.125
(grunts)

15:45.208 --> 15:48.083
Uh-oh. It sounds like you fell.
You okay, honey?

15:52.792 --> 15:55.250
GREG:
Jen, come out here!

15:55.333 --> 15:56.500
What is it?

15:56.583 --> 15:59.000
What? (gasps)

15:59.083 --> 16:00.667
JEN (quietly):
Oh, my God.

16:00.750 --> 16:04.041
She made herself breakfast.

16:04.125 --> 16:06.542
She's a cereal genius.

16:06.625 --> 16:07.917
You know what?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.208
Of all the words
to follow "cereal,"

16:10.291 --> 16:13.000
"genius" is definitely
the best.

16:13.083 --> 16:14.333
GREG:
Does this mean that we can

16:13.083 --> 16:14.333
go back to bed?

16:14.417 --> 16:16.000
And by bed, does that mean

16:16.083 --> 16:17.625
that I can just lay on a towel
by the toilet, please?

16:17.709 --> 16:18.917
I don't know.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.250
I'm afraid if we move
and disturb her,

16:20.333 --> 16:21.750
this will all go away.

16:21.834 --> 16:24.041
Oops. I forgot my napkin.

16:24.125 --> 16:25.458
-Now, now.
-Okay.

16:29.417 --> 16:32.166
You want? I really think
I came back to life

16:32.250 --> 16:34.041
after that fifth piece.

16:34.125 --> 16:35.250
No, I'm good.

16:35.333 --> 16:37.125
I am kind of thirsty, though.

16:37.208 --> 16:39.542
-Would you get me some water?
-Oh, honey.

16:39.625 --> 16:42.041
Sure, Mommy.

16:42.125 --> 16:46.000
Greg, what if this
morning wasn't a fluke?

16:46.083 --> 16:47.375
I mean, it's like we woke up,

16:47.458 --> 16:49.125
and suddenly she can do
anything.

16:49.208 --> 16:51.083
Eh, I don't know.
I think it's best to assume

16:51.166 --> 16:53.083
she's just gonna bring back
toilet water.

16:53.166 --> 16:55.458
LARK:
You want ice, Mommy?

16:55.542 --> 16:59.166
-Uh, sure, honey.
-Thanks.

16:59.250 --> 17:01.583
Honestly, do you realize
how much time and effort

17:01.667 --> 17:02.750
this could save us?

17:02.834 --> 17:04.041
Like, I haven't done laundry

17:04.125 --> 17:05.291
in two weeks.

17:05.375 --> 17:08.000
I think she would be
very good at it.

17:08.083 --> 17:10.291
That is crazy.
She's three years old.

17:10.375 --> 17:12.375
I mean, can I really trust her
with my whites?

17:12.458 --> 17:15.208
Here, Mommy.
And for you, Daddy.

17:15.291 --> 17:18.000
Thank you, sweetie.

17:19.375 --> 17:21.125
I don't care if it's
toilet water.

17:24.125 --> 17:26.834
-JEN: Hi.
-Hey, girl, hey.

17:26.917 --> 17:29.500
Babe, I killed it at work today.

17:29.583 --> 17:32.000
I was so well-rested,
I made another lawyer cry.

17:32.083 --> 17:33.583
You know how hard that is to do?

17:33.667 --> 17:34.959
Well, I have to think

17:33.667 --> 17:34.959
in three dimensions

17:35.041 --> 17:36.917
to do this, so, yeah.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.291
-Is that the 3-D puzzle you
started before Lark was born?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.291
-Mm-hmm.

17:39.375 --> 17:41.250
Honey, it was the
strangest thing today.

17:41.333 --> 17:43.583
I actually got bored. <i>Bored.</i>

17:43.667 --> 17:44.917
No. Like a 20-something.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.417
Like a 20-something.
I mean, Lark is

17:46.500 --> 17:47.959
basically taking care
of herself.

17:48.041 --> 17:49.166
Oh, she's taking care
of all of us.

17:49.250 --> 17:51.125
-This morning,
she found my keys.

17:49.250 --> 17:51.125
-What?

17:51.208 --> 17:52.792
Yeah. They were
in her toilet, but still.

17:52.875 --> 17:55.041
Who knew that kids could be
more than a burden, huh?

17:55.125 --> 17:57.834
(scoffs) Hey, where is she?
Isn't it her...

17:57.917 --> 18:00.667
-Yeah.
-No.

18:00.750 --> 18:03.083
Putting herself to bed.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.583
Wow.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.709
Good night, Bunny.

18:07.792 --> 18:11.125
Good night, Frankenstein.

18:15.583 --> 18:18.667
Okay. She's wearing
her pajamas backwards,

18:18.750 --> 18:20.542
but beggars can't be choosers.

18:20.625 --> 18:21.917
I can't believe
I'm saying this--

18:22.000 --> 18:23.959
I have more time than
I know what to do with.

18:24.041 --> 18:27.166
Hmm, I think I know what
you could do with it.

18:27.250 --> 18:29.542
Oh, I like the sound
of this.

18:29.625 --> 18:31.709
Yeah, let's get in the
bedroom before I realize

18:31.792 --> 18:34.583
you're interpreting this
as us finishing a puzzle.

18:43.417 --> 18:45.000
(Jen giggling)

18:45.083 --> 18:48.291
That looks so pretty.

18:48.375 --> 18:50.583
Ooh, who got some work done?

18:50.667 --> 18:54.750
Uh, not me, but it's-it's fun
that you think I would.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.583
-Well, you're glowing.
-Oh.

18:56.667 --> 18:57.625
You're both glowing.

18:57.709 --> 18:59.291
Well, I mean,
we both look great

18:59.375 --> 19:00.667
-because we feel great.
-Mm-hmm.

19:00.750 --> 19:03.375
I mean, Lark is so
self-sufficient now.

19:03.458 --> 19:05.875
She's like that robot
that's learned to love

19:05.959 --> 19:07.875
but also comb her own hair.

19:07.959 --> 19:10.125
Yeah. Watch this. Lark, honey,

19:10.208 --> 19:12.166
go get Pop-Pop his drink.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.709
Sure.

19:17.291 --> 19:18.500
Look at her go.

19:18.583 --> 19:21.500
Ah.

19:21.583 --> 19:23.959
She's got a heavy hand
with that rum there.

19:24.041 --> 19:26.875
Well, you can't teach that.
That's just God-given.

19:26.959 --> 19:29.875
GREG: I'm telling you, it's
like Jen and I can finally--

19:29.959 --> 19:31.125
oh, no, no, no, no!

19:31.208 --> 19:33.041
Hey, that's <i>my </i>rum.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.458
So, wait,
how long do I put this in for?

19:39.542 --> 19:42.000
Three minutes, and stir,

19:42.083 --> 19:43.583
then one more minute.

19:43.667 --> 19:45.208
Then you eat it all up.

19:45.291 --> 19:46.458
That's right.

19:46.542 --> 19:49.375
-See you 100 minutes.
-Okay.

19:50.750 --> 19:52.083
Honey, she can do math.

19:52.166 --> 19:54.750
I mean, I don't mean
to overstate things,

19:54.834 --> 19:55.875
but I think she can get a job.

19:55.959 --> 19:56.917
And not some entry-level job.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.250
I'm talking, like,

19:58.333 --> 20:00.250
second-in-charge
at Jamba Juice job.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.709
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

20:01.792 --> 20:04.083
This is incredible.
We have our lives back, Jen.

20:04.166 --> 20:06.750
You know? We can have hobbies.
We can make plans.

20:06.834 --> 20:10.417
We can find out about
the news the day it happens.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.291
And best of all, I get you back.

20:13.375 --> 20:16.542
(chuckles) I'm pregnant.

20:16.625 --> 20:18.333
I know, me, too.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.166
Wait, what?

20:20.250 --> 20:22.834
We're gonna have a baby.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.417
Are you kidding me?

20:24.500 --> 20:26.250
(chuckling):
No. We're gonna have a baby.

20:26.333 --> 20:28.250
(both laughing)

20:30.500 --> 20:32.667
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

20:32.750 --> 20:34.834
Is there any way that you
could just hold it inside

20:34.917 --> 20:35.959
until it's Lark's age?

20:36.041 --> 20:37.125
(laughing)

20:37.208 --> 20:38.625
No, but don't worry.

20:38.709 --> 20:40.625
We'll find a way
to get our freedom back.

20:40.709 --> 20:42.041
Okay.

20:42.125 --> 20:44.500
Hey, Larkie.
Come here for a sec.

20:44.583 --> 20:46.792
We're gonna show you
how to change a diaper.
