18:11.791 --> 18:13.225
You cannot stay
at our house.

18:13.225 --> 18:14.427
Perfect.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.428
Then we're on
the same page.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.796
Yeah, good.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.565
(door bells jingle)

18:21.434 --> 18:22.835
Officers.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.838
Sorry, we're, uh,
we're closing up.

18:25.838 --> 18:26.839
Really?

18:26.839 --> 18:28.341
'Cause, uh...

18:28.341 --> 18:31.410
ah, he's still got, like,
a half a eye to go.

18:31.410 --> 18:32.678
You're crowding me.

18:33.813 --> 18:34.814
RIGGS:
We are looking for

18:34.814 --> 18:36.515
a, uh, Tony Guzman.

18:36.515 --> 18:38.317
He's a triple threat.

18:38.317 --> 18:40.353
Loan shark, extortionist...

18:40.353 --> 18:41.420
What was the third thing?

18:41.420 --> 18:42.421
Cobbler.

18:42.421 --> 18:43.856
Not a cobbler.
Mime?

18:43.856 --> 18:46.258
Dancer.
I don't know if
it was an alchemist or...

18:46.258 --> 18:47.693
Either way. (gasps) Ooh.

18:47.693 --> 18:48.828
Look at this, Rog.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.398
A baseball bat...

18:52.398 --> 18:53.799
signed by Sandy Koufax.

18:53.799 --> 18:57.136
MURTAUGH: Say what? We
were just talking to a guy

18:57.136 --> 18:58.270
who had the exact same bat.

18:58.270 --> 18:59.772
You know, what are the odds

18:59.772 --> 19:00.473
that you had

19:00.473 --> 19:02.108
the previous owner
of this bat

19:02.108 --> 19:03.309
murdered?

19:03.309 --> 19:04.543
Howard Trotter?

19:04.543 --> 19:05.745
You play the horses?

19:05.745 --> 19:06.812
Trotter owed me money.

19:06.812 --> 19:07.813
The bat was collateral.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.148
I didn't kill him.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.216
We didn't say you killed him.

19:10.216 --> 19:11.617
No, no, no, no. No, no. Not you.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.285
We're just saying that
you had your friend,

19:13.285 --> 19:15.855
Axel, do it for you.

19:15.855 --> 19:18.157
(gasps)
Arms dealer!

19:18.157 --> 19:20.359
That was it. It's extortionist,
loan shark, arms dealer.

19:20.359 --> 19:21.661
I knew it was something.
Gun!

19:25.264 --> 19:26.599
(yells)

19:27.867 --> 19:30.336
♪ ♪

19:43.783 --> 19:45.885
(yelling echoes)

19:45.885 --> 19:47.620
Hey! Hey, Riggs!

19:53.826 --> 19:54.827
(exhales):
Oh.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.362
Looks like a home run.

19:56.362 --> 19:57.630
All right.

20:05.189 --> 20:09.093
The illegal sale of firearms,
assault on a police officer.

20:09.093 --> 20:12.096
The unsolicited tattooing
of a police officer.

20:12.096 --> 20:13.831
I was gonna let
that one slide,

20:13.831 --> 20:15.199
'cause that is a
pretty slick tattoo.

20:15.199 --> 20:17.168
Looks like a churro.
Well, it looks

20:17.168 --> 20:18.603
like a squiggly line,
but if you put some wings

20:18.603 --> 20:20.671
on it or something, it
could really look rad.

20:20.671 --> 20:23.574
Uh, and murder
for Howard Trotter.

20:23.574 --> 20:25.076
I didn't kill him.

20:25.076 --> 20:26.344
Trotter owed me money.
Why would I have him killed?

20:26.344 --> 20:29.147
Well, off the top of my head,
to make an example out of him.

20:29.147 --> 20:30.114
RIGGS:
That was a really good answer.

20:30.114 --> 20:32.250
Quite.
Yeah, right?
Off the top of the head.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.252
Off the top of the head. Yeah.
See how quick that was?

20:34.252 --> 20:36.521
To make an example, your break
a leg, you take a finger.

20:36.521 --> 20:38.222
Dead guys can't pay.

20:38.222 --> 20:41.726
Besides, Howard had just come
into a windfall.

20:41.726 --> 20:43.061
(laughs)

20:43.061 --> 20:44.862
RIGGS: Howard wasn't
a winner, so...

20:44.862 --> 20:46.264
What windfall?

20:46.264 --> 20:48.132
I have no idea,
but that's what he told me

20:48.132 --> 20:50.068
the day before he died.

20:52.503 --> 20:53.771
A windfall?

20:53.771 --> 20:55.106
A windfall.
There was no windfall.

20:55.106 --> 20:56.340
He said he had a windfall.

20:56.340 --> 20:58.209
He owed the guy money and
didn't want to lose his fingers,

20:58.209 --> 20:59.143
so he said windfall.

20:59.143 --> 21:01.145
Do you guys still like Guzman
for this?

21:01.145 --> 21:03.081
He was at the track, he sent
the thug to Howard's house,

21:03.081 --> 21:04.582
he probably had
access to needles

21:04.582 --> 21:05.950
and rat poison.

21:05.950 --> 21:07.085
Ooh, did you tell him
about your tattoo?

21:07.085 --> 21:08.119
You got a tattoo?

21:08.119 --> 21:09.120
Let me guess: a little Buddha?

21:09.120 --> 21:10.154
No, squiggly line.

21:10.154 --> 21:11.656
Oh, we should get matching ones.

21:11.656 --> 21:12.890
I'm going home.

21:12.890 --> 21:14.158
What about the windfall?

21:14.158 --> 21:16.461
BOTH: There was no windfall!
Okay.

21:16.461 --> 21:18.763
BAILEY: <i>No one believes</i>
<i>there was a windfall, Leo.</i>

21:18.763 --> 21:20.731
And they're probably right,
but...

21:20.731 --> 21:23.101
what if they're not? Hmm?

21:23.101 --> 21:24.535
You just said they're
probably right.

21:24.535 --> 21:25.970
Here's what I'm saying:

21:25.970 --> 21:27.171
we go to Howard's place,
and you look around

21:27.171 --> 21:29.774
for signs of anything
"windfall‐y," okay?

21:29.774 --> 21:32.143
What if we find something
that blows this case wide open?

21:32.143 --> 21:35.079
Huh? Do you guys want
to be the B‐team forever?

21:35.079 --> 21:37.582
I thought that was
about our names.

21:37.582 --> 21:38.683
It is.

21:38.683 --> 21:40.785
And I'll buy you dinner.

21:48.493 --> 21:50.428
(thunder rumbles)

21:58.769 --> 22:00.905
(horn honks in distance)

22:01.973 --> 22:03.174
NATHAN RIGGS:
<i>Junior?! Junior?!</i>

22:03.174 --> 22:04.442
Get back here!

22:04.442 --> 22:05.643
(panting)

22:05.643 --> 22:06.944
Junior!

22:08.946 --> 22:10.081
Get your ass back here!

22:11.682 --> 22:14.085
Junior!

22:17.088 --> 22:19.023
Where are you?

22:24.695 --> 22:27.798
Get your ass back
in here, boy.

22:35.973 --> 22:38.609
Running like a little rabbit.

22:38.609 --> 22:40.845
(thunder rumbles)

22:40.845 --> 22:42.980
Where are you?

22:45.983 --> 22:47.718
You can't stay out here forever!

22:47.718 --> 22:50.188
You hear me, boy?

22:50.188 --> 22:53.057
You know what's good for ya,
better hope I don't find ya.

22:57.495 --> 22:58.629
You little rabbit.

22:58.629 --> 23:01.098
(thunder rumbles)

23:01.098 --> 23:03.868
Junior!

23:09.173 --> 23:12.176
You little rabbit!

23:12.176 --> 23:13.678
Junior!

23:26.791 --> 23:28.926
(siren wails in distance)

23:35.132 --> 23:37.835
Okay, I vote we call it.

23:37.835 --> 23:40.004
Still over two feet
of sub sandwich left

23:40.004 --> 23:41.072
if anybody wants some.

23:41.072 --> 23:43.708
Leo, your friend, he is...
Eclectic.

23:43.708 --> 23:45.710
A hoarder.

23:45.710 --> 23:47.578
A hoarder with
a sweet music library.

23:47.578 --> 23:49.213
Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden,

23:49.213 --> 23:51.849
Yngwie Malmsteen, Metallica.
(exhales)

23:51.849 --> 23:53.551
Yngwie Malmsteen?

23:53.551 --> 23:56.254
(laughing):
No way. Howard was
definitely not a fan.

23:56.254 --> 23:58.189
Not only that, he, in fact,
very specifically,

23:58.189 --> 23:59.890
was mad at Yngwie

23:59.890 --> 24:02.126
because he lost some money on
a horse that was named Yngwie

24:02.126 --> 24:03.060
Malmsteed.

24:03.060 --> 24:04.161
Well, he's got
over a dozen

24:04.161 --> 24:05.830
of the guy's albums.

24:05.830 --> 24:06.964
Super fan.

24:08.499 --> 24:09.767
That's not right.

24:10.735 --> 24:12.737
That's not the Howard I know.

24:14.972 --> 24:17.575
What the hell is this?

24:17.575 --> 24:20.678
Jockey Club, June 6.

24:20.678 --> 24:22.680
Here. Play it.

24:27.818 --> 24:29.153
MAN (on CD):
Yeah, the three horse

24:29.153 --> 24:31.155
looks like a mudder, but my guy
says it's locked.

24:31.155 --> 24:33.224
Bet the Exacta,
you go home rich.

24:33.224 --> 24:34.925
(stereo switch clicks)

24:34.925 --> 24:37.828
Holy Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
you know what this is?

24:37.828 --> 24:39.463
Private conversations
at the Jockey Club.

24:39.463 --> 24:42.867
LEO:
Whatever Howard heard
probably got him killed.

24:44.935 --> 24:47.471
MURTAUGH:
<i>It's his nerve,</i>

24:47.471 --> 24:49.240
<i>his willingness to offend.</i>

24:49.240 --> 24:52.243
I repeatedly asked him
to stay here,

24:52.243 --> 24:54.879
even though that's
not what I wanted.

24:54.879 --> 24:57.848
I mean, what I wanted...

24:57.848 --> 24:59.583
TRISH:
What?

24:59.583 --> 25:02.586
It's confusing.

25:02.586 --> 25:06.924
You wanted to fix him.

25:06.924 --> 25:09.060
Is that wrong?

25:09.060 --> 25:11.862
No, but...

25:11.862 --> 25:13.931
maybe there are some people
you‐you can't fix.

25:13.931 --> 25:15.132
I don't want
to believe that,

25:15.132 --> 25:19.170
because what if
I'm the one that's broke

25:19.170 --> 25:23.007
and he is the pain
that I can't move past?

25:23.007 --> 25:25.609
(knocking on door)

25:25.609 --> 25:27.945
Maybe I did fix him.
Mm.

25:27.945 --> 25:31.048
I'll see you upstairs.

25:31.048 --> 25:33.184
Yngwie.

25:33.184 --> 25:34.719
What?

25:34.719 --> 25:36.120
We broke the case.

25:36.120 --> 25:37.455
It's almost 11:00.

25:37.455 --> 25:40.558
That's right
and it is time to...

25:40.558 --> 25:41.859
celebrate.

25:41.859 --> 25:43.961
'Cause my knowledge
of Howard

25:43.961 --> 25:45.196
led us right to it.

25:45.196 --> 25:46.230
To what?

25:46.230 --> 25:48.099
The windfall.

25:48.099 --> 25:50.701
(laughs) I could kiss you right
on that head. Bring it in.

25:50.701 --> 25:52.970
(tires screech, crashing)

25:57.208 --> 25:59.043
Oh!

26:19.797 --> 26:22.166
I'm gonna crash here,
after all, Rog.

26:22.166 --> 26:25.136
You know
I handle DUI, right?

26:51.095 --> 26:52.863
(groans lightly)

27:22.460 --> 27:24.595
(clears throat)

27:29.066 --> 27:31.569
Look, Trish, I owe you...
No, no, no, no, no.

27:31.569 --> 27:33.637
No. I'm speaking.

27:35.206 --> 27:36.807
Martin,

27:36.807 --> 27:40.478
just because we let you
into our home does...

27:45.816 --> 27:49.453
You are making
it very hard.

27:55.893 --> 27:58.863
To be continued.

28:04.935 --> 28:07.938
MAN: <i>Bet the Exacta,</i>
<i>you go home rich.</i>

28:09.507 --> 28:11.008
Jockey Club at
the racetrack?

28:11.008 --> 28:14.011
Okay, so you think this
recording got him killed.

28:14.011 --> 28:16.146
Howard heard something
he wasn't supposed to.

28:16.146 --> 28:19.450
Howard logged everything
he recorded in this notebook,

28:19.450 --> 28:21.685
but we checked
against the CDs.

28:21.685 --> 28:24.021
There's one hour missing.

28:24.021 --> 28:25.890
2:00 p. m. to 3:00 p. m.
a month ago, today.

28:25.890 --> 28:28.025
Beautiful. So, head down
to the racetrack,

28:28.025 --> 28:31.061
pull the security video and...
you've already done that.

28:31.061 --> 28:32.062
LEO:
Here we go.

28:32.062 --> 28:34.498
Howard's so‐called friends.

28:34.498 --> 28:38.068
All of them were
at the memorial.

28:38.068 --> 28:40.538
What do we know about them?
Well... oh, perfect timing.

28:40.538 --> 28:42.773
The B‐Team.

28:42.773 --> 28:44.842
You know with the office
supplies in this room alone,

28:44.842 --> 28:45.876
I could kill you
nine different ways.

28:45.876 --> 28:47.912
BOWMAN:
Mitch Brennan.

28:47.912 --> 28:50.714
Served time for kidnapping
and extortion.

28:50.714 --> 28:52.550
Joey McConnel,
skated on a weapons beef.

28:52.550 --> 28:56.220
Hoak Zeeland,
federal explosives charges,

28:56.220 --> 28:58.956
and Shane Plyskin,
just out of Lompoc

28:58.956 --> 29:00.457
for attempted murder.

29:00.457 --> 29:02.026
What do they all
have in common?

29:02.026 --> 29:04.061
Hmm?

29:04.061 --> 29:06.931
They all hate
the Jockey Club.

29:06.931 --> 29:11.535
And yet, they were all
at the Jockey Club. Ironic.

29:11.535 --> 29:12.903
That's not what
ironic means.

29:12.903 --> 29:13.938
Yeah.

29:13.938 --> 29:17.841
Okay, I'm gonna go back
to this godforsaken bar,

29:17.841 --> 29:19.743
find out what
they were talking about.

29:19.743 --> 29:21.412
Maybe keep Bailey away from Leo.

29:21.412 --> 29:22.646
He's a bleeder.

29:25.916 --> 29:27.051
LEO:
Hey, Rog.

29:27.051 --> 29:29.186
The answer is no,
you can't come, Leo.

29:29.186 --> 29:30.554
I wasn't going to.

29:30.554 --> 29:34.525
Look, Riggs...
he's in pain.

29:34.525 --> 29:36.026
You don't do
what he did...

29:36.026 --> 29:38.095
Park his house on yours?

29:38.095 --> 29:39.163
...unless you're in pain.

29:39.163 --> 29:40.864
Okay? He's in pain.

29:40.864 --> 29:44.101
Don't be so mad at him
that you can't see that.

29:44.101 --> 29:45.202
Friendship is fleeting.

29:45.202 --> 29:47.471
You know what I would give

29:47.471 --> 29:49.039
for one more day with Howard?

29:49.039 --> 29:51.008
Excuse me, Mr. Getz?

29:51.008 --> 29:53.677
This came for you.
Howard Trotter's remains,

29:53.677 --> 29:55.179
or cremains, actually.

29:55.179 --> 29:56.847
Not sure why they came
to the morgue.

29:56.847 --> 29:58.449
No, no, I‐I requested that.

29:58.449 --> 30:00.117
That way they waive
the delivery fee, so...

30:00.117 --> 30:03.887
Classy to the end, Leo.

30:03.887 --> 30:06.457
So, what are you
gonna do with him?

30:06.457 --> 30:09.927
Oh, Howard left
instructions.

30:09.927 --> 30:12.196
ANNOUNCER:
Friends and family day here

30:12.196 --> 30:15.532
at beautiful Santa Anita Park.

30:15.532 --> 30:17.501
Hi.
Hi.

30:17.501 --> 30:19.670
Uh, table for one, please.

30:19.670 --> 30:21.939
Maybe something with a
view of the finish line.

30:24.008 --> 30:25.976
Right this way.

30:27.745 --> 30:30.981
ANNOUNCER:
Final round.

30:30.981 --> 30:32.983
How'd you sleep?

30:32.983 --> 30:34.685
Good.

30:34.685 --> 30:37.154
And how's my lawn?

30:37.154 --> 30:38.656
That's a work in progress.

30:41.091 --> 30:43.494
That's unusual on race day.

30:43.494 --> 30:45.696
Mm‐hmm.

30:58.075 --> 31:00.811
(humming)

31:03.013 --> 31:06.150
HOST: What in God's name
are you doing?

31:06.150 --> 31:07.851
That better not be
what I think it is.

31:16.560 --> 31:19.196
So, this is your idea
of proactive policing?

31:19.196 --> 31:21.632
Yeah, the window
was broken.

31:21.632 --> 31:23.801
We were concerned about
the establishment.

31:23.801 --> 31:26.837
Huh. Well, wish all cops
could be as thoughtful as us.

31:29.139 --> 31:31.475
(grunting)

31:43.220 --> 31:45.856
(shouts)
What?

31:45.856 --> 31:49.259
I just touched some gum
or human tissue or something.

31:49.259 --> 31:51.095
Got to wash my hands.

31:51.095 --> 31:53.230
What, are you serious?

31:53.230 --> 31:54.465
Yes.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.735
It's out of order.

32:00.904 --> 32:02.039
Hey, Riggs.

32:02.039 --> 32:04.374
You need to see this.

32:10.114 --> 32:11.982
RIGGS:
Bingo.

32:13.217 --> 32:15.219
Not just any ashes,

32:15.219 --> 32:18.021
this was Mr. Howard Trotter,
okay?

32:18.021 --> 32:18.756
Security, over here.

32:18.756 --> 32:20.657
This man needs
to be removed.

32:20.657 --> 32:22.159
Okay.
I'll take him.

32:22.159 --> 32:25.763
I'll see you in court. See
you in court with my bruises.

32:25.763 --> 32:28.065
Shane.

32:28.065 --> 32:31.869
Say one more word and you'll
join your friend Howard.

32:36.907 --> 32:40.077
ANNOUNCER: And so we come to
the penultimate race of the day.

32:40.077 --> 32:42.679
Odds on favorite,
Pogo Painter in yellow.

32:42.679 --> 32:46.049
Sir Red in blue and
Running Mare in fuchsia pink

32:46.049 --> 32:47.117
at seven to one.

32:47.117 --> 32:49.653
It is estimated
over $5 million

32:49.653 --> 32:52.122
is weighted on this race,

32:52.122 --> 32:53.924
including two million cash
right here in Santa Anita Park.

32:53.924 --> 32:56.093
Here come the last horses,

32:56.093 --> 32:58.796
Chubby Rose and Mustangus
entering their gates.

32:58.796 --> 33:00.030
(bells ringing)
And they're off.

33:01.131 --> 33:02.432
MAN:
Get back! Get back!

33:04.935 --> 33:07.004
Beautiful day for a race, folks.

33:09.039 --> 33:10.974
Everyone,
get on the floor now.

33:13.710 --> 33:15.712
Bad guys and
semiautomatics.

33:15.712 --> 33:17.581
Perfect timing as usual.

33:17.581 --> 33:20.484
Speak for yourself. My
will isn't done yet.

33:20.484 --> 33:23.120
(people cheering)

33:23.120 --> 33:25.088
45 seconds.

33:26.757 --> 33:28.091
35 seconds.

33:28.091 --> 33:29.059
Don't be a hero.

33:29.059 --> 33:31.161
Get your face
on the floor.

33:35.999 --> 33:39.002
We got 20 seconds left.
Go, go, go!

33:45.976 --> 33:47.711
What the hell are you
shooting at down there?!

33:47.711 --> 33:49.880
Just a couple
Girl Scouts!

33:51.081 --> 33:52.749
All right, all right! New deal.

33:52.749 --> 33:55.219
That wasn't too
sportsmanlike, now was it?

33:55.219 --> 33:56.553
Come on, let's go.

33:56.553 --> 33:58.956
(audience cheering)

33:58.956 --> 34:00.724
Go out the front now!

34:00.724 --> 34:02.426
Come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

34:08.799 --> 34:10.100
LAPD.

34:13.537 --> 34:14.838
Thanks, buddy.

34:19.042 --> 34:20.477
Let's go!

34:20.477 --> 34:22.479
Move!

34:26.683 --> 34:28.986
You okay?
Yeah.

34:33.657 --> 34:34.992
Hey!

34:40.731 --> 34:43.066
Leo!

34:43.066 --> 34:45.035
Rog, you go with him.
I'm going this way.

34:52.175 --> 34:53.610
How much, huh?

34:53.610 --> 34:55.112
Shut up and move, okay?

34:55.112 --> 34:56.213
Howard was recording
conversations at the Jockey Club

34:56.213 --> 34:58.215
and he heard about your robbery

34:58.215 --> 35:00.183
and he asked you to pay him
to keep it quiet.

35:00.183 --> 35:02.185
So, how much?

35:02.185 --> 35:03.020
Tell me.

35:03.020 --> 35:04.187
Ten grand.

35:04.187 --> 35:05.989
You killed him.

35:05.989 --> 35:07.858
He was not worth
ten grand, huh?

35:07.858 --> 35:10.460
You're worth a lot less.

35:10.460 --> 35:11.762
Hold it.

35:11.762 --> 35:13.130
Drop the gun or I
shoot your friend.

35:13.130 --> 35:14.064
He's an acquaintance.

35:14.064 --> 35:15.933
Only worked with him twice.

35:15.933 --> 35:17.601
We almost went to a movie,
don't forget.

35:17.601 --> 35:19.036
We don't have to do this!

35:19.036 --> 35:21.838
Oh, great.
I accept your surrender.

35:21.838 --> 35:24.007
I got a million in each bag.

35:24.007 --> 35:26.109
We could both walk
out of here rich men.

35:26.109 --> 35:30.047
Yeah. You know, I've just
never been good with handouts.

35:30.047 --> 35:32.182
You know?
Just ask anybody, really.

35:32.182 --> 35:33.784
My partner, especially.
He'll tell you.

35:33.784 --> 35:36.053
SHANE:
Gun on the ground now.

35:36.053 --> 35:37.688
Okay. I'm lowering it.

35:37.688 --> 35:39.823
No, no, no, no. P‐Please,
don't put the gun down.

35:44.628 --> 35:47.097
Don't think about me.
Think about Howard.

35:47.097 --> 35:50.200
And it's time to let him go.
LEO: Please don't
put the gun down.

35:50.200 --> 35:52.402
He will shoot you. He will
shoot you. He <i>will</i> shoot you.

35:57.908 --> 35:59.076
Let Howard go.

36:03.680 --> 36:05.349
(woman screams)

36:08.785 --> 36:11.488
(coughing)

36:11.488 --> 36:12.789
Are you okay?

36:12.789 --> 36:14.758
(coughing):
I got Howard in my mouth

36:14.758 --> 36:15.926
and I don't know what part.

36:15.926 --> 36:17.494
I got him all over.

36:17.494 --> 36:19.029
(coughs)
Don't drive for
a little bit.

36:23.767 --> 36:26.169
I also want to thank
some of the little people.

36:26.169 --> 36:29.006
The Robbery‐Homicide
Custodial Team,

36:29.006 --> 36:30.040
who returned my suit to me,

36:30.040 --> 36:32.109
both starched and blood‐free.

36:32.109 --> 36:34.211
And as we all know, you got to
look like money to make money

36:34.211 --> 36:36.747
and it can't be money that's
covered in, uh, viscera.

36:36.747 --> 36:38.882
How long has he
been doing this?

36:38.882 --> 36:40.117
Feels like a week.

36:40.117 --> 36:42.119
LEO:
And, lest we forget,

36:42.119 --> 36:44.221
let's give a giant whoop‐whoop
to two scrappy underdogs

36:44.221 --> 36:45.722
that I think nobody

36:45.722 --> 36:47.924
thought they had it
in them at all.

36:47.924 --> 36:49.760
I was more surprised
than anyone.

36:49.760 --> 36:52.129
Great work from the B‐Team.

36:52.129 --> 36:54.131
I think that just
became a thing.

36:54.131 --> 36:55.599
You're the worst.

36:55.599 --> 36:57.868
And my penultimate thought...

36:57.868 --> 37:00.203
I would like to honor
the life of a friend

37:00.203 --> 37:02.172
by thanking another,

37:02.172 --> 37:05.776
a man that was willing
to lay down his life for me.

37:05.776 --> 37:08.945
Detective Roger
Mayfield Murtaugh!

37:08.945 --> 37:12.616
Okay, all right, Leo,
it's not the Oscars.

37:12.616 --> 37:14.751
Everybody, go back to work.

37:14.751 --> 37:16.653
There was a little...
I was oh, so close to done.

37:16.653 --> 37:18.588
One more thing. There
he is, that's right.

37:18.588 --> 37:20.190
Detective Roger
Mayfield Murtaugh,

37:20.190 --> 37:23.560
as selfless as he is humble,

37:23.560 --> 37:25.695
but when you put
down that gun...

37:25.695 --> 37:28.565
Leo, it's called
following protocol

37:28.565 --> 37:30.033
and I would've
done it for anyone.

37:30.033 --> 37:31.902
(chuckling):
Okay.

37:31.902 --> 37:33.737
You know and I know.

37:33.737 --> 37:35.105
and that's what's important.

37:35.105 --> 37:38.008
"Pain and suffering"?

37:38.008 --> 37:40.177
You're suing the city,
Detective?

37:40.177 --> 37:41.812
N‐No, I am not.

37:41.812 --> 37:45.182
Yes, you are because he was
injured in the line of duty

37:45.182 --> 37:46.650
by that tattoo needle,
which has left him

37:46.650 --> 37:51.521
irrevocably with
an errant squiggle.

37:51.521 --> 37:53.890
I did not file a lawsuit.

37:53.890 --> 37:55.092
I did it pro bono.

37:55.092 --> 37:57.160
And we are going to
get you restitution

37:57.160 --> 37:59.996
for emotional distress
and punitive damages.

37:59.996 --> 38:01.131
This is not happening.

38:01.131 --> 38:02.532
Mm‐hmm, it is happening.

38:02.532 --> 38:03.867
And guess what?
You and me are gonna spend

38:03.867 --> 38:04.901
a lot of time together.

38:04.901 --> 38:06.703
We're gonna be, uh, uh,
having strategy sessions

38:06.703 --> 38:08.538
and late nights
of Chinese food.

38:08.538 --> 38:10.507
You and me, and we're gonna
be Skyping each other.
Okay.

38:10.507 --> 38:12.008
Leo.
Mm‐hmm?

38:12.008 --> 38:13.577
I see what's happening here...
Mm‐hmm.

38:13.577 --> 38:16.179
...and we do not need
to have a lawsuit

38:16.179 --> 38:18.048
to hang out.
(laughs)

38:18.048 --> 38:20.150
(laughing):
What does that mean?

38:20.150 --> 38:22.185
No. This is about justice.

38:22.185 --> 38:25.422
Look, Trish and I are going
to the movies on Saturday night.

38:25.422 --> 38:26.590
I would love to come.

38:26.590 --> 38:27.824
Drop the lawsuit.

38:27.824 --> 38:29.759
I'll see you Saturday.
Yeah.

38:33.063 --> 38:34.731
You wanted to see me?

38:34.731 --> 38:38.101
I heard you found a place
to sleep last night.

38:38.101 --> 38:40.103
So they tell me.

38:40.103 --> 38:43.039
Well, I got you something.

38:43.039 --> 38:45.909
Uh, toothbrush,
pillow, blankets,

38:45.909 --> 38:49.212
for the next time
you're stuck.

38:49.212 --> 38:51.081
Oh, I appreciate that,
Doc, but I'm...

38:51.081 --> 38:53.216
Proficient at getting by
on your own?

38:53.216 --> 38:55.886
Thing is, you're not.

38:55.886 --> 38:57.120
What, not getting by?

38:57.120 --> 38:58.722
You're not on your own.

38:58.722 --> 39:01.057
Oh.
I hate to break
this to you, Riggs,

39:01.057 --> 39:05.896
but despite your best efforts,
people care about you.

barbeque sauce?

Barbeque marinade.

41:18.628 --> 41:19.696
What's the difference?

41:19.696 --> 41:21.064
There is no difference.

41:21.064 --> 41:22.632

until RJ is
emotionally ready.

Yes. Two teaspoons.

What?

41:43.119 --> 41:44.254
No, oregano, honey.

41:44.254 --> 41:45.255
That might give it

the‐the kick that it needs.

41:45.989 --> 41:47.657

BOTH:

Changing the will.

(laughing):
