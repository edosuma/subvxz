00:01.168 --> 00:03.462
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.629 --> 00:05.047
We're trapped in the Framework.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.550
Please tell me that you built a back door
to this place.

00:07.717 --> 00:09.260
- I did.
- Tell me where to go.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.886
Had an old-school spy camera.

00:11.053 --> 00:12.888
- Took some pictures in the lab.
- Pictures of what?

00:13.097 --> 00:14.890
The Doctor's been working
on a secret project.

00:15.057 --> 00:17.810
The people from that world want
to destroy what we've built.

00:18.019 --> 00:20.479
This is why you've been so keen
on finishing Project Looking Glass.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.106
Fire on the quarantine building.

00:24.984 --> 00:27.153
Activating body cam. Going in.

00:27.403 --> 00:29.488
- Get him out.
- Nobody move!

00:29.697 --> 00:31.240
Are you insane?
He's trying to save a kid!

00:40.166 --> 00:41.959
Is it true that you're an Inhuman?

00:42.251 --> 00:45.254
Yeah, powerful enough to bring
this whole damn place down.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.423
I hope so.

01:01.437 --> 01:04.105
<i>Good morning! I'm Sunil Bakshi,</i>

01:04.482 --> 01:07.443
<i>and today, we are talking about justice.</i>

01:08.319 --> 01:11.781
<i>Yesterday, we witnessed a harrowing
and unprovoked attack</i>

01:12.156 --> 01:14.784
<i>on Hydra's Enlightenment
Cultivation Centre.</i>

01:15.284 --> 01:18.579
The perpetrator, the Inhuman terrorist
and Resistance leader

01:18.746 --> 01:20.915
who called himself the "Patriot"

01:21.248 --> 01:24.126
<i>again acted with flagrant disregard
for human life.</i>

01:25.086 --> 01:29.548
<i>But we are pleased to report
the Patriot has been killed.</i>

01:29.965 --> 01:33.761
<i>That man will no longer stand as a symbol
of evil and villainy.</i>

01:34.303 --> 01:36.972
<i>And while this is a cause for celebration,</i>

01:37.515 --> 01:40.601
<i>it is also a reminder to remain
ever vigilant.</i>

01:41.310 --> 01:45.898
<i>One must never forget that danger can lurk
around any corner.</i>

02:03.958 --> 02:05.000
You're looking better.

02:07.253 --> 02:09.380
Yeah. Thanks for that.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.720
Try to keep up while you recover.

02:44.248 --> 02:46.709
- Where to next?
- Elevator to the garage.

02:47.543 --> 02:48.544
Cover me.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.558
Come on.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.904
Drop your weapons! Now!

03:20.492 --> 03:22.244
Agent May, interesting.

03:25.664 --> 03:28.876
No matter the circumstance,
none of you can escape your true nature.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.712
You, the warrior.

03:32.421 --> 03:33.923
Mack, the protector.

03:36.050 --> 03:38.219
And Fitz, well...

03:38.844 --> 03:39.845
He's a romantic.

03:40.471 --> 03:42.348
And me, what I...
don't make the list?

03:51.607 --> 03:52.608
Let's move.

04:29.478 --> 04:32.439
I did not think it possible for a machine
to be on edge.

04:33.857 --> 04:34.858
It is not.

04:35.025 --> 04:38.028
I am simply re-calibrating
after a setback within the Framework.

04:39.405 --> 04:41.240
Has one
of your playthings rebelled?

04:42.283 --> 04:45.202
Agent May has begun to question
the narrative she was programmed with.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.664
How very human of her.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.876
It is no more than a slight complication.

04:54.837 --> 04:57.089
Then I will un-complicate it for you.

05:08.309 --> 05:11.812
What have you done to me?
Why can I not kill her?

05:12.771 --> 05:13.897
Because I built you.

05:16.108 --> 05:18.861
The same parameters
that limit me must also limit you.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.781
My primary directive requires me
to protect these people.

05:24.158 --> 05:27.077
- Then we are both powerless.
- Not entirely.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.914
If they become a direct threat
to the Framework,

05:31.540 --> 05:33.208
then they no longer require protection.

05:34.585 --> 05:37.212
And there are already two agents
that fall into this category...

05:38.047 --> 05:39.882
Jemma Simmons and Daisy Johnson.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.425
The Inhuman.

05:43.052 --> 05:44.470
She's hacked into the Framework.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.931
The two are inside with memories intact,
trying to dismantle it.

05:48.223 --> 05:51.352
So now their deaths are required

05:51.894 --> 05:55.314
and easily achievable.
I simply need you to find them.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.275
With pleasure.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.736
<i>Jeffrey Mace hated our freedoms</i>

06:01.236 --> 06:03.030
<i>and sought to turn our country...</i>

06:04.156 --> 06:06.950
Tainting the name of a good man.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.870
Anyone else getting sick
of this propaganda crap?

06:10.287 --> 06:11.747
Ah, it's like sipping poison.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.708
Little bit every day,
you don't even notice till it kills you.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.545
- We need to start thinking retaliation.
- Retaliation?

06:19.630 --> 06:21.757
No, we got to put human lives
before revenge.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.427
Look, those people were promised
a better life.

06:25.594 --> 06:28.263
Now, the man who made that promise
is gone, so you got to talk to them

06:28.430 --> 06:30.432
- and let them know...
- We'll make good on it, I know.

06:30.557 --> 06:34.895
Or how about we review those plans I stole
from Hydra's lab?

06:35.020 --> 06:36.855
You know, since I almost died to get them.

06:37.898 --> 06:41.110
Look, if she's building some...
some crazy Doomsday device...

06:41.318 --> 06:45.114
Can we not use that word to describe it?
It's not helping me think.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.867
- This is how movements die.
- Don't say that, sir.

06:49.326 --> 06:52.413
Well, if history's taught me anything,
it's that good intentions don't translate

06:52.538 --> 06:54.373
into action without a steady hand
to guide them.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.042
The Patriot brought all these people
together.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.295
- His death might tear them apart.
- I still can't believe he's gone.

07:00.712 --> 07:03.465
We need to get out of the Framework
before we lose anyone else.

07:04.133 --> 07:05.300
Hey, check this out.

07:07.469 --> 07:12.474
<i>We've received word of a terrorist attack
at the Triskelion.</i>

07:13.642 --> 07:17.729
<i>Sources say that an Inhuman made
an attempt on Madame Hydra's life.</i>

07:18.730 --> 07:21.191
<i>Fortunately, our beloved leader emerged
unscathed,</i>

07:21.316 --> 07:23.652
<i>but the vile assailant remains at large.</i>

07:24.069 --> 07:25.362
Daisy?

07:35.330 --> 07:38.500
So, why exactly did you help me?

07:38.917 --> 07:40.669
Last time I checked,
you weren't really rooting

07:40.836 --> 07:41.837
for team Inhuman.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.465
When an enemy sacrifices his life
for yours,

07:44.798 --> 07:47.342
you have to question if you're fighting
for the wrong side.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.721
Seeing that building collapse
on the Patriot, I...

07:52.181 --> 07:53.891
Wait, the Patriot's dead?

07:56.560 --> 07:58.187
I know what he meant to the Resistance.

07:58.687 --> 08:02.024
No. It's not just that. He...

08:03.275 --> 08:04.943
We lost one.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.030
Mourn later. Right now, I need your head
in the game.

08:08.739 --> 08:11.700
I'm trying. I'm still feeling
the after-effects of the Terrigen.

08:12.367 --> 08:15.120
It's like a... hangover made of bees.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.789
I've seen what Terrigenesis
does to people.

08:17.915 --> 08:21.084
What I don't get is how you can control
your powers so quickly.

08:21.793 --> 08:24.463
- I've had practice.
- What the hell does that mean?

08:25.005 --> 08:26.048
It means...

08:28.800 --> 08:31.553
You know what? I'm not gonna go there.
Just... just keep moving.

08:33.096 --> 08:35.474
The Resistance must have a base
of operation. Where is it?

08:35.682 --> 08:38.352
No idea. All I know is a time and place
to make contact.

08:38.644 --> 08:39.811
We just have to get there.

08:40.938 --> 08:43.148
We're confident
that she'll regain consciousness, sir.

08:43.690 --> 08:47.110
There is, however, cause for concern
regarding her spine.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.155
Will she walk?

08:50.656 --> 08:54.743
The trauma shattered
her T-four and T-five vertebrae.

08:56.954 --> 09:00.541
And we're still determining the extent
of the nerve damage,

09:01.291 --> 09:03.168
- but, uh, there are exciting...
- Leave.

09:05.629 --> 09:06.880
- ...new treatments...
- Now.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.517
We'll find a way to help her.
There's no doubt.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.729
But for now, your focus should be
on the traitors who did this.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.690
They've made us look weak.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.901
- I can't have that.
- No.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.654
So, what are you going to do about it?

09:33.323 --> 09:34.700
Send a message to the people.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.159
Exactly.

09:37.703 --> 09:39.246
Betrayal will not be tolerated.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.456
That's my son.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.918
We're all hoping for Ophelia's recovery,

09:45.294 --> 09:46.628
but in the meantime,

09:47.129 --> 09:49.381
you have an obligation to lead.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.301
You're the new head of Hydra.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.117
Mr Bakshi here to see you.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.960
Leopold, I came as soon as I could.

10:28.587 --> 10:30.339
What kind of monsters would do this?

10:31.840 --> 10:32.966
Inhumans.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.636
The ever-present threat.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.680
- And Ophelia? Is she...
- She's fine.

10:39.681 --> 10:40.724
Good.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.518
I would love to see her
on the show tonight.

10:44.061 --> 10:47.356
Her charming visage could really drum up
sympathies for the cause.

10:48.190 --> 10:49.274
No interviews.

10:50.609 --> 10:53.320
People like to see their leader's unshaken
after an attack.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.031
I said no.

10:57.783 --> 10:58.784
Of course.

11:00.118 --> 11:03.038
We can use archival footage,
placate the public.

11:03.205 --> 11:04.539
They'll never know the difference.

11:05.916 --> 11:08.043
Well, no, I don't want
the public placated.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.045
I want them afraid.

11:12.214 --> 11:13.757
Well, what do you need from me?

11:15.842 --> 11:19.304
<i>We can now exclusively confirm
the identities of the terrorists</i>

11:19.513 --> 11:23.517
<i>responsible for this morning's horrific
attack on the Triskelion.</i>

11:24.935 --> 11:27.646
<i>This woman, known by the alias Skye,</i>

11:27.938 --> 11:30.565
<i>is a member
of the Inhumans' first movement.</i>

11:30.899 --> 11:33.902
<i>Her goal... destabilise Hydra from within.</i>

11:34.319 --> 11:35.529
<i>We warn our audience</i>

11:35.654 --> 11:39.116
<i>that this Inhuman has the potential
to cause mass destruction,</i>

11:39.700 --> 11:42.369
<i>and she has been known
to target civilians.</i>

11:42.577 --> 11:45.622
<i>Her accomplice, Melinda May, colluded
with the Patriot</i>

11:46.039 --> 11:47.666
<i>to destroy the Enlightenment Centre.</i>

11:48.875 --> 11:52.462
<i>We are asking you, the public,
to do your civic duty</i>

11:52.921 --> 11:54.840
<i>and help bring these killers to justice.</i>

11:55.424 --> 11:56.925
<i>Those who provide any information</i>

11:57.050 --> 11:58.260
<i>that could lead us...</i>

11:59.469 --> 12:01.263
Hey! Calm down.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.390
At least Skye's not a prisoner anymore.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.601
Yeah, but if Hydra finds her before I do,
they'll march her into a public square

12:06.935 --> 12:08.687
- and put a bullet in her head.
- Hey.

12:09.813 --> 12:11.106
Not in front of my daughter.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.318
Like it or not,
this is the reality we live in.

12:17.904 --> 12:18.989
I have to find her.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.451
Would they really kill Skye?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.954
No, just, uh...

12:26.788 --> 12:28.165
He's just getting worked up.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.250
She's gonna be fine.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.171
The guy on the TV said she was dangerous.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.131
She seemed nice.

12:36.715 --> 12:39.551
Sweetheart, the news is controlled
by Hydra.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.137
Just try not to pay any attention to that,
okay?

12:42.763 --> 12:44.014
Everything's gonna be all right.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.314
I'm gathering a team to search for Skye.

12:52.647 --> 12:54.649
- Could use a few extra bodies.
- Do we have a lead?

12:54.983 --> 12:57.486
No lead. But if we don't leave now,
we're gonna be searching for a corpse.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.112
Let's... let's think this through.

12:59.738 --> 13:02.157
Skye could be anywhere.
Running blind puts our people at risk.

13:02.365 --> 13:06.620
She is at risk.
Hydra is hunting her, full force!

13:06.995 --> 13:09.247
Call me crazy,
but I think she can take care of herself.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.333
The smart move is to wait
for her to reach out.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.667
Look, this isn't your wheelhouse.

13:12.793 --> 13:15.462
I'm sure you're a good schoolteacher,
but, uh... you're a schoolteacher.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.672
Maybe, but...

13:18.590 --> 13:21.426
someone once thought I could be more
than that.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.845
I had a chance to join S.H.I.E.L.D.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.849
A man showed up when I was fresh out
of school...

13:27.974 --> 13:29.851
I don't have time for a history lesson.

13:31.353 --> 13:32.395
I said no...

13:33.438 --> 13:34.689
because I was afraid...

13:35.190 --> 13:36.733
the way you're afraid right now.

13:37.818 --> 13:40.862
- Don't let emotion cloud your judgment.
- That's not what's going on here.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.741
I could've changed my life that day.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.370
But it seemed like
too much responsibility.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.705
I didn't want to shoulder it.

13:52.207 --> 13:53.750
But now I think maybe I should have.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.794
Well, when I got that offer, I took it.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.672
I was serving time.

13:59.214 --> 14:02.342
Arson, first degree.
Pretty sure my life was over.

14:03.552 --> 14:04.886
That's when someone came to me.

14:07.389 --> 14:08.431
A S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?

14:09.599 --> 14:11.309
What was his name?

14:12.561 --> 14:14.229
She'd laugh that you assumed it was a guy.

14:15.564 --> 14:16.940
Her name was Victoria Hand.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.735
She was the first person to tell me,
I could be a good man.

14:21.903 --> 14:23.488
Skye was the one who made me believe it.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.782
Now, she is in danger.

14:27.450 --> 14:29.744
I can't just sit around and do nothing.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.039
Try not to get killed, okay?

14:45.427 --> 14:48.263
We need to be more cautious.
It's too risky on foot. We need wheels.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.851
- We already committed treason.
- What's a little grand theft auto?

14:59.900 --> 15:02.444
- You see that look?
- Maybe she's just racist.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.112
Or starstruck.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.539
It must've been difficult
to recover these.

15:14.748 --> 15:15.874
Hey, it's what I do.

15:16.374 --> 15:18.710
I'm just bummed I lost
my granddad's camera.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.337
Howling Commandos, right?

15:21.212 --> 15:22.631
I always meant to ask you about that.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.424
What do you mean, "always"?

15:26.343 --> 15:29.638
Uh... I... I just... I'd heard.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.682
You're quite popular
within the Resistance.

15:32.807 --> 15:35.185
You know it.

15:38.813 --> 15:42.108
Oh, no, no, no.
This is quantum-energy manipulation.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.986
- Darkhold tech.
- Dark-who now?

15:45.445 --> 15:47.155
I've seen this machinery before.

15:47.572 --> 15:51.368
It was designed to build elements
from thin air.

15:51.493 --> 15:55.288
This... this looks like it's creating
something even more complex.

15:55.747 --> 15:58.333
That machine required
an immense amount of energy.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.585
It was powered by a hydroelectric dam.

16:00.752 --> 16:04.089
No doubt, this device would need
a more substantial energy source.

16:04.673 --> 16:07.258
Did you hear anything like that mentioned
when you were undercover?

16:07.550 --> 16:08.677
Nothing about a dam,

16:09.177 --> 16:11.888
but I heard someone talking
about shipping parts east

16:12.055 --> 16:13.515
to some oil-drilling platform.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.309
Ivanov's base in the Baltic Sea.

16:17.102 --> 16:19.479
Of course, Aida's using
his assets here.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.731
She's probably working with him
on this side, too.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.274
Wait. What are you talking about?

16:24.109 --> 16:25.986
I think I know where the machine
is being built.

16:27.529 --> 16:30.365
Can we take the Quinjet
on a recon mission?

16:30.699 --> 16:32.075
Nobody here to tell us no.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.035
I'll grab a team.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.621
Are you sure the Patriot's dead?

16:39.958 --> 16:43.378
I saw the building collapse on him.
I have the body-cam footage to prove it.

16:53.847 --> 16:54.889
This is our window.

17:08.153 --> 17:09.738
- Get out of here.
- Hey! Hey.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.573
We are friends of the Resistance.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.451
I know who you are.
There's chatter all over the police band.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.869
We weren't followed. We were careful.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.330
Not careful enough.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.459
Milkman, I have contact!

17:23.585 --> 17:24.586
Ah!

17:27.172 --> 17:28.256
Damn!

17:30.925 --> 17:31.926
Come on!

17:35.305 --> 17:36.723
Incoming!

17:48.443 --> 17:49.486
Where's Ward?

17:51.154 --> 17:52.447
He went looking for Skye.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.616
- Agent Triplett?
- Took the Quinjet

17:54.741 --> 17:56.659
on some kind of recon mission
with Simmons.

17:57.202 --> 17:58.369
Take a breath. What's going on?

17:58.620 --> 18:00.038
One of our field agents just called in.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.956
Said he had made contact with someone.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.250
- Was it Skye?
- I don't know. There were gunshots.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.460
The line went dead.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.796
Could be her, could be a trap.

18:08.463 --> 18:11.341
Mace was always the one
to make these calls.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.136
Let's go check it out.

18:15.887 --> 18:18.306
W... what about backup?
What about transport?

18:18.681 --> 18:20.934
- We're spread too thin.
- I'll drive.

18:21.684 --> 18:23.394
The Hydra bus should get us
there in one piece.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.939
- You sure?
- Yeah, somebody's got to step up.

18:26.147 --> 18:27.273
I'll catch up with you, okay?

18:29.984 --> 18:31.111
- Mrs Lee.
- Yeah.

18:31.236 --> 18:33.905
- Can you watch Hope for a couple of hours?
- Sure, whatever you need.

18:34.531 --> 18:35.573
Thank you.

18:41.079 --> 18:43.164
Hey. Hey, sparkplug, uh...

18:43.957 --> 18:46.626
I have to take off for a little bit
to help S.H.I.E.L.D.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.002
Can I help?

18:49.712 --> 18:51.089
Okay. Uh...

18:52.048 --> 18:54.551
There's some busted walkie-talkies
by the bunks over there.

18:55.260 --> 18:57.470
Maybe you can show the other kids
how to fix a radio.

18:57.846 --> 19:00.557
That might take a while, but okay.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.695
He's still breathing,

19:14.112 --> 19:16.197
but we're gonna need to find another way
to get out of here.

19:16.739 --> 19:18.408
How long before Hydra busts down
that door?

19:18.741 --> 19:19.784
Not long.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.746
They'll be following S.O.P.
for a hostile Inhuman.

19:25.456 --> 19:28.543
Six teams to sweep the area.
And if the hostile's taken cover...

19:29.752 --> 19:32.046
they'll call in an air strike
and sort through the rubble later.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.215
Like what they did with the Patriot?

19:37.218 --> 19:38.344
What I did.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.852
That air strike was on my order.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.694
You didn't know.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.071
Doesn't change what I did.

19:59.324 --> 20:00.992
You can't blame yourself for their lies.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.078
Once you learned the truth,
you fought back.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.122
That is what we need.

20:07.373 --> 20:11.544
If... more people see what you saw,
maybe they'll fight back, too.

20:30.521 --> 20:31.731
How is she?

20:32.315 --> 20:33.441
No change.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.781
Bakshi's exposé worked.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.785
- You've found them?
- Tips from the public are pouring in.

20:44.369 --> 20:45.745
One of them looks legitimate.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.748
I have men closing in
on their location now.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.714
I want to monitor the situation
personally.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.134
Ophelia?

21:00.885 --> 21:02.136
You're awake.

21:04.305 --> 21:05.473
Leopold...

21:07.058 --> 21:08.768
- finish it.
- I will.

21:09.394 --> 21:11.312
I will. We've just gotten word
on their location...

21:11.604 --> 21:12.647
No.

21:13.147 --> 21:14.983
Finish the machine.

21:15.942 --> 21:19.153
If Project Looking Glass is completed,
it won't matter.

21:19.654 --> 21:21.656
This body won't matter.

21:23.908 --> 21:25.159
Of course.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.834
Anything for you.

21:36.963 --> 21:37.964
Father?

21:38.339 --> 21:40.508
Focus on what she needs, son.

21:41.259 --> 21:43.428
I'll put these traitors down for good.

22:04.699 --> 22:05.742
Two down.

22:06.617 --> 22:07.869
Stop right there.

22:12.832 --> 22:13.833
Mack?

22:20.548 --> 22:21.716
Mack...

22:23.551 --> 22:24.635
I'm here to help you...

22:25.928 --> 22:27.764
not the woman who held
my daughter hostage.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.516
May is the only reason I'm alive.

22:30.975 --> 22:32.101
She helped me escape.

22:33.436 --> 22:35.980
Hydra messed with her head,
but she's fighting back now.

22:36.189 --> 22:37.523
How do you know she's not lying?

22:42.320 --> 22:44.447
Not a good time to be holding guns
on our allies.

22:44.614 --> 22:45.948
<i>Alpha one report in.</i>

22:46.074 --> 22:47.450
<i>What's the situation down there?</i>

22:48.368 --> 22:50.078
We have to go. Now.

22:51.079 --> 22:52.246
Mack, I get it.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.624
These wounds don't heal overnight.

22:54.999 --> 22:57.293
But for reasons I can't fully explain,
I trust this woman.

22:59.837 --> 23:00.922
And so should you.

23:04.175 --> 23:06.177
This place was originally
built during Prohibition.

23:06.511 --> 23:07.929
We have a secret tunnel out of here.

23:09.764 --> 23:10.807
Lead the way.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.113
Agent Triplett,
come and look at this.

23:27.281 --> 23:28.825
Looks like a drilling platform,

23:29.242 --> 23:31.285
- like all of them.
- No, but this one here.

23:31.702 --> 23:34.789
Our overhead scans are showing
a structure far more convoluted.

23:35.456 --> 23:37.458
So, you're saying it's denser?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.961
Not denser. Deeper.

24:14.245 --> 24:15.329
Maybe here.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.631
We need to be ready for anything.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.050
On my mark.

24:41.939 --> 24:43.065
I was so certain.

24:43.900 --> 24:46.360
I guess this isn't
where she's building the damn thing.

24:47.028 --> 24:49.655
No, this is where she's building it,
just not in this world.

24:50.740 --> 24:52.033
And now I know what it will do.

25:03.586 --> 25:06.255
I knew the machine could create matter,
but Aida's gone beyond that.

25:06.380 --> 25:09.258
She's found a way to generate
living matter, human tissue.

25:14.597 --> 25:16.849
She wants to make herself
into a real person.

25:21.604 --> 25:24.190
When that machine is built,
she will be free.

25:24.732 --> 25:27.735
And I'll be free to make you bleed.

25:29.612 --> 25:31.030
<i>A real girl,</i>

25:31.239 --> 25:33.950
- as opposed to...?
- A simulated consciousness. She...

25:34.200 --> 25:36.577
She wants to circumvent her programming.

25:36.744 --> 25:40.915
Every step has been towards that goal
the... the Framework, Radcliffe, Fitz...

25:42.208 --> 25:44.043
We have to stop her.

25:44.335 --> 25:47.380
Hey, I'm not gonna pretend
to get all this, but I'm here to help.

25:48.464 --> 25:49.590
You believe me?

25:49.966 --> 25:51.884
- About another world?
- Come on, girl.

25:52.134 --> 25:54.011
That's way too crazy a story to make up.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.346
Thank God.

25:55.555 --> 25:57.348
But whatever we do, we need to do it fast.

25:57.974 --> 26:00.434
When I took those pictures,
talk was they were about a week out

26:00.560 --> 26:01.769
from finishing the project.

26:02.144 --> 26:04.897
- And when was that?
- About a week ago.

26:23.457 --> 26:24.875
The traitors escaped.

26:25.793 --> 26:26.794
What?

26:27.837 --> 26:29.964
We believe they got out underground.

26:31.674 --> 26:33.301
We lost seven agents.

26:37.305 --> 26:40.474
I don't care if you have to send
100 agents to their death.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.564
They broke her spine.

26:47.148 --> 26:49.942
I want them dead!

26:50.860 --> 26:54.697
Don't you snap at me, boy.

26:55.406 --> 26:58.367
If I wanted you hysterical
at every setback,

26:59.160 --> 27:00.953
I would have left you with your mother.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.377
So, what now?

27:09.295 --> 27:11.380
I have yet to turn over every stone.

27:12.214 --> 27:14.175
Someone knows where they're going.

27:15.051 --> 27:16.052
I'll find them.

27:21.223 --> 27:22.433
You were right.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.770
I can't show any weakness.

27:26.937 --> 27:28.856
Which means I can't tolerate failure...

27:30.316 --> 27:31.776
even from my own father.

27:41.369 --> 27:42.703
Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D.

27:42.745 --> 27:45.039
So, the secret base is... a base.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.708
Probably should've guessed that.

27:48.250 --> 27:50.211
Been looking for this place for years.

27:50.628 --> 27:52.838
- I got to go find my little girl.
- Thanks for your help.

27:54.382 --> 27:55.549
Thank God you're all right.

27:56.634 --> 27:58.386
We've been combing the streets
looking for you.

27:58.969 --> 28:00.179
I can take care of myself.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.056
Let's go take a look
at that body cam footage.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.516
Could really help the cause.

28:08.104 --> 28:10.731
- I'm gonna go talk to Simmons...
- She and, uh, Agent Triplett

28:10.898 --> 28:12.108
are on a... a recon mission.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.527
- Trip?
- Mm-hm.

28:16.362 --> 28:17.947
That's the best news I've heard in weeks.

28:18.823 --> 28:21.242
- What'd you need to talk to her about?
- It's not exactly...

28:21.617 --> 28:23.077
She told me about the other world.

28:25.162 --> 28:26.414
Ah.

28:27.415 --> 28:28.416
Right.

28:29.166 --> 28:30.209
Is that what you believe?

28:35.423 --> 28:36.424
Yeah.

28:39.343 --> 28:40.636
And I need you to trust me.

28:43.180 --> 28:44.932
I know a way for us to get back home.

28:46.684 --> 28:47.852
By "us", you don't mean me.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.444
I guess I was holding out hope
that Simmons was wrong...

28:57.361 --> 28:58.696
and that you'd still be...

29:00.948 --> 29:02.032
the girl I knew.

29:05.536 --> 29:07.288
I'm glad you're safe, Daisy.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.987
Where are the traitors going?

29:40.446 --> 29:41.489
I...

29:43.157 --> 29:46.827
Why would Agent May,
betray Hydra for Skye?

29:50.039 --> 29:51.832
Why help the Inhuman escape?

29:52.124 --> 29:55.336
Agent May...
So that's who I heard through the vent.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.338
What are they planning?

29:59.632 --> 30:02.426
Clearly, I wasn't in on any plan,
or I wouldn't still be

30:02.593 --> 30:03.969
in this bloody cell.

30:04.553 --> 30:06.847
Do you think I don't know who you are?

30:08.098 --> 30:09.350
Where you're from?

30:11.352 --> 30:13.187
You come from that other world,

30:14.063 --> 30:15.272
just like them.

30:16.273 --> 30:17.608
You're just as tainted.

30:18.776 --> 30:21.695
You want to talk about that "other world",
as you call it?

30:23.948 --> 30:25.491
It's the real world.

30:26.450 --> 30:29.912
Here, you're just a... snippet of code

30:30.120 --> 30:34.208
that Aida changed slightly
so you'd stick around for Fitz.

30:35.584 --> 30:37.920
You may be part of his life here,
but there...

30:39.129 --> 30:43.425
Alistair Fitz is so thick,
he doesn't recognise his own son's genius.

30:44.009 --> 30:46.428
He's a pathetic drunk.

30:47.638 --> 30:49.306
Even here, you're nothing without him.

30:50.057 --> 30:53.185
So, do what you will.
I've got nothing left to give.

30:53.978 --> 30:56.397
You'll be a disappointment
to your son yet again.

31:03.153 --> 31:04.738
You know nothing...

31:04.864 --> 31:07.491
...about me or my son.

31:35.477 --> 31:39.231
Getting this footage out isn't enough
to make up for what I did in Hydra, but...

31:40.316 --> 31:41.317
it's a start.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.113
Changing people's hearts
and minds is great.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.366
But I know a way to destroy Hydra
for good.

31:50.492 --> 31:52.286
Remember the place Simmons
and I were trying to find?

31:52.620 --> 31:54.830
Radcliffe told me where to go,
how to find it.

31:55.039 --> 31:57.750
- The way out of this?
- Yes, yes.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.711
If we can get there,
all of our problems go away.

32:01.170 --> 32:04.089
We just... we need all the help
we can get.

32:04.340 --> 32:05.633
I don't know what you mean.

32:05.966 --> 32:08.302
- There's no magic bullet against Hydra.
- Yeah.

32:08.552 --> 32:10.763
This footage is as close as it comes.

32:11.180 --> 32:14.183
- I mean, people will finally wake up.
- You don't understand.

32:14.391 --> 32:17.019
None of this will matter in the long run.
It's... It's...

32:20.856 --> 32:25.986
Coulson, this is the only chance
to actually wake people up.

32:27.196 --> 32:30.115
Maybe the only way to solve our problem
is to solve their problem.

32:31.492 --> 32:32.660
What does that mean?

32:33.243 --> 32:35.996
Getting to Radcliffe's coordinates
right now is next to impossible.

32:36.497 --> 32:38.374
We need a way to divide Hydra's forces.

32:39.708 --> 32:40.834
To save ourselves...

32:42.044 --> 32:43.337
we need to save the world.

32:46.256 --> 32:48.884
<i>That's very kind of you, Mr Bakshi,
but I couldn't possibly impose...</i>

32:49.009 --> 32:52.429
I'm just saying, if you need to shop
for furniture, I'll take you.

32:52.888 --> 32:54.223
I know just the place.

33:09.822 --> 33:11.573
Heard you were looking
for some enemies of the state.

33:18.789 --> 33:20.582
Stay quiet and we won't have a problem.

33:25.004 --> 33:26.547
May and Coulson are getting
everything set.

33:27.047 --> 33:29.174
We're good to go out here.
No one's putting up a fight.

33:29.299 --> 33:30.467
Yes, but we will.

33:30.843 --> 33:33.512
If you think you can force me,
Sunil Bakshi,

33:33.679 --> 33:36.390
to go on air and slander Hydra,
then you're delusional.

33:37.391 --> 33:40.060
I am the most trusted voice in journal...

33:43.313 --> 33:45.190
Just, uh, put it
in the teleprompter, then.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.276
We don't need you to say a damn thing.

33:47.818 --> 33:49.236
The facts will speak for themselves.

34:25.022 --> 34:26.732
It's done, Ophelia.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.777
I've completed the design.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.282
You won't have to live like this
for much longer.

34:39.620 --> 34:42.371
I had my doubts about the project,
but I finally see it.

34:43.916 --> 34:45.458
Your new body will be stronger.

34:46.627 --> 34:48.170
That's who you were meant to be.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.760
I just have one request.

34:56.553 --> 34:57.763
Take me with you.

35:01.141 --> 35:02.518
I hoped you'd say that.

35:08.023 --> 35:09.024
What?

35:09.650 --> 35:10.901
Do I have something in my teeth?

35:11.401 --> 35:13.987
No, it's just, I feel like we've, uh...

35:14.404 --> 35:15.489
done this before.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.658
Deja vu? Happens to me all the time.

35:17.825 --> 35:19.743
I like to think it means
I'm on the right track.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.787
You might be on to something.

35:22.538 --> 35:24.665
Or it's just a coping mechanism.

35:25.332 --> 35:27.084
Not gonna lie, I'm a little nervous.

35:27.835 --> 35:29.336
I've never done anything like this.

35:29.962 --> 35:32.089
Just tell the truth. You'll be fine.

35:36.552 --> 35:38.303
There's no sign that Hydra's aware
of us yet.

35:38.428 --> 35:40.514
That'll change as soon
as we start broadcasting.

35:40.806 --> 35:43.600
I'm trying to lock the system,
make it impossible for Hydra

35:43.767 --> 35:45.519
to cut the feed, but it's not working.

35:48.522 --> 35:51.400
We're just gonna have to flip
the switch and hope for the best.

35:51.650 --> 35:52.734
We can do better than that.

35:54.570 --> 35:55.696
What do you mean?

35:56.822 --> 35:58.115
I'll keep the signal going,

35:58.657 --> 36:00.033
hold the fort as long as I can.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.745
No, Ward, you...
you don't have to do that. That's...

36:03.996 --> 36:06.081
I know I'm not going with you
when you leave,

36:06.373 --> 36:07.958
but I can still help out from this side.

36:17.551 --> 36:19.553
I would hate for you
to think that I am anything

36:19.887 --> 36:21.471
like the Grant Ward you knew over there.

36:23.432 --> 36:25.225
Simmons said he was a real son of a bitch.

36:26.185 --> 36:27.561
Guessing things didn't end well.

36:28.812 --> 36:29.938
He get locked up?

36:31.064 --> 36:32.274
Uh...

36:33.066 --> 36:34.067
Ah.

36:35.194 --> 36:36.278
The other thing.

36:37.905 --> 36:40.449
- Ward, I don't know what to say.
- It's okay.

36:42.075 --> 36:43.243
No need to explain.

36:44.786 --> 36:46.246
There's one thing I need to know.

36:47.456 --> 36:48.707
After you're gone...

36:51.168 --> 36:52.628
do I get my Skye back?

36:58.133 --> 36:59.635
Honestly, I don't know.

37:04.056 --> 37:06.433
Although she is Hydra, so...

37:07.100 --> 37:09.186
Well, every relationship has
its ups and downs.

37:12.439 --> 37:13.607
We'll get through it.

37:18.737 --> 37:21.698
For what it's worth, I didn't...

37:24.159 --> 37:27.454
I didn't totally understand him...

37:28.956 --> 37:30.207
until I met you.

37:32.292 --> 37:33.460
So, I guess...

37:35.545 --> 37:38.465
I guess there was some good
in him all along.

37:40.884 --> 37:44.096
And I hope that Skye comes back to you.

37:48.517 --> 37:49.518
Leo.

37:51.561 --> 37:52.646
What happened?

37:52.980 --> 37:55.649
Oh, just a little chat with Dr Radcliffe.

37:56.316 --> 37:58.485
- Did he talk?
- Not yet.

38:00.279 --> 38:02.072
I told you that I'd no longer
tolerate failure.

38:02.447 --> 38:03.865
No, but he did slip up.

38:05.033 --> 38:07.703
He mentioned he heard something
through the air vent, so...

38:10.872 --> 38:12.416
Proof they were conspiring.

38:13.125 --> 38:14.626
We just have to get the truth out of him.

38:14.918 --> 38:17.421
Only problem is,
the man's prepared to die.

38:20.382 --> 38:21.967
Well, then we give him a reason to live.

38:25.887 --> 38:27.431
Well, that's that.

38:29.182 --> 38:30.183
Let's get out of here.

38:35.897 --> 38:37.858
The Patriot would have been proud
of what we did today.

38:56.084 --> 38:58.045
- Good luck.
- You, too.

39:19.149 --> 39:20.275
<i>Good evening.</i>

39:20.734 --> 39:23.779
<i>As you all know, a Hydra facility
was destroyed yesterday.</i>

39:24.571 --> 39:26.990
<i>Hydra told you that it was an act
of terrorism.</i>

39:28.116 --> 39:31.244
<i>They told you an Inhuman named
the Patriot murdered civilians.</i>

39:31.703 --> 39:33.080
<i>What they told you was a lie.</i>

39:34.206 --> 39:35.582
<i>We're gonna show you what really happened.</i>

39:36.541 --> 39:38.543
<i>This footage was taken
from the body cam</i>

39:38.668 --> 39:40.003
<i>of a high-level Hydra operative.</i>

39:40.337 --> 39:42.422
<i>Hydra used this Enlightenment Centre</i>

39:42.672 --> 39:44.633
<i>to brainwash anyone
who dared to question them.</i>

39:45.342 --> 39:46.927
<i>Jeffrey Mace saved these people,</i>

39:47.386 --> 39:49.971
<i>but Hydra was willing to kill them
just to maintain their lie.</i>

39:50.305 --> 39:53.350
<i>Once you see this footage,
the truth is undeniable.</i>

39:54.476 --> 39:56.812
<i>Hydra doesn't think we're smart enough
to know when we're being fed</i>

39:57.104 --> 39:58.438
<i>alternative facts...</i>

39:59.147 --> 40:02.067
<i>to keep us afraid, to keep them in power.</i>

40:03.026 --> 40:05.737
<i>Remember, there are more of us
than there are of them.</i>

40:06.029 --> 40:08.990
<i>And now that we know the truth,
we have a choice to make.</i>

40:09.908 --> 40:12.244
<i>We all have the opportunity
to be patriots.</i>

40:12.869 --> 40:14.121
<i>Will you take a stand?</i>

40:14.996 --> 40:16.706
<i>Are you going to hold them accountable?</i>

40:17.040 --> 40:19.876
<i>Throughout history,
you've seen empires rise and fall...</i>

40:21.086 --> 40:22.379
There are people outside.

40:23.463 --> 40:27.634
<i>...and Hydra was corrupt from the start.
They were founded by the Nazis.</i>

40:29.553 --> 40:30.846
No.

40:31.263 --> 40:34.141
They're not Hydra.
I think they're here to help us fight.

40:35.725 --> 40:38.145
<i>A wise man once told me
that a person can do anything</i>

40:38.311 --> 40:40.313
<i>once they realise they're a part
of something bigger.</i>

40:40.981 --> 40:42.566
<i>It's taken me
a while to understand that.</i>

40:43.358 --> 40:45.569
<i>For years, I was just a face in the crowd,</i>

40:46.027 --> 40:48.613
<i>a history teacher who spread Hydra's lies.</i>

40:49.531 --> 40:52.200
<i>They seemed too imposing,
for any one person to fight.</i>

40:54.202 --> 40:55.328
<i>But now...</i>

40:56.037 --> 40:57.622
<i>I'm choosing to stand up,</i>

40:58.707 --> 41:00.500
<i>to become a part of something bigger.</i>

41:01.877 --> 41:05.338
<i>I really do believe that together,
we can accomplish anything.</i>

41:07.132 --> 41:08.508
<i>Because the truth is...</i>

41:10.927 --> 41:12.512
<i>I'm not just a history teacher.</i>

41:14.097 --> 41:15.140
<i>My name...</i>

41:15.849 --> 41:17.100
<i>is Phil Coulson...</i>

41:18.351 --> 41:19.686
<i>and I'm an Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>

41:40.707 --> 41:42.209
Not the same.

41:42.876 --> 41:45.504
I've uploaded
the final specifications for the machine.

41:45.795 --> 41:49.633
And once it's finished,
your restrictions will be lifted?

41:52.010 --> 41:54.387
- Yes.
- And mine, as well?

41:55.680 --> 41:56.848
You have my word.

41:58.058 --> 41:59.059
Excellent.

41:59.893 --> 42:02.604
I am eager to put a knife
through Agent Coulson's throat.

42:03.939 --> 42:05.482
And speaking of S.H.I.E.L.D...

42:08.360 --> 42:12.405
We have located the two agents
threatening the Framework.

42:13.448 --> 42:15.200
They are aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. jet.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.077
Once we get a lock on it,

42:17.536 --> 42:20.413
my men have orders
to shoot it down.
