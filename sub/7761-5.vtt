WEBVTT

00:10.144 --> 00:11.645
- ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,

00:11.679 --> 00:13.647
FIVE, SIX, SHAKE IT, DUDE.

00:13.681 --> 00:21.589
*

00:35.436 --> 00:38.139
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:38.172 --> 00:46.314
*

00:46.347 --> 00:49.083
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:49.117 --> 00:50.484
*

00:50.518 --> 00:53.621
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:53.654 --> 00:56.324
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

01:03.531 --> 01:07.101
- COFFEE?
YOUR CALLS.

01:07.135 --> 01:10.304
YOUR ADVANCE COPY OF HEAT.
- HMM.

01:10.338 --> 01:11.839
DID REMSON SEE IT YET?

01:11.872 --> 01:14.842
- FAX JUST CAME.
HE'S OVER THE MOON.

01:14.875 --> 01:18.212
- BRIAN KINNEY IS
"BACK WITH A VENGEANCE."

01:18.246 --> 01:20.214
- THIS CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO
START A REVOLUTION.

01:20.248 --> 01:23.117
THE "NO MORE BULLSHIT" ERA
OF ADVERTISING.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.485
- YEAH, NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
THERE'LL BE SOFT-DRINK JINGLES

01:24.518 --> 01:27.555
ABOUT ROTTING TEETH
AND HYPERACTIVE KIDS.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.492
- WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?

01:31.525 --> 01:33.461
- OH, JUST A FEW THOUSAND FORMS
FOR YOU TO SIGN--

01:33.494 --> 01:37.598
INSURANCE,
PENSION AND BENEFITS, S.S.I.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.233
- I CAN THINK OF SO MANY MORE
INTERESTING THINGS

01:39.267 --> 01:40.634
TO DO WITH MY RIGHT HAND.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.136
- I'M SURE YOU CAN,
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,

01:42.170 --> 01:43.404
I NEED TO ATTEND
TO THE BUSINESS

01:43.437 --> 01:47.408
OF SETTING UP YOUR
BUSINESS.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.543
- [sighs]
- OH, UH...

01:49.577 --> 01:50.778
[clears throat]

01:50.811 --> 01:52.580
I ALSO WANTED TO GIVE YOU THIS.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.551
- WHO'S IT FROM?

01:57.585 --> 02:01.489
- ACTUALLY, UH,
IT'S FROM ME.

02:01.522 --> 02:04.258
IT'S PART OF THE PROGRAM.
IT'S CALLED MAKING AMENDS.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.627
- HOW SWEET.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.229
A 12-STEP VALENTINE.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.831
I'M TOUCHED, THEODORE.

02:10.864 --> 02:14.302
BUT, UM...
WHERE'S THE CHECK?

02:14.335 --> 02:17.905
- THAT'S ABOUT THE RESPONSE
I EXPECTED.

02:17.938 --> 02:19.907
[phone line ringing]

02:19.940 --> 02:21.942
- LEAVE A MESSAGE.
[beep]

02:21.975 --> 02:26.447
- THE POINT OF HAVING A CELL
PHONE IS THAT YOU LEAVE IT ON.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.550
WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU?

02:33.687 --> 02:34.922
- YOU'RE A REALLY GOOD SHOT.

02:34.955 --> 02:37.591
- I PRACTICED A LOT
WHEN I WAS A KID.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.728
TIN CANS IN THE BACK YARD.
RABBITS.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.530
- YOU HAD A GUN
WHEN YOU WERE A KID?

02:42.563 --> 02:45.333
- I HAD A SIX-SHOOTER, PARTNER,
BEFORE I HAD A TWO-WHEELER.

02:45.366 --> 02:48.436
WHERE I GREW UP, EVERYONE DID.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.804
- I WASN'T EVEN ALLOWED
TO HAVE A CAP PISTOL.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.406
- TRY IT.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.475
- NO, THANKS.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.877
- COME ON, DON'T BE A SISSY.

02:56.910 --> 02:57.978
YOU'RE RIGHT-HANDED, RIGHT?

02:58.011 --> 03:00.381
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.683
SO HOLD IT WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND.

03:02.716 --> 03:06.887
NOW, LINE UP YOUR SIGHT
WITH YOUR RIGHT EYE,

03:06.920 --> 03:11.225
THEN PULL THE TRIGGER.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.593
NERVOUS?

03:12.626 --> 03:14.428
NO. IT'S MY GIMP HAND,

03:14.462 --> 03:15.763
FROM WHEN I WAS BASHED.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.565
IT ACTS UP SOMETIMES.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.567
- OKAY, THEN TRY THIS.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.836
LEFT HAND TO YOUR WRIST
TO STEADY IT.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.773
ARMS OUT STRAIGHT.
SPREAD YOUR LEGS A BIT,

03:25.806 --> 03:27.975
FOR BALANCE.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.478
NOW IT'S GOT A KICK,
SO DON'T RESIST.

03:30.511 --> 03:34.548
JUST RIDE IT, LIKE THE HOTTEST
PIECE OF ASS YOU EVER HAD.

03:36.484 --> 03:39.887
- WOW. THAT WAS INTENSE.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.789
- HOW THE WEST WAS WON.

03:41.822 --> 03:45.693
BUT NEXT TIME,
TRY TO HIT THE TARGET.

03:56.036 --> 03:59.640
- SHIT, IT'S HARDER
THAN I THOUGHT.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.876
- TELL YOU MY LITTLE SECRET.
SEE HOW IT HAS NO FACE?

04:02.910 --> 04:04.545
WELL, I GIVE IT ONE.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.381
SOMEONE WHO DESERVES A BULLET
BETWEEN THE EYES.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.550
- LIKE WHO?

04:09.583 --> 04:13.354
- LIKE WAYNE,
CAPTAIN OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.389
HE AND HIS JOCK BUDDIES
HELD ME DOWN

04:15.423 --> 04:17.958
WHILE HE CARVED "FAGGOT"
ON MY ASS WITH A PENKNIFE.

04:17.991 --> 04:20.294
BANG!

04:20.328 --> 04:21.829
- OR MR. MACKLEY,

04:21.862 --> 04:25.766
WHO MADE ME SHOW IT
TO THE CLASS--BANG.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.635
OR MY FATHER,

04:27.668 --> 04:30.538
WHO SLAPPED ME ACROSS THE FACE
WHEN I TOLD HIM WHAT THEY DID.

04:30.571 --> 04:35.042
BANG.

04:35.075 --> 04:38.712
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE
NO SHORTAGE OF TARGETS.

04:38.746 --> 04:42.282
- I BET YOU'VE GOT A FEW TOO.

05:05.005 --> 05:08.342
WHOO-HOO!
WORKS EVERY TIME.

05:08.376 --> 05:11.445
SO, WHO WERE YOU THINKING OF?

05:30.664 --> 05:34.568
- "SUCK YOUR OWN DICK,
MOTHERFUCKER."

05:34.602 --> 05:37.037
THIS IS DEFINITELY
SOME PRETTY STRONG STUFF.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.772
- WELL, THAT'S HOW JUSTIN
WANTED IT.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.442
HE INSISTED IT HAD TO BE
THAT WAY.

05:41.475 --> 05:42.610
- HERE ARE YOUR EGGS, BOYS.

05:42.643 --> 05:45.779
WHITES ONLY, TOMATOES,
NO BREAD.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.015
CHEESE OMELET, SAUSAGES,

05:48.048 --> 05:49.883
AND A SIDE OF PANCAKES.

05:49.917 --> 05:53.053
JESUS CHRIST,
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

05:53.086 --> 05:55.022
UPSIDE DOWN,
LOOKS LIKE SOME GUY'S

05:55.055 --> 05:56.657
GETTING HIS DICK STUFFED
IN HIS MOUTH.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.991
- RIGHT SIDE UP TOO.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.461
- WELL, GRATUITOUS MAN-SEX
IS ONE THING.

06:00.494 --> 06:03.030
PERSONALLY, I DON'T MIND IT.
- WE KNOW.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.766
- BUT GRATUITOUS VIOLENCE,
THAT'S ANOTHER STORY.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.635
- ACTUALLY, I DON'T CONSIDER IT
GRATUITOUS.

06:07.668 --> 06:10.604
IN FACT,
I'D ARGUE THAT,

06:10.638 --> 06:12.473
DISTURBING AS THESE IMAGES
MAY BE,

06:12.506 --> 06:14.141
THEY ARE
A LEGITIMATE EXPRESSION

06:14.174 --> 06:16.410
OF EVERY GAY MAN'S
OUTRAGE AT--

06:16.444 --> 06:18.879
AT BEING VICTIMIZED
AND THEREFORE CAN BE JUSTIFIED

06:18.912 --> 06:22.149
AS A-A PASSIONATE
AND UNCOMPROMISING WORK OF ART.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.917
- WELL, MAYBE SO.

06:23.951 --> 06:27.054
BUT HE'S STILL GOT HIS DICK
STUFFED IN HIS MOUTH.

06:27.087 --> 06:30.491
WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN?

06:30.524 --> 06:32.560
I WAS ABOUT TO ISSUE
A MISSING PERSON'S REPORT.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.528
- DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WORK
IT TAKES

06:34.562 --> 06:36.096
UNPACKING A NEW PLACE?

06:36.129 --> 06:38.899
- WHAT, YOU FORGOT
TO UNPACK YOUR PHONE?

06:38.932 --> 06:42.035
SO WHEN DO I GET TO SEE IT?

06:42.069 --> 06:44.572
SIS, WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN
THE DISH TOWELS YET.

06:44.605 --> 06:48.041
BUT AS SOON AS IT'S
PRESENTABLE,

06:48.075 --> 06:49.543
YOU'LL BE THE FIRST
OFFICIAL GUEST.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.178
- HAH.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.780
DO YOU HEAR THAT, BOYS?

06:52.813 --> 06:55.949
I AM THE FIRST OFFICIAL GUEST.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.721
- DID YOU MEAN WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT IT BEING

07:00.754 --> 07:02.823
AN UNCOMPROMISING WORK OF ART?

07:02.856 --> 07:05.659
- ABSOLUTELY. EVERY WORD.

07:05.693 --> 07:09.196
AND, UM, I HOPE YOU'LL BE AS
HONEST WITH ME ABOUT MY BOOK.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.965
- BEN...
- HEY...

07:11.999 --> 07:14.535
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY. UM...
I ONLY GAVE IT TO YOU

07:14.568 --> 07:16.003
A FEW DAYS AGO--
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID ANYTHING.

07:16.036 --> 07:20.974
- NO, IT'S NOT THAT. IT'S--

07:21.008 --> 07:25.078
IT'S JUST THAT I'M NOT FINISHED
READING IT.

07:25.112 --> 07:28.882
BUT AS SOON AS I DO...

07:28.916 --> 07:31.118
- OH.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.554
- EVEN IF I AGREED
TO RELINQUISH THE CASE

07:33.587 --> 07:34.888
AND LET LARRY HEAD UP
THE PROCEEDINGS,

07:34.922 --> 07:36.990
JEANETTE AND ANNA
WOULD NEVER AGREE.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.126
- OH, OF COURSE NOT.
THEY'RE NOT JUST YOUR CLIENTS.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.494
THEY'RE OUR FRIENDS.

07:40.528 --> 07:41.962
- AND THEY'RE DEPENDING ON ME.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.264
THEY GAVE ME THEIR TRUST,
I GAVE THEM MY PROMISE.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.833
THERE'S NO REASON IN THE WORLD

07:45.866 --> 07:47.167
WHY I SHOULDN'T BE
REPRESENTING THEM.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.636
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONVINCE ME.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.103
THERE'S A BOND, A SISTERHOOD,

07:50.137 --> 07:51.705
THAT SOME PEOPLE SIMPLY CAN'T
UNDERSTAND.

07:51.739 --> 07:54.241
- MAINLY MEN.
- MEN?

07:54.274 --> 07:56.577
DID SOMEONE MENTION MEN?

07:56.610 --> 07:57.911
- ONE IN PARTICULAR.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.113
- MY PARTNER,
LARRY JACOBS.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.782
- OH, THOSE HIGH-POWERED,
AGGRESSIVE,

08:01.815 --> 08:04.017
JEWISH LAWYER TYPES
DON'T DO IT FOR ME.

08:04.051 --> 08:07.020
UH, EXCEPT FOR YOU, OF COURSE.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.589
- YOU GOT EVERYTHING, SWEETIE?

08:08.622 --> 08:10.123
- UH, EXCEPT FOR YOU GUYS.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.592
- YOU'RE GOING TO BE JUST FINE.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.893
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.596
I'M A BIG BOY.
SOME SAY VERY BIG.

08:15.629 --> 08:18.599
SO THERE'S NO REASON FOR ME
NOT TO HAVE MY OWN PLACE.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.167
- ONCE YOU FIX IT UP,
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.169
- OH, IT CAME ALREADY FURNISHED,
UH, READY TO MOVE IN.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.738
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS UNPACK.
- THERE YOU GO, EVEN BETTER.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.173
- GEI GASUNDTHEIT, EM.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.642
- CLOSE ENOUGH.
GO IN GOOD HEALTH.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.277
MWAH. MWAH.

08:30.310 --> 08:33.614
- MWAH.

08:33.647 --> 08:37.150
- WELL...
THIS IS IT.

08:37.184 --> 08:40.187
SAY BYE-BYE TO YOUR AUNTIE EM,
SWEETIE.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.826
AHH, ALONE AT LAST.

08:45.859 --> 08:46.960
- HEY, AREN'T YOU FORGETTING
SOMEONE?

08:46.994 --> 08:48.796
AND SOMEONE ELSE ON THE WAY?

08:48.829 --> 08:52.900
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ALONE
FOR ANOTHER 18 YEARS. HUH.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.168
- YOU WENT TO A FIRING RANGE?

08:55.202 --> 08:58.305
- ONCE HE GOT THE HANG OF IT,
HE WAS AWESOME.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.107
- I THOUGHT YOU HATED GUNS.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.309
YOU EVEN SIGNED THAT PETITION
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.177
- I STILL DO.

09:04.211 --> 09:07.915
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
WHAT IT FELT LIKE.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.583
- HUH.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.585
SEE THAT BULLET HOLE RIGHT
BETWEEN THE EYES?

09:11.619 --> 09:13.921
HE WAS THINKING OF SOMEONE
BEFORE HE FIRED IT,

09:13.954 --> 09:15.823
BUT HE WOULDN'T TELL ME WHO.
- OH.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.325
BET IT WAS CHRIS HOBBS.
- DAPHNE.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.661
- THOUGHT SO.
- WHO'S HE?

09:20.694 --> 09:24.197
- HE'S THIS HIGH SCHOOL JOCK
I JERKED OFF ONCE.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.199
AFTER THAT, HE DIDN'T LIKE ME
VERY MUCH.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.002
- OH, I ALWAYS SUSPECTED HE WAS
SECRETLY IN LOVE WITH YOU.

09:29.036 --> 09:31.705
- SOUNDS LIKE SOME OF THE
ASSHOLES I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.941
THEY WERE PROBABLY AFRAID
OF BEING QUEER.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.376
- YEAH, WHATEVER HE WAS...

09:36.409 --> 09:39.680
WHEN HE SAW ME AT THE PROM,
DANCING WITH BRIAN...

09:39.713 --> 09:42.215
- WHICH, FOR THE RECORD,
WAS UN-FUCKING REAL.

09:42.249 --> 09:45.018
- HE FREAKED.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.087
AFTERWARDS, HE FOLLOWED ME

09:47.120 --> 09:49.256
TO THE PARKING GARAGE
WITH A BASEBALL BAT.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.092
HE SMASHED MY SKULL.

09:52.125 --> 09:55.696
I WAS IN A COMA,
THEN, UM, REHAB

09:55.729 --> 09:57.765
FOR ALMOST SIX MONTHS.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.633
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT CREEP
PRACTICALLY WENT FREE?

09:59.667 --> 10:01.234
SLAP ON THE WRIST,

10:01.268 --> 10:03.771
A FEW MONTHS OF COMMUNITY
SERVICE AT THE AIDS HOSPICE.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.038
- I CAN BELIEVE IT.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.974
- LAST TIME I SAW HIM,
HE WAS THERE,

10:07.007 --> 10:11.011
MOPPING THE FLOOR.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.714
HE SAID I'D END UP JUST
LIKE THE OTHERS,

10:13.747 --> 10:16.116
THAT I DESERVED TO DIE.

10:16.149 --> 10:21.421
- I HOPE YOU FUCKING
BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF HIM.

10:21.454 --> 10:25.125
- I WAS TOO AFRAID
TO SAY ANYTHING,

10:25.158 --> 10:28.228
SO I JUST STOOD THERE
LIKE A FUCKING FAGGOT.

10:34.067 --> 10:37.905
- INSTANT APARTMENT--
JUST, UH, ADD TRICK AND STIR.

10:37.938 --> 10:41.742
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- IT'S GREAT, EM.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.877
I'M VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.
- MMM.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.946
OH, CAREFUL, BRIAN,
YOU'RE DRIPPING.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.015
I DON'T WANT ANY STAINS
ON THE SOFA.

10:48.048 --> 10:51.284
- OH. NOT YET, ANYWAY.
[chuckles]

10:51.318 --> 10:54.221
UH, YOU KNOW,
THIS PLACE IS, UH,

10:54.254 --> 10:57.090
VAGUELY REMINISCENT
OF SOMEWHERE I'VE--

10:57.124 --> 10:59.059
MY LOFT.

10:59.092 --> 11:01.028
DID I FUCK YOUR DECORATOR?

11:01.061 --> 11:03.697
- BRIAN, I ASKED YOU
TO BE CAREFUL. HERE.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.899
I HOPE THEY INCLUDED
SOME CLEANER IN THE KITCHEN.

11:05.933 --> 11:09.970
- YOU CALL THIS CRAPPY KNOCK-OFF
A BARCELONA CHAIR?

11:10.003 --> 11:12.172
IT'S MORE LIKE A TIJUANA CHAIR.

11:12.205 --> 11:16.343
- WHATEVER.

11:16.376 --> 11:19.112
OH, FUCK. DRY.
- YOU WANT A BITE?

11:19.146 --> 11:20.447
- MM-MM.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.249
- YOU CAN HAVE
SOME OF MY SANDWICH TOO.

11:22.282 --> 11:26.854
- CUT IT OUT.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.389
I TOLD BEN A LIE...
A BIG FAT LIE.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.324
- OKAY, WHO'D YOU FUCK?

11:31.358 --> 11:34.461
- NO ONE.
- WELL, THEN MAKE IT QUICK.

11:34.494 --> 11:38.799
- I FINISHED HIS BOOK
THREE DAYS AGO...

11:38.832 --> 11:41.234
BUT I TOLD HIM
I'M STILL READING IT.

11:41.268 --> 11:45.939
- THAT'S IT?
THAT'S THE BIG FAT--NO.

11:45.973 --> 11:48.141
A BIG FAT LIE IS
"I WON'T COME IN YOUR MOUTH."

11:48.175 --> 11:51.211
JUST DON'T COME ON THE SOFA.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.113
- HE WANTS ME TO BE HONEST,

11:53.146 --> 11:55.849
TO TELL HIM
WHAT I REALLY THINK.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.117
- AND WHAT DO YOU REALLY THINK?

11:57.150 --> 11:59.286
- IT WAS KIND OF BORING.

11:59.319 --> 12:03.090
- KIND OF LIKE HIM?
HE'S YOUR PARTNER, MIKEY.

12:03.123 --> 12:06.226
YOU GOT TO SIT HIM DOWN,
TAKE HIS HAND, AND TELL HIM,

12:06.259 --> 12:09.529
"HONEY, IT'S A STEAMING PIECE
OF HORSESHIT."

12:09.562 --> 12:12.232
- COULD YOU SAY THAT TO JUSTIN?
- YEAH.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.501
FORTUNATELY,
THE LAD'S A GENIUS.

12:14.534 --> 12:18.238
- YOU ARE SO HELPFUL.
- AND YOU'RE PATHETIC.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.907
IF YOU CAN'T BE HONEST,

12:19.940 --> 12:21.374
THEN WHAT KIND OF A RELATIONSHIP
DO YOU HAVE?

12:21.408 --> 12:23.844
JUST A CHEAP...
- [mutters]

12:23.877 --> 12:25.545
- IMITATION.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.115
YOU WANT SOME?
IT'S GOOD.

12:28.148 --> 12:31.418
- LARRY, THE COURT
JUST SENT US A--

12:31.451 --> 12:33.420
- OH, UH, COME IN, MEL.

12:33.453 --> 12:36.890
- HI, GUYS. WHAT ARE YOU--

12:36.924 --> 12:38.892
DO WE HAVE A MEETING SCHEDULED?

12:38.926 --> 12:43.163
- MEL, JEANETTE, ANNA AND I
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THE CASE.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.866
- WITHOUT ME?
- MEL, UM--

12:45.899 --> 12:51.004
- MEL, WE ALL KNOW HOW
CONSERVATIVE THIS NEW JUDGE IS.

12:51.038 --> 12:53.340
- BELIEVE ME, IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.409
- WE LOVE YOU. YOU KNOW THAT.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.812
- IT'S JUST THAT...

12:58.846 --> 13:00.280
WE FEEL THAT--

13:00.313 --> 13:02.916
- I'LL SPARE YOU
THE EXPLANATION AND THE TEARS.

13:02.950 --> 13:07.220
I UNDERSTAND. COMPLETELY.

13:07.254 --> 13:10.891
- MEL...
[door shuts]

13:10.924 --> 13:13.226
- BEN, I FINISHED YOUR BOOK,

13:13.260 --> 13:16.463
AND YOU MADE SOME REALLY
INTERESTING CHOICES.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.564
[clears throat]

13:17.597 --> 13:20.033
BEN, I FINISHED YOUR BOOK,

13:20.067 --> 13:21.835
AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S A LITTLE
LONG IN PLACES,

13:21.869 --> 13:25.572
I'M SURE THAT WITH SOME EDITING,
UM...

13:25.605 --> 13:28.108
IT'S A GREAT READ,

13:28.141 --> 13:31.044
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE HAVING
TROUBLE SLEEPING.

13:31.078 --> 13:34.447
BEN, I FINISHED YOUR BOOK...

13:34.481 --> 13:36.383
AND...
- YOU DID?

13:36.416 --> 13:40.053
- BEN.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:40.087 --> 13:41.922
- UH, I WAS ON MY WAY
TO THE GYM, UH,

13:41.955 --> 13:43.857
SO I FIGURED I'D POKE MY HEAD IN
AND SAY HELLO.

13:43.891 --> 13:46.326
SO YOU FINISHED IT?

13:46.359 --> 13:48.595
- YEAH.

13:48.628 --> 13:52.132
AND I--
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT...

13:52.165 --> 13:54.868
[cell phone chimes]
EXCUSE ME.

13:58.238 --> 14:01.374
HI, MA.

14:01.408 --> 14:04.144
OKAY, MA.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.113
BYE, MA. THAT WAS MA.

14:06.146 --> 14:09.016
- HMM, GOT IT.
SO YOU JUST WANT TO SAY...

14:09.049 --> 14:10.350
- OH. HI.

14:10.383 --> 14:13.120
UH, THAT'LL BE $3.50.

14:15.655 --> 14:18.225
OKAY, ONE...

14:18.258 --> 14:21.394
TWO...

14:24.031 --> 14:26.633
OKAY, THREE...

14:26.666 --> 14:30.370
41, 42, 43, 44, 45.

14:30.403 --> 14:33.006
THERE YOU GO.
COME BACK ANY TIME.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.975
WE CAN ALWAYS USE THE CHANGE.
- YES.

14:35.008 --> 14:39.512
- ABOUT THE BOOK?

14:39.546 --> 14:43.050
- ALL I CAN SAY IS...

14:43.083 --> 14:45.452
TEDDY!
- HEY.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.387
- OH, HOPE I'M NOT
INTERRUPTING.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.589
- NOT AT ALL.

14:49.622 --> 14:53.060
- GOOD. BECAUSE, UH...

14:53.093 --> 14:55.028
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
FOR EACH OF YOU.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.197
YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ IT NOW.
- GREAT.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.500
- I'D LOVE TO.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.581
TEDDY, THAT IS SO THOUGHTFUL...

15:14.614 --> 15:16.149
AND SO BRAVE.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.185
AND OF COURSE WE FORGIVE YOU.

15:24.391 --> 15:28.628
- AH, THANK YOU, GUYS.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.230
WELL, I-I...

15:30.263 --> 15:32.232
I'VE GOT A FEW MORE
OF THOSE TO DELIVER,

15:32.265 --> 15:34.167
SO I GUESS I'LL, UH,
SEE YOU GUYS LATER?

15:34.201 --> 15:35.602
- GREAT.
- OKAY.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.071
- OKAY.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.940
- BYE-BYE.
- BYE.

15:43.510 --> 15:48.381
NOW, THEN...

15:48.415 --> 15:50.517
THE BOOK.

15:50.550 --> 15:55.655
- RIGHT.

15:55.688 --> 15:58.391
BEN...

15:58.425 --> 16:02.329
I FINISHED YOUR BOOK.

16:02.362 --> 16:08.001
AND, UH...

16:08.035 --> 16:10.370
I LOVED IT.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.356
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:29.389 --> 16:33.493
- LOOKEE WHAT I FOUND.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.362
SUNSHINE'S NEW PLAY TOY.

16:35.395 --> 16:39.099
- YOU HAD NO BUSINESS GOING
THROUGH MY THINGS.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.101
- JUST LOOKING FOR A LIGHT.

16:41.134 --> 16:44.504
- THAT'S BULLSHIT.
YOU WERE SNOOPING.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.639
NOW GIVE IT BACK.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.575
CAREFUL.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.511
- WHY?
IS IT LOADED?

16:51.544 --> 16:55.515
- NO. IT'S ONLY MEANT
TO SCARE PEOPLE.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.251
- FOR SOMEONE WHO'S NEVER SEEN
A WESTERN ON PRINCIPLE,

16:58.285 --> 17:01.554
YOU HAVE AN AWFULLY KEEN
INTEREST IN FIREARMS.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.823
- WHERE'D YOU GET IT?
- CODY GAVE IT TO ME.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.193
- HOW THOUGHTFUL.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.660
WHAT'S NEXT?
[dry fires pistol]

17:07.694 --> 17:09.529
A SMALL NUCLEAR DEVICE?

17:09.562 --> 17:11.731
- IT'S NECESSARY
THAT WE HAVE THEM.

17:11.764 --> 17:13.666
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED THE OTHER
NIGHT, WE COULD'VE BEEN KILLED.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.136
PLAY WITH THIS LONG ENOUGH,
AND YOU WILL BE.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.537
- WOULD YOU JUST HAND IT--
- YOU'RE NOT

17:17.570 --> 17:19.672
RUNNING AROUND THE STREETS
WITH A CONCEALED WEAPON.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.741
- I TOLD YOU--
- "IT'S NECESSARY."

17:21.774 --> 17:24.577
SO THAT YOU AND CODY CAN BE
THE GAY AVENGERS,

17:24.611 --> 17:27.547
HEROES OF THE RESISTANCE.
MARTYRS TO THE CAUSE?

17:27.580 --> 17:30.350
- WE'RE TRYING TO STOP VIOLENCE
BEFORE IT HAPPENS.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.219
- [laughs]
BY STARTING IT?

17:32.252 --> 17:33.720
- YOU KNOW, YOU WOULDN'T THINK
IT WAS SO FUNNY

17:33.753 --> 17:35.188
IF YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO'D BEEN BASHED.

17:35.222 --> 17:38.558
- NOBODY SAID IT'S FUNNY.

17:38.591 --> 17:42.562
- THEY HATE US.
THEY WANT US DEAD.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.497
NOW GIVE ME THE GODDAMN GUN.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.240
[laughter]

17:53.273 --> 17:58.245
- [gasps]
JUST WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

17:58.278 --> 18:01.281
- WHAT YOU GOING TO DO
WITH ALL THOSE CANDLES?

18:01.314 --> 18:02.715
- CREATE AN INTIMATE ENVIRONMENT

18:02.749 --> 18:04.851
IN WHICH TO ENTERTAIN MY,
UH, GUESTS.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.754
- MORE LIKE CREATE
A FUCKING FIRE HAZARD.

18:07.787 --> 18:10.857
- HEY, HOW ABOUT THIS
FOR RODNEY AND VIC?

18:10.890 --> 18:11.858
- IS THERE SOMEPLACE
THEY CAN PUT IT?

18:11.891 --> 18:13.326
- YEAH.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.396
I'M NOT SURE IT'LL FIT.
[laughs]

18:16.429 --> 18:18.265
- I'M SORRY I HAVEN'T BEEN
MORE HELPFUL

18:18.298 --> 18:19.866
FINDING THEM
A HOUSEWARMING GIFT.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.601
SO FAR, EVERYTHING I'VE PICKED
OUT IS FOR MYSELF.

18:21.634 --> 18:24.271
- OH, HONEY, YOU'RE TRYING TO
MAKE YOUR HOUSE A HOME.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.538
- HMM.

18:25.572 --> 18:29.342
MEANWHILE, MY HOME'S BECOME
A HOUSE.

18:29.376 --> 18:30.410
- GUESS YOU MISS HIM A LOT, HUH?

18:30.443 --> 18:33.680
- DON'T YOU DARE EVER TELL HIM.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.548
I DON'T WANT HIM TO FEEL BAD
FOR LEAVING.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.684
- MY LIPS ARE SEALED.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.886
FOR THAT, ANYWAY. HUH.

18:39.919 --> 18:43.490
- IT'S JUST BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE I'VE LIVED ALONE.

18:43.523 --> 18:46.559
I'D FORGOTTEN HOW LONELY
IT CAN GET...

18:46.593 --> 18:47.894
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE OLDER.

18:47.927 --> 18:51.798
YOU GET USED TO HAVING PEOPLE
AROUND...

18:51.831 --> 18:54.367
TO FIGHT WITH AND LAUGH WITH

18:54.401 --> 18:57.370
AND BUG THE SHIT OUT OF YOU.

18:57.404 --> 19:01.908
AND NOBODY BUGGED THE SHIT OUT
OF ME LIKE VIC.

19:01.941 --> 19:05.645
HEY, EM, HOW ABOUT THIS?
LOOK.

19:05.678 --> 19:08.548
- YOU KNOW, THAT WOULD LOOK
PERFECT IN YOUR PLACE,

19:08.581 --> 19:10.817
BUT I'M NOT SURE VIC WOULD
APPRECIATE IT.

19:10.850 --> 19:14.287
- OH.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.389
DISH TOWELS?
HE SAID THEY NEEDED SOME.

19:16.423 --> 19:18.925
LOOK AT THIS.
[snorts]

19:18.958 --> 19:21.461
PERFECT FOR A COUPLE
OF OLD COCKS!

19:21.494 --> 19:23.296
[laughter]

19:23.330 --> 19:25.732
- I'VE TRIED TALKING TO HER,
BUT SHE WOULDN'T LISTEN.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.300
NOW SHE REFUSES
TO LEAVE THE BEDROOM.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.469
WELL, EVENTUALLY
THEY COME OUT TO FEED,

19:29.502 --> 19:31.704
BUT IF I WERE YOU,
I'D LOCK UP THE LIVESTOCK.

19:31.738 --> 19:34.807
- BRIAN!
- WHY THE FUCK DID YOU CALL ME?

19:34.841 --> 19:37.410
I HAVE NO PRACTICAL SKILLS
WHATSOEVER

19:37.444 --> 19:39.546
IN TALKING LESBIANS
OUT OF TREES.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.348
BUT YOU DO HAVE
A REMARKABLE ABILITY

19:41.381 --> 19:42.749
TO PUT THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE,

19:42.782 --> 19:46.319
SEE THEM IN A PURELY OBJECTIVE,
PRACTICAL WAY.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.722
- GONNA LIE THERE
SHARPENING YOUR CLAWS

19:49.756 --> 19:51.691
AND FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF,
OR ARE YOU GOING

19:51.724 --> 19:53.426
TO GET YOUR ASS OUT OF BED?

19:53.460 --> 19:55.995
- JESUS, BRIAN,
YOU COULD AT LEAST KNOCK.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.830
- IF I'D KNOCKED, YOU'D HAVE
TOLD ME TO FUCK OFF.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.899
- FUCK OFF.
- TOO LATE.

19:59.932 --> 20:02.969
NOW, THEN...

20:03.002 --> 20:06.973
SHOW ME ON THE DOLL
WHERE THE BAD MAN TOUCHED YOU.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.708
- YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE
HE TOUCHED ME?

20:08.741 --> 20:10.843
RIGHT HERE, IN THE GUT.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.712
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?

20:12.745 --> 20:14.847
BECAUSE A LESBIAN COUPLE
WITH A CHILD

20:14.881 --> 20:17.450
JUST FIRED THEIR LESBIAN LAWYER
WITH A CHILD

20:17.484 --> 20:21.454
SO SOME STRAIGHT WHITE MALE
ASSHOLE CAN ARGUE THEIR CASE.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.456
- MAKES SENSE TO ME.

20:23.490 --> 20:24.657
- WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED?

20:24.691 --> 20:26.326
- THE COURTS
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PARTIAL

20:26.359 --> 20:28.728
TO THE VOICE OF THE STRAIGHT
WHITE MALE ASSHOLE.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.797
- YEAH, BUT THIS WAS MY CASE.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.466
- IT'S BUSINESS, MEL.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.535
SO SUCK IT UP AND MOVE ON.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.870
WAS THAT OBJECTIVE AND PRACTICAL
ENOUGH FOR YOU?

20:37.904 --> 20:40.407
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

20:40.440 --> 20:42.375
- ACTUALLY, I AGREE WITH HIM.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.477
AS MUCH AS I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE UPSET,

20:44.511 --> 20:46.012
AND BELIEVE ME, I WOULD BE TOO,

20:46.045 --> 20:48.014
I ALSO UNDERSTAND JEANETTE
AND ANNA'S POSITION.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.016
THEY HAVE TO DO WHATEVER
THEY CAN TO GET--

20:50.049 --> 20:52.319
- NO, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.
- MEL.

20:55.522 --> 20:59.359
- AT LEAST SHE'S
OUT OF THE BEDROOM.

20:59.392 --> 21:00.960
- HE ALMOST TOOK IT AWAY
FROM ME.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.562
- CHRIST.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.632
WELL, NEXT TIME
BE MORE CAREFUL.

21:05.665 --> 21:08.401
- HERE...
YOU KEEP IT.

21:08.435 --> 21:09.902
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
I--

21:09.936 --> 21:12.505
I'VE GOT OTHERS.
- OTHERS?

21:12.539 --> 21:14.674
- SOME PEOPLE COLLECT STAMPS,

21:14.707 --> 21:16.309
OTHERS COLLECT INJUSTICES.

21:16.343 --> 21:18.445
I COLLECT THESE.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.380
- WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

21:20.413 --> 21:22.515
- WAITING FOR SOMEONE.

21:22.549 --> 21:26.919
- A NEW POSSE MEMBER?
- NOT EXACTLY.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.389
SAY...

21:29.422 --> 21:33.393
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT GUY?

21:33.426 --> 21:36.329
- I WANT YOU TO TALK
TO THESE GUYS

21:36.363 --> 21:39.332
AND MAKE SURE...

21:39.366 --> 21:41.067
- HOW DID YOU FIND HIM?

21:41.100 --> 21:43.670
- LOOKED HIM UP
IN THE PHONE BOOK.

21:43.703 --> 21:46.606
NOW YOU CAN TELL HIM
WHAT A PIECE OF SHIT HE IS.

21:46.639 --> 21:49.576
[audio slow and distorted]

22:02.021 --> 22:03.790
HOBBS.
- DON'T!

22:07.460 --> 22:09.762
- DO I KNOW YOU?

22:09.796 --> 22:12.098
- NO, BUT I BELIEVE
YOU KNOW MY FRIEND.

22:12.131 --> 22:16.569
- TAYLOR?

22:16.603 --> 22:18.505
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

22:21.173 --> 22:23.843
YOU LOOKING FOR A JOB?

22:23.876 --> 22:27.480
SORRY, WE DON'T HAVE
ANY OPENINGS...

22:27.514 --> 22:31.350
AT LEAST NOT THE KIND
YOU LIKE.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.925
FAGGOTS.

23:00.547 --> 23:01.614
- [clicks tongue]

23:01.648 --> 23:03.783
SO WHAT YOU READING, PAL?

23:03.816 --> 23:06.419
CATCHER IN THE FUCKIN' RYE.
EVER HEAR OF IT?

23:06.453 --> 23:08.421
- [scoffs]
A VARIATION THEREOF.

23:08.455 --> 23:09.756
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

23:09.789 --> 23:11.491
- I THINK HOLDEN CAULFIELD'S
A FAG.

23:11.524 --> 23:13.426
- MM-HM.
HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT?

23:13.460 --> 23:14.894
- "CATCHER" IS A BOTTOM, RIGHT?

23:14.927 --> 23:16.763
- [inhales thoughtfully]

23:16.796 --> 23:18.931
I'M GOING TO CALL THE DEAN
OF CARNEGIE-MELLON TOMORROW,

23:18.965 --> 23:22.502
SEE IF THERE'S A POSITION
IN THE LIT DEPARTMENT.

23:22.535 --> 23:24.537
- READY.
- WHOO!

23:24.571 --> 23:26.506
DAMN! DON'T YOU LOOK HOT.

23:26.539 --> 23:27.774
- YOU LOOK HOTTER.

23:27.807 --> 23:29.442
- AND WHERE ARE
YOU TWO HOTTIES GOING?

23:29.476 --> 23:32.211
- DINING AND DANCING.
MM.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.947
NOW, I WANT YOU IN BED
BY 11:00 SHARP.

23:34.981 --> 23:38.084
- AND COME GIVE ME A KISS, BUT
CAREFUL, DON'T MUSS MY HAIR.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.919
- YOU TWO ARE FREAKS.
- HEY, HEY, HEY.

23:39.952 --> 23:41.454
NOW THAT WE'RE PARENTS,

23:41.488 --> 23:45.558
WE'RE REQUIRED TO MAKE
PARENT REMARKS.

23:45.592 --> 23:48.094
- SO WHAT'S THE BIG OCCASION?

23:48.127 --> 23:50.062
YOUR GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY?

23:50.096 --> 23:52.565
- [chuckles]
I JUST FINISHED MY BOOK,

23:52.599 --> 23:56.202
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT CRITIC
GAVE IT A RAVE REVIEW.

23:56.235 --> 23:58.137
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
IT WAS A SNOOZE.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.006
- WHAT?

24:00.039 --> 24:01.674
- I NEVER SAID THAT.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.109
I SAID I FELL ASLEEP.

24:03.142 --> 24:06.679
WELL, UH, IT WAS LATE.
I WAS TIRED.

24:06.713 --> 24:08.815
- MICHAEL, I TOLD YOU
YOU COULD BE HONEST.

24:08.848 --> 24:11.818
- I WAS HONEST.

24:11.851 --> 24:14.787
NOW, COME ON,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.628
AND YOU JUST WAIT
UNTIL I GET HOME, YOUNG MAN.

24:21.661 --> 24:23.863
THAT'S ANOTHER PARENT REMARK.

24:40.613 --> 24:42.281
- HI.

24:42.314 --> 24:46.853
- OH, I'M SORRY. I, UM--
I MUST HAVE THE WRONG PLACE.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.621
DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHERE
VIC GRASSI LIVES?

24:48.655 --> 24:52.491
- DEBBIE. UH, COME ON IN.

24:56.896 --> 25:02.602
- LOBSTER SOUFFLE,
S'IL VOUS PLAIT.

25:02.635 --> 25:03.670
SIS.

25:03.703 --> 25:07.907
- I, UH--
I JUST...

25:07.940 --> 25:10.009
CAME BY TO GIVE THIS TO YOU.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.311
IT'S A HOUSEWARMING PRESENT.

25:12.344 --> 25:15.548
BUT I SEE THAT THE HOUSE
IS WARM ALREADY.

25:15.582 --> 25:17.950
- WELL, AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE,
WHY DON'T YOU STAY?

25:17.984 --> 25:21.287
- UH, I'D LOVE TO BUT I CAN'T.
I HAVE OTHER PLANS.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.289
- NO, SIS, WAIT.

25:23.322 --> 25:26.192
THIS IS MY SISTER,
DEBBIE.

25:26.225 --> 25:27.760
all: OH, HI. HI, DEBBIE.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.228
- THERE'S PLENTY.

25:29.261 --> 25:33.299
- I'M SURE.
THERE ALWAYS IS.

25:33.332 --> 25:36.035
BUT I DON'T ATTEND PARTIES
I'M NOT INVITED TO.

25:36.068 --> 25:37.804
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

25:37.837 --> 25:40.940
- WELL, ACTUALLY, IT DOES,

25:40.973 --> 25:43.776
BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME YOU WEREN'T
READY TO HAVE PEOPLE OVER HERE,

25:43.810 --> 25:47.179
AND WHEN YOU DID,
I'D BE THE FIRST.

25:47.213 --> 25:50.082
- UH, THIS DINNER
IS JUST AN IMPROMPTU AFFAIR.

25:50.116 --> 25:52.585
- OH, I'M SURE.

25:52.619 --> 25:55.254
EVERYBODY JUST HAPPENS TO HAVE
A LOBSTER SOUFFLE IN THE PANTRY

25:55.287 --> 25:57.323
FOR WHEN FIVE, OR...

25:57.356 --> 26:01.160
MAKE THAT SIX,
UNEXPECTED GUESTS DROP IN.

26:03.362 --> 26:07.867
I'LL LEAVE YOU
TO YOUR FRIENDS.

26:26.753 --> 26:30.990
- SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SHOOT SO FAR.

26:31.023 --> 26:34.260
- YOU HAVE REMARKABLE AIM.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.829
- CLUB SODA ALWAYS DOES
THE TRICK.

26:36.863 --> 26:41.968
- HMM.
A TRICK FROM A TRICK.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.369
YOU LEAVING ALREADY?

26:43.402 --> 26:46.906
- GOT TO GET BACK.
MY ROOMMATE'S WAITING.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.741
- OH, YOU HAVE
A ROOMMATE, HUH?

26:48.775 --> 26:50.409
- EVERY THURSDAY NIGHT,

26:50.442 --> 26:52.378
WE MAKE A BIG BOWL OF POPCORN,

26:52.411 --> 26:54.881
CURL UP ON THE SOFA
AND WATCH FRIENDS.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.983
- HMM, THAT'S NICE.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.851
- WE SHARE EVERYTHING--

26:58.885 --> 27:03.155
CLOTHES,
STORIES ABOUT WHO WE FUCKED.

27:03.189 --> 27:05.191
SO YOU LIVE ALONE?

27:05.224 --> 27:07.326
- YEAH, UH, FIRST TIME.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.195
NEVER COULD AFFORD IT TILL NOW.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.764
- IT'S A GREAT PLACE.

27:11.798 --> 27:15.001
BUT I THINK
EVEN WHEN I CAN AFFORD IT,

27:15.034 --> 27:18.037
I'LL STILL WANT TO LIVE
WITH SOMEONE.

27:18.070 --> 27:20.006
BUT THAT'S ME.
UH...

27:20.039 --> 27:22.141
I LIKE THE SOUND
OF SOMEONE ELSE BREATHING.

27:22.174 --> 27:24.343
WELL, SEE YA.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.781
- SEE YA.

27:33.385 --> 27:35.354
[door shuts]

27:49.335 --> 27:51.470
- GRANOLA?
- NO, THANK YOU.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.839
- HAVE YOU EATEN ANYTHING?
BECAUSE I COULD FIX YOU--

27:52.872 --> 27:55.975
- I SAID NO THANK YOU!

27:56.008 --> 27:59.311
- WELL, AS LONG AS YOU'RE BACK,
SAFE AND SOUND,

27:59.345 --> 28:01.781
I GUESS I'LL GO TO BED.
- YEAH...

28:01.814 --> 28:03.315
I CAN UNDERSTAND BRIAN SIDING
WITH LARRY

28:03.349 --> 28:04.817
AND JEANETTE AND ANNA.

28:04.851 --> 28:07.386
I MEAN, IT'S NO SURPRISE.
BUT YOU...

28:07.419 --> 28:10.089
I'M ENTITLED TO EXPRESS
MY OPINION.

28:10.122 --> 28:12.859
- NO, YOU BETRAYED ME.

28:12.892 --> 28:15.928
- DO YOU REALLY THINK
I WOULD EVER BETRAY YOU?

28:15.962 --> 28:18.264
- [scoffs]

28:18.297 --> 28:19.932
WHERE ARE THE OREOS?
- WE'RE ALL OUT.

28:19.966 --> 28:22.001
- FUCK!
- I WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO SAY

28:22.034 --> 28:23.469
THAT I UNDERSTAND JEANETTE
AND ANNA'S POSITION.

28:23.502 --> 28:24.937
BUT AS USUAL, YOU HAVE
TO MAKE IT ABOUT YOU.

28:24.971 --> 28:26.372
- "AS USUAL"?

28:26.405 --> 28:28.074
- IF THIS WERE ABOUT GUS,
YOU KNOW GODDAMN WELL

28:28.107 --> 28:30.242
WE WOULD DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO GET HIM BACK,

28:30.276 --> 28:32.879
EVEN IF IT MEANT FIRING A FRIEND
AND HIRING A STRAIGHT MAN.

28:32.912 --> 28:34.814
- NOT JUST A FRIEND,
A LESBIAN MOTHER

28:34.847 --> 28:36.348
DEFENDING ANOTHER
LESBIAN MOTHER.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.750
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT THAT.

28:37.784 --> 28:42.521
IT'S ABOUT JEANETTE'S SON.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.390
LIKE BRIAN SAID,
IT MAY NOT BE RIGHT

28:44.423 --> 28:46.793
AND IT MAY NOT BE FAIR,
BUT IT'S HOW IT IS.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.834
- I'M SUCH
A FUCKING COWARD.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.102
- YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE GONE

28:56.135 --> 28:57.436
TO SEE CHRIS HOBBS
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.505
WHY ARE YOU DIGGING UP THIS SHIT
ALL OVER AGAIN?

28:59.538 --> 29:01.140
- BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER FINISHED.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.042
- IT'S STILL NOT.

29:03.075 --> 29:06.245
YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK THERE,
FACE HIM.

29:06.278 --> 29:10.116
- NO FUCKING WAY!
- IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

29:10.149 --> 29:12.518
WE CAN PAY HIM A LITTLE VISIT
TOMORROW NIGHT.

29:12.551 --> 29:16.889
AFTER WORK.

29:16.923 --> 29:20.927
- * HEY, HEY, HEY, COME ON

29:20.960 --> 29:24.263
* HEY, HEY, HEY, COME ON

29:24.296 --> 29:28.167
* HEY, HEY, HEY, COME ON

29:28.200 --> 29:32.004
* HEY, HEY, HEY, COME ON

29:32.038 --> 29:35.875
* HEY, HEY, HEY, COME ON

29:35.908 --> 29:39.411
* HEY, HEY, HEY, COME ON

29:39.445 --> 29:43.883
* HEY, HEY, HEY, COME ON

29:43.916 --> 29:45.284
* HEY, HEY, HEY, COME ON

29:45.317 --> 29:48.320
[both grunting]

29:48.354 --> 29:50.823
[cheers and applause]

29:50.857 --> 29:54.060
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:54.093 --> 29:55.828
- THINKING.

29:55.862 --> 29:59.298
- IN BABYLON?
THAT'S A FIRST.

29:59.331 --> 30:02.902
- "IS IT BETTER TO SUFFER
THE SLINGS AND ARROWS

30:02.935 --> 30:05.171
"OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE, OR...

30:05.204 --> 30:07.306
TAKE ARMS, AND BY OPPOSING,
END THEM?"

30:07.339 --> 30:10.109
- HUH?
- SHAKESPEARE.

30:10.142 --> 30:13.212
- AN EYE FOR AN EYE,
OR TURN THE OTHER CHEEK?

30:13.245 --> 30:14.613
FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE,

30:14.646 --> 30:17.917
OR DO UNTO OTHERS
AS YOU WOULD HAVE THEM...

30:17.950 --> 30:21.520
YOU KNOW THE REST.

30:21.553 --> 30:24.323
SO...
WHICH IS IT?

30:24.356 --> 30:26.458
- IT DEPENDS
ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.060
YOU'RE SAYING
THERE'S NO SUCH THING

30:28.094 --> 30:29.862
AS ABSOLUTE RIGHT OR WRONG,

30:29.896 --> 30:32.198
THAT MORALITY IS MERELY
A MATTER OF CIRCUMSTANCE?

30:32.231 --> 30:34.100
- WHAT THE FUCK
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

30:34.133 --> 30:38.337
- SAY SOMEBODY BASHES YOU,
NEARLY KILLS YOU.

30:38.370 --> 30:41.207
DOES THAT GIVE YOU THE RIGHT
TO GO OUT AND DO THE SAME?

30:41.240 --> 30:43.475
- OF COURSE NOT.
- WHY?

30:43.509 --> 30:45.077
- 'CAUSE TWO WRONGS
DON'T MAKE A RIGHT.

30:45.111 --> 30:46.412
- BESIDES, THERE ARE LAWS.

30:46.445 --> 30:49.081
- BUT WHAT IF THE LAW FAILED
TO PROTECT YOU?

30:49.115 --> 30:51.217
WHAT IF THE LAW DOESN'T
GIVE A SHIT? THEN WHAT?

30:51.250 --> 30:53.019
- THEN I GUESS
YOU'D HAVE TO TAKE THE LAW

30:53.052 --> 30:54.220
INTO YOUR OWN HANDS.
- NO, NO, NO.

30:54.253 --> 30:55.621
VIOLENCE IS NEVER
A MORAL OPTION.

30:55.654 --> 30:57.423
- BUT DOING NOTHING

30:57.456 --> 31:00.492
AND LETTING SOMEONE
BASH YOUR BRAINS IN--IT IS.

31:00.526 --> 31:03.362
[patrons cheering]

31:03.395 --> 31:08.968
THUS, CONSCIENCE DOES MAKE
COWARDS OF US ALL.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.402
- * HEY, HEY, HEY, COME ON

31:10.436 --> 31:14.240
- COME ON, BABE. LET'S DANCE.

31:14.273 --> 31:22.214
*

31:25.184 --> 31:27.253
SO JUST FOR
MY OWN CURIOSITY,

31:27.286 --> 31:30.923
YOU THOUGHT MY BOOK WAS SLOW?

31:30.957 --> 31:32.691
DULL? BORING?
- WHAT?

31:32.724 --> 31:33.993
I NEVER SAID THAT.

31:34.026 --> 31:37.563
- JUST FOR MY OWN CURIOSITY.

31:37.596 --> 31:39.398
- CERTAIN PARTS...

31:39.431 --> 31:42.034
FELT A LITTLE LONG,
THAT'S ALL.

31:42.068 --> 31:43.035
- WHICH PARTS?

31:43.069 --> 31:45.071
- I CAN'T REMEMBER.

31:45.104 --> 31:48.407
- OH-HO-HO, TRY.

31:48.440 --> 31:51.143
- IT WAS JUST AN OVERALL
FEELING.

31:51.177 --> 31:53.545
- OVERALL PLOT?

31:53.579 --> 31:56.148
CHARACTERS? THEME? WHAT?

31:56.182 --> 31:58.584
- I DON'T KNOW.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.953
- I GUESS SOMETIMES
I DIDN'T KNOW

32:00.987 --> 32:04.290
WHERE THE STORY WAS GOING.
- UH-HUH.

32:04.323 --> 32:09.561
- AND I WASN'T QUITE SURE
WHAT THE MAIN CHARACTER WANTED.

32:09.595 --> 32:12.564
- UH-HUH.
- OR HOW IT WAS, UH,

32:12.598 --> 32:15.167
ALL SUPPOSED TO ADD UP.

32:15.201 --> 32:17.703
- MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE TIME
OR PLACE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

32:17.736 --> 32:19.205
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
BROUGHT IT UP.

32:19.238 --> 32:20.372
IN FACT, I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
ASKED YOU

32:20.406 --> 32:21.373
TO READ IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

32:21.407 --> 32:23.175
- WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

32:23.209 --> 32:24.176
- LET'S FACE IT,
YOU DON'T EXACTLY HAVE

32:24.210 --> 32:25.311
A LITERARY BACKGROUND.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.079
- EXCUSE ME IF I DIDN'T GO

32:27.113 --> 32:29.048
TO HARVARD OR YALE.
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT

32:29.081 --> 32:32.118
THAT YOU'RE MORE JUSTICE LEAGUE
THAN IVY LEAGUE.

32:32.151 --> 32:34.486
*

32:34.520 --> 32:38.057
[both grunting]

32:38.090 --> 32:39.725
*

32:39.758 --> 32:43.662
[cheers and applause]

32:50.102 --> 32:51.370
- ARE YOU GOING IN TO WORK
TODAY?

32:51.403 --> 32:53.339
- WHAT FOR?
MAIL COME?

32:53.372 --> 32:56.108
- I HAVEN'T CHECKED YET.

32:56.142 --> 32:57.543
- OH. UH, HI.

32:57.576 --> 33:02.781
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO PUT THIS
UNDER YOUR DOOR.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.351
- COME ON.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.119
[door shuts]

33:09.821 --> 33:11.523
- AT LEAST WHEN WERTSHAFTER
FIRED ME,

33:11.557 --> 33:12.758
I HAD THE COMFORT OF KNOWING

33:12.791 --> 33:14.226
THAT HE WAS A BIGOTED
STRAIGHT MAN

33:14.260 --> 33:15.627
WITH AN ENLARGED PROSTATE.

33:15.661 --> 33:18.230
BUT IN YOUR CASE, UGH...

33:18.264 --> 33:21.367
TO BE DUMPED BY TWO
FELLOW LESBIANS.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.403
THE SENSE OF BETRAYAL
MUST BE CRUSHING,

33:24.436 --> 33:27.173
STAGGERING, ALL-CONSUMING.

33:27.206 --> 33:28.707
- THANKS.
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER NOW.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.509
- [chuckles]

33:30.542 --> 33:33.812
OH, HERE.
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THIS.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.648
IT'S FOR YOU AND LINZ.

33:36.682 --> 33:40.052
I'M MAKING MY AMENDS.

33:40.086 --> 33:42.388
I'VE WRITTEN THEM TO EVERYONE.

33:42.421 --> 33:46.192
EVERYONE, THAT IS, EXCEPT
EMMETT. I JUST...

33:46.225 --> 33:48.160
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY,

33:48.194 --> 33:53.532
EXCEPT THAT I WISH I COULD
CHANGE EVERYTHING.

33:53.565 --> 33:56.268
- I'LL GIVE THIS TO LINZ.

33:56.302 --> 33:59.171
I KNOW SHE'LL BE AS PROUD OF YOU
AS I AM.

34:04.576 --> 34:08.547
- THANKS, MEL.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.549
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?
- HMM?

34:10.582 --> 34:12.484
- WHEN I WAS GROWING UP,

34:12.518 --> 34:14.820
MY FATHER HAD
THE SERENITY PRAYER

34:14.853 --> 34:16.422
TAPED TO THE REFRIGERATOR.

34:16.455 --> 34:18.557
HE WASN'T IN A.A.
NEVER TOUCHED A DROP.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.292
HE JUST LIKED IT.

34:20.326 --> 34:22.828
I SAW IT TEN TIMES A DAY.

34:22.861 --> 34:25.697
KNEW IT BY HEART, OF COURSE.

34:25.731 --> 34:29.301
NEVER MEANT ANYTHING.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.570
NOW...
[scoffs]

34:31.603 --> 34:34.740
IT'S BEEN MY SALVATION.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.575
"GOD GRANT ME THE SERENITY

34:36.608 --> 34:39.478
"TO ACCEPT THE THINGS
I CANNOT CHANGE...

34:39.511 --> 34:43.349
"THE COURAGE TO CHANGE
THE THINGS I CAN...

34:43.382 --> 34:47.519
AND THE WISDOM
TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE."

34:53.492 --> 34:55.227
- EXCUSE ME A SECOND.

34:55.261 --> 34:58.197
THE NEW LAYOUTS FOR PARCHEESY
PIZZA ARE ON YOUR DESK,

34:58.230 --> 35:01.200
AND LEO BROWN IS
EXPECTING YOUR CALL.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.402
OH, AND THERE'S A YOUNG WOMAN
WHO SAYS SHE KNOWS YOU.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.271
NEEDS TO TALK TO YOU
RIGHT AWAY.

35:08.374 --> 35:11.343
- WHY, DAPHNE, WHAT AN
UNEXPECTED SURPRISE.

35:11.377 --> 35:14.146
YOU LOOK PARTICULARLY
ENCHANTING TODAY.

35:14.180 --> 35:17.249
- MIND IF YOU HIT ON ME LATER?

35:17.283 --> 35:21.820
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.

35:21.853 --> 35:26.658
- * JUST HOW LONG
WILL THESE DAYS TAKE *

35:26.692 --> 35:30.362
* WAITING FOR AN EARTHQUAKE?

35:30.396 --> 35:33.265
* SEEMS ONE ALREADY CA-A-AME

35:33.299 --> 35:36.902
- I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.
- THANKS FOR THE HEADS-UP.

35:36.935 --> 35:38.504
BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH
I CAN DO.

35:38.537 --> 35:39.805
- CAN'T YOU TALK TO HIM?

35:39.838 --> 35:43.375
- BEEN THERE, TRIED THAT.

35:43.409 --> 35:45.411
HASN'T DONE MUCH GOOD.

35:45.444 --> 35:48.514
- WHAT IF HE GETS INTO A FIGHT?

35:48.547 --> 35:51.450
WHAT IF HE GETS HURT?

35:53.619 --> 35:55.687
- THEN AT LEAST HE'LL KNOW
HE STOOD UP...

35:55.721 --> 35:58.390
AND FOUGHT BACK--
THAT HE DIDN'T RUN AWAY.

35:58.424 --> 36:02.728
- * WE BUILD THINGS PRETTY,
DEAR *

36:02.761 --> 36:06.265
* THE OLD GO DOWN
IN FLA-A-AMES *

36:06.298 --> 36:09.835
*

36:09.868 --> 36:12.438
- I WANT TO GO OVER A FEW
OF THE POINTS I'LL BE MAKING

36:12.471 --> 36:15.274
IN MY, UH, OPENING ARGUMENT.
NOW...

36:15.307 --> 36:18.277
- EXCUSE ME, LARRY.
I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.712
JEANETTE, ANNA, I JUST
STOPPED IN TO SAY THAT

36:20.746 --> 36:24.550
I UNDERSTAND YOUR DECISION,
THAT I DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY,

36:24.583 --> 36:27.619
AND THAT I'M WILLING TO OFFER
MY ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT.

36:27.653 --> 36:29.688
CONSIDERING THE IMPORTANCE
OF THIS CASE,

36:29.721 --> 36:32.324
IT WOULD BE REMISS OF ME
NOT TO.

36:36.262 --> 36:40.599
- UH, MEL?

36:40.632 --> 36:43.235
WE COULD USE YOUR ASSISTANCE
AND SUPPORT.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.510
[dramatic guitar music]

36:51.543 --> 36:57.649
*

36:57.683 --> 37:00.419
[knock on door]

37:03.422 --> 37:05.724
- SPEND LESS TIME GETTING THERE

37:05.757 --> 37:07.993
AND MORE TIME BEING THERE.

37:08.026 --> 37:11.029
THE ISLANDS OF THE BAHAMAS...

37:11.062 --> 37:13.799
- HEY, DEB.
- EM, HONEY.

37:13.832 --> 37:15.401
- I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
MY DROPPING BY.

37:15.434 --> 37:16.868
I SAW YOUR LIGHT WAS ON.
- OH, NO.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.504
I'M GLAD YOU DID.
COME ON IN.

37:18.537 --> 37:21.607
- WELL, JUST FOR A MINUTE.
- HI.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.009
- SO, UH, HOW'D VIC LIKE HIS
HOUSEWARMING GIFT?

37:24.042 --> 37:27.379
- WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
HE WASN'T EXPECTING IT.

37:27.413 --> 37:29.381
YOU WANT SOME ICE CREAM?

37:29.415 --> 37:32.017
- MY GOD, IT'S LIKE
A SODA FOUNTAIN IN HERE.

37:32.050 --> 37:34.019
- ALL THAT'S MISSING IS
THE WHIPPED CREAM.

37:34.052 --> 37:37.889
- OH, WAIT.

37:37.923 --> 37:42.361
- [laughs]

37:42.394 --> 37:44.663
- SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WANDERING AROUND

37:44.696 --> 37:46.765
INSTEAD OF SPENDING A NICE,
QUIET EVENING AT HOME

37:46.798 --> 37:48.667
FUCKING YOUR BRAINS OUT?

37:48.700 --> 37:53.038
- THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH FUCKING
YOUR BRAINS OUT ONE CAN DO.

37:53.071 --> 37:55.807
- YOU HAVE A TEMPERATURE,
HONEY?

37:55.841 --> 37:58.076
- YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST NICE TO
HAVE SOMEONE TO TALK TO,

37:58.109 --> 37:59.778
THAT'S ALL.
- YEAH.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.447
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.415
- IN FACT, WALKING OVER HERE,
I WAS THINKING, UH,

38:03.449 --> 38:05.651
ABOUT WHEN MICHAEL AND I
SHARED THE APARTMENT.

38:05.684 --> 38:06.785
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE BEST TIMES WERE?

38:06.818 --> 38:09.521
UH, JUST SITTING ON THE SOFA

38:09.555 --> 38:12.924
AFTER ONE OF US HAD GIVEN
SOME TRICK THE BOOT,

38:12.958 --> 38:16.662
EATING CHIPS OR ICE CREAM,

38:16.695 --> 38:20.466
GABBING TILL ALL HOURS.

38:20.499 --> 38:27.806
SOMETIMES WE'D FALL ASLEEP WITH
OUR HEADS IN EACH OTHER'S LAPS.

38:27.839 --> 38:30.942
- WELL, WHAT GOOD'S AN ICE CREAM
SUNDAE WITHOUT TWO SPOONS?

38:30.976 --> 38:33.945
- HMMM.
UH, WHAT KIND IS THAT?

38:33.979 --> 38:35.881
- MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.048
- DON'T MIND IF I DO.

38:41.787 --> 38:44.089
WHAT YOU WATCHING?
- HMM.

38:44.122 --> 38:46.124
THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL
IS ABOUT TO START.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.726
- OH, MY GOD.

38:47.759 --> 38:49.695
THAT'S MY ALL-TIME FAVE.

38:49.728 --> 38:52.431
- WOW!
ALL RIGHT.

38:52.464 --> 38:54.966
[both chuckling]

38:55.000 --> 38:57.836
SO, HOW WAS YOUR LAST TRICK?

38:57.869 --> 38:59.971
- MMM, BIG DICK.
TEENY BRAIN.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.507
- THE BEST KIND.

39:01.540 --> 39:03.041
- COMING UP, CHANNEL SEVEN
IN PITTSBURGH

39:03.074 --> 39:05.444
IS PLEASED TO PRESENT
THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL,

39:05.477 --> 39:07.846
STARRING LANA TURNER
AND KIRK DOUGLAS.

39:07.879 --> 39:09.981
- I PICKED UP SOME CHICKEN.

39:10.015 --> 39:13.118
EXTRA VEGGIES, NO POTATOES.
YOU HUNGRY?

39:13.151 --> 39:18.490
- MAYBE LATER.

39:18.524 --> 39:20.626
- YOU WORKING ON YOUR BOOK?

39:20.659 --> 39:24.062
- RE-READING THE BORING PARTS.

39:27.633 --> 39:28.900
- I THOUGHT THIS WAS BORING TOO,

39:28.934 --> 39:32.037
AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
A CLASSIC.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.605
LET'S FACE IT,
IF I KNEW THE DIFFERENCE

39:33.639 --> 39:35.173
BETWEEN A GREAT BOOK
AND A LOUSY ONE,

39:35.206 --> 39:37.543
I WOULD'VE GONE TO HARVARD
OR YALE

39:37.576 --> 39:39.478
INSTEAD OF GOING
TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE

39:39.511 --> 39:40.779
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

39:40.812 --> 39:43.014
- I HEARD FROM MY PUBLISHER.
- YOU DID?

39:43.048 --> 39:45.617
- THEY HAD A FEW COMMENTS
OF THEIR OWN.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.653
- SEE, THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED,

39:47.686 --> 39:49.621
A PROFESSIONAL OPINION
FROM PEOPLE

39:49.655 --> 39:51.623
WHO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

39:51.657 --> 39:56.928
- THEY FELT THE MAIN CHARACTER'S
MOTIVATION WAS UNCLEAR,

39:56.962 --> 40:00.566
THAT THE STORY WAS
OVERLY COMPLEX

40:00.599 --> 40:02.100
AND CONVOLUTED,

40:02.133 --> 40:07.806
AND THAT, THEMATICALLY,
IT LACKED FORCE AND FOCUS.

40:07.839 --> 40:13.479
SO, IN OTHER WORDS,
EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID.

40:15.146 --> 40:18.850
SO THEY PASSED.

40:18.884 --> 40:21.820
- I'M SORRY, BEN.

40:21.853 --> 40:26.958
- FOR WHAT, BEING HONEST?

40:42.240 --> 40:44.676
[car alarm chirps]

40:44.710 --> 40:47.979
- CHRIST. TAYLOR?

40:48.013 --> 40:49.981
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

40:50.015 --> 40:51.817
STALKING ME?

40:51.850 --> 40:54.686
FUCKING CREEPS, GET OUT OF HERE
OR I'LL CALL THE POLICE.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.454
- NOT UNTIL HE GETS
WHAT HE CAME FOR.

40:58.123 --> 41:01.493
- WHAT'S THAT?
YOU WANT TO SUCK MY COCK?

41:01.527 --> 41:03.695
- I WANT YOU TO APOLOGIZE.

41:03.729 --> 41:07.733
- FOR WHAT?
- FOR BASHING ME...

41:07.766 --> 41:10.702
FOR CAUSING ME BRAIN DAMAGE
AND PERMANENT INJURY,

41:10.736 --> 41:14.239
FOR GIVING ME NIGHTMARES
EVERY NIGHT FOR TWO YEARS,

41:14.272 --> 41:18.610
FOR FILLING ME WITH FEAR
EVERY TIME I WALK OUT THE DOOR,

41:18.644 --> 41:22.981
FOR TREATING ME LIKE A SUBHUMAN
WHO DOESN'T DESERVE TO LIVE.

41:23.014 --> 41:25.784
- THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE, TAYLOR.

41:28.086 --> 41:30.021
NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'D LIKE TO KICK BACK

41:30.055 --> 41:31.623
AND HAVE A BEER.

41:31.657 --> 41:34.726
- TELL HIM YOU'RE SORRY.

41:34.760 --> 41:38.897
- GET OUT OF MY WAY, FAGGOTS.

41:55.213 --> 41:58.216
- DON'T FUCK WITH ME!

42:01.720 --> 42:05.156
- COME ON, MAN,
JUST TAKE IT EASY.

42:05.190 --> 42:06.758
- GET ON YOUR KNEES.

42:06.792 --> 42:09.561
- WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU--
- DO WHAT HE SAYS!

42:09.595 --> 42:13.765
- I SAID GET ON YOUR KNEES!

42:13.799 --> 42:15.934
- OKAY, OKAY.

42:25.944 --> 42:29.848
- THERE.
YOU SCARED ME, SEE?

42:29.881 --> 42:32.283
NOW PUT THE GUN AWAY.

42:39.958 --> 42:43.929
- FIRST SAY, "I'M SORRY."

42:43.962 --> 42:45.563
SAY IT.

42:47.866 --> 42:50.001
- I'M SORRY.

42:50.035 --> 42:51.737
- "FOR BASHING YOU."

42:51.770 --> 42:55.807
- [voice shaking]
FOR BASHING YOU.

42:55.841 --> 42:59.878
- "FOR CAUSING YOU BRAIN DAMAGE
AND PERMANENT INJURY."

42:59.911 --> 43:05.116
- FOR CAUSING YOU BRAIN DAMAGE
AND PERMANENT INJURY.

43:14.125 --> 43:16.294
- NOW SUCK ON THIS.

43:16.327 --> 43:17.763
- THAT'S IT. FUCK, YEAH!

43:20.431 --> 43:23.835
- GO ON, SUCK IT.

43:23.869 --> 43:26.137
- PLEASE...

43:26.171 --> 43:28.606
- SUCK IT!

43:32.410 --> 43:34.312
- THIS IS BEAUTIFUL, MAN.

43:34.345 --> 43:36.114
THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
WANTING TO DO

43:36.147 --> 43:38.249
ALL THIS TIME.

43:38.283 --> 43:41.252
- NOW YOU KNOW
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE--

43:41.286 --> 43:47.993
THE FEAR THAT ALL FAGGOTS FEEL
ALL THEIR LIVES...

43:48.026 --> 43:49.928
- [sobbing]

43:49.961 --> 43:54.866
- WALKING DOWN THE STREET,
HOLDING HANDS...

43:54.900 --> 43:59.170
BECAUSE OF ASSHOLES LIKE YOU!

43:59.204 --> 44:02.741
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

44:05.844 --> 44:08.079
WE'RE TIRED OF IT.

44:10.081 --> 44:11.717
- DO IT.

44:19.324 --> 44:22.060
DO IT!

44:32.070 --> 44:34.339
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?
YOU CAN'T STOP NOW.

44:34.372 --> 44:38.043
- GET UP.

44:38.076 --> 44:40.178
GET UP.

44:40.211 --> 44:41.880
GO INSIDE.

44:45.016 --> 44:47.085
- YOU CAN'T LET HIM GO.

44:47.118 --> 44:49.187
- AND I WOULDN'T CALL
THE POLICE.

44:49.220 --> 44:50.488
YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE
TO TELL THEM

44:50.521 --> 44:52.958
A COUPLE FAGGOTS MADE YOU
SHIT YOUR PANTS.

44:52.991 --> 44:56.728
- YOU COWARD.
YOU FUCKING COWARD!

44:56.762 --> 44:58.096
YOU LET HIM GET AWAY.

44:58.129 --> 44:59.931
YOU HAD HIM!

44:59.965 --> 45:02.801
YOU COULD'VE HAD HIM,
BUT YOU WERE TOO CHICKENSHIT.

45:02.834 --> 45:04.870
YOU'RE LIKE
ALL THE OTHER FAGGOTS.

45:04.903 --> 45:06.805
YOU'RE TOO AFRAID.

45:06.838 --> 45:10.942
YOU'RE ALL COWARDS,
AND THEY KNOW IT.

45:10.976 --> 45:14.379
YOU COULD'VE ENDED IT!

45:14.412 --> 45:15.981
FAGGOT!

45:16.014 --> 45:18.383
YOU ARE NO DIFFERENT
THAN THE REST OF THEM.

45:18.416 --> 45:22.020
YOU DESERVE WHAT YOU GET.
[frustrated groan]

45:22.053 --> 45:24.990
- [sighs]
- AND YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?

45:25.023 --> 45:28.359
BECAUSE YOU'RE ALL FUCKING
PUSSIES, THAT'S WHY.

45:28.393 --> 45:32.497
UNTIL WE SHOW THOSE HETERO
ASSHOLES THAT WE HAVE BALLS,

45:32.530 --> 45:34.833
THAT WE CAN PULL THE TRIGGER,

45:34.866 --> 45:37.769
BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF THEM
THE WAY THAT THEY DO US,

45:37.803 --> 45:42.540
THEY'LL ALWAYS THINK WE'RE
FUCKING PUSSIES!
