WEBVTT

00:04.872 --> 00:06.006
WHAT DID YOU DO,
HIDE THE FLASHLIGHTS?

00:06.040 --> 00:08.342
I HAD TO. THE KIDS
WERE SCREWIN' AROUND
WITH THEM SO MUCH,

00:08.376 --> 00:10.544
I WAS AFRAID
THE BATTERIES
WOULD BE DEAD

00:10.578 --> 00:11.779
IN CASE
OF AN EMERGENCY.

00:11.812 --> 00:12.880
THAT WAS
SOME SMART THINKING.

00:12.913 --> 00:15.683
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T DO THAT
WITH THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

00:15.716 --> 00:16.317
NO.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.187
NO. I JUST
THREW THAT OUT.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.655
HEY, DAD? I DIDN'T
FIND A FLASHLIGHT,

00:21.689 --> 00:24.358
BUT I FOUND MR. BONES.
HE GLOWS!

00:24.392 --> 00:27.795
IT'S A BLACKOUT, DUFUS.
WE NEED REAL LIGHT.

00:27.828 --> 00:28.729
FINE. KEEP LOOKING.

00:28.762 --> 00:32.733
IN AN HOUR, YOU'LL BE
BEGGING FOR MR. BONES.

00:33.201 --> 00:35.069
DID I MISS THE KICKOFF?

00:35.103 --> 00:36.036
NO, BUT YOU WILL.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.472
THE TV's NOT EVEN ON.
IT'S SUPER BOWL SUNDAY!

00:38.506 --> 00:40.007
DAD, WILL YOU
LOOK AROUND YOU?
THE POWER'S OUT.

00:40.040 --> 00:45.613
OH, YEAH. MY SON SEAN
IF-IT'S-NOT-A-RED-ENVELOPE-
I'M-NOT-PAYING-IT FINNERTY.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.149
NO. NO, DAD.
JUICE IS OUT
ON THE WHOLE BLOCK.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.251
WELL, THAT'S WEIRD.
THERE WASN'T A STORM
OR ANYTHING.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.120
WELL, MAYBE EVERYBODY'S
WATCHIN' THE SUPER BOWL

00:52.153 --> 00:54.155
AND IT OVERLOADED
THE POWER GRID.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.456
BUT THE GAME
HASN'T EVEN STARTED YET.

00:55.489 --> 00:56.824
MAYBE THEY'RE WATCHIN'
THE PRE-GAME.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.859
NOBODY WATCHES
THE PRE-GAME.

00:58.892 --> 00:59.860
OK! DAD, LOOK.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.061
BAD THINGS HAPPEN
IN LIFE, OK?

01:01.095 --> 01:03.531
WE MUDDLE THROUGH
BEST WE CAN, EVEN
ON SUPER BOWL SUNDAY.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.400
NOW, IT'S DARK, I
GOTTA FIND A FLASHLIGHT
TO PROTECT MY FAMILY,

01:06.434 --> 01:09.170
AND I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO PLAY 20 QUESTIONS
WITH YOU.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.204
FINE.
GOOD.

01:10.238 --> 01:10.938
SO WHY ARE
YOU LIMPING?

01:10.971 --> 01:12.806
UH, 'CAUSE
I CAUSED THE BLACKOUT.

01:12.840 --> 01:13.874
AH!

01:13.907 --> 01:15.743
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME NOW,
I HAVE TO GO TO THE BASEMENT

01:15.776 --> 01:18.112
WHERE I THINK
I LEFT THE FLASHLIGHTS.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.113
HENRY?

01:19.147 --> 01:19.747
YEAH?

01:19.780 --> 01:22.350
I NEED MR. BONES.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.830
FIRST RULE
OF A BLACKOUT, JIMMY.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.300
EAT ALL THE FROZEN STUFF
BEFORE IT SPOILS.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.701
GREAT. START
WITH THE ICE CREAM?

01:40.734 --> 01:43.437
NO. WE'RE STARTING
WITH THE MEAT LOAF.

01:43.471 --> 01:44.205
OH, GREAT.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.474
OH, I GOT IT,
I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.276
2 REGULAR
FLASHLIGHTS,

01:48.309 --> 01:50.844
AND, UH, ONE OF
THESE SPINNY THINGS.

01:50.878 --> 01:51.579
WOW.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.382
LET ME SEE WHAT I GOT
IN MY CAR.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.617
SO, UH, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING WITH
THE MEAT LOAF?

01:56.650 --> 01:59.387
IN A CRISIS,
YOU IMPROVISE.

01:59.420 --> 02:03.424
I GIVE YOU
THE MEAT TORCH.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.527
HENRY!

02:06.560 --> 02:08.396
SORRY! IT'S A REFLEX.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.298
O'Keefe: FINNERTY! FINNERTY!

02:10.331 --> 02:11.699
OH, GOD. WHAT NOW?

02:11.732 --> 02:12.733
FINNERTY! FINNERTY!

02:12.766 --> 02:13.534
YEAH.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.502
YOU GOT ANY BATTERIES
I CAN BORROW?

02:14.535 --> 02:17.305
HEY, COME ON. WE GOT
A BLACKOUT OVER HERE, TOO.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.472
WELL, THAT'S NOT
MY PROBLEM.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.208
I GOT A HOUSE
FULL OF GUESTS.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.342
SUPER BOWL PARTY.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.244
I WAS GONNA
INVITE YOU,

02:23.277 --> 02:24.212
BUT I DIDN'T.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.279
OH, THANKS ANYWAY.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.614
WELL, WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED?

02:26.647 --> 02:28.716
I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW?
I CALLED THE CON ED GUY
OVER AN HOUR AGO.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.651
I'M SURE THE POWER'S
GONNA BE ON PRETTY SOON.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.286
I HOPE SO. THE HAM'S
GETTIN' COLD,

02:32.320 --> 02:33.487
AND THE BEER'S
GETTIN' WARM.

02:33.521 --> 02:36.724
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TRY
WRAPPIN' THE HAM
AROUND YOUR BEER?

02:38.626 --> 02:40.228
THAT MIGHT WORK.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.863
GOOD NEWS. I FOUND
SOME CANDLES IN THE BATHROOM.

02:42.896 --> 02:43.897
THEY'RE SCENTED.

02:43.931 --> 02:44.898
WHICH SCENTS?

02:44.932 --> 02:46.534
HMM. VANILLA,

02:46.567 --> 02:47.735
POMEGRANATE,

02:47.768 --> 02:48.669
AND...

02:48.702 --> 02:49.703
I DON'T KNOW. SALMON?

02:49.737 --> 02:51.405
OH, OK.

02:51.439 --> 02:55.243
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS KEEP EMERGENCY
LIGHTS IN YOUR CAR.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.311
PLUS A BLANKET,
POTABLE WATER,

02:57.345 --> 02:59.647
FIRST-AID KIT,
CANNED FOOD, FLARES--

02:59.680 --> 03:02.416
I KNOW, DAD. YOU TELL ME
ALL THE TIME.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.150
UH-HUH.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.485
AND WHAT DO YOU HAVE
IN YOUR CAR?

03:04.518 --> 03:07.755
HALF A ROLL OF CERTS
AND A MAP OF DELAWARE.

03:08.422 --> 03:09.490
LET ME ASK YOU THIS:

03:09.523 --> 03:11.792
HOW DOES ONE MAN
CAUSE A BLACKOUT?

03:11.825 --> 03:14.995
OK, YOU KNOW THAT,
UH, OVERGROWN OAK TREE
OUT FRONT?

03:15.028 --> 03:16.129
WELL, THE WIND WAS
BLOWIN' ALL LAST WEEK,

03:16.163 --> 03:18.866
AND IT WAS
KNOCKIN' THE BRANCHES
INTO THE HOUSE, AND...

03:18.899 --> 03:20.734
HENRY WAS HAVIN'
A HARD TIME WITH IT.

03:20.768 --> 03:26.340
[WIND BLOWING,
BRANCHES SCRAPING, THUMPING]

03:32.746 --> 03:36.484
Deep Voice: LET ME OUT!

03:36.517 --> 03:37.651
NO! YOU'RE DEAD!

03:37.685 --> 03:39.387
I'M UNDEAD.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.754
WELL, THAT'S EVEN WORSE!

03:40.788 --> 03:41.755
COME ON, HENRY.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.725
I'D LET YOU
OUT OF YOUR COFFIN.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.794
I'M NOT IN A COFFIN!

03:46.827 --> 03:47.728
YOU WILL BE.

03:47.761 --> 03:51.732
OK. NOW, I'M DEFINITELY
NOT LETTING YOU OUT.

03:51.765 --> 03:52.633
DAMN IT.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.001
IT WAS A JOKE.

03:54.034 --> 03:54.768
NO, IT WASN'T!

03:54.802 --> 03:56.970
YOU KNOW WHAT,
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.740
AAH! AAH!

04:00.508 --> 04:01.208
OW!

04:01.241 --> 04:04.812
OK. NOW YOU'RE
REALLY IN TROUBLE!

04:04.845 --> 04:06.280
MOM!

04:06.314 --> 04:07.281
OK, OK!

04:07.315 --> 04:09.283
SWEETIE, SWEETIE. YOU'RE
AWAKE, YOU'RE AWAKE, OK?

04:09.317 --> 04:10.884
WAS IT THE COFFIN
DREAM, HENRY?

04:10.918 --> 04:11.952
YES.
OK, HENRY.

04:11.985 --> 04:14.488
I PROMISE YOU, IF WE EVER
PUT A COFFIN IN YOUR ROOM,

04:14.522 --> 04:16.790
WE'LL PUT A LID ON IT
REALLY, REALLY STRONG

04:16.824 --> 04:19.360
SO NO ZOMBIE
COULD EVER GET OUT.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.329
IS THAT THE BEST
YOU GOT?

04:21.362 --> 04:23.831
YES. I'M HALF ASLEEP
HERE, ALL RIGHT?

04:23.864 --> 04:26.400
YOU KNOW, I HAD
A NIGHTMARE, TOO.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.535
WHAT WAS IT,
JIMMY?

04:27.568 --> 04:28.836
WELL, I DREAMT

04:28.869 --> 04:30.671
THAT MY BROTHER
WAS A LITTLE BABY

04:30.704 --> 04:34.875
WHOSE SCREAMING WOKE ME UP
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.777
WAIT A SECOND.
THAT WASN'T A DREAM.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.812
THAT'S MY REALITY!

04:38.846 --> 04:40.548
YOU SHUT UP, JIMMY!

04:40.581 --> 04:41.449
ALL RIGHT.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.282
THAT'S ENOUGH. THAT'S IT.
REALLY. HONEST.

04:42.316 --> 04:44.952
TOMORROW. YOU GOTTA
CALL THE TREE GUY.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.454
OK. OK.

04:46.487 --> 04:49.089
THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE.
THAT LITTLE BRANCH.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.624
SURE. I CAN
TAKE CARE OF IT.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.092
IT'S GONNA RUN YOU
ABOUT $500.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.895
500 BUCKS? COME ON,
FOR 3 MINUTES OF SAWING?

04:54.928 --> 04:55.863
IT JUST--IT'S
JUST A BRANCH!

04:55.896 --> 04:57.598
WELL, I GOTTA GET
A CHERRY PICKER
OVER HERE,

04:57.631 --> 04:59.900
SECURE A FALL LINE,
HIRE A MAN
TO GET UP THERE--

04:59.933 --> 05:01.902
OK, OK. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GOT IT MYSELF.

05:01.935 --> 05:05.105
SIR, FOR SOMETHING
LIKE THIS, YOU NEED
A TREE SURGEON.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.974
YES, SEAN. YOU'RE
NOT A TREE SURGEON.

05:07.007 --> 05:11.845
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M NO QUALIFIED
TREE SURGEON.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.747
SO YOU'LL
LET ME KNOW?

05:13.781 --> 05:18.118
ALTHOUGH I DID ATTEND
TREE SURGEON UNIVERSITY
MEDICAL SCHOOL INTERNATIONAL

05:18.151 --> 05:22.656
AND I WORKED WITH
A PARTICULAR TREE SURGEON
ANESTHESIOLOGIST--

05:22.690 --> 05:23.557
OH, NURSE!

05:23.591 --> 05:25.659
LOOK, A WOODPECKER
HAS ATTACKED THIS TREE!

05:25.693 --> 05:27.628
IT'S--CLEAR THE O.R.!

05:27.661 --> 05:29.963
I NEED 6 LITERS
OF SAP, STAT!

05:29.997 --> 05:31.732
COME ON! COME ON!

05:31.765 --> 05:33.467
I DON'T WANNA
LOSE YOU! NO!

05:33.501 --> 05:35.703
NO! NOT ON MY WATCH!

05:36.437 --> 05:37.405
COME ON, BABY!

05:37.438 --> 05:39.573
EPINEPHRINE NOW!

05:40.073 --> 05:41.709
OH, YES!

05:41.742 --> 05:43.043
I THINK WE GOT HIM BACK!

05:43.076 --> 05:45.679
WE HAVE A PULSE!

05:45.713 --> 05:47.014
CLAUDIA?

05:47.648 --> 05:48.716
DON'T TELL ME.

05:48.749 --> 05:49.817
YOU WENT IN THE TREE.

05:49.850 --> 05:50.918
YEAH, DAD.
I WENT IN THE TREE.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.786
YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE THE TOOLS.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.955
HEY, I GOT SOME TOOLS.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.659
SEAN, I'M GOING
TO THE STORE.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.828
BE CAREFUL UP THERE.

06:00.861 --> 06:01.995
WHAT?

06:02.029 --> 06:03.664
I SAID BE CAREFUL.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.833
OH, YEAH. THAT'S
THE ONE THING I FORGOT--

06:05.866 --> 06:08.636
TO BE CAREFUL WITH THE SAW
30 FEET UP IN THE AIR.

06:08.669 --> 06:09.937
THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.739
YOU'RE WELCOME. IF
YOU GO TO THE HOSPITAL,

06:11.772 --> 06:14.074
DON'T FORGET
TO BRING YOUR ARM.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.822
LILY?

06:28.856 --> 06:30.891
AAH!

06:35.796 --> 06:36.564
OH, MY GOD.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.165
LILY IS SMOKIN'
THE HIPPIE LETTUCE?

06:38.198 --> 06:39.099
OH, COME ON, DAD.

06:39.132 --> 06:42.202
TAKE IT EASY, ALL RIGHT?
IT'S TAKEN CARE OF.

06:46.006 --> 06:50.744
FINNERTY. MY GUESTS AND I
WERE JUST OUT FRONT
TALKIN' TO THE CON ED GUY,

06:50.778 --> 06:53.146
AND HE THINKS
HE FOUND THE PROBLEM.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.314
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.817
YEAH. HE THINKS
IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

06:56.850 --> 06:57.918
OH. WELL,

06:57.951 --> 07:00.087
I THINK
WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT
THAT'S THE WRONG TOOL

07:00.120 --> 07:00.921
FOR THE JOB.

07:00.954 --> 07:04.792
YEAH. WHAT WAS
"S. FINNERTY" THINKIN'?

07:04.825 --> 07:06.059
OK.

07:06.093 --> 07:06.760
OK, LOOK.

07:06.794 --> 07:07.995
I MIGHT HAVE
ACCIDENTALLY, UH--

07:08.028 --> 07:09.663
YOU'VE SAID
ENOUGH, SEAN.

07:09.697 --> 07:10.598
LET ME HANDLE THIS.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.033
GUYS, MY BROTHER
DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.602
YOU'RE GUESTS
IN HIS HOUSE.

07:14.635 --> 07:15.736
HEY, IT'S OK,
ED, I--

07:15.769 --> 07:19.006
NO, IT AIN'T OK. YOU
DON'T OWE ANYBODY
AN EXPLANATION.

07:22.042 --> 07:22.843
EXCEPT
MAYBE THIS GUY.

07:22.876 --> 07:26.113
OK. LOOK, GUYS.
I'M SORRY, ALL RIGHT?

07:26.146 --> 07:27.180
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
BUT, COME ON,

07:27.214 --> 07:29.116
IT'S JUST--IT'S
JUST A FOOTBALL GAME.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.518
IT'S JUST
A FOOTBALL GAME?

07:30.551 --> 07:31.552
IT'S THE SUPER BOWL.

07:31.585 --> 07:34.622
YEAH. WELL, COME ON.
THE SUPER BOWL'S
ALWAYS DULL.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.092
OH, MY GOD.
IS THAT A TV?

07:39.126 --> 07:39.760
IS THE GAME ON?

07:39.793 --> 07:41.094
I THINK
THAT'S KURT WARNER.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.730
NO. THAT'S
MARSHALL FAULK.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.998
I THINK
IT'S AN EYELASH.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.734
HELL
OF A SUPER BOWL
PARTY, SEAN.

07:46.767 --> 07:52.005
I'M GONNA GO FIND LILY
AND SEE IF I CAN
CATCH A BUZZ.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.206
OH!

07:53.240 --> 07:54.942
SEAN, I AM SO SORRY!

07:54.975 --> 07:57.645
I REALLY OWE YOU AN APOLOGY
ABOUT WHAT I SAID BEFORE.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.113
I REALLY SHOULDN'T NAG YOU
ABOUT BEING CAREFUL.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.214
CLAUDIA, I--
NO, NO, NO, NO!

08:01.248 --> 08:02.215
IT WAS REALLY BOTHERING ME

08:02.249 --> 08:05.018
WHILE I WAS AT THE STORE
AND WALKING HOME AND...

08:05.052 --> 08:08.956
STEPPING OVER
THAT BROKEN TREE LIMB
AND THE SPARKING POWER LINES.

08:08.989 --> 08:12.092
OK, OK, CLAUDIA.
I COULD BE MORE CAREFUL.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.594
YOU THINK?

08:13.627 --> 08:14.728
YEAH, ACTUALLY...

08:14.762 --> 08:17.998
ACTUALLY, HE'S GOT
A GOOD EXCUSE FOR
BEING DISTRACTED.

08:18.031 --> 08:18.699
SEE, LILY HAD--

08:18.732 --> 08:20.100
DAD, DAD! UH,
UH, UH, UH! OH!

08:20.133 --> 08:21.535
IT'S GOT NOTHIN'
TO DO WITH LILY.

08:21.569 --> 08:22.570
THIS IS ALL ABOUT ME.
LISTEN, BABY,

08:22.603 --> 08:25.539
I'M SORRY
I WAS SO CARELESS.
CAN YOU FORGIVE ME?

08:25.573 --> 08:28.909
NO. I'M GONNA NEED
TO HANG ON TO THIS ONE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

08:28.942 --> 08:33.113
OK? I'LL BE DOWN IN
A LITTLE BIT TO MOCK YOU
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

08:33.146 --> 08:34.114
LOOKIN' FORWARD TO IT.

08:34.147 --> 08:38.018
HERE YOU GO.
THERE'S ABOUT
90 SECONDS ON THAT.

08:39.086 --> 08:39.920
I DON'T GET IT,
SEAN.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.188
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
TELL HER ABOUT LILY?

08:41.221 --> 08:42.255
WELL, IF
I TOLD HER THAT,

08:42.289 --> 08:45.092
THEN I WOULD
HAVE TO TELL HER
ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.127
WHOA. ARE YOU OK?

08:47.160 --> 08:48.161
NO.

08:48.195 --> 08:48.996
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:49.029 --> 08:49.963
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.765
I SAW YOU
WITH THE BAG OF POT!

08:51.799 --> 08:53.634
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE ME.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.636
WELL, IT WAS.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.971
WHERE IS IT?

08:58.005 --> 08:58.872
HUH

08:58.906 --> 09:00.641
DON'T
GO IN THERE!

09:00.674 --> 09:02.943
THAT IS MY
UNDERWEAR DRAWER!

09:02.976 --> 09:04.244
AHA!

09:04.277 --> 09:05.278
HERE IT IS.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.279
THAT'S NOT MINE.

09:06.313 --> 09:06.980
THAT'S NOT YOURS.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.248
IS THAT THE BEST
YOU COULD DO?

09:08.281 --> 09:10.150
IT'S THE TRUTH.
IT'S NOT.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.653
WELL, THEN WHOSE IS IT?

09:13.186 --> 09:14.755
YOURS.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.858
OH. YEAH.

09:17.891 --> 09:21.061
YEAH. SO IT IS.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.933
HEY, MOVE OVER.
I CAN'T SEE THE SCREEN.

09:25.966 --> 09:26.900
YOU THINK
I CAN SEE?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.802
OW! GET OFF
MY FOOT! GOD!

09:28.836 --> 09:30.303
HEY, KID,
GIVE ME THAT TV.

09:30.337 --> 09:33.607
HEY, HANDS OFF,
NO-NECK.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.610
EVERYBODY JUST
RELAX, ALL RIGHT?

09:36.644 --> 09:38.045
I'LL DESCRIBE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.346
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.348
ALL RIGHT.
SO, THE GUY'S
KICKING THE BALL--

09:41.381 --> 09:43.250
WHAT IS IT?
A PUNT OR A FIELD GOAL?

09:43.283 --> 09:44.084
WHAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE?

09:44.117 --> 09:45.152
WELL, WAS ANYBODY
HOLDING IT FOR HIM?

09:45.185 --> 09:47.621
I DON'T KNOW.
THAT PART'S OVER.
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

09:47.655 --> 09:48.856
N-N-NOW, DID HE
CATCH THE KICK?

09:48.889 --> 09:50.624
I DON'T KNOW. YOU
WERE TALKING TO ME.

09:50.658 --> 09:51.591
WELL, WHAT'S
HAPPENIN' NOW?

09:51.625 --> 09:53.994
STOP YELLING AT ME.
YOU'RE MAKING ME
NERVOUS.

09:54.027 --> 09:54.928
OH, MAN!
OH!

09:54.962 --> 09:55.963
KID, DO YOU
KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT FOOTBALL?

09:55.996 --> 09:57.698
I KNOW THAT IT'S
PLAYED BY A BUNCH
OF MUSCLEHEADS

09:57.731 --> 10:00.367
WHO CAN'T EVEN
COUNT THEIR TOES.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.502
HEY, I USED
TO PLAY FOOTBALL.

10:02.535 --> 10:07.607
OH, WELL, GO AHEAD
AND TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES,
AND WE'LL GIVE YOU A HAND.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.410
I'VE GOT
ICE-CREAM SANDWICHES.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.344
I'LL TAKE
ONE OF THOSE.

10:11.378 --> 10:12.345
I DON'T THINK
YOU HEARD ME.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.782
I SAID I'VE GOT
ICE-CREAM SANDWICHES.

10:14.815 --> 10:15.649
WELL, THAT SUCKS.

10:15.683 --> 10:19.019
NAH. I'M JUST KIDDIN'.
I'LL SELL YOU ONE.

10:19.052 --> 10:22.656
WELL, IT'S NICE THAT
YOU CAN SHARE YOUR STASH
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

10:22.690 --> 10:23.891
YEAH. THANKS, DAD.

10:23.924 --> 10:28.228
NO, REALLY.
MAYBE YOU CAN BUY HER
A HOOKER FOR HER BIRTHDAY.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.964
WHY WOULD I BUY HER
A HOOKER?

10:30.998 --> 10:32.933
TO SMOKE HER WEED IN.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.301
IT'S CALLED
A HOOKAH.

10:34.334 --> 10:38.005
WELL, YOU OUGHTA KNOW,
WASTE-CASE.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.907
HI, BABE. WAS EDDIE
IN OUR BEDROOM?

10:39.940 --> 10:40.708
I DON'T KNOW. WHY?

10:40.741 --> 10:43.176
'CAUSE, UH, 'CAUSE
I FOUND A LITTLE--

10:43.210 --> 10:45.012
SOME ITEM
ON OUR, UH, BED.

10:45.045 --> 10:49.016
OH, DON'T WORRY, CLAUDIA.
I'M HIP TO THE POT SCENE.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.818
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

10:50.851 --> 10:51.885
CLAUDIA, I DIDN'T
WANNA WORRY YOU,

10:51.919 --> 10:53.453
BUT I FOUND
THAT POT ON LILY.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.822
LILY HAS POT?

10:54.855 --> 10:57.257
HAD. SHE HAD.
I TOOK IT FROM HER.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.158
TOOK IT BACK!

10:58.191 --> 11:01.294
DAD,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO WATCH THE GAME?

11:01.328 --> 11:03.030
IT WAS SEAN'S.

11:03.063 --> 11:03.931
YOU HAD THE POT?

11:03.964 --> 11:05.966
YES! YES.
AND THEN LILY
TOOK IT FROM ME.

11:05.999 --> 11:06.934
AND SHE SMOKED IT?

11:06.967 --> 11:08.035
NO! ABSOLUTELY NOT.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.202
I GOT TO HER
JUST IN TIME,

11:09.236 --> 11:11.972
AND I HANDLED IT
VERY BEAUTIFULLY.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.708
WHERE YOU GOT THE POT
IS NOT RELEVANT.

11:14.742 --> 11:15.709
I GOT IT FROM YOU.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.845
LIKE I SAID,
NOT RELEVANT.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.046
THE QUESTION IS,

11:19.079 --> 11:19.747
WHY DO YOU HAVE IT?

11:19.780 --> 11:21.815
DAD, I WASN'T
LOOKING FOR IT.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.050
I JUST WANTED
A SWEATER.

11:23.083 --> 11:26.720
MOM, WHERE'S
YOUR RED SWEATER?

11:26.754 --> 11:28.121
Claudia:
YOU CAN'T WEAR IT!

11:28.155 --> 11:30.257
I'M NOT GOING TO.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.391
WHERE IS IT?

11:31.424 --> 11:34.227
GET OUT
OF MY CLOSET!

11:39.800 --> 11:40.768
WHOA.

11:40.801 --> 11:41.701
AND WHAT
WERE YOU THINKING
OF DOIN' WITH THIS?

11:41.735 --> 11:44.037
WELL, I WAS
GONNA SMOKE IT ALL
AND GO CRAZY

11:44.071 --> 11:46.239
AS A WARNING
FOR OTHER TEENS.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.108
COME ON.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.476
DAD, WHAT
DO YOU THINK?

11:49.509 --> 11:51.845
I'M NOT
A KID ANYMORE.
I'M CURIOUS.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.446
WHAT ABOUT
ALL THOSE TIMES
I TOLD YOU

11:53.480 --> 11:54.714
DON'T DO DRUGS.

11:54.748 --> 11:57.117
WELL, THAT'S BEFORE
I REALIZED YOU DIDN'T
WANT ME TO DO YOURS.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.953
COME ON. THIS STUFF'S
BEEN IN MY CLOSET
FOR YEARS.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.789
AND WHY SHOULD I
BELIEVE THAT?

12:01.822 --> 12:03.156
OK. I ADMIT IT.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.759
I'VE SMOKED POT
IN MY PAST.

12:05.793 --> 12:06.827
OK? BUT BELIEVE ME,

12:06.860 --> 12:08.328
THEY WERE NOT
MY FINEST HOURS.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.798
WHOO! SO, THE GUY'S
OUT IN THE WOODS--
HEE HEE HEE!

12:10.831 --> 12:12.800
HE'S GOT--HE'S GOT
HIS GUN, AND HE'S--

12:12.833 --> 12:13.967
HE'S, LIKE,
BEAR HUNTIN',

12:14.001 --> 12:16.303
AND THEN HE SEES
THE BEAR, AND--POW!

12:16.336 --> 12:17.237
AND HE MISSES THE BEAR,

12:17.270 --> 12:18.405
AND THEN
THE BEAR COMES OVER,

12:18.438 --> 12:21.308
AND HE JUST TEARS
THIS DUDE'S PANTS OFF,
AND HE'S, LIKE--

12:21.341 --> 12:26.313
HEE HEE HEE!
HEE HEE HEE!

12:26.346 --> 12:28.015
HAVE YOU HEARD
THIS ONE?

12:28.048 --> 12:28.816
NO.

12:28.849 --> 12:29.449
SO--HEE HEE HEE!

12:29.482 --> 12:30.250
HEE HEE HEE!
HEE HEE HEE!

12:30.283 --> 12:31.985
SO, WAIT. HE COMES
BACK IN THE WOODS,

12:32.019 --> 12:34.487
AND HE'S GOT--HE'S GOT,
LIKE, A TANK, YOU KNOW?

12:34.521 --> 12:36.790
AND, HE, LIKE--BOOM!
HE KILLS THE BEAR!

12:36.824 --> 12:40.493
NO, THE BEAR'S NOT DEAD,
'CAUSE THE BEAR SAYS--

12:40.527 --> 12:41.728
HEE HEE HEE!

12:41.761 --> 12:44.564
HE GOES, YOU DON'T
COME OUT HERE TO HUNT,
DO YOU? HEE HEE HEE!

12:44.597 --> 12:47.367
Eddie: NO, NO, NO.
YOU'RE TELLIN' IT WRONG.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.869
THERE'S THIS HUNTER--

12:48.902 --> 12:49.669
RIGHT.

12:49.702 --> 12:52.973
AND HE'S HUNTIN'
A BEAR--HEE HEE HEE!

12:53.006 --> 12:54.041
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.043
THAT'S THE POINT.
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.210
IT'S STUPID.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.412
I WAS STUPID.
THAT'S WHAT POT DOES.
IT MAKES YOU STUPID.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.148
SO, JUST--JUST
DO ME A FAVOR,

13:01.181 --> 13:04.317
OK? JUST LEARN
FROM MY MISTAKES?

13:04.351 --> 13:06.053
OK.

13:06.086 --> 13:06.920
ALL RIGHT.

13:06.954 --> 13:09.022
YOU'RE A GREAT KID,
LILY.

13:09.056 --> 13:12.459
I MEAN THAT,
AND I'M GLAD
WE HAD THIS TALK.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.294
ME, TOO.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.129
HEY, W-W-WHAT
ARE YOU DOIN'?

13:16.163 --> 13:17.197
I'M TAKIN' THIS
TO THE PARTY.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.198
DIDN'T YOU HEAR A WORD
I JUST SAID?

13:18.231 --> 13:20.901
YEAH, BUT I ALREADY
TOLD MY FRIENDS
I HAD IT.

13:20.934 --> 13:21.902
I'LL LOOK
LIKE A LIAR.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.236
AW, THAT'S
A REAL DAMN SHAME.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.172
DAD, WHAT ABOUT
THAT WHOLE STORY
YOU JUST TOLD ME

13:25.205 --> 13:27.340
ABOUT
ALWAYS KEEPING
YOUR PROMISES?

13:27.374 --> 13:29.009
THERE WAS NOTHIN'
LIKE THAT IN MY STORY.

13:29.042 --> 13:32.145
I THOUGHT THE BEAR
REPRESENTED TRUTH
AND HONESTY.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.915
OK. LOOK, LILY.
I CAN'T STOP YOU
FROM TRYIN' POT,

13:34.948 --> 13:38.085
BUT I CAN STOP YOU
FROM TRYIN' THIS POT.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.055
WELL,
SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT,

13:42.089 --> 13:45.192
BUT I'D RATHER BE
RIGHT THAN POPULAR.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.627
WOW. I AM
REALLY IMPRESSED.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.295
THANK YOU.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.897
CAN I ASK YOU
ONE QUESTION?

13:49.930 --> 13:50.663
SURE.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.199
WHY DO YOU HAVE POT
IN OUR HOUSE?

13:52.232 --> 13:54.434
I--I DON'T SEE
HOW THAT'S GERMANE.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.369
OUR DAUGHTER
WOULDN'T HAVE IT

13:56.403 --> 13:57.337
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE IT.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.239
OK. COME ON.
IF SHE REALLY
WANTED TO TRY POT,

13:59.272 --> 14:01.208
SHE'S GONNA GET HER
HANDS ON IT ONE WAY
OR ANOTHER.

14:01.241 --> 14:04.011
Eddie: YEAH.
IT WILL GROW ANYWHERE.

14:05.212 --> 14:08.181
THROW A COUPLE OF SEEDS
IN A BROKEN BIRDBATH,

14:08.215 --> 14:11.251
NEXT THING YOU KNOW
YOU GOT A 5-FOOT PLANT.

14:11.952 --> 14:15.088
THAT'S WHAT'S GROWING
IN MY BIRDBATH?

14:15.122 --> 14:16.623
NO. NO, DAD.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.158
YOU TOLD ME
IT WAS CANNABIS.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.927
IT IS, IT IS.
I PROMISE.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.361
WELL, IT BETTER BE!

14:21.394 --> 14:25.098
SO, WHAT, ARE YOU
GIVING ALL OUR BEERS OVER
TO O'KEEFE AND HIS BUDDIES?

14:25.132 --> 14:29.069
GIVING THEM? NO.
I'M NOT GIVING THEM.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.172
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.008
OH, COME ON.
WHY ARE YOU ON
SUCH A HIGH HORSE?

14:35.042 --> 14:36.176
YOU'RE NO BETTER
THAN I AM.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.278
UH, I AM BETTER THAN YOU.

14:38.311 --> 14:41.681
OH, OH, OK. COME ON.
LIKE YOU NEVER
TOKED IT UP BEFORE?

14:41.714 --> 14:43.683
A LITTLE. BUT...

14:43.716 --> 14:45.118
YOU REMEMBER
WHAT IT DID TO ME.

14:45.152 --> 14:48.221
SO THEY'RE SNEAKIN'
THROUGH THE WOODS,

14:48.255 --> 14:51.091
AND THE BEAR
COMES UP BEHIND HIM
AND TEARS OFF HIS PANTS,

14:51.124 --> 14:52.159
AND HE STARTS
DOIN' HIM--

14:52.192 --> 14:53.927
KNOCK IT OFF!

14:53.961 --> 14:54.527
WHAT?

14:54.561 --> 14:56.063
STOP TALKIN' ABOUT BEARS.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.030
WHAT, ARE YOU SCARED?

14:57.064 --> 14:58.198
WE'RE OUT IN THE WOODS.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.466
WE'RE 20 FEET
FROM WHITE CASTLE.

14:59.499 --> 15:03.303
OH, EXCEPT LAST YEAR,
REMEMBER, THERE WERE
THOSE 2 KODIAK BEARS

15:03.336 --> 15:05.305
THAT ESCAPED FROM
THE STATEN ISLAND ZOO.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.573
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.
SHUT UP!

15:06.606 --> 15:08.608
YEAH, I'M SERIOUS.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.477
WAS...
WH

15:10.510 --> 15:11.444
WH

15:11.478 --> 15:14.047
NO, THAT WAS--
THAT WAS, LIKE,
A KODIAK BEAR.

15:14.081 --> 15:14.847
OH, GOD!

15:14.881 --> 15:16.149
STOP IT!
WE BETTER
GET OUT OF HERE.

15:16.183 --> 15:17.584
DON'T SHOW FEAR!
IT JUST ATTRACTS THEM!

15:17.617 --> 15:20.253
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH!
NO, NO!

15:20.287 --> 15:21.154
NO!

15:21.188 --> 15:22.155
AAH! AAH!

15:22.189 --> 15:24.624
HA HA HA!

15:24.657 --> 15:26.093
BABE, COME ON.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.127
WE'RE DIFFERENT
PEOPLE NOW.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.297
WE DON'T HANG OUT BEHIND
THE WHITE CASTLE ANYMORE.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.498
I KNOW THAT.

15:31.531 --> 15:32.865
SO, WHY DO YOU NEED
TO HANG ON TO THE POT
ALL THESE YEARS?

15:32.899 --> 15:37.270
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,
WHY DO YOU HANG ON TO
YOUR BRIDESMAID DRESSES?

15:37.304 --> 15:38.638
YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA WEAR THEM.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.473
THEY'RE EXPENSIVE.

15:40.507 --> 15:43.276
SO IS POT!

15:44.144 --> 15:47.080
YES, BUT I'M NOT WORRIED
THE KIDS ARE GONNA FIND THEM.

15:47.114 --> 15:50.150
ARE YOU FORGETTING
SOMETHING?

15:51.351 --> 15:54.087
I'M A LADY!

15:59.159 --> 16:00.627
I'M GONNA
THROW THIS AWAY.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.395
FINE. WAIT!

16:02.429 --> 16:04.764
YOU'RE GONNA
THROW IT AWAY?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.599
WHAT? YOU
WANNA SMOKE IT?

16:06.633 --> 16:07.400
NO!

16:07.434 --> 16:08.601
N-NO, NO!

16:08.635 --> 16:10.037
WELL, I'M
THROWING IT AWAY.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.471
FINE. GOOD.
FINE.

16:11.504 --> 16:12.672
HOLD ON A SECOND!

16:12.705 --> 16:13.640
WHAT?

16:13.673 --> 16:15.575
WELL, IT'S JUST...

16:15.608 --> 16:17.377
I JUST LIKE
HAVIN' IT AROUND.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.345
IT'S NOT LIKE
I WANNA SMOKE IT.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.780
IT'S JUST NICE TO KNOW
I COULD IF I WANTED TO.

16:20.813 --> 16:24.551
IT'S LIKE
MY SECURITY POT, YOU KNOW?

16:24.584 --> 16:29.189
I MEAN, YOU DO
REALIZE THAT EVEN
IF YOU DID SMOKE IT,

16:29.222 --> 16:31.358
YOU WOULDN'T MAGICALLY
BECOME A TEENAGER

16:31.391 --> 16:33.160
WITH NO
RESPONSIBILITIES, RIGHT?

16:33.193 --> 16:34.694
YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:34.727 --> 16:35.595
THROW IT AWAY.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.364
JUST THROW IT AWAY.

16:37.397 --> 16:38.231
OK.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.067
HOLD ON A SECOND!

16:40.100 --> 16:41.134
LET ME DO IT.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.235
ALL RIGHT.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.436
OK.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.638
GOOD-BYE.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.343
WAIT A MINUTE.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.112
THIS IS OREGANO.

16:52.545 --> 16:53.380
WHAT?

16:53.413 --> 16:54.314
YEAH!
THAT'S OREGANO!

16:54.347 --> 16:56.116
OH, MY GOD. LILY!

16:56.149 --> 16:59.619
LILY STOLE MY WEED!

17:00.620 --> 17:01.454
ALL RIGHT.

17:01.488 --> 17:02.122
WELL, HERE'S THE SNAP.

17:02.155 --> 17:02.955
THE QUARTERBACK
DROPS BACK.

17:02.989 --> 17:05.158
IT'S A REVERSE!
NO, A DOUBLE REVERSE!

17:05.192 --> 17:06.559
OH, MAN, THE DEFENSE
IS TOTALLY SUCKERED!

17:06.593 --> 17:10.330
HE'S AT THE 30, THE 20,
ONE MAN TO BEAT...

17:10.363 --> 17:10.997
TOUCHDOWN!

17:11.030 --> 17:12.332
AND WE'RE TIED!

17:12.365 --> 17:13.633
UNBELIEVABLE!
WHAT A GAME!

17:13.666 --> 17:16.836
OH, MAN, THIS IS GREAT!
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALMOST
LIKE WE'RE THERE!

17:16.869 --> 17:18.771
YOU KNOW, IN FRONT
OF THE TELEVISION.

17:18.805 --> 17:19.806
YEAH!

17:19.839 --> 17:20.673
I'M GONNA KILL HER.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.409
I'M GONNA DRIVE
OVER THERE, PICK HER UP,

17:22.442 --> 17:23.810
TAKE HER BACK HERE,
AND KILL HER.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.112
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHERE SHE IS?

17:25.145 --> 17:26.713
YEAH, YEAH.
SHE'S AT ALISON'S HOUSE.

17:26.746 --> 17:27.480
WHICH IS WHERE?

17:27.514 --> 17:29.182
OH, GOD. I'LL
HAVE TO LOOK IT UP.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.184
THAT'S, UH,
MR. AND MRS...

17:31.218 --> 17:31.951
ALISON'S DAD?

17:31.984 --> 17:33.753
HE, YOU KNOW,
HE'S GOT A MUSTACHE.

17:33.786 --> 17:34.821
HE DRIVES
A GREEN ACCORD.

17:34.854 --> 17:37.290
TELL THE OPERATOR.
I'M SURE SHE CAN
TRACK HIM DOWN.

17:37.324 --> 17:39.092
OH, GOD. YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO. THIS IS BETTER.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.427
THIS IS BETTER.
I'M JUST GONNA WAIT.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.394
I'M GONNA WAIT AND STEW.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.696
SHE'S GONNA WISH I'D
GOTTEN TO HER FIRST. YES!

17:43.730 --> 17:48.435
THIS IS
GETTING WORSE FOR HER
EVERY PASSING SECOND.

17:48.468 --> 17:49.336
HI. I'M HOME.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.371
YOU GUYS REMEMBER ALISON
AND ALISON'S DAD?

17:51.404 --> 17:52.405
THAT'S HIM.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.407
SHAVED YOUR MUSTACHE.
STILL KNOW IT'S YOU,
BUDDY.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.743
SO, ARE YOU GUYS
ENJOYING THE GAME?

17:56.776 --> 17:59.346
OH. YEAH, YEAH.
OF COURSE.

17:59.379 --> 18:00.847
YEAH. GREAT
COMMERCIALS,
HUH?

18:00.880 --> 18:01.781
HA HA HA! THOSE
ARE THE BEST PART.

18:01.814 --> 18:02.782
ALWAYS. YOU KNOW, LIKE
THE DORITO COMMERCIAL

18:02.815 --> 18:05.285
WITH THE GIRL
IN THE LAUNDROMAT--
WHIR WHIR--

18:05.318 --> 18:07.287
AND SHE CATCHES
THE DORITO IN HER MOUTH?

18:07.320 --> 18:08.821
GIVE ME BACK MY POT!

18:08.855 --> 18:09.656
WHAT?

18:09.689 --> 18:12.225
YOU STOLE MY POT,
AND I WANT IT BACK!

18:12.259 --> 18:13.293
HONEY?

18:13.326 --> 18:14.794
OK. BYE.

18:15.928 --> 18:16.763
WHAT?!

18:16.796 --> 18:17.697
I TRUSTED YOU.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.733
I TOLD YOU
DEGRADING STORIES
FROM MY PAST.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.369
I DIDN'T TAKE IT.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.537
HA HA HA. THEN
PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US

18:24.571 --> 18:27.174
HOW THIS BAG
GOT FULL OF OREGANO.

18:27.207 --> 18:27.840
OREGANO?

18:27.874 --> 18:29.742
OH! DON'T PLAY DUMB, LILY.

18:29.776 --> 18:30.877
WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

18:30.910 --> 18:31.911
SEAN, CALM DOWN.

18:31.944 --> 18:32.745
OH, WHAT? I'M GONNA TAKE
PARENTING ADVICE FROM YOU?

18:32.779 --> 18:33.713
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW--
COME ON, EDDIE!

18:33.746 --> 18:38.418
THE STUFF IN THAT BAG
HAS ALWAYS BEEN OREGANO.

18:39.519 --> 18:40.420
WHAT?

18:40.453 --> 18:41.621
REMEMBER WHEN I USED
TO WORK AT RAY'S PIZZA?

18:41.654 --> 18:45.124
YOU REMEMBER THAT?
REMEMBER WHEN YOU
USED TO COME IN?

18:49.229 --> 18:49.929
SEE YOUR GUY?

18:49.962 --> 18:51.398
YEAH. SAW MY GUY.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.865
YOU GOT IT?

18:52.899 --> 18:54.434
I GOT IT.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.469
ALL RIGHT.

18:56.503 --> 18:57.404
TAKE IT EASY
WITH THAT STUFF.

18:57.437 --> 19:00.907
THAT'S GOOD STUFF.
YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S FROM?

19:00.940 --> 19:03.243
IT'S FROM MARYLAND.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

19:03.276 --> 19:03.876
MM-MMM.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.878
THAT MEANS IT'S GOOD.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.816
EXCUSE ME. SORRY.

19:09.849 --> 19:10.650
UH, THIS IS EMPTY.

19:10.683 --> 19:11.884
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME?

19:11.918 --> 19:15.322
THAT'S
A POPULAR SPICE.

19:16.589 --> 19:17.257
EDDIE!

19:17.290 --> 19:18.591
YOU HAD 2 CHILDREN
AT THE TIME.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.260
I WAS LOOKIN'
OUT FOR YOU.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.093
NO, YOU WEREN'T.

19:21.127 --> 19:23.530
OK. A COUPLE OF
MY FRIENDS CAME OVER,

19:23.563 --> 19:25.298
AND YOUR HALF
GOT KINDA, YOU KNOW...

19:25.332 --> 19:28.468
ALL RIGHT. WELL, HEY,
THANKS FOR RIPPIN' ME OFF.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.736
AH.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.673
OH, GOD. YOU KNOW WHAT,
I HOPE YOU LEARNED
YOUR LESSON.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.343
WHAT, DON'T BUY POT
FROM UNCLE EDDIE?

19:36.376 --> 19:37.544
NO!

19:37.577 --> 19:38.611
NO. NO.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.947
IF YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT USIN' DRUGS,
REMEMBER THIS:

19:40.980 --> 19:42.482
YOUR FATHER
LOVES YOU VERY MUCH,

19:42.515 --> 19:45.485
HE'S CRAZY, AND
HE OWNS A CIRCULAR SAW.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.887
GOT IT.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.289
ALL RIGHT.
SO, IT'S A TIE GAME.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.491
THE QUARTERBACK
TAKES A SHOTGUN SNAP.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.492
HE DROPS BACK TO PASS.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.593
BLITZ! OH, MY GOD!

19:53.626 --> 19:54.727
THEY'VE
TORN HIS ARM OFF!

19:54.761 --> 19:56.663
NOW THEY'RE
HITTING HIM WITH IT!

19:56.696 --> 19:58.698
HOW CAN THAT
NOT BE A PENALTY?

19:58.731 --> 20:00.800
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

20:00.833 --> 20:02.569
LET ME SEE THAT!

20:04.003 --> 20:04.971
HEY, THE POWER'S BACK!

20:05.004 --> 20:07.574
Announcer: SO, AT THE END
OF THE THIRD QUARTER,

20:07.607 --> 20:09.776
OUR SCORE REMAINS 43-6.

20:10.410 --> 20:13.246
43-6!
THAT'S A BLOWOUT!

20:13.280 --> 20:14.881
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE TIE GAME?

20:14.914 --> 20:16.949
YOU LIED TO US!

20:16.983 --> 20:17.884
LIED?

20:17.917 --> 20:21.220
IT WAS A BORING GAME.
I MADE IT INTERESTING!

20:21.588 --> 20:24.457
I DID IT FOR YOU!

20:25.325 --> 20:26.993
NO-NECKS!

20:28.295 --> 20:29.762
I WOULDN'T BE SO HARD
ON YOUR DAD.

20:29.796 --> 20:30.663
HE'S JUST
LOOKIN' OUT FOR YOU.

20:30.697 --> 20:33.433
HE'S PERSECUTING ME.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.602
YEAH. RIGHT.
SO YOU KEEP SAYIN'.

20:35.635 --> 20:36.936
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

20:36.969 --> 20:40.407
THERE'S NO CHANCE IN HELL
THAT YOU DIDN'T PINCH
SOME OF THAT WEED.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.410
IT WASN'T WEED.
IT WAS PIZZA TOPPING.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.911
AND YOU SMOKED IT.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.947
HA HA HA!

20:47.980 --> 20:49.282
OK. WE SMOKED IT.

20:49.316 --> 20:51.751
GOD,
WE'RE SUCH IDIOTS!

20:51.784 --> 20:56.656
HEE HEE HEE!
I'M SO WASTED!

20:57.657 --> 21:01.928
HOW MANY FINGERS
AM I HOLDING UP?

21:01.961 --> 21:02.962
OH, MY GOD.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.732
THAT DOESN'T EVEN
LOOK LIKE A HAND.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.571
I'M SO STARVING!

21:11.604 --> 21:13.039
OOH, ME, TOO!

21:13.072 --> 21:14.707
I BET WE GOT
THE MUNCHIES.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.376
WE DO?

21:16.409 --> 21:17.477
HEE HEE HEE!

21:17.510 --> 21:20.580
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT I COULD REALLY
GO FOR A PIZZA.

21:24.984 --> 21:28.588
YOU KNOW, I COULD
HOOK YOU UP WITH
SOME PRIMO BASIL.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.590
OK.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.223
LEAVE ME ALONE.

21:31.257 --> 21:32.525
HEY, IT'S MELLOW,
MELLOW--

21:32.559 --> 21:35.061
STOP IT!

21:37.464 --> 21:38.865
COME ON. OPEN IT UP.

21:38.898 --> 21:39.532
NO.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.768
THE COFFIN
IS FULL OF CANDY.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.336
YOU'RE LYING.

21:43.370 --> 21:44.737
MOM! MOM!

21:44.771 --> 21:45.972
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

21:46.005 --> 21:47.640
HE'S SCARING ME.

21:47.674 --> 21:48.775
HE WON'T LET ME OUT.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.076
HE STARTED IT.

21:50.109 --> 21:52.111
HEY! I DON'T CARE
WHO STARTED IT.

21:52.144 --> 21:55.682
I'M FINISHING IT.
BOTH OF YOU, BE QUIET.

21:56.015 --> 21:56.649
GOOD WORK, MORON.

21:56.683 --> 21:57.617
YOU GOT US BOTH
IN TROUBLE.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.487
"GOOD WORK, MORON.
YOU GOT US BOTH IN TROUBLE."

22:00.520 --> 22:02.822
SHUT UP.
"SHUT UP."

22:03.923 --> 22:04.924
OW!
