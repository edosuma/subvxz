WEBVTT

00:05.639 --> 00:08.916
Yes! Wake up, girl.
We 're going to the races!

00:10.177 --> 00:11.781
Ladies and Gentlemen!

00:11.879 --> 00:15.053
The race
you have all been waiting for!

00:19.553 --> 00:21.590
Alright, kiddo. What is
it you want for your birthday?

00:21.688 --> 00:23.395
- I was thinking on a dog.
- Dog?

00:23.490 --> 00:24.901
I wanna enter my dog in the race.

00:24.992 --> 00:26.733
<i>How much would you
take for that dog?</i>

00:26.827 --> 00:28.204
She's not for sale.

00:28.295 --> 00:30.400
She made it in three...

00:30.497 --> 00:34.138
<i>Indiana? We can't afford
to go to a dog race in Indiana!</i>

00:34.234 --> 00:36.840
I think Shelly hurl her leg.
Please help her.

00:36.937 --> 00:39.645
Fast little friend
is a bit of a pushover.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.720
I don't trust this
Ms. Merry weather woman.

00:41.808 --> 00:44.118
I don't race for the
money, I race for the dignity.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.714
And you got his name
because he had a birthrnark.

00:46.813 --> 00:48.156
Just like the one Shelly has!

00:48.248 --> 00:52.094
May the best Wiener win
and the rest roast!

01:31.658 --> 01:33.695
Hey, Shelly. What do you think?

01:37.364 --> 01:39.310
Really wish I knew What
you were thinking.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.644
Good morning!

01:45.739 --> 01:46.979
Ready for the big day?

01:47.074 --> 01:49.452
As ready as I'll ever be.

01:49.543 --> 01:54.049
Hey, I'm really sorry that vve had to
cancel going to the Internationals, bud.

01:54.147 --> 01:55.387
I know how much that meant to you.

01:55.482 --> 01:57.655
I know how much this means to you.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.856
Yeah, well,
We're starting a family.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.368
Sort of a race in itself, right?

02:03.457 --> 02:04.800
That's a race?

02:05.459 --> 02:07.803
Well, more like a marathon.

02:09.329 --> 02:13.038
You know, I'm sad about missing
the Internationals,

02:13.133 --> 02:16.410
but I'm happy that you're happy.

02:16.503 --> 02:19.109
Well, I'll be happy
if she says yes.

02:19.206 --> 02:20.742
She will.

02:21.908 --> 02:24.582
Alright, well, go get your
brother and sister up.

02:24.678 --> 02:25.986
I gotta get goin'.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.722
Alright, you kids
be good While I'm gone.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.457
- We will.
- No fighting.

02:34.955 --> 02:35.956
We'll play nice.

02:36.056 --> 02:38.332
- And get to bed on time.
- I'll get them to bed.

02:38.425 --> 02:39.961
Yeah, that goes for you, too.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.400
You guys sure
you're OK with this?

02:44.498 --> 02:46.034
Bringing Melanie
officially into the family?

02:46.133 --> 02:49.205
She became a part of this family
the second she stood up for Shelly.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.681
Alright, cool. Alright, well as soon
as she gets moved in

02:53.774 --> 02:56.448
and this feels real,
then I'm sure everything will be fine.

02:56.543 --> 02:58.250
No, it'll be better than fine.
It'll be awesome!

02:59.212 --> 03:00.190
Am I over doing it?

03:00.280 --> 03:03.124
Yes. Go.
Before she changes her mind.

03:03.216 --> 03:06.561
Alright. This will be simple.
Go to Paris, propose,

03:06.653 --> 03:11.727
she says yes, vve come back here
and she lives with us. Forever.

03:11.825 --> 03:14.203
- Nervous?
- No...

03:17.698 --> 03:18.768
Yes.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.641
It's OK, Dad. You've got us
to get you through it.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.806
- Alright, well, I love you guys.
- Love you, too.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.008
Aunt Jenny is gonna be here tomorrow

03:25.105 --> 03:26.413
and she's gonna cook for you
guys for a couple of days

03:26.506 --> 03:28.417
and take care of you, alright?
Be good for her.

03:28.508 --> 03:30.510
Relax. We've got it.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.146
Alright.

03:35.182 --> 03:38.026
- I mean it, please.
- We will.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.859
Bye I

03:39.953 --> 03:42.331
- Good luck!
- See ya!

03:42.422 --> 03:45.232
Well, Dad has officially left us
alone to fend for ourselves.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.839
I know. Isn't it great?

03:47.928 --> 03:49.771
Hey, love will
make you do crazy things.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.774
I still can't believe
he's going to propose

03:51.865 --> 03:53.708
the same week as the Internationals.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.178
It's the only week he could
take off. You know that.

03:56.269 --> 03:58.545
Well, since I'm in charge now,

03:58.638 --> 04:01.448
there's gonna be no more talking
about Wiener dog races, OK?

04:01.541 --> 04:03.487
That's, like,
all I have to talk about.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.955
Alright, well...
go clean your room!

04:06.046 --> 04:07.024
What?

04:07.114 --> 04:09.754
Relax, I'm just kidding.
Go clean my room.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.757
Here, girl,
have some Canine Caviar.

04:19.559 --> 04:22.335
You're so lucky
your food's already made.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.376
I know it's good, but it'll still
be there when you get back.

04:32.773 --> 04:36.050
- Danny Jack?
- Yes.

04:36.143 --> 04:39.420
Is it true Shelly will not be
racing in this years Internationals?

04:41.615 --> 04:43.754
Come on kid,
just gimme a sound bite.

04:45.418 --> 04:48.558
It's true.
It's not What I wanted.

04:49.689 --> 04:51.396
It's not what we wanted.

04:51.491 --> 04:52.868
But it's bigger than just us.

04:54.194 --> 04:56.105
This has to do with
our whole family.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.641
I can't say
What our Dad's doing right now

04:59.733 --> 05:04.204
because it's a surprise,
but We're happy for him.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.910
We're also really sad to be--

05:07.007 --> 05:09.715
Quitting.
ls something Wrong with Shelly?

05:10.544 --> 05:12.581
Has Shelly not been working out?

05:12.679 --> 05:14.818
Tell me, really.
ls something Wrong with the dog?

05:16.016 --> 05:17.757
Hey, What do you
think you're doing?

05:17.851 --> 05:18.955
Are you Skip?

05:19.052 --> 05:22.056
You can't just walk on our
property and roll cameras.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.102
- Get outta here! Come on.
- But I wanna be a movie star!

05:25.192 --> 05:27.468
- Goodbye. Goodbye.
- Will Shelly be racing next year?

05:31.364 --> 05:32.866
Who's on our lawn?

05:32.966 --> 05:37.415
It's just the neighbor girl.
She is so Weird.

05:39.439 --> 05:42.648
Here you go. Here you go.

05:45.745 --> 05:47.554
Wow. You cooked this?

05:47.647 --> 05:49.024
I thought you didn't know
hovv to cook.

05:49.115 --> 05:51.095
Relax. Dad made it
before he left.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.219
- Oh.
- I thought so.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.765
Your cooking
usually comes out of a box.

05:54.855 --> 05:58.064
And includes the directions
"just add water".

05:58.158 --> 05:59.967
Ya better eat up too, girl.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.635
Can we take Shelly
on a walk after dinner?

06:05.465 --> 06:07.604
Do you think we'll see any
more reporters? How's my hair?

06:07.701 --> 06:11.171
I don't know, how's mine'?
Hey--

06:11.271 --> 06:14.377
You two can go on a walk but no more
talking about Wiener clog races, OK'?

06:14.474 --> 06:15.475
OK.

06:16.309 --> 06:21.122
You're lucky you can't talk.
Skip is so mean.

06:27.354 --> 06:30.858
OK, the only one that should be
giving me puppy dog eyes is Shelly.

06:31.758 --> 06:34.602
'Cause she is a puppy dog.

06:34.694 --> 06:39.143
I don't need a guilt trip from
either one of you. OK? Novv eat.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.238
What if we go to the Internationals?

06:45.338 --> 06:47.147
You know, just for a little bit.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.447
Danny! Just for a little bit?

06:49.542 --> 06:52.022
The races are like
thousands of miles away.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.023
Yeah, but--

06:54.114 --> 06:58.722
Never, ever thought I'd be saying this,
but I'm with Skip on this one.

06:58.818 --> 07:01.424
No more talking about
Wiener dog races.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.865
I mean, at least for today.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.267
Unless we see more reporters,
of course.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.305
Really, how is my hair'?

07:08.395 --> 07:10.671
There you are! I've been
looking for you everywhere.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.074
- Judge Brown.
- What have you done?

07:13.166 --> 07:16.010
- What's going on?
- You have Withdrawn from the race.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.309
You're not going to
the Wiener Dog Internationals?

07:18.405 --> 07:21.978
We can't go. Our Dad's on his
Way to propose to Melanie.

07:22.642 --> 07:25.680
Those two and their
blatant disregard for the rules!

07:25.779 --> 07:29.352
Oh, this is bad.
This is very, very bad.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.328
Wait, are you upset because
you Won't have a US racer?

07:32.419 --> 07:33.989
Well, it's not we won't have a racer,

07:34.087 --> 07:36.931
it's who we will have
if you two don't race.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.060
Can't Handshake go in our place?

07:39.159 --> 07:41.969
Or one of the other dogs
that placed in the Nationals?

07:42.062 --> 07:44.542
Does anyone read the rules,
except me?

07:44.631 --> 07:47.908
No! That's not how it works!

07:48.001 --> 07:50.447
Just as the Nationals
have a rulebook, right,

07:50.537 --> 07:52.574
now, so do the Internationals.

07:52.672 --> 07:55.175
But the International rulebook
is much bigger and thicker

07:55.275 --> 07:58.051
and longer and harder and much more
cumbersome for me to understand.

07:58.144 --> 08:01.148
Mainly because it's composed
of 37 different languages,

08:01.247 --> 08:03.591
and I don't speak
Swahili that well.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.153
So, who will
go in our place then?

08:06.252 --> 08:09.324
- Mrs. Merryvveather.
- She was disqualified!

08:09.422 --> 08:13.336
Oh, for the Nationals, yes. But this is
the Wiener Dog Internationals.

08:13.426 --> 08:16.430
- They are two separate organizations.
- What's the difference?

08:16.529 --> 08:19.601
One ends in an "N"
the other ends in an

08:19.699 --> 08:21.610
But isn't a race a race?

08:22.335 --> 08:25.578
Little Bo Bridget, you obviously have
never been to the Internationals.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.543
It's not just a race.

08:28.641 --> 08:32.589
No, it's the motherload
grand dame of all races.

08:32.679 --> 08:36.650
I must speak to your father.
Here, have him call me.

08:36.750 --> 08:40.061
We need to make sure
that you stay in the race.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.393
Now, I leave tomorrow.

08:41.488 --> 08:44.435
Perhaps, you could
ride with me if you like.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.801
I can't even look at you,
Shelly. I'm just too upset.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.306
OK, well if you insist.

08:50.397 --> 08:54.106
One, just one little itty-bitty,
teeny-weeny little pet.

08:56.302 --> 08:59.715
That's such a good puppy. Such a good,
good, good girl. Yes, it is.

08:59.806 --> 09:02.844
- Judge Brown?
- Oh, well vve must speak to your father.

09:02.942 --> 09:07.152
Rule 12.23 clearly states that if you
are not in the stands at the time

09:07.247 --> 09:08.749
your race is announced,

09:08.848 --> 09:11.328
Mrs. Merryvveather
will race in your place.

09:11.418 --> 09:16.595
Now, you can sign this form
withdrawing from the race

09:16.689 --> 09:19.431
and I will contact
Mrs. Merryvveather.

09:19.526 --> 09:22.530
Or you can convince your father

09:22.629 --> 09:26.304
to let you partake
in the Wiener Dog Internationals.

09:26.399 --> 09:31.075
The choice is yours.
Choose Wisely.

09:31.171 --> 09:35.517
So, if we sign this...
can we go next year'?

09:37.243 --> 09:38.688
Yes, of course.

09:38.778 --> 09:41.987
But only as a mere spectator.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.356
Good day.

09:45.018 --> 09:49.592
So, this may really be our only
chance to go to this thing.

09:59.966 --> 10:01.536
Keepin' her warm for next year?

10:02.368 --> 10:04.439
Yeah, I guess.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.950
You khovv, I thought you two would be
having more fun giving me a hard time,

10:08.041 --> 10:10.544
making my life
all difficult and all.

10:10.643 --> 10:13.123
Is that What you expected?

10:13.213 --> 10:15.955
If I were you,
I'd be giving me a hard time.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.790
I can be more difficult on you,
if you'd like.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.921
I didn't mean for it to sound
like I was asking for it.

10:21.387 --> 10:23.526
Can I show you something?

10:23.623 --> 10:24.658
Sure.

10:48.114 --> 10:49.252
Come on!

10:57.357 --> 10:58.700
Yes!

11:04.097 --> 11:07.135
Distance divided
by time equals speed.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.270
Shelly Went 22 miles per hour!

11:09.369 --> 11:11.940
Wow. You're Way too into math.

11:12.038 --> 11:14.075
Well, I'm gonna go spend
the rest of my time inside.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.348
- Wait, Skip!
- What?

11:18.611 --> 11:20.921
- What if...
- What?

11:21.014 --> 11:23.358
What if we were to go
to the Internationals?

11:23.449 --> 11:26.794
Dad wouldn't find out,
and we'd be back before he even knew it.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.500
Not a chance.

11:30.990 --> 11:33.834
NP PUPPY Clog eyes!

11:35.195 --> 11:37.766
Well, there's always next year.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.707
Yeah, I guess so.

11:49.475 --> 11:50.749
Whatcha doin'?

11:50.843 --> 11:53.414
Trying to cheer myself up.

11:53.513 --> 11:57.893
Well, come on. Let's watch some
TV to get your mind offthings.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.555
Yes, please. I don't know
What to do with sad Danny.

12:00.653 --> 12:04.567
The Wiener Dog Internationals
is only days away,

12:04.657 --> 12:08.935
and we're told the US is unsure of who
will be sent to represent America.

12:09.028 --> 12:11.030
Oh, that's hot helping him
get his mind off the race.

12:12.498 --> 12:16.036
On one hand you have current
champion, Shelly Jack.

12:16.135 --> 12:19.412
On the other,
two-time champion, Princess.

12:19.505 --> 12:20.950
Boo!

12:21.040 --> 12:23.782
Some think Princess
is the stronger racer.

12:23.876 --> 12:29.451
It may almost be better for the US
if the Jack family lets this one g0.

12:29.549 --> 12:30.584
Hey!

12:30.683 --> 12:32.629
However, after Ms. Merryvveather

12:32.719 --> 12:37.361
was ejected from the Nationals
for unsportsman/ike conduct,

12:37.457 --> 12:40.631
it's this reporter's opinion
that the US is rooting for

12:40.727 --> 12:43.571
an honest champion,
and that's Shelly Jack.

12:43.663 --> 12:44.835
That's right!

12:44.931 --> 12:47.969
Of course, every0ne's favorite
to win is Russia.

12:48.067 --> 12:50.274
Hailing from
the small town of Birsk,

12:50.370 --> 12:53.840
the Iron Hammer is thought to
be a clear contender for the title.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.352
The Hammer will crush
the competition.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.821
The Hammer will pound you
to the ground. The Hammer will win!

13:01.114 --> 13:03.424
Ooh, she's scary.

13:03.516 --> 13:06.725
Yeah, well that puts ah end
to that. Time for bed.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.465
Omon, Shelly!

13:12.125 --> 13:14.036
This parenting thing
is not that hard.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.198
I don't know What Dad's
complaining about.

13:17.096 --> 13:18.404
Kids...

13:31.944 --> 13:33.218
l-low are you feeling?

13:35.448 --> 13:39.328
I'm happy that Dad's moved on.
I am.

13:40.920 --> 13:44.094
But I really Wanted this race.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.331
Shelly's good, you know?

13:48.127 --> 13:49.504
She's really good.

13:53.299 --> 13:56.041
Mom would have been proud
that you made it this far.

13:58.237 --> 14:00.945
- You think so?
- Of course.

14:01.040 --> 14:04.783
Nobody thought we were gonna win
anything when we acloptecl Shelly.

14:08.114 --> 14:11.687
I don't know.
This whole thing is silly.

14:11.784 --> 14:18.531
I know, but somehow it's the
only place I feel so alive.

14:19.459 --> 14:22.303
It's so... big, you know?

14:23.663 --> 14:25.870
Hey, I thought I told you guys
to get ready for bed.

14:29.168 --> 14:33.446
No puppy dog eyes!
Alright, I've had enough of this.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.212
Living room, five minutes!

14:36.042 --> 14:38.784
Living room? Five minutes?

14:38.878 --> 14:42.018
Oh, no! He's calling a meeting!

14:42.115 --> 14:44.254
He thinks he's Dad.

14:50.923 --> 14:52.459
Take a seat.

14:57.830 --> 15:00.743
- So I was thinking and--
- You're gonna let us go to the race?

15:02.235 --> 15:03.805
Let Skip speak.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.974
So I know I'm not the first
to admit that the Nationals

15:06.072 --> 15:08.985
changed our lives for
the better, but it did.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.351
And you'll never get me to
repeat that to anybody else.

15:11.444 --> 15:14.948
- That's OK. I recorded it.
- Hey! Gimme that!

15:18.718 --> 15:20.994
So, the Way I was thinking it,

15:21.087 --> 15:22.623
the Internationals might be
good for us, too.

15:22.722 --> 15:26.465
We can't let Ms. Merryvveather
race. Don't forget about her!

15:26.559 --> 15:28.368
Mean, Ms. Merryvveather.

15:28.795 --> 15:31.207
What if you two Went
with Judge Brown to compete?

15:32.665 --> 15:34.508
I mean, he's a responsible adult.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.170
He is a stand up guy.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.771
Probably a lot more
responsible than me.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.679
The best.

15:39.772 --> 15:45.688
So, if you do go race and you come
straight back, Dad may not be the wiser.

15:45.778 --> 15:49.316
So... yes?

15:49.916 --> 15:51.327
Yeah. Why not?

15:52.151 --> 15:53.221
Yes!

15:53.319 --> 15:54.855
Can vve get up and scream now?

15:55.688 --> 15:56.826
Sure.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.440
We're really going to
the Internationals?

16:06.532 --> 16:09.877
Wait, hovv are vve gonna convince
Judge Brown that Dad said yes?

16:09.969 --> 16:12.040
Leave that to me.
Go pack your bags!

16:12.638 --> 16:15.619
Come on, Shelly!
We're going to the Internationals!

16:15.708 --> 16:16.948
Come on, Shelly!

16:17.043 --> 16:18.716
Internationals!
Internationals! Internationals!

16:18.811 --> 16:20.313
Yay!

16:27.753 --> 16:30.427
Alright. Take care you two!

16:30.523 --> 16:33.504
Hey! I didn't get a hug.
Get back here!

16:33.593 --> 16:36.403
Alright, come on.

16:38.531 --> 16:41.478
I cannot believe
I'm letting you do this.

16:44.537 --> 16:47.416
- You happy now?
- Yeah.

16:48.941 --> 16:52.115
NP PUPPY 610g eyes!
I told you guys!

16:52.211 --> 16:54.248
Goodbyes are stupid anyways.

16:54.347 --> 16:58.193
Know what, you two stay together,
don't talk to strangers...

16:58.284 --> 17:01.424
Look both ways before
crossing the road. We got it.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.762
- And take care of yourselves, OK?
- We vvill.

17:03.856 --> 17:09.464
Thank you for doing this. You're
a pretty OK older brother after all.

17:09.561 --> 17:11.769
Pretty OK? OK, Whatever.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.434
Get outta here before
I change my mind.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.705
Oh, and it shouldn't take us
more than 20 minutes

17:15.800 --> 17:17.576
to get to his house.
So set an alarm.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.308
Are you afraid
I'm gonna forget or something?

17:19.405 --> 17:21.578
- Yeah.
- What do you think I am?

17:21.674 --> 17:24.314
- Our older brother.
- Get outta here.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.356
- Bye, Skip.
- Bye. See ya!

17:27.445 --> 17:29.289
Miss you already.

17:34.186 --> 17:36.723
This is probably
my worst idea ever.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.116
Go time! Hello?

17:53.205 --> 17:55.913
- Skip-a-doodle-do!
- Hey, Aunt Jenny! What's up?

17:56.008 --> 17:58.147
I'm just at the store
getting a few things,

17:58.244 --> 18:00.485
and then I'll be heading over
to see everybody real soon.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.993
Oh! I thought you weren't
coming until tonight.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.758
Well, you're in luck. I'm early.
I know.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.830
OK, Aunt Jenny,
talked to Dad

18:10.923 --> 18:12.493
and he said you
don't need to come by anymore.

18:12.592 --> 18:16.665
Really? Well, I... I... I just
got some food and I'm here.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.208
So l... well, maybe I'll...
I'll just come by for dinner

18:19.298 --> 18:20.436
and then I'll head out.
How's that?

18:21.667 --> 18:22.941
Yeah. Sounds great.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.341
Well, put one of those buckets
of sunshine on the phone.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.286
Danny and Bridget are outside
playing Cops and Robbers so...

18:33.646 --> 18:35.523
They have tape
over their mouths?

18:35.615 --> 18:37.652
They both have
tape over their mouths?

18:37.750 --> 18:38.990
I never said
they were good at it.

18:39.085 --> 18:41.793
Well, uh, Skip.
I'm not gonna ask you again.

18:41.887 --> 18:43.264
Put the kids on the phone.

18:44.690 --> 18:47.261
Danny! Bridget! Aunt Jenny
wants to talk to you!

18:49.762 --> 18:52.333
Corning! Hi, Aunt Jenny!

18:52.431 --> 18:55.742
Hi, little curly top.
ls Skip treating you OK?

18:55.835 --> 19:00.511
Skip's been great! He's doing a really
good job taking care of us.

19:02.408 --> 19:05.855
Skip's the best older brother
a little kid could ask for.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.481
We 're so super excited

19:07.580 --> 19:10.925
to be spending all this
time with him alone and bonding.

19:11.017 --> 19:13.224
It's nice
with no adults in the home.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.325
But ah...
are you two on separate lines?

19:16.422 --> 19:17.992
<i>How can you both hear me?</i>

19:18.958 --> 19:20.995
OK, have fun kids!

19:21.994 --> 19:23.701
Kids!
They Went back outside to play.

19:23.796 --> 19:26.436
Well, get 'em lined up
for when I arrive.

19:26.532 --> 19:28.944
I wanna collect me
some hug sandwiches.

19:29.635 --> 19:31.342
Sure. Definitely will do that.

19:32.271 --> 19:34.273
Bye! Awesome!

19:34.373 --> 19:36.080
So excited!

19:43.315 --> 19:45.386
I need to
come up with a new plan.

19:46.385 --> 19:48.626
Ooh, go time part two!

19:54.593 --> 19:56.937
Oh, oh, good morning.

19:58.564 --> 20:00.840
Is... that the withdrawal form?

20:02.034 --> 20:04.036
I'm so sorry
to see it end like this.

20:04.136 --> 20:06.446
I understand your father
is proposing to Melanie,

20:06.539 --> 20:09.349
but this is
a very important event.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.049
Wait...
Wait this is not signed.

20:13.145 --> 20:16.024
Nope. We're going
to the Internationals!

20:17.083 --> 20:19.563
Yeah, oh, yippee! Yeah!

20:19.652 --> 20:20.630
Yeah.

20:21.187 --> 20:23.030
We must have
your father's approval.

20:25.391 --> 20:28.531
Judge Brown.
You better get that.

20:28.627 --> 20:30.607
Oh, yes. My pockefs ringing.

20:32.665 --> 20:33.871
Hello?

20:33.966 --> 20:37.914
Judge Brown.
Do you know who this is?

20:38.003 --> 20:41.473
- No. Actually I don't.
- This is Phil Jack.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.384
Oh, oh, of course.
Yes, Phil Jack, how are you'?

20:44.477 --> 20:46.184
I'm... I'm... I'm...
It's your father.

20:46.278 --> 20:47.256
Yeah.

20:47.346 --> 20:48.916
I head that you are willing to take my
kids to the Internationals?

20:49.014 --> 20:50.152
Yes, yes, I am.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.785
I'd very much appreciate that.

20:51.884 --> 20:54.990
I heard Mrs. Merryvveather
will be taking our place so...

20:55.087 --> 20:57.658
I feel it's best
if we right this wrong.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.931
Yes, of course. I will take
excellent care of the children.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.665
And little Shelly.

21:04.163 --> 21:06.165
And vve will see you at the race,
I assume?

21:08.033 --> 21:10.639
Well of... of course!

21:10.736 --> 21:13.945
Yeah, of course.
I'll see you in a few days.

21:14.039 --> 21:16.019
Good bye.

21:16.108 --> 21:22.059
Goodbye. Well, it looks like you three
are going to the Internationals.

21:24.150 --> 21:27.154
We'll take my car.
To the Wiener Mobile!

21:28.988 --> 21:31.229
To the Wiener Mobile!

21:48.741 --> 21:50.812
We cannot let this
happen, Princess.

21:50.910 --> 21:54.414
Those kids
have gotta be stopped.

21:54.513 --> 21:58.359
Looks like you and I
are taking a road trip.

21:59.785 --> 22:00.763
Let's go!

22:01.754 --> 22:04.030
Ninety-nine hotdogs
and buns on the wall

22:04.123 --> 22:06.000
Ninety-nine,
hotdogs and buns

22:06.091 --> 22:08.935
You take one down
You pass it around

22:09.028 --> 22:11.907
Ninety-eight hotdogs
and buns on the wall

22:11.997 --> 22:13.101
Ninety-eight...

22:15.634 --> 22:18.843
- Oh, hey, Aunt Jenny!
- Hey, Skip!

22:18.938 --> 22:22.351
That was fast. Um, I was
actually on my way out.

22:22.441 --> 22:25.581
Yeah, the store was really
close. You look great!

22:26.412 --> 22:29.256
You look... like it's windy.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.792
Your car's smoking.

22:37.890 --> 22:41.360
It does that, but I'll...
I'll move it later. Look at you!

22:41.460 --> 22:42.700
SQ Q FQMV H L] F)!

22:43.863 --> 22:44.841
- OK.
- on.

22:44.930 --> 22:47.877
I suppose you're too old
for a hair ruffle and cheek pinch.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.243
- Little bit.
- Are you gonna invite me in?

22:50.336 --> 22:52.373
Oh, like I said,
I talked to Dad.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.313
He knows everything's good now.

22:54.406 --> 22:56.283
So, if you have anywhere else
to be, I mean...

22:56.375 --> 22:58.981
Nonsense. No. Where are those
two little munchkins?

22:59.078 --> 23:00.819
They're not too old for a hair
ruffle or a cheek pinch.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.187
Yeah, they're at the park.

23:02.281 --> 23:04.261
But you said they were already
playing in the backyard.

23:04.350 --> 23:06.626
But you're supposed to be
watching them at all times.

23:07.253 --> 23:09.460
Yeah, a...
well, it's a very safe park?

23:09.555 --> 23:11.000
Sounded like a question.

23:11.090 --> 23:13.764
No it's not a question,
it's just...

23:13.859 --> 23:15.566
It's a very safe park, for sure.

23:15.661 --> 23:17.163
OK, good.
Well, I tell you what...

23:17.263 --> 23:19.504
I have to run back to the store
because I forgot a few things.

23:19.598 --> 23:23.011
Oh. Oh, so you're staying.

23:23.102 --> 23:24.342
Yeah. Just for dinner,

23:24.436 --> 23:26.609
and the smoke usually means
I shouldn't drive for a few hours.

23:26.705 --> 23:29.276
Yeah, I am pretty sure that's
not supposed to happen to a car.

23:29.375 --> 23:31.480
I know, but when I say
I'm gonna run to the store,

23:31.577 --> 23:32.715
I mean I'm gonna
literally run to the store,

23:32.811 --> 23:35.257
cause I can't take the car so...
I'll see ya in a bit!

23:35.347 --> 23:36.917
OK.

23:38.384 --> 23:39.954
Crazy.

23:59.171 --> 24:01.583
Fifty-nine hotdogs
and buns on the wall

24:01.674 --> 24:04.314
Fifty-nine hotdogs and buns

24:04.410 --> 24:05.889
With relish.

24:05.978 --> 24:07.616
You take one down,
you pass it around...

24:07.713 --> 24:09.420
This is getting really boring...

24:11.350 --> 24:12.590
From the top!

24:23.429 --> 24:24.874
Can I help you?

24:24.964 --> 24:29.174
Yeah, I need a...
I'm lookin' for a Wiener dog.

24:29.268 --> 24:30.645
There's one right clown there.

24:34.606 --> 24:37.678
Yeah, that's hot a Wiener dog.
That's a pig.

24:39.611 --> 24:42.649
Alright, alright.
Excuse me, OK, but I'm in sales.

24:44.383 --> 24:47.296
Right clown there, if you want her,
you bring her up here.

24:52.624 --> 24:54.467
Hey, Shelly number two.

25:00.032 --> 25:02.672
- She'll do.
- OK.

25:03.902 --> 25:05.904
Is that a...

25:08.107 --> 25:09.085
Ad?

25:11.443 --> 25:12.615
Yes, it is.

25:12.711 --> 25:14.384
OK.

25:15.881 --> 25:17.952
Look! Wienerschnitzel!

25:21.887 --> 25:25.926
OK, everybody! From the top!
And a five, six, seven, eight!

25:26.025 --> 25:27.766
Go to the store
and buy some more

25:27.860 --> 25:29.737
Ninety-nine hotdogs
and buns on the wall

25:29.828 --> 25:33.037
So, you're saying this race
is bigger than the Nationals?

25:33.132 --> 25:38.047
Oh, yes. Very much so. But it
can also be very intimidating.

25:38.137 --> 25:43.780
Eight races, with eight dogs in
each, all competing for top dog.

25:44.543 --> 25:45.920
Wiener of the World!

25:46.011 --> 25:47.285
Wow.

25:47.880 --> 25:52.124
Sixty-four countries?
That is a bit intimidating.

25:52.217 --> 25:56.893
Yes, well for some.
But not for Shelly.

25:56.989 --> 25:59.401
'Cause she's a natural, she is.

26:05.330 --> 26:08.004
I didn't even know
there vvere that many countries.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.046
Oh, there are quite a lot
more than that,

26:10.135 --> 26:12.979
but some of them don't have
enough Wiener dogs to compete.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.644
So, who are we up against first?

26:16.742 --> 26:19.518
Well, that will all be determined
tomorrow when vve arrive.

26:19.611 --> 26:21.215
It's all done randomly.

26:21.313 --> 26:24.385
Let's say a prayer you're not
stuck with mean Russia.

26:24.483 --> 26:26.759
That little mutt
is favored to win.

26:26.852 --> 26:30.197
Hey! Watch What you say
in front of Shelly!

26:30.289 --> 26:32.360
Oh, oh. Sorry, Shelly!

26:40.165 --> 26:41.235
Delicious!

26:49.575 --> 26:53.216
Hand me my vintage
gold embossed, Teflon coated,

26:53.312 --> 26:57.954
chiffon buffed, hot pink,
tire deflator, please.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.583
Whoo, I'm back!
Are the kids back yet?

27:20.672 --> 27:25.246
Yeah... Danny's upstairs.

27:25.344 --> 27:26.652
He's not feeling vvell...

27:26.745 --> 27:29.248
- Is this Shelly? Hi!
- Yeah.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.259
Yeah, that's... that's Shelly.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.762
You shoulcfve heard your Dad talk about
you guys winning the Nationals.

27:33.852 --> 27:35.354
He was so proud.

27:35.454 --> 27:36.762
Yeah, well, he has a funny Way
of showing it.

27:36.855 --> 27:38.528
Well, it's his Way of showing it.

27:38.624 --> 27:41.127
Yeah, so just don't touch her
birthmark, that vvhole side.

27:41.226 --> 27:45.072
- She got hurt in the last race. So...
- Oh, OK. Hi!

27:47.833 --> 27:50.609
- That's Weird.
- No, no. That's not Weird.

27:50.702 --> 27:54.013
I mean, she just doesn't
like new people. <i>So...</i>

27:54.106 --> 27:55.676
Well, she's hoppin' around OK.

27:55.774 --> 27:57.185
Get the kids out here! Where are they?

27:57.276 --> 27:59.381
Yeah, yeah. Well,
I mean Danny he's...

27:59.478 --> 28:01.048
...he's upstairs, like I said...

28:01.146 --> 28:02.420
And Bridget?

28:06.018 --> 28:07.361
Hello.

28:12.524 --> 28:15.061
Oh, WOW.

28:16.461 --> 28:18.338
Is that really you, Bridget?

28:18.430 --> 28:19.738
Of course that's her! Yeah.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.670
Course it is.

28:24.269 --> 28:27.148
Yeah, just you look so grown up.

28:27.239 --> 28:28.616
Come here!
Give your aunt a hug!

28:35.547 --> 28:36.719
What's that?

28:36.815 --> 28:38.351
You're supposed to be
the warm one.

28:43.655 --> 28:45.931
- Remember our secret handshake?
- Secret handshake?

28:46.024 --> 28:47.332
Yeah.

28:58.604 --> 29:01.107
Oh, well... well,
it's been a while.

29:02.140 --> 29:04.780
You guys hungry?
Let's eat! Yeah?

29:06.878 --> 29:10.291
- So, you did good.
- I need to get home soon.

29:10.382 --> 29:11.861
Can you please just
stay for dinner?

29:11.950 --> 29:13.156
I mean, she'll be
outta here in no time.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.994
That means I'm going to
have to eat dinner twice?

29:16.088 --> 29:17.726
Well, you'll deal.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.905
- That was good.
- Nothing beats a good Wiener!

29:30.435 --> 29:31.505
Oh, no!

29:31.603 --> 29:33.844
No, no, no.
NO, no, no, no, no!

29:33.939 --> 29:36.112
- This... this will not do!
- What is it?

29:37.342 --> 29:39.344
Someone let the air
out of our tire.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.287
Or we have a big hole.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.826
Did vve run over anything
sharp on the Way here?

29:43.915 --> 29:45.519
I didn't hear anything.

29:45.617 --> 29:46.857
Me neither.

29:46.952 --> 29:49.193
I hope this doesn't make us
late for the Internationals.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.995
Hey, look!

30:00.966 --> 30:02.206
Let me see.

30:06.071 --> 30:07.573
Looks like dog hair.

30:12.144 --> 30:16.320
Very suspicious.
Proceed with caution!

30:26.224 --> 30:27.931
So, What's been new
with you, Bridget?

30:33.865 --> 30:35.401
Bridget!

30:35.500 --> 30:38.379
Oh... new with me...

30:38.470 --> 30:42.213
- That's a tough one, because--
- Because?

30:42.307 --> 30:45.516
Because... there are so many
new things about me.

30:45.610 --> 30:48.113
Oh, I bet. You are at a fun age.

30:48.213 --> 30:50.659
Not sure if furfs
the right vvord.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.458
You knovv,
I'm gonna go check on Danny.

30:53.552 --> 30:54.690
No!

30:56.054 --> 30:58.694
I mean, he's sleeping. So...

30:58.790 --> 31:01.100
I... I... I just wanna peek.
I'll be quiet, don't worry!

31:05.697 --> 31:06.971
Go stop her!

31:07.065 --> 31:10.512
You're not paying me enough
to get that involved.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.449
I like the real Bridget better.

31:22.147 --> 31:24.559
Hey, Danny.

31:24.649 --> 31:27.493
It's me. Aunt Jenny.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.759
I just wanna look at you, OK?

31:37.028 --> 31:39.907
I took his temperature before
you got back, so...

31:39.998 --> 31:42.410
Oh, hovv bad was it?

31:43.068 --> 31:44.945
- One-oh-eight?
- What?

31:45.036 --> 31:48.074
- I mean, 98. Ninety-eight.
- That's not that bad.

31:48.173 --> 31:50.449
No, I mean it seems like
the sleep's helping. So...

31:50.542 --> 31:54.513
Yeah. He's... so quiet.

31:55.881 --> 31:58.589
It's...
it's like he's not breathing.

32:00.752 --> 32:04.996
Yeah... He lost his voice.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.366
Really? Your Dad said
hejust spoke with him.

32:07.459 --> 32:13.341
Well, you know how colds are. They're,
uh, here one minute, gone the next.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.969
Well, at least he has his dog.

32:17.736 --> 32:19.272
You can tell they're close.

32:20.806 --> 32:22.945
Yeah, very close.

32:32.050 --> 32:35.395
We should probably leave him alone.

32:35.487 --> 32:36.727
Yeah.

32:38.223 --> 32:40.760
His hair is so soft.

32:40.859 --> 32:42.805
What kind of shampoo does he use?

32:45.163 --> 32:46.506
Doggie shampoo.

32:51.102 --> 32:52.513
OK.

32:57.609 --> 32:59.555
It seems to be holding
the air just fine.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.783
My guess is somebody
deflated your tires.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.621
Coulda been some bored kids.

33:03.715 --> 33:06.787
Or it could be
somebody with an agenda.

33:06.885 --> 33:08.159
That's a little dramatic.

33:08.253 --> 33:10.358
Who would wanna stop a couple
of kids on their Way to a race?

33:10.455 --> 33:14.198
- I can think of someone.
- Me too.

33:14.292 --> 33:15.566
Me three.

33:18.063 --> 33:21.442
Wow. This place is nice.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.440
Novv, kids.
You are right upstairs.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.710
I'm dovvn the hall
if you need anything.

33:27.806 --> 33:31.276
Novv, do not charge
anything to the room.

33:32.944 --> 33:34.321
We'll be good.

34:03.174 --> 34:04.346
What is it, girl?

34:29.434 --> 34:31.175
Alright, kid. Alright.

34:31.268 --> 34:33.306
Let's just keep this
our little secret, OK?

34:36.741 --> 34:39.221
- Judge Brown! It's Ms. Merryvveather!
- Stop the rackets!

34:41.179 --> 34:43.784
Mrs. Merryvveather!

34:43.882 --> 34:46.590
This is not What it looks like.

34:52.489 --> 34:54.094
It's a match.

34:54.192 --> 34:57.366
Alright, fine.
It's exactly What it looks like.

34:57.462 --> 34:59.169
But can you blame me, honestly?

34:59.264 --> 35:02.404
I mean, I should be the one
at the Internationals. Not you!

35:02.500 --> 35:04.446
We vvon the Nationals
fair and square!

35:04.536 --> 35:06.880
It's not our fault
that you cheated!

35:07.806 --> 35:09.717
Cheating is such a harsh vvord.

35:09.808 --> 35:13.346
I prefer to think of it as...
creating an advantage.

35:13.445 --> 35:14.446
And What do you call this?

35:14.546 --> 35:16.924
Oh, I call this creating
a very big advantage.

35:17.015 --> 35:22.465
Oh, Mrs. Merryvveather. For three
long years I stood by your side,

35:22.554 --> 35:26.229
promoted you with this Wonderful
wide world of Wiener dog racing.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.104
But no more.

35:29.194 --> 35:32.539
Yes. I can see whose side
you're standing on now.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.577
Well, fine.

35:34.666 --> 35:37.476
You caught me trying
to damage your vehicle.

35:37.569 --> 35:40.277
Fair enough. Well played.

35:40.372 --> 35:43.910
However, the Internationals
are a public event.

35:44.009 --> 35:49.982
And I assure you, I will be there
with more allies than enemies.

35:50.081 --> 35:52.755
You don't scare us.
We've got Shelly.

35:55.320 --> 35:58.494
Yes. For now.

35:59.524 --> 36:01.128
What do you mean?

36:08.500 --> 36:10.741
Hey, well, uh, thank you
for coming, Aunt Jenny.

36:10.835 --> 36:13.406
It was so nice to see you.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.781
Yeah, you too!
Sorry I had to be so quick.

36:15.874 --> 36:16.875
Quick like a bunny!

36:17.609 --> 36:18.849
Gosh, I do love bunnies.

36:18.943 --> 36:21.014
Yes, it was really
great meeting you.

36:22.514 --> 36:26.690
I mean, meeting you here.
At the house.

36:28.253 --> 36:30.130
Well, hopefully I'll be able
to come out here again soon.

36:30.221 --> 36:32.599
I feel like I hardly
recognize you two anymore.

36:32.857 --> 36:35.133
- Yeah.
- I know the feeling.

36:38.997 --> 36:42.740
- Can I go home now?
- Yeah, sure.

36:42.834 --> 36:46.907
- Your family is so Weird.
- I know.

37:04.756 --> 37:06.633
What?

37:15.066 --> 37:17.137
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

37:17.235 --> 37:19.442
- Excuse me?
- Whafre you doing with Bridget?

37:19.537 --> 37:21.073
Who's Bridget?

37:26.978 --> 37:29.549
Hey, Aunt Jenny!

37:30.415 --> 37:31.894
I see that you found Bridget...

37:32.784 --> 37:34.525
...and the neighbor lady.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.529
This isn't Bridget, Skip.

37:37.622 --> 37:41.229
And I'm guessing Danny's not
sick, either. What's going on?

37:42.594 --> 37:43.629
Yeah.

37:46.264 --> 37:50.178
Skip's the best older brother
a little kid could ask for.

37:51.336 --> 37:53.213
What did you do with the kids?

37:58.209 --> 37:59.620
- OK.
- I can't believe he did that.

37:59.711 --> 38:02.487
I understand Phil. Bye.

38:04.048 --> 38:05.618
I just spoke to your dad.

38:05.717 --> 38:07.788
He's furious about What you did.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.229
He was just hours away
from proposing

38:09.320 --> 38:11.630
and now he's hopping on a plane
to California instead.

38:11.723 --> 38:14.966
Danny and Bridget gave me
puppy dog eyes.

38:16.161 --> 38:18.163
I'm not good with puppy dog eyes.

38:18.263 --> 38:20.937
He said you need to take
responsibility and clean up your mess.

38:21.032 --> 38:24.502
- You're gonna go meet him there.
- I'm going to California? l-low'?

38:24.602 --> 38:26.673
In a car
that barely even starts?

38:26.771 --> 38:28.682
It's good enough
to get you to the airport.

38:28.773 --> 38:30.150
OK... now grab Shelly.

38:30.241 --> 38:31.652
You're gonna be
takin' her with you.

38:32.510 --> 38:34.251
What? What is it now?

38:35.313 --> 38:36.291
Nothin'.

38:36.781 --> 38:39.022
Yeah, yeah... nothin'.
Nothing at all.

38:39.117 --> 38:41.461
Nothing at all.
Come on, Shelly.

38:52.597 --> 38:54.474
Shelly!

38:58.102 --> 38:59.479
This is exciting.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.087
So, where are we going now'?

39:23.661 --> 39:25.163
You smell that?

39:26.331 --> 39:30.473
- I smell greasy food.
- And dirty laundry.

39:30.568 --> 39:34.175
No, no, no, no, under that.
The undercurrent.

39:35.106 --> 39:37.484
That is the smell of the race.

39:37.575 --> 39:41.318
Nope. Still gettin' dirty laundry.

39:41.412 --> 39:44.222
Me too. And dog.

39:44.315 --> 39:46.693
Alright, let's just get you
checked into your dorms, OK?

39:46.784 --> 39:48.559
- We get our own rooms'?
- Well, sort of.

39:48.653 --> 39:51.156
Each racing team gets to bunk
with another racing team.

39:51.256 --> 39:53.862
- So you get half of a room.
- Is that the real Shelly?

39:54.826 --> 39:56.237
Yes.

39:56.394 --> 39:59.603
Victory, victory!
That's our cry. V-l-C-T-O-R-Y!

39:59.697 --> 40:01.233
Yay, Shelly!

40:05.770 --> 40:08.250
- Can I pet her?
- Sure.

40:10.041 --> 40:12.180
This is my dog, Pretzel.

40:13.278 --> 40:15.258
Avvvv, this is gonna be fun.

40:17.148 --> 40:18.684
Watch it, termites.

40:18.783 --> 40:20.091
Or I will crush you.

40:20.184 --> 40:23.688
I will crush you, like something
that crushes with a crunch.

40:24.389 --> 40:25.367
Excuse me.

40:26.591 --> 40:29.003
That's the Russian
I was telling you about.

40:29.093 --> 40:31.539
Let's hope
she's not your roommate.

40:31.629 --> 40:34.576
She's even scarier than on TV.

40:34.666 --> 40:35.770
Definitely.

40:35.867 --> 40:38.677
Well, soon we will have to part ways,

40:38.770 --> 40:42.843
as I step foot onto sacred
ground, which is the racetrack,

40:42.941 --> 40:44.443
I will have to look out,

40:44.542 --> 40:47.819
not just for you,
but for all the other racers equally.

40:47.912 --> 40:50.483
So, I guess now it is...

40:50.782 --> 40:52.728
...time for a... hug.

40:52.817 --> 40:55.559
- Thank you for bringing us here.
- You're the best.

40:56.454 --> 40:57.558
OK, that's enough.

40:57.655 --> 40:58.633
Alright, I will call your father

40:58.723 --> 40:59.929
and let him know that
you've arrived safely.

41:00.024 --> 41:03.028
That's OK. We'll do it
from the dorm room.

41:03.127 --> 41:04.834
OK. Well, suit yourselves.

41:04.929 --> 41:08.035
I vvill see you and you,
at the race.

41:08.933 --> 41:11.277
This is gonna be fun! Come on!

41:20.545 --> 41:23.219
How're vve supposed to find out
which room is ours?

41:24.382 --> 41:25.918
Did you two need some help?

41:26.017 --> 41:29.226
I think so. We're pretty lost.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.731
You're the Jack family, correct?

41:30.822 --> 41:31.892
Hovv do you know?

41:32.223 --> 41:34.396
Your race last year was very famous.

41:35.593 --> 41:37.129
As far as Wiener dog races go.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.105
It was all over Japan.

41:39.197 --> 41:43.043
You're the Japanese racer?
Yoshi, right?

41:43.134 --> 41:46.604
I'm Etsuko.
My sister is Ayameko. Our dog is Yoshi.

41:46.704 --> 41:50.914
It's more her thing than mine,
but, yes, we represent Japan.

41:51.009 --> 41:54.616
So, hovv do vve find out
Where We're staying?

41:54.712 --> 41:55.986
First time here?

41:56.781 --> 41:59.227
Well, there's a very long line

41:59.317 --> 42:03.788
around the corner but lucky for you,
you don't have to stand in it.

42:03.888 --> 42:06.528
- Why not?
- Cause you're bunking with us!

42:06.624 --> 42:10.162
- I like you!
- I like you, too!

42:11.362 --> 42:12.432
I know we may be enemies

42:12.530 --> 42:14.134
if we both make it into
the final race,

42:14.232 --> 42:16.678
but until then
you'll Want to stick with us.

42:16.768 --> 42:18.839
These races can be brutal.

42:31.082 --> 42:34.188
Look who I found
Wandering the halls.

42:36.721 --> 42:38.962
Shelly Jack and the kids.

42:39.057 --> 42:42.163
- I'm Danny.
- And I'm Bridget.

42:42.260 --> 42:44.706
Yes, yes, of course,
I know who you are.

42:45.730 --> 42:47.175
And this is Shelly.

42:47.265 --> 42:49.108
My goodness, she's standing
right there in front of me.

42:49.200 --> 42:52.477
I am so excited,
I could just squeeze her.

42:53.871 --> 42:55.851
I Won't really squeeze her.

42:55.940 --> 42:59.615
I was just stepping forward to
take a look at her birthmark.

42:59.710 --> 43:01.986
The famous lightning bolt.

43:03.014 --> 43:05.551
Yes. The mark of a champion.

43:05.650 --> 43:07.254
You should take a look at Yoshi.

43:10.288 --> 43:12.700
- Is that--
- It's a bird.

43:12.790 --> 43:17.205
Birthmark of agility,
grace and high aspirations.

43:17.295 --> 43:21.038
Never seen another dog with a birthmark
in the exact same spot as Shelly's.

43:21.132 --> 43:23.635
Oh, keep your eyes peeled here.
There are several.

43:23.734 --> 43:26.214
Seems to be a universal
mark of a winner.

43:27.371 --> 43:30.511
It's kinda weird
that there'd be so many.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.645
Don't vvorry your
pretty little head about it.

43:33.411 --> 43:34.481
Come on, Bridge.

43:34.579 --> 43:36.490
You can leave Shelly here
with me if you'd like.

43:36.581 --> 43:40.290
No, that's OK. I Wanted to see
Where she's racing tomorrow.

43:40.384 --> 43:43.126
Visualize the win'?
Is that your tactic?

43:44.722 --> 43:45.792
No.

43:45.890 --> 43:50.964
We don't visualize anything.
Win or lose, vve do it together.

43:51.062 --> 43:52.837
That's very Zen.

43:53.831 --> 43:56.277
What does Zen mean?

43:56.367 --> 43:58.711
I don't know.
It's a Japanese vvord.

43:58.803 --> 44:03.149
I think it means like, like you know...
humble or something.

44:03.241 --> 44:04.549
I really don't know.

44:12.683 --> 44:14.185
Is that Ms. Merryvveather?

44:20.391 --> 44:21.927
Give me a second.

44:24.328 --> 44:26.831
She wants us to dognap Shelly.

44:26.931 --> 44:28.604
I don't know about that.

44:28.699 --> 44:33.478
That wasn't a question.
If Mrs. M says jump, you jump.

44:41.045 --> 44:42.820
She was kinda Weird.

44:44.048 --> 44:46.619
Yeah. The other one
seemed nice though.

44:46.717 --> 44:49.027
I wonder now Skip's
doing with Aunt Jenny.

44:49.120 --> 44:51.464
I'm sure
he's got it under control.

45:10.074 --> 45:11.246
Wow.

45:11.342 --> 45:13.185
I thought it was gonna
be bigger than last time.

45:13.277 --> 45:16.724
It is bigger. It's televised
all over the World.

45:22.887 --> 45:23.888
Come on!

45:28.726 --> 45:30.728
We'll be starting about here...

45:30.828 --> 45:32.899
And ending over there.

45:32.997 --> 45:34.499
Wanna give it a try?

45:36.200 --> 45:38.009
I think that's a yes.

45:40.705 --> 45:41.683
OK!

45:43.374 --> 45:44.352
Ready?

45:45.376 --> 45:48.380
- Come on. Come on!
- Go!

45:50.548 --> 45:51.652
Yes!

45:53.951 --> 45:55.828
Go get them and bring 'em
back to the car.

45:55.920 --> 45:57.797
You're not racing.
Not after What you did.

45:57.888 --> 46:01.927
- Dad, I'm so, so-
- Not now. Go.

46:02.026 --> 46:04.768
OK, I'll go find them.

46:04.862 --> 46:07.468
Hopefully, this time
around she gets a fair race.

46:07.565 --> 46:09.545
There's no Merryvveather, at least.

46:09.634 --> 46:12.308
- Well, that's not very nice.
- Ms. Merryvveather!

46:12.403 --> 46:14.940
Yes. What kind of dog race
would it be Without us?

46:15.039 --> 46:17.849
- A fair race.
- Oh. That's mean.

46:17.942 --> 46:20.183
Hovv about
a smile for an old friend?

46:20.278 --> 46:21.985
We're not old friends.

46:22.079 --> 46:26.255
There you go, sweetie. Girl,
you better watch that attitude.

46:26.350 --> 46:29.661
You're gonna wind up
not that different from me.

46:29.754 --> 46:33.065
- What do you Want?
- Well, with you? Nothing, actually.

46:33.157 --> 46:36.604
I mean I admit, I did try to prevent you
from getting here earlier,

46:36.694 --> 46:41.507
but now that I see you on the track...
well, I just saw her run.

46:41.599 --> 46:45.706
Timed her, actually.
Sixteen miles per hour.

46:45.803 --> 46:48.409
She is never gonna win
if that's the best she's got.

46:48.506 --> 46:51.510
- She can do better.
- I hope you're right.

46:51.609 --> 46:54.021
Actually, I don't hope you're right.

46:54.111 --> 46:56.819
That's just an expression.
I hope you're wrong.

46:56.914 --> 46:58.689
Why are you here
if you can't race?

46:58.783 --> 47:01.286
Did you know
this event is televised?

47:01.385 --> 47:04.264
One hundred and twenty
million viewers worldwide.

47:04.355 --> 47:06.232
That's more than the Super Bowl.

47:06.324 --> 47:07.632
Well, give or take a hundred million.

47:07.725 --> 47:08.703
Why are you here?

47:08.793 --> 47:11.467
Besides the chance at eternal fame...

47:11.562 --> 47:14.304
Well, let's just say
I may have some investments.

47:14.398 --> 47:15.502
Investments?

47:15.599 --> 47:19.103
Merryvveather Industries is the major
sponsor of the event this year.

47:19.203 --> 47:22.184
- Along with other involvements.
- You own a company?

47:22.273 --> 47:24.776
It's called a conglomerate, actually.

47:24.875 --> 47:27.151
We have subsidiaries all over the World.

47:27.244 --> 47:30.453
I mean you didn't really think I made
my fortune racing vvieners, did you?

47:30.548 --> 47:32.357
- Well, kinda.
- Yeah.

47:32.483 --> 47:34.588
Children. So simple.

47:38.122 --> 47:39.795
Come on, Danny. Let's head back.

47:39.890 --> 47:41.494
They'll be announcing
the racing brackets soon.

47:41.592 --> 47:43.128
Yes, yes.
Take care of yourselves.

47:43.227 --> 47:46.902
We wouldn't vvant anything
to happen between now and the race.

47:46.997 --> 47:49.910
You go along
and take care of yourself.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.504
Maybe I'll just
stay here and warm up Princess.

47:54.472 --> 47:55.815
Just in case.

47:55.906 --> 47:57.510
Come on, Bridget!

47:58.409 --> 48:00.184
Come on, Shelly!

48:07.451 --> 48:09.192
Looks like we can
put off racing Russia.

48:09.286 --> 48:12.460
At least until they win their
bracket ancl we win ours.

48:13.791 --> 48:18.171
Let's see. US, USA, US...

48:18.262 --> 48:22.768
us, USA, us, USA, us, USA.

48:25.536 --> 48:27.345
Looks like We're goin' last.

48:27.872 --> 48:30.318
That's What you save the best for.

48:31.876 --> 48:33.480
Come on, Shelly!

48:39.817 --> 48:41.990
Judge Brown! Judge Brown!

48:42.086 --> 48:45.295
Skip! What are you doing here?

48:45.389 --> 48:48.029
Oh. First I wanna apologize.

48:48.125 --> 48:49.763
I'm really sorry for What I did.

48:49.860 --> 48:53.364
- What did you do?
- Oh, you don't know yet.

48:53.464 --> 48:55.444
Great, never mind. It's nothing.

48:55.533 --> 48:57.069
Where are my brother and sister?

48:57.168 --> 48:59.614
Oh, oh they're in the dorms.
Room eight.

48:59.703 --> 49:01.842
But, what...
What are you doing with Shelly?

49:01.939 --> 49:03.009
OK. Thanks. Bye.

49:03.874 --> 49:06.718
Wait, Skip!
What did you do?

49:06.811 --> 49:08.256
Oh, this can't be good.

49:08.345 --> 49:11.019
Oh, heavens to vvieners.
This cannot be good.

49:11.615 --> 49:13.959
It's wrong.
Don't you feel bad?

49:14.051 --> 49:15.758
I don't care how it feels.

49:15.853 --> 49:17.890
I'm paying you,
and you do What you're paid for.

49:17.988 --> 49:21.959
Oh. I'm looking for
my brother and sister.

49:22.059 --> 49:24.835
Danny and Bridget?

49:24.929 --> 49:27.603
Yeah. That's them.

49:28.199 --> 49:29.940
Yes, they Went
to see the racetrack,

49:30.034 --> 49:32.071
but they're in here
with my sister tonight.

49:32.169 --> 49:34.080
- Oh.
- We're from Japan.

49:34.171 --> 49:36.674
- Nice. That's cool.
- Hello.

49:36.774 --> 49:37.752
Hi.

49:37.842 --> 49:39.685
Sorry about the melodrama,

49:39.777 --> 49:44.089
but... We're rehearsing for a play.

49:44.181 --> 49:47.094
Huh. "Best Friends."

49:48.385 --> 49:50.592
Seems like the name needs
a little bit of work.

49:50.688 --> 49:52.429
But... seems cool.

49:56.427 --> 49:59.203
You excited for the race?

49:59.296 --> 50:01.833
Yeah, vvell, that's...
more of my brother and sister's thing.

50:01.932 --> 50:04.845
- Mine too.
- Is that really Shelly?

50:04.935 --> 50:06.380
The one and only.

50:08.239 --> 50:10.617
Hovv come you have Shelly if you haven't
found your brother and sister yet?

50:10.708 --> 50:13.086
Yeah, that's kind of
a weird story.

50:13.611 --> 50:14.851
I got a few of those.

50:16.146 --> 50:17.853
Actually, I had a question for you.

50:17.948 --> 50:20.792
Could you possibly watch Shelly,
While I go look for the kids?

50:20.885 --> 50:22.762
Oh, I don't know.

50:22.853 --> 50:24.924
Oh, I mean, if you have somewhere
to be or somewhere to go--

50:25.022 --> 50:26.296
What are you talking about?

50:26.824 --> 50:28.667
It's fine.

50:28.759 --> 50:32.138
Awesome. Thank you. I'll be
back right after I find them.

50:32.229 --> 50:34.800
- OK.
- Thank you.

50:39.003 --> 50:43.418
He's cute, if you like that blonde hair,
blue-eyed kinda thing.

50:43.507 --> 50:45.384
Too bad we'll have to crush him.

50:45.476 --> 50:49.014
Oh, great.
You have a crush on him.

50:49.113 --> 50:50.615
No, I just met him.

50:50.714 --> 50:54.127
Right. So did l. But I can
still tell you like him.

50:54.218 --> 50:55.526
Keep it in check.

50:55.619 --> 50:58.429
Cause if he likes you back,
we might be able to use that.

51:01.392 --> 51:03.838
We're only keeping you
just through the race, OK?

51:03.928 --> 51:05.999
Then it's back to your family.

51:06.096 --> 51:08.167
Stop with the puppy dog
talk to the dog. OK?

51:08.265 --> 51:11.644
- Sorry.
- Just remember what I hired you to do.

51:11.735 --> 51:13.271
Of course.

51:13.370 --> 51:16.044
Quick thinking with the rehearsing
the script bit, by the way.

51:16.140 --> 51:17.813
I thought we were busted.

51:17.908 --> 51:20.684
You know What they say.
Save the best for last.

51:20.778 --> 51:22.689
And I think you're the best.

51:22.780 --> 51:24.919
Me too.

51:25.583 --> 51:26.755
Come on!

51:41.265 --> 51:43.973
Hey! We're back.

51:46.370 --> 51:48.316
Wait. You have Shelly?

51:50.240 --> 51:52.686
Of course we clo.
You saw us leave with her.

51:52.776 --> 51:56.121
- Yes, but...
- But, What?

51:56.780 --> 51:58.157
What is it?

51:58.248 --> 52:04.096
Nothing. lfsjust... always good
to see the one and only Shelly.

52:06.724 --> 52:10.137
Oh... They announced
the racing brackets.

52:10.227 --> 52:12.707
Did you girls see it?
You're in race number two.

52:12.796 --> 52:14.605
Will you stay here
While I go take a look?

52:14.698 --> 52:16.075
Yes, of course!

52:17.167 --> 52:19.044
Do What needs to be done.

52:27.678 --> 52:29.783
Your brother
was here looking for you.

52:30.848 --> 52:33.727
What? Skip's here!

52:33.817 --> 52:35.694
That means that Dad found out.

52:35.786 --> 52:37.857
This isn't good.
Where did he go?

52:37.955 --> 52:39.434
I think he's headed to the racetrack.

52:39.523 --> 52:42.367
We gotta go after him.
Can we leave Shelly here with you'?

52:42.459 --> 52:45.963
Yes, of course. I keep an eye
on her. Make sure she's safe.

52:46.897 --> 52:49.241
Thank you. Come on, Bridget.

52:49.333 --> 52:50.573
It's OK, girl.

52:55.673 --> 52:57.118
It's only for one day.

53:06.383 --> 53:10.456
Danny! Bridget! Shelly?

53:10.554 --> 53:13.091
Oh...
I think you just missed them.

53:13.190 --> 53:15.796
They were just here.
You must have crossed paths.

53:15.893 --> 53:18.203
I think they were heading back
to check the racing brackets.

53:18.295 --> 53:20.241
OK. Thanks.

53:20.330 --> 53:25.279
Oh, wait... before you go...
I have a quick question to ask.

53:25.369 --> 53:26.871
Yeah. Sure. What is it?

53:26.970 --> 53:30.474
Well, if it were just you...

53:30.574 --> 53:32.417
...what would you sell
that clog for'?

53:32.509 --> 53:35.922
OK, no matter how I answer
this Ms. Merryweather,

53:36.013 --> 53:38.721
it's not gonna change a thing
because it's not just me.

53:38.816 --> 53:42.263
- I know. But still...
- Skip! What's going on?

53:42.352 --> 53:44.457
Hey, you two!

53:47.858 --> 53:50.270
Yeah, OK. I'm sorry.
That was... that's really Weird.

53:50.994 --> 53:53.497
You miss us!

53:53.597 --> 53:55.668
Are we being kicked out of the race'?

53:55.766 --> 53:57.336
Wait, does Dad know that We're here?

53:57.434 --> 54:00.210
Yeah, he doesn't just know,
he actually...

54:00.738 --> 54:03.685
He flew out here to meet me,
and he's trying to take you two back.

54:03.774 --> 54:08.553
Wait, wait, wait! Your father
clicln't know that you came here'?

54:10.314 --> 54:13.784
Excuse me. I really must
start Warming Princess up.

54:18.789 --> 54:20.623
Two Shellys. One has got to be
real, and one fake.

54:20.624 --> 54:24.572
Two Shellys. One has got to be
real, and one fake.

54:24.661 --> 54:27.642
- But why'?
- One thing we learn in improv

54:27.731 --> 54:29.267
is to never question why.

54:30.667 --> 54:32.908
Just go with the flow.

54:33.003 --> 54:36.382
Occasionally you give
good advice. Hand me a tissue.

54:55.392 --> 54:56.894
Guess we know which one is real.

54:56.994 --> 54:58.803
We'll have to switch their collars.

55:26.356 --> 55:27.994
I don't wanna do this.

55:28.091 --> 55:30.162
Relax. It's just for the night.

55:30.260 --> 55:33.366
I don't know.
It doesn't feel right anymore.

55:33.463 --> 55:37.172
When you hired me to pretend to be
your sister, I thought it was more...

55:37.267 --> 55:39.247
- More What?
- More sisterly.

55:39.803 --> 55:41.043
I thought you were lonely

55:41.138 --> 55:43.311
or just Wanted someone
to Walk around with you on campus.

55:44.641 --> 55:47.053
Do I look lonely to you?

55:47.144 --> 55:52.958
I ovvn the fastest Wiener dog
in all of Japan, and soon, the World.

55:53.784 --> 55:57.732
- Everyone will wanna be my friend.
- That's not real friendship.

55:58.121 --> 55:59.930
Real friendship doesn't
cost you anything.

56:00.023 --> 56:02.128
Everything costs you something.

56:02.226 --> 56:06.936
Lunches, visits...
every friendship has a cost.

56:07.030 --> 56:09.032
Now go put her somewhere
quiet for the night.

56:09.566 --> 56:11.273
OK...

56:11.368 --> 56:13.974
But if I get any indication
that you might hurt her--

56:14.071 --> 56:16.745
What do I look like to you?
A monster?

56:16.840 --> 56:18.786
Why are you
so afraid of this dog?

56:18.876 --> 56:20.685
I'm not afraid.
It's just...

56:20.777 --> 56:23.690
She's got the drive,
the determination to win.

56:24.648 --> 56:26.127
Keep her out of sight.

56:36.994 --> 56:38.735
Hi, I'm looking for Bridget and Danny.

56:40.530 --> 56:42.100
Shelly?

56:45.168 --> 56:47.239
Come here, girl! Shelly!

56:48.005 --> 56:49.416
She never listens to me.

56:49.506 --> 56:51.884
Hi, hovv are ya?

56:57.414 --> 56:58.722
Come on.

57:00.183 --> 57:01.685
Good girl.

57:06.089 --> 57:07.432
Is that another dog?

57:08.725 --> 57:11.501
That's Yoshi. Our dog.

57:19.036 --> 57:20.344
Hi, Yoshi.

57:25.075 --> 57:29.148
Whoa! Well you put on
a few pounds, haven't ya'?

57:35.752 --> 57:36.730
Dad!

57:38.155 --> 57:40.795
I thought we were
meeting you at the oar.

57:40.891 --> 57:42.802
I'm really angry at you...

57:45.796 --> 57:47.400
And I'm glad you're OK.

57:52.669 --> 57:54.012
But being glad
that you're OK and OK

57:54.104 --> 57:55.481
with What you did
are two different things.

57:55.572 --> 57:57.643
We're really sorry, Dad.

57:59.109 --> 58:02.318
It's just...
this race means a lot to us.

58:03.814 --> 58:05.452
Can we just stay until tomorrow?

58:05.549 --> 58:08.291
I mean, we're...
We're already here.

58:08.385 --> 58:10.160
After What you did? No Way.

58:10.253 --> 58:13.666
- But--
- No buts. No What ifs.

58:13.757 --> 58:18.331
No pleases. I've got Shelly.
Meet me downstairs.

58:19.196 --> 58:21.073
But, Dad, What if...
Please!

58:23.433 --> 58:25.071
I'm sorry to see you go.

58:25.168 --> 58:28.513
I was really looking forward
to watching Shelly race.

58:28.605 --> 58:31.484
I'm sure she would have
surprised everyone.

58:35.145 --> 58:36.590
Come on, Bridget.

58:40.250 --> 58:43.129
So... Where's the other dog?

58:43.220 --> 58:45.723
She's safe with us.
I'll adopt her.

58:45.822 --> 58:49.929
You got the real Shelly back
and that's all that matters.

58:50.794 --> 58:53.001
OK. Well, thank you.

58:53.864 --> 58:55.673
- Skip!
- Yeah.

58:55.766 --> 58:57.746
I'm really sorry
how it worked out.

58:57.834 --> 59:01.179
I know that that
meant a lot to them.

59:01.271 --> 59:07.017
Well, it's kinda my fault.
I messed up. So... yeah.

59:08.979 --> 59:11.323
I was actually hoping... maybe...

59:12.349 --> 59:13.692
Yes?

59:15.385 --> 59:16.693
Never mind.

59:16.787 --> 59:18.528
I'm gonna be
leaving town anyways so...

59:18.622 --> 59:20.226
...doesn't really matter.

59:20.323 --> 59:23.793
- But...
- Where you going to ask me out?

59:23.894 --> 59:28.172
I don't know. I think so...

59:34.438 --> 59:37.851
Sweet. But he's gone now,
so do What I hired you for.

59:37.941 --> 59:40.182
Maybe we should
just give her back.

59:40.277 --> 59:41.654
I mean, they're not even
going to race her now.

59:41.745 --> 59:43.656
Are you mad?
This is high stakes.

59:43.747 --> 59:47.194
This is Internationals.
I'm not taking any chances.

59:47.284 --> 59:50.754
Now go put Shelly in a nice,
quiet place until after the race.

59:50.854 --> 59:54.097
Then she'll either go back
to the family or to the highest bidder.

59:54.191 --> 59:55.534
You said
you weren't going to hurt her.

59:55.625 --> 59:57.070
And I won't.

59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.471
Don't worry, the Jack family
still left with a clog.

01:00:00.564 --> 01:00:03.704
I doubt they'll know the
difference Without racing her.

01:00:18.582 --> 01:00:20.926
I can't believe you're
pulling us from the race.

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:24.055
You created the position you're in.
I told you to stay home.

01:00:24.154 --> 01:00:27.499
And miss the biggest opportunity
of me and Shelly's career?

01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:30.538
Career?
Are you kidding me? You're nine.

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:32.072
I'm ten, Dad.

01:00:32.162 --> 01:00:35.166
We're really sorry that you had
to fly all the way out here,

01:00:35.265 --> 01:00:37.711
but vve weren't in big trouble.
You could have just let us stay.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:40.509
We would've been home before you,
and it would have been fine and--

01:00:40.604 --> 01:00:41.878
I'm not discussing this anymore.

01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:44.051
Get to bed!

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:47.220
We're leaving in the morning.

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:55.555
I should probably mention something.

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:56.790
- What?
- Never mind.

01:00:56.887 --> 01:01:00.562
Yeah, Dad's right.
We should probably go to bed.

01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:02.963
Guys...

01:01:04.027 --> 01:01:05.631
Yeah.

01:01:08.698 --> 01:01:10.769
Her birthmarké leaking.

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:14.076
Yeah... lthinkl know
What's causing that.

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:15.844
You're not gonna like it though.

01:01:16.373 --> 01:01:17.613
Dad?

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:33.761
This is just for a little bit, OK?

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:41.036
I suppose we can't be friends
after all I'm putting you through.

01:01:47.971 --> 01:01:49.575
Oh, WOW.

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:54.884
Maybe we can. I'm sorry.

01:01:54.978 --> 01:01:57.117
You shouldn't be locked up in here.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:01:59.160
You should be out there racing.

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:14.665
I can't believe
you could make a fake Shelly.

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:17.301
OK, I'm sorry. It was only
supposed to be for a day.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.743
Yeah, well, Skip,
that's why it's necessary

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:20.508
to start thinking
further ahead than tomorrow.

01:02:21.037 --> 01:02:24.780
Skip! Really? l-low could you
leave Shelly behind like that'?

01:02:24.874 --> 01:02:26.785
Etsuko said she was the right dog.

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:30.016
You relied on the enemy for information?

01:02:30.113 --> 01:02:32.093
OK. Etsuko is not the enemy.

01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:35.925
Really? She lied to you
and stole our dog.

01:02:36.019 --> 01:02:39.057
You know, Skip, that's what
most people would call an enemy.

01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:40.361
Listen, that's enough, alright?

01:02:40.457 --> 01:02:41.834
We're gonna get Shelly,
and then We're gonna go.

01:02:41.925 --> 01:02:45.873
We're not racing. We got a plane
to catch in three hours. Let's go.

01:02:48.665 --> 01:02:50.303
- Listen to me...
- OK.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.904
If she has a scratch,
you get a scar.

01:02:56.806 --> 01:03:01.050
Oh! Have you thought of a name for this
little guy, besides Fake Shelly yet?

01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:04.250
Honestly, I haven't
thought that far ahead.

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:06.258
That's OK.
I'll think about it for you.

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:31.609
Hovv vve gonna find Shelly
with all these people and dogs around?

01:03:31.708 --> 01:03:35.121
That's easy. Follow the only
person who knows where she is.

01:03:48.458 --> 01:03:49.960
Where do you think she's going?

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.164
Let's find out.

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:06.877
What is this?

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:10.816
She was cold.

01:04:12.615 --> 01:04:14.253
She's our prisoner.

01:04:15.652 --> 01:04:18.098
You're not supposed to
cuddle with the prisoners.

01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:20.259
Well, I was cold, too.

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:22.462
Look. Ayameko,

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:24.197
I don't feel good
about this whole thing.

01:04:24.294 --> 01:04:25.864
She should race.

01:04:25.962 --> 01:04:28.943
You think I Went through all this
just to have a change of heart?

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:32.411
That's not hovv
the world works, Etsuko.

01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:35.073
Fine, well,
I'll just tell them myself.

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:36.980
Oh, I'cl be soared if they weren't

01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:39.849
already halfway
across the country by now.

01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:41.354
Remember our deal?

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:44.823
You go along with this and my sponsor
keeps paying for your college.

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:48.225
You stop and... bye, bye.

01:04:48.318 --> 01:04:50.059
Well, maybe that's
not such a bad thing.

01:04:50.153 --> 01:04:52.565
You know Wiener dog racing
is everything to me.

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:54.259
There's only a few people
on this planet

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:56.496
who understand
how badly I want this.

01:04:56.593 --> 01:05:00.837
Ms. Merryvveather, for example, and...
I can't think of anyone else.

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:02.136
You're crazy.

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:05.213
There's a fine line
between crazy and genius.

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:08.578
I like to think of that line as the
starting point to Wiener clog racing.

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:11.278
Let's go.

01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:12.944
Now let's get her
back in her cage.

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:16.683
We'll need to bring her to the races
so she can watch someone else win.

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:21.458
Come on.

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:28.835
Why did you take Shelly?

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:31.428
- It's not What it looks like.
- What is it then?

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:34.541
My real name is Cynthia.

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:39.436
I'm not even Japanese.
I'm half-Chinese, half-Vietnamese.

01:05:39.536 --> 01:05:41.140
I knew it!

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:47.115
OK, I didn't know it, know it,
but I knew something wasn't right.

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:49.952
Right. Why'd you take Shelly?

01:05:50.046 --> 01:05:52.583
Ayameko hired me
to pretend to be her guardian

01:05:52.682 --> 01:05:54.025
so she could enter the race alone.

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:57.326
- She has some kind of sponsor.
- Merryvveather.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:59.525
Once she saw that you
brought two clogs to the race,

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:01.898
she told me to take
the real Shelly and hide her.

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:04.631
We were going to return her
to you after the race.

01:06:04.727 --> 01:06:08.800
Why would you do that?
We weren't even going to race.

01:06:08.898 --> 01:06:12.471
I know. But Ayameko doesn't
leave anything to chance.

01:06:12.569 --> 01:06:15.914
That's What a race is all about.
Chance.

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:18.679
- Yeah.
- Not in her World.

01:06:18.775 --> 01:06:22.621
Look, I know it may not appear this way,
but this isn't me.

01:06:22.712 --> 01:06:23.952
This isn't who I am.

01:06:24.047 --> 01:06:26.220
You guys still have
the fake Shelly, right?

01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:28.318
Her name's Tricksy, now.

01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:30.929
She's with our dad.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:34.126
Well, hovv about vve let Tricksy
do What she does best?

01:06:42.632 --> 01:06:44.339
Judge Brown!

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:47.681
I need to speak to you.

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:50.979
Yeah, make it quick. I'm about
to go announce the races.

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:58.591
- What's that?
- Vocal exercises.

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:02.891
Oh. OK. So, we picked up
Shelly yesterday.

01:07:02.986 --> 01:07:05.296
At least,
we thought we clicl and--

01:07:05.388 --> 01:07:06.958
Yeah, you have to excuse me.
I... I... I...

01:07:07.056 --> 01:07:09.058
I'm about to Walk on to the stage.

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:13.107
The Shelly we picked up was a fake.

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:16.541
- A fake dog?
- No, no, no. A fake Shelly.

01:07:16.633 --> 01:07:19.876
What in the Wonderful world of vvienies
would you be doing with a fake Shelly?

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:21.846
- That's a long story.
- Well, I--

01:07:21.938 --> 01:07:24.919
The point is,
Ayameko dognapped Shelly.

01:07:25.008 --> 01:07:27.955
You mean Ayameko,
the champion from Japan?

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:32.356
Oh, Danny, Danny...
that's a very serious allegation.

01:07:32.448 --> 01:07:34.257
Accusing another racer of...

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:37.820
...of dognapping is a direct
violation of rule seven bu...

01:07:37.921 --> 01:07:40.231
Well, actually it's not seven
point it might be...

01:07:40.323 --> 01:07:42.166
I'm not su... Make a note.

01:07:42.258 --> 01:07:46.331
We need to add a rule about dognapping,
and dognapping allegation.

01:07:46.429 --> 01:07:50.172
- Yes, sir.
- Yes. Now, what is it you need'?

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:57.081
L-lave you noticed how a lot of the clogs
have similar... birthmarks to Shelly's'?

01:07:57.173 --> 01:08:01.679
Yes. They're calling it
the "mark of a champion" this year.

01:08:01.778 --> 01:08:03.917
Don't you find it a bit suspicious?

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:06.687
You mean, coincidental?

01:08:06.783 --> 01:08:09.354
No. I mean suspicious.

01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:12.658
We think Ms. Merryvveathefis behind it.

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:14.063
Ms. Merryvveather?

01:08:14.157 --> 01:08:17.331
What would Ms. Merryvveather
have to do with hundreds of dogs

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.566
having identical birthmark placement?

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:20.697
I mean...

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:27.444
Cloning.

01:08:27.537 --> 01:08:29.881
- That's ridiculous.
- It's not ridiculous.

01:08:29.973 --> 01:08:32.749
Merryvveather Industries is well
known in the scientific world

01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:34.446
for aggressive experiments.

01:08:34.544 --> 01:08:36.490
Yes, but there wouldn't--

01:08:36.578 --> 01:08:38.058
It just... Please look into it.

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:40.319
We made a list
of all the different countries

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:42.760
with dogs that have
birthmarks like Shelly's.

01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:45.924
Huh, well,
that's why I have an assistant.

01:08:46.022 --> 01:08:48.194
Now, you understand
it's too late for us

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:50.100
to do anything about
this before the race today.

01:08:50.193 --> 01:08:51.569
Of course.

01:08:51.661 --> 01:08:55.073
Also, I need to knovv, who will be
representing the United States?

01:08:55.163 --> 01:08:59.635
Will it be Ms. Merryvveather
or the Jack family?

01:08:59.736 --> 01:09:01.010
I believe we will, sir.

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:03.243
There's just one more thing
vve have to do.

01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:06.979
Well, you do understand that
by the time I announce the race,

01:09:07.076 --> 01:09:09.578
you must be seated
underneath the US flag

01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:12.716
or Mrs. Merryvveather
will race in your place.

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:14.624
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

01:09:15.718 --> 01:09:16.924
Judge Brown?

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:19.091
- Yes.
- I owe you.

01:09:19.188 --> 01:09:20.724
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no.

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:23.599
NO, no, no, no, no.
NO, no, no, no, no.

01:09:23.693 --> 01:09:27.334
Owing me, well, that would be
in direct violation of rule 2.9.

01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:30.540
If a dog chews shoes,
What shoes would he chew?

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:31.805
Rules.

01:09:31.901 --> 01:09:33.608
If a dog chews shoes,
What shoes would he chew?

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:36.606
If a dog chews shoes,
What shoes would he chew?

01:09:36.706 --> 01:09:39.050
If a dog chews shoes...

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.053
It brings me great excitement

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:49.687
to kick off the 13th annual
Wiener Dog Internationals.

01:09:49.786 --> 01:09:51.959
Televised in over 100 countries.

01:09:52.055 --> 01:09:54.797
Viewed by over 20 million people.

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:57.770
It's the biggest
Wiener dog event of the year!

01:09:59.295 --> 01:10:04.005
Thank you! Thank you! As some of you
may knovv, I was recently asked

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:07.775
to take over as head judge
for this esteemed organization,

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:11.317
after sewing for 15 years
for the US Nationals,

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:17.085
and I am excited to be pan of
this international legacy.

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.684
And now to kick us off,
open your ears and listen

01:10:20.783 --> 01:10:26.392
to the wonderful recording by Barking
Tempo of the Internationals theme song.

01:10:34.964 --> 01:10:38.343
- Hello, Jack family.
- You don't scare us.

01:10:38.434 --> 01:10:41.005
Oh, good. I just Wanted to wish
you luck on the race today.

01:10:41.104 --> 01:10:43.516
- Really?
- No! Not really.

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:45.051
- Oh.
- That was sarcasm.

01:10:45.508 --> 01:10:49.615
Sarcasm.
Something my protégé excels at.

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:50.782
Merryvveather.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.292
Why the glum face?

01:10:53.382 --> 01:10:56.090
I mean, it's just a race, right'?

01:10:56.185 --> 01:10:58.825
- Not like anyone has to get hurt.
- Right.

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:00.867
Oh, and I see you
brought Shelly.

01:11:00.957 --> 01:11:04.234
I guess that means I'll be
sitting on the sidelines, huh?

01:11:04.327 --> 01:11:05.362
That's Where you belong.

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:08.032
Let's just hope
she lives up to her reputation.

01:11:08.131 --> 01:11:10.372
I wouldn't Want her
to feel she didn't belong.

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:13.447
Yes, I'm sure
that would really devastate you.

01:11:14.203 --> 01:11:15.580
Have a nice race.

01:11:15.671 --> 01:11:17.014
You know, for someone
who has so much money,

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.551
you sure do blow a lot of it
picking on kids.

01:11:18.641 --> 01:11:20.348
Oh, thanks for noticing.

01:11:21.077 --> 01:11:22.055
Let's go!

01:11:26.249 --> 01:11:27.660
She knows this Shelly's a fake.

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:29.525
But she doesn't know that we know.

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:34.864
Ladies and Gentlemen, with 64
countries present here today,

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:38.632
it is a verifiable
War of the Wieners.

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:42.101
Now, today you'll witness
eight races,

01:11:42.198 --> 01:11:44.235
with eight dogs in each race.

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:48.213
The Winner of each race will
advance to the final showdown.

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:52.184
Let's Welcome the racers from
our first eight countries!

01:11:53.676 --> 01:11:56.850
Canada, Australia,

01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.719
United Arab Emirates,

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:03.354
France, Switzerland,

01:12:03.452 --> 01:12:09.562
Sweden, Venezuela and... Russia!

01:12:12.261 --> 01:12:15.140
She's Warming up herself
not the dog, but why...

01:12:15.231 --> 01:12:16.733
Why would you be doing that?

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:18.904
Just focus on What We're here for.
We're here to get Shelly.

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:20.541
Alright.

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:23.583
And now, the moment
vve have all been Waiting for.

01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:27.246
The moment some of us have traveled
halfway around the world for.

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:31.257
Ladies and gentlemen,
start your vvieners!

01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:47.637
I don't believe it.

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:51.701
Russia has been
defeated in the first race.

01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:57.046
Thought to be a favorite, well it
turns out that Clementine from France

01:12:57.139 --> 01:13:01.679
has snatched sweet victory right from
the claws of oppressive Mother Russia.

01:13:02.912 --> 01:13:05.859
Unpredictability
is one of the many qualities

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:09.225
that makes Wiener Dog racing one of
the most beloved sports around.

01:13:10.086 --> 01:13:13.033
I guess you don't know What
to expect in a race like this.

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:14.430
I hope so.

01:13:15.758 --> 01:13:17.999
Go to Etsuko.

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:19.198
Go!

01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:23.704
Go that Way. That way!

01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:25.369
No, to the right! Other right.

01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:30.582
That way, that way! Yeah!

01:13:33.042 --> 01:13:35.022
Not the hotdog!

01:13:35.111 --> 01:13:36.647
It's unedible.

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:38.851
That Way. Yes. Good.

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:41.188
Bye, Tricksy!

01:13:41.284 --> 01:13:43.958
We're up. This is it.

01:13:44.053 --> 01:13:46.863
- Good luck out there.
- I don't need luck.

01:13:46.956 --> 01:13:50.165
Make sure the Jack family
doesn't get near that dog carrier.

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:52.136
You got it.

01:13:54.297 --> 01:13:55.469
Hey, Tricksy.

01:14:09.745 --> 01:14:10.985
Go to Danny!

01:14:14.984 --> 01:14:16.930
Shelly!

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:19.966
Two-four-six-eight!
Who do vve appreciate?

01:14:20.056 --> 01:14:23.196
Shelly! Shelly!
Yay, Shelly!

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:25.670
We're being Watched.

01:14:25.761 --> 01:14:28.469
Hey, now that we got
what we came for, let's go.

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:31.374
- What?
- I already told you.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.071
After What you did,
I'm not lettin' you race.

01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:34.648
Dad.

01:14:37.773 --> 01:14:40.617
Look, we got her back.

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:42.553
It's the most
important thing, right?

01:14:43.746 --> 01:14:46.249
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Come on, Danny.

01:14:46.349 --> 01:14:47.828
I... I... I don't believe it.

01:14:47.917 --> 01:14:49.555
As the racers
lead to their marks,

01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:53.828
it appears the Jack family
have conceded their bench.

01:14:53.923 --> 01:14:55.960
Boo! Get off their bench!

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:03.605
Oh, no.

01:15:08.771 --> 01:15:10.182
Race two.

01:15:20.916 --> 01:15:23.920
And it looks like
this race goes to Japan.

01:15:25.821 --> 01:15:29.064
We are leading up to one
very exciting final race,

01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:32.696
with France and Japan
taking two of the eight spots.

01:15:32.795 --> 01:15:34.172
Race three.

01:15:38.768 --> 01:15:40.304
Antarctica, wins!

01:15:40.403 --> 01:15:41.711
Race four.

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:48.454
Germany, wins!

01:15:50.446 --> 01:15:51.948
Race five.

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:56.124
Jamaica, wins!

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:57.390
Race six.

01:16:01.257 --> 01:16:02.998
Singapore, wins!

01:16:03.092 --> 01:16:04.662
Race seven.

01:16:09.698 --> 01:16:12.008
United Kingdom, wins!

01:16:12.101 --> 01:16:14.240
The Wiener Dog Internationals

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:15.781
are underway
in the United States.

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:20.843
France, Germany and Japan
have advanced to the final race.

01:16:20.943 --> 01:16:23.753
Russia, thought to be
the favorite to win...

01:16:23.846 --> 01:16:25.553
...lost in their first race.

01:16:25.648 --> 01:16:29.994
All eyes now turn to the USA.

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:33.226
Now we are getting clown
to the final race,

01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:37.293
and it still appears that
Ms. Merryvveather is on the US bench.

01:16:37.393 --> 01:16:40.533
Oh, Princess. This is it.
This is our big moment.

01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:45.237
The question on everyone's lips:
What happened to the Jack family?

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:51.278
Dad?

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:57.686
Are we going home'?

01:17:15.764 --> 01:17:17.903
Excuse me.

01:17:18.567 --> 01:17:19.545
Judge Brown, sir.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:21.478
Yes, What it is?

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:24.847
I have the results of that
research you Wanted me to do.

01:17:25.875 --> 01:17:26.853
And?

01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:28.615
Well, it's not looking good, sir.

01:17:28.711 --> 01:17:30.691
I think the kids may be right.

01:17:30.779 --> 01:17:32.918
There are several instances
of known cloning,

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:35.427
and Merryvveather Industries
recently became a sponsor

01:17:35.518 --> 01:17:37.725
of several
of the countries involved.

01:17:38.854 --> 01:17:41.164
In fact,
most of today's winning dogs.

01:17:42.258 --> 01:17:44.397
A Wiener conspiracy.

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:45.938
- I'm afraid so, sir--
- Well.

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:49.237
Is there any way we can stop
Ms. Merryweather from racing?

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:53.837
Well, there's nothing in the rulebook
that specifically forbids it.

01:17:54.403 --> 01:17:56.576
Now, have you checked
all 37 translations,

01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:59.414
including Swahili
and Ancient Greek?

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:01.647
I don't believe so, sir.
I... I... I'll check again.

01:18:01.744 --> 01:18:02.779
Good.

01:18:04.079 --> 01:18:07.026
This isn't good. This is not good.

01:18:23.966 --> 01:18:25.673
I... I... I...
I don't believe it.

01:18:25.768 --> 01:18:27.475
The Jack family is back!

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:36.612
We'd like our bench back.

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:39.921
You just can't seem to make up your mind
about this whole racing thing, can you?

01:18:40.015 --> 01:18:44.464
Why don't you just step aside
and let me show you hovv it's done.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:48.126
Our mind is made up.
We're doing this race.

01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:49.828
Yeah, it's time for Shelly
to show the world What she's made of.

01:18:49.925 --> 01:18:52.997
Oh, I've seen
What she's made of. Literally.

01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:56.976
These jackets
have gotten too tight.

01:18:57.066 --> 01:19:00.275
- So last race.
- Definitely.

01:19:03.439 --> 01:19:05.749
They are bringing it
right clown to the wire,

01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:09.084
as the eighth race
is about to begin.

01:19:09.178 --> 01:19:10.885
Look, look! Look, it's Shelly!

01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:14.918
This is excitement.

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:20.430
Come and pick your
Wiener winter wear this Wednesday.

01:19:20.522 --> 01:19:22.195
Buy one, get one free!

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:29.635
Watch your family go clown
in the record books

01:19:29.732 --> 01:19:32.440
as the worst
racers in US History.

01:19:36.372 --> 01:19:38.010
What is this?

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:43.516
We have the fake Shelly!
Hovv did this happen?

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:45.853
Her name's Tricksy, now.
And she's mine.

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:49.486
There seems to be
some sort of commotion

01:19:49.585 --> 01:19:53.590
in the Japanese corner as the eighth
and final race takes to the track.

01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:56.431
This is it, girl.
You can do this.

01:19:56.525 --> 01:20:01.065
Listen, win or lose,
I love you, OK'?

01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:05.043
Excuse me, coming through.
Hey, have fun.

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:08.377
And you, do What you do best.

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:11.280
Win!

01:20:12.608 --> 01:20:15.088
Good luck, Shelly! Excuse me.

01:20:15.577 --> 01:20:17.887
Shelly, you were born to run.

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.039
Race eight.

01:20:47.376 --> 01:20:50.016
- And the US pulls Way ahead.
- Yes!

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.787
Shelly Jack possessed as she
pumps her way to the finish line.

01:20:55.884 --> 01:20:57.124
No!

01:20:57.219 --> 01:21:02.168
Oh, my gosh! I think Shelly Jack
has set world records today!

01:21:02.257 --> 01:21:03.793
This is not how
it's supposed to go clown.

01:21:03.892 --> 01:21:05.872
You're fired, Etsuko. Fired!

01:21:05.961 --> 01:21:08.373
You can't fire me. I already quit.

01:21:08.464 --> 01:21:11.343
Eight races have been
completed today, folks.

01:21:11.433 --> 01:21:14.039
And here is who remains
for the final:

01:21:14.136 --> 01:21:18.050
France, Japan, Germany,

01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:21.644
Jamaica, Singapore, United Kingdom,

01:21:21.744 --> 01:21:25.851
Antarctica and the USA.

01:21:27.383 --> 01:21:30.660
We are now gonna let the racers
regroup, but sit tight people,

01:21:30.753 --> 01:21:33.495
because the final race
is about to begin.

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:40.105
This is a private area.
Private. Private. Shoo!

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:49.947
Hey... thanks.

01:21:51.039 --> 01:21:54.111
For What? Stealing your dog?

01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:55.882
Well, maybe not for that part,

01:21:55.978 --> 01:21:57.924
but you know...
for the other stuff.

01:21:59.047 --> 01:22:01.527
You knovv,
Where you helped and stuff.

01:22:01.617 --> 01:22:04.029
You're welcome.

01:22:04.119 --> 01:22:08.158
You knovv, since you don't
actually live in Japan...

01:22:08.257 --> 01:22:10.533
...you know, I mean...

01:22:10.626 --> 01:22:14.836
I... I... I don't know...
maybe... maybe vve could--

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.910
Meet at another race?

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:21.874
I'm joking.
I'd love to see you again.

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:28.283
Goocl.
I mean, if that's what you want.

01:22:28.377 --> 01:22:29.355
Yeah.

01:22:31.547 --> 01:22:33.993
You know, I think Trioksy
is taking a liking to me.

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:35.993
You think
she may wanna adopt me?

01:22:37.119 --> 01:22:38.894
I think
she'll make room for you.

01:22:51.733 --> 01:22:54.236
You've gotten this far,
but that doesn't mean you won.

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:56.338
Nope.
Just means we have a chance.

01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:59.510
Not much of a chance
if you ask me.

01:22:59.608 --> 01:23:02.487
You notice something about
most of these dogs you're up against?

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:08.957
They're all cute.

01:23:09.051 --> 01:23:11.895
A lot of them have birthmarks,
exactly Where Shelly does.

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:13.898
You said that was the mark
of a champion, right?

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:17.402
Merryvveather Industries
cloned your dog, Danny.

01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:20.303
Shelly's racing
a bunch of Shellys.

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:27.376
And one of us is going to win.

01:23:27.469 --> 01:23:30.279
- That's not true.
- They don't all look alike.

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:34.218
Improvements on the original.
I don't care if you believe me.

01:23:34.309 --> 01:23:36.084
I didn't tell you
so we could be friends.

01:23:36.178 --> 01:23:39.625
I told you, so you know
exactly What you're up against.

01:23:39.715 --> 01:23:42.525
- There's only one Shelly.
- Not today.

01:23:42.618 --> 01:23:47.067
Ladies and Gentlemen, vve are calling
the racers back to the track.

01:23:47.155 --> 01:23:49.465
The final race is about to begin.

01:23:49.558 --> 01:23:52.129
I'd say good luck, but, you know...

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:55.037
Look, don't listen to her.

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:58.202
OK, I don't care
if Ms. Merryvveather did clone Shelly.

01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:02.180
They were basicallyjust a bunch of
blank slates when they were born.

01:24:02.271 --> 01:24:04.649
They Won't have
this girl's heart.

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:08.781
- I hope you're right.
- Me too.

01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:12.492
This is it. The final moment.

01:24:12.581 --> 01:24:16.791
The Winner of this race will be
the Winner of the Internationals.

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:18.558
A full year of preparation.

01:24:19.821 --> 01:24:25.396
A full day of races
have led us all to this moment.

01:24:31.433 --> 01:24:33.777
And the bell will ring in

01:24:33.869 --> 01:24:37.749
five... four... three...

01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:41.582
...two... one... Ring it!

01:24:49.785 --> 01:24:52.288
- Move your feet!
- Come on, Shelly! Come on!

01:25:07.803 --> 01:25:12.218
VVowie, wow, wieners!
That was a close one.

01:25:13.742 --> 01:25:16.382
<i>Oh, we're gonna have to go
to the cameras to see that.</i>

01:25:21.817 --> 01:25:23.455
She did it!

01:25:26.054 --> 01:25:28.557
No, F10, no!

01:25:28.657 --> 01:25:30.261
I'm still mad at you.

01:25:30.359 --> 01:25:31.702
But I'm really
proud of you, too.

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:35.103
Good job.

01:25:35.197 --> 01:25:39.771
This isn't over, Shelly.
We'll be back next year.

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:41.040
Right, Princess?

01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:43.707
Ms... Ms. Merryvveather?
You'll need to come with us.

01:25:43.805 --> 01:25:45.182
The... with the security guard.

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:47.480
We have to ask you a fevv questions
about Merryvveather Industries.

01:25:47.576 --> 01:25:51.388
Everything I did was Within
the confines of the rulebook.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:55.360
You may not be technically breaking
the rules today, Ms. Merryvveather,

01:25:55.450 --> 01:25:58.829
but rule 4.26 clearly states
that we reserve the right

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:01.161
to add a decimal point
to the rulebook.

01:26:01.256 --> 01:26:04.362
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, wouldn't I.

01:26:04.459 --> 01:26:07.372
You may have bought your Way
out of your last race.

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:12.241
You can't ban me from racing,
Judge Brown. I'll find a Way.

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:14.507
I know you will.

01:26:14.603 --> 01:26:16.776
And I'll be right there,
Waiting in the wings

01:26:16.872 --> 01:26:19.352
of the great Wiener Hall
to stop you.

01:26:19.441 --> 01:26:23.116
Now, take her away!

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:26.088
Wiener Hall?

01:26:33.155 --> 01:26:34.259
So, do you think We're done

01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:36.302
with this whole
Wiener dog-racing thing for awhile?

01:26:36.391 --> 01:26:38.871
I don't know. Ask her.

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:41.201
Can I get a quick picture
of you two and Shelly?

01:26:41.296 --> 01:26:42.673
- Sure.
- Yeah.

01:26:43.965 --> 01:26:47.003
She is an international treasure.

01:26:55.544 --> 01:26:59.356
OK. I'm about ready
to head home.

01:26:59.448 --> 01:27:01.189
Got my bunny loaded in the car.

01:27:01.283 --> 01:27:04.628
She was such a good find.
And this, for my mediation room.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:07.701
I just need to
fill my hug meter.

01:27:12.027 --> 01:27:13.404
So many hugs.

01:27:14.429 --> 01:27:15.874
I'm sorry for tricking you.

01:27:15.964 --> 01:27:17.739
Hey, you put that brain
to some better uses,

01:27:17.833 --> 01:27:19.403
you might change the World.

01:27:19.501 --> 01:27:21.208
Maybe I can clone something.

01:27:21.303 --> 01:27:23.476
Just hope
you don't clone yourself.

01:27:24.306 --> 01:27:25.410
Hey! So, you're taking off?

01:27:25.507 --> 01:27:28.488
Yep. It's about that time.
Oh, Melanie called.

01:27:28.577 --> 01:27:29.555
She said she's back in tovvn,

01:27:29.644 --> 01:27:31.487
and she Wanted you to meet her
in St. Joseph's.

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:33.787
Michigan's most romantic city.

01:27:33.882 --> 01:27:35.156
What'? Now'?

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:36.991
Look, I mean the sooner the better.

01:27:37.085 --> 01:27:40.396
I may have let it slip about
What you were planning to do.

01:27:41.857 --> 01:27:43.131
Why would you do that?

01:27:43.225 --> 01:27:45.000
Well, she needed to know that
the reason you Went to see her,

01:27:45.093 --> 01:27:48.563
and the reason you left before
proposing vvere the same: Family.

01:27:49.765 --> 01:27:53.235
Go, Dad. This is your chance
to be super romantic.

01:27:53.335 --> 01:27:55.713
- Instead of all grouchy.
- Oh, really. What do you think?

01:27:55.804 --> 01:27:58.307
Yeah, Dad. Relax.
I got the rugrats.

01:27:58.406 --> 01:28:00.283
- Go!
- Sure?

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:03.083
Come on, I'll drive ya!
I'm great at vvatchin' proposals.

01:28:03.178 --> 01:28:04.179
Hardly know I'm there.

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:06.156
OK. I'll... I'll go.

01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:10.320
“ Thank you
_ Go!» guys.

01:28:10.418 --> 01:28:11.556
- Thanks, guys.
- Go!

01:28:11.653 --> 01:28:14.395
- Go on, go! Get outta here.
- Go! Go! Go!

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:16.662
- OK, OK.
- And remember Dad,

01:28:16.758 --> 01:28:18.635
it's a marathon, not a race.

01:28:18.727 --> 01:28:20.104
I will remember that.

01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:24.076
So, anybody ready
for a new adventure?

01:28:24.166 --> 01:28:26.271
We're always ready
for a new adventure.

01:28:26.368 --> 01:28:27.506
You know, I hear there's some

01:28:27.602 --> 01:28:30.105
really great
Wiener dog races happening in Mexico.

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:33.718
I'm not going to Mexico
for a Wiener dog race.

01:28:33.809 --> 01:28:35.117
I knew you'd say that.

01:28:35.210 --> 01:28:36.883
So I actually made an itinerary

01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:40.187
of other things to do in Mexico
While me and Bridget race.

01:28:40.282 --> 01:28:43.354
Oh, and vve can sing
that "99 Hotdogs" song again!

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:46.261
But maybe this time
let's start at one thousand!

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:47.628
Yeah, not a chance!

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:47.088
Merryvveather Industries
was shutdown today

01:29:47.182 --> 01:29:50.391
due to mass speculation of
tampering with the integrity

01:29:50.485 --> 01:29:54.558
of the Wiener Dog Internationals,
a much loved family event.

01:29:56.124 --> 01:29:58.365
Over 150 cloned dogs
vvere taken away from the scene,

01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:02.931
and oddly all of them
were given homes

01:30:03.031 --> 01:30:09.471
in the small town
of New Glarus, Wisconsin.

01:30:12.307 --> 01:30:14.116
It's not clear whether
Ms. Merryvveather will be going to jail

01:30:14.209 --> 01:30:16.086
or paying a large fine,

01:30:16.177 --> 01:30:19.090
but one thing is certain,
she's not the Winner of this race.

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:21.353
No. No. No, no, no, no!

01:30:21.449 --> 01:30:24.623
<i>Just go</i> away! <i>I have no
comment. No comment! Hear me?</i>

01:30:26.187 --> 01:30:29.100
So rude! What has happened
to the press?

01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:31.363
Merryvveather Industries
was taken down today,

01:30:31.459 --> 01:30:35.601
as speculation for its contribution
to cloned vviener dogs everywhere,

01:30:35.697 --> 01:30:37.506
sent proponents of Wiener dog racing

01:30:37.599 --> 01:30:40.409
into a flurry
of allegations and lawsuits.

01:30:40.502 --> 01:30:43.244
The Jack family,
whose dog Shelly Jack,

01:30:43.338 --> 01:30:46.251
named in honor of shelter dogs
everywhere, had this to say...

01:30:46.341 --> 01:30:49.015
We've had run-ins with
Ms. Merryvveather in the past.

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:52.216
So I guess it's not that
surprising what she did.

01:30:52.314 --> 01:30:55.955
She's a pretty mean lady for sure,
but she's also kind of brilliant.

01:30:56.051 --> 01:30:58.156
I mean, who would have ever
thought she could be

01:30:58.253 --> 01:31:00.995
cloning something
and still remain so classy.

01:31:01.089 --> 01:31:02.762
But in an evil kind of way.

01:31:04.693 --> 01:31:06.673
Told ya we'd see more reporters.

01:31:06.761 --> 01:31:08.570
<i>"Told ya we'd see more reporters.</i> ”
