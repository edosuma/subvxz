WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.607
I am the government in this country,

00:03.670 --> 00:05.274
Stringfellow Hawke.

00:11.144 --> 00:12.384
Hawke!

00:12.813 --> 00:15.157
We're gonna go back there and bust him out.

00:17.117 --> 00:18.721
(Marella) Rescue One to Airwolf.

00:18.785 --> 00:20.389
[guns firing]

00:20.454 --> 00:22.434
Air support, combat.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

01:39.066 --> 01:40.943
(Ernie) Where is this Quinzumel?

01:41.001 --> 01:43.675
I told you, the museum
should've sent us to Crete,

01:43.737 --> 01:46.081
and we'd be diving for
sunken treasures right now.

01:46.139 --> 01:48.642
(Jonathan) And miss the chance to
explore an ancient Mayan culture.

01:48.709 --> 01:49.949
Listen to this.

01:50.010 --> 01:54.481
The Mayan civilization developed a calendar
superior to that of the Egyptians,

01:54.715 --> 01:59.687
and in mathematics they discovered
the use of zero before the Hindus,

01:59.987 --> 02:02.524
and they were considered
to be the most advanced.

02:02.589 --> 02:05.729
That book say anything about
the hotel where we're staying?

02:05.826 --> 02:08.931
You know, last summer
when Mommy took me to China,

02:08.996 --> 02:12.569
they had places that didn't
even have hot water.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.919
(Jonathan) Look, down there! Right
in the middle of all that jungle.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.461
[guns firing] It's them, the Mayan pyramids.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.599
(Ozzie) That's our dig, all right!

02:34.655 --> 02:37.795
And you kids get 2 whole
weeks to sift through it.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.858
Quite a change in climate,
crossing over those mountains.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.402
Yeah, it sure is.

03:12.459 --> 03:16.771
Lake Toneopah, the locals
call it the “Oven of the Gods.”

03:20.667 --> 03:23.580
There's our airstrip dead ahead.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.407
Señor Hathaway!

03:52.466 --> 03:54.969
Bienvenido! How you doing, boss?

03:55.669 --> 03:59.139
Tip-top Comargo, really raring
to go. Where is the bus?

03:59.206 --> 04:02.676
Over here. Dumb tie rod cracked on me.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.917
Don't worry, mechanic's got it 100%.

04:05.979 --> 04:09.859
Forged me a brand new one as
good as Detroit's. You'll see.

04:11.651 --> 04:14.962
- (Caitlin) Miguel, you forged that?
- Si, señora.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.228
- Good work.
- Gracias.

04:17.390 --> 04:20.666
You're not gonna find me driving
any clients across that lake

04:20.726 --> 04:23.469
in any vehicle that's not 100%.

04:23.530 --> 04:26.602
Good way to find yourself
as a pile of bleached bones.

04:26.666 --> 04:29.738
On the way to the temples is no
place to lose a wheel either,

04:29.803 --> 04:31.544
especially with guerrillas run’n around.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.108
There been a lot of guerrilla activity lately?

04:34.341 --> 04:35.718
Si, lots.

04:35.776 --> 04:39.280
Miguel, do not scare my friends.

04:39.546 --> 04:42.220
There's always going to be
bandits in those hills, señor.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.421
Alzar is not just a bandit, Comargo.

04:44.484 --> 04:47.954
This Alzar, he's one bad guerrilla, huh?

04:48.822 --> 04:50.597
Si, señor.

04:51.024 --> 04:55.473
Across the Toneopah, many people
are joining the side of Alzar

04:55.529 --> 04:58.135
because he says he is against Americans.

05:00.500 --> 05:04.277
Señor Hathaway, we gotta work out that trip.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.516
Follow me.

05:10.076 --> 05:11.282
What have you got for me?

05:11.344 --> 05:14.484
Ozzie, my friend, you're going to be happy.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.618
[laughing]

05:15.916 --> 05:20.626
6th Century, nicest pre-Colombian
stuff you ever saw.

05:20.687 --> 05:24.362
But are you going to be able
to smuggle it all at one time?

05:24.424 --> 05:27.871
I have this private plane to
load up, I can take out a fortune.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.636
You just get the shipment
ready while I'm at the dig.

05:30.697 --> 05:32.335
I'll do my best, boss.

05:32.399 --> 05:34.675
You know you can count on me
to make it worth your while.

05:34.734 --> 05:36.645
[laughing] You got it.

05:40.540 --> 05:43.851
You know Cate, I'm a little bit
worried about what that mechanic said.

05:43.944 --> 05:48.859
Hawke, there have been bandits out
here for years. We're gonna be fine.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.189
Take care, huh?

05:54.221 --> 05:58.033
Thanks. I will. Bye.

06:01.461 --> 06:02.769
Thanks.

06:17.344 --> 06:20.325
(Kay) Jeez, it's so hot. The least they
could do is have air-conditioning.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.381
[man exclaiming]

06:21.448 --> 06:24.088
I'd give $5 for a chocolate soda.

06:24.150 --> 06:28.758
Hey listen, we ought to have a contest
to see who finds the first artifact.

06:31.658 --> 06:35.037
(Comargo) Don't worry, little ones,
we'll be out of the desert soon.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.974
In the mountains it's very cool, no?

06:44.271 --> 06:47.218
What'd I tell you, gang? Safe and sound, huh?

06:48.008 --> 06:50.488
Maybe you want to open up the windows,

06:50.543 --> 06:53.820
let the mountain breezes get in your lungs.

06:53.880 --> 06:54.881
[Comargo laughing]

07:06.693 --> 07:08.934
(Caitlin) Comargo, did we leave the main road?

07:09.029 --> 07:11.635
(Kay) Short cut señorita,
big windstorm last month

07:11.698 --> 07:13.735
knocked some trees across the bridge.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.280
Comargo, I think we're going the wrong way.

07:16.336 --> 07:17.974
No, we're not, boss.

07:18.038 --> 07:21.281
The temple is back that way. It's got to be.

07:21.341 --> 07:24.584
Boss, there's some very
valuable stuff around here

07:24.644 --> 07:27.181
you'll be interested in looking at.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.488
[Comargo exclaiming in Spanish]

07:29.549 --> 07:30.994
Hey Comargo, take it easy!

07:31.051 --> 07:32.655
Is everybody okay?

07:32.852 --> 07:34.331
Yeah, we're okay.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.333
[sighing] There's got to be
a better road around here.

07:36.389 --> 07:39.563
Now turn around and find some
other way. That's an order.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.556
My best greetings to Colonel Arturo Alzar.

08:05.986 --> 08:09.399
Okay, just do whatever he says.
Understand? No heroics.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.697
That's very wise of you, señorita.

08:11.992 --> 08:15.235
You, fat man, you follow behind.

08:16.029 --> 08:19.067
[speaking Spanish]

08:25.572 --> 08:27.984
[all yelling]

08:58.004 --> 08:59.608
[guns firing]

08:59.672 --> 09:01.379
{whooping]

09:16.756 --> 09:18.895
All right, everybody out!

09:35.108 --> 09:37.019
Jefe.

09:37.911 --> 09:41.552
So Comargo, our paths cross again.

09:42.115 --> 09:46.791
Colonel, I am very honored you remember me.

09:47.387 --> 09:51.802
Comargo, if you know this boss-man,
tell him about the business.

09:51.958 --> 09:54.199
Tell him I can make him a fortune.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.170
You can speak for yourself.

09:59.732 --> 10:01.268
I have means of exporting

10:01.334 --> 10:04.144
any amount of pre-Colombian art
you can lay your hands on.

10:04.204 --> 10:08.550
I have buyers in the States, they're
paying 10’s of thousands for good pieces.

10:08.608 --> 10:12.385
Colonel, let us go and I'll be your Agent.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.219
You have the only access to the temples

10:14.280 --> 10:17.386
now that you're controlling
so much of Quinzumel.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.596
If I controlled the whole world,

10:22.655 --> 10:25.135
and could not control my own greed,

10:25.892 --> 10:27.565
I would be nothing.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.843
Bribery will be added to your list of crimes.

10:32.732 --> 10:34.575
Take them away.

10:36.669 --> 10:38.307
Move.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.110
(Kay) Where are we?

10:40.173 --> 10:41.345
(Cookie) I don't know.

10:41.407 --> 10:43.284
What's going to happen?

10:43.343 --> 10:46.881
(Caitlin) We're gonna be
okay. We're gonna be fine.

10:49.849 --> 10:53.763
(Caitlin) Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.
Just do what they want.

11:21.481 --> 11:22.653
(Dominic) Go ahead, Michael.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.922
(Michael) Well, we have
a little more information.

11:24.984 --> 11:28.522
Their bus has been found abandoned
in territory known to be held

11:28.588 --> 11:31.899
by a Colonel Arturo Alzar.

11:32.292 --> 11:37.264
We also have unconfirmed reports of Americans
being sighted inside his compound.

11:37.564 --> 11:38.668
Terrific.

11:38.731 --> 11:40.711
(Stringfellow) You know, Michael,
I really don't understand.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.371
Caitlin cleared this thing with your office,

11:42.435 --> 11:44.608
just like we all do when we go overseas.

11:44.671 --> 11:48.619
And we gave her the green light, I know.
And we feel terrible about it.

11:48.808 --> 11:53.052
But Alzar's new activity
just took us all by surprise.

11:53.680 --> 11:58.220
He used to be just a local nuisance,
little more than a bandit.

11:58.551 --> 12:02.693
He must have gotten some new backing
somewhere, a big brother in the region.

12:02.755 --> 12:04.632
He'd never risk this without it.

12:04.691 --> 12:05.965
Well, who's his backer?

12:06.025 --> 12:08.266
That's what I want you to find out.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.604
So get down there, free those people,

12:10.663 --> 12:15.203
and then if you can, find out who's
behind Alzar and what his plans are.

12:16.336 --> 12:17.337
[sighing]

12:17.403 --> 12:21.374
Map coordinates to follow. Good luck.

12:29.682 --> 12:31.389
[chirping]

12:33.853 --> 12:36.834
Never seen one outside a zoo before.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.730
Psittacine.

12:38.791 --> 12:42.864
Genus Amazona ochrocephala oratrix.

12:42.929 --> 12:43.930
What?

12:43.997 --> 12:45.772
A parrot.

12:48.701 --> 12:51.113
I'm sick and I'm getting worse.

12:51.170 --> 12:53.013
- Come here.
- Really.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.345
Well, you don't have a fever, Kay.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.987
How can you tell without a thermometer?

12:59.612 --> 13:01.091
Braille system.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.028
(Ernie) Cookie.

13:08.154 --> 13:10.156
What's really gonna happen now?

13:10.256 --> 13:12.930
Whatever it is, I ain't gonna barf over it.

13:12.992 --> 13:15.370
Hey, I didn't barf…

13:16.329 --> 13:17.865
very much.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.284
What the devil were you
trying to pull with Alzar?

13:26.339 --> 13:29.286
I was trying anything. I was trying to save us.

13:29.342 --> 13:32.050
I'm not a smuggler. I was just
hoping he would go for that.

13:32.111 --> 13:33.988
Comargo's the one that turned us in.

13:34.113 --> 13:35.990
Comargo's your friend, Ozzie.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.029
He took a wrong turn, maybe.

13:38.084 --> 13:41.395
We were sold out man, and you're responsible.

13:42.221 --> 13:43.700
[Kay screaming]

13:50.163 --> 13:54.339
It's okay. You're all right.
You're okay. You're okay.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.578
[laughing]

14:00.073 --> 14:02.781
I brought you a very rich gift, my friend.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.346
Their scientific equipment, their cameras,

14:06.412 --> 14:10.485
plus nearly $20,000 in traveler's checks.

14:11.884 --> 14:13.886
Chema, you ever think back to the time

14:13.953 --> 14:16.559
when we were both driving taxis in the States?

14:16.622 --> 14:19.762
Do I ever Arturo, do I ever?

14:21.394 --> 14:23.931
And if a limo from Boca Raton had
a flat tire in the Everglades,

14:23.996 --> 14:25.498
what would you do?

14:25.565 --> 14:29.479
Strip it clean, just like you would.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.844
I don't settle for stripping anymore.

14:35.942 --> 14:40.516
I take the whole car. I take the whole country.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.786
That's a hell of a big bite
to take, my old friend.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.990
Kidnapping US citizens.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.760
I am not afraid.

14:48.821 --> 14:52.792
You must have some protection. Some juice?

14:54.761 --> 14:55.865
Yes.

14:55.928 --> 15:00.468
Jefe, the connection to Havana is made.

15:02.001 --> 15:06.006
Hello? Yes, this is Colonel Alzar.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.778
Hello, my friend.

15:13.679 --> 15:16.182
(Dominic) I've got something.
There's a camp dead ahead.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.956
(Stringfellow) I got it.

15:18.017 --> 15:20.327
25, 30 people.

15:20.386 --> 15:24.391
And I'm getting a lot of heat sources.
Some kind of sophisticated machinery.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.198
Yeah, military machinery.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.533
That's it.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.164
If Cate can just give some kind of signal…

15:30.229 --> 15:32.903
If Caitlin is in there, she'll find a way.

15:36.402 --> 15:39.713
[machine beeping]

15:44.944 --> 15:46.753
Move, come on.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.299
[helicopter approaching]

16:09.435 --> 16:12.939
Move. Everybody get up. Get up and move around.

16:13.372 --> 16:15.579
Just move. Keep moving.

16:17.844 --> 16:20.120
I've got something.

16:21.214 --> 16:24.161
Give that lady a cigar for ingenuity.

16:24.784 --> 16:29.494
B-L-A-S…

16:29.689 --> 16:31.600
Keep moving, move!

16:32.391 --> 16:38.239
O-U-T-H?

16:39.298 --> 16:43.178
W-A-L-L. Wall.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.973
Blast south wall.

16:46.072 --> 16:48.780
Let's take out that wall and Caitlin
and the kids'll get in the courtyard.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.117
String, what we need is a little diversion.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.919
Looks like an ammo dump down river.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.254
(Dominic) At 10:00.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.432
[guns firing]

17:34.387 --> 17:37.425
Okay, okay, get up against that wall
and get these mattresses. Come on.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.560
(Ozzie) Okay, do what she said, kids.

17:38.624 --> 17:39.762
(Cookie) Whoa, whoa what are we doing?

17:39.825 --> 17:41.099
(Ozzie) Come on, get down. Hurry up.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.037
- (Caitlin) Quick, move it.
- What's going on?

17:43.563 --> 17:47.204
[guns firing]

18:25.605 --> 18:26.982
Small cannon.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.177
Roger.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.327
(Caitlin) Get outside. Come on.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.728
(Jonathan) Hurry up.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.857
[chattering]

18:43.155 --> 18:44.793
(Ozzie) Get out there. Get out there.

19:12.551 --> 19:13.859
Get the bazooka.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.415
Hang on!

19:41.047 --> 19:44.551
Come on baby, climb.

19:51.957 --> 19:53.368
No!

19:53.926 --> 19:55.462
(Caitlin) Hawke!

20:14.580 --> 20:16.116
It will not fly far.

20:33.365 --> 20:35.174
Stay inside of this.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.187
Oh, come on, baby.

20:56.222 --> 20:59.692
(Caitlin) Okay, everybody
get out! Clear the basket!

20:59.759 --> 21:01.204
Move.

21:44.503 --> 21:45.607
Oh, man.

21:45.938 --> 21:47.508
- Well?
- Well,

21:47.573 --> 21:49.644
the pitch link was damaged by that rocket.

21:49.708 --> 21:50.948
I figured as much.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.149
[groaning] How is it, your back?

21:53.445 --> 21:55.925
It's been out before. I'll be okay.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.452
What about String?

21:59.518 --> 22:01.964
He jumped off the net, so we could lift off.

22:04.256 --> 22:06.133
That sounds like him.

22:08.227 --> 22:10.002
What about Ozzie?

22:10.062 --> 22:11.166
He didn't make it either,

22:11.230 --> 22:14.439
but I don't think self-sacrifice
is in his character.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.071
Character or not, one thing's for sure,

22:17.136 --> 22:19.639
we're gonna go back there and bust him out.

22:19.705 --> 22:21.378
A deal?

22:21.640 --> 22:24.211
Deal. Thanks.

22:25.077 --> 22:26.078
[sighs]

22:28.380 --> 22:30.223
Can you fix the radio?

22:30.282 --> 22:33.195
No, the generator's out.

22:33.252 --> 22:34.492
Anyway, using the radio

22:34.553 --> 22:37.693
would be the surest way of letting
those bandits know where we are.

22:37.756 --> 22:41.033
Well, do you think they'll come after us?

22:41.360 --> 22:43.362
Yeah, I'd bet my last dollar.

22:43.429 --> 22:45.375
If for nothing else, they're
going to come after Airwolf.

22:45.431 --> 22:49.846
You know, the human body can
survive without food for 60 days,

22:49.935 --> 22:51.073
but without water…

22:51.136 --> 22:54.208
Jon, thank you.

22:55.574 --> 22:57.781
You know, that mechanic across the lakebed,

22:57.843 --> 22:59.914
if he's as good with
aircraft as he is with buses,

22:59.979 --> 23:01.617
we don't have anything to worry about.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.853
All we have to do is get Airwolf over there.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.190
Yeah? How?

23:05.251 --> 23:08.425
We'll do it together. Let's go.

23:17.730 --> 23:21.542
[grunting}

24:08.080 --> 24:10.492
Kay, put this in the cockpit for me, okay?

24:10.549 --> 24:12.085
Yeah.

24:17.356 --> 24:19.097
Cookie, there's lotion in that kit in there.

24:19.224 --> 24:20.828
No, it's all right.

24:21.193 --> 24:23.639
And they're gonna need it more than me.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.668
Kay.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.110
Didn't you already have a drink?

24:29.335 --> 24:33.477
No, I didn't, you started with Ernie.

24:45.584 --> 24:48.861
Okay guys, the recess is over.

24:52.091 --> 24:54.298
You are a lying spy.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.140
My name is Stringfellow Hawke.

24:57.262 --> 24:59.572
I work for a private charter service

24:59.698 --> 25:02.338
hired by the Los Angeles Archeological Museum

25:02.401 --> 25:05.143
to transport a group of science students

25:05.204 --> 25:07.013
on a field trip to Quinzumel.

25:07.072 --> 25:11.851
A charter service that just happens
to own a military helicopter?

25:11.977 --> 25:14.753
It's a private aircraft, experimental.

25:14.813 --> 25:17.851
With private and experimental weapons.

25:18.384 --> 25:21.991
Why does Washington send such a
mixed bag of agents to Quinzumel?

25:22.121 --> 25:25.068
What kind of listening
posts are you setting up?

25:25.124 --> 25:29.834
Colonel, those young people are
exactly what they say they are.

25:29.962 --> 25:32.067
Their presence here is illegal!

25:32.131 --> 25:34.008
They were given government permits.

25:34.066 --> 25:37.104
I am the government in this country

25:37.202 --> 25:40.740
and I do not permit foreigners
to steal our heritage.

25:40.806 --> 25:44.015
You damn Americans take anything
you want, anywhere in the world.

25:44.143 --> 25:48.353
You steal the record of our past
like brats from a candy store!

25:48.547 --> 25:53.394
Strip us of our civilization, a
civilization more advanced than yours.

25:53.752 --> 25:57.825
My ancestors had calendars
and astrological observatories

25:57.890 --> 26:02.396
when your ancestors were still living
in caves and painting themselves blue!

26:09.334 --> 26:12.008
You will be tried by a people's court.

26:12.104 --> 26:16.917
Before we are through with you, the
world will know your name, I promise.

26:18.277 --> 26:22.225
You will be as famous as Francis Gary Powers,

26:22.281 --> 26:24.989
Stringfellow Hawke.

26:33.725 --> 26:35.671
(Dominic) Damn it Cate,
I feel like a big lummox,

26:35.761 --> 26:37.866
sitting up here while all
you people are working.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.534
I know, Dom.

26:39.898 --> 26:44.313
But your back's too bad and I
need you to steer it anyway.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.280
How're we doing?

26:46.338 --> 26:48.750
I'm not exactly sure where we came down.

26:48.807 --> 26:51.651
I can tell you we're in for a
couple of days of hell, maybe more.

26:51.710 --> 26:54.987
Yeah, I just hope they
don't come looking for us.

26:55.047 --> 26:58.187
Bite your tongue. Listen,
how're the kids doing?

26:58.250 --> 27:00.753
Great, they're just great.

27:00.953 --> 27:04.924
If they just work together
and don't lose heart.

27:17.703 --> 27:21.446
Dom, the wind's coming up. It looks
like we're gonna have a sandstorm.

27:24.743 --> 27:26.313
(Dominic) Worse.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.324
- Stop right here!
- What?

27:28.380 --> 27:29.381
Stop! stop!

27:29.448 --> 27:31.155
Stop!

27:35.487 --> 27:37.091
(Dominic) All right, drop your harness.

27:37.156 --> 27:40.069
Get outta your harness, get back here.

27:43.128 --> 27:44.573
All right, come here.

27:44.630 --> 27:46.940
Let's swing this bird around,
so the guns are facing ‘em.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.376
Aren't your systems out?

27:48.433 --> 27:50.936
The radio's out and she can't
fly, otherwise she's perfect.

27:51.003 --> 27:54.678
Now get back there, swing me
around. Come on, let's go.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.970
It's one of Alzar's men. They followed us.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.801
Hold it right there.

28:20.065 --> 28:23.535
I have been sent by my
Commander, Colonel Alzar.

28:23.602 --> 28:25.775
You must return to the camp at once.

28:25.837 --> 28:28.078
Well, you send the Colonel our regrets.

28:28.574 --> 28:32.716
And tell him we're on our
way home. Now back off.

28:32.778 --> 28:34.348
Back off or I’ll shoot.

28:36.915 --> 28:40.328
You remain his prisoners. I have my orders.

28:40.385 --> 28:41.955
[guns firing]

28:44.723 --> 28:47.670
Then die here, in the “Oven of the Gods.”

28:54.666 --> 28:56.304
Okay kids, get ready.

28:56.368 --> 28:58.541
- But they're leaving.
- (Dominic) Not on your life.

28:58.604 --> 29:00.447
Get ready to swing ship.

29:05.310 --> 29:06.482
Turn right. Turn right.

29:06.545 --> 29:07.922
Turn right.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.569
Port! Come on, push the other side.

29:27.633 --> 29:28.703
Come on, quick. Push her left.

29:28.767 --> 29:29.768
Push.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.478
Mamma mia, what am I doing?

29:34.640 --> 29:37.712
Caitlin, get in here, and give me a Copperhead.

29:47.219 --> 29:48.391
[beeps]

30:04.236 --> 30:06.443
Hey, I'm over here.

30:06.505 --> 30:08.678
I know where you are, slime.

30:15.914 --> 30:17.325
[whooping] Yeah.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.429
(Ernie) Yeah, let's go.

30:24.923 --> 30:26.197
You were wonderful.

30:26.258 --> 30:27.293
- Great shot.
- All right

30:27.359 --> 30:30.306
If you could've just somehow saved
the jeep, we'd have been home free.

30:30.362 --> 30:32.603
Jonathan, you get a good idea, fine,

30:32.664 --> 30:34.507
until then, just be thankful.

30:44.810 --> 30:46.312
[sighs]

30:46.611 --> 30:49.990
- You get some sleep.
- Can you hold on a minute?

30:50.982 --> 30:52.825
Yeah.

30:53.919 --> 30:57.093
- What? What's up?
- I've been thinking.

30:59.057 --> 31:02.300
I mean, something like this
really makes you think, right?

31:04.029 --> 31:06.771
It's like I've really
never been scared before.

31:09.901 --> 31:11.881
Yeah, a little bit maybe.

31:12.070 --> 31:16.177
Cookie, we're gonna make it.

31:16.842 --> 31:19.755
But just say in some lousy case we don't.

31:20.112 --> 31:24.492
Well, there could be one experience.

31:26.084 --> 31:27.722
I mean, I've been thinking.

31:28.120 --> 31:32.159
You're absolutely… there's no better
lady in this whole world than you,

31:33.024 --> 31:36.995
and it's sort of a special experience.

31:38.930 --> 31:41.171
Get what I'm kind of referring to?

31:43.668 --> 31:45.147
Yeah.

31:48.707 --> 31:50.015
Cookie,

31:51.610 --> 31:54.250
you're right, it really is very special,

31:54.312 --> 31:57.623
but it doesn't mean anything unless
you share it with someone you love.

31:57.682 --> 31:58.922
Caitlin.

31:58.984 --> 32:01.624
I'm very fond of you, Cookie.

32:03.955 --> 32:05.400
Yeah.

32:09.661 --> 32:11.698
You get some sleep.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.380
[laughing]

33:08.186 --> 33:09.460
[both grunting]

33:11.790 --> 33:14.293
Hold it right there.

33:16.795 --> 33:18.399
Hey, he said hold it.

33:18.463 --> 33:20.875
Relax, muchacho.

33:33.211 --> 33:36.215
You see, my plan worked like a million dollars.

33:36.281 --> 33:38.818
It was a great plan, Jon.
You guys were brilliant.

33:38.884 --> 33:41.455
Ernie, you're a positive lion.

33:41.853 --> 33:45.096
Thanks Cookie, without you
I would've ruined everything.

33:45.156 --> 33:46.794
You're welcome, Kay.

35:23.054 --> 35:24.829
[man grunting]

35:34.132 --> 35:37.045
(Alzar) I don't know what to do
with an insect like you.

35:37.469 --> 35:41.417
A man who hides behind
children for his own profit.

35:42.173 --> 35:44.210
You're hardly worth a bullet.

35:45.443 --> 35:47.320
What are you going to do?

35:47.912 --> 35:49.653
I don't know.

35:50.415 --> 35:53.191
You know, it is not hard to kill a man,

35:53.652 --> 35:56.656
but you don't deserve a man's death.

35:58.089 --> 36:00.433
Take him away, he offends me.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.988
[greeting in Spanish]

36:26.685 --> 36:28.961
I'm not a man? You butchers!

36:31.723 --> 36:33.566
[guns firing]

36:33.825 --> 36:34.826
How's that?

36:37.529 --> 36:39.008
Who isn't a man?

36:54.846 --> 36:57.759
[sighs] Stringfellow's
escaping! Stop him. Stop him!

37:07.425 --> 37:11.134
Get me Air Minister Pizarro
in Havana. This is Arturo Alzar.

37:11.196 --> 37:13.506
Get the armored vehicle ready,
we're going in pursuit.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.408
And load the 50-caliber.

37:17.302 --> 37:20.374
Mr. Minister? I regret
I must ask you for a favor.

37:21.372 --> 37:24.410
Yes sir, air support, combat.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.254
[tires screeching]

38:20.665 --> 38:22.474
Dom, I got through to Washington.

38:22.534 --> 38:23.808
They said Marella is well on her way.

38:23.868 --> 38:26.007
She should be here any second
with that transport.

38:26.070 --> 38:28.380
What'd they say about String and Ozzie?

38:29.040 --> 38:31.646
I told ‘em, we're going back.

38:38.116 --> 38:41.962
Archangel's got reports of MiGs
being scrambled out of Cuba.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.523
They're headed this way.

39:05.710 --> 39:08.350
[sighs] This is Little Brother, do you read me?

39:08.413 --> 39:12.418
(man) Red Squadron leader to Little
Brother. Come in, Little Brother.

39:12.483 --> 39:15.054
Welcome to our airspace, Comrade Major.

39:15.286 --> 39:16.856
With the exception of this vehicle,

39:16.921 --> 39:19.925
you may feel free to fire
on anything that moves,

39:19.991 --> 39:24.167
and particularly anything that flies.

39:33.638 --> 39:35.811
All set Cate, keep your fingers crossed.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.820
[beeping]

39:45.884 --> 39:47.090
Come on, baby.

39:47.151 --> 39:49.290
All systems coming online.

40:05.303 --> 40:07.078
Attagirl.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.942
Looks pretty good so far, Dom.

40:10.675 --> 40:12.052
(Caitlin) Come on.

40:12.510 --> 40:14.114
(Dominic) Power's up.

40:14.178 --> 40:16.488
Easy does it. Come on.

40:18.549 --> 40:19.994
- Damn.
- What is it?

40:20.051 --> 40:23.055
I can't get enough power to the turbines.

40:41.306 --> 40:42.785
Move over, Cate.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.413
Hawke, you made it.

40:45.476 --> 40:47.080
How'd you get away?

40:47.211 --> 40:49.418
Ozzie got me out, before they killed him.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.955
Let's get this lady in the air.

40:53.017 --> 40:56.487
We can't get enough speed in the
turbines to start her, Hawke.

40:56.921 --> 40:58.366
(Stringfellow) Bypass the mains, Dom.

40:58.923 --> 41:01.995
We'll try for a quick start on the secondaries.

41:05.797 --> 41:09.574
Go lady, go. Go, sweetheart, go.

41:13.504 --> 41:16.849
(Marella) Rescue One to
Airwolf. I'm 5 miles out.

41:25.016 --> 41:27.121
[chattering]

41:29.287 --> 41:31.358
[guns firing]

41:40.665 --> 41:44.670
Rescue One to Airwolf. Final approach.

41:45.803 --> 41:49.012
(Stringfellow) Marella, we're
drawing fire. Go around.

44:19.223 --> 44:20.896
Good job, Marella.

44:29.834 --> 44:32.872
Airwolf will escort us all the way home.

44:34.105 --> 44:35.982
My name's Marella.

44:36.307 --> 44:41.052
This is the first airline I've ever
heard where all the pilots are women.

44:43.014 --> 44:44.721
[chattering] Hey, look out there.

44:52.823 --> 44:54.962
- Bye.
- Bye Airwolf.

44:58.729 --> 44:59.935
(Caitlin) Would you look at that?

44:59.997 --> 45:02.944
Hardship just rolls off their backs.

45:03.467 --> 45:05.947
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?

45:06.003 --> 45:09.246
Now, what would you do if you had
to live it all over again, huh?

45:09.807 --> 45:13.482
Well, I'll tell you one thing,
<i>if</i> I had to live it over again,

45:14.045 --> 45:16.457
I wouldn't want to do it with anybody else.
