FROM THAT BOOK.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.595
WE NEED TO GO BACK
TO THE ANTECHAMBER.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.724

TO GET THE CEREMONY RIGHT.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.101
WHAT IF WE'VE
MADE A MISTAKE?

14:12.184 --> 14:14.061

AND YOU GOT ALL THIS?

14:42.047 --> 14:45.676
- OKAY, LOOK
AT THE PAGE NUMBER, 1881.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.636

"THE BOOK OF THE DEAD WAS
ETCHED INTO THE SIDE OF TOMBS."

14:55.394 --> 14:57.438
- YEAH, STILL NOT LIKING
ALL THIS TOMB TALK.

14:57.521 --> 15:00.816
- SOMEONE CIRCLED
A SECTION OF IT, BUT WHY?

15:00.899 --> 15:02.860
WHY THESE SYMBOLS?

15:02.943 --> 15:04.069

IF THERE'S ONLY CERTAIN
SYMBOLS WE'RE LOOKING AT,

15:15.164 --> 15:16.415
I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO DECODE THEM.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.167
- GREAT, I'LL COME WITH YOU.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.335
