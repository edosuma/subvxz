00:05.421 --> 00:07.957
In New York City's war on crime,

00:07.957 --> 00:11.081
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:11.081 --> 00:12.996
of the Major Case Squad.

00:12.996 --> 00:14.890
These are their stories.

00:17.173 --> 00:20.096
I swear I don't know how it happened.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.565
That I can find out.

00:22.752 --> 00:24.243
Just give me a chance.

02:28.791 --> 02:30.796
We got paper from the ME.

02:30.796 --> 02:34.215
You gotta dig up 26A14B.

02:34.215 --> 02:36.953
Turns out the guy
used to be a TV star.

03:26.976 --> 03:28.946
Natural causes?

03:28.946 --> 03:30.815
What did you do, a drive-by intake?

03:30.815 --> 03:32.529
He was outdoors three or four weeks,

03:32.529 --> 03:33.643
exposed to the elements.

03:33.643 --> 03:35.010
He was hanged.

03:35.010 --> 03:37.910
After his ribs were broken.
How do you miss that?

03:37.910 --> 03:39.317
Did you even look at him?

03:39.317 --> 03:41.067
We should come back.

03:41.317 --> 03:43.636
Yeah, I looked at him.

03:43.950 --> 03:45.298
See?

03:48.100 --> 03:50.419
What does this mean, "WNL. WNL."

03:50.419 --> 03:54.787
WNL. I found body disposition
and protocols within normal limits.

03:54.787 --> 03:58.027
No. WNL, we never looked.

03:58.027 --> 03:59.571
I checked with Missing persons.

03:59.571 --> 04:01.876
That's about all you checked.

04:01.876 --> 04:03.586
You're fired.

04:10.276 --> 04:12.973
That may come back
to haunt you, Rodgers.

04:13.343 --> 04:15.547
What galls me...

04:15.916 --> 04:18.428
"Skater" Stevens was murdered.

04:18.428 --> 04:20.862
If he wasn't a celeb,
nobody would even know.

04:20.862 --> 04:22.994
Yeah. Celeb?

04:22.994 --> 04:25.720
Do you believe this?
Logan swears he's never heard of him.

04:25.720 --> 04:27.336
Two of us.

04:27.336 --> 04:29.466
Alvin "Skater" stevens?

04:29.466 --> 04:32.874
From the sitcom "goofing around"?
It ran for years.

04:33.606 --> 04:36.926
So, uh, this thing was a junkie?

04:36.926 --> 04:37.886
Had been.

04:37.886 --> 04:39.465
Pretty much clean the last six months.

04:39.465 --> 04:41.003
Before that, living hard.

04:41.003 --> 04:42.346
How bad?

04:42.346 --> 04:44.291
If the dentist hadn't
confirmed he was 30,

04:44.291 --> 04:45.962
I'd have put him at 50.

04:45.962 --> 04:47.260
How bad was the beating?

04:47.260 --> 04:49.344
Short but merciless.

04:49.344 --> 04:51.884
Even for a child star,
this kid fell far.

04:51.884 --> 04:53.637
Skater's mom is on her way in.

04:53.637 --> 04:56.910
Maybe we can spare her
some of the details.

04:57.118 --> 05:00.620
I get the feeling this isn't the first time
that Skater's broken her heart.

05:00.620 --> 05:02.600
Enjoy, Rodgers.

05:02.600 --> 05:03.613
Yeah.

05:03.867 --> 05:06.395
Skater, I can't go to the prom with you.

05:06.395 --> 05:08.047
I already made plans.

05:08.047 --> 05:09.441
With who?

05:10.095 --> 05:12.086
Could it be Kirk?

05:17.829 --> 05:19.467
Come on, Karen.

05:19.965 --> 05:23.775
Kirk. Oh, no, not again!

05:26.740 --> 05:29.333
That was Skater's Skater noise.

05:29.333 --> 05:30.399
Yeah?

05:30.399 --> 05:32.107
I gave it to him.

05:32.431 --> 05:36.749
I said, "honey, to be a star,
you have to have a signature, a hook."

05:36.749 --> 05:39.203
Wheeler, Logan,
this is Mrs. Stevens.

05:39.203 --> 05:41.919
Skater's mom, Lucinda.

05:42.194 --> 05:44.017
He was such a beautiful boy.

05:44.017 --> 05:45.923
We're sorry for your loss.

05:45.923 --> 05:49.930
I don't understand how "Skater" Stevens
ended up in a pauper's grave.

05:49.930 --> 05:52.064
There was no missing persons report.

05:52.064 --> 05:53.683
No, not formally.

05:53.683 --> 05:57.195
Then you weren't in close touch.

05:57.505 --> 06:01.702
The last few years, I told him it was
his responsibility to keep up.

06:01.702 --> 06:03.036
Did he?

06:03.036 --> 06:05.306
A postcard in June.

06:05.306 --> 06:07.812
Said he was going back to stand-up,
had a job.

06:07.812 --> 06:09.700
Any idea where?

06:09.975 --> 06:11.822
His friends might know.

06:11.822 --> 06:14.132
There's a memorial for him tonight.

06:14.132 --> 06:16.754
They passed the hat, flew me in.

06:16.754 --> 06:19.016
Why did you change your mind?

06:19.358 --> 06:20.944
A week ago,

06:20.944 --> 06:24.748
you called the studio
and asked them to help find him?

06:25.333 --> 06:27.722
Wonder street films
produced "goofing around."

06:27.722 --> 06:29.532
They made a fortune off Skater.

06:29.532 --> 06:31.476
So you just called him
out of the blue?

06:31.476 --> 06:34.028
I mean, was there
any particular reason?

06:34.028 --> 06:38.131
Well, they just announced
"goofing around" as coming out on DVD.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.604
My Skater, he was terrible with money.

06:40.604 --> 06:44.232
Oh. So you thought if there was
a check coming from the DVD,

06:44.232 --> 06:46.813
you'd hold onto it.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.080
Those checks,

06:50.080 --> 06:52.174
if they even got to Skater,

06:52.174 --> 06:54.967
they just slipped through his fingers.

06:57.632 --> 06:58.985
Officer.

07:03.673 --> 07:04.864
Some mother.

07:04.864 --> 07:07.829
She didn't love Skater,
just saw her son as a meal ticket.

07:07.829 --> 07:09.388
If anybody had cared about him,

07:09.388 --> 07:11.450
he wouldn't have ended up in potter's field.

07:11.450 --> 07:13.142
Least he didn't stay there.

07:13.142 --> 07:14.985
You guys pulled him out.

07:17.489 --> 07:19.093
And even now,

07:19.093 --> 07:22.401
I can't believe that Skater's not gonna
come down those stairs and say,

07:22.401 --> 07:23.534
come on.

07:28.543 --> 07:30.347
I gave him that.

07:30.717 --> 07:34.198
He played my best pal for five years.

07:34.198 --> 07:36.713
He'll never stop being that.

07:39.294 --> 07:40.931
Thank you.

07:43.368 --> 07:46.356
Oh, no, no.
Thank you, thank you very much.

07:48.556 --> 07:53.611
So Skater's whole career
was playing a doormat to Kirk?

07:53.611 --> 07:56.271
More like he worshipped Kirk.

07:56.271 --> 07:57.992
Everybody did.

07:58.928 --> 08:00.209
You had to be there.

08:00.209 --> 08:02.229
Oh, I see.

08:02.530 --> 08:03.953
Hello.

08:06.049 --> 08:07.957
Thank you for coming.

08:10.783 --> 08:14.692
So you must be from TV guide
for the interview.

08:14.692 --> 08:16.399
Not quite.

08:16.842 --> 08:18.885
Different interview.
You got a minute?

08:18.885 --> 08:22.012
Oh, sorry.
I thought you were...

08:22.420 --> 08:23.498
Yeah, sure, sure.

08:23.498 --> 08:27.311
Look, we're trying to get a handle
on the last few months of Skater's life.

08:27.311 --> 08:29.908
Oh, well, good luck.

08:29.908 --> 08:32.393
I thought you were his best pal.

08:32.697 --> 08:35.551
We both had our childhoods
taken from us.

08:35.551 --> 08:37.030
That's a bond.

08:37.030 --> 08:38.623
Kirkster, could you sign this, please?

08:38.623 --> 08:40.155
How about lately?

08:40.155 --> 08:42.509
Well, doing okay.

08:43.033 --> 08:46.501
No acting, but I'm still
keeping a hand in the business.

08:46.501 --> 08:47.917
Production side.

08:47.917 --> 08:49.781
We were talking about Skater.

08:49.781 --> 08:52.047
Had you been in touch with him lately?

08:52.047 --> 08:54.471
Long after everyone else
gave up on him.

08:54.471 --> 08:56.297
Know where he lived?

08:56.583 --> 08:57.963
Where he worked?

08:57.963 --> 08:59.563
Hand-to-mouth.

08:59.563 --> 09:03.749
I mean, last I saw him,
he'd just lost a fast food job.

09:03.749 --> 09:06.092
Slipped him a few 20s.

09:06.092 --> 09:09.353
Told him it was an advance
on our residuals.

09:09.353 --> 09:12.059
Oh, there's my interview.

09:15.119 --> 09:18.024
Have you got a recent photo
of Skater on that thing?

09:18.024 --> 09:19.471
Oh, sure.

09:19.891 --> 09:21.372
Here you go.

09:27.599 --> 09:28.629
You're kidding.

09:28.629 --> 09:31.454
An ice cream window boy for Sweet Swirl?

09:31.454 --> 09:33.509
On the show, his after-school job,

09:33.509 --> 09:35.400
soft serve vendor.

09:35.654 --> 09:37.966
Orange shirt, brown pants.

09:37.966 --> 09:39.615
Say again what your guy wore.

09:39.615 --> 09:41.719
Brown shirt, orange pants.

09:41.719 --> 09:43.976
- Fooled me.
- Fools a lot of people.

09:43.976 --> 09:46.645
Must be 30 trademark
infringer operators out there.

09:46.645 --> 09:49.042
These people, they're vultures.

09:49.042 --> 09:52.997
Substandard ice cream treat,
inferior melody.

09:53.317 --> 09:55.048
Here's the McCoy.

10:01.709 --> 10:03.068
Catchy.

10:03.638 --> 10:05.210
Can't improve on that.

10:05.210 --> 10:08.710
So no home address 'cause our guy
was never your employee.

10:08.710 --> 10:11.956
You don't keep track of these vultures?

10:11.956 --> 10:12.952
We don't.

10:12.952 --> 10:15.023
Unless we get their bills.

10:15.023 --> 10:18.024
Three weeks ago, we got a call
from the city impound lot.

10:18.024 --> 10:20.286
They wanted us to pick up
one of our trucks.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.136
Thing was, it wasn't our truck.

10:22.136 --> 10:23.948
Three weeks ago.

10:23.948 --> 10:26.283
Do you remember
which impound lot it was?

10:27.565 --> 10:28.790
Major case.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.944
Let me get the lock.
It might be tricky.

10:31.472 --> 10:33.530
Looks like a tough one.

10:34.179 --> 10:36.545
Maybe we should call the FBI.

10:44.112 --> 10:46.862
This is a real rathole.

10:47.843 --> 10:49.564
Yeah, but it's Skater's
truck, all right.

10:49.564 --> 10:51.721
It's his wall of fame.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.833
It looks like he spent
all his time in here.

10:53.833 --> 10:55.363
Smells like it too.

10:55.363 --> 10:59.537
Stale. Sleep and sweat.

11:01.133 --> 11:03.235
Birdbaths in the sink.

11:03.235 --> 11:05.718
Looks like he was living here.

11:08.525 --> 11:10.202
Could be a stalker.

11:10.202 --> 11:12.453
Look at the way he hides this girl.

11:13.377 --> 11:15.248
That's one photo, Delgado.

11:15.248 --> 11:18.652
One photo he hid.
She might be special to him.

11:18.652 --> 11:20.549
He didn't want his
customers seeing her.

11:20.549 --> 11:23.753
Customers? He wasn't selling
ice cream out of this truck.

11:23.753 --> 11:25.799
It's a rusted piece of crap.

11:25.799 --> 11:28.979
He didn't even have
a refrigerator in here.

11:29.276 --> 11:31.190
I wonder what he was selling.

11:31.190 --> 11:35.447
Wouldn't be the first time a child star
went from using to dealing.

11:35.447 --> 11:37.560
Where'd you say they towed this from?

11:37.560 --> 11:40.230
McCarren park,
down by the handball courts.

11:40.645 --> 11:43.664
We have a child sitcom star
dealing drugs to children

11:43.664 --> 11:46.288
out of an ice cream truck in the park.

11:46.288 --> 11:47.495
Heartwarming.

11:47.495 --> 11:49.214
Do we have anything else?

11:49.214 --> 11:52.109
This girl's picture was in his truck.

11:53.284 --> 11:54.443
So that's a no.

11:54.443 --> 11:57.167
Okay. Put together a snew team,

11:57.167 --> 11:59.474
put the truck back in the park,
see who shows up.

11:59.474 --> 12:00.473
A snew team?

12:00.473 --> 12:04.103
Captain, it's a straight buy and bust.
We can handle that.

12:04.103 --> 12:06.007
It's a piece of cake.

12:08.202 --> 12:10.755
Two hours in that truck
with that song on.

12:10.755 --> 12:12.167
How you holding out, Wheeler?

12:12.167 --> 12:13.925
Well, it's funny how this whole time

12:13.925 --> 12:17.119
only three kids have come up
to an ice cream truck.

12:17.119 --> 12:19.986
Well, kids wise up fast.

12:21.375 --> 12:24.811
Oh, there's kid number four.

12:24.811 --> 12:26.548
Copy. I'll lose him.

12:27.488 --> 12:30.995
Sorry. We're, um, waiting for ice.
We're closed.

12:38.698 --> 12:40.731
Damn, Wheeler.

12:41.193 --> 12:43.924
That black guy on your right,
he just made you.

12:44.755 --> 12:46.172
Okay.

12:48.939 --> 12:51.246
She's closed.

13:28.420 --> 13:30.896
Police! Put down the weapons!

13:34.779 --> 13:36.007
Let that kid go!

13:36.007 --> 13:37.651
Hey, let him go!

13:42.837 --> 13:44.014
Don't move.

13:59.328 --> 14:01.123
What the hell was that?

14:01.123 --> 14:04.169
Yeah. Why are we still alive?

14:16.628 --> 14:19.000
Bullets went through
both sides of the truck.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.473
Cheap metal.

14:20.473 --> 14:22.262
No. Nasty guns.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.370
A Czech scorpion, a pray and spray.

14:24.370 --> 14:28.230
And a .9-millimeter Gyurza
and I think a Polish P-64.

14:28.230 --> 14:31.105
So, extrapolating,
you'd agree with Logan,

14:31.105 --> 14:33.319
you two shouldn't be alive.

14:33.586 --> 14:35.397
These guys were blasters.

14:35.397 --> 14:37.409
Count inside the car,
there were four of them.

14:37.409 --> 14:38.852
They used the kid as a shield.

14:38.852 --> 14:40.436
We were outnumbered, outgunned,

14:40.436 --> 14:43.012
then all of a sudden
they put their guns away

14:43.012 --> 14:44.786
- and split.
- Just like that.

14:44.786 --> 14:47.559
No backup coming,
no sirens scaring them off?

14:47.559 --> 14:48.736
Nope.

14:48.736 --> 14:49.842
What do we know about the target?

14:49.842 --> 14:52.415
How does that guy
connect to Skater Stevens?

14:52.415 --> 14:54.126
So far we know his name's Chibueze.

14:54.126 --> 14:56.854
He's Nigerian,
and he's legal, a licensed peddler,

14:56.854 --> 14:59.218
and the bullet just grazed him.

14:59.218 --> 15:01.204
So you all got lucky.

15:01.204 --> 15:02.339
Not lucky.

15:02.339 --> 15:04.253
They let us off the hook.

15:04.253 --> 15:06.806
Our victim won't go in the ambulance.

15:06.806 --> 15:09.842
He's afraid the blasters
are gonna take him out at the ER.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.338
Did you offer him an escort?

15:11.338 --> 15:14.028
No sale.
Just wants to go.

15:14.028 --> 15:17.690
The kid, the one who fronted
for the Nigerian, where's he?

15:18.211 --> 15:21.179
He took off when the car
backed down the road.

15:21.179 --> 15:22.287
I see.

15:22.287 --> 15:25.131
You saved his life,
so you thought he'd stay put.

15:25.131 --> 15:27.264
Well, there was a lot going on.

15:28.903 --> 15:30.615
He dropped his lunchbox.

15:30.615 --> 15:34.460
No lunch, but there are some baseball
cards and a Harry Potter DVD.

15:34.460 --> 15:36.994
Great. That should make him
easy to trace.

15:37.174 --> 15:39.030
I got a favor to call in.

15:39.227 --> 15:41.017
Do I hold Chibueze?

15:41.017 --> 15:42.364
On what charge?

15:42.364 --> 15:45.035
He let the kid get caught
in the crossfire.

15:45.035 --> 15:46.741
So did you.

15:48.895 --> 15:53.274
How much you wanna bet this Chibueze guy
doesn't have health insurance?

15:53.274 --> 15:55.714
Let's offer him some free medical.

15:56.953 --> 15:58.868
There you go.

15:58.868 --> 16:02.381
Your construction wound
should be fine.

16:02.381 --> 16:03.187
He's all yours.

16:03.187 --> 16:04.796
There he is, Mr. Ace bandage.

16:04.796 --> 16:07.496
Logan. No more favors.

16:07.496 --> 16:09.370
Rodgers fix you up?

16:09.565 --> 16:11.021
Where is my shirt?

16:11.021 --> 16:13.394
That's in shirt heaven.
I got you a new one.

16:13.394 --> 16:15.090
- Here.
- I have to go to work.

16:15.090 --> 16:17.235
Back out there?
Someone's got it in for you.

16:17.235 --> 16:18.548
Any idea who?

16:18.548 --> 16:20.496
I just wanted ice cream.

16:20.496 --> 16:23.464
So you sent the kid up ahead of you
to check out the flavors?

16:23.464 --> 16:24.782
You could have gotten him killed.

16:24.782 --> 16:27.347
He was pleased with
the way I paid him.

16:30.271 --> 16:31.165
Whoa.

16:31.165 --> 16:32.626
Hey, Chibueze.

16:32.842 --> 16:34.992
Chibueze, hold on a second.

16:35.257 --> 16:36.428
Listen.

16:36.922 --> 16:39.153
I could book you
for endangering that kid,

16:39.153 --> 16:40.342
take away your peddler's license.

16:40.342 --> 16:41.821
I don't want to play
those games with you.

16:41.821 --> 16:44.403
And what game is this,
scare the African?

16:45.151 --> 16:46.424
You're alive.

16:46.424 --> 16:49.529
Your friend Skater,
by the time he got here...

16:49.822 --> 16:51.955
They killed Skater?

16:51.955 --> 16:54.498
That's right.
Wanna see the photos?

16:54.498 --> 16:55.975
So who's "they?"

16:55.975 --> 16:57.460
You saw them.

16:57.460 --> 16:59.340
- Not my tribe.
- No.

16:59.340 --> 17:01.817
But two hours after Skater's
truck arrived, so did they,

17:01.817 --> 17:04.281
and so did you.

17:04.708 --> 17:07.340
What kinda drugs were you and Skater
selling out of that truck?

17:07.340 --> 17:10.455
I don't sell drugs.

17:10.740 --> 17:12.648
I sell tube socks
and irregular underwear,

17:12.648 --> 17:14.368
uptown, Spanish Harlem.

17:14.368 --> 17:16.803
Then what were you doing in Brooklyn?

17:17.777 --> 17:20.335
I thought Skater was back.

17:20.335 --> 17:23.146
But Skater always warned me
not to let the girl see me.

17:23.146 --> 17:25.198
What girl is this?

17:25.198 --> 17:27.089
The Albanian girl.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.411
Now I don't use that word again.

17:29.569 --> 17:30.946
This girl, does she have a name?

17:30.946 --> 17:32.442
She wouldn't say her name to me.

17:32.442 --> 17:34.313
Can you describe her?

17:37.394 --> 17:39.581
Cold.

17:39.581 --> 17:41.987
Like this room.

17:42.190 --> 17:43.918
Her picture...

17:43.918 --> 17:46.839
he taped it on the wall of his truck.

17:46.839 --> 17:49.096
He kept it covered.

17:49.096 --> 17:51.919
So she was all his.

17:55.238 --> 17:58.075
How much time do you think

17:58.075 --> 18:00.780
before I'm back in this room?

18:24.352 --> 18:27.782
I heard you ran into
some bad dude Albanians.

18:27.782 --> 18:29.987
This is a good dude Albanian.

18:29.987 --> 18:33.679
Detective Zim Flamur
from organized crime control.

18:33.679 --> 18:38.483
Zim says that our shell casings
read Albanian mob.

18:38.746 --> 18:40.471
OCC?

18:40.471 --> 18:42.147
You put away that Albanian gang

18:42.147 --> 18:44.819
that was making a bid to become
the sixth mob family.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.833
Yeah, nice work on that.

18:46.833 --> 18:48.744
See, cops know.

18:48.744 --> 18:50.254
TV, the press.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.938
It's all still Italian mobsters.
They're stuck in the '70s.

18:52.938 --> 18:54.536
And we're stuck in the '80s.

18:54.536 --> 18:59.303
The truck they shot up belonged to
a former TV star, "Skater" Stevens.

18:59.303 --> 19:01.189
The "ackackack" guy?

19:01.436 --> 19:03.057
My kids loved him.

19:03.057 --> 19:05.355
Any of these guys look familiar?

19:07.303 --> 19:08.862
This blaster we met.

19:08.862 --> 19:10.318
Ditmir Minojilj.

19:10.318 --> 19:12.249
One son of a bitch.

19:12.531 --> 19:14.251
Son of a bitch.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.032
In my home country,

19:16.032 --> 19:19.326
he shot out a rival gang
with an RPG-25.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.707
An antitank weapon?

19:20.707 --> 19:23.354
If he's such a tough guy,
why didn't he take out my detectives?

19:23.354 --> 19:24.762
'Cause they're not in blood with him.

19:24.762 --> 19:27.333
If they were, they'd be dead
with the Nigerian.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.349
"In blood" like a vendetta?

19:29.349 --> 19:30.428
Older.

19:30.428 --> 19:33.478
From the 15th century Code of Lek.

19:33.478 --> 19:35.558
You're not up on that, Wheeler?

19:35.558 --> 19:37.156
Goren would have known.

19:37.156 --> 19:39.193
An offense to it demands blood.

19:39.193 --> 19:42.846
But it can't be enforced
if there's a child, a woman,
or a stranger in the picture.

19:42.846 --> 19:46.102
The lunchbox kid, Wheeler, and Logan.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.572
That's why they left.

19:47.572 --> 19:51.097
But yesterday's target,
the Nigerian, he's still in blood.

19:51.097 --> 19:52.462
Is he in protective custody?

19:52.462 --> 19:54.249
Wouldn't take it.

19:54.749 --> 19:56.866
Better pick him up before they do.

19:56.866 --> 19:58.033
Yeah.

20:22.986 --> 20:24.488
It's okay.

20:45.632 --> 20:49.965
Well, I guess this is
what Ditmir means by "in blood."

20:51.261 --> 20:53.622
No drug stash.
Just disks and recorders.

20:53.622 --> 20:57.216
Skater and Chibueze
were counterfeiting DVDs.

20:57.388 --> 21:00.920
Imagine getting killed over
a Harry Potter DVD.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.442
Oh, god.

21:02.442 --> 21:03.574
What?

21:03.574 --> 21:04.746
I missed it.

21:04.746 --> 21:06.263
That dvd. The kid had the same one.

21:06.263 --> 21:08.086
That's not out yet.

21:08.086 --> 21:11.086
That's worth a fortune
for about three more weeks.

21:11.086 --> 21:13.344
Then why did the Albanians
leave him behind?

21:13.344 --> 21:15.006
There were con ed guys on the street.

21:15.006 --> 21:17.052
They heard Chibueze's screams,
called 911.

21:17.052 --> 21:19.818
The killers hit and ran.

21:21.141 --> 21:24.498
Well, at any rate,
this is Skater's operation.

21:24.498 --> 21:27.718
Copied the DVDs here,
and Chibueze sold for him,

21:27.718 --> 21:30.693
and somehow they both
ended up in blood.

21:33.569 --> 21:35.057
I never heard of this one either.

21:35.057 --> 21:37.447
None of these movies are out yet.

21:37.710 --> 21:39.566
Skater was sitting on a gold mine.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.848
And living in a truck.

21:42.536 --> 21:46.298
Let's get these back to the squad
and see if they're real.

21:48.247 --> 21:49.506
And this one?

21:49.506 --> 21:51.309
"Skater stands up!"

21:52.028 --> 21:54.079
- Hey, you stink! 
- Come on!

21:54.079 --> 21:55.493
Come on, get them up.

21:55.493 --> 21:59.260
None of you guys are jealous
that I starred in "goofing around"?

21:59.260 --> 22:02.328
- None?
- No way! / Right.

22:04.251 --> 22:05.710
He's bombing.

22:05.710 --> 22:09.625
Five years, 110 episodes
in 120 countries?

22:09.625 --> 22:10.908
You suck!

22:10.908 --> 22:12.306
I should be rich, right?

22:12.306 --> 22:13.802
All right, well,
guess what this is.

22:13.802 --> 22:17.815
It's my latest royalty check
from Wonder street films.

22:17.815 --> 22:19.155
Guess how much?

22:19.155 --> 22:21.236
Drumroll, please!

22:22.677 --> 22:25.998
$49.37. Hi-oh!

22:25.998 --> 22:27.385
Not funny, pal.

22:27.385 --> 22:29.392
You're right. It's not funny.

22:29.807 --> 22:32.482
I got screwed by Wonder street,

22:32.482 --> 22:34.466
as in, uh...

22:34.466 --> 22:38.406
I wonder where
they're hiding my money.

22:38.878 --> 22:41.312
Raging against the studio.

22:41.312 --> 22:42.995
That's his act?

22:42.995 --> 22:46.187
It may not have been an act.
He was obsessed.

22:46.187 --> 22:47.495
Except for the Harry Potter,

22:47.495 --> 22:50.477
all the unreleased DVDs
were from the same studio.

22:51.481 --> 22:53.269
Wonder which one.

22:54.853 --> 22:56.666
Yeah. Thank you very much.

23:00.817 --> 23:02.708
That was the head of the studio
at Wonder street.

23:02.708 --> 23:04.240
They're in deep mourning.

23:04.240 --> 23:05.239
Over Skater?

23:05.239 --> 23:06.721
Over the counterfeit DVDs.

23:06.721 --> 23:10.969
Turns out that every title Skater had
in his cave is from their holiday list.

23:10.969 --> 23:14.581
Early cuts, all limited distribution,
eyes only.

23:14.581 --> 23:16.912
Did you tell them
we're sorry for their loss?

23:16.912 --> 23:18.400
They're ballistic.

23:18.400 --> 23:21.050
If Skater weren't dead,
they'd kill him.

23:21.050 --> 23:23.651
Do they have any idea
how he got hold of these copies?

23:23.651 --> 23:25.686
They're positive the leaks
aren't in-house.

23:25.686 --> 23:27.803
Still, a lot of their work
is outsourced.

23:27.803 --> 23:30.655
Trailers, dubbing, special effects.

23:30.655 --> 23:34.293
They're faxing us a list of everyone
who had access to early cuts.

23:34.293 --> 23:36.069
Let's hit the pavement.

23:36.376 --> 23:38.187
You got your gumshoes on?

23:42.402 --> 23:44.273
Two down, nine to go.

23:44.273 --> 23:46.194
Translation films. What's that?

23:46.194 --> 23:48.501
It's a foreign language dubbing house.

23:48.501 --> 23:50.920
Oh. Apres vous.

23:55.284 --> 23:57.134
Slow, slow.

23:57.134 --> 23:58.244
Look.

23:58.244 --> 24:01.547
That's the dream girl
from Skater's wall.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.209
Girl dresses like that up front
usually means

24:07.209 --> 24:10.168
she has a big daddy in the back.

24:14.633 --> 24:17.580
Skater's old friend Kirk.

24:18.795 --> 24:20.611
Oh, no.

24:20.611 --> 24:22.114
Gonna be all right, Wheeler?

24:22.114 --> 24:23.498
Shut up.

24:26.749 --> 24:28.609
Well, well, well.

24:29.083 --> 24:31.550
Willie "Kirk" Tunis.

24:31.879 --> 24:34.092
Is there someplace we could talk?

24:34.092 --> 24:37.266
Uh, actually, I'm
in the middle of a session.

24:37.266 --> 24:39.420
Is that what you call it?

24:39.655 --> 24:41.525
It's about your friend Skater.

24:41.525 --> 24:45.326
Seems he got caught up
with some DVD bootleggers.

24:45.994 --> 24:48.308
He got killed for that?

24:49.370 --> 24:54.120
Um, Mira, could you pour
the detectives some coffees?

24:59.559 --> 25:00.839
Nice walk.

25:00.839 --> 25:02.389
Actress working temp?

25:02.389 --> 25:04.274
No, no. We met through friends.

25:04.274 --> 25:07.041
And I really am in a session.

25:07.041 --> 25:07.775
Yeah, well, uh,

25:07.775 --> 25:10.916
we were just wondering,
seeing as this is a dubbing house,

25:10.916 --> 25:13.983
if your friend Skater
had access to new releases.

25:13.983 --> 25:15.161
Here? You crazy?

25:15.161 --> 25:16.971
The studios, they'd shut us down.

25:16.971 --> 25:18.899
Every disk is locked up tight.

25:18.899 --> 25:20.109
It's like a bank.

25:20.109 --> 25:22.929
Two people have to be there
when it's unsealed.

25:22.929 --> 25:24.606
- I'll be right down, okay?
- Okay.

25:24.606 --> 25:26.774
Two people, like you and Skater?

25:26.774 --> 25:28.552
You said he was your best pal.

25:28.552 --> 25:30.552
Well, was.

25:30.552 --> 25:32.430
- But, uh...
- Thanks.

25:32.630 --> 25:35.216
Other than our past,
we didn't have anything in common.

25:35.216 --> 25:38.358
I've got a name to protect,
a reputation.

25:38.358 --> 25:40.510
I would never jeopardize that.

25:40.510 --> 25:43.554
That sounds a little rehearsed.

25:43.554 --> 25:45.880
- Did it?
- Yeah.

25:46.370 --> 25:47.845
That does happen a lot

25:47.845 --> 25:50.850
'cause I was on TV, and my voice,
my cadence, is so familiar

25:50.850 --> 25:53.256
that people can't believe
it's just me talking.

25:53.256 --> 25:56.243
They think it's a performance.
It's weird.

25:56.782 --> 25:58.537
That must be it.

25:58.537 --> 26:01.612
Willie? They're waiting.

26:02.214 --> 26:03.171
You're busy now.

26:03.171 --> 26:06.303
Is there a chance you can
come downtown later today,

26:06.303 --> 26:08.204
take a look at some mug shots
of bootleggers?

26:08.204 --> 26:10.069
Sure, sure.
3 o'clock okay?

26:10.069 --> 26:12.284
- Oh, that'll be perfect.
- Great.

26:12.520 --> 26:13.869
Appreciate it.

26:19.358 --> 26:24.106
I thought that Willie said that he and
Skater didn't have much in common.

26:35.722 --> 26:37.983
I heard the cops came by today.

26:39.397 --> 26:41.263
For a second.

26:41.472 --> 26:43.372
Why not tell me,

26:44.338 --> 26:46.064
huh?

26:47.826 --> 26:49.998
Maybe I can't trust you.

26:49.998 --> 26:52.573
Maybe I need to have
a talk with Willie.

26:52.573 --> 26:53.865
Small scare.

26:53.865 --> 26:56.178
Willie was fine with them.

26:59.615 --> 27:01.915
There's no need to hurt Willie.

27:01.915 --> 27:03.668
Yet.

27:04.744 --> 27:06.173
No?

27:08.803 --> 27:10.994
Why hurt the golden goose?

27:10.994 --> 27:16.892
Why? We just mess his
beautiful golden goosey hair, hmm?

27:16.892 --> 27:18.107
Yeah?

27:20.766 --> 27:22.173
Walk with me.

27:22.483 --> 27:24.524
I want you to meet a guy
I brought in from special frauds.

27:24.524 --> 27:26.107
He's turned something up.

27:26.369 --> 27:28.446
Ira, this is my partner Logan.

27:28.446 --> 27:29.415
Hey.

27:29.415 --> 27:31.093
Tell him about the darknet.

27:31.093 --> 27:32.224
Look at him.

27:32.224 --> 27:34.139
"darknet." He's thinking,

27:34.139 --> 27:35.682
"this guy's too old
to be playing dungeons."

27:35.682 --> 27:38.155
No, we're grateful for any help.

27:38.155 --> 27:39.186
Okay.

27:39.186 --> 27:42.871
Every one of these unreleased movie
titles that got your guy Skater toasted

27:42.871 --> 27:46.597
were all, all posted weeks ago
on the darknet.

27:49.296 --> 27:51.975
So that would be like
the underground internet

27:51.975 --> 27:54.651
where they download stolen movies?

27:55.911 --> 27:58.209
Darknet, internet.

27:58.209 --> 28:00.249
It's a pretty inaccessible area,

28:00.249 --> 28:03.221
but there are undercover
net cops busting people.

28:03.221 --> 28:05.884
Originally, it was just
a few college kid movie fans

28:05.884 --> 28:07.805
file sharing and swapping bad prints.

28:07.805 --> 28:10.886
The ones where they tape the films
in the theater and their camcorders,

28:10.886 --> 28:14.320
and you got people talking
and walking in front of the screen.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.566
Right. But the stuff Skater had.

28:16.566 --> 28:18.358
Primo. Straight from Wonder street.

28:18.358 --> 28:23.523
Figure by now half the cities in Asia
have copies of it out on the street.

28:24.286 --> 28:26.032
Thanks for the info.

28:29.016 --> 28:31.509
It's 3:30. Kirk was supposed
to be here by now.

28:31.509 --> 28:33.606
So the studio screwed Skater,

28:33.606 --> 28:35.619
Skater screwed the studio.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.620
So why would the Albanians care?

28:37.620 --> 28:39.669
They can't be working for Wonder street.

28:39.669 --> 28:41.377
Oh, they can't?

28:41.862 --> 28:45.595
Well, maybe they thought they
had the exclusive with Skater.

28:46.117 --> 28:48.744
There's no answer at reception.

28:49.154 --> 28:50.470
Let's go there.

28:54.318 --> 28:55.568
Please!

28:55.770 --> 28:57.770
I didn't tell them anything.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.059
Please.

29:07.843 --> 29:10.949
Tell me, whose turn, you or Stephen?

29:10.949 --> 29:12.567
I, I go.

29:15.416 --> 29:16.847
You think we don't know.

29:16.847 --> 29:18.789
We know what you're doing.

29:24.120 --> 29:25.460
You told the police.

29:25.460 --> 29:26.989
No!

29:33.538 --> 29:35.049
No!

29:45.283 --> 29:47.719
No! Come on!

29:54.046 --> 29:55.017
Mira, where's Willie?

29:55.017 --> 29:57.139
Over there in the storage room.

29:59.242 --> 30:00.711
Oh, my bad.

30:03.224 --> 30:04.097
Police!

30:04.097 --> 30:06.409
Hands up, hands up!
Against the wall!

30:13.311 --> 30:14.630
You got him?

30:15.673 --> 30:17.215
Okay, yeah. Good.

30:21.684 --> 30:23.587
- Call for a bus!
- Got it!

30:23.587 --> 30:26.009
Willie. Willie!

30:30.902 --> 30:32.582
Is he gonna make it?

30:42.394 --> 30:44.576
Another minute,
he'd never have come back.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.785
You saved his life.
Shouldn't you be interviewing him?

30:46.785 --> 30:49.871
I tried. If he was grateful,
he kept it to himself.

30:52.376 --> 30:55.324
I told your partner
I don't know a Ditmir.

30:55.324 --> 30:56.857
I don't know these guys.

30:56.857 --> 30:59.880
You didn't run a DVD
piracy scam with Skater,

30:59.880 --> 31:03.178
but somehow Skater had access
to your studio cuts?

31:03.178 --> 31:05.521
I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:05.521 --> 31:06.824
I wish I knew more.

31:06.824 --> 31:09.079
I can't believe I once
had a crush on this guy.

31:09.079 --> 31:11.885
Yeah. We were all young
and naive once.

31:11.885 --> 31:14.228
Let him go.
The Albanians will tail him.

31:14.228 --> 31:15.635
We should too.

31:27.128 --> 31:28.730
Private charter jet.

31:28.730 --> 31:31.869
Next stop, Costa Rica.

31:33.327 --> 31:35.301
When they start to board, move.

31:35.301 --> 31:36.476
Okay.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.765
Again. Keep shining.

32:07.939 --> 32:09.068
Hi.

32:09.872 --> 32:11.596
Uh, Willie Tunis.

32:21.884 --> 32:23.041
Police!

32:23.624 --> 32:26.000
Nice and easy, Ditmir.

32:29.657 --> 32:30.912
Willie.

32:31.107 --> 32:33.262
Come on, let's go. Come on!

32:41.437 --> 32:45.054
Nice shine. It's gonna have to
last you 60 years.

32:50.610 --> 32:53.775
We've got Mira, Willie,
and Ditmir in separate rooms.

32:53.775 --> 32:55.684
Runners at every base.

32:55.684 --> 32:57.095
Who do we pick off first?

32:57.095 --> 32:59.441
Mira. She's a survivor.

32:59.441 --> 33:02.935
Let me take a pass at her
while Willie watches.

33:07.236 --> 33:09.664
We don't keep a cot here,

33:09.664 --> 33:12.271
so you might be more
comfortable in a chair.

33:12.271 --> 33:15.422
What if I stand, hmm?

33:19.152 --> 33:21.389
Is that better for you?

33:21.389 --> 33:22.741
That's much, much better.

33:22.741 --> 33:23.637
Hey, what?

33:23.637 --> 33:25.056
What the hell's going on?

33:25.056 --> 33:27.816
I'd say Mira's about
to feed you to my partner.

33:27.816 --> 33:30.862
You can feed first,
but tick-tock.

33:30.862 --> 33:32.406
What do you want to know?

33:32.406 --> 33:35.881
How does a girl like you
end up with a Skater or a Willie?

33:36.858 --> 33:38.882
Not pretty enough for TV stars?

33:38.882 --> 33:40.609
Sure, you are.

33:40.820 --> 33:43.575
One of those guys
didn't even have a shower.

33:43.575 --> 33:45.013
Skater.

33:45.013 --> 33:47.310
He came to me to shower.

33:47.780 --> 33:52.108
Sometimes, we shower three,
four times a day.

33:52.108 --> 33:55.252
- That's a lot of showers.
- I like to shower.

33:56.010 --> 33:57.811
Do you?

33:58.034 --> 34:01.181
Oh, I, uh, I love to shower.

34:01.181 --> 34:03.003
In fact, you and I should, uh,

34:03.003 --> 34:06.081
talk about that sometime later.

34:06.831 --> 34:09.007
Meanwhile, think you could help me out?

34:09.007 --> 34:12.757
My boss, he, uh, needs some answers
about how you met Skater.

34:12.757 --> 34:13.914
Blind date.

34:13.914 --> 34:15.513
Ditmir fixed me up.

34:15.513 --> 34:17.521
Oh, they were friends.

34:17.837 --> 34:21.018
Skater was selling DVDs from his truck.

34:21.018 --> 34:22.947
First-class copies.

34:22.947 --> 34:24.431
Ditmir saw them,

34:24.431 --> 34:26.592
he asks me to make friends with Skater.

34:26.592 --> 34:30.215
Oh, so maybe he wanted to know
who Skater's source was.

34:32.504 --> 34:34.632
Final seconds.

34:35.225 --> 34:37.385
Look, look, okay.

34:37.385 --> 34:41.539
I duped some cuts,
but it was just to help out Skater.

34:41.539 --> 34:45.467
It was like he, he'd hit
the bottomless bottom.

34:45.467 --> 34:47.766
You and Skater hook up.

34:47.967 --> 34:50.177
How long before you and Willie
have a shower?

34:50.177 --> 34:51.745
I work fast.

34:51.745 --> 34:55.687
Willie, he shows me his setup,
gives me personal tour.

34:56.012 --> 34:57.809
I bet.

34:59.745 --> 35:02.439
But you've had Willie
and his studio cuts,

35:02.439 --> 35:07.604
I mean, I guess that
Skater's just deadweight.

35:08.352 --> 35:11.367
I know nothing about that.
Nothing.

35:13.302 --> 35:15.389
Put her in a holding cell.

35:15.630 --> 35:18.040
No. No, no, no, no, no, wait, wait.

35:18.040 --> 35:20.930
What about our shower?
I don't care for Skater or Willie!

35:20.930 --> 35:22.764
I'll be with you.

35:23.402 --> 35:26.269
I want to break away from these people.

35:26.269 --> 35:29.288
Lady, you are these people.

35:38.747 --> 35:40.118
Well...

35:41.481 --> 35:42.812
That was a bold move.

35:42.812 --> 35:44.933
Might've worked in Albania.

35:45.939 --> 35:48.593
Don't tell me you still think
that she's on your side.

35:48.593 --> 35:49.882
She's scared.

35:49.882 --> 35:52.246
She's afraid of Ditmir.
We were running away from all this.

35:52.246 --> 35:53.972
Willie, this isn't a sitcom.

35:53.972 --> 35:56.725
How do you think Ditmir ended up
at the airport this morning,

35:56.725 --> 35:58.754
telepathy?

36:01.040 --> 36:02.471
You heard her.

36:02.471 --> 36:04.026
Ditmir pimped her out,

36:04.026 --> 36:07.870
first to Skater and then to you.

36:08.098 --> 36:11.828
If you hadn't taken the bait,
your buddy'd still be alive today.

36:11.828 --> 36:13.621
That's not what happened!

36:13.621 --> 36:15.769
Well, what did happen?

36:20.029 --> 36:22.042
Off the record?

36:23.755 --> 36:25.475
For now.

36:26.383 --> 36:27.699
Okay.

36:28.986 --> 36:30.841
Skater blew it.

36:30.841 --> 36:32.770
He betrayed me and them.

36:32.770 --> 36:35.441
I got Ditmir to hand him
a grand a week finder's fee

36:35.441 --> 36:37.012
just to stay out of their way.

36:37.012 --> 36:39.588
And there's Skater, he's selling
from his stupid truck,

36:39.588 --> 36:41.761
side-dealing to Chibueze.

36:41.761 --> 36:43.551
He should have just gone
to ball games.

36:43.551 --> 36:44.822
So that's why they killed him.

36:44.822 --> 36:46.643
They tolerated him
until a month ago

36:46.643 --> 36:50.249
when he posted all of my Christmas
releases on some chat board.

36:50.249 --> 36:52.163
Darknet.

36:52.886 --> 36:55.221
The Albanians lost their exclusive,

36:55.221 --> 36:57.645
and Skater lost his life.

36:57.645 --> 36:59.420
Betrayal.

36:59.420 --> 37:00.849
It's a blood offense.

37:00.849 --> 37:03.298
Skater never listened!

37:03.590 --> 37:05.514
He never learned.

37:06.019 --> 37:08.160
He never outgrew his part.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.393
By going on the darknet,

37:09.393 --> 37:13.363
he got back at Ditmir,
the studio, and at you.

37:14.677 --> 37:17.668
What do you think could make
a little nerd like Skater

37:17.668 --> 37:20.958
mad enough to get even with everyone?

37:22.120 --> 37:25.816
Could it be that you
took away his girlfriend?

37:25.816 --> 37:27.355
She wanted to be with me.

37:27.355 --> 37:31.963
What was it about Skater's girlfriend
that you had to have?

37:32.638 --> 37:36.974
On the show, if Skater liked a girl,
she'd end up with Kirk.

37:36.974 --> 37:38.682
What was the line?

37:38.682 --> 37:41.737
"What's yours is mine, Skatinsky!"

37:48.430 --> 37:51.102
You never outgrew your part either.

37:51.510 --> 37:53.670
She loved me.

37:53.670 --> 37:56.277
Hey, look, I'm Kirk.

37:56.277 --> 37:58.018
He's Skater.

37:58.018 --> 38:00.865
I, I took care of him.
I got him cash.

38:00.865 --> 38:02.772
I get the girl.

38:06.576 --> 38:08.887
I get the girl!

38:09.317 --> 38:11.482
When Skater posted on the darknet,

38:11.482 --> 38:13.667
that was his death wish.

38:13.667 --> 38:16.159
You killed him, not Ditmir.

38:16.159 --> 38:17.665
I...

38:17.665 --> 38:20.739
Look, I tried
to look after him. I did.

38:20.739 --> 38:22.599
But these guys...

38:22.986 --> 38:26.581
I didn't even know about it
until Ditmir showed me Skater's noose.

38:26.581 --> 38:29.623
These guys, we're gonna need you
to testify against them.

38:29.623 --> 38:31.905
No, no. I said it was off the record.

38:31.905 --> 38:33.344
Hey, Willie.

38:33.344 --> 38:34.990
They killed your buddy.

38:34.990 --> 38:36.981
You gotta do the right thing.

38:36.981 --> 38:39.030
Against Ditmir?

38:39.030 --> 38:40.897
But where am I gonna hide?

38:40.897 --> 38:42.240
Witness protection.

38:42.240 --> 38:44.202
Witness protection?

38:44.202 --> 38:47.041
Do, do you get the extent of my fame?

38:47.041 --> 38:51.686
I, I have over 129,000
google references!

38:51.686 --> 38:52.806
You counted?

38:52.806 --> 38:55.736
What am I gonna do,
run the small-town framing shop?

38:55.736 --> 38:59.485
I mean, this face does not blend in.

38:59.485 --> 39:03.348
They're doing amazing, amazing things
with plastic surgery today.

39:03.348 --> 39:04.695
No!

39:04.965 --> 39:06.303
No!

39:06.564 --> 39:08.640
I am Kirk!

39:08.847 --> 39:10.428
The Kirkster!

39:10.428 --> 39:13.670
I get to walk down the street
and have people shout at me,

39:13.670 --> 39:15.864
"hey, you used to be Kirk!"

39:15.864 --> 39:17.624
And I shout right back at them,

39:17.624 --> 39:20.828
"that's right, baby.
I still am!"

39:20.828 --> 39:23.036
"24/7!"

39:29.900 --> 39:32.950
You wouldn't understand.

39:33.621 --> 39:35.192
I get it.

39:35.192 --> 39:38.835
You never know when someone's
gonna push a napkin at you to autograph

39:38.835 --> 39:42.686
or ask you to scream,
"give me el breako!"

39:44.311 --> 39:45.867
Yeah.

39:46.767 --> 39:48.938
Yeah, like that.

39:49.665 --> 39:52.527
You ever wonder what it'd be like
to let that all go,

39:52.527 --> 39:55.042
no Kirk to lug around?

40:03.132 --> 40:06.963
Okay, make yourself beautiful.
You're going into a lineup.

40:07.793 --> 40:08.914
I've been before,

40:08.914 --> 40:11.632
but for some reason,
no one ever picks me.

40:21.927 --> 40:24.220
He, he knows I'm in here.

40:24.220 --> 40:28.574
It's one-way, Willie, like on TV.

40:33.487 --> 40:36.752
We'll take care of you.
He'll never find you.

40:37.940 --> 40:40.210
It's number two.

40:40.210 --> 40:44.388
He told me he killed Skater.
He showed me the noose he used.

40:51.648 --> 40:53.512
Ditmir.

40:54.447 --> 40:56.527
Stick around.

40:58.311 --> 41:00.540
Tough luck, huh?

41:01.481 --> 41:03.424
For you too.

41:03.608 --> 41:06.212
Why? Am I in blood now?

41:06.951 --> 41:08.719
That's right.

41:18.624 --> 41:20.773
You did the right thing, Willie.

41:20.773 --> 41:22.928
Oh, Willie...

41:23.355 --> 41:25.862
Willie's gone.

41:26.180 --> 41:28.486
So's Kirk.

41:30.711 --> 41:32.957
And how do you feel?

41:36.309 --> 41:39.489
I've never felt more relieved
in my whole life.
