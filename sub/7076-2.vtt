WEBVTT

00:00.887 --> 00:03.152
By the end of WWII President Roosevelt

00:03.272 --> 00:05.510
had finally succumbed
to the polio

00:05.630 --> 00:09.977
that afflicted him
his entire life.

00:10.012 --> 00:12.380
Which brings me to
the Yalta Conference.

00:12.414 --> 00:14.532
Who can tell me three
key points brought up there?

00:14.583 --> 00:15.950
Annie.

00:16.018 --> 00:17.018
The demilitarization
of Germany--

00:17.052 --> 00:18.019
I'm sorry.

00:18.053 --> 00:20.004
Annie Kim.

00:20.038 --> 00:21.939
The demilitarization
of Germany,

00:21.974 --> 00:23.324
the establishment
of Poland's borders

00:23.358 --> 00:25.159
and the formation of
the United Nations.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.528
Side note: The results
of Yalta would later

00:27.563 --> 00:29.196
set the stage for the Cold War.

00:29.231 --> 00:31.332
Oh, boy, spoiler alert.

00:31.366 --> 00:36.270
Somebody just won
a ride in the wheelchair.

00:36.305 --> 00:38.189
I'm proud of you
for deciding on a major, Britta.

00:38.223 --> 00:39.640
I'd like to thank the lord
in my prayers about you,

00:39.674 --> 00:41.726
but you're still dressing
like a streetwalker.

00:41.777 --> 00:43.027
Yep, I'm getting serious.

00:43.061 --> 00:45.196
I got a backpack,
I got a new notebook.

00:45.230 --> 00:47.231
Oh, I got one of
those see-through yellow pens

00:47.282 --> 00:49.066
so I can do that thing
where you color in the words.

00:49.117 --> 00:50.234
Highlight?

00:50.285 --> 00:51.702
Probably the backpack.

00:51.737 --> 00:52.987
Free the damascus three.

00:53.021 --> 00:55.656
Oh, thanks.
Oh, whoa.

00:55.690 --> 00:56.791
I know this girl.

00:56.825 --> 00:58.459
We used to protest together
all the time

00:58.493 --> 01:00.361
and now she's locked up
in Syria.

01:00.379 --> 01:01.579
Oh, that's terrible.

01:01.630 --> 01:02.964
Yes, it's terrible.

01:02.998 --> 01:04.715
She's imprisoned
by an oppressive regime

01:04.750 --> 01:06.968
halfway around the world
and I'm, what?

01:07.002 --> 01:08.252
In college?

01:08.303 --> 01:10.304
Where are my values?

01:10.339 --> 01:13.641
Man, she's got
a Facebook group?

01:13.675 --> 01:15.977
My first cop flashlight.

01:16.011 --> 01:19.230
Can't wait to get some brains
on this bad boy.

01:19.264 --> 01:20.948
Are you safe, ma'am?
Everything okay?

01:20.983 --> 01:22.383
Is this guy bothering you?

01:22.417 --> 01:23.985
- Huh? Huh?
- Hey!

01:24.019 --> 01:25.552
Who the hell
do you think you are?

01:25.570 --> 01:27.154
The badge says
to serve and protect!

01:27.189 --> 01:28.773
No, it doesn't.

01:28.824 --> 01:32.460
"How's my smile?"
Oh, man.

01:32.494 --> 01:34.278
What the hell am I
in charge of?

01:34.329 --> 01:35.896
See this garbage can?

01:35.914 --> 01:38.232
Students coming out
of the library bump into it.

01:38.250 --> 01:40.501
You can serve and protect them
from a nasty boo-boo.

01:40.535 --> 01:41.769
What do I do if I see a crime?

01:41.803 --> 01:43.771
What a security guard does--

01:43.805 --> 01:45.706
Call a cop.

01:45.740 --> 01:47.291
Where'd you even get these?

01:47.342 --> 01:48.843
- Come on, let me keep them.
- No.

01:48.877 --> 01:51.178
Please?
I swear they're just for sex!

Gang, this is Annie Kim
from my Poli-Sci class.

02:26.534 --> 02:28.869
We just figured out we had
the same G.P.A. in high school.

02:28.903 --> 02:31.438
Well, mine was higher if you
consider my school's ranking.

02:31.472 --> 02:33.607
Well, it sounds like you had
a lighter course load, so.

02:33.641 --> 02:34.708
Well, I was in a lot of clubs.

02:34.742 --> 02:36.109
I founded 17 of them.

02:36.144 --> 02:37.611
Well, I was actually thinking
about founding a model U.N.

02:37.645 --> 02:39.279
here at Greendale.
Any interest?

02:39.314 --> 02:40.747
I'll probably be busy,

02:40.782 --> 02:42.349
and you probably need to study,

02:42.383 --> 02:43.700
so see you in class.

02:43.751 --> 02:46.587
Okay, goodbye.

02:46.621 --> 02:48.488
Wow, Annie.

02:48.506 --> 02:50.857
How progressive of you to have
a multicultural evil twin.

02:50.892 --> 02:51.858
An Asian Annie.

02:51.893 --> 02:53.594
Obama's America.

02:53.628 --> 02:55.862
Her name is Annie Kim,

02:55.897 --> 02:56.897
and she's not evil.

02:56.931 --> 02:57.931
She's my friend.

02:57.966 --> 02:59.199
Didn't look like it.

02:59.234 --> 03:00.667
Yeah, you seemed pretty
competitive with her.

03:00.685 --> 03:02.869
You be careful, Annie.
They are ruthless.

03:02.904 --> 03:04.371
What?

03:04.405 --> 03:06.172
What? Not Asians.

03:06.190 --> 03:07.190
Women.

03:07.225 --> 03:08.742
I'm not competing with her.

03:08.776 --> 03:10.176
I find her adorable.

03:10.194 --> 03:11.511
She's like a younger me.

03:11.546 --> 03:13.063
You mean the younger you
that took so much Adderall

03:13.114 --> 03:14.514
she tried to straighten
the lines on our high school

03:14.532 --> 03:15.882
football field during a game?

03:15.917 --> 03:17.351
Ooh, be careful, Annie.

03:17.385 --> 03:18.385
You don't want this little girl

03:18.419 --> 03:19.720
to suck you back
to the dark side.

03:19.754 --> 03:21.888
Hey, guys,
what're you trying to do here?

03:21.923 --> 03:23.189
This is our Annie.

03:23.207 --> 03:25.592
That little twerp
is a can of Annie lite.

03:25.627 --> 03:27.127
She couldn't hold a candle
to the real thing

03:27.161 --> 03:30.130
in any category of anything.

03:30.164 --> 03:31.531
Aw, well, I wasn't
fishing for that.

03:31.566 --> 03:34.101
You're the best, kiddo.

03:34.135 --> 03:35.102
You know what else
was the best?

03:35.136 --> 03:36.336
The rainforests.

03:36.370 --> 03:38.672
Too bad the fascist oligarchies
are raping them

03:38.706 --> 03:42.142
to make hamburgers.
Look it up.

03:43.811 --> 03:45.779
Looks like someone woke up
on the regular side of the bed.

03:45.813 --> 03:47.347
Britta's just having
a rough time

03:47.382 --> 03:49.149
because her friend's in prison.

03:49.183 --> 03:50.417
I went to her Facebook page.

03:50.451 --> 03:53.387
It says she was tear-gassed
and possibly beaten.

03:53.421 --> 03:55.989
I haven't been tear-gassed
in so long.

03:56.024 --> 03:57.574
Well, you're on a new path now.

03:57.608 --> 03:59.926
Oh, goody, a new path.

03:59.961 --> 04:03.330
Is it lined with credit cards
and flat screen TVs?

04:03.364 --> 04:05.465
Does it go by an Ikea?

04:05.500 --> 04:06.833
Maybe I don't want a new path!

04:06.868 --> 04:07.918
Or any path.

04:07.952 --> 04:10.587
Maybe my path is a war path

04:10.621 --> 04:14.541
that leads
to the terrordome, n-words!

04:14.575 --> 04:16.942
Okay, maybe I went too far.

04:16.978 --> 04:19.411
Maybe I don't want to offend
my African-American friends,

04:19.430 --> 04:21.298
but the larger point is,

04:21.349 --> 04:26.436
maybe I'm not done
raging against the machine.

04:26.471 --> 04:27.454
Raging against the what?

04:27.488 --> 04:28.622
That sounds dangerous.

04:28.656 --> 04:31.158
Don't worry.
She'll be bad at it.

04:31.192 --> 04:33.110
Keep clear of the can.

04:33.144 --> 04:37.564
Sir, step around the can.

05:37.708 --> 05:40.861
Hi.

You okay, kiddo?

05:42.563 --> 05:44.464
Yeah, yeah.
You know what's funny?

05:44.499 --> 05:45.599
This is so silly.

05:45.633 --> 05:47.601
Remember little Annie Kim
from Poli-Sci?

05:47.635 --> 05:49.803
Boy, she just...
took my model U.N. idea

05:49.837 --> 05:52.222
and just...

05:52.273 --> 05:53.840
She is quite
the little go-getter.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.442
Wait, what?

05:55.476 --> 05:56.560
She stole your idea?

05:56.611 --> 05:57.727
Sneak attack.

05:57.779 --> 05:59.613
That's just like--

05:59.647 --> 06:01.615
Not women, Asians.

06:01.649 --> 06:04.151
Well, the real important thing
is that there is a model U.N.

06:04.185 --> 06:06.153
It doesn't really matter
who starts it.

06:06.187 --> 06:08.221
It just means her name
goes on some charter

06:08.256 --> 06:10.207
and she gets to put it
on her résumé.

06:10.241 --> 06:13.126
And lead the Greendale team
to the national model U.N.,

06:13.161 --> 06:16.362
and meet Kofi Annan, Boutros
Boutros Ghali, and Will.I.Am.

06:16.380 --> 06:18.381
Boutros Boutros Ghali?

06:18.416 --> 06:20.467
I'm gonna find
this little brat's off-switch.

06:20.501 --> 06:21.534
Jeff!

06:21.552 --> 06:23.036
He's just being protective.

06:23.054 --> 06:24.721
I'll stop him.

06:24.755 --> 06:26.740
I am so excited that
we finally have a model U.N.

06:26.774 --> 06:28.041
here at Greendale.

06:28.075 --> 06:29.776
I am really, really, really,
really, really, really

06:29.811 --> 06:31.044
into model U.N.s.

06:31.078 --> 06:32.913
They used to call me model U.N.
guy back in college.

06:32.947 --> 06:36.216
Well, that's not--
don't research that.

06:36.234 --> 06:38.985
The important thing here
is that I am really--

06:39.020 --> 06:40.821
Pardon me, Professor Cligoris.

06:40.855 --> 06:42.239
Cligoris?

06:42.273 --> 06:44.591
Either pronunciation is fine?
Are you here for the model U.N.?

06:44.625 --> 06:46.960
I'm here to tell you
that the entire idea

06:46.994 --> 06:49.946
to have a model U.N.
was hers.

06:49.997 --> 06:52.732
Really? So you're
Clark M. Eichelburger.

06:52.767 --> 06:55.168
So I've had your photo around my
neck since I was in high school.

06:55.203 --> 06:56.770
I'm talking about
the Greendale model U.N.

06:56.804 --> 07:00.841
My Annie gave
this other Annie the idea

07:00.875 --> 07:02.409
and the diabolical
little b--usybody

07:02.443 --> 07:04.044
stabbed her in the back.

07:04.078 --> 07:05.378
It's childish.

07:05.413 --> 07:07.781
Honestly I'm just happy
there is a model U.N.

07:07.815 --> 07:08.982
Annie, is this true?

07:09.016 --> 07:12.919
I recall other Annie
mentioned the concept,

07:12.954 --> 07:14.420
but she certainly
didn't take the initiative

07:14.438 --> 07:16.456
to find a faculty advisor.

07:16.491 --> 07:18.058
I didn't know that all you had
to do was call dibs.

07:18.092 --> 07:19.226
I'm not calling dibs.

07:19.260 --> 07:20.810
Because I'm not a petty
competitive child

07:20.862 --> 07:22.479
that steals ideas.

07:22.530 --> 07:24.531
I simply refuse to acknowledge
the authority

07:24.565 --> 07:26.099
of your criminal model U.N.

07:26.133 --> 07:27.234
So don't recognize it.

07:27.268 --> 07:28.468
It still exists.

07:28.503 --> 07:30.937
Oh, then Annie'll just
start her own model U.N.

07:30.955 --> 07:32.105
Yeah, for grown-ups.

07:32.139 --> 07:33.473
Well, I still don't
recognize it.

07:33.508 --> 07:35.308
Well, it exists, baby!

07:35.343 --> 07:36.576
I'm sorry, I don't understand
your relationship here.

07:36.611 --> 07:38.211
Is he your father
or your lover?

07:38.246 --> 07:39.496
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:39.547 --> 07:40.614
There can only be one
model U.N.

07:40.648 --> 07:42.082
that officially represents
this school

07:42.116 --> 07:43.717
so let's take our foot
off the crazy pedal

07:43.751 --> 07:44.985
for just a moment here.

07:45.019 --> 07:46.953
There's only one rational way
to settle this.

07:46.988 --> 07:49.723
A head-to-head model U.N.
Battle Royale,

07:49.757 --> 07:55.028
the rules to which I would have
to spend the evening devising.

07:55.062 --> 07:56.730
We'll have the competition
tomorrow

07:56.764 --> 07:58.198
in the cafeteria
at 7:00 P.M.

07:58.232 --> 08:00.734
May the most United Nations win.

08:00.768 --> 08:02.235
- Fair enough.
- Totally fair.

08:02.270 --> 08:04.971
I'll see you in the fair papers,
other Annie.

08:04.989 --> 08:07.490
Oh, and you were asking
what our relationship is?

08:07.525 --> 08:08.692
- We're friends.
- Yeah.

08:08.743 --> 08:10.076
- Good friends.
- Grown-up friends.

08:10.111 --> 08:11.077
- Yeah.
- So.

08:14.916 --> 08:16.349
We're friendly.

08:19.632 --> 08:21.868
So, the key to winning this thing is

08:21.988 --> 08:23.689
when in doubt,
agree with Annie.

08:23.723 --> 08:24.723
That's sweet, Jeff.

08:24.758 --> 08:26.175
But everyone should
just have fun.

08:26.226 --> 08:27.860
Then again, what's more fun
than winning?

08:30.313 --> 08:31.397
Pierce.

08:31.431 --> 08:33.131
I'm offended you would
single me out.

08:33.166 --> 08:34.633
Did you read up on
your country's info-packet?

08:34.668 --> 08:35.701
Yes.

08:35.735 --> 08:37.870
Somalia has 1,900 miles
of coastline,

08:37.904 --> 08:39.205
a government that
knows its place,

08:39.239 --> 08:41.440
and all the guns and wives
you can afford to buy.

08:41.474 --> 08:43.375
Why have I never heard
of this paradise before?

08:43.409 --> 08:44.643
I studied up on my country.

08:44.678 --> 08:47.213
Is it okay if
we do accents, sugar?

08:47.247 --> 08:49.715
Troy, Georgia the country,
not the state.

08:49.749 --> 08:51.650
That's right.
Capital city Tbilisi,

08:51.668 --> 08:53.319
and former member
of the Soviet Union.

08:53.353 --> 08:56.222
And we kindly request y'all
mind your Ps and Qs.

08:56.256 --> 08:58.307
Welcome to the world's
first ever model U.N.-off.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.827
You will each be scored
on your U.N.'s ability

09:01.862 --> 09:07.366
to pass resolutions, follow
procedure, and maintain order.

09:07.400 --> 09:10.970
The end goal, of course,
total world peace.

09:11.004 --> 09:12.404
Any questions?

09:12.439 --> 09:14.173
Does two U.N.s mean
there are two earths?

09:14.207 --> 09:16.675
Uh, yeah.
Sure, two earths.

09:16.710 --> 09:18.210
Parallel earths
in different galaxies

09:18.245 --> 09:19.912
or identical earths
in parallel dimensions?

09:19.946 --> 09:21.013
The latter one.

09:21.047 --> 09:22.197
Well, what does that say
about free will?

09:22.232 --> 09:23.215
Abed! Professor--

09:23.250 --> 09:24.350
Right, yeah, let's begin.

09:24.384 --> 09:25.734
Ready, set,

09:25.785 --> 09:26.752
peace.

09:26.786 --> 09:28.120
Crisis alert.

09:28.154 --> 09:30.856
A civil war has broken out
in Ethiopia.

09:30.891 --> 09:33.726
Rebel forces have seized
the grain supply,

09:33.760 --> 09:35.461
creating
a humanitarian disaster.

09:35.495 --> 09:37.196
Okay, cool heads, everyone.

09:37.230 --> 09:40.032
America proposes a U.N.
peacekeeping force of

09:40.066 --> 09:41.066
10,000 troops.

09:41.101 --> 09:42.067
Uruguay agrees.

09:42.102 --> 09:43.369
Ooh, uh, China, too.

09:43.403 --> 09:46.405
Georgia--the country--
is much obliged.

09:46.439 --> 09:48.374
There's gonna be refugees.
Who can take refugees?

09:48.408 --> 09:49.875
The great country of Somalia.

09:49.910 --> 09:51.977
This gem,
this Shangri-La

09:52.012 --> 09:54.413
graciously invites
the Ethiopian refugees

09:54.447 --> 09:57.816
to enjoy safe lodging
and cool ocean breezes

09:57.851 --> 09:59.251
on its sand-swept beaches.

09:59.286 --> 10:00.436
Okay, we're rolling.

10:00.487 --> 10:01.437
Switzerland proposes
a peace summit.

10:01.488 --> 10:02.888
Good idea, Switzerland.

10:02.923 --> 10:04.389
And maybe at the peace summit
we can discuss the possibility

10:04.407 --> 10:05.724
of opening a portal
to Earth II.

10:05.742 --> 10:07.526
Can we put a pin
in that, Switzerland?

10:07.560 --> 10:08.961
Earth II is out there,
can't ignore it forever.

10:08.995 --> 10:11.096
Well, China has money.
Does anybody want some?

10:11.131 --> 10:13.732
Yes! The United States
proposes using China's money

10:13.767 --> 10:15.417
to fund agricultural programs

10:15.452 --> 10:18.604
to support Ethiopia's
sustainable farms.

10:18.638 --> 10:20.839
Which should promote economic
development and security.

10:20.874 --> 10:22.408
All in favor?

10:22.442 --> 10:23.943
It's unanimous.

10:23.977 --> 10:25.177
Good resolving,
blue U.N.

10:25.211 --> 10:26.679
You really covered
all the bases.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.681
We have a unanimous decision
as well.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.816
Then after one round,
we are tied.

10:30.850 --> 10:34.486
Looks like both U.N.s
are experts at fostering unity.

10:34.521 --> 10:35.821
- Crap.
- Damn it.

10:35.855 --> 10:37.022
Crisis alert. Russia...

10:37.057 --> 10:38.791
This is what the United Nations

10:38.825 --> 10:40.109
is doing to your freedom.

10:40.143 --> 10:43.479
I'm your freedom!
And I'm in a cage.

10:43.530 --> 10:45.364
With the world!

10:45.398 --> 10:46.865
Because of them!

10:46.900 --> 10:48.300
I thought I'd find you here.

10:48.335 --> 10:50.769
What are you gonna do,
lock me up?

10:50.787 --> 10:51.837
Just give me a reason.

10:51.871 --> 10:54.490
I'll give you a reason!

10:55.575 --> 10:56.542
Whoa!

10:58.712 --> 11:00.329
That's it,
you're coming with me.

11:00.380 --> 11:02.948
♪ Hello ♪

11:02.966 --> 11:06.885
♪ is it me you're looking for ♪

11:06.920 --> 11:08.253
He's pulling my cage.

11:08.287 --> 11:10.305
I'm being pulled in my cage
for no reason!

11:10.340 --> 11:11.557
Is anybody seeing this?

11:11.591 --> 11:14.059
Is the world seeing this?
Are we facebooking this?

11:14.094 --> 11:16.895
Crisis alert!
A tsunami has hit Vietnam.

11:16.930 --> 11:18.998
Massive--crisis alert,
famine in Ghana--

11:19.032 --> 11:21.800
crisis alert--tuberculosis
outbreak--crisis alert!

11:21.851 --> 11:23.519
Humanitarian aid.
We further resolve--

11:23.570 --> 11:25.037
- Disarmament treaty.
- Crisis alert!

11:25.071 --> 11:26.438
To help women and children
get through famines.

11:26.472 --> 11:27.472
Save the orphans.

11:27.490 --> 11:28.490
Loose nukes--

11:28.525 --> 11:29.808
sinkhole--
North Korea--

11:29.826 --> 11:31.527
the prime minister in exile!
Military coup!

11:31.578 --> 11:34.530
The tropical paradise
of Somalia graciously yields.

11:34.581 --> 11:35.864
- China will pay.
- Gooder than grits.

11:35.915 --> 11:37.249
Switzerland is very concerned
about Earth II.

11:37.283 --> 11:38.316
Uruguay agrees.

11:38.334 --> 11:39.451
Uruguay sounds
like "you're a gay."

11:39.485 --> 11:40.986
Backyard barbecue!

11:41.021 --> 11:42.321
Uruguay kindly requests that

11:42.355 --> 11:44.673
Somalia stop pronouncing it
"you're a gay."

11:44.708 --> 11:46.291
- Hereditary monarchy!
- Resolved.

11:46.325 --> 11:48.260
- Graft and corruption.
- Resolved.

11:48.294 --> 11:49.378
Crisis alert!

11:49.429 --> 11:50.379
Resolved.

11:50.430 --> 11:51.864
Looking good, blue U.N.

11:51.898 --> 11:53.899
Getting very close
to world peace.

11:53.933 --> 11:56.035
That's my girl.
You are kicking ass.

11:56.069 --> 11:57.352
All right, guys,

11:57.387 --> 11:59.772
this is the home stretch.
All we gotta do is focus.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.523
Oh! Damn, Pierce.

12:01.558 --> 12:02.841
Ooh, that wasn't me.

12:02.876 --> 12:04.877
I don't smell anything--
whup, I just got it.

12:04.911 --> 12:06.278
Oh, it's in my mouth.

12:06.312 --> 12:07.563
Guys, come on, focus.

12:07.614 --> 12:09.048
Like adults.

12:09.082 --> 12:10.949
We're gonna lose a point
if we don't get through this.

12:10.984 --> 12:13.052
Get through it?
It's almost a solid.

12:13.086 --> 12:14.686
Crisis alert.

12:14.721 --> 12:16.622
A genocidal dictator
in Laos--

12:16.656 --> 12:18.724
Yeah, yeah, we'll get to that.

12:18.758 --> 12:21.210
Okay, so, looking at Turkey,
what can you do?

12:21.244 --> 12:23.095
So let me get this straight.

12:23.129 --> 12:24.797
You're bringing her in here

12:24.831 --> 12:27.299
for "making a mess."

12:27.333 --> 12:28.634
I did more than make a mess.

12:28.668 --> 12:30.602
I turned your whole system
inside out.

12:30.637 --> 12:32.271
And I shut her down.

12:32.305 --> 12:33.639
Young lady, you spilled paint
on a globe.

12:33.673 --> 12:35.607
You're as much a criminal
as this idiot is a cop.

12:35.642 --> 12:36.975
None whatsoever.

12:37.010 --> 12:40.412
Okay, but, um, she's going
to do something illegal.

12:40.447 --> 12:41.447
Aren't you?

12:41.481 --> 12:43.615
Is that true?
Do you, Britta Perry,

12:43.650 --> 12:46.485
have any intentions
of breaking any laws ever?

12:46.519 --> 12:47.986
I-I-

12:48.021 --> 12:49.988
Oh, my God.

12:50.023 --> 12:51.990
No, it's not that simple.

12:52.025 --> 12:54.126
I have a life now.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.561
I have a major and--

12:55.595 --> 12:56.561
Get out please.

12:56.579 --> 12:58.497
I have highlighters.

12:58.531 --> 13:02.901
Get out!

13:02.936 --> 13:05.771
Okay, I know you've got a lot
on your mind right now.

13:05.805 --> 13:08.373
But somebody broke that thing

13:08.408 --> 13:09.975
that comes down
from the parking booth.

13:10.009 --> 13:12.411
You know the thing
that comes down,

13:12.445 --> 13:15.280
keeps the...cars
from coming in.

13:15.315 --> 13:17.783
The thing. It's like a gate,
but it's just a stick.

13:17.817 --> 13:20.085
Comes down, from a hinge.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.720
Keeps the cars out.

13:21.754 --> 13:24.022
Goes up and down 90 degrees.

13:24.057 --> 13:25.657
The arm?

13:28.194 --> 13:31.263
Ooh, point goes to red team.

13:31.297 --> 13:32.531
How is this still happening?

13:32.565 --> 13:34.933
I can't remember what
regular air smells like.

13:34.968 --> 13:37.369
Do something or
we're gonna lose.

13:37.403 --> 13:41.507
Guys, this is important
to Annie.

13:41.541 --> 13:43.675
So whoever actually died
a few months ago, 'fess up

13:43.710 --> 13:44.877
so we can put a stake
through your heart.

13:46.045 --> 13:47.012
Jeff!

13:47.046 --> 13:48.113
Annie, I think
the real lesson here is

13:48.131 --> 13:49.648
that a model U.N.,
much like the real U.N.,

13:49.682 --> 13:51.633
quickly falls apart
when faced with actual--

13:51.668 --> 13:54.987
Noooooo!

13:55.021 --> 13:59.892
I think the lesson here
is that I need to win this!

13:59.926 --> 14:02.177
I want to win!

14:02.228 --> 14:03.345
And you!

14:03.396 --> 14:07.816
You suck!
You're a stupid, ugly poopface!

14:07.851 --> 14:10.335
I'm better than you!

14:10.370 --> 14:11.803
Annie, stop.

14:11.821 --> 14:13.305
You're acting
like a little schoolgirl

14:13.339 --> 14:14.573
and not in a hot way.

14:23.349 --> 14:25.367
Okay.

14:25.418 --> 14:27.419
Uh, that made me sound creepy.

14:27.453 --> 14:29.538
But--but here's the thing.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.684
Don't look at me.

14:45.054 --> 14:48.218
If embarrassment were
bountiful zinc deposits,

14:48.252 --> 14:49.469
I'd be Zambia.

14:49.520 --> 14:53.356
There's nothing
to be Zambia about, Annie.

14:53.391 --> 14:55.241
This is all my fault.

14:55.276 --> 14:57.260
I pushed you into competing
with other Annie.

14:57.278 --> 14:58.461
Are you kidding me?

14:58.496 --> 15:00.930
I practically ran to you
with that flier.

15:00.965 --> 15:02.866
I wanted to destroy her.

15:02.900 --> 15:04.334
All because I can't handle
the thought

15:04.368 --> 15:06.319
of anyone getting
more gold stars than me.

15:06.370 --> 15:08.438
I'm such a child.

15:08.472 --> 15:10.774
You're not.

15:10.808 --> 15:13.276
Listen, when you really
hate someone

15:13.310 --> 15:15.211
the way you hate Annie Kim,

15:15.246 --> 15:18.882
or when you feel
the way I feel about you,

15:18.916 --> 15:23.169
the easy loophole through
the creepiness and danger

15:23.220 --> 15:24.504
is to treat them like a child.

15:24.555 --> 15:26.673
"A chip off the old block,
you're the best, kiddo."

15:26.724 --> 15:28.091
It's a crutch.

15:28.125 --> 15:31.678
It's a way for me to tell you
how important you are

15:31.729 --> 15:33.563
from a distance.

15:33.597 --> 15:36.366
But now you're becoming this...

15:36.400 --> 15:38.868
mature, self-possessed,
intelligent young woman,

15:38.903 --> 15:40.737
and I can't keep
patting you on the head

15:40.771 --> 15:41.804
or talking down to you.

15:41.822 --> 15:44.407
But I like how close we are.

15:44.442 --> 15:47.010
I don't want to grow up if
it means losing what we have.

15:47.044 --> 15:48.445
Well, tough, Annie.

15:48.479 --> 15:51.414
You have to grow up because the
world needs more women like you.

15:51.449 --> 15:54.684
Can't keep doing
this forever, kiddo.

15:54.718 --> 15:57.854
Can't we?

16:02.693 --> 16:03.843
- Nope. I can't, no.
- Nope, that's gross.

16:03.878 --> 16:06.546
That feels gross.

16:06.597 --> 16:08.932
Well, I better go
check on the group.

16:08.966 --> 16:10.183
If they haven't left already.

16:10.217 --> 16:11.234
I'll follow you.

16:11.268 --> 16:13.019
From a respectable distance.

16:17.274 --> 16:18.975
Guys?

16:19.009 --> 16:21.010
I'm sorry I put you
through that.

16:21.045 --> 16:22.579
And I know it doesn't make up
for what happened,

16:22.613 --> 16:25.782
but would it help if I said

16:25.816 --> 16:27.917
I farted?

16:27.952 --> 16:30.019
Annie, no.

16:30.054 --> 16:32.155
I can't let you fall
on that sword because...

16:32.189 --> 16:33.790
I farted.

16:33.824 --> 16:35.208
No, I farted.

16:35.242 --> 16:36.626
I farted.

16:36.660 --> 16:38.228
Guys, I wasn't doing
the <i>Spartacus</i> thing.

16:38.262 --> 16:39.229
I farted.

16:39.263 --> 16:40.230
No, seriously, I--

16:40.264 --> 16:41.264
We all farted.

16:41.298 --> 16:44.434
Oh, you guys!

16:44.468 --> 16:45.969
- Annie...
- I'm farting now.

16:46.003 --> 16:47.370
Wait, why are you still here?

16:47.388 --> 16:49.472
Abed may have figured out
a way we can still win.

16:49.507 --> 16:50.640
Really? How?

16:50.674 --> 16:52.058
It's simple, really.
First we...

16:55.262 --> 16:56.262
Abed, what did I tell you?

16:56.313 --> 16:57.280
You can't just mumble nonsense.

16:57.314 --> 16:58.448
No one's cutting away.

16:58.482 --> 17:00.717
Okay, fine,
here's my actual plan.

17:18.868 --> 17:19.836
What is that?

17:19.869 --> 17:21.204
It's from Britta.

17:21.238 --> 17:24.740
She's promising to disrupt
the model...U.N.

17:24.758 --> 17:27.143
She says she's gonna cause
a disruption that,

17:27.176 --> 17:29.679
while not completely illegal,
should be a real concern

17:29.713 --> 17:32.282
to campus...Security!

17:32.316 --> 17:34.133
Oh, no.

17:34.184 --> 17:37.287
Maybe we should call
the real cops.

17:37.321 --> 17:38.888
You know, back in the '80s,

17:38.923 --> 17:41.057
I had this real
piece of work protestor,

17:41.091 --> 17:42.659
used to always give me trouble.

17:42.693 --> 17:44.661
You know what happened to her?

17:44.695 --> 17:47.263
She incited a riot
at the W.T.O.

17:47.298 --> 17:50.533
Got choked
until she passed out.

17:50.568 --> 17:55.271
By some real cop
with a real billyclub.

17:57.908 --> 18:01.945
Sometimes I wonder, you know?

18:01.979 --> 18:04.113
Well, what are you waiting for?

18:04.148 --> 18:08.151
Go show that hippie
how the world really works.

18:10.287 --> 18:14.490
Aren't you
forgetting something?

18:14.525 --> 18:16.960
All in favor?

18:16.994 --> 18:18.194
Aye?

18:18.228 --> 18:20.680
Could you morons say aye
any slower? Come on.

18:32.376 --> 18:35.144
- Greetings, people of Earth II.
- What is this?

18:35.179 --> 18:37.547
We represent
the United Nations from Earth I.

18:37.581 --> 18:40.483
Using our Switzerland's
hadron collider

18:40.517 --> 18:41.951
and resources from
every nation,

18:41.986 --> 18:43.786
the people of our planet
have constructed

18:43.821 --> 18:45.722
a trans-dimensional
gateway here.

18:45.756 --> 18:47.040
They can't do this.

18:47.091 --> 18:48.891
The science works out.

18:48.926 --> 18:50.126
Yes.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.362
We come to you with an offer.

18:52.396 --> 18:54.364
We he achieved world peace,
tying our score with yours.

18:54.398 --> 18:56.165
But we are willing
to concede our victory

18:56.200 --> 18:58.468
if you agree conceding yours,

18:58.502 --> 19:02.538
forming one gigantic
United United Nations.

19:02.573 --> 19:03.606
We did it.

19:03.641 --> 19:04.907
You're a fool.

19:04.942 --> 19:07.910
Your ultimatum is itself
a technical act of aggression.

19:07.945 --> 19:10.880
If we simply refuse
to recognize your authority,

19:10.914 --> 19:14.083
we still remain ahead
and you lose.

19:14.118 --> 19:15.585
But you win a simple game.

19:15.619 --> 19:18.721
The larger symbolic victory
will be ours.

19:18.756 --> 19:20.890
Oh la la.

19:20.924 --> 19:21.991
We refuse.

19:22.026 --> 19:23.793
I'll take the real victory.

19:23.827 --> 19:28.264
A logical, effective,
common sense move, Annie Kim.

19:28.298 --> 19:30.767
One which flies in the very face
of the United Nations itself,

19:30.801 --> 19:34.137
a fundamentally symbolic
organization

19:34.171 --> 19:36.606
founded on the principles
of high-minded rhetoric

19:36.640 --> 19:37.607
and empty gestures.

19:37.641 --> 19:39.776
Blue U.N. wins.

19:48.819 --> 19:49.819
What the hell are you doing?

19:49.853 --> 19:50.987
Nothing.

19:51.021 --> 19:54.557
And you can't do anything
to stop me.

19:54.575 --> 19:57.610
Did someone say
"can't do anything"?
