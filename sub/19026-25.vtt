00:03.200 --> 00:06.431
<i>So here I am, sitting on a box</i>

00:06.520 --> 00:09.717
<i>in an empty apartment</i>
<i>with a dead dog,</i>

00:09.800 --> 00:12.633
<i>and a single tear on my cheek.</i>

00:12.720 --> 00:15.280
<i>I can't help but wonder</i>
<i>how I got to this place.</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:22.713
- Who are these guys?
- The last eight guys in the hospital

00:22.800 --> 00:26.713
who don't realise I suck at basketball.
So here's what's gonna happen.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.995
I finally mastered
my running hook shot, OK?

00:29.080 --> 00:31.548
So when we go to pick teams,
I'm gonna hit that shot.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.756
Then you say, "I'll take that guy."

00:33.840 --> 00:37.150
At which point,
Carla is gonna page me,

00:37.240 --> 00:39.117
and I'll say, "Crap, I gotta go."

00:39.200 --> 00:41.953
You go, "Damn, we just lost
the best player out here."

00:42.040 --> 00:46.591
There'll be eight guys who think I'm
good at sports and word will spread.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.319
When do you find time
to see your patients?

00:49.400 --> 00:53.473
- Between these thoughts.
- OK. Let's play some ball.

00:58.440 --> 01:00.476
I got that guy.

01:04.040 --> 01:07.271
<i>Elliot's boyfriend, Jake,</i>
<i>had given her confidence to do things</i>

01:07.360 --> 01:09.112
<i>she'd never been able to do before.</i>

01:09.200 --> 01:11.714
- OK, you ready to do this?
- You know it.

01:11.800 --> 01:15.395
<i>Like talking to people</i>
<i>while she's on the toilet.</i>

01:15.480 --> 01:18.040
OK. I know how comfortable
you are with Carla,

01:18.120 --> 01:20.554
so I'm gonna have her do the talking.
You say when.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.154
There's cheeks on the seat
and I'm feeling good.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.834
- Let's hear it.
- Hello, Elliot.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.195
How are you doing?

01:30.080 --> 01:31.957
She went out the window.

01:32.680 --> 01:35.035
Bob Kelso here before noon?

01:35.120 --> 01:37.873
They're either giving away
free doughnuts at the café,

01:37.960 --> 01:40.554
or there's an Asian prostitute
convention in the ICU.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.835
Is now the time I'm supposed
to be embarrassed

01:42.920 --> 01:45.514
because I like fine food
and Korean call girls?

01:45.600 --> 01:48.239
Write this down:
I'm old and I honestly don't care

01:48.320 --> 01:50.390
what people think about anything I do.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.508
That was me, folks.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.558
No, I'm here
because the budget's a mess.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.312
Ted's not making much headway.

01:57.400 --> 02:01.996
3-12 x 4-8-1 equals...

02:02.080 --> 02:04.992
Sir, it's not giving me the answer.

02:05.080 --> 02:07.275
It's a typewriter, you jackass!

02:07.360 --> 02:09.749
Oh, God, it's got my tie!

02:12.120 --> 02:15.271
Bob, this whole thing
is only gonna take a couple of days,

02:15.360 --> 02:17.555
so why not let Jordan do it?

02:17.640 --> 02:19.198
Yes, she is a member of the board,

02:19.280 --> 02:22.670
but that only gets her out of the house
once every couple of months or so.

02:22.760 --> 02:25.672
And I know she loves our son,
Jack, with all her heart,

02:25.760 --> 02:28.558
but I think spending every waking moment
with the child,

02:28.640 --> 02:31.950
I think...
I think it's starting to get to her.

02:35.040 --> 02:37.110
I hate you.

02:37.680 --> 02:39.989
So, what do you say there, Bobbo?

02:40.080 --> 02:43.231
Welcome aboard. This will be
your office for the next few days.

02:43.320 --> 02:47.552
- Ted, find someplace else to work.
- Oh, man! Not again!

02:48.360 --> 02:51.636
If you need some happy pills,
they're in the top drawer.

02:51.720 --> 02:55.759
- In this hellhole, I'll need a gun.
- Bottom left.

02:56.560 --> 02:59.518
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.830
Why are we lying in the parking lot?

03:06.160 --> 03:08.151
Your hook shot
knocked you unconscious,

03:08.240 --> 03:11.437
so I laid down next to you so everyone
would think we were chillin'.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.671
Oh, thanks, SCB. By the way,
I should tell you something:

03:14.760 --> 03:17.797
I found an apartment.
I'm moving out the day after tomorrow.

03:17.880 --> 03:21.236
- Wow.
- Yeah.

03:21.320 --> 03:25.199
- What does SCB mean?
- "Super Chocolate Bear".

03:25.280 --> 03:27.794
- I love it.
- I knew you would.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:41.280 --> 03:44.431
Someone stole a whole case of laxatives
from the supply closet.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.114
Don't look at me.
I'm as regular as rain.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.919
- Who wants a piece of pie?
- Who made it?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.592
Let's say my mom.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.399
<i>As a doctor, you get good</i>
<i>at piecing things together.</i>

03:54.480 --> 03:57.631
- Someone stole a case of laxatives.
- Who wants a piece of pie?

03:57.720 --> 03:58.914
<i>This one was obvious.</i>

03:59.000 --> 04:00.433
No, thank you.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.710
Free pie? Hell, yeah.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.478
I can't believe you two
have lived together for 12 years.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.835
Do you remember our first day together?

04:13.760 --> 04:17.149
Yo, they call me Chris One.
What's the dealio?

04:17.240 --> 04:20.994
Welcome to our lair. I'm an eighth-level
ogre magi with invisibility,

04:21.079 --> 04:22.638
and this is Randal.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.428
You were such a dork.

04:26.520 --> 04:29.432
- I'm glad nothing else is changing.
- This is the time of year

04:29.520 --> 04:32.751
where everybody leaves, but Turk's
got another year of residency.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.479
J.D. And I just took positions
as staff internists.

04:35.560 --> 04:38.074
- Was that what you wanted?
- There was a fellowship

04:38.160 --> 04:41.152
with this doctor over at County,
but it's a little over my head.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.710
So you took a fallback job
cos you were afraid to go for it?

04:44.800 --> 04:48.509
- Jake, is it?
- Yeah, it's...

04:48.600 --> 04:51.751
I know your name. I'm being
condescending. It's Jake, right?

04:51.840 --> 04:53.796
Look, no one here is settling.

04:53.880 --> 04:57.111
At Sacred Heart, you get to work
with some of the finest doctors.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.998
Out of my way!
I got a doozy of a two-sie!

05:01.800 --> 05:04.234
All right, then.
Before we jump into rounds,

05:04.320 --> 05:07.232
I see it's time for my
annual cologne intervention.

05:07.320 --> 05:10.790
Lonnie, you're killing us.
And, honestly, what's the point?

05:10.880 --> 05:13.474
No matter how badly you want
to get freaky with Karen,

05:13.560 --> 05:15.835
that's just not going to happen.
Here's why:

05:15.920 --> 05:19.310
She thinks you have
the body of a foetus.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.392
- Did you tell me that in confidence?
- No, he knows.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.038
She drew me a picture.

05:24.120 --> 05:27.396
Don't sweat it too much. He wore
so much cologne on our first date,

05:27.480 --> 05:30.074
- I had to sell my Miata.
- Why?

05:30.160 --> 05:33.152
- For funsies.
- Heel.

05:33.880 --> 05:36.474
- Thanks for that.
- Keep moving, foetus-face.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.197
Come here, boy! Come on, Rowdy!

05:42.280 --> 05:44.953
- No, you come here, eat your steak!
- What are you doing?

05:45.040 --> 05:46.996
Whoever Rowdy goes to gets to keep him.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.958
Rowdy, if you come to me,
I'll scratch your special region.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.429
So you moved back all the furniture

05:52.520 --> 05:55.432
and defrosted our dinner
with your sweaty hands for a joke?

05:55.520 --> 05:57.909
Yeah, we did.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.473
If he stays, I'll drive him
to the country and leave him.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.878
<i>He's mine.</i>

06:05.600 --> 06:08.273
I can't believe you talked me into this.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.432
I don't interview well.
The reason I didn't get into Harvard.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.637
The professor asked me what
I hoped to accomplish, my nose bled

06:14.720 --> 06:16.711
and I splattered his shirt with blood.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.189
How many people do you
have to talk to while peeing

06:19.280 --> 06:22.238
before you start believing in yourself?

06:22.320 --> 06:23.958
You're right.

06:24.040 --> 06:28.033
So, why are you interested
in this fellowship?

06:29.400 --> 06:31.868
I have passion
for the work you're doing.

06:31.960 --> 06:36.670
I've heard you're amazing, and I
would be honoured to work with you.

06:39.040 --> 06:42.510
- Have a great day, honey.
- You have even a better one, you.

06:42.600 --> 06:46.832
You do it! Yeah, yeah.
You have even a better one.

06:51.240 --> 06:54.073
Perry, I get the feeling
something is bothering you.

06:54.160 --> 06:57.948
Bob, people have a private life,
and people have a professional life,

06:58.040 --> 07:00.918
and, usually, those two hells
are kept pretty separate.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.833
For instance, I don't know
that much about your home life,

07:03.920 --> 07:06.275
other than that you
treat your wife like a dog,

07:06.360 --> 07:09.670
your dog like a wife and your son
like an androgynous ne'er-do-well

07:09.760 --> 07:12.797
who drains your retirement
to open up a shop in Minneapolis.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.997
Harrison posted
his first profit this quarter.

07:16.080 --> 07:20.198
Aces. And I'm guessing that's
because his significant other...

07:20.280 --> 07:22.589
- Terrence.
...doesn't follow him around

07:22.680 --> 07:26.753
the shop all day, telling him just
exactly what colour is in this season,

07:26.840 --> 07:30.913
or showing all of the other employees
that he is not the boss of his own life.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.594
You see, the woman is everywhere.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.591
There when I work out in the morning,

07:35.680 --> 07:37.750
when I work out in the car
on the way to work,

07:37.840 --> 07:39.637
and when I work out
when I get to work.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.950
I can't seem to get away from her,

07:42.040 --> 07:44.713
and that used to be fine
when she came for five minutes

07:44.800 --> 07:49.920
every month or so to feed on my dignity,
but now, I'd honestly kill myself, Bob,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.673
if I wasn't convinced
Jordan wouldn't already be there

07:52.760 --> 07:56.309
waiting for me in the afterlife.
You see, typical of her,

07:56.400 --> 07:59.392
she went ahead and signed us up
for an eternal tandem bike ride

07:59.480 --> 08:01.391
all along the banks of the River Styx.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.829
I'm so glad you shared.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.639
How would you like
to make this a full-time job?

08:07.720 --> 08:09.676
I'll have to think about it.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.068
How could you not see this coming?

08:18.600 --> 08:22.070
- Hooch just got in the shower.
- Let the games begin.

08:24.880 --> 08:29.556
Who the hell put bouillon cubes
in the showerhead?!

08:29.640 --> 08:31.551
Did you do it? Did you?!

08:31.640 --> 08:35.871
If it happens again,
I will wait in my SUV,

08:35.960 --> 08:41.592
blast me some speed metal,
5.1 surround sound, heavy on the bass,

08:41.679 --> 08:45.912
and someone will be getting mowed down.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.756
Hooch is crazy.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.878
I'm gonna miss this kind of stuff.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.918
Why? We'll be able to pull pranks
on him after you move out.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.470
We won't be staying up planning anything
as genius as the soup shower.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.357
This is the end of an era, Super Choc.

09:03.440 --> 09:07.479
You know how you're prone to sensitive,
girly displays of sentimentality?

09:07.560 --> 09:08.549
Guilty.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.871
If you reel it back a bit, I'll
get somebody to cover for me tonight,

09:11.960 --> 09:15.270
- and I'll help you pack your stuff.
- Can we cut words out of magazines

09:15.360 --> 09:18.397
that represent how we feel
and glue them into a collage?

09:18.480 --> 09:21.278
- Hell, no.
- Can we drink beers and reminisce?

09:21.360 --> 09:23.954
- Hell, yes.
- That's all I wanted to do anyway.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.678
<i>Plus, I already made the collage.</i>

09:25.760 --> 09:26.829
Now listen to me.

09:26.920 --> 09:30.037
Make tonight count cos
you'll never be as cool as you were

09:30.120 --> 09:35.240
when you were rollin' with the big dog
as your roommate, you know?

09:35.320 --> 09:37.675
<i>No, I didn't know.</i>

09:38.320 --> 09:41.312
Maybe Jake shouldn't
have pushed you into that interview.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.278
Maybe I should've covered my mouth
when I sneezed blood.

09:44.360 --> 09:47.193
Come on, Elliot.
He's always telling you what to do.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.918
That's not true.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.715
<i>Hey, it's Jake. Buzz me up.</i>

09:53.520 --> 09:55.590
Oh, my God, you're right.

09:55.680 --> 09:58.592
Don't let him be your puppet master.

09:58.680 --> 10:00.352
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.790
- What's up?
- I have a headache.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.952
- Take some aspirin.
- Don't tell me what to do.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.553
You're not the boss of me.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.755
OK, what just happened?

10:14.640 --> 10:17.438
So, do you think I should take the job?

10:17.520 --> 10:18.748
Perry?

10:18.840 --> 10:20.796
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.838
I was just thinking
about this little boy in here.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.036
He's only eight, and he's terminal.

10:27.640 --> 10:30.552
I hope his parents spent
as much time with him as they could.

10:30.640 --> 10:33.313
You're here one minute,
and then the next, you're...

10:34.120 --> 10:36.714
What... what were you saying?

10:36.800 --> 10:38.518
Nothing.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.197
Stick your hand out.

10:43.280 --> 10:44.315
Good man.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.834
Get yourself some ice cream.
Go on, get out of here.

10:51.200 --> 10:55.591
J.D., I got a mondo 82-inch pizza
with our names on it!

10:55.680 --> 10:58.353
Dude! It's hu...

11:01.720 --> 11:05.269
What the hell? We're supposed to hang,
and all of a sudden you moved out?

11:05.360 --> 11:09.069
<i>It's hard to hide your emotions</i>
<i>in front of people who know you well.</i>

11:10.000 --> 11:11.797
Answer it.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.952
Or don't.

11:15.280 --> 11:16.315
Hello.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.834
<i>Like excitement about a new job...</i>

11:18.920 --> 11:21.673
- I got the fellowship.
- Hey!

11:23.560 --> 11:26.074
<i>... or disappointment</i>
<i>about a lost opportunity.</i>

11:26.160 --> 11:29.869
- I'm sorry, Bob. I can't take the job.
- Maybe next year.

11:37.400 --> 11:41.188
<i>As for me, I just didn't want Turk</i>
<i>to know that he'd hurt my feelings.</i>

11:41.280 --> 11:43.794
I don't know.
I figured it wasn't that big a deal.

11:43.880 --> 11:47.350
Hey, I'm pretty tired from the move,
so I'm probably just gonna crash.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.558
I'm sort of famished.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.638
- Morning.
- Yeah.

12:14.720 --> 12:16.756
<i>Turk didn't even</i>
<i>realize he pissed me off,</i>

12:16.840 --> 12:19.354
<i>so explaining my feelings to him</i>
<i>was the smart move.</i>

12:19.440 --> 12:21.317
<i>I took a slightly different tack.</i>

12:21.400 --> 12:24.756
- That seat's taken, arse-face.
- By who?

12:24.840 --> 12:26.671
Hello, there, Chocolate Bear Two.

12:26.760 --> 12:29.069
Hooch?
J.D., what the hell's going on here?

12:29.160 --> 12:30.434
I replaced your arse.

12:30.520 --> 12:33.353
By the by, Johnny told me
that you were responsible

12:33.440 --> 12:36.034
for my brothy shower the other day.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.838
If it happens again,

12:39.920 --> 12:42.150
I'm gonna take one of your fingers.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.394
That'll be my funny prank.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.632
Hooch is crazy.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.238
Oh, sorry. Old habit.

12:52.320 --> 12:55.153
<i>I wasn't the only unhappy person</i>
<i>in our hospital family.</i>

12:55.240 --> 12:58.516
Sure, Jake, I'll tell you why it
feels like I have a problem with you.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.637
The fact that Elliot jumps so high
whenever you tell her to

13:01.720 --> 13:05.872
may seem harmless, but as a result,
she's been stealing all my sports bras.

13:05.960 --> 13:08.793
Seriously! The only one I have left
is the one I'm wearing,

13:08.880 --> 13:10.996
and it works great. See?

13:11.080 --> 13:13.116
- It works pretty nicely.
- It does, right?

13:13.200 --> 13:16.112
But if I wanna jump up
and down again this week,

13:16.200 --> 13:18.191
I'm stuck until laundry day.

13:18.280 --> 13:20.430
I'm gonna have to guess
what your point is,

13:20.520 --> 13:23.193
but I think it's that I control Elliot,
which I don't.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.714
Here. Watch this.
Elliot, will you shove that guy?

13:31.240 --> 13:34.471
Why do that? I was trying
to prove you don't do everything I say.

13:34.560 --> 13:39.395
Well, clue me in, stud. That was
Creepy Carl. He runs an upskirt website.

13:39.480 --> 13:40.993
I'm on it.

13:51.160 --> 13:54.038
Oh, yeah, Ted. I moved the file cabinet.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.473
I'm gonna miss this office.

13:55.560 --> 14:00.236
Why? It smells like that odd combo
of flop sweat, hopelessness and feet.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.834
Yeah, I know. It's just...

14:02.920 --> 14:08.074
I guess this stupid job
made me feel valid again. You know?

14:08.160 --> 14:11.550
You don't know.
It's OK. See you at home.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.555
- Who's ready for a pie break?
- No.

14:22.640 --> 14:24.710
- Come on. Why not?
- Why don't you ask Todd?

14:24.800 --> 14:27.314
Due to what can only be
described as epic diarrhoea,

14:27.400 --> 14:29.277
he's been on an IV drip for 36 hours.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.828
Make it stop five.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.638
<i>Maybe I was being unfair to Turk.</i>

14:33.720 --> 14:36.598
<i>Maybe it's too much to expect</i>
<i>a friend to sense you're upset</i>

14:36.680 --> 14:37.954
<i>and want to talk about it.</i>

14:38.040 --> 14:40.873
Carla, I can sense you're upset.
Talk to me.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.633
<i>But Turk's a prideful guy,</i>
<i>and it's hard for prideful guys</i>

14:44.720 --> 14:46.472
<i>to admit they've been insensitive.</i>

14:46.560 --> 14:50.394
Listen, Jordan,
I've been incredibly insensitive.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.835
<i>Touché, magic hallway.</i>

14:52.920 --> 14:55.753
<i>I should've had more faith</i>
<i>in my friend to come through.</i>

14:55.840 --> 14:56.829
Turk!

14:56.920 --> 14:59.957
No, it's me, Hooch, Vanilla Bear.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.269
Hooch is crazy.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.435
So, Hooch, this is it.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.272
<i>Then things took a turn.</i>

15:08.360 --> 15:10.237
Wait, where's Rowdy?

15:12.120 --> 15:14.395
"I'm at the hospital"?

15:17.360 --> 15:18.475
There he is!

15:22.520 --> 15:24.158
There he is!

15:25.160 --> 15:27.276
OK, he's going up.
I'll take the stairs.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.272
You don't let anyone out
of that elevator. Be strong, Hooch.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.475
I'll try.

15:33.560 --> 15:36.028
So where's Chocolate Bear Number Two?

15:39.480 --> 15:41.869
Who else thinks
they're faster than me, huh?

15:43.320 --> 15:45.311
Yo, Hooch is seriously crazy.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.758
Carla, Jake makes me happy.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.673
There's a chance he'll be
my second boyfriend not to end up

15:52.760 --> 15:55.274
with my mom or brother.
He doesn't tell me what to do.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.794
Sure, he did tell me
to come up here and talk to you,

15:57.880 --> 16:00.917
but I was gonna cos I wanted to ask
if I should wear heels or flats

16:01.000 --> 16:02.831
when we celebrate my new job tonight.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.150
Instead I'm trying
to figure out your problem.

16:05.240 --> 16:06.798
I thought you were staying, OK?

16:08.040 --> 16:11.191
I've been here for 11 years,
and it's always the same story.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.919
I get really close to someone,
and they move on.

16:15.760 --> 16:20.390
I don't want to be 50 making friends
with the new 25-year-old interns.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.471
They'll make fun of me
when we go dancing.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.676
Not if I go with you.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.352
And then they kiss?

16:33.280 --> 16:34.759
Sorry.

16:37.280 --> 16:40.078
Look at him. What an angel.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.593
Down, he's waking up.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.548
Hey, Jordan...

16:46.640 --> 16:49.279
Lookit, I tried to guilt you
into not taking that job.

16:49.360 --> 16:50.395
Really?

16:51.240 --> 16:54.471
Look, I don't want to be one
of those moms that never sees her kids,

16:54.560 --> 16:57.199
but I don't want to be one of those moms
that stays at home

16:57.280 --> 17:00.955
but resents her kids cos she wishes she
was working so she could go to an office

17:01.040 --> 17:03.076
and feel bad
about not being with her kids.

17:03.160 --> 17:06.071
I was just worried
that you would think I was a bad mom.

17:06.160 --> 17:10.756
Sweetie, you are an evil, soulless,
chemically-enhanced battle-ax

17:10.839 --> 17:14.037
that I truly doubt
is 100 percent human, but...

17:14.119 --> 17:16.680
...you are an amazing mom.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.760
Say you're sorry,
give me a hug and this'll be over.

17:23.839 --> 17:25.671
Why do I have to say I'm sorry?

17:25.760 --> 17:27.352
I don't mean to sound girly,

17:27.440 --> 17:30.477
but for the last 12 years,
you've practically been like my wife.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.073
How is that girly?

17:32.160 --> 17:36.153
Look, before, when you said I'd never be
as cool as when I was living with you,

17:36.240 --> 17:38.800
you know there's some truth to that.

17:38.880 --> 17:42.509
I'm sorta like odd and geeky and...

17:42.600 --> 17:45.512
...you've always sort of validated me.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.636
J.D., you're just moving out.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.836
Well, say things will be the same.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.519
That's Carla. I gotta go.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.636
Things are gonna be different.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.553
But different doesn't always mean bad.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.631
Just means different.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.550
- OK.
- All right.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.759
No better pick-me-up
than a nice slice of Mom's pie.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.751
Why are you so obsessed with this?

18:12.840 --> 18:16.799
I don't know. I think it's cos this
time, I wasn't trying to mess with you.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.871
Really?

18:21.080 --> 18:22.308
Really.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.350
Who would do this to themselves?

18:32.440 --> 18:33.634
Totally worth it.

18:33.720 --> 18:36.075
<i>As every piece of food</i>
<i>I'd put into my body</i>

18:36.160 --> 18:38.310
<i>was rushing out of me,</i>
<i>it got me thinking.</i>

18:38.400 --> 18:42.632
<i>The way some things never change</i>
<i>shines a light on the things that do.</i>

18:42.960 --> 18:46.077
<i>Like when a new person comes</i>
<i>into the hospital to stay...</i>

18:46.960 --> 18:49.076
My office keys, Ted.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.315
Can't believe I'm actually doing this.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.834
You'll meet me out later, right?

18:56.800 --> 18:59.439
<i>... or an old friend leaves for good.</i>

19:06.480 --> 19:09.916
<i>Sometimes the biggest changes</i>
<i>are a result of an impulsive decision.</i>

19:10.000 --> 19:11.558
I think we should have a baby.

19:12.440 --> 19:13.475
What?

19:13.560 --> 19:15.278
I know you're feeling abandoned,

19:15.360 --> 19:17.920
but we just went
through a really rough spot,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.275
and I'm not the type to make decisions

19:20.360 --> 19:23.989
without thinking about it
for at least, like, a few months.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.631
Let's make a baby.

19:38.240 --> 19:42.711
<i>And so here I am, a guy in an</i>
<i>empty apartment with a dead dog.</i>

19:42.800 --> 19:46.429
<i>Oh, and that's not a tear on my cheek.</i>
<i>That's just from the leak in my ceiling.</i>

19:46.520 --> 19:49.671
<i>And, yes, change is scary,</i>
<i>but it's also inevitable.</i>

19:49.760 --> 19:51.557
<i>It's up to you to make the best of it.</i>

19:51.640 --> 19:55.076
<i>I mean, it's not like opportunity's</i>
<i>just gonna fall into your lap.</i>

19:57.760 --> 19:58.749
<i>Then again...</i>

19:58.840 --> 20:00.831
Howdy, neighbour, I'm Jonathan.

20:00.920 --> 20:02.592
Hi.

20:04.320 --> 20:06.117
You eyeballin' my woman?

20:06.200 --> 20:08.634
<i>I hate change.</i>
