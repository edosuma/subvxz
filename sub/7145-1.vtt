1:39:11.758 --> 1:39:13.817
Heard you had a wild place here,
and, uh, well, sir,

1:39:13.893 --> 1:39:15.485
I was thinking
you might be interested

1:39:15.561 --> 1:39:17.859
in a little, uh,
business proposition.

1:39:17.931 --> 1:39:19.455
You ready?

1:39:19.532 --> 1:39:20.965
Theme park.

1:39:21.034 --> 1:39:22.126
Think about it.

Families on safari,

1:39:23.503 --> 1:39:25.300
crazy critters
running all over the place.

[Growling, hissing]

1:39:27.407 --> 1:39:29.466
Hey, there, fella.

1:39:29.542 --> 1:39:31.510
Uhh!

1:39:31.577 --> 1:39:32.942
Whoa!

1:39:33.012 --> 1:39:34.274
[Rumbling]

1:39:34.347 --> 1:39:36.076
You can see it already,
can't you?

1:39:36.149 --> 1:39:37.707
Huh?

1:39:37.784 --> 1:39:39.115
We'd be great together.

1:39:39.185 --> 1:39:41.050
What do you say?
[Clicks tongue]

1:39:44.390 --> 1:39:46.483
