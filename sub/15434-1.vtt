Subtitled by J&J Subtitles, jeralvsut@hotmail.com

00:06.439 --> 00:08.465
I'm not the person you think I am.

00:08.515 --> 00:10.590
That's what you people can't seem to understand.

00:10.640 --> 00:11.993
I am not a bitch!

00:12.622 --> 00:15.000
I am not aggressively plotting to make our mother feel bad.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.170
Then why are you staying in a hotel?

00:17.300 --> 00:19.697
Because, Sarah, the show is putting me up and it's going to be,

00:19.747 --> 00:21.147
like, a gorgeous room.

00:21.197 --> 00:23.483
Then, call Mom and tell her.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.304
No, Sarah, you call Mom and tell her that.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.973
I talk to Mom every day. You guys have hardly spoken in two years.

00:29.023 --> 00:30.133
...peanut butter....

00:30.183 --> 00:30.754
Stop it, Cooper.

00:31.137 --> 00:33.756
Joe, could you take care of Cooper, just for a second?

00:33.806 --> 00:34.807
Yeah, sure.

00:35.508 --> 00:36.651
How's Joe, by the way?

00:36.701 --> 00:37.636
Are things any better?

00:38.774 --> 00:40.094
We decided to do that thing

00:40.144 --> 00:41.308
I was telling you about...

00:41.476 --> 00:42.801
Oh, counselling?

00:42.900 --> 00:45.197
Yeah. Kitty, just call her.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.356
Sarah, she knows I'm coming and she could've called me,

00:47.406 --> 00:48.696
and you know what? I don't have time for this.

00:48.796 --> 00:50.450
Jonathan's going to be here any second,

00:50.500 --> 00:52.559
and I haven't even started my cornish hens.

00:52.609 --> 00:54.456
You're cooking cornish hens?

00:54.556 --> 00:56.439
Yeah. Why?

01:02.046 --> 01:03.300
What am I gonna do, Kevin? Help me.

01:03.300 --> 01:07.511
OK, is there any chance you may have garlic, pasta, frozen peas and chicken broth?

01:07.946 --> 01:12.671
No peas, but you know what, I do have a little sage left over from the dead chickens.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.800
Ok, good, then you can have a delicious meal ready in ten minutes ...

01:15.800 --> 01:19.600
and that was too gay a sentence, even for me!

01:19.600 --> 01:21.900
Now, about our dear mother..

01:21.900 --> 01:23.200
I'm not calling her.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.599
Remember, Kevin, it's my birthday. She has to be nice.

01:28.300 --> 01:29.000
Hi, Mister.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.088
Oh, you're at the kitchen crisis phase.

01:31.138 --> 01:32.348
Oh, is it that obvious?

01:32.398 --> 01:33.718
That, and the billowing smoke.

01:35.100 --> 01:37.269
Woah, kids! I'm still on the phone here.

01:38.700 --> 01:39.879
Sorry, it's Kevin.

01:41.300 --> 01:44.424
Look, go have your lurid, hot sex date with your gorgeous boyfriend

01:44.474 --> 01:45.214
and I'll take care of Mom.

01:45.264 --> 01:46.765
Don't take care of Mom.

01:46.950 --> 01:49.281
All I'm saying is, do you want me to call her and make a case?

01:49.331 --> 01:53.187
A case for what? I have a right of safe return, Kevin, to L.A.

01:53.237 --> 01:54.700
It's guaranteed in the Constitution.

01:54.700 --> 01:56.200
If you really wanna do me a favor,

01:56.200 --> 01:58.111
tell the rest of the family not to call me

01:58.114 --> 02:02.000
so I can have my lurid hot sex date with my

02:02.000 --> 02:04.574
gorgeous boyfriend.

02:04.900 --> 02:05.606
Is that what this is?

02:06.050 --> 02:06.744
Yeah.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.824
Good, cause I just saw dinner.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.374
No, don't. Don't stop.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.005
I wasn't going to.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.359
God! God! I'm gonna kill them!

02:26.100 --> 02:27.851
- Which one?
- All of them.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.885
- Kitty, you want me to pick you up from the airport tomorrow?
- Tommy

02:36.400 --> 02:38.356
C-can you hold on a sec?

02:38.800 --> 02:39.766
God!

02:43.100 --> 02:44.208
Hello, Justin.

02:44.500 --> 02:46.740
Look, I'll pick you up. Don't listen to Tommy.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.236
Where are you?

02:48.700 --> 02:50.200
I'm at Zuma. I'm with Tommy right now.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.615
He's being a total ass-hat.

02:51.900 --> 02:54.000
You know what? You guys are both being total ass-hats.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.100
Didn't Kevin tell you not to call?

02:56.100 --> 02:57.200
Tommy, thank you for the offer.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.100
Justin, I will see you at the airport.

02:59.100 --> 02:59.913
Good-bye!

03:01.300 --> 03:04.263
I'm sorry. It's my family.

03:07.700 --> 03:10.271
I'm sorry, it hasn't been a very romantic farewell.

03:10.321 --> 03:12.465
It's only a farewell for a few days...

03:13.100 --> 03:14.333
unless you get that TV job.

03:15.500 --> 03:16.335
I love you.

03:16.950 --> 03:17.786
I love you, too.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.211
Kitty! Kitty!

03:38.000 --> 03:40.403
Oh my God! Oh My God, you're actually here!

03:40.800 --> 03:42.807
I know, it's a miracle. I can hardly believe it myself.

03:42.900 --> 03:45.700
Well, you are unreliable and you are very skinny,

03:45.700 --> 03:47.976
Justin! Really! What is that?

03:48.400 --> 03:49.433
All right, so, you didn't bring Jonathan?

03:49.483 --> 03:52.500
No, no, I didn't want Dad to challenge him to a

03:52.500 --> 03:54.616
boxing match or a horse race or something.

03:54.666 --> 03:55.774
God, I'd love to see that.

03:56.100 --> 03:58.300
All right, let's get some food before I bring you to the folks,

03:58.300 --> 04:00.535
that way you can feed me and interrogate me at the same time. All right?

04:01.000 --> 04:04.530
So, you're really going to be saying pompously relevant stuff on TV?

04:04.900 --> 04:07.888
Well, they need someone young-ish from the right.

04:08.300 --> 04:10.428
So, has Mom said anything at all?

04:10.800 --> 04:14.108
Ah, no, aside from calling you the "Young Margaret Thatcher" last night.

04:14.158 --> 04:15.812
Well, better her than Ava Braun.

04:15.900 --> 04:18.552
I'll have my flak jacket for when you two get into it.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.088
So, what do you want? You want, like, a burger or something?

04:21.100 --> 04:23.600
Yes, ah, quickly, but I'm under strict instructions

04:23.600 --> 04:25.892
not to, ah, well, not to get high.

04:25.900 --> 04:27.544
Oh, yeah, how's that going?

04:28.000 --> 04:28.590
We'll see.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.600
And, then, ah, I gotta take you to the hotel,

04:31.600 --> 04:36.079
and then, is there any way you can get from the hotel to the house on your own? Because...

04:36.300 --> 04:39.034
Because what? You have to pick up a girl?

04:41.300 --> 04:42.391
Yes. Guilty.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.141
Are you still going to that Vet's Group?

04:44.500 --> 04:47.705
Yeah, you know, I go sometimes. There's this one, ah, just for guys who were in Afghanistan,

04:47.755 --> 04:49.022
like me, so, it's...

04:50.250 --> 04:50.963
Yeah. Does it help?

04:51.200 --> 04:55.000
Yeah, you know, half the time it's good to know other guys are going through things that I'm going through, and

04:55.000 --> 04:56.472
the other half of the time, it's just lame.

04:58.400 --> 04:59.100
Who's the girl?

04:59.100 --> 05:01.303
Her name is Fawn and she's unbelievably hot!

05:01.400 --> 05:03.628
Ah, you just don't want to be there when I see Mom.

05:03.630 --> 05:04.578
That, too.

05:24.300 --> 05:25.595
Hey, Daddy.

05:25.900 --> 05:26.837
Hello, Princess.

05:28.800 --> 05:29.792
Ah, look at you.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.531
You look almost all-grown up.

05:35.581 --> 05:37.986
I know it. Damn it.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.961
How's Mom? Is she here?

05:40.200 --> 05:41.593
Um, someplace..

05:41.643 --> 05:46.347
Yes, yes. Of course I'm here, Kitty.

05:46.700 --> 05:47.466
Hi, Mom.

05:49.200 --> 05:53.024
Ah, you look wonderful! Just wonderful.

05:53.100 --> 05:53.950
Thanks.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.886
You could use a little sun, maybe some raisins or something.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.517
How's the hotel?

06:01.000 --> 06:01.680
Fine.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.626
Good. Good.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.221
Raisins?

06:07.900 --> 06:09.411
Well...

06:10.500 --> 06:12.606
Yes, I saw that show you're meeting on.

06:12.656 --> 06:16.100
You hate it, right? More yelling about politics?

06:16.150 --> 06:17.157
Who says they gotta yell?

06:18.400 --> 06:19.762
Well, it's complicated, Dad.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.585
I don't think I'm TV-ready.

06:21.635 --> 06:22.950
Ah, don't be so sure.

06:23.800 --> 06:28.546
Bet on yourself, Honey. Never forget: "Bet on yourself."

06:29.700 --> 06:32.441
Oh, God, look at you all! Kitty's getting you drunk already!

06:32.491 --> 06:35.474
No, no, no, no, they're getting me drunk already!

06:35.500 --> 06:39.696
Hey, hey, hey! No more manhandling! Somebody's gonna get hurt!

06:39.900 --> 06:41.872
Oh, Mister Uncle Saul.生

06:41.922 --> 06:42.946
Don't you Mister Uncle Saul me.

06:42.996 --> 06:46.144
I heard you on the radio. You are wrong about immigration.

06:46.194 --> 06:47.183
Oh, God

06:47.183 --> 06:50.063
help us, no...please! The Lefties are starting.

06:50.113 --> 06:54.598
Come here! So gorgeous! I love you!

06:54.900 --> 06:57.292
ommy, I'm going to steal away with you wife!

06:57.700 --> 06:59.000
How's work?

06:59.000 --> 07:02.008
Well, I was with six year-olds all day, teaching ...

07:02.058 --> 07:03.350
- Margaritas. 
- Margaritas.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.542
Mom, Kitty, Tommy, everyone! This is Fawn!

07:05.592 --> 07:08.645
Fawn, this is Mom, Kitty and Tommy.

07:08.695 --> 07:12.724
Mom, Fawn is the girl in the commercial I showed you, the one where she's on the beach in the sand, making love,

07:12.774 --> 07:14.800
and if you use their perfume, you get rich!

07:14.800 --> 07:16.671
Well, guess what, Mama, you also get Fawn!

07:16.800 --> 07:17.454
Justin

07:18.600 --> 07:19.700
Swimming, folks! I mean, I'm not going

07:19.700 --> 07:21.400
to do her on the island in the guacamole,

07:21.500 --> 07:22.615
or am I?

07:22.715 --> 07:25.773
I'm your lawyer, not your nurse...

07:27.650 --> 07:28.711
Wayne, I'll call you back.

07:28.800 --> 07:29.660
Kevin, this is Fawn

07:29.710 --> 07:30.456
Fawn, this is Kevin

07:30.506 --> 07:31.922
If you ever get arrested again, Sweetie,

07:31.972 --> 07:32.938
Kevin's your guy.

07:33.250 --> 07:33.994
Come on, let's go swimming.

07:35.100 --> 07:38.644
They dropped the charges.

07:40.300 --> 07:43.349
Great! Arrested again?

07:43.600 --> 07:44.458
Who's he dating now?

07:44.508 --> 07:46.014
Squeaky Fromm?

07:46.064 --> 07:49.386
- Hello, Mistress of the Airwaves!
- Hi.

07:49.424 --> 07:50.677
Did he get a job yet?

07:51.200 --> 07:52.613
Just lay off of him tonight, OK?

07:53.100 --> 07:55.405
Mom, you realize he's loaded, right?

08:09.600 --> 08:10.545
Hey, Kev.

08:11.500 --> 08:12.367
Hey, Dad.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.874
We need to talk about work, get you back on track

08:16.800 --> 08:18.480
Come to my office tomorrow, noon.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.589
And get some coffee before you embarass yourself.

08:29.700 --> 08:33.299
Thank you. Who is that?

08:35.700 --> 08:36.745
She's with Justin.

08:37.226 --> 08:38.054
Nice rack.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.703
OK, so what's the deal?

08:40.100 --> 08:42.452
What's up with this, ah...counselling?

08:42.600 --> 08:48.426
Ah, how to put it? Two little kids, we have Gabe three nights a week,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.460
too much management, so little touching.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.802
So little touching.

08:55.900 --> 08:58.844
You know I hear that even if you're not in the mood,

08:59.200 --> 09:01.603
if you start and just let it happen, that

09:02.225 --> 09:03.875
something'll kick in...

09:04.139 --> 09:06.563
- Yeah?
- Yeah, that's what you're supposed to do, anyway.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.137
Yeah, maybe.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.400
You know, I thought when I quit my old job that I would gain

09:11.400 --> 09:13.946
in time what I lost in salary,

09:14.112 --> 09:15.350
but being a working Mom is like

09:15.400 --> 09:17.639
being a currency that never has enough value

09:18.100 --> 09:19.820
Oh my God, I'm gonna steal that line!

09:20.400 --> 09:23.000
Plus, it's not easy, you know, having these two parents

09:23.000 --> 09:25.593
who have this absurd iconic romance.

09:25.643 --> 09:28.282
I know. They're so Ron and Nancy.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.299
Who made you this way?

09:33.950 --> 09:35.327
You OK, Mom? You need help?

09:36.531 --> 09:38.737
You know, why don't you ever bring anyone home?

09:39.200 --> 09:40.400
I told you, we're not ashamed of...

09:40.400 --> 09:42.889
Mom! Mom! We've had this conversation, OK?

09:42.900 --> 09:45.300
There's no issue, I work a lot. It's hard to meet guys.

09:45.300 --> 09:46.000
But, it's not something --

09:46.000 --> 09:48.900
Don't start with me because you won't fight with Kitty!

09:48.900 --> 09:53.750
If you two just got it out, what?... OK!

09:56.525 --> 09:57.936
- Hey. 
- Hey.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.266
Oh.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.715
Oh, that's right! Oh!

10:06.300 --> 10:08.442
Now, stop avoiding each other and talk.

10:10.900 --> 10:11.523
OK.

10:14.045 --> 10:17.226
So...Isn't this nice? Here we are all.

10:17.700 --> 10:18.726
It's been so long.

10:18.776 --> 10:20.900
Oh! I should've put these napkins out!

10:20.900 --> 10:21.469
Nora!

10:21.800 --> 10:22.657
Mom, you know...

10:27.700 --> 10:30.984
Hello? Hold on a second.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.792
We probably have a lot to say each other, right?

10:37.800 --> 10:41.423
You know what, Kitty, we really don't. Really, we don't.

10:43.150 --> 10:45.428
You don't want to talk? Really?

10:48.200 --> 10:49.963
What kind of a relationship is that?

10:50.063 --> 10:52.546
It's the only kind of a relationship we can have right now.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.800
Kitty, your father is watching us

10:56.800 --> 10:59.073
and it is so important to him ...

11:00.700 --> 11:03.363
Could we hug or something?

11:09.200 --> 11:10.183
Thank you.

11:27.300 --> 11:28.977
What the hell you doing calling my home?

11:29.400 --> 11:30.288
You out of your mind?

11:33.037 --> 11:35.390

11:37.700 --> 11:39.061
Tommy, you wanna do something?

11:39.111 --> 11:41.391
I am, I'm having a beer, now come over here and join me.

11:41.491 --> 11:43.886
Boy, it's such a relief when they're finally asleep!

11:43.936 --> 11:46.061
- The kids?
- No, the folks.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.218
You know, they actually seem really great!

11:48.500 --> 11:51.823
Hey, does anybody wanna go out? There's this great bar in Chinatown

11:51.900 --> 11:52.604
we could tear up!

11:53.100 --> 11:54.666
Do they allow people with jobs to go there?

11:54.900 --> 11:58.411
Or is it just for unemployed hipsters who know every episode of Scooby?

11:58.511 --> 12:01.500
No, it's also a kind of a favorite of Gen-Y veterans from foreign wars.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.350
Ah, you?

12:08.400 --> 12:09.728
Ah, no. I'm on New York time.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.060
All right, ciao, everyone.

12:13.650 --> 12:14.241
I love you.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.415
Bye. Thanks!

12:15.776 --> 12:16.458
Bye.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.847
You guys are all really nice!

12:23.700 --> 12:25.141
Obviously, I'm worried.

12:26.900 --> 12:28.600
You know, I keep telling you guys,

12:28.600 --> 12:31.100
he's OK. He's just finding himself.

12:31.100 --> 12:31.867
Yeah, I think so, too.

12:32.800 --> 12:35.000
You all do the Walker Watch on him.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.600
Anybody'd get spooked by that!

12:36.600 --> 12:38.635
God, he's right. That's why I don't live here.

12:38.685 --> 12:41.741
If you lived here, you'd have more control over what's said about you.

12:41.791 --> 12:43.933
What, do you think I care? What do you say about me?

12:44.432 --> 12:45.724
You're fat.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.471
So, you and mother, not a disaster, right?

12:49.600 --> 12:52.247
Oh, maybe she's planning on a sneak attack for later.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.327
I'm surprised you didn't bring your muscle.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.186
What's up with Jonathan, hmm? Anything you wanna tell us?

12:58.200 --> 13:01.185
Ah, no. Sarah, what did you tell them?

13:01.200 --> 13:01.984
Nothing.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.525
No, no, no, nothing.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.067
No, we, we like him.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.961
Oh. But?

13:10.900 --> 13:12.400
But, it's you with him

13:12.400 --> 13:13.600
I'm not over the moon about.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.780
You seem slightly...

13:15.400 --> 13:16.523
I don't know, smaller

13:16.573 --> 13:19.823
to accomodate what you see as his very large presence.

13:19.873 --> 13:21.946
He's a little self-involved, that's all.

13:21.996 --> 13:23.713
Oh, that is so not true.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.300
Oh, when we had dinner in New York last year,

13:25.300 --> 13:27.432
he chose the restaurant, the wine, everything.

13:27.450 --> 13:28.407
I was, like, "Where's Kitty?"

13:28.600 --> 13:30.474
Oh, God. That is absolutely not true.

13:30.524 --> 13:33.600
Hey, maybe it's just part of the whole conservative, anti-feminist thing, right?

13:34.072 --> 13:36.559
To put yourself in some sort of second place?

13:36.600 --> 13:39.500
You know what, Kevin? You're gonna have to get over thinking that my politics

13:39.500 --> 13:41.600
are just poses geared to annoy you.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.123
- About Jonathan, it's not really our place...
- No. No. No.

13:44.173 --> 13:45.102
- if Kitty's happy
- Hey, Hey. No, look,

13:45.152 --> 13:47.550
Not at all. I--I can't keep a guy,

13:47.600 --> 13:48.900
Joe and Sarah are in counseling,

13:48.900 --> 13:49.771
the whole family's...

13:49.821 --> 13:51.342
- What?
- What?

13:51.700 --> 13:55.347
Oh, that's great. That's great. I told one person. Kitty!

13:55.397 --> 13:57.000
You know what, forget about Jonathan, and the fact that you think I'm

13:57.000 --> 13:59.400
some horrifying little zombie with him,

13:59.400 --> 14:02.009
I'm sick of the cracks about my political beliefs.

14:02.800 --> 14:03.583
I am conservative.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.845
Tough on crime, big on defense, America First,

14:06.895 --> 14:08.600
old-fashioned, and in your face!

14:08.650 --> 14:09.582
I'm with you there, Kit.

14:10.149 --> 14:11.813
And if you think this is funny, great!

14:12.494 --> 14:14.183
I'm glad to be of comic service, but

14:14.233 --> 14:15.900
you just keep on laughing and watch

14:15.900 --> 14:18.558
the rest of the country pass you by.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.034
You set her off, Kevin!

14:27.700 --> 14:29.439
Yeah, you set me off, Kevin!

14:51.400 --> 14:53.908
Hey, I'm sorry about the counselling thing.

14:53.958 --> 14:55.850
I really only told Kitty.

14:56.304 --> 15:00.906
Forget it. I am immune to your family by now.

15:25.492 --> 15:26.278
Good-night, Babe.

15:28.000 --> 15:28.893
Good-night.

15:50.700 --> 15:51.596
Mr. Walker.

15:52.050 --> 15:53.198
Well, I kinda like this one.

15:53.950 --> 15:54.939
Not sure about the apple, though.

15:54.989 --> 15:55.758
It's a peach.

15:58.637 --> 15:59.292
Hey, guys.

15:59.342 --> 16:01.167
The new labels.

16:01.217 --> 16:02.650
I wish I had more for you, but

16:02.700 --> 16:04.977
I can't seem to get my designers paid.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.900
Your Uncle Saul's in charge of accounting. You'll

16:07.900 --> 16:09.021
have to deal with him, OK?

16:09.071 --> 16:10.167
I'll go hound him again.

16:10.217 --> 16:12.002
Tommy, how are things up in Ojai?

16:12.052 --> 16:13.300
Overtime glitch.

16:13.300 --> 16:14.645
It's all fine, I took care of it.

16:16.450 --> 16:16.999
Good.

16:31.100 --> 16:32.033
Jonathan!

16:33.059 --> 16:33.909
What are you do--? What? What?

16:33.959 --> 16:36.519
Oh my God! That suit!

16:37.072 --> 16:40.019
You look like a penguin in the Sahara! What are you doing here?

16:41.052 --> 16:42.258
A little birthday present.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.712
I figured you need a little vacation time.

16:44.812 --> 16:47.135
After all this, I booked us a suite on Lanai.

16:47.744 --> 16:51.042
What? I have to--I have to get back and do the radio show.

16:51.092 --> 16:52.227
Well, you got a lot of time off, Dear.

16:52.900 --> 16:54.156
Oh, OK, wow.

16:55.700 --> 16:59.100
I guess it's just that I'm focused on this interview tomorrow, so...

16:59.100 --> 17:01.321
We don't have to go if you don't want. We'll just go back to New York.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.613
No, no, it's great!

17:04.000 --> 17:05.849
I got us a suite and I'll have somebody move your bags.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.559
Oh, OK.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.877
Red flags go up. I get a call.

17:10.928 --> 17:15.001
17 workers at your ranch complaining about delays in overtime payments and

17:15.050 --> 17:17.107
red flags go up! What else can I say?

17:17.156 --> 17:18.900
Look, they were paid, you were called off.

17:18.900 --> 17:21.396
You have no reason to be here other than showboating!

17:21.446 --> 17:23.510
You know what? I resent that. This is the third time.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.670
Woah! Woah! This has happened before?

17:25.700 --> 17:27.229
It was a mistake, Sarah, that's all.

17:27.279 --> 17:28.407
Bookkeeping, OK?

17:28.947 --> 17:30.278
We're trying to modernize.

17:33.952 --> 17:34.618
OK.

17:35.671 --> 17:39.103
In the future, if you have a problem, please call me. Anytime.

17:40.820 --> 17:41.419
Thank you.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.296
Don't look at me.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.214
Three times, Saul! What's going on?

17:50.500 --> 17:52.900
Sarah, darling, I'm trying to streamline our billing.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.000
My books are on one system,

17:55.050 --> 17:56.028
the bank's are on another.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.236
It's fine. It's gonna be fine.

18:14.700 --> 18:16.562
Oh, crap!

18:34.550 --> 18:35.937
This is not deliberate, Holly.

18:35.987 --> 18:39.878
Oh, please, William. This...

18:39.900 --> 18:44.719
You are handling me as if I am a problem.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.300
That's exactly how you are behaving.

18:46.300 --> 18:47.900
I have been calling here all week and you

18:47.900 --> 18:49.042
won't talk to me,

18:49.200 --> 18:52.032
- I have expenses, I have bills to pay, I...
- Holly

18:52.082 --> 18:52.919
I can't...

18:53.200 --> 18:55.647
Holly, I'm having cash problems. I --

18:58.427 --> 19:01.260
It's my son. Can we talk about this later?

19:18.250 --> 19:19.085
You're late.

19:20.931 --> 19:21.850
Ah, is everything all right?

19:22.050 --> 19:23.331
There's a job, at a restaurant.

19:23.850 --> 19:24.632
I made a call.

19:24.682 --> 19:27.137
The boys at Rousseau's are expecting you tomorrow.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.380
Sorry to call you back here,

19:29.430 --> 19:31.000
but you developed the line, so ...

19:31.000 --> 19:32.300
For grown-ups. This makes it look like

19:32.300 --> 19:33.400
kiddie-crack.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.992
Family branding, it's called.

19:35.042 --> 19:37.619
Have they seen the stats on childhood obesity?

19:37.669 --> 19:39.944
We're gonna get killed for pushing liquid candy.

19:39.994 --> 19:41.712
Caffeinated liquid candy and

19:41.762 --> 19:43.500
it's not "us" anymore because you

19:43.500 --> 19:45.667
abaondoned me, remember? You quit.

19:45.717 --> 19:47.358
Apparently, just in time.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.576
I'll get them to take another pass at it.

19:53.900 --> 19:55.554
I just wanted to make sure I wasn't crazy.

19:58.100 --> 19:59.237
You know you're not.

20:00.200 --> 20:05.248
So, ah, is it better with your job with your father?

20:06.550 --> 20:08.408
Are you spending more time at home?

20:09.400 --> 20:10.218
Almost.

20:10.900 --> 20:11.706
Ah, sometimes.

20:13.700 --> 20:14.565
And Joe?

20:14.665 --> 20:15.620
Things better?

20:17.600 --> 20:20.723
Yeah. Yeah, things are good.

20:24.900 --> 20:26.349
You know, I should probably get going

20:26.700 --> 20:30.300
You know, it's not a betrayal to talk about it.

20:30.500 --> 20:31.354
I'm your friend.

20:31.750 --> 20:33.178
Yeah, so we keep saying.

20:38.300 --> 20:39.153
It's good to see you.

20:39.203 --> 20:42.496
It's just... You didn't leave because of us,

20:42.546 --> 20:44.733
because of something that might've happened?

20:46.138 --> 20:50.858
I would...I would hate to think that.

20:50.908 --> 20:53.130
No. Not at all.

20:54.600 --> 20:57.750
And we have lives, families.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.299
We knew where the line was.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.779
Right. That's right.

21:48.100 --> 21:50.600
The blue chair is here, the moderator white chair is here,

21:50.600 --> 21:51.957
and then this is you.

21:53.800 --> 21:57.502
Oh, and we have an amazing print campaign to announce your arrival!

21:57.600 --> 22:00.226
Oh! No! Oh, God!

22:00.300 --> 22:03.320
What? "Oh no?" The poster's my closer.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.724
You know, it's just that I've seen the show and,

22:07.100 --> 22:09.900
for me, politics is not about show business.

22:09.900 --> 22:13.619
It's... well, I'm very passionate about my views.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.152
What makes you think we don't want that?

22:18.300 --> 22:22.069
Well, the fact is is that radio, it works for me.

22:22.100 --> 22:24.921
I get to mouth off and then I go to the movies, and I'm not out there...

22:24.950 --> 22:27.086
Yeah, in other words, you can hide in satellite radio.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.788
Peek out just enough to not make a difference.

22:30.400 --> 22:34.657
I mean, seriously, if we're talking about passion, we give you a national profile

22:34.700 --> 22:38.516
that absolutely comes with risk and an uncomfortable level of exposure for someone like you, but ...

22:39.100 --> 22:41.716
I guess the question is is how much do you believe in what you're saying?

22:43.600 --> 22:44.908
And how much do you want people to hear you?

22:47.700 --> 22:48.513
Oh, sorry.

22:48.563 --> 22:51.623
Oh, no, no, no, no. Hold up. I want you to meet Kitty Walker.

22:52.700 --> 22:53.891
Kitty, Warren Salter.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.199
Warren's our blue chair guy.

22:55.249 --> 22:55.944
Nice to meet you.

22:56.000 --> 22:56.837
Hi, nice to meet you.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.213
- Red hot? Wow! So, I get blue --
- Oh

23:02.263 --> 23:03.853
don't even go there.

23:04.994 --> 23:05.887
I've heard your work.

23:06.869 --> 23:07.848
Hmm. I've seen yours.

23:08.100 --> 23:10.332
So you know? I can be very mean.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.763
Hmm. I can do mean.

23:14.500 --> 23:15.346
Could be fun.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.100
Wow! See how great you two are together already?

23:19.100 --> 23:20.448
C'mon, it's insane!

23:21.700 --> 23:22.400
Pleasure to meet you.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.361
Nice to meet you.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.332
What are you doing in Saul's office?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.293
He'll go bananas, like a fierce little old--

24:21.300 --> 24:22.014
Come here.

24:22.400 --> 24:22.906
What?

24:23.600 --> 24:26.386
It's just that there are all these accounts, stuff I've never seen before.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.198
- And they're locked!
- Locked?

24:29.248 --> 24:32.977
Yeah. It's not cool, Tom. This is a family business.

24:33.027 --> 24:34.433
There shouldn't be any secrets here.

24:34.800 --> 24:35.599
What is all this?

24:36.400 --> 24:39.155
These accounts. Why are they locked?

24:43.600 --> 24:44.663
What are you doing?

24:45.500 --> 24:49.800
Sarah, I move money around, that's what I do.

24:49.800 --> 24:51.365
Nobody's ever had a question.

24:51.700 --> 24:54.294
OK, but I do. So...

24:54.344 --> 24:55.900
why don't you open them up and you can

24:55.900 --> 24:56.644
walk us through it.

24:56.694 --> 24:57.362
RIght now?

24:57.500 --> 24:58.337
Yeah.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.684
No, that's impossible.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.200
And I have to tell you, I don't like what's going on here.

25:06.200 --> 25:09.575
The two of you barging in here with this agenda.

25:10.400 --> 25:13.905
You have obviously violated my trust, not to mention my office!

25:13.955 --> 25:14.700
No, no, no. no.

25:14.700 --> 25:16.200
Why not just include us, please?

25:16.200 --> 25:19.300
Because, Thomas, I have a meeting with all of our Napa Valley suppliers, and

25:19.300 --> 25:23.900
frankly...I think that's a lot more interesting and a lot more important than

25:23.900 --> 25:26.044
doing this tap dance with you kids.

25:27.163 --> 25:30.126
Saul, this company has a serious cash-flow problem!

25:30.800 --> 25:32.257
And we need to know why.

25:35.300 --> 25:37.200
And let me be very clear about this --

25:37.200 --> 25:41.500
I won't be scolded and I won't be handled or spoken to like I'm a child.

25:41.500 --> 25:45.000
So, the next time that you have an impulse to talk to me like that, please --

25:45.000 --> 25:47.521
Take a beat and reconsider.

25:47.900 --> 25:48.646
OK?

26:04.200 --> 26:05.763
- Boo!
- Hey, Kit.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.946
I ordered you a martini.

26:11.800 --> 26:12.786
You look happy.

26:12.836 --> 26:14.409
I guess I do.

26:15.100 --> 26:16.522
I don't know, I don't know, I just...

26:17.300 --> 26:19.145
well, I didn't expect them to be smart.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.876
Wow! So, you're actually considering this?!

26:22.000 --> 26:23.800
I know it's crazy to even think about it,

26:23.800 --> 26:25.793
but it's like millions of people watching.

26:26.400 --> 26:27.247
Ah, I see.

26:27.700 --> 26:28.548
What do you see?

26:28.600 --> 26:30.201
I haven't even said anything yet.

26:31.250 --> 26:34.678
But, there's no reason, hypothetically, why you couldn't relocate to L.A.

26:34.700 --> 26:36.473
if the show was a success, right?

26:37.000 --> 26:38.100
I mean, not that it would be, because

26:38.100 --> 26:40.500
politics, it's just --

26:40.500 --> 26:44.172
Well, at the end of the day, there's just nothing you can do to make it sexy, because it's--

26:57.150 --> 26:58.247
Jonathan!

26:59.900 --> 27:00.797
Of course they're gonna want you.

27:01.709 --> 27:03.119
Of course they're going to make it appealing.

27:03.987 --> 27:06.191
But, I think maybe there's a better job --

27:07.400 --> 27:08.422
Stay in New York.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.156
Start a family with me.

27:21.250 --> 27:22.914
I thought you needed time to think about it.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.391
I am thinking about it.

27:27.100 --> 27:30.486
Don't get too excited, Big Boy, you haven't closed the deal yet.

27:31.600 --> 27:32.715
It's looking good, isn't it?

27:37.632 --> 27:43.009
The thing is -- is I'm really thinking about this job.

27:45.050 --> 27:49.027
I mean, what if it is worth it?

27:49.911 --> 27:52.004
What if I can really make a difference?

27:52.773 --> 27:55.376
By being an 11:30 smartass on TV?

27:57.500 --> 28:01.633
Wow! OK...

28:01.683 --> 28:03.213
Look, I just know what we have.

28:04.300 --> 28:06.193
And I don't want to lose that to this...

28:06.800 --> 28:07.746
media thing.

28:08.150 --> 28:09.176
I've seen what happens to people.

28:12.500 --> 28:13.805
Correct me if I'm wrong,

28:15.050 --> 28:17.510
but this kinda sound like an either/or.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.196
It's just the way I see it.

28:40.450 --> 28:42.929
How is it that everyone in this town knows you?

28:43.815 --> 28:47.082
Well, I've been around long enough.

28:49.600 --> 28:53.721
So... not that I don't appreciate a free lunch, darling...

28:58.000 --> 28:59.552
Dad, something's not right...

29:00.250 --> 29:01.283
with the company.

29:02.654 --> 29:05.500
I can't generate new business without start-up funds.

29:05.500 --> 29:08.297
We supposedly have it, so how come I can't get a dime?

29:09.000 --> 29:10.007
I'll talk to Saul.

29:11.100 --> 29:12.199
No, I already did.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.276
Dad, I found some things...

29:15.400 --> 29:16.889
some locked accounts.

29:18.100 --> 29:20.782
If something was wrong, you would tell me, right?

29:25.300 --> 29:28.499
You'll have to promise me you won't talk to your mother about this...

29:30.000 --> 29:30.849
Of course.

29:33.800 --> 29:39.875
Saul's having some kind of -- his management of financial matters --

29:41.800 --> 29:43.465
he's failing.

29:43.700 --> 29:46.403
Failing, you mean, like he's losing his faculties?

29:46.453 --> 29:50.928
I'm not sure, I'm not sure. He's been extremely secretive, I can't get a straight answer out of him.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.400
Did he lock you out of the files, too?

29:52.400 --> 29:53.061
He did.

29:54.600 --> 29:57.251
- Dad!
- It's my mistake, I let it go on too long,

29:57.301 --> 29:58.526
but he's family.

30:03.650 --> 30:06.306
Monday, I'll talk to him. If he doesn't give me an answer --

30:08.800 --> 30:09.884
I'll do what I have to do.

30:13.400 --> 30:16.943
No, Saul, no more time! We need to have something that makes sense.

30:18.100 --> 30:18.766
Monday!

30:19.600 --> 30:21.448
William, William.

30:22.221 --> 30:24.200
Kitty and Jonathan are here.

30:24.200 --> 30:25.038
They're early.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.285
OK.

30:41.500 --> 30:44.013
So, I'm-I'm sorry if we were a little early.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.775
Things got a little tense at the hotel.

30:47.700 --> 30:49.617
That happens. Small spaces.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.318
Well, it's more that he wants to get married.

30:54.300 --> 30:55.092
He does?

30:56.000 --> 30:57.170
That's great, isn't it?

31:00.400 --> 31:05.470
Well, I'm actually a little more interested in this job than I thought I would be.

31:05.600 --> 31:10.411
Right. Well, I'm sure you'll make the right decision.

31:12.700 --> 31:13.913
You don't have an opinion, Mom?

31:14.900 --> 31:18.331
Oh, Kitty, please, please don't push me. I'm trying so hard.

31:19.300 --> 31:20.129
Yeah, I see that.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.860
I see you bending over backwards to be polite.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.862
You want my opinion if you should marry a man I barely even know?

31:27.912 --> 31:28.927
Well, it was your choice.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.800
You were the one who virtually refused to be in my life for three years,

31:32.800 --> 31:33.884
who barely spoke.

31:34.300 --> 31:37.000
And I know it's because I unforgivably gave my opinion about Justin.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.057
Not refused. Couldn't.

31:41.100 --> 31:44.596
I was afraid of the things I didn't want to say.

31:44.646 --> 31:45.679
Well, let's just say it,

31:47.567 --> 31:49.902
that I sent Justin to war, that I put him on the front lines,

31:49.952 --> 31:51.724
that's reductive, that's ridiculous!

31:51.774 --> 31:56.204
He trusted you. He asked you and you said to him --

31:56.254 --> 31:58.000
I told him the same thing I would tell him today.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.471
I told him that I was proud of him.

32:00.672 --> 32:04.793
I was there.....I was right there.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.710
I was in New York. I was six blocks away from where the Towers fell!

32:07.760 --> 32:10.000
I know where you were, Kitty. For God's sakes, you're my child.上

32:10.000 --> 32:11.504
I was terrified for you!

32:11.800 --> 32:13.170
I was on the phone with you,

32:13.700 --> 32:17.464
and then I was terrified for him. Day after day after day....

32:17.514 --> 32:23.300
You have no idea what it's like for a mother.

32:23.300 --> 32:24.557
You have no idea.

32:26.607 --> 32:31.760
And, then, you don't think about that when you go on the air and you sell your views.

32:32.788 --> 32:34.700
And now you're going to be doing it on national television.

32:34.700 --> 32:36.450
Oh, Kitty, that's just great!

32:36.500 --> 32:37.658
Really great!

32:42.650 --> 32:43.570
No, Mom...

32:45.300 --> 32:47.602
this is not just about my politics.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.700
Tommy and Dad think the same things I do, and

32:52.700 --> 32:54.200
you've managed to reconcile forty years

32:54.310 --> 32:57.174
of loving somebody who fundamentally disagrees with you.

32:59.224 --> 33:00.609
But you can't love me!

33:02.480 --> 33:05.160
And I - I don't know what it's about!

33:06.400 --> 33:07.692
But, it's not about the war.

33:24.100 --> 33:25.526
Hey, can I ask you a question?

33:26.700 --> 33:28.800
The answer is no. You can't borrow my surfboard.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.550
No, I don't have any money to lend you.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.903
And, yes, girls still think you're cute.

33:36.200 --> 33:37.012
I'm kidding.

33:37.300 --> 33:38.239
What?

33:39.200 --> 33:42.128
All right, so Dad, right? I'm at the office the other day and I saw something.

33:42.400 --> 33:43.836
Yeah? What?

33:45.200 --> 33:49.245
No, it was just this blonde lady he was, like, talking to at the office.

33:49.700 --> 33:51.500
Around lunchtime? Yesterday?

33:51.500 --> 33:51.873
Yeah.

33:52.300 --> 33:53.227
Her name's Holly Harper.

33:53.277 --> 33:55.198
She and Dad have been friends for years.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.000
Ah, so there's, like, nothing going on??

33:57.000 --> 33:57.779
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.414
They've been friends a long time.

33:59.464 --> 34:01.009
I would know if anything was going on.

34:01.850 --> 34:02.638
I work with him.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.112
You're tripping.

34:05.500 --> 34:06.413
I'm a moron.

34:16.000 --> 34:16.971
- Thanks, Sweetie.
- You're welcome.

34:22.900 --> 34:24.078
So, did Kitty and Mom have a -- ?

34:24.100 --> 34:25.585
Fight, yes. Drama.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.855
All right, listen up! A toast --

34:59.905 --> 35:04.219
to the birthday girl! To Kitty, my beautiful girl.

35:04.458 --> 35:06.865
With you home, the circle is complete.

35:08.516 --> 35:10.008
We're all here, together --

35:10.793 --> 35:15.412
and I must announce, with some trepidation you're longer grounded!

35:16.856 --> 35:18.918
When she was 14, she was grounded indefinitely.

35:19.400 --> 35:19.971
What for?

35:20.021 --> 35:22.714
Oh, it had something do with cigarettes and surf wax.

35:22.764 --> 35:25.283
And shoplifting, and a boy named Pablo!

35:25.333 --> 35:26.498
Pablo!

35:26.548 --> 35:27.856
I forgot about Pablo!

35:32.165 --> 35:33.156
Who's Pablo?

35:33.800 --> 35:35.616
A name I never want to hear again.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.493
To my little sister Kitty,

35:39.800 --> 35:43.200
who, at age 7, ate all my Girl Scout cookies, which

35:43.200 --> 35:45.800
prevented me from winning a trip to Space Camp...

35:45.800 --> 35:49.029
which completely destroyed my dream of becoming an astronaut.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.892
To Kitty, because of whom I'm always being asked to join the Log Cabin Republicans!

35:55.942 --> 35:58.252
Oh, you know what? You should. They're great. They love me.

36:00.100 --> 36:04.536
To my big sister, Kitty, who taught me how to surf and how to kiss, believe it or not!

36:04.586 --> 36:05.569
That is so not true.

36:05.619 --> 36:07.303
Justin, stop telling that story.

36:07.353 --> 36:08.218
It's not true.

36:08.900 --> 36:09.586
My Dear...

36:14.800 --> 36:19.500
To Kitty, who I will probably always violently disagree with, but...

36:19.500 --> 36:23.553
who I've never stopped loving.

36:24.900 --> 36:26.980
Not for one moment of her 38 years.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.164
Happy Birthday, Baby!

36:30.100 --> 36:30.908
Cheers.

36:32.700 --> 36:33.593
Thank you.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.382
I think you should take that job if you want it.

36:47.050 --> 36:48.204
I think I do.

36:48.700 --> 36:53.067
We fight. We..... fight.

36:54.200 --> 36:55.248
It's not the end of the world.

36:58.800 --> 36:59.897
Just come home.

37:11.650 --> 37:12.809
Planet light is steady.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.966
The light from stars always twinkles.

37:16.020 --> 37:17.446
I didn't know that.

37:18.900 --> 37:20.436
That's wonderful, Paige.

37:21.600 --> 37:22.309
What did you get her?

37:22.409 --> 37:23.136
What did you get her?

37:23.186 --> 37:23.846
I didn't get her anything.

37:25.650 --> 37:26.448
Did you take care of that thing?

37:27.047 --> 37:28.598
What was Betsy's last name?

37:28.648 --> 37:29.345
Jessical.

37:30.100 --> 37:30.943
She was a hottie!

37:31.043 --> 37:33.141
I've always liked him, if it means anything.

37:33.989 --> 37:36.177
- Did you see the picture?
- No.

37:38.900 --> 37:40.249
"Would you rather?"

37:40.299 --> 37:40.817
Yes!

37:41.200 --> 37:42.800
No way! Do not mess with --!

37:42.800 --> 37:45.277
No, no, no, no. We're not gonna play that disgusting game!

37:48.050 --> 37:48.936
Oh, it's work.

37:50.100 --> 37:50.917
Hey, Gladys.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.116
You didn't get it? I sent it through.

37:53.900 --> 37:55.702
OK, I'll just. .. Let me check my mail.

37:57.818 --> 37:59.497
I'll show you Cygnus the Swan.

38:00.450 --> 38:01.178
It's right there.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.526
Oh yeah... right --

38:06.900 --> 38:07.801
Right there.

38:08.700 --> 38:09.506
Yeah.

38:10.303 --> 38:12.440
The head of the swan is a star called Alberio.

38:13.606 --> 38:14.874
Alberio. OK.

38:14.924 --> 38:18.223
No, no, that's fine. I have a computer right here. It'll just take me a sec.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.215
OK.

38:26.141 --> 38:27.880
Gladys, I'll call you back.

38:31.202 --> 38:32.191
Pension fund?

38:42.700 --> 38:43.969
Where's all the money?

38:49.700 --> 38:50.513
Oh, God.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.263
Dad, what have you done?

38:54.800 --> 38:56.287
Mars is my favorite planet.

38:57.300 --> 38:58.894
It reminds me of you, Grandpa.

39:00.900 --> 39:01.958
Why is that?

39:02.400 --> 39:03.633
He was the god of war. 神

39:04.750 --> 39:05.959
He was a warrior.

39:06.900 --> 39:09.465
That's me, all right....god of war.神

39:15.081 --> 39:16.052
Has anyone seen Dad?

39:16.152 --> 39:17.243
Outside with Paige.

39:18.108 --> 39:19.291
Jonathan, you ready for this?

39:19.341 --> 39:23.009
Would you rather have a railroad spike permanently in your head or...

39:23.059 --> 39:26.349
take public transportation for the rest of your life?

39:26.900 --> 39:28.568
Oh, the spike. Definitely.

39:30.300 --> 39:30.782
Jonathan...

39:30.832 --> 39:32.560
All the questions cannot be for Jonathan.

39:35.045 --> 39:37.382
All right, everybody! Cake time!

39:38.050 --> 39:38.677
And there's Venus.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.827
Ah, get your grandmother, Darling.

39:41.417 --> 39:42.108
Grandpa?

39:42.158 --> 39:43.494
Get your grandmother now!

39:44.688 --> 39:45.614
Grandma??

39:46.299 --> 39:47.175
Grandma!
