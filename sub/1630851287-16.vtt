00:17.426 --> 00:19.409
has been in the back
of the panic room

00:19.428 --> 00:21.520
since before
any of you were born.

00:21.671 --> 00:23.080
Nobody knows what's in it.

00:23.098 --> 00:25.190
I have your predictions,
and whoever's closest

00:25.342 --> 00:27.084
gets all the money
in the swear jar.

00:27.086 --> 00:28.343
And that's a (bleep) ton
of money

00:28.362 --> 00:30.087
because we all love to swear.

00:30.089 --> 00:31.438
Hell yeah, we do!

00:31.590 --> 00:33.940
Fudge, yes! I don't like fudge
so that's a swear to me.

00:34.017 --> 00:36.184
If a bunch of silly snakes
pop out of that mystery can,

00:36.278 --> 00:37.778
I'm gonna be pissed.

00:37.930 --> 00:40.021
Well, I guess it depends
on how silly they are.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.689
Come on, baked beans.

00:41.784 --> 00:42.766
No, it's got to be peaches.

00:42.785 --> 00:44.268
God, I hope it's creamed corn.

00:44.361 --> 00:45.544
Whoop, whoop,
show me that soup!

00:45.695 --> 00:46.879
Dad, it's time.

00:47.030 --> 00:49.606
(chanting):
Mystery can! Mystery can!

00:49.699 --> 00:51.383
Wait! Ham, we need
your mystery can guess.

00:51.493 --> 00:54.219
Oh, yeah, I forgot
we were doing this. (laughs)

00:54.446 --> 00:56.388
I've been so busy lately
with my volunteer hours

00:56.540 --> 00:58.724
at the senior home,
I've barely even seen Crispin.

00:58.875 --> 01:01.226
And of course he's also been
super busy since he was promoted

01:01.378 --> 01:03.136
to assistant boss manager
at Smoothie Boss.

01:03.289 --> 01:06.732
The supplemental blender
training is really intense.

01:06.883 --> 01:08.550
Joey Valdez nearly
lost a finger.

01:08.718 --> 01:09.976
That's the job.

01:10.129 --> 01:11.478
I'm sorry, Ham.
Being separated

01:11.630 --> 01:13.572
from your first true love
can be tough,

01:13.741 --> 01:15.908
even if it's just
for some supplemental blending.

01:16.059 --> 01:17.743
Oh. (sputters)
It's okay, Dad. We're fine.

01:17.894 --> 01:20.079
And at least I enjoy my work
at the retirement home.

01:20.230 --> 01:21.563
They love
when I bring them a cake.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.416
Nothing blows an old person's
mind like a cake.

01:24.568 --> 01:26.643
Yeah. I made one
for tonight's bingo game

01:26.645 --> 01:28.587
that combines two
of the seniors' favorite things:

01:28.738 --> 01:30.497
gambling and grandchildren,

01:30.649 --> 01:32.983
and it's called
"A Bingo Caked My Baby."

01:33.152 --> 01:34.409
Speaking of eating babies.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.986
You know what?
I don't need a segue

01:36.004 --> 01:37.487
or permission
to change the subject.

01:37.506 --> 01:39.172
I'm going
to my first pottery class

01:39.325 --> 01:41.249
at Kilnin' It!
pottery studio tonight.

01:41.327 --> 01:44.845
Ah, a new artistic medium
for our budding Brandy Warhol.

01:44.997 --> 01:46.939
Our Lady-nardo da Vinci.

01:47.166 --> 01:48.273
Pauletta Picasso.

01:48.425 --> 01:50.016
You know there are
women artists, right?

01:50.111 --> 01:51.668
Sorry. We got carried away.

01:51.687 --> 01:54.596
And now, without further ado,
the mystery can!

01:54.615 --> 01:57.098
-(gasps) Good God, the smell!
-Why, Dad? Why?

01:57.192 --> 01:59.785
-(overlapping chatter)
-I'm gonna chop my nose off!

01:59.936 --> 02:01.603
-HAM: The devil is in the can!
-(Beef grunts)

02:01.680 --> 02:04.348
Okay, great. I'll just
burn the house down,

02:04.366 --> 02:06.199
and the smell will be all gone.

02:06.352 --> 02:07.534
<i> HAM:</i>
<i> Who wants a piece</i>

02:07.686 --> 02:08.869
of delicious baby?

02:08.963 --> 02:10.036
I'll take some arm.

02:10.189 --> 02:11.630
-Mm-hmm.
-Hey, there, mister.

02:11.781 --> 02:12.873
Why don't you, uh, at least

02:13.041 --> 02:14.466
let me hold
that flimsy cardboard

02:14.693 --> 02:15.876
while you chop up that baby?

02:16.044 --> 02:17.878
(laughs) Thanks.
Goldie, right?

02:18.030 --> 02:19.546
Uh-huh. Got a platter
back in my room

02:19.698 --> 02:20.788
if you got a moment.

02:20.883 --> 02:23.124
Sure. I've got nothing but time.

02:23.144 --> 02:24.701
We get it, kid-- you're young.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.729
You don't have to be a B hole
about it. Follow me.

02:29.299 --> 02:30.798
(gasps)

02:30.818 --> 02:32.800
Mounds of terra cotta clay?

02:32.820 --> 02:34.895
Adults exploring
their artistic side?

02:35.047 --> 02:36.321
A grown man in overalls?!

02:36.548 --> 02:38.157
It's exactly what I pictured!

02:38.325 --> 02:40.066
Oh, hey.
You must be Judy.

02:40.219 --> 02:42.068
Go ahead and have a seat
at any available wheel,

02:42.163 --> 02:43.478
and we'll get started.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.390
My own wheel?
Speak to me, mistress.

02:46.408 --> 02:48.667
All right, couple ground rules
before we begin.

02:48.818 --> 02:50.394
Remember, the important thing is

02:50.412 --> 02:52.671
you have to keep making
and making and making.

02:52.898 --> 02:54.656
Second thing is,
even though I'm flattered,

02:54.750 --> 02:56.175
I'm in a committed relationship

02:56.326 --> 02:59.903
with my partners Wintergreen
and Mike so I cannot Swayze you.

02:59.996 --> 03:01.254
Okay,
but could you sit behind me

03:01.407 --> 03:03.089
and sort of put your arms
around me

03:03.242 --> 03:04.533
while we make a bowl together?

03:04.668 --> 03:06.743
Melinda, that's Swayze-ing,
and you know it.

03:06.836 --> 03:07.835
Damn it.

03:07.930 --> 03:09.930
Now everyone,
silence your minds

03:10.082 --> 03:13.025
so that you may hear the song
of the clay.

03:13.252 --> 03:15.252
♪<i> Ah, ah, ah-ah.</i> ♪

03:15.421 --> 03:17.845
I'm you, Judy,
and you're me,

03:17.865 --> 03:20.848
and together,
we're beautiful.

03:20.926 --> 03:22.092
I am home.

03:22.110 --> 03:23.276
<i> HAM:</i>
<i> Wow,</i>

03:23.429 --> 03:25.429
Goldie,
those dishes are delicious.

03:25.522 --> 03:27.447
Oh, you like my dish collection?

03:27.541 --> 03:29.691
A lot of them were
from my husband Paul.

03:29.785 --> 03:31.359
He's dead now.
He was a writer.

03:31.437 --> 03:33.437
Wow! What did he write?
Poetry? Novels?

03:33.439 --> 03:37.107
Oh, the heating instructions
for all sorts of food products.

03:37.167 --> 03:40.110
"Let cool before eating."
That was his idea.

03:40.203 --> 03:42.946
Before that, people were burning
their mouths all the time.

03:42.965 --> 03:45.206
I had to sell most of the dishes
he bought me

03:45.342 --> 03:47.117
when I moved in here and, uh,

03:47.135 --> 03:49.228
because I don't throw
my freak-outs anymore.

03:49.379 --> 03:51.713
That's what everyone used
to call my wild parties.

03:51.807 --> 03:53.214
Oh, you would've loved it, Ham.

03:53.234 --> 03:55.642
I loved to bake, too,
and I'd make a bunch of stuff

03:55.794 --> 03:56.960
that sounds pretty gross now,

03:57.053 --> 03:58.645
but was considered hip
at the time.

03:58.797 --> 04:01.907
Weineroni casseroles,
bananas hollandaise,

04:02.058 --> 04:03.467
my seven-liver dip.

04:03.485 --> 04:05.911
Oh, and Paul and I would always
do a special dance.

04:06.138 --> 04:08.229
(whistles)
Wouldn't kick this dish

04:08.249 --> 04:10.249
out of bed for serving crackers.

04:10.476 --> 04:12.476
Oh, that was a special platter
I got

04:12.569 --> 04:15.312
for my sweet Paul's
70th birthday freak-out,

04:15.330 --> 04:17.572
but then he died suddenly at 69,

04:17.741 --> 04:20.092
which he would have liked
because he loved 69 jokes,

04:20.243 --> 04:23.987
but he couldn't enjoy it
because, again, he was dead.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.080
And all the plans I had
for that plate

04:26.100 --> 04:28.583
and that party just, pfft,
dried up, blew away.

04:28.677 --> 04:30.385
That was almost
ten years ago.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.271
His birthday's coming up
in a few days.

04:32.498 --> 04:33.847
Oh, I could make a cake
for his birthday,

04:33.999 --> 04:35.515
and we could raise a glass
to him.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.092
Or... maybe...

04:38.186 --> 04:40.837
No, no, no, we couldn't.

04:40.930 --> 04:43.356
-We shouldn't!
-Shouldn't what?

04:43.509 --> 04:44.932
Just, well... I don't know.

04:45.027 --> 04:47.360
It's too crazy,
but we could...

04:47.454 --> 04:50.514
We could throw Paul's freak-out,
the whole party.

04:50.532 --> 04:53.199
Oh, no, no, no.
You know what? Never mind.

04:53.294 --> 04:54.776
Forget I said it. Dumb idea!

04:54.986 --> 04:56.962
I'm a dumb old lady
with a dumb mouth.

04:57.113 --> 04:59.205
What? No! It's not dumb!

04:59.358 --> 05:01.449
I've got plenty of free time
right now to help you

05:01.468 --> 05:04.210
because my boyfriend is busy
with blender training.

05:04.363 --> 05:06.530
Okay, Ham, if you insist.

05:06.548 --> 05:08.198
Did you hear that, Paul?

05:08.291 --> 05:09.975
We're having your birthday party
this weekend.

05:10.052 --> 05:12.602
So tell your boring
heaven friends you're busy!

05:16.132 --> 05:19.042
Morning, Judy.
What's that you've got there?

05:19.061 --> 05:20.210
A handful of toilet paper?

05:20.303 --> 05:21.320
It's my very first
handmade mug!

05:21.547 --> 05:22.395
Go ahead, Father.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.215
-Fill it with coffee!
-Okay.

05:25.384 --> 05:26.641
Aah! I see.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.827
All I have to do is put my thumb
on the hole like so.

05:28.978 --> 05:31.571
Or drink it
from the hole like so.

05:31.723 --> 05:34.315
Ah. Oh, what a novel
drinking experience, Judy.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.743
It's lots of fun for my mouth.

05:36.895 --> 05:38.503
I know it's not perfect,
but Kurt says

05:38.730 --> 05:41.173
a flawed mug is just like
a flawed person-- beautiful.

05:41.324 --> 05:43.900
Nonsense. This is a great mug.

05:43.993 --> 05:46.236
I just need to work on myself
to be able to use it.

05:46.329 --> 05:49.239
Aw, I feel awful I don't have
a mug for each of you,

05:49.257 --> 05:50.907
but don't worry.
I'm going back tonight,

05:50.967 --> 05:53.076
and I'm gonna birth
some new pieces!

05:53.095 --> 05:54.744
Oh. (laughs) Ah, terrific!

05:54.746 --> 05:57.247
Why don't you guys just
tell Judy her cup is bad?

05:57.265 --> 05:58.915
Oh, we try not
to discourage her.

05:58.934 --> 06:00.842
When she was four,
I didn't put her drawing

06:00.919 --> 06:02.769
of a cat on the fridge,
and for a week,

06:02.863 --> 06:04.696
she walked around the house
in a bathrobe,

06:04.773 --> 06:07.090
sighing and pretending to smoke.

06:07.183 --> 06:08.850
Well, maybe she'll get better?

06:08.869 --> 06:10.944
Either that,
or we get better at lying.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.929
<i> HAM:</i>
<i> I knew</i>
<i> training was gonna be tough,</i>

06:12.948 --> 06:14.280
but your poor finger.

06:14.433 --> 06:15.857
Oh, it's just
to protect it during the day

06:15.876 --> 06:17.283
so I can get back
to blending tonight.

06:17.436 --> 06:19.378
Yeah, I've got
a pretty big night planned, too.

06:19.546 --> 06:22.439
I'm helping my senior friend,
Goldie, plan a party.

06:22.532 --> 06:23.456
Oh, that reminds me!

06:23.625 --> 06:25.217
We're having a party
on Saturday night.

06:25.368 --> 06:27.386
You'll have to come, too. We'll
finally get to hang out again.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.462
Okay, got to motor.
PE's all the way across school,

06:29.615 --> 06:30.889
and I need
to walk extra careful

06:31.040 --> 06:32.540
so my finger doesn't bump
into anyone.

06:32.709 --> 06:33.892
Goodbye, alligator.

06:34.043 --> 06:35.635
And a good day
to you, crocodile.

06:35.787 --> 06:37.971
I knew you guys were watching
<i> Stranger Things</i> tonight

06:38.123 --> 06:40.732
so I brought a pineapple
The Upside Down cake.

06:40.884 --> 06:42.401
Looks delicious.

06:42.628 --> 06:43.977
Wait 'till you see
what I have planned

06:44.129 --> 06:45.145
for Goldie's big party. Ow!

06:45.239 --> 06:46.630
-Her what?
-Goldie!

06:46.723 --> 06:49.649
Oh, is it that time already?
Ham, you come with me.

06:49.801 --> 06:52.226
Sorry. We've got to get him
to his drug counseling

06:52.246 --> 06:54.579
because
of how he's addicted to drugs.

06:54.806 --> 06:56.731
He's been smoking Tide bongs

06:56.750 --> 06:59.734
with his no-good friends
down by the railroad tracks.

06:59.828 --> 07:03.255
Okay, we-we better, uh, uh...
Yeah, we-we got to go. Bye.

07:03.482 --> 07:05.757
-Goldie, what in the world?!
-Shut it.

07:05.984 --> 07:07.926
No talking about the party
in front of the fuzz.

07:08.077 --> 07:11.154
Okay, so I should have
mentioned this earlier,

07:11.173 --> 07:13.932
but it's not exactly cool
to throw the birthday freak-out

07:14.083 --> 07:15.767
-here at the old people's home.
-Why?

07:15.919 --> 07:18.937
Well, I might have thrown
a little shindig my first week

07:19.088 --> 07:21.273
that resulted in some damaged
medical equipment.

07:21.424 --> 07:25.277
A couple of people had an IV
bag fight. That's not my fault!

07:25.428 --> 07:27.946
So this party is...
against the rules?

07:28.097 --> 07:31.450
(scoffs)
At my age, I consider all rules
to just be suggestions,

07:31.601 --> 07:34.360
and most of them
suggestions I do not like.

07:34.513 --> 07:37.847
Well, if we can't do it here,
where are we gonna throw it?

07:37.866 --> 07:40.441
Oh, I got a venue in mind.
I'll show you tomorrow.

07:40.535 --> 07:43.945
But if<i> you're</i> having
second thoughts, you know what?

07:43.964 --> 07:46.873
I-I'll just light a candle
for Paul here

07:47.025 --> 07:48.374
all alone in my room

07:48.469 --> 07:51.953
and say his name softly
into the darkness, like this.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.454
(sadly):
"Paul."

07:53.548 --> 07:56.975
Uh-uh, Goldie. Paul may have
69'd his way into heaven,

07:57.202 --> 07:58.977
but this weekend, he turns 70.

07:59.204 --> 08:00.795
So, where's our first stop?

08:00.872 --> 08:02.222
Let's hit
the party supply store.

08:02.316 --> 08:03.482
Then we can go see
my friend Mark

08:03.558 --> 08:04.816
-and buy some cocai...
-(phone chimes)

08:05.043 --> 08:07.134
Crispin, huh?
Is that your mister?

08:07.154 --> 08:09.212
-You want to write him back?
-Yeah, I do,

08:09.305 --> 08:10.638
but our dad always says

08:10.657 --> 08:12.382
if he ever catches us texting
while driving,

08:12.400 --> 08:13.883
our next call should be
to the news to see

08:13.902 --> 08:16.310
if they want to interview
the most grounded child alive.

08:16.388 --> 08:17.979
-Smart man.
-I'll just text him back later.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.499
That's what you do
in relationships now, huh?

08:20.667 --> 08:24.394
You just send each other emojis
and pictures of your butts?

08:24.412 --> 08:25.578
You ever dance?

08:25.731 --> 08:28.064
Yeah, we actually fell in love
at a dance.

08:28.066 --> 08:30.342
But we're both just
really busy these days.

08:30.493 --> 08:32.677
Wait! Stop!
Stop here! Pull over!

08:32.829 --> 08:35.329
Goldie! Hey, uh, uh, come back?

08:35.423 --> 08:37.907
Oh, man,
I'm gonna lose a senior.

08:37.926 --> 08:40.167
Oh, hot dang!
The ducks are here.

08:40.262 --> 08:42.687
-I've never seen
this spot before.
-(ducks quacking)

08:42.914 --> 08:44.247
It's so beautiful.

08:44.340 --> 08:47.417
Oh, yeah, the pond is only
unfrozen a few days a year.

08:47.435 --> 08:48.918
I used to drag Paul away
from his desk

08:48.937 --> 08:50.177
so we wouldn't miss it.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.679
Too bad
your boyfriend's missing it.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.590
Well, he said he's coming
to the party this weekend.

08:53.608 --> 08:55.458
But what if you got murdered
before then, Ham?

08:55.460 --> 08:57.018
Have you thought about that?

08:57.037 --> 08:58.444
Are you gonna murder me, Goldie?

08:58.597 --> 09:00.947
Nah, I don't have
the upper body strength.

09:01.099 --> 09:03.875
-Ah, I love it here.
-I can see why.

09:04.102 --> 09:05.118
I'm glad we stopped.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.936
What are you doing, Ham?
Don't sit down.

09:07.030 --> 09:09.030
We got to go shopping
for the party. Come on!

09:09.107 --> 09:11.716
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Keep up!

09:11.868 --> 09:14.127
So, what does everyone think?

09:14.221 --> 09:15.945
Oh, I love my fork!

09:15.947 --> 09:17.872
-It's a candle holder.
-Sure is!

09:17.966 --> 09:19.949
I was just gonna make one thing
last night,

09:20.043 --> 09:22.877
but the studio really
inspires me.

09:22.971 --> 09:24.470
That wheel was a-spinning,

09:24.565 --> 09:26.547
and Kurt was doing
his Norwegian yoik singing.

09:26.641 --> 09:27.882
And the next thing you knew,

09:27.901 --> 09:29.976
I'd made enough pottery
to fill a barn.

09:30.128 --> 09:32.237
And I love my pink... thing.

09:32.388 --> 09:34.055
-Picture frame!
-Oh!

09:34.074 --> 09:35.574
Okay. Mm-hmm.

09:35.801 --> 09:37.058
Moon? Any thoughts?

09:37.077 --> 09:39.152
This was given
to me by my sister.

09:39.304 --> 09:41.137
And Dad, do you like yours?

09:41.230 --> 09:43.081
Uh, well, it will be very fun

09:43.232 --> 09:45.083
to eat food off this plate,
Judy.

09:45.234 --> 09:47.827
Look how tiny my hamburger looks
in this landscape.

09:47.904 --> 09:50.088
I'm glad you guys love your
gifts, cause there's gonna be

09:50.239 --> 09:51.648
more, more, more
where that came from!

09:51.666 --> 09:54.484
Terrific. Now where did
my tater tots go?

09:54.577 --> 09:58.579
Oh, they've fallen into the hole
in the middle of my plate. Neat.

09:58.599 --> 10:01.991
-Okay, where to now?
-Ooh, turn off here, Ham!

10:02.085 --> 10:04.677
-What's this?
-That party venue
I told you about.

10:04.830 --> 10:07.439
This is my house.
My actual house, that I own.

10:07.590 --> 10:11.109
I just have to sleep at that
old people's storage facility.

10:11.336 --> 10:13.336
Well, it looks
like it was gorgeous,

10:13.355 --> 10:15.338
but it doesn't seem... safe?

10:15.431 --> 10:19.025
I just wish
I could celebrate here once more

10:19.119 --> 10:21.286
before I... you know.
(guttural grunting)

10:21.513 --> 10:25.181
(gasps)
Goldie, you're dying?

10:25.274 --> 10:27.033
Oh, it's okay, Ham.
I'm not afraid.

10:27.110 --> 10:30.128
-I've had a good life.
-Oh, what the hell.

10:30.355 --> 10:31.704
It can't hurt to throw
a little party in there.

10:31.857 --> 10:34.799
-It's just a couple hours.
-That's the spirit.

10:35.026 --> 10:36.968
Now, We just need to figure out
how to get 23 old people here

10:37.195 --> 10:38.862
from the old people place.

10:38.955 --> 10:41.381
Um, I think Junkyard Kyle has
a bunch of old busses.

10:41.533 --> 10:43.475
Great! These seniors will be
so excited to take a ride

I just wanted to say, I realize

11:14.065 --> 11:15.415
that some of my early attempts
at ceramics

11:15.567 --> 11:17.509
might have been a little...
not great.

-Correct.

-It's a ceramic jacket,
and you just put it on like so.
-Mm.

Hey, what does that say
on the lapel there?

11:42.944 --> 11:45.537
Oh, it says "Slammin'!"
Isn't that cool?

11:45.706 --> 11:48.598
-Oh, God. Got to sit down.
-Now, where's Ham?

11:48.616 --> 11:50.283

getting ready

at the senior home.

Oh, great. I'm gonna go
give him his gift.

It's ceramic shorts that say
"Slammin'!" on the pockets.

Can someone help me
get my head up?

they added hours

can you look

12:23.927 --> 12:25.468
for my lucky pinecone
at your house?

12:25.561 --> 12:27.895
It looks like a pinecone,

Wait. Whoa. A tuxedo?

Wowee, wow-wow. I thought
you were volunteering tonight.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.356
Thanks. I made it myself.

13:20.375 --> 13:21.707
My granddaughter Amanda used

13:21.802 --> 13:24.377

Like me and Paul used to do.

13:38.726 --> 13:41.319
Uh, but we didn't plan anything,
Goldie. We didn't practice.

13:41.470 --> 13:43.212
You don't have
to practice a dance.

13:43.306 --> 13:45.214
I've literally
never heard of that.

13:45.308 --> 13:46.899
All right, Goldie. Let's dance.

13:47.052 --> 13:48.901
That's the spirit.
You want a little cocaine?

13:49.054 --> 13:51.404
-Goldie!
-Kidding! I couldn't get any.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.406
Turns out
my guy went back to school.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.893
He's an art historian now.
I am so proud of him.

13:56.911 --> 13:58.394
WOLF:
Okay, so what's the plan?

13:58.487 --> 14:00.654
Do we just go in there
and start smashing pottery

14:00.748 --> 14:02.231
and say "Judy's out!"? Oh!

14:02.400 --> 14:03.991
We could do Italian accents so
he thinks we're in the Mafia.

14:04.201 --> 14:06.569
Great idea, son, but maybe
we should just tell him

14:06.662 --> 14:09.238
that because I don't have
the strength to tell my daughter

14:09.332 --> 14:11.240
she's bad at ceramics,
he has to do it.

14:11.334 --> 14:13.076
Or-- wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

14:13.244 --> 14:14.853
Moon is really good
at throwing his voice.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.762
Maybe he could do it
into one of the pots.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.506
And Kurt will be so freaked out,
he'll never let her come back.

14:19.601 --> 14:23.177
(slowly):
Judy... is evil.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.755
Guys,
Judy is spending money here,

14:25.773 --> 14:27.514
so we're gonna have
to offer this guy cash,

14:27.534 --> 14:30.351
or we could offer him a cool
experience instead of money,

14:30.445 --> 14:33.037
like a massage,
or a gnocchi-making class.

14:33.264 --> 14:34.597
An outside-the-box idea--

14:34.690 --> 14:37.283
We frame him for murder,
and his store gets shut down.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.602
Look, this Kurt guy
and the power of ceramics

14:39.604 --> 14:41.212
are obviously
pretty overwhelming,

14:41.439 --> 14:44.549
so let's just go in there,
throw all this stuff at him,

14:44.700 --> 14:45.791
and hope something works.

14:45.944 --> 14:47.719
Greetings, new friends. I...

14:47.946 --> 14:49.404

It's a-me, Mario.

14:49.464 --> 14:50.889
Uh, my a-sister-- she's out

14:51.116 --> 14:53.558
-of the pottery business.
Uh, capice?
-Um...

14:53.709 --> 14:55.785
Instead of money,
we're gonna give you a massage.

14:55.878 --> 14:58.137
-What?
-(eerie voice): Judy is evil.

14:58.289 --> 15:00.214

what any of that meant,

15:00.233 --> 15:01.791

I was supposed

16:10.453 --> 16:12.470
to throw many years ago
for my sweetheart, Paul,

16:12.621 --> 16:16.048
but then, two days before
his birthday, out of nowhere,

16:16.142 --> 16:19.126
like a real ding-dong,
he kicked the bucket.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.645

16:28.822 --> 16:32.156
well, just give us a sign
if you liked your party.

16:32.308 --> 16:34.141
(rumbling, screaming)

16:34.160 --> 16:35.901
Uh, o-okay, Paul,
that's enough sign.

16:36.054 --> 16:37.720
-You can stop now.
-JUDY: Oh, God!

16:37.722 --> 16:40.147
Get out of my way! I have
to protect my bowls! My vessels!

16:40.166 --> 16:41.482
Aah! Call 911!

16:41.501 --> 16:43.501
Everyone please just walk
to the nearest exit!

16:43.728 --> 16:46.729
-(screaming)
-Or, yes,
panicking is fine, too.

16:46.731 --> 16:48.089
Whatever works for you.

16:51.402 --> 16:54.178
Well, looks like I could charge
you with breaking and entering.

16:54.330 --> 16:56.848
Breaking and entering?
But Goldie owns the house.

16:56.999 --> 16:59.183
-Well...
-Goldie!

16:59.335 --> 17:01.019
I had to sell it
after Paul died.

17:01.246 --> 17:02.520
(sighs)
Goldie.

17:02.671 --> 17:04.914
So, how many years
are we staring down, Officer?

17:04.932 --> 17:06.024
I can take it.

17:06.251 --> 17:08.100
Well, I mean,
this is pretty serious.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.695
You're going away
for a long, long time.

17:10.846 --> 17:12.755
-What?
-(Goldie gasps)
-(laughs) No, that's not true.

17:12.774 --> 17:15.867
But saying that aloud has
always been a dream of mine.

17:16.094 --> 17:18.444
Listen, Edna,
I know we made a mistake,

17:18.596 --> 17:20.930
but we only did this
because Goldie's dying.

17:21.023 --> 17:24.691
-Well...
-Goldie! You lied about dying?

17:24.711 --> 17:28.362
I mean, we're all dying, Ham,
except Benjamin Buttons.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.607
But, no,
I'm not dying, like, now.

17:31.700 --> 17:34.610
Goldie, you manipulated me
to break the law.

17:34.612 --> 17:36.036
That's terrible!

17:36.056 --> 17:38.705
And his name was "Benjamin
Button," not "Buttons!"

17:38.874 --> 17:42.042
And he did die. He just aged in
reverse and then died as a baby.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.228
Oh, I got to take this.
It's the homeowners.

17:44.380 --> 17:47.123
Don't you dare say anything good
until I come back.

17:47.125 --> 17:49.975
-You mad?
-Yes, kind of!

17:50.128 --> 17:52.052
Goldie, we're in big trouble.

17:52.146 --> 17:54.221
And we could've been crushed
by the ceiling.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.223
But we weren't,
and we did some living!

17:56.317 --> 17:57.724
Well, the people
who own the house

17:57.744 --> 17:58.968
aren't gonna press charges.

17:58.986 --> 18:00.244
Place is due
to be demolished anyway.

18:00.396 --> 18:03.139
-Let's get you back.
-Demolished, huh?

18:03.308 --> 18:04.657
-I'm afraid so.
-Okay.

18:04.809 --> 18:08.735
Just give me a moment
with the house to say goodbye?

18:08.755 --> 18:10.496
Bye, Paul.

18:10.648 --> 18:13.316
This freak... is out.

18:13.334 --> 18:15.117
<i> BEEF:</i>
<i> Well, I do not think</i>

18:15.169 --> 18:18.078
we got the message through
to him about Judy.

18:18.172 --> 18:20.489
But we did all sign up
for daily pottery classes.

18:20.583 --> 18:23.417
And the 14-day pottery retreat
in Tahoe.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.177
Well, let's just call
and cancel.

18:25.330 --> 18:27.346
-First thing in the morning.
-Right, and if we are still

18:27.440 --> 18:29.590
interested in ceramics,
I could just

18:29.609 --> 18:31.776
build a little pottery studio
in the backyard.

18:31.927 --> 18:34.445
Or we could just go back
to the ceramics place tomorrow?

18:34.597 --> 18:36.672
-Yeah, yeah, let's do that.
-Yes. Yes.
-Yes.

18:36.765 --> 18:38.357
I miss Kurt. Do you think
we could call him?

18:38.509 --> 18:40.176
I bet he's in the phone book.

18:40.194 --> 18:42.769
HAM:
You know, you didn't have
to lie to me.

18:42.864 --> 18:45.514
About the house
and, um, about dying.

18:45.533 --> 18:49.352
I'm sorry. I-I guess
I just wanted to make sure

18:49.370 --> 18:51.687
I got one more night
at my house.

18:51.780 --> 18:53.856
With my memories, with Paul.

18:53.875 --> 18:55.858
I never even got to say goodbye,
you know?

18:55.877 --> 18:59.303
We were both in great health.
We thought we'd live to be 115,

18:59.455 --> 19:01.547
and then poof, he was just gone.

19:01.699 --> 19:03.048
You know, it's funny.

19:03.201 --> 19:04.475
We've been together
all week,

19:04.702 --> 19:06.960
and I've never even seen
this boyfriend of yours.

19:07.054 --> 19:08.888
Well, he's had work.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.539
Yeah, Paul used
to work a lot, too.

19:10.633 --> 19:13.800
In fact, we were gonna have
his freak-out the week before,

19:13.895 --> 19:16.212
but he had a big assignment
pop up-- an impossible deadline

19:16.230 --> 19:18.547
on instructions for
a double-decker waffle maker.

19:18.566 --> 19:21.141
So I rescheduled,
and then look what happened.

19:21.235 --> 19:22.735
You know what happened?
I'm gonna tell ya.

19:22.887 --> 19:24.920
-He died.
-Yeah, he died.

19:25.056 --> 19:28.224
Yes! You can't wait for the
special moments to come to you.

19:28.242 --> 19:29.742
You have to make them, Ham.

19:29.894 --> 19:31.227
If you don't,
you could miss them,

19:31.320 --> 19:33.245
just like
I missed Paul's birthday.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.655
I'm sure he knew you loved him.

19:34.823 --> 19:37.508
Yeah, I showed him in
little ways, like buying flowers

19:37.735 --> 19:39.844
and installing a mirror
on our bedroom ceiling,

19:39.995 --> 19:42.254
but boy, what I'd give
for one more day.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.997
I know
you and Crispin are young,

19:44.017 --> 19:46.242
but life goes faster
than you think,

19:46.260 --> 19:48.519
and the one thing
you can't count on is more time.

19:48.671 --> 19:51.171
Sometimes things in life
come out of nowhere,

19:51.191 --> 19:53.191
and you don't want
to have regrets.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.751
Now, what do you think
you need to do?

19:55.770 --> 19:57.511
-Go to Crispin.
-Yes!

19:57.605 --> 20:00.940
-But first, drop Judy at home!
-Okay!

20:01.092 --> 20:02.349
And then I need to get some gas.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.702
But after that,
I'll go to him.

20:04.929 --> 20:07.112
Attaboy.
Oh, and also walk me in.

20:07.265 --> 20:09.740
It's a little icy.
I don't want to slip and fall.

20:09.967 --> 20:12.359
I'm still planning
to live to be 115.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.212
I know
Paul's gonna wait for me.

20:14.363 --> 20:18.716
He's just up there putting a
mirror on our ceiling in heaven.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.869
-Hamuel?
-Hi.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.114
-You're here.
-So are you.

20:25.132 --> 20:27.058
What a coincidence.

20:27.209 --> 20:28.893
Do you have anywhere
you need to go now?

20:29.044 --> 20:30.377
-Yeah.
-Oh.

20:30.471 --> 20:32.788
Oh, no, no, no. I-I mean,
wherever you're going.

20:32.807 --> 20:33.973
Okay, cool.

20:34.125 --> 20:36.067
Thanks for picking me up.

20:36.218 --> 20:37.643
Thanks for letting me
pick you up.

20:37.795 --> 20:41.572
Well, thanks for being thankful
to me for picking me up.

20:41.724 --> 20:45.576
-Sorry it took so long.
-You were right on time.

20:47.062 --> 20:50.248
Wow. Ugh. This is gross.
What's in it?

20:50.399 --> 20:53.567
Oh, uh, whipped cream,
sausages and horseradish.

20:53.661 --> 20:56.328
-Should we throw it away?
-Yes, yes. Absolutely, yes.
