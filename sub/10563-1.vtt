01:16.693 --> 01:18.558
Give it to me straight.

01:18.995 --> 01:21.020
Virginal bride, or...

01:21.197 --> 01:22.960
...slut in white? Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

01:23.133 --> 01:25.226
He is so lucky.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.841
You okay in there?

01:39.516 --> 01:40.540
I feel sick.

01:40.717 --> 01:42.344
Oh.

01:43.052 --> 01:45.020
You're getting nervous.

01:45.722 --> 01:48.782
You remember last year when Jesse
and I broke up for a couple of weeks...

01:48.958 --> 01:52.416
...and, uh, I thought she spent
those two weeks in bed...

01:52.595 --> 01:54.187
...sad and depressed?

01:54.364 --> 01:57.162
- Yeah.
- This morning she tells me...

01:57.333 --> 02:00.769
...out of the blue that she spent
one of those weeks in bed with Jake Lee.

02:01.337 --> 02:04.238
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

02:04.941 --> 02:09.002
Good. That's good. So, what's wrong?

02:09.179 --> 02:11.306
She slept with Jake Lee.

02:11.481 --> 02:13.210
She slept with him for like a week.

02:13.750 --> 02:17.777
How am I supposed to live with that?
What if all this is a mistake?

02:17.987 --> 02:19.750
Come on,
you would've known that by now.

02:19.923 --> 02:22.983
- Am I overreacting?
- Yes, you are.

02:23.159 --> 02:25.423
Come on, man,
it's not like she actually cheated.

02:25.595 --> 02:28.155
I mean, you know, you had broken up.

02:28.531 --> 02:29.725
Right.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.633
What would you do?

02:32.902 --> 02:35.530
I'd be happy, man. Ha, ha.

02:35.772 --> 02:38.900
I mean, it's Jesse.
Everyone you know wants Jesse.

02:39.075 --> 02:42.044
- What do you mean by that?
- I didn't... I didn't...

02:42.212 --> 02:45.340
Ahem. I didn't mean it like that.
I just, uh...

02:45.882 --> 02:49.113
Look, you wanted this, right?

02:49.285 --> 02:53.415
So, pull yourself together,
go out there and get married.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.130
Ed?

03:07.303 --> 03:08.998
Mr. Allen.

03:09.639 --> 03:12.574
You caught me reminiscing.
A lot of memories here.

03:12.742 --> 03:14.175
Buy you a drink?

03:14.344 --> 03:17.905
Oh, I'd love to, Frank, but I'm kind of...
I'm in a bit of a rush.

03:18.081 --> 03:19.343
I insist.

03:19.782 --> 03:22.979
After all, it is the traditional function
of the father of the bride.

03:23.152 --> 03:24.312
What is?

03:24.487 --> 03:26.352
Keeping the groom away from back exits.

03:26.522 --> 03:30.720
No, I was just gonna go outside,
get some air.

03:30.894 --> 03:33.522
Your best tequila, on the rocks.
Come over here a second.

03:33.696 --> 03:36.062
- It's tequila, right?
- Uh, none for me, thanks.

03:36.232 --> 03:38.063
That's great. He'll have a double.

03:38.234 --> 03:40.862
You know, I realize that you don't
know me very well, Ed.

03:41.037 --> 03:44.006
You and Jesse down at school,
my wife and I here, but trust me...

03:44.173 --> 03:45.231
...you can talk to me.

03:45.942 --> 03:48.410
Nothing really to talk about, sir.

03:48.745 --> 03:50.042
Doubts?

03:50.213 --> 03:53.239
No, no. No doubts.
Uh, no doubt in my mind.

03:53.416 --> 03:56.579
I'm totally doubt-free.
I'm, uh... I'm doubtless.

03:56.753 --> 03:58.345
Yeah.

03:58.922 --> 04:01.220
I'll tell you what. Ahem.

04:01.958 --> 04:05.325
Why don't we make a little list, shall we?

04:05.495 --> 04:07.554
Let's start with doubt number one.

04:07.730 --> 04:09.197
Uh, none.

04:09.365 --> 04:12.823
No, I promise. None.
Uh, number one is "none."

04:13.002 --> 04:15.937
Oh, come on, we can do better than that.

04:16.105 --> 04:17.868
What about that thing with Jake Lee?

04:20.108 --> 04:23.010
- She told you that?
- Two weeks, last year.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.840
Two weeks? She told me a week.

04:25.014 --> 04:29.383
One, two, most of Lent,
that's hardly the point.

04:29.552 --> 04:31.713
That's not why you're eyeing the exit.

04:31.888 --> 04:33.981
Jake Lee's an excuse.

04:34.991 --> 04:37.255
Tell me something, Ed.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.453
Do you love her?

04:41.531 --> 04:43.431
Yeah, of course I do.

04:43.599 --> 04:45.863
Then maybe, just maybe,
you're wondering...

04:46.035 --> 04:48.196
...why it isn't pure and constant.

04:48.371 --> 04:51.738
Why all of these ups and downs.
Conviction, then doubt?

04:51.908 --> 04:54.775
How can something that feels
so right one moment...

04:54.944 --> 04:57.538
...make you so queasy the next?

04:59.449 --> 05:00.780
Relax.

05:00.950 --> 05:03.009
Life is a mess.

05:03.753 --> 05:08.781
All you have to do is choose to love her
the best way that you know how.

05:09.058 --> 05:11.959
You know,
I've really gotta get out of here. Um...

05:12.128 --> 05:14.119
Thank you for the advice and the drink...

05:14.297 --> 05:17.289
You know, I've had a marriage
of ups and downs.

05:17.467 --> 05:18.729
Oof.

05:18.901 --> 05:22.928
Dazzling extremes. Perhaps you've
never heard the full account?

05:23.106 --> 05:26.303
Frankly, Frank, another time.

05:26.476 --> 05:29.104
- Maybe Christmas?
- Not really a Christmas story.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.007
Tell you what.

05:34.183 --> 05:36.083
One says "walk."

05:36.252 --> 05:38.914
And the other says "talk."

05:39.355 --> 05:41.516
Pick one. You choose.

05:41.691 --> 05:44.990
Pick the one that says "walk"
and you'll be free of me.

05:45.161 --> 05:48.528
Pick the one that says "talk"
and, well...

05:50.566 --> 05:51.794
You're kidding, right?

05:53.369 --> 05:54.461
No.

06:06.349 --> 06:07.873
ED

06:09.085 --> 06:12.452
I get the feeling sometimes, Mr. Allen,
that you don't like me very much.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.556
I like Jake Lee.

06:15.191 --> 06:17.625
But my daughter loves you.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.785
Which means you have
a great capacity to hurt her.

06:19.962 --> 06:22.954
And you've never done a damn thing
to prove to me that you won't.

06:23.132 --> 06:26.465
Like I said, my marriage...

06:26.969 --> 06:29.460
...has been one of extremes.

06:29.639 --> 06:33.302
Certainty and doubt. Deceit and truth.

06:33.976 --> 06:36.240
But it started with truth.

06:36.979 --> 06:40.039
And it started right here in this hotel.

06:40.216 --> 06:42.650
In this very room.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.190
- Hey!
- Hey.

06:59.368 --> 07:00.835
- How you doing, man?
- Good.

07:01.003 --> 07:03.028
- Resolutions, huh?
- Yeah.

07:03.206 --> 07:04.867
I always make mine on December 29th.

07:05.041 --> 07:08.442
That way I only have 48 hours
to feel bummed about not keeping them.

07:08.611 --> 07:10.704
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

07:12.348 --> 07:13.474
Hey, have you seen Susan yet?

07:13.649 --> 07:16.209
Uh, no, she's always late.
Have you seen her lately?

07:16.385 --> 07:18.717
No, not since Teddy's party last week.

07:18.888 --> 07:20.355
Teddy had a party?

07:20.523 --> 07:22.013
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:22.191 --> 07:25.285
- Was she there with anyone, or, uh?
- No, not really.

07:25.461 --> 07:28.555
Oh. Which is it? "Not" or, uh, "really"?

07:28.731 --> 07:30.722
It's hard to say.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.372
Careful, Frank,
she'll leave nothing but your bones.

08:08.271 --> 08:09.465
Cheers.
- Cheers.

08:09.639 --> 08:11.766
- Amen.
- Amen.

08:11.941 --> 08:15.104
All right, okay.
Resolutions, who's got one?

08:15.278 --> 08:18.247
- Sherri?
- Thank you. Take off five pounds.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.143
- Oh, come on.
- Take it off now.

08:20.316 --> 08:24.082
Your turn, Frank.
- Okay. I, uh...

08:24.353 --> 08:28.084
I resolve to be bolder.

08:29.992 --> 08:32.460
What a dick. God.

08:32.628 --> 08:35.859
Well, I resolve to fall in love.

08:36.032 --> 08:38.761
Okay.
This is getting a little kinky now, kids.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.802
- That's pretty ambitious.
- I am almost holding your hand.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.378
Okay, next, next. Who, who?

08:50.546 --> 08:52.446
- Come on, Susan.
- Okay, okay. Uh, um...

08:52.615 --> 08:57.746
I resolve to buy a motorcycle.
A red Harley.

08:57.920 --> 09:01.321
Nice. Nothing nicer or sexier
than a chick on a hog.

09:01.490 --> 09:03.481
I resolve to stop you from doing that.

09:03.659 --> 09:05.718
Why? Don't you like motorcycles
or something?

09:05.895 --> 09:09.228
It's just that 95 percent of riders
get injured in the first six months.

09:09.398 --> 09:11.127
- Here we go.
- You memorized the stats?

09:11.300 --> 09:13.461
And 55 percent of riders
get seriously injured.

09:13.636 --> 09:14.967
But it gets better than that.

09:15.137 --> 09:18.004
Do you know what doctors call riders
that don't wear a helmet?

09:18.174 --> 09:19.300
- No, tell us.
- Sexy.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.340
Organ donors.

09:21.510 --> 09:22.977
Organ donors. Yeah.

09:23.145 --> 09:25.705
Just, look, promise me
that you'll always wear a helmet.

09:25.881 --> 09:29.612
Somebody take the pole out of his ass.
Frank, come on, you gotta loosen up, man.

09:29.785 --> 09:32.515
- You take the pole.
- Okay, so I have another resolution.

09:32.688 --> 09:35.122
- An even better one, I think.
- It better be better.

09:35.291 --> 09:37.020
- Does anyone wanna hear it?
- Come on.

09:37.193 --> 09:41.630
Okay. So, um, I resolve to...

09:41.797 --> 09:42.821
...find a husband.

09:43.032 --> 09:45.899
What?
- Yeah. I'm afraid so. It's true.

09:46.068 --> 09:51.734
And, um, uh, I've decided
to pick from my friends.

09:51.907 --> 09:56.276
You know, I don't wanna marry
a stranger or anything. So, um...

09:56.979 --> 09:59.470
- Who wants to be my husband?
- I do.

09:59.649 --> 10:00.809
- I'll do it.
- Me, me, me.

10:00.983 --> 10:04.544
Shit. Oh, God. How will I ever choose?

10:04.720 --> 10:07.712
- By size. By size, boys.
- By size of what, exactly?

10:07.890 --> 10:10.916
Whatever pleases you the most.
- I don't like guesswork, Buddy.

10:11.093 --> 10:14.688
- There won't be any guesswork involved.
- You just keep Mr. Ed in your pants.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.458
Oh, my God. That's actually
what you call it. Mr. Ed?

10:17.633 --> 10:20.101
- That's charming.
- Wait, that's it. That's perfect.

10:20.269 --> 10:23.727
What could be more revealing about a man?
Best nickname for your dick...

10:25.141 --> 10:26.870
...becomes my husband.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.068
Right. Okay, so who's first? Come on.

10:29.245 --> 10:31.611
Ken, what do you got for me?

10:31.781 --> 10:33.248
Come on, baby.

10:33.416 --> 10:36.010
Is it too hard of a question
for you or something?

10:36.185 --> 10:38.449
- Uh, okay.
- What's her name?

10:38.621 --> 10:41.215
I call him...

10:41.390 --> 10:44.052
...Squeaky the Bald-Headed Mouse.

10:44.226 --> 10:46.660
- Oh, my God, you don't.
- Because he likes holes.

10:46.829 --> 10:49.627
- Are you serious?
- There's an animal theme going on here.

10:49.799 --> 10:52.063
- Buddy? Come on.
- You already know, come on.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.963
What?

10:54.370 --> 10:56.770
It's Master of the Universe,
Defender of our Galaxy.

10:56.939 --> 10:58.930
Oh, shit, man.

10:59.108 --> 11:01.076
Couldn't it be "God Almighty"
or something?

11:01.243 --> 11:04.644
- Uh, well, that's my tongue, actually.
- Oh, God. Whatever.

11:04.814 --> 11:07.681
- Okay, Frank?
- Truth.

11:07.850 --> 11:10.148
- Yeah, come on, spit it out.
- The truth.

11:10.319 --> 11:13.083
That's... That's what I call it.

11:13.255 --> 11:14.950
Truth.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.951
I'm sorry it's not a farm animal.
I'm sorry.

11:19.128 --> 11:21.323
- You should be.
- Ten, nine...

11:21.497 --> 11:24.898
...eight, seven, six, five...

11:25.067 --> 11:28.594
...four, three, two, one.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.103
Happy New Year!

11:31.273 --> 11:33.639
It was always gonna be you.

12:02.471 --> 12:04.029
Uhh...
- Daddy.

12:04.206 --> 12:06.401
What is that?
- It's your daughter.

12:06.575 --> 12:08.236
No.

12:08.911 --> 12:11.505
I don't have a daughter this early.

12:11.680 --> 12:14.274
- Whatever's there, kill it.
- Hurry.

12:14.450 --> 12:16.543
- It's wide awake.
- We're gonna miss the sun.

12:16.719 --> 12:19.119
Okay, okay, okay. I'm going, I'm going.

12:19.288 --> 12:20.915
Go away.

12:21.090 --> 12:23.320
Hurry, Daddy.
- Let's let Mommy sleep.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.719
- Hurry.
- Okay.

12:26.896 --> 12:28.830
Come on.

12:32.435 --> 12:35.268
Okay, okay, okay.

12:40.075 --> 12:41.599
Ready?

12:50.085 --> 12:51.609
To give a good speech.

12:51.787 --> 12:53.379
Your turn.

13:01.597 --> 13:02.723
Nice writing.

13:02.898 --> 13:08.029
I wish, I wish, upon the sun,
that my wish is number one.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.466
And what did you wish for?

13:09.638 --> 13:12.573
That Mary Ross will get hit by a truck.

13:12.741 --> 13:16.768
Well, that's not very nice.
I thought Mary was your best friend.

13:17.146 --> 13:20.138
- I divorced her.
- You can't divorce a friend.

13:20.316 --> 13:24.116
- Why not?
- Because divorce is for married people.

13:24.286 --> 13:27.585
That's okay. As long as a truck hits her.

13:29.959 --> 13:31.586
All right, killer, come on.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.785
- Let's go dogpile Mommy.
- Yay.

13:33.963 --> 13:37.660
Shoot. Hey, Monster,
have you seen my morning list?

13:41.770 --> 13:44.068
You need a list to keep track of your lists.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.231
Oh, thank you.

13:46.408 --> 13:48.501
No, honey, that's all sugar
and food coloring.

13:48.677 --> 13:51.145
You've had enough. Go get dressed.

13:51.313 --> 13:54.407
"Conscious". Is it "sc" or "cs"?
Stop right there.

13:55.484 --> 13:58.248
Come and give me a kiss, please.
I got a big lecture today.

13:58.420 --> 14:01.480
- I'll be home in the morning. I love you.
- I love you, too, Dad.

14:01.657 --> 14:03.022
All right.

14:04.226 --> 14:06.126
Don't forget to return the movies.

14:06.829 --> 14:08.524
- Movies?
- Mm-hm.

14:08.697 --> 14:11.962
No, no, no. I can't.

14:12.635 --> 14:15.001
Would you, um, do it if it was on that list?

14:16.105 --> 14:18.005
- Of course I would.
- Give me your pen.

14:18.173 --> 14:20.835
- Ah, ah. No, I don't have time.
- It's on your way.

14:21.010 --> 14:24.673
- I can't be late for the ferry, so...
- What time do you have to leave the house?

14:24.847 --> 14:27.816
- Eighteen after.
- Eighteen after is not a time.

14:27.983 --> 14:33.717
- It's a symptom. It's like a twitch.
- Well, you used to find it adorable.

14:34.123 --> 14:37.889
Yeah, well, I used to pound Jägermeister.

14:39.428 --> 14:41.225
Anyway, you won't be late.

14:41.397 --> 14:43.456
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.

14:48.037 --> 14:49.061
- You didn't.
- I did.

14:49.238 --> 14:52.833
- Oh, shit.
- What? I've given you an extra ten minutes.

14:53.008 --> 14:57.035
No, you didn't. You set it the wrong way.
You've given me ten minutes less.

14:57.212 --> 14:58.873
Oh, shit.

14:59.048 --> 15:00.948
- I'm sure you'll be fine.
- Yeah.

15:01.116 --> 15:02.481
Bye.

15:02.885 --> 15:04.785
You forgot the movies.

15:13.596 --> 15:15.655
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Buddy. Is Frank there?

15:15.831 --> 15:18.095
<i>- He just left.
- I might be late.</i>

15:18.267 --> 15:21.566
<i>- So might he.
- Frank? I don't think that's possible.</i>

15:21.737 --> 15:24.297
Don't drag him into anything
unsavory tonight.

15:24.473 --> 15:26.304
What do you consider unsavory?

15:26.475 --> 15:29.103
<i>Anything that might lead to a rash.</i>

15:29.278 --> 15:30.973
- What are you wearing?
- Buddy.

15:31.146 --> 15:34.707
<i>- Come on.
- I'm naked, Buddy.</i>

15:36.151 --> 15:37.846
Thank you.

15:40.456 --> 15:42.151
We're okay.

15:42.324 --> 15:44.451
We're okay. No, no, no.

15:44.627 --> 15:47.391
Come on. No, no, no, you're kidding me.

15:51.100 --> 15:55.400
Please, please, please. No, no.
Check the time. I'm right here, please.

15:55.571 --> 15:58.734
Hey, congratulations.
You'll be the first one on the next boat.

15:58.907 --> 16:02.104
God, come on. Look, sir, please,
I'm begging you right now.

16:02.277 --> 16:05.075
There's plenty of room on the ferry.
Just let me drive it on.

16:05.247 --> 16:09.877
Please. I beg you, I have a speech.
My wife, the movies... Aargh!

16:10.052 --> 16:12.953
Next boat leaves in an hour.
This boat leaves at eight o'clock.

16:13.122 --> 16:16.091
Oh, look at that, it's eight o'clock.

16:16.925 --> 16:19.519
Next boat, pal.
Schedule to keep, you know.

16:26.969 --> 16:29.028
<i>The relationship between time and you...</i>

16:29.204 --> 16:32.105
<i>... is always one of master and slave.
Ahem.</i>

16:35.210 --> 16:37.178
List-making.

16:37.346 --> 16:41.180
It is your anchor,
your harbor in the storm of life.

16:41.350 --> 16:43.580
Start each morning
with your wish for the day.

16:43.752 --> 16:46.186
And then move right on
into your daily goal list.

16:46.355 --> 16:49.791
And remember to keep them
in behavioral terms, and to be specific.

16:49.958 --> 16:52.859
Why? Because a specific list...

16:54.897 --> 16:56.125
...is a happy list.

16:58.634 --> 17:01.000
And don't forget, it's chaos out there.

17:01.270 --> 17:04.830
And we conquer that by taking control,
setting priorities.

17:05.007 --> 17:06.634
Life cannot be based on whim.

17:07.076 --> 17:09.510
Those who fail to control whim...

17:09.678 --> 17:13.136
...are destined to be controlled by it.

17:13.315 --> 17:14.976
Thank you.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.721
Hey, back in the city.

17:27.896 --> 17:29.363
- Good to see you, man.
- Yeah.

17:29.531 --> 17:32.295
Excellent talk, by the way.
That was truly inspirational.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.265
I saw you come in.

17:34.970 --> 17:37.234
Yeah. My old man
wasn't through busting my ass...

17:37.406 --> 17:39.237
...for being late on the Bethnal job.

17:39.408 --> 17:42.468
Do you have any idea how many
windows are in a building that size?

17:42.644 --> 17:44.908
I don't know. Fifty?

17:46.115 --> 17:47.912
Something wrong in Camp Frank?

17:48.083 --> 17:49.311
No. Ahem.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.749
- What?
- It's a little complicated, that's all.

17:51.920 --> 17:55.720
That's all right. No, that's okay.
I like knowing your life isn't totally perfect.

17:55.891 --> 17:58.018
- Okay, look. You know this talk today?
- Yeah.

17:58.193 --> 18:00.855
It's a big break for me
in the corporate lecture circuit.

18:01.029 --> 18:04.692
Susan. Susan. She knows
how important this is to me.

18:04.867 --> 18:07.062
She knows how nervous I get
before a talk...

18:07.236 --> 18:09.727
...yet she doesn't say anything,
not a word, you know.

18:09.905 --> 18:12.430
Instead, she gets all over me
about my schedule.

18:12.608 --> 18:14.940
She sets the clocks forward
to give me more time...

18:15.110 --> 18:17.977
...only she gives me less time
and I end up missing the ferry.

18:18.147 --> 18:20.877
Now, do you have any idea
how embarrassing it is...

18:21.049 --> 18:24.541
...to show up late to a lecture
on the efficient use of time?

18:24.720 --> 18:27.450
- She actually set the clock forward?
- Actually set the clock forward.

18:27.623 --> 18:31.616
- Ha, ha. Oh, man, that's good.
- Yeah, it's very funny.

18:31.794 --> 18:34.285
Come on, man. She's just trying
to unwind you a bit.

18:34.463 --> 18:38.297
I'm not a clock. I'm not wound.
Stop saying that.

18:38.467 --> 18:41.800
Look, not everything in your life
needs to be ordered, Frank.

18:41.970 --> 18:45.098
You know, if you don't take any chances,
you never try anything new.

18:45.274 --> 18:48.107
That's not true.
Yeah, I take plenty of chances.

18:48.277 --> 18:52.043
Great. Let's ask those chicks if they want
to go play some blackjack with us.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.045
- That's not taking a chance.
- Why not?

18:54.216 --> 18:55.410
- Because.
- Because?

18:56.351 --> 18:58.615
Because everybody knows...

18:58.787 --> 19:01.881
...that the house advantage for blackjack
is 5.9 percent.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.685
And that doesn't make sense.

19:05.928 --> 19:07.896
- Five point nine percent, huh?
- Yeah.

19:08.063 --> 19:11.260
- I thought we were hanging out.
- Yeah, we just did, and it was fun.

19:11.433 --> 19:15.028
But if you're not gonna take a chance,
then there's two of them and one of me.

19:15.204 --> 19:17.138
I like those odds.

19:17.573 --> 19:21.100
Hi, ladies.
That's my friend Frank over there.

20:00.048 --> 20:04.007
I was at your lecture today. It's not bad.

20:04.186 --> 20:05.585
Thank you. Ha.

20:05.754 --> 20:08.882
<i>My boss forced me to read your book,
The Ten Minute...</i>

20:09.057 --> 20:10.888
- It's five.
- What?

20:11.059 --> 20:13.994
<i>- The Five Minute Efficiency Trainer.
- Oh, right. Five.</i>

20:14.162 --> 20:17.723
- It worked. It totally worked.
- Really?

20:17.900 --> 20:21.700
I didn't expect that.
Usually my boss is an idiot. So...

20:21.870 --> 20:24.668
- It was amazing. I mean, I make lists.
- That's great.

20:24.840 --> 20:29.300
- They're color-coded. It's...
- Yeah. It gets the life on track.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.912
- Am I gushing?
- I have no idea.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.548
I'm Paula. Paula Crowe.

20:34.716 --> 20:38.311
- I'm Frank. Frank Allen. Nice to meet you.
- You too.

20:39.488 --> 20:45.085
Would you like to try something
a little bit different, Mr. Frank Allen?

20:45.260 --> 20:46.818
Well, uh...

20:48.463 --> 20:52.991
You know, uh, yeah. Yes, I would actually.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.328
- Yeah?
- Yep.

20:57.906 --> 21:00.773
Two Tangerinis, please.

21:03.712 --> 21:08.149
You know, you're very brave to be able
to talk in front of so many people.

21:08.317 --> 21:11.445
Mm. No. I, uh...

21:11.620 --> 21:14.646
Every night before I give a talk,
I get this nightmare...

21:14.823 --> 21:19.658
...that I'm giving a huge lecture
and suddenly I notice that I'm naked.

21:19.828 --> 21:22.058
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Ooh.

21:22.230 --> 21:26.667
Anyway. When I'm actually
giving the talk for real, I reverse it.

21:26.835 --> 21:30.828
I pretend that everyone in the audience
is naked. That helps me breathe a little.

21:31.006 --> 21:32.974
After today's crowd,
I may reconsider that.

21:40.782 --> 21:41.976
- Frank?
- Mm?

21:42.150 --> 21:45.586
- Can I ask you a big favor?
- Mm.

21:45.754 --> 21:48.917
I, uh, really, really have to go tinkle.

21:49.091 --> 21:53.653
And I have this phobia
about public restrooms.

21:53.829 --> 21:56.662
- Would you...?
- I have the same phobia.

21:56.832 --> 21:59.096
- All my life. All my life.
- Ha-ha-ha. Right?

21:59.267 --> 22:03.704
Would you mind terribly
if I use the bathroom in your room?

22:06.208 --> 22:07.641
You're funny.

22:07.809 --> 22:09.606
Mm, mm, mm.

22:17.152 --> 22:18.983
- Oops.
- Check, please.

22:28.830 --> 22:30.593
Frank?
- Yo.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.963
You know when you said that you
imagined everyone in the audience naked?

22:34.136 --> 22:36.331
Oh, what's this?

22:36.505 --> 22:40.498
Does that mean
that you imagined me naked?

22:41.276 --> 22:45.576
Yeah, married.
Uh, going on eight years now. Yeah.

22:45.747 --> 22:47.146
How did I look?

22:47.315 --> 22:50.478
Uh, just one. Jesse, she's, uh, great.

22:50.652 --> 22:55.487
We're talking about another one
though, so... Whoo.

22:57.359 --> 22:59.122
- This good?
- Hoo.

22:59.294 --> 23:01.956
Uh, wow. I'm gonna
have some juice or something.

23:02.130 --> 23:05.497
I made my daily goal list for today.

23:05.667 --> 23:09.159
- It's very specific.
- Yeah. Well, specific...

23:09.337 --> 23:12.170
Because it's chaos out there
and you conquer it...

23:12.340 --> 23:15.537
...by setting priorities and taking control.

23:15.710 --> 23:18.838
Well, these aren't
instant gratification priorities...

23:19.047 --> 23:21.572
Yeah. We, uh... There's a system to it.

23:23.218 --> 23:26.984
Oh, I'm gonna get that.
Yep, yep, yep. Let me get that.

23:27.155 --> 23:29.521
<i>- Hello?
- Hey.</i>

23:29.691 --> 23:31.158
Hey.

23:31.326 --> 23:34.090
<i>I'm sorry about this morning.
How did the talk go?</i>

23:34.262 --> 23:37.163
Oh, uh, score one for the good guys.
I aced it.

23:39.568 --> 23:40.660
What was that?

23:43.071 --> 23:48.065
Uh, nothing.
I think, uh, I have no idea. So...

23:48.343 --> 23:50.208
<i>- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, baby.</i>

23:50.378 --> 23:53.040
<i>I'm just so exhausted right now...</i>

23:53.215 --> 23:56.275
...and I love you, and I'm gonna
see you tomorrow, okay? All right?

23:56.451 --> 24:00.012
- Okay, okay.
- Love you too.

24:02.124 --> 24:05.093
You should've seen your face.

24:05.260 --> 24:09.959
The way you squirmed,
like a squashed little snake.

24:10.132 --> 24:11.929
- I love married men.
- Oh, my God.

24:12.100 --> 24:15.228
Come here. How about
the five more minutes of efficiency?

24:15.403 --> 24:19.066
I don't feel well. I have a wife and a kid.
I gotta go home.

24:19.241 --> 24:23.678
Relax. It's too late to go anywhere.
You missed the last ferry.

24:23.845 --> 24:30.648
- I'll drive around the peninsula, it's fine.
- Well, that would take forever.

24:30.819 --> 24:32.719
- A waste of time.
- Yeah.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.652
Remember that the relationship
between time and you...

24:35.824 --> 24:40.261
...is always one of master and slave.
- Watch it, watch it, watch it.

24:40.428 --> 24:42.988
Look, I'm really, really sorry
about this, okay?

24:43.165 --> 24:46.362
Use the room as long as you want.
Nothing personal. Honest.

24:46.535 --> 24:48.435
I love my wife.

24:51.540 --> 24:52.632
Jerk.

25:01.216 --> 25:02.240
Hello?

25:03.485 --> 25:05.680
<i>- Hello?
- Hello?</i>

25:06.621 --> 25:08.987
You're probably looking for Frank.

25:09.157 --> 25:12.854
He just left on a mission
of great secrecy. Sorry.

25:40.555 --> 25:42.853
Pick a lane. God.

25:43.024 --> 25:44.787
Oh!

25:56.137 --> 25:58.401
- Oh, God.
- Aargh!

25:58.573 --> 26:01.337
Are you okay? Are you okay?
- Aah!

26:01.509 --> 26:04.842
Can you unlock the door? Can you...?

26:05.013 --> 26:07.538
Okay, what's wrong? Is it your head?
You hit your head?

26:07.716 --> 26:10.082
What's wrong with your stomach?
There's something...

26:10.252 --> 26:11.514
You're having a baby!

26:13.021 --> 26:15.080
Fifteen minutes. We're gonna be there.

26:15.257 --> 26:18.249
We're gonna be at the hospital
in 15 minutes! Just hang in there.

26:18.426 --> 26:21.418
- I'm Frank Allen. What's your name?
- Nancy.

26:21.596 --> 26:24.656
Nancy. Okay, Nancy. You're doing great.
Just keep breathing, okay?

26:24.833 --> 26:28.166
Breathe in, out, in, just think about
how happy this child's gonna make you.

26:28.336 --> 26:30.770
I don't... I don't want it.

26:30.939 --> 26:33.635
Well, my thought is
that you're gonna have it.

26:33.808 --> 26:36.606
- So you know, just in, out.
- You know what?

26:36.778 --> 26:39.110
- Breathe in.
- I want you to have it. You take it.

26:39.281 --> 26:41.806
That's very generous of you,
but no, thank you.

26:41.983 --> 26:45.851
No, thank you... Okay, just hold it.
Hold it!

26:46.354 --> 26:49.289
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Just, come on, we're almost there.

26:49.457 --> 26:52.984
Oh, God! That's it, just keep breathing.
Just...

26:53.161 --> 26:56.961
Oh, it's just leaking everywhere.
Okay. Just breathe.

27:00.635 --> 27:03.695
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm gonna need some information.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.636
- Information on you and your wife.
- No, she's not my wife.

27:06.808 --> 27:11.438
- Well, fill out what you can.
- Okay. Lightheaded here.

27:22.791 --> 27:24.383
<i>- Hello?
- Good day.</i>

27:24.559 --> 27:27.892
<i>- May I speak with Mr. Allen, please?
- No, Mr. Allen isn't home.</i>

27:28.063 --> 27:30.623
Do you know where he is?
It's very important.

27:30.799 --> 27:32.266
No, I don't.

27:32.434 --> 27:36.894
It seems that Mrs. Allen
is no longer on the hospital premises.

27:37.072 --> 27:38.835
I'm Mrs. Allen.

27:39.007 --> 27:43.467
Mrs. Allen. You're in no condition
to have left the hospital.

27:43.645 --> 27:46.273
<i>Post-childbirth
can be a very serious condition.</i>

27:46.448 --> 27:47.642
Post what?

27:47.816 --> 27:51.217
- Your baby needs you.
- What baby?

27:51.386 --> 27:53.786
<i>Do I have the right Allen?</i>

27:54.723 --> 27:56.953
I'm... I'm sorry. Who are you looking for?

27:57.125 --> 28:00.583
<i>Frank Allen of 17 River Drive.</i>

28:03.998 --> 28:05.659
<i>Hello?</i>

28:05.867 --> 28:08.836
Mrs. Allen? Hello?

28:20.014 --> 28:21.709
- Get out.
- What?

28:22.117 --> 28:23.982
- I said, get out.
- Why? What'd I do?

28:24.152 --> 28:29.112
- No, don't give me that. See, I know.
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

28:29.290 --> 28:30.382
- You're a liar.
- Okay...

28:30.558 --> 28:33.652
- You're a liar!
- Aah! Ooh!

28:33.828 --> 28:37.628
God! Okay, okay, listen, listen, listen,
I made a small mistake.

28:37.799 --> 28:39.960
- Oh, God!
- Wait! Susan!

28:40.135 --> 28:43.263
I didn't do anything really wrong!
It was a professional flirtation!

28:43.438 --> 28:47.033
Is this what you've been getting up to
all these dumb business trips of yours?

28:47.208 --> 28:50.336
She was a nobody!
Yelling! Yelling! Yelling!

28:50.512 --> 28:52.241
Okay!
- Oh, God!

28:52.414 --> 28:55.406
All right, there was a small
chaste-like kiss, more of a peck.

28:55.583 --> 28:59.349
- I've been up the whole night.
- There was some tongue, not my tongue.

28:59.521 --> 29:02.422
- You've been boning some woman?
- You called, and it was over.

29:02.590 --> 29:06.390
- Nothing happened!
- How can you call a baby nothing?

29:06.561 --> 29:09.394
- What baby?
- The baby at the hospital!

29:09.564 --> 29:12.624
- Oh, that baby.
- Get out of my house!

29:12.801 --> 29:16.669
- Fuck off!
- I deny everything, Susan! Susan? l...

29:19.207 --> 29:22.267
This is absurd. You're a hospital.
How could you treat somebody...

29:22.444 --> 29:23.706
...and not know who she is?

29:23.878 --> 29:28.508
We occasionally treat the patient before
obtaining their social security number.

29:28.683 --> 29:33.313
- And then you let them escape.
- Mr. Allen, this is a hospital, not a prison.

29:33.488 --> 29:36.753
We don't expect mothers
to desert their babies.

29:43.431 --> 29:48.630
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry.
You're absolutely right.

29:48.803 --> 29:51.499
Can you call my wife?
Explain the misunderstanding...

29:51.673 --> 29:52.833
...and I'll be on my way.

29:53.007 --> 29:55.475
- And tell her what?
- Well, that the baby's not mine.

29:55.643 --> 29:58.976
- That I only met the mother last night.
- I don't know that, Mr. Allen.

29:59.247 --> 30:02.239
Well, it's true.
I drove them here, and that's it.

30:02.750 --> 30:04.308
Save it for your wife.

30:06.521 --> 30:08.785
Here's what Susan dropped off for you.

30:08.957 --> 30:11.755
Uh, what do you think I should do?

30:13.127 --> 30:16.119
Well, are you asking me as your friend
or your lawyer?

30:16.297 --> 30:17.958
Friend.

30:18.132 --> 30:21.898
- Talk. Just talk to her. Be honest.
- I've tried. I'm trying.

30:22.070 --> 30:26.336
She won't talk to me until I prove
it's not my child. This is ridiculous.

30:27.041 --> 30:28.565
You don't remember the last name?

30:28.743 --> 30:30.370
- No.
- No make on the car?

30:30.545 --> 30:31.637
No, it was dark.

30:31.813 --> 30:35.146
As your lawyer, if there's anything
you wanna tell me...

30:35.316 --> 30:38.342
...you know I'm sworn
to hold it private and confidential.

30:42.323 --> 30:45.019
I didn't know her, Damon!

30:45.193 --> 30:48.924
Well. Without the mother's consent
you're gonna have to get a court order...

30:49.097 --> 30:51.327
...for a DNA sample from the baby
for a test.

30:51.499 --> 30:53.433
- How long?
- Four months minimum.

30:53.601 --> 30:55.762
Oh, God.

30:57.305 --> 30:59.330
Look, stop worrying.

30:59.507 --> 31:03.307
If what you say is true, there's no way
the mother, the hospital or the queen...

31:03.478 --> 31:05.878
...could prove that child's yours
in a court of law.

31:06.047 --> 31:09.676
I'm not worried about a court of law.
I'm worried about the court of Susan.

31:09.851 --> 31:13.184
Susan, I demand that you listen to me.
I refuse to be hung...

31:36.311 --> 31:37.744
<i>Honey, I'm begging you.</i>

31:37.912 --> 31:38.936
l...

31:55.763 --> 31:57.355
Monster, I love you. l...

31:57.532 --> 31:59.830
<i>I love you too, Frank.
- Ken?</i>

32:00.101 --> 32:02.160
<i>What are you doing over there?
Where's Susan?</i>

32:02.337 --> 32:03.895
She doesn't want to talk to you.

32:04.072 --> 32:06.267
<i>- Put her on.
- Frank, she went to the hospital.</i>

32:06.441 --> 32:08.409
You're on the form as the father.

32:08.576 --> 32:11.374
<i>- That's not true. Ahem.
- Whatever you say.</i>

32:11.546 --> 32:12.638
I believe you.

32:12.814 --> 32:15.874
You just need to give Susan
a little more time for your sake, okay?

32:17.185 --> 32:18.743
All right.

32:18.920 --> 32:21.047
<i>Hang in there, Frank.</i>

32:21.522 --> 32:23.080
Yeah.

32:41.009 --> 32:44.945
You should be aware that results
are rarely couched in yes-no responses.

32:45.113 --> 32:47.775
It just doesn't have the exactitude
of DNA testing.

32:47.949 --> 32:52.181
The best is usually a statistical probability
with a significant margin of error.

32:52.353 --> 32:53.843
When can I expect results?

32:54.022 --> 32:56.582
Uh, four or five days.

32:56.758 --> 32:59.454
Now, for the fun part.

33:14.976 --> 33:18.173
- Bye, sweetie. See you later.
- Bye.

33:18.346 --> 33:20.041
Uh, what's he doing here?

33:20.214 --> 33:21.545
Picking Jesse up.

33:21.716 --> 33:24.241
You're letting him see Jesse?

33:24.419 --> 33:26.546
He's still her father.

33:27.822 --> 33:30.188
Oh. Look at that.

33:30.358 --> 33:33.350
Big kiss, please. Okay. Ah.

33:34.362 --> 33:35.954
Daddy, when are you coming home?

33:36.130 --> 33:37.995
Hopefully in a few days, sweetie.

33:38.166 --> 33:40.634
How's Mommy? Did she get
any of the messages I left?

33:40.802 --> 33:43.100
She called you a moral slob.

33:43.271 --> 33:44.863
Well, you know Mommy.

33:45.039 --> 33:49.669
Sometimes she gets upset
for no good reason at all.

33:49.844 --> 33:53.007
- Like cleaning my room?
- Exactly.

33:53.181 --> 33:55.479
She gets awfully mad
when I don't clean my room.

33:55.650 --> 33:57.550
It's just like cleaning your room.

33:57.719 --> 33:59.584
So we're both slobs.

33:59.754 --> 34:02.587
I guess so. Yeah.

34:04.258 --> 34:07.250
- Does that make me a bigamist too?
- Oh.

34:08.161 --> 34:10.187
Mommy.

34:19.674 --> 34:21.801
What the hell is that?

34:21.976 --> 34:24.945
I'm calling him Abigail.

34:25.112 --> 34:28.708
Unbelievable. He's dressed you
as a princess, and bought you vermin.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.784
He's the best daddy ever!

34:42.630 --> 34:44.097
Please.

34:50.505 --> 34:53.030
As far as your question of paternity goes,
Mr. Allen...

34:53.206 --> 34:56.108
...the tests prove 100 percent,
without a fraction of doubt...

34:56.277 --> 34:58.040
...that it is not your child.

34:58.212 --> 35:02.672
Yes! Proof! Proof.

35:02.850 --> 35:06.752
Yes, well, I checked the results twice.
There's no question about it.

35:06.921 --> 35:09.389
You saved my life here.
I'm just really excited.

35:09.557 --> 35:13.323
I was expecting some kind of completely
ambiguous statistic here...

35:13.494 --> 35:16.327
...so this is, ahh.

35:16.497 --> 35:21.935
Uh, no, it's actually quite simple.
You have an extra X-chromosome.

35:22.737 --> 35:25.399
- No joke?
- Yeah.

35:26.374 --> 35:27.534
What is that?

35:27.708 --> 35:30.973
Well, it's a condition called
Klinefelter's Syndrome.

35:32.046 --> 35:35.243
Don't worry, it's harmless. Most men
don't even know they have it...

35:35.883 --> 35:38.784
...except for one of its manifestations.

35:40.655 --> 35:42.316
In what? What manifestation?

35:43.791 --> 35:45.088
Sterility.

35:46.961 --> 35:50.397
- Excuse me?
- You've been sterile since birth.

35:52.867 --> 35:55.165
I don't understand. Uh...

35:55.336 --> 35:58.328
It is impossible for you to have children.

36:04.445 --> 36:06.572
Uh...

36:13.020 --> 36:18.822
You got the wrong guy, doc, because
I have a little girl at home, and that...

36:19.861 --> 36:21.226
I'm sorry.

36:22.163 --> 36:26.224
Okay, something's wrong here.
I'm gonna sit down and just...

36:26.400 --> 36:28.766
Um, you have the wrong label,
or wrong test.

36:28.936 --> 36:31.996
I mean, this is a hospital.
These things happen here all the time.

36:32.173 --> 36:36.269
l... I'm sorry to drop this on you.
I know this isn't easy to accept.

36:36.444 --> 36:38.105
Hey.

36:38.279 --> 36:44.149
Come on, I'm a father. I have a little girl.
A 7-year-old girl. Jesse.

36:44.318 --> 36:48.550
Unlike humans, chromosomes can't betray,
deceive, or willfully lie.

36:48.723 --> 36:51.123
The truth is all they state.

36:51.926 --> 36:53.518
Um...

37:01.636 --> 37:05.732
But, Jesse. I have a... A little girl.

37:05.907 --> 37:09.570
I will, of course, take another sample,
but I've run the test twice.

37:09.744 --> 37:12.770
I'm afraid, Mr. Allen,
there's been no mistake.

38:44.372 --> 38:46.431
It's all been a lie, hasn't it?

38:46.607 --> 38:48.336
- You tell me.
- I know.

38:48.509 --> 38:50.409
Oh, yeah? Well, I know, too!

38:50.578 --> 38:51.738
Hi, Daddy.

38:53.981 --> 38:58.315
Go to your room, sweetie.
Daddy and I need to talk, okay?

39:27.515 --> 39:28.675
Uh, excuse me?

39:28.849 --> 39:31.909
I'm willing to bet ten bucks
that you're naked under those clothes.

39:32.086 --> 39:33.951
Why don't you join me for a drink?

39:40.394 --> 39:42.624
Hey, buddy?
I think you're sitting in my seat.

39:42.797 --> 39:46.028
I wanna sit next to the pretty girl here,
hmm?

39:47.468 --> 39:50.232
Hey, pinhead, I'm talking to you.
You're in my seat.

39:54.141 --> 39:56.268
You work the ferry?

39:56.444 --> 39:59.743
Yeah, so? Move your ass.

40:00.548 --> 40:03.381
If you'd let me on,
I wouldn't have been late.

40:03.551 --> 40:05.712
I wouldn't have been so mad at Susan.

40:05.886 --> 40:08.116
I wouldn't have been so stupid.

40:09.356 --> 40:12.257
I wouldn't know the things
that I know today.

40:12.426 --> 40:14.621
Do I know you or something?

40:15.996 --> 40:18.055
What time is it now?

40:18.833 --> 40:20.391
What?

40:23.671 --> 40:25.764
What time is it now?

40:25.940 --> 40:27.567
- Screw you.
- What time is it?

40:27.741 --> 40:31.268
You want a piece of me, asshole?
Let's take it outside.

41:22.229 --> 41:24.220
That felt good.

41:24.932 --> 41:27.526
Thank you for doing that.

41:50.991 --> 41:53.516
- What is your name?
- Tracy.

42:17.318 --> 42:21.618
We're gonna be late again. Get your bag,
sweetie. I'll be in the car, okay?

42:27.995 --> 42:30.725
- Can I help you?
- Does Frank live here?

42:31.298 --> 42:33.357
He's not home.

42:34.235 --> 42:35.634
I'm his wife.

42:35.803 --> 42:38.897
Oh. Hi. I'm Nancy.

42:39.073 --> 42:40.700
I wanted to thank him.

42:43.177 --> 42:44.371
For what?

42:45.112 --> 42:47.012
All his help.

42:50.050 --> 42:51.108
Is that Frank's baby?

42:51.919 --> 42:53.716
Oh, no.

42:56.223 --> 43:00.990
Frank, it's me. Why won't you call
me back? We need to talk. Please?

43:01.161 --> 43:02.856
Call me.

43:08.836 --> 43:12.567
Flat out on the floor. Then he
gets so scared he takes off on his Harley...

43:12.740 --> 43:14.935
Shh!
- Uh, ahem.

43:19.380 --> 43:21.348
- What's going on?
- Um...

43:23.450 --> 43:25.042
Um...

43:25.219 --> 43:27.744
Let's, um, talk outside.

43:27.921 --> 43:29.411
Yeah.

43:36.664 --> 43:39.394
There are some rumors about Frank.
Crazy stuff.

43:39.566 --> 43:42.865
Tom has a cousin who said his best friend
was at the River Shore Bar...

43:43.037 --> 43:45.870
...when your husband got into a fight
and shredded this big bruiser.

43:46.040 --> 43:49.271
- Frank?
- Yes. And he bought a bitchen Harley.

43:49.777 --> 43:53.042
No, that's not Frank. That's just
not possible. Somebody's confused.

43:53.213 --> 43:58.344
No. John's son works at the shop.
Frank bought a Harley. A red one.

43:58.752 --> 44:01.346
- A red Harley?
- Yes.

44:05.326 --> 44:07.055
Without me?

44:13.000 --> 44:14.228
Frank?

44:14.401 --> 44:17.234
Oh, I'm sorry.

44:17.404 --> 44:19.338
I'll leave a note.

45:04.952 --> 45:07.716
- I need to talk to you.
- Oh, yeah?

45:07.888 --> 45:11.415
I found this in his hotel room.
I'm worried.

45:11.592 --> 45:12.923
It's very succinct.

45:13.093 --> 45:15.584
I met the mother.
She says it's not Frank's baby.

45:15.763 --> 45:17.924
Well, that's great.
You can take Frank back.

45:18.098 --> 45:20.191
There was still a woman in his hotel room.

45:20.367 --> 45:23.996
Come on, give the boy a break.
I mean, we all have urges.

45:24.171 --> 45:27.004
- You never look at the pool boy?
- We don't own a pool.

45:27.174 --> 45:29.233
You don't need a pool for a pool boy.

45:29.410 --> 45:32.174
It's different.
I never thought of Frank as duplicitous.

45:32.346 --> 45:34.678
- It's not Frank-ish.
- No, it's not.

45:34.848 --> 45:36.543
It's not really his style.

45:36.717 --> 45:40.175
Buddy, stop it. I'm not this wanton
creature you got floating around...

45:40.354 --> 45:43.016
...in your sleazy little brain.
- Really?

45:43.190 --> 45:45.750
I've had three men my whole life, okay?

45:47.094 --> 45:50.586
And this isn't about me, and it's damn sure
not about you. It's about Frank.

45:50.764 --> 45:53.028
Hey, come on.
You know I'll do anything for Frank.

45:53.200 --> 45:57.193
Then find him and make sure
he doesn't do anything dumb.

46:07.247 --> 46:09.977
Hey. It's open.

46:10.250 --> 46:11.740
Hey.

46:11.985 --> 46:14.385
- Hey.
- Are you trying to kill yourself?

46:14.588 --> 46:17.113
Well, obviously,
but I think it's gonna take a little while.

46:17.291 --> 46:20.317
Ha, ha. Good,
because I bring happy news.

46:20.494 --> 46:22.621
Susan will take you back.

46:22.796 --> 46:24.730
A little begging may be required.

46:24.898 --> 46:27.162
What I do is send red roses
every day for a week.

46:27.334 --> 46:31.202
By day five of the big red, she'll forgive
you three hookers and a missed birthday.

46:31.371 --> 46:32.998
I'm not going back.

46:33.173 --> 46:36.506
- I had a pretty major revelation, Buddy.
- What?

46:36.677 --> 46:39.202
All the decisions I've made in my life
have been wrong.

46:40.047 --> 46:43.346
- Everybody feels that way, come on.
- No, it's true.

46:43.517 --> 46:46.850
I've always been so goddamn careful
about every choice that I've made...

46:47.020 --> 46:49.147
...and what the hell has it gotten me?
Nothing.

46:49.323 --> 46:51.848
So, instead I look around here...

46:52.025 --> 46:55.256
...and I write lists of everything
that I really wanna do...

46:55.429 --> 46:58.296
...and then I just randomly pick
between them. It's beautiful.

46:58.465 --> 47:01.696
Frank, did you hear me?
Susan will take you back.

47:01.869 --> 47:03.393
What are you doing?

47:03.570 --> 47:07.768
- There's no choice to be made.
- Exactly. This is what I'm talking about.

47:07.941 --> 47:09.966
Whim. Chance.

47:10.143 --> 47:13.271
I've decided to never decide
another thing again.

47:15.616 --> 47:16.913
Hockey.

47:18.785 --> 47:19.809
And so it is.

47:26.894 --> 47:29.158
Frank, maybe I didn't
make myself perfectly clear.

47:29.329 --> 47:31.024
I really think she'll take you back.

47:31.198 --> 47:34.463
Hey, she loves you, you know?
And you obviously can't live without her.

47:34.635 --> 47:38.036
That's not true.
I'm walking on sunshine out here, man.

47:38.205 --> 47:41.868
When you look at me, you look at
a creature of freedom. A man released.

47:42.042 --> 47:45.409
Any chance this "creature of freedom"
is really a monster of depression?

47:45.579 --> 47:46.671
No.

47:46.847 --> 47:50.146
Look, what you need, and I say this
as your best friend, is a vacation.

47:50.317 --> 47:55.084
A bit of sun, a bit of relaxation,
and a huge chunk of Prozac.

47:55.255 --> 47:57.155
- I like that.
- Yeah?

47:57.324 --> 47:59.622
I like that idea. Watch this.

47:59.793 --> 48:01.351
Okay.

48:01.528 --> 48:03.155
"Prozac."

48:04.097 --> 48:06.998
"Streak ice." Ooh.

48:09.536 --> 48:12.801
- And "become Slayers fan."
- What are you doing?

48:12.973 --> 48:15.373
I'm gonna pick one.
I'm gonna abide by the choice.

48:15.542 --> 48:17.407
- You know what that makes me?
- A flake?

48:17.578 --> 48:18.738
- Free.
- That's bullshit.

48:18.912 --> 48:22.678
You've been a Meteor since you were 6.
You can't change who you are.

48:22.849 --> 48:24.840
- I can.
- You can't.

48:25.018 --> 48:26.485
Okay, then.

48:26.653 --> 48:29.986
To do that, you'd have to be
really twisted, man. Slayers?

48:30.157 --> 48:33.957
That's morally abhorrent. A man
who would do that is capable of anything.

48:34.127 --> 48:36.061
Exactly.

48:40.233 --> 48:44.260
Frank, if you're gonna go nuts, you should
at least have a god or a dog talking to you.

48:44.438 --> 48:47.430
Index cards? It's just not that sexy.

48:48.375 --> 48:51.003
You need help, man.
You need to see a doctor.

48:51.178 --> 48:54.306
- I did.
- You saw a shrink?

48:54.481 --> 48:55.948
No.

48:56.116 --> 48:58.175
No, not a shrink.

48:58.752 --> 49:02.244
If there's something wrong,
you can talk to me, you know?

49:03.690 --> 49:05.749
Jesse's not my genetic daughter.

49:05.926 --> 49:08.087
- What?
- Yeah.

49:08.261 --> 49:09.888
Yeah. I have Klinefelters Syndrome.

49:10.063 --> 49:11.496
- Kline-what?
- Klinefelters.

49:11.665 --> 49:16.295
I was born with an extra X-chromosome.
I've been sterile since birth.

49:16.470 --> 49:19.439
- Are they sure? I mean...
- Yeah. Yeah.

49:19.606 --> 49:22.507
It's impossible for me to be a father.

49:51.038 --> 49:52.665
I saw her.

49:52.839 --> 49:57.503
It was December 19.

49:58.078 --> 50:01.241
Oh, God. Oh, no.

50:13.393 --> 50:15.861
Hey, Jesse.
- Hi, Buddy.

50:16.029 --> 50:17.587
Jesse, how old are you?

50:17.764 --> 50:18.958
- Seven.
- You're seven.

50:19.132 --> 50:21.532
Really? Now when's your birthday?

50:22.002 --> 50:25.165
- Today.
- Today? Today's your birthday?

50:25.338 --> 50:27.602
You didn't get me a present, did you?

50:28.141 --> 50:31.668
Oh, jeez. Of course I did.

50:31.845 --> 50:34.780
I, uh, got you this watch.

50:35.382 --> 50:37.748
And be careful, it's a Rolex.

50:38.485 --> 50:41.113
- Is your mother inside?
- Yeah.

50:51.565 --> 50:54.898
Susan, I found a man wandering aimlessly
in the hallway looking for you.

50:55.068 --> 50:57.593
- Thanks, Peg. Goodbye, Peg.
- And what a man he is.

50:58.538 --> 51:01.837
- Is today really Jesse's birthday?
- No, it's in August.

51:02.008 --> 51:03.942
What about Frank? Is he all right?

51:04.811 --> 51:07.245
- Uh, yeah, Damon bailed him out.
- Damon what?

51:07.414 --> 51:09.314
- Who was the third lover?
- Who?

51:09.483 --> 51:12.008
You said I was one of three lovers.
Frank would be two.

51:12.185 --> 51:14.449
- So there must have been a third. Who?
- What?

51:14.654 --> 51:16.281
- Who was the third man?
- Let me go.

51:16.456 --> 51:18.287
- No, not until you tell me.
- You're crazy.

51:18.458 --> 51:20.483
- I want a name. Who was it?
- Alan Zelf.

51:20.660 --> 51:24.596
- Alan Zelf. When?
- When I worked at that burger joint.

51:24.765 --> 51:27.928
I was 17, we did it in the basement
on top of a pile of buns, okay?

51:28.101 --> 51:30.194
What's gotten into you?

51:30.370 --> 51:31.598
Fatherhood.

51:45.619 --> 51:47.143
Time.

51:47.554 --> 51:49.283
Efficiency.

51:50.223 --> 51:52.453
Organizational skills.

51:55.695 --> 51:58.220
Do any of you really give a shit?

51:58.632 --> 52:01.692
You're here because your boss thinks...

52:01.868 --> 52:05.065
...that if you keep your desk clear
and your calendars streamlined...

52:05.238 --> 52:08.935
...you'll sell a few more computers,
and who knows, maybe he's right.

52:09.376 --> 52:12.243
But will that make you any happier?

52:12.412 --> 52:16.280
Will it prevent you from waking up
one morning with an incurable disease?

52:16.449 --> 52:20.818
Will it stop your wife, Susan,
from whoring around on you?

52:21.254 --> 52:24.087
Must've been that week
before New Year's.

52:24.257 --> 52:26.122
At Teddy's party.

52:26.293 --> 52:30.161
I knew it was stupid. Even when we were
doing it I knew it was stupid.

52:30.330 --> 52:32.662
Gee, thanks.
That makes me feel so much better.

52:32.833 --> 52:34.801
- You could've used birth control.
- I did.

52:34.968 --> 52:37.266
- I guess it wasn't completely effective.
- Yeah, no kidding.

52:37.437 --> 52:39.268
Oh!

52:39.873 --> 52:40.897
I could die.

52:41.074 --> 52:43.770
Betrayed.
Yeah, sure, we've been betrayed.

52:43.944 --> 52:46.572
By the assumptions of our own society.
You stay in line.

52:46.746 --> 52:49.681
Keep your shoes shined. Hard work
and devotion will be rewarded.

52:49.850 --> 52:52.978
Well, let me ask you something,
is anyone here truly happy?

52:54.487 --> 52:55.749
If so...

52:56.056 --> 52:58.217
...raise your happy hand.

52:59.893 --> 53:02.555
Then the decisions that you've made
in your life are crap.

53:02.729 --> 53:04.856
You're a crappy person.
Leading a crappy life.

53:05.031 --> 53:06.464
- Crappy, crappy, crappy.
- No.

53:06.633 --> 53:08.726
Yeah. Crappy.

53:08.902 --> 53:12.201
Poor Frank, suddenly finding out
he's not a father.

53:12.372 --> 53:15.569
Enough poor Frank. What about
poor Buddy, suddenly finding out he is?

53:15.742 --> 53:17.369
- Poor Jesse.
- Poor Jesse?

53:17.544 --> 53:19.569
- No father.
- What am I? Chopped liver?

53:19.746 --> 53:20.838
You're a mistake!

53:21.014 --> 53:23.278
It could have been me you married
eight years ago.

53:23.450 --> 53:25.350
It would've cramped your style.

53:26.119 --> 53:28.212
You don't think I crave stability?

53:28.388 --> 53:31.846
You don't think I haven't wanted a family,
or desired intimacy?

53:33.460 --> 53:35.826
You don't think I've always loved you?

53:37.797 --> 53:38.889
No.

53:42.502 --> 53:44.129
Yes. Yes.
- No. No!

54:09.329 --> 54:11.229
Whim...

54:11.398 --> 54:12.990
...not thought.

54:13.166 --> 54:14.997
Chance...

54:15.168 --> 54:17.033
...not planning.

54:17.203 --> 54:20.331
You are where you are today
because you've been comatose.

54:20.507 --> 54:23.408
You've all lacked passion!

54:26.846 --> 54:28.871
Act on those passions.

54:29.549 --> 54:31.676
Succumb to your whim.

54:31.851 --> 54:37.255
Forge a new being, goddamn it.
Do something before it's too late!

54:42.495 --> 54:44.520
Say yes to whim!

54:44.698 --> 54:49.294
Say yes to chance! Say yes to chaos!

55:42.956 --> 55:45.948
Paula, right?

55:47.694 --> 55:53.189
Frank Allen. Are you still a, uh,
time tamer?

55:53.366 --> 55:56.927
Are you still a home-wrecking bitch?

55:57.103 --> 55:59.128
Still gay?

56:04.677 --> 56:07.111
What's with the cards?

56:45.752 --> 56:47.447
What happened?

56:48.221 --> 56:50.883
What, you don't remember, beasty-boy?

56:51.057 --> 56:52.547
No.

56:52.725 --> 56:54.625
It was terrible.

56:55.462 --> 56:57.225
In a good way?

56:57.397 --> 57:01.163
You passed out halfway in, so to speak.

57:01.334 --> 57:03.598
Why is my pillow wet?

57:03.770 --> 57:07.069
You cried in your sleep
for two-and-a-half hours.

57:07.240 --> 57:10.835
Whimpering like a little girl.

57:12.178 --> 57:15.238
It was like soft hotel-porn...

57:15.682 --> 57:18.708
...unsatisfying and sad.

57:20.053 --> 57:22.783
- See you.
- See you.

57:35.935 --> 57:37.732
Hey, it's me.

57:37.904 --> 57:42.068
I know this is the 33rd message I've left,
but please call me, okay?

57:42.242 --> 57:44.210
I need to talk to you, Frank.

57:44.377 --> 57:46.004
Please.

57:47.113 --> 57:48.137
Bye.

57:55.421 --> 57:56.547
- Hello.
- Hey.

57:56.723 --> 57:57.781
Here you go.

57:57.957 --> 58:00.357
- Thanks.
- Have a good day.

58:52.812 --> 58:53.836
Susan?

58:54.013 --> 58:56.413
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait!

59:08.661 --> 59:11.027
Stop.
- You have to stop following me.

59:11.197 --> 59:13.859
- And stop getting me flowers.
- For chrissake, Susan.

59:14.033 --> 59:16.297
Cut me some slack.
I'm trying to do what's right.

59:16.469 --> 59:19.597
- Okay. I'm trying to do what's not wrong.
- It's already been done.

59:19.772 --> 59:22.263
- But I love you, doesn't that count?
- No.

59:22.442 --> 59:25.172
Don't play the martyr with me.
You're not alone in this.

59:25.345 --> 59:29.304
- I'm just as smashed up as you are.
- Then find your own hole to crawl into.

59:30.316 --> 59:33.285
Well, what about Jesse?
I mean, she's ours.

59:36.522 --> 59:38.717
Jesse has nothing to do with you.

59:38.891 --> 59:40.415
She hates me, doesn't she?

59:40.593 --> 59:43.391
She doesn't know you well enough
to hate you.

59:43.563 --> 59:45.895
So if she knew me, then she'd hate me?

59:48.468 --> 59:50.163
Buddy, what do you want?

59:55.375 --> 59:58.242
My whole life people have been telling me
I'm not responsible.

59:58.811 --> 01:00:00.904
I'm not, you know?
I haven't wanted to be.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.105
But this is different.

01:00:04.183 --> 01:00:06.947
I just desperately wanna do what's right.

01:00:14.294 --> 01:00:16.125
What is right?

01:01:26.733 --> 01:01:28.166
Hi.

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:32.097
Oh, God. I'm so...

01:01:33.039 --> 01:01:34.404
I'm...

01:01:35.742 --> 01:01:36.970
I'm sorry, Frank.

01:01:40.847 --> 01:01:42.474
You know?

01:01:43.216 --> 01:01:44.877
Yeah.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.381
Why didn't you tell me?

01:01:49.722 --> 01:01:52.088
It's hard to talk
with a knife in your back, Susan.

01:01:52.258 --> 01:01:55.284
No, come on, it wasn't like that.

01:01:56.095 --> 01:02:00.532
It had to have happened before New Year's,
after that night it was only you.

01:02:03.603 --> 01:02:07.232
- No double-life?
- No, sweetie, no. Never.

01:02:10.376 --> 01:02:11.968
Do you know whose it is?

01:02:13.045 --> 01:02:17.982
- She's not an "it," she's Jesse.
- Do you know, Susan?

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:23.186
Yes.

01:02:23.356 --> 01:02:25.688
She's yours, Frank. She's...

01:02:26.259 --> 01:02:29.353
Maybe not medically...

01:02:29.529 --> 01:02:33.556
...but in all other ways she's your daughter.
You're her father.

01:02:35.601 --> 01:02:39.059
Whose is she? Whose is she, Susan?

01:02:39.238 --> 01:02:42.264
She's yours. She's yours.

01:02:42.442 --> 01:02:46.378
She's yours. She's yours because...

01:02:46.879 --> 01:02:51.612
Because when she had strep throat
you held her through three nights of fever.

01:02:51.784 --> 01:02:54.753
Yours because her first word was "Dad."

01:02:54.921 --> 01:02:57.890
Because how scared you got
when you thought you lost her...

01:02:58.057 --> 01:03:01.254
...in the mall for 40 seconds.

01:03:01.427 --> 01:03:04.294
Because of how happy you feel
every time you open your eyes...

01:03:04.464 --> 01:03:06.830
...and she's standing there looking at you.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:11.730
She loves you, Frank. You love her.
This is...

01:03:11.904 --> 01:03:15.465
This is our home. It's our family.
Come on, Frank.

01:03:15.641 --> 01:03:17.438
JESSE
Mommy.

01:03:19.679 --> 01:03:21.010
Mommy.

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:23.080
I'm coming.

01:03:28.921 --> 01:03:31.412
I'll be two seconds, okay?

01:03:31.591 --> 01:03:33.388
Yeah.

01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:08.725
- What is it, honey?
- I had a bad dream.

01:04:12.632 --> 01:04:14.896
Go back to sleep, okay?

01:04:16.235 --> 01:04:18.169
Try to go back to sleep.

01:05:01.781 --> 01:05:03.442
Frank?

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:15.550
Shit.

01:06:22.328 --> 01:06:26.560
- Can I help you?
- I'd like a weapon, a gun, preferably.

01:06:26.732 --> 01:06:28.632
I need to shoot something tonight.

01:06:30.569 --> 01:06:33.003
There's a three-day waiting period
on all handguns...

01:06:33.172 --> 01:06:36.073
...but I can sell you a shotgun,
or a rifle, today.

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:37.573
I'll take one.

01:06:37.743 --> 01:06:39.005
Great. What type?

01:06:40.279 --> 01:06:42.645
- Uh...
- What are you using it for?

01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:46.550
- Hunting.
- Hunting.

01:06:46.719 --> 01:06:47.777
What are you hunting?

01:06:47.953 --> 01:06:50.046
- Uh, duck.
- Duck?

01:06:50.222 --> 01:06:53.191
Yes. A huge duck.

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:56.025
Are you using a blind?

01:06:57.563 --> 01:06:59.121
No. Uh...

01:06:59.298 --> 01:07:01.357
No. I'd like to do this face to face.

01:07:03.469 --> 01:07:06.233
This would be a solid choice for you, sir.

01:07:20.619 --> 01:07:22.177
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, it's Damon.</i>

01:07:22.354 --> 01:07:23.378
Oh, hey. What's up?

01:07:23.556 --> 01:07:26.650
Listen, Frank came by and picked up
the key to the boathouse.

01:07:26.826 --> 01:07:29.852
He was, uh, acting really weird.
I almost didn't give it to him.

01:07:30.029 --> 01:07:32.224
He said he found a faster way
than cigarettes...

01:07:32.398 --> 01:07:34.525
<i>... and that maybe you should
meet him up there?</i>

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:36.964
<i>I'm a little worried.
Maybe I should go with you.</i>

01:07:37.136 --> 01:07:39.331
No, I'll take care of it. Thanks, Damon.

01:07:42.942 --> 01:07:44.307
<i>BUDD Y
It's Buddy.</i>

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:47.742
<i>I think Frank might've gone up
to the lake to try something rash.</i>

01:07:47.913 --> 01:07:51.246
<i>I'm just gonna make sure he's all right.
I'll call you when I get there.</i>

01:08:12.805 --> 01:08:14.670
That's amazing.

01:08:15.641 --> 01:08:18.404
I was just gonna call you,
and lo and behold, here you are.

01:08:18.611 --> 01:08:21.078
Well, Damon told me you came up.

01:08:21.613 --> 01:08:24.947
I thought maybe you could use a friend,
you know? Someone to talk to.

01:08:25.117 --> 01:08:27.142
Anything on your mind?

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:31.517
This thin mountain air can give
people strange ideas, you know?

01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:35.917
Ain't that the truth. No, nothing
I can think of off the top of my head.

01:08:36.796 --> 01:08:37.888
How about you?

01:08:38.564 --> 01:08:40.930
- Me?
- Anything you wanna tell me?

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:43.068
Not really, no.

01:08:47.907 --> 01:08:49.203
Let's go for a boat ride.

01:08:57.582 --> 01:09:00.211
So you finished with all those index cards?
Has whim waned?

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.877
Ha, ha. Hell, no.

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:05.921
It was in the cards to come up here
and accomplish something.

01:09:06.091 --> 01:09:08.752
- What sort of something?
- Something big.

01:09:08.928 --> 01:09:12.193
- How big?
- Oh. Biggest thing in my life.

01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:14.127
Is the keyword here "life"?

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:19.603
- Could be. Definitely could be.
- You don't wanna do anything drastic.

01:09:19.805 --> 01:09:21.363
Don't I?

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:24.134
I mean, something you can't take back,
you know? Final.

01:09:24.310 --> 01:09:26.368
Oh, you mean something I'll regret.

01:09:27.513 --> 01:09:31.040
You have to think of those who love you.
I mean, think of your friends.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:34.609
- Why my friends?
- Because your actions affect them.

01:09:35.754 --> 01:09:38.188
Oh, I'll give you that. Yeah.

01:09:38.357 --> 01:09:41.258
One should always think
of one's friends before considering...

01:09:41.627 --> 01:09:43.026
...certain things.

01:09:43.194 --> 01:09:44.685
That's profound of you, Buddy.

01:09:44.863 --> 01:09:48.129
I suppose that "certain things"
would test the limit of our friendship.

01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:49.926
- Wouldn't you think?
- Exactly.

01:09:50.102 --> 01:09:51.796
Exactly.

01:09:52.805 --> 01:09:55.330
- Aren't we getting out a little far?
- Yeah, Buddy.

01:09:55.507 --> 01:09:57.668
We're getting out a little far.

01:10:00.279 --> 01:10:03.373
Frank? Buddy?

01:10:06.285 --> 01:10:08.150
What the hell are we doing here, Frank?

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:11.289
- I think you know.
- I won't let you.

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:14.790
Yeah? Well, why don't you try
and stop me. Go ahead.

01:10:14.994 --> 01:10:17.121
- Where the hell did you get that?
- Who cares?

01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:19.628
- I'm not shooting blanks this time.
- Put it down.

01:10:19.798 --> 01:10:22.665
- We can talk about this, can't we?
- Let's just cut the shit.

01:10:22.835 --> 01:10:26.703
- Don't start whimpering now.
- Whimpering? Hey, it's your decision.

01:10:27.006 --> 01:10:30.669
- Oh, that's generous of you.
- It doesn't mean I agree with it.

01:10:30.976 --> 01:10:33.001
Well, I would hope not!

01:10:33.178 --> 01:10:35.703
Look, you can't do this to me,
or you, I won't let you.

01:10:35.881 --> 01:10:38.850
- You're gonna have to shoot me first.
- There's a hell of an argument.

01:10:39.018 --> 01:10:40.042
Give me that.

01:10:46.025 --> 01:10:47.356
Come on.

01:10:47.559 --> 01:10:49.959
Shooting me first
was just a figure of speech.

01:10:50.129 --> 01:10:52.529
Oh, shit.
Oh, that went all the way through.

01:10:53.065 --> 01:10:56.330
I don't think it's smart to put holes
in things that sink or breathe.

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:59.403
But you're the one with the gun.
I can appreciate that.

01:10:59.571 --> 01:11:02.472
- Are you looking for something?
- A lifejacket.

01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:07.242
Son of a bitch!

01:11:08.781 --> 01:11:10.180
Frank!

01:11:10.649 --> 01:11:14.710
Frank! Frank, what the hell is going on?

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:15.944
Frank!

01:11:17.656 --> 01:11:19.783
They're just dancing, Mommy.

01:11:19.959 --> 01:11:21.688
Give me that.

01:11:24.863 --> 01:11:26.353
We gotta get help, come on.

01:11:31.737 --> 01:11:34.934
There! Go ahead, commit suicide now!

01:11:35.674 --> 01:11:38.905
Suicide?
You think I'm trying to commit suicide?

01:11:39.078 --> 01:11:42.275
- Yeah.
- You impossibly stupid man.

01:11:42.448 --> 01:11:46.976
You philandering, dumba... Murder!

01:11:47.519 --> 01:11:50.716
I'm trying to commit murder! You idiot!

01:11:55.394 --> 01:11:57.419
Yeah, yeah, a boat. Um...

01:11:58.063 --> 01:11:59.826
l... I don't know.

01:11:59.999 --> 01:12:04.129
Yeah, I heard a rifle shot.
You need to get out here, now, okay?

01:12:04.303 --> 01:12:06.828
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

01:12:07.539 --> 01:12:11.703
Sweetie, I need you to stay in the cabin,
okay? Just stay here.

01:13:00.993 --> 01:13:04.087
Yeah, don't worry, you still have
a chance to freeze to death.

01:13:04.263 --> 01:13:06.788
No, I wanna kill you!

01:13:10.569 --> 01:13:14.471
Well, if I knew what you
obviously know, I'd wanna kill me too.

01:13:16.608 --> 01:13:19.873
That's understanding of you.

01:13:23.015 --> 01:13:24.277
I'm sorry.

01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:26.748
Fuck you.

01:13:39.998 --> 01:13:43.024
Mrs. Allen, you best wait inside.

01:13:43.202 --> 01:13:44.567
Have you found them yet?

01:13:44.736 --> 01:13:48.729
When I know something, you'll know
something. Please, wait inside.

01:13:57.015 --> 01:13:59.916
Do you even know
where the hell we're going?

01:14:00.085 --> 01:14:02.053
There's a footbridge up ahead.

01:14:02.221 --> 01:14:04.849
The cabin's a mile from that.

01:14:39.825 --> 01:14:41.918
They're searching for us.

01:14:42.461 --> 01:14:45.794
- How do they know we're here?
- I told Susan.

01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:51.733
Do you love her?

01:14:54.573 --> 01:14:56.473
Does it matter?

01:14:58.343 --> 01:15:00.208
And Jesse?

01:15:04.049 --> 01:15:05.846
She's just a kid.

01:15:06.018 --> 01:15:08.213
What does that mean, Buddy?

01:15:10.255 --> 01:15:12.485
I hardly know her.

01:15:18.730 --> 01:15:20.664
What now?

01:15:25.103 --> 01:15:28.300
I just, I thought if I did everything...

01:15:28.473 --> 01:15:31.271
...for the now,
that I could forget the past...

01:15:31.443 --> 01:15:34.207
...and the past is who I am.

01:15:35.447 --> 01:15:38.507
And I just, I don't... l...

01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:42.944
How am I supposed to go back to Susan
if I don't know how to forgive her?

01:15:46.558 --> 01:15:48.321
Look. Uh, ahem.

01:15:51.363 --> 01:15:55.197
I'm gonna disappear. Just, look,
tell them that you lost me, okay?

01:15:55.601 --> 01:15:58.161
No, Frank. No, I won't.

01:15:58.337 --> 01:16:00.464
- Yeah. You owe me that!
- No.

01:16:00.639 --> 01:16:03.665
Owe you? I don't owe you anything!

01:16:04.776 --> 01:16:08.405
And you know what?
You're a freaking idiot!

01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:14.046
I wish Susan had picked me.

01:16:14.586 --> 01:16:16.315
I wish Susan loved me.

01:16:16.688 --> 01:16:19.657
I wish Jesse thought of me as her father.

01:16:20.225 --> 01:16:22.659
But all they do is love you.

01:16:25.797 --> 01:16:27.958
God, I even love you.

01:16:29.368 --> 01:16:33.270
I'm cold, I'm wet, and I'm past feeling sad
for anyone but myself.

01:16:33.438 --> 01:16:38.102
So you know, stay out here if you want.
Become one with nature, go hump Bigfoot.

01:16:38.277 --> 01:16:41.405
But I'm going back into the cabin
and getting warm.

01:16:43.548 --> 01:16:45.072
God.

01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:30.455
I think we got one over here.

01:17:31.163 --> 01:17:33.154
Somebody get a blanket!

01:17:53.885 --> 01:17:55.216
Where's Mr. Allen?

01:17:58.824 --> 01:18:00.189
It's complicated.

01:19:36.121 --> 01:19:37.611
Daddy!

01:19:42.461 --> 01:19:44.122
Daddy!

01:20:16.161 --> 01:20:18.994
<i>You ever hear of chaos theory, Ed?</i>

01:20:19.164 --> 01:20:20.461
<i>It's a science.</i>

01:20:21.333 --> 01:20:24.325
It tries to determine underlying patterns
in chaotic systems:

01:20:24.503 --> 01:20:28.337
Weather, ocean currents, blood flow,
that sort of thing.

01:20:28.507 --> 01:20:31.601
Well, it turns out
that there are few things...

01:20:31.776 --> 01:20:35.177
...more chaotic than the beat
of a human heart.

01:20:35.347 --> 01:20:40.284
Speeding up, slowing down.
A pretty face, a flight of stairs.

01:20:40.452 --> 01:20:43.751
It's always changing depending
on what's happening to us out there.

01:20:43.922 --> 01:20:46.482
It's an erratic son of a bitch.

01:20:47.158 --> 01:20:51.788
But underneath all of that bump-a-ta-bump
mess, there is, in fact, a pattern.

01:20:51.963 --> 01:20:53.760
A truth.

01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:55.593
And it's love.

01:20:56.134 --> 01:21:00.036
The most important thing about love
is that we choose to give it...

01:21:00.205 --> 01:21:02.730
...and we choose to receive it.

01:21:03.275 --> 01:21:06.870
Making it the least random act
in the entire universe.

01:21:07.045 --> 01:21:09.946
It transcends blood,
it transcends betrayal...

01:21:10.115 --> 01:21:13.141
...and all the dirt that makes us human.

01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:16.880
And if you can figure that out...

01:21:17.055 --> 01:21:19.888
...the Jake Lees of the world
got nothing on you.

01:21:20.058 --> 01:21:21.616
Now, what's all this about?

01:21:21.793 --> 01:21:22.953
Uh-oh.

01:21:23.128 --> 01:21:26.188
Poor Ed, has Frank been torturing you
with tales of love and war?

01:21:26.364 --> 01:21:28.958
- Well, yes, ma'am.
- You're gonna be late.

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.293
I'll see you in there.

01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:36.632
Thanks.

01:21:41.446 --> 01:21:43.971
- Have you been bad?
- No.

01:21:48.787 --> 01:21:50.254
A little bit.

01:21:51.456 --> 01:21:54.550
Come on, let's go.
Monster, we're gonna be late.

01:22:09.207 --> 01:22:12.836
- You're beautiful.
- I'm nervous, Daddy.

01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:14.376
Jake loves you very much.

01:22:14.546 --> 01:22:17.447
- Ed.
- He loves you too, honey.

01:22:48.413 --> 01:22:52.042
Friends,
we have been invited here today...

01:22:52.217 --> 01:22:56.620
...to share in a most important moment
in the lives for Edward and Jessica.

01:22:56.788 --> 01:22:59.007
In the time they've been together...

01:27:18.883 --> 01:27:20.875
