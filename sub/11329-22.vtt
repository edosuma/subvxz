WEBVTT

00:02.972 --> 00:05.507
Oh, I can't believe
I'm getting married.
It's really exciting.

00:05.508 --> 00:07.876
I don't know what I did
to deserve all this happiness.

00:07.877 --> 00:09.544
Well, she and I
threw you a baby shower,

00:09.545 --> 00:12.347
so I thought maybe you and I
should throw her a baby shower.

00:12.348 --> 00:13.615
Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

00:13.616 --> 00:14.782
I just wanted

00:14.783 --> 00:15.917
to say thank you
for the shower.

00:15.918 --> 00:18.086
No. What you really
wanted to do

00:18.087 --> 00:20.188
was let me know that everything
went well with Ben.

00:20.189 --> 00:22.757
Do I really need to know
that Adrian and Ben
are having sex?

00:22.758 --> 00:24.692
Apparently everyone knows,

00:24.693 --> 00:27.362
just like everyone knows
you and Amy probably aren't
having sex.

00:27.363 --> 00:30.431
I wanna sleep with you, Amy.
I know.

00:30.432 --> 00:33.768
And?
I want our relationship
to be more than sex.

00:33.769 --> 00:37.071
I've been running around all day
getting ideas for that shower
you're gonna throw next week.

00:37.072 --> 00:40.508
I told you I would do it.
Yeah, but you did it last time,
and it was totally lame.

00:40.509 --> 00:43.111
Grace, Kathleen,
you've met my mother Carrie.

00:43.112 --> 00:46.080
And this is Grant's father
Vic Foeburg.

00:46.081 --> 00:48.216
I can't wait
to start our lives together.

00:48.217 --> 00:51.920
Well, I think we're off
to a really hot start.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:02.164 --> 01:04.399
These are really clever.
And they're cute.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.967
They're really cute.
Did you make them?

01:05.968 --> 01:08.069
Yeah. I did.
Well, my mom and I did.

01:08.070 --> 01:09.904
Actually, it was just my mom.

01:09.905 --> 01:12.106
She doesn't really have
anything to do right now
with her husband away.

01:12.107 --> 01:13.541
I think they're great.

01:13.542 --> 01:15.510
And we could put them
in a scrapbook for her

01:15.511 --> 01:17.845
along with the photos
and the lists of gifts
and all that.

01:17.846 --> 01:19.347
Yeah.
Now all we need

01:19.348 --> 01:20.882
is the list
of who she wants to invite.

01:20.883 --> 01:23.117
Adrian told me you were
gonna come up with that.

01:23.118 --> 01:24.986
Well, no,
I can't come up with that.

01:24.987 --> 01:26.487
She has to
come up with that.

01:26.488 --> 01:28.189
If she gives me a list,
then I'll make sure

01:28.190 --> 01:29.457
everybody gets
the invitation.

01:29.458 --> 01:30.959
But I don't know
who she wants to invite.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.060
Yeah. I don't know either.

01:32.061 --> 01:34.262
I guess
all of her friends.

01:34.263 --> 01:35.830
Uh-huh.

01:35.831 --> 01:37.665
And who
would that be?

01:37.666 --> 01:39.267
I mean,
besides you and me?

01:39.268 --> 01:41.402
Yeah. We'll be there,
of course.

01:41.403 --> 01:43.171
But I don't know
who else should be there.

01:43.172 --> 01:45.273
Well, I'm sure
she has other friends.

01:45.274 --> 01:46.975
I mean,
your sister, for one.

01:46.976 --> 01:50.245
Yeah. I guess Adrian
would consider her a friend.

01:50.246 --> 01:52.947
Although I don't know
how much fun Ashley would be
at a shower,

01:52.948 --> 01:54.415
or if she'll
come to a shower.

01:54.416 --> 01:56.050
I barely got her
to come to my shower.

01:56.051 --> 01:58.152
What about your friends?
What about Madison and Lauren?

01:58.153 --> 02:00.555
Well, that's the thing.
They're my friends.

02:00.556 --> 02:02.590
I don't know if Adrian
considers them her friends.

02:04.493 --> 02:06.861
Well, wait a minute.
Alice. We can invite Alice.

02:06.862 --> 02:09.564
Invite me?
To Adrian's baby shower.

02:09.565 --> 02:11.566
It's this Saturday.
Oh, yeah. Look.

02:11.567 --> 02:13.134
These are really cute
invitations.

02:13.135 --> 02:14.902
Thank you.
That was my contribution.

02:14.903 --> 02:16.237
And I made the reservation

02:16.238 --> 02:17.538
and put the deposit down
at Jeff's.

02:17.539 --> 02:19.440
And Adrian wanted Amy
to come up with a list

02:19.441 --> 02:21.643
of girls to invite,
and you were at the top
of our list.

02:21.644 --> 02:23.378
Oh, that's so nice.

02:23.379 --> 02:25.346
But I didn't realize
it was this Saturday.

02:25.347 --> 02:29.550
And I think I have
a family obligation.
Oh.

02:29.551 --> 02:31.019
A bar mitzvah. Yeah.

02:31.020 --> 02:32.620
My cousin's bar mitzvah.

02:32.621 --> 02:33.988
But if I don't get there,

02:33.989 --> 02:35.523
I will definitely
send a gift.

02:35.524 --> 02:36.924
See you.

02:37.793 --> 02:39.260
A bar mitzvah?

02:39.261 --> 02:41.195
Maybe her dad's Jewish.

02:41.196 --> 02:43.965
[chuckles]
I think her mom's Buddhist.

02:43.966 --> 02:46.267
That's what she said
when we met her
at that school dance.

02:46.268 --> 02:48.569
Oh, the night
Adrian and Ben...

02:48.570 --> 02:50.038
Yeah.

02:50.039 --> 02:51.472
Anyway, my point is

02:51.473 --> 02:53.474
that families
can be mixed religions,

02:53.475 --> 02:55.977
mixed races,
mixed ethnicities.

02:55.978 --> 02:58.246
True. But I think
the bar mitzvah

02:58.247 --> 03:00.315
was a little white lie
to get her out of this.

03:00.316 --> 03:02.917
Are those the invitations
to my shower?

03:02.918 --> 03:04.252
Yeah.
Yeah.

03:04.253 --> 03:06.020
Amy's still working
on the invitation list.

03:06.021 --> 03:08.823
I was hoping that maybe
you'd give me a list of friends

03:08.824 --> 03:10.158
you'd like to invite.

03:10.159 --> 03:12.660
Friends?
I don't have any friends.

03:12.661 --> 03:14.028
Sure you do.

03:14.029 --> 03:15.496
No, I don't,

03:15.497 --> 03:17.765
other than you two
and maybe your sister.

03:17.766 --> 03:20.601
That's kind of iffy.
So it'll just
be the three of us?

03:22.037 --> 03:24.038
Well, I made 20 invitations.

03:24.039 --> 03:25.406
My mom did.

03:26.809 --> 03:29.977
Let's put them to good use.

03:29.978 --> 03:32.046
I wanna invite the girls
who thought that I got

03:32.047 --> 03:33.915
just what I deserved
when I got pregnant.

03:33.916 --> 03:36.517
I wanna invite the girls
who were mean to me

03:36.518 --> 03:38.319
before I got pregnant.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.388
I don't want friends there.
I want enemies.

03:40.389 --> 03:43.925
I wanna show them
all just how great

03:43.926 --> 03:45.893
my life is now.

03:48.297 --> 03:49.797
Hey, Zoe.

03:49.798 --> 03:51.833
Oh, hey, Adrian.
What's up?

03:51.834 --> 03:53.835
Amy and Grace
are throwing me

03:53.836 --> 03:55.703
a baby/wedding shower,

03:55.704 --> 03:58.039
and you're invited.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.975
Why are you inviting me?

04:00.976 --> 04:03.077
I slept with your boyfriend.

04:03.078 --> 04:04.645
Although now
he's your boyfriend.

04:04.646 --> 04:08.383
Although he used to be
your boyfriend, too, right?

04:08.384 --> 04:09.717
Yeah.

04:09.718 --> 04:11.586
God, are you just gonna invite
every girl

04:11.587 --> 04:13.955
that Ricky ever slept with?
Maybe.

04:15.624 --> 04:18.559
Candy, Robin, Cheryl!

04:18.560 --> 04:20.795
And every girl
who slept with Ricky

04:20.796 --> 04:22.497
when he was with Adrian!

04:22.498 --> 04:24.332
[chattering]

04:28.804 --> 04:31.572
No, thanks.

04:31.573 --> 04:32.907
Can't.

04:32.908 --> 04:34.208
Thanks anyway.

04:40.783 --> 04:42.483
You know,

04:42.484 --> 04:44.018
I really don't have
an excuse.

04:44.019 --> 04:46.087
I just don't want
to get you a gift.

04:55.030 --> 04:57.031
Did you do that
just to show me

04:57.032 --> 04:58.433
how many girls
Ricky slept with?

04:58.434 --> 05:00.101
No, I did not do that
just to show you

05:00.102 --> 05:01.903
how many girls
Ricky has slept with.

05:01.904 --> 05:04.872
And those aren't all the girls
Ricky has slept with.

05:04.873 --> 05:06.274
Geez, Amy,
this isn't about you.

05:06.275 --> 05:08.042
Okay? This is about me.

05:08.043 --> 05:09.911
I just want them to know
that I won,

05:09.912 --> 05:12.613
that I came out on top
and that I'm getting everything
that I ever wanted

05:12.614 --> 05:14.649
and then some,
and they're not.

05:14.650 --> 05:16.984
[scoffs]

05:17.986 --> 05:20.121
Sorry. I'm out.

05:22.191 --> 05:23.524
Can you believe that?

05:23.525 --> 05:25.526
Adrian, run after her
and apologize.

05:25.527 --> 05:27.695
That was a terrible thing
to do to her.
What--

05:27.696 --> 05:31.766
It's not like she didn't know
Ricky's been with other girls.

05:31.767 --> 05:33.901
Oh, that probably wasn't even
half of them.

05:33.902 --> 05:36.304
Those were just the ones
that slept with him
when I was with him.

05:36.305 --> 05:38.473
And, again, this isn't
about Amy, okay?

05:38.474 --> 05:40.675
This is about me,
all right?

05:40.676 --> 05:42.176
Those girls were mean to me,

05:42.177 --> 05:43.811
and they always thought
they were better than me.

05:43.812 --> 05:45.546
Okay, well, I don't know
anything about those girls,

05:45.547 --> 05:47.215
but I do know something
about Amy.

05:47.216 --> 05:48.716
And after everything
you guys have been through,

05:48.717 --> 05:50.585
after all the competition
between you two,

05:50.586 --> 05:52.153
she was still willing
to be your friend

05:52.154 --> 05:54.722
and throw you a baby shower.

05:56.291 --> 05:58.292
Oh, no. Please tell me

05:58.293 --> 05:59.727
you didn't want Amy
to do all this

05:59.728 --> 06:01.929
so you could rub it in her face
that you won,

06:01.930 --> 06:03.264
that you got her boyfriend,

06:03.265 --> 06:05.266
and you're having a baby
with her boyfriend,

06:05.267 --> 06:07.768
and you're marrying
her boyfriend?

06:07.769 --> 06:09.337
So what?

06:09.338 --> 06:11.339
She has my boyfriend.

06:11.340 --> 06:13.941
She already had a baby
with my boyfriend.

06:13.942 --> 06:16.244
And her old boyfriend
is way better

06:16.245 --> 06:18.446
than my old boyfriend, so...

06:18.447 --> 06:20.248
I did win.

06:20.249 --> 06:22.783
And maybe you ought
to take a look at yourself.

06:22.784 --> 06:25.486
If you and Amy had come up
with a list of people to invite,

06:25.487 --> 06:28.556
then I wouldn't feel as if
you were throwing it in my face

06:28.557 --> 06:31.158
that I have no friends
at a time when I need friends.

07:00.188 --> 07:04.458
Amy, are you okay?
No, I'm not okay.

07:04.459 --> 07:06.494
You wouldn't believe
what Adrian did to me
before school.

07:06.495 --> 07:08.763
Oh, we heard.
Yeah, that was really lousy.

07:08.764 --> 07:10.765
Yeah, and she just wanted
to embarrass me

07:10.766 --> 07:13.100
by pointing out how many girls
Ricky has been with.

07:13.101 --> 07:16.170
And it's not like I don't know
that Ricky has been
with a lot of girls.

07:16.171 --> 07:19.907
I just didn't need to see them
all in one place at one time
like that.

07:19.908 --> 07:21.475
And not that
that was all of them.

07:21.476 --> 07:22.977
No, not hardly.

07:22.978 --> 07:24.545
But you can't
let her get to you,

07:24.546 --> 07:26.580
especially when things
are going so well with Ricky.

07:26.581 --> 07:29.150
Easier said than done.
You know,
it's one thing to know

07:29.151 --> 07:30.518
that he's slept
with other girls,

07:30.519 --> 07:32.186
it's another
to actually see them.

07:32.187 --> 07:35.156
I'm sorry, Amy.

07:35.157 --> 07:37.158
Why did she do it?
Did she have a reason?

07:37.159 --> 07:39.193
She says that she doesn't

07:39.194 --> 07:41.095
have friends
to invite to the shower,

07:41.096 --> 07:43.297
so she's going to invite
her enemies.

07:43.298 --> 07:45.433
And those are her enemies--

07:45.434 --> 07:48.836
girls who slept with Ricky.

07:48.837 --> 07:51.706
Wow. That's a lot
of enemies.

07:51.707 --> 07:54.575
Look, Amy, the whole idea
of you throwing a shower
for Adrian

07:54.576 --> 07:56.977
was ridiculous
in the first place.

07:56.978 --> 07:58.279
Yeah, why were you
gonna do that?

07:58.280 --> 08:00.047
Because she threw me a shower.

08:00.048 --> 08:02.316
Well, she was having sex
in her bedroom

08:02.317 --> 08:04.185
with her stepbrother
during your shower.

08:04.186 --> 08:06.253
What?
You didn't know?

08:06.254 --> 08:08.522
No. I didn't even know
she had a stepbrother.

08:08.523 --> 08:10.524
It's her dad's ex-wife's son.

08:10.525 --> 08:12.526
So they're not like
really related or anything.

08:12.527 --> 08:15.396
You know,
whatever she was doing
during my shower--

08:15.397 --> 08:16.797
what difference
does it make?

08:16.798 --> 08:18.365
She gave me a shower.

08:18.366 --> 08:20.201
Well, that doesn't mean
that you owe her one back.

08:20.202 --> 08:22.336
Yeah, it doesn't mean
you owe her anything.

08:22.337 --> 08:24.338
Adrian's been a witch lately.

08:24.339 --> 08:26.941
And, I mean, I feel badly
that she's having a baby

08:26.942 --> 08:29.243
that she hadn't planned
and she's still in high school,

08:29.244 --> 08:30.811
but she did this to herself.

08:30.812 --> 08:32.145
Well, not exactly.

08:32.147 --> 08:33.948
You know what I mean.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.783
Actions have consequences.

08:35.784 --> 08:37.351
And--
And, Amy,

08:37.352 --> 08:41.522
I hate to say it,
but you really
did this to yourself.

08:41.523 --> 08:43.691
It's not that we don't feel
really badly for you, but--

08:43.692 --> 08:46.393
Oh, yeah,
we feel badly for you.

08:46.394 --> 08:49.797
That's not a pretty picture--
all those girls in the hallway.

08:49.798 --> 08:51.499
Not pretty at all.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.068
You know, maybe you should've
just come up with who to invite.

08:54.069 --> 08:55.536
So you're sayjng
it's my fault

08:55.537 --> 08:57.705
because I agreed to do
something nice for Adrian.

08:57.706 --> 09:00.040
Well, kind of.

09:00.041 --> 09:01.375
You're just too nice.
Yeah.

09:01.376 --> 09:03.144
You always have been.
Mmm.

09:03.145 --> 09:05.045
That's how
this whole thing started--

09:05.046 --> 09:07.782
you were too nice to Ricky
when you had sex with him
at band camp.

09:07.783 --> 09:08.883
Thanks.

09:08.884 --> 09:10.518
Thanks a lot.

09:10.519 --> 09:13.287
It's nice to know
what my friends really think.

09:16.391 --> 09:19.960
Well, she was too nice.
Way too nice.

09:19.961 --> 09:21.562
Well, maybe you
were too hard on her.

09:21.563 --> 09:23.664
Maybe you were
too hard on her.

09:23.665 --> 09:26.834
And, really, I don't know why
she'd be nice to Adrian.

09:26.835 --> 09:28.969
Adrian is not nice to her.

09:28.970 --> 09:31.839
She's not nice to anybody,
except maybe Ben.

09:31.840 --> 09:35.509
Yeah. No wonder
she doesn't have any friends
to invite to her shower.

09:35.510 --> 09:37.511
You know,
I'd say something to Adrian

09:37.512 --> 09:39.780
if she wasn't having a baby.
Mm-hmm.

09:39.781 --> 09:41.849
Oh, would you?

09:41.850 --> 09:44.118
Well, just ignore
that I'm having a baby

09:44.119 --> 09:46.520
and say what you wanna say.

09:46.521 --> 09:47.721
Uh...

09:47.722 --> 09:50.724
It's a natural process--
having a baby.

09:50.725 --> 09:52.927
It's not like I'm sick
or I'm dying or anything,

09:52.928 --> 09:54.728
so say what you wanna say,

09:54.729 --> 09:57.031
O best friends
of Amy Juergens.

09:57.032 --> 09:59.066
Uh, I, um...

09:59.067 --> 10:00.768
I just, uh--

10:00.769 --> 10:04.705
We were hoping
to go to your shower.

10:04.706 --> 10:05.773
Yeah.

10:05.774 --> 10:07.775
And I guess
we weren't invited,

10:07.776 --> 10:11.345
and that really
hurt our feelings.

10:11.346 --> 10:13.113
You two are liars.

10:13.114 --> 10:15.082
Hurt your feelings?

10:15.083 --> 10:17.351
I didn't hurt your feelings.

10:17.352 --> 10:19.854
Your friend Amy
hurt my feelings.

10:19.855 --> 10:22.723
But don't worry.
I don't expect you
to take my side in this.

10:22.724 --> 10:26.293
I don't need you
or anybody else to take
my side in this.

10:32.133 --> 10:34.568
Okay, you are not
a very good liar.

10:34.569 --> 10:37.771
I was just
trying to spare her
from more pain.

10:37.772 --> 10:39.840
Oh, so you're
taking Adrian's side.

10:39.841 --> 10:41.442
No, I'm not.

10:41.443 --> 10:44.345
I'm always on Amy's side
even when she's wrong.

10:44.346 --> 10:46.080
And I'm not
saying she's wrong.

10:46.081 --> 10:49.450
Well, was she or wasn't she?

10:52.354 --> 10:54.421
Hey, Adrian.

10:54.422 --> 10:56.423
I've been looking
for you.

10:56.424 --> 10:58.425
I was in the bathroom
washing my face.

10:58.426 --> 11:02.029
Stupid Amy made me cry
messed up my eyeliner.

11:02.030 --> 11:03.998
This pregnancy
is making me all girlie.

11:03.999 --> 11:06.834
Amy made you cry?
Yes.

11:06.835 --> 11:10.070
I'm sure you don't think
little Miss Teen Mother
Role Model

11:10.071 --> 11:12.606
did anything wrong,
but she did.
What-- No, no, no.

11:12.607 --> 11:14.008
I would believe she did
something wrong

11:14.009 --> 11:15.342
if you say
she did something Ã§rong.

11:15.343 --> 11:17.111
What did she do?

11:17.112 --> 11:20.648
She embarrassed me
by pointing out

11:20.649 --> 11:23.550
that I have no friends
to invite to my shower.

11:23.551 --> 11:26.053
You have friends.
You have plenty of friends.

11:26.054 --> 11:27.721
No, I don't.

11:27.722 --> 11:29.556
I don't have
any friends at all.

11:29.557 --> 11:31.058
Well,

11:31.059 --> 11:32.559
except for you.

11:32.560 --> 11:34.929
And you're all that I need.

11:34.930 --> 11:36.730
[sighs]

11:36.731 --> 11:39.166
I'm gonna have a word with Amy,
if you don't mind.

11:39.167 --> 11:41.335
No, I don't mind.

11:41.336 --> 11:44.738
But I'm sure Ricky
would mind.

11:44.739 --> 11:47.274
So maybe
you'd better not.

11:47.275 --> 11:49.310
Yeah, well, I don't care
if Ricky minds.

11:49.311 --> 11:51.312
No one's gonna make
the mother of my baby

11:51.313 --> 11:53.614
and my future wife cry
at school.

11:55.817 --> 11:57.918
They were all
just standing there
right in front of me--

11:57.919 --> 12:00.087
all those girls
that you ever slept with.

12:00.088 --> 12:02.022
I think
she did it on purpose,

12:02.023 --> 12:04.058
because I think that
she's still in love with you.

12:04.059 --> 12:06.493
Even though she's having a baby
and getting married to Ben,

12:06.494 --> 12:09.630
I think she's still in love
with you, and she doesn't
want you to be with me.

12:09.631 --> 12:12.232
Adrian is not
still in love with me.
That's ridiculous.

12:12.233 --> 12:13.600
And I don't care anyway.

12:13.601 --> 12:16.070
You know,
I care about you.

12:16.071 --> 12:18.339
You said you loved me.

12:18.340 --> 12:21.141
Yeah. Not at school, okay?
That's personal.

12:21.142 --> 12:22.943
And Adrian knows
I care about you,

12:22.944 --> 12:25.646
and she doesn't care
about anyone
but herself right now.

12:25.647 --> 12:28.649
She's having a baby.
Yeah, well, I had a baby.

12:28.650 --> 12:29.683
Yeah, and?

12:29.684 --> 12:32.252
And I cared about people
other than myself.

12:32.253 --> 12:34.054
Okay.

12:34.055 --> 12:36.190
"Okay"?

12:36.191 --> 12:37.424
Whose side are you on?

12:37.425 --> 12:39.093
No one's.
I'm staying out of this.

12:39.094 --> 12:41.729
Oh, really?
And how are you
going to do that?

12:41.730 --> 12:43.497
You're already in this.
How am I in this?

12:43.498 --> 12:46.133
Because you're the one
who slept with all the girls
in the hallway.

12:46.134 --> 12:48.936
I've slept with no one
since you asked me not to.

12:48.937 --> 12:50.804
And I suggest we drop this

12:50.805 --> 12:53.140
before neither of us wants
to sleep with the other one.

12:53.141 --> 12:54.408
What does that mean?

12:54.409 --> 12:56.410
It means just what I said.

12:56.411 --> 12:58.479
I'm staying out of this.

13:08.323 --> 13:09.623
Where do you think
you're going?

13:09.624 --> 13:10.858
I might ask you
the same thing.

13:10.859 --> 13:12.993
Look, you stay away
from Adrian.

13:12.994 --> 13:15.496
Amy's hurt her enough,
and I'm gonna go talk to Amy
about that right now.

13:15.497 --> 13:17.931
You're what?
She upset Adrian.

13:17.932 --> 13:20.467
Adrian is having a baby.
She should not be upset.

13:20.468 --> 13:22.469
I agree.
She shouldn't be upset.

13:22.470 --> 13:24.671
But you'd think
that since Adrian's pregnant

13:24.672 --> 13:26.740
and about to be a mother
that she'd be a little nicer

13:26.741 --> 13:28.342
to everyone else,
including Amy.

13:28.343 --> 13:29.777
No, you'd think
everybody else

13:29.778 --> 13:31.912
would be a little nicer to her,
including Amy.

13:31.913 --> 13:33.881
I told Amy
I'm staying out of this.

13:33.882 --> 13:36.383
And I'm staying out of this,
and I suggest you do the same.

13:36.384 --> 13:39.620
Just let Adrian and Amy
do whatever Adrian and Amy
are gonna do.

13:39.621 --> 13:41.388
Let's not you and me
get involved here.

13:41.389 --> 13:42.890
No. I'm involved.

13:42.891 --> 13:44.658
I'm plenty involved.
I'm talking to Amy.

13:44.659 --> 13:46.627
No, you're not.
You stay away from Amy.

13:46.628 --> 13:48.195
Anyou stay away
from Adrian.

13:48.196 --> 13:50.497
I wasn't going anywhere
near Adrian.

14:06.341 --> 14:08.809
ive her a list
of her friends,

14:08.810 --> 14:10.811
and Adrian doesn't
really have any friends.

14:10.812 --> 14:14.048
And she embarrassed her
in front of a whole
hallway of people.

14:14.049 --> 14:17.218
So you're not only insisting
on being involved
in this stupid fight,

14:17.219 --> 14:18.853
you're bringing Bunny
into this?

14:18.854 --> 14:20.187
We're off the clock,

14:20.188 --> 14:21.889
and Bunny is a friend
of my family,

14:21.890 --> 14:23.724
and this is
a private conversation.

14:23.725 --> 14:26.394
Guys, you can't keep bringing
this stuff into the workplace.

14:26.395 --> 14:29.163
I'm not, but if I were,
I'd tell you that Adrian

14:29.164 --> 14:31.866
wanted to invite
every girl I've ever slept with
to her shower

14:31.867 --> 14:34.568
just so she could show them
how much better her life is
without me,

14:34.569 --> 14:37.538
simultaneously showing Amy
how many girls I've slept with,

14:37.539 --> 14:39.607
and possibly
affecting our relationship

14:39.608 --> 14:41.842
when things just started
looking really good for us.

14:41.843 --> 14:43.611
Please. Is that what
Amy's telling you?

14:43.612 --> 14:45.212
Yeah, that's what Amy's
telling me,

14:45.213 --> 14:47.248
But, Ben,
this is a chick fight,

14:47.249 --> 14:48.683
and chick fights
are dangerous.

14:48.684 --> 14:50.851
Any fight between
any two people is dangerous.

14:50.852 --> 14:53.955
I know this.
I watched my parents
fight all the time,

14:53.956 --> 14:55.456
and I learned
to stay out of it.

14:55.457 --> 14:57.191
So let's agree
to stay out of it.

14:57.192 --> 14:59.360
There's Adrian's side,
and there's Amy's side,

14:59.361 --> 15:01.028
and we don't have a side.

15:01.029 --> 15:02.530
I have a side.

15:02.531 --> 15:05.099
I'm not a neutral party
and neither are you.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.634
But you could be,

15:06.635 --> 15:09.637
so let's shake hands
and come out not fighting.

15:09.638 --> 15:15.276
No offense,
but I'm not shaking hands.

15:16.611 --> 15:17.745
Hm.

15:22.584 --> 15:26.554
Look, I don't like
to have personal problems
going on at work,

15:26.555 --> 15:28.222
but this is the kind
of personal problem

15:28.223 --> 15:31.058
that can escalate
into a global problem.

15:31.059 --> 15:32.593
You know that,
and I know that.

15:32.594 --> 15:33.928
So let's get back in there

15:33.929 --> 15:35.963
and get Ben
and talk this through.

15:35.964 --> 15:38.132
I don't wanna talk.
I just wanna do my job.

15:38.133 --> 15:40.167
And I wanna do my job
without talking to anyone

15:40.168 --> 15:42.503
that I don't have to talk to,
if you don't mind.

15:42.504 --> 15:43.671
[scoffs]
I do mind.

15:43.672 --> 15:45.139
I'm telling you, I see it.

15:45.140 --> 15:47.475
This is gonna snowball
into hell.

15:47.476 --> 15:49.710
Not because of me.

15:53.448 --> 15:55.216
So you're taking his side?

15:55.217 --> 15:58.185
I'm not taking sides,
and you and Ricky
shouldn't take sides.

15:58.186 --> 16:00.821
So you agree with Ricky.
Of course.

16:00.822 --> 16:02.857
When you take sides,
the rest of the world

16:02.858 --> 16:05.793
lines up behind one
or the other of you, so--

16:05.794 --> 16:08.362
So fine.
I'm taking Adrian's side.

16:08.363 --> 16:11.198
And it makes me really angry
that other people
don't take her side

16:11.199 --> 16:13.167
because they're too busy
judging her.

16:13.168 --> 16:14.769
Somehow she got labeled
as the bad girl,

16:14.770 --> 16:16.437
and no matter
what she does or says,

16:16.438 --> 16:18.439
people wanna think of her
as the bad girl.

16:18.440 --> 16:21.942
"Somehow"?
"Somehow she got labeled
as a bad girl"?

16:21.943 --> 16:23.644
We're one and the same--
Adrian and me.

16:23.645 --> 16:26.047
We've both been
with too many people
for all the wrong reasons.

16:26.048 --> 16:29.116
And admit it,
Adrian always seems
to enjoy things better

16:29.117 --> 16:31.952
if things include
getting back at people
along the way--

16:31.953 --> 16:34.155
me, her mother, her father.

16:34.156 --> 16:35.322
Anyone. Even you.

16:35.323 --> 16:37.291
This is not
getting in the middle?

16:37.292 --> 16:39.593
Well--
I'm just telling you
what I know.

16:39.594 --> 16:41.462
I know her,
and I know Amy.

16:41.463 --> 16:44.365
And that fight today
was probably as much
one's fault as the other's.

16:44.366 --> 16:47.068
So let's stay out of it,
and that's the last time
I'm saying that.

16:47.069 --> 16:49.336
Let's not.
At this point,

16:49.337 --> 16:51.505
I know Adrian better
than you know Adrian,

16:51.506 --> 16:54.275
and she was not out
to hurt anyone at school today.

16:54.276 --> 16:56.210
I know that.
You do not know that.

16:56.211 --> 16:58.813
You don't know anything
about that fight,
and neither do I.

16:58.814 --> 17:00.514
And we can't
possibly really know

17:00.515 --> 17:02.016
what Amy's motivation was

17:02.017 --> 17:03.717
for not having
the invitation list,

17:03.718 --> 17:05.185
or Adrian's motivation

17:07.686 --> 17:09.887
for including girls I slept with
on the invitation list,

17:09.888 --> 17:11.823
or if either of them
even had a motivation.

17:11.824 --> 17:15.093
What's your real reason
for not coming to Amy's defense?

17:15.094 --> 17:17.896
I think you're still
in love with Adrian.
That's the problem.

17:17.896 --> 17:19.998
You're still in love with her.
I was never in love with her.

17:19.999 --> 17:21.299
No, you were in love with her.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.367
You told her you were
in love wither.

17:23.368 --> 17:26.171
I told all of those girls
I was in love with them, too.

17:29.542 --> 17:32.744
What do you mean
you don't know
if there's gonna be a shower?

17:32.745 --> 17:35.747
After that, there's still
supposed to be a shower?

17:35.748 --> 17:38.083
I froze four dozen cupcakes
this afternoon

17:38.084 --> 17:42.053
that I baked from scratch
and made little
teeny-tiny roses for.

17:42.054 --> 17:43.388
There's gonna be a shower.

17:43.389 --> 17:45.123
Mom, there's no one to invite.

17:45.124 --> 17:48.126
I'm not gonna invite
a bunch of mean girls
who slept with Ricky.

17:48.127 --> 17:50.762
I can't do that.
I can't ask Amy
to buy them lunch.

17:50.763 --> 17:51.997
That's crazy.

17:51.998 --> 17:53.865
There must be at least
four or five girls

17:53.866 --> 17:55.867
Adrian knows from majorettes
or from...

17:55.868 --> 17:58.136
Well, what else was she
involved in at school?

17:58.137 --> 17:59.938
Nothing.

17:59.939 --> 18:03.608
And come on.
Everybody knows the majorettes
are all sluts.

18:03.609 --> 18:05.443
Grace!

18:05.444 --> 18:07.979
You know that's not true.
I know.

18:07.980 --> 18:09.981
I guess Adrian's not that close
with them.

18:09.982 --> 18:12.484
It doesn't mean
they can't be friends.

18:12.485 --> 18:14.285
I'll try.

18:14.286 --> 18:17.589
It just seems like Adrian
wants the shower
for all the wrong reasons.

18:17.590 --> 18:19.457
Stop being so judgmental, honey.

18:19.458 --> 18:22.827
I mean, maybe she just
wants a shower
because she wants a shower.

18:22.828 --> 18:25.430
Most brides and mothers-to-be
want to have a shower,

18:25.431 --> 18:28.466
and most of the time
their friends and family
wanna give them a shower.

18:28.467 --> 18:31.136
And I've already spent
too much time

18:31.137 --> 18:32.971
and too much money on this
for you to just give up.

18:32.972 --> 18:35.640
And you've spent too much time
and too much effort

18:35.641 --> 18:37.776
on your friendship with Adrian
to just give up.

18:37.777 --> 18:39.711
I don't wanna spend
any more time or effort

18:39.712 --> 18:41.179
on this friendship
or the shower.

18:41.180 --> 18:43.515
I really don't.
Maybe if you weren't so busy

18:43.516 --> 18:45.550
having sex with Grant,
you would have more time

18:45.551 --> 18:47.419
and energy for your friends
and for this shower.

18:47.420 --> 18:49.487
I know, but given the choice--

18:49.488 --> 18:51.322
You don't have a choice.

18:51.323 --> 18:52.857
There's gonna be a shower.

18:52.858 --> 18:54.926
And if you and Adrian
are the only two people there,

18:54.927 --> 18:56.795
you're not gonna feel
very good about it,

18:56.796 --> 18:59.330
and neither is she
and neither am I.

19:01.167 --> 19:03.034
Mom, it was like a nightmare.

19:03.035 --> 19:05.704
All of them standing there,
staring at me.

19:05.705 --> 19:07.872
Well, were they staring at you,
or were they staring at Adrian?

19:07.873 --> 19:09.874
Okay, fine.
They were staring at Adrian,

19:09.875 --> 19:11.543
and I was staring at them,
because--

19:11.544 --> 19:13.211
How could she
do that to me? How?

19:13.212 --> 19:15.947
Well, I'm not so sure that
she was doing anything to you.

19:15.948 --> 19:18.416
<i>At least she didn't plan
on doing anything to you.</i>

19:18.417 --> 19:20.985
Just walk over next door
and talk to her.

19:20.986 --> 19:23.688
Just apologize if you did
anything to offend her,

19:23.689 --> 19:25.256
and just work it out, Amy.

19:25.257 --> 19:28.293
What? If I did anything?
How about if she did anything?

19:28.294 --> 19:30.295
Well, so what
if she did something?

19:30.296 --> 19:32.697
<i>She's very pregnant,
and she and Ben
are getting married.</i>

19:32.698 --> 19:35.900
She's probably under
a lot of stress,
so just give her a break and--

19:35.901 --> 19:38.470
[beeping]
Hold on. There's someone
on the other line.

19:38.471 --> 19:40.038
[beeps]
Hello?

19:40.039 --> 19:41.306
Amy, is that you?

19:41.307 --> 19:42.307
Who is this?

19:42.308 --> 19:43.341
Oh. Sorry.

19:43.342 --> 19:45.076
It's Kathleen Tseguay.

19:45.077 --> 19:46.077
Who?

19:46.078 --> 19:47.912
Kathleen, Grace's mom.

19:47.913 --> 19:49.080
Oh, hi.

19:49.081 --> 19:50.882
Uh, I'm on the other line
with my mom.

19:50.883 --> 19:52.984
Oh, well, I was hoping
to talk to your dad.

19:52.985 --> 19:56.054
[beeps]
Mom,

19:56.055 --> 19:58.056
<i>that's Kathleen Bowman.</i>

19:58.057 --> 20:00.792
Or some other name.
Wife number one.

20:00.793 --> 20:02.494
<i>She wants to speak with Dad.</i>

20:02.495 --> 20:03.895
Well, then let her
speak to Dad.

20:03.896 --> 20:05.396
Good night, Amy.
I love you.

20:05.397 --> 20:07.932
[beeps]
Dad!

20:07.933 --> 20:10.034
You love me?
It's our first date.

20:10.035 --> 20:12.604
It's not our first date.
I wasn't talking to you.

20:12.605 --> 20:14.672
Fine. I don't wanna
talk anyway.

20:19.145 --> 20:20.345
Hello?

20:20.346 --> 20:21.379
George.

20:21.380 --> 20:24.616
Who is this?
Kathleen.

20:24.617 --> 20:27.418
Kathleen Smith
Juergens Bowman Tseguay?

20:27.419 --> 20:28.887
That's the one.

20:32.448 --> 20:33.515
You wanted to see me?

20:33.516 --> 20:35.717
Yes. I wanted
to ask you something.

20:35.718 --> 20:37.953
[sniffs]
Is that you?

20:37.954 --> 20:39.354
Are you wearing cologne?

20:39.355 --> 20:41.490
Is that what
you wanted to ask me?

20:41.491 --> 20:45.460
You call me all the way
from the guest house,

20:45.461 --> 20:48.697
and you ask me
if I am wearing cologne?

20:48.698 --> 20:50.132
What? No.

20:50.133 --> 20:52.000
I called you up here to ask
if you know

20:52.001 --> 20:54.169
if Adrian has any friends
or girlfriends.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.670
Has she ever mentioned
any girlfriends to you?

20:55.671 --> 20:59.141
I don't know anything
about any girlfriends.

20:59.142 --> 21:01.443
Hers or mine.
Good night.

21:01.444 --> 21:02.377
Are you sure?

21:02.378 --> 21:05.247
I am sure.
What about Tammy?

21:05.248 --> 21:07.048
Do you think Tammy would go
to a shower for Adrian?

21:07.049 --> 21:10.719
Would my old girlfriend

21:10.720 --> 21:15.590
go to a shower for a woman
I still love?

21:15.591 --> 21:16.958
I doubt it.

21:16.959 --> 21:18.493
Help me.

21:18.494 --> 21:20.695
I need to find someone
to go to Adrian's shower.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.697
I think Mom's doing that.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.833
No. She's doing
a bunch of other stuff,

21:24.834 --> 21:26.334
and I'm supposed to do that.

21:26.335 --> 21:28.036
She told me to find
a bunch of girls

21:28.037 --> 21:30.806
to go to Adrian's shower.
[huffs]

21:30.807 --> 21:33.241
Yeah. Poor Grace.

21:33.242 --> 21:35.377
You got it really tough.

21:35.378 --> 21:38.280
You're beautiful,
you're smart,

21:38.281 --> 21:40.382
you have boyfriend,

21:40.383 --> 21:43.585
and yet you always do
is complain, complain, complain.

21:43.586 --> 21:46.087
That's not a very nice thing
to say to me, Tom.

21:46.088 --> 21:48.089
Well, that's not nice

21:48.090 --> 21:51.393
to say Adrian has no friends.

21:51.394 --> 21:53.995
You could make her feel bad.

21:53.996 --> 21:57.065
I never said that.
I didn't make her feel bad.

21:57.066 --> 21:58.400
Amy made her feel bad.

21:58.401 --> 22:00.769
Then I don't like you or Amy.

22:00.770 --> 22:03.171
Why? Because you're still
in love with Adrian?

22:03.172 --> 22:06.374
Maybe if you got over her,
you'd find someone else
to go out with.

22:06.375 --> 22:09.144
You think you know everything,

22:09.145 --> 22:11.613
but if you're really smart,

22:11.614 --> 22:15.150
you wouldn't have sex
with every guy you date.

22:15.151 --> 22:16.718
I can't believe
you just said that.

22:16.719 --> 22:18.520
I said it, and I meant it.

22:18.521 --> 22:20.222
[scoffs]

22:20.223 --> 22:23.892
Tom! Wait!
I need to talk to you!

22:23.893 --> 22:25.560
You stink, you know that?

22:25.561 --> 22:27.729
I don't stink!
You stink!

22:27.730 --> 22:29.731
You and your cologne!

22:29.732 --> 22:31.399
[laughs]
I know.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.502
That was the funniest thing
you ever did--

22:33.503 --> 22:35.770
putting those bunk beds
in our bedroom and...

22:35.771 --> 22:38.406
Oh. Hi, Grace.
Do you need something?

22:38.407 --> 22:40.942
Who are you talking to?
Do you need something?

22:40.943 --> 22:43.311
No.

22:43.312 --> 22:45.714
Grace just walked in,
so I should probably go.

22:45.715 --> 22:48.183
I thought you were sick
of talking to teenagers.
I know I am.

22:48.184 --> 22:49.451
I didn't say that.

22:49.452 --> 22:50.785
No, you said that,
and I agreed with you.

22:50.786 --> 22:53.188
No, no. You said it,
and I agreed with you.

22:53.189 --> 22:55.423
<i>Mom--
Yeah, well, despite that,</i>

22:55.424 --> 22:57.692
you have to talk to Grace,
and I have to talk to Amy.

22:57.693 --> 22:59.794
Good luck.
You, too. Good night.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.296
[beeps]

23:01.297 --> 23:03.231
That wasn't Jeff.

23:03.232 --> 23:05.033
No, it wasn't.

23:05.034 --> 23:06.568
It was George Juergens.

23:06.569 --> 23:08.570
I called him to ask
if he would encourage Amy

23:08.571 --> 23:11.106
to work things out
with Adrian.
Why?

23:11.107 --> 23:14.309
I told you,
Adrian should be the one
to work things out with Amy.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.177
Either way,
they should work it out.

23:16.178 --> 23:17.879
Just so we can have
the stupid shower?

23:17.880 --> 23:20.815
No, not so we can have
the stupid shower.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.050
Because they're friends.

23:22.051 --> 23:24.920
And are you and George
friends now?

23:24.921 --> 23:26.922
[scoffs]
Come on, Grace.

23:26.923 --> 23:28.156
George is George.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.791
You wouldn't...

23:29.792 --> 23:31.793
Cheat on Jeff?

23:31.794 --> 23:34.129
No, I wouldn't.

23:34.130 --> 23:37.432
Were you about to say
that I've done that before?

23:37.433 --> 23:39.467
I cheated before
when I was married to George?

23:39.468 --> 23:42.737
Maybe, but I didn't.

23:42.738 --> 23:46.107
You're on restriction.
Starting now.

23:46.108 --> 23:48.143
So I can't throw that shower?

23:50.580 --> 23:53.348
Can't anyone else
answer the stupid door?

23:53.349 --> 23:55.784
[George]
No! And ask who it is!

23:55.785 --> 23:58.420
Duh. Who is it?
Ben.

23:59.755 --> 24:02.457
I'd like to speak with you,
if I may.

24:02.458 --> 24:04.192
Yeah, you may.
Come on in.

24:08.531 --> 24:10.532
I don't really have
a lot of time.

24:10.533 --> 24:13.068
I was just cutting John's nails,
and he hates that.

24:13.069 --> 24:15.070
I have to study for calculus,
and I hate that.

24:15.071 --> 24:16.271
Hi, John.

24:16.272 --> 24:18.273
Wanna sit down?

24:18.274 --> 24:20.275
Yeah, if you don't mind.

24:20.276 --> 24:23.044
"If you don't mind,
if I may"...

24:23.045 --> 24:25.180
I know what this is about.

24:26.415 --> 24:29.484
Hey, Dad,
will you get John?

24:29.485 --> 24:32.921
Okay. Go on, buddy.

24:35.725 --> 24:37.392
[grunts]
Got him!

24:37.393 --> 24:41.162
I'm really upset with you,
but I'm trying to be polite.

24:41.163 --> 24:43.031
I don't have time
for polite.

24:43.032 --> 24:44.899
Just tell me
why you're upset.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.468
Say what you wanna say.

24:46.469 --> 24:48.737
Like I don't already know.

24:48.738 --> 24:52.340
So you do know
that you were rude to Adrian
and made her cry.

24:52.341 --> 24:54.709
Adrian was rude to me
and made me cry.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.578
In response to what
you did to her.

24:56.579 --> 24:58.613
Which was try to throw her
a baby shower.

24:58.614 --> 25:00.115
No. Which was to point out

25:00.116 --> 25:02.117
that she has no friends
to come to a baby shower.

25:02.118 --> 25:03.451
I was not doing that.

25:03.452 --> 25:04.919
I just didn't know
who to invite.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.022
That was her job--
to come up with a list.

25:07.023 --> 25:08.657
She doesn't have a list.

25:08.658 --> 25:10.425
Oh, no, no.
She did have a list.

25:10.426 --> 25:13.261
It just was not the list
I was looking for.

25:13.262 --> 25:14.529
[sighs]

25:16.599 --> 25:18.833
[sighs]
Amy, we're friends,
aren't we?

25:18.834 --> 25:21.870
I don't know. I don't know
what being friends
with you means.

25:21.871 --> 25:24.706
That we once
loved each other,

25:24.707 --> 25:26.808
but now
we love other people.

25:26.809 --> 25:30.178
So now we're just friends.
But we are friends.

25:30.179 --> 25:32.180
So, if I ask you,

25:32.181 --> 25:33.982
as a friend,
to make up with Adrian

25:33.983 --> 25:36.017
and just come up
with some girls
to come to the shower,

25:36.018 --> 25:38.653
can't you do that for me,
for old time's sake?

25:38.654 --> 25:41.356
I don't know anyone
to come to the stupid shower.

25:41.357 --> 25:44.292
And after what Adrian did,
I don't even wanna go
to the stupid shower.

25:44.293 --> 25:45.727
All right.

25:45.728 --> 25:47.495
I have a suggestion
for a shower guest.

25:47.496 --> 25:48.997
Maybe you
can just invite her,

25:48.998 --> 25:51.366
and then the list
will grow from there.

25:51.367 --> 25:53.835
Ask Alice.
I did ask Alice.

25:53.836 --> 25:57.505
And she's going
to a cousin's bar mitzvah
on Saturday.

25:57.506 --> 25:59.140
She's Japanese.

25:59.141 --> 26:01.643
I know that. Ben,

26:01.644 --> 26:03.645
since we're friends,

26:03.646 --> 26:05.814
I wanna be honest with you
and tell you something

26:05.815 --> 26:07.882
that your other friends
won't tell you.

26:07.883 --> 26:10.552
You're having a baby
with a girl who got pregnant

26:10.553 --> 26:12.420
because she was trying
to get back
at her old boyfriend.

26:12.421 --> 26:15.623
And you're marrying her
and sharing the rest
of your life with her,

26:15.624 --> 26:18.560
and she's still trying
to get back at her old boyfriend

26:18.561 --> 26:22.530
and all the girls
he ever slept with,
including me.

26:22.531 --> 26:24.833
And that's the truth.

26:24.834 --> 26:27.469
So deal with it.

26:37.646 --> 26:40.315
And just what was your reason
for getting pregnant?

26:42.118 --> 26:43.618
Were you taken advantage of?

26:43.619 --> 26:46.521
Did Ricky take advantage
of you?

26:46.522 --> 26:48.723
Were you sexually stupid?

26:48.724 --> 26:51.326
Did you not know
that having unprotected sex

26:51.327 --> 26:53.795
could result in a pregnancy?

26:53.796 --> 26:55.797
You know,
at least Adrian is willing

26:55.798 --> 26:57.599
to take responsibility
for what happened.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.367
Yeah, even though
it was an accident,

26:59.368 --> 27:01.703
Adrian is willing
to take responsibility.

27:01.704 --> 27:04.405
And Adrian is honest,
even brutally honest.

27:04.406 --> 27:06.407
So I believe her
when she says

27:06.408 --> 27:08.209
that she wasn't out
to get you today.

27:08.210 --> 27:10.745
And I believe her
when she says
that she was embarrassed

27:10.746 --> 27:12.747
because there was no list
of girls to invite.

27:12.748 --> 27:15.116
And I believe her
when she says that she loves me

27:15.117 --> 27:17.886
and wants to be with me
for the rest of our lives.

27:17.887 --> 27:20.688
Do you believe Ricky
when he tells you
that he loves you?

27:20.689 --> 27:23.525
Because Ricky
has told every girl

27:23.526 --> 27:26.628
that he has ever been with
that he loves her.

27:29.532 --> 27:31.533
Do you really love Ricky?

27:31.534 --> 27:33.368
The real Ricky?

27:33.369 --> 27:35.703
The guy who slept
with all those girls?

27:35.704 --> 27:38.506
The guy that every girl
has been with?

27:38.507 --> 27:42.777
Or do you just wanna justify
getting pregnant by him
in the first place?

27:45.648 --> 27:47.282
Get out of this house.

27:47.283 --> 27:50.051
And gladly.

27:51.720 --> 27:53.588
[door opens]

27:54.824 --> 27:56.124
[door closes]

27:56.125 --> 27:58.793
You still want me
to throw a shower for Adrian?

28:07.028 --> 28:09.162
- Oh, boy.
- She's my daughter.

28:09.163 --> 28:11.498
I think he forgets how much
Amy has been through.

28:13.034 --> 28:15.302
I don't know what to say
other than he's my son,

28:15.303 --> 28:17.804
and right now
he's going through a lot.

28:17.805 --> 28:19.339
That's not Amy's fault.

28:20.408 --> 28:21.474
What?

28:21.475 --> 28:24.344
Well, no, it's not
exactly her fault.

28:24.345 --> 28:25.779
"Not exactly"?
What does that mean?

28:25.780 --> 28:27.581
Nothing. It means nothing.

28:27.582 --> 28:30.050
You know I'm under
a lot of pressure here myself,

28:30.051 --> 28:32.052
and I don't wanna say anything
I shouldn't.

28:32.053 --> 28:34.154
So, I'll talk to Ben.

28:34.155 --> 28:36.523
Good. Talk to Ben.

28:36.524 --> 28:39.826
How is it Amy's fault?
How could it possibly
be Amy's fault?

28:39.827 --> 28:42.028
Let's just let
sleeping dogs lie, huh?

28:42.029 --> 28:44.130
Let's not.

28:44.131 --> 28:47.434
George, my 17-year-old son
is having a baby.

28:47.435 --> 28:49.869
He's moving out of my house
and into a condo,

28:49.870 --> 28:51.671
and he's getting married.

28:51.672 --> 28:54.841
And in the midst of all that,
he did something stupid tonight.

28:54.842 --> 28:56.142
I'm sorry.

28:56.143 --> 28:57.777
You don't have to
apologize to me.

28:57.778 --> 28:59.579
He has to apologize to Amy.

28:59.580 --> 29:01.414
And I don't care
what his excuse is.

29:01.415 --> 29:03.683
There is no excuse.
My Amy is a nice girl.

29:03.684 --> 29:04.918
She didn't deserve that.

29:04.919 --> 29:06.586
I'm sure she didn't.

29:06.587 --> 29:08.855
But if there's an excuse,
I'd say that

29:08.856 --> 29:11.625
Ben fell in love with Amy,
and it was the beginning
of the end

29:11.626 --> 29:14.527
of a normal teenage existence
as he knew it.

29:14.528 --> 29:16.529
It took him down
a completely different path

29:16.530 --> 29:20.100
that neither Ben or I
wanted him to go.

29:21.469 --> 29:23.470
And I'm not saying

29:23.471 --> 29:26.773
that him having a baby
and getting married
is Amy's fault,

29:26.774 --> 29:30.243
and I'm not saying that
argument today is Amy's fault.

29:30.244 --> 29:33.246
I'm just saying that the forces
behind that argument today

29:33.247 --> 29:36.316
were set in motion
a long time ago

29:36.317 --> 29:37.517
by Amy.

29:37.518 --> 29:39.586
Well, I don't know anything
about forces

29:39.587 --> 29:42.922
or consequences
or going down paths
or normal teenage existence

29:42.923 --> 29:44.457
or any of
that other gibberish.

29:44.458 --> 29:46.459
All I know is your son
came over to my house tonight

29:46.460 --> 29:48.261
and said some horrible things
to my daughter.

29:48.262 --> 29:50.397
He did.
But from his perspective,

29:50.398 --> 29:52.098
those horrible things are true.

29:52.099 --> 29:53.833
And it's the perspective
of a young man

29:53.834 --> 29:56.536
who got involved with a girl
that was pregnant at 15.

29:59.674 --> 30:01.474
What the hell is going on?

30:01.475 --> 30:04.110
What new conspiracy
against Adrian and me is this?

30:04.111 --> 30:06.479
Dad if you think you're gonna
force an apology from me

30:06.480 --> 30:09.115
for what I said tonight,
you're wrong.

30:09.116 --> 30:10.750
I'll talk to him.

30:12.053 --> 30:13.687
Do that.

30:17.792 --> 30:20.727
[door opens, closes]
[sighs]

30:20.728 --> 30:23.463
Do not put me in a position
to defend you again.

30:23.464 --> 30:25.598
I don't like
having to defend you.

30:25.599 --> 30:27.300
In the process
of defending you,

30:27.301 --> 30:29.169
I said some things
that I now regret.

30:29.170 --> 30:30.870
I rarely do that,
but I did that

30:30.871 --> 30:32.439
because I completely
lost my mind

30:32.440 --> 30:34.307
in trying
to stand up for you,

30:34.308 --> 30:36.810
which is what you're doing
in trying to stand up
for Adrian.

30:36.811 --> 30:39.579
You do not go over
to someone's house
and attack them like that

30:39.580 --> 30:41.781
even if you think
it's the honorable thing to do--

30:41.782 --> 30:43.583
defending your bride.

30:43.584 --> 30:49.823
You escalated a little fight
in the hallway today

30:49.824 --> 30:52.726
And I really don't know how
to stop it at this point.

30:52.727 --> 30:55.061
But it needs to be stopped
as soon as possible.

30:55.062 --> 30:56.863
Stopped or won?

30:56.864 --> 30:58.098
Stopped.

30:59.433 --> 31:02.535
Yo, hey, what's up?
You wanted to talk to me?

31:02.536 --> 31:03.670
[sighs]

31:03.671 --> 31:05.071
[sighs]

31:05.072 --> 31:07.073
You mind?

31:07.074 --> 31:08.875
Good night, Alice, Henry.

31:08.876 --> 31:11.578
Good night.
Good night.

31:11.579 --> 31:14.147
The King
doth looked P.O.'d.

31:14.148 --> 31:16.216
Yes, he doth.

31:17.284 --> 31:19.219
So does the prince.

31:19.220 --> 31:22.722
You have a bar mitzvah
to go to this Saturday?

31:22.723 --> 31:24.958
[chuckles]

31:24.959 --> 31:26.459
Alice?
Uh-oh.

31:26.460 --> 31:27.761
Look,

31:27.762 --> 31:29.796
if you don't wanna
be friends with Adrian,

31:29.797 --> 31:31.898
then you don't
wanna be friends with me.

31:31.899 --> 31:33.133
Oh, no.

31:33.134 --> 31:35.368
I wanna be friends
with Adrian.

31:35.369 --> 31:37.036
I just don't wanna
go to a shower.

31:37.037 --> 31:39.405
You two are my only friends,
and I don't wanna sit around

31:39.406 --> 31:41.841
with Amy and Adrian and Grace
and play shower games.

31:41.842 --> 31:43.643
And why would you?

31:43.644 --> 31:46.279
I mean, you've only been
coming over to my house

31:46.280 --> 31:48.715
for, what,
almost ten years now?

31:48.716 --> 31:50.517
Eating our food

31:50.518 --> 31:52.585
and being driven
by our chauffeur.

31:52.586 --> 31:56.222
Sleeping in my room
and playing in our game room.

31:56.223 --> 31:58.792
Watching movies
in our screening room,

31:58.793 --> 32:01.427
and going to sports events
and concerts

32:01.428 --> 32:03.830
and restaurants
all at my family's expense.

32:03.831 --> 32:06.666
Why would you wanna do me
the very small favor

32:06.667 --> 32:09.469
of getting a little gift
for my soon-to-be wife's shower?

32:09.470 --> 32:12.739
My soon-to-be wife
and mother
of my daughter's shower?

32:12.740 --> 32:15.942
That's a bit harsh,
isn't it?

32:15.943 --> 32:18.912
I'm sorry.
It's not that I don't love you.

32:18.913 --> 32:20.446
I love you, Ben.

32:20.447 --> 32:23.683
It's just that I don't wanna be
part of all this.

32:23.684 --> 32:25.952
I don't really think
you should be getting married.

32:25.953 --> 32:27.187
Oh, God.

32:27.188 --> 32:30.390
What do you think, Henry?

32:30.391 --> 32:32.392
I think that neither of you
can take back

32:32.393 --> 32:34.260
what you just said
to each other,

32:34.261 --> 32:35.929
and so I'll just say
I love you both,

32:35.930 --> 32:39.365
and I apologize to each of you
for what the other said.

32:39.366 --> 32:41.267
And I wish you love, peace,

32:41.268 --> 32:45.271
<i>and Soul Train!</i>

32:46.941 --> 32:48.608
Just trying to use humor

32:48.609 --> 32:50.844
to keep our friendship
from falling into a black hole.

32:50.845 --> 32:52.212
Too late.

32:57.618 --> 33:01.287
That's not what we broke up
over-- whether or not
you would have sex with me.

33:01.288 --> 33:04.958
Yes, it was.
It was why you wouldn't

33:04.959 --> 33:07.193
Because you thought I'd had sex
with that girl you hated.

33:07.194 --> 33:08.795
What girl I hated?

33:08.796 --> 33:10.930
Karen.
Who?

33:10.931 --> 33:13.433
Karen Corcoran.

33:13.434 --> 33:15.735
Oh, come on.
She made lunch for me one day.

33:15.736 --> 33:17.604
That was the end of it
for you and me.

33:17.605 --> 33:19.472
Oh, yeah. Ham sandwich
and a bag of chips.

33:19.473 --> 33:22.075
Oh, yeah.
Now it's coming back to me.

33:22.076 --> 33:24.077
You did not forget that.
Come on.

33:24.078 --> 33:25.645
[laughs]
No, I did.

33:25.646 --> 33:28.281
Wait. I beat her out
for position
on the cheerleading squad,

33:28.282 --> 33:30.116
so she went after you
to get back at me.

33:30.117 --> 33:32.218
I never did anything
with that girl.

33:32.219 --> 33:35.355
Okay, but you wanted to,
and she wanted to.

33:35.356 --> 33:37.657
That'why she made you
a ham sandwich.

33:37.658 --> 33:39.592
We were having
a perfectly nice evening.

33:39.593 --> 33:41.361
Why'd you have to go
and bring that up for?

33:41.362 --> 33:43.463
It was high school.

33:44.498 --> 33:45.865
Oh, come on.
It was nothing.

33:45.866 --> 33:47.934
Okay. Well,
maybe it's nothing,

33:47.935 --> 33:50.370
but because of that,
we both ended up marrying
other people.

33:50.371 --> 33:52.205
Because of a ham sandwich?

33:52.206 --> 33:54.274
Yep.

33:54.275 --> 33:56.276
High school stinks.

33:56.277 --> 33:58.077
We're not
in high school anymore.

33:58.078 --> 34:00.280
The whole world's
a high school.

34:08.656 --> 34:11.123
This shower has gotten
completely out of hand.

34:11.125 --> 34:13.126
[chuckles]
Yeah.

34:13.127 --> 34:16.795
It's funny
how one little argument
can destroy an entire universe.

34:16.797 --> 34:18.464
Yeah.

34:18.465 --> 34:21.067
Do you remember
why we broke up?

34:21.068 --> 34:24.370
Uh, yeah.
You cheated on me.

34:24.371 --> 34:27.373
Yeah, but it was more
than that, really.

34:27.373 --> 34:29.342
No, that was it.

34:30.577 --> 34:33.212
No, you didn't wanna go
to couples counseling

34:33.213 --> 34:34.714
because the counselor
was a woman.

34:34.715 --> 34:37.083
And I felt that I needed
a woman on my side.

34:37.083 --> 34:38.650
I thought that a woman
could explain

34:38.652 --> 34:40.652
why a woman would cheat
on her husband

34:40.654 --> 34:42.889
and, well,
make it sound good.

34:42.889 --> 34:45.291
But you wouldn't go.

34:45.292 --> 34:47.260
No. And you know what?

34:47.261 --> 34:49.929
I still don't think a marriage
can be saved through counseling.

34:49.929 --> 34:51.563
And now I've got
the experience to prove it.

34:51.565 --> 34:53.266
Yeah, well,
the marriage counselor

34:53.266 --> 34:54.967
really couldn't have made it
sound good,

34:54.969 --> 34:57.570
because I was just angry

34:57.571 --> 34:59.372
on a really deep level.

34:59.373 --> 35:01.941
I-- I'd gotten married
way too early,

35:01.942 --> 35:04.510
and I didn't really
wanna be married.

35:04.511 --> 35:07.246
I just wanted to have sex.
[laughs]

35:07.247 --> 35:09.849
Oh, wanted
to be close to someone,

35:09.850 --> 35:13.453
and I wanted someone
to love me.

35:14.822 --> 35:16.756
I loved you.

35:18.225 --> 35:21.694
You used to leave your socks
on the floor.

35:21.695 --> 35:24.864
I had told you
that was driving me crazy--
your socks on the floor.

35:24.865 --> 35:27.700
I felt like I was always
picking up your dirty socks.

35:27.701 --> 35:30.069
I like to just
step out of them.

35:30.070 --> 35:31.671
I still do.

35:31.672 --> 35:33.639
I stand on the toe of one sock,
and I pull my foot out,

35:33.640 --> 35:35.942
and then I stand on the toe
of the other sock,
and I pull my foot out.

35:35.943 --> 35:37.810
I've been doing it
since I was a kid.

35:37.811 --> 35:39.946
It's like setting
my feet free.

35:39.947 --> 35:41.881
I love the feeling.

35:41.882 --> 35:44.283
Well, I never told you
that I threw away

35:44.284 --> 35:46.285
every sock that you left
on the floor

35:46.286 --> 35:48.388
until you were almost
out of socks.

35:48.389 --> 35:51.324
And then when you were down
to your last pair,

35:51.325 --> 35:53.659
I-- I-- I got scared,
and I went out,

35:53.660 --> 35:57.430
and, um, bought you
some new socks.

35:57.431 --> 35:59.232
[chuckles]
So what are you saying?

35:59.233 --> 36:00.900
The guy you cheated with
was a sock salesman?

36:02.302 --> 36:04.604
The guy sold socks?

36:04.605 --> 36:07.240
Well, he owned
the sock company.

36:07.241 --> 36:10.209
He just happened
to be in the store.

36:10.210 --> 36:13.212
So you did it with him
because my socks
were on the floor?

36:13.213 --> 36:16.582
Your socks were on the floor
every day for a couple years,
George,

36:16.583 --> 36:19.052
and it went to a bad place
inside me--

36:19.053 --> 36:20.853
picking up those socks.

36:20.854 --> 36:23.456
I just-- I felt like
I was your servant.

36:23.457 --> 36:26.025
And I had had it
drilled into me

36:26.026 --> 36:27.527
all my life
by my own mother

36:27.528 --> 36:29.295
that women
are the servants of man,

36:29.296 --> 36:32.131
and I just didn't like it.

36:32.132 --> 36:35.735
I didn't like picking up
those socks, George.

36:35.736 --> 36:37.970
[sighs]
I hated it.

36:41.642 --> 36:45.478
[chuckles]
What was it
that you said earlier?

36:45.479 --> 36:47.480
"It's funny
how one little argument

36:47.481 --> 36:50.416
can destroy
the entire universe."

36:51.452 --> 36:52.985
[door closes]

36:58.459 --> 37:00.593
It was just socks.

37:03.794 --> 37:04.160
[beeping]
Grace, I'm telling you,
he f

37:04.195 --> 37:07.430
he feels really bad.

37:07.465 --> 37:09.065
Just go down there
and talk to him.

37:09.100 --> 37:11.167
No. If he felt really bad,
he'd come up here.

37:11.202 --> 37:13.470
You know he didn't mean it.
Well, then he shouldn't
have said it.

37:13.504 --> 37:15.472
Grace--
What?

37:15.506 --> 37:17.407
Do you mind?
I'm trying to text Grant.

37:17.441 --> 37:19.175
Will you just forget
about Grant for two seconds?

37:19.210 --> 37:21.244
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

37:21.278 --> 37:24.013
What is wrong with you?
I'll tell you
what's wrong with me.

37:24.048 --> 37:26.049
My day started off badly,
and it's only gotten worse.

37:26.083 --> 37:29.152
I cannot believe
this fight with Adrian
has escalated into this--

37:29.186 --> 37:31.254
into my not being able
to see Grant.

37:31.288 --> 37:33.022
And how are you blaming that
on Adrian?

37:33.057 --> 37:35.091
Who am I supposed
to blame it on? Me?

37:35.126 --> 37:38.294
It's not my fault Adrian
doesn't have any friends
to invite to her shower.

37:38.329 --> 37:40.263
As her one and only friend,

37:40.297 --> 37:42.098
surely you know this
about Adrian:

37:42.133 --> 37:44.033
She doesn't have any friends.
Well, as usual,

37:44.068 --> 37:46.169
that sounds like something
Madison would say.

37:46.203 --> 37:48.171
Did you say that
or did Madison say that?

37:48.205 --> 37:50.006
I haven't even spoken
to Madison tonight

37:50.040 --> 37:51.508
'cause I've been too busy
talking to Tom

37:51.542 --> 37:53.443
as if I don't have
two tests tomorrow.

37:53.477 --> 37:55.345
Why don't you just admit
that the fight in the hallway

37:55.379 --> 37:58.181
was as much your fault
as anyone else's?
[scoffs]

37:58.215 --> 38:00.216
I don't think you wanna
throw a shower for Adrian,

38:00.251 --> 38:02.318
because if you did,
you would've come up with
a list of girls to invite.

38:02.353 --> 38:05.021
That wasn't my job.
That was Amy's job.

38:06.390 --> 38:08.324
I made the invitations.

38:08.359 --> 38:10.293
And that fight in the hallway
was Adrian's way

38:10.327 --> 38:12.228
of trying to show Amy
how many girls Ricky
had slept with.

38:12.263 --> 38:13.930
It has nothing to do with me.
You say you're friends

38:13.964 --> 38:15.832
with Adrian,
but I don't think you are.

38:15.866 --> 38:17.767
I don't think you've ever
really gotten over the fact

38:17.802 --> 38:19.869
that she and I had sex
when you wouldt
have sex with me.

38:19.904 --> 38:23.573
And are we talking
about oral sex or sex sex?

38:23.607 --> 38:26.409
Face it, Jack.
Our relationship was never
gonna work out

38:26.443 --> 38:28.511
after you two did
whatever you two did.

38:28.546 --> 38:30.380
And yet
you had sex with me.

38:30.414 --> 38:32.282
I wish I hadn't
had sex with you.

38:32.316 --> 38:34.417
And which was it,
oral sex or sex sex?

38:34.451 --> 38:37.053
Why? You still care
about me?

38:38.823 --> 38:41.791
Your mom said I could
talk to you for two minutes.

38:41.826 --> 38:43.560
You know what?
Two minutes would be too long.

38:45.129 --> 38:46.563
Good night.

38:51.602 --> 38:53.369
I really hate you.

38:53.404 --> 38:56.172
[chuckles]
I really don't believe that.

38:57.575 --> 39:00.176
You weren't even gonna
invite me to Adrian's shower?

39:00.211 --> 39:02.312
It wasn't my place
to invite anyone, okay?

39:02.346 --> 39:04.380
Yes, it was.
Adrian and Grace

39:04.415 --> 39:06.316
made the invitation list
to your shower.

39:06.350 --> 39:08.318
Did they?

39:08.352 --> 39:10.987
Oh, yeah, maybe they did.
That's why the neighbors
were there.

39:11.021 --> 39:12.789
Yeah, that's why
the neighbors were there.

39:12.823 --> 39:14.891
And this is why
you're a complete ass.

39:14.925 --> 39:16.492
Okay, Ashley.

39:16.527 --> 39:18.528
I have heard enough bad things
said about me tonight.

39:18.562 --> 39:21.097
From just one person,
or a lot of different people?

39:21.131 --> 39:22.498
Just one. Ben.

39:22.533 --> 39:25.268
Ben came over here
and told me off earlier,

39:25.302 --> 39:27.403
and I'm really
not quite over it.

39:27.438 --> 39:30.607
So I don't need you
to make me feel badly
about anything more, okay?

39:30.641 --> 39:32.575
Is that what's making you
feel badly?

39:32.610 --> 39:35.111
Or are you still
feeling badly from seeing
all of Ricky's lovers?

39:35.145 --> 39:37.313
Old lovers.
You hope they're old lovers.

39:37.348 --> 39:41.084
I know they're old lovers,
and I know they don't
mean anything to him.

39:41.118 --> 39:44.354
Just like Ben doesn't mean
anything to you, so why should
you care what he said?

39:44.388 --> 39:47.390
He practically accused me
of pretending
to be in love with Ricky

39:47.424 --> 39:50.159
just so I could justify
having slept with him
in the first place.

39:50.194 --> 39:51.361
Uh-huh. And?

39:51.395 --> 39:53.329
And that's not true.

39:53.364 --> 39:55.031
I was attracted to Ricky
at band camp,

39:55.065 --> 39:57.300
and then I hated Ricky
for what happened at band camp,

39:57.334 --> 39:58.935
and then I fell in love
with Ricky.

39:58.969 --> 40:00.169
I love him.

40:00.204 --> 40:01.638
The Ricky in your imagination,

40:01.672 --> 40:04.040
or the real Ricky
who sleeps with everyone?

40:04.074 --> 40:05.208
Not everyone.

40:06.143 --> 40:07.543
Not you.

40:14.018 --> 40:17.220
You know, I called Adrian
a few minutes ago

40:17.254 --> 40:19.455
to find out her side
of the story,

40:19.490 --> 40:22.258
and she said she was
on the other line with Ricky

40:22.293 --> 40:23.626
and she'd have to
call me back.

40:23.661 --> 40:26.930
And you wanted to come
and tell on Ricky because?

40:26.964 --> 40:29.999
Because you blame me
for kissing Ricky,

40:30.034 --> 40:32.101
and that's because
you don't think

40:32.136 --> 40:34.370
he could ever seriously
be attracted to me.

40:35.906 --> 40:39.409
And that hasn't made me
feel so good...for months.

40:40.911 --> 40:43.079
So I took this opportunity
to tell you.

40:43.113 --> 40:45.515
Yeah.

40:45.549 --> 40:48.885
You can't possibly see that kiss
for what it really was--

40:48.919 --> 40:51.821
a complete
and total betrayal.

40:51.855 --> 40:53.823
You really didn't care
if you completely destroyed

40:53.857 --> 40:55.959
my relationship with Ricky
just to have a little fun.

40:55.993 --> 40:59.262
And you didn't really care
if you completely destroyed
this family

40:59.296 --> 41:01.097
just to have
a little fun at band camp.

41:05.402 --> 41:07.337
[sighs]

41:09.006 --> 41:10.940
Ben told you
not to talk to me.

41:10.975 --> 41:12.942
He did.
But you know what, Adrian?

41:12.977 --> 41:14.944
As close as you and Ben are,
you and me--

41:14.979 --> 41:17.113
we've known each other
a lot longer than you and Ben.

41:17.147 --> 41:19.415
<i>And you and me--
we understand each other.</i>

41:19.450 --> 41:21.818
Yeah, I guess.
So what do you want?

41:21.852 --> 41:24.287
I just wanna talk.
So talk.

41:24.321 --> 41:26.656
Did you really not know
what you were doing

41:26.690 --> 41:28.624
<i>when you were calling
all those girls over
in the hallway?</i>

41:28.659 --> 41:30.026
<i>Did you not know</i>

41:30.060 --> 41:32.028
that that would be
hurtful to Amy

41:32.062 --> 41:34.297
to have to look at
a bunch of girls
that I had sex with?

41:34.331 --> 41:35.965
What, you think
I called them all last night

41:36.000 --> 41:37.867
and told them
to be out there this morning?

41:37.901 --> 41:39.836
No. It just happened.

41:39.870 --> 41:42.105
I mean, let's face it.
You've been around.

41:42.139 --> 41:44.340
Know what I'm talking about?
Yes, I know what
you're talking about.

41:44.375 --> 41:45.942
So were you just
trying to hurt me?

41:45.976 --> 41:48.111
I wasn't trying to hurt
anyone, okay?

41:48.145 --> 41:50.046
I just want a shower.

41:50.080 --> 41:52.348
I've never really had a party
because girls don't like me.

41:52.383 --> 41:55.852
And I want a party.
Do you know why
girls don't like you?

41:55.886 --> 41:57.854
It doesn't matter.
I just know that they don't.

41:57.888 --> 41:59.789
Because they don't,

41:59.823 --> 42:03.026
I feel kind of like
I'm less than other people.

42:03.060 --> 42:05.028
But, Adrian, maybe girls
would like you

42:05.062 --> 42:07.096
if you were nicer to them.
Yeah, I know.

42:07.131 --> 42:09.298
<i>But I never get a chance
to be nice to them.</i>

42:09.333 --> 42:11.267
<i>I don't have anyone
to be nice to except for Ben.</i>

42:11.301 --> 42:14.203
And I am really nice to Ben.

42:14.238 --> 42:17.874
Yeah, he's let everyone know,
believe me.

42:17.908 --> 42:19.542
Come on, Adrian.

42:19.576 --> 42:21.911
I know that all this stuff
goes back to your feeling

42:21.945 --> 42:24.447
like all the kids
in elementary school
made fun of you

42:24.481 --> 42:27.283
because you didn't have
nice clothes and all that.

42:27.317 --> 42:29.352
<i>But it's not elementary school,</i>

42:29.386 --> 42:30.887
and you have to be
a grown-up now.

42:30.921 --> 42:32.488
You gotta get over
your insecurities.

42:32.523 --> 42:34.924
But I am.
No. No, you're not.

42:34.958 --> 42:38.961
Just marrying Ben
is not gonna get you
over your insecurities.

42:38.996 --> 42:40.730
It may just make you
feel more insecure.

42:40.764 --> 42:43.299
<i>What do you mean?
Nothing.</i>

42:43.333 --> 42:46.836
Could you just go over
and talk to Amy
before anyone gets hurt?

42:46.870 --> 42:49.105
You know,
I think Amy doesn't want

42:49.139 --> 42:51.240
any more company tonight.

42:51.275 --> 42:53.342
I think I'll let her get over
her last company.

42:53.377 --> 42:54.877
Know what I mean?

42:54.912 --> 42:57.113
No, I don't know
what you mean.

42:57.147 --> 43:00.383
What do you mean.
You don't mean
Ben was over there?

43:01.585 --> 43:02.785
Adrian!

43:04.221 --> 43:06.456
Ben really
should've let you

43:06.490 --> 43:08.257
talk to me at school today.

43:08.292 --> 43:10.059
[sighs]
