MAN IN LOVE

02:03.883 --> 02:05.815
Oh Lord,

02:05.816 --> 02:11.590
despite all the hardships of life,
in our days of bad economy,

02:12.417 --> 02:16.782
Your flock is grateful to you,

02:16.783 --> 02:21.228
and we will continue to give
our offerings to You.

02:21.450 --> 02:25.121
Your business is booming,
why do you need a loan?

02:25.417 --> 02:28.860
A large congregation
doesn't equal big money.

02:29.616 --> 02:34.015
And this ain't no business!
It's a holy place of worship.

02:34.016 --> 02:35.960
Like hell...

02:37.350 --> 02:41.725
This loan isn't
authorized by the office.

02:42.683 --> 02:45.355
It's a private loan
from me, here.

02:49.816 --> 02:51.055
<i>Thanks, Tae-il</i>

02:51.549 --> 02:54.482
I seriously will pray for you.

02:54.483 --> 02:58.015
Forget it, pray for yourself,

02:58.016 --> 02:59.960
to quit gambling.

03:00.583 --> 03:02.255
I pray everyday!

03:03.150 --> 03:05.753
You'll go to hell
at this rate.

Mr. HAN!
Let's win for our Lord!

03:10.050 --> 03:11.550
Whatever, man.

03:15.183 --> 03:19.416
Because of redevelopment,
all the neighbors fled,

03:19.417 --> 03:23.449
my kids' education fee's rising,
I don't know what to do!

03:23.450 --> 03:25.223
Goddammit!

03:25.616 --> 03:28.416
Why always the gloom?!
How many weeks has it been?

03:28.417 --> 03:32.249
Everyone has a sob story,
shall I end things here?!

03:32.250 --> 03:34.955
- Mr. HAN!
- Shut it!

03:39.950 --> 03:42.553
Wait, that's gasoline!

03:43.849 --> 03:47.225
Fuck this life,
let's just die together.

03:47.916 --> 03:51.015
Mr. HAN! What's with you?!
Don't drink that!

03:51.016 --> 03:53.994
Let go!
Back the fuck off!

03:55.083 --> 03:57.459
My gosh...
Please don't ..

04:00.417 --> 04:00.815
Drink.

04:00.816 --> 04:02.782
- Please, Mr. HAN.
- Drink it!

04:02.783 --> 04:04.182
- I'm sorry!
- Just drink it!

04:04.183 --> 04:06.316
- It's all my fault!
- Drink it, dammit!

04:06.317 --> 04:08.022
Mr. HAN! Please stop!

04:08.116 --> 04:11.525
Wait, please...

04:12.216 --> 04:13.489
It's all my fault...

04:13.816 --> 04:17.149
It's my shop rent
and kids' tuition.

04:17.150 --> 04:23.117
I'll get the rest somehow,
I'm so sorry.

04:27.083 --> 04:29.959

Gotta educate them!

04:48.016 --> 04:49.925
Shut it!

04:50.083 --> 04:51.356
So fucking loud!

05:08.283 --> 05:09.624
I'm back, shithead!

05:32.317 --> 05:33.658
Afternoon.

05:37.783 --> 05:38.817
Yeah, speak

05:39.250 --> 05:40.659
40 a piece.

05:42.016 --> 05:46.051
Fuckwad, why is it so hard
getting a seal?!

05:46.116 --> 05:47.182
It's from the market.

05:47.183 --> 05:48.815
Come back?!

05:48.816 --> 05:50.294

at least pretend to listen.

06:04.549 --> 06:05.915
Good?

06:05.916 --> 06:06.689
Yeah.

- Yes.

06:54.483 --> 06:59.325
Mister, please get up.
Could you wake up?

07:02.383 --> 07:04.156
Missy, can we talk?

07:06.016 --> 07:09.516
If you don't feel chatty,
take a look at this.

07:11.549 --> 07:12.993
Isn't this illegal?

07:13.417 --> 07:17.416
Illegal? Is that why
he took a loan from us?

07:17.417 --> 07:19.792
Be quiet,
we're in a hospital

07:20.283 --> 07:22.420
I'll need to
talk to him directly.

07:23.250 --> 07:25.250
- Bring him outside.
- Yes, sir.

07:25.950 --> 07:27.349
- Out of the way.
- What are you doing?!

07:27.350 --> 07:29.815
- Fuck off!
- Don't touch him!

07:29.816 --> 07:30.416
- Fucking bitch!
- Get out!

No, mom said to
drag you home

20:06.250 --> 20:07.625
Drag me.

20:09.516 --> 20:12.551
- Mom, I'm home.
- Hey.

20:14.749 --> 20:15.682
Have dinner

20:15.683 --> 20:18.718
Shit, fix the damn light!

20:20.883 --> 20:23.848
That bastard,
it's like we don't exist.

20:23.849 --> 20:26.548
Moron, have dinner!

20:26.549 --> 20:28.049
He doesn't wanna eat?

20:28.050 --> 20:30.249
Dunno, he's busy with business.

20:30.250 --> 20:32.557
Business of breaking laws?

20:32.916 --> 20:35.615
You're single-handedly
tainting our family name!

20:35.616 --> 20:37.548
Heard you went to the station!

20:37.549 --> 20:39.316
Dad, shut up!

20:39.317 --> 20:42.215
Shut up?! How could you
say that to your father?!

20:42.216 --> 20:44.625
- Let's just eat!
- I am eating!

20:44.916 --> 20:46.552
Just eat!

20:48.250 --> 20:50.557
He's nothing but trouble, dad.

20:51.883 --> 20:54.554
You're no better,
act your age.

20:56.016 --> 20:58.721
Father, we' re sorry.

21:00.450 --> 21:01.984
<i>Private Loan Contract</i>

21:15.183 --> 21:19.558

21:31.150 --> 21:33.923
<i>I'm sorry,
it's the hospital rule.</i>

21:38.849 --> 21:40.020
Did you eat?

21:41.183 --> 21:44.457
Chicken's the best snack,
let's talk.

21:49.950 --> 21:50.984
Look here

21:52.816 --> 21:55.294
This is the contract you signed.

21:58.317 --> 22:02.727
And this memo voids
this contract.

22:04.683 --> 22:06.184
See these boxes?

22:06.549 --> 22:11.392
For every hour we meet once a day,
I'll color these boxes.

22:11.749 --> 22:15.250
When it's all filled in,
this becomes yours

22:15.849 --> 22:17.350
Do you understand?

22:20.417 --> 22:22.553
Leave if you're done

22:30.150 --> 22:31.492
Think it over
and call me.

22:32.616 --> 22:34.060
Gall regardless.

22:43.683 --> 22:48.957
<i>Daesan Industries

22:51.516 --> 22:53.392
So what do I have to do?

22:55.683 --> 22:57.059
What are the conditions?

22:58.116 --> 22:59.093
Condition?

22:59.916 --> 23:02.951
That's...

23:03.950 --> 23:05.360
What do you think?

23:08.317 --> 23:12.249
We take... walks...

23:12.250 --> 23:14.523
Walk? Then what?

23:15.150 --> 23:17.253
And have chats...

23:18.883 --> 23:21.182
Yo, how old are you?

23:21.183 --> 23:23.249
We're not senile seniors.

23:23.250 --> 23:26.716
Does it make sense to deduct
the interest for chitchats?

23:27.883 --> 23:29.384
Forget it.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.388
Wait...

23:39.116 --> 23:41.390
Dammit...

23:43.050 --> 23:44.221
Not washing up?

23:45.383 --> 23:46.587
Give me a light

23:54.383 --> 23:56.582
- Yo!
- What?

23:56.583 --> 23:58.615
Do you love me?

23:58.616 --> 24:02.115
Love? Can't you see
I'm working?

24:02.116 --> 24:05.082
If you don't,
how can you just strip?

24:05.083 --> 24:06.890
And you do this for love?

24:10.150 --> 24:12.718
What's with you?
Something wrong?

24:13.050 --> 24:15.050
Wash up,
I gotta leave soon.

24:17.383 --> 24:18.258
I'm off.

24:18.783 --> 24:21.159
What a waste of a shower!

24:21.216 --> 24:22.784
Let me ask you one thing.

24:23.883 --> 24:27.115
If I keep thinking about you
isn't that love?

24:27.116 --> 24:30.349
You think about me?
Just don't.

24:30.350 --> 24:33.226
- I don't think of you.
- Shut your hole.

24:33.317 --> 24:35.090
Does today still count?

24:50.583 --> 24:51.788
Let's try again.

24:58.283 --> 25:00.988
- Walk
- And?

25:01.250 --> 25:03.353
Have meals
and drink sometimes.

25:04.350 --> 25:06.191
And some other stuff too

25:07.716 --> 25:09.456
What could that be?

25:16.583 --> 25:17.617
Mister.

25:18.883 --> 25:20.259
Do you like me?

25:21.383 --> 25:23.792
Or is this a new way
of threatening?

25:29.083 --> 25:33.289
Anyways, keep your promise.

25:36.216 --> 25:37.353
I'm off.

26:16.916 --> 26:20.417

I'll draw you rainbows.

What brings you here so early?

26:34.050 --> 26:35.449
Had Breakfast?

26:35.450 --> 26:36.688
Nah

26:36.749 --> 26:39.782
I ordered some noodles,
have that.

26:39.783 --> 26:40.482
I'm busy.

26:40.483 --> 26:42.949
But you still gotta eat

26:42.950 --> 26:47.519
I'll give you this chicken,
take it with you.

26:47.583 --> 26:50.027
- Good work, I'm off.
- Take this with you!

26:56.883 --> 27:00.149
- I didn't order...
- See you.

27:00.150 --> 27:01.355
Ma'am...

27:10.317 --> 27:12.748
Well, this is new.

27:12.749 --> 27:14.615
Look here

27:14.616 --> 27:16.117
How is it? Nice?

27:18.549 --> 27:22.082
You got a nice face,

27:22.083 --> 27:25.515
but the thing is...
your style is...

27:25.516 --> 27:27.926
menacing?

27:28.183 --> 27:30.615
<i>Hostile... or something...</i>

27:30.616 --> 27:33.288
I'm trying to say,

And you?!

27:52.317 --> 27:53.953
Aren't you coming?

28:17.317 --> 28:18.555
Flip the other way.

28:20.317 --> 28:25.352
You still got it,
good for a son or two.

28:52.150 --> 28:54.787
Stamp your seal
or thumbprint.

28:57.516 --> 28:58.858

29:43.050 --> 29:45.748
Listen to yourself,
out the bullshit.

29:45.749 --> 29:49.284

a million bucks.

29:57.417 --> 29:58.326
Yeah.

29:59.516 --> 30:02.756
Yeah, not the front one,
the back one.

30:44.916 --> 30:47.190
Ask him!
We have a deal!

30:47.383 --> 30:49.418
Fuck off!

30:51.116 --> 30:52.321
Please stop!

30:53.916 --> 30:55.482

Goddammit!
Get Mr. HAN down here!

31:03.883 --> 31:05.259
Fuck!

31:07.083 --> 31:08.615
- Mr. HAN, buddy!
- Stay back.

31:08.616 --> 31:09.548
You gave me a week!

31:09.549 --> 31:11.915
Stay back, go inside.

31:11.916 --> 31:13.249
- Wait.
- Go inside.

31:13.250 --> 31:16.853
- This is wrong!
- I said go inside!

31:18.716 --> 31:20.149
Go inside!

31:20.150 --> 31:21.287
Now!

31:21.950 --> 31:24.258
Go away!

take care of the market!

31:36.849 --> 31:39.548
Is that how you're
taking care of the biz?

31:39.549 --> 31:40.982
Then you shoulda said so!

31:40.983 --> 31:44.052
Is your sweet 'I 6
coming up?

act like...

31:48.549 --> 31:50.084
Goddammit!

31:53.783 --> 31:55.761
I'll take care of it.

32:02.983 --> 32:06.018
Fine, do it your way.

32:17.250 --> 32:21.217
Your boyfriend...
took the patient to the roof.

32:24.050 --> 32:27.358
The protege of Pegasus

32:27.549 --> 32:31.494

you're pathetic...

32:33.250 --> 32:34.250
Hey

32:35.417 --> 32:37.258
I like this the best.

32:37.683 --> 32:39.320
What are you doing?

32:39.450 --> 32:41.249
Reading to him,
so he doesn't get bored.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.194
Did I ask you to do this?!

32:45.883 --> 32:46.826
Hey!

32:47.649 --> 32:48.820
Dammit!

32:51.083 --> 32:52.060
Hey!

32:52.383 --> 32:53.326

32:53.683 --> 32:57.423

or call me either.

33:07.250 --> 33:08.522

33:09.050 --> 33:11.949
Is this a joke?

33:11.950 --> 33:13.682
Is this fun to you?

33:13.683 --> 33:15.815
What about you then?

33:15.816 --> 33:17.982
Why are you
doing this to me?

33:17.983 --> 33:19.892
Tell me why!

34:18.549 --> 34:20.549
Are your nuts?!

34:22.816 --> 34:24.260
What now?

34:27.417 --> 34:28.451
I love you.

Can't you see I'm working?

34:30.716 --> 34:34.049

34:34.050 --> 34:35.382

34:35.383 --> 34:37.327
Fuck! I said I love you!

34:38.883 --> 34:40.918

to ignore me.

34:41.183 --> 34:44.717
It was so hard finding that comic!

34:45.183 --> 34:47.515
I searched so many
comic book shops.

34:47.516 --> 34:51.461
What? Comics?
You're fucking nuts!

34:54.916 --> 34:56.451
Let's go!

34:58.983 --> 35:05.121
Do you feel nothing
when I pour my heart out?

35:05.583 --> 35:08.789
Do you know what love is?

35:09.583 --> 35:11.357
At least this isn't it.

35:11.883 --> 35:15.157
I'll pay the interest,
so don't call me anymore.

35:27.649 --> 35:30.991

Nothing, sir.

Are you nuts?!
Stop that!

42:44.916 --> 42:46.587
Just stay still.

42:48.183 --> 42:50.683
You smell nice.

42:50.849 --> 42:53.293
New perfume?
It smells so new

45:05.983 --> 45:07.188
What the hell?

45:08.649 --> 45:10.093
Isn't this HAN Tae-il?

45:10.583 --> 45:12.289
When did he get here?

45:12.516 --> 45:14.051
He came last night

45:14.516 --> 45:16.858
Hey! Wake up!

45:20.383 --> 45:21.417
Morning.

45:21.783 --> 45:22.954
How did you get out?

45:34.317 --> 45:35.589
What's wrong with your bro?

45:35.716 --> 45:38.887
Should've told you
where he was moving to.

45:42.383 --> 45:46.884
Finish your meal,
and sign here and here.

45:48.116 --> 45:50.151
Finish your meal,
no rush.

45:51.383 --> 45:54.486
<i>HAN Tae-il</i>

45:59.583 --> 46:02.823
<i>Gunsan Police Station.</i>

46:04.250 --> 46:05.921
His new address.

46:07.417 --> 46:09.724
You might not be the reason
for the move.

46:10.816 --> 46:12.385
- Thank you.
- Go on.

46:15.317 --> 46:16.090
Sir!

46:17.649 --> 46:19.957
I was a model prisoner

46:38.883 --> 46:40.452
Mom, I'm not a kid anymore

46:40.549 --> 46:42.682
Our family has trust issue!

46:42.683 --> 46:43.717
Song

46:48.250 --> 46:49.625
Uncle!

46:53.183 --> 46:55.683
Look at this,
isn't the uniform pretty?

46:55.783 --> 46:57.556
So different from middle school.

46:57.683 --> 47:00.854
Our baby's all grown up,
you're a woman now.

47:01.250 --> 47:02.727
When did you get out?

47:03.649 --> 47:05.991
Don't you have 1 more year?

47:06.083 --> 47:09.822
You neglected chores
to count down his sentence?

47:12.383 --> 47:15.054
If you moved,
you should've let me know

47:15.150 --> 47:19.424
You sound like we purposely
moved because of you

47:20.283 --> 47:22.521
Why were you at the station?

47:22.883 --> 47:24.249
What did you do?

47:24.250 --> 47:28.388
Stop it already!
Get down and eat.

47:28.649 --> 47:30.355
I'll eat,
but not his bullshit!

47:56.250 --> 47:59.615
How did you get out?
Did you escape?

47:59.616 --> 48:02.458
I was released
as a model prisoner!

48:05.150 --> 48:07.718
So full of shit...

48:10.683 --> 48:13.015
You were a model
human being in jail?

48:13.016 --> 48:15.149
Expect me to believe that?!

48:15.150 --> 48:17.627
Sir, show me your ID.

48:19.283 --> 48:20.158
Wait.

48:21.783 --> 48:24.590
We're having a chat as a family,
why do you want his ID?

48:25.216 --> 48:28.285
Were you listening in illegally?!

48:28.549 --> 48:31.482
He... was released
as a model prisoner!

48:31.483 --> 48:32.789
Sit down!

48:37.216 --> 48:38.159
Your ID.

48:42.083 --> 48:43.924
Dammit...

48:58.083 --> 48:59.288
You're good.

49:03.050 --> 49:04.515
So fast for an old man.

49:04.516 --> 49:06.249
- Father!
- Grandpa!

49:06.250 --> 49:09.557
Take him home.
Keep an eye on him.

49:11.783 --> 49:12.852
Dad!

49:13.016 --> 49:16.324
You idiot!
You got arrested again?!

49:16.616 --> 49:18.682
You call yourself his brother?

49:18.683 --> 49:20.249
- Let's go, dad.
- Grandpa...

49:20.250 --> 49:20.715
Take care.

49:20.716 --> 49:21.982
I dunno who's in trouble.

49:21.983 --> 49:24.449
Let's just go
come on now

49:24.450 --> 49:26.223
Thank you officer.

49:32.116 --> 49:35.060
How often does he do this?

49:36.683 --> 49:38.161
Now and again

49:39.016 --> 49:42.153
He's fine when he comes to.

49:44.283 --> 49:46.954
You're the blissful one, dipshit.

49:49.183 --> 49:52.127
How could you let him
continue to drive the bus?

49:53.450 --> 49:56.155
The funny thing is,
he doesn't forget his route.

49:58.283 --> 50:01.193
Just focus on your own life.

50:01.417 --> 50:04.982
Buddy,
focus on the matter at hand!

50:04.983 --> 50:06.282
Are you his son?

50:06.283 --> 50:08.648
What about you then?

50:08.649 --> 50:10.684
This is the best you can do
as his son?

50:11.983 --> 50:15.257
Perhaps you should
take him to jail with you.

50:15.417 --> 50:16.548
You model bastard!

50:16.549 --> 50:18.082
Goddammit!

50:18.083 --> 50:19.788
Piss off!

50:36.317 --> 50:37.692
You fucking pig

50:37.749 --> 50:40.748
How dare you!
You red-ass monkey!

50:40.749 --> 50:42.548
- Tae-il! Honey!
- Son of bitch!

50:42.549 --> 50:46.119
- Stop right there!
- Stop fighting!

50:59.216 --> 51:00.250
Ho-jung

51:03.783 --> 51:05.455
How did you find me?

51:09.283 --> 51:10.988
Here...

51:13.516 --> 51:15.824
Do you not even feel sorry?

51:24.649 --> 51:26.957
I wish you'd kill yourself.

53:29.216 --> 53:30.615
Why are you doing this?!

53:30.616 --> 53:34.049
Warden, I'm not leaving!
I'll never leave!

53:34.050 --> 53:36.392
Everyone's itching to leave here!

53:36.549 --> 53:40.349
You can't stay anymore,
that's the law!

53:40.350 --> 53:41.691
It's a done deal.

53:42.716 --> 53:46.982
You got maybe
3 months to live.

53:46.983 --> 53:50.482
Some professional

53:50.483 --> 53:53.188
and get your affairs in order

54:04.350 --> 54:06.759
<i>2 years ago</i>

54:14.816 --> 54:16.123
Watcha doing?

54:16.417 --> 54:20.327
We got a laundry machine
for that.

54:21.649 --> 54:22.991
I'm done.

54:24.216 --> 54:25.091
Sweetie!

54:25.950 --> 54:27.950
Let's hike up that mountain.

54:28.016 --> 54:31.290
Hike? Walking up here
is a hike.

54:46.883 --> 54:47.758
Here!

54:49.483 --> 54:50.960
Come on, let's go.

54:53.116 --> 54:54.718
Damn.

54:56.383 --> 54:57.655
Holy cow...

54:58.616 --> 55:00.253
Love ya, shit!

55:08.583 --> 55:12.084
I wish you didn't
associate with them.

55:15.083 --> 55:18.249
And maybe get a new job too.

55:18.250 --> 55:21.228
Fine, no need for this again.

55:22.317 --> 55:25.851
Honey, how about
a chicken shop?

55:27.516 --> 55:28.653
Chicken shop?

55:29.916 --> 55:32.360
You like chicken the best.

55:36.317 --> 55:39.454
I wish everything was chicken.

55:41.450 --> 55:45.689
What if we go down under
'cause you eat everything?

55:53.783 --> 55:55.056
Sweetie.

55:56.383 --> 55:58.088
Should we have a kid?

55:59.583 --> 55:59.848
$3~400,000 circulate
in one night.

55:59.849 --> 56:03.782
$3~400,000 circulate
in one night.

56:03.783 --> 56:06.115
Clientele list is complete.

56:06.116 --> 56:10.185
She wants to play again?
She's got spidey senses.

56:12.716 --> 56:15.751
Come to meeting on time
look at the time!

56:16.283 --> 56:18.556
We got a killer job,
come sit down.

56:19.050 --> 56:20.084
Doo-chul

56:20.883 --> 56:22.792
I want to quit.

56:24.950 --> 56:28.019
Take 5,
go have a smoke.

56:34.849 --> 56:40.021
I hear you loud and clear,
but how will you make a living?

56:40.983 --> 56:44.018
You don't even have
a saving.

56:44.283 --> 56:47.261
You need money
to start anew.

56:47.816 --> 56:51.589
This is a good gig,
walk away with a fortune.

56:52.749 --> 56:53.615
Doo-chul!

56:53.616 --> 56:58.027
One last big score,
and we both retire

57:01.216 --> 57:02.557
She put you up to this?

57:02.616 --> 57:04.149
Goddammit...

57:04.150 --> 57:09.185
Then why is it so fucking hard
to take an easy job?!

57:13.849 --> 57:14.758
I'm off.

57:16.050 --> 57:16.959
Buddy!

57:17.816 --> 57:20.351
What about the loans
you gave privately?

57:21.317 --> 57:24.658
You always have it your way.

57:24.716 --> 57:27.751
So free, aren't ya?

57:29.216 --> 57:32.750
I'll sort all the loans,
so don't lose sleep over it.

57:36.849 --> 57:38.986
Please!
I need more time!

57:39.283 --> 57:42.115
1 week!
Just give me 1 week!

57:42.116 --> 57:44.615
Lord created this world
in a week!

57:44.616 --> 57:47.185
That's for the Lord!
Please don't!

57:49.216 --> 57:52.023
Mr. HAN, not that!

57:53.283 --> 57:55.149
Mr. HAN! Mr. HAN!

57:55.150 --> 57:56.219
Nothing's in there!

57:58.916 --> 58:01.190
Open it, now!

58:01.250 --> 58:04.057
- Please...
- Open it!

58:04.516 --> 58:05.721
Open!

58:22.749 --> 58:24.548
Biopsy for what?

58:24.549 --> 58:26.618
I just fainted

58:27.816 --> 58:28.548
What?

58:28.549 --> 58:30.618
Are you sure?!

58:34.150 --> 58:37.182
As you see here,

58:37.183 --> 58:39.416
cerebrum and frontal lobe
are white.

58:39.417 --> 58:42.258
It's a small tumor.

58:44.649 --> 58:47.855
- If it's malignant...
- Will I die?

58:48.183 --> 58:50.682
You have to be
open to treatments...

58:50.683 --> 58:54.149
Is it expensive?

58:54.150 --> 58:57.449
You'll need both radiation
and chemotherapies.

58:57.450 --> 59:00.189
I want a straight answer!

59:00.250 --> 59:02.989
So how much will it cost?!

59:05.583 --> 59:06.822
Hey, you're home?

59:17.083 --> 59:20.391
Sweetie, here.

59:25.683 --> 59:30.253
Dad's insurance
and I saved some up

59:30.783 --> 59:35.285
We can start
a good chicken shop

59:36.183 --> 59:41.923
Then we'll get married,
and have a beautiful child.

59:44.350 --> 59:47.328
Yeah, let's eat.

1:00:03.883 --> 1:00:05.361
I love ya.

1:00:07.883 --> 1:00:09.293
Shit.

1:00:15.950 --> 1:00:17.223
Come on, eat.

1:00:38.616 --> 1:00:41.356
So dang expensive.

1:00:41.616 --> 1:00:43.390
Not even that good.

1:00:46.816 --> 1:00:49.851
We can deliver,
we don't need a big shop

1:00:50.883 --> 1:00:52.724
Let's look around more.

1:00:53.450 --> 1:00:55.428
Didn't you come out
during lunch break?

1:00:56.216 --> 1:00:57.319
Yup.

1:00:59.649 --> 1:01:01.355
I'll call after work.

1:01:03.150 --> 1:01:04.855
Go straight home

1:01:05.649 --> 1:01:06.752
Okay

1:01:07.383 --> 1:01:08.682
Don't wander off.

1:01:08.683 --> 1:01:11.287
I got it,
get back to work.

1:01:13.083 --> 1:01:13.924
I'm off.

1:01:23.983 --> 1:01:25.461
There's nothing else?

1:01:25.983 --> 1:01:29.052
Honestly, not at that budget

1:01:29.317 --> 1:01:31.555
You've seen it all

1:01:33.016 --> 1:01:35.187
Maybe in the outskirts.

1:01:36.216 --> 1:01:41.285
But you should really start
the business in a good spot.

1:01:48.883 --> 1:01:51.827
You liked the shop we saw, right?

1:01:53.150 --> 1:01:57.026
No, there'll be something better.

1:01:59.317 --> 1:02:01.454
Let's sign that place.

1:02:02.050 --> 1:02:07.222
It's okay,
we can start small.

1:02:18.383 --> 1:02:20.019
Ho-jung

1:02:20.150 --> 1:02:23.249
Wasn't it difficult?
When your father was sick.

1:02:23.250 --> 1:02:25.455
Don't even mention it

1:02:25.783 --> 1:02:28.852
You gave me more stress.

1:02:30.083 --> 1:02:36.084
But it felt as though
he left me with you.

1:02:39.849 --> 1:02:41.122
Good to see you.

1:02:41.583 --> 1:02:44.357
Been a while,
you doing okay?

1:02:46.649 --> 1:02:49.786
It's for the last time,
living like a dog.

1:02:54.417 --> 1:02:56.019
30 grand.

1:02:57.749 --> 1:03:02.387
Doo-chul,
if this goes wrong...

1:03:06.549 --> 1:03:09.891
You know me,
I'm better with big scores.

1:03:09.983 --> 1:03:14.359
And would I ask you to
hop on a sinking ship?

1:03:15.616 --> 1:03:17.848
This is totally different.

1:03:17.849 --> 1:03:20.049
We just march head on.

1:03:20.050 --> 1:03:21.615
Boss.

1:03:21.616 --> 1:03:22.682
We got a situation.

1:03:22.683 --> 1:03:25.457
Can't you see we're talking?

1:03:26.549 --> 1:03:28.549
Something important?

1:03:31.816 --> 1:03:33.055
Take this money

1:03:33.816 --> 1:03:36.158
Sir, gotta take care of this

1:03:36.950 --> 1:03:38.894
Let's talk again later.

1:03:38.983 --> 1:03:40.585
Have some food

1:03:56.483 --> 1:04:02.359
Honey, we sign today,
don't be late

1:04:05.549 --> 1:04:07.584
I'll see you later.

1:04:11.549 --> 1:04:14.715
<i>This is huge.
I don't need your money.</i>

1:04:14.716 --> 1:04:19.711
<i>But we're friends,
consider this your severance.</i>

1:04:19.950 --> 1:04:22.049
<i>Trust me,
and back me up.</i>

1:04:22.050 --> 1:04:25.392
<i>I'll give you 4,
no, 5 times the amount.</i>

1:04:25.749 --> 1:04:27.091
<i>Please don't be late</i>

1:04:29.616 --> 1:04:33.026
<i>We'll start soon,
please take your seat.</i>

1:04:36.383 --> 1:04:37.621
<i>We'll now start.</i>

1:04:38.016 --> 1:04:42.051
<i>Card for player,
card for banker...</i>

1:04:43.516 --> 1:04:45.290
<i>Player, natural 8.</i>

1:04:46.150 --> 1:04:47.548
<i>Banker, nature! 9.</i>

1:04:47.549 --> 1:04:48.720
<i>Banker wins.</i>

1:04:57.749 --> 1:05:00.784
<i>We'll start.
Card for ...</i>

1:05:01.350 --> 1:05:05.760
The last tenant hitted big,
you'll do really well.

1:05:07.450 --> 1:05:09.586
Evening sir, come in.

1:05:09.716 --> 1:05:10.582
Hello.

1:05:10.583 --> 1:05:12.049
This is the signee.

1:05:12.050 --> 1:05:12.982
Good evening.

1:05:12.983 --> 1:05:14.427
This is the owner.

1:05:15.283 --> 1:05:17.454
<i>Banker natural 9,
banker wins.</i>

1:05:25.516 --> 1:05:26.982
<i>Draw 6, max 8.</i>

1:05:26.983 --> 1:05:28.517
<i>Ho-jung</i>

1:05:29.616 --> 1:05:32.151
<i>Draw 5, max 9,
banker wins.</i>

1:05:37.183 --> 1:05:39.354
Is she serious about this?

1:05:39.616 --> 1:05:40.753
Just a bit longer

1:05:57.016 --> 1:05:59.358
Exchange booth!
Stop them!

1:06:07.450 --> 1:06:09.121
Doo-chul! Doo-chul!

1:06:09.516 --> 1:06:10.994
Doo-chul!

1:06:19.516 --> 1:06:21.392
Let's go! Go now!

1:06:21.916 --> 1:06:25.087
Let's go!

1:06:27.383 --> 1:06:28.417
Let's go!

1:06:29.816 --> 1:06:31.158
Goddamn shit!

1:06:32.516 --> 1:06:33.755
Son of a bitch!

1:06:46.016 --> 1:06:48.085
Let's go

1:06:50.417 --> 1:06:52.156
Motherfucker!

1:06:54.350 --> 1:06:55.827
Go!

1:07:01.016 --> 1:07:02.449
- No deal.
- Sir!

1:07:02.450 --> 1:07:04.482
Sir, please wait!

1:07:04.483 --> 1:07:05.449
- Sir!
- Forget it!

1:07:05.450 --> 1:07:07.349
Sir, please hear me out

1:07:07.350 --> 1:07:09.015
He'll be here very soon.

1:07:09.016 --> 1:07:10.721
Sir!

1:08:43.583 --> 1:08:45.425
Got nothing to say?

1:08:47.016 --> 1:08:49.358
Make an excuse.

1:08:50.749 --> 1:08:56.387
Explain where you were,
why you couldn't come,

1:08:57.749 --> 1:09:00.023
and about your face

1:09:03.616 --> 1:09:06.719
Do you know
what the realtor said?

1:09:08.816 --> 1:09:12.760
Ambitions should
match your abilities.

1:09:15.883 --> 1:09:20.294
Gangsters can't lead
a normal life.

1:09:22.883 --> 1:09:27.657
You promised me,
you said you won't see them!

1:09:27.983 --> 1:09:32.291
Just stop,
I feel bad enough.

1:09:32.716 --> 1:09:35.626
Why did you do it?!

1:09:35.716 --> 1:09:37.853
Stop it, goddammit!

1:09:39.150 --> 1:09:41.094
Don't you know who I am?!

1:09:41.350 --> 1:09:44.691
I'm much worse than this!

1:09:45.283 --> 1:09:47.760
Fuck, I think you're mistaken.

1:09:49.083 --> 1:09:51.686
Did you think I'd marry you?!

1:09:56.616 --> 1:09:59.060
Goddamn bitch...

1:10:30.849 --> 1:10:32.915
'You promised me.'

1:10:32.916 --> 1:10:36.519
- 'Why did you do it?'
- Let's go home.

1:10:40.649 --> 1:10:41.423
Let's go

1:10:41.483 --> 1:10:44.848
Bitches nowadays are tough.

1:10:44.849 --> 1:10:46.554
Ma'am, check please!

1:10:47.983 --> 1:10:50.325
Motherfucker!

1:10:50.983 --> 1:10:52.325
That fuck!

1:10:54.516 --> 1:10:55.349
Let him be.

1:10:55.350 --> 1:10:56.691
Dumbass bitch!

1:10:57.483 --> 1:10:59.483
He's fucking insane!

1:11:00.016 --> 1:11:02.358
God-fucking-damn!

1:11:31.783 --> 1:11:32.760
Son of a bitch!

1:11:36.216 --> 1:11:37.784
Motherfucker!

1:11:40.250 --> 1:11:43.082
What did I fucking do?!

1:11:43.083 --> 1:11:46.993
Go fuck yourselves!
Motherfucker!

1:11:52.883 --> 1:11:54.293
<i>Defendant HAN Tae-il</i>

1:11:54.616 --> 1:11:58.583
<i>For violent assaults,

1:11:58.849 --> 1:12:03.055
<i>Probation Agreement

1:12:05.883 --> 1:12:07.861
How long will you
keep it to yourself?

1:12:10.317 --> 1:12:12.658
They don't need to know.

1:12:18.383 --> 1:12:19.417
Treatment?

1:12:21.417 --> 1:12:25.554
Getting treatment is part of
your release condition.

1:12:29.983 --> 1:12:31.017
Sir

1:12:31.883 --> 1:12:34.884
Have you heard of
Doo-chul's whereabouts?

1:12:35.283 --> 1:12:36.226
Why?

1:12:39.783 --> 1:12:42.989
<i>Just say hello,

1:12:43.916 --> 1:12:46.519

<i>Buan industrial Refrigeration</i>

1:12:59.250 --> 1:13:00.349
Afternoon, boss.

1:13:00.350 --> 1:13:01.419
Hey

1:13:04.050 --> 1:13:05.255
JANG Doo-chul!

1:13:14.417 --> 1:13:17.515
- Did you count the pollacks?
- Yes, it's done.

1:13:17.516 --> 1:13:19.085
- Correct number?
- Yes

1:13:19.783 --> 1:13:21.284
- Count it again.
- Yes, sir.

1:13:27.150 --> 1:13:30.650
Everything has changed

1:13:33.283 --> 1:13:34.555
I see that.

1:13:36.516 --> 1:13:41.790
Doo-chul, I want my money.

1:13:41.849 --> 1:13:48.089
It's not like you,
digging up old grudges.

1:13:48.549 --> 1:13:51.925
Just give me
my fucking money

1:13:52.616 --> 1:13:56.060
You've changed too.

1:13:58.417 --> 1:14:00.486
Probably ready to die.

1:14:03.183 --> 1:14:05.354
You look busy,
I'll see you tonight.

1:14:06.616 --> 1:14:08.424
You got my number.

1:14:12.417 --> 1:14:13.417
Tae-il!

1:14:15.849 --> 1:14:17.520
Don't come back.

1:14:18.649 --> 1:14:22.889
Awkwardness is okay
but not burden

1:15:10.816 --> 1:15:14.454
What's going on?!

1:15:14.616 --> 1:15:15.682
- I'm sorry, boss.
- What is it!

1:15:15.683 --> 1:15:17.524
- I'm sorry.
- What's this stench?

1:15:18.250 --> 1:15:19.955
Let go, let go.

1:15:20.083 --> 1:15:21.651
Fuck off!

1:15:22.417 --> 1:15:23.519
Let go

1:15:31.983 --> 1:15:33.290
Got a smoke?

1:15:34.849 --> 1:15:39.260
I lost 'em while shitting,
just have my lighter.

1:15:40.583 --> 1:15:42.255
Dammit...

1:15:43.083 --> 1:15:45.924
What the fuck did you do?

1:15:46.549 --> 1:15:48.686
You messed him up?

1:15:48.749 --> 1:15:51.693
Lift your head, fucker!

1:15:55.516 --> 1:15:59.359
I never liked this
gold-toothed bastard

1:16:00.616 --> 1:16:04.390
Doo-chul, isn't this
what you wanted?

1:16:11.283 --> 1:16:12.954
I told you,

1:16:13.983 --> 1:16:19.757
Everything has changed

1:16:56.683 --> 1:16:57.854
Chilly?

1:16:58.816 --> 1:17:01.488
We've grown old

1:17:03.616 --> 1:17:07.719
Tae-il, don't come back

1:17:08.417 --> 1:17:11.224
I don't want to
feel sorry for you.

1:17:14.150 --> 1:17:15.957
Go have a hot soup.

1:17:19.950 --> 1:17:21.189
Doo-chul...

1:17:25.150 --> 1:17:27.219
I'm dying...

1:17:28.116 --> 1:17:30.923
Goddammit!

1:17:39.216 --> 1:17:41.421
That's my head.

1:17:43.317 --> 1:17:45.760
The white spot is a tumor.

1:17:46.883 --> 1:17:50.487
I was gonna die in the joint,
but they won't let me.

1:17:51.350 --> 1:17:54.816
I got nothing left to lose

1:17:56.016 --> 1:17:57.789
Doo-chul

1:17:58.716 --> 1:18:01.456
How'd you feel when I die?

1:18:05.016 --> 1:18:09.461
My friend,
it's my last favor.

1:18:10.183 --> 1:18:16.253
I'll never resent you,
just give me my money.

1:18:33.983 --> 1:18:35.256
JU Ho-jung!

1:18:47.649 --> 1:18:48.956
Here

1:18:52.683 --> 1:18:54.491
Back at it again?

1:18:55.317 --> 1:18:57.488
Expect me to take
this dirty money?

1:18:58.450 --> 1:19:01.223
I don't need you,
or this, so piss off!

1:19:03.816 --> 1:19:05.089
Ho-jung

1:19:06.716 --> 1:19:07.887
Honey

1:19:08.816 --> 1:19:10.851
Do you know
how I feel everyday?

1:19:10.950 --> 1:19:13.621
And what about my life then?

1:19:18.916 --> 1:19:20.223
JU Ho-jung!

1:19:20.583 --> 1:19:23.382
Honey, you have to
take this, please!

1:19:23.383 --> 1:19:24.915
You have to take this!

1:19:24.916 --> 1:19:26.015
- Let me go!
- Please!

1:19:26.016 --> 1:19:27.182
Let go!

1:19:27.183 --> 1:19:29.049
Let me go!

1:19:29.050 --> 1:19:31.289
Let go!

1:19:32.417 --> 1:19:35.986
Don't touch me!

1:19:37.683 --> 1:19:38.888
Let go!

1:19:39.450 --> 1:19:40.859
Please.

1:19:41.783 --> 1:19:44.349
Moment,
just one moment.

1:19:44.350 --> 1:19:46.949
Just a little...

1:19:46.950 --> 1:19:48.485
Please.

1:19:48.583 --> 1:19:50.027
Please.

1:20:09.317 --> 1:20:10.817
6

1:20:11.783 --> 1:20:13.590
7

1:20:15.116 --> 1:20:16.821
8

1:20:18.649 --> 1:20:20.321
9

1:20:23.549 --> 1:20:25.323
And 10.

1:20:25.849 --> 1:20:27.249
- 11
- What's that?

1:20:27.250 --> 1:20:30.285
Damn, I] lost count-l

1:20:32.283 --> 1:20:34.124
What is that?!

1:20:34.183 --> 1:20:36.648
I'm not deaf,
be quiet!

1:20:36.649 --> 1:20:39.525
What the hell are you doing?!

1:20:40.383 --> 1:20:42.815
The outer layer was so crisp.

1:20:42.816 --> 1:20:44.816
You can't make that
at home.

1:20:45.350 --> 1:20:48.419
Why are you
all worked up again?

1:20:50.749 --> 1:20:53.886
Look at that hand,
did you fight again?

1:20:54.150 --> 1:20:57.515
I'm broke,
can't bail you out this time.

1:20:57.516 --> 1:20:57.982
What's with you?!

1:20:57.983 --> 1:20:58.715
Fuck!

1:20:58.716 --> 1:21:01.626
Have you gone mad?!

1:21:02.417 --> 1:21:03.182
Asshole!

1:21:03.183 --> 1:21:05.717
Stop it!
Tae-il, are you nuts?!

1:21:06.417 --> 1:21:08.115
What the fuck?!

1:21:08.116 --> 1:21:12.982
What's dad doing?
Did you force him to work?!

1:21:12.983 --> 1:21:18.291
Assfucker
because I'm so greedy!

1:21:18.383 --> 1:21:22.615
Have you ever helped out
the family once?!

1:21:22.616 --> 1:21:24.185
Fucking asshole!

1:21:25.050 --> 1:21:26.615
Uncle!

1:21:26.616 --> 1:21:27.889
Hit me!

1:21:31.216 --> 1:21:35.785
Ungrateful bastards!
How dare you!

1:21:37.383 --> 1:21:39.019
No better than dogs.

1:21:41.516 --> 1:21:44.461
Goddammit!

1:21:46.816 --> 1:21:50.658
Seriously...

1:21:52.050 --> 1:21:54.687
I'm sick and tired of this...

1:21:56.516 --> 1:21:58.426
Right there

1:22:01.583 --> 1:22:03.220
Lift your head.

1:22:06.016 --> 1:22:11.756
Where you going?

1:22:11.849 --> 1:22:14.815
I'm gonna give
the ointment to Tae-il.

1:22:14.816 --> 1:22:19.318
Don't go!
Are you worried about him?

1:22:20.116 --> 1:22:22.815
Of course,
he's your brother

1:22:22.816 --> 1:22:24.192
Don't go!

1:22:24.749 --> 1:22:26.349
Stay put,
I'll give it to Song then.

1:22:26.350 --> 1:22:28.682
Don't go! Sit!

1:22:28.683 --> 1:22:32.059
What's with you?

1:22:35.016 --> 1:22:40.011
When Tae-il got beat up
on his high school trip.

1:22:40.816 --> 1:22:41.615
Yeah?

1:22:41.616 --> 1:22:45.890
You left ointment
on our front door, right?

1:22:49.516 --> 1:22:50.823
You saw?

1:22:53.116 --> 1:22:54.150
What?

1:22:56.083 --> 1:22:57.117
Hey!

1:22:57.849 --> 1:23:00.316
Rub his asshole with it!

1:23:00.317 --> 1:23:04.090
Rub it nice
and kiss it too!

1:23:06.983 --> 1:23:09.359
Goddammit!
Ouch...

1:23:14.250 --> 1:23:16.353
Uncovering the truth
after 20 years.

1:23:22.616 --> 1:23:24.855
Ow that hurts...

1:23:27.417 --> 1:23:32.122
The doctor said, using fingers
help with memory

1:23:32.716 --> 1:23:35.320
Dad managed to find
the box folding gig.

1:23:37.050 --> 1:23:41.882
Grandpa's not so bad
because of dad's efforts,

1:23:41.883 --> 1:23:45.215
we praised him for that,
you didn't even fucking know.

1:23:45.216 --> 1:23:49.183
Yo! Can you
not swear so much?

1:23:49.250 --> 1:23:52.421
Fuck that,
you want me to be a mute?

1:24:02.916 --> 1:24:04.121
I'm sorry, dad.

1:24:05.150 --> 1:24:06.321
For what?

1:24:07.683 --> 1:24:09.059
For fighting with him.

1:24:12.050 --> 1:24:15.426
You could've kicked his ass.

1:24:16.483 --> 1:24:17.516
Of course.

1:24:19.183 --> 1:24:21.524
He needs a proper beating.

1:24:22.116 --> 1:24:22.991
Why?

1:24:23.716 --> 1:24:26.490
He blames me for his life.

1:24:27.183 --> 1:24:32.287
For your mom leaving,
for not getting into college

1:24:32.983 --> 1:24:35.325
that's why
he settled as a barber

1:24:36.216 --> 1:24:38.887
He's just feeble-minded,
that's all.

1:24:39.116 --> 1:24:41.821
You're wiser,
please understand him

1:24:42.516 --> 1:24:48.018
He's still a good kid,
be nice to him.

1:24:48.783 --> 1:24:53.887
He's trying to
make something of his life.

1:24:54.549 --> 1:24:58.460
Make up your mind,
whose side are you on?

1:25:09.983 --> 1:25:11.052
Dad.

1:25:13.050 --> 1:25:14.925
I heard
your head's cloudy.

1:25:16.350 --> 1:25:17.453
Me?

1:25:17.883 --> 1:25:20.191
I hear you forget stuff.

1:25:21.216 --> 1:25:22.387
Nope.

1:25:24.649 --> 1:25:27.127
Over time,
you won't remember me?

1:25:34.050 --> 1:25:38.653
Good, you'll forget
all the troubles I caused.

1:25:48.516 --> 1:25:51.290
- What are you doing?
- Hold still.

1:26:02.649 --> 1:26:08.117
Even if you forget everything,
don't forget this.

1:26:09.216 --> 1:26:11.160
I'm being a good son

1:26:11.350 --> 1:26:13.021
Don't forget it.

1:26:16.150 --> 1:26:17.389
Get married.

1:26:19.450 --> 1:26:23.326
That's how you become
a good son.

1:26:49.083 --> 1:26:51.254
So damn skinny

1:27:02.549 --> 1:27:04.459
Sir, how much is this?

1:27:04.583 --> 1:27:07.027
$10, would you like one?

1:27:30.849 --> 1:27:31.883
Am I late?

1:27:34.716 --> 1:27:36.058
What are you doing?

1:27:38.883 --> 1:27:41.759
Paying my respect.

1:27:41.816 --> 1:27:43.623
What right do you have?!

1:27:44.749 --> 1:27:49.625
Don't be like that,
I was almost his son-in-law.

1:28:04.417 --> 1:28:07.327
Done? Go now.

1:28:11.683 --> 1:28:16.389
Don't be so harsh
I'm not even worth hating

1:28:25.883 --> 1:28:27.554
I'm leaving here.

1:28:35.816 --> 1:28:37.816
I came to see you
one last time.

1:28:39.649 --> 1:28:47.083
You might not believe me,
but I wanted to apologize.

1:28:53.683 --> 1:28:56.786
Fine, just go.

1:29:04.450 --> 1:29:05.927
Have a good life.

1:29:53.050 --> 1:29:55.687
- Want it?
- Hey, uncle.

1:29:56.250 --> 1:29:57.591
Come here, come

1:29:58.016 --> 1:29:59.982
Isn't that white one hot?

1:29:59.983 --> 1:30:02.257
Uncle, can you steal me one?

1:30:04.483 --> 1:30:07.515
Regularly!

1:30:07.516 --> 1:30:09.461
Take a good look!

1:30:13.116 --> 1:30:15.321
Only I have a dumbphone.

1:30:15.849 --> 1:30:17.782
Everyone's got smartphones!

1:30:17.783 --> 1:30:20.727
It's so embarrassing
at school!

1:30:21.883 --> 1:30:24.452
Ow, I bit my tongue!

1:30:24.549 --> 1:30:26.149
Get! You little twat!

1:30:26.150 --> 1:30:28.492
So fucking annoying!

1:31:04.150 --> 1:31:06.287
Sir, please don't do that!

1:31:06.816 --> 1:31:09.416
Honey, I'm done.

1:31:09.417 --> 1:31:12.622
This isn't the place,
please leave.

1:31:12.716 --> 1:31:16.388
Isn't the place?
Anythings possible.

1:31:16.783 --> 1:31:19.352
Honey, be the better man.

1:31:19.483 --> 1:31:22.359
This isn't a whorehouse,
please go.

1:31:23.083 --> 1:31:25.083
Motherfucker

1:31:28.649 --> 1:31:29.786
Say that again.

1:31:29.916 --> 1:31:31.615
Please leave!

1:31:31.616 --> 1:31:33.182
- Stay back!
- Honey!

1:31:33.183 --> 1:31:34.524
Stay back!

1:31:37.016 --> 1:31:40.051
I said we're not like that,
apologize to her.

1:31:40.516 --> 1:31:44.222
Apologize?
To a barber?!

1:31:45.016 --> 1:31:47.392
Yeah! Yeah!

1:31:53.317 --> 1:31:55.249
- What if I don't?
- Hey!

1:31:55.250 --> 1:31:57.449
What if I don't want to?

1:31:57.450 --> 1:32:00.326
- Motherfucker!
- You're nuts!

1:32:00.816 --> 1:32:02.848
The fuck you're doing?!

1:32:02.849 --> 1:32:05.588
Who the fuck are you?!

1:32:06.050 --> 1:32:08.085
- Asshole!
- Fucker!

1:32:10.417 --> 1:32:11.182
Fucking bastard!

1:32:11.183 --> 1:32:14.389
You fucker! Fucker!

1:32:20.683 --> 1:32:22.115
Motherfucker!

1:32:22.116 --> 1:32:23.715
That the best you got?!

1:32:23.716 --> 1:32:27.082
- Hello? Police?
- Com here, get up!

1:32:27.083 --> 1:32:27.582
You come here!

1:32:27.583 --> 1:32:29.788
Motherfucker!

1:33:10.616 --> 1:33:12.288
Tae-il

1:33:14.883 --> 1:33:17.122
As your sister-in-law,

1:33:18.250 --> 1:33:20.023
I have a favor.

1:33:21.983 --> 1:33:24.052
Could you leave home?

1:33:25.916 --> 1:33:29.486
There's no room,
and Songs growing up,

1:33:31.649 --> 1:33:33.684
and I don't feel comfortable.

1:33:45.317 --> 1:33:47.590
Honey, seriously!

1:33:51.450 --> 1:33:52.927
Enough.

1:33:53.649 --> 1:33:54.922
We got a shop to run

1:34:13.317 --> 1:34:14.589
Uncle!

1:34:15.883 --> 1:34:17.452
Uncle!

1:34:21.716 --> 1:34:22.693
Uncle!

1:34:23.417 --> 1:34:24.553
What?

1:34:25.216 --> 1:34:27.982
Dad says you should
go away for 3 days.

1:34:27.983 --> 1:34:30.120
Mom will cool down by then.

1:34:30.816 --> 1:34:33.260
Here, it's from dad.

1:34:33.317 --> 1:34:35.454
He said not to tell mom.

1:34:39.816 --> 1:34:41.725
And this

1:34:42.016 --> 1:34:46.015
Here, from mom
She knows you're broke

1:34:46.016 --> 1:34:48.153
She said not to mention
this to dad.

1:34:48.216 --> 1:34:52.815
They got a communication problem.

1:34:52.816 --> 1:34:55.090
7 year itch maybe?

1:34:55.516 --> 1:34:57.188
Take it!

1:35:05.783 --> 1:35:06.783
Bye.

1:35:06.950 --> 1:35:08.087
Song

1:35:08.849 --> 1:35:10.452
Be good to your dad.

1:35:11.450 --> 1:35:14.682
Only he can
put up with our shit.

1:35:14.683 --> 1:35:16.482
Whatever

1:35:16.483 --> 1:35:18.316
- Uncle!
- What?

1:35:18.317 --> 1:35:21.193
We all knew that except you.

1:35:21.916 --> 1:35:22.985
Bye.

1:35:24.849 --> 1:35:26.548
Stop swearing.

1:35:26.549 --> 1:35:27.925
Fuck you

1:36:23.583 --> 1:36:27.548
You're so much prettier
in person

1:36:27.549 --> 1:36:29.582
See? I told you.

1:36:29.583 --> 1:36:30.748
Please.

1:36:30.749 --> 1:36:32.318
Sorry.

1:36:32.616 --> 1:36:34.992
Got anything
you wanna ask him?

1:36:37.317 --> 1:36:40.352
Please feel free.

1:36:40.649 --> 1:36:41.683
Sure.

1:38:32.317 --> 1:38:33.817
It's been paid

1:38:34.649 --> 1:38:36.649
Your guardian already paid.

1:38:36.816 --> 1:38:37.725
What?

1:38:42.549 --> 1:38:44.686
Isn't Ms. JU Ho-jung
your guardian?

1:39:13.216 --> 1:39:16.092
<i>He found out 2 years ago.</i>

1:39:16.616 --> 1:39:21.611
<i>He never even got
treated in jail, that idiot.</i>

1:39:21.783 --> 1:39:24.949
<i>Now you know...</i>

1:39:24.950 --> 1:39:29.282
<i>His sentence was suspended
because of it,</i>

1:39:29.283 --> 1:39:35.852
<i>he served half of his sentence,
and was declared terminally ill.</i>

1:42:12.483 --> 1:42:12.748
Who is it?

1:42:12.749 --> 1:42:14.056
Who is it?

1:42:14.950 --> 1:42:16.848
- Ms. HAN Song-ji?
- Yes, it's me

1:42:16.849 --> 1:42:17.918
Here you go.

1:42:19.749 --> 1:42:21.658
- Good bye.
- Bye.

1:42:24.417 --> 1:42:27.049
So fucking hot!

1:42:27.050 --> 1:42:30.460
Holy fucking shit!

1:42:30.549 --> 1:42:31.720
Fuck!

1:42:35.250 --> 1:42:36.727
<i>It was hard stealing it,
go to college</i>

1:42:36.883 --> 1:42:38.782
He did it!

1:42:38.783 --> 1:42:40.149
Uncle!

1:42:40.150 --> 1:42:43.616
I fucking love it!

1:43:45.983 --> 1:43:49.316
Fine, let's see
how good you are.

1:43:49.317 --> 1:43:50.488
Bang! Bang!

1:43:50.983 --> 1:43:54.582
Crash! What?!

1:43:54.583 --> 1:43:58.082
What is that?
Hit me!

1:43:58.083 --> 1:44:02.015
Didn't I say I'll risk my life
for my innocence?

1:44:02.016 --> 1:44:04.449
I'll prove it with death.

1:44:04.450 --> 1:44:06.715
Moron, what are you saying?!

1:44:06.716 --> 1:44:09.082
One hit will kill you,
stay away!

1:44:09.083 --> 1:44:11.582
Yes, priest,
your body is...

1:44:11.583 --> 1:44:13.993
Shut up!

1:44:22.016 --> 1:44:23.460
Hurts?

1:44:28.016 --> 1:44:29.550
So much

1:44:32.183 --> 1:44:34.683
Isn't it stuffy being here?

1:44:34.983 --> 1:44:37.654
Of course,
so stuffy here.

1:44:38.483 --> 1:44:40.119
Wanna eat anything?

1:44:43.150 --> 1:44:44.093
You.

1:44:48.983 --> 1:44:50.790
Wanna do anything?

1:44:55.549 --> 1:45:00.426
A walk, and a chat.

1:46:03.183 --> 1:46:04.092
His chart.

1:47:59.016 --> 1:48:00.687
I...

1:48:02.450 --> 1:48:04.121
love you too.

1:48:43.516 --> 1:48:44.926
Sir

1:48:47.649 --> 1:48:49.355
That bastard...

1:48:51.516 --> 1:48:55.790
Is making me
bow to him now.

1:48:57.317 --> 1:48:58.760
Dammit...

1:49:00.016 --> 1:49:02.085
I knelt down...

1:49:40.849 --> 1:49:41.849
Dad.

1:49:43.749 --> 1:49:46.727
I actually almost got married.

1:49:49.683 --> 1:49:51.820
But I messed it all up.

1:49:55.483 --> 1:49:57.517
You know my life's a mess.

1:50:03.350 --> 1:50:06.953
You know that Suhyup Bank?
She works there.

1:50:08.749 --> 1:50:10.852
So pretty and
a devoted daughter.

1:50:18.816 --> 1:50:25.022
When her dad was sick,
she took care of him.

1:50:30.716 --> 1:50:36.683
How can I ask her
to take care of me?

1:50:38.583 --> 1:50:41.959
I wanted to give her the money
and disappear...

1:50:56.916 --> 1:51:02.452
Even when I'm gone,
please be good to her.

1:51:09.450 --> 1:51:11.086
She doesn't have a dad.

1:51:11.950 --> 1:51:15.758
So you become her dad.

1:51:23.983 --> 1:51:29.052
She's a girl
your son really loves

1:51:37.483 --> 1:51:38.983
You hear me?

1:51:58.883 --> 1:52:00.361
I'm sorry, father.

1:53:10.116 --> 1:53:14.182
<i>"On a cold day,
I long for him...</i>

1:53:14.183 --> 1:53:21.821

1:53:22.716 --> 1:53:24.382
<i>I agree</i>

<i>They say time is

1:53:44.283 --> 1:53:48.349
<i>But I think those moments you shared
remain clear as time passes.</i>

1:53:51.616 --> 1:53:54.982

your loved one,</i>

1:53:54.983 --> 1:53:59.291
