WEBVTT

00:52.010 --> 00:53.701
What are we gonna do now?

00:55.389 --> 00:56.975
I'll think of something.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.969
- What's funny?
- Russ didn't tell you?

01:02.980 --> 01:05.637
He told me about the job,
but he didn't tell me anything funny.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.558
- He didn't tell you about Pete?
- No. Who's Pete?

01:09.319 --> 01:15.186
Well, it seems that this physician-type
character named Pete was all depressed one day.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.193
He felt terrible 'cause he did some
stuff he just couldn't get over.

01:18.412 --> 01:22.452
- What did he do?
- He slept with five of his patients.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.623
But Pete wasn't the worst
guy in the universe,

01:25.002 --> 01:28.370
because no matter how hard he tried
to forget about it, he couldn't.

01:28.755 --> 01:32.794
The guilt and sense of
unprofessionalism was overwhelming.

01:33.010 --> 01:35.002
But every once in a while
he'd hear a voice inside

01:35.220 --> 01:37.553
that said, "Pete, don't worry about it.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.707
You weren't the first licensed practitioner
to sleep with one of your patients

01:40.726 --> 01:42.183
and you won't be the last.

01:42.394 --> 01:44.101
Besides, you're single.

01:44.313 --> 01:45.645
Let it go."

01:45.856 --> 01:49.099
But then, just when he almost
over the guilt with it all,

01:49.318 --> 01:51.905
another voice would bring
him back down to reality.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.777
And say, "Oh Pete,

01:53.989 --> 01:55.150
But dude,

01:55.365 --> 01:56.856
you're a veterinarian!"

03:51.064 --> 03:52.220
Vi!

03:52.399 --> 03:53.555
Let's go!

03:55.318 --> 03:56.559
Wha-What are you doing?

04:14.337 --> 04:16.579
- I don't get it.
- Don't get what?

04:16.798 --> 04:20.015
What's so funny about the vegetarian man?
I don't get it.

04:20.218 --> 04:24.658
- You mean the veterinarian man?
- Yeah, that guy. I don't get it.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.593
He sleeps with his patients.

04:26.808 --> 04:31.348
His patients are probably cats and dogs
and llamas and stuff.

04:31.605 --> 04:35.940
Why is that funny?
Back home we had puppy dogs and kitty cats

04:36.109 --> 04:38.977
I used to nap with all the time.
I think it's sweet.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.855
Actually, don't worry about it, partner.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.633
There are plenty of other jokes
in the universe we can share.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.502
Let's just get ready for tonight.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.612
Some well deserved vacation.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.743
- I got a good one for you, Violet.
- Lay it on me!

04:52.000 --> 04:53.056
Oh, dang!

04:53.126 --> 04:55.118
- What?
- I think I forgot it.

04:56.004 --> 04:59.964
Well that's the good thing, Daze.
I'll be here if it comes back to you

05:04.262 --> 05:07.130
Ten, Nine, Eight.

05:07.599 --> 05:08.555
seven,

05:08.934 --> 05:09.970
six,

05:10.310 --> 05:11.016
five,

05:11.353 --> 05:12.013
four,

05:12.395 --> 05:13.181
three,

05:13.605 --> 05:14.345
two,

05:14.773 --> 05:15.729
one!

05:27.285 --> 05:28.571
What happened over there?

05:30.080 --> 05:31.036
Well...

05:32.165 --> 05:35.733
I was just thinkin' that,
since how you're 18 and all,

05:35.752 --> 05:39.220
you can be charged as an adult now,
for all felonies.

05:39.381 --> 05:42.965
Kid's meals, ferris wheels...
God knows what else.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.089
I know.

05:49.891 --> 05:53.180
But hey, this should turn that
frown around.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.970
I've invited Boss to our party.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.414
It was swell of you
to invite him.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.417
Hello?
Oh, hey Russ.

07:00.629 --> 07:03.071
Is that Russ calling to
wish us a happy vacation?

07:03.089 --> 07:05.581
Because if he's not,
he's got a wrong number.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.056
- Uh...
- Biatch.

07:07.135 --> 07:09.718
I don't know.
I'll have to check with Violet.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.637
- Vi?
- No fucking way.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.556
- Violet says no.
- Violet says fuck no!

07:14.768 --> 07:17.260
I thought you said we had
some down time ahead.

07:19.147 --> 07:22.231
No, Violet told me you'd pull
something like this.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.109
Oh, yep, no kidding.
She said you'd do that too.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.770
Up the money and
call it an easy gig.

07:27.989 --> 07:31.132
That's textbook, Russ!
What you think we are, stupid?

07:31.660 --> 07:33.371
Yeah! Same to you!

07:34.162 --> 07:37.200
- Can you believe him?
- Lookie here, Daze.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.961
Barbie Sunday has a new fashion line.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.706
"Be your best in my
new signature dress.

07:42.921 --> 07:46.221
Let them know you mean business
at the disco or in the boardroom,

07:46.257 --> 07:49.170
with the amazing versatility
of the premiere piece,

07:49.344 --> 07:52.587
in my high-end line,
of super stylish couture.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.563
Who's better than you girl?"

07:54.808 --> 07:56.640
Oh man!

07:57.852 --> 07:59.969
- How much is it?
- Around 300 bucks.

08:00.105 --> 08:03.719
- How do you know?
- I know because Stacy Culpepper's got one,

08:03.733 --> 08:06.400
and everybody was talking about it.
Let's get ours.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.645
- We can't.
- Why not?

08:08.822 --> 08:11.155
Because we blew the
money on rent again.

08:12.742 --> 08:16.702
Still, we might still have enough
for just one dress and then maybe...

08:16.913 --> 08:18.069
What?

08:19.165 --> 08:20.381
Again, Vi?

08:23.169 --> 08:25.782
Call Russ back before
he gives the job away.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.379
- We gotta.
- But...

08:27.632 --> 08:29.669
He said it was an easy gig, right?

08:29.884 --> 08:32.542
- Yeah.
- Upped the money too, didn't he?

08:33.054 --> 08:34.210
Yeah.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.837
Then what are we waiting for?

08:38.893 --> 08:40.384
That's the shit!

08:40.645 --> 08:43.183
Hey Russ, it's me, Daisy.
I know what we said,

08:43.398 --> 08:47.733
but we've changed our minds and we've,
um, reconsidered your offer.

08:47.902 --> 08:51.862
And we think that actually it
would work out quite well because, um...

08:52.073 --> 08:54.736
See,the day that you talked about,
we can work it.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.622
Mmm... deeper, baby, deeper...

09:02.000 --> 09:04.788
Ow, gross!
You weren't suppose to like it!

09:05.170 --> 09:07.878
"Like" had nothing to do with it, princess.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.772
Now you guys heard about this guy?

09:11.301 --> 09:15.015
Okay, so basically there was this guy
that stole some shit from Chet.

09:15.096 --> 09:18.209
- What did this guy take from him?
- A truck full of cologne.

09:18.349 --> 09:21.217
Now, this truck contains somethin'
in addition to just cologne.

09:21.436 --> 09:24.149
- Somethin' like what?
- A bag full of money.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.856
The weird part is that
the guy called us up

09:26.900 --> 09:30.059
and had the stones to taunt us
after he did what he did.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.157
- Stones...
- Or some kind of a death wish.

09:32.238 --> 09:35.038
'Cause he all gave us his address.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.558
His name and number,
was clear as day

09:37.619 --> 09:39.379
the whole time he was fuckin' with us.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.788
Culpepper lives about
three blocks from this dude.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.360
She's checked him out.

09:44.375 --> 09:47.743
Says he leaves in the morning,
comes back in the afternoon.

09:48.421 --> 09:52.335
When he comes home,
you'll be waiting for him.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.048
And that's that.

09:54.302 --> 09:57.716
The landlord's on our team,
so the door will be open.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.719
- Better be.
- Relax. The door will be open.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.891
And you don't have to worry
about the noise either.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.318
- Why not?
- The building's almost empty.

10:05.396 --> 10:09.906
Switching over the condos or some
kinda gentrificational kind of shit.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.141
You sure this guy was
working alone, Russ?

10:12.153 --> 10:15.442
Pretty sure. Landlord said
the guy's a loner.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.652
This happens tomorrow.

10:18.159 --> 10:21.101
- Can you handle it?
- 'Course we can handle it.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.578
You got the specs?

10:28.128 --> 10:29.509
Now we good?

10:29.587 --> 10:31.544
Yeah, we good.

10:31.756 --> 10:32.872
Come on, Daze.

10:33.925 --> 10:36.793
Hey you guys hear about
Barbie Sunday's new dress?

10:37.011 --> 10:39.128
- Yeah we know.
- Just checkin'.

10:39.764 --> 10:40.720
Daze!

10:41.099 --> 10:42.055
Yeah?

10:42.851 --> 10:43.967
Happy Birthday!

10:44.269 --> 10:45.601
Thanks, Russ.

10:45.812 --> 10:49.372
If you keep an eye on your partner,
you might be around see your next one.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.394
Fuck off, Russ!

10:51.818 --> 10:53.750
Ask her about Rose.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.153
I said fuck off, Russ!

10:58.700 --> 10:59.941
Who's Rose?

11:00.451 --> 11:02.317
My old partner.

11:02.579 --> 11:05.196
- I thought I was your only...
- Sorry Daze.

11:05.415 --> 11:06.865
Well, what happened to her?

11:06.875 --> 11:09.262
- She died.
- How?

11:09.627 --> 11:11.869
- Got shot.
- How?

11:12.088 --> 11:13.324
Usual way.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.752
Somebody pointed a gun at her
and pulled the trigger.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.296
- Who?
- It's complicated.

11:18.553 --> 11:21.387
- Well, it all kinda make sense now.
- Why?

11:21.639 --> 11:23.705
You talked about her in
your sleep sometimes.

11:23.725 --> 11:24.781
I do?

11:25.393 --> 11:26.449
Yeah.

11:29.564 --> 11:31.601
- Vi?
- Yeah, man.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.977
I can't wait until we get the dresses.

11:33.985 --> 11:36.042
Things are gonna change for us after that.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.702
Oh, hell yeah!

12:11.022 --> 12:14.356
- Do we need to chain it up?
- Nah, this will do.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.041
- Cool?
- Cool.

13:31.894 --> 13:34.828
<i>This is really the last time,
I'm gonna say this to you.</i>

13:34.939 --> 13:36.120
<i>Okay? Or anything else.</i>

13:36.190 --> 13:39.283
<i>I don't want you to send me
anything anymore. I don't...</i>

13:39.402 --> 13:41.815
<i>I threw out those flowers.</i>

13:42.030 --> 13:44.272
<i>You can't fix it.</i>

13:44.532 --> 13:46.598
<i>And I'm really... done with you.</i>

13:46.659 --> 13:49.618
<i>I don't want talk to you again.
I don't want to hear from you again.</i>

13:49.829 --> 13:52.196
<i>I want you to leave me alone.</i>

13:52.415 --> 13:55.203
<i>Please, okay?
You don't know how to fix this.</i>

13:55.418 --> 13:57.159
<i>You can't fix it.</i>

13:57.378 --> 14:00.011
<i>You... have no clue.</i>

14:02.342 --> 14:04.229
<i>Just... leave me alone.</i>

14:04.302 --> 14:06.840
<i>I don't ever wanna hear from you again.</i>

14:22.028 --> 14:24.361
Wake me up when the latch turns.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.062
But what if...

14:26.074 --> 14:28.434
This isn't exactly the residence
of a renegade, Daze.

14:28.451 --> 14:29.325
But...

14:29.351 --> 14:32.846
Just keep a lookout while
I go and dream about a dress.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.170
Oh my God!
Is that the guy?

16:32.617 --> 16:35.150
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.549
- Why didn't he take our guns or nothin'?
- I don't know.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.791
- Should we wake him up or just pop him?
- I don't know Daze.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.716
Hey, girls.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.397
There's stuff in the kitchen
if you're hungry.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.724
- Do you know why we're here?
- Yes, I've been expecting you.

17:03.606 --> 17:06.644
I think there must be some
sort of misunderstanding.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.521
We're not here to clean
your bathtub, or...

17:09.737 --> 17:12.605
organize your closets,
or make you happy.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.147
Really?

17:14.367 --> 17:15.653
Yeah.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.326
We're here to kill you.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.800
Then there's no misunderstanding at all.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.085
Do you mind if I have
a word with my partner?

17:31.425 --> 17:33.657
Wait a sec.
Search him, Daze.

17:56.284 --> 17:57.616
He's clean, Vi.

17:59.996 --> 18:00.952
Come on then.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.808
- This isn't go much like we pictured it, Vi.
- Yeah, I know.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.094
I just wish it more like a normal job.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.755
Now it's weird.

18:20.016 --> 18:22.217
I never really talked to a job before.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.434
This might be some kind of test.

18:24.687 --> 18:26.995
Everything's a test
when you're a career woman.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.555
Damn right.

18:28.774 --> 18:31.858
And those dresses aren't gonna
buy themselves.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.493
- I got it!
- What?

18:34.519 --> 18:36.163
- I know we could do!
- What?

18:36.324 --> 18:39.041
Why don't we just go in there,
blasting without thinking about it?

18:39.160 --> 18:40.896
That way,
we won't have to think about it.

18:40.911 --> 18:44.371
We don't even have to look either, because
we're never gonna miss it that distance.

18:44.373 --> 18:47.065
It's a good plan, Daze.
A real good one!

18:47.084 --> 18:48.625
- You think so?
- Totally.

18:48.711 --> 18:49.867
Cool.

18:49.879 --> 18:52.036
- But don't aim too high.
- Why not?

18:52.048 --> 18:53.539
We don't want to hit that little bird.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.981
Oh, yeah. Good thinkin'.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.658
Okay, ready?

18:57.928 --> 19:00.085
- Ready.
- Let's do it!

19:18.366 --> 19:19.948
Who wants a snack?

19:21.285 --> 19:23.326
Be careful they're hot.

19:25.081 --> 19:26.997
Um... no thank you.

19:27.083 --> 19:30.266
- Don't you like cookies?
- Yeah, but...

19:30.419 --> 19:32.702
I feel kind of bad now.

19:33.381 --> 19:36.794
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Are those oatmeal?

19:42.640 --> 19:43.796
Thanks, mister.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.089
What's wrong?

19:55.194 --> 19:57.556
Wait a minute,
did you put something in these?

19:58.531 --> 20:00.222
Why are you looking at us funny?

20:00.241 --> 20:02.148
No, no, no...

20:02.159 --> 20:05.026
It's just that you girls aren't
what I expected.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.162
We didn't picture you either.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.866
Keeps life interesting I guess.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.464
Do you have any milk?

20:30.438 --> 20:32.555
I hate to interrupt
or anything, but...

20:32.940 --> 20:35.147
don't you think you girls
had better reload?

20:35.985 --> 20:38.347
Excuse me, but what is your deal?

20:38.362 --> 20:39.702
I'd rather not discuss it.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.568
- Why not?
- That's my business, that's why not.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.573
What's the big...

20:44.910 --> 20:46.782
I thought for sure they'd
send professionals.

20:46.808 --> 20:47.352
They did!

20:47.371 --> 20:49.754
Then why does it matter what
I don't want to discuss?

20:49.832 --> 20:51.773
Wouldn't you be curious if you were us?

20:51.792 --> 20:53.833
There's a place around the corner
if you need more ammo.

20:53.919 --> 20:57.333
- We got ammo.
- Then let's get this show on the road.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.824
Expecting company.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.194
- What kind of company?
- I'd rather not say,

21:03.220 --> 21:05.958
except to say we probably don't
wanna be here when they arrive.

21:06.015 --> 21:08.853
- They? Who's "they"?
- Is this an interview or a hit?

21:08.934 --> 21:11.251
Whatever man.
You got anymore cookies?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.327
Maybe, maybe not.

21:14.064 --> 21:16.624
How about this? If you shoot me,
I'll tell you where they are.

21:16.817 --> 21:19.234
- And I'll throw in the recipe.
- How are you gonna do that dead?

21:19.278 --> 21:21.961
- Start shooting and find out.
- Hardy har har.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.536
Excuse me. I need to confer
with my colleague.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.510
- Again?
- Yeah, again.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.057
Don't worry. I won't move this time.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.159
I'll be right here when you get back.

21:33.250 --> 21:36.264
I know we gotta off this guy,
'cause that's what we gotta do.

21:36.279 --> 21:39.537
But I don't wanna do it until
I know why he wants us to do it.

21:39.590 --> 21:43.083
I mean, something's wrong here.
What is this, Daze?

21:45.805 --> 21:49.424
I mean a guy doesn't just up and hijack
a truck chuck full of cash and cologne

21:49.683 --> 21:52.666
to get himself rubbed out.
There are other ways.

21:54.563 --> 21:58.603
I want this guy's story, but getting it
would just make our job harder.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.179
I mean it changes everything.

22:00.194 --> 22:02.794
That's why they don't name any
of the pigs on a sausage farm.

22:03.155 --> 22:06.239
And for that reason, I don't think
we should talk to him anymore.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.158
That's gonna be tough,
He's interesting.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.696
- He sure is.
- And how about those cookies?

22:11.696 --> 22:12.696
Oh man!

22:13.082 --> 22:15.920
Have you ever had anything
like that in your whole life?

22:16.001 --> 22:18.193
If we were rich,
and didn't have to kill him,

22:18.212 --> 22:20.955
we could pay him, just to make
those cookies for us all the time.

22:21.131 --> 22:23.618
Hell, what if the cookies are
just the tip of the iceberg?

22:23.676 --> 22:25.358
What if he makes brownies?

22:25.427 --> 22:28.170
We'd get so fat,
but it'd be so worth it.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.343
Anyway, let's just like we said before.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.416
We'll just run in there blasting.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.235
- You bring anymore ammo?
- Nope.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.366
I thought you said you had some more.

22:37.392 --> 22:39.664
Nah, I just wanted to
sound pro and say I did.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.853
It's not like we were facing
five or six jokers

22:41.861 --> 22:43.693
who shotgunned one of Chet's nightclubs.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.776
Besides, I was tryin' to
save up for the dresses.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.030
Never got the hang of these.

22:55.749 --> 23:00.084
Unless it's high on your bucket
list I wouldn't sweat it.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.283
Where's that place again?

23:03.007 --> 23:03.775
What place?

23:03.801 --> 23:05.871
The place, where you said
we could get the bullets.

23:07.678 --> 23:09.685
I thought you had some.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.595
Well I was mistaken.

23:12.933 --> 23:14.970
I've got a pretty good steak knife.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.168
Just trying to help.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.180
You go out the front door,
you hook a right,

23:20.399 --> 23:23.216
then walk three blocks straight down.
It's on this side of the street.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.442
You can't miss it.

23:25.029 --> 23:27.391
- I'll go Daze.
- Why can't I?

23:27.406 --> 23:29.347
Because you look 12,
and I've an ID.

23:29.366 --> 23:31.028
They might actually check
in this part of town.

23:31.076 --> 23:34.114
Just keep an eye on him while I'm gone,
and remember what I said.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.486
Okay.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.997
You guys need anything?

23:40.544 --> 23:42.125
No, we're good.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.849
So how long have you two been friends?

24:06.820 --> 24:10.689
I'm not supposed to really talk
to you anymore, so...

24:21.710 --> 24:23.751
Oh, wait!
I think you got a phone message.

24:23.754 --> 24:26.262
But that's all I'm sayin'.
Now I'm gonna zip.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.387
<i>You have one new message.</i>

24:35.557 --> 24:38.500
<i>This is really the last time
I'm gonna say this to you.</i>

24:38.560 --> 24:39.841
<i>Okay? Or anything else.</i>

24:39.853 --> 24:42.946
<i>I don't want you to send me
anything anymore. I don't...</i>

24:43.023 --> 24:45.715
<i>I threw out those flowers.</i>

24:45.734 --> 24:47.942
<i>You can't fix it.</i>

24:48.153 --> 24:50.345
<i>And I'm really... done with you.</i>

24:50.364 --> 24:53.352
<i>I don't want talk to you again.
I don't want to hear from you again.</i>

24:53.367 --> 24:55.609
<i>I want you to leave me alone.</i>

25:10.217 --> 25:13.055
Me and Vi have been friends
a pretty long time.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.219
Maybe three years.

25:19.643 --> 25:20.899
What?

25:21.812 --> 25:24.896
You asked how long we've been
friends a minute ago.

25:26.275 --> 25:27.531
Oh yes...

25:28.027 --> 25:29.283
Alright.

25:31.321 --> 25:34.610
- We met in a hospital.
- In a hospital?

25:35.701 --> 25:36.891
Yeah.

25:36.910 --> 25:40.620
It was that dull hospital
over on Lexington. Know it?

25:41.415 --> 25:42.571
No.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.900
We were doctors.
I mean, surgeons.

25:46.336 --> 25:49.298
Violet tells me to say surgeons.

25:50.007 --> 25:53.751
Working in the hospital never
gave me bad dreams, that's for sure.

25:56.013 --> 25:58.551
Anyway, she's my best friend ever.

25:58.766 --> 26:01.267
I kinda worry about her sometimes though.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.641
Half the time, I wish I was more like her.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.238
And then...

26:12.237 --> 26:13.393
What?

26:17.201 --> 26:18.482
I don't know.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.681
She reminds me of my daughter.

26:26.335 --> 26:28.418
Is that her on the phone machine?

26:30.047 --> 26:31.954
But it's not important.

26:33.634 --> 26:35.000
It is, but...

26:35.761 --> 26:37.798
don't let it distract you.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.687
- What's with that?
- What's with what?

26:52.861 --> 26:54.773
The numbers you two wear.

26:55.197 --> 26:56.859
- These?
- Yes.

26:57.074 --> 26:58.631
Oh, that's our rank.

26:58.700 --> 27:02.239
Officially I'm killer number Nine
and Violet's killer number Eight.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.070
And how do you move up?

27:04.832 --> 27:07.791
Makin' hits.
Vi says it beats dead entry.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.168
Who's number one?

27:10.254 --> 27:12.095
No one's ever seen him.

27:12.673 --> 27:14.960
But he once killed three ninjas...

27:15.717 --> 27:17.528
with a fingernail file.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.338
Who's this?

27:23.350 --> 27:27.194
There's a place about two blocks up from
you. It looks like a hardware store.

27:27.312 --> 27:31.352
If it's closed, that's only
what the sign says.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.229
Hold on, hold on. I gotta take a piss.

27:46.248 --> 27:47.659
What else is it?

27:47.875 --> 27:50.835
How many time every time I take
a piss you gotta take a piss?

27:50.836 --> 27:52.378
- Not every time
- You do man. Every single damn-

27:52.379 --> 27:55.246
Every single time I gotta take
a piss, you gotta take a piss!

27:55.632 --> 27:58.670
Hey, you're not supposed to look down when
you're peeing next to another man, okay?

27:58.886 --> 28:01.078
- I'm not looking.
- You're lookin' now, and I saw you look down!

28:01.096 --> 28:03.413
- I'm lookin' at your face.
- My man, why are you looking at me all?

28:03.432 --> 28:05.878
Dude, you get me worried
about you sometimes.

28:05.904 --> 28:07.751
Don't you know pee
etiquette man?

28:10.939 --> 28:12.896
Let's hope she hurries.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.220
What's the big deal?
Who's comin' over?

28:15.235 --> 28:16.625
It's not important.

28:16.653 --> 28:20.572
It's not like I'm asking you to tell me
where you stashed that money or anything.

28:23.160 --> 28:26.119
I'm expecting company because
of something else I did.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.317
What else did you do?

28:30.167 --> 28:32.079
I robbed somebody.

28:32.294 --> 28:35.037
Somebody else that's not our boss?

28:36.173 --> 28:37.389
Yeah.

28:37.507 --> 28:38.718
Who?

28:40.010 --> 28:42.142
- Donnie Daffo.
- Oh, my...

28:43.347 --> 28:46.055
Then you really are serious
about getting yourself killed?

28:46.391 --> 28:48.883
I figure it's people who visit
me today as well.

28:49.061 --> 28:53.305
Small world, 'cause uh...
me and Vi hate those guys' guts.

28:54.191 --> 28:56.071
Two months ago Violet ran into them,

28:56.276 --> 28:58.438
and they locked her in a dumpster.

28:58.695 --> 29:01.563
It looked like someone had
taken the life out of her.

29:03.283 --> 29:05.065
Is that all they did?

29:05.077 --> 29:08.161
You mean, lock her in that trash can?

29:09.414 --> 29:12.623
Well, yeah, I mean that's all she told me.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.875
What else would they...?

29:19.841 --> 29:21.923
Russ is such an ass.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.548
Thinks he's smart,
but he's not.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.565
Nothin' to say this time?

30:03.135 --> 30:05.798
Maybe you learned your lesson after all.

30:06.430 --> 30:09.238
Well I got somethin' for
you to tell your boss.

30:09.349 --> 30:12.192
In this fuckin' economy that
chicken shit must be pretty hard up

30:12.519 --> 30:16.570
<i>to send a little cunt like you,
to do a man's job.</i>

30:18.817 --> 30:20.149
Fuck you later!

31:42.734 --> 31:45.226
- Hi.
- We're closed. What do you want?

31:46.780 --> 31:49.663
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- Yeah you do.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.158
The black door in the back.

31:53.537 --> 31:54.998
Much obliged.

32:16.017 --> 32:17.858
How can I help you?

32:23.984 --> 32:25.971
Let's go, let's go!
Come on.

32:25.986 --> 32:28.027
Move fast.
Check out those boxes right there.

32:28.071 --> 32:30.178
Let's go, move on.

32:40.625 --> 32:44.189
"But dude!
You're a vegetarian!"

32:56.600 --> 32:58.456
- See?
- Oh...

33:09.571 --> 33:11.127
Nope! Slap.

33:14.659 --> 33:17.743
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war. Battle!

33:22.501 --> 33:24.008
Alright, pattycake.

33:27.797 --> 33:29.959
- No, you go first!
- No...

33:30.300 --> 33:32.542
...you do this, and then this.

33:38.058 --> 33:39.219
Hey!

33:39.643 --> 33:41.709
Look who's here?

33:41.728 --> 33:44.015
We just saw your stupid
little girlfriend.

33:44.397 --> 33:46.810
Had to tell about herself.

33:46.983 --> 33:48.949
You should see her face.

33:49.027 --> 33:52.345
Just this mornin' we had to
whack out a couple clowns.

33:53.323 --> 33:55.781
Yeah, we took our time doin' it too.

33:55.992 --> 33:59.235
Your stupid little girlfriend looks scareder
than both those faggots put together.

34:00.247 --> 34:02.539
Even when things were
gettin' ugly for them.

34:02.624 --> 34:04.735
Step aside jailbait!

34:08.672 --> 34:11.790
Or don't... if you wanna be a tough guy
and see what happens to you.

34:12.007 --> 34:14.815
Do it.
Do as they say, Daisy.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.963
Can I ask you fellas something?

34:22.310 --> 34:24.251
- Nah, forget it.
- Come on.

34:24.813 --> 34:26.149
Excuse me?

34:28.900 --> 34:29.856
Please.

34:30.985 --> 34:33.103
- Everybody!
- Please.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.192
Very good!

34:35.407 --> 34:38.024
But I won't get into it until
you holster the hardware!

34:38.409 --> 34:40.522
- Why would we do that?
- So you don't get tired.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.359
- What do you think we are, stupid?
- Off course I think you're stupid.

34:43.415 --> 34:44.856
That's the point.

34:44.873 --> 34:48.158
You're gonna have enough trouble keepin' up
with what I'm gonna tell you as it is.

34:48.168 --> 34:52.664
If you're tuckered out too,
we'll be wasting everybody's time.

34:52.882 --> 34:55.482
You don't want mama's good
wisdom going to waste, do you?

34:56.136 --> 34:59.438
Heck, I'd be surprised if
your arms aren't burnin' already

34:59.439 --> 35:01.580
from keeping us at gun point so long.

35:01.641 --> 35:05.351
I mean, it's not like we're packing
or anything. What are you afraid of?

35:15.530 --> 35:17.246
That better?

35:21.911 --> 35:24.979
- Alright, where was I?
- You were gonna ask us something.

35:25.165 --> 35:27.056
Oh, that's right!
Thanks!

35:27.667 --> 35:29.328
Okay. So... here it goes.

35:29.628 --> 35:33.767
My partner weighs in
at about 95 pounds, right?

35:34.382 --> 35:37.966
And together you guys are pushing
half a ton, give or take, correct?

35:40.221 --> 35:45.416
So... did you need much help
stuffing her in that garbage can?

35:50.023 --> 35:51.179
Now...

35:51.900 --> 35:55.064
I usually don't talk to people
like you in the first place,

35:55.278 --> 35:57.561
but... if I did that sort of thing,

35:57.614 --> 36:00.181
I would say that you girls
should have your own TV show.

36:00.200 --> 36:03.659
And that you should call that program
"The Adventures of Donnie's Bitches".

36:03.870 --> 36:05.251
But like I said at the top,

36:05.288 --> 36:08.281
I usually don't talk to people like you.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.538
Because talkin' to people like you
doesn't make much sense.

36:11.920 --> 36:15.208
What do you mean,
"People like us"?

36:15.924 --> 36:17.790
What the hell kind of people are we?

36:21.763 --> 36:22.970
Dead ones.

36:24.224 --> 36:25.485
What?

36:39.364 --> 36:43.628
Found some bullets,
but now I might be out again.

36:45.870 --> 36:49.534
I don't know about you partner...
I think I'm hearin' somethin'.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.457
Something like what?

36:54.045 --> 36:55.927
The internal bleeding dance!

36:56.798 --> 36:59.962
- I could sure use some help too.
- You got it, partner!

37:08.309 --> 37:11.302
- Move! I want the fat one!
- They're all fat, biatch!

37:14.065 --> 37:15.221
Say mister,

37:15.233 --> 37:17.841
you got any other leads on where
I can get some more bullets?

37:17.861 --> 37:20.348
That other place got turned into
a crime scene. Long story.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.446
Just do some thinkin' on it, okay?

37:28.246 --> 37:30.463
Are you expectin' anybody else?

37:30.749 --> 37:32.340
Are you sure?

37:34.335 --> 37:36.201
It might be backup for Donnie's crew.

37:36.421 --> 37:38.262
Maybe they're supposed to call in.
You know, like we do.

37:38.339 --> 37:40.819
Well why didn't they just come
right in. Everybody else has?

37:41.593 --> 37:44.677
I don't know. Whoever the hell it is,
I'm out of bullets again.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.050
I'll get it.

37:59.068 --> 38:01.760
What? Wait but...
what if Donnie's other guys?

38:01.905 --> 38:04.413
- I know what they'll do.
- I thought you wanted us to kill you.

38:04.449 --> 38:05.805
You jealous?

38:06.326 --> 38:09.694
- Kinda.
- Now take the fire escape. I'll stall.

38:09.913 --> 38:12.753
Otherwise they're gonna kill us all
after they see what happened in here.

38:13.374 --> 38:14.630
Go!

38:15.168 --> 38:18.002
- Well you should come too!
- No. No I shouldn't.

38:18.213 --> 38:20.825
This way I'll buy you some time.
Go!

38:21.591 --> 38:22.897
Please.

38:23.593 --> 38:25.449
Go! Go!

38:29.307 --> 38:31.845
Everything okay in there?
I thought I heard something.

38:32.185 --> 38:34.302
It's fine... Dolores.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.237
- How have you been?
- I thought I heard something.

38:37.273 --> 38:40.666
You know, I did too. Sounded like it
was coming from upstairs again.

38:40.693 --> 38:42.730
I was sure it was coming
from here.

38:43.655 --> 38:46.672
- Did you try next door?
- Are you sure everything's okay in there?

38:46.699 --> 38:47.940
Yes.

38:48.117 --> 38:50.450
I really should go now, Dolores.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.556
You take care.

38:55.875 --> 38:57.241
- Well ain't...
- Dolores!

38:57.627 --> 38:58.583
Dolores...

39:00.505 --> 39:01.821
Take care.

39:59.981 --> 40:01.647
Okay, you ready? Go!

40:09.365 --> 40:11.477
115th precinct,
Officer Minocha speaking.

40:11.534 --> 40:14.447
There's something wrong in the apartment
down the hall from me.

40:47.070 --> 40:49.653
We're gonna have to take care
of him too, you know.

40:49.822 --> 40:51.078
I know.

40:51.824 --> 40:54.567
- I think we should do it now.
- Why?

40:55.328 --> 40:57.991
He's sleeping.
It'll be merciful.

40:59.332 --> 41:01.449
Ah, I thought we were
outta bullets again.

41:01.834 --> 41:05.348
We are, but I can run out and go
get some more somewhere real quick.

41:05.421 --> 41:08.296
We couldn't even do it now
even if we had the bullets.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.866
- Why not?
- I don't know.

41:10.885 --> 41:13.468
He said,
he wanted to see it coming.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.621
- When?
- While you're out.

41:15.682 --> 41:18.390
- Well did he say anything else?
- Like what?

41:18.643 --> 41:20.750
Like, why he wants to check out so bad?

41:21.187 --> 41:23.624
- A little.
- Well?

41:25.024 --> 41:27.361
He's.... got bad cancer.

41:27.443 --> 41:30.402
It's in my pancreas and spreading.

41:32.407 --> 41:35.400
I'm going to die and I'd rather
not take the scenic route.

41:36.661 --> 41:40.701
I don't think he has anybody who loves
him either, which must be even worse.

41:43.401 --> 41:45.488
We should think about
going to his funeral.

41:45.570 --> 41:47.832
You know, just so there's someone there.

41:49.882 --> 41:51.238
What?

41:51.426 --> 41:52.186
What?!

41:52.260 --> 41:54.968
At the end of the day, Donnie'll
send the survivin' members

41:55.263 --> 41:56.920
of his squad to finish
the job either way.

41:56.931 --> 41:59.844
So if it's not us doin' this,
it'll be somebody else.

42:00.184 --> 42:02.100
And besides, this guy's dead already!

42:02.145 --> 42:04.707
In fact, it's way better if
we're the ones to do it.

42:04.731 --> 42:06.643
Because unlike Donnie's punks,

42:06.858 --> 42:09.976
we're not gonna torture him
for eight or nine hours first.

42:11.154 --> 42:13.241
Did you hear somethin'?

42:28.129 --> 42:31.713
What happened to you anyway?
You look a little mussed up.

42:31.924 --> 42:33.490
What's with the heat shield?

42:33.718 --> 42:35.050
- This?
- Yeah.

42:35.845 --> 42:37.139
I've been deputized.

42:37.165 --> 42:39.363
- I'm serious, Vi.
- Fine!

42:40.266 --> 42:42.987
I had a little incident while
I was out getting the bullets.

42:43.019 --> 42:46.027
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- Are you interested?

42:46.064 --> 42:47.329
Always.

42:48.357 --> 42:50.019
So the second I get the lead,

42:50.234 --> 42:53.693
three desperados stormed in
and hold up the spot.

42:53.863 --> 42:57.956
First I'm thinking, I'm just gonna lay
low in aisle three and let this shit be.

42:58.993 --> 43:00.950
Then, one of them sees me

43:01.162 --> 43:03.779
and gets the bright idea
that they should rob me too.

43:03.998 --> 43:07.366
So I proceeded to inform
the perp and his pals

43:07.585 --> 43:10.146
of the multiple ways in which they
might violated their mothers.

43:10.630 --> 43:13.550
So while they're trying to
figure out where I got the balls,

43:14.550 --> 43:15.836
the cops show up.

43:16.052 --> 43:18.135
Was it because the place
had a silent alarm?

43:18.304 --> 43:19.415
No.

43:19.430 --> 43:21.591
Was it because the cops just got lucky?

43:21.641 --> 43:22.797
Hell, no!

43:22.809 --> 43:27.099
This place is a stone's throw
from the 115th precinct.

43:27.313 --> 43:29.553
So the minute I
remembered that little detail,

43:29.732 --> 43:31.598
I'm thinking one of two things:

43:31.984 --> 43:35.777
These desperados are either
stupid, or crazy as all hell.

43:35.822 --> 43:38.790
Whatever the case, the cops
apprehend the whole crew,

43:38.866 --> 43:41.666
and then one of the fuzzy-wuzzies
asks me if I'm okay.

43:41.744 --> 43:43.360
So I said, "Officer,

43:43.579 --> 43:45.241
how do you know I wasn't in on it?

43:45.456 --> 43:48.745
What makes you think
a girl can't be in on it?"

43:49.127 --> 43:50.984
Next thing I hear is...

43:51.003 --> 43:52.384
Bang, bang, bang!

43:52.421 --> 43:55.710
The guy behind the register flips
and starts shooting at the perps.

43:55.925 --> 43:58.963
It seems he had a gun beneath the
counter took the robbery personally.

43:59.137 --> 44:00.173
Long story short,

44:00.388 --> 44:02.675
just about everybody ended
up taking a slug or two,

44:02.890 --> 44:05.098
except for yours truly.

44:05.268 --> 44:07.760
That's how I got this one's shield on me.

44:08.020 --> 44:12.060
It was blasted off a porker and
just landed there. Scout's honor.

44:12.441 --> 44:14.649
Anyway, right about then,
I thought it may be prudent

44:14.861 --> 44:17.353
to exit the premises through the rear.

44:18.030 --> 44:21.068
Some days, you just can't get
a bullet to save your life.

44:21.284 --> 44:23.271
And here of all places.

44:23.286 --> 44:26.245
I mean, shit, this is America right?

44:26.455 --> 44:28.492
But, how'd you get so dirty?

44:29.750 --> 44:33.243
I slipped on banana peel in
the alleyway comin' back.

44:33.421 --> 44:35.663
Let's go see about those dresses.

44:49.562 --> 44:50.973
How are you girls holding up?

44:51.856 --> 44:52.981
Fine.

44:52.982 --> 44:56.191
Fine. We're out of bullets again though.

44:56.402 --> 44:59.440
Why don't you use one of those guy's guns?

44:59.697 --> 45:01.359
They seem to have plenty.

45:02.992 --> 45:05.349
Why the hell didn't I think of that?

45:26.682 --> 45:28.594
These guys got everything Daze!

45:29.852 --> 45:33.311
Even a little Glock for your purse.
You know the blue one?

45:35.149 --> 45:37.261
It's like Christmas!

45:38.027 --> 45:40.235
I got you...
Sucker!

45:49.247 --> 45:51.079
Take your pick mister.

45:52.708 --> 45:54.449
Why don't you decide?

45:54.669 --> 45:56.410
Okay, let's see...

46:00.633 --> 46:03.195
I'm gonna go with a .38, Daze.

46:03.719 --> 46:05.801
Alright, are you ready mister?

46:24.073 --> 46:25.229
Sure.

46:28.369 --> 46:30.936
Okay.
Here goes nothin'.

46:30.997 --> 46:32.738
Hardy har har.

46:34.333 --> 46:35.589
What?

46:36.460 --> 46:38.326
Are you done yet?

46:39.046 --> 46:40.602
Come again?

46:40.798 --> 46:42.960
I said, "Are you done yet?"

46:43.175 --> 46:44.325
What are you talking about?

46:44.343 --> 46:47.086
You weren't seriously
gonna do it, were you?

46:47.263 --> 46:49.429
I most certainly was.

46:49.890 --> 46:51.706
With that piece?

46:52.018 --> 46:53.374
Yeah.

46:55.187 --> 46:57.727
- Suit yourself.
- Well why shouldn't I?

46:58.649 --> 47:00.311
It's unprofessional.

47:00.568 --> 47:01.824
How's that?

47:04.071 --> 47:05.327
Forensics.

47:05.406 --> 47:07.117
- Forensics?
- Yeah.

47:07.199 --> 47:09.566
Forensics. Ballistics.

47:10.328 --> 47:11.785
There's a real good chance

47:11.996 --> 47:15.255
those dorks would foul everything
up for us if we do it like this.

47:15.333 --> 47:17.450
I mean Donnie's guys can
even wind up with the credit

47:17.668 --> 47:19.068
if they traced the gun and...

47:19.128 --> 47:21.728
boss'll try to weasel out of payin' us.

47:21.881 --> 47:25.295
Even worse, we might get
blamed for every corpse in here.

47:25.509 --> 47:29.002
And boss'd chaft us to the hilt on
account of unnecessary roughness.

47:29.180 --> 47:32.514
Not to mention the gang war
we might've already started.

47:32.725 --> 47:34.967
And it's not even like
we can switch out the bullets,

47:35.144 --> 47:38.433
because the calibers won't begin
to match the ones on our stylin' rods.

47:38.689 --> 47:43.208
So, like I said, you can do it
your way if you want to, but...

47:43.819 --> 47:47.233
We risk looking on professional
and getting screwed...

47:47.448 --> 47:49.314
out of a couple of hot dresses.

48:21.690 --> 48:25.024
Good thinkin', Daze.
Forensics will fuck you.

48:25.403 --> 48:27.770
You would've thought of it too, Vi.

48:27.988 --> 48:31.577
- Yeah, maybe.
- I need a smoke.

48:32.368 --> 48:33.824
You do that?

48:34.370 --> 48:36.327
When did you start doin' that?

48:36.580 --> 48:37.936
I don't know.

48:38.749 --> 48:40.936
Where did you get those?

48:41.502 --> 48:42.959
Off one of those guys.

48:44.505 --> 48:46.479
You mind if I smoke
in your place, mister?

48:46.505 --> 48:47.372
Yeah.

48:48.551 --> 48:51.810
- Yeah you mind or yeah it's okay?
- Yeah, I mind.

48:52.805 --> 48:55.488
Actually, do what you like.

48:56.767 --> 48:58.383
It doesn't matter anyway.

49:00.896 --> 49:02.933
I'll take it out to the stairs.

49:03.899 --> 49:07.019
Oh and Violet, you might wanna
wipe your prints off those pieces.

49:07.069 --> 49:09.085
Put 'em back on the fellas.

49:10.030 --> 49:12.267
Sounds good, Daze.

49:24.170 --> 49:26.306
Come on sit down.
I wanna show you something.

49:30.092 --> 49:33.353
You know you'd probably a millionaire
if you cleaned your ears out more often.

49:33.429 --> 49:34.610
Nuh-uh!

49:36.182 --> 49:37.363
Here.

49:38.684 --> 49:40.720
Now what were you going to tell me?

49:41.520 --> 49:43.136
You had a secret...

49:43.355 --> 49:45.142
you were going to tell me.

50:10.007 --> 50:11.714
Can I ask you somethin'?

50:13.010 --> 50:15.172
Why is she so mad at you?

50:15.346 --> 50:19.135
- She's your friend, you tell me.
- I'm not talking about Violet!

50:24.230 --> 50:27.468
- She blames me for something.
- For what?

50:28.317 --> 50:31.334
- Her mother's death.
- Why, did you kill her?

50:33.072 --> 50:37.036
No, no.
She died after she left me.

50:37.117 --> 50:41.231
- Well why did she leave you?
- She didn't love me.

50:41.413 --> 50:44.606
- Why didn't she love you?
- I don't know, Daisy.

50:44.625 --> 50:48.039
I don't think people have a lot of
control over that sort of thing.

50:50.756 --> 50:54.340
As a husband I wasn't
much a prize anyway.

50:54.593 --> 50:58.177
Whatever the case,
she... fell in love with someone else.

50:59.557 --> 51:00.813
Who?

51:02.268 --> 51:05.136
A man she used to work with.
I didn't know him.

51:05.563 --> 51:07.896
I only saw him once.

51:09.275 --> 51:10.665
From a distance.

51:15.072 --> 51:17.059
They died in a car accident.

51:19.076 --> 51:21.944
How does your daughter
figure that's your fault?

51:23.289 --> 51:26.407
Well, my daughter didn't
know about the affair.

51:26.792 --> 51:29.325
She blamed me for the breakup,

51:29.336 --> 51:32.620
and consequently the... car accident.

51:32.840 --> 51:35.628
Well... did you ever
tell her the whole story?

51:36.010 --> 51:37.742
- No.
- Why not?

51:39.805 --> 51:43.348
Because I want her to remember
her mother the way she does now.

51:43.392 --> 51:45.884
That's stupid!
You're stupid!

51:46.228 --> 51:48.311
- Thank you.
- Does your daughter like Barbie Sunday?

51:48.731 --> 51:51.564
- What?
- Does your daughter like Barbie Sunday?

51:53.235 --> 51:54.391
Very much.

51:55.696 --> 51:58.258
Well, at least you did somethin' right.

51:59.992 --> 52:03.281
Now, I'm gonna get some bullets
and be done with all this.

52:03.537 --> 52:05.048
Tell Violet.

53:13.023 --> 53:15.310
You like my partner, don't you?

53:15.567 --> 53:18.935
What's not to like?
She's.... a sweet girl.

53:20.531 --> 53:22.793
Do you like her better than me?

53:23.242 --> 53:25.434
I don't know you as well.

53:25.786 --> 53:27.067
That's okay.

53:27.454 --> 53:30.117
I'd like her better than me too.
She might even

53:30.332 --> 53:34.271
think she can keep you alive
for some silly reason. Kids...

53:39.299 --> 53:41.999
- May I ask you a question, Violet?
- You may ask.

53:42.261 --> 53:44.548
Do you ever miss the Doll hospital?

53:48.225 --> 53:49.591
Not particularly.

53:50.436 --> 53:52.894
And I think I know what
you're driving at, mister.

53:53.063 --> 53:55.143
But this job never got to me,

53:55.315 --> 53:57.853
aside from the sensational
rush of the action.

53:58.068 --> 54:00.776
- What about those men?
- What men?

54:01.447 --> 54:03.309
The ones you killed.

54:03.323 --> 54:06.066
That, was fucking magical.

54:06.285 --> 54:07.821
Did you see that?

54:08.537 --> 54:11.120
It's a bit early to know,
but career-wise...

54:11.331 --> 54:14.290
that little miracle might be my Mona Lisa.

54:14.501 --> 54:16.117
If not my Billie Jean.

54:17.129 --> 54:19.170
- Actually...
- Do you have any family?

54:19.256 --> 54:20.542
What?

54:20.758 --> 54:22.324
Do you have any family?

54:25.137 --> 54:28.505
- What a random question.
- Well, do you?

54:29.892 --> 54:31.554
Daisy's like family.

54:32.811 --> 54:34.768
You didn't answer the question.

54:36.190 --> 54:39.524
I got a father somewhere.
What's with the interview?

54:39.735 --> 54:41.576
When's the last time you and he spoke?

54:41.653 --> 54:44.712
- What do you care?
- That long huh?

54:50.788 --> 54:54.322
- Are you afraid of what's next?
- Me getting shot?

54:54.500 --> 54:56.257
I mean after that.

54:56.585 --> 54:58.717
I've thought about it.

54:58.879 --> 55:00.035
And?

55:01.673 --> 55:04.586
I haven't come up with anything conclusive.

55:06.345 --> 55:09.304
I'm not an expert or anything,
but I have a theory.

55:09.556 --> 55:10.812
Yeah?

55:12.017 --> 55:13.349
I figure...

55:14.353 --> 55:17.972
I figure heaven...
is probably a place where...

55:19.274 --> 55:22.767
nobody cares how big or small you are,
or what you look like.

55:23.695 --> 55:26.358
People probably don't even have bodies.

55:27.783 --> 55:31.743
They're just maybe like...
essences or something.

55:31.995 --> 55:35.313
But if they do have bodies,
everyone's gotta be naked for sure,

55:35.332 --> 55:38.775
'cause that's we all showed up
here in the first place, right?

55:38.794 --> 55:41.958
And also, if you have a back problem,

55:42.130 --> 55:44.964
or bad knees or self-esteem issues,

55:45.175 --> 55:47.913
that stuff wouldn't bother
you anymore up there.

55:49.179 --> 55:51.341
And everything's free too.

55:51.598 --> 55:53.339
Or at least whole sale.

55:54.142 --> 55:57.260
I don't know if there are animals,
but that would be cool.

56:00.774 --> 56:01.935
Oh yeah,

56:02.109 --> 56:05.773
and when you walkin' in through
the gates for the very first time.

56:05.988 --> 56:09.572
They're probably playin' that
Louis Armstrong song.

56:09.741 --> 56:11.653
Somethin' nice like that.

56:14.663 --> 56:16.783
Part of it came from this girl I knew.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.296
She died.

56:19.084 --> 56:21.327
It's a long story.

56:21.345 --> 56:24.428
Anyway, she thought everybody
would be naked. That part was her idea.

56:26.008 --> 56:28.700
- How did she die?
- I don't wanna talk about it!

56:29.136 --> 56:31.753
I mean, I do but...

56:32.014 --> 56:34.506
when I try it never works.

56:35.225 --> 56:37.112
Maybe someday.

56:50.157 --> 56:51.193
Wow!

56:51.909 --> 56:53.400
Sit up.

57:04.379 --> 57:06.240
<i>Who wants some snack?</i>

57:06.340 --> 57:07.876
You know what?

57:08.508 --> 57:09.519
Wow!

57:10.135 --> 57:11.416
What?

57:11.637 --> 57:13.629
I don't think there are enough holes here,

57:13.847 --> 57:16.590
from that first time me and Daisy
came out blastin'.

57:16.808 --> 57:18.049
Is that important?

57:18.226 --> 57:19.382
Could be.

57:19.394 --> 57:23.354
In any case I have a feeling that my
partner's not exactly holdin' up her end.

57:23.774 --> 57:25.356
I've never...

57:25.609 --> 57:27.316
actually...

57:27.569 --> 57:29.982
really ever killed anybody.

57:30.197 --> 57:32.029
I've been using blanks.

57:34.910 --> 57:37.697
I just make sure me and Violet
don't share ammunition.

57:40.374 --> 57:43.792
Like I said, she's so fierce
and thorough on the job.

57:43.877 --> 57:46.598
I could pack a squirt gun.
It just wouldn't matter.

57:48.006 --> 57:50.168
How do you mean,
"holding up her end?"

57:51.009 --> 57:53.877
I mean that I might be the
only one takin' out the trash.

57:54.096 --> 57:58.373
- Means it looks like she's been packin' blanks.
- So what?

57:58.600 --> 58:01.187
- So what?!
- Yeah, so what?

58:01.228 --> 58:04.429
Even if she isn't taking people out,
isn't it better that she's with you?

58:05.065 --> 58:07.557
Do you think your opponent's having
two targets instead of one

58:07.776 --> 58:09.938
might've saved your behind a time or two?

58:10.153 --> 58:13.567
Do you understand, she's
risking her life as well?

58:13.907 --> 58:18.867
Do you think your friendship
might've helped keep you sane...

58:19.079 --> 58:23.118
- as you wander through this life of yours?
- There is still the principle.

58:24.918 --> 58:27.001
We have rules and
what she may have been doin'

58:27.212 --> 58:30.125
is a big no-no,
no matter how you slice it.

58:30.340 --> 58:34.084
'Cause one day you're packin' blanks
and the next you're wearin' a wire.

58:36.138 --> 58:38.300
So what are you going to do about it?

58:41.518 --> 58:44.977
I'm gonna have to take her out,
if my suspicion is true.

58:48.150 --> 58:50.767
I thought Daisy was your friend.

58:51.361 --> 58:53.223
I'm not sayin' I'm gonna like it.

58:53.238 --> 58:55.630
I thought you said she was like family?

58:55.657 --> 58:56.713
She is.

58:56.783 --> 58:59.526
But she's a business woman too,
so she'll understand.

58:59.703 --> 59:01.864
I always figured she'd
check out first anyway.

59:01.872 --> 59:03.131
Why?

59:03.132 --> 59:05.131
'Cause that's how it usually
goes for the good ones.

59:07.252 --> 59:08.863
You got a hair dryer?

59:42.579 --> 59:44.195
<i>Unit 42, come in.</i>

59:47.626 --> 59:50.710
<i>Unit 42,
respond to dispatch.</i>

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:25.258
You just missed her.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:27.802
- Daze?
- She just left.

01:01:27.934 --> 01:01:29.090
Who?

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:30.767
Rose.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.317
- Was she alive?
- I don't know.

01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:36.561
But she asked about you.

01:01:37.277 --> 01:01:38.788
What did she say?

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:41.605
She said:
"I'm looking for your partner."

01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:43.693
Those were her exact words.

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:46.551
- Is that all she said?
- No.

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:51.748
She said that roses were dead,
and violets were too.

01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:55.121
She's split after that
and that was the end of it.

01:01:55.837 --> 01:01:57.928
How long have you been here?

01:01:58.006 --> 01:02:00.293
She's taller than I thought.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.963
How long have you been here, Daze?

01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:06.271
I can't really tell.

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:09.097
Time is bent up now,
so I don't know.

01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:11.346
I keep missing my flights.

01:02:13.271 --> 01:02:14.527
What's that?

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:17.155
Oh, that?

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:20.233
That's his.
The guy's.

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:24.621
Rose is back.

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:36.499
Hello, Number 9.

01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:40.703
Oh my!

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:42.680
Are you...?

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:49.154
Wow!

01:02:49.224 --> 01:02:53.343
- I always figured you were...
- You always figured I was what?

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.170
Imaginary.

01:02:56.815 --> 01:02:58.256
Or a boy.

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:00.970
Do you know what I've been doing today?

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.603
I've been watching you and your partner.

01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:05.230
<i>Did you hear somethin'?</i>

01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:12.282
That partner of yours is
clean out of her mind.

01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:15.282
And she's gonna put us all
in a real bad spot.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.412
And we can't let that happen.

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.789
I can't let that happen.

01:03:20.005 --> 01:03:22.839
I won't let that happen.

01:03:24.009 --> 01:03:28.049
Do you even know what grief her
little slaughter is gonna cost us?

01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:31.179
Well, I'll tell you.

01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:34.509
Two of the idiots that she
ventilated were engaged.

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:37.137
Do you know who they were gonna marry?

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:40.823
The Police Chief's stepdaughters.

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:44.160
And you can bet the house that
once they sort out all these rubbish

01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:46.232
Boss is gonna be held accountable.

01:03:46.448 --> 01:03:51.318
Next to that, a garden variety
gang war would be a Sunday stroll.

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:56.405
- There was a dead guy at the bottom of the steps.
- He saw me!

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:05.847
Can I ask you a question, ma'am?

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:09.739
Do you always work by yourself?

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.470
Yes.

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:14.188
Is it lonely?

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:17.092
What's that to you?

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:19.298
Just wondering.

01:04:19.314 --> 01:04:23.344
Well then, let's get back to business,
'cause I'm late for my ballet class.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.719
Finish the job or face the consequences.

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:28.800
Am I clear?

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:30.705
Well...

01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:35.073
I got news for you, Number One.

01:04:35.997 --> 01:04:39.081
Given the situation,
I see why you're T.O.'d and all.

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:41.549
But, what's done is done.

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:43.364
And my partner comes first.

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.537
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means...

01:04:45.757 --> 01:04:48.315
that if you try to take her out
or get into the middle of our job,

01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:50.877
you're in for a world of hurt!

01:04:51.096 --> 01:04:53.839
I know what you're capable of,
but we're pros too.

01:04:54.182 --> 01:04:55.942
We also know that you're comin' now.

01:04:56.017 --> 01:04:59.135
Do you know what I wanted to be
when I was your age?

01:05:03.441 --> 01:05:04.773
I don't either.

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:07.814
I like you kid.

01:05:08.154 --> 01:05:10.862
You're in over your head
and you're scared,

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:14.238
yet you look death
in the eye without blinking.

01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:18.450
It's admirable,
but it won't save you.

01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:21.574
It won't save your partner

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:25.370
and it won't save your new pal.

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:29.081
Finish the job or face the
consequences.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.251
You've got an hour.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.673
Sorry about that stuff I said before.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:40.216
What stuff?

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:43.763
When I called you stupid and stuff.

01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:45.980
That's okay.

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:49.692
Did you find anymore bullets laying around?

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:56.149
Hey.

01:05:56.744 --> 01:05:58.576
Wanna hear somethin'?

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.208
Your daughter doesn't hate you.

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:06.793
How do you know?

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.496
I know.

01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:16.023
Well how could you?

01:06:17.348 --> 01:06:19.135
You've never even met her.

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:22.275
Doesn't matter.

01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:27.689
I still know
she doesn't hate you.

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:30.308
How?

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:34.446
I'm a daughter too.

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:50.286
Vi?

01:06:50.298 --> 01:06:51.454
She left.

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.381
Where'd she go?

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:56.009
To get more bullets.

01:07:07.774 --> 01:07:09.731
Listen carefully, Daisy.

01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:12.351
When she comes back,

01:07:13.738 --> 01:07:16.572
I need for you to be the one
to put me down.

01:07:18.326 --> 01:07:19.817
It's very important.

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:23.861
Why me?

01:07:29.128 --> 01:07:31.211
'Cause you and me are friends, right?

01:07:35.343 --> 01:07:38.131
- I guess, but...
- Will you promise me that?

01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:44.721
- I can't.
- I need you to promise me.

01:07:46.437 --> 01:07:48.720
- But I can't.
- I need you to do this for me.

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.138
- I can't.
- I need you to do this for me!

01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:52.562
- No, I can't!
- Don't argue with me, April!

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:55.143
- But I'm Daisy.
- Just don't argue with me girl!

01:08:06.457 --> 01:08:07.964
You promise me.

01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:11.384
Say it.

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:17.045
- I promise.
- You promise?

01:08:18.845 --> 01:08:20.962
I said I would, didn't I?

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:34.809
I have something to show you.

01:08:43.328 --> 01:08:48.073
I tried to give it to my daughter,
but she... threw it back at me.

01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:51.959
I think you're about her size.

01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:54.828
Could you try it on?

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.997
I'll wait in the other room.

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:33.901
Got the bullets.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.582
You'd be surprised how many places I...

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:38.792
What's goin' on?

01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:41.595
How do I look?

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:46.796
Okay.
Where did you get it?

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:48.845
He gave it to me.

01:09:52.772 --> 01:09:54.028
What for?

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:57.932
I don't know, Vi.

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:05.065
Can I talk to you a minute?

01:10:10.832 --> 01:10:12.032
Have you lost your mind?

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:13.791
- What's your problem?
- You're my problem!

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:15.985
I'll let you borrow it some time
if that's what this is about.

01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:17.863
No, it's not about a fucking dress!

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.921
- Yeah, right.
- That's exactly right!

01:10:20.007 --> 01:10:23.141
You don't run me, Violet!
We don't know anybody,

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:26.053
or get involved in stuff or
anything like that.

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:28.863
I never went to a prom.
You did, but I didn't.

01:10:29.016 --> 01:10:30.798
- Be glad you didn't!
- Why?

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:32.667
- Because they would laugh at you!
- How do you know?

01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:35.100
Because that's what they do
if you're different.

01:10:35.314 --> 01:10:38.853
Everybody isn't like that, Vi.
And so what if they laugh?

01:10:39.193 --> 01:10:40.725
- So what?
- Don't tell me what I know.

01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:42.377
You haven't been through things like me.

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:44.947
And I hope I never do
if it makes me so scared.

01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:47.608
- I'm not scared!
- Yes you are, Violet.

01:10:49.036 --> 01:10:51.428
You don't trust anyone,
or anything.

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:53.956
You never did.

01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:55.677
I trusted you!

01:10:57.003 --> 01:10:58.259
What?

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.088
I said I trusted you!

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:06.185
When did you stop?

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:09.255
The second I saw that
goddamn dress on your back!

01:11:11.309 --> 01:11:12.866
Well that's just perfect then.

01:11:13.019 --> 01:11:14.175
Why?

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:22.017
Because now you don't have anything at all.

01:11:25.072 --> 01:11:27.072
- So what are you trying to say?
- I just said it.

01:11:27.158 --> 01:11:28.669
Say it again, if you have the guts.

01:11:28.743 --> 01:11:30.863
- You heard me!
- I'm gonna kick your ass!

01:11:44.425 --> 01:11:47.433
Cut it out bitch!
You're gonna mess up my new dress.

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:09.565
My landlady was coming up the street.

01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:10.998
I was just...

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:13.239
just messin' with her.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.356
Never shot a gun before.

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:18.574
How was it?

01:12:18.575 --> 01:12:20.135
What are you, angling for
some new shoes now?

01:12:20.186 --> 01:12:21.697
- Shut up about it!
- You shut up about it!

01:12:21.712 --> 01:12:23.198
- Make me!
- I just did!

01:12:23.214 --> 01:12:25.201
- Oh, is that what you call it?
- Violet!

01:12:25.216 --> 01:12:26.372
What?

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:30.969
I almost forgot.
I got something for you too.

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:33.462
Really?

01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:57.721
- Why are you giving this to me?
- You have a unique world view.

01:12:58.165 --> 01:13:01.575
Now you can share with
others... in a new way.

01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:04.928
Thanks a lot, mister.

01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:10.233
I need the police.

01:13:11.846 --> 01:13:13.457
Yes, that's my address.

01:13:14.307 --> 01:13:15.873
What are you doin'?

01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:18.133
He's writing a letter.

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:20.092
To who?

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:21.595
To "whom".

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:23.095
To whom?

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:24.688
His daughter.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:35.816
I'll do it.

01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:38.277
What?

01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:40.497
I'll write it for you.

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:43.491
Alright.

01:13:45.129 --> 01:13:46.285
Thank you.

01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:02.269
So where was I?

01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:05.063
"Dear April..."

01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:08.142
That's it?

01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:09.772
So far, yeah.

01:14:12.657 --> 01:14:13.813
"Dear April,

01:14:18.037 --> 01:14:20.199
I don't know if you'll
ever read this,

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:24.082
but I hope you do.

01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:27.502
In any case...

01:14:29.423 --> 01:14:31.415
It's time we finally talk.

01:14:32.843 --> 01:14:35.301
Please, take care of yourself.

01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:41.349
I managed to put some
money in your bank accounts.

01:14:42.019 --> 01:14:44.957
Please use it to continue your education.

01:14:45.606 --> 01:14:47.973
Your mother would've wanted that too.

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:52.269
Don't worry about the
dead men in the bathtub.

01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:58.025
It's not what it looks like.

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.283
And a long story to tell right now.

01:15:06.085 --> 01:15:07.292
Sometimes,

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:09.778
for no particular reason,

01:15:10.297 --> 01:15:11.829
I think of you

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:14.541
and smile.

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:19.341
Seriously about that day, that...

01:15:20.558 --> 01:15:22.891
we drove out to the mall,

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.551
for your birthday.

01:15:26.772 --> 01:15:28.354
Your mom had the flu,

01:15:29.316 --> 01:15:31.558
and she said to go on without her.

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:38.232
I remember you wandered off.

01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:39.817
Got lost.

01:15:43.414 --> 01:15:45.030
And two hours later,

01:15:46.417 --> 01:15:48.204
we finally found each other.

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:51.953
We hugged...

01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:55.369
You didn't wanna let go.

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:02.218
Then we went for ice cream,

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:06.636
and we talked...
all the way home.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.564
I think that was the
happiest day I've had.

01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:23.322
I know I probably wasn't
the best father in the world,

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.457
but I tried the best I could.

01:16:36.342 --> 01:16:37.423
Anyway...

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:42.554
I've loved you all that I possibly can.

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:45.923
Love, Dad."

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:47.346
"PS:

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:51.529
This isn't in my handwriting,

01:16:53.901 --> 01:16:56.063
because friend of mine

01:16:56.821 --> 01:16:58.562
wrote it out for me."

01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:03.100
If you just leave that in the...

01:17:03.126 --> 01:17:06.695
apartment when you go,
it's sure to get to her.

01:17:08.999 --> 01:17:11.236
Glad you girls came by.

01:17:12.753 --> 01:17:15.086
I wouldn't have written that otherwise.

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:48.319
Daze...

01:17:52.293 --> 01:17:54.359
We gotta go now, Daze.

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:03.627
He never even said his name, Vi.

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:08.372
Come on.

01:18:41.508 --> 01:18:43.115
The bike is gone.

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:45.542
I know.

01:19:24.802 --> 01:19:27.164
- Well, we got 'em.
- Yep.

01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:30.847
- Yours looked awesome on you.
- Yeah, so did yours.

01:19:35.396 --> 01:19:39.686
Hey, I know we never really
talked about stuff... since that day.

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:41.236
Are we cool?

01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:44.477
Yeah.
Of course.

01:19:46.031 --> 01:19:47.487
Righteous.

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:52.952
Hey, you hungry or anything?

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:56.118
Not really.
I'm just gonna take a walk.

01:19:56.333 --> 01:19:58.120
Yeah, screw food.

01:19:58.335 --> 01:20:01.143
I could use a nap if you
wanna know the truth.

01:20:01.255 --> 01:20:03.347
You want me to take your bag home?

01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:04.580
No.

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:10.387
This better not be Russ.

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:14.482
It's my dad.

01:20:14.893 --> 01:20:15.968
Really?

01:20:15.970 --> 01:20:19.839
I tried to get the pizza place,
but I... I pressed his number instead.

01:20:21.859 --> 01:20:23.340
Long story.

01:20:23.444 --> 01:20:25.330
Hang on a sec, Phil.

01:20:37.624 --> 01:20:39.060
See you, Daze!

01:20:48.635 --> 01:20:49.791
Hey dad.

01:21:11.325 --> 01:21:12.481
April?

01:21:17.414 --> 01:21:19.030
Are you... uhm, April?

01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:38.023
Hi.

01:21:38.435 --> 01:21:39.691
Hi.

01:21:40.646 --> 01:21:42.854
I was a friend of your father's.

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:46.728
I just wanted to let you know that...

01:21:47.611 --> 01:21:49.848
I was a friend of his and...

01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:52.722
that he talked about you a lot.

01:21:57.204 --> 01:21:59.742
He wanted me to give
something to you too.

01:22:02.084 --> 01:22:03.640
What is it?

01:22:03.836 --> 01:22:06.123
It's the new Barbie Sunday dress.

01:22:06.672 --> 01:22:08.634
- For real?
- Yeah.

01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:11.165
I think it should fit.

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:14.886
There's something
else in there too.

01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:18.271
Thanks.

01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:19.907
You're welcome.

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:24.684
Your father was a good guy, April.

01:22:26.024 --> 01:22:30.064
He told me how you two got lost in the
mall one day and then had ice cream.

01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:37.457
Well...

01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:39.584
See ya.
