Subtitles by explosiveskull

01:07.360 --> 01:09.362
So sexy.

01:11.698 --> 01:12.998
Come here.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.499
Your breath stinks.

01:14.501 --> 01:16.768
Look who's talking.

01:16.770 --> 01:18.136
We should get going.

01:18.138 --> 01:19.670
No, skip it.

01:19.672 --> 01:22.341
We are going to be late.

01:28.549 --> 01:30.483
Fucking hate brunch.

01:31.551 --> 01:34.518
- Hey, babe...
- Yeah?

01:34.520 --> 01:36.587
Hot water's
not turning on again.

01:36.589 --> 01:39.124
- Are you serious?
- Can you call?

01:39.126 --> 01:40.859
She seems nice.

01:40.861 --> 01:42.459
Just see if she can
do something about it.

01:42.461 --> 01:43.763
Give me a sec.

01:56.976 --> 02:00.611
Uh, hi, is this Amy
from VacaSwap?

02:00.613 --> 02:02.713
Message?

02:02.715 --> 02:04.049
Uh, yeah, there's no
hot water over here.

02:04.051 --> 02:05.717
I was wondering if you
could send somebody to...

02:05.719 --> 02:07.419
Okay.

02:17.463 --> 02:19.697
- Hey, babe?
- Yeah?

02:19.699 --> 02:22.700
- Did you call?
- Some dude answered.

02:22.702 --> 02:23.934
Okay.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.436
Don't you think
that's weird?

02:25.438 --> 02:26.437
We're renting
from some hot chick,

02:26.439 --> 02:27.905
and some dude answers?

02:27.907 --> 02:29.673
It's probably her husband.

02:29.675 --> 02:31.610
Should've just rented
from a hotel.

02:33.511 --> 02:36.046
Hey, what's the matter?

02:36.048 --> 02:38.749
It's a little early to be so
paranoid, don't you think?

02:38.751 --> 02:40.119
Yeah.

02:48.694 --> 02:50.527
I thought my breath stank.

02:50.529 --> 02:51.797
I don't care.

02:53.733 --> 02:54.731
Neither do I.

06:04.255 --> 06:06.256
Mm.

06:59.108 --> 07:01.243
I don't wanna go
back to Albuquerque.

07:01.245 --> 07:02.843
We still have a couple days.

07:02.845 --> 07:04.146
I mean, let's...
let's take a trip.

07:04.148 --> 07:05.745
Let's go somewhere new.

07:05.747 --> 07:07.715
Let's fly to Chicago
or Boston or something,

07:07.717 --> 07:09.150
you know?

07:09.152 --> 07:10.786
Yeah, who's gonna pay for that?

07:11.988 --> 07:13.954
Hey, have you seen my keys?

07:13.956 --> 07:15.457
Are you listening to me?

07:15.459 --> 07:17.225
I can't find my keys.

07:17.227 --> 07:19.894
Uh, did you check...
check your purse?

07:19.896 --> 07:21.262
They're not in my purse.

07:21.264 --> 07:22.463
Don't you wanna
go somewhere?

07:22.465 --> 07:24.832
Like San Francisco
or something?

07:24.834 --> 07:26.903
Sure, money bags,
if you're buying.

07:31.908 --> 07:33.409
I feel like
I'm going crazy here.

07:35.011 --> 07:36.979
Did you check your jeans?

07:46.822 --> 07:48.989
I could've swear
I left them on the counter.

07:48.991 --> 07:52.427
- Well, you didn't.
- Hey, is that my toothbrush?

07:52.429 --> 07:54.027
Yeah, mine fell
on the ground.

07:54.029 --> 07:55.962
Gross! You can't just
use my toothbrush.

07:55.964 --> 07:57.431
What are you nuts?
Why not?

07:57.433 --> 07:59.166
'Cause that's gross.
It's mine.

07:59.168 --> 08:01.202
Maybe you should,
like... If I were to...

08:01.204 --> 08:03.871
- Whoops.
- Don't!

08:03.873 --> 08:06.206
What did you do to this thing?

08:06.208 --> 08:07.840
Nothing, what's wrong with it?

08:09.445 --> 08:12.179
Did you drop it
in the toilet or something?

08:12.181 --> 08:14.448
- It tastes like shit.
- Okay, dickhead.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.817
Literal shit.
I'm being serious.

08:16.819 --> 08:18.218
I think you need to see
a doctor or something,

08:18.220 --> 08:20.186
because this is heinous.

08:20.188 --> 08:22.088
See, this is why

08:22.090 --> 08:23.326
I don't want you
touching my things.

09:01.863 --> 09:03.466
Hello?

09:07.068 --> 09:08.270
Hello?

11:22.503 --> 11:24.371
Okay, okay.

11:35.616 --> 11:38.385
There you go.
There you go.

13:09.074 --> 13:11.675
- It's bullshit.
- Hey.

13:11.677 --> 13:14.778
If Molly can bring Danielle,
I should be able to bring Will.

13:14.780 --> 13:18.114
- Molly's in college.
- I'm a senior!

13:18.116 --> 13:20.149
Well, then next year.

13:20.151 --> 13:22.120
Will's a pain in the ass!

13:23.322 --> 13:24.522
What about Drew?

13:24.524 --> 13:25.656
No, not that kid.

13:25.658 --> 13:27.291
He doesn't wear deodorant.

13:27.293 --> 13:29.559
Sweetheart, what do you think
of this one?

13:29.561 --> 13:31.129
Come here.

13:36.669 --> 13:38.536
Yeah, I don't think

13:38.538 --> 13:39.805
I want to rent
from the Unabomber.

13:41.573 --> 13:44.710
Okay, then what about this one?

13:48.748 --> 13:50.449
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

13:52.285 --> 13:53.883
What do you think
of this place?

13:53.885 --> 13:56.721
See yourself sitting poolside
here for a couple weeks?

13:59.592 --> 14:01.124
Who are we renting from?

14:01.126 --> 14:02.628
Her.

14:04.630 --> 14:07.132
- She seems nice.
- Hmm, yeah.

15:21.606 --> 15:22.772
Help!

15:22.774 --> 15:24.474
Help!

15:27.779 --> 15:29.813
Help! Somebody help me!

15:48.465 --> 15:49.899
Help!

15:49.901 --> 15:51.467
Help, somebody!

15:51.469 --> 15:53.604
Help!

15:54.805 --> 15:55.937
Oh, my God!

16:29.439 --> 16:31.542
It's time little girls
go to sleep.

16:53.897 --> 16:55.298
Why are you wet?

17:11.815 --> 17:13.784
Where are you going?

19:22.844 --> 19:24.677
How far out of town
is this place?

19:24.679 --> 19:25.913
The website says it's within

19:25.915 --> 19:27.181
walking distance
of the nightlife.

19:27.183 --> 19:29.215
They all say that.

19:29.217 --> 19:32.552
Well, all I can do
is read the description.

19:32.554 --> 19:34.654
Did you check
the map on the site?

19:34.656 --> 19:36.458
What map?

19:37.692 --> 19:39.459
The map, so you can
call bullshit

19:39.461 --> 19:41.526
when they say everything
is walking distance.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.129
I didn't see a map.

19:43.131 --> 19:45.565
Great, the last house
was miles back.

19:45.567 --> 19:46.799
Well, I guess you're stuck

19:46.801 --> 19:48.501
hanging out with us then.

19:48.503 --> 19:51.571
Hey, Danielle, you ever
play Settlers of Catan?

19:51.573 --> 19:53.840
- I don't think so.
- Can we borrow the car?

19:53.842 --> 19:56.042
Already?

19:56.044 --> 19:57.577
We haven't even
gotten there yet.

19:57.579 --> 19:59.679
Okay, could you just
give the place a chance?

19:59.681 --> 20:01.683
It's not like
it's gonna kill you.

20:11.860 --> 20:13.495
Wow.

20:14.863 --> 20:16.864
This place is insane.

20:17.932 --> 20:19.831
See?

20:19.833 --> 20:21.970
Your mother's not such
an idiot after all.

20:23.605 --> 20:25.872
You know what I mean.

20:25.874 --> 20:28.275
- Look at that!
- I know.

20:28.277 --> 20:29.808
Very nice.

20:29.810 --> 20:32.479
Well, I guess
we need to get some food.

20:33.647 --> 20:35.547
Gross.

20:35.549 --> 20:36.883
What?

20:36.885 --> 20:40.687
Someone left some
fast food in here.

20:45.260 --> 20:46.825
Don't... Don't open it.

20:50.999 --> 20:53.532
It smells like...
like old mayo.

20:53.534 --> 20:56.168
A morbid curiosity,
you know that?

20:56.170 --> 20:57.936
Where are you going?

20:57.938 --> 20:59.705
I'm throwing this away outside.

20:59.707 --> 21:01.941
You want something
from the store?

21:01.943 --> 21:03.810
- Now?
- Yeah.

21:03.812 --> 21:05.310
You know, it's kind of a haul,

21:05.312 --> 21:07.779
and the kids are
gonna be hungry soon.

21:07.781 --> 21:10.549
- Okay.
- I'll be back in a few.

21:10.551 --> 21:13.219
The closest Uber
is 45 minutes away.

21:13.221 --> 21:15.088
This house is pretty sick.

21:15.090 --> 21:16.822
No, we're going to be stuck
with my parents

21:16.824 --> 21:19.159
playing board games
all week... sober.

21:20.961 --> 21:23.097
Here.

21:29.970 --> 21:30.971
Do you have a chaser?

21:34.208 --> 21:36.277
That'll put hair
on your chest.

21:38.012 --> 21:40.046
My parents will kill us.

21:40.048 --> 21:41.982
Live a little.

21:45.352 --> 21:46.787
Come on,
we're gonna miss the sun.

22:25.893 --> 22:27.327
Over here.

22:36.336 --> 22:38.003
How are things
going with Andrew?

22:40.107 --> 22:42.873
- I think he's cheating on me.
- Get the fuck out.

22:42.875 --> 22:45.109
I just think that now that
we've been dating for a while,

22:45.111 --> 22:49.081
like, he's kinda over it.
You know, like he's wandering.

22:49.083 --> 22:52.917
Mm, honestly, the kid's always
kinda creeped me out anyway.

22:52.919 --> 22:56.053
- He'd be crazy to cheat on you.
- I don't know.

22:56.055 --> 22:59.123
The problem with you, is you
like guys who idolize you.

22:59.125 --> 23:01.159
- No.
- You want admirers.

23:01.161 --> 23:04.229
- Not boyfriends.
- Look, I just need to

23:04.231 --> 23:05.963
break it off clean,
get laid this weekend

23:05.965 --> 23:07.798
and forget all about it.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.769
Yeah, no one's
gettin' laid on this trip.

23:11.070 --> 23:12.272
Speak for yourself.

23:16.741 --> 23:18.911
What the fuck?
Is he staring at us?

23:20.179 --> 23:21.412
He's kind of cute.

23:21.414 --> 23:25.116
Oh, that's fucking gross. No.

23:27.120 --> 23:29.320
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:29.322 --> 23:30.988
What are you watching?

23:30.990 --> 23:34.792
Well, they don't have
cable or Wi-Fi, so...

23:34.794 --> 23:36.227
Really?

23:36.229 --> 23:39.866
Yeah, so it's either PBS or...

23:41.167 --> 23:43.635
another channel playing PBS.

23:46.139 --> 23:48.708
God, the Overlook Hotel
had more things to do.

23:49.976 --> 23:52.477
- The what?
- You know, the, um...

23:54.213 --> 23:57.216
the hotel from The Shining.

23:58.951 --> 24:01.352
Um, aren't you
a little cold, Danielle?

24:01.354 --> 24:03.988
I'm okay. Thank you.

24:03.990 --> 24:05.722
Don't get the couch wet.

24:05.724 --> 24:07.426
Put on some clothes.

26:50.455 --> 26:52.355
Somebody help!

26:53.590 --> 26:56.091
Somebody help me!

26:57.528 --> 27:00.329
Somebody help me!

27:00.331 --> 27:03.433
Hello! Somebody!

27:03.435 --> 27:04.867
God damn it!

28:25.982 --> 28:29.017
It's going to be all right.

29:16.331 --> 29:18.364
We should've stayed in a hotel.

29:18.366 --> 29:20.133
What's wrong?

29:20.135 --> 29:22.603
There was a hair on the soap
in the shower.

29:22.605 --> 29:25.372
So throw it out.

29:25.374 --> 29:27.341
There was the lipstick stain
on the wine glass.

29:27.343 --> 29:30.376
I mean, honey, who knows if
they even change these sheets.

29:30.378 --> 29:33.379
You really think a hotel
would be any different?

29:33.381 --> 29:35.483
I just feel like
I'm in someone else's house.

29:35.485 --> 29:38.385
You know, like I'm not
supposed to be here.

29:38.387 --> 29:39.587
It creeps me out.

29:39.589 --> 29:42.489
Honey, this place
is incredible.

29:42.491 --> 29:45.425
And cheap.
It's got a pool!

29:45.427 --> 29:48.161
But if you wanna stay
in that creepy little hotel

29:48.163 --> 29:49.630
in town, be my guest.

29:49.632 --> 29:51.665
Yeah, you'd love that.

29:51.667 --> 29:53.299
You'd have a blast.

29:53.301 --> 29:55.401
Pay by the hour. Color TV.

29:55.403 --> 29:57.270
Comes with a prostitute.

29:57.272 --> 29:58.706
I guess the last time
I paid for sex

29:58.708 --> 30:00.273
was our first date.

30:00.275 --> 30:01.642
You ass!

30:07.315 --> 30:08.650
Maybe you're right.

30:13.656 --> 30:16.255
You know,
I think as a germophobe,

30:16.257 --> 30:18.260
this is a best-case
scenario for you.

30:21.263 --> 30:24.464
It doesn't creep you out
to be in someone else's house?

30:24.466 --> 30:26.368
No, why should it?

30:29.604 --> 30:31.105
Does it turn you on?

30:33.808 --> 30:37.544
Well, talk about creepy.

30:38.714 --> 30:40.682
Maybe it does.

31:52.353 --> 31:53.352
Kyle.

31:54.755 --> 31:58.523
Jesus Christ,
you scared me.

31:58.525 --> 31:59.892
What you doing?

31:59.894 --> 32:01.861
I'm just hanging out.

32:01.863 --> 32:04.362
Yeah? Looks like
you're smoking some drugs.

32:04.364 --> 32:07.635
Uh...

32:09.770 --> 32:11.503
Wanna go for a swim?

32:11.505 --> 32:15.607
I, uh...
Uh, I don't know.

32:15.609 --> 32:17.845
I don't know if
that'd be a good idea.

32:19.613 --> 32:21.682
Well, suit yourself.

32:31.525 --> 32:33.290
You're really not gonna get in?

32:33.292 --> 32:35.427
It's freezing.

32:35.429 --> 32:37.663
Just gonna sit there
and watch me?

32:37.665 --> 32:39.731
No, I...

32:39.733 --> 32:40.798
I don't know.

32:40.800 --> 32:42.668
I should probably head back in.

32:42.670 --> 32:44.903
I'm busting your balls.

32:44.905 --> 32:46.638
Are you just gonna sit around

32:46.640 --> 32:48.640
and sulk all week,
or are you gonna have fun?

32:48.642 --> 32:51.009
This sucks, dude.
There's nothing to do.

32:51.011 --> 32:53.277
I mean, at least you and Molly
can hang out with each other.

32:53.279 --> 32:54.882
You can hang out with us.

32:56.817 --> 32:58.684
I just... I don't get
why my parents

32:58.686 --> 33:00.919
drag us to these things.

33:00.921 --> 33:02.888
You know my mom
rents out our place

33:02.890 --> 33:04.455
while we're gone?

33:04.457 --> 33:06.257
So while I'm in
someone else's bed,

33:06.259 --> 33:08.026
some creep's in mine.

33:08.028 --> 33:09.529
It's fucking weird.

33:10.664 --> 33:12.597
What size bed do you have?

33:12.599 --> 33:13.901
Queen. Why?

33:16.402 --> 33:18.369
There are people
fucking in your bed.

33:18.371 --> 33:20.972
- Dude, what the fuck?
- I'm just saying, the odds are.

33:23.777 --> 33:25.376
That's fucked up.

33:27.448 --> 33:30.614
Well...

33:30.616 --> 33:32.583
I'm going in.

33:32.585 --> 33:35.254
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

33:56.709 --> 33:57.977
What are you doing?

33:59.645 --> 34:01.378
Caught your brother
smoking weed.

34:01.380 --> 34:03.815
Yeah, I saw you.
My parents probably did, too.

34:03.817 --> 34:06.917
They're on the other side
of the house.

34:06.919 --> 34:09.652
I know you're going through
a rough spot right now,

34:09.655 --> 34:12.291
but don't flirt with my brother
to make yourself feel better.

34:13.559 --> 34:16.458
What...?
Oh, geez, no...

34:16.460 --> 34:17.964
I'm not flirting
with your brother.

34:37.884 --> 34:39.051
How long have you
been down here?

34:40.752 --> 34:42.286
I don't know anymore.

34:44.023 --> 34:45.056
Here.

34:46.491 --> 34:48.058
You should drink something.

34:48.060 --> 34:50.628
He give you that?

34:50.630 --> 34:53.029
- It's okay...
- No, no.

34:53.031 --> 34:55.067
Fuck that.

34:59.138 --> 35:00.706
Have you tried to escape?

35:01.808 --> 35:04.073
It's not a good idea.

35:04.075 --> 35:06.676
Look, we have to
get out of here, all right.

35:06.678 --> 35:08.378
There's gotta be some way
out of this place.

35:08.380 --> 35:09.947
There isn't.

35:09.949 --> 35:13.550
The only way
in or out is the hatch.

35:13.552 --> 35:17.987
The vents are too small.
No one can hear us.

35:17.989 --> 35:20.592
I went hoarse in the beginning
yelling for weeks.

35:21.760 --> 35:23.428
There's no one for miles.

35:24.696 --> 35:27.497
Well, does he come down here?

35:27.499 --> 35:29.000
There's two of us.
We can take him.

35:30.569 --> 35:31.803
No...

35:33.104 --> 35:36.906
No, you can't.
Believe me...

35:36.908 --> 35:39.676
Look, I'm not living here
for the rest of my fucking life.

35:39.678 --> 35:41.577
He'll kill you.

35:41.579 --> 35:43.048
You're not the first girl
to come down here.

35:45.450 --> 35:48.618
There was another.

35:48.620 --> 35:51.423
She tried to make a run for it,
and she never came back.

35:52.723 --> 35:54.425
Maybe she got away.

35:57.629 --> 35:58.661
She didn't.

35:58.663 --> 36:00.098
How do you know?

36:03.435 --> 36:06.537
Because three nights later he made
me dig a hole in the backyard.

36:07.538 --> 36:09.007
Jesus Christ.

36:10.642 --> 36:12.911
Don't try to escape.

36:42.506 --> 36:44.742
What's up there, little guy.
Sign for that?

36:50.547 --> 36:52.116
Some sort of
filmmaker or somethin'?

36:53.183 --> 36:55.117
No.

36:55.119 --> 36:56.420
Third package this week.

36:57.721 --> 36:59.124
Video supplies.

37:01.192 --> 37:02.526
What's in the box?

37:03.695 --> 37:05.062
I dunno.

37:08.632 --> 37:10.100
You smell that?

37:11.635 --> 37:13.102
- What?
- I don't know.

37:13.104 --> 37:14.237
Somethin' funky in there, boss.

37:14.239 --> 37:15.639
Get it checked out.

38:04.587 --> 38:05.621
Who was it?

38:08.192 --> 38:10.125
Delivery guy.

38:10.127 --> 38:11.195
Oh.

42:19.173 --> 42:21.440
Hey, who was the last one out?

42:21.442 --> 42:22.908
Kyle, Molly.

42:22.910 --> 42:24.943
- Kyle, get the hot tub heated.
- Hey!

42:24.945 --> 42:26.878
- What?
- Who was the last one out?

42:26.880 --> 42:28.148
I don't know.

42:30.551 --> 42:32.251
What's wrong?

42:32.253 --> 42:33.952
The door was unlocked.

42:33.954 --> 42:37.091
Oh, honey, come on.
Hurry!

43:31.210 --> 43:32.211
Hi.

43:33.547 --> 43:35.247
Can I change in here?

43:35.249 --> 43:36.583
Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

45:07.440 --> 45:09.673
What are you doing?

45:09.675 --> 45:11.675
I keep getting to open it
a half inch I just need...

45:11.677 --> 45:13.413
I just need more leverage.

45:14.547 --> 45:16.081
Don't.

45:18.383 --> 45:20.718
He's convinced you not to try.

45:20.720 --> 45:22.586
That's what he's counting on.

45:22.588 --> 45:25.723
Look, Granny, it doesn't get any
fucking worse than this.

45:25.725 --> 45:28.558
The books, the food, the bed.

45:28.560 --> 45:31.094
You have no idea what it's like
when this place is empty

45:31.096 --> 45:33.396
and no food comes down
that hatch for days.

45:33.398 --> 45:35.633
You go crazy.
We can't risk that.

45:35.635 --> 45:38.269
Yeah, I'm not going to roll over
and die for some fucking books.

45:38.271 --> 45:39.571
He'll kill you.

45:43.675 --> 45:46.042
We are getting out of here.

45:46.044 --> 45:47.279
But I'm gonna need your help.

45:55.353 --> 45:59.522
- You hear that?
- Come on!

45:59.524 --> 46:00.526
He's coming.

46:05.564 --> 46:07.430
You hear that?

46:07.432 --> 46:08.700
Shit!

46:13.472 --> 46:15.707
He's gonna kill us.
What the fuck were you thinking?

46:18.376 --> 46:20.212
Just get behind me.

46:49.674 --> 46:50.673
What are you guys doing?

46:50.675 --> 46:52.608
Hey.

46:52.610 --> 46:54.713
Oh, shit, I'm gonna reek.

46:57.382 --> 46:59.716
Dude, don't give
this to my brother.

46:59.718 --> 47:01.784
He starts puking, we're gonna
be the ones in trouble.

47:01.786 --> 47:04.486
- I'm not gonna puke.
- Go put a clean shirt on.

47:12.330 --> 47:14.631
I've been in here so long,
sometimes it feels like

47:14.633 --> 47:16.734
there's nothing outside
of this place anymore.

47:18.269 --> 47:20.737
Well, don't give up.

47:20.739 --> 47:22.605
You've got a real life
to get back to.

47:22.607 --> 47:24.306
Remember that.

47:24.308 --> 47:27.144
Friends, family...
Who do you have?

47:31.649 --> 47:34.151
A son.

47:36.420 --> 47:38.690
Okay, well, think about him.

47:40.724 --> 47:45.160
You owe it to him to at
least try and get out of here.

47:45.162 --> 47:49.599
Otherwise, he'll spend his whole
life wondering where you are.

47:49.601 --> 47:53.069
- He won't remember me.
- Don't say that.

47:55.673 --> 47:58.442
I've been in here
longer than he's been alive.

48:03.179 --> 48:06.317
I'm sorry. Jesus.

48:09.486 --> 48:12.323
I was pregnant
when he kidnaped me.

48:15.391 --> 48:18.127
I thought I'd die in labor
and that'd be it.

48:20.698 --> 48:22.366
But I didn't.

48:31.709 --> 48:34.177
I'll never know
what he did to him.

48:37.615 --> 48:39.349
Then you have to kill him.

48:42.418 --> 48:44.218
He's an old man.

48:44.220 --> 48:45.723
There's two of us.

48:48.559 --> 48:50.160
We can do this.

48:56.199 --> 48:58.234
Sometimes he lets us
out of the bunker.

48:59.470 --> 49:01.303
When?

49:01.305 --> 49:03.172
To bathe us.

49:04.941 --> 49:06.209
That's when we'll do it.

55:00.093 --> 55:01.095
Hey, Molly?

55:04.197 --> 55:05.198
Molly?

55:09.202 --> 55:10.536
Molly...

55:39.131 --> 55:41.831
- Whoa! I scare you?
- No.

55:41.833 --> 55:44.801
- Everyone at the pool?
- Yeah.

55:44.803 --> 55:46.669
Well,
can you take orders, for me?

55:46.671 --> 55:48.305
See who wants burgers
and who wants dogs?

55:48.307 --> 55:51.676
- Yeah, sure.
- All right, thanks.

56:14.699 --> 56:16.601
We would never do that.

56:19.304 --> 56:21.305
Hey, did you go through my bag?

56:21.307 --> 56:22.641
No...

56:25.211 --> 56:27.210
You didn't look for the vodka?

56:27.212 --> 56:29.681
No, why?
What happened?

56:30.782 --> 56:32.284
It's just a mess.

56:35.321 --> 56:37.154
What the fuck?

56:37.156 --> 56:38.422
Yeah...

56:38.424 --> 56:39.958
Is anything missing?

56:41.193 --> 56:43.628
- Uh, no.
- You sure?

56:44.930 --> 56:46.231
Yeah, everything is in here.

56:48.066 --> 56:51.034
Did my fucking brother
steal your booze?

56:51.036 --> 56:52.768
Maybe a little bit.

56:52.770 --> 56:54.237
I'm gonna go talk to him,
that's really not cool.

56:54.239 --> 56:56.039
It's fine,
I said he could.

56:56.041 --> 56:58.009
Whatever, he shouldn't be
rifling through your shit.

57:46.491 --> 57:47.723
What the fuck, dude?

57:47.725 --> 57:49.259
What?

57:49.261 --> 57:51.727
Do you have something
to say to me?

57:51.729 --> 57:53.397
You wanna hit this?

57:54.865 --> 57:56.899
Where is my fucking underwear?

57:56.901 --> 57:59.402
- Uh...
- I know that you took it.

57:59.404 --> 58:01.873
You... you what?

58:03.874 --> 58:06.141
Dude, that's fucking weird.

58:06.143 --> 58:08.944
What the fuck
are you talking about?

58:08.946 --> 58:11.813
I know that you were in the house
when I was in the bathroom.

58:11.815 --> 58:13.216
I didn't take
your fucking underwear.

58:13.218 --> 58:14.450
Okay, then where are they?

58:14.452 --> 58:16.053
How the fuck
am I supposed to know?

58:17.788 --> 58:19.855
Yo, Danielle, I didn't
take your shit, I promise.

58:19.857 --> 58:21.292
You are a little fucking creep.

58:23.294 --> 58:25.163
What the fuck?

59:45.542 --> 59:46.974
What's going on with you?

59:46.976 --> 59:49.311
Nothing.

59:49.313 --> 59:50.546
Is Andrew cheating on you?

59:52.115 --> 59:54.117
You deserve better
than that shit.

59:58.555 --> 01:00:01.456
I just don't get
what's wrong with some guys.

01:00:01.458 --> 01:00:06.260
You know, like what happened in their lives
that made them just, like, cross boundaries,

01:00:06.262 --> 01:00:09.497
and just be... creeps?

01:00:09.499 --> 01:00:10.800
I don't know.

01:00:13.537 --> 01:00:16.172
Why are there
so many fucking creeps?

01:00:20.310 --> 01:00:22.178
Some guys are just fucked up.

01:00:24.013 --> 01:00:25.348
It's like they were
born that way.

01:00:32.655 --> 01:00:34.290
Some people
are just born crazy.

01:00:54.677 --> 01:00:56.111
Time to take a bath.

01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:36.285
Fuck!

01:01:42.424 --> 01:01:44.059
Nice and warm?

01:01:46.228 --> 01:01:47.262
Uh-huh.

01:02:09.251 --> 01:02:10.485
Goddammit.

01:02:27.334 --> 01:02:29.170
Sorry, I was thirsty.

01:03:50.818 --> 01:03:52.419
Time to get those clothes off.

01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:28.521
Open the door!

01:04:32.726 --> 01:04:34.393
The only way I come out,
is if Claire's free,

01:04:34.395 --> 01:04:35.661
you understand?

01:04:35.663 --> 01:04:38.262
Playtime's over.

01:04:38.264 --> 01:04:40.567
Let her out!

01:05:31.851 --> 01:05:34.485
Open the fucking door!

01:05:34.487 --> 01:05:35.655
All right.

01:05:37.357 --> 01:05:38.658
I'm coming out.

01:06:10.323 --> 01:06:11.689
Are you serious?

01:06:11.691 --> 01:06:13.359
What's going on?

01:06:14.693 --> 01:06:16.395
I didn't do anything.

01:06:17.997 --> 01:06:19.563
Do you wanna tell her?

01:06:19.565 --> 01:06:21.231
Or do you wanna leave us alone?

01:06:21.233 --> 01:06:23.336
I didn't fucking do anything!

01:06:26.772 --> 01:06:28.774
Jesus Christ.

01:06:33.579 --> 01:06:36.447
Hey,
I appreciate the tenacity, kid,

01:06:36.449 --> 01:06:38.948
but I think Danielle's
a little out of your league.

01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:40.817
I don't have a fucking
thing for Danielle.

01:06:40.819 --> 01:06:44.521
Oh...
I was just pulling your leg.

01:06:44.523 --> 01:06:45.488
What was that about?

01:06:46.926 --> 01:06:48.494
Nothing, I'll talk to him.

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:25.562
- Honey, you look pretty.
- Aw, you're sweet.

01:07:25.564 --> 01:07:27.764
I hear this place
is supposed to be really good.

01:07:27.766 --> 01:07:28.934
Yeah?

01:07:30.602 --> 01:07:32.068
What's up, bud?

01:07:32.070 --> 01:07:35.574
Um, I... I don't want to
stay here tonight.

01:07:37.409 --> 01:07:39.441
Order a pizza, hit the pool,
it'll be fun.

01:07:39.443 --> 01:07:43.079
No, I can't. I can't hang out
with Molly and Danielle...

01:07:43.081 --> 01:07:45.048
Okay, what's going on
with you guys?

01:07:45.050 --> 01:07:48.720
Just don't make me stay here.

01:07:50.588 --> 01:07:51.988
What'd you do to your brother?

01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:53.655
I didn't do anything.
He's the one

01:07:53.657 --> 01:07:56.358
- creeping on my friend.
- Uh, Molly.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.994
Give him a break, he's a kid.

01:07:57.996 --> 01:08:00.530
Dad, you're raising a predator.

01:08:00.532 --> 01:08:03.732
I... I'm sorry,
is he making you uncomfortable?

01:08:03.734 --> 01:08:05.835
No, it's fine.

01:08:05.837 --> 01:08:07.005
We're not hanging out with him.

01:08:09.541 --> 01:08:12.377
Can your mother and I just have
one night out by ourselves?

01:08:15.346 --> 01:08:17.413
He's not coming with us.

01:08:41.471 --> 01:08:43.839
- Where did you get that?
- None of your business.

01:08:43.841 --> 01:08:45.808
They're going to notice that.

01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:47.509
Fine, we'll fill it
with water.

01:08:47.511 --> 01:08:50.011
Live a little.

01:08:50.014 --> 01:08:54.018
Cheers to your brother...

01:09:05.629 --> 01:09:06.697
Wimp!

01:11:34.644 --> 01:11:35.645
You were snoring.

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.748
Sorry, I'm beat.

01:11:43.152 --> 01:11:44.586
Are you going to bed?

01:12:56.158 --> 01:12:57.793
Molly...

01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:04.099
Molly?

01:13:12.774 --> 01:13:14.740
Molly.

01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:19.347
Yeah?

01:13:20.382 --> 01:13:22.816
What's wrong?

01:13:22.818 --> 01:13:25.085
You scared the shit out of me,
I thought you were your parents.

01:13:25.087 --> 01:13:26.687
You should put the booze back.

01:13:28.155 --> 01:13:30.356
Fuck.

01:13:30.358 --> 01:13:32.994
Oh, shit.
Shit, shit, shit.

01:13:34.329 --> 01:13:35.864
Oh...

01:13:49.144 --> 01:13:50.442
What happened?

01:13:50.444 --> 01:13:52.344
I fucking spilled on the couch.

01:13:52.346 --> 01:13:54.115
Dude, what the fuck!

01:14:05.893 --> 01:14:07.426
Fuck, they're home.

01:14:07.428 --> 01:14:09.294
Here, uh, look,
you go distract them.

01:14:09.296 --> 01:14:10.232
I'll put the booze away.

01:14:14.101 --> 01:14:15.768
You guys are home early!

01:14:18.072 --> 01:14:19.206
Mom?

01:14:20.274 --> 01:14:21.175
Dad?

01:14:49.236 --> 01:14:50.437
Danielle?

01:14:56.110 --> 01:14:57.077
Danielle?

01:15:03.783 --> 01:15:05.084
Danielle...

01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:38.218
Shh, shh...

01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:20.825
Thank you... thank you.

01:16:20.827 --> 01:16:21.892
Thank you.

01:16:21.894 --> 01:16:23.329
It's gonna be okay.

01:16:24.498 --> 01:16:26.464
You saw my face.

01:16:28.601 --> 01:16:30.802
But you don't have to die.

01:16:59.465 --> 01:17:00.833
...emergency,
can I have your name?

01:17:04.403 --> 01:17:05.402
Who's that?

01:17:05.404 --> 01:17:07.205
Was that there before?

01:17:08.408 --> 01:17:09.808
No.

01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:25.189
We're home!
Hide the booze!

01:17:25.191 --> 01:17:27.190
Molly!

01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:40.403
Hello?

01:17:41.406 --> 01:17:42.939
Danielle?!

01:17:42.941 --> 01:17:45.676
Holy shit.

01:17:45.678 --> 01:17:49.646
Molly! Molly! Molly!

01:17:49.648 --> 01:17:51.614
Molly! Oh, geez...

01:17:51.616 --> 01:17:53.316
Oh, my God, honey...

01:17:53.318 --> 01:17:54.584
Danielle?

01:17:59.124 --> 01:18:00.626
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck happened?

01:18:14.639 --> 01:18:17.141
Kyle? Kyle!

01:20:33.511 --> 01:20:34.578
Come back!

01:21:00.337 --> 01:21:01.704
Hold on!

01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:05.141
I can fix it!

01:21:09.713 --> 01:21:11.245
Hurry!

01:21:11.247 --> 01:21:13.383
Pop the hood!

01:21:18.855 --> 01:21:20.621
Junior!

01:21:20.623 --> 01:21:22.191
Get over here!

01:21:28.631 --> 01:21:30.298
Hurry!

01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:32.166
Junior!

01:21:32.168 --> 01:21:33.568
Now!

01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:34.671
[engine starts

01:21:55.558 --> 01:21:56.526
Holy shit.

01:22:08.471 --> 01:22:09.639
Get in.

01:22:47.810 --> 01:22:52.381
Fucking psychopath, boss.

01:22:53.548 --> 01:22:55.350
Watching all those people.

01:22:57.486 --> 01:23:01.320
Hundreds of thousands
of hours on those hard drives.

01:23:01.322 --> 01:23:02.889
How many houses
does that guy have?

01:23:02.891 --> 01:23:07.293
- Several. Ortiz,
he had to break the news

01:23:07.295 --> 01:23:10.397
to the family
over in Silver City.

01:23:10.399 --> 01:23:12.599
Said you should've seen
the look on the mother's face

01:23:12.601 --> 01:23:15.436
when they pulled a spy cam
out their kids bedroom.

01:23:17.238 --> 01:23:19.572
Fuckin' hell.

01:23:19.574 --> 01:23:22.575
And three of them houses...
empty.

01:23:22.577 --> 01:23:27.515
Save for some cheap cots,
chains... and sound proofing.

01:23:30.652 --> 01:23:33.288
Musta been other girls.

01:23:37.391 --> 01:23:39.293
There it is.

01:23:52.673 --> 01:23:53.909
Who's this?

01:24:01.549 --> 01:24:02.981
Fuck.

01:24:02.983 --> 01:24:04.884
It's where they said
they left him.

01:24:04.886 --> 01:24:11.391
My guess is some good Samaritan
stopped to help.

01:24:11.393 --> 01:24:13.292
Guessin' he did this to her
and stole her wheels.

01:24:13.294 --> 01:24:15.327
Son of a bitch.

01:24:15.329 --> 01:24:16.395
You all right there, junior?

01:24:18.499 --> 01:24:20.299
Yeah...

01:24:20.301 --> 01:24:23.603
I had some... expired hot dogs.

01:25:38.678 --> 01:25:40.012
Buckle up, ladies.
