00:01.062 --> 00:02.459
Previously on "God Friended Me"...

00:02.460 --> 00:04.419
Please, welcome back to
"The Millennial Prophet"

00:04.420 --> 00:06.879
my old friend, Rabbi Zoe Schwartz.

00:06.880 --> 00:09.539
Someone calling themselves
God on Facebook

00:09.540 --> 00:11.521
started sending me random
Friend Suggestions.

00:11.522 --> 00:13.299
- Miles, Cara.
- Graham.

00:13.300 --> 00:14.349
If you hadn't shown up today,

00:14.350 --> 00:16.020
who knows what the next 10
years would've looked like.

00:16.021 --> 00:18.395
They're nominating you to
become Bishop of New York.

00:18.396 --> 00:20.103
Always trust your heart,

00:20.104 --> 00:22.289
because it will never steer you wrong.

00:24.187 --> 00:25.728
I think I love her.

00:25.729 --> 00:28.895
Simon wasn't the recipient of
the bone marrow transplant.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.019
He was the donor.

00:32.229 --> 00:34.429
- Hello, Miles.
- Pria?

00:34.430 --> 00:35.719
So this is Henry Chase.

00:35.720 --> 00:38.519
Simon stole Henry's
code. He stole Juliet.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.140
You want to destroy Simon's code?

00:40.146 --> 00:41.529
Pria's trying to hack
into the server farm.

00:41.530 --> 00:43.899
- You have to stop her.
- It's gone.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.975
Because of you, we couldn't stop her,

00:45.976 --> 00:47.060
and now it's all gone.

00:47.070 --> 00:48.840
- We gotta fix this.
- How?

00:48.850 --> 00:52.449
The God Account just sent
me a new Friend Suggestion.

00:52.450 --> 00:53.709
Simon Hayes.

01:00.890 --> 01:02.500
Okay, wait. Let me get this straight.

01:03.290 --> 01:07.145
You're fired, you're fired,
and you're probably fired.

01:07.146 --> 01:09.139
Yep, that about sums it up.

01:09.140 --> 01:11.180
Turns out, Simon Hayes isn't
behind the God Account.

01:11.730 --> 01:13.300
He actually created a code

01:13.310 --> 01:15.859
that could possibly end
global warming one day.

01:15.860 --> 01:19.649
Okay, so if Simon Hayes isn't
behind the God Account,

01:19.650 --> 01:21.519
does that mean Henry Chase is?

01:21.520 --> 01:25.569
No idea, and right now
it doesn't matter.

01:25.570 --> 01:26.600
This is our fault.

01:27.700 --> 01:29.619
We need to make things right.

01:29.620 --> 01:31.749
The God Account thinks we can help Simon

01:31.750 --> 01:34.145
and that is exactly
what we're going to do.

01:34.146 --> 01:36.969
Okay, but how? His code is gone.

01:36.970 --> 01:39.740
True, but that doesn't
mean it can't be rebuilt.

01:40.930 --> 01:43.150
Its foundation is the Juliet code,

01:43.160 --> 01:46.060
and the person who created
it is Henry Chase.

01:46.062 --> 01:48.769
That's who we have to find.

01:48.770 --> 01:51.859
Okay, so just so we're
clear, we need to track down

01:51.860 --> 01:54.899
a reclusive genius that no one
has seen in over a decade

01:54.900 --> 01:57.079
and reunite him with his sworn enemy

01:57.080 --> 01:59.720
so that they can possibly
save the world one day?

01:59.729 --> 02:01.259
Yeah. I think everything

02:01.260 --> 02:03.299
that we have doing has led us to this.

02:03.300 --> 02:05.389
We have to get this one
right, and we can,

02:05.390 --> 02:08.098
but only if we do it together.

02:08.100 --> 02:09.239
Y'all up for this?

02:19.250 --> 02:22.479
Dad, can you stop pacing?
You're making me nervous.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.395
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

02:24.396 --> 02:26.939
Election results are
coming in any minute.

02:26.940 --> 02:28.728
I'm just anxious is all.

02:28.729 --> 02:31.289
Dad, no matter what happens,
we're here for you.

02:31.290 --> 02:33.479
Arthur.

02:35.530 --> 02:36.645
So?

02:36.646 --> 02:39.379
We just got word from the diocese.

02:39.380 --> 02:42.340
Unfortunately, they're going
with Reverend Thompson.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.074

02:51.100 --> 02:52.240
I'm sorry, Dad.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.330
I know Reverend Thompson.
He's a good man

02:55.340 --> 02:57.699
and he'll be an excellent bishop.

02:57.700 --> 02:59.960
So thank you, Diana, Lester,

03:00.020 --> 03:02.310
for all that you've done.

03:06.780 --> 03:10.240
Are you okay, Arthur?

03:11.690 --> 03:16.186
Um, fine.

03:16.187 --> 03:18.145
Are you sure there's no
way to save your job?

03:18.146 --> 03:19.969
If you had written that article

03:19.970 --> 03:21.680
saying Simon Hayes was
behind the God Account,

03:21.690 --> 03:22.936
"Catapult" could've been sued.

03:22.937 --> 03:24.819
I know, and I told Wilson Hughes

03:24.820 --> 03:26.811
that exact same thing
right before he fired me.

03:26.812 --> 03:29.479
But, you know, it's... it's fine,

03:29.480 --> 03:31.520
'cause everything happens
for a reason, right?

03:31.521 --> 03:33.999
Hold on.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.479
Do you already have a gig lined up?

03:36.480 --> 03:38.619
I may have gotten an email

03:38.620 --> 03:40.645
from a book publisher this morning.

03:40.646 --> 03:42.879
She's been reading my
articles, and she thinks

03:42.880 --> 03:44.239
that the stories I've been
writing would make for

03:44.240 --> 03:45.429
an amazing nonfiction book.

03:45.430 --> 03:46.600
That's amazing.

03:49.890 --> 03:52.539
Oh. Hey.

03:52.540 --> 03:54.499
- Any luck tracking down Henry?
- Not yet.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.499
We're on our way to talk to Simon.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.290
I know we're the last
people he wants to see,

03:58.300 --> 04:00.060
but he might be the only
one to help us find Henry.

04:00.062 --> 04:02.187
Yeah. Okay, well good
luck and call me after.

04:02.188 --> 04:03.620
See ya.

04:05.230 --> 04:07.859
So, uh, you want to talk about it?

04:07.860 --> 04:08.949
Talk about what?

04:08.950 --> 04:11.039
Dude, last night you told me

04:11.040 --> 04:12.259
you were in love with Cara.

04:12.260 --> 04:14.699
You can't just drop an
epic bombshell like that

04:14.700 --> 04:15.829
and act like it's no big deal.

04:15.830 --> 04:18.060
Okay, it's a big deal.

04:18.062 --> 04:19.749
Yeah, it is.

04:19.750 --> 04:22.145
I mean, man, I had no idea
you felt that way about her.

04:22.146 --> 04:24.839
You know, the crazy part about it is

04:24.840 --> 04:26.969
I've never been so
certain about anything.

04:26.970 --> 04:29.969
Well, that's great, man.
What's the problem?

04:29.970 --> 04:31.059
I don't know.

04:31.060 --> 04:34.719
Yo, like, what if it's too fast?

04:34.720 --> 04:36.539
Right? What if she
doesn't feel the same?

04:36.540 --> 04:37.920
But what if she does?

04:38.810 --> 04:40.699
If you don't put yourself out there,

04:40.700 --> 04:41.969
you'll never know.

04:52.450 --> 04:54.219
I thought I made it
pretty clear last night

04:54.220 --> 04:56.560
that I never wanted to see
either one of you again.

04:56.562 --> 04:58.219
We came to apologize, Simon.

04:58.220 --> 04:59.879
To make things right.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.019
But we think there is a way

05:01.020 --> 05:02.569
that you can still rebuild your code.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.179
Trust me. I can't.

05:04.180 --> 05:05.353
Without the original code,

05:05.354 --> 05:07.645
there is absolutely
no way to rebuild it.

05:07.646 --> 05:09.103
You mean the Juliet code?

05:09.104 --> 05:11.749
Pria.

05:11.750 --> 05:13.619
She said you stole the
Juliet code from Henry,

05:13.620 --> 05:15.319
and she couldn't sit back any longer

05:15.320 --> 05:16.890
and watch you profit off of his work.

05:16.896 --> 05:18.799
Well, that makes two of us,

05:18.800 --> 05:20.820
because I had no intention
of profiting off of it.

05:20.840 --> 05:22.840
Wait, what do you mean?

05:22.850 --> 05:24.809
I've been testing this code

05:24.810 --> 05:26.659
for eight months, okay?

05:26.660 --> 05:28.850
The results have been revolutionary.

05:28.854 --> 05:31.939
Last month, the code
predicted a flash flood

05:31.940 --> 05:34.540
in the Hudson River basin
down to the minute.

05:34.550 --> 05:37.819
Once I realized I had something
that could save lives,

05:37.820 --> 05:39.689
I didn't want to sell it.

05:39.690 --> 05:41.019
I wanted to give it away.

05:41.020 --> 05:42.920
That's what you wanted
to announce at the gala.

05:42.940 --> 05:45.520
Yes. When Henry created the code,

05:45.521 --> 05:47.890
he wanted to share it with the world

05:47.900 --> 05:49.959
in the hopes that people
would work together

05:49.960 --> 05:52.709
to help each other out.

05:52.710 --> 05:55.620
And that's...

05:55.630 --> 05:56.978
what I was gonna do last night.

05:56.979 --> 05:58.669
It was your way of reaching out

05:58.670 --> 06:00.499
to Henry to apologize.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.079
I've been looking for him for years.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.450
After what I did,

06:04.480 --> 06:06.970
I knew it was gonna take more
than just, uh, an apology.

06:06.979 --> 06:08.619
That's why we have to find Henry,

06:08.620 --> 06:11.270
so you both can rebuild
what you lost together.

06:11.271 --> 06:12.769
Even if you could find him...

06:12.770 --> 06:14.859
which you can't... he's not gonna help.

06:14.860 --> 06:17.819
Besides, I, uh...

06:17.820 --> 06:19.645
I have a more pressing matter
that I have to deal with.

06:19.646 --> 06:22.519
W... what's that?

06:22.520 --> 06:24.159
My board has called an emergency meeting

06:24.160 --> 06:25.999
in which I will no doubt
be defending my job.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.609
I gotta get back to Palo Alto.

06:27.610 --> 06:28.959
I really wish it had worked out,

06:28.960 --> 06:30.395
but it didn't.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.359
Simon leaves for Palo Alto tomorrow,

06:37.360 --> 06:39.100
which means we have to find Henry quick.

06:39.104 --> 06:40.579
And still no word on Pria?

06:40.580 --> 06:41.895
She's totally off the grid.

06:41.896 --> 06:43.959
There must be something we're missing.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.889
A clue that we're not seeing.

06:45.890 --> 06:47.979
Yeah, maybe you're right.

06:47.980 --> 06:49.550
I mean, Henry's been at the
center of the God Account

06:49.560 --> 06:50.719
since the beginning.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.059
Maybe that clue is one of
our Friend Suggestions?

06:53.060 --> 06:54.619
Yeah, it's a good thought,

06:54.620 --> 06:57.396
but none of our Friend
Suggestions even knew Henry.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.079
Actually, one did.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.440
Graham Hastings.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.459
He played chess against
Henry's computer program

07:05.460 --> 07:06.970
- when he was at Columbia.
- That's right.

07:06.979 --> 07:09.699
And he was the one who told
us Falken was Henry Chase.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.603
We thought that was all he
knew, but maybe we were wrong.

07:11.604 --> 07:13.353
There's only one way to find out.

07:15.220 --> 07:16.879
Checkmate.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.099
- Graham.
- Miles.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.839
- Great to see you guys.
- So good to see you too.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.929
Looks like you rediscovered
your love for chess.

07:24.930 --> 07:26.719
I never realized how much I missed it

07:26.720 --> 07:28.120
until I started playing again.

07:28.930 --> 07:32.849
I read, uh, Xander passed a
few months ago. I'm sorry.

07:32.850 --> 07:34.819
Thank you. I was lucky enough

07:34.820 --> 07:36.040
to be there with him in the end.

07:36.060 --> 07:38.100
And I've kept my promise.

07:38.104 --> 07:39.939
I teach Annabelle every
day after school,

07:39.940 --> 07:42.139
though, sometimes she feels
more like the teacher

07:42.140 --> 07:43.179
than the student.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.219
So what brings you guys down here?

07:46.220 --> 07:47.699
Well, last time we spoke to each other,

07:47.700 --> 07:49.603
you mentioned that you knew Henry Chase.

07:49.604 --> 07:51.978
- That's right.
- We really need to get in touch with him.

07:51.979 --> 07:54.228
We're kind of hoping you'd
know where he'd be.

07:54.229 --> 07:57.228
Sorry, I haven't seen Henry
since he disappeared.

07:57.229 --> 07:58.309
Wait, if that's the case,

07:58.310 --> 08:00.879
then how did you know he became Falken?

08:00.880 --> 08:02.729
No one knew his true identity.

08:05.730 --> 08:08.719
Look, Henry values his privacy.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.379
He doesn't want to be found.

08:10.380 --> 08:13.799
Graham, we wouldn't be here
if this was not important.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.520
When's the last time you heard from him?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.311
Two days ago.

08:29.229 --> 08:31.059
Okay, wait, let me get this straight,

08:31.060 --> 08:33.100
you heard from Henry Chase two days ago?

08:33.104 --> 08:35.349
That's right. We played chess.

08:35.350 --> 08:37.299
He's in New York?

08:37.299 --> 08:38.919
Honestly, I have no idea.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.619
Wait, how do you have no idea?

08:40.620 --> 08:42.320
Because you guys play online.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.009
How long have you guys been in touch?

08:45.010 --> 08:48.359
Ever since I played chess
against his computer program.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.900
He had a love for the
game. We became friends.

08:50.910 --> 08:52.979
You know, if we know
when Henry's online,

08:52.980 --> 08:56.629
I can just try and trace his
IP address, find his location.

08:56.630 --> 08:58.459
You think you could set up a game?

08:58.460 --> 09:00.320
Look, I want to help,

09:00.340 --> 09:04.589
but Henry was a friend
when I really needed one.

09:04.590 --> 09:05.890
I don't want to betray his trust.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.629
Henry went underground,

09:07.630 --> 09:10.059
because he had a falling-out
with his best friend.

09:10.060 --> 09:11.979
Now together they were
going to change the world.

09:11.980 --> 09:13.440
We think they still can.

09:14.220 --> 09:17.209
But only if we can bring
them back together,

09:17.210 --> 09:19.280
like we did for you and Aleksander.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.709
I'll send Henry a message.

09:24.710 --> 09:26.419
- All right.
- I'll text you a time.

09:26.420 --> 09:27.940
Thank you.

09:29.470 --> 09:31.399
All right, well, I'm
gonna go grab my laptop.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.859
I'll see you guys at your place, yeah?

09:32.860 --> 09:34.590
Cool.

09:37.740 --> 09:40.729
So how's your job search going?

09:40.730 --> 09:43.779
Um, surprisingly well.

09:43.780 --> 09:45.299
A publisher contacted me

09:45.300 --> 09:46.909
about turning my articles into a book.

09:46.910 --> 09:49.779
- That's amazing!
- Yeah, I know.

09:49.780 --> 09:51.829
I mean, I've always wanted to
write something like this.

09:51.830 --> 09:53.869
I... I still can't believe it.

09:53.870 --> 09:55.829
I can.

09:55.830 --> 09:57.099
You're a talented writer.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.580
I knew things would work out for you.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.200
Do you feel the same about us?

10:02.450 --> 10:03.540
I do.

10:04.530 --> 10:07.799
Good. 'Cause...

10:07.800 --> 10:10.019
I think we should keep taking it slow,

10:10.020 --> 10:12.299
not risk screwing it up again.

10:12.300 --> 10:13.860
Is that okay?

10:16.260 --> 10:18.199
Yeah.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.899
It's okay.

10:33.520 --> 10:36.719
Uh, Christina from FreeVerse?

10:36.720 --> 10:38.429
She says we need to meet. It's urgent.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.499
Yeah, yeah, go.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.640
Rakesh and I can meet you at your place.

10:41.650 --> 10:43.079
Okay.

10:48.740 --> 10:51.399
Steak burger, medium rare, crispy fries.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.800
Thank you, sweetheart.

10:59.060 --> 11:00.859
You want to talk about it?

11:00.860 --> 11:03.520
There's...

11:03.570 --> 11:05.539
Nothing to talk about.

11:05.540 --> 11:08.019
And it was an election.
Someone had to lose.

11:08.020 --> 11:09.600
Then what is it?

11:15.900 --> 11:19.009
What does it say about me

11:19.010 --> 11:20.519
that the election board

11:20.520 --> 11:23.319
doesn't have any faith in my leadership?

11:23.320 --> 11:26.279
How will my parishioners view me now?

11:26.280 --> 11:29.470
They're gonna view you the
way they always have.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.959
As the man they turn to for hope,

11:32.960 --> 11:34.529
guidance, and leadership.

11:34.530 --> 11:38.460
Then why do I feel like I'm
not that man any longer?

11:39.200 --> 11:42.100
Because you were prepared to move on,

11:42.110 --> 11:46.240
and you just need some time to
settle back into your old life.

11:46.880 --> 11:51.999
And what if my old life
turns out to be just that?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.879
Then you will find a way to make it new.

11:57.180 --> 11:58.760
Thanks for meeting me.

11:58.770 --> 12:00.300
I'll get right to the point, Miles.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.560
Okay.

12:01.570 --> 12:03.619
We received a cease-and-desist letter

12:03.620 --> 12:05.260
from Singular Dynamics.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.659
They're threatening to sue us

12:06.660 --> 12:08.899
for defamation of their
CEO, Simon Hayes,

12:08.900 --> 12:11.340
if we don't take your podcast down.

12:11.350 --> 12:13.499
I don't understand.
How can they do that?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.139
Well, they're claiming
you and your friends

12:15.140 --> 12:17.359
hacked their servers
and destroyed valuable

12:17.360 --> 12:19.630
intellectual property because
you thought Simon Hayes

12:19.640 --> 12:20.760
was behind the God Account.

12:20.770 --> 12:22.819
Okay, first of all, we
didn't destroy anything.

12:22.820 --> 12:23.899
It was someone named Pria Amar,

12:23.900 --> 12:25.679
and secondly, my friends and I

12:25.680 --> 12:27.079
are trying to help Simon right now.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.339
Look, the Board of Singular
Dynamics is clearly

12:30.340 --> 12:32.459
doing damage control after last night,

12:32.460 --> 12:34.959
and we don't have the
resources to take on

12:34.960 --> 12:37.860
a billion-dollar company
with an army of lawyers.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.140
What are you saying?

12:39.160 --> 12:40.319
We're pulling your podcast

12:40.320 --> 12:42.399
and won't be putting it back on.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.399
- Miles?
- Yeah, Rakesh, what's up?

12:46.400 --> 12:47.739
Just heard from Graham.

12:47.740 --> 12:49.799
Uh, Henry's going to be
online in half an hour.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.329
- You need to get back here.
- Okay.

12:51.330 --> 12:53.039
- I'm on my way.
- Hey, you okay?

12:53.040 --> 12:54.159
How'd everything go with FreeVerse?

12:54.160 --> 12:55.949
Not good.

12:55.950 --> 12:59.199
Um, Singular Dynamics
is suing FreeVerse.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.289
They're shutting down my podcast.

13:01.290 --> 13:02.909
I'm so sorry, Miles.

13:02.910 --> 13:05.249
You know, if the board finds
out we're still meddling

13:05.250 --> 13:06.809
in Simon's life, they
might come after us

13:06.810 --> 13:07.879
in a much more serious way

13:07.880 --> 13:09.440
than just shutting down your podcast.

13:10.350 --> 13:12.260
The God Account has
never steered us wrong.

13:12.270 --> 13:13.760
Okay, we have to stay the course,

13:13.770 --> 13:15.540
no matter the consequences.

13:15.580 --> 13:17.420
Yeah, absolutely.

13:20.020 --> 13:21.989
Guys, you're not gonna believe this.

13:21.990 --> 13:23.699
I just found Pria. She's
getting into a car,

13:23.700 --> 13:25.980
- about to take off.
- Miles, you need to follow her.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.239
- She might help us locate Henry.
- Yeah, no kidding.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.860
Hey! Hey!

13:34.210 --> 13:37.899
Oh! Taxi! Taxi!

13:37.900 --> 13:38.920
Damn it.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.359
Miles.

13:46.360 --> 13:47.989
Hasan?

13:47.990 --> 13:49.449
I thought it was you.

13:49.450 --> 13:51.679
Hey, uh, Hasan, I need
to follow that car.

13:51.680 --> 13:52.869
Any chance you can give me a lift?

13:52.870 --> 13:54.760
- Hop in.
- Thank you.

13:59.790 --> 14:01.359
- Uh, Miles.
- Uh-huh.

14:01.360 --> 14:02.819
The car we are following

14:02.820 --> 14:05.159
has something to do with God's Account?

14:05.160 --> 14:06.959
Uh, something like that.

14:06.960 --> 14:10.099
Ah, that reminds me.
Send me your address.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.080
The invitations are
going out in two weeks

14:12.100 --> 14:13.859
for Tarah and David's wedding.

14:13.860 --> 14:16.020
- You're inviting me?
- Of course.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.869
And Cara and Rakesh.

14:17.870 --> 14:19.859
If it wasn't because of you,

14:19.860 --> 14:21.299
Tarah would have eloped,

14:21.300 --> 14:22.859
and I would've missed the chance

14:22.860 --> 14:23.909
to give my daughter away.

14:23.910 --> 14:26.990
Well, I'm just glad we
were able to help you two

14:27.000 --> 14:28.859
find the path to get back to each other.

14:28.860 --> 14:33.459
Speaking of finding your
path to somewhere...

14:33.460 --> 14:34.990
how's Cara?

14:35.790 --> 14:37.439
What do you mean?

14:37.440 --> 14:39.519
Miles.

14:39.520 --> 14:42.479
I may have been blind to
Tarah and David's love,

14:42.480 --> 14:44.640
but you and Cara?

14:45.850 --> 14:48.890
We're good, we're good. It's just, um...

14:51.730 --> 14:53.519
She wants to take things slow.

14:53.520 --> 14:54.690
And you don't?

14:54.740 --> 14:57.020
No.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.159
I guess not.

14:59.160 --> 15:02.379
Miles...

15:02.380 --> 15:05.469
you were the one who
showed me how important

15:05.470 --> 15:09.169
love is in someone's life.

15:09.170 --> 15:12.080
If that's how you feel,
you should tell her.

15:14.220 --> 15:16.160
Oh, you can pull over out here.

15:26.140 --> 15:27.679
Thanks, Hasan.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.239
Please tell Tarah and
David I said hello.

15:29.240 --> 15:31.359
I will. Please don't forget

15:31.360 --> 15:33.810
to send me your address, okay?

15:43.620 --> 15:45.779
I'd say I'm surprised to see you,

15:45.780 --> 15:48.520
but I imagine you've
been looking for me.

15:48.540 --> 15:50.860
I'm sorry, Miles.

15:50.920 --> 15:53.619
I know what the God
Account meant to you,

15:53.620 --> 15:55.699
but it's the only way I could
prove myself to Henry.

15:55.700 --> 15:58.120
Pria, that was not the God
Account you destroyed.

15:58.710 --> 16:00.299
What?

16:00.300 --> 16:03.199
Simon's project was a
code designed to predict

16:03.200 --> 16:05.219
natural disasters before they happen,

16:05.220 --> 16:08.260
his way of using the Juliet
code to help people.

16:08.270 --> 16:11.450
Just like what Henry always wanted.

16:11.460 --> 16:13.080
I had no idea,

16:13.100 --> 16:16.560
but unfortunately, it can't be undone.

16:16.680 --> 16:19.549
No, but the God Account
sent us Simon's name,

16:19.550 --> 16:21.919
which means it can be fixed.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.739
We just need to find Henry.

16:23.740 --> 16:25.539
He's the only one that
can help rebuild it.

16:25.540 --> 16:26.980
I'd love to be able to help you,

16:27.000 --> 16:30.440
but if Henry hasn't reached
out already, he never will.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.760
Is that why you're here?

16:33.790 --> 16:35.160
Praying for Henry to come back?

16:35.170 --> 16:37.130
No.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.100
I'm praying for more time.

16:40.140 --> 16:41.760
What do you mean?

16:44.640 --> 16:45.799
I'm sick.

16:47.260 --> 16:48.580
Leukemia.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.880
I thought I'd beaten it,
but it's come back.

16:55.040 --> 16:57.240
I'm afraid there's nothing
more the doctors can do.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.340
I'm sorry.

16:59.400 --> 17:03.339
I've spent the last few months

17:03.340 --> 17:04.940
making peace with it.

17:06.400 --> 17:11.040
There's a lot of things I can
reconcile in life, but...

17:11.099 --> 17:14.040
not what happened with Henry.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.260
That's why I've been so
desperate to find him.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.800
To make things right.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.878
It's not only that.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.339
I love him.

17:28.349 --> 17:29.920
I always have.

17:31.510 --> 17:33.140
I never told him.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.460
Looking back...

17:38.480 --> 17:41.540
that's the biggest regret I have.

17:42.800 --> 17:46.140
If I had, then maybe he would've stayed.

17:48.860 --> 17:51.280
I think I'm supposed
to help you do that.

17:52.340 --> 17:54.869
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

17:54.870 --> 17:56.829
But the God Account
gave you Simon's name.

17:56.830 --> 18:00.779
Yeah, but I think it wants
us to help the three of you.

18:00.780 --> 18:04.529
I think you're supposed to come with me.

18:07.710 --> 18:10.139
Henry's not running any
sort of encryption program,

18:10.140 --> 18:11.319
probably 'cause he assumes

18:11.320 --> 18:13.260
nobody is watching him play chess,

18:13.270 --> 18:15.240
so I should have his location
in a couple minutes,

18:15.250 --> 18:17.889
as long as you keep her 10 feet away

18:17.890 --> 18:20.060
from my computer at all times.

18:22.690 --> 18:24.580
- Happy?
- Yeah, that's better.

18:27.980 --> 18:29.989
Everything okay?

18:29.990 --> 18:32.479
Yeah, I just got an email
from that book publisher.

18:32.480 --> 18:35.280
Wilson Hughes reached out
to them and told them

18:35.300 --> 18:37.439
that my articles were
property of "Catapult,"

18:37.440 --> 18:38.869
and that any book based on them

18:38.870 --> 18:41.080
- is an infringement of copyright.
- Are you kidding?

18:41.100 --> 18:42.800
No, no... they canceled my meeting.

18:42.820 --> 18:45.919
Oh, Cara, I'm... I'm sorry.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.789
Yeah, me too. I mean,

18:47.790 --> 18:50.259
I thought I was finally gonna
be able to write a book.

18:50.260 --> 18:53.489
Uh, guys, I just got a
hit on Henry's location.

18:53.490 --> 18:55.749
He's here in New York.

18:55.750 --> 18:57.400
My God.

18:57.410 --> 18:59.839
I might actually be able to
see him again. Where is he?

18:59.840 --> 19:01.789
That's the thing. He...

19:01.790 --> 19:03.260
He's at Identity Seal.

19:03.850 --> 19:06.280
What the hell is he doing there?

19:14.660 --> 19:16.200
No sign of Henry.

19:16.210 --> 19:19.219
I don't understand. He should be here.

19:19.220 --> 19:22.380
Well, maybe you got it wrong.

19:24.670 --> 19:27.920
I got a bad feeling about this.

19:29.890 --> 19:33.010
What the hell is going on?

19:33.040 --> 19:34.240
Hello, Simon.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.449
Pria, right.

19:38.450 --> 19:39.669
Should've guessed.

19:39.670 --> 19:40.839
What are you all doing here?

19:40.840 --> 19:42.099
We were looking for Henry

19:42.100 --> 19:43.139
and we traced him here.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.979
Look, the last place Henry is gonna be,

19:44.980 --> 19:46.800
is at any of my companies. Trust me.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.500
He's right about that.

19:55.260 --> 19:56.460
Henry.

19:58.490 --> 20:00.379
I knew you wouldn't stop looking for me,

20:00.380 --> 20:02.520
so I thought we should all talk.

20:12.140 --> 20:13.720
You know who we are?

20:13.740 --> 20:15.349
I know everything.

20:15.350 --> 20:16.660
Are you behind the God Account?

20:16.700 --> 20:18.439
No.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.719
I had no idea who any of you were,

20:20.720 --> 20:22.719
until you broke into
my parents' apartment

20:22.720 --> 20:23.780
a few months back.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.799
Wait, you were there?

20:25.800 --> 20:28.919
I saw you through the
building security feed.

20:28.920 --> 20:31.180
And once I figured out who they were,

20:31.220 --> 20:34.039
I hacked into Miles's computer
and saw the God Account,

20:34.040 --> 20:36.069
and I've been watching you ever since.

20:36.070 --> 20:37.589
When Graham reached out today,

20:37.590 --> 20:39.129
you realized it was us.

20:39.130 --> 20:41.590
That's why you agreed to
play, to lead us here.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.430
I needed to put an end to all of this

20:43.460 --> 20:45.740
before it got started.

20:45.750 --> 20:47.570
I will never help you, Simon.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.739
Yeah. You made that pretty clear

20:49.740 --> 20:51.349
when you tried to destroy
my code the first time.

20:51.350 --> 20:52.620
Well, did you tell them why?

20:53.210 --> 20:55.240
Did you tell them the
kind of man you are?

20:55.260 --> 20:58.699
Yeah, I stole your code,

20:58.700 --> 21:01.239
and I know you're not gonna help me,

21:01.240 --> 21:02.530
but I'm not that man anymore.

21:02.540 --> 21:05.499
You were trying to profit
from my work last night

21:05.500 --> 21:07.489
like you always wanted
to from the start.

21:07.490 --> 21:11.019
No, I was gonna give
your work away for free,

21:11.020 --> 21:12.740
just like you wanted to from the start.

21:12.750 --> 21:14.680
- It's true.
- It's not.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.560
All he cares about is himself.

21:16.570 --> 21:17.900
That's not true, Henry.

21:19.140 --> 21:21.459
Five years ago,

21:21.460 --> 21:24.029
I was diagnosed with Leukemia.

21:24.030 --> 21:27.100
If it wasn't for Simon, I would've died.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.620
You're the one he donated
his bone marrow to.

21:33.580 --> 21:36.020
And even though the
cancer has come back,

21:36.040 --> 21:39.480
if it wasn't for Simon, I
wouldn't be alive today.

21:39.520 --> 21:40.760
It came back?

21:43.240 --> 21:47.300
The point is, he saved me.

21:47.360 --> 21:50.579
Look, the three of you set
out to do something special.

21:50.580 --> 21:51.720
It's not too late.

21:52.890 --> 21:55.280
Nah, it is.

21:55.300 --> 21:57.019
I'm sorry, um,

21:57.020 --> 21:59.379
just please stay away.
That's all I want.

22:09.140 --> 22:13.729
Look, Simon and Pria clearly
want to reconcile with Henry.

22:13.730 --> 22:15.520
Yeah, but Henry's still
stuck in the past,

22:15.560 --> 22:17.559
still angry over what drove them apart.

22:17.560 --> 22:18.860
Yeah, I don't think it's anger.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.439
I think it's fear.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.820
He lost the two people that
meant the most to him.

22:23.420 --> 22:25.049
Yeah, that's true.

22:28.020 --> 22:30.929
Th... the God Account
just sent a reminder.

22:30.930 --> 22:33.760
Please save the date for the
Bat Mitzvah of Erica Katz.

22:33.810 --> 22:35.740
- Who's Erica Katz?
- I have no clue,

22:35.750 --> 22:38.549
but she has a Bat Mitzvah
tomorrow at Sinai Temple.

22:38.550 --> 22:40.079
Wait, how is going to a Bat Mitzvah

22:40.080 --> 22:41.840
supposed to help us convince Henry

22:41.860 --> 22:43.460
to repair his relationship with Simon?

22:43.470 --> 22:45.240
I don't know, but the God
Account thinks it can.

22:45.260 --> 22:49.039
Simon leaves town tomorrow,
so this is our last chance.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.609
Whatever is going on down there,

22:50.610 --> 22:52.389
I think they all need to see it.

22:52.390 --> 22:54.879
You guys reach out to Pria and Simon,

22:54.880 --> 22:56.269
I will text Graham.

22:56.270 --> 22:58.020
Hopefully, he can get
a message to Henry.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.579
- Cool. See ya.
- Yeah. See ya.

23:05.570 --> 23:07.369
Hey, hey. What's up?

23:07.370 --> 23:09.939
I know you have a lot going
on with the God Account,

23:09.940 --> 23:12.289
but Dad is taking his loss pretty hard.

23:12.290 --> 23:14.330
I've given him some space,

23:14.340 --> 23:16.319
but I think this might be a good time

23:16.320 --> 23:18.579
for a father-son talk.

23:18.580 --> 23:20.220
Yeah, you're right.

23:20.240 --> 23:22.599
He's been there a lot for me lately.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.580
It's time that I'm there for him.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.840
Mind if I join you?

23:29.180 --> 23:32.089
Of course not. Um...

23:32.090 --> 23:35.659
everything okay with your
latest Friend Suggestion?

23:37.210 --> 23:39.599
Challenging, but

23:39.600 --> 23:41.420
that's not what I came
to talk to you about.

23:42.960 --> 23:44.780
What's going on, Dad?

23:48.950 --> 23:51.399
I am not really sure.

23:55.260 --> 23:56.800
I'm struggling, son.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.400
It's about the election?

24:00.830 --> 24:03.160
It's more than that.

24:04.010 --> 24:08.999
When you and I were at that
diner upstate yesterday,

24:09.000 --> 24:12.869
and I was reminded of the
decision that I made

24:12.870 --> 24:17.960
all those many years ago not to
take that interview in Chicago,

24:18.000 --> 24:21.319
I knew in my heart that
was the right decision,

24:21.320 --> 24:24.360
and it led to Harlem Episcopal.

24:25.770 --> 24:27.559
That feeling back then,

24:27.560 --> 24:32.329
that... kick in my heart,

24:32.330 --> 24:34.899
I had that same feeling
about the election.

24:34.900 --> 24:39.500
I was so certain

24:39.530 --> 24:42.999
becoming Bishop was the next step

24:43.000 --> 24:44.680
in my path.

24:48.120 --> 24:52.450
That choice you made
all those years ago,

24:52.460 --> 24:56.440
it wasn't about leading
you to Harlem Episcopal.

24:56.460 --> 24:58.540
It was about leading you back to Mom.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.940
Maybe you weren't wrong

25:03.960 --> 25:07.540
about the feeling you were having.

25:07.550 --> 25:10.540
Maybe you were wrong about what
it was trying to tell you.

25:18.680 --> 25:19.899
When did you get so smart?

25:19.900 --> 25:21.400
Hmm.

25:23.070 --> 25:24.989
Well,

25:24.990 --> 25:27.700
it's all about knowing what you want.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.820
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

25:36.100 --> 25:38.940
How did you and Cara do
convincing Simon and Pria?

25:38.960 --> 25:41.049
Well, uh... they were
both a little confused

25:41.050 --> 25:43.439
by the idea of crashing
someone's Bat Mitzvah,

25:43.440 --> 25:46.529
but if there's a chance
they can get Henry back,

25:46.530 --> 25:48.560
they said they're willing to go along.

25:48.570 --> 25:49.919
Any word from Graham?

25:49.920 --> 25:51.489
No, I texted him earlier,

25:51.490 --> 25:52.839
but I haven't heard anything back yet.

25:52.840 --> 25:54.319
Not sure what else I can do.

25:54.320 --> 25:57.409
Yeah, too bad you can't
just text the God Account,

25:57.410 --> 25:58.920
ask for a little help.

26:02.960 --> 26:05.939
Maybe I can. I'll call you right back.

26:10.540 --> 26:12.020
_

26:15.020 --> 26:19.420
_

26:30.090 --> 26:32.079
_

26:52.010 --> 26:53.180
How'd you find me?

26:53.720 --> 26:55.640
A little help from the God Account.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.520
What do you want, Miles?

26:57.560 --> 26:59.779
I want you to come with me.

26:59.780 --> 27:00.940
Where?

27:02.970 --> 27:05.960
To Erica Katz's Bat Mitzvah.

27:05.980 --> 27:07.610
Hm.

27:10.370 --> 27:12.640
You really believe in
that God Account, huh?

27:12.720 --> 27:15.120
In helping people?

27:15.140 --> 27:17.420
I used to be a believer too.

27:19.150 --> 27:20.680
I think you still are,

27:20.720 --> 27:23.369
or at least you want to be.

27:23.370 --> 27:25.760
You just can't let yourself.

27:27.190 --> 27:31.640
I was there the day my sister died.

27:34.220 --> 27:38.139
I was 10 feet away from her

27:38.140 --> 27:42.039
before the flash flood hit.

27:51.120 --> 27:53.000
I couldn't save her.

28:00.070 --> 28:03.099
That's why I created the Juliet code,

28:03.100 --> 28:05.400
to stop something like
that from happening,

28:05.410 --> 28:09.080
and it never did, and it never will.

28:09.820 --> 28:14.549
So what good is the future if
you cannot fix the mistakes

28:14.550 --> 28:16.320
of the... of the past?

28:18.040 --> 28:20.579
You need to come with me.

28:20.580 --> 28:24.600
I think there's something
there you're supposed to see.

28:25.970 --> 28:28.380
It sounds like you're
asking me to have faith.

28:31.190 --> 28:33.920
No, I'm asking you to trust me.

28:44.660 --> 28:46.720
I have to be at a board
meeting in a few hours

28:46.750 --> 28:50.040
that decides my future, and I'm
at Erica Katz's Bat Mitzvah.

28:50.060 --> 28:52.819
Hey, you're in temple.
Have a little faith.

28:52.820 --> 28:54.100
Mm.

28:54.550 --> 28:55.820
Hey, guys.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.460
Henry.

29:03.220 --> 29:04.299
I'm glad you came.

29:04.300 --> 29:07.329
Yeah, well, Miles was pretty convincing,

29:07.330 --> 29:11.379
plus, I'm more than curious
what we're gonna find here.

29:11.380 --> 29:13.069
Miles?

29:13.070 --> 29:14.899
- Zoe?
- What are you doing here?

29:14.900 --> 29:16.990
Oh, I forgot this is your temple.

29:17.040 --> 29:18.429
It is.

29:18.430 --> 29:20.310
I'm a little confused.

29:20.340 --> 29:21.899
Are you here for the Katz's Bat Mitzvah?

29:21.900 --> 29:23.519
Yes, you can say that.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.659
It's about the God Account.

29:24.660 --> 29:26.779
It led me and my friends
here to Erica Katz.

29:26.780 --> 29:28.439
I see.

29:28.440 --> 29:29.959
Actually I'm not surprised
the God Account

29:29.960 --> 29:34.030
gave you Erica's name,
although you're a little late.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.659
- Uh, what do you mean?
- Erica nearly drowned

29:36.660 --> 29:39.100
last month on a family camping trip.

29:39.110 --> 29:42.629
It's a miracle she's even here today.

29:42.630 --> 29:44.629
Do you think we could talk to her?

29:44.630 --> 29:46.059
Of course.

29:46.060 --> 29:48.719
I'll introduce you. She
has an amazing story.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.690
Erica, Sharon.

29:52.390 --> 29:56.209
- This is Miles Finer.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

29:56.210 --> 29:57.599
- Hi.
- I want you to meet him

29:57.600 --> 29:59.080
and his friends.

29:59.100 --> 30:00.660
Hi.

30:00.710 --> 30:02.379
Would it be okay if they asked you

30:02.380 --> 30:03.640
about what happened last month?

30:04.060 --> 30:06.779
Ugh, we're so blessed.

30:06.780 --> 30:09.219
God was really looking
out for Erica that day.

30:09.220 --> 30:10.519
What do you mean?

30:10.520 --> 30:12.150
Uh, we were on a family camping trip,

30:12.160 --> 30:13.280
and there was a flash flood.

30:17.580 --> 30:18.659
Where were you?

30:18.660 --> 30:20.150
Hudson River basin.

30:20.160 --> 30:22.080
It's where we always go.

30:23.690 --> 30:26.819
You said your code predicted a
flash flood there last month.

30:26.820 --> 30:30.279
Yeah, we contacted the
local authorities,

30:30.280 --> 30:31.439
and they got the word out.

30:31.440 --> 30:35.460
Erica was down the river, swimming,

30:35.470 --> 30:38.599
and luckily,

30:38.600 --> 30:42.640
they pulled her out right
before the flood hit.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.909
Without that warning,

30:45.910 --> 30:47.739
she wouldn't be here.

30:53.020 --> 30:56.219
Simon and Henry are
the ones that came up

30:56.220 --> 30:58.570
with the technology that
predicted that flood.

31:03.110 --> 31:05.269
I do not know what to say.

31:08.030 --> 31:10.759
Because of you,

31:10.760 --> 31:13.660
I still have my daughter.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.380
You really did it, Simon.

31:21.740 --> 31:22.940
You did it.

31:22.980 --> 31:25.859
No, man, you did it.

31:44.270 --> 31:47.460
It's nice to meet you, Erica,

31:47.470 --> 31:50.449
and...

31:50.450 --> 31:52.040
I'm glad that you're okay.

31:54.360 --> 31:55.850
Thank you.

32:17.960 --> 32:20.699
Hey, I got your message. You
said you needed to talk.

32:20.700 --> 32:21.829
Is everything okay?

32:21.830 --> 32:24.650
Uh, yes. Um...

32:28.120 --> 32:29.690
But I... I do have news.

32:31.100 --> 32:33.119
After everything that's happened,

32:33.120 --> 32:37.160
I've been thinking a lot about
my place in the church.

32:37.170 --> 32:40.359
What my role should be moving forward,

32:40.360 --> 32:44.330
and after careful thought and prayer...

32:46.480 --> 32:48.100
I've come to a realization.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.580
Okay.

32:51.900 --> 32:53.400
For the past 25 years,

32:53.410 --> 32:56.200
I've led this church to
the best of my ability,

32:56.210 --> 32:58.460
but it is time for a new journey,

32:58.470 --> 33:00.990
so as of this morning,

33:01.040 --> 33:02.739
I've decided to step down

33:02.740 --> 33:05.220
as head priest of Harlem Episcopal.

33:06.090 --> 33:09.109
Wow. Arthur, are you sure?

33:09.110 --> 33:10.829
I've never been more certain,

33:10.830 --> 33:12.659
and I wouldn't be leaving

33:12.660 --> 33:15.620
if it wasn't in the good
hands of Reverend Carver.

33:19.240 --> 33:22.860
I've worn this collar

33:22.980 --> 33:25.020
for a very long time.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.899
Being a man of the cloth

33:28.900 --> 33:32.679
has been the great calling of my life.

33:38.240 --> 33:42.429
But I'm ready...

33:42.430 --> 33:45.139
to be just a man again.

33:45.140 --> 33:48.680
Ready to be just a father.

33:49.880 --> 33:51.559
And more than that,

33:51.560 --> 33:54.789
ready to be...

33:54.790 --> 33:56.739
just a husband.

34:00.180 --> 34:02.060
Arthur, what... what...
what are you saying?

34:02.070 --> 34:03.940
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.159
Trish, will you marry me?

34:14.030 --> 34:16.480
Um...

34:16.500 --> 34:17.739
For the record?

34:19.420 --> 34:20.679
Yes.

34:23.860 --> 34:25.139
It is about time

34:25.139 --> 34:27.059
the three of you ended up
here with some good news.

34:27.060 --> 34:28.400
Yeah, it's been a rough couple of days,

34:28.409 --> 34:29.570
but I'm glad it all worked out.

34:29.580 --> 34:32.049
I never had a doubt.

34:32.050 --> 34:34.440
Yeah, right.

34:35.179 --> 34:36.260
Hey.

34:39.239 --> 34:40.589
How'd it go with the board?

34:40.590 --> 34:41.668
Not very good.

34:41.670 --> 34:43.589
They said I'm out.

34:43.590 --> 34:45.799
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

34:45.800 --> 34:48.299
We're still gonna do everything I said.

34:48.300 --> 34:51.998
Simon and Pria are coming
back to Paris with me,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.719
and we're gonna rebuild
Simon's technology.

34:54.739 --> 34:56.300
And when we're done,

34:56.310 --> 34:57.759
we're gonna share it with the world.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.619
Just like we set out to do,

34:59.620 --> 35:02.440
and we couldn't have done it
without the three of you.

35:02.450 --> 35:05.740
That reminds me, I called
Christina from FreeVerse.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.619
- You did?
- Told her that, uh,

35:07.620 --> 35:09.889
if she had the, uh, podcast
back on her platform

35:09.890 --> 35:11.149
by the end of the day,
they'd be receiving

35:11.150 --> 35:13.119
a, uh, sizable angel investment,

35:13.120 --> 35:16.169
so FreeVerse is gonna reach
a far bigger audience,

35:16.170 --> 35:17.279
- and so are you, man.
- Thank you.

35:17.280 --> 35:18.760
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

35:19.160 --> 35:22.330
Uh, Rakesh, one of my last
acts as CEO was to create

35:22.340 --> 35:24.419
a new division at, uh, Identity Seal.

35:24.420 --> 35:26.009
R&D. You're gonna head it up.

35:27.540 --> 35:28.960
Thanks. What...

35:28.980 --> 35:30.259
what am I supposed to be working on?

35:30.260 --> 35:31.589
Anything you want.

35:31.590 --> 35:32.839
Okay.

35:32.840 --> 35:33.899
And then you.

35:33.900 --> 35:37.129
Um, somebody told me that
you had a book offer

35:37.130 --> 35:39.179
that your boss killed. Is that right?

35:39.180 --> 35:40.460
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

35:40.470 --> 35:42.669
- Still dead.
- Oh.

35:42.670 --> 35:45.619
But you're way too talented
to be recycling your articles

35:45.620 --> 35:47.009
into a book.

35:47.010 --> 35:48.589
You need a new story, and, uh,

35:48.590 --> 35:50.140
we want you to come to Paris with us.

35:50.710 --> 35:51.839
Wha...

35:51.840 --> 35:53.509
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

35:53.510 --> 35:55.629
Look, the next six months are
gonna lay the foundation

35:55.630 --> 35:57.799
for everything we're gonna do,

35:57.800 --> 36:00.019
and we want you to
write a book about it.

36:01.680 --> 36:04.579
I don't even know what
to say. Thank you.

36:04.580 --> 36:07.640
But I... I can't just move
to Paris on a whim, so...

36:07.660 --> 36:10.040
I get it. It's a big decision.

36:10.050 --> 36:12.420
Um, look, we leave in a couple of days.

36:12.440 --> 36:13.740
You let us know, all right?

36:15.120 --> 36:16.420
Buy me a beer?

36:16.440 --> 36:17.520
Yes, sir, of course.

36:17.680 --> 36:18.960
Miles.

36:21.060 --> 36:23.219
Thank you so much.

36:23.220 --> 36:25.090
Without you, I would
never have found Henry.

36:26.550 --> 36:29.139
Did you tell him how you feel?

36:29.140 --> 36:30.749
Well, seeing as we're all back together,

36:30.750 --> 36:33.139
- I'm not sure it matters.
- Of course it does.

36:33.140 --> 36:35.319
Look, he deserves to know,

36:35.320 --> 36:36.620
and you deserve to say it.

36:44.150 --> 36:46.419
Hey.

36:46.420 --> 36:49.040
There's something I need to tell you.

36:49.590 --> 36:51.069
What's up?

36:51.070 --> 36:55.880
Something I should have
said a long time ago.

36:57.510 --> 36:59.879
I love you, Henry.

36:59.880 --> 37:01.220
I always have.

37:02.840 --> 37:06.300
I just wish I'd told
you before you left.

37:07.180 --> 37:09.280
Hm.

37:09.300 --> 37:12.169
Well, I'm glad you finally did.

37:24.600 --> 37:25.959
That was crazy.

37:25.960 --> 37:28.540
Yeah.

37:30.610 --> 37:32.600
- Look, Miles...
- You have to go to Paris.

37:34.790 --> 37:37.579
It's an opportunity of a lifetime.

37:37.580 --> 37:39.979
Plus, you're the one that always said

37:39.980 --> 37:41.340
it was your dream to live there.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.540
What about us?

37:45.260 --> 37:46.580
I'll still be here,

37:47.800 --> 37:49.620
waiting to read your new book.

37:54.570 --> 37:56.099
So I'm moving to Paris, then.

37:56.100 --> 37:58.900
Yes, you are.

38:05.440 --> 38:08.329
Hey, can I get you guys
something to drink?

38:08.330 --> 38:10.750
Actually, I think drinks for everyone,

38:10.760 --> 38:12.899
and your best champagne, please.

38:12.900 --> 38:14.879
Oh, fancy. What's the occasion?

38:14.880 --> 38:16.579
Well, Trish and I come bearing news

38:16.580 --> 38:17.959
that we want to share with you.

38:17.960 --> 38:21.220
We are getting married!

38:23.430 --> 38:26.919
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

38:30.170 --> 38:33.119
Okay, okay, okay, drinks on the house!

38:39.700 --> 38:41.379
Welcome back to "The
Millennial Prophet."

38:41.380 --> 38:43.929
Today, I have a

38:43.930 --> 38:46.189
very special guest.

38:46.190 --> 38:48.759
Someone who I would've never
imagined would be sitting

38:48.760 --> 38:51.799
across from me when I
first started my podcast,

38:51.800 --> 38:55.110
but a lot has changed since then.

38:55.120 --> 38:58.329
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome

38:58.330 --> 39:01.019
my father,

39:01.020 --> 39:03.819
Lord Vader himself.

39:03.820 --> 39:05.500
Arthur Finer.

39:05.520 --> 39:08.599
Well, thank you, Miles, and
if I were being honest,

39:08.600 --> 39:10.669
I never expected to be sitting
across from you, either.

39:10.670 --> 39:12.860
- Yeah, what changed your mind?
- You did.

39:13.720 --> 39:16.219
I don't think you realize
how far you've come.

39:16.220 --> 39:18.049
What started out as a
critique of religion,

39:18.050 --> 39:22.799
has evolved into a conversation
about hope, about faith.

39:22.800 --> 39:25.059
Having faith in God and
having faith in people

39:25.060 --> 39:26.839
are two very different things.

39:26.840 --> 39:29.149
- Are they?
- Oh, here we go.

39:29.150 --> 39:30.739
Are you sure you left the pulpit,

39:30.740 --> 39:32.409
'cause you still sound
like a reverend to me.

39:32.410 --> 39:34.390
Well, just because I took off the collar

39:34.400 --> 39:35.740
doesn't mean my beliefs have changed.

39:35.750 --> 39:37.369
I'm just starting a new journey.

39:37.370 --> 39:39.369
Kind of like you and the God Account.

39:39.370 --> 39:41.659
- How so?
- Well, it seems that you've

39:41.660 --> 39:42.819
come back to square one

39:42.820 --> 39:44.920
in figuring out who's behind it.

39:44.940 --> 39:46.419
Are you okay with that?

39:46.420 --> 39:49.299
That you may never know?

39:52.820 --> 39:55.089
Actually, I am.

39:55.090 --> 39:57.640
What I've learned is that question

39:57.660 --> 39:59.280
isn't the most important thing.

40:00.100 --> 40:02.539
Helping people, changing lives,

40:02.540 --> 40:04.680
making a difference,

40:04.700 --> 40:06.940
that's what matters most.

40:07.020 --> 40:08.719
Well, look at that.

40:11.060 --> 40:12.339
We finally agree.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.279
You sure you don't want us to
come to the airport with you?

40:22.280 --> 40:23.930
Uh, yeah, I should probably

40:23.940 --> 40:25.359
get my goodbyes out of the way here,

40:25.360 --> 40:28.779
so I'm not that sad girl
crying in the security line.

40:28.780 --> 40:30.669
Mm-mm. Nobody wants that.

40:31.880 --> 40:33.169
I'm gonna miss you, Bloom.

40:33.170 --> 40:35.420
Gonna miss you too.

40:39.930 --> 40:42.690
All right, I'll give you guys a minute.

40:44.330 --> 40:48.419
Well, I guess this is it.

40:48.420 --> 40:50.879
You know, I wouldn't be going
to go live out my dream

40:50.880 --> 40:52.299
if it wasn't for you.

40:52.300 --> 40:54.940
And I wouldn't have been
able to do any of this

40:54.980 --> 40:56.340
if it wasn't for you.

40:58.740 --> 41:03.190
For the past 17 years, I've been lost.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.560
And then you come into my life,

41:05.570 --> 41:07.120
and you change everything.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.169
Cara, what I'm trying to say is...

41:11.170 --> 41:13.249
Stop.

41:13.250 --> 41:15.290
Please, don't say it.

41:16.310 --> 41:18.559
Because if you say it,
then I'm gonna say it,

41:18.560 --> 41:20.629
and I won't be able
to get on that plane.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.740
I will see you in six months.

41:35.400 --> 41:36.960
I'll see you then.

41:38.140 --> 41:39.279
Okay.

42:00.670 --> 42:03.169
How come you didn't tell her?

42:06.100 --> 42:07.920
Because she already knows.

42:09.840 --> 42:12.919
My man.

42:12.920 --> 42:14.439
All right, I gotta go.

42:14.440 --> 42:15.860
I'm checking out this new apartment.

42:15.880 --> 42:17.299
- You know, Jaya's moving back.
- Oh.

42:17.300 --> 42:19.619
Yeah. I figured might as well

42:19.620 --> 42:21.509
find a place of my own,

42:21.510 --> 42:23.790
and get out of your hair a little bit.

42:25.800 --> 42:28.360
- I'll see you later, man.
- See you, man.

42:31.170 --> 42:33.500
Miles Finer?

42:33.640 --> 42:34.879
That's right.

42:34.880 --> 42:37.100
It's not funny, okay?

42:38.350 --> 42:39.839
Okay.

42:39.840 --> 42:41.469
Don't act like you don't know who I am.

42:41.470 --> 42:44.129
I don't, so...

42:45.900 --> 42:49.299
Okay, uh, look,

42:49.300 --> 42:52.060
this is gonna sound crazy,

42:52.610 --> 42:54.539
but yesterday I got a friend request

42:54.540 --> 42:57.200
from someone calling
themselves God on Facebook,

42:58.010 --> 43:00.049
and they sent me your name.
