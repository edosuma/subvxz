[EMMA] I'VE BEEN HERE A WEEK.

03:00.970 --> 03:05.310
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASY BUT
I MET THIS GIRL, A WAITRESS.

03:05.350 --> 03:09.390
SHE SAID THE YOU TWO WERE PI'S
AND THAT JAKE WAS AWESOME.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.270
I MEAN PROFESSIONALLY, THAT
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP.

03:12.310 --> 03:13.980
[MALACHY] SO ALL
YOU HAVE IS A NICK NAME?

03:14.020 --> 03:16.320
[EMMA] YEAH, TURK.

03:16.360 --> 03:19.360
AND THIS PHOTO.

03:22.620 --> 03:25.580
MY MOM WAS 19 WORKING AS A
WAITRESS IN BANFF.

03:25.620 --> 03:28.830
TURK WAS PASSING THROUGH IN
A MOTOR BIKE WITH A BUDDY.

03:28.870 --> 03:31.830
VERY HANDSOME APPARENTLY.

03:31.870 --> 03:33.960
THEY HAD A WEEKEND FLING,
9 MONTHS LATER I SHOW UP.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.300
[JAKE] JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,
WHY ARE YOU CHOOSING NOW

03:36.340 --> 03:40.260
TO GO LOOKING FOR YOUR FATHER?
[EMMA] MY MOM JUST DIED.

03:40.300 --> 03:43.470
I JUST THOUGHT
NOW IS THE TIME, YOU KNOW?

03:43.510 --> 03:45.350
[MALACHY] SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

03:45.390 --> 03:47.350
[EMMA] JUST BEFORE THE END SHE
ADMITTED SHE HAD A FEW MORE

03:47.390 --> 03:51.190
DETAILS ABOUT TURK, HE RODE A
HARLEY AND WAS FROM ST JOHNS.

03:51.230 --> 03:56.610
[JAKE] AH, ANYTHING ELSE?
[EMMA] NO, UNFORTUNATELY.

03:56.650 --> 03:58.610
LOOK WHEN YOU FIND HIM,
CAN YOU LET HIM HIM KNOW

03:58.650 --> 04:02.660
I DON'T WANT ANY MONEY OR TO
INTRUDE IN HIS LIFE.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.280
I JUST WANT TO MEET HIM,
YOU KNOW.

04:05.320 --> 04:07.330
JUST ONCE.

04:11.790 --> 04:13.830
[JAKE] SEE, THAT'S WHAT
WORKING WITH YOU EVERYDAY
WILL DO TO A MAN.

04:13.880 --> 04:16.290
[ROSE] OKAY, THERE HE IS. THAT'S
WHAT HE WOULD LOOK LIKE TODAY.

04:16.340 --> 04:20.010
[MALACHY] NO REAL NAME, 25 YEAR
OLD PHOTO AND HE RODE A HARLEY.

04:20.050 --> 04:22.470
[ROSE] I WENT THROUGH
EVERY YEAR BOOK FROM
ST. JOHNS FROM THE 80'S,

04:22.510 --> 04:24.590
AND THERE WERE GUYS WITH
NICK NAMES LIKE "BUCKY",

04:24.640 --> 04:26.600
"FROG", "JIGGER"
BUT NO "TURKS".

04:26.640 --> 04:31.640
[MALACHY] BUT, ONCE A HARLEY
RIDER, ALWAYS A HARLEY RIDER.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.190
[JAKE] DO YOU KNOW HIM OR WHAT?

04:33.230 --> 04:34.520
[GRAHAM] NOT IF HE'S IN TROUBLE.

04:34.560 --> 04:36.900
[JAKE] HE'S NOT IN TROUBLE,
ALRIGHT. RELAX, IT'S JUST LIKE

04:36.940 --> 04:39.900

05:06.340 --> 05:09.510
HE SPONSORS ALL THE RIDES FOR
THE ROCK CHARITY STUFF.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.520

05:12.560 --> 05:15.400

08:10.610 --> 08:13.450
GUY IN THE PHOTO.
[EMMA] I SEE.

08:13.490 --> 08:15.660
[JAKE] THERE IS ALWAYS THE
POSSIBILITY THAT YOUR MOTHER

WASN'T EXACTLY TELLING YOU
EVERYTHING. EITHER WAY, HERE

08:22.080 --> 08:24.170

[EMMA] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

08:26.540 --> 08:27.550

THE RIGHT THING.

[EMMA] I ALMOST FORGOT...

08:39.100 --> 08:42.100

08:45.940 --> 08:47.730
[JAKE] YES, I GUESS I AM.

08:47.770 --> 08:49.730
BUT DON'T TELL HIM THAT, OKAY?

08:49.780 --> 08:52.610

08:52.650 --> 08:53.360
WATERMELON.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.200

09:11.800 --> 09:13.670
DID YOU LOCK THE DOOR?

09:13.720 --> 09:14.630
DID YOU TURN OFF THE LIGHT?

09:14.680 --> 09:15.640
[JAKE] YES, YES.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.350
[NIKKI] I THINK
THE LIGHT IS STILL ON.

09:17.390 --> 09:21.600
[JAKE] NO, I TURNED
OFF THE LIGHT.

09:21.640 --> 09:24.440
[NIKKI] I JUST-- I JUST
REALLY HATE HOW YOU LEAVE

09:25.980 --> 09:27.230
[NIKKI] NOTHING.

09:27.270 --> 09:28.730
[JAKE] DO YOU WANT
ME TO GO TURN OFF THE LIGHT?

09:28.770 --> 09:32.820
[NIKKI] NO... YES.
IT'S NOT THAT, I JUST...

09:32.860 --> 09:34.150
[JAKE] WHAT?

09:34.200 --> 09:35.360
[NIKKI] I WANNA
FIGURE OUT THINGS.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.700
[JAKE] OH MY GOD.

09:36.740 --> 09:37.820
[NIKKI] I NEED TO FIGURE THIS
OUT NOW.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.580

09:42.200 --> 09:44.080
[NIKKI] NO.
[JAKE] WHAT'S WITH YOU AND

09:44.120 --> 09:45.710
THESE FRIGGING PILLOWS?
[NIKKI] THEY'RE MINE.

09:45.750 --> 09:48.130
THEY'RE MY PILLOWS.

09:48.170 --> 09:50.710
DID YOU HEAR ME, I SAID THAT
I WANNA FIGURE THIS OUT.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.210
I JUST BEEN THINKING.

09:52.250 --> 09:53.210
[JAKE] THINKING?

09:53.250 --> 09:54.760
[NIKKI] YES.
[JAKE] ABOUT WHAT?

09:54.800 --> 09:56.050

09:59.430 --> 10:00.640
[NIKKI] YEAH.

10:02.350 --> 10:04.180
WE CAN'T KEEP HAVING
SEX LIKE THIS IN THE
MIDDLE OF OUR DIVORCE.

10:04.230 --> 10:05.690
[JAKE] NIKKI, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO STARTED THIS.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.190
[NIKKI] I KNOW, I REALIZE THAT.
I REALIZE, BUT I ALSO REALIZE

10:08.230 --> 10:10.980
THAT YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE
AND I CAN'T CHANGE YOU, OKAY?

10:11.020 --> 10:12.820
[JAKE] YEAH WELL I TOLD YOU
THAT THE FIRST DAY WE MET,

10:12.860 --> 10:15.780
JUST TOOK A DIVORCE
AND TWO FRIGGIN' LAWYERS
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

10:15.820 --> 10:17.450
[NIKKI] FORGET ABOUT THE
DIVORCE. I JUST THINK

10:17.490 --> 10:19.410
THAT YOU AND I CAN WORK
THROUGH THIS LIKE MATURE ADULTS.

10:19.450 --> 10:21.830
I THINK THAT WE CAN,
I'M NOT BE DIFFICULT.

10:21.870 --> 10:26.870
[JAKE] OH REALLY? YEAH.
[NIKKI] SKID DADDLE.

10:26.910 --> 10:28.000
[JAKE] SKID DADDLE?

10:28.040 --> 10:29.830
[NIKKI] I'LL GET YOU A BAG
FOR YOUR THINGS.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.630
[JAKE] YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?

10:39.890 --> 10:41.850
[NIKKI] LAST ONE, I SWEAR.

10:41.890 --> 10:44.640
&lt;♪♪&gt;

10:50.690 --> 10:52.230
[MALACHY] CRAP, I THOUGHT
YOU'D MOVED OUT.

10:52.270 --> 10:53.480
[JAKE] HA, HA.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.230
NOT MUCH CHANCE OF THAT,
NOT ANYTIME SOON ANYWAY.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.780
[MALACHY] A MAN CAN DREAM.
[TINNY] IT'S A BIT PATHETIC,

10:57.820 --> 11:00.200
ISN'T IT? GROWN MAN LIVING
WITH HIS DADDY?

11:00.240 --> 11:02.780
[ROSE] EMMA MICHAELTREE'S
CHEQUE BOUNCED.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.330
[JAKE] WHAT?
[ROSE] AND SHE'S NOT EMMA

11:04.370 --> 11:06.120
MICHAELTREE, THE REAL EMMA
MICHAELTREE HAD HER PURSE

11:06.160 --> 11:10.250
SNATCHED FROM THE LIBRARY
IN RICHMOND NINE DAYS AGO.

11:10.290 --> 11:15.130
[JAKE] WELL, SEE THEY KNEW SHE
WAS TROUBLE.

11:15.170 --> 11:15.880
[JAKE] HI--
[OPERATOR] SORRY,

11:15.920 --> 11:17.920
THIS MAIL BOX IS FULL. GOODBYE.

11:17.970 --> 11:19.930
[JAKE] HER MAIL BOX IS FULL.
[ROSE] I CAN HACK INTO IT,

11:19.970 --> 11:22.050
GIMME THE PHONE.
[JAKE] CAN YOU NOW?

11:22.090 --> 11:23.550
[ROSE] HOLD ON A SEC HERE.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.680
I JUST NEED TO MAKE
A LITTLE VOIP CALL

11:25.720 --> 11:30.600
AND FOOL THE CALLER ID
INTO THINKING HER CELL PHONE
IS CALLING ITSELF.

11:30.640 --> 11:33.860
THIS PROGRAM USES ALL THE CELL
PHONE COMPANY DEFAULTS.

11:33.900 --> 11:35.570
[MALACHY] HOPE YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN CHECKING MY MESSAGES.

11:35.610 --> 11:39.070
[ROSE/JAKE] NOBODY CALLS YOU.

11:39.110 --> 11:40.070
[ROSE] OKAY, HERE WE GO GUYS.

11:40.110 --> 11:41.610
[SALLY] EMMA
MICHAELTREE? THIS IS THE

11:41.660 --> 11:45.160
TRAVELERS INN. THERE'S A
PROBLEM WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.500
[UNIDENTIFIED MAN] HEY,
IT'S ME CALL ME.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.870
[SALLY] THIS IS THE
TRAVELERS INN--

11:48.910 --> 11:50.500
[JAKE] I'M GONNA GO OUT
ON A LIMB HERE,

11:50.540 --> 11:52.960
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD GO TO
THE TRAVELERS INN.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.710
[MALACHY] FIRST WE SHOULD
PAY OLD VICTOR A VISIT,

11:54.750 --> 11:56.300
SEE IF SHE'S POP UP THERE?

11:56.340 --> 11:58.510
[JAKE] ALRIGHT, I'M GONNA
GO GRAB A SHOWER FIRST.

11:58.550 --> 12:00.550
[MALACHY] YOU TOOK A
SHOWER LAST MONTH.

12:05.760 --> 12:06.850
[MALACHY] LET ME HANDLE
THIS, ALRIGHT.

12:06.890 --> 12:08.520
[JAKE] I HATE IT
WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU KNOW.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.100
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO KNOCK ON THE--

12:10.140 --> 12:11.770
[MALACHY] SHUT UP.

12:12.350 --> 12:13.940
[JAKE] I'M A GROWN
MAN, ALL RIGHT.

12:13.980 --> 12:16.650
YOU CAN'T TREAT ME LIKE
A 7 YEAR OLD BOY.

12:16.690 --> 12:18.230
[VICTOR] GENTLEMAN,
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

12:18.280 --> 12:19.900
[MALACHY] MR. BEERMAN WE JUST--
[JAKE] WE'RE REALLY REALLY

12:19.940 --> 12:22.740
SORRY ABOUT THE WAY THINGS
WENT DOWN THE LAST TIME, YOU

12:22.780 --> 12:25.370
KNOW, TURNS OUT THE GIRL EMMA
MICHAELTREE, SHE'S NOT EVEN

12:25.410 --> 12:28.080
REALLY EMMA MICHAELTREE.
[VICTOR] WELL, I TOLD YOU SHE

12:28.120 --> 12:29.870
WAS FULL OF IT, DIDN'T I?
[JAKE] YOU CERTAINLY DID. YOU

12:29.910 --> 12:32.120
KNOW, SHE HIRES US TO FIND
YOU, SO WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED

12:32.160 --> 12:35.330
TO DO? THEN SHE PAYS US WITH A
BUMPED CHEQUE AND FAKE ID AND

12:35.380 --> 12:37.920
THEN SHE JUST SORT OF
DISAPPEARED.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.170
[VICTOR] AND WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE ME DO?

12:39.210 --> 12:40.920
I TOLD YOU, I DON'T KNOW THE
GIRL.

12:40.970 --> 12:43.880
[MALACHY] WE WERE HOPING--
DID SHE MAKE CONTACT WITH YOU?

12:43.930 --> 12:46.850
[VICTOR] GENTLEMEN, I DON'T
KNOW WHO THE GIRL IS. SHE

12:46.890 --> 12:50.430
NEVER CAME, SHE NEVER CALLED,
SO IF YOU'LL PLEASE JUST GET

12:50.470 --> 12:59.440
OFF MY PROPERTY.
[JAKE] RIGHT.

12:59.480 --> 13:01.320
IN RETROSPECT I PROBABLY
SHOULD HAVE LET YOU HANDLE IT.

13:01.360 --> 13:05.160
[VICTOR] GUYS, WAIT.

13:05.200 --> 13:08.910
SORRY, YOU'RE PRIVATE
DETECTIVES, RIGHT?

13:08.950 --> 13:11.290
[JAKE] YES WE ARE.
[VICTOR] OKAY, WHAT IF I HIRED

13:11.330 --> 13:14.920
YOU TO TELL ME WHO SHE IS?
[JAKE] NOW, WHY WOULD YOU DO

13:14.960 --> 13:16.670
THAT?
[VICTOR] I'VE BEEN THINKING

13:16.710 --> 13:18.920
ABOUT IT, GIRL IS TRYING TO
FIND ME AND I WANNA TALK TO

13:18.960 --> 13:22.970
HER. FIND OUT WHY.
[JAKE] WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING

13:23.010 --> 13:25.050
FOR HER ANYWAY, GUESS WE MIGHT
AS WELL GET PAID FOR IT. NO?

13:25.090 --> 13:27.850
YEAH, WE CAN DO THAT.
[VICTOR] GREAT, BUT WE KEEP IT

13:27.890 --> 13:29.850
CONFIDENTIAL. I DON'T NEED
CHARLOTTE FINDING OUT ABOUT

13:29.890 --> 13:32.730
ANY OF THIS. BUT I'LL PAY YOU
DOUBLE WHAT THAT GIRL OWES

13:32.770 --> 13:37.560
YOU. DEAL?
[JAKE] DEAL.

13:37.610 --> 13:41.030
[VICTOR] ALRIGHT, SO YOU FIGURE
OUT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT,

13:41.070 --> 13:43.240
YOU GIVE ME A CALL. YES?

13:43.280 --> 13:46.200
[JAKE] ABSOLUTELY.
WE'LL CALL YOU.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.740
[MALACHY] WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?
[JAKE] I DON'T KNOW.

13:47.780 --> 13:49.410
DO YOU THINK ANYONE IS TELLING
THE TRUTH AROUND HERE?

13:49.450 --> 13:52.450
[MALACHY] JUST ME, AND LOOK
WHO I ENDED UP WITH.

13:53.870 --> 13:55.120
[SALLY] SHE SEEMED LIKE
A NICE GIRL.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.420
[JAKE] YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
THEY USUALLY SAY ABOUT
SERIAL KILLERS.

13:57.460 --> 13:58.790
[SALLY] ANY IDEA WHERE SHE WENT?

13:58.830 --> 14:00.960
[MALACHY] NO, NOT REALLY.
[SALLY] USUALLY WHEN THEY SKIPS

14:01.000 --> 14:04.010
OUT, THEY DON'T TEND TO LEAVE
THEIR STUFF.

14:04.050 --> 14:06.930
IF YOU GUYS FIND HER,
LET ME KNOW. I'LL PAY YOU FOR

14:06.970 --> 14:10.050
YOUR TIME. I JUST HATES IT
WHEN THEY SKIPS OUT LIKE THIS.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.720
[MALACHY] SO DO WE.

14:13.180 --> 14:17.520
[JAKE] THIS IS EMMA
MICHAELTREE'S.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.480
I FOUND HER CHEQUE BOOK.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.860
WHO KNOWS WHO OWNS THE REST
OF THIS CRAP.

14:21.900 --> 14:24.900
[MALACHY] WELL, WELL.
[JAKE] WHAT DO YOU GOT?

14:24.940 --> 14:27.740
WHAT?

14:27.780 --> 14:29.410
AH, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:29.450 --> 14:31.830
THINK IT'LL BE A MATCH?

14:31.870 --> 14:33.080
IT'S A MATCH.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.660
[MALACHY] SO WHY DID
SHE GIVE US JUST ONE?

14:34.700 --> 14:36.120
[JAKE] MAYBE THIS HAS SOME
SENTIMENTAL VALUE.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.670
COULD BE HER MOTHER IN THE
PICTURE THERE.

14:38.710 --> 14:39.960
[MALACHY] OKAY THEN.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.340
WHY DID SHE LEAVE WITHOUT THEM?

14:42.380 --> 14:45.380
[JAKE] WHY DID SHE LEAVE
WITHOUT ANY OF THIS STUFF?

14:45.420 --> 14:47.130
[MALACHY] IF SHE WAS LEAVING
TOWN YOU THINK SHE'D HAVE

14:47.170 --> 14:49.180
PACKED HER PANTIES.
[JAKE] OH MY GOD! I HATE IT

14:49.220 --> 14:50.590
WHEN YOU SAY THAT WORD.

14:50.640 --> 14:51.510
[MALACHY] WHAT, "PANTIES"?

14:51.550 --> 14:53.060
DOCTORS SAY IT, IT'S CLINICAL.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.310
[MALACHY] IT'S NOT CLINICAL
WHEN YOU SAY IT.

14:54.350 --> 14:55.720
IT'S DISGUSTING, ALRIGHT?

14:55.770 --> 14:59.560
[MALACHY] PANTIES.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.150
THAT GUY IS WATCHING US.

15:02.190 --> 15:03.480
[JAKE] WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW.

15:03.520 --> 15:11.320
WHY DON'T WE GO SAY HELLO TO
HIM, EH?

15:11.370 --> 15:13.160
WEIRD, NO?

15:13.200 --> 15:15.120
OH, UNBELIEVABLE!

[MALACHY] I LIKE YOUR WORK BY
THE WAY. ITS VERY TASTEFUL.

15:42.980 --> 15:43.940
[JAKE] DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM.

15:43.980 --> 15:46.150
[MALACHY] I GOTTA
SUPPORT THE ARTS.

15:46.190 --> 15:47.190
[JAKE] IT IS NOT ART!

15:47.230 --> 15:49.990
[DES] IT IS ART MAN.

15:50.030 --> 15:50.990

15:54.950 --> 15:57.160
[MALACHY] WE DON'T KNOW IF
SHE MADE CONTACT WITH VICTOR.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.410
[JAKE] IT'S POSSIBLE
HE'S LYING TO US, YOU KNOW.
YOU EVER THINK OF THAT?

15:59.460 --> 16:02.540
[MALACHY] SURE LOOKS LIKE EMMA
LEFT TOWN IN A HURRY.
[JAKE] IF SHE LEFT TOWN.

16:02.580 --> 16:06.210
I MEAN, IS SHE LYING TO US,
OR IS SHE TRYING TO SCAM HIM?

16:06.250 --> 16:09.170
IT'S HARD TO TELL.
[MALACHY] EITHER WAY,
IT'S TANGLY.

16:09.210 --> 16:11.010
[DES] HEY, HEY
THIS IS GONNA TAKE FOREVER MAN.

16:11.050 --> 16:12.430

19:46.260 --> 19:47.520
[BILL] WAS LOOKING FOR MY
GIRLFRIEND.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.560
[JAKE] OH YEAH, WHO THE HELL
IS THAT?

19:51.600 --> 19:52.770
[BILL] LISA.

19:52.810 --> 19:55.980
[JAKE] LISA? BUDDY,
I KNOW A TON OF LISA'S, ALRIGHT.

19:56.020 --> 19:58.030
[BILL] YOU KNOW HER AS "EMMA".

19:59.490 --> 20:00.400
[JAKE] RIGHT.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.950
[BILL] HER NAME IS LISA KNIGHT.

20:01.990 --> 20:03.990
SHE CAME OUT HERE
LOOKING FOR HER DAD.

20:04.030 --> 20:07.660
SHE TOLD ME SHE HIRED YOU,
AND THEN THAT WAS IT.

20:07.700 --> 20:12.000
SHE STOPED ANSWERING CALLS
SO... I FLEW OUT HERE FROM BC.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.130
[JAKE] AND YOU ARE?

20:13.170 --> 20:15.420

[JAKE] OKAY, JUST BILL.

20:20.800 --> 20:23.390
IS YOUR GIRLFRIEND LISA KNIGHT,
IS SHE IN THE HABIT OF STEALING

20:23.430 --> 20:25.100
OTHER PEOPLE'S IDENTIFICATION?

20:25.140 --> 20:29.020
[BILL] NO MAN,
SHE WANTED TO COME OUT HERE
AND LOOK FOR HER DAD.

20:29.060 --> 20:31.730
BUT THEN SHE LOST HER
JOB. THINGS AIN'T BEEN REAL

20:31.770 --> 20:34.230
GOOD FOR HER LATELY,
SHE'S A MESS.

20:34.270 --> 20:37.190
[JAKE] YEAH, I GUESS YOU COULD
SAY THAT.

20:37.230 --> 20:38.030
WHERE IS SHE?

20:38.070 --> 20:39.320
[BILL] I DON'T KNOW.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.320
THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING
YOU AROUND.

20:41.360 --> 20:47.330
I'M THINKING THIS IS A SMALL
CITY AND I'M GONNA HAVE NO
PROBLEM, PIECE OF CAKE RIGHT?

20:47.370 --> 20:50.290
I'M GETTING NOWHERE.
CAN YOU HELP ME?

20:50.330 --> 20:52.460
I GOT SOME CASH,
I COULD PAY YOU.

20:52.500 --> 20:56.000
[JAKE] NO WAY PALLY. I GOT
BETTER THINGS TO DO THEN TO BE

20:56.040 --> 20:58.590
CHASING SOME CRAZY IDENTITY
STEALING CHICK, ALRIGHT.

20:58.630 --> 20:59.590
[BILL] WILL THIS DO?

20:59.630 --> 21:01.550
IT'S TEN BROWN ONES MAN.

21:01.590 --> 21:03.590

21:03.630 --> 21:07.850

21:07.890 --> 21:10.060

21:10.100 --> 21:12.480
BUT I GOTTA WARN YOU,
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS

21:12.520 --> 21:15.560
GIRL, I HAVEN'T HAD ANY LUCK.

21:15.600 --> 21:19.070
[BILL] SHE TOLD ME SHE TALKED
TO HIM, HER FATHER.

21:19.110 --> 21:21.650
[JAKE] VICTOR BEERMAN?
[BILL] YEAH. SHE SAID THAT HE

21:21.690 --> 21:25.820
TOLD HER WHERE THEY SHOULD
MEET, AND THEN THAT WAS IT.

21:25.860 --> 21:29.030
THAT WAS THE LAST I HEARD FROM
HER.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.450
[JAKE] ALRIGHT, I'LL SEE WHAT
I CAN DO.

21:30.490 --> 21:33.500
DON'T-- JUST--

21:33.540 --> 21:36.290
&lt;♪♪&gt;

21:41.510 --> 21:44.380

21:44.420 --> 21:47.510
[DES] WHATEVER.
I'M AFRAID OF NOTHING.

21:47.550 --> 21:48.300
[TINNY] YEAH?

21:48.350 --> 21:52.520
[DES] YEAH, I'M A

21:58.060 --> 22:00.110
WANNA TAKE A PICTURE?

22:00.150 --> 22:06.200
[DES] NO, JUST ADMIRING YOUR
BEAUTY. I MEAN YOU'RE PRETTY.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.610

22:09.370 --> 22:10.370
[JAKE] WHAT IS THIS?

22:10.410 --> 22:12.790
[DES] NOTHING.
[TINNY] MIND YOUR BUSINESS.

22:15.870 --> 22:17.500
[JAKE] GO ON.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.460
SHE'S MY PRIDE AND JOY,

22:21.500 --> 22:23.000
[DES] DON'T HIT ME,
DON'T HIT ME.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.420
DON'T HIT ME.

22:24.460 --> 22:25.970
[JAKE] NOW LISTEN TO ME.

22:26.010 --> 22:30.100
I'M NOT GONNA HIT YOU.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.430
I'M GONNA RELEASE YOU INTO
THE WILD.

22:32.470 --> 22:35.390
IT'S THE SECOND TIME THAT I'VE
LET YOU OUT OF HANDCUFFS.

22:35.430 --> 22:37.390
I DON'T WANNA SEE YOU HERE
AGAIN.

22:37.440 --> 22:44.440
[DES] WHAT ABOUT THE CAR?
[JAKE] JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

22:44.480 --> 22:45.530
[DES] I'M SORRY MAN.

22:45.570 --> 22:47.030
SERIOUSLY, I AM.

22:47.070 --> 22:48.570
[JAKE] JUST GO BACK TO YOUR
CAVE OR, WHEREVER IT IS YOU

22:48.610 --> 22:51.450

I CHANGE MY MIND.

22:51.490 --> 22:53.330
GO! GO! GO!

22:53.370 --> 22:59.620
[MALACHY] BYE DES.

22:59.670 --> 23:02.340
[JAKE] HERE IS TO LITTLE EMMA,
OR HER REAL NAME BEING

23:02.380 --> 23:03.420

23:03.460 --> 23:05.590
[MALACHY] AND HER BOYFRIEND
WOULDN'T GIVE YOU HIS LAST NAME?

23:05.630 --> 23:08.050
[JAKE] NO, JUST BILL.

23:08.090 --> 23:10.640
[MALACHY] HE'S LYING TOO.
[JAKE] WELL, EITHER WAY HE

23:10.680 --> 23:13.470
PAID CASH AND CASH IS YOU

23:13.510 --> 23:17.520
[MALACHY] THIS IS A RECORD,
THREE CLIENTS FOR ONE CASE.

23:17.560 --> 23:20.520

DISAPPEARS, THE OTHER CLIENT,

23:20.560 --> 23:21.610

23:21.650 --> 23:23.270
[MALACHY] AND THE OTHER ONE WE

23:23.320 --> 23:26.610
[JAKE] CHEERS TO THAT SKIPPER.

23:26.650 --> 23:29.490
[WALTER] VICTOR BEERMAN CAME TO
ST JOHNS ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO,

23:29.530 --> 23:32.490
FROM THE USA. HUGE PILE OF
CASH, HE STARTED BUYING OUT

23:32.530 --> 23:34.620

NOBODY WANTED IT.

23:34.660 --> 23:38.330
[JAKE] OH YEAH,
SINCE WHEN DID PEOPLE START
WANTING MOUNT PEARL?

23:38.370 --> 23:41.330

REPUTATION LIKE?

23:42.750 --> 23:44.750
[WALTER] TOUGH NEGOTIATOR.

23:46.590 --> 23:48.380

23:48.420 --> 23:52.640
[JAKE] BUT NOTHING CRIMINAL?
[WALTER] WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

23:52.680 --> 23:54.010

23:54.050 --> 23:55.430
BUT DO ME A FAVOUR,
KEEP DIGGING ALRIGHT?

23:55.470 --> 23:57.640
[WALTER] YEAH, I CAN

23:57.680 --> 23:59.060
BUT WE GOTTA TALK ABOUT NIKKI.

23:59.100 --> 24:00.600
[JAKE] WHAT?

24:00.640 --> 24:02.690

BOND JAKE, AND I GUESS THE

24:05.520 --> 24:08.360
GOOD NEWS IS IT'S GONNA KEEP
YOU AWAY FROM HER. IS IT?

24:08.400 --> 24:10.110
[JAKE] ABSOLUTELY.
[WALTER] I'M SERIOUS MAN,

24:10.150 --> 24:12.910
JUST DON'T GET SUCKED INTO THE
VORTEX OF SIN HERE.

24:12.950 --> 24:16.490
[JAKE] VORTEX OF INSANITY.
[WALTER] JUST STAY AWAY.

24:16.530 --> 24:17.330
[JAKE] TOTALLY, I WILL.

24:17.370 --> 24:19.910
I AM, YOU KNOW
IT'S JUST KIND OF...

24:19.960 --> 24:21.670
[WALTER] WHO'S THAT?

24:21.710 --> 24:24.250
[JAKE] IT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

24:24.290 --> 24:25.250
[WALTER] YOU'RE AT IT AGAIN.

24:25.290 --> 24:26.670
[JAKE] NO WE'RE NOT--

24:26.710 --> 24:28.050
[WALTER] YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:28.090 --> 24:30.510
JUST STAY AWAY FROM YOUR WIFE.
OR YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST DON'T.

24:30.550 --> 24:33.470
DON'T BOTHER, JUST MAKE UP
YOUR MIND ALREADY.

24:33.510 --> 24:36.260
OKAY, I GOT A HEARING IN LIKE
8 MINUTES AGO.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.680
[JAKE] NO ONE IS STOPPING
YOU FROM GOING.

24:37.720 --> 24:39.310
[WALTER] KEEP IT IN YOUR PANTS.

24:41.270 --> 24:43.480
[JAKE] SO ACCORDING TO WALTER,
BEERMAN HAS BEEN LIQUIDATING

24:43.520 --> 24:45.810
A LOAD OF ASSETS AND HE'S CASHED
IN A BUNCH OF RRSP'S TOO.

24:45.860 --> 24:47.400
[MALACHY] IS HE ABOUT TO RUN?

24:47.440 --> 24:49.440
OR IS HE PAYING SOMEONE OFF?
[ROSE] WELL, I'VE GOT SOMETHING

24:49.480 --> 24:52.030

IN A SUPER MAX, IN CONCORD

24:52.070 --> 24:54.320
NEW HAMPSHIRE DOING A LIFE
SENTENCE. GOT THE SAME BIRTHDAY

24:54.360 --> 24:55.490

24:55.530 --> 24:56.700
[MALACHY] HE STEALS
THE REAL GUYS IDENTITY,

24:56.740 --> 24:58.990
KNOWING HE'D NEVER
SHOW UP TO ASK FOR IT BACK.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.620
[JAKE] SO IF HE'S NOT THE REAL
VICTOR BEERMAN,

25:00.660 --> 25:02.080
THEN WHO THE HELL IS HE?

25:02.120 --> 25:04.290

[JAKE] OH, YOU ARE LUCKY.

25:43.660 --> 25:45.580
[JAKE] CONSTABLE, NICE TO HEAR

25:45.620 --> 25:48.840
[LESLIE] I THINK MAYBE WE
FOUND YOUR MISSING CLIENT.

25:48.880 --> 25:52.420

[DES] OW! OW!

25:59.350 --> 26:00.800

26:10.150 --> 26:15.200
[JAKE] SUIT YOURSELF.
[DES] HE'S STUBBORN,

26:24.830 --> 26:28.500
BEFORE JAKE GETS BACK AND STAY
AWAY FROM THE YOUNG TINNY.

26:28.540 --> 26:34.050
OTHERWISE IT WON'T BE JAKE
YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT.

26:34.090 --> 26:36.220
WHAT DO YOU HAVE STOCKHOLM
SYNDROME?

26:36.260 --> 26:39.260
[DES] CAN YOU TEACH ME HOW TO

26:40.260 --> 26:43.260
&lt;♪♪&gt;

26:54.650 --> 26:55.820
[JAKE] WHAT HAPPENED?

26:55.860 --> 26:58.610

[JILL] SOMETHING CHOPPED SO
HARD ACROSS THE POSTERIOR NECK,

27:11.420 --> 27:13.710
IT CRUSHED THE SPINE
BETWEEN C2 AND C3.

27:13.750 --> 27:15.000
[LESLIE] RIGHT.

27:15.050 --> 27:16.760
[JILL] IT WOULD HAVE STOPPED

27:16.800 --> 27:18.880

OKAY AND THEN THIS OTHER GUY
BILL, HE SHOWS UP RIGHT,

28:05.350 --> 28:07.890
BUT HE WON'T TELL US HIS

28:07.930 --> 28:08.980
HE CLAIMS TO BE HER BOYFRIEND.

28:09.020 --> 28:13.020
[LESLIE] AND WHERE IS HE TO?

28:13.060 --> 28:15.060
[LESLIE] YOU'RE A GREAT HELP
DOYLE.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.730
REMEMBER, DON'T GO ANYWHERE

28:18.940 --> 28:21.280
[JAKE] WITHOUT YOU, I WOULDN'T
DREAM OF IT CONSTABLE.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.700
[MALACHY] THANKS OFFICER.

28:22.740 --> 28:27.620
[JAKE] DAD, SO APPARENTLY WE'RE

28:34.460 --> 28:36.750
THE ONE WITH THE MOST TO
LOOSE.

28:36.790 --> 28:38.800
[MALACHY] EXCEPT LISA KNIGHT.

28:43.970 --> 28:47.720
[JAKE] MR. BEERMAN,

[VICTOR] I TOLD YOU,
SHE DIDN'T COME HERE.

29:00.690 --> 29:03.610
[MALACHY] POLICE WILL CHECK

29:03.660 --> 29:05.160

[MALACHY] SHE WASN'T YOUR
GIRLFRIEND, WAS SHE BILL?

32:20.100 --> 32:22.810

35:28.120 --> 35:29.790
[VICTOR] I DON'T KNOW!
I WENT AND SAW HER,
I GAVE HER THE MONEY,

35:29.830 --> 35:32.340
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO PUT THE
EVIDENCE IN A SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX

35:32.380 --> 35:35.590
BUT SHE DISAPPEARED. RIGHT?
THAT'S WHY I HIRED YOU GUYS.

35:35.630 --> 35:37.340

[CHARLOTTE] YOU'RE LYING!

35:49.690 --> 35:50.770

[JAKE] WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

36:01.570 --> 36:10.160
[LESLIE] THE MURDER WEAPON.
[VICTOR] I'M SORRY.

36:10.210 --> 36:11.790
I'M SORRY.

36:11.830 --> 36:13.830
I DIDN'T KILL HER.

36:15.800 --> 36:18.800
[LESLIE] VICTOR BEERMAN,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

36:21.300 --> 36:23.300
[VICTOR] I DIDN'T KILL HER.

36:28.810 --> 36:30.390
[VICTOR] I DIDN'T KILL
THAT GIRL.

36:30.430 --> 36:33.980
[LESLIE] MAYBE NOT, BUT WE
DO KNOW THAT 25 YEARS AGO,

36:34.020 --> 36:38.030
YOU AND BILL GOSKY
ROBBED A FAMILY AND
KILLED THEIR DAUGHTER.

36:43.070 --> 36:46.080
[JAKE] KEITH, YOU GOT SOMETHING
YOU WANNA SAY THERE, BUDDY?

36:49.750 --> 36:52.750
[MALACHY] YOU WANNA TELL US
HOW THE MONEY GOT IN THE GARAGE?

36:55.250 --> 36:57.800
[KEITH] I JUST WANTED
TO MEET MY SISTER.

36:57.840 --> 37:01.800
SO I FOLLOWED MY DAD AFTER
HE DROPPED THE MONEY OFF

37:01.840 --> 37:04.430
AND THEN I FOLLOWED HER,

37:04.470 --> 37:08.430
BUT SHE SAID SHE
WASN'T MY SISTER

37:08.470 --> 37:12.310
AND THEN SHE SAID SAY
GOOD BYE TO YOUR DADDY

37:12.350 --> 37:17.440
BECAUSE AFTER SHE GOT THE MONEY,
SHE WAS GOING TO THE COPS,

37:17.480 --> 37:20.690
TO TELL THEM THAT YOU
KILLED THE GIRL.

37:20.740 --> 37:22.820
SHE HAD PHOTOS.

37:22.860 --> 37:25.320
SHE HAD PHOTOS OF YOU WITH
THE GIRL FROM THE ROBBERY.

37:25.360 --> 37:26.660
[VICTOR] KEITH.

37:26.700 --> 37:28.450
[KEITH] AND THEN SHE SAID
YOU WERE GOING TO JAIL.

37:28.490 --> 37:31.410
[VICTOR] STOP TALKING SON.
[KEITH] JUST LIKE HER FATHER.

37:31.450 --> 37:33.460
FOR 25 YEARS.
[JAKE] KEITH,

37:33.500 --> 37:36.290
LISTEN TO YOUR DAD, ALRIGHT.
JUST WAIT FOR LAWYER.

37:36.330 --> 37:41.050
[KEITH] SO THEN I ASKED HER,
FOR THE PICTURES.

37:41.090 --> 37:45.470
SHE DIDN'T GIVE THEM TO ME.
SO THEN I HIT HER.

37:45.510 --> 37:46.890
JUST ONCE BUT...

37:46.930 --> 37:51.930
[LESLIE] BUT WHAT?

38:37.940 --> 38:41.150
[LESLIE] NO, I MEAN

38:41.190 --> 38:44.400
