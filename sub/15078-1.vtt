41:13.672 --> 41:15.507
AND VERY PERCEPTIVE.

41:18.544 --> 41:21.513
I'M SORRY MY FRIEND
WAS SUCH A [BLEEP]

41:21.547 --> 41:25.116
I TOLD HER NOT TO FILE
THAT COMPLAINT.

41:25.150 --> 41:30.722
OH, OH, UH, UH,
COULD YOU --

41:30.756 --> 41:33.491
COULD YOU JUST WAIT --
UH, WAIT HERE ONE SECOND?

41:35.160 --> 41:36.294
LEWICKI!

41:36.327 --> 41:38.029
W-WHAT IS IT, DOC?

41:38.063 --> 41:41.332
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME IF
THERE'S SOMEONE IN MY OFFICE.

41:45.436 --> 41:47.573
Karyn: HEY!

41:53.478 --> 41:55.480
THAT ONE
WAS DEFINITELY REAL.

41:57.949 --> 42:01.419
Daniel: LAST WEEK, I ASKED,
"WHAT IS REALITY?"

42:01.452 --> 42:06.324
THIS WEEK,
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT NORMALCY.

42:06.357 --> 42:09.060
WHAT IS NORMAL?

42:09.094 --> 42:13.565
IF YOU FEEL SAD, DO YOU JUST
HAVE A CASE OF THE BLUES,

42:13.599 --> 42:17.535
OR ARE YOU SUFFERING
FROM A NEUROCHEMICAL IMBALANCE?

42:19.705 --> 42:22.674
THE VAST MAJORITY
OF THE CASE STUDIES

42:22.708 --> 42:24.309
THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT

42:24.342 --> 42:26.812
INVOLVE PATIENTS WHOSE BRAINS
ARE ANYTHING BUT NORMAL,

42:26.845 --> 42:29.014
AND THERE'S NO QUESTION
THEY SUFFER.

42:29.047 --> 42:32.851
BUT...

42:32.884 --> 42:34.853
IS IT ALL BAD?

42:34.886 --> 42:38.189
FOR SOME,
THEIR NEUROLOGICAL STATES

42:38.223 --> 42:40.058
MIGHT ACTUALLY PROTECT THEM

42:40.091 --> 42:43.962
FROM PAINFUL TRUTHS THAT NO ONE
WOULD WANT TO THINK ABOUT.

42:43.995 --> 42:47.465
OTHERS DEVELOP
A-A CHEERFUL DISPOSITION

42:47.498 --> 42:49.534
THAT MAY HELP THEM COPE
WITH SITUATIONS

42:49.567 --> 42:51.569
THE REST OF US
WOULD FIND DISTURBING.

42:54.505 --> 42:57.743
AND IF WE ARE TO ESTABLISH
A BASELINE,

42:57.776 --> 42:59.745
THEN WE ALSO
HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES

42:59.778 --> 43:02.313
HOW THE BRAINS OF EVEN
SO-CALLED NORMAL PEOPLE

43:02.347 --> 43:05.751
RESPOND TO CERTAIN STIMULI.

43:19.364 --> 43:21.933
AND IF WE'RE ABLE TO
TREAT THOSE PEOPLE

43:21.967 --> 43:24.369
LIVING WITH
NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS,

43:24.402 --> 43:28.874
RESTORE THEM TO --
QUOTE -- "NORMALCY,"

43:28.907 --> 43:31.877
WELL, OF COURSE
WE'RE HELPING THEM.

43:31.910 --> 43:36.014
BUT MIGHT WE SOMETIMES
ALSO BE STRIPPING AWAY

43:36.047 --> 43:38.283
WHAT MAKES THEM UNIQUE...

43:39.818 --> 43:44.455
...ROBBING THEM
OF AN ESSENTIAL PART

43:44.489 --> 43:47.192
OF WHO THEY ARE?
