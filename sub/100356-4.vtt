00:02.300 --> 00:02.633
- Previously on

00:02.633 --> 00:03.200
- Previously on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:04.533 --> 00:06.200
- I'm saving up
for your bachelor party.

00:06.233 --> 00:08.066
- All right!
- Miami.

00:08.100 --> 00:10.300
We're going all out. And he's
allowed to get strippers.

00:10.333 --> 00:11.633
- You heard it first right here.

00:11.667 --> 00:13.467
- I saw this idea
about a bachelorette party

00:13.500 --> 00:16.266
that all wore, like,
tacky wedding dresses.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.166
- I mean, people thought mine
was tacky.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.166
I could always just wear my own.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.567
- Max--I still think he should
prioritize me over Dayna.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.266
- Like, I'm here and he's here,

00:24.300 --> 00:25.633
and he's dating girls here.

00:25.667 --> 00:27.400
There's just something
that, like, irks me.

00:27.433 --> 00:29.333
- You're sure it doesn't
have to do with Max?

00:30.600 --> 00:33.133
- You say, "We're broken up,"

00:33.166 --> 00:35.567
but every single person
in your life knows

00:35.600 --> 00:39.100
that Carter still lives here.
When you move out of here,

00:39.133 --> 00:40.300
where is he gonna go?

00:42.367 --> 00:45.066
Praise the breakup gods.

00:45.100 --> 00:48.300
I just woke up to a text
from Tom Sandoval.

00:48.333 --> 00:51.133
Just listen. "I will literally
kick you the

00:51.166 --> 00:52.500
out of TomTom."

00:52.533 --> 00:54.100
I did nothing wrong.
- You did nothing wrong?

00:54.133 --> 00:55.400
- You didn't have to do
anything.

00:55.433 --> 00:57.400
- You never do anything.
- You had to do nothing!

00:57.433 --> 00:59.667
- Sandoval spitting blood.

00:59.700 --> 01:01.467
- I've got to get
to the bottom of it,

01:01.500 --> 01:03.400
'cause I'm not quite
understanding what's happened.

01:36.166 --> 01:38.266
- Hey!
- Hi!

01:38.300 --> 01:40.500
- We gotta finish packing
'cause we gotta go.

01:40.533 --> 01:43.300
You're so creepy.

01:43.333 --> 01:46.333
- I only brought
12 bathing suits,

01:46.367 --> 01:48.433
so I don't know
if that's enough.

01:50.667 --> 01:52.533
Oh, my God.
I just got so many new ones.

01:52.567 --> 01:55.266
I haven't tried any of them on.
My ass has gotten fatter,

01:55.300 --> 01:57.433
so let's hope that they fit.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.166
Right?

02:01.200 --> 02:02.667
- I know we have
someone housesitting,

02:02.700 --> 02:05.467
but I wanna make sure
it's filled so when we're gone,

02:05.500 --> 02:08.200
we can throw them the treats.

02:08.233 --> 02:10.333
- You guys want some treats?

02:12.333 --> 02:14.467
Get it.

02:14.500 --> 02:15.734
- Come on!

02:15.767 --> 02:17.133
- Okay, I'm coming.
I'm coming up.

02:17.166 --> 02:18.467
- Miami, baby.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.333
We're going to Miami!
It's finally time.

02:21.367 --> 02:23.266
It's my bachelorette party.

02:23.300 --> 02:25.333
I've been dreaming about this
for all my life.

02:25.367 --> 02:27.233
Just hoping everything
goes good.

02:27.266 --> 02:29.367
We're about to tear Miami up.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.400
Didn't you and Sandoval
live together in Miami

02:31.433 --> 02:33.333
a long time ago?
- Yeah, like,

02:33.367 --> 02:35.633
many, many, many, many,
many years ago.

02:35.667 --> 02:39.233
Sandoval had hair down to here.
- Oh, gosh. Ugh.

02:39.266 --> 02:42.433
I can't imagine him
with hair that long.

02:42.467 --> 02:45.367
- Oh, I didn't even tell you.
Kristen moved into her house...

02:45.400 --> 02:47.467
by herself.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.633
- Really?
- I mean, that's a huge step.

02:49.667 --> 02:51.767
- That's pretty great.
I mean, I feel like the fact

02:52.000 --> 02:54.200
that she'll have, like,
that space where maybe she'll,

02:54.233 --> 02:56.633
like, start seeing things
clearer.

02:56.667 --> 03:00.333
- Things are looking up for me
and Kristen's relationship.

03:00.367 --> 03:03.500
I feel like she's gonna be
on the path to finding herself.

03:03.533 --> 03:04.767
Does that mean that, like,
I don't have to

03:05.000 --> 03:07.166
see Carter again?
- Probably.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.367
- I hope so.

03:13.600 --> 03:16.233
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

03:16.266 --> 03:17.533
- How's it going?

03:17.567 --> 03:19.667
Welcome to my home.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.734
- I'm a ----ing homeowner.

03:21.767 --> 03:23.400
- Beautiful place.
- Thank you.

03:23.433 --> 03:25.000
- Really nice.

03:25.033 --> 03:28.400
- I'm single.
I have two awesome dogs.

03:28.433 --> 03:31.200
I kind of feel like
I'm just winning at life.

03:34.333 --> 03:36.266
- Hi.
- Hello!

03:36.300 --> 03:39.166
Oh, my gosh. It's real.

03:39.200 --> 03:42.266
Oh, my God.
It's gonna be so great.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.467
So here we go.
- Oh, sh--.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.767
Carter...Whoopsie.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.767
- Is he, like, coming over here?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.233
- I mean, at some point. Yeah.

03:52.266 --> 03:53.633
I mean,
I'm just saying in general,

03:53.667 --> 03:55.667
eventually, at some point,
of course he'll be here.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.266
- Is he moving in here?

03:57.300 --> 03:59.233
- He is not.
This is all my stuff.

03:59.266 --> 04:01.533
His stuff is still
at the apartment.

04:01.567 --> 04:03.633
- Are you gonna, like--
- We had sex this morning.

04:03.667 --> 04:06.700
- You had sex this morning?
Kristen.

04:06.734 --> 04:09.200
- It's fine.
- That never works.

04:09.233 --> 04:12.367
Kristen's kind of living
in two worlds right now--

04:12.400 --> 04:14.233
the one she's telling
all of her friends about,

04:14.266 --> 04:16.333
which is the "me and Carter
are completely broken up."

04:16.367 --> 04:19.734
But in reality,
her and Carter have sex,

04:19.767 --> 04:21.567
hang out all the time,

04:21.600 --> 04:25.200
and he's getting his stuff
shipped to her new house.

04:25.233 --> 04:26.600
You're so messy.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.567
- I know.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.300
- I hope Miami's not weird.

04:30.333 --> 04:33.333
Yesterday was
really ----ing intense.

04:33.367 --> 04:35.433
- How was the conversation
between Stassi and Sandoval?

04:35.467 --> 04:37.033
Like, did they--
- Well, she screamed like

04:37.066 --> 04:38.433
an out-of-tune Mariah Carey.

04:38.467 --> 04:40.734
Like, literally, like,
whistle tones.

04:40.767 --> 04:42.767
- I think the main thing I'm
most nervous about this trip--

04:43.000 --> 04:44.533
I haven't talked to Sandoval.

04:44.567 --> 04:46.367
- I haven't talked to him
either.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.233
- I was furious.

04:48.266 --> 04:51.033
- I still have no idea
what he was doing or thinking.

04:51.066 --> 04:52.667
- And I'm not ----ing
apologizing for that.

04:52.700 --> 04:54.300
- You shouldn't.
- It's my party.

04:54.333 --> 04:55.734
- Tom's texts were
really aggressive.

04:55.767 --> 04:57.400
- They were really aggressive.

04:57.433 --> 04:59.300
- "Kick you the
out of TomTom"?

04:59.333 --> 05:01.433
Like, who the
do you think you are, Sandoval?

05:01.467 --> 05:03.600
- The owner of TomTom.

05:07.367 --> 05:08.667
- I have a meeting with Lisa,

05:08.700 --> 05:10.433
so let's make sure
everything's perfect.

05:10.467 --> 05:11.467
Flowers, polish all
the glassware, please.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.467
Candles everywhere.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.367
I'm super anxious today.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.700
- Oh, sh--

05:17.734 --> 05:20.600
- Aah! Sh--

05:20.633 --> 05:23.467
- You guys!
- Don't hurt your...

05:26.000 --> 05:28.066
- I'm legit gonna have
a third-degree burn.

05:28.100 --> 05:31.033
Nobody else did anything!
- I did, bitch.

05:31.066 --> 05:32.600
- What would you do without me?

05:32.633 --> 05:34.400
You guys would have stood there
like little girls

05:34.433 --> 05:35.767
and been like, "Aah!
What do we do? What do we do?"

05:36.000 --> 05:37.066
- I knew Jojo was running
getting water. I mean...

05:37.100 --> 05:38.633
- Hey, Lisa.

05:38.667 --> 05:41.567
- It'll be open soon.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.266
Hey.
- Hi. How are you?

05:43.300 --> 05:44.500
Good to see you.
- Good. I feel, like, stressed

05:44.533 --> 05:46.400
and rushed and whatever.
- Yeah, same.

05:46.433 --> 05:47.567
- Should we just sit down
for a minute?

05:47.600 --> 05:50.000
- Oh, okay, cool.
Yeah, let's talk.

05:50.033 --> 05:54.600
- I've heard some kind
of altercation went down

05:54.633 --> 05:57.433
at Stassi's book signing.
What happened?

05:57.467 --> 05:59.066
- Um, while the guests
were in here,

05:59.100 --> 06:01.467
Stassi and Katie were
screaming at Sandoval at--

06:01.500 --> 06:03.300
- At her own event?
- Yeah.

06:03.333 --> 06:04.533
- When all the guests are here?
- Yeah.

06:04.567 --> 06:06.500
- Why?

06:06.533 --> 06:08.400
- Because of his rage texts
he sent the night before.

06:08.433 --> 06:09.734
- A rage text.
Is that what it is?

06:09.767 --> 06:11.367
- I don't know. That's--
- Yes, you do.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.367
- I promise I don't.
- Yes, you do.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.467
Got a little look
on your face.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.100
I know looking at him that I'm
not getting the whole story.

06:17.133 --> 06:18.700
I've doing this long enough.

06:18.734 --> 06:20.767
Well, you've spoken
to Sandoval, so you must know.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.667
- He said that he would send me
a screenshot of it,

06:22.700 --> 06:24.100
but I don't have it. I--
I promise. He didn't--

06:24.133 --> 06:25.667
He never ended up sending it
to me.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.133
- Okay, how am I gonna get
the true story here?

06:27.166 --> 06:28.734
He's actually a bit of
a sh--ty liar.

06:28.767 --> 06:32.100

and get to the bottom of it.

Welcome to the SLS South Beach.
Congratulations!

07:23.700 --> 07:24.734
- Thank you!
- We're so happy to have you.

07:24.767 --> 07:26.367

- Oh, delicious!
- Thank you.

07:30.734 --> 07:33.500

Jax Taylor's getting married.

07:33.533 --> 07:36.066
- This is just amazing.
- Oh!

07:36.100 --> 07:37.600
- Some of my best friends
from home are here.

07:37.633 --> 07:39.400
- I remember Marianne.

07:39.433 --> 07:41.533

and my sister-in-law.

07:41.567 --> 07:43.367
Oh, there's Jenny!

07:43.400 --> 07:45.200
Like, this is just amazing.
All these people flew

07:45.233 --> 07:47.567
all the way to Miami
just for us?

07:47.600 --> 07:50.600
- What room are you in?
- I think it's 909?

07:50.633 --> 07:52.066
- 901. Same side.

07:52.100 --> 07:53.633
- Cool. We're right next
to each other.

07:53.667 --> 07:55.500
- So we can cuddle
in the middle of the night.

07:55.533 --> 07:59.033
- Yes, because, um, I will not
be cuddling with Peter.

07:59.066 --> 08:00.734
- You're rooming with Peter?
- No. Yeah, we have two beds.

08:00.767 --> 08:03.166
I mean, it was cheaper,
whatever.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.200
- Hey, everybody.
Since we're just getting here,

08:05.233 --> 08:06.734
to give everybody time, we'll
just order, like, room service

08:06.767 --> 08:08.166
in the room,
and then all the girls

08:08.200 --> 08:09.500
will get into your wedding gowns
tonight.

08:09.533 --> 08:10.467
- Whoo!
- And then we're gonna

08:10.500 --> 08:12.066
split away from the guys.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.433
- See you guys in a little bit?
- Yes. Yes.

08:13.467 --> 08:15.066
- All right, okay.
- Yeah. Okay.

08:15.100 --> 08:17.767
- Bubba, wanna go up?
- Thank you, guys. See you soon.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.734
- Whoo!
- Hey, Stassi, uh...

08:20.767 --> 08:23.133
Hey, so obviously,
our last, uh,

08:23.166 --> 08:25.100
experience together
was pretty rough.

08:25.133 --> 08:26.633
- Yeah, 'cause you're a dick.

08:26.667 --> 08:30.567
- Okay. Um, anyways,
I just wanna apologize

08:30.600 --> 08:33.100
for the text messages
and stuff,

08:33.133 --> 08:35.433
and I just wanna, you know,
say I'm sorry for doing that.

08:35.467 --> 08:38.400
- Yeah, I totally appreciate
your apology. I really do.

08:38.433 --> 08:39.767
'Cause I was shook.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.500
- But, like,
just so you understand, like,

08:42.533 --> 08:44.633
we don't plan events
five days in advance.

08:44.667 --> 08:46.700
Dude, I couldn't sleep.

08:46.734 --> 08:49.100
- Why would you talk to me
like that?

08:49.133 --> 08:52.133
- I get a text message
at 1:30 in the morning from Max,

08:52.166 --> 08:54.767
literally saying,
"We have nobody to work."

08:55.000 --> 08:56.467
The details of this party
were trickling in.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.600
- Okay, well, regardless of it,
it's like,

08:58.633 --> 09:01.433
that has nothing to do with me.
- It hit my stress limit.

09:01.467 --> 09:03.066
- I don't need to hear
the reason why you're a dick.

09:03.100 --> 09:06.066
Just apologize for being
a dick.

09:06.100 --> 09:08.066
No one had a problem with this,
and no one said anything.

09:08.100 --> 09:11.100
You are the only one
that's voicing this.

09:11.133 --> 09:14.433
- What I meant to say is, like,
we can't do this.

09:14.467 --> 09:18.100
Everybody knows that Stassi
loves a great apology.

09:18.133 --> 09:20.066
She's like,
"Yeah, give me that apology."

09:20.100 --> 09:21.567
Guess what. She's getting this,

09:21.600 --> 09:23.667
and that's the best
that she's gonna get.

09:23.700 --> 09:26.000
There's protocol when you're
throwing an event there.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.433
Like, there has to be
a clear line of communication

09:27.467 --> 09:29.066
between me and you.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.600
- Max was aware of everything.

09:30.633 --> 09:32.033
Max's job was to--
- Ken and Lisa, Schwartz--

09:32.066 --> 09:33.533
- Lisa doesn't plan things.
- Oh--

09:33.567 --> 09:35.000
- Schwartz doesn't plan things,
either.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.700
- Well, I'm sorry
that I didn't go to you,

09:36.734 --> 09:38.266
and next time I know
to go to you.

09:38.300 --> 09:41.500
- Yes.
- Yeah.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.467
- Coming up...
- I'm not one to throw

09:45.500 --> 09:47.300
my partner and my good friend
under the bus,

09:47.333 --> 09:50.567
but I think he went--he went
off the deep end on this one.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.667
- You're saying Sandoval
was wrong.

09:57.266 --> 09:57.700
♪ Sunrise, blue skies ♪

09:59.767 --> 10:02.567
♪ Take time to realize ♪

10:02.600 --> 10:04.633
♪ There's a paradise ♪

10:04.667 --> 10:07.633
Bachelorette party!

10:07.667 --> 10:10.133
- Wow.

10:10.166 --> 10:12.200
Oh, this is pretty.

10:12.233 --> 10:15.567
Oh, jeez, it's huge.
- Yeah.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.266
Oh, my gosh.
We have a terrifying balcony.

10:17.300 --> 10:20.066
- Oh, my God.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.166
All for me!

10:23.200 --> 10:26.033
This room is, like,
way too "Pretty in Pink" for me.

10:26.066 --> 10:28.333
It looks like Stassi threw up
all over it.

10:28.367 --> 10:34.066
- Ooh. Looks like I decorated
this sh--.

10:34.100 --> 10:37.100
- Look, there's an OOTD mirror
on the ceiling.

10:37.133 --> 10:39.767
- Tonight is
Miami Rat Pack theme,

10:40.000 --> 10:43.700
so I brought Jax a hat,
and I wanna wear a mustache.

10:43.734 --> 10:46.333
The black shirt with the bow tie
and the mustache.

10:46.367 --> 10:47.734
- I don't think anyone else is

10:47.767 --> 10:49.367
gonna try to look like
a creep tonight.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.567
- Me and Jax have not been
on the best terms lately.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.266
- Once in a while,
can you just say, "Hey, dude,

10:54.300 --> 10:55.567
"you know, I'm still here
for your wedding.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.266
"I can't wait for your big day.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.066
Just letting you know
I'm excited about the wedding"?

10:59.100 --> 11:00.200
- All right, all right,
I'm sorry about that.

11:00.233 --> 11:02.700
But for his bachelor party,

11:02.734 --> 11:04.233
I wanna knock it
out of the park.

11:04.266 --> 11:06.200
Because it's the middle
of the week,

11:06.233 --> 11:08.400
we're literally getting
a giant yacht

11:08.433 --> 11:11.166
that can hold everybody,
food and beverage...

11:11.200 --> 11:12.700
- Oh, my God.
- ...combined,

11:12.734 --> 11:14.700
everything, all included
for, like, 5 grand.

11:14.734 --> 11:19.200
I know Jax is expecting
nothing less than awesomeness.

11:19.233 --> 11:21.567
- We're wearing
our brides dresses.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.133
- This is the only time
I'm ever gonna see you

11:23.166 --> 11:25.166
in a wedding dress,
and you're leaving me.

11:25.200 --> 11:28.400
- Yeah. I'm a runaway bride.

11:28.433 --> 11:32.066
- ♪ Madonna vibe ♪
- I'm nervous about tonight.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.233
- Don't have more fun than us,
because that's not allowed.

11:34.266 --> 11:35.767
- You know how I am
in strip clubs.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.166
If I'm somewhat sober,
I get really nervous.

11:38.200 --> 11:43.600
- This will be the most
covered up I'll be ever.

11:43.633 --> 11:45.633
- Mariposa has arrived.

11:49.266 --> 11:51.100
- Kinda like this.
- That's a woman's top.

11:51.133 --> 11:53.066
- I know, I know. I like you.
I want my belly

11:53.100 --> 11:54.700
to peek out a little.

11:54.734 --> 11:56.600
- Do you?
- Do I?

11:56.633 --> 11:58.266
- Do you?
- I do.

12:01.033 --> 12:02.200
Here you go.

12:02.233 --> 12:04.367
- Thanks.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.400
- Mm-hmm.

12:05.433 --> 12:09.100
- Ahh.

12:09.133 --> 12:11.133
Ew.

12:11.166 --> 12:13.066
- So...
- Oh.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.400
- I saw Sandoval talking
to you.

12:14.433 --> 12:16.066
- Yeah.
- But I didn't wanna interrupt.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.133
What did he say to you
down in the lobby?

12:18.166 --> 12:19.367
- Oh, he was like, "Hey, can I
talk to you for a second?"

12:19.400 --> 12:21.633
He's like,
"I do want to apologize,

12:21.667 --> 12:23.300
"but you have to understand
what's going on with me.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.066
But you have to understand
what I was going through."

12:25.100 --> 12:26.700
- What were you going through?
- No. I'm like,

12:26.734 --> 12:28.400
"Just apologize." It's like
I should never talk--

12:28.433 --> 12:30.066
- "What were you going through
at 2:30 in the morning

12:30.100 --> 12:31.033
"messaging my girlfriend
while she's sleeping

12:31.066 --> 12:32.266
some nasty-ass message?"

12:32.300 --> 12:34.000
- I woke up,
and I saw those texts,

12:34.033 --> 12:36.133
and I didn't wanna go
to my own book signing

12:36.166 --> 12:39.266
that I thought I was doing
in my friends' place.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.166
Like, I would have done it
at ----ing TGI Fridays.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.633
I would have done it somewhere
with good ranch.

12:43.667 --> 12:46.066
Like, this is, like,
what the ?

12:46.100 --> 12:48.467
Like, I did it because
it's my friends' restaurant.

12:48.500 --> 12:51.333
- What he did was
----ing ridiculous and rude.

12:51.367 --> 12:53.066
- And did you hear what Ariana
was saying at the airport?

12:53.100 --> 12:55.266
- No.
- So when I--we went

12:55.300 --> 12:56.667
into the airport bookstore,

12:56.700 --> 12:58.367
and we found my book
in the back...

12:58.400 --> 13:00.033
- Yeah.
- And I went and put it on...

13:00.066 --> 13:01.066
on the front...

13:05.500 --> 13:07.233
It's me, it's me, it's me.

13:07.266 --> 13:09.767
Ariana said twice to Sandoval--

13:10.000 --> 13:12.467
she was like, "I was
in that bookstore for 45 minutes

13:12.500 --> 13:14.500
and I didn't see it in there."

13:14.533 --> 13:17.100
- What, she planted it?

13:24.033 --> 13:25.500
- She's such a whore.

13:25.533 --> 13:27.200
I thought we were great.
- That's what I thought, too.

13:27.233 --> 13:29.367
- I thought we were fine.
There is, like, um,

13:29.400 --> 13:33.300
a spiky-ass stick
up their butts.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.700
- Okay, guys, we're open.

13:48.734 --> 13:51.367
- Do you wanna FaceTime them?
- Hey, Schwartzy.

13:51.400 --> 13:54.400
- Hey, Lisa, how you doing?
It's me and Katie.

13:54.433 --> 13:57.233
We're in Miami.
- I know where you are.

13:57.266 --> 13:59.533
I'm just trying
to get some clarity.

13:59.567 --> 14:01.367
- Hello?
- Hi, darling.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.066
Have you got a veil on?

14:03.100 --> 14:04.734
- We're wearing
tacky wedding dresses.

14:04.767 --> 14:07.133
- Apparently
it went all downhill

14:07.166 --> 14:09.300
when it came to your signing.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.400
So what happened?

14:10.433 --> 14:11.467
- Lisa's calling me.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.200
- Hey, what's up, Lisa?

14:13.233 --> 14:15.133
- I just need to have
a better understanding

14:15.166 --> 14:17.400
of exactly what went down.
I'm sitting here with Max.

14:17.433 --> 14:21.133
- I feel like it's on Stassi
to, like, reach out to me, who,

14:21.166 --> 14:23.166
you know, has to plan
these things.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.033
We just--
there was no communication.

14:25.066 --> 14:27.233
I didn't get a single text,
a-anything from Stassi.

14:27.266 --> 14:28.266
She's just going
through Schwartz.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.033
- Tom just overreacted.

14:30.066 --> 14:32.300
- I'm not understanding
the--the stress here.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.066
- He was worried
about not being, you know,

14:34.100 --> 14:36.166
staffed, but he handled it
very poorly.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.767
- So Sandoval had texted me,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
"You're putting this, like,
all on us.

14:40.033 --> 14:42.133
I'm gonna kick you
the out of TomTom."

14:42.166 --> 14:45.100
I don't know where it came from
- Did he apologize for that?

14:45.133 --> 14:47.166
- He just kept backing up
why he did what he did.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.033
- I sent that text message, but

14:49.066 --> 14:51.266
Stassi literally screamed at me
in the middle of TomTom

14:51.300 --> 14:52.767
in front of customers.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.367
- See?

14:55.400 --> 14:57.433
- I'm not one to throw
my partner and my good friend

14:57.467 --> 14:59.300
under the bus,
but I think he went--

14:59.333 --> 15:01.433
he went off the deep end
on this one.

15:01.467 --> 15:04.300
- You're saying Sandoval
was wrong.

15:04.333 --> 15:07.133
- The way he handled it
was piss-poorly.

15:07.166 --> 15:09.100
And how's your relationship
with Sandoval?

15:09.133 --> 15:12.033
You're still mad with him?
- I saw red.

15:12.066 --> 15:13.533
Like, he put a bad taste
in my mouth.

15:13.567 --> 15:16.100
- At 5 p.m. the night before,
I'm getting told

15:16.133 --> 15:17.333
that there is nobody
to bartend,

15:17.367 --> 15:19.233
so we're gonna have
to bartend.

15:19.266 --> 15:22.233
Like, 65 people all coming in
at once wanting drinks,

15:22.266 --> 15:24.767
and this is when I snapped.
- You know what?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.333
She still was the guest here.
I think maybe

15:27.367 --> 15:30.233
you've gotta kind of just figure
out with her and Schwartz.

15:30.266 --> 15:32.233
Your relationship is more
important with them

15:32.266 --> 15:36.233
than any, you know, event
that's been and gone.

15:36.266 --> 15:40.000
- I just...Yeah. The lesson,
though, is most--Yeah. Okay.

15:40.033 --> 15:41.533
All right, well,
we'll talk soon.

15:41.567 --> 15:43.467
- All right, bye-bye.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.333
I hope that Stassi's event
can be a learning experience,

15:45.367 --> 15:48.567
'cause of the way he interacted
is so unprofessional.

15:48.600 --> 15:52.166
I don't care who it's for.
When it's your business,

15:52.200 --> 15:57.066
keeping calm under pressure
is of utmost importance.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.600
Why does it have to get
so complicated?

16:00.333 --> 16:01.367
Coming up...
- Whoo!

16:01.400 --> 16:04.233
- Ohh!
- Whoo!

16:04.266 --> 16:06.066
- Bachelor...
- Ette!

16:06.100 --> 16:07.567
- Bachelor...
- Ette!

16:20.633 --> 16:22.266
- Good to see you.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.533
Good. I'm glad to be here, man.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.533
This is like our ----ing
stomping ground, dude.

16:26.567 --> 16:28.567
- We're back, baby.

16:31.567 --> 16:33.667
- Oh!

16:33.700 --> 16:36.400
- I got us--I got us, uh,
one bottle of tequila,

16:36.433 --> 16:38.467
one bottle of, uh, vodka.

16:39.467 --> 16:43.133
- I'm dating Satan, so I just--
there's needs to be, like a...

16:43.166 --> 16:46.066
a border somewhere, yeah.
I'll go now--

16:46.100 --> 16:47.300
- Can we--
- I'm gonna go...

16:47.333 --> 16:48.567
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna go over there.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.333
I just--I'm uncomfortable
at strip clubs.

16:50.367 --> 16:52.066
I always have been.

16:52.100 --> 16:53.633
No, no! No!
Get the outta here.

16:53.667 --> 16:55.433
No, no, no. I'm good.
- Sit down!

16:55.467 --> 16:57.467
- I just get uncomfortable.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.233
It's like a roller coaster.

16:59.266 --> 17:02.433
No, no high fives.
That was not a high five, Peter.

17:02.467 --> 17:04.166
And also because I know
when I leave,

17:04.200 --> 17:07.166
I have Satan waiting back
at the hotel room for me,

17:07.200 --> 17:08.600
and that really scares
the crap out of me.

17:08.633 --> 17:11.700
Thank you very much!
That was great.

17:18.600 --> 17:21.200
- We're excited.
That's for damn sure.

17:22.700 --> 17:24.567
- It's amazing how Brittany
was able to get

17:24.600 --> 17:26.600
every single one
of her bridesmaids

17:26.633 --> 17:29.200
in tacky wedding dresses.

17:29.233 --> 17:32.400
Everyone's idea of what's tacky
is very different.

17:34.300 --> 17:37.233
- I mean, I look like I'm
wearing an upside down cupcake.

17:37.266 --> 17:40.266
Ariana--just wearing
a wedding dress

17:40.300 --> 17:42.700
was tacky to her 'cause we know
she's never getting married.

17:45.533 --> 17:48.233
For Lala, tacky meant covering
her entire body

17:48.266 --> 17:50.233
for the first time in her life.

17:50.266 --> 17:52.600
And Scheana just probably pulled
something from her closet,

17:52.633 --> 17:56.367
because she looks the same way
she does every day.

18:00.300 --> 18:03.500
- When I say "Bachelor,"
you say, "ette."

18:03.533 --> 18:04.767
- Bachelor...
- Ette!

18:05.000 --> 18:06.633
- Bachelor...
- Ette!

18:08.467 --> 18:12.233
- Yeah! Love you guys!
Thank you all!

18:12.266 --> 18:14.367
- I'm actually very proud
of Kristen 'cause she's not

18:14.400 --> 18:15.734
crying about how miserable
she is.

18:15.767 --> 18:18.500
She's actually having
a great time.

18:18.533 --> 18:20.367
I think she's really
finding her footing

18:20.400 --> 18:22.500
as a single girl.

18:22.533 --> 18:26.300
- Best bachelorette party ever!

18:35.300 --> 18:36.367
- Yeah.
- I didn't do anything.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.700
I'm not in a fight with Stassi.

18:37.734 --> 18:39.367
I'm not in a fight
with anybody.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.400
I don't know really
what's going on,

18:41.433 --> 18:44.767
but all of a sudden, it's like
everyone's talking about me,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.266
but no one's talking to me.

18:47.300 --> 18:50.567
I'm the one who told Tom not
to text Stassi at all.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.433
And I find that really unfair.

18:52.467 --> 18:55.300
I don't need to be, like,
the next group target.

18:58.233 --> 19:00.367
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

19:02.567 --> 19:05.266
- Yeah! That is talent.

19:05.300 --> 19:06.233
- Whoo!

19:12.367 --> 19:14.333
- No, that's okay.
You don't wanna see them.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.400
- Totally off the subject.

19:18.433 --> 19:20.000
I'm not trying to
make this awkward

19:20.033 --> 19:22.500
for Jax's bachelor party,
but I feel like I need

19:22.533 --> 19:26.600
to have, like, just, like
a quick sit-down with Sandoval.

19:26.633 --> 19:29.567
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.367
- What?

19:31.400 --> 19:33.367
- I just want to have, like,
just a quick powwow.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.767
- Yeah, let's go talk.
Let's go talk.

19:38.300 --> 19:41.200
Ugh. My gosh.
- So I'm just trying to, like,

19:41.233 --> 19:44.333
have a conversation before
everyone gets too wasted

19:44.367 --> 19:45.567
and then...
- Too late.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.200
No, I'm just kidding.
- Are you? Okay.

19:47.233 --> 19:48.633
- No, I'm kidding. I'm not.
- Okay.

19:48.667 --> 19:50.600
I'm kinda just pissed off
about the text message.

19:50.633 --> 19:52.300
I mean, like, you were nasty
to my girlfriend.

19:52.333 --> 19:55.200
You were nasty to your friend.
You sent a nasty

19:55.233 --> 19:56.633
---ing text message.
- I did, I did.

19:56.667 --> 19:58.266
- You should apologize for it
in a better way

19:58.300 --> 20:00.266
than just coming
into the hotel lobby

20:00.300 --> 20:01.767
and whatever you said to her.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.367
- I mean, I feel like
she owes me an apology as well.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.467
- I don't think she does.
- If you're planning a party

20:06.500 --> 20:09.467
at my place,
get--shoot me a text.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.400
Do something.
- So not Schwartz. Not...

20:11.433 --> 20:12.667
- No, just talk to me.
- I know she's close--

20:12.700 --> 20:14.233
But she's also closer
with Schwartz.

20:14.266 --> 20:15.533
- Of course she's closer
to Schwartz.

20:15.567 --> 20:17.033
- So you guys are both
business partners

20:17.066 --> 20:18.633
and at equal levels,
so why wouldn't--

20:18.667 --> 20:20.333
- Schwartz does not know how
to clock in at TomTom.

20:20.367 --> 20:22.066
He does not know how to, like,
ring in a drink.

20:22.100 --> 20:25.333
I've spent 15 years
working behind a bar

20:25.367 --> 20:27.333
learning the ins and outs
of everything.

20:31.333 --> 20:32.667
- Oh!
- It's so cool!

20:32.700 --> 20:35.667
Schwartz spent 15 minutes
behind a bar

20:35.700 --> 20:37.266
and had a panic attack.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.233
- I had
a full-blown panic attack.

20:39.266 --> 20:42.600
- You're being a pussy.
Not only did you let me down,

20:42.633 --> 20:44.266
you let yourself down.

20:44.300 --> 20:45.600
- I'm gonna tell you something,
Beau.

20:45.633 --> 20:47.734
I'm gonna tell you something.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.100
Schwartz is like a "yes" man.

20:50.133 --> 20:51.667
- Then get upset at Schwartz
for not saying,

20:51.700 --> 20:53.633
"You know what?"
- I know.

20:53.667 --> 20:55.567
- "If we're gonna do something,
I need to get Tom on this."

20:55.600 --> 20:57.000
- Exactly, and this is
very Schwartz' problem.

20:57.033 --> 20:58.367
- Then ----ing tell Schwartz.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.100
- I'm sitting here late
at night,

21:00.133 --> 21:02.467
like--like, freaking out,

21:02.500 --> 21:03.767
and I'm thinking to myself,
I'm like,

21:04.000 --> 21:05.600
"Would she ever do this for me?"

21:05.633 --> 21:07.333
- Do what for you?
- Would she ever be, like,

21:07.367 --> 21:08.700
worried about--worried about,
like, how, like,

21:08.734 --> 21:11.500
she's gonna make my party this
or my party that?

21:11.533 --> 21:14.667
No. The fact that she screamed,
belittled me,

21:14.700 --> 21:18.266
attacked me
in front of customers!

21:18.300 --> 21:21.500
- You selfish, egotistical
piece of sh--!

21:21.533 --> 21:23.367
- Yell at me out back!
- They weren't customers.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.500
They were her fans.
- No, they are customers!

21:25.533 --> 21:27.300
They are paying customers!
- Well, that's--

21:27.333 --> 21:29.400
Those were her customers.
- It was at my place.

21:29.433 --> 21:30.767
They were actually my customers.
- Those were her customers.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.433
No, those were her customers
she brought in.

21:32.467 --> 21:33.433
- No, those were my customers,
bro.

21:33.467 --> 21:34.467
- I'm gonna say no.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.000
When I first met Sandoval,

21:36.033 --> 21:38.000
I thought he was just
a really cool guy.

21:38.033 --> 21:40.633
- "Oh, Tom, because it's not
about you?

21:40.667 --> 21:42.767
Oh, you're just jealous, Tom."

21:43.000 --> 21:46.333
- But after all this stuff,
it's just, like...

21:46.367 --> 21:48.533
he's kind of a dick.

21:48.567 --> 21:51.667
Like, I'm done. I said my piece.
- I said my piece, too.

21:51.700 --> 21:53.467
- I wanna have
a really good weekend.

21:53.500 --> 21:54.700
- I do, too, man.

21:54.734 --> 21:56.300
- I don't have any awkwardness
with us.

21:56.333 --> 21:57.767
I want this sh-- squashed.
- Yeah.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.767
- Let's go and have a drink.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.367
- Coming up...

22:05.400 --> 22:06.567
- This is supposed to be
my bachelorette party.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.433
We're supposed to celebrate
my love.

22:08.467 --> 22:09.700
We're supposed
to celebrate my marriage.

22:09.734 --> 22:12.667
So just respect my feelings,
okay?

22:17.700 --> 22:18.333
♪ This all seems right ♪

22:19.767 --> 22:22.600
♪ Getting ready
for the big night ♪

22:22.633 --> 22:25.667
♪ Straight living
that good, lush life ♪

22:27.133 --> 22:29.467
- Hello.

22:29.500 --> 22:32.166
- Um, so these are all the menus
for the party.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.600
Place the menus to the right
of the plate.

22:33.633 --> 22:36.734
- Okay.
- So right now he has G6 and G5.

22:36.767 --> 22:38.533
I'm gonna go ahead and transfer
those to you.

22:38.567 --> 22:40.200
They're just, like,
it's a birthday.

22:40.233 --> 22:42.633
They just working on, like,
desserts and appetizers.

22:42.667 --> 22:44.133
- Are you still training
or not?

22:44.166 --> 22:46.066
- Um, this is
my last training shift.

22:46.100 --> 22:47.567
I'm checking tables.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.767
- Hopefully I can get behind
the bar

22:49.000 --> 22:50.433
and start training
with somebody.

22:50.467 --> 22:53.100
- All right. How are you doing?
- Hi.

22:53.133 --> 22:54.767
I'm doing well. How are you?
- Do you like it here?

22:56.200 --> 22:58.166
- It's been a harder start here.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.100
There's been some great people
for sure,

23:00.133 --> 23:01.567
but then also some challenges
of people

23:01.600 --> 23:03.200
who don't seem like
they want me here.

23:03.233 --> 23:05.033
- Who are we talking about,
exactly?

23:05.066 --> 23:07.000
- I don't want to say,
because I feel like--

23:07.033 --> 23:07.767
- You can say it to me.
I've heard it all before.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.767
I've seen it all before.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.400
- I don't think Scheana's
been very kind to me.

23:12.433 --> 23:14.633
- She knows more than anybody,
'cause when she came here,

23:14.667 --> 23:16.600
the girls were
very kind of resistant of her.

23:16.633 --> 23:18.400
- Which is why it's surprising
for me to hear that,

23:18.433 --> 23:20.133
because of the way
she treated me,

23:20.166 --> 23:21.734
and I just think that
she doesn't like me

23:21.767 --> 23:23.500
for personal issues, and--
- Why personal issues?

23:23.533 --> 23:25.467
What personal issues
have you got with her?

23:25.500 --> 23:27.066
- I'm hanging out with Max.

23:27.100 --> 23:28.500
So when I go to SUR,
I shouldn't wear a t-shirt

23:28.533 --> 23:30.100
that says, "I ----ed Max.
How about you?"

23:30.133 --> 23:31.100
- I would probably keep that
on the D.L...

23:31.133 --> 23:32.533
- I'm gonna wear it. Okay.

23:32.567 --> 23:34.100
...just for the first
couple weeks.

23:34.133 --> 23:36.033
- Okay.
- Well, listen, we don't want

23:36.066 --> 23:37.233
an atmosphere here, and she's
one of the kind of O.G.s now.

23:37.266 --> 23:39.033
- Yeah.
- And she's been here

23:39.066 --> 23:41.533
a long time, so say,
"I'm putting all this work in

23:41.567 --> 23:43.066
because I'm here to stay."

23:43.100 --> 23:45.600
I've seen this before.
Often the new girl

23:45.633 --> 23:49.100
is not welcomed with open arms,
but Scheana should not be

23:49.133 --> 23:52.667
guilty of that because Scheana
has been a victim of that.

23:52.700 --> 23:56.533
Who told you to polish glasses?
- Stassi.

23:56.567 --> 23:58.000
- Right.

23:59.300 --> 24:01.734
- I'll handle it.
- I know you will.

24:10.066 --> 24:11.467
- This is supposed
to be my bachelorette party.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.066
We're supposed
to celebrate my love.

24:13.100 --> 24:13.734
We're supposed to celebrate

24:13.767 --> 24:15.233
my marriage.

24:15.266 --> 24:17.667
I have to hear every
----ing day

24:17.700 --> 24:19.767
from random-ass people
I don't even know.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.066
Then just respect my feelings,
okay?

24:24.100 --> 24:27.200
- So you're probably wondering
how we all ended up here.

24:27.233 --> 24:29.033
Let's start from the beginning.

24:31.266 --> 24:33.767
- Let's go to another club!

24:34.000 --> 24:35.667
- After we were dancing
all night at Shh,

24:35.700 --> 24:37.066
Brittany didn't wanna call it
a night,

24:37.100 --> 24:39.166
so we decided to go
to another club.

24:42.166 --> 24:44.166
- And then all
of the VIP hosts come,

24:44.200 --> 24:47.000
and they have this big sign
that says,

24:47.033 --> 24:48.266
"Don't do it, Brittany."

24:50.066 --> 24:53.734
- At first, Brittany was
laughing at the sign.

24:53.767 --> 24:56.066
But then because of Kristen...

24:58.233 --> 25:00.133
Brittany started to think
that this was some

25:00.166 --> 25:02.600
big, elaborate setup
that the club did

25:02.633 --> 25:05.100
in order to make fun
of her and Jax.

25:09.266 --> 25:11.166
And that's how we ended up
back here,

25:11.200 --> 25:15.100
drunk, crying,
in our wedding dresses.

25:15.133 --> 25:16.567
- I have to hear it
every ----ing day,

25:16.600 --> 25:18.300
people telling me
that they don't like me

25:18.333 --> 25:21.233
and they don't like Jax,
they don't like us together.

25:21.266 --> 25:24.500
So the last thing I wanted was
to come to my bachelorette party

25:24.533 --> 25:27.533
and have to go out
and a ----ing sign

25:27.567 --> 25:29.000
saying, "Don't do it, Brittany."

25:29.033 --> 25:30.633
- But I don't think anyone
was like,

25:30.667 --> 25:32.700
"Oh! Should she not do it?"

25:32.734 --> 25:35.600
I think everyone was like,
"Yeah! Don't do it!"

25:35.633 --> 25:37.233
- I know--
- And, like, our friend

25:37.266 --> 25:39.000
that was there, like, last week,
they said the sign

25:39.033 --> 25:40.734
said the same thing.
I think they kinda do

25:40.767 --> 25:42.600
like, a standardized thing,
and, like, yeah, it's tacky,

25:42.633 --> 25:44.667
but I think that's, like,
kinda the idea of, like...

25:44.700 --> 25:46.600
- We're all
in ----ing bridal dresses.

25:46.633 --> 25:48.233
- We are tacky.
- I mean, the--the point of--

25:48.266 --> 25:50.200
of a bachelorette,
you're supposed to be tacky.

25:50.233 --> 25:52.734
You're supposed to wear penises
on your forehead.

25:52.767 --> 25:54.600
- Yeah, and have fun
and celebrate

25:54.633 --> 25:56.300
and not be, like, told that
you're a piece of sh--

25:56.333 --> 25:58.000
because you're gonna
get married.

25:58.033 --> 25:59.667
- But, babe,
that's not what it was--

25:59.700 --> 26:01.633
- But that's how it felt,
like, "Don't do it, Brittany."

26:01.667 --> 26:03.233
- That was not personal.

26:03.266 --> 26:05.000
- Like, whenever I see
that sh--,

26:05.033 --> 26:06.767
it makes me think, like,
they're talking sh-- to me,

26:07.000 --> 26:08.567
and I did not like it
whatsoever.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.300
- And I completely respect
where you're coming from.

26:10.333 --> 26:12.633
- And you guys wouldn't
like it either if it was you.

26:12.667 --> 26:14.266
Trust me.
- Honestly, Brittany,

26:14.300 --> 26:16.533
I would not have cared.
- Yes, you would've. Lala.

26:16.567 --> 26:18.367
- Babe, I--
- Yes, you would have.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.166
- But just acknowledge the fact
that it hurt her feelings.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.266
- Honey, we've been
acknowledging it

26:22.300 --> 26:24.133
for the past hour and a half.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.066
- No, you've been acknowledging
the way you feel.

26:26.100 --> 26:27.667
- No, I said I respected
what she said.

26:27.700 --> 26:28.767
- Acknowledge that it hurt
her ----ing feelings.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.166
- I did not like it whatsoever.

26:31.200 --> 26:32.667
- And I completely respect
where you're coming from.

26:32.700 --> 26:34.266
Stop. Enough.
- I'm not saying--

26:34.300 --> 26:36.233
- Don't ----ing tell me
to stop, Lala.

26:36.266 --> 26:38.567
- You're ----ing off
your rocker.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.300
Knock it the off.

26:40.333 --> 26:42.633
- Ladies, let's not do this.
- God, bitch. Like, enough.

26:42.667 --> 26:46.166
Everyone Brittany is starting
to calm down,

26:46.200 --> 26:48.333
there's Kristen ----ing Doute,

26:48.367 --> 26:50.367
ready to wind her up again.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.767
- She was upset and everyone
was discounting her feelings.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.100
- Am I going insane?

26:55.133 --> 26:57.166
Put her back in her cage.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.367
- Why are we still
talking about this?

26:58.400 --> 27:00.200
- Yes.

27:00.233 --> 27:03.000
I'm letting it go.
I apologize. I'm letting it go.

27:07.066 --> 27:08.667
- It made me turn, like, red.

27:08.700 --> 27:10.300
It made me, like,
like, very ----ing mad,

27:10.333 --> 27:13.033
because that is my--
I'm getting married.

27:13.066 --> 27:15.400
Like, come on.
Let's celebrate. Let's have fun.

27:15.433 --> 27:17.100
Yes, Jax did cheat on me,

27:17.133 --> 27:20.100
but we've worked so, so hard
to get over this

27:20.133 --> 27:22.767
and move past it all,
and I stuck by his side

27:23.000 --> 27:25.300
because I believe in him
and I love him so much.

27:25.333 --> 27:27.333
- I want you to get to the point
where what people say...

27:27.367 --> 27:29.667
- Yes.
- It doesn't affect you.

27:29.700 --> 27:33.667
Because I get it. People say
some mean sh-- to me.

27:33.700 --> 27:35.600
I'm gonna read you an example.

27:35.633 --> 27:38.767
"News flash, Lala.
Just because giving blow jobs

27:39.000 --> 27:40.200
"gets you a taste
of the rich life

27:40.233 --> 27:42.700
doesn't mean you aren't trash."

27:42.734 --> 27:44.133
It sounds like this person
is mad

27:44.166 --> 27:45.700
because she gives blow jobs,

27:45.734 --> 27:49.066
and it gets her, like,
a 1999 Honda Civic.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.367
You guys are gonna be together
for the next hundred years.

27:51.400 --> 27:53.734
- I know. That's my baby.
- You know? That's your boo.

27:53.767 --> 27:55.300
Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

27:55.333 --> 27:58.100
- Oh, my God!
- Pizza!

28:01.233 --> 28:04.066
- I want to give you pizza.
- Why are you sober?

28:04.100 --> 28:06.066
- Honey, I just went home
because I thought people

28:06.100 --> 28:07.467
were disrespecting you,
and I got mad

28:07.500 --> 28:09.166
and made everybody leave
the bar.

28:09.200 --> 28:10.734
- She really did.
- What?

28:10.767 --> 28:12.033
- They came out
with a sign saying,

28:12.066 --> 28:13.633
"Don't do it, Brittany."

28:13.667 --> 28:15.633
- Whoo!

28:15.667 --> 28:17.300
- What? What is that?

28:17.333 --> 28:19.633
There's chicken bones in there.
- What is that?

28:19.667 --> 28:21.767
- Are you joking?
- I'm really wasted.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.433
- That's such a dude thing
to do.

28:24.467 --> 28:28.300
- Maybe you shouldn't do it.
- Shut up.

28:28.333 --> 28:29.667
- Coming up...

28:29.700 --> 28:32.066
- Dayna--I just don't vibe
with her.

28:32.100 --> 28:33.734
She also doesn't wear
a bra at work.

28:33.767 --> 28:34.734
Like, we're literally talking
outside,

28:34.767 --> 28:36.000
and her nipples are hard.

28:36.033 --> 28:38.300
- Oh, you're mad at her tits.

29:08.533 --> 29:12.166
Are you still drunk?
- Probably a little bit.

29:12.200 --> 29:13.767
We went to this strip club
last night.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.500
I felt so awkward.
I could not get into it.

29:17.533 --> 29:19.433
That is talent!

29:19.467 --> 29:21.033
I was the only one
out of all the guys

29:21.066 --> 29:22.567
who didn't have a girl
next to me.

29:26.533 --> 29:28.166
Every time one of them
would come up to me,

29:28.200 --> 29:30.233
I was just, like, "Ew."

29:33.600 --> 29:36.000
I'm just not good
at strip clubs.

29:36.033 --> 29:38.433
- That's what every guy says
when they go to a strip club.

29:38.467 --> 29:42.033
- Did you fall in love
with a stripper, honey?

29:42.066 --> 29:44.133
- I never even got a lap dance,
I don't think.

29:46.333 --> 29:48.033
No.

29:48.066 --> 29:51.500
- Night number one down,
and no Dark Passenger.

29:51.533 --> 29:55.100
I lasted till 3:40
in the morning.

29:55.133 --> 29:57.233

This is gonna be so dope!

30:13.100 --> 30:15.333
- Hello. Welcome aboard.

on this sh--.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.200

- Good job, dude.

30:20.233 --> 30:21.567
- Thank you.

30:21.600 --> 30:25.400
- About how many, 10?
Can we do, um, 14 shots?

30:25.433 --> 30:30.000
We have every intention
of abusing that open bar.

30:30.033 --> 30:32.233
- Whoo!
- Yeah! Bachelorette!

30:32.266 --> 30:33.367

30:53.400 --> 30:55.300
I feel like Andre the Giant
with this in my hand.

30:55.333 --> 30:57.467
- This is one of my favorite
things we've ever done.

30:57.500 --> 31:02.133
- Yeah, boats and hoes,
that's what we are.

31:02.166 --> 31:03.567
- Scheana, what's going on
in your head?

31:03.600 --> 31:07.000
- What's going on at SUR, dude?

31:07.033 --> 31:09.033
- With what, all the new people
I've been training?

31:09.066 --> 31:10.266
- Yeah.

31:10.300 --> 31:13.266
- Um, Dayna was hosting
at TomTom,

31:13.300 --> 31:15.500
and now she's serving
at SUR.

31:15.533 --> 31:17.400
I just don't vibe with her.

31:17.433 --> 31:19.266
She also doesn't wear
a bra at work.

31:19.300 --> 31:21.300
- I never wear a bra ever,
so I also feel like

31:21.333 --> 31:23.433
that's maybe not a thing here,
but, like, I truly hate it.

31:23.467 --> 31:27.433
- What if it's cold?
- I mean, then I nip. I nip out.

31:27.467 --> 31:29.033
- It's just, like, little things
that just, like, irk me.

31:29.066 --> 31:30.533
- She sounds like me.

31:30.567 --> 31:34.066
- No, but, like, you have
nice, little fake, perky tits.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.500
- Oh, you're mad at her tits.
- No, no, but it's just like

31:35.533 --> 31:37.266
"Wear a bra." Like, we're
literally talking outside,

31:37.300 --> 31:39.066
and her nipples are hard.

31:39.100 --> 31:41.400
- Scheana's definitely jealous
that she's no longer

31:41.433 --> 31:43.266
the center of attention at SUR.

31:43.300 --> 31:46.367
Scheana,
I have the perfect solution.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.166
Show a ----ing nipple.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.633
- Have you talked to Kristen
today?

31:49.667 --> 31:52.567
You're like, "Bitch, you are
off your ----ing rocker."

31:52.600 --> 31:54.400
- Dude, she was off
her rocker.

31:54.433 --> 31:55.600
I just can't talk to Kristen
when she's like that.

31:55.633 --> 31:57.567
- Yeah.
- Ooh, girl.

31:59.567 --> 32:00.667
- Any marriage advice?

32:00.700 --> 32:02.266
- Your first year
is the roughest.

32:02.300 --> 32:04.100
- Why?
- 'Cause you can't leave.

32:04.133 --> 32:06.100
Not that you couldn't. You're,
like, bound with the vow.

32:06.133 --> 32:08.166
You have to honor that.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.567
- We have been through a lot,
and it's like I--

32:09.600 --> 32:10.667
there's no--I couldn't be
without her. I would die.

32:10.700 --> 32:12.400
- Right.

32:12.433 --> 32:14.200
- I just--I just can't
function without her.

32:14.233 --> 32:15.567
- You gotta remember that
when you guys get in fights.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.300
- You know, I've done
a lot of ----ed up sh--,

32:17.333 --> 32:18.367
but I always own
everything I do.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.100
- Yeah.

32:20.133 --> 32:22.066
- A lot of these people
I've done bad things to.

32:22.100 --> 32:23.533
- Yeah, yeah.

32:23.567 --> 32:26.433
- It really says a lot
that they're all here still.

32:26.467 --> 32:28.266
- No, it totally does.
- Because in my younger days,

32:28.300 --> 32:29.667
I've probably screwed over
a good chunk of them.

32:29.700 --> 32:33.133
- Yeah. Even--
Even your future wife.

32:33.166 --> 32:34.300
- Even my future wife.
They're all still here.

32:34.333 --> 32:36.133
- Yeah.
- So I guess that says

32:36.166 --> 32:39.533
something, right?
- No, it does.

32:39.567 --> 32:42.367
- I feel like
a rectangular shape right now

32:42.400 --> 32:43.567
in this swimsuit.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.567
- I mean,
it's not like our style.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.667
- Always.
- I'm gonna steal your girl.

32:47.700 --> 32:48.700
- Okay.
- Right here?

32:48.734 --> 32:50.533
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:50.567 --> 32:53.266
- Yeah, right here.
In the back of the boat.

32:53.300 --> 32:54.734
Last night when I got back
to my room,

32:54.767 --> 32:59.467
I was like, I totally, like,
heightened Brittany's,

32:59.500 --> 33:01.467
like, upsetness.

33:01.500 --> 33:03.100
- I felt like last night
you weren't--

33:03.133 --> 33:04.633
you weren't even hearing me
at all.

33:04.667 --> 33:06.166
- I just don't want us
to talk to each other like that.

33:06.200 --> 33:09.567
- I don't either.
- Because I...

33:09.600 --> 33:12.100
- I don't want you to be sad
about it.

33:12.133 --> 33:13.700
So let's, like, work on that.

33:13.734 --> 33:17.533
I love you. And I love
that you kiss on the lips.

33:17.567 --> 33:20.233
- Last night was a sh-- show.
I slipped.

33:28.567 --> 33:31.433
- Oh, my God.
- And of course I text Carter.

33:31.467 --> 33:32.700
I literally just text him,
"----ing Carter.

33:32.734 --> 33:35.433
I busted my lip."
I was flipping out.

33:35.467 --> 33:36.600
- Dude, what's going on
with that?

33:36.633 --> 33:38.333
- I will see him on Saturday...

33:38.367 --> 33:39.700
- Why?
- ...for a little bit.

33:39.734 --> 33:42.200
I accidentally--My movers
took one of his boxes.

33:42.233 --> 33:43.700
So I don't know
all what it was,

33:43.734 --> 33:46.133
but I know that all
of our sex toys are in it.

33:46.166 --> 33:47.667
- All of your sex toys?

33:47.700 --> 33:49.367
- You know, my stuff
and our stuff.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.133
- Did you sleep together
anytime...

33:51.166 --> 33:51.767
- No.
- ...in recent...

33:52.000 --> 33:53.400
- No.

33:53.433 --> 33:54.400
- No?

33:54.433 --> 33:56.367
- Like, did we have sex?

33:56.400 --> 33:58.667
- Yes.

33:58.700 --> 34:00.767
- We did, like,
before I moved out.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.633
- Kristen.
- I don't know if you'd call it

34:02.667 --> 34:05.166
closure sex
or whatever you'd call it.

34:05.200 --> 34:06.533
I'm not gonna go
a stranger.

34:06.567 --> 34:08.233
Yeah, we've slept together.

34:08.266 --> 34:10.734
Yes, he left a box of sex toys
at my house.

34:10.767 --> 34:12.734
But, like,
it just happens sometimes.

34:12.767 --> 34:16.266
Leave a box of dildoes
somewhere. It's like...

34:16.300 --> 34:18.567
- Why do you think you have
such a hard time

34:18.600 --> 34:20.400
being by yourself?

34:20.433 --> 34:21.700
Don't you think it's best

34:21.734 --> 34:24.000
for you to, like, be single
for a while?

34:24.033 --> 34:25.467
- I hate the term "single"
because it sounds like

34:25.500 --> 34:27.533
Scheana's single
and ready to mingle,

34:27.567 --> 34:29.500
and I'm like...

34:29.533 --> 34:31.266
- Oh, my gosh.

34:31.300 --> 34:33.467
- It literally sounds like
the worst thing ever.

34:33.500 --> 34:35.266
- Are you having fun?

34:35.300 --> 34:36.633
- I'm having a great time.

34:36.667 --> 34:38.400
This is exactly where
I wanted to be,

34:38.433 --> 34:40.533
with who I wanted to be with.
Did a good job.

34:40.567 --> 34:43.567
- We used to share a twin bed
here in Miami.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.667
- I appreciate it. I appreciate
that he's stepping up.

34:45.700 --> 34:47.567
I'm glad. I'm happy.
Thanks for renting the barge.

34:47.600 --> 34:50.333
We'll have--
We're having a good time.

34:50.367 --> 34:53.433
The boat. Sorry.
He rented the boat.

34:53.467 --> 34:56.033
That's not a yacht.

34:56.066 --> 34:58.033
It's amazing.
- Oh, yeah.

34:58.066 --> 35:00.700
- Yeah, nothing can make this
any better. It's perfect.

35:00.734 --> 35:03.400
It's like a booze cruise.
It's the same one that I went on

35:03.433 --> 35:05.333
in spring break
in high school, basically.

35:05.367 --> 35:07.200
Pretty happy.

35:09.700 --> 35:12.300
- I can't drink anymore.

35:12.333 --> 35:14.300
- I, uh, I wanted
to clear the air

35:14.333 --> 35:15.600
because I felt like you guys
were, like,

35:15.633 --> 35:18.233
giving me dirty looks yesterday.

35:18.266 --> 35:19.700
- I couldn't even give
a dirty look

35:19.734 --> 35:21.500
because I couldn't look you
or Sandoval in the eye.

35:21.533 --> 35:23.066
- Why me?

35:23.100 --> 35:24.700
- Because for
the book signing thing,

35:24.734 --> 35:26.266
everyone told me that you were
there just sitting there,

35:26.300 --> 35:28.033
defending Sandoval.

35:28.066 --> 35:30.333
- No, I was telling everybody
that it was a conversation

35:30.367 --> 35:32.333
to be had between Schwartz
and Sandoval.

35:32.367 --> 35:34.367
Schwartz was the one dropping
the ----ing ball here.

35:34.400 --> 35:37.266
- I think it's very unfair
to put that on Schwartz.

35:37.300 --> 35:39.233
Oh, okay, I understand now.

35:39.266 --> 35:41.400
So Tom Sandoval's role
is to take the credit

35:41.433 --> 35:42.734
for everything at TomTom,

35:42.767 --> 35:44.734
and Schwartz' role
is to take the blame.

35:44.767 --> 35:46.333
Makes sense.

35:46.367 --> 35:48.367
- You were then giving me
dirty looks

35:48.400 --> 35:49.734
or no looks or whatever...
- No looks, because...

35:49.767 --> 35:51.367
- ...at the airport.
- When I took my book

35:51.400 --> 35:54.734
from the back and put it
in the front,

35:54.767 --> 35:57.300
Katie said--she's like,
"I overheard Ariana saying

35:57.333 --> 36:00.300
"that, like, 'Well, I was
in that bookstore for 45 minutes

36:00.333 --> 36:02.066
and I didn't see it.'"
- Well, because someone said,

36:02.100 --> 36:03.667
"Look, it's there," and I was
there, and it wasn't there.

36:03.700 --> 36:05.433
And I was like, aren't they
gonna say that, like,

36:05.467 --> 36:07.367
they moved it,
'cause, like, that's new?

36:07.400 --> 36:09.300
- Lala filmed me moving it.
- Okay, that's what I'm saying.

36:09.333 --> 36:12.500
- I don't understand why Ariana
has to make me feel sh--ty

36:12.533 --> 36:14.300
about my book.

36:14.333 --> 36:15.767
I always thought that Ariana
was, like,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.467
this confident woman
who's genuinely happy

36:18.500 --> 36:20.400
for other people's success.

36:20.433 --> 36:23.567
I mean, I'm not that way,
but I thought she was.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.100
Like, it put me in this place
where I'm like,

36:25.133 --> 36:26.767
you know what? I'm like,

36:27.000 --> 36:30.300
I'm sick, of, like,
rolling over.

36:30.333 --> 36:32.600
- Ladies, upper deck for a pic.

36:32.633 --> 36:35.300
- Girls, let's go take a photo!

36:35.333 --> 36:37.033
I need to post it
before these other bitches do.

36:37.066 --> 36:38.400
- ...two, three.

36:38.433 --> 36:41.467
- Women: Brittany!

36:41.500 --> 36:43.033
- Thank you.

36:43.066 --> 36:44.400
- I wanna post it
before everybody else does.

36:44.433 --> 36:46.033
- Of course. Of course.

36:46.066 --> 36:48.033
- Listen, I am the bride-to-be,

36:48.066 --> 36:50.700
so I just wanna be the one
to post the first photo

36:50.734 --> 36:53.500
so that everyone can give me
all the likes and comments.

36:53.533 --> 36:57.367
That's so diva.

36:57.400 --> 36:59.533
- So, we're gonna go back
to the hotel.

36:59.567 --> 37:00.533
Girls are gonna go to Katsuya.
Sorry, guys.

37:00.567 --> 37:02.367
- What?!

37:02.400 --> 37:06.333
- And then we're gonna go
to club with some strippers.

37:06.367 --> 37:08.400
It's girls first,
and then you guys can come,

37:08.433 --> 37:10.100
but we'll let you know
when it's safe.

37:10.133 --> 37:12.667
- We've let you know when we've
motorboated 'em all,

37:12.700 --> 37:15.100
and you can have
our sloppy seconds.

37:16.700 --> 37:18.333
- Coming up...

37:18.367 --> 37:20.100
- It was like a lie to me.

37:20.133 --> 37:22.567
We're not 22.
We can't do this sh--.

37:22.600 --> 37:24.734
It's weird.
- It's messy.

37:24.767 --> 37:26.700
- Well, you're too old
to be messy, Kristen.

37:32.600 --> 37:33.300
♪ We're the toast of town ♪

37:34.567 --> 37:36.200
♪ We wear this place down ♪

37:36.233 --> 37:39.567
♪ And no matter wherever,
whenever we get around ♪

37:41.100 --> 37:42.467
- What are you wearing tonight?

37:42.500 --> 37:44.000
- Basic as outfit.

37:44.033 --> 37:46.166
- Did you bring the steamer?
- Yeah.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.633
- Yo, what's up?

37:47.667 --> 37:49.200
- What are you wearing? Suit?

37:49.233 --> 37:50.734
- Or something adjacent to,
yeah.

37:50.767 --> 37:52.400
- Oh, suits tonight.

37:52.433 --> 37:53.667
- Do you know what
the guys are doing?

37:53.700 --> 37:55.166
- No.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.567
- Are they going to dinner
or anything?

37:56.600 --> 37:58.033
- I don't know
what their plan is,

37:58.066 --> 37:59.200
but they're gonna meet up
with us later.

38:01.033 --> 38:03.433
- This place is cute!

38:03.467 --> 38:05.667
Oh, wow.

38:05.700 --> 38:07.667
- I like to be on the end.

38:07.700 --> 38:10.033
- Do I get to sit
next to the bride?

38:10.066 --> 38:11.600
- Bride-to-be!

38:16.633 --> 38:17.700
I'll have a skinny margarita.

38:17.734 --> 38:19.500
- Have that.
- Tequila.

38:19.533 --> 38:22.500
- I'm ordering shots
for everybody. Let's do it.

38:22.533 --> 38:23.633
- Whoo!

38:24.600 --> 38:26.400
- Hey, hey.

38:32.166 --> 38:34.200
Yeah, it's totally fine.
I'll text you

38:34.233 --> 38:35.533
the code to the house.

38:35.567 --> 38:37.533
- Shots for you here.
- Yay!

38:37.567 --> 38:39.200
- Thank you so much.

38:39.233 --> 38:42.000
- All right, I gotta go. Okay.

38:54.200 --> 38:56.166
- Wait, Tom is the problem?

38:56.200 --> 38:58.000
- Yeah. You can actually, like,
tap her on her shoulder.

38:58.033 --> 38:59.767
- I'll ask.
- You live and learn.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.633
- Do you want a Wagyu beef--
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

39:02.667 --> 39:05.467
Now the issue of whatever
happened at TomTom

39:05.500 --> 39:07.600
the other night is
with Tom Schwartz?

39:07.633 --> 39:10.767
- It's with the event not having
the proper protocol.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.633
- I feel like he's, like,
throwing Tom under the bus.

39:12.667 --> 39:14.433
- Schwartz is the one
who approved it

39:14.467 --> 39:16.467
without going through Max.

39:16.500 --> 39:17.734
There are many layers

39:17.767 --> 39:19.667
of miscommunication
and misdirection.

39:19.700 --> 39:21.533
There needs to be, like,
a set protocol.

39:21.567 --> 39:22.767
- It's just--
It's just frustrating

39:23.000 --> 39:24.633
that Schwartz is now
the problem.

39:24.667 --> 39:26.166
He needs to stop placing blame
on other people

39:26.200 --> 39:28.667
and own his sh--
and say he ----ed up,

39:28.700 --> 39:30.133
his bad, and move on from it.

39:30.166 --> 39:31.700
- He did up
with the text,

39:31.734 --> 39:33.433
but he didn't up
with anything else.

39:33.467 --> 39:35.133
As much as I love Schwartz,

39:35.166 --> 39:38.033
the stress of this book event
was his fault.

39:38.066 --> 39:40.633
He told Stassi,
"We have it handled."

39:40.667 --> 39:43.000
Meanwhile, it was not handled.

39:43.033 --> 39:47.033
TomTom is...better than that.

39:47.066 --> 39:49.033
- I'm just gonna say
it's a bunch of bullsh--,

39:49.066 --> 39:50.667
and that's where
we're gonna end it.

39:50.700 --> 39:53.734
- If you don't wanna fight,
then don't ----ing fight.

39:55.066 --> 39:56.567
- Kristen, where'd you go?

39:57.567 --> 39:59.166
What about?

39:59.200 --> 40:01.600
- He's shooting, and all of
his photography stuff

40:01.633 --> 40:03.600
is at my house,
and he was like,

40:03.633 --> 40:06.033
"Do you mind if I go by
and, like, pick it up?"

40:06.066 --> 40:07.700
"This is the code.
The contractors will be there,"

40:07.734 --> 40:10.066
and, like, the mail key
and, like, sh-- like that.

40:10.100 --> 40:11.567
It's okay.
He's like, "Okay, cool."

40:11.600 --> 40:14.567
- Kristen, you just gave
your house code

40:14.600 --> 40:18.133
to the guy who is garbage
while you're on vacation.

40:18.166 --> 40:21.066
She is never breaking up
with this fool.

40:21.100 --> 40:23.033
At some point, you gotta...

40:23.066 --> 40:24.734
- We're still gonna communicate.
I'm gonna see him on Saturday.

40:24.767 --> 40:26.600
- Then it's not--
Then you guys may as well

40:26.633 --> 40:28.734
just get back together.
I give up.

40:28.767 --> 40:31.200
- Wait. So don't ever, ever

40:31.233 --> 40:33.100
say that I haven't checked in
on you,

40:33.133 --> 40:34.734
because there's nothing
to check in on.

40:34.767 --> 40:36.700
- Stop making this
about you again.

40:36.734 --> 40:38.633
- You're right,
it's not about me.

40:38.667 --> 40:41.266
- It's her bachelorette party,
so we don't need to...

40:41.300 --> 40:43.066
- Okay.
- We should all just be

40:43.100 --> 40:45.100
good friends to Brittany
instead.

40:45.133 --> 40:46.667
- Bad friends once again.
- Bad friends.

40:46.700 --> 40:49.000
Terrible, terrible people.

40:49.033 --> 40:51.033
- This is exactly the thing
that I did not want to happen

40:51.066 --> 40:52.500
at my bachelorette party.

40:52.533 --> 40:54.266
We're here to have fun,
to celebrate,

40:54.300 --> 40:56.033
not sit here and be all awkward

40:56.066 --> 40:57.633
and feel like we can't even
talk to each other

40:57.667 --> 40:58.700
because they're fighting.

40:58.734 --> 41:00.633
- I actually felt really badly

41:00.667 --> 41:03.200
about the fact that
I hadn't been there,

41:03.233 --> 41:04.633
and then the next time,
Carter's there.

41:04.667 --> 41:06.367
- That didn't work for you.

41:06.400 --> 41:09.000
- No, you would not--
It was like a lie to me.

41:09.033 --> 41:10.567
- I literally don't have
to prove anything.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.000
- I just spent another hour
watching you cry--

41:12.033 --> 41:13.233
- Perfect. I don't go to you.
I don't.

41:13.266 --> 41:14.767
- Then bring him around again
and say,

41:15.000 --> 41:16.233
"Everyone, be nice to him."
We're not 22.

41:16.266 --> 41:18.767
We can't do this sh--.
It's weird.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.600
You've just gone back and forth
and back and forth.

41:21.633 --> 41:23.266
- I'm doing the best that I can
day by day.

41:23.300 --> 41:24.633
- You're not doing the best
that you can, Kristen.

41:24.667 --> 41:26.100
- You're not doing anything,
Kristen.

41:26.133 --> 41:28.166
- I am, but it's messy.
- And then--

41:28.200 --> 41:30.300
Well, you're too old
to be messy, Kristen.

41:30.333 --> 41:31.633
- They don't wanna hear
about it.

41:31.667 --> 41:33.367
They don't wanna know
about it.

41:33.400 --> 41:34.667
they don't wanna talk about it,
but they certainly have

41:34.700 --> 41:36.633
a lot of ----ing opinions
about it.

41:36.667 --> 41:38.266
This doesn't feel like love
to me.

41:38.300 --> 41:41.367
- It doesn't feel like love
to me either anymore.

41:41.400 --> 41:44.033
It's like I have, like,
a black heart about it.

41:44.066 --> 41:45.266
- If the roles were reversed,

41:45.300 --> 41:47.233
I wouldn't jump down
someone's throat

41:47.266 --> 41:48.633
because I've been through it
with both of them.

41:52.033 --> 41:53.767
- Excuse me? Excuse me.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.133
- I didn't treat you like that.
- Excuse me.

41:55.166 --> 41:56.700
- Tom was ----ing around on me.

41:56.734 --> 41:58.600
Go yourself, Kristen.

41:58.633 --> 42:01.033
You're a miserable person.
You're miserable.

42:01.066 --> 42:03.600
You've never been happy
in a single relationship

42:03.633 --> 42:05.233
in your ----ing life.

42:10.033 --> 42:12.700
- Next time on...

42:14.367 --> 42:15.567
- Yeah!

42:15.600 --> 42:17.200
- Aah! I love it!

42:20.166 --> 42:21.667
- Give me ones and dollars.

42:23.734 --> 42:24.734
- Jax!

42:24.767 --> 42:26.133
- That's them.

42:26.166 --> 42:27.433
- Is this my future?

42:27.467 --> 42:29.300
- I'm trying to see
some titties!

42:29.333 --> 42:31.333
- So Pride's a week away.

42:31.367 --> 42:34.033
- We're thinking of having James
potentially D.J. on Friday.

42:34.066 --> 42:36.700
I'm confident in the fact
that he really wants this,

42:36.734 --> 42:39.266
and I'm willing to take
the blame.

42:39.300 --> 42:42.166
- She said that you guys, like,
were starting to get serious

42:42.200 --> 42:46.133
and that you, on her birthday,
went home with her best friend

42:46.166 --> 42:47.667
and that's how it ended

42:47.700 --> 42:49.166
and won't acknowledge
her presence anymore.

42:49.200 --> 42:52.000
- Dude, that is such
a ----ing lie.

42:52.033 --> 42:54.033
- you, and she goes,
"I don't wanna be

42:54.066 --> 42:55.700
"your friend anymore.
I can't handle you.

42:55.734 --> 42:57.166
I actually want nothing
to do with you."

42:57.200 --> 43:00.433
- No, I'm frustrated.
- I'm hurt.

43:02.467 --> 43:04.133
- To see more
