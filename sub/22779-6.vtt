[Devlins shrieking]

00:27.986 --> 00:29.612
What y'all running away from?

00:29.696 --> 00:31.781
[speaking gibberish]

00:32.574 --> 00:34.034
I think they might be simple.

00:34.784 --> 00:37.454
I seen this one time before
up in Nebraska.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.915
A pair like these two had their own kind
of talk only the two of them could savvy.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.752
[speaking gibberish]

00:44.544 --> 00:45.545

00:49.007 --> 00:50.091
[Frank] Boys!

00:52.886 --> 00:54.012
Where's your kin at?

01:04.731 --> 01:05.815
[Frank sighs]

01:07.692 --> 01:08.818
These are your folks?

01:16.242 --> 01:17.243
Sister?

01:24.042 --> 01:25.126
[Frank] Who did this?

01:26.711 --> 01:28.713
[mumbling gibberish]

01:31.090 --> 01:32.675
Can you boys talk English?

01:34.219 --> 01:35.220
Savages.

01:36.888 --> 01:37.889
They done it.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.558
Rode in to steal our food.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.063
They cut them up?

01:47.607 --> 01:48.817
And then they shot them?

01:49.526 --> 01:50.944
[sobbing]

01:52.362 --> 01:53.988
They made us shoot them.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.745
[sobbing continues]

02:02.872 --> 02:04.290
[Daryl sobs] They made us...

02:08.336 --> 02:10.213
[Frank] All right. All right, boys.

02:10.296 --> 02:11.923
[sobbing continues]

02:15.468 --> 02:16.886
[Gatz] What do you think?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.263
Comanche?

02:18.346 --> 02:19.389
Kiowa, maybe?

02:20.849 --> 02:22.225
[Floyd] Maybe their spirits.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.103
Whoever done this didn't leave no tracks.

02:26.604 --> 02:28.857
I think it's more than likely
this here "massacre"...

02:29.774 --> 02:30.859
was home-grown.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.362
What are we gonna tell him?

02:42.203 --> 02:43.204
He knows.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.085
[buzzing]

02:51.379 --> 02:53.006
[Gatz] Sometimes the folks you love...

02:54.048 --> 02:55.216
are the folks you hate.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.845
Especially when you're way the fuck out
in the middle of nowhere.

02:58.928 --> 02:59.971
[Frank] Boys.

03:00.930 --> 03:04.017
I'd like you all to meet
Donnie and Daryl Devlin.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.520
They're gonna be riding with us now.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.858
So, from here on, what's ours is theirs.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.195
[echoes] They're family.

03:19.490 --> 03:21.492
[instrumental theme music plays]

[sighs]

04:23.263 --> 04:24.305
[door closing]

04:24.389 --> 04:26.349
Oh, Mr. Grigg. I didn't expect you back--

04:26.432 --> 04:27.767
Get up off your lazy ass.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.811
We've got a special edition to put out.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.855
The fire at the feed store?
Did you hear about that?

04:32.939 --> 04:35.566
I don't mean any damn fire.
Not in this town, anyway.

04:35.650 --> 04:36.734
Come on, move.

04:37.193 --> 04:40.697
I want to get this issue out
and get right back down to La Belle.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.156
What for?

04:42.240 --> 04:45.618
Because I want to be there
when Frank Griffin comes riding in.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.788
-What?
-Here.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.041
You start on these.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.960
I'll write the rest as we go.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.379
Is this true?

04:56.462 --> 04:58.047
I saw it with my own eyes.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.842
Did you warn them poor folks?

05:03.845 --> 05:07.390
Boy, you are slower
than the second coming of Christ. Go!

05:17.692 --> 05:18.735
Excuse me, ma'am.

05:20.361 --> 05:22.238
I wonder if you might
help me with something.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.324
It depends.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.327
I'm looking for this woman.

05:31.539 --> 05:32.665
And who might you be?

05:33.291 --> 05:34.459
Name's Webster.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.128
I'm with the Pinkerton Detective Agency
in Chicago.

05:37.795 --> 05:38.838
Husband hire you?

05:39.338 --> 05:41.591
Mr. Bischoff's very concerned
about his wife.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.009
I'm sure he is.

05:43.551 --> 05:44.969
I'm told she lives here now.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.265
-You just missed her.
-What?

05:50.558 --> 05:51.642
She moved on.

05:51.726 --> 05:54.020
-Must be a week now.
-Any idea where?

05:54.395 --> 05:56.272
Back to Germany is what I hear.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.734
Well, that's unfortunate...

06:00.485 --> 06:04.447
seeing as Mr. Bischoff had brought her
down there to Mexico for her health.

06:05.114 --> 06:07.116
Mr. Bischoff sure sounds like a nice man.

06:08.242 --> 06:09.660
Go through the trouble and expense

06:09.744 --> 06:12.163
of hiring an armed detective
to fetch his wife.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.874
He just wants her back, safe and sound.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.834
"Safe" is one of those funny words.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.503
Sometimes means something different

06:18.586 --> 06:20.546
to the person who says it
and person who hears it.

06:21.464 --> 06:22.507
I don't follow.

06:22.590 --> 06:26.302
Maybe Mrs. Bischoff
felt safer away from Mr. Bischoff...

06:26.928 --> 06:28.096
than with him.

06:28.763 --> 06:32.141
Well, maybe so, but she's still his wife,
and, as such, it's not up to her.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.059
[scoffs]

06:33.601 --> 06:37.230
I didn't realize that "I do" meant, "You
go right ahead, honey. Do as you please."

06:38.314 --> 06:40.399
She was going to take the Southern Pacific

06:40.483 --> 06:43.069
from Santa Fe to New York,
get the boat from there.

06:44.112 --> 06:47.448
Train only runs but once a week, so if you
ride hard, you can make it in a day...

06:48.241 --> 06:49.200
maybe catch her.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.120
Although, I doubt it.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.503
[knocking]

07:00.586 --> 07:01.838
Come on, woman, open up.

07:02.755 --> 07:03.840
[knocking continues]

07:05.049 --> 07:07.635
All right, you best keep yourself
out of sight for a while.

07:07.718 --> 07:10.555
There's a man here from Pinkerton
who wants to...

07:10.638 --> 07:11.764
[Martha] Pinkerton?

07:24.110 --> 07:25.987
[speaks in German]

07:31.492 --> 07:32.326
Shh!

07:32.410 --> 07:35.913
You want to keep your voice down because
the man's probably creeping about outside.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.460
[chuckles]

07:42.670 --> 07:43.671
Oh.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.549
[speaks in German]

07:55.349 --> 07:57.435
I-I'd be scared to wear them, too.

07:58.227 --> 07:59.228
Ja.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.201
Beautiful, yes?

08:16.454 --> 08:17.455
Yeah.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.373
For you.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.211
Me?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.546
No, not for me.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.090
[speaks in German]

08:35.306 --> 08:36.224
Shit.

08:37.642 --> 08:38.518
Shit?

08:38.601 --> 08:40.770
[chuckles] Shit!

08:41.646 --> 08:42.813
Shit.

08:42.897 --> 08:45.024
Well, why didn't she just say so?

08:45.316 --> 08:46.317
Oh!

08:46.400 --> 08:47.610
[speaks in German]

08:48.778 --> 08:50.154
Surprise. Your birthday.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.198
My birthday? Oh, come on!

08:52.657 --> 08:54.492
Well... how did she...

08:54.575 --> 08:56.953
I don't even know anymore
when it's my damn birthday.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.454
[scoffs]

09:01.499 --> 09:02.875
That stupid...

09:05.294 --> 09:06.212
Stupid.

09:10.341 --> 09:11.175

09:12.593 --> 09:13.928
Shit!

09:16.556 --> 09:17.765
Oh, goddamn it.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.778
Let's all keep calm
and talk about this like civilized folks.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.364
Sure. Come on in. Have a seat.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.493
I suggest we all first lower our weapons.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.078
After you.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.000
[chuckles]

09:44.750 --> 09:45.960
Seems we're deadlocked.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.128
Seems so.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.925
Mrs. Bischoff...

09:54.010 --> 09:55.011
your husband...

09:58.472 --> 09:59.599
[Mary-Agnes] Jesus.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.310
[Webster groans]

10:04.645 --> 10:07.648
I'm not sure that was the best way
to handle that situation.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.150
[groans]

10:18.159 --> 10:19.577
[Martha speaks in German]

10:21.579 --> 10:22.788
[speaks in German]

10:29.378 --> 10:30.296
I'm crippled!

10:30.713 --> 10:32.632
I doubt it. Shot went through and through.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.133
Missed the bone, looks like.

10:35.217 --> 10:36.218
Nice shooting.

10:41.557 --> 10:42.683
No, don't!

10:47.271 --> 10:51.400
[speaks in German]

10:58.115 --> 10:59.408
What are you doing?

11:00.451 --> 11:02.119
I don't care none what Otto says.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.873
I just had to see you for myself.

11:05.956 --> 11:09.126
That picture's been in my pocket
for the better part of a year now.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.379
I'd look at your lovely face every night.

11:11.462 --> 11:14.423
You know, I think this fool
may have some feelings for you.

11:15.841 --> 11:16.842
[Webster] Martha.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.180
[speaks in German]

11:22.390 --> 11:23.516
[speaks in German]

11:26.310 --> 11:28.145
I can pretty well guess what that meant.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.529
What are you planning on doing with him?

11:37.405 --> 11:38.739
[gasps]

11:41.117 --> 11:42.326
[whimpers]

11:42.827 --> 11:44.453

[stops whimpering]

11:50.584 --> 11:52.795
[speaks in German]

11:52.878 --> 11:55.089
Your voice is just like it was
in my dreams.

11:55.172 --> 11:57.633
-I'll just be going now.
-[Martha speaks in German]

11:57.717 --> 12:00.010
[Webster]
That's it, just like that. Oh, God.

12:00.678 --> 12:01.929
Oh, God!

12:02.888 --> 12:04.014
Thank you, God.

Come sit with me.

14:35.708 --> 14:36.709
Come on over.

Right there.

[door opening]

15:04.361 --> 15:05.362
What's in the bag?

15:06.530 --> 15:07.573
Something for you.

For me?

15:11.577 --> 15:12.578
[chuckles]

15:27.551 --> 15:29.470
I told you I'd pay you back someday.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.182
It seems like y'all could use it.

15:48.405 --> 15:49.406
Sister?

15:53.911 --> 15:55.663
I knew you would make it all right.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.961
I knew the Lord would hear my prayers
and watch over you.

Children.

16:07.508 --> 16:08.759
This is Mr. Goode.

16:09.343 --> 16:12.346
Now, he... he was once one of you.

16:12.429 --> 16:15.808
And now he is living proof that,
with the help of God,

16:15.891 --> 16:17.726
we can all find our way.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.605
Tell us all about yourself, Roy.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.942
What's made you so successful?

16:26.777 --> 16:27.820
I don't rightly know.

16:27.903 --> 16:29.571
Now, you're being too modest.

16:34.118 --> 16:37.246
It's that light you've got inside.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.622
You can't deny it.

16:43.419 --> 16:44.420
Oh.

16:47.297 --> 16:48.757
I have something for you.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.724
Now, where did I put it?

17:03.105 --> 17:04.273
Thank you.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.151
Now, Roy Goode,

17:07.234 --> 17:11.488
don't you tell me someone
as successful as you still can't read?

17:11.572 --> 17:13.115
Of course I can read.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.325
I-I have to admit,

17:15.409 --> 17:19.580
I was tempted many times
over the years to read it myself.

Why... I can't tell you exactly.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.892
It was... It was so long ago.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.686
It was maybe a year or so after you left.

-A year or so?
-Yeah.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.148

I'm very sorry.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.383
Where you been?

19:37.301 --> 19:40.262
Mr. Goode's... too good for us.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.346
[chuckles]

19:48.854 --> 19:49.855
What's that?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.984
It ain't nothing that concerns you.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.112
Oh.

19:57.738 --> 19:58.864
If it ain't nothing...

19:59.823 --> 20:01.325
why are you cradling it so?

20:06.413 --> 20:08.123
I mean, you ain't even opened it yet.

20:09.708 --> 20:10.876
Let's have us a look.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.506
Right here, "Mr. Roy Goode."

20:16.590 --> 20:17.674
That's you.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.719
"C/O Lucy Cole."

20:21.887 --> 20:23.513
"Moses, New M--" It is Moses, right?

20:23.597 --> 20:24.473
Moses.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.266
And it's from Jim Goode.

20:27.142 --> 20:28.060
You must know him.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.064
"Ata--"

20:32.773 --> 20:33.607
"Atas--"

20:34.524 --> 20:36.818
"Atascadero, California."

20:40.113 --> 20:41.657
Let's see what's on the inside.

20:44.451 --> 20:45.285
[Amos] Oh.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.745
[piano stops playing]

20:50.874 --> 20:51.708
[Roy] Go on.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.336
Open it.

20:57.130 --> 20:58.882
I don't need your goddamn letter.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.194
[Amos grunts]

21:19.278 --> 21:22.489
Mr. High and Mighty's
in one of his fucking moods again.

21:30.038 --> 21:31.290
Who the fuck do you think you--

21:31.790 --> 21:32.749
Roy!

21:33.542 --> 21:34.543
[Floyd grunts]

21:38.714 --> 21:39.840
Roy, come on!

21:53.645 --> 21:54.771
[Floyd groans]

22:07.576 --> 22:08.577
[Floyd groans]

22:11.872 --> 22:13.040
[Floyd cries out]

22:13.915 --> 22:14.916
[screams]

22:16.084 --> 22:17.294
[screams]

22:26.970 --> 22:28.138
[Frank] Roy!

22:28.221 --> 22:29.848
[Frank's voice echoes]

22:33.810 --> 22:35.103
[door clatters]

22:36.980 --> 22:37.898
You can't go.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.318
Who else is gonna help around here?

22:42.027 --> 22:43.528
You don't need my help.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.282
You can take care of things just fine now.

22:47.365 --> 22:48.575
She needs you.

22:48.658 --> 22:50.035
Y'all are going to Boston.

22:50.118 --> 22:52.287
She always says that. We never go.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.378
Look, I'm sorry, kid.

23:04.966 --> 23:06.760
I thought I'd leave this with you.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.059
I don't want it.

23:14.142 --> 23:15.143
[clatters]

23:19.231 --> 23:21.024
Goddamn you, Roy Goode!

23:22.567 --> 23:24.361
Goddamn you all the way to hell!

23:45.674 --> 23:46.883
[exhales]

23:47.551 --> 23:48.552
[sniffs]

23:57.269 --> 23:58.562
Are you mad at me, too?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.261
[footsteps]

26:41.433 --> 26:42.600
[Truckee] Did you read it?

26:46.604 --> 26:48.106
I think he wants us to read it.

26:50.358 --> 26:51.401
Why else leave it?

26:54.988 --> 26:56.406
Well, if you ain't gonna...

26:58.116 --> 26:59.117
I will.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.870
[letter unfolding]

27:03.955 --> 27:04.998
"Dear Roy.

27:05.915 --> 27:07.751
-I am sending--"
-"Aren't" gonna.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.588
The man's got you talking just like him.

27:12.714 --> 27:13.798
I'll read it.

27:16.384 --> 27:17.761
"Dear Roy.

27:17.844 --> 27:21.681
I am sending this letter to Lucy
in the hopes that someday it finds you.

27:22.974 --> 27:25.352
I am writing
after all these years of absence

27:25.435 --> 27:29.689
to tell you that I have never forgotten
about you or my promise to you...

27:30.315 --> 27:32.984
but I wanted a life for you
that you deserved.

27:34.277 --> 27:36.988
I've learned
that life is a gift we are given,

27:37.072 --> 27:40.325
and that we should live it with honor
and, God willing,

27:40.408 --> 27:42.786
leave something of our best selves behind.

27:44.204 --> 27:48.333
I know now that money matters
only to the man with a small mind.

27:49.209 --> 27:53.213
The harder thing is to do
the best one can with what one has.

27:54.255 --> 27:57.175
I learned these words
and thoughts from reading...

27:57.801 --> 28:00.720
something I should have learned
how to do a long time ago.

28:01.471 --> 28:05.183
Something I should have taught you,
and maybe saved you some heartache.

28:06.684 --> 28:07.852
The truth is,

28:07.936 --> 28:12.107
books have taught me that I am not at all
the man I could have been,

28:12.190 --> 28:13.316
but I want to try.

28:14.150 --> 28:19.406
I'm asking you to come now
to the Atascadero territory in California

28:19.489 --> 28:20.990
and live with me and my wife.

28:21.491 --> 28:23.410
Yes, I got me a wife.

28:23.493 --> 28:26.329
I have a son, too. His name is Roy.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.045
He's but three.

28:36.214 --> 28:38.591
And you won't never believe
the job I got...

28:39.467 --> 28:41.803
so I'm not even gonna bother
telling you about it,

28:41.886 --> 28:43.388
unless I see you in person...

28:44.139 --> 28:45.640
which I'm hoping I will.

28:47.183 --> 28:48.935
I live near the Pacific Ocean,

28:49.018 --> 28:50.812
as I always said I would,

28:50.895 --> 28:53.356
and it is everything
I always said it would be.

28:54.065 --> 28:55.650
I can't wait for you to see it.

28:56.192 --> 29:01.156
I don't think I have ever seen
a body of water so big or so beautiful.

29:01.906 --> 29:04.701
They got fish in there
the size of plow horses.

29:05.660 --> 29:10.290
And the water itself is the cleanest
and clearest I have ever seen or touched.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.793
You look out and all you see is blue.

29:14.461 --> 29:17.589
Blue sky, blue water. It's overwhelming.

29:18.298 --> 29:21.134
You feel as if you're on the edge
of something powerful.

29:21.843 --> 29:23.344
This place has changed me,

29:23.428 --> 29:25.513
and I do believe it will change you, too.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.809
I know I ain't been the brother
you needed me to be.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.313
I know I ran off
when you needed my protection.

29:34.230 --> 29:37.275
But I'm asking you now
to come to Atascadero

29:37.358 --> 29:38.943
and give me a second chance.

29:39.903 --> 29:43.198
To let me teach you the things
I should have taught you long ago.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.116
Take your time.

29:45.658 --> 29:47.327
I will always be here, waiting.

29:48.828 --> 29:50.997
Your loving brother, Jim."

29:54.751 --> 29:56.002
[Truckee] Atascadero.

29:56.961 --> 29:58.171
Sounds nice.

29:59.255 --> 30:00.757
Think that's where he's headed?

30:08.264 --> 30:09.265
I hope so.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.353
[fire crackling]

30:13.436 --> 30:14.771
In the absence of God...

30:15.939 --> 30:19.234
it's up to men like us
to make the important decisions.

30:20.819 --> 30:24.405
For it's the ancient fears of loneliness,

30:24.489 --> 30:27.534
sickness and poverty
that create men like us.

30:28.117 --> 30:29.285
[Frank] Very good.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.246
[Daryl]
The book says death ain't no big deal.

30:31.746 --> 30:32.997
[laughs]

30:33.081 --> 30:36.292
-It's dying that's no goddamn fun.
-[Frank] That's right.

30:36.376 --> 30:37.961
The man that lays down like a lamb...

30:38.670 --> 30:39.671
stays down.

30:40.755 --> 30:43.591
[Donnie] Only thing a man
can truly count on is hisself.

30:44.509 --> 30:45.510
Amen.

30:49.222 --> 30:51.724
You rinse out that coffee pot
before you started brewing?

30:52.141 --> 30:54.185
-I did.
-Sure don't taste like it.

30:54.894 --> 30:55.937
Well, I did.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.107
Frank.

30:59.816 --> 31:01.860
That old arm of yours
is getting pretty ripe.

31:04.195 --> 31:05.613
[flies buzzing]

31:36.060 --> 31:37.645
Where the hell is La Belle?
