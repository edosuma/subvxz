00:10.235 --> 00:12.613
<i>I feel the sun on my face.</i>

00:13.238 --> 00:15.657
<i>I see trees all around me.</i>

00:15.949 --> 00:20.412
<i>Scent of wildflowers on a breeze.
It's so beautiful.</i>

00:25.542 --> 00:28.837
<i>In this moment,
I'm not stranded in space.</i>

00:31.131 --> 00:34.926
<i>It's been 97 years since a nuclear
apocalypse killed everyone on Earth</i>

00:35.093 --> 00:37.596
<i>leaving the planet
simmering in radiation.</i>

00:37.721 --> 00:40.265
<i>Fortunately, there were survivors.</i>

00:41.183 --> 00:44.853
<i>Twelve nations had operational space
stations at the time of the bombs.</i>

00:45.937 --> 00:50.400
<i>There is now only the Ark,
one station forged from the many.</i>

00:52.944 --> 00:56.531
<i>We're told the earth needs another
100 years to become survivable again.</i>

00:56.657 --> 00:59.868
<i>Four more space-locked generations
and man can go home.</i>

00:59.993 --> 01:01.286
<i>Back to the ground.</i>

01:02.037 --> 01:04.790
<i>The ground, that's the dream.</i>

01:04.956 --> 01:06.500
<i>This is reality.</i>

01:08.043 --> 01:10.420
Prisoner 319, face the wall.

01:10.545 --> 01:11.922
<i>Reality sucks.</i>

01:13.632 --> 01:15.050
- What is this?
- Quiet.

01:16.176 --> 01:17.803
- Hold out your right arm.
- No!

01:17.969 --> 01:19.137
No, it's not my time.

01:19.262 --> 01:21.502
- I don't turn 18 for another month.
- Hold out your arm.

01:21.598 --> 01:25.394
<i>On The Ark, every crime, no
matter how small, is punishable by death.</i>

01:25.519 --> 01:26.603
<i>Unless you're under 18.</i>

01:26.728 --> 01:28.414
- Take your watch...
- No, it was my father's.

01:28.438 --> 01:30.148
- Take your...
- No!

01:37.406 --> 01:40.409
<i>Juvenile offenders get put here.
Lock up.</i>

01:40.742 --> 01:42.494
<i>We call it the Sky Box.</i>

01:44.996 --> 01:46.707
- Prisoner 319.
- Clarke, stop!

01:47.833 --> 01:48.834
Wait here.

01:49.334 --> 01:50.335
Mom?

01:50.502 --> 01:52.337
Mom, what's going on?

01:53.213 --> 01:54.297
What is this?

01:55.257 --> 01:57.050
They're killing us all, aren't they?

01:57.175 --> 01:59.511
Reducing population to make more time
for the rest of you.

01:59.678 --> 02:02.097
Clarke, you are not being executed.

02:02.347 --> 02:03.849
You're being sent to the ground.

02:04.349 --> 02:06.017
- All one hundred of you.
- What?

02:06.351 --> 02:09.562
But it's not safe.
No, we get reviewed at 18.

02:10.020 --> 02:13.108
The rules have changed.
This gives you a chance to live.

02:14.443 --> 02:17.738
Your instincts will tell you
to take care of everybody else first.

02:18.029 --> 02:20.282
Just like your father.
But be careful.

02:20.407 --> 02:21.783
I can't lose you too.

02:22.159 --> 02:23.744
I love you so much.

02:30.459 --> 02:33.879
Earth, Clarke.
You need to go to Earth.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.701
Welcome back.

03:06.912 --> 03:09.206
- Look...
- Wells, why the hell are you here?

03:09.915 --> 03:11.893
When I found out they were
sending prisoners to the ground

03:11.917 --> 03:12.918
I got myself arrested.

03:14.002 --> 03:15.003
I came for you.

03:19.257 --> 03:21.134
- What was that?
- That was the atmosphere.

03:22.928 --> 03:25.263
<i>Prisoners of the Ark, hear me now.</i>

03:25.680 --> 03:27.474
<i>You've been given a second chance.</i>

03:27.974 --> 03:30.602
<i>And as your chancellor,
it is my hope that you see this</i>

03:30.769 --> 03:33.980
<i>as not just a chance for you
but a chance for all of us</i>

03:34.105 --> 03:36.191
<i>indeed for mankind itself.</i>

03:36.316 --> 03:38.819
<i>We have no idea what is
waiting for you down there.</i>

03:38.944 --> 03:41.488
<i>If the odds of survival were better
we would have sent others.</i>

03:41.613 --> 03:45.784
<i>Frankly, we're sending you, because
your crimes have made you expendable.</i>

03:46.159 --> 03:48.221
<i>- If, however, you do survive...</i>
- Your dad's a dick, Wells.

03:48.245 --> 03:51.957
<i>then those crimes will be forgiven.
Your records wiped clean.</i>

03:57.254 --> 03:59.464
I saw a ship launch,
not more than 20 minutes ago.

03:59.631 --> 04:02.300
- Who was on it?
- Was it the prisoners? They're just kids.

04:02.425 --> 04:04.469
Are they going to Earth?
Has something changed?

04:04.636 --> 04:08.139
As I said, at this time,
we cannot confirm or deny anything.

04:08.265 --> 04:09.266
Come on, lady!

04:11.101 --> 04:12.477
Is my son on that ship?

04:15.772 --> 04:17.357
<i>The drop site
has been chosen carefully.</i>

04:17.524 --> 04:18.942
<i>Before the last war,</i>

04:19.024 --> 04:21.486
<i>Mount Weather was a military base
built within a mountain.</i>

04:21.611 --> 04:25.532
<i>It was to be stocked with enough
non-perishables to sustain 300 people...</i>

04:26.658 --> 04:31.705
<i>...for up to two years.
No one ever made it there.</i>

04:32.789 --> 04:34.165
<i>- Because we...</i>
- Check it out.

04:34.332 --> 04:36.543
<i>- Spare you no food...</i>
- Your dad floated me after all.

04:37.502 --> 04:39.504
Should strap in before the
parachutes are deployed.

04:40.046 --> 04:42.215
Hey, you two!
Stay put if you want to live.

04:42.757 --> 04:47.846
<i>Mount Weather is life. You must
locate those supplies immediately.</i>

04:47.971 --> 04:50.032
You're the traitor who's been
in solitary for a year.

04:50.056 --> 04:53.018
You're the idiot who wasted a month
of oxygen on an illegal space walk.

04:53.184 --> 04:54.185
But it was fun.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.228
I'm Finn.

04:56.354 --> 04:58.690
<i>One responsibility.
Stay alive.</i>

05:01.026 --> 05:02.485
<i>Finally... I'm sure you're
wondering</i>

05:02.611 --> 05:04.571
<i>- about those wristbands...</i>
- Stay in your seats!

05:11.369 --> 05:12.370
Finn, are you okay?

05:13.496 --> 05:14.664
Ah!

05:18.168 --> 05:19.169
Not now.

05:20.211 --> 05:22.631
Total system failure.
That's what we're looking at.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.525
All we know for sure is that they
were off course

05:24.549 --> 05:26.861
- when we lost contact, so...
- Tell me about communications.

05:26.885 --> 05:28.613
Other than the telemetry from the
wristbands, we got nothing.

05:28.637 --> 05:30.555
No audio, no video.
No computer link.

05:30.722 --> 05:33.058
Everything that we programmed in
to help them is gone.

05:33.224 --> 05:34.309
They're on their own now.

05:36.061 --> 05:38.021
- Retrorockets ought to have fired by now.
- Okay.

05:38.063 --> 05:39.999
Everything on this ship is
a hundred years old right?

05:40.023 --> 05:43.068
- Just give it a second.
- Look, there's something I have to tell you.

05:43.818 --> 05:45.403
I'm sorry I got your father arrested.

05:45.570 --> 05:47.197
Don't you talk about my father.

05:47.322 --> 05:50.075
Please, I can't die
knowing that you hate me.

05:50.241 --> 05:52.911
They didn't arrest my father, Wells.
They executed him.

05:53.036 --> 05:54.245
I do hate you.

06:16.559 --> 06:17.560
Listen...

06:19.229 --> 06:20.230
No machine hum.

06:22.065 --> 06:23.858
Whoa!

06:24.109 --> 06:25.109
That's a first.

06:32.826 --> 06:33.952
Finn, is he breathing?

06:37.998 --> 06:40.417
The outer doors are
on the lower level. Let's go.

06:40.542 --> 06:42.460
No, we can't just open the doors.

06:45.130 --> 06:46.923
Hey, just back it up guys.

06:48.091 --> 06:49.092
Stop!

06:52.679 --> 06:53.888
The air could be toxic.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.654
If the air's toxic,
we're all dead anyway.

06:56.057 --> 06:57.267
Bellamy?

07:05.108 --> 07:06.901
That's the girl they
hid under the floor.

07:12.323 --> 07:13.491
My god!

07:14.117 --> 07:15.326
Look how big you are.

07:21.207 --> 07:23.585
What the hell are you wearing?
A guard's uniform?

07:23.710 --> 07:25.336
I borrowed it to get on the
dropship.

07:26.671 --> 07:28.214
Someone's got to keep an eye
on you.

07:30.175 --> 07:31.509
Where's your wristband?

07:31.968 --> 07:34.554
Do you mind?
I haven't seen my brother in a year.

07:34.679 --> 07:35.930
No one has a brother.

07:36.723 --> 07:39.434
That's Octavia Blake.
The girl they found hidden in the floor.

07:40.769 --> 07:42.520
Octavia, no!

07:43.354 --> 07:45.356
Let's give them something else
to remember you by.

07:45.482 --> 07:46.524
Yeah? Like what?

07:47.108 --> 07:49.778
Like being the first person
on the ground in a hundred years.

08:43.998 --> 08:46.835
We're back bitches!

09:32.964 --> 09:34.591
Why so serious, princess?

09:35.800 --> 09:37.969
It's not like we died
in a fiery explosion.

09:39.179 --> 09:42.140
Tell that to the two guys, who tried
to follow you out of their seats.

09:45.935 --> 09:49.731
You don't like being called princess.
Do you, princess?

09:50.315 --> 09:51.691
Do you see that peak over there?

09:53.610 --> 09:54.652
Yeah.

09:55.153 --> 09:56.196
Mount Weather.

09:56.988 --> 09:59.699
There's a radiation-soaked forest
between us and our next meal.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.329
They dropped us
on the wrong damn mountain.

10:11.711 --> 10:12.837
Here it is.

10:13.338 --> 10:15.673
We know they've landed,
but communication's down.

10:15.840 --> 10:18.343
Which means we're still blind
to conditions on the ground.

10:19.177 --> 10:20.257
Thanks to Abby's wristbands

10:20.345 --> 10:23.848
at least we know how those
conditions affect the human body.

10:23.973 --> 10:27.268
Which is more than we've had
for hundred years. So...

10:28.186 --> 10:30.688
...nice work.
Now, what are they telling us?

10:31.898 --> 10:34.692
Two dead kids. Dark tiles.

10:37.153 --> 10:40.323
Dr. Jackson, please share our theory
with Counselor Kane.

10:40.448 --> 10:43.209
Of course. Granted, they've only been
on the ground for seven minutes.

10:43.368 --> 10:47.121
But as of now, we believe the
fatalities are due to the landing.

10:47.413 --> 10:48.413
Not radiation levels.

10:48.539 --> 10:52.043
Both boys died at the same time that
we lost contact with the dropship.

10:52.210 --> 10:54.712
- Rough landing? That's your theory?
- The dots connect.

10:54.879 --> 10:56.506
Would you agree
that if it was radiation

10:56.631 --> 10:59.342
we'd see fatalities
climb fairly quickly now

10:59.467 --> 11:02.262
because I'm noticing a lot of red
on that board.

11:02.845 --> 11:04.055
Spiking vital signs.

11:04.180 --> 11:07.308
Two possibilities.
One, injuries sustained during landing.

11:07.433 --> 11:08.518
And the other?

11:08.643 --> 11:10.061
They're excited to be there.

11:19.654 --> 11:22.448
We got problems.
The communication system is dead.

11:22.949 --> 11:26.077
I went to the roof. A dozen panels
are missing. Heat fried the wires.

11:26.744 --> 11:29.163
All that matters right now is
getting to Mount Weather.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.249
See, look. This is us.

11:31.749 --> 11:34.377
This is where we need to get to
if you want to survive.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.629
Where did you learn to do that?

11:39.424 --> 11:40.425
Your father.

11:42.051 --> 11:43.469
Cool, a map.

11:43.594 --> 11:45.489
Can I get a bar in this town?
I'll buy you a beer.

11:45.513 --> 11:47.265
- You mind?
- Hey!

11:48.641 --> 11:50.059
Hands off of him.
He's with us.

11:51.644 --> 11:52.645
Relax.

11:53.646 --> 11:54.915
We're just trying to figure out
where we are.

11:54.939 --> 11:57.150
We're on the ground.
Is that not good enough for you?

11:59.277 --> 12:02.572
We need to find Mount Weather.
You heard my father's message.

12:02.697 --> 12:05.283
- That has to be our first priority.
- Screw your father.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.994
What?
You think you're in charge here?

12:08.578 --> 12:10.955
You and little princess?

12:11.122 --> 12:13.583
Do you think we care
who's in charge?

12:13.958 --> 12:15.501
We need to get to Mount Weather.

12:15.626 --> 12:19.130
Not because the chancellor said so,
because the longer we wait

12:19.255 --> 12:21.299
the hungrier we'll get
and the harder this will be.

12:21.758 --> 12:24.302
How long do you think we'll last
without those supplies?

12:25.053 --> 12:27.847
We're looking at a 20-mile trek.
Okay?

12:27.972 --> 12:31.642
So if we want to get there before dark,
we need to leave. Now.

12:31.768 --> 12:35.271
I got a better idea. You two go.
Find it for us.

12:35.396 --> 12:37.398
Let the privileged do the hard work
for a change.

12:37.523 --> 12:38.566
Yeah.

12:39.108 --> 12:41.611
You're not listening.
We all need to go.

12:41.736 --> 12:44.739
Look at this, everybody.
Chancellor of Earth.

12:44.906 --> 12:46.532
You think that's funny?

12:47.617 --> 12:48.618
Wells!

12:48.951 --> 12:49.827
Come on, get him!

12:49.952 --> 12:51.037
No, but that was.

12:52.121 --> 12:53.121
All right.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.212
Come on.

13:06.260 --> 13:10.515
Kid's got one leg.
How about you wait until it's a fair fight.

13:13.017 --> 13:14.352
Hey, Space Walker.

13:16.270 --> 13:17.438
Rescue me next.

13:26.823 --> 13:28.408
What? He's cute.

13:29.575 --> 13:31.619
- He's a criminal.
- They're all criminals.

13:32.286 --> 13:34.831
Look, I came down here
to protect you.

13:34.956 --> 13:36.207
I don't need protecting.

13:36.374 --> 13:38.793
I have been locked up
one way or another all my life.

13:38.918 --> 13:40.711
I am done following orders.

13:41.921 --> 13:43.297
I need to have fun, Bell.

13:43.714 --> 13:46.426
I need to do something crazy
just because I can.

13:46.551 --> 13:49.303
And no one, including you,
is gonna stop me.

13:49.720 --> 13:52.432
- I can't stay with them.
- Now what're you talking about?

13:55.143 --> 13:58.187
I did something, okay?
To get on the dropship.

13:58.312 --> 14:00.857
Something that they will kill me for
when they come down.

14:00.982 --> 14:04.110
I can't say what it is just yet.
But you have to trust me.

14:05.111 --> 14:06.737
You do still trust me, don't you?

14:08.698 --> 14:09.699
Yeah.

14:12.034 --> 14:14.579
So, Mount Weather.
When do we leave?

14:15.913 --> 14:16.914
Right now.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.959
We'll be back tomorrow with food.

14:21.002 --> 14:23.242
How the two of you gonna
carry enough food for a hundred?

14:27.967 --> 14:29.051
Four of us.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.345
- Can we go now?
- Sounds like a party.

14:31.929 --> 14:34.098
- Make it five.
- Hey! What the hell are you doing?

14:34.265 --> 14:35.349
- Going for a walk.
- Hey!

14:37.310 --> 14:40.229
- Were you trying to take this off?
- Yeah. So?

14:40.354 --> 14:43.107
So this wristband transmits
your vital signs to the Ark.

14:43.983 --> 14:45.419
Take it off and they'll think
you're dead.

14:45.443 --> 14:47.028
- Should I care?
- Well, I don't know.

14:47.153 --> 14:49.363
Do you want the people you love
to think you're dead?

14:49.489 --> 14:51.508
Do you want them to follow you
down here in two months?

14:51.532 --> 14:53.993
Because they won't
if they think we're dying.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.332
Okay.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.166
Let's go.

15:07.798 --> 15:08.799
Go on.

15:15.431 --> 15:16.891
Shouldn't have come here, Wells.

15:29.570 --> 15:32.573
Before you get any ideas,
Finn's mine.

15:33.074 --> 15:35.159
Before you get any ideas,
I don't care.

15:38.246 --> 15:40.456
Hey, darling.
How's Clarke?

15:41.958 --> 15:43.584
Her vital signs are strong.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.503
Blood sugar's low.
She hasn't eaten.

15:48.339 --> 15:49.549
This is Dr. Griffin.

15:51.842 --> 15:53.010
On my way!

15:53.177 --> 15:55.054
Jackson, put it out there.
We need blood.

15:55.179 --> 15:56.514
A-neg and a lot of it.

15:56.681 --> 15:58.015
And then get your ass to the OR.

15:58.140 --> 15:59.725
Abby? What's wrong?

16:00.101 --> 16:01.269
The chancellor's been shot.

16:15.074 --> 16:19.870
- That, my friend, is game.
- That, my friend, is poison sumac.

16:20.037 --> 16:23.040
- What! It is?
- The flowers aren't poisonous.

16:23.165 --> 16:24.792
They're medicinal.
Calming, actually.

16:25.876 --> 16:28.212
His family grows all the
pharmaceuticals on the Ark.

16:28.379 --> 16:30.339
Hey, guys!
Would you try to keep up?

16:30.464 --> 16:33.175
Come on, Clarke.
How do you block all this out?

16:33.301 --> 16:36.929
Well, it's simple. I wonder,
why haven't we seen any animals?

16:37.555 --> 16:39.056
Maybe, it's because
there are none.

16:39.181 --> 16:42.810
Maybe we've already been exposed to
enough radiation to kill us.

16:43.269 --> 16:45.563
Sure is pretty though.
Come on.

16:46.772 --> 16:49.066
Someone should slip her
some poison sumac.

16:53.946 --> 16:56.198
I gotta know what you two did
to get busted.

16:56.782 --> 17:00.077
Sumac's not the only herb
in the garden, if you know what I mean.

17:00.202 --> 17:01.912
Someone forgot to replace
what we took.

17:02.079 --> 17:03.914
Someone's apologized
like a thousand times.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.291
How about you, Octavia?
What did they get you for?

17:08.794 --> 17:09.795
Being born.

17:11.589 --> 17:13.257
That is so not game.

17:25.935 --> 17:26.979
No animals, huh?

17:49.960 --> 17:51.545
Chancellor has lost a lot of blood.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.799
- If only they found him sooner.
- Damn it!

17:54.924 --> 17:56.133
Abby, he's waking up.

17:57.718 --> 17:58.844
Increase anesthesia.

17:59.804 --> 18:02.404
We used way too much blood in
anesthesia. We're way over the line.

18:03.516 --> 18:04.975
Your chancellor's going into shock.

18:05.351 --> 18:06.977
You're asking me to break the law.

18:07.144 --> 18:08.688
Fine, I'll do it myself.

18:08.854 --> 18:09.854
Let them come after me.

18:10.481 --> 18:13.567
Excuse me, sir. You asked to be notified
if there was news.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.404
The chancellor's still in surgery.
But we have ID'd the shooter.

18:17.488 --> 18:19.848
Bellamy Blake is the only person on
the Ark unaccounted for.

18:19.990 --> 18:21.367
- Who is he?
- He's no one.

18:21.492 --> 18:23.244
A janitor.
We're still working up a profile.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.089
But his motive for going to Earth is clear.

18:25.955 --> 18:27.832
Sister. I remember.

18:28.999 --> 18:32.503
Her mother kept her hidden
for almost 16 years. Nearly a record.

18:33.671 --> 18:35.315
What is it, Commander Shumway?
Spit it out.

18:35.339 --> 18:36.716
We can start now.

18:37.007 --> 18:38.718
As chancellor pro tempore,

18:38.843 --> 18:41.262
you can give the order to start
reducing the population.

18:44.849 --> 18:46.016
Not yet.

18:46.183 --> 18:47.685
Sir, we're wasting time.

18:48.644 --> 18:52.231
Removing the 100 from the population
only buys us another month.

18:52.356 --> 18:54.692
Engineering needs more than
that to fix those systems

18:54.775 --> 18:57.255
- if they can fix them at all.
- You have my answer, Commander.

18:57.862 --> 18:58.863
Enough.

19:00.030 --> 19:02.324
If we're gonna kill
hundreds of innocent people...

19:03.367 --> 19:05.536
...we're gonna do it by the book.
Is that clear?

19:06.871 --> 19:07.872
In the meantime

19:07.997 --> 19:11.208
I want to know who helped this
janitor get on that dropship.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.836
Because he sure as hell
didn't do it by himself.

19:14.295 --> 19:16.922
Seems we have a traitor in our midst,
Commander.

19:17.047 --> 19:19.884
And the hundred have an assassin
in theirs.

19:27.057 --> 19:29.310
- Find any water yet?
- No, not yet.

19:31.562 --> 19:33.397
I'm going back out
if you want to come.

19:41.864 --> 19:45.576
You know, my father, he begged for
mercy in the airlock chamber

19:45.701 --> 19:47.453
when your father floated him.

19:51.415 --> 19:53.334
Spelled "die" wrong, geniuses.

19:57.963 --> 20:00.643
If you're gonna kill someone,
it's probably best not to announce it.

20:02.384 --> 20:04.304
You're not really a member
of the guard, are you?

20:04.428 --> 20:07.431
No, the real guard will be here soon,
unless we stop it.

20:08.724 --> 20:11.044
You don't actually think
they're gonna forgive your crimes?

20:12.770 --> 20:14.438
Even if they do, then what?

20:15.189 --> 20:19.068
Guys like us, we gonna become model
citizens now? Get jobs?

20:19.693 --> 20:22.488
If we're lucky,
maybe pick up their trash.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.282
- You got a point?
- No, I got a question.

20:26.033 --> 20:29.954
They locked you up. Dumped you
down here like lab rats to die.

20:30.621 --> 20:32.790
- So why're we helping them?
- The hell we are!

20:32.957 --> 20:34.226
You're wearing those bracelets
aren't you?

20:34.250 --> 20:36.645
Right now those things are telling
them whether or not it's safe

20:36.669 --> 20:39.505
- to follow us down here.
- Okay, you said we could stop it.

20:39.588 --> 20:40.714
How?

20:41.382 --> 20:43.968
Take them off.
The Ark will think you're dead.

20:44.134 --> 20:47.638
That it's not safe to follow.
You follow?

20:49.348 --> 20:53.477
Right. And if we do, I mean,
what's in it for us?

20:54.603 --> 20:56.355
Someone's gotta help me run things.

21:01.318 --> 21:03.404
Hi, Ab.
How's the chancellor doing?

21:03.529 --> 21:05.329
Ask me again if he makes it
through the night.

21:06.323 --> 21:09.869
- Who else did we lose?
- Murphy and Mbege.

21:10.369 --> 21:12.788
- Both named John.
- Neither was injured during landing.

21:12.913 --> 21:15.332
I concur something else killed
these two.

21:15.457 --> 21:17.585
One second they were fine
and the next bang.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.587
- Then it isn't radiation.
- Come on, Abby.

21:20.212 --> 21:23.424
- Wishful thinking isn't good science.
- It's not wishful thinking.

21:23.549 --> 21:24.925
One second fine and the next bang

21:25.050 --> 21:27.636
isn't how exposure to radiation
presents.

21:28.012 --> 21:30.097
Well it could be,
if there was enough of it.

21:31.056 --> 21:33.434
If there was enough of it,
they would all be dead.

21:40.858 --> 21:42.109
Please let me be right.

21:51.035 --> 21:52.536
You know what I'd like to know?

21:52.870 --> 21:55.497
Why send us down today,
after 97 years?

21:56.206 --> 21:59.084
- What changed?
- Who cares? I'm just glad they did.

21:59.543 --> 22:03.964
I woke up rotting in a cell
and now I'm spinning in a forest.

22:04.214 --> 22:07.009
Maybe they found something on a
satellite. You know,

22:07.134 --> 22:09.637
- like an old weather satellite or...
- It wasn't a satellite.

22:10.387 --> 22:11.639
The Ark is dying.

22:14.183 --> 22:15.434
At the current population level

22:15.559 --> 22:17.412
there's roughly three months
left of life support.

22:17.436 --> 22:19.063
Maybe four, now that we're gone.

22:20.022 --> 22:22.483
So that was the secret
they locked you up to keep?

22:22.608 --> 22:25.569
Why they kept you in solitary?
Floated your old man?

22:26.820 --> 22:30.032
My father was the engineer
who discovered the flaw.

22:30.824 --> 22:32.618
He thought the people had a right
to know.

22:33.535 --> 22:36.163
The Council disagreed.
My mother disagreed.

22:36.872 --> 22:38.749
They were afraid
it would cause a panic.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.169
We were gonna go public anyway
when Wells...

22:42.920 --> 22:44.797
What?
Turned in your dad?

22:45.756 --> 22:48.217
Anyway, the Guard showed up
before we could.

22:49.385 --> 22:50.386
That's why today.

22:50.928 --> 22:52.513
That's why it was worth the risk.

22:53.055 --> 22:56.266
Even if we all die, at least they've
bought themselves some more time.

22:56.392 --> 22:58.602
They're going to kill more people,
aren't they?

23:00.020 --> 23:03.774
Good. After what they did to me,
I say float 'em all.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.484
You don't mean that.

23:08.445 --> 23:09.530
We have to warn them.

23:10.948 --> 23:12.282
That's what my father said.

23:18.330 --> 23:21.417
Oh damn.
I love Earth.

23:23.669 --> 23:26.005
Ho! Holy.

23:31.552 --> 23:33.554
Octavia, what the hell are you doing?

23:44.481 --> 23:45.482
Octavia.

23:46.859 --> 23:47.860
We can't swim.

23:48.777 --> 23:49.945
Nah, but we can stand.

23:52.322 --> 23:54.616
Wait, there's not supposed to be
a river here.

23:54.742 --> 23:57.202
Well there is.
So take off your damn clothes.

24:13.135 --> 24:14.511
Octavia, get out of the water!

24:19.933 --> 24:21.310
Get out of the water now!

24:23.645 --> 24:24.646
Octavia!

24:46.335 --> 24:47.628
What the hell is that?

24:47.753 --> 24:48.837
We have to help her.

24:48.962 --> 24:50.273
- What're you gonna do?
- Try not to get eaten.

24:50.297 --> 24:53.092
No wait. If we just distract it,
it might let her go. Help me.

25:00.557 --> 25:02.059
It worked.
It let her go.

25:02.726 --> 25:04.478
Octavia, get to the shore now!

25:09.316 --> 25:10.317
I got you.

25:12.986 --> 25:15.447
It's coming back.
It's headed right for you guys.

25:19.243 --> 25:20.869
Come on, keep moving.

25:33.090 --> 25:34.883
Thank you. Thank you.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.718
You're gonna be okay.

25:36.844 --> 25:40.264
Note to self.
Next time, save the girl.

26:14.548 --> 26:16.758
- Who's next?
- What the hell are you doing?

26:19.428 --> 26:21.930
We're liberating ourselves.
What does it look like?

26:22.055 --> 26:23.975
It looks like you're trying to
get us all killed.

26:24.892 --> 26:29.146
The communication system is dead.
These wristbands are all we've got.

26:29.271 --> 26:31.231
Take them off, and the Ark will think
we're dying.

26:31.273 --> 26:32.816
That it's not safe
for them to follow.

26:32.941 --> 26:34.985
That's the point, Chancellor.

26:35.485 --> 26:37.988
We can take care of ourselves.
Can't we?

26:38.113 --> 26:39.948
Yeah! Yeah!

26:40.073 --> 26:41.073
Think this is a game?

26:41.116 --> 26:44.369
Those aren't just our friends
and our parents up there.

26:44.828 --> 26:48.248
They're our farmers, our doctors,
our engineers.

26:48.373 --> 26:49.750
I don't care what he tells you.

26:50.459 --> 26:52.961
We won't survive here on our own.

26:55.505 --> 26:57.549
And besides, if it really is safe

26:57.674 --> 27:00.219
how could you not want the rest of
our people to come down?

27:00.344 --> 27:02.346
My people already are down.

27:02.512 --> 27:05.140
Those people locked my people up.

27:05.641 --> 27:09.853
Those people killed my mother for the
crime of having a second child.

27:11.521 --> 27:12.522
Your father did that.

27:12.856 --> 27:14.900
- My father didn't write the laws.
- No.

27:15.025 --> 27:16.318
He enforced them.

27:17.694 --> 27:20.572
But not anymore.
Not here.

27:21.281 --> 27:24.076
- Here, there are no laws.
- Yeah!

27:24.243 --> 27:28.372
Here we do whatever the hell we want,
whenever the hell we want.

27:28.956 --> 27:31.083
Now, you don't have to like it, Wells.

27:31.667 --> 27:35.545
You can even try to stop it,
change it, kill me.

27:36.463 --> 27:37.464
You know why?

27:39.549 --> 27:40.842
Whatever the hell we want.

27:40.968 --> 27:44.596
Whatever the hell we want!
Whatever the hell we want!

28:04.574 --> 28:07.661
- It's raining!
- Check it out!

28:09.079 --> 28:10.289
Water!

28:10.414 --> 28:11.456
We need to collect this.

28:12.040 --> 28:13.292
Whatever the hell you want.

28:34.896 --> 28:37.149
Ten more.
One after the next.

28:37.733 --> 28:41.945
Abby, look at plasma osmolarity.
It's going up across the board.

28:42.237 --> 28:43.405
They found water.

28:46.616 --> 28:48.618
Councilor Abigail Griffin,
you're under arrest

28:48.785 --> 28:51.705
for exceeding the maximum medical
supplies allowed per patient.

28:54.541 --> 28:55.959
Sorry this has to be public.

28:56.126 --> 28:59.963
The policy on these matters
is very clear. No special treatment.

29:01.757 --> 29:03.967
- How much blood did you use?
- Don't answer that.

29:04.134 --> 29:04.968
I used whatever it took.

29:05.135 --> 29:07.596
Breaking the law to keep you
from becoming chancellor

29:07.721 --> 29:09.639
was the easiest decision
I've ever made.

29:11.308 --> 29:12.309
In that case...

29:13.810 --> 29:17.647
...given your confession, in my role as
chancellor pro tempore,

29:17.814 --> 29:19.816
you leave me no choice
but to find you guilty.

29:19.941 --> 29:21.610
We always have a choice, Kane.

29:21.735 --> 29:24.529
You chose to press charges
against my husband,

29:24.654 --> 29:27.407
your friend, even though you knew
he would get floated for it.

29:27.532 --> 29:30.410
You chose to include my daughter
in those charges.

29:30.535 --> 29:31.995
And now you're choosing this.

29:32.662 --> 29:35.290
Hiding behind the law
absolves you of nothing.

29:35.415 --> 29:38.668
Be that as it may, in accordance with
Penal Code One...

29:40.003 --> 29:41.505
...because all crimes...

29:42.172 --> 29:45.467
committed by those above the age of
majority are capital crimes,

29:45.592 --> 29:47.677
you are hereby sentenced to death.

29:49.388 --> 29:51.139
Execution is set for the morning.

29:51.264 --> 29:56.186
And I choose,
at every turn and at any cost...

29:57.854 --> 30:00.023
...to make sure that the human race
stays alive.

30:01.441 --> 30:03.568
That's the difference between us, Kane.

30:05.445 --> 30:08.490
I choose to make sure
that we deserve to stay alive.

31:41.958 --> 31:42.959
Pretty cool, huh?

31:45.670 --> 31:46.880
Did you go to the river?

31:48.548 --> 31:50.800
Figured it was worth
losing a finger or two.

31:51.259 --> 31:52.260
Here.

31:57.557 --> 31:58.600
Call that a sip?

32:06.316 --> 32:08.735
You think this means we're all going
to grow two heads?

32:10.320 --> 32:12.155
What do you know?
She can laugh.

32:14.783 --> 32:17.118
Come on.
You have to see this.

32:29.839 --> 32:30.840
That's a toe.

32:31.841 --> 32:35.804
Plus, near as I can tell, whatever it is,
it's walking on two feet.

32:37.013 --> 32:39.849
My guess? Monkeys.

32:42.060 --> 32:46.022
I'm sorry. It's just,
according to everything I've read

32:46.189 --> 32:50.318
there are no bi-pedal animals near here.
Certainly not monkeys.

32:50.777 --> 32:53.697
Right. You read anything
about glow-in-the-dark forests

32:53.863 --> 32:55.240
or man-eating snakes?

33:14.342 --> 33:15.885
Are you out of your mind?

33:16.052 --> 33:18.305
You can't just kill everyone
who disagrees with you.

33:18.430 --> 33:20.056
I know you all think I'm a bad guy.

33:22.392 --> 33:27.022
But I'm the only one who's willing
to do what it takes to save us.

33:27.147 --> 33:28.523
She's my best friend.

33:28.648 --> 33:31.443
So what do you want me to say?
I'm sorry?

33:33.570 --> 33:36.740
I'm not. Friendship is a luxury
we can't afford.

33:36.906 --> 33:40.243
And if I have to take us down
to a cosmic Adam and Eve...

33:42.704 --> 33:43.705
...I will do it.

33:44.414 --> 33:46.708
Please, show mercy.

33:49.210 --> 33:51.421
If not for Abby, then for me.

33:52.255 --> 33:53.882
We can't afford mercy either.

34:04.809 --> 34:07.020
Sh! Sh...

34:14.610 --> 34:17.614
It's far enough.
I don't want to shoot you, Wells.

34:18.239 --> 34:20.116
Hell, I like you.

34:21.326 --> 34:23.953
But I do need them to think that
you're dead.

34:24.079 --> 34:25.789
Why? Why're you doing this?

34:25.914 --> 34:28.625
For real. Not some crap about
getting to do what you want to do.

34:29.583 --> 34:32.170
I have my reasons.
I also have the gun.

34:32.295 --> 34:35.632
So, I ask the questions.
And the question is

34:35.757 --> 34:36.925
why aren't you helping me?

34:37.425 --> 34:41.304
Your dad banished you, Wells. And yet
here you are still doing his bidding.

34:41.804 --> 34:43.139
Following the rules.

34:43.306 --> 34:45.934
Aren't you tired of always doing
what's expected of you?

34:46.351 --> 34:47.476
Stand up to him.

34:47.893 --> 34:51.231
Take off that wristband and
you'll be amazed at how good it feels.

34:51.898 --> 34:56.319
No. Never. Not gonna happen.
Is that clear enough for you?

34:59.280 --> 35:00.281
Yeah it is.

35:02.992 --> 35:04.160
Sorry it had to be this way.

35:17.298 --> 35:18.298
Get off of me!

35:18.341 --> 35:20.593
- No!
- Put it down. Put it down.

35:21.344 --> 35:22.345
No!

35:22.846 --> 35:24.097
Come on, man. Let me go.

35:24.222 --> 35:25.223
Get it. Do it.

35:25.348 --> 35:28.601
No! Don't do this!

35:28.768 --> 35:30.895
No! No! Come on!

35:46.327 --> 35:48.371
Dr. Griffin, it's time.

36:03.762 --> 36:04.763
That's enough.

36:06.139 --> 36:07.223
Watch over Clarke for me.

36:48.097 --> 36:50.016
Jackson, use the wristbands.

36:50.141 --> 36:52.936
There may be a way to reverse
engineer them for communication.

36:53.061 --> 36:55.605
Talk to Sinclair in engineering.
Nod if you understand.

37:06.074 --> 37:07.116
Stop!

37:11.746 --> 37:13.414
Dr. Griffin is pardoned.

37:21.631 --> 37:23.007
I'll deal with you later.

37:24.259 --> 37:25.260
Open the door.

37:27.053 --> 37:29.347
Open the door!

37:46.072 --> 37:49.158
I spent 12 hours putting those
intestines back together.

37:50.493 --> 37:52.287
Get him back to bed. Now.

37:55.832 --> 37:57.000
Tell me about the hundred.

37:59.836 --> 38:00.837
Did they make it?

38:04.132 --> 38:06.968
You wanted to go first.
Now quit stalling.

38:07.802 --> 38:09.137
Mount Weather awaits.

38:09.262 --> 38:11.556
Just hang on until the apogee
and you'll be fine.

38:11.681 --> 38:14.726
The Apache? Like the Indians right?

38:15.810 --> 38:17.395
Apogee, not Apache.

38:17.520 --> 38:20.607
- He knows. Today, Finn.
- Aye aye, Captain.

38:21.441 --> 38:22.692
See you on the other side.

38:24.819 --> 38:25.820
- Wait.
- What?

38:27.488 --> 38:28.489
Let me.

38:31.367 --> 38:32.368
I can do it.

38:35.872 --> 38:38.041
I knew there was a badass in there
somewhere.

38:47.842 --> 38:52.889
Hey, it's okay to be afraid, Jasper.
The trick is not fighting it.

38:59.604 --> 39:00.855
See you on the other side.

39:07.487 --> 39:09.155
Whoo! Whoo!

39:11.574 --> 39:13.117
Oh...

39:23.127 --> 39:25.254
We are Apogee!

39:33.680 --> 39:34.847
You did it, Jasper!

39:34.931 --> 39:37.183
Whoo! Yeah!

39:40.979 --> 39:42.355
Let's go, princess.

39:43.731 --> 39:44.732
You're up.

39:47.735 --> 39:52.740
Come on, Clarke. You've got this.
Whoo! Apogee!

40:04.293 --> 40:05.294
We did it.

40:07.213 --> 40:08.548
Mount Weather!

40:09.549 --> 40:12.176
Whoo!

40:12.468 --> 40:13.469
Yes!

40:14.053 --> 40:15.847
Whoo!

40:20.309 --> 40:22.603
Jasper, Jasper!

40:22.770 --> 40:25.440
Jasper!

40:25.773 --> 40:27.817
- Jasper!
- Come on!

40:27.984 --> 40:29.360
- Move it!
- Get down, get down.

40:39.620 --> 40:40.788
We're not alone.
