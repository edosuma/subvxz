WEBVTT

00:00.515 --> 00:03.196
Hey, you guys see the dude
I brought in today...

00:03.197 --> 00:05.594
The drug dealer?
81 years old.

00:05.595 --> 00:08.235
I think it's the oldest collar
of my entire career.

00:08.236 --> 00:11.494
I once arrested a 96-year-old
for flashing.

00:11.495 --> 00:13.459
I was terrified he'd die
in my backseat...

00:13.460 --> 00:14.854
Or flash me.

00:14.855 --> 00:18.191
My oldest collar was 78,
but the PCP

00:18.192 --> 00:19.525
made her fight
like she was 20.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.060
What about two
50-year-old twins?

00:21.061 --> 00:22.395
Does that count
as a 100-year-old?

00:22.396 --> 00:23.398
- No good.
- No.

00:23.399 --> 00:26.312
You talking oldest bags?
68.

00:26.313 --> 00:28.366
That's not that old.
Yeah, but I was only 20.

00:28.367 --> 00:30.048
20? Were you even
a cop then?

00:30.049 --> 00:33.155
No, man, it was before
I got into the academy.

00:33.156 --> 00:37.665
Charles isn't talking
about his oldest arrest.

00:37.666 --> 00:38.699
Ew!

00:38.700 --> 00:39.734
No... yes, I am.

00:39.735 --> 00:41.536
Yeah, oldest arrest...
68, like I said.

00:41.537 --> 00:43.538
God, you had sex
with a 68-year-old

00:43.539 --> 00:44.906
when you were in your 20s?

00:44.907 --> 00:46.208
You know how it is.

00:46.209 --> 00:48.245
When you have a chance
to bed an older woman, you...

00:48.246 --> 00:51.246
No, that is not an older woman.
That's an old woman!

00:51.247 --> 00:52.647
That's someone's grandma!

00:52.648 --> 00:54.216
She was, actually.
That's how I met her.

00:54.217 --> 00:56.187
Went to college
with her grandson Marvin.

00:56.188 --> 00:58.090
Don't... don't knock it
till you try it.

00:58.091 --> 01:00.326
She had a replacement hip
with some serious torque.

01:00.327 --> 01:02.696
It was like having sex
with a transformer.

01:02.697 --> 01:04.897
No.
That is no one's fantasy.

01:24.870 --> 01:26.871
Peralta...

01:26.872 --> 01:28.706
Where are we
on the Lincoln place murder?

01:28.740 --> 01:31.374
Well, like I told Captain Holt
earlier this week,

01:31.375 --> 01:33.709
we are at the one-yard line.
It's a football reference.

01:33.743 --> 01:36.344
Yes, Jake.
I played linebacker at Syracuse.

01:36.378 --> 01:39.146
Really? In High School,
I played center field

01:39.147 --> 01:40.680
in the musical damn Yankees.

01:40.714 --> 01:42.181
Yeah, you don't want
to brag about that.

01:42.182 --> 01:44.216
Peralta, you want
to loop everyone in?

01:44.250 --> 01:46.519
- Ehh...
- That was not a request.

01:46.554 --> 01:48.556
Fine.

01:48.590 --> 01:51.159
Get ready for some stuff
on a screen.

01:51.193 --> 01:53.528
Meet Fred Gorman...

01:53.529 --> 01:56.863
Prominent citizen,
lawyer, corpse.

01:56.864 --> 01:59.198
Now meet his wife,
Ann Hoert.

01:59.199 --> 02:01.000
She did not take
his last name,

02:01.001 --> 02:03.036
but I believe she did
take his life.

02:03.071 --> 02:04.670
- Nice.
- Thank you, Charles.

02:04.671 --> 02:07.506
Now, Hoert had means,
motives, and opportunity.

02:07.507 --> 02:09.208
I just need to find
the murder weapon.

02:09.209 --> 02:11.343
For some reason, the D.A. won't
move forward with the arrest

02:11.344 --> 02:12.710
until we find the knife
she used.

02:12.744 --> 02:14.845
Is that reason that they want
to win the case?

02:14.846 --> 02:15.879
Yes.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.514
Well, find it.

02:17.515 --> 02:18.848
The family's close
to the mayor,

02:18.849 --> 02:20.551
and I'm catching heat
from the higher-ups.

02:20.552 --> 02:21.818
I'm gonna ask you again.

02:21.819 --> 02:24.053
Do you need any resources
or personnel?

02:24.088 --> 02:25.721
No, sir, I've got it.

02:25.756 --> 02:27.122
Okay.

02:27.123 --> 02:28.857
Dismissed!

02:28.858 --> 02:30.225
Sergeant Jeffords,
my office.

02:30.226 --> 02:31.459
Uh-oh.

02:31.460 --> 02:33.060
He probably wants
to talk to you

02:33.061 --> 02:35.061
about how your shirts aren't
tight enough probably.

02:37.231 --> 02:39.265
Okay, how can we help?
What do you need?

02:39.299 --> 02:40.533
I need nothing.

02:40.534 --> 02:43.235
I'm about to solve this case,
meet the mayor,

02:43.236 --> 02:44.903
and sell my life rights
to Channing Tatum

02:44.904 --> 02:46.304
so he can play
my less attractive brother

02:46.305 --> 02:47.538
in the ensuing film.

02:47.573 --> 02:50.207
- Come on, Peralta,
- Holt said to use the whole team.

02:50.208 --> 02:51.441
We all want this solved.

02:51.442 --> 02:55.044
I appreciate the offer,
but I work best alone...

02:55.045 --> 02:56.846
Except when it comes
to sex.

02:56.847 --> 02:59.215
Actually,
sometimes including sex.

02:59.216 --> 03:00.716
Will you just let us help?

03:00.750 --> 03:01.950
Okay, fine.

03:01.951 --> 03:04.651
I will let one
of you help me... Charles.

03:04.686 --> 03:06.186
Yeah!

03:06.220 --> 03:07.987
And I am choosing Charles
because he's the least likely

03:07.988 --> 03:09.355
to steal my thunder.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.324
I would never steal
his thunder.

03:11.325 --> 03:14.159
I-I'd be afraid to borrow it.

03:14.160 --> 03:18.028
Terry, I'd like you
to accompany me to a gun range.

03:18.029 --> 03:20.197
You mean drive you there
and wait outside...

03:20.198 --> 03:21.764
Far away from the guns.

03:21.765 --> 03:24.233
I spent eight years
in the public affairs office,

03:24.234 --> 03:25.867
so my tactical skills
are a little rusty.

03:25.868 --> 03:27.302
I need some pointers.

03:27.303 --> 03:30.137
Sir, I haven't fired a weapon
since the incident.

03:30.138 --> 03:32.972
The mannequin incident...
I'm familiar.

03:39.512 --> 03:42.780
Actually, there was an incident
after that.

03:42.781 --> 03:43.914
Another incident?

03:47.584 --> 03:51.086
You got to cool it, man.

03:51.087 --> 03:52.754
I'm gonna get some candy.

03:52.755 --> 03:55.355
Sir, I may not be the man
for the job.

03:55.390 --> 03:57.490
You used to be the precinct's
champion marksman.

03:57.525 --> 03:59.158
I only want to take pointers
from the best.

03:59.193 --> 04:01.060
So I'll keep it low-key.

04:01.061 --> 04:03.028
We'll go after work
to a private range.

04:03.029 --> 04:04.629
No cops, no pressure.

04:04.630 --> 04:06.931
Blam! Blam, blam!

04:06.932 --> 04:08.499
Gun range.

04:08.533 --> 04:10.968
I told Gina she could join us.
I want to get certified.

04:10.969 --> 04:13.002
There has been a ton of crime
in my neighborhood,

04:13.003 --> 04:15.671
and the cops in my precinct
are very bad.

04:15.705 --> 04:17.272
You live in our precinct.

04:17.307 --> 04:20.007
Yeah, I know.

04:20.041 --> 04:22.142
I know we've
gone over this before,

04:22.177 --> 04:23.910
but I have to ask you again.

04:23.911 --> 04:26.045
Is there anywhere
you can think of in that hallway

04:26.046 --> 04:27.479
where a knife
could be hidden?

04:27.513 --> 04:30.715
Well, since I've already
told you, like, three times, no,

04:30.716 --> 04:32.349
why don't I just record it?

04:32.350 --> 04:33.850
Then I don't have
to say it again.

04:33.884 --> 04:37.319
The hallway,
like all other hallways,

04:37.353 --> 04:40.154
does not have
a secret knife-hiding place.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.056
All right,
you want to hear it again?

04:42.057 --> 04:43.724
Idea for a novel...

04:43.725 --> 04:46.058
A mild-mannered doorman
gets bitten on the penis

04:46.093 --> 04:47.693
by a radioactive spider

04:47.727 --> 04:50.261
and becomes the world's
greatest lover.

04:50.296 --> 04:51.796
No, don't stop it.
I want to hear what happens.

04:51.797 --> 04:53.097
This is terrific.

04:53.098 --> 04:54.698
He saves the first lady,
if you must know.

04:54.699 --> 04:57.099
Sounds compelling.

05:00.203 --> 05:01.202
Oh, boy.

05:01.203 --> 05:02.837
Well, hello.

05:02.871 --> 05:05.438
I heard you guys
were making the rounds again.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.039
All right.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.142
- This one's all you, tiger.
- Come on!

05:11.478 --> 05:13.688
Police!

05:13.714 --> 05:15.348
Hey, ma'am.

05:15.382 --> 05:16.949
Thank God!
Here, hold this.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.885
The lasagna's burning.
Okay.

05:19.886 --> 05:22.153
Get the dog, but don't
let it touch the baby!

05:23.755 --> 05:26.826
Oh. Okay.
Peralta.

05:26.858 --> 05:29.560
Yo, I looked at the photos
of your victim on your desk.

05:29.594 --> 05:31.328
Is that Rosa?
Tell her I said hi.

05:31.363 --> 05:32.663
The puncture wounds
are similar

05:32.664 --> 05:34.131
to a case
I had a while back.

05:34.132 --> 05:35.533
They aren't from a knife.

05:35.534 --> 05:36.767
I think it's something spiral,
like a corkscrew.

05:36.802 --> 05:37.801
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

05:37.836 --> 05:39.536
Don't shush me.
I'm helping you.

05:39.570 --> 05:40.904
No, no,
I'm holding a baby.

05:40.905 --> 05:42.605
That was actually very helpful,
thank you.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.842
Uh-oh.
You better get back here. Now.

05:52.515 --> 05:56.356
Oh!
Hello, Peralta.

05:57.921 --> 05:59.359
No, no, no!

05:59.388 --> 06:00.922
I don't know why
you're so upset, man.

06:00.923 --> 06:03.424
I'm the one who had to come
to this backwater stink hole.

06:03.425 --> 06:04.572
What's up, little man?

06:04.593 --> 06:06.761
What's up?
Feeling sexy? Huh?

06:06.762 --> 06:08.096
Yeah, I feel sexy.

06:08.097 --> 06:09.464
Yeah, you look sexy, man.
You know I do.

06:09.465 --> 06:11.500
Watch out for that door.

06:12.836 --> 06:14.769
Yo, how much you bench,
seriously?

06:14.803 --> 06:16.938
Captain, please, please,
pretty please

06:16.939 --> 06:18.545
do not let him take over
my case.

06:18.573 --> 06:20.908
Major crimes is stepping in.
Nothing I can do.

06:20.909 --> 06:22.042
You're off the case.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.410
I can't believe
you're just rolling over

06:23.411 --> 06:25.412
and giving my murder away
to the vulture.

06:25.413 --> 06:26.947
We call him the vulture
because he swoops in

06:26.948 --> 06:28.516
and solves cases
that are almost solved

06:28.517 --> 06:30.017
and takes the credit
for himself.

06:30.052 --> 06:32.600
Yes, Boyle, I put that together
from context.

06:32.621 --> 06:35.270
First of all,
major crimes has jurisdiction

06:35.290 --> 06:36.524
over any and all cases
they want to take.

06:36.525 --> 06:37.992
But more importantly,

06:37.993 --> 06:40.161
you're the one who insisted
on working alone.

06:40.162 --> 06:42.330
I told you for weeks
to use the squad,

06:42.331 --> 06:43.498
and you refused.

06:43.532 --> 06:44.966
I used them.

06:44.967 --> 06:47.035
I mean, Rosa's the one
who figured out the corkscrew.

06:47.036 --> 06:49.504
And Charles caught a dog.

06:49.538 --> 06:52.007
Oh, congratulations,
Detective Boyle.

06:52.041 --> 06:53.475
You should've
involved him sooner.

06:53.476 --> 06:55.343
Turn over your files
to Detective Pembroke.

06:55.378 --> 06:56.845
Sir, call him the vulture.

06:56.846 --> 06:58.213
Giving him a name
makes him human.

06:58.247 --> 07:01.182
Turn over the files.

07:01.216 --> 07:02.283
Fine.

07:02.284 --> 07:03.518
But in protest,

07:03.519 --> 07:06.588
I'm walking over there
extremely slowly.

07:12.828 --> 07:14.329
Thank you.

07:17.166 --> 07:18.400
God! This is so boring!

07:18.434 --> 07:20.102
For both of us.

07:20.103 --> 07:21.703
You know,
before I solve this case,

07:21.704 --> 07:24.406
I'd like to thank you for doing
all the super-easy work,

07:24.440 --> 07:26.541
you know, the real
Nancy drew-level stuff.

07:26.576 --> 07:28.948
Oh, yeah? Did Nancy drew solve
a lot of murders?

07:28.978 --> 07:30.946
Yeah, she did...
Murder on ice,

07:30.947 --> 07:32.147
recipe for murder.

07:32.148 --> 07:33.715
Nancy was
a wonderful Detective.

07:33.716 --> 07:34.883
I wanted to be her
when I grew up.

07:34.917 --> 07:37.185
Thanks, Charles.
That's helpful.

07:37.186 --> 07:40.521
Hey! Should we take odds on
how fast I'll solve this case?

07:40.556 --> 07:42.957
- Nope.
- I mean, what was it with Diaz's last

07:42.958 --> 07:44.259
"impossible" extortion case?

07:44.260 --> 07:46.394
What was it, six hours?

07:46.395 --> 07:48.396
That's because
it was 98% solved.

07:48.431 --> 07:51.099
The last 2%
is the hardest to get.

07:51.100 --> 07:52.934
That's why they leave it
in the milk.

07:52.969 --> 07:54.236
What?

07:54.237 --> 07:55.403
Oh! Wow!

07:55.438 --> 07:57.205
Looking good, Santiago.

07:57.206 --> 07:58.840
You foxy ma.

07:58.875 --> 08:00.309
Go rot in hell.

08:00.310 --> 08:01.877
This is your fault.

08:03.346 --> 08:05.413
Thanks, champ.
Good effort.

08:05.414 --> 08:07.082
I got it from here.

08:07.083 --> 08:08.750
And, hey,
you feel free to call me

08:08.751 --> 08:10.418
anytime you need me
to come down here

08:10.419 --> 08:12.742
and help powder
that big white ass of yours.

08:14.357 --> 08:17.657
Well, that's the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

08:19.145 --> 08:21.247
I hate the vulture so much!

08:21.248 --> 08:24.517
Me too.
But he's kind of hot.

08:24.551 --> 08:25.918
What?

08:25.919 --> 08:27.453
You can hate people
and still think they're hot.

08:27.454 --> 08:28.988
Case in point,
Manuel Noriega.

08:29.022 --> 08:31.557
You know what?
I'm with you on this.

08:31.558 --> 08:32.722
Tonya Harding.

08:32.722 --> 08:34.993
- Yeah, she's thick.
- Right?

08:34.994 --> 08:36.962
- Always classy, Jake.
- Mm-hmm.

08:36.996 --> 08:38.996
Sorry you got vultured.

08:38.998 --> 08:40.198
Happens to the best of us.

08:40.198 --> 08:41.500
On my count.

08:41.534 --> 08:43.356
One, two...

08:43.369 --> 08:45.470
Three!
I got it from here!

08:45.471 --> 08:46.705
Yeah!

08:46.706 --> 08:48.573
Get up! Get up!
Turn around!

08:49.809 --> 08:51.209
You have the right
to remain silent.

08:51.210 --> 08:52.511
Anything you say...

08:52.512 --> 08:54.713
Can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

08:54.714 --> 08:55.914
Thanks, guys,
I got it from here.

08:55.915 --> 08:57.416
Let's go.
Beat it!

08:57.417 --> 08:59.484
Skim white chocolate macchiato
for Charles.

08:59.485 --> 09:00.919
I got it from here.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.121
I used a gift card
for that!

09:03.122 --> 09:05.857
God, I just... I want to get
back at him so bad!

09:05.858 --> 09:08.160
I wish I could throw
his cell phone in the toilet

09:08.161 --> 09:10.662
or slash his tires...
I don't know.

09:10.697 --> 09:12.197
Or slash
his gorgeous throat.

09:12.232 --> 09:14.366
I cannot figure you out.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.901
Okay, I'm buying
everyone drinks

09:15.902 --> 09:18.036
as long as we're here
thinking of a revenge plan.

09:18.037 --> 09:20.104
Best idea gets 50 bucks.

09:20.105 --> 09:21.406
Throw 'em on out.

09:21.440 --> 09:22.840
What if you called him
from a hospital

09:22.841 --> 09:24.709
and said his whole family
is dead?

09:24.710 --> 09:26.377
Like, they died
of cancer.

09:26.378 --> 09:28.446
Charles, that is so dark.

09:28.447 --> 09:29.780
I'm putting it down.

09:29.781 --> 09:32.150
So my stance feels good,

09:32.151 --> 09:34.585
- but I'm still not hitting center.
- All right.

09:34.620 --> 09:36.654
Back your left foot up
a hair.

09:36.655 --> 09:37.988
Like this?

09:37.989 --> 09:39.056
Mm, mm, mm!

09:39.057 --> 09:40.791
No! Gina!
We've been over this.

09:40.792 --> 09:42.426
Well, show me!

09:42.427 --> 09:46.497
Like, wrap your thick,
muscular arms around me and...

09:46.498 --> 09:47.598
All right, look,

09:47.599 --> 09:50.267
hands here, stand up straight,
chin forward.

09:50.268 --> 09:51.569
Hold on, my nose itches.

09:51.570 --> 09:53.003
Gina!

09:53.004 --> 09:55.439
When I lock my shooting arm,
the other hand feels unstable.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.141
Now, what stance
am I supposed to be doing...

09:57.142 --> 09:58.509
Weaver or isosceles?

09:58.510 --> 10:00.244
You guys did stances?
Like, I'll be like...

10:00.245 --> 10:01.379
Yeah, everybody
does stances, Gina.

10:01.380 --> 10:03.380
Listen, uh...
Hey, all right, all right!

10:03.381 --> 10:05.949
Look, hey, both you,
just watch.

10:08.253 --> 10:10.287
That's eight!
He did it!

10:10.288 --> 10:13.490
That was only seven.

10:13.491 --> 10:15.993
Why are you counting
my shots?

10:15.994 --> 10:17.794
Are you trying
to have me recertified?

10:17.795 --> 10:19.429
Yes.

10:19.430 --> 10:21.064
If you make eight
of ten shots,

10:21.065 --> 10:23.066
I can sign off on
you carrying a gun again.

10:23.067 --> 10:24.601
Gina's here
as an official witness,

10:24.602 --> 10:25.802
and I thought
it'd be easier for you

10:25.803 --> 10:26.937
in a no-pressure
environment.

10:26.938 --> 10:29.106
I can't believe
you tricked me!

10:29.107 --> 10:31.241
You're too good a cop
to be shackled to a desk.

10:31.242 --> 10:35.111
You only have one hit
until you get recertified.

10:35.112 --> 10:38.315
So deep breath, huh?

10:38.316 --> 10:41.418
Take the final shot.

10:41.419 --> 10:44.521
Don't overthink it.

10:44.522 --> 10:47.258
Just relax and breathe.

10:47.259 --> 10:49.693
Bring air into your lungs...

10:49.694 --> 10:51.862
Like you've done
your whole life.

10:53.360 --> 10:55.398
Oh, my God.

10:55.399 --> 10:58.134
Guys!
How do you breathe?

10:58.169 --> 10:59.769
I forgot how to breathe!

10:59.804 --> 11:03.239
Is it two in, one out?

11:03.274 --> 11:05.676
What if we wrap his motorcycle
in plastic wrap

11:05.677 --> 11:07.744
and melt it
with a hair dryer?

11:07.745 --> 11:10.414
Little trick I learned
in gift basket making class.

11:10.448 --> 11:12.582
All right.
Here's what we're up to.

11:12.617 --> 11:15.819
Steal his kidney,
burn down his house,

11:15.820 --> 11:18.054
replace his aloe tissues
with regular tissues.

11:18.055 --> 11:19.389
Thank you, Charles.
You're welcome.

11:19.390 --> 11:21.424
Leave a dead cat
in his cedar closet.

11:21.425 --> 11:24.094
He would have
to own a cedar closet.

11:24.128 --> 11:26.096
He seems like he would.

11:26.130 --> 11:28.432
Sneak into his apartment and
burn popcorn in the microwave.

11:28.433 --> 11:30.801
Thank you, Charles.

11:30.802 --> 11:32.603
Uh, Scully asked
for mashed potatoes,

11:32.604 --> 11:33.771
so I wrote that down.

11:33.839 --> 11:36.040
Well, I hate to say it,
but I think, by default,

11:36.041 --> 11:38.308
Charles' motorcycle idea
is the winner.

11:38.309 --> 11:40.711
Yeah!
Winning by default.

11:40.745 --> 11:42.012
Let's get into it.

11:42.013 --> 11:43.680
Anybody know
where the vulture lives?

11:43.681 --> 11:46.049
On third, right near here.
How do you know that?

11:46.083 --> 11:47.917
Chug 'em, boys.
We're rolling!

11:48.952 --> 11:50.286
Yes!

11:50.320 --> 11:51.487
Take that, vulture!

11:51.522 --> 11:53.022
- Yeah.
- Nice.

11:53.023 --> 11:54.690
All right,
give me your hair dryer.

11:54.724 --> 11:56.325
What?
What are you talking about?

11:56.326 --> 11:57.794
Don't you carry one
in your purse?

11:57.795 --> 12:00.329
Have you ever met
a human woman?

12:00.330 --> 12:02.398
There's a drugstore
four blocks away... I'm on it.

12:02.399 --> 12:03.866
Oh, no.

12:03.934 --> 12:06.069
Scully traveling
four blocks?

12:06.070 --> 12:08.104
That could take weeks.

12:09.106 --> 12:10.540
Hoo!

12:10.541 --> 12:11.841
Take the shot, sergeant.

12:11.842 --> 12:13.276
I just need a second.

12:13.277 --> 12:15.511
You've had 18 minutes
of seconds.

12:18.815 --> 12:20.783
Gina's authentic
stolen police badges.

12:20.784 --> 12:22.152
How can I help?

12:22.153 --> 12:23.987
- Hey, it's Peralta.
- Oh, hey, Jake.

12:23.988 --> 12:25.989
Hey, do you carry
a hair dryer in your purse?

12:26.023 --> 12:27.824
Of course.
I'm not an animal.

12:27.858 --> 12:29.959
Great.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.361
I need you to bring it
to the vulture's apartment.

12:31.395 --> 12:32.729
There's someone named
"the vulture"?

12:32.763 --> 12:34.831
Tell Rosa.
She'd be into that.

12:34.832 --> 12:36.199
Come on!

12:36.200 --> 12:38.435
Peralta, why are you asking Gina
about Detective Pembroke?

12:38.469 --> 12:40.170
Oh, Captain, hello.

12:40.171 --> 12:43.840
Uh, we are preparing him
a gift basket of sorts.

12:43.841 --> 12:45.609
Look,
I understand that you're upset.

12:45.643 --> 12:47.611
But if you want to keep this
from happening again,

12:47.612 --> 12:49.746
I suggest that you pull
your team together

12:49.747 --> 12:53.483
and solve these cases before
major crimes can step in.

12:53.484 --> 12:54.951
Am I clear?

12:54.986 --> 12:58.088
Yes, sir.
That is definitely clear.

12:58.089 --> 13:00.658
Thank you, sir.

13:01.793 --> 13:02.893
You should be frowning.

13:02.928 --> 13:05.429
Why is Jake smi...
Why are you smiling?

13:05.430 --> 13:08.332
Because the Captain just gave us
the perfect revenge plan.

13:08.333 --> 13:11.301
We team up
and solve this case right now!

13:11.302 --> 13:12.869
That is not what he meant.

13:12.904 --> 13:14.438
Think about it, Amy.

13:14.439 --> 13:15.772
We go back to the scene
of the crime,

13:15.773 --> 13:17.941
find the murder weapon,
and out-vulture the vulture!

13:17.976 --> 13:20.177
No one gets in trouble
if we crack the case.

13:20.178 --> 13:22.176
Okay, screw it.
I'm in.

13:22.180 --> 13:24.014
Yes! That's right!
All right.

13:24.015 --> 13:25.972
We're angry.
We're getting revenge.

13:25.984 --> 13:27.318
We're a little bit tipsy.

13:27.319 --> 13:29.058
We should not be driving.
We're taking the bus.

13:29.087 --> 13:31.366
I love the bus!

13:34.871 --> 13:37.540
So the waitress heard
the couple arguing at dinner.

13:37.541 --> 13:39.041
Apparently he was having
an affair,

13:39.042 --> 13:41.010
and it was not
the first time.

13:41.011 --> 13:43.446
Two years ago, she caught him
with a dog Walker

13:43.447 --> 13:46.482
who was walking his dog,
if you know what I mean.

13:46.517 --> 13:47.617
- I do.
- Right?

13:47.618 --> 13:48.951
- Yes, I got it.
- Sex times.

13:48.952 --> 13:51.187
- Mm-hmm.
- Anyways, we know it's the wife.

13:51.221 --> 13:53.656
You're real talkative
now that you want our help.

13:53.690 --> 13:56.292
All right,
it is possible

13:56.293 --> 13:58.561
that I should've brought
you guys in sooner.

13:58.562 --> 14:00.229
But I just get so excited,

14:00.230 --> 14:02.164
wrapped up in wanting
to solve stuff, you know?

14:02.165 --> 14:04.266
I get it.
You want to be the best.

14:04.267 --> 14:06.202
We all do.

14:06.203 --> 14:10.239
You just don't have to be
such a butthead about it.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.423
What?

14:11.424 --> 14:13.042
I just can't believe
you would call me a butthead.

14:13.043 --> 14:14.611
- Shut up.
- That's so harsh.

14:17.949 --> 14:22.051
Hitchcock farts nonstop.

14:22.052 --> 14:24.120
Still waiting, sergeant.

14:24.121 --> 14:26.856
It's just the target looks
exactly like a friend of mine.

14:26.857 --> 14:28.190
It's just freaking me out.

14:28.224 --> 14:30.025
You have a friend...

14:30.060 --> 14:31.861
- Who's just a silhouette?
- Yes.

14:31.895 --> 14:33.897
Let's all just count
to a million.

14:33.898 --> 14:35.365
One, two, three, four,
five, six...

14:35.399 --> 14:38.635
So then iceman says,
"you can be my wingman any day."

14:38.636 --> 14:41.238
And then Maverick says...
I've seen the film, sergeant.

14:41.239 --> 14:42.939
I haven't.
What happens next?

14:42.940 --> 14:45.275
Goose comes back, right?
He's not really dead.

14:46.744 --> 14:48.445
Goose is gone.

14:48.479 --> 14:49.846
- No!
- I know!

14:49.880 --> 14:51.615
All right,
here's how it went down.

14:51.649 --> 14:54.017
9:45, a man screams.

14:54.052 --> 14:56.687
90 seconds later,
wife goes down to the doorman,

14:56.688 --> 14:59.489
says a guy murdered her husband
and then ran off.

14:59.490 --> 15:01.124
We know she's lying.

15:01.125 --> 15:02.592
We've just got to
find the corkscrew

15:02.627 --> 15:04.094
to make our case airtight.

15:04.128 --> 15:06.630
I say we role-play,
see if something sparks.

15:06.664 --> 15:08.465
Darling, thank you
for a lovely dinner.

15:08.466 --> 15:10.968
Perhaps we should have
one more drink before bed.

15:10.969 --> 15:13.370
Don't you
"darling" me, you philanderer.

15:13.371 --> 15:15.839
No, you're the husband.
The husband had the affair.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.407
I'm always the victim.
I don't want to be the victim.

15:17.442 --> 15:18.976
Okay, Charles is the door.

15:19.010 --> 15:20.944
No. I'll be the victim.
Don't make me a door again.

15:20.978 --> 15:23.646
Great. Okay, so...
Wife goes into the drawer.

15:23.647 --> 15:27.216
Gets the corkscrew.
Stab, stab, stab.

15:27.251 --> 15:28.785
What did she do
with the corkscrew?

15:28.786 --> 15:30.119
She dumps it
in the hallway trash chute

15:30.120 --> 15:31.320
on the way to the doorman.

15:31.355 --> 15:32.955
No, we checked the trash,
like, ten times.

15:32.956 --> 15:34.624
We would've seen
a bloody corkscrew.

15:34.658 --> 15:36.392
All right, Hitchcock,
you're up.

15:38.963 --> 15:40.930
The body.

15:40.931 --> 15:43.233
The corkscrew's
still in the body.

15:43.267 --> 15:44.968
No, you're terrible at this.
Go sit down.

15:45.002 --> 15:46.269
You're up, Diaz.

15:46.303 --> 15:48.237
Stab!

15:48.238 --> 15:49.939
Then I...

15:49.940 --> 15:51.341
Toss the corkscrew
out the window,

15:51.342 --> 15:52.642
and it lands
on a passing car.

15:52.677 --> 15:54.945
Security cam showed
no one driving by at that time

15:54.946 --> 15:56.246
and nothing on the street.

15:56.280 --> 15:59.282
Okay, I want in.
But I only want to stab you.

15:59.283 --> 16:01.584
Fine.
Charles, door.

16:01.619 --> 16:03.186
Right.

16:04.889 --> 16:07.190
Okay, uh, sweetheart.

16:07.224 --> 16:08.291
Time to die.

16:08.292 --> 16:10.126
That seems a little harsh.

16:10.161 --> 16:12.962
What if it was
a magnetic corkscrew?

16:14.231 --> 16:16.599
If the corkscrew was
on a magnet...

16:16.633 --> 16:18.567
It's stuck halfway down
the inside of the trash chute.

16:18.568 --> 16:19.902
I figured it out first!

16:19.903 --> 16:21.070
Wow!

16:21.071 --> 16:22.538
What's happening?

16:22.539 --> 16:24.407
You have a ten-pound flashlight
in your purse,

16:24.408 --> 16:26.876
but not a hair dryer?

16:26.877 --> 16:28.712
I can't see
far enough down.

16:28.713 --> 16:30.180
Someone's gonna have to go
down in there.

16:30.181 --> 16:32.648
Someone
with narrow shoulders.

16:32.649 --> 16:34.183
No! I have
broad shoulders.

16:34.184 --> 16:37.853
I have narrow hips,
but broad shoulders.

16:37.888 --> 16:39.856
God!

16:39.890 --> 16:41.157
See anything?

16:41.158 --> 16:42.859
A little lower.

16:42.894 --> 16:45.228
Freeze!
Hands in the air!

16:45.229 --> 16:46.496
Ahh!

16:46.497 --> 16:48.231
We're cops.
Broad shoulders!

16:48.265 --> 16:51.267
Stuck! Told you...
Broad shoulders.

16:51.268 --> 16:54.003
Apparently, our Detective squad
has gotten drunk,

16:54.004 --> 16:55.471
compromised the crime scene,

16:55.472 --> 16:58.007
and an officer has gotten stuck
in a trash chute.

16:58.041 --> 17:00.309
I need you to lead
this squad, Terry.

17:00.344 --> 17:01.577
And I mean really lead it.

17:04.448 --> 17:06.715
I hope you take the shot.

17:06.751 --> 17:08.818
What kind of
precinct are you running here?

17:08.852 --> 17:10.118
Would you like to sit down,
Detective?

17:10.119 --> 17:12.121
You seem upset.
Hell yeah, I'm upset.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.590
Your team disrupted
a crime scene

17:14.592 --> 17:18.228
over which they have zero...
Zero jurisdiction.

17:18.262 --> 17:19.496
They were publicly drunk.

17:19.530 --> 17:21.097
Apparently
one of them pressed

17:21.098 --> 17:23.366
all the buttons
on the elevator.

17:23.367 --> 17:25.068
Only, maybe he just bumped up
against the panel

17:25.069 --> 17:26.202
with that big white ass
of his.

17:26.236 --> 17:28.570
What now?
Holt is gonna kill you.

17:28.606 --> 17:29.906
I don't think he will...

17:29.940 --> 17:31.341
Because...

17:31.375 --> 17:32.942
Voila!

17:32.977 --> 17:34.778
You actually found the corkscrew
in the trash chute?

17:34.812 --> 17:37.480
Stuck to the side,
just like you said.

17:37.515 --> 17:40.550
Boyle, we're pulling you out!

17:45.423 --> 17:47.925
This is the proudest moment
of my career.

17:47.926 --> 17:49.226
Ah!

17:49.260 --> 17:52.563
Oh, my God, you guys,
we out-vultured the vulture!

17:54.432 --> 17:55.433
What the hell was that?

17:55.467 --> 17:56.867
What? It's a vulture.

17:56.902 --> 17:58.936
Now, if you'll excuse me,

17:58.937 --> 18:01.306
I'm gonna take this corkscrew
over to the D.A.

18:01.307 --> 18:03.942
So we get the collar,
not major crimes.

18:03.943 --> 18:06.511
Peralta!
Now.

18:08.914 --> 18:10.582
Okay.

18:10.583 --> 18:12.250
- Before you get mad...
- Shut it!

18:12.251 --> 18:13.318
Holt was right.

18:13.352 --> 18:14.585
I've been so worried
about my own kids,

18:14.586 --> 18:16.621
I forgot about
my stupid grown-up kids.

18:16.655 --> 18:18.122
That's insulting.

18:18.157 --> 18:19.657
I should've been
on you guys more.

18:19.658 --> 18:22.360
And starting now,
I will be.

18:22.361 --> 18:24.729
But if you ever
do this again,

18:24.730 --> 18:27.466
I swear I will crush your head
in one hand.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.134
- You don't mean that.
- Try me.

18:29.168 --> 18:30.769
Okay.

18:32.171 --> 18:33.939
Where you going?

18:33.973 --> 18:35.307
The boss is taking heat

18:35.308 --> 18:37.075
for something
that's not even his fault.

18:37.076 --> 18:38.777
I can't let that happen.

18:38.778 --> 18:41.279
Wait.
Damn it.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.915
Look, it's not
your fault either.

18:43.916 --> 18:48.086
And it's not
the vulture's fault.

18:48.087 --> 18:49.354
It's Amy's.

18:49.355 --> 18:50.722
I know. I know.
It's mine.

18:50.723 --> 18:52.324
It's mine, okay?

18:52.325 --> 18:54.926
God, I do not love
how this worked out.

18:56.696 --> 18:58.497
Detective Pembroke.

18:58.531 --> 18:59.831
Now what?

18:59.832 --> 19:01.633
I'd like to cordially invite you
to calm down,

19:01.634 --> 19:03.235
especially considering
that this case

19:03.236 --> 19:04.804
has already been solved...

19:04.805 --> 19:06.172
By you!

19:07.574 --> 19:09.094
Looks like you found
the murder weapon.

19:09.109 --> 19:11.544
It's a good thing you realized
it was magnetically stuck

19:11.545 --> 19:12.912
to the inside
of the trash chute.

19:12.913 --> 19:14.880
Congratulations.

19:16.683 --> 19:18.250
Cracked the case
all by yourself.

19:18.251 --> 19:19.585
We done here?

19:22.790 --> 19:25.091
Yeah.
Yeah, we're done here.

19:26.260 --> 19:27.961
Hey, keep up
the bad work, champ.

19:27.962 --> 19:30.964
Here it comes.

19:30.965 --> 19:33.181
Why does he keep
touching my butt?

19:34.904 --> 19:37.339
- Stay foxy.
- Die lonely.

19:37.373 --> 19:40.075
Well, case closed.
Good work, everyone.

19:40.076 --> 19:42.410
Let's, uh, call it a night
without any further discussion.

19:42.411 --> 19:43.845
No!

19:43.846 --> 19:45.380
All of you broke
into a crime scene

19:45.414 --> 19:47.015
under the influence
of alcohol,

19:47.016 --> 19:49.851
overstepped your jurisdiction,
and disobeyed my direct orders.

19:49.885 --> 19:52.120
Everyone involved tonight
is gonna get written up.

19:52.154 --> 19:53.721
Okay, fine.

19:53.722 --> 19:55.790
Here's everyone who was there.

19:55.791 --> 19:58.225
Jake Peralta,
J. Peralta,

19:58.226 --> 19:59.894
Dr. Jacob Peralta,

19:59.895 --> 20:01.962
who has a PhD
in slow-jam studies

20:01.963 --> 20:03.998
from funktown state university,

20:03.999 --> 20:07.368
also involved was the right
honorable J... okay, enough.

20:07.369 --> 20:09.570
My point is it was
a Peralta special, sir.

20:09.571 --> 20:10.772
No one else was there.

20:10.806 --> 20:13.475
Well, Detective,
I'm happy to see

20:13.476 --> 20:16.111
you're learning how to be
part of a team.

20:16.145 --> 20:19.680
Everybody go home.
Sleep it off.

20:20.749 --> 20:23.885
Sir?
Thank you.

20:23.919 --> 20:26.487
Ultimately, it was
our raw sexual chemistry

20:26.488 --> 20:29.523
that helped him overcome
his crippling fear.

20:29.524 --> 20:31.859
You should just stay
in the office all day every day

20:31.860 --> 20:34.295
and be my bestie.

20:34.296 --> 20:37.298
You could join
my dance troupe, floorgasm.

20:37.299 --> 20:39.767
We're looking for a man
of precisely your...

20:41.103 --> 20:43.137
It's gonna be a long road,

20:43.138 --> 20:45.239
but I'm ready to get myself
back in the game.

20:45.274 --> 20:46.340
I know you will.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.609
I mean, eventually...

20:48.610 --> 20:50.811
Not tonight.

20:50.812 --> 20:52.579
I need to go hug
my baby girls.

20:52.580 --> 20:54.882
Excuse me.

20:56.651 --> 20:58.452
Jake, I have to say,
the way you handled things

20:58.453 --> 21:00.454
with the vulture yesterday
was very mature.

21:00.489 --> 21:02.123
Well, sometimes in life,

21:02.124 --> 21:04.158
you just have to take
the high road.

21:04.159 --> 21:05.759
Oop! Time's up!

21:05.794 --> 21:07.661
- Can't wait to see it.
- Ah, here we go.

21:07.696 --> 21:09.630
- That's good suction.
- Oh!

21:09.631 --> 21:11.131
Ooh!

21:11.132 --> 21:12.265
Check it out!

21:12.266 --> 21:14.934
- Perfect, right?
- Yeah!

21:14.969 --> 21:17.604
"Dear vulture,

21:17.638 --> 21:21.674
"enjoy my big white ass.

21:21.709 --> 21:22.942
Jake."

21:22.943 --> 21:24.577
Here you are.

21:24.578 --> 21:26.246
Always take the high road,
Charles.

21:26.247 --> 21:27.814
Always take the high road.
