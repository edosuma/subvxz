WEBVTT

00:23.223 --> 00:25.891
>> good morning, philadelphia.

00:25.893 --> 00:29.128
With us today is frank reynolds,
local business owner and a man

00:29.130 --> 00:30.229
With a harrowing story.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.230
>> frank: That's right.

00:31.232 --> 00:35.234
A few days ago, three thugs
tried to mug me.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.503
And I want to be very clear
about something.

00:37.505 --> 00:40.906
>> these pieces of garbage, they
don't know who the hell they're

00:40.908 --> 00:41.907
Dealing with.

00:41.909 --> 00:45.044
Do you think maybe you could eat
that sandwich later?

00:45.046 --> 00:46.145
>> I'm starving.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.347
You don't have nothing to eat
in this show.

00:48.349 --> 00:49.381
>> let's get back to your story.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.382
>> right, so these punks...

00:50.384 --> 00:53.519
>> ...I don't know if they
wanted money or they wanted

00:53.521 --> 00:54.553
Something more sexual.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.521
>> wow.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.523
>> but it's a lucky thing I had
my pieces.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.557
>> your-your pieces?

00:58.559 --> 00:59.525
>> my guns.

00:59.527 --> 01:00.526
>> oh, my.

01:00.528 --> 01:01.593
>> anyway, I started blasting.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.362
Bah! Bah!

01:03.364 --> 01:05.531
Now, I don't see so good, so I
missed, then they ran away, I

01:05.533 --> 01:06.498
Ran after them.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.368
>> bang! Tried to shoot them in
the back, but I don't run so

01:09.370 --> 01:14.373
Anyway, you guys all think I'm a
hero, and I'll accept that

01:14.375 --> 01:15.874
Responsibility.

01:15.876 --> 01:18.377
>> now, weren't you concerned
though that an innocent

01:18.379 --> 01:19.378
Bystander may have...

01:19.380 --> 01:21.513
>> look, crime in this city is
out of control.

01:21.515 --> 01:25.851
>> thank god I went down to
gunther's guns and picked up a

01:25.853 --> 01:26.885
Spare.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.887
I don't think one would've done
it.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.856
I'm gonna go out and buy some
more.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.524
>> and I think you should, too.

01:32.526 --> 01:33.192
Don't be a victim.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.393
It's time to fight back.

01:34.395 --> 01:35.360
>> dennis: This is crazy.

01:35.362 --> 01:36.361
>> mac: Completely insane.

01:36.363 --> 01:38.030
>> dee: Oh, it's driving
me nuts.

01:38.032 --> 01:40.065
>> charlie: The whole gun thing,
it just makes me really hot.

01:40.067 --> 01:42.034
>> yeah, well, it's a hot issue
and I'm getting hot about it,

01:42.036 --> 01:44.403
>> this is good, we're all hot
at the same time.

01:44.405 --> 01:45.404
We should do something about...

01:45.406 --> 01:47.039
>> I mean, our schools aren't
safe.

01:47.041 --> 01:49.074
>> there are people out on the
streets with assault rifles?

01:49.076 --> 01:50.709
>> we're living in constant
fear!

01:50.711 --> 01:52.711
>> aw, guys, we got to get more
guns on the streets!

01:52.713 --> 01:53.745
>> yeah!

01:53.747 --> 01:54.713
Wait, what?

01:54.715 --> 01:56.715
>> we got to get more guns onto
the streets.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.383
>> yeah, we got to get guns in
the right hands.

01:58.385 --> 01:59.384
I mean, we're just not safe.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.086
>> that's what you guys are hot
about?

02:01.088 --> 02:02.721
>> yeah, didn't you hear what
frank said?

02:02.723 --> 02:05.757
>> there are too many guns on
the streets as it is.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.759
Guns off the streets is what we
need.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.728
>> it's way too easy for anybody
to just walk into a store and

02:09.730 --> 02:10.395
Get a gun.

02:10.397 --> 02:11.430
>> no, it's not.

02:11.432 --> 02:14.433
The government's trying to take
our guns away.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.068
It's way harder than you think,
dude.

02:16.070 --> 02:18.003
>> guys, we're hot about the
complete opposite.

02:18.005 --> 02:20.772
>> which is a bummer, 'cause I
thought we were on the same page

02:20.774 --> 02:21.773
For once.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.475
(clicking tongue)
>> still very hot though.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.844
>> oh, I'm even hotter if I'm
being honest.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.880
>> still hot.

02:52.505 --> 02:55.607
>> good call on these outfits,
dude.

02:55.609 --> 02:56.642
>> it's the only call.

02:56.644 --> 03:01.480
Like, you need a guy in a school
that even from a mile away, the

03:01.482 --> 03:03.849
School shooter sees that guy
and says, "uh-uh."

03:03.851 --> 03:05.884
>> "I ain't messing with that
dude."

03:05.886 --> 03:07.519
>> "I'm not messing with that
dude.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.622
>> macintyre: Uh, gentlemen, I
understand that you would

03:10.624 --> 03:13.659
Like to...

03:13.661 --> 03:15.661
You... How-how did you find me?

03:15.663 --> 03:17.296
>> oh, shit, I know this dude.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.564
>> who-who's this?

03:18.566 --> 03:21.200
>> this guy was the principal at
the high school where I was

03:21.202 --> 03:22.201
Doing the janitor thing.

03:22.203 --> 03:25.204
>> right, so why are you at a
middle school now?

03:25.206 --> 03:27.206
>> well, I was... I was
transferred.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.208
See, I have tenure, so they
couldn't actually fire me, which

03:29.210 --> 03:31.210
Was, of course, their first
choice, thanks to you.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.245
>> well, let's not throw barbs
at each other.

03:33.247 --> 03:35.247
Look, we're actually here for a
good cause.

03:35.249 --> 03:36.215
We want to protect this school.

03:36.217 --> 03:38.917
>> yeah, we want to be the armed
security guards.

03:38.919 --> 03:39.918
>> yeah, I brought a piece.

03:39.920 --> 03:40.919
We're good.

03:40.921 --> 03:41.920
>> hey, hey, hey, no, no!

03:41.922 --> 03:42.888
>> calm yourself.

03:42.890 --> 03:43.922
>> no, you got to put... No...

03:43.924 --> 03:44.890
>> it's not currently loaded.

03:44.892 --> 03:45.924
>> that's not the...

03:45.926 --> 03:46.925
Just put it away.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.895
I would not want to be around
this guy with a gun either.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.931
I mean, one little move and
he'll just start blasting.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.934
>> look, the point is he
shouldn't have a gun in a school

03:55.936 --> 03:56.935
In the first place anyway.

03:56.937 --> 03:57.936
>> no.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.005
>> guns just do not belong in
schools.

04:00.007 --> 04:00.939
>> no, they do not.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.542
>> that is why I brought along a
saber.

04:03.544 --> 04:07.012
>> which is just about the most
ridiculous thing I've ever seen

04:07.014 --> 04:09.047
In my life, because how are you
gonna stop a gunman with that?

04:09.049 --> 04:11.383
>> he's gonna get you from a
distance.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.352
>> if I come at you, I'll get to
you faster.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.053
We have been arguing about this
all day.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.021
>> because it's insanity.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.023
>> ooh, maybe you can be
the judge.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.024
>> I don't want... What?

04:19.026 --> 04:21.693
I'm gonna holster my weapon,
he'll holster his weapon.

04:21.695 --> 04:24.363
>> I'll do, like, a one, two,
three count, you tell us who

04:24.365 --> 04:28.033
>> look, dude, this is the only
way to tell, okay?

04:28.035 --> 04:30.035
And then we can protect your
school, but we got to go one

04:30.037 --> 04:31.069
Step at a time, all right?

04:31.071 --> 04:32.070
I mean, for god's sake...

04:32.072 --> 04:33.572
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:33.574 --> 04:34.640
Sorry, sorry.

04:34.642 --> 04:35.707
>> look out!

04:35.709 --> 04:39.611
(gun clicking empty)
ah.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.580
I guess I do have a hair
trigger, huh?

04:41.582 --> 04:42.281
>> yeah.

04:42.283 --> 04:43.282
>> all right.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.783
>> look at all these maniacs.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.818
Goddamn bloodthirsty freaks
walking in off the street.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.820
So easy for anybody to just
waltz in and buy a gun.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.490
Let's buy assault rifles and
just prove to mac and charlie

04:51.492 --> 04:52.457
How easy it is.

04:52.459 --> 04:53.458
>> oh, we're gonna, we're gonna.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.459
>> that's what we'll do.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.460
>> hi, how are you, sir?

04:55.462 --> 04:56.461
>> howdy, I'm gunther.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.496
What can I do for you?

04:57.498 --> 05:00.098
>> oh, gunther himself, purveyor
of destruction.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.467
I would like to buy a man
destroyer from you, please.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.469
>> yeah, nice to meet you,
gunther.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.172
Hey, maybe you could recommend
something that could blow a hole

05:07.174 --> 05:08.340
Through an elephant, you know.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.642
'cause I need that for my home
protection.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.643
>> yeah.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.845
>> I guess you're looking at an
ar-15.

05:13.847 --> 05:14.913
>> oh, look at that.

05:14.915 --> 05:18.016
Now, theoretically, gunther,
would I be able to slaughter a

05:18.018 --> 05:19.985
Roomful of innocent people
with that weapon?

05:19.987 --> 05:21.019
>> mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.487
>> brother, that'd be on you.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.189
>> that would be on me, wouldn't
it?

05:24.191 --> 05:25.691
Yeah, that wouldn't be on you
at all.

05:25.693 --> 05:26.358
>> but here you go.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.025
But here you go.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.361
Okay, great, we'll take one of
those, please.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.329
>> yeah, we got it.

05:30.331 --> 05:31.363
>> how much would that be?

05:31.365 --> 05:33.165
>> uh, that's $1,500.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.199
>> woof!

05:34.201 --> 05:35.967
$1,500 for the privilege, okay.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.537
Hey, what is your, uh, what
is your return policy there?

05:38.539 --> 05:39.938
>> 30 days, no charge.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.173
>> all right.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.107
>> ooh, 30 days, sounds fair.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.476
My goodness, dennis, this feels
good.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.844
Feels good in my hands.

05:45.846 --> 05:50.382
(both making machine gun noises)
oh, good my kids are safe.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.450
>> I saved everyone!

05:51.452 --> 05:52.451
>> yeah, my yard's protected.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.386
>> so, of course, it feels good,
you know?

05:54.388 --> 05:56.388
But that only proves our point
even more.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.123
We'll take two of these,
gunther.

05:58.125 --> 06:01.193
I'll need your licenses for the
background checks.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.227
>> okay, yeah.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.196
>> yeah, you can drive, you can
kill!

06:04.198 --> 06:07.666
(both laugh)
>> oh, christ, look at this.

06:07.668 --> 06:08.800
>> oh, god.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.736
>> oh, shit, I love this guy.

06:10.738 --> 06:13.071
>> ...Become a bit of a local
lightning rod in these gun

06:13.073 --> 06:14.072
Debates here.

06:14.074 --> 06:14.973
>> exactly.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.375
>> gun sales have skyrocketed.

06:16.377 --> 06:19.578
>> we're running out of guns,
and we have to manufacture more

06:19.580 --> 06:22.080
Guns; supply is not meeting
the demand.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.749
>> uncle jack: Can we... Can
we cut?

06:23.751 --> 06:25.851
Will my hands look this small on
the screen?

06:25.853 --> 06:29.154
>> I thought the camera would
add ten pounds to my hands, and

06:29.156 --> 06:30.222
I don't like the way they look.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.556
>> your hands look fine.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.691
Put them down.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.092
This is jack kelly.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.160
He's my attorney.

06:35.162 --> 06:38.397
He specializes in constitutional
law.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.365
>> our rights are being
infringed upon.

06:40.367 --> 06:43.402
And people like my client won't
take it anymore.

06:43.404 --> 06:46.738
>> the constitution guarantees
our second amendment rights.

06:46.740 --> 06:50.108
And these liberals like al gore,
they're trying to take that away

06:50.110 --> 06:52.411
From us with this global warming
bullshit.

06:52.413 --> 06:55.280
>> so, you see the two issues as
related somehow?

06:55.282 --> 06:56.748
>> damn right.

06:56.750 --> 07:00.085
>> the government of today has
no right telling us how to live

07:00.087 --> 07:02.120
Our lives, because the
government of 200 years ago

07:02.122 --> 07:03.422
Already did.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.222
>> yeah.

07:04.224 --> 07:10.128
>> they also protected us from
tyranny against the seizure of

07:10.130 --> 07:13.532
Tasteful, artistic photographs
of beautiful bodies.

07:13.534 --> 07:17.302
>> that same government wants to
come into our home, tell us what

07:17.304 --> 07:19.070
Is and what is not art?

07:19.072 --> 07:20.405
That's not right!

07:20.407 --> 07:22.407
>> okay, well, I'm gonna try
and, uh, keep things on track

07:22.409 --> 07:23.141
Here, so...

07:23.143 --> 07:26.812
Get out and get those guns
before they run out, and the

07:26.814 --> 07:28.647
Government changes the laws.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.449
(cheering, applause)
>> all right! Yeah!

07:30.451 --> 07:32.284
>> these idiots are buying this?

07:32.286 --> 07:33.084
>> it's crazy.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.286
>> what is going on?

07:34.288 --> 07:35.387
That was fast.

07:35.389 --> 07:36.555
>> you've been denied.

07:36.557 --> 07:37.589
>> what?

07:37.591 --> 07:38.256
That's ludicrous.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.458
Why?

07:39.460 --> 07:42.561
>> it says here you have an
extensive history of felonious

07:42.563 --> 07:43.895
Behavior.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.465
>> oh, there have been
incidents, sure, yeah, a few

07:46.467 --> 07:49.734
Minor indiscretions, but,
you know, I-I'm simply a person

07:49.736 --> 07:51.670
Of interest in most of those
cases, all right?

07:51.672 --> 07:54.840
Being wanted and being "wanted
for questioning" are very, very,

07:54.842 --> 07:56.074
Very different things, gunther.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.776
>> and you've been
institutionalized.

07:57.778 --> 07:58.777
>> me?

07:58.779 --> 08:02.914
>> what... I mean, one time, for
a short period of time.

08:02.916 --> 08:03.949
That-that was against my will.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.116
That doesn't even really count.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.852
>> that's the only time it
counts, dee.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.820
>> okay, look, it was, like, a
teeny thing that happened with a

08:08.822 --> 08:09.788
College roommate.

08:09.790 --> 08:10.956
It was really no big deal.

08:10.958 --> 08:11.623
>> uh, yeah.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.757
>> says here you burned her.

08:12.759 --> 08:13.525
>> I burned her, yeah.

08:13.527 --> 08:17.095
But... (laughs)
she was so annoying.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.497
I mean, it...

08:18.499 --> 08:19.831
She deserved it, okay?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.833
She was wearing my stuff, and
she was copying me, and...

08:21.835 --> 08:22.868
>> you were copying her.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.336
>> I was copying her, she was
copying me...

08:24.338 --> 08:27.806
>> look, I'm sorry, but I can't
sell you the guns.

08:27.808 --> 08:28.507
>> oh, god.

08:28.509 --> 08:29.508
>> oh, well, look at you.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.510
Oh, gunther the morality king.

08:31.512 --> 08:34.446
"hi, I'm gunther, I've never lit
anybody on fire before."

08:34.448 --> 08:37.649
You know, you light one bitch on
fire, and everybody freaks out!

08:37.651 --> 08:38.717
Oh, you son of a bitch.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.685
It was one time and one thing,
I just...

08:40.687 --> 08:42.320
>> all right, all right, all
right, relax, relax.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.656
(dee yells wildly)
okay, take it easy.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.525
Look, there are other ways to
buy guns where people don't go

08:46.527 --> 08:47.626
Snooping around in your past.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.127
Listen, pal...

08:49.129 --> 08:50.729
You just made my list.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.531
>> your list?

08:52.533 --> 08:53.665
>> yeah, I have a...

08:53.667 --> 08:54.666
>> shh.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.500
>> whatever, let's just go.

08:55.502 --> 08:56.201
>> let's go.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.370
>> how is that tasteless?

08:58.372 --> 08:59.371
It's art.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.071
>> get that out.

09:00.073 --> 09:00.906
Get that out.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.374
>> you can't even see the
child...

09:02.376 --> 09:10.549
Weather, traffic and a trip to
the zoo, coming right up.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.384
>> okay, charlie, I'm gonna
demonstrate to you how to thwart

09:12.386 --> 09:12.918
An attack.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.654
>> now, pretend that this dummy
is a school shooter.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.856
>> I want you to stand back,
'cause I don't want you to get

09:17.858 --> 09:20.559
Before he can draw his weapon...

09:20.561 --> 09:21.693
Hie-aught!

09:21.695 --> 09:22.694
Hup, hut, hut!

09:22.696 --> 09:24.763
Hie!

09:24.765 --> 09:26.264
How awesome was that?

09:26.266 --> 09:28.433
>> well, yeah, that's-that's
pretty awesome, but I feel like

09:28.435 --> 09:30.335
He would've shot you from a mile
away.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.437
>> no, no, he wouldn't, because
you saw how I was zigzagging

09:32.439 --> 09:33.538
Like this and making sounds?

09:33.540 --> 09:36.741
>> yeah, but did you ever see
<i>indiana jones,</i> where the guy

09:36.743 --> 09:38.543
Does the whole sword thing and
then he just shoots him dead?

09:38.545 --> 09:40.245
>> are you asking me if I've
seen <i>indiana jones?</i>

09:40.247 --> 09:41.780
Are you seriously asking me?

09:41.782 --> 09:42.581
I've seen that movie...

09:42.583 --> 09:43.281
That <i>is</i> my...

09:43.283 --> 09:44.082
You're not understanding.

09:44.084 --> 09:44.883
>> do you remember it?

09:44.885 --> 09:47.218
But if I were to come at you,
it's all about how I...

09:47.220 --> 09:49.788
(gun clicking empty)
okay, in that circumstance,

09:49.790 --> 09:51.389
Maybe you got there a little bit
faster.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.123
>> I got you.

09:52.125 --> 09:52.857
>> but if I...!

09:52.859 --> 09:53.592
Okay.

09:53.594 --> 09:56.962
>> but I... What if I zigzag
like this?

09:56.964 --> 09:59.631
>> and that's... That's not
necessarily...

09:59.633 --> 10:00.799
I don't think that that's...

10:00.801 --> 10:02.067
>> hold-hold on a second.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.201
Look at this kid.

10:03.203 --> 10:06.438
Ooh, he's wearing all black,
he's walking by himself.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.973
>> what do you think he's doing
on that phone?

10:07.975 --> 10:09.541
>> oh, I'll tell you exactly
what he's doing.

10:09.543 --> 10:11.309
He's playing one of those games
where you shoot everyone.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.777
I'm gonna profile this guy
really quick.

10:12.779 --> 10:13.445
Excuse us.

10:13.447 --> 10:14.379
>> yeah. Hey, kid, kid, kid.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.481
>> son, son, I'm sorry, hold
up, hold up. (laughs)

10:16.483 --> 10:18.249
What are you doing on the phone
there?

10:18.251 --> 10:19.250
>> none of your business.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.619
(charlie whistles)
>> a sass-mouth, huh?

10:20.621 --> 10:23.421
>> son, you were asked a
question by an adult, okay?

10:23.423 --> 10:25.123
You've been asked a question,
all right?

10:25.125 --> 10:27.325
We're trying to ensafen your
school here, okay?

10:27.327 --> 10:28.627
And you're acting like a punk?

10:28.629 --> 10:29.327
Let me see the phone.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.562
I want to see.

10:30.564 --> 10:31.930
Oh! He's killing zombies!

10:31.932 --> 10:32.664
I'm taking this.

10:32.666 --> 10:35.300
>> hey, kid, you're getting off
easy!

10:35.302 --> 10:36.067
Now get to school.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.902
>> just know we're watching you.

10:37.904 --> 10:38.903
>> go to class.

10:38.905 --> 10:39.671
>> be careful.

10:39.673 --> 10:40.739
>> look.

10:40.741 --> 10:44.142
These are the kids that are the
threats to society, the ones

10:44.144 --> 10:46.478
Playing the violent video games,
man.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.779
>> I play violent video games.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.081
>> well, yeah, I also play
violent video games.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.617
>> well, yeah, violent movies
are the best movies.

10:52.619 --> 10:54.252
>> and I don't want to kill
people.

10:54.254 --> 10:54.953
>> no, I mean...

10:54.955 --> 10:56.321
All right, this...

10:56.323 --> 10:58.123
Yeah, it's not really the best
way to tell, you know, who's

10:58.125 --> 10:59.924
Gonna be a threat or who's not
gonna...

10:59.926 --> 11:01.092
>> what is going on out here?

11:01.094 --> 11:02.661
>> nothing, thanks to us, bro.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.163
>> well, are-are you stealing
kids' cell phones?

11:05.165 --> 11:06.297
>> stealing, sir? No.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.333
I've been confiscating them as
potential evidence.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.335
>> are you aware that you're
holding children up with a gun

11:10.337 --> 11:13.371
You just... You need to stay off
of school property.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.373
>> sir, we are not on the school
property, okay?

11:15.375 --> 11:17.175
>> yeah, we're outside of the
fence by, like...

11:17.177 --> 11:20.679
>> you need to stay 1,000 yards
away from school property.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.514
>> I mean, we're trying to keep
the school safe!

11:22.516 --> 11:25.450
Well, yeah, we would all feel a
lot safer if you were further

11:25.452 --> 11:28.053
>> all right, I'm taking this
guy out.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.054
>> hey, whoa, settle!

11:29.056 --> 11:30.689
Settle, settle, settle!

11:30.691 --> 11:33.725
>> would you please stop
pointing that gun at me?

11:33.727 --> 11:35.627
(gun clicks empty)
>> the school is safe, thanks

11:35.629 --> 11:36.528
To us.

11:36.530 --> 11:39.464
>> well... Please, just... If
you could just get away from the

11:39.466 --> 11:40.398
School.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.399
Get away from the children.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.535
>> just-just stay away from the
children.

11:43.537 --> 11:44.469
>> have a good day, sir.

11:44.471 --> 11:45.136
>> thank you.

11:45.138 --> 11:45.870
>> have a good day.

11:45.872 --> 11:46.404
>> go.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.039
>> we're leaving, we're leaving.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.240
>> we're leaving.

11:49.242 --> 11:52.410
>> you know, charlie, if we
can't be in the school zone,

11:52.412 --> 11:54.412
Maybe we need to train somebody
who can be.

11:54.414 --> 11:59.384
You know, someone you'd never
suspect could stop a shooter.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.453
I got an idea.

12:10.496 --> 12:13.598
>> and here we are, dee, at a
gun show, huh?

12:13.600 --> 12:15.233
Lowest common denominator.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.534
>> is that a bazooka?

12:16.536 --> 12:18.536
>> insanely dangerous, this
place is.

12:18.538 --> 12:19.504
It's crazy.

12:19.506 --> 12:20.538
Oh, look at this guy right here.

12:20.540 --> 12:21.673
He'll probably sell us a gun.

12:21.675 --> 12:22.741
Excuse me, sir.

12:22.743 --> 12:25.110
Um, I would like to buy a gun
from you.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.879
Something that is unnecessarily
powerful, something you would

12:27.881 --> 12:31.182
>> yeah, ooh, ooh, but you know
what you shouldn't do though,

12:31.184 --> 12:33.118
Is look into our very sketchy
pasts.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.120
>> no. (laughs)
>> uh, it's not a problem.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.221
We all got a sketchy past.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.690
(dennis laughs)
>> oh, genuine creep. Wonderful.

12:38.692 --> 12:39.691
>> perfect.

12:39.693 --> 12:42.594
Hey, sir, could you please sell
us this ar-15?

12:42.596 --> 12:45.597
>> uh, despite, you know, who or
what we plan to obliterate

12:45.599 --> 12:46.598
With it.

12:46.600 --> 12:47.599
And don't ask questions, okay?

12:47.601 --> 12:48.900
>> no.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.602
>> 'cause we just want to prove
to our friends how easy it is to

12:50.604 --> 12:51.736
Buy a high-capacity rifle.

12:51.738 --> 12:52.771
>> absolutely.

12:52.773 --> 12:56.307
Hey, so give this guy his 1,500
bucks, and we'll just saunter

12:56.309 --> 12:59.310
Right out of here with a weapon
of mass extinction.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.311
>> three grand.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.312
>> what? I'm sorry.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.280
>> that's $3,000.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.314
>> no, not for this.

13:03.316 --> 13:04.282
No, for this, for this.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.250
>> no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.919
>> (laughs): Oh, this ain't
gunther's.

13:07.921 --> 13:08.920
>> this a price gouge?

13:08.922 --> 13:09.921
>> oh, my.

13:09.923 --> 13:10.955
>> that's illegal.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.791
>> oh, you see, I'm a private
seller.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.592
That means I can do whatever I
want.

13:14.594 --> 13:15.293
>> shit.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.495
We'll buy it, and we'll
return it.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.496
>> all sales are final.

13:18.498 --> 13:21.399
>> I'll show you what's final,
you redneck son of a bitch!

13:21.401 --> 13:23.468
I will burn you alive like the
last bitch who crossed me!

13:23.470 --> 13:25.170
>> okay, all right, all right,
dee.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.104
That's not getting us anywhere.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.506
>> I went... I went hot real
fast; it just happened.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.275
>> well, our whole crew's been
hot lately.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.277
We're trying to cool down, but
you're not making it any easier.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.479
>> all right, listen, I want
this gun, pal.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.181
Okay, I want it, because it's
easy to buy a gun.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.016
And I need to prove that to
some people, so give me the gun

13:38.018 --> 13:39.751
At a fair price, and do it now.

13:39.753 --> 13:40.518
>> $4,000.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.252
>> shit!

13:41.254 --> 13:42.854
>> four thou...? $4,000?

13:42.856 --> 13:43.855
Really?

13:43.857 --> 13:47.125
(cocks gun)
how about I just take it, huh?

13:47.127 --> 13:49.360
'cause I'm a maniac with a
gun, and there's nothing you

13:49.362 --> 13:52.964
Can do about it. (chuckles)
(guns cocking)

13:52.966 --> 13:55.667
(dee gasps)
>> oh. Oh, oh.

13:55.669 --> 13:56.668
>> okay.

13:56.670 --> 13:57.669
>> oh, okay.

13:57.671 --> 14:00.305
>> oops. (laughs)
>> putting the gun down now.

14:00.307 --> 14:04.876
Okay, this is just a... Just an
exercise, okay, to prove how

14:04.878 --> 14:06.644
Unsafe it is...

14:06.646 --> 14:08.813
For everyone to have guns, okay?

14:08.815 --> 14:12.684
But I see now that I was the
maniac with the gun.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.886
And you all made it safer...

14:14.888 --> 14:16.120
In here.

14:16.122 --> 14:16.788
>> yeah.

14:16.790 --> 14:24.963
>> our bad, our bad for
this experiment.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.364
>> thank you for joining us.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.400
I know you may not see yourself
as a solution to a

14:29.402 --> 14:33.571
>> you might not think you have
the ability, but, uh, believe

14:33.573 --> 14:36.507
Me, you were... You were
carefully selected.

14:36.509 --> 14:39.310
>> and with a little hard work
and a whole lot of training, we

14:39.312 --> 14:41.346
Can help you keep your
school safe.

14:41.348 --> 14:42.647
Are there any questions?

14:42.649 --> 14:44.048
>> yo, can I get some beer?

14:44.050 --> 14:46.517
>> no. We said it, like,
a million times.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.987
>> guys, guys, how many times do
we have to be through this?

14:48.989 --> 14:51.723
>> all right, you know, you
can't drink beer and be

14:51.725 --> 14:54.058
>> but you guys had, like, five.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.493
>> don't count beers, carlos.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.763
>> yeah. And by the way, carlos,
I've had six.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.365
>> and I've had seven.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.699
So don't be a rat, okay?

15:01.701 --> 15:04.736
>> and if you are gonna be a
rat, get it right.

15:04.738 --> 15:05.937
>> no more questions.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.205
In fact, no more questions.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.407
>> you guys are the ones that
asked for the questions.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.541
>> shut up, carlos!

15:10.543 --> 15:12.010
>> carlos, shut up!

15:12.012 --> 15:13.878
>> the time for questions
is over.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.079
It's now time for learning.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.749
>> okay? You're-you're impeding
on your own safety.

15:17.751 --> 15:21.085
>> okay, now my friend and I
have been arguing all day about

15:21.087 --> 15:24.455
The efficacy of swords
versus guns.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.357
>> okay? So we met in
the middle.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.960
Now if you look under your
seat, you'll see that each of

15:28.962 --> 15:32.196
You has been provided a weapon
that you could easily find in

15:32.198 --> 15:33.431
Your own classroom.

15:33.433 --> 15:37.101
>> some of you may have
compasses, others,

15:37.103 --> 15:41.105
>> okay, there are forks in
the cafeteria, there's piano

15:41.107 --> 15:42.807
Wire from the music room.

15:42.809 --> 15:46.244
>> you need to learn how to make
every single item in your

15:46.246 --> 15:48.212
School a potentially
life-threatening weapon.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.048
>> look at the person
sitting next to you.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.950
That person wants to take
you out.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.885
>> guys, safety is the name
of the game.

15:53.887 --> 15:54.886
It's all about safety.

15:54.888 --> 15:58.957
>> we're gonna take this in a
safe and orderly fashion.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.893
Are you ready to begin?

16:01.895 --> 16:08.566
>> and, guys, let's have
a little fun.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.268
(kids yelling)
>> shut it, shut it, shut it!

16:10.270 --> 16:13.271
>> oh, my god, I think they're
all in gangs or something!

16:13.273 --> 16:15.273
There's a lot of score settling
going on in there!

16:15.275 --> 16:17.575
Oh, yeah, dude, we created
a  <i>hunger games-type</i>scenario

16:17.577 --> 16:19.143
Imagine if they had guns!

16:19.145 --> 16:20.278
>> oh, it'd be a disaster!

16:20.280 --> 16:21.012
An absolute disaster!

16:21.014 --> 16:22.080
These kids are all too violent.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.748
It's, like, ingrained in them
or something.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.817
>> oh, my god, dude, we've been
singing the wrong tune.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.653
We need to get the weapons
<i>out</i> of their hands!

16:28.655 --> 16:30.788
>> maybe we should call the
cops, the only people who should

16:30.790 --> 16:33.124
They got to come in here,
they got to calm this down!

16:33.126 --> 16:34.993
(door banging)
>> oh! Oh, shit, charlie, I got

16:34.995 --> 16:36.361
To admit something, dude.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.495
I'm bleeding pretty bad.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.997
>> one of the kids got you?

16:38.999 --> 16:41.466
>> I nicked myself back in the
principal's office just trying

16:41.468 --> 16:42.467
To upholster my weapon.

16:42.469 --> 16:45.503
>> I didn't want to say anything
'cause it was a little bit

16:45.505 --> 16:48.339
(door bangs)
all right, can I go to

16:48.341 --> 16:48.873
The hospital?

16:48.875 --> 16:49.607
>> yeah, let's go.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.976
Go, go, go, go, go.

16:51.978 --> 16:54.545
>> frank (over radio): First
they disarm us, then they

16:54.547 --> 16:58.683
So I want you to get
every gun you can buy and bring

16:58.685 --> 17:03.321
It to 17th and jfk, and we're
gonna March on city hall.

17:03.323 --> 17:07.225
>> and bring whatever guests
you want, regardless of age or

17:07.227 --> 17:09.360
Whatever restriction the
government puts on our

17:09.362 --> 17:10.528
Expression of beauty.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.530
>> just get the guns and bring
them down to city hall.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.499
>> well, you better believe I'll
be there.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.333
>> I know you'll be there.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.167
>> bring your kid.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.201
You have kids?

17:17.203 --> 17:18.836
>> yes, of course, of course.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.204
>> bring them.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.373
He's really going off the deep
end, dee.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.876
I hate to admit it, dennis, but
he's got a point, you know.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.844
It doesn't seem like it's all
that easy to buy an assault

17:26.846 --> 17:27.512
Rifle.

17:27.514 --> 17:28.513
>> no, no, no, no, no.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.214
Don't you start with that shit,
dee.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.184
>> it is incredibly easy to buy
an assault rifle, and I'm gonna

17:33.186 --> 17:35.386
Prove to you how easy it is
right now.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.387
Okay, here comes our guy.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.323
Mm, mm. No.

17:39.325 --> 17:40.491
Hi.

17:40.493 --> 17:41.726
>> uh, you got my money?

17:41.728 --> 17:43.728
>> (scoffs) you got my
people-killer?

17:43.730 --> 17:44.729
>> right here.

17:44.731 --> 17:45.763
>> oh, ho, ho, ho.

17:45.765 --> 17:46.831
That's the stuff, baby.

17:46.833 --> 17:50.101
Now, I got $1,500, which is the
fair asking price.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.737
I hope that's okay.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.172
>> yeah. Give it to me.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.074
>> all right. There you go.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.176
All right, now, I'm not really
totally comfortable rolling the

17:58.178 --> 18:01.179
I'm sure you understand why, so
I'm just gonna pop the trunk and

18:01.181 --> 18:03.181
You can, uh, you can throw it
in there, all right?

18:03.183 --> 18:03.848
>> back there?

18:03.850 --> 18:04.849
>> yeah.

18:04.851 --> 18:05.850
>> in the trunk?

18:05.852 --> 18:06.551
>> yeah.

18:06.553 --> 18:07.518
>> okay, I got you.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.520
>> you see how easy that is,
dee?

18:09.522 --> 18:12.123
You just give a man $1,500 and
he gives you an assault rifle.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.091
>> uh-oh. Ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.125
>> what? Where's he going?

18:14.127 --> 18:16.094
>> well, he appears to be
sauntering off.

18:16.096 --> 18:16.928
>> well, don't do... No.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.796
Well, sir, I gave you the
$1,500.

18:18.798 --> 18:19.797
Don't saunter away. I'm try...

18:19.799 --> 18:20.865
That's not fair!

18:20.867 --> 18:21.866
>> no, it's not fair!

18:21.868 --> 18:22.800
You stop right now!

18:22.802 --> 18:24.402
Listen, you stop in your tracks!

18:24.404 --> 18:25.536
Uh, dennis, go stop him.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.238
>> denni... Go stop...?

18:27.240 --> 18:28.206
The man has an assault rifle!

18:28.208 --> 18:29.207
What am I supposed to do?!

18:29.209 --> 18:30.241
>> shit!

18:30.243 --> 18:33.244
>> the only thing that stops a
bad guy with a gun is a good guy

18:33.246 --> 18:35.246
With a gun, which we can't get!

18:35.248 --> 18:37.615
Goddamn son of a bitch frank,
you were right!

18:37.617 --> 18:38.716
>> frank was right!

18:38.718 --> 18:43.087
(tires screech)
(door opens)

18:43.089 --> 18:43.988
>> where's frank? We're hot.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.123
We're coming in super hot!

18:45.125 --> 18:45.790
>> where is frank?!

18:45.792 --> 18:46.491
>> oh, you guys hot?

18:46.493 --> 18:47.325
>> you guys are still hot?

18:47.327 --> 18:50.094
>> oh, yeah, I'm burning up
right now!

18:50.096 --> 18:51.095
>> it's a crazy situation!

18:51.097 --> 18:52.263
>> we're on your side now!

18:52.265 --> 18:54.465
We got to get these guns off
the streets!

18:54.467 --> 18:55.433
>> boo-yah!

18:55.435 --> 18:56.467
>> wait, what? No, no.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.435
>> off the streets?

18:57.437 --> 18:58.436
What are you, crazy?

18:58.438 --> 18:59.637
We need the guns on the streets!

18:59.639 --> 19:00.605
>> everyone needs to have guns!

19:00.607 --> 19:02.607
We need to flood the streets
with guns!

19:02.609 --> 19:03.608
>> to stay safe.

19:03.610 --> 19:04.609
>> aw, shit.

19:04.611 --> 19:05.910
I mean, I think, uh...

19:05.912 --> 19:07.912
You know, I think we crossed
right past each other like ships

19:07.914 --> 19:08.946
In the night, man.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.582
>> yeah, 'cause we're on the
opposite side now.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.584
That side makes no more sense
to me.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.353
>> if we could've just met up,
like, two hours ago...

19:15.355 --> 19:16.287
>> oh, oh, there's frank.

19:16.289 --> 19:17.288
Hey, frank!

19:17.290 --> 19:18.289
Frank, is that a box of guns?

19:18.291 --> 19:19.257
What is that?

19:19.259 --> 19:20.591
>> guns? No.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.660
Water filters.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.995
>> water filters?

19:23.997 --> 19:25.296
>> all right, guys, load 'em in.

19:25.298 --> 19:28.466
>> hey, frank, why do you have a
truck full of water filters?

19:28.468 --> 19:30.434
Uh, you know what, I don't give
a shit.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.136
Let's get down to that rally,
man.

19:32.138 --> 19:32.770
>> rally?

19:32.772 --> 19:33.437
>> yeah.

19:33.439 --> 19:34.272
>> yes, the freedom rally.

19:34.274 --> 19:37.108
>> ooh, shit, I'm not gonna go
down there.

19:37.110 --> 19:39.110
It's gonna be a bunch of nuts
with guns.

19:39.112 --> 19:40.111
Too dangerous.

19:40.113 --> 19:41.112
>> wait, hold on a second.

19:41.114 --> 19:41.812
What's going on?

19:41.814 --> 19:44.815
You know, why have you been on
tv talking about all that shit?

19:44.817 --> 19:46.817
>> I bought a stake in gunther's
guns.

19:46.819 --> 19:48.786
I got everybody angry and
scared.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.821
They bought the guns, I made a
fortune.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.156
>> oh, my god. This is crazy.

19:52.158 --> 19:54.125
So you don't give a shit about
the gun issue at all?

19:54.127 --> 19:55.159
>> uh, uh...

19:55.161 --> 19:56.127
>> I mean, what the hell?

19:56.129 --> 19:57.128
You're like the nra.

19:57.130 --> 19:59.130
>> yeah, a little bit like
the nra.

19:59.132 --> 20:00.164
Little tiny bit.

20:00.166 --> 20:03.000
But I-I think of myself more
like al gore.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.536
You know, he got everybody
worked up over global warming.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.904
Then he made millions.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.206
>> huh?!

20:08.208 --> 20:09.574
>> yeah. Everybody does it.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.909
Liberals, conservatives, doesn't
matter.

20:11.911 --> 20:15.213
This is america: You're either a
duper or a dupee.

20:15.215 --> 20:16.314
I'm a duper.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.316
You guys are the dupees.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.051
I got to go.

20:20.053 --> 20:23.054
>> where you going now?

20:23.056 --> 20:26.023
>> with us now is local
community activist, frank

20:26.025 --> 20:28.192

statistic.

20:28.194 --> 20:29.193
Frank?

20:29.195 --> 20:30.695
>> yes. Thank you, chet.

20:30.697 --> 20:37.201
>> do you know that 90% of your
water is 100% toxins?

20:37.203 --> 20:39.170
Who knows what the other 10% is?

20:39.172 --> 20:41.205
>> it's probably far worse, I
would imagine.

20:41.207 --> 20:45.876
I have a water filter for you
that you need to put in every

20:45.878 --> 20:47.545
Single home.

20:47.547 --> 20:50.248
It will protect you and your
entire family.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.717
You can even give that water to
your babies.

20:52.719 --> 20:57.255
Well, babies, look out, because
this next segment is just for

20:57.257 --> 20:58.422
You.

20:58.424 --> 20:59.557
Don't turn that channel.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.025
Your life may depend upon it.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.226
>> got to give it to him.

21:02.228 --> 21:03.027
He is good.

21:03.029 --> 21:04.028

21:04.030 --> 21:04.962
>> goddamn.

21:04.964 --> 21:05.963

21:05.965 --> 21:07.965
(dee sighs)
I think I'm gonna get one of

21:07.967 --> 21:08.966
Those water filters.

21:08.968 --> 21:09.967
>> I do kind of want one, right?

21:09.969 --> 21:10.968
>> for safety, for safety.

>> I mean, he does make some
good points.
