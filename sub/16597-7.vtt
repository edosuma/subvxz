WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:05.839
Dr. Park.

00:05.873 --> 00:09.077
What's your stance
on mimosas in the afternoon?

00:09.110 --> 00:11.312
Taboo or trailblazing?

00:12.380 --> 00:14.082
Um, trailblazing?

00:14.115 --> 00:16.517
Then why
you sitting there, girl?

00:16.550 --> 00:18.752
(CHUCKLES)
Let's hit the kitchen

00:18.786 --> 00:20.888
and mix some Korbel
with a little SunnyD.

00:20.921 --> 00:23.524
Oh, Ken,
you're so bad.

00:23.557 --> 00:24.858
(LAUGHS)
(DOOR SLAMS)

00:27.228 --> 00:28.596
Are you okay, honey?

00:28.629 --> 00:30.398
Ahh. Mim-oh-so close.

00:32.966 --> 00:35.002
MacKenzie Hawkins
started a nonprofit

00:35.035 --> 00:38.005
to teach computer literacy
to senior citizens!

00:39.373 --> 00:40.908
What a...bitch?

00:42.876 --> 00:44.578
She's applying
to Stanford, too.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.280
How am I supposed
to compete with that?

00:46.314 --> 00:48.216
I mean,
hopefully my SATs
will improve,

00:48.249 --> 00:49.783
but my resume is weak.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.852
I didn't help a bunch
of old people get on Tinder!

00:53.287 --> 00:55.289
Well, um,
fall break's coming up.

00:55.323 --> 00:57.125
Maybe you could volunteer
at the HMO.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.427
That could be some valuable
work experience.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.295
Yeah.
That sounds really good.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.863
Do you think you guys
could set it up for me?

01:02.896 --> 01:04.064
Mmm. I don't know.

01:04.098 --> 01:05.699
I mean, will people say,
"Whoa, whoa.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.368
"Ken Park,
such a big shot.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.636
"He threw
his weight around

01:08.669 --> 01:10.238
"and got his daughter
a plum internship"?

01:10.271 --> 01:11.605
Well, they might...

01:11.639 --> 01:13.374
Great!
Just wanted to make sure.
Consider it done.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.011
Well,
my dream has come true.

01:18.045 --> 01:19.813
You finally tried
all 31 flavors?

01:20.681 --> 01:22.583
No,
still stuck on 30.

01:23.951 --> 01:26.654
But I just found out
I'm gonna be on Shark Tank.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.189
Shark Tank?

01:28.222 --> 01:29.790
Oh my God.
How'd that happen?

01:29.823 --> 01:31.425
I sent in
an application video.

01:31.459 --> 01:34.027
They liked my invention,
and they invited me
to come on the show!

01:34.061 --> 01:35.596
That's amazing!
I know!

01:35.629 --> 01:37.698
Why didn't you tell us
you were doing this?

01:37.731 --> 01:39.300
I wanted to wait
until I heard back.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.901
Gotta manage the hype, yo.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.472
So what's your invention?

01:44.505 --> 01:46.140
You know how
when you're sleeping at night

01:46.174 --> 01:49.710
and your body's nice and warm
but your legs get too hot?

01:49.743 --> 01:51.579
Yes!
That does happen to me!

01:52.746 --> 01:55.783
Introducing
The Hot Legs Duvet.

02:01.522 --> 02:05.426
It...looks like a blanket
with two holes cut out.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.362
It's the ultimate thermal
body-temperature regulator.

02:08.396 --> 02:10.364
It's a sleep revolution.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.601
Dave,
I'm so proud of you.

02:13.634 --> 02:17.371
And I say,
"Long live The Hot
Legs Duvet!"

02:24.144 --> 02:26.447
Guys, are you ready
for this news?

02:26.480 --> 02:27.781
Dave's going to be
on Shark Tank!

02:27.815 --> 02:29.016
Oh, my God!
Really?

02:29.049 --> 02:30.584
That's amazing!
What's his invention?

02:30.618 --> 02:33.787
He calls it
The Hot Legs Duvet.
It's so cute.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.790
Ohh, I hope it's more
than just cute.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.959
Well, it's basically a blanket
with holes in it.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.761
I think cute was
rounding it up. Why?

02:40.794 --> 02:43.564
Well, the Sharks
can be pretty rough.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.433
What do you mean?
You've never seen
the show?

02:45.466 --> 02:47.568
I'm too wiped out
to watch TV on Friday nights

02:47.601 --> 02:51.171
because Thursday nights,
Allison and I have...

02:51.205 --> 02:52.873
(CHUCKLES) Come on.
We're all medical
professionals.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.208
I can say it out loud.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.143
Ken and Alli's Fun-time
Boom-boom Hour.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.847
You should know, Damona.
You manage my calendar.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.982
Wait. Girl, you actually
put that in his calendar?

03:02.015 --> 03:04.485
Hey, I'd rather have that job
than Allison's.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.686
Ha!

03:07.020 --> 03:08.456
Check this out,
little man.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.658
There's a reason why
they call it Shark Tank.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.860
You're not an entrepreneur.
You're a want-repreneur.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.328
And for that reason, I'm out.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.364
Things are either heroes
or zeroes.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.165
For me, this is
a nowhere-near-o.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.900
I'm out.
You're dead to me.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.134
JOHN: You're dead to me, too.

03:21.168 --> 03:23.504
"You're dead to me"?

03:23.537 --> 03:25.138
That's his catchphrase.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.741
What kind of a monster
uses that as a catchphrase?

03:27.775 --> 03:29.777
A bald, handsome monster.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.281
I can't let Dave
go on that show.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.948
Those Sharks
will eat him alive.

03:34.982 --> 03:37.318
Ah, I love watching the Sharks
crush the dreams

03:37.351 --> 03:39.353
of people just trying
to improve their lot in life.

03:39.387 --> 03:42.122
(SIGHS)
Fools!

03:42.155 --> 03:44.392
The world's a human zoo.
Stay in your cages.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.234
What are all those?

03:54.268 --> 03:56.370
Oh, I'm putting them aside
for Molly to file.

03:56.404 --> 03:57.971
She's volunteering this week,
remember?

03:58.005 --> 03:59.340
Oh, right.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.841
That's this week.
Yay.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.443
What is wrong with you?

04:02.476 --> 04:04.177
Let's just say,

04:04.211 --> 04:07.080
there's been some
tension lately between
Molly and I.

04:07.114 --> 04:09.317
What?
When do you even see Molly?

04:09.350 --> 04:11.985
Online, Damona,
where the world is.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.323
A couple of days ago,
I posted a picture

04:15.356 --> 04:17.425
of me and Connor hiking,

04:18.091 --> 04:19.293
and she didn't like it.

04:19.327 --> 04:20.561
(GASPS) Oh, no!

04:20.594 --> 04:22.029
And you guys
have homeroom together.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.931
That's gonna be
so awkward.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.399
(CHUCKLES)

04:25.433 --> 04:28.168
Clark, you're a grown man.
She's a teenager.

04:28.201 --> 04:29.703
Why do you even care
what Molly thinks?

04:29.737 --> 04:32.873
Look, I know it seems petty,
but I'm sensitive, okay?

04:32.906 --> 04:34.074
Plus, this is the first time

04:34.107 --> 04:35.343
that I've posted a picture
of me and Connor.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.144
Well, how do you even know
she saw it?

04:37.177 --> 04:39.079
Oh, please.
She is 17.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.514
She lives online.

04:40.548 --> 04:44.017
She saw the photo,
she didn't like it,
and that stings.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.053
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Hey, everybody.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.822
And I don't know
if I'm going to be able
to keep up appearances!

04:49.857 --> 04:51.124
Molly, my girl!

04:51.158 --> 04:52.460
How are you guys?
What's happening?

04:52.493 --> 04:53.661
Oh, not much.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.997
Just trying to get
some exercise recently.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.567
Oh, yeah!
I saw you and Connor
went hiking this weekend.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.373
Yeah, we did.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.709
No big deal.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.915
Hi. I'm here
for my appointment.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.584
You're a week late,
Mr. Dempsey.

05:16.617 --> 05:19.720
You were supposed to be
here last Thursday,
but you no-showed.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.054
You know what?
Just go have a seat.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.023
I'll see if I can fit you in.
(MUMBLING)

05:25.459 --> 05:26.960
Do a lot of patients miss
their appointments?

05:26.994 --> 05:29.763
Yes.
And we don't like it.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.902
Have you guys tried
sending out auto-text
reminders?

05:34.935 --> 05:36.504
Uh, the I.T. guy was supposed
to set it up,

05:36.537 --> 05:38.071
but then radiology
got hacked,

05:38.105 --> 05:40.273
and then it's been
all nerds on deck.

05:41.274 --> 05:42.643
Well,
I can do it for you.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.277
Oh! Go for it.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.016
Okay, your operating
system has this
appointment function.

05:49.049 --> 05:52.586
Mm-hmm.
You just sync your contacts
to your calendar,

05:52.620 --> 05:55.523
and hit automatic alert.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.757
Done!

05:56.790 --> 05:59.326
Wow.
You sure know how to
work a computer...

06:01.762 --> 06:03.664
when it suits you.
(CLIPBOARD THUDS)

06:06.066 --> 06:08.702
Auto-texts.
What a terrific idea.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.871
It'll save Welltopia
scads of cash.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.172
Just scads of it.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.776
Why are we wasting her
talents on patient care?

06:15.809 --> 06:18.011
Molly, how would you like it
if your resume said

06:18.045 --> 06:20.247
that after just one morning,
you catapulted

06:20.280 --> 06:22.650
all the way into
the Management Training
Program?

06:22.683 --> 06:23.917
Really?

06:26.053 --> 06:28.422
These are
my personal receipts.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.424
Now, I need you
to go through these,

06:30.458 --> 06:32.325
figure out which ones
I can write off.

06:32.359 --> 06:33.994
And I'm not
going to lie to you,

06:34.027 --> 06:37.330
it's been quite a while
since I filed a tax return.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.500
Now, most of these you'll see
the name Pat Hein,

06:39.533 --> 06:42.536
but occasionally,
I do business as
Pancho Vermont.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.271
Wait, so...

06:44.304 --> 06:45.706
Fewer questions, the better.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.315
Hey.
What's going on?

06:55.348 --> 06:57.485
We're making sample duvets
for the Sharks.

06:57.518 --> 06:58.919
Great stuff, Buddy.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.054
Hey, why don't you go rest
that cutting hand?

07:01.088 --> 07:02.255
I need to talk to your mom.

07:02.289 --> 07:04.858
Okay.
You can take
a break too, Mom.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.026
You've earned it.

07:06.494 --> 07:07.661
Thanks, Dave.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.368
We can't let him go
on that show.
Those Sharks are vicious.

07:15.402 --> 07:17.204
Yeah,
you'd never seen the show?

07:17.237 --> 07:18.906
(SIGHS)
I'm tired on Fridays, Al.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.775
You know how Thursday
nights wear me out.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.844
As someone who's tried
to push you beyond
the basics,

07:23.877 --> 07:24.945
yes, I do.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.651
Dave's really excited
for this.

07:30.684 --> 07:31.985
And do you know
how many people

07:32.019 --> 07:33.153
are going to get
to see him on TV?

07:33.186 --> 07:34.722
Exactly.
That's my point.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.558
And if it's a disaster,
it'll stay with him forever.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.459
Trust me.
I've been there.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.228
Science fair.
Junior high.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.497
I made one of those
baking-soda volcanoes.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.166
Uh, cliche much?

07:46.199 --> 07:48.301
Uh, no,
because instead of vinegar,

07:48.335 --> 07:49.937
I used carbolic acid.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.338
Mmm?

07:51.371 --> 07:53.373
Bigger eruption,
little more pizzazz.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.008
Did it work?

07:55.042 --> 07:56.076
Yes!

07:56.109 --> 07:57.511
And then no.

07:58.746 --> 08:01.448
The lava was so hot,
it ate through the gym floor.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.884
There was a giant hole
at center court!

08:03.917 --> 08:06.153
At first, the basketball team
played around cones,

08:06.186 --> 08:08.455
but then they
canceled the season
when two kids fell in.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.625
Were they okay?
Yeah, they were fine.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.226
But you know who wasn't?

08:13.260 --> 08:15.929
Ol' Kenny Park,
that's who.

08:15.963 --> 08:18.265
I don't want Dave
to go through that
kind of humiliation.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.267
Wow.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.936
That is sad
and (LAUGHS) hilarious.

08:24.805 --> 08:28.642
But that shouldn't stop
us from letting Dave
take risks.

08:28.676 --> 08:29.977
Don't you trust
that we've given him

08:30.010 --> 08:31.645
the tools to cope
with disappointment?

08:32.479 --> 08:33.513
No!

08:35.215 --> 08:37.751
I need you to sign
this release so I can
go on the show.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.654
I also need
to take my Lactaid.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.056
I'm attempting
flavor 31 tonight...

08:43.090 --> 08:44.424
jamoca almond fudge.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.394
This is a big week for me.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.332
Okay,
I am not signing that, Al.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.435
Absolutely not.
As a parent,
I refuse to allow...

08:55.468 --> 08:56.904
Oh.
Did not see that coming.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.315
So, how are things going
with my receipts?

09:08.348 --> 09:09.549
I'm still on the first bag,

09:09.583 --> 09:12.653
which is a lot of dry cleaning
and juice bars.

09:12.686 --> 09:15.122
Well,
what can I tell you?

09:15.155 --> 09:18.391
I like my shirts
like I like my juices...
pressed.

09:20.527 --> 09:22.162
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

09:22.195 --> 09:23.363
Ah!
(CHUCKLES)

09:24.464 --> 09:25.666
Obligatory laughter.

09:25.699 --> 09:28.535
You'll go far
in the business world.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.304
You know, I was a lot
like you at your age.

09:31.338 --> 09:34.241
Ambitious, beautiful,

09:35.809 --> 09:38.712
and always with
one eye on the old
college application.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.313
So where you thinking
about going, anyway?

09:40.347 --> 09:42.149
Well, Stanford's
my first choice.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.416
My alma mater!

09:43.450 --> 09:45.619
Wait, you went there?
Oh my God.
Yes.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.454
Oh, the best years
of my life.

09:47.487 --> 09:48.756
The hills.
The quad.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.924
My only regret is
I graduated in
three years.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.826
You did?
Yeah.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.262
Then I was recruited
by a tech start-up
in Silicon Valley.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.297
Wow.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.799
Do you think you could
maybe write me

09:58.832 --> 10:00.067
a letter
of recommendation?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.302
Hey, if you can make
sense of this mess

10:02.335 --> 10:04.571
and keep the pesky IRS
off my back.

10:05.706 --> 10:06.940
I will not let you down.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.677
Are you sure you're a Park?

10:09.710 --> 10:11.244
(CHUCKLES)

10:17.885 --> 10:19.119
So how are you feeling?

10:19.152 --> 10:20.253
Okay.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.123
The makeup lady said
I have an oily T-zone.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.858
Guess I can't
un-hear that.

10:26.559 --> 10:27.828
They have Oreos over here.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.362
I can make you
a bowl of middles.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.032
I'm too nervous
to eat right now.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.802
Whoa.
Red flag.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.771
You know what, buddy?
If you want to back out,
that's fine.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.272
Don't be silly.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.074
You're gonna do great.

10:41.108 --> 10:43.210
Ken, can I have a word?

10:43.243 --> 10:44.745
Dave, do your
breathing exercises.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.914
(INHALES SHARPLY)

10:46.947 --> 10:48.215
Mouth closed.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.086
What are you doing?
He's freaking out!

10:53.120 --> 10:54.387
Have you ever seen
four feet of daylight

10:54.421 --> 10:56.056
between him
and a deviled egg?

10:57.090 --> 10:58.859
He's just nervous,
which is natural.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.193
Well, I don't think
we should be pushing him

11:00.227 --> 11:01.461
if he doesn't want
to do it.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.896
He does want to do it.
(SIGHS)

11:02.930 --> 11:05.665
I'm telling you,
it's good for him to
face a challenge.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.868
And who knows?
They might love his idea.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.636
Oh, come on, Allison.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.404
Sprinkle your fairy dust
someplace else.

11:11.438 --> 11:12.639
You know how this
is gonna go.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.975
No, but I do know
we need to support

11:15.008 --> 11:17.144
and believe in him
no matter what.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.712
And if you don't get that,

11:18.746 --> 11:20.547
then you are
the meanest Shark of all.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.451
Okay, Ken and Allison Park?
Dave is up next.

11:24.484 --> 11:25.753
Yeah.
He's right over, uh...

11:27.354 --> 11:28.655
Where'd he go?

11:28.688 --> 11:29.823
Dave?

11:29.857 --> 11:31.091
Dave?

11:31.124 --> 11:32.359
He's gone.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.626
We got a runner.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.501
So, every receipt

11:41.534 --> 11:43.904
has been cross referenced
by date and category,

11:43.937 --> 11:46.840
and I saved you $12,000
in deductions.

11:46.874 --> 11:50.377
This is brilliant.
You've really gone
above and beyond here.

11:50.410 --> 11:54.014
And, as promised,
a letter of recommendation.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.916
(CHUCKLES) May I?
Mm-hmm.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.251
"Dear Admissions Department,
It's my pleasure to recommend

11:58.285 --> 12:00.553
"a wonderfully bright
young woman,

12:00.587 --> 12:04.724
"provided this California
girl can brave the harsh
Connecticut winters."

12:05.759 --> 12:07.094
Wait. What?

12:07.127 --> 12:09.930
"As someone who's been there,
I can say that Molly Park

12:09.963 --> 12:12.833
"has what it takes
to be a Fightin' Bullfrog."

12:14.301 --> 12:16.303
Wait. I'm sorry.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.872
Did you go
to Stanford University
in California?

12:18.906 --> 12:21.574
(LAUGHING) What?
Oh, God, no.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.912
I could never get in there
in a million years.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.149
No, I went to
Stamford Community College

12:29.182 --> 12:30.984
in Stamford, Connecticut.

12:32.385 --> 12:33.921
But you said you graduated
in three years.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.956
Yeah, I know
it's a two-year school,

12:35.989 --> 12:39.927
but I don't know,
I guess I was just
having too much fun.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.629
But what about working
at the tech startup
in Silicon Valley?

12:42.662 --> 12:44.798
Yeah, I managed
a Circuit City in
Menlo Park

12:44.832 --> 12:46.399
right when it opened.

12:50.637 --> 12:51.972
Oh, boy.

12:53.506 --> 12:56.376
Oh, boy. I think I...
Oh, I know what happened.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.311
Oh. I'm so sorry.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.913
This was
an honest mistake.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.282
Oh, my gosh.
I just feel awful.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.151
You must
just be devastated.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.585
(SIGHS)
Ah.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.054
Well, I have to admit,
I was a little curious

13:07.087 --> 13:08.755
as to why you wanted
a letter of recommendation

13:08.788 --> 13:11.158
for a school
with a 100%
acceptance rate.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.030
DR. KEN: Dave?

13:17.364 --> 13:18.465
Dave?

13:23.803 --> 13:24.872
Hey, buddy.

13:28.508 --> 13:29.709
I can't do it.

13:29.742 --> 13:31.744
You were right, Dad.
We should go home.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.082
You know what?

13:35.748 --> 13:37.484
No.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.153
You want this,
and you can do it.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.654
Well,
what if I screw up?

13:41.688 --> 13:42.990
Then I won't love you.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.161
Look, when I was your age,
I made a volcano
for the science fair,

13:48.195 --> 13:49.796
and it was a disaster.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.632
But your mom helped me
realize it was a good thing

13:52.665 --> 13:54.567
because, just like you,

13:54.601 --> 13:57.337
I wanted to take it up
a notch and put myself
out there.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.771
And I did.

13:58.805 --> 14:01.641
And I didn't have half
the talent and charisma
that you have.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.511
Dave, you're gonna
crush this.

14:04.544 --> 14:05.712
I believe in you.

14:08.715 --> 14:09.950
It's now or never, guys.

14:11.751 --> 14:12.986
I don't know.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.354
What if I went up there
with you?

14:14.888 --> 14:15.989
You'd do that?

14:16.023 --> 14:19.859
You bet, buddy.
We win or lose together.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.995
All right.
Let's go, Dad.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.664
I suddenly have a taste
for shark meat.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.999
(LAUGHS)

14:36.343 --> 14:38.979
Ooh. Mol,
something wrong?

14:39.012 --> 14:41.748
Oh, it's nothing. I'm just
a little disappointed.

14:41.781 --> 14:43.583
Yeah, a lot of that
going around.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.320
Will you let it go?
Let what go?

14:47.354 --> 14:49.022
(SLAPS DESK)
Okay, fine.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.591
The other day,
I posted a picture of me
and Connor hiking,

14:51.624 --> 14:54.427
and you didn't like it.
I mean, I don't know
if you liked it,

14:54.461 --> 14:55.996
but you didn't like it.
Clark, I did like it.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.297
I didn't like it,
but I liked it.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.867
Well, if you liked it,
then how come
you didn't like it?

15:00.900 --> 15:04.204
That was the first time
you ever posted a picture
of you with Connor, right?

15:04.237 --> 15:05.405
Yeah.

15:05.438 --> 15:08.108
Well, I thought that deserved
more than just a like,

15:09.909 --> 15:12.079
so I got you this.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.783
Sorry. The framing
took a little longer than
I expected.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.118
(INHALES DEEPLY)

15:18.151 --> 15:19.686
(VOICE BREAKING)
So many feelings.

15:21.888 --> 15:23.256
Damn. She's good.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.026
Like.

15:26.559 --> 15:27.560
Like.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.163
Like.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.600
Hey, young Park.

15:35.102 --> 15:38.271
You know,
I want to apologize again
for the confusion earlier.

15:38.305 --> 15:41.274
You know, the whole
Stamford/Stanford thing.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.677
Hey, you know who'd get
a real kick out of this

15:44.711 --> 15:46.313
is my best friend
from high school, Curt.

15:46.346 --> 15:47.847
Why?

15:47.880 --> 15:50.250
Well, he's the Dean
of Admissions at Stanford.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.955
The Dean of Admissions
at actual Stanford?

15:55.989 --> 15:58.425
Like, Stanford with an "N?"

15:58.458 --> 16:00.827
Yeah. Small world, huh?
(CHUCKLES)

16:01.794 --> 16:04.431
Well, maybe you could...

16:04.464 --> 16:06.466
Put in a good word for you.
Of course.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.768
Yes. I'll do that
first thing in the morning.
I'll call Curt.

16:08.801 --> 16:09.936
Thank you so much!

16:10.870 --> 16:12.239
Oh. Well...

16:12.839 --> 16:14.007
Hmm.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.777
Hey, you know if it, uh,
doesn't work out,

16:17.810 --> 16:20.247
I've sent the letter
to Stamford with an "M."

16:21.648 --> 16:23.850
Congratulations!
You're already accepted.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.070
Hello, Sharks.

16:43.103 --> 16:46.139
I'm Dave Park, and I'm a kid
and an entrepreneur.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.507
A kid-trepreneur!

16:48.508 --> 16:50.110
How many of you have had
your sleep

16:50.143 --> 16:52.312
constantly interrupted
by your hot legs?

16:54.581 --> 16:56.483
That's what I was hoping
you'd say!

16:56.516 --> 16:58.051
(CHUCKLES)

16:58.085 --> 17:00.787
Well, have I got
the product for you.

17:00.820 --> 17:04.524
Meet the Hot Legs Duvet.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.595
(LAUGHTER)

17:10.263 --> 17:12.832
It's like pair of shorts
and a blanket had a baby

17:12.865 --> 17:14.801
and they called it
"Refreshing!"

17:14.834 --> 17:16.136
(LAUGHS)

17:16.169 --> 17:19.606
Plus, it's father and doctor
approved.

17:19.639 --> 17:20.873
That's right.

17:20.907 --> 17:23.476
One out of one doctor
surveyed recommended it.

17:24.311 --> 17:26.746
I'm a doctor
and his father.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.048
Yeah. I think
we've established
that already.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.450
(LAUGHS)

17:30.483 --> 17:33.886
Now, who wants to cuddle up
and make the magic happen?

17:33.920 --> 17:35.355
You have some samples?
Oh.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.889
There you go.
Yeah.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.327
All right.
Give one to Lori.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.594
There you go, Lori.
LORI: Thank you.

17:41.628 --> 17:42.929
Thank you.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.265
Um, Dave, thank you.

17:45.998 --> 17:47.234
I'm out.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.336
I'm out.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.503
Come on, girl!

17:50.537 --> 17:51.771
Yeah, I'm out, too.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.340
Hey, I thought we were boys,
Fubu!

17:54.307 --> 17:55.908
(LIGHT LAUGHTER)

17:55.942 --> 17:57.944
It looks like you just cut
two holes into a blanket.

17:57.977 --> 17:59.412
That's right, Mark Cuban.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.382
So why wouldn't I just do
the same thing?

18:02.949 --> 18:04.151
Well...

18:06.085 --> 18:07.720
you'd need
a good pair of scissors.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.456
How many have you sold?

18:09.489 --> 18:11.158
Counting
internationally?
Yep.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.459
Zero.

18:12.492 --> 18:15.562
I'm going to stop you
right there, kid.
I'm out.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.765
Listen, kid,
I'm going to say something
I've never said before.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.233
"Dave Park's
a blanket wizard"?

18:20.267 --> 18:23.336
No. Just looking at
that product gives me
a nightmare.

18:23.370 --> 18:25.205
This is a dog.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.406
I'm so out,

18:26.439 --> 18:28.575
and you, kid,
you're dead to me.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.010
Thank you, Sharks.

18:35.582 --> 18:36.883
How dare you?

18:36.916 --> 18:38.885
This product is a dog.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.887
You should take it behind
the barn and shoot it.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.723
I hope you drown in a pool
of your own leg sweat.

18:43.756 --> 18:44.891
If you brought this
to market,

18:44.924 --> 18:46.493
you'd get crushed
like a cockroach.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.228
I'm the only one telling you
the truth here.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.263
That's why they call me
Mr. Wonderful.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.299
Now you've got the truth.
Get out of here.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.367
A blanket with two holes.

18:54.401 --> 18:55.935
A rag.
You're wearing a rag!

19:00.407 --> 19:02.775
Oh, God, you were right.
That was a disaster.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.444
I know. I was there.
(SIGHS)

19:07.814 --> 19:09.816
Hey, Dave.
I'm sorry.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.918
About what?
That was so much fun!

19:13.453 --> 19:16.256
I haggled with the Sharks,
went toe-to-toe with Cuban,

19:16.289 --> 19:19.025
Mr. Wonderful
even catchphrased me!

19:19.058 --> 19:21.594
And you're not disappointed
that they didn't like
your invention?

19:21.628 --> 19:23.430
I've got plenty
of ideas, Mom.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.097
Besides,
let's not kid ourselves.

19:25.131 --> 19:26.466
It's just holes
in a blanket.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.170
Well,
I'm just glad you're okay.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.673
Okay?
I'm fantastic!

19:33.706 --> 19:35.575
We're so proud of you.
(CHUCKLES)

19:36.376 --> 19:38.645
Hey, kid.
Nice job out there.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.380
You know,
today wasn't your day,

19:40.413 --> 19:42.515
but you've got a good head
on your shoulders.
Don't give up, okay?

19:42.549 --> 19:44.050
I won't, Mark Cuban!

19:44.083 --> 19:45.518
That's awesome.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.220
I won't give up either,
Mark Cuban!

19:50.890 --> 19:52.325
Praise from Caesar!

19:52.359 --> 19:54.694
This calls for some
celebratory deviled eggs!

19:58.431 --> 19:59.732
(SIGHS)

19:59.766 --> 20:01.501
Kid's gonna be all right.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.902
Oh.
And Molly, too.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.337
She texted
that Pat might get her

20:04.371 --> 20:06.406
a recommendation
to Stanford.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.641
Community college?
Let's hope she never
needs it.

20:11.378 --> 20:14.113
Thanks for pushing, Al.
You made this happen.

20:14.146 --> 20:15.214
Hmm.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.751
Now, what do you say
we all hop in the car

20:18.785 --> 20:20.587
and head back
to the Park Tank?

20:21.454 --> 20:22.489
I'm out.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.462
Hello, Sharks!

20:29.496 --> 20:30.930
(IMITATING DOG BARKING)

20:33.333 --> 20:34.567
Okay.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.269
How many of you have said
to yourself,

20:36.303 --> 20:40.039
"This drink coaster
isn't big enough,

20:40.072 --> 20:41.574
"isn't soft enough"?

20:41.608 --> 20:42.775
I'm looking at you, Lori.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.678
Mmm! Hmm.

20:47.146 --> 20:50.350
Well, feast your eye buds
on this.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.219
The Omni Coaster.

20:53.252 --> 20:58.224
The world's softest,
most absorbent
drink coaster.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.827
Aren't those the cutouts
from those stupid blankets
we saw?

21:00.860 --> 21:03.330
Hmm. Wonderful eye,
Mr. Wonderful.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.597
I can tell you're interested.

21:04.631 --> 21:07.300
I'm out. This time
with extreme prejudice.

21:07.334 --> 21:10.470
Okay, well, uh, how about
a softer and safer Frisbee?

21:10.503 --> 21:11.671
Cuban!

21:14.507 --> 21:15.842
Is anybody interested?

21:15.875 --> 21:17.544
ALL: No. No.
Bye.

21:17.577 --> 21:18.745
Bye.
You're out of here.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.112
So I'll see ya. Bye.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.482
Oh, did you call me back in?

21:22.515 --> 21:23.583
Bye!
DR. KEN: Okay.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.053
I'm sorry. Did you...
Did you call me?

21:27.086 --> 21:28.455
MARK: Bye!
Okay. All right.
