WEBVTT

00:06.807 --> 00:08.376
Ken, hurry up!

00:08.442 --> 00:10.678
This is why I wanted
to check luggage.

00:10.744 --> 00:14.282
I'm trying to save money,
unlike Imelda Marcos
over here,

00:14.348 --> 00:17.051
who insisted on upgrading
to a fancy rental car.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.453
The first one
they showed us
had no seat belts.

00:21.589 --> 00:24.558
Hey! You made me spill
my macadamia nuts!

00:24.625 --> 00:25.926
It's your fault.

00:25.993 --> 00:28.462
When someone's text-walking,
they have the right-of-way

00:28.529 --> 00:30.464
'cause they can't
see you.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.633
Typical mainlander.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.235
WOMAN: (OVER PA)
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:34.302 --> 00:36.537
Hawaiian Star Airlines
flight 358 to Los Angeles

00:36.604 --> 00:39.540
will now be delayed
approximately three hours.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.542
Oh, no!
Are you
kidding me?

00:45.213 --> 00:47.181
(GROANS)

00:47.248 --> 00:49.517
Oh, I guess I'm
stuck in this seat
for three hours.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.819
Oh, my God, no seat belt.
Hope I don't fall out.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.789
Speaking of seats,
ours are messed up.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.091
You said you were
gonna check them.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.926
In my defense,
I didn't check them.

00:58.992 --> 01:01.429
Okay. Just saying
'in my defense'
is not a defense.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.197
In my defense,
I thought it was.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.665
(SIGHS)

01:04.732 --> 01:05.966
There's only three
of them together.

01:06.033 --> 01:07.768
The fourth one's
like 20 rows back.

01:07.835 --> 01:10.171
I'll just hit the desk
when the line dies down

01:10.238 --> 01:12.840
and take care of
"Uh-binness."

01:14.041 --> 01:15.876
Can you just say it
like a normal person?

01:15.943 --> 01:17.478
I could if I wanted
to pop less.

01:19.347 --> 01:20.481
Ugh!
What's wrong?

01:20.548 --> 01:22.750
Trevor still hasn't
texted me back.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.418
It's been, like,
forever.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.887
Well, maybe that's because
he's not a nice person

01:26.954 --> 01:28.189
and doesn't deserve you.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.023
Why are you guys
so hard on Trevor?

01:30.090 --> 01:32.326
Because he's
not a nice person and
doesn't deserve you.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.129
Hey. It's Molly's life.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.797
She can date
whoever she wants...

01:36.864 --> 01:38.599
Even a guy who
thought it was okay

01:38.666 --> 01:40.534
to come
and meet her parents
wearing flip-flops.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.136
Exactly.

01:42.203 --> 01:45.906
Flip-flops are basically
the 'screw you' of footwear.

01:45.973 --> 01:48.376
Yeah, right back
at you, buddy!

01:48.442 --> 01:50.244
Even if Trevor
does text me back,

01:50.311 --> 01:51.379
I'm not gonna
get to see him.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.248
I'm gonna die
in this stupid airport.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.949
I'm gonna
take a walk.

01:56.016 --> 01:57.751
Good idea, Dave.
Get some exercise.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.020
Can I have money
for two Cinnabons?

02:00.087 --> 02:01.855
Aww, that's sweet.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.591
A cinny-b for
your old man.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.860
No, one to eat there
and a roadie for the
walk back.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.539
Sir, everybody,
please have patience.
We'll be right with you.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.941
Man, sick people
make me sick!

02:22.910 --> 02:25.513
What is going on?
The waiting room
is packed.

02:25.579 --> 02:26.647
It's Black Monday.

02:26.714 --> 02:29.283
Oh. Best wishes!

02:31.252 --> 02:33.821
No! Black Monday
is the first day back
after the holidays.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.823
It's the busiest
day of the year.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.458
(MOCKING)
"Best wishes."

02:39.660 --> 02:41.462
It's the height
of flu season.

02:41.529 --> 02:42.763
It's my least
favorite season.

02:42.830 --> 02:46.267
I love the smell of sick
people in the morning.

02:48.502 --> 02:51.071
Actually,
they smell horrible.

02:51.138 --> 02:53.307
That was just an homage
to my favorite dramedy.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.676
Apocalypse Now
is a dramedy?

02:55.743 --> 02:57.411
Oh, yeah, there's
some drama in there.

02:57.478 --> 02:58.712
It's not all laughs.

03:01.482 --> 03:04.151
Anyway, we've got a ton
of patients out there

03:04.218 --> 03:06.687
in need of our care
and compassion,

03:06.754 --> 03:08.155
so let's move that meat.

03:09.623 --> 03:10.758
Where's Dr. Park?

03:10.824 --> 03:12.693
Oh, he's still in Hawaii.

03:12.760 --> 03:13.927
Yeah, and the
backup doctor,

03:13.994 --> 03:15.829
Dr. Nayak,
is out with the flu.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.965
Oh, my God,
it's the perfect storm.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.468
Ah, The Perfect Storm.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.836
That is my second
favorite buddy comedy.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.272
What's your favorite?

03:24.338 --> 03:25.773
The Usual Suspects.

03:25.839 --> 03:29.277
(CHUCKLING) Yeah, just six...
Six buddies out on a lark.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.314
So, for today,
Dr. Dobbs,

03:33.381 --> 03:34.748
you are the
physician in charge.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.052
So, my first day
as lead physician

03:39.119 --> 03:40.521
is on Black Monday?

03:40.588 --> 03:42.856
Oh, God help us.

03:44.157 --> 03:45.426
Oh, not 'cause of you.

03:45.493 --> 03:48.028
That's just something
we say on Black Monday.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.763
Clark, can I get an amen?

03:51.899 --> 03:53.133
Not for lying.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.040
Ugh!

04:00.107 --> 04:01.342
Still nothing
from Trevor,

04:01.409 --> 04:03.243
and I only have
3% battery left.

04:03.311 --> 04:06.013
Aw. I'm only
3% interested.

04:07.515 --> 04:09.683
I'm gonna just give you
one big eye roll

04:09.750 --> 04:11.385
to cover me for
the rest of the day.

04:13.921 --> 04:14.955
(HISSES)

04:16.056 --> 04:17.525
If I get a text,
come get me.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.193
I'll be buying magazines
like someone from the '50s.

04:22.195 --> 04:23.397
(CHUCKLES) She
thinks you're old.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.267
Oh, look,
there's no line.

04:27.335 --> 04:30.137
Ooh. I know exactly
how to handle this.

04:31.505 --> 04:32.806
What are you doing?

04:32.873 --> 04:34.141
I'm getting us all
seats together

04:34.207 --> 04:35.743
and probably
some drink vouchers.

04:35.809 --> 04:36.910
Ken, that never works.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.513
It got me $5 off
my tire rotation.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.285
Oh, look, it's Dr. Oz.
I love that guy.

04:45.353 --> 04:46.987
(GASPS) Me, too.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.689
Ooh, he's so handsome.

04:48.756 --> 04:51.392
Whoa, whoa,
put it back in your
mom jeans, all right?

04:51.459 --> 04:52.626
I should go say hello.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.127
Say hello?
You don't know him.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.563
Eh, we're both doctors.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.465
It's like how Prius owners
always honk at each other.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.436
Mom, those college kids
are playing cards,

05:02.503 --> 05:03.837
and they invited
me to play.

05:03.904 --> 05:04.938
That's nice, honey.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.575
The buy-in is $20.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.843
Dave, I don't think
you should be gambling
with strangers.

05:09.910 --> 05:12.179
Yeah, you're right.

05:12.245 --> 05:14.548
Want to help me
finish my travel essay
about our trip?

05:14.615 --> 05:18.051
I'm gonna call it
'Hawaii Five-0,
What A Wonderful Time.'

05:18.886 --> 05:20.053
Here's $40.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.855
If you take a bad beat,
you could buy back in.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.694
Well, thank you
for watching.
It means a lot.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.929
All right,
move it along.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.831
Huzzah, huzzah.
(CHUCKLES)

05:30.898 --> 05:33.401
He's a very busy man.
He doesn't want
to be bothered.

05:33.467 --> 05:34.735
(CHUCKLING)
Geez.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.236
People don't respect
your space, huh?

05:36.303 --> 05:39.072
Big smile.
(LAUGHS)

05:39.139 --> 05:40.207
Give me your number.
I'll text it to you.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.308
No, that's okay.
Thank you.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.677
Dr. Ken park, MD.

05:43.744 --> 05:47.014
Just wanted to say 'sup,
you know, doc to doc.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.082
Oh, well, 'sup.
Say, have a great flight.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.284
Ooh! Got the
new 8, huh?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.787
Me, too. Thing's
amazing, isn't it?

05:53.854 --> 05:55.222
Yeah, it's great.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.090
I, uh... I use it to get
a lot of work done, so...

05:57.157 --> 05:59.159
(CHUCKLES)
By the way,
I dig your show,

05:59.226 --> 06:01.328
and my wife
thinks you're hot,
so back off!

06:01.395 --> 06:03.330
(CHUCKLES)
Will do.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.866
Ooh, what if there's
a medical emergency
on the flight?

06:05.933 --> 06:08.335
Hey, maybe you
and I can double team
a trach on a choker.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.538
Wouldn't that be tight?

06:10.604 --> 06:12.039
You don't really
sound like a doctor.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.373
Word.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.342
I got a lot
of stuff to do.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.910
I'll bet. Listen,

06:16.977 --> 06:18.579
I'm gonna give you
a little freebie here.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.848
I love your hard-hitting
medical stuff,

06:20.914 --> 06:22.149
but some of the
lighter bits,

06:22.215 --> 06:23.584
like when you had
the audience

06:23.651 --> 06:26.554
all check their underwear?
(INHALES SHARPLY) Not my fave.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.988
You know,
I put in different
kinds of segments

06:28.055 --> 06:29.256
in order to
please everybody.

06:29.322 --> 06:30.858
Well, it did not
please me.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.026
Yeah, I got that
from 'not my fave.'

06:33.093 --> 06:34.995
Whoa, whoa, dude,
take a knee.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.130
I'm just trying
to help you out here.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.532
(CHUCKLES)
I get it.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.434
My sister is one
of you people.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.503
A Turkish American?

06:42.570 --> 06:45.172
No. She's a TV doctor.
Dr. Wendi.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.240
And your show
is even better than hers.

06:47.307 --> 06:50.243
And you have
a gorgeous head
of TV hair.

06:50.310 --> 06:53.514
Just lay off the undies.
That's all I'm sayin'.

06:53.581 --> 06:55.248
You know, people learn
a lot about their health

06:55.315 --> 06:56.684
from checking
their underwear.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.853
Yeah, but since that aired,
I've had a parade of patients

06:59.920 --> 07:01.388
waving their skivvies
in front of me

07:01.455 --> 07:04.057
like some sort of
crusty flag...

07:04.124 --> 07:06.359
Except it's not a flag,
it's dirty undies,

07:06.426 --> 07:09.062
which is pretty rough
on a Monday, you feel me?

07:09.129 --> 07:10.230
You know what?
I don't feel you.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.265
What I am feeling is
you're sort of a jerk.

07:12.332 --> 07:15.102
Seriously? That's how
you treat a medical peer?

07:15.168 --> 07:16.770
You're not my peer.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.105
You're some
stranger who accosted
me in the airport

07:18.171 --> 07:19.740
and starting criticizing
my work.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.475
You know,
I'm starting to doubt
that you're even a doctor.

07:21.542 --> 07:24.211
You sound more like you're
some '90s hip-hop wannabe.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.680
Aw, snap!
That's cold, G!

07:26.747 --> 07:28.816
Homey, don't play that!

07:28.882 --> 07:30.484
Go away.
I'm going.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.252
Good.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.661
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

07:40.728 --> 07:42.730
Okay, Dr. Dobbs,
friendly reminder

07:42.796 --> 07:44.932
that we are officially
way behind

07:44.998 --> 07:49.369
and you are heading
into hour number two
with Mrs. Heller.

07:49.436 --> 07:53.607
I was just asking her
about her 1990 knee surgery.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.676
I wouldn't want
to overlook anything.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.911
Like the fact
that she probably
has the flu?

07:57.978 --> 08:00.748
Or that
everyone in her
family has the flu?

08:02.082 --> 08:04.451
Or that, in her own words,
"I know my body,

08:04.518 --> 08:06.086
"and I know
I have the flu"?

08:09.823 --> 08:11.024
Is she through
with Mrs. Heller?

08:11.091 --> 08:12.893
"Is she through
with Mrs. Heller?"

08:14.427 --> 08:16.730
"Is she through
with Mrs. Heller?"

08:16.797 --> 08:19.600
She's not even through
1990 with Mrs. Heller!

08:22.903 --> 08:24.137
Okay, okay.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.539
(WHIMPERING)
Hey.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.407
Hey, Pat, man,
you got to do something.

08:27.474 --> 08:29.042
I've got 100 people
in the waiting room

08:29.109 --> 08:31.912
passing germs around
like the LA damn Clippers!

08:33.313 --> 08:34.648
I am way ahead of you.

08:34.715 --> 08:35.783
What you gonna do?

08:35.849 --> 08:37.851
I'm preparing
to make a killing.

08:37.918 --> 08:41.288
When life gives you phlegm,
you make "phlegm-onade."

08:43.456 --> 08:45.125
Juan-Julio,
have you had
your flu shot?

08:45.192 --> 08:46.660
No.
That's a shame.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.095
We're going in.

08:49.997 --> 08:52.399
Candy bars!
Popcorn! Soda!

08:52.465 --> 08:53.701
You can pay
cash, credit,

08:53.767 --> 08:55.168
or put it on your
Welltopia card.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.437
That's our preference.
Don't touch me!

09:03.644 --> 09:05.746
Hi. My family's seats
got messed up,

09:05.813 --> 09:06.947
and I need to get
them all together.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.015
Can you help me out?

09:08.081 --> 09:10.417
Oh, I don't think so.

09:11.819 --> 09:14.021
Oh, oh, come on.
I'm sure you understand.

19:20.126 --> 19:21.994
if you have the
charger for the new 8.

19:22.061 --> 19:25.332
Well, well, well. Hmm.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.334
Well, well, well, well.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.001
Can I use the
charger or not?

19:29.068 --> 19:32.138
If there was only something
I needed that you have.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.541
Fine. I'll switch
seats with you.

19:34.607 --> 19:35.642
And?

19:37.009 --> 19:38.144
I'll pay for
your dumb hat.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.413
That's how we do.

19:43.716 --> 19:44.784
Come on.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.753
Daddy needs
a new pair of shoes.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.621
I actually do.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.156
The Velcro is shot
on these things.

19:53.893 --> 19:57.364
Guess who
just talked Dr. Oz
into swapping.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.066
Ah. Well,
he is handsome.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.268
Seats, Allison. Seats.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.936
Oh, cool, cool, cool.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.239
(OVER PA)
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.107
Flight 358 with
service to Los Angeles

20:08.174 --> 20:09.509
will now
begin boarding.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.143
Yes!
Yes!

20:11.911 --> 20:12.979
Dave, let's go!

20:13.045 --> 20:14.447
Cash out!
Okay!

20:14.514 --> 20:16.048
My dad's calling me.

20:16.115 --> 20:18.485
So, as the
considerate man
says to the toilet,

20:18.551 --> 20:20.320
I leave you
with a flush.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.091
Pleasure doing business
with you, fellas.

20:25.157 --> 20:26.959
Good luck back
at Arizona State.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.995
Got to say,
I thought a party school

20:29.061 --> 20:30.830
would have had
better poker players.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.910
Hey, have fun
in 32-A.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.912
I'll see you
on my way back
to the bathroom

20:45.978 --> 20:48.348
because your seat is
'a-bathroom' adjacent.

20:48.415 --> 20:49.682
(LAUGHS)

20:50.517 --> 20:51.651
Uh, excuse me.

20:51.718 --> 20:52.985
Aren't we limited
to two carry-ons?

20:53.052 --> 20:54.387
'Cause he's got
like nine.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.357
Thank you, Dr. Oz.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.925
You're gonna have
to check them.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.460
Oh, and I'll need
a credit card

21:00.527 --> 21:02.529
for the numerous
baggage fees.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.132
That's how we do.

21:06.198 --> 21:07.400
(SCANNER BEEPS)

21:07.467 --> 21:08.935
While you're checking
all that baggage,

21:09.001 --> 21:10.202
check your underwear.

21:12.639 --> 21:15.342
Here you go, dad.
For the baggage fees.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.778
And this is for you.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.246
Get yourself
something nice.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.181
