12:29.291 --> 12:30.622
and a birthright.

12:30.751 --> 12:34.209
lt designates me to be protector
of troubled people.

12:34.338 --> 12:35.828
That's why you're
the leader of The Guard.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.750
That's my sacred duty.

12:37.883 --> 12:40.841
Okay, but your symbol
blinks in rhythm with this book

12:40.969 --> 12:43.802
like you're supposed to show us
the heart of Haven,

12:43.931 --> 12:44.920
and you have no idea?

12:45.057 --> 12:45.887
No.

12:48.310 --> 12:49.595
Unless...

12:52.314 --> 12:54.225
What if I'm the heart of Haven?

12:54.358 --> 12:58.271
Oh, please. Does your egotism
know no bounds?

12:58.403 --> 12:59.609
Hang on.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.736
It's not a bad question.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.024
Jennifer?

13:05.160 --> 13:09.199
If he was, I think I'd have a new set
of instructions by now, but...

13:09.331 --> 13:10.491
no luck.

13:11.959 --> 13:16.328
So what kind of birthmark
does the second born get?

13:16.463 --> 13:18.795
Oh...

13:19.591 --> 13:20.967
l have no Teagues blood.

13:21.093 --> 13:23.459
Like you, l was adopted.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.517
Well, that explains a lot.

13:29.851 --> 13:33.184
All right, so the woman at the park
was about 50 feet from the baby.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.520
But the tennis player
was six miles away.

13:35.649 --> 13:39.312
Other victims spread around,
near or far.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.435
The more information we get,
the more random it looks.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.823
There has to be a pattern.
We just haven't seen it yet.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.689
There isn't. Believe me.
Oh, Benny.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.691
God, Benny, I'm sorry.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.443
Hi, Mom.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.202
You're Ben's mom?

13:51.331 --> 13:54.368
Step—mom. l was married
to Ben Sr. for 20 years,

13:54.501 --> 13:56.366
God rest his soul.

13:56.503 --> 14:00.371
Gloria raised me, and she's been
an amazing grandma to Aaron.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.668
So you know
about the Harker family curse?

14:02.801 --> 14:04.211
You think marriage is tough

14:04.344 --> 14:08.883
until you fall for a guy
who can't allow himself to cry.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.974
It brings new meaning
to "emotionally unavailable."

14:12.644 --> 14:14.430
Now, how can you be so sure
there's no pattern?

14:14.563 --> 14:16.224
There's got to be
some way to stop this.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.063
Oh, I've been here before.
I tried to figure this out.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.309
I didn't want to have
to teach Ben to never cry.

14:22.446 --> 14:24.357
So you researched
the Harker family trouble?

14:24.489 --> 14:28.323
Yeah, we laid into the history.
We went back as far as we could.

14:28.452 --> 14:31.444
We worked nights, weekends
for years to find a way.

14:31.580 --> 14:32.820
It's a dead end.

14:32.956 --> 14:36.244
Every trouble has rules,
some connection.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.412
There —— there has got to be
some sort of logic.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.206
The logic on this one is brutal.

14:40.338 --> 14:43.000
Victims die randomly and in droves.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.749
It hasn't been this ugly since 1901.

14:45.886 --> 14:48.673
Hundreds —— hundreds of people
died in Haven

14:48.805 --> 14:50.261
and the surrounding counties.

14:50.390 --> 14:54.599
The old Herald had to run
a bogus story on Spanish influenza.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.935
Okay, but it stopped.
Somebody stopped it.

14:57.064 --> 14:59.726
Yeah.
I'll give you one guess how.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.766
They killed a troubled person.

15:03.987 --> 15:07.275
You show me somebody who has
the heart to murder a baby,

15:07.407 --> 15:09.614
and they're gonna have to go
through me first.

15:09.743 --> 15:13.452
So you know what? Just, like, rev up
your trouble—solving machine,

15:13.580 --> 15:14.569
or whatever she is,

15:14.706 --> 15:18.745
and just find a way
to save my grandson!

15:20.587 --> 15:24.796
William says that you need
to give someone a silence trouble

15:24.925 --> 15:27.291
to neutralize
the baby's deadly cries,

15:27.427 --> 15:28.803
but, no, Gloria's right.

15:28.929 --> 15:32.342
You are a trouble solver.

15:32.474 --> 15:34.510
You're immune.

15:38.063 --> 15:41.806
So what happens if I hold the baby
the next time he cries?

15:41.942 --> 15:43.603
Exactly.

15:45.403 --> 15:46.734
[Baby fussing]

15:48.615 --> 15:49.980
He does that when he's tired.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.449
He usually cries
right before he falls asleep.

15:52.577 --> 15:55.569
It's okay, Aaron.
You don't have to cry.

15:55.705 --> 15:56.831
You're gonna be safe.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.664
[Baby crying]

16:07.968 --> 16:09.959
Ashley? Ashley?

16:10.887 --> 16:12.798
Oh, my God, Ashley!

16:20.313 --> 16:25.478
My wife is gone,
and I can't cry.

16:25.610 --> 16:28.317
Tell me what to do.

16:29.030 --> 16:32.522
I need something to do.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.492
You stay strong for your son.

16:46.882 --> 16:50.045
Well, it, uh, looks like
her heart just stopped...

16:50.177 --> 16:52.589
—[ Cell phones ring]
—...simi|ar to the others.

16:56.099 --> 16:58.465
The baby's cries killed two people ——

16:58.602 --> 17:01.264
his mother and some guy
in a warehouse across town.

17:01.396 --> 17:03.887
Listen, Gloria, just let us
get somebody to cover for you.

17:04.024 --> 17:05.560
There's no time for that.
I'll do it.

17:05.692 --> 17:06.807
There's too much to take care of.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.355
I'm here to take care of you.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.864
I'm scared.
I'm really scared.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.605
—In the good ear, love.
—Oh.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.570
I'm afraid we're gonna lose him.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.364
I know.
I know, I know, I know.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.408
Lincoln —— Gloria's worse half.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.530
Nice to meet you.

17:23.543 --> 17:26.626
I think the baby could use
some Grandpa Lincoln time, okay?

17:26.755 --> 17:27.995
Yeah, all right, honey.

17:28.131 --> 17:29.837
So he knows about the...

17:30.592 --> 17:31.707
The troubles?

17:31.843 --> 17:34.835
Hard to live with Gloria
doing what she does and not know.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.962
To think I lived in Haven
for 60 years

17:37.098 --> 17:38.759
before I discovered its secret.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.257
I'll go sit with Ben, hmm?

17:40.393 --> 17:43.226
—I love you. Thanks.
—Mm—hmm.

17:45.106 --> 17:48.519
Ben thinks we have about 1.5 hours
till the baby wakes up.

17:48.652 --> 17:50.313
All right, listen,
I'm gonna go down to the Herald.

17:50.445 --> 17:52.151
I'm gonna take a fresh look
at the archives

17:52.280 --> 17:53.656
and see if there's
some kind of pattern

17:53.782 --> 17:55.238
that you may have missed, Gloria.

17:55.367 --> 17:56.197
Maybe with the new D.O.A.,

17:56.326 --> 17:58.032
we can find
some sort of connection.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.197
Well, you got about 90 minutes
to prove me wrong,

18:00.330 --> 18:02.036
and I hope you guys do,

18:02.165 --> 18:06.750
or we're gonna have another plague
like 1901 on our hands.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.335
We will figure this out.

18:09.464 --> 18:11.955
I'm gonna check out the D.O.A.
at the warehouse.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.003
[Car door opens, closes]

18:14.135 --> 18:16.842
[Engine turning over]

18:18.265 --> 18:19.380
Hey,Duke.

18:28.942 --> 18:31.854
Hey.
What do we got?

18:31.987 --> 18:34.899
Huh?
I've always wanted to say that.

18:35.031 --> 18:37.693
You think killing innocent people
is funny?

18:37.826 --> 18:38.815
Oh, I'm not the murderer here.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.068
Now, I know he looks cute and all,

18:41.204 --> 18:42.489
but if you ask me,

18:42.622 --> 18:44.408
[Whispering]
I think the baby did it.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.994
[Normal voice] l was actually hoping
l'd bump into your partner here,

18:47.127 --> 18:49.083
but you can take her the message.

18:49.212 --> 18:53.205
This all stops when she makes
the right decision.

18:53.341 --> 18:55.502
The right decision?

18:55.635 --> 18:57.216
You're out of your mind.

18:57.345 --> 18:59.256
And you're out of your league.

18:59.389 --> 19:01.846
You have no idea
about the larger picture.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.465
It ——

19:05.353 --> 19:08.095
It's like trying to explain physics
to a goldfish.

19:09.316 --> 19:12.854
Now, you can do whatever you want
with Audrey Parker.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.693
Go steady, take her to the prom.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.188
I want the original.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.941
She only is...

19:21.077 --> 19:24.535
and always will be
Audrey Parker.

19:24.664 --> 19:28.953
And yet, when you shot me,
she bled.

19:29.085 --> 19:33.829
That's a level of intimacy
you can't comprehend.

19:33.965 --> 19:35.626
You don't know
the first thing about love.

19:36.176 --> 19:39.043
When I break
your connection to Audrey,

19:40.013 --> 19:44.473
I'm gonna put you in the ground,
and it will hurt.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.387
Oh.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.852
Hurt like this or like this?

19:52.567 --> 19:54.023
[Sighs]

19:54.152 --> 19:57.815
Aw, you feel me
just like you feel her.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.233
That's all you can do.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.447
You can throw punches,

20:01.576 --> 20:04.238
but you can't turn Audrey
into something she's not.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.908
Clearly she thinks I can,

20:07.040 --> 20:09.531
or she wouldn't be stalling.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.660
[Whistling]

20:15.090 --> 20:17.581
A troubled baby
whose cries kill people?

20:17.717 --> 20:19.173
That's the worst thing
I've ever heard.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.087
Yeah.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.176
Hey, go help Audrey.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.508
I'm not leaving you here alone.

20:24.641 --> 20:25.972
Alone?

20:26.101 --> 20:27.932
Half of the Haven PD. is outside,

20:28.061 --> 20:29.847
there's a getaway boat on the dock,

20:29.979 --> 20:35.099
and I have the, uh, badasses
of checkers as well.

20:38.154 --> 20:39.610
[Sighs]

20:39.739 --> 20:41.115
Look, I just don't know about this.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.653
Plus, I have this.

20:43.785 --> 20:46.492
I'll be fine.
Go help Audrey.

20:46.621 --> 20:49.078
We will look for the door here
however we can.

20:49.624 --> 20:52.957
And then maybe tomorrow
we can just have a quiet brunch,

20:53.086 --> 20:54.246
do the crossword.

20:54.379 --> 20:55.619
Whoa.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.962
If you think that we are gonna be

20:58.091 --> 21:00.707
like some flavored—coffee
commercial,

21:00.844 --> 21:03.586
you clearly don't know me.

21:04.514 --> 21:07.130
I know you, Duke.

21:14.983 --> 21:17.315
—All right.
—Okay.

21:18.319 --> 21:20.059
[Sighs]

21:31.207 --> 21:33.118
That's me.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.830
[Door opens, bells jingling]

21:38.840 --> 21:40.250
So what's so important

21:40.383 --> 21:42.624
that you couldn't tell me about it
on the phone?

21:43.303 --> 21:46.841
Gloria's right.
It's completely random.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.306
I can't stop the Harker curse.
I never could.

21:51.227 --> 21:54.094
I faced it before, and I failed.

21:54.230 --> 21:57.017
Now, in about 25 minutes,
that baby wakes up,

21:57.150 --> 21:58.640
starts killing people.

22:01.988 --> 22:06.106
All right, so the going theory
is that William's giving out troubles

22:06.242 --> 22:09.154
because he thinks
the original Audrey liked it.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.869
And he wants you to remember her.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.330
If that's true,

22:14.459 --> 22:18.498
does that mean
that you and William...

22:21.007 --> 22:23.339
Did you make the troubles
in the first place?

22:24.552 --> 22:26.417
Yes.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.804
And now he wants me
to do it again.

22:31.476 --> 22:34.593
He wants me to create
a silence trouble

22:34.729 --> 22:38.517
that will stop these deaths
and save the baby.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.561
Oh.

22:40.944 --> 22:43.811
So you called me down here
to grant you permission

22:43.947 --> 22:46.279
to give someone a trouble?

22:46.866 --> 22:49.778
Audrey, you can never do that,

22:49.911 --> 22:52.618
no matter what happens.

22:52.747 --> 22:55.955
He is trying to get you
to shove that needle

22:56.084 --> 22:57.620
back into your vein.

22:57.752 --> 22:59.288
There's no recovering from that.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.456
You don't trust me
to hold on to who I am?

23:01.589 --> 23:03.420
I don't trust the troubles.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.711
They are deep and dark,

23:05.843 --> 23:08.835
and they take
the people you love away.

23:08.972 --> 23:10.587
No one's taking Audrey away.

23:11.099 --> 23:13.636
[Door closes, bells jingling]

23:13.768 --> 23:15.724
[Sighs]
Do it.

23:15.853 --> 23:18.344
Trouble whoever you need to
to make this stop.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.646
I know you're strong enough.

23:20.775 --> 23:24.017
You're not gonna turn
into whoever William wants you to.

23:25.113 --> 23:27.024
I believe in you, Audrey...

23:28.741 --> 23:32.074
But if you turn back into some
female version of William...

23:33.663 --> 23:36.951
If that happens,
forget the troubles,

23:37.083 --> 23:38.539
forget babies that kill people.

23:38.668 --> 23:41.080
We are screwed
on a whole other level.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.507
I knew you'd come find me here.

23:52.348 --> 23:54.179
It's our place.

23:54.684 --> 23:58.097
So, you ready
to give someone a trouble?

23:58.229 --> 24:00.015
No.

24:00.148 --> 24:02.434
I've decided to kill the baby.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.730
That's not what I was expecting.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.859
Oh...

24:13.161 --> 24:14.992
You're quffing.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.112
[Chuckles]
Okay.

24:17.248 --> 24:20.706
You want to see what I'll do?
Let me be plain.

24:20.835 --> 24:22.826
The Harker clan is large.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.419
Baby Aaron has eight cousins
under the age of 10.

24:25.548 --> 24:27.709
If you kill that baby...

24:28.718 --> 24:31.960
I'll activate each and every
last one of them.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.473
And you would do it, too.

24:34.599 --> 24:38.012
Because you're important
and because I love you,

24:38.144 --> 24:41.102
I have to corner you
into making a trouble.

24:47.695 --> 24:49.560
All right...

24:51.366 --> 24:52.651
I'll do it.

24:57.705 --> 25:00.663
You have no idea
how happy this makes me.

25:00.792 --> 25:04.125
—This isn't about you.
—Oh, don't ruin the moment.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.244
Just tell me what I need to do.

25:06.964 --> 25:10.422
Giving someone a trouble
requires an alchemy of three things.

25:10.551 --> 25:14.885
First, a strong intention.
What kind of curse do you want?

25:15.014 --> 25:16.595
Use your imagination.

25:16.724 --> 25:20.216
Two, the person you choose is key.

25:20.353 --> 25:21.308
I mean, who are they?

25:21.437 --> 25:23.553
Are they a good match
for your intention?

25:23.690 --> 25:27.933
Now, the curse, or intention,
is shaped in here.

25:28.069 --> 25:31.186
You're giving them a release.
It's a gift.

25:31.322 --> 25:33.062
I'll never believe that.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.440
Yeah, you will.

25:35.576 --> 25:36.827
Finally...

25:40.498 --> 25:41.578
There's this.

25:41.708 --> 25:46.202
Think of this as the breath of life.

25:47.755 --> 25:50.963
Put it in your hand,
put your hand on a customer,

25:51.092 --> 25:53.048
and wait for the party.

25:55.096 --> 25:58.463
Intention, person...

25:58.599 --> 26:00.430
and...

26:00.560 --> 26:04.269
black ball of stuff.

26:04.397 --> 26:07.139
This is gonna be amazing.
I can't wait.

26:07.942 --> 26:09.398
You're not invited.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.517
How about a kiss for luck?

26:12.280 --> 26:14.566
Come any closer,
I'II punch you in the face.

26:15.950 --> 26:17.781
It'll be worth my own black eye.

26:24.459 --> 26:28.168
Intention, person, evil black goo ——

26:28.296 --> 26:31.254
You know, jacking up somebody's
life shouldn't be this simple.

26:31.382 --> 26:32.132
But it's not that simple.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.873
Aaron's gonna wake up and cry
at any minute,

26:34.010 --> 26:35.875
and I've got to come up
with some kind of silence trouble.

26:36.012 --> 26:38.594
What's that mean, okay?
What's my intention?

26:38.723 --> 26:41.135
The D.O.A. at the warehouse,
right before he died,

26:41.267 --> 26:43.553
he said he heard a baby cry.

26:43.686 --> 26:45.642
That's five miles away.

26:45.772 --> 26:49.890
So the sound travels supernaturally.
It's still just sound.

26:50.026 --> 26:51.641
So...

26:51.778 --> 26:55.191
You want to give somebody, what,
a "bubble of silence" curse,

26:55.323 --> 26:56.438
and then stick the baby inside of it

26:56.574 --> 27:00.408
so that the —— the evil sound
never leaves its throat?

27:02.622 --> 27:04.988
A troubled version
of cutting his vocal cords.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.239
But a lot less cruel.

27:06.375 --> 27:07.751
Okay, I wasn't really
suggesting that.

27:07.877 --> 27:10.710
Okay, but who do I trouble?
Help me think.

27:10.838 --> 27:13.375
Troubles are always related
to the people that have them.

27:13.508 --> 27:15.669
Right, Jack Driscoll was
a deep—sea diver.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.758
He developed
a crazy pressure trouble.

27:17.887 --> 27:20.378
—Oh.
—What?

27:20.515 --> 27:22.255
Well, you weren't exactly

27:22.391 --> 27:25.133
the most emotionally—expressive kid
in school.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.229
Now you're numb.

27:27.355 --> 27:28.891
—You're a sponge.
—Wasn't derogatory.

27:29.023 --> 27:33.642
Okay. Who can best manifest
this bubble of silence?

27:34.862 --> 27:36.978
Maybe somebody who's mute?

27:37.323 --> 27:38.984
Yeah.

27:40.785 --> 27:43.401
Or someone who can barely hear.

27:50.628 --> 27:52.243
Are you out of your mind?

27:52.380 --> 27:54.712
I definitely heard that
in both ears, my dear.

27:54.841 --> 27:57.253
Now, how about
we let Audrey continue?

27:57.385 --> 27:58.716
I don't want to hear another word.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.801
She wants to ruin your life
with a trouble.

28:00.930 --> 28:02.761
I don't want to do any of this.

28:04.058 --> 28:08.347
It's just our only option left.
I think you know that.

28:09.146 --> 28:10.397
So, with my poor hearing,

28:10.523 --> 28:13.230
you think I'll have a trouble
that silences things,

28:13.359 --> 28:15.315
and can save little Aaron
from killing people.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.400
I understand all that,

28:17.530 --> 28:19.862
but can you really give me
a trouble, brand—new,

28:19.991 --> 28:21.606
with the ribbon still on?

28:22.535 --> 28:24.275
|think so.

28:24.412 --> 28:25.993
Oh, I didn't think that was possible.

28:26.122 --> 28:28.704
Neither did I
till a couple days ago.

28:30.626 --> 28:33.538
—King me.
—A cheat deserves no crown.

28:33.671 --> 28:34.535
King me.

28:37.300 --> 28:40.417
Okay. I got next game.

28:46.726 --> 28:48.842
—Vincent.
—Hmm?

28:48.978 --> 28:50.138
Your birthmark.

28:51.147 --> 28:52.933
Oh.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.056
Hmm.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.767
Oh, my God.

28:57.904 --> 28:58.893
Are you doing that?

29:05.411 --> 29:07.151
I think it's the book.

29:07.288 --> 29:11.031
It's moving like a compass,
and the figure's the pointer.

29:11.167 --> 29:14.500
It's always pointing
in the same direction.

29:14.629 --> 29:17.041
What's it pointing at?

29:20.885 --> 29:22.375
The lighthouse.

29:24.305 --> 29:26.967
Maybe the lighthouse
is the heart of Haven.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.347
You sure you're ready for this?

29:32.480 --> 29:35.392
Yeah, I'm a tough, old goat.
You'll never hurt me.

29:39.987 --> 29:42.069
Okay.

30:19.819 --> 30:22.026
How do you feel?

30:22.154 --> 30:23.405
It feels strange.

30:23.531 --> 30:27.319
It, uh, tingles.

30:27.451 --> 30:31.194
Okay, well, I think it ——

30:31.330 --> 30:32.536
I think it worked.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.280
—[ Groaning]
—[ Clock chiming loudly]

30:34.417 --> 30:36.157
—What's that noise?
—What?

30:36.836 --> 30:38.997
My ears! Oh!

30:39.839 --> 30:43.627
[Baby crying]

30:48.139 --> 30:51.347
[Clock chiming, baby crying]

30:51.475 --> 30:53.807
It didn't work!
Everything's turned to noise!

30:53.936 --> 30:56.678
[Baby crying]

30:57.898 --> 30:59.729
Let's get the baby out of here.

30:59.859 --> 31:02.066
Something went wrong.

31:04.405 --> 31:05.736
Okay.

31:05.865 --> 31:07.150
There was nothing I could do.

31:07.283 --> 31:11.652
There was just too much noise.
He cried a lot.

31:11.787 --> 31:13.243
What happened in there?

31:13.372 --> 31:15.203
It's not your fault, Ben, okay?

31:15.332 --> 31:16.583
It's mine. Here...

31:16.709 --> 31:21.203
Why don't you just, um,
try to give him a bottle?

31:22.465 --> 31:24.296
—[ Cell phone rings]
—Okay.

31:25.134 --> 31:26.499
[Sighs]

31:26.635 --> 31:28.717
Five more bodies.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.341
Stay here.

31:37.063 --> 31:39.270
Please...

31:39.398 --> 31:40.513
tell me your name.

31:40.649 --> 31:44.141
Audrey Parker.

31:46.113 --> 31:49.230
Damn. I—I—I really...

31:50.409 --> 31:51.740
Nevermind.
[Chuckles]

31:51.869 --> 31:55.737
We'll get through this.
Um, what happened?

31:55.873 --> 31:57.113
I did what you told me to do.

31:57.249 --> 32:00.412
I gave a sweet, old man a trouble,
and it didn't work.

32:00.544 --> 32:02.500
But you gave him a trouble?

32:02.630 --> 32:03.915
Yes.

32:04.048 --> 32:08.337
Instead of eliminating sound,
it made everything sound strange.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.545
But it's pretty great.

32:12.681 --> 32:15.093
I mean, your first try,
after all these years,

32:15.226 --> 32:17.433
you made a sound—related trouble?

32:17.561 --> 32:19.142
Ah.

32:19.313 --> 32:23.807
When you did it,
did you feel anything?

32:23.943 --> 32:27.686
I felt terrible.
And I didn't help the baby.

32:27.822 --> 32:30.859
Try again,
and you will get it right.

32:40.376 --> 32:41.866
Why are there six in here?

32:42.002 --> 32:45.620
Troubles are more of an art
than a science.

32:45.756 --> 32:47.747
That's why we like them so much.

32:47.883 --> 32:50.499
Look, that baby's
almost done his bottle,

32:50.636 --> 32:52.877
and I know Audrey Parker
wants to help.

32:53.013 --> 32:57.427
You're close, I promise.
Keep going.

33:00.146 --> 33:01.852
And when you're back,

33:01.981 --> 33:04.643
you're gonna kick yourself
for not having more fun.

33:13.576 --> 33:15.066
ls Lincoln okay?

33:15.202 --> 33:16.442
Give me the box.

33:17.204 --> 33:18.990
I have to keep trying.

33:19.123 --> 33:21.580
You know, I'm fine if you want
to lie to that scumbag,

33:21.709 --> 33:23.825
but you're not gonna lie to me.

33:24.461 --> 33:25.792
Lie about what?

33:27.464 --> 33:29.170
You felt her.

33:29.300 --> 33:31.666
You felt your original self...

33:32.928 --> 33:34.543
And you liked it.

33:43.272 --> 33:44.853
This is the heart of Haven.

33:47.860 --> 33:49.896
There's been
some kind of lighthouse here

33:50.029 --> 33:52.862
as long as anyone can remember.

34:00.247 --> 34:02.579
No stairs, no ladder ——
How do we get up?

34:02.708 --> 34:05.165
Well, looks like
we're out of luck, then.

34:05.294 --> 34:07.751
—I think we should go down.
—We're not out of luck, Dave.

34:07.880 --> 34:10.087
You can hoist me
up to that ledge there.

34:10.216 --> 34:11.831
You know how hinky my back is.

34:11.967 --> 34:15.459
Guys, seriously, why don't
we go down the trap door?

34:15.596 --> 34:16.631
What door?

34:18.224 --> 34:20.010
You don't see the trap door?

34:21.018 --> 34:21.677
No.

34:21.810 --> 34:24.222
Then we definitely
have to go down there.

34:32.905 --> 34:36.193
I think going down there
is a really bad idea.

34:36.325 --> 34:38.691
Come on, Dave.

34:38.827 --> 34:41.409
Come on!

34:41.538 --> 34:42.823
It was terrifying.

34:42.957 --> 34:48.873
It was, like, the worst jolt
ofjust evil when I touched him.

34:49.421 --> 34:52.959
And I think that some
deep part of me liked it.

34:53.092 --> 34:54.798
Which is why you can't do this.

34:54.927 --> 34:58.294
The temptation is too much.
He will get you back.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.467
You won't be Audrey Parker anymore,
and you won't care.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.215
But I do care.

35:03.352 --> 35:06.594
I care about you.

35:07.356 --> 35:09.688
I'm not gonna let you do this.

35:09.817 --> 35:11.523
How do I justify what I did
to Lincoln?

35:11.652 --> 35:13.438
I can't just give up.

35:13.570 --> 35:15.106
We'll stick him
in a soundproof room.

35:15.239 --> 35:18.652
We'll —— something.
We will find another way.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.025
All right, but I am not
gonna hurt that baby.

35:21.161 --> 35:23.026
No, you're not.

35:25.499 --> 35:26.909
You're gonna hurt me.

35:27.793 --> 35:31.957
I know about the Crocker curse.
Kill me.

35:38.262 --> 35:40.127
It's really dark down here.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.889
—I think I have some matches.
—I knew it.

35:44.018 --> 35:46.225
You said you quit smoking
five years ago.

35:46.353 --> 35:47.809
Vincent.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.174
Holy jumping...

36:16.300 --> 36:19.087
I think we have found
the heart of Haven.

36:19.219 --> 36:20.880
Four people.

36:21.013 --> 36:22.969
To summon the door,
we need four people ——

36:23.098 --> 36:25.635
one for each spot.

36:33.484 --> 36:36.271
Okay, Ben, listen,
that's really noble of you, but ——

36:36.403 --> 36:38.394
Hang on.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.233
Are you sure about that?

36:44.828 --> 36:48.366
Am I sure I want to leave my son
without any parents?

36:49.124 --> 36:50.955
No.

36:51.085 --> 36:53.872
But I don't know another way.

36:54.004 --> 36:55.665
I'm sure she didn't tell you,

36:55.798 --> 36:57.914
but Gloria considered
the Crocker family curse

36:58.050 --> 36:59.836
a great blessing.

37:01.095 --> 37:02.585
VVhy?

37:02.721 --> 37:05.258
It cured her family of the trouble.

37:06.058 --> 37:08.470
One of your ancestors
killed one of hers.

37:10.604 --> 37:12.811
I want to take this trouble
to the grave.

37:16.777 --> 37:18.392
All right.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.572
Take the baby up to the house.
We'll meet you there.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.821
Are you crazy?

37:30.958 --> 37:33.449
You just told me
that I shouldn't trouble anyone else,

37:33.585 --> 37:35.450
and now you want me
to re—trouble you,

37:35.587 --> 37:37.293
give you the Crocker family curse

37:37.881 --> 37:39.621
so that you can kill
that baby's father?

37:39.758 --> 37:41.259
No, we've been down
that road before.

37:41.385 --> 37:43.797
Hey, I don't like it either.

37:43.929 --> 37:46.511
But he is volunteering...

37:47.307 --> 37:49.639
And so am I.

37:49.768 --> 37:52.384
You can't go on
troubling person after person

37:52.521 --> 37:54.011
until you get it right.

37:54.148 --> 37:56.639
Body count's just keep climbing.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.276
You know me.

37:59.403 --> 38:00.939
You know my curse.

38:01.738 --> 38:03.444
I mean, just...

38:04.450 --> 38:07.066
...one more hand slap,
and we're done.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.526
I mean, it's...

38:10.873 --> 38:13.615
It's that, or you kill the baby.

38:17.838 --> 38:20.295
No. No, Benny. No!

38:20.424 --> 38:22.039
It's the only way.

38:22.176 --> 38:24.667
No, it can't be!

38:25.554 --> 38:28.887
All the troubles
you've solved in this town...

38:29.016 --> 38:32.804
This is your plan —— to strip me
of my family one by one?

38:33.353 --> 38:37.266
Listen, Gloria,
it wasn't my idea.

38:37.399 --> 38:39.435
Well, then think of something, okay?

38:39.568 --> 38:41.024
Just think of something,

38:41.153 --> 38:43.610
something that won't make
my grandson an orphan!

38:43.739 --> 38:45.024
He'll have you.

38:45.157 --> 38:47.569
That's not enough.
He needs you.

38:47.701 --> 38:51.444
You called the Crocker family curse
a blessing

38:51.580 --> 38:53.571
when it cured your family
of their trouble.

38:55.334 --> 38:57.996
You know, I don't even know
what it was.

38:58.128 --> 38:59.709
I don't know either.

39:00.339 --> 39:02.045
How great would it be

39:02.174 --> 39:05.086
if Aaron's kids didn't know
about this curse?

39:07.179 --> 39:12.219
You raised me as best you could,
and I love you for it.

39:13.393 --> 39:19.639
I need you to teach Aaron
how to live and how to feel

39:19.775 --> 39:21.857
and how to cry without fear.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.477
[Sobbing]

39:47.678 --> 39:49.009
We are so close
to getting that door.

39:49.137 --> 39:50.126
If we find the right four people,

39:50.264 --> 39:52.596
we can put William away,
and life becomes manageable.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.430
That's still the plan, okay?

39:54.560 --> 39:57.097
I—I have to get back up there
and do this.

39:57.229 --> 39:58.844
No, you have to explain this to me.

39:58.981 --> 40:02.519
I understand that people are dying
and there's a baby,

40:02.651 --> 40:05.233
but why do you have to be the hero
this time?

40:07.197 --> 40:10.314
Because I'm not a wild card
like Gloria's boyfriend,

40:10.450 --> 40:14.113
because the Crocker you see
is the Crocker you get.

40:14.246 --> 40:16.658
Yeah, exactly.
The Crocker curse ——

40:16.790 --> 40:19.031
Do you really want
to go through all of that again?

40:20.085 --> 40:23.248
I don't want to.
I have to.

40:24.798 --> 40:27.335
I am gonna be fine

40:27.467 --> 40:30.630
and just as annoying
as when you first met me.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.138
This isn't funny, Duke.

40:32.264 --> 40:33.800
None of this is funny.
This is horrible.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.923
And I'm horrible for feeling this way,
but I don't care.

40:36.059 --> 40:38.471
Jennifer, stop.

40:38.604 --> 40:40.890
I know you're scared.

40:43.150 --> 40:46.688
After this, you and me ——
we will still be okay.

40:46.820 --> 40:48.811
No, I was with you
when your brother died,

40:48.947 --> 40:49.811
after your brother died,

40:49.948 --> 40:51.984
and everything
that you went through.

40:52.367 --> 40:55.609
—Look ——
—No. No ——

40:56.455 --> 40:57.820
We were supposed to have

40:57.956 --> 41:00.288
our flavored—coffee commercial
tomorrow...

41:01.001 --> 41:02.332
with all of this stuff behind us ——

41:02.461 --> 41:05.794
William, that stupid door.

41:07.382 --> 41:08.792
We still will.

41:10.385 --> 41:12.250
And we'll make a toast
to your family curse.

41:33.867 --> 41:35.448
Are we doing this?

41:36.078 --> 41:38.319
Yeah, we're doing this.
