00:11.195 --> 00:14.359
_

00:20.833 --> 00:22.397
Looks like the Lord's blessing us

00:22.422 --> 00:23.960
with another lovely day.

00:23.985 --> 00:25.742
Morning, Preacher Seth.

00:25.767 --> 00:26.982
Bit of a nip, though.

00:27.007 --> 00:28.789
I had to cover up the
rhubarb last night,

00:28.828 --> 00:30.492
keep the frost away.

00:32.432 --> 00:34.566
You seem to be shooting
at your chickens.

00:34.812 --> 00:37.375
No, I'm shooting at that egg-stealing

00:37.400 --> 00:39.467
son of a bitch that's cowering
in there with them.

00:39.492 --> 00:41.459
Can't afford to lose more eggs.

00:41.484 --> 00:43.651
Times are hard enough as it is.

00:46.444 --> 00:48.359
Aren't you losing both eggs and chickens

00:48.384 --> 00:50.335
each time you take a shot?

00:50.413 --> 00:52.867
A man has got to abide
by his principles.

00:55.859 --> 00:57.889
Suppose he does.

01:13.247 --> 01:15.414
I was only gonna take one egg.

01:17.483 --> 01:19.683
Stay down.

01:20.102 --> 01:22.669
- Did I get him?
- No.

01:22.823 --> 01:25.489
And it's not a him. It's a young girl.

01:25.582 --> 01:28.747
Well... old enough to steal,

01:28.821 --> 01:31.355
old enough to deal
with the consequences.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.435
Blessed are the merciful, Frank,

01:33.505 --> 01:35.372
for they'll receive mercy themselves.

01:35.445 --> 01:38.489
Are you saying that
I could get into heaven

01:38.635 --> 01:42.604
if I don't kill
that dirty, egg-sucking thief?

01:42.772 --> 01:44.380
Yes.

01:44.451 --> 01:45.888
What else is in it for me?

01:45.959 --> 01:48.669
- Besides eternal salvation?
- Yeah.

01:52.392 --> 01:54.659
I can probably also get you a dozen eggs

01:54.742 --> 01:57.192
and maybe a gallon or two
of fresh buttermilk.

02:01.043 --> 02:02.676
It's a deal.

02:06.274 --> 02:08.005
How'd you get me off the hook?

02:08.080 --> 02:10.419
I spoke in parables.

02:10.661 --> 02:13.099
- You what?
- I lied.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.499
What denomination are you?

02:15.620 --> 02:17.353
Pick one.

02:21.261 --> 02:22.694
Sam, Junior.

02:22.790 --> 02:24.216
How are our blockades holding up?

02:24.241 --> 02:26.318
- They're holding for now.
- We can't let

02:26.343 --> 02:27.981
one shipment get through to town.

02:28.006 --> 02:29.325
If a truck gets through,

02:29.350 --> 02:31.918
it'll be carrying my dead body on it.

02:38.457 --> 02:40.424
Who's that?

02:40.545 --> 02:43.713
Sam Riley.
He's leading our farmer strike.

02:45.802 --> 02:48.958
Yeah, I've been hearing about that.

02:49.348 --> 02:52.916
What are you striking against?
The American economic system.

02:53.075 --> 02:56.710
How you gonna do that?

02:56.786 --> 02:59.896
By breaking the system's back...

03:00.468 --> 03:02.868
one asshole banker at a time.

03:04.014 --> 03:06.810
<i>One of these asshole bankers,
named Calvin Rumple,</i>

03:06.895 --> 03:08.528
<i>has been paying off the local grocers</i>

03:08.553 --> 03:11.489
<i>to keep their food prices low.
They call it price-fixing.</i>

03:11.823 --> 03:13.730
<i>And it means none
of the local farmers can</i>

03:13.755 --> 03:15.646
<i>make back enough money
to pay off their loans,</i>

03:15.712 --> 03:17.958
<i>no matter the crop.</i>

03:18.611 --> 03:20.477
<i>Which is why we're doing this strike.</i>

03:20.502 --> 03:22.200
And once people start going hungry,

03:22.225 --> 03:24.859
not even Calvin Rumple'll be
able to keep food prices down.

03:25.234 --> 03:26.989
And then the farmers
can sell their goods

03:27.014 --> 03:29.786
and we might be able
to save their farms.

03:30.197 --> 03:33.131
How's this banker get away
with doing all this?

03:33.156 --> 03:35.623
He must be making someone rich.

03:35.648 --> 03:37.048
You do that, and you can get away

03:37.073 --> 03:39.489
with just about anything
in this country.

03:41.696 --> 03:44.575
<i>Okay, this is where I live.</i>

03:49.498 --> 03:51.798
I don't see any houses out here.

03:51.864 --> 03:54.064
Didn't say you would.

03:55.530 --> 03:57.063
You can come to our church.

03:57.139 --> 03:59.906
Whole congregations eats
after our morning service.

04:00.401 --> 04:01.925
I think I'd rather live in the woods

04:01.950 --> 04:03.942
and go hungry than listen
to a preacher tell me

04:03.967 --> 04:06.000
how to live my life.

04:06.382 --> 04:08.497
We're not that kind of church.

04:15.090 --> 04:17.262
Did you steal those
from that old-timer's coop?

04:17.341 --> 04:19.175
We're all a part of God's body.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.785
All I did was shift these eggs

04:20.810 --> 04:23.062
from God's left hand to his right.

04:23.255 --> 04:24.731
Here.

04:24.797 --> 04:27.131
- I don't take charity.
- They're not an offering.

04:27.450 --> 04:28.735
This is a payment for listening

04:28.770 --> 04:30.537
to what I'm gonna say next.

04:33.226 --> 04:36.827
Okay. Let's hear the sermon.

04:38.747 --> 04:42.649
Next time... don't settle for just eggs.

04:42.684 --> 04:44.984
Take the entire hen.

04:45.020 --> 04:46.920
Simple economics.

04:49.658 --> 04:50.757
Okay.

04:50.849 --> 04:52.738
And splatter some blood and feathers

04:52.763 --> 04:54.026
when you leave. It'll look

04:54.062 --> 04:55.407
like foxes hit the coop.

04:55.432 --> 04:57.107
Amen to that, Preacher.

05:12.162 --> 05:14.162
Any deliveries today?

05:14.251 --> 05:16.950
No. Not today.

05:16.985 --> 05:18.818
Not this week.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.687
Good.

05:20.813 --> 05:22.956
Just keep prices where they are.

05:23.087 --> 05:25.491
If the farmers keep blocking shipments

05:25.527 --> 05:27.126
and refusing to sell,

05:27.162 --> 05:28.895
they're gonna starve us all out.

05:28.930 --> 05:31.852
I've got a feeling they won't.

05:32.415 --> 05:35.802
In fact, when a dairy farmer
does deliver

05:35.837 --> 05:38.137
a load of fresh milk today,

05:38.282 --> 05:41.938
pay him... and only him...
double the going rate.

05:42.711 --> 05:44.811
What makes you so sure
a load will get through,

05:44.846 --> 05:47.384
today of all days?

05:47.686 --> 05:50.187
Call it banker's intuition.

05:58.894 --> 06:00.560
Pete.

06:00.595 --> 06:02.774
Something wrong?

06:03.031 --> 06:04.731
I'm heading into town.

06:06.601 --> 06:08.735
Calvin Rumple told me
I could get double for our milk

06:08.770 --> 06:11.237
if I brought it in today.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.072
But the blockades.

06:20.682 --> 06:23.216
I can buy some groceries
while I'm at it.

06:23.251 --> 06:24.884
The doctor said you need to start eating

06:24.920 --> 06:26.753
if you're gonna get well.

06:51.913 --> 06:54.480
Well, how lovely of you to join us.

06:54.516 --> 06:56.783
I had to do a little proselytizing.

06:56.818 --> 06:59.619
- How's the goulash coming along?
- I can't tell if

06:59.654 --> 07:02.055
it's bringing more people in
or driving them away.

07:02.090 --> 07:04.123
Sounds like my sermons.

07:04.159 --> 07:05.709
How do I look?

07:05.795 --> 07:07.538
Almost like a preacher.

07:16.210 --> 07:18.561
Welcome, friends.

07:18.725 --> 07:22.342
I'd like to speak to you
today about Jesus.

07:22.647 --> 07:25.745
Somehow in this modern era of ours,

07:25.780 --> 07:28.648
we have convinced each other
that Jesus Christ was

07:28.683 --> 07:31.617
some kind of respectable man...
a figure of...

07:31.795 --> 07:34.686
solemn authority.

07:34.791 --> 07:36.791
But the cops and judges
didn't crucify Jesus

07:36.858 --> 07:39.795
for being respectable.
No, they crucified him

07:39.861 --> 07:42.095
because he was an outlaw...

07:42.130 --> 07:43.997
a revolutionary.

07:44.032 --> 07:47.100
They crucified Jesus
because they were afraid

07:47.135 --> 07:49.035
he was gonna take power away from them

07:49.070 --> 07:50.434
and give it to the poor.

07:54.522 --> 07:57.844
<i>My friends, we're living
in biblical times again.</i>

07:57.879 --> 08:01.781
<i>There is a holy war in this country.</i>

08:01.816 --> 08:04.017
<i>The rich versus the poor...</i>

08:04.052 --> 08:08.054
<i>it's the same war Jesus himself was in.</i>

08:08.089 --> 08:09.856
- Whoa!
- Stop the truck!

08:09.891 --> 08:11.290
Stop the damn truck.

08:15.630 --> 08:18.364
Damn it, Pete. We're on strike.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.700
You ain't taking your milk to town.

08:20.735 --> 08:22.889
Look, Pam is real sick. I'm broke.

08:22.937 --> 08:24.506
Yeah, we're all broke, you idiot.

08:24.561 --> 08:27.974
Colby, give me the gun.

08:28.009 --> 08:30.710
All right. Off with the tarp.

08:30.745 --> 08:33.679
- Sam, please.
- We're all in this together,

08:33.715 --> 08:36.149
whether you like it or not.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.405
Now, you're gonna get up there
and dump that milk yourself.

08:46.117 --> 08:47.624
Sam.

08:52.623 --> 08:54.184
All right, boys.

08:57.372 --> 09:00.073
You're gonna let Pete go.

09:00.249 --> 09:03.483
See, Pete has milk to sell in town.

09:03.812 --> 09:05.378
Get back.

09:13.922 --> 09:17.069
Now, I shot this man
out of self-defense.

09:17.866 --> 09:20.839
Or am I incorrect to say...

09:21.202 --> 09:23.930
that he aimed his pistol
right at my person?

10:03.171 --> 10:06.472
Unless you wish to join
this man up yonder,

10:06.742 --> 10:09.858
I suggest you remove
your gaze from that weapon.

10:17.045 --> 10:20.987
See, this farmer strike? It's over.

10:21.083 --> 10:22.916
So go home.

10:23.076 --> 10:25.928
'Cause tomorrow, you're gonna
sell your goods in town.

10:43.311 --> 10:46.179
<i>And Jesus tells us,"Think not"</i>

10:46.214 --> 10:49.048
<i>"that I am come to send peace on Earth."</i>

10:49.083 --> 10:52.485
"I come not to send peace, but a sword."

10:54.160 --> 10:57.862
Not peace... but a sword.

11:00.156 --> 11:03.055
Jesus Christ Himself says that...

11:03.150 --> 11:06.781
because Jesus knew he was at war.

11:07.576 --> 11:11.156
But the question is...

11:11.739 --> 11:13.906
do you?

11:17.775 --> 11:22.775
synced & corrected by PopcornAWH
www.addic7ed.com

11:47.180 --> 11:50.109
Pete, buy yourself a drink.

11:50.144 --> 11:52.511
Wash the stains
from your conscience, huh?

12:22.176 --> 12:24.410
Let's all have a drink, huh?

12:24.569 --> 12:27.889
Round of whiskeys
for all my friends... on me.

12:33.087 --> 12:34.772
You bet.

12:57.767 --> 12:59.867
Well, now, if y'all think
you're too good

12:59.892 --> 13:02.736
to drink my hard-earned whiskey...

13:03.151 --> 13:05.174
well, we can...

13:05.953 --> 13:07.420
we can settle matters right now

13:07.455 --> 13:09.408
in Wyoming fashion.

13:22.670 --> 13:25.304
I hope you enjoyed the service.

13:25.347 --> 13:27.680
Never seen the pulpit
used for politics like that.

13:27.709 --> 13:29.242
Well, the point's

13:29.267 --> 13:30.676
not to just understand the world

13:30.712 --> 13:32.611
but to change it.

13:32.908 --> 13:35.648
- Is that in the Bible?
- It's on every page.

13:36.088 --> 13:37.855
Preacher Seth!

13:43.157 --> 13:45.257
Ma'am.

13:45.293 --> 13:49.295
We was... we was blocking Pete's
shipment like we planned.

13:49.330 --> 13:52.314
But there was a strikebreaker.
He shot Sam Riley.

13:52.541 --> 13:56.068
- He claimed self-defense.
- Sam's dead?

13:56.104 --> 13:58.869
He killed Sam right in front
of his own boy.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.346
A toast...

14:07.382 --> 14:10.649
to the life of Sam Riley.

14:13.588 --> 14:17.010
He was too good, truly, for this...

14:17.120 --> 14:19.079
godforsaken world.

14:23.297 --> 14:26.332
Now, who else can speak to the character

14:26.367 --> 14:29.769
of Sam Riley?
Must be a brother among you.

14:30.033 --> 14:32.982
There's nothing to do
but farm, fart, and fornicate

14:33.007 --> 14:34.455
in these parts, so...

14:34.480 --> 14:38.115
Sam Riley must at least have a cousin.

14:38.358 --> 14:40.192
Hmm?

14:50.186 --> 14:51.786
What's your name, friend?

14:54.629 --> 14:57.029
Preston.

14:57.064 --> 14:59.698
Preston what?

15:03.604 --> 15:05.179
Riley.

15:09.031 --> 15:12.311
Another round, on me.

15:12.478 --> 15:14.879
Well, cousin Preston.

15:16.317 --> 15:18.451
Let's have ourselves a little talk.

15:25.259 --> 15:27.793
Leave the bottle.

15:29.499 --> 15:32.671
- Bottoms up, comrade.
- Comrade?

15:32.810 --> 15:34.851
Well, isn't it true what they say, huh?

15:34.905 --> 15:37.573
That all the lowa Rileys
bleed communist red?

15:37.805 --> 15:40.406
I mean, isn't that
what Sam here was doing, hmm?

15:40.441 --> 15:44.276
Out there organizing
and agitating a commie revolt!

15:44.312 --> 15:45.820
Uh...

15:45.960 --> 15:50.052
Sam was my, um... second cousin.

15:50.151 --> 15:52.084
We weren't that close.

15:55.300 --> 15:57.734
Preston, I can see that
you're a reasonable fellow.

15:57.825 --> 16:00.159
So what I would like to know now

16:00.194 --> 16:02.261
are the names of anyone who might react

16:02.296 --> 16:06.232
to these unfortunate events
in an unreasonable manner.

16:20.437 --> 16:23.209
Who would seek revenge
for the death of Sam Riley?

16:32.517 --> 16:34.195
His son...

16:36.330 --> 16:38.453
Sam Jr.

16:41.335 --> 16:43.469
He chews a toothpick, doesn't he?

17:09.230 --> 17:10.487
What about Sam?

17:10.534 --> 17:13.409
Sam Riley is your family.

17:14.145 --> 17:15.944
Not mine.

17:17.492 --> 17:19.907
But I'm sure you're gonna
do right by him.

17:28.581 --> 17:32.345
_

17:37.476 --> 17:40.065
Nice work, boys.

17:41.313 --> 17:42.546
Is it true what they're saying?

17:42.581 --> 17:45.573
You deputized a bunch of Yankee
strikebreakers to shut us up?

17:45.601 --> 17:48.028
Times are hard on everyone, Gil.

17:48.053 --> 17:50.153
We gotta get those mines open again.

17:50.178 --> 17:51.321
"Times are hard on everyone"?

17:51.357 --> 17:53.523
Hell, you sound like a company man.

17:53.559 --> 17:56.612
Yeah, well, go back to work.

17:57.098 --> 18:00.159
What, Prohibition's been repealed?

18:03.183 --> 18:05.617
Get the governor on the phone.

18:06.005 --> 18:08.739
Tell him I'm gonna need
more than these strikebreakers

18:08.774 --> 18:11.323
to get those mines running again.

18:11.369 --> 18:13.703
We're gonna need
the damn National Guard.

18:13.728 --> 18:16.395
It is not politically viable
for Governor Sampson

18:16.420 --> 18:18.220
to send in the Kentucky National Guard

18:18.245 --> 18:19.678
at this moment...

18:19.885 --> 18:22.286
so he sent me instead.

18:23.654 --> 18:27.339
And... who are you supposed to be?

18:27.395 --> 18:29.962
My name is Connie Nunn.

18:29.987 --> 18:31.953
I am employed by the William J. Burns

18:31.978 --> 18:34.812
International Detective Agency.

18:34.962 --> 18:37.529
Burns Detective Agency.

18:37.753 --> 18:40.135
Like the Pinkertons, right?

18:40.239 --> 18:44.141
Yes... except we are competent,

18:44.239 --> 18:46.760
dependable, and discreet.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.029
It appears you have been suffering

18:51.057 --> 18:52.557
some local unrest.

18:52.582 --> 18:54.982
Yeah.

18:55.097 --> 18:59.909
And the, uh... the governor sent you?

19:00.102 --> 19:03.737
As I mentioned,
it is not politically viable

19:03.772 --> 19:06.737
to call in the National Guard.

19:07.038 --> 19:08.337
But...

19:08.443 --> 19:10.760
if the striking miners...

19:11.682 --> 19:14.362
instigated a bloodbath...

19:15.250 --> 19:17.751
it could become politically viable.

19:18.346 --> 19:20.153
Ooh... look.

19:20.189 --> 19:22.917
Everyone's real angry right now,

19:23.008 --> 19:26.776
but there hasn't been
any kind of bloodbath.

19:26.929 --> 19:29.229
No, not yet.

19:29.295 --> 19:31.796
But before I commence my work,

19:31.854 --> 19:35.189
I would like to ask you
a personal favor.

19:37.673 --> 19:39.406
Have you ever seen this man?

19:39.441 --> 19:41.808
- Who's he?
- His known aliases include

19:41.844 --> 19:44.611
Seth Bergson, Seth Fredricks,
and Seth Dalton.

19:44.653 --> 19:46.120
And it's rumored he now masquerades

19:46.145 --> 19:47.581
as a roving preacher,

19:47.853 --> 19:52.766
composing seditious pamphlets
and inciting riots.

19:52.888 --> 19:55.932
He was last seen
in Marion County, Arkansas.

19:56.254 --> 19:58.554
Doing what?

19:58.714 --> 20:01.382
Murdering my husband.

20:25.487 --> 20:28.655
Maybe Sam Jr. should think
about heading out of town

20:28.690 --> 20:30.932
for a spell.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.206
Until things settle down.

20:33.328 --> 20:35.462
Sam Jr. is needed here at home.

20:36.899 --> 20:38.846
Well, what if this cowboy fellow

20:38.892 --> 20:42.794
that shot Sam wants to come
for Sam Jr. too?

20:45.007 --> 20:47.574
Why would you think that, Preston?

20:51.815 --> 20:55.198
He was a cowboy. He fired a Colt.

20:56.069 --> 20:58.036
I don't know where he was from.

20:58.133 --> 20:59.628
He mentioned Wyoming.

20:59.721 --> 21:01.521
How do you know that?

21:01.556 --> 21:04.357
The cowboy brought Sam's body
to the speakeasy

21:04.393 --> 21:06.359
after shooting him.

21:06.395 --> 21:08.428
He bought everyone a round of drinks.

21:08.502 --> 21:10.402
Oh, that son of a bitch.

21:10.503 --> 21:14.244
I know you and Sam
shared similar ideals,

21:14.294 --> 21:16.695
but unless you can call down a miracle,

21:16.940 --> 21:19.854
we're gonna lose this farm.

21:20.252 --> 21:23.386
I say we call down a miracle.

21:23.679 --> 21:25.299
How?

21:25.768 --> 21:27.447
I believe a miracle is nothing more than

21:27.482 --> 21:29.716
a moment of God's attention.

21:31.920 --> 21:34.287
A man named Martin Luther argued

21:34.323 --> 21:36.878
against the corrupt
authorities of his day.

21:37.221 --> 21:39.259
He... he wrote out his argument
on a piece of paper

21:39.294 --> 21:41.027
and then nailed it
to the door of a church.

21:43.322 --> 21:45.455
And he called down a miracle.

21:46.862 --> 21:48.368
What do you have in mind?

21:50.850 --> 21:53.351
A revolution.

22:02.584 --> 22:04.284
Is there some kind of church event

22:04.319 --> 22:05.730
you and the preacher
would like us to cover?

22:05.754 --> 22:07.323
Oh, not presently.

22:07.401 --> 22:09.889
We've been here for six months,
and I'm still trying

22:09.925 --> 22:12.510
to get a sense of this town's landscape.

22:12.535 --> 22:13.964
I can help you with that.

22:13.989 --> 22:15.790
The town's landscape's
predominantly flat.

22:15.815 --> 22:18.749
Mm, yes, I noticed. Pretty damn flat.

22:21.543 --> 22:25.268
Yes, it is... Ms. Preacher's Wife.

22:25.874 --> 22:27.540
Call me Amelia.

22:28.977 --> 22:31.010
- May I?
- Please.

22:33.220 --> 22:36.688
And it's not
the town's physical landscape

22:36.818 --> 22:40.385
I'm concerned with;
it's the metaphysical one.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.457
They say a man's language
is a map of his soul.

22:44.493 --> 22:46.459
Of course, I wouldn't know.

22:46.495 --> 22:48.595
Is it true?

22:48.630 --> 22:50.330
- Perhaps.
- And the "Holden Tribune"

22:50.365 --> 22:51.831
is word of public record here?

22:51.867 --> 22:54.434
- For better or worse.
- Ah, so, for better or worse,

22:54.469 --> 22:57.437
it's the map of this town's soul.

22:57.472 --> 23:00.774
And yet for weeks, your paper
has refused to report

23:00.809 --> 23:03.128
on the collective revolt
of the local farmers.

23:03.153 --> 23:04.444
"Collective revolt."

23:04.479 --> 23:06.846
Those are dangerous words around here.

23:06.882 --> 23:08.681
Are "dangerous words" the reason

23:08.717 --> 23:10.061
that the farmers' leader
was just shot dead

23:10.085 --> 23:11.451
in cold blood?

23:13.424 --> 23:15.958
Someone shot Sam Riley?

23:16.158 --> 23:18.925
Is your paper going to ignore that too?

23:24.666 --> 23:27.067
I'm sure the appropriate
words will be found.

23:27.102 --> 23:29.002
Well.

23:29.037 --> 23:33.640
How lovely... "the appropriate words"!

23:33.675 --> 23:36.042
"Here stands"

23:36.078 --> 23:38.745
"the proud proprietor Archibald Weems."

23:38.780 --> 23:41.481
As we can see, 'the only emperor

23:41.516 --> 23:44.584
is the emperor of ice cream.'

23:44.610 --> 23:46.190
DL Sullivan.

23:46.360 --> 23:48.712
You're presently in the brief interval
of your only life.

23:48.737 --> 23:49.995
Is that how you want to spend it,

23:50.020 --> 23:51.666
writing about ice cream vendors

23:51.691 --> 23:54.292
and school recitals instead
of the life-and-death struggles

23:54.317 --> 23:55.683
- of your fellow man?
- Yes,

23:55.706 --> 23:58.006
if I want to keep my job.

23:58.042 --> 23:59.909
And what about your soul?

23:59.964 --> 24:01.476
Is something wrong, miss?

24:06.383 --> 24:09.318
"Let be be finale of seem."

24:09.353 --> 24:14.022
"The only emperor
is the emperor of ice cream."

24:21.632 --> 24:23.398
What the hell was that?

24:23.488 --> 24:25.855
A line from a Wallace Stevens poem.

24:26.047 --> 24:28.643
- Never heard of him.
- No one really has.

24:32.253 --> 24:35.287
She said someone
just murdered Sam Riley.

25:00.637 --> 25:02.838
The preacher's wife was just in here.

25:02.873 --> 25:04.973
She said Sam Riley's been killed.

25:06.377 --> 25:08.777
Sam Riley's dead.

25:08.963 --> 25:11.713
- An American tragedy.
- <i>Calvin,</i>

25:11.749 --> 25:15.851
<i>she was reciting poetry
to my new reporter.</i>

25:16.096 --> 25:18.587
Well, let's make sure
the sheriff is appraised

25:18.622 --> 25:20.622
on both accounts.

25:25.896 --> 25:27.796
How long you been
in this country, Eddie?

25:27.831 --> 25:30.332
Three hellish years.

25:30.901 --> 25:34.336
Then you should be familiar
with our moonshining laws.

25:34.371 --> 25:35.837
Shouldn't you?

25:40.477 --> 25:42.544
Uncle Sheriff Don?

25:42.869 --> 25:44.646
Yes, Raymond?

25:44.681 --> 25:49.088
Trouble in town.
Some cowboy shot Sam Riley.

25:51.563 --> 25:53.363
You don't say.

25:57.428 --> 25:59.528
You brought me a clean shirt.

25:59.633 --> 26:01.133
Mm-hmm.

26:01.519 --> 26:03.419
Ma even ironed it.

26:03.884 --> 26:07.286
Hmm... aw, bless
that good woman's heart.

26:12.042 --> 26:14.042
So this is when you kill me, is it?

26:14.440 --> 26:16.478
Kill you?

26:16.682 --> 26:19.681
Now, Eddie, that would just be a waste

26:19.716 --> 26:22.822
of your fine moonshining talents.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.454
No, now that you better understand

26:25.489 --> 26:27.055
our local customs...

26:29.059 --> 26:31.426
I'm going into business with you.

26:31.596 --> 26:33.895
I want you to double your usual batch,

26:33.931 --> 26:36.531
- half going to my speakeasy...
- Your speakeasy?

26:36.567 --> 26:39.362
And one half goes to the brothel.

26:39.870 --> 26:41.603
You're not the only entrepreneur

26:41.638 --> 26:42.871
in Holden County.

26:46.743 --> 26:48.844
Find the cowboy.

26:57.440 --> 27:00.899
- This is good here.
- Whoa, ho!

27:00.924 --> 27:02.624
All right. Thank you for the ride,

27:02.659 --> 27:05.193
and here, take this.
Maybe now you can afford

27:05.229 --> 27:06.628
to put some fuel in this thing, huh?

27:06.663 --> 27:07.885
Yes, sir.

27:07.924 --> 27:09.931
Is this really necessary?

27:09.967 --> 27:11.766
If the great humanitarian

27:11.802 --> 27:13.568
Herbert Hoover himself
walked through that door,

27:13.604 --> 27:16.171
I'd be checking
his cock and balls as well.

27:16.479 --> 27:17.906
Drop 'em.

27:22.369 --> 27:24.746
Okay, let's take a look.

27:27.651 --> 27:30.085
Slow down your excitement there
a little bit, Valentino.

27:30.120 --> 27:31.753
I know I'm a pretty little flower,

27:31.788 --> 27:34.408
but you gotta save something
for the girls.

27:38.028 --> 27:39.628
What the hell was that?

27:39.663 --> 27:40.929
Did it burn?

27:40.964 --> 27:42.597
- No.
- Good.

27:42.633 --> 27:44.466
That means you don't have any sores.

27:44.501 --> 27:46.935
It's Lysol.

27:47.119 --> 27:50.238
Della, we've got
some real money out here.

27:50.516 --> 27:53.216
You're ready to go, Your Honor.

27:59.096 --> 28:02.184
Well, hello there, handsome.
Welcome to our happy home.

28:02.219 --> 28:03.885
Have a seat.

28:07.119 --> 28:10.525
If you wish.
How much to stay here a week?

28:10.561 --> 28:12.093
Well, that depends

28:12.129 --> 28:13.728
on how many girls and what, exactly,

28:13.771 --> 28:15.721
- you have in mind.
- One girl,

28:15.752 --> 28:17.799
and I pay not to discuss it.

28:17.834 --> 28:19.668
Will she be able to walk
at the end of it?

28:19.703 --> 28:22.704
It depends if she stays on my good side.

28:22.931 --> 28:24.609
$300 for a week.

28:24.673 --> 28:27.808
$200. Room and board included.

28:31.057 --> 28:35.629
The pure products of lowa.

28:35.719 --> 28:38.072
What they lack in glamour,
they make up for

28:38.119 --> 28:40.655
in pliability and grit.

28:43.627 --> 28:46.027
This $100 bill could be yours.

28:46.063 --> 28:47.829
- For what?
- Well, first off,

28:47.864 --> 28:50.565
for not being stupid enough
to ask me questions.

28:50.601 --> 28:54.169
Take a look at this
and tell me what you think.

29:21.411 --> 29:23.955
Yours.

29:24.101 --> 29:26.201
I want $200.

29:28.217 --> 29:31.539
And why would I give a prostitute $200?

29:31.717 --> 29:34.209
'Cause it appears
you're looking for a reader,

29:34.244 --> 29:35.744
and I'm the only one you're gonna find

29:35.779 --> 29:37.846

29:38.022 --> 29:40.165

Because if you disappoint me,

32:25.679 --> 32:28.713
you can be so easily discarded.

32:31.818 --> 32:33.652
I'll read the letter.

32:40.193 --> 32:41.993
Privacy.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.985
"Our client has a vested interest"

32:47.010 --> 32:49.177
"in a peaceful heartland."

32:49.202 --> 32:53.271
"These farmers must be
put in their proper place."

32:53.318 --> 32:57.219
"This is no time
for exotic political ideals."

32:57.331 --> 33:00.298
"Our nation's very survival
depends upon law and order."

33:01.641 --> 33:02.914
Private room.

33:02.950 --> 33:04.749
<i>I'd like to chat with a cowboy</i>

33:04.785 --> 33:07.686
<i>from Wyoming. Would you be him?</i>

33:07.721 --> 33:10.822
- Who's asking?
- Sheriff Don Berryman.

33:12.125 --> 33:15.026
- Well, hello, Sheriff.
<i>- Hello, Bess.</i>

33:15.062 --> 33:16.782
<i>I'd just like to talk
to your cowboy friend.</i>

33:16.807 --> 33:19.474
Well, my cowboy friend's
presently balls deep

33:19.499 --> 33:21.499
in darkling muff.

33:21.735 --> 33:23.868
Give us just a moment to finish up.

33:23.904 --> 33:26.524
<i>Okay. One minute.</i>

33:26.974 --> 33:28.974
You can go out the window.

33:30.507 --> 33:32.399
I think I'll stay.

33:43.589 --> 33:46.557
Some of us have a reputation to uphold.

34:07.889 --> 34:09.088
Leave.

34:09.138 --> 34:11.705
- Ask.
- What?

34:11.755 --> 34:13.489
You told the young lady to leave.

34:13.547 --> 34:15.681
You should've asked.

34:15.889 --> 34:17.755
Mm.

34:17.791 --> 34:19.196
My dear Bessie,

34:19.368 --> 34:22.501
could you please give us
a few minutes of privacy?

34:22.601 --> 34:24.101
Of course, Sheriff.

34:27.009 --> 34:29.074
So gentle of you to ask.

34:30.771 --> 34:33.094
There was a shooting today.

34:33.713 --> 34:36.112
- Here, in my county.
- Mm-hmm.

34:36.243 --> 34:37.851
Now, this is a quiet corner
of the Earth.

34:37.876 --> 34:41.601
We resolve our differences
with words and laws here,

34:41.688 --> 34:44.889
- not guns.
- "Words and laws."

34:45.152 --> 34:48.157
Of course, you do know
that neither means shit

34:48.263 --> 34:50.063
unless there's a gun behind them.

34:50.233 --> 34:52.688
Besides, that farmer aimed his pistol

34:52.728 --> 34:54.641
right at me, Sheriff.
You can ask anyone.

34:54.666 --> 34:55.929
I shot that hayseed...

34:57.784 --> 35:01.048
My, my. Aren't we suspicious?

35:01.100 --> 35:02.733
Shouldn't we be?

35:02.792 --> 35:04.859
Glad we're having this talk, Sheriff,

35:05.105 --> 35:07.272
because I do fear that some
local citizen's gonna

35:07.307 --> 35:09.374
seek revenge for my act of self-defense.

35:09.409 --> 35:11.696
Well, they might.
You should leave town now.

35:11.742 --> 35:13.241
Yeah, in due time.

35:13.346 --> 35:15.413
First, take out my wallet.

35:17.883 --> 35:20.151
It's under my hat.

35:27.022 --> 35:29.508
"Pinkerton National Detective Agency."

35:29.571 --> 35:31.766
Name's Creeley Turner.

35:31.920 --> 35:33.754
We've been monitoring your farmer strike

35:33.779 --> 35:35.245
for some time. We can't have it getting

35:35.270 --> 35:36.703
any bigger or louder.

35:36.837 --> 35:38.236
Now, I thought you fellows stuck

35:38.271 --> 35:40.680
to smacking around factory workers.

35:40.857 --> 35:42.557
Why are the Pinkertons so concerned

35:42.582 --> 35:45.680
about some angry farmers
out in the middle of lowa?

35:45.765 --> 35:47.665
Well, because some of us
would rather not have

35:47.690 --> 35:49.861
a homegrown Bolshevik uprising, Sheriff.

35:49.944 --> 35:52.044
I can take care of those farmers myself.

35:52.069 --> 35:55.137
Eh, if that were true,
they wouldn't have sent me.

35:55.899 --> 35:59.673
But we don't have to
make this unpleasant, so...

35:59.826 --> 36:02.460
I'm gonna continue
to conduct my business quietly,

36:02.485 --> 36:04.719
and you, you can continue to...

36:04.748 --> 36:07.582
do all your business.

36:07.720 --> 36:09.219
Now, unless you're sticking around

36:09.261 --> 36:11.938
to give me a free one...

36:12.055 --> 36:14.956
I think it's probably time you leave.

36:53.513 --> 36:56.014
Now, where did you get
this one, Preacher?

36:57.701 --> 37:00.068
Seminary tussle?

37:00.274 --> 37:02.908
Disturbed Calvinists?

37:03.023 --> 37:04.255
Pet bobcat.

37:04.291 --> 37:06.257
Pet bobcat? Really?

37:06.293 --> 37:08.292
Her name was Peaches.

37:08.374 --> 37:10.875
- Mm-hmm.
- She was ferocious.

37:10.964 --> 37:14.833
Fearless. Sort of my type.

37:31.585 --> 37:32.951
What?

37:32.986 --> 37:34.385
I heard something.

37:34.421 --> 37:36.187
Yeah... me.

37:45.766 --> 37:47.666
Seth, what is it?

37:47.691 --> 37:49.124
There's someone outside.

37:56.829 --> 37:58.962
Lock the door. Keep the lights off.

37:59.066 --> 38:02.301
If anyone tries to get in,
shoot to kill.

38:02.384 --> 38:04.084
Right here.

38:18.291 --> 38:20.759
Hide all you want, preacher man.

38:23.850 --> 38:25.850
We know you're in here.

38:29.017 --> 38:31.609
All your preaching and agitating...

38:31.645 --> 38:34.279
it ends tonight.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.689
That was the main artery in your leg.

38:45.714 --> 38:49.449
If you answer my questions,
I might be able to save you.

38:49.680 --> 38:51.408
How many of you are there?

38:51.498 --> 38:53.478
- Three.
- You from here?

38:53.556 --> 38:54.989
No. Chicago.

38:55.037 --> 38:57.236
- Who sent you?
- Preacher, please.

38:57.337 --> 38:58.807
Answer.

38:58.832 --> 39:00.866
Some kind of doctor paid us...

39:00.910 --> 39:02.510
100 bucks...

41:01.524 --> 41:04.058
What do we say if someone comes by here?

41:10.719 --> 41:14.430
Goldenrod, for our winter garden.

41:15.041 --> 41:17.642
Unexpected beauty pleases the Lord.

41:19.712 --> 41:22.513
You're actually starting
to sound like a man of God.

41:22.549 --> 41:24.344
Good...

41:24.551 --> 41:26.484
because I sure as hell
don't feel like one.

41:26.519 --> 41:30.047
Seth, they were going to kill us.

41:30.289 --> 41:32.423
They had it coming.

41:34.530 --> 41:36.530
Maybe they did.

41:43.736 --> 41:45.719
Why are you shutting me out?

41:50.070 --> 41:52.078
I didn't know I was.

41:55.215 --> 41:57.758
For two years...

41:58.093 --> 42:00.326
we've been going from town to town,

42:00.417 --> 42:02.133
trying to start a revolution,

42:02.180 --> 42:03.621
trying to get the working people

42:03.656 --> 42:05.790
to stand up for themselves.

42:05.875 --> 42:09.460
And you still won't tell me
anything about who you are...

42:09.664 --> 42:12.563
Or where you're from.

42:12.624 --> 42:16.326
We agreed we wouldn't
talk about our pasts.

42:21.407 --> 42:24.242
We're burying the bodies
of three men we just killed.

42:24.277 --> 42:26.477
If that doesn't top
what you've done in the past...

42:26.535 --> 42:28.301
It doesn't come close.

42:29.530 --> 42:31.630
I've done wicked things in this world,

42:31.751 --> 42:34.318
and every day, I'm trying
to make up for that.

42:35.688 --> 42:38.579
When these three don't show up
back in Chicago,

42:38.691 --> 42:41.626
whatever doctor hired them
will be sending more.

42:51.170 --> 42:53.336
Good.

42:53.403 --> 42:55.570
That's how revolutions begin.

43:04.229 --> 43:05.573
Pete.

43:07.554 --> 43:10.401
Scrambled eggs and blood sausage.

43:12.825 --> 43:15.089
Maybe later, dear.

43:16.496 --> 43:18.629
Okay.

44:07.714 --> 44:09.480
<i>Everyone, listen up.</i>

44:09.515 --> 44:11.190
<i>Gather round.</i>

44:11.215 --> 44:13.916
<i>My father, Sam Riley, the
leader of our farmer strike,</i>

44:13.943 --> 44:15.509
<i>was murdered in cold blood
the other day.</i>

44:15.771 --> 44:18.806
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

44:18.888 --> 44:20.855
Then find out.

44:25.455 --> 44:26.888
Preacher Seth is gonna talk about it

44:26.913 --> 44:29.147
up at the chapel... talk about change...

44:33.906 --> 44:35.706
Holden County Sheriff's Department.

44:35.742 --> 44:37.708
<i>- Sheriff Berryman.</i>
- Nah, he's not in.

44:37.744 --> 44:40.026
This is Deputy Berryman.

44:40.121 --> 44:43.322
<i>I passed Sam Riley's son
on a farm road this morning.</i>

44:43.397 --> 44:44.863
<i>He had a rifle with him
and it looked like</i>

44:44.888 --> 44:48.096
<i>he was headed
to Pete Collingsworth's place.</i>

44:48.323 --> 44:49.720
Who's this calling?

44:49.756 --> 44:51.322
I think I heard a gunshot.

44:51.357 --> 44:53.104
I just thought you should know.

45:11.384 --> 45:14.652
Give me that whiskey.

45:14.914 --> 45:17.014
Anything else?

45:19.182 --> 45:20.885
Where's my letter?

45:20.959 --> 45:23.525
I took it and I hid it.

45:23.596 --> 45:25.762
- Why?
- It was in plain sight.

45:25.892 --> 45:28.518
Sheriff's sharper than he looks.

45:31.017 --> 45:33.550
And I thought it'd come in handy.

45:33.633 --> 45:37.838
Blackmail, extortion...
that kind of thing.

45:38.024 --> 45:40.391
So what are you, hmm?

45:40.473 --> 45:43.974
Some kind of grifter whore?

45:44.977 --> 45:47.578
That's exactly who I am.

45:48.981 --> 45:51.393
Yeah.

45:51.581 --> 45:54.282
Well, you're gonna
grift plenty out of me.

45:58.381 --> 46:01.249
But only if we stay alive.

46:04.897 --> 46:06.864
Go on, take it.

46:16.843 --> 46:19.076
Come on.

46:19.181 --> 46:21.975
Two more.

46:22.081 --> 46:24.281
Come on, right there.
Make 'em deep, damn it.

46:34.794 --> 46:36.604
Another.

47:10.092 --> 47:12.859
So who's this Dr. Hopkins?

47:12.965 --> 47:16.100
He's a hell of a writer.
Touch of genius, maybe?

47:16.997 --> 47:19.131
He'll be delighted to hear it.

47:22.735 --> 47:24.669
Welcome.

47:24.789 --> 47:26.989
My name is Seth Davenport.

47:27.079 --> 47:29.513
My wife, Amelia, and I do our portion

47:29.549 --> 47:32.716
of the Lord's work here
through this church.

47:38.891 --> 47:42.059
<i>Whatever I want men to do unto me,</i>

47:42.094 --> 47:44.962
<i>I should do unto them.</i>

47:49.168 --> 47:50.501
<i>As children, we were taught</i>

47:50.536 --> 47:53.804
<i>that the golden rule means to be kind.</i>

47:55.107 --> 47:57.541
But we're not children anymore.

47:57.577 --> 48:00.711
And the golden rule is not
an invitation to compliance.

48:00.785 --> 48:03.119
It's a call to arms.

48:03.272 --> 48:06.417
Because if I were to conspire
as our banks, businesses,

48:06.452 --> 48:08.194
and government have all conspired

48:08.219 --> 48:10.608
to rip off the very people
who grow our food

48:10.633 --> 48:12.733
and keep our nation strong,
what would I want

48:12.758 --> 48:15.493
my fellow man to do unto me?

48:19.966 --> 48:22.166
I'd want him to break my fucking back.

48:25.438 --> 48:28.606
And if I were to threaten
the brave farmers

48:28.641 --> 48:31.175
who've banded together
to strengthen one another,

48:31.210 --> 48:34.845
what would I want my fellow man
to do unto me?

48:39.927 --> 48:42.757
I would want him to break
my fucking back.

48:46.826 --> 48:50.027
And if I were to attack
those brave farmers,

48:50.062 --> 48:52.696
what would I want my fellow man
to do unto me?

48:52.732 --> 48:54.899
I'd want him to break my fucking back.

48:54.934 --> 48:57.167
And if I were to murder in cold blood

48:57.203 --> 49:00.471
the very man who led
these brave farmers,

49:00.506 --> 49:02.873
what would I want
my fellow man to do unto me?

49:02.909 --> 49:04.875
I'd want him to break my fucking back!

49:04.911 --> 49:07.811
And if I were Sam Riley himself,

49:07.847 --> 49:11.982
what would I want my fellow
brothers and sisters to do?

49:15.955 --> 49:18.822
I would want them to listen.

49:18.858 --> 49:22.726
Listen to Sam. Listen to his silence.

49:23.614 --> 49:27.582
A roaring, furious, deafening silence.

49:29.580 --> 49:32.068
And what does this man's silence mean?

49:36.008 --> 49:37.741
Can you hear it?

49:49.449 --> 49:52.183
This is a peaceful assembly, Sheriff.

49:58.898 --> 50:01.131
Pete Collingsworth's been murdered.

50:10.343 --> 50:12.109
Sam Jr.

50:16.916 --> 50:19.655
You need to come with us.

50:19.937 --> 50:21.169
No, this isn't right!

50:21.194 --> 50:23.060
No, listen, I didn't kill Pete.

50:23.114 --> 50:24.835
Sheriff, I didn't kill Pete.

50:24.860 --> 50:26.757
Preacher! Preacher!

50:26.831 --> 50:28.460
I didn't kill Pete!

50:28.485 --> 50:29.851
I didn't kill anyone!

50:30.215 --> 50:31.915
Preacher!

50:38.371 --> 50:39.565
What are you doing to do?

50:39.590 --> 50:43.201
I'm gonna find the devil
who's behind this.

50:58.480 --> 51:00.880
I thought you'd never find me.

51:01.127 --> 51:04.851
You look different
than the last time I saw you.

51:05.100 --> 51:06.866
You killed two men in this town.

51:06.932 --> 51:10.172
Guess the Lord works in mysterious ways.

51:10.403 --> 51:11.947
Wanna try and add a third?

51:11.971 --> 51:14.171
No, see, I'm familiar with my limits.

51:14.508 --> 51:17.531
Your work in this town is done.

51:18.043 --> 51:19.909
So leave while you can.

51:20.046 --> 51:22.179
Or else what, Preacher?

51:22.402 --> 51:25.237
You're gonna save my poor immortal soul?

51:31.924 --> 51:34.393
No, I'll kill you...

51:34.633 --> 51:37.000
and drag you to hell with me.

51:51.310 --> 51:53.043
Who was that?

51:58.603 --> 52:00.836
My little brother.

52:02.855 --> 52:05.177
Now, you be good. You be good, boy.

52:05.202 --> 52:07.505
I didn't kill anybody!
I didn't kill Pete!

52:07.530 --> 52:09.044
You settle, boy.

52:09.272 --> 52:11.005
You want some roughhouse?

53:00.699 --> 53:02.165
It is begun.
