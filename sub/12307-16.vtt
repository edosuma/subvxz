WEBVTT

00:01.332 --> 00:02.573
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.573 --> 00:03.703
(Tyler) EMILY'S NOT
YOUR FRIEND, AMANDA.

00:03.703 --> 00:05.436
YOU NEED MORE PROOF?

00:05.436 --> 00:06.607
(clatters)

00:06.607 --> 00:08.079
I CALLED YOUR LAWYER

00:08.079 --> 00:09.380
AND HAD HER SEND OVER
THE DIVORCE PAPERS.

00:09.380 --> 00:11.011
IT'S TIME TO END THIS.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.084
YOUR FAMILY
HAS BEEN CALLING NONSTOP.

00:13.084 --> 00:14.285
YOU GOTTA FACE 'EM EVENTUALLY.

00:14.285 --> 00:15.486
TAKE THE BOX.

00:15.486 --> 00:18.149
BURY YOUR FATHER'S SECRETS
AWAY FROM HERE.

00:18.149 --> 00:19.320
COME TO PARIS WITH ME.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.222
I CAN'T.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.694
HELLO, DANNY.

00:23.694 --> 00:25.056
(gunshots)

00:25.056 --> 00:27.058
NO! NO, NO, NO! AMANDA!

00:27.058 --> 00:28.559
MY GOD.
 I-I DIDN'T.

00:28.559 --> 00:30.631
GO. MY TRUCK'S UP THE ROAD.

00:30.631 --> 00:31.732
THE KEYS ARE INSIDE.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.334
(cell phone rings)

00:33.334 --> 00:34.805
HEY!

00:34.805 --> 00:36.737
(Charlotte) MOM!

00:36.737 --> 00:38.239
(Ashley) IT'S TYLER.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.670
MOM?

00:41.672 --> 00:43.114
I...

00:43.114 --> 00:45.816
(whispers) DON'T SAY A WORD.

00:45.816 --> 00:48.479
(people speaking indistinctly)

00:48.479 --> 00:51.282
(police radio chatter)

00:51.282 --> 00:53.424
(Emily) MY FATHER'S
FALSE IMPRISONMENT

00:53.424 --> 00:55.626
TAUGHT ME THAT IN A CRISIS

00:55.626 --> 01:00.131
YOU QUICKLY FIND OUT
WHO YOUR REAL FRIENDS ARE.

01:00.131 --> 01:02.263
TRAGEDY AND SCANDAL,
IT SEEMS,

01:02.263 --> 01:07.198
HAVE A UNIQUE WAY OF
CLARIFYING PEOPLE'S PRIORITIES.

01:07.198 --> 01:08.499
(siren wails,
camera shutter clicks)

01:08.499 --> 01:10.401
(Charlotte) WE HEARD
A CELL PHONE RING

01:10.401 --> 01:13.073
UP BY THE SAND DUNE.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.506
I SAW SOMEONE
IN A DARK HOODIE

01:15.506 --> 01:18.209
HIDING BEHIND THE SAW GRASS.

01:18.209 --> 01:19.410
I DON'T KNOW.
IT COULD'VE BEEN A HOODIE.

01:19.410 --> 01:21.182
IT COULD'VE BEEN ANYTHING,
LIKE A GUEST FROM THE PARTY.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.483
IT'S HARD TO SAY.

01:22.483 --> 01:25.116
TYLER WASN'T A BAD PERSON.
HE--HE WAS SICK.

01:25.116 --> 01:26.787
THE GUY WENT ALL BENIHANA
ON MY ARM

01:26.787 --> 01:28.259
AND TIED ME TO A CHAIR.

01:28.259 --> 01:30.121
THAT BOY WAS A MENACE.

01:30.121 --> 01:31.522
IF YOU PEOPLE HAD BEEN
DOING YOUR JOBS,

01:31.522 --> 01:33.264
YOU'D HAVE MADE SURE
THE LITTLE PSYCHOPATH

01:33.264 --> 01:37.228
STAYED LOCKED UP AFTER HOLDING
US ALL HOSTAGE AT GUNPOINT.

01:37.228 --> 01:39.130
WHEN I WENT HOME
TO GET DANIEL CLOTHES,

01:39.130 --> 01:41.101
I SAW THAT MY GUN WAS MISSING.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.704
I'D LEFT A WINDOW OPEN.
TYLER MUST HAVE...

01:43.704 --> 01:47.107
BROKEN IN AND STOLEN IT
WHILE WE WERE AT THE PARTY.

01:47.107 --> 01:50.741
SO WHAT WERE YOU
AND MR. BARROL FIGHTING ABOUT?

01:50.741 --> 01:52.613
I DON'T REMEMBER A FIGHT.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.685
YOU HAVE 15 STITCHES
IN YOUR HEAD.

01:54.685 --> 01:57.148
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

01:57.148 --> 01:58.589
TYLER HAD A HISTORY
OF VIOLENCE,

01:58.589 --> 02:00.291
HE THREATENED
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY

02:00.291 --> 02:02.723
AT YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY.

02:02.723 --> 02:05.826
LOOK, I CAN UNDERSTAND

02:05.826 --> 02:08.429
IF YOU FELT LIKE
YOUR LIFE WAS IN DANGER...

02:08.429 --> 02:12.533
YOU SHOT HIM, DIDN'T YOU?

02:12.533 --> 02:14.405
(whispers)
DON'T SAY A WORD.

02:16.807 --> 02:20.140
I DON'T REMEMBER.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.147
(people speaking indistinctly)

02:32.152 --> 02:34.485
MR. AND MRS. GRAYSON,

02:34.485 --> 02:37.228
YOU'VE HAD A VERY BUSY
FEW MONTHS HERE IN THE HAMPTONS.

02:37.228 --> 02:38.729
ARE YOU CHARGING HIM?

02:38.729 --> 02:39.790
NOT YET,

02:39.790 --> 02:41.492
BUT IF YOU'RE PLANNING
ON JOINING

02:41.492 --> 02:43.494
THE LABOR DAY EXODUS
TO THE CITY,

02:43.494 --> 02:44.835
DON'T.

02:44.835 --> 02:46.597
WELL, THEN WE'RE
GOING TO BE TAKING HIM HOME.

02:46.597 --> 02:48.639
IN CASE IT'S LOST UPON YOU,
HE HAS SEVERE HEAD INJURY.

02:48.639 --> 02:51.802
HE'S ALSO COVERED IN BLOOD,
PRESUMABLY THE VICTIM'S,

02:51.802 --> 02:53.344
WHO WAS
APPARENTLY KILLED BY BULLETS

02:53.344 --> 02:55.276
FIRED FROM HIS FIANCEE'S GUN.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.278
NO, WE STILL HAVE
A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.909
YEAH,
WHICH WON'T BE ANSWERED

02:58.909 --> 03:00.351
UNTIL HIS LAWYER IS PRESENT.

03:00.351 --> 03:01.852
OR DO YOU WANT ME TO CALL HIM
RIGHT NOW

03:01.852 --> 03:04.255
AND JUST LET HIM KNOW THAT MY
SON'S RIGHTS ARE BEING VIOLATED?

03:04.255 --> 03:06.317
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

03:06.317 --> 03:08.489
(man) MR. GRAYSON,
COME WITH ME.

03:08.489 --> 03:12.323
(police radio chatter)

03:14.525 --> 03:16.196
COME ON.
LET'S GO HOME.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.728
WE HAVE A CAR WAITING
FOR YOU.

03:17.728 --> 03:19.730
I'M GONNA GO WITH EMILY,

03:19.730 --> 03:21.972
BUT I NEED TO SPEAK
TO MY MOTHER FIRST...

03:21.972 --> 03:23.574
ALONE.

03:23.574 --> 03:25.836
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

03:25.836 --> 03:28.839
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

03:36.687 --> 03:38.849
SMART MOVE,
RUNNING BACK TO THE HOUSE

03:38.849 --> 03:40.351
TO CREATE A COVER

03:40.351 --> 03:42.222
FOR HOW TYLER GOT YOUR GUN.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.454
IT MIGHT NOT EVEN MATTER.

03:43.454 --> 03:44.925
TYLER COULD'VE
TOLD DANIEL EVERYTHING.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.727
TYLER'S NOT EXACTLY
A RELIABLE SOURCE,

03:46.727 --> 03:49.860
AND... DANIEL LOVES YOU.

03:49.860 --> 03:51.362
(speaking inaudibly)

03:51.362 --> 03:53.534
UNLESS THAT'S CHANGED.

03:53.534 --> 03:54.705
(speaks indistinctly)

03:54.705 --> 03:57.768
(sighs) WE HAD AN ARGUMENT
AT THE PARTY.

03:57.768 --> 03:59.270
I'M NOT SURE WHERE WE STAND.

03:59.270 --> 04:02.242
WELL, YOU'RE STANDING
IN A POLICE STATION,

04:02.242 --> 04:03.544
AND I WOULD SAY
THE MORE PRESSING ISSUE

04:03.544 --> 04:05.976
IS THE WHEREABOUTS OF
YOUR FATHER'S INFINITY BOX.

04:05.976 --> 04:08.619
IT'S SAFE AND SOUND.

04:08.619 --> 04:11.021
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

04:11.021 --> 04:12.783
YOU READY TO GO?

04:14.425 --> 04:16.957
YEAH.

04:21.332 --> 04:23.994
ARE YOU OKAY?

04:25.466 --> 04:28.639
WHAT WERE YOU TALKING
TO YOUR MOTHER ABOUT?

04:30.371 --> 04:31.842
WE HAD WORDS AT THE PARTY.

04:31.842 --> 04:33.974
I JUST...

04:33.974 --> 04:36.547
I JUST WANTED
TO CLEAR THE AIR.

04:36.547 --> 04:39.310
THAT'S GOOD.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED...

04:39.310 --> 04:42.753
AS MUCH SUPPORT
AS YOU CAN GET RIGHT NOW.

04:46.357 --> 04:49.520
DANIEL, WHAT HAPPENED ON
THE BEACH WITH YOU AND TYLER?

04:53.364 --> 04:54.865
WHAT'S THIS?

04:54.865 --> 04:57.398
WHY DON'T WE CALL
YOUR FIANCEE AND ASK HER?

04:58.699 --> 05:00.831
UNDERNEATH HER

05:02.302 --> 05:04.475
I DON'T REMEMBER.

05:07.478 --> 05:08.439
(door opens)

05:10.441 --> 05:12.443
I HAD THE COOK
SET UP SOME BREAKFAST

05:12.443 --> 05:13.744
IN CASE YOU'RE HUNGRY.

05:13.744 --> 05:15.586
I'VE ALSO BEEN TRACKING
THE MEDIA COVERAGE

05:15.586 --> 05:16.917
OF DANIEL ONLINE.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.449
(Conrad) WAIT A SECOND.
WAIT. HOW, UH...

05:18.449 --> 05:19.590
WHO ALERTED THE MEDIA?

05:19.590 --> 05:21.021
WELL, THERE'S A PICTURE
ONLINE OF DANIEL

05:21.021 --> 05:22.353
IN HIS BLOODY TUX.

05:22.353 --> 05:23.854
SOMEONE FROM THE PARTY
MUST HAVE SNAPPED IT.

05:23.854 --> 05:25.356
OH, WELL, SO MUCH
FOR DECORUM.

05:25.356 --> 05:27.498
SHE'S RIGHT.
IT'S EVERYWHERE.

05:27.498 --> 05:28.659
(cell phone beeps)

05:28.659 --> 05:30.501
"BLOODY BILLIONAIRE
BEACH BATTLE"?

05:30.501 --> 05:32.633
DO THE POLICE REALLY THINK
DANIEL KILLED TYLER?

05:32.633 --> 05:34.334
OF COURSE NOT.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.636
WELL, DAD TOOK THE HELICOPTER
INTO THE CITY.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.337
WHEN IT RETURNS,
I'VE MADE SURE

05:37.337 --> 05:38.769
THE BEST DEFENSE ATTORNEY
IN MANHATTAN

05:38.769 --> 05:40.110
IS GONNA BE ON BOARD.

05:40.110 --> 05:41.842
ASHLEY, COULD YOU PLEASE
GET ME AN ASPIRIN?

05:41.842 --> 05:43.013
OF COURSE.

05:43.013 --> 05:44.515
I THINK HER TIME
WOULD BE BETTER SPENT

05:44.515 --> 05:46.377
TRYING TO GET
THAT PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN DOWN.

05:46.377 --> 05:47.518
OKAY, I'LL CALL NOLAN ROSS

05:47.518 --> 05:49.980
AND SEE IF WE CAN HAVE ACCESS
TO HIS TECH TEAM.

05:49.980 --> 05:52.623
AND YOU SHOULD GET TO BED,
YOUNG LADY.

05:52.623 --> 05:54.354
GET SOME REST.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.427
THE NEXT FEW DAYS
ARE GONNA BE CHALLENGING.

05:56.427 --> 05:58.389
I'M ONLY HERE
TO PICK UP CLOTHES.

05:58.389 --> 05:59.960
I'M GOING BACK TO DECLAN'S.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.892
SWEETHEART, WE NEED YOU
TO STAY HERE.

06:01.892 --> 06:03.634
YOUR BROTHER'S
IN REAL TROUBLE,

06:03.634 --> 06:05.496
AND WE NEED TO STAY TOGETHER
AS A FAMILY.

06:05.496 --> 06:06.467
YOUR MOTHER'S RIGHT.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.768
WE NEED TO PRESENT
A UNITED FRONT.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.540
FINE.

06:09.540 --> 06:11.542
I'LL MOVE BACK IN
WHEN YOU DO.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.777
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

06:22.052 --> 06:24.154
YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED.

06:24.154 --> 06:26.687
HEY, SAMMY.

06:28.959 --> 06:31.722
YOU SHOULD TAKE HIM
FOR A WALK.

06:34.465 --> 06:35.966
I WILL.

06:35.966 --> 06:38.499
JUST GONNA CHANGE FIRST.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.593
WHERE YOU BEEN?

07:02.593 --> 07:04.455
OH, JEEZ. DEC.

07:04.455 --> 07:06.957
YOU SCARED THE HELL
OUTTA ME.

07:06.957 --> 07:08.459
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN HERE?

07:08.459 --> 07:10.601
I'VE BEEN WONDERING
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

07:10.601 --> 07:13.504
I THOUGHT YOU SAILED OFF
TO HAITI.

07:13.504 --> 07:14.665
(keys clatter)

07:14.665 --> 07:16.607
MY ENGINE CRAPPED OUT.

07:16.607 --> 07:19.009
YEAH.

07:19.009 --> 07:21.742
I FIGURED THAT WHEN I SAW
THE "AMANDA" IN HER SLIP

07:21.742 --> 07:24.545
AN HOUR AGO.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.917
SO WHERE YOU BEEN
ALL THIS TIME?

07:26.917 --> 07:28.619
IT'S 5:00
IN THE MORNING, MAN.

07:28.619 --> 07:30.981
WHY AREN'T YOU SLEEPING?

07:30.981 --> 07:34.054
WELL, IT'S BEEN
A CRAZY NIGHT.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.456
TYLER WAS MURDERED.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.091
TYLER?

07:41.091 --> 07:44.134
ME AND CHARLOTTE FOUND HIM.

07:44.134 --> 07:47.467
AND DANIEL POPS UP FROM A DUNE,
COVERED IN BLOOD.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.470
THAT'S--THAT'S INSANE.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.242
ARE--ARE YOU OKAY?
 FINE.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.475
CHARLOTTE'S A WRECK, THOUGH.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.477
SHE TOLD THE COPS
THAT SHE SAW

07:57.477 --> 08:01.181
SOME GUY IN A HOODIE
ON THE BEACH BY TYLER'S BODY.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.713
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

08:03.884 --> 08:05.686
I WAS TOO FAR AWAY.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.589
I DIDN'T GET A GOOD LOOK
AT HIS FACE.

08:08.589 --> 08:11.161
I'M GONNA CRASH.

08:15.866 --> 08:17.698
(Sammy whines)

08:17.698 --> 08:18.899
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:18.899 --> 08:20.170
LOOKING FOR ANSWERS.

08:20.170 --> 08:21.802
(sighs)

08:26.577 --> 08:28.779
WHAT IS THIS?

08:28.779 --> 08:30.110
(exhales)

08:30.110 --> 08:33.683
I DON'T KNOW. IT MUST BELONG
TO THE PREVIOUS OWNER.

08:33.683 --> 08:35.015
HOW DID YOU--

08:35.015 --> 08:37.548
TYLER TOLD ME
YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING ME,

08:37.548 --> 08:40.691
THAT YOU HAD SECRETS HIDDEN
UNDERNEATH THE FLOORBOARDS.

08:42.553 --> 08:43.754
DANIEL,

08:43.754 --> 08:46.727
TYLER WAS CRAZY.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.929
HE WAS A LIAR.

08:50.631 --> 08:53.203
HE HELD US AT GUNPOINT.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.707
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

08:56.707 --> 08:58.739
NO. (sighs)

08:58.739 --> 09:01.041
YOU DON'T NEED
TO APOLOGIZE.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.645
YOU'RE INJURED,
YOU'RE TRAUMATIZED.

09:07.117 --> 09:10.681
I LOVE YOU, DANIEL.

09:10.681 --> 09:14.054
I'M GONNA BE BY YOUR SIDE
NO MATTER WHAT.

09:16.687 --> 09:19.760
COME ON.
YOU NEED TO GET SOME SLEEP.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.579
♪♪♪

09:46.116 --> 09:47.287
AS OF NOW,

09:47.287 --> 09:49.289
DANIEL HASN'T BEEN CHARGED
WITH ANYTHING.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.991
ALL WE KNOW IS,

09:50.991 --> 09:53.624
TYLER BARROL APPEARS
TO HAVE BEEN SHOT TO DEATH

09:53.624 --> 09:55.125
AND DANIEL WAS FOUND
UNCONSCIOUS AT THE SCENE

09:55.125 --> 09:57.027
WITH SOME BLOOD ON HIM.

09:57.027 --> 09:59.029
EVERYONE'S WAITING
ON THE CORONER'S REPORT

09:59.029 --> 10:01.071
AS WELL AS THE RESULTS
FROM YOUR FINGERPRINT

10:01.071 --> 10:03.734
AND GUNSHOT RESIDUE TEST.

10:03.734 --> 10:07.137
UNTIL THOSE COME BACK, WE WON'T
KNOW WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST.

10:07.137 --> 10:08.709
MR. BROOKS,

10:08.709 --> 10:10.140
I WANT TO TELL YOU
HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE

10:10.140 --> 10:11.982
THAT YOU'VE AGREED
TO REPRESENT DANIEL

10:11.982 --> 10:13.684
AND THAT YOU CAN COUNT ON
MY HUSBAND AND I

10:13.684 --> 10:15.115
TO WORK AS A TEAM.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.247
WHERE IS YOUR HUSBAND?

10:21.091 --> 10:24.194
MR. BROOKS WAS KIND ENOUGH
NOT TO QUESTION YOUR ABSENCE,

10:24.194 --> 10:27.027
BUT I AM NOT FEELING
SO INDULGENT.

10:27.027 --> 10:30.831
I HAVEN'T SLEPT.
I'M TIRED.

10:30.831 --> 10:34.164
AND I DIDN'T WANT
OUR HISTORY CLOUDING THE ROOM.

10:34.164 --> 10:36.006
(man) 246 FATALITIES

10:36.006 --> 10:37.938
IN THE BOMBING OF FLIGHT 197.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.970
THE FINAL DEATH TOLL
WILL LIKELY SURGE

10:39.970 --> 10:41.371
TO INCLUDE
THE MANY UNACCOUNTED FOR...

10:41.371 --> 10:43.073
CONRAD, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

10:43.073 --> 10:44.414
ON THE GROUND.

10:44.414 --> 10:45.976
A HOMEGROWN GROUP
OF VIOLENT RADICALS...

10:45.976 --> 10:47.948
WHAT IS IT?

10:47.948 --> 10:49.279
CALLING THEMSELVES
THE AMERICON INITIATIVE...

10:49.279 --> 10:52.853
(exhales) I'VE MADE
A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.255
THE PRESIDENT,
AWAKENED LAST NIGHT TO NEWS...

10:55.255 --> 10:58.128
UH, YOU KNOW THE PLANE
THAT WENT DOWN,

10:58.128 --> 10:59.930
FLIGHT 197?

10:59.930 --> 11:01.661
(man speaking indistinctly
on TV)

11:01.661 --> 11:04.094
I'M RESPONSIBLE.

11:04.094 --> 11:06.366
WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:06.366 --> 11:08.398
THAT GROUP
THAT CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY

11:08.398 --> 11:09.940
FOR THE BOMBING,

11:09.940 --> 11:12.973
I WAS LAUNDERING MONEY
FOR THEM.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.905
CONRAD.

11:14.905 --> 11:16.907
THE INVESTIGATION'S GONNA
TIE BACK TO THE COMPANY.

11:16.907 --> 11:19.049
I'M GONNA GO TO PRISON
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

11:19.049 --> 11:20.380
IF I'M LUCKY.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.152
THEY'RE GONNA FREEZE
ALL OF OUR ASSETS,

11:22.152 --> 11:24.054
AND YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO RAISE DANIEL ALONE

11:24.054 --> 11:26.116
UNDER A CLOUD OF DISGRACE.

11:26.116 --> 11:28.218
(man continues
speaking indistinctly)

11:28.218 --> 11:32.162
LIFE AS WE KNOW IT, VICTORIA,

11:32.162 --> 11:34.424
IS OVER.

11:34.424 --> 11:38.929
NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE TRY
TO ESCAPE OUR PAST,

11:38.929 --> 11:41.031
WE SEEM DESTINED
TO REPEAT IT.

11:41.031 --> 11:43.173
LIKE IT OR NOT,
WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER,

11:43.173 --> 11:45.806
AGAIN.

11:45.806 --> 11:46.977
(Sammy pants and whines)

11:46.977 --> 11:49.109
(Jack) GOOD TO SEE YOU,
OLD TIMER.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.410
GOOD BOY.

11:54.845 --> 11:56.817
JACK.

11:58.048 --> 11:59.249
SHOULDN'T YOU BE ON A BOAT

11:59.249 --> 12:00.791
HALFWAY TO HAITI RIGHT NOW?

12:00.791 --> 12:03.924
YEAH, WELL, MY ENGINE
HAD OTHER IDEAS.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.826
YOU OKAY?

12:08.258 --> 12:10.260
YEAH, I'M FINE.

12:10.260 --> 12:12.202
IT'S DANIEL
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

12:12.202 --> 12:13.363
(Sammy whines)

12:13.363 --> 12:16.436
THE POLICE WERE
QUESTIONING HIM PRETTY HARD.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.909
DO THEY HAVE
ANY OTHER SUSPECTS?

12:18.909 --> 12:22.342
I DON'T KNOW. THEY'RE NOT
REALLY KEEPING US IN THE LOOP.

12:24.474 --> 12:26.046
HOW'S DECLAN?

12:26.046 --> 12:28.048
FINDING TYLER'S BODY
MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY AWFUL.

12:28.048 --> 12:32.322
YEAH, HE'S, UH,
HE'S PLAYING IT COOL, BUT...

12:32.322 --> 12:34.184
I'M NOT BUYING IT.

12:35.525 --> 12:37.227
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD FROM AMANDA,

12:37.227 --> 12:39.129
BY ANY CHANCE, HAVE YOU?

12:39.129 --> 12:41.231
NO.

12:41.231 --> 12:43.033
STILL NO LUCK
GETTING AHOLD OF HER?

12:43.033 --> 12:45.535
NO, HER PHONE'S DISCONNECTED.

12:45.535 --> 12:47.798
(sighs)

12:49.870 --> 12:51.972
ANYWAY, THANK YOU

12:51.972 --> 12:54.074
FOR LOOKING AFTER SAMMY.

12:54.074 --> 12:57.007
ANYTIME.

12:57.007 --> 12:58.178
(Sammy whines)

12:58.178 --> 12:59.149
(clicks tongue)

13:01.411 --> 13:03.553
I NEED TO SEE
WHAT HAPPENED ON JACK'S BOAT.

13:03.553 --> 13:05.085
HE NEVER LEFT TOWN.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.888
WHAT? HE SHOULD BE DOWN
AROUND THE OUTER BANKS BY NOW.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.189
TRY MY BACK PORCH.

13:09.189 --> 13:12.062
NO, I SWEAR,
HE LEFT THE HARBOR.

13:12.062 --> 13:14.094
I SAW HIM OR...

13:14.094 --> 13:17.197
AT LEAST, UH, SHAMU DID.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.129
(beeps and whooshes)

13:19.129 --> 13:22.933
(engine starts)

13:24.274 --> 13:26.406
SEE? WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

13:26.406 --> 13:28.108
(Amanda) JACK!

13:28.108 --> 13:29.279
JACK, WAIT!

13:29.279 --> 13:31.511
AMANDA?

13:31.511 --> 13:33.283
(turns engine off)
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:33.283 --> 13:35.245
MEA CULPA, BABE.

13:35.245 --> 13:36.887
JACK SAID
HE HAD ENGINE TROUBLE

13:36.887 --> 13:38.188
AND THE LAST TIME HE SAW
AMANDA WAS LAST WEEK.

13:38.188 --> 13:39.819
WHY WOULD HE LIE TO ME?

13:39.819 --> 13:43.123
PROBABLY BECAUSE HE'S COVERING
UP ANOTHER ONE OF HER MESSES.

13:43.123 --> 13:46.156
TALK TO HIM. SEE IF YOU CAN
FIND OUT WHY AMANDA CAME BACK.

13:46.156 --> 13:48.258
AND WHERE SHE'S BEEN HIDING,
RIGHT?

13:48.258 --> 13:50.830
ESPECIALLY THAT.

13:57.307 --> 13:59.309
HEY, CHARLOTTE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:59.309 --> 14:00.610
(sets glass down)

14:00.610 --> 14:02.472
I BARELY SLEPT
LAST NIGHT.

14:02.472 --> 14:04.274
MY HEAD IS POUNDING.

14:04.274 --> 14:06.076
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THESE PAST FEW DAYS

14:06.076 --> 14:07.517
HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR ME--
FINDING OUT

14:07.517 --> 14:09.279
DAVID CLARKE IS MY FATHER,

14:09.279 --> 14:11.281
AND NOW DANIEL GETTING
WRAPPED UP

14:11.281 --> 14:13.283
IN TYLER'S
MURDER INVESTIGATION,

14:13.283 --> 14:15.485
KNOWING HOW CLOSE
WE PROBABLY CAME

14:15.485 --> 14:18.328
TO GETTING KILLED, TOO...

14:18.328 --> 14:21.331
BY THAT CREEPY GUY
IN THE HOODIE.

14:21.331 --> 14:25.235
UH, WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
CALL THAT SHRINK AGAIN.

14:25.235 --> 14:28.198
YOU SAID
SHE REALLY HELPED LAST TIME.

14:28.198 --> 14:30.170
TALKING'S OVERRATED.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.042
AND TAKING PILLS ISN'T?

14:32.042 --> 14:35.245
WERE YOU HIGH LAST NIGHT?

14:35.245 --> 14:36.546
COME ON, CHARLOTTE.

14:36.546 --> 14:39.179
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
THE SMART ONE HERE.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.311
AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
ON MY SIDE.

14:41.311 --> 14:43.914
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

14:43.914 --> 14:45.655
I'VE HAD ENOUGH INTERROGATION
FOR ONE WEEKEND.

14:45.655 --> 14:47.317
(door opens)

14:47.317 --> 14:48.488
(door closes)

14:48.488 --> 14:49.960
(sighs)

14:49.960 --> 14:52.963
(footsteps approaching)

14:59.970 --> 15:01.401
WE SHOULD'VE GONE TO PARIS.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.373
I KNOW.

15:03.373 --> 15:04.674
I'M SO SORRY.

15:04.674 --> 15:07.177
HAMPTONS POLICE DEPARTMENT.

15:07.177 --> 15:08.608
JUST A MINUTE.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.580
(knocks)
 THEY'RE GONNA FRY ME,
AREN'T THEY?

15:10.580 --> 15:12.112
NO. NO.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.413
NO, I'M NOT GONNA
LET THAT HAPPEN, OKAY?

15:13.413 --> 15:14.945
MS. THORNE,
HAMPTONS POLICE DEPARTMENT.

15:14.945 --> 15:16.286
OKAY?

15:16.286 --> 15:17.487
(knocking)

15:17.487 --> 15:20.390
MS. THORNE, WE HAVE A WARRANT
FOR DANIEL'S ARREST.

15:20.390 --> 15:22.622
OPEN THE DOOR NOW.

15:24.995 --> 15:26.296
(lock clicks)

15:26.296 --> 15:28.328
(door opens)

15:30.000 --> 15:31.161
THAT'S HIM.

15:31.161 --> 15:32.462
(man) SIR.
 DANIEL GRAYSON,

15:32.462 --> 15:34.464
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE MURDER OF TYLER BARROL.

15:34.464 --> 15:36.336
(handcuffs click)

15:36.336 --> 15:37.407
(click)

15:39.269 --> 15:40.470
YOU DON'T HAVE TO--
 STAY BACK.

15:48.418 --> 15:52.182
(sound distorts) DANIEL.
TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF MY SON!

16:01.731 --> 16:03.093
(Brooks) DANIEL'S FINGERPRINTS
WERE FOUND ON EMILY'S GUN.

16:03.093 --> 16:04.394
HE HANDLED THAT GUN
A DOZEN TIMES.

16:04.394 --> 16:06.066
HIS HANDS WERE TESTED POSITIVE
FOR GUNSHOT RESIDUE.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.567
THE BLOOD SPLATTER
ON HIS TUXEDO

16:07.567 --> 16:09.699
WAS THE SAME TYPE
AS TYLER'S.

16:09.699 --> 16:11.201
IN A POLITICAL CLIMATE
LIKE THIS,

16:11.201 --> 16:14.144
THE D.A. GOES
FIRST-DEGREE MURDER.

16:14.144 --> 16:18.308
(people speaking indistinctly)

16:18.308 --> 16:19.709
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S TIME YOU TOLD US

16:19.709 --> 16:21.981
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
ON THAT BEACH, SON.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.983
IT'S OKAY.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.555
DO IT.

16:27.517 --> 16:31.391
TYLER WAS TALKING CRAZY,
WAVING THE GUN AROUND.

16:31.391 --> 16:34.694
WE HAD A STRUGGLE, AND I MANAGED
TO GET AHOLD OF IT.

16:36.366 --> 16:38.298
AND THEN HE CHARGED AT ME.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.669
KEEP GOING.

16:39.669 --> 16:41.501
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

16:41.501 --> 16:43.433
SO I FIRED.

16:43.433 --> 16:44.574
THREE TIMES?

16:44.574 --> 16:46.406
ONCE,
THEN I BLACKED OUT.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.139
NEXT THING I REMEMBER WAS
MY MOTHER CALLING MY NAME.

16:49.139 --> 16:51.010
TYLER WAS SHOT
THREE TIMES.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.642
ONCE IN THE CHEST,
TWICE THE BACK.

16:52.642 --> 16:54.084
I DIDN'T SHOOT TYLER
IN THE BACK.

16:54.084 --> 16:55.485
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

16:55.485 --> 16:58.248
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU BLACKED OUT.

16:58.248 --> 17:01.351
WHEN YOU AND TYLER STRUGGLED...

17:01.351 --> 17:03.022
WHERE DID HE HIT YOU?

17:03.022 --> 17:05.595
RIGHT HERE,
ON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.402
THERE'S A HEMATOMA
ON THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD.

17:12.402 --> 17:15.805
THAT'S A HARD SPOT TO REACH
IF YOU'RE FIGHTING FACE-TO-FACE.

17:15.805 --> 17:17.807
WE CAN USE IT
TO FLOAT THE THEORY

17:17.807 --> 17:21.040
THERE WAS A THIRD PERSON
ON THE BEACH

17:21.040 --> 17:22.172
THAT KNOCKED YOU OUT,

17:22.172 --> 17:24.074
SET YOU UP.

17:24.074 --> 17:26.715
YOU'RE RICH.
WHO HATES YOU--

17:26.715 --> 17:29.519
DISGRUNTLED INVESTORS,
HOSTILE COMPETITORS?

17:29.519 --> 17:30.820
AMANDA CLARKE.

17:30.820 --> 17:33.153
AH. GREAT.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.185
WHERE CAN WE FIND HER?

17:35.185 --> 17:37.827
(reporters shouting
indistinctly)

17:37.827 --> 17:41.060
(camera shutters clicking)

17:41.060 --> 17:42.562
(clicking and shouting continue)

17:42.562 --> 17:44.434
(woman) MRS. GRAYSON.
MRS. GRAYSON.

17:44.434 --> 17:46.136
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO HAVE YOUR SON

17:46.136 --> 17:47.637
FACING LIFE IN PRISON?

17:47.637 --> 17:49.339
(man) MR. GRAYSON, WHAT AFFECT
WILL A MURDER TRIAL

17:49.339 --> 17:51.201
HAVE ON GRAYSON GLOBAL STOCK?
 (woman) MRS. GRAYSON.

17:51.201 --> 17:53.773
THE GRAYSON FAMILY
HAVE NO COMMENT...

17:53.773 --> 17:55.105
(woman) DO YOU THINK
YOUR SON DID IT?

17:55.105 --> 17:59.309
EXCEPT TO SAY THAT DANIEL
IS INNOCENT OF THE CHARGES

17:59.309 --> 18:02.152
AND THEY'RE SURE THAT JUSTICE
WILL BE SERVED.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.322
(door clatters)

18:14.124 --> 18:16.226
AMANDA?

18:41.151 --> 18:43.122
VICTORIA.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.325
COME ON IN.

18:48.428 --> 18:52.732
WELL, WHEN YOU AND DANIEL
DECIDED TO GET MARRIED,

18:52.732 --> 18:55.435
YOU PROBABLY NEVER WOULD'VE
DREAMED THAT YOUR ENGAGEMENT

18:55.435 --> 18:58.268
WOULD HAVE INCLUDED
A... MURDER INVESTIGATION.

18:58.268 --> 18:59.469
(chuckles)

18:59.469 --> 19:02.242
I DON'T THINK ANYONE
COULD IMAGINE

19:02.242 --> 19:04.714
SOMETHING SO HORRIBLE.

19:06.676 --> 19:08.648
WELL, UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

19:08.648 --> 19:11.651
I WOULD UNDERSTAND
IF YOU WERE REEVALUATING

19:11.651 --> 19:14.754
THE FUTURE
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

19:17.287 --> 19:20.190
SO... (chuckles)

19:20.190 --> 19:24.734
THIS IS MY ENGAGEMENT PRESENT
TO THE TWO OF YOU.

19:24.734 --> 19:26.796
YOU WANT ME
TO OPEN IT NOW?

19:26.796 --> 19:29.399
NO.

19:29.399 --> 19:32.202
I WANT YOU TO HOLD ON TO IT.

19:32.202 --> 19:35.205
AND I NEED TO KNOW THAT YOU'LL
STAND BY DANIEL'S SIDE

19:35.205 --> 19:37.347
NO MATTER HOW ROUGH
THE ROAD GETS.

19:37.347 --> 19:38.848
IF YOU ABANDON HIM,

19:38.848 --> 19:42.282
IT'LL SEND A VERY PUBLIC MESSAGE
ABOUT HIS INNOCENCE.

19:42.282 --> 19:45.655
HONESTLY, THAT NEVER EVEN
CROSSED MY MIND.

19:49.689 --> 19:50.860
EMILY.

19:50.860 --> 19:53.223
VICTORIA.

19:53.223 --> 19:54.964
WHY DID YOU COME BACK
TO THIS HOUSE

19:54.964 --> 19:57.327
WHEN WE WERE ALL
AT THE POLICE STATION?

19:58.368 --> 20:01.231
I KNEW THAT THEY WOULD
TAKE DANIEL'S SUIT.

20:01.231 --> 20:03.373
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT
HE HAD A CHANGE OF CLOTHING

20:03.373 --> 20:04.634
FOR WHEN THEY DID.

20:06.236 --> 20:07.777
WELL,
THAT WAS QUICK THINKING.

20:09.739 --> 20:12.412
MAYBE YOUR TIME IN
THE JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITY

20:12.412 --> 20:15.915
WILL END UP BEING AN ASSET
IN DANIEL'S COURT CASE.

20:28.227 --> 20:32.001
I GOT A PROBLEM AND I DON'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO GO.

20:32.001 --> 20:35.765
UH, OH, WELCOME TO
THE CONE OF SILENCE.

20:37.367 --> 20:39.238
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

20:39.238 --> 20:40.870
A... WIRE RECEIPT

20:40.870 --> 20:42.912
FOR $5 MILLION.

20:42.912 --> 20:44.914
SOMEONE SENT IT
FROM THE SOUTHAMPTON TRUST

20:44.914 --> 20:46.746
TO A SMALL BANK
OUTSIDE OF MONTREAL.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.247
I CALLED THE BANK,
BUT I COULDN'T GET 'EM

20:48.247 --> 20:51.020
TO GIVE ME ANY INFORMATION
ON WHO IT CAME FROM.

20:51.020 --> 20:52.682
WAS IT YOU?

20:52.682 --> 20:54.384
(sighs)

20:54.384 --> 20:55.725
NO.

20:58.328 --> 20:59.529
THEN IT MUST HAVE BEEN
THE GRAYSONS.

21:01.661 --> 21:02.832
I THINK THIS HAD
SOMETHING TO DO

21:02.832 --> 21:04.364
WITH WHAT HAPPENED
ON THE BEACH.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.765
OH, REALLY, 'CAUSE YOU WANT
TO GET WRAPPED UP

21:05.765 --> 21:06.936
IN A MURDER INVESTIGATION?

21:06.936 --> 21:08.798
I ALREADY AM.

21:08.798 --> 21:10.600
THE RECEIPT
WAS IN AMANDA'S JACKET.

21:12.041 --> 21:14.043
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
SHE LEFT.

21:14.043 --> 21:15.705
SHE SHOWED UP THE OTHER NIGHT
AS I WAS HEADING OUT.

21:15.705 --> 21:18.978
WE WERE ALL SET TO GO TO HAITI,
AND SHE TOOK OFF.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.511
NOLAN...

21:21.511 --> 21:24.283
NOLAN, I FOLLOWED HER
TO THE BEACH.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.688
I SPENT HOURS
LOOKING FOR HER.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.520
I-I--DRIVING AROUND.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.861
SHE WAS GONE.

21:31.861 --> 21:33.993
PROBABLY STRAIGHT TO CANADA

21:33.993 --> 21:35.795
TO COLLECT THE $5 MIL.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.797
YOU ASKED FOR MY ADVICE

21:37.797 --> 21:39.729
SO I'M NOT
GONNA SUGARCOAT IT.

21:39.729 --> 21:42.001
THROW AWAY THE RECEIPT
AND LET IT GO.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.073
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,

21:44.073 --> 21:45.705
WHY DON'T YOU LET
AMANDA GO, TOO?

21:45.705 --> 21:48.077
I CAN'T DO THAT.

21:48.077 --> 21:50.480
JACK!

21:56.346 --> 21:58.047
(cell phone auto dials)

21:58.047 --> 21:59.949
This is Emily.
Leave a message.

21:59.949 --> 22:01.351
CALL ME...

22:01.351 --> 22:03.393
A-SAP.

22:03.393 --> 22:05.795
YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO SIT DOWN FOR THIS ONE.

22:05.795 --> 22:06.956
(beeps)

22:09.459 --> 22:12.432
DO YOU BELIEVE
DANIEL KILLED TYLER?

22:12.432 --> 22:14.564
OF COURSE NOT.

22:14.564 --> 22:16.406
THE STUFF THEY'RE SAYING
ABOUT HIM ONLINE,

22:16.406 --> 22:17.737
IT'S LIKE
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

22:17.737 --> 22:19.439
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
PERSON.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.010
THEY ARE.

22:22.942 --> 22:25.445
I JUST WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING
I COULD DO TO HELP HIM.

22:29.078 --> 22:30.580
IS THIS WHAT IT WAS LIKE
FOR YOU

22:30.580 --> 22:32.952
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT DAVID CLARKE
DID ALL THOSE HIDEOUS THINGS?

22:36.586 --> 22:39.689
DO YOU THINK ABOUT HIM
EVERY TIME YOU LOOK AT ME?

22:39.689 --> 22:41.591
CHARLOTTE.

22:41.591 --> 22:44.494
I WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT HIM, MOM,

22:44.494 --> 22:47.867
WHAT KIND OF PERSON HE WAS
WHEN HE WAS WITH YOU.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.870
IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE
A MILLION MILES AWAY.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.403
IF ONLY.

22:53.403 --> 22:56.406
YOU KNOW, MY AUNT CHARLOTTE

22:56.406 --> 22:58.608
HAS A FARM IN KANSAS--

22:58.608 --> 23:01.050
50 ACRES.

23:01.050 --> 23:04.684
WE COULD PACK OUR BAGS
AND LEAVE TONIGHT.

23:04.684 --> 23:07.957
I CAN'T LEAVE DANIEL
WITH CONRAD.

23:09.459 --> 23:10.720
WELL, WE CAN PACK
TWO BAGS,

23:10.720 --> 23:13.423
BRING THE KIDS WITH US.

23:13.423 --> 23:15.925
BESIDES, WHEN CONRAD
FINDS OUT ABOUT US,

23:15.925 --> 23:18.498
I'M GONNA BE FINISHED
ON WALL STREET.

23:18.498 --> 23:22.401
I'M GONNA BE PACKING
MY BAGS REGARDLESS.

23:23.973 --> 23:26.606
WELL, THAT'S WHY NO ONE
CAN FIND OUT ABOUT US, DAVID.

23:26.606 --> 23:30.440
I'VE LIVED THAT LIFE BEFORE,
AND I CAN'T LIVE IT AGAIN.

23:30.440 --> 23:31.781
WELL...

23:31.781 --> 23:33.913
WHAT ABOUT LOVE?

23:33.913 --> 23:36.446
CAN YOU LIVE
WITHOUT THAT?

23:37.817 --> 23:40.490
I PROMISE TO TELL YOU
EVERYTHING ONE DAY,

23:40.490 --> 23:42.652
BUT TODAY IS NOT THE DAY.

23:42.652 --> 23:44.754
I NEED YOU TO THINK HARD

23:44.754 --> 23:47.126
ABOUT THAT PERSON
YOU SAW ON THE BEACH.

23:47.126 --> 23:50.500
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THINGS
THAT YOU DON'T REALIZE.

23:50.500 --> 23:52.932
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

23:52.932 --> 23:56.736
YOUR BROTHER'S LIFE
MAY DEPEND ON IT.

23:56.736 --> 23:59.168
(Emily) I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT?

23:59.168 --> 24:01.010
(Nolan) Jack found
the wire transfer receipt

24:01.010 --> 24:02.512
in Amanda's jacket.

24:02.512 --> 24:04.874
DID YOU FIND OUT HOW MUCH
AMANDA TOLD HIM?

24:04.874 --> 24:06.546
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
SHE HAD A LOT OF TIME TO CHAT

24:06.546 --> 24:08.478
BEFORE SHE TOOK OFF.

24:08.478 --> 24:11.781
YOU EVER NOTICE HOW,
WHENEVER YOU WANT HER TO LEAVE,

24:11.781 --> 24:13.483
GIRLFRIEND KEEPS POPPING UP

24:13.483 --> 24:15.525
LIKE THE HOMICIDAL STRIPPER
VERSION OF WHAC-A-MOLE,

24:15.525 --> 24:17.757
BUT WHENEVER YOU NEED
TO FIND HER,

24:17.757 --> 24:19.088
she vanishes?

24:19.088 --> 24:20.930
AND MANAGES TO PULL JACK
EVEN DEEPER INTO TROUBLE.

24:20.930 --> 24:22.461
(knock on door)
 (Brooks) MS. THORNE?

24:23.833 --> 24:25.094
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

24:25.094 --> 24:26.736
(beeps)

24:26.736 --> 24:28.067
MR. BROOKS.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.739
I APOLOGIZE
FOR THE AMBUSH,

24:29.739 --> 24:32.241
BUT I WANTED
TO SPEAK TO YOU ALONE.

24:32.241 --> 24:33.743
TO BE PERFECTLY BLUNT,

24:33.743 --> 24:35.244
THE MORE DIRT I HAVE
ON DANIEL,

24:35.244 --> 24:38.678
THE BETTER PREPARED I'LL BE
WHEN THE FUR STARTS FLYING.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.049
AH.

24:40.049 --> 24:41.551
LOOKING FOR SKELETONS.

24:41.551 --> 24:43.583
SKELETONS, ADDICTIONS,

24:43.583 --> 24:46.015
SECRET RELATIONSHIPS,

24:46.015 --> 24:47.557
PROCLIVITIES.

24:47.557 --> 24:49.719
WOW. YOU ARE BLUNT.

24:49.719 --> 24:52.261
YOUR FIANCE'S FACING
A MURDER CHARGE.

24:52.261 --> 24:54.564
THIS ISN'T THE TIME
FOR SUBTLETY.

24:54.564 --> 24:56.566
VICTORIA IS CONVINCED

24:56.566 --> 24:58.197
AMANDA CLARKE
HAD SOMETHING TO DO

24:58.197 --> 25:00.830
WITH WHAT HAPPENED
ON THAT BEACH.

25:00.830 --> 25:02.501
HAVE YOU HAD ANY RUN-INS
WITH HER?

25:02.501 --> 25:05.174
I JUST MET HER
THIS SUMMER.

25:05.174 --> 25:07.036
SHE USED TO LIVE
IN THIS HOUSE, ACTUALLY.

25:07.036 --> 25:09.108
SHE CAME BY ONCE

25:09.108 --> 25:11.781
LOOKING FOR
CHILDHOOD MEMORIES.

25:11.781 --> 25:13.783
DO YOU BELIEVE
SHE HATES THE GRAYSONS ENOUGH

25:13.783 --> 25:15.945
TO FRAME DANIEL
FOR MURDER?

25:15.945 --> 25:18.618
I THINK
YOU'D HAVE TO FIND HER

25:18.618 --> 25:20.519
AND ASK HER.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.521
ALL I KNOW IS,

25:22.521 --> 25:24.824
SHE'S A VERY TROUBLED GIRL.

25:24.824 --> 25:27.857
I ALREADY HAVE
MY INVESTIGATORS ON IT.

25:27.857 --> 25:30.099
THANK YOU, MS. THORNE.

25:31.561 --> 25:32.562
MR. BROOKS.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.706
SINCE WE'RE BEING CANDID...

25:36.706 --> 25:38.868
I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

25:38.868 --> 25:40.770
ABOUT DANIEL

25:40.770 --> 25:43.112
OR AMANDA?

25:44.173 --> 25:47.176
ABOUT THE GRAYSONS.

25:51.751 --> 25:52.922
I UNDERSTAND DANIEL
GOT INTO A FEW SCRAPES

25:52.922 --> 25:54.083
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS.

25:54.083 --> 25:55.254
LIKE ANYONE HIS AGE,

25:55.254 --> 25:56.886
HE'S HAD A FEW
YOUTHFUL INDISCRETIONS.

25:56.886 --> 25:58.588
AND WHAT ROLE

25:58.588 --> 26:00.660
DID YOU AND CONRAD PLAY
IN THOSE INDISCRETIONS?

26:00.660 --> 26:02.131
I'M NOT SURE
I FOLLOW YOU.

26:02.131 --> 26:05.134
DID YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE
I WOULDN'T FIND OUT

26:05.134 --> 26:06.996
YOU PAID OFF A JUDGE
LAST SUMMER

26:06.996 --> 26:08.868
TO DOWNGRADE DANIEL'S D.U.I.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.700
AND RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT
CHARGES?

26:10.700 --> 26:12.602
WHERE ON EARTH
DID YOU HEAR THIS?

26:12.602 --> 26:14.073
(Emily) I TOLD HIM.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.646
(Victoria) I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ON DANIEL'S SIDE.

26:16.646 --> 26:18.277
OR WAS THAT JUST A RUSE?

26:18.277 --> 26:20.279
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
EMILY IS THE ONLY ONE HERE

26:20.279 --> 26:23.082
WHO SEEMS TO HAVE DANIEL'S
BEST INTERESTS AT HEART.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.685
NO ONE LOVES MY SON
MORE THAN I DO.

26:25.685 --> 26:26.816
WHAT IF THE PROSECUTION

26:26.816 --> 26:29.158
HAD BLINDSIDED ME
WITH THAT MID-TRIAL?

26:29.158 --> 26:30.990
WE WERE VERY DISCREET.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.591
THAT GIRL WAS ALMOST KILLED.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.824
HER BROTHER TOOK A 9-IRON
TO DANIEL'S ASTON MARTIN.

26:34.824 --> 26:36.766
MANY PEOPLE KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID.

26:36.766 --> 26:38.227
EVERYONE'S LOOKING
FOR A MEMBER

26:38.227 --> 26:39.799
OF THE 1% TO SMACK DOWN,

26:39.799 --> 26:42.902
AND DANIEL IS TAILOR-MADE
TO TAKE THAT FALL.

26:42.902 --> 26:44.603
SO UNLESS YOU'RE READY
TO LEVEL WITH ME,

26:44.603 --> 26:46.105
I MIGHT AS WELL BE UP
AT SHINNECOCK HILLS

26:46.105 --> 26:48.207
PRACTICING MY BACKSWING.

26:50.039 --> 26:53.212
OF COURSE, MR. BROOKS.

26:53.212 --> 26:55.384
FROM HERE ON OUT, YOU'LL HAVE

26:55.384 --> 26:57.687
COMPLETE AND UTTER CANDOR
FROM BOTH OF US.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.791
DO YOU HAVE ANY LEADS
ON AMANDA CLARKE?

27:01.791 --> 27:03.352
STILL WORKING ON IT.

27:03.352 --> 27:05.324
DID YOU KNOW THAT SHE DATED
THAT YOUNG MAN

27:05.324 --> 27:07.626
WHO RUNS THE STOWAWAY TAVERN
IN MONTAUK?

27:07.626 --> 27:09.328
HIS NAME IS JACK PORTER.

27:09.328 --> 27:10.830
I'LL PAY HIM A VISIT.

27:10.830 --> 27:13.062
BUT MY MORE IMMEDIATE CONCERN

27:13.062 --> 27:14.734
IS THE SECURITY TAPES
FROM THE PARTY.

27:14.734 --> 27:15.865
WHAT NOW?

27:15.865 --> 27:18.738
APPARENTLY,
THEY WERE TAMPERED WITH.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.339
(Brooks)
KEPT ON A 3-MINUTE LOOP

27:20.339 --> 27:21.911
FOR THE BULK
OF THE EVENING.

27:21.911 --> 27:25.214
(applause)

27:25.214 --> 27:26.946
(Conrad) AND HOW DOES THAT
IMPACT US?

27:26.946 --> 27:28.848
THE PROSECUTION
WILL MAKE IT LOOK LIKE

27:28.848 --> 27:32.922
DANIEL ENGINEERED IT SO NO ONE
WOULD SEE HIM KILL TYLER.

27:34.083 --> 27:36.255
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN WORKING FOR TAKEDA?

27:36.255 --> 27:37.827
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

27:37.827 --> 27:39.128
I KNOW YOU DISABLED
THE SECURITY CAMERAS

27:39.128 --> 27:40.389
AT THE PARTY.

27:40.389 --> 27:42.391
IT'S GOT TAKEDA'S STAMP
ALL OVER IT.

27:42.391 --> 27:44.263
DO I REALLY NEED
TO KICK YOUR ASS AGAIN?

27:44.263 --> 27:46.265
HOW DID HE RECRUIT YOU?

27:46.265 --> 27:47.737
OKAY.

27:47.737 --> 27:49.739
HE COZIED UP TO ME
AT THE INVESTORS' SHINDIG

27:49.739 --> 27:51.340
EARLIER THIS SUMMER.

27:51.340 --> 27:53.342
HE WANTED ME
TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU.

27:53.342 --> 27:55.104
(sighs)
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

27:55.104 --> 27:56.776
BECAUSE HE TOLD ME NOT TO,

27:56.776 --> 27:59.048
AND HE CAN BE
VERY CONVINCING.

28:00.710 --> 28:02.952
I'M SORRY, EMS.

28:02.952 --> 28:05.184
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S MY FAULT.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.016
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE BROUGHT YOU
SO DEEP INTO THIS.

28:07.016 --> 28:08.888
WELL, IT'S A LITTLE LATE
TO PUT THAT GENIE

28:08.888 --> 28:10.019
BACK IN THE INFINITY BOX.

28:10.019 --> 28:11.721
ANYWAY, WE HAVE
MORE PRESSING PROBLEMS

28:11.721 --> 28:13.793
THAN YOUR LOYALTY ISSUES.

28:13.793 --> 28:15.825
THE GRAYSONS ARE ON A MISSION
TO FIND AMANDA.

28:15.825 --> 28:17.827
UNTIL THEY DO, THEY'RE GONNA BE
LOOKING FOR A FALL GUY

28:17.827 --> 28:19.298
CLOSER TO HOME.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.971
(sighs) JACK.

28:21.971 --> 28:23.302
(reporters shouting all at once,
camera shutters clicking)

28:23.302 --> 28:24.834
MS. DAVENPORT, HOW ARE
THE GRAYSONS HOLDING UP

28:24.834 --> 28:26.005
DURING THIS
VERY DIFFICULT TIME?

28:26.005 --> 28:27.937
THEY'RE DEVASTATED.

28:27.937 --> 28:31.811
DANIEL GRAYSON'S ARREST
IS A TERRIBLE INJUSTICE.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.312
THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW

28:33.312 --> 28:35.885
THAT NOT ONLY DID DANIEL
NOT COMMIT THE CRIME,

28:35.885 --> 28:37.887
BUT THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER
PERSON ON THE BEACH THAT NIGHT

28:37.887 --> 28:39.889
WHO HAD BOTH THE MOTIVE
AND THE MEANS

28:39.889 --> 28:42.922
TO MURDER TYLER BARROL
AND FRAME DANIEL FOR THE CRIME.

28:42.922 --> 28:46.355
THE GRAYSON FAMILY ARE OFFERING
A $100,000 REWARD

28:46.355 --> 28:48.497
FOR ANY INFORMATION
LEADING TO THE CONVICTION

28:48.497 --> 28:50.059
OF THE KILLER.

28:50.059 --> 28:51.230
(reporters shout indistinctly)

29:13.152 --> 29:14.423
CHARLOTTE.

29:14.423 --> 29:16.285
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

29:16.285 --> 29:19.889
THIS IS THE PRETTIEST SPOT
ON THE BEACH.

29:19.889 --> 29:23.032
IT'S SO PEACEFUL.

29:23.032 --> 29:25.434
YEAH, I REALLY LUCKED OUT.

29:27.897 --> 29:30.539
HARD TO BELIEVE I GREW UP
WITH A SISTER RIGHT NEXT DOOR

29:30.539 --> 29:33.242
AND I NEVER HAD ANY IDEA.

29:34.874 --> 29:38.808
DO YOU THINK SHE KNEW
THE TRUTH THIS WHOLE SUMMER?

29:38.808 --> 29:42.051
MY MOTHER THINKS SHE DID.

29:42.051 --> 29:44.053
THERE'S JUST SO MUCH
I WANT TO ASK HER

29:44.053 --> 29:47.256
ABOUT HER LIFE,
HER FATHER...

29:47.256 --> 29:49.388
OUR FATHER.

29:49.388 --> 29:53.462
BUT CHANCES ARE,
THAT WON'T HAPPEN NOW.

29:57.266 --> 30:00.329
IS THAT WHY YOU'VE BEEN
TAKING THOSE PILLS?

30:06.535 --> 30:09.038
YOU KNOW...

30:09.038 --> 30:12.381
JACK AND AMANDA
CAME OVER ONE DAY AND...

30:12.381 --> 30:16.315
THEY TOLD ME THAT YOUR FATHER
BUILT THIS SWING.

30:16.315 --> 30:19.388
HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ALL BAD.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.462
(sighs)

30:38.267 --> 30:40.069
HEY, JACK,
YOU GOT A SEC?

30:40.069 --> 30:43.112
YEAH. WHAT'S UP?

30:44.413 --> 30:46.045
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN I WAS 9,

30:46.045 --> 30:48.547
AND ME AND JIMMY SMITHSON WERE
PLAYING FRISBEE IN THE BAR,

30:48.547 --> 30:51.050
AND I BROKE
DAD'S FAVORITE BEER SIGN?

30:51.050 --> 30:53.352
(chuckles) THE NEON ONE
WITH THE CLOCK?

30:53.352 --> 30:55.955
MM-HMM. YEAH, AND DAD
WENT BALLISTIC.

30:55.955 --> 30:59.388
YOU KNOW, I-I'D NEVER SEEN
SOMEBODY ACTUALLY TURN PURPLE.

30:59.388 --> 31:01.590
SO I RAN UP TO MY ROOM,
STARTED PACKING A BAG,

31:01.590 --> 31:04.633
YOU KNOW, FIGURING
I WAS GONNA RUN AWAY.

31:04.633 --> 31:08.037
AND YOU TOLD HIM
YOU DID IT,

31:08.037 --> 31:09.338
EVEN THOUGH HE GROUNDED YOU

31:09.338 --> 31:11.340
AND WOULDN'T LET YOU GO
ON THAT CAMPING TRIP

31:11.340 --> 31:13.042
TO THE ADIRONDACKS.

31:17.006 --> 31:18.177
DEC--

31:18.177 --> 31:20.479
NO, YOU ARE THE MOST
STAND-UP GUY I KNOW.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.151
I'VE SEEN YOU TAKE THE HEAT
FOR OTHER PEOPLE

31:22.151 --> 31:23.652
OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

31:23.652 --> 31:25.154
BUT YOU GOT A LOT MORE
TO LOSE HERE

31:25.154 --> 31:28.217
THAN A COUPLE OF DAYS
IN THE MOUNTAINS.

31:28.217 --> 31:31.390
AND I-I DON'T CARE WHO YOU'RE
PROTECTING OR WHY.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.493
BUT AS OF NOW, I'M GONNA
START PROTECTING YOU.

31:51.941 --> 31:53.983
(people speaking indistinctly)

31:53.983 --> 31:55.284
(Brooks) SINGLE MALT.

31:55.284 --> 31:56.986
NEAT.

31:56.986 --> 31:58.287
COMING UP.

31:58.287 --> 32:01.420
WHERE'S THAT PRETTY GIRL
WHO TENDS BAR?

32:01.420 --> 32:03.592
AMANDA, IS IT?

32:03.592 --> 32:05.124
OUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL.

32:05.124 --> 32:07.156
WHEN THE SUMMER ENDS,
PEOPLE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT GIG.

32:07.156 --> 32:09.028
HAPPENS EVERY YEAR.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.659
YOU TWO
WERE DATING, RIGHT?

32:12.101 --> 32:14.203
YOU ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

32:14.203 --> 32:15.965
BENJAMIN BROOKS.

32:15.965 --> 32:17.936
I REPRESENT DANIEL GRAYSON.

32:17.936 --> 32:21.540
(people speaking indistinctly)

32:21.540 --> 32:23.172
I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION
FOR YOU.

32:23.172 --> 32:25.074
WHERE WERE YOU
SATURDAY NIGHT?

32:25.074 --> 32:27.416
I WAS STARTING
TO SAIL TO HAITI.

32:27.416 --> 32:29.618
I WAS GETTING READY TO HELP
WITH THE REBUILDING THERE.

32:29.618 --> 32:32.481
AREN'T YOU THE ALTRUIST?
WHAT STOPPED YOU?

32:32.481 --> 32:34.053
ENGINE TROUBLE.

32:34.053 --> 32:35.554
THAT'S A SHAME.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.486
PRETTY SOON, FALL WILL BE HERE.
IT'LL BE TOO ROUGH A TRIP.

32:37.486 --> 32:40.029
SHOULD'VE LEFT
WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE.

32:44.033 --> 32:45.394
LET ME KNOW IF YOU HEAR
FROM AMANDA.

32:48.637 --> 32:51.400
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

32:51.400 --> 32:54.003
OH, I CAN HAVE YOUR BOAT
FIXED AND READY TO GO

32:54.003 --> 32:55.304
BY NIGHTFALL.

32:55.304 --> 32:58.077
RUNNING AWAY IS NOT GONNA
SOLVE ANYTHING.

32:58.077 --> 33:00.179
AND I GOTTA FIND AMANDA
BEFORE THE GRAYSONS DO.

33:00.179 --> 33:01.980
AND HOW ARE YOU
GONNA DO THAT?

33:03.382 --> 33:04.753
I DON'T KNOW YET.

33:14.093 --> 33:17.326
(Ashley) DOES IT MATTER TO YOU
IF YOUR CLIENTS ARE GUILTY?

33:17.326 --> 33:19.328
I NEVER ASK.

33:19.328 --> 33:20.599
CYNICAL.

33:20.599 --> 33:22.271
THE LAST THING I NEED

33:22.271 --> 33:24.273
IS TO HAVE
MY JUDGMENT CLOUDED.

33:24.273 --> 33:26.275
AND IN 20 YEARS,
I HAVEN'T LOST A CASE,

33:26.275 --> 33:28.207
SO IF AIN'T BROKE...

33:29.608 --> 33:32.681
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE
ON ALL THIS?

33:35.514 --> 33:37.686
I THINK DANIEL SHOT TYLER.

33:37.686 --> 33:39.788
AND I THINK HE'S GONNA
GET AWAY WITH IT.

33:39.788 --> 33:43.192
AND YET YOU CONTINUE
TO WORK FOR THE GRAYSONS.

33:44.293 --> 33:46.455
I COME FROM A TOWN
CALLED CROYDON,

33:46.455 --> 33:48.227
JUST OUTSIDE OF LONDON.

33:48.227 --> 33:50.499
POPULATION--NO ONE CARES
AND DROPPING.

33:50.499 --> 33:52.201
I WANT MORE OUT OF LIFE

33:52.201 --> 33:53.502
THAN PLANNING PARTIES
AND MAKING SURE

33:53.502 --> 33:55.264
OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES
RUN SMOOTHLY,

33:55.264 --> 33:57.136
BUT FOR NOW...

33:57.136 --> 33:58.537
IT'S MY JOB.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.269
THE CAMERA SURE LOVES YOU.

34:00.269 --> 34:02.471
YOU PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT,

34:02.471 --> 34:06.175
YOU CAN PARLAY DANIEL'S TRIAL
INTO A WHOLE NEW CAREER.

34:06.175 --> 34:08.117
BUT THEN...

34:08.117 --> 34:10.248
I THINK
YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT.

34:17.356 --> 34:18.527
(footsteps approach)

34:18.527 --> 34:20.629
LOOKS LIKE
YOU COULD USE SOME COMPANY.

34:20.629 --> 34:23.262
HMM.

34:23.262 --> 34:24.233
TWO MONTHS AGO,

34:24.233 --> 34:25.734
WE WERE BEING HERALDED
IN "THE TIMES."

34:25.734 --> 34:27.266
AS A GOLDEN COUPLE,

34:27.266 --> 34:29.168
AND NOW LOOK AT US.

34:29.168 --> 34:32.201
ONE CHILD ARRESTED
FOR MURDER,

34:32.201 --> 34:35.804
AND THE OTHER CAN'T LOOK AT US
WITHOUT CONTEMPT,

34:35.804 --> 34:38.507
DIVORCED BUT LIVING UNDER
THE SAME ROOF.

34:38.507 --> 34:40.549
AT LEAST IT'S
A 20,000-SQUARE-FOOT ROOF.

34:40.549 --> 34:43.181
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'LL BE
TRIPPING OVER EACH OTHER.

34:43.181 --> 34:45.583
24,000.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.085
(laughing)

34:47.085 --> 34:49.158
(laughing)

34:49.158 --> 34:50.719
(continues laughing)

34:50.719 --> 34:53.322
OH. HOW THE HELL
DID WE GET HERE?

34:53.322 --> 34:56.165
MM. I DON'T KNOW.

34:56.165 --> 34:58.327
I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED
THE DOMINO EFFECT.

34:58.327 --> 34:59.828
YOU KNOW,
ONE MOVE BEGETS ANOTHER,

34:59.828 --> 35:01.330
AND THEN
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT...

35:01.330 --> 35:03.132
THEY ALL FALL DOWN.

35:07.436 --> 35:09.508
I'M WORRIED.

35:12.681 --> 35:16.345
JAIL IS NO PLACE
FOR A BOY LIKE DANIEL.

35:16.345 --> 35:18.187
(woman) THERE IS A PERCEPTION

35:18.187 --> 35:19.648
IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD

35:19.648 --> 35:23.252
THAT POWER AND MONEY
EXERT UNDUE INFLUENCE.

35:23.252 --> 35:24.693
I WANT IT CLEAR--

35:24.693 --> 35:26.325
IN MY COURTROOM,

35:26.325 --> 35:28.197
JUSTICE HAS NO PRICE TAG.

35:28.197 --> 35:30.629
I HAVE CAREFULLY EXAMINED

35:30.629 --> 35:32.701
THE WEALTH
OF FORENSIC EVIDENCE

35:32.701 --> 35:35.704
LINKING DANIEL GRAYSON
TO THE CRIME SCENE

35:35.704 --> 35:39.368
AND TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION
THE GRAYSON FAMILY'S

35:39.368 --> 35:41.410
UNLIMITED RESOURCES

35:41.410 --> 35:44.313
AS WELL AS PRIVATE PLANES.

35:44.313 --> 35:47.376
GIVEN THE SERIOUS NATURE
OF THIS CRIME,

35:47.376 --> 35:49.248
I HEREBY DENY BAIL...

35:49.248 --> 35:50.449
OH , MY GOD

35:50.449 --> 35:51.780
FOR DANIEL GRAYSON...

35:51.780 --> 35:52.921
(gallery murmuring)

35:52.921 --> 35:54.783
AND ORDER HIM TO BE REMANDED

35:54.783 --> 35:56.355
TO THE MAXIMUM SECURITY

35:56.355 --> 35:58.627
CORRECTIONAL FACILITY
ON RIKERS ISLAND

35:58.627 --> 36:00.329
WHILE HE AWAITS TRIAL.
 NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

36:00.329 --> 36:01.890
(Daniel) BEN--
 DANIEL. DANIEL.

36:01.890 --> 36:03.432
(camera shutters clicking)

36:03.432 --> 36:04.763
BAILIFF, WOULD YOU PLEASE...
 (bangs gavel)

36:04.763 --> 36:06.295
REMOVE THE DEFENDANT?

36:06.295 --> 36:07.596
(clicking continues)

36:07.596 --> 36:09.538
(speaks indistinctly)
 YOU GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

36:09.538 --> 36:11.540
(clicking continues)

36:11.540 --> 36:15.374
(people speaking indistinctly)

36:22.381 --> 36:23.552
DO THE GRAYSONS SEE
THE JUDGE'S RULING

36:23.552 --> 36:24.883
AS A HUGE DEFEAT?

36:24.883 --> 36:26.385
THE GRAYSON FAMILY
HAVE THE GREATEST RESPECT

36:26.385 --> 36:28.457
FOR THE COURT'S DECISION
REGARDING DANIEL'S BAIL.

36:28.457 --> 36:31.220
BUT THEY DO VIEW THIS
AS A MINOR SETBACK,

36:31.220 --> 36:33.222
AND ONE THEY'RE SURE
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WILL REMEDY

36:33.222 --> 36:34.863
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

36:34.863 --> 36:36.595
I'D ALSO LIKE--

36:36.595 --> 36:38.627
(indistinct conversations)

36:38.627 --> 36:42.331
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE,
ARE YOU?

36:42.331 --> 36:43.602
NO, DECLAN NEEDS ME.

36:43.602 --> 36:47.406
OH, KUDOS
FOR THE FAMILY VALUES.

36:47.406 --> 36:50.709
BUT YOU'RE MAKING
A COLOSSAL MISTAKE.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.511
(pen clatters)

36:52.511 --> 36:54.883
DOES THIS MEAN
YOU DON'T WANT A DRINK?

36:54.883 --> 36:57.946
(indistinct conversations
continue)

36:57.946 --> 36:59.718
MAKE IT A DOUBLE.

36:59.718 --> 37:03.622
IT'S GONNA BE
A LONG FALL.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.757
(cash register dings)

37:11.930 --> 37:13.462
(cell phone clicks and beeps)

37:13.462 --> 37:14.763
(indistinct conversations
continue)

37:14.763 --> 37:15.934
(beep)

37:15.934 --> 37:17.306
(phone rings)

37:17.306 --> 37:19.007
(clears throat)

37:19.007 --> 37:20.869
(man) Nolcorp,
I.T. department,

37:20.869 --> 37:22.411
HEY, IT'S NOLAN.

37:22.411 --> 37:24.643
THOSE PHOTOS WE PULLED DOWN
FOR THE GRAYSONS,

37:24.643 --> 37:27.916
I NEED YOU TO FIND OUT
WHERE THEY ORIGINATED.

37:36.385 --> 37:40.729
ADVERSITY CREATES
UNEXPECTED ALLIANCES...

37:43.832 --> 37:45.394
BUT TREATIES OF THIS NATURE

37:45.394 --> 37:48.937
SELDOM FORM
WITH AN EQUALITY OF POWER.

37:53.502 --> 37:57.506
(indistinct conversations)

37:57.506 --> 38:00.409
WELL, HERE SHE IS--

38:00.409 --> 38:02.010
THE MEDIA'S NEW IT GIRL.

38:02.010 --> 38:03.512
MM. IT'S QUITE AN UPGRADE

38:03.512 --> 38:05.554
FROM THE QUEEN'S
FAVORITE WORKER BEE.

38:05.554 --> 38:07.886
I TAKE IT YOU DIDN'T SUMMON ME
HERE FOR AN AUTOGRAPH.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.918
I'M ALL FOR
A METEORIC RISE, ASH,

38:09.918 --> 38:12.391
BUT, UH, I FOLLOWED A HUNCH,

38:12.391 --> 38:14.963
AND SOURCED THE SCANDAL PICS

38:14.963 --> 38:17.025
THAT ARE BLOWING UP
THE INTERNET.

38:17.025 --> 38:21.930
AND GUESS WHERE
THE TRAIL ENDS.

38:21.930 --> 38:24.533
WHO ELSE KNOWS?

38:24.533 --> 38:27.035
JUST US...

38:27.035 --> 38:29.708
FOR NOW.

38:29.708 --> 38:33.912
LOYALTIES FORGED
IN APPREHENSION AND MISTRUST...

38:35.414 --> 38:38.587
ARE TENUOUS AT BEST...

38:44.623 --> 38:46.495
EASILY BROKEN WHEN HELD UP

38:46.495 --> 38:51.400
TO THE UNFORGIVING LIGHT
OF THE TRUTH.

38:51.400 --> 38:52.701
(cell door clatters)

38:52.701 --> 38:54.703
BUT IN THE DARKNESS
OF OUR MOST DESPERATE HOURS...

38:54.703 --> 38:56.505
(man shouts indistinctly)

38:56.505 --> 38:58.607
IT'S OFTEN THESE LOYALTIES
THAT LEND US THE STRENGTH

38:58.607 --> 39:01.339
TO DO WHAT WE KNOW
MUST BE DONE.

39:05.644 --> 39:08.647
(panting)

39:10.479 --> 39:11.650
(grunts)

39:11.650 --> 39:14.122
YOU SHOULD'VE HEEDED
MY WARNING.

39:14.122 --> 39:16.625
(pants) WHAT DID YOU DO?

39:16.625 --> 39:19.958
(grunting)

39:22.531 --> 39:23.692
(grunts and pants)

39:23.692 --> 39:25.764
(speaks Japanese)

39:25.764 --> 39:26.965
(exhales)

39:26.965 --> 39:29.067
WHAT HAPPENED ON THE BEACH?

39:29.067 --> 39:30.569
(grunts)

39:30.569 --> 39:33.542
THE BOY
WAS GOING TO EXPOSE YOU.

39:33.542 --> 39:36.505
(panting)

39:36.505 --> 39:39.077
(Daniel) YOU WON'T
GET AWAY WITH THIS, TYLER.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.579
SURE I WILL,

39:40.579 --> 39:43.552
BUT EMILY WON'T.

39:45.013 --> 39:47.986
(both grunting)

39:47.986 --> 39:49.518
(Tyler) AH!

39:49.518 --> 39:50.959
NO!

39:52.891 --> 39:54.723
AH!

39:54.723 --> 39:55.894
(clicks gun)

39:55.894 --> 39:57.065
STAY BACK!

39:57.065 --> 39:59.428
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CALL
EMILY FIRST.

39:59.428 --> 40:02.631
ASK HER PERMISSION
TO PULL THE TRIGGER.

40:02.631 --> 40:04.673
SHE'S A WOLF
IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING, YOU IDIOT.

40:04.673 --> 40:05.634
(fireworks whistling
and popping)

40:05.634 --> 40:07.135
AND YOU'RE JUST A HELPLESS
LITTLE LAMB

40:07.135 --> 40:09.538
HEADED FOR THE SLAUGHTER.

40:09.538 --> 40:10.839
AAH!

40:10.839 --> 40:11.980
(groans)

40:11.980 --> 40:14.412
(grunts)

40:14.412 --> 40:15.684
(thump)

40:18.116 --> 40:19.748
(Daniel thuds)

40:21.550 --> 40:22.851
PLEASE.

40:22.851 --> 40:24.553
HELP ME. (grunts)

40:27.856 --> 40:29.598
NO!

40:29.598 --> 40:31.560
(fireworks whistle)

40:43.612 --> 40:44.973
(Takeda)
BUT THERE WERE OTHERS.

40:44.973 --> 40:46.144
(panting)

40:46.144 --> 40:48.617
THE GIRL YOU CALL AMANDA.

40:48.617 --> 40:51.680
SHE HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF.

40:51.680 --> 40:52.821
AMANDA!

40:52.821 --> 40:54.853
AND THEN...

40:54.853 --> 40:57.125
JACK. (panting)

40:57.125 --> 41:00.729
THE OTHER BOY
YOU HAVE FEELINGS FOR.

41:00.729 --> 41:02.090
(grunts)

41:02.090 --> 41:03.892
(pants)

41:03.892 --> 41:06.134
YOU CANNOT SAVE THEM BOTH.

41:06.134 --> 41:07.596
(photo clatters)

41:07.596 --> 41:10.599
(panting)

41:12.501 --> 41:17.045
(Emily) A CONFLICTED HEART
FEEDS ON DOUBT AND CONFUSION.

41:17.045 --> 41:18.677
(continues panting)

41:18.677 --> 41:21.650
IT WILL MAKE YOU QUESTION
YOUR PATH...

41:21.650 --> 41:23.251
YOUR TACTICS...

41:23.251 --> 41:25.884
YOUR MOTIVES.

41:25.884 --> 41:29.758
(continues panting)

41:31.259 --> 41:34.492
AAH!

41:34.492 --> 41:38.066
WHEN YOU STARE AHEAD
AND DARKNESS IS ALL YOU SEE,

41:38.066 --> 41:40.268
ONLY REASON AND DETERMINATION

41:40.268 --> 41:43.672
CAN YOU PULL YOU BACK
FROM THE ABYSS.

41:43.672 --> 41:45.534
(pants)
