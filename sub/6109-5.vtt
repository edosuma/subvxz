02:54.259 --> 02:56.469
What happened yesterday
with that guy,

it was a terrible thing, and...

02:58.721 --> 03:01.099
If I could
take it all back, I...

03:01.266 --> 03:04.060
But what happened
before the shooting with us,

03:04.227 --> 03:06.187
that was maybe
the most beautiful thing,

03:06.354 --> 03:08.064
at least for me.

03:08.231 --> 03:10.108
All the gunfire in the world
can't change that.

03:11.526 --> 03:13.570
I'll say a prayer for the guy.

- Are the two related?
- You got to ask the question.

the same thing

05:07.934 --> 05:09.560

these autopsy results

looking for any connection
to the Spivak genome.

And?

05:13.272 --> 05:15.024
So far, nothing,

05:15.191 --> 05:17.193
but now that this evidence
has surfaced linking Spivak

05:17.360 --> 05:19.529
to genetic research
the Nazis were doing...

05:19.696 --> 05:22.281
- What evidence?
- Well, uh...

05:22.448 --> 05:24.742
What I meant to say
is I should, or, rather, I will,

05:24.909 --> 05:27.203
do some investigating,
see if there's...

05:27.370 --> 05:29.956
..evidence that Spivak WAS aware

of the research the...
Nazis were doing.

31:12.539 --> 31:15.333
So he told me he was going
to the next village

31:15.500 --> 31:17.335
to steal a plough horse.

31:18.419 --> 31:22.048
That was...
the last I saw of him.

31:24.008 --> 31:26.219
You must have been heartbroken.

31:27.387 --> 31:29.639
I cried and cried.

31:30.765 --> 31:32.225
I loved him.

31:33.393 --> 31:34.894
I missed him.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.604
Hated him.

31:36.771 --> 31:38.690
Loved him again.

31:40.441 --> 31:42.944
And by the time I delivered,
I was just...

31:43.111 --> 31:44.904
..angry.

31:46.322 --> 31:47.782
I mean, I'm grateful to him,
though.

31:47.949 --> 31:49.951
He taught me a valuable lesson.

31:50.118 --> 31:52.245
Men leave.

31:52.412 --> 31:54.789
- Not all men.
- All men.

31:54.956 --> 31:56.749
It's what they do.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.459
I mean, even your Tod.

31:58.626 --> 32:01.629
Maybe not at the time or
in the manner of his choosing,

32:01.796 --> 32:04.090
but...here you are alone.

32:06.384 --> 32:08.511
I know you have
your faith or whatever

32:08.678 --> 32:10.430
and you think
he's somewhere...

32:10.597 --> 32:13.182
..perfect, whole and...

32:13.349 --> 32:15.018
Complete. Yeah.

32:15.184 --> 32:16.603
But he's not here.

32:16.769 --> 32:19.230
But he is, in here.

32:19.397 --> 32:21.566
Just because I can't see him...

32:21.733 --> 32:24.235
Or smell him or touch him
or fuck him.

32:27.030 --> 32:29.449
All you can do is be angry.

32:29.616 --> 32:32.035
Angry, you can do alone.

32:40.335 --> 32:42.587
Scrounged up some...bronzing

32:42.754 --> 32:45.590

sculpting fixative powder

32:45.757 --> 32:47.342

32:47.508 --> 32:51.220
Can I ask you something
that stays here?

32:51.387 --> 32:53.264
First date?

32:53.431 --> 32:56.392
Pretty obvious, I guess.

32:56.559 --> 32:58.186
Don't trip.

32:58.353 --> 33:00.229
It's like going somewhere
by yourself,

33:00.396 --> 33:02.357
only with another person
hanging around.

33:06.861 --> 33:10.239
You know, I've graf-bombed faces
on plenty of buildings.

33:10.406 --> 33:12.950
If you want,
I can see what I can do.

33:13.117 --> 33:14.869
Thanks.

33:15.036 --> 33:16.829
You'd be at it for days.

33:16.996 --> 33:19.332
It would take
a lot of spackle, modelling clay

33:19.499 --> 33:22.126
and a hot glue gun
to renovate this facade.

33:22.293 --> 33:25.880
If Aitor wants to take me
to the movies or...whatever,

33:26.047 --> 33:28.883
it's gonna have to be as is.

33:29.050 --> 33:32.553
They pulled you out of me, and
then...and they took you away.

33:32.720 --> 33:36.099
They wouldn't let me hold you
or...or...or even look at you.

33:36.265 --> 33:40.436
I was...punished just for asking
where you'd been sent.

33:42.063 --> 33:44.232
I would lie awake at night
wondering...

33:44.399 --> 33:47.610
..where you were,
what...your life was like.

33:49.404 --> 33:51.698
Did you ever
come looking for me?

33:54.033 --> 33:56.369
Records being
the way they were in those days,

33:56.536 --> 33:58.413
there was no way
I could find you.

34:01.249 --> 34:04.127
But did you ever look for me?

34:06.337 --> 34:08.797
I...I always thought about you
on your birthday.

34:08.965 --> 34:11.134
And on Christmas Day.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.136
You had money.

34:13.302 --> 34:16.556
Did you hire someone
to track me down?

34:19.350 --> 34:21.601
It's not a hard question.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.902
No.

34:34.031 --> 34:37.118
And you sh...you should be
thankful for that.

34:39.954 --> 34:42.290
I'm not the world's best mom.

34:42.456 --> 34:44.917
I have two other children
who will tell you as much.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.670
We're not very close.

34:47.837 --> 34:51.215
And I...I take responsibility
for that.

34:53.384 --> 34:55.636
But I...I've learned
from my mistakes, and I...

34:55.803 --> 34:58.639
..I want things
to be different with us.

35:00.057 --> 35:01.434
We've been honest
with each other.

35:01.601 --> 35:03.519
We're different people

35:03.686 --> 35:05.605

differently.

35:06.898 --> 35:09.358

35:11.027 --> 35:13.988
past the circumstances
that separated us.

35:17.533 --> 35:20.745
And I want us to find the things
that draw us closer together.

35:25.249 --> 35:27.168
Will you do that with me?

35:29.003 --> 35:30.296
Yes.

46:14.857 --> 46:16.650
I understand.

46:18.068 --> 46:19.945
Do I make you nervous?

46:20.112 --> 46:21.572
No.

46:21.738 --> 46:23.699
But there is
the whole issue of...

46:23.866 --> 46:27.870
..comportment regarding a...
first kiss situation

46:28.036 --> 46:32.458
presenting itself, should we...
continue down this path,

46:32.624 --> 46:34.418
which...

46:34.585 --> 46:36.003
..objectively speaking,

46:36.170 --> 46:38.630
is completely terrifying.

46:38.797 --> 46:41.550
First...kiss?

46:41.717 --> 46:44.845
See? I already ruined it.

46:46.597 --> 46:48.223
Forget I said anything.

46:48.390 --> 46:51.268
You want to kiss me?

46:52.895 --> 46:54.855
Not if you don't want me to.

46:56.231 --> 46:58.066
See, this is where I struggle,

46:58.233 --> 47:01.111
in that grey zone
of getting close to someone,

47:01.278 --> 47:03.989
knowing or not knowing
when it's appropriate

47:04.156 --> 47:06.200
or not appropriate,
as the case may...

47:06.366 --> 47:09.328
I'd be fine with it...I think.

47:09.495 --> 47:10.787
Though maybe
it would be better

47:10.954 --> 47:13.373
if we just called it
our second kiss.

47:15.375 --> 47:18.378
<i>(MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY
IN MOVIE)</i>

47:20.088 --> 47:22.299
WOMAN: <i>That's your job?
You're a field inspector.</i>

47:22.466 --> 47:25.177
MAN: <i>Well, maybe I should
find me some other kind of work.</i>

47:26.345 --> 47:28.514
<i>Because it ain't like
the old days.</i>

47:28.680 --> 47:32.434
<i>It's bad, dangerous and ugly
down there, Kelly.</i>

47:32.601 --> 47:35.229
<i>Would you believe the other day,
I saw a rat this big?</i>

47:35.395 --> 47:37.481
<i>- Are you through?
- No, I mean it!</i>

47:37.648 --> 47:39.650
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

47:41.777 --> 47:44.530
I was worried when I didn't
hear back, but, um...

47:46.240 --> 47:48.158
- Are you OK?
- I'm good.

47:48.325 --> 47:50.452
You've hurt yourself.

47:50.619 --> 47:52.788
- Here, let me see.
- Really. I'm fine.

47:52.955 --> 47:56.833
You know what? You need
a stiff drink and a good meal.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.627
There's this little bistro
in Sewickley

47:58.794 --> 48:00.087
I've been meaning to try.

48:00.254 --> 48:01.338
I really can't.

48:03.549 --> 48:06.009
Well, I suppose we could
stay here and order pizza

48:06.176 --> 48:07.678
like a couple of teenagers.

48:07.844 --> 48:09.513
Roman fired me.

48:09.680 --> 48:12.766
That pissy little prick.

48:12.933 --> 48:16.562
No, trust me. Not working
for your son is a good thing.

48:16.728 --> 48:18.397
I've been doing some digging,
and...

48:18.564 --> 48:21.316
..the stuff I'm coming up with
is about as bad as it gets.

48:21.483 --> 48:23.360
Forget about Roman.

48:24.361 --> 48:26.863
I want to tell you all about
my afternoon with Annie.

48:27.030 --> 48:30.534
I...I keep a fishing boat
down in the Florida Keys.

48:30.701 --> 48:33.787
I think I should go spend
some quality time on board,

48:33.954 --> 48:36.206
far, far away from here.

48:36.373 --> 48:38.166
What are you saying?

48:38.333 --> 48:40.794
If I leave now,
ahead of rush hour,

48:40.961 --> 48:43.505
I can...get there
by sunset tomorrow.

48:45.716 --> 48:47.009
What about Shelley?

48:47.175 --> 48:49.261
I got a buddy of mine
checking in on that.

48:50.721 --> 48:53.056
That guy she's with, turns out,
has some priors.

48:53.223 --> 48:54.850
So that's all in FedEx.

48:55.017 --> 48:58.061
You need to help me
find my granddaughter.

48:58.228 --> 49:00.522
I hate to say it,
but you know as well as anyone,

49:00.689 --> 49:02.399
I'm turning up nothing
on that.

49:02.566 --> 49:04.985
And Roman - I mean,
you know what he's capable of.

49:05.152 --> 49:08.030
Imagine how I feel.
You can't go.

49:08.196 --> 49:10.866
My car is packed.
I'm checked out of my place.

49:16.204 --> 49:17.205
And us?

49:19.124 --> 49:21.835
Just really...
beginning to know one another.

49:24.880 --> 49:28.133
For whatever reason,
you and I really seem to click.

49:29.217 --> 49:32.721
You seem to understand me.
Most men...don't.

49:32.888 --> 49:35.057
I've enjoyed
working with you too.

49:35.223 --> 49:38.018
And we'll definitely
stay in touch.

49:38.185 --> 49:41.104
You should plan a trip.
Get you out on the boat.

49:41.271 --> 49:43.815
Gulf Stream's
just a couple miles offshore.

49:43.982 --> 49:46.735
There's a marlin out there with
your name on it. No question.

49:50.238 --> 49:52.240
You have to stay
in Hemlock Grove.

49:52.407 --> 49:55.535
I...I need you here with me.

49:57.037 --> 49:58.538
Come here.

50:07.881 --> 50:09.424
Don't leave.

50:09.591 --> 50:11.593
We'll see each other soon.

50:15.681 --> 50:18.850
What do I have to do
to make you stay?

50:19.976 --> 50:22.813
AITOR: Most people think
the world's gonna end

50:22.979 --> 50:24.398
in a ball of fire

50:24.564 --> 50:27.484
or a blinding flash and a...

50:27.651 --> 50:30.112
..giant mushroom cloud.

50:31.947 --> 50:35.158
Personally, I think Armageddon's
happening all around us,

50:35.325 --> 50:37.703
in slow motion.

50:40.080 --> 50:44.376
"This is the way the world ends,
not with a bang but a whimper"?

50:44.543 --> 50:46.461
Yep.

50:50.507 --> 50:52.426
Does it depress you?

50:54.010 --> 50:56.054
Well, February depresses me.

50:57.556 --> 50:59.641
Armageddon, I'm OK with.

50:59.808 --> 51:01.935
I mean...

51:02.102 --> 51:04.062
- What are you gonna do?
- (LAUGHS)

51:04.229 --> 51:07.107
- Hey, look. From the video.
- Hey, it's Frankenstein.

51:07.274 --> 51:09.568
- Sad.
- In the flesh.

51:09.735 --> 51:12.738
- A lot of flesh, bro.
- Shut the hell up and show her.

What's your emergency?

51:52.527 --> 51:55.197
(DISGUISED VOICE) There's a man
on the sidewalk passed out.

51:55.363 --> 51:57.365
I don't think he's breathing.

51:57.532 --> 51:59.034
What's the address?

51:59.201 --> 52:01.244
The Nestor building
on Hope Road.

52:01.411 --> 52:04.122
- I don't know the number.
- Paramedics are on their way.

52:04.289 --> 52:08.251
- Is the man injured?
- All I know is he won't wake up.
