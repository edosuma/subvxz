WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.309
'The Geordie squad are back.'

00:09.376 --> 00:11.644
This time, it's gonna be massive.

00:11.711 --> 00:14.214
Fuck off, Newcastle.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.883
We're gonna mission
around the party islands.

00:18.151 --> 00:22.255
(screaming)

00:22.322 --> 00:24.591
Things are about to get
Lionel Messi.

00:26.626 --> 00:29.095
There's gonna be pool parties.

00:29.162 --> 00:31.664
Boat parties.

00:31.731 --> 00:33.266
Paint parties.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.668
The biggest parties
of our fucking lives.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.071
More necking on.

00:39.806 --> 00:42.008
Oh, shit.

00:42.075 --> 00:44.611
There's gonna be
shit loads of bucking.

00:46.613 --> 00:49.082
Belly flop! Belly flop!

00:49.149 --> 00:50.784
Let's fucking do this.

00:53.153 --> 00:55.855
There's gonna be carnage.
Fucking little slag!

00:59.893 --> 01:01.928
Kick-offs.
(shouting)

01:01.995 --> 01:03.630
Marnie, Marnie!

01:05.665 --> 01:07.467
Drama.

01:10.036 --> 01:11.738
Oh, my God!
(siren)

01:11.805 --> 01:14.073
Let's get fucking mortal!

01:15.375 --> 01:18.445
This is the ultimate
party island crawl.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.750
(farts) Welcome to the girls' room,
you little radge packet!

01:26.519 --> 01:28.321
Oh, my God! It's Kyle.

01:30.323 --> 01:32.525
That's totally see-through now.

01:32.592 --> 01:35.695
I can't stop looking at her arse.
I know we're not together,

01:35.762 --> 01:37.163
but he's looking fit.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.800
Marty's pulled,
but I'm keeping my cool.

01:40.867 --> 01:44.137
I am not having Marty
upset my Chloe.

01:44.204 --> 01:47.640
Marnie swills the three of us.
Two can play at that game.

01:48.641 --> 01:52.278
Marnie has decided to throw her nose
in other people's businesses.

01:54.447 --> 01:57.650
You shouldn't take Marty's side
and go against us.

02:00.186 --> 02:03.256
The way she's going on,
I just don't see a future for us.

02:07.927 --> 02:10.330
I don't like you, you
and I don't like you.

02:10.395 --> 02:12.565
Marnie has been
such an amazing friend.

02:12.632 --> 02:17.504
I can't believe she stuck up for us.
Where's your friends? I got mine.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.572
For him to call me
that is disgusting.

02:19.639 --> 02:22.542
Why the fuck did I just say that?

02:22.609 --> 02:24.477
How can I like someone that nasty?

02:28.481 --> 02:30.450
I have a degree in pulling women.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.785
Never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

02:32.852 --> 02:35.922
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.258
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.627
I'm radge and I wrap
lads around my finger.

02:40.693 --> 02:42.662
I'm preened to perfection.

02:42.729 --> 02:44.564
I'm totally crackers me, like.

02:44.631 --> 02:46.799
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

02:46.866 --> 02:49.102
Me banter's pure naughty.

02:49.168 --> 02:51.204
I'm fake, flirty,
I've got double Fs.

02:51.271 --> 02:53.239
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

03:03.483 --> 03:05.251
How you feeling today, Chloe?

03:05.318 --> 03:06.619
Feeling a bit angry.

03:06.686 --> 03:07.820
Upset still.

03:07.887 --> 03:10.256
Last night, Marty was awful.

03:10.323 --> 03:13.159
He went in on my appearance
and my weight.

03:13.226 --> 03:16.629
He knew that would hurt me,
but he still did it.

03:16.696 --> 03:20.400
How could a boy literally
call you worse than shit?

03:20.466 --> 03:22.468
He's just not a nice lad.

03:22.535 --> 03:25.204
Anyway, how are you feeling?
What did Aaron say?

03:25.271 --> 03:28.741
Last night, me and Aaron
broke up cos I swilled Marty.

03:28.808 --> 03:31.744
But he's a dick. He shouldn't
put his friends before me.

03:31.811 --> 03:34.547
He chose Martin over me.
I hope it's worth it.

03:34.614 --> 03:37.884
For now, Me and Marnie need to
avoid Marty and Aaron

03:37.951 --> 03:39.218
like they've got herpes

03:39.285 --> 03:41.854
and try to enjoy the rest
of our time in Aiya Napa.

03:46.092 --> 03:48.061
You were fucking radge last night.

03:48.127 --> 03:51.798
I was trying to drag you away and
drag her away, I was just trying...

03:51.864 --> 03:53.333
You just wanted to battle.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.702
Marnie was bang out of order
last night,

03:55.768 --> 03:58.171
but I shouldn't have
went in on Chloe how I did.

03:58.237 --> 04:00.707
At some point,
I'm gonna have to apologise.

04:06.846 --> 04:08.881
I gave Marnie everything she wanted

04:08.948 --> 04:10.617
and she threw it back in my face.

04:10.683 --> 04:13.186
Her and Chloe
are welcome to each other.

04:13.252 --> 04:15.755
Anyway, howay.
The divide continues.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.228
Ah!

04:22.295 --> 04:26.065
I don't think I'm ready for this.
Oh, God, it burns.

04:26.132 --> 04:28.067
It's a horrible place to live.

04:28.134 --> 04:31.004
Not only did Marty and Chloe
have a huge row,

04:31.070 --> 04:34.140
but Aaron and Marnie broke up
and now they hate each other.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.175
Kyle came in at such a bad time.

04:36.242 --> 04:39.345
I feel bad for him,
cos he's in the middle. I feel bad.

04:39.412 --> 04:42.348
Even though I feel bad for Kyle,
I'm so glad he's here.

04:42.415 --> 04:44.384
He's the thing
keeping my spirits up.

04:44.450 --> 04:47.720
I just find the whole thing
pathetic that this is going on.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.989
I know.
Over someone getting swilled.

04:50.056 --> 04:52.325
I just want everyone
to be friends again.

05:00.333 --> 05:03.236
(phone rings)

05:05.872 --> 05:07.440
Hello?

05:07.507 --> 05:10.343
Oh, fuck.
It's that slave driver, Anna,

05:10.410 --> 05:13.112
which only means one thing, work!

05:17.950 --> 05:19.585
Ooh. Sounds fancy.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.655
Me, getting mortal,
at a party, in a pool.

05:22.722 --> 05:23.923
Buzzing!

05:26.726 --> 05:28.227
Yeah. Is that all right?

05:33.232 --> 05:36.035
Busted! How the fuck
does she know Kyle's here?

05:39.005 --> 05:41.741
Kyle, Anna knows that you're here.

05:41.808 --> 05:45.812
She says, "If you wanna make yourself
useful, we're going to work today."

05:45.878 --> 05:47.780
Fuck. Anna knows I'm here.

05:47.847 --> 05:51.084
I need to get to the pool party
and pretend to work.

05:51.150 --> 05:54.253
It shouldn't be hard.
I've been pretending all my life.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.658
Pool party!

05:58.725 --> 06:00.693
Look up.

06:00.760 --> 06:01.928
Run, bitch, run!

06:06.232 --> 06:09.669
We've all gotta work together,
so we have to put on a united front

06:09.736 --> 06:12.438
and just get on with it.
We're professionals.

06:18.644 --> 06:19.746
Hello, everyone!

06:19.812 --> 06:22.181
We get to work
and the atmosphere is amazing.

06:22.248 --> 06:24.050
These punters look well up for it.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.886
There's only one way forward.
Shots, shots, shots!

06:29.489 --> 06:31.924
Shot done. Let the games begin.

06:31.991 --> 06:33.726
Put this between your legs.

06:33.793 --> 06:36.429
Three, two, one, go!

06:36.496 --> 06:38.464
Chloe, next one!

06:38.531 --> 06:39.565
Chloe won!

06:40.600 --> 06:42.401
Loser, loser!

06:42.468 --> 06:43.803
Go!

06:47.206 --> 06:51.210
Come on, everyone, this is a pool
party. Get in the pool, you radgies!

07:00.153 --> 07:02.688
We've been at the pool party
nigh on ten minutes

07:02.755 --> 07:05.658
and I've noticed there's
half a bottle of vodka gone.

07:05.725 --> 07:08.628
I look over at Aaron,
and he's in a bad way.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.332
I don't give a shit about work.

07:13.399 --> 07:15.735
The way I'm feeling,
the last thing I wanna do

07:15.802 --> 07:17.403
is play happy families.

07:17.470 --> 07:20.206
As the day goes on,
the more angry I'm getting.

07:20.273 --> 07:23.009
Last night I was gutted,
but the more the day goes on,

07:23.075 --> 07:26.012
the more fucking pissed off I am.
I'm ready to explode.

07:26.078 --> 07:29.248
I've known Aaron a long time,
I've never seen him this angry.

07:29.315 --> 07:32.251
That just shows how devastated
he is about Marnie.

07:32.318 --> 07:35.454
And Marnie's off with Chloe
having the time of her life.

07:43.362 --> 07:45.898
Right, lads,
we're gonna do the bungee.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.200
Aye.
I can't.

07:47.266 --> 07:49.669
I can't do the bungee
cos my fucking knee,

07:49.735 --> 07:54.073
but right now, I'm absolutely raging
and I'm in no mood for fun.

07:59.345 --> 08:00.947
Oh, my God. They're going up.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.649
(laughter)

08:10.756 --> 08:12.758
I said nothing wrong last night.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.861
As always, I said nothing wrong.

08:14.927 --> 08:18.564
On the one hand, I've eaten too many
kebabs, so I'm too heavy to bungee

08:18.631 --> 08:22.802
and on the other, I'm stuck
with Aaron who hates Marnie. Great.

08:22.869 --> 08:26.038
I will never, ever, ever
pull that girl again.

08:26.105 --> 08:28.507
Relationship gone, friendship gone.

08:28.574 --> 08:30.977
That girl, to me, is done.
She's gutted.

08:31.043 --> 08:32.410
Good. Fucking good.

08:32.477 --> 08:33.746
Fuck.

08:33.813 --> 08:37.250
Aaron has a face like thunder
and looks like he's gonna blow.

08:37.316 --> 08:40.852
We're not together. Not my problem.
He's gonna have to deal with it.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.722
Last night, they kicked off.

08:42.788 --> 08:44.957
Tonight, I'm gonna kick off.

08:45.024 --> 08:48.828
The more I think about it,
the more fucking annoyed I am.

08:48.895 --> 08:51.330
Come on then, I'll argue.
Let's go.

08:51.397 --> 08:54.967
Let's go. Let's go.
You want one so badly.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.402
Say what you need to say.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.704
You want one so badly.

08:58.771 --> 09:00.539
I've never seen them like this.

09:00.606 --> 09:02.008
Fuck off.

09:02.074 --> 09:05.578
(talking over each other)

09:05.645 --> 09:07.747
I will never talk to you again.

09:07.813 --> 09:09.882
You ask for an argument,
then walk away.

09:09.949 --> 09:12.051
Ask for an argument,
then you walk away.

09:12.118 --> 09:14.120
Marnie, I'll never
talk to you again.

09:14.186 --> 09:16.489
I don't get it.
What the fuck am I doing?

09:16.555 --> 09:18.257
This makes me as bad as her.

09:18.324 --> 09:21.694
I'm gonna be the bigger person
as always, and walk away.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.531
Let's do this.

09:35.608 --> 09:39.345
That was the best buzz ever.

09:39.412 --> 09:43.082
I can't wait to see Kyle do it.
He's shitting himself.

09:44.517 --> 09:48.054
Fucking hell, what have I done?
I'm absolutely shitting it.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.899
Fuck, I think Kyle's
actually pissed himself.

09:59.966 --> 10:02.068
I can see it
dripping on his forehead.

10:02.134 --> 10:03.269
That's rank.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.638
There's piss dripping off your head.

10:06.872 --> 10:08.774
Is he passed out?

10:08.841 --> 10:11.043
I'm being deadly serious. Is he...

10:11.110 --> 10:13.179
Is he...
That's not funny.

10:13.245 --> 10:15.514
Oh, my God. I think Kyle's dead.

10:16.482 --> 10:19.585
Kyle!
Kyle! Are you all right?

10:19.652 --> 10:22.254
Kyle!
Kyle! Are you all right?

10:23.255 --> 10:24.957
Woo!

10:25.024 --> 10:29.095
(laughter, indistinct talking)

10:30.162 --> 10:33.065
That was horrible.
I thought he was dead.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.167
Did you pass out there?

10:35.234 --> 10:36.602
Just slightly.

10:39.238 --> 10:42.375
This pool party is absolutely shit,
thanks to Aaron.

10:42.441 --> 10:45.711
Let's get back to the villa
and get ready for tonight.

10:50.016 --> 10:52.218
I don't fucking deserve it.

10:52.284 --> 10:55.388
The way Aaron spoke to us really
hurt. It's like he hates us.

10:55.454 --> 10:59.425
I was hoping we were gonna speak, but
I don't know how it's gonna be fixed.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.528
I'm literally baffled
as to what I've done.

11:04.463 --> 11:08.167
I thought things were bad enough,
but I've made them ten times worse.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.369
I shoulda kept
my fucking mouth shut.

11:24.316 --> 11:27.086
It's mine.
Is it fuck. It's mine.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.488
Where's mine?
(laughter)

11:30.456 --> 11:32.358
Although work was fun,

11:32.425 --> 11:36.495
you could cut that tension
with a fucking knife.

11:36.562 --> 11:39.331
I tried to have a good time
and stay out of his way,

11:39.398 --> 11:40.666
but it made it worse.

11:40.733 --> 11:43.469
When's he gonna be
the boyfriend I fell in love with?

11:43.536 --> 11:46.772
Let's all stick together and have
fun tonight no matter what.

11:46.839 --> 11:48.841
Not gonna let anyone ruin it.

11:53.112 --> 11:56.782
Me and the girls are coming down
and the tension is still here.

11:56.849 --> 11:59.652
Why are the boys being so immature?

11:59.718 --> 12:01.420
Put it behind you and move along.

12:01.487 --> 12:03.122
Let's go.
Howay, then.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.626
Tonight, we need a fucking miracle
to kiss and make up.

12:07.693 --> 12:10.563
But I won't hold my breath.
We'll just get pissed.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.268
I'm not ready to forgive or forget.

12:17.269 --> 12:19.605
Since the girls went,
it's been a good night.

12:21.707 --> 12:23.242
Maybe we're not meant to be.

12:24.710 --> 12:28.481
She thinks she's wet now,
she'll be soaking in a minute.

12:29.849 --> 12:32.251
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

12:34.987 --> 12:35.187
.

12:37.756 --> 12:37.957
.

12:38.023 --> 12:41.494
'Warning, this part contains
even more strong language,

12:41.560 --> 12:43.262
sex talk and scenes.'

12:43.329 --> 12:45.731
'If that's not for you,
best turn over now."

12:45.798 --> 12:47.032
'You've been warned.'

12:50.436 --> 12:54.173
Tonight, half of the family
might hate each other,

12:54.240 --> 12:56.842
but we're gonna ignore it
and get mortal.

13:02.348 --> 13:05.885
(dance music)

13:17.630 --> 13:20.866
I've been feeling bad about
what I said to Chloe all day.

13:20.933 --> 13:22.935
I don't like seeing her
upset cos of me.

13:23.002 --> 13:25.571
It's time I man the fuck up
and apologise.

13:32.344 --> 13:34.780
I'm so glad Marty's apologised,

13:34.847 --> 13:38.651
but I don't think he realises
what he said really hurts us.

13:38.717 --> 13:41.520
So I'm not ready to forgive
or forget just yet.

13:48.794 --> 13:51.330
I'm actually glad
Chloe listened to me.

13:51.397 --> 13:54.466
It's a sign that she's willing
to make a friendship again.

14:11.850 --> 14:16.021
I really hope this is the start
of everyone sorting things out.

14:16.088 --> 14:18.490
Now all we need to do
is tackle Aaron and Marnie

14:18.557 --> 14:21.360
and hopefully this family
can get back together.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.068
Maybe one day
me and Aaron can fix this,

14:29.134 --> 14:32.404
but after the way he treated us
last night and how he spoke to us,

14:32.471 --> 14:34.773
I want nothing more to do with him.

14:38.677 --> 14:40.613
I'm trying to have a good night,

14:40.679 --> 14:43.148
but there's only so long
I can put a brave face on

14:43.215 --> 14:47.186
and pretend it's not bothering us
that Aaron's laughing. It's shit.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.896
Marnie really knows
the way to my heart.

14:57.963 --> 15:00.733
One mention of chicken nuggets
and back to the villa,

15:00.799 --> 15:04.837
I'm out of here quicker than you can
say drumstick. Fucking n'yaw.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.281
Thank fuck Marnie and Chloe
have left.

15:15.347 --> 15:18.150
Now I can concentrate on
having a wicked night.

15:19.885 --> 15:23.355
Time to build some bridges
and put this family back together.

15:39.571 --> 15:41.006
I feel really bad saying it,

15:41.073 --> 15:44.877
but since Marnie and Chloe left,
the atmosphere has lifted.

15:44.943 --> 15:47.179
Everyone's having a good night.

15:47.246 --> 15:50.015
I hope it stays like this
when we get back to the villa.

15:59.224 --> 16:00.893
We're having a mint night.

16:00.959 --> 16:04.330
Throwing chairs in the pool
and there's not a penis in sight.

16:04.396 --> 16:07.599
I'm not gonna lie,
Aaron was giving me evils.

16:07.666 --> 16:10.569
Me and Aaron have tried
to make it work, but it doesn't.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.572
It's horrible to think,
but maybe we're not meant to be.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.909
Do I just put all of my...
all of my principles aside

16:16.975 --> 16:20.045
just because I love someone?
Sometimes love is not enough.

16:28.854 --> 16:31.657
Me and Kyle are getting
flirtier every night.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.693
But we both know it wouldn't work.
We've tried.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.296
But obviously I care about him
and I always will.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.534
Me and Holly can't help but flirt,

16:42.601 --> 16:44.503
but I don't want to rush anything.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.305
But it's going so well, it's hard.

16:52.010 --> 16:55.013
Since the girls have gone,
it's been a good night.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.983
So I hope, when we go back,
there's no kick-offs.

17:00.285 --> 17:02.287
I never want to stop dancing.

17:02.354 --> 17:05.156
Tonight has been one of
the best nights I've ever had.

17:05.223 --> 17:07.760
I'm dancing all the way
to the fucking taxi home.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.338
You can fuck off as well.

17:19.405 --> 17:22.141
We get back to the villa
after having a wicked night,

17:22.207 --> 17:24.576
looks like Marnie and Chloe
have gone to bed.

17:24.643 --> 17:26.044
Thank fuck for that.

17:26.111 --> 17:28.446
It's been a positive night
for everyone.

17:30.449 --> 17:32.751
Don't fucking start.

17:37.189 --> 17:38.857
Yes, I am flirting with Holly.

17:38.924 --> 17:42.761
If she thinks she's wet now,
she'll be soaking in a minute.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.699
Me and Kyle have ended up
in the pool again.

17:47.766 --> 17:50.903
But you know what?
This a great end to the night.

17:50.969 --> 17:53.939
I'm holding on to you for dear life.
I know you are. Sorry.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.341
It's cos you fancy us, still.
I don't.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.810
Yes, you do.
I don't.

17:57.876 --> 17:59.211
You will always fancy me.

17:59.278 --> 18:01.780
I am not gonna make Kyle's head
any bigger

18:01.847 --> 18:04.016
by telling him I still fancy him,

18:04.082 --> 18:06.452
cos I think he already knows
I do anyway.

18:16.295 --> 18:19.765
We're in the kitchen and Holly takes
the flirting to the next level

18:19.832 --> 18:21.400
by putting a finger in my arse.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.502
Careful, you might lose your watch.

18:23.569 --> 18:25.370
(screaming)

18:27.573 --> 18:31.677
Oh, my God!
I have just seen Kyle's arse.

18:31.743 --> 18:33.579
That is one hairy hole.

18:33.645 --> 18:35.848
Something needs to be done
about that.

18:35.914 --> 18:37.850
(squeals)

18:39.485 --> 18:42.554
(laughter)

19:05.077 --> 19:09.014
I've woken up and I'm so glad
me and Marnie went home early

19:09.081 --> 19:12.451
cos we actually had such a good
night and there was no kick-offs.

19:12.518 --> 19:14.286
It takes a lot to apologise.

19:14.353 --> 19:17.222
It takes balls.
I wouldn't have done that.

19:17.289 --> 19:19.491
At least Marty
has apologised to Chloe.

19:19.558 --> 19:22.561
It really fucking hurts
that Aaron hasn't apologised.

19:22.628 --> 19:23.862
It's getting to us.

19:23.929 --> 19:26.331
How do you feel
apologising to Aaron?

19:26.398 --> 19:28.700
Are you gonna or not?
I probably would have

19:28.767 --> 19:31.970
if yesterday at work didn't happen.

19:32.037 --> 19:34.540
He was absolutely awful, so...

19:34.606 --> 19:37.376
I'm never, ever gonna apologise.
Never.

19:37.442 --> 19:39.678
This is the worst it's been for us.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.847
I want him to apologise.

19:41.914 --> 19:44.016
I don't know
if I can take much more.

19:56.929 --> 19:59.932
Once you start being civil,
you start getting on better.

19:59.998 --> 20:03.769
Then, gradually, you'll start
building a connection again.

20:03.835 --> 20:06.104
Thing is, I'm stubborn as fuck.

20:06.171 --> 20:07.839
Thing is, though, so is Marnie,

20:07.906 --> 20:10.442
Things between me and Marnie
are worse than ever

20:10.509 --> 20:13.178
and I don't know how much longer
I can take this.

20:13.245 --> 20:15.747
One of us
is gonna have to crack soon.

20:23.722 --> 20:26.491
We need to get the family together
and have a mint day.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.327
I've got the solution for us.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.228
What is everyone doing?

20:30.295 --> 20:33.098
Yeah!
I love the sound of scooters.

20:33.165 --> 20:34.566
Let's go!

20:44.009 --> 20:47.012
I really want this day
to work and fix the family.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.014
And the scooters look wicked.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.850
I just hope I don't end up
crashing into Kyle.

20:52.784 --> 20:55.320
Rock and roll!

20:55.387 --> 20:59.024
I'm mint at this. If only
driving a car was this easy.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.960
I'd have passed my test in a second.

21:09.668 --> 21:13.772
They say it's like riding a bike,
but doesn't look like Aaron learned.

21:16.842 --> 21:18.143
Level with Aaron

21:22.748 --> 21:25.150
You can't do that!
That's cheating.

21:37.162 --> 21:39.564
(cheering)

21:39.631 --> 21:43.869
Kyle's idea to ride scooters and
play golf was such a good idea.

21:43.935 --> 21:47.439
It's brought us all together. All I
need to do is make up with Aaron.

21:47.506 --> 21:48.607
That was so good.

21:48.674 --> 21:50.709
We all took the piss
out of her, as well.

21:50.776 --> 21:52.544
(all) Let's go!

21:56.481 --> 21:59.718
Having a cheeky flirt with Chloe,
but it means nothing.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.757
Fuck me, looks like I didn't even
have to make the first move.

22:07.559 --> 22:10.228
Last time she said that,
she pulled her fanny out.

22:10.295 --> 22:11.797
(shouts)
Aaron!

22:11.863 --> 22:14.766
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

22:16.535 --> 22:16.735
.

22:19.271 --> 22:19.504
.

22:19.571 --> 22:23.175
'Listen up, there's loads more
strong language and sexual scenes.'

22:23.241 --> 22:26.945
'If you are easily offended,
you know what to do, stop watching.'

22:39.991 --> 22:43.295
Me and the girls are getting ready,
and by the sound of things,

22:43.361 --> 22:45.097
they've had a wicked day,

22:45.163 --> 22:48.100
which is exactly what we wanted
from the start.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.602
Would you rather be friends,

22:50.669 --> 22:52.704
or would you rather try again?

22:52.771 --> 22:56.508
So, if I try again with Aaron,
I'm going against everything

22:56.575 --> 22:58.777
that I believe in.
Cos I love him, but...

22:58.844 --> 23:02.214
...I'm having a little fight
in my head at the minute.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.282
Mine and Aaron's history
is up and down

23:04.349 --> 23:06.184
and we're both fiery people,

23:06.251 --> 23:08.954
if we're gonna sort it out,
we best do it tonight.

23:13.091 --> 23:15.293
My plan was to get everyone
back together,

23:15.360 --> 23:17.462
that kind of worked.
We're on the verge.

23:17.529 --> 23:20.298
Once you speak to Marnie,
everyone will be sound.

23:20.365 --> 23:22.367
That's the main divide.

23:22.434 --> 23:25.170
Kyle's right,
the mood in the house is bad.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.073
Aaron needs to speak to Marnie
and sort this out.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.843
Fuck it. Let's just get pissed.

23:31.910 --> 23:35.280
Pissed. Done, done, done.
Last touches.

23:38.984 --> 23:41.186
I feel like today
was a really good day.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.855
Hopefully tonight,
we'll have a wicked night.

23:43.922 --> 23:46.291
(all) Cheers!

23:47.292 --> 23:49.561
Tonight is gonna be belter.

23:49.628 --> 23:51.496
Let's get fucking mortal.

23:51.563 --> 23:56.401
(shouting)

24:02.374 --> 24:05.210
We walk into the club
and it is absolutely bouncing.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.746
The music's amazing,
the drinks are flowing.

24:07.813 --> 24:10.649
I think tonight's actually
going to be a good night.

24:10.715 --> 24:12.684
Let's have a fucking wicked night.

24:12.751 --> 24:15.053
(shouting)

24:18.757 --> 24:21.459
I wanna speak to Aaron before
we have another drink

24:21.526 --> 24:23.895
and sort it out once and for all.

24:27.566 --> 24:31.403
I can see that Marnie is bothered
her and Aaron aren't talking.

24:31.469 --> 24:35.006
Just shows how much she likes him.
I hope it works out.

24:40.545 --> 24:44.282
I'm gonna bite the bullet, go over
there and stop acting like children.

24:51.990 --> 24:55.894
Fuck me, looks like I didn't even
have to make the first move.

24:55.961 --> 24:57.929
She won't be expecting this, though.

25:05.170 --> 25:09.841
Oh, my God. Aaron's apologised to us
before I could get a word in.

25:09.908 --> 25:11.309
He must love us after all.

25:20.452 --> 25:22.220
I'm glad I apologised first,

25:22.287 --> 25:25.056
I needed to be the bigger person,
swallow my pride

25:25.123 --> 25:26.925
and make her my girlfriend again.

25:28.793 --> 25:32.464
Me and Marnie are a nightmare
and we're both stubborn as fuck,

25:32.530 --> 25:36.001
but when it boils down to it,
we clearly love each other.

25:36.067 --> 25:40.171
I look over and Marnie and Aaron are
necking on. They're back together.

25:46.611 --> 25:48.246
Thank fuck for that.

25:48.313 --> 25:53.218
Aaron stopped being a stubborn
bastard and actually said sorry.

25:53.285 --> 25:56.054
Now we can all move on
and have a wicked time.

25:58.890 --> 26:03.628
I'm so happy right now and it's a
good time to apologise to Marty.

26:03.695 --> 26:07.065
For the sake of everyone.
It's not worth being pissed off.

26:13.471 --> 26:16.541
I'm glad Marnie's finally come over
and apologised.

26:16.608 --> 26:18.977
Hopefully now we can
put it all behind us

26:19.044 --> 26:20.478
and be one big happy family.

26:31.690 --> 26:33.858
Aaron's like the cat
that got the cream.

26:33.925 --> 26:37.329
I just hope this time, him and
Marnie are back together for good.

26:45.570 --> 26:48.506
This is the first time
I've seen Aaron smile in two days.

26:48.573 --> 26:50.942
I just hope this
is the end of the drama

26:51.009 --> 26:53.278
and we can get back
to having a laugh.

26:59.351 --> 27:02.587
I do like being friends with Chloe,
cos she's a fucking frisk.

27:02.654 --> 27:06.725
It's just a shame every time we try
and make it more, it goes west.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.964
Tonight is going so well.

27:13.031 --> 27:17.602
When you think it can't get better,
Marty tells us he's not gonna pull.

27:17.669 --> 27:19.270
Buzzing.

27:21.373 --> 27:24.442
I've decided for the family's sake,
for the rest of the time

27:24.509 --> 27:27.579
I'm not gonna pull. Hopefully
there will be no arguments

27:27.645 --> 27:30.215
between me and Chloe
and we can have a good time.

27:38.690 --> 27:40.759
Finally, everyone is talking.

27:40.825 --> 27:45.230
We're all on a massive love buzz.
Thank fuck for that.

28:02.313 --> 28:04.582
Tonight has actually
gone fucking wicked

28:04.649 --> 28:08.153
and I'm having a cheeky flirt
with Chloe, but it means nothing.

28:12.424 --> 28:16.461
Tonight has been mint and there's
only one thing left to do.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.296
Booze fight!

28:27.472 --> 28:28.840
We've had a great night.

28:28.907 --> 28:32.010
Everyone's friends, everyone's
mortal. Time to go home.

28:40.151 --> 28:42.287
My food! All mine!

28:43.755 --> 28:45.723
I am absolutely fucked.

28:45.790 --> 28:48.293
I'm taking myself straight to bed.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.229
Let's just raise a pizza slice

28:51.296 --> 28:52.997
to all of us getting on.

28:53.064 --> 28:55.200
Yeah.
All of us.

28:55.266 --> 28:57.202
Tonight has been wicked.

28:57.268 --> 28:58.937
The family is back together.

28:59.003 --> 29:01.706
Martin, come here.
I've got a surprise for you.

29:01.773 --> 29:04.008
What?

29:04.075 --> 29:06.344
No, it's not a surprise,
it's outside.

29:06.411 --> 29:09.547
I've decided I want to
give Marty a special present

29:09.614 --> 29:12.250
and not many lads
get a special present off me.

29:14.152 --> 29:16.287
I've got such a surprise for you.

29:16.354 --> 29:18.923
Sit on the seat.
Hold on, what's going on here?

29:18.990 --> 29:20.959
Chloe's saying she's got a surprise,

29:21.025 --> 29:23.628
last time she said that,
she pulled her fanny out.

29:25.263 --> 29:27.365
(laughter)

29:27.432 --> 29:28.867
Chicken in a bra?

29:28.933 --> 29:31.302
I've been given a lot
of presents in my time.

29:31.369 --> 29:33.037
But chicken in a bra?

29:33.104 --> 29:34.806
This has got to be a first.

29:34.873 --> 29:36.708
This girl has been tampered with.

29:36.774 --> 29:37.809
Bra of chicken.

29:39.744 --> 29:42.080
This is special,
cos I've put it on a plate,

29:42.147 --> 29:43.848
the bra is a plate.

29:43.915 --> 29:45.817
I thought we could
share it out here.

29:45.884 --> 29:49.220
I thought we could share it.
Obviously I'm having the big wing.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.389
Chicken is the glue
for me and Marty.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.825
Sitting here now with him,
having chicken

29:53.892 --> 29:56.928
brings back old memories.
I love them memories.

29:58.296 --> 29:59.464
What?

30:05.170 --> 30:08.273
I know, we're gonna forget.
We're gonna be friends.

30:10.441 --> 30:11.776
It's not gonna be.

30:11.843 --> 30:14.212
It's not ever gonna be.
Promise?

30:14.279 --> 30:16.548
Mm-hmm.
Actually promise.

30:16.614 --> 30:20.718
I'm promising you now,
I'm not gonna pull a girl

30:20.785 --> 30:22.053
for the rest of the time.

30:22.120 --> 30:25.523
This is all I've ever wanted,
for me and Marty to be friends.

30:25.590 --> 30:27.292
With us not going on the pull,

30:27.358 --> 30:29.527
I think we can get back to
how we used to be.

30:29.594 --> 30:31.296
Wanna give us a cuddle?

30:32.530 --> 30:34.566
You... you... you...

30:39.637 --> 30:41.973
You are the bread to my toast.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.542
I think it's better
we both get to bed

30:44.609 --> 30:46.844
before we do something we regret.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.225
(shouts)
Aaron!

31:00.291 --> 31:01.292
(laughs)

31:01.359 --> 31:03.361
I can't wait to have sex tonight.

31:03.428 --> 31:05.964
It's not gonna be good.
It's gonna be amazing

31:06.030 --> 31:07.899
cos me and Aaron are back together.

31:07.966 --> 31:11.669
That means chemistry,
passion, love-making.

31:22.914 --> 31:26.317
I'm taking you to get an arse wax.
It is winking at me.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.386
(screaming, laughter)

31:28.453 --> 31:30.555
Why do I feel like
I've been stitched up?

31:33.524 --> 31:36.461
I've been down this road.
I don't want to get hurt again.

31:36.527 --> 31:38.663
No, man. Go on.
How many drinks have I had?

31:39.964 --> 31:42.267
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

31:45.036 --> 31:45.236
.

31:47.805 --> 31:48.006
.

31:48.072 --> 31:52.043
'The very bad language and sexual
scenes continue in this part.'

31:52.110 --> 31:56.247
'Consider yourselves warned and turn
over if it's going to offend yous.'

32:09.794 --> 32:11.896
What's the matter?
Nothing.

32:11.963 --> 32:13.965
We're back here again.

32:14.032 --> 32:15.800
Can you believe it?
(laughs)

32:15.867 --> 32:17.468
Not a bad thing, is it?

32:17.535 --> 32:20.238
Last night Aaron surprised us
by apologising first

32:20.305 --> 32:22.307
and I'm so happy I'm his girlfriend.

32:22.373 --> 32:25.009
I know we're a nightmare,
but we're just so in love.

32:25.076 --> 32:26.611
We're gonna make it work.

32:27.879 --> 32:29.814
Third time lucky in three weeks.

32:29.881 --> 32:31.749
I'm glad I said sorry first.

32:31.816 --> 32:34.118
If saying sorry means
we end up in the shag pad

32:34.185 --> 32:36.487
I should say sorry more often.

32:36.554 --> 32:40.325
(both laugh)

32:42.694 --> 32:44.095
I feel ill.

32:44.162 --> 32:45.463
Fucked still.

32:45.530 --> 32:48.199
I might be hungover,
but last night was fun.

32:48.266 --> 32:50.735
We're back to being
an actual happy family.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.904
I think it was
bloody lovely last night.

32:52.970 --> 32:55.973
Me and Martin are friends
and I'm buzzing about it.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.376
I've woken up this morning
feeling amazing.

32:58.443 --> 33:00.211
Me and Marty are finally friends

33:00.278 --> 33:02.814
and I feel like now
I can enjoy the rest of my time.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.450
You and Kyle
seemed to be getting close.

33:05.516 --> 33:09.687
Me and Kyle don't ever get pretty
close, we're always close.

33:11.456 --> 33:13.925
I love having Kyle
back in the house,

33:13.991 --> 33:15.626
but it is really frustrating,

33:15.693 --> 33:19.530
because the more time we spend,
the more our feelings grow.

33:19.597 --> 33:23.768
I'll make you both breakfast.
No, thank you. Why not?

33:23.835 --> 33:26.971
It's a nice thought, but I don't
want to get food poisoning.

33:29.073 --> 33:30.341
Where's Aaron?

33:30.408 --> 33:32.643
I think he stayed in the shag pad.

33:32.710 --> 33:35.380
Aaron and Marnie make up,
they break up,

33:35.446 --> 33:38.249
that's what they do.
They're destined to be together

33:38.316 --> 33:41.919
cos when they're good, they are
amazing. Like me and Charlotte were.

33:41.986 --> 33:43.821
It's mint that we're getting on.

33:43.888 --> 33:47.058
It's the first time we've got on
since I've been here.

33:47.125 --> 33:50.428
The house is back together
and no-one's got a problem.

33:50.495 --> 33:51.729
It's class.

33:51.796 --> 33:56.467
I've woke up and the family
are back on track, back together.

33:56.534 --> 33:58.069
Do you wanna get breakfast?

33:58.136 --> 34:00.838
(both) No.

34:09.414 --> 34:11.382
After seeing Kyle's hairy hole,

34:11.449 --> 34:14.418
I'm making it my mission
to teach them hairy cavemen

34:14.485 --> 34:16.687
a thing or two about male grooming.

34:16.754 --> 34:18.856
Basically,
Kyle showed me his bumhole.

34:18.922 --> 34:20.658
and it's ridiculously hairy.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.860
I'm taking you
to get your arses waxed.

34:22.927 --> 34:26.164
Just to clarify, Nathan only caught
a glimpse of my man cave

34:26.230 --> 34:28.331
while Holly was poking around.

34:28.399 --> 34:31.702
But if everyone else is getting
their arse waxed, I'm up for it.

34:31.768 --> 34:34.772
Right, so we're having a waxing day?

34:35.706 --> 34:38.842
Yeah, a waxing day.
Definitely, Kyle. Tell you what,

34:38.909 --> 34:42.179
you go first, get your crack waxed
and we'll follow.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.315
This is too easy.

34:55.960 --> 34:59.964
I've decided to go first to show
there's nothing to worry about.

35:00.031 --> 35:03.201
(laughter)

35:03.267 --> 35:06.571
It was a funny idea to let Kyle
think we were all gonna get waxed,

35:06.637 --> 35:09.807
but now, I'm standing that close
to his arsehole,

35:09.874 --> 35:11.309
it is winking at me.

35:11.375 --> 35:14.245
The wax is on.

35:14.312 --> 35:15.880
It's burning, it's burning.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.015
(Kyle groaning)
Are you ready?

35:18.082 --> 35:19.817
Kyle, you're shaking.

35:19.884 --> 35:21.452
(all) Three, two, one, go!

35:21.519 --> 35:23.654
(Kyle whimpering)

35:23.721 --> 35:26.057
How did that feel?
(laughter)

35:26.123 --> 35:28.726
This is one of the funniest things
I've ever seen,

35:28.793 --> 35:33.064
but is it weird we're getting this
much enjoyment from Kyle's arsehole?

35:33.130 --> 35:36.934
(screaming, laughter)

35:37.001 --> 35:40.204
Kyle needs to take
male grooming very seriously.

35:40.271 --> 35:44.742
If he had as much hair on his head as
he does on his arse, he'd be fine.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.878
Last one!

35:46.944 --> 35:51.382
(screaming, cheering)

35:51.449 --> 35:53.451
Thank fuck that is over.

35:53.518 --> 35:56.621
I cannot wait to see them go through
what I've been through.

35:56.687 --> 35:58.022
So, lads, who's next?

35:58.089 --> 36:02.360
(laughter, indistinct banter)

36:02.426 --> 36:04.829
Why do I feel like
I've been stitched up?

36:04.896 --> 36:07.265
What an absolute bunch
of fucking knobs.

36:13.404 --> 36:15.540
At least they'll have
smooth bumholes.

36:15.606 --> 36:18.042
It doesn't bother me.
I've never seen Aaron's.

36:18.109 --> 36:20.344
Have you not?
Nah, I think... Nah.

36:20.411 --> 36:22.179
Never.
Maybe that's the problem.

36:22.246 --> 36:25.716
That is so weird. How can Marnie
never have seen Aaron's bumhole?

36:25.783 --> 36:27.618
No wonder they keep breaking up.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.887
You know the G spot's
in the bum hole? Yeah.

36:29.954 --> 36:32.456
That's why lads love having a shit.

36:32.523 --> 36:34.191
That's why.
(laughter)

36:37.361 --> 36:40.064
We're back!

36:40.131 --> 36:42.567
Me and my so called friends
get back to the villa

36:42.633 --> 36:45.903
and seeing as we bonded over
seeing every inch of my arsehole

36:45.970 --> 36:48.739
maybe the girls
would like to see it, too.

36:48.806 --> 36:52.043
You could probably eat
that jacket potato off his arsehole.

36:52.109 --> 36:56.147
(indistinct banter)

36:56.213 --> 36:57.381
She's eating!

36:57.448 --> 37:00.117
To be fair, that is one
well-groomed bumhole.

37:00.184 --> 37:02.853
But he's clearly not heard
of anal bleaching.

37:02.920 --> 37:06.090
So, you're happy with it now?
Aye, it really hurt, though.

37:14.365 --> 37:16.567
We're all looking mint,
the family's back

37:16.634 --> 37:19.503
and I'm looking forward
to an amazing night together.

37:19.570 --> 37:22.573
Cheers, everyone!
(all) Cheers!

37:33.150 --> 37:36.520
We get to the club and everyone
is so up for a big night.

37:36.587 --> 37:38.489
Bring it on.

37:38.556 --> 37:42.793
Let's just get pissed, have fun.
Cheers, everyone!

38:01.045 --> 38:04.749
I think we might have underestimated
Marty, cos none of the other lads

38:04.815 --> 38:07.418
have ever not pulled
to save someone's feelings.

38:07.485 --> 38:10.254
Maybe Marty's actually mature.
That's weird.

38:26.804 --> 38:29.373
Of all the lads,
I'm closest to Nathan.

38:29.440 --> 38:31.509
I've decided
we need a bonding session.

38:39.784 --> 38:41.986
Nipple piercing?
Is he coming on to me?

38:42.687 --> 38:45.156
Nah. This is to get me back
for the arse wax.

39:02.373 --> 39:06.377
Chloe, I know that
I'm really good looking,

39:06.444 --> 39:10.247
but that doesn't mean we're gonna
play hide the sausage anytime soon.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.860
Me and Marty are flirting like mad

39:22.927 --> 39:25.329
and I've just said
he looks like David Beckham

39:25.396 --> 39:26.931
How many drinks have I had?

39:29.600 --> 39:32.069
It's getting harder
to say no to Chloe.

39:32.136 --> 39:34.205
She's pulling out all the stops.

39:34.271 --> 39:36.574
I need to be strong
and keep saying no.

39:46.784 --> 39:50.988
Holly likes me, but she wants me
to admit I like her.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.957
So I'm gonna flip reverse this one.

40:00.164 --> 40:03.868
Maybe I do fancy Kyle, but this
isn't the time or the place.

40:03.934 --> 40:07.238
You know what? I've been there
before, I don't wanna get hurt.

40:08.105 --> 40:12.977
Since Kyle's been back, him and
Holly have been flirting so much.

40:13.043 --> 40:15.012
But what is going on?

40:19.784 --> 40:21.452
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

40:21.519 --> 40:24.722
This has been a wicked night.
It's mint when everyone gets on.

40:24.789 --> 40:27.925
But we need to get back to the villa
and carry on the party.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.869
Tonight has been the best night
I've had with this lot.

40:38.936 --> 40:41.238
If only we could manage it
for longer.

40:41.305 --> 40:44.408
It felt weird going out tonight
with no arguments.

40:45.109 --> 40:47.244
Nice, wasn't it?
Aye, wicked.

40:47.311 --> 40:48.979
I'm not counting me chickens.

40:49.046 --> 40:52.149
Tonight was wicked. I'm going
to bed so it stays that way.

40:52.216 --> 40:54.318
See yous later.
See you later, kid.

40:54.385 --> 40:56.487
What? Marty's going to bed?

40:56.554 --> 41:00.057
Not without me, he's not. I need to
be a ninja of getting to his pants

41:00.124 --> 41:02.960
so no-one finds out.
Cos everyone will be angry at us.

41:04.528 --> 41:06.063
Why are you getting in to bed?

41:06.130 --> 41:08.732
I might be tipsy,
but I know what I want.

41:08.799 --> 41:11.135
Operation get Marty's penis is a go.

41:11.202 --> 41:13.137
Don't be trying no monkey business.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.372
Never. Never.

41:15.439 --> 41:18.609
No. No monkey business,
just a little massage.

41:18.676 --> 41:20.411
One friend to another.

41:20.477 --> 41:22.213
Listen...

41:22.279 --> 41:25.616
No, man. Go on. Chloe, go to bed.

41:27.051 --> 41:29.887
I might be pissed,
but I know what you're up to

41:29.954 --> 41:32.690
and it's not gonna work.
Man's got willpower.

41:32.756 --> 41:34.959
Why are you stressing?
I wanna go to sleep.

41:35.025 --> 41:37.895
As much as I would love
to blast the arse off Chloe...

41:37.962 --> 41:40.698
Ow! Me toe!

41:40.764 --> 41:43.434
...I'll take one for the team
and put her into bed.

41:55.045 --> 41:57.982
Honestly, me and you have been
through so much, Kyle.

41:58.048 --> 42:00.885
I'm glad I've got you back
as me friend.

42:00.951 --> 42:03.988
I was happy
when you walked in this house.

42:04.054 --> 42:05.589
I wanted you here.

42:05.656 --> 42:08.359
I was already having
such a good time on this trip,

42:08.425 --> 42:11.095
but Kyle now being here
has made us so happy.

42:12.596 --> 42:16.267
Tell me you care about me more
than any other boy on this planet.

42:16.333 --> 42:19.603
Yes, you do. It's obvious
we both still like each other.

42:19.670 --> 42:21.805
But especially
what happened last time,

42:21.872 --> 42:24.041
we're just scared to go there again.

42:24.108 --> 42:25.743
Let's go to bed.
Come on.

42:25.809 --> 42:29.213
I think I've been kidding myself
pretending we can be friends

42:29.280 --> 42:32.149
when it's pretty obvious
we're much more than that.

42:32.216 --> 42:36.120
But I don't know if I should risk
what we've got by telling him.

42:41.358 --> 42:42.459
(screaming)

42:42.526 --> 42:44.461
How the fuck am I gonna do this?

42:44.528 --> 42:45.930
(screaming)

42:45.996 --> 42:47.331
What is going on?

42:47.398 --> 42:50.868
It's like some sort of low budget
version of Dirty Dancing.

42:50.935 --> 42:52.836
Fuck off!
Hello, Gary.

42:54.371 --> 42:56.607
That is fucking mental.

42:57.675 --> 42:58.876
Let's have it!

43:01.211 --> 43:03.013
Skinny dipping time!

43:03.080 --> 43:05.916
You need to pack your stuff,
you're on the next flight.

43:05.983 --> 43:07.117
Fuck off.

43:07.184 --> 43:09.920
Did I hear that right?
I can't let this happen again.

43:09.987 --> 43:12.323
I nearly lost him.
I've had so many laughs,

43:12.389 --> 43:13.891
I've had me heart broken,

43:13.958 --> 43:16.427
I've made best friends for life.

43:16.493 --> 43:20.130
I can't actually believe Holly's
choosing me over the house.

43:48.559 --> 43:48.759
.
