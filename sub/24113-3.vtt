you move out.

00:07.460 --> 00:08.830
Simon, watch out!

00:11.290 --> 00:12.580
What just happened?!

00:12.580 --> 00:14.170
Alec told me that Robert
proposed to you in Barcelona.

00:14.170 --> 00:15.750
How sweet that Alec

Look, it's for a good cause

00:37.330 --> 00:39.250

00:39.250 --> 00:42.290
Just tell your friends
it's open bar.

00:42.290 --> 00:44.330
Cool. I'll send you
an invite now.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.580
HELP! SOMEBODY HELP!
I NEED HELP!

01:37.460 --> 01:39.500
I was attacked

01:39.500 --> 01:41.040
He threw me

JONATHAN: Who are you
looking for, Jace?

02:00.920 --> 02:02.580
I'm right here.

02:02.580 --> 02:06.380
Right under your
little angelic nose

02:06.380 --> 02:08.670
It's you.
In the flesh.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.460
It's exhausting,
isn't it?

02:11.460 --> 02:14.250

Yeah. I'm... I'm good.

02:26.670 --> 02:28.330
It's four
in the morning.

02:28.330 --> 02:31.830
I just got back from patrol,
but what are you still doing up?

02:31.830 --> 02:33.830
I have to go through the rest
of this surveillance footage.

02:36.380 --> 02:38.330
By using
your Stamina Rune?

02:44.420 --> 02:46.000
Jace, at some point,
you've got to get--

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I can sleep
when I find him.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.830
You also have to
take care of yourself.

02:59.210 --> 03:02.540
Seven mundanes have been
murdered in the last 48 hours.

03:04.920 --> 03:07.000
I think I know
who's responsible.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.670
You ID'd the Owl?

03:09.710 --> 03:13.460
The Clave has no record
of an owl-faced demon.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.330
Or a demon that possesses
people that way.

03:18.210 --> 03:19.710
That face has to
be a glamour.

03:19.710 --> 03:22.790
For who? Who'd want
to hide themselves?

03:24.420 --> 03:25.620
I think the Owl...

03:25.620 --> 03:27.080
is Jonathan.

me a call if anything changes.

03:57.210 --> 03:58.540
Please tell me he's OK.

03:58.540 --> 04:01.290
He's pretty banged up. You broke
his hip and shattered his knee.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.540
Oh, no.

04:04.540 --> 04:05.750
Well, at least
wolves heal fast.

04:05.750 --> 04:08.120
Not in this case. He's not
healing the way he should.

04:09.620 --> 04:10.920
Great.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.710
They wanted me dead
before this happened.

04:12.710 --> 04:15.080
Just lay low, and steer clear
of the Jade Wolf.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.710
I'm gonna go smooth things over
with the pack.

04:21.540 --> 04:22.710
I don't understand.

04:22.710 --> 04:23.830
I didn't even touch him.

04:23.830 --> 04:25.330
You didn't have to.

04:25.330 --> 04:26.460
It was your forehead.

04:26.460 --> 04:28.880
It was glowing...

04:28.880 --> 04:31.250
with like a...
mark or something.

04:32.380 --> 04:33.380
It looked like this.

04:46.830 --> 04:49.000
"Though you walk in the
daylight, darkness will follow."

04:49.000 --> 04:50.420
Huh?

04:50.420 --> 04:51.920
The Seelie Queen,
she said it to me

04:51.920 --> 04:54.580
before she tattooed
this on my face.

04:54.580 --> 04:55.830
Where are you going?

04:55.830 --> 04:57.380
To pay her majesty
a little visit.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.380
Simon, wait.

04:58.380 --> 05:01.830
She gave you that mark
before she let you go.

05:01.830 --> 05:03.620
You going back
could be...

05:03.620 --> 05:06.750
Exactly what her messed-up
little Seelie brain wants.

05:06.750 --> 05:08.460
She could trap
you there forever!

05:08.460 --> 05:10.540
I can't just crawl
in some hole and hide.

05:10.540 --> 05:12.460
Maybe Clary's seen
this before.

05:12.460 --> 05:14.380
Look, I have to find
out what this is.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.540
Whatever that
vampire did,

05:16.540 --> 05:18.000
Glenn may never
walk again.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.750
Well, he shouldn't have come
after Simon in the first place.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.120
You're defending him?

05:21.120 --> 05:22.880
No. I'm just saying that
the wolf was out of line.

05:22.880 --> 05:24.120
You all were.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.330
What the hell do you expect?
You put a filthy vampire

05:26.330 --> 05:27.540
under our noses, allowed
him to sleep with

05:27.540 --> 05:28.540
our women, what's next?!

05:28.540 --> 05:30.420
Maia is not anyone's woman.

05:30.420 --> 05:32.170
And drop the bass in your voice
when you talk to me.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.080
We're werewolves, Luke.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.500
Having a vampire here is
asking for trouble,

05:38.500 --> 05:39.880
let alone one with
that kind of power.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.290
Look, Simon said he didn't
mean to hurt anybody.

05:42.290 --> 05:44.250
I believe him. He's
a good kid, all right?

05:44.250 --> 05:45.920
I get it. He's like
a son to you.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.460
But you get this:

05:47.460 --> 05:48.880
We're your pack.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.620
We're the ones you're
supposed to protect.

05:50.620 --> 05:52.290
And I will.

05:52.290 --> 05:54.380
I just don't wanna act until I
know exactly what's going on.

05:56.750 --> 05:58.500
Sooner or later, you're
gonna have to pick a side.

06:08.750 --> 06:09.830
There you are!

06:09.830 --> 06:12.080
Good news: the Core
is off the ley line grid

06:12.080 --> 06:13.920
and free of
demonic corruption.

06:16.170 --> 06:17.580
That's good news.
Thank you.

06:21.290 --> 06:22.540
All righty then...

06:24.000 --> 06:25.750
I'll make
myself scarce.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.500
We just got a fire
message from Mom,

06:27.500 --> 06:30.080
saying she's "dropping by"

06:30.080 --> 06:33.170
for an impromptu
"family dinner."

06:33.170 --> 06:34.540
Those are a lot
of air quotes.

06:34.540 --> 06:36.790
Mom doesn't just
drop by for anything.

06:36.790 --> 06:39.460
IZZY: Yeah. We're thinking it
has to do with her and Dad.

06:39.460 --> 06:41.620
They're finally making
their divorce official.

06:41.620 --> 06:43.540
My condolences.

06:43.540 --> 06:46.790
It's for the best. Problem is,
instead of just being sad

06:46.790 --> 06:49.000
like a normal person,
she starts trying

06:49.000 --> 06:50.750
to fix everyone around her.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.960
Which usually includes
grilling her children

06:52.960 --> 06:55.540
on everything she thinks
is going wrong in their lives.

06:57.210 --> 07:00.080
So... where are you holding
this suspenseful dinner?

07:00.080 --> 07:01.620
Definitely not here.

07:01.620 --> 07:04.420
The Institute tends to bring out
her inner Inquisitor.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.460
How about my place?

07:08.670 --> 07:10.210
Magnus, you don't have to--

07:10.210 --> 07:12.580
I insist. You can have the place
all to yourselves.

07:13.580 --> 07:15.080
Wait. You should be there.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.120
Hm-mm...

07:16.120 --> 07:18.290
Think about it:
if Magnus is there

07:18.290 --> 07:20.620
being his usual charming self...

07:22.500 --> 07:23.920
Mom won't have time
to interrogate us.

07:25.670 --> 07:26.830
I am charming.

07:27.830 --> 07:29.170
You don't think
it's too much?

07:29.170 --> 07:31.170
"Too much"
is my middle name.

07:33.080 --> 07:36.170
Look, clearly this
is important to you.

07:36.170 --> 07:38.620
Ergo... it's
important to me.

07:38.620 --> 07:40.420
Hmm?

07:44.330 --> 07:47.540
ROSA: Of all the workers
in the nursing home,

07:47.540 --> 07:50.670
you are my favorite one.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.460
I don't work
at the nursing home, Rosa.

07:53.460 --> 07:54.580
I'm just a friend.

07:54.580 --> 07:58.920
Oh, whoever you are,
I'm having a ball.

08:00.580 --> 08:01.580
Me too.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.670
You know...

08:11.670 --> 08:15.710

remind me of.

08:20.540 --> 08:22.710
My big brother!

08:25.750 --> 08:27.790
Oh...

08:27.790 --> 08:29.710
What was his name?

08:30.790 --> 08:32.120
Raphael.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.580
You know him?

08:35.540 --> 08:37.670
Yeah. He's told me
stories before.

08:39.830 --> 08:41.710
When you were
a little girl,

08:41.710 --> 08:44.210
your family moved here
from Mexico City,

08:44.210 --> 08:46.080
and you were
terribly homesick.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.170
Nobody seemed
to notice...

08:48.170 --> 08:51.170
Except Raphael.

08:51.170 --> 08:52.790
And whenever you
were feeling down...

08:55.580 --> 08:56.620
...he'd sneak you
up to the roof

08:56.620 --> 08:59.460
and... point at
all the stars.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.080
And he said...

09:03.080 --> 09:06.790
They're the same stars
in Mexico.

09:06.790 --> 09:07.920
Yeah!

09:09.830 --> 09:11.210
Oh...

09:13.580 --> 09:16.330
But then he ran away.

09:16.330 --> 09:18.290

say why.

if you ever felt lonely,

09:52.710 --> 09:55.750
all you had to do is look

13:49.500 --> 13:51.460
Hey. I need
to talk to Clary.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.670
I'm a grown vampire, Fray.
I can handle this.

13:57.540 --> 13:58.710
Thanks.

14:05.170 --> 14:06.750
Did you get any sleep?

14:08.620 --> 14:10.920
This is Morgan Young,
the Owl's latest victim,

14:10.920 --> 14:13.080
except she escaped
before he possessed her.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.580
How'd she manage that?

14:14.580 --> 14:16.250
She got him in the face
with pepper spray.

14:17.210 --> 14:18.710
That wouldn't
affect a demon.

14:18.710 --> 14:19.960
No, it wouldn't.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.500
It means the Owl
is part human,

14:21.500 --> 14:23.040
the same as Jonathan.

14:25.120 --> 14:26.500
Jace...

14:27.750 --> 14:29.880
Look, we've tried
how many times?

14:31.040 --> 14:33.330
There's been no activity
on the Connection Rune.

14:34.330 --> 14:36.040
They never found his body.

14:36.040 --> 14:38.620
Because he's probably in the
middle of the ocean somewhere!

14:38.620 --> 14:41.250
Jace, you saw him
in that river.

14:41.250 --> 14:43.170
Jonathan was dead.

14:46.290 --> 14:47.670
So was I...

14:48.830 --> 14:50.170
...until you
brought me back.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.120
Do you think this
is because of the wish?

15:01.830 --> 15:03.250
Ever since Lake Lyn,

15:03.250 --> 15:06.170
I've been having
dreams about Jonathan.

15:06.170 --> 15:09.670
Which are probably
just that: dreams.

15:09.670 --> 15:12.170
Like your dreams
about the Mortal Mirror?

15:12.170 --> 15:13.920
They all ended up
being true.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.460
Maryse wants
to have dinner

15:17.460 --> 15:19.500
with Alec, Izzy and I
later on tonight,

15:19.500 --> 15:20.880
but I think this
is more important.

15:20.880 --> 15:23.290
Morgan is throwing a fundraiser
for disaster relief.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.580
If I know anything
about Jonathan,

15:24.580 --> 15:27.080
he will be there
to finish what he started.

15:27.080 --> 15:28.540
Then we should
tell the others.

15:28.540 --> 15:31.750
No. He had spies
in the Institute before.

15:31.750 --> 15:33.170
I don't want anything
to tip him off.

15:33.170 --> 15:36.000
When he attacks again,
we'll be there to stop him.

15:49.380 --> 15:51.000
Rosa?

15:55.250 --> 15:56.210
Oh, yes.

This time, the victim
got away.

18:06.170 --> 18:07.880
I was thinking,

18:07.880 --> 18:09.500
could this be
a warlock?

18:09.500 --> 18:12.290
I told you.
Don't mention stuff

18:12.290 --> 18:13.290
while we're here.

18:13.290 --> 18:15.040
Nobody's listening.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.330
But they might start if we
keep whispering like this.

18:18.460 --> 18:20.830
Relax. I won't
mention it to anybody

What do you mean
"need to know"?

18:23.920 --> 18:25.380
Whom else did you tell?

18:25.380 --> 18:26.750
Well, obviously Sam.

18:26.750 --> 18:28.380
She's my partner.

18:28.380 --> 18:30.540
And emergency contact
in case I get mauled

18:30.540 --> 18:32.120
by a vampire
or something.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.290
Kidding.

18:33.290 --> 18:34.790
Sort of.

18:35.790 --> 18:37.210
I don't think
you appreciate

18:37.210 --> 18:39.380
how much danger
this puts her in.

18:42.790 --> 18:44.210
Now...

18:44.210 --> 18:45.670
you want to show me
that file?

18:54.830 --> 18:57.080
Wow. Look at you.

18:57.080 --> 18:58.920
It's not easy
finding something cute

18:58.920 --> 19:00.250
that can accommodate
a weapon.

19:01.880 --> 19:02.880
Izzy...

19:02.880 --> 19:04.920
have you...

19:04.920 --> 19:07.120
have noticed
anything...

19:07.120 --> 19:09.420
different about Jace?

19:09.420 --> 19:10.710
No...

19:10.710 --> 19:13.210
Well, you do see him
a lot more than I do.

19:16.210 --> 19:17.380
What's wrong?

19:20.210 --> 19:22.540
He thinks the Owl
is Jonathan.

19:22.540 --> 19:25.620
What

19:25.620 --> 19:27.710
He keeps having
these dreams about him.

19:27.710 --> 19:30.540
He thinks
they're prophetic.

19:30.540 --> 19:32.120
What do you think?

19:33.170 --> 19:34.330
I don't know.

19:34.330 --> 19:36.460
He hasn't
been sleeping.

19:36.460 --> 19:38.880
He's been using his Stamina Rune
to stay on mission.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.460
When you don't sleep, your mind
can play tricks on you.

19:41.460 --> 19:43.580
Yeah.
Has he told Alec?

19:44.620 --> 19:46.250
He's afraid that once
word gets out,

19:46.250 --> 19:47.420
it'll tip off Jonathan.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.420
I'm coming with you.

19:53.420 --> 19:54.880
What about your family dinner?

19:54.880 --> 19:56.620
If the Owl is Jonathan,

19:56.620 --> 19:57.670
we've way got bigger problems

19:57.670 --> 19:59.040
than missing dinner with Mom.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.380
There's no way I'm
letting you guys

20:01.380 --> 20:02.380
go out there alone.

20:07.330 --> 20:09.120
Are you sure this
is exactly half a cup?

20:09.120 --> 20:11.080
Cooking is an art,
not a science.

20:11.080 --> 20:14.040
If that were true, then there
wouldn't be instructions.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.040
Hmm.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.380
Now, this is
an old family recipe.

20:17.380 --> 20:19.290
Izzy and I found it right
after my grandmother died.

20:19.290 --> 20:22.750
My mother
was inconsolable

20:22.750 --> 20:24.790
until the day we
made her this stew.

20:24.790 --> 20:26.960
That was the first time
that I saw her smile.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.420
Well, you're
a sweet man, Alexander.

20:31.170 --> 20:33.250
And so adorable
with radish in your hair.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.500
Here.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.960
Oh! Whoa.

20:37.960 --> 20:38.960
Yeah.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.330
OK.

20:40.330 --> 20:42.420
How is that

20:42.420 --> 20:43.790
Mm! Mm-hmm!
Yeah?

20:43.790 --> 20:44.880
OK!

20:50.960 --> 20:52.080
Oh, God!

20:55.540 --> 20:58.330
Izzy... texted.

20:58.330 --> 20:59.330
Out, out, out, out.

20:59.330 --> 21:01.830
She's going on mission
with Clary and Jace...

21:03.380 --> 21:05.710
...which means that
it's just me tonight.

21:05.710 --> 21:07.670
Just us.

21:07.670 --> 21:09.500
OK?

21:11.960 --> 21:14.330
OK. Remember,
my mother is on edge

21:14.330 --> 21:15.670
and that means avoiding
any sensitive subjects,

21:15.670 --> 21:17.580
like my dad, or like
that I turned down

21:17.580 --> 21:18.830
that job at the Clave.
Or the fact

21:18.830 --> 21:20.420
that you're dating
a dastardly warlock?

21:20.420 --> 21:21.460
Hmm?

21:23.460 --> 21:25.710
I'm sorry. Am I
being terrible?

21:25.710 --> 21:28.330
No, no, no.
You're just tense.

21:28.330 --> 21:29.920
Here.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.170
Drink this.

21:34.380 --> 21:35.210
I'm OK.

21:36.250 --> 21:37.540
You're OK?
Oh, I'm OK.

21:37.540 --> 21:38.540
OK.

21:39.830 --> 21:41.500
You're OK.

21:44.420 --> 21:46.120
My boys!

21:46.120 --> 21:47.460
Oh!

21:47.460 --> 21:49.420
Oh, oh, oh...

21:50.420 --> 21:52.290
I'm far from being
a boy, but...

21:52.290 --> 21:53.710
I appreciate
the sentiment.

21:53.710 --> 21:55.290
My apologies.

21:55.290 --> 21:57.380
I should respect my elders.

21:57.380 --> 21:58.460
Can I get you
a drink?

21:59.620 --> 22:02.380
How about a round
of Magnus' famous cocktails?

22:04.040 --> 22:05.620
This is your mother on edge?

22:06.420 --> 22:07.420
Hmm...

22:22.620 --> 22:23.960
Beautiful night.

22:27.420 --> 22:28.420
Or not.

22:34.540 --> 22:35.920
Raphael, I need
to talk to you.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.580
Not now.

22:38.580 --> 22:40.920
I wouldn't be here if I
didn't need your help.

22:44.170 --> 22:45.290
I said...

22:45.290 --> 22:49.460
"not... now"... Daylighter.

22:49.460 --> 22:51.540
Funny you should
mention that!

22:51.540 --> 22:53.620
Some really strange
stuff has gone down

22:53.620 --> 22:55.080
and I was wondering if it
might be because of that...

22:55.080 --> 22:57.380
Daylighter legend
you talked about.

22:57.380 --> 22:59.540
Your little "lost boy" act
doesn't work with me, Lewis.

23:00.540 --> 23:03.170
If you knew me better, you might
find I'm actually pretty lost.

23:06.790 --> 23:09.040
Twice I offered
to help you...

23:09.040 --> 23:11.290
if you told me how you
became a Daylighter.

23:12.290 --> 23:15.330
And twice you refused.

23:15.330 --> 23:17.170
Which, from your
perspective, I get.

23:17.170 --> 23:18.380
Super frustrating,
right?

23:18.380 --> 23:20.040
But the thing is I
really don't know.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.540
And it might help
if you tell me

23:21.540 --> 23:23.000
a little bit about this
Daylighter legend--

23:23.000 --> 23:26.250
I SAID "NOT NOW"!

23:30.880 --> 23:33.250
Oh! Oh!

23:34.250 --> 23:36.330
Raphael! Are you OK?

23:37.330 --> 23:38.750
Stay away from me.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.620
I'm serious.

23:48.620 --> 23:51.000
Truman Capote was
a total closet warlock.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.580
And he never knew
when to leave.

23:53.710 --> 23:57.000
"I'd like to stay here the
entire night drinking cognac

23:57.000 --> 23:59.670
and regaling you all
with all my stories."

24:00.790 --> 24:02.580
Well, you do know
how to host.

24:02.580 --> 24:05.710
Oh, please.
Tonight was all Alec.

24:05.710 --> 24:07.250
Really?
Mm-hmm.

24:07.250 --> 24:09.880
That stew was incredible.
Who knew you could cook?

24:09.880 --> 24:11.330
Well, I've made
that for you before.

24:11.330 --> 24:12.960
Ah, how could
I forget?

24:14.170 --> 24:17.120
Alec and Isabelle made this for
me when they were little kids.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.000
To see the looks
on their faces

24:19.000 --> 24:21.120
when they brought it to me...

24:21.120 --> 24:22.670
It still
warms my heart.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.380
But that stew!

24:24.380 --> 24:25.540
I still have nightmares!

24:25.540 --> 24:27.580
I.. I thought you
loved that stew.

24:27.580 --> 24:28.670
Well, I do now!

24:28.670 --> 24:30.670
Whatever you've done to the
recipe, it's unrecognizable.

24:33.540 --> 24:36.080
Would anyone
care for a digestif?

24:36.080 --> 24:37.250
Mm... no,
thank you.

24:37.250 --> 24:39.500
I'm probably embarrassing
Alec as it is.

24:39.500 --> 24:43.120
Oh, we're just happy to see you
in such good spirits.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.670
We thought you
might be upset...

24:45.670 --> 24:47.790
what, with the...

24:47.790 --> 24:49.670
divorce and everything.

24:52.460 --> 24:54.170
I've made my peace
with that.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.080
But your instincts are right.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.040
I do have some unpleasant news.

25:01.330 --> 25:02.620
I wanted Isabelle
and Jace

25:02.620 --> 25:04.250
to be here, but...

25:04.250 --> 25:05.620
you need to know.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.540
In light of Malachi's coup,

25:10.540 --> 25:12.540
the Clave has reopened
its investigation

25:12.540 --> 25:13.710
of former Circle members.

25:13.710 --> 25:16.750
You had nothing
to do with Malachi.

25:16.750 --> 25:18.290
Still...

25:18.290 --> 25:21.500
based on a review of
my actions in the Circle,

25:21.500 --> 25:23.620
the Clave has reclassified
me a traitor.

25:23.620 --> 25:24.710
What?
They're stripping me

25:24.710 --> 25:26.250
of my runes. In a few days,

25:26.250 --> 25:28.750
it'll be announced that I have
been exiled from Alicante.

25:28.750 --> 25:31.830
This is completely unjust.
You've given

25:31.830 --> 25:32.670
your life to the Clave!

25:37.580 --> 25:39.040
I'll go and check
on the desserts.
