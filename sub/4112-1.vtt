00:12.878 --> 00:15.210
Took a job

00:15.280 --> 00:17.680
Working late

00:17.749 --> 00:21.845
Jacking cars from out of state

00:59.258 --> 01:00.316
Who's there?

01:03.629 --> 01:05.153
Who's there?

01:19.845 --> 01:20.937
Help!

01:45.971 --> 01:47.598
What do you want?

02:30.949 --> 02:33.577
"Some say the world will end in fire

02:34.920 --> 02:36.717
"Some say in ice

02:37.756 --> 02:42.455
"From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire

02:44.629 --> 02:47.154
"But if I had to perish twice

02:49.134 --> 02:51.728
"I think I know enough of hate

02:51.803 --> 02:54.829
"To say that for destruction ice

02:56.608 --> 02:58.439
"Is also great

03:00.278 --> 03:02.075
"And would suffice"

03:03.081 --> 03:05.709
You know, I've got an English final.

03:06.451 --> 03:08.009
I gotta focus.

03:22.934 --> 03:24.333
Marry me.

03:25.570 --> 03:26.696
No.

03:35.547 --> 03:36.912
Marry me.

03:41.586 --> 03:43.019
Change me.

03:48.794 --> 03:50.694
Okay, I will if you marry me.

03:50.762 --> 03:52.923
It's called a compromise.

03:58.170 --> 04:00.468
Let's just call it coercion.

04:00.539 --> 04:02.097
It's not fair.

04:03.642 --> 04:05.769
Marriage is just...

04:05.844 --> 04:07.835
It's a piece of paper.

04:09.881 --> 04:13.214
Where I'm from,
it's the way one says, "I love you."

04:14.886 --> 04:18.083
Well, where I come from, at my age,

04:20.091 --> 04:23.117
it's the way one says,
"I just got knocked up."

04:26.364 --> 04:30.095
So, you're worried
about what people will think?

04:31.870 --> 04:35.203
You know,
two out of three marriages end in divorce.

04:36.341 --> 04:41.745
Well, I think you'll find
the vampirelhuman divorce rate

04:41.813 --> 04:43.610
is a little lower.

04:48.587 --> 04:50.054
So marry me.

04:54.526 --> 04:55.925
I can't.

04:57.996 --> 05:00.123
I have to be back at 4:00.

05:23.488 --> 05:25.547
4:00 on the dot.

05:25.991 --> 05:29.051
That kid trying to brown-nose me now
or something?

05:29.761 --> 05:33.253
He has a name.
Now he's too punctual for you?

05:41.640 --> 05:42.834
Okay.

05:44.576 --> 05:46.942
You understand
why you're being punished, right?

05:47.612 --> 05:49.944
I know, I put you through hell.

05:50.015 --> 05:51.607
Yes, you did.

05:53.318 --> 05:56.344
But I have other reasons for grounding you.

05:56.421 --> 05:57.718
Like...

06:01.927 --> 06:04.862
I just want you to get some separation
from him.

06:07.766 --> 06:10.291
Dad, there's nothing you can say.

06:12.704 --> 06:14.399
Edward is in my life.

06:16.908 --> 06:18.967
Yeah, I'm gathering that.

06:21.079 --> 06:23.639
So, all right, how about this?

06:24.349 --> 06:26.249
I'll make you a deal.

06:27.285 --> 06:29.845
You're not grounded anymore

06:32.223 --> 06:37.092
if you use your new-found freedom to
see some of your other friends, too, like...

06:37.929 --> 06:38.953
Like Jacob.

06:39.764 --> 06:41.459
He's going through
a really tough time right now.

06:41.533 --> 06:43.728
His dad's really worried about him.

06:44.235 --> 06:46.533
I remember when that was you.

06:48.206 --> 06:49.605
You needed a friend.

06:49.975 --> 06:51.567
Jake was there.

06:55.947 --> 06:58.381
Hey, it's Jake. Leave a message.

07:01.152 --> 07:03.450
Jacob hadn't talked to me in weeks.

07:04.189 --> 07:08.125
I wanted to fix it, he just...
He wouldn't give me the chance.

07:09.928 --> 07:13.386
And tumbling, tumbling

07:14.099 --> 07:17.159
Don't go fascination

07:18.536 --> 07:25.442
If just for tonight darling, let's get lost

07:27.479 --> 07:30.380
If just for tonight darling

07:32.150 --> 07:34.448
Let's get lost

07:36.488 --> 07:40.788
If just for tonight darling

07:40.859 --> 07:43.384
Let's get lost

08:00.812 --> 08:02.439
You scared me.

08:05.617 --> 08:06.982
You're going down to the reservation.

08:08.119 --> 08:09.677
How did you...

08:10.155 --> 08:11.383
Alice.

08:14.893 --> 08:16.383
Hey, did you do this to my truck?

08:17.662 --> 08:19.687
Bella, you have to understand.

08:19.798 --> 08:21.527
Your safety is everything to me.

08:21.599 --> 08:23.032
Jacob's not gonna hurt me.

08:23.101 --> 08:25.831
Not intentionally,
but the wolves have no control.

08:25.904 --> 08:26.928
Edward.

08:27.572 --> 08:31.303
I have until graduation to see him.

08:34.578 --> 08:36.604
And then I'll be one of you,

08:36.948 --> 08:38.414
and he'll hate me forever.

08:38.817 --> 08:40.511
Well, I'm sorry.

08:52.497 --> 08:54.727
- No way. Stop.
- Throw it away.

08:54.799 --> 08:56.130
- Good.
- Hey.

08:56.201 --> 08:58.761
- Just in time. All right, check it out.
- All right. Let's see, we got.

08:58.837 --> 09:01.362
- "My fellow students." Right?
- Good.

09:01.439 --> 09:03.737
- Cute.
- Right? "We are the future.

09:03.808 --> 09:06.106
"Anything is possible, if you just believe."

09:06.177 --> 09:07.337
Nice.

09:08.246 --> 09:09.235
Perfect.

09:09.314 --> 09:10.542
And you got yourself a speech.

09:10.615 --> 09:13.880
No, this'll be my speech when I want
everyone to throw diplomas at my head.

09:13.952 --> 09:15.544
So, thank you.

09:17.322 --> 09:18.653
You gotta embrace the clichés, Jess.

09:18.723 --> 09:21.089
They are the bread and butter
of all valedictorians.

09:21.593 --> 09:23.720
And that is why you are not valedictorian.

09:23.795 --> 09:25.922
Jess doesn't need clichés.

09:25.997 --> 09:27.089
The speech is gonna be epic.

09:27.899 --> 09:29.764
Epic? It'll change lives.

09:30.969 --> 09:32.163
I've decided to throw a party.

09:33.071 --> 09:35.437
After all, how many times
are we gonna graduate high school?

09:36.174 --> 09:37.664
A party? At your place?

09:39.811 --> 09:40.903
I've never seen your house.

09:40.979 --> 09:42.503
No one's ever seen their house.

09:42.747 --> 09:44.271
Another party, Alice?

09:44.616 --> 09:45.708
It'll be fun.

09:45.784 --> 09:47.479
Yeah. That's what you said last time.

09:52.991 --> 09:54.015
- Hey, Angela.
- Yeah?

09:54.092 --> 09:55.081
Do you need some help with those?

10:01.099 --> 10:03.158
...be sending money
'cause it's the polite thing to do,

10:03.234 --> 10:04.292
and then you'll be raking it in.

10:04.369 --> 10:06.394
Wait a minute. People give you money?

10:25.490 --> 10:27.549
I know you know what she saw. Tell me.

10:27.826 --> 10:29.453
It was nothing.

10:30.495 --> 10:32.224
You looked worried.

10:33.731 --> 10:36.598
Just that everyone noticed
how strange Alice is.

10:38.069 --> 10:40.037
I think that ship sailed long ago.

10:43.374 --> 10:45.239
I wonder what's wrong.

10:45.310 --> 10:48.074
Their son went missing in Seattle
over a year ago.

10:48.213 --> 10:50.807
Charlie's doing what he can, but...

10:53.751 --> 10:55.582
You know something about this?

10:58.690 --> 11:01.523
We've been tracking the situation in Seattle
for a while.

11:02.060 --> 11:04.927
Unexplained disappearances. Killings.

11:05.730 --> 11:10.030
If the situation gets any more conspicuous,
the Volturi will step in.

11:11.970 --> 11:14.097
If they go to Seattle, they could come here.

11:14.172 --> 11:15.639
They could see I'm still human.

11:15.707 --> 11:17.299
It won't get that far.

11:17.508 --> 11:20.238
But we'll go to Seattle if we have to.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.974
- I'll fax these down, first thing.
- Thank you.

11:26.117 --> 11:27.675
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:29.420 --> 11:31.615
- You ready for dinner?
- Yeah.

11:31.956 --> 11:34.754
It is still just you and I, right?

11:35.860 --> 11:38.158
No, I'm just dropping her off.

11:38.963 --> 11:40.021
See you later.

11:40.131 --> 11:41.291
Bye.

11:43.968 --> 11:47.426
Bella, my parents wanted to remind you
about the airline ticket

11:47.505 --> 11:50.474
- you got for your birthday.
- What airline ticket?

11:52.143 --> 11:54.771
A round trip ticket to see Mom in Florida.

11:55.713 --> 11:57.078
That was generous.

11:57.148 --> 11:59.582
It expires soon,
so you might want to use it this weekend.

11:59.651 --> 12:02.643
Well, I can't just drop everything and go.

12:03.354 --> 12:05.982
It might be your last chance to see her
before you graduate.

12:07.292 --> 12:09.192
Might not be a bad idea.

12:09.260 --> 12:12.627
Get out of town for a couple days.
Get some distance.

12:13.932 --> 12:15.092
Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing Mom.

12:17.035 --> 12:19.196
As long as you use the companion ticket.

12:19.270 --> 12:21.397
Wait. There's two tickets?

12:23.908 --> 12:25.239
Super.

12:25.576 --> 12:27.771
That makes me really happy.

12:30.348 --> 12:32.646
I did want to see my mom.

12:32.717 --> 12:36.278
I wanted to know
that her life was full and satisfying.

12:38.523 --> 12:40.684
Aren't you gonna miss this?

12:41.159 --> 12:44.560
Can't you just feel the vitamin D
soaking up in your pores?

12:48.333 --> 12:50.460
Yeah, I am gonna miss this.

12:52.470 --> 12:55.303
You know, colleges in Florida
are a lot sunnier.

12:59.877 --> 13:02.471
I'm just saying,
if you go to the University of Alaska,

13:02.547 --> 13:04.572
I'm never gonna see you.

13:09.220 --> 13:11.120
They have a really great science program.

13:12.290 --> 13:13.848
You mean, Edward program?

13:16.961 --> 13:18.986
The way he watches you,

13:19.397 --> 13:23.026
it's like he's willing to leap in front of you
and take a bullet or something.

13:23.668 --> 13:25.465
Is that a bad thing?

13:26.170 --> 13:27.535
It's an intense thing.

13:28.706 --> 13:30.765
You're different with him.

13:31.743 --> 13:33.335
He moves, you move.

13:33.911 --> 13:35.503
Like magnets.

13:36.881 --> 13:38.712
I don't know, we're just...

13:39.283 --> 13:41.649
In love. I get it.

13:42.987 --> 13:46.946
I just want to make sure
you're making the right choices for you.

13:47.258 --> 13:49.692
You know, 'cause you're the one
that's gonna have to live with them.

13:53.698 --> 13:56.360
All right, enough with the heavy.

14:03.441 --> 14:04.533
Mom.

14:04.609 --> 14:06.440
Congraduation.

14:06.511 --> 14:08.274
I didn't want you
to spend any of your money.

14:08.346 --> 14:10.109
I didn't, come on.

14:23.594 --> 14:25.789
- Are these all our old trip T-shirts?
- Mmm-hmm.

14:25.863 --> 14:28.263
- Get out!
- I saved them all.

14:28.332 --> 14:31.358
I thought they'd make a good quilt,
keep you warm up in Alaska.

14:32.970 --> 14:35.404
Remember this one? Ensenada.

14:36.074 --> 14:38.042
- The Snake Pit.
- Yeah.

14:38.810 --> 14:41.472
But this one is my favorite, here.

14:41.546 --> 14:43.605
The three-headed lobster from Maine.

14:43.948 --> 14:46.678
- This is amazing.
- Honey, I'm glad you like it.

14:46.751 --> 14:48.241
I just figured, you know,
when you get older,

14:48.319 --> 14:49.616
have kids, we can add to it.

14:49.687 --> 14:52.554
Maybe go visit the world's largest
ketchup bottle or something.

14:52.623 --> 14:53.920
Thanks.

14:56.461 --> 14:58.326
I'm glad you like it.

14:58.863 --> 15:02.299
Just thought you should have
a little piece of me up there in Alaska.

15:04.869 --> 15:06.700
- Mom...
- Yeah?

15:10.475 --> 15:11.942
I miss you.

15:12.443 --> 15:14.911
Honey, I miss you, too.

15:33.131 --> 15:35.031
Are you sure this is where you saw her?

15:36.200 --> 15:37.963
She's almost here.

15:50.982 --> 15:51.971
On your left!

16:28.085 --> 16:29.177
Wait!

16:29.453 --> 16:30.750
She's in their territory.

16:32.623 --> 16:33.885
She'll get away!

16:35.593 --> 16:37.151
No, she won't!

17:12.762 --> 17:13.820
Emmett, no!

17:47.498 --> 17:48.624
Do you regret going?

17:50.835 --> 17:51.893
No.

17:53.571 --> 17:55.835
It was really great seeing my mom.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.674
Just really hard saying goodbye.

17:59.010 --> 18:01.137
It doesn't have to be goodbye.

18:01.212 --> 18:03.339
Is that why you asked me to go?

18:03.481 --> 18:06.314
You thought I was gonna change my mind?

18:07.018 --> 18:09.213
I'm always hoping for that.

18:10.821 --> 18:12.015
What?

18:13.524 --> 18:16.357
If I asked you to stay in the car, would you?

18:22.667 --> 18:24.032
Of course not.

18:36.547 --> 18:37.741
Hey.

18:38.949 --> 18:40.348
Charlie said you left town.

18:40.584 --> 18:42.814
Yeah. To visit my mom. Why?

18:43.788 --> 18:46.518
He's checking to see if you're still human.

18:47.458 --> 18:48.720
Look, I'm here to warn you.

18:49.927 --> 18:51.588
If your kind come on our land again...

18:52.363 --> 18:53.387
Wait, what?

18:56.233 --> 18:57.257
You didn't tell her?

18:57.668 --> 18:58.862
Just leave it alone, Jacob.

19:00.971 --> 19:01.960
Tell me what?

19:03.074 --> 19:06.043
Emmett and Paul had a misunderstanding.

19:06.310 --> 19:08.073
It's nothing to worry about.

19:08.145 --> 19:09.476
Listen to you.

19:09.980 --> 19:11.675
Did you lie to get her out of town, too?

19:11.749 --> 19:13.478
You should just leave.

19:14.051 --> 19:15.075
Now.

19:15.886 --> 19:17.979
She has a right to know.

19:18.656 --> 19:20.214
She is the one the redhead wants.

19:22.360 --> 19:23.418
Victoria?

19:25.229 --> 19:26.856
Alice's vision.

19:27.898 --> 19:29.923
I was trying to protect you.

19:30.267 --> 19:31.928
By lying to me.

19:35.039 --> 19:37.701
Okay, we're gonna talk about this, but...

19:37.775 --> 19:38.901
You.

19:39.577 --> 19:41.943
Why haven't you called me back?

19:44.515 --> 19:46.449
I had nothing to say.

19:48.719 --> 19:51.210
- Well, I have tons. Hold on.
- Hey.

19:53.190 --> 19:54.521
Bella.

19:54.892 --> 19:56.519
Edward, you have to trust me.

19:56.594 --> 19:58.186
I do trust you.

19:58.863 --> 20:00.228
It's him I don't trust.

20:12.009 --> 20:14.842
Hey, lose the grin, Jacob.
We're just going for a ride.

20:14.912 --> 20:15.936
Hold on tight.

20:21.018 --> 20:24.078
Last born of the clan

20:24.155 --> 20:27.283
First one to be free

20:27.358 --> 20:30.350
Lived inside a house

20:30.428 --> 20:32.589
Are you sure this is a good idea?

20:34.665 --> 20:36.633
I am the vampire girl, remember?

20:37.802 --> 20:39.201
Hey, look who's back!

20:39.437 --> 20:40.426
What up, Bella?

20:40.504 --> 20:42.165
- Quil? You, too?
- Yep.

20:42.506 --> 20:43.666
Finally made the pack.

20:44.241 --> 20:45.265
I'm glad you're here, Bella.

20:45.342 --> 20:48.004
Maybe we can get a break
from Jake's obsessive inner monologue.

20:48.078 --> 20:49.170
"I wish Bella would call."

20:49.647 --> 20:50.978
"I wish Bella wouldn't call."

20:51.048 --> 20:53.846
- "Maybe I should call Bella."
- "Maybe I should call Bella and hang up."

20:55.186 --> 20:57.313
All right, you can shut up now.

21:00.191 --> 21:03.718
Bella, this is Leah Clearwater,
Harry's daughter.

21:04.295 --> 21:07.321
Hey. I'm really sorry about your father.

21:07.765 --> 21:10.131
If you're here to torture Jacob some more,
feel free to leave.

21:13.904 --> 21:15.030
Fun, isn't she?

21:16.273 --> 21:18.867
- Bella, hi!
- Hey.

21:19.176 --> 21:22.043
I was wondering
when we'd see your face around here again.

21:22.112 --> 21:23.477
Yeah. Same here.

21:23.647 --> 21:24.636
Sam, we good?

21:25.282 --> 21:28.376
We're good. She won't be getting
through our line any time soon.

21:28.452 --> 21:30.443
- Cool.
- Yeah, that's right boys!

21:39.730 --> 21:42.062
So when did Leah join the pack?

21:42.533 --> 21:46.196
Around when her dad died.
Her brother, Seth, also phased.

21:47.037 --> 21:50.302
He's only 15,
one of the youngest we've had.

21:51.175 --> 21:54.508
Sam keeps him home studying,
but he's chomping at the bit.

21:55.312 --> 21:57.109
I wish it was Leah who'd stay home.

21:58.315 --> 22:00.510
Come on, don't be such a guy.

22:00.584 --> 22:03.052
No, it's not a chick thing.

22:03.454 --> 22:06.218
It's, you know, a triangle thing.

22:06.857 --> 22:10.452
We all have to live
the LeahlSamlEmily pain-fest.

22:11.896 --> 22:13.227
Wolf telepathy, remember?

22:13.931 --> 22:16.058
So Sam dumps Leah for Emily?

22:16.734 --> 22:20.602
Yeah, it wasn't like that.
Sam hates himself for hurting Leah.

22:21.906 --> 22:23.931
But Emily was the one.

22:25.242 --> 22:28.040
I guess it sort of chooses you sometimes.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.014
It's more than some crush, Bella.

22:32.082 --> 22:34.243
Sam imprinted on Emily.

22:36.153 --> 22:38.348
Do I even want to know what that is?

22:47.531 --> 22:50.193
Imprinting on someone is like...

22:52.570 --> 22:54.629
Like when you see her,

22:55.906 --> 22:57.703
everything changes.

22:59.209 --> 23:03.009
All of a sudden,
it's not gravity holding you to the planet.

23:04.114 --> 23:05.411
It's her.

23:06.317 --> 23:08.182
Nothing else matters.

23:09.420 --> 23:11.445
You would do anything,

23:13.057 --> 23:14.786
be anything for her.

23:17.795 --> 23:20.059
Sounds like you know the feeling.

23:23.901 --> 23:25.232
Have you

23:27.338 --> 23:29.306
imprinted on someone?

23:34.411 --> 23:35.901
You'd know if I had.

23:40.084 --> 23:43.110
I just have a direct line to Sam's thoughts.

23:44.922 --> 23:46.651
So for now you're

23:47.191 --> 23:48.453
still you.

23:51.095 --> 23:53.120
And you're still you.

23:54.298 --> 23:55.458
Yeah.

24:01.005 --> 24:02.302
Until graduation.

24:04.108 --> 24:05.439
Graduation?

24:07.077 --> 24:08.806
You knew this was gonna happen.

24:08.879 --> 24:09.971
Not in a month!

24:12.483 --> 24:16.419
I mean, not before you've...
You've even lived.

24:17.888 --> 24:19.480
Or before I could...

24:23.394 --> 24:27.125
For a second, just a second, I thought...

24:29.133 --> 24:31.363
But he's got his hooks in you so deep...

24:33.003 --> 24:34.834
I decided this, not him.

24:34.905 --> 24:37.271
Bella, they're not even alive.

24:38.275 --> 24:39.833
It makes me sick.

24:42.513 --> 24:45.311
Better you really be dead than one of them.

24:58.629 --> 25:00.062
I can't believe you said that.

25:04.735 --> 25:06.965
Edward was right, I shouldn't have come.

25:07.037 --> 25:09.938
Bella, come on. Please.

25:13.077 --> 25:14.271
I'm sorry.

26:24.014 --> 26:28.314
You know, Edward could
at least respect meal times.

26:29.119 --> 26:30.381
I was just with Jake.

26:31.255 --> 26:32.244
Oh.

26:33.524 --> 26:34.821
Good.

26:39.429 --> 26:42.762
I'll just give you two some privacy, then.

26:45.102 --> 26:47.070
- Hey.
- Do you understand how worried I've been?

26:47.471 --> 26:48.904
I was perfectly safe.

26:48.972 --> 26:51.133
I almost broke the treaty to make sure.

26:52.209 --> 26:55.303
- I know I smell like a dog. I'm sorry.
- No, something's wrong.

27:02.486 --> 27:04.147
Edward, what's wrong?

27:04.221 --> 27:06.212
Someone's been in here.

27:11.395 --> 27:13.886
Who was it?
Someone we know?

27:14.832 --> 27:17.926
This stranger, I didn't recognize his scent.

27:18.001 --> 27:19.662
A nomad passing through?

27:19.736 --> 27:21.704
A passerby wouldn't
have left Bella's father alive.

27:22.206 --> 27:26.108
The scent disappeared
about 5 miles south of Bella's house.

27:26.977 --> 27:28.877
Someone's orchestrating this.

27:28.946 --> 27:30.311
Victoria?

27:30.981 --> 27:32.539
I would have seen her decide.

27:32.783 --> 27:33.875
Has to be the Volturi.

27:34.585 --> 27:37.213
I don't think it's the Volturi, either.

27:37.287 --> 27:39.050
I've been watching Aro's decisions, too.

27:39.122 --> 27:40.453
So we keep looking.

27:40.524 --> 27:42.958
We'll also take shifts
guarding Bella at her house.

27:43.460 --> 27:44.859
Another protection detail?

27:45.362 --> 27:46.659
Rosalie.

27:47.731 --> 27:48.720
No, she's right.

27:49.199 --> 27:53.636
You can't protect me, watch my dad
and search for the intruder.

27:53.704 --> 27:55.467
And for Victoria.

27:55.539 --> 27:57.200
And keep yourselves fed.

27:57.274 --> 27:59.071
I'm not leaving you here defenseless.

27:59.142 --> 28:01.702
Well, I'm not gonna let you starve.

28:02.179 --> 28:04.170
And I wouldn't be unprotected. I have...

28:06.183 --> 28:07.411
What?

28:15.292 --> 28:17.522
Whoever it was, he left his stink behind.

28:18.228 --> 28:21.959
It'll be hard to miss when we cross it again.
We'll handle it from here.

28:22.165 --> 28:24.827
We don't need you to handle anything.

28:24.902 --> 28:25.994
Or anyone.

28:26.069 --> 28:27.730
I could care less what you need.

28:27.804 --> 28:29.738
All right, we're done here.

28:29.806 --> 28:31.774
- No, you're done here.
- Stop!

28:32.609 --> 28:36.101
I'm tired of this.
From now on, I'm Switzerland, okay?

28:37.447 --> 28:39.381
Edward hated the idea,

28:39.449 --> 28:42.145
but it wasn't about rivalry anymore.

28:42.853 --> 28:45.583
It was about my safety, and Charlie's.

28:46.657 --> 28:51.094
In the days that followed,
I got them to at least try to work together.

28:55.999 --> 28:59.196
The wolves took over
so the Cullens could hunt.

29:01.672 --> 29:04.266
It wasn't exactly an easy alliance.

29:20.624 --> 29:21.886
Doesn't he own a shirt?

29:27.130 --> 29:28.427
I'm good here. You should go.

29:29.199 --> 29:31.326
I'm not gonna be gone long.

29:31.401 --> 29:33.961
Don't rush. You need to hunt.

29:50.687 --> 29:52.621
Maybe rush a little bit.

29:58.261 --> 30:00.058
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hi.

30:10.974 --> 30:12.737
So, what do you wanna do today?

30:12.809 --> 30:15.801
Bike, hike, just hang? Your call.

30:16.313 --> 30:18.213
But we're going to a party tonight.

30:21.084 --> 30:22.949
Are you sure this is okay?

30:23.553 --> 30:25.851
I really hate being a party crasher.

30:26.256 --> 30:28.952
Technically,
you're a council meeting crasher.

30:29.693 --> 30:34.357
You see? The council leaders,
Dad, Quil's grandpa and Sue Clearwater.

30:35.332 --> 30:37.323
She took over for Harry when he died.

30:37.401 --> 30:39.198
Okay, I should not be here.

30:39.870 --> 30:42.395
You're okay. I thought...

30:43.507 --> 30:47.204
I mean, they thought it would
be good for you to hear the histories.

30:47.277 --> 30:48.835
The histories?

30:49.413 --> 30:52.314
The tribe's histories? Aren't they secret?

30:53.150 --> 30:56.779
We all got a role to play,
and you're part of this.

30:57.587 --> 31:00.613
I mean, it's the first time
Seth, Leah and Quil'll hear them, too.

31:00.690 --> 31:03.853
But you are the first outsider. Ever.

31:06.263 --> 31:09.164
If I had known that, I would have, like...

31:10.067 --> 31:12.467
- I don't know, dressed better.
- Jake!

31:13.737 --> 31:16.729
- Hey.
- It's about time you got here.

31:16.807 --> 31:19.833
Paul's been hoovering the grub,
but I saved you some burgers.

31:19.910 --> 31:21.741
Good looking out, bro.

31:22.012 --> 31:24.947
Bella, this is Seth Clearwater,
Leah's brother.

31:25.015 --> 31:26.346
- Hi.
- Newest member of the pack.

31:27.084 --> 31:29.177
Newest. Bestest. Brightest.

31:29.252 --> 31:30.742
And slowest.

31:33.457 --> 31:36.358
- Come on, your dad's about to start.
- Okay.

31:37.761 --> 31:41.424
The Quileutes have been a small tribe
from the beginning,

31:42.065 --> 31:45.091
but we have always had magic in our blood.

31:46.803 --> 31:48.532
We were great spirit warriors,

31:49.172 --> 31:53.700
shape-shifters that transformed
to the powerful wolf.

31:55.645 --> 31:59.137
This enabled us to scare off our enemies

31:59.382 --> 32:01.475
and protect our tribe.

32:03.520 --> 32:08.082
One day,
our warriors came across a creature.

32:09.593 --> 32:11.618
It looked like a man,

32:11.695 --> 32:13.890
but it was hard like stone

32:14.664 --> 32:16.529
and cold as ice.

32:36.720 --> 32:40.781
Our warriors' sharp teeth
finally tore it apart,

32:40.857 --> 32:44.054
but only fire would completely destroy it.

32:45.462 --> 32:48.795
They lived in fear
that the cold man was not alone.

32:50.500 --> 32:51.865
And they were right.

32:56.239 --> 32:59.208
She took her vengeance out on the village.

33:01.845 --> 33:04.177
Our elder chief, Taha Aki,

33:04.247 --> 33:09.344
was the only spirit warrior left
to save the tribe after his son was killed.

33:21.698 --> 33:25.190
Taha Aki's third wife
could see that he would lose.

33:26.469 --> 33:29.768
The third wife was no magical being,

33:30.473 --> 33:32.703
with no special powers but one,

33:34.744 --> 33:35.972
courage.

33:47.557 --> 33:50.720
The third wife's sacrifice
distracted the cold woman

33:50.794 --> 33:53.388
long enough for Taha Aki to destroy her.

33:54.965 --> 33:57.229
She saved the tribe.

33:57.734 --> 34:00.828
Over time, our enemies have disappeared.

34:02.005 --> 34:03.802
But one remains,

34:05.308 --> 34:06.798
the cold ones.

34:09.746 --> 34:12.043
Our magic awakens when they're near,

34:12.315 --> 34:14.179
and we sense it now.

34:14.251 --> 34:15.684
We feel the threat in our blood.

34:18.088 --> 34:20.215
Something terrible is coming,

34:22.259 --> 34:24.625
and we must all be ready,

34:25.594 --> 34:26.891
all of us.

34:54.190 --> 34:56.181
What did you do to me?

35:00.263 --> 35:01.787
I'm so...

35:01.865 --> 35:04.095
Yeah. I know.

35:05.735 --> 35:06.963
We'll find you someone to drink.

35:07.470 --> 35:08.459
Mine!

35:15.812 --> 35:18.508
Just try not to get killed, will you?

35:21.918 --> 35:23.977
I'm gonna need numbers.

35:25.355 --> 35:27.585
Seattle is in a state of terror.

35:27.657 --> 35:31.525
Police are baffled by
the escalating murders and disappearances.

35:31.594 --> 35:35.496
Theories range from a vicious new gang
to a wildly active serial killer.

35:35.565 --> 35:36.589
Reporting live...

35:36.666 --> 35:39.965
It's getting worse.
We're going to have to do something.

35:40.704 --> 35:44.470
It takes more than one of our kind
to cause the damage they're reporting.

35:44.741 --> 35:48.700
Quite a few more.
And they're undisciplined, conspicuous.

35:48.778 --> 35:50.143
It's newborns.

35:51.848 --> 35:53.679
What, like new vampires?

35:53.750 --> 35:55.775
In the first few months after the change.

35:55.852 --> 35:59.447
That's when
we're at our most uncontrollable. Vicious.

36:00.223 --> 36:01.986
Insane with thirst.

36:02.525 --> 36:04.789
Something to look forward to.

36:06.663 --> 36:09.723
No one's trained these newborns,
but this isn't random.

36:10.734 --> 36:12.725
Someone's creating an army.

36:13.103 --> 36:15.196
Well, now we're definitely going to Seattle.

36:16.272 --> 36:17.967
An army of vampires?

36:18.041 --> 36:20.032
And they've been created to fight someone.

36:20.110 --> 36:21.805
We're the only clan even close to Seattle.

36:21.878 --> 36:23.345
Regardless of why
they were made,

36:23.413 --> 36:26.541
if we don't put a stop to them,
the Volturi will.

36:26.616 --> 36:28.675
I'm surprised they've let it go on this long.

36:28.752 --> 36:30.185
Maybe they're behind it.

36:31.454 --> 36:34.150
In Italy, I read Aro's mind.

36:34.224 --> 36:35.987
He wants me and Alice to join him,

36:36.059 --> 36:39.222
but he knows we'll never choose him
as long as our family's still alive.

36:39.295 --> 36:41.957
An army could solve that for him.

36:50.607 --> 36:51.767
Hey.

36:52.642 --> 36:54.439
Did you eat dinner yet?

36:56.346 --> 36:58.041
No, I haven't.

37:01.384 --> 37:05.650
This kid, Riley Biers,
disappeared over a year ago,

37:06.756 --> 37:10.317
and his poor parents have been papering
Seattle with these things ever since.

37:12.362 --> 37:13.886
You think they should just give up?

37:16.900 --> 37:19.528
Well, I wouldn't if it were you.

37:21.971 --> 37:23.370
Not ever.

37:29.712 --> 37:31.612
I have to figure out
what to tell people.

37:32.782 --> 37:35.444
Why I won't be home for Christmases,

37:36.085 --> 37:38.280
and why I won't visit,

37:39.923 --> 37:42.448
why they'll never see me again.

37:42.692 --> 37:46.526
After a few decades,
everyone you know will be dead.

37:49.265 --> 37:50.596
Problem solved.

37:55.805 --> 37:58.296
Why are you so against
me becoming like you?

37:58.842 --> 38:00.434
I've told you.

38:03.513 --> 38:05.242
Be honest with me.

38:06.549 --> 38:08.016
There's more.

38:08.485 --> 38:12.945
I know the consequences
of this choice you're making.

38:18.194 --> 38:19.593
I've lived through it.

38:21.464 --> 38:24.092
And to let you suffer that...

38:25.635 --> 38:29.230
You believe I have a soul, and I don't.

38:32.742 --> 38:34.334
But to risk yours,

38:34.410 --> 38:37.504
just for the sake of
never having to lose you,

38:39.816 --> 38:42.080
that's the most selfish thing I'll ever do.

38:46.489 --> 38:50.482
I thought that you were afraid
that I'd be too different.

38:52.662 --> 38:57.861
You know, like, I wouldn't be warm,
and I wouldn't smell the same.

39:07.610 --> 39:09.237
You'll always be my Bella.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.491
My Bella, just less fragile.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.573
Gosh, it's so pretty here.

39:52.155 --> 39:55.215
So, Alice has planned
a big graduation party.

39:56.359 --> 39:57.451
Which you're invited to.

40:02.165 --> 40:04.827
Yeah, I figured that.

40:12.575 --> 40:13.735
What?

40:15.712 --> 40:18.237
I just wanted to do this differently.

40:18.648 --> 40:19.979
Smoother.

40:21.551 --> 40:23.485
But now I'm out of time.

40:24.821 --> 40:26.118
Do what?

40:26.990 --> 40:29.618
You need to hear the truth, Bella,

40:30.259 --> 40:32.591
understand all your options.

40:34.163 --> 40:35.926
And you need to know

40:37.500 --> 40:39.730
that I'm in love with you,

40:41.204 --> 40:44.230
and I want you to choose me
instead of him.

40:46.275 --> 40:48.470
I thought you understood.

40:51.314 --> 40:53.782
- I don't feel that way for you.
- I don't buy it.

40:53.850 --> 40:55.750
What don't you buy?

40:57.253 --> 40:58.550
That's how I feel.

40:59.322 --> 41:02.883
You feel something else for me.
You just won't admit it.

41:04.227 --> 41:06.195
So I'm not giving up.

41:06.996 --> 41:09.123
I'm gonna fight for you

41:12.001 --> 41:14.629
until your heart stops beating.

41:15.004 --> 41:16.733
Well, then you're not gonna
have to fight for long.

41:16.806 --> 41:19.104
You're rushing into it because
you're afraid you'll change your mind.

41:19.175 --> 41:20.767
No, I'm not.

41:22.178 --> 41:23.975
I know what I want.

41:25.415 --> 41:28.441
You wouldn't have to change for me, Bella,

41:29.152 --> 41:31.347
or say goodbye to anybody.

41:32.422 --> 41:34.982
I can give you more than him.

41:35.992 --> 41:40.224
I mean, he probably can't even kiss you
without hurting you.

41:41.664 --> 41:43.029
Feel that?

41:44.033 --> 41:46.263
Flesh and blood.

41:46.903 --> 41:48.632
And warmth.

42:00.450 --> 42:01.576
God!

42:03.252 --> 42:04.480
God!

42:12.328 --> 42:13.352
Edward!

42:13.429 --> 42:15.693
If you ever touch her
against her will again...

42:15.765 --> 42:17.756
- Don't do this here!
- She's not sure what she wants.

42:17.834 --> 42:19.267
- Don't do this here!
- Let me give you a clue.

42:19.335 --> 42:20.734
Wait for her to say the words.

42:20.803 --> 42:23.067
Fine! And she will.

42:23.439 --> 42:24.838
Jacob, just go, okay?

42:24.907 --> 42:27.637
Hey, hey, hey! Easy, guys. Easy.

42:28.044 --> 42:30.706
Let's take it down a notch. All right?

42:33.950 --> 42:35.042
What's going on?

42:38.955 --> 42:39.944
I kissed Bella.

42:44.560 --> 42:45.993
And she broke her hand.

42:48.264 --> 42:49.458
Punching my face.

42:51.701 --> 42:53.066
Total misunderstanding.

42:55.705 --> 42:57.104
It's just a sprain.

42:57.273 --> 42:59.434
It should heal fairly quickly.

43:00.943 --> 43:04.379
Trying to walk and chew gum
at the same time again, Bella?

43:05.214 --> 43:06.704
I punched a werewolf in the face.

43:06.883 --> 43:10.478
Badass.
You're gonna be one tough little newborn.

43:11.621 --> 43:13.384
Tough enough to take you on.

43:19.695 --> 43:21.128
Don't worry about it.

43:24.400 --> 43:25.992
Got any leads?

43:26.369 --> 43:30.703
No sign of the intruder. But Victoria
continues to make appearances.

43:38.281 --> 43:40.806
Go blather to someone else
about the joys of becoming a newborn.

43:45.354 --> 43:46.582
Okay...

43:47.657 --> 43:49.090
Rosalie,

43:51.227 --> 43:53.923
I don't understand what I did
to make you hate me so much.

43:54.263 --> 43:55.321
Hate...

43:57.400 --> 43:58.560
I don't hate you.

44:01.737 --> 44:04.604
I don't particularly like you, but...

44:09.178 --> 44:11.271
Bella, I envy you.

44:12.281 --> 44:13.543
What?

44:14.851 --> 44:17.149
- That's ridiculous.
- No, it's not.

44:19.388 --> 44:20.855
You have a choice.

44:21.123 --> 44:22.590
I didn't.

44:23.526 --> 44:27.155
None of us did.
But you do, and you're choosing wrong.

44:28.264 --> 44:31.165
I don't care
how miserable your human life is.

44:32.034 --> 44:34.662
My life is not miserable.

44:37.840 --> 44:41.105
I mean, it's not perfect.
Nobody's life is perfect.

44:41.577 --> 44:42.976
Mine was.

44:43.679 --> 44:45.579
Absolutely perfect.

44:47.350 --> 44:49.215
There were things I still wanted,

44:50.419 --> 44:51.909
to be married, with a nice house

44:51.988 --> 44:54.183
and a husband to kiss me
when he came home,

44:54.624 --> 44:56.683
a family of my own.

44:57.627 --> 45:00.994
Royce King was the most eligible bachelor
in town.

45:02.064 --> 45:03.929
I barely knew him.

45:08.204 --> 45:12.163
But I was young.
I was in love with the idea of love.

45:13.743 --> 45:17.201
On the last night of my life,
I left a friend's house late.

45:17.280 --> 45:18.770
I wasn't far from home.

45:18.848 --> 45:20.543
There she is.

45:20.616 --> 45:21.640
Hey, Rose!

45:22.652 --> 45:25.018
Come over here! Here. Hold this.

45:25.888 --> 45:27.549
Hey, come over here.

45:28.024 --> 45:30.322
We've been waiting for you.

45:31.227 --> 45:32.888
There she is.

45:34.297 --> 45:35.992
Royce. Royce!

45:37.433 --> 45:39.196
You're drunk.

45:39.268 --> 45:42.760
Isn't she lovely, John?
I told you she was a looker.

45:42.838 --> 45:45.363
It's hard to say with all those clothes on.

45:45.775 --> 45:46.969
What do you say, Rose?

45:47.543 --> 45:49.477
- Why don't we take off a few layers?
- Stop it, stop it.

45:49.946 --> 45:51.914
Stop. Stop!

45:54.417 --> 45:55.748
I'll see you tomorrow.

45:55.818 --> 45:57.149
Sober.

45:58.688 --> 46:00.053
Hey, where do you think you're going?

46:00.122 --> 46:02.522
- I said, get... Come back... Hey!
- Stop! Stop! Get off me!

46:02.591 --> 46:04.559
- You'll do as I say!
- Let go of me! Stop!

46:04.627 --> 46:06.959
Stop! Let go! Stop!

46:09.665 --> 46:12.691
They left me in the street,
thinking I was dead.

46:13.102 --> 46:15.002
Believe me, I wanted to be.

46:16.706 --> 46:18.833
Carlisle found me. He smelled all the blood.

46:19.308 --> 46:22.106
- Thought he was helping me.
- I'm sorry.

46:24.880 --> 46:27.178
I got my revenge on them.

46:28.684 --> 46:30.345
One at a time.

46:30.753 --> 46:33.517
Saved Royce for last,
so he'd know I was coming.

46:52.108 --> 46:54.474
I was a little theatrical back then.

47:03.352 --> 47:06.253
Things got better after I found Emmett.

47:08.691 --> 47:10.852
But we'll always be this.

47:14.563 --> 47:15.757
Frozen.

47:16.899 --> 47:18.423
Never moving forward.

47:20.302 --> 47:23.897
That's what I miss the most. Possibilities.

47:25.274 --> 47:27.799
Sitting on a front porch somewhere,

47:28.044 --> 47:30.672
Emmett, gray-haired, by my side,

47:30.746 --> 47:33.374
surrounded by our grandchildren.

47:34.683 --> 47:36.412
Their laughter.

47:38.421 --> 47:41.322
I understand that that's what you want.

47:48.230 --> 47:51.131
But there's nothing
I'm ever gonna want more

47:53.869 --> 47:55.461
than Edward.

47:56.205 --> 47:58.139
You're wrong again.

47:59.975 --> 48:03.877
After you've been changed,
there's one thing you'll want more,

48:04.380 --> 48:05.711
one thing you'll kill for.

48:08.617 --> 48:09.982
Blood.

48:15.758 --> 48:18.921
What did I say about a low profile?

48:31.340 --> 48:33.240
Something's coming.

48:35.344 --> 48:39.440
Something bigger than any of us alone.

48:40.883 --> 48:45.445
And if you can't control yourselves,

48:48.257 --> 48:50.350
we're all going to die.

48:54.663 --> 48:56.961
What's done is done, just

48:59.602 --> 49:01.934
clean up after yourselves.

49:10.613 --> 49:13.639
They've already drawn too much attention.

49:13.716 --> 49:15.047
So has our inaction.

49:16.085 --> 49:19.748
Others may begin to question
the Volturi's effectiveness.

49:20.689 --> 49:22.156
Let them.

49:27.696 --> 49:29.857
Maybe we should consult with Aro.

49:34.937 --> 49:37.201
Aro's decisions are being watched.

49:39.275 --> 49:41.004
We must decide.

49:43.445 --> 49:46.642
Then decide, sister. It's time.

49:48.617 --> 49:50.380
Yes, it is.

49:55.291 --> 49:58.089
Either we let them do
what they were created for,

49:59.161 --> 50:00.958
or we end them.

50:01.897 --> 50:03.865
Decisions, decisions.

50:14.376 --> 50:18.676
When we were five, they asked us
what we wanted to be when we grew up.

50:18.747 --> 50:22.843
Our answers were things
like astronaut, president,

50:23.485 --> 50:26.181
or, in my case, a princess.

50:26.255 --> 50:28.883
When we were 10, they asked again.

50:28.958 --> 50:33.827
We answered rock star, cowboy
or, in my case, a gold medalist.

50:34.830 --> 50:38.561
But now that we've grown up,
they want a serious answer.

50:39.134 --> 50:41.125
Well, how about this?

50:41.904 --> 50:43.428
Who the hell knows?

50:44.707 --> 50:45.867
Yeah!

50:47.710 --> 50:49.905
This isn't the time to make
hard-and-fast decisions.

50:49.979 --> 50:51.640
This is the time to make mistakes.

50:52.681 --> 50:55.650
Take the wrong train
and get stuck somewhere.

50:55.718 --> 50:58.380
Fall in love a lot.

50:59.788 --> 51:03.986
Major in philosophy, because there's
no way to make a career out of that.

51:04.059 --> 51:07.893
Change your mind, and change it again,
because nothing's permanent.

51:09.064 --> 51:11.624
So make as many mistakes as you can.

51:12.101 --> 51:14.797
That way, someday,
when they ask what we want to be,

51:15.271 --> 51:16.636
we won't have to guess.

51:18.107 --> 51:19.699
We'll know.

51:47.269 --> 51:48.566
You made it!

51:49.038 --> 51:51.529
Hey. What did you think of my speech?

51:51.607 --> 51:54.576
Too easy-breezy? Too self-helpful?
You hated it?

51:54.643 --> 51:57.237
- No. I think you pretty much nailed it.
- Yeah?

51:57.546 --> 51:59.844
It's like I was born to lead, right?

51:59.915 --> 52:01.678
I love this song! Let's go.

52:26.608 --> 52:27.939
What are you doing here?

52:28.410 --> 52:30.275
You invited me, remember?

52:31.046 --> 52:34.982
Was my right hook too subtle for you?
That was me uninviting you.

52:35.818 --> 52:39.379
Look, Bella, I'm sorry about, you know,

52:40.923 --> 52:43.391
the kiss and your hand.

52:44.293 --> 52:48.423
I'd blame it on the whole inner animal thing,
but it was really just me

52:49.064 --> 52:50.759
being an ass.

52:51.533 --> 52:52.966
I'm really sorry.

52:54.603 --> 52:56.434
I brought you something.

52:56.739 --> 53:00.004
A graduation present. I made it myself.

53:00.909 --> 53:02.342
Wow.

53:02.811 --> 53:04.108
You made this?

53:05.080 --> 53:06.672
It's really pretty.

53:06.949 --> 53:08.348
Thanks.

53:23.098 --> 53:24.156
I'll be right back.

53:27.236 --> 53:30.433
- Alice, what'd you see?
- The decision's been made.

53:30.506 --> 53:32.064
What's going on?

53:32.141 --> 53:34.632
- You're not going to Seattle.
- No.

53:35.811 --> 53:37.711
They're coming here.

53:38.313 --> 53:39.905
They'll be here in four days.

53:39.982 --> 53:41.882
This could turn into a bloodbath.

53:42.050 --> 53:43.074
Who's behind it?

53:43.152 --> 53:45.620
I didn't see anyone I recognized.

53:46.221 --> 53:47.210
Maybe one.

53:48.390 --> 53:51.791
I know his face. He's local. Riley Biers.

53:52.628 --> 53:53.652
He didn't start this.

53:53.729 --> 53:55.720
Whoever did is staying out of the action.

53:56.064 --> 53:58.430
They must be playing with the blind spots
in your vision.

53:58.500 --> 54:00.468
Either way, the army is coming

54:00.536 --> 54:02.163
and there aren't enough of us
to protect the town.

54:02.237 --> 54:05.138
Hold up. What damn army?

54:05.207 --> 54:07.175
Newborns. Our kind.

54:07.409 --> 54:08.535
What are they after?

54:08.777 --> 54:10.677
They were passing around Bella's scent.

54:11.079 --> 54:12.376
A red blouse.

54:12.448 --> 54:15.815
They're after Bella?
What the hell does this mean?

54:15.884 --> 54:18.785
It means an ugly fight. With lives lost.

54:23.926 --> 54:26.121
All right. We're in.

54:26.562 --> 54:29.622
No. You'd get yourselves killed. No way.

54:30.165 --> 54:32.429
I wasn't asking for permission.

54:33.035 --> 54:34.434
Edward?

54:38.273 --> 54:39.763
It means more protection for you.

54:41.176 --> 54:45.840
Jacob, do you believe
Sam would agree to an understanding?

54:47.583 --> 54:50.211
As long as we get to kill some vampires.

54:50.285 --> 54:51.309
Jasper?

54:51.386 --> 54:53.411
They'll give us the numbers.

54:54.623 --> 54:58.616
Newborns won't know they even exist.
That'll give us an edge.

54:58.694 --> 55:00.127
We'll need to coordinate.

55:00.195 --> 55:04.029
- Carlisle, they're gonna get hurt.
- We'll all need some training.

55:04.099 --> 55:07.068
Fighting newborns requires knowledge
that Jasper has.

55:07.135 --> 55:09.228
You're welcome to join us.

55:10.572 --> 55:13.666
All right. Name the time and place.

55:13.742 --> 55:17.576
Jake, you don't know
what you're getting yourself into.

55:19.014 --> 55:20.379
Bella,

55:20.983 --> 55:22.883
this is what we do.

55:23.418 --> 55:24.749
You should be happy.

55:25.387 --> 55:28.049
Look at us, working together.

55:28.524 --> 55:32.051
You are the one who wanted us
to get along. Remember?

55:41.603 --> 55:42.831
Again!

55:55.951 --> 55:58.146
It's a graduation present.

56:17.306 --> 56:20.104
They don't trust us enough
to be in their human forms.

56:20.175 --> 56:22.302
They came. That's what matters.

56:23.579 --> 56:25.342
Will you translate?

56:30.385 --> 56:31.682
Hey, Jake.

56:37.793 --> 56:39.192
Welcome.

56:41.396 --> 56:45.196
Jasper has experience with newborns.
He'll teach us how to defeat them.

56:48.637 --> 56:50.298
They want to know
how the newborns differ from us.

56:51.807 --> 56:53.399
They're a great deal stronger than us

56:53.475 --> 56:56.342
because their own human blood
lingers in their tissues.

56:57.112 --> 57:00.206
Our kind is never more physically powerful

57:00.682 --> 57:02.877
than in our first several months of this life.

57:06.421 --> 57:10.221
Carlisle's right. That's why they are created.

57:11.593 --> 57:15.495
A newborn army doesn't need thousands
like a human army,

57:16.098 --> 57:18.692
but no human army
could stand against them.

57:20.335 --> 57:23.429
Now, the two most important things
to remember are, first,

57:23.505 --> 57:26.941
never let them get their arms around you.
They'll crush you instantly.

57:27.009 --> 57:28.567
And second,

57:29.811 --> 57:32.575
never go for the obvious kill.

57:34.082 --> 57:36.312
They'll be expecting that,

57:36.918 --> 57:39.182
and you will lose.

57:40.756 --> 57:41.984
Emmett.

57:44.159 --> 57:47.458
Even if they stick to humming

57:47.529 --> 57:49.053
Holding on a song to see them

57:49.131 --> 57:51.861
- Don't hold back.
- Not in my nature.

57:51.933 --> 57:53.958
Sick of, sick of, sick of love

57:56.138 --> 58:02.407
When you went down, the men came callin'

58:02.477 --> 58:06.709
Changing to stone as you wept from fallin'

58:06.782 --> 58:08.443
Never lose focus.

58:15.323 --> 58:19.157
When you went down, the men came callin'

58:21.363 --> 58:25.424
Changing to stone as you wept from fallin'

58:29.471 --> 58:30.802
One more thing.

58:31.673 --> 58:34.233
Never turn your back on your enemy.

58:34.309 --> 58:38.040
Singing in tones that makes things summer

58:45.787 --> 58:48.915
I got the skills

58:48.990 --> 58:54.485
I'm in love with you

58:54.563 --> 58:58.465
Everything you taught me, honey

58:58.533 --> 59:00.660
It never even mattered really

59:00.736 --> 59:06.902
This song's about my love for you

59:21.523 --> 59:23.855
Some of you are gonna get hurt.

59:26.528 --> 59:29.656
Some of you could get killed
because of me.

59:33.068 --> 59:35.866
It's gonna be 100 times worse
than this, right?

59:58.527 --> 59:59.994
Done for the day.

01:00:13.175 --> 01:00:14.472
Jasper?

01:00:17.746 --> 01:00:20.544
Are you sure
there's nothing I can do to help?

01:00:20.615 --> 01:00:24.142
Well, your presence alone, your scent,
will distract the newborns.

01:00:24.219 --> 01:00:28.246
Their hunting instinct will take over
and drive them crazy.

01:00:29.758 --> 01:00:31.851
Good. I'm glad.

01:00:33.995 --> 01:00:37.362
Hey. How do you know so much about this?

01:00:39.367 --> 01:00:43.428
I didn't have quite the same upbringing
as my adopted siblings.

01:00:49.811 --> 01:00:53.076
- Those bites are like mine.
- Battle scars.

01:00:55.417 --> 01:00:58.079
All the training
the Confederate Army gave me

01:00:58.153 --> 01:01:00.621
was useless against the newborns.

01:01:01.389 --> 01:01:04.222
Still, I never lost a fight.

01:01:10.131 --> 01:01:13.157
This happened during the Civil War?

01:01:13.235 --> 01:01:15.965
I was the youngest major
in the Texas cavalry,

01:01:16.037 --> 01:01:18.733
all without having seen any real battle.

01:01:18.807 --> 01:01:19.967
Until?

01:01:21.977 --> 01:01:23.842
Till I met a certain immortal.

01:01:24.779 --> 01:01:26.246
Maria.

01:01:31.086 --> 01:01:32.383
I was riding back to Galveston

01:01:32.454 --> 01:01:35.082
after evacuating a column
of women and children

01:01:35.924 --> 01:01:37.118
when I saw them.

01:01:38.326 --> 01:01:40.089
I immediately offered them my aid.

01:01:48.103 --> 01:01:50.571
Lovely. And an officer.

01:01:58.146 --> 01:02:02.776
You'd better do it, Maria.
I can never stop once I've started.

01:02:06.321 --> 01:02:10.052
- What's your name, soldier?
- Major Jasper Whitlock, ma'am.

01:02:11.026 --> 01:02:12.789
I hope you survive.

01:02:13.895 --> 01:02:16.523
You may be of great use to me.

01:02:22.003 --> 01:02:23.834
- Maria was creating an army?
- They were very common in the South.

01:02:26.241 --> 01:02:29.404
There were constant brutal battles
for territory.

01:02:30.045 --> 01:02:31.774
Maria won them all.

01:02:32.981 --> 01:02:37.611
She was smart, careful, and she had me.

01:02:40.388 --> 01:02:42.686
I was her second in command.

01:02:43.258 --> 01:02:46.250
My ability to control emotions
served her well.

01:02:48.063 --> 01:02:49.530
I trained her newborns,

01:02:53.101 --> 01:02:57.697
an endless occupation since she never
let them live beyond their first year.

01:03:00.475 --> 01:03:02.943
It was my job to dispose of them.

01:03:23.531 --> 01:03:25.965
I could feel everything they felt.

01:03:38.913 --> 01:03:41.677
I thought what Maria and I had was love.

01:03:43.084 --> 01:03:46.815
But I was her puppet.
She pulled the strings.

01:03:48.957 --> 01:03:50.891
I didn't know there was another way

01:03:53.294 --> 01:03:55.091
till I found Alice.

01:03:56.898 --> 01:03:59.230
Now, she'd seen me coming, of course.

01:03:59.701 --> 01:04:01.794
You kept me waiting long enough.

01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:07.435
My apologies, ma'am.

01:04:09.444 --> 01:04:11.742
I don't know what I'd have become
without her.

01:04:14.182 --> 01:04:16.582
You never have to be that again.

01:04:44.546 --> 01:04:45.604
Jasper.

01:04:46.981 --> 01:04:48.949
I want you to do something for me.

01:04:49.017 --> 01:04:51.315
Kill her.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.926
What is it?

01:05:10.572 --> 01:05:12.096
The intruder,

01:05:13.741 --> 01:05:15.402
the newborn army,

01:05:17.679 --> 01:05:19.977
they're all her puppets.

01:05:22.117 --> 01:05:23.345
Victoria.

01:05:24.552 --> 01:05:27.817
Alice would have seen
if she wanted to make an army.

01:05:27.889 --> 01:05:32.690
Unless she's hiding behind them
and she's letting someone else decide.

01:06:01.956 --> 01:06:03.821
Welcome to the army.

01:06:13.101 --> 01:06:16.798
I'm not just gonna hide
while you're out taking all the risks for me.

01:06:17.605 --> 01:06:21.006
If it's Victoria involved, I need to keep you
as far away from the fight as possible.

01:06:21.075 --> 01:06:24.533
- Jasper said that I could be of help.
- We won't need your help.

01:06:24.612 --> 01:06:27.445
With the wolves in this, it's an easy win.

01:06:27.515 --> 01:06:30.143
The rest of us
aren't gonna have enough to do.

01:06:30.218 --> 01:06:32.584
Okay.
Either it's so dangerous that I have to hide

01:06:32.654 --> 01:06:34.679
or it's so easy
that you're gonna be sidelined. Which is it?

01:06:34.756 --> 01:06:37.247
It's dangerous for you, it's easy for us.

01:06:39.194 --> 01:06:43.858
I think it's dangerous for us to be apart.
How many times do we have to prove that?

01:06:44.899 --> 01:06:49.632
I'll be worried. You'll be worried.
And we'll both be more vulnerable.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.969
Okay, you're right.

01:06:54.676 --> 01:06:58.237
- So I'm coming with you.
- No, we both stay away together.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:01.547
I can't make you choose
between me and your family.

01:07:01.616 --> 01:07:04.642
The only way I can protect you
is to be with you.

01:07:08.856 --> 01:07:12.917
You're not fighting?
What, did you pull a muscle or something?

01:07:12.994 --> 01:07:15.394
- He's doing it for me, okay?
- Whatever.

01:07:16.764 --> 01:07:17.992
Just tell me the plan.

01:07:18.933 --> 01:07:20.901
This field will give us
an advantage in battle.

01:07:20.969 --> 01:07:23.767
We need to lure the newborns
with Bella's scent,

01:07:24.505 --> 01:07:26.268
but it needs to end here.

01:07:26.341 --> 01:07:27.968
Edward and I are going to a campsite.

01:07:28.042 --> 01:07:31.375
Even if he carries me,
they'll still pick up on our scents.

01:07:31.446 --> 01:07:33.414
Your stench, however, is revolting.

01:07:33.481 --> 01:07:35.608
Dude, you really
don't wanna start comparing stinks.

01:07:35.683 --> 01:07:39.278
What he means is that your scent
will mask mine if you carry me.

01:07:40.154 --> 01:07:43.180
- Done.
- This is not a good idea.

01:07:43.258 --> 01:07:48.252
Edward, they won't want
to get anywhere near his odor.

01:07:48.529 --> 01:07:50.520
Okay. Let's just try it.

01:07:53.301 --> 01:07:55.667
- Eau de wolf coming up.
- Run.

01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:08.540
So you gonna ask me
to sit out of the fight, too?

01:08:08.616 --> 01:08:10.743
Or don't you care about my safety?

01:08:11.219 --> 01:08:16.657
- Of course, I care. But you'd say no.
- I won't have a choice, anyways.

01:08:17.892 --> 01:08:22.192
Since I let Sam be alpha male,
I gotta live with the shots he calls.

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:25.331
Since you let Sam be alpha?

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:30.401
I didn't wanna be in a pack,
let alone be its leader.

01:08:32.273 --> 01:08:33.365
Wow.

01:08:34.876 --> 01:08:37.845
- Chief Jacob.
- Opted out.

01:08:38.979 --> 01:08:41.278
But every choice has its consequences.

01:08:41.849 --> 01:08:44.408
- Some more than others.
- Don't start.

01:08:44.919 --> 01:08:47.888
Everybody makes choices.
You're gonna have to accept mine.

01:08:47.955 --> 01:08:51.356
But you can love
more than one person at a time.

01:08:51.426 --> 01:08:55.055
I've seen it. With Sam, Emily and Leah.

01:08:56.596 --> 01:09:01.533
- Well, I'm not a wolf. I can't imprint.
- It has nothing to do with imprinting.

01:09:02.703 --> 01:09:06.332
It has to do with feeling something
for somebody.

01:09:06.974 --> 01:09:09.602
And I know you feel something for me.

01:09:10.812 --> 01:09:13.939
I can sense how I make you feel, physically.

01:09:15.817 --> 01:09:17.580
I make you nervous.

01:09:21.889 --> 01:09:23.117
Jake.

01:09:25.193 --> 01:09:26.626
Don't worry.

01:09:27.562 --> 01:09:30.929
I promised I wouldn't kiss you again
till you asked.

01:09:31.566 --> 01:09:35.161
You're gonna be keeping that promise
for a while, chief.

01:09:38.171 --> 01:09:41.698
All I picked up was wolf stench. No Bella.

01:09:44.946 --> 01:09:47.380
- This will work.
- Great.

01:09:55.456 --> 01:09:57.151
Yes. Scout's honor.

01:09:57.925 --> 01:10:00.826
- Okay, Alice, don't be a stranger.
- Okay.

01:10:02.530 --> 01:10:05.522
- Your alibi for the battle is all arranged.
- Really?

01:10:06.033 --> 01:10:08.729
I told your father that our whole family's
going camping this weekend,

01:10:08.803 --> 01:10:11.237
so you and I are having a sleepover
at my house.

01:10:12.507 --> 01:10:15.340
- Charlie's going fishing, anyway.
- Charlie?

01:10:15.877 --> 01:10:19.313
- You guys are on first name basis now?
- Me, he likes.

01:10:20.882 --> 01:10:24.113
Actually, you and Edward
will have the house to yourself tonight.

01:10:27.688 --> 01:10:28.746
Like alone?

01:10:29.524 --> 01:10:33.016
We're all going hunting.
Powering up for the battle.

01:10:35.763 --> 01:10:36.855
You're welcome.

01:10:39.066 --> 01:10:42.832
- Hey. You want a sandwich?
- No, I'm good.

01:10:44.906 --> 01:10:46.897
Well, the sister, I like.

01:10:48.075 --> 01:10:50.976
Alice. Yeah, she's great.

01:10:58.953 --> 01:11:00.921
Hey, Dad, I was wondering.

01:11:02.457 --> 01:11:05.517
Why didn't you get remarried? After Mom.

01:11:09.964 --> 01:11:14.697
I don't know.
Guess I still haven't met the right gal.

01:11:17.104 --> 01:11:19.197
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:26.537
I thought you just maybe gave up
on the whole institution of it,

01:11:27.682 --> 01:11:29.115
of marriage.

01:11:30.918 --> 01:11:32.545
But do you think there's any value in it?

01:11:34.822 --> 01:11:37.848
Yeah. Yeah, marriage has value.

01:11:39.927 --> 01:11:41.519
When you're older.

01:11:42.530 --> 01:11:43.792
Much older.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.592
Like your mother.

01:11:48.002 --> 01:11:50.402
It seemed to work out fine for her
the second time around,

01:11:50.471 --> 01:11:53.372
- later in life.
- Yeah, I guess.

01:11:55.977 --> 01:12:00.311
I mean, you definitely don't wanna
have to get married because you weren't

01:12:01.382 --> 01:12:02.781
careful.

01:12:04.752 --> 01:12:08.188
- What?
- Look, you know what I'm talking about.

01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:12.821
There's things you need to think about
if you're gonna be physically intimate.

01:12:12.894 --> 01:12:15.488
Okay. Don't have "the talk" with me, please.

01:12:15.563 --> 01:12:18.123
Well, it's just as embarrassing for me
as it is for you.

01:12:18.199 --> 01:12:19.564
I doubt that.

01:12:19.634 --> 01:12:22.068
And don't bother,
'cause Mom beat you to it like 10 years ago.

01:12:22.136 --> 01:12:24.036
Well, you didn't have a boyfriend
10 years ago.

01:12:24.105 --> 01:12:26.505
I'm sure things work the same way.

01:12:28.843 --> 01:12:30.538
All right, so...

01:12:32.446 --> 01:12:34.880
You guys are taking precautions and...

01:12:34.949 --> 01:12:37.918
Okay, Dad, please,
just don't worry about that.

01:12:38.986 --> 01:12:42.012
Edward is old school.

01:12:44.358 --> 01:12:47.953
Old school. Great. What's that?
Like, code for something?

01:12:48.029 --> 01:12:50.691
Oh, my God. Dad. I'm a virgin.

01:12:51.699 --> 01:12:55.260
- Okay! Good. Glad we covered that.
- Me, too.

01:12:59.807 --> 01:13:01.138
Virgin.

01:13:02.743 --> 01:13:05.041
I'm liking Edward a little bit more now.

01:13:15.923 --> 01:13:18.153
What are you doing outside?
What's wrong?

01:13:19.427 --> 01:13:20.655
Nothing.

01:13:40.448 --> 01:13:43.246
It seems only fair
that I be represented, as well.

01:13:47.855 --> 01:13:49.686
It's really pretty.

01:13:50.891 --> 01:13:51.949
Thanks.

01:14:00.334 --> 01:14:01.824
There's a bed.

01:14:03.137 --> 01:14:05.571
I thought you might need one to sleep in.

01:14:07.908 --> 01:14:10.502
I think an air mattress would have sufficed.

01:14:10.578 --> 01:14:13.479
- Is this too much?
- No.

01:14:14.649 --> 01:14:16.344
No, it's perfect.

01:14:17.952 --> 01:14:21.388
- I wanna ask you something.
- Anything.

01:14:25.626 --> 01:14:28.959
Okay, marriage is the condition for you
to change me yourself, right?

01:14:31.866 --> 01:14:32.958
Yes.

01:14:35.936 --> 01:14:38.996
Okay. I wanna negotiate my own condition.

01:14:41.108 --> 01:14:43.440
Anything you want. It's yours.

01:14:45.479 --> 01:14:47.106
You promise?

01:14:48.549 --> 01:14:49.743
Yeah.

01:14:53.754 --> 01:14:55.085
Okay.

01:15:01.629 --> 01:15:02.687
Hey.

01:15:11.505 --> 01:15:12.802
Bella.

01:15:13.874 --> 01:15:15.068
No.

01:15:15.142 --> 01:15:17.440
But you said that you wanted me
to have every human experience.

01:15:17.511 --> 01:15:20.674
- Not ones that will risk killing you.
- You won't.

01:15:22.883 --> 01:15:25.977
And everyone says once I'm changed
all I'll want is to slaughter the whole town.

01:15:27.354 --> 01:15:30.448
- That part doesn't last forever.
- I want you.

01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:37.092
While I'm still me.
While I still want you this way.

01:15:41.836 --> 01:15:46.830
- It's too dangerous.
- Try. Just try.

01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:54.113
I'll go to some ridiculously expensive
college and let you buy me a car.

01:15:54.181 --> 01:15:56.411
I'll marry you. Just try.

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.621
You were searching

01:16:03.524 --> 01:16:07.358
For release

01:16:08.062 --> 01:16:11.498
You took my hand

01:16:11.899 --> 01:16:15.562
Added a plan

01:16:15.636 --> 01:16:19.800
You gave me your heart

01:16:26.714 --> 01:16:33.643
I know you're pleased to go

01:16:37.792 --> 01:16:40.283
Stop trying to take your clothes off.

01:16:40.361 --> 01:16:43.023
- You wanna do that part?
- Not tonight.

01:17:03.417 --> 01:17:04.577
You...

01:17:08.088 --> 01:17:10.022
You mean, you don't...

01:17:11.992 --> 01:17:13.084
That's fine.

01:17:16.497 --> 01:17:18.624
Believe me, I want to.

01:17:20.801 --> 01:17:22.735
I just want to be married to you first.

01:17:26.106 --> 01:17:28.404
You really make me feel
like I'm some sort of villain

01:17:28.475 --> 01:17:31.569
trying to steal your virtue or something.

01:17:33.981 --> 01:17:36.176
It's not my virtue I'm concerned about.

01:17:38.586 --> 01:17:40.247
Are you kidding?

01:17:40.821 --> 01:17:44.848
It's just one rule I wanna leave unbroken.

01:17:47.194 --> 01:17:50.925
It might be too late for my soul,
but I will protect yours.

01:17:52.099 --> 01:17:54.795
I know that's not a modern notion.

01:17:54.869 --> 01:17:58.032
It's not modern. It's ancient.

01:18:01.141 --> 01:18:03.200
I'm from a different era.

01:18:05.546 --> 01:18:09.073
Things were a lot less complicated.

01:18:11.318 --> 01:18:15.778
And if I'd have met you back then,
I would have courted you.

01:18:17.992 --> 01:18:23.157
We'd have taken chaperoned strolls
and iced tea on the porch.

01:18:33.974 --> 01:18:36.340
I may have stolen a kiss or two,

01:18:37.444 --> 01:18:42.381
but only after asking
your father's permission.

01:18:44.685 --> 01:18:46.243
I would have got down on one knee,

01:18:53.127 --> 01:18:56.096
and I would have
presented you with a ring.

01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:04.262
This was my mother's.

01:19:08.542 --> 01:19:13.502
Isabella Swan, I promise to love you
every moment of forever.

01:19:14.682 --> 01:19:18.345
And would you do me
the extraordinary honor of marrying me?

01:19:24.224 --> 01:19:25.589
Yes.

01:19:47.448 --> 01:19:49.541
You're not coming with us?

01:19:58.125 --> 01:20:00.616
It'll be a last minute decision.

01:20:02.629 --> 01:20:07.862
- I told you how it works.
- The Cullens have powers.

01:20:09.069 --> 01:20:13.768
Don't underestimate them, Riley.
You'll have the numbers,

01:20:14.742 --> 01:20:19.941
but they'll be able
to anticipate your every move.

01:20:21.348 --> 01:20:24.112
- According to your friend?
- Yes.

01:20:24.718 --> 01:20:27.585
My dead friend.

01:20:30.357 --> 01:20:33.622
Laurent found out about the things
they could do,

01:20:35.629 --> 01:20:37.460
and they killed him.

01:20:39.333 --> 01:20:41.528
But not before he told me.

01:20:46.673 --> 01:20:48.504
Maybe he was wrong.

01:20:51.578 --> 01:20:58.074
I mean, this is supposed to be
Cullen territory.

01:20:59.186 --> 01:21:03.122
We've been tearing it up
and I've never even seen them here.

01:21:04.158 --> 01:21:05.921
You don't trust me.

01:21:07.127 --> 01:21:11.655
- With my life. I'm just saying...
- I'm doing this for us.

01:21:11.732 --> 01:21:16.795
So that we can feed
without their retaliation.

01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:20.636
I can't live in fear anymore,
waiting for them to attack.

01:21:20.707 --> 01:21:22.402
I won't let them.

01:21:23.577 --> 01:21:28.344
I am going to end the Cullen clan.

01:21:31.218 --> 01:21:32.617
I swear.

01:21:49.803 --> 01:21:53.136
I love you so much.

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.159
You're going overboard.

01:22:15.762 --> 01:22:18.322
If this is all I can contribute,
I wanna be thorough.

01:22:18.398 --> 01:22:20.628
The newborns'll be frantic.

01:22:22.836 --> 01:22:26.237
It's okay.
Don't make yourself uncomfortable.

01:22:26.306 --> 01:22:27.637
It doesn't bother me anymore.

01:22:29.743 --> 01:22:30.937
Since when?

01:22:31.411 --> 01:22:34.437
Since I spent 24 hours
thinking you were dead.

01:22:36.083 --> 01:22:38.313
You're not wearing your ring.

01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:42.186
Well, I didn't want to risk losing it.

01:22:44.057 --> 01:22:45.547
Or risk Jacob seeing it.

01:22:48.795 --> 01:22:52.697
I think we should wait to tell him.
I mean, at least till after the fight.

01:22:52.766 --> 01:22:55.394
- If you're having second thoughts...
- I'm not.

01:22:55.469 --> 01:22:59.565
- I just want him to have a clear head.
- Whose head is unclear?

01:23:01.108 --> 01:23:02.803
Nobody's I hope.

01:23:03.810 --> 01:23:06.779
- Alice says there's a storm coming.
- Yeah, I can feel it.

01:23:08.015 --> 01:23:09.812
We should get going.

01:23:10.951 --> 01:23:13.419
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

01:23:22.696 --> 01:23:24.163
Something up?

01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:30.797
- Bunch of vampires trying to kill me.
- Same old same old.

01:24:48.782 --> 01:24:49.874
Thank you.

01:24:52.452 --> 01:24:55.512
- You should get back before the storm hits.
- No, I'm staying.

01:24:56.256 --> 01:24:58.986
You'll need my connection to the pack
to keep tabs on what's going on.

01:24:59.059 --> 01:25:02.586
- You're not gonna fight?
- Seth will spell me in the morning.

01:25:02.963 --> 01:25:05.898
He's not happy about missing the action
but it'll keep him out of trouble.

01:25:07.668 --> 01:25:09.226
Let's get you inside.

01:25:27.421 --> 01:25:32.586
- I should have chosen a site lower down.
- No, it's fine. I'm okay.

01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:34.852
What can I do?

01:25:47.607 --> 01:25:50.906
I can't sleep
with all that teeth chattering going on.

01:25:58.185 --> 01:26:02.417
- Forget it.
- She may need her toes someday.

01:26:03.690 --> 01:26:07.023
And let's face it, I am hotter than you.

01:26:12.099 --> 01:26:16.968
- Get your hand off me.
- Keep your hands off her.

01:26:17.471 --> 01:26:18.961
Don't fight.

01:26:22.342 --> 01:26:24.139
If she gets sick, it's on you.

01:26:41.194 --> 01:26:43.389
Wow, you're freezing, Bella.

01:26:44.498 --> 01:26:47.956
Relax. You'll warm up soon.

01:26:49.536 --> 01:26:52.096
Faster if you took your clothes off.

01:26:52.172 --> 01:26:54.834
- Jake.
- Survival 101.

01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:29.771
Can you at least attempt
to control your thoughts?

01:27:32.179 --> 01:27:35.774
I really get under
that ice-cold skin of yours, don't I?

01:27:38.118 --> 01:27:39.244
What?

01:27:40.287 --> 01:27:42.949
Are you doubting her feelings for you?

01:27:45.625 --> 01:27:46.717
Nice.

01:27:47.861 --> 01:27:53.197
So picking through my brain's okay,
but letting me into yours, forget it.

01:27:57.204 --> 01:27:58.364
Look.

01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:02.807
- I know she's in love with you.
- Good.

01:28:03.477 --> 01:28:05.809
But she's in love with me, too.

01:28:08.048 --> 01:28:10.573
She just won't admit it to herself.

01:28:13.587 --> 01:28:16.021
I can't tell if you're right.

01:28:17.491 --> 01:28:19.015
Then let me ask you something.

01:28:20.093 --> 01:28:22.823
- If she chooses me...
- She won't.

01:28:23.396 --> 01:28:24.727
If she did,

01:28:26.466 --> 01:28:27.865
would you try to kill me?

01:28:29.503 --> 01:28:31.596
That's an intriguing idea.

01:28:36.510 --> 01:28:39.638
But, no. I couldn't hurt her like that.

01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:43.544
So you'd just turn her into
a blood-sucking demon like you?

01:28:44.351 --> 01:28:47.252
I don't want that. I never wanted that.

01:28:47.687 --> 01:28:50.212
- So stop her.
- I tried.

01:28:52.025 --> 01:28:54.755
- I left.
- But you gave up too quickly.

01:28:56.696 --> 01:29:01.599
If you'd stayed away another 6 months,
I could've made her happy.

01:29:02.369 --> 01:29:03.700
Trust me.

01:29:05.205 --> 01:29:10.040
You have to consider
that I might be better for her than you are.

01:29:12.712 --> 01:29:14.646
I have considered that.

01:29:18.351 --> 01:29:20.512
I know you can protect her.

01:29:23.156 --> 01:29:27.991
But you can give her a life, a human life.
That's all I want for her.

01:29:31.164 --> 01:29:32.222
But I'm not...

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:36.565
I'm not going to force her into anything
ever again.

01:29:39.005 --> 01:29:42.338
The last time I tried,
it almost killed us both.

01:29:44.678 --> 01:29:47.078
Yeah. That I remember.

01:29:51.318 --> 01:29:53.582
When you thought she was gone,

01:29:55.922 --> 01:29:57.685
that you'd lost her,

01:30:00.193 --> 01:30:03.094
how did you cope?

01:30:05.098 --> 01:30:06.895
There are no words.

01:30:12.939 --> 01:30:15.373
But I wouldn't wish it on anyone, Jacob.

01:30:18.111 --> 01:30:21.638
This might sound odd,
but I'm glad you're here.

01:30:22.515 --> 01:30:23.812
Meaning,

01:30:24.851 --> 01:30:27.820
"As much as I'd love to kill you,
I'm glad she's warm."

01:30:30.957 --> 01:30:33.255
If we weren't natural enemies

01:30:33.793 --> 01:30:36.728
and you weren't trying to
steal my reason for existing,

01:30:38.098 --> 01:30:40.225
I might actually like you.

01:30:41.267 --> 01:30:42.564
Well,

01:30:44.137 --> 01:30:48.335
if you weren't planning on sucking the life
out of the girl I love,

01:30:49.242 --> 01:30:50.573
I might...

01:30:57.651 --> 01:31:00.711
No. Not even then.

01:31:09.062 --> 01:31:12.361
But she could still change her mind,
you know.

01:31:19.139 --> 01:31:20.504
Then I'd let her go.

01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:42.252
Right. Hey, Seth.

01:31:45.465 --> 01:31:48.400
- Where's Jacob? Did he already...
- Not yet.

01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:54.036
He's checking to see if the woods are clear
before he goes.

01:32:01.147 --> 01:32:04.708
I'm really sorry about last night.
That couldn't have been easy on you.

01:32:05.151 --> 01:32:08.143
It definitely won't make my list
of top 10 favorite evenings.

01:32:09.222 --> 01:32:13.352
- You have a list?
- All 10 I spent with you.

01:32:14.794 --> 01:32:19.163
Number one is when you said
you'd marry me, Mrs. Cullen.

01:32:23.002 --> 01:32:26.904
This is the 21st century.
I at least want to hyphenate my name.

01:32:27.741 --> 01:32:31.199
- You're marrying him?
- Jake, I...

01:32:35.582 --> 01:32:39.040
- You knew he was listening!
- He deserves to know.

01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:41.978
- Jake, stop!
- Bella, let him...

01:32:42.088 --> 01:32:43.214
Don't!

01:32:46.292 --> 01:32:47.350
Jake, stop!

01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:54.488
- Jake, please!
- I'm done! I'm so done!

01:32:55.735 --> 01:32:56.963
What can I do?

01:32:57.036 --> 01:33:01.234
You can't do anything. I can,
by going out there and killing something.

01:33:01.307 --> 01:33:03.901
No! You're not thinking clearly!
Don't do that!

01:33:04.110 --> 01:33:06.772
Maybe I'll get myself killed
and make it simple for you.

01:33:06.846 --> 01:33:09.280
No! Just, Jake, stay.

01:33:11.184 --> 01:33:12.378
Why?

01:33:14.254 --> 01:33:15.949
Give me one good reason.

01:33:17.090 --> 01:33:19.024
Because I don't wanna lose you.

01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:22.025
It's not good enough.

01:33:23.429 --> 01:33:25.294
Because you're too important.

01:33:28.735 --> 01:33:32.227
- Still not good enough.
- Jacob!

01:33:36.476 --> 01:33:37.738
Kiss me.

01:33:41.114 --> 01:33:44.572
I'm asking you to kiss me.

01:34:32.365 --> 01:34:34.993
That should have been our first kiss.

01:34:40.607 --> 01:34:42.006
I gotta go.

01:34:44.944 --> 01:34:46.343
I'll be back.

01:35:16.576 --> 01:35:19.977
- You saw.
- No, but...

01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:22.743
Jacob's thoughts are pretty loud.

01:35:24.284 --> 01:35:25.808
I don't know what happened.

01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:29.253
You love him.

01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:35.457
I love you more.

01:35:37.196 --> 01:35:38.561
I know.

01:35:53.246 --> 01:35:54.975
It's starting.

01:36:54.907 --> 01:36:56.135
Jacob just got there.

01:37:02.582 --> 01:37:04.106
He's good.

01:38:02.408 --> 01:38:03.534
Someone's hurt?

01:38:04.944 --> 01:38:07.970
She's close. I can hear her thoughts.

01:38:08.381 --> 01:38:09.609
Seth, go.

01:38:14.587 --> 01:38:16.953
She knew we weren't there,
but she caught my scent.

01:38:17.423 --> 01:38:19.516
She knew you'd be with me.

01:38:20.159 --> 01:38:21.626
She found us.

01:38:25.231 --> 01:38:26.892
She's not alone.

01:38:36.042 --> 01:38:38.840
Riley, listen to me.

01:38:40.279 --> 01:38:43.339
Victoria's just using you to distract me.

01:38:44.117 --> 01:38:45.584
She knows I'll kill you.

01:38:49.255 --> 01:38:53.021
In fact, she'll be glad
she doesn't have to deal with you anymore.

01:38:53.693 --> 01:38:58.062
Don't listen, Riley.
I told you about their mind tricks.

01:38:58.131 --> 01:39:01.965
I can read her mind.
So I know what she thinks of you.

01:39:02.468 --> 01:39:04.129
He's lying.

01:39:04.203 --> 01:39:08.867
She only created you and this army
to avenge her true mate, James.

01:39:10.042 --> 01:39:13.170
That's the only thing she cares about.
Not you.

01:39:15.815 --> 01:39:19.273
There's only you. You know that.

01:39:21.687 --> 01:39:25.350
Think about it. You're from Forks.

01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:28.420
You know the area.

01:39:29.529 --> 01:39:31.394
That's the only reason she chose you.

01:39:33.099 --> 01:39:35.329
She doesn't love you.

01:39:35.401 --> 01:39:40.395
Riley. Don't let him do this to us.

01:39:42.842 --> 01:39:44.309
You know I love you.

01:39:58.491 --> 01:39:59.890
You're dead.

01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:16.940
You won't get another chance
like this again.

01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:22.770
You want her.

01:40:24.584 --> 01:40:27.815
You want me to feel the pain you felt
when I killed James,

01:40:29.956 --> 01:40:32.618
when I tore him to pieces,

01:40:35.127 --> 01:40:37.823
when I turned him into ash,

01:40:39.999 --> 01:40:43.958
when I turned him into nothing.

01:42:04.083 --> 01:42:05.243
Victoria!

01:42:06.686 --> 01:42:07.880
Victoria!

01:42:08.754 --> 01:42:10.346
Victoria!

01:43:04.477 --> 01:43:07.412
- Something is wrong.
- Alice needs us to go.

01:43:08.347 --> 01:43:09.439
Now.

01:43:32.471 --> 01:43:35.531
- How long?
- A few minutes. Maybe 10?

01:43:35.608 --> 01:43:36.973
The pack needs to leave.

01:43:37.042 --> 01:43:39.533
The Volturi won't honor
a truce with the werewolves.

01:43:46.519 --> 01:43:47.577
Leah, don't!

01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:06.565
Jacob!

01:44:09.942 --> 01:44:12.502
Jacob. Hold on.
Carlisle's gonna take care of you.

01:44:12.578 --> 01:44:14.739
The bones on the right half of his body
are shattered.

01:44:16.482 --> 01:44:18.848
- Bella.
- Jake, I'm right here.

01:44:20.853 --> 01:44:23.117
- Jacob, you idiot, I had it!
- Leah!

01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:25.851
I need to set the bones
before his accelerated healing kicks in.

01:44:25.925 --> 01:44:28.223
- It's already starting.
- We need to get him out of here.

01:44:28.294 --> 01:44:31.161
We're not gonna win a fight
with the Volturi.

01:44:31.230 --> 01:44:33.960
- We'll take him back to Billy's.
- I'll be there soon as I can.

01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:35.558
Hang in there, Jake.

01:44:46.312 --> 01:44:49.076
- It's okay. We got you.
- We got you.

01:44:50.049 --> 01:44:51.175
They're coming.

01:45:12.738 --> 01:45:14.000
Impressive.

01:45:14.073 --> 01:45:18.635
I've never seen a coven escape
an assault of this magnitude intact.

01:45:18.711 --> 01:45:20.269
We were lucky.

01:45:21.747 --> 01:45:23.339
I doubt that.

01:45:25.251 --> 01:45:28.709
- It appears we missed an entertaining fight.
- Yes.

01:45:29.455 --> 01:45:32.117
It's not often we're rendered unnecessary.

01:45:32.191 --> 01:45:34.989
If you'd arrived a half hour ago,
you would have fulfilled your purpose.

01:45:36.662 --> 01:45:37.822
Pity.

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.058
You missed one.

01:45:50.109 --> 01:45:52.543
We offered her asylum
in exchange for her surrender.

01:45:53.846 --> 01:45:55.609
That wasn't yours to offer.

01:45:58.751 --> 01:45:59.877
Why did you come?

01:46:06.225 --> 01:46:07.453
Who created you?

01:46:09.295 --> 01:46:11.855
You don't need to do that.
She'll tell you anything you want to know.

01:46:12.765 --> 01:46:14.027
I know.

01:46:16.135 --> 01:46:20.003
I don't know! Riley wouldn't tell us.

01:46:21.106 --> 01:46:23.165
He said our thoughts weren't safe.

01:46:23.242 --> 01:46:26.507
Her name was Victoria.
Perhaps you knew her.

01:46:27.413 --> 01:46:30.678
Edward,
if the Volturi had knowledge of Victoria,

01:46:30.749 --> 01:46:31.738
they would have stopped her.

01:46:33.285 --> 01:46:34.582
Isn't that right, Jane?

01:46:36.989 --> 01:46:38.479
Of course.

01:46:39.959 --> 01:46:41.017
Felix.

01:46:42.328 --> 01:46:43.761
She didn't know what she was doing.

01:46:45.698 --> 01:46:48.030
We'll take responsibility for her.

01:46:48.601 --> 01:46:50.228
Give her a chance.

01:46:53.038 --> 01:46:58.237
The Volturi don't give second chances.
Keep that in mind.

01:46:59.511 --> 01:47:02.378
Caius will be interested to know
that she's still human.

01:47:02.748 --> 01:47:04.841
The date is set.

01:47:07.219 --> 01:47:10.882
Take care of that, Felix. I'd like to go home.

01:47:39.118 --> 01:47:40.608
Hey.

01:47:46.392 --> 01:47:49.884
- It's been going on for a while.
- Doc's re-breaking his bones.

01:47:49.962 --> 01:47:51.793
Why did he have to butt in?
I could've taken that tick.

01:47:51.864 --> 01:47:53.388
Give it a rest, Leah.

01:47:59.972 --> 01:48:01.803
The worst is over. He'll be all right.

01:48:02.841 --> 01:48:04.001
I gave him some morphine,

01:48:04.076 --> 01:48:06.408
but his body temperature
will burn it off soon.

01:48:06.478 --> 01:48:08.537
I'll come back to set up a drip.

01:48:09.081 --> 01:48:10.514
Thank you.

01:48:20.459 --> 01:48:21.653
He's asking for you.

01:48:36.975 --> 01:48:38.033
Hey, Jake.

01:48:41.613 --> 01:48:42.875
Hey.

01:48:55.761 --> 01:48:59.561
- I was worried about you.
- You were worried about me?

01:49:01.333 --> 01:49:02.925
Yeah.

01:49:03.936 --> 01:49:06.734
I guessed Edward would read my thoughts.

01:49:09.408 --> 01:49:12.866
- Was he hard on you?
- He wasn't even mad at me.

01:49:14.113 --> 01:49:15.273
Or you.

01:49:16.782 --> 01:49:18.272
Well, damn.

01:49:20.786 --> 01:49:24.745
- He's better than I thought.
- He's not playing a game.

01:49:27.292 --> 01:49:28.554
Right.

01:49:32.097 --> 01:49:33.394
Bella.

01:49:36.702 --> 01:49:39.535
He's not as perfect as you think.

01:49:43.075 --> 01:49:44.770
I know who he is.

01:49:49.114 --> 01:49:51.514
Can we just not talk about that?

01:49:52.718 --> 01:49:55.778
I'd rather get all the re-breaking done
at once.

01:50:01.894 --> 01:50:04.727
Well, at least I know
I did everything I could.

01:50:08.567 --> 01:50:11.900
It wasn't easy making you admit
your feelings for me.

01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:18.366
I only fought them because I knew
they wouldn't change anything.

01:50:26.585 --> 01:50:29.520
I'm exactly right for you, Bella.

01:50:32.024 --> 01:50:36.688
It would be as easy as breathing, with me.

01:50:42.701 --> 01:50:44.999
You know I love you.

01:50:51.777 --> 01:50:54.678
You know how much I wish it was enough.

01:51:06.558 --> 01:51:07.718
Should I come back?

01:51:10.929 --> 01:51:12.624
I need some time.

01:51:17.336 --> 01:51:19.429
But I'll always be waiting.

01:51:24.676 --> 01:51:27.474
Until my heart stops beating.

01:51:29.448 --> 01:51:30.779
Maybe even then.

01:51:53.872 --> 01:51:58.172
- August 13th?
- Yeah. It's a month before my birthday.

01:51:58.777 --> 01:52:01.871
I don't need to be
another year older than you.

01:52:02.681 --> 01:52:04.478
Alice said she could get the wedding
together by then.

01:52:05.584 --> 01:52:07.279
I'm sure she can.

01:52:09.655 --> 01:52:11.316
There's no rush.

01:52:13.892 --> 01:52:17.089
I've chosen my life.
I want to start living it.

01:52:18.063 --> 01:52:21.521
And so you're gonna let Alice
plan the whole thing?

01:52:21.867 --> 01:52:26.361
The dress, the reception, the guest list.

01:52:26.438 --> 01:52:29.236
I mean, who knows who she's gonna invite?

01:52:31.243 --> 01:52:32.801
Does it matter?

01:52:37.416 --> 01:52:39.350
I just don't know why you're doing this.

01:52:39.418 --> 01:52:42.615
- What? The wedding?
- No.

01:52:45.590 --> 01:52:48.423
You're trying to make everyone else happy,

01:52:49.361 --> 01:52:51.921
but you're already giving away too much.

01:52:52.864 --> 01:52:54.354
You're wrong.

01:53:02.374 --> 01:53:05.741
This wasn't a choice
between you and Jacob.

01:53:09.581 --> 01:53:13.677
It was between who I should be
and who I am.

01:53:17.389 --> 01:53:22.383
I've always felt out of step,
like literally stumbling through my life.

01:53:25.564 --> 01:53:27.464
I've never felt normal.

01:53:30.002 --> 01:53:31.936
Because I'm not normal.

01:53:33.171 --> 01:53:34.832
I don't want to be.

01:53:36.341 --> 01:53:41.574
I've had to face death and loss and pain

01:53:42.948 --> 01:53:46.111
in your world,
but I've also never felt stronger

01:53:48.787 --> 01:53:52.120
and more real, more myself.

01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:57.021
Because it's my world, too.

01:54:00.265 --> 01:54:02.028
It's where I belong.

01:54:08.874 --> 01:54:11.035
So it's not just about me?

01:54:13.278 --> 01:54:16.304
No. Sorry.

01:54:18.683 --> 01:54:23.746
I've made a mess trying to figure
all this out, but I wanna do it right.

01:54:25.123 --> 01:54:29.526
And I wanna tie myself to you
in every way humanly possible.

01:54:33.865 --> 01:54:35.423
Starting with a wedding.

01:54:39.704 --> 01:54:41.103
Actually,

01:54:42.007 --> 01:54:46.967
something a little more difficult first.
And maybe even dangerous.

01:54:52.717 --> 01:54:54.150
We have to tell Charlie.

01:54:58.323 --> 01:54:59.585
It's highly dangerous.

01:55:00.659 --> 01:55:02.820
It's a good thing you're bulletproof.

01:55:04.896 --> 01:55:06.420
I'm gonna need that ring.

01:55:31.056 --> 01:55:33.650
All the lives

01:55:34.993 --> 01:55:38.895
Always tempted to trade

01:55:42.334 --> 01:55:44.825
Will they hate me

01:55:44.903 --> 01:55:49.465
For all the choices I've made

01:55:53.345 --> 01:55:59.284
Will they stop when they see me again?

01:56:01.086 --> 01:56:06.649
I can't stop now I know who I am

01:56:09.194 --> 01:56:15.190
Now I'm all yours

01:56:15.267 --> 01:56:18.395
I'm not afraid

01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:22.873
I'm yours always

01:56:22.941 --> 01:56:26.001
Say what they may

01:56:26.077 --> 01:56:29.672
And all your love

01:56:29.748 --> 01:56:33.582
I'll take to a grave

01:56:33.652 --> 01:56:37.179
And all my life

01:56:37.255 --> 01:56:42.352
Starts now

01:56:42.427 --> 01:56:44.258
Tear me down

01:56:44.329 --> 01:56:49.790
They can take you out of my thoughts

01:56:53.572 --> 01:56:57.474
Under every scar

01:56:57.542 --> 01:57:01.478
There's a battle I've lost

01:57:04.482 --> 01:57:10.250
Will they stop when they see us again?

01:57:12.257 --> 01:57:17.957
I can't stop now I know who I am

01:57:20.232 --> 01:57:26.432
Now I'm all yours

01:57:26.504 --> 01:57:30.065
I'm not afraid

01:57:30.141 --> 01:57:34.043
I'm yours always

01:57:34.112 --> 01:57:37.275
Say what they may

01:57:37.349 --> 01:57:40.944
And all your love

01:57:41.019 --> 01:57:44.819
I'll take to a grave

01:57:44.889 --> 01:57:51.795
And all my life starts

01:57:52.597 --> 01:57:58.194
I'm all yours

01:57:58.270 --> 01:58:01.671
I'm not afraid

01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:05.801
I'm yours always

01:58:05.877 --> 01:58:09.176
Say what they may

01:58:09.247 --> 01:58:12.910
And all your love

01:58:12.984 --> 01:58:16.715
I'll take to a grave

01:58:16.788 --> 01:58:23.523
And all my life starts

01:58:27.399 --> 01:58:30.197
Starts now

01:58:43.248 --> 01:58:46.342
I was a heavy heart to carry

01:58:46.418 --> 01:58:49.319
My beloved was weighed down

01:58:49.387 --> 01:58:52.288
My arms around his neck

01:58:52.357 --> 01:58:55.087
My fingers laced a crown

01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:58.061
I was a heavy heart to carry

01:58:58.129 --> 01:59:00.893
My feet dragged across the ground

01:59:00.965 --> 01:59:03.900
And he took me to the river

01:59:03.968 --> 01:59:06.960
Where he slowly let me drown

01:59:07.038 --> 01:59:09.905
My love has concrete feet

01:59:09.974 --> 01:59:13.466
My love's an iron ball

01:59:13.545 --> 01:59:15.911
Wrapped around your ankles

01:59:15.980 --> 01:59:20.383
Over the waterfall

01:59:21.252 --> 01:59:24.653
I'm so heavy

01:59:25.557 --> 01:59:27.184
Heavy

01:59:27.258 --> 01:59:30.056
Heavy in your arms

01:59:33.064 --> 01:59:37.558
I'm so heavy

01:59:37.635 --> 01:59:39.227
Heavy

01:59:39.304 --> 01:59:42.865
Heavy in your arms

01:59:46.478 --> 01:59:49.538
And is it worth the wait

01:59:49.614 --> 01:59:51.809
All this killing time?

01:59:51.916 --> 01:59:54.783
Are you strong enough to stand

01:59:54.853 --> 01:59:58.516
Protecting both your heart and mine?

01:59:58.590 --> 02:00:00.785
Who is the betrayer?

02:00:00.859 --> 02:00:04.556
Who's the killer in the crowd?

02:00:04.629 --> 02:00:07.393
The one who creeps in corridors

02:00:07.465 --> 02:00:09.933
And doesn't make a sound

02:00:10.001 --> 02:00:12.902
My love has concrete feet

02:00:12.971 --> 02:00:16.532
My love is an iron ball

02:00:16.608 --> 02:00:18.940
Wrapped around your ankles

02:00:19.010 --> 02:00:21.945
Over the waterfall

02:00:22.013 --> 02:00:24.982
My love has concrete feet

02:00:25.049 --> 02:00:28.507
My love's an iron ball

02:00:28.586 --> 02:00:31.077
Wrapped around your ankles

02:00:31.156 --> 02:00:34.648
Over the waterfall

02:00:36.227 --> 02:00:40.459
I'm so heavy

02:00:40.532 --> 02:00:42.124
Heavy

02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:45.226
Heavy in your arms

02:00:48.072 --> 02:00:52.475
I'm so heavy

02:00:52.544 --> 02:00:54.136
Heavy

02:00:54.212 --> 02:00:58.581
Heavy in your arms

02:01:00.852 --> 02:01:03.878
I was a heavy heart to carry

02:01:03.955 --> 02:01:07.356
My beloved was weighed down

02:01:07.425 --> 02:01:10.121
My arms around his neck

02:01:10.195 --> 02:01:13.062
My fingers laced a crown

02:01:13.131 --> 02:01:15.827
I was a heavy heart to carry

02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:18.698
But he never let me down

02:01:18.770 --> 02:01:21.705
When he held me in his arms

02:01:21.773 --> 02:01:24.742
My feet never touched the ground

02:01:24.809 --> 02:01:26.970
I'm so heavy

02:01:29.447 --> 02:01:33.941
I'm so heavy in your arms

02:01:47.799 --> 02:01:50.461
Run, run, run away

02:01:50.535 --> 02:01:52.969
So lost, lost

02:01:53.037 --> 02:01:54.129
Never comin'

02:01:54.205 --> 02:01:57.868
Home rollin', rollin' down a track

02:01:57.942 --> 02:02:01.139
No, no, I'm never comin' back

02:02:01.246 --> 02:02:04.545
Hot love pumpin' in my veins

02:02:04.616 --> 02:02:08.074
Our love, I hope it's not too late

02:02:08.152 --> 02:02:09.847
That's the road, that's the load

02:02:09.921 --> 02:02:10.945
That's the role

02:02:11.022 --> 02:02:12.319
I've been down, I've been down

02:02:12.390 --> 02:02:13.789
I've been down

02:02:14.893 --> 02:02:17.828
What part of forever

02:02:17.896 --> 02:02:20.831
Don't you understand?

02:02:20.899 --> 02:02:23.493
I could stay, stay, stay

02:02:23.568 --> 02:02:26.628
If that's what you want, want, want

02:02:26.704 --> 02:02:30.003
I'd give it to you, you, you

02:02:30.074 --> 02:02:33.475
If I had a heart, heart, heart

02:02:33.545 --> 02:02:36.708
And we could go, go, go

02:02:36.814 --> 02:02:39.282
And never look back on now

02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:42.615
I'd give it to you, you, you

02:02:42.687 --> 02:02:46.521
If I had a heart

02:02:50.094 --> 02:02:53.928
Imagine eternity

02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:59.896
Doesn't seem that hard

02:03:01.839 --> 02:03:06.640
They say nothing lasts forever

02:03:08.913 --> 02:03:13.714
We'll have to prove them wrong

02:03:13.785 --> 02:03:16.345
I could stay, stay, stay

02:03:16.421 --> 02:03:19.447
If that's what you want, want, want

02:03:19.524 --> 02:03:22.721
I'd give it to you, you, you

02:03:22.827 --> 02:03:26.661
If I had a heart

02:03:26.731 --> 02:03:29.427
And we could go, go, go

02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:33.061
And never look back on now

02:03:33.137 --> 02:03:36.402
I'd give it to you, you, you

02:03:36.474 --> 02:03:40.410
If I had a heart

02:03:41.305 --> 02:03:47.706
