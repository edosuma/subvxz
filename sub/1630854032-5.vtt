WEBVTT

00:06.673 --> 00:08.758
Now that was some fantastic chow mein

00:08.842 --> 00:12.220
and before you say that sounded racist,
you can ask the waiter how they say it.

00:12.303 --> 00:14.723
It's Panda Express, honey.
The waiter’s from Portland.

00:15.056 --> 00:17.684
Alright who the hell changed my ringtone
to the theme from Taxi?

00:19.060 --> 00:20.311
It's a new thing on Taxi Tok,

00:20.395 --> 00:23.648
that's a subculture on TikTok of kids
who decided the theme from Taxi slaps.

00:23.732 --> 00:26.484
Now you have to play the Taxi theme
for ten people while I film it.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.153
I don't have to do shit, that's dumb.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.364
It raises awareness for leukemia.

00:31.448 --> 00:34.617
So. Who else is excited
for the zoo tomorrow?

00:34.701 --> 00:37.203
Zoos are my favorite kind
of non-water park.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.289
It's just a shame that they both
give you diarrhea.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.332
You only get diarrhea at the zoo

00:41.416 --> 00:43.626
if you eat the food you're supposed
to feed to the animals.

00:43.710 --> 00:47.046
-Which you've done, twice.
-They put it in gumball machines.

00:47.630 --> 00:50.675
You know Fortune Cookies only come true
if you eat the cookie first.

00:51.509 --> 00:55.346
Alright. ''Hard work often pays off?''
Lame.

00:55.430 --> 00:58.224
''Family time is time well spent.''

00:58.308 --> 01:00.351
OK, that's not only empty,
it's been disproven.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.687
OK, mine says,
''Family time is time well...''

01:02.771 --> 01:04.189
Man I got the same one.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.568
What's your stupid twenty first century
watered down fortune cookie say, Dad?

01:08.651 --> 01:10.945
''You will have sex with your mother.''

01:47.899 --> 01:49.567
Fortune cookies aren't legitimate, right?

01:49.901 --> 01:53.238
Jerry, are you seriously asking if I think
you're gonna have sex with your mom?

01:53.321 --> 01:58.243
No, I wanted to ask if it's okay with you
if I make myself throw up the cookie.

01:58.326 --> 02:01.162
If it makes you feel better
and you can do it quietly, yes,

02:01.246 --> 02:02.997
but don't hand that advice down to Summer.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.379
Can't do it. Sleepy Gary ruined
my Gag reflex,

02:09.462 --> 02:11.965
which is frustrating because
Sleepy Gary wasn't real.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.676
Neither are fortune cookies.
Go to sleep, Jerry.

02:14.759 --> 02:18.429
I know they're not real.
It’s just, why is it so specific?

02:18.513 --> 02:21.558
And why are three of the numbers
a few numbers off from my Mom's birthday?

02:21.641 --> 02:24.435
-Can we investigate this, Rick?
-It’s not an X-file, Jerry,

02:24.519 --> 02:26.563
you got the world's last
interesting fortune

02:26.646 --> 02:29.315
Dad, can you explain to TikTok
what's going on with your mom?

02:29.399 --> 02:31.985
Summer, no social videoing.
What if Mi-Maw sees it?

02:32.068 --> 02:34.279
We can't let her know
this is a thing that might happen.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.156
-Might?
-She's calling again.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.702
-She doesn't usually call this much.
-Because you don't usually ghost her

02:40.785 --> 02:43.371
because you don't usually decide
you’re at risk of...

02:43.830 --> 02:45.665
What if she's calling me
to tell me I'm adopted?

02:45.748 --> 02:47.667
Well, yeah, then you should
definitely hit that.

02:49.168 --> 02:51.921
-That's not funny!
-Jerry, you're making it funny

02:52.005 --> 02:54.549
by taking it seriously.
And none of us will be laughing

02:54.632 --> 02:56.175
if you let this ruin our zoo trip.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.260
Rick. Can you use science

02:57.343 --> 03:00.054
-to make it impossible for me to...
-Jerry, you're insulting science.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.390
And as the most powerful man
in the universe,

03:02.473 --> 03:04.684
if I create technology to prevent
a random occurrence,

03:04.767 --> 03:06.978
I'll end up making it
more possible than random.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.066
-When do we leave for the zoo?
-One hour.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.570
-You have one hour to let go of this.
-I'm already done thinking about it.

03:21.576 --> 03:22.952
Check that out.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.415
No!

03:33.546 --> 03:35.173
Let me out! Let me out!

03:36.799 --> 03:39.093
-You have ten seconds.
-I want to go.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.511
You know of my love for the zoo.

03:40.595 --> 03:43.723
-Why are you dressed like Morty?
-Because Morty's mom is Beth.

03:44.098 --> 03:45.141
I'm not unpacking that.

03:45.767 --> 03:49.187
Okay, if you think I have this much
patience for the zoo, on Earth,

03:49.270 --> 03:51.731
-you're sorely mistaken.
-Jerry, if you don't come with us

03:51.814 --> 03:53.232
I will be so disappointed

03:53.316 --> 03:56.110
You guys should probably go on
without Jerry. I just took some readings

03:56.194 --> 03:58.988
on his probability field and this fortune
has some strange powers

03:59.072 --> 04:01.658
-I'm gonna need to investigate.
-Really? God, I knew it.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.993
Okay. Well. Be careful, honey.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.495
Bring me back a handful
of zebra snacks?

04:05.578 --> 04:09.040
And please take pictures with
my favorite animal, the white tiger.

04:09.123 --> 04:11.292
-Because they breed via incest?
-Is that true?

04:14.754 --> 04:17.298
-I knew I was right.
-Not even close.

04:17.382 --> 04:20.009
I just didn't want to see someone
get bullied into going to a zoo.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.220
You may be the single dumbest
human I've ever met, Jerry,

04:22.303 --> 04:25.306
but you still have a right to take
whatever you want seriously.

04:25.390 --> 04:28.142
Thank you. But if that thing says
I'm not gonna do it with my mom,

04:28.226 --> 04:29.143
I can go to the zoo.

04:29.227 --> 04:31.980
Jerry, this thing measures
aberrations in probability waves,

04:32.063 --> 04:34.315
I didn't even bother to turn it on
because if I did...

04:36.234 --> 04:38.403
-What?
-Nothing. Don't get weird on me.

04:38.486 --> 04:41.739
But, since we're free for the afternoon,
you mind doing a quick activity?

04:42.281 --> 04:44.409
We're gonna disprove this
with efficient brute force.

04:44.492 --> 04:47.286
These are two shoeboxes, both are empty
but I wrote your mother's name

04:47.370 --> 04:50.289
-on the inside of one.
-What? God no. If you think for a second

04:50.373 --> 04:52.542
-I'm gonna put my...
-Good, I didn't wanna do this anyway.

04:53.167 --> 04:56.421
Fine! Can I just tell you which box
I would put my penis in?

04:56.504 --> 04:59.340
Saying it seems worse, but okay.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.260
Alright. I would put my penis
in the box on the right.

05:02.343 --> 05:05.596
Great, look in the other direction
and I'm gonna switch up the boxes.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.474
-This feels really low-tech.
-Yeah, cause we're measuring reality.

05:11.019 --> 05:14.480
I would take out my penis and place
it in the box on the right.

05:14.564 --> 05:15.481
Again.

05:17.358 --> 05:19.110
-I would put my penis...
-Jerry, you don't have

05:19.193 --> 05:21.320
to say penis every time,
just left or right

05:21.404 --> 05:24.282
-This was your idea.
-I didn't think it'd go on this long.

05:24.365 --> 05:27.702
-Okay, penis, Left.
-Keep going.

05:28.703 --> 05:29.620
Right.

05:30.371 --> 05:31.289
Left.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.584
-Right.
-Jerry are you fucking peeking?

05:34.667 --> 05:37.045
Tell me what's going on.
You're scaring me.

05:39.714 --> 05:42.592
Okay, I'm just as likely to shit a balloon
as I am to become a dolphin.

05:42.675 --> 05:43.968
Those are things that could happen?

05:44.052 --> 05:46.054
Jerry, everything is as likely
as anything else.

05:47.722 --> 05:50.308
Which is why it's weird
that you're at all likely to...

05:50.391 --> 05:51.726
To what? To what?

05:52.060 --> 05:54.520
Jerry, has your mother
been leaving messages?

05:54.604 --> 05:57.982
-Three texts. I'm afraid to read them.
-Read them.

05:58.733 --> 06:02.236
She's asking if she can come visit.
Why would she want that?

06:02.320 --> 06:05.198
Jerry, I'm gonna tell you something
I've never told anyone.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.658
We need to go to Panda Express.

06:08.743 --> 06:11.537
If these guys wanted my respect, they
could've just gotten a liquor license.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.498
Now you think this
has something to do with you?

06:13.581 --> 06:16.292
Jerry, whoever's behind that fortune
has, like, god powers.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.002
Of course it has something to do with me,

06:18.086 --> 06:20.463
what do you think I am in this story,
the father-in-law?

06:25.468 --> 06:27.011
You guys wanted my attention?

06:29.472 --> 06:31.140
Okay, well, now I'm getting mixed signals.

06:33.142 --> 06:36.479
Stay here, Jerry, time to kick ass.
Gonna need a soundtrack.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.689
Ship! Favorites playlist, track one!

06:43.111 --> 06:44.529
Alright, fine, no wrong answers.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.381
Tell me where you get
your cookies at and we can

07:03.464 --> 07:06.259
-all walk out of here alive! DEA?
-Fuck you, DEA piece of shit! Cookies?

07:06.342 --> 07:08.302
-Fortune cookies.
-You're not here about our gang's

07:08.386 --> 07:09.595
-city-wide meth ring?
-What? No.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.681
Break the laws,
they shouldn't exist anyway.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.060
-I am embarrassed.
-Me too.

07:16.519 --> 07:20.106
-Sorry about these dead guys.
-Comes with the territory.

07:20.189 --> 07:23.568
-So where do you get your cookies?
-Same distributor as everyone else.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.361
-That's their truck out back.
-Solid.

07:25.444 --> 07:28.030
OK, I'm gonna take the truck
in exchange for not turning you in.

07:34.787 --> 07:38.583
Jeez, how much money can there be
in cookies that you get for free?

07:38.666 --> 07:43.045
And now we're being retina scanned?
I know! I've got a theory, Jerry.

07:43.129 --> 07:46.257
-Good.
-This place is run by Cookie Monster.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.968
He's really protective about his cookies.

07:49.343 --> 07:50.720
C'mon man you can't crack a smile?

07:51.220 --> 07:53.723
Yeah, you're worried about doing it
with your mom. Okay, fair enough.

07:59.353 --> 08:03.524
Fuckin' cameras everywhere. That cup
is a camera. That tree is a camera.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.194
-Can you disable them?
-Stealth rule number one:

08:06.277 --> 08:09.572
turning off 300 cameras draws
more attention than changing outfits.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.533
Looks like we need to dress for success.

08:12.617 --> 08:15.536
Eye of Thundara,
give me suits beyond suits.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.248
Jerry assistant clothing, make-up.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.089
-What the hell was that?
-Reuseable Sailor Moon sequence.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.300
If we ever need to show you
becoming my assistant again,

08:29.383 --> 08:31.010
we can repeat it and
save lots of money.

08:38.309 --> 08:41.520
Why does an operation bigger than
the government want me to

08:41.604 --> 08:43.022
couple with my mother?

08:58.329 --> 09:01.499
Bezos, Bill Gates, prime ministers.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.459
Weirdly Billy Zane is also here.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.046
Hello. You're about to meet me,
Jennith Padrow-Chunt.

09:07.463 --> 09:10.299
Fifteen years ago, I was living in
my parent’s garage,

09:10.383 --> 09:13.177
eating ramen out of a toilet
when I discovered something.

09:13.761 --> 09:18.349
Fate isn’t fiction. Everything you want
can be yours, if you ask for it.

09:18.432 --> 09:20.184
Just ask me.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.103
-Hello, me.
-Hello, me.

09:22.186 --> 09:25.439
Look at me's. Every suit I wear
is virgin white.

09:25.523 --> 09:28.985
I sleep on a bed of loose grains,
and begin every morning by dragging

09:29.068 --> 09:33.197
my perfect vagina across
Chinese silver grass. I'm firm and ripe.

09:34.448 --> 09:37.410
My mother's plane just landed.
She took a photo at the airport,

09:37.493 --> 09:39.662
in front of that Wolfgang Puck
that smells like a kindergarten.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.540
Want to know the secret
to how I changed my future?

09:42.623 --> 09:45.293
-Yes.
-Well, once you're a level seven investor

09:45.376 --> 09:47.003
you'll learn that and more.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.298
Yeah, we're not getting the answers
we want here. Let's go deeper.

09:55.594 --> 09:58.055
And now, thanks to your
generous contributions,

09:58.139 --> 09:59.348
here are this year's cookies.

10:01.142 --> 10:04.729
''You will receive a six-point-eight
percent year on year increase'' Very nice.

10:04.812 --> 10:09.275
''Your talents are appreciated
when you become junior partner.''

10:09.358 --> 10:12.445
Holy shit I'm gonna be on
'Dancing with the Stars'!

10:12.528 --> 10:17.325
-Please, I can get the money. I swear!
-I'm afraid it's too late for that.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.702
God what does it say?

10:20.202 --> 10:24.373
Your penis will be mangled by
afrozen yogurt machine at the U.N.!

10:24.457 --> 10:25.583
I know that machine!

10:25.666 --> 10:29.253
This would sound impossible to a layman
but to me it rings inevitable!

10:29.337 --> 10:33.424
Holy shit. This is real.
They're controlling fate for profit.

10:33.507 --> 10:36.427
I'm glad you're happy, now can we
blow up the building or something?

10:36.510 --> 10:39.096
I don't think that's the best way
to take away their power, Jerry.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.140
Let's take it in a way
that ends with us having it.

10:41.223 --> 10:43.267
-You mean you having it.
-I'll share it.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.478
-Then you fuck my mom.
-That's not how it works

10:45.561 --> 10:47.438
-and I already have.
-What?

10:47.521 --> 10:49.190
Jesus, Jerry, come on.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.151
How unfortunate.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.445
Use the emergency fortunes!

10:55.363 --> 10:57.323
Fighting Fortunes? They're leveling up.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.993
''You'll have great success in a fight''

11:02.119 --> 11:03.120
I'll be damned

11:09.293 --> 11:11.545
Fuck! This both sucks and
is really valuable data!

11:16.675 --> 11:19.095
-Rick what are you doing?!
-Using you as a human shield!

11:19.178 --> 11:21.347
You said it! You said the thing
I thought you were doing!!

11:23.432 --> 11:27.645
We've got intruders. And one of them
has an unresolved fortune.

11:29.730 --> 11:33.067
-We need that man's mother.
-Lot of mothers in the world, ma'am.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.985
But only one of them is Mrs.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.405
God damn it, Smith?

11:43.077 --> 11:46.664
So are we going to ignore that you
tried to stop bullets using my body?

11:46.747 --> 11:49.417
You have an unresolved fortune.
Until you have sex with your mom,

11:49.500 --> 11:52.420
you're basically immortal. Do you have
any idea how amazing that is?

11:52.503 --> 11:56.006
You don't even care about me.
You just want fortune cookie power.

11:56.674 --> 11:59.635
Okay, Jerry, how about this.
If it comes down to it,

11:59.718 --> 12:02.138
-I promise I'll put a bullet in her head.
-No!

12:02.221 --> 12:04.557
You're right, the fortune didn't say
she'd be alive, did it?

12:04.640 --> 12:06.475
-I hate you!
-Hate productive things.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.519
Hate crawling through a fucking air vent.

12:09.603 --> 12:12.690
Those are those weird hex headed screws.
Do your screwdriver fingers...

12:29.081 --> 12:30.499
Here you go.

12:31.542 --> 12:34.420
Well, at least we have no idea
what's going on.

12:34.503 --> 12:37.548
That's a Lockerean.
It's a species that eats chaos.

12:37.631 --> 12:41.010
But It has a digestive disorder
Its stomach is stripping randomness

12:41.093 --> 12:43.554
from spacetime and leaving behind
superdense pockets of energy

12:43.637 --> 12:46.056
that bend entropy towards
definable outcomes.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.726
I mean, that's how fate works.
It's a field, like gravity,

12:48.809 --> 12:52.021
but instead of pulling small toward big
it pulls unknown toward known.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.398
-So we do know what’s going on.
-We know this:

12:54.482 --> 12:56.734
everyone that's had a fortune cookie
in the last twenty years

12:56.817 --> 12:59.737
has eaten this thing's poop.
Fortune cookies are alien poop.

13:01.405 --> 13:02.698
These fortunes are so basic.

13:02.781 --> 13:05.075
Why wouldn't you use this
power to change the world?

13:05.159 --> 13:07.912
Or at least get Nintendo
to make a portable VR headset.

13:07.995 --> 13:11.582
This place ain't for creating
the future, but controlling it.

13:11.665 --> 13:16.545
Hi, I'm Old. Old M. Hucksbee.
The M. Stands for Man.

13:16.629 --> 13:20.090
You're an arch little character.
You're the reason fortune cookies suck?

13:20.174 --> 13:22.092
No, that's Jenneth Chunt's idea.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.470
You have to glut the marketplace
with pointless fortunes

13:24.553 --> 13:26.388
to increase the value of real ones.

13:26.472 --> 13:30.643
Controlling destiny for a price,
that's the Fortune 500's fortune.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.688
-And you're trying to stop them?
-Just trying to get out.

13:34.772 --> 13:38.692
I want to be free with this here
alien gal so we can get married.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.444
Then we can have relations.

13:40.528 --> 13:43.697
Can't do that before marriage, you know.
I'm a Catholic.

13:44.114 --> 13:45.407
Does the alien want that?

13:45.491 --> 13:47.993
It's not exactly what I'd call
a sentient species.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.119
A man knows.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.704
What does this have to do with me?

13:51.038 --> 13:52.581
You put this in my cookie.

13:53.624 --> 13:57.336
I been trying to get people's attention.
I'd make fortunes saying

13:57.419 --> 14:00.965
''You're gonna break your leg unless
you investigate this cookie company.''

14:01.048 --> 14:04.552
or ''please come help me or
a virus will shut down the world,''

14:04.635 --> 14:06.554
finally I just made a bunch that said

14:06.637 --> 14:09.139
"You’re gonna have sex
with your own momma."

14:09.223 --> 14:11.433
How many?
It, what happened to the others?

14:11.517 --> 14:13.352
I 'spose they fucked their moms.

14:13.435 --> 14:16.021
Now let's cut her chains
and get the hell out of here.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.150
Well, shit on a spaghetti.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.570
Hello Jerry Smith.
Glad you could join us

14:22.653 --> 14:25.155
-on bring your mother to work day.
-Mom!

14:25.239 --> 14:29.368
Hi, Jerry. Your friends
picked me up in a limousine.

14:29.451 --> 14:32.204
They said you won something and
I should be the one to give it to you?

14:32.288 --> 14:34.582
-You sick fucks.
-Are you guys enjoying this?

14:34.665 --> 14:37.585
I used to think I was
just a regular white woman.

14:37.668 --> 14:40.254
Then I discovered I could
control my destiny.

14:40.337 --> 14:43.340
All white women think that.
The truth is, this alien crashed

14:43.424 --> 14:47.052
-in your yard and you ate its shit.
-How dare you. What’s your name?

14:47.136 --> 14:49.680
How dare you?
We should’ve blown up the building.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.432
Doesn't matter.
All I was gonna say is:

14:51.515 --> 14:55.352
guess what, insert name,
time for you to eat shit. But first.

14:57.104 --> 15:00.024
-No, I'm so wet.
-No.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.358
Jerry. Come back and block bullets.

15:01.442 --> 15:04.153
Authorizing the use of prototype fortunes.

15:11.201 --> 15:12.453
-Fuck!
-You can't hide.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.288
My fortune said ''eadshots Only.''

15:16.290 --> 15:19.251
Harry, Greg, Lashawn,
Dave C, Dave M, no!

15:19.335 --> 15:21.128
You piece of shit you killed my friends.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.132
Alright, what does the future hold?

15:31.555 --> 15:33.098
Maybe I can Pokémon this shit.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.225
Blast him or we're both gonna die.

15:35.559 --> 15:36.560
Oh god, oh god.

15:37.645 --> 15:41.231
You control-control water.
Like, the water inside a guy.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.983
That's a gross power.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.698
I’m gonna let you live because
your fortune sucks.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.575
You can't kill me.
I can't be killed.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.244
Trust me, that's not
as good as it sounds.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.625
It hurts! It burns!

15:59.708 --> 16:04.046
Fuck! Oh my god my ribs!
I can feel my shattered ribs.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.431
Shit these are useless.
Where are the fighting fortunes?

16:14.515 --> 16:18.268
No no! Those are blanks!
Without fortunes,

16:18.352 --> 16:21.480
-the effects are completely unpredictable!
-Alright.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.576
I am the son of god.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.167
Jerry! Help me, Jerry!

16:42.251 --> 16:45.254
Mom, stay away! Just stay away!

16:45.337 --> 16:47.339
Come on and fuck already!

16:47.673 --> 16:50.634
Ma'am, is it possible we're being
given a chance to take a step back

16:50.718 --> 16:52.094
and examine our behav....

16:54.388 --> 16:58.976
You can't kill me, old man.
I also have an unresolved fortune.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.937
''The most successful
businesswoman on Earth?''

17:02.020 --> 17:04.565
You could do anything you wanted
and you chose... work?

17:05.566 --> 17:08.152
Every day I get closer
to an unattainable goal.

17:08.235 --> 17:11.488
A one-woman lifestyle brand, forever.

17:11.572 --> 17:14.199
Well, I just used a dark web account
to hack Goldman Sachs,

17:14.283 --> 17:17.286
remove trillions of dollars, and purchase
everything your company offers.

17:17.369 --> 17:20.664
Congratulations, you're officially the
most successful business woman on Earth.

17:21.081 --> 17:23.292
Fortune fulfilled. And now,
I'm emptying your bank accounts

17:23.375 --> 17:25.127
and giving the money back
to Goldman Sachs.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.296
Because I sit dead center
on the alignment chart.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.340
You son of a bitch!

17:30.424 --> 17:32.676
How does it feel to achieve your dreams?
Empty, right?

17:33.260 --> 17:36.096
Like when DiCaprio won the Oscar.
You could see it in his face.

17:36.597 --> 17:40.309
I still have one more dream,

17:40.392 --> 17:45.689
watching you die, Rick Sanchez!

17:46.023 --> 17:47.024
You knew my name.

17:57.159 --> 18:00.579
She's free!
Run, run my beauty!

18:06.627 --> 18:08.629
Well, butterfly on a corncob.

18:08.712 --> 18:13.383
I see that I've romanticized a wild animal
the same way Margret Howe did

18:13.467 --> 18:16.553
when she jerked off that dolphin
in the nineteen-and sixty's.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.640
Both she and I assaulted
a captive creature,

18:19.723 --> 18:22.059
then expected it to be reciprocal.

18:22.476 --> 18:25.270
Welp, joopity boot! Time to die.

18:29.650 --> 18:32.236
Follow me, my queen!

18:35.239 --> 18:37.533
That's all the bad guys down,
we almost got this, Jer.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.499
No!

18:45.582 --> 18:49.002
Sticks to walls guy,
I guess we were both wrong!

18:50.462 --> 18:51.505
Oh god.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.267
-Rick, please!
-Jerry, I've got the creature.

19:03.350 --> 19:06.144
-I knew it. I knew it.
-God damn it

19:12.401 --> 19:13.318
Oh god!

19:16.196 --> 19:17.114
Goddammit.

19:24.705 --> 19:27.332
-Holy shit that was close.
-Close to what?

19:27.666 --> 19:31.086
Close to everyone but your son
getting anything they want forever.

19:31.169 --> 19:32.129
You saved me.

19:32.212 --> 19:36.216
I will never stop holding this over you.
As if that buys me anything.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.968
We should get you some clothes, son.

19:43.348 --> 19:44.975
I can just feel the savings.

19:46.727 --> 19:50.689
Hey wait. Got this
at the crazy place we just were.

19:51.106 --> 19:54.526
It may look like someone stuck a
hand-written fortune in there last second,

19:54.610 --> 19:56.445
but I'm pretty sure
that's just the way it came.

19:57.112 --> 19:58.655
Besides, these don’t mean anything.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.618
Jerry, while I appreciate the sentiment,

20:02.701 --> 20:05.329
thisis a huge waste
of the last real fortune.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.457
-I'm sorry, I just...
-It's cool, it's cool.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.083
Thanks, friend.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.669
-Friend! Did you just say friend?
-What, what did I do?

20:12.753 --> 20:16.048
You fucking idiot! I’m not your friend!
Why did you think I was your friend?

20:16.131 --> 20:18.467
-Look at this you piece of shit.
-Yeah, yeah, yes, so

20:18.550 --> 20:21.178
I was immortal!
I was immortal for that whole fight!

20:21.261 --> 20:23.180
All I had to do was
never make a new friend!

20:23.263 --> 20:25.682
-Jesus fucking Christ Jerry.
-I'm sorry! We're not friends!

20:25.766 --> 20:29.144
Yeah, too late, bonehead, it doesn't say
''new permanent friend,''

20:29.227 --> 20:31.438
all friendships end.
Especially new ones.

20:32.147 --> 20:35.233
Well maybe that’s a fate
the two of us still control.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.575
-I'm sorry I did that.
-It's fine.

21:25.200 --> 21:29.454
The zoo, animals, balloons, moats, cages.
A fun time for the whole family.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.707
But you don't care about that,
you're a zebra.

21:31.790 --> 21:35.293
You're here for the unparalleled dining
experience of hand-fed zebra food.

21:35.377 --> 21:39.172
Delicious. Wait, don't eat.
That's for the zebras.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.091
It's making you sick.
What are you doing?

21:41.174 --> 21:44.094
Jesus, why have they left all the zebra
feeding to the people who come to the zoo

21:44.177 --> 21:46.596
Is that the only way the zebras
can get food? They’re so hungry.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.266
What the fuck is happening?
We're out of zebra food, okay?

21:49.349 --> 21:51.268
There's no food left,
don't come to the zoo.

21:51.351 --> 21:54.312
This was supposed to be a commercial
for zebras, targeted to zebras!

21:54.396 --> 21:57.274
The premise itself was questionable
but this is a nightmare!

21:57.357 --> 21:59.317
Don’t go to the zoo.
Stay away from the zoo.

21:59.401 --> 22:02.279
God what are you doing in the booth?
Get out! Get out, you're mad...

22:04.114 --> 22:07.451
Eat it. Eat zebra food.

22:07.534 --> 22:10.620
Okay, I guess I can’t blame Dad
for being confused about what to do

22:10.704 --> 22:14.124
with the zebra food. Also, I have no idea
why they're running this ad, like

22:14.207 --> 22:16.126
on a loop? There were murders in it.

22:16.209 --> 22:19.046
And it was specifically telling you to do
the thing it didn’t want you to do,

22:19.129 --> 22:20.714
until the very end,
when it reversed.

22:20.797 --> 22:23.592
Why would they sell the zebra food
in the gift shop, unless.

22:23.675 --> 22:27.137
I mean, do the zebras shop in here?
Are we the ones in the zoo?

22:27.220 --> 22:30.057
Is that the twist?
OK, we're, it's a human zoo. Got it.
