WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:03.529
He's coming in today.
That's what I heard.

00:03.570 --> 00:05.162
Lockhart, Gardner.

00:05.200 --> 00:06.633
One second.

00:06.670 --> 00:09.434
Margie said he's coming in
for a divorce settlement.

00:09.470 --> 00:11.700
I thought he was dead.
Agos & Florrick.

00:11.740 --> 00:13.332
I'm sorry,
she's on the other line.

00:13.380 --> 00:14.677
Okay.

00:15.680 --> 00:16.669
What's Chrissy doing?

00:16.710 --> 00:18.473
Oh, you don't know, do you?

00:18.510 --> 00:20.649
When they put in the sign,
they left a hole in the wall.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.648
If you stand just right,
you can hear everything

00:22.690 --> 00:23.543
going on in the
conference room.

00:23.590 --> 00:24.784
(whispers)'
No! '

00:24.820 --> 00:26.651
(hollow tapping)

00:26.690 --> 00:28.180
(no audio)

00:31.090 --> 00:32.751
Hey, information is power.

00:41.340 --> 00:44.332
(muffled voice speaking)

00:47.540 --> 00:49.371
DAVID: Harper & Greene has this
wonderful little corner office

00:49.410 --> 00:50.377
just right for me.

00:50.410 --> 00:52.571
DIANE: Come on, David,
we go back a long ways.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.269
DAVID:
Yes, and you always had

00:54.320 --> 00:56.345
such admiration
for family law.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.539
Face it,

00:57.590 --> 00:59.581
I do my thing,
you do yours.

00:59.620 --> 01:01.349
Only difference is,
mine makes money.

01:01.390 --> 01:03.529
It's a bad economy,
David, that's all.

01:03.560 --> 01:04.720
We're righting the ship.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.193
Then right it.

01:06.230 --> 01:08.118
I have no love

01:08.160 --> 01:09.661
for this place,
but I don't want to jump

01:09.700 --> 01:11.759
to Harper & Greene
unless I have to.

01:11.800 --> 01:12.835
I don't like boxes.

01:12.870 --> 01:15.361
We're bringing in
a third partner.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.867
Yes, I've heard about
this messiah partner

01:16.910 --> 01:18.662
for two months now.
Can't wait.

01:18.710 --> 01:19.677
You could help us.

01:19.710 --> 01:21.803
Collect on overdue accounts.

01:21.840 --> 01:24.206
Yes, that's our problem.

01:27.180 --> 01:30.445
they'd bolt to another firm
before I can hang up.

01:30.490 --> 01:31.684
Give us till
the end of the week?

01:31.720 --> 01:34.757
That's what I like to hear.

01:35.820 --> 01:37.321
(door closes)

01:37.360 --> 01:39.157
We'll cull the herd.

01:42.530 --> 01:43.622
Lou...

01:43.670 --> 01:45.297
Jocelyn...

01:45.330 --> 01:47.366
Derek.

01:48.740 --> 01:50.537
And Lenny.

01:50.570 --> 01:53.277
Accounts Lenny?
Or Litigation?

01:53.310 --> 01:54.470
Litigation.

01:54.510 --> 01:56.808
That's two of yours

01:56.850 --> 01:58.670
and two of mine.

01:58.710 --> 02:00.519
And the junior associates.

02:01.850 --> 02:03.738
We have to decide now.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.746
Cary or Alicia?

02:06.960 --> 02:09.155
WILL: Friday.
We'll decide Friday.

02:09.190 --> 02:10.521
DIANE:
Good.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.699
WILL: And let's keep it
to ourselves, okay?

02:12.730 --> 02:13.549
I don't want to deal with

02:13.600 --> 02:15.693
a lot of last-minute
maneuvering on this.

02:29.810 --> 02:30.777
(knocking)

02:30.810 --> 02:32.846
Alicia. Oh.

02:32.880 --> 02:33.778
I'm sorry.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.845
Mr. Gold in my office.

02:35.880 --> 02:36.881
Again.

02:36.920 --> 02:38.785
Sorry, Alicia.
I was upstairs.

02:38.820 --> 02:41.618
And David Lee needs
to see you In ten minutes.

02:47.760 --> 02:50.320
Hey, really good
work on my brief.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.588
Thanks.
You want to_ be
a paralegal, right?

02:52.640 --> 02:53.664
Yeah, someday.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.895
All right, well,
any help you need.

03:03.780 --> 03:05.771
Cary, do you
have a minute?

03:05.810 --> 03:07.641
Sure. What's up?

03:07.680 --> 03:10.478
I just heard
something upstairs.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.681
There's a good chance
that the state's attorney

03:16.730 --> 03:17.879
won't prosecute Peter.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.952
Because of Kozko's suicide?

03:22.000 --> 03:23.888
Actually, yes.

03:23.930 --> 03:25.022
And if that does happen,

03:25.070 --> 03:28.289
you and I will have to get
on the same page quickly.

03:28.340 --> 03:29.705
What page is that?

03:29.740 --> 03:32.004
The campaign.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.679
I won't do interviews,
and I won't do photos.

03:34.710 --> 03:36.905
I know,
and I respect that.
My children won't, either.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.418
IfI could be so bold...

03:39.450 --> 03:40.712
No, you can't.

03:40.750 --> 03:42.342
Right. Got it.

03:43.550 --> 03:45.518
Anyway, that's
not why I'm here.

03:45.550 --> 03:46.812
Peter's got it
into his head

03:46.860 --> 03:48.714
that he won't run
unless you approve.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.419
I know, I tried
to convince him otherwise.

03:52.460 --> 03:55.327
I told him that wives
just get in the way, but...

03:55.360 --> 03:56.725
he's adamant.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.762
Mr. Gold, Peter is an adult.

03:59.800 --> 04:00.960
He doesn't
need a mother.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.831
We talking about you or me?

04:02.870 --> 04:03.905
(laughs)

04:03.940 --> 04:05.805
I have to get back to work.

04:05.840 --> 04:08.832
Think about it,
Mrs. Florrick.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.906
Glenn Childs is a disastrous
state's attorney.

04:11.950 --> 04:14.669
But you know that
better than I do.

04:17.990 --> 04:19.878
More kettle corn.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.059
Thank you.
This one is
bubble gum flavored.

04:22.090 --> 04:23.682
Oh, and cotton candy.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.482
Look-- separated.
I see that.

04:25.530 --> 04:27.054
Another divorce case?

04:27.100 --> 04:28.658
With a prenup.

04:28.700 --> 04:30.429
Her expectations
are too high.

04:30.470 --> 04:32.597
We have to get her down
to $300,000.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.437
Alicia, can I get
a minute with you?

04:34.470 --> 04:35.664
Regarding?

04:36.710 --> 04:39.304
That's all right.
Later.

04:41.010 --> 04:42.773
DAVID:
See? I told you.

04:42.810 --> 04:45.040
Here she is.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.674
Mrs. Caroline Wilder,
meet Alicia Florrick.

04:47.720 --> 04:48.709
Mrs. Florrick.

04:48.750 --> 04:50.445
It's really nice
to meet you.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.515
I think I'll be
turning to you

04:52.560 --> 04:53.982
for advice on how
to bounce back.

04:54.020 --> 04:56.523
But first things first--
Alicia and I

04:56.560 --> 04:58.926
were just discussing our "ask."

04:58.960 --> 05:00.052
She worries our eyes

05:00.100 --> 05:01.795
might be a little bigger
than our stomachs.

05:01.830 --> 05:03.422
Alicia.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.098
The prenup makes it
very difficult, Caroline.

05:06.130 --> 05:08.860
I was young and in love,

05:08.900 --> 05:10.800
and all of his
hit records

05:10.840 --> 05:12.102
happened before
we were married.

05:12.140 --> 05:14.836
Oh. Caroline Wilder
of Max Wilder?

05:14.880 --> 05:17.508
Oh, soon to be
ex-Max Wilder.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.916
I'm so sorry;
I didn't know.
It's okay.

05:19.950 --> 05:22.077
I'm being traded in
for a younger model.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.519
It happens.

05:23.550 --> 05:25.040
I could go to
couples therapy,

05:25.090 --> 05:27.718
I could get
a face-lift,

05:27.760 --> 05:29.955
but I can't be
28 years old again.

05:32.060 --> 05:34.494
You know the best revenge,
Caroline?

05:34.530 --> 05:36.623
I would love to know.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.023
Make him see how happy you are.

05:38.070 --> 05:39.890
(laughs softly)

05:39.940 --> 05:42.067
Let us be angry for you.

05:43.970 --> 05:46.473
CAROLINE:
Well, here comes
the parade.

05:52.010 --> 05:54.046
I thought it was just
gonna be us, Max.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.445
Oh, Shaina wanted to come.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.640
It's my right.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.442
(sighs)
Great.

05:58.490 --> 06:00.048
Love it.

06:01.620 --> 06:03.884
Okay, so, here's where we stand.

06:03.930 --> 06:05.158
DAVID:
Chocolate raisins, anyone?

06:05.190 --> 06:06.418
No, thank you.
MAX:
I will.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.093
We've reviewed
your counter--

06:10.130 --> 06:11.995
thank you for that,
by the way--

06:12.030 --> 06:13.793
and we've decided

06:13.840 --> 06:15.762
we're sticking with
our original offer.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.028
Ah. Well,

06:17.070 --> 06:20.039
that's unacceptable.
Yeah, we don't think it is.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.002
CAROLINE:
Max, after everything
we've been through,

06:22.040 --> 06:26.613
do you really believe
that $140,000 a year is fair?

06:26.650 --> 06:27.912
Well, I never thought of you

06:27.950 --> 06:29.918
as being greedy, Caroline.
Says the man

06:29.950 --> 06:31.383
with the $40 million estate.

06:35.760 --> 06:39.753
(laughs):
Look, we're not here
to argue or bandy numbers about.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.791
We've, uh, got
a court date tomorrow.

06:41.830 --> 06:44.993
Max has been more than generous
with his offer.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.430
We advise you to take it.

06:49.170 --> 06:51.604
Could you give
us a minute?

06:54.180 --> 06:57.547
Max Wilder is on probation
for a 2007 possession charge,

06:59.180 --> 07:01.512
to leave the country
this weekend.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.946
Flight reservations
to Bora-Bora.

07:04.990 --> 07:07.015
Rental of a room
to accommodate 80.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.516
They're getting married.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.528
If he makes tomorrow's
court date.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.118
How do you get
this stuff?

07:12.160 --> 07:13.559
Fnends.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.591
Just give me an
army of women.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.022
DAVID:
Sorry for that.

07:19.070 --> 07:20.958
We have your offer--

07:21.000 --> 07:23.002
thank you--

07:23.040 --> 07:25.804
and we'll just need
a few days to mull it.
Actually,

07:25.840 --> 07:27.831
no, we have
a court date tomorrow.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.973
Yes, well, why don't
we just push that off.

07:30.010 --> 07:32.149
I-I don't think
you understand.

07:32.180 --> 07:33.647
This offer came
with a clock.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.875
We need an answer now,
or we walk.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.740
Then walk.

07:38.620 --> 07:39.712
Let them go, David.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.988
Oh, Alicia,

07:41.020 --> 07:43.079
don't take out your
aggressions on this.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.553
It's insulting--
$140,000 a year.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.728
David, look,

07:48.760 --> 07:50.728
if we get an
agreement now,

07:50.770 --> 07:54.228
we can go up to $180,000,
but that exhausts our cushion.

07:54.270 --> 07:55.669
Nope, sorry.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.008
Let's take the weekend.

07:58.170 --> 07:59.706
A-Alicia, wait.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.741
Help me out with this.

08:04.780 --> 08:07.669
I want this to work.

08:11.220 --> 08:13.154
$300,000.

08:13.190 --> 08:15.078
Nicely played.
Thank you.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.781
How you doing,
Caroline?

08:16.830 --> 08:17.854
I'm fine...

08:17.890 --> 08:21.758
soon as I go home and have
a big bag of mint Milanos.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.898
(sighs) Ah, I thought I was
completely over him.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.238
Hey, John, if you could
put in a good word for me

08:29.270 --> 08:30.806
with Will and Diane.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.774
I think they're deciding
on junior associates this week.

08:32.810 --> 08:34.107
CARY:
I mean, the thing is,

08:34.140 --> 08:36.540
I like Alicia.
I think she's
doing really well,

08:36.580 --> 08:38.605
given all her problems
at home, you know?

08:38.650 --> 08:40.777
It's not really ageism
to ask how many more

08:40.820 --> 08:42.708
good working years
does anyone have left.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.638
That just makes
good sense.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.679
(chuckles)

08:45.720 --> 08:49.679
(phone ringing)

08:49.730 --> 08:51.288
(thud)

08:51.330 --> 08:52.649
Oh. Sorry, Your Honor.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.826
It's an important call.

08:53.860 --> 08:54.827
My client...

08:54.860 --> 08:55.929
Then_let me answer
It for you.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.668
Anybody else?

09:02.710 --> 09:03.961
Good.

09:04.010 --> 09:06.160
Then I understand we've
reached an agreement.

09:06.210 --> 09:07.108
Yes, Your Honor.

09:07.140 --> 09:09.643
Mrs. Wilder has acquiesced
to a divorce.

09:09.680 --> 09:11.238
We have a signed
divorce agreement.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.077
JUDGE STANEK: And Mr.
Wilder-- where is he?

09:13.120 --> 09:14.144
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

09:14.180 --> 09:16.239
My guess is that was
in fact Mr. Wilder calling.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.713
(phone vibrating)

09:17.750 --> 09:19.889
Oh. Then it's
unfortunate you didn't

09:19.920 --> 09:21.785
answer it before
court, Counselor.

09:21.820 --> 09:24.926
If I could ask for
a 30-minute recess, Your Honor,

09:24.960 --> 09:27.053
to ascertain
Mr. Wilder's whereabouts.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.897
We have no problem with that,
Your Honor.

09:28.930 --> 09:32.093
JUDGE STANEK:
Mr. Kreutzer, In my courtroom,
the people's time

09:32.130 --> 09:34.269
will be respected,
even by rock stars.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.905
You have five minutes
to locate him.

09:38.940 --> 09:40.271
JUDGE STANEK:
Five minutes!

09:49.690 --> 09:51.112
What happened?

09:51.150 --> 09:53.948
Max Wilder was just
in a motorcycle accident.

09:53.990 --> 09:56.652
Is-Is he all right?

09:56.690 --> 09:58.282
(chuckles):
No, he's in a coma.

09:58.330 --> 09:59.285
Can you believe it?

09:59.330 --> 10:00.194
Kreutzer's gonna have a fit.

10:00.230 --> 10:02.118
Yes, Margie...
Shh, shh, shh, just listen.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.162
You made notes
on the Wilder prenup.

10:04.200 --> 10:07.067
What does it say
on power of attorney?

10:07.100 --> 10:08.135
She could get half.

10:08.170 --> 10:11.162
Yep. If he stays in a coma,
$40 million estate.

10:11.210 --> 10:12.700
Margie, you're killing me.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.233
We need to tell her.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.942
No, no, no. We need to
make her filthy rich first.

10:18.980 --> 10:21.210
Margie, now!

10:22.280 --> 10:23.884
We're good.
We're good.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.060
What did you do?
Your Honor,

10:37.100 --> 10:39.318
we already have
a divorce agreement.

10:39.370 --> 10:41.338
It's not signed. We don't have
a properly signed...

10:41.370 --> 10:43.361
'Cause you took a page!
Stop it, the both of you.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.162
JUDGE STANEK:
Where's Mr. Wilder?

10:45.210 --> 10:47.007
KREUTZER:
He was in an accident,
Your Honor.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.735
He's in a coma, but
this divorce is done.

10:48.780 --> 10:51.203
Your Honor, in our rush
to get to the court on time,

10:51.250 --> 10:52.672
I'm afraid we may
have overlooked

10:52.720 --> 10:56.110
the very last page
of the divorce agreement.

10:56.150 --> 10:57.287
KREUTZER:
David, come on!

10:57.320 --> 10:58.309
JUDGE STANEK:
Stop it!

11:03.790 --> 11:07.692
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

11:18.470 --> 11:20.938
DAVID:
You don't understand.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.801
This just turned into
a $40 million divorce.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.169
No, it's just me and Alicia.

11:25.210 --> 11:26.711
I need troops.

11:26.750 --> 11:29.139
On their way,
and I'll take litigation.

11:29.180 --> 11:32.149
(sighs)

11:32.190 --> 11:34.158
Max Wilder was just
in a motorcycle accident.

11:34.190 --> 11:35.748
He's in a coma.

11:35.790 --> 11:37.223
You're kidding.
No.

11:37.260 --> 11:41.321
And our client controls
his $40 million estate

11:41.360 --> 11:43.021
if he stays in a coma.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.220
(whistles)
Here's the rub.

11:45.270 --> 11:47.067
David's looking at the will.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.988
Our guess is
he wrote our client out.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.065
So if he dies...
She gets nothing.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.008
Just the prenup.

11:52.040 --> 11:55.931
So we're cheering for him
to stay in a coma?

11:55.980 --> 11:57.402
Effectively.

11:57.450 --> 11:57.905
(sighs)

11:57.950 --> 11:58.609
We're like ghouls.

11:58.650 --> 12:00.709
As long as we're solvent ghouls.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.445
(sighs)

12:03.490 --> 12:06.755
Oh, uh, what do you think
of Vernon Jordan?

12:06.790 --> 12:09.258
What do I think
of Vernon Jordan?
Yes.

12:09.290 --> 12:10.780
As a third partner.

12:10.830 --> 12:13.151
Oh. I...

12:13.200 --> 12:14.394
Is that a possibility?

12:14.430 --> 12:16.091
He's been sniffing around us,

12:16.130 --> 12:17.995
looking for an opening
into Chicago.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.793
Well, that
would be...
A lifesaver.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.967
We wouldn't have
to make cuts.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.059
I'll try to set up a meeting.

12:24.110 --> 12:26.328
CARY: I'll take any
support I can get.
Uh, Cary?

12:27.380 --> 12:30.144
I need you on the
Wilder divorce.

12:30.180 --> 12:31.772
It suddenly became important.

12:31.810 --> 12:33.414
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
Anything.

12:33.450 --> 12:35.042
I'll head off
right away.

12:38.190 --> 12:40.215
I didn't say anything.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.149
(footsteps approaching)

12:45.560 --> 12:47.949
Oh, my God.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.968
Hey.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.025
(sniffles)

12:52.070 --> 12:54.891
They say he just swerved
into oncoming traffic.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.829
I always hated
that thing.

12:57.870 --> 13:00.304
Alicia, this is
Jay Van Zandt.
Hi.

13:00.340 --> 13:02.399
CAROLINE:
Max's manager.

13:02.440 --> 13:03.998
Alicia's my lavwer.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.199
(sighs)

13:05.250 --> 13:06.547
I don't know.

13:06.580 --> 13:08.047
Maybe I shouldn't
be here.

13:08.080 --> 13:11.243
He talked about you, Caroline,
just last week.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.985
No, he didn't.

13:13.020 --> 13:14.988
Don't try
to make me feel better.

13:17.090 --> 13:18.887
He looks so 5...

13:18.930 --> 13:21.091
DAVID:
3.4 million in Kauai.

13:21.130 --> 13:24.019
5.5 million of the
properties in Chicago.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.526
You can't use your
cell phone in here.

13:25.570 --> 13:27.037
You know
that's a myth, right?

13:27.070 --> 13:29.288
Where's the doctor?
He's in with
Mrs. Wilder.

13:29.340 --> 13:31.160
DAVID:
Mrs...?!

13:34.940 --> 13:36.999
The helmet protected the
frontal and temporal bone,

13:37.050 --> 13:38.540
but the base of the
helmet snapped back,

13:38.580 --> 13:40.514
causing severe trauma
to the cerebellum.

13:40.550 --> 13:42.939
We've stopped
the bleeding, but...

13:42.990 --> 13:44.116
I'm sorry.

13:44.150 --> 13:45.617
It's a subdural hematoma.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.515
Which means...?

13:47.560 --> 13:49.926
Mrs. Wilder, your husband
is effectively brain dead.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.052
I'm sorry.

13:51.090 --> 13:52.125
But not dead dead?

13:52.160 --> 13:54.151
He... Excuse
me, who...?

13:54.200 --> 13:56.919
I'm his wife.
You divorced him.

13:56.970 --> 13:57.925
She did not.

13:57.970 --> 13:59.221
KREUTZER: _
Doctor, are you saying

13:59.270 --> 14:02.194
that Mr. Wilder
can never be revived?

14:02.240 --> 14:03.502
Effectively, yes.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.531
Doctor, I look
at contracts all day long,

14:05.570 --> 14:07.231
and when I see
the word "effectively,"

14:07.280 --> 14:09.578
I know it means "no."

14:09.610 --> 14:11.043
Medicine, sir,
is not a contract.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.116
With this massive loss
of brain tissue, there's

14:13.150 --> 14:15.869
a one-in-a-million likelihood
he would revrve.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.387
But a million-to-one means life.

14:17.420 --> 14:19.479
And life needs to be cherished
and treasured.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.511
What other value
do we hold higher?

14:21.560 --> 14:23.118
DOCTOR:
Sir, the only thing

14:23.160 --> 14:26.027
that's keeping Mr. Wilder
alive is a machine.

14:26.060 --> 14:27.254
In essence,
he's already dead.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.029
Doctor?

14:29.060 --> 14:30.061
Do you have
another assessment?

14:30.100 --> 14:31.089
No.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.228
I had a patient.

14:37.270 --> 14:39.465
He fell off a
ladder in 1988,

14:39.510 --> 14:42.399
and he ended up in a
persistent vegetative state.

14:42.440 --> 14:46.206
I made the same speech
that I just heard in there.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.969
And then, 21 years later,

14:49.020 --> 14:50.988
he just woke up.

14:51.020 --> 14:54.080
I don't know any
other way to say it.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.611
He woke up from
a 21-year sleep.

14:58.690 --> 15:01.090
_ He was a
one-In-a-mllllon shot.

15:01.130 --> 15:04.566
And, yes, science
and medicine deal

15:04.600 --> 15:07.034
in repeatable phenomena,
and not this.

15:07.070 --> 15:11.063
But I don't make
that speech anymore.

15:16.980 --> 15:19.574
CARY:
Shaina has filed

15:19.610 --> 15:21.168
a petition
for legal guardianship,

15:21.220 --> 15:22.209
so she can unplug Max.

15:22.250 --> 15:24.115
She can file
all she wants.

15:24.150 --> 15:25.242
Wife trumps girlfriend.

15:25.290 --> 15:27.258
DAVID: My guess is
Kreutzer argues intent.

15:27.290 --> 15:30.020
Both Max Wilder and Caroline
initialed all

15:30.060 --> 15:32.654
but the last missing page
of a divorce settlement.

15:32.690 --> 15:34.157
Good job,
by the way, Alicia.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.690
WI_LL: When are we
In court agaIn?

15:35.730 --> 15:36.719
Tomorrow.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.990
Should we be talking
about negotiating with Shaina?

15:39.030 --> 15:41.191
Caroline could live
WIth half the estate.
CARY: _
Are you kIddIng?

15:41.240 --> 15:43.561
This is a gold digger who wants
to steal from our client.

15:43.610 --> 15:47.376
I say we go in whole hog,
we protect our client.

15:47.410 --> 15:49.378
And protect our future
relationship with her.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.071
(quietly):
We need to talk.

15:55.350 --> 15:57.341
You have until Friday.

15:59.150 --> 16:01.118
I have...?

16:01.160 --> 16:03.185
No. I have two weeks.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.619
Diane and Will are deciding
between you and Cary on Friday.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.218
Where did you hear that?

16:09.160 --> 16:11.196
Cary was going door to door
with equity partners,

16:11.230 --> 16:12.390
lining up support.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.739
He heard _it
from your aSSIstant.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.333
My guess is
he's phoning in on accounts,

16:18.370 --> 16:20.270
loading up
on receivables.

16:20.310 --> 16:22.175
How are you with Will?

16:23.250 --> 16:24.444
I don't know.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.072
What happened?

16:26.110 --> 16:27.338
I don't know.

16:27.380 --> 16:29.268
You do know.
You just don't want to say.

16:29.320 --> 16:30.514
Did you sleep with him?

16:33.090 --> 16:34.057
No.

16:34.090 --> 16:36.251
So that's the problem:
you didn't sleep with him?

16:36.290 --> 16:39.350
No. We talked.

16:39.390 --> 16:41.756
We had...

16:41.800 --> 16:43.267
a moment.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.188
And you shut it down?

16:46.230 --> 16:48.232
He did, too.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.502
Okay.

16:51.540 --> 16:54.100
You have three problems.

16:54.140 --> 16:56.028
Cary's a good finisher.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.377
He got a head start.

16:57.410 --> 17:00.641
And Will is gonna work overtime
to appear objective.

17:00.680 --> 17:02.716
Unfairly objective.

17:02.750 --> 17:04.240
I'm...

17:04.290 --> 17:06.349
I'm just so tired of this.

17:06.390 --> 17:09.609
I know, but that's what people
like Cary count on.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.368
Talk to Diane.

17:20.400 --> 17:24.029
She wants to mentor,
so ask her to mentor.

17:25.840 --> 17:29.401
It's a bad time
to be a lawyer out there.

17:29.440 --> 17:30.668
There's no jobs.

17:30.710 --> 17:32.701
I know.

17:35.150 --> 17:37.118
Thank you, Kalinda, really.

17:37.150 --> 17:39.141
Thank you.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.489
So how did that Max Wilder info
work out for you?

17:53.540 --> 17:55.189
Well.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.162
So, what are you
doing here, Detective?

17:57.210 --> 17:59.201
I'm buying you a drink.

18:07.280 --> 18:10.317
I was, uh, 300 miles away,

18:10.350 --> 18:13.319
at Baldy Lake, fishing.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.510
It was my day off.

18:15.560 --> 18:19.223
And for some reason,
just out of the blue,

18:19.260 --> 18:21.694
I had this image of you.

18:21.730 --> 18:25.325
Don't ask me why.

18:25.370 --> 18:29.136
So I got in my car,
and I drove back here.

18:32.740 --> 18:34.503
I'm divorced.

18:34.540 --> 18:37.441
I have a kid, Owen.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.471
He's six.

18:39.510 --> 18:41.546
Am I boring you?

18:42.580 --> 18:45.344
Yeah.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.329
What am I
doing wrong?

19:08.380 --> 19:10.507
Is that your car?

19:10.550 --> 19:12.245
Yeah.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.372
Get in it.

19:13.420 --> 19:16.218
Why?

19:16.250 --> 19:18.616
Now what?

19:20.560 --> 19:23.188
300 miles?

19:23.230 --> 19:25.221
Seven hours.

19:43.910 --> 19:45.502
We would respectfully submit,
Your Honor,

19:45.550 --> 19:49.372
that in view of the timing
of Mr. Wilder's accident

19:49.420 --> 19:51.888
and the suspicious removal
of the signed

19:51.920 --> 19:55.287
last page of our
divorce agreement, clearly,

19:55.320 --> 19:58.380
Max Wilder's intention
was to be free of his ex-wife.

19:58.430 --> 19:59.579
Objection!

19:59.630 --> 20:01.518
KREUTZER:
Withdrawn. Free of the

20:01.560 --> 20:02.925
respondent.
WILL:
Your Honor,

20:02.960 --> 20:03.995
this is very simple.

20:04.030 --> 20:05.429
We're not even gonna get into

20:05.470 --> 20:06.994
_ Shaina's motives
In wantIng to unplug Max.

20:07.030 --> 20:08.429
Objection.

20:08.470 --> 20:09.994
Like I said,
it isn't pertinent.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.007
Neither is the fact
that she got him

20:11.040 --> 20:13.008
to change his will
and leave her everything.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.234
Objection!

20:14.280 --> 20:15.338
STANEK:
You gentleman

20:15.380 --> 20:17.439
see that there's
no jury here, rIght?

20:17.480 --> 20:18.845
My apologies, Your Honor.

20:18.880 --> 20:22.543
In legal terms,
wife trumps mistress.

20:22.580 --> 20:23.911
KREUTZER:
Your Honor, we would like

20:23.950 --> 20:26.510
to_ introduce a new
pIece of eVIdence.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.618
Your Honor,

20:29.660 --> 20:31.753
this is Max
Wilder Jr.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.551
Five months old.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.364
And, uh, these are the results
of his paternity test.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.733
Shaina and Max have kept
this child out of the public eye

20:41.770 --> 20:44.261
for obvious reasons.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.301
Okay.

20:46.340 --> 20:48.399
Let me see ifI
can sum thIs up.

20:48.440 --> 20:49.475
I've got the
fiance over here,

20:49.510 --> 20:52.547
who also happens to be
the mother of Mr. Wilder's

20:52.580 --> 20:53.547
sole offspring.

20:53.580 --> 20:54.444
WILL:
Your Honor, we would

20:54.480 --> 20:55.469
question this paternity...

20:55.520 --> 20:56.714
And she

20:56.750 --> 20:59.344
wants guardianship,
so that she can

20:59.390 --> 21:01.756
withdraw life support
from Mr. Wilder,

21:01.790 --> 21:04.588
in which case
she inherits his entire fortune.

21:04.630 --> 21:06.552
Then, over here,
I have the wife.

21:06.590 --> 21:09.559
She wants to maintain
Mr. Wilder's life support,

21:09.600 --> 21:12.626
in which case she is free
to spend hIs entIre fortune.

21:12.670 --> 21:13.932
KREUTZER:
Uh, I don't think

21:13.970 --> 21:16.029
it's fair to characterize...
Your Honor, we would
argue that...

21:16.070 --> 21:18.038
STAN EK:
Yes, yes, yes!

21:18.070 --> 21:21.836
Everybody has Mr. Wilder's best
interest at heart, I'm sure.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.542
So here's what
we're gonna do.

21:24.580 --> 21:27.344
The court is taking temporary
guardianship of Mr. Wilder,

21:27.380 --> 21:29.814
_and we will hear
eVIdence on hIs WIshes

21:29.850 --> 21:31.647
regarding end-of-life
decisions.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.555
Please prepare
briefs and testimony.

21:33.590 --> 21:34.955
We'll hear on it
this afternoon.

21:34.990 --> 21:36.787
(gavelbangs)

21:36.820 --> 21:39.459
Let's get into
Max's house.

21:39.490 --> 21:40.650
Dig up anything
you can--

21:40.700 --> 21:43.669
e-mails, songs, poems--
anything that points

21:43.700 --> 21:44.621
to him valuing life.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.922
Alicia...

21:46.970 --> 21:47.959
where's Kalinda?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.365
She was supposed
to be here.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.833
Phone her.

21:50.870 --> 21:52.633
Let's get her over
to Max's house.

21:52.670 --> 21:53.671
I'll try her again.

21:57.810 --> 22:00.745
JAY:
I mean, if he had a living
will, I would've known.

22:00.780 --> 22:03.613
Said he wanted to be frozen,
and we could wake him up

22:03.650 --> 22:05.618
when the technology
was available.

22:05.650 --> 22:06.810
Good, good.

22:06.850 --> 22:08.511
Stories like that
doesn't sound like someone

22:08.560 --> 22:09.709
who wants the doctor
to pull the plug.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.352
I mean, who knows,
you know?

22:11.390 --> 22:13.551
Like... like most
creatIve genIuses,

22:13.600 --> 22:16.854
his deepest convictions
changed hourly.

22:16.900 --> 22:20.028
Is there any chance he could've
downloaded a living will?

22:20.070 --> 22:21.958
From someplace
like LegalZoom?
No, no.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.661
It never would have occurred
to hIm

22:23.710 --> 22:24.802
outside of a lawyer's office.

22:24.840 --> 22:26.467
Can I get
your cell number

22:26.510 --> 22:28.774
in case I need to prep you
for testimony?

22:28.810 --> 22:29.799
Yeah, no problem.

22:29.840 --> 22:32.547
CARY:
Hey! Where you been?

22:32.580 --> 22:34.047
Does it matter?

22:34.080 --> 22:35.047
CARY:
Okay.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.685
Could you show us
Max's computer?

22:37.720 --> 22:39.483
JAY:
Yeah, this way.

22:40.890 --> 22:42.619
You all right?

22:42.660 --> 22:43.752
Yeah. You?

22:43.790 --> 22:45.587
Never better.

22:53.900 --> 22:55.663
What's that setup for?

22:55.700 --> 22:58.567
Oh, that's where Max composed.

22:58.610 --> 23:01.499
He liked to sleep and get
up with any inspiration,

23:01.540 --> 23:03.178
and shoot what
he composed.

23:03.210 --> 23:05.701
Max's computer
is in his office.

23:05.750 --> 23:07.069
_It's this room
rIght over here.

23:07.110 --> 23:08.748
(footsteps move away)

23:15.020 --> 23:16.783
Hey. Tomorrow at 1:00.

23:16.820 --> 23:17.980
Tomorrow?

23:18.030 --> 23:18.985
Vernon Jordan.

23:19.030 --> 23:20.657
He'
5
c
oming?

23:20.700 --> 23:21.997
Yes.
Definitely interested.

23:22.030 --> 23:23.156
Wants to look around.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.191
We need to close off
the empty offices.

23:25.230 --> 23:26.458
Already doing it.
And your flowers,

23:26.500 --> 23:27.569
you should get back
your flowers.

23:27.600 --> 23:28.862
Okay, let's not turn this

23:28.900 --> 23:29.992
into the inspector general.

23:31.770 --> 23:33.476
Will, do you
have a minute?

23:33.510 --> 23:35.501
I'm sorry. This isn't me.

23:35.540 --> 23:36.768
Ijust...

23:38.180 --> 23:40.648
I heard you were deciding
on Friday.

23:40.680 --> 23:44.741
That really wasn't supposed
to be circulated.

23:44.790 --> 23:45.939
I know. I just...

23:45.990 --> 23:48.185
I'm really proud of the work
I've done here.

23:48.220 --> 23:49.187
As you should be.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.154
And I wanted to make sure

23:51.190 --> 23:52.726
that you saw that.

23:55.730 --> 23:57.960
Look, Alicia, I don't know what
you're hearing,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.730
but that's all
we'll be looking at.

24:01.740 --> 24:04.163
Okay, good.

24:06.610 --> 24:09.135
You have my word.

24:09.180 --> 24:11.478
When we decide, nothing else
will enter the picture

24:11.510 --> 24:13.614
other than your work.

24:25.760 --> 24:26.784
(knocking)

24:26.830 --> 24:28.821
Diane, can I
grab a minute?

24:41.140 --> 24:42.778
Yeah, yeah, sorry, Mr. Danforth.

24:42.810 --> 24:44.698
We're trying to collect
on all accounts,

24:44.750 --> 24:46.570
and I usually have our
accounting department do it,

24:46.610 --> 24:49.113
but I thought I'd give it
the personal touch.

24:50.820 --> 24:52.617
CAROLINE:
The nurses shaved him.

24:54.020 --> 24:56.909
This is what he looked like
when I met him.

24:56.960 --> 25:01.192
My God, he was so charming.

25:02.800 --> 25:03.869
Mrs. Wilder?

25:03.900 --> 25:05.094
Excuse me. Um...

25:05.130 --> 25:07.690
is-is that his bag
from the accident?

25:07.740 --> 25:09.093
Yes.

25:09.140 --> 25:10.129
Why?

25:10.170 --> 25:11.728
I just need to check something.

25:16.780 --> 25:18.907
ALICIA:
What are you looking for?

25:20.850 --> 25:25.947
* I miss the way you used
to laugh... *

25:25.990 --> 25:27.617
Is this just before
the crash?

25:27.660 --> 25:28.809
Yeah.

25:28.860 --> 25:31.829
* The way you look at me,
crooked smile *

25:31.860 --> 25:33.020
He's drunk.

25:33.060 --> 25:34.721
No. They did a tox screen

25:34.760 --> 25:36.296
for alcohol and drugs
after the accident.

25:36.330 --> 25:37.820
He was sober.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.826
(ringtone playing)

25:39.870 --> 25:41.064
That's not sober.

25:41.100 --> 25:43.261
He's so drunk_he can't
even answer hIs phone.

25:44.770 --> 25:45.907
(knocking)

25:48.280 --> 25:49.872
So you're talking to her?

25:49.910 --> 25:51.241
Iam.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.817
Play the mentor card.

25:53.850 --> 25:55.841
Mm-hmm.

25:55.880 --> 25:58.189
One of the reasons we didn't
want this to be public knowledge

25:58.220 --> 26:01.656
is because we didn't want a lot
of last-mInute po|ItIckIng.

26:01.690 --> 26:02.918
I understand.
I just...

26:02.960 --> 26:05.554
Could you hint to me
where I stand?

26:07.930 --> 26:09.898
I like you, Alicia.

26:09.930 --> 26:13.366
I didn't start out
by liking you.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.937
And of course, you
know Will likes you.

26:15.970 --> 26:17.904
You've more than proved
yourself.

26:17.940 --> 26:19.066
But...

26:21.880 --> 26:23.768
We've never seen an economic
c|Imate lIke thIs.

26:23.810 --> 26:25.175
I second-chaired
on a lot of WInners.

26:25.210 --> 26:27.178
Yes, and so has Cary.

26:27.210 --> 26:28.871
He's had higher
billable hours,

26:28.920 --> 26:32.117
and _his receivables are_
comIng In hIgh and ImmedIate.

26:32.150 --> 26:34.789
So, I... I don't understand.
Have I lost?

26:37.790 --> 26:39.052
It's not subjective.

26:39.090 --> 26:40.921
It's who keeps
the doors open.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.097
Cary doesn't
have a family.

26:42.130 --> 26:43.893
He's in here every
night at 9:00,

26:43.930 --> 26:45.124
every morning at 8:00.

26:45.170 --> 26:46.319
Then I'll work harder.

26:46.370 --> 26:47.962
And so will Cary.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.194
I don't know
what to do.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.299
I've worked hard.

26:51.340 --> 26:55.106
You say that's not enough,
so I'll work harder.

26:55.140 --> 26:56.869
You tell me Cary can work
harder still.

26:56.910 --> 26:58.275
So what do you want?

26:58.310 --> 27:02.019
Tell me what you want,
because I can't lose this job.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.979
You're not Cary.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.383
You can never be Cary.

27:12.430 --> 27:16.651
But you don't
have to be.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.019
I don't understand.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.219
Your name,

27:19.270 --> 27:21.363
your connections.

27:21.400 --> 27:24.904
You've been
reluctant to...

27:24.940 --> 27:27.408
use them.

27:27.440 --> 27:30.102
You want me_
to use my connectIons?

27:31.410 --> 27:34.015
I want you to want the job.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.022
(sniffles)

27:53.070 --> 27:54.958
(tears out check)

28:12.020 --> 28:13.851
(inhales sharply)

28:14.760 --> 28:15.988
I'm sorry, Mom.

28:16.020 --> 28:20.389
No... Why?
What's wrong?

28:20.430 --> 28:22.489
I found out about Becca...

28:22.530 --> 28:24.464
the things she was saying
about you.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.161
I'm sorry.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.269
Oh, honey.

28:27.300 --> 28:29.791
We broke up.

28:31.510 --> 28:33.364
(sniffles)

28:35.010 --> 28:37.069
Please don't be sad.

28:38.080 --> 28:40.878
It's-It's not about you.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.138
Dad's gonna be fine.

28:44.190 --> 28:48.183
(sniffles)
I know. It's not us.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.222
Are we gonna be okay?

28:58.300 --> 29:00.393
Yeah.

29:00.430 --> 29:02.034
I love you.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.960
You're a good mom.

29:06.010 --> 29:07.898
(chuckles)

29:23.220 --> 29:24.050
ALICIA:
I like to work.

29:24.090 --> 29:26.854
I like to work
at Lockhart, Gardner.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.027
I hear you're good at it.

29:28.060 --> 29:30.028
I think I am.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.062
What's wrong, Alicia?

29:32.100 --> 29:36.366
Do any of your clients
want to change law firms?

29:36.400 --> 29:39.062
Do any of my clients...?

29:40.440 --> 29:43.375
Do they want to change
to your law firm?

29:43.410 --> 29:46.072
Yes.

29:46.110 --> 29:48.374
I can ask.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.809
Is-Is there some reason
I'm askIng?

29:50.850 --> 29:52.317
Because we're a good ﬁrm.

29:52.350 --> 29:54.989
(laughs)

29:55.020 --> 29:57.921
Okay, I can arrange a few calls.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.825
Maybe next week?

29:59.860 --> 30:02.328
Or maybe not next week.

30:02.360 --> 30:05.158
What kind of timeline
are we talking here?
Fnday.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.963
Fnday?!

30:07.000 --> 30:08.934
For a call or...?

30:08.970 --> 30:10.369
This was stupid.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gold. I...

30:10.400 --> 30:12.402
No, Alicia, stop.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.408
What's going on?

30:14.440 --> 30:15.600
Talk to me.

30:15.640 --> 30:16.902
No, it's my own thing.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.874
No, it's not
your own thing.

30:18.910 --> 30:21.174
I know I don't seem like the
warm and understanding type,

30:21.220 --> 30:24.189
but this is my warm
and understanding face.

30:26.590 --> 30:29.411
I'm in competition with
another junior associate.

30:29.460 --> 30:30.256
And?

30:32.560 --> 30:35.597
You're worried
you're gonna get laId off.

30:35.630 --> 30:37.154
Okay, I can hire

30:37.200 --> 30:39.122
the guy away,
and then dump him.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.967
No, no.
No, I do it all the time.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.195
Just offer them massive salary,
and then when they get here--

30:43.240 --> 30:44.229
Oop, the position's gone.

30:44.270 --> 30:45.430
No, please.

30:45.470 --> 30:49.577
Uh... It was wrong
for me to come here.

30:49.610 --> 30:51.077
I don't want
to do this.

30:51.110 --> 30:53.169
I'm not this person.

30:53.210 --> 30:56.043
Mrs. Florrick,
ifI know one thing in life,

30:56.080 --> 30:58.048
it's that everybody
is that person.

30:59.990 --> 31:01.958
Let me make a few calls, okay?

31:01.990 --> 31:03.514
Fnday?

31:06.190 --> 31:08.090
Hey, I'm just making the calls.

31:08.130 --> 31:10.052
You get the client,
it's your client,

31:10.100 --> 31:12.068
Okay?

31:15.170 --> 31:16.637
Thank you.

31:16.670 --> 31:19.104
Hey, we're like
family, right?

31:27.010 --> 31:29.979
CAROLINE:
I guess I can't let go.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.988
When Max and I were in rehab...

31:36.190 --> 31:40.149
...there was this 12-step quote
we used to say,

31:40.190 --> 31:42.988
(voice breaking): "Don't quit
before the miracle happens."

31:45.400 --> 31:47.197
And they say
that it's a million-to-one shot,

31:47.230 --> 31:51.269
but Max's life,

31:51.310 --> 31:55.599
becoming who he was...

31:55.640 --> 31:59.246
that was
a million-to-one shot.

32:02.450 --> 32:04.918
Max loved life.

32:06.390 --> 32:09.109
He loved action.

32:11.090 --> 32:15.049
He was going to slqdive
on his 80th birthday.

32:15.100 --> 32:18.092
So I know for a fact

32:18.130 --> 32:20.223
that he would never want this.

32:24.640 --> 32:27.200
(voice breaking):
I'm sorry,

32:27.240 --> 32:30.129
but he's gone.

32:32.710 --> 32:34.018
Caroline...

32:35.550 --> 32:38.246
I know we both love him,

32:38.290 --> 32:40.542
but he's...

32:43.360 --> 32:47.057
This is torturing him.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.092
(rhythm and blues playing)

32:59.370 --> 33:01.031
Is that the tox report?

33:01.080 --> 33:03.230
Yep.
Hmm.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.145
You're not going to let
me see it, are you?

33:05.180 --> 33:07.148
I'm thinking about it.

33:10.050 --> 33:11.540
(clears throat)

33:11.590 --> 33:14.115
I had him checked
for drugs and alcohol.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.252
But they already...

33:15.290 --> 33:16.211
When they didn't
find anything,

33:16.260 --> 33:18.558
I had them check for
other foreign substances.

33:18.590 --> 33:21.354
Mr. Wilder ingested
ethylene glycol.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.322
Antifreeze.

33:23.360 --> 33:26.158
That's why
the drunken appearance.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.361
We're opening up
a murder investigation

33:28.400 --> 33:29.765
with your client
as the prime suspect.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.360
Why?

33:32.410 --> 33:35.231
A $40 million motive,
for one thing.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.406
Great.

33:37.540 --> 33:38.677
Where's the rest?

33:40.310 --> 33:42.540
Why aren't you
answering my calls?

33:42.580 --> 33:45.083
Because I'm in a relationship.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.042
I don't believe you.
Believe me.

33:47.090 --> 33:49.411
Not with that kiss.

33:51.390 --> 33:55.326
Look, I know you have
vulnerability issues.

33:55.360 --> 33:56.554
(scoffs)

33:56.600 --> 33:58.568
I don't want
to cuddle with you.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.329
Ijust...

34:10.310 --> 34:12.346
That's all.

34:12.380 --> 34:14.541
Purely recreational.

34:14.580 --> 34:18.118
You go to somebody else
for emotional validation.

34:22.220 --> 34:24.256
Drink your drink,
pay the bill,

34:24.290 --> 34:26.679
then follow me out.

34:51.850 --> 34:55.308
DAVID:
Toxicology report pinpoints
the poisoning as happening

34:55.360 --> 34:56.588
between 10:00 am.
and noon,

34:56.620 --> 34:58.429
when Max
was at the house.

34:58.460 --> 35:01.395
CAROLINE:
But I wasn't at
Max's house.

35:01.430 --> 35:03.159
Do you have any proof?

35:03.200 --> 35:05.191
That was just before
you went to court.

35:05.230 --> 35:07.391
I don't know.
I mean, I-I guess so.

35:07.430 --> 35:09.136
I'm trying to think.

35:09.170 --> 35:11.309
ALICIA:
The police believe they've
established motive, Caroline.

35:11.340 --> 35:12.762
Now they're trying
to establish access

35:12.810 --> 35:14.300
by putting you
at the house.

35:14.340 --> 35:15.739
Could Shaina
have been there?

35:15.780 --> 35:17.475
Yeah, I mean, she has a key,

35:17.510 --> 35:18.408
so I guess it's possible.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.613
Do you really think
that they suspect me?

35:21.650 --> 35:23.413
Yeah.

35:25.920 --> 35:26.909
KALIN DA:
Who's that?

35:26.950 --> 35:29.555
It's our savior.

35:30.820 --> 35:31.821
So, Mr. Jordan...

35:31.860 --> 35:33.851
Vernon, please.

35:33.890 --> 35:36.893
So, Vernon, you've been
looking us over, I hear.

35:36.930 --> 35:39.228
That's right.
I love Chicago.

35:39.270 --> 35:42.194
Summers of '57, '58,
I drove the city bus.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.491
(laughs):
Really?

35:43.540 --> 35:44.939
WILL:
Best buses in the world.

35:44.970 --> 35:47.803
My first
big city experience.

35:47.840 --> 35:51.742
Well, I don't think
we'd be speaking out of turn

35:51.780 --> 35:54.510
to say we're happy
to be looked over.

35:54.550 --> 35:57.872
We're hoping you can
open some doors for
us to Washington.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.888
Well, it's a new economy.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.808
We all have to diversify.

36:01.860 --> 36:04.681
So after your tire-kicking,
what do you think, Vernon?

36:04.730 --> 36:07.824
I think the firm
lacks focus.

36:07.860 --> 36:10.954
It seems as if you're
taking cases on a whim.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.763
I think you've nailed
our vulnerability.

36:12.800 --> 36:15.689
More passion sometimes
than sense.

36:15.740 --> 36:17.765
Will and I know that

36:17.800 --> 36:19.358
we need a referee.

36:19.410 --> 36:21.605
So we would be willing
to offer a three-way split.

36:22.640 --> 36:25.541
I-I'm sorry, I thought...

36:25.580 --> 36:27.468
I want to buy you out.

36:30.550 --> 36:33.212
Is that not what you want?

36:39.690 --> 36:41.794
Well, that didn't go well.

36:41.830 --> 36:43.388
Who would have thought

36:43.430 --> 36:45.864
_our firm means more
WIthout us than WIth us?

36:47.000 --> 36:50.197
Really undercuts
one's conﬁdence.

36:52.940 --> 36:54.305
Well...

36:54.340 --> 36:57.229
it's time to make
some tough deCISIons.

37:05.750 --> 37:07.684
(ringtone playing on video)

37:11.730 --> 37:14.722
(ringtone continues)

37:15.860 --> 37:17.657
(ringtone stops)

37:17.700 --> 37:18.826
TONY:
And you weren't here?

37:18.870 --> 37:20.019
No.

37:20.070 --> 37:22.891
You never went
to hIs house?

37:22.940 --> 37:24.305
That day? No.

37:24.340 --> 37:26.501
Who has keys to his house?

37:26.540 --> 37:28.735
Well, I'm not
completely sure.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.338
Jay?

37:30.380 --> 37:32.598
Uh, as far
as I remember,

37:32.650 --> 37:35.016
Max, Shaina
and the housekeeper.

37:35.050 --> 37:36.870
And Mrs. Wilder, too?

37:36.920 --> 37:38.478
Well, yes.

37:38.520 --> 37:40.511
When was the last time
you saw Max?

37:40.550 --> 37:42.518
JAY:
Uh, the night before.

37:42.560 --> 37:45.028
And he seemed
in a good mood, you know.

37:45.060 --> 37:46.357
Um, looking forward
to his wedding.

37:46.390 --> 37:47.926
Can I have his
business card.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.097
Whose?
HIs.

37:49.130 --> 37:51.519
Why?
TONY:
The housekeeper--
what are her hours?

37:51.570 --> 37:52.969
JAY:
I don't know.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.490
I could get
her number for you.

37:54.540 --> 37:56.565
Max would just let anybody in?

37:56.600 --> 37:57.965
Yes.

37:58.000 --> 38:02.039
(ringtone playing loudly)

38:02.080 --> 38:04.469
Oh, sorry, sorry.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.809
Hello.

38:07.850 --> 38:10.011
Hello.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.451
So we're all set.

38:16.490 --> 38:18.629
My client receives a
million a year for life.

38:18.660 --> 38:20.480
My client gets
the rest of the estate,

38:20.530 --> 38:21.895
and full guardianship.

38:21.930 --> 38:23.488
Of a comatose patient.

38:23.530 --> 38:24.895
It's what she wants.

38:24.930 --> 38:27.069
So you're the reason
Jay did it.

38:27.100 --> 38:29.034
Well, I'm not the reason,

38:29.070 --> 38:32.039
but Max and Shaina were
plannIng to change the WIN

38:32.070 --> 38:33.435
after they got married.

38:33.470 --> 38:35.529
Shaina wanted
to remove Jay.

38:35.580 --> 38:38.674
Ah, money. Dependable money.

38:38.710 --> 38:40.507
Pleasure doing business
with you.
You, too.

38:41.950 --> 38:43.110
Alicia, Cary.

38:43.150 --> 38:45.311
Will and Diane
want to see you.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.758
Thank you, Courtney.
We'll be right up.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.729
It's weird, huh?

38:56.760 --> 39:00.025
It's like a date
with the executioner.

39:00.070 --> 39:02.459
Nice working with you.

39:02.500 --> 39:03.592
You, too.

39:03.640 --> 39:05.062
You're a good lawyer.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.440
Do you know what you'll do
if it goes against you?

39:20.490 --> 39:21.559
No.

39:21.590 --> 39:22.682
You?

39:22.720 --> 39:23.914
No idea.

39:23.960 --> 39:28.727
I hear it's always
the first one called in.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.421
They're the one
who gets fired.

39:30.460 --> 39:32.098
I really didn't
need to know that.

39:32.130 --> 39:33.995
Sorry.

39:55.160 --> 39:58.084
My clients kept asking,
ifI was so high

39:58.120 --> 40:00.725
on your firm, why wasn't
I bringing my business here?

40:00.760 --> 40:03.524
And I didn't want to
appear hypocritical.

40:03.560 --> 40:05.164
Mr. Gold...

40:05.200 --> 40:06.167
Eli.

40:06.200 --> 40:09.067
Eli, you...

40:09.100 --> 40:10.590
Thank you.

40:10.640 --> 40:13.404
And, hey,
I hear it's a good firm.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.138
And we'll have to talk.

40:16.180 --> 40:18.000
About?

40:18.040 --> 40:20.645
Your husband's campaign.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.849
(door opening)

40:33.130 --> 40:35.189
Alicia, would you
come in, please?

40:45.740 --> 40:47.139
(lock clicks)

40:51.080 --> 40:54.675
We don't mean to draw this out
any longer than we have to.

40:56.250 --> 40:57.740
Good job, Alicia.

40:57.780 --> 40:59.589
WILL:
Very good job.

40:59.620 --> 41:01.144
(sighs)

41:01.190 --> 41:03.078
Thanks for going
all-out this year.
It's been quite a ride.

41:03.120 --> 41:05.122
DIANE:
And we're not out
of the woods yet.

41:05.160 --> 41:06.627
We have a lot of trimming to do,

41:06.660 --> 41:08.218
so we're all going to have
to work harder.

41:08.260 --> 41:10.057
WILL:
Do more with less.
I'm ready.

41:10.100 --> 41:11.590
DIANE:
We know you are,

41:11.630 --> 41:13.120
and, uh, thanks for
listening the other day.

41:13.170 --> 41:14.990
You heard us.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.268
That's all we needed to know.

41:16.300 --> 41:19.064
No; thank you.

41:38.790 --> 41:39.927
You okay?

41:39.960 --> 41:42.258
Yes.

41:42.300 --> 41:44.666
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be fine.

41:46.700 --> 41:48.759
Cary, do you
have a minute?

41:48.800 --> 41:50.665
Yes.

42:06.120 --> 42:08.088
We're sorry.

42:09.820 --> 42:13.028
DIANE:
You were great, Cary.

42:13.060 --> 42:15.051
And if we weren't
in this situation--

42:15.100 --> 42:18.592
this financial situation--
we would want you both.

42:18.630 --> 42:19.597
I understand.

42:19.630 --> 42:21.939
We can make a few calls
for you, if you'd like.

42:21.970 --> 42:25.906
And we would give you
unqualified references.
Thank you.

42:28.310 --> 42:30.198
Do you have any questions?

42:30.240 --> 42:33.175
No. I get it.
