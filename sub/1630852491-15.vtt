- Can I help you?
- Yeah, um, I'm looking for a suit.

00:05.591 --> 00:07.609
Come on, Jack, just
say it like it is.

00:07.693 --> 00:09.047
We both know that
I wasn't there

00:09.132 --> 00:11.203
for Andy and Amber
like I should have been.

00:11.331 --> 00:14.179
You know, after your mother
and I split,

00:14.578 --> 00:16.898
I promised my best friend
and myself that

00:17.137 --> 00:19.570
I would fight to keep
you kids in my life.

00:19.655 --> 00:22.453
And for a long time, I tried.

00:22.632 --> 00:26.528
In heartbreak, ten years
after her husband

00:26.612 --> 00:28.257
and my best friend died,

00:28.414 --> 00:29.960
Rebecca and I found each other.

00:30.045 --> 00:32.034
Now, you don't have to be
happy for us,

00:32.119 --> 00:35.515
but we're not gonna apologize
for being together.

00:35.630 --> 00:38.804
Let's toast to your mother
not calling you William.

the blood pressure

03:01.558 --> 03:02.718

03:02.802 --> 03:04.911
- MIGUEL: Okay.
- How's the new hip treating you

03:04.996 --> 03:06.614
in the couple of months
since the wedding?

03:06.699 --> 03:08.215
MIGUEL:
Oh, the hip's great, thank you.

03:08.300 --> 03:10.058
DOCTOR: What about fatigue?
Now, you mentioned feeling

03:10.142 --> 03:12.494
shortness of breath
during exercise?

03:12.578 --> 03:13.793
MIGUEL:
Um...

03:14.394 --> 03:15.762
I think I'd like to set you up

03:15.847 --> 03:17.950
- for a stress test.
- I don't have time

03:18.035 --> 03:19.122
- for that, Doc, I'm sorry.
- You're not

03:19.206 --> 03:21.386
a young man
anymore, Mr. Rivas, no.

03:21.471 --> 03:23.527
Our bodies don't recover
the way they used to.

03:23.612 --> 03:25.503
You've got to get some rest.

04:10.882 --> 04:12.417
Bon appétit.

04:16.666 --> 04:19.331
All right, keep that tension
and raise it above your head.

04:19.652 --> 04:21.041
There you go, honey.

04:21.127 --> 04:22.798
Keep the tension on

04:47.172 --> 04:50.692
I-I think it's okay.
We've got it.

04:50.777 --> 04:52.372
- We're almost done here anyway.
- Mm-hmm.

04:52.457 --> 04:53.809
I'll go make sure
her meds are sorted.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.650
I already took care of that
as well.

04:55.735 --> 04:57.386

07:36.138 --> 07:37.936
I got something for you.

07:38.384 --> 07:42.967
I caught a foul ball off
Mazeroski the other day.

07:45.067 --> 07:47.452
You been to a game yet?

07:48.154 --> 07:51.139

Well, I won't pretend
that's not helpful.

09:29.697 --> 09:33.402
A lot of our new guys on site
barely speak a word of English.

09:33.487 --> 09:34.957

What'd you do to your hair?

10:25.875 --> 10:27.793
You don't like it?
Oh, by the way,

10:27.877 --> 10:30.155
I brought some, uh, wine.
It's, uh, good stuff.

10:30.240 --> 10:32.250
No wine. It's Christmas Eve,

10:32.335 --> 10:33.844
and we're having coquito.

10:36.877 --> 10:39.946
- It's good to see you, mijo.
- Good to see you, too, Papi.

10:40.171 --> 10:42.051

- Yeah, well...

10:42.136 --> 10:43.322

10:43.406 --> 10:44.457
- Oh, I love it.
- Yeah?

10:44.542 --> 10:45.822
Yeah, uh, it's very challenging,

10:46.462 --> 10:49.014
but it also pays very well.

10:49.098 --> 10:51.317
I just got a new car.
A Chevy El Camino.

10:51.947 --> 10:53.623
What do I tell you
about saving?

10:59.008 --> 11:01.303
I know, Papi, I know.

11:01.446 --> 11:02.734
Come on, Papi,
you know how it is.

11:02.818 --> 11:04.135

11:04.220 --> 11:06.706
Well, how it is sure isn't
how it used to be.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.026
- I will toast to that. Salud.

Gabi's busy making pasteles,
but she says Merry Christmas.

11:13.896 --> 11:14.655
Mm.

11:14.740 --> 11:16.691
She also says she misses
your curly hair.

11:16.776 --> 11:18.579
Well, I'm not trying to look

11:22.443 --> 11:23.975

11:24.767 --> 11:28.186

- Mm.

11:28.319 --> 11:30.225
You know, Mami,
I really wish that you would

11:30.310 --> 11:33.697

take care of Aunt Gabi.

11:33.821 --> 11:35.459
She's got me.
Save your money.

11:35.544 --> 11:37.229
Mami, I have plenty of money.
Don't worry about it.

11:37.313 --> 11:38.313
Just let me help you.

11:42.560 --> 11:45.069
- You have something to say, Papi?
- To who?

11:45.243 --> 11:47.061
You?

11:47.246 --> 11:49.967
The guy with the slick hair,
the slick car...

11:52.819 --> 11:54.436
What are you talking about?

11:57.047 --> 11:58.582
Que no...

12:12.419 --> 12:14.778
You-you split me in half
when you moved us here,

12:14.863 --> 12:16.482
and now I'm finally
figuring out, and what,

12:16.566 --> 12:18.601
you want me to struggle
like you?

12:20.614 --> 12:22.411
Why is it so hard for you
to watch me

12:22.496 --> 12:24.580
make something of myself
in this place?

12:24.665 --> 12:26.534
In this place that
you brought us to?

12:44.034 --> 12:45.840
I will.

12:46.925 --> 12:48.528
Enjoy the wine, Mami.

12:48.636 --> 12:49.848
I'm gonna go.

Uh... you have been hogging
my guy.

13:33.770 --> 13:35.454
In fact, he's been
flaking on me so much

13:35.539 --> 13:37.362
to spend time with you that
I started calling him Dandruff.

13:37.446 --> 13:39.080
(Jack and Miguel laugh)

13:39.185 --> 13:41.869
- On account of all the flaking.
- Hilarious.

Oh, you should talk.
Look at you.

27:51.734 --> 27:53.852
Interesting. You're...
You live here.

27:53.937 --> 27:55.768

- I do.

Rebecca, um...

28:13.579 --> 28:16.154
I spent the last eight years
wondering

28:16.239 --> 28:18.375
if I made the right decision.

28:19.759 --> 28:23.858
I have replayed it over
and over in my head,

28:23.980 --> 28:25.648
and, um...

28:27.109 --> 28:28.644
I had to leave.

28:29.496 --> 28:32.999
I never felt like I belonged.

28:34.585 --> 28:38.805
Puerto Rican or American.
Spanish or English.

28:38.890 --> 28:40.908
I've just...

28:41.030 --> 28:44.634
I've never felt at home
anywhere.

28:46.450 --> 28:49.102
And if I'm being honest,

28:49.187 --> 28:52.936
the first time that
I ever felt homesick in my life

28:53.919 --> 28:56.404
was when I left you
on that porch.

28:58.815 --> 29:00.799
And I'm not really...

29:00.946 --> 29:04.350
sure how to explain it.

REBECCA:
Hmm.

29:31.804 --> 29:34.022
You should have your company
open up a branch

29:34.106 --> 29:35.691
- here in Pittsburgh.
- (laughs)

29:35.775 --> 29:39.194
Okay. Uh, well,
it would save on airfare.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.696
- Uh-huh.
- I could put a down payment on a house

29:41.781 --> 29:43.634

these past few months.

29:43.718 --> 29:45.781

- Actually,

29:45.998 --> 29:47.813

retirement packages

29:47.898 --> 29:49.404

- What? (Gasps)

29:49.488 --> 29:50.605

what he'd think about all this.

30:28.327 --> 30:32.008
I've wondered, too. Obviously.

30:32.093 --> 30:35.250

the amount of time I've spent...

30:35.427 --> 30:37.820
wondering about all of this...

30:42.641 --> 30:43.943
And?

30:47.513 --> 30:51.140
I think he would want
what's best for us.

30:52.208 --> 30:54.176

31:29.210 --> 31:30.578
that you're back
over dinner.

31:30.663 --> 31:31.907
- And then over dessert, we can wait.

After Tess was born,

MIGUEL: Uh, well, what she means
by "hooked up"

32:10.149 --> 32:11.439
is that we, that we met up.

32:11.524 --> 32:12.478
We connected.

- Right, honey? Yeah.
- REBECCA: Yeah.

Slept together.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.186
Oh, no.

32:18.270 --> 32:21.243
No, no. That didn't start
until much more recently.

you guys are so surprised.

- Didn't I say, baby?
- She did.

I mean, I said, "We haven't seen
the last of Migs."

32:29.188 --> 32:30.181
And then I was like,

32:30.266 --> 32:32.720
"Why does your mom have
Fourth of July plans?

32:32.805 --> 32:34.627

Fourth of July plans."
