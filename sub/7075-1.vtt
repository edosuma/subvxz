00:43.648 --> 00:47.262
to another fall semester
at Greendale!

00:47.329 --> 00:50.573
It's time for clean slates
and fresh starts.

00:50.641 --> 00:53.417
Celebrate
your fresh start tonight

00:53.485 --> 00:56.158
at the fresh start dance
in the cafeteria.

00:56.228 --> 00:58.468
The same cafeteria
where Britta Perry

00:58.536 --> 01:00.609
publicly professed her love
to Jeff Winger

01:00.676 --> 01:02.046
who then walked out on her.

01:02.113 --> 01:03.418
Unforgettable!

01:03.486 --> 01:07.065
Plus, free punch
and fresh start cookies tonight

01:07.132 --> 01:09.541
at the fresh start dance!

01:09.609 --> 01:11.212
Look at us...
Living together,

01:11.282 --> 01:12.752
driving to school together.

01:12.820 --> 01:15.394
I know.
We're like Batman and shaft.

01:15.462 --> 01:18.002
Batman actually had a guy.
His name was Robin.

01:18.069 --> 01:19.841
He rode around with him.

01:19.909 --> 01:22.249
Troy, Batman's friend
didn't have to be Robin.

01:22.319 --> 01:24.524
It could have been shaft,
dolemite...

01:24.592 --> 01:26.531
Leroy brown.

01:26.598 --> 01:28.971
Don't let society
limit your people.

01:29.039 --> 01:30.174
Giggles.

01:30.242 --> 01:32.048
Batman and shaft.
Wow!

01:32.116 --> 01:33.454
You're reading Troy's
Twitter page

01:33.522 --> 01:34.891
where he posts everything
Pierce says?

01:34.959 --> 01:37.434
Yeah! "Oldwhitemansays"?
It's hilarious.

01:37.502 --> 01:38.804
Aah!

01:40.344 --> 01:42.415
Hello, honey!

01:42.483 --> 01:43.918
- I like your hair.
- Oh, thank you, Abed.

01:43.986 --> 01:46.256
- You're welcome.
- Jeffrey. Hello!

01:46.325 --> 01:48.596
- Hey! How was your summer?
- Lived with you.

01:48.664 --> 01:49.766
Oh, yeah.

01:55.517 --> 01:58.022
Okay.

01:58.090 --> 02:00.428
So...Are you guys ready
for whatever...

02:00.496 --> 02:01.560
Anthropology is?

02:01.628 --> 02:03.228
We should wait for Britta.

02:03.295 --> 02:04.796
Do we know
if she's coming back?

02:04.864 --> 02:06.564
She never returned
any of my calls or emails.

02:06.632 --> 02:08.032
Me neither.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.202
It's not gonna be
the same without her.

02:10.270 --> 02:11.806
Oh...

02:14.647 --> 02:16.551
<i>Hey, did you guys see
toy story 3?</i>

02:16.619 --> 02:18.187
<i>- Yes!
- Oh, I love toy story 3!</i>

02:19.659 --> 02:20.927
- Hey!
- Aah!

02:22.265 --> 02:23.934
<i>- Hey!
- Hey, toy story... Britta!</i>

02:25.773 --> 02:26.841
Okay. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

02:26.909 --> 02:29.681
I made an ass of myself
and Jeff at that dance.

02:29.749 --> 02:31.485
I was just caught up
in a competition

02:31.553 --> 02:33.088
with his turd
of an ex-girlfriend,

02:33.156 --> 02:35.326
and I wish I could erase
the entire night,

02:35.395 --> 02:36.930
and I owe you an apology.

02:36.998 --> 02:38.233
I accept.

02:38.300 --> 02:40.304
Oh, sweetie,
you don't owe us anything,

02:40.371 --> 02:42.074
and you don't have to hide
from us.

02:42.142 --> 02:43.912
<i>You?
I'm hiding from them.</i>

02:43.980 --> 02:46.216
It's like high school
all over again.

02:46.284 --> 02:48.287
Psycho Britta,
the walking freak show

02:48.355 --> 02:51.428
<i>for every Barbie
with a cosmo subscription.</i>

02:51.496 --> 02:52.964
Look, I don't mean
to be a tool,

02:53.032 --> 02:54.835
but you embarrassed me
that night too,

02:54.903 --> 02:56.104
so call it karma.

02:56.172 --> 02:57.608
Oh, boy.

02:57.676 --> 03:00.146
<i>I hope I'm not around
when you do mean to be a tool.</i>

03:00.213 --> 03:02.485
Let's just put this behind us

03:02.552 --> 03:04.154
and just walk to class, okay?

03:04.222 --> 03:06.325
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:09.198 --> 03:12.136
- You're Britta Perry?
- Yeah. What's it to you?

03:12.203 --> 03:13.770
You are the...Coolest!

03:14.905 --> 03:16.506
Right. Um...

03:16.573 --> 03:17.874
At what, exactly?

03:17.941 --> 03:19.475
Being fearless!

03:19.543 --> 03:21.677
Honest.
Speaking from your heart.

03:21.745 --> 03:24.012
"Jeff Winger, I love you."

03:24.080 --> 03:25.513
Right. Um...

03:25.581 --> 03:27.482
My heart may have overstated...

03:27.550 --> 03:29.617
- do you sign stuff?
- Now and again.

03:29.685 --> 03:30.818
Awesome.

03:30.886 --> 03:32.853
I don't like
where that's going.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.421
I know. Right?

03:38.292 --> 03:41.227
Um...Annie, do you remember
the little talk we had?

03:41.295 --> 03:43.462
- The one about discretion?
- Yes. Stop that.

03:43.530 --> 03:46.632
Look, we agreed that you and I
kissing was a mistake.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.634
And if anyone were
to find out about it,

03:48.702 --> 03:50.035
I would be tarred, feathered,

03:50.103 --> 03:51.606
and put on one of those websites
people check

03:51.673 --> 03:53.107
when they're buying a house.

03:53.175 --> 03:54.308
It's forgotten, Jeff!

03:54.376 --> 03:56.978
Jeez, I'm not some
love-struck teenybopper!

03:57.045 --> 03:58.179
But you should know,
we didn't just kiss.

03:58.246 --> 03:59.613
We technically frenched.

03:59.681 --> 04:02.182
I checked the make-out meter

04:02.250 --> 04:05.051

Oh, wait.
I guess it's not senor anymore.

04:43.754 --> 04:45.721
What should we call you?
Student Chang?

04:45.788 --> 04:47.521
Two credits into

Okay. How 'bout not

Why are you guys in this class?

04:52.225 --> 04:54.059
Oh. We chose it together.

04:54.126 --> 04:56.060
The real question is...
Why are you in it?

04:56.128 --> 04:58.529
Oh! You missed us?

04:58.596 --> 05:00.163

05:07.603 --> 05:09.336
Ugh.

05:17.678 --> 05:18.845
I don't get it.

05:18.913 --> 05:20.546
- Well, star-burns
has grown reliant

05:20.614 --> 05:22.314
on his star-shaped sideburns

05:22.382 --> 05:24.716
but still craves identity
beyond them, so he added a hat.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.183
- . What's up
with Britta-mania?

05:26.251 --> 05:27.618
Oh. Oh, that's even
simpler.

05:27.686 --> 05:35.116
In the eyes of the public,
Britta put herself out there.

05:35.184 --> 05:36.910
Hey, Jeff, do you have
any hillbilly cousins?

05:36.977 --> 05:38.747
- I wish. Why?
- What about a wealthy uncle?

05:38.814 --> 05:39.898
Or an old drinking buddy

05:39.966 --> 05:41.618
that may or may not have
had a sex change?

05:41.671 --> 05:43.590
Why are you mining my life
for classic sitcom scenarios?

05:43.642 --> 05:45.460
I guess I'm just excited
about the new year,

05:45.528 --> 05:46.863
looking for ways
to improve things.

05:46.931 --> 05:48.282
I'm hoping we can move away

05:48.350 --> 05:49.919
from the soapy
relationshipy stuff

05:49.987 --> 05:52.157
and into bigger, fast-paced,
self-contained escapades.

05:52.225 --> 05:53.627
What is it, exactly,

05:53.695 --> 05:55.965
that separates man from animal?

05:56.033 --> 05:57.402
Divorce?

Like this blowgun I used

06:10.758 --> 06:13.580
to hunt monkeys
with the korubo in the Amazon.

06:13.647 --> 06:16.136
My name
is Professor June Bauer,

06:16.203 --> 06:17.221
and this semester,

06:17.289 --> 06:18.607
I will guide you
to the very threshold

06:18.675 --> 06:20.377
of your humanity,

06:20.445 --> 06:22.581
where you will lock eyes

06:22.649 --> 06:24.285
with the shrieking,
blood-drenched

06:24.353 --> 06:28.193
sister-raping beasts
from which we sprang.

06:28.260 --> 06:30.297
You will also have to make
a diorama.

06:31.784 --> 06:33.020
For your first assignment,

06:33.088 --> 06:36.076
I would like you to form tribes
of no more than eight

06:36.144 --> 06:38.766
and, if you can,
mix up the races,

06:38.833 --> 06:40.285
or you'll be surprised

06:40.353 --> 06:42.456
at how quickly
things get awkward.

06:46.295 --> 06:48.197
You know, now that Troy's
off the streets

06:48.265 --> 06:50.068
and living with me,

06:50.136 --> 06:51.972
he's learning so much
about the world.

06:52.040 --> 06:55.163
Yeah. Tell me again why
Jewish people wear yarmulkes.

06:55.215 --> 06:57.485
Half a hat.
Saves money.

06:57.553 --> 06:59.722
Thank you!

06:59.790 --> 07:03.160
"Half a hat"?
That is so offensive!

07:03.227 --> 07:05.029
I love "oldwhitemansays".

07:05.097 --> 07:07.667
Hey, find an eighth dork
for your tribe of dorks?

07:07.734 --> 07:09.703
Chang, I'm starting to think
you took anthropology

07:09.771 --> 07:11.206
because you wanna be
in our study group

07:11.273 --> 07:12.324
but are too proud to ask.

07:12.392 --> 07:14.126
What?
Keep dreaming, Winger.

07:14.193 --> 07:17.647
Would somebody with
too much pride...Do this?

07:17.715 --> 07:21.422
Current balance, $23.10.

07:21.490 --> 07:24.144
- Consider yourself Chang-ed.

07:25.564 --> 07:27.668
Some Mac and cheese, please.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.808
Sorry. Looks like your food
just walked out on ya.

07:30.876 --> 07:32.779
Same way you did Britta.

07:38.591 --> 07:40.627
Hey.
Can we talk?

07:40.695 --> 07:41.913
Oh. Now he wants to talk.

07:41.981 --> 07:43.816
No. It's fine.
I'll be right back.

07:45.721 --> 07:48.609
Man, uh...You got some
real passionate fans.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.262
Ah, it'll blow over.

07:50.314 --> 07:52.984
Would you mind, um...
Helping it blow over?

07:53.052 --> 07:55.273
My stock is kinda plummeting
around here.

07:55.341 --> 07:56.558
Oh...

07:56.626 --> 07:58.195
I don't mean
to sound like a tool,

07:58.263 --> 08:00.499
but maybe it's karma.

08:00.567 --> 08:01.785
Britta, I know you're excited

08:01.853 --> 08:03.189
to finally be popular
with women,

08:03.256 --> 08:05.492
but don't get too high
on your own drama.

08:05.560 --> 08:08.648
High on my own drama?

08:11.338 --> 08:12.489
People's champion!

08:12.556 --> 08:14.326
Sorry, man.

08:14.394 --> 08:16.531
I gotta go where the heat is.

08:16.598 --> 08:18.952
Jeff Winger, you're a jerk!

08:20.439 --> 08:22.743
She's turned every woman
on campus against me.

08:22.795 --> 08:24.046
Well, not every woman.

08:24.114 --> 08:25.984
Certainly not the one
that deserves to be with you.

08:26.051 --> 08:27.988
Annie, all women
deserve to be with me.

08:28.055 --> 08:29.607
And vice versa.
Granted.

08:29.674 --> 08:31.477
But who doesn't eventually
settle down?

08:31.545 --> 08:32.780
I don't.
And I never will.

08:32.847 --> 08:34.099
And if I did...

08:36.571 --> 08:38.924
If I did...

08:38.993 --> 08:42.049
I can beat Britta
at her own game.

08:43.135 --> 08:44.706
Oh, good.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.811
Yeah, you better take a hike!

08:46.879 --> 08:49.867
Do you know where
the cleanest bathroom is?

08:49.935 --> 08:52.890
- Teacher's lounge.
- Thank you.

08:52.958 --> 08:55.479
Don't be shy.
Come on up, have a sip.

08:55.547 --> 08:59.220
The yogi of India
swear by its restorative powers.

09:00.507 --> 09:01.858
Okay.

09:01.926 --> 09:04.714
More of my urine for me.

09:04.782 --> 09:06.651
Now for your tribe's assignment.

09:06.719 --> 09:10.558
This box contains
nine different tools,

09:10.626 --> 09:13.780
all of them important
to humanity's survival.

09:13.848 --> 09:17.421
One of them is the most
important of all.

09:17.489 --> 09:20.410
Your tribe's assignment
for tomorrow

09:20.478 --> 09:23.733
is to tell me
which tool that is.

09:23.801 --> 09:26.258
Questions?
I have a question.

09:26.326 --> 09:30.011
But not for you.
It's for Britta.

09:32.398 --> 09:33.774
Britta...

09:33.845 --> 09:35.478
I love you.

09:35.546 --> 09:38.681
- Oh!
- Oh!

09:40.316 --> 09:43.652
Now, I know this puts you in
an awkwardly powerful position,

09:43.719 --> 09:46.721
but I have to know right now,
in front of everyone...

09:46.788 --> 09:49.655
Do you love me too?
Oh!

09:51.891 --> 09:54.059
More than anything
in the world.

09:54.126 --> 09:55.826
Oh ho oh!

09:55.894 --> 09:58.229
Really.

09:58.296 --> 10:00.764
- Yeah.
- So...

10:00.831 --> 10:04.100
It begins...
Hmm.

10:04.168 --> 10:08.137
The greatest relationship
ever known.

10:13.009 --> 10:14.075
Eh!

10:17.913 --> 10:19.413
Oh!

10:19.481 --> 10:22.749
This is making me sick.

10:27.134 --> 10:28.232
I'm gonna love you forever.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.100
Good.
I'm gonna love you forever.

10:30.168 --> 10:31.802
- I don't believe you.
- Oh!

10:31.869 --> 10:33.503
Why?
Don't you want me to?

10:33.571 --> 10:36.506
No, I do.
Bring it.

10:36.573 --> 10:38.740
Doesn't it make you wanna cry?

10:38.808 --> 10:41.309
Something like that.
'Scuse me.

10:41.377 --> 10:43.611
I downloaded a song
that makes me think of you.

10:43.679 --> 10:46.280
Let's listen to it,
each using one earbud.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.684
Shirley, would you consider
spinning off with me?

10:51.752 --> 10:53.686
Just riffing, but we could open
a hair salon together.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.456
Well, I don't understand.
Is this you being meta?

10:56.523 --> 10:58.357
I wanted to come out of
the gate having adventures,

10:58.425 --> 11:00.693
like paintball.
This is boring.

11:00.760 --> 11:01.994
Well, I think
that's selfish, Abed.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.662
If you were a friend
to Jeff and Britta,

11:03.730 --> 11:06.330
you would see their relationship
as an adventure.

11:06.398 --> 11:07.865
I hadn't thought
about it that way.

11:07.933 --> 11:09.900
Oh, look at how they walk!

11:13.638 --> 11:15.772
Clearly, the most important
tool to a tribe's survival

11:15.839 --> 11:17.840
is here... the cross,
representing christianity.

11:17.908 --> 11:19.708
- That's an ax.
- It's an ax?

11:19.776 --> 11:21.010
Maybe it's the telescope.

11:21.077 --> 11:22.444
You can look through it
backwards...

11:22.512 --> 11:23.678
Shrink your enemies!

11:23.746 --> 11:25.313
I'll show you the tool

11:25.380 --> 11:26.881
that's most important
to our survival.

11:26.948 --> 11:29.550
But fair warning...
it's my penis.

11:36.589 --> 11:38.990
Oldwhiteman...

11:39.058 --> 11:41.126
Sorry I'm late.
I was in my car loving Britta.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.897
I guess I just love you
too much.

11:46.965 --> 11:48.433
Not half as much as me.

11:48.501 --> 11:49.869
Oh...

11:49.936 --> 11:51.403
Jeff, do you think
you'll marry Britta?

11:51.471 --> 11:53.204
I'd like to see someone
stop me.

11:53.272 --> 11:54.705
I just peed a little.

11:54.773 --> 11:57.007
Then here.
Propose.

11:57.075 --> 11:58.075
Oh!

12:02.179 --> 12:03.579
I got it, I got it, I got it!

12:03.647 --> 12:05.881
Jeff Winger...

12:05.949 --> 12:07.249
Will you marry me?

12:07.317 --> 12:09.084
Yeah, yeah, of course.

12:09.152 --> 12:10.385
- Aah!
- Aah!

12:10.453 --> 12:12.553
Perfect.
I'll be right back.

12:12.621 --> 12:14.688
- Oh!
- Oh!

12:14.756 --> 12:16.289
Thank the lord
you're getting married!

12:16.357 --> 12:17.590
I was so worried
about your souls

12:17.658 --> 12:21.427
ever since you had
premarital sex on the table!

12:21.494 --> 12:23.628
- Oh!
- Aah!

12:23.696 --> 12:26.197
- Awesome!
- You told Shirley?

12:26.264 --> 12:27.798
Well, there's no need
for secrecy now!

12:27.866 --> 12:29.734
It was during
the paintball game.

12:29.801 --> 12:32.306
Was there anything
you didn't win that day?

12:32.374 --> 12:34.274
Oh!

12:34.341 --> 12:37.710
You slept with her
and then kissed me?

12:37.778 --> 12:39.044
- Oh!
- What?

12:41.747 --> 12:46.217
♪ Now they're in so deep ♪

12:46.285 --> 12:50.387
♪ you know she's such
a fool for him ♪

12:50.454 --> 12:55.626
♪ she has a ring
around her fin-ger-errr ♪

12:55.693 --> 12:57.895
♪ and Abed hired
an Irish singer ♪

12:57.962 --> 13:00.498
♪ Britta's marryin',
Britta's marryin' ♪

13:00.565 --> 13:03.400
♪ Britta's marryin'
Jeffrey Winger ♪

13:03.468 --> 13:04.568
What the hell is this?

13:04.635 --> 13:06.203
A wedding.
Episode.

13:06.270 --> 13:08.371
- Abed, there's no wedding.
- Cold feet?

13:08.439 --> 13:10.473
Talk it over with your
best man George Clooney.

13:10.541 --> 13:12.208
What's up?

13:12.275 --> 13:13.742
He's a George Clooney
impersonator,

13:13.810 --> 13:15.477
but still,
razzle dazzle, right?

13:15.545 --> 13:17.278
- Abed.
- Hmm?

13:17.346 --> 13:20.247
- Jeff made out with Annie.
- What? When?

13:20.315 --> 13:21.615
- Where?
- Yeah, where?

13:21.683 --> 13:23.450
That's inappropriate.
I'm assuming in the mouth.

13:23.518 --> 13:25.051
It was after
the transfer dance.

13:25.119 --> 13:27.120
Oh! So I tell you
that I love you,

13:27.187 --> 13:28.721
and then you go outside

13:28.788 --> 13:30.622
and stick your tongue
into a teenager.

13:30.690 --> 13:32.657
What is wrong with you,
Jeffrey?

13:32.725 --> 13:33.792
Well, Shirley,

13:33.859 --> 13:35.727
since you have clearly
failed to grasp

13:35.794 --> 13:37.962
the central insipid metaphor

13:38.029 --> 13:39.796
<i>of those twilight books
you devour,</i>

13:39.864 --> 13:41.297
let me explain it to you.

13:41.365 --> 13:42.999
Men are monsters
who crave young flesh.

13:43.066 --> 13:44.299
The end!

13:44.367 --> 13:46.401
At least we have the decency
to be ashamed of it

13:46.469 --> 13:47.802
and keep it a secret

13:47.870 --> 13:49.571
instead of publicly blurting,
"I love you,"

13:49.638 --> 13:50.972
to everyone who sleeps with us!

13:51.040 --> 13:52.640
Oh, please!
I never loved you.

13:52.707 --> 13:54.575
Aha!

13:54.642 --> 13:57.277
I win!
I win!

13:57.345 --> 13:58.612
I win!
In your face!

13:58.680 --> 14:00.347
So this was all a game?

14:00.415 --> 14:02.615
Everything they do
is some sick competition.

14:02.683 --> 14:04.183
Oh, like you hate competition.

14:04.251 --> 14:05.618
How long did it take you
to kiss Jeff

14:05.685 --> 14:06.919
after I told him
that I loved him?

14:06.987 --> 14:08.654
Oh, that's right!

14:08.721 --> 14:10.254
First Vaughn, now Jeff.

14:10.322 --> 14:11.789
I better not smile
at that wall outlet,

14:11.856 --> 14:13.457
or you'll fry your tongue off!

14:13.525 --> 14:15.258
Way to hog all the girls, Jeff.

14:15.326 --> 14:17.661
You know, when there's
three sprinkle donuts,

14:17.728 --> 14:19.796
you don't eat one
and then lick another!

14:19.864 --> 14:22.131
Anyone object to us being
referred to as donuts? No one?

14:22.198 --> 14:24.666
I'm sorry we can't all be
as honorable as you, Troy,

14:24.733 --> 14:27.302
and post Pierce quotes
all day on Twitter.

14:27.370 --> 14:29.338
Wow. Is that
your lame attempt

14:29.405 --> 14:31.306
to try and pass
the hot seat to me?

14:31.374 --> 14:32.507
Nice try!

14:32.575 --> 14:34.275
Wait!
I'm "oldwhitemansays"?

14:34.343 --> 14:36.311
No wonder he says everything
I'm thinking.

14:36.379 --> 14:38.380
You bastard.

14:38.447 --> 14:41.349
I'm just sharing what you say.

14:41.417 --> 14:44.117
Yeah? Well, what if I shared
all the stuff you say?

14:44.184 --> 14:46.953
He thinks all dogs are boys
and all cats are girls.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.520
There's no way
to disprove that.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.389
Have you ever seen a cat penis?

14:50.456 --> 14:52.557
Where you going?

14:52.625 --> 14:54.626
By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you...

14:54.693 --> 14:56.027
Cancelled.

14:56.095 --> 14:58.162
Oh, good, yeah, Abed.
Cancel us.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.131
And while you're at it,
why don't you take your cutesy,

15:00.198 --> 15:02.833
"I can't tell life from TV"
gimmick with you?

15:02.901 --> 15:05.034
You know,
it's very "season one."

15:09.272 --> 15:11.906
I can tell life from TV, Jeff.

15:11.974 --> 15:14.642
TV makes sense and has
structure, logic, rules.

15:14.710 --> 15:16.710
And likeable leading men.

15:16.778 --> 15:18.945
In life, we have this.

15:19.013 --> 15:20.981
We have you.

15:28.654 --> 15:30.154
I'm on the clock
for another hour

15:30.222 --> 15:33.090
if you want me to do
some Batman lines.

15:50.516 --> 15:52.950
Not sitting
with your little group?

15:53.017 --> 15:55.184
- The little group is done.
- Yeah, well...

15:55.252 --> 15:58.187
Mission-ary
accomplished, right?

15:58.255 --> 16:00.122
- What does that mean?
- Come on.

16:00.190 --> 16:02.324
I know you and Britta did it.

16:02.392 --> 16:03.558
Isn't the whole reason

16:03.626 --> 16:05.093
you got together
with those people

16:05.160 --> 16:07.294
because you wanted
to bang the blond?

16:07.362 --> 16:10.164
And now I hear that you
frenched the brunette.

16:10.231 --> 16:13.566
What more could you have
gotten out of that group?

16:13.634 --> 16:15.701
Good morning, class.

16:15.769 --> 16:19.637
Let's dive in and hear
the results of your assignment.

16:19.705 --> 16:21.104
Who wants to go first?

16:21.172 --> 16:22.839
I don't know, Mr. Winger.

16:22.907 --> 16:24.874
The last time I called on you,

16:24.942 --> 16:28.710
I kinda got what the maku-maku
call dirt roaded.

16:28.778 --> 16:30.612
Using it!

16:30.680 --> 16:32.881
- Yeah, I-I'm sorry
about that.

16:34.950 --> 16:36.284
It was a trick question.

16:36.351 --> 16:39.321
The tool most important
to humanity's survival

16:39.388 --> 16:42.489
wasn't any of the nine
in the box.

16:42.557 --> 16:44.058
Go on.

16:44.126 --> 16:47.928
The most important tool
is respect.

16:47.996 --> 16:48.929
Ha!

16:48.997 --> 16:50.697
Gaaaa-yyyy!

16:50.765 --> 16:53.599
And the reason I know
respect is a tool

16:53.667 --> 16:57.369
is because it is clearly
not a natural thing,

16:57.437 --> 16:59.605
and we forget to use it
all the time,

16:59.672 --> 17:02.373
and then we start
competing with each other

17:02.441 --> 17:04.308
and exploiting each other

17:04.376 --> 17:07.010
and humiliating each other
and controlling each other.

17:07.077 --> 17:09.612
And we lose each other.

17:09.679 --> 17:13.181
And without each other,
we'll go extinct.

17:13.249 --> 17:15.317
And that's a fact.

17:15.385 --> 17:17.053
Ha.
Gay fact.

17:17.121 --> 17:18.820
That's my answer, Professor.

17:18.888 --> 17:20.321
Hmm.

17:23.058 --> 17:24.892
Well, that's one answer.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.760
Here's the one I had in mind.

17:26.828 --> 17:30.695
Combining all nine tools,

17:30.763 --> 17:33.331
you get this...

17:33.398 --> 17:37.901
a deadlier weapon than
any one item in the box.

17:37.969 --> 17:41.905
So I'm gonna use this
to attack you

17:41.973 --> 17:44.240
and you use respect
to defend yourself.

17:44.308 --> 17:45.741
- Uh--o--uh--

17:46.943 --> 17:48.644
- oh!

17:48.712 --> 17:49.878
Ugh!

17:49.946 --> 17:51.780
Oh, my God!

17:51.848 --> 17:55.116
I...Respect you!

17:55.184 --> 17:57.551
That's why you fail!

18:02.283 --> 18:04.917
- He's passing out!
- Oh, my God!

18:04.985 --> 18:07.285
- Oh!
- Stay with us, buddy!

18:09.388 --> 18:11.389
- Oh, thank God.
- Hello! Hello, Jeffrey.

18:11.457 --> 18:13.490
- What happened?
- Professor Bauer got suspended,

18:13.558 --> 18:15.725
and we got an automatic "a"
on our assignment.

18:15.793 --> 18:18.394
Did someone throw urine
in my face?

18:18.461 --> 18:20.829
Oh. Sometimes I surprise
myself under pressure.

18:20.897 --> 18:22.597
Jeff, about the assignment.
We decided...

18:22.665 --> 18:24.565
You had the right answer.

18:24.633 --> 18:26.033
I think we need
a little more respect

18:26.100 --> 18:27.634
and a little less passion.

18:27.701 --> 18:28.768
Which will be easy for me

18:28.836 --> 18:30.836
because I think
you're kinda gross now.

18:30.904 --> 18:32.171
Awesome.

18:32.238 --> 18:33.972
Pierce, I'm gonna delete
that Twitter account.

18:34.040 --> 18:35.507
Your friendship
is more important

18:35.574 --> 18:37.075
than 600,000 strangers.

18:37.142 --> 18:38.543
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:38.610 --> 18:41.412
Are you saying 600,000 people
read what I say on Twitter?

18:41.479 --> 18:43.413
We gotta cash in on that!

18:43.481 --> 18:47.150
How 'bout oldwhitemansays...
The TV show?

18:47.217 --> 18:48.351
No.

18:48.418 --> 18:49.919
Who would watch that?

18:49.986 --> 18:51.286
Speaking of bad
development strategy,

18:51.354 --> 18:52.788
I owe you all an apology.

18:52.855 --> 18:55.022
I was trying so hard to make
our first week a great one,

18:55.090 --> 18:56.757
I didn't realize there was
something great in front of us

18:56.825 --> 18:58.792
the whole time... an old woman
drinking her own pee.

18:58.860 --> 19:00.894
- You're right.
- It's true.

19:00.962 --> 19:02.396
Guys.

19:02.463 --> 19:04.364
I got a confession to make...
I took anthropology

19:04.432 --> 19:06.398
because I want to be
a part of your study group.

19:06.466 --> 19:08.567
- Oh.
- Oh!

19:08.635 --> 19:11.769
I gotta do the honest thing
and just ask.

19:11.837 --> 19:13.804
Is there any room
in this pocket

19:13.872 --> 19:16.272
for a little spare Chang?

19:16.340 --> 19:20.243
- Uh...W-we've been through
a lot today.

19:20.311 --> 19:22.846
Give us a little time
to think it over.

19:22.913 --> 19:24.547
Totally, totally, man.

19:24.615 --> 19:26.482
Just think about it,
take your time,

19:26.550 --> 19:28.183
and, uh...Let me know.

19:28.251 --> 19:29.918
- Bye.
- See ya.

19:29.986 --> 19:30.919
All right.

19:30.987 --> 19:33.055
Oh! Poor guy.

19:33.122 --> 19:34.256
Oh, we'll let him in
eventually.

19:34.323 --> 19:35.824
Says who?

19:35.891 --> 19:37.792
Look, we have the strength
to survive anything.

19:37.860 --> 19:39.927
What's the worst that can
happen with Chang?

19:39.995 --> 19:41.395
