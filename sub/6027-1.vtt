00:07.216 --> 00:09.808
The Government is coming
under increasing pressure

00:09.843 --> 00:13.038
to take urgent action
to reduce the soaring cost of food.

00:13.073 --> 00:14.634
The latest Food Price Index

00:14.669 --> 00:18.023
indicates that many food commodities
on international markets

00:18.058 --> 00:20.576
have doubled in value
in the last six months,

00:20.610 --> 00:23.527
reflected by rocketing prices.

00:23.562 --> 00:27.315
A group of backbench MPs
have called for an emergency...

00:27.350 --> 00:28.515
We're closed.

00:33.713 --> 00:34.953
We're closed!

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:43.471 --> 00:46.190
What? No, look, we're closed,
what are you doing?

00:46.225 --> 00:47.270
Come here a minute.

00:48.789 --> 00:49.789
You had this.

00:51.949 --> 00:52.660
Where is it?

00:52.663 --> 00:55.108
What's the matter with you?
I just said we're close...

00:57.307 --> 00:59.547
Oh, no. Oh, no...

01:13.583 --> 01:16.582
I sold it, I have.

01:16.617 --> 01:17.582
Oh, no.

01:19.741 --> 01:21.181
Oh, no.

01:22.541 --> 01:23.980
Who?

01:25.740 --> 01:27.859
Er...

01:27.894 --> 01:30.099
That's...
That's all I've got, honest.

01:38.817 --> 01:40.296
Can I go?

01:40.331 --> 01:42.416
Can I just go, please?

01:42.451 --> 01:43.735
Not yet.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.535
It's OK.

01:45.570 --> 01:48.414
This'll just make you sleep is all.

01:48.449 --> 01:50.374
What?

01:50.409 --> 01:51.573
Really?

02:02.131 --> 02:04.330
Where is Jessica Hyde?

02:04.365 --> 02:05.490
Who... Who's she?

02:07.729 --> 02:09.729
Where is Jessica Hyde?

02:09.764 --> 02:11.488
Is... Is she a customer?

02:11.523 --> 02:14.367
Because if she's a customer, I can
find her, I can find her on the...

02:16.607 --> 02:18.486
Where is Jessica Hyde?

02:18.521 --> 02:20.606
I'm thinking so hard.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.045
I really am, I just...

02:23.080 --> 02:24.365
I don't know that name.

02:32.323 --> 02:33.602
No, I...

02:33.637 --> 02:35.242
It's just gas.

02:35.277 --> 02:36.882
You've got to sleep.

03:09.353 --> 03:10.633
I'm gasping.

03:14.992 --> 03:16.271
I'll light it outside.

03:51.582 --> 03:53.542
Don't put the gas away yet.

04:15.016 --> 04:17.975
I mean, the thing is... it's a comic.

04:18.010 --> 04:19.894
No, it's a graphic novel.

04:20.935 --> 04:23.014
It's called The Utopia Experiments.

04:24.334 --> 04:28.653
It's about a scientist who makes
a deal with the devil for knowledge.

04:28.688 --> 04:31.332
And the devil appears
in a number of guises,

04:31.367 --> 04:34.571
but always as an animal-human hybrid,

04:34.606 --> 04:36.731
most notably a rabbit...

04:36.766 --> 04:37.890
A rabbit?

04:37.925 --> 04:38.650
Yeah.

04:38.685 --> 04:42.849
Oh, so he's in it, then? The guy
that wrote this, it's about him?

04:42.884 --> 04:45.728
Hardly original, I mean Bukowski.

04:45.763 --> 04:46.768
Hmm.

04:49.087 --> 04:51.287
His name was Mark Dane.

04:51.322 --> 04:54.446
He was a delusional
paranoid schizophrenic.

04:54.481 --> 04:57.525
He spent two years in
a mental institution called Shenley,

04:57.560 --> 05:00.045
where he wrote this
and then killed himself,

05:00.080 --> 05:02.764
which... adds to the conspiracy.

05:02.799 --> 05:06.963
It can be linked to BSE,
the assassination of Indira Gan...

05:06.998 --> 05:09.562
Conspiracy's not really very now.

05:09.597 --> 05:11.602
Are you saying
that you think this is real?

05:11.637 --> 05:13.281
Because that's a bit...

05:13.316 --> 05:15.481
Can I actually say
what I want to say?!

05:15.516 --> 05:19.520
No-one's attacking you, Becky.
You studied medicine.

05:19.555 --> 05:21.719
Up until May,
you were on course to be a doctor,

05:21.754 --> 05:24.198
so... why the sudden change?

05:24.233 --> 05:25.198
My father died.

05:27.118 --> 05:30.437
My father had a degenerative illness
called Deel's syndrome,

05:30.472 --> 05:33.156
where his entire body shut down.

05:33.191 --> 05:35.395
His fingers, arms, legs, hands,

05:35.430 --> 05:37.155
until all that was left
was his throat,

05:37.190 --> 05:39.594
and when that stopped working,
he suffocated to death.

05:39.629 --> 05:41.154
Becky, no-one is attacking you...

05:41.189 --> 05:43.713
Look, are you going to fucking
fund this or what?!

05:43.748 --> 05:46.113
I mean, look at you!
I've had a look at your website.

05:46.148 --> 05:49.392
You've got people doing PhDs in...
Star Wars and Doctor fucking Who!

06:26.422 --> 06:28.142
Martin needs the RDS sheets.

06:28.177 --> 06:29.461
I'm doing that, I'm just...

06:29.496 --> 06:30.861
No, you're not,
you're messing about on forums.

06:30.896 --> 06:33.340
I'm not messing around on forums.

06:36.100 --> 06:38.739
He needs these before Frankfurt.
Why aren't you doing them?

06:38.774 --> 06:41.138
Because it's so tedious
it's making my eyes bleed.

06:41.173 --> 06:43.418
You think you're so much better
than everyone else.

06:43.453 --> 06:46.257
No. I think we're all morons.

06:46.292 --> 06:48.297
Just... fucking do it, Ian!

06:50.056 --> 06:54.815
I mean...
if you've got any questions, ask.

06:54.850 --> 06:57.094
Actually, I...
I do have one question.

06:57.129 --> 06:58.974
Martin's penis.

06:59.009 --> 07:01.573
Is that a meaty taste,
or is it more salty?

07:01.608 --> 07:03.333
Very witty, Ian, so smart.

07:03.368 --> 07:05.932
Or do you just not think of that
and get on with the job in hand?

07:05.967 --> 07:07.532
Yeah, well, I've got a joke for you.

07:07.567 --> 07:10.531
You're 28 years old and you still
live at home with your mum.

07:10.566 --> 07:13.850
Ha! That's a laugh!

08:06.077 --> 08:07.156
Wilson Wilson...

08:10.475 --> 08:12.875
Jesus Christ, Grant.

08:12.910 --> 08:15.194
780 members, and it has to be Grant.

08:28.911 --> 08:31.670
Becky, Becky, Becky... Hello, Becky.

09:24.616 --> 09:26.456
Jesus Christ...

11:28.488 --> 11:30.488
Hi, hon!

11:30.523 --> 11:31.967
Michael? Where are you?

11:33.767 --> 11:34.807
Are you OK?

11:36.166 --> 11:39.126
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine,
I'm, eh...

11:41.525 --> 11:43.164
...at work!

11:43.199 --> 11:44.564
I'll be a little late.

11:44.599 --> 11:46.484
You sound a little bit
out of kilter.

11:46.519 --> 11:48.523
No, I'm fine, Jen.

11:48.558 --> 11:51.602
D-Department of Health politics is all.

11:51.637 --> 11:53.042
I love you.

11:54.482 --> 11:56.121
Yeah, course you do.

11:56.156 --> 11:58.521
Idiot.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.879
And are you... OK about tomorrow?

12:02.914 --> 12:05.319
About the clinic?

12:05.354 --> 12:07.718
What? Yeah, of course.

12:07.753 --> 12:09.798
I have a good feeling this time.

12:09.833 --> 12:10.597
Heh...

12:10.632 --> 12:12.677
Look, I'd better go.

12:20.075 --> 12:22.234
You get my whore pregnant.

12:22.269 --> 12:25.474
You want your wife to know?
You want your minister to know?

12:25.509 --> 12:30.312
Look, look... I-I'm not anyone,
I'm just a civil servant.

12:30.347 --> 12:34.751
Senior civil servant. You're
private secretary to the minister.

12:34.786 --> 12:36.231
Important.

12:36.266 --> 12:40.350
No. No, no, no, no, no, no,
you're wrong, I'm no-one.

12:40.385 --> 12:43.069
Shut your fucking shit mouth!

12:43.104 --> 12:47.068
You think I care about you
or your bitch wife?

12:47.103 --> 12:49.627
You do a mission for me, yeah?

12:50.787 --> 12:52.347
Mission? What are you...?

12:52.382 --> 12:56.506
You get my whore pregnant,
you think this is game?

12:56.541 --> 12:59.585
We play game, spy game.

12:59.620 --> 13:01.024
I have friends.

13:01.059 --> 13:03.504
Do mission for my friends, yeah?

13:03.539 --> 13:05.583
You do what we say

13:05.618 --> 13:07.223
or I fuck your life.

13:35.775 --> 13:39.774
And then there's the secondary-care
waiting times for cancer patients.

13:39.809 --> 13:40.774
We'll have to set those on the...

13:40.809 --> 13:42.854
No, no, that's medical.

13:42.889 --> 13:45.413
Let Deidra set those in consultation
with the GMC.

13:45.448 --> 13:49.012
Sure? Cancer makes the papers.
Geoff won't be happy.

13:49.047 --> 13:51.371
Oh, bollocks to Geoff.

13:51.406 --> 13:54.131
And, of course, there's this meeting
with Corvadt tomorrow.

13:54.140 --> 13:54.710
Oh, Christ.

13:54.726 --> 13:56.690
Conran Letts himself, no less.

13:56.725 --> 13:59.489
He'll just to try and flog me
that bloody Russian flu vaccine.

13:59.524 --> 14:02.688
I'll have to take Michael with me or
I won't understand a fucking word.

14:05.768 --> 14:06.807
Michael.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.407
A penny for your thoughts.

14:14.880 --> 14:17.285
Shit, vaccines! That reminds me,

14:17.320 --> 14:21.204
we've got to get the updated rubella
before GPs start griping.

14:21.239 --> 14:23.643
I'll get you that to you today,
Michael.

14:29.322 --> 14:30.321
That's me, Joe.

14:32.201 --> 14:34.960
Funeral, is it?

14:34.995 --> 14:36.800
You're not wearing black.

14:47.837 --> 14:50.076
You get serious about this job, Ian!

14:52.316 --> 14:54.995
Not everything's beneath you!

15:01.313 --> 15:05.032
And then we extract sequenced
polymorphic loci from the patient,

15:05.067 --> 15:08.831
put it through an amplified
testing process using PCR.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.831
Very exciting.

15:10.866 --> 15:13.590
Well, yes, that is very...

15:13.625 --> 15:16.189
But we still have
over 20 million shots of Tamiflu

15:16.224 --> 15:18.189
for the swine flu that never hit.

15:18.224 --> 15:20.308
Russian flu's been around forever.

15:20.343 --> 15:21.828
Michael.

15:21.863 --> 15:23.188
According to our research,

15:23.223 --> 15:26.467
the H1N1 pathogen in this new strain
is about to mutate

15:26.502 --> 15:27.906
and will have the potential

15:27.941 --> 15:30.066
for mortality rates
in the hundreds of thousands.

15:30.101 --> 15:31.426
We've made a thorough report.

15:31.461 --> 15:33.505
And we don't agree with it.

15:33.540 --> 15:37.344
Neither does the WHO
or the Geneva Medical Institute.

15:37.379 --> 15:39.304
Look, food prices are rocketing,

15:39.339 --> 15:41.663
there are riots
on the streets of Sydney.

15:41.698 --> 15:43.549
No-one's thinking about flu.

15:44.537 --> 15:46.942
Bloody Geoff. So sorry, Sir Conran.

15:57.353 --> 15:59.313
You should persuade him to take it.

16:03.516 --> 16:05.396
You should make it your mission.

16:09.557 --> 16:11.277
M-My mission?

16:11.312 --> 16:12.678
It's your mission.

16:15.359 --> 16:18.321
This word mean something to you,
Dugdale?

16:20.801 --> 16:23.683
All of us have a mission in life.

16:23.718 --> 16:26.563
This is yours.

16:26.598 --> 16:27.603
Understand?

16:32.765 --> 16:35.766
Do you fucking understand
your mission?

16:40.008 --> 16:42.008
Sorry.

16:42.043 --> 16:43.409
Did I miss anything?

16:50.812 --> 16:54.933
Oi! What do you think you're doing?!
That's my car!

16:56.214 --> 16:57.333
Come on, then.

16:59.055 --> 17:01.295
Come on, then!

17:01.330 --> 17:03.136
What?

17:03.171 --> 17:04.337
Are you joking?

17:05.817 --> 17:07.017
What are you...?

17:07.051 --> 17:09.538
What are you talking about,
you little shit?

17:14.220 --> 17:15.700
Sorry, mate.

17:18.461 --> 17:20.821
What's the matter with you?

17:20.857 --> 17:23.063
I'm twice your size,
for Christ's sake.

17:25.463 --> 17:26.704
Sorry.

17:28.585 --> 17:31.226
Mate...

17:31.261 --> 17:33.426
I'm just...
I'm just a piece of shit.

17:38.948 --> 17:39.788
Well, don't start...

17:39.823 --> 17:40.949
I'm sorry.

17:40.984 --> 17:43.990
You're not a piece of...
You just shouldn't be doing this.

17:44.025 --> 17:45.270
That's my car.

17:52.592 --> 17:54.794
Shake, yeah?

17:54.829 --> 17:56.114
Who's shit now, mate?

17:57.674 --> 17:59.436
Oh, you fucking animal!

17:59.471 --> 18:02.916
You're the shit now, innit, mate?!

18:44.531 --> 18:48.532
I meant to ask you
about the PSF on clinical data.

18:48.567 --> 18:49.893
I'm in a hurry, can Tony...?

18:49.928 --> 18:52.774
Sure. I've got an appointment later,
but I'll...

18:52.809 --> 18:55.015
Now... what about the vaccine?

18:56.575 --> 18:58.215
Should we order the vaccine?

18:58.250 --> 19:01.537
The new rubella? Yes, definitely.
Do it today, I'm not here tomorrow,

19:01.572 --> 19:03.697
and there's a price increase
factored in if...

19:03.732 --> 19:05.659
No. Russian flu.

19:07.219 --> 19:12.301
I've looked at the projections again,
and... I think we could reconsider.

19:12.336 --> 19:15.462
What are you talking about?
Russian flu?!

19:15.497 --> 19:18.582
I might as well
put a fucking gun to my head!

19:18.617 --> 19:20.664
Christ, what's the matter with you?

19:52.635 --> 19:54.115
Hello.

19:54.150 --> 19:55.996
Becky...

19:56.031 --> 19:57.996
Wilson Wilson?

19:58.032 --> 19:59.517
Are you Wilson Wilson?

20:00.758 --> 20:02.878
Well, why aren't you wearing blue?

20:02.913 --> 20:04.118
Don't look good in blue.

20:08.848 --> 20:10.088
What?

21:26.820 --> 21:28.340
Got it!

21:33.621 --> 21:35.582
Does anyone else know you had that?

21:35.617 --> 21:37.661
Just some friends.

21:37.696 --> 21:42.423
Not friends, just on... on a forum,
friends on a forum.

21:42.458 --> 21:45.463
It's there, on my computer,
I can get it for you.

22:00.065 --> 22:03.505
No Bejan, no Grant.

22:03.540 --> 22:06.225
Do you think we got the right place?

22:06.260 --> 22:09.307
Funny, seeing each other like this.

22:11.306 --> 22:13.187
I didn't expect you to be pretty,
Becky.

22:15.027 --> 22:18.187
Thank you, Wilson... I think.

22:18.222 --> 22:20.508
And you, Ian,
I didn't expect you to be...

22:21.668 --> 22:22.509
Tall?

22:22.544 --> 22:23.989
No, black.

22:27.469 --> 22:28.869
What do you do, Becky?

22:28.904 --> 22:31.470
I'm applying for a PhD.

22:31.505 --> 22:33.870
Believe me,
it's not important or interesting.

22:33.905 --> 22:35.390
Worried I'm too thick to get it?

22:35.425 --> 22:37.030
Yes, I am.

22:39.231 --> 22:40.391
What do you do?

22:40.426 --> 22:43.072
Well, think of the least interesting
thing you can think of.

22:43.107 --> 22:44.152
IT.

22:45.752 --> 22:47.032
Oh, no fucking way!

22:47.067 --> 22:49.232
Way fucking way.

22:51.068 --> 22:52.793
I also live with my mum.

22:52.828 --> 22:55.553
Jesus Christ,
you're gonna make me cry now, Ian!

22:56.754 --> 22:58.394
What happened?

22:58.429 --> 23:00.394
I don't know.

23:00.429 --> 23:01.795
I really don't know.

23:10.675 --> 23:12.275
Where is Jessica Hyde?

23:15.117 --> 23:16.356
Who's that?

23:21.197 --> 23:23.117
I don't...

23:23.153 --> 23:25.518
Where is Jessica Hyde?

23:25.553 --> 23:26.998
Look...

23:30.678 --> 23:32.398
I don't know who that is!

23:32.433 --> 23:34.199
Look, just...

23:34.234 --> 23:36.479
Look, do you want money?
I've got money.

23:37.599 --> 23:38.880
I can give you money.

23:49.321 --> 23:52.202
Where... is...

23:54.243 --> 23:55.282
Jessica

23:57.682 --> 23:58.763
Hyde?

24:02.043 --> 24:06.163
I honestly... have no idea

24:06.198 --> 24:07.725
who you're talking about.

24:26.247 --> 24:27.287
Ah!

25:01.892 --> 25:03.373
Ah!

25:37.178 --> 25:38.338
Where is it?

26:33.181 --> 26:36.343
Just about to raise
the contracts for the vaccine.

26:36.378 --> 26:40.423
Just need you to sign off and then
it's all systems go.

26:40.458 --> 26:41.703
The rubella?

26:41.738 --> 26:42.824
Yeah. Great.

26:49.344 --> 26:51.784
Did it go OK today?

26:51.819 --> 26:54.265
Oh, Geoff wants my job.

26:54.300 --> 26:56.065
It was OK.

26:57.706 --> 26:59.906
Are you all right, Michael?

26:59.941 --> 27:02.466
Everything at home all right?

27:02.501 --> 27:04.106
You just seem a bit, erm...

27:10.547 --> 27:12.708
We're doing IVF.

27:14.748 --> 27:17.108
Jen can't conceive.

27:18.269 --> 27:19.709
I don't know what to do.

27:23.470 --> 27:26.150
I can't talk about this just now,
Greg.

27:26.185 --> 27:28.990
Greg, I think if I speak I might...

27:29.025 --> 27:29.991
crack.

27:32.230 --> 27:34.991
OK. OK. I understand.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.673
If you need to take some time?

27:39.708 --> 27:41.513
I don't. Thank you.

27:41.548 --> 27:43.074
But... I don't.

27:48.516 --> 27:51.437
You're actually saying that
the tsunami that killed, what,

27:51.472 --> 27:55.879
hundreds of thousands was the
American military testing a weapon?

27:55.914 --> 27:58.440
You're fucking mental, Wilson.

27:58.475 --> 28:00.160
It's called a tsunami bomb.

28:00.195 --> 28:02.601
A strategically placed
nuke on the seabed.

28:02.636 --> 28:05.002
Technology has existed
since World War II.

28:05.037 --> 28:06.762
You're fucking mental, Wilson!

28:06.797 --> 28:10.324
Think about it. We're living on a
planet with dwindling resources.

28:10.359 --> 28:11.644
Do you watch the news, Ian?

28:11.679 --> 28:15.606
Jesus Christ! Wilson, if just one of
the conspiracy theories was proved...

28:15.641 --> 28:16.885
What about Utopia then?

28:16.921 --> 28:20.087
Oh, don't start all of that
Nostradamus crap. Tell him, Becky.

28:20.122 --> 28:24.528
I don't believe it, as such.

28:24.563 --> 28:27.890
But there are some things in it
that are a bit odd.

28:27.925 --> 28:28.890
What?

28:30.330 --> 28:33.452
Oh, Becky, Becky, Becky!

28:33.487 --> 28:36.373
How can you believe any of that?
You!

28:36.408 --> 28:38.373
Why are you into it then?

28:38.408 --> 28:41.175
Well... for the artwork.

28:41.210 --> 28:45.015
The stories, the sheer imaginative
vision.

28:45.050 --> 28:48.097
It's like opening
a door into another world.

28:48.132 --> 28:50.818
I don't need to diminish it by
pretending it's real.

28:50.853 --> 28:52.458
It's opening a door all right,

28:52.493 --> 28:57.019
but what you don't realise is that
it is opening the door to reality.

29:02.021 --> 29:03.902
What does that even mean, Wilson?

29:06.303 --> 29:08.304
I don't know. I'm a bit drunk.

29:12.580 --> 29:14.505
Oh! Last orders.

29:15.746 --> 29:17.667
No sign of Bejan or Grant.

29:17.702 --> 29:21.709
Let's go back to mine and drink
until we can't feel our legs.

29:26.550 --> 29:28.471
Who's the little bitch then, son?

29:28.506 --> 29:30.311
Does she know you're a bag of puke?

29:30.346 --> 29:31.392
Sure does, Dad.

29:31.427 --> 29:34.472
After all, I came out of your
withered testicles.

29:37.508 --> 29:38.954
Your dad's madder than you!

29:38.989 --> 29:40.755
Well, he called me Wilson,
didn't he?

29:41.755 --> 29:43.756
So Wilson Wilson's your real name?

29:47.317 --> 29:49.318
What did you use all this stuff for?

29:49.353 --> 29:53.279
Expunging all trace of myself
from the World Wide Web.

29:53.314 --> 29:55.319
I have, over the past five years,

29:55.355 --> 29:58.681
using various international laws,
data protection acts

29:58.716 --> 30:02.522
and internet know-how, wiped all
trace of me from the world.

30:03.843 --> 30:08.044
No bank account, no bills,
driver's licence, nothing.

30:08.079 --> 30:11.966
Every IP address here is masked
and encrypted to avoid detection.

30:14.926 --> 30:15.927
I'm invisible.

30:16.968 --> 30:20.568
You do know you've used your
real name on our forum, right?

30:22.129 --> 30:24.050
Who'd believe that's a real name?

30:25.850 --> 30:27.691
I can lower my heart rate,
pick locks

30:27.726 --> 30:30.492
and, if I was handcuffed
to a radiator, I could escape

30:30.527 --> 30:32.293
by dislocating both my thumbs.

30:35.413 --> 30:36.494
Why?

30:36.529 --> 30:38.414
Look out your window, Ian.

30:38.449 --> 30:41.336
When the shit hits,
Wilson Wilson will not...

30:41.371 --> 30:43.056
Oh! Slivovitz!

30:43.091 --> 30:44.137
Brilliant!

30:44.172 --> 30:45.337
It's Polish.

30:45.372 --> 30:49.258
It will make us go blind.

30:51.859 --> 30:54.420
Do you want to see my nuclear
fallout shelter?

31:02.303 --> 31:03.303
Wilson!

31:05.423 --> 31:06.905
Wilson.

31:09.225 --> 31:11.866
Wilson Wilson!

31:14.667 --> 31:15.787
Gone. He's gone!

31:17.148 --> 31:18.148
Well, erm...

31:19.229 --> 31:23.350
I guess that means we're
alone, Ian.

31:24.791 --> 31:26.911
Stay.

31:26.946 --> 31:28.712
Ow!

31:28.747 --> 31:31.032
Shit. Sorry.

31:31.068 --> 31:32.793
I'm so drunk.

31:35.195 --> 31:36.915
Ah! Ow!

31:36.950 --> 31:38.355
Ah!

31:53.520 --> 31:54.961
Ah! Fuck!

31:54.996 --> 31:56.962
Sorry. Sorry.

31:56.997 --> 31:58.001
Ah!

31:58.037 --> 31:59.443
Are you OK?

32:12.682 --> 32:13.727
OK.

32:22.571 --> 32:25.372
Wait. Wait.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.738
What? WHAT?

32:47.179 --> 32:48.419
What?

32:48.454 --> 32:50.220
Um...

32:50.255 --> 32:52.541
My penis isn't working.

32:56.102 --> 32:58.662
It's a disaster.

33:00.339 --> 33:01.544
Ssh!

33:40.838 --> 33:43.479
Are you a friend of Bejan Chervo's?

33:43.514 --> 33:45.960
We found Bejan dead this morning.

33:45.995 --> 33:47.240
Can't be 100%,

33:47.275 --> 33:50.201
but it looks like he's
jumped from his balcony window.

33:52.041 --> 33:53.402
Like... suicide?

33:53.437 --> 33:55.523
Are you OK?
Would you like some tea?

33:55.558 --> 33:59.323
I don't drink tea.
Caffeine was invented by the CIA.

34:00.725 --> 34:02.525
Did he leave a note?

34:02.560 --> 34:03.566
No note.

34:03.601 --> 34:05.566
But...he's dead?

34:05.601 --> 34:07.206
Would you like some water?

34:08.286 --> 34:09.286
No.

34:12.969 --> 34:14.649
Can I have some water, please?

34:25.053 --> 34:27.132
What makes you think it was suicide?

34:27.168 --> 34:30.574
He had a history of depression
stretching back years. So...

34:30.610 --> 34:32.295
What?! No, he didn't.

34:32.330 --> 34:33.936
He did.

34:33.971 --> 34:35.616
Look, sometimes people...

34:35.650 --> 34:39.417
Listen to me. I knew Bejan, all
right?

34:39.452 --> 34:41.579
He was not depressed.

34:41.614 --> 34:43.139
Medical records don't lie.

35:11.629 --> 35:12.709
Gotcha!

35:12.744 --> 35:14.749
I've got you this time, eh?

35:14.784 --> 35:16.190
Who's the shit now, eh?

35:16.225 --> 35:17.350
Who's the shit now?

35:17.385 --> 35:18.471
Get off me!

35:18.506 --> 35:21.032
You're not going anywhere, mate.
Ahhh!

35:21.067 --> 35:22.192
Fuck!

35:22.227 --> 35:24.113
You little shit!

35:24.148 --> 35:26.274
You little fucker!

35:29.835 --> 35:32.195
Michael, this is for Russian Flu.

35:32.230 --> 35:33.676
What, are we getting that?

35:35.757 --> 35:37.958
It's all signed off, isn't it?

35:37.993 --> 35:39.838
Yeah, but I mean...

35:39.873 --> 35:41.599
Do you want to check?

35:41.634 --> 35:43.640
I mean, once we're contractually
obliged...

35:43.675 --> 35:45.600
Just put the fucking thing in, Bev!

35:56.639 --> 35:58.565
I hope you've been paying
attention.

35:58.600 --> 36:00.445
There'll be a test at the end.

36:00.480 --> 36:02.886
Pens at the ready,
brains switched on.

36:05.083 --> 36:06.838
Can I help you?

36:10.307 --> 36:13.418
That's Grant Leetham, Miss.
He's in our class.

36:15.252 --> 36:17.964
The police are here, Grant.

36:17.999 --> 36:21.034
A man was very seriously
hurt today.

36:21.069 --> 36:23.228
Do you know anything about this?

36:27.255 --> 36:29.847
Look, Grant, I want to help you.

36:29.882 --> 36:31.881
If you're mixed up in something...

36:43.445 --> 36:46.117
Well, if you won't talk to me...

36:46.152 --> 36:48.231
Come in, gentlemen.

36:53.694 --> 36:56.166
It's all right, Grant.
It's policemen.

36:56.202 --> 36:58.120
They're not going to bite.

36:58.155 --> 37:00.673
Too high this time; we checked.

37:05.178 --> 37:07.492
Listen, I know this is serious,

37:07.526 --> 37:12.995
but if he's sorry, perhaps we could
talk to the gentleman involved?

37:13.029 --> 37:17.022
He is only 11 and there are
circumstances at home.

37:26.154 --> 37:27.909
Jesus Christ!

37:38.436 --> 37:40.310
All right, Rejane? Tel?

37:43.022 --> 37:44.019
Ian Johnson?

37:45.677 --> 37:48.432
I'm Detective Inspector Leeman,
this is DC Keatly.

37:49.278 --> 37:52.300
I'm arresting you under the
Sexual Offences Act 2003

37:52.330 --> 37:54.910
on suspicion of rape of a child
under the age of 13,

37:54.945 --> 37:57.723
assault of a child under the age
of 13 by penetration

37:57.758 --> 38:00.892
and inflicting grievous
bodily harm with intent.

38:09.800 --> 38:13.494
A guilty plea, first offence,
not on the register, maybe

38:13.500 --> 38:16.935
six to eight years.
You'll serve four. Maybe.

38:17.298 --> 38:22.464
Reduced? But...
but I'm innocent.

38:23.769 --> 38:27.269
Ian, they've taken
three samples of your DNA.

38:27.290 --> 38:29.600
The chance of error is one
in ten billion.

38:29.610 --> 38:31.300
There aren't that
many people on the planet.

38:33.233 --> 38:34.438
We have your DNA.

39:06.693 --> 39:08.139
Jesus Christ.

39:22.157 --> 39:24.045
Jesus Christ.

39:25.170 --> 39:26.375
Am I free?

39:27.460 --> 39:28.946
Am I free?

39:28.981 --> 39:30.030
Still a suspect.

39:30.065 --> 39:31.757
Why is my brother still a suspect?

39:31.792 --> 39:33.524
We were at a wedding,
for Christ's sake.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.010
There's hundreds of witnesses.

39:40.268 --> 39:41.518
Hiya.

39:41.553 --> 39:43.512
Hi. How are you?

39:43.547 --> 39:44.782
Terrible.

39:44.917 --> 39:48.156
I was arrested yesterday
and I spent the night in a cell.

39:49.889 --> 39:53.418
They said I was connected
to some kind of child porn thing.

39:54.374 --> 39:55.972
I was arrested as well.

39:57.651 --> 39:59.809
Sexual assault.

39:59.844 --> 40:00.888
They had my DNA.

40:00.923 --> 40:03.685
Ian, do you think you could
come back here please?

40:03.720 --> 40:04.804
Why?

40:04.839 --> 40:07.042
Wilson Wilson,
he left me a message.

40:08.081 --> 40:09.839
Bejan killed himself.

40:18.270 --> 40:20.069
I don't want you to write this up.

40:20.104 --> 40:21.108
Jesus Christ.

40:21.143 --> 40:24.065
What I'm about to tell you,
don't write it up, promise me.

40:24.100 --> 40:26.502
All right, I won't write it up.

40:26.537 --> 40:28.341
Bejan wasn't depressed.

40:28.376 --> 40:31.258
Look, it's not unusual for people
like that to keep things quiet.

40:31.293 --> 40:34.415
According to his medical records,
he was on Mirtazepine last August.

40:34.420 --> 40:35.480
How do you know his medical records?

40:35.489 --> 40:37.532
I looked at the code
his records were written in.

40:37.566 --> 40:39.410
It's something called HL7.

40:39.445 --> 40:43.486
Well, a new patch was released
for HL7 12 days ago.

40:43.521 --> 40:47.761
Bejan's records go back to the '90s
and yet they have this correction.

40:47.796 --> 40:49.000
You've just committed a crime.

40:49.035 --> 40:50.039
Don't you see?

40:50.074 --> 40:52.956
His entire medical history was
written within the last two weeks.

40:52.991 --> 40:53.676
I'm supposed to arrest you now.

40:53.711 --> 40:56.273
Which is why I'm telling you
I knew Bejan, we were friends...

40:56.308 --> 40:58.950
I know you're upset
your friend's just died.

40:58.985 --> 41:01.987
But you need to go home
now before I change my mind.

41:02.022 --> 41:03.586
Don't make the report, please.

41:03.621 --> 41:04.625
I mean, if they can do that...

41:04.660 --> 41:05.664
Now!

41:43.387 --> 41:45.145
I've got to tell you some stuff.

41:46.344 --> 41:48.022
You better sit.

41:48.057 --> 41:52.578
I think this is about Utopia
and Mark Dane, the man that wrote it.

41:52.613 --> 41:55.774
Last year, I spoke to a nurse
who worked at Shenley

41:55.809 --> 41:57.293
when Mark Dane was there.

41:57.328 --> 41:59.531
She said he was a model patient,

41:59.566 --> 42:03.487
quiet, and they thought he must
have been some kind of geneticist

42:03.522 --> 42:06.324
but by the time they got to him,
his brain was fried.

42:07.923 --> 42:11.399
The only time he was ever trouble
was when they tried to give him

42:11.434 --> 42:14.756
a new brand of drug
and he went psycho.

42:14.791 --> 42:16.154
Hospitalised three men.

42:17.193 --> 42:19.951
The drugs were made by
a company called Corvadt.

42:19.986 --> 42:21.469
So?

42:21.504 --> 42:25.665
Right, in 2008, a researcher
at Berkeley called Norton wrote

42:25.700 --> 42:28.542
a paper into a new disease
called Deel's Syndrome.

42:28.577 --> 42:30.460
It's like Huntington's.

42:30.495 --> 42:34.137
It's a neurodegenerative disorder
where the entire body shuts down.

42:34.172 --> 42:36.295
And it's hereditary.

42:36.330 --> 42:38.133
But what Norton discovered

42:38.168 --> 42:41.529
is that Deel's has no
genetic history whatsoever.

42:41.564 --> 42:44.766
It's not present in parents,
relatives, nothing.

42:44.801 --> 42:47.643
It's like it just popped
into existence in 1986.

42:47.678 --> 42:50.601
– Is that possible?
No! Not really, no.

42:50.635 --> 42:54.437
So he thought that Deel's must
have been a man-made disease.

42:54.472 --> 42:57.793
So he looked into the patients'
backgrounds for a common denominator.

42:57.828 --> 42:59.352
Nothing.

42:59.387 --> 43:01.230
Except for one thing.

43:01.265 --> 43:04.827
They'd all at some point
worked for Corvadt.

43:04.861 --> 43:06.505
Why do you know all this?

43:12.779 --> 43:15.376
It's an image of the
genetic mutation in Deel's.

43:20.691 --> 43:22.010
Fuck.

43:23.608 --> 43:26.126
Hang on... So, what...

43:26.161 --> 43:29.043
if Dane was a geneticist, maybe he
saw this somewhere,

43:29.078 --> 43:30.561
drew it into Utopia.

43:30.596 --> 43:35.596
Yeah, only Utopia was published 1985
and this mutation didn't

43:35.631 --> 43:37.514
actually exist until 1989.

43:40.312 --> 43:41.470
No way.

43:41.505 --> 43:42.949
Fuck this. I mean...

43:42.984 --> 43:44.268
What has this got to do with me?

43:44.303 --> 43:45.427
Ian, please...

43:45.462 --> 43:46.585
I was in prison.

43:46.620 --> 43:48.863
They put me in a cell,
they... they accused me of rape.

43:48.898 --> 43:50.661
I think they're after the manuscript.

43:50.696 --> 43:53.858
Utopia Part Two. There must be
something in it that they want.

43:53.893 --> 43:55.976
Who the fuck are you?
Why do you know this?

43:58.574 --> 44:00.851
Because...

44:00.886 --> 44:02.570
my dad had Deel's.

44:03.928 --> 44:05.167
He died of it.

44:06.406 --> 44:07.765
It killed him.

44:21.911 --> 44:23.509
Look, do you want to sleep in there?

44:25.187 --> 44:27.305
I mean, just sleep?

44:31.142 --> 44:32.260
I'll take the chair.

45:34.959 --> 45:36.277
What do you want?

46:06.400 --> 46:09.836
I found out where Bejan got
the manuscript – Doomsday Comics.

46:09.871 --> 46:11.755
I looked it up online.

46:13.033 --> 46:15.031
Christ. What time is it?

46:15.066 --> 46:17.589
6:45. Sorry.

46:17.624 --> 46:19.707
Were you asleep?

46:32.214 --> 46:33.573
What do you want?

46:34.572 --> 46:36.011
You.

46:38.848 --> 46:42.484
... controversial decision to
spend £83 million on a vaccine

46:42.519 --> 46:43.843
for Russian flu.

46:43.878 --> 46:47.399
The Shadow Health Secretary branded
the decision beyond madness.

46:47.434 --> 46:50.716
The Public Health Minister,
Greg Ashby, hasn't been available

46:50.751 --> 46:53.753
for comment, but speculation
is mounting over the future...

46:53.788 --> 46:54.992
Out!

46:55.027 --> 46:56.351
Out, everyone!

47:04.463 --> 47:05.861
He...

47:06.900 --> 47:09.018
I asked if he wanted the vaccine.

47:09.053 --> 47:10.457
He said yes.

47:13.334 --> 47:15.052
He signed off on it.

47:16.171 --> 47:17.889
I thought he wanted it.

47:17.924 --> 47:19.368
He...

47:19.403 --> 47:20.447
He signed.

47:20.482 --> 47:22.325
He's fucking resigning, Michael.

47:22.360 --> 47:24.323
He's fucking losing his job!

47:37.270 --> 47:39.109
Do you think he's got it?

47:39.988 --> 47:41.666
Grant Latham's got it.

47:43.264 --> 47:44.583
Still...

47:44.618 --> 47:45.982
all this stuff.

47:47.580 --> 47:49.378
There's no trace of him online.

47:50.417 --> 47:52.655
People don't tend to hide
for no reason.

47:54.134 --> 47:55.772
He might know something.

48:00.128 --> 48:01.207
I'm...

48:01.242 --> 48:02.845
I'm going to cooperate.

48:06.561 --> 48:08.120
Whatever you want.

48:09.758 --> 48:13.155
I am going to cooperate...

48:14.953 --> 48:16.472
Argh!

48:18.390 --> 48:21.187
Most torturers tend to have
their favourite areas

48:21.222 --> 48:22.626
of the body to work on.

48:24.264 --> 48:27.341
Genitals, teeth...

48:29.299 --> 48:31.097
soles of the feet.

48:32.736 --> 48:34.174
With me...

48:36.652 --> 48:38.290
it's the eyes.

48:40.728 --> 48:42.726
chillies,

48:42.761 --> 48:45.004
sand,

48:45.039 --> 48:46.722
bleach.

48:48.520 --> 48:49.879
A spoon.

48:52.636 --> 48:54.874
Is this about Utopia?

48:54.909 --> 48:56.712
I'd didn't even know Bejan.

48:56.747 --> 49:00.149
I'm going to rub chillies
into your eyes,

49:00.184 --> 49:02.067
then sand,

49:02.102 --> 49:03.625
then bleach.

49:05.224 --> 49:06.982
Then I'm going to use the spoon.

49:08.620 --> 49:10.698
Do you know what
I do with the spoon?

49:12.177 --> 49:13.935
Where is Jessica Hyde?

49:22.327 --> 49:24.765
I don't know who that is.

49:40.389 --> 49:42.227
Can you still speak?

49:43.586 --> 49:44.825
Wilson?

49:55.614 --> 49:57.133
I've got sand now, Wilson.

50:00.809 --> 50:02.527
Where is Jessica Hyde?

50:04.925 --> 50:07.722
I swear to Christ
I don't know who that is.

50:07.757 --> 50:09.201
I've no idea.

50:15.954 --> 50:19.231
Argh! Argh! Argh!

50:20.669 --> 50:22.268
I've got the bleach now.

50:28.382 --> 50:30.340
Where is Jessica Hyde?

50:34.975 --> 50:36.134
She's...

50:37.493 --> 50:39.011
I've got her address.

50:40.330 --> 50:41.969
I can give you her address.

50:42.003 --> 50:43.407
Let me...

50:43.442 --> 50:44.966
No, no, no!

50:52.358 --> 50:55.076
I've got the spoon now, Wilson.

51:00.111 --> 51:02.149
Calm, calm, calm down.

51:03.707 --> 51:06.624
My mate is going to ask you
a question.

51:13.338 --> 51:14.337
Where...

51:15.735 --> 51:17.214
is Jessica Hyde?

51:23.647 --> 51:25.326
She's dead.

51:26.205 --> 51:27.564
She died.

51:30.241 --> 51:32.079
It was an accident.

51:34.956 --> 51:36.435
She died.

51:52.739 --> 51:54.657
He doesn't know anything.

51:56.135 --> 51:57.934
What about all this?

51:59.053 --> 52:00.371
He just...

52:01.490 --> 52:03.288
likes this stuff.

52:05.366 --> 52:07.005
You finish here.

52:07.040 --> 52:08.843
I've got to get back.

52:16.396 --> 52:17.634
I need a fag.

52:20.272 --> 52:21.630
Hello.

52:21.665 --> 52:23.269
I'm Geoff.

52:25.022 --> 52:27.984
It's never nice taking over
in these circumstances

52:28.019 --> 52:31.461
but just for the record,
there will be no shake up.

52:31.496 --> 52:33.419
Greg was doing good work.

52:33.454 --> 52:35.137
I'd like that to continue.

52:35.172 --> 52:36.935
So let's carry on.

52:36.970 --> 52:38.614
We'll get through this and...

52:40.532 --> 52:42.010
well, do good work.

52:47.885 --> 52:51.881
Uh... Michael, could you just
come with me, please?

53:00.552 --> 53:02.670
You raised the contracts.

53:02.705 --> 53:04.628
And you got Greg to sign off on it.

53:06.107 --> 53:08.984
Now, the buck stops with
the Minister, it always does,

53:09.019 --> 53:10.582
but privately he tells me

53:10.617 --> 53:13.060
he thought he was signing
the contract for rubella.

53:13.095 --> 53:15.737
No. I don't know why he thinks that.

53:18.375 --> 53:19.933
How is your wife, is she good?

53:22.051 --> 53:24.129
It's an ill wind.

53:24.164 --> 53:28.405
I need someone like you,
someone smart,

53:28.440 --> 53:31.362
someone who knows to do
the right things.

53:34.039 --> 53:35.558
What's it they say?

53:35.593 --> 53:37.795
Mission accomplished.

54:13.960 --> 54:16.198
It's 9:45. It should be open.

55:00.914 --> 55:03.591
Argh...

55:29.326 --> 55:30.724
They're all dead.

55:32.602 --> 55:34.401
It was a gas leak. Four of them.

55:36.279 --> 55:37.478
One was a kid.

55:42.553 --> 55:44.111
Hello?

55:54.541 --> 55:55.820
Jesus Christ!

55:59.376 --> 56:00.815
Oh, my God!

56:01.814 --> 56:03.812
Jesus Christ. Is that a gun?
Have you got a gun?

56:03.847 --> 56:05.210
Just go.

56:05.245 --> 56:06.729
Ian, he needs the hospital.

56:06.764 --> 56:08.048
Get out of here now.

56:08.082 --> 56:10.165
No, no hospital. No police.

56:10.200 --> 56:12.643
They'll kill me.
They could find us anywhere.

56:12.678 --> 56:14.361
Look, just go. Just go now.

56:18.198 --> 56:20.715
They kept asking me
the same question.

56:20.750 --> 56:23.952
Where's Jessica Hyde?
Where's Jessica Hyde?

56:23.987 --> 56:26.070
Who's Jessica Hyde?

56:29.275 --> 56:33.198
My dad. What about my dad?

56:34.335 --> 56:35.838
We'll call him or something.

56:37.452 --> 56:40.376
Ian, how do I look?

57:17.459 --> 57:19.257
I'm sorry, Michael.

57:26.730 --> 57:29.807
I'm so, so sorry.

57:38.159 --> 57:40.317
I've done all I can for his eye.

57:49.428 --> 57:51.865
Ian, he really needs a doctor.

57:51.900 --> 57:53.943
I mean, I just studied it.

58:13.764 --> 58:15.602
Don't answer.

58:22.515 --> 58:24.233
Don't answer!

58:52.067 --> 58:55.895
Hello. I'm Jessica Hyde.
