00:33.408 --> 00:36.445

from Uncle Sam himself.

00:38.497 --> 00:43.116
And when you pop the top,
the panties drop.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.789
Is that Anaconda Malt Liquor?

00:46.964 --> 00:51.082
The only malt liquor to be approved
by the United States government?

00:51.260 --> 00:54.502

l ain´t no snitch.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.630
Who said you were?

02:41.745 --> 02:42.734
He´s dead.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.707
My God, men.

02:49.086 --> 02:50.622
Do you know what this means?

02:51.254 --> 02:53.586
Do you know whose brother...?

02:54.424 --> 02:58.633
This ghetto is gonna be turned
upside-down, I tell you, upside-down.

02:58.804 --> 03:02.592
The streets are gonna run crimson
with the blood of the men...

03:02.766 --> 03:04.597
...responsible
for his brother's death.

03:04.768 --> 03:07.601
Man I am speaking of
is a veritable one-man army.

03:07.771 --> 03:10.638
And if you get on his bad side,
brother, you´re done for.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.102
lt´s only a matter of time
before he finds out...

03:13.276 --> 03:15.517
...and when he does,
no matter where he is...

03:15.696 --> 03:17.937
...get ready, gentlemen,
becaue hell´s a-coming.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.484
Coming, coming, coming.

03:30.877 --> 03:34.790
Black Dynamite,
that was the best loving I ever had.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.626
Me too.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.256
That goes triple for me.

03:38.802 --> 03:42.386
Mama, you´re gonna wake up
the rest of the bitches.

03:42.556 --> 03:46.925
I wanna tell you a story
about a friend l´ve had.

03:47.102 --> 03:50.310
He´s a mean motherfucker
and he´s super bad.

03:50.480 --> 03:54.268
So grab on to your seats
and hang on tight...

03:54.443 --> 03:57.480
...while l tell you a story
about Black Dynamite.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.303
Yeah?

04:29.478 --> 04:32.060
Dynamite, baby,
Nipsy still ain´t paid up.

04:32.230 --> 04:34.846
Solid. I´m on it, Bee.

04:44.868 --> 04:46.028
Who´s there?

04:46.203 --> 04:48.444
I´m looking for Nipsy.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.705
There´s no Nipsy here.

04:58.173 --> 04:59.959
Now, l´m gonna ask you
one more time.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.623
Where´s Nipsy?

05:01.802 --> 05:03.383
Here I am, sucker.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.087
Honeybee,
what´s happening, baby?

05:41.258 --> 05:44.625
Black Dynamite.
What did you do to Nipsy?

05:44.803 --> 05:47.886
Now, word on the street
is that he´s gonna be in traction.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.473
You know me. just talked to him.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.181
Thank you, Black Dynamite.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.891
l´m so happy.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.394
Hey, they mess with you, Mama,
they´re messing with me.

06:00.569 --> 06:03.481
Black Dynamite, l wanna thank you
for taking care of us girls...

06:03.655 --> 06:06.112
...while we was down and out
and didn´t have no pimp.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.486
Oh, I almost forgot.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.197
Ain´t nobody seen Pimpin´ Jake
for two days...

06:11.371 --> 06:13.783
...and he ain´t been by here
with your money.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.993
-And...
-I knew I forgot something.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.828
Tiny.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.085
Get Pimpin´ Jake out of my trunk.

06:20.255 --> 06:23.213
Tell him the rest by Wednesday
or l´ll make him stick himself.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.964
I´m sorry. Go on, Bee.

06:25.135 --> 06:28.969
They replaced the chain on your
nunchucks and oiled the bearing.

06:29.139 --> 06:32.927
They´re sitting there on your desk,
next to the dry cleaning.

06:49.367 --> 06:52.655
Allright. What´s wrong, Honeybee?

06:52.829 --> 06:54.660
l´ve known you too long.

06:54.831 --> 06:58.164
Now, if something´s bothering you,
why don´t you lay it on me?

06:58.335 --> 07:01.827
Black Dynamite.
I got to go to the hospital.

07:02.005 --> 07:04.963
lt´s my little nephew, Bucky.
He O.D.´d.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.417
Where is Bucky
and what has he had?

07:08.595 --> 07:10.677
lt´s that new drug on the street.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.680
All the kids are falling prey to it.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.301
What we gonna do,
Black Dynamite?

07:19.731 --> 07:21.687
l know what l´m gonna do.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.644
I´m gonna fight.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.683
The only way l know how.

07:25.862 --> 07:29.480
Ever since l was a boy,
all I knew was how to fight.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.273
Fight, fight, fight.

07:31.451 --> 07:35.535
And when l got tired,
I would fight some more.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.538
And now that the Man
has got our backs to the wall...

07:38.708 --> 07:41.245
...l ain´t gonna let him hurt the kids.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.622
l´m gonna take him down.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.539
l´m gonna take them all  down.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.686
Who the hell is interrupting
my Kung Fu?

08:50.530 --> 08:54.990
-Who the hell is this?
-Black Dynamite, it´s your aunt Billy.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.242
How many times
I told you not to call here...

08:57.412 --> 08:58.697
...and interrupt my Kung Fu?

08:58.872 --> 09:01.284
lt´s bad news, Dynamite.

09:01.458 --> 09:04.120
lt´s your only brother, Jimmy.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.618
He´s dead, Dynamite.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.787
Jimmy´s dead.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.001
Scram.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.544
l said split.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.213
Shake the scene, you turkeys.
Get ut of my house.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.382
l´ll see you all tomorrow.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.139
How did it happen, aunt Billy?

09:23.313 --> 09:27.226
They found him shot full of holes
in an old shipping yard.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.890
Dead as a dog.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.355
Said he had drugs on him.

09:31.529 --> 09:34.362
I guess he was still on that stuff.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.820
Now, l thought you promised
your mama on her deathbed...

09:37.994 --> 09:41.703
...you was gonna get him
off that stuff, Black Dynamite.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.909
Whoever did this is gonna pay.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.574
l can promise you that.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.539
Well, l hope it ain´t like
when you promised your mama...

09:48.713 --> 09:50.829
...you was gonna get him
off of that stuff...

09:51.007 --> 09:53.749
...for the rest of his natural life...

10:02.018 --> 10:07.433
Black Dynamite,
I want you to promise me...

10:07.607 --> 10:10.394
...that you´ll look after your brother...

10:10.568 --> 10:15.983
...and make sure
he doesn´t end up on drugs...

10:16.157 --> 10:18.113
...or dead.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.447
l promise.

10:23.915 --> 10:26.907
Jimmy, l am 18-year-old
Black Dynamite...

10:27.085 --> 10:29.371
...and you are my 16-year-old
kid brother...

10:29.546 --> 10:32.288
...and you are high
as a kite yet again.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.247
Who gave you the drugs, Jimmy?

10:34.425 --> 10:35.790
Who?

10:50.525 --> 10:52.891
Your mama would turn over
in her grave...

10:53.069 --> 10:55.560
... if she were here to see this.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.901
She loved Jimmy with all her heart.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.613
You promised your mama
on her deathbed...

11:02.787 --> 11:04.903
...that you would look after Jimmy.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.572
Now he´s dead.

11:14.549 --> 11:17.461
l scoured the crime scene
like you told me to.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.463
Dig what I found.

11:23.725 --> 11:27.638
Now, this is some heay shit.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.009
Freeze, turkeys.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.684
l see you haven´t lost your touch,
B.D.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.890
O'Leary?

12:18.988 --> 12:22.651
The old " pie on the windowsill " trick.
l can´t believe l fell for that.

12:23.034 --> 12:26.401
That was the same trap you used
in Nam to save my ass.

12:27.330 --> 12:30.493
B.D. took our fatigues
and put them on two dead gooks.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.953
l remember we circled back
and turned the tables.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.789
I guess you forgot about the time
you and Bravo company...

12:35.964 --> 12:38.171
...left my black ass for dead, uh?

12:38.549 --> 12:40.460
But l remember.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.921
l remember everything.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.257
l remember Vietnam
like it was yesterday.

12:46.057 --> 12:50.346
l remember that village
in Tai Nan that we cut down.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.310
It was a massacre.

12:54.357 --> 12:57.690
All the dead Chinamen
we left in our tracks.

12:57.860 --> 13:01.694
I remember the faces, the children.

13:02.031 --> 13:04.773
This one child I´ll never forget.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.655
Poor little bastard was still alive.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.821
His little Chinese legs
were blown clean off.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.739
Still see his little shins and feet...

13:12.917 --> 13:15.329
...hanging from the ceiling fan
across the hut.

13:15.503 --> 13:19.917
He was charred from his head down
to his little Chinese knees.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.006
He tried to get up...

13:23.344 --> 13:26.632
...but he fell over when what was left
of his right leg broke off.

13:28.057 --> 13:31.925
As he laid there flat on his face...

13:32.103 --> 13:34.264
...he looked up at me.

13:34.439 --> 13:37.226
His little Chinese eyes
burned right into my stomach...

13:37.400 --> 13:39.561
...deep into my soul.

13:39.986 --> 13:43.524
He said something to me
in Chinese, like...

13:43.698 --> 13:45.154
Sounds like some cartoon shit...

13:45.325 --> 13:48.408
...but l understood it to be a question
that he was asking me.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.785
And l don´t have to know
how to speak Chinese...

13:50.955 --> 13:53.196
...to know what that question was.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.911
'' Why, Black Dynamite?...

13:56.085 --> 13:57.666
...why? ''

14:03.092 --> 14:04.957
We´re a long way from Nam.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.171
Look at this place.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.008
lt must have an eight-track player
in every room.

14:09.182 --> 14:14.051
What´s going on today
is a smack problem of epic proportion.

14:14.228 --> 14:17.812
Corruption is running rampant
and we don´t know who to trust.

14:18.775 --> 14:22.267
We need you, Black Dynamite,
now more than ever.

14:22.445 --> 14:26.609
l know l was the best ClA agent
that the ClA ever had...

14:26.783 --> 14:29.115
...but l thought l told you honkies
from the ClA...

14:29.285 --> 14:31.276
...that Black Dynamite
was out of the game.

14:31.496 --> 14:35.535
-You´re never out of the game.
-l´ve known you for a long time.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.949
And there´s something
that you´re not telling me.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.124
Okay.

14:42.673 --> 14:45.540
We heard about your brother´s death.
The last thing we need...

14:45.718 --> 14:48.630
... is you running through the streets
creating a river of blood.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.171
Tell me who did it
and I´ll just leave a puddle.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.089
We don´t know who killed Jimmy.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.258
But l do know this.

14:55.561 --> 14:59.270
You step out of line, friendship or not,
and l´m gonna take you down.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.556
In case you forgot,
when you left the agency...

15:01.734 --> 15:03.599
...you relinquished
your license to kill.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.643
Well, you do what you have to.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.154
Just don´t get in my way.

15:46.070 --> 15:50.689
Come on, give it up
to Afrodite and the Moonchild.

15:50.867 --> 15:54.280
Give them a nice round of applause,
big round of applause, yeah.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.995
Black Dynamite,
you came to see me.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.578
Bitch, no, l gotta go rap a taste
with my man Horn...

16:00.751 --> 16:04.039
...but afterwards since I´m here,
maybe l´ll throw you one right quick.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.537
Out of sight.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.957
I get off in 15 minutes.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.466
You´re right about that, sugar.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.047
You´re right about that.

16:16.642 --> 16:20.055
But Horn, can I get you anything?

16:20.229 --> 16:23.471
Yes. I would like some of that ass.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.809
Yes, yes, yes.

16:31.032 --> 16:35.901
Man, who dare knock
when I´m planning to plant my...?

16:36.078 --> 16:39.036
Main man Black Dynamite.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.909
What it is, Bullhorn?

16:41.083 --> 16:42.573
What you want to eat, man?

16:42.752 --> 16:46.290
Sister Betty made some hog maws
and, man, she put her ankle in it.

16:47.256 --> 16:50.089
I ain´t here for no food, Horn.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.918
Oh, man.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.882
l can dig it.

16:56.057 --> 16:59.390
Sugar, give us a minute.

17:06.526 --> 17:07.935
You know, man...

17:08.109 --> 17:11.102
...l´m really sorry to hear
about what happened to Jimmy.

17:12.490 --> 17:15.277
You know, me and you
been tight for a long time.

17:15.451 --> 17:19.364
-So you know if you need anything....
-Thanks, Horn.

17:19.789 --> 17:23.031
I need to know about the kind of cats
that Jimmy was running with.

17:23.209 --> 17:26.076
You know, he came around here
about a week ago...

17:26.253 --> 17:29.587
...with some cats
that l had never seen before.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.580
Man, l mean,
these cats looked mean.

17:31.759 --> 17:35.047
Meaner than two fat moterfuckers
wrestling over pork cops and greens.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.836
Can you dig it?

17:38.140 --> 17:41.257
Yeah. l can dig it.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.723
That little old half-a-player,
Cream Corn, was with them.

17:49.318 --> 17:50.808
You remember Cream Corn.

17:53.656 --> 17:57.820
So where is Cream Corn
these days?

17:57.994 --> 17:59.325
Yep, that´s right.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.655
l´m running things.

18:03.374 --> 18:05.740
Cream Corn.
That´s why they call me that.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.078
Smooth.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.877
I got my measure for your pleasure.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.834
Stick with me, baby,
l´ll have you farting through silk.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.465
And let a nigga mess with me.

18:14.635 --> 18:19.504
I´ll  jump on him,
all 93 pounds of pure dynamite...

19:14.236 --> 19:16.147
Let me catch my breath,
Black Dynamite.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.858
Shut up, sucker. I need answers.

19:18.032 --> 19:20.865
l wanna know who the cats were
that Jimmy was hanging with.

19:21.035 --> 19:23.151
Man, l don´t know nothing
'bout nothing.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.411
Okay, allright, allright.

19:25.581 --> 19:28.072
Their leader´s name
is Chicago Wind.

19:28.250 --> 19:32.084
They hang out at a place
called the Hip Pocket on Crenshaw.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.085
Now, get me up.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.516
So you must be Black Dynamite.

19:53.442 --> 19:56.775
Cream Corn, you jive mother.

20:02.785 --> 20:05.117
Chicago Wind, I presume.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.528
Your presumption is correct, nigga.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.790
If you presume that I killed
your broter then you presume wrong.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.700
Not that it means shit to me.

20:12.878 --> 20:16.245
Either way, shit.

20:16.424 --> 20:19.382
l wish l´d have killed
that nigga myself.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.542
Somebody else beat me to it.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.302
Is that so?

20:23.472 --> 20:25.804
Well, Mr. Cicago Wind...

20:26.308 --> 20:28.594
...what do you know about this?

20:32.523 --> 20:34.479
Some heavy shit.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.811
But dig.

20:38.070 --> 20:41.312
Let me explain something to you,
supernigga.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.314
l don´t answer questions.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.403
l ask them.

20:46.662 --> 20:49.153
Even if I did know wo killed
that brother of yours...

20:49.331 --> 20:52.164
...what would make you think
I´m gonna tell you?

20:53.586 --> 20:57.124
Get your black ass out of my joint...

20:57.298 --> 20:59.505
...before we beat you
like a rented mule.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.928
That´s right, you jive-ass punk.

21:07.141 --> 21:09.928
Don´t be coming to the Hip Pocket
talking that shit, you dig?

21:10.102 --> 21:13.390
That´s right, nigga.
Don´t ever, ever come back.

22:36.397 --> 22:39.104
Go catch Chicago Wind
before he disappears.

22:39.275 --> 22:42.108
I´ll take care
of this gorilla-eating goon here.

22:46.615 --> 22:51.029
Oh, you´s a corn-fed fool
with a lot of muscle mass.

22:51.203 --> 22:56.288
But it´s time for Bullhorn
to get up in that ass.

23:02.006 --> 23:03.291
Motherfucker.

23:09.638 --> 23:12.971
Let everybody know
and suckers be warned...

23:13.142 --> 23:17.886
...that this is the outcome
when you mess with Bullhorn.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.655
Try to catch me now, sucker.

23:40.002 --> 23:41.663
Motherfucker.

23:48.093 --> 23:51.677
Now you know why they call me
Chicago Wind, fool.

23:51.847 --> 23:55.886
Because I left your ass
blowing in the breeze.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.722
Man, don´t you ever, ever....

24:09.156 --> 24:12.899
That black son of a bitch,
he killed my best dealer.

24:13.077 --> 24:19.289
l want Black Dynamite dead,
and I want him dead now.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.291
Before you support
any of these candidates...

24:22.461 --> 24:25.794
...find out if they´re going to rid
our communities...

24:25.965 --> 24:28.251
...of the hustlers and pushers.

24:28.425 --> 24:31.758
Or are they gonna destroy all
the programs that help our children...

24:31.929 --> 24:36.889
...and give their corporate friends
free reign to exploit our community...

24:37.059 --> 24:38.299
...like congressman James.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.642
Watch me turn this shit around.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.394
Power to the people.

24:43.857 --> 24:46.815
With a due respect
to the young sister here...

24:47.403 --> 24:48.643
...you all know me.

24:48.862 --> 24:49.897
Yes.

24:50.072 --> 24:51.653
Now, young lady...

24:51.824 --> 24:55.408
...these fine folks
don´t need to be misled.

24:55.577 --> 24:57.613
All they want is a little bit of bread.

24:59.331 --> 25:02.664
And you can´t just stick it
to the Man.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.121
You also
got to have yourself a plan.

25:06.380 --> 25:12.000
Now, we got to take this
from the jukebox to the ballot box.

25:12.469 --> 25:16.929
We got to go from the poor house
to the White House.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.841
Instead of imagining me...

25:20.019 --> 25:24.513
...let´s take this land
from sea to shining sea.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.268
Keep the faith, broters and sisters.

25:35.451 --> 25:38.193
Say, Mama, you´re gonna have
to work on your delivery...

25:38.370 --> 25:40.611
... if you wanna take on
congressman James.

25:40.789 --> 25:44.122
The shame is, half these people
don´t know what y´all talking about...

25:44.293 --> 25:46.909
...but at least they can put this
to a beat.

25:47.504 --> 25:49.335
So, what do you do
to make a difference?

25:49.506 --> 25:52.168
Do you march? Do you vote?

25:52.342 --> 25:53.582
Oh, let me guess.

25:53.761 --> 25:55.376
You´re one of Tom Slick brothers...

25:55.554 --> 25:58.466
...think you can get by on good looks,
a wink and a smile, huh?

25:58.640 --> 26:00.631
I don´t know about Tom Slick.

26:00.809 --> 26:02.390
But thank you for the compliments.

26:03.312 --> 26:04.427
That´s not what I meant.

26:04.605 --> 26:06.561
Not that l think
that you have good look...

26:06.732 --> 26:09.348
l mean, you know these guys
with their...

26:09.526 --> 26:12.643
-Winks and smiles.
-Yeah.

26:15.032 --> 26:16.488
What about the smile?

26:17.117 --> 26:19.153
l am smiling.

26:45.479 --> 26:47.561
Right on, right on.

26:55.197 --> 26:56.983
Excuse me, brothers.

26:57.157 --> 26:59.273
The militants turn startled.

26:59.451 --> 27:00.486
This is private.

27:00.661 --> 27:02.367
How´d you get in here?

27:02.538 --> 27:04.028
l walked in.

27:04.206 --> 27:06.868
So you one of them
sneaky brothers, uh?

27:07.042 --> 27:09.124
Or maybe you´re an undercover pig.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.785
Or maybe you´re just a federal hit man.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.956
If I was,
you cats would allready be dead.

27:15.384 --> 27:18.046
Now, let me speak
to the man in charge.

27:18.220 --> 27:20.882
Sarcastically, I´m in charge.

27:21.056 --> 27:22.546
Right on.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.631
If you were in charge...

27:24.810 --> 27:27.552
...the people might as well surrender
to whitey right now...

27:27.729 --> 27:30.391
...because your survival skills
ain´t worth a damn.

27:30.566 --> 27:32.682
Black Dynamite.

27:34.027 --> 27:36.063
lt has been a long time, my brother.

27:36.947 --> 27:38.403
What it is, Saheed?

27:38.574 --> 27:41.111
You know this Uncle Tom?

27:41.285 --> 27:42.900
Listen, sucker.

27:43.078 --> 27:45.615
l´m blacker than the ace of spades
and more militant...

27:45.789 --> 27:48.496
...than you and your whole damn army
put together.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.998
And while you´re out there...

27:50.169 --> 27:52.581
...chanting at rallies
and browbeating politicians...

27:52.754 --> 27:55.291
...l´m taking out any money
front sucker on a humble...

27:55.465 --> 27:56.545
...that gets in my way.

27:56.717 --> 27:58.423
So I´ll tell you what.

27:58.594 --> 28:01.882
When your so-called revolution starts,
you call me...

28:02.055 --> 28:04.797
...and I´ll be right down front
showing you how it´s done...

28:04.975 --> 28:07.261
...but until then,
you need to shut the fuck up...

28:07.436 --> 28:09.142
...when grown folks is talking.

28:14.109 --> 28:15.770
l´m sorry.

28:17.279 --> 28:20.237
Yeah, we heard about
what went down at the Hip Pocket.

28:20.407 --> 28:22.443
That was righteous.

28:22.618 --> 28:24.654
That was personal, brother.

28:25.454 --> 28:29.163
Personal or not, you saved
a lot of brothers and sisters.

28:29.333 --> 28:32.825
You need our help, we´re here.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.209
l can dig it.

28:36.965 --> 28:39.547
What can you tell me about this?

28:40.552 --> 28:42.042
Yeah.

28:44.973 --> 28:47.259
I ain´t seen one of these in a while.

28:49.853 --> 28:52.310
I was gonna fuck him up.

29:06.954 --> 29:08.569
There it is.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.787
AR-48.

29:10.958 --> 29:12.823
l wish we could get
some shit like this.

29:13.001 --> 29:16.619
That round will go through
a bulletproof vest like it was a pillow.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.171
Any idea who would have it?

29:19.341 --> 29:22.754
Whoever it is,
he must work for the Man...

29:22.928 --> 29:26.716
...because that right there
is strictly government issue.

29:40.153 --> 29:42.109
You mind telling me
how this was found...

29:42.281 --> 29:44.442
...at the scene
of my broter´s death?

29:52.749 --> 29:54.740
Okay, Black Dynamite.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.908
Want me to level with you?

29:57.212 --> 29:59.703
Your brother Jimmy
wasn´t a two-bit drug dealer.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.872
-He was one of us.
-What?

30:02.050 --> 30:04.211
He was working undercover.

30:04.594 --> 30:06.710
And he wanted to be just like you.

30:11.393 --> 30:14.885
Jimmy, why didn´t you tell me?

30:18.400 --> 30:19.856
Vincent Rafelli.

30:20.027 --> 30:22.439
Don of the Carbozi family.

30:24.239 --> 30:26.070
Heads up a shipping company.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.607
We believe he´s distributing dope.

30:28.785 --> 30:31.242
Jimmy felt that the Don
and congressman James...

30:31.413 --> 30:33.369
...had something up their sleeve.

30:33.540 --> 30:35.576
He didn´t quite know what it was.

30:35.751 --> 30:37.742
He died trying to find out.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.871
So I don´t need to tell you
the importance of this mission.

30:42.049 --> 30:43.960
But l just have one question.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.500
Are you in or are you out?

30:46.928 --> 30:49.965
Because God knows
you´re the only one we can trust.

30:53.268 --> 30:54.849
l´m in.

30:56.813 --> 30:58.178
Good.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.932
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

31:02.694 --> 31:03.729
Hope you don´t mind.

31:03.904 --> 31:06.441
l took the liberty
of reinstating your license to kill.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.947
You´re gonna need this.

31:19.503 --> 31:21.494
Black Dynamite´s looking for us.

31:21.671 --> 31:23.161
You said you would handle it.

31:24.216 --> 31:27.629
l´m bringing in
the heavy hitters now.

31:31.181 --> 31:34.799
Somebody broke into
my dead brotherJimmy´s apartment.

32:29.698 --> 32:31.563
Breathe deeply, baby.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.403
Daddy, you make my heart beat.

32:34.870 --> 32:37.987
Yeah, Dr. Dynamite can hear that.

32:38.331 --> 32:40.196
But l think
you´re running a temperature.

32:40.625 --> 32:44.834
Let me see if I can find
a thermometer for you.

32:46.339 --> 32:48.455
What the...

32:49.050 --> 32:53.259
l told you urine sample,
nurse Jenny.

32:53.513 --> 32:55.378
Black Dynamite.

32:55.557 --> 32:58.048
l mean, really.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.137
You sent her in here
with them titties.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.927
What did you expect?

33:02.105 --> 33:03.470
How´s my x-ray?

33:03.648 --> 33:05.058
Well, no fragments.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.689
ln and out.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.566
You´re lucky, Black Dynamite.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.728
Three inches to the left...

33:10.906 --> 33:13.397
...and we wouldn´t even be having
this conversation.

33:13.575 --> 33:16.487
Three inches to the right,
it would´ve missed my black ass.

33:16.661 --> 33:19.243
Well, you need a new line of work.

33:19.414 --> 33:21.655
This is the second time this year.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.745
I know, I know.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.753
Wy do I bother?
There´s no helping you.

33:27.923 --> 33:30.756
No, Doc, you help me just fine.

33:30.926 --> 33:32.086
See you next time.

33:36.890 --> 33:39.347
You hang in there, Leon.
You hear me?

33:50.403 --> 33:52.894
Hey, Mama, what´s going down?
That´s your kid in there?

33:53.073 --> 33:54.529
No.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.281
Nephew? Cousin?

33:56.451 --> 33:57.907
l said no.

33:58.078 --> 34:00.194
No relation, he....

34:00.372 --> 34:03.284
He happens to be one of the kids
at the orphanage where l work.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.995
He overdosed on smack.
Third one this month.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.793
And why?
What does it matter to you anyway?

34:08.964 --> 34:11.295
Whoa, Mama, just trying to help.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.085
Oh, I don´t need your kind of help.

34:14.261 --> 34:17.047
Men like you only help
when there´s something in it for them.

34:17.222 --> 34:18.462
They can´t be bothered.

34:18.639 --> 34:22.757
Too busy chasing their chicks
and their bread and their fancy car.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.141
No, Mr. Black Dynamite.

34:24.312 --> 34:27.475
The only help you know
is how to help yourself.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.014
Whoa, Mama, it ain´t about me.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.808
lt´s about that kid in there.

34:32.152 --> 34:33.563
Now do you really want help...

34:33.780 --> 34:37.398
...or are you just trying to prove to the
world you can do it all on your own?

34:37.867 --> 34:39.072
Mama always said:

34:39.244 --> 34:42.031
" A helping hand is a helping hand,
clean or dirty.''

34:42.205 --> 34:44.992
Guess my hands
ain´t clean enough for you.

34:48.335 --> 34:49.371
Wait.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.045
These politicians don´t give a damn.

34:54.217 --> 34:57.050
I mean, look, look at these ads.

34:58.471 --> 35:00.757
Congressman James
made promises to the people.

35:00.932 --> 35:03.139
Then he took away
his drug-awareness programs...

35:03.310 --> 35:06.177
...and allowed his bedfellows
to sell crack to the kids.

35:06.354 --> 35:08.015
He´d been invested in these products.

35:08.189 --> 35:10.430
Now the dope is everywhere.
lt´s even...

35:10.609 --> 35:12.065
lt´s even in the orphanage.

35:13.361 --> 35:15.443
Not the orphanage.

35:17.032 --> 35:19.569
l used to be an orphan.

35:20.702 --> 35:22.943
You ain´t got no mommy
and you ain´t got no daddy.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.201
You´re an orphan.

35:24.372 --> 35:28.411
Orpan, orphan, orphan.

35:32.005 --> 35:34.212
No, not the orphans.

35:37.385 --> 35:39.296
l think l need
to show you something.

35:41.222 --> 35:44.214
We´ve been trying
to reach these children.

35:44.392 --> 35:47.725
But this new smack on the street
is proving too much of a match for us.

35:48.897 --> 35:51.559
The worst thing
about these pushers...

35:51.733 --> 35:54.270
...getting these children
addicted to this new smack...

35:54.444 --> 35:58.528
...is that these children are orphans,
and orpans don´t have parents.

35:59.741 --> 36:02.403
Ain´t nothing in the world
get Black Dynamite more mad...

36:02.577 --> 36:05.159
...than some jive-ass sucker
dealing smack to the kids.

36:05.914 --> 36:07.495
Bobby, stop it.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.702
You´ll kick soon.

36:13.797 --> 36:15.128
You dealing, broter?

36:15.298 --> 36:16.959
l need my smack, l need it now.

36:17.175 --> 36:21.259
Put a few of these honeys on the street
and l´ll get you your bread, partner.

36:22.931 --> 36:25.217
l refuse to let this happen to you,
little man.

36:25.392 --> 36:28.259
l will shake this poisonous shit
out of your smacked-up body...

36:28.436 --> 36:29.471
... if I have to.

36:29.646 --> 36:32.934
Black Dynamite, stop.
We´ve tried that, nothing works.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.855
l can´t look at these kids no more.

36:40.824 --> 36:43.861
This orphanage used to be alive
with laughter, kids playing.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.491
Now look at it, it´s sickening.

36:45.662 --> 36:48.654
Whoever´s responsible is gonna pay,
if it´s the last thing I do.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.743
Black Dynamite,
I wish it was that simpIe.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.953
But this is much bigger
than you and me.

36:53.128 --> 36:54.117
Hey, Little Mama.

36:54.295 --> 36:56.957
lt may be bigger than you
and it may be bigger than me.

36:57.132 --> 36:59.589
But it ain´t bigger than you and me.
Can you dig it?

36:59.759 --> 37:00.965
l think so.

37:01.970 --> 37:03.130
l gotta split.

37:03.304 --> 37:05.044
You need me to drop you off
somewhere?

37:05.223 --> 37:07.839
No, l think l´m gonna go down
the street and grab a bite.

37:08.017 --> 37:09.632
l´ll drive you.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.810
Thanks for the ride.

37:36.421 --> 37:38.582
Can I get some hot sauce
for my donut?

37:38.757 --> 37:39.837
Excuse me, lady.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.597
-Oh, my God.
-What is it? What´s going on?

37:49.768 --> 37:51.599
How did you know?

37:51.770 --> 37:55.513
Donuts don´t wear alligator shoes.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.995
Damn.

38:36.231 --> 38:37.266
Sorry, Roscoe.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.226
It´s cool, man.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.563
Chili and donuts ain´t working out
for me nohow.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.443
Maybe it´s time for a change.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.239
What have you gotten me into?

38:48.409 --> 38:50.115
It wasn´t me they were after, sugar.

38:50.286 --> 38:53.744
You must have pissed off some people
in some pretty high places.

38:54.582 --> 38:57.324
l´m gonna take you somewhere
you´ll be safe.

38:58.545 --> 39:01.002
Black Dynamite,
you ain´t got to worry about Gloria.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.254
She´s gonna be safe up in here.

39:03.424 --> 39:06.416
l´ve been keeping the girls up
on their Kung Fu like you told me to.

39:06.594 --> 39:11.429
Now, they find her up in here,
we will fricassee their honky asses.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.474
You sure about this?
Maybe we should call the police.

39:15.645 --> 39:18.682
No, Mama. You can bet
your sweet ass and half a titty...

39:18.857 --> 39:22.520
...whoever put that hit on you, already
got the cops in their back pocket.

39:23.236 --> 39:24.567
You be cool, Mama.

39:24.737 --> 39:26.944
Be here will keep you tight
and out of sight.

39:27.115 --> 39:30.778
l´m gonna shake the tree
from the root and rake up the fruits...

39:31.286 --> 39:34.574
...rip it up out the ground.
find out what´s going down.

39:34.747 --> 39:37.363
Don´t worry about tomorrow, Mama,
because tonight...

39:37.542 --> 39:40.284
Dynamite´s gonna make
everyting allrigt.

39:40.461 --> 39:42.201
Euphoria. shut up.
I know that was you.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.460
l ain´t even gotta look.

39:43.631 --> 39:46.623
I should send you to Crensaw Pete
with his hot-ass coat hangers.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.211
Would you like that?

40:00.523 --> 40:02.605
Black Dynamite,
I know that we just met...

40:02.775 --> 40:05.141
...but somehow I feel
that I can trust you.

40:06.321 --> 40:08.562
l´ll be here waiting
till you come to get me.

40:11.367 --> 40:13.403
Thank you for saving my life.

40:14.579 --> 40:16.194
You be cool, Little Mama.

40:16.372 --> 40:18.829
I´ll be back before too long.

40:33.806 --> 40:36.718
Order, order, order.

40:37.518 --> 40:38.553
Order, nigga.

40:41.356 --> 40:44.473
The game is at an all-time low.

40:45.860 --> 40:49.853
Never in the history of the game
has there been such devastation.

40:50.031 --> 40:51.066
-That´s right.
-Yeah.

40:51.240 --> 40:54.732
Tricks running low,
cops pushing harder than ever.

40:54.911 --> 40:55.946
-Yeah.
-That´s right.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.951
These little bitches just running wild.

40:58.122 --> 41:01.535
l thought we had
these poop-butt pigs paid off.

41:01.709 --> 41:02.915
-Come to find out.
-Yeah.

41:03.086 --> 41:05.623
They trapping my ho´s
every time they hit the track.

41:06.381 --> 41:10.124
l´m spending more bail money
than I´m getting tail money.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.713
Yeah. yeah.
I can dig it, Chocolate, I can dig it.

41:12.887 --> 41:15.594
Come on, this has been
my worst physical year ever.

41:15.765 --> 41:17.301
Fiscal, nigga. With a " F ", fiscal.

41:17.475 --> 41:21.343
Well, it´s been the worst one ever.
I can´t even afford to get my hair fixed.

41:21.521 --> 41:23.227
Sounds like you´re assed out.

41:23.398 --> 41:24.683
You know what they say.

41:24.857 --> 41:26.563
The bitch won´t se her ass.

41:26.734 --> 41:29.066
-A pimp will.
-Will.

41:29.237 --> 41:30.397
Shut up, Tasty.

41:32.448 --> 41:34.029
l turned you onto the game...

41:34.200 --> 41:36.566
...when you nothing
but a little jailhouse tramp.

41:38.955 --> 41:40.741
Now, listen up.

41:42.000 --> 41:46.460
Pimping has been around
since the world started turning.

41:46.629 --> 41:50.588
And it´s going to keep right on
turning right along with it...

41:50.925 --> 41:55.419
...until this little planet
rotates off its axis...

41:55.596 --> 42:01.842
...as a result of it´s core overheating
and explodes into cosmic dust.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.180
Damn.

42:03.354 --> 42:05.310
-Can you dig it?
-It´s done, brother.

42:05.481 --> 42:06.937
You know what I´m saying?

42:07.316 --> 42:09.602
Now look here.
These times, they come and they go.

42:09.777 --> 42:12.143
-Right.
-And if you live long enough...

42:12.321 --> 42:14.903
...you´ll  be around
to see them come again.

42:15.324 --> 42:20.944
But what we need to do
is we need to collectivizise.

42:21.122 --> 42:22.953
-Yeah.
-Right on, right on.

42:23.124 --> 42:24.739
Now, look here.

42:25.418 --> 42:26.908
Listen.

42:27.086 --> 42:30.374
Stop all the bullshit and take a vote.

42:31.632 --> 42:33.463
Yes, O.

42:34.802 --> 42:36.633
All in favor, raise your hand.

42:37.263 --> 42:38.969
Kotex?

42:39.307 --> 42:42.265
-Mo Bitches?
-l can dig it, baby.

42:42.435 --> 42:43.766
Chocolate Giddy-Up?

42:43.936 --> 42:46.302
Chocolate Giddy-Up.

42:46.481 --> 42:47.971
Crenshaw Pete?

42:49.150 --> 42:50.811
Captain Kangaroo Pimp?

42:53.196 --> 42:55.528
-Willie?
-l´m with you.

42:55.698 --> 42:59.316
Nigga, even if they don´t
knock the broads...

43:00.036 --> 43:04.120
...there ain´t enough tricks
to go around.

43:05.833 --> 43:07.414
Now, look here.

43:07.752 --> 43:09.959
I don´t know about the rest of y´all.

43:10.421 --> 43:12.662
But it looks like l have
to keep selling heroin...

43:12.840 --> 43:14.046
...just to make ends meet.

43:14.217 --> 43:16.333
Then you´ll have
a much bigger problem.

43:16.511 --> 43:18.047
Black Dynamite.

43:18.221 --> 43:19.961
What´s happening, baby?

43:20.139 --> 43:21.299
What it is, Big O?

43:21.474 --> 43:24.841
To what do we owe this pleasure?

43:25.019 --> 43:28.011
l just got one thing to lay on you cats
and then I´ll split.

43:28.189 --> 43:29.850
That l´m declaring war...

43:30.024 --> 43:32.857
...on anybody who sells drugs
in our community.

43:33.027 --> 43:37.270
But, Black Dynamite,
I sell drugs to the community.

43:37.448 --> 43:40.736
Well, be that as it may,
if I catch you...

43:40.910 --> 43:43.026
...l will not consider you
a brother or friend.

43:43.204 --> 43:44.694
Now, can you dig it?

43:44.872 --> 43:47.079
Hell no, nigga.

43:48.042 --> 43:50.249
l can´t dig it.

43:50.711 --> 43:53.293
-Now who you supposed to be?
-That´s Black Dynamite.

43:53.464 --> 43:55.375
I ain´t ask you, nigga. Shut up.

43:55.550 --> 43:57.882
l´m gonna tell you like this.

43:58.052 --> 44:01.715
l´m gonna do whatever l wanna do.

44:02.640 --> 44:05.723
-Yeah.
-Well , the choice is yours, brother.

44:05.893 --> 44:07.849
But if me and my people
catch you...

44:08.020 --> 44:10.682
...you´re gonna have
a lot more to deal with.

44:10.857 --> 44:13.269
-Good evening, gentlemen.
-Goodbye, Black Dynamite.

44:13.442 --> 44:16.149
Will you stop that...?

44:22.994 --> 44:24.109
Hold it right there.

44:25.329 --> 44:26.489
lt´s me, Black Dynamite.

44:26.664 --> 44:29.246
-What the hell do you want?
-l wanna help you.

44:29.417 --> 44:30.577
Why should l trust you...

44:30.751 --> 44:32.992
...after you dropped dime on me
to Chicago Wind?

44:33.629 --> 44:36.211
Because your brother Jimmy
saved my life.

44:36.382 --> 44:38.919
l was supposed to be with him
the night he got killed.

44:39.552 --> 44:42.635
But he called me
and told me to stay at home.

44:42.805 --> 44:44.341
l guess I owe him one.

44:48.102 --> 44:50.718
I need a list
of names and locations.

44:50.897 --> 44:51.932
Ain´t no thing.

44:52.315 --> 44:54.897
Man, everything is gonna be okay.

44:55.067 --> 44:56.432
Bull Horn...

44:56.611 --> 45:00.274
...Cream Corn here says he can
help us find the cats we´re looking for.

45:00.448 --> 45:02.188
Now, what do you think?

45:02.366 --> 45:05.779
Man,
I think we should put our ankles in it.

46:25.533 --> 46:27.865
They broke into my home.

46:28.035 --> 46:30.526
They got the ledger.

46:30.705 --> 46:32.696
They got the manifest,
they got everything.

46:32.873 --> 46:34.829
Everything.
Names, dates, schedules.

46:35.001 --> 46:36.457
We even got the shipping routes.

46:36.627 --> 46:38.333
They won´t be able to take a shit...

46:38.504 --> 46:40.369
...without us knowing
when or what color.

46:40.548 --> 46:43.210
We cleaned up the streets
and gave them back to the people.

46:43.384 --> 46:47.423
Once again, making them a pleasant
place to take an afternoon stroll.

46:52.101 --> 46:54.558
Extra, extra. Hot off the presses.

46:54.729 --> 46:57.220
Black Dynamite
cleans up the street.

46:58.524 --> 47:00.731
lt´s unbelievable, Black Dynamite.

47:00.901 --> 47:02.892
Everyne looks so happy...

47:03.070 --> 47:04.651
...and it´s all thanks to you.

47:04.822 --> 47:06.983
l´d like to take the credit
but dig, Mama.

47:07.158 --> 47:10.241
There´s no " l "  in revolutin'   team .

47:10.953 --> 47:13.740
Look, l know l´m gonna be rusty,
but I have to try.

47:15.416 --> 47:17.498
Hi, girls. What is your name?

47:17.668 --> 47:19.750
l´m Shawanda,
and her name's Brikwela.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.126
Those are beautiful names.

47:21.297 --> 47:24.084
I´m GIoria
and this is Black Dynamite.

47:24.258 --> 47:27.091
My mama said
my daddy´s name is Black Dynamite.

47:27.845 --> 47:29.426
So did my mama.

47:30.765 --> 47:32.676
Hush up, little girls.

47:32.850 --> 47:35.136
A lot of cats have that name.

48:17.561 --> 48:21.429
Well, that was amazing.

48:21.649 --> 48:24.482
Thank you
for a beautiful day and night.

48:26.487 --> 48:31.481
But l think I should be going.

48:31.659 --> 48:34.742
I think you´ll be safer
if you stay here tonight.

48:35.788 --> 48:37.699
Oh, you do, do you?

48:38.124 --> 48:40.831
l hope you don´t think you´re
gonna get any of this cookie.

48:41.001 --> 48:43.162
Because if l offered you
some of this cookie...

48:43.337 --> 48:44.827
...this cookie might kill you.

48:45.172 --> 48:47.754
Don´t think because
we´ve been frolicking in the park...

48:47.925 --> 48:49.790
...you got this closed
because it takes...

48:49.969 --> 48:51.334
Yeah, yeah, Mama.

48:52.513 --> 48:55.721
You can hit the sheets or the streets.
lt don´t make me no never mind.

48:55.891 --> 48:58.177
That´s your bag, baby.
You can go or you can come.

48:58.352 --> 48:59.637
Can you dig it?

50:13.928 --> 50:14.917
Yeah.

50:15.095 --> 50:16.130
Black Dynamlte.

50:16.305 --> 50:18.216
We read the ledger
and it just don´t stop.

50:18.390 --> 50:22.383
There´s a trail of paper
that leads all the way to the top.

50:22.561 --> 50:24.176
A big shipment is coming to town...

50:24.355 --> 50:26.971
...and it´s right there
where that cracker wrote it down.

50:27.149 --> 50:29.731
Now, we don´t know the whens,
but we do know the wheres.

50:29.902 --> 50:33.611
And however the fuck the whats,
we´ll sure enough be there.

50:37.243 --> 50:39.484
Looks like he´s got two warehouses.

50:39.662 --> 50:42.995
One big one,
and one smaller one here.

50:43.165 --> 50:46.783
We break into the two units,
we hit the smaller one first...

50:46.961 --> 50:49.418
...then we scale the fence,
enter from the south...

50:49.588 --> 50:52.955
...use an acetylene blowtorch to
breech the warehouse from the back.

50:53.133 --> 50:54.964
That way we avoid the guards.

50:55.135 --> 50:58.502
Man, them honkies gonna be running
for cover when us brothers get...

50:59.014 --> 51:01.096
Get... Get...

51:05.729 --> 51:06.764
The torch is an issue.

51:06.939 --> 51:09.305
We won´t be able to get
an acetylene torch in time.

51:09.483 --> 51:11.269
Think again, brother.

51:11.443 --> 51:13.650
You know somebody that´s got one?

51:14.154 --> 51:16.270
l know just the cat.

52:14.381 --> 52:16.713
All right, Snowflake.
Where's the dope?

52:16.884 --> 52:18.920
Up yours, coon.

52:20.721 --> 52:23.258
lt´s right over there
in the body bag, jeez.

52:29.813 --> 52:31.804
So how much dope
is in the big warehouse?

52:33.067 --> 52:37.811
They´re gonna kill me anyway.
I´m not gonna tell you nothing, coon.

52:39.573 --> 52:42.736
Dynamite, l got something
that will make him talk.

52:47.581 --> 52:50.698
l ain´t gonna tell you nothing.

52:51.335 --> 52:54.418
Operation Code Kansas.
Can´t stop it, too late.

52:54.588 --> 52:57.955
Operation Code Kansas

53:00.844 --> 53:04.428
Yeah, you won´t be so big
and so bad anymore...

53:04.598 --> 53:07.806
...because Kansas gonna fix you.

53:08.602 --> 53:10.467
Just the niggas.

53:10.646 --> 53:13.183
Just the nig...

53:18.278 --> 53:19.768
Damn, Smoke.

53:19.947 --> 53:21.983
l think you gave him
too much of that shit.

53:22.825 --> 53:25.032
How long till it wears off?

53:38.632 --> 53:39.712
It´s malt liquor?

53:40.634 --> 53:43.797
lt´s that new Anaconda Malt Liquor
from the billboards.

53:43.971 --> 53:46.007
lt´s supposed to give you...

53:51.812 --> 53:52.972
Tastes good too.

53:53.147 --> 53:54.762
l know the drugs
are here somewhere.

53:54.940 --> 53:57.932
We´re gonna check every crate
until we find it.

54:03.657 --> 54:05.272
I can´t believe it, fellas.

54:05.451 --> 54:08.614
That entire shipment
was just malt liquor.

54:08.787 --> 54:10.323
Don´t beat yourself up, Dynamite.

54:10.497 --> 54:13.284
We still kept the 50 keys
we found in that first warehouse...

54:13.459 --> 54:14.949
...from getting on the streets.

54:15.419 --> 54:17.705
l´m gonna go home
and drink the rest of this, man.

54:17.880 --> 54:20.997
Y´all should´we grabbed some
of this shit. This shit is incredible.

54:25.929 --> 54:28.511
l tell you, brothers,
it just don´t make no damn sense.

54:28.682 --> 54:31.515
The manifest, the shipping log,
the ledgers.

54:31.685 --> 54:34.518
All records are consistent
with that damned beer shipment.

54:34.688 --> 54:38.021
If anyting else was in there,
it would have to weigh someting.

54:38.192 --> 54:40.433
They got it out before we got there.

54:40.611 --> 54:41.691
No.

54:41.862 --> 54:44.854
Why would they have guards there
if they got the drug out?

54:45.032 --> 54:47.193
No, them crackers
was protecting something.

54:47.367 --> 54:50.951
B.D., we checked every single crate,
every stinking bottle.

54:51.121 --> 54:53.032
Man, l´m with you, Dynamite.

54:53.207 --> 54:55.368
That babbling cracker
knew someting.

54:55.542 --> 54:58.830
What that guard said,
I keep running through my head.

54:59.129 --> 55:00.994
Code Kansas.

55:01.173 --> 55:03.585
" You people
won´t be so big anymore.''

55:03.759 --> 55:05.545
Code Kansas.

55:05.719 --> 55:07.550
lt just don´t make no damn sense.

55:07.721 --> 55:09.052
Hey, sweet thing.

55:09.223 --> 55:12.215
What don´t make no sense is
the service around this motherfucker.

55:12.392 --> 55:13.882
Bitch, do you see us?

55:15.145 --> 55:17.431
l´d like two sausage links,
two sausage pattie...

55:17.606 --> 55:20.143
...two hot dogs,

55:20.317 --> 55:21.853
Baloney, fry that up into a dome.

55:22.027 --> 55:24.734
Slice that,
take a spatula, smush fry it.

55:24.905 --> 55:26.236
And one waffle, please.

55:26.406 --> 55:27.737
I can get your waffle...

55:27.908 --> 55:30.149
...but all we got
is the chicken from last night.

55:30.327 --> 55:33.114
Now, I can bring you some of that
if you want some meat.

55:34.248 --> 55:35.954
Chicken and waffles?

55:36.124 --> 55:37.614
That´s it.

55:39.419 --> 55:42.252
Take it easy, brother.
lt ain´t her fault.

55:42.464 --> 55:44.455
Sorry, sister,
we all just a little uptight.

55:44.633 --> 55:47.045
But if you bring us
some of them good-ass waffles...

55:47.219 --> 55:49.255
...everything will be all right.

55:50.305 --> 55:52.762
Man, you guys
ain´t had no waffles like these.

55:52.933 --> 55:54.924
These waffles are so god...

55:55.102 --> 55:57.184
...they´re like they come
from down South.

55:57.354 --> 55:59.766
These buttery motherfuckers
will melt in your mouth.

55:59.940 --> 56:02.773
-Man, you ain´t had no waffles...
-Wait.

56:03.861 --> 56:06.398
Bullhorn, what did you just say?

56:06.947 --> 56:08.733
You said:

56:08.907 --> 56:11.649
" Melts in your mouth. "

56:13.412 --> 56:14.902
Quick.

56:15.289 --> 56:17.450
What else melts in your mouth?

56:17.624 --> 56:20.491
-M&M´s.
-Exactly.

56:20.669 --> 56:23.285
And not in your hands.

56:24.298 --> 56:26.584
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

56:27.050 --> 56:28.130
And who makes M&M´s?

56:28.802 --> 56:30.508
Mars Candy Company makes it.

56:30.679 --> 56:32.044
-Yeah, yeah.
-That´s right.

56:32.222 --> 56:34.964
And Mars is also...

56:35.142 --> 56:38.976
-The Roman god of war.
-That´s what l´m telling you.

56:39.146 --> 56:41.762
Who is the Greek god of war?

56:41.940 --> 56:43.555
-Ares.
-Right on.

56:43.734 --> 56:48.694
Now, you take Mars
and spell it backward, drop the S.

56:48.864 --> 56:50.604
-What is it? What did you get?
" R "

56:50.782 --> 56:52.147
Ram. That´s right.

56:52.326 --> 56:56.660
And ram is the zodialogical sign
for Aries.

56:57.247 --> 56:58.327
-Now dig.
-That right.

56:58.498 --> 57:02.161
-Ares´s half sister is Athena.
-Now you´re getting it.

57:02.336 --> 57:05.078
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Athena, Atens.

57:05.255 --> 57:08.167
Which is the capital of Greece.

57:08.342 --> 57:09.627
And as we all know...

57:09.801 --> 57:13.089
...zodialogical astronomy
was created by the Greek in...

57:13.263 --> 57:15.629
785 B.C.

57:15.807 --> 57:19.345
And 785 is the area code of Topeka.
Oh, my God.

57:19.519 --> 57:23.603
785 is the area code
to Topeka, Kansas.

57:23.774 --> 57:25.856
Code Kansas.

57:26.026 --> 57:29.610
Now you take that,
spell it backwards and drop the S.

57:29.905 --> 57:32.692
Snake doc. Snake doctor, yeah.

57:33.075 --> 57:34.315
-Yes.
-Yeah.

57:34.493 --> 57:35.573
And brothers...

57:35.744 --> 57:38.781
...who is the Greek demigod
of medicine...

57:38.956 --> 57:42.414
...who believed that snakes´ tongues
had mystical healing power?

57:42.584 --> 57:44.575
Aesculapius, of course.

57:44.753 --> 57:48.792
He had a staff with snakes
intertwining all arund that bitch.

57:48.966 --> 57:50.957
They called it Aesculapius´s staff.

57:51.134 --> 57:53.841
It´s a symbol the medical field uses
to this day.

57:54.012 --> 57:55.047
l´ve seen it.

57:55.222 --> 57:58.931
Now,
what legend involving snakes...

57:59.101 --> 58:02.138
... is in both Greek and Roman
mythology?

58:02.312 --> 58:05.679
Now, come on.
It involves Aesculapius´ own father.

58:05.857 --> 58:07.267
Apollo.

58:08.485 --> 58:09.770
Yeah. Thanks, lady.

58:09.945 --> 58:10.980
That´s right.

58:11.154 --> 58:17.491
Apollo slew the serpent at Delphi
which was a big-ass snake.

58:17.661 --> 58:18.696
That´s right.

58:18.870 --> 58:22.078
And what, brothers,
is the biggest snake in the world?

58:22.249 --> 58:25.082
The South American anaconda.

58:25.252 --> 58:29.586
-What she said.
-Anaconda Malt Liquor.

58:29.756 --> 58:33.419
And what is the slogan
for Anaconda Malt Liquor?

58:33.593 --> 58:35.333
" Anaconda Malt Liquor gives you..."

58:36.430 --> 58:37.465
Gives you what?

58:38.640 --> 58:40.676
And who else is famous for:

58:41.226 --> 58:42.432
Little Richard.

58:42.602 --> 58:44.138
-Who?
-Little Richard.

58:44.312 --> 58:47.224
So, what they´re really saying is...

58:47.399 --> 58:51.608
Anaconda Malt Liquor
gives you Little Richard.

58:53.238 --> 58:56.071
What is anoter word for Richard?

58:59.286 --> 59:01.902
-Gunsmoke. Come on, get up.

59:17.888 --> 59:19.753
Should we kill him?

59:21.933 --> 59:23.889
Man, do you want to live?

59:25.312 --> 59:27.473
I said, do you want to go on?

59:37.032 --> 59:41.321
Man, this time these crackers
have gone too far.

59:42.829 --> 59:45.161
-The warehouse.
-The warehouse.

59:48.668 --> 59:50.829
Freeze, you jive-time suckers.

59:51.546 --> 59:53.502
Who´s in charge?

59:54.633 --> 59:57.545
Brothers, make these honkies load
this dick-shrinking poison...

59:57.719 --> 01:00:00.756
...back into the warehouse
so we can burn this mother down.

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.842
Waste them if they make a sound.

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:05.632
I´m gonna go inside and find out
who´s running this shit.

01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:09.850
-Allright, men, move it.
-Come on, you heard him.

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:11.729
Sucker, you drop it right there.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.936
-O'Leary?
-That´s right.

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:16.397
Go ahead, guys, I got this.

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:21.240
O'Leary, you son of a bitch.
l should have known it was you.

01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:22.444
You should have.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:25.326
You were too busy
and trying to lay that orphan mama...

01:00:25.497 --> 01:00:27.533
...to not see
what was in front of your face.

01:00:27.707 --> 01:00:30.540
You diabolical
dick-shrinking motherfuckers.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.246
You were the leak all the time.

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:34.456
And I bet you were behind
Jimmy´s death.

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:36.371
Hey, man,
I was just following orders.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:39.257
That´s what a good soldier does,
follow orders, unlike you.

01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:41.713
Everything´s gotta be done
the Black Dynamite way.

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:43.048
l gave the order on Jimmy.

01:00:43.223 --> 01:00:45.214
l gave it to James,
who gave it to the Don.

01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:47.553
What good´s it gonna do you now?

01:00:56.903 --> 01:01:00.066
The old birthday-candle trick
from Nam.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.822
Just when you think it´s out....

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:08.403
O'Leary. O'Leary, where are you?

01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:10.322
Yeah, who´s this?

01:01:35.066 --> 01:01:41.562
Fellas, we going on a boat ride
to Kung Fu Island.

01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:50.616
Hey, Black Dynamite,
there´s the island.

01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:02.999
Okay.

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:05.635
Now, here´s the plan.

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:12.471
Yeah.

01:02:13.939 --> 01:02:15.349
Okay, let´s split up.

01:02:36.336 --> 01:02:38.622
He´s here.

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:43.669
We kicked their ass.

01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:46.004
Power to the people, brothers.

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:48.503
This is it, brothers.

01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:52.345
-This is where we stick it to the Man.
-Yeah.

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:53.929
Now, let´s go get that lab.

01:02:56.064 --> 01:02:57.520
All right, let´s go.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:03.818
You know, when we get back home,
I´m gonna retire from the revolution.

01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:05.274
Start a famiIy.

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:06.858
Show this picture.

01:03:07.033 --> 01:03:08.193
That´s Betty Jo.

01:03:08.368 --> 01:03:10.484
Yeah, right on, yeah.

01:03:10.662 --> 01:03:13.529
Buy a home in the country.
Raise our own fruit and vegetables.

01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:15.413
Bake ur own bread,
know what l mean?

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:16.914
Bake our own...

01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:22.203
Who saw that coming...?
Who saw where that came from?

01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:24.839
Let´s go.

01:03:53.705 --> 01:03:56.913
l should´ve known you would be
behind this, fiendish Dr. Wu.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:01.080
Your knowledge of scientific
biological transmogrifications...

01:04:01.254 --> 01:04:04.587
... is only out-matched by your zest
for Kung Fu treachery.

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:12.255
Your Kung Fu is quite extraordinary,
Black Dynamite.

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:13.922
But no match for mine.

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:18.473
You should have joined us
when you had the chance.

01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:21.262
But now you must die.

01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:24.524
Man, l´ll take this jive-ass turkey.

01:04:24.986 --> 01:04:26.317
Bullhorn, no.

01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:31.447
Bullhorn, no.

01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:35.702
At long last, our friendship bonded
by the struggle against the Man...

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:39.239
...has been brought to an end
by Kung Fu treachery.

01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:43.410
Brother, your death
will not go unavenged.

01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:47.797
Fiendish Dr. Wu,
you done fucked up now.

01:04:48.843 --> 01:04:50.708
Get him.

01:05:07.779 --> 01:05:12.819
You must try the Wu family
Red Silk Kung Fu.

01:05:23.211 --> 01:05:25.327
Black Dynamite Panther fist.

01:06:26.399 --> 01:06:28.560
What the fuck, huh?

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:30.396
Keep your eye on Black Dynamite.

01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:41.782
Looking for me?

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:50.916
Can you see where I´m coming from,
you jive moterfucker?

01:06:53.384 --> 01:06:56.091
No rush, huh? Come on, huh?

01:06:57.889 --> 01:06:59.925
You told him
to keep an eye out for me.

01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:13.188
l threw that shit
before l walked in the room.

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:23.660
l wanna know
who´s  pulling your string.

01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:26.117
Now start talking. Talk.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:30.293
-l said, start talking.
-Okay.

01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:32.579
Your government
has been preoccupied...

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:34.998
...with building the bigger penis
for years.

01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:40.712
What´s this green one?

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:43.552
lt did exactly opposite
of what it was intended.

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:49.054
lt made the penis shrivel to the size
of a 2-month-old snapping turtIe.

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:51.644
This is what you´ve been putting
in the malt liquor?

01:07:51.818 --> 01:07:54.059
l was under orders.

01:07:54.779 --> 01:07:56.394
They threatened to fire me.

01:07:57.156 --> 01:07:59.067
Speaking of fire.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:03.902
Suddenly,
l´d like to leave your island.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.991
No! No!

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:07.530
No.

01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:20.171
You dirty motherfucker.

01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:28.343
Hey, Black Dynamite,
I found a helicopter.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.011
Quick, give me a hairpin!

01:08:43.493 --> 01:08:45.359
What´s in the briefcase,
Black Dynamite?

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:46.903
How far does this all go, man?

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:49.367
Cream Corn,
this goes all the way to the top.

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:53.535
And when l say top,
I mean the tippety-top.

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:56.671
There it is, Black Dynamite.
The Honky House.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:58.538
l´m going down.

01:08:58.926 --> 01:09:00.712
-This shouldn´t take long.
-Whoa, hey...

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:03.299
-Take the controls.
-What are you talking about?

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:06.256
Whoa, hey, hey, man.

01:09:09.103 --> 01:09:10.764
Son of a bitch.

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:18.734
Cream Corn, no!

01:10:40.194 --> 01:10:42.685
l should have known it was you
all the time.

01:10:42.864 --> 01:10:47.107
l should have asked myself,
'' Who´s the man so wicked...

01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:50.277
...so cruel to serve smack
to the orphanage...

01:10:50.455 --> 01:10:55.324
...kill my brother Jimmy, and put out
a drug to shrink black mens´ dicks?''

01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:59.999
Only one man,
and that´s you, Tricky Dick.

01:11:05.386 --> 01:11:09.345
So I´m here to deliver you one
presidential ass-whooping.

01:11:11.058 --> 01:11:12.923
Black Dynamite.

01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:15.847
There´s a perfectly...

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:20.899
...reasonabIe explanation for that.

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:28.864
Showtime, motherfucker.

01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:31.026
Fucking....

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:34.532
Black Dynamite.

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:36.868
Who the fuck would duck...?

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:41.043
Piece of shit.

01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:07.736
Don´t fuck with me.

01:12:08.241 --> 01:12:10.402
Motherfucker.

01:12:34.267 --> 01:12:37.634
Take your filthy black hands
off the presidential dinnerware...

01:12:37.812 --> 01:12:39.427
...you moon cricket.

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:45.709
And now, Black Dynamite,
you must die.

01:13:58.643 --> 01:14:00.429
You had enough, Mr. President?

01:14:01.562 --> 01:14:04.053
You´ll never get away with this.

01:14:04.231 --> 01:14:06.222
Watch me,
you little insecure cracker.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.186
You think
by shrinking our johnsons...

01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:10.397
...it´s gonna make your situation
any better?

01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:13.904
That´s your problem, Tricky Dick.
You are paranoid.

01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:16.441
Like sending those two-bit crooks
to Watergate.

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:18.234
For what?

01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:20.577
For these?

01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:23.530
-Look at you.
-What?

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:25.700
You lost it all, turkey.

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:30.454
-Killl me.
-Say what?

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:32.999
-Killl me.
-No.

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:34.667
That´s the easy way out for you.

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:37.712
Unless you want the rest
of this freaky shit to hit the news...

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:40.131
...l suggest you take care
of me and my people.

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:41.344
Can you dig it?

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:44.218
I said, can you dig it?

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:45.762
Yes, l can dig it.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:48.022
Thought you could.

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:21.593
First Lady, l´m sorry l pimp-slapped
you into that china cabinet.

01:15:21.767 --> 01:15:24.179
I used excessive force.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:26.435
Oftentimes, I cross the line...

01:15:26.605 --> 01:15:29.438
...but l try to do so
in the name of what's right.

01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:32.520
Most of the time,
the ends justifies the means.

01:15:32.695 --> 01:15:36.984
But in this case, I fee like I betrayed
my own code of ethics...

01:15:37.158 --> 01:15:40.025
...and for that, sugar, I apologize.

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:42.444
But l shot at you.

01:15:42.621 --> 01:15:44.953
l tried to kill you, Black Dynamite.

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:48.495
This is true,
but you did not connect.

01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:49.954
You shot a plate.

01:15:50.129 --> 01:15:53.041
Had you connected.
maybe pimp-slapping you into that...

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:55.046
...might have been justified.

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:57.333
But I feel I crossed the line.

01:15:57.511 --> 01:16:00.298
And for that,
please accept my apology.

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:02.137
l do.

01:16:02.308 --> 01:16:03.764
l do, it´s just...

01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:07.472
Oh, BIack Dynamite,
you´re so righteous.

01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:09.853
This is also true.

01:16:10.024 --> 01:16:11.810
Because
whenever there´s  injustice...

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:13.815
...wrongs to be...

01:16:13.986 --> 01:16:16.352
Oh, Black Dynamite.

01:16:19.033 --> 01:16:20.569
Go on, honey.

01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:25.657
Because wherever there´s injustice,
wrongs to be righted...

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:28.994
...innocents to be defended,
Black Dynamite will be there...

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:31.500
...delivering ass-whoopings.

01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:34.662
And l will not hesitate to lay
the hammer down on any clown...

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.171
...that comes around.

01:16:36.342 --> 01:16:40.176
Because if they wanna fight,
they best come see me...

01:16:40.346 --> 01:16:42.962
...because l´m Black Dynamite.

01:19:43.862 --> 01:19:46.148
How you doing
with that midget girl you sent out?

01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:48.860
Man, she keeps coming up short.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.956
And better no nigga
mess with me, neither.

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:08.797
l would jump on him,
all 93 pound of dynamite.

01:20:08.971 --> 01:20:10.802
That´s right.

01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:27.778
So I says, '' Bitch, you look like
you need a pimp in your life.''

01:20:27.948 --> 01:20:29.609
She said, ''I got a pimp.''

01:20:29.783 --> 01:20:32.490
l said,
''Shit, that nigga ain't no pimp.

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:35.027
He´s a valet for ho's.''

01:20:44.465 --> 01:20:46.376
It´s called the
Mo Bitches Variety Pack.

01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:47.585
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:51.469
l send out a big ho. a little ho,
a skinny ho, and one Navajo.

01:20:51.764 --> 01:20:54.380
-Is that right?
-That's right.

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:22.453
Take that, you cracker-ass cracker.

01:21:22.628 --> 01:21:26.291
All right, girls, let´s take them down.

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:51.277
l only do two things well
in this world.

01:21:51.448 --> 01:21:56.988
I take money from bitches
and l sell drugs to the community.

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.511
l had to send your ho back
the other day.

01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:17.922
-No?
-Yeah, man.

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:21.809
She reckless eyeballing
and carrying on.

01:22:21.979 --> 01:22:26.063
She fine, but I said,
''Hey, your man is bona fide.''

01:22:26.233 --> 01:22:28.349
See? You're a righteous pimp.

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:30.813
Shit, the real pimping lives here.

01:22:30.988 --> 01:22:32.228
lt ain´t ego.

01:22:32.406 --> 01:22:34.897
That's how we go. You like that?

01:23:00.601 --> 01:23:03.559
You gotta cross the lines sometimes.

01:23:04.563 --> 01:23:09.102
Sometimes to do the right thing,
you got to do the ugly thing.

01:23:11.403 --> 01:23:14.816
You know people, they don´t want
to see the cow killed...

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:16.855
...they just want their steak
on a plate.

01:23:17.034 --> 01:23:18.365
Can you dig it?

01:23:40.474 --> 01:23:42.430
Good evening, gentlemen.

01:23:43.977 --> 01:23:46.059
Who let that nigga in my house?

01:23:47.305 --> 01:23:53.390
