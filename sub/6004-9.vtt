PETER: According to
my Boom Box,

00:03.120 --> 00:04.460
the Cosmic Seed
should be just up ahead.

00:04.490 --> 00:06.190
ROCKET: How many
mud balls we gotta search

00:06.220 --> 00:08.080
to find the stinkin'
thing, Quill?

00:08.119 --> 00:09.350
I'll scour every last planet

00:09.390 --> 00:11.250
to keep it out of
the hands of Thanos.

00:13.400 --> 00:16.540
Agreed, Gamora.
And I, to exact my revenge.

00:16.570 --> 00:18.400
ROCKET: (SIGHS)
You know, it ain't healthy

00:18.430 --> 00:20.430
to hold onto the past
like that, Drax.

00:20.470 --> 00:22.210
Not true, Rocket.

00:22.240 --> 00:24.580
This image of my family
requires no effort to carry.

00:24.610 --> 00:28.450
But I would hold onto it,
if it weighed a thousand tons.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.380
What I mean, Mr. Literal,

00:30.410 --> 00:32.240
is I lost my family, too,

00:32.280 --> 00:34.340
but do I get all
teary-eyed about it?

00:34.380 --> 00:38.250
Nope. I said goodbye
and never looked back.

00:38.290 --> 00:41.260
'Cause there ain't no thing
like me, except me.

00:43.630 --> 00:45.460
Looks like we're too late.

00:45.490 --> 00:47.490
The entire valley's
been gutted.

00:51.430 --> 00:55.160
The box says this mineral
deposit is radiating
Cosmic Seed energy.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.400
It appears someone,
or something,

00:57.440 --> 00:59.340
has been excavating
the mineral.

00:59.380 --> 01:02.210
Which means it's got to be
worth something to somebody.

01:02.240 --> 01:04.239
Or, I can make it go boom.

01:04.280 --> 01:08.190
So, win-win.
Good news,
the Cosmic Seed was here.

01:08.220 --> 01:10.490
Bad news, the "was" part.

escaped from a lab where

12:29.900 --> 12:32.800
Too late for

takes the next step
in evolution.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.610
