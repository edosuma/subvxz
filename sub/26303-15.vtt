WEBVTT

00:04.352 --> 00:06.658
We've had a spate of
break-ins the past few weeks.

00:06.702 --> 00:08.138
Every robbery has taken place

00:08.182 --> 00:09.705
within five minutes
of Engine 66.

00:09.748 --> 00:11.924
Can you convince me that
there's a fire fighter

00:11.968 --> 00:13.491
behind all this?

00:13.535 --> 00:15.363
We want a friendly
firefighter inside 66

00:15.406 --> 00:17.974
to help us sniff out
the bad guy.

00:19.497 --> 00:22.065
- So you're recording me?
- What happened, Suggs?

00:24.024 --> 00:27.375
Gimme the phone now, Cruz!

00:27.418 --> 00:29.029
Gimme the phone!
What are you gonna do,

00:29.072 --> 00:31.007
You gonna take it away from me?
Give me the phone!

00:31.031 --> 00:33.120
Hey! Whoa!
What are you doing, Suggs?

00:33.163 --> 00:35.315
What, you're just giving away
your key for burglaries, man?

00:35.339 --> 00:37.187
- For what, for cash?
- No, no, it's not like that.

00:37.211 --> 00:39.051
Okay, all right,
then tell me what it's like.

00:39.082 --> 00:41.128
Explain it to me, please.

00:46.872 --> 00:48.744
I can still fix it.

00:48.787 --> 00:51.138
- Suggs, I...
- Please!

00:51.181 --> 00:53.183
I'll get the key back.

00:53.227 --> 00:54.706
Just give me some time.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.840
- Suggs, II...
- I'll make it right!

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:06.283 --> 01:08.155
Last person I would've expected.

01:08.198 --> 01:09.547
The guy's solid.

01:09.591 --> 01:11.462
He's clearly handing
his key off.

01:11.506 --> 01:13.073
He's probably not even
participating

01:13.116 --> 01:14.378
in the burglaries himself.

01:14.422 --> 01:16.095
There's got to be a reason
he's doing this.

01:16.119 --> 01:17.425
Key's still out there.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.427
I think Suggs is trying
to get it back.

01:19.470 --> 01:21.255
Cruz, did you get a plate
on this car?

01:21.298 --> 01:22.908
- No, sorry.
- All right.

01:22.952 --> 01:24.388
I'll run make and model,

01:24.432 --> 01:26.434
have OEMC any calls
of suspicious activity

01:26.477 --> 01:27.715
in the zone
of the burglaries to us.

01:27.739 --> 01:29.567
We'll be in front
of the next one.

01:29.611 --> 01:31.411
All right, good,
get an emergency ping order

01:31.439 --> 01:33.136
on Suggs' phone...
Let's bring him in fast.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.920
You're arresting
a Chicago Firefighter

01:34.964 --> 01:37.706
for using CFD property
in a string of burglaries.

01:37.749 --> 01:40.404
Yes, and I'd like to have
that firefighter in cuffs

01:40.448 --> 01:42.319
before news travels through
your department.

01:42.363 --> 01:43.929
I spent time with Suggs

01:43.973 --> 01:45.820
and he's not some hardened
criminal, he's a good guy.

01:45.844 --> 01:48.238
He justhe seemed in
over his head.

01:48.282 --> 01:49.718
All right, Joe, I hear you.

01:49.761 --> 01:52.373
Listen, as soon as we have him,
I'll talk to him.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.331
Appreciate it, Joe.

01:57.378 --> 01:59.728
Good to have you back, Cruz.

01:59.771 --> 02:01.382
Yeah, yeah.

02:02.644 --> 02:05.125
Nothing I said
is gonna matter, is it?

02:13.220 --> 02:15.222
Okay, roll there with Burgess,
send me the ping,

02:15.265 --> 02:17.267
and I'll meet you guys there.
Hey, Jay!

02:17.311 --> 02:19.574
Hold up! I'm coming with you.

02:19.617 --> 02:21.663
- No, we got it, man.
- No, no, hey, hey, listen.

02:21.706 --> 02:24.709
You have a suspect
because of me.

02:24.753 --> 02:26.537
II got to talk to him.

02:26.581 --> 02:28.800
That's it,
II just got to be there.

02:28.844 --> 02:31.194
- Joe, you know I can't.
- Please, Jay.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.544
He's one of ours.

02:34.980 --> 02:38.593
All right, listen to me, you
stay where I tell you to stay.

02:44.251 --> 02:45.817
What you got?

02:45.861 --> 02:47.819
It's over there somewhere.

02:55.262 --> 02:56.828
Hey, Cruz.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.222
Is this the place?

02:59.266 --> 03:02.312
Yeah, um,
four consecutive pings,

03:02.356 --> 03:03.811
but he hasn't moved
in the last half hour,

03:03.835 --> 03:05.378
so he's got to be around
here somewhere.

03:05.402 --> 03:07.578
- Maybe he ditched his phone.
- Yeah.

03:07.622 --> 03:09.189
All right,
let's fan out and search.

03:09.232 --> 03:10.514
Cruz, you gotta stay
with the truck.

03:10.538 --> 03:11.800
No, no, I can help!

03:11.843 --> 03:14.194
Trust me, man,
just stay here. Okay?

03:37.217 --> 03:39.001
Hailey, Jay!

03:43.353 --> 03:45.660
It's Suggs' car.

03:45.703 --> 03:48.010
Chicago PD!
Anyone inside the vehicle?

03:48.053 --> 03:51.143
Yeah, he's in there.
Let me see your hands!

03:59.413 --> 04:01.458
I don't see a gun,

04:01.502 --> 04:03.721
but I smell the gunpowder.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.419
5021 George.

04:05.462 --> 04:07.262
Squad, roll the crime lab
to 1900 South Canal.

04:07.290 --> 04:10.337
I got a bonafide DOA,
GSWs to the head and the chest.

04:10.380 --> 04:11.773
Offender may still be
in the area.

04:11.816 --> 04:14.254
- Suggs, Suggs!
- Hold on, hold on.

04:14.297 --> 04:15.796
Joe, wait a second! Hold on!
You can't go in there.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.474
Come on, man! I can help him!

04:17.517 --> 04:19.214
No, you can't touch him
or the car.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.887
You're going to contaminate it.
It's a crime scene.

04:20.911 --> 04:24.612
- Please, I...
- Joe, he's gone.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.178
I'm sorry.

04:31.183 --> 04:33.273
Two 9mm, both contact wounds.

04:33.316 --> 04:34.622
The thing happened fast.

04:34.665 --> 04:36.232
There's no sign of struggle
in the car.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.428
You're thinking he let the
offender in the car with him?

04:38.452 --> 04:40.584
Yeah, I think he knew him.
Let'slet's say the guy

04:40.628 --> 04:42.934
parks in the alley, walked
downstairs to meet Suggs,

04:42.978 --> 04:44.719
shot him as soon
as he got in the car.

04:44.762 --> 04:47.939
Boss, there's no cameras,
no PODs outside or in.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.941
So they were
very much alone down here.

04:49.985 --> 04:51.595
All right, cell phone
or lockbox key?

04:51.639 --> 04:53.249
Doesn't look like the key's
here.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.618
The phone's on its way
to OCD tech.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.228
Okay, patrol searched
the whole perimeter,

04:56.252 --> 04:58.143
they got nothing, now they're
doing walk and talks

04:58.167 --> 05:00.735
a couple of blocks away,
but the streets are dead.

05:00.778 --> 05:03.172
It's a good place for a kill.

05:04.173 --> 05:07.089
Antonio,
I want you take over the scene.

05:07.132 --> 05:09.831
Rest of us, we're gonna start
digging into Suggs.

05:09.874 --> 05:12.573
Interview his family,
firefighters at 66,

05:12.616 --> 05:14.139
who was he working with?

05:14.183 --> 05:18.622
Listen, firefighter brotherhood
is just as strong as ours.

05:18.666 --> 05:20.450
The fact that
we're investigating him,

05:20.494 --> 05:22.626
it is gonna move fast through
Chicago Fire,

05:22.670 --> 05:24.802
and it's not sit well.

05:24.846 --> 05:26.804
Let's get these statements
before it does.

05:26.848 --> 05:28.458
Copy that.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.507
Cruz.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.250
What are you doing here?

05:38.294 --> 05:39.619
We're here to talk to Suggs'
wife,

05:39.643 --> 05:40.963
we got a couple questions
for her.

05:40.992 --> 05:42.994
That's...

05:43.038 --> 05:44.996
She's over here.

05:47.216 --> 05:49.436
CPD's chaplain detail just left.

05:49.479 --> 05:51.307
Thank you for sending them.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.917
Of course.

05:52.961 --> 05:55.180
66 Lieutenant's offered
to take her home,

05:55.224 --> 05:58.923
but don't think she wants
to bring the kids back

05:58.967 --> 06:00.621
to the house yet.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.274
She's right through there.

06:02.318 --> 06:04.538
- Okay, thank you.
- Yeah.

06:07.149 --> 06:12.372
No, I don't know where
my husband was going or...

06:12.415 --> 06:15.679
who he was meeting,
but his shift was over at 800.

06:15.723 --> 06:18.247
He should've come home.

06:19.248 --> 06:21.729
Does he usually
come directly home after work?

06:21.772 --> 06:23.861
He likes to be there

06:23.905 --> 06:26.386
for the kids to go to school.

06:29.084 --> 06:31.478
Had you noticed him spending
more time with anyone

06:31.521 --> 06:33.218
in the last couple of weeks?

06:33.262 --> 06:34.829
No.

06:34.872 --> 06:37.048
Has he had any reason
to be stressed?

06:37.092 --> 06:41.705
Right? Friend or problems
at work, issues with money?

06:41.749 --> 06:43.011
Money?

06:45.448 --> 06:47.537
Why are you asking me that?

06:47.581 --> 06:49.381
We're just trying
to find out what happened,

06:49.409 --> 06:52.281
so I'm sorry
if the question seems random.

06:52.324 --> 06:57.286
I don't believe any of what
you're asking me is random.

06:57.329 --> 06:59.549
Why would you ask me
about money?

06:59.593 --> 07:02.247
We have reason to believe
that your husband's murder

07:02.291 --> 07:05.163
may have been related to
a string of burglaries.

07:05.207 --> 07:06.382
No.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.620
So if we can get
as many details...

07:07.644 --> 07:08.839
No, my husband was a good man.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.517
We're not implying
that he wasn't.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.561
- Get out.
- Mrs. Suggs...

07:11.605 --> 07:12.823
Get out! I want you out!

07:12.867 --> 07:14.912
I want you to get out right now!

07:14.956 --> 07:16.697
What's going on?
Are you all right?

07:16.740 --> 07:18.544
I'm not gonna sit here
while they accuse my husband!

07:18.568 --> 07:19.917
- I'm tired...
- Okay, come on!

07:19.961 --> 07:21.441
I can't deal
with this right now.

07:21.484 --> 07:23.443
Get out!
Let's just step aside, Kiara.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.575
Let's just take a deep breath.
You're okay.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.011
I think it's time you go.

07:27.055 --> 07:30.101
We're just trying
to do our job, Joe.

07:35.150 --> 07:37.108
Well, there never was gonna be

07:37.152 --> 07:39.023
a good version of that
conversation.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.808
She had no idea
who he was meeting with?

07:40.851 --> 07:42.331
No, no, it didn't seem like

07:42.374 --> 07:44.202
she knew anything about
the burglaries either.

07:44.246 --> 07:46.291
All right, where we at
with the crime scene?

07:46.335 --> 07:48.293
Little from forensics.

07:48.337 --> 07:49.773
9MMs don't pop in our system,

07:49.817 --> 07:53.081
but OCD Tech ran his cell,
confirms our theory.

07:53.124 --> 07:54.212
Suggs sent two texts

07:54.256 --> 07:55.866
after he got off the phone
with Cruz.

07:55.910 --> 07:58.390
"This is no longer okay,"
"You have to meet me."

07:58.434 --> 08:00.392
Both were sent to a burner

08:00.436 --> 08:02.394
that called Suggs back
two minutes later.

08:02.438 --> 08:04.024
Okay, so we know Suggs was
born and raised

08:04.048 --> 08:06.529
in the housing project
Aldrich Gardens.

08:06.573 --> 08:07.965
He has one prior as a juvenile,

08:08.009 --> 08:09.849
he was a low-level runner
for the G Park Lords,

08:09.880 --> 08:12.230
but that's when he was 15.
He's been clean ever since

08:12.274 --> 08:14.624
and then he joins
the fire academy at 18.

08:14.668 --> 08:17.148
He made a good life
for himself too.

08:17.192 --> 08:18.778
I mean, he got
every commendation possible

08:18.802 --> 08:21.675
from Chicago Fire,
record number of saves for 66.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.633
The guy was a bonafide hero.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.983
Zero on financials.
No debt, no influx.

08:26.027 --> 08:28.551
The money from the burglaries
wasn't going into his account.

08:28.595 --> 08:31.075
The only oddity is he withdrew
$3,000 from his savings account

08:31.119 --> 08:33.337
and he put it back
in the next day.

08:33.381 --> 08:35.993
Why would a guy like this
get involved in burglary?

08:36.037 --> 08:37.559
I don't know.

08:37.604 --> 08:39.344
I'd start with means,
opportunity.

08:39.388 --> 08:40.476
Motive will follow.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.738
Hey, Hank.

08:41.782 --> 08:44.044
I sweet-talked Trudy.

08:47.396 --> 08:49.050
You got a second?

08:50.007 --> 08:53.968
Yeah. My officers
told me you over at 66.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.970
I know Commissioner Grissom.

08:56.013 --> 08:59.408
He asked me to swing by 66
and asked me to come here.

08:59.451 --> 09:01.845
Wanted to make sure that
Intelligence was investigating

09:01.889 --> 09:03.455
the whole of the man.

09:03.499 --> 09:06.415
That so? Why'd he ask you?

09:06.458 --> 09:08.417
Well, Suggs lived in my ward.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.506
And you...

09:10.550 --> 09:12.987
weren't so cooperative with CFD.

09:13.030 --> 09:16.381
So Grissom thought I would
have better luck as a friend.

09:16.425 --> 09:19.123
I didn't realize we were
that good friends, Ray.

09:19.167 --> 09:22.039
I think we're getting there.

09:24.128 --> 09:28.655
The CFD and myself
were hoping it was possible

09:28.698 --> 09:32.484
you clear Suggs' murder
while preserving his name.

09:32.528 --> 09:33.964
Look, Ray, I don't get to decide

09:34.008 --> 09:35.923
where my investigations go.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.881
It's a couple of burglaries.

09:37.925 --> 09:40.405
Now, if this man
is accused of a crime,

09:40.449 --> 09:41.889
his pension's at stake,
his family...

09:41.929 --> 09:43.800
Boss, sorry to interrupt.

09:43.844 --> 09:46.368
Dispatch got an alarm trip.

09:46.411 --> 09:47.717
It's, 860 South Wabash.

09:47.761 --> 09:49.371
That's the zone
of the burglaries.

09:49.414 --> 09:51.436
Patrol's already there.
Set it up then roll on it.

09:51.460 --> 09:52.896
You keep digging into Suggs.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.855
You got it. Yeah.

09:56.073 --> 09:58.119
Suggs' family doesn't deserve
to lose his pension.

09:58.162 --> 10:01.470
Ray, listen, I heard the ask.

10:01.513 --> 10:03.385
Really, believe me,

10:03.428 --> 10:05.735
last thing I want to do
is bury a good man,

10:05.779 --> 10:08.303
particularly a firefighter.

10:08.346 --> 10:10.653
I'm doing everything I can.

10:18.792 --> 10:22.186
Afternoon. We got a call that
the burglary alarm was tripped.

10:22.230 --> 10:23.840
Yeah,
the thing was just installed,

10:23.884 --> 10:25.775
been tripping all week.
You guys were already here.

10:25.799 --> 10:27.191
Patrol went up in the building?

10:27.235 --> 10:29.629
No, there was no need.
It's been silent all day.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.500
Silent or not,
we got to clear the place.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.894
All right,
it's your time to waste.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.765
The alarm tripped first floor
and penthouse.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.308
You wanna take one
and I'll take the penthouse?

10:37.332 --> 10:38.768
Yeah.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.815
5021 George, squad,
roll a couple cars

10:41.858 --> 10:43.793
to that alarm on Wabash,
help us clear the building.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.253
Advise whoever's responding

10:45.296 --> 10:48.299
we're on premise.
Copy that, 5021.

10:48.343 --> 10:50.127
Yo, Po-po!

10:51.346 --> 10:53.522
5021 George,
armed burglary in progress.

10:53.565 --> 10:56.177
Wearing dark clothing...

10:56.220 --> 10:58.222
Wearing dark clothing,
got white shoes on,

10:58.266 --> 11:00.355
he's got a black mask...
Son of a bitch.

11:00.398 --> 11:02.139
He just headed down
the elevator.

11:02.183 --> 11:04.707
Hailey, he's headed to you!
Copy that.

11:05.752 --> 11:08.189
Police!

11:09.103 --> 11:12.062
Squad, advise my partner, I got
eyes on the second offender.

11:12.106 --> 11:13.977
Copy 5021 George. Will notify.

11:14.021 --> 11:17.502
Put your hands up,
back away slow.

11:17.546 --> 11:19.156
I need you to back away!

11:19.200 --> 11:21.681
Wait, wait, wait! If I
back away, he's going to die!

11:29.993 --> 11:31.734
He won't, all right?

11:31.778 --> 11:33.214
I'll take over,

11:33.257 --> 11:37.827
but I need you to put
your hands up and back away!

11:37.871 --> 11:40.830
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.399
Get up against the wall,
nice and slow!

11:47.794 --> 11:49.534
Get on the damn ground!

11:49.578 --> 11:51.711
I'm sorry, we were
never supposed to hurt anybody!

11:51.754 --> 11:53.582
Hehehe got scared
and then he collapsed

11:53.625 --> 11:56.672
and he hit his head, okay?
I'm sorry.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.196
Kid, do not run.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.199
I'm sorry!

12:02.243 --> 12:05.246
Kid, kid!

12:06.813 --> 12:08.945
5021 George, advise my partner,

12:08.989 --> 12:10.555
second offender fleeing.

12:10.599 --> 12:12.732
I've got a man down,
cardiac arrest, roll an ambo.

12:12.775 --> 12:15.082
Upton, are you copying?

12:15.125 --> 12:17.214
Copy, Jay, are you okay?

12:18.172 --> 12:20.087
Yeah, I'm good. Be advised,

12:20.130 --> 12:21.871
second offender has a gun
in his waistband.

12:21.915 --> 12:24.308
Repeat, Hailey, he is armed.

12:24.352 --> 12:25.570
Copy.

12:32.795 --> 12:35.015
Damn it.

12:44.415 --> 12:47.244
5021 Henry, squad,
we need those backup cars.

12:47.288 --> 12:49.048
I've got two offenders in
the wind, one man down,

12:49.072 --> 12:51.335
I need a perimeter lock-up
on Wabash now.

12:55.035 --> 12:57.080
- Jay, we're coming in!
- All right.

12:57.124 --> 12:59.822
The apartment's not clear yet.

12:59.866 --> 13:02.564
- How long?
- Five minutes.

13:02.607 --> 13:03.889
Someone was administering
before me.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.436
I got reason to believe
he hit his head

13:05.480 --> 13:07.047
before he went into arrest.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.613
Okay.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.485
All right, I got you.
You got me?

13:10.528 --> 13:11.723
- Yep.
- The apartment's clear.

13:11.747 --> 13:12.748
Go.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.402
You good?

13:14.445 --> 13:16.491
- Yeah, you?
- Yeah.

13:16.534 --> 13:17.773
Both offenders are in the wind.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.581
Security guard said
he saw a green Camry

13:19.624 --> 13:22.062
flee the south entrance,
no plates.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.977
He's just a kid.

13:24.020 --> 13:26.240
It's crazy!

13:27.676 --> 13:28.676
Clear.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.723
Anything?

13:31.767 --> 13:34.335
We got a pulse. Let's move.

13:34.378 --> 13:36.095
Put a C-collar on him,
keep his head steady.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.164
Okay.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.776
You got a makeshift c-collar,
that's smart.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.344
Yeah, it was.
Wasn't me who made it.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.741
They stole a safe from
the back bedroom,

13:49.785 --> 13:51.961
no footage of them, cameras
haven't been set up yet.

13:52.005 --> 13:54.398
No witnesses, hardly anyone's
moved into the building.

13:54.442 --> 13:57.488
I have alerts out on both
the offenders and the car.

13:57.532 --> 13:58.881
Same car, same MO.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.554
These are the guys Suggs
was working with.

14:00.578 --> 14:01.797
They had his lockbox key.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.079
They used it
to open a box outside,

14:03.103 --> 14:04.943
which gave them access
to the service entrance.

14:04.974 --> 14:06.976
I don't think they thought
anyone was going to be

14:07.020 --> 14:08.586
in the apartment.

14:08.630 --> 14:10.458
Jay, how's the victim?

14:10.501 --> 14:12.677
Just got to Med.
He's critical but stable.

14:12.721 --> 14:15.289
This kid might have saved
his life, he administered CPR.

14:15.332 --> 14:16.943
He did it well.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.553
And you got a good look at him?

14:18.596 --> 14:19.815
I could ID him.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.556
All right,
we'll start with that.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.490
Get on the horn with graphics,
get a sketch going.

14:23.514 --> 14:25.516
All right.

14:27.214 --> 14:29.042
I got nothing.

14:29.085 --> 14:30.478
Not a single nexus so far.

14:30.521 --> 14:32.456
I've combed through
every family member Suggs had.

14:32.480 --> 14:36.832
Nephew, cousin, sibling, child.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.921
No one matching that age range.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.924
We're still thinking these
kids are our lead suspect

14:41.968 --> 14:43.491
in Suggs' murder?

14:43.534 --> 14:45.841
Well, we've seen killers
younger than 15.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.799
They are the ones
Suggs gave the key to.

14:47.843 --> 14:50.977
Yeah, but I caught these guys
in the middle of a burglary

14:51.020 --> 14:53.022
and they were panicked,
they were terrified.

14:53.066 --> 14:55.938
This one, he's armed,
never reached for his gun,

14:55.982 --> 14:57.505
and I don't even
he ever thought to.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.289
Well, adrenaline and fear.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.745
Leave a little for thought,
you know?

15:00.769 --> 15:02.205
Yeah but it does leave instinct,

15:02.249 --> 15:04.033
and his instinct was
to save a man's life.

15:04.077 --> 15:05.687
Hehe was doing CPR.

15:05.730 --> 15:08.429
Then he had to have
learned that somewhere.

15:08.472 --> 15:10.822
Okay, okay, okay,
the Chicago Fire Department,

15:10.866 --> 15:12.868
they have a program like
the Police Explorers

15:12.912 --> 15:14.522
for at risk youth.

15:14.565 --> 15:15.978
I bet you Suggs
was volunteering there.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.588
That is going to explain
their connection.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.744
Check it out.

15:21.877 --> 15:23.574
I asked Herrmann
to meet us here,

15:23.618 --> 15:25.402
I got a vibe
we could use a liaison.

15:25.446 --> 15:27.100
Yeah, it's not easy
investigating a guy

15:27.143 --> 15:28.884
everybody thinks is a saint.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.060
Hey, Jay, Kim!

15:31.104 --> 15:32.583
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:32.627 --> 15:35.282
Marty, Officer Burgess,
Detective Halstead.

15:35.325 --> 15:36.718
Marty Shaw.

15:36.761 --> 15:38.807
He runs the program here.

15:38.850 --> 15:41.766
Guy's in charge of
250 teenagers a year,

15:41.810 --> 15:44.552
and absolutely nobody
envies him that.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.095
Thanks for meeting with us.
Nice to meet you.

15:46.119 --> 15:48.948
I'm here because
Herrmann asked me to be.

15:48.991 --> 15:51.559
Of course, um, we understand
that you knew Suggs?

15:51.602 --> 15:55.563
Very well. He's volunteered
here for over a decade.

15:55.606 --> 15:58.087
This place was his heart.

15:58.131 --> 16:00.002
Was he close with
any of the kids here?

16:00.046 --> 16:04.093
Look, that's what I'm saying,
he was close with all of them.

16:05.529 --> 16:08.010
Do you recognize this kid?

16:13.494 --> 16:15.148
Marty.

16:16.279 --> 16:17.977
Yeah, I know him.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.417
Aiden West, 15 years old,
lives in Aldrich Gardens,

16:23.460 --> 16:24.984
same project
that Suggs grew up in.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.682
Doesn't have a ton of family,
lives with his great aunt.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.771
- He plugged in?
- I mean, it looks like loosely

16:29.814 --> 16:31.077
with the G Park Lords.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.035
He's got a couple
of gang cards filled out,

16:33.079 --> 16:35.907
got one prior, he got popped
slinging a nickel bad of weed.

16:35.951 --> 16:38.693
That's a huge graduation
to homicide, Sarge, but...

16:38.736 --> 16:40.149
yeah, this is the kid.
I'm sure of it.

16:40.173 --> 16:41.783
We pulled his cell records.

16:41.826 --> 16:43.848
His cell pinged in the vicinity
of the past six burglaries,

16:43.872 --> 16:46.068
and the night Suggs was killed,
Aidan's phone pinged a tower

16:46.092 --> 16:48.050
within a mile
of the crime scene.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.531
Okay, bring him in,
just step light.

16:50.574 --> 16:52.639
I don't want any of you
coming out of the Gardens today

16:52.663 --> 16:55.275
with a story or a scar.

17:07.461 --> 17:09.070
What the...

17:09.115 --> 17:10.333
Get up!

17:10.377 --> 17:12.770
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey!

17:12.814 --> 17:14.685
Hey, what the hell's going on?

17:18.298 --> 17:20.560
Good afternoon, Officer.

17:20.604 --> 17:23.128
Hey, are you good?

17:23.172 --> 17:24.260
Screw off.

17:26.219 --> 17:27.568
Are you good or no?

17:27.611 --> 17:29.178
He said he good.

17:30.658 --> 17:32.312
You good, right?

17:32.355 --> 17:34.140
We're just joking around.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.100
Just nonsense.

17:38.144 --> 17:40.320
Yeah and what?
You just watching?

17:40.363 --> 17:41.930
Ain't got nothing to do with me.

17:41.973 --> 17:44.672
- Okay, I see you.
- What you doing around here?

17:44.715 --> 17:46.369
I don't need to tell you that.

17:46.413 --> 17:49.024
What? You wanna search me?

17:49.807 --> 17:51.331
No, I want you to back up.

17:51.374 --> 17:53.028
I ain't going nowhere.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.249
You think I'm playing with you?

17:56.292 --> 17:58.512
Jay, we're good.

17:58.555 --> 17:59.904
We're just passing through,

17:59.948 --> 18:01.186
but we're happy
to circle back around

18:01.210 --> 18:02.777
if you don't move out
of the way.

18:12.047 --> 18:15.572
Yeah, do what your
lady friend told you to do,

18:15.616 --> 18:17.096
partner.

18:21.404 --> 18:22.884
Aiden's over there.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.364
I got Aiden leaving the Gardens,

18:24.407 --> 18:25.974
he's wearing a navy jacket,

18:26.017 --> 18:27.715
jeans and white sneakers.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.325
Copy, let's give him some space.

18:29.369 --> 18:30.935
We'll take him outside
the Gardens,

18:30.979 --> 18:32.589
there's too many people
around here.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.809
We'll take the West,
you guys tie him in on foot.

18:46.299 --> 18:49.432
He's still walking
eastbound on Riverside.

18:49.476 --> 18:51.173
Copy that.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.184
I'm hopping out on foot.

19:14.849 --> 19:16.764
He's running.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.419
He's going south on a gangway.

19:19.462 --> 19:22.726
Police, stop!

19:23.727 --> 19:25.512
Chicago PD!

19:25.555 --> 19:27.601
Stop where you are,
put your hands up!

19:27.644 --> 19:30.125
Police, stop!

19:30.169 --> 19:31.866
Police, stop! Put your hands up!

19:31.909 --> 19:34.608
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't you raise that gun at me!

19:34.651 --> 19:36.175
Don't you raise that gun!

19:36.218 --> 19:38.133
Put it down, man.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.440
Hey, you're Aiden, right?
Your name's Aiden?

19:40.483 --> 19:42.920
I'm Jay, I'm a detective.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.898
Listen, you saved that
man's life at the burglary.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.272
I know you don't want
to shoot me.

19:46.315 --> 19:47.621
Put it down.

19:47.664 --> 19:49.294
Look, you don't want to be
in this situation

19:49.318 --> 19:50.624
any more than I do right now,

19:50.667 --> 19:53.192
so put the gun down
before this gets worse.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.976
Put it down.

19:59.894 --> 20:02.244
Kid, trust me, okay?

20:02.288 --> 20:03.463
You put the gun down,

20:03.506 --> 20:05.049
you and I can work this
out together, okay?

20:05.073 --> 20:06.379
I promise, just put it down.

20:06.422 --> 20:08.903
Please, please put it down.
I'm begging you.

20:08.946 --> 20:11.645
Please, kid, put it down, man!
Put it down!

20:11.688 --> 20:14.169
You got to put it down
right now.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.823
Okay, turn around.
Get against the wall.

20:15.866 --> 20:18.869
Get against the wall,
get against the wall.

20:23.309 --> 20:25.441
All right, we're good.

20:33.144 --> 20:34.798
Your hands okay?

20:34.842 --> 20:37.018
Take a seat.

20:37.061 --> 20:40.326
Aiden, Sergeant Hank Voight.

20:40.369 --> 20:42.719
You know Detective Halstead.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.419
You understand why
you're here, right?

20:47.594 --> 20:49.813
Then you know you're in
some trouble.

20:50.901 --> 20:54.514
What we want to know now is...

20:54.557 --> 20:56.603
what happened to the man
you were working with?

21:07.353 --> 21:08.789
Are these real?

21:08.832 --> 21:10.312
Yeah, they're real.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.227
What happened, Aidan?

21:16.884 --> 21:18.668
It's all my fault.

21:18.712 --> 21:20.322
Did you kill him?

21:20.366 --> 21:22.019
'Cause I think Suggs
was handing you

21:22.063 --> 21:23.325
and the other kid a key.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.414
You'd drive up,
he'd hand it off...

21:25.458 --> 21:28.287
but when you went to give
it back, something went wrong.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.767
He told you he wasn't
gonna do it anymore.

21:33.204 --> 21:34.467
You're wrong about it all.

21:34.510 --> 21:36.947
Okay, what's right?

21:36.991 --> 21:39.559
Suggs didn't do nothing
wrong, it was all me.

21:42.779 --> 21:44.868
He never gave me a key,
I stole it.

21:44.912 --> 21:47.741
So you stole a key off
of him multiple times?

21:49.003 --> 21:51.005
Aidan, I know that's not true.

21:51.048 --> 21:53.224
It is.

21:53.268 --> 21:54.965
It is, it's what I'm saying.

21:55.009 --> 21:58.404
II want to write it down or
sign it or whatever I have to...

21:58.447 --> 21:59.927
A confession?

21:59.970 --> 22:01.145
I can do that right?

22:01.189 --> 22:03.365
That's what I wanna do.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.343
I don't want a lawyer
or a phone call or whatever,

22:05.367 --> 22:07.064
I just want to write
my confession down

22:07.108 --> 22:08.501
and sign it off.

22:08.544 --> 22:11.112
I stole the key,
I did the burglary,

22:11.155 --> 22:12.809
it was all me, not Suggs.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.514
Sarge, can I talk to you
in the hallway?

22:37.138 --> 22:38.922
What?

22:40.446 --> 22:42.404
What are you doing?

22:42.448 --> 22:44.014
The kid is lying.

22:44.058 --> 22:46.408
It feels wronghe's gonna
end up eating that murder.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.367
Yeah, well, he
just confessed to half of it.

22:48.410 --> 22:49.716
He's only lying about the key.

22:49.759 --> 22:51.326
Keep pressing him,
he's gonna crack.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.155
Well, maybe
that's why we shouldn't.

22:54.198 --> 22:55.765
The kid's protecting Suggs.

22:55.809 --> 22:57.811
I think he's trying
to be brave, noble.

22:57.854 --> 23:00.335
Look, it doesn't matter
why he wants to talk.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.337
Sorry. Yo, Sarge.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.470
A friend of yours is downstairs.

23:15.655 --> 23:19.441
You guys have any of
that organic non-fat soy milk?

23:19.485 --> 23:21.878
The one with the cow on it?

23:21.922 --> 23:25.099
This sludge would taste
a whole lot better.

23:25.142 --> 23:27.536
Are you good with all that?

23:28.711 --> 23:30.757
No, I'd like to change it

23:30.800 --> 23:32.976
to a simple "thank you
for the coffee."

23:34.978 --> 23:36.763
Would you please?

23:38.504 --> 23:40.462
I heard you made an arrest.

23:40.506 --> 23:42.421
You get a confession?

23:42.464 --> 23:46.207
We got a kid who's claiming
he stole the key off Suggs.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.165
Well, that's good.

23:48.209 --> 23:50.777
Yeah, except the kid's lying.

23:53.083 --> 23:57.044
We got video of Suggs handing
the key off willingly.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.743
Um...

24:05.835 --> 24:08.055
Can that video live off record?

24:08.098 --> 24:11.101
You know, Ray, if you're
gonna come here as a friend

24:11.145 --> 24:13.626
asking me a favor

24:13.669 --> 24:15.497
I think the least
you can do is tell me

24:15.541 --> 24:18.239
the real reason you're asking.

24:18.935 --> 24:24.419
You want CFD's endorsement
for mayor.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.160
Now I'm guessing
this is what Grissom

24:26.203 --> 24:29.206
is asking you in exchange.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.731
You want to be upfront?

24:34.298 --> 24:36.866
All I need from you is a case

24:36.910 --> 24:38.955
where I can stand
in front of podium

24:38.999 --> 24:42.393
and say "Suggs was a good man",

24:42.437 --> 24:46.049
"a man who's getting
his full pension,

24:46.093 --> 24:48.574
"a man who has the backing
of Chicago Fire,

24:48.617 --> 24:51.185
and the Chicago
Police Departments."

24:56.059 --> 24:59.498
And that is about
as upfront as I can be.

25:03.197 --> 25:04.590
If we go back in that room,

25:04.633 --> 25:06.548
that kid's gonna incriminate
himself for murder.

25:06.592 --> 25:07.952
- Or he's gonna confess.
- Falsely.

25:07.984 --> 25:09.290
Come on, you can't know that.

25:09.333 --> 25:10.683
He's not a killer.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.249
I don't think either
of them are.

25:12.293 --> 25:14.295
Okay, look, Aidan's phone
puts him in the area

25:14.338 --> 25:16.645
and we recovered a 9mm on him.

25:16.689 --> 25:18.734
I don't think he's capable
of pulling a trigger.

25:18.778 --> 25:20.799
I saw something you didn't see,
you got to trust me.

25:20.823 --> 25:22.564
What we know for sure
is the kid's lying.

25:22.608 --> 25:25.480
Suggs was willingly
handing off that key.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.308
The question is why?

25:27.351 --> 25:29.310
And who's the kid working with?

25:29.353 --> 25:30.877
Sarge, we're close to something.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.637
We did a crosscheck of all
the boys in the Garden

25:32.661 --> 25:34.160
who've been popped
in the last two years,

25:34.184 --> 25:36.447
15 and under.
And a Chris Howard kicks out.

25:36.491 --> 25:37.729
He lives on the same block
as Aidan,

25:37.753 --> 25:39.712
and there's a green Toyota Camry

25:39.755 --> 25:41.452
registered to his aunt's name.

25:41.496 --> 25:42.647
That's the same make and model

25:42.671 --> 25:44.934
seen at the last burglary.

25:44.978 --> 25:48.024
Okay, so is it just a feeling?

25:49.983 --> 25:51.375
Yeah.

25:51.419 --> 25:53.247
Well, let's talk to this Chris.

25:53.290 --> 25:55.249
Do it someplace quiet,
off the record,

25:55.292 --> 25:57.033
no one writes anything down.

25:57.077 --> 25:59.122
Let's hope you're right.

26:04.214 --> 26:05.781
Let's go.

26:08.828 --> 26:10.090
Chris?

26:10.133 --> 26:12.701
Yeah, don't worry.
Nobody snitched, okay?

26:12.745 --> 26:14.964
We found you both
through police work.

26:17.837 --> 26:19.403
Why the hell are we down here?

26:19.447 --> 26:20.883
Why are you here?

26:20.927 --> 26:23.320
'Cause that's where Suggs
was killed.

26:29.326 --> 26:31.111
Suggs is dead?

26:31.154 --> 26:33.766
Yeah, Suggs is dead.

26:35.115 --> 26:37.160
Hey.

26:38.858 --> 26:40.511
The other reason you're
down here

26:40.555 --> 26:45.081
is 'cause there's no cameras,
no recordings, no cops.

26:46.735 --> 26:50.086
So what you say here stays here.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.673
Look, I already told you
that I would...

26:51.697 --> 26:53.176
I would write it down and...

26:53.220 --> 26:55.135
Yeah, I know, Aiden.
I remember what you said.

26:55.962 --> 26:58.965
Now I don't think you get it,
Okay? Listen.

26:59.008 --> 27:01.097
Suggs was a Chicago firefighter,

27:01.141 --> 27:04.492
he dedicated his life
to this city.

27:04.535 --> 27:09.540
And believe me, this city
is dedicating everything it has

27:09.584 --> 27:11.760
to clearing his murder.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.849
And right now,
you two are about to end up

27:13.893 --> 27:15.372
on the wrong end
of that dedication,

27:15.416 --> 27:16.678
you understand?

27:16.722 --> 27:19.594
I'm talking about
life in prison.

27:20.987 --> 27:22.815
I'm gonna tell you what I know.

27:22.858 --> 27:26.122
I know Suggs gave you that key.

27:26.166 --> 27:28.864
I know you two committed
those burglaries,

27:28.908 --> 27:31.693
I know Suggs wanted out,
and he ended up dead.

27:35.305 --> 27:39.745
What I don't know is why.

27:41.050 --> 27:42.661
I've known a lot of guys
like Suggs,

27:42.704 --> 27:45.054
guys who just want to help
people for a living.

27:45.098 --> 27:47.317
There's no way a man like that,
a good man,

27:47.361 --> 27:49.885
is gonna give you that key,
knowing what you're gonna

27:49.929 --> 27:51.887
to do with it, unless he had
a damn good reason.

27:51.931 --> 27:54.542
That's right, and we want
to know what's the reason,

27:54.585 --> 27:55.978
so... you force him?

27:56.022 --> 27:58.415
- What?
- Did you make him do it?

27:58.459 --> 28:00.766
- Nobody forced anything...
- All right, then why?

28:00.809 --> 28:02.419
- Aidan, stop!
- If you're lying

28:02.463 --> 28:04.136
to protect him, it means
you knew he was a good man.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.814
Of course I know
he's a good man, but...

28:05.858 --> 28:07.052
So why would
he give you the key?

28:07.076 --> 28:08.338
It's not like we had a choice!

28:08.382 --> 28:09.862
Aidan, you're not helping us!

28:09.905 --> 28:11.646
I'm not hurting us either,
bro, it's over!

28:11.690 --> 28:13.779
- What do you mean?
- Okay? He's dead!

28:15.302 --> 28:17.260
That's 'cause of us.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.746
Talk to me.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.922
Look, Suggs tried
everything else, y'all.

28:26.966 --> 28:29.011
It wasit only made it worse.

28:29.055 --> 28:31.971
We weren't ever going
to hurt anybody.

28:32.014 --> 28:33.929
We were supposed
to rob a couple of places

28:33.973 --> 28:35.515
until we could pay it off,
and then that was it.

28:35.539 --> 28:37.169
- Pay for what?
- Just a couple more places,

28:37.193 --> 28:38.717
- and that was it!
- Pay for what?

28:38.760 --> 28:41.807
Our freedom!

28:45.027 --> 28:48.465
That's it. We just...
We're just buying our way out.

28:57.257 --> 28:59.738
Vyshonne Kamen, he's an
enforcer for the G Park Lords.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.261
It's his job is to keep
kids in line.

29:01.304 --> 29:02.871
He's known for "20, no cover."

29:02.915 --> 29:04.806
If a kid steps out, they get 20
minutes of a beating.

29:04.830 --> 29:07.267
South Homicide's picked up
two 16-year-olds

29:07.310 --> 29:09.312
beaten to death in the past
six months.

29:09.356 --> 29:10.812
This is the guy we saw
in the Gardens.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.465
Aidan and Chris got plugged
in with Kamen

29:12.489 --> 29:14.100
when they were nine.

29:14.143 --> 29:16.711
Ran dime bags, but between
9 and 15, you gotta grow up

29:16.755 --> 29:18.408
and neither
of those kids are hard.

29:18.452 --> 29:20.062
Right, they wanted out.

29:20.106 --> 29:22.456
Aidan said Suggs understood
and he offered to help them.

29:22.499 --> 29:24.675
So he gave them a lockbox key?

29:24.719 --> 29:27.330
At first, Suggs went
to Kamen, tried to talk to him,

29:27.374 --> 29:28.723
got shut down.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.290
Then he went back,
offered him money,

29:30.333 --> 29:32.727
that's the $3,000.

29:32.771 --> 29:36.426
Kamen told him that the
price tag was 100 grand.

29:36.470 --> 29:40.604
Then Kamen threatened Suggs,
Suggs' kids, the boys.

29:40.648 --> 29:42.476
Wrong thing
for the right reasons.

29:42.519 --> 29:46.523
Right, so we're guessing
Kamen found out about the key

29:46.567 --> 29:48.351
and he saw a much bigger payday,

29:48.395 --> 29:49.831
then Suggs wanted out,

29:49.875 --> 29:51.790
Kamen killed him,
took the key from the kids.

29:51.833 --> 29:54.009
All right, well,
he's got to be at the Gardens.

29:54.053 --> 29:55.750
Yeah, but we can't pick him up.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.360
What do you mean?

29:59.101 --> 30:00.339
All we have is a conversation

30:00.363 --> 30:01.843
that's supposed
to be off record.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.192
So put it on record.

30:03.236 --> 30:04.691
Look, even if we got it
on the record,

30:04.715 --> 30:07.544
brought Kamen in,
had enough to charge murder,

30:07.588 --> 30:09.677
we still don't have proof
of coercion,

30:09.720 --> 30:11.897
and the word of two
15-year-old boys with priors...

30:13.550 --> 30:15.161
Who are guilty of seven
burglaries

30:15.204 --> 30:16.640
is not gonna go far
with the D.A.

30:16.684 --> 30:18.947
Just got a message from Med.

30:18.991 --> 30:22.516
The victim from the burglary
died about a half hour ago.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.346
Kids are looking
at felony murder.

30:29.218 --> 30:31.699
What's the move now?

30:32.874 --> 30:34.876
The truth.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.357
We tell the kids exactly
what we have.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.707
Look, we trusted him,

30:39.750 --> 30:42.275
let's see if the kid trusts us.

30:48.237 --> 30:49.543
Felony murder?

30:49.586 --> 30:51.588
Yeah, that's how
the prosecutor will see it.

30:51.632 --> 30:52.938
If someone dies during a crime,

30:52.981 --> 30:54.200
the perpetrators of that crime

30:54.243 --> 30:56.419
are responsible
for that person's death.

30:56.463 --> 30:59.292
So we're going to jail for life?

30:59.335 --> 31:03.731
Unless we can convince
an ASA of coercion.

31:03.774 --> 31:06.516
If we can get the truth
of what happened,

31:06.560 --> 31:08.083
why you guys were doing
the burglaries,

31:08.127 --> 31:10.216
why Suggs was helping you.

31:10.259 --> 31:11.870
Yeah, but you can't prove
why, can you?

31:11.913 --> 31:15.047
No, but we picked you up
outside the Gardens.

31:15.090 --> 31:16.483
No witnesses that we know of.

31:16.526 --> 31:18.406
We're hoping Kamen
doesn't know you're here yet.

31:18.441 --> 31:19.984
He still has the key,
and he still thinks

31:20.008 --> 31:22.315
you guys are gonna
keep on doing work for him.

31:22.358 --> 31:25.231
So one of you could wear a wire.

31:25.274 --> 31:27.755
Hell no!

31:28.712 --> 31:31.324
- We're not gonna force you.
- Then no way!

31:31.367 --> 31:33.108
Okay.

31:36.982 --> 31:39.375
Man, I'm the reason Kamen
even knows about the key.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.164
He didn't understand how we
were raking in so much cash,

31:45.207 --> 31:46.643
so I mouthed off to him.

31:46.687 --> 31:48.819
I didn't even think
he even heard me.

31:50.604 --> 31:53.607
I'll do it. It's cool.

31:54.825 --> 31:57.393
I'll do it.

32:09.971 --> 32:12.365
All right, kid's moving.

32:13.322 --> 32:15.934
What, bro? Get outta here!

32:18.023 --> 32:20.677
All right, Aidan's inside.
Now everybody, stay back.

32:20.721 --> 32:22.462
No one gets any closer.

32:22.505 --> 32:24.072
Kev, you good?

32:25.682 --> 32:28.772
I'm good. The kid looks
a little nervous though.

32:28.816 --> 32:30.687
Just remember,
keep your back turned.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.689
Kamen's gonna walk in
and walk right back out

32:32.733 --> 32:34.996
if he sees you're not
from the neighborhood.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.477
Copy that.

32:41.872 --> 32:44.005
Boss, we got eyes from
the sound end.

32:44.049 --> 32:45.920
There's a silver Yukon
pulling up,

32:45.964 --> 32:48.444
same vehicle we saw
at Aldrich Gardens.

32:55.495 --> 32:57.584
Got a positive, Kamen's on site.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.281
Black jacket, jeans.

32:59.325 --> 33:01.414
Copy that.

33:01.457 --> 33:02.937
Okay, we're up.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.418
Remember,
we got one chance here.

33:23.914 --> 33:26.091
Why am I hearing
you're looking for me?

33:26.917 --> 33:28.832
I got a location
I think that looks good...

33:28.876 --> 33:31.487
hey, hey, hey. Come on, man,
don't talk like that in here.

33:34.012 --> 33:37.058
You ain't getting nothing
to eat?

33:37.102 --> 33:38.668
I'm not hungry.

33:41.062 --> 33:43.934
Stupid place to meet me then.

33:45.458 --> 33:47.634
Yo, I just wanna work.

33:47.677 --> 33:50.028
You want to work, you'll work.

33:50.071 --> 33:52.465
And then I'll be good
though, right?

33:53.509 --> 33:55.207
Look, we said 100k,
and then I was gonna...

33:55.250 --> 33:57.383
100k and what?

33:57.426 --> 33:59.080
You get an exit?

33:59.124 --> 34:00.995
Well, we said thatthat...

34:01.039 --> 34:02.692
Boy.

34:02.736 --> 34:05.695
Man, Suggs really did
a number on you, man.

34:06.783 --> 34:08.697
Messed your head all up.

34:09.656 --> 34:11.266
Guy picks out a building,

34:11.310 --> 34:12.789
gives you a plan,

34:12.833 --> 34:15.574
tells you apartment
number, a time,

34:15.618 --> 34:18.534
he even has a little key?

34:20.406 --> 34:22.799
It's a damn fairy tale.

34:23.800 --> 34:27.978
And after, y'all both gonna
be good, right? All good?

34:30.719 --> 34:32.809
It don't work like that, shorty.

34:34.550 --> 34:37.161
Ain't no more outs.

34:40.426 --> 34:44.734
Look, Suggs ain't
protecting you no more, okay?

34:46.606 --> 34:49.565
- You killed him, didn't you?
- Damn right, I killed him.

34:51.263 --> 34:54.135
I take care of problems and
that's what he was, shorty.

34:54.179 --> 34:55.745
He was a problem.

34:58.183 --> 35:00.185
You killed him?

35:17.419 --> 35:18.768
CPD, let him go!

35:18.812 --> 35:20.466
Let's move in now.

35:24.600 --> 35:25.819
Let him go!

35:25.862 --> 35:27.255
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

35:27.299 --> 35:28.667
I told you I wasn't playing
with you, man!

35:28.691 --> 35:30.171
You wanna meet Suggs?

35:30.215 --> 35:33.261
You wanna meet Suggs,
you wanna meet him?

35:37.047 --> 35:38.745
I told you to let him go,
didn't I?

35:47.275 --> 35:48.363
Chicago PD, move!

35:48.407 --> 35:50.800
- Out of the way.
- Move!

35:50.844 --> 35:52.759
Out of the way. Out of the way!

35:56.328 --> 35:58.068
You think I won't?

35:58.939 --> 36:01.855
Hank, Hank, I got him.
I got him.

36:01.898 --> 36:03.509
You okay?

36:03.552 --> 36:04.901
You all right?

36:04.945 --> 36:06.773
Put your hands behind your back.

36:08.905 --> 36:10.907
You did good, all right?

36:21.440 --> 36:24.399
Damn right I killed him!
I take care of problems.

36:24.443 --> 36:27.315
That's what he was, shorty,
he was a problem.

36:27.359 --> 36:30.797
That's a pretty
ironclad confession?

36:30.840 --> 36:34.453
That's the lockbox key
you took from the kids.

36:34.496 --> 36:38.544
This is one of your burners,
the same one Suggs texted.

36:38.587 --> 36:40.198
That sound right?

36:42.200 --> 36:44.332
So you got nothin' to say?

36:46.900 --> 36:49.294
It won't do nothing but help.

36:52.122 --> 36:54.777
- Stand-up guy.
- Yeah.

36:56.083 --> 36:57.432
The boys back in holding?

36:57.476 --> 36:59.347
No, I'm gonna keep them
downstairs with me

36:59.391 --> 37:01.741
until the ASA
signs off on a deal.

37:01.784 --> 37:04.265
Looks like it'll be
a pretty good one.

37:04.309 --> 37:07.094
What you asked for.

37:07.137 --> 37:08.878
Not a bad haul.

37:08.922 --> 37:11.272
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:11.316 --> 37:12.708
You get anything yet?

37:12.752 --> 37:15.407
No, he knows better
than to talk.

37:15.450 --> 37:20.150
Yeah, ballistics came back
on Aidan's gunnot a match.

37:21.369 --> 37:23.632
You were right to trust
your instincts.

37:27.070 --> 37:29.464
Why'd you back me?

37:30.509 --> 37:32.728
You let me talk Aidan down
when, probably,

37:32.772 --> 37:34.121
it didn't make sense to.

37:36.819 --> 37:39.561
Iyou looked at me.

37:40.606 --> 37:44.740
With Aidan, you looked at me,
and I got it.

37:44.784 --> 37:46.699
I trusted you.

37:51.399 --> 37:54.402
I've trusted you
from the day I met you,

37:54.446 --> 37:57.231
and if I was gonna follow
someone blind,

37:57.275 --> 37:59.277
I'd follow you.

38:06.893 --> 38:08.808
See you later.

38:09.852 --> 38:11.898
Yeah.

38:19.645 --> 38:22.778
Ray?

38:22.822 --> 38:26.434
Well, I got
a full confession of murder

38:26.478 --> 38:28.349
from Kamen on the wire.

38:28.393 --> 38:29.916
He admits coercion.

38:29.959 --> 38:34.573
Okay, so we can release
that motive to the press,

38:34.616 --> 38:36.401
it should be enough
to clear Suggs' name

38:36.444 --> 38:37.793
and guarantee his pension.

38:37.837 --> 38:40.535
No, it won't be.
I'm not staying.

38:43.973 --> 38:48.282
The conversation also covers
Suggs' involvement.

38:48.326 --> 38:52.852
He helped the kids plan
the break-ins in detail.

38:55.245 --> 38:56.986
Are you telling me

38:57.030 --> 39:00.207
that you're doing the complete
opposite of what I asked?

39:01.251 --> 39:04.777
The conversation on that wire
clears those boys,

39:04.820 --> 39:08.171
it allows me to get them
a good deal with the ASA.

39:08.215 --> 39:09.999
They're good kids,

39:10.043 --> 39:12.350
they deserve the chance
to become good men.

39:12.393 --> 39:14.874
Yeah, what kind of chance
are they gonna get?

39:14.917 --> 39:17.659
What's the boys' deal?

39:17.703 --> 39:22.142
Got a year or two, but,
I mean, it's JISC but...

39:22.185 --> 39:23.665
JISC is hard.

39:23.709 --> 39:26.625
Even if they're by the console,
they're gonna catch hell.

39:28.496 --> 39:31.456
I'm sorry, Ray. Really.

39:32.718 --> 39:34.633
Hank.

39:40.639 --> 39:43.032
I'm gonna get them into
Lake County Juvenile,

39:43.076 --> 39:45.687
it's better.

39:45.731 --> 39:47.820
Probably do six,

39:47.863 --> 39:51.432
get out, get the chance.

39:58.483 --> 40:01.486
Let's get two more of the same.

40:06.404 --> 40:09.494
I might just be
the real deal, Hank.

40:11.017 --> 40:12.845
Maybe.

40:16.239 --> 40:19.721
So Suggs was planning
the burglaries with them?

40:19.765 --> 40:22.115
I think he thought
he was protecting them.

40:22.158 --> 40:23.812
He was making sure
no one got hurt.

40:23.856 --> 40:28.251
Right, but that's a detail
that won't better much.

40:28.295 --> 40:29.905
Hey, um...

40:31.646 --> 40:33.735
You sure you wanna do this?

40:33.779 --> 40:36.912
I mean, Boden and I,
wewe got her here but...

40:38.697 --> 40:41.177
She wasn't too happy
to come talk to you.

40:41.221 --> 40:42.701
I can't blame her.

40:42.744 --> 40:44.964
She's gonna give you
a hard time.

40:45.007 --> 40:46.748
Yeah, that's okay.

40:46.792 --> 40:48.707
I wanted to...

40:48.750 --> 40:52.450
Bring the collection from 21
for her and Suggs' kids and...

40:53.886 --> 40:57.629
I want to tell her that he was
exactly who she thought he was.
