WEBVTT

01:46.191 --> 01:50.361
We all start off in life
with a dream, don't we?

01:50.445 --> 01:54.073
For a tennis player, it's being
in the final of the Grand Slam...

01:54.157 --> 01:56.826
center court, a high lob,
a smash.

01:56.868 --> 01:59.495
Game, set and match...
you're a champion.

01:59.537 --> 02:02.665
You're number one.

02:02.749 --> 02:06.669
But for most tennis players,
that's all it ever is... a dream.

02:06.711 --> 02:10.048
The reality is another story...
my story.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.218
You see that good-looking fella?

02:13.301 --> 02:17.055
No, not the kid in white.
The other, tired, good-looking fella.

02:17.138 --> 02:19.807
Yeah. Him.
Well, that's me.

02:19.891 --> 02:22.101
British Davis Cup a long time ago.

02:22.185 --> 02:24.604
Two singles titles even longer ago.

02:24.687 --> 02:27.440
Presently ranked 119th in the world.

02:27.524 --> 02:29.442
Sport is cruel.

02:29.526 --> 02:32.987
Now, I know it doesn't
sound too bad.

02:33.071 --> 02:36.157
Four million tennis players in the world,
and I'm 119th.

02:36.241 --> 02:38.409
But what that really means is this...

02:38.493 --> 02:41.746
118 guys out there are faster,

02:41.829 --> 02:44.749
stronger, better and younger.

02:44.833 --> 02:46.876
And it gets you thinking.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.212
You'll be 32 in...
The prime of my life.

02:49.295 --> 02:53.299
How long can Peter Colt keep playing
this game? Time to retire gracefully.

02:53.383 --> 02:56.219
Stop it. Stop it. Just serve.

03:00.765 --> 03:04.394
These young guys... where do they
get the energy, the focus?

03:04.435 --> 03:08.231
No fear. You see,
the one thing you can't have is fear.

03:08.273 --> 03:11.276
And for the first time in my life,
I'm afraid.

03:11.317 --> 03:14.404
Not oflosing.
I'm not even afraid of the kid.

03:14.445 --> 03:18.700
I'm afraid of what happens
if that ball keeps going by me.

03:18.783 --> 03:21.035
What happens then?

03:21.119 --> 03:25.039
I hope you don't mind, but I took
the liberty of having it engraved.

03:25.123 --> 03:27.876
- Wow.
- Exactly.

03:28.877 --> 03:31.921
Frankly, my biggest
problem is parking. Right.

03:31.963 --> 03:34.591
Mm, not for you, of course.
No. Your own space.

03:34.674 --> 03:36.676
Nameplate again.
Oh, good.

03:36.759 --> 03:39.971
Hello, Ian. Is this the young man
you were telling us about?

03:40.054 --> 03:42.140
Mm-hmm. Peter Colt,
the one and only.

03:42.223 --> 03:45.143
Once ranked
15th in the world, I hear.

03:45.226 --> 03:48.313
Uh, 11 th, actually,
for the better part of'96.

03:48.396 --> 03:52.317
Yes. Peter's got himself
a wild card at Wimbledon.

03:52.358 --> 03:56.905
- Then we're hoping he'll be hanging his racket here at the club.
- Well, we'll see.

03:56.988 --> 04:00.742
We shall look forward to giving you a peek
at our ground strokes. Won't we, ladies?

04:00.825 --> 04:04.787
- Oh, do shut up, Sylvia. Good luck at the championships, young man.
- Thank you very much.

04:04.871 --> 04:08.583
Yes. Carry on.
Uh, Peter. Peter.

04:08.666 --> 04:11.503
Watch the ladies.
Occupational hazard. Of course.

04:11.586 --> 04:13.838
Oh, look at this.
Look at this.

04:13.922 --> 04:17.509
Completely new hybrid.
Yes, developed by the Yanks.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.594
Firm but springy.

04:19.677 --> 04:21.471
Look, Peter.

04:22.847 --> 04:26.309
I can't wait forever. There's
no one else I'd rather... Ian.

04:26.392 --> 04:29.979
Look no further.
You have your tennis director.

04:30.063 --> 04:33.525
Oh, that is splendid.
So splendid.

04:37.153 --> 04:40.323
Oh, look. That's Peter Colt,
the new pro.

04:40.365 --> 04:42.534
Once ranked 17 th
in the world.

04:42.617 --> 04:46.371
Eleventh!
I was ranked 11 th in the world.

04:46.454 --> 04:50.834
What makes one tennis player
different from another?

04:50.875 --> 04:54.462
It isn't a killer forehand or serve.
Lots of people have those.

04:54.546 --> 04:56.464
But the great ones
have something else.

04:56.548 --> 04:58.675
Some say it's a supportive family.

04:58.758 --> 05:02.428
Others say it's being hungry,
really hungry.

05:02.512 --> 05:04.889
But as you can see,
I've never been hungry.

05:06.724 --> 05:10.019
Hello. And as far as a
supportive family goes...

05:10.103 --> 05:12.105
Mum? Dad?

05:13.857 --> 05:16.192
Anybody home?

05:31.916 --> 05:33.918
Hello, Carl.

05:34.002 --> 05:36.045
Life still giving
you trouble, is it?

05:36.129 --> 05:39.007
"Deep Throat. " Director's cut.
Absolute classic.

05:39.090 --> 05:42.719
Hey.

05:42.802 --> 05:45.096
They've been at it like that...
like cats and dogs... for weeks.

05:45.180 --> 05:49.100
You all right, Dad?

05:49.142 --> 05:52.562
Yes, yes, yes.

05:52.604 --> 05:53.897
You got our Wimbledon tickets
sorted yet?

05:53.938 --> 05:56.774
'Cause, you know, I don't
wanna miss your grand finale.

05:56.858 --> 06:01.112
Interesting bit of trivia actually. I've never won
a match at Wimbledon with my family in attendance.

06:01.196 --> 06:03.114
We're not invited?
No.

06:03.198 --> 06:05.742
- She's not gonna like that.
- What won't I like?

06:05.783 --> 06:09.078
Hello, darling.
You're looking rather gaunt.

06:09.120 --> 06:13.416
Thank you. Why is Dad so
upset? Oh. Ridiculous man.

06:13.458 --> 06:16.252
For some reason, he believes
I'm having an affair with Eliot Larkin.

06:16.294 --> 06:19.506
Mother. He saw you snogging
in the club car park.

06:19.589 --> 06:22.258
Well, that would do it.
Not in the kitchen.

06:23.301 --> 06:25.428
I wanted your father to see us.
That was the point.

06:25.512 --> 06:29.390
Shake him out of his stupor,
compel him to act.

06:30.475 --> 06:34.229
I hear you're planning to retire
to babysit a bunch of old ladies.

06:34.312 --> 06:37.899
Not what your father and I had in mind
all those years ago cheering you on.

06:37.982 --> 06:41.903
And do you know why? Because I believe
you to be a truly great tennis player.

06:41.986 --> 06:45.114
Oh, God. You've just always been
afraid to admit it to yourself.

06:45.156 --> 06:47.325
I'm not afraid. I'm
old. Oh, don't be absurd.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.452
Thirty-one is not old.
It is in tennis years.

06:49.494 --> 06:52.288
I might as well be your age.
Thank you, dear.

06:52.372 --> 06:54.374
And I'm tired of hotels,
and I'm tired of airports...

06:54.457 --> 06:56.960
and long-distance love affairs
that never go anywhere and...

06:57.001 --> 07:00.338
- Losing?
- Yeah, losing. Thanks, Carl.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.173
Now tell her about the tickets.

07:02.257 --> 07:04.217
Tickets?

07:04.300 --> 07:06.302
Oh, God. You really are
a wanker, aren't you?

07:07.345 --> 07:09.639
Harsh but fair.

07:09.722 --> 07:12.809
Why doesn't he have the tickets?

07:12.892 --> 07:14.853
I mean, do you know why?
What does he think?

07:14.894 --> 07:17.146
Does he think we're going to sit
here watching it on television?

07:17.230 --> 07:21.192
Dad, what are you doing up there?

07:21.234 --> 07:23.444
I should've moved up here
years ago.

07:25.864 --> 07:29.325
Right. Well, I'm off up
to Wimbledon then. Righto.

07:31.828 --> 07:33.830
Peter.
Yeah.

07:33.872 --> 07:38.543
Remember I always told you
that tennis was a gentleman's game?

07:38.626 --> 07:41.129
Yeah.
Total bollocks.

07:41.212 --> 07:45.550
Everything I ever told you...
total bollocks.

07:48.303 --> 07:50.221
Right then.

08:10.575 --> 08:13.411
- Welcome to the Dorchester, Mr. Colt.
- Thank you.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.205
You have a suite, top floor.
Wonderful view.

08:15.246 --> 08:17.749
Really, I think
you might have made a...

08:17.832 --> 08:21.628
Thank you.

08:42.815 --> 08:44.776
Wow.

08:52.825 --> 08:55.036
Well, they weren't wrong
about the view.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.877
You need something?
Yeah, I...

09:02.961 --> 09:06.756
I'm so sorry.
I was given the key to Room 1221.

09:06.798 --> 09:11.553
This is Room 1221...
my 1221.

09:11.636 --> 09:15.265
Oh, right. Your 1221.
Well, that makes perfect sense.

09:15.348 --> 09:19.602
- What makes perfect sense?
- You see, I'd reserved a more modest room.

09:19.686 --> 09:22.397
Now I'll go down
to the front desk and...

09:22.480 --> 09:24.899
thank them for this dreadful error.

09:24.983 --> 09:27.068
Good-bye then.

09:27.151 --> 09:30.280
Yes, good-bye. And may
I say good body... Luck!

09:30.363 --> 09:31.990
Shit. I meant...

09:33.324 --> 09:35.577
Shit.

09:40.331 --> 09:43.293
Oh. Lovely kitchen.

09:43.334 --> 09:44.961
This way.

09:55.221 --> 09:57.307
See now? That's much cozier.

09:58.349 --> 10:01.019
Yeah. I get a lot of questions
about my personal life.

10:01.102 --> 10:04.522
- I usually don't answer them.
- That's why it's called a personal life.

10:04.606 --> 10:07.150
Right. I mean, I just want
to focus on my game, you know?

10:07.192 --> 10:10.486
Unfortunately... I have to agree
with my dad on this one...

10:10.528 --> 10:12.947
all that other stuff
just gets in the way.

10:13.031 --> 10:15.325
But, Lizzie, you have had problems
with chair umpires this year.

10:15.408 --> 10:18.536
Some of the players think you go
out of your way to disrupt a match.

10:18.620 --> 10:21.247
I really don't.
I mean, you know,

10:21.331 --> 10:23.791
maybe I go a little
over the top sometimes,

10:23.875 --> 10:27.712
but, you know, maybe that's what
I need to do to play my best.

10:27.795 --> 10:30.840
And that's why I came to London...
to win Wimbledon.

10:30.882 --> 10:32.675
We'll be watching.
Good luck.

10:32.759 --> 10:35.678
Gonna knock 'em dead this year, Peter?
That's the idea, Danny.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.889
I've got a strong feeling.
Thanks, Danny.

10:37.972 --> 10:40.517
Gonna knock 'em dead this year,
Ivan? I'll do my best for you.

10:40.558 --> 10:42.519
I've got a strong feeling.

10:47.607 --> 10:50.944
- See you later.
- Hey, Dieter. You wanna go for dinner?

10:51.027 --> 10:54.739
Afraid not. There's a chance I
may get lucky tonight. Oh, really?

10:54.822 --> 10:57.033
Intriguing Irish girl.
Her father owns much of Dublin.

10:57.116 --> 10:59.369
Excellent.
She have a sister?

10:59.452 --> 11:01.704
Only child.
Tragic.

11:01.746 --> 11:03.706
I should stay
and work on my serve anyway.

11:03.748 --> 11:06.543
This is my last hurrah.
I wanna go out in style.

11:06.584 --> 11:09.420
Well, that's the spirit, old man.

11:17.262 --> 11:19.222
Bugger.

11:21.307 --> 11:23.059
Oops.

11:23.142 --> 11:27.188
Sorry. Wrong court.
Forgotten me already?

11:27.272 --> 11:29.899
God, no. You're the lady with
the lovely... kitchen. Uh-huh.

11:29.983 --> 11:32.527
Lizzie Bradbury, right?
And you're?

11:32.610 --> 11:36.906
Peter. Peter Colt. Nice to
meet you, Peter Peter Colt.

11:36.990 --> 11:40.827
- Five quid says you can't do it again.
- Mm-hmm.

11:45.790 --> 11:48.459
Ten bucks says
you can't hit two in a row.

11:48.543 --> 11:50.461
You're on.

11:55.633 --> 11:57.594
Lovely form.
Thank you.

12:02.849 --> 12:06.603
Hmm. You're exceeding my
expectations. Mine too.

12:06.644 --> 12:08.938
Do it with a slice serve,
I'll treat you to fish-and-chips.

12:08.980 --> 12:11.482
Ooh. The pressure's on.

12:13.693 --> 12:15.653
Lovely toss.

12:15.695 --> 12:18.948
- Fish-and-chips it is then. - Lizzie,
sweetheart, what the heck are you doing?

12:19.032 --> 12:23.328
- Oh, just one more serve, Daddy.
- You gotta be back in the hotel in 20 minutes for an interview.

12:23.411 --> 12:25.830
Two seconds, okay?

12:27.373 --> 12:30.001
It's funny. You don't seem
the "Daddy" type.

12:32.670 --> 12:35.423
Hit this one,
and I'll sleep with you.

12:35.507 --> 12:38.343
I'm so sorry!

12:38.384 --> 12:41.679
Too bad. You could've
used the workout.

12:49.103 --> 12:51.856
Hello, and welcome to day one
of the championships,

12:51.940 --> 12:54.651
where the players meeting
on center court today...

12:54.692 --> 12:56.778
include Andy Roddick,
Serena Williams...

12:56.861 --> 13:00.823
and Britain's best hope for a title,
Tom Cavendish.

13:00.907 --> 13:04.035
Other Brits in action include
journeyman veteran Peter Colt.

13:04.118 --> 13:08.039
And today marks the Wimbledon
debut of American Lizzie Bradbury.

13:08.081 --> 13:10.333
We'll see if she can live up
to her lively reputation.

13:10.416 --> 13:12.377
What are you talking about?

13:12.418 --> 13:14.796
The chalk flew up.
There's a mark right there.

13:14.879 --> 13:17.340
- The ball was out.
- Get on with it!

13:17.382 --> 13:19.133
You know what,
I'll let it go.

13:19.217 --> 13:21.803
'Cause you obviously can't see it,
and I feel sorry for you.

13:21.886 --> 13:23.555
30-15.

13:26.724 --> 13:28.935
Quiet, please.

13:33.565 --> 13:35.358
40-15.
Yes!

13:40.405 --> 13:42.699
How are you doing?
What time's your match?

13:42.740 --> 13:45.702
3:00. Ajay Bhatt.
You ever heard of him?

13:45.743 --> 13:47.704
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:47.745 --> 13:50.039
He's sitting over
there. Look. Oh, my God.

13:50.081 --> 13:52.584
Shouldn't he be off
discovering masturbation or something?

13:52.625 --> 13:54.878
Played him at Bogota.
He's like all young men...

13:54.919 --> 13:58.214
out to destroy us,
to kill the father.

13:58.256 --> 14:01.259
And like all young men, he must
first be taught the lesson ofhumility.

14:01.342 --> 14:04.387
Exactly. And you taught him
that lesson in Bogota?

14:04.470 --> 14:08.892
Sadly, no. He killed the father...
straight sets.

14:08.933 --> 14:10.935
Watch out for his backhand.

14:22.780 --> 14:24.866
Twenty pound to win...
Ajay Bhatt.

14:24.949 --> 14:27.744
Hold on. Hold on.
Isn't he playing your brother?

14:27.785 --> 14:30.079
You should be ashamed of yourself.

14:30.121 --> 14:32.582
Yeah, but, curiously, I'm not.

14:37.795 --> 14:40.548
So this is it.
This is the end.

14:40.632 --> 14:42.550
This is what it looks like.

14:42.634 --> 14:46.554
1,000 balls a day,
300 days a year, for 25 years.

14:46.638 --> 14:48.723
Six million balls.

14:48.806 --> 14:50.767
And it all ends here,

14:50.850 --> 14:53.102
at 2:00 in the afternoon
on Court 17...

14:53.186 --> 14:57.190
while they're over on center court screaming
for the latest Russian teenage beauty.

14:59.234 --> 15:01.778
Well, let's see if I can at least
make it last a little while.

15:01.819 --> 15:04.572
Ajay.! Come on, Ajay.!

15:04.656 --> 15:08.159
- Good luck, Mr. Colt.
- Thank you.

15:10.995 --> 15:13.289
Bhatt to serve.
First set.

15:13.373 --> 15:15.959
Right then.

15:17.961 --> 15:20.755
Play.

15:28.012 --> 15:31.015
Love-15.

15:33.977 --> 15:36.604
Okay, nice. Not embarrassing.

15:36.688 --> 15:40.024
Another 71 like it,
and you've got it in the bag.

15:40.108 --> 15:42.819
Oi.! Bloody rabbit.! Shoo.!

15:42.861 --> 15:46.447
Crowd Cheering,
Announcer, Indistinct]

15:46.531 --> 15:48.783
We have our first match point.
Yes.! Come on.

15:48.867 --> 15:51.661
I must say he's playing with
newfound confidence today.

15:51.703 --> 15:55.331
Yes. So here we are... match point.

15:55.415 --> 15:59.043
Yes.! Come on.! Get it.!

15:59.127 --> 16:02.005
Yes.! Good shot.!
Well done.! Come on.!

16:02.046 --> 16:03.840
Come on.! Yes.!
That's it.!

16:03.882 --> 16:06.801
He's done it.!
He's done it.!

16:06.885 --> 16:08.803
He's through round one!

16:08.887 --> 16:10.847
Not interested.

16:12.015 --> 16:15.643
What?
Not interested.

16:15.727 --> 16:18.354
Oh, suit yourself.

16:18.438 --> 16:21.900
So you think that kid
has a future. Yes, I do.

16:21.983 --> 16:24.903
I expect, one day, to be
the answer to the trivia question:

16:24.986 --> 16:28.031
Who beat Ajay Bhatt
in his first ever Grand Slam?

16:28.114 --> 16:30.909
What Wimbledon is this
for you, Peter?

16:30.992 --> 16:33.453
It's my 13th actually.

16:33.536 --> 16:36.539
And since this may well be my last
Wimbledon press conference,

16:36.623 --> 16:41.544
um, I'd like to take the opportunity
to announce my retirement from... Jake.!

16:41.586 --> 16:43.421
Please. Come on, man.

16:43.505 --> 16:45.423
tennis.

16:47.342 --> 16:50.553
That's my retirement from tennis...

16:52.597 --> 16:56.267
effective the moment
this tournament ends.

16:57.685 --> 17:00.104
Lizzie!

17:00.188 --> 17:02.190
Tomorrow morning, I want you
at the rear entrance, 9:00 sharp.

17:02.273 --> 17:04.526
We can avoid all of this, all
right? Yeah, you're probably right.

17:04.608 --> 17:08.029
Excuse me, ladies, if you please. Come
on, sweetheart. Hey, Lizzie! Lizzie!

17:08.112 --> 17:12.032
- Jake.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

17:12.116 --> 17:16.746
Excuse me.
How's your injury?

17:16.829 --> 17:20.083
You have one new message.

17:20.165 --> 17:24.127
Congratulations.
You still owe me fish-and-chips.

17:24.170 --> 17:27.131
Uh, say, 7:00?
Room 1221.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.300
That's my 1221.
Oh, bollocks!

17:48.194 --> 17:50.154
It's open.

17:50.238 --> 17:52.949
...kuiper belt appears tonight
in the northern sky.

17:52.991 --> 17:56.202
Once mistaken for a shooting star,
the comet gained its name...

17:56.286 --> 17:59.664
from two U.S. servicemen
on patrol in the South Pacific.

17:59.747 --> 18:02.667
It's the first time in 67 years
it's appeared...

18:02.709 --> 18:05.587
and will be visible to the
naked eye for the next two weeks.

18:05.670 --> 18:09.299
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:11.342 --> 18:14.095
Uh, two fish-and-chips,
as promised. Um...

18:14.179 --> 18:15.638
What?
Let me just...

18:15.722 --> 18:18.850
Oh, geez. How embarrassing. get this.

18:20.518 --> 18:22.353
Are you hungry?

18:22.437 --> 18:25.148
Um, not quite.

18:26.524 --> 18:28.985
I've got a question for you.
All right.

18:29.068 --> 18:32.322
Where do you come down on the whole
"fooling around before a match" issue?

18:34.449 --> 18:36.367
Well, that's a very intriguing question.

18:36.451 --> 18:40.497
'Cause I think a little fooling around
can be really good for your game.

18:40.580 --> 18:42.540
You know, help you relax.

18:42.582 --> 18:47.629
Um, I'm not sure I've done enough
research to have a definitive opinion.

18:47.712 --> 18:49.756
That's very sad.
Yes, it is, isn't it?

18:49.839 --> 18:52.509
It is... very sad.

18:52.550 --> 18:55.053
Don't get me wrong. I'm...

18:55.136 --> 18:58.431
very interested in doing
the necessary research.

19:00.558 --> 19:03.311
Are you?
I'm interested.

19:10.151 --> 19:12.362
Peter?

19:12.403 --> 19:15.281
No one
can know about this, okay?

19:15.365 --> 19:17.784
Really? I had been planning
a brief press statement.

19:17.867 --> 19:21.246
Seriously. Especially my dad.

19:21.329 --> 19:24.374
He's convinced, if there's a guy around,
my first serve gets mushy.

19:24.415 --> 19:26.835
Well, you can't win Wimbledon
with a mushy serve.

19:26.918 --> 19:30.213
No. So... we'll keep it light.

19:30.296 --> 19:32.298
Okay?
Absolutely fine with me.

19:32.382 --> 19:37.053
We'll just keep it, you know,
fun and... relaxed. Relaxed.

19:37.095 --> 19:39.097
Good.

19:44.018 --> 19:46.104
Peter?

19:46.187 --> 19:48.189
Excellent.
More research.

19:50.275 --> 19:53.361
And that's another point lost.
The truth is that Dragomir...

19:53.444 --> 19:55.613
seems to have completely
seized control on this court,

19:55.697 --> 19:58.074
known as
"the graveyard of champions. "

19:58.116 --> 20:01.411
For some reason, Peter
Colt's game this afternoon...

20:01.452 --> 20:03.413
has been less than inspired.

20:03.454 --> 20:06.249
Oh, God! Oh, God, I'm tired.
I'm so tired.

20:06.332 --> 20:08.293
Of course you are.

20:08.334 --> 20:11.296
Stay up all night doing research,
you're bound to be.

20:24.976 --> 20:27.478
Game... Dragomir.
What a pity.

20:27.562 --> 20:31.274
Dragomir leads five games to four in the fourth
set and by two sets to one. Come on, Peter.

20:31.316 --> 20:33.526
Hello! Do you mind?

20:35.486 --> 20:38.239
Bugger. He was doing so well.

20:38.323 --> 20:40.241
I wouldn't write him off
just yet, Pauline.

20:40.325 --> 20:43.953
Some young men, I find,
have a stamina that's...

20:43.995 --> 20:45.955
really quite deceptive.

20:48.333 --> 20:50.460
The second round.
That's not so bad.

20:50.502 --> 20:53.213
He did win the French Open.
At least you got three games off him.

20:53.296 --> 20:56.424
Three games?
Three lousy games?

20:56.508 --> 21:00.595
Last match of your career,
and you got three games?

21:00.678 --> 21:02.597
Time.

21:02.680 --> 21:05.975
It's pathetic.
Come on, Peter.!

21:06.017 --> 21:08.269
Well, at least there's no one here
to see you lose.

21:08.353 --> 21:10.480
Come on, Peter.!

21:12.106 --> 21:13.816
Oh, great.

21:15.902 --> 21:18.488
Come on, Pete.!

21:31.417 --> 21:34.045
Love-15.

21:42.512 --> 21:45.682
Who would have thought, 40 minutes ago,
that we'd be in a fifth set?

21:45.723 --> 21:49.853
But here, Peter Colt... who hasn't beaten a
top-10 player in the past two years, remember...

21:49.936 --> 21:54.524
is at 5-4, three points
from winning the match.

21:54.607 --> 21:56.860
30-love.

22:07.287 --> 22:11.249
- You were with me last match.
- Yes, sir. Brilliant play, sir.

22:11.291 --> 22:14.002
- Do you think I could trouble you...
- Sorry.

22:31.102 --> 22:33.688
40-love.

22:38.359 --> 22:40.361
And we have our first match point.

22:53.958 --> 22:57.587
- Out!
Game, set, match... Colt.

22:57.670 --> 23:00.465
Incredibly,
the English wild card, Peter Colt,

23:00.548 --> 23:03.092
has defeated the French Open champion
to advance to the third round.

23:03.176 --> 23:09.098
- Three sets to two::
6- 4, 4-6, 2-6, 7-5, 6-4.

23:17.315 --> 23:20.318
I thought I'd done my last
one of these. So did we.

23:20.401 --> 23:23.363
So did we. Yeah.

23:23.446 --> 23:28.117
Peter, did you know that Dragomir is the first
seeded player you've defeated in three years?

23:28.201 --> 23:32.080
Yes. Uh, two months and 14 days.
But who's really counting?

23:32.163 --> 23:34.833
What, uh... What do you think
of your next opponent?

23:34.916 --> 23:38.628
Truthfully, in all the excitement, I
haven't even checked to see who it is.

23:38.711 --> 23:41.798
It's your practice partner.
Dieter Prohl.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.967
So two friends must now
face each other as enemies.

23:44.008 --> 23:48.721
An intriguing existential
dilemma. Room 1221, please. Right.

23:50.014 --> 23:52.016
Is your elbow playing up?

23:52.100 --> 23:54.978
Well, if I admit to that,
you may use it to your advantage.

23:55.019 --> 23:57.981
Wow. That's terrible.
Is that what our friendship's come to?

23:58.982 --> 24:01.442
Dodgy shoulder maybe?

24:01.526 --> 24:06.114
The truth is, most everything aches. What doesn't,
I can't feel at all. Tell me about it. Hello?

24:06.197 --> 24:08.533
Hello? Mm! We should
still practice together.

24:08.616 --> 24:11.703
We must stick to the routine. The
hotel offered me a better room.

24:11.786 --> 24:14.455
I told them I'm on a roll at the moment
and I'm not changing rooms.

24:14.539 --> 24:17.375
At such moments, our superstitions
are all we have. Exactly.

24:17.458 --> 24:20.211
Even when I'm taking a shit,
I must do it exactly the same.

24:21.212 --> 24:23.339
I'd never thought of that.
That's genius.

24:23.423 --> 24:26.176
You think of everything important...
you do it the same.

24:26.259 --> 24:29.512
Oh, wait a minute. Yeah. Oh,
that's okay. Put me through.

24:29.596 --> 24:32.932
Lizzie, listen, don't say a word. I was
thinking a repeat of the other night...

24:33.016 --> 24:35.602
like fish-and-chips,
early to bed.

24:35.685 --> 24:38.730
Sh... Mr. Bradbury, hello.

24:39.939 --> 24:43.693
Mr. Bradbury?
Damn.

24:43.776 --> 24:45.737
Yeah?
Yeah.

24:56.080 --> 24:59.542
- Peter.
- Billi.

24:59.626 --> 25:03.922
Come stai?
You are the Dragomir slayer.

25:04.005 --> 25:05.924
How are you?
You look a million... lira.

25:06.007 --> 25:07.926
Oh, thank you, thank you.
I try.

25:08.009 --> 25:09.928
Do you know my partner, Sophia?
No. Hi.

25:10.011 --> 25:12.847
Nice to meet you.
So?

25:12.931 --> 25:15.058
I'm looking for Lizzie
Bradbury. Have you seen her?

25:15.099 --> 25:19.729
No. Maybe you should ask
Jake Hammond. Oh, really? Why?

25:19.812 --> 25:22.774
Why do you think?

25:22.857 --> 25:24.776
Oh, right.
Ah.

25:24.859 --> 25:27.403
Well, I'd better
get a move on. Ciao.

25:28.446 --> 25:30.615
Good luck tomorrow.
Thank you.

25:31.115 --> 25:32.951
Looking for someone?

25:33.034 --> 25:36.287
- Yeah. Ye-Yes. - Wouldn't
happen to be my daughter?

25:36.371 --> 25:38.206
Yes, it would.

25:40.041 --> 25:43.044
It's Colt, right?
Yes, but please call me Peter.

25:43.127 --> 25:47.131
Lizzie's on a roll right now, and I
don't want her to have any distractions.

25:47.215 --> 25:49.592
Right. Of course.

25:51.427 --> 25:53.763
S- Sorry. Just to clarify.
Do you see me as a distraction?

25:53.847 --> 25:56.891
That's exactly how I see you.

25:57.892 --> 26:02.105
So stop looking for her. Stop
calling her. Stop coming around.

26:02.146 --> 26:06.150
Stop every damn thing
that involves my daughter.

26:06.234 --> 26:08.236
Is that clear?

26:25.712 --> 26:29.007
I suppose, in a few thousand years,
the English will evolve webbed feet.

26:29.090 --> 26:33.261
Yes. Just about the same time the
first German evolves a sense of humor.

26:33.344 --> 26:36.973
No, no, no. That's unfair.
Many times, I make you laugh.

26:37.056 --> 26:39.517
No. I'm laughing at
you, not with you. Ha ha.

26:39.559 --> 26:41.311
Somebody wants you.

26:43.104 --> 26:45.773
Oh, you know what? I think
I'll... I think you will too.

26:45.857 --> 26:48.484
See? Now that was quite funny.
Yeah, I know.

26:48.568 --> 26:52.238
Hey, get some rest tonight.
I don't wanna win too easily,

26:52.322 --> 26:54.282
what with you and that,
what is it, bad knee?

26:59.162 --> 27:01.080
I have a little confession
to make.

27:01.164 --> 27:03.333
Oh, God.

27:03.416 --> 27:06.878
When you, uh, walked
into my room the other day,

27:06.961 --> 27:09.255
I knew exactly
who you were.

27:09.339 --> 27:11.299
You did?
Mm-hmm.

27:11.382 --> 27:14.385
I saw you play Tommy Haas
at the Lipton last year.

27:14.469 --> 27:17.889
Oh, shit.
Yeah.

27:17.972 --> 27:20.725
You were ahead, but then you
totally fell apart, remember?

27:20.808 --> 27:25.230
Yes. I recall the ball girl couldn't
get out of the way of my serve.

27:25.271 --> 27:27.565
You gallantly carried her
off the court.

27:27.649 --> 27:31.069
I thought you were such a...
asshole.

27:31.110 --> 27:36.783
To lose like that when you
were playing so beautifully?

27:36.866 --> 27:40.495
I couldn't get it out of my head.
I kept hoping I'd run into you.

27:40.578 --> 27:43.665
Until finally you walked
into my hotel room.

27:43.748 --> 27:45.667
Like a knight in shining armor
perhaps?

27:45.750 --> 27:48.253
No.

27:49.337 --> 27:51.256
Trouble is, I'm the one
that needs saving.

27:52.507 --> 27:56.219
Yesterday, I was losing,
and then I saw you watching.

28:01.140 --> 28:03.393
What?

28:05.520 --> 28:08.565
Perhaps my first serve's
getting a little mushy. Mm-hmm.

28:11.609 --> 28:16.030
This year's love had better last

28:16.114 --> 28:20.243
Heaven knows it's high time

28:20.326 --> 28:25.123
I've been waitin'on my own

28:25.206 --> 28:27.250
Too long

28:29.335 --> 28:33.423
When you hold me
like you do

28:33.464 --> 28:35.717
Oh. Hey, look.

28:35.800 --> 28:39.053
There it is, the comet. See,
with the little tail behind it?

28:40.763 --> 28:42.682
Hardly anything, is it?

28:42.765 --> 28:45.727
Barely moving.

28:45.810 --> 28:47.979
We have to wish on it.

28:51.733 --> 28:54.319
Did you wish
on your next match?

28:54.402 --> 28:57.155
It wouldn't work
if I told you.

28:57.238 --> 29:01.242
Who do you play? Good friend
of mine actually. Dieter Prohl.

29:01.326 --> 29:04.704
A friend? Then you should know
how to beat him.

29:05.997 --> 29:10.543
What are his weaknesses? Um, sausages,
Wagner, men in leather shorts.

29:10.627 --> 29:14.422
In his game. That's why I gave up
having girlfriends in tennis.

29:14.506 --> 29:16.591
You have to dig extra deep
to kill your friends.

29:16.674 --> 29:19.302
Now I have to kill him?
Without thinking twice.

29:19.344 --> 29:21.304
And I don't envy you.
Why's that?

29:21.346 --> 29:23.556
You practice together,
you travel together,

29:23.640 --> 29:25.975
you practically live together.

29:26.017 --> 29:30.647
Do you really have what it takes to close
out a friend in the third round of Wimbledon?

29:30.688 --> 29:33.608
Because that is killing him.

29:33.691 --> 29:36.194
It's a bullet to the heart.

29:36.277 --> 29:38.613
That's what's tough
about this game.

29:38.696 --> 29:40.615
There's a winner,
and there's a loser.

29:40.698 --> 29:43.827
And tomorrow, one of you
is going to be a loser.

29:56.381 --> 29:58.299
Bloody pedals!

30:02.554 --> 30:05.014
All right. Vij.

30:05.056 --> 30:07.016
Wh-Where the hell
are the men's matches?

30:07.058 --> 30:09.894
Man, Roddick lost toJake Hammond
in four sets, mate.

30:09.978 --> 30:11.980
Shit. What about Peter
and Prohl?

30:12.063 --> 30:13.982
Didn't hear?
No.

30:14.065 --> 30:16.901
Straight sets, man. Pete decimated
him. Tore him to pieces, man.

30:16.985 --> 30:19.487
Shit! Oh, what, you
bet against him again?

30:19.571 --> 30:21.823
You know, that bastard
usually comes through for me.

30:21.906 --> 30:23.950
He's been on such
a good losing streak.

30:24.033 --> 30:28.329
Here. Are you, uh, Peter
Colt's brother? Possibly.

30:28.413 --> 30:32.542
I've seen you in here
watchin' the matches. Yeah.

30:32.584 --> 30:36.462
- You could say tennis is my life.
- My passion's chat rooms.

30:36.546 --> 30:39.382
Really? Hmm.

30:40.258 --> 30:43.344
Broadband.
Of course.

30:52.061 --> 30:55.857
You may have humiliated the kraut,
but you're not done with him.

30:55.940 --> 30:58.568
You change your routine
not one iota.

30:58.610 --> 31:03.072
I'm still your practice partner.
Thanks, mate.

31:05.200 --> 31:08.912
Anyway, you know it was
a hell of a lot closer than the score.

31:08.995 --> 31:12.457
A let-cord here or there, it would
have been a different story. Bullshit.

31:12.540 --> 31:14.959
You annihilated me.
You...

31:15.043 --> 31:17.045
You hit from the soul,
the heart.

31:17.128 --> 31:19.923
Something's happened to you.

31:20.006 --> 31:23.968
Something else, something...
The girl in the taxi.

31:24.052 --> 31:27.931
The-The end of the waving hand.
That's...

31:28.014 --> 31:30.934
That's where the fire comes from.
Admit it.

31:30.975 --> 31:32.936
Dieter, listen.

31:33.937 --> 31:36.731
Do you think that,
in the middle of a championship...

31:36.814 --> 31:39.442
and for the first time in years
I'm actually winning,

31:39.484 --> 31:43.112
I'd be dumb enough
to get involved with a woman?

31:43.196 --> 31:45.156
Absolutely.

31:56.835 --> 32:01.548
You have eight new messages.

32:01.631 --> 32:05.134
Well, aren't I popular?

32:05.218 --> 32:10.974
Peter. Ian Frazier from the club. Well done.!
Take as long as you need before you start with us.

32:11.057 --> 32:15.228
Oh, and the, uh... the ladies
send their regards.

32:18.147 --> 32:21.985
You were incredible today.

32:22.068 --> 32:26.281
I have a free day tomorrow.
I'll call you later.

32:26.364 --> 32:28.658
Peter, remember me?

32:28.700 --> 32:31.327
It's your mother.

32:31.369 --> 32:34.789
- I hear congratulations are in order.
- What did I always say about ya?

32:34.873 --> 32:37.500
I don't know. Remind me, Ron.

32:37.542 --> 32:39.711
So, uh, cucumber and cucumber?

32:39.794 --> 32:42.881
And cucumber. They forgot to
put the sandwich in my sandwich.

32:44.174 --> 32:46.843
What are you doing here, Ron?
You're not still my agent, are you?

32:46.926 --> 32:49.012
What are you talkin' about?
What am I talking about?

32:49.053 --> 32:51.389
Okay, well, I called you
about a year ago,

32:51.472 --> 32:54.058
and I'm still waiting
for you to return my call.

32:54.142 --> 32:57.228
Yeah, I'm into e-mails now. I don't
do the, uh, phone thing anymore.

32:57.312 --> 33:00.398
Ron? That's a lie.

33:02.483 --> 33:05.361
Yeah, it's a lie. You want me
to be completely honest with you?

33:05.445 --> 33:09.407
Agents are not miracle workers. We
can't sell a product that doesn't exist.

33:09.491 --> 33:12.202
But here you are existing again,
so I'm back selling again.

33:12.285 --> 33:14.662
You know what, Ron?
I genuinely despise you.

33:14.746 --> 33:17.499
And you know what, Peter?
I really don't take it personally.

33:17.582 --> 33:19.501
Because this could all
be over by Monday.

33:19.584 --> 33:22.378
Cavendish is a serve-and-volley guy, and
you've always played shit against them,

33:22.462 --> 33:24.923
so I'd like to capitalize now
if that's not a problem with you.

33:25.006 --> 33:26.925
I don't want you
to go down in history...

33:27.008 --> 33:29.677
as that English guy who beat
his best friend, the German guy,

33:29.761 --> 33:31.721
only to get beat
by the other English guy.

33:31.763 --> 33:33.723
I'd like to put some money
in your pocket.

33:33.765 --> 33:36.935
You got a problem with that?
You'd have to cut your commission.

33:37.018 --> 33:41.564
Okay, look, unfortunately that's
a no-go area. Everybody pays 10%.

33:41.648 --> 33:44.067
Say five percent,
or the next offer's four.

33:45.652 --> 33:47.654
You know, success
has really changed you.

33:48.738 --> 33:51.199
And I'm loving it.
Screw it. You got a deal.

33:51.282 --> 33:53.743
Besides, I have a funny feeling
that Cavendish is going down.

33:53.827 --> 33:55.787
Tea?
Yes. I'd love some.

33:55.829 --> 34:00.083
Now let's get down to business. Slazenger's
having a cocktail party this evening,

34:00.124 --> 34:04.254
and everybody's dying to meet you
for the very first time... all over again.

34:13.804 --> 34:16.431
- I have a thing later. I'll call you back.
- I'll ring you tomorrow.

34:16.474 --> 34:19.393
That's fine. Tomorrow's
fi... Lizzie. Ronny.

34:19.476 --> 34:21.396
There she is.
How they hangin'?

34:21.478 --> 34:23.940
Fine. And yours? Fine. Who's your
new friend? You going to introduce me?

34:23.982 --> 34:25.942
You haven't met yet?
Hi. I'm Lizzie.

34:25.984 --> 34:28.485
Peter. Peter Colt.
"The" Peter Peter Colt?

34:28.527 --> 34:31.447
- The one and only.
- Oh, I've heard a lot about you.

34:31.489 --> 34:34.284
Oh, really? Nothing good, I hope. That you're
a man who's not afraid to come to the net.

34:34.324 --> 34:38.204
I hear that this is your first Wimbledon, and
you're gonna go all the way. Every chance I get.

34:38.288 --> 34:40.873
Well, well, well. If this
works out, do I get the, uh...

34:40.956 --> 34:45.837
You can have 10% of our
kids. The kids. That's a...

34:45.920 --> 34:48.965
Are you all right? You
look beautiful. Thank you.

34:49.047 --> 34:53.594
You come along and play matchmaker? Did I do
that? I'm sorry. I just got excited by the math.

34:53.678 --> 34:56.472
Let's just have a drink.
We can talk over this whole Nike thing,

34:56.514 --> 34:59.017
and you'll still have her home
before she turns into a pumpkin.

35:01.352 --> 35:04.647
One day,
none of this will be ours.

35:06.733 --> 35:09.819
Oh, no.
Asshole incoming. 4:00.

35:09.903 --> 35:12.655
Lizzie, what's the deal? I've left
you, like, half a dozen messages.

35:12.697 --> 35:15.033
Oh, really?
How about that?

35:15.116 --> 35:18.286
Hi.
Do you know Peter Colt?

35:18.369 --> 35:20.997
Yeah, we did meet once.
First round, San Jose, last year.

35:21.039 --> 35:23.166
Exactly.
A memorable match.

35:23.249 --> 35:26.836
Yeah, which I, like, won.

35:26.920 --> 35:29.631
Peter's in the quarters.
Did you hear?

35:29.714 --> 35:33.176
Wait a second.
Are you screwing him?

35:33.259 --> 35:37.472
- You know what?
- You are, aren't you?

35:37.555 --> 35:39.557
I don't believe this.
Listen, my friend, we don't want...

35:39.641 --> 35:43.353
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you,
grandpa, ranked, like, 120?

35:43.394 --> 35:46.147
I thought all those things they said about you were
just rumors, but you really are a cheap little...

35:46.231 --> 35:47.815
Oh!

35:47.899 --> 35:51.194
Jesus! That really hurts.
But you did it so well.

35:51.277 --> 35:53.530
Are you all right, sir? I'm
fine. I'm fine. Good night, Jake.

35:53.571 --> 35:56.866
Hey, yes, don't get up.
Leave me alone.! I'm fine.!

35:56.908 --> 35:59.536
That's the first time I've ever
hit anybody in my whole life.

36:10.255 --> 36:12.257
Lizzie?
Lizzie!

36:12.340 --> 36:14.425
Other side. Other...

36:22.016 --> 36:25.728
I've never had anyone
fight for my honor before.

36:25.770 --> 36:28.189
I kinda like it.

36:30.900 --> 36:34.737
Jesus Christ! You're not safe to be with.
Wait till you see me drive.

36:59.137 --> 37:01.556
So, these are
the wild streets of my youth.

37:01.639 --> 37:05.852
The drugs, the sex, the milk shakes.

37:05.935 --> 37:08.188
My parents live here,
and I still keep a flat.

37:08.271 --> 37:10.607
Oh, so we can
stay there tonight.

37:10.690 --> 37:14.402
Yeah. But what about your dad?
Aw, let him find his own place.

37:17.071 --> 37:20.492
Parents are such a responsibility.
I know. They're worse than children.

37:20.575 --> 37:22.494
Oh, definitely.

37:22.577 --> 37:25.288
My parents got divorced
when I was 13.

37:25.371 --> 37:28.124
My mom was always on the road
trying to be a singer.

37:28.166 --> 37:31.628
What went wrong?
She couldn't sing.

37:31.711 --> 37:33.963
So mainly my dad brought me up.

37:34.005 --> 37:36.382
Mine are still together.

37:36.466 --> 37:39.594
Which proves that love's not
just blind, it's bloody stupid.

37:40.595 --> 37:42.514
It's sad.

37:42.597 --> 37:45.850
Everything they used to love in each other
now seems to drive them crazy.

37:48.102 --> 37:51.314
I can't imagine
ever wanting to get married.

37:51.356 --> 37:54.108
No. No.

37:54.192 --> 37:57.278
I mean, that's why
we love the tour, isn't it?

37:57.362 --> 38:01.366
There's always another country,
another airport.

38:01.449 --> 38:03.451
Another girl.
That's right, Leslie.

38:03.535 --> 38:04.994
Lizzie. I meant Lizzie.

38:05.036 --> 38:07.288
Ow, ow. I meant... You said
"Leslie. " Who's Leslie?

38:14.045 --> 38:19.175
As you can see, we've, uh, we've had to fire
the builders due to creative differences.

38:19.259 --> 38:22.846
And truthfully, Peter's had
a little bit of a liquidity problem.

38:22.887 --> 38:25.849
Oh, my nan liked to
drink. Sherry. Right.

38:25.890 --> 38:28.142
Piccy?
Just a bitty.

38:28.226 --> 38:31.354
- Carl, what are you doing?
- Uh, Pete. Hi.

38:31.437 --> 38:35.400
Um, wasn't expecting to see you.
And... Shit! That's Lizzie Bradbury.

38:35.441 --> 38:37.861
Can I take a picture?
No, you bloody can't.

38:37.944 --> 38:40.196
- It's digital.
- Look what I found. Oh, hello.

38:40.238 --> 38:42.198
Give me that.
Who are you?

38:42.240 --> 38:44.242
Oh, I only got four pizzas.

38:44.325 --> 38:46.703
Oh, for God's sake!
Right. That's it. Get out.

38:46.786 --> 38:48.746
Come on.
You too, sunshine.

38:48.788 --> 38:51.207
Bugger! I had it on "Landscape.
" Stop it. It's not funny.

38:51.249 --> 38:53.543
I'm sorry.
Move it.!

38:53.626 --> 38:56.379
Change of venue, girls.
Children out! Come on.

38:56.462 --> 38:58.840
- Big fan.
- Come on.

38:58.923 --> 39:00.842
Leave.

39:00.925 --> 39:02.844
I am so sorry.

39:02.927 --> 39:05.221
Might wanna
change the sheets.

39:54.312 --> 39:57.482
Hi, Daddy. It's me.

39:57.565 --> 40:01.694
I know you're probably going nuts
and wanna kill me.

40:01.778 --> 40:03.696
But everything's cool.
Really.

40:03.780 --> 40:08.368
Um, it's hard to explain,

40:08.451 --> 40:11.079
but I really needed to do this.

40:11.162 --> 40:15.083
And... I gotta go. I'll... I'll
see you at practice in the morning.

40:16.501 --> 40:19.921
- Everything all right?
- Everything's great.

40:20.004 --> 40:22.507
Aren't we gonna have a workout?

40:22.590 --> 40:24.676
I thought we just had one.

40:25.927 --> 40:29.639
Now, are you sure about this?
I usually do 10 miles.

40:29.681 --> 40:33.935
- Why are you running behind me?
- I'm just enjoying the view.

40:34.018 --> 40:36.271
Snip by snip

40:36.354 --> 40:39.649
I'm oozin'it bit by bit
Yeah

40:39.691 --> 40:42.068
I'm takin'it step-by-step

40:42.152 --> 40:45.613
Boy, here and now

40:45.697 --> 40:48.867
We're caught in a moment

40:48.950 --> 40:52.537
And I won't let it go

41:05.884 --> 41:10.805
And the silence
It belongs to you and I

41:12.015 --> 41:13.975
Hey, look at that.

41:39.209 --> 41:41.836
This is where my dad taught
me to play tennis. Huh.

41:44.172 --> 41:46.883
Look at it now.
It's a shame.

41:46.925 --> 41:48.885
Yeah.

41:59.604 --> 42:03.066
Ace!

42:03.149 --> 42:06.778
Come on. Make a little effort.

42:15.286 --> 42:17.080
Ace!

42:19.040 --> 42:22.544
What's the matter with you?
Are you scared of a girl?

42:24.379 --> 42:27.799
- There's something I haven't told you.
- What?

42:29.801 --> 42:33.972
This is my last tournament,
no matter what happens.

42:34.055 --> 42:37.016
But you're doing so great.

42:38.726 --> 42:41.563
- Hey, you just have to...
- Keep winning.

42:41.646 --> 42:44.941
Right. So keep winning.

42:51.823 --> 42:54.117
Oh, finally.

42:54.200 --> 42:57.787
Colt returns with a somewhat demure
crosscourt forehand.

42:58.830 --> 43:03.126
Ah.! Colt makes a smashing return.

43:03.209 --> 43:05.336
With unladylike effort,

43:05.420 --> 43:07.755
Bradbury strains
to get to the ball.

43:07.839 --> 43:10.842
Oh.! It's an extremely high lob.

43:10.925 --> 43:13.136
Will he maintain
his gentlemanly composure,

43:13.219 --> 43:16.764
or will he... dare I say...
win the point?

43:18.016 --> 43:20.351
Hold on.
What's happened to the ball?

43:22.187 --> 43:24.314
Look.

44:03.394 --> 44:06.314
Gotta go. Good-bye. Hundred quid
on Cavendish in the quarters.

44:06.397 --> 44:08.316
Hold your horses.

44:08.399 --> 44:10.527
So, still bettin'
against your brother, are ya?

44:10.610 --> 44:14.364
It's tactical. If he loses, I get rich.
And if he wins, I get laid.

44:14.405 --> 44:16.366
Where the heck did you get
a hundred quid anyway?

44:16.407 --> 44:19.160
Photojournalism.

44:29.420 --> 44:33.716
I trust you slept well after your
night of debauchery with young master.

44:33.758 --> 44:35.885
I declare, I surely did.

44:35.927 --> 44:38.429
Good. So did I.
God.

44:38.513 --> 44:41.224
No wonder the English
never win Wimbledon.

44:43.184 --> 44:46.354
I'd love to see an English guy
in the finals, but give me a break.

44:46.437 --> 44:50.024
Peter Colt is the luckiest
man in tennis. Oh. Wanker.

44:54.779 --> 44:57.282
God, it's incredible how much
that actually looks like your dad.

44:59.492 --> 45:02.120
Oh, shit. Incredible
how much that building...

45:04.038 --> 45:05.373
Shit!
Shit!

45:08.126 --> 45:11.754
Quick.! Hide.!

45:11.796 --> 45:14.090
Oh, Carl! You bastard!

45:21.806 --> 45:24.350
Oh, hello. Mr. Bradbury.
Where's my daughter?

45:24.434 --> 45:26.644
She... Gone, sadly.
Sadly, gone.

45:26.728 --> 45:28.646
She had to go and work
on that first serve.

45:28.730 --> 45:30.648
I expect she meant to meet you
at the practice courts.

45:30.732 --> 45:32.650
Are you bullshitting me?
Absolutely not.

45:32.734 --> 45:35.570
I'd never bullshit you.
I wouldn't dream of it.

45:35.653 --> 45:39.949
So, how was your trip down? The traffic
can be murder getting out of London.

45:39.991 --> 45:42.660
We left early. Well, the
early bird does catch the worm.

45:42.744 --> 45:45.622
Uh, wou-would you like
a cup of, uh, tea?

45:45.705 --> 45:48.249
Maybe something stronger.
A shot of whiskey.

45:48.333 --> 45:50.376
A shot at me.

45:50.460 --> 45:52.962
It's Peter, right?
Yeah.

45:53.046 --> 45:55.381
Look, Peter, I got nothing
against you personally.

45:55.465 --> 45:58.760
- You seem like a nice guy, and, uh...
- Oh, good.

45:58.843 --> 46:02.680
I'm not an idiot. I know that
Lizzie likes to... have her fun.

46:02.764 --> 46:06.476
And it keeps her relaxed. Um,
if you were just another easy...

46:07.852 --> 46:10.772
You know. Well, that would be one
thing. But you're not, are you?

46:10.855 --> 46:13.191
As a matter of fact, I was
incredibly easy. No, no.

46:13.274 --> 46:16.986
This time, it's different.
She's... falling for you.

46:17.028 --> 46:20.490
- Oh, I see.
- Which is a total disaster.

46:20.532 --> 46:22.492
But why?
She's hardly lost a set. I...

46:22.534 --> 46:25.203
Look, her footwork is off.
Her serve is a mess.

46:25.286 --> 46:27.288
She's gotta get her head
back in the game.

46:27.372 --> 46:29.874
She's gotta remember
what it is that she wants.

46:29.958 --> 46:32.669
And what do you think that is?

46:32.752 --> 46:34.754
What we've been working towards
all these years,

46:34.838 --> 46:38.550
what she's always wanted
more than anything.

46:38.633 --> 46:42.136
- I still want it.
- Oh. Hi.

46:42.220 --> 46:44.222
I want to win Wimbledon.

46:47.183 --> 46:50.436
I'm sorry.
That's all right, sweetheart.

46:51.437 --> 46:53.690
Well, we'd better get going.
We got a lot of work to do.

46:53.731 --> 46:57.569
- You're gonna go?
- Yeah. He's right.

46:57.652 --> 47:00.697
I'm sorry.
Wait a second.

47:00.780 --> 47:04.701
Lizzie?

47:04.784 --> 47:07.871
Lizzie.!
Lizzie, this is ridiculous.

47:07.954 --> 47:11.374
You're a grown woman, and you should be
making your own decisions. This is my decision.

47:11.416 --> 47:13.376
We can be together
after the tournament.

47:13.418 --> 47:15.253
After the tournament?
What does that mean?

47:15.336 --> 47:17.630
You can't just switch me on and off
like a bloody lightbulb.

47:17.714 --> 47:20.049
I'll call you at the hotel.
She won't be at the hotel.

47:20.133 --> 47:23.052
What?
I'm sorry, kid, but...

47:23.094 --> 47:25.805
If you're together,
she can't play.

47:31.102 --> 47:33.396
- Tom.! Tom.! Tom.!
Well, this may be an all-British affair,

47:33.438 --> 47:37.066
but Tom Cavendish is clearly in control
of the crowd and the match today.

47:37.108 --> 47:42.739
He's up a break in the first set, and Peter Colt...
with the expectations of an entire nation upon him...

47:42.822 --> 47:44.866
seems to be withering
under the pressure.

47:44.949 --> 47:47.160
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet please.

48:01.508 --> 48:04.427
40-love.

48:04.511 --> 48:07.472
So that's set point
for Tom Cavendish.

48:13.978 --> 48:16.773
Linda, to the patio door.
Well, talk to Sergei.

48:16.815 --> 48:19.359
She hits short,
you come in.

48:19.442 --> 48:21.444
Daddy, stop bugging me.
She'll never pass you.

48:21.528 --> 48:24.989
I'm focused.
I know the game plan.

48:25.073 --> 48:26.991
Yeah, right.

48:28.368 --> 48:30.787
He's out of my head now.
It's over.

48:30.870 --> 48:33.623
Stop freaking out on me.

48:33.665 --> 48:37.627
Oh, yeah.
It was definitely his ankle.

48:37.669 --> 48:40.922
You can see how he landed right on it.
This is ugly.

48:41.005 --> 48:44.801
Cavendish.! Cavendish.! Cavendish.!

48:44.843 --> 48:48.304
Peter Colt may havejust
got himself a free pass to the semis.

48:48.346 --> 48:50.932
Think you can go on?

48:58.022 --> 49:00.150
Not so fast, Chrissy.

49:03.027 --> 49:06.656
Listen to the crowd.
They worship the kid here.

49:06.698 --> 49:11.035
The question is, will Colt be able
to take advantage of Tom Cavendish?

49:11.119 --> 49:13.705
He's never shown
much of a killer instinct.

49:13.788 --> 49:15.790
Quiet, please.

49:20.170 --> 49:22.630
- 40-love.
There's your answer, John.

49:24.132 --> 49:26.759
Look at that smile.
Watch out, Tom Cavendish.

49:28.553 --> 49:31.264
Can we take another route?
Her match is at 3:00.

49:31.347 --> 49:33.308
I doubt it. It's a chocker.

49:40.398 --> 49:42.192
What's the score, sweetheart?

49:42.275 --> 49:44.068
It's match point.

49:50.575 --> 49:53.953
Game point. He's done it.!
Peter Colt has done it again.!

49:54.037 --> 49:57.457
Another upset.
Another seeded player goes down,

49:57.540 --> 50:03.087
and Colt will now take on fifth seed
Pierre Maroux in the semifinals on Friday.

50:04.380 --> 50:08.009
Congratulations, my friend. Thank
you, but I think my countrymen hate me.

50:08.092 --> 50:10.553
What? I've just destroyed their
best hopes of winning a championship.

50:10.637 --> 50:14.307
Oh, ridiculous. Everyone loves a
winner. Everybody but the British.

50:16.726 --> 50:18.645
Thank you.

50:18.728 --> 50:21.397
See, I was right. Everything's
good. Everybody loves you.

50:21.439 --> 50:23.233
Almost everybody.

50:33.535 --> 50:36.037
30-all.

50:41.709 --> 50:44.420
What do you think
makes her so extraordinary?

50:44.462 --> 50:48.758
No embarrassment, no fear. She makes a
decision, she goes for it, all pistons firing.

50:48.800 --> 50:52.846
It's a turn-on for the rest of us 'cause most of
the time, let's face it, we're all scared shitless.

50:52.929 --> 50:56.766
Even you, Ron?
Me? I hate making a decision.

50:56.808 --> 50:59.435
Like right now,
I'm very, very afraid.

50:59.519 --> 51:03.731
If you don't see that girl again, it's going to
mess with your head, screw up your confidence.

51:03.815 --> 51:07.861
On the other hand, I'm terrified... I'm petrified
that if I tell you where that girl is camped out,

51:07.944 --> 51:11.239
her father's gonna fire my ass.
Where's the girl camped out, Ron?

51:12.240 --> 51:15.034
32 Kensington Place.
First-floor apartment.

51:16.661 --> 51:18.580
I made a decision.

51:18.663 --> 51:23.084
Game... Miss Bradbury.
Miss Bradbury wins final set.

51:23.168 --> 51:25.420
Me too.

51:40.685 --> 51:43.146
Oh, shh. Shh.
No. No. Hi.

51:43.188 --> 51:44.981
Shh.

51:45.064 --> 51:49.027
- Now, listen. It's not
what you think, so don't start...

51:49.110 --> 51:53.615
I'll jump. I'll jump. I will.
You want that on you conscience?

51:53.698 --> 51:56.534
Thank you.

51:59.954 --> 52:02.665
Lizzie? Lizzie?

52:02.707 --> 52:04.417
Lizzie, it's me.

52:05.877 --> 52:08.463
Shit!

52:17.055 --> 52:19.766
Hey! Shut up!

52:21.226 --> 52:23.394
Noisy little shit.

52:25.605 --> 52:28.066
Oh...

52:30.026 --> 52:31.945
That hurt.

52:34.906 --> 52:37.116
Bugger!

52:37.200 --> 52:40.328
- Peter.
- Yeah.

52:40.411 --> 52:43.873
- What are you doing here?
- That's an excellent question.

52:45.250 --> 52:50.171
That sad fact of the matter is, I can't
seem to get through 24 hours without you.

52:51.923 --> 52:55.510
I missed you, Peter
Peter Colt. You have?

52:55.593 --> 52:58.054
But I need you to go.
No, you need me to stay.

52:58.096 --> 53:01.182
Peter.
Lizzie.

53:02.433 --> 53:04.352
People have fallen in love
before, you know.

53:04.435 --> 53:07.981
Oh. Is that what
we're doing here?

53:15.488 --> 53:17.532
Good thing you didn't
get the wrong room.

53:17.615 --> 53:20.535
I did, but your dad's
a very quick shag.

53:39.262 --> 53:40.972
Good morning.!
BBC London 94.9.

53:41.055 --> 53:43.850
The lark's on the wing
and everything's for the best...

53:43.933 --> 53:47.270
in this best of all possible worlds,
'cause it's semifinals day.

53:47.312 --> 53:51.566
Which means it can only get better as Peter
Colt stares down the racket of Pierre Maroux.

54:15.131 --> 54:17.050
Game point.

54:17.133 --> 54:19.844
Whoa.! Peter Colt must have had
his Wheaties this morning.

54:19.928 --> 54:21.846
He's off to a roaring start.

54:21.930 --> 54:24.474
But remember, Chrissy,
the last time these two met...

54:24.557 --> 54:26.601
was in '97 U.S. Open semis,

54:26.684 --> 54:29.729
a day I'm certain Peter Colt
wants to wipe from the memory banks.

54:29.813 --> 54:32.732
No kiddin'. It was the greatest
opportunity of Colt's career.

54:32.816 --> 54:35.276
He was up two sets,
and then he completely choked.

54:35.360 --> 54:37.779
And I don't think he's ever
fully recovered from it.

54:37.862 --> 54:42.033
You know, John, choking can be
instigated by the smallest thing.

54:42.116 --> 54:46.788
Absolutely. You wake up in the
morning, and something just isn't right.

54:46.871 --> 54:49.624
Or maybe a little superstition
you have goes wrong.

54:50.834 --> 54:53.378
And a seed of self-doubt is planted.

54:53.461 --> 54:55.964
Lizzie.! I love you.!

54:56.047 --> 55:00.385
Then everywhere you look, that feeling of
doubt seems to be looking right back at you.

55:00.468 --> 55:03.972
Once that happens,
all it takes is one point.

55:05.181 --> 55:09.143
One decisive point that
can make or break your confidence...

55:09.185 --> 55:11.813
and completely determine
the outcome of a match.

55:30.081 --> 55:33.001
- Game... Miss Rupesindhe.
- Advantage... Colt.

55:36.004 --> 55:38.631
Well, there's no trophy here today
on number two court.

55:38.715 --> 55:41.676
Peter Colt
is firmly in control.

55:41.759 --> 55:44.095
Thank you.
And incredibly, just two points away...

55:44.179 --> 55:47.807
from the Wimbledon final on Sunday
against America's Jake Hammond.

55:50.518 --> 55:53.188
Come on, Pete.!
Quiet please.

56:10.455 --> 56:13.750
- That was an almost impossible passing shot. Match point.
- Yes!

56:13.791 --> 56:19.005
And he seems to be having trouble getting
up from that awkward tumble just now.

56:19.088 --> 56:21.341
Peter Colt's clearly in pain.

56:21.424 --> 56:24.385
- Shit.
- It's hard to tell.

56:24.469 --> 56:27.138
This could spell disaster for the man
who's captured the hearts...

56:27.222 --> 56:30.725
Come on, Son. Come on. Come on.
Pick yourself up. You can do it.

56:30.808 --> 56:33.186
Mr. Colt, are you okay?

56:33.269 --> 56:35.939
It's my back.
Can you get up?

56:35.980 --> 56:37.941
I'm not entirely sure.

56:37.982 --> 56:42.320
One more point. Come on.
He can't actually hear you.

56:42.403 --> 56:46.491
- Oh, yes, he can.
- This is an eerie echo of the Tom Cavendish match.

56:46.574 --> 56:49.577
- Well, he's back on his feet.
- Oh, yes, he can.

56:50.745 --> 56:55.208
- Well, only he knows how much it's hurting him.
- Oh, my God! The stress.

56:56.292 --> 56:58.336
How does he deal with it?

57:00.797 --> 57:02.715
How does who deal with it?

57:36.040 --> 57:38.293
Oh, my back!

57:38.334 --> 57:40.795
My back is killing me.

57:40.879 --> 57:42.797
But remember you're one point
away from the finals.

57:42.881 --> 57:46.259
I'd love to see an English guy
in the finals, but give me a break.

57:46.342 --> 57:50.513
Do you remember Australia? Your shoulder
was killing you, and what did you do then?

57:50.597 --> 57:54.726
All right. All right. All right!
Peter Colt is the luckiest man in tennis.

57:54.809 --> 57:56.728
This is gonna hurt.

58:00.023 --> 58:02.317
Game, set, match... Colt.

58:02.358 --> 58:07.197
Colt wins three sets to
love:: 6- 2, 6-1, 6-3. Yes!

58:07.238 --> 58:11.034
I knew he could do it.

58:11.117 --> 58:15.079
Who would have bet, two weeks ago,
that the man time had forgotten,

58:15.163 --> 58:19.584
Rabbit. Caught it
messing with your lettuce.

58:20.585 --> 58:22.545
Good man.

58:23.588 --> 58:27.175
Congratulations, Peter. Can we just
do a quickie? No, not right now.

58:29.677 --> 58:33.932
How'd she do? It's just one of those
days where I couldn't do anything wrong,

58:34.015 --> 58:35.683
and Lizzie just couldn't
do anything right.

58:35.767 --> 58:40.605
That would include accepting defeat,
which Ms. Bradbury found very difficult today.

58:40.688 --> 58:44.317
Bugger. It's not as if
she can blame you, is it?

58:46.069 --> 58:49.447
I told you I needed to focus, to be
away from you for just a few days.

58:49.531 --> 58:53.952
But, no, instead you sneak into my room, you
don't even have the decency to spend the night...

58:54.035 --> 58:58.248
- I had the earliest start, and I thought you'd want the extra sleep.
- I was some chick you picked up.

58:58.289 --> 59:01.376
- Well, this chick is going back home
to work on her serve.

59:01.459 --> 59:04.754
Lizzie, I am sorry about your match.
I really am. But please don't go.

59:04.796 --> 59:06.840
Because you need
to screw me before the finals.

59:06.923 --> 59:08.842
That's why you think I'm here?

59:08.925 --> 59:11.970
It's not. Really, Peter?
Not even just a little bit?

59:13.054 --> 59:15.723
Aha.! You see?
I know you want me to think...

59:15.807 --> 59:17.851
that we're falling in love
or some bullshit,

59:17.934 --> 59:20.520
but the only thing you
fell in love with this week was winning.

59:20.603 --> 59:23.273
- That is absolutely not true.
- Oh, yes, it is.

59:23.314 --> 59:26.818
And you know what? I love winning too.
More than anything. More than anyone.

59:28.695 --> 59:31.239
- Don't say that. You don't mean it.
- I do.

59:31.322 --> 59:35.410
Love means nothing in tennis.
Zero. It only means you lose.

59:47.422 --> 59:50.049
She's dropping her arm
too soon after the toss.

59:55.471 --> 59:57.473
Honestly

59:59.017 --> 01:00:03.938
Can I say what I mean

01:00:04.022 --> 01:00:06.733
Don't you play with me

01:00:08.568 --> 01:00:12.489
'Cause I'm a lady

01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:16.659
You must clear your head. You must forget
about her. Love is shit, just like she said.

01:00:16.743 --> 01:00:21.331
Yeah. He's absolutely right. Just ask my
soon-to-be ex-wife. Ask all my ex-wives.

01:00:21.414 --> 01:00:24.876
Thanks for the words of wisdom, Ron.
Shouldn't you be off sucking up toJake?

01:00:24.959 --> 01:00:26.878
I took care of that
at breakfast.

01:00:26.961 --> 01:00:31.257
You gave her a taste ofher medicine. You're in the
finals. It's time to move on, same as she would.

01:00:31.341 --> 01:00:33.009
I don't want to move...
Feel that?

01:00:33.051 --> 01:00:36.221
Ow! I'll take that as a yes.
Look, I'm not making any promises,

01:00:36.304 --> 01:00:40.308
but if you keep relatively still, you
should be in a decent state for the finals.

01:00:40.391 --> 01:00:42.936
Yes.! We got it. Frito-Lay.

01:00:43.019 --> 01:00:46.189
- What? - You are the new
spokesperson for their brand-new chip.

01:00:46.272 --> 01:00:48.900
Surprisingly Zesty, it's called.
That's you, pal.

01:00:48.983 --> 01:00:53.988
- Oh, God. I've gotta get out of here.
- No. No way. You heard the good doctor. Let's get you some room service.

01:00:54.072 --> 01:00:59.035
I would kill for another dozen of those... what do
you call the... those little cucumber sandwiches?

01:00:59.077 --> 01:01:02.330
- Cucumber sandwiches.
- You Brits got a name for everything, huh?

01:01:02.413 --> 01:01:06.209
And in other news, the kuiper
belt comet Armstrong-Flynn...

01:01:06.251 --> 01:01:09.963
finally disappeared from view today
after blazing for nearly a...

01:01:10.046 --> 01:01:12.465
There's a distance between us

01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:14.717
And you take the blame

01:01:14.759 --> 01:01:18.972
I know that you tried
but at this stage of the game

01:01:19.055 --> 01:01:21.766
I've started a new life

01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:23.768
There's no turning back

01:01:23.852 --> 01:01:26.855
Why, Jennifer? Will
you now Don't you know

01:01:26.896 --> 01:01:29.315
Can't you see
I get over

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.527
Sometimes I wonder

01:01:34.154 --> 01:01:37.490
Where this feeling began

01:01:39.492 --> 01:01:45.415
Deep in my heart
right from the start

01:01:45.498 --> 01:01:48.751
Right from the start

01:01:48.793 --> 01:01:52.672
Tired and lonely

01:01:52.755 --> 01:01:56.259
I move on from this pain

01:01:57.927 --> 01:02:00.346
I'm starting again

01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:04.684
I'm breakin'the chain

01:02:07.437 --> 01:02:09.355
Yeah, all right. I'm going.

01:02:11.149 --> 01:02:13.985
I'm going.

01:02:26.206 --> 01:02:28.500
Oh, for God's sake, Carl.

01:02:31.628 --> 01:02:33.588
Carl!

01:02:35.798 --> 01:02:37.884
For God's sake, what...

01:02:37.967 --> 01:02:41.304
Didn't I tell you always to knock
before entering a room?

01:02:41.346 --> 01:02:45.517
Well, it's a bit late now. You better come
in and have some breakfast. What do you want?

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.061
Eggs and soldiers?

01:02:48.144 --> 01:02:51.105
- Oh, eggs will be fine.
- Sit down.

01:02:53.399 --> 01:02:55.485
Morning, Son.
Where's the marmalade?

01:03:11.751 --> 01:03:14.128
Well, uh,
I'm out of the tree house.

01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:16.673
Yeah, you certainly are.

01:03:16.714 --> 01:03:20.593
Your mother and I seem to have found
some common ground at long last.

01:03:20.677 --> 01:03:24.389
- Oh, really. What's that?
- You, Peter.

01:03:28.434 --> 01:03:33.648
You're, uh, probably aware that things
have been a bit sticky for the last few,

01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:35.650
well, years actually.

01:03:35.692 --> 01:03:37.694
The fact is that, uh,

01:03:37.735 --> 01:03:41.990
in the end, the only thing we shared was the
downstairs toilet, and she wasn't really keen on that.

01:03:48.413 --> 01:03:51.624
I think what I'm trying to say is that...

01:03:51.708 --> 01:03:55.378
we'd forgotten just what
an inspiration you are to both of us.

01:03:56.796 --> 01:04:00.842
That's meant to be
the other way around actually, I know.

01:04:00.925 --> 01:04:03.011
But how very proud we are of you.

01:04:11.352 --> 01:04:13.646
It's been a long time since
we've done this.

01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:15.648
Too bloody long.

01:04:16.649 --> 01:04:19.194
Dad?
Hmm?

01:04:19.235 --> 01:04:21.988
My back.
Oh, God.

01:04:23.448 --> 01:04:26.659
Well, it's been quite
a fortnight, hasn't it?

01:04:26.743 --> 01:04:29.454
Not just for Peter,
but for all of us.

01:04:29.537 --> 01:04:33.625
I, for one, will admit...
and that's not a word I like very much.

01:04:35.585 --> 01:04:38.046
But we could all do better...

01:04:38.087 --> 01:04:43.259
to love and support
each other unconditionally.

01:04:43.301 --> 01:04:45.470
Without judgment, without...

01:04:45.553 --> 01:04:49.224
- For God's sake, Carl, stop biting your fingernails. You're not a bloody infant!
- Augusta!

01:04:50.809 --> 01:04:54.604
- You were saying, darling?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

01:04:54.646 --> 01:04:59.776
I just wanted to propose a toast.
To the family. Our family.

01:04:59.818 --> 01:05:01.653
It's a trick.
Our family.

01:05:01.736 --> 01:05:03.571
Our family.

01:05:09.077 --> 01:05:13.081
Oh, bloody marvelous.
No, darling. We're bad luck.

01:05:13.122 --> 01:05:16.417
If we came and you lost, I would
never be able to forgive myself.

01:05:16.501 --> 01:05:19.128
I don't believe in luck anymore.

01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:22.882
Listen, win or lose,

01:05:22.966 --> 01:05:26.177
and I can't see how
I'm possibly going to win,

01:05:27.262 --> 01:05:29.973
tomorrow will be my last
professional tennis match.

01:05:31.307 --> 01:05:34.644
And I can't imagine the three of you
not being there. So, please.

01:05:36.604 --> 01:05:40.483
So what you're saying is
Jake's the safe bet then.

01:05:40.984 --> 01:05:43.778
Good morning. It's Radio 1
at 7:00. I'm Chris Moyles.

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:46.239
So today's the day.
It's the big finals.

01:05:46.322 --> 01:05:49.075
Peter Colt, what an amazing man.
Who would have thought?

01:05:49.159 --> 01:05:51.870
I didn't think he was gonna do it.
Now, I'm starting to think...

01:05:51.953 --> 01:05:56.749
Morning, everyone. BBC London 94.9.
And it's here. It is Wimbledon finals day.

01:05:56.833 --> 01:05:59.878
I'll try to be detached,
I try to be cool, but I'm carried away.

01:05:59.961 --> 01:06:02.338
Come on, Colty.!

01:06:06.509 --> 01:06:08.511
Good luck, Mr. Colt.

01:06:08.595 --> 01:06:11.806
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:06:19.022 --> 01:06:20.773
All the best, Mr. Colt.

01:06:20.857 --> 01:06:24.152
Thank you.
Thanks very much.

01:06:32.368 --> 01:06:34.287
Thank you.

01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:37.582
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:06:37.665 --> 01:06:39.626
Thanks.

01:06:41.044 --> 01:06:42.962
Thank you.

01:06:43.046 --> 01:06:45.590
Thank you very much.

01:06:45.673 --> 01:06:49.135
An Englishman in the final.
Fantastic!

01:06:49.219 --> 01:06:52.138
If you could win that cup, sir,
we'd all be so proud.

01:06:52.222 --> 01:06:54.182
I'll do my best.

01:06:55.225 --> 01:06:57.143
And I don't even like tennis.

01:07:05.193 --> 01:07:07.195
Ready, sir?

01:07:07.278 --> 01:07:09.864
Yeah, I think I am.

01:07:09.906 --> 01:07:12.742
Peter Colt, seen here in his teens,

01:07:12.784 --> 01:07:15.036
has already declared this to be
his last competitive match.

01:07:15.078 --> 01:07:18.206
And what an exit.
Only a matter of days ago,

01:07:18.289 --> 01:07:22.544
Colt had become no more than a fading
blip on the radar of tennis history.

01:07:22.585 --> 01:07:24.546
Now he's become the man who...

01:07:31.928 --> 01:07:37.684
Not to add the pressure, Peter, but you know the
entire United Kingdom is cheering you on today.

01:07:37.767 --> 01:07:41.771
Yes. Well, let's hope
I don't disappoint them.

01:07:41.855 --> 01:07:46.276
Did you have any realistic hope two weeks ago that
you would be here today preparing to walk onto...

01:07:46.359 --> 01:07:51.906
Lizzie, I love you more than life itself, but I can't turn
off every goddamned television set in the United Kingdom.

01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:53.950
I'm going for a walk.

01:07:54.951 --> 01:07:57.412
Flight board's in half an hour.

01:08:02.792 --> 01:08:05.253
What do you attribute this
remarkable run to?

01:08:05.295 --> 01:08:07.922
You were supposed
to make a very early exit.

01:08:07.964 --> 01:08:13.261
Well, I had a bit of luck against Tom Cavendish in
the quarters, and I played a more focused game...

01:08:15.847 --> 01:08:18.140
passionate game, uh...

01:08:19.142 --> 01:08:23.270
I suppose the real answer
to your question is, uh,

01:08:23.313 --> 01:08:25.814
well, love really.

01:08:25.857 --> 01:08:28.568
Love of the game?

01:08:28.651 --> 01:08:30.778
Yeah, love of the game. Um...

01:08:32.363 --> 01:08:35.492
But, listen, you may have read about
Lizzie Bradbury and myself...

01:08:35.575 --> 01:08:39.412
being involved, so to speak.

01:08:39.496 --> 01:08:44.082
But, um, I'd like to take this opportunity
to set the record straight.

01:08:44.167 --> 01:08:47.587
I read the papers this morning,
and, uh, they seem to imply...

01:08:47.670 --> 01:08:50.548
that Lizzie had let me down
in some way.

01:08:50.631 --> 01:08:52.926
That's just not the case.

01:08:53.009 --> 01:08:55.845
The truth is I let her down.

01:08:57.596 --> 01:09:01.768
I let her down, and for that...

01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:03.895
I'll always be truly sorry.

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:21.328
Listen, I'm not in the habit...

01:09:21.371 --> 01:09:23.540
of pouring my heart out
on television.

01:09:23.622 --> 01:09:26.626
I'm not really in the habit
of pouring my heart out at all.

01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:30.630
Lizzie, sweetheart, something
I think you ought to see.

01:09:30.712 --> 01:09:33.341
I'm seeing it. So if this
comes out wrong, forgive me.

01:09:33.383 --> 01:09:36.301
Lizzie Bradbury.

01:09:36.386 --> 01:09:38.304
Lizzie is the reason that I'm here today.

01:09:43.475 --> 01:09:46.895
That's all I really came here
to say except thank you.

01:09:49.858 --> 01:09:51.776
Thank you, Peter.

01:10:00.076 --> 01:10:04.247
I, uh, have a new theory
of our life of tennis.

01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:07.417
Tell me.
Oh, it's simple really.

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:10.044
You hit the ball
back over the net...

01:10:10.128 --> 01:10:13.548
as hard and as deep...

01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:16.843
and as often
as possible.

01:10:16.926 --> 01:10:19.429
Sorry to disturb you, Peter.

01:10:19.512 --> 01:10:24.225
The members have invited you to use
the number one dressing room.

01:10:24.267 --> 01:10:28.897
Oh, no. Thank you, Danny.
I think I'd rather stay here.

01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:32.775
Right. That's what
I told 'em you'd say.

01:10:46.372 --> 01:10:48.291
Good luck, my friend.

01:10:58.551 --> 01:11:01.429
In a few minutes, Colt and Hammond
will be making the walk...

01:11:01.471 --> 01:11:03.807
through the tunnel
onto center court.

01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:08.645
A little stroll, Chrissy, that I'm sure you'd agree is
about the number one highlight of a tennis player's career.

01:11:08.686 --> 01:11:12.315
Except for the butterflies
I always felt, absolutely.

01:11:12.398 --> 01:11:14.776
No, he can't just wear the hat.

01:11:14.818 --> 01:11:17.487
No, we don't 'cause we don't have
an endorsement deal. That's why.

01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:19.989
Well, then he knows the number.

01:11:27.956 --> 01:11:29.874
Peter.

01:11:45.723 --> 01:11:47.809
I tried to warn you about her.

01:11:50.353 --> 01:11:52.147
By the way,
how's the weak back?

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:57.360
It's fine. Thanks.

01:11:57.443 --> 01:11:59.737
How's the weak mind?

01:11:59.821 --> 01:12:01.573
Gentlemen.

01:12:15.753 --> 01:12:17.714
Fuck a duck.

01:12:33.396 --> 01:12:35.440
Jake Hammond has been
on an absolute tear.

01:12:35.523 --> 01:12:38.526
He's lost only one set
this entire tournament.

01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:40.987
And look who he's had to beat.
Hewitt, Federer.

01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:44.240
Well, with the exception
of Dragomir and Tom Cavendish,

01:12:44.282 --> 01:12:46.951
Colt's road to this final
has been a relative pushover.

01:12:47.035 --> 01:12:49.037
Right. But he's played
some great tennis.

01:12:49.078 --> 01:12:53.041
But my guess here is that he's more
than a little overmatched today.

01:12:54.626 --> 01:12:57.629
First set. Hammond to serve.

01:13:03.927 --> 01:13:06.429
I gotta go.

01:13:06.471 --> 01:13:10.350
Peter! Peter! Peter!

01:13:11.768 --> 01:13:13.770
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet please.

01:13:15.313 --> 01:13:17.524
Ready.

01:13:18.775 --> 01:13:20.985
Play.

01:13:26.574 --> 01:13:30.078
15-love.

01:13:32.956 --> 01:13:34.874
Yes, thanks.
I'll be needing that.

01:13:36.751 --> 01:13:39.379
He said, "Thanks.
I'll be needing that. "

01:13:43.424 --> 01:13:46.928
- Quiet please.
- Go, Jake! Come on, Jake.

01:13:52.267 --> 01:13:54.352
30-love.

01:14:02.944 --> 01:14:05.613
40-love.
Oh, that poor kid.!

01:14:05.655 --> 01:14:10.076
He was on the receiving end of one of the
fastest-recorded serves in professional tennis.

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.495
144 miles per hour.

01:14:12.537 --> 01:14:15.123
Well, we certainly
hope he's all right.

01:14:15.165 --> 01:14:17.834
And that reminds me
how lucky I was, Chrissy.

01:14:17.876 --> 01:14:21.254
I ball-boy'd in the old days
when they used wood rackets.

01:14:21.337 --> 01:14:23.882
And things were a lot slower.

01:14:27.051 --> 01:14:30.638
Oh, you bastard.
It's one thing to humiliate me,

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:32.849
but you didn't have to mess
with the boy.

01:14:32.932 --> 01:14:34.976
Now you're going down,
you bastard.

01:14:39.564 --> 01:14:42.317
- Or maybe not.
- Colt to serve.

01:14:44.402 --> 01:14:46.362
Love-15.

01:14:46.446 --> 01:14:48.490
Love-40.

01:14:48.531 --> 01:14:50.033
Game... Hammond.

01:14:50.074 --> 01:14:51.534
40-love.

01:14:51.618 --> 01:14:54.162
Game and this set...
Hammond.

01:14:54.204 --> 01:14:55.371
30-love.

01:14:55.455 --> 01:14:58.249
Game... Hammond.
New balls, please.

01:14:59.959 --> 01:15:01.211
Love-15.

01:15:02.378 --> 01:15:05.715
Hammond leads five games to two.

01:15:05.757 --> 01:15:07.050
Game... Hammond.

01:15:07.133 --> 01:15:08.635
Love-30.

01:15:08.718 --> 01:15:10.553
15-30.

01:15:16.893 --> 01:15:19.771
15-40.

01:15:19.854 --> 01:15:23.149
Peter Colt finds himself
once again at break point.

01:15:25.401 --> 01:15:29.906
He really can't afford to go down
another break this early in the third set.

01:15:29.989 --> 01:15:32.534
He seems completely lost
out there, John.

01:15:32.575 --> 01:15:35.578
Lost and confused.
We may be witnessing...

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:38.248
the near total collapse
of a player's game.

01:15:38.331 --> 01:15:40.750
At a moment like this, Chrissy,
you have to wonder...

01:15:40.834 --> 01:15:43.878
what the hell is going through
Peter Colt's mind.

01:15:45.588 --> 01:15:48.800
Please, God.
Please make it end.

01:16:10.655 --> 01:16:13.992
Game... Hammond. Play suspended.

01:16:24.961 --> 01:16:28.423
What are you doing, lad?
Get in here.

01:16:38.725 --> 01:16:40.768
It ain't over
till the handshake, lad.

01:16:40.852 --> 01:16:43.938
Danny, I'm not really in the mood
for a pep talk right now.

01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:45.940
Well, you better
get ready for one.

01:16:51.362 --> 01:16:53.907
Hi.

01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:56.242
I thought you'd gone.

01:16:56.326 --> 01:16:59.704
Yeah. Me too.

01:17:01.664 --> 01:17:03.625
Having a tough day?

01:17:05.877 --> 01:17:08.546
Well, you know, disastrous.

01:17:11.132 --> 01:17:14.344
Except for the fact that you didn't
go gooey when the ball boy got hit.

01:17:14.385 --> 01:17:17.430
Yeah. Sorry.

01:17:17.514 --> 01:17:20.391
Why are you British
apologizing all the time?

01:17:20.475 --> 01:17:22.477
Don't apologize to me.
I love you.

01:17:22.519 --> 01:17:25.688
Apologize to the people who are rooting
for you out there. What'd you say?

01:17:25.772 --> 01:17:29.526
I said that the whole country has
been waiting... No. No. The other bit.

01:17:30.985 --> 01:17:32.904
I said I love you.

01:17:39.035 --> 01:17:41.287
See, that's very good news.

01:17:41.371 --> 01:17:43.706
I thought I was alone
in the love department.

01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:46.334
Well, turns out
you've got company.

01:17:48.503 --> 01:17:50.505
I am so sorry.

01:17:50.588 --> 01:17:53.633
If you say sorry one more time,
you're going to be sorry.

01:17:53.716 --> 01:17:55.802
I meant about the other night.
Shh! Stop it.

01:17:55.885 --> 01:17:58.471
Forget about that.

01:17:58.555 --> 01:18:00.473
This is about you.

01:18:00.557 --> 01:18:04.644
Go out there and decide
who you are.

01:18:06.187 --> 01:18:09.274
And who might that be?
That might be a winner.

01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:14.070
Please be patient, Mr. Hammond.
Please sit down.

01:18:14.112 --> 01:18:16.865
The question is, where's Peter Colt?

01:18:16.906 --> 01:18:18.908
Did he flee the building
with the rain?

01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:22.036
I think he's in the lavatory.
Isn't that a comfort break?

01:18:22.078 --> 01:18:24.038
Is it?
Yes. They are allowed one.

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:26.040
If he's got a jumpy tummy.

01:18:27.167 --> 01:18:30.712
So, if he doesn't come back...

01:18:30.753 --> 01:18:32.714
He's gonna lose.

01:18:32.755 --> 01:18:35.758
Of course I want to win. I do.

01:18:35.842 --> 01:18:38.386
But he's just better than me.
No. He's not.

01:18:40.555 --> 01:18:44.225
I'm two sets down. My back's killing me.
You're going to play through the pain.

01:18:44.267 --> 01:18:46.269
I'm too tired.
My legs are like lead.

01:18:46.311 --> 01:18:49.063
Find a second wind. It's what
winners do. His serve is unstoppable.

01:18:49.105 --> 01:18:51.232
No, it's not.
It's a bundle of tells.

01:18:52.942 --> 01:18:55.445
- What?
- His serve.

01:18:55.487 --> 01:18:58.656
It's like a book. You just
have to know how to read it.

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:01.826
You know I really don't care who wins.
I mean, I represent both players.

01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:04.954
It's like asking me
which one of my kids I love more.

01:19:05.038 --> 01:19:07.665
Which one of my kids
do I love more?

01:19:07.749 --> 01:19:09.667
My daughter.
I'll talk to you later.

01:19:13.379 --> 01:19:16.090
Well, Peter Colt is back.
Let's hope he's better.

01:19:16.132 --> 01:19:18.176
So far this match
has been a blowout.

01:19:18.259 --> 01:19:21.054
Yeah, Pete! Peter!

01:19:26.893 --> 01:19:30.271
Ladies and gentlemen,
as play resumes, Hammond leads...

01:19:30.313 --> 01:19:32.899
two sets to love
and one game to love.

01:19:34.651 --> 01:19:36.986
Hammond to serve. Play.

01:19:48.456 --> 01:19:50.250
Go, Pete.!

01:19:51.417 --> 01:19:54.462
Ifhe bounces the ball once
instead of twice,

01:19:54.546 --> 01:19:57.257
he's going for the body.

01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:00.552
Ifhe shifts back on his left heel
and shows you his toe,

01:20:00.635 --> 01:20:02.554
it means he's hitting deep.

01:20:07.559 --> 01:20:10.311
Colt sure seemed to have Hammond's
number on that one, Chrissy.

01:20:10.353 --> 01:20:15.191
Which is a good sign ifhe's gonna climb
out of the giant hole he's dug himself.

01:20:15.275 --> 01:20:17.777
Ouch. You all right?
Yeah.

01:20:17.861 --> 01:20:19.821
Welcome back.
Same to you, sir.

01:20:20.864 --> 01:20:24.284
Station ident ready to roll.

01:20:24.367 --> 01:20:28.496
Eight, top of your shot.
We got a visitor.

01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:30.915
John, did you see who just came in?

01:20:30.999 --> 01:20:34.627
That'll give an immediate
adrenaline burst.

01:20:39.257 --> 01:20:42.343
- Yes!
- He did it, Chrissy. He pulled out the set.

01:20:53.396 --> 01:20:55.607
Oh!

01:20:56.774 --> 01:20:58.610
Yes!

01:21:09.078 --> 01:21:12.540
After a great comeback in the third set,
Colt's game has leveled.

01:21:12.582 --> 01:21:15.543
And he and Jake Hammond
are even at 5-all in this tie-break.

01:21:15.585 --> 01:21:18.213
So, John, this next point
is crucial...

01:21:18.296 --> 01:21:20.590
if Colt wants to keep this
comeback alive. Come on, Peter!

01:21:20.632 --> 01:21:24.177
Okay. 5-5 in the breaker.
Here we go.

01:21:37.899 --> 01:21:40.401
6- 5... Hammond.

01:21:40.443 --> 01:21:43.279
Jake Hammond is up 6-5
in the tie-breaker,

01:21:43.363 --> 01:21:46.533
and he's finally gotten himself
a championship point.

01:21:46.616 --> 01:21:50.078
This could be the final point
of Peter Colt's pro career.

01:21:50.161 --> 01:21:52.747
Right here, right now.

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:58.294
- Ladies and gentlemen, quiet please.
- This could be it, Chrissy.

01:21:59.337 --> 01:22:01.631
I- If his heel moves left,
he's going right.

01:22:01.673 --> 01:22:04.217
Or is it the toss? Yes.
I- I-If he tosses high, i-it...

01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:06.261
Oh, sod it!

01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:23.611
- 6-all.
- Incredible point.

01:22:23.653 --> 01:22:25.780
I'm doin'a complete 180
on Peter Colt.

01:22:25.822 --> 01:22:29.117
This is amazing persistence
from thejourneyman player.

01:22:29.159 --> 01:22:31.786
I was already thinking
about gettin'to the airport.

01:22:34.122 --> 01:22:36.624
We may be going to a fifth set,
and if I was Jake Hammond,

01:22:36.666 --> 01:22:38.668
I'd want to close
this thing out right now.

01:22:38.751 --> 01:22:42.797
The last thing he wants is another set with
the momentum going in the other direction.

01:22:44.174 --> 01:22:46.217
Okay. First one to win by two.

01:22:49.012 --> 01:22:51.973
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet please.

01:23:08.490 --> 01:23:10.783
7- 6... Colt.

01:23:10.867 --> 01:23:12.952
Wow. A double fault.

01:23:13.036 --> 01:23:15.497
Now it looks like Hammond's
the one who's getting tight.

01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:19.125
Peter Colt now has set point
to force a fifth and deciding set.

01:23:33.223 --> 01:23:36.851
Aw, give us a goddamn break!

01:23:36.893 --> 01:23:40.522
Please, shut off
all mobile phones. Thank you.

01:23:43.942 --> 01:23:46.236
Yeah.

01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:13.138
Unbelievable.!
We're gonna play five.!

01:24:17.934 --> 01:24:21.354
Advantage... Colt. Rising star
Peter Colt has battled back.

01:24:25.233 --> 01:24:27.318
Game... Colt.

01:24:36.286 --> 01:24:38.204
Peter Colt-san.

01:24:47.922 --> 01:24:51.426
Game point.
Colt leads five games to four.

01:24:51.468 --> 01:24:53.428
Final set.

01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:56.681
Well, Colt has broken Jake Hammond.
And after this changeover,

01:24:56.764 --> 01:24:58.725
he's gonna be serving
for the Wimbledon title.

01:24:58.808 --> 01:25:02.353
Listen, an hour ago, I didn't think he'd
find anybody to give him a ride home.

01:25:02.437 --> 01:25:04.856
No question, John.
And now it's all up to him.

01:25:04.939 --> 01:25:08.401
I mean, he's finally got a chance
to serve out the match.

01:25:13.573 --> 01:25:15.492
Time.

01:25:17.952 --> 01:25:19.871
Break you right back, asshole.

01:25:19.954 --> 01:25:22.123
Did you see that?

01:25:22.165 --> 01:25:24.876
That is some definite gamesmanship
from Jake Hammond.

01:25:30.715 --> 01:25:33.051
Come on, Peter.

01:25:44.145 --> 01:25:46.523
15-love.

01:25:48.316 --> 01:25:50.235
Come on!

01:25:51.361 --> 01:25:54.489
Peter Colt is now three points away
from winning Wimbledon.

01:25:57.867 --> 01:25:59.869
One point at a time, Peter.

01:25:59.953 --> 01:26:04.207
One point at a time. It's just
another point. It's just another point.

01:26:04.249 --> 01:26:07.001
Like hell it is. You could be
the champion of Wimbledon,

01:26:07.043 --> 01:26:09.838
which means you wouldn't have to
take the pro job for starters.

01:26:09.879 --> 01:26:13.007
You could buy a new place, redecorate.
Lizzie could help with that.

01:26:13.091 --> 01:26:15.718
Oh, God knows
what taste she has.

01:26:15.802 --> 01:26:17.720
Oh, shut up, you silly ponce.

01:26:27.856 --> 01:26:29.566
30-love.

01:26:29.607 --> 01:26:32.068
Make that two points away, Chrissy.

01:26:40.785 --> 01:26:44.539
- Come on, Peter.!
- Ladies and gentlemen, quiet please.

01:26:44.581 --> 01:26:46.541
Oh, my God.

01:26:46.583 --> 01:26:50.044
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:26:55.383 --> 01:26:56.759
Come on, Pete.

01:27:07.604 --> 01:27:09.564
30-15.

01:27:11.232 --> 01:27:14.527
Chrissy, we talked about
Colt's reputation in the past...

01:27:14.611 --> 01:27:17.238
as a choker when
it comes to big points.

01:27:17.322 --> 01:27:19.282
Well, this is primo choke time.

01:27:19.324 --> 01:27:22.494
I wouldn't be surprised
if Colt got real tight now.

01:27:22.577 --> 01:27:24.829
Thank you.
It's my fault.

01:27:24.913 --> 01:27:28.166
Peter.! Peter.! Peter.!

01:27:30.001 --> 01:27:32.837
Don't choke. Don't choke.
Don't choke. Don't choke.

01:27:32.921 --> 01:27:35.381
Please don't choke.
Please don't choke. Don't choke.

01:27:36.758 --> 01:27:38.676
I'm not gonna choke, damn it.

01:27:44.974 --> 01:27:47.310
40-15.

01:27:50.814 --> 01:27:53.733
Peter.!

01:27:54.818 --> 01:27:59.072
Do you believe it? Peter Colt
is serving a championship point.

01:28:00.323 --> 01:28:02.659
Quiet please.

01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:05.995
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet please.

01:28:07.288 --> 01:28:09.249
Championship point.

01:28:10.333 --> 01:28:12.418
Right then.

01:28:21.219 --> 01:28:22.512
- Out.
- 40-30.

01:28:22.554 --> 01:28:25.932
- I don't believe it. That was a terrible call for Colt.
- No!

01:28:26.015 --> 01:28:28.101
- What the hell?
- What?

01:28:28.184 --> 01:28:31.521
- Look at the chalk fly.
The ball was definitely in.

01:28:31.563 --> 01:28:34.607
- It was on the line.
- It was on the line!

01:28:34.691 --> 01:28:37.068
I'd be torching
the stadium about now.

01:28:38.153 --> 01:28:40.238
Excuse me!
The ball was good.

01:28:40.321 --> 01:28:43.533
40-30. Oh, come on. The
ball was good. Chalk flew up.

01:28:43.575 --> 01:28:47.745
The whole stadium saw it. I don't know if you've
noticed, but it's quite an important point.

01:28:47.829 --> 01:28:51.040
That's too close for me to overrule.
Please resume play.

01:28:51.082 --> 01:28:53.459
Absolutely not. I'm not playing.
This is complete bollocks.

01:28:53.543 --> 01:28:56.963
- Absolutely bollocks.
- Code violation.

01:28:57.046 --> 01:29:00.175
Unsportsmanlike conduct.
Warning, Mr. Colt.

01:29:00.216 --> 01:29:02.719
- In.! In.! In.!
- Oh, my...

01:29:05.889 --> 01:29:07.891
Okay, here we go.

01:29:07.932 --> 01:29:12.187
Peter Colt has his second chance now
to win the championship.

01:29:12.228 --> 01:29:14.856
The question is, can he do it?
After a call like that...

01:29:14.939 --> 01:29:17.358
a lot of players,
including yours truly,

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:20.069
would have a hard time
getting back in the mind-set.

01:29:20.153 --> 01:29:23.072
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet please.

01:29:34.459 --> 01:29:37.045
That serve wasn't even close.

01:29:37.128 --> 01:29:39.714
It wasn't fast either.

01:29:39.798 --> 01:29:42.342
I believe you
to be a truly great tennis player.

01:29:42.425 --> 01:29:45.804
- Ultimately disappointing.
Total collapse of a player's...

01:29:45.887 --> 01:29:49.140
Stop it. You have to stop it.

01:29:49.224 --> 01:29:51.351
Now.

01:30:42.110 --> 01:30:43.528
Yes!

01:30:46.823 --> 01:30:48.950
He's done it.! He has done it.!

01:30:49.033 --> 01:30:53.788
Thejourneyman has won.! A wild card
entry. Ranked 119th in the world.

01:30:53.830 --> 01:30:56.499
Now champion of Wimbledon.!

01:31:11.055 --> 01:31:14.642
Call Letterman. Call Leno.
Call Oprah. Call Kimmel.

01:31:18.855 --> 01:31:20.815
It's utter pandemonium here.

01:31:20.857 --> 01:31:23.776
I've never seen anything
like this in my life.

01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:25.862
The Brits finally have a winner.

01:31:25.945 --> 01:31:29.574
What's wrong with you? You bet
on Jake? I bet it all on you, bro!

01:31:31.659 --> 01:31:34.037
Can I retire now, Mum!
Certainly not!

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:37.207
Augusta!
Well done, Son. We love you.

01:31:39.876 --> 01:31:43.129
He seems to be lookin'
for somebody else.

01:31:43.213 --> 01:31:46.633
I think the whole world
knows who he's lookin'for.

01:31:56.392 --> 01:31:58.895
There's so much
I want to say to you.

01:31:58.978 --> 01:32:02.148
I'm not going anywhere.
Oh, yes, you are.

01:32:02.232 --> 01:32:04.150
You're going a long, long way.

01:32:10.114 --> 01:32:13.368
Nothing could possibly
match that moment.

01:32:13.409 --> 01:32:16.079
It's everything you wait
a lifetime for.

01:32:16.162 --> 01:32:19.541
That dream finally come true.

01:32:19.582 --> 01:32:21.543
What else could ever come close?

01:32:22.544 --> 01:32:24.462
Except this, maybe.

01:32:24.546 --> 01:32:28.800
I did take a job at a club. But teaching
young kids like my own, not old ladies.

01:32:28.883 --> 01:32:30.885
Yeah!
And I love it.

01:32:30.927 --> 01:32:33.805
I beat you. I beat you. Rubbish. The
ball was in. It was definite... Ow!

01:32:33.888 --> 01:32:35.807
Well, most of the time.

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:42.147
You see, a part of me was always afraid that my
life would be over if I wasn't playing tennis.

01:32:42.230 --> 01:32:44.774
But the truth is, it was
reallyjust beginning.

01:32:46.609 --> 01:32:49.112
Oh, and by the way,
Lizzie did win the U.S. Open.

01:32:49.195 --> 01:32:51.698
And Wimbledon.

01:32:52.323 --> 01:32:53.700
Twice.

01:33:02.917 --> 01:33:06.588

01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:08.840
