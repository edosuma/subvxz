WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:02.711
Jobs go to who's qualified, man.

00:02.794 --> 00:04.295
-You're--
-(clamoring)

00:04.379 --> 00:06.548
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:06.631 --> 00:09.300
I need the Diablo leader to be a man.

00:09.384 --> 00:11.344
Big talk for a kid, Nesto.

00:11.428 --> 00:15.724
They came in to pay back the Blood
about 20 Diablos in four cars.

00:15.807 --> 00:18.018
Diablos go for a payback
without you in front?

00:18.101 --> 00:21.521
-I laid down my colors.
-I don't buy it that you're out as leader.

00:21.604 --> 00:24.399
Hey, did you ever kiss a guy, Mike?
Like a man?

00:24.482 --> 00:26.568
(laughs) On the lips?

00:28.069 --> 00:30.989
(gunfire)

00:31.072 --> 00:33.658
We got a gang hit.
Five bodies, one of them Marcus Peabody.

00:34.117 --> 00:36.202
I'm a cop, you dirtball.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.580
Mikey...

00:40.457 --> 00:43.001
Great, Jimmy. You just killed us.

00:43.543 --> 00:44.961
First of all,
I never thought I'd see the day

00:45.045 --> 00:47.047
that Andy Renko would tie the knot.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.924
And you still ain't seen that day,
Joe Coffey.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.801
What you are seeing is the day before.

00:51.885 --> 00:55.055
-What do you really want?
-I need for us to be separate.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.766
Then I guess that's what we'll have to do.

00:57.849 --> 01:01.186
I wish I could think of some awful clichÃ©
that'd somehow be comforting.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.271
How about the oldest one in the book?

01:03.897 --> 01:05.398
"Your ex-wife still loves you."

01:09.986 --> 01:12.614
-(all chattering)
-LUCY: Item three, sex in the locker room!

01:14.783 --> 01:17.118
Thank you.
Now, would you please stay like this?

01:17.911 --> 01:18.787
Item four.

01:20.622 --> 01:24.334
Pearl Harbor for the Blood last night,
courtesy of Lester Franco and associates.

01:24.417 --> 01:27.170
Dead are Marcus Peabody
and four of his lieutenants.

01:27.253 --> 01:30.799
Item five. Obviously, Mick Belker's
operation Straight Flush

01:30.882 --> 01:34.511
concluded with the arrests of Franco,
James Lastarza, and Joseph Desoto.

01:34.594 --> 01:37.305
They'll be arraigned this morning
on multiple homicides.

01:37.388 --> 01:40.225
This leaves the Blood
without much of their own leadership left.

01:40.308 --> 01:41.935
The junior varsity Blood
that we picked up yesterday

01:42.018 --> 01:45.313
is gonna be released this morning
maybe or maybe not in time for the summit

01:45.396 --> 01:47.899
that Captain Furillo has called
at 10:00 a.m. this morning.

01:47.982 --> 01:51.986
Six, Lieutenant Hunter's taking
a personal holiday today.

01:52.570 --> 01:55.448
I guess that horse
that he bought got sick.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.992
-OFFICER 1: Aww!
-(laughter)

01:58.076 --> 01:59.744
It's not funny, a horse getting sick.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.872
-A dead horse is not funny. Sick is funny.
-(laughter)

02:03.164 --> 02:06.417
Anyway, uh,
Ballantine takes over the EATers.

02:06.501 --> 02:10.505
Seven, a new computer unit
showed up yesterday,

02:11.548 --> 02:14.843
so it looks like we're gonna have
this thing for about a three-week trial.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.762
And everybody is gonna get a shot
at driving the unit.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.306
And today,
we got Hill and Renko, you got it.

02:20.390 --> 02:23.143
OFFICER 2: Oh, Renko.
Don't mess it up, okay?

02:23.226 --> 02:29.107
Uh, item eight, of which Officer Renko's
repeated trips upstairs is a reminder,

02:29.190 --> 02:30.650
there's a wedding tonight, Andy.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.485
(all cheering, applauding)

02:32.569 --> 02:35.321
We got a wedding
between Andrew Jackson Renko

02:35.405 --> 02:37.949
and Daryl Ann McConnicke
tonight, 7:00 p.m.

02:38.032 --> 02:41.119
Don't forget, everybody.
First Avenue Methodist.

02:41.786 --> 02:45.331
And Leo's got maps. Don't get lost.

02:45.415 --> 02:48.376
And the reception follows
right afterwards at the Kubiak, okay?

02:48.459 --> 02:51.796
-Hey, Sarge. Renko's gift?
-Oh, yeah, the gift.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.591
Uh... everybody knows about
the bedroom set, right?

02:54.674 --> 02:58.595
Let me see. It's a seasoned-walnut king
with a headboard

02:58.678 --> 03:01.848
and matching night stands.
And everybody knows that we got a deal

03:02.390 --> 03:05.602
because we got it
from Joe's cousin's furniture store.

03:05.685 --> 03:06.603
(laughter)

03:06.686 --> 03:10.773
And I know that everybody
gave what they felt they could afford,

03:10.857 --> 03:13.568
but I gotta tell you,
we are short 106 bucks.

03:14.152 --> 03:17.739
Now, Joe has got to pick up the furniture
at four o'clock this afternoon,

03:17.822 --> 03:21.075
so anybody that can,
you gotta go back in your pocket.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.786
Bobby's gonna be upstairs
with a collection plate.

03:23.870 --> 03:24.996
-Please.
-OFFICER 3: Yeah.

03:25.330 --> 03:28.833
Okay, let's roll, let's be generous,
and let's be careful out there.

03:28.917 --> 03:32.670
(clamoring)

03:33.046 --> 03:35.131
Hey, Mick, Mick. Uh... this is for you.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.388
-Sixty cents?
-That's all I got.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.351
Hey, Joe. Joe, how about a--

03:46.434 --> 03:49.187
Hey. Hey, Bobby, I got us the deal.
Doesn't that mean anything?

03:49.270 --> 03:51.481
-WOMAN: Phone call, Joe Coffey.
-Excuse me.

03:51.564 --> 03:54.192
-I'll be outside, Joe.
-Rudy! Hey, Rudy, old brother.

03:54.275 --> 03:55.610
I know you're good for a couple of bucks.

03:55.693 --> 03:58.696
Bobby, I already put in my ten.
Besides, I hardly even know the guy.

04:01.532 --> 04:03.159
Captain. Hey, Captain.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.913
How about putting in a little bit
for Andy's wedding?

04:06.996 --> 04:08.081
We're short a couple bucks.

04:08.164 --> 04:11.376
Gee, Bobby, uh, all I can afford
is a couple of bucks.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.378
No problem.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.756
I've had some unexpected expenses lately.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.594
(telephone ringing)

04:21.678 --> 04:24.347
Yeah? I just got in. Yeah.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.476
(telephone ringing)

04:43.157 --> 04:44.033
Hi.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.870
I just want you to know
I accept your apology.

04:49.247 --> 04:52.834
-What apology?
-For making that pass at me yesterday.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.128
I mean, as far as
I'm concerned, it's history.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.046
Not another word,
and I won't press charges.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.464
Oh, that's a relief.

04:58.548 --> 05:02.302
-Are you sure you're not angry with me?
-Scout's honor.

05:02.385 --> 05:05.680
'Cause I really am sorry.
Not for the feelings.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.600
But I'd hate myself if you thought
I was taking advantage of the situation.

05:09.684 --> 05:13.479
Oh, Fay, you don't have to apologize.
You made me feel wanted.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.732
That's the best feeling
I've had in a long time.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.026
(soft chuckle)

05:18.818 --> 05:21.154
(clicks tongue) Try not to maul me.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.575
I have just one more thing
I want to say to you,

05:25.658 --> 05:26.659
then I'm out of here.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.163
I love you, mister.

05:30.788 --> 05:33.624
I always have, and I always will,
no strings attached.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.086
I wish for you
nothing but happiness, always.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.673
Promise me you know that.

05:42.050 --> 05:42.884
I do.

05:47.930 --> 05:51.976
-Never say "I do" to a single woman.
-(laughs)

05:52.685 --> 05:54.020
It's nice to see you laugh.

05:59.275 --> 06:01.235
You're the best ex-wife I've ever had.

06:04.489 --> 06:08.117
-So far.
-(both laugh)

06:10.078 --> 06:12.538
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

06:12.622 --> 06:14.332
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

06:14.415 --> 06:18.294
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:18.378 --> 06:20.088
(sirens wailing)

06:25.468 --> 06:29.263
(theme music playing)

07:42.753 --> 07:44.046
LUCY: Forget about it, Joe.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.632
Don't you think it's some kind of omen?

07:46.716 --> 07:48.509
He's calls when we're short
for Andy's present?

07:48.593 --> 07:50.761
-No.
-Well, I disagree.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.346
Hey, plus, if you knew my uncle,

07:52.430 --> 07:53.514
you'd know he wouldn't even
pick up the phone

07:53.598 --> 07:55.224
if he wasn't positive
the horse was gonna win.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.561
Hey. We can't risk Andy's bedroom set
on some Florida horse race, Joe.

07:59.187 --> 08:02.190
Hey, this way we could get him
a whole apartment full of furniture.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.902
-What if the horse loses?
-Then he sleeps on the floor.

08:05.985 --> 08:09.489
I'm gonna sign this now.
You fill in what we're short at the store.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.824
This is going for the furniture,
right, Joe?

08:11.908 --> 08:14.535
-You guys got no imagination.
-Who do I make it out to?

08:15.244 --> 08:16.537
Julius' Sleepworld.

08:18.372 --> 08:21.083
Beauty part is I took advantage
of their two-for-one offer,

08:21.167 --> 08:23.336
-so it cost you nada.
-I don't know, Harry.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.713
Lieutenant, you talk for two minutes
on a videotape,

08:25.796 --> 08:28.591
and then a bunch of women
call you for dates. What can be bad?

08:28.674 --> 08:31.177
What kind of a woman calls
a complete stranger?

08:31.260 --> 08:34.388
Ah, no problem. You screen them
before the service releases your number,

08:34.472 --> 08:36.682
-so it eliminates the beasts.
-That seems pretty cold.

08:36.766 --> 08:39.894
Oh, as opposed to the deep human warmth
of your average singles bar?

08:40.686 --> 08:43.773
Uh, look. What time you down for?

08:43.856 --> 08:45.816
Ten-thirty.
Just if we're cool around here.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.903
(sighs) Okay. Maybe, if we're cool.

08:48.986 --> 08:51.239
All right. You're never gonna
regret this, Lieutenant.

08:51.614 --> 08:52.448
Hi.

08:54.825 --> 08:55.660
Hi.

08:55.993 --> 08:57.787
Are we going to Andy Renko's
wedding tonight?

08:57.870 --> 08:59.038
-Do you want to?
-Sure.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.415
Good. I'll pick you up at the apartment.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.709
Do you have a case now?

09:03.793 --> 09:06.420
Mm-hmm. I was pulling
arrest reports for my fill-in.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.798
I'm going on vacation tomorrow.
Twelve days.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.884
-Oh. Where?
-Paris.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.345
The travel agent got me on.

09:14.929 --> 09:17.181
I didn't think
they renewed passports this fast.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.018
-We were going to Paris one day.
-I know.

09:28.025 --> 09:30.528
Well, there's no guarantee
we would've made it anyway.

09:30.611 --> 09:32.071
And this is no guarantee we won't.

09:32.154 --> 09:35.700
Frank, I've been promising myself Paris
and the Louvre since I was in college,

09:35.783 --> 09:37.034
since I was a little girl.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.870
I needed one of the somedays to be now.

09:40.204 --> 09:43.666
I understand. I do. Pick you up a 6:00.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.335
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.504
And I want to save our marriage.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.715
I don't know if you can believe it,
but I'm trying to.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.383
See you later.

09:58.556 --> 10:01.350
Yo, Furillo. Do I look like a cop to you?

10:02.768 --> 10:04.729
Nobody's asking you to be a cop, Jesus.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.106
Job's gang consultant.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.108
Doing the cop's business.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.444
I thought you were out
as leader of the Diablos.

10:11.527 --> 10:12.570
I thought you were looking for something.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.530
You're right. A million dollars.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.032
Seventy-five dollars a day,

10:16.115 --> 10:18.534
if the Department of Social Services
accepts you.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.495
We get the treaties
I think you can help me get,

10:21.579 --> 10:24.332
there could be a regular slot for you
in the mayor's youth program.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.627
Ross Phillips,
Department of Social Services.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.879
Is this our applicant?

10:29.962 --> 10:31.756
Ross Phillips, Jesus Martinez.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.718
Uh, Jesus, here,
has been expressing some doubts.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.178
Uh, just as well.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.764
I did my background reading
in the car, Mr. Martinez.

10:40.348 --> 10:44.185
We've got some real problems with you
in terms of our ideal job description.

10:44.810 --> 10:47.021
See, Frankie? This is why.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.607
You're a recent partisan
of one of the warring factions,

10:49.690 --> 10:52.151
a convicted felon still on parole,
a reputed hothead--

10:52.234 --> 10:53.778
Just get lost, okay, man?

10:54.904 --> 10:57.198
In short, you're everything
my department doesn't need

10:57.281 --> 10:59.992
after the illustrious Mr. Marcus Peabody,
if we ever did.

11:00.076 --> 11:03.954
I'm gonna tell you something,
since I didn't want the damn thing anyway.

11:05.081 --> 11:08.542
You need me, bro,
'cause you don't know nothin'!

11:10.127 --> 11:11.962
At least I know how to talk to people.

11:12.046 --> 11:15.132
I don't walk into a place and say,
"They're like Marcus Peabody."

11:16.050 --> 11:17.843
(sighs) Sorry if I offend.

11:19.136 --> 11:21.138
Job robbed me of my tact years ago.

11:21.222 --> 11:24.308
Thank you for shortening my rounds,
Mr. Martinez. Captain.

11:29.105 --> 11:33.109
See, the point is,
if somebody does see the difference,

11:33.192 --> 11:36.362
Marcus Peabody over here means one thing,

11:36.445 --> 11:39.490
Jesus Martinez over there
means another thing.

11:39.573 --> 11:43.577
Then maybe he could do something.
He'll know the scene at least.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.287
If I get you the 75, will you help?

11:47.373 --> 11:49.291
-What do you got there?
-FRANK: I worked up some proposals.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.794
The Blood and the Diablo
would give up two blocks apiece

11:51.877 --> 11:53.003
to the gangs that are still strong.

11:54.296 --> 11:57.717
Forget about Diablos giving anything
to Mau Mau and Dragons.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.720
Maybe they give something to DMZ.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.847
-Will you pitch it?
-Got the 75?

12:03.222 --> 12:04.056
Thanks, Jesus.

12:06.976 --> 12:09.770
So, I'm just, uh,
I'm just real eager to meet you.

12:10.604 --> 12:13.065
I want to share
what's a very exciting time in my life

12:13.149 --> 12:15.109
and share what's exciting in yours.

12:15.860 --> 12:21.115
So, uh, you can help me study,
or you can help me catch crooks,

12:21.824 --> 12:23.284
or maybe just help me unwind.

12:24.493 --> 12:27.246
I don't know what else to tell you.
Call me.

12:28.038 --> 12:29.790
-(chuckles)
-Good. Great.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.293
I want to be a fly on your bedroom wall.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.378
Hey, lighten up.
You look like you're going to the chair.

12:34.462 --> 12:35.379
Let's just do it.

12:36.714 --> 12:39.717
Okay, just hold the slate in front,
Hank, like a convict.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.803
(liquid pouring)

12:44.054 --> 12:45.514
-Is it going?
-Not yet.

12:46.432 --> 12:49.977
And don't shift on your stool. You're on.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.271
-Uh, my name is--
-JERRY: You can put the slate down.

12:55.691 --> 12:59.320
Uh, my name is Henry Goldblume.
I'm doing this 'cause a friend made me.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.866
I'm not very good
at this sort of presentation.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.743
Nevertheless... (clears throat)

13:05.826 --> 13:07.787
I'm divorced, I have...

13:08.078 --> 13:11.290
two wonderful children, five and seven,
who live with their mother.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.709
But I'm-I'm very close with them.

13:15.336 --> 13:19.215
Uh, I'm still very close
with their mother... too,

13:19.298 --> 13:21.383
even though we don't
see each other very much.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.389
Let's see. Hobbies.
I don't really have too many.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.683
My wife used to say I'm a workaholic.
I don't really believe it.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.436
And, I guess, definitely,

13:32.520 --> 13:37.066
I want to meet somebody good, kind, uh...

13:37.817 --> 13:41.612
beautiful, of course, although that-that
really doesn't mean that much to me.

13:42.655 --> 13:46.450
Anyway, I, uh, I want to meet somebody.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.119
I'd like a committed relationship.

13:50.579 --> 13:51.997
I'd very much like to be happy.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.338
-Okay?
-I am if you are.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.131
Can we get out of here?

14:02.341 --> 14:05.928
(siren wailing)

14:10.140 --> 14:12.685
-(tires screeching)
-(man speaking indistinctly on radio)

14:14.186 --> 14:15.145
Did you take the bet?

14:15.396 --> 14:19.191
"Donnybrook," the sixth at Tropical
250 win, 200 place.

14:20.860 --> 14:21.694
Thanks, Lenny.

14:21.777 --> 14:24.029
Hey, hope it comes in.
I went for a fin myself.

14:25.239 --> 14:28.659
(woman speaking indistinctly on radio)

14:37.418 --> 14:39.753
Think maybe we could head back
to our own precinct now?

14:40.170 --> 14:41.005
Yep.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.426
I'm not gonna ask you
what went on back there.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.596
-Right.
-Except I'm gonna tell you.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.598
I used to have this buddy
who booked policy.

14:51.473 --> 14:53.517
He used to say you could play
your number day in and day out,

14:53.601 --> 14:56.061
yet he'd bet you 3-to-1 odds
the day your number came in,

14:56.145 --> 14:57.146
you wouldn't be on it.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.315
What's that supposed to mean, Rudy?

14:59.398 --> 15:02.401
It means that with gambling,
something always goes wrong.

15:02.484 --> 15:03.319
That's what.

15:04.695 --> 15:08.824
Look, I'm taking the shot for Renko.
I don't need your heavy dose of pessimism.

15:09.283 --> 15:12.620
It'd be nice if we could get him
a-a nice nest egg, wouldn't it?

15:13.412 --> 15:14.747
(scoffs) Yeah, right.

15:16.749 --> 15:17.583
Hey, look at that.

15:18.709 --> 15:21.211
Guy sure screwed up
if he's looking for the jailhouse.

15:21.503 --> 15:22.796
JOE: His lights are flashing.

15:23.380 --> 15:24.506
You'd better make a u-ie.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.385
Unit 2203 requesting route and destination

15:28.469 --> 15:32.640
on corrections department vehicle,
license M58372.

15:33.599 --> 15:37.436
WOMAN (over radio): <i>2203,</i>
<i>your M58372 corrections department</i>

15:37.519 --> 15:39.813
<i>is a ferrying vehicle</i>
<i>with prisoners being moved</i>

15:39.897 --> 15:42.816
<i>-to report at Michigan Avenue complex.</i>
-Back off! Back off!

15:42.900 --> 15:43.734
-(gunshot)
-(shatters)

15:45.069 --> 15:46.445
Go!

15:46.528 --> 15:49.114
Unit 2203,
crossfire from a corrections bus.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.032
(siren wailing)

15:50.115 --> 15:51.116
We're in pursuit east...

15:51.200 --> 15:52.785
(indistinct dialogue)

15:53.285 --> 15:55.996
(woman speaking indistinctly on radio)

15:58.290 --> 16:01.460
(sirens wailing)

16:15.891 --> 16:19.979
Yo! We got guns! We got hostages!

16:20.062 --> 16:21.772
Anybody shoots, the guards are dead.

16:21.855 --> 16:25.359
It's Franco. It's the guy Belker popped.
Yeah, we hear ya!

16:25.442 --> 16:28.445
-Nobody goes behind that bus.
-Yeah, we hear ya, Franco.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.281
Any cops go behind that bus,
that's an attack.

16:31.365 --> 16:32.199
The guards get hit.

16:32.282 --> 16:34.034
Hey, nobody's gonna attack, all right?

16:34.368 --> 16:36.620
-(tires screeching)
-Where the hell did they get pieces?

16:36.704 --> 16:40.457
You get somebody down here with weight.
Get some authority here.

16:40.541 --> 16:44.086
They're on their way.
Just don't do anything crazy, Franco.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.880
You just tell them to get here fast,
'cause we got places to go.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.806
My stomach's rumbling.
And I got me an appetite for turf.

16:55.889 --> 16:58.684
-Leave some room at the table, bro.
-(indistinct dialogue)

16:58.767 --> 17:00.144
-LUCY: This way, gentlemen.
-Hey, come on.

17:00.227 --> 17:01.895
Let's move it. Let's move it.
Hey, yo. Harry, let's go, man.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.564
-Captain wants us now.
-What's going on?

17:03.647 --> 17:06.525
Franco and his buddy just commandeered
a corrections vehicle. A bus.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.318
-How?
-Sorry, Lieutenant, don't know.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.653
They got them cornered somewhere
up in the Heights.

17:09.737 --> 17:12.406
Yes. Yes, as long as you need him. Right.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.367
Warren Briscoe wants you on the site
to read personalities.

17:15.451 --> 17:16.368
I'm on my way.

17:16.827 --> 17:19.997
Take three minutes to run Franco's file,
see who might have stashed the bus.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.707
Figure there was someone
who had a loan with them?

17:21.790 --> 17:23.333
Well, whoever put the weapons on the bus

17:23.417 --> 17:24.793
may have worked the rest
of the escape plan.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.378
What we're trying to do here
is find an alternative

17:26.462 --> 17:27.546
-to a frontal assault.
-Okay.

17:27.629 --> 17:29.506
-Captain, you got a full house downstairs.
-Okay, thanks.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.051
Maybe somebody who worked
in corrections at the courthouse.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.136
-You want me in on this summit?
-No, no, no.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.637
Coordinate with the Heights
on the bus hijack.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.599
-Where were you, Henry?
-Uh, I'll explain.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.435
Listen, draw 75 bucks
out of the discretionary fund

17:41.518 --> 17:42.561
for Jesus, okay?

17:43.062 --> 17:46.565
And, uh, could I burn a couple of bucks
walking around with me?

17:46.648 --> 17:49.693
Here. Take a five.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.403
This hotel is breaking me.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.406
FRANK:
Killers of the Blood will be prosecuted.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.575
All Blood arrested
on the playground yesterday

17:56.658 --> 17:59.203
-will be released, for openers.
-(all murmuring)

17:59.286 --> 18:01.580
Who's the assistant pig
in the pen, Furillo?

18:01.663 --> 18:02.498
ALL: Yeah.

18:04.124 --> 18:08.462
-You want to rephrase that, Kearney?
-Hey, I'm a consultant, all right?

18:09.254 --> 18:11.548
If you have something to consult,
you can consult with me.

18:11.632 --> 18:16.595
Going the Marcus Peabody route.
Kickin' out to Diablo's?

18:16.678 --> 18:21.266
Man's no Diablo.
Man lets Diablo's get killed.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.603
Are you talking personal, Felipe?
Are you talking Nesto?

18:25.145 --> 18:26.480
Nesto ain't for here, bro.

18:26.563 --> 18:28.398
-That your pay-off?
-Get him out of here.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.317
-FELIPE: Getting my brother killed?
-(indistinct dialogue)

18:30.400 --> 18:31.235
Slow down, Furillo.

18:31.944 --> 18:32.820
(spits)

18:36.532 --> 18:39.618
As much as you need, Felipe,
you and me, we'll talk.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.454
It's not for here. It's not for here.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.582
It doesn't matter who hates me.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.377
Downtown suit hates me.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.214
Downtown suit walked out
on me half hour ago.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.758
But I can still tell you what I see.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.635
I see 11 guys die.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.513
I see Blood over there.

19:00.180 --> 19:03.851
No offense, bro.
But it's like I'm lookin' at kids.

19:05.352 --> 19:09.148
That makes me sad. Makes me feel old.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.191
You are old. You're finished!

19:11.942 --> 19:16.655
Well, could be, Ramon. Could be.
But I'm still here today.

19:17.364 --> 19:21.201
And you're gonna listen to me
because I'm the one who knows the facts.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.621
Facts is no one wants to die.

19:28.625 --> 19:29.585
Briscoe just called.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.045
-He wants you at the hostage site.
-Why?

19:32.713 --> 19:34.840
Mick's volunteered for a hostage exchange.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.637
Uh, Captain.
Got a possible on who packed the bus.

19:40.721 --> 19:43.140
Service manager at the maintenance garage,
he'd have access.

19:43.223 --> 19:45.350
-What's the hook?
-He likes the ponies.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.186
He's in to Franco for over 12 grand.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.146
-Good enough. Go find him.
-On our way.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.856
Quickly, guys. I'll be at the site.

19:50.939 --> 19:54.193
Henry, uh,
if there's an agreement in principle,

19:54.276 --> 19:56.195
they'll reconvene at 2:00
to set the boundaries.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.779
-Help Ray if I'm not back.
-Sure.

19:58.655 --> 20:03.243
LEO: Lieutenant. Call on five.

20:06.663 --> 20:10.459
-Didn't say.
-Goldblume. Who?

20:13.378 --> 20:15.422
Yeah, I did. I most certainly did.

20:16.590 --> 20:17.758
Oh, you were?

20:17.841 --> 20:19.801
What was it particularly
that impressed you?

20:22.137 --> 20:26.141
Look... you're not just playing a gag
for Harry Garibaldi?

20:26.808 --> 20:27.893
If you're on the level,

20:27.976 --> 20:30.771
I gotta tell you that I was--
I was led to understand

20:30.854 --> 20:33.273
that... my name wouldn't be released.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.444
No. No, as a matter of fact, uh--

20:39.196 --> 20:43.075
Uh, no. No.
No, I guess it wouldn't hurt anything.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.327
Okay. Yeah, I do.

20:46.828 --> 20:47.663
Wait, how am I--

20:50.540 --> 20:53.335
Meet ya? Okay.

20:54.711 --> 20:55.629
Yeah, 12:30.

20:58.715 --> 20:59.675
What was that accent?

21:01.301 --> 21:02.302
I wouldn't know, Leo.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.685
If I were to mention
just a series of gift items

21:09.768 --> 21:13.188
and you were to acknowledge with just
a general facial expression, and, uh--

21:14.106 --> 21:16.316
Renko, I'm not gonna tell you
what we got you.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.526
Fine. Good.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.570
As long as it isn't some
useless ceramic animal

21:20.654 --> 21:23.115
or some giant shard of glass.

21:23.740 --> 21:25.742
Whew! This thing is a wonder.

21:25.826 --> 21:29.246
You know that Buick we just passed?
Lickety-split.

21:29.329 --> 21:35.961
Owner's a Lehman W. Stanley,
4467 Sutton, 57, brown eyes, 5'9,

21:36.044 --> 21:39.923
speeding conviction last November,
and he's deaf in his left ear.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.466
Yeah? Let's bust him.

21:42.009 --> 21:45.304
What I'm saying is, we finally got
ourselves the right tool for the job here.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.682
This extends the law's long arm
another six inches.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.142
(laughs)

21:51.601 --> 21:54.354
-Uh-oh, I know that look.
-Public convenience.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.565
All right,
there's a diner right over here.

21:56.648 --> 21:58.984
Okay. You know,
I hope this marriage lasts,

21:59.067 --> 22:01.194
'cause this one day
is bad enough for any human.

22:01.445 --> 22:04.448
-You want anything from the counter?
-Kaopectate.

22:16.585 --> 22:19.838
(slow piano music playing)

22:29.931 --> 22:32.351
-WOMAN (German accent): Henry Goldblume?
-How do you do?

22:33.518 --> 22:35.228
You were good to come. I'm Eva.

22:37.272 --> 22:38.106
Henry.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.117
This is pretty strange.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.203
-You find it so?
-Yeah, I think I do.

22:51.828 --> 22:52.704
Do you want to have a drink?

22:52.788 --> 22:54.873
(clears throat) Uh, water's great. Thanks.

22:56.583 --> 22:59.711
-Look, can I ask you a question?
-Please.

23:00.212 --> 23:03.632
-Where'd you get my number?
-From Jerry, the cameraman.

23:05.175 --> 23:07.844
So this isn't an official
part of the service?

23:07.928 --> 23:09.262
Very unofficial.

23:10.013 --> 23:13.433
-May I be frank with you, Henry Goldblume?
-Please.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.103
We are adults.

23:16.770 --> 23:20.190
The road to happiness
is not a straight and simple one.

23:21.691 --> 23:24.611
If a certain man comes to make a tape,

23:24.694 --> 23:28.657
if Jerry feels perhaps
I can help this man find happiness,

23:29.741 --> 23:31.284
he and I have an arrangement.

23:32.202 --> 23:35.705
I see. And I'm that kind of man?

23:36.415 --> 23:38.291
Jerry thought perhaps.

23:38.708 --> 23:42.254
You and I will discover.
What are you feeling?

23:43.046 --> 23:45.006
Uh, I'm not sure.

23:45.799 --> 23:48.927
-I suspect this is often.
-What?

23:49.928 --> 23:52.931
You have difficulty
to discover your feelings.

23:53.306 --> 23:57.936
I find it often in men of your profession.
Am I correct, Henry?

23:59.312 --> 24:00.522
I'm interested. Go on.

24:02.691 --> 24:06.278
Shall I help you discover your feelings,
Herr Goldblume?

24:07.446 --> 24:09.072
I'm a very good guide.

24:10.490 --> 24:11.366
Oh, boy.

24:13.952 --> 24:16.997
-Is this a charity service?
-No.

24:18.206 --> 24:22.377
The road we would travel
would be very curved, very difficult.

24:23.128 --> 24:27.799
-And it would be a toll way.
-A toll way? Meaning?

24:28.425 --> 24:33.221
You would pay me certain sums of money.
We would experiment.

24:33.972 --> 24:36.933
Perhaps I would make you
wear certain things...

24:37.350 --> 24:38.977
do certain things...

24:39.936 --> 24:42.856
expose to you your innermost torment.

24:44.357 --> 24:46.359
That's it. You're busted.

24:47.402 --> 24:48.320
Excuse me?

24:48.403 --> 24:50.489
I'm a cop. You're under arrest.

24:51.156 --> 24:55.035
Of course, you are a cop,
but for what are you arresting me?

24:55.118 --> 24:57.162
Soliciting. Come on.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.165
-Oh, you do not wish to do this.
-Save it, Eva.

25:01.124 --> 25:04.503
The bust of course is a hammer.
These are not illegal acts.

25:04.586 --> 25:05.629
We are going in.

25:07.380 --> 25:09.633
RENKO:
I do not know where people get the stones

25:09.716 --> 25:12.177
to charge 50 cents a stall
in a public convenience

25:12.260 --> 25:13.803
-when there ain't no toilet paper.
-(chuckles)

25:13.887 --> 25:15.222
I'm talking about paper towel

25:15.305 --> 25:17.015
with the abrasion factor
of number two sandpaper.

25:17.098 --> 25:20.018
-(laughs) Look at this.
-It's working on me here just like this.

25:20.101 --> 25:23.980
-(gasps) The car!
-Oh, no.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.234
-Oh, no!
-Where's the car?

25:28.485 --> 25:29.528
Oh, no.

25:30.904 --> 25:31.988
Oh, no.

25:33.323 --> 25:36.493
Now, Mike, as I said before,
we need some more cars.

25:36.576 --> 25:38.411
I think we got two out here already.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.956
(indistinct chatter)

25:42.123 --> 25:43.833
Ask him about the guards.
We want to know how the guards are.

25:43.917 --> 25:44.751
All right.

25:49.464 --> 25:51.758
Jimmy, they want to know
how the guards are doing.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.928
Great. Swell.

25:56.346 --> 25:59.808
I want to see my guards at the window.
I want to hear each one of my men talk.

25:59.891 --> 26:01.726
That's not realistic right now, Sergeant.

26:03.853 --> 26:05.939
I've got a man
with a cardiac problem in there.

26:06.147 --> 26:08.275
Damn it, you got to let us
do our work here.

26:08.358 --> 26:11.194
I'm not gonna force a negotiating point
so you can be reassured.

26:11.278 --> 26:12.779
-Do you understand?
-I'm filing.

26:12.862 --> 26:15.240
File your damn grievance.
Just stay out of our way.

26:15.323 --> 26:16.533
Where the hell's that van?

26:16.616 --> 26:18.618
I'm working on the van, Lester!

26:19.911 --> 26:22.789
You know the bureaucracy.
The wheels turn a little slow.

26:22.872 --> 26:25.709
Yeah, Mike,
and the squeaky ones get greased.

26:25.792 --> 26:28.295
-OFFICER 1: Stay away from there!
-Can we make somebody squeak in here?

26:30.088 --> 26:32.465
Mister, we're moving on
everything you asked for.

26:32.549 --> 26:33.800
The van's on its way.

26:33.883 --> 26:36.386
I'm trying to get authorization
for clear passage.

26:36.469 --> 26:40.140
Jimmy, didn't I get you
Mike Belker here as fast as I could, huh?

26:40.223 --> 26:43.810
-Yeah, but you didn't get him on the bus.
-Joe.

26:46.229 --> 26:48.356
-Captain, Rudy and I were--
-Back to the precinct.

26:51.192 --> 26:53.361
Give me 20 seconds, fellas.
I'll get back to you.

26:56.573 --> 26:59.242
Frank, I wouldn't have asked,
but on a volunteer basis,

26:59.326 --> 27:02.287
I'd be willing to consider
letting Belker go on the bus.

27:02.370 --> 27:05.915
Captain, when the exchange is four to one,
one of the guards is sick.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.876
One of the guards is sick...
(muttering)

27:07.959 --> 27:10.211
...numerical equivalency here,
it's a joke.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.171
Warren, look...

27:12.255 --> 27:15.091
I know you want to save fireworks
with the guards association.

27:15.258 --> 27:17.344
Frank, I never said a word.
The man volunteered.

27:17.427 --> 27:19.429
Belker has too much history
with those guys.

27:19.804 --> 27:21.640
You can talk about an exchange
to buy some time,

27:21.723 --> 27:23.183
but he's not going on that bus.

27:23.808 --> 27:27.145
LESTER: You people think I'm kidding?
You think I'm fooling around in here?

27:27.771 --> 27:29.814
No one thinks you're fooling, Lester.

27:30.523 --> 27:32.067
Look, the van just showed.

27:32.150 --> 27:34.486
Doesn't that show you
some good faith on my end?

27:34.569 --> 27:37.197
What are you gonna give me
for the good faith, Lester?

27:37.614 --> 27:39.074
What about safe passage?

27:39.157 --> 27:41.117
We're working on it.
I need some more time.

27:41.201 --> 27:42.535
You think I'm a jerk?

27:42.619 --> 27:44.954
I'm gonna kiss your feet
'cause you show me a van?

27:45.038 --> 27:46.331
Here! Here!

27:46.414 --> 27:48.124
-(gunshots)
-(grunts)

27:51.002 --> 27:52.337
God!

27:54.839 --> 27:56.800
Look at this. Look at this!

27:56.883 --> 27:59.219
There, now you know I'm serious.

27:59.969 --> 28:02.639
Lester Franco, Lester Franco.

28:02.722 --> 28:05.809
He was sick.
He was getting a little blue anyway.

28:05.892 --> 28:08.812
You deal in good faith
and you deliver prompt!

28:08.895 --> 28:11.189
JIMMY: : All right, truce.
Go ahead and pick him up.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.985
I want that van, and I want clear passage.

28:16.069 --> 28:18.947
-(siren wailing)
-And Belker! And Belker!

28:21.116 --> 28:26.079
(siren wailing)

28:26.162 --> 28:30.583
So, Mikey, talk to me.
Tell me what a Judas feels like.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.169
That's not the way I look at it, Jimmy.

28:33.253 --> 28:37.841
I'd like to know how you look at it.
I'd like to know how you feel, Mikey.

28:37.924 --> 28:40.635
I want to know
what it feels like inside you.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.095
You know what I want?

28:42.762 --> 28:47.892
I want those three guards should get off,
and then we can talk about it on the bus.

28:48.685 --> 28:52.063
There's a lot of seats.
Why don't you just come onboard?

28:52.147 --> 28:55.525
No, no. It's got to be an exchange, Jimmy.

28:55.608 --> 28:58.069
Hey, Briscoe,
somebody just went behind the bus!

28:58.153 --> 29:01.990
No one went behind the bus.
The guys went to relieve himself, Lester.

29:02.073 --> 29:03.408
(helicopter blades whirring)

29:03.491 --> 29:06.494
Weapons and tactics estimate
a hostage casualty

29:06.578 --> 29:07.746
in a rescue attempt.

29:07.829 --> 29:09.956
We'll have a better chance
in a surprise environment.

29:10.039 --> 29:12.167
My detectives just took the guy
who packed the bus.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.626
They're gonna sweat him
for the escape route.

29:13.710 --> 29:15.962
While we stall with what?
They've made no comfort requests.

29:16.045 --> 29:18.256
Belker's song and dance
isn't gonna sell much longer.

29:18.339 --> 29:20.759
Safe passage, yes or no?

29:25.764 --> 29:27.390
Yes, Lester. I told you yes.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.517
You asked us to clear
four different routes.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.561
The logistics
are just a little tough, huh?

29:31.644 --> 29:35.565
I got three lives here, Briscoe.
Do I have to take another life?

29:35.648 --> 29:37.108
WARREN:
That's not gonna help anything, Lester.

29:37.192 --> 29:38.985
It won't make anything move any faster.

29:40.111 --> 29:42.155
I heard it on my bearcat, Frank.
Where do we stand?

29:42.238 --> 29:43.698
Judge, just get out of here.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.701
There's nothing I can do?
Offer them some false promises?

29:47.535 --> 29:50.538
Twenty minutes. You got 20 minutes
or I take another life.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.749
What's magic about 20 minutes, Lester?

29:52.832 --> 29:57.587
It's magic for the guy who's gonna croak.
Twenty minutes I'm serious.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.970
Fifteen minutes, prepare to hit them.

30:09.474 --> 30:10.934
-Oscar Foreman?
-Yep.

30:11.351 --> 30:13.978
Uh, he said there wouldn't be violence,
then I heard what they did on the radio.

30:14.062 --> 30:16.439
I'm Assistant District Attorney Bernstein,
Mr. Foreman.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.233
Have you been apprised of your rights?

30:18.316 --> 30:19.943
I'm-I'm sick, I'm sick. This gambling--

30:20.026 --> 30:22.278
-Come on. Answer the man!
-Yes. Oh, yes. Yes.

30:22.362 --> 30:24.864
Lester Franco and the others
have committed murder, Mr. Foreman,

30:24.948 --> 30:27.283
and they are now
holding guards as hostages.

30:27.367 --> 30:30.995
This makes you a suspected accessory
in a series of capital crimes.

30:31.079 --> 30:33.790
-Oh, my God.
-If you will help these detectives,

30:33.873 --> 30:36.918
my office will take your assistance
into account, do you understand?

30:37.627 --> 30:41.130
(sighs) Can you give me some numbers?

30:41.214 --> 30:43.091
One felony count, five years.

30:43.174 --> 30:45.844
(sighs) Uh...

30:46.219 --> 30:49.264
Tony Devine comes to my house
in the middle of the night,

30:50.098 --> 30:52.475
throws me on the floor
in front of my wife,

30:52.559 --> 30:54.143
and he puts a gun to my head.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.274
Give us what we want, Foreman.

31:01.484 --> 31:07.323
He told me to pack four pieces on a bus,
then I stashed three cars.

31:07.407 --> 31:08.491
Where? Come on!

31:08.575 --> 31:12.078
Uh... (clears throat) the first one's
under the Filmore underpass.

31:12.996 --> 31:15.039
Call the captain. Filmore underpass.

31:15.248 --> 31:16.875
Hey, Leo,
is this the patch to the Heights?

31:16.958 --> 31:18.626
What the hell do you mean, did she hit me?

31:18.710 --> 31:20.920
S&amp;M does not make this
a sexual offense, Henry.

31:21.004 --> 31:23.339
-We'd have to prove assault.
-I told you this.

31:23.798 --> 31:27.385
-You, Schnitz, your posture is terrible.
-Hey, button it, toots!

31:27.468 --> 31:29.637
-Hey, give me the Captain.
-RAY: Reconvening downstairs.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.265
Captain, bingo,
we got where Franco's going.

31:32.849 --> 31:35.685
-LUCY: Hey, guys, we found your unit.
-(indistinct dialogue)

31:35.768 --> 31:37.729
Yeah, except the computer terminal
was ripped out

31:37.812 --> 31:39.105
and the code book was missing.

31:39.188 --> 31:43.109
Probably some little duster playing
<i>Space Invaders</i> with it as we speak.

31:43.192 --> 31:45.403
-That's not the bottom line, Andrew.
-BOBBY: What is?

31:45.653 --> 31:49.991
They're gonna have to redo the codes,
and it's gonna cost $63,000 to re-program.

31:50.074 --> 31:51.451
Sixty-three thousand?

31:51.534 --> 31:54.954
Maybe it'll teach the city a lesson,
'cause the damn contraption doesn't work.

31:55.038 --> 31:57.123
It's too small.
It's got all them little computer--

31:57.206 --> 31:59.792
-Tell that to IAD.
-All them little--

32:00.710 --> 32:01.628
Oh, Bobby.

32:02.754 --> 32:06.049
I got pain and oblivion
swooping down on me,

32:06.132 --> 32:09.135
tearing out my heart
just like they tore out that computer.

32:09.218 --> 32:10.845
-Come on, Andy.
-What time is it?

32:11.304 --> 32:15.183
Four-thirty. I got nothing left to give.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.646
-BOBBY: Hey, Joe.
-Luce, can I talk to you?

32:24.067 --> 32:25.276
Luce, I did something.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.362
When I promised this morning
about that horse--

32:27.445 --> 32:28.279
about betting that horse...

32:28.905 --> 32:32.033
-You bet the horse?
-I remembered this bookie in the Heights.

32:32.116 --> 32:33.785
Do you know how many different
ways that is wrong?

32:33.868 --> 32:36.537
Look, I didn't make the bet.
I gave it to this--

32:36.621 --> 32:38.247
Stop it right there. Bobby.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.041
I can't believe you, Joe.

32:40.124 --> 32:41.918
Besides everything else,
you jeopardized Andy's present.

32:42.001 --> 32:44.170
Look, if it doesn't come in,
I'll make good on the money.

32:44.504 --> 32:45.588
He made a mistake. He bet the horse.

32:46.756 --> 32:49.968
Look, I just had a feeling, Bobby.
I just wanted to take a shot for Andy.

32:51.177 --> 32:53.262
I guess I'm not one to be throwing stones.

32:55.765 --> 32:56.849
Hey, I'm sorry, Bobby.

32:58.851 --> 33:03.398
It's simple A-B-C, man.
Bloods and Diablos knock each other out.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.484
Now it's Mau Mau's turn to step up.

33:06.567 --> 33:09.278
(all clamoring)

33:09.362 --> 33:10.530
Yo! Yo!

33:14.534 --> 33:17.412
You see, Dudley, everybody wants a piece,

33:17.745 --> 33:19.998
but you all take your pieces,
that gets Blood and Diablo

33:20.081 --> 33:24.252
down to itty-bitty chunks, you see?
And-and then six months later,

33:24.335 --> 33:26.754
when there's trouble again,
there's gonna be more war.

33:27.338 --> 33:32.010
The point is,
when your enemy's down, be generous.

33:32.093 --> 33:33.761
Let the man breathe a little.

33:33.845 --> 33:37.140
-The man speaks like a Diablo shill.
-MAN 1: Yeah, that's right, man.

33:37.223 --> 33:40.226
(all murmuring)

33:40.309 --> 33:43.438
Bloods, Diablos,
you can forget about what you had before.

33:43.771 --> 33:45.565
You're weak in men and in leadership.

33:45.648 --> 33:48.985
Like you said man... not for long.

33:49.277 --> 33:51.863
-Not in your lifetime.
-You shut your mouth, man.

33:51.946 --> 33:55.158
For now, Ramon,
treaties now reflects facts.

33:55.992 --> 33:59.370
So you give a little,
say you're not too proud.

33:59.454 --> 34:00.371
You're a realist.

34:00.455 --> 34:03.666
-Don't give nothin' to Mau Mau or Dragons.
-Yeah, we hear that.

34:03.750 --> 34:06.627
You don't have to, Ramon.
You don't have to.

34:07.128 --> 34:11.132
You give two blocks to DMZ.
Bloods, you do the same. You get it?

34:11.591 --> 34:14.927
It's insurance, bro,
'cause Diablos can't fight Mau Mau,

34:15.011 --> 34:20.266
can't fight Gypsies, can't fight anybody,
and every man in this room knows that.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.897
Lieutenant, can we vote
on a ceasefire now?

34:27.398 --> 34:29.609
Warlords, prepare to vote on a ceasefire.

34:29.692 --> 34:33.738
Everybody understand that?
We're not voting on treaties.

34:34.530 --> 34:37.325
-First a ceasefire.
-(murmuring)

34:37.408 --> 34:43.164
All DMZs in one place.
If that's approved, warlords can leave.

34:43.706 --> 34:45.083
The leader of each gang stays on,

34:45.166 --> 34:48.086
and we stay on and work on
the Martinez map proposal.

34:50.046 --> 34:51.339
-Blood?
-Oh, what's the vote?

34:52.381 --> 34:55.134
Immediate ceasefire, all DMZs in place.

34:57.053 --> 34:58.262
Bloods say yes.

34:59.847 --> 35:04.018
RAY: Mau Mau?
Treaty now, map proposals afterward.

35:04.268 --> 35:06.854
Yeah, got it.

35:07.480 --> 35:11.651
Good. Gonna get
the whole cuchifritos, Raymondo.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.823
MAN (whispers): What's happening?
What's taking so long?

35:17.907 --> 35:22.120
(siren wailing)

35:22.411 --> 35:25.164
Well, I think, uh, we should--
we should just let them get out of here--

35:25.248 --> 35:26.958
Person's trying to help,
they steal his golf clubs.

35:27.041 --> 35:28.167
Judge, please.

35:28.835 --> 35:30.962
I think our best bet
is at the last switch.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.713
Take them at the Franklin overpass?

35:32.797 --> 35:35.174
We'll let them lose armed surveillance
at the Filmore underpass.

35:35.258 --> 35:36.592
They'll think they're clear.

35:37.009 --> 35:38.010
-Did you hear, Sergeant?
-Yeah.

35:38.094 --> 35:39.595
We agree. We're gonna let them leave here.

35:39.679 --> 35:41.097
-Take them at the warehouse, yes.
-Right.

35:41.180 --> 35:43.307
How many hostages you need, Lester?

35:43.975 --> 35:45.434
You're gonna be holding a cop.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.603
No. For the last time, no!

35:47.687 --> 35:51.315
Jimmy, he wants to come up here, fine.
We give up no hostages.

35:51.566 --> 35:53.818
-Give them one.
-For crying out loud, Jimmy!

35:53.901 --> 35:57.405
None! You got two minutes.

36:01.617 --> 36:04.412
You're good, Lester.
We just got you clearance to move, okay?

36:04.495 --> 36:06.497
-That's great.
-JIMMY: Now, let's pass on the exchange,

36:06.581 --> 36:08.249
we pass on Mike Belker. What do you think?

36:08.332 --> 36:10.459
We tell you who's passing and who isn't!

36:10.543 --> 36:14.255
-No good, Jimmy! We pass!
-(gunshots)

36:15.506 --> 36:19.594
-Joey! Joey, my God!
-Stand back or I'm gonna shoot!

36:21.387 --> 36:22.889
I just want to get out of here
with you, Franco.

36:22.972 --> 36:24.015
I just want to get out of here.

36:33.316 --> 36:34.483
You're lucky, Mike!

36:34.692 --> 36:37.778
He wasn't gonna kiss you,
he was gonna blow your head off.

36:39.989 --> 36:41.699
WOMAN (over radio): <i>All units,</i>
<i>suspects have switched vehicles</i>

36:41.782 --> 36:42.950
<i>at Filmore underpass.</i>

36:43.034 --> 36:46.245
<i>Vehicle is a blue Dodge,</i>
<i>license: Paul-6763.</i>

36:46.329 --> 36:47.205
<i>East on Huron.</i>

36:47.288 --> 36:49.707
<i>Presumed destination,</i>
<i>Franklin Street warehouse.</i>

36:53.085 --> 36:55.713
Just on the car switches,
they must've spent 20 grand.

36:56.005 --> 36:58.591
WOMAN (on radio)
<i>Suspect vehicle's ETA is 45 seconds.</i>

36:58.674 --> 37:00.259
-Forty-five seconds.
-Block escape route.

37:00.343 --> 37:03.721
Give them time to get the door up.
We're gonna be bringing cars in behind.

37:05.932 --> 37:06.849
On my order.

37:07.433 --> 37:08.768
(vehicle approaches, brakes squeal)

37:08.976 --> 37:09.810
(car door opens)

37:15.524 --> 37:17.401
-Now.
-(gunshot)

37:18.611 --> 37:19.528
Okay, let's hit it!

37:21.239 --> 37:22.823
-Joey! Don't move!
-OFFICER 1: Freeze!

37:23.449 --> 37:24.992
Don't shoot! You got me!

37:25.076 --> 37:26.285
WOMAN: You got to shoot him!

37:26.369 --> 37:28.996
-(siren wailing)
-Please! Shoot him!

37:32.041 --> 37:34.794
These phone calls are gonna show up
in the printout, Sarge.

37:34.877 --> 37:37.213
-Who do I put the authorization to?
-To me.

37:38.005 --> 37:41.842
-The horse race result line in Florida.
-So write it down as a wrong number.

37:42.385 --> 37:44.095
-JOE: Hey, the flag's up.
-They're off.

37:44.804 --> 37:46.722
-MAN (on phone): <i>And they're off.</i>
-They're off.

37:46.806 --> 37:48.557
Okay. Just-just let him break loose.

37:48.641 --> 37:51.435
It's Lark to Win, Roseman,
Sticky Surprise...

37:51.686 --> 37:53.896
-Where's Donnybrook?
-And Donnybrook, fourth on the rail.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.439
Good. Fourth on the rail is good.

37:55.523 --> 38:00.278
After which is Alice's Dreamboat,
Northern Traffic, and Louie's Trick.

38:00.778 --> 38:01.612
Around the far turn.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.948
Okay. Just let him start to break.
Start to break. Please.

38:04.031 --> 38:05.700
Lark to Win opens a two-length lead.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.202
It's Roseman, Sticky Surprise,

38:08.286 --> 38:10.162
-LUCY: Where's Donnybrook?
-...and Donnybrook.

38:10.246 --> 38:11.497
These three race as a team.

38:11.580 --> 38:12.832
Two lengths, all right!

38:12.915 --> 38:15.209
-Come on, Donnybrook!
-JOE: Northern Traffic is fifth.

38:15.626 --> 38:17.086
The field is bunching at the front end.

38:17.420 --> 38:18.671
Here we go. We're coming on!

38:18.754 --> 38:21.507
Lark to Win is joined by Roseman
and Donnybrook

38:21.882 --> 38:23.175
as the field turns for home.

38:24.260 --> 38:26.762
-Come on, Donnybrook!
-Okay. I got us some prayers. Thank you.

38:26.846 --> 38:28.848
It's Lark to Win, Roseman, Donnybrook.

38:29.807 --> 38:31.559
-Lark to Win, Roseman, Donnybrook.
-Come on, Donnybrook.

38:31.642 --> 38:32.518
Baby, come on!

38:32.977 --> 38:35.146
Roseman and Donnybrook,
as Lark to Win falls off.

38:35.229 --> 38:36.355
Yes!

38:37.940 --> 38:40.067
-MAN: <i>And it's Donnybrook at the wire.</i>
-And it's Donnybrook at the wire.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.862
-(all cheering)
-All right!

38:43.362 --> 38:46.032
-By the shortest of noses!
-Good call, Joe!

38:46.115 --> 38:48.784
Uh, it wasn't me,
it was the horse, believe me.

38:49.243 --> 38:51.329
-What's up?
-Nothing.

39:00.588 --> 39:02.673
They approved the treaty
and the map proposals.

39:02.757 --> 39:03.966
Congratulations.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.010
-JESUS: Piece of cake.
-I doubt that.

39:06.927 --> 39:09.555
Hey, listen, Furillo, maybe you want
to take it from here, all right?

39:10.181 --> 39:12.141
Did it get to you, Jesus,
being a good guy?

39:12.475 --> 39:15.644
See that's what I don't like,
good guys, bad guys.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.646
I just like it where there's just guys.

39:17.730 --> 39:19.732
I'd say there's a job for you
if you want it.

39:19.815 --> 39:21.609
What about the social services dude?

39:21.692 --> 39:22.693
-FRANK: The hell with him.
-Jesus!

39:22.777 --> 39:25.488
-(groans)
-(shouting in Spanish)

39:26.197 --> 39:28.240
Easy, easy, easy.
Give me a handkerchief! Anybody!

39:28.324 --> 39:29.575
-Here, here!
-Get a stretcher!

39:29.658 --> 39:32.578
(clamoring)

39:32.870 --> 39:35.539
-Can you press it?
-It's bad. It's in the belly.

39:35.623 --> 39:37.208
-Stretcher!
-Where is that stretcher?

39:39.460 --> 39:42.213
Drive him to St. Joe's.
Come on. Come on, somebody grab him.

39:42.296 --> 39:44.673
-Grab his feet. Come on! Up!
-(grunts)

39:44.965 --> 39:45.883
Up, okay?

39:45.966 --> 39:49.345
Can you hold it? You got it?
Do me another favor today, Jesus.

39:50.304 --> 39:52.807
Listen, they haven't made
the knife to kill me yet.

39:53.849 --> 39:57.353
-Easy. Okay. Go.
-Yo, call my wife.

39:58.187 --> 40:00.689
OFFICER 1:
Move it! Let them through! Come on!

40:01.732 --> 40:02.650
Sorry, I'm late.

40:02.733 --> 40:05.069
-(belches)
-(Joe whistles)

40:05.152 --> 40:07.113
-RENKO: What?
-I guess I'm next, aren't I?

40:07.196 --> 40:08.489
-RENKO: What?
-I'm next to get married.

40:08.572 --> 40:09.490
You know what? I'll tell you something.

40:09.573 --> 40:12.576
My brother ain't gonna be sitting
here doing like that acting like a fool,

40:12.660 --> 40:13.828
making noises like that.

40:13.911 --> 40:15.121
-Look at this.
-Give me that.

40:15.204 --> 40:17.206
I can't get the thing tied,
because it's a clip.

40:17.289 --> 40:19.875
Hey, good crowd. How's the main performer?

40:19.959 --> 40:20.793
RENKO: Fine.

40:21.252 --> 40:24.338
Hey, somebody here.

40:26.340 --> 40:29.301
-Father LaRue to see the condemned man.
-JOE: Hey, J.D.!

40:29.385 --> 40:30.428
BOBBY: Out of the old hospital bed, huh?

40:30.511 --> 40:32.471
-You know, my nurse was an inspiration.
-How you doing?

40:32.555 --> 40:33.639
-How you doing, kid, huh?
-Okay.

40:33.722 --> 40:35.891
-Nice tux. Phew!
-Yeah, you fit right in.

40:35.975 --> 40:38.602
Yeah, Vic Hitler's final legacy.
Hey! How's the boy chick?

40:38.686 --> 40:40.980
-Hey, J.D.
-Any last minute yips?

40:41.063 --> 40:43.607
I'm a little nervous.
I'm not real nervous.

40:44.108 --> 40:44.984
Bless you, my son.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.573
-That poor slob's falling apart.
-(door slams)

40:50.656 --> 40:55.494
(scoffs) Hey, 4,300 bucks,
less you ought to give to Lenny.

40:55.578 --> 40:58.038
-Fantastic!
-Hey, let me ask you a question.

40:58.414 --> 41:00.207
Uh, do we have to give Andy all of this?

41:00.499 --> 41:01.834
No, I'm just saying,
what difference does it make

41:01.917 --> 41:04.837
-if we give him maybe three of it?
-Thirteen hundred dollars, Joe.

41:04.920 --> 41:07.715
Uh, uh, something I could help
you guys with?

41:09.925 --> 41:12.219
(indistinct chatter)

41:31.572 --> 41:33.866
Uh, you're coming on
pretty strong, Howard.

41:35.117 --> 41:36.535
Oh, horse smell.

41:36.619 --> 41:40.080
I'm sorry, it was selfish of me,
but I just guess I didn't want to lose it.

41:40.539 --> 41:41.499
You can always sit in the corner.

41:41.582 --> 41:44.376
You know, Henry,
there is a story about an Irish Cob

41:44.460 --> 41:50.758
at Waterloo that pulled her fieldpiece
for ten miles with a bullet in her heart.

41:51.842 --> 41:54.303
-Noble, noble animals.
-How's Apollo?

41:56.055 --> 41:59.350
-Apollo passed away not an hour ago.
-I'm sorry.

41:59.433 --> 42:03.354
No. No, it was a--
it was a wondrous thing, Henry.

42:04.271 --> 42:05.940
When that spirit went out
of that great beast,

42:06.023 --> 42:12.154
I fell in love, a pure love like I have...
I don't think I have ever felt before.

42:12.738 --> 42:14.615
I wept-- not in regret,

42:14.698 --> 42:18.702
but in relief that
his suffering had ended in pity...

42:20.496 --> 42:21.330
and love.

42:22.373 --> 42:25.501
(chuckles) I guess I should be
embarrassed at carrying on.

42:27.002 --> 42:29.838
-No.
-What a curious...

42:31.173 --> 42:34.468
(voice breaking)
What a curious... Oh, forgive me.

42:37.888 --> 42:38.722
(sniffles)

42:40.057 --> 42:43.894
I'm sorry, I couldn't help
overhearing what you just said.

42:44.562 --> 42:47.982
-Oh, I see. Uh--
-I couldn't help over-smelling you either.

42:48.190 --> 42:49.692
Perhaps I should excuse myself.

42:49.775 --> 42:53.195
No. No, what I mean is,
I'm kind of a stranger here,

42:53.279 --> 42:56.073
and, well, that smell certainly
makes me feel at home.

42:57.074 --> 43:00.202
-You work with horses?
-I'm a hot walker at Marcy Downs.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.830
-I'm a friend of the bride's.
-Really?

43:03.330 --> 43:07.251
Yeah. Would you know a place in the city
where I could ride tomorrow?

43:08.085 --> 43:12.131
Oh, I could show you a lovely bridle path,
perfect for the early morning.

43:13.507 --> 43:15.342
Until today,
I could've offered you a mount.

43:16.468 --> 43:18.846
Well, maybe we can
still work something out, um...

43:21.223 --> 43:22.349
(sniffles)

43:22.433 --> 43:23.726
JOE: Hey, they want us to line up.

43:23.809 --> 43:24.727
Say, Andy?

43:29.773 --> 43:31.984
-Showtime!
-Andy?

43:37.197 --> 43:38.407
Oh, no!

43:49.710 --> 43:51.545
-Andy?
-Captain?

43:52.504 --> 43:54.048
The wedding's in there, isn't it?

43:54.131 --> 43:56.091
Yes, sir. I'm just trying to get some air.

43:57.551 --> 43:59.511
-Maybe you better go on.
-Okay.

44:00.095 --> 44:01.597
-Mind if I walk with you?
-RENKO: No, sir.

44:08.729 --> 44:10.606
-I really appreciate you coming down.
-Nice night, huh?

44:10.689 --> 44:11.649
-Excuse me.
-Go ahead.

44:15.069 --> 44:17.905
-Family all here?
-Such as it is.

44:20.032 --> 44:22.034
-And Daryl Ann's?
-Yes, sir.

44:25.496 --> 44:26.372
So, how is it?

44:28.123 --> 44:28.957
What's that?

44:31.251 --> 44:32.169
Being married.

44:32.544 --> 44:35.339
It's hard to compare it to anything.
It's real, Andy.

44:36.423 --> 44:37.800
It's a real experience.

44:40.386 --> 44:41.929
How about if you're not sure?

44:43.889 --> 44:46.642
-I wish I could tell you that goes away.
-It doesn't, huh?

44:48.018 --> 44:49.853
Sometimes. Never for very long.

44:50.312 --> 44:52.022
It comes with the territory, I guess.

44:54.608 --> 44:55.442
But it's worth it?

44:56.360 --> 44:57.695
-BOBBY: Cowboy?
-Yes.

44:59.154 --> 45:01.448
When you add it up, yeah.

45:03.325 --> 45:04.159
Something wrong?

45:05.077 --> 45:07.371
No, I'm just getting some air.

45:08.914 --> 45:11.083
Um, they're waiting inside.

45:12.543 --> 45:13.460
It's time.

45:14.545 --> 45:16.547
...in token and in pledge...

45:16.630 --> 45:19.842
PRIEST: ...of our constant faith
and abiding love...

45:20.384 --> 45:23.262
...of our constant faith and abiding
love...

45:23.345 --> 45:25.514
...with this ring, I thee wed.

45:25.848 --> 45:28.100
...with this ring, I thee wed.

45:30.728 --> 45:35.899
For as much as Andy and Daryl Ann
have consented together in holy wedlock

45:35.983 --> 45:38.444
by pledging their faith,
each to the other,

45:39.027 --> 45:41.280
and have declared the same
by joining hands

45:41.363 --> 45:43.407
and by giving and receiving rings,

45:43.949 --> 45:47.745
I pronounce that they are
husband and wife.

45:48.787 --> 45:51.623
What God has joined together,
let no one put asunder.

45:55.210 --> 45:56.920
You may kiss the bride, Andrew.

45:57.421 --> 45:58.255
(giggles)

46:18.150 --> 46:21.612
You know, sometimes I regret
we didn't have a real wedding.

46:25.949 --> 46:27.910
We had a hell of a wedding night, though.

46:28.911 --> 46:31.497
(both laugh)

46:32.748 --> 46:35.334
Uh-huh. (laughs)
So I recall.

46:47.137 --> 46:48.347
Are you all packed?

46:49.306 --> 46:50.140
Pretty much.

46:54.269 --> 46:55.813
I'm gonna miss you terribly.

47:00.442 --> 47:02.945
You're not making it very easy
for me to go, Pizza Man.

47:07.074 --> 47:09.827
I'm trying to make it easier
for you to come home, Counselor.

47:14.414 --> 47:15.290
Come with me.

47:19.336 --> 47:21.004
You said you needed the time alone.

47:21.964 --> 47:22.881
I know...

47:24.883 --> 47:28.136
(sighs) But I think I'm more afraid
to be alone...

47:29.513 --> 47:30.597
than I thought I'd be.

47:34.518 --> 47:36.311
I'd love to go to Paris with you...

47:39.064 --> 47:40.858
but it needs to be
because we want to be together,

47:40.941 --> 47:42.693
not because we're afraid to be alone.

47:50.158 --> 47:51.285
(sighs)

47:54.329 --> 47:55.831
At least spend the night.

48:07.968 --> 48:09.803
Only if you twist my arm.

48:11.763 --> 48:13.181
(laughs)

48:23.108 --> 48:26.111
(closing theme playing)
