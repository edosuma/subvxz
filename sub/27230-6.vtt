WEBVTT

00:10.301 --> 00:12.303
[theme music playing]

01:09.194 --> 01:11.071
We have confirmation
that Honerva's beasts

01:11.154 --> 01:14.574
have touched down
on planets Sanook, VeXilum, Siiz,

01:14.657 --> 01:16.910
and we continue to receive
more transmissions.

01:17.660 --> 01:20.163
This is consistent with the reports
I'm receiving as well.

01:20.705 --> 01:23.374
The wormhole signatures
we discovered on Olkarion,

01:23.458 --> 01:25.752
they were a map
to where the Robeasts were headed.

01:25.835 --> 01:27.962
They must have been waiting
this entire time.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.633
They're targeting multiple fronts
simultaneously.

01:31.716 --> 01:32.675
What do we do?

01:33.009 --> 01:34.302
We keep our calm.

01:34.677 --> 01:37.222
Coran, continue to mark the planets
where the beasts have landed.

01:37.555 --> 01:40.517
Veronica, give us any real-time updates
as they come in.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.228
Copy that.
Just got another report from Sanook.

01:43.645 --> 01:47.023
The Robeasts are covered in some type
of shield like a particle barrier.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.067
They're not attacking the planet?

01:49.692 --> 01:50.777
Not yet.

01:52.695 --> 01:57.826
[Honerva] For eons our people
have suffered, cast out from our home,

01:58.284 --> 02:00.745
driven mad by the cursed Galra.

02:01.371 --> 02:06.292
We have sacrificed much.
You have sacrificed much.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.796
But Lotor gave more than any of us.

02:10.213 --> 02:14.551
And today, his ultimate wish
will be fulfilled.

02:18.179 --> 02:22.016
The Galra will pay
for what they have done to the Alteans.

02:22.517 --> 02:26.563
The end for anyone
that dares oppose us is near.

02:27.188 --> 02:29.524
It is time to begin.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.417
[all screaming]

02:50.086 --> 02:52.839
May Lotor's light guide you.

02:57.260 --> 03:01.180
The planets are reporting activity.
The Robeasts are siphoning Quintessence.

03:01.514 --> 03:04.350
We need to engage them all,
save as many people as we can.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.019
We're talking about triage here.

03:06.102 --> 03:07.604
We could split up the Lions.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.023
One Lion can't handle a Robeast
on its own.

03:10.106 --> 03:12.817
No, but it could slow them down,
buy us some time.

03:12.901 --> 03:15.153
I say we attack them
with the totality of our forces

03:15.236 --> 03:16.779
and wormhole from target to target.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.782
No. We must attack Oriande directly.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.743
I think I know what Honerva's doing.

03:21.993 --> 03:24.787
We know Honerva has the ability
to create wormholes

03:24.871 --> 03:27.665
and that these wormholes
are emanating from Oriande.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.835
She used a Robeast
to steal the Olkari cubes,

03:30.919 --> 03:33.838
which can mimic and intensify energy
at a distance.

03:34.297 --> 03:37.217
And those Robeasts
are essentially armed with Komars,

03:37.300 --> 03:40.511
able to drain and transmit
massive amounts of Quintessence.

03:41.054 --> 03:45.350
Honerva is going to concentrate energy
from across the universe to Oriande.

03:46.100 --> 03:50.271
She is making a Komar magnitudes larger
than anything we've ever seen,

03:50.688 --> 03:54.067
something that could drain
the Quintessence from an entire galaxy.

03:55.276 --> 03:56.277
No.

03:57.528 --> 03:58.613
That monster.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.617
What could she possibly need
that much energy for?

04:02.951 --> 04:05.703
I don't know,
but we need to act immediately.

04:05.787 --> 04:09.624
The only way for us to stop them
is by going directly to Oriande.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.793
Then that's what Voltron is gonna do.

04:12.543 --> 04:13.836
The Atlas will accompany you.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.506
We don't have time to wait
for the rest of the Coalition.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.217
Contact Matt, let him know
the rebels are gonna be in charge

04:19.300 --> 04:21.844
of the evacuation efforts
for the occupied planets.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.471
They shouldn't expect assistance.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.682
Then we are in agreement.

04:25.765 --> 04:28.351
It is time to begin our assault
on Oriande.

04:31.187 --> 04:33.690
-[Allura] Is everyone ready?
-[Shiro] We're in position.

04:36.025 --> 04:39.320
[Allura] The universe is facing
the gravest threat it has ever seen.

04:39.904 --> 04:45.868
Honerva has exploited a vulnerable people,
my people, and bent them to her will.

04:46.411 --> 04:50.081
She convinced them to pilot
her abominations and commit heinous acts.

04:50.415 --> 04:54.419
And now she has built a weapon
that can destroy an entire galaxy.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.922
Today, we risk our lives
for the greater good.

04:58.339 --> 05:01.592
We are the only thing that can stop her
and defend the universe.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.512
It is time to end this war.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.681
[energy powers up]

05:10.226 --> 05:11.811
[energy powers up]

05:30.288 --> 05:31.664

05:49.182 --> 05:50.850
[Matt] Is everyone else seeing this?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.019
[N-7] Matt, what is happening?

05:53.436 --> 05:56.355
I don't know, but we're going to save
as many people as we can.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.493
-[alarm blaring]
-Sam, we're experiencing interference.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.745
-Can you lock that down?
-[Sam] I'm on it.

06:10.953 --> 06:14.874
This interference is multi-phasal.
What could cause something like this?

06:14.957 --> 06:17.251
Wait, what color socks are you wearing?

06:17.335 --> 06:20.171
-What? Why does that matter?
-You didn't answer me.

06:20.254 --> 06:21.672
Why didn't you answer me?

06:21.756 --> 06:25.009
There's a 99 3/5 chance
the multi-phasal interference

06:25.093 --> 06:27.178
is from a reality-ending event!

06:28.096 --> 06:29.597
Because of my socks?

06:29.806 --> 06:32.100
We need to modify
the dichromate resonance chamber

06:32.183 --> 06:34.602
-to a super position.
-Good thinking.

06:34.685 --> 06:37.688
That will isolate
the mutated antimatter isotopes.

06:37.772 --> 06:40.066
And please put on some green socks!

06:40.525 --> 06:44.403
The Atlas can't go much further due
to the Petrulian Zone's radiation. [gasps]

06:44.862 --> 06:47.240
There they are! The Olkari cubes!

06:48.449 --> 06:50.910
[Iverson] I'm not picking up
any energy signatures.

06:50.993 --> 06:52.036
They must not be active.

06:52.411 --> 06:55.706
I'm picking something up.
It's coming from the white hole.

06:56.791 --> 06:57.875
The Guardian.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.971
-No! Where is the Guardian?
-[alarm blaring]

07:10.263 --> 07:12.265
We don't have time to engage
these Robeasts.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.642
-Can you clear a path?
-We'll get you through.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.812
Atlas crew,
prepare for transformation sequence.

07:48.384 --> 07:52.013
Okay, Voltron, engaging now.
Good luck out there.

07:52.180 --> 07:55.391
Good luck to you as well.
I'm deferring command to Allura.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.178
Voltron is clear.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.847
We need to first focus
on neutralizing those Robeasts.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.850
Then we can attack those cubes
to try and halt the process.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.205
[Allura] She's destroyed the Guardian!

10:24.206 --> 10:26.542
We have to stop that witch immediately!

10:27.793 --> 10:30.463
It's Voltron.
Defend our goddess!

11:02.536 --> 11:04.372
We're not going to make it
through their blockade.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.539
What's the plan?

11:05.623 --> 11:08.668
Scramble the MFEs.
We need their precise striking ability.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.504
Pilots, attack the weak spot
on their chest plate

11:11.587 --> 11:12.922
when their cannon fires.

-[pilots] Copy.
-[Shiro] Stay safe out there.

11:15.299 --> 11:17.927
Give them heavy covering fire
so they can get in close.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.810
I think we're in the middle of a battle.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.020
-We need to get out of here.
-No!

We've got a security breach
reported in cell block 2-1-4.

11:35.152 --> 11:37.321
Zethrid and the Olkari
have escaped their cells.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.990
It looks like they're on their way
to the bridge.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.076

11:59.176 --> 12:01.554
What? How did you even escape?

12:02.680 --> 12:05.099

Let my tech help.

12:18.654 --> 12:19.488
Fine.

12:21.657 --> 12:24.743
Excellent job fusing Earth technology
with Altean magic.

Recovering all systems.

to the Atlas safely.

Griffin and Leifsdottir,

13:01.155 --> 13:03.657
use this opportunity to hone in
on the Robeast's crystal.

[Lance] Wha... What is going on?

14:12.268 --> 14:14.270
[Hunk] Are those people down there?

14:15.145 --> 14:18.440
[Pidge] According to my readings,
we're seeing into other realities.

14:18.524 --> 14:19.358
[Lance] What?

14:19.650 --> 14:22.486
[Pidge] There must be some kind of rip
in the fabric of time.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.655
The essence of realities is leaking out.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.449
Honerva is tearing apart time lines.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.743
She could cause irreparable damage
to reality itself.

anything like this before.

of the thera-magnetic oscillator.

15:30.679 --> 15:32.640
What? I thought you were kidding.

15:32.723 --> 15:36.143
Oh, no! I think we were just hit
with time spillage.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.227
Time spillage?

15:37.603 --> 15:40.147
It's a rip in the fabric of this reality.

15:40.230 --> 15:44.234
Pulses of Quintessence are disassociating

How do we fix it?

For starters,
you have to take off your socks!

Join me and our people.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.324
Together, we will go back to Altea.

We cannot go back.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.502
This is what he would have wanted.

19:31.128 --> 19:34.339
-Join me and the Alteans.
-Never!

19:34.882 --> 19:36.758
You cannot keep me here forever.

19:37.217 --> 19:41.013
And the moment you release your hold,
I will end you.

19:41.096 --> 19:43.348
Then you will end your friends as well.

19:43.807 --> 19:47.436
I am the only thing keeping my son at bay.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.982
Join the right side of this war.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.617
[grunting]

20:04.244 --> 20:06.079
[sobbing]

20:21.678 --> 20:23.639
-[monitors beeping]
-[all grunting]

20:23.722 --> 20:26.850
Captain, Commander Holt
got the Atlas back online.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.435
Get the MFEs on board.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.825
[rumbling]

21:07.266 --> 21:09.059
[Allura] Paladins, are you there?

21:10.310 --> 21:12.229
-[booms]
-[grunts, pants]

21:13.730 --> 21:15.065
Paladins, respond.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.527
We must get out of here
or we will all perish.

21:19.027 --> 21:19.987
Allura.

21:22.030 --> 21:25.158
I'm moving again.
Pidge, Hunk?

21:25.701 --> 21:28.328
-[groans] I'm here.
-Yellow's back online.

21:29.204 --> 21:30.122
Let's move.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.542
[Pidge] The white hole is closing.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.628
If we don't get out,
we'll be trapped here forever.

21:39.047 --> 21:42.217
The white hole's energy is collapsing
into a gravity surge.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.428
There's no way we'll hit escape velocity.

21:44.928 --> 21:47.723
At this point, our only hope of escape
is via wormhole.

21:48.056 --> 21:49.141
How long do we have?

21:49.558 --> 21:51.643
Minutes? Seconds?

21:52.060 --> 21:54.396
It's impossible to be sure
with these surges.

21:55.105 --> 21:57.274
Coran, move us
into position to intercept.

21:57.357 --> 21:58.483
[Coran] Adjusting heading.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.069
Sam, I need every ounce of power
you can give us.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.280
[Sam] Pulling energy from all systems.

22:03.739 --> 22:04.948
[Shiro] They'll come.

22:05.699 --> 22:08.618
-[alarm blaring]
-The white hole's about to collapse.

22:08.702 --> 22:09.870
[Coran] They're here!

22:14.624 --> 22:16.460
Coran, we need a wormhole now!

22:41.651 --> 22:43.653
[Hunk] What the heck just happened?

22:44.988 --> 22:45.989
We failed.

22:46.615 --> 22:49.242
And every reality will pay the price.
