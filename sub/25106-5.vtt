I was thinking, "You know,

a thing or two from Kimmy Wayne."

Don't interrupt me.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.911
Yeah, we can go right this way.
Okay-- whoa!

08:56.995 --> 08:59.122
Men first. Thanks.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.001
You what?

09:03.084 --> 09:05.295
The documentary got it all wrong.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.921
Dick Wayne is a monster--

09:07.005 --> 09:08.715
and not a nice one like Cookie Monster,

09:08.798 --> 09:09.799
a scary one,

09:09.883 --> 09:12.469
like... Cookie Monster
if you were a cookie!

09:12.552 --> 09:14.137
Well, isn't this just a kick in the nut?

09:14.220 --> 09:15.180
Nuts.

09:15.805 --> 09:16.639
And a penis.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.224
I just can't believe it.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.185
They got to you too.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.646
Who was it? Killary and her husband, Kill?

09:23.730 --> 09:25.899
Wait. Do you not believe me?

09:25.982 --> 09:30.361
Jeez, I don't know. Who should I trust,
my best friend or some woman

09:30.445 --> 09:33.823
who just told me that she doesn't want
pudding at 10:30 in the morning?

09:33.907 --> 09:37.243
Look, I've read some of your blog.
I know you've had disappointments.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.328
Okay, look.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.623
"Between a dock
and a hard plate" <i>is </i> a saying.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.875
Like your appearance on <i>Wheel of Fortune.</i>

09:43.958 --> 09:45.585
There's also your mother's homosexuality.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.712
What does that have to do with it?
Why would you--

09:47.796 --> 09:49.047
[stammering] My mom...

09:49.130 --> 09:50.590
We're having a convers--

09:50.673 --> 09:51.883
And then you--

09:51.966 --> 09:54.469
Why does that have to come in if I--
Mm!

10:00.350 --> 10:01.476
I was aiming for that.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.353
I'm just trying to understand--

10:03.436 --> 10:05.647
You couldn't possibly understand

10:05.730 --> 10:08.608
what it is like to be a male
in this country today.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.152
You females have it so easy.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.487
Ex-squeeze me?

10:12.570 --> 10:15.448
Oh, please. Like, how come
when your body makes milk,

10:15.532 --> 10:16.658
it's "beautiful"?

10:16.741 --> 10:18.034
Well, as a woman,

10:18.118 --> 10:22.413
I can tell you it's not easy, breezy,
beautiful CoverGirl!

10:23.081 --> 10:24.124
It's tough!

10:24.207 --> 10:25.917
Ford tough! Barq's has bite!

10:26.000 --> 10:27.585
Stupid Soda Trickery Council.

10:27.669 --> 10:31.589
I have been a junior salesman
at Darryl's Bridal for 15 years.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.800
I have seen what females truly are.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.135
All you care about

10:35.218 --> 10:37.595
is the ring and the dress,

10:37.679 --> 10:39.973
and not one of you will go out with me!

10:40.056 --> 10:42.058
Because the women
who come in here are engaged.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.685
But I also hit on their moms!

10:44.185 --> 10:46.187
You all say, "I want a nice guy

10:46.271 --> 10:47.856
with a sense of humor,"

10:47.939 --> 10:50.108
and then when one
is standing right behind you,

10:50.191 --> 10:52.569
rubbing your shoulders
while you're looking at dresses,

10:52.652 --> 10:55.113
it's all, "That joke is racist, sir."

10:55.196 --> 10:59.701
All you guys do is blame everyone
but yourself for everything!

10:59.784 --> 11:02.078
Because that's whose fault it is!

11:02.162 --> 11:04.455
Society used to make sense:

11:04.539 --> 11:05.665
nuclear families,

11:05.748 --> 11:07.417
straight marriages,

11:07.500 --> 11:08.918
white quarterbacks.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.588
That is the world that the Reverend
was trying to get back to.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.505
Do not say it.

11:12.589 --> 11:15.508
The bunker was a return
to traditional values.

11:15.592 --> 11:16.843
Men are strong

11:16.926 --> 11:18.261
and good at maps,

11:18.344 --> 11:19.679
so they take care of women.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.055
And women are weak,

11:21.139 --> 11:23.141
so they can only take care of children.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.851
Children take care of dogs.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.769
Dogs take care of cats.

11:26.853 --> 11:27.812
And cats...

11:28.730 --> 11:29.814
just do their thing.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.190
I'm weak...

11:31.274 --> 11:33.443
but you, you're strong?

11:33.526 --> 11:36.279
Well, I got "macho man" on a grip tester

11:36.362 --> 11:38.531
at the Ground Round, so you tell me.

11:38.615 --> 11:39.532
All right.

11:40.116 --> 11:43.077
Why don't you show me
the natural order of things, <i>Fran</i> ?

11:43.161 --> 11:44.454
Oh, come-- It's a man's name!

11:44.537 --> 11:46.164
You know what? All right, missy.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.375
All aboard the pain train.

11:50.752 --> 11:52.086
[grunts]

11:52.170 --> 11:53.838
[groans]

11:55.256 --> 11:57.884
[grunts] You are a man!
It's the only explanation!

11:59.093 --> 12:00.720
[shouting]

12:03.932 --> 12:05.892
What the heck is wrong
with men in this country?

12:05.975 --> 12:07.685
Tell me about it. Oliver quit!

12:07.769 --> 12:09.646
No, you are not making this
about you that fast.

12:09.729 --> 12:10.563
[exhales slowly]

12:12.774 --> 12:14.609
- Fran Dodd took the Reverend's side!
- Sure.

12:14.692 --> 12:17.237
People get set in their ways.
They don't like to be told they're wrong.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.406
Remember how mad I got when you told me
it was <i>Sex </i> and <i>the City</i> ?

12:20.490 --> 12:22.116
[quietly] Um, yeah.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.369
I sure do.

12:24.953 --> 12:26.537
But these guys are just broken!

12:26.621 --> 12:28.873
They remind me of this foster dad
I lived with

12:28.957 --> 12:30.541
- while my mom was in jail--
- Mm, sorry.

12:30.625 --> 12:31.876
Time's up, so my turn.

12:31.960 --> 12:32.919
Oliver quit!

12:33.002 --> 12:34.170
Your Beest? But why?

12:34.253 --> 12:35.254
He couldn't cut it!

12:35.338 --> 12:36.589
He couldn't even sing...

12:38.174 --> 12:40.426
<i>♪ All I ask is you obey me ♪</i>

12:40.510 --> 12:42.595
<i>♪ Like you obey your thirst! ♪</i>

12:42.679 --> 12:43.846
<i>♪ Sprite! ♪</i>

12:45.139 --> 12:47.475
Boy, Titus,
maybe you're making these songs too hard.

12:47.558 --> 12:48.434
"Too hard"?

12:49.852 --> 12:51.187
Well, excuse me for caring.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.189
You know, I never got
to be part of a school play

12:53.273 --> 12:55.692
because back home,
theater was considered gay...

12:56.150 --> 12:57.986
by the Mississippi Board of Education!

12:58.069 --> 13:00.238
I'm just saying, maybe dumb it down.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.323
But this is my directorial debut!

13:02.407 --> 13:04.033
Look at the posters.

13:07.245 --> 13:08.997
There is buzz, Kimmy.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.207
I'm told tickets sold out in record time.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.126
I cannot disappoint my pubic!

13:13.209 --> 13:16.129
Well, then you better find someone
who can sing your arrangements.

13:17.005 --> 13:17.839
"Someone"?

13:18.506 --> 13:20.299
That's an exact description of me.

13:21.259 --> 13:22.218
[Lillian] Hey.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.804
Wanna buy tickets to a school play?

13:24.887 --> 13:26.305
Just 100 bucks!

13:26.389 --> 13:28.099
Help out some kids!

13:28.182 --> 13:29.309
What the-- [scoffs]

13:30.059 --> 13:32.854
What-- what is going on with this town?

13:32.937 --> 13:34.689
Not a single bite.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.607
<i>And </i> I didn't sell any tickets.

13:36.691 --> 13:38.693
Me neither. Tourists are too savvy now.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.279
- I blame NBC's <i>Smash.</i>
- [Lillian] Well, this is bad.

13:41.362 --> 13:44.532
If we don't sell those tickets,
we're out 1,500 bucks.

13:44.615 --> 13:47.577
I know what we're selling is bad,
but most plays are bad.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.537
That's why they're plays and not movies.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.873
Yeah. And yet they sell out.

13:52.582 --> 13:55.752
I saw <i>Scopes </i> with my Russ.
It's incomprehensible.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.712
But it cost 100 bucks.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.965
No, more, but we paid extra
to be in the jury box.

14:01.049 --> 14:04.177
<i>Scopes </i> is an "immersive
theatrical experience"

14:04.260 --> 14:06.137
based on some play
about a teacher on trial.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.181
Inherit the wind.

14:08.264 --> 14:11.517
- I don't remember what it's called.
- No, I was just warning you I farted.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.853
Well, <i>Scopes </i> was weird.

14:13.936 --> 14:14.896
During the second act,

14:14.979 --> 14:18.566
I realized the chimpanzee sitting
next to me was part of the play.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.402
Well, if that counts as theater,

14:21.903 --> 14:25.907
what are we doing trying
to sell tickets to a school play?

14:25.990 --> 14:27.492
We should just lie

14:27.575 --> 14:29.786
and say we're selling tickets to a that.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.120
Yes!

14:31.204 --> 14:32.955
<i>Beaudy an' the Beest </i> is a...

14:33.790 --> 14:36.876
"site-specific fourth-wall-breaking

14:37.877 --> 14:38.920
Ugh!

14:39.003 --> 14:41.172
God, your fart just got to me.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.840
Why is it so slow?

You'll be old one day too!

14:46.552 --> 14:49.597
<i>♪ Can I escape this prison I'm in? ♪</i>

14:50.223 --> 14:51.724

14:51.808 --> 14:55.770
<i>♪ Sprite is technically a vegetable
Because of limon ♪</i>

14:56.187 --> 14:58.231
Mr. A, what are we going to do?

14:58.314 --> 15:00.525
<i>Beaudy an' the Beest </i> needs a Beest.

15:01.192 --> 15:02.568
That's a good point, Aisha.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.404
But no one can sing the part.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.407
I guess we'll just have
to put on a show that...

15:07.698 --> 15:08.699
isn't special.

15:08.783 --> 15:11.452

I don't know what to do! [sighs]

15:20.169 --> 15:21.921
I bet you guys could figure something out.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.215
Kids are so much smarter
than adults anyway.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.759
When's the last time a kid
had to resign from Congress

15:26.843 --> 15:29.220
after hiring someone to kill his mistress?

15:31.347 --> 15:34.100
Well...
what if you played the Beest, Mr. A?

15:34.183 --> 15:36.102
- [stammering] I can't--
- [students chattering]

15:36.185 --> 15:37.228
I cannot do that!

15:37.311 --> 15:39.564
Yeah, I mean, your voice is,
like, professional.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.275
- [stammers] Thank you--
- [Anne] And the Beest is big and scary,

15:42.358 --> 15:43.568
and you're the biggest here.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.778
You're forgetting about Hudson, but go on.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.113
You could save the show!

15:47.196 --> 15:49.282
It'd be so cool if you played him.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.741

- Please!

Those adult-size eyes.

It's an immersive theatrical experience.

How could I explain that to you?

17:24.752 --> 17:27.880
You know when the Harlem Globetrotters
throw confetti at the crowd?

17:27.964 --> 17:28.798
It's like that.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.258
We know what immersive theater is.

17:30.341 --> 17:34.011
Yeah, we saw <i>Scopes </i> at The Public.

Uh, we do have availability tomorrow.

I didn't realize the Beest
was such a creep.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.971
The Beest is a good guy!

18:17.555 --> 18:18.389
Eventually.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.224
But what's the message here?

18:20.308 --> 18:21.392
Take a girl prisoner,

18:21.475 --> 18:22.852
tell her what clothes to wear,

18:22.935 --> 18:24.604
and then she'll fall in love with you

18:24.687 --> 18:27.148
- just 'cause you didn't eat her?
- [Aisha] Help me!

18:27.231 --> 18:29.400
I need to help my father
with the soda harvest!

18:29.483 --> 18:31.193
[growls] Silence!

18:31.277 --> 18:34.530
You're acting like
a boring old pitcher of juice.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.491
- [Titus] This is...
- Oh, my gosh. Seriously?

18:38.117 --> 18:39.785
Did Titus actually put himself in this?

18:39.869 --> 18:41.203
No, the students did.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.164
And he saved the play.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.790

You never cared about the kids

19:05.227 --> 19:07.188
When it's a musical, we say "show."

19:07.271 --> 19:10.024
You just wanted
all the glory for yourself.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.734
That's why you made Hudson do wrestling.

Well, you can be in this play.
