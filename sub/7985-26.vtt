<i>Previously on</i> Dance Moms...

00:03.674 --> 00:05.310
The minis are back.

00:05.310 --> 00:07.348
We have a new
mini member.

00:07.348 --> 00:09.285
NIA: <i>The last time</i>
<i>I had a duet with Kendall,</i>

00:09.285 --> 00:10.354
<i>it didn't go over so well.</i>

00:10.354 --> 00:12.726
ABBY LEE:
This duet is

00:12.726 --> 00:13.728
inspired by

00:13.728 --> 00:15.899
Beyoncé and Lady Gaga.

00:15.899 --> 00:17.669
NIA:
<i>I'm not feeling very well.</i>

00:17.669 --> 00:18.370
Nia's sick.

00:18.370 --> 00:19.806
You're gonna jump in.

00:19.806 --> 00:22.111
ANNOUNCER: <i>First place</i>

00:22.111 --> 00:23.013
"Disconnected."

00:23.013 --> 00:25.752
(crowd cheering)

00:25.752 --> 00:29.091
ABBY LEE: <i>The mini group routine</i>
<i>is entitled "Cali Cuties."</i>

00:29.091 --> 00:30.562
<i>Who will win the crown?</i>

00:30.562 --> 00:32.031
My daughter is the
best one on this team.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.801
You need to back the (bleep)
out of my face, bitch.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.270
Stop! We're a team!

00:35.270 --> 00:36.272
ABBY LEE:
The crown

00:36.272 --> 00:38.443
goes to Areana.

00:39.713 --> 00:41.316
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

00:41.316 --> 00:43.186
I'm not gonna be below
the minis on a pyramid.

00:43.186 --> 00:44.523
This is stupid.
STACEY: <i>It's kind of cool</i>

00:44.523 --> 00:46.025
<i>that our girls are doing</i>

00:46.025 --> 00:47.494
the dance
that's close to her heart.

00:50.668 --> 00:51.737
This is offensive.

00:51.737 --> 00:54.041
Abby, this cannot go on stage.

00:54.041 --> 00:56.045
So you guys don't have
a group dance this time?

00:56.045 --> 00:57.582
We get under their skin.

00:57.582 --> 00:58.751
They would not
be this bothered

00:58.751 --> 00:59.987
<i>if they were not threatened.</i>

00:59.987 --> 01:01.690
HOLLY: Their intent is
to take our girls down.

01:01.690 --> 01:03.661
ANNOUNCER:
<i>In third place...</i>

01:04.763 --> 01:05.832
Get out. Get out!

01:07.736 --> 01:08.738
Are you injured in any way?

01:08.738 --> 01:11.275
You're a role model! For who?!

01:12.879 --> 01:15.885
♪ Livin' on the dance floor. ♪

<i>Seems kind of quiet today.</i>

SARI:
<i>It's nice.</i>

01:27.074 --> 01:28.443
It's nice.
TIFFANIE: It is nice.

01:28.443 --> 01:29.780
<i>Do you think this week's</i>

01:29.780 --> 01:30.948
gonna be relaxing?

01:32.217 --> 01:33.821
SARI (chuckles):
Probably not.

01:33.821 --> 01:35.925
Good morning!

01:35.925 --> 01:37.428
Oh, everybody's
in pink today.

ASHLEE: <i>Are you guys still</i>

ALL:
No.

<i>Last week, Tiffanie's saying</i>

01:43.173 --> 01:45.410
<i>that her daughter's the leader,</i>
<i>her daughter's in charge,</i>

01:45.410 --> 01:46.647
<i>her daughter knows it best.</i>

01:46.647 --> 01:48.383
<i>Thank God Abby crowned Ari.</i>

01:48.383 --> 01:51.189
<i>That way, it shut Tiffanie up.</i>

01:51.189 --> 01:54.462
We need to act more like a team,
less drama,

01:54.462 --> 01:55.631
<i>and definitely win.</i>

01:55.631 --> 01:57.000
KERRI:

01:57.000 --> 01:58.571
<i>recognized for their win</i>
<i>this weekend,</i>

01:58.571 --> 02:02.277
because our girls won
and the elites didn't.

02:02.277 --> 02:04.549
STACEY: What'd you guys
think about the minis?

02:04.549 --> 02:06.653
JILL: Yeah, they were cute.
They're adorable.

02:06.653 --> 02:10.327
I'd like to see them
be stretched, yeah.

02:10.327 --> 02:11.329
JESSALYNN:
<i>It doesn't matter to me</i>

02:11.329 --> 02:13.199
what the eight‐year‐olds
are doing.

02:13.199 --> 02:15.003
<i>All they had</i>
<i>was the group number,</i>

02:15.003 --> 02:17.842
<i>but JoJo did great</i>
<i>in the Prince tribute.</i>

02:17.842 --> 02:20.882
And she did great
in her duo with Brynn.

02:20.882 --> 02:22.217
<i>I mean, I'm thinking</i>
<i>this is gonna be</i>

02:22.217 --> 02:23.921
<i>a great pyramid for JoJo.</i>

02:23.921 --> 02:25.525
ABBY LEE:
<i>Let's go. It's pyramid time.</i>

02:26.760 --> 02:28.029
HOLLY:
Thank you.

02:31.837 --> 02:32.939
All right!

02:32.939 --> 02:35.143
We did a group routine.

02:35.143 --> 02:36.914
We were second.

02:36.914 --> 02:39.251
We need to get
back on top.

02:39.251 --> 02:41.790
We had a mini team

02:41.790 --> 02:44.328
that won; they were
first overall.

02:44.328 --> 02:46.065
(girls cheering)

02:46.065 --> 02:49.873
I decided to switch it up
a little bit this week.

02:49.873 --> 02:51.777
I'm mixing up the
minis and the juniors

02:51.777 --> 02:53.514
on the pyramid,
all right?

02:53.514 --> 02:54.649
So, on the very bottom

02:54.649 --> 02:56.185
of the pyramid...

03:01.262 --> 03:03.801
...Alexus.

03:03.801 --> 03:05.003
Can I ask why?

03:05.003 --> 03:06.172
Why don't you look
in the mirror

03:06.172 --> 03:07.174
and ask yourself why.

03:07.174 --> 03:08.276
There's a thousand other people

03:08.276 --> 03:09.880
that would take your place
in a heartbeat.

03:09.880 --> 03:11.583
Well, you were all
in the same room.

03:11.583 --> 03:13.787
You weren't banished
to a room in the back.

03:13.787 --> 03:15.023
Open your mouth
and say one more word,

03:15.023 --> 03:16.894
and your kid's
not in that number.

03:17.896 --> 03:18.864
Next...

03:23.039 --> 03:24.910
...Peyton.

03:24.910 --> 03:26.813
In the choreography,

03:26.813 --> 03:30.420
<i>there's mistakes</i>
<i>that you are making.</i>

03:30.420 --> 03:32.725
And until you step up
to the plate,

03:32.725 --> 03:34.395
you're always gonna be
down here somewhere.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.036
Okay, next...

03:40.206 --> 03:42.144
...I have Nia.

03:42.144 --> 03:44.849
Nia, obviously you
weren't feeling well.

03:44.849 --> 03:46.185
You were ill.

03:46.185 --> 03:47.655
You were great
in the group.

03:47.655 --> 03:49.993
You didn't do the duet.

03:49.993 --> 03:51.329
Then we have...

03:52.832 --> 03:54.869
...JoJo.

03:57.642 --> 04:00.180
And... Brynn.

04:03.219 --> 04:04.689
<i>I didn't see emotion.</i>

04:04.689 --> 04:06.827
<i>I didn't see if,</i>
<i>when your hands went up,</i>

04:06.827 --> 04:08.196
<i>they were matched.</i>

04:10.100 --> 04:11.068
Okay, next,

04:11.068 --> 04:12.739
moving up the pyramid,

04:12.739 --> 04:15.644
we have Areana...

04:17.882 --> 04:19.853
...Lilliana...

04:23.259 --> 04:24.294
...Elliana.

04:25.798 --> 04:28.704
The "Anas," all right?

04:28.704 --> 04:31.042
I'm not gonna be below the minis
on a pyramid. This is stupid.

04:31.042 --> 04:32.411
They shook their ass

04:32.411 --> 04:34.314
in a bathing suit,
and they're on‐‐

04:34.314 --> 04:36.018
they're higher.
There's no way.

04:37.054 --> 04:40.460
You‐‐ I'm so mad.
No idea.

04:40.460 --> 04:42.532
First overall, and
she's on the bottom...

04:42.532 --> 04:43.934
They got first
in the preteen division.

04:43.934 --> 04:45.403
They weren't first overall.

04:45.403 --> 04:46.807
JESSALYNN: ...and she's on
the bottom of the pyramid?

04:46.807 --> 04:48.977
You are not gonna ruin her.
You're not gonna ruin her.

04:48.977 --> 04:50.346
ABBY LEE:
I wasn't trying to.

04:50.346 --> 04:52.284
JESSALYNN: Yes you are.
You're not gonna ruin her.

04:52.284 --> 04:53.554
You're taking this
way too serious.
No.

04:53.554 --> 04:55.156
I watched you sabotage
another dancer for years.

04:57.394 --> 04:58.329
It's not true.

04:58.329 --> 04:59.699
You're not gonna do it to JoJo.

05:01.536 --> 05:03.607
These girls did two numbers
that were

05:03.607 --> 05:05.410
full of choreography; they
learned how to do Prince,

05:05.410 --> 05:07.214
they learned
how to mirror each other.

05:07.214 --> 05:08.584
Those kids did

05:08.584 --> 05:09.919
a mini dance.

05:09.919 --> 05:11.523
I'm sorry, but it's true.

05:11.523 --> 05:13.059
ABBY LEE:
Last week,

05:13.059 --> 05:16.365
I hobbled out here,
just after knee surgery,

05:16.365 --> 05:18.436
and walk in, and
Jess is in here.

05:18.436 --> 05:19.639
I'm like, "Why
are you in here?"

05:19.639 --> 05:20.574
It's demeaning.

05:20.574 --> 05:22.477
So the real reason
is because Jess,

05:22.477 --> 05:23.914
not because of
how they danced.

05:23.914 --> 05:25.083
That what you're saying?

05:25.083 --> 05:26.418
In part, yes.

05:27.755 --> 05:30.561
JESSALYNN: <i>I am so pissed</i>
<i>at Abby right now.</i>

05:30.561 --> 05:33.767
<i>She has the nerve to put my kid</i>

05:33.767 --> 05:37.040
below those freakin' toddlers
on the pyramid

05:37.040 --> 05:39.011
because I stepped in,
helped her out,

05:39.011 --> 05:40.548
and did her job for her,

05:40.548 --> 05:43.319
<i>while Abby was in the audience</i>
<i>sitting on her ass,</i>

05:43.319 --> 05:45.490
<i>eating popcorn,</i>
<i>drinking a soda.</i>

05:45.490 --> 05:47.962
<i>If Abby is gonna drop the ball,</i>

05:47.962 --> 05:49.699
I'm stepping in.

05:49.699 --> 05:51.068
So, you guys...
I'm a dance teacher.

05:51.068 --> 05:52.304
I've had a studio my whole life.

05:52.304 --> 05:53.840
I'm not sitting
back anymore.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.410
We're gonna make
the most of this.

05:55.410 --> 05:56.513
Real mature, Abby.

05:56.513 --> 05:58.149
ABBY LEE:
Moving up the pyramid,

05:58.149 --> 05:59.552
we have Kalani.

06:01.055 --> 06:02.692
(girls giggle)
And Kendall.

06:02.692 --> 06:05.263
(girls whoop)

06:05.263 --> 06:07.067
KIRA: Why do we have
one pyramid though?

06:07.067 --> 06:08.604
'Cause we've had
the select team here...

06:08.604 --> 06:10.173
I don't even
get it, like...

06:10.173 --> 06:11.408
...different pyramids.

06:11.408 --> 06:13.312
AREANA: If they want us
to have our own pyramid,

06:13.312 --> 06:15.016
that's fine.

06:20.360 --> 06:23.499
ABBY LEE: <i>I am trying to teach</i>
<i>JoJo a lesson to work harder.</i>

06:23.499 --> 06:26.171
To practice more, to be better.

06:26.171 --> 06:28.309
<i>All the kids, but if it's gonna</i>
<i>be that big of a deal,</i>

06:28.309 --> 06:30.179
<i>if Jess can't handle it</i>

06:30.179 --> 06:32.985
<i>and she's just gonna disrupt</i>
<i>my pyramid session, then fine.</i>

06:32.985 --> 06:35.791
Going forward, there will be
two separate pyramids.

06:35.791 --> 06:37.127
KIRA:
That makes sense.

06:38.997 --> 06:39.999
ABBY LEE:
All right.

06:39.999 --> 06:41.870
This week,

06:41.870 --> 06:43.406
we're going to
a competition called

06:43.406 --> 06:46.613
FIERCE National
Dance Competition.

06:46.613 --> 06:49.084
We are traveling to
Phoenix, Arizona.

06:49.084 --> 06:51.488
(girls cheering)

06:53.560 --> 06:54.996
Home of these two.

06:56.465 --> 06:58.369
Our hometown girls.

06:59.872 --> 07:00.741
You're doing duets.

07:00.741 --> 07:02.945
(girls cheering)

07:02.945 --> 07:05.651
And the title is

07:05.651 --> 07:08.155
"Prettier Than Poison."

07:08.155 --> 07:09.491
(girls oohing)

07:10.493 --> 07:12.832
We have another duet.

07:15.470 --> 07:16.338
Nia.

07:18.543 --> 07:19.378
Kendall.

07:20.246 --> 07:21.816
You're doing your duet

07:21.816 --> 07:24.287
from last week.

07:24.287 --> 07:25.289
You're pop stars.

07:27.060 --> 07:30.501
But I still don't think
that you are bigger

07:30.501 --> 07:33.640
than Beyoncé or you
are greater than Gaga.

07:33.640 --> 07:36.546
I want the people to be wowed.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.317
Okay.

07:39.317 --> 07:40.954
This is a very

07:40.954 --> 07:42.825
emotional week.

07:42.825 --> 07:44.862
For many of us, I'm sure.

07:46.265 --> 07:47.267
It's Mother's Day.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.904
You know, I would give

07:48.904 --> 07:51.275
everything to be able to spend

07:51.275 --> 07:54.448
one more Mother's Day
with my mom.

07:54.448 --> 07:56.051
Uh, that's not possible.

07:57.955 --> 07:59.090
<i>I think that everybody</i>

07:59.090 --> 08:02.497
who has a mom that passed away

08:02.497 --> 08:04.134
has that longing

08:04.134 --> 08:05.169
<i>to see them again.</i>

08:05.169 --> 08:06.405
<i>My mother,</i>

08:06.405 --> 08:10.681
she is the founding mother
of our dance studio.

08:10.681 --> 08:11.816
Hi, Mom.

08:11.816 --> 08:14.187
Hi, Abby. How are you?
How are... Good, good.

08:14.187 --> 08:15.657
How are you?

08:15.657 --> 08:17.695
Good. Hi, dear.
You're up and at it.

08:17.695 --> 08:19.197
Hello. How are you?

08:19.197 --> 08:22.036
She was so... wonderful.

08:22.036 --> 08:23.607
<i>And when your mom's alive,</i>

08:23.607 --> 08:25.443
you take her for granted.

08:25.443 --> 08:27.413
<i>I know I did.</i>

08:29.719 --> 08:31.723
Girls, as mad as you get
at your moms,

08:31.723 --> 08:33.292
they deserve...

08:33.292 --> 08:35.831
the utmost respect

08:35.831 --> 08:37.668
from you.

08:37.668 --> 08:39.271
Not from me,
'cause they're not my mother.

08:39.271 --> 08:40.841
Uh...

08:40.841 --> 08:42.110
Mini group.

08:42.110 --> 08:44.147
You will be performing

08:44.147 --> 08:46.285
a lyrical routine.

08:46.285 --> 08:49.692
(cheering)

08:49.692 --> 08:53.934
And the name of your routine is
"Wait for Me, Mom."

08:55.904 --> 08:58.108
<i>We're gonna do one of those</i>
<i>lyrical routines</i>

34:27.163 --> 34:29.067
And I am shocked that
Abby's okay with this.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.470
KERRI:
We pissed them off.

34:30.470 --> 34:32.007
Us being here,

34:32.007 --> 34:33.610
us getting the lyrical,

34:33.610 --> 34:35.814
our girls walking with Abby
in the...

34:35.814 --> 34:37.918
We get under their skin.

34:37.918 --> 34:39.822
YOLANDA: It wasn't
always like this though.

34:39.822 --> 34:41.960
I think, as our girls get
stronger and stronger,

34:41.960 --> 34:45.166
and‐and closer as a team,
then it's like, wow.

34:45.166 --> 34:46.603
They would not be
this bothered

34:46.603 --> 34:48.372
to this extreme
if they were not threatened.

34:50.410 --> 34:51.546
ASHLEE:
I felt like this week was

34:51.546 --> 34:53.416
a little bit of a fight
for us, but not like

34:53.416 --> 34:55.721
in the normal sense of the word
where we fight with each other.

34:55.721 --> 34:57.490
It was a fight to kind of
just get something together.

34:57.490 --> 34:58.694
HOLLY:
And we don't

34:58.694 --> 34:59.595
want to fight.

34:59.595 --> 35:00.898
Like, on a practical
side, Abby,

35:00.898 --> 35:03.402
do you really want to spend
six to eight hours a week

35:03.402 --> 35:04.539
on one dance?

35:04.539 --> 35:05.808
Like, that...
and that's what happened

35:05.808 --> 35:06.810
this week.

35:06.810 --> 35:08.112
You know, that...

35:08.112 --> 35:09.782
You were concerned that
it wasn't gonna look good

35:09.782 --> 35:12.521
and you were in there
constantly.

35:12.521 --> 35:14.291
I'm gonna say this.
You'll be mad.

35:14.291 --> 35:15.627
Your infatuation...

35:15.627 --> 35:17.030
you're infatuated
with those little kids.

35:17.030 --> 35:18.867
I'm not infatuated with them.
But, see, I think you are.

35:18.867 --> 35:21.573
You want to see what you can
do with them and that's great,

35:21.573 --> 35:23.008
but that doesn't do our kids‐‐

35:23.008 --> 35:25.514
like, they missed out
this week because of that.

35:25.514 --> 35:27.718
ASHLEE: They implied that
we were afraid to dance

35:27.718 --> 35:28.887
against their eight‐year‐olds.

35:28.887 --> 35:30.089
Right.
That's what they
were implying.

35:30.089 --> 35:31.860
Over and over and over
again, they implied that.

35:31.860 --> 35:33.530
Did you look at the faces
on some of those kids?

35:33.530 --> 35:34.732
Don't worry about it. (chuckles)

35:34.732 --> 35:35.734
I still don't even
remember their names.

35:35.734 --> 35:36.669
JILL:
No.

35:36.669 --> 35:37.738
Ana.

35:37.738 --> 35:39.542
There's not an Ana
on that team.

35:39.542 --> 35:40.376
They're all "Ana."

35:40.376 --> 35:41.445
Yeah, they are.
Oh.

35:41.445 --> 35:42.815
(laughter)

35:42.815 --> 35:44.484
Lilliana, Areana...

35:44.484 --> 35:46.288
I think that's why
Gianna isn't here,

35:46.288 --> 35:49.094
'cause she's confused about
where she's supposed to be.

35:49.094 --> 35:50.531
(laughter)

35:51.465 --> 35:53.068
Ooh.

35:53.068 --> 35:54.605
Those are pretty.

35:55.941 --> 35:57.845
JILL: You guys look
like Wonder Woman.

35:57.845 --> 36:00.049
I know.
Hey, I am
Wonder Woman.

36:00.049 --> 36:01.619
You know...
They look so beautiful.

36:01.619 --> 36:02.521
Beautiful costume.
Can you...

36:02.521 --> 36:03.957
KIRA:
Is that a snake?

36:03.957 --> 36:05.594
Yes, there's a snake in my head.

36:05.594 --> 36:06.663
ASHLEE:
I hope people get

36:06.663 --> 36:08.733
that those are
snakes in their hair.

36:08.733 --> 36:09.769
I thought they were
having things

36:09.769 --> 36:11.138
wrapped around their arms.

36:11.138 --> 36:12.842
ASHLEE: It's fine.
At this point,

36:12.842 --> 36:13.877
we've got, like,
ten minutes.

36:13.877 --> 36:16.148
Just got to leave it.

36:16.148 --> 36:18.553
This is it. (laughs)

36:19.655 --> 36:21.158
I think we got the short end

36:21.158 --> 36:22.728
of the stick this week.

36:22.728 --> 36:25.066
<i>The duets are under a lot of</i>
<i>pressure, and Nia and Kendall</i>

36:25.066 --> 36:27.370
<i>need to prove themselves</i>
<i>to Abby,</i>

36:27.370 --> 36:29.542
<i>'cause last time</i>
<i>they did a duet together,</i>

36:29.542 --> 36:31.880
<i>it did not work out.</i>

36:31.880 --> 36:35.152
But it's so important for Kalani
and Brynn to pull out a win.

36:35.152 --> 36:38.727
<i>Kalani has a reputation</i>
<i>to uphold in her hometown.</i>

36:38.727 --> 36:42.635
These girls should've came in
with this elaborate makeup...

36:42.635 --> 36:45.239
and their arms painted and...

36:45.239 --> 36:46.776
<i>These girls deserve</i>

36:46.776 --> 36:48.312

<i>and we're gonna</i>

36:50.049 --> 36:52.521
support the juniors
and their duos, right?

36:52.521 --> 36:56.796
And they're amazing, and I want
you girls to look up to them.

36:56.796 --> 36:59.835
Right? Even if they don't
always want‐want us here.

36:59.835 --> 37:02.006
We're gonna be supportive
and show Abby

37:02.006 --> 37:04.879
that that's why we're here
and to support the entire ALDC.

37:04.879 --> 37:06.749
Okay, let's go, girls.
You ready?

37:06.749 --> 37:07.751
Yeah.

come on up here, let's go.

38:15.954 --> 38:17.090
All right, listen.

38:17.090 --> 38:18.726
You step out
on that stage,

38:18.726 --> 38:20.463
they're gonna judge you
on that kick, on that leap,

38:20.463 --> 38:21.833
on that turn.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.570
They're gonna judge you
on partner work

38:23.570 --> 38:24.605
because you're
doing a duet.

38:24.605 --> 38:25.574
You two are

38:25.574 --> 38:27.845
two independent pop stars.

38:27.845 --> 38:30.382
You're not
Sonny and Cher.

38:30.382 --> 38:31.485
"Prettier Than Poison."

38:31.485 --> 38:32.487
So you need

38:32.487 --> 38:34.525
to be evil, you need to be dark.

38:34.525 --> 38:36.863
You need to be poisonous,
but you need to stay beautiful.

38:36.863 --> 38:39.300
That means your lines,
your movements.

38:39.300 --> 38:41.338
You're enticing.

38:41.338 --> 38:43.743
People want to come closer
to you, but then you're gonna

38:43.743 --> 38:44.812

38:44.812 --> 38:46.081
All right?

38:46.081 --> 38:47.951

38:57.270 --> 38:58.272

it's a big deal

38:58.272 --> 38:59.240
to look good

Oh, it's just...

44:25.258 --> 44:27.764
my daughter's seven years old.

44:27.764 --> 44:29.768
She's been idolizing
these girls since

44:29.768 --> 44:31.204
she's probably two.

44:31.204 --> 44:33.576
And then she goes in to wish
them good luck, and the girls

44:33.576 --> 44:34.978
are rude to her.

44:34.978 --> 44:37.149
That makes me sick to my
stomach. That's wrong.

44:39.186 --> 44:40.556

are being mean to your

44:47.904 --> 44:49.941
I am not playing that game.
No.

44:51.778 --> 44:53.716
JILL: Right. What‐what
constitutes being mean?

44:53.716 --> 44:55.452
ASHLEE: Exactly.
Staying focused and
getting their dance done?

44:55.452 --> 44:57.189
They're trying to get
ready to do their duo,

44:57.189 --> 44:58.559
and so they're not
paying attention to them,

44:58.559 --> 44:59.527
and that's mean?
JILL: Right.

44:59.527 --> 45:00.462
KIRA:
It's not their job.

45:00.462 --> 45:02.032
No.
Their job is
to come here,

45:02.032 --> 45:03.769
focus,
learn their group routine,

45:03.769 --> 45:05.438
learn their duets,

45:05.438 --> 45:07.510
and go on stage
and look fabulous.

45:08.612 --> 45:10.816

STACEY: I'm sorry, wh...
No, because

45:19.400 --> 45:22.372
you walked away within,
like, 30 seconds.
You know what?

45:22.372 --> 45:25.045
You are a doctor. You're ruining
your practice right now.

45:25.045 --> 45:26.380

No. I'm not afraid of you.
Yes. That's good.

Kindly leave! Really.
We've had it with you.

45:38.772 --> 45:40.375
This is embarrassing.
JILL: They can stay here.
They can...

45:40.375 --> 45:41.912
Let them have it.
Then let's go.
You're right.

45:41.912 --> 45:43.114

disparaging remarks about

1:00:53.634 --> 1:00:55.538
our team.

1:00:55.538 --> 1:00:58.510
I think our kids'
actions speak loudly.

1:00:58.510 --> 1:01:00.815
They've been doing this for

1:01:00.815 --> 1:01:02.450
hundreds of weeks.

1:01:02.450 --> 1:01:04.589
Child to child,
the children don't have issues

1:01:04.589 --> 1:01:06.593
with each other.
Right.

1:01:06.593 --> 1:01:08.797
And we've had lots of kids
coming and going,

1:01:08.797 --> 1:01:10.066
visiting the team.

1:01:10.066 --> 1:01:11.135

1:01:11.135 --> 1:01:12.705
an instance
where a guest

1:01:12.705 --> 1:01:14.274
said anything negative

1:01:14.274 --> 1:01:16.145
about the way our girls
have treated them?

1:01:16.145 --> 1:01:17.648
ABBY LEE:
No.

1:01:20.855 --> 1:01:23.092
Different kids
have come in. Uh...

1:01:23.092 --> 1:01:27.902
They are so... overwhelmed

1:01:27.902 --> 1:01:31.342
to even be sharing the
stage with our kids.

1:01:31.342 --> 1:01:34.849
And my point is
that shows you the intent.

1:01:34.849 --> 1:01:37.287
Their intent is to
take our girls down.

1:01:37.287 --> 1:01:38.322
Their intent is

1:01:38.322 --> 1:01:41.796
not to share the stage
with our girls.

1:01:41.796 --> 1:01:43.867
And you've allowed it to happen.
"You're the next generation.

1:01:43.867 --> 1:01:45.436
"They're washed up.
You're coming in.

1:01:45.436 --> 1:01:46.606
You're taking their place."

1:01:46.606 --> 1:01:47.875
HOLLY: And your
actions show that.

1:01:47.875 --> 1:01:49.512
KIRA:
I think by... but, Abby,

1:01:49.512 --> 1:01:52.484
by how much time you spent
with them this week,

1:01:52.484 --> 1:01:54.722
and how little time
you spent with our girls,

1:01:54.722 --> 1:01:56.559
you just gave them

1:01:56.559 --> 1:01:58.997
so much power over us.

1:01:58.997 --> 1:02:01.068
We have an improv dance, because
we don't have a group dance.

1:02:01.068 --> 1:02:02.838
No, you had a group dance.

1:02:02.838 --> 1:02:04.976
But it was not good enough.
It was not... No.

1:02:04.976 --> 1:02:06.312
KIRA: Abby, that
group dance was not

1:02:06.312 --> 1:02:07.815
putting your best foot forward.

1:02:07.815 --> 1:02:10.554
That group dance was not,
"I want these girls

1:02:10.554 --> 1:02:12.424
to shine on stage."

1:02:12.424 --> 1:02:14.227
That group dance
was thrown together

1:02:14.227 --> 1:02:15.597
in 30 minutes.

1:02:15.597 --> 1:02:17.467
Those minis had three hours.

1:02:17.467 --> 1:02:19.471
JESSALYNN: Here's the thing‐‐
what's done is done.

1:02:19.471 --> 1:02:21.543
We can't go back
and redo the week.

1:02:21.543 --> 1:02:22.778
The week is said and done.

1:02:22.778 --> 1:02:25.617
The dance is said and done,
but we need to know

1:02:25.617 --> 1:02:26.987
where you stand,

1:02:26.987 --> 1:02:29.224
because your
behavior right now

1:02:29.224 --> 1:02:30.928
is gonna decide
what we do next week.

1:02:30.928 --> 1:02:33.332
Well, my behavior is
what I choose it to be.
So, if you don't care...

1:02:33.332 --> 1:02:35.370
I'm a grown adult
and I can do whatever I want.
That's fine.

1:02:35.370 --> 1:02:36.940
Then the writing is on the wall.

1:02:36.940 --> 1:02:38.543
No, the writing is
not on the wall.

1:02:38.543 --> 1:02:40.113
We need to know where you stand.

1:02:42.718 --> 1:02:44.054
KIRA:
I'm not gonna let...

1:02:44.054 --> 1:02:46.191
JESSALYNN: This is not
happening again next week.
No.

1:02:46.191 --> 1:02:48.262
I am not letting a bunch of
mothers of seven‐year‐olds

1:02:48.262 --> 1:02:50.667
come in here and
degrade our children.

1:02:50.667 --> 1:02:52.905
So you're either on our ship
or on that ship.

1:02:52.905 --> 1:02:55.243
ABBY LEE:
<i>This week was very difficult</i>

1:02:55.243 --> 1:02:57.414
<i>and very emotional for me.</i>

1:02:57.414 --> 1:02:58.449
<i>Now the mothers are</i>

1:02:58.449 --> 1:02:59.752
giving me this ultimatum.

1:02:59.752 --> 1:03:01.488
<i>They have no idea</i>
<i>what I'm going through.</i>

1:03:01.488 --> 1:03:02.658
<i>They should be afraid</i>

1:03:02.658 --> 1:03:03.860
of the consequences.

1:03:03.860 --> 1:03:05.363
If you don't want to work
with our kids,

1:03:05.363 --> 1:03:07.200
say the words.
ABBY LEE: Okay.

1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:08.804
Be careful what
you wish for.

1:03:12.077 --> 1:03:13.680
ABBY LEE:
<i>Next on</i> Dance Moms...

1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:14.882
Is this the end
of the road?

1:03:14.882 --> 1:03:16.185
Is this the end of the road
for me?

1:03:16.185 --> 1:03:19.324
Is this the end of the
road for all of you?

1:03:19.324 --> 1:03:20.894
We're going into battle.

1:03:20.894 --> 1:03:23.099
<i>The elite team moms</i>
<i>don't want us here.</i>

1:03:23.099 --> 1:03:24.535
Get your money back
for that PhD, sweetie.

1:03:24.535 --> 1:03:25.671
Okay.

1:03:25.671 --> 1:03:27.073
Get out!

1:03:27.073 --> 1:03:29.077
Mind your business, Mom.

1:03:29.077 --> 1:03:31.549
Whoever the highest
placing duet

1:03:31.549 --> 1:03:33.219
<i>will have a solo next week.</i>

1:03:33.219 --> 1:03:35.189
KIRA:
<i>There has not been a solo</i>

1:03:35.189 --> 1:03:37.093
given out this season yet;
it should clearly go

1:03:37.093 --> 1:03:38.797
<i>to one of the junior kids.</i>

1:03:38.797 --> 1:03:40.399
HOLLY: <i>Yeah, she just</i>
<i>kind of leapfrogged over</i>

1:03:40.399 --> 1:03:42.621
pretty much everyone
on the team.
