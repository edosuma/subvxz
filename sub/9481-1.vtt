00:53.650 --> 00:55.150
1-nil!

00:55.151 --> 00:57.166
Coming in, number 2!

01:01.532 --> 01:03.761
This is what's wrong with the play.

01:04.953 --> 01:07.371
Bye-bye, Hunter.

01:07.372 --> 01:08.580
Bremner!

01:08.581 --> 01:10.707
So it's sheer bedlam.

01:10.708 --> 01:11.958
Oh, dear.

01:11.960 --> 01:14.336
And now what?
More trouble off the ball.

01:14.337 --> 01:16.629
This match has been riddled
with free kicks...

01:16.631 --> 01:18.694
from the start.

01:18.883 --> 01:20.649
Leeds have got
what they deserved.

01:21.886 --> 01:23.553
They've taken the FA Cup
for the first time.

01:23.555 --> 01:26.723
Domarski coming up square,
number 10.

01:26.725 --> 01:30.994
And it's there. And England
are out of the World Cup.

01:33.023 --> 01:36.913
The end of an era, Sir Alf Ramsey.

01:39.112 --> 01:42.030
What sort of manager
is the FA now looking for?

01:42.032 --> 01:44.074
I presume a new... A young...

01:44.076 --> 01:48.845
With perhaps new ideas
and a track-suited manager.

02:04.889 --> 02:06.869
Thank you.

02:16.151 --> 02:18.485
I'm just gonna make
a brief statement.

02:18.487 --> 02:22.072
Yesterday afternoon at 3:00...

02:22.074 --> 02:24.283
I accepted the FA's offer
to become...

02:24.284 --> 02:27.889
the next manager of the
England national football team.

02:29.373 --> 02:33.292
Now, obviously, this involves me
leaving Leeds United...

02:33.293 --> 02:35.961
after 13 happy and successful years...

02:35.963 --> 02:38.523
which makes me very sad.

02:39.633 --> 02:43.469
I'd like to think
I built the club into a family.

02:43.470 --> 02:46.778
Now, there must be sadness
when anyone leaves a family.

02:47.099 --> 02:48.474
However...

02:48.475 --> 02:52.352
when one man leaves,
another steps into his place.

02:52.354 --> 02:54.813
I know who I think
that person should be...

02:54.815 --> 02:56.941
the man to replace me.

02:56.942 --> 03:01.626
And I have made my feelings clear
to the board of directors.

03:02.490 --> 03:04.991
Thank you. No further comments.

03:04.992 --> 03:06.951
- Someone from the team?
- Billy Bremner?

03:06.952 --> 03:09.578
Is it someone
from Leeds' team, Mr. Revie?

03:09.580 --> 03:11.455
- Give us a name, Mr. Revie.
- Giles?

03:11.457 --> 03:13.805
- Is it Johnny Giles?
- Is it Johnny Giles?

03:14.085 --> 03:17.441
Can you give us a name, Mr. Revie?
Can you give us a name?

03:53.709 --> 03:57.515
- When are we there?
- Any moment now. On the right.

04:01.634 --> 04:03.649
- There it is!
- It's there, Dad!

04:10.101 --> 04:11.392
Where are you going?

04:11.394 --> 04:12.602
- Brian!
- Brian!

04:12.603 --> 04:13.894
Stop!

04:13.896 --> 04:16.355
- Dad?
- You missed it.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.440
There's something else to do first.

04:18.442 --> 04:20.209
It won't take long.

04:23.364 --> 04:26.908
We welcome Brian Clough who starts
his job as manager of Leeds United...

04:26.910 --> 04:28.535
taking over from Don Revie...

04:28.536 --> 04:30.995
the most successful manager
in club history...

04:30.997 --> 04:34.499
- under whom Leeds won everything.
- Not quite everything.

04:34.501 --> 04:36.418
Not won the European Cup.

04:36.419 --> 04:38.169
But pretty much everything else.

04:38.171 --> 04:41.298
- Daunted?
- Daunted? Not at all, Austin.

04:41.299 --> 04:42.757
Looking forward to it.

04:42.759 --> 04:45.093
The biggest challenge of your life...

04:45.095 --> 04:47.930
and you'll be without Peter Taylor
for the first time...

04:47.931 --> 04:51.266
- a lifelong professional colleague.
- Yes, Pete's at Brighton now.

04:51.268 --> 04:53.227
He had the opportunity
to come with me.

04:53.228 --> 04:57.105
But Brighton was his choice,
Leeds was mine.

04:57.107 --> 04:59.066
A surprising choice,
some might say...

04:59.067 --> 05:00.942
because you've been very vocal...

05:00.944 --> 05:03.111
in your criticism of them
over the years.

05:03.113 --> 05:04.321
I have.

05:04.323 --> 05:06.574
You've accused the players
of dirty tactics...

05:06.575 --> 05:09.201
cheating, dissent, foul play.

05:09.202 --> 05:12.162
You've called Norman Hunter
Norman "Bites Yer Legs" Hunter.

05:12.164 --> 05:14.623
Peter Lorimer falls
when no one touches him.

05:14.625 --> 05:16.792
- And I was right.
- But I'm curious.

05:16.794 --> 05:19.378
Why do you now show such alacrity
to joining them...

05:19.379 --> 05:22.464
after such vituperative criticism
of them for so long?

05:22.466 --> 05:26.428
Goodness. It will take me half an hour
to explain all those words for a start.

05:26.429 --> 05:31.141
Football is a beautiful game, Austin.

05:31.142 --> 05:33.226
It needs to be played beautifully.

05:33.228 --> 05:35.395
I think Leeds
have sold themselves short.

05:35.397 --> 05:38.816
They've been champions,
but they've not been good champions.

05:38.817 --> 05:42.110
In the sense of wearing the crown well.
They've not been loved.

05:42.112 --> 05:47.282
But then, you know,
that's hardly surprising given...

05:47.284 --> 05:50.327
the type of operation
that's been in place there.

05:50.329 --> 05:53.664
"That type of operation"? I presume
you're referring to Don Revie...

05:53.665 --> 05:56.500
who has long been regarded
as a father figure in Leeds.

05:56.501 --> 05:58.543
Now you're coming in
as the outsider...

05:58.545 --> 06:01.672
the enemy, even, after all the things
you've said in public.

06:01.673 --> 06:04.675
Coming in and taking over
as a stepfather.

06:04.676 --> 06:07.439
Wouldn't you expect some degree
of resentment to this?

06:07.638 --> 06:09.680
I would accept...

06:09.682 --> 06:12.975
and expect a strangeness...

06:12.977 --> 06:14.477
initially.

06:14.478 --> 06:16.228
Perfectly normal.

06:16.230 --> 06:20.816
But it won't be long before they realise
I'm a fair man...

06:20.818 --> 06:22.944
a kind man.

06:22.945 --> 06:24.779
I'm a warm man.

06:24.780 --> 06:26.363
And maybe under me...

06:26.365 --> 06:30.493
they can experience what it's like
to be in a happy family after all.

06:30.494 --> 06:33.913
But how can you be sure
they weren't happy with Don all along?

06:33.914 --> 06:38.267
Well, they wouldn't have played
football that way if they were happy.

06:56.396 --> 06:59.064
- Brian!
- Brian!

06:59.065 --> 07:00.315
- Brian!
- Brian!

07:00.316 --> 07:01.941
Hey, get out of the way!

07:01.943 --> 07:03.735
Now, out you go, lads.

07:03.736 --> 07:06.946
Where have you been? The directors
been waiting for over an hour.

07:06.948 --> 07:09.378
Brian, what's it like to be at Leeds?

07:10.910 --> 07:12.745
It's a pleasure to be here...

07:12.747 --> 07:14.914
and I'm looking forward
to a very good...

07:14.915 --> 07:17.958
long-lasting relationship
with Leeds United.

07:17.960 --> 07:20.670
There you go, young man.
Thanks very much.

07:20.671 --> 07:24.173
Will Peter Taylor be joining you
at Leeds, Mr. Clough?

07:24.175 --> 07:26.259
Wait there a second.

07:26.260 --> 07:28.987
- Wait here a minute.
- Morning, lads.

07:31.891 --> 07:33.766
Lovely Yorkshire weather.

07:33.768 --> 07:37.574
It makes me wanna jump on a plane
right back to Majorca.

07:43.194 --> 07:44.444
Thank you very much.

07:44.445 --> 07:46.612
There are very important people
waiting.

07:46.614 --> 07:47.947
Can't keep them waiting.

07:47.949 --> 07:49.616
Not much of a welcome, is it?

07:49.617 --> 07:53.036
- Not a smile from Johnny Giles.
- You're 5 days late.

07:53.037 --> 07:56.891
And did you really have to say that
about Majorca?

07:57.834 --> 08:00.418
He was Revie's first choice
to get your job.

08:00.420 --> 08:03.432
- Who? Johnny Giles?
- Aye.

08:03.965 --> 08:06.277
Was he now?

08:06.509 --> 08:08.468
And Bremner?

08:08.470 --> 08:09.887
Club captain.

08:09.888 --> 08:12.781
Don's son and heir.

08:13.350 --> 08:16.279
You'll never get any love out of him.

08:16.478 --> 08:18.937
- Great.
- Come on, boys.

08:18.939 --> 08:22.149
Here's to happy fucking families.

08:22.150 --> 08:23.733
It should be just round here.

08:23.735 --> 08:26.945
I want you two to behave for
your elderly Uncle Jimmy, all right?

08:26.947 --> 08:28.364
- See you.
- Come in, Brian.

08:28.365 --> 08:30.084
Sit down there, lads.

08:35.414 --> 08:38.332
What?
No one gonna offer me a drink?

08:38.332 --> 08:40.134
Like an undertaker's in here.

08:41.753 --> 08:43.982
Why did you do it?

08:44.131 --> 08:45.673
Do what?

08:45.674 --> 08:49.480
The interview
for Yorkshire Television.

08:50.095 --> 08:51.762
We've had a phone call.

08:51.764 --> 08:54.599
Not so much a phone call,
more a bloody tirade.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.017
From Don.

08:56.018 --> 08:58.781
He quoted
some of the things you said.

08:59.230 --> 09:03.335
"How unhappy the players were
under him."

09:04.444 --> 09:06.625
"What bad champions."

09:07.364 --> 09:09.990
- Looking for the response.
- Bloody got one as well.

09:09.991 --> 09:12.701
- He's gone berserk.
- He had it coming.

09:12.703 --> 09:15.538
He shouldn't have done that piece
in the Mirror about me.

09:15.539 --> 09:18.207
Saying he thought
I was a daft choice.

09:18.208 --> 09:21.210
- Well, he's entitled to his opinions.
- I'm entitled to mine.

09:21.211 --> 09:24.519
And I'm entitled to mine.

09:28.010 --> 09:29.510
I hired you to do this job...

09:29.511 --> 09:32.304
because you're the best
young manager in this country.

09:32.306 --> 09:34.932
Thank you. I'm the best old one too.

09:34.933 --> 09:36.767
I also did it...

09:36.769 --> 09:38.352
under the assumption...

09:38.354 --> 09:41.898
that you would be coming here
wanting the best for this club.

09:41.899 --> 09:44.191
For the city of Leeds.

09:44.193 --> 09:47.570
So why do I get the feeling
this is all about you and Don?

09:47.571 --> 09:50.281
Of course it's just about me and Don.

09:50.282 --> 09:52.032
Always has been.

09:52.034 --> 09:55.619
But instead of putting frowns
on your foreheads...

09:55.621 --> 10:00.166
you elders of Leeds in your blazers
and your brass-fucking-buttons...

10:00.167 --> 10:04.628
it should put big white Colgate
smiles on your big white faces.

10:04.630 --> 10:08.841
Because it means
I won't eat, and won't sleep...

10:08.843 --> 10:12.971
until I've taken whatever
that man's achieved, and beaten it.

10:12.972 --> 10:16.766
Beaten it so I never have to hear
the name Don-fucking-Revie again.

10:16.768 --> 10:17.976
Beat it.

10:17.977 --> 10:21.312
The only name anyone sings
in the Yorkshire ale houses...

10:21.314 --> 10:24.524
raising their stinking jars
to their stinking mouths...

10:24.525 --> 10:26.901
is Brian Clough.

10:26.903 --> 10:31.089
Brian Clough uber-fucking-alles.

10:34.202 --> 10:36.632
Understand?

11:00.730 --> 11:02.605
Number 25.

11:02.607 --> 11:05.370
Manchester United...

11:07.612 --> 11:09.904
Number 41.

11:09.906 --> 11:13.000
- Will play Tottenham Hotspur.

11:13.493 --> 11:16.661
- Number 22.
- Come on, Pete.

11:16.663 --> 11:19.790
- Derby County...
- Derby County, second division.

11:19.791 --> 11:22.305
Here we go, that's us.

11:22.419 --> 11:24.253
- Will play...

11:24.254 --> 11:28.298
- number 6, Leeds United.
- Against the mighty...

11:28.299 --> 11:29.841
- Leeds!
- Leeds!

11:29.843 --> 11:31.343
Leeds! Good God!

11:31.344 --> 11:33.656
Don Revie's Leeds!

11:34.848 --> 11:36.848
- Don Revie's Leeds
- I don't believe it.

11:36.850 --> 11:41.036
Top of Division 1, here we come!

11:42.105 --> 11:44.523
What do you say to that,
Mr. Chairman?

11:44.524 --> 11:47.108
I can hear the cash registers now.

11:47.110 --> 11:50.278
Happy days, sir! Happy days!

11:50.280 --> 11:51.863
You've done well, Brian.

11:51.865 --> 11:54.157
Take your family out for a meal.

11:54.159 --> 11:57.035
Go to the Mumtaz.
Tell them it's on me.

11:57.037 --> 12:00.039
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

12:00.040 --> 12:03.333
Put the fish and chips in the bin.
Tonight's on Uncle Sam.

12:03.335 --> 12:07.106
We're going posh.
Chicken bhuna in town!

12:10.551 --> 12:14.345
Come on, Simon. Get your gloves,
Simon. Get your coat on.

12:14.346 --> 12:17.619
- Leeds United!
- Leeds!

12:21.228 --> 12:24.396
Right, you two, I want Billy Bremner
and Johnny Giles...

12:24.398 --> 12:26.065
to be able to read that.

12:26.066 --> 12:27.785
Come on.

12:32.907 --> 12:37.723
And this door has gotta be fit
for Donald Revie to walk through.

12:40.082 --> 12:42.346
Well, chop-chop.

12:48.173 --> 12:49.840
There you are. Right, ladies.

12:49.842 --> 12:52.802
Spick-and-span, remember.
Wash these walls down.

12:52.803 --> 12:56.360
Give the floors a proper polish.
I'll be back! Come on, off you go!

12:58.851 --> 13:01.018
I want it perfect.

13:01.020 --> 13:04.079
Like a fucking carpet.

13:04.273 --> 13:07.066
We've got proper footballers
coming...

13:07.067 --> 13:09.318
who know how to keep the ball
on the deck.

13:09.320 --> 13:12.711
Well, you can't fucking train
on it then.

13:23.417 --> 13:26.096
What a joker.

13:27.463 --> 13:29.755
Come on, Kev,
keep on your man. Pass it!

13:29.757 --> 13:31.090
Yeah, yeah, again. Again.

13:31.092 --> 13:33.593
You know,
he'll be making a file on us.

13:33.594 --> 13:35.011
A dossier.

13:35.012 --> 13:37.638
- Who?
- Don Revie.

13:37.640 --> 13:39.891
Prepares a file on every game.

13:39.892 --> 13:42.143
Leaves nothing to chance.

13:42.145 --> 13:46.366
Knows every opponent's formations,
strategies, everything.

13:46.482 --> 13:49.079
I've heard he's a superstitious twat.

13:49.110 --> 13:51.945
We grew up just a few streets apart
in Middlesbrough...

13:51.946 --> 13:53.780
close to Ayresome Park.

13:53.781 --> 13:57.450
He'll have known my street,
Valley Road.

13:57.452 --> 14:00.745
Probably bought sweets from Garnett's
factory where me dad worked.

14:00.747 --> 14:03.623
I heard he wears the same suit
to every game.

14:03.625 --> 14:06.139
His lucky blue suit.

14:06.252 --> 14:09.170
Best manager in the country,
Don Revie.

14:09.172 --> 14:11.882
Played for Sunderland, like me.

14:11.883 --> 14:13.842
A centre forward like me.

14:13.843 --> 14:17.178
- And England like me.
- Give it and go!

14:17.180 --> 14:20.109
Peas in a pod, me and Don.

14:20.642 --> 14:22.267
2 peas in a bloody pod.

14:22.269 --> 14:25.162
Right, you saw that?
That's the way you do it!

15:58.617 --> 16:00.632
They're here.

16:01.537 --> 16:04.264
Well, almost.

16:07.293 --> 16:08.710
Pass it!

16:08.711 --> 16:10.810
Move!

16:15.969 --> 16:19.693
I want Billy to sign
my autograph book.

16:24.979 --> 16:26.854
What are they doing?

16:26.855 --> 16:28.397
Ran out of petrol, boss.

16:28.399 --> 16:29.857
No.

16:29.858 --> 16:32.109
It's that superstition, ain't it?

16:32.111 --> 16:33.820
Every away Cup tie...

16:33.821 --> 16:36.614
Revie makes them walk
the last hundred yards.

16:36.615 --> 16:39.045
Soppy twat.

16:46.375 --> 16:48.141
Billy!

16:59.263 --> 17:01.055
- Billy! Billy!
- How are you doing there?

17:01.057 --> 17:02.741
All right?

17:03.601 --> 17:05.476
All right?

17:05.478 --> 17:08.490
Mr. Giles, quick picture!

17:08.564 --> 17:10.993
Mr. Revie!

17:15.070 --> 17:18.823
Welcome to Derby, Don.
A pleasure to meet you.

17:18.825 --> 17:21.117
I'm... I'm Brian Clough.

17:21.118 --> 17:24.213
Hello. Yeah, hello, hello.

17:32.213 --> 17:34.464
It's the 3rd round of the FA Cup.

17:34.466 --> 17:35.883
Here we go.

17:35.884 --> 17:39.011
It's Derby County against
Leeds United at the Baseball Ground.

17:39.012 --> 17:40.529
Come on, boys!

17:40.555 --> 17:42.819
Derby County in the white shirt...

17:42.849 --> 17:44.349
very much the underdogs...

17:44.351 --> 17:46.727
as they face
the First Division champions.

17:46.728 --> 17:52.244
Playing today in their away strip
of dark blue shirts and yellow shorts.

17:53.777 --> 17:55.792
Remember what I said.

17:55.904 --> 17:58.334
Giles dispossessed by Hector.

17:59.032 --> 18:01.199
Well, the atmosphere
is absolutely electric.

18:01.201 --> 18:02.911
But the pitch, as ever at Derby...

18:02.912 --> 18:05.888
in poor condition
and heavily sanded.

18:06.040 --> 18:08.875
Giles. Oh, that's a strong challenge
on McFarland.

18:08.877 --> 18:12.087
That was diabolical! Diabolical!

18:12.088 --> 18:15.215
There have been question marks
about some of Leeds players...

18:15.216 --> 18:17.895
intimidating referees.

18:21.264 --> 18:24.015
And it looks like McFarland
is out of the match.

18:24.017 --> 18:26.447
That don't look good.

18:27.938 --> 18:29.870
- You all right, Brian?
- Yeah.

18:32.150 --> 18:34.442
Leeds with the free kick.
Delivered deep.

18:34.444 --> 18:37.863
Oh, here's Clark e.
He's unmark ed at the back post.

18:37.864 --> 18:40.782
Leeds lead by one goal to nil!

18:40.784 --> 18:42.451
Well played, Billy.

18:42.452 --> 18:45.215
Giles with the corner.

18:46.081 --> 18:47.623
Bremner.

18:47.624 --> 18:49.425
Fucking close him down!

18:50.377 --> 18:51.919
Bremner's gone down!

18:51.920 --> 18:54.379
- What?
- There didn't appear to be any contact!

18:54.381 --> 18:58.258
- The referee has given a spot-kick.
- He never fucking touched him, ref!

18:58.260 --> 18:59.468
He dived!

18:59.470 --> 19:01.596
He fucking dived!

19:01.597 --> 19:03.529
Well played, Billy.

19:04.767 --> 19:06.225
And that penalty spot...

19:06.226 --> 19:10.365
is lost somewhere in the middle
of a desperate patch of mud.

19:11.315 --> 19:14.442
And it's 2-nil.
Leeds have won it now!

19:14.443 --> 19:17.528
Don Revie sending a clear message
to his rivals.

19:17.530 --> 19:20.907
Leeds is still
very much the team to beat.

19:20.908 --> 19:23.784
- Unlucky, unlucky.
- Derby totally outclassed.

19:23.786 --> 19:25.786
And for Brian Clough
and Peter Taylor...

19:25.788 --> 19:29.144
it's been a sobering afternoon.

19:33.087 --> 19:35.647
Didn't say goodbye.

19:36.257 --> 19:40.645
Or pay me the respect of staying
for a drink.

19:40.678 --> 19:42.970
Couldn't wait to get away.

19:42.972 --> 19:44.764
Well, he cheats and all.

19:44.766 --> 19:47.142
Neither of those goals
should've been allowed.

19:47.143 --> 19:50.535
We're just gonna have
to beat him, Pete.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.482
Beat him if it's the last thing I do.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.693
Thanks a lot, boss.

19:55.694 --> 19:59.999
- After you, Billy.
- Mr. Bremner, was that a dive?

20:01.200 --> 20:04.805
We need to get up
into the same division first.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.683
We need someone with a good head.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.250
- Experience.
- I know.

20:11.252 --> 20:13.252
Our lot were like headless chickens.

20:13.254 --> 20:14.879
First thing Monday morning...

20:14.880 --> 20:18.355
I want you to go and find me
that player, a wise head.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.218
- We haven't...
- No worry about money.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.943
That's my problem.
Just you go and find him.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.375
Well, Simon's eaten up
his mashed potato.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.946
Not now, love. Please.

20:39.948 --> 20:42.296
But it might be Pete.

20:43.201 --> 20:45.118
- Pete.
- Of course it's Pete.

20:45.119 --> 20:47.995
- Yeah, of course it's Pete.
- Don't be cheeky, Nigel.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.580
But it might be important.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.808
Come on, eat your carrot soup
for your mother.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.548
- Hello?
- You asked me to find a player...

20:57.549 --> 21:00.775
with a good head, experience.

21:01.011 --> 21:02.594
Well, I found one.

21:02.596 --> 21:04.096
He's perfect.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.305
Dave Mackay.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.433
Dave Mackay. He...

21:07.434 --> 21:10.144
- He's 150.
- I admit he's not young.

21:10.145 --> 21:12.646
Not young. He's old as bloody time.

21:12.647 --> 21:14.189
But, oh, he's clever, Brian.

21:14.191 --> 21:17.026
Keeps the ball well,
passes it better than anyone alive.

21:17.027 --> 21:18.485
Pete.

21:18.487 --> 21:21.843
That's enough. Come back.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.918
He's the one, Brian.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.367
Are you sure?

21:25.369 --> 21:28.013
Never been more sure
of anything in me life.

21:28.038 --> 21:30.330
All right.
I'll talk to Longson in the morning.

21:30.332 --> 21:31.707
Haven't got till morning.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.750
Hearts have already made him
an offer.

21:33.752 --> 21:35.169
Want him as their manager.

21:35.170 --> 21:37.684
Apparently,
the terms have been agreed.

21:37.798 --> 21:40.300
Well, what did you
bloody call me for then?

21:40.301 --> 21:43.344
Because when I asked Bill Nick
how done the deal was...

21:43.346 --> 21:45.242
he said 99%

21:47.017 --> 21:49.614
Meaning he hasn't signed.

21:49.811 --> 21:52.241
Exactly.

21:52.689 --> 21:56.127
Right, Brian, that's enough.
Come and sit down.

21:56.485 --> 21:59.045
Your dinner's getting cold.

22:04.785 --> 22:06.702
Brian?

22:06.703 --> 22:08.683
Love?

22:13.001 --> 22:15.168
Come on. Open.

22:15.170 --> 22:17.185
There you go.

22:18.340 --> 22:21.508
- Where will we play him, then?
- Somewhere he can see everything.

22:21.510 --> 22:23.552
Use his loaf, tell the kids what to do.

22:23.554 --> 22:25.054
- Play him at sweeper.
- Aye.

22:25.055 --> 22:27.473
He won't have to run about
so much now, will he?

22:27.474 --> 22:29.738
Fat bastard.

22:31.645 --> 22:33.729
What's all this I hear
about a tie shop?

22:33.731 --> 22:37.358
He got a tie shop, ain't he, in London,
which he spends 2 days a week at.

22:37.359 --> 22:39.401
Fucking tie shop?

22:39.403 --> 22:41.654
It's his little nest egg for the future.

22:41.655 --> 22:45.115
No one will be wearing fucking ties
in 20 years' time.

22:45.117 --> 22:48.452
I hope his footballing brain
is better than his business brain.

22:48.454 --> 22:51.680
Hey. Here, come on.
Get it down. Open.

23:01.551 --> 23:04.886
You know, it's illegal
to sign someone on the Sabbath.

23:04.887 --> 23:06.929
Is it?

23:06.931 --> 23:09.349
Well, perhaps
you should just shake on it today.

23:09.350 --> 23:10.683
And sign for it tomorrow.

23:10.685 --> 23:12.936
What? And let Hearts in
again in the morning?

23:12.937 --> 23:14.228
Fuck off.

23:14.230 --> 23:17.752
I'm not leaving here
without a signature.

23:17.942 --> 23:20.568
God, you'd bloody do that too
wouldn't you?

23:20.570 --> 23:23.822
Come all this way
just to shake hands.

23:23.823 --> 23:25.907
Dear, oh, dear.

23:25.909 --> 23:28.161
What would you do without me?

23:28.162 --> 23:31.304
Hey, you wouldn't have found him
if it weren't for me.

23:32.083 --> 23:34.893
Good job we're both wearing ties.

23:38.673 --> 23:43.144
Jehovah's Witness, Dave.
May the Lord be with you.

23:43.678 --> 23:46.388
- Who the bloody hell are you?
- My name's Brian Clough.

23:46.389 --> 23:49.099
I've the pleasure
of playing for England against you...

23:49.100 --> 23:51.495
in an under-23 match.

23:52.270 --> 23:55.033
I remember you now.

23:55.356 --> 23:58.816
You had a black eye.
A right bloody shiner.

23:58.818 --> 24:01.319
You never stopped fucking talking.

24:01.321 --> 24:02.779
What are you doing here?

24:02.780 --> 24:05.198
I've come to talk to you
about the promised land.

24:05.199 --> 24:07.074
A land of milk and honey.

24:07.076 --> 24:10.453
A little place up the M1
called Derby.

24:10.455 --> 24:12.767
May we come in?

24:13.666 --> 24:15.811
Aye.

24:18.546 --> 24:20.171
- Come on, lads!
- Knees up.

24:20.173 --> 24:21.882
That's it. That's it. Come on.

24:21.883 --> 24:23.508
It's supposed to hurt.

24:23.510 --> 24:27.696
- Faster. Come on.
- Come on, get those knees up.

24:28.098 --> 24:30.098
Dave Mackay.

24:30.100 --> 24:32.893
- You don't sound happy, Uncle Sam.
- I'm not.

24:32.894 --> 24:36.396
What were you thinking going
over my head? Why didn't you call?

24:36.398 --> 24:38.315
Because you'd have said no.

24:38.316 --> 24:40.150
Bloody right I'd have said no.

24:40.152 --> 24:41.485
The man's bloody crocked.

24:41.486 --> 24:43.653
Pete reckons he's good for
3 more years.

24:43.655 --> 24:45.030
Is he, fuck.

24:45.032 --> 24:48.325
He's broken
more bones than Eve the Knieve.

24:48.327 --> 24:50.369
Trust me, Mr. Chairman.

24:50.370 --> 24:52.662
It's money well spent.

24:52.664 --> 24:54.164
Who the fuck are they?

24:54.166 --> 24:57.501
That'll be Messrs. McGovern
and O'Hare.

24:57.503 --> 24:59.767
- Hello.
- Hello.

25:00.297 --> 25:01.839
Where did they come from?

25:01.840 --> 25:04.925
Me old stomping grounds,
Hartlepools and Sunderland.

25:04.927 --> 25:06.636
Very reasonable too.

25:06.637 --> 25:08.804
Just doing what's best for the club.

25:08.806 --> 25:11.236
That'll be my club, Brian. My club.

25:12.184 --> 25:13.767
5-a-sides.

25:13.769 --> 25:16.855
- Okay, lads.
- Come on, move! Move now!

25:16.857 --> 25:19.859
- Mr. Mackay, over here.
- Hey, you all right, fellas?

25:19.860 --> 25:21.527
Give them a smile.

25:21.528 --> 25:24.172
Pretend you're happy
to be here in Derby.

25:24.698 --> 25:29.003
If you lot don't perform for us,
I'll feed you to these guys, all right?

25:29.619 --> 25:32.495
- Who's got the prettiest face here?
- The one in the middle.

25:32.497 --> 25:35.874
- I think it's Dave Mackay, isn't it?
- I'm not answering that question.

25:35.876 --> 25:39.587
That's nice football, lads. Well done!

25:39.588 --> 25:41.687
Now you're thinking about it!

25:41.715 --> 25:46.051
Let's play some football!
Let's play some football!

25:46.053 --> 25:47.636
You're a genius, Pete.

25:47.638 --> 25:50.473
Bloody genius. How did you see it?

25:50.474 --> 25:52.224
Don't know. It's just obvious.

25:52.226 --> 25:55.645
McGovern in midfield.
Mackay at the back. O'Hare up front.

25:55.646 --> 25:58.439
It's the skewer, isn't it?
In the shish kebab.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.107
Beautiful.

26:00.109 --> 26:02.109
A thing of fucking beauty.

26:02.111 --> 26:04.708
- Hey, get off.
- Come on! That's the way!

26:07.700 --> 26:09.409
Dave Mackay.

26:09.410 --> 26:11.077
Out to McGovern.

26:11.078 --> 26:12.974
Oh, he hit it just right!

26:14.081 --> 26:15.998
O'Hare!

26:16.000 --> 26:17.667
And it's there!

26:17.668 --> 26:19.418
Yes! Come on!

26:19.420 --> 26:21.921
Durban back to McGovern.
McGovern with the shot.

26:21.923 --> 26:24.318
Durban. It's in!

26:26.469 --> 26:28.983
Oh, and a magnificent goal!

26:30.389 --> 26:32.223
And it's a goal!

26:32.225 --> 26:34.184
O'Hare and Hector
in the penalty area.

26:34.185 --> 26:36.603
O'Hare. Beautiful football!

26:36.604 --> 26:38.438
Yes! Come on!

26:38.439 --> 26:41.232
It was all so easy.

26:41.234 --> 26:43.026
- Yeah!
- That's it.

26:43.027 --> 26:44.923
Derby win the Second Division.

26:47.282 --> 26:50.757
It's a magnificent achievement
for Brian Clough's team.

26:50.910 --> 26:53.922
Go on, Brian. Fill it up. Fill it up.

27:29.576 --> 27:32.494
Shush, shush, look, look, look.

27:32.495 --> 27:34.475
Look.

27:38.334 --> 27:42.105
For Leeds
to win the First Division title...

27:42.464 --> 27:45.855
being named Manager of the Year
really is a dream come true.

27:46.885 --> 27:51.013
I've a lot of people to thank.
I've had a lot of support, all year.

27:51.014 --> 27:52.556
Yeah, you enjoy it, Don.

27:52.557 --> 27:56.309
Go home, put your feet up
and enjoy it. There's a good lad.

27:56.311 --> 27:59.146
Because we'll be in the First Division
next season.

27:59.147 --> 28:00.856
And we're gonna have you!

28:00.857 --> 28:04.829
- Yes! Yes!
- We're with you!

28:28.385 --> 28:31.470
Come on, boys. Let's go.

28:31.472 --> 28:33.238
That's it.

28:34.892 --> 28:37.037
Right.

28:37.686 --> 28:40.876
Better go and make myself known.

28:43.734 --> 28:45.609
Behave yourselves.

28:45.611 --> 28:47.194
Right.

28:47.196 --> 28:48.404
See you, lads.

28:48.406 --> 28:50.469
- See you.
- See you.

28:54.705 --> 28:58.974
All right, gentlemen,
gather around, please.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.847
Well, I might as well tell you now.

29:13.849 --> 29:16.976
You lot may all be internationals...

29:16.977 --> 29:19.979
and have won all the domestic
honours there are to win...

29:19.980 --> 29:22.231
under Don Revie.

29:22.233 --> 29:25.902
But as far as I'm concerned,
the first thing you can do for me...

29:25.903 --> 29:30.323
is to chuck all your medals and all
your caps and all your pots and pans...

29:30.324 --> 29:33.367
into the biggest fucking dustbin
you can find.

29:33.369 --> 29:36.579
Because you've never won
any of them fairly.

29:36.580 --> 29:40.102
You've done it all
by bloody cheating.

29:42.753 --> 29:46.297
Mr. William Bremner,
you're the captain and a good one.

29:46.299 --> 29:50.385
But you're no good to the team
and no good to me if you're suspended.

29:50.386 --> 29:53.221
I want you fit for every game.

29:53.222 --> 29:57.141
And I want good, clean,
attractive football from my captain...

29:57.143 --> 30:00.645
starting next week
at the Charity Shield.

30:00.647 --> 30:03.920
And you, Irishman.

30:04.317 --> 30:09.404
God gave you skill, intelligence and
the best passing ability in the game.

30:09.405 --> 30:11.739
What God did not give you
was 6 studs...

30:11.741 --> 30:14.468
to wrap around
another player's knee.

30:15.787 --> 30:19.831
Now, things are gonna be
a little different around here...

30:19.833 --> 30:21.875
without Don.

30:21.876 --> 30:23.585
Might feel strange at first.

30:23.586 --> 30:26.396
Might pinch a little
like a new pair of shoes.

30:26.756 --> 30:28.006
But...

30:28.008 --> 30:30.968
if you want your grandchildren
to remember you...

30:30.969 --> 30:34.262
as being something other than
the dirty buggers you once were...

30:34.264 --> 30:38.058
If you wanna be loved
as real champions...

30:38.059 --> 30:40.352
worthy champions...

30:40.354 --> 30:44.065
you're gonna have to work
and improve...

30:44.067 --> 30:46.860
and change.

30:46.861 --> 30:48.444
Now...

30:48.446 --> 30:52.336
let's start off
by playing some 7-a-sides.

30:53.409 --> 30:56.255
Mr. Revie never made us do that.

30:57.705 --> 31:00.456
Well, I'm not Mr. Revie.

31:00.458 --> 31:03.501
From now on, I don't wanna hear
that name again ever.

31:03.503 --> 31:07.130
Next player who mentions it or what
he did or didn't do in the old days...

31:07.132 --> 31:10.820
will spend a week
cleaning my boots.

31:12.095 --> 31:14.638
7-a-sides.
Keep it nice and clean. Hey.

31:14.639 --> 31:18.114
And sensible. No 50l50s.

31:18.518 --> 31:20.435
Right. I'll play meself.

31:20.437 --> 31:22.896
You might learn something,
Irishman.

31:22.898 --> 31:28.211
251 goals in 274 starts.

31:36.245 --> 31:39.580
I'd like to see Don-fucking-Revie
do that, eh?

31:39.581 --> 31:42.040
- First seven over here. Come on.
- There you go.

31:42.042 --> 31:44.168
- Hope he's ready.
- Come on, pal. Let's do it.

31:44.169 --> 31:46.295
Yes, Irishman, I'll have it here!

31:46.296 --> 31:48.255
I see nothing on, nothing on.

31:48.257 --> 31:50.466
Back to you, back to you!
Go, lad, come on!

31:50.467 --> 31:53.260
Billy will have it, Billy will have it!
Give it to Billy.

31:53.262 --> 31:55.805
- Yes, come on, Billy. I'm free!
- Here, come on!

31:55.806 --> 31:58.432
- Close him down, close him down!
- Come on.

31:58.434 --> 32:00.235
- Get that. Come on.
- Come on.

32:01.604 --> 32:04.105
Hey, 50l50, Norman.

32:04.106 --> 32:05.523
You deaf or what?

32:05.524 --> 32:06.941
- Jesus.
- Good tackle.

32:06.942 --> 32:10.235
What's the matter with you?
He said no 50l50s.

32:10.237 --> 32:13.489
- What are you gonna do? Book me?
- Yes, I will.

32:13.491 --> 32:15.533
You're a bunch of fucking bullies.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.701
It's a fair challenge, Norman.
Fair play.

32:17.703 --> 32:19.787
Up. Up.

32:19.789 --> 32:20.997
Easy, easy.

32:20.998 --> 32:22.873
Come on. 1, 2.
Pass and move.

32:22.875 --> 32:25.435
- Okay?
- Yeah.

32:29.424 --> 32:34.761
"251 goals in 274 starts."

32:34.763 --> 32:37.306
- "Goals."
- "Goals."

32:37.307 --> 32:39.683
He should've stayed
with Peter Taylor.

32:39.685 --> 32:43.409
I've heard he's the one
with all the talent anyway.

32:43.647 --> 32:47.335
Well, I'll tell you. He's no Don Revie.

33:03.209 --> 33:04.959
Best team in the country, Leeds.

33:04.961 --> 33:08.815
Best players. Best stadium.
Best backroom staff.

33:09.757 --> 33:12.436
Best everything, really.

33:13.886 --> 33:15.553
Right.

33:15.555 --> 33:19.266
Last time, there was a whole division
between you and Leeds.

33:19.267 --> 33:21.643
Not now. Not today.

33:21.644 --> 33:24.646
Today we're here
as Second Division champions.

33:24.647 --> 33:26.564
And equals with Leeds.

33:26.566 --> 33:30.193
John McGovern and Billy Bremner,
equals.

33:30.194 --> 33:33.321
- Kevin Hector and Johnny Giles.
- Equals.

33:33.323 --> 33:34.906
Good lad. Equals.

33:34.908 --> 33:37.284
Alan Hinton and Peter Lorimer...

33:37.285 --> 33:39.494
- equals
- Equals.

33:39.496 --> 33:41.538
John O'Hare and Paul Madeley.

33:41.539 --> 33:43.206
- Equals!
- Now, come on.

33:43.208 --> 33:45.083
Chins up, chests out.

33:45.085 --> 33:47.711
- We can take this lot. Come on!
- Come on!

33:47.712 --> 33:49.212
Equals, yeah!

33:49.214 --> 33:51.506
- Come on!
- Go! Get out there!

33:51.508 --> 33:53.592
- Come on. Get it, lad!
- Come on!

33:53.593 --> 33:56.320
- Come on, Leeds.
- Come on.

34:05.063 --> 34:09.440
Well, it's an achievement for Derby,
being promoted to the First Division.

34:09.443 --> 34:11.652
But the truth is...

34:11.652 --> 34:14.154
Leeds United have the habit
of reminding them...

34:14.156 --> 34:16.324
just how far they still have to go.

34:16.326 --> 34:19.328
They made us look like fools today.

34:19.329 --> 34:21.204
I mean, our boys...

34:21.206 --> 34:22.998
What was O'Hare doing?

34:22.998 --> 34:27.054
Letting Madeley bully him like that,
pushing him around.

34:27.754 --> 34:30.797
Madeley's half his bloody size.

34:30.799 --> 34:32.966
O'Hare needs to toughen up.

34:32.967 --> 34:35.592
He's from the Scottish dockyards,
isn't he?

34:35.594 --> 34:38.304
What about McGovern?
He was useless in the middle.

34:38.306 --> 34:40.181
Whose idea was that?

34:40.183 --> 34:42.163
Yours.

34:43.103 --> 34:45.228
Good lad.

34:45.230 --> 34:47.397
He was all over the place.

34:47.399 --> 34:49.108
Like the wandering Jew.

34:49.109 --> 34:53.152
Giving the ball to anyone but his own.
We need a ball player.

34:53.155 --> 34:54.612
A natural in midfield...

34:54.614 --> 34:58.052
who can hold on to it,
keep possession.

34:58.118 --> 35:01.426
Giving it away too easily.

35:01.955 --> 35:04.456
Someone like...

35:04.458 --> 35:06.058
Colin Todd.

35:06.293 --> 35:08.627
Oh, now you're talking.

35:08.629 --> 35:11.522
Lovely pair of feet.

35:12.091 --> 35:15.301
I've heard he wants out
of Sunderland too.

35:15.302 --> 35:18.693
They're all jumping ship up there.

35:19.014 --> 35:20.973
Go on, sign him then.

35:20.975 --> 35:22.600
What?

35:22.601 --> 35:24.143
We can't.

35:24.144 --> 35:25.978
Longson's already told us.

35:25.980 --> 35:28.410
"Club's in debt."

35:28.482 --> 35:31.650
Having said that, Derby had moments.
They played some football.

35:31.652 --> 35:35.571
They were brief moments perhaps, but
they did play some football at times.

35:35.573 --> 35:38.950
- But when you come up...
- Oh, bollocks to that!

35:38.951 --> 35:41.494
I didn't get us
all the way to the First Division...

35:41.495 --> 35:45.581
so we could sit there mid-table and
be cannon fodder for sides like Leeds.

35:45.583 --> 35:46.833
Sign the man.

35:46.834 --> 35:48.251
Hang on, hang on. Brian...

35:48.252 --> 35:52.171
I'll handle bloody Longson.

35:52.173 --> 35:55.675
Oh, you are a disgrace!

35:55.676 --> 36:00.012
For missing the target from there,
you want bloody shooting!

36:00.014 --> 36:01.639
Now, get in there!

36:01.641 --> 36:04.654
That's what I pay you for!

36:04.812 --> 36:07.522
170 grand for Colin-fucking-Todd?

36:07.523 --> 36:09.398
Correction,
"The Almighty" Colin Todd.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.526
Best technical footballer
in the country.

36:11.527 --> 36:14.862
And his salary's 300 quid a week?
We can't pay a footballer that.

36:14.864 --> 36:17.198
That's the way things are going,
Uncle Sam.

36:17.199 --> 36:19.199
Football's all about money now.

36:19.201 --> 36:21.493
I told you never to go
over my head again.

36:21.495 --> 36:23.746
I had no choice.
Windows opened up.

36:23.748 --> 36:26.374
You were in the bloody West Indies.

36:26.375 --> 36:27.750
Windows?

36:27.752 --> 36:31.796
- You mean, there are others?
- Messrs. Gemmill and Hennessey.

36:31.797 --> 36:33.380
Oh, for fuck's sake.

36:33.382 --> 36:35.216
Let me ask you a question,
Uncle Sam.

36:35.218 --> 36:37.010
What'd you come into football for?

36:37.011 --> 36:39.512
Support the football club
of my hometown.

36:39.514 --> 36:42.057
The club I've supported all my life.

36:42.058 --> 36:44.392
Well, I'm sure
we all admire your loyalty.

36:44.394 --> 36:48.563
I didn't come to be lectured by some
cocky little twat from the North East.

36:48.564 --> 36:51.274
The way I see it,
there's no point being in this game...

36:51.275 --> 36:53.150
unless you want to beat the best.

36:53.152 --> 36:54.402
And be the best.

36:54.404 --> 36:56.321
That's all the people of Derby want.

36:56.322 --> 36:58.573
If you really
have their interest at heart...

36:58.575 --> 37:01.243
Not just impressing your friends
in the director's box.

37:01.244 --> 37:04.412
- I suggest you keep your eyes
on your road haulage business.

37:04.414 --> 37:08.291
Keep your opinions to yourself and
start signing some fucking cheques.

37:08.293 --> 37:09.584
There's a good lad.

37:09.586 --> 37:12.754
Leave the running of this football club
to the professionals.

37:12.756 --> 37:15.674
Well, professionals
don't run the football club, Brian.

37:15.675 --> 37:17.509
The chairman does.

37:17.510 --> 37:20.929
If it's true football is all about money,
that's the way it's going...

37:20.931 --> 37:24.683
well, that suits us chairmen
just fucking fine.

37:24.684 --> 37:27.363
Because we're the ones
who've got it.

37:28.355 --> 37:30.647
- Come on, to feet!
- Okay, come on. Do it.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.775
That's it, lads!

37:32.776 --> 37:35.290
Frighten the shit out of them.

37:35.320 --> 37:38.280
Now, what was it last time?
5-nothing. Was it 5-nil?

37:38.282 --> 37:40.241
We'll hit double figures this time.

37:40.242 --> 37:44.286
- I'm taking the first penalty.
- It should be a smash-and-grab event.

37:44.288 --> 37:47.915
I see they've driven all the way
into the car park this time.

37:47.916 --> 37:50.809
Isn't a Cup game, is it?

37:51.253 --> 37:53.269
Tosser.

37:56.801 --> 37:59.677
Hey, shut up, shut up. Come on.

37:59.679 --> 38:01.638
All right. Right.

38:01.640 --> 38:03.682
He's coming.

38:03.683 --> 38:06.810
Come on, Derby!
Come on, Derby!

38:06.811 --> 38:08.561
Come on, Derby!

38:08.563 --> 38:11.773
Come on, Derby!
Come on, Derby!

38:11.775 --> 38:14.777
Come on, Derby!
Come on, Derby!

38:14.778 --> 38:18.134
Come on, Derby!
Come on, Derby!

38:41.430 --> 38:44.432
- You know what your job is today?
- Yes, boss.

38:44.433 --> 38:47.309
Stay in position. Keep the shape.

38:47.311 --> 38:48.936
Stop being the wandering Jew.

38:48.938 --> 38:50.396
Good lad.

38:50.397 --> 38:52.940
Enjoy it. You deserve to.

38:52.942 --> 38:56.084
You've worked hard. This week.

39:22.305 --> 39:25.056
Do you know
what you're doing today?

39:25.058 --> 39:27.058
Be big, be strong.

39:27.060 --> 39:28.602
Any chance I get...

39:28.603 --> 39:31.521
- flatten Paul-fucking-Madeley.
- Good lad.

39:31.522 --> 39:35.993
He bullies you, you bully him back.

39:38.655 --> 39:41.798
- Near post those corners we worked on.
- Yes, boss.

39:44.370 --> 39:46.469
Now...

39:51.085 --> 39:52.418
come on!

39:52.420 --> 39:54.139
Come on, Derby!

40:01.888 --> 40:04.236
Come on!

40:09.771 --> 40:12.481
Come on, Derby!
Come on, Derby!

40:12.482 --> 40:15.942
Come on, Derby!
Come on, Derby!

40:15.944 --> 40:18.654
Come on, Derby!
Come on, Derby!

40:18.655 --> 40:20.919
Come on, Derby!

42:08.600 --> 42:10.642
And?

42:10.644 --> 42:13.122
2-1.

42:14.815 --> 42:17.107
You clever, clever, clever bastard.

42:17.109 --> 42:18.984
You should've seen O'Hare's first.

42:18.986 --> 42:20.986
Turned Bremner inside out.
Beautiful.

42:20.988 --> 42:22.238
I tell you what, Brian.

42:22.239 --> 42:24.740
If we can beat this lot,
we could go all the way.

42:24.742 --> 42:27.718
Oh, yeah!

42:29.497 --> 42:32.081
And back again,
John Radford with him.

42:32.083 --> 42:34.395
O¡¦Hare!

42:34.418 --> 42:36.877
Ceaseless Derby pressure.

42:36.879 --> 42:39.393
McGovern! Oh, yes!

42:40.508 --> 42:42.884
How'd you define
your approach to management...

42:42.885 --> 42:45.731
apart from being brilliant?

42:46.597 --> 42:50.099
- Good lad.
- 2 in the middle. O¡¦Hare!

42:50.101 --> 42:53.436
How do you react when someone
says, "Boss, you're doing it wrong"?

42:53.438 --> 42:57.315
Well, I ask him how he thinks
it ought to be done.

42:57.317 --> 43:01.486
And then we get down to it
and we talk about it for 20 minutes.

43:01.487 --> 43:04.250
And then we decide that I was right.

43:05.575 --> 43:07.325
O¡¦Hare!

43:07.327 --> 43:10.912
And with that, Derby County
are the champions of England!

43:10.914 --> 43:14.104
It's an extraordinary story.

43:14.876 --> 43:18.629
I wouldn't say I was the best manager
in the country.

43:18.631 --> 43:20.397
But I'm in the top one.

43:25.429 --> 43:29.432
Some fella in London, England,
named... Some Brian...

43:29.434 --> 43:30.809
Brian Clough.

43:30.810 --> 43:33.895
I heard all the way in America
that this fella talks too much.

43:33.896 --> 43:37.148
They say he's another Muhammad Ali.
There's just one Muhammad Ali.

43:37.150 --> 43:39.317
Now, Clough, I've had enough.
Stop it.

43:39.319 --> 43:43.540
- Are you gonna stop it?
- No, I'm going to fight him.

44:01.466 --> 44:03.758
The twin towers
of Wembley Stadium.

44:03.760 --> 44:06.178
The cathedral of English football.

44:06.179 --> 44:09.139
Good afternoon, everyone.
It's the Charity Shield.

44:09.140 --> 44:12.225
The opening Saturday
of the 1974 season.

44:12.227 --> 44:14.519
And our first chance
to get a look at Leeds...

44:14.521 --> 44:17.356
under their new manager,
Brian Clough.

44:17.357 --> 44:20.609
- Will you be supporting Leeds today?
- You'll expect nothing less...

44:20.610 --> 44:22.610
having been the manager
for 13 years.

44:22.612 --> 44:24.654
Fact is, I'm here today
as England manager.

44:24.656 --> 44:28.325
Any words of advice for your
successor before his first game?

44:28.327 --> 44:29.618
Win.

44:29.620 --> 44:31.620
The people of Leeds
are used to winning.

44:31.622 --> 44:33.637
- Thanks, Dave.
- Thanks, Don.

44:39.213 --> 44:41.358
Right.

44:42.257 --> 44:46.361
Right, gentlemen, thank you!

44:47.262 --> 44:50.653
Team today is Harvey in goal.

44:51.725 --> 44:54.727
Reaney, Cherry, Bremner.

44:54.728 --> 44:56.478
My captain.

44:56.480 --> 44:59.732
McQueen, Hunter, Lorimer, Clarke.

44:59.733 --> 45:03.068
Jordan, Giles and Gray.

45:03.070 --> 45:09.215
Obviously, all eyes will be on us
to see how things have changed.

45:09.411 --> 45:11.640
Without Don.

45:11.913 --> 45:14.889
What might be different under me.

45:15.083 --> 45:18.937
Let's show them some of the things
we've been working on.

45:19.087 --> 45:22.181
Our changes in attitude...

45:22.674 --> 45:24.226
to a new outlook.

45:24.593 --> 45:26.573
New discipline.

45:27.429 --> 45:29.907
New approach.

45:30.975 --> 45:35.079
Let's see some of you playing
with a smile.

45:42.361 --> 45:46.072
There on his right, the man
who takes over from Don Revie...

45:46.073 --> 45:49.075
Brian Clough, who has one
championship to his credit...

45:49.076 --> 45:50.493
with Derby County.

45:50.494 --> 45:54.371
Brian Clough,
starting I suppose at the top.

45:54.373 --> 45:57.681
Not a bad way to open your account
with your new team at Wembley.

46:54.102 --> 46:56.186
Oh, beautifully played, Keegan.

46:56.187 --> 46:58.271
Got to hit it now.

46:58.272 --> 47:01.165
There's a chance on here
and it's block ed.

47:02.318 --> 47:05.045
Boersma's shot.

47:08.324 --> 47:12.785
And that look ed very much
like a right hook by Johnny Giles.

47:12.787 --> 47:14.037
That was shocking.

47:14.038 --> 47:17.081
Keegan has been poleaxed
and it was a right hook.

47:17.083 --> 47:19.209
That's a terrible foul.

47:19.210 --> 47:21.336
A minute afterwards,
watch as Bremner...

47:21.337 --> 47:23.379
appears to pat him
with his left hand.

47:23.381 --> 47:26.049
That right hand in the kidneys.

47:26.051 --> 47:29.636
And then down on the floor,
for no reason whatsoever.

47:29.638 --> 47:34.370
And Keegan's gonna get his little bit
of revenge there with a right cross.

47:34.726 --> 47:38.061
Surely, we've got to get away
from this.

47:38.063 --> 47:40.898
And Kevin Keegan,
having words with the referee.

47:40.899 --> 47:44.026
It rather looks as though the referee
has taken stronger action.

47:44.027 --> 47:47.715
Bremner is off,
and he's absolutely livid about it.

47:48.615 --> 47:50.073
For fuck's sake.

47:50.075 --> 47:52.326
They're both throwing
their shirts down.

47:52.327 --> 47:55.245
And really,
this is a side of English football...

47:55.247 --> 47:58.093
a face of English football
we do not want to see.

47:59.001 --> 48:02.378
To dismiss the referee's authority
in such a manner...

48:02.379 --> 48:05.058
cannot be good for the game.

48:06.425 --> 48:08.843
So the Cup winners...

48:08.844 --> 48:12.235
beat the League champions.

48:15.184 --> 48:16.903
William Bremner...

48:17.102 --> 48:21.438
your conduct in the Charity Shield
match was deplorable...

48:21.440 --> 48:24.286
and cannot be tolerated.

48:24.360 --> 48:27.528
We understand Leeds United
are taking disciplinary action...

48:27.530 --> 48:29.280
against you internally.

48:29.281 --> 48:34.285
However, the Football Association
has to be seen to make an example.

48:34.287 --> 48:38.290
We have therefore decided
to impose a fine of 500 pounds.

48:38.291 --> 48:39.708
Thank you.

48:39.709 --> 48:44.588
And a suspension
until September the 30th.

48:44.590 --> 48:46.938
What?

48:47.134 --> 48:49.301
September 30th?
That's over a month.

48:49.303 --> 48:51.137
That's 6 bloody weeks.

48:51.138 --> 48:54.364
I'll make it 7 if you carry on
with language like that.

48:55.059 --> 48:58.102
Come on. Double the fine.
Treble it. Anything.

48:58.103 --> 49:01.115
Just don't suspend him for that long.

49:01.357 --> 49:03.456
Gentlemen.

49:05.361 --> 49:07.445
He's my captain.

49:07.446 --> 49:10.802
Hey, he's the best player I've got.

49:26.507 --> 49:28.174
Hello?

49:28.176 --> 49:30.654
I suppose you've heard.

49:31.596 --> 49:35.984
Suspended for 11 bloody games.

49:36.434 --> 49:38.746
Well, you're buggered.

49:38.853 --> 49:41.771
Billy Bremner's the heart and soul
of that team.

49:41.773 --> 49:45.414
Plus, Mick Jones
and Eddie Gray are injured.

49:45.568 --> 49:49.279
Well, like I said, you're buggered.

49:49.280 --> 49:51.710
What do I do, Pete?

49:52.492 --> 49:55.219
I need new players.

49:56.287 --> 49:58.682
Tell me who to buy.

49:59.249 --> 50:01.249
No, Brian.

50:01.251 --> 50:05.686
No one scouts players like you, Pete.
You're the best.

50:05.714 --> 50:09.438
We can sort this place out together.

50:11.469 --> 50:14.029
You and me.

50:16.558 --> 50:18.703
Turn it around.

50:19.269 --> 50:22.032
It's too late, Brian.

50:22.314 --> 50:25.540
I'd have helped you once,
but not now.

50:25.692 --> 50:28.206
Not after what was said.

50:29.238 --> 50:32.084
We're on our own now, remember?

50:32.200 --> 50:34.844
Each man for himself?

50:36.913 --> 50:40.435
And I think it would be better
if you don't ring here again.

50:57.601 --> 51:00.519
These are heady days for
Brian Clough's Derby County...

51:00.520 --> 51:01.937
champions of England.

51:01.938 --> 51:05.690
They have the biggest night in
the club's history coming up in Turin...

51:05.692 --> 51:07.526
in only 4 days' time.

51:07.527 --> 51:11.321
The semi-final of the European Cup
against Juventus.

51:11.323 --> 51:14.241
But first today,
they've got quite a tricky challenge.

51:14.242 --> 51:16.660
They face Leeds United
whom they unseated...

51:16.662 --> 51:20.122
as the First Division champions
at the end of last season.

51:20.123 --> 51:24.013
Leeds, one would imagine,
will have revenge on their mind.

51:24.294 --> 51:26.962
Get me today's team sheet,
could you, Joe?

51:26.964 --> 51:30.174
There's always been a strong,
some might say unhealthy...

51:30.175 --> 51:32.718
rivalry between the 2 teams...

51:32.720 --> 51:34.470
and the managers in particular.

51:34.471 --> 51:38.140
It's well known there's no love lost
between Don Revie and Brian Clough...

51:38.142 --> 51:41.118
What's up, Uncle Sam?

51:41.645 --> 51:44.355
A bit below stairs
for you here, isn't it?

51:44.356 --> 51:46.953
Taken a wrong turn somewhere?

51:47.318 --> 51:48.568
Just seen the team sheet.

51:48.569 --> 51:51.320
Hinton, O'Hare, Todd, Mackay,
that's our strongest side.

51:51.322 --> 51:53.906
Of course it's our strongest side,
it's Leeds United.

51:53.908 --> 51:55.992
Would you prefer I send out
the apprentices?

51:55.993 --> 51:59.161
We're at Juventus midweek,
semi-final of the European Cup.

51:59.163 --> 52:02.804
Biggest night in the club's history.
Couldn't you field...?

52:03.501 --> 52:05.001
What?

52:05.002 --> 52:06.982
You know.

52:07.296 --> 52:10.059
A weaker side?

52:10.299 --> 52:13.509
Am I hearing right?
Is the chairman of this football club...

52:13.511 --> 52:16.554
seriously asking his manager
to lose?

52:16.556 --> 52:18.015
You know what I'm saying.

52:18.017 --> 52:21.185
Against their biggest rivals?

52:21.186 --> 52:23.604
The chairman of this football club...

52:23.606 --> 52:26.691
is asking his manager
to be pragmatic...

52:26.692 --> 52:28.526
and manage his resources.

52:28.527 --> 52:32.363
Prioritise. We've just embarked
on a huge programme of refurbishment.

52:32.364 --> 52:35.616
Improvement. New stand.
Better floodlights.

52:35.618 --> 52:38.345
We need a good run in Europe
to pay for it.

52:41.123 --> 52:46.021
I'm going to pretend
I didn't hear a word of this.

52:48.047 --> 52:50.089
You've still got an hour
before kick-off.

52:50.091 --> 52:53.718
I'd reconsider if I were you. I wouldn't
want my employer to be unhappy.

52:53.719 --> 52:55.864
My employer?

52:56.222 --> 53:00.693
Chairman of Derby County. Chairman
long before you ever showed up.

53:00.727 --> 53:02.561
Oh, that's right.

53:02.562 --> 53:06.856
You were chairman of Derby County
before I came here.

53:06.858 --> 53:08.066
I remember that.

53:08.067 --> 53:12.403
When Derby County were at the
fucking foot of the Second Division.

53:12.405 --> 53:14.781
When nobody had heard of them
for 20 years...

53:14.782 --> 53:18.242
and nobody had heard
of Sam-bloody-Longson ever.

53:18.244 --> 53:22.997
Full stop. And that's where you'd
still fucking be if it wasn't for me.

53:22.999 --> 53:25.166
At the foot
of the bloody Second Division...

53:25.168 --> 53:26.918
where nobody remembered you...

53:26.920 --> 53:28.587
and nobody had heard of you.

53:28.588 --> 53:31.398
There would be no Derby County
without me.

53:31.591 --> 53:33.133
No League title.

53:33.134 --> 53:34.759
No champions of England.

53:34.761 --> 53:38.532
Not without Brian Clough.

53:38.598 --> 53:42.142
I'm gonna give you some good advice,
Brian Clough.

53:42.144 --> 53:44.854
No matter how good you think you are
or how clever...

53:44.855 --> 53:47.523
how many fancy new friends
you make on the telly...

53:47.524 --> 53:51.109
the reality of footballing life is this:

53:51.111 --> 53:54.530
The chairman is the boss,
then comes the directors...

53:54.531 --> 53:58.033
then the secretary, then the fans,
then the players...

53:58.035 --> 54:00.286
and then finally, last of all...

54:00.287 --> 54:02.579
bottom of the heap,
the lowest of the low...

54:02.581 --> 54:05.667
comes the one, who in the end,
we can all do without...

54:05.668 --> 54:08.597
the fucking manager.

54:13.969 --> 54:16.613
What are you doing, Brian?

54:24.938 --> 54:27.689
You are a bloody disgrace!

54:27.691 --> 54:31.110
Hey, Bremner, you should be
in the bloody book for that!

54:31.111 --> 54:34.301
- Come on.
- Look at this!

54:46.001 --> 54:49.523
Fucking come on then, you bastard!

54:50.756 --> 54:52.882
You see what your lads are doing?

54:52.883 --> 54:55.977
They don't deserve to be
on the same pitch as my lads.

55:01.892 --> 55:04.156
Brian.

55:04.353 --> 55:06.452
Good luck in Europe.

55:06.981 --> 55:10.040
Peter, good luck in Europe.

55:11.235 --> 55:14.128
You fucking knobheads.

55:15.448 --> 55:18.590
Derby was unlucky, I can tell you.

55:31.130 --> 55:34.356
You bloody fool.

55:46.062 --> 55:49.105
- Are you disappointed, Mr. Clough?
- Disappointed, not a bit.

55:49.107 --> 55:51.455
My players
were heroic out there tonight.

55:52.360 --> 55:56.238
Effectively, we were playing the Italian
champions with a reserve team.

55:56.240 --> 56:00.034
Many of my first team are injured
thanks to the brutality of Leeds United.

56:00.035 --> 56:02.202
This happens
when you have a chairman...

56:02.204 --> 56:06.373
who authorises a multi-million-pound
refurbishment of the Directors' Box...

56:06.375 --> 56:10.086
and hospitality suites before
he pays for a proper squad.

56:10.087 --> 56:13.255
It depends on your priorities,
players or prawn sandwiches.

56:13.257 --> 56:14.757
I know which I'd prefer.

56:14.759 --> 56:20.405
I know which honest working-class
Derby supporters would prefer too.

56:23.267 --> 56:24.819
What I am say...

56:24.894 --> 56:29.413
We're taking you into hospital
now, love. Don't worry, okay?

56:31.109 --> 56:32.828
Heart attack, eh?

56:35.613 --> 56:39.669
Been having it for 3 weeks,
they reckon, one way or another.

56:41.286 --> 56:43.370
They ran all sorts of tests on me.

56:43.371 --> 56:45.663
I told them the only thing
they need to know...

56:45.665 --> 56:49.056
was that I share my professional
life with Brian Clough.

56:50.045 --> 56:52.974
That seemed to satisfy them.

56:55.926 --> 56:58.819
I'm only half joking, you know.

57:03.558 --> 57:07.033
- We still got jobs?
- We have.

57:07.062 --> 57:11.082
Longson has tried to put
a gagging order on me, of course.

57:11.233 --> 57:13.984
"Any further utterances in public...

57:13.986 --> 57:16.278
or media appearances
by Brian Clough...

57:16.280 --> 57:18.280
will be met with instant dismissal."

57:18.282 --> 57:20.032
Take notice and act accordingly.

57:20.033 --> 57:23.201
Would you like to hear
my contrite reply?

57:23.203 --> 57:25.954
- Go on, then.
- Written a letter to the board.

57:25.956 --> 57:29.583
You and I feel it is impossible
to continue our good work...

57:29.585 --> 57:30.793
with Derby County.

57:30.794 --> 57:36.107
We therefore wish to tender our
resignations with immediate effect.

57:36.967 --> 57:38.425
What?

57:38.427 --> 57:40.490
What do you think?

57:41.555 --> 57:43.265
I don't want to resign.

57:43.266 --> 57:46.601
Don't worry, they won't let us.
We just won them the Championship.

57:46.603 --> 57:50.480
But it'll strengthen our position
and force them to get rid of Longson.

57:50.482 --> 57:52.024
Oh, no.

57:52.025 --> 57:55.777
No, Brian, they'll never do that.
He's chairman...

57:55.779 --> 57:57.154
Look, I can't do it, Pete.

57:57.155 --> 57:59.614
I can't work with me hands tied.

57:59.616 --> 58:03.054
A chairman telling me
what I can and can't do?

58:03.370 --> 58:06.180
You're picking the wrong enemy,
Brian.

58:06.540 --> 58:08.999
The enemy's not Longson.

58:09.001 --> 58:10.751
It's Revie.

58:10.752 --> 58:12.794
And this obsession with Leeds.

58:12.796 --> 58:15.005
Don't be daft.

58:15.007 --> 58:16.257
We won the league, Pete.

58:16.258 --> 58:18.926
We're top dogs in Derby now,
Longson can't stand it.

58:18.927 --> 58:21.178
- That's the problem.
- No, it's not. It's you.

58:21.180 --> 58:24.140
This mad ambition.

58:24.141 --> 58:25.641
It comes and it goes.

58:25.643 --> 58:27.727
Sometimes it's good. Oh, yes.

58:27.728 --> 58:31.021
Like a fire that stirs everything up.

58:31.023 --> 58:34.316
Then there's this.
This thing that takes over.

58:34.318 --> 58:37.377
Destroys everything
that's good in your life.

58:42.702 --> 58:44.931
Please, Brian.

58:45.997 --> 58:49.207
Please tell me that this letter
is just a draught.

58:49.208 --> 58:51.472
You've not sent it.

58:51.961 --> 58:54.629
I'll be out in a couple of days.

58:54.630 --> 58:57.060
Let me talk to them.

59:01.012 --> 59:03.054
You'll all get the chance to say...

59:03.056 --> 59:06.266
...whatever it is you want to say
in due course...

59:06.267 --> 59:07.809
What are you doing?

59:07.810 --> 59:10.937
You weren't supposed to accept
our resignations.

59:10.939 --> 59:14.107
Shouldn't bloody well offer them,
then, should you?

59:14.108 --> 59:18.111
Look, you can't get rid of us.
It'd be a disaster for the club.

59:18.112 --> 59:19.904
For the whole of Derby.

59:19.906 --> 59:22.949
You can't keep shooting your mouth
off the way you have been...

59:22.951 --> 59:25.869
and issuing these ultimatums.

59:25.870 --> 59:27.829
With great reluctance...

59:27.831 --> 59:30.082
your resignations
have been accepted.

59:30.083 --> 59:33.226
Look, you can't do this.

59:33.254 --> 59:36.464
- It's madness.
- The decision stands.

59:36.465 --> 59:40.050
Car keys on the table and out.

59:40.052 --> 59:43.512
We're gonna create
a footballing dynasty here.

59:43.514 --> 59:45.973
Derby could be one of the greats.

59:45.975 --> 59:48.726
Alongside United, Liverpool, Leeds.

59:48.728 --> 59:50.708
Now!

59:51.230 --> 59:54.586
And don't dare
show your face here again.

01:00:11.126 --> 01:00:13.961
We've just heard that the controversial
former manager...

01:00:13.962 --> 01:00:16.713
of First Division Derby County,
Brian Clough...

01:00:16.715 --> 01:00:19.383
has been sack ed with his assistant,
Peter Taylor.

01:00:19.384 --> 01:00:22.511
The drama at Derby started
in the streets outside the ground...

01:00:22.512 --> 01:00:23.970
just before kick-off.

01:00:23.972 --> 01:00:26.402
3 quarters of an hour
before the match.

01:00:26.683 --> 01:00:29.601
And there
in the stand is Brian Clough.

01:00:29.603 --> 01:00:31.478
And listen to the crowd.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:34.398
We want Clough!
We want Clough!

01:00:34.399 --> 01:00:37.818
The chairman there answering
the catcalls of the Derby crowd.

01:00:37.819 --> 01:00:40.278
A big mouth,
but he's a good manager.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.531
We don't want to lose him
and we bloody lost.

01:00:42.532 --> 01:00:45.200
He might show off a bit sometimes,
but he's brilliant.

01:00:45.202 --> 01:00:47.995
- He brought this team up.
- Nobody on this world to touch him.

01:00:47.996 --> 01:00:49.871
- I think it's terrible.
- You think...?

01:00:49.873 --> 01:00:52.517
Yeah. The club will come to an end,
I think.

01:00:53.001 --> 01:00:56.878
Derby County players have officially
now joined the protest...

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:59.256
against the sacking
of manager Brian Clough.

01:00:59.258 --> 01:01:01.884
- Off to bed.
- The plotting's been done in black out...

01:01:01.885 --> 01:01:05.941
as the power cuts put in force by
Prime Minister Edward Heath continue.

01:01:05.973 --> 01:01:07.431
Quiet, quiet.

01:01:07.433 --> 01:01:11.370
"To the directors
of Derby County Football Club.

01:01:11.604 --> 01:01:14.647
We, the undersigned players,
are unanimous...

01:01:14.648 --> 01:01:17.921
in our support and respect
for Mr. Clough...

01:01:18.027 --> 01:01:19.611
and Mr. Taylor.

01:01:19.613 --> 01:01:21.822
And ask that they be reinstated...

01:01:21.823 --> 01:01:24.449
as manager and assistant manager
with the club."

01:01:24.451 --> 01:01:27.661
- Yeah.
- "Signed by... Signed by:

01:01:27.663 --> 01:01:33.584
John O' Hare, Roy McFarland,
Colin Todd, Kevin Hector.

01:01:33.585 --> 01:01:37.557
- Alan Hinton..."
- But not Dave Mackay.

01:01:40.968 --> 01:01:43.427
Who's just accepted the job.

01:01:43.429 --> 01:01:44.929
What?

01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:47.181
Dave Mackay?

01:01:47.182 --> 01:01:49.099
It's in the evening paper.

01:01:49.101 --> 01:01:52.019
I signed that fat fuck.

01:01:52.021 --> 01:01:55.606
Saved his professional life,
gave him 2 years as a player.

01:01:55.608 --> 01:01:59.249
Dave Mackay.
He wouldn't fucking dare.

01:02:05.034 --> 01:02:07.548
What have you done, Brian?

01:02:08.704 --> 01:02:11.099
I love this place.

01:02:11.374 --> 01:02:13.416
I'm happy here.

01:02:13.417 --> 01:02:15.397
So were you.

01:02:17.463 --> 01:02:19.130
It's not over yet, Pete.

01:02:19.131 --> 01:02:22.133
Lawyers are issuing a writ tomorrow
against Longson.

01:02:22.135 --> 01:02:25.679
The players have called a meeting.
There's talk they're going on strike.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.306
There's protest marches
arranged for this weekend.

01:02:28.307 --> 01:02:30.224
Why didn't you keep
your mouth shut?

01:02:30.226 --> 01:02:31.809
Hello, Derby-220.

01:02:31.811 --> 01:02:35.188
We're never gonna find
another place like this again.

01:02:35.189 --> 01:02:37.916
Brian, it's Mike Bamber
on the phone.

01:02:39.319 --> 01:02:42.487
- Who's Mike Bamber?
- I don't know.

01:02:42.489 --> 01:02:45.964
Chairman of Brighton
and Hove Albion.

01:02:58.797 --> 01:03:00.005
Good. This way.

01:03:00.006 --> 01:03:01.548
Big smiles, lads.

01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:03.676
The Johns are back in town, eh?

01:03:03.677 --> 01:03:06.220
I've known this one since he was 16.

01:03:06.221 --> 01:03:09.281
This one just plays like he's 16.

01:03:09.434 --> 01:03:12.310
- Are you gonna buy any more...?
- This one, Duncan McKenzie.

01:03:12.311 --> 01:03:14.395
Take your hands
out of your pockets, son.

01:03:14.397 --> 01:03:17.816
Remember that name,
28 goals last season.

01:03:17.817 --> 01:03:20.193
How many are you gonna get
this year?

01:03:20.194 --> 01:03:21.861
Just more than 28, really.

01:03:21.863 --> 01:03:24.072
Yeah. That's why I got you.

01:03:24.073 --> 01:03:27.116
Not for your quick wits,
for your quick boots.

01:03:27.118 --> 01:03:30.537
I think I scored 28 goals
in one game once.

01:03:30.538 --> 01:03:32.080
But they're gonna do the job.

01:03:32.081 --> 01:03:35.519
They'll be the saviours
of Leeds United, this lot.

01:03:40.674 --> 01:03:42.819
Lads.

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:45.552
What you buy them for?

01:03:45.553 --> 01:03:48.012
A little poof and a pair of reserves.

01:03:48.014 --> 01:03:49.973
Waste of bloody money.

01:03:49.975 --> 01:03:53.477
Duncan McKenzie scored 28 goals
last season.

01:03:53.478 --> 01:03:57.314
John O'Hare and John McGovern
are both internationals.

01:03:57.315 --> 01:04:00.233
We've got 2 strikers.
Allan Clarke and Mick Jones.

01:04:00.235 --> 01:04:01.652
They're internationals too.

01:04:01.653 --> 01:04:05.280
Yeah, one's injured
and the other suspended.

01:04:05.282 --> 01:04:07.950
If you spent a bit more time
on the training ground...

01:04:07.951 --> 01:04:10.619
you wouldn't have to waste money
buying Derby rejects.

01:04:10.621 --> 01:04:13.748
I mean, we have a game on Saturday,
against QPR.

01:04:13.749 --> 01:04:15.291
Or had you forgotten?

01:04:15.292 --> 01:04:16.959
No, I hadn't forgotten.

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:22.143
Well, you haven't told us a single
thing about how QPR are gonna play.

01:04:22.633 --> 01:04:25.593
Mr. Revie would've had files
and dossiers prepared.

01:04:25.594 --> 01:04:27.678
Had the reserves
playing the Rangers' way.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.347
The first team looking out
for this and that.

01:04:29.348 --> 01:04:32.704
Bollocks to Don Revie!

01:04:35.938 --> 01:04:38.606
You're professional footballers.

01:04:38.607 --> 01:04:40.316
Stop Stan Bowles.

01:04:40.317 --> 01:04:43.360
That's all you need to know
about QPR.

01:04:43.362 --> 01:04:46.489
And I don't have to justify myself
to you...

01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:49.783
...not how or when
I conduct training...

01:04:49.785 --> 01:04:53.621
not who I buy or pick to play.

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:55.458
No.

01:04:55.459 --> 01:04:57.807
No, not to us.

01:04:57.961 --> 01:05:02.547
But come Saturday afternoon,
there'll be 40,000 people out there...

01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:05.905
who you do have to
justify yourself to.

01:05:43.382 --> 01:05:47.259
- Hello?
- You must be loving this.

01:05:47.261 --> 01:05:49.595
Loving every minute.

01:05:49.597 --> 01:05:51.014
Who is this?

01:05:51.015 --> 01:05:53.933
Watching it all fall apart.
It's Brian Clough.

01:05:53.935 --> 01:05:55.602
What?

01:05:55.603 --> 01:05:58.438
They won't play for me.

01:05:58.439 --> 01:06:00.982
Your boys.

01:06:00.984 --> 01:06:04.043
Your bastard sons.

01:06:04.112 --> 01:06:05.987
And never will.

01:06:05.989 --> 01:06:08.365
What are you talking about?

01:06:08.366 --> 01:06:10.002
It's...

01:06:10.285 --> 01:06:12.828
It's 2:00 in the morning.

01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:14.579
Why are you ringing here?

01:06:14.581 --> 01:06:18.875
They're loyal to you.
Thought you might like to know that.

01:06:18.877 --> 01:06:21.795
Loyal to big daddy Don.

01:06:21.796 --> 01:06:24.839
For God's sake, go to sleep, man.

01:06:24.841 --> 01:06:27.259
Where's your dignity?

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:30.023
And don't ring here again.

01:07:33.954 --> 01:07:36.288
Look, the pub's just down there.
Not far to go.

01:07:36.290 --> 01:07:39.125
- No, no.
- Just down there.

01:07:39.126 --> 01:07:42.294
Oh, I don't like to be
Beside the seaside

01:07:42.296 --> 01:07:44.797
Hey, give it a chance.

01:07:44.798 --> 01:07:47.299
Brighton and Hove Albion?

01:07:47.301 --> 01:07:50.136
Have you seen where they are?
Bottom of the Third Division.

01:07:50.137 --> 01:07:52.179
We can get them
out of there like that.

01:07:52.181 --> 01:07:54.181
We did it with Hartlepools,
with Derby.

01:07:54.183 --> 01:07:58.019
We cared about Hartlepools
and Derby. We're from the North, Pete.

01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:00.771
What do we care about Brighton?

01:08:00.773 --> 01:08:02.482
Bloody Southerners.

01:08:02.483 --> 01:08:03.774
Look where we are.

01:08:03.776 --> 01:08:06.068
- We're almost in France.
- Hey.

01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:08.863
They've got money, this lot.
And ambition.

01:08:08.864 --> 01:08:11.991
Get a lungful of that air, eh?
Be good for me health.

01:08:11.993 --> 01:08:14.703
You can't manage a team
that's not your own people.

01:08:14.704 --> 01:08:16.578
Not what you know.

01:08:16.581 --> 01:08:19.541
Anyway, the protest movement
in Derby is still in full flow.

01:08:19.542 --> 01:08:23.598
- We can still get our jobs back.
- No, we won't.

01:08:23.796 --> 01:08:25.645
It's over, Brian.

01:08:26.256 --> 01:08:28.883
It's over, mate.
They're never gonna take us back.

01:08:28.885 --> 01:08:31.029
Not now.

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:35.777
Come on.

01:08:39.063 --> 01:08:44.067
Sign today,
and I'll give you a bonus of 7 grand.

01:08:44.068 --> 01:08:45.443
Each.

01:08:45.444 --> 01:08:47.694
7 grand?

01:08:47.696 --> 01:08:49.779
You hear that, Brian?

01:08:49.782 --> 01:08:53.090
Plus, a salary that exceeds by 20%

01:08:53.202 --> 01:08:55.368
what Derby were paying you.

01:08:55.371 --> 01:08:58.206
Very generous, Mike.

01:08:58.207 --> 01:08:59.415
Terrific.

01:08:59.417 --> 01:09:02.095
But those are First Division wages.

01:09:02.127 --> 01:09:05.046
First Division
is where I want this club to be.

01:09:05.046 --> 01:09:07.725
You sure you can afford it?

01:09:07.758 --> 01:09:10.318
You sure you're worth it?

01:09:11.511 --> 01:09:13.823
Cheeky sod.

01:09:16.559 --> 01:09:19.560
- We're gonna need a holiday first.
- Take as long as you like.

01:09:19.562 --> 01:09:22.479
2 weeks, somewhere hot, on you.

01:09:22.482 --> 01:09:25.707
I'll even throw in the bloody trunks.

01:09:34.868 --> 01:09:37.050
Right.

01:09:54.431 --> 01:09:56.576
Hey, come on. You get over there.

01:10:04.775 --> 01:10:07.621
Come on. Champions of the world.

01:10:08.946 --> 01:10:12.136
Peter. Hi.

01:10:17.412 --> 01:10:19.213
Brian!

01:10:20.792 --> 01:10:22.772
Come on.

01:11:07.172 --> 01:11:10.647
You're a hard man to find,
Mr. Clough.

01:11:11.719 --> 01:11:13.678
Who's looking?

01:11:13.679 --> 01:11:15.012
Keith Archer.

01:11:15.014 --> 01:11:19.153
I'm secretary
of Leeds United Football Club.

01:11:21.604 --> 01:11:23.771
- Nigel, come on.
- Let me have a go.

01:11:23.772 --> 01:11:26.482
I wanna have a go.

01:11:26.484 --> 01:11:30.487
I was sent by my chairman,
Mr. Cussins.

01:11:30.488 --> 01:11:34.508
He wants me to speak to you
face-to-face.

01:11:35.368 --> 01:11:37.632
Bloody hell.

01:11:38.079 --> 01:11:39.621
But we hate Leeds.

01:11:39.622 --> 01:11:42.290
It's the top flight, Pete.
It's the First Division.

01:11:42.291 --> 01:11:45.668
But we gave Brighton our word.
And they paid us the money.

01:11:45.670 --> 01:11:47.587
We can give back the money.

01:11:47.588 --> 01:11:49.839
Bollocks to bloody Brighton.

01:11:49.841 --> 01:11:52.676
I'd go mad.
We'd all go mad down there.

01:11:52.677 --> 01:11:56.012
- Mike Bamber's a good man.
- Oh, do me a favour.

01:11:56.013 --> 01:11:59.765
Look, he had faith in us. He offered
us a job when no one else would.

01:11:59.767 --> 01:12:03.728
He offered us a job. Now someone
else has offered us a better one.

01:12:03.730 --> 01:12:06.815
And not just anyone,
the best team in the country.

01:12:06.816 --> 01:12:08.567
Come on, Pete.

01:12:08.569 --> 01:12:11.445
That means it'd be
the Charity Shield at Wembley...

01:12:11.447 --> 01:12:12.947
...in a month's time.

01:12:12.948 --> 01:12:15.157
You know, European Cup after.

01:12:15.159 --> 01:12:18.035
But even if we won them,
they'd be Revie's achievements.

01:12:18.037 --> 01:12:20.218
His team.

01:12:21.248 --> 01:12:24.458
No, I gave Brighton my word, Brian.
I can't do it.

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:28.796
What? And you'd sooner fester down
there with all those bloody Tories...

01:12:28.798 --> 01:12:31.382
...in that blue-rinse
retirement home by the sea?

01:12:31.384 --> 01:12:33.551
Brighton's a small club,
I'll give you that.

01:12:33.553 --> 01:12:35.929
- Bloody midgets.
- But at least we'd be together.

01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:37.347
You and me, Brian.

01:12:37.348 --> 01:12:38.931
We can build them up.

01:12:38.933 --> 01:12:42.185
Make them our own.
Like we did with Hartlepools, Derby...

01:12:42.186 --> 01:12:44.770
Then? Bottle again soon
as it comes to the big time?

01:12:44.772 --> 01:12:47.148
That's always been the trouble
with you, Pete.

01:12:47.150 --> 01:12:48.750
No ambition.

01:12:49.569 --> 01:12:52.279
That's the trouble with you, Brian.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.072
Too much ambition.

01:12:54.073 --> 01:12:56.616
- Too much greed, everything.
- Yeah, you knock it.

01:12:56.618 --> 01:12:59.286
But it's done you proud
over the years, my ambition?

01:12:59.287 --> 01:13:01.955
Without me, you'd still be
in Burton-bloody-Albion.

01:13:01.956 --> 01:13:05.561
Yes, and without you,
I'd still have a job in Derby.

01:13:05.877 --> 01:13:08.962
A job and a home that I love.

01:13:08.964 --> 01:13:12.132
Oh, yes. You're the shop window.

01:13:12.133 --> 01:13:14.926
I grant you that.
The razzle and the bloody dazzle.

01:13:14.928 --> 01:13:16.777
But I'm the goods in the back!

01:13:17.305 --> 01:13:18.638
And without me...

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:22.267
...without somebody to save you
from yourself, Brian-fucking-Clough...

01:13:22.269 --> 01:13:23.852
...you're not just half!

01:13:23.854 --> 01:13:26.480
- You're nothing!
- I'm nothing?

01:13:26.481 --> 01:13:28.398
I'm nothing? Don't make me laugh.

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.193
What does that make you then,
Taylor? Something?

01:13:31.194 --> 01:13:33.069
You're half of nothing.

01:13:33.071 --> 01:13:34.696
Nothing's parasite.

01:13:34.698 --> 01:13:38.303
A big fat pilot fish
that feeds on nothing.

01:13:38.577 --> 01:13:40.828
A bloody nobody!

01:13:40.829 --> 01:13:42.955
The forgotten man!

01:13:42.956 --> 01:13:46.928
History's fucking afterthought!

01:14:00.851 --> 01:14:03.853
Boos here at Elland Road
for manager Brian Clough...

01:14:03.854 --> 01:14:05.646
which I'm sure won't worry him.

01:14:05.647 --> 01:14:09.288
Also boos for John McGovern.
Never nice to see a crowd get a player.

01:14:11.403 --> 01:14:14.822
That will worry Brian Clough.
It takes time to settle into a new club.

01:14:14.823 --> 01:14:18.795
It's not McGovern's fault
that Billy Bremner is missing.

01:14:28.462 --> 01:14:30.263
One Don Revie

01:14:30.589 --> 01:14:36.427
There's only one Don Revie
One Don Revie

01:14:36.428 --> 01:14:42.057
There's only one Don Revie
One Don Revie

01:14:42.059 --> 01:14:44.894
One Don Revie

01:14:44.895 --> 01:14:48.731
There's only one Don Revie

01:14:48.732 --> 01:14:50.732
One Don Revie

01:14:50.734 --> 01:14:53.413
There's only one...

01:15:02.163 --> 01:15:04.289
Fucking O'Hare.
You're fucking useless.

01:15:04.290 --> 01:15:07.728
Leeds doesn't want you.
Fuck off, Clough.

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:10.169
Fuck off, fuck off.

01:15:10.171 --> 01:15:13.147
We don't fucking want you here.
Fuck off!

01:15:21.641 --> 01:15:23.767
- Clough.
- Players' lounge, Brian.

01:15:23.768 --> 01:15:26.163
10 minutes.

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:50.558
Close the door.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.969
This is the worst start to a season
Leeds has had in 20 years.

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:01.568
4 points from 5 games.

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:04.538
Second from fucking bottom.

01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:11.037
What's going on?

01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:13.609
As far as I can see...

01:16:13.611 --> 01:16:15.945
there's no relationship,
no understanding...

01:16:15.947 --> 01:16:18.959
between players and management.

01:16:19.576 --> 01:16:21.757
Well, not a healthy one anyway.

01:16:24.789 --> 01:16:27.665
Perhaps if Mr. Clough
was to step outside...

01:16:27.667 --> 01:16:30.394
we might be able
to speak our minds.

01:16:35.342 --> 01:16:37.322
All right.

01:16:37.469 --> 01:16:39.983
If you wouldn't mind, Brian.

01:16:40.847 --> 01:16:43.444
Just for a few minutes.

01:16:45.894 --> 01:16:48.158
As you wish.

01:16:59.074 --> 01:17:02.785
Nobody likes him. The atmosphere
in the dressing room is non-existent.

01:17:02.786 --> 01:17:05.621
He's banned us from doing
all the things we used to do.

01:17:05.622 --> 01:17:08.206
Like playing bingo, carpet bowls.

01:17:08.208 --> 01:17:10.208
Tactically, he's never prepared.

01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:13.712
Right, he doesn't even tell us
how he wants us to play.

01:17:13.714 --> 01:17:17.651
We are not even allowed
to mention Mr. Revie's name.

01:17:18.093 --> 01:17:21.220
What me and the lads
are trying to say, Mr. Cussins, is...

01:17:21.221 --> 01:17:23.651
compared to Mr. Revie...

01:17:23.682 --> 01:17:26.445
he's just not good enough.

01:17:26.602 --> 01:17:29.032
What's going on, boss?

01:17:30.773 --> 01:17:35.672
The last 2 words of every story
ever written is what's going on.

01:17:36.697 --> 01:17:40.135
"The fucking end."

01:17:42.411 --> 01:17:43.963
Let's be honest, Brian.

01:17:44.746 --> 01:17:47.058
It's not working, is it?

01:17:47.249 --> 01:17:49.727
The players aren't happy.

01:17:49.835 --> 01:17:52.230
We're not happy.

01:17:52.254 --> 01:17:57.900
In truth, we should probably never
have hired you without Peter Taylor.

01:18:02.056 --> 01:18:03.988
So...

01:18:04.391 --> 01:18:07.533
- what do you want to do about it?
- It's not working.

01:18:09.772 --> 01:18:11.230
We have to part company.

01:18:11.232 --> 01:18:13.691
Fine, it will cost you 25 grand.

01:18:13.692 --> 01:18:15.359
What? For 6 weeks' work?

01:18:15.361 --> 01:18:17.403
Plus 3 and a half grand
for Jimmy Gordon.

01:18:17.404 --> 01:18:20.447
And an agreement that Leeds United
will pay both our taxes...

01:18:20.449 --> 01:18:23.492
- for the next 3 years.
- That is bloody criminal.

01:18:23.494 --> 01:18:25.203
- Throw in the Merc and all.
- What?

01:18:25.204 --> 01:18:28.664
Might be a bit flash for a man out
of a job, but I've grown to like it.

01:18:28.666 --> 01:18:31.180
Who do you bloody think you are?

01:18:32.086 --> 01:18:34.231
Brian Clough.

01:18:34.630 --> 01:18:37.440
Brian Howard Clough.

01:18:40.428 --> 01:18:44.069
Come on. There's something
we have to do on the way.

01:18:44.974 --> 01:18:47.155
Won't take long.

01:18:54.984 --> 01:18:56.901
Thanks for agreeing to this.

01:18:56.903 --> 01:18:58.320
No problem.

01:18:58.321 --> 01:19:01.415
Go easy on me though.
There's a good lad.

01:19:09.082 --> 01:19:10.832
How are you feeling, Mr. Clough?

01:19:10.834 --> 01:19:12.814
Not bad. Not bad.

01:19:12.836 --> 01:19:16.690
Onwards and upwards,
and all that type of thing.

01:19:17.799 --> 01:19:21.939
What's this?
We expecting guests?

01:19:30.355 --> 01:19:32.667
Take a seat there.

01:19:32.815 --> 01:19:35.293
You bastards.

01:19:40.073 --> 01:19:41.839
Stand by, studio.

01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:52.375
Title's out in 5, 4, 3...

01:19:52.377 --> 01:19:54.211
1.

01:19:54.212 --> 01:19:56.630
The football world was stunned
by the news...

01:19:56.631 --> 01:19:59.716
that Brian Clough has been sacked
as manager of Leeds United.

01:19:59.718 --> 01:20:03.387
We'll be talking not just to Brian,
but also to the man he replaced...

01:20:03.388 --> 01:20:06.317
whose success he couldn't emulate,
Don Revie.

01:20:06.766 --> 01:20:09.392
To Brian Clough, first of all.

01:20:09.394 --> 01:20:12.813
What's your reaction
to being sacked in this fashion?

01:20:12.814 --> 01:20:14.356
Well, obviously, Austin...

01:20:14.357 --> 01:20:19.339
me initial reaction is one of shock
at finding myself here with him.

01:20:20.072 --> 01:20:22.698
But in answer to your question...

01:20:22.699 --> 01:20:28.245
6 weeks is hardly a long time
to be given a chance in any job.

01:20:28.247 --> 01:20:33.376
I would hope that Revie
will get a lot longer time in his.

01:20:33.377 --> 01:20:36.212
Do you consider it was possible
to step into your shoes...

01:20:36.213 --> 01:20:38.255
Don Revie, to replace you?

01:20:38.257 --> 01:20:40.854
Well, being very, very honest...

01:20:41.302 --> 01:20:44.304
I think it was a very difficult job
for anyone to do.

01:20:44.305 --> 01:20:45.847
I do feel that Brian Clough...

01:20:45.848 --> 01:20:49.058
Now, I'll not call him Clough,
I'll not take him down like that.

01:20:49.059 --> 01:20:50.267
Thank you.

01:20:50.269 --> 01:20:54.241
I believe that he made it more difficult
on himself than he need have.

01:20:54.398 --> 01:20:56.440
And how did I do that, Don?

01:20:56.442 --> 01:21:00.111
All those accusations about
how dirty my players were, about...

01:21:00.112 --> 01:21:01.695
Well, they were dirty, Don.

01:21:01.697 --> 01:21:03.948
That's not true. Oh, no.

01:21:03.949 --> 01:21:05.240
Last 2 seasons...

01:21:05.242 --> 01:21:07.993
we were top of the charts
for entertaining football.

01:21:07.995 --> 01:21:10.872
Before that, you also topped
all the disciplinary charts.

01:21:10.874 --> 01:21:13.750
Should've been docked points,
sent down to Second Division.

01:21:13.752 --> 01:21:17.796
Listening to you, I'm struck this is not
just a business matter for you both.

01:21:17.798 --> 01:21:19.298
It's more than that.

01:21:19.299 --> 01:21:21.383
It's personal. Am I right?

01:21:21.385 --> 01:21:25.137
Well, we're very different people,
Don and I.

01:21:25.139 --> 01:21:28.808
We have different styles
in football and in life.

01:21:28.809 --> 01:21:31.352
I'm a warm man...

01:21:31.353 --> 01:21:32.853
an idealist.

01:21:32.855 --> 01:21:34.814
I do believe in fairies.

01:21:34.815 --> 01:21:38.651
And that's my outlook.
Don is slightly different.

01:21:38.652 --> 01:21:40.986
There's a hardness to him.

01:21:40.988 --> 01:21:42.988
- He's a cold person.
- You don't know me.

01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:45.241
That lack of warmth,
that coldness was there.

01:21:45.242 --> 01:21:48.327
- It permeated the club when I arrived.
- I totally refute that.

01:21:48.329 --> 01:21:51.331
You ask any of my players.
I was like a father to them.

01:21:51.332 --> 01:21:54.000
In that club every morning,
massaging those boys.

01:21:54.001 --> 01:21:56.836
- Did you do that for them?
- They would never have let me.

01:21:56.837 --> 01:21:58.128
Did you try?

01:21:58.130 --> 01:22:00.172
You didn't even try.

01:22:00.174 --> 01:22:02.967
I soaped those boys down
with me own hands.

01:22:02.969 --> 01:22:06.805
You just went to Leeds, no thought for
the club, no thought for the players.

01:22:06.806 --> 01:22:09.974
Just on some mad personal vendetta
against me.

01:22:09.976 --> 01:22:13.311
Are you surprised? What else was
I gonna do? After what you did.

01:22:13.313 --> 01:22:16.586
- What did I do?
- Come on, Don, you know exactly.

01:22:17.317 --> 01:22:22.001
January 27th, 1968.
See, I even remember the date.

01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:26.335
You came to Derby County,
3rd round of the FA Cup...

01:22:26.785 --> 01:22:29.495
and you refused
to shake my hand.

01:22:29.496 --> 01:22:33.248
Never. A matter of principle, I always
shake the other manager's hand.

01:22:33.249 --> 01:22:37.043
No, you shook Peter Taylor's hand
and me trainer, Jimmy Gordon's.

01:22:37.045 --> 01:22:39.171
- I probably didn't see you.
- You saw me.

01:22:39.172 --> 01:22:42.257
Considered me beneath you,
looked down on me, dismissed me...

01:22:42.259 --> 01:22:45.302
just like you did every other club
and every other manager.

01:22:45.303 --> 01:22:50.098
Never would I knowingly refuse
to shake a colleague's hand. No.

01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:54.369
But the truth is you were down
in the Second Division at the time.

01:22:54.396 --> 01:22:57.623
You know, I probably didn't know
who you were.

01:22:58.735 --> 01:23:01.403
Didn't know who I was?
Pull the other one.

01:23:01.404 --> 01:23:04.322
- That's the truth.
- Well, you certainly know now.

01:23:04.324 --> 01:23:06.825
Oh, we all know now.

01:23:06.826 --> 01:23:09.244
We know you as the man
whose constant outbursts...

01:23:09.245 --> 01:23:11.621
and defaming
of his fellow professionals...

01:23:11.623 --> 01:23:15.167
has brought this game,
this beautiful game, into disrepute.

01:23:15.168 --> 01:23:17.878
Who had a good job at Derby,
managed to get the sack.

01:23:17.879 --> 01:23:20.463
Who had the best partner
in Peter Taylor...

01:23:20.465 --> 01:23:22.257
and threw him away.

01:23:22.258 --> 01:23:25.760
Who was given one of the greatest
gifts in British football, Leeds...

01:23:25.762 --> 01:23:29.264
a club that in 10 years,
hadn't finished outside the top 4...

01:23:29.266 --> 01:23:32.601
and took them
to the bottom of the First Division.

01:23:32.602 --> 01:23:36.077
Oh, yes, it's fair to say
we all know who you are now.

01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:39.358
Okay, unfortunately,
we're gonna have to leave it there.

01:23:39.359 --> 01:23:41.443
Let's see where we are
in a year's time.

01:23:41.445 --> 01:23:44.947
- Oh, dear, oh, dear.
- Let's see where we both are in 5.

01:23:44.948 --> 01:23:47.658
That's it for tonight.
I'd like to thank my guests...

01:23:47.659 --> 01:23:50.285
Brian Clough and Don Revie,
the England manager.

01:23:50.287 --> 01:23:52.432
Thank you, Austin.

01:23:54.958 --> 01:23:56.458
And we're out.

01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:58.502
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

01:23:58.504 --> 01:24:00.982
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

01:24:53.018 --> 01:24:55.247
Boys?

01:24:55.354 --> 01:24:57.855
Do you think your old man is a fool?

01:24:57.856 --> 01:24:59.492
No.

01:24:59.525 --> 01:25:01.754
No.

01:25:01.861 --> 01:25:04.042
You're wrong.

01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:07.175
He bloody is.

01:25:08.617 --> 01:25:11.410
Who is the least mature person
in this car?

01:25:11.412 --> 01:25:14.258
Who most needs to bloody grow up?

01:25:18.127 --> 01:25:23.025
Who's been making a right arse
of himself in the past few months?

01:25:28.638 --> 01:25:31.765
Who fancies a trip to the seaside,
to see Uncle Pete?

01:25:31.766 --> 01:25:33.892
- Me.
- Me.

01:25:33.893 --> 01:25:36.241
Yeah, me too.

01:26:15.811 --> 01:26:18.395
Just wait in the car for a minute,
lads.

01:26:18.397 --> 01:26:21.491
I'm just gonna have a chat
with Uncle Pete.

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:42.150
So chucked you out already,
have they?

01:26:43.298 --> 01:26:45.361
They have.

01:26:46.843 --> 01:26:49.052
So how long was that?

01:26:49.054 --> 01:26:51.947
44 days.

01:26:54.476 --> 01:26:56.539
Impressive.

01:27:04.611 --> 01:27:06.923
So, what are you doing here?

01:27:09.658 --> 01:27:13.014
Don't make this difficult for me,
Pete.

01:27:14.204 --> 01:27:16.801
You know why I'm here.

01:27:21.086 --> 01:27:23.932
I won't bloody grovel.

01:27:24.631 --> 01:27:26.646
All right.

01:27:27.092 --> 01:27:30.530
Well, all right, I'm grovelling.

01:27:31.347 --> 01:27:33.742
I'm on me knees.

01:27:37.770 --> 01:27:40.146
"I apologise...

01:27:40.147 --> 01:27:41.981
unreservedly...

01:27:41.982 --> 01:27:44.496
for being a twat."

01:27:48.197 --> 01:27:52.003
- I apologise for being a twat...
- Unreservedly.

01:27:53.119 --> 01:27:54.671
Unreservedly.

01:27:54.787 --> 01:27:58.843
"Because I can't do it without you."

01:27:59.542 --> 01:28:01.376
Because I can't do it without you.

01:28:01.377 --> 01:28:04.650
"I'm nothing without you."

01:28:05.173 --> 01:28:08.102
I'm nothing without you.

01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:12.095
"Please...

01:28:12.096 --> 01:28:15.223
please, baby, take me back."

01:28:15.224 --> 01:28:17.287
- Fuck off.
- All right.

01:28:17.393 --> 01:28:18.726
Fine.

01:28:18.728 --> 01:28:21.040
Please. Please...

01:28:24.193 --> 01:28:26.374
baby...

01:28:27.363 --> 01:28:29.841
take me back.

01:28:45.756 --> 01:28:47.819
Come on.

01:29:05.526 --> 01:29:07.921
You're gonna fuck me up again,
aren't you?

01:29:08.363 --> 01:29:10.906
I love you, you know.

01:29:10.907 --> 01:29:12.970
I know.

01:29:13.493 --> 01:29:16.007
But it won't stop you.

01:29:17.539 --> 01:29:21.263
So would you sooner go through it all
without me?

01:29:26.631 --> 01:29:28.527
Never.

01:29:29.759 --> 01:29:35.806

01:29:48.862 --> 01:29:50.404
Hey.

01:29:50.405 --> 01:29:53.049
Come here, you two. Come here.

01:29:55.327 --> 01:29:57.472
Come here.

01:29:59.748 --> 01:30:02.308
Hey.

01:30:04.169 --> 01:30:05.919
- Wanna see your Auntie Lily?
- Yeah.

01:30:05.921 --> 01:30:07.901
Go on, then.

01:30:07.965 --> 01:30:10.563
Well, do you want a drink
while you're here?

01:30:11.011 --> 01:30:13.303
Well, I wouldn't say no.

01:30:13.305 --> 01:30:16.317
I got a drop of cooking sherry.

01:30:51.552 --> 01:30:53.511
We've got several things in common.

01:30:53.512 --> 01:30:57.348
But the main thing we've got in
common is we want the same things.

01:30:57.349 --> 01:31:01.310
You do let him speak from time
to time? I'll put a question to him.

01:31:01.312 --> 01:31:03.771
Do you find it difficult, Peter,
to get a word in?

01:31:03.772 --> 01:31:08.207
- He's quite a good talker, isn't he?
- Yeah. In public, yes, but...
