He's gonna be all right, then?

No. Batzarro means we can't save him.

Goodbye, Kal.

43:28.272 --> 43:29.478
Gonna miss you, pal.

Wish I could've learned more from you.

Stop with the opposite talk, man.

43:37.657 --> 43:41.366
No. Superman live.

43:47.917 --> 43:51.251
He's drawing the kryptonite radiation
from his body.

43:51.420 --> 43:53.912
And because he's Bizarre,
it doesn't affect him.

- Bad job.

that box of kryptonite anymore.
