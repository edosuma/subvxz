Ha!

00:32.554 --> 00:33.654
Cut!

00:34.189 --> 00:35.255
Yes.

00:38.828 --> 00:39.880
How was that?

00:41.530 --> 00:43.631
Cutting, turning around. Take 15.

00:43.665 --> 00:46.082
Harley, that was excellent.

00:46.544 --> 00:48.378
Okay, how's my accent?

00:49.608 --> 00:50.608
We'll get it.

00:50.706 --> 00:51.712
Kiki, a moment.

00:51.737 --> 00:54.275
Harley, This is hands down the
best thing you've ever done.

00:54.309 --> 00:56.043
- It is?
- They made you a costume,

00:56.389 --> 00:59.169
you are officially part of the
Kiki-Loki universe. You're canon!

00:59.639 --> 01:02.357
Dude, thank you so much for
letting me be here today.

01:02.405 --> 01:04.837
Are all the commercials for...

01:05.187 --> 01:06.554
- Do-shita-no.
- Do-shita-no or...

01:06.588 --> 01:08.022
Are they all like this?

01:08.056 --> 01:09.724
All the ones with Kiki-Loki, yeah.

01:09.758 --> 01:12.059
But in Japan Kiki-Loki's everywhere.

01:12.094 --> 01:14.430
Comic books, cartoons.

01:14.830 --> 01:17.031
I'm even wearing Kiki-Loki
underwear, check it out.

01:17.065 --> 01:19.879
Alright, I don't need to see
your big boy underpants.

01:20.535 --> 01:22.066
Since you seem to know...

01:22.812 --> 01:24.346
What is a Kiki-Loki?

01:24.671 --> 01:27.072
A half chicken, half elephant,

01:27.209 --> 01:29.646
half totally awesome
kirin-type creature.

01:29.704 --> 01:31.037
Why stop at three halves?

01:32.388 --> 01:34.886
Kiki-Loki spits in the
face of human arithmetic.

01:35.756 --> 01:37.890
My God, the assassins of thirst.

01:38.020 --> 01:40.154
You think I can just talk to them?

01:40.188 --> 01:42.657
Yeah, I'm sure they speak
"geeked out fan boy".

01:42.691 --> 01:44.692
- Go knock yourself out.
- No way.

01:45.794 --> 01:48.884
Hey superstar!

01:49.390 --> 01:51.586
Hey, this is my first job
as your primary agent.

01:51.800 --> 01:54.669
Vijay I wanna thank you so
much for this opportunity.

01:54.703 --> 01:56.986
I promise I will not let you down.

01:58.662 --> 02:01.271
You totally think I'm gonna let
you down. Come on, I'm a pro!

02:01.296 --> 02:02.992
Yeah, a pro who Hollywood
thinks is having

02:03.017 --> 02:05.009
- an extended nervous breakdown.
- Do you think that?

02:05.033 --> 02:08.068
No, no, of course not,
I just don't think that you are...

02:08.783 --> 02:11.285
- Committed to all of this.
- I am super committed.

02:11.319 --> 02:13.588
I swear on this stack of...

02:14.028 --> 02:15.471
- Do-shita-no.
- Do-shita-no,

02:15.496 --> 02:17.258
that I will not let you down.

02:17.548 --> 02:18.584
Mr. Carter?

02:19.127 --> 02:20.669
Ms. Hatanaka would like to see you.

02:20.786 --> 02:23.087
- Who is that?
- The actress you're starring with.

02:23.231 --> 02:25.266
Yes, Kiki-Loki.

02:25.300 --> 02:26.592
Let's go.

02:33.308 --> 02:35.376
So what do you think so far?

02:35.410 --> 02:37.144
Not really thinking,

02:37.179 --> 02:40.081
just taking in the
amazingness of it all.

02:40.115 --> 02:41.882
Thank you so much for helping us.

02:41.917 --> 02:45.303
Everyone loves your
character Charlie Carter.

02:45.411 --> 02:47.913
Not as much as they love Kiki-Loki.

02:48.090 --> 02:50.099
Well, Kiki-Loki stands for everything

02:50.124 --> 02:51.492
that is good in the world.

02:51.526 --> 02:53.135
People do love that.

02:53.358 --> 02:55.626
People also love Jin.

02:56.576 --> 03:00.330
In over 60 years Jin is only the
third person to wear the costume.

03:00.869 --> 03:05.439
Before her, only her father and her
grandfather had been Kiki-Loki.

03:05.474 --> 03:08.576
It is my family's business.
I had no choice.

03:08.610 --> 03:12.615
Sorry, but can't anybody
just wear the costume?

03:14.883 --> 03:18.217
Couldn't anyone just be Charlie Carter?

03:18.820 --> 03:21.357
Yeah, you're right,
it would not be the same.

03:21.523 --> 03:24.616
Anyway, thank you,
it's an honour to help you sell your...

03:24.893 --> 03:28.329
Dai... sha... to...

03:28.363 --> 03:30.030
- Da-shita-no.
- Do-shta-no.

03:30.065 --> 03:31.098
Doshtanno.

03:31.133 --> 03:34.589
Speed right past the "t" as
if it is not even there.

03:34.980 --> 03:36.057
Do-shta-no.

03:36.628 --> 03:39.262
Do-shta-no!

03:39.708 --> 03:40.739
You'll get it.

03:41.246 --> 03:42.660
We should get back.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.439
Got a kick.

03:44.579 --> 03:45.629
See you on set.

03:50.652 --> 03:51.919
Mr. Carter.

03:52.554 --> 03:54.522
I know you find this all pretty strange.

03:54.556 --> 03:55.809
Well, we don't really have a ton

03:55.833 --> 03:58.301
of magical chicken-elephants
here in Bishop.

03:58.326 --> 04:00.751
No, but you do have similar things.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.892
Do you know how Santa
Claus became popular?

04:03.074 --> 04:04.556
By giving away presents?

04:04.933 --> 04:07.519
A soft drink company took
a character many people

04:07.544 --> 04:09.834
had never heard of and
created a mythology.

04:10.238 --> 04:14.472
But really Santa Claus is just
a hermit who enslaves elves.

04:14.774 --> 04:16.176
Forces them to make toys,

04:16.214 --> 04:19.176
then in the middle of the
night breaks into your house.

04:19.915 --> 04:22.257
To preserve this story,
parents lie to their children.

04:22.847 --> 04:24.757
I find that terrifying.

04:25.253 --> 04:26.745
Well yeah, but presents.

04:27.269 --> 04:28.403
Made by slaves.

04:28.523 --> 04:29.713
Elves.

04:30.458 --> 04:32.924
Who don't get paid, so slaves.

04:33.093 --> 04:35.049
Well yeah, but it makes people happy.

04:35.263 --> 04:36.612
As does Kiki-Loki.

04:39.686 --> 04:42.402
Alright, this time you will
drink the Do-shita-no.

04:42.604 --> 04:44.995
This will give you and
Kiki-Loki the power

04:45.020 --> 04:48.068
to defeat the assassins and
bring happiness to the world.

04:48.310 --> 04:50.744
Drinking from a can laid
by a mythological creature

04:50.779 --> 04:53.026
is a small price to pay
for world happiness.

04:53.638 --> 04:54.905
Okay back to ones everyone!

04:55.050 --> 04:56.714
- Places!
- Places!

04:56.985 --> 04:58.752
Vijay, man thanks for
making this happen.

04:58.787 --> 05:00.493
Hey, any friend of Harley's.

05:01.195 --> 05:02.493
You guys know Harley Carter?

05:02.991 --> 05:04.594
Kinda best friends so...

05:05.183 --> 05:07.284
Wait, do you guys know Kiki-Loki?

05:07.429 --> 05:08.896
We know Jin, yeah.

05:08.930 --> 05:10.865
I'm Harley's agent Vijay Gill.

05:10.899 --> 05:12.519
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:13.666 --> 05:15.233
Your boy is killing it out there.

05:15.512 --> 05:16.946
He tends to bring it.

05:17.148 --> 05:18.482
Okay guys, we're good to go!

05:18.673 --> 05:20.608
- Quiet on set!
- Roll sound!

05:20.642 --> 05:22.409
And...

05:22.789 --> 05:24.879
- Action!
- Ha!

05:27.015 --> 05:28.382
Jin!

05:31.686 --> 05:32.753
Jin!

05:44.350 --> 05:45.379
Is she okay?

05:46.739 --> 05:47.906
I think she's dead.

05:50.167 --> 05:51.191
Get the medic!

06:20.691 --> 06:22.236
There's a noticeable flush in the face,

06:22.260 --> 06:23.852
but she's wearing a 50-pound suit.

06:24.019 --> 06:25.887
So you're thinking, what, heart attack?

06:25.921 --> 06:27.622
Could be, or a stroke.

06:27.665 --> 06:30.219
Rare in somebody so young,
but not totally unheard of.

06:30.768 --> 06:33.125
I'll be able to tell you more
when I get a closer look.

06:38.609 --> 06:40.140
- Is she okay?
- Let me check.

06:40.778 --> 06:42.616
Hey, what's up?

06:43.205 --> 06:45.279
It's just so tragic.

06:45.616 --> 06:48.381
Kiki-Loki was such an
inspiration to so many people.

06:48.997 --> 06:50.731
It's just hard to believe she's dead.

06:51.170 --> 06:52.898
Hey Sam, were you a fan too?

06:52.923 --> 06:54.981
Because I had no idea
this was such a big deal.

06:55.006 --> 06:57.779
No, and that is why we have
to take a good long look

06:57.829 --> 07:00.149
at what happened, because a lot
of people gonna wanna know.

07:00.237 --> 07:01.704
So, do you wanna go get changed?

07:01.881 --> 07:03.048
Yeah.

07:07.472 --> 07:08.805
What happened?

07:08.840 --> 07:10.407
It's okay Dot, I'm fine.

07:10.441 --> 07:12.203
What happened to Kiki-Loki?

07:12.276 --> 07:13.944
It happened less than an hour ago,

07:13.969 --> 07:15.209
how did you find out so quick?

07:15.471 --> 07:16.538
Google Alert.

07:16.563 --> 07:18.686
Hey man, why didn't you tell
me Dot was also a Kik?

07:18.791 --> 07:19.829
What?

07:19.854 --> 07:22.054
Kik, Geek, fans of Kiki-Loki.

07:22.419 --> 07:23.794
How am I supposed to know that?

07:23.867 --> 07:26.177
There are three Kiki-Loki in my room.

07:26.271 --> 07:27.714
Dot, I've been in your
room exactly once,

07:27.738 --> 07:29.175
and you told me if it
ever happened again

07:29.199 --> 07:30.635
I could go live in the bushes.

07:30.667 --> 07:33.203
Are you making jokes at this moment?

07:33.228 --> 07:34.766
- No, no.
- Too soon.

07:34.791 --> 07:38.319
No, I'm sorry, I realize that
Kiki-Loki represents everything

07:38.344 --> 07:39.748
that's good in the world.

07:40.189 --> 07:41.322
I want to help.

07:41.439 --> 07:42.906
There's nothing to help with, okay?

07:42.940 --> 07:44.832
We're just getting into it,
I'll let you guys know

07:44.856 --> 07:46.143
if we find anything out.

07:47.598 --> 07:49.222
We must do something.

07:49.662 --> 07:52.432
I feel your pain, man... you... Dot...

07:54.251 --> 07:55.318
Sorry.

07:56.420 --> 07:59.556
So isn't that standard
procedure on a job like this?

07:59.590 --> 08:00.944
Usually as the on-set medic,

08:00.969 --> 08:02.568
you barely know who the actors are.

08:02.829 --> 08:04.828
You're just there in case
someone has a reaction

08:04.862 --> 08:06.312
to the shrimp on the craft table.

08:06.630 --> 08:09.015
But in this case, for Jin,
the company made sure they shared

08:09.040 --> 08:10.507
all her medical records with me.

08:10.532 --> 08:11.532
So she was sick.

08:12.079 --> 08:13.406
No, but a couple of months ago

08:13.431 --> 08:15.031
she had some pretty significant surgery.

08:15.273 --> 08:17.174
A huge artery in her chest was repaired.

08:17.415 --> 08:19.498
But she was cleared for work.

08:19.877 --> 08:22.045
She was still taking some post-op meds.

08:22.079 --> 08:25.243
Mostly blood pressure pills,
but other than that she was healthy.

08:25.556 --> 08:27.759
Amazingly so, considering
what she'd just been through.

08:28.516 --> 08:30.220
Which, sadly doesn't mean anything.

08:30.588 --> 08:31.610
No.

08:31.656 --> 08:34.058
When it's your time,
there's nothing you can do.

08:34.292 --> 08:35.565
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

08:37.427 --> 08:40.249
Hey, Harley, do you think the police
will have to interrogate you?

08:40.336 --> 08:42.975
Well yeah, but because
I am the police sort of,

08:43.030 --> 08:44.308
I'll make sure to go easy on me.

08:44.332 --> 08:45.979
I just don't want it
to make you look bad.

08:48.159 --> 08:49.570
Vijay, I didn't kill her.

08:49.595 --> 08:51.289
Okay, hey I don't need to
know what happened,

08:51.313 --> 08:54.015
- I just have to manage the damage.
- There's no damage to manage.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.726
Okay, say no more, I'm on it.

08:57.247 --> 08:58.281
What is he on?

08:58.736 --> 09:00.203
No way this was an accident.

09:00.390 --> 09:02.518
Okay a little bit of crazy
in your eyes right now.

09:02.553 --> 09:05.021
Okay, so when you say
there was an accident

09:05.055 --> 09:07.401
we're supposed to just buy it,
but when I say it I'm crazy.

09:07.676 --> 09:09.143
Okay, what do you think happened?

09:09.389 --> 09:11.474
I think one of the assassins
of thirst killed her.

09:12.159 --> 09:14.319
You think she was killed
by a fictional character?

09:14.490 --> 09:18.393
One of the assassins,
one of the actors was watching her.

09:18.497 --> 09:20.692
Watching... watching, between shots.

09:20.955 --> 09:23.816
Not sure I can sell watching
equals murder to Sam,

09:23.841 --> 09:25.143
especially since we don't even know

09:25.167 --> 09:26.634
if this was a suspicious death.

09:26.659 --> 09:27.986
You know what? We're on it.

09:28.393 --> 09:30.027
Let the professionals handle it.

09:33.198 --> 09:35.772
Dai, we're so sorry for
what happened today,

09:35.797 --> 09:37.430
but we need to ask you a few questions.

09:37.734 --> 09:38.883
Whatever you need.

09:39.423 --> 09:41.094
How well did you know Jin?

09:41.592 --> 09:44.520
We had made several
Kiki-Loki commercials

09:44.545 --> 09:45.958
over the past few years.

09:46.697 --> 09:48.809
She was the one who originally hired me.

09:49.367 --> 09:52.296
We worked extremely well together.

09:52.937 --> 09:54.200
Jin hired you?

09:54.225 --> 09:55.717
She had a say in things like that?

09:56.540 --> 09:57.832
Nobody's told you?

09:58.738 --> 10:02.229
Jin isn't... wasn't just Kiki-Loki,

10:02.254 --> 10:04.068
she was the head of the company.

10:04.849 --> 10:06.294
Ever since her father died.

10:07.685 --> 10:09.591
We were gonna go back to the beginning,

10:10.357 --> 10:14.104
recreate some of the very
first Kiki-Loki commercials.

10:15.059 --> 10:17.761
Introduce Kiki-Loki to
a whole new generation.

10:18.462 --> 10:20.730
This was supposed to be
the start of something.

10:21.299 --> 10:23.178
- Not the end.
- Are you the police?

10:23.668 --> 10:24.951
Good. Inside.

10:27.104 --> 10:28.338
Jin's stepmother.

10:28.549 --> 10:31.595
I find if you just agree
with everything she says

10:31.620 --> 10:34.344
the conversation goes more smoothly.

10:44.462 --> 10:45.812
Do you know why this commercial

10:45.837 --> 10:47.540
is shooting in Bishop, Mr. Carter?

10:48.139 --> 10:49.640
Because it was the most reasonable

10:49.665 --> 10:51.437
of all my unreasonable demands?

10:51.554 --> 10:52.718
Because of me.

10:52.851 --> 10:55.342
Because I thought having you in the
commercial would help the company.

10:55.366 --> 10:57.801
And you're the one who makes
those sorts of decisions?

10:57.835 --> 11:00.136
I'm the one who makes all
the important decisions.

11:05.876 --> 11:08.297
My apologies for being so clumsy.

11:10.012 --> 11:12.528
My apologies for being so rude.

11:14.051 --> 11:17.888
Earlier this year I lost my husband,

11:18.599 --> 11:20.957
and now my stepdaughter is dead.

11:22.870 --> 11:24.322
I'm halfway around the
world from my home

11:24.346 --> 11:26.146
and I'm the one who has
to deal with all this.

11:27.031 --> 11:29.578
We understand Jin was
recovering from surgery?

11:30.156 --> 11:31.501
An aortic aneurysm.

11:32.328 --> 11:33.771
Six months ago she woke up

11:33.796 --> 11:36.081
in the hospital barely able to move.

11:36.573 --> 11:38.206
But she recovered quickly.

11:38.574 --> 11:42.540
Many experts told me that she was...

11:43.821 --> 11:45.368
Fine to do this commercial.

11:46.584 --> 11:48.057
Obviously they were wrong.

11:48.986 --> 11:50.533
Someone has to pay for this.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.149
Well, you may be looking
at a malpractice suit,

11:53.174 --> 11:55.762
but in the meantime we will
find out whatever we can.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.606
Whatever I can do, please let me know.

12:02.566 --> 12:04.670
Yeah, the sooner the case is solved,

12:04.695 --> 12:06.635
the sooner people stop
putting "Harley Carter"

12:06.660 --> 12:08.488
and "dead actress" in the same sentence.

12:09.073 --> 12:11.514
Yeah, whatever I can do, I will.

12:12.021 --> 12:13.303
Mhm, okay.

12:14.858 --> 12:18.504
Hey Dot, I just wanted to say
thank you for letting me crash here.

12:18.613 --> 12:22.986
Sure, and I'm sorry I called
you a yappy little dog.

12:23.277 --> 12:25.155
I don't remember that.

12:25.189 --> 12:26.967
You weren't here when I said it.

12:27.499 --> 12:29.772
But I think you're looking
out for Harley now.

12:29.952 --> 12:32.495
Before I thought you
were feeding his crazy.

12:32.530 --> 12:34.444
My mistake.

12:35.499 --> 12:37.033
You going somewhere?

12:37.214 --> 12:38.481
Hey Dot, you ready?

12:38.506 --> 12:39.856
Hi.

12:41.394 --> 12:44.129
Wait, you're gonna try and
find out how Kiki-Loki died?

12:44.187 --> 12:45.942
- No we're not.
- Hell yeah we are.

12:45.976 --> 12:48.311
But Harley said that there
was nothing suspicious yet.

12:48.345 --> 12:50.914
Harley also called Kiki-Loki a
"chicka-phant."

12:51.085 --> 12:52.624
He's not invested in this.

12:53.350 --> 12:55.781
I am paid to be invested on his behalf.

12:56.821 --> 12:57.851
Let me come.

12:58.489 --> 13:01.925
We might need someone with
a suit who looks good.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.967
You look like a garbage
man and no one likes me.

13:07.865 --> 13:10.467
Okay, fine, let's roll.

13:18.963 --> 13:20.063
Cyanide?

13:21.191 --> 13:22.696
I'm as surprised as you are.

13:22.930 --> 13:24.697
She didn't die from her surgery?

13:24.888 --> 13:26.155
No, she was poisoned.

13:26.394 --> 13:27.897
It can present like a heart attack,

13:28.149 --> 13:29.426
but I wanted to make sure.

13:29.933 --> 13:32.400
Doesn't it usually take weeks
to get a report like this?

13:33.128 --> 13:34.971
I may have called in some favours.

13:35.656 --> 13:36.969
Because you were suspicious?

13:37.101 --> 13:38.211
Not exactly.

13:41.144 --> 13:42.745
Because it was Kiki-Loki.

13:48.819 --> 13:50.119
So...

13:50.354 --> 13:52.171
Do you tweet?

13:54.725 --> 13:55.736
Thank God.

13:55.783 --> 13:59.062
So, the manager,
now that I slipped this friend

13:59.087 --> 14:01.565
of mine 20 bucks, is
gonna send someone over

14:01.590 --> 14:02.965
who saw Jin before she died.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.666
For sure Jin was here?

14:04.691 --> 14:06.002
She was staying at this hotel.

14:06.036 --> 14:08.385
Apparently she met people down here.

14:08.900 --> 14:10.518
Okay, so what does that even prove?

14:10.741 --> 14:13.774
One clue at a time there Watson,

14:13.799 --> 14:15.659
you can't find a single breadcrumb

14:15.684 --> 14:16.951
and immediately know...

14:17.487 --> 14:19.750
What kinda bread you're eating.

14:20.292 --> 14:22.010
Yeah, close enough.

14:26.356 --> 14:28.958
So Dot, I have to admit,

14:28.992 --> 14:31.127
I didn't peg you as a Kiki-Loki fan.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.134
Okay, good talk.

14:39.069 --> 14:42.038
Like many Japanese men after the war,

14:42.072 --> 14:44.507
my father worked hard.

14:44.555 --> 14:47.658
It was his job to put food on the table.

14:48.557 --> 14:50.946
- He wasn't cuddly was he?
- Not cuddly.

14:51.221 --> 14:53.716
There was one thing we disagreed about.

14:54.918 --> 14:57.376
- Kiki-Loki.
- He told me it was silly.

14:58.493 --> 15:00.521
But I couldn't help myself,

15:01.358 --> 15:05.914
and then I started finding
Kiki-Loki toys in my backpack.

15:06.860 --> 15:08.546
I thought it was my mother.

15:09.566 --> 15:15.071
Then one day I saw him
leaving it on my shoe.

15:17.140 --> 15:19.742
Kiki-Loki reminds you
of him, doesn't it?

15:22.479 --> 15:24.714
If you tell Harley this story...

15:25.816 --> 15:29.118
Your coffee truck will
become a smoking ruin

15:29.361 --> 15:32.088
no one will know how it happened.

15:32.756 --> 15:34.256
Secret's safe with me Dot.

15:37.294 --> 15:38.516
What about you, Dave?

15:39.262 --> 15:42.523
Saturday morning cartoons.

15:42.672 --> 15:44.427
I used to get up at
the ass crack of dawn

15:44.452 --> 15:47.837
and I'd watch all the regular stuff,
but Kiki-Loki...

15:48.652 --> 15:51.013
Man Kiki-Loki blew my mind.

15:51.388 --> 15:52.692
It was like it was speaking a language

15:52.716 --> 15:53.950
that only I could understand.

15:54.474 --> 15:55.507
Japanese?

15:55.579 --> 15:58.081
Sekai Ni mis'terareta toki Ni.

15:58.915 --> 16:00.382
When the world's against you.

16:00.484 --> 16:01.491
Yeah.

16:01.852 --> 16:03.999
Felt like I was part
of something special.

16:06.656 --> 16:08.624
You guys asking about
the dead Japanese chick?

16:08.665 --> 16:10.630
Yeah, I doubt we phrased it that way.

16:10.655 --> 16:12.318
- Yes.
- What do you wanna know?

16:12.826 --> 16:13.826
Who was she here with?

16:14.331 --> 16:16.535
A couple of white guys,
another Asian dude.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.067
Anyone you knew?

16:18.332 --> 16:19.902
No, all out-of-towners.

16:19.936 --> 16:21.937
Tucked into a table in the corner.

16:26.009 --> 16:27.977
Yeah I don't have anymore questions.

16:28.011 --> 16:29.912
Harley always has questions.

16:31.007 --> 16:32.335
Do you have any photos?

16:32.953 --> 16:36.020
No, but do you wanna know about the guy

16:36.045 --> 16:37.472
who tried to get close to them?

16:37.964 --> 16:40.089
The guy who we had to
throw out of the bar

16:40.123 --> 16:42.128
because he kept saying how
much he loved Kiki-Loki?

16:42.793 --> 16:44.560
I bet I know who that is.

16:46.730 --> 16:49.298
- Am I right?
- Yep, that's him.

16:49.566 --> 16:51.497
The assassin of thirst guy.

16:56.751 --> 16:58.376
Somebody killed her?

16:58.675 --> 17:01.099
That is what we are investigating, yes.

17:01.513 --> 17:03.445
But we do not think it was accidental.

17:03.621 --> 17:05.255
- What now?
- Well now we dig in.

17:05.823 --> 17:08.117
We take a look at who
may have wanted her dead,

17:08.722 --> 17:11.741
who loved her, who hated her,
who could get close to her.

17:12.088 --> 17:13.827
This is horrible.

17:14.089 --> 17:16.406
We'll need a list of all
of the names of anyone

17:16.432 --> 17:19.023
who had access to her room,
a complete crew list.

17:19.415 --> 17:21.108
Will you be bringing in experts?

17:21.412 --> 17:22.608
Federal investigators?

17:23.019 --> 17:24.054
What do you mean?

17:24.434 --> 17:27.869
A complex case involving an
internationally known celebrity.

17:27.904 --> 17:29.872
I need to know the most
experienced detectives

17:29.906 --> 17:31.249
are looking into it.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.360
Well, I appreciate your concern,
but we're on it.

17:45.726 --> 17:47.774
- So what now?
- So like you said, we dig in.

17:49.813 --> 17:50.893
What's up guys?

17:50.927 --> 17:53.529
Well, you know,
I don't wanna say I told you so,

17:53.563 --> 17:56.135
and I don't wanna seem like
I'm being crazy again, but...

17:56.160 --> 17:59.477
One of the tight-fitting
onesie boys was following Jin.

17:59.954 --> 18:01.989
You should arrest him for killing her.

18:06.543 --> 18:07.610
You're welcome.

18:08.845 --> 18:11.147
Kinda stole my thunder there, Dot.

18:13.850 --> 18:15.151
They're just trying to help.

18:15.185 --> 18:17.419
'Cause we're all
detectives now, I get it.

18:18.054 --> 18:20.732
Eli Truscott, do you remember
him from the commercial?

18:20.757 --> 18:21.794
Assassin number three?

18:21.819 --> 18:23.351
Honestly it was like Mardi Gras on acid.

18:23.375 --> 18:25.795
Unless he wasn't dressed up,
I would not remember him.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.005
Eli Truscott?

18:31.434 --> 18:32.857
- Yeah.
- Detective Shaw

18:32.882 --> 18:34.263
from the Bishop police department.

18:35.226 --> 18:36.460
You're here about Jin's death.

18:36.485 --> 18:38.751
Yeah, is it okay if we
ask you a few questions?

18:39.676 --> 18:40.725
Go ahead.

18:41.144 --> 18:43.272
Did you know Jin Hatanaka?

18:44.223 --> 18:46.048
Of course I knew her, I worked with her.

18:46.082 --> 18:47.669
Did you ever see her outside of work?

18:47.934 --> 18:49.518
No. Is that it?

18:49.543 --> 18:50.653
I've gotta get back inside.

18:50.687 --> 18:51.832
What about your smoke?

18:52.122 --> 18:53.656
Eli, who's there?

18:53.690 --> 18:54.719
No one Mom!

18:54.744 --> 18:57.226
- Well, it sounds like Harley Carter!
- It's not Mom.

18:57.251 --> 18:59.477
Invite him in,
I have a bone to pick with him.

18:59.502 --> 19:00.557
Alright, Mom!

19:05.477 --> 19:06.724
Hello Mom.

19:07.311 --> 19:10.672
Well, I just wanna know why
you haven't kissed her yet?

19:11.433 --> 19:13.181
Sadly I don't have much say

19:13.206 --> 19:15.206
in the storylines of Call Carter, sorry.

19:15.315 --> 19:18.335
Every week, I tune in
to see if you will.

19:18.476 --> 19:20.265
Well, it's our diabolical plan.

19:20.517 --> 19:23.234
Well, what we're really here
to talk about is Eli.

19:23.562 --> 19:25.920
Eli, we have an eyewitness
that says you got awfully close

19:25.945 --> 19:27.224
to Jin during the commercial.

19:27.390 --> 19:29.286
I just go where the AD tells me.

19:29.793 --> 19:31.994
Alright, well what about these?

19:32.028 --> 19:36.045
We got half a dozen emails
from you to Ms. Hatanaka.

19:36.070 --> 19:37.333
"From your biggest fan."

19:37.367 --> 19:39.101
Assassin number three, you wanna explain

19:39.135 --> 19:42.506
why you were sending emails to
a star you say you did not know?

19:43.006 --> 19:45.436
Yeah, I was just hoping
to butter her up,

19:45.461 --> 19:47.430
to get a bigger role, maybe a line.

19:48.071 --> 19:49.577
Something to stand out.

19:49.612 --> 19:51.203
You were in a onesie and a Kabuki mask,

19:51.228 --> 19:52.346
I don't think you needed a line.

19:52.370 --> 19:55.205
And then there's the fact that you
were stalking her at her hotel bar.

19:59.164 --> 20:00.222
Excuse me.

20:03.607 --> 20:04.607
Hey Chief, what's up?

20:04.719 --> 20:08.393
Shaw, do you know a
Princess Mako of Akishino?

20:08.876 --> 20:10.626
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

20:10.737 --> 20:12.238
Well, she knows who you are.

20:12.264 --> 20:14.493
She's part of the Japanese royal family.

20:14.518 --> 20:17.809
Who's just called me asking how
this investigation is going.

20:18.270 --> 20:19.301
What?

20:19.326 --> 20:21.771
Yeah, and solving this crime was
a pretty big deal to her.

20:22.111 --> 20:24.001
Wow, umm, okay.

20:24.779 --> 20:26.009
I'd love you to wrap this up.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.228
Copy that.

20:54.760 --> 20:56.627
Of course I wouldn't hurt Jin.

20:57.250 --> 20:59.272
I loved her, she loved me too.

21:00.219 --> 21:01.474
She loved you?

21:02.150 --> 21:04.365
Well, she never said it,
but she didn't have to.

21:04.835 --> 21:06.904
Did you ever actually talk to her?

21:07.616 --> 21:09.271
Yeah of course, at the commercial.

21:10.850 --> 21:14.111
She didn't know I was there,
she clearly wanted to be alone,

21:14.136 --> 21:18.121
but when I introduced
myself she was so nice.

21:19.364 --> 21:20.519
Do you mind?

21:20.779 --> 21:21.917
Can I have a puff?

21:22.205 --> 21:25.391
I'm not supposed to,
but it smells so good.

21:27.071 --> 21:29.962
I guess our shared secret
brought us closer together.

21:30.713 --> 21:34.281
When I got this role,
I suspected it was destiny,

21:34.343 --> 21:39.260
but when I spoke to her, I knew it was.

21:44.753 --> 21:46.705
I knew that there were people
like this in the world,

21:46.729 --> 21:48.706
but to meet one is terrifying.

21:49.232 --> 21:52.153
I came home to my place, one night in LA

21:52.178 --> 21:53.623
and there was this woman in my kitchen.

21:53.647 --> 21:55.923
I had no idea who she
was or how she got there,

21:55.948 --> 21:57.916
but she was really happy to see me.

21:57.941 --> 21:58.975
What did she want?

21:59.809 --> 22:01.577
She was dressed up as Lazy Jane.

22:01.603 --> 22:04.071
It's a character from my
show who hunted my character

22:04.113 --> 22:05.199
for a few seasons.

22:05.340 --> 22:07.675
This lady wanted me to
kill her as Lazy Jane,

22:07.700 --> 22:09.926
so that my character would
be free of Lazy Jane.

22:09.951 --> 22:12.053
That's crazy, what did you do?

22:12.255 --> 22:14.614
I sat her down, we had a few drinks,

22:14.639 --> 22:16.139
and eventually we had sex.

22:16.832 --> 22:17.842
I'm kidding.

22:17.867 --> 22:19.747
I called her an Uber,
then I got a restraining order,

22:19.771 --> 22:21.738
and then I got her the proper
medical attention.

22:22.165 --> 22:23.935
I think we should tear
this guys house apart,

22:23.960 --> 22:25.778
see if we can find traces of cyanide.

22:25.810 --> 22:27.589
Shaw, TV-guy.

22:27.981 --> 22:30.072
I just got my ass handed
to me by some woman

22:30.106 --> 22:31.786
who says she's involved
in this commercial.

22:31.832 --> 22:32.874
That would be Michelle.

22:32.909 --> 22:35.077
Right, well someone's
broken into her hotel room.

22:35.111 --> 22:38.113
She wants to make sure
Bishop's finest investigators

22:38.138 --> 22:39.325
are sent to figure out who did it.

22:39.349 --> 22:41.583
Chief, we've got a good
suspect in this murder...

22:41.618 --> 22:43.712
Yeah, who will still be here
when you get back.

22:44.063 --> 22:47.589
And to me, this company's
weird mascot dies,

22:47.636 --> 22:49.978
one of their hotel rooms gets
cleaned out, it feels like...

22:50.003 --> 22:51.291
- it feels...
- Hinky?

22:51.432 --> 22:52.454
No.

22:52.479 --> 22:55.740
Off, suspect, funny,
peculiar, not funny, ha, ha?

22:55.765 --> 22:57.065
Just... would you just go?

22:57.100 --> 22:58.958
Not right? Fishy?

22:58.983 --> 23:00.089
'Cause I can smell fish.

23:00.114 --> 23:01.924
Chief, did you have fish for lunch?

23:11.193 --> 23:12.395
Here we go. Here we go.

23:12.420 --> 23:13.521
Harley Carter.

23:14.454 --> 23:16.134
- Eddie Hughes.
- I'm Alex.

23:16.159 --> 23:18.304
We're just in the middle of something,
you want a selfie?

23:18.328 --> 23:20.580
Yeah, we don't wanna interrupt
or you know invade your space,

23:20.604 --> 23:22.149
but we would love to talk.

23:22.174 --> 23:23.860
Yeah, you guys were
at the commercial.

23:23.885 --> 23:24.969
That's right, yeah.

23:25.022 --> 23:26.367
Brutal thing that happened there.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.922
Right. Are you with Do-shita-no?

23:29.026 --> 23:31.842
No-no-no not yet, but between us,

23:31.982 --> 23:33.089
we got our eye on them.

23:33.210 --> 23:35.445
We've seen their financials,
they are a great target.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.714
We're a private equity play.

23:36.739 --> 23:39.374
We buy companies and sell off
the most profitable parts,

23:39.426 --> 23:41.703
or identify what they're
doing wrong and then fix it.

23:41.952 --> 23:43.186
And then you sell them.

23:43.220 --> 23:44.235
Yep.

23:44.563 --> 23:47.129
We think you could really help
boost value at Do-shita-no.

23:47.784 --> 23:49.839
Isn't that what the
commercial was all about?

23:50.361 --> 23:52.820
No, no, we're thinking way beyond that.

23:53.129 --> 23:54.555
We thought you looked incredible on set,

23:54.579 --> 23:56.279
and your character Carter has got legs.

23:56.304 --> 23:57.952
We think it can work
with either this company

23:57.976 --> 23:59.421
or other companies that
we got our eye on.

23:59.445 --> 24:00.685
All right, well come on Harley.

24:00.997 --> 24:02.731
You think about what we just said.

24:03.034 --> 24:04.034
Right.

24:04.059 --> 24:07.328
Making money by tearing down
other people's life work,

24:07.647 --> 24:08.762
how could I forget that?

24:09.480 --> 24:11.047
Yeah, he'll come around.

24:11.949 --> 24:17.447
Jewelry, cash, computers,
they even broke into my safe.

24:17.538 --> 24:20.298
- When did it happen?
- I don't know. Earlier today.

24:20.323 --> 24:21.355
I went out for a couple of hours.

24:21.379 --> 24:22.799
When I got back it was like this.

24:22.824 --> 24:23.869
We're so sorry.

24:23.894 --> 24:25.978
Detectives, my
step-daughter was murdered

24:26.003 --> 24:27.698
and now someone is trying to target me.

24:27.723 --> 24:30.071
We will do everything that we
can to find out who broke in.

24:30.096 --> 24:31.923
I need answers.

24:35.612 --> 24:37.751
I hate to say it,
but I think I agree with the chief,

24:37.848 --> 24:39.816
which makes me feel a
little hollow inside.

24:39.997 --> 24:41.996
Yeah it does feel coincidental.

24:42.144 --> 24:44.488
The break-in, Jin's poisoning.

24:44.780 --> 24:47.130
It does seem like somebody's
trying to target this company.

24:56.636 --> 24:58.470
So high fives all around.

24:58.690 --> 25:01.340
The bottle you found contained
several pills laced with cyanide.

25:01.565 --> 25:03.677
Almost certainly the stuff
that killed Ms. Hatanaka.

25:03.769 --> 25:05.737
How does somebody even get cyanide?

25:05.936 --> 25:07.097
You can buy it online.

25:07.155 --> 25:08.692
But whoever did that put it in pills

25:08.717 --> 25:10.784
that look suspiciously
like blood pressure meds.

25:11.326 --> 25:13.258
Like the pills I found in Jin's trailer.

25:13.895 --> 25:16.054
So maybe Michelle put
some of those pills

25:16.079 --> 25:17.648
in Jin's bottle and waits?

25:17.906 --> 25:19.749
Hey, did you lift any
prints off that bottle?

25:19.783 --> 25:21.799
Nothing, Wes says it's
clean as a whistle.

25:22.771 --> 25:25.639
So she carefully wipes the
prints from the bottle,

25:25.713 --> 25:27.914
but then carelessly leaves her safe open

25:27.962 --> 25:29.351
and invites the police over?

25:29.526 --> 25:30.828
You thinking it was planted?

25:30.853 --> 25:32.887
No, we don't know what
we're thinking yet.

25:33.130 --> 25:34.537
- Thanks Nic.
- Yep.

25:36.915 --> 25:38.382
So they've found the murder weapon.

25:38.502 --> 25:39.999
The killer can't be far behind.

25:40.408 --> 25:41.703
Thanks for letting us down here.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.206
I know you must be breaking some rules.

25:44.299 --> 25:46.214
The Kiki-Club has to stick together.

25:47.749 --> 25:48.761
Now scram.

25:48.824 --> 25:50.026
Okay.

25:50.274 --> 25:51.374
Bye.

25:53.116 --> 25:55.551
Do you think there's such
thing as a consulting detective

25:55.586 --> 25:56.986
to a consulting detective?

25:57.020 --> 25:58.254
Like a detective once removed?

25:58.288 --> 26:00.382
- But we didn't really do anything.
- Not yet.

26:00.407 --> 26:02.525
What do you mean?
They found the murder weapon,

26:02.559 --> 26:05.356
so likely the person whose room
they found it in is the killer.

26:05.381 --> 26:07.323
What hotel we talking about?

26:07.358 --> 26:09.224
The same one we were
at earlier in the bar.

26:09.408 --> 26:11.498
- Do you have a move in mind?
- Same move as you.

26:11.638 --> 26:13.248
- We find the killer.
- How?

26:14.491 --> 26:15.619
I know a guy.

26:17.398 --> 26:19.867
Wow, did she just pull
off a Harley exit?

26:20.050 --> 26:21.570
Where do you think he gets it from?

26:22.214 --> 26:24.115
Wait, what?

26:27.905 --> 26:29.362
Let's just say for the sake of argument

26:29.386 --> 26:30.962
that was Michelle's cyanide.

26:30.987 --> 26:33.055
She puts it in the safe and what?
Forgets about it?

26:33.080 --> 26:36.688
Not the smartest. But the big question
is, why would she want Jin dead?

26:36.713 --> 26:37.713
Alright, let's hear it.

26:37.987 --> 26:41.730
Okay, sales of Do-shita-no
have been dropping,

26:41.755 --> 26:43.959
there have been rumours that the
company's gonna be bought out.

26:43.983 --> 26:46.466
Those two well-dressed gentlemen
that we saw in front of the hotel,

26:46.490 --> 26:48.902
they've been actively
kicking the company's tires.

26:48.927 --> 26:52.352
But after Jin's death sales of
Do-shita-no have gone through the roof.

26:52.376 --> 26:55.784
Evil stepmom kills
beloved mascot... gets rich.

26:56.413 --> 26:58.814
Yeah, I dunno, I mean
Michelle seemed pissy,

26:58.849 --> 27:00.234
but she doesn't seem psychotic.

27:00.708 --> 27:03.312
Alright, no worries, let's split up.

27:03.337 --> 27:06.337
You go grill evil stepmom
I've got a half-baked idea

27:06.362 --> 27:07.616
that I wanna chase down.

27:10.718 --> 27:11.719
Feet.

27:25.791 --> 27:27.055
So no one's been in?

27:27.380 --> 27:28.461
No...

27:29.483 --> 27:30.515
Or out?

27:31.611 --> 27:33.453
How could someone come out
if I didn't let anyone in?

27:33.477 --> 27:37.190
Hahahah yeah Rafalski,
now you're thinking like a detective,

27:37.319 --> 27:38.339
I like it.

27:42.658 --> 27:46.131
Hello Dave... and "not Daves."

27:46.367 --> 27:47.434
Good to see you.

27:47.459 --> 27:49.560
So you're probably wondering
what we're doing here.

27:49.585 --> 27:50.932
No, not at all.

27:51.220 --> 27:53.455
I actually needed your
help and here you are.

27:53.480 --> 27:55.224
It's the ghost of Kiki-Loki at work.

27:55.416 --> 27:57.718
No, we've actually got some
information on the case.

27:58.041 --> 28:01.299
Terrific, because I also
have something to show you.

28:01.448 --> 28:02.471
Come on.

28:04.383 --> 28:05.984
You're saying Jin was poisoned?

28:06.011 --> 28:07.897
And the poison used was
found in your room.

28:08.577 --> 28:09.803
So that's your theory?

28:10.753 --> 28:13.117
That I forgot it was there,
and then I called the police?

28:16.247 --> 28:17.656
Why do women do that?

28:18.169 --> 28:19.176
Do what?

28:19.296 --> 28:20.996
Think that the only way to be successful

28:21.031 --> 28:23.214
is to swing a bigger dick
than all the men around them.

28:23.650 --> 28:24.964
You think that's what I'm doing?

28:25.066 --> 28:27.999
Well, yeah,
ignoring me the first time we talked,

28:28.748 --> 28:31.971
explaining business to me like
I couldn't possibly understand,

28:32.120 --> 28:34.232
telling me to get a cop who
can actually do the job...

28:34.256 --> 28:36.224
Yeah, it's feeling like a strategy.

28:36.447 --> 28:38.720
You're the one who walked
in here with a crazy theory.

28:38.916 --> 28:40.642
Well, stranger things have been true.

28:41.918 --> 28:45.387
And if it's not true,
if you took two seconds to put it back

28:45.422 --> 28:49.344
in your pants and be helpful we
could find out who killed Jin.

28:57.274 --> 28:59.942
I bet you're all wondering
why I brought you here.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.473
Usually when you say that,

29:01.507 --> 29:03.118
it's because one of us is the murderer.

29:03.219 --> 29:06.191
Are you? Because while sad, that
would really free up my afternoon.

29:08.902 --> 29:10.870
I don't think any of you are involved,

29:10.935 --> 29:13.937
but I would like you to
take a look at these

29:14.065 --> 29:17.367
and tell me what you see.

29:18.367 --> 29:20.078
A recently robbed hotel room?

29:20.436 --> 29:21.907
That's exactly what I thought.

29:22.337 --> 29:25.226
Sam and I came up here to
investigate that robbery

29:25.257 --> 29:28.426
and what we actually found
was the murder weapon

29:28.451 --> 29:30.499
in the Jin Hatanaka case.

29:30.652 --> 29:31.858
The cyanide.

29:32.243 --> 29:33.256
How'd you know that?

29:33.281 --> 29:35.782
Okay, now he definitely thinks
one of us is the murderer.

29:38.270 --> 29:39.469
Nicole.

29:39.868 --> 29:41.610
The Kiki-Club is on the case.

29:41.925 --> 29:42.953
Good work.

29:43.137 --> 29:45.289
Okay, will you all just
give me a little space?

29:45.551 --> 29:46.583
There you go.

29:46.608 --> 29:48.426
Mhm, back up, there, there we go,

29:48.451 --> 29:49.903
a little more. Okay...

29:53.291 --> 29:55.531
Red leather, yellow leather,
red leather, yellow leather.

29:57.737 --> 29:58.755
Dave...

29:59.527 --> 30:01.176
- Give me an action.
- No.

30:01.634 --> 30:03.378
- Give me an action.
- No that's ridiculous...

30:03.402 --> 30:04.843
- Dave, say action.
- You don't need to...

30:04.867 --> 30:05.874
Action!

30:25.865 --> 30:27.484
Dude! What the hell?

30:29.052 --> 30:30.070
It's all good.

30:30.095 --> 30:31.396
I made a damage deposit.

30:31.421 --> 30:33.743
Like a huge damage deposit.

30:34.462 --> 30:38.175
Now, tell me what you see.

30:38.594 --> 30:42.464
It looks almost identical
to the room in the photo.

30:42.984 --> 30:45.286
I know a set when I see one.

30:45.311 --> 30:49.056
Okay? I think they came up here
to make people believe

30:49.081 --> 30:50.901
they were gonna rob the
place, but actually,

30:50.970 --> 30:52.237
they left something behind.

30:52.621 --> 30:55.941
Something they wanted us to find.

30:58.869 --> 31:02.473
Extremely theatrical, but impressive.

31:02.728 --> 31:04.963
Question? Do you have
any idea who did it?

31:04.990 --> 31:06.035
Who broke in?

31:08.217 --> 31:09.223
No.

31:11.363 --> 31:12.371
We do.

31:14.066 --> 31:15.146
I'm sorry, what?

31:15.576 --> 31:16.630
It was the brothers.

31:17.497 --> 31:18.802
The Hughes brothers?

31:19.038 --> 31:20.728
Yeah, the security cameras caught them.

31:21.262 --> 31:24.165
We asked the hotel,
they said their cameras were broken.

31:24.606 --> 31:26.063
As I told these two...

31:26.283 --> 31:27.329
I know a guy.

31:27.610 --> 31:29.688
Well, I know hundreds of guys, Dot.

31:29.713 --> 31:31.243
You need to be a little more specific.

31:31.656 --> 31:33.690
I took a computer class with a guy

31:33.715 --> 31:36.142
who fixes the security system here.

31:36.587 --> 31:40.155
He fixed the cameras two days
ago and didn't tell the hotel

31:40.180 --> 31:41.978
so he could keep charging them.

31:43.183 --> 31:44.525
We need to tell Sam.

31:45.288 --> 31:49.368
If not me, you want to know
who else would want Jin Dead.

31:49.755 --> 31:52.149
Was there anyone who
disliked her on the set?

31:52.879 --> 31:55.109
Competitors? Give me a direction.

31:55.997 --> 31:58.979
This company's been under
a lot of pressure...

31:59.720 --> 32:04.964
After Jin's operation there was
some serious offers to buy it.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.325
But in our company,
decisions like that are made

32:07.360 --> 32:09.378
by the family, it has to be unanimous.

32:09.786 --> 32:13.737
When Jin got sick,
when it looked like Kiki-Loki was done

32:14.652 --> 32:16.276
we were ripe for takeover.

32:17.069 --> 32:19.033
The company's who wanted
to buy us were not happy

32:19.204 --> 32:21.767
with Jin's decision to
keep Kiki-Loki alive.

32:23.677 --> 32:24.740
Give me some names.

32:26.776 --> 32:27.876
Here they come.

32:31.836 --> 32:34.584
They go in and then they come
out about 10 minutes later.

32:34.609 --> 32:35.929
What do we know about these guys?

32:36.126 --> 32:37.366
That they're loud mouths.

32:37.435 --> 32:39.002
Trying very hard to look cool.

32:39.225 --> 32:40.849
I've met guys like this in LA.

32:40.874 --> 32:43.382
They talked about Do-shita-no
like it was a piece of meat.

32:43.550 --> 32:45.984
Alright, we need to track
these Hughes brothers down.

32:49.290 --> 32:50.451
But first...

32:51.569 --> 32:54.006
The brothers have been after
Do-shita-no for months.

32:54.522 --> 32:57.209
They seemed to know more about
the company than Jin did.

32:57.777 --> 33:01.724
Where it was losing money,
how to streamline production.

33:02.263 --> 33:07.020
Even after Jin said no, they were...
relentless.

33:07.420 --> 33:09.043
So if they killed Jin...

33:09.137 --> 33:11.387
There would be no Kiki-Loki.

33:11.606 --> 33:14.919
Michelle might be convinced to sell.

33:15.622 --> 33:18.317
And now that there's an active
murder investigation they try

33:18.342 --> 33:21.210
to frame Michelle making the
company even more unstable.

33:24.523 --> 33:28.085
Dai... before you were not
wearing a wedding ring

33:28.110 --> 33:29.586
and now you are.

33:31.607 --> 33:34.213
A couple of months ago
Jin and I got married.

33:34.842 --> 33:37.115
We didn't want to tell anyone.

33:38.102 --> 33:40.077
Jin was afraid people would disapprove

33:40.102 --> 33:42.383
if Kiki-Loki was married.

33:43.297 --> 33:47.074
But now all that seems foolish.

33:48.433 --> 33:51.350
And I wanted something
to remember her by.

33:56.772 --> 33:59.213
So big time business bros poison Jin

33:59.238 --> 34:01.306
so they can buy the company for cheap.

34:01.340 --> 34:04.743
- They do it here in Bishop...
- Hoping that the "backwards" cops

34:04.777 --> 34:06.878
will buy their ridiculous
frame job on Michelle.

34:06.913 --> 34:08.766
Why didn't Dai tell us he was married?

34:08.813 --> 34:11.257
You know, now that he's
married and Jin is dead

34:11.283 --> 34:13.373
he becomes a family member
that can run the company.

34:13.398 --> 34:15.455
Plus it's a little
convenient that he shows up

34:15.480 --> 34:17.273
with information on the brothers right

34:17.297 --> 34:18.889
when we need info on the brothers.

34:18.925 --> 34:20.645
You know what I usually
do right about now?

34:20.793 --> 34:22.793
I put all the suspects in one room

34:22.827 --> 34:24.561
and get one of them to confess.

34:24.585 --> 34:26.918
Yeah, I get nervous
when you say usually,

34:26.996 --> 34:28.733
because what that usually means

34:28.768 --> 34:30.268
is you're talking about your show.

34:30.303 --> 34:32.774
And don't even list off all
of the episodes it works on...

34:32.799 --> 34:34.005
Sh-sh-sh-sh-

34:34.040 --> 34:35.739
No absolutely not.

34:35.775 --> 34:37.411
We are doing this the old-fashioned way.

34:37.436 --> 34:40.065
Who is it?

34:40.091 --> 34:41.926
It's Vijay, I should take this.

34:41.951 --> 34:44.023
I'm gonna see if I can
round up the Hughes brothers

34:44.047 --> 34:45.217
and bring them in for a chat.

34:46.230 --> 34:48.295
Hey superstar!

34:48.321 --> 34:50.455
So, we have this great...

35:05.333 --> 35:08.268
Alex and Eddie, Come.

35:08.405 --> 35:10.105
Glad you decided to here us out.

35:10.365 --> 35:11.505
Yeah.

35:11.539 --> 35:13.315
And we have Michelle.

35:13.340 --> 35:15.625
You said you had something
to tell me about Jin's death?

35:15.650 --> 35:16.891
Yeah, I do.

35:17.946 --> 35:20.013
What's going on Mr. Carter?

35:20.048 --> 35:21.815
Our final guest...

35:24.467 --> 35:25.481
Dai.

35:25.553 --> 35:27.012
What is this all about?

35:27.255 --> 35:31.412
Okay, I want to personally
thank you all for being here

35:31.467 --> 35:33.653
and I bet you're wondering why...

35:33.678 --> 35:35.462
You brought us all here, yeah.

35:35.497 --> 35:40.849
But it's simple,
you each have a very good reason

35:41.256 --> 35:43.232
for wanting Jin dead.

35:43.639 --> 35:45.461
That's what this is?

35:45.727 --> 35:48.321
An Agatha Christie mystery? I'm leaving.

35:48.346 --> 35:50.500
That's exactly what
the killer would say.

35:52.296 --> 35:57.849
Alex and Eddie,
you have been trying really really hard

35:57.874 --> 36:01.099
to buy this company, but Jin refused.

36:01.458 --> 36:02.497
So we killed her?

36:02.757 --> 36:03.847
That's ridiculous.

36:03.872 --> 36:05.626
We're here to get her to reconsider.

36:05.868 --> 36:08.619
We have evidence of you
breaking into the hotel room

36:08.659 --> 36:10.913
where we found the
poison that killed her.

36:11.097 --> 36:12.164
What?

36:12.189 --> 36:13.266
Room 213?

36:13.508 --> 36:16.415
No-no-no, someone asked
us to come to that room.

36:18.126 --> 36:20.835
Yeah, we let ourselves in, but whoever
they were, they never showed.

36:21.276 --> 36:24.144
What is a Kuchiku-Kan?

36:26.256 --> 36:27.304
It's a code name.

36:27.491 --> 36:29.146
For months now, they've been feeding us

36:29.171 --> 36:31.663
all of Do-shita-no's
financial statements.

36:31.886 --> 36:34.822
And strategies about how
to convince Jin to sell.

36:36.224 --> 36:41.361
Okay, so, so someone inside the
company was helping you buy it?

36:41.510 --> 36:43.361
Destroy the company.

36:43.998 --> 36:46.266
Kuchiku-Kan means destroyer.

36:48.909 --> 36:52.884
Dai, now that we know you
and Jin were married,

36:53.331 --> 36:56.032
if the company were to be sold
you would benefit tremendously.

36:56.057 --> 36:57.896
You were married?

36:58.050 --> 36:59.551
That's how this company works, right?

36:59.576 --> 37:02.006
It's owned equally by
all the family members.

37:02.250 --> 37:04.043
Now that Kiki-Loki is gone

37:04.068 --> 37:05.615
there's no reason to keep the company.

37:05.732 --> 37:09.314
All you'd have to do is
convince Michelle to sell.

37:10.992 --> 37:12.056
I loved Jin.

37:18.433 --> 37:19.481
Okay.

37:20.501 --> 37:22.131
Who else benefits?

37:23.225 --> 37:28.052
Who's been working overtime
to sell this company?

37:33.181 --> 37:37.460
Well, now we have a handwriting
sample of this Kuchiku-Kan.

37:39.173 --> 37:40.241
Michelle?

37:40.851 --> 37:43.123
You've been working
in secret for months,

37:43.148 --> 37:45.466
and just when this deal
was about to happen

37:46.341 --> 37:49.196
Jin announced that she was
gonna be Kiki-Loki again.

37:49.797 --> 37:51.631
You need to think about tomorrow.

37:51.944 --> 37:55.385
Kiki-Loki must never die.

37:59.073 --> 38:00.084
I agree.

38:03.878 --> 38:05.712
And you made a terrible decision.

38:08.071 --> 38:10.063
Do you know what it's
like to live in the shadow

38:10.104 --> 38:11.650
of some character?

38:12.627 --> 38:14.914
Watch your husband waste his money,

38:14.939 --> 38:18.095
our money on a ridiculous fantasy?

38:19.472 --> 38:21.129
When he died, when Jin got sick.

38:22.050 --> 38:25.599
I thought all that time I
put in finally paid off.

38:28.169 --> 38:29.310
Let's get in there.

38:30.605 --> 38:32.593
You did not anticipate this?

38:32.807 --> 38:35.208
Well I thought she was a poisoner...

38:36.844 --> 38:37.953
I'm leaving.

38:39.256 --> 38:41.114
Don't follow me.

38:43.187 --> 38:44.202
Get away from me!

38:44.352 --> 38:45.507
Put the gun down.

38:47.121 --> 38:48.757
You cannot kill Kiki-Loki.

38:48.956 --> 38:50.713
Michelle, put that gun down.

38:50.958 --> 38:52.926
Yeah, that would be a good idea.

38:52.960 --> 38:53.960
Sam!

38:54.996 --> 38:58.932
Michelle put the gun down now.

38:59.534 --> 39:02.488
If you shoot me,
she will blow your head off.

39:03.337 --> 39:04.538
Michelle!

39:13.881 --> 39:14.890
Hey Dot.

39:15.850 --> 39:18.517
I told you to wait until I needed help.

39:18.729 --> 39:20.329
She had a gun pointed at you.

39:20.354 --> 39:22.856
You want to wait until you
have a hole in your chest?

39:22.890 --> 39:24.357
Any idea how Sam got here?

39:24.392 --> 39:25.694
I called her.

39:26.296 --> 39:29.007
See, even Kiki-Loki needs back-up.

39:29.497 --> 39:31.298
Not as much as you, Harley.

39:35.519 --> 39:36.729
Dot got to wear the suit?

39:40.086 --> 39:41.167
It's okay.

39:48.883 --> 39:51.397
Tomorrow, none of this happened.

39:52.487 --> 39:54.387
Okay, we didn't bond.

39:54.422 --> 39:57.304
You didn't show me your soft underbelly.

39:57.882 --> 40:00.585
You didn't put on the costume
and solve a crime, got it.

40:01.529 --> 40:04.571
The director said he
would find a new Kiki-Loki

40:04.596 --> 40:05.971
to keep Jin alive.

40:07.068 --> 40:10.971
Well, you should audition,
you were a pretty good Kiki-Loki.

40:14.342 --> 40:17.481
Next time you do that I
will break your thumb.

40:20.715 --> 40:21.731
Okay.

40:25.512 --> 40:28.284
Hey I know things went
south pretty fast,

40:28.309 --> 40:31.308
but thanks a lot for
bringing me that commercial.

40:32.550 --> 40:34.760
The silver lining is
you now have thousands

40:34.785 --> 40:37.751
of new Kiki-Loki fans.

40:40.802 --> 40:42.068
Listen Vijay...

40:44.659 --> 40:48.208
Thanks for trying to keep the
whole Carter thing alive in LA.

40:51.813 --> 40:55.015
But I think I'm ready to
stop being Charlie Carter.

40:58.419 --> 40:59.419
I know.

41:01.193 --> 41:05.956
But before you decide,
before you take years

41:05.981 --> 41:08.028
and years of commission
out of my pocket...

41:10.859 --> 41:12.195
I think you should read this.

41:12.934 --> 41:15.445
It's the first episode of the
next season of Call Carter.

41:15.870 --> 41:16.872
Vijay...

41:16.897 --> 41:19.065
No-no, it's not just another
body of the week, Harley.

41:19.574 --> 41:23.860
Next season Charlie Carter finds
out who really killed his mom.

41:26.078 --> 41:27.118
It's good.

41:27.648 --> 41:28.792
It's really good.

41:30.251 --> 41:33.261
Just give it a read, okay?
