02:50.672 --> 02:53.508
Hi. Can I have some
mashed potatoes, please?

02:58.137 --> 02:59.430
No protein?

02:59.597 --> 03:01.516
No thanks. No meat.

03:09.774 --> 03:10.775
What?

03:11.943 --> 03:12.944
What's wrong?

03:13.319 --> 03:14.779
Spit it out.

03:19.117 --> 03:20.159
Shit.

03:20.285 --> 03:21.911
- Did you bite into it?
- No.

03:21.995 --> 03:24.038
- Sure?
- Look. No.

03:24.122 --> 03:25.832
This shit really gets me.

03:25.957 --> 03:27.834
Mom, it's fine.
Forget it.

03:27.959 --> 03:29.794
Seriously?
And if you were allergic?

03:39.470 --> 03:40.471
You want mine?

03:41.180 --> 03:42.307
No, thanks.

03:43.141 --> 03:44.809
My daughter had meat.

03:45.685 --> 03:47.478
It's unacceptable.
We're vegetarians.

04:40.615 --> 04:42.450
Wow, it looks shabbier.

04:42.533 --> 04:43.868
Don't you think?

04:53.711 --> 04:54.879
Is that it?

04:55.880 --> 04:57.465
No, that's the med faculty.

04:57.548 --> 05:00.593
Hospital on the left, morgue next to it.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.429
And the grocery store, look.

05:04.138 --> 05:05.556
I'm already lost.

05:21.656 --> 05:23.616
- You have your phone?
- Yeah.

05:23.741 --> 05:26.244
Call your sister.
She may answer for you.

05:33.751 --> 05:35.211
I'm going.
She won't come.

05:35.294 --> 05:38.172
Are you nuts?
We're not leaving Juju on her own!

05:38.506 --> 05:40.258
She said she'd pick her up.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.844
Wait a bit, she may come.

05:42.969 --> 05:44.137
So, brainiac,

05:45.763 --> 05:48.099
show 'em what you can do.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.767
OK? See you.

05:52.770 --> 05:54.147
I love you, baby.

05:55.106 --> 05:56.524
- Call me.
- Yeah.

05:57.108 --> 05:59.110
Love you too, Mommy.

06:41.194 --> 06:42.695
What's that shit music?

06:42.820 --> 06:43.821
Beats me. Who are you?

06:43.905 --> 06:45.490
Roommate.
I got here late. Up!

06:46.699 --> 06:47.742
You're not a girl.

06:47.825 --> 06:48.910
Nope.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.620
I asked for a girl.

06:50.703 --> 06:52.872
They gave you a fag,
same deal for them.

06:52.997 --> 06:54.040
Here, take this.

06:54.165 --> 06:55.833
What's going on? What's this?

06:56.334 --> 06:57.502
A ski pole.

07:15.770 --> 07:17.355
That's my shit!

07:21.859 --> 07:23.402
Hey! Where are you going?

07:23.528 --> 07:24.529
Where?

07:24.904 --> 07:25.988
Bed, man.

07:26.072 --> 07:28.866
Bed? Where? Your bed's downstairs, friend.

07:30.201 --> 07:32.912
Check it. This one wants out already!

07:33.037 --> 07:35.706
You got in to please your parents, right?

07:35.873 --> 07:36.999
I thought it was over.

07:37.083 --> 07:39.168
You'll know if it's over, big guy.

07:39.252 --> 07:40.336
Get back in line.

07:40.419 --> 07:41.462
Get in line.

07:41.796 --> 07:44.382
And now, where are we headed?

07:45.550 --> 07:46.717
Where?

07:48.052 --> 07:49.637
- To freedom!
- Fuck off!

07:49.720 --> 07:51.305
Fuckers!

07:51.389 --> 07:54.433
Speed it up, rookies!

07:55.059 --> 07:56.102
Assholes.

07:56.227 --> 07:59.605
Get up! Move your asses!
Hurry, the boss is waiting.

07:59.897 --> 08:02.733
- Move it!
- Come on, guys.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.404
Faster, rookies!

08:11.159 --> 08:12.660
Move down!

08:23.504 --> 08:25.590
Move your asses!

08:25.673 --> 08:27.133
You! You stay put.

08:27.258 --> 08:29.177
Go. Go. Move it. Move it.

08:29.427 --> 08:30.678
Rookies, move it!

08:30.761 --> 08:34.015
Get moving, go, go!

09:25.816 --> 09:29.570
Hey, it's just a game.
What do you think could happen?

09:31.989 --> 09:33.199
I'm Adrien.

09:34.033 --> 09:35.076
Justine.

10:00.768 --> 10:01.852
Slut it up, girls.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.187
You're the slut.

11:18.846 --> 11:19.930
Alex!

11:35.613 --> 11:36.655
Alex!

11:42.995 --> 11:44.622
I'm so wasted.

11:45.039 --> 11:47.958
Where were you? Mom and Dad will kill you.

11:48.209 --> 11:49.710
It's so cool you're here.

11:49.794 --> 11:53.089
You'll love it. The first year is the best.

11:53.172 --> 11:56.717
And we'll see each other
all the time, like at home.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.221
Is my thong out of my shorts?

12:01.305 --> 12:02.515
You're fine.

12:06.644 --> 12:09.271
Mom got to you, I see.
Was it hell without me?

12:09.355 --> 12:10.564
What do you mean?

12:13.818 --> 12:14.819
Fuck.

12:15.569 --> 12:16.904
I need some fresh air.

12:17.905 --> 12:18.989
Quicky!

12:19.198 --> 12:20.991
Long time, no see!

12:49.437 --> 12:53.190
- Where's the light?
- Don't. We're not allowed in here.

12:55.693 --> 12:56.694
Where are we?

13:01.115 --> 13:02.199
Alex?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.247
Where do I go now?

13:09.290 --> 13:10.541
Fuck, bumped my eye!

13:18.632 --> 13:19.717
Where are you?

13:27.892 --> 13:28.934
Stop it!

13:29.059 --> 13:30.060
Look.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.531
Some heads are cut off.

13:42.615 --> 13:45.075
Traitors. They refused initiation.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.669
Here it is, come look.

14:01.509 --> 14:03.260
Who's that?

14:05.012 --> 14:08.140
No way. They wouldn't do that kind of thing.

14:08.265 --> 14:10.434
It's tradition. You will too, right.

14:10.518 --> 14:11.560
Really?

14:11.644 --> 14:14.438
Don't be a wimp. Even Mom looks happy.

14:14.939 --> 14:18.275
Poor Dad, it's all over him.
You can't see his face.

14:20.194 --> 14:21.278
Are you cold?

14:21.445 --> 14:24.114
I'm going back to dance. Watch Quicky?

14:24.782 --> 14:26.367
I'm going to bed, I'm dead.

14:26.450 --> 14:27.743
No way!

14:27.826 --> 14:30.538
- Why?
- Rookies don't go to bed before us.

14:59.483 --> 15:02.319
My roommate's sleeping. Come with me.

15:05.489 --> 15:06.490
Wait.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.170
Ketamine.

16:02.046 --> 16:03.047
Let's try it.

16:07.301 --> 16:08.719
Move it up.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.267
OK. Take the brace.

16:27.112 --> 16:29.948
A student for the strut,
a cushion for the head.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.795
<i>Vets, they march ahead</i>

16:42.920 --> 16:45.130
<i>Their dicks up proud in the air</i>

16:45.255 --> 16:49.677
<i>Cuz a vet will fuck you anywhere</i>

16:50.469 --> 16:54.264
<i>They are men - yes sir!
With giant balls, for her</i>

16:54.973 --> 16:58.227
<i>They like a laugh, they like a drink,
they like to screw and we do too!</i>

16:58.310 --> 17:01.271
<i>Oh yes, they do, and we do too</i>

17:24.378 --> 17:26.380
71st graduating class
St. Expuery School of Veterinary Medicine

17:26.463 --> 17:27.464
September 2015

17:27.548 --> 17:28.632
Conscripts!

17:29.883 --> 17:33.178
You have made it to our great school.
We applaud you.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.889
Your profs will make you
the best vets out there.

17:36.348 --> 17:38.726
Your elders will make you family.

17:39.017 --> 17:43.021
But first you must learn.

17:43.147 --> 17:48.402
Learn to be a team,
to obey, to be good rookies.

17:48.485 --> 17:53.824
From now on, you will call your elders
either 'elders' or 'great ones.'

17:53.907 --> 17:55.743
Repeat after me: Elders.

17:55.826 --> 17:57.911
- Elders.
- Hey! Elders.

17:57.995 --> 17:59.037
Elders.

17:59.163 --> 18:00.330
Good. And great ones.

18:00.414 --> 18:01.457
Great ones.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.834
What a nice bunch this year. Where was I?

18:04.334 --> 18:09.673
They'll help you during your rush week,
which will end when you hear this:

18:11.508 --> 18:12.509
For real?

18:13.427 --> 18:15.179
When you hear. Yeah.

18:17.181 --> 18:19.975
Then and only then
are you no longer rookies.

18:20.058 --> 18:22.478
In the meantime, we're counting on you.

18:22.561 --> 18:24.730
Make us proud. We'll show you the way.

18:24.855 --> 18:25.856
Vets!

18:33.447 --> 18:35.115
Longest wait ever for an open bar.

18:35.199 --> 18:36.241
What is it?

18:36.366 --> 18:37.367
Wait your turn.

18:37.451 --> 18:38.494
Is it meat?

18:38.577 --> 18:40.037
Rabbit kidney. Better not to know.

18:40.204 --> 18:43.081
I'm a vegetarian, I can't eat that.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.417
Ask my sister, our family's veggie.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.669
- Who's your sister?
- Alexia.

18:47.753 --> 18:48.796
No shit.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.965
Alex? Come here a sec.

18:53.217 --> 18:54.718
- You vegetarian?
- No. Why?

18:55.093 --> 18:56.136
She your sister?

18:57.054 --> 18:59.056
Call my parents if you don't trust me.

18:59.431 --> 19:02.226
Are you serious?
It's nothing. Everybody does it.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.560
So eat hers then.

19:03.644 --> 19:04.812
I ate mine last year.

19:04.895 --> 19:06.230
That's why I'm here now.

19:06.730 --> 19:07.940
Go on, eat it.

19:19.576 --> 19:20.911
See? Easy.

19:26.583 --> 19:27.584
Open up.

19:28.919 --> 19:30.587
You'll be happy you did it.

19:33.674 --> 19:36.677
Don't start the year by chickening out.
They're watching.

20:00.325 --> 20:04.788
Maybe not all animals, but monkeys.

20:05.289 --> 20:06.957
It comes from them.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.127
Do you think a monkey can get AIDS today?

20:10.794 --> 20:12.379
If you treat a monkey

20:12.462 --> 20:14.381
in a zoo or African reserve,

20:14.631 --> 20:17.259
are you as careful as a doctor
doing normal surgery?

20:17.342 --> 20:20.762
No clue.
Why are you thinking about this shit?

20:20.846 --> 20:23.348
Take a guy who wants to fuck a monkey.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.934
The theory is AIDS started that way.

20:26.018 --> 20:29.104
If a guy wants to fuck a monkey today,

20:29.187 --> 20:30.856
should he use a condom?

20:30.981 --> 20:35.444
I'm eating, man!
Don't talk about fucking monkeys.

20:35.527 --> 20:37.070
Did wolves raise you?

20:37.487 --> 20:38.989
What do I care?

20:39.072 --> 20:40.991
Cuz I fuck monkeys or have AIDS?

20:42.200 --> 20:43.243
What the fuck.

20:43.660 --> 20:46.830
OK, sorry. It was a valid question.

20:47.331 --> 20:50.334
They only ate monkeys.
The rest was made up.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.461
Who'd be so sick he'd rape an animal?

20:52.544 --> 20:53.587
Lots of people.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.674
Legally, I'm not sure "monkey rape" exists.

20:57.883 --> 20:59.718
Sure it does. Animals have rights.

20:59.843 --> 21:03.597
The monkey won't turn
anorexic and see a therapist.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.390
It's not the same.

21:05.515 --> 21:07.559
Monkeys are self-aware.

21:07.726 --> 21:10.354
They see themselves, in a mirror, right?

21:10.771 --> 21:13.523
I bet a raped monkey suffers like a woman.

21:13.607 --> 21:15.067
So a raped woman,

21:15.192 --> 21:16.860
raped monkey, same thing?

21:18.862 --> 21:20.197
Yeah.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.786
What I'm saying isn't so crazy.

21:26.536 --> 21:28.372
Why are we in vet school?

21:57.943 --> 21:59.319
Unbelievable.

22:02.322 --> 22:04.241
It's easy, really.

22:16.253 --> 22:17.504
I expected no less from you.

22:18.422 --> 22:20.966
Let's see if your reputation is earned.

22:23.010 --> 22:24.928
One mistake already.

22:25.929 --> 22:27.014
Off to a bad start.

22:27.764 --> 22:28.807
May I?

22:28.932 --> 22:30.183
No. Too late.

22:30.600 --> 22:31.768
There.

23:34.164 --> 23:36.500
- Hey. Are you OK?
- Yeah. Stay out.

25:09.176 --> 25:10.594
Oh, that is bad.

25:11.094 --> 25:12.596
Any allergies?

25:12.846 --> 25:13.930
I don't think so.

25:14.431 --> 25:15.473
OK.

25:17.851 --> 25:19.436
Will I get it on my face?

25:19.936 --> 25:23.106
No, no. It won't last long. It's already peeling.

25:24.608 --> 25:26.443
- Any nausea?
- Yeah.

25:26.776 --> 25:27.903
Since when?

25:27.986 --> 25:29.029
At the same time.

25:29.446 --> 25:30.947
OK. Last period?

25:32.324 --> 25:33.366
I'm not sure.

25:33.491 --> 25:35.285
A week or two?

25:35.869 --> 25:37.495
OK. Are you on the pill?

25:37.621 --> 25:38.663
No.

25:39.956 --> 25:41.625
Do you use condoms?

25:41.708 --> 25:43.793
I've never...

25:45.003 --> 25:46.046
Right.

25:47.130 --> 25:48.298
OK.

25:48.632 --> 25:50.634
Ouch.

25:52.052 --> 25:54.387
And this is your rush week?

25:55.388 --> 25:57.307
OK. I think

25:57.390 --> 26:01.102
it's food poisoning
and you're having a reaction.

26:01.186 --> 26:04.648
Drink lots of liquids. Water, that is.

26:04.731 --> 26:07.609
Avoid solids. Fast a whole day, even.

26:07.692 --> 26:09.069
I'll get you a cream.

26:09.152 --> 26:12.405
I am hungry though.
My stomach always feels empty.

26:12.489 --> 26:13.531
Yeah.

26:14.199 --> 26:15.825
What'd they give you?

26:15.909 --> 26:17.369
Raw rabbit kidneys.

26:19.037 --> 26:22.540
Someone tells you to eat
raw rabbit kidney, and you do?

26:22.749 --> 26:24.584
- I said no.
- Did they force you?

26:25.252 --> 26:26.294
No.

26:26.378 --> 26:27.420
OK. Keep it.

26:27.504 --> 26:29.673
- Use it three times a day.
- Thanks.

26:32.884 --> 26:35.220
I used to work at the hospital here.

26:35.887 --> 26:39.099
One day, they sent a girl your age
for blood tests.

26:40.225 --> 26:42.102
She was round.

26:45.855 --> 26:47.607
Fat, actually.

26:48.358 --> 26:50.568
A really nice girl, really sweet.

26:50.694 --> 26:53.530
Some freak out over needles, but not her.

26:54.948 --> 26:57.242
She had a ton of tests to do.

26:57.701 --> 26:59.244
So it goes well.

26:59.452 --> 27:01.871
She gets dressed and bursts into tears.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.124
I ask what's wrong and she says

27:04.207 --> 27:07.377
I'm the first person
to not mention her weight.

27:09.045 --> 27:10.297
Why would I?

27:10.922 --> 27:13.383
The test was totally unrelated.

27:13.967 --> 27:16.761
She said the interns sent her ward to ward,

27:16.886 --> 27:21.057
saying they couldn't jab her
due to the fat on her arms.

27:23.727 --> 27:25.895
They said to lose weight and come back.

27:27.439 --> 27:29.232
Can you imagine?

27:29.441 --> 27:32.235
Nonsense. I'd had no trouble finding a vein.

27:32.736 --> 27:34.404
Why didn't she report it?

27:35.447 --> 27:38.658
Why? Don't know.
To not bother anyone, I guess.

27:38.742 --> 27:41.453
She kind of stood out.

27:41.619 --> 27:44.914
She probably wanted to be average.

27:46.249 --> 27:47.667
How do you see yourself?

27:48.918 --> 27:50.003
Average.

27:51.254 --> 27:53.631
Find yourself a quiet corner. Wait it out.

27:53.757 --> 27:55.508
The year always starts out rough.

28:10.273 --> 28:12.942
Eyes to the floor for an elder, rookie!

28:15.028 --> 28:17.280
You wearing that? You didn't hear today?

28:17.364 --> 28:18.406
Hear what?

28:18.490 --> 28:20.617
The dress code is night club. Go change.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.285
Girls wear something hot.

28:22.494 --> 28:24.162
Not t-shirts with sequins.

28:24.287 --> 28:25.538
This is all I have.

28:25.622 --> 28:27.957
- Is that a no?
- I'll have to look.

28:28.333 --> 28:30.460
OK. Uniform then.

28:41.554 --> 28:42.639
Can I help you?

28:43.640 --> 28:46.142
Come in. Hurry up.

28:47.060 --> 28:50.480
Here you have the septate uterus,

28:51.147 --> 28:54.442
characterized by its long horns

28:54.526 --> 28:57.904
and gradual narrowing
toward the fallopian tubes.

29:04.411 --> 29:06.162
Too small.

29:07.330 --> 29:09.499
No way you're having that.

29:10.542 --> 29:13.503
If you'd spoken up,
I wouldn't have had to eat it.

29:13.586 --> 29:16.923
Let it go! It was that or you were a reject.

29:17.257 --> 29:19.759
It's your life! I shouldn't have helped.

29:19.843 --> 29:21.261
You didn't!

29:27.016 --> 29:28.017
I'm being nice.

29:28.101 --> 29:30.520
You'll stretch them with your big feet.

29:33.731 --> 29:35.942
Come here! I'm not your slave!

29:38.695 --> 29:40.780
Your handwriting is awful.

29:40.864 --> 29:41.906
What?

29:42.031 --> 29:43.741
Do you write on the washer?

29:44.075 --> 29:45.243
Hands off!

29:45.368 --> 29:48.913
I just fixed a couple things.
Small errors, mostly.

29:49.956 --> 29:51.749
Take what you need and scram.

29:54.711 --> 29:56.880
- Move.
- Can I try it on?

30:01.384 --> 30:02.427
Quick.

30:18.735 --> 30:20.403
It's not me.

30:20.737 --> 30:22.155
OK, get out.

30:22.238 --> 30:23.406
- Like this?
- Yeah.

30:24.782 --> 30:25.950
You piss me off.

30:27.327 --> 30:28.411
See you.

31:11.788 --> 31:13.206
Fuck this!

31:30.223 --> 31:31.641
Could you help me with...

31:36.062 --> 31:37.146
Don't stop. So good.

31:55.248 --> 31:57.250
- That's pork.
- So?

32:12.849 --> 32:14.183
Grab some ketchup.

32:31.534 --> 32:33.286
What's in your pocket?

32:34.203 --> 32:35.246
Sorry?

32:35.413 --> 32:37.749
Your lab coat. There. Show me.

32:38.416 --> 32:40.501
Problem solved.

32:40.585 --> 32:42.253
I need to see to ring it up.

32:51.095 --> 32:53.931
Stealing a burger's fucked up,
even for me. You need cash?

32:54.599 --> 32:55.975
Did anyone see?

32:56.434 --> 32:58.561
Nah. Own it. Why that?

33:00.897 --> 33:01.898
Don't know.

33:05.276 --> 33:07.487
I'm starving. It'll be awesome.

33:07.737 --> 33:08.780
It's stupid.

33:08.905 --> 33:10.615
It's a first, we need to celebrate.

33:11.741 --> 33:13.743
- It's on me.
- Great.

34:06.671 --> 34:08.423
What's your sister's problem?

34:08.506 --> 34:11.008
- What problem?
- Let's sit over there.

34:11.175 --> 34:13.469
I don't know, she's not exactly friendly.

34:13.803 --> 34:15.972
What do you know? You barely talk to her.

34:16.222 --> 34:18.391
Neither have you, since you arrived.

34:26.816 --> 34:28.234
I can't if you watch.

34:30.820 --> 34:33.531
Say that you kill a guy's hard-on for life.

34:36.826 --> 34:39.078
It's so bullshit to sell booze at rest stops.

34:39.996 --> 34:41.372
Check the bigwigs.

34:41.998 --> 34:44.333
Big rigs, you mean. Wig's different.

34:44.500 --> 34:47.211
Big wigs are like VIPs or something.

34:48.504 --> 34:52.550
OK. Even with an hour's sleep,
you're still drunk.

34:53.509 --> 34:57.513
Do you think they swap blood
or inject water, like cyclists?

34:58.222 --> 34:59.599
Ask him yourself.

35:00.016 --> 35:01.559
Where you kids off to?

35:03.019 --> 35:06.189
Just having some shawarma.
Then back to campus.

35:06.564 --> 35:08.524
You're at the vet school?

35:09.525 --> 35:14.113
I came down there once with my pig,
he had the flu.

35:15.448 --> 35:18.534
Flu's bad for pigs. But he's better now.

35:21.788 --> 35:24.540
- You have a pig in your truck?
- Yeah.

35:25.291 --> 35:28.419
We all do. To swap our boozer blood.

35:29.712 --> 35:33.382
Pigs are almost like humans.
Have you learned that yet?

35:33.883 --> 35:35.760
Genetically, or something.

35:42.141 --> 35:44.393
Well kiddos, enjoy your meal.

35:45.311 --> 35:48.314
Little lady's hungry.
Don't they feed you down there?

35:51.567 --> 35:53.945
School's good. You're lucky.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.252
You're up?

36:11.170 --> 36:12.755
For breakfast.

36:13.756 --> 36:15.591
Putting on a barbecue?

36:19.846 --> 36:20.930
What do you eat?

36:21.806 --> 36:22.849
Cereal.

36:24.141 --> 36:25.184
Cereal's up there.

36:26.102 --> 36:27.770
I'm just getting milk, OK?

36:50.710 --> 36:52.336
So you cheated.

36:52.461 --> 36:53.462
No.

36:53.796 --> 36:55.631
You admit your friend did.

36:55.715 --> 36:56.799
No.

36:57.800 --> 37:00.595
Miss, I don't have a soft spot
for top students,

37:00.678 --> 37:03.347
unlike all my colleagues,

37:04.307 --> 37:07.018
I feel more sympathy
for your friend than you.

37:07.560 --> 37:10.813
School is tough for him.
He has to fight to stay.

37:11.063 --> 37:12.315
But you,

37:12.857 --> 37:14.150
the wonder child,

37:14.400 --> 37:17.153
you ride in and depress my students.

37:17.403 --> 37:21.032
Some would sooner drop out
than compare themselves to you.

37:21.324 --> 37:23.409
You aren't needed here.

37:23.993 --> 37:26.495
Worse, you scare away excellent doctors.

37:26.829 --> 37:27.872
As you can guess,

37:27.997 --> 37:33.336
I'd rather see your ranking drop
than your friend's.

37:38.925 --> 37:40.009
It was him.

38:43.948 --> 38:47.118
Two fingers will make it come up faster.

39:07.346 --> 39:08.431
Alex!

39:08.848 --> 39:09.932
Hey!

39:11.100 --> 39:12.101
Alex!

39:13.978 --> 39:15.021
Can we talk?

39:15.146 --> 39:16.188
Can't hear you!

39:16.439 --> 39:17.440
We have to talk.

39:17.773 --> 39:18.774
Afterwards!

39:28.826 --> 39:31.412
One time I made out with a one-armed guy.

39:31.495 --> 39:32.538
No way.

39:32.663 --> 39:35.624
Yeah. It took me two hours to notice.

39:36.125 --> 39:40.504
You know, he draped a blazer
over his shoulder.

39:40.629 --> 39:44.633
I thought,
OK, country club, must have money.

39:45.342 --> 39:47.636
But no, he just had one arm.

39:51.348 --> 39:52.391
Alex?

39:53.809 --> 39:55.644
Do you think I'm weird?

39:56.312 --> 39:58.230
What? No! Why?

39:58.898 --> 40:00.816
You know you're the favorite.

40:01.150 --> 40:03.903
I'm the weirdo in the family.
Always have been.

40:07.490 --> 40:09.867
What are you doing? What the fuck?

40:12.995 --> 40:15.873
Hips pushed out, see. And go!

40:15.998 --> 40:17.333
No hands.

40:17.666 --> 40:19.001
How do you do that?

40:19.085 --> 40:22.505
Go on, let's see how far you shoot.

40:22.588 --> 40:25.591
Push hard to get
a strong stream and it works.

40:28.094 --> 40:30.054
I'll go all over myself.

40:30.179 --> 40:32.056
Deep breath...

40:32.515 --> 40:35.518
Fuck! I'm pissing on myself!

40:36.018 --> 40:37.728
Normal squat! Normal squat!

40:38.521 --> 40:39.855
I'm still peeing.

40:41.857 --> 40:42.900
Damn!

40:44.235 --> 40:45.861
So gross.

40:51.742 --> 40:53.410
Let's go, it's raining.

40:54.954 --> 40:57.623
Can I sleep over? I don't feel well.

40:58.082 --> 41:00.417
You never feel well, ever.

41:43.085 --> 41:44.461
What? What's wrong?

41:48.090 --> 41:49.091
Stay still.

41:52.094 --> 41:53.095
Better?

41:54.263 --> 41:56.348
Looks the same to me.

41:58.934 --> 42:01.812
At your age, I already gave myself Brazilians.

42:02.021 --> 42:03.105
What's that?

42:34.303 --> 42:36.347
It's scorching. Will it hurt a lot?

42:36.847 --> 42:38.224
Beauty is pain.

42:49.860 --> 42:51.237
I'm amazing.

42:52.154 --> 42:53.155
No, I can't.

42:53.239 --> 42:54.823
And leave it like that? It's uneven.

42:54.907 --> 42:56.450
No, this is torture.

42:56.533 --> 42:59.995
Great, now it's worse.
Let me do the other side at least.

43:07.670 --> 43:09.380
Tell me when you're...
Ow!

43:12.383 --> 43:13.759
Come on. We all do it.

43:27.940 --> 43:28.983
Shit.

43:29.066 --> 43:30.818
What? Tell me.

43:30.901 --> 43:32.236
- Odd
- It's stuck?

43:32.361 --> 43:34.363
- I don't know.
- What's Plan B?

43:34.863 --> 43:36.282
This is weird. Wait.

43:40.536 --> 43:41.537
Get away!

43:42.705 --> 43:44.581
- You'll circumcise me!
- We have to.

43:46.542 --> 43:47.584
You're shaking.

43:48.210 --> 43:49.878
It's my pussy!

43:51.630 --> 43:52.715
What?

43:53.757 --> 43:54.800
What? What is it?

44:03.058 --> 44:05.769
Alex! Hey! Hey!

44:13.235 --> 44:14.945
My sister cut her finger.

44:16.071 --> 44:17.489
With scissors.

44:19.325 --> 44:21.827
Cutting something, who cares!

44:23.996 --> 44:25.080
15 minutes?

44:25.622 --> 44:27.249
Ice? OK, I know.

44:28.584 --> 44:29.585
OK.

48:14.810 --> 48:17.020
- Anyone seen you for the prosthesis?
- What?

48:17.396 --> 48:19.815
- Didn't they sew it back on?
- Nope.

48:20.524 --> 48:22.484
Quicky ate my finger.

48:23.819 --> 48:25.362
The doctor will be by soon.

48:25.487 --> 48:27.739
What about her rehab?
How does it work?

48:28.490 --> 48:30.534
No nerve damage, no rehab.
There's no point.

48:30.867 --> 48:33.161
You're leaving her like this? Really?

48:33.245 --> 48:34.371
She can't eat!

48:34.496 --> 48:36.707
- I'm not disabled.
- Yes, you are!

48:36.832 --> 48:38.750
- You'd like that!
- Don't say that.

48:39.001 --> 48:40.419
Shit, leave her alone!

48:40.711 --> 48:43.714
Don't talk to your mother that way.
What's wrong?

48:45.674 --> 48:46.717
I'm going to piss.

48:46.842 --> 48:47.843
Me too.

48:48.176 --> 48:49.678
What the hell? Ow.

48:53.682 --> 48:54.725
Ouch!

49:38.101 --> 49:39.561
Apologize to your mother.

49:39.770 --> 49:41.480
I'm not going back in there.

49:42.064 --> 49:43.315
Do you smoke?

49:43.940 --> 49:44.983
Yeah.

49:50.238 --> 49:51.615
Who has Quicky?

49:52.115 --> 49:54.159
He'll be put down, if not already.

49:54.242 --> 49:56.620
Why? He didn't attack her. That's cruel!

49:56.912 --> 50:00.666
They have to. An animal that has tasted
human flesh isn't safe.

50:00.749 --> 50:02.751
If he likes it, he'll bite again.

50:03.251 --> 50:05.087
Can't he just take a pill?

50:05.253 --> 50:08.256
Medicine's not an exact science. You'll see.

50:11.927 --> 50:14.513
Don't have two girls, honey. It's too hard.

50:37.285 --> 50:39.287
Mom and Dad still here?

50:39.371 --> 50:40.455
No.

50:46.628 --> 50:49.715
- Where are you going?
- We... We need to talk.

50:59.516 --> 51:00.684
Here's good.

51:16.491 --> 51:17.659
You wanted to talk?

51:17.743 --> 51:18.785
What about?

51:18.869 --> 51:20.746
- You asked.
- Something to say?

51:21.371 --> 51:24.166
No, you brought me out here.

51:24.374 --> 51:25.417
So?

51:26.001 --> 51:27.085
I've nothing to say.

51:27.335 --> 51:29.880
Stop mind fucking me then! You're like Mom!

51:30.839 --> 51:32.507
You sound like Mom.

51:41.767 --> 51:43.518
If we're here for deer, I'll kill you.

51:43.935 --> 51:45.395
You're so aggressive.

51:45.520 --> 51:47.022
No, I'm not.

51:47.105 --> 51:48.523
Anger management issues!

51:48.607 --> 51:49.858
- I'm not angry!
- Stay here!

51:50.066 --> 51:51.109
Alex!

52:09.211 --> 52:10.253
Alex?

52:12.214 --> 52:13.256
Are you OK?

52:35.070 --> 52:36.696
What's wrong with you?

52:36.780 --> 52:38.949
Nice, yell at me now.

53:01.346 --> 53:02.430
Shit.

53:06.601 --> 53:08.603
Don't! What are you doing?

53:09.187 --> 53:10.272
Stop.

53:10.856 --> 53:12.941
Why are you opening the door?

53:18.321 --> 53:19.656
He won't make it.

53:33.837 --> 53:35.171
Spit it out!

53:35.380 --> 53:36.798
I said, spit!

53:37.048 --> 53:38.300
Fuck! Are you kidding?

53:38.383 --> 53:40.385
I did this for you, idiot!

53:40.468 --> 53:42.137
You need to learn, right?

54:32.729 --> 54:34.356
What did I miss?

54:35.774 --> 54:37.609
Do me up.

54:56.962 --> 54:58.046
Done?

54:59.047 --> 55:00.382
It's the gloves.

55:00.632 --> 55:02.592
- Take them off.
- Remove the sheet.

55:03.051 --> 55:04.302
We're starting.

55:05.887 --> 55:07.055
Geez. What a pain.

55:09.933 --> 55:12.560
You may begin. You have an hour.

55:17.607 --> 55:18.650
Sorry for your sis.

55:18.942 --> 55:21.236
No shit. I thought you hated her.

55:21.903 --> 55:23.238
It's still fucked.

55:23.488 --> 55:24.781
It's just a finger.

55:26.408 --> 55:27.409
Very nice.

55:28.243 --> 55:29.786
Look, get right in there.

55:29.911 --> 55:31.329
Dive in, don't be afraid.

55:31.830 --> 55:33.581
Tell her. She'll like that.

55:41.506 --> 55:45.260
<i>Rookies, we got lucky</i>

55:45.468 --> 55:49.097
<i>We're here, it's going to get yucky</i>

55:50.515 --> 55:53.685
<i>Watch out, rookie</i>

55:54.519 --> 55:57.647
<i>Don't refuse,
everyone must pay their dues</i>

55:57.772 --> 55:59.649
Sit!

56:02.485 --> 56:04.821
Stand!

56:05.822 --> 56:07.907
Sing!

56:07.991 --> 56:11.786
<i>Help me, help me, the rabbit said
Or the hunter will shoot me dead</i>

57:13.681 --> 57:15.225
Bring it down!

57:31.074 --> 57:32.534
Did you touch it?

57:32.617 --> 57:33.701
Did you?

57:38.540 --> 57:40.208
You're insane, man.

57:40.792 --> 57:42.293
Let's play, come on. Over here.

58:34.596 --> 58:38.433
<i>Seduction 101
Be a whore with decorum</i>

58:38.516 --> 58:41.603
<i>Laugh at boys
Ride with poise</i>

58:41.686 --> 58:46.441
<i>Blow job queen
Give him what he needs</i>

58:46.941 --> 58:49.694
<i>Citric acid, pheromones
Tick tick tick metronomes</i>

58:50.028 --> 58:52.155
<i>1 2 3 4 STOP!
We're done</i>

58:52.280 --> 58:55.533
<i>I'll treat you good
Hurt you good</i>

58:55.783 --> 58:58.953
<i>Oops goodbye
Ugly dicks with me don't fly</i>

58:59.037 --> 59:01.164
<i>Wedding night
I'll drown you in my pool</i>

59:01.497 --> 59:04.209
<i>Suck ya bones
Lap it up, honey</i>

59:04.292 --> 59:05.376
<i>Go work out</i>

59:05.460 --> 59:08.004
<i>Pretty corpse
I like to bang the dead</i>

59:08.213 --> 59:11.049
<i>Cold and hard
Talk less, 'tard</i>

59:13.635 --> 59:17.138
<i>I like to bang the dead
Bang the dead</i>

59:19.807 --> 59:23.144
<i>I like to bang the dead
Bang the dead</i>

59:23.394 --> 59:25.980
<i>Drugs yes please
Kitten I love you for the grams</i>

59:26.231 --> 59:28.650
<i>Dolly Titty
Nero so girly</i>

59:28.858 --> 59:30.735
<i>Taste the poison
Lucky charms</i>

59:30.818 --> 59:33.154
<i>Bang you pretty boy
My heart ain't dirty</i>

59:33.488 --> 59:36.532
<i>Fun in my sheets
Me + guys = zero</i>

59:36.658 --> 59:38.326
<i>Dom + straw = love me</i>

59:38.409 --> 59:41.412
<i>We don't do porn
But we like strap-ons</i>

59:41.496 --> 59:44.082
<i>I say tongue, you do clit
I say anthrax, you do cash</i>

59:44.374 --> 59:47.335
<i>I like coke in kilograms
Your friend can keep his kiss</i>

59:47.502 --> 59:49.671
<i>Working boy
Tombstone joy</i>

59:50.213 --> 59:53.341
<i>Lord of darkness in my heart
Bat tattoo</i>

59:53.633 --> 59:56.302
<i>Dance for me, oui oui
Chucky oui oui</i>

59:56.511 --> 59:59.013
<i>Fuck 69
Give me 666</i>

59:59.347 --> 1:00:00.515
<i>Hey</i>

1:00:02.684 --> 1:00:04.018
<i>Fuck 69</i>

1:00:21.369 --> 1:00:22.412
Bam! Done.

1:00:22.537 --> 1:00:24.706
You play 10 to 9, no wonder.

1:00:26.249 --> 1:00:28.001
Cute! Got my cocktail dress on.

1:00:28.084 --> 1:00:30.378
Off to get deflowered at your prom?

1:00:31.087 --> 1:00:32.171
I'm off.

1:00:32.380 --> 1:00:33.381
Where to?

1:00:33.673 --> 1:00:35.258
Hospital party. It's hardcore.

1:00:36.009 --> 1:00:39.554
They party on call
and barf if someone comes in.

1:00:39.679 --> 1:00:44.851
They treat the guy, then go back.
Luckily, you had nothing to sew back on.

1:00:44.934 --> 1:00:46.436
It'd be on backwards.

1:00:46.561 --> 1:00:48.104
- I'm so lucky.
- Later.

1:00:49.772 --> 1:00:50.898
Wanna beat me?

1:00:51.232 --> 1:00:52.608
Hands off.

1:00:53.276 --> 1:00:54.736
I thought he was gay.

1:00:56.195 --> 1:00:57.613
You want to play?

1:00:57.739 --> 1:00:58.906
Yeah.

1:01:04.203 --> 1:01:05.204
Did you lose weight?

1:01:05.288 --> 1:01:07.415
My dress fits you better. It's less slutty.

1:01:09.125 --> 1:01:10.209
Thank you.

1:01:11.044 --> 1:01:14.922
It's not a compliment.
You better not be anorexic. It's gross.

1:01:15.465 --> 1:01:16.507
I'm not sick.

1:01:16.591 --> 1:01:20.720
You will be if you keep it up.
I know what happens. You won't hold up.

1:01:20.803 --> 1:01:24.098
I'm not you. Do your thing. I don't need that.

1:01:24.265 --> 1:01:25.308
Really.

1:01:25.433 --> 1:01:27.643
No. I just tried it.

1:01:29.270 --> 1:01:32.565
You couldn't try something
other than my finger?

1:01:32.940 --> 1:01:35.276
Nothing else on the menu looked good?

1:01:38.279 --> 1:01:39.572
Was it good at least?

1:01:40.323 --> 1:01:41.783
You taste like curry.

1:01:43.409 --> 1:01:45.244
Throw the grenade!

1:01:46.621 --> 1:01:48.664
No, no, you missed it!

1:01:48.790 --> 1:01:50.416
Kill yourself, kill yourself.

1:02:21.864 --> 1:02:23.032
Alex?

1:02:58.693 --> 1:02:59.861
Stop!

1:03:01.821 --> 1:03:02.864
Alex!

1:04:21.984 --> 1:04:23.069
Thanks.

1:04:23.319 --> 1:04:24.737
Yeah, that one. The yellow one.

1:04:26.447 --> 1:04:28.115
Wait, forget it. This'll do.

1:04:28.324 --> 1:04:32.161
Let's go. Don't come out until you're green.

1:05:18.541 --> 1:05:20.501
It's OK, we'll go slow.

1:05:53.492 --> 1:05:55.870
- Fuck! What's wrong?
- She's fucking insane.

1:07:06.232 --> 1:07:07.316
Want a drag?

1:07:08.776 --> 1:07:09.944
Come here.

1:07:11.904 --> 1:07:13.322
Wait.

1:07:17.952 --> 1:07:19.286
Did he grab you?

1:07:19.662 --> 1:07:20.913
Yeah, but still.

1:07:21.288 --> 1:07:22.790
- He didn't force you.
- No.

1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:26.168
You like him?

1:07:26.961 --> 1:07:28.170
I don't know.

1:07:28.421 --> 1:07:29.505
He turns you on.

1:07:29.630 --> 1:07:31.132
I don't know.

1:07:31.590 --> 1:07:34.093
- You still turned on now?
- Why do you ask?

1:07:34.802 --> 1:07:36.971
To figure out how you work.

1:07:37.471 --> 1:07:38.848
How I work?

1:07:38.973 --> 1:07:41.475
If you like S&M shit, or worse.

1:07:44.437 --> 1:07:46.856
- Are you going to kiss me?
- No.

1:07:47.773 --> 1:07:49.442
So why stress out?

1:07:49.525 --> 1:07:50.818
I'm not.

1:07:53.154 --> 1:07:54.613
Should I be?

1:07:56.991 --> 1:07:59.827
OK. I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

1:08:44.163 --> 1:08:45.372
It's bad.

1:09:58.279 --> 1:09:59.780
Stop it.

1:10:06.287 --> 1:10:07.454
Stop it!

1:11:21.862 --> 1:11:24.198
Tell my sister
to look at her phone. Alex

1:11:27.868 --> 1:11:31.705
Mom says they put Quicky down.
She's so sad. LOL #waytoocute

1:11:35.834 --> 1:11:37.378
My sister has your number?

1:11:44.551 --> 1:11:46.387
Sure. Ignore me.

1:11:46.762 --> 1:11:49.056
Nice way to treat a girl after deflowering her.

1:11:49.181 --> 1:11:50.557
Makes me feel great.

1:11:51.767 --> 1:11:52.851
Screw your sister!

1:11:53.102 --> 1:11:54.311
It's not about my sister.

1:11:54.395 --> 1:11:56.105
Did something happen?

1:11:57.356 --> 1:12:01.610
I'm sorry. We...
I shouldn't have done that with you.

1:12:01.902 --> 1:12:05.072
What do you mean? Cut the crap.
It's my fault now?

1:12:05.781 --> 1:12:07.032
Oh, so, I'm too crazy?

1:12:07.908 --> 1:12:09.410
I'm gay. OK?

1:12:09.702 --> 1:12:11.328
If I spent 20 years hiding,

1:12:11.412 --> 1:12:13.414
it's not to fuck girls now, OK?

1:13:21.190 --> 1:13:23.192
Hey! Come here, come here.

1:13:23.317 --> 1:13:24.860
One shot, please.

1:13:25.486 --> 1:13:27.863
- I'm out of glasses, is that OK?
- A small one.

1:13:27.988 --> 1:13:29.656
- Yeah, sure.
- Here.

1:13:29.990 --> 1:13:34.661
More. More, more. More, more.
Save me the trip.

1:14:33.887 --> 1:14:36.431
Find someone else, bitch!

1:14:37.891 --> 1:14:39.935
What's her problem?

1:14:40.936 --> 1:14:42.729
What are you doing here?

1:14:43.355 --> 1:14:46.233
They're no fun. Let's split.

1:14:46.358 --> 1:14:49.695
Stick around. We're funny for sure.

1:14:49.778 --> 1:14:51.280
Oh yeah, for sure.

1:14:54.575 --> 1:14:55.742
Come on.

1:15:18.557 --> 1:15:19.725
Come on.

1:17:09.376 --> 1:17:11.003
Come here. We need to talk.

1:17:12.713 --> 1:17:13.880
What?

1:17:18.218 --> 1:17:19.761
Got something to say?

1:17:26.226 --> 1:17:27.602
What is it?

1:17:29.896 --> 1:17:31.231
<i>Go fetch!</i>

1:17:35.569 --> 1:17:36.778
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

1:17:40.866 --> 1:17:41.992
<i>She's so fucked up.</i>

1:17:42.075 --> 1:17:43.243
<i>Don't film it, come on!</i>

1:17:48.707 --> 1:17:50.917
<i>Hey! Bite.</i>

1:17:54.921 --> 1:17:56.340
<i>Go on.</i>

1:17:57.215 --> 1:17:58.925
<i>Bite him, Justine!</i>

1:18:10.354 --> 1:18:12.105
<i>This is fucked up, stop it.</i>

1:18:20.072 --> 1:18:21.406
Where were you?

1:18:21.615 --> 1:18:22.699
You let her do that?

1:18:22.783 --> 1:18:24.076
Wait. Stop, calm down.

1:18:24.284 --> 1:18:26.286
Move. Let me go.

1:18:26.411 --> 1:18:28.789
- Calm down now.
- Get out of my way!

1:18:29.122 --> 1:18:30.957
- Stop it, fuck.
- Fuck off.

1:18:34.378 --> 1:18:36.296
Fuck it, it's your life.

1:19:16.753 --> 1:19:17.963
You taste like shit.

1:19:22.759 --> 1:19:24.344
- Are you OK?
- Move.

1:21:20.460 --> 1:21:21.586
Hey.

1:21:27.592 --> 1:21:28.635
Yeah.

1:24:45.123 --> 1:24:47.083
Adrien! Adrien!

1:24:54.966 --> 1:24:56.176
Adrien!

1:24:57.927 --> 1:24:59.179
Adrien!

1:25:10.356 --> 1:25:12.484
Why didn't you fight back?

1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:21.284
Hit me!

1:25:22.702 --> 1:25:23.703
Hit me!

1:25:24.662 --> 1:25:26.664
You should have hit me.

1:30:20.083 --> 1:30:21.501
Finish your veggies.

1:30:22.460 --> 1:30:23.795
I'm full.

1:30:36.933 --> 1:30:39.352
Don't leave the table until you're done.

1:30:47.193 --> 1:30:49.195
Don't take it personally.

1:30:49.612 --> 1:30:50.863
I know.

1:30:55.201 --> 1:30:56.285
It's not your fault.

1:30:57.620 --> 1:30:58.788
I know, Dad.

1:31:06.003 --> 1:31:07.505
Or your sister's.

1:31:09.382 --> 1:31:10.550
What?

1:31:14.178 --> 1:31:16.806
When she was born,
she was our little princess.

1:31:17.181 --> 1:31:18.850
We took her everywhere.

1:31:19.725 --> 1:31:21.227
Our friends loved her.

1:31:21.477 --> 1:31:23.646
She was full tilt from the start.

1:31:23.896 --> 1:31:26.566
She should have studied politics
or something.

1:31:29.902 --> 1:31:32.572
So, I guess she got used to being...

1:31:33.739 --> 1:31:35.074
herself.

1:31:40.746 --> 1:31:43.082
It's our fault. We didn't find a solution.

1:31:44.917 --> 1:31:46.252
What do you mean?

1:31:53.759 --> 1:31:55.845
Your mom was tough at first.

1:31:56.846 --> 1:31:58.848
Kept saying I was her best friend at school.

1:31:58.931 --> 1:32:00.516
It drove me nuts.

1:32:02.602 --> 1:32:04.687
It's not like she had a boyfriend.

1:32:05.188 --> 1:32:06.230
Just me.

1:32:09.442 --> 1:32:11.903
And then we had our first kiss.

1:32:13.112 --> 1:32:14.447
And I understood.

1:32:40.097 --> 1:32:42.725
I'm sure you'll find a solution, honey.
