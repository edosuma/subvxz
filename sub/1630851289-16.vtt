All right, I'm all warmed up.

When Pop Pop gets here,
he's gonna have

00:26.360 --> 00:28.727
a front row couch seat
to a sneak preview

00:28.954 --> 00:29.936
of my newest rock opera.

00:30.013 --> 00:31.938
Or rock Pop-Pop-ra,
if you will.

00:32.091 --> 00:33.866
Actually, Pop Pop will be
too busy looking at

00:34.017 --> 00:36.351
all my newly acquired
vintage Burobu cards

00:36.370 --> 00:38.203
from their "Fairy Tales" series.

00:38.355 --> 00:41.064
Um, I think Pop Pop will be
pretty occupied with me

00:41.116 --> 00:43.042
because I'll be interviewing him
for school,

00:43.227 --> 00:45.602
which is the whole reason
he's coming over, so...

00:45.621 --> 00:47.954
Ugh. Why would he want to do
boring school stuff

00:48.049 --> 00:50.440
when he can hear about
the Burobu cards I have?

00:50.459 --> 00:52.534
And, more importantly,
about the ones I don't have

00:52.553 --> 00:54.795
but want and need
very, very badly.

00:54.963 --> 00:55.796
He'll get the hint.

00:55.964 --> 00:56.947
Sorry, but he'll be

00:57.040 --> 00:58.223
too mesmerized by my show.

00:58.375 --> 00:59.874
It's called
<i> The Gene-uine Article.</i>

00:59.968 --> 01:01.301
I'll be debuting
my glam-eridoo.

01:01.453 --> 01:04.563
It's like a didgeridoo,
but with more sizzle-sazzle.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.290
(blowing):
Glam-er...

01:06.308 --> 01:08.141
Look, I'm not against
vintage slug cards

01:08.235 --> 01:09.976
or the musical arts,
but I'm really gonna need

01:10.129 --> 01:11.737
all of Pop Pop's eyes and ears
on me.

01:11.964 --> 01:13.297
Or the ears he can
still hear out of.

01:13.465 --> 01:15.649
Tina's right. You two need
to give your sister a chance

01:15.725 --> 01:18.726
to do her report thingy on, uh,
what's it about again, hon?

01:18.746 --> 01:20.061
We have to interview
an older relative

01:20.081 --> 01:21.580
and ask them these questions.

01:21.731 --> 01:22.897
How many people have you killed?

01:22.991 --> 01:24.065
What? That's not on there,
is it?

01:24.159 --> 01:25.976
Aw, it's gonna be so sweet.

01:25.994 --> 01:27.311
You and your Grandpa Belcher

01:27.329 --> 01:29.313
chitchatting about
the good old days,

01:29.406 --> 01:31.573
eating these nice
cheese and crackers,

01:31.650 --> 01:32.758
writing stuff down.

01:32.909 --> 01:34.484
Yeah, it's-it's gonna be great.

01:34.578 --> 01:37.096
But, I mean, Tina, don't expect,
you know, too much from him

01:37.323 --> 01:40.324
'cause my dad's not the most,
um, chitchatty.

01:40.417 --> 01:42.542
If we get enough booze in him,
that bird will sing.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.919
Well, I think I've got some
pretty good interviewing moves.

01:45.013 --> 01:46.179
I open with an icebreaker like,

01:46.332 --> 01:48.014
"Hey, is that a new haircut?
I love it."

01:48.167 --> 01:49.349
Hopefully he has
a new haircut.

01:49.518 --> 01:51.092
And then I casually ask,
"What moment from your past

01:51.186 --> 01:52.169
most shaped you?"

01:52.187 --> 01:54.354
What moment most shaped him?
Huh.

01:54.506 --> 01:56.857
-I bet it's the tree thing.
-What tree thing?

01:56.933 --> 01:58.766
Is Pop Pop a tree?
I had my suspicions.

01:58.861 --> 02:01.511
No. A tree almost fell on him
when he was younger.

02:01.530 --> 02:04.181
That's why he doesn't like
the woods, I think.

02:04.274 --> 02:06.350
Also, I saw him yell
at a tree once.

02:06.443 --> 02:08.627
Um, spoiler.
Just let him tell it.

02:08.778 --> 02:10.370
-(phone rings)
-Hello?

02:10.522 --> 02:13.966
-Oh, hi, Big Bob.
You on your way?
-Ah, not yet.

02:14.117 --> 02:15.525
My walk-in's on the fritz,
and I got to pack

02:15.619 --> 02:17.210
all this food up
and put it on ice.

02:17.287 --> 02:18.804
And then I got to yell
at my walk-in,

02:19.031 --> 02:20.364
so I'm gonna be late
for dinner.

02:20.382 --> 02:22.199
Oh, okay. We'll see you
when you get here.

02:22.217 --> 02:24.534
-We can eat later,
like they do in Europe. Olé!
-Right.

02:24.628 --> 02:27.053
-Also, I'm gonna bring
a bunch of milk.
-He's bringing milk.

02:27.206 --> 02:29.222
-Dad, we don't need milk.
-Too late, he hung up.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.132
I'll just put the cheese tray
away till he gets here.

02:31.152 --> 02:33.894
-Don't you dare.
-Wait, I want to hear more about

02:34.046 --> 02:35.136
this tree-falling story.

02:35.230 --> 02:36.880
And why have<i> we</i> never
heard it?

02:36.973 --> 02:39.474
Is it super gruesome?
Was Grandpa's face mangled

02:39.568 --> 02:40.567
beyond recognition?

02:40.719 --> 02:42.068
Does he have a fake face?
Tell me.

02:42.163 --> 02:44.237
Or maybe let's just
respect the integrity

02:44.331 --> 02:45.980
of my interview
and not talk about it,

02:46.000 --> 02:47.666
and we all quietly wait
for Grandpa to get here?

02:47.893 --> 02:49.075
That's an idea.

02:49.228 --> 02:50.818
No, Louise, the tree
almost fell on him.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.396
I don't know much more
about it, though,

02:52.414 --> 02:55.174
'cause my dad's not
what you'd call communicative.

02:55.325 --> 02:56.991
Because he speaks
in the language of dance.

02:57.011 --> 02:58.159
I wonder what happened.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.678
Well, we'll find out
soon enough,

02:59.847 --> 03:01.087
so no need to keep...

03:01.182 --> 03:02.514
I bet it happened
way, way back

03:02.666 --> 03:03.907
in the old country.

03:03.926 --> 03:05.017
And you're still
talking about it.

03:05.168 --> 03:07.001
It was probably before cars

03:07.021 --> 03:09.429
<i> or computers or juice boxes,</i>

03:09.581 --> 03:11.765

03:15.087 --> 03:16.678
Yeah, but I would have known...

03:16.697 --> 03:17.938
Bob, shush. Sit down.

03:18.090 --> 03:19.589
I want to hear about when
Big Bob was a cop.

03:19.608 --> 03:21.258

03:21.351 --> 03:22.943
<i> LOUISE:</i>

03:25.264 --> 03:26.854

<i> this no-good giant was</i>

03:26.874 --> 03:28.615
<i> grinding up villagers' bones,</i>

<i> baking them into bread,</i>

<i> And the worst part?</i>
<i> The bread made people sick</i>

03:36.291 --> 03:38.366
<i> -with horrible, nonstop farts.</i>
-(flatulence)

03:38.385 --> 03:40.277
Wait, that's worse than
grinding up people's bones?

03:40.295 --> 03:42.446
Never mind, I'm not
encouraging this.

03:42.448 --> 03:44.205
<i> LOUISE:</i>
<i> Big Bob had been given</i>
<i> an anonymous tip</i>

03:44.225 --> 03:45.891

04:01.057 --> 04:02.890
-Aha.
-Uh-oh.

04:02.985 --> 04:04.726
-I see you.
-No, you don't.

04:04.803 --> 04:06.820
I do, because you're a giant.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.154
Well, fee, fi, fo, fum,

04:08.249 --> 04:11.566
you have a face,
and it is dumb, Big Bob.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.327
<i> LOUISE:</i>
<i> This wasn't the first time</i>
<i> Gramps had busted the giant.</i>

04:14.404 --> 04:16.313
<i> -He had nabbed him</i>

-(gasps)

04:16.331 --> 04:17.981
<i> -'Cause he lifted a shop.</i>
-Aw, come on.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.499
I got a bone to pick
with you, Giant.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.909
Or, rather, many bones
that you crushed

04:21.929 --> 04:24.004
and baked into bread
that made people sick

04:24.098 --> 04:25.931
with wild super-mega-farts.

04:26.082 --> 04:28.158
-(flatulence)
-VILLAGER: Why?!

04:28.251 --> 04:31.252
Okay, sure, maybe I used to
grind a few villagers' bones

04:31.421 --> 04:33.105
to make bread,
but I gave that all up.

04:33.332 --> 04:35.607
It was too messy
and, frankly, really hard to get

04:35.834 --> 04:37.943
those bones out of
all those little villagers.

04:38.094 --> 04:39.669
We'll see.
Some of your bread is

04:39.763 --> 04:40.687
being tested for villager bones

04:40.839 --> 04:41.947
at the crime lab
right now, so...

04:42.174 --> 04:43.507
-(phone vibrates)
-Ooh.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.783
It's the lab
conveniently calling me

04:45.010 --> 04:46.434
right at this moment.
Hold on.

<i> -with a really long cord.</i>
<i> -GENE: Got it.</i>

04:52.367 --> 04:54.776
Wait a minute, it's not
villager bones in the bread?

04:54.795 --> 04:56.611
It's beans?

04:56.705 --> 04:57.963
See? I'm innocent.

04:58.114 --> 05:00.373
-Told you you're dumb.
-Okay. Sorry, sorry.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.876
That's what the story
everyone knows got wrong.

05:03.028 --> 05:04.861
It wasn't the giant
who was the bad guy.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.713
It was the beanstalk.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.048
(Linda gasps)

05:08.142 --> 05:09.474
I was gonna say Mr. Bean.
So close.

05:09.626 --> 05:12.052
I mean, the giant did
grind up some villagers' bones

05:12.204 --> 05:14.037
at some point,
so kind of a bad guy.

05:14.130 --> 05:16.222
Also, beanstalks aren't trees,

05:16.375 --> 05:17.816
if that's where you're going
with all this.

05:18.043 --> 05:19.209
They're, uh, beanstalks.

05:19.302 --> 05:21.636
No, they're trees,
and this beanstalk was

05:21.655 --> 05:23.046
the worst tree of all.

05:23.065 --> 05:25.549
Okay, thanks. Bye.

05:25.567 --> 05:28.810
Hmm, it's as though
someone wanted it to seem like

05:28.829 --> 05:30.236
you were behind all this
to take the heat off

05:30.331 --> 05:32.313
of whoever's really pulling
the strings.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.315
So, if it's beans,
where are they coming from?

05:34.393 --> 05:37.227
Some kind of bean factory?
L.L. Bean?

05:37.229 --> 05:39.079
-What the...? Whoa, whoa.
-Huh? Aah!

05:39.231 --> 05:43.342
<i> LOUISE:</i>
<i>Suddenly, huge tendrils swoop up</i>
<i> and grab Pop Pop and the giant,</i>

05:43.493 --> 05:45.844
<i>and they find themselves trapped</i>
<i> in a crazy cage</i>

05:45.995 --> 05:47.179
<i> made of bean vines.</i>

05:47.330 --> 05:49.181
<i> The beanstalk even grew</i>
<i> a lock on itself,</i>

05:49.332 --> 05:50.998
<i> so they were totally</i>
<i> bean-carcerated.</i>

05:51.018 --> 05:53.352
BIG BOB:
Beanstalk!

05:53.579 --> 05:54.853
GIANT:
Wait, why are you so mad?

05:55.004 --> 05:57.147
This is so much more
uncomfortable for me!

06:01.195 --> 06:04.254
So a beanstalk held
my cop-dad prisoner?

06:04.347 --> 06:06.347
-And a giant.
-Again, I'd be totally fine

06:06.367 --> 06:08.091
holding off on
any story predictions

06:08.184 --> 06:09.517
until Grandpa actually
gets here.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.778
Tina, do you want to know
Grandpa's tree story or not?

06:11.872 --> 06:13.354
Not. I mean, not this one.

06:13.374 --> 06:15.707
Well, I'm sorry,
but that's the wrong answer.

06:15.859 --> 06:17.042
Now, where was I?
Oh, yeah.

06:17.193 --> 06:19.378
Pop Pop and the giant were
being held prisoner

06:19.571 --> 06:20.787
in a huge vine cage,

06:20.939 --> 06:23.048
guarded by the beanstalk's
henchmen.

06:23.125 --> 06:25.533
We're really doing
a good job guarding.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.718
-Agreed.
-Hey.

06:26.945 --> 06:28.294
Why does your boss like

06:28.447 --> 06:30.037
making people fart
so much anyway?

06:30.132 --> 06:31.890
None of your business,
but farts are up to

06:32.041 --> 06:33.450
30% carbon dioxide.

06:33.468 --> 06:36.152
And plants love carbon dioxide,
so you do the math.

06:36.154 --> 06:37.954
But also, none of your business.

06:37.973 --> 06:39.789
So what happens now?

06:39.808 --> 06:42.717
Mr. Stalk's probably gonna
turn you into fertilizer.

06:42.794 --> 06:43.810
-Ha!
-When he doesn't like you,

06:43.904 --> 06:45.311
he makes you into fertilizer.

06:45.464 --> 06:47.722
But when he does like you,
you get weekly presents.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.241
Mostly beans, but still.

06:49.468 --> 06:50.817
Giant, do you have anything
that could

06:50.969 --> 06:52.469
help us get out of here?

06:52.487 --> 06:54.246
O-Okay, I have this one thing
that looks like a toothpick

06:54.397 --> 06:57.416
made out of a villager's bone,
but it totally isn't.

06:57.643 --> 06:58.658
Ah, just pick the lock.

06:58.810 --> 07:00.085
We hear you whispering.

07:00.162 --> 07:01.995
Don't even think about
trying to sneak out of here.

07:02.147 --> 07:04.238
There's no way to esca--
Oh, they got out.

-(cheering)

08:15.162 --> 08:17.053
<i> The beanstalk and the henchmen</i>
<i> went to jail,</i>

08:20.167 --> 08:21.816
<i> Grandpa opened a restaurant.</i>
<i> The end.</i>

08:21.835 --> 08:25.078
Wow. Who would've thought
beanstalks were such mean trees?

08:25.230 --> 08:27.247
-The bastards.
-Louise, that was a...

08:27.399 --> 08:30.675
great guess of what
Grandpa's tree story could be.

08:30.827 --> 08:33.845
But I feel like that's
probably not what happened.

08:33.997 --> 08:36.163
-It is.
-Hmm.
-Well, I feel like I have

08:36.258 --> 08:38.091
a pretty great and
probably way more accurate idea

of what

08:40.762 --> 08:42.262
Ooh, it already sounds accurate!

08:42.356 --> 08:44.581
Or we can just talk
about something else?

08:44.599 --> 08:46.082
Like birds. Am I right?

08:46.175 --> 08:48.009
-It was a sunny day
in the forest.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.176
<i> Grandpa was looking</i>

09:00.023 --> 09:01.114
Huh. Not sure
what that's all about.

09:01.266 --> 09:02.541
<i> GENE:</i>
<i> Pop Pop was confused</i>

<i> to find</i>

09:05.954 --> 09:07.437
-Found it!
<i> -Grandpa set up his tent,</i>

09:07.606 --> 09:09.439
<i>got out some ice cream and soda</i>
<i> from his cooler,</i>

09:09.532 --> 09:11.657
<i> and made himself one heck</i>
<i> of an ice cream float.</i>

09:11.810 --> 09:13.777
<i> Which is something I assume</i>
<i> you do when you're camping.</i>

09:13.795 --> 09:15.779
<i> And then he also took out</i>
<i> his glam-eridoo.</i>

09:15.797 --> 09:18.965
<i> He was just about</i>
<i> to start playing when...</i>

09:19.059 --> 09:20.708
Wait, they had glam-eridoos
back then?

09:20.727 --> 09:21.801

09:21.953 --> 09:23.562
-I buy it.
-Thank you, Mother.

09:23.789 --> 09:24.971
So, there's Pop Pop.

09:25.123 --> 09:26.731
<i> He was just about</i>

-Aah!
<i> -A huge pine cone</i>
<i> fell right next to him.</i>

09:31.630 --> 09:33.479
<i> Grandpa was very startled,</i>

09:33.632 --> 09:35.481

<i> since it had the perfect</i>
<i> ice cream-to-soda ratio.</i>

(groans)
That camping float had

09:40.271 --> 09:42.322
the perfect

09:42.474 --> 09:45.083
<i> GENE:</i>
<i> Big Bob went over to pick up</i>

-Huh?
<i> -And when he looked through</i>

<i> -in black and white.</i>
<i> -(Linda gasps)</i>

09:52.426 --> 09:54.759
These are some strange
glittery binoculars.

09:54.911 --> 09:56.428
But what are you gonna do?

09:56.579 --> 09:58.838
<i> GENE: Grandpa looked around</i>
<i>at all the black-and-white trees</i>

09:58.932 --> 10:00.323
<i> and grass and stuff,</i>

10:00.416 --> 10:02.601
<i> but one tree</i>
<i> wasn't a tree at all.</i>

10:02.828 --> 10:05.011
<i> It was an alien monster!</i>

10:05.180 --> 10:06.996
-What the...?
-So, there's aliens?

10:07.015 --> 10:08.940
-Uh, yeah, there's aliens.
-Yeah, Dad,

10:09.167 --> 10:10.850
don't you ever look up
at the sky and wonder?

10:11.019 --> 10:12.444
Of course there's aliens, Bob.
Come on!

10:12.595 --> 10:15.688
It's just, I... can't believe
my dad never mentioned them.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.115
Anyway,

10:17.266 --> 10:18.842
<i> Grandpa can only see the alien</i>

10:18.935 --> 10:21.786
<i> when he's looking through</i>
<i> the sparkly binoculars.</i>

10:21.938 --> 10:23.104
I got one that can see.

10:23.181 --> 10:24.681
Yes, I'm sure.
I'm looking right at him.

10:24.699 --> 10:26.366
And he's looking at me
like, "I can see you."

10:26.460 --> 10:28.685
<i> GENE:</i>
<i> Then the alien disappears!</i>

10:28.778 --> 10:29.794
<i> Can you even imagine?</i>

10:30.021 --> 10:30.945
<i> LINDA:</i>
<i> Oh, my goodness.</i>

10:30.964 --> 10:32.947

10:32.966 --> 10:34.540
Not<i> one</i> bit.

10:34.693 --> 10:35.708
-Quick!
-(gasps)

10:35.861 --> 10:37.360
Follow me.
We don't have much time.

10:37.453 --> 10:39.304
-Uh, hold on.
<i> -GENE: Big Bob looks</i>
<i> at the camper</i>

10:39.455 --> 10:41.698
<i> through the binoculars to make</i>
<i> sure she's not an alien, too.</i>

10:41.716 --> 10:44.033
-Okay, you pretty much seem
like a human.
-Thank you.

10:44.127 --> 10:46.794
I designed these glittery
alien-seeing binoculars.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.980
I'm a really smart,
nature-loving scientist.

10:49.207 --> 10:50.315
I'm part of a small group
of campers

10:50.466 --> 10:52.133
who picked up
their alien signals.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.544
We've been studying them, trying
to learn their weaknesses.

10:54.562 --> 10:57.063
Oh! Did you make
that weird recording I heard

10:57.215 --> 10:58.715
when I first walked
into the forest?

10:58.808 --> 11:00.066
Yeah. Was it too cryptic?

11:00.218 --> 11:01.718
Like in a not helpful way?

11:01.811 --> 11:03.811
-Mm, kind of.
-Crap. Sorry.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.497
Aah! They're onto us!

11:05.648 --> 11:07.332
<i> GENE:</i>
<i> Grandpa and his new</i>
<i> camper buddy turned around</i>

11:07.559 --> 11:10.168
<i> and saw a bunch</i>
<i> of secret tree aliens</i>

11:10.319 --> 11:11.485
<i> coming towards them.</i>

11:11.579 --> 11:13.079
We should probably run
in the opposite direction

11:13.231 --> 11:14.839
-so we don't die.
-I'd love to not die.

11:14.991 --> 11:16.657
<i> GENE:</i>
<i> They ran for their lives,</i>

11:16.677 --> 11:19.235
<i> -with the tree aliens</i>
<i> close behind them.</i>
-(yelling)

11:19.254 --> 11:21.471
What is this, World War Tree?

11:25.577 --> 11:27.334
Okay, so Grandpa's being chased
by alien trees,

11:27.354 --> 11:30.747
and I'm 95% sure this is
what happened in his tree story.

11:30.765 --> 11:32.081
And now a little cheese break.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.416
-(chewing)
-Uh, Gene,

11:33.435 --> 11:35.752
your story sounds a lot
like the movie<i> They Live.</i>

11:35.845 --> 11:37.195
Have you seen that recently?

11:37.272 --> 11:39.013
You mean, when you were watching
it and you told me

11:39.107 --> 11:40.514
to go to bed but I might have
come out of my room

11:40.534 --> 11:42.108
and watched the rest of it
from the hallway?

11:42.260 --> 11:44.185
Someone's a Rowdy Roddy Peeper.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.686
Getting back to the story,

11:45.706 --> 11:48.689
<i> the aliens were gaining on</i>
<i> Grandpa and the scientist.</i>

11:48.783 --> 11:50.542
<i> Luckily, the aliens</i>
<i> were also major klutzes,</i>

11:50.693 --> 11:52.952
<i> falling all over the place,</i>
<i> 'cause it's hard to run</i>

<i> -when you're a tree.</i>

11:58.126 --> 12:00.443

-Aah!

12:00.536 --> 12:02.053
-(grunting)
<i>-GENE: The scientist and Big Bob</i>
<i> threw themselves</i>

12:02.280 --> 12:04.630
<i> into the ranger station</i>
<i> and bolted the door.</i>

12:04.783 --> 12:05.965
What the heck is going on?

12:06.134 --> 12:07.800
Look, Ranger Person,
we're in trouble.

12:07.953 --> 12:09.135
The whole world's in trouble.

12:09.287 --> 12:10.620
They're all around us
and we never knew!

12:10.638 --> 12:12.789
Oh, you mean those trees
that were chasing you?

12:12.882 --> 12:14.307
Look at them through these.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.068
TINA:
Holy moly, ravioli.

12:17.220 --> 12:18.628
My thoughts exactly.
But I was more like,

12:18.646 --> 12:19.904
"Holy moly, hot stromboli."

12:20.056 --> 12:21.464
What are those things?
What do they want?

12:21.557 --> 12:23.149
To keep us from camping
so they can suck up

12:23.301 --> 12:25.651
all the resources of the forest
for their own planet

12:25.804 --> 12:27.228
without human intervention.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.472
-(groans) That's so annoying.
-Well, how do we stop them?

12:29.491 --> 12:31.732
They're controlling what we see
using some kind of signal.

12:31.826 --> 12:33.159
We have to find the source

12:33.311 --> 12:34.978
that's transmitting their signal
and destroy it.

12:34.996 --> 12:36.237
Do you know where
their signal is coming from?

12:36.331 --> 12:37.981
We haven't
fully figured it out yet,

12:37.999 --> 12:39.740
but we're getting close.

12:39.760 --> 12:40.817
Yeah. Too close.

12:40.877 --> 12:42.318
What? You're working for them?

12:42.411 --> 12:43.928
Also, that's just a stick.

12:44.155 --> 12:45.838
-No, it's a gun.
-Pretty sure it's a stick.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.173
Don't interfere. You can't win.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.674
But why are you siding
with them?

12:48.827 --> 12:50.084
They want to destroy the planet.

12:50.178 --> 12:51.661
Because they promised me
a sweet ranger gig

12:51.679 --> 12:53.663
in their space forest
that I couldn't pass up.

12:53.756 --> 12:55.106
Amazing benefits,
and I like the hat.

12:55.258 --> 12:56.757
It's a better hat than this hat.

12:56.926 --> 12:58.351
Now hands up. Come on!

12:58.503 --> 13:01.170
Sorry, i-it's hard to be
intimidated by your stick.

13:01.189 --> 13:03.356
If you used the binoculars,
you'd see it was a gun.

13:03.508 --> 13:05.283
But keep your hands up. You're
just gonna have to trust me.

13:05.527 --> 13:07.677

earlier. Uh, anyway, move it.

14:31.020 --> 14:32.762
We're free to camp again!

14:32.855 --> 14:35.264
Yep. I'm gonna go set up my tent
and have an ice cream float.

14:35.433 --> 14:37.691
-Okay. Nice meeting you.
-You, too. Bye-bye.

14:37.785 --> 14:40.269
And that's exactly what happened
to our dear grand-papa

14:40.363 --> 14:41.862
when the tree
almost fell on him.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.122
Actually, it was many trees.

14:43.274 --> 14:45.532
And they were aliens.
Clumsy aliens.

14:45.627 --> 14:46.959
Aw, Big Bob saved camping.

14:47.128 --> 14:48.444
-Like Ernest.
-Yep.

14:48.537 --> 14:50.613
I mean, he hates camping.
In real life.

14:50.632 --> 14:52.465
But I don't know why
I'm bringing that up.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.375
-Gre-Great story.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, great story.

14:54.469 --> 14:56.636
Hey, what if we all put tape
over our mouths

14:56.730 --> 14:58.712
until Grandpa gets here?
That could be fun.

14:58.732 --> 14:59.972
Right, right. Sorry, honey.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.215
Let's all respect Tina's wishes

15:01.234 --> 15:02.883
and just wait for Grandpa
to get here

15:02.977 --> 15:04.460
and tell the real story.

15:04.479 --> 15:05.052
Yes. Thank you.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.479
-But...
-Oh, no.

15:06.648 --> 15:09.815
Maybe what happened was that
the tree that almost hit Big Bob

15:09.968 --> 15:11.075
knew him personally.

15:11.302 --> 15:12.135
Yep, yep. Great.

15:12.228 --> 15:13.486
And the tree got annoyed
with him,

15:13.638 --> 15:14.913
and that's why it wanted
to crush him.

15:15.140 --> 15:17.640
I mean,
I could actually maybe see that.

15:17.733 --> 15:18.917
Well, not really. A little.

15:19.144 --> 15:20.567
Yeah! Maybe Big Bob would go

15:20.662 --> 15:22.069
<i> to this particular tree</i>
<i> every day</i>

15:22.163 --> 15:23.829
<i> and he'd ask for stuff</i>
<i> like apples</i>

15:23.924 --> 15:25.648
<i> and branches for firewood</i>

15:25.667 --> 15:27.926
<i> and leaves to make himself</i>
<i> weird, funky leaf belts.</i>

15:28.094 --> 15:29.502
<i> At first, the tree was like...</i>

15:29.578 --> 15:31.504
Hey, we're friends.
I love helping you out.

15:31.656 --> 15:33.172
How you like them apples?

15:33.266 --> 15:35.582
<i>But then the tree started to get</i>
<i> really, really annoyed by this.</i>

15:35.602 --> 15:38.678
You know, I'm starting to get
really, really annoyed by this.

15:38.830 --> 15:40.680
What do I ever get? Giving Tree?

15:40.774 --> 15:42.014
More like
Give Me a Break Tree.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.167
<i> So this time</i>
<i> when Big Bob came by,</i>

15:44.169 --> 15:46.260
<i> the tree had something else</i>
<i> planned.</i>

15:46.279 --> 15:47.779
Hey, uh, I'm gonna take
this knife and carve

15:47.930 --> 15:50.523
my Wi-Fi password into you so
I don't forget it. Hold still.

15:50.675 --> 15:53.009
Oh, hey, pal.
I got a question for you.

15:53.027 --> 15:55.602
If a tree falls on your head,
do you hear it?

15:55.622 --> 15:56.603
Huh? I don't know.

15:56.698 --> 15:57.713
Yeah, that's what I thought.

15:57.773 --> 15:59.624
Let's find out...!

15:59.775 --> 16:01.108
<i> -BIG BOB: Hi.</i>
-(yelping)

16:01.277 --> 16:02.609
-Grandpa!
-Grandpa!
-Grand-papa!

16:02.629 --> 16:04.945
Sorry. Y-You guys seem startled
to see me.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.355
You told me to come, right?

16:06.407 --> 16:08.024
It's just--
Did you let yourself in?

16:08.193 --> 16:09.208
Yeah. The door was unlocked.

16:09.360 --> 16:10.802
I thought
you left it open for me.

16:10.971 --> 16:13.529
I guess one of us left it open
for... anyone.

16:13.548 --> 16:14.806
And we got you!

16:14.975 --> 16:16.957
Oh, uh, here's four gallons
of milk from my walk-in.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.810
-It expires tomorrow.
-Milk party!

16:19.037 --> 16:20.536
So I guess... let's eat?

16:20.629 --> 16:21.871
-Yes! Finally.
-Yay!

16:21.889 --> 16:23.314
-No! No eating! Not yet!
-Whoa.

16:23.541 --> 16:26.058
Sorry, sorry. Just-- I really
need to interview Grandpa.

16:26.135 --> 16:27.893
-(breathing heavily)
-Uh, yeah, sure.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.803
-Let's do it.
-All right.

16:29.897 --> 16:31.547
Uh, I'll go...

16:31.640 --> 16:32.882
keep dinner kinda...

16:32.900 --> 16:33.899
warm-ish.

16:34.052 --> 16:35.384
Okay, first question.

16:35.478 --> 16:37.220
Uh, this one's got
a lot of buzz around it.

16:37.313 --> 16:40.573
What was the moment in your life
that most shaped you?

16:40.725 --> 16:42.166
Oh, uh... Hmm.

16:42.318 --> 16:44.393
I guess that'd be
when I went camping

16:44.412 --> 16:46.896
-and a tree almost fell on me.
-Oh, wow.

16:46.914 --> 16:48.414
A tree almost fell on you?

16:48.566 --> 16:49.656
I had no idea.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.083
So, tell me about that.

16:51.236 --> 16:52.826
I mean, yeah,
that's, uh, pretty much it.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.178
There you go. Yep.

16:54.330 --> 16:56.072
-What? What's that supposed
to mean?
-Hmm?

16:56.165 --> 16:58.424
Oh, nothing. I kind of expected
you to tell that story

16:58.576 --> 17:01.077
and for it to be
exactly that long.

17:01.170 --> 17:02.411
What? A tree almost fell on me.

17:02.430 --> 17:04.188
It didn't.
What more am I supposed to say?

17:04.415 --> 17:06.415
-Nothing. Forget it.
-No, no.
What are you getting at?

17:06.509 --> 17:09.268
Um, I'm kinda the one asking
the questions here, but okay.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.937
I'm just saying
you don't always communicate.

17:12.090 --> 17:13.013
Much of anything.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.849
Oh, Sorry I'm not
a Mr. Talks-A-Lot.

17:15.869 --> 17:16.942
No, it's fine. We get it.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.444
You don't like talking.
To people. At all.

17:18.596 --> 17:20.538
Wow. I'm so glad I came
over here to get yelled at.

17:20.765 --> 17:22.856
Well, you got your story out
in under two sentences

17:22.876 --> 17:25.025
-like you always do. So
you shouldn't hit any traffic...
-I left a walk-in in disrepair.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.211
-(arguing continues)
-Too late now,
but I guess this interview

17:27.363 --> 17:28.546
could've just been
a phone call?

17:28.773 --> 17:30.006
-LOUISE: Yeah.
-Yep.

17:34.128 --> 17:35.536
Well, uh,
maybe I'll just be going then.

17:35.630 --> 17:38.281
-Fine. Sure.
-Okay, the pasta's
keeping warm in there,

17:38.299 --> 17:42.042
which is kinda the opposite
of what's going on in here

17:42.062 --> 17:45.045
with the, uh,
ice-cold staring going on,

17:45.065 --> 17:46.547
-Bob.
-(grumbles)

17:46.566 --> 17:48.048
Dad, hush. Grandpa, sit.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.734
This is my interview.
I'm being graded on it.

17:49.885 --> 17:52.070
You came all this way.
Now, please, can we continue?

17:52.221 --> 17:53.963
-Ah. Sorry.
-Sorry, Tina.

17:54.056 --> 17:56.741
(quietly): I'm gonna move slowly
towards the cheese. Cover me.

17:56.892 --> 17:58.134
-No.
-That's fair.

17:58.152 --> 17:59.635
Now, Pop Pop, the tree
incident-- tell me more.

17:59.654 --> 18:02.138
I'm interested in: when
it happened, where it happened,

18:02.231 --> 18:03.915
why it happened,
who it happened to--

18:04.066 --> 18:06.567
no, I know that part--
and how did it shape you?

18:06.586 --> 18:09.069
Uh, I was... in my 20s.

18:09.163 --> 18:10.813
We were camping in a park--

18:10.832 --> 18:12.739
I forget the name--
near some trees,

18:12.834 --> 18:14.333
-obviously.
<i> -Uh-huh.</i>

18:14.485 --> 18:16.335
<i> BIG BOB:</i>
<i> It was night. It was raining.</i>

18:16.487 --> 18:19.004
<i> We were in the tent. And then</i>
<i> your grandmother went to go</i>

18:19.157 --> 18:20.247
<i> to the bathroom</i>
<i> 'cause the sound of the rain</i>

18:20.341 --> 18:22.600
<i> on the tent</i>
<i> made her need to go pee.</i>

18:22.751 --> 18:24.160
<i> GENE:</i>
<i> Just hearing you say that</i>
<i> makes me need to pee.</i>

18:24.253 --> 18:26.420
<i> Take a quick break?</i>
<i> Tina's face says no.</i>

18:26.439 --> 18:28.848
Wait, Mom was there? You-you
never mentioned that before.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.090
I didn't? Oh.

18:30.168 --> 18:31.758
Well, yeah. She was there.

18:31.778 --> 18:32.777
It was before we were married.

18:32.928 --> 18:35.171
Aw, camping in sin. So romantic.

18:35.264 --> 18:37.281
Okay, so our grandma was there.
But she went to the bathroom.

18:37.433 --> 18:39.600
-Then what happened?
-I guess the winds
were picking up

18:39.619 --> 18:42.769
<i> and I heard a crack and, all</i>
<i>of a sudden, the tent collapsed</i>

18:42.864 --> 18:44.771
<i> -and I didn't know</i>
<i> what was going on.</i>
<i> -Wow, scary.</i>

18:44.791 --> 18:48.275
<i> BIG BOB:</i>
<i> And it turned out,</i>
<i> a big tree fell on the tent.</i>

18:48.294 --> 18:50.369
<i> It just missed me,</i>
<i> and thank God your grandmother</i>

18:50.521 --> 18:53.113
<i> was in the bathroom, or else</i>
<i> she would've been crushed.</i>

18:53.133 --> 18:55.782
-That bathroom's a hero.
-What can't bathrooms do?

18:55.802 --> 18:57.376
And the way we treat them...

18:57.528 --> 19:00.287
Wow. So tell me why you think
this moment shaped who you are.

19:00.381 --> 19:02.807
Well, I'm not dead,
so that's one thing.

19:03.034 --> 19:04.216
Uh-huh. How else?

19:04.310 --> 19:05.885
I mean, he would've been shaped
like a pancake,

19:05.979 --> 19:07.203
but instead
he's shaped like that.

19:07.296 --> 19:09.205
-Thank you, Gene.
-I guess it made me

19:09.298 --> 19:12.558
think about your grandmother
and, kinda, life

19:12.710 --> 19:14.509
-in a different way.
-Uh-huh.

19:14.562 --> 19:17.822
<i> BIG BOB:</i>
<i> I remember seeing her face</i>
<i>after I crawled out of the tent.</i>

19:18.049 --> 19:19.640
<i> Or what was left of the tent.</i>

19:19.734 --> 19:22.067
<i> And I, uh, thought</i>
<i>about how much she meant to me.</i>

19:22.236 --> 19:24.311
<i> And, uh, I think</i>
<i> it was kind of in that moment</i>

19:24.330 --> 19:28.148
<i> that I realized I wanted</i>
<i> to ask her to marry me.</i>

19:28.168 --> 19:30.059
And, six years later,
I popped the question.

19:30.077 --> 19:31.727
Aw! What did she say?

19:31.746 --> 19:33.504
Uh, yes. She said yes.

19:33.731 --> 19:34.655
-Nice.
-BOB: I,

19:34.674 --> 19:36.232
uh, never knew any of that.

19:36.325 --> 19:38.234
That's such a beautiful story,
Big Bob.

19:38.252 --> 19:40.419
I mean,
my story had a giant in it.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.179
Just sayin'.

19:41.406 --> 19:42.513
You're a good interviewer.

19:42.740 --> 19:43.848
I feel like a blabbermouth.

19:43.999 --> 19:45.424
Yeah, Tina. R-Really good.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.909
Thank you. Thank you.

19:46.928 --> 19:48.093
Can't read my notes very well,

19:48.246 --> 19:49.929
but I'm sure I'll...
figure it out.

19:50.005 --> 19:52.598
Did you say you died
or didn't die?

19:52.750 --> 19:54.525
Aw! I'm so proud of my Tina.

19:54.677 --> 19:56.268
Asking Qs and kicking "A."

19:56.421 --> 19:57.920
Okay, let's eat
some mostly warm pasta.

19:58.013 --> 19:59.197
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

19:59.348 --> 20:00.923
Just a few more questions first.
Then we can...

20:01.016 --> 20:02.533
-No!
-No!
-Over dinner, over dinner.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.109
<i> BOB:</i>
<i> So, I, uh...</i>

20:04.278 --> 20:06.779
I can't believe I never knew
the whole tree story.

20:06.931 --> 20:08.372
About, you know, Mom and stuff.

20:08.599 --> 20:10.099
I guess I could be
a little better

20:10.192 --> 20:11.934
at, uh, sharing those things.

20:12.103 --> 20:14.453
Also, uh, maybe I didn't want
to bring Mom up

20:14.605 --> 20:17.289
and make you think about her
and... make you sad.

20:17.442 --> 20:19.700
It wouldn't have.
I mean, maybe a little.

20:19.794 --> 20:23.279
But in a good way. 'Cause
we'd be talking about her.

20:23.297 --> 20:27.116
And I could be a little better
at asking you things.

20:27.134 --> 20:29.227
Is there anything else
I should ask about?

20:29.454 --> 20:31.120
Did I ever tell you
about my other family?

20:31.138 --> 20:33.046
-What?
-I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.047
I think you know
all the good stuff.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.307
And you know about the walk-in,

20:35.401 --> 20:37.068
so that, uh,
brings you up to speed.

20:37.219 --> 20:38.719
LOUISE:
Hey, Pop Pop! Not to be rude,

20:38.738 --> 20:41.814
but there's a pretty impressive
Burobu card display out here,

20:41.966 --> 20:43.241
just waiting for your eyes!

20:43.392 --> 20:45.726
Oh, and there's a five-dollar
admission. Just FYI.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.395
GENE:
And my rock Pop-Pop-ra
isn't gonna watch itself!

20:48.473 --> 20:51.415
Also, the running time
is about an hour, so strap in!

20:51.567 --> 20:52.917
It might actually be
a little longer.
