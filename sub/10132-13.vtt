15:37.729 --> 15:40.147
Come on, guys. We've got

15:37.729 --> 15:40.147
a strategy meeting to go to.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.776
You can put the stray cow

15:40.189 --> 15:42.776
back in her barn.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.903
Uh, Mr. Malatesta, there's

15:42.817 --> 15:44.903
something you should know.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.987
Uh, this is not a stray cow.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.200
Joey and I have a baby.

15:53.578 --> 15:56.414
Hey, your personal lives

15:53.578 --> 15:56.414
are none of my business.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.044
Dagnab it.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.800
Alright, Joseph,

16:04.547 --> 16:06.800
a toast to our new careers.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.511
Um, urgh!

16:12.263 --> 16:15.433
Urgh, this is the last time

16:12.263 --> 16:15.433
I buy champagne in a can.

16:18.686 --> 16:19.979
Oh, you're back.

16:20.020 --> 16:23.274
You guys missed

16:20.020 --> 16:23.274
a major banner Tanner day.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.984
I'd like to present

16:23.316 --> 16:24.984
San Francisco's

16:25.025 --> 16:28.613
newest green belt, our own

16:25.025 --> 16:28.613
karate kid, D.J. Tanner.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.825
[applauding]

16:31.866 --> 16:33.534
Show them some moves.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.369
- Dad.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.369
- Come on, Deej.

16:35.411 --> 16:37.079
I spent a fortune

16:35.411 --> 16:37.079
on karate lessons.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.123
Give them a little, hiya!

16:39.165 --> 16:40.333
Hiya.

16:41.459 --> 16:43.294
Well, with no further ado

16:43.336 --> 16:46.213
the winner of the

16:43.336 --> 16:46.213
"Golden Hive Award" for Talent

16:46.255 --> 16:48.967
the queen bee

16:46.255 --> 16:48.967
of rock and roll.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.010
[applauding]

16:52.929 --> 16:56.265
Thank you, boys. I'm gonna buy

16:52.929 --> 16:56.265
everyone of you a Cadillac.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.769
Ah, Steph,

16:57.391 --> 16:59.769
you look great.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.145
How did you do?

17:01.187 --> 17:04.649
I was a hunk,

17:01.187 --> 17:04.649
a hunk of burning love. Hiya!

17:05.942 --> 17:07.944
We're very sorry

17:05.942 --> 17:07.944
we missed you girls today.

17:07.986 --> 17:10.363
That's alright. I explained

17:07.986 --> 17:10.363
you had to work late again.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.573
But good news.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.573
I got it all on tape.

17:12.615 --> 17:16.410
Great. Well, Joseph and I have

17:12.615 --> 17:16.410
a piece of good news ourselves.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.663
We landed a full-time job today.

17:18.705 --> 17:21.165
That's great!

17:18.705 --> 17:21.165
Way to go.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.961
- Aren't you girls happy for us?

17:22.667 --> 17:24.961
- Yeah, come on, girls.

17:25.003 --> 17:27.630
Where's our hug? This family

17:25.003 --> 17:27.630
hugs when the mail comes.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.884
How can you guys do this?

17:32.343 --> 17:34.595
Yeah, what's gonna

17:32.343 --> 17:34.595
happen to us?

17:34.637 --> 17:36.138
We're gonna be all alone.

17:38.725 --> 17:39.809
Girls..

17:41.394 --> 17:44.397
...you know you're always

17:41.394 --> 17:44.397
gonna be taken care of.

17:44.438 --> 17:47.817
This job is a big chance

17:44.438 --> 17:47.817
for Joey and Uncle Jesse.

17:47.859 --> 17:50.528
Think of all the wonderful

17:47.859 --> 17:50.528
things they've done for you.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.530
'And not because they had to'

17:52.572 --> 17:55.241
but just because they love you.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.035
We're not gonna

17:55.282 --> 17:57.035
leave you, girls.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.579
We'll still see you every

17:57.076 --> 17:59.579
morning before school.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.539
That's right.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.539
And everyday after work.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.999
And every weekend.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.458
All federal holidays.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.712
But it won't be the same.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.380
You guys missed today.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.090
You missed everything yesterday.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.219
Now, you're gonna miss

18:12.633 --> 18:15.219
the whole rest of our lives.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.805
And we'd miss you..

18:18.598 --> 18:20.058
...so much.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.360
Alright, maybe there were

18:29.149 --> 18:31.360
a few things we didn't consider

18:31.402 --> 18:33.404
when we took this job, Joseph.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.864
Alright, Jess.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.991
Red checkers are reasons

18:34.906 --> 18:36.991
to keep the job.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.077
Black checkers

18:37.033 --> 18:39.077
are reasons to quit.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.161
Alright, one major black checker

18:39.118 --> 18:41.161
is that we get a lot

18:41.203 --> 18:43.790
of great things

18:41.203 --> 18:43.790
out of raising these kids.

18:43.831 --> 18:47.418
I never thought I'd say this

18:43.831 --> 18:47.418
before but I dig being Mr. Mom.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.962
Never thought I'd say this

18:47.460 --> 18:48.962
but I think

18:49.003 --> 18:50.504
you look smashing

18:49.003 --> 18:50.504
in an apron.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.172
Dah!

18:52.214 --> 18:53.466
Alright.

18:53.507 --> 18:54.717
Missing the girls is one

18:54.759 --> 18:56.970
good reason not to keep the job.

18:57.011 --> 19:00.098
On the other hand, the job pays

18:57.011 --> 19:00.098
more money than we've ever seen

19:00.139 --> 19:02.600
in our lives

19:00.139 --> 19:02.600
and that is a major red checker.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.560
Right and we wouldn't

19:02.642 --> 19:04.560
just be writing jingles anymore.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.353
We're coming up with whole

19:04.602 --> 19:06.353
commercial campaigns.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.939
I mean that's a big step up.

19:07.981 --> 19:10.441
Plus, we like what we do.

19:07.981 --> 19:10.441
Alright, red checker.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.986
And it did feel great

19:10.483 --> 19:12.986
sitting in that big office.

19:13.027 --> 19:15.113
- Being out in the real world.

19:13.027 --> 19:15.113
- Yeah.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.239
- King me.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.239
- You got it.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.200
Well, it looks like

19:18.407 --> 19:20.200
we're going to work.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.120
I guess so.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.959
Joseph, there's one thing

19:26.165 --> 19:27.959
I'm forgetting.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.086
- Mm.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.086
- My music.

19:30.128 --> 19:32.254
I mean, if we took this job,

19:30.128 --> 19:32.254
there wouldn't be any time

19:32.296 --> 19:34.465
to write or play gigs.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.509
That's a major part

19:34.507 --> 19:36.509
of my life.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.427
Stack a black.

19:38.469 --> 19:41.514
And, hey, I'd have no time

19:38.469 --> 19:41.514
to work on my comedy.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.516
I mean, what good

19:41.555 --> 19:43.516
would Bullwinkle's voice be

19:43.557 --> 19:44.809
at the office?

19:46.226 --> 19:48.104
Black checker.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.773
Alright, Joseph,

19:48.146 --> 19:50.773
really think about this.

19:50.815 --> 19:54.027
Now, are we, are we ready

19:50.815 --> 19:54.027
to give up our dreams for this?

19:54.068 --> 19:56.195
- I don't want to.

19:54.068 --> 19:56.195
- Neither do I.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.031
But you have to admit

19:58.072 --> 20:00.658
we've had more success in the

19:58.072 --> 20:00.658
last three months of advertising

20:00.700 --> 20:03.077
than of all those years

20:00.700 --> 20:03.077
in music and comedy.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.746
- Red checker.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.333
Oh, boy.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.879
You know, Jess,

20:09.375 --> 20:12.879
life is like a salad bar.

20:13.838 --> 20:15.882
You have all these great choices

20:15.923 --> 20:18.258
but you can't help

20:15.923 --> 20:18.258
but think to yourself

20:18.300 --> 20:21.179
how often are they

20:18.300 --> 20:21.179
changing those beets?

20:27.727 --> 20:28.811
Hi, guys.

20:28.853 --> 20:29.979
(together)

20:28.853 --> 20:29.979
Hi.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.356
Somebody wants to say goodnight.

20:32.398 --> 20:36.069
- Say, goodnight, Joey.

20:32.398 --> 20:36.069
- Goodnight, Joey.

20:36.110 --> 20:39.155
Night-night, Michelle.

20:36.110 --> 20:39.155
Oh, I love you, Michelle.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.323
Black checker.

20:41.365 --> 20:44.618
- Say, night-night, Jesse.

20:41.365 --> 20:44.618
- Night-night, Jesse.

20:44.660 --> 20:48.081
Mwah. Night, Michelle. Oh!

20:50.041 --> 20:52.459
Guys, I swear I didn't do this

20:50.041 --> 20:52.459
to make you feel guilty.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.128
She really wanted

20:52.501 --> 20:54.128
to say goodnight.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.295
Hm, goodnight.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.256
- Goodnight.

20:57.297 --> 20:58.507
Oh, boy!

20:58.549 --> 21:00.634
[instrumental music]

21:03.637 --> 21:05.181
Hey, boys, wanna see me

21:03.637 --> 21:05.181
about something?

21:05.223 --> 21:06.473
Yes, sir.

21:06.515 --> 21:07.600
Uh, sir, Jesse and I

21:07.641 --> 21:09.727
are having some second thoughts.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.479
- Oh!

21:09.769 --> 21:12.479
- Let me ask you something, sir.

21:12.521 --> 21:16.025
Our job is to sit down and come

21:12.521 --> 21:16.025
up with brilliant ideas, right?

21:16.067 --> 21:18.402
So it wouldn't really matter

21:16.067 --> 21:18.402
where we're sitting

21:18.444 --> 21:20.320
when we come up with these

21:18.444 --> 21:20.320
brilliant ideas, right?

21:21.363 --> 21:23.282
Is this a trick question?

21:23.323 --> 21:24.533
No, no, no.

21:24.575 --> 21:26.244
The point is that..

21:26.285 --> 21:28.704
...it doesn't really matter

21:26.285 --> 21:28.704
where we're sitting, it..

21:28.746 --> 21:31.874
Okay, yeah, it was

21:28.746 --> 21:31.874
a trick question. Joey.

21:31.916 --> 21:33.793
You see, sir, it would

21:31.916 --> 21:33.793
solve a lot of our problems

21:33.834 --> 21:35.419
if we could work at home.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.088
- Work at home?

21:35.461 --> 21:37.088
- Yes.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.548
Um, Jesse and I have some dreams

21:39.590 --> 21:41.383
that we're not ready

21:39.590 --> 21:41.383
to give up yet.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.761
That's right. We have these kids

21:41.425 --> 21:43.761
that we'd really miss.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.888
Alright, the stray cow.

21:47.473 --> 21:51.769
I suppose I could hire you

21:47.473 --> 21:51.769
on a project-by-project basis.

21:51.811 --> 21:55.064
It's a little unusual but if

21:51.811 --> 21:55.064
working at home makes you happy.

21:56.356 --> 21:58.525
Although it would be

21:56.356 --> 21:58.525
inconvenient for me.

22:00.194 --> 22:03.864
I guess it'd be best

22:00.194 --> 22:03.864
for everyone concerned if..

22:03.906 --> 22:05.574
...you guys got out of here.

22:07.367 --> 22:08.828
To go home and go to work.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.454
I love you guys.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.454
It's a deal.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.873
[laughing]

22:12.915 --> 22:14.625
I got you.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.294
You should see your faces.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.629
[laughing]

22:18.671 --> 22:20.881
Surprise!

22:20.923 --> 22:23.843
Uh, Mr. Malatesta,

22:20.923 --> 22:23.843
these are our kids.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.552
- And this is Danny--

22:23.884 --> 22:25.552
- Uh-uh!

22:25.594 --> 22:29.515
Remember, your personal lives

22:25.594 --> 22:29.515
are none of my business.

22:32.810 --> 22:35.271
[laughing]

22:32.810 --> 22:35.271
We brought you some plants

22:32.810 --> 22:35.271
for your new office.

22:35.313 --> 22:37.857
Alright, everybody, pack them

22:35.313 --> 22:37.857
in the car and take them home

22:37.898 --> 22:39.859
because that's where

22:37.898 --> 22:39.859
we're working from now on.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.528
- Alright.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.528
- Yay!

22:42.569 --> 22:44.780
Oh, did you guys

22:42.569 --> 22:44.780
quit your jobs for us?

22:44.822 --> 22:46.115
Well, no, we didn't quit.

22:46.157 --> 22:47.449
We just arranged it

22:46.157 --> 22:47.449
so we could work at home.

22:47.491 --> 22:50.661
Daddy, can you do

22:47.491 --> 22:50.661
your TV show at home?

22:50.703 --> 22:54.957
No, honey. All those crew people

22:50.703 --> 22:54.957
would scuff up our floors.

22:54.999 --> 22:58.169
Unfortunately, most parents'

22:54.999 --> 22:58.169
jobs aren't that flexible.

22:58.211 --> 23:00.129
Hey, before we go home,

22:58.211 --> 23:00.129
you gotta check out this view.

23:00.171 --> 23:01.714
- Oh, yeah, come here.

23:00.171 --> 23:01.714
- Come on.
