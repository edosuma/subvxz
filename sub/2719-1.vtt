WEBVTT

00:00.452 --> 00:02.489
I do have an obligation
to this company,

00:02.621 --> 00:04.692
and I prove that every
day that I am here,

00:04.823 --> 00:06.928
but I also have an obligation
to my family, Jack,

00:07.059 --> 00:07.730
and I'm not gonna
let anything

00:08.026 --> 00:09.801
interfere
with that.

00:09.928 --> 00:12.636
Including
this job.

00:12.764 --> 00:14.209
You walk out that
door, Bill,

00:14.333 --> 00:15.641
and it is over
for you.

00:15.767 --> 00:18.941
Everything you have
ever worked for.

00:23.141 --> 00:25.781
And what is that
everything, Jack?

00:25.911 --> 00:26.889
Hm?

00:27.012 --> 00:30.050
Houses on the beach,
luxury vacations,

00:30.182 --> 00:32.128
your fancy
Corvette?

00:32.250 --> 00:33.422
I used to think
like you.

00:33.552 --> 00:35.361
Money, success,
all I ever wanted,

00:35.487 --> 00:36.522
but you
know what?

00:36.655 --> 00:37.531
I have
barely seen

00:37.656 --> 00:38.999
my family since
the promotion,

00:39.124 --> 00:42.071
and that
is...

00:44.496 --> 00:47.375
I am
prioritizing.

00:47.499 --> 00:49.274
My family-

00:49.401 --> 00:51.938
They are the
equation, Jack.

00:52.070 --> 00:56.177
They're
everything

00:56.308 --> 00:59.755
I really feel sorry
for you, Jack.

00:59.878 --> 01:01.414
I really do.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:43.622 --> 01:45.431
Alright, bring
it in.

01:45.557 --> 01:47.230
Looks like that new
kid's not gonna show up.

01:47.359 --> 01:48.736
Let's get this
thing started.

01:48.860 --> 01:49.702
What's up man?

01:49.995 --> 01:50.700
I thought you said he
was gonna be here.

01:50.996 --> 01:52.168
That's what
Joey said.

01:52.297 --> 01:54.971
Well, he'd better be
for Joey's sake.

01:55.100 --> 01:58.013
This guy's
weak.

01:58.136 --> 01:59.581
Hey wait up,
wait up.

01:59.704 --> 02:02.150
I'm here.

02:02.274 --> 02:03.514
Luke, get his
money.

02:03.642 --> 02:04.347
He's got it,
he's got it.

02:04.476 --> 02:08.288
Bring the
money?

02:08.413 --> 02:09.413
Give it
to Joey.

02:09.548 --> 02:10.322
Are you serious
right now?

02:10.449 --> 02:11.223
You don't
trust me?

02:11.349 --> 02:12.657
Joey holds
the money.

02:12.784 --> 02:16.960
Wow, man.

02:17.088 --> 02:19.125
Don't lose
it, papa.

02:19.257 --> 02:19.962
Me?

02:20.091 --> 02:21.092
Never.

02:21.226 --> 02:22.261
Alright,
listen up.

02:22.394 --> 02:23.464
Roberto?

02:23.595 --> 02:25.040
Alright everybody got the
course memorized?

02:25.163 --> 02:26.164
Yeah.

02:26.298 --> 02:28.676
Alright let's
do this.

02:28.967 --> 02:31.641
Let's get this
started!

02:31.770 --> 02:34.273
Ready?

02:34.406 --> 02:38.718
Three, two, One, go!

04:43.501 --> 04:44.980
What is this?

04:45.103 --> 04:47.049
Well I was on the way
home from my beat,

04:47.172 --> 04:50.710
and I ran into him and his
knucklehead friends.

04:50.842 --> 04:52.321
So let's get him
on trespassing

04:52.444 --> 04:54.651
and felony
vandalism.

05:02.153 --> 05:02.927
Okay, step
over here.

05:08.126 --> 05:09.332
A seat right
here.

05:17.369 --> 05:18.347
Go ahead and
dial nine

05:18.470 --> 05:20.416
and whatever number
you need to call.

05:20.538 --> 05:22.347
I don't have anyone
to call.

05:22.474 --> 05:24.181
Well then, you're going
to be staying here.

05:29.481 --> 05:30.687
Wait.

05:30.815 --> 05:31.520
Wait, wait, wait,

05:31.650 --> 05:33.254
I have someone I
can call.

05:33.385 --> 05:35.558
Well then go ahead and dial
nine and your number then.

05:45.163 --> 05:47.575
How much was
my bail?

05:47.699 --> 05:48.871
Don't worry
about it.

05:49.000 --> 05:49.740
I'll pay
you back.

05:50.035 --> 05:52.675
Yeah.

05:52.804 --> 05:54.750
Is this how you
spend your days, Caleb?

05:54.873 --> 05:55.749
Hmm?

05:55.874 --> 05:57.012
Not always.

05:57.142 --> 06:00.282
Sometimes I like to,
I like to rob liquor stores.

06:00.412 --> 06:02.119
This is serious.

06:02.247 --> 06:03.419
Alright, it's very
very serious.

06:03.548 --> 06:04.686
You now have
a record.

06:04.816 --> 06:05.487
Congratulations,
you--

06:05.617 --> 06:06.652
Wow.

06:06.785 --> 06:09.095
Wow, all of a sudden
you care.

06:09.220 --> 06:10.460
It's cool how
that happens,

06:10.588 --> 06:11.794
Just like that.

06:11.923 --> 06:14.164
What is going
on with you?

06:14.292 --> 06:15.202
The sergeant
called me,

06:15.326 --> 06:16.600
the sergeant said
that the charges

06:16.728 --> 06:18.207
were trespassing
and vandalism?

06:18.329 --> 06:19.433
Really?

06:19.564 --> 06:21.043
Vandalism and
trespassing?

06:21.166 --> 06:22.236
That's great.

06:22.367 --> 06:24.313
What is going
on with you?

06:24.436 --> 06:25.506
What do you think
is going on?

06:25.637 --> 06:27.207
I have no idea or
I wouldn't be asking.

06:27.338 --> 06:28.112
What is it?

06:28.239 --> 06:31.277
We're getting
evicted.

06:41.753 --> 06:43.664
Look until a couple
of days ago,

06:43.788 --> 06:44.425
you were just--

06:44.556 --> 06:46.001
What?

06:46.124 --> 06:47.728
I was what, another bill for
your accountant to pay?

06:48.026 --> 06:49.300
Can I finish a
sentence please?

06:49.427 --> 06:51.338
You haven't even gone
to see her.

06:51.463 --> 06:52.066
<i>I--</i>

06:52.197 --> 06:52.834
It doesn't matter.

06:52.964 --> 06:55.137
Just, pull over,
please?

06:55.266 --> 06:57.405
Pull over,
I want to go.

07:00.605 --> 07:05.247
Fine I'll
pull over.

07:06.778 --> 07:10.248
Thank you would have
been really nice.

07:10.381 --> 07:12.657
Thanks
a lot.

08:09.474 --> 08:11.476
I can't believe your parents
let you party here.

08:11.609 --> 08:13.418
Yeah well my stepdad's
playing golf,

08:13.545 --> 08:15.752
my mom's probably passed
out on the couch.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.518
You a beer man?

08:17.649 --> 08:22.257
No.

08:22.387 --> 08:23.229
So it's a
bummer, huh?

08:23.354 --> 08:25.027
About your boy
Caleb getting arrested.

08:25.156 --> 08:28.000
Ah, well, who says
he's my boy?

08:28.126 --> 08:29.002
Man you would have
destroyed him

08:29.127 --> 08:30.265
if the cops didn't
show up.

08:30.395 --> 08:33.967
I don't
know, man.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.270
What'd you
say?

08:35.400 --> 08:37.073
What, no, I was
just saying,

08:37.202 --> 08:38.010
I was saying
that he...

08:38.135 --> 08:39.080
You guys were
both ripping.

08:39.203 --> 08:40.706
It's cool man,
it's cool.

08:40.839 --> 08:41.681
Yo, you want me to
take care of--

08:41.806 --> 08:42.648
No, I got him.

08:42.774 --> 08:45.550
No, I heard what
you said.

08:45.677 --> 08:49.682
And you know
what?

08:49.814 --> 08:51.191
And you're
right.

08:51.316 --> 08:51.851
Are you
serious--

08:51.983 --> 08:52.688
He's right.

08:52.817 --> 08:55.730
Are you kidding
me right now?

08:56.020 --> 08:58.193
I got to know
who's better.

08:58.323 --> 09:02.396
You're gonna just let
him slide like that?

09:02.527 --> 09:04.700
Joey, come
here.

09:04.829 --> 09:07.469
You're gonna get him
to do it again.

09:07.599 --> 09:08.634
I don't know if I
can do that,

09:08.766 --> 09:11.406
I have no idea if he
would want to...

09:11.536 --> 09:13.174
I mean he just got picked
up but the police

09:13.304 --> 09:16.183
And I don't know if I can,
he's the cops got... okay.

09:16.307 --> 09:19.618
Gonna get him to do
it again, right?

09:19.744 --> 09:21.018
Right?

09:21.145 --> 09:22.055
<i>Okay-</i>

09:22.180 --> 09:23.215
Joey I can't quite
hear you.

09:23.348 --> 09:24.520
Alright, I'll get him
to do it again.

09:24.649 --> 09:25.320
<i>Okay-</i>

09:25.450 --> 09:26.087
Fine.

09:26.217 --> 09:28.094
We are friends,
Joey, huh?

09:28.219 --> 09:30.392
Let's keep it
that way.

09:37.095 --> 09:38.938
You make it
happen, friend.

09:39.063 --> 09:40.508
What do you think
you're doing?

09:40.632 --> 09:41.337
Going to
skate.

09:41.466 --> 09:42.467
I don't
think so.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.273
The only reason I
let you hang out here

09:44.402 --> 09:46.006
is because my mom
married your dad.

09:46.137 --> 09:47.514
This is not
your ramp.

09:47.639 --> 09:49.118
And we'll never
be bros, huh?

09:49.240 --> 09:50.344
You get it?

09:50.475 --> 09:51.317
Yeah, got--

09:51.442 --> 09:52.716
Get out
of here.

09:57.715 --> 09:58.955
Tight.

10:06.891 --> 10:10.498
Ah, yes, can I speak
to a Mr. Samuels?

10:10.628 --> 10:11.868
Caleb Jones.

10:11.996 --> 10:15.341
Than ks.

10:15.466 --> 10:18.379
Hi, yeah, Mr. Samuels
this is Caleb Jones,

10:18.503 --> 10:22.178
I live at, listen we're
having a hard time

10:22.307 --> 10:26.722
paying our rent
this month and...

10:26.844 --> 10:30.758
Wait, what do you
mean, who--

10:30.882 --> 10:35.456
who?

10:35.586 --> 10:37.395
Yeah, no
that's okay.

10:37.522 --> 10:40.992
Yeah, thanks
anyway.

11:51.629 --> 11:53.575
I don't know how
to say this, Beth.

11:57.769 --> 12:02.013
Time, I don't
know how.

12:02.140 --> 12:04.746
It's been what,
almost twenty years?

12:04.876 --> 12:08.915
It seems
impossible.

12:09.047 --> 12:10.424
So much has changed
and yet I,

12:10.548 --> 12:14.462
I never stopped
loving you.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.594
Ah, Caleb he's
a great kid

12:17.722 --> 12:19.463
and I think he hates
me right now.

12:19.590 --> 12:20.728
And I don't really
blame him

12:20.858 --> 12:23.839
because I kind
of hate myself

12:25.930 --> 12:29.400
a lot of
the time.

12:29.534 --> 12:30.911
Oh, the mistakes
I've made, Beth.

12:31.035 --> 12:32.708
I wish I...

12:36.674 --> 12:38.950
Wish it hadn't taken
this to bring us together.

12:45.516 --> 12:48.122
Please forgive me.

12:48.252 --> 12:50.459
Beth I am so sorry
for not being there for you,

12:50.588 --> 12:53.159
and not being
there for Caleb.

12:57.895 --> 13:01.342
What are you
doing here?

13:01.466 --> 13:06.108
I just
came, um...

13:06.237 --> 13:08.012
If you want me to
leave I'll leave.

13:08.139 --> 13:10.085
Say the word.

13:16.981 --> 13:20.724
How is
she?

13:20.852 --> 13:22.263
No change.

13:27.558 --> 13:28.764
I'm going to get
some coffee.

13:28.893 --> 13:29.598
You want some
coffee?

13:29.727 --> 13:33.265
I'll get you
a cup.

13:33.397 --> 13:35.240
I'll have
a water.

13:39.537 --> 13:41.642
Coming right
up.

14:01.959 --> 14:06.465
Mom, I am so
sorry for everything.

14:08.432 --> 14:12.972
Everything

14:13.104 --> 14:14.708
I know, I know that
everything you did

14:14.839 --> 14:18.252
was to protect
me.

14:18.376 --> 14:20.287
I know that.

14:23.514 --> 14:25.152
I just,

14:25.283 --> 14:27.661
I just want you
to wake up.

14:27.785 --> 14:30.265
Please.

14:30.388 --> 14:32.561
Please
wake up.

14:36.060 --> 14:38.631
Please forgive
me.

14:53.678 --> 14:55.351
For the bible does
tell us all,

14:55.479 --> 14:57.755
as being Christians,

14:57.882 --> 15:00.692
that to be absent
from this body,

15:00.818 --> 15:04.595
means to be present
with Him.

15:04.722 --> 15:06.998
And we know in
our hearts,

15:07.124 --> 15:10.537
That Bethany is
with Him today.

15:10.661 --> 15:14.006
Now cherishing the memories
that are forever precious.

15:14.131 --> 15:18.841
Sustained by a faith that
is stronger than death,

15:18.970 --> 15:23.282
And comforted by a hope of a
life that shall endless be.

15:24.875 --> 15:25.945
All that
is mortal,

15:26.077 --> 15:28.751
Of our beloved
Bethany,

15:28.879 --> 15:30.688
We therefore
commit,

15:30.815 --> 15:34.126
To this final
resting place.

15:34.252 --> 15:37.597
In these beautiful
surroundings.

15:37.722 --> 15:41.568
In the assurance that if this
earthly tin of our body,

15:41.692 --> 15:45.003
being dissolved, we have a
building from God,

15:45.129 --> 15:46.733
Not made
with hands,

15:47.031 --> 15:48.203
but one that
will return

15:48.332 --> 15:50.972
to the dust from
which it came.

15:51.102 --> 15:54.413
Let us bow in
prayer, please.

15:54.538 --> 15:57.246
Lord Jesus we thank
You so much.

15:57.375 --> 15:59.616
That we serve
a God,

15:59.744 --> 16:02.156
That's infinite yet
here today.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.691
And that You
care so much

16:03.814 --> 16:05.020
about what's going
on in our hearts,

16:05.149 --> 16:06.890
in our lives.

16:07.018 --> 16:08.395
Caleb.

16:08.519 --> 16:09.725
Caleb!

16:09.854 --> 16:10.764
What?

16:10.888 --> 16:12.595
What do
you want?

16:12.723 --> 16:15.363
Where are
you going?

16:15.493 --> 16:17.097
Away from
here.

16:17.228 --> 16:18.366
What about your
mother's funeral?

16:18.496 --> 16:21.306
I can't keep pretending
that you're my father.

16:21.432 --> 16:25.073
Or that my mom's gonna
be home when I get there.

16:25.202 --> 16:26.340
She's dead.

16:26.470 --> 16:28.074
And I can't stop
thinking that

16:28.205 --> 16:30.014
If you were there to
help she wouldn't be.

16:30.141 --> 16:32.519
Okay you listen
to me a second.

16:32.643 --> 16:34.919
A lovely woman is dead,
yes that's true,

16:35.046 --> 16:38.653
But I loved
her too.

16:38.783 --> 16:40.694
Okay and I'm sorry,
I wasn't there--

16:40.818 --> 16:43.856
She deserves a lot
more from you than "sorry."

16:43.988 --> 16:47.128
Jack.

16:47.258 --> 16:49.795
I wish you two
had never met.

16:49.927 --> 16:52.840
Hey.

16:52.963 --> 16:56.103
Like it or not,
I'm your father.

16:56.233 --> 16:58.679
No you're
not.

16:58.803 --> 17:00.942
A father is someone who
takes care of his family,

17:01.072 --> 17:03.712
who is there for his
family when they need him.

17:03.841 --> 17:08.118
All you are is some guy that got
my mom pregnant and you left.

17:08.244 --> 17:09.815
When I
was seven,

17:09.946 --> 17:11.392
all the kids at school
had their dads come

17:11.515 --> 17:15.122
and talk about
what they do.

17:15.252 --> 17:16.992
And I told everyone
that my dad couldn't make it

17:17.121 --> 17:20.864
because, because he was
an astronaut.

17:25.996 --> 17:29.375
I have never forgot
that feeling,

17:29.500 --> 17:33.949
I just wanted
to disappear.

17:34.071 --> 17:36.847
You've got no idea
what you've lost.

17:36.974 --> 17:38.612
I think
I do.

17:43.547 --> 17:45.823
And I have to
live with that,

17:45.950 --> 17:49.090
every day of my life
because now,

17:49.220 --> 17:51.757
it's too late.

17:51.889 --> 17:53.596
And you believe me, all that
hatred, all that anger

17:53.724 --> 17:57.831
you feel inside toward me I
feel it toward myself tenfold.

17:57.962 --> 18:01.341
Tenfold.

18:01.465 --> 18:04.105
I know I
made mistakes.

18:04.235 --> 18:05.407
I know l
said things

18:05.536 --> 18:06.708
and I know that I can't take
those things back,

18:06.837 --> 18:09.374
but you are a man and I am
asking you,

18:09.507 --> 18:12.681
as a man to please dig inside
yourself and see if maybe

18:12.810 --> 18:15.484
you just can
forgive me.

18:15.613 --> 18:17.559
Give me a shot,
give me a chance

18:17.681 --> 18:19.627
One chance.

18:57.655 --> 19:00.568
What does the Lord say about
forgiveness?

19:00.691 --> 19:02.728
And Peter came
to him and asked,

19:02.860 --> 19:04.737
Lord, how many times
should I forgive someone

19:05.029 --> 19:07.236
who has sinned
against me?

19:07.364 --> 19:08.968
Seven times?

19:09.099 --> 19:11.670
And the Lord said no,
not seven times.

19:11.802 --> 19:13.645
But seventy
times seven.

19:13.771 --> 19:16.479
Now is the time to confess
your sins and ask forgiveness

19:16.607 --> 19:18.348
before it's
too late.

19:18.476 --> 19:21.423
<i>God is good.</i>

19:21.545 --> 19:22.717
Is he Ralf?

19:22.847 --> 19:24.417
Is <i>God good?</i>

19:24.548 --> 19:26.687
God is
always good.

19:26.817 --> 19:28.956
My mom's
dead.

19:29.086 --> 19:31.032
How good
can he be?

19:54.345 --> 19:55.085
What do
you want?

19:55.212 --> 19:56.486
I want my
money back.

19:56.614 --> 19:58.218
I ain't got
your money.

19:58.349 --> 19:59.157
Yeah?

19:59.283 --> 20:00.728
Where's Ryder?

20:01.018 --> 20:03.294
I don't know, he's somewhere,
he's around, I don't know.

20:03.420 --> 20:07.027
Well tell him
I want my money back.

20:07.157 --> 20:08.431
I don't even know why
you're stressing,

20:08.559 --> 20:10.163
you would have lost
it anyways, so,

20:10.294 --> 20:12.001
just chill man.

20:16.467 --> 20:19.676
Tell Ryder, I'm gonna
get my money back.

20:22.506 --> 20:25.146
Yo, you don't belong
out here, alright?

20:25.276 --> 20:28.883
Go back to where
you belong, son.

20:29.013 --> 20:30.083
That's
right, punk.

20:47.865 --> 20:51.813
<i>Come on.</i>

20:51.936 --> 20:54.143
Where'd you keep
this at, Mom?

22:54.692 --> 22:56.137
Why would you
do this to me?

22:56.260 --> 23:00.299
Did I do something
to deserve this?

23:00.431 --> 23:03.935
I want
to die.

23:30.127 --> 23:35.008
See what your plan
is for me now, God.

24:01.925 --> 24:03.768
Caleb?

24:12.836 --> 24:14.679
Caleb?

24:16.740 --> 24:18.981
Are you
here?

24:27.050 --> 24:28.222
Caleb?

24:40.297 --> 24:41.571
Caleb?

24:45.636 --> 24:48.139
Hey!

24:48.272 --> 24:49.216
Caleb,

24:55.279 --> 24:56.690
<i>No, no, no, no,
Caleb, hey!</i>

24:56.814 --> 24:58.452
Caleb, hey,
come on!

24:58.582 --> 24:59.356
Wake up, son!

24:59.483 --> 25:01.121
Caleb!

25:01.251 --> 25:05.097
Doctor Sheldon,
this is Jack Sanders,

25:05.222 --> 25:08.135
Caleb's father.

25:08.258 --> 25:09.601
Listen, I'm afraid that Caleb
might have gotten into

25:09.726 --> 25:11.137
some of his
mother's medication

25:11.261 --> 25:12.740
and I would like you
to take a look at him,

25:12.863 --> 25:17.334
because I'm afraid that he
might have overdosed.

25:17.467 --> 25:19.310
I don't know what it was,
but it was only supposed

25:19.436 --> 25:21.109
to be one every
four hours,

25:21.238 --> 25:23.309
and he took a whole
lot more than that.

25:27.311 --> 25:29.257
If you don't mind it's kind
of a sensitive issue.

25:32.316 --> 25:37.095
I'd like you to come to
my house if you don't mind.

25:37.221 --> 25:39.531
Thank you.

26:01.211 --> 26:02.884
Just pumped
his stomach,

26:03.013 --> 26:03.753
He's doing
fine, now.

26:04.047 --> 26:05.549
Vitals are
strong.

26:05.682 --> 26:07.525
He just needs to
get some sleep.

26:07.651 --> 26:08.425
Doc, I found your
cell number

26:08.552 --> 26:09.690
on that card in
his back pocket,

26:09.820 --> 26:11.390
so, can we just,

26:11.521 --> 26:13.660
keep this between
you and I?

26:13.790 --> 26:16.066
Yeah.

26:16.193 --> 26:18.332
He's been
through a lot.

26:18.462 --> 26:21.705
I'm happy to
have helped.

26:21.999 --> 26:23.137
He has, look,
I can't...

26:23.267 --> 26:24.507
I can't thank
you enough.

26:24.635 --> 26:25.841
What--

26:25.969 --> 26:30.679
Take good care
of your son.

27:57.961 --> 28:01.340
Well good morning,
sunshine.

28:01.465 --> 28:04.708
Or should I say
good late afternoon?

28:04.835 --> 28:06.212
<i>Look I got you
a nice,</i>

28:06.336 --> 28:08.646
well, now cold,
greasy cheeseburger.

28:08.772 --> 28:10.718
Great for
a hangover.

28:10.841 --> 28:12.582
Come on down, I'll stick
it in the microwave.

28:30.961 --> 28:32.702
Ah.

28:32.829 --> 28:34.433
Forty-five
minute shower.

28:34.564 --> 28:37.443
You've obviously never paid
a water bill in your life.

28:40.203 --> 28:41.204
Have a seat.

28:47.778 --> 28:51.123
How you feeling?

28:51.248 --> 28:53.524
I feel like,

28:53.650 --> 28:56.859
like a dinosaur
bit my head.

29:00.390 --> 29:01.266
I like that.

29:01.391 --> 29:02.267
That's a
good one.

29:02.392 --> 29:04.429
I like it,
I'm using that.

29:07.798 --> 29:09.334
Can I ask you
a question?

29:09.466 --> 29:10.342
Yeah.

29:10.467 --> 29:12.140
Go ahead,
shoot

29:12.269 --> 29:15.250
Why didn't
you want me?

29:25.115 --> 29:27.152
I was young,

29:27.284 --> 29:30.390
I was stupid.

29:30.520 --> 29:33.126
And I'm
very sorry.

29:38.628 --> 29:41.234
Where's the burger?

29:41.364 --> 29:44.106
I ate it.

29:44.234 --> 29:45.736
You serious?

29:45.869 --> 29:47.906
No, it's in
the microwave.

29:48.038 --> 29:48.982
Heated it up
three times,

29:49.106 --> 29:52.485
it's probably hard
as a rock.

29:52.609 --> 29:54.555
I'll eat anything
right now.

30:05.355 --> 30:07.835
What's that
supposed to mean?

31:09.252 --> 31:11.198
Think that's
really gonna help?

31:19.029 --> 31:22.476
I didn't know anybody knew
about this spot.

31:22.599 --> 31:23.600
They don't
man.

31:23.733 --> 31:26.907
I'm Brian.

31:27.037 --> 31:28.107
Caleb.

31:28.238 --> 31:30.582
So you want to
skate or what?

31:30.707 --> 31:33.347
No, man, I kind of
just wanted to be...

31:33.476 --> 31:34.921
To be alone?

31:35.045 --> 31:35.716
I know how
that goes,

31:35.845 --> 31:37.449
I know how
you feel.

31:37.581 --> 31:38.389
Oh you
think so?

31:38.515 --> 31:39.653
Yeah.

31:39.783 --> 31:41.319
Been to plenty of spots just
like this back home.

31:41.451 --> 31:42.589
I go skate there
all the time.

31:42.719 --> 31:47.361
All by myself,
all alone.

31:47.490 --> 31:48.332
Where's home?

31:48.458 --> 31:49.960
Liverpool,
back in England.

31:50.093 --> 31:51.333
You know when I was
going through some stuff,

31:51.461 --> 31:53.236
the challenges of life,
the things that

31:53.363 --> 31:57.334
I tried to drink away or party
away or smoke away perhaps,

31:57.467 --> 32:01.643
but that never
really helped.

32:01.771 --> 32:03.341
Well then
what helps?

32:08.912 --> 32:09.720
Take it
easy, man.

32:09.846 --> 32:11.154
Good talking
to you Caleb.

32:16.486 --> 32:18.864
Yo.

32:18.989 --> 32:20.366
Thought you
wanted to skate?

32:20.490 --> 32:23.664
Thought you wanted
to be alone?

32:23.960 --> 32:26.372
Grab your board, let's go,
let's go skate.

35:33.483 --> 35:38.193
Your father will not
forgive your sins.

35:47.397 --> 35:49.035
Dear Caleb,

35:49.165 --> 35:51.008
If you are
reading this,

35:51.134 --> 35:54.604
my prayers have
been answered.

35:54.737 --> 35:56.546
I know growing up
without a father

35:56.673 --> 35:58.949
has been very
hard for you

35:59.242 --> 36:02.587
and I know I haven't
always been the best mother.

36:02.712 --> 36:07.161
But I've always tried to do
what I thought was best for you.

36:07.283 --> 36:09.456
I love you
so much,

36:09.586 --> 36:11.065
that I thought if I
made you believe

36:11.187 --> 36:15.966
that your father and
I were a one time encounter

36:16.092 --> 36:18.766
that you would
hurt less.

36:18.895 --> 36:21.637
I know now that I was
wrong for that,

36:21.764 --> 36:23.744
and I'm very sorry.

36:23.867 --> 36:26.643
The truth is, that
I loved your father,

36:26.769 --> 36:28.715
and I still do,

36:28.838 --> 36:32.183
and you were created
from that love.

36:32.308 --> 36:33.514
So I hope you
can find it

36:33.643 --> 36:36.453
in your heart
some day to forgive me.

36:36.579 --> 36:37.922
I love you.

36:38.214 --> 36:40.285
Mom.

36:56.432 --> 36:57.536
Caleb?

36:59.769 --> 37:01.840
Hey Ralf.

37:03.907 --> 37:05.853
Why do you
do this?

37:05.975 --> 37:07.955
Do what?

37:08.077 --> 37:08.714
This, why do you,

37:08.845 --> 37:10.825
why do you live
like this?

37:14.117 --> 37:18.623
It enables me to spread
the word of God.

37:18.755 --> 37:23.329
What about
your family?

37:23.459 --> 37:26.804
It was Easter
Sunday.

37:26.930 --> 37:29.240
Me and my wife and
my daughter were going

37:29.365 --> 37:32.539
on a three day trip to visit
my mother in law for Easter.

37:32.669 --> 37:34.410
Do you like my
dress, daddy?

37:34.537 --> 37:35.777
It's beautiful,
sweetheart.

37:35.905 --> 37:37.509
Are we ready to
go to grandma's?

37:37.640 --> 37:39.142
Yeah!

37:39.275 --> 37:40.549
It's my
secretary,

37:40.677 --> 37:42.520
she wouldn't page me unless
it was really important.

37:42.645 --> 37:47.151
Honey, you promised no
work till we get back.

37:47.283 --> 37:50.730
My secretary
called and

37:50.853 --> 37:52.298
I forgot to sign
off on a case

37:52.422 --> 37:54.629
that had to be postmarked
the next day.

37:54.757 --> 37:57.636
I had to go to
the office.

37:57.760 --> 38:00.263
So I sent my wife and my
daughter to go ahead.

38:04.901 --> 38:09.043
They never
made it.

38:09.172 --> 38:12.153
Drunk driver
crossed the line.

38:12.275 --> 38:16.690
Hit 'em
head on.

38:16.813 --> 38:19.419
I should have
been driving.

38:27.957 --> 38:30.267
My daughter would be
twenty-two today.

38:35.031 --> 38:39.605
After that I
just gave up.

38:39.736 --> 38:40.646
I couldn't accept
the fact

38:40.770 --> 38:44.217
that I'd never
see them again.

38:44.340 --> 38:47.378
Never hold my wife or
hear my daughter say

38:47.510 --> 38:52.357
Daddy, I
love you.

38:52.482 --> 38:54.792
Sol crawled into
a bottle and took

38:54.917 --> 38:57.864
whatever pills I could
get my hands on,

39:01.024 --> 39:04.528
What happened to
the driver?

39:04.661 --> 39:09.337
He got three years
for manslaughter.

39:09.465 --> 39:12.412
I hated that man more than
anything else in the world.

39:14.737 --> 39:16.307
I wished every day
that the same thing

39:16.439 --> 39:18.510
would happen to
his family.

39:21.544 --> 39:24.218
Till one day,

39:24.347 --> 39:27.328
I realized that
all that hate

39:27.450 --> 39:31.330
was never going to
bring 'em back.

39:31.454 --> 39:33.832
And it was slowly
killing me.

39:36.492 --> 39:39.905
So what'd
you do?

39:40.196 --> 39:42.301
I forgave him.

39:45.034 --> 39:47.605
It's time for you to
forgive yourself.

40:18.668 --> 40:19.612
Sup?

40:23.873 --> 40:28.015
I'm really sorry
about your mom.

40:28.144 --> 40:30.522
Than ks.

40:34.584 --> 40:37.724
What're you gonna do
about Ryder?

40:37.854 --> 40:41.199
What am I supposed
to do?

40:41.324 --> 40:43.634
You got to do
something, man.

40:43.760 --> 40:45.137
Why?

40:45.261 --> 40:46.934
What's the point
of it?

40:47.063 --> 40:49.703
Well he keeps...

40:49.832 --> 40:51.778
Saying...

40:51.901 --> 40:53.744
What?

40:53.870 --> 40:55.781
What happened
to your lip?

40:59.275 --> 41:01.221
Did Ryder
do that?

41:05.848 --> 41:07.794
Man this has
got to stop.

41:11.687 --> 41:13.257
Tell Ryder
I'm in.

41:13.389 --> 41:16.063
But we do
it my way.

41:16.192 --> 41:20.504
The skate
park.

41:20.630 --> 41:22.769
Sorry.

41:31.240 --> 41:34.710
Big day,
Jack.

41:34.844 --> 41:37.415
You alright?

41:37.547 --> 41:38.457
Huh?

41:38.581 --> 41:41.653
What, uh, yeah.

41:41.784 --> 41:45.322
Yes, I'm
fine.

41:45.454 --> 41:46.990
'Cause if you're concerned
about the meeting today

41:47.123 --> 41:48.124
with the inspector,
it's not--

41:48.257 --> 41:49.861
No, not concerned,
not concerned at all.

41:49.992 --> 41:52.097
In fact I think your plan
is just great.

41:52.228 --> 41:53.104
Great.

41:53.229 --> 41:55.266
You know,

41:55.398 --> 41:59.039
a very wise
man once told me,

41:59.168 --> 42:01.011
in fact he was standing right
about where you are now,

42:01.137 --> 42:03.014
that his family
was more important

42:03.139 --> 42:05.210
than his job.

42:05.341 --> 42:06.649
And I could never
seem to wrap

42:06.776 --> 42:10.485
my mind around
that until today.

42:10.613 --> 42:14.390
So I would like
to thank you.

42:14.517 --> 42:16.929
For accepting
my apology,

42:17.053 --> 42:21.331
and for coming
back to the firm.

42:21.457 --> 42:24.870
You're welcome,
Jack.

42:25.161 --> 42:27.664
I got
to go.

42:27.797 --> 42:28.502
What the...

42:28.631 --> 42:30.338
what about
the meeting?

42:30.466 --> 42:34.312
I've got something far more
important than that meeting.

42:34.437 --> 42:37.418
You have a good
day, Bill.

42:37.540 --> 42:39.747
Enjoy it,
partner.

42:50.653 --> 42:51.597
<i>Okay-</i>

43:40.269 --> 43:41.680
Hey, Ryder!

43:41.804 --> 43:42.976
Hosoi.

43:43.105 --> 43:44.345
Sup buddy
huh? <i>'</i>

43:44.473 --> 43:46.510
<i>No, no,
no, no.</i>

43:46.642 --> 43:48.417
What's the
problem?

43:48.544 --> 43:50.251
You think the only reason I
sponsor you is because

43:50.379 --> 43:53.121
you're some
great skateboarder?

43:53.249 --> 43:55.195
I don't know what
you're talking about.

44:01.791 --> 44:03.964
Man if you search deep
down in your heart, Ryder,

44:04.093 --> 44:09.008
you'll discover why l sponsored
you in the first place.

44:49.205 --> 44:51.082
Man, these kids.

44:51.207 --> 44:53.710
Yep, what's it going
to benefit them

44:53.843 --> 44:56.016
if they gain the
whole world?

44:56.145 --> 44:58.386
They forfeit
their own souls.

45:12.928 --> 45:17.138
Yo, Joey.

45:17.266 --> 45:18.904
Hey, JOEY-

45:19.035 --> 45:21.447
Where's your
boy?

45:21.570 --> 45:22.605
He'll be
here.

45:22.738 --> 45:26.686
Yeah, I hope he
doesn't chicken out.

45:26.809 --> 45:28.982
Yo, made
it.

45:29.111 --> 45:30.613
Hey where
you been?

45:30.746 --> 45:31.918
Had to fix
my board.

45:32.048 --> 45:33.493
Is your
boy ready?

45:33.616 --> 45:34.993
Yeah man,
I'm ready.

45:35.117 --> 45:35.891
You sure?

45:36.018 --> 45:38.521
Yeah.

45:38.654 --> 45:40.190
It's trick
for trick.

45:40.322 --> 45:42.063
If someone misses
a trick,

45:42.191 --> 45:44.262
the other skater gets
to choose the next trick.

45:44.393 --> 45:44.837
Clear?

45:44.960 --> 45:45.335
YEP <i>-</i>

45:45.461 --> 45:45.734
<i>Okay-</i>

45:45.861 --> 45:46.339
Alright,

45:46.462 --> 45:47.566
flip a coin,

45:47.696 --> 45:49.039
see who
goes first.

45:49.165 --> 45:49.836
Who calls?

45:49.965 --> 45:50.909
I'll call
it.

45:54.970 --> 45:58.213
Heads.

45:58.340 --> 45:59.785
Yeah.

45:59.909 --> 46:00.649
Heads.

46:00.776 --> 46:03.017
Ryder goes
first.

46:03.145 --> 46:04.988
I get first
trick.

46:05.114 --> 46:07.720
Let's see if you
can keep up.

46:07.850 --> 46:09.227
Let's see.

46:42.118 --> 46:43.495
Yeah.

47:25.895 --> 47:28.739
<i>Come on,
man.</i>

47:28.864 --> 47:29.638
What's going
on, man?

47:29.765 --> 47:33.872
Dude, I cracked
my trucks.

47:34.003 --> 47:35.107
It's
over.

47:35.237 --> 47:36.147
What?

47:36.272 --> 47:37.307
Is that
it?

47:37.439 --> 47:39.043
Huh, you
giving up?

47:39.175 --> 47:42.588
Oh man, you're
such a baby.

47:45.781 --> 47:48.352
Don't listen
to him, man,

47:48.484 --> 47:49.861
You got
to try.

47:49.985 --> 47:51.396
Caleb.

47:51.520 --> 47:54.524
And you
know what?

47:54.657 --> 47:56.830
Chill.

48:04.466 --> 48:06.446
Maybe it's time
you tried this.

48:36.165 --> 48:39.203
So what are
you gonna do?

48:39.335 --> 48:40.939
Hardflip
backlip.

48:41.070 --> 48:43.744
You serious?

48:43.872 --> 48:44.907
Do you really think
now's the time

48:45.207 --> 48:48.017
to be doing something
you've never done before?

48:48.143 --> 48:51.215
Now's the
perfect time.

48:51.347 --> 48:54.794
Alright.

48:54.917 --> 48:56.863
Kill it.
