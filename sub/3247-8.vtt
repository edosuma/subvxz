WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:03.838
Get down!

00:05.297 --> 00:06.719
- Did they see you?
- I don't know.

00:06.798 --> 00:08.391
- But did they see you?
- I was too busy running!

00:08.467 --> 00:10.469
Martha, it's important,
did they see your face?

00:10.552 --> 00:13.271
- No, they couldn't have.
- Off we go.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.936
Ah! They're following us.

00:19.061 --> 00:20.779
How can they do that?
You've got a time machine.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.949
Stolen technology. They've got
a time agent's vortex manipulator.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.243
They can follow us wherever we go.

00:26.318 --> 00:29.618
Right across the universe.
They're never going to stop.

00:30.822 --> 00:33.291
Unless... I'll have to do it.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.161
- Martha, you trust me, don't you?
- Of course I do.

00:36.286 --> 00:39.335
- 'Cause it all depends on you.
- What does? What am I supposed to do?

00:39.456 --> 00:41.925
Take this watch
because my life depends on it.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.378
This watch, Martha, this watch is...

01:00.686 --> 01:02.404
Come in.

01:02.479 --> 01:05.403
Pardon me, Mr Smith, you're not
dressed yet. I can come back later.

01:05.482 --> 01:08.406
No, it's all right, it's all right,
put it down.

01:10.529 --> 01:12.076
I was...

01:14.825 --> 01:16.418
Sorry, sorry-

01:17.703 --> 01:20.502
Sometimes I have
these extraordinary dreams.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.130
- What about, sir?
- I dream I'm this...

01:24.251 --> 01:26.299
adventurer.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.764
This daredevil, a madman.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.596
"The Doctor", I'm called.

01:31.675 --> 01:35.396
And last night,
I dreamt that you were there,

01:36.430 --> 01:39.479
as my... companion.

01:39.558 --> 01:42.732
A teacher and a housemaid, sir?
That's impossible.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.322
I'm a man from another world, you know.

01:45.397 --> 01:48.196
Well, then it can't be true
'cause there's no such thing.

01:48.275 --> 01:51.028
This thing, the watch...

01:56.241 --> 01:58.164
It's funny how dreams slip away.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.166
But I do remember one thing.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.464
It all took place in the future.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.967
In the year of our Lord, 2007.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.886
I can prove that wrong for you, sir.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.092
Here's the morning paper.

02:10.172 --> 02:14.348
It's Monday November 10, 1913,
and you're completely human, sir.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.305
- As human as they come.
- Mmm. That's me.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.854
Completely human.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.797
Good morning, sir.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.922
Good morning, sir.

03:36.299 --> 03:37.642
Headmaster.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.273
"The French were all but spent,"

03:44.349 --> 03:47.102
"with only two battalions
of the old guard remaining."

03:47.185 --> 03:51.156
"The final reserve force
was charged with protecting Napoleon."

03:51.690 --> 03:54.409
"But by evening,
the advance of the allied troops"

03:54.484 --> 03:57.203
"had forced them to retreat."

04:04.578 --> 04:06.501
Morning, sir.

04:06.621 --> 04:07.964
Yes, hi.

04:10.876 --> 04:15.723
Head in the clouds, that one.
I don't know why you're so sweet on him.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.765
He’s just kind to me, that's all.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.094
Not everyone's that considerate,
what with me being...

04:20.177 --> 04:23.431
- A Londoner?
- Exactly. Good old London town!

04:24.848 --> 04:26.600
Now then, you two.

04:26.767 --> 04:30.567
You're not paid to have fun, are you?
Put a little backbone into it.

04:30.645 --> 04:34.149
- Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
- You there. What's your name again?

04:34.232 --> 04:35.905
Martha, sir. Martha Jones.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.660
Well, tell me then, Jones,

04:37.736 --> 04:41.707
with hands like those,
how can you tell when something's clean?

04:44.075 --> 04:47.670
- That's very funny, sir.
- Careful now, don't tense about it.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.295
I'd like to smack my bucket
over his head.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.341
Oh, I wish!

04:53.710 --> 04:55.804
Just think, though.

04:55.879 --> 04:59.725
In a few years' time, boys like that
will be running the country.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.222
1913.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.058
They might not.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.350
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Oh, good morning, Mr Smith.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.401
Oh! Here we go.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.397
- Let me help you.
- No, no, I've got it, no.

05:14.648 --> 05:18.824
Er... just to retrieve...
So, if you could take these...

05:18.902 --> 05:20.449
Thank you.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.327
- There we are.
- Good.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.622
No harm done.

05:23.698 --> 05:26.577
- So, how was Jenkins?
- Oh, just a cold, nothing serious.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.128
I think he's missing his mother
more than anything.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.417
Ah, can't have that.

05:29.538 --> 05:31.791
He received a letter this morning,
so he's a lot more chipper.

05:31.873 --> 05:35.844
- I appear to be holding your books.
- Yes, so you are, sorry. Sorry.

05:35.919 --> 05:39.173
- Yes, just let me...
- No, why don't I take half?

05:39.256 --> 05:42.601
Brilliant idea. Brilliant. Perfect.
Division of labour.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.596
- We make quite a team.
- Don't we just?

05:46.388 --> 05:50.018
So these books, were they being taken
in any particular direction?

05:50.100 --> 05:53.479
Yes, um, this way.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.074
I always say, Matron, you give the boys
a good head of steam,

05:58.149 --> 06:00.527
they'll soon wear themselves out.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.487
Truth be told,
when it's just you and me,

06:02.612 --> 06:04.865
I'd much rather
you call me Nurse Redfern.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.201
Matron sounds rather, well, matronly.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.833
Ah! Nurse Redfern it is, then.

06:10.036 --> 06:13.256
Though we've known each other all of
two months, you could even say Joan.

06:13.331 --> 06:14.924
Joan?
- That's my name.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.252
Well, obviously.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.382
- And it's John, isn't it?
- Yes, it is, yes.

06:18.461 --> 06:21.715
Have you seen this, John? The annual
dance at the village hall tomorrow?

06:21.798 --> 06:24.722
It's nothing formal,
but rather fun by all accounts.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.644
Do you think you'll go?

06:28.138 --> 06:29.731
I hadn't thought about it.

06:29.806 --> 06:33.686
It's been ages since I've been
to a dance, only no one's asked me.

06:35.312 --> 06:38.156
Well, I should imagine that you'd be...

06:38.231 --> 06:41.485
I mean... I mean,
I never thought you'd be one for...

06:41.568 --> 06:44.037
There's no reason why you shouldn't,
if you do, you may not...

06:44.154 --> 06:46.156
I probably won't,
but even if I did, then I...

06:46.281 --> 06:49.330
- I couldn't, um... I wouldn't want to...
- The stairs.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.958
- What about the stairs?
- They're right behind you.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.676
Stop it. I get boys
causing less fuss than this.

06:58.793 --> 06:59.965
But it hurts.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.343
- Is he all right?
- Excuse me, Martha.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.933
It's hardly good form to enter
a master's study without knocking.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.181
Sorry. You're right, yeah.

07:08.970 --> 07:12.019
But is he all right?
They said you fell down the stairs, sir.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.396
It was just a tumble, that's all.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.478
- Have you checked for concussion?
- I have.

07:16.561 --> 07:19.906
And I dare say
I know a lot more about it than you.

07:20.607 --> 07:24.077
Sorry. I’ll just tidy your things.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.664
I was just telling
Nurse Redfern, Matron,

07:28.740 --> 07:32.210
about my dreams.
They are quite remarkable tales.

07:33.203 --> 07:37.299
I keep imagining that I'm someone else
and that I'm hiding.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.251
Hiding. In what way?

07:39.584 --> 07:40.927
Erm...

07:41.044 --> 07:43.547
They're almost every night and...

07:43.630 --> 07:46.053
- This is going to sound silly.
- Tell me.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.390
I dream, quite often, that...

07:50.220 --> 07:51.972
That I have two hearts.

07:52.055 --> 07:55.229
Well then, I can be the judge of that.
Let's find out.

08:10.073 --> 08:13.828
I can confirm the diagnosis.
Just one heart. Singular.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.414
I have, um, I have written down

08:17.497 --> 08:20.501
some of these dreams
in the form of fiction.

08:21.543 --> 08:24.012
- Not that it would be of any interest.
- I'd be very interested.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.636
Yeah? Well...

08:28.758 --> 08:31.932
Never actually
shown it to anyone before.

08:34.304 --> 08:36.933
"A journal of Impossible Things."

08:43.565 --> 08:46.159
Look at these creatures.
Such imagination.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.904
- Oh. It's become quite a hobby.
- Oh.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.628
It's wonderful.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.499
You have quite an eye
for the pretty girls.

09:00.582 --> 09:05.304
Oh, no, no, she’s just an invention.
This character Rose. I call her Rose.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.632
Seems to disappear later on.

09:14.012 --> 09:17.141
Oh, that's the box, the blue box.
It's always there.

09:17.307 --> 09:20.060
Like a magic carpet...

09:20.143 --> 09:23.773
This fun little box that transports me
to faraway places.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.732
- Like a doorway?
- Mmm.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.860
I sometimes think

09:28.943 --> 09:31.867
how magical life would be
if stories like this were true.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.456
If only.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.035
It's just a dream.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.375
Ma'am.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.420
- That book.
- Oh, I'll look after it, don't worry.

09:46.503 --> 09:49.882
- He did say I could read it.
- But it's silly, that's all.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.926
Just stories.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.728
- Who is he, Martha?
- I'm sorry?

09:55.804 --> 09:59.149
It's like he's left the kettle on,
like he knows he has something

09:59.224 --> 10:01.773
to get back to,
but he can't remember what.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.354
- It's just him.
- You arrived with him, didn't you?

10:04.479 --> 10:06.879
He found you employment here
at the school, isn't that right?

10:06.898 --> 10:10.368
I used to work for the family.
He just sort of inherited me.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.196
Well, I'd be careful.
If you don't mind my saying,

10:13.321 --> 10:15.540
you sometimes seem
a little familiar with him.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.868
Best remember your position.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.870
Yes, ma'am.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.083
Ah, Latimer, here you are.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.964
Latin translation.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.637
Blasted Catullus.
I want it done by morning.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.806
- Yes, sir.
- And no mistakes.

10:31.881 --> 10:34.509
I want it written
in my best handwriting.

10:34.592 --> 10:38.563
Listen, Father says he's been promoted.
That means more money.

10:38.680 --> 10:42.230
- Might end up in a better school.
- Ah, you should enjoy it, sir.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.232
My uncle had a six-month posting
in Johannesburg.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.939
Says it was the most beautiful
countryside on God's earth.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.366
- What are you talking about?
- Africa.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.409
- Your father.
- Have you been reading my post?

10:52.527 --> 10:54.495
- What?
- Who said Africa?

10:55.363 --> 10:57.912
I've only just read the word myself.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.535
- How did you know that?
- I haven't...

11:00.618 --> 11:04.043
- Have you been spying on me?
- No. I just guessed.

11:04.122 --> 11:08.502
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I'm good at guessing, that's all.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.053
Idiot.

11:14.757 --> 11:18.011
Sometimes I say things
and they turn out to be correct.

11:18.094 --> 11:22.395
Just little things. Tiny things.
I can't help it.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.944
It's just some sort of luck.

11:27.729 --> 11:30.323
Right. Well, never mind
that little toad. Who's for beer?

11:30.398 --> 11:31.615
You've got beer?

11:31.691 --> 11:34.695
No, but Baxter's hidden a secret supply
in Blackdown Woods.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.950
Well, what are you waiting for?

11:37.030 --> 11:39.874
Make sure the bursar's down the pub
before you go past his window.

11:39.949 --> 11:43.249
- A bottle for everyone, is it?
- And none for the filth.

11:43.995 --> 11:46.293
And hurry back, Baines. I'm parched.

11:49.667 --> 11:53.171
Ooh, it's freezing out here. Why can't
we have a drink inside the pub?

11:53.254 --> 11:55.973
Don't be ridiculous.
You do get these notions.

11:56.090 --> 11:59.890
It's all very well those suffragettes,
but that's London. That's miles away.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.722
Don't you want to scream sometimes,
having to bow and scrape and behave?

12:02.805 --> 12:05.228
- Don't you just want to tell them?
- I don't know.

12:05.308 --> 12:07.231
Things must be different
in your country.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.733
Well, they are.
Thank God I'm not staying here.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.314
You keep saying that.

12:11.439 --> 12:15.410
Just you wait. One more month
and I'm as free as the wind.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.738
Wish you could come with me, jenny.
You'd love it.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.198
- Where you gonna go?
- Anywhere.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.033
Just look up there.

12:22.659 --> 12:25.833
Imagine you could go all the way
out to the stars.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.923
You don't half say mad things.

12:29.123 --> 12:32.718
That's where I'm going.
Into the sky, all the way out.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.758
Hmm!

12:37.632 --> 12:39.350
Did you see that?

12:39.425 --> 12:41.598
- See what?
- Did you see it, though?

12:41.678 --> 12:43.851
Right up there, just for a second.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.940
Martha, there's nothing there.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.189
Matron, are you all right?

13:30.268 --> 13:32.817
Did you see that?
There was something in the woods.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.148
- This light.
- Anything wrong, ladies?

13:35.231 --> 13:37.233
Far too cold
to be standing round in the dark.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.196
There. There. Look, in the sky.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.747
Oh, that's beautiful.

13:43.781 --> 13:47.786
All gone. Commonly known as a meteorite.

13:48.411 --> 13:51.836
It's just rocks falling to the ground,
that's all.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.166
Came down in the woods.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.970
No, no, they always look close,
but actually they're miles off.

13:57.045 --> 13:59.673
Nothing left but a cinder.

13:59.756 --> 14:03.226
Now, I should escort you
back to the school.

14:03.301 --> 14:05.850
- Ladies?
- No, we're fine, thanks.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.056
Then I shall bid you good night.

14:10.058 --> 14:12.106
Jenny, where was that?

14:12.185 --> 14:14.153
On the horizon,
where the light was headed.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.777
That's by Coopers Field.

14:16.856 --> 14:20.531
You can't just run off! It's dark.
You'll break a leg!

15:03.111 --> 15:04.829
I say, hello?

15:07.824 --> 15:09.918
Some kind of aeroplane?

15:12.161 --> 15:14.004
You chaps all right?

15:30.513 --> 15:33.767
What? That's... That's impossible.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.699
Some kind of door.

15:51.742 --> 15:53.619
Hello?

15:55.788 --> 15:57.711
Is there anyone there?

16:11.929 --> 16:16.150
There you are.
Nothing there. I told you so.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.943
And that's Coopers Field?

16:18.019 --> 16:20.989
As far as the eye can see,
and no falling star.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.782
Now, come on, I'm frozen to the bone.
Let's go.

16:23.858 --> 16:26.737
As your Mr Smith says, "Nothing to see."

16:34.577 --> 16:37.501
But I don't understand. Who are you?

16:37.580 --> 16:39.503
We are the Family.

16:39.582 --> 16:43.507
Far more important,
who are you, little thing?

16:43.586 --> 16:48.262
My name's Baines. Jeremy Baines.
Please, can I go?

16:48.382 --> 16:51.682
I'm so sorry, Baines,
Jeremy Baines,

16:51.761 --> 16:55.015
but! don't think you can ever leave.

16:55.097 --> 16:59.398
But who are you? Why can't I see you?

16:59.477 --> 17:01.946
Why would you want to see us?

17:03.272 --> 17:05.023
I want to know what you look like.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.734
Oh, that's easily answered

17:07.818 --> 17:11.867
because very soon,
we will look so familiar:

17:16.743 --> 17:20.123
Where is he? Promises a beer
and then vanishes into the night.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.636
There he is. Let him in.

17:37.557 --> 17:41.403
Well, Baines, you dolt. Thought you'd
been caught by the rozzers.

17:43.688 --> 17:44.985
Well, then?

17:45.064 --> 17:47.362
Where is it, man?
Where's the blessed beer?

17:47.441 --> 17:50.035
There was no beer. It was gone.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.284
Damn it all, I've been waiting.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.866
Pretty poor show, Baines, I have to say.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.315
What's the matter with you?
Caught the sniffles out there?

17:59.370 --> 18:02.214
Yes, I must have. It was cold.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.842
Very cold.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.593
Well, don't spread it about.
I don't want your germs.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.891
Come on, might as well get some sleep.

18:11.966 --> 18:16.187
Come on, chaps, maybe tomorrow.
Jackson's got some beer in the pavilion.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.573
Hello.

19:11.525 --> 19:13.402
Talking to a machine.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.463
Get down!

19:43.766 --> 19:46.064
Ah! They're following us.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.316
They can follow us wherever we go.

19:48.396 --> 19:51.445
Right across the universe.
They're never gonna stop.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.452
- Martha, you trust me, don't you?
- Of course I do.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.780
'Cause it all depends on you.

20:01.659 --> 20:05.289
Martha, this watch is me.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.377
Right, okay, gotcha.

20:07.456 --> 20:10.130
No! Hold on! Completely lost.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.052
Those creatures are hunters.
They can sniff out anyone.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.222
And me being a Time Lord,
well, I'm unique.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.640
They can track me down across
the whole of time and space.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.593
Huh. And the good news is?

20:18.676 --> 20:20.804
They can smell me, they haven't seen me,

20:20.886 --> 20:23.480
and their life supplies are running out,
so we hide.

20:23.639 --> 20:26.893
- Wait for them to die.
- But they can track us down.

20:26.976 --> 20:29.354
That's why I've got to do it.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.981
I have to stop being a Time Lord.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.363
I'm gonna become human.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.253
Never thought I'd use this.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.590
All the times I've wondered.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.673
- What does it do?
- Chameleon Arch.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.599
Rewrites my biology.

20:58.674 --> 21:01.974
It literally changes every single cell
in my body. I've set it to human.

21:02.052 --> 21:03.770
The Tardis will take care of everything.

21:03.846 --> 21:06.269
Invent a life story for me,
find me a setting and integrate.

21:06.348 --> 21:09.022
It can't do the same for you.
You’ll just have to improvise.

21:09.143 --> 21:11.521
I should have just enough
residual awareness to let you in.

21:11.604 --> 21:15.825
Hold on, if you're going to rewrite
every cell, isn't it going to hurt?

21:15.900 --> 21:18.403
Oh, yeah. It'll hurt.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.096
Is this working?

21:45.221 --> 21:47.019
Martha, before I change,

21:47.097 --> 21:49.395
here's a list of instructions
for when I'm human-

21:49.475 --> 21:51.603
One, don't let me hurt anyone.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.650
We can't have that, but you know what
humans are like.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.731
Two, don't worry about the Tardis.

21:55.815 --> 21:59.115
I'll put it on emergency power so they
can't detect it. just let it hide away.

21:59.193 --> 22:01.161
Four... No.

22:01.237 --> 22:05.083
Wait a minute. Three, no getting
involved in big historical events.

22:05.157 --> 22:08.252
Four, you. Don't let me abandon you.

22:09.203 --> 22:10.705
And five...

22:12.373 --> 22:16.549
But there was a meteor, a shooting
star, what am I supposed to do then?

22:16.627 --> 22:19.847
And 23, if anything goes wrong,

22:19.922 --> 22:22.675
if they find us, Martha,
then you know what to do.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.681
Open the watch.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.104
Everything I am is kept safe in there.

22:27.179 --> 22:30.399
I've put a perception filter on it so
the human me won't think anything of it.

22:30.474 --> 22:35.071
To him, it's just a watch.
But don't open it unless you have to.

22:35.145 --> 22:39.195
'Cause once it's open,
then the Family wit! be able to find me.

22:39.275 --> 22:42.404
It's all down to you, Martha.
Your choice.

22:44.238 --> 22:46.787
Oh! And thank you.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.126
I wish you'd come back.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.337
You told me to come
and collect that book, sir.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.047
Good lad, yes, yes!

23:02.047 --> 23:04.550
The Definitive Account of Mafeking
by Aitchinson Price.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.135
Where did I put it?

23:06.260 --> 23:10.015
And I wanted a little word.
Your marks aren't quite good enough.

23:10.097 --> 23:12.020
I'm top 10 in my class, sir.

23:12.141 --> 23:15.736
Now, be honest, Timothy.
You should be the very top.

23:15.811 --> 23:18.155
You're a clever boy.
You seem to be hiding it.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.073
Where is that book?

23:20.149 --> 23:24.996
And I know why. Keeping your head low
avoids the mockery of your classmates.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.328
But no man should hide himself,
don't you think?

23:28.449 --> 23:30.497
- Yes, sir.
- You're clever.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.291
Time Lord.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.497
You should be proud of it. Use it.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.125
Time Lord.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.421
Timothy, hide us.

23:41.503 --> 23:45.474
The secret lies within.
I'm trapped. I'm caged.

23:45.549 --> 23:48.223
Inside the cold, in the dark, waiting.

23:48.302 --> 23:52.102
- Reach out, boy. Reach out.
- Always waiting.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.268
Fascinating details about the siege,
really quite remarkable.

23:55.351 --> 23:58.321
- Are you all right?
- Yes, sir. Fine, sir.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.443
Right, then. Good.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.945
And remember, use that brain of yours.

24:03.025 --> 24:05.403
The power of a Time Lord.

24:08.030 --> 24:11.580
You're really not looking yourself,
old chap. Anything bothering you?

24:11.700 --> 24:14.203
No, sir. Thank you, sir.

24:34.223 --> 24:37.318
You are not alone.
Keep me hidden.

24:40.396 --> 24:43.900
Burn with the light.
Burn and turn!

24:51.740 --> 24:53.708
Now, boys, come along now.

24:54.535 --> 24:57.038
Classes are ready...

24:57.997 --> 24:59.874
Come along, Jenkins.

25:12.261 --> 25:15.265
There is a trace,
but somehow scattered.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.270
The scent is confused.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.774
Nave/Thates; we 'd best arm ourselves.

25:21.937 --> 25:23.564
Activate the soldiers.

25:40.247 --> 25:44.468
That is my property!
And you are trespassing on my land!

25:45.210 --> 25:46.587
Come on, who's in there?

25:46.670 --> 25:49.219
Is it one of those idiot boys
from the school, is it? Eh?

25:49.298 --> 25:50.971
Come on. I suppose...

25:53.969 --> 25:55.642
Well, how did you...

25:59.475 --> 26:02.149
No! No! Help me!

26:02.728 --> 26:04.196
Help me!

26:25.876 --> 26:27.799
Concentrate.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.182
Hutchinson, excellent work.

26:37.054 --> 26:40.183
- Cease fire!
- Good day to you, Headmaster.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.108
Your crew's on fine form today,
Mr Smith.

26:42.184 --> 26:44.312
Excuse me, Headmaster.
We could do a lot better.

26:44.394 --> 26:46.692
Latimer's being deliberately shoddy.

26:46.814 --> 26:49.237
- I'm trying my best.
- You need to be better than the best.

26:49.358 --> 26:52.077
Those targets are tribesmen
from the Dark Continent.

26:52.152 --> 26:55.622
That's exactly the problem, sir.
They only have spears.

26:55.697 --> 26:57.199
Oh, clear me.

26:57.282 --> 27:00.832
Latimer takes it upon himself
to make us realise how wrong we all are.

27:00.911 --> 27:02.538
I hope, Latimer, that one day

27:02.621 --> 27:06.216
you may have a just and proper war
in which to prove yourself.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.085
Now, resume firing.

27:15.592 --> 27:19.347
- Under the wire!
- Keep your heads down!

27:20.806 --> 27:24.401
One minute past the hour. It's now.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.943
Hutchinson, this is the time. It's now.

27:30.274 --> 27:32.527
Stoppage. Immediate action.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.613
Didn't I tell you, sir?
The stupid boy's useless.

27:35.737 --> 27:38.456
Permission to give Latimer
a beating, sir.

27:38.532 --> 27:40.955
- It's your class, Mr Smith.
- Permission granted.

27:41.034 --> 27:43.708
Right. Come with me, you little oik.

27:50.627 --> 27:52.675
Anything the matter, Baines?

27:52.754 --> 27:57.100
I thought... No, sir, nothing, sir.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.435
As you were, Mr Smith.

28:03.265 --> 28:07.065
Er, Pemberton, Smythe, Wicks, take post.

28:08.061 --> 28:09.153
Ah!

28:09.938 --> 28:11.565
Nurse Redfern.

28:11.648 --> 28:14.572
I'll give you back your journal
when next I see you.

28:14.651 --> 28:17.200
No, no, no, you don't have to.

28:17.279 --> 28:18.952
If you'll excuse me, Mr Smith,

28:19.031 --> 28:22.160
I was just thinking about the day
my husband was shot.

28:37.216 --> 28:40.891
His name was Oliver.
He died at the Battle of Spion Kop.

28:41.803 --> 28:44.147
We were childhood sweethearts.

28:45.307 --> 28:48.356
But, you see, I was angry
with the army for such a long time.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.403
And you still are.

28:50.479 --> 28:55.030
I find myself as part of that school,
watching boys learn how to kill.

28:55.108 --> 28:57.406
Don't you think discipline
is good for them?

28:57.486 --> 28:59.206
Does it have to be
such military discipline?

28:59.321 --> 29:02.245
If there's another war,
those boys won't find it so amusing.

29:02.324 --> 29:05.669
Well, Great Britain's at peace,
long may it reign.

29:07.329 --> 29:13.052
In your journal, in one of your stories,
you wrote about next year, 1914.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.133
It was just a dream.

29:15.212 --> 29:17.840
All those images of mud and wire.

29:18.632 --> 29:23.513
You told of a shadow. A shadow
falling across the entire world.

29:24.388 --> 29:27.392
Well, then, we can be thankful
it's not true.

29:27.474 --> 29:32.025
I'll admit, mankind doesn't need warfare
and bloodshed to prove itself.

29:32.145 --> 29:35.149
Everyday life can provide honour
and valour and...

29:35.232 --> 29:40.864
Let's hope that from now on this country
can find its heroes in smaller places.

29:45.659 --> 29:48.162
In the most

29:51.331 --> 29:53.379
ordinary of...

29:54.084 --> 29:55.882
Of deeds.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.539
Are you all right?

30:26.199 --> 30:29.419
- Lucky.
- That was luck?

30:30.287 --> 30:34.417
Miss Redfern, might I invite you
to the village dance this evening

30:34.499 --> 30:36.297
as my guest?

30:36.418 --> 30:38.967
You extraordinary man!

30:42.758 --> 30:47.104
Oh, it's all becoming clear now.
The Doctor is the man you'd like to be,

30:47.179 --> 30:49.307
doing impossible things
with cricket balls.

30:49.431 --> 30:51.934
Well, I discovered a talent,
that's certainly true.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.735
But the Doctor
has an eye for the ladies.

30:53.810 --> 30:56.154
- The devil!
- A girl at every fireplace.

30:56.229 --> 31:00.359
Ah! Now, there I have to protest, Joan.
That is hardly me.

31:00.942 --> 31:03.821
Says the man dancing with me tonight.

31:03.945 --> 31:06.073
That scarecrow's all askew.

31:11.620 --> 31:14.669
Ever the artist.
Where did you learn to draw?

31:14.790 --> 31:17.009
- Gallifrey.
- Is that in Ireland?

31:18.752 --> 31:21.175
- Yes, it must be.
- You're not Irish.

31:21.296 --> 31:25.927
Not at all, no. My father, Sidney,
was a watchmaker from Nottingham

31:26.968 --> 31:29.312
and my mother, Verity, was...

31:31.431 --> 31:33.650
- Well, she was a nurse, actually.
- Oh?

31:33.725 --> 31:37.104
- We make such good wives.
- Really? Right.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.322
Yes.

31:40.649 --> 31:42.697
Well, my work is done,
what do you think?

31:42.776 --> 31:44.574
Masterpiece.

31:44.653 --> 31:46.826
All sorts of skills today.

32:00.836 --> 32:02.429
Can I see?

32:08.176 --> 32:11.396
Oh, goodness. Do I look like that?

32:12.097 --> 32:13.849
Are you sure that's not me?

32:14.015 --> 32:16.609
No, it's certainly this page.
You like it?

32:16.726 --> 32:20.822
- You've made me far too beautiful.
- Well, that's how I see you.

32:22.357 --> 32:24.030
Widows aren't supposed to be beautiful.

32:24.109 --> 32:27.033
I think the world
would rather we stopped.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.574
Is that fair?

32:31.700 --> 32:33.202
That we stop?

32:35.412 --> 32:37.540
That's not fair at all.

32:55.098 --> 32:57.066
I've never, um...

33:06.234 --> 33:09.579
Martha, what have I told you
about entering unannounced?

33:12.324 --> 33:14.076
Wasn't on the list.

33:21.958 --> 33:25.508
Four, you. Don't let me abandon you.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.760
That's no good.

33:27.839 --> 33:31.093
What about the stuff you didn't tell me?
What about women?

33:31.301 --> 33:34.305
Oh, no, you didn't think of that.

33:34.387 --> 33:37.186
What the hell am I supposed to do, then?

33:37.265 --> 33:38.892
Thank you.

33:41.269 --> 33:43.363
You had to, didn't you?

33:44.105 --> 33:47.200
You had to go and
fall in love with a human.

33:48.068 --> 33:50.036
And it wasn't me.

33:51.988 --> 33:53.114
The darkness is coming.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.542
Keep me away
from the false and empty man.

33:55.617 --> 34:00.999
The last of the Time Lords,
the last of that wise and ancient race-

34:36.449 --> 34:40.795
Who's that playing silly beggars?
Nearly broke me neck.

34:40.870 --> 34:43.498
Who's that, then? Is that you, Saul?

34:56.678 --> 34:58.305
I don't understand.

34:59.723 --> 35:01.725
It's Mr Clark, isn't it?

35:02.684 --> 35:05.062
What have I done wrong?

35:07.856 --> 35:10.109
Nothing at all.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.909
In fact,

35:12.986 --> 35:15.034
you're just what we need, girl.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.161
She works at the school.

35:18.491 --> 35:22.291
And whatever's happening seems to be
centred around that establishment.

35:22.370 --> 35:26.250
The faintest of traces,
but they all lead back there.

35:26.875 --> 35:28.593
It's Baines, isn't it?

35:30.045 --> 35:31.547
This isn't very funny, sir.

35:31.671 --> 35:35.426
Just shut up, stop talking,
cease and desist. There's a good girl!

35:36.217 --> 35:39.517
Mother of mine is dying to meet you.

35:41.723 --> 35:43.191
And here she is.

35:46.436 --> 35:49.110
- Stop mocking me, sir!
- No!

35:49.564 --> 35:52.943
Mother of mine just needs a shape.

35:53.068 --> 35:55.617
We go through shapes so very fast.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.741
Yours is perfectly adequate.

35:59.741 --> 36:01.539
If a little grim.

36:03.328 --> 36:04.921
Mother of mine,

36:05.914 --> 36:07.757
embrace her.

36:15.423 --> 36:17.266
You look wonderful.

36:17.342 --> 36:21.347
You'd best give me some warning.
Um... Can you actually dance?

36:22.764 --> 36:25.768
Urn... I'm not certain.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.649
There's a surprise.

36:28.728 --> 36:31.197
Is there anything you're certain about?

36:31.272 --> 36:33.149
Yes. Yes.

36:38.613 --> 36:41.116
There you are. Come look what I've got.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.294
Mr Pool didn't want his afternoon tea,
so cook said I could have it.

36:44.452 --> 36:47.922
And there's enough for two.
What are you standing there for?

36:50.458 --> 36:53.803
- Are you all right?
- I must have a cold coming on.

36:55.130 --> 36:58.054
Problem is, I keep thinking about them,
but I don't know what to do.

36:58.133 --> 37:01.103
- Thinking about who?
- Mr Smith and Matron,

37:01.177 --> 37:04.772
'cause it's never gonna last,
he's gonna leave in a few weeks.

37:04.848 --> 37:06.145
Why?

37:06.224 --> 37:09.273
It's like his contract comes to an end
and she's going to be heartbroken.

37:09.352 --> 37:12.322
- Leave for where?
- All sorts of places.

37:12.981 --> 37:16.451
Oh, I wish I could tell you, jenny,
but it's complicated.

37:16.526 --> 37:18.870
- In what way?
- I just can't.

37:19.904 --> 37:23.158
It sounds so interesting.
Tell me. Tell me now.

37:27.662 --> 37:30.290
- Would you like some tea?
- Yes, thanks.

37:30.373 --> 37:34.503
I could put a nice bit of gravy
in the pot and some mutton.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.509
Or sardines and jam, how about that?

37:38.381 --> 37:40.099
I like the sound of that.

37:40.216 --> 37:43.186
Right. Hold on a tick.

38:06.659 --> 38:08.377
- They've found us!
- This is ridiculous.

38:08.495 --> 38:11.089
- Martha, I've warned you.
- They've found us and I've seen them!

38:11.206 --> 38:13.334
They look like people, like us,
like normal.

38:13.416 --> 38:16.090
I'm sorry, but you've got
to open the watch.

38:18.171 --> 38:19.923
Where is it?

38:20.715 --> 38:22.556
Oh, my God! Where's it gone?
Where's the watch?

38:22.592 --> 38:23.718
What are you talking about?

38:23.843 --> 38:26.642
You had a watch,
a fob watch, right there.

38:26.721 --> 38:27.938
Did I? I don't remember.

38:28.056 --> 38:30.400
I can't think
what concern it is of yours.

38:30.517 --> 38:32.235
But we need it. Oh, my God, Doctor.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.859
We're hiding from aliens
and they've got jenny

38:34.938 --> 38:37.566
and they've possessed her
or copied her or something,

38:37.690 --> 38:39.158
and you've got to tell me,
where's the watch?

38:39.234 --> 38:40.952
Oh, I see.

38:41.903 --> 38:43.746
Cultural differences.

38:45.114 --> 38:47.708
It must be so confusing for you.

38:47.784 --> 38:50.958
Martha, this is what we call a story.

38:51.913 --> 38:54.291
Oh, you complete...

38:54.415 --> 38:58.215
This is not you. This is 1913.

38:58.461 --> 39:00.304
Good. This is 1913.

39:00.380 --> 39:03.759
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry,
but I've got to snap you out of this.

39:03.883 --> 39:05.009
Martha!

39:05.093 --> 39:07.437
Wake up! You're coming back
to the Tardis with me.

39:07.512 --> 39:10.391
How dare you! I'm not going anywhere
with an insane servant.

39:10.473 --> 39:13.067
Martha, you are dismissed. You will
leave these premises immediately.

39:13.142 --> 39:14.860
Now, get out!

39:15.436 --> 39:17.905
The nerve of it! The absolute cheek!

39:17.981 --> 39:19.699
You think I'm a fantasist,
what about her?

39:19.774 --> 39:22.118
The funny thing is,
you did have a fob watch.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.616
Right there. Don't you remember?

39:28.199 --> 39:29.451
Oh! Sorry!

39:30.660 --> 39:32.162
Sorry!

39:32.287 --> 39:33.789
Martha?

39:33.913 --> 39:35.881
Not now, Tim, I'm busy!

39:49.971 --> 39:51.723
Mr Smith?

39:53.308 --> 39:54.776
No one home.

39:55.518 --> 39:58.192
The maid
was definitely hiding something.

39:58.271 --> 40:00.649
A secret around this Mr Smith.

40:00.773 --> 40:04.448
We both scented him, though,
he was plain and simply human.

40:04.527 --> 40:06.825
But maybe he knows something.

40:07.864 --> 40:09.537
Where is he?

40:10.992 --> 40:13.836
She's infatuated.
You're a dangerous man.

40:13.953 --> 40:17.002
- You've taken my arm in public.
- I'm very scared.

40:17.123 --> 40:19.797
Spare a penny
for the veterans of the Crimea, sir?

40:19.876 --> 40:23.096
Yes, of course. There you are, then.

40:34.682 --> 40:40.189
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your partners for a waltz.

40:53.242 --> 40:56.246
- You can dance.
- Quite surprised myself.

40:57.455 --> 41:00.550
Oh, I say! Sorry.

41:10.218 --> 41:12.016
I think this might help.

41:14.222 --> 41:16.475
That makes it easy, Son of mine,

41:16.557 --> 41:19.106
because Daughter of mine's
already there.

41:19.227 --> 41:21.025
We've been invited to the dance.

41:28.069 --> 41:31.118
Oh, staff entrance I think, miss.

41:31.239 --> 41:33.287
Yeah, well, think again, mate.

41:51.217 --> 41:53.640
Please don't. Not again.

41:53.720 --> 41:57.270
He's different from any other man
you've ever met, right?

41:57.390 --> 41:58.516
Yes.

41:58.599 --> 42:01.022
And sometimes he says
these strange things,

42:01.102 --> 42:04.026
like people and places
you've never heard of, yeah?

42:04.105 --> 42:05.903
But it's deeper than that.

42:05.982 --> 42:08.781
Sometimes when
you look in his eyes, you know,

42:08.860 --> 42:12.080
you just know
that there's something else in there.

42:12.155 --> 42:13.873
Something hidden.

42:14.615 --> 42:17.243
Right behind the eyes,
something hidden away.

42:17.326 --> 42:20.580
- In the dark.
- I don't know what you mean.

42:21.372 --> 42:22.840
Yes, you do.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.299
I don't mean to be rude,

42:27.462 --> 42:31.057
but the awful thing is
it doesn't even matter what you think.

42:31.132 --> 42:33.806
But you're nice and you're lucky.

42:33.968 --> 42:36.721
And I just wanted to say sorry
for what I'm about to do.

42:36.804 --> 42:40.104
Oh, now, really, Martha,
this is getting out of hand.

42:40.183 --> 42:42.652
I must insist that you leave.

42:42.727 --> 42:44.445
Do you know what this is?

42:45.563 --> 42:46.940
Name it.

42:47.023 --> 42:48.991
Go on, name it.

42:49.734 --> 42:51.907
John, what is that silly thing?

42:51.986 --> 42:53.238
John?

43:01.829 --> 43:03.706
You're not John Smith.

43:04.540 --> 43:06.668
You're called the Doctor.

43:07.251 --> 43:09.845
The man in your journal, he's real.

43:10.463 --> 43:11.806
He's you.

43:14.217 --> 43:17.221
Evening, all! Spare a penny, sir?

43:17.512 --> 43:19.310
I didn't spare you.

43:40.701 --> 43:43.830
You will be silent!

43:44.330 --> 43:46.173
All of you!

43:46.582 --> 43:48.550
I said, silent!

43:48.626 --> 43:51.129
Mr Clark, what's going on?

43:55.883 --> 43:58.261
Mr Smith, everything I told you,
just forget it.

43:58.344 --> 43:59.516
Don't say anything-

43:59.595 --> 44:01.893
We asked for silence!

44:04.600 --> 44:06.022
Now then,

44:06.936 --> 44:09.985
we have a few questions for Mr Smith.

44:10.064 --> 44:13.113
No, better than that.

44:13.192 --> 44:15.536
The teacher, he's the Doctor.

44:16.195 --> 44:17.993
I heard them talking.

44:18.072 --> 44:20.291
You took human form.

44:20.366 --> 44:23.461
Of course I'm human!
I was born human, as were you, Baines!

44:23.536 --> 44:25.664
And jenny and you, Mr Clark.

44:25.746 --> 44:28.340
What is going on? This is madness!

44:28.416 --> 44:32.842
Ooh, and a human brain, too.
Simple, thick and dull.

44:33.171 --> 44:35.344
But he's no good like this.

44:35.423 --> 44:37.642
We need a Time Lord.

44:37.758 --> 44:39.226
Easily done.

44:43.764 --> 44:45.983
- Change back.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

44:46.100 --> 44:47.443
Change back!

44:47.560 --> 44:50.154
I literally do not know...

44:50.438 --> 44:53.317
- Get off me!
- She's your friend, isn't she?

44:53.441 --> 44:55.944
Doesn't this scare you enough
to change back?

44:56.027 --> 44:59.201
- I don't know what you mean!
- Wait a minute.

44:59.280 --> 45:03.001
The maid told me about
Smith and the matron.

45:03.117 --> 45:05.666
- That woman, there.
- Then let's have you!

45:09.790 --> 45:12.669
Have you enjoyed it, Doctor?
Being human?

45:12.793 --> 45:17.014
Has it taught you wonderful things?
Are you better, richer, wiser?

45:17.673 --> 45:20.096
Then let's see you answer this.

45:20.176 --> 45:23.055
Which one of them
do you want us to kill?

45:24.388 --> 45:26.015
Maid or matron?

45:26.807 --> 45:28.650
Your friend

45:28.726 --> 45:30.399
or your lover?

45:31.145 --> 45:32.818
Your choice.

46:29.370 --> 46:31.213
We are the Family of Blood.

46:39.422 --> 46:40.799
Save us.

46:40.881 --> 46:42.633
I am not the Doctor.

46:42.717 --> 46:45.846
He 3 like the night
and the storm and the heart of the sun.

46:45.928 --> 46:47.271
He's ancient and forever.

46:47.388 --> 46:50.858
He burns at the centre of time
and he can see the turn of the universe.
