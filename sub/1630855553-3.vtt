WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.926
<i>And we're expecting another 6 inches of
rainfall by dusk.</i>

00:08.926 --> 00:12.095
<i>A flood warning is in effect
as far south as Baltimore.</i>

00:12.095 --> 00:15.349
<i>Folks are encouraged
to stay off the roads, if at all possible.</i>

00:15.349 --> 00:17.893
<i>Our crew witnessed several wrecks
on the interstate,</i>

00:17.893 --> 00:19.686
<i>one a youth church van.</i>

00:20.312 --> 00:21.605
<i>Prayers to their families.</i>

00:22.731 --> 00:25.234
<i>Gosh. Stay safe, Ed.</i>

00:26.443 --> 00:29.530
<i>And now let's kick it over
to sunny San Diego,</i>

00:29.530 --> 00:32.824
<i>where our fitness expert,
Sheila D. Rubin, is standing by.</i>

00:37.162 --> 00:40.624
See? It's not hard. It's challenging.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.460
- Know the difference?
- You bet.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.255
- Do you really, Stew?
- I do not.

00:46.255 --> 00:49.091
Hard is the voice in your head
that says that you can't,

00:49.967 --> 00:51.844
that you've tried before,
and you've failed before.

00:51.844 --> 00:54.680
That you're weak.
And you're the last one to know it.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.682
Sounds like you've been
talking to my mother-in-law.

00:57.349 --> 00:58.433
I kid.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.769
A challenge is what's left
when you kill that voice.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.480
It's a burning in your thighs
that says that you can,

01:04.982 --> 01:05.983
that you're strong.

01:07.693 --> 01:10.529
So that clicking in my knee,
that's a challenge?

01:10.529 --> 01:12.614
No, Stew. That's osteoarthritis.

01:13.115 --> 01:16.410
But we can work with that.
I'll show you some modifications.

01:16.910 --> 01:21.957
For four, three, two, one. Come on.

01:22.541 --> 01:26.044
Walk, walk, pivot. Walk, walk, pivot.
You've got it.

01:26.587 --> 01:27.629
And we're out!

01:29.965 --> 01:31.049
Thanks, ladies.

01:31.049 --> 01:33.260
- Okay.
- Excuse me. Sorry.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.012
- Pardon me. This is me. Hi.
- Thank you.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.472
You are stunning. You are a star.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.308
You're in orbit.
I actually feel light-headed.

01:39.308 --> 01:41.185
Take it easy. Just the first day at work.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.228
No, that was just broadcasted

01:43.228 --> 01:45.772
to every kitchen and living room
in America.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.609
I'm talking about New York, DC,
Jacksonville, Topeka.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.278
Why am I naming cities?
You know what America is.

02:09.880 --> 02:13.634
So, you're terrific, quite obviously.
You don't need me to tell you that,

02:13.634 --> 02:15.010
so I'll cut right to it.

02:15.010 --> 02:19.223
What we're proposing is that
we marry your national brand to ours.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.016
Regional brand.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.976
You were picked up by
<i>Good Morning America</i>.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.312
- I'd say you're national.
- I meant you.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.981
Hartman Foods doesn't have a footprint
in the Southwest yet,

02:27.981 --> 02:30.442
- according to our research.
- Or the Pacific Northwest.

02:31.026 --> 02:31.860
Well--

02:31.860 --> 02:35.030
So it's us that would be launching you
into the world. Isn't that right?

02:35.781 --> 02:38.742
Let me jump in
before these ladies eat you whole, Mason.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.788
We're not in all markets yet,
but we want you to help us get there.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.293
Every woman wants to be Sheila Rubin,

02:48.293 --> 02:49.586
but they wonder,

02:49.586 --> 02:53.215
"What would I have to sacrifice?
Pleasure? Happiness?"

02:53.715 --> 02:54.716
Not anymore.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.011
Meet our new product: a fat-free cookie.

02:58.595 --> 03:02.391
No fat in the cookie, no fat on you.
It's scientifically proven.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.726
We'll hammer out
the specifics in a formal offer,

03:04.726 --> 03:07.187
but we're thinking
a sizable up-front payment,

03:07.187 --> 03:08.814
plus profit participation.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.358
Every time a consumer
takes a bite of a cookie,

03:11.358 --> 03:14.278
you get a bite of the cookie.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.113
But first, the fun stuff.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.156
We wanna know your likes and dislikes.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.117
What's your favorite flavor
of cookie, Sheila?

03:20.117 --> 03:21.743
We've got a lot to choose from.

03:22.369 --> 03:25.664
This cookie has to really say "you."

03:28.667 --> 03:32.838
We are gonna want
some time with these cookies,

03:32.838 --> 03:33.755
if you don't mind.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.300
So we would like to take some samples home

03:36.300 --> 03:39.636
and get right back to ya
with our thoughts.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.849
And everyone's talking
like it's no big deal

03:43.849 --> 03:48.645
there's a tray of hot cookies on the table
and, for me, it's all I see.

03:49.313 --> 03:50.939
I mean, it's like...

03:52.900 --> 03:53.901
You know what it's like?

03:53.901 --> 03:56.528
It's like there's a strobe light
just flashing,

03:56.528 --> 03:58.238
and I'm supposed to just ignore it.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.698
How is that even possible?

04:00.199 --> 04:03.368
Or it's like there's naked people
having actual sex in the room,

04:03.368 --> 04:05.245
and everyone else is pretending
like it's normal,

04:05.245 --> 04:06.914
having a normal conversation and--

04:07.956 --> 04:09.416
I can't.

04:10.417 --> 04:13.170
They kept asking me
what my favorite flavor of cookie was,

04:13.170 --> 04:15.631
and you know what's crazy? I don't know.

04:16.130 --> 04:17.757
I don't know. I really don't.

04:18.425 --> 04:22.012
I thought I was just
put on the spot or frozen,

04:22.012 --> 04:25.724
but I kept thinking about it
and just kept coming up empty.

04:26.225 --> 04:29.269
Yeah. Funny thing happens
when you spend your whole adult life

04:29.269 --> 04:31.772
just denying anything you want.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.692
You lose touch with yourself. You know?

04:35.692 --> 04:37.027
That's it. Yeah.

04:38.695 --> 04:39.696
I don't know.

04:40.864 --> 04:45.786
I don't know what I like.
That's such a humiliating thing to admit.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.706
Anywhere but here.

04:52.209 --> 04:54.294
My therapist told me
to take myself to dinner.

04:55.796 --> 05:00.050
Try new things, give myself room
to develop likes and dislikes.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.053
- How did it go?
- I didn't do it.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.264
Eat dinner alone in a restaurant

05:05.264 --> 05:08.141
with everyone looking at me?
I'd be mortified.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.147
Okay. What do we have here?

05:14.648 --> 05:16.024
Hey, how do I know you?

05:16.942 --> 05:20.153
The post office. Yes.
Two weeks ago you sold me stamps.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.864
Yeah, that's right.

05:21.864 --> 05:24.825
- I do not forget a face.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

05:24.825 --> 05:26.410
What am I doing here?

05:27.411 --> 05:28.662
What are you doing here?

05:29.746 --> 05:31.331
You in some kind of a cult now?

05:31.832 --> 05:34.751
This is my support group.
My anonymous support group.

05:36.795 --> 05:39.006
I'm-- Well, I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

05:39.006 --> 05:42.759
I just-- I went out for a quick jog
to clear my head,

05:42.759 --> 05:45.554
something I do quite a bit now.

05:45.554 --> 05:47.139
It's pretty incredible.
It's life-changing.

05:47.139 --> 05:49.933
It's actually very--
It's very me-changing.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.686
Yeah, I just kept jogging,
and I ended up here,

05:52.686 --> 05:54.104
and I will get out of your hair.

05:54.104 --> 05:57.357
I just wanted to see if you could maybe
pick Maya up a day early.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.735
My coworkers keep
asking me out for drinks,

05:59.735 --> 06:02.529
and if I keep saying no,
I'm in danger of being the old guy.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.948
You gotta be kidding me, Danny.
I need more notice.

06:05.699 --> 06:09.870
Well, Sheila, I could ask someone
at the village, if you want,

06:09.870 --> 06:11.955
but those girls party.
By the end of the night,

06:11.955 --> 06:14.374
our daughter's gonna be drinking
out of a salt-rimmed glass.

06:16.418 --> 06:17.878
You don't live here anymore.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.507
You need to call first. Or at least knock.

06:26.470 --> 06:27.471
Right.

06:32.226 --> 06:34.811
Your ex is a real piece of work, huh?

06:35.479 --> 06:38.857
I think Marsha's
gonna turtle for the next year and a half.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.984
I'm sorry. It will not happen again.

06:41.735 --> 06:45.072
Well, I mean, one way to make sure
it never happens again

06:45.072 --> 06:48.116
is for us to get a real space
for these meetings, huh?

06:48.116 --> 06:51.787
Hey, I think it's working quite well here.
I mean, I'm happy hosting.

06:52.454 --> 06:53.872
I'm sure you are.

06:53.872 --> 06:56.875
But did you ever consider
us hiding out in your garage

06:56.875 --> 06:58.752
isn't exactly the best road to recovery?

06:58.752 --> 07:01.547
I don't think a little privacy
is compromising my recovery.

07:02.798 --> 07:06.009
What about ours? We're not on TV.

07:06.009 --> 07:09.888
We're just regular people who've worked
really hard to get this far,

07:09.888 --> 07:14.476
and feeling like we're your secret
just doesn't feel that great, Sheil.

07:14.476 --> 07:15.853
- I mean--
- I'm not hiding out.

07:15.853 --> 07:18.105
I just have a lot of complications
in my life right now.

07:18.105 --> 07:22.109
- You know, childcare for one.
- You're the only one with kids?

07:23.110 --> 07:25.153
I don't think so. People work it out.

07:26.864 --> 07:30.075
I will make sure there are
no more interruptions. It's a promise.

07:54.850 --> 07:56.310
Like what you see?

07:57.811 --> 07:58.937
How could I not?

08:00.397 --> 08:02.858
Such a classy photo,
you lying there spread-eagle.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.904
That's right.
You don't know what you like.

08:07.905 --> 08:09.990
Ladies, gentlemen, chocolate, vanilla.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.952
Bless your little heart.
I never had that problem.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.120
I imagine you haven't.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.414
I know what I want
and I know how to get it.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.542
- I even know what you want.
- And what's that?

08:20.542 --> 08:25.214
Right now, more than anything,
you want to fuck Danny over.

08:25.214 --> 08:29.259
No. Danny's already a mess.
He'll derail himself eventually.

08:29.259 --> 08:33.013
Okay. You could wait for him
to self-destruct, maybe,

08:33.013 --> 08:35.933
and in the meantime,
he casually invades your life,

08:35.933 --> 08:37.851
your recovery, your business,

08:37.851 --> 08:40.645
and he changes your
custody arrangement on a whim.

08:40.645 --> 08:44.691
But what's one more day of childcare after
six years of raising a kid by yourself

08:44.691 --> 08:47.444
while Danny pretends his life's
more important than yours?

08:48.320 --> 08:49.988
Sounds like he has you convinced.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.699
It's just who he is,

08:53.784 --> 08:56.328
who he's been allowed to be
by everyone. By me.

08:56.328 --> 08:59.873
So now it's your fault
that he's a lazy, selfish son of a bitch.

09:00.624 --> 09:01.834
That's rich.

09:01.834 --> 09:03.627
You should go on the road
with that routine.

09:03.627 --> 09:06.421
Speaking of the road,
aren't you late picking up Maya?

09:14.263 --> 09:15.264
Is this your car?

09:17.099 --> 09:19.184
It was our car, mine and Danny's.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.480
Okay, listen carefully.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.901
Convertible, German, bucket seats.

09:28.485 --> 09:31.488
You're on television now.
Have some self-respect.

09:47.379 --> 09:50.299
Great, you're here.
I'll go get Maya and tell her--

09:51.967 --> 09:53.677
Could we have a word outside, please?

09:55.304 --> 09:56.305
Yeah.

10:01.894 --> 10:04.771
Okay, so, what's this all about?

10:05.772 --> 10:08.567
You now have
50/50 custody of our daughter.

10:10.068 --> 10:12.112
I don't remember my lawyer
saying anything about that.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.573
No lawyers, no discussion,
just compliance.

10:16.533 --> 10:17.868
Okay. I get it.

10:18.368 --> 10:23.123
You want me outta your hair,
because how dare I swing by the house

10:23.123 --> 10:25.459
- that we co-own or participate...
- Danny.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.920
- ...in the business that we co-own?
- I think you should stop.

10:27.920 --> 10:31.298
So you use our daughter to clip my wings.
Jesus Christ.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.718
Every time I think you have hit
your moral bottom,

10:34.718 --> 10:36.553
you somehow manage to sink even lower.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.639
Funny you should mention morality.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.057
Remember that college protest

10:40.057 --> 10:42.184
when you threw a brick through
the courthouse window

10:42.184 --> 10:44.937
- and spent two nights in jail?
- You think I'm ashamed of that?

10:44.937 --> 10:46.897
No,
I'm sure you're quite proud of yourself.

10:46.897 --> 10:50.234
But it does beg the question, Danny,
why was it only two nights?

10:50.234 --> 10:51.193
Last time I checked,

10:51.193 --> 10:53.904
damaging federal property
carried a sentence of up to ten years.

10:53.904 --> 10:54.988
So you're a lawyer now?

10:54.988 --> 10:58.450
Doesn't take a lawyer to figure out when
someone's cooperated with the authorities.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.079
Is that what happened?

11:02.079 --> 11:04.498
You just gave the cops some names and--

11:05.249 --> 11:08.001
I wonder what Jack and Jerry
would think of that.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.712
I wonder what all your new colleagues
would think of that.

11:11.630 --> 11:12.714
What happened to you?

11:13.715 --> 11:15.634
You do one segment on the news,
and you're suddenly--

11:15.634 --> 11:19.930
This is who I've always been, Danny.
I just never let you see it before.

11:34.695 --> 11:38.448
- It doesn't fit.
- I'm sure with a little effort.

11:39.449 --> 11:42.035
Look at me. I'm not up for this.

11:43.287 --> 11:44.371
Of course you are.

11:45.539 --> 11:48.292
It's just been a while since you...

11:48.792 --> 11:49.918
Left the house?

11:52.045 --> 11:55.465
I understand your trepidation,
but this dinner is important.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.051
These people are important,

11:58.051 --> 12:00.554
and they need to know
that we are important too.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.807
Why do you need these people to know
that you're important?

12:04.558 --> 12:07.519
They don't see us. They don't respect us.

12:08.103 --> 12:12.774
Their bigotry about our faith is something
they will have to reconcile with the Lord.

12:17.321 --> 12:20.073
But you know what the Games mean to me.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.411
Have meant to me since I was a boy,
watching with my father.

12:25.579 --> 12:29.917
Greatness achieved through discipline
and purity of mind.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.961
And to play some small part in that...

12:40.427 --> 12:42.554
They installed cameras today
in the neighborhood,

12:43.430 --> 12:45.682
on every light post, to catch the vandal.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.855
We're being watched now, at all times.

12:55.526 --> 12:58.028
How we handle that will chart our course.

13:14.503 --> 13:17.214
Can I get you something
to drink while you wait for your date?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.299
I'm not waiting.

13:19.299 --> 13:22.469
I'm dining by myself this evening.

13:23.679 --> 13:24.763
Even better.

13:29.643 --> 13:30.644
Wait a second.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.815
Did you go to MiraCosta
Community College for a few months?

13:34.815 --> 13:38.151
Like-- You look so familiar.

13:39.361 --> 13:40.737
I didn't.

13:41.238 --> 13:44.116
I would love
a glass of white wine, please.

13:45.951 --> 13:48.871
I used to get that all the time
when I first showed up on TV.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.206
"Did you grow up in Tampa?"

13:51.915 --> 13:53.750
Do I look like I grew up in Tampa?

13:54.918 --> 13:57.129
Then again, maybe I do.

13:59.423 --> 14:02.551
- Get a chance to decide?
- Oh, yes. Let me see here.

14:07.598 --> 14:10.100
- Do you need another minute?
- No, I'm almost--

14:10.809 --> 14:12.102
Is it really this hard?

14:12.769 --> 14:15.606
This life-or-death,
just to pick a goddamn entrée?

14:16.940 --> 14:18.609
I guess so. You know what?

14:18.609 --> 14:21.195
Maybe that crappy little car
is just right for you.

14:21.195 --> 14:22.613
Do you have any lighter fare?

14:22.613 --> 14:25.282
Everything here seems to
come with a sauce or--

14:25.282 --> 14:26.617
Yeah, that's kinda his thing.

14:27.201 --> 14:32.206
I'm not really a food guy per se,
but people seem to dig the surf and turf.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.750
I don't usually eat shellfish.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.545
Oh, my God, that's it!

14:38.545 --> 14:40.005
You were on the news.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.715
The leotard lady.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.427
Oh, my God, you didn't go to MiraCosta.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.930
- And now they'll all watch you...
- You'd never go there.

14:47.930 --> 14:50.557
- I was thinking, "Maybe she"--
- ...sucking a lobster tail,

14:51.141 --> 14:55.229
that purple vein
filled with God knows what.

14:55.812 --> 14:58.565
You know what? I think I do need
a few more minutes to decide.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.650
Thank you so much.

15:02.694 --> 15:05.739
So, John, you're a mall man.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.742
I develop commercial real estate,

15:08.742 --> 15:12.120
so malls are a large part of my book.

15:13.038 --> 15:14.206
Well, that's big business.

15:15.249 --> 15:16.750
We've been happy with our growth.

15:18.252 --> 15:20.128
No one happier than the missus, I'm sure.

15:20.712 --> 15:21.797
Shop, shop, shop.

15:24.675 --> 15:27.469
Maria, Heath was speaking to you.

15:27.469 --> 15:30.055
I believe he was speaking about me.

15:33.517 --> 15:34.518
Right.

15:34.518 --> 15:38.939
It is a miracle when there's enough room
in the car for me and her bags.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.527
- Can I top you off?
- We don't drink alcohol. Thank you.

15:44.486 --> 15:47.447
You can partake in a little
merriment with us, can't you?

15:48.115 --> 15:51.159
- God will understand.
- Fucking bitch.

15:51.159 --> 15:52.953
This fucking bitch will put a steak knife

15:52.953 --> 15:56.248
in your neck
if you ever talk like that again.

16:02.296 --> 16:04.798
That seemed spicy. What'd you say?

16:12.973 --> 16:14.391
I know what you're going through.

16:15.350 --> 16:16.602
I don't think you do.

16:17.728 --> 16:20.272
Picking off that menu, it's impossible.

16:21.190 --> 16:25.319
Does the fact that I am
sitting here by myself,

16:25.319 --> 16:31.408
and that I'm a woman, just entitle you
to walk up and talk to me?

16:32.701 --> 16:36.205
I mean, if I was a businessman by myself,
would you do the same thing?

16:37.331 --> 16:38.665
Probably not. Although--

16:38.665 --> 16:40.000
- Maybe. Depends.
- Okay.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.794
- Can I get the check, please?
- Oh, no, no. Hold on.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.922
- Before you go, let me apologize.
- Please.

16:44.922 --> 16:48.467
Not for talking to you,
because that's just normal human behavior.

16:48.467 --> 16:49.760
It's more for this.

16:50.302 --> 16:52.471
Why do I bother bringing you
the best produce in the country

16:52.471 --> 16:54.181
if you don't want people to taste it?

16:54.181 --> 16:57.392
Dumping all this butter
on this beautiful asparagus, you know?

16:57.392 --> 17:02.022
And don't let me get started on the pesto,
because the pesto is a crime.

17:03.106 --> 17:07.736
I'm Carlos, by the way.
Look, I don't mean to impose--

17:07.736 --> 17:09.112
I think it's a bit late for that.

17:09.112 --> 17:13.075
No, but it would kill me
if you came all this way...

17:13.075 --> 17:15.117
- I live very close by.
- ...and you paid all this money...

17:15.117 --> 17:16.537
No, and I haven't ordered anything

17:16.537 --> 17:17.579
- off the menu.
- ...and you don't try

17:17.579 --> 17:20.665
- the very best thing in the restaurant.
- I don't wanna try anything else.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.835
- I'm fine. Thank you.
- No. You must.

17:22.835 --> 17:24.294
Please, put that down.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.508
Take this.

17:31.134 --> 17:32.135
Now...

17:35.430 --> 17:36.265
Voilà.

17:48.652 --> 17:51.363
It's an Azoychka.
Not an uncommon cultivar.

17:51.363 --> 17:53.991
That tastes like--
I mean, it reminds me of--

17:55.534 --> 17:57.160
It reminds me of summer.

17:58.036 --> 18:00.414
- When I was a kid.
- Yes.

18:00.414 --> 18:02.499
That may be the best tomato
I've ever tasted.

18:02.499 --> 18:05.252
Or maybe the only tomato I've ever tasted.

18:05.252 --> 18:10.966
And now, sadly,
all food will be ruined for you forever.

18:11.550 --> 18:12.801
Consider me ruined.

18:14.219 --> 18:17.139
Listen, thank you for indulging me.

18:17.139 --> 18:20.809
And, enjoy the rest of your tomato

18:20.809 --> 18:23.312
and your night. I will...

18:23.312 --> 18:25.314
- Where did you come from?
- Me?

18:26.273 --> 18:27.441
Oh, yeah. The tomato.

18:27.441 --> 18:28.692
Yeah.

18:28.692 --> 18:32.404
They grow them on a small family farm
outside of Lodi.

18:32.404 --> 18:33.864
Well, they must be magicians.

18:33.864 --> 18:36.116
- No. You could grow these.
- Not a chance.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.744
I have a black thumb.
I kill artificial plants.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.495
That cannot be true.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.832
- How would you know?
- I don't.

18:43.832 --> 18:47.336
I just have a hunch that you don't
give yourself enough credit.

18:48.795 --> 18:52.049
And to tell the truth, I don't have
the best luck in the garden either,

18:52.049 --> 18:54.843
but I know what to buy
and I know how to sell it

18:54.843 --> 18:57.387
at a handsome markup
to joints like this one.

18:57.387 --> 19:00.432
So they can murder it
with butter and garlic?

19:00.933 --> 19:02.643
Yes. Exactly.

19:02.643 --> 19:04.520
Pleasure's a very simple thing.

19:06.230 --> 19:07.231
People forget that.

19:10.776 --> 19:11.777
You know,

19:11.777 --> 19:13.153
you didn't tell me your name.

19:13.654 --> 19:15.364
You don't have to, but you didn't.

19:16.949 --> 19:18.242
I'm Kelly.

19:18.242 --> 19:19.701
Nice to meet you, Kelly.

19:21.286 --> 19:25.958
No. I'm not Kelly. I'm Sheila.

19:27.835 --> 19:30.587
- Okay, well, nice to meet you, Sheila.
- I-- Nice to meet you, Carlos.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.297
I don't know why I did that.

19:32.297 --> 19:33.924
I was just trying to be, you know,

19:34.758 --> 19:36.218
- mysterious and--
- No, no need to explain.

19:38.178 --> 19:41.890
<i>I love you, a bushel and a peck</i>

19:41.890 --> 19:45.435
<i>I love you with a hug around the neck</i>

19:47.604 --> 19:49.481
Okay. Good night.

19:59.992 --> 20:01.034
Daddy.

20:01.535 --> 20:03.662
I know, sweetheart. And I wanna help you,

20:03.662 --> 20:06.999
but not as much as I want you
to learn on your own. Okay?

20:07.749 --> 20:08.750
You can do it.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.464
Have a good run.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.134
Find something great in it.

20:19.136 --> 20:21.180
Food, clothing, services.

20:21.180 --> 20:26.268
Now, imagine
a state-of-the-art retail village

20:26.268 --> 20:28.896
built just a couple hundred yards
from the athletes' quarters.

20:28.896 --> 20:32.149
A public private partnership.

20:32.649 --> 20:36.403
- <i>Well, that sounds exciting.</i>
- I think it's the future.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.988
<i>But I'd like to pitch you on another role.</i>

20:38.572 --> 20:41.033
- Course.
- <i>Porta potties.</i>

20:43.452 --> 20:44.286
Excuse me?

20:44.286 --> 20:47.039
<i>We'll need something
on the order of 5,000 porta potties</i>

20:47.039 --> 20:48.874
<i>around the competition sites.</i>

20:48.874 --> 20:53.337
<i>And given your background in construction,
we think you could be our man.</i>

20:55.964 --> 21:00.552
I can source toilets, sure, but I think
there's a bigger opportunity here to--

21:00.552 --> 21:02.596
<i>Tell you what, you nail this,</i>

21:02.596 --> 21:04.765
<i>and you'll have a lot of fans
on the committee.</i>

21:08.143 --> 21:09.144
Sure.

21:09.144 --> 21:11.605
<i>Good man.
We'll loop you in with logistics.</i>

21:12.564 --> 21:13.815
Yeah. Loop me in.

21:15.776 --> 21:17.903
Can I have a private word
with my wife, please?

21:24.368 --> 21:26.078
That was Heath Rudiger on the phone.

21:27.538 --> 21:31.667
After weeks and weeks of networking
with the LA Games Committee,

21:33.001 --> 21:35.295
I've been assigned porta potties.

21:37.798 --> 21:42.594
My contribution to the '84 Games
will be toilets.

21:44.429 --> 21:45.597
And this is my fault?

21:45.597 --> 21:48.350
Your behavior at dinner
certainly contributed.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.060
- That isn't fair.
- Isn't it?

21:53.105 --> 21:55.190
You just invent new ways to humiliate me.

21:56.525 --> 22:00.529
You have an affair,
you mock me in front of strangers.

22:00.529 --> 22:02.990
I'm made a captive in my own home.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.366
And in spite of that,

22:04.366 --> 22:06.660
I'm expected to be obedient and--

22:09.162 --> 22:13.417
If you want peace, John,
things are gonna have to change.

22:19.882 --> 22:22.259
I'm trying to figure out
what this reminds me of.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.263
It's on the tip of my tongue.

22:27.806 --> 22:29.349
My older sister's lip gloss.

22:30.142 --> 22:32.936
It smelled just as good as this
and tasted just as terrible,

22:32.936 --> 22:34.980
so caramel is out.

22:40.235 --> 22:42.154
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

22:43.614 --> 22:46.074
'Cause in the meeting you seem very, just...

22:48.994 --> 22:50.662
We don't have to do any of this.

22:50.662 --> 22:52.122
Hand to God, Sheila,

22:52.623 --> 22:55.125
if dealing with the cookies
is too much for you given your--

22:56.710 --> 22:58.837
- Just your health comes first.
- I'm actually fine.

23:00.172 --> 23:02.466
Really? Because you seem
very distracted and it feels--

23:02.466 --> 23:03.592
I met someone.

23:03.592 --> 23:06.678
I think. I mean, no, I know I met him.

23:06.678 --> 23:11.642
I just think he could maybe be someone.

23:12.392 --> 23:14.478
- Oh, my Lord in heaven.
- Stop.

23:14.478 --> 23:16.897
Wait, no, here I am
thinking you're-- And you're--

23:16.897 --> 23:18.899
- You met someone? Tell me everything.
- Yeah.

23:18.899 --> 23:22.110
There's nothing to tell,
really. I mean, we talked.

23:22.110 --> 23:26.949
And he was funny
and he seemed kind of real.

23:28.116 --> 23:29.576
- He fed me.
- Stop.

23:30.786 --> 23:32.955
And, I gave him my phone number.

23:32.955 --> 23:35.040
I just wrote it down and gave it to him.

23:35.624 --> 23:37.292
I me-- Who am I?

23:39.378 --> 23:40.379
I'm so sorry,

23:40.379 --> 23:41.880
- but I think about you so much...
- Stop.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.091
...and I am always afraid to ask.

23:44.091 --> 23:47.719
- And then you have this beautiful news--
- No, it's nothing yet.

23:47.719 --> 23:49.054
- Yeah, it's-- Of course.
- Yeah.

23:49.054 --> 23:51.557
- I'm just gonna eat cookies.
- I mean, maybe it's something.

23:51.557 --> 23:52.975
It actually started with the cookies.

23:52.975 --> 23:56.228
I went to a restaurant alone
to try to figure out what I like.

23:56.228 --> 23:57.729
Anyway, he--

23:57.729 --> 24:02.693
He showed up
and, well, turns out maybe I do know.

24:08.073 --> 24:10.158
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

24:10.158 --> 24:12.202
But I know I don't like
caramel or strawberry.

24:12.202 --> 24:16.290
<i>I love you, a bushel and a peck</i>

24:16.957 --> 24:21.420
- <i>I love you with a hug around the neck</i>
- Love you. Neck, yes.

24:23.839 --> 24:25.215
Okay. Good night.

24:31.930 --> 24:33.849
Shit. Fuck.

25:20.270 --> 25:21.647
Oh, shit.

25:38.956 --> 25:39.957
Oh, God.

25:45.462 --> 25:46.588
Okay.

25:46.588 --> 25:52.469
So, over the loop,
over the thing, you go around the tree.

25:53.804 --> 25:55.347
Then you do the next one.

25:56.515 --> 25:58.141
Count your blessings.

25:58.141 --> 26:02.229
You are living a gift.
Not everyone's so lucky.

26:03.313 --> 26:04.314
Run free.

26:04.982 --> 26:05.983
Assholes.

26:05.983 --> 26:07.067
And--

26:09.069 --> 26:12.614
No, the keys. Grab the ke-- All right.
Let's go, come on. Let's go.

26:36.763 --> 26:39.016
Sorry. Can you drink coffee
while you're doing that?

26:42.477 --> 26:43.478
I don't know.

26:47.357 --> 26:48.650
So how's that going?

26:50.277 --> 26:53.447
- You're asking me how pumping is going?
- Sure, yeah.

26:53.447 --> 26:55.157
You know, it's part of it, right?

26:55.657 --> 26:57.201
This crazy ride we're all on.

26:58.368 --> 26:59.411
- Right.
- The balance of being

26:59.411 --> 27:01.205
a parent and a professional.

27:02.664 --> 27:05.834
Right. Well, going swell.

27:07.044 --> 27:09.171
Good.

27:10.214 --> 27:11.215
I have a daughter.

27:12.382 --> 27:13.383
Maya.

27:16.595 --> 27:19.264
It's so strange how these things
that give life meaning

27:19.264 --> 27:23.644
can leave us feeling so disconnected
from ourselves.

27:25.562 --> 27:27.189
But maybe that's the point, you know?

27:27.189 --> 27:30.609
To come out of this changed and better.

27:31.568 --> 27:32.819
And it's not about balance at all.

27:32.819 --> 27:35.739
It is sacrifice so that we can grow.

27:38.408 --> 27:39.910
You know what gets me through?

27:41.495 --> 27:42.621
I humbly submit.

27:44.164 --> 27:50.087
One day, I'm gonna be sucked dry
and I'll have nothing left to offer.

27:50.087 --> 27:54.007
Not to the kids, not to my job. Nothing.

27:55.926 --> 27:57.177
And then it'll be over.

28:05.894 --> 28:07.729
- I'm gonna get you another coffee.
- Yeah.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.068
Love it if it was hot.

28:16.029 --> 28:19.241
- We love the chocolate.
- Wonderful.

28:19.825 --> 28:23.287
But my profit participation
goes up 50 basis points every quarter.

28:29.001 --> 28:29.918
Yay.

28:40.929 --> 28:42.556
Okay.

28:47.269 --> 28:48.729
- Go ahead.
- Okay. Yeah.

28:50.898 --> 28:52.983
- Hello.
- <i>Hey, Deb.</i>

28:52.983 --> 28:55.986
- Danny Banany! Who died?
- <i>No one.</i>

28:55.986 --> 29:00.282
No one died. I just wanted to call
and check on my baby sister.

29:00.282 --> 29:02.951
- <i>It's been a long time.</i>
- Are you high?

29:03.452 --> 29:05.662
No. I'm not.

29:06.872 --> 29:07.873
Me neither.

29:09.791 --> 29:13.128
You know, I was just sitting here

29:13.128 --> 29:16.715
and I was thinking,
do you need a place to stay right now?

29:16.715 --> 29:20.594
I mean, you know me, Banany,
I always do and never do. Why?

29:20.594 --> 29:25.724
Well, I just happen to have
a foldout couch,

29:26.642 --> 29:30.604
in this vibrant coastal hamlet,
and it's just calling your name.

29:30.604 --> 29:33.857
<i>You could come and hang
and refresh your tan.</i>

29:33.857 --> 29:35.859
- What happened?
- What do you mean?

29:35.859 --> 29:38.946
<i>I left you a message
about Avery's untimely death,</i>

29:38.946 --> 29:40.697
and I didn't hear a word from you.

29:41.532 --> 29:43.283
You know how much I loved that bird.

29:47.037 --> 29:49.623
Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

29:51.250 --> 29:52.918
Sheila and I are getting a divorce.

29:52.918 --> 29:54.628
There it is.

29:57.172 --> 29:58.173
Oh, no.

29:59.383 --> 30:02.553
I don't know if you're trying to
sound sad or surprised.

30:03.220 --> 30:06.390
I'm sorry. How are you coping?

30:06.390 --> 30:07.599
<i>I...</i>

30:07.599 --> 30:13.480
I've got Maya half the time and it
turns out that I'm a fraud of a dad.

30:13.480 --> 30:18.569
And beyond that,
I'm pretty fucking lost, Deb,

30:18.569 --> 30:20.070
and I could use some help.

30:22.072 --> 30:23.490
And I've got grass.

30:25.909 --> 30:26.952
I'll be on the next bus.

30:26.952 --> 30:29.329
Great.

30:29.997 --> 30:31.498
<i>Good football.</i>

30:33.292 --> 30:37.796
<i>A ball to Schneider.
He'll fling it wide to Miller.</i>

30:41.300 --> 30:42.301
Good evening.

30:42.301 --> 30:43.844
You have no idea.

30:45.846 --> 30:47.639
- Should we go upstairs?
- Nope.

30:47.639 --> 30:51.143
- Let me just turn off the game here.
- The only thing I need you to do

30:51.768 --> 30:53.896
is get these slacks off before--

30:55.814 --> 30:58.025
I broke your belt buckle. Oops.

30:59.359 --> 31:02.070
Something sure put a battery in your back.

31:02.070 --> 31:03.197
Yeah. I have news.

31:04.615 --> 31:05.616
Okay.

31:05.616 --> 31:10.037
I-- Sheila and I just closed
an endorsement deal

31:10.037 --> 31:11.872
with a diet food company.

31:12.956 --> 31:14.124
A lucrative one.

31:14.666 --> 31:16.752
Well, you sure have been busy.

31:18.712 --> 31:19.713
Okay.

31:20.964 --> 31:23.926
I hope you understand
the spirit with which--

31:24.885 --> 31:27.095
Jesus. Spit it out, Greta. Okay.

31:31.934 --> 31:36.688
The thing is, I haven't felt good about us
these last few months.

31:38.482 --> 31:41.068
It's like, the more we became partners,

31:41.068 --> 31:45.489
the less we were, you know, partners.

31:45.489 --> 31:51.119
And I just think it would be better, healthier,

31:52.371 --> 31:57.334
if we ran the business... without you.

32:01.797 --> 32:05.008
Ern, I just wanna get us back to normal--

32:05.008 --> 32:06.385
I'd like to watch the game.

32:13.267 --> 32:14.935
<i>Just into the attacking form.</i>

32:29.908 --> 32:31.118
<i>Try left side.</i>

32:32.619 --> 32:38.500
You're doing it.
Fighting, winning, hurting, healing.

32:39.626 --> 32:43.130
This is good. You're good.

32:44.756 --> 32:50.095
And yet, here you are in the bathroom,
talking to yourself.

32:50.804 --> 32:52.347
Hard to spin that one, isn't it?

33:09.114 --> 33:10.282
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:10.282 --> 33:13.410
So, I was thinking Italian.
You know, there's also--
