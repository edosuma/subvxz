WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:02.961
Previously...

00:03.040 --> 00:05.407
This must reach
Madame Murray without fail.

00:05.480 --> 00:08.131
It is worth more than my life.
You're a soldier now.

00:08.600 --> 00:09.761
I will not fail you, Milord.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.160
A wife who won't Jet me touch her.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.251
Admit it. You are using this pregnancy
to keep me at a distance.

00:15.480 --> 00:16.481
Name?

00:16.560 --> 00:18.801
James Malcolm Mackenzie Fraser.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.769
This man spared
my youngest brother's life,

00:20.840 --> 00:23.571
incurring a bloody great debt of honour.

00:23.640 --> 00:25.244
I doubt he'll live through the journey.

00:25.640 --> 00:26.766
Claire, she's here.

00:26.880 --> 00:30.726
Maybe this really... Really
can be a new beginning.

00:30.840 --> 00:31.841
Yes.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.007
- For all of us.
- Yes.

00:34.680 --> 00:39.163
Jamie, can you hear me?
You've come home to Lallybroch.

00:39.720 --> 00:41.324
Lallybroch...

00:48.120 --> 00:50.771
Sing me a song

00:50.840 --> 00:53.571
Of a lass that is gone

00:53.680 --> 00:56.445
Say, could that lass

00:56.520 --> 00:58.409
Be Y?

00:59.400 --> 01:01.528
Merry of soul

01:01.600 --> 01:04.410
She sailed on a day

01:04.480 --> 01:06.642
Over the sea

01:06.720 --> 01:08.802
To Skye

01:09.840 --> 01:12.411
Billow and breeze

01:12.480 --> 01:14.721
Islands and seas

01:14.840 --> 01:19.289
Mountains of rain and sun

01:20.120 --> 01:22.691
All that was good

01:22.760 --> 01:24.649
All that was fair

01:25.480 --> 01:27.721
All that was me

01:27.800 --> 01:30.485
ls gone

01:30.560 --> 01:32.881
Sing me a song

01:32.960 --> 01:35.770
Of a lass that is gone

01:35.840 --> 01:37.683
Say, could that lass

01:38.240 --> 01:39.969
Be I?

01:40.920 --> 01:43.048
Merry of soul

01:43.120 --> 01:45.930
She sailed on a day

01:46.040 --> 01:49.601
Over the sea

01:50.160 --> 01:55.246
To Skye

02:30.640 --> 02:31.880
You're sure it's in the dovecote?

02:31.960 --> 02:35.646
Aye. I saw it with my own eYes.
Followed him here as he was hiding it.

02:35.720 --> 02:36.767
Put it in one of the nests.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.001
What if father catches us?

02:38.120 --> 02:41.124
He won't. He's round the back milking.
Now shut your gab.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.611
It's here. I swear.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.369
I swear, you're lying-

03:17.000 --> 03:18.081
Told you.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.606
It's my fathers, so I get to hold it.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.485
No, you're too young,
and you don't know how it works.

03:24.600 --> 03:25.601
You don't either.

03:27.480 --> 03:32.691
I've been to war. I was at Prestonpans.
I killed a filthy redcoat officer.

03:32.960 --> 03:36.169
And you killed him with a knife, aye?
And it was bloody.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.084
Aye, bloody.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.888
It's much braver
to kill a man with a knife.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.962
Nothing but flesh and metal between you.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.286
I only wish Milord didn't send me home.

03:50.280 --> 03:52.044
I could've fought at Culloden too.

03:58.680 --> 03:59.966
Redcoats. Hide.

04:05.280 --> 04:06.725
Move, cripple.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.087
- Father!
-It's okay, Jamie.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.082
Treat me as you will,
but leave the lad be.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.764
If you trained your mongrels better,

04:21.839 --> 04:23.569
I wouldn't need to kick them
to keep them in line.

04:23.640 --> 04:24.641
Keep moving!

04:26.280 --> 04:27.327
Move!

04:28.600 --> 04:32.161
I'm Captain Samuel Lewis,
of His Majesty's Tenth Dragoons.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.480
I'm here for the Dunbonnet.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.443
The Dunbonnet?
No one here goes by that name.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.208
I should think not, openly.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.761
I have it on good authority

04:42.840 --> 04:44.763
that the notorious traitor
known as Red Jamie

04:44.840 --> 04:46.001
is in concealment nearabouts,

04:46.080 --> 04:49.721
and there's gossip in these pans
about another man called the Dunbonnet.

04:50.360 --> 04:53.489
We dinna get to the village much.
I canna say I've heard that.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.684
No? He's an outlaw
that wears a brown hat

04:56.760 --> 04:58.603
to cover his distinctive red hair.

04:59.480 --> 05:03.485
I surmise that the Dunbonnet
and Red Jamie are one and the same.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.928
You tell a braw tale there, Captain.

05:11.720 --> 05:14.246
James Fraser is your
brother-in-law, is he not?

05:14.320 --> 05:16.368
And this is his clan land?

05:16.800 --> 05:19.690
It was.
These lands belong to my son now.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.165
We've not seen nor heard
from Jamie Fraser

05:23.240 --> 05:26.323
since he left to fight
in the rebellion six years ago.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.085
Pardon me, sir, if I don't take you
or your wife's word for it.

05:30.360 --> 05:34.524
I remind you that anyone who harbours
or renders aid to a Jacobite fugitive

05:34.600 --> 05:37.285
commits high treason
and will be hanged under law.

05:37.920 --> 05:42.687
Man, woman... Or child.

05:45.280 --> 05:48.011
You're welcome to search the house
and the grounds, if you please,

05:48.080 --> 05:49.320
but I'll tell you the same as I told

05:49.400 --> 05:52.688
Lieutenant Harding,
Captain Abbot, Major Mercer,

05:52.760 --> 05:56.287
and every other government officer
who comes to command these parts.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.767
You'll find no sign
of my traitorous brother here.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.571
Nor any follower of the Stuarts.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.727
There is a substantial reward
for information

06:07.800 --> 06:09.564
leading to the capture of Red Jamie,

06:10.000 --> 06:15.006
so if you know of his whereabouts,
you would be wise to turn him over now.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.321
We canna give you what
we dinna have, Captain.

06:22.720 --> 06:23.721
Very well.

06:25.440 --> 06:27.283
Corporal MacGregor, arrest Mr Murray.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.763
Perhaps some time in the garrison's
cells will help him change his mind.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.808
A Scot in a redcoat.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.245
You're the traitor.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.083
You filthy frog-eater.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.401
Mind your tongue or I'll cut it out.

06:39.480 --> 06:43.007
Fergus, Rabbis, finish milking
and mind your chores.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.324
He'll be fine, mistress.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.930
Court's released him
each time they've seen fit to take him.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.889
There's no reason
to think this times any different.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.725
That's a damnable shame.
Corporal MacGregor.

07:01.360 --> 07:02.964
Aye, a lowlander.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.611
Many a MacGregor
fought for the Jacobites,

07:05.760 --> 07:08.764
but a few fought
for the government during the '45.

07:08.840 --> 07:10.808
And now they think
they're better than us,

07:10.920 --> 07:13.127
but what the daft loons
don't realise is,

07:13.200 --> 07:15.202
the British hate them just the same.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.966
You scared the bowels out of me.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.051
They've taken Ian again.

09:27.840 --> 09:29.649
I foolishly hoped they were through

09:29.720 --> 09:33.042
when two years passed
with no redcoats bedevilling us.

09:36.160 --> 09:37.605
We could go after them, Milord.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.890
We could slit their throats in the night
and free Monsieur Murray.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.644
Aye. That's a fine idea.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.529
A deed like that
would bring the whole garrison

09:44.600 --> 09:47.524
lo Lallybroch lo kill us all,
yourself included.

09:51.080 --> 09:54.482
I reckon every new commander
needs to make a name for himself.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.928
Captain Lewis
was talking about the Dunbonnet.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.808
That's what they've taken
to calling you now.

09:59.880 --> 10:02.326
Soon enough you'll have ballads
sung in your honour.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.003
'Tis time to tally the rents.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.969
Ian was just about to start
on the books.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.440
Dinna suppose you could do that for me.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.206
Brother...

10:24.400 --> 10:25.401
Brother!

10:26.680 --> 10:29.923
You ken why I can lie
to the British and feel at peace?

10:30.640 --> 10:32.165
It's because I'm not lying.

10:32.360 --> 10:35.762
James Fraser hasna been here
for a long, long time.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.445
Here you go.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.049
There you go.

12:30.600 --> 12:33.206
Now, here's bunny.

12:34.440 --> 12:35.441
Okay.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.366
Shall we see what The Globe
has to say today?

12:50.240 --> 12:52.925
"Ireland joins the rosier
of free nations.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.010
"To the roar of guns
and the flash of fireworks in the sky,

12:56.080 --> 12:58.287
"the republic of Ireland
was born today."

12:59.160 --> 13:00.286
Sweetheart.

13:00.360 --> 13:03.045
This is history in the making.
You'll want to hear this.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.331
"The Republic,
free of British rule, have to..."

13:12.560 --> 13:14.369
You turned over!

13:15.840 --> 13:17.808
All by yourself.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.001
You turned...

13:21.080 --> 13:23.082
Hot water cut out
in the middle of my shower.

13:23.160 --> 13:24.525
The boiler must be out again.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.968
What a clever girl you are.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.201
Why? What happened?

13:29.280 --> 13:32.090
She turned over, all by herself.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.049
Isn't it early for her to be doing that?

13:36.160 --> 13:39.448
Well, Dr Spock says she shouldn't be
doing it for at least another month.

13:39.520 --> 13:43.286
Well, what does Dr Spock know?
Come here, come to Daddy.

13:43.360 --> 13:44.566
Give me a kiss.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.722
You're so clever. Yeah.

13:59.640 --> 14:00.641
- Well...
- Yeah.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.802
I should go check the boiler.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.848
I was careful. Wasn't followed.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.491
Cut back on myself,
just like you taught me.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.450
I want to learn to shoot, Milord.

15:33.680 --> 15:34.681
Where'd you get this?

15:35.920 --> 15:37.922
It was hidden in the dovecote.

15:39.840 --> 15:43.162
I want to defend our home.
I need to be ready.

15:43.520 --> 15:44.760
For what?

15:45.640 --> 15:46.721
Our next rebellion.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.326
There will be no next rebellion.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.526
Bug Wont...

15:52.600 --> 15:54.329
No more fighting.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.410
Just because you're a coward now
doesn't mean I am.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.560
Weapons are outlawed.

16:10.080 --> 16:13.368
Put it back where you found it.
Don't touch it again.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.401
Sir.

16:43.160 --> 16:45.242
Dinna ken ye were expected today.

16:53.400 --> 16:54.845
Came to look at the ledgers.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.281
Where's my sister

17:03.040 --> 17:04.371
Dinna fash.

17:04.760 --> 17:08.606
The bairn had a mind to come early.
Ye'll soon have a new niece or nephew.

17:26.359 --> 17:27.930
The bairn is on the way.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.401
Aye.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.121
A raven!

17:33.480 --> 17:36.211
My granny says that ravens
are messengers of death.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.406
Canna be near the house.
The bairn will die!

17:44.920 --> 17:47.605
Bullet. Hand me the cloth.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.330
Ye sure that's how it works?

17:52.000 --> 17:54.970
Yes, I watched Murtagh
instructing the soldiers.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.444
I told you never to touch this again.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.851
There was a raven.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.730
We were protecting the bairn.

18:42.320 --> 18:46.291
Sir, ye have a wee nephew.
He's fine and healthy.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.690
What were ye thinkin', Rabbie?

19:02.680 --> 19:04.125
Dinna be causing any more trouble.

19:13.240 --> 19:14.685
I thought I'd call him Ian.

19:15.680 --> 19:18.490
Time we named one
after the man that sired them.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.651
Ye always look braw
with a wee bairn in yer arms.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.571
How long's it been
since you've lain with a woman, Jamie?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.047
Don't...

19:40.080 --> 19:41.081
Janet

19:41.200 --> 19:43.521
"She's dead."
That's all you ever told me.

19:44.360 --> 19:46.010
I dinna ken how or why.

19:47.440 --> 19:48.885
It's been six years now.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.768
Mary MacNab's
still young enough for bairns.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.882
I couldna run the household without her,
after Mrs Crook died,

19:57.960 --> 19:59.371
and she's a fine mother to Rabbis.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.646
I won't marry.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.201
Ever again.

20:05.520 --> 20:08.205
It's God's sorrow ye never had
the chance to bring a child into this...

20:08.280 --> 20:10.248
Maybe the bairn should meet his brother.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.640
There's still time.

20:12.600 --> 20:13.726
Do ye hear me, brother I just...

20:14.240 --> 20:16.971
I just want you to have some happiness!

20:21.560 --> 20:22.607
Find the weapon.

20:23.280 --> 20:24.281
Yes, Captain.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.805
Jenkins, move!

20:33.360 --> 20:34.566
Where's your mistress?

20:42.880 --> 20:45.850
You three, search the rooms downstairs.
MacGregor, come with me.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.246
Get that pistol!

20:51.400 --> 20:52.640
Where's the weapon?

20:52.720 --> 20:55.564
Weapon?
We have no weapons here, Captain.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.241
My scouts heard a shot
from the vicinity of this estate,

20:58.360 --> 21:01.409
so I ask again.
Where are you hiding the weapon?

21:01.720 --> 21:04.371
I canna answer
for what yer scouts heard,

21:04.440 --> 21:08.001
but I'll tell you again,
I dinna know of any weapons here.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.326
We'd never risk such a thing.

21:10.280 --> 21:13.124
I remind you, madam, that as an officer
in His Majesty's army,

21:13.200 --> 21:17.046
I am obliged to search this house
should I have the slightest suspicion

21:17.120 --> 21:19.327
that the act of prescription
has been breached.

21:20.120 --> 21:23.567
And we will continue to do so
until you comply with my request.

21:26.360 --> 21:29.523
Captain, I have cooperated
with every request

21:29.640 --> 21:31.608
made by His Majesty's soldiers.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.482
Have you delivered a child, madam?

21:42.920 --> 21:44.046
Aye.

21:45.600 --> 21:46.601
Where is it?

21:47.560 --> 21:48.641
Should it not be at your breast?

21:52.520 --> 21:53.851
It was a fearsome birth,

21:54.680 --> 21:57.001
and the bairn wasna breathing
when he came.

21:57.320 --> 22:00.767
Ye see... He was already gone.

22:01.560 --> 22:02.561
Good.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.209
It's one less teutcher
we'll have to deal with.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.770
Hold your tongue, Corporal.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.366
Where's the body?

22:11.440 --> 22:14.205
The midwife took ii away
to clean it for burial.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.244
Find the midwife
and have her bring the body.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.367
Sir.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.689
Captain, please, I canna bear it.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.728
Here's the pistol, Captain.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.327
'Tis mine.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.201
Yours?

22:30.920 --> 22:33.161
It belonged to my late husband, Ronald.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.811
It was the only thing
I had left of him, so I kept it.

22:35.880 --> 22:39.771
It gave me comfort.
Mistress Murray knew nothing of it.

22:40.480 --> 22:42.482
And what occasion did you have
to fire it?

22:43.120 --> 22:48.001
I saw a raven land near the house
while Milady was delivering her child.

22:48.440 --> 22:50.010
So I shot it dead.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.606
Just one of the foolish
highland superstitions, Sir.

22:52.680 --> 22:55.331
Believing a common bird
can bring ill luck.

22:56.200 --> 23:00.000
But it was too late.
As I told you, the bairn was born dead.

23:00.720 --> 23:01.721
Aye.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.964
Aye. I'm heart sorry, mistress.

23:06.040 --> 23:07.610
Should I take her into custody, Captain?

23:13.560 --> 23:15.562
We have the weapon. She's no threat.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.251
But I warn you once more, madam,

23:18.680 --> 23:21.365
if another violation occurs,
there will be no mercy.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.485
Corporal, if you please!

24:04.240 --> 24:05.480
Thank ye, Mary. Ye did well.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.205
They're gone.

24:16.840 --> 24:19.810
This new captain,
I've seen the look of his eYes.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.120
He's no' one to give up.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.082
He'll no' stop till ye're hanging
from the end of a rope.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.405
Take a shovel.

24:33.480 --> 24:36.006
Dig a grave in the cemetery,
in case they look.

25:21.680 --> 25:22.681
Claire?

25:36.360 --> 25:37.361
What is it?

25:38.480 --> 25:40.130
I miss my husband.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.804
Go and rot, peg leg.

27:06.880 --> 27:08.848
Half the garrison
are searching to the north,

27:08.920 --> 27:10.206
and the other half
are searching to the south.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.810
It's only a matter of time
until we find Red Jamie.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.530
Then we'll be back for you...

27:16.960 --> 27:18.689
And yer whole family.

27:20.080 --> 27:21.081
Aye, well...

27:21.920 --> 27:23.684
It's been a lovely visit, gentlemen.

29:05.520 --> 29:07.807
The brat is leading us in circles.

29:08.320 --> 29:10.004
I believe he is, sir.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.001
You think you're smart?

29:12.320 --> 29:16.086
I knew you were following me.
But you can't trick me, you imbeciles.

29:17.480 --> 29:20.006
Tell us where Red Jamie is.

29:20.520 --> 29:23.171
I know that you know,
you filthy frog-eater.

29:23.280 --> 29:24.691
There's no Red Jamie here.

29:25.320 --> 29:26.321
Leave us alone!

29:26.400 --> 29:29.006
I'll get it out of you,
one way or another.

29:29.120 --> 29:31.566
You're harassing us.
We don't want you around here!

29:34.760 --> 29:36.569
You're all pieces of shit.

29:36.640 --> 29:37.721
Go to hell!

29:37.800 --> 29:41.088
Dirty Scotsman.
You betray your own people.

29:41.480 --> 29:45.565
And the Scots hate you for it.
You'll never be one of them.

29:45.640 --> 29:47.483
Ye brazen wee bastard.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.209
Your face is as red as your coat!

29:55.520 --> 29:56.521
You pansies!

29:56.680 --> 29:57.681
I'll rip your tongue out!

29:57.960 --> 29:59.325
Filthy redcoats!

29:59.440 --> 30:01.044
You'll pay for those words!

30:01.960 --> 30:05.043
That tongue will get
my boot up your ass!

30:05.240 --> 30:06.241
You morons!

30:06.360 --> 30:08.089
Don't taunt them.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.611
No women will have you!

30:09.680 --> 30:10.841
You'll be sorry.

30:10.920 --> 30:12.604
Get back here, ye filthy urchin!

30:12.680 --> 30:14.250
Run, you fool.

30:15.360 --> 30:17.601
French scum, we'll string you up.

30:17.680 --> 30:19.330
Canna run from me!

30:25.320 --> 30:26.401
Hold him down!

30:26.480 --> 30:27.481
Go to hell!

30:32.040 --> 30:33.041
No!

30:33.120 --> 30:34.531
Wait, he's just a lad.

30:44.880 --> 30:46.166
Come on, leave him.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.529
If we do nothing, he'll die!

30:48.600 --> 30:50.967
That's an order, Private.

31:09.520 --> 31:10.760
Hold.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.441
Dinna be featl. Fergus, laddie.

31:16.960 --> 31:19.088
I watched Milady do this many times.

31:58.520 --> 32:00.682
Yer quick actions saved him, brother.

32:03.160 --> 32:04.241
I should have stopped them.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.480
Then ye'd be dead and so would he.

32:07.800 --> 32:08.801
We'd all be dead.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.606
Brother...

32:46.480 --> 32:48.005
Ye all right, ye wee fool

32:55.080 --> 32:56.570
I'm sorry, Milord.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.321
I tried to lead them away from the cave.

32:59.840 --> 33:00.841
Ye did well.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.482
I'm the one who should be sorry.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.765
You remind me...

33:16.440 --> 33:18.522
I have something to fight for.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.285
There you are, Word.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.040
Here.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.167
Does it hurt much?

33:41.120 --> 33:42.121
A bit.

33:44.120 --> 33:46.521
Sometimes it feels warm or scratchy,

33:47.440 --> 33:49.124
or hurls like it's still there.

33:51.600 --> 33:52.601
But...

33:53.480 --> 33:56.051
Madame has been
most generous with the whiskey.

33:57.240 --> 34:00.005
Although you know
that I prefer the taste of French wine.

34:09.560 --> 34:11.608
Do not trouble yourself, Milord.

34:12.560 --> 34:14.005
I have been fortunate.

34:14.880 --> 34:17.281
Do you recall the agreement
we made in Paris?

34:17.719 --> 34:19.768
When you hired me
to steal letters for you?

34:26.280 --> 34:27.281
Aye.

34:28.960 --> 34:33.045
You said,
should I be arrested or executed,

34:34.040 --> 34:36.327
you would have masses
said for me for a year.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.688
And should I lose an ear...

34:42.120 --> 34:44.487
Or a hand while doing your service...

34:44.880 --> 34:49.204
That I would support you
for the rest of your life.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.844
You can trust me

34:55.120 --> 34:56.610
to keep that bargain.

34:59.080 --> 35:01.367
I have always trusted you, Milord.

35:03.400 --> 35:04.890
I think I'm most lucky.

35:06.440 --> 35:07.646
In one stroke,

35:08.320 --> 35:10.800
I have become a man of leisure, no

35:20.600 --> 35:21.761
What do you call this again?

35:22.200 --> 35:23.964
It's called Eton Mess.

35:24.080 --> 35:27.687
Well, a cheerful term
for a failed Pavlova.

35:28.280 --> 35:30.487
Well, it's damn delicious,
whatever you call it.

35:30.560 --> 35:31.846
Maybe you could give Millie the recipe.

35:31.920 --> 35:33.365
I'd be happy to.

35:33.440 --> 35:36.523
Now, Jerry, when was the last time
you saw me bake anything?

35:36.600 --> 35:39.331
If I can't find it
in the frozen section at the A&P,

35:39.400 --> 35:40.401
we're not having dessert.

35:40.480 --> 35:41.481
True. You know,

35:41.560 --> 35:43.164
I knew she was no Betty Crocker
when I married her,

35:43.240 --> 35:44.685
but her talents

35:45.080 --> 35:46.445
lie elsewhere.

35:46.640 --> 35:48.085
Stop.

35:57.840 --> 35:58.921
Would anyone like more

35:59.400 --> 36:01.289
- Heck, yeah.
- Twist my arm.

36:06.960 --> 36:08.371
You mind if we kill the bottle?

36:09.400 --> 36:10.765
It's all yours.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.170
Well, cheers.

36:15.880 --> 36:17.689
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.086
Nightcap?

36:29.120 --> 36:30.121
Please.

36:33.240 --> 36:37.040
So which of Millie's talents
do you think Jerry was referring to?

36:38.440 --> 36:40.647
Well, it's obviously

36:40.760 --> 36:45.846
her encyclopaedic knowledge
of the complete works of Shakespeare.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.241
You are a snob.

36:49.600 --> 36:50.931
You asked the question.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.171
Claire, look at me.

38:27.120 --> 38:28.121
Baby...

38:28.800 --> 38:29.801
Claire, open your eYes.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.126
Why have you stopped?

38:44.120 --> 38:48.125
You... You never used to close
your eYes when we made love.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.764
It doesn't mean anything.
I'm enjoying this.

38:53.600 --> 38:54.601
Are you?

38:55.840 --> 38:56.966
Of course.

38:59.080 --> 39:00.730
Then why can't you look at me

39:04.360 --> 39:05.691
Christ, Frank.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.650
If you're not in the mood,
you just had to say.

39:13.240 --> 39:14.685
Claire, when I'm with you,

39:15.800 --> 39:16.881
I'm with you...

39:20.080 --> 39:21.320
But you're with him.

39:38.920 --> 39:39.921
My leg,

39:41.480 --> 39:42.720
it's not there,

39:44.760 --> 39:46.728
as anyone can plainly see.

39:47.600 --> 39:51.321
And yet, it pains me terrible sometimes.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.325
Even wakes me up at night.

39:54.640 --> 39:56.290
Fergus, the lad,

39:57.160 --> 39:59.242
he'll likely feel the same
with his hand.

40:01.680 --> 40:04.809
Feeling a pain
in apart of ye that's lost...

40:08.280 --> 40:09.850
And that's just a hand.

40:15.760 --> 40:17.205
Claire was yer heart.

40:52.440 --> 40:55.523
I thought perhaps the lad
could use another blanket.

41:01.640 --> 41:03.085
Who did this?

41:03.840 --> 41:06.889
The soldiers,
when they were searching the house.

41:07.880 --> 41:09.120
The redcoats...

41:12.360 --> 41:15.170
They're never gonna stop
until they find the Dunbonnet.

41:22.520 --> 41:23.965
Turn in my own brother

41:24.880 --> 41:26.484
That way, ye'll get the reward money.

41:30.040 --> 41:31.326
And they'll not come after ye,

41:32.040 --> 41:33.565
'cause of yer loyalty to the crown.

41:33.640 --> 41:35.051
To hell with the crown.

41:35.120 --> 41:36.929
Send word to Captain Lewis.

41:38.040 --> 41:39.041
Tell him...

41:42.200 --> 41:44.043
Tell him you heard from me.

41:44.480 --> 41:46.050
You know when I'll be coming,

41:46.560 --> 41:47.721
and when I do,

41:48.960 --> 41:50.485
they'll be here to arrest me.

41:50.760 --> 41:54.321
They'll know, once and for all,
you owe no allegiance to Red Jamie.

41:54.680 --> 41:56.489
Christ, man, you'll be hangit!

41:56.560 --> 41:58.642
I'll no' risk your lives
for me any longer.

41:58.720 --> 42:01.724
The British
are no' hanging Jacobites any more.

42:02.360 --> 42:04.283
It's likely he'll only be imprisoned.

42:04.360 --> 42:05.600
Only?

42:06.040 --> 42:09.806
Jamie, have ye not seen the inside
of enough prisons for one lifetime?

42:11.520 --> 42:14.046
Little difference
to the prison I live in now.

42:50.760 --> 42:52.683
Mistress Jenny has sent food.

42:54.560 --> 42:56.005
Do you mind the company?

42:59.880 --> 43:01.370
It would be welcome.

43:20.240 --> 43:21.730
What you did that day,

43:24.160 --> 43:26.162
turning the pistol over
to the Redcoats...

43:29.320 --> 43:30.560
it was very brave.

43:32.320 --> 43:34.322
'Twas the only thing I could do.

43:42.520 --> 43:43.931
Thank you for the barbering.

43:44.640 --> 43:46.005
'Twas no bother.

43:50.640 --> 43:51.721
I leave tomorrow.

43:53.240 --> 43:55.561
Ye can take the books back
to Lallybroch.

43:56.760 --> 43:57.966
Bury the rest.

43:58.320 --> 43:59.560
Stay out of sight.

43:59.920 --> 44:01.570
I'm gonna wash up in the river.

44:18.240 --> 44:19.480
Whose idea was this?

44:21.320 --> 44:22.606
Yours or my sister's?

44:23.400 --> 44:25.050
Did she think I'd change my mind?

44:26.200 --> 44:27.486
Does it matter?

44:27.600 --> 44:28.601
No.

44:29.120 --> 44:31.122
It doesn't matter
because it's not gonna happen.

44:37.040 --> 44:38.963
If you won't leave, then I'll have to.

44:39.480 --> 44:40.527
Sir.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.887
Your sister didna ask me
to do what I'm doin'.

44:48.480 --> 44:50.608
I ken well enough what ye're thinking,

44:52.520 --> 44:56.320
for I saw your lady
and how it was between the two of ye.

44:59.400 --> 45:02.802
And it's not my mind
to make ye feel ye've betrayed that.

45:05.840 --> 45:08.127
What I want
is to share something different.

45:09.920 --> 45:11.649
Something less, mayhap,

45:14.360 --> 45:16.442
but something we both need.

45:20.200 --> 45:22.168
Something to keep us whole,

45:23.360 --> 45:25.408
as we move forward in this life.

45:54.760 --> 45:56.728
I've not done this in a very long time.

45:57.640 --> 45:58.971
Neither have I.

46:36.040 --> 46:37.724
You can look at me if you'd like.

46:44.680 --> 46:46.284
Ye're a bonny lass.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.570
It's just something I always do.

47:31.840 --> 47:35.606
I threw myself
into my new role as best I could.

47:38.040 --> 47:40.646
But there was stiil something
missing in my life.

47:42.160 --> 47:44.686
Once, I had thought I was whole.

47:45.680 --> 47:47.444
I'd been able to love a man,

47:47.760 --> 47:50.366
to bear a child, to heal the sick...

47:50.440 --> 47:54.126
And all these things
were natural parts of me.

47:57.680 --> 47:59.762
But the man I had loved was Jamie,

48:00.720 --> 48:04.850
and for a time, I had been part
of something greener than myself.

48:07.360 --> 48:08.691
I wanted that again.

48:09.840 --> 48:14.926
That's why I knew, eventually,
I would need to do something more.

48:18.560 --> 48:20.130
Can I help you, miss?

48:22.400 --> 48:24.448
Isn't this the anatomy classroom?

48:24.520 --> 48:25.521
It is.

48:25.600 --> 48:28.729
Are you looking for someone?
I have a class about to start.

48:29.240 --> 48:31.004
You must be Dr Simms.

48:31.320 --> 48:33.448
I am. And you are...

48:34.200 --> 48:36.407
Claire Randall. First year.

48:37.320 --> 48:38.321
Yeah.

48:38.480 --> 48:42.724
The Dean informed me there was a woman
in this years incoming class.

48:42.840 --> 48:44.763
A woman and a Negro.

48:45.160 --> 48:48.369
How very modern of us.

49:56.040 --> 49:57.451
Is this spot taken?

49:59.120 --> 50:00.485
No, it's all yours.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.161
Thanks.

50:07.280 --> 50:08.327
Joe Abernathy.

50:11.360 --> 50:13.681
Claire Randall. Pleased to meet you.

50:14.280 --> 50:15.645
Pleased to meet you.

50:25.960 --> 50:27.200
All right, gentlemen.

50:29.120 --> 50:30.406
Let's begin.

50:32.440 --> 50:34.841
Bunny was wedged behind the bed again.

50:37.880 --> 50:39.882
I think Bree might be trying
to tell us something.

50:51.880 --> 50:53.006
Good night.

50:53.520 --> 50:54.681
Good night.

51:28.880 --> 51:30.041
Jenny.

51:36.400 --> 51:37.401
It's me.

51:42.040 --> 51:43.041
I've come home!

51:52.440 --> 51:53.441
No, Jenny, no!

51:55.320 --> 51:58.483
James Alexander Malcolm
Mackenzie Fraser,

51:59.080 --> 52:00.570
otherwise known as Red Jamie,

52:00.960 --> 52:03.281
you are hereby under arrest
for high treason

52:03.360 --> 52:04.725
against His Majesty King George.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.001
Not my own sister.

52:06.080 --> 52:07.127
Put him in the irons!

52:07.200 --> 52:08.201
How could you?

52:08.320 --> 52:10.721
This is yer own fault!
Ye brought this on yerself!

52:11.120 --> 52:12.485
Well done, madam.

52:14.560 --> 52:16.324
You've done a service to the Crown.

52:18.320 --> 52:19.606
This is blood money!

52:20.120 --> 52:22.202
Ye gave me no choice, brother!

52:22.280 --> 52:25.170
And I'll never forgive you! Never!
