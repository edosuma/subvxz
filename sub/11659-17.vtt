(mellow music playing)

00:54.400 --> 00:58.667
-Hi, Sophia. What you making?
-Lasagna al forno.

00:58.734 --> 01:00.066
Mmm. It smells delicious.

01:00.133 --> 01:02.667
Great aunt Nicholena used to say,

01:02.734 --> 01:06.000
"Making lasagna al forno
is like crossing a river.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.567
If you roll up your pants,
don't be surprised if you find clams

01:09.633 --> 01:11.133
nipping at your heels."

01:12.367 --> 01:14.834
-What did she mean?
-How the hell should I know?

01:14.900 --> 01:16.500
She was a hopeless alcoholic.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.967
Here, have a taste.

01:20.033 --> 01:24.166
-How did the audition for the play go?
-Awful!

01:24.233 --> 01:26.400
We just got two tiny parts.

01:27.033 --> 01:28.767
We're doing <i>Sound of Music.</i>

01:28.834 --> 01:30.967
And Blanche is mad
'cause she didn't get the lead.

01:31.033 --> 01:34.266
I can't believe that.

01:34.333 --> 01:36.467
You've gotten the lead
the past five years.

01:36.533 --> 01:40.100
They hired a new director,
and he has no taste.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.533
Blanche used to sleep with the old one.

01:45.233 --> 01:47.000
The new director's gay.

01:48.333 --> 01:51.467
A gay theater director!
Ever hear of such a thing?

01:52.700 --> 01:54.166
That's absolutely shocking!

01:54.233 --> 01:57.900
Next thing you know they'll have black
basketball players in the NBA.

01:59.767 --> 02:05.033
Ma, you are making lasagna al forno!
What is the occasion?

02:05.100 --> 02:08.100
There's no occasion.
I just know it's your favorite.

02:08.166 --> 02:11.867
-(doorbell rings)
-This takes 12 hours to make.

02:11.934 --> 02:15.200
-What do you want?
-Nothing. And it takes 16.

02:16.467 --> 02:20.533
You only make lasagna al forno
is for funerals and favors.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.900
You're not wearing black.
What do you want?

02:22.967 --> 02:27.467
Nothing! You're a sick, suspicious,
paranoid person.

02:29.200 --> 02:32.033
Stan! My favorite ex-son-in-law.

02:32.100 --> 02:35.133
Oh, God, Stanley.

02:35.200 --> 02:39.467
-What the hell are you doing here?
-I invited him for dinner.

02:39.533 --> 02:42.066
-What?
-Is your toupee new?

02:42.133 --> 02:45.500
Yeah. It's called the Dan Rather model.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.867
You think it makes me look more
intellectual?

02:48.934 --> 02:52.567
Oh, absolutely.
By the way, your fly's open.

02:59.100 --> 03:01.500
-I'm so embarrassed.
-Don't worry about it.

03:01.567 --> 03:04.000
I hear that Dan Rather
has the same problem.

03:05.467 --> 03:07.467
That's why he sits behind a desk.

03:08.734 --> 03:10.800
Ma, listen.
I want some answers.

03:10.867 --> 03:14.266
Why did you prepare my favorite meal

03:14.333 --> 03:18.133
and then invite my least favorite person
to eat it with us?

03:18.700 --> 03:21.467
I need a favor.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.600
You remember my brother Angelo?
He was at your wedding.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.834
He's the priest from Sicily.

03:26.900 --> 03:32.500
He's going to Brooklyn to visit the family
and insisted on stopping in Miami

03:32.567 --> 03:35.600
to wish you two a happy
40th wedding anniversary.

03:35.667 --> 03:37.200
But we're not married anymore.

03:37.767 --> 03:40.800
Which brings me to the lasagna al forno.

03:42.567 --> 03:44.834
I want you to pretend
you're still married,

03:44.900 --> 03:46.700
and we're all living here together.

03:46.767 --> 03:50.734
I won't do this.
The institution of marriage is sacred.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.700
-I'll give you 50 bucks.
-Ok, I'll do it.

03:54.934 --> 03:57.066
Dorothy, for one afternoon.

03:57.133 --> 03:59.700
It'll break his heart
if he learns you're divorced.

03:59.767 --> 04:00.934
Ma, forget it.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.333
We're divorced because Stanley
cheated on me.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.867
He's a loathsome, repulsive creature.

04:05.934 --> 04:09.400
Even pretending to be married
makes me ill.

04:09.467 --> 04:11.200
I'm still staying for dinner.

04:12.333 --> 04:14.133
Dorothy, I'll never speak to you again--

04:14.200 --> 04:16.667
-I don't care.
-I'll disinherit you.

04:16.734 --> 04:20.400
-I'll invite Stan over every night!
-How bad can it be?

04:20.467 --> 04:21.934
It's just one day.

04:23.333 --> 04:28.100
(serene music playing)

04:30.633 --> 04:32.500
I just pressed our costumes.

04:32.567 --> 04:37.667
I'm nervous about the dress rehearsal.
Let's go over our lines again.

04:37.734 --> 04:41.533
-Sure.
-Let's begin at scene three.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.934
I'm standing on the balcony
of the von Trapp home,

04:45.000 --> 04:47.500
listening to artillery shells
bursting in the distance,

04:47.567 --> 04:51.300
-and you come running from upstage.
-Ok. You ready?

04:51.367 --> 04:52.900
Yes.

04:52.967 --> 04:55.600
The Nazis are coming!

04:55.667 --> 04:58.266
Everybody, grab a gun
and go to the basement!

04:58.333 --> 05:01.734
-Come on!
-No, no, no.

05:06.633 --> 05:08.166
Sophia, just relax.

05:08.233 --> 05:11.166
We're just going over our lines
for <i>The Sound of Music.</i>

05:11.233 --> 05:13.100
Oh, thank God!

05:14.433 --> 05:18.133
-Oop! It is really coming down.
-What's coming down?

05:21.867 --> 05:24.467
The Liberace marquee at Caesar's palace.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.533
Rain! Rain, Rose!

05:28.600 --> 05:32.300
Where's that idiot Stan?
Angelo is coming any minute.

05:32.367 --> 05:35.000
Stan's always late.

05:35.066 --> 05:38.300
-He was even late for our first date.
-Then you were late.

05:38.667 --> 05:40.400
(doorbell rings)

05:42.533 --> 05:44.834
Which is why you had
to marry that stupid,

05:44.900 --> 05:50.033
lazy, no-good, pinhead of a... prince!
This man is a prince.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.934
-Come in, Stan.
-I'm sorry I'm late.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.934
The rain really tied up traffic.

05:55.533 --> 05:58.467
Hi, girls. Hello, Mama bear.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.967
Papa bear's back in the cave.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.767
I could vomit just looking at you.

06:10.667 --> 06:13.400
-(doorbell rings)
-That must be Angelo.

06:13.867 --> 06:15.667
You two go out back.
He can't see you here.

06:15.734 --> 06:18.166
Ok. Ok.

06:20.133 --> 06:22.900
-Angelo!
-Sophia!

06:22.967 --> 06:25.567
You're looking terrific!

06:25.633 --> 06:28.567
You haven't changed a bit in 40 years!

06:28.633 --> 06:33.367
-You're a priest. You shouldn't lie!
-Don't worry about it.

06:33.433 --> 06:36.800
Before the trip,
I said an extra 50 hail Marys

06:36.867 --> 06:39.567
in case I felt like cutting loose.

06:41.433 --> 06:44.033
-Dorothy!
-Uncle Angelo.

06:44.100 --> 06:49.633
-It is so good to see you!
-Dorothy, you know something?

06:49.700 --> 06:53.400
You look more beautiful now
than on your wedding day.

06:53.467 --> 06:56.600
You just used up
all 50 hail Marys on that one.

06:59.300 --> 07:04.033
Stan, you still a funny guy.
You got a sense of humor still.

07:04.100 --> 07:07.100
-Does he still make you laugh?
-Not really.

07:07.166 --> 07:10.066
But then I haven't seen him naked lately.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.700
(Sophia laughs)

07:16.467 --> 07:19.133
Would you listen to those two?
Always with the quips.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.734
So how are the children?

07:21.800 --> 07:24.834
Uncle Angelo, they're all grown up.

07:24.900 --> 07:30.500
Kate is an interior decorator in New York,
and Michael is a very successful musician.

07:30.567 --> 07:33.500
Michael didn't want to
sell novelties with me.

07:33.567 --> 07:35.967
It was a crushing blow

07:36.033 --> 07:39.133
when he decided to join
the Boston philharmonic

07:39.200 --> 07:42.333
instead of selling
rubber dog poop door to door.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.734
Don't knock the novelty business.

07:48.800 --> 07:52.700
Rubber dog poop
provided very nicely for you, the kids--

07:52.767 --> 07:54.767
And several stewardesses.

07:56.700 --> 08:00.233
-Stewardesses?
-Uh... they adopted them.

08:00.300 --> 08:03.100
After Asian babies,
they're the most popular.

08:04.266 --> 08:06.800
Ma, could I see you in the kitchen?

08:10.834 --> 08:14.166
Hurry back, Mama bear.
Papa bear gets lonely without you.

08:15.166 --> 08:18.200
Ow!

08:20.867 --> 08:25.734
-I think things are going very nicely.
-I'm telling uncle Angelo the truth.

08:25.800 --> 08:29.533
-It's only for a couple of hours more.
-I can't do it.

08:29.600 --> 08:33.367
Pretending we're married
is making me crazy.

08:33.433 --> 08:38.100
-It's time to take my heart medicine.
-You need water for your pill?

08:38.166 --> 08:42.033
No pills. I take scotch,
12 years old preferably.

08:43.734 --> 08:45.834
Uncle Angelo, I have
a confession to make.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.433
Good. I get my scotch,
and we go in the closet.

08:50.633 --> 08:54.667
-No, it's about Stan and me.
-You know something, Dorothy?

08:55.233 --> 08:56.734
On your wedding day...

08:57.133 --> 09:00.834
Sophia told me your
marriage wouldn't last.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.767
That made me very sad.

09:03.133 --> 09:07.767
And now seeing you and Stan so happy
after all of these years...

09:08.133 --> 09:10.800
it does an old man's heart good.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.500
And so does that.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.100
Uncle Angelo--

09:19.166 --> 09:22.734
I'm so glad I disobeyed
the doctor's orders

09:22.800 --> 09:26.934
and risked this long trip
to see you two so much in love.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.467
Now, what were you saying?

09:32.000 --> 09:34.700
Uncle Angelo, I wanted to say...

09:36.867 --> 09:39.300
Don't just stand there, papa bear.

09:39.367 --> 09:42.967
Come give mama bear a big bear hug!

09:44.433 --> 09:48.633
(calm music playing)

09:51.033 --> 09:54.300
-Another slice of cake, uncle Angelo?
-No, thank you.

09:54.700 --> 09:58.633
-I'll take some, darling.
-No problem, sweetheart.

09:58.700 --> 10:02.867
-Hurry back, dumpling.
-My feet have wings, barf bag.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.166
Dorothy, please hang in there
a little while longer,

10:12.233 --> 10:14.800
and Angelo will be on a plane
headed for Brooklyn.

10:14.867 --> 10:17.000
I wish I'd taken
my raincoat.

10:22.266 --> 10:27.533
-Why are you two dressed like that?
-These are our costumes.

10:27.600 --> 10:31.000
We were in dress rehearsal
when they told us to hurry home.

10:31.066 --> 10:35.500
-There's a hurricane heading for Miami.
-I will take some cake.

10:35.567 --> 10:36.800
Hello!

10:36.867 --> 10:40.967
Uh... uncle Angelo, I'd, uh...
like you to meet, uh...

10:41.967 --> 10:45.567
-I'm sister Rose.
-Nice to meet you.

10:45.633 --> 10:48.333
-I'm sister Blanche.
-Nice to meet you.

10:48.834 --> 10:51.033
We're here... uh, collecting...

10:51.533 --> 10:52.967
lingerie...

10:54.433 --> 10:56.333
for needy sexy people.

11:01.567 --> 11:05.066
I just heard on TV
there's a hurricane coming.

11:05.133 --> 11:06.800
They want everyone to stay where they are.

11:06.867 --> 11:10.867
-We could be trapped together for days!
-Oh, Jesus!

11:15.400 --> 11:19.400
Please protect us and watch over us
in our hour of need.

11:19.467 --> 11:20.767
Amen!

11:25.266 --> 11:29.500
(serene music playing)

11:37.500 --> 11:40.300
Boy, it's really coming down out there.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.200
I've never been through
a hurricane before.

11:43.266 --> 11:44.367
There's nothing to be afraid of.

11:44.433 --> 11:47.934
I've been through a couple of hurricanes.
Actually, they can be kind of fun.

11:48.533 --> 11:50.867
I remember one when I was married.

11:56.734 --> 11:58.934
-Married?
-Mary.

12:00.934 --> 12:04.300
When I was Mary in the Christmas pageant
over at the convent.

12:04.367 --> 12:05.400
Remember that, sister Rose?

12:05.467 --> 12:08.133
Oh, my, yes.
Sister Blanche is quite an actress.

12:08.200 --> 12:11.300
Yeah, she'd have to be to make anyone
believe she was a virgin.

12:17.567 --> 12:20.066
Stanley, you're a pig
in a cheap suit.

12:23.367 --> 12:26.166
-You know, for two cents--
-You could get a better toupee?

12:28.700 --> 12:31.867
Okay, that's it. I've had enough.
I'm not going on with this anymore.

12:31.934 --> 12:34.967
Angelo, look. Saint Francis of Assisi.

12:37.066 --> 12:38.200
What?

12:42.066 --> 12:44.400
Shut up and play ball, you yutz.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.667
Uh, false alarm. Never mind.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.600
Let's all go to bed.

12:49.867 --> 12:51.633
Come on, Angelo.
You can sleep in my room.

12:51.700 --> 12:53.867
Oh, yeah.
Well, won't it be crowded?

12:53.934 --> 12:56.200
Please. In Sicily, we slept four in a bed.

12:56.266 --> 12:58.066
Yeah, but there's six of us.

12:58.767 --> 13:02.533
-I meant just you and me.
-Oh, fancy.

13:03.667 --> 13:06.266
Oh, come on. Let's go to bed.

13:06.333 --> 13:09.834
-Yeah, I'm beat.
-Me, too.

13:09.900 --> 13:11.033
Me too.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.934
-Ow.
-(door shuts)

13:22.166 --> 13:26.800
(mellow music playing)

13:30.367 --> 13:31.767
(knock on door)

13:32.600 --> 13:35.467
-Who is it?
-It's uncle Angelo.

13:38.633 --> 13:39.934
Come in.

13:41.166 --> 13:45.700
-Dorothy, would you do me a favor?
-Of course, uncle Angelo. Anything.

13:45.767 --> 13:48.166
I want you to sleep with this man.

13:50.467 --> 13:51.500
Forget it.

13:52.300 --> 13:55.567
I'm begging you as a man of the cloth.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.233
Now I know how Jessica Hahn
must have felt.

14:04.333 --> 14:07.400
I'm sorry, uncle Angelo.
We had a fight.

14:07.467 --> 14:12.100
I want to go to bed.
So you two kids, please, make up.

14:12.767 --> 14:17.300
-Fine. Fine. We're made up.
-Thank you. Good night. Sweet dreams.

14:19.300 --> 14:20.467
Ahem.

14:22.233 --> 14:25.300
I know it's been a while,
but control yourself. I need some rest.

14:28.533 --> 14:31.600
-What the hell is that for?
-Stay off this bed.

14:31.667 --> 14:34.533
-Where will I sleep?
-On the floor, like any dog.

14:36.367 --> 14:37.700
Just fine.

14:37.767 --> 14:41.433
I don't beg women to get into bed.
Women come to me.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.667
Right after they get approval
on your Mastercard.

14:47.166 --> 14:49.533
-Good night.
-Oh, shut up.

14:59.333 --> 15:04.066
Ha ha ha ha!

15:05.900 --> 15:09.266
Stanley, if you're doing what I think
you're doing, you're in big trouble.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.934
No... I was... I was just remembering...

15:17.400 --> 15:20.667
the first time you made me
sleep on the floor.

15:21.166 --> 15:25.066
Emile Zunt's hidden honeymoon hideaway
in the Poconos.

15:25.633 --> 15:30.967
-Where every cottage is April in Paris.
-And every bathroom, Calcutta in July.

15:32.900 --> 15:34.867
Remember how I convinced you
to sleep with me?

15:35.867 --> 15:37.000
No.

15:38.066 --> 15:40.066

15:40.133 --> 15:42.233

-Stanley, I don't believe this.

15:52.300 --> 15:53.800
You're trying to charm me.

15:53.867 --> 15:55.867
-Is it working?
-I don't think so.

15:57.467 --> 16:01.467
-Then I'll have to pull out the big gun.
-You're wasting your time.

16:01.533 --> 16:03.600
I'm familiar with the big gun.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.100

16:24.567 --> 16:25.667
Dorothy!

16:25.734 --> 16:30.100
-Dorothy, I just had a terrible nightmare!
-What was it?

16:30.166 --> 16:31.200
This.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.433
Break it up.

16:35.533 --> 16:39.066
Stanley, think of me as the Berlin wall.

16:39.133 --> 16:44.166
Try to climb over me, and you'll know what
barbed wire between your legs feel like.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.500
Gotcha.

16:47.734 --> 16:51.400
-Dorothy, how did this start? Cole porter?
-Gershwin.

16:52.433 --> 16:54.767
Thank God I came in time.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.934
(serene music playing)

17:02.667 --> 17:04.600
-(telephone rings)
-I'll get it.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.266
Hello.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.633
Hi, Walter. How are you?

17:09.600 --> 17:12.934
Now I feel like
a caged animal in heat, too.

17:15.633 --> 17:19.133
Ha ha ha! Walter, you naughty boy.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.867
Ha ha! Keep on talking.

17:22.967 --> 17:24.700
What am I wearing?

17:24.767 --> 17:28.767
Well, to be perfectly honest,
a nun's outfit!

17:30.834 --> 17:33.333
Oh, that sounds good to me.

17:34.233 --> 17:38.333
Uh-huh. I'll be over there
just as soon as this storm lets up.

17:38.700 --> 17:39.967
Uh-huh.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.033
He's a leper.

17:54.066 --> 17:56.133
I'm the only one who will touch him.

18:00.900 --> 18:02.900
Good morning.

18:03.433 --> 18:04.600
I'll make some breakfast.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.200
You know, it's such a shame...

18:06.500 --> 18:09.967
you two stuck here
on your 40th anniversary.

18:10.033 --> 18:14.700
-40th anniversary?
-Sure. Today's the 25th, isn't it?

18:14.767 --> 18:17.133
Well, yes. I guess it is.

18:17.834 --> 18:20.967
I remember when my parents celebrated
their 40th anniversary.

18:21.033 --> 18:24.700
They did the cutest thing.
They renewed their marriage vows.

18:26.133 --> 18:27.967
You two should do that.

18:29.533 --> 18:32.200
You've got a priest right here.

18:32.266 --> 18:35.533
It's sweet, it's romantic,
it's spontaneous,

18:35.600 --> 18:37.800
it's the dumbest idea I've ever had.

18:39.734 --> 18:41.000
It's a great idea.

18:41.066 --> 18:42.433
(all) What?

18:42.500 --> 18:45.367
Uh, snookums, could I see you
in the living room?

18:45.433 --> 18:46.567
Sure.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.700
What the hell is wrong with you?
Are you nuts?

18:50.767 --> 18:54.834
The last two days,
you and me together...

18:55.166 --> 18:56.767
brought back many good memories.

18:56.834 --> 19:00.433
Last night in bed together,
I felt something.

19:00.734 --> 19:02.266
That was my mother's knee.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.500
No, besides that.

19:05.834 --> 19:08.300
There was still some of the old magic.

19:08.867 --> 19:11.900
I know we loused things up last time.

19:11.967 --> 19:13.700
I loused things up.

19:14.333 --> 19:16.734
But now we could give it another try.

19:17.433 --> 19:19.300
Babe, I missed you.

19:19.967 --> 19:21.400
I want to go through with the ceremony.

19:21.467 --> 19:23.533
Then we'll go to city hall
and make it legal.

19:24.867 --> 19:28.533
-Stan--
-Dorothy, it's fate, divine intervention.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.066
The hurricane.
Us pretending we're married.

19:31.133 --> 19:34.066
If God didn't want us together again,
he wouldn't have sent a priest.

19:34.133 --> 19:35.600
I'm not a priest.

19:36.734 --> 19:39.767
Angelo, get back here.
What do you mean, you're not a priest?

19:39.834 --> 19:43.700
I cannot go on with
this deception any longer.

19:45.033 --> 19:48.133
I can't marry you. I'm not a priest.
I never was.

19:48.200 --> 19:51.867
-Uncle Angelo, what do you mean?
-I got to sit down.

19:54.700 --> 19:56.433
Let me tell you a story.

19:57.700 --> 19:58.900
Picture it.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.633
Sicily, 1914.

20:04.333 --> 20:07.734
I promised our dear,
sainted mother on her deathbed

20:07.800 --> 20:09.667
I'm going to join the priesthood.

20:10.567 --> 20:12.967
On my way to
the seminary in Palermo,

20:13.033 --> 20:17.300
I stop at a trattoria
for a glass of Chianti.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.800
The waitress that brings
the drink to the table...

20:21.600 --> 20:22.800
is a vision.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.633
Luscious lips, full bosom...

20:28.300 --> 20:30.633
and a behind so round...

20:31.867 --> 20:34.834
so firm you got to fall on your knees

20:34.900 --> 20:39.066
and cry out at its magnificent,
regal beauty.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.700
I'm a butt man.

20:47.834 --> 20:51.233
Anyway, my devotion
to God doesn't waver...

20:51.533 --> 20:55.567
but suddenly the idea of living
with a bunch of guys

20:55.633 --> 21:02.333
in itchy robes doesn't seem quite as
appealing as that tuchis.

21:04.300 --> 21:09.533
So I tear up my priest application,
ask Philomena to marry me,

21:09.600 --> 21:13.266
and we live the next 72 years
in wedded bliss.

21:13.800 --> 21:16.633
Why did you keep it
secret all these years?

21:16.700 --> 21:19.300
I was afraid my family
would turn on me

21:19.367 --> 21:23.600
if they find out I broke that promise.

21:23.667 --> 21:25.867
I promised mama I'd marry Benito,

21:25.934 --> 21:28.967
the town's organ grinder/monkey hat
manufacturer.

21:30.333 --> 21:32.567
-And you didn't do it?
-Please.

21:33.100 --> 21:37.667
I loved my mother,
but I had my life to live, like you.

21:39.033 --> 21:42.700
-Can you ever forgive me?
-Oh, of course, uncle Angelo.

21:42.767 --> 21:45.834
Actually, we've all been deceitful, too.

21:46.467 --> 21:48.266
Stanley and I are divorced.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.867
-I hope you're not disappointed.
-No, I'm thrilled.

21:51.934 --> 21:53.900
I never liked him. He's a yutz.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.333
And we're not really nuns.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.500
We're actually gorgeous private citizens.

22:08.200 --> 22:09.767
Now I'm confused.

22:10.467 --> 22:14.166
Come to the kitchen. I'll fix you some
breakfast and explain the whole thing.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.667
The storm's letting up.

22:17.934 --> 22:20.000
I'm running right over to Walter's.

22:20.066 --> 22:23.934
-Aren't you going to change?
-No.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.700
It's still pretty windy out there.

22:29.767 --> 22:32.867
I'm going outside to see
if I can get airborne.

22:36.367 --> 22:39.700
Well... I'd better get going, too.

22:41.567 --> 22:42.834
Uh, Stan...

22:44.433 --> 22:48.500
-about what you said...
-Hey, Dorothy...

22:49.300 --> 22:51.967
I was kidding. It was a joke.

22:54.266 --> 22:55.500
That's what I figured.

22:56.867 --> 23:00.533
Wait. You didn't think I meant it...
did you?

23:00.600 --> 23:04.133
-No, of course not.
-Of course not.

23:04.200 --> 23:07.567
I'm strictly cheerleaders,
wild parties, and hot tubs.

23:09.100 --> 23:13.367
Stan, before I forget, a deal's a deal.

23:13.900 --> 23:15.166
Here's your 50.

23:16.100 --> 23:17.900
That's ok, Sophia.

23:18.467 --> 23:20.333
This one's on the house.

23:20.400 --> 23:27.033
(calm music playing)

23:27.100 --> 23:28.100
(door closes)

23:34.734 --> 23:36.600
Pull yourself together, pussycat.

23:37.533 --> 23:39.667
Gershwin confused a lot of people.

23:54.934 --> 24:01.967
(theme music playing)
