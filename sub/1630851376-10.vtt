WEBVTT

00:01.133 --> 00:02.675
- Chapter 17.

00:02.775 --> 00:05.799
It was a new year,
a time to look forward.

00:05.899 --> 00:07.201
But as Denise
and her sister, JoJo,

00:07.301 --> 00:09.645
were enjoying a fresh start
to their relationship,

00:09.745 --> 00:12.048
for Tom and Marina,
the new year marked an ending.

00:12.148 --> 00:14.652
To finishing
Sofía Salazar's book.

00:14.752 --> 00:16.654
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo!

00:16.754 --> 00:18.016
- So what's the book called?

00:18.116 --> 00:21.701
- "Even When Poor,
I Felt Rich: My Story."

00:21.801 --> 00:23.424
- That's a good title.
It's like a riddle.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.266
- I just have one more proof,
I gotta change

00:25.366 --> 00:28.871
a couple accent marks,
and then adios, Sofía.

00:28.971 --> 00:29.893
Book comes out
in a couple months,

00:29.973 --> 00:31.395
and with our back-end deal--

00:31.495 --> 00:32.797
- You might be looking
at two people

00:32.897 --> 00:35.280
who finally have their heads
barely above water.

00:35.380 --> 00:36.842
- Oh, that is the dream.

00:36.942 --> 00:39.807
- Tom finally felt flush enough
to replace his old watch.

00:39.907 --> 00:42.490
- Waterproof
up to 100 metres, so yeah,

00:42.590 --> 00:44.894
won't be taking this bad boy
off in the shower. [laughs]

00:44.994 --> 00:46.656
- Wow,
even your happy things are sad.

00:46.756 --> 00:48.138
- Problem is,
the band is loose

00:48.238 --> 00:49.500
no matter
how much I tighten it.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.142
- Curse
of the bird-wristed boy.

00:51.242 --> 00:52.304
- My watch guy
can probably fix that.

00:52.404 --> 00:54.106
- You have a watch guy?

00:54.206 --> 00:55.869
- Well, no, he's technically
my Jet Ski guy,

00:55.969 --> 00:57.631
but watches
are his side hustle.

00:57.731 --> 00:58.793
I'll call him right now.

00:58.893 --> 00:59.534
- You don't have
to call him right now.

00:59.614 --> 01:00.916
- No, no.
No big deal.

01:01.016 --> 01:02.959
Yeah, I'll just excuse myself

01:03.059 --> 01:06.043
and handle that right now.

01:06.143 --> 01:07.285
Just go do that right now.

01:07.385 --> 01:10.008
- Okay.
Thank you.

01:10.108 --> 01:12.832
[laughter]

01:15.716 --> 01:18.019
- I'll be right back.
You guys keep practicing.

01:18.119 --> 01:19.982
[giggles]

01:20.082 --> 01:22.145
Wait, do you actually
have a Jet Ski guy?

01:22.245 --> 01:23.467
- Did that come off
a little douchey?

01:23.567 --> 01:25.470
- Not a little.

01:25.570 --> 01:28.033
[laughter]

01:28.133 --> 01:29.555
Okay, we need
to be more careful.

01:29.655 --> 01:31.558
- Yeah,
that's a good point.

01:31.658 --> 01:32.880
No need to rock the boat.

01:32.980 --> 01:34.442
Unless we're having sex
on a boat.

01:34.542 --> 01:36.164
I have a boat, you know.

01:36.264 --> 01:38.648
- You know you don't have
to try so hard to impress me.

01:38.748 --> 01:40.410
It's not like we're a thing
or anything.

01:40.510 --> 01:41.732
It's just fun.

01:41.832 --> 01:43.735
- Yeah, so much fun.
Secret fun in closets.

01:43.835 --> 01:45.698
That's all it is.

01:45.798 --> 01:48.141
- We should get back.
Garage in 45 minutes?

01:48.241 --> 01:49.182
- See you there.

01:49.282 --> 01:51.426
[laughter]

01:51.526 --> 01:53.548
- Hey.

01:53.648 --> 01:55.711
- Hey, what's up?
How are you?

01:55.811 --> 01:57.554
- Kelvin went beast mode
on his TikTok dance

01:57.654 --> 01:59.597
and spilled some
cranberry juice on the rug,

01:59.697 --> 02:01.760
so I'm just gonna
grab some stain remover.

02:01.860 --> 02:03.602
- No, no, it's cool.
- No, I don't mind.

02:03.702 --> 02:04.604
It's fine.
- It's all good.

02:04.704 --> 02:05.886
No, seriously.
It's all good.

02:05.986 --> 02:07.207
- But it's gonna set.
Cranberry sets.

02:07.307 --> 02:08.770
- I've been meaning to replace
that rug anyway.

02:08.870 --> 02:12.174
I never really liked
the foot--the foot feel.

02:12.274 --> 02:13.416
- Are you okay?

02:13.516 --> 02:17.141
- Me? I'm just lonely.
Yeah, you know.

02:17.241 --> 02:18.783
Especially with Gretchen
at her mom's house,

02:18.883 --> 02:21.828
I just--just don't have that
special someone in my life.

02:21.928 --> 02:23.670
- Yeah.

02:23.770 --> 02:25.553
- Sometimes it's like
I forgot how to kiss.

02:25.653 --> 02:29.078
- Connor, you poor thing.
- It's tough.

02:29.178 --> 02:32.402
- You know, he who has family
is never truly alone.

02:32.502 --> 02:33.644
- Aw, that's beautiful.
- Yeah.

02:33.744 --> 02:35.967
- That's beautiful. Wow.

02:36.067 --> 02:38.070
Yeah. Powerful words.

02:40.473 --> 02:41.655
- Forgotten how to kiss, huh?

02:41.755 --> 02:43.498
- I really liked that rug too.

02:43.598 --> 02:44.739
[upbeat music]

02:44.839 --> 02:47.243
- ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪

02:49.245 --> 02:50.467
- Sorry, lo siento.

02:50.567 --> 02:51.989
Can you check again,
por favor?

02:52.089 --> 02:53.551
Hey, I'm talking
to this woman in Puerto Rico.

02:53.651 --> 02:54.673
I'm trying to figure out
the spelling

02:54.773 --> 02:56.596
of Sofía's elementary school,

02:56.696 --> 02:58.438
but she keeps saying that she
didn't go there or something.

02:58.538 --> 02:59.840
Can you please?

02:59.940 --> 03:01.282
- You better credit me
in your book.

03:01.382 --> 03:03.385
- Hola!
[speaking Spanish]

03:10.795 --> 03:11.897
- Marina?
- I have my own

03:11.997 --> 03:12.898
interview style.

03:12.998 --> 03:15.001
Sí, oye.

03:18.606 --> 03:20.609
Okay.

03:23.893 --> 03:25.035
Yeah, she didn't go there.

03:25.135 --> 03:26.998
- What? No.
She did.

03:27.098 --> 03:28.760
Listen, "Across
from the plantain farm

03:28.860 --> 03:30.362
"where my family toiled
in the sun

03:30.462 --> 03:31.925
"sat a one-room schoolhouse.

03:32.025 --> 03:34.168
"It was here that I learned
not just my ABCs

03:34.268 --> 03:37.953
but the value of community,
of breaking bread together."

03:39.275 --> 03:40.256
Wow.

03:40.356 --> 03:43.501
- Toiled in the sun.
Huh.

03:43.601 --> 03:45.623
- What?
- Plantain farm, you say?

03:45.723 --> 03:46.625
- Where are you going
with this?

03:46.725 --> 03:48.728
- Put on a pot of coffee.

03:57.940 --> 04:00.164
University district hospital.

04:00.264 --> 04:03.288
- Come on,
she told me she was born

04:03.388 --> 04:05.331
"in the back
of my parents' tiny shack,

04:05.431 --> 04:07.734
"a structure held together
with equal parts tar paper

04:07.834 --> 04:09.817
and love."
God, that is good writing.

04:09.917 --> 04:13.422
- I knew she was bad news.
I mean, look at all of this.

04:13.522 --> 04:16.266
Her whole rags-to-riches story
is a lie.

04:16.366 --> 04:18.229
She was born in
the best hospital in San Juan.

04:18.329 --> 04:20.792
She attended
the Dorado Preparatory School,

04:20.892 --> 04:23.556
and her father,
he isn't a farmer.

04:23.656 --> 04:24.597
He owns a copper mine.

04:24.697 --> 04:25.839
- This is a disaster.

04:25.939 --> 04:27.201
- And she doesn't have
an alibi

04:27.301 --> 04:28.382
for the night of the murder
of Miguel Alvarez.

04:28.463 --> 04:29.845
- Wait, what?

04:29.945 --> 04:31.447
- That one's more of a reach.

04:31.547 --> 04:34.050
- I don't know what to do.
I mean, I'm complicit in fraud.

04:34.150 --> 04:35.252
- Let's not freak out just yet.

04:35.352 --> 04:36.414
The first thing
that we need to do

04:36.514 --> 04:37.856
is just talk to Sofía.

04:37.956 --> 04:39.137
- Right.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.260
- Okay.
Hey, yes.

04:41.360 --> 04:45.186
There are certain parts
of my life that I, um--

04:45.286 --> 04:47.109
Cómo qué se dice?
Um...

04:47.209 --> 04:48.470
fudged?

04:48.570 --> 04:50.673
- Fudged? You told me
you lived in a shack.

04:50.773 --> 04:52.756
- Because there was a shack
on the grounds of our estate.

04:52.856 --> 04:54.399
You know, the gardener
lived there.

04:54.499 --> 04:56.802
- The title of the book is
"Even When Poor, I Felt Rich."

04:56.902 --> 04:59.005
You felt rich
'cause you were rich.

04:59.105 --> 05:00.407
- My God,
you're overreacting, Tom.

05:00.507 --> 05:01.929
You are so cute.

05:02.029 --> 05:03.331
Marina, if I squint,

05:03.431 --> 05:05.374
I--I can see
why you're attracted to him.

05:05.474 --> 05:07.457
- Flattery's not gonna work
anymore, Sofía.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.580
Tell us what you know
about Miguel Alvarez.

05:09.680 --> 05:10.581
- Who?
- I don't know.

05:10.681 --> 05:11.903
This--this one's her thing.

05:12.003 --> 05:13.185
- Her eyes darted to the left.
That's a tell.

05:13.285 --> 05:14.707
- Yeah, okay.
- Look, Tom.

05:14.807 --> 05:16.629
Now, if this information
goes out,

05:16.729 --> 05:17.751
the book might not.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.473
And there is a lot--

05:19.573 --> 05:22.517
listen to me--a lot of money
at stake for both of us.

05:22.617 --> 05:24.040
- Okay, okay.

05:24.140 --> 05:25.962
Tell you what, we'll just delay
the book and rewrite it.

05:26.062 --> 05:27.364
- Or we do nothing,

05:27.464 --> 05:29.287
and nobody will ever know
the truth, hmm?

05:29.387 --> 05:30.609
- But we will.

05:30.709 --> 05:33.973
- [laughs]
My God, you're so dramatic.

05:34.073 --> 05:35.616
Tom, I--I love her,
but I--I gotta go.

05:35.716 --> 05:37.458
You know, I am introducing
a new ceviche tonight,

05:37.558 --> 05:38.500
so bye-bye.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.602
[speaking Spanish]

05:42.285 --> 05:43.326
- Yeah, I'm starting to think
she did murder that guy.

05:43.406 --> 05:45.149
- Right?

05:45.249 --> 05:46.911
- Kel, we all love
your dance moves.

05:47.011 --> 05:49.154
They are very sick and dope.

05:49.254 --> 05:51.317
But we don't love it
when you jump out of a loft.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.759
- Mm.
- Yesterday Connor's rug.

05:52.859 --> 05:54.281
Today your elbow?

05:54.381 --> 05:55.924
- Uncle Connor said
he didn't care about the rug.

05:56.024 --> 05:57.766
- Well, he's not himself
right now.

05:57.866 --> 05:59.368
He's lonely.

05:59.468 --> 06:01.772
He just needs someone
to come along

06:01.872 --> 06:03.414
and knock him
off his feet.

06:03.514 --> 06:04.496
both: Oh!

06:04.596 --> 06:06.138
- I'm so sorry.

06:06.238 --> 06:07.339
- No, I'm sorry.

06:07.439 --> 06:08.541
- No, it's my fault.

06:08.641 --> 06:10.424
I tend to not look
where I'm going.

06:10.524 --> 06:12.527
One of these days,
I'm gonna end up in a hospital.

06:14.609 --> 06:16.072
Get it?
Hospital?

06:16.172 --> 06:18.174
- Yes.
Yeah.

06:19.576 --> 06:21.399
A sense of humour.
Check.

06:21.499 --> 06:23.001
- Hey, Kelvin.

06:23.101 --> 06:25.725
I'm Dr. Kylie.
I hear you hurt your elbow.

06:25.825 --> 06:28.168
- Yeah, I'm an active preteen.
Been here twice this month.

06:28.268 --> 06:30.251
- Same as me.
I just started yesterday.

06:30.351 --> 06:32.374
- Welcome
to Resource Urgent Care.

06:32.474 --> 06:33.456
You're going to want
to check out

06:33.556 --> 06:34.537
the vending machine
on four.

06:34.637 --> 06:36.460
Sometimes it gives
two Snickers.

06:36.560 --> 06:39.023
- Good tip.
- [laughs]

06:39.123 --> 06:40.425
- I'm still getting
my bearings.

06:40.525 --> 06:43.830
New job, new city,
new everything.

06:43.930 --> 06:45.232
- New everything?

06:45.332 --> 06:48.076
Did you move to town alone
or...

06:48.176 --> 06:50.359
- Yep.
Single doctor in the big city.

06:50.459 --> 06:51.841
- Single.

06:51.941 --> 06:52.802
- All right,
I'll be right back.

06:52.902 --> 06:56.127
- Okay.
We'll be here.

06:56.227 --> 06:58.530
- What's your game here?

06:58.630 --> 07:00.213
- I think she might be
a good match for Uncle Connor.

07:00.313 --> 07:02.896
- Hmm, I can see it.

07:02.996 --> 07:04.458
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
could I go to jail?

07:04.558 --> 07:06.982
I mean, I don't think so.
My name's not on the book.

07:07.082 --> 07:08.344
People are gonna know
that I wrote it.

07:08.444 --> 07:09.245
Remember what
"The Dallas Morning News" said?

07:09.325 --> 07:10.347
I have...
- You have...

07:10.447 --> 07:11.408
both: A very distinctive
writing style.

07:11.488 --> 07:13.391
- Yup.
- Hey.

07:13.491 --> 07:14.793
Got your watch.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.635
My guy had to replace the band
with one called

07:16.735 --> 07:19.159
the Little Executive.

07:19.259 --> 07:21.923
It's very popular
amongst bar mitzvah boys.

07:22.023 --> 07:24.486
Sorry, men.
- [sighs]

07:24.586 --> 07:25.808
- What's up?
What's going on with you guys?

07:25.908 --> 07:29.213
- There is a um...situation.

07:29.313 --> 07:30.655
- What kind of sitch?

07:30.755 --> 07:34.580
- Let's just say we know
something about...someone.

07:34.680 --> 07:38.265
- A secret that person
wants to keep quiet.

07:38.365 --> 07:40.468
- Oh.

07:40.568 --> 07:42.030
What do you mean?
What kind of secret?

07:42.130 --> 07:45.155
Is it about...
someone close to you?

07:45.255 --> 07:47.158
- Very close, yeah.
- Yeah.

07:47.258 --> 07:51.203
- Well, in that case, I'd say
how about we keep this quiet

07:51.303 --> 07:53.086
and be cool about this,
huh, guys?

07:53.186 --> 07:54.367
- But how can we?

07:54.467 --> 07:57.251
Keeping the secret
feels so dirty.

07:57.351 --> 08:01.037
Although there is the potential
for money if we--we keep quiet.

08:02.358 --> 08:05.142
- Looking for a bribe, really?

08:05.242 --> 08:06.544
That's how you want
to play this?

08:06.644 --> 08:07.986
- What? No.
I--I don't think

08:08.086 --> 08:10.089
the publisher would
pay a bribe even if we were.

08:11.451 --> 08:13.955
- Wait, what are you
talking about?

08:14.055 --> 08:15.276
- What are you talking about?

08:15.376 --> 08:16.999
- Publish--
Oh, is this about the cookbook?

08:17.099 --> 08:19.542
- Hypothetically.
And it's a memoir.

08:21.184 --> 08:23.167
- Oh, yeah.
Okay.

08:23.267 --> 08:26.051
Oh, well, if you kept
this work-related secret,

08:26.151 --> 08:27.934
would you be
breaking the law?

08:28.034 --> 08:29.296
Like, would you be smuggling in

08:29.396 --> 08:31.339
millions of off-brand
Korean emery boards

08:31.439 --> 08:33.582
or, like, violating
any Bulgarian laws

08:33.682 --> 08:35.684
governing resource extraction
or anything like that?

08:36.806 --> 08:37.707
- No.

08:37.807 --> 08:39.710
- There might be a murder,

08:39.810 --> 08:42.073
but, um, I don't have enough
to convict.

08:42.173 --> 08:44.076
- Ah, well, then keep
the money.

08:44.176 --> 08:45.558
It's business.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.661
You earned it,
my little executive.

08:49.303 --> 08:51.246
- What were you talking about?
- What?

08:51.346 --> 08:52.227
- No, earlier,
what were you talking about?

08:52.307 --> 08:53.770
- Man, that's crazy.

08:53.870 --> 08:56.073
Damn, it's getting late.
Gotta dip.

08:58.716 --> 08:59.898
- Hey, how's Kelvin?

08:59.998 --> 09:01.941
- Oh, it's just a sprain.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.743
And urgent care
gave us a punch card.

09:03.843 --> 09:05.466
One more visit,
we get a free splint.

09:05.566 --> 09:06.467
- Mm.

09:06.567 --> 09:07.549
And I want to let you know

09:07.649 --> 09:09.391
that I met someone.

09:09.491 --> 09:11.314
- You met someone?
- Yeah, a doctor.

09:11.414 --> 09:13.637
Her name's Elizabeth,
and she is so smart

09:13.737 --> 09:18.163
and so funny and athletic,
and she's just so cool.

09:18.263 --> 09:20.727
- Wow. Okay.
That's--she sounds great.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.569
- Yeah.
- So, um, just to be clear,

09:22.669 --> 09:24.212
you're leaving me?

09:24.312 --> 09:26.174
- No, I want
to introduce her to Connor.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.337
- Oh, Denise, no, no,
we--we have got

09:28.437 --> 09:30.540
to stop interfering
in Connor's relationships.

09:30.640 --> 09:33.625
Do you remember what happened
with Jessica and Lindsey?

09:33.725 --> 09:35.387
- Exactly.

09:35.487 --> 09:37.270
We kind of messed things up
for him, so karmically,

09:37.370 --> 09:39.994
it's on us
to help him find someone.

09:40.094 --> 09:41.636
You should've seen him
at brunch, Lulu.

09:41.736 --> 09:43.518
He is so lonely.

09:43.618 --> 09:45.281
- Well, I mean,
it could be handy

09:45.381 --> 09:46.603
to have a doctor
in the family next time

09:46.703 --> 09:48.605
Kelvin goes full Kelvin.
- Mm-hmm.

09:48.705 --> 09:51.009
- Plus, I have this thing
happening with my jaw.

09:51.109 --> 09:53.572
It's like a--like
a clicking sound.

09:53.672 --> 09:54.974
Do you hear that?
- I don't.

09:55.074 --> 09:57.077
- It's like Pop Rocks
in there.

09:57.918 --> 09:59.300
- The book will probably
be a hit.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.542
- I'd buy it.

10:00.642 --> 10:01.583
- A lot more money for us.

10:01.683 --> 10:03.686
- Money never hurt anyone.

10:04.728 --> 10:06.711
- So we're gonna let the book
be published?

10:06.811 --> 10:08.193
- I think we have to.

10:08.293 --> 10:10.295
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's the right move.

10:11.096 --> 10:13.099
- [sighs]

10:16.023 --> 10:19.067
[watch ticking]

10:30.483 --> 10:31.545
It's just so loud.
- I know.

10:31.645 --> 10:32.666
Connor's watch guy must have

10:32.766 --> 10:34.028
jacked up the sound
or something.

10:34.128 --> 10:36.131
- Stash it in the rice.
- Bye.

10:38.935 --> 10:40.938
- Good.
Now we can sleep.

10:42.580 --> 10:44.162
- Actually, you know,
I'm gonna do a little cleaning.

10:44.262 --> 10:45.604
- Good idea.
I'm gonna sweep the floors.

10:45.704 --> 10:46.766
- I'm gonna get
the kids' high chairs.

10:46.866 --> 10:49.049
God, this house is so dirty.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.972
- Okay, I'm off
to my work thing.

10:51.072 --> 10:52.374
- Not that I don't know
what your work is,

10:52.474 --> 10:53.736
but what is your work?

10:53.836 --> 10:55.418
- Well, like, tonight,

10:55.518 --> 10:57.421
I'm attending this
climate change fundraiser

10:57.521 --> 10:58.783
and I'm being paid
to take selfies

10:58.883 --> 11:00.184
by an energy water.

11:00.284 --> 11:02.708
- Hmm.
- Hmm, cleared that right up.

11:02.808 --> 11:03.709
- So what are you guys up to?

11:03.809 --> 11:05.592
- Well, Connor's coming over,

11:05.692 --> 11:09.477
and so is a woman
we're setting him up with.

11:09.577 --> 11:10.799
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:10.899 --> 11:13.363
- Cool. Fun.
- Yeah! Yeah.

11:13.463 --> 11:15.165
- So does he know
about this big setup or...

11:15.265 --> 11:16.968
- No, no,
it's gonna be a surprise, like a, um,

11:17.068 --> 11:19.491
"Oh, hey, now that you're
both here," you know?

11:19.591 --> 11:21.173
- Oh, good.
I mean, not that I care.

11:21.273 --> 11:23.296
I'm just trying to go to work.

11:23.396 --> 11:25.540
[door slams]
- Hey.

11:25.640 --> 11:26.941
- Hello.
- Hi.

11:27.041 --> 11:28.784
- It's nice to see you again.

11:28.884 --> 11:32.229
- As it is to...
see you as well.

11:32.329 --> 11:33.911
- What are you,
vice presidents at a bank?

11:34.011 --> 11:35.273
- Hey, you guys
should let him in

11:35.373 --> 11:36.875
on your big plans for tonight.

11:36.975 --> 11:39.279
I just think
it'll be so fun.

11:39.379 --> 11:42.884
- Okay, fine,
instead of boring old pizza

11:42.984 --> 11:44.686
and another lesbian
historical drama...

11:44.786 --> 11:46.328
- Neither are boring.

11:46.428 --> 11:47.350
- We invited over a lady
that we think you'll like.

11:47.430 --> 11:49.432
- She's great.
She's a doctor.

11:50.995 --> 11:52.617
- You set me up?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

11:52.717 --> 11:55.421
- Oh, that's so nice.
That's so nice.

11:55.521 --> 11:58.305
I kinda wish you had told me
first, though.

11:58.405 --> 11:59.947
- Well, just go in
with an open mind.

12:00.047 --> 12:01.069
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you never know.

12:01.169 --> 12:03.632
She could be the one.
- Uh, maybe.

12:03.732 --> 12:06.236
- Yeah.
- Okay, bye.

12:06.336 --> 12:08.799
- Yeah, I'm gonna--you guys
have so much fun.

12:08.899 --> 12:10.201
- We will, yeah.
- Okay.

12:10.301 --> 12:12.304
- Okay, bye.

12:13.346 --> 12:16.730
- Oh, hi.
- Damn.

12:16.830 --> 12:19.374
- Elizabeth.
Hi, welcome.

12:19.474 --> 12:20.896
You were just going.

12:20.996 --> 12:23.219
- Actually, climate change
can wait.

12:23.319 --> 12:25.322
This seems like the place
to be tonight.

12:28.286 --> 12:29.308
[laughter]
- And, Connor,

12:29.408 --> 12:30.750
Elizabeth used to play lacrosse

12:30.850 --> 12:31.751
just like you did.

12:31.851 --> 12:33.554
- Wow.
- Yeah.

12:33.654 --> 12:35.997
Well, women's games are
totally different than men's.

12:36.097 --> 12:37.479
Women's are all about...
both: Finesse.

12:37.579 --> 12:38.761
- Yeah
- Yeah.

12:38.861 --> 12:41.044
Men's are more like
run and smash.

12:41.144 --> 12:42.806
[laughter]

12:42.906 --> 12:45.610
- Look at these two
with their inside jokes.

12:45.710 --> 12:47.212
- Okay.

12:47.312 --> 12:48.514
- You know, I actually
almost played in college,

12:48.594 --> 12:50.657
but then I busted my knee

12:50.757 --> 12:52.780
stage diving
at a Blink-182 concert.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.544
- No way. Connor, Connor,
did you hear that?

12:55.644 --> 12:57.146
- Yeah, yeah, no, I heard it.
I'm right here.

12:57.246 --> 12:58.087
- His bedroom
used to be covered

12:58.167 --> 12:59.509
in Blink-182 posters.

12:59.609 --> 13:00.951
- Aw. [laughs]

13:01.051 --> 13:02.474
- So cute.

13:02.574 --> 13:06.159
I'm gonna go get
another glass of wine.

13:06.259 --> 13:08.842
- So lacrosse, Blink-182,
discuss.

13:08.942 --> 13:10.885
- Yeah, I'm gonna go get
some more ice.

13:10.985 --> 13:12.127
- Um, while you're here,

13:12.227 --> 13:15.131
I have this clicking
happening in my jaw.

13:15.231 --> 13:16.353
Do you think you could
check that out for me?

13:16.433 --> 13:17.735
- Yeah, absolutely.
- It's like a--

13:17.835 --> 13:19.737
do you hear that?

13:19.837 --> 13:22.061
- You know I had nothing
to do with this.

13:22.161 --> 13:24.865
- I know. I mean, my sister's
got a good eye.

13:24.965 --> 13:29.271
She's a hot lacrosse-playing,
Blink-180 whatever.

13:29.371 --> 13:31.153
- 182.
You don't have to be jealous.

13:31.253 --> 13:34.117
- [scoffs]
Who's jealous?

13:34.217 --> 13:36.761
I'm saying it's a great match.
You should go for it.

13:36.861 --> 13:40.046
- But what about...

13:40.146 --> 13:43.330
- What about what?
You and me?

13:43.430 --> 13:45.453
Like we said,
it's not anything, right?

13:45.553 --> 13:46.735
- Right.
Yeah.

13:46.835 --> 13:47.896
- Look, if you want
to go after homegirl,

13:47.996 --> 13:49.999
don't let me stop you.

13:51.201 --> 13:51.862
- Fine.
Maybe I will.

13:51.962 --> 13:52.903
- Good
- Great.

13:53.003 --> 13:55.006
- Awesome.
- Sublime.

13:56.849 --> 13:57.890
- Do you hear that, though?
You can hear it, right?

13:57.970 --> 13:59.072
- Yeah.
- It's like

13:59.172 --> 14:00.754
a medieval drawbridge.

14:00.854 --> 14:03.818
[vacuum cleaner whirring]

14:05.100 --> 14:06.722
- What are you doing?

14:06.822 --> 14:09.046
- Ah! Hey, sweetie.
- Ah.

14:09.146 --> 14:10.448
- Remember how I was vacuuming
in the kitchen,

14:10.548 --> 14:11.729
the dining room,

14:11.829 --> 14:13.492
and then under our bed
and under your bed

14:13.592 --> 14:16.095
and then out on the patio
for a little bit?

14:16.195 --> 14:17.497
Now I'm doing up here.

14:17.597 --> 14:19.660
- And I am de-linting
the couch.

14:19.760 --> 14:23.225
Oh, and look what I found
in here, a fidget spinner.

14:23.325 --> 14:25.388
Do you still like using
a fidget spinner?

14:25.488 --> 14:26.990
- You guys never clean.

14:27.090 --> 14:28.593
- That's not true. We do.
- We love cleaning.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.555
- Let me get a little bit
of that. [laughs]

14:30.655 --> 14:32.758
- Hey, do you think
that maybe we feel

14:32.858 --> 14:36.283
just a little bit guilty
about keeping Sofía's secret?

14:36.383 --> 14:37.886
- What?
No.

14:37.986 --> 14:40.249
Nah, I think it's just,
when you really open your eyes,

14:40.349 --> 14:43.293
you realise
everything's very dirty.

14:43.393 --> 14:45.496
You know, we live in a dirty,
dirty world, and you and I

14:45.596 --> 14:46.738
are just trying to clean it up,
and, oh, my God,

14:46.838 --> 14:48.020
I think I can still hear
that watch ticking.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.782
- It's insanely loud.
- Right?

14:49.882 --> 14:51.905
- And that's the crazy thing
about diphtheria.

14:52.005 --> 14:53.427
It's super infectious.

14:53.527 --> 14:56.151
- Yeah, yeah.
- Kind of like Blink-182.

14:56.251 --> 14:58.114
- [laughs]

14:58.214 --> 15:00.717
That's hilarious.
We're both so into Blink.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.000
- Yeah, we get it.

15:03.100 --> 15:04.883
- You know, we--we should
do this again sometime

15:04.983 --> 15:07.206
but like a--a real date,
you know,

15:07.306 --> 15:08.688
in a--in a sister-free
environment.

15:08.788 --> 15:10.731
- And I am a lock
for maid of honour.

15:10.831 --> 15:12.173
- Okay.
Be cool.

15:12.273 --> 15:13.335
- That'd be fun.

15:13.435 --> 15:15.177
I'd love to do something
by the water.

15:15.277 --> 15:17.340
I feel like I've barely seen
the bay since I moved here.

15:17.440 --> 15:18.862
- Oh, they say the best way
to take in the bay

15:18.962 --> 15:21.466
is--is by boat,
and I have a boat.

15:21.566 --> 15:23.188
- I pretty much grew up
on a boat.

15:23.288 --> 15:24.951
- What?
- Yeah.

15:25.051 --> 15:26.673
- Ah! Oh, my God.
[cell phone chimes]

15:26.773 --> 15:28.796
Look, I just got a match
on Raya.

15:28.896 --> 15:30.038
I'm gonna go.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.140
- Oh, no.
Bye.

15:33.743 --> 15:36.807
- So should we set it up
for this Saturday?

15:36.907 --> 15:38.810
- For what?

15:38.910 --> 15:40.773
- Sailing.
You two.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.295
On a boat.
'Cause of me.

15:42.395 --> 15:44.137
- It's gonna be so fun.

15:44.237 --> 15:45.739
Okay, you must have heard that,
right?

15:45.839 --> 15:46.821
It's like a woodpecker.

15:46.921 --> 15:48.583
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do it again.

15:48.683 --> 15:51.748
- Here's one, the book's a hit,
it'll lead to more jobs.

15:51.848 --> 15:54.191
- So another sock
for the keep quiet pile.

15:54.291 --> 15:56.234
- And I mean, Sofía lied,

15:56.334 --> 15:58.717
but it's not like she
committed a crime

15:58.817 --> 16:01.121
that we know of.

16:01.221 --> 16:03.844
- We'll call this Sofía
not a murderer yet.

16:03.944 --> 16:06.168
- [chuckles]

16:06.268 --> 16:07.810
Well, still just one sock

16:07.910 --> 16:10.333
in the expose
Sofía's secret pile.

16:10.433 --> 16:12.336
- Seeing it laid out like this,
I feel better.

16:12.436 --> 16:13.778
I do.
- Yeah, it's the right move.

16:13.878 --> 16:16.061
- Yeah.
- More cleaning?

16:16.161 --> 16:18.425
- Oh, no, sweetie.

16:18.525 --> 16:21.269
This is kind of
a complicated grown-up thing.

16:21.369 --> 16:23.151
- We had to make a decision,

16:23.251 --> 16:26.756
so we decided to separate
baby sock piles into two.

16:26.856 --> 16:28.398
And for every reason
we decided one way,

16:28.498 --> 16:30.201
we'd put a sock in this pile,

16:30.301 --> 16:31.923
and for the other way,
that pile.

16:32.023 --> 16:33.085
- What's that one
by itself for?

16:33.185 --> 16:35.929
- Oh, this one's just a--

16:36.029 --> 16:37.651
well, it's kind of 'cause Daddy
felt guilty

16:37.751 --> 16:42.017
about not being able
to tell 100% of the truth.

16:42.117 --> 16:45.422
- You mean lying.
- Um...

16:45.522 --> 16:49.027
well, I wouldn't say--
I didn't say lying

16:49.127 --> 16:52.672
because it's not
technically lying.

16:52.772 --> 16:55.195
But if you--I guess if you look
at the definition of--

16:55.295 --> 16:58.360
- Okay, um, Camila,
can you give us a minute?

16:58.460 --> 17:02.085
And please stop silently
judging us.

17:02.185 --> 17:04.829
Thank you.
- [sighs]

17:09.675 --> 17:12.359
- Disappointing our daughter.
- Yeah.

17:15.323 --> 17:17.907
[cell phone ringing]

17:18.007 --> 17:19.309
- It's my agent.

17:19.409 --> 17:20.470
- Remember, we did
the right thing.

17:20.570 --> 17:22.573
- Right.

17:23.414 --> 17:25.758
Amanda, what's going on?

17:25.858 --> 17:27.240
- An anonymous source
leaked some info

17:27.340 --> 17:28.842
about Sofía Salazar.

17:28.942 --> 17:32.327
She made up
her rags-to-riches story.

17:32.427 --> 17:35.411
- What?
- She lied to us, Tom,

17:35.511 --> 17:37.534
and now it looks like
the book's not coming out.

17:37.634 --> 17:40.458
- Oh, my--what are you
talking--that's crazy.

17:40.558 --> 17:42.501
That's crazy.
- Okay, pull it back, honey.

17:42.601 --> 17:43.662
- Okay.

17:43.762 --> 17:45.946
- So what are we
gonna sell next?

17:46.046 --> 17:48.429
- There's always my novel.

17:48.529 --> 17:50.672
- Ooh, a novel.
What's it about?

17:50.772 --> 17:52.475
- You've already read
half of it.

17:52.575 --> 17:54.117
Remember, it's about my family.

17:54.217 --> 17:55.919
Three siblings, different
levels of financial success.

17:56.019 --> 17:57.562
- Sounds great.

17:57.662 --> 18:00.045
Too bad you wasted your time
on Sofía's book.

18:00.145 --> 18:01.527
- You talked me into it.

18:01.627 --> 18:03.049
- Who can remember
who did what?

18:03.149 --> 18:05.493
You just get back at it,
Tommy boy.

18:05.593 --> 18:07.295
- [sighs]

18:07.395 --> 18:09.018
Well, back to square one.

18:09.118 --> 18:10.460
- Yeah, we got nothing

18:10.560 --> 18:12.943
without the victim's
phone records.

18:13.043 --> 18:15.266
Oh, you meant financially.
Yeah, sorry.

18:15.366 --> 18:19.152
- It's just, I was looking
forward to some stability.

18:19.252 --> 18:20.393
I guess that's gone.

18:20.493 --> 18:22.116
- Listen, we're gonna
be okay, okay?

18:22.216 --> 18:23.918
We're gonna work
through this together.

18:24.018 --> 18:25.560
You're gonna finally finish
that novel,

18:25.660 --> 18:28.264
and in the meantime,
I'm gonna go back to work.

18:29.906 --> 18:32.330
- Really? Are you sure?

18:32.430 --> 18:35.174
- Yes. You know,
investigating Sofía

18:35.274 --> 18:38.578
made me realise
I really miss practicing law.

18:38.678 --> 18:40.942
And hey, at least now
you can wear that--that watch.

18:41.042 --> 18:43.044
- Oh, yeah.

18:44.486 --> 18:46.710
Ooh, it's cold.

18:46.810 --> 18:49.313
But you know what?
Feels good.

18:49.413 --> 18:54.601
Watch bought with lies is
now a watch of...righteousness.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.925
- No more telltale ticking.
I can't hear it at all.

18:58.025 --> 19:00.028
- Me neither.

19:00.629 --> 19:02.652
Yeah, that's cause it's broken.
Cold broke it.

19:02.752 --> 19:04.754
I think I'm gonna bring this
back to Connor's watch guy.

19:07.238 --> 19:10.663
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:10.763 --> 19:13.346
- Sorry, I--I think I left
my clip-on ring light here.

19:13.446 --> 19:15.790
- Don't you have, like,
five of those?

19:15.890 --> 19:17.632
- I guess.
Yeah.

19:17.732 --> 19:21.678
So how was the rest of
your date with Dr. Hot Doctor?

19:21.778 --> 19:24.041
- Fine, I guess.

19:24.141 --> 19:25.483
Probably not gonna see
her again.

19:25.583 --> 19:26.685
- Why not?

19:26.785 --> 19:27.847
I thought by now,
you'd be out on the bay

19:27.947 --> 19:29.489
blasting Blink-311.

19:29.589 --> 19:32.213
- It's 182, and you know it.

19:32.313 --> 19:34.175
How was your big date?

19:34.275 --> 19:36.178
- I was tired
and didn't feel like meeting

19:36.278 --> 19:38.281
some club DJ
with frosted tips.

19:39.923 --> 19:45.030
Also, uh, I made it up.

19:45.130 --> 19:46.793
I couldn't compete.

19:46.893 --> 19:49.877
I'm living on my sister's
couch, and she's this--

19:49.977 --> 19:55.885
- She's great,
but she's not--

19:55.985 --> 19:57.988
she's not you.

19:59.150 --> 20:01.373
I feel like I can be myself
around you.

20:01.473 --> 20:02.855
You make me laugh.

20:02.955 --> 20:06.300
You're not impressed
by my incredibly sick house.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.503
- [laughs]

20:08.603 --> 20:11.847
- Not to mention
you're absolutely adorable.

20:14.170 --> 20:18.076
- Oh.
Well, shoot.

20:18.176 --> 20:20.680
I guess now I have
to kiss you.

20:20.780 --> 20:22.782
- Oh.

20:25.386 --> 20:26.367
I'm starting to think
this thing

20:26.467 --> 20:27.850
might actually be a thing.

20:27.950 --> 20:31.895
- Oh, it's definitely a thing.
- Mm-hmm.

20:31.995 --> 20:35.520
- But let's just keep it
between us for now.

20:37.202 --> 20:39.626
Plus, it's kind of hot
sneaking around.

20:39.726 --> 20:41.729
- Right?

20:45.574 --> 20:47.577
- Oh, my God.

20:49.459 --> 20:51.462
Oh, my God!

20:51.525 --> 20:52.626
- So what do you say
to your fans

20:52.726 --> 20:55.028
who feel like you've lied
to them

20:55.128 --> 20:57.071
about your entire life?

20:57.171 --> 21:00.796
- Well, uh, I would say
I am so sorry.

21:00.896 --> 21:03.479
And then I would say
thank God.

21:03.579 --> 21:05.082
- Thank God?

21:05.182 --> 21:07.565
- Yes, because now
I am able to--you know,

21:07.665 --> 21:09.808
to--to embrace my truth

21:09.908 --> 21:11.811
and tell them my real story.

21:11.911 --> 21:14.054
And I'm gonna expose it all
in my new book.

21:14.154 --> 21:16.497
And I'm writing it
with Michael Chabon.

21:16.597 --> 21:17.779
- [groans]
- I can't wait to read it.

21:17.879 --> 21:19.101
- Chabon.

21:19.201 --> 21:20.904
- To think I liked her flan.

21:21.004 --> 21:22.306
- It's gonna be amazing.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.408
[laughter]
